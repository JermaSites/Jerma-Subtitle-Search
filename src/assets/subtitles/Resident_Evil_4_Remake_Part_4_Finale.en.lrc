[ve:60.16.100]

[00:48.71]What's going on?
[00:55.66]What's up?
[01:01.08]Who are we?
[01:02.16]I don't know.
[01:04.26]Chat?
[01:04.54]I mean, you're all individuals here.
[01:07.59]I don't know who you all are, but I know you all are potential individuals.
[01:13.03]I don't know.
[01:18.87]But anyways, hello, how are you?
[01:25.65]What drink is this?
[01:27.88]It is a water with some hydrating powder in it.
[01:32.90]I need some hydration today.
[01:36.16]Feeling a little dehydrated.
[01:42.57]Have I seen Breath of the Wild 2 gameplay?
[01:46.83]No, I haven't.
[01:50.46]I need to beat the first one before I care about the second one.
[01:55.20]Because I will see all the improved gameplay mechanics in the new one and then go, I don't want to play the old one anymore.
[02:02.64]The second you show me like the new glider in the new Breath of the Wild, it's like, well, I got to wait like two weeks.
[02:07.78]I can just play that one.
[02:09.60]Three weeks, whatever it is.
[02:10.78]Was it April, May?
[02:14.80]He's never going to finish Breath of the Wild 1.
[02:17.14]Well, it's funny you say that because that's the exact plan after today.
[02:24.18]I think we are in the last... I want to say like three or four hours of Resident Evil 4.
[02:34.17]Depending on how long it takes.
[02:36.63]Maybe four hours?
[02:38.59]Plus an hour of maybe the extra content.
[02:40.11]I'll try.
[02:40.39]Because what?
[02:42.95]Chapter 13, 14, right?
[02:43.65]Okay.
[02:48.34]No spoilers, please.
[02:49.82]Go back to sorcery.
[02:54.00]Or sorcery.
[02:55.78]I feel bad for sorcery.
[02:56.82]I'm going back to Breath of the Wild, but not sorcery.
[03:05.13]Sorcery shuns in shambles right now.
[03:11.05]Alright, that's it.
[03:12.15]Hey, that was pretty cool.
[03:15.01]Everything started with an S.
[03:20.09]Sorcery Chants.
[03:23.04]Everything has to have... Like, let's get 50 Slugs Steven is the title today.
[03:26.68]That's why I said that.
[03:27.60]Alright, you guys ready?
[03:31.40]Get through the rest of Resident Evil 4?
[03:34.68]You guys good?
[03:37.86]Alliteration.
[03:38.74]Yeah.
[03:39.60]Alliteration nerd.
[03:43.74]I have like a soft spot for alliteration.
[03:47.34]California Circus.
[03:48.52]The Maryland Magicians.
[03:52.69]50 slugs Steven.
[04:00.09]Now I'm not ready to give me a minute.
[04:01.23]Alright, you get a minute.
[04:03.89]You get one minute.
[04:06.11]Hey, you gave me an extra 10 minutes.
[04:09.51]So I'm going to give you an extra one minute.
[04:11.47]I think that's fair.
[04:13.33]I'll give you an extra one minute.
[04:16.59]That's fair.
[04:17.59]Me too?
[04:18.09]Alright, everybody go.
[04:20.07]Go do what you got to do.
[04:21.21]You got one minute.
[04:29.28]Some of you just got really annoyed because I started my stream and the of your washing machine just went off.
[04:38.44]And you're like, I have to go turn that over, dude.
[04:40.43]And it's going to take like 10 fucking minutes.
[04:42.69]Of course, he started right when the washing machine went off.
[04:46.47]This guy.
[04:46.91]You should play Zomboid.
[04:54.84]I said I wanted to, but I don't know.
[04:57.28]The game feels really involved.
[05:00.75]Is Project Zomboid a game where you have to really, really know everything that's going on?
[05:04.01]I feel like I'm going to die in the first 10 minutes and then go, oh, that was... I don't get it, and leave.
[05:08.41]Is that possible?
[05:12.70]Seems like a really cool game.
[05:22.16]That's the point?
[05:22.90]That's exactly what the point is.
[05:24.02]Huh.
[05:25.32]Okay.
[05:29.82]What about another FMV game stream?
[05:32.91]There are a couple of FMV games that have come out that I want to play, but I feel like we played a lot of the really, really important old ones.
[05:41.73]It is actually tough to find an FMV game that I have not played on this stream.
[05:51.25]We've done them all almost.
[05:53.59]I played almost the entire FMV catalog of 3DO games.
[05:57.65]And then before that too, on old PC.
[06:06.80]Bad Mojo is an FMV game.
[06:08.48]Didn't I play that for like 20 minutes and I thought I couldn't control it well?
[06:12.36]Something was wrong.
[06:13.34]I didn't like it.
[06:14.34]I don't know why.
[06:15.38]Something was wrong with that.
[06:16.80]I tried to play it.
[06:17.40]Maybe the port was fucked up and I couldn't capture it.
[06:21.32]It was something weird with that one.
[06:22.48]Alright.
[06:25.55]What about public domain movies?
[06:27.77]Yeah, well, where's my headphones?
[06:28.95]Hold on.
[06:30.67]I don't even know.
[06:31.49]They're not even here.
[06:32.29]Hold on a second.
[07:36.15]OK.
[07:38.79]Found him.
[07:39.11]What do you mean hello?
[07:44.37]I just I told you I had to go VRV for a second.
[07:48.41]What about the Dead Space remake?
[07:49.61]This is a lot of shit that I really want to play.
[07:55.82]Well, we'll see.
[07:57.26]Let's get through this first.
[08:00.10]Resident Evil 4.
[08:03.32]Chapter number.
[08:06.84]14.
[08:06.90]Oh, it's in the junk draw again.
[08:17.66]Well, the forest sequel.
[08:19.56]Oh shit, you guys can't see this one.
[08:26.22]Hey.
[08:30.06]I don't know that I didn't.
[08:31.12]I didn't really play the forest one.
[08:32.88]I have something to ask you.
[08:40.28]Final arc of the game, by the way.
[08:45.85]Don't even say it.
[08:48.07]Did your head get bigger?
[08:50.11]I don't think so.
[08:54.29]Did my head get bigger in two days?
[08:55.85]My head just keeps slowly increasing in size.
[09:07.57]You just think you have.
[09:09.49]I think it's I adjusted the camera.
[09:13.30]Yeah, this is the chapter that has the.
[09:16.38]Scary thing that I don't like, so I'm preparing myself.
[09:20.24]Have you changed data?
[09:22.88]Off Camperman or are you just trying to use me again?
[09:27.45]What do you think?
[09:30.63]You look like it's smelly today.
[09:31.59]Yeah, you're probably right.
[09:37.22]Hardcore run next, coward.
[09:53.07]Yeah, I told you.
[09:53.67]I'm gonna stream standard.
[09:55.29]I have a hardcore gaming mindset though.
[09:57.99]Very important for you to understand.
[10:03.70]And then I'll do hardcore later.
[10:05.04]Hardcore is going to happen on my own time.
[10:07.78]I'm going to play it if I do.
[10:09.68]We've got Breath of the Wild to play.
[10:19.71]Tag me when Jerma lies.
[10:22.51]Oh, that's just your name.
[10:25.98]Time that person out for 30 seconds for having that name.
[10:37.81]Sniper rifle would be pretty good here.
[10:44.05]No rifle.
[10:45.11]Oh, by the way, for those of you that are wondering, yes.
[10:47.67]The reason why the title is 50 Slug Steven.
[10:51.14]If you missed some of these streams, or if you missed the last one, we'll go over it very briefly.
[10:55.06]I put $300,000 into this shotgun.
[10:59.24]It can hold 48 slugs.
[11:02.10]And it shoots a slug every second.
[11:06.35]It seems to be working pretty good.
[11:08.55]Striker Andy.
[11:09.97]Why is your voice so deep today?
[11:11.67]Oh, I had like a f***ing yogurt.
[11:22.56]I had like two yogurts and it made my voice all yogurt-y.
[11:25.78]Nope.
[11:38.68]Wait.
[11:38.86]I don't want to pass up any treasures.
[11:45.42]This thing's been really useful as well.
[11:47.58]At first, I thought it was fucking yogurt.
[11:51.06]I swear to God.
[11:52.26]Don't get scanned by this.
[11:55.35]I can take it out by shooting it, right?
[12:00.59]I can't?
[12:00.95]Alright, I'm not going that way.
[12:06.19]Does this kill you?
[12:08.36]Oh, wait.
[12:17.38]I go up there.
[12:18.66]New items.
[12:20.21]This thing looks kind of cool and easy to handle.
[12:25.69]Oh, it's a magnum.
[12:31.99]Okay.
[12:33.45]Do I... Which one is more powerful?
[12:41.46]This thing is 27 at full power.
[12:46.36]That one, the killer seven is way more powerful.
[12:48.64]Okay.
[12:51.95]That's the best magnum.
[12:53.25]Killer seven by far.
[12:54.11]Yeah.
[13:02.79]So I'm going to sell this.
[13:05.83]It's not the best, but it's good.
[13:07.15]So I should sell this, get that one, and then start upgrading that one.
[13:12.96]butterfly does more damage does it I'll see are you sure butterfly technically has higher power what do you mean by that so wait this if I get this then this would be the one I'm gonna I'm gonna keep this one the exclusive on the butterfly is way more powerful alright well then I'm gonna keep this one you can compare stats I
[13:42.69]Yeah, but I think I have to own it, don't I?
[13:43.99]I think I have to own the weapon to compare stats, don't I?
[13:53.65]Oh, no, I don't.
[13:54.31]Alright.
[14:04.44]I mean, but this thing is upgraded, though.
[14:05.70]24.
[14:05.72]This one's not even upgraded.
[14:11.62]I don't know.
[14:12.54]I think this one's probably going to be stronger.
[14:13.96]But what's the exclusive on this?
[14:17.06]The exclusive is what puts this over the top.
[14:23.71]Alright, so 28, 27 of the exclusive will put this one over the top.
[14:26.93]What's the exclusive on this one?
[14:27.93]Can I see it?
[14:34.08]What is the exclusive on it?
[14:35.82]5 times crit damage?
[14:36.64]Alright, I'm going to keep the one I have.
[14:43.79]thing is done your valuables won't do you much good in the grave okay so let's get rid of these thank you I could sell the golden egg yeah I mean it's it's 10 grand I'm just gonna sell it keep it no no no keep it why sell the egg it's 10 grand it's 10 000 that's 10 000 dollars
[15:16.15]I can't do anything else, so.
[15:23.29]Another upgrade ticket.
[15:29.45]You could make a golden omelet.
[15:31.51]That'd be kind of funny if that was real.
[15:34.56]Is that real?
[15:35.20]That's not real, right?
[15:37.80]You can't make a golden omelet.
[15:44.12]Yes, it is.
[15:50.04]There's no golden omelet.
[15:51.34]You guys are full of shit.
[15:52.57]There's no golden omelet in this game.
[15:56.45]The golden omelet.
[15:58.35]Really?
[16:02.01]Who cooks it?
[16:03.07]How do you make it?
[16:03.71]Yeah, you guys are full of shit.
[16:11.66]You guys are full of shit.
[16:12.44]There's no golden omelet.
[16:13.50]I've played this game like fucking ten times already.
[16:16.52]There's no golden omelet.
[16:25.80]Actually, thanks to the one one guy that said to repair the knife because I would not have Stop What The hell is that Nailgun
[16:58.02]Oh my god.
[17:02.30]Oh shit, run away.
[17:11.47]Whoa.
[17:16.69]Oh my god, watch out.
[17:29.69]I wanna save ammo!
[17:32.77]Nice voice... Did I voice-crack?
[17:35.17]I did?
[17:35.89]When?
[17:38.31]I got a better idea!
[17:47.48]Okay, we just gotta... Every time I start this game again, I have to... I gotta get back into the swing of it.
[17:55.00]50 slugs, Steven.
[17:58.26]Yeah, well, I had no health.
[18:03.14]I didn't have any health.
[18:07.58]I need flashbangs.
[18:16.73]Okay.
[18:20.55]I need some more of this.
[18:23.61]Here we go.
[18:25.19]Flash grenade.
[18:27.01]Thank you.
[18:29.30]That's going to help immensely.
[18:30.68]I'm at max health, so I don't have to worry about yellow herbs anymore.
[18:34.88]Let's go ahead and mix two of them.
[18:40.30]I do not care about yellow herbs.
[18:41.52]I have a max HP now.
[18:43.80]Nice yogurt voice.
[18:48.89]What was that?
[18:50.75]Why did they harmonize that?
[18:53.13]That was very strange.
[18:54.11]Alright, I'm going in now.
[18:58.61]Let's go.
[19:27.77]You know what I'm talking about?
[19:36.66]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[19:42.00]Right?
[19:42.20]I hope people know what I mean by that.
[19:59.28]Where's he going?
[20:00.22]Is he running?
[20:01.28]Oh my god, he's sprinting.
[20:02.62]Okay, hold on.
[20:12.54]Yeah!
[20:25.80]I don't know why when I shoot this, I do that.
[20:30.24]If you watch every time I've shot that shotgun, I've gone, yeah, every time.
[20:36.28]Why?
[20:37.14]Why am I making that sound?
[20:39.34]What's the point?
[20:40.40]Why am I doing that?
[20:41.52]I don't do that with anything else, any other gun I have.
[20:51.53]Guy holding two.
[20:53.71]What?
[20:54.19]Who did that?
[20:54.75]What?
[20:57.27]What's that?
[20:57.63]That guy just got lit the fuck up.
[21:07.97]Don't do it.
[21:11.95]Don't do it.
[21:14.69]Alright, we're good.
[21:19.00]He did the trope.
[21:20.54]He did the squibs.
[21:23.44]The like...
[21:26.51]You know, I love... That's like so... The squib attack on like the person's chest.
[21:44.03]Anytime that they do that in movies where it's like... It's just like what the fuck is going on here?
[22:05.10]What is a squib?
[22:07.16]It's a device that is in a vest.
[22:10.64]In movies and TV shows that has the little, like, spurt come out.
[22:13.61]Like, as if it was, uh, like a, like a getting shot.
[22:18.69]It's a little device that's made for movies.
[22:25.26]Can I move this?
[22:33.87]It's all CGI now?
[22:36.15]It is.
[22:37.73]For the most part.
[22:49.18]They still do use practicals?
[22:50.86]Yeah, I mean, some.
[22:51.90]Depends on what movie, I guess, right?
[22:53.18]Or what show.
[22:57.16]How do I get this milk voice out?
[22:58.96]How do I cure milk voice?
[23:01.38]Anybody know?
[23:06.78]Am I missing anything here?
[23:09.22]There are no treasures.
[23:11.29]I need more water?
[23:12.41]I got some.
[23:16.83]Hold on.
[23:20.15]Is that better?
[23:22.45]No, it's not.
[23:23.89]I should probably lean into it then.
[23:26.21]Yeah.
[23:26.37]I think I'll lean into it then.
[23:29.98]I'm the guy with the really, really deep voice.
[23:32.18]The really kind of gravelly voice today.
[23:33.72]Yeah, I think I'll lean into it.
[23:40.76]Is this going to shoot me if I walk into it?
[23:45.78]Okay, that's not an alarm.
[23:47.02]That is the machine gun.
[23:48.22]Okay, so... What did I... I need to move this.
[23:52.19]How do I do that?
[23:53.27]I want to pick up the items.
[24:04.91]I can't climb in this.
[24:11.99]You live in that house.
[24:12.87]I'm back.
[24:15.34]Stop.
[24:15.68]Don't get me on that.
[24:16.96]I... That's not an HD scanner.
[24:28.92]I thought... Well, it technically is a scanner.
[24:33.60]Where does this move to?
[24:39.28]Does that really even help?
[24:40.82]But, hold on.
[24:42.22]I know, I'm collect every item guy.
[24:44.88]I'm sorry, I am.
[24:54.93]Can I not get that?
[24:55.67]I need to move this.
[24:57.73]How do I move this?
[24:58.79]There's a chest right here.
[25:01.24]Wait.
[25:03.32]I don't even need to move it.
[25:04.76]Because I just moved this, right?
[25:05.66]Okay.
[25:08.89]Oh, we're good.
[25:11.23]There we go.
[25:11.55]Alright.
[25:11.97]Got it.
[25:16.66]Go.
[25:17.08]Okay.
[25:18.94]We're good.
[25:29.91]Collect everything.
[25:30.93]Nice bangle.
[25:31.91]Yeah, it is going to be a nice bangle when I sell it for $10,000, $15,000.
[25:41.65]You still have that got it on your soundboard from the WarioWare stream.
[25:46.77]No, that's been cleared out, unfortunately.
[25:50.80]I think even SCORN is gone.
[25:54.50]Sorry.
[25:58.06]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[25:59.88]It's actually pretty screwed up.
[26:01.13]And I fucked this up again.
[26:02.43]How did I screw this up?
[26:07.85]Nah, I'm alright, right?
[26:09.51]Just have to move this.
[26:11.81]Yeah, we're good.
[26:17.32]Yeah, SCORN is gone too.
[26:18.30]I know, I screwed up.
[26:26.18]Items?
[26:29.84]I actually do have to conserve handgun ammo.
[26:32.51]So let's make this happen.
[26:37.55]Oh, come on.
[26:45.58]Really?
[26:45.88]That's annoying.
[26:50.31]What the fuck?
[26:51.09]Did he just spit at me?
[26:57.41]What happened to conserving ammo?
[26:59.28]I just used everything.
[27:15.54]Get this loaded up.
[27:20.08]How does that miss?
[27:22.78]How are these missing?
[27:29.46]Can you please lie so I can tag that guy?
[27:42.19]Shoot him!
[27:46.71]Stop shooting!
[27:47.45]Shoot him!
[27:48.87]Pick what you want to do, Jeremy!
[27:52.23]Stop shooting!
[27:52.77]Shoot him!
[27:53.11]Don't shoot!
[27:53.57]Stop shooting him!
[27:54.17]I didn't even lie.
[28:13.09]Watch out!
[28:13.89]Watch out!
[28:20.77]I shot that guy in the shoulder every single time.
[28:22.82]I got 50.
[28:28.56]Ooh, what's over there?
[28:40.45]Shit.
[28:43.15]Shit, I missed that.
[28:46.30]It's all the way back.
[28:47.80]I can't get that from here.
[28:48.58]It's all the way back.
[28:51.21]Shoot them in the kneecap.
[28:52.19]I could.
[28:55.49]Go back and get it.
[28:58.69]Is it actually a treasure treasure?
[29:00.29]It's not on the map, though.
[29:02.17]Alright, I'm doing this only once.
[29:03.27]Where the... There they are.
[29:11.64]Okay.
[29:13.46]It's a legendary treasure.
[29:14.56]I don't think it is, but I do want to go get it.
[29:19.06]How often do I trim my nails?
[29:20.47]Um...
[29:25.25]It's going to be worth like 5k.
[29:28.67]Let's just see.
[29:29.21]The thing about Resident Evil games, especially from 4 onward, is you really do want to get as many of those treasures as you can.
[29:38.20]It just makes your life so much easier later.
[29:40.98]Upgrading everything you want.
[29:42.32]Spending all the money.
[29:42.98]Here we go.
[30:03.98]Mmm, 600.
[30:04.74]And... Eh, no.
[30:07.67]It was worth it.
[30:08.05]It was worth it.
[30:12.17]Ammo I didn't have before.
[30:14.27]It was worth it.
[30:14.65]What was that?
[30:21.64]What is... What is this?
[30:29.52]Weird.
[30:29.82]Okay.
[30:33.24]Are you liking this better than Resident Evil 2?
[30:37.32]No, I think... Well, a lot of Resident Evil 2 is being chased.
[30:45.37]Which, as you know from my experience that Granny likes, I really don't like.
[30:49.53]But in Resident Evil 2, it didn't feel... I was okay with that.
[30:58.51]I thought it was fine.
[31:07.42]What's a granny like?
[31:09.23]Um... How do I explain this?
[31:13.11]Granny like is when you have to collect a bunch of items...
[31:17.64]And, okay, let me, how do I spell this out?
[31:21.38]Okay, you open, the game opens.
[31:24.24]You're in a house.
[31:25.26]You're in a, or you're in a grocery store.
[31:26.92]You're in a mall, or you're in a home.
[31:30.22]It doesn't matter where you are.
[31:32.10]And there's a piece of bubble gum sitting next to you.
[31:36.24]It's like, oh, bubble gum, you got it.
[31:37.68]Okay.
[31:39.04]And then to your left is a sink that's missing a pipe.
[31:44.80]And you don't know, you know you're gonna have to come back with a fucking pipe to put on that sink.
[31:49.78]But you don't know where the pipe is.
[31:52.52]So eventually, you end up running around, an hour or so later, 40 minutes later, you get a pipe.
[31:59.09]And then you have to go back and put the pipe on, and then use the gum to plug up the sink.
[32:03.75]And then you gotta take the thing, the key that you get out of the sink, and go put it into the floorboard, and then from the floorboard, it's just...
[32:09.91]And then all that time, all while you're doing that, somebody is chasing you.
[32:14.72]And you die if they get you.
[32:15.80]Hate it.
[32:16.92]I don't like it.
[32:18.92]I don't like those.
[32:23.62]That's a granny leg.
[32:30.94]What does it have to do with grannies?
[32:32.42]Because there's a very popular game called Granny... ...where Granny chases you around... ...and you have to fucking pick up the floorboards and put, like, gum into the sink!
[32:44.70]And find the wrench to then, like, open the fucking door to the, you know, the basement!
[32:51.00]It's Granny!
[32:54.07]I wanna kick you off here.
[32:56.27]Holy shit, that was cool.
[32:59.64]Kill this guy!
[33:08.00]Like Hello Neighbor.
[33:09.48]Yes, exactly.
[33:10.92]Is that game out of alpha yet?
[33:18.53]I have not heard about that game in like six years.
[33:24.46]I remember that game was in alpha for a long time.
[33:29.08]I was like, oh, what is this game?
[33:33.70]Is it actually still not out?
[33:35.48]No, I've seen ads for a sequel.
[33:37.86]It has to be out.
[33:46.19]That's a granny leg.
[33:48.85]It already has a sequel.
[33:51.31]Is it any good?
[34:06.57]I don't want to kill this guy because I feel... I feel like he's trying to figure a puzzle out with a crowbar.
[34:11.90]Which is exactly the kind of person that I want to make sure stays around.
[34:15.86]This guy's trying to figure this out with a crowbar and... I feel really bad about this.
[34:25.04]Oh, that's what you were doing.
[34:28.30]He made pretty good progress.
[34:29.32]That was one of the smarter of the zombies, I think.
[34:40.32]Can you have a Roblox stream?
[34:41.46]My mom really wants you to play Roblox.
[34:42.79]No, I'm not going to play Roblox.
[34:46.17]Not right now.
[34:47.77]Probably not ever.
[34:48.95]Probably never.
[34:49.75]I'm just going to tell you right now that's never going to happen.
[34:52.25]I'm literally never going to play Roblox.
[34:55.75]Not that I don't, I just, I'm not going to, right?
[34:58.99]Like, that's all I have to say.
[35:00.35]I don't need to explain why I don't really want to.
[35:02.47]I don't need to tell you the reasoning.
[35:03.94]I'm just not going to do it.
[35:05.68]And that's all that needs to be said.
[35:07.96]That's it.
[35:09.16]There's your answer.
[35:10.00]Are you going to play Roblox?
[35:10.76]No, I'm not going to play Roblox at any point.
[35:15.90]I hope you have fun in Roblox.
[35:17.62]Seems like a pretty interesting world.
[35:19.02]I'm never playing Roblox ever on this stream.
[35:23.92]Ever.
[35:24.88]You understand?
[35:25.40]It is never happening.
[35:28.96]Alright, now when, like a year from now when I do play it, you can tag that guy.
[35:39.39]Alright, did I get everything?
[35:41.67]I think I did.
[35:46.56]There's a bunch of little areas to go explore.
[35:49.01]Hold on.
[35:50.07]Is that one?
[35:50.83]Yeah, I'm going to miss something, but who cares?
[35:52.25]Alright.
[35:54.87]Hold on.
[35:55.31]Sneak.
[36:00.57]This is really good looking, though.
[36:06.11]This isn't good.
[36:15.26]Nice shot, you suck!
[36:23.99]Parry the rocket?
[36:24.89]I don't think you can, man.
[36:30.07]Suplex!
[36:37.09]That did not even come close.
[36:39.45]What's wrong with that?
[36:49.13]I have no need for this.
[36:52.95]But I guess I'll just stick it in here, right?
[36:57.66]I'm at full health, so it doesn't really matter.
[36:59.96]Can I take one more hit?
[37:01.58]I think I can.
[37:02.12]I can.
[37:06.72]I have body armor, so I definitely can take it.
[37:30.15]Don't!
[37:40.15]What is it?
[37:40.47]Dead?
[37:48.30]Dead.
[37:50.18]When are you gonna have a skincare product line come out?
[38:03.12]What the hell was that sound?
[38:05.56]Oh, it's you.
[38:09.06]Skincare product?
[38:19.61]Going up there first.
[38:26.52]Okay.
[38:35.48]We're good, right?
[38:36.72]Yeah.
[38:39.62]Treasures?
[38:40.79]Not listed.
[38:41.39]Oh, I need the map, don't I?
[38:42.39]Stop reading random-ass messages, LMAO.
[38:50.09]Yeah, but isn't that, like, kind of... What do you mean, stop reading random-ass messages?
[38:54.28]What do you mean, true?
[38:59.88]I'm streaming.
[39:00.58]I'm gonna read some of the messages that come through.
[39:19.06]I have 18 gunpowder.
[39:20.12]I need the little blue burrito, whatever it is.
[39:24.30]What the hell is this?
[39:39.09]What is this?
[39:41.84]Remember, April 5th.
[39:43.22]What's going on April 5th?
[39:52.19]April 5th, remember, remember.
[39:53.51]When are you going to play Roblox?
[40:01.07]I'll play Roblox on your birthday, okay?
[40:07.57]Next year.
[40:11.11]Oh, here's a page.
[40:12.79]So what?
[40:13.27]What do you mean?
[40:13.83]Yeah, next year.
[40:14.51]When's his... When's his birthday?
[40:23.54]This doesn't hold off in court though.
[40:26.03]I could have been talking to anybody.
[40:28.15]I didn't know when your birthday was.
[40:29.19]Could have been anybody's birthday.
[40:37.57]There's a paper trail on this.
[40:39.33]I'm not playing Roblox like next week.
[40:45.23]I'm telling you that's not happening.
[40:56.60]What if I watch a Roblox video or something?
[41:00.10]Is that sufficient for you?
[41:08.56]No, I'm not playing Roblox.
[41:12.41]I'm not playing it.
[41:13.69]When I said next year, what I meant to say was I'll play Roblox on your birthday.
[41:23.29]God damn it.
[41:26.75]Why does everybody have receipts?
[41:28.13]Like, why do you have receipts on this stream?
[41:30.21]You know what I'm saying?
[41:30.92]Like, come on.
[41:32.08]Why do you have receipts?
[41:33.32]I'm getting red receipts right now.
[41:43.22]I never said I was gonna... Alright, when I say play Roblox, if I open up the main menu, go like this, do my options, and then leave the game.
[41:52.27]It counts.
[41:52.93]I opened it.
[41:59.96]I'm trying to shoot the thing.
[42:06.41]Oh my god!
[42:07.05]I'm alive.
[42:37.92]okay stab you have to play roblox for 30 consecutive minutes that's not part of the deal I did I just said I was going to play it on your birthday and I don't even know whose birthday I was talking about it was misleading info misleading the witness leading you late are you leading
[43:07.41]I hear one of those bobbleheads.
[43:10.13]Overruled.
[43:11.65]Objection, Your Honor.
[43:15.39]The witness, me, did not know that person's birthday.
[43:19.49]And I agreed to something that wasn't in writing and there was no contract.
[43:22.73]There was no verbal contract either because I didn't know exactly when the date was.
[43:25.51]I was never told that, Your Honor.
[43:28.43]So, objection has been sustained.
[43:30.80]Thank you.
[43:40.54]Where is this thing?
[43:46.34]I can hear it.
[43:46.86]Where is it?
[43:54.17]Where is this thing?
[44:03.79]Where is it?
[44:19.69]Where is this thing?
[44:21.97]Left?
[44:29.76]It's above you?
[44:30.36]I don't care.
[44:49.28]Doesn't matter.
[44:49.62]Alright, this is a treasure I gotta get.
[44:52.58]Somebody said I missed a treasure with a barrel or something.
[44:59.57]I told my mother you were going to play Roblox.
[45:00.95]I don't want to play Roblox.
[45:03.65]I'm not doing it.
[45:05.59]I'm not doing it.
[45:07.44]It's really far back.
[45:09.02]Is it really?
[45:11.94]No, it's not, is it?
[45:20.37]This is a shortcut anyways, isn't it?
[45:26.60]No, it's not.
[45:28.30]Nah, alright, I'm going.
[45:29.22]Uh, but yeah.
[45:41.15]Alright, how about this?
[45:42.93]We'll take a deal here.
[45:44.53]On your birthday, I will sing you a Roblox-themed happy birthday.
[45:48.16]We'll have a Roblox-themed birthday party for you.
[45:50.94]Right?
[45:51.10]Like, I'll get Roblox plates and cups and, like, a Roblox thing that hangs with balloons.
[45:57.34]And then I'm not even gonna play the fucking game.
[46:00.41]That's a Roblox-themed birthday party.
[46:02.39]That doesn't mean I'm gonna have to play it.
[46:10.52]Do you accept my plea?
[46:11.76]My, uh, my, the deal here?
[46:17.04]You know what the best part about this?
[46:18.00]I don't even know who this person is.
[46:19.34]I have no idea who this is.
[46:22.49]But we're gonna have a birthday party for you.
[46:24.95]Okay.
[46:29.01]I fucking heard it too.
[46:30.45]And I just kept going.
[46:40.25]It's a binding.
[46:40.89]Was that actually April 5th, though?
[46:42.41]I don't want to do this.
[46:43.33]Actually, it's kind of funny.
[46:46.23]Ooh, nice.
[46:52.76]Why are you scared of Roblox?
[46:55.02]I'm not scared of Roblox.
[46:56.36]I just don't.
[46:58.14]Just like I could tell you like five things that I really just don't think I want to do In the next few months and one of them is play roblox I just don't this just doesn't do anything for me and I don't really want to like it's just like why why would I?
[47:10.74]I just don't want to play the game roblox You probably love it, but that's alright this person's gonna get killed by this No you come to me
[47:28.08]You come to me.
[47:35.54]He was like, no, you come over here.
[47:48.48]There was something else down there.
[47:50.26]This is game progress.
[47:51.00]I don't want to do that yet.
[47:59.79]This is ultimate game progress, so never mind.
[48:02.17]Okay.
[48:07.17]I'm supposed to check in to make sure they didn't go anywhere.
[48:14.04]Have you ever been to Five Nights at Freddy's?
[48:16.32]The movie?
[48:19.72]What?
[48:26.90]You heard it here.
[48:27.48]He's afraid of Roblox.
[48:32.38]That's fine.
[48:34.42]Just wait till our Roblox-themed birthday party.
[48:40.67]You know what?
[48:41.03]I actually probably would rather play the game now that I think about it because then there'll be images of me on the internet wearing like a Roblox party hat and like eating cake off of a Roblox paper plate at 40.
[48:51.29]And I don't know if I really want those images to be available to, you know, I don't think I want those images to be available.
[49:14.42]Okay.
[49:16.02]Anything else in here?
[49:17.06]Nope.
[49:19.82]This is the worst part of the game coming up.
[49:22.82]This is the worst part of the game.
[49:26.38]I got through my one out of two of my least favorite scary I hate being in this zone areas.
[49:33.95]Now we have to do the other one.
[49:36.81]I really don't want to.
[49:39.07]I love this game.
[49:39.71]I'm going to do it.
[49:40.91]It's coming up here soon.
[49:46.83]My mom's grounding me and taking away my phone.
[49:53.69]Good.
[49:55.35]Good.
[49:56.90]Get off that thing.
[49:59.60]Don't use that fucking thing.
[50:10.25]Boomer.
[50:11.79]Put that thing down.
[50:13.91]Put that thing down.
[50:21.43]Why is he so mean tonight?
[50:26.43]Can I get an instant kill on the big guy?
[50:34.33]Maybe I would have if I did it at the right time.
[50:37.17]Okay.
[50:39.31]I don't want to use it.
[50:40.29]I'm not going to use it.
[50:40.85]I'm going to go on.
[50:41.54]I'm going to... What are you doing?
[51:02.42]Got him.
[51:03.24]Alright.
[51:04.00]Those guys are not as bad now with all the power I have.
[51:08.34]You look decrepit tonight.
[51:19.16]Somebody wants a birthday party on the 5th.
[51:22.94]You want a birthday party though, right?
[51:26.98]Where's my birthday party?
[51:28.52]I want a Roblox themed birthday party.
[51:31.16]You're ugly!
[51:33.55]Spoiled.
[51:34.66]Spoiled.
[51:35.34]Spoiled.
[51:37.00]Hmm.
[51:39.98]Hmm.
[51:47.29]Hmm.
[51:51.93]I need a card reader.
[51:59.03]Any trinkets?
[52:13.20]I'm looking for trinkets.
[52:13.88]Why are you being so scary?
[52:19.17]What are you talking about?
[52:28.75]You actually blocked it with the axe.
[52:34.76]Not bad, right?
[52:43.44]Come on, go down.
[52:44.58]Down!
[52:57.41]Pretty good.
[53:03.85]Suplex.
[53:11.30]Actually, really, really glad I got those.
[53:12.84]Okay, cool.
[53:13.64]I'm never there.
[53:26.95]I asked you if you visited the movie set of Five Nights at Freddy's.
[53:30.83]No, I have not visited the movie set.
[53:34.61]Why would I be on the movie set of Five Nights at Freddy's?
[53:46.82]You can't lie your way out of this one.
[53:48.36]The great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
[53:49.90]You said on January 4th.
[53:54.52]Yeah, speaking of attorneys, look at all these attorneys in chat.
[53:58.68]On January 4th, 2023, precisely 5 p.m., you stated on your live stream in front of 12,000 witnesses that you were going to play Ace Attorney at exactly 6 p.m.
[54:14.03]I am going to play that.
[54:15.63]I'll play Ace Attorney.
[54:21.25]Well, I will.
[54:25.45]I never said I wasn't going to play Ace Attorney.
[54:27.21]I just said I wasn't going to play it right now.
[54:30.00]Play it eventually.
[54:34.30]That's going to be a good chill stream, I think.
[54:35.80]Look at those reflexes.
[54:43.24]Finger was in nose.
[54:45.97]Left hand was off keyboard.
[54:47.07]Picking nose.
[54:48.57]Looking over here, talking to you.
[54:50.27]And I got that guy in the fucking head.
[54:52.51]Right when he jumped out.
[54:53.07]I don't want to hear it anymore.
[54:55.66]Look at how slow this guy is in games.
[54:58.34]I don't want to hear it anymore.
[54:59.52]I don't want to hear it.
[55:00.66]I am mean today.
[55:04.38]I'm like mean right now.
[55:10.29]Ooh.
[55:11.15]It's full heal.
[55:15.80]Another crown.
[55:16.80]I'm close to doing another 100k.
[55:18.54]I need... What do I need?
[55:19.82]I need a red.
[55:20.96]Yeah, I'm close to getting another 100k.
[55:49.85]Let's go.
[55:50.27]Oh, you have resources.
[55:51.39]Good.
[55:51.61]I need these.
[55:52.29]I really need those.
[56:21.47]Yes!
[56:21.89]Alright, I got eight for that.
[56:28.79]Good.
[56:30.57]Alright, 40.
[56:34.23]I got 42 in here now.
[56:37.57]The next revolver is coming up.
[56:38.57]Why do you keep upgrading that one?
[56:40.24]Because that one with the exclusive upgrade does the most damage of all the revolvers, doesn't it?
[56:50.05]Hmm.
[56:52.01]I need more of these.
[56:54.13]Where is the... Ooh, chicken egg.
[57:01.84]Not off the killer seven crits.
[57:04.22]True, but... How many times do I have to shoot to reliably get a crit?
[57:10.16]I wonder.
[57:11.38]Like, what's the percentage chance?
[57:12.52]I wonder.
[57:16.54]Change the outfit?
[57:17.81]Actually, that's a good point.
[57:18.53]Yeah, we can go back to the default now.
[57:20.09]The end of the game.
[57:21.79]We'll go back to the original.
[57:22.89]It's been, like, 15 in-game hours or something since I had the original outfit on.
[57:28.45]I changed that within, like, the first two or three hours, didn't I?
[57:30.27]Yeah, I'll put it back.
[57:35.25]Vote for the final outfit?
[57:36.93]Now, that's fair.
[57:38.47]That's fair.
[57:39.75]Alright, we're gonna start with, um... Let's start with Leon.
[57:42.48]Final outfit, I'm not changing it.
[57:47.77]Leon, I am going to veto one of these because there's only room for four slots.
[57:54.80]So I am vetoing.
[58:15.40]I'm vetoing hero.
[58:17.74]This was funny for a minute, but I'm vetoing hero.
[58:20.78]Your choices are default, villain, casual, or romantic.
[58:28.02]Romantic, casual, hero.
[58:30.22]No.
[58:30.60]Romantic, casual, villain, or default.
[58:32.96]Default.
[58:34.79]Villain.
[58:36.99]Casual.
[58:38.32]Romantic.
[58:39.70]This is it.
[58:40.04]I'm not changing this for the rest of the game.
[58:42.42]You guys get to decide.
[58:43.08]And I know a lot of people are going to be mad at this.
[58:44.40]Because you're probably picking the... Wow.
[58:47.92]Actually, never mind.
[58:48.48]I'm not going to say anything.
[58:49.14]Damn.
[58:56.54]Jeez.
[58:56.78]Okay.
[58:57.08]I'm not going to say anything.
[58:59.28]I don't want to influence the vote.
[59:04.11]There are actually five options for polls.
[59:06.25]Yeah, but I don't want to weigh this one anymore.
[59:07.77]It's all good.
[59:13.31]It's close, but I don't think it's close enough.
[59:15.83]It's close, but not really.
[59:20.13]You got like five seconds before we were just going to do what we were going to do.
[59:29.02]46% to 41% default versus romantic.
[59:30.92]You have literally three seconds.
[59:35.75]Default wins.
[59:37.01]Thanks for playing.
[59:39.37]Alright.
[59:39.97]Next, very important.
[59:42.05]Sunglasses on or off?
[59:45.70]Sunglasses on or off for the final arc of the rest of the game?
[59:48.04]On or off?
[59:48.94]Sunglasses on or off?
[59:56.53]It's very important.
[60:01.76]Plus, you know, this gives me a few minutes to take a sip of my drink and apply some lip balm.
[60:09.72]Sunglasses on or off?
[60:18.62]Still close.
[60:22.39]Very close.
[60:24.81]Wow, the people want default.
[60:26.47]Default.
[60:27.19]Everything default.
[60:28.39]Interesting.
[60:30.64]I guess it makes sense.
[60:31.82]There's only so much, I guess, of the comedy outfits, if you really want to see kind of how it plays out in the end of the game.
[60:40.64]Yeah, sunglasses off has kind of run away with it here.
[60:46.48]I don't think it's possible.
[60:48.34]Almost 60% of the vote is for off.
[60:52.40]Sorry, everybody.
[60:53.56]Well, I apologize.
[60:55.36]A majority of you, or at least a larger percentage of you, want me to turn it off.
[61:00.47]Alright, we're going default.
[61:02.47]Now, we have only two more things to care about.
[61:06.12]Ashley's costume for the rest of the game.
[61:08.24]Default, casual, or romantic.
[61:13.84]Only three options here.
[61:15.50]Default.
[61:17.78]Stay with casual.
[61:19.28]Change back to romantic.
[61:23.02]Make your choice.
[61:31.67]Romantic.
[61:33.35]Casual.
[61:33.73]Default.
[61:41.55]This is very split.
[61:53.09]Everyone has poor taste.
[61:55.45]Well, here's the thing.
[61:58.32]It's spread out pretty evenly.
[62:00.06]So you all, you all disagree evenly.
[62:05.60]It's like 40%, 20%, 37%.
[62:06.28]You guys seem to be equally in disagreement.
[62:07.96]So it's going to be close.
[62:08.98]Alright.
[62:29.49]That's it.
[62:30.81]Default.
[62:32.05]Alright.
[62:32.55]The final decision you have to make is Ashley's accessories.
[62:37.25]Default is sweeping, by the way.
[62:38.89]I'm just telling you.
[62:40.77]No accessories.
[62:41.91]Just default, classic, nothing.
[62:44.45]Red hair, the Wellington glasses, or the mask?
[62:50.32]Just go full on nothing.
[62:51.96]Just classic.
[62:53.82]Red hair, glasses, or mask?
[63:02.35]This one I'm actually interested in.
[63:07.09]Wow.
[63:08.71]Default sweep.
[63:10.42]Not even close.
[63:11.74]Actually, wait a minute.
[63:12.68]It is close.
[63:13.68]It is close.
[63:14.18]Hold on.
[63:14.50]It's close.
[63:16.90]Red hair is really starting to come up here.
[63:19.34]This is too close to call now.
[63:20.34]Uh-oh.
[63:23.51]Default has lost the race so far.
[63:27.97]Default is losing.
[63:30.08]Default is losing.
[63:31.38]I would click on that button if you don't want to look at the thing you didn't want to see.
[63:35.86]I think red hair is... No?
[63:40.31]Hold on.
[63:40.57]You got like 10 seconds.
[63:49.01]Stop influencing.
[63:50.49]I saw what was happening, so I started saying both of them.
[63:52.87]Default looks pretty cool.
[63:54.23]Red hair looks pretty cool, right?
[63:55.53]Doesn't it?
[63:56.27]Which one?
[63:57.26]Either one.
[63:57.56]I don't know.
[64:01.27]Only won by about 100 votes.
[64:03.87]Red hair it is.
[64:04.31]And we're not doing the filters.
[64:07.45]I'm not playing with those on.
[64:09.67]There you go.
[64:10.53]Default everything, but Ashley has red hair now, I guess.
[64:12.99]Okay, let's go.
[64:26.78]Wait, what is this?
[64:30.68]Leatherjacket has contributed 550,000 channel points to that.
[64:36.50]Wait, what?
[64:38.99]What does that mean?
[64:39.97]What does that mean?
[64:43.55]We enabled channel points to vote more.
[64:46.97]Oh, you can actually spend money to... Spend channel money to vote.
[64:52.69]I wanted default.
[64:55.89]Hey, come on.
[65:02.03]Alright, we're good.
[65:03.37]I'm going to eat this egg.
[65:12.47]It's rigged.
[65:15.53]We're not going back.
[65:16.90]Alright, let's go.
[65:18.14]Wait.
[65:19.30]Chester, trust right here.
[65:21.86]There's another one in the other room.
[65:26.14]What do you mean rigged?
[65:31.74]We're getting to the scary part of the game and I need to focus because this is scary.
[65:34.80]I don't have the key card.
[65:53.59]How's the audio?
[65:54.31]We good?
[66:07.16]I'm gonna go this way first.
[66:08.02]Okay, I need a key card.
[66:27.35]Okay.
[66:36.20]Oh my god.
[66:37.12]I hate these things.
[66:42.53]I don't hear it yet.
[67:26.64]They do it.
[67:31.36]Oh, they do it.
[67:32.04]They do it.
[67:32.78]They do it in the remake too.
[67:37.16]Oh, I fucking hate it.
[67:38.67]I hate it.
[67:43.75]That.
[67:45.31]That.
[67:47.79]Oh, shut up.
[67:48.83]Okay.
[67:55.90]Dissection.
[67:58.80]Override card for level 2 clearance using the machine in the freezer.
[68:01.57]So I have to go to the dissection, come to the freezer, scan it, and then... Somebody help me.
[68:24.36]Now we gotta go up here.
[68:38.65]Wait.
[68:39.35]I am fucked here.
[68:41.87]I'm just realizing right now.
[68:44.30]I'm realizing right now what's going on.
[68:45.60]Those of you that played the game before, how am I gonna do this?
[68:51.90]I fucked everything up big time.
[68:55.15]Oh, this is a disaster, actually.
[68:56.85]How am I going to reliably do this?
[69:02.86]Honestly, this is going to be my solution.
[69:08.67]It's going to have to be.
[69:09.43]I don't have a rifle.
[69:11.03]It's going to have to be this.
[69:12.99]You know what I'm talking about.
[69:31.50]What do I have to do here?
[69:40.62]There we go.
[69:46.34]Is that on, right?
[69:51.01]That's on, right?
[69:51.57]Oh, I gotta power both of them.
[69:57.69]Shit, okay.
[70:06.63]I fucking hate using A and D. I just want to use up or like W or use the mouse scroll.
[70:14.28]That's it, right?
[70:18.16]I got both of them on.
[70:19.14]How do I?
[70:19.74]Yeah, two to two.
[70:20.24]That's it, right?
[70:20.56]Do I have to like activate it?
[70:30.63]Confirm it.
[70:33.47]Oh, okay.
[70:37.49]System restored.
[70:38.49]I am so screwed.
[70:54.69]At last I have created a new life.
[70:56.23]I call it the Regenerator.
[71:00.23]Its metabolic capacity is incredible.
[71:02.27]Unless all the parasites residing within the organism are destroyed, its tissue can regenerate indefinitely.
[71:11.70]Upon examining the body with a biosensor scope, I was able to confirm that the parasites behave like vital organs for the host, almost as though it has multiple hearts.
[71:22.56]This new creation of mine is essentially immortal.
[71:25.84]Surely, even Dr. Frankenstein himself would want to shake my hand in admiration.
[71:31.91]And then it fucking killed him.
[71:43.06]So, for those of you that don't know, I'm just gonna, I know it's a spoiler, but I know the spoiler, so I'm just gonna tell you what it is.
[71:51.36]I can't see through their bodies, and you normally can if you get this scope to do it, and I'm not gonna be able to because I don't have a rifle.
[72:00.77]I'm in trouble.
[72:10.00]Or am I?
[72:13.37]Or am I actually in trouble?
[72:15.57]I was checking to- I know!
[72:45.22]What's wrong with this?
[72:49.96]Oh my god.
[72:51.94]Oh my god, dude.
[72:53.28]That was the worst fucking scare I think I had in like a year.
[72:55.98]And I like knew it was gonna happen too.
[72:57.46]That fucked up my whole brain.
[72:59.16]Oh my god, that was bad.
[73:01.12]Wow, why was it that one?
[73:03.85]Why was it?
[73:04.29]I knew he was coming, but I thought he was slower than that.
[73:09.71]I thought it was much slower than that.
[73:11.21]It was the fact there was a lot of things going on there.
[73:13.79]First of all, I thought I had the keycard and I was going to swipe it, but I didn't.
[73:17.76]I don't have the keycard.
[73:18.86]And then I looked down the hallway.
[73:20.42]He wasn't there.
[73:20.96]Nice fake YouTube jump scare.
[73:26.04]It wasn't.
[73:26.97]It was real.
[73:28.79]But a lot of factors there.
[73:30.19]There really were a lot of factors on that.
[73:33.07]I looked down the hallway and there was nothing there.
[73:35.29]And then I turned around.
[73:36.39]There was immediately somebody right there.
[73:39.34]This doesn't have power either.
[73:40.32]What actually does have power right now?
[73:44.67]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[73:45.93]I'm going to have to... You can't come in here.
[73:57.20]But where is he?
[74:06.38]I can't go in the freezer.
[74:07.44]I can't go in here.
[74:09.61]So I need to go down here.
[74:10.83]Okay, so I gotta go left, right, right.
[74:17.73]Buy a rifle right now?
[74:20.25]Let me see that scare.
[74:20.95]I want to see how embarrassing it was.
[74:23.54]I mean, it was probably really embarrassing.
[74:32.24]What's wrong with this?
[74:39.34]really does look like a youtube thumbnail it's he's grab he's got his hands locked around my head and it's me screaming my limiter my limiter on my microphone was working overtime on that one by the way stranger welcome well what can I do you for
[75:10.66]He doesn't sell it, does he?
[75:13.28]I thought he sold it.
[75:14.23]Go get the SMG in the freezer.
[75:25.31]Oh, shit.
[75:26.25]No, you're right.
[75:26.75]Okay, okay.
[75:27.39]I thought I was screwed for a second.
[75:29.45]Alright.
[75:31.61]I'm gonna heal full health with the bass and just run.
[75:35.58]Oh, I need to do this.
[75:54.66]It was so loud.
[75:56.48]I just... Whatever.
[75:57.50]I don't think any of this really matters right now.
[76:09.26]I guess I'll put on the... This.
[76:20.41]Get the rifle.
[76:20.81]I don't have enough money for the rifle.
[76:24.53]I'll be alright.
[76:25.29]I just have to... I just have to get to where I need to go.
[76:27.92]And I'm just gonna run.
[76:29.00]I'm gonna save it right here.
[76:29.82]I knew I was gonna hate this part.
[76:33.60]It's just me remembering how much I hated this when I was younger.
[76:40.47]Okay.
[76:42.07]It's left, right, right.
[76:44.93]Go.
[77:27.88]Okay, left and then straight across.
[78:07.84]There's more than one.
[78:08.70]Oh, and I have two to deal with.
[78:10.90]I have to deal with this now.
[78:12.92]I have to deal with this.
[78:20.77]Did I get them all?
[78:23.23]I got them all.
[78:25.87]I got them all.
[78:58.70]28 slugs Steven.
[79:01.60]It was worth it.
[79:02.64]I got rid of all the parasites.
[79:05.19]That's going to have to be the play if I don't get the scope.
[79:09.61]There's another one just hanging out here.
[79:10.76]Okay.
[79:18.84]I got three to power.
[79:30.69]Shit, come on.
[79:36.55]Come on.
[79:37.07]I gotta get that last one.
[80:03.07]There it is.
[80:08.53]Oh boy, I got it.
[80:09.53]Ooh, an LE-5.
[80:18.21]There it is.
[80:28.41]And I can put the scope on this.
[80:32.39]Where do I get that scope though?
[80:37.22]I don't know where I get the scope.
[80:45.75]So you get it later.
[80:46.45]Okay, so now I gotta go.
[80:48.19]I have level two.
[80:52.07]So level two gets me to the down here.
[80:55.03]So I need to power this back up over here.
[80:58.89]Go back to this room.
[81:00.88]Switch it back to here and then go here.
[81:02.38]Alright, so I don't want to fight this thing.
[81:05.10]So I'm going to go straight left straight.
[81:08.78]Maybe I should just kill it.
[81:10.56]I'm just going to kill it.
[81:12.94]I've got my... I'm going for it again.
[81:36.26]got it thank god okay alright alright I don't I'm good I I ran out of bullets but that's alright that's exactly why I wanted to have that weapon that weapon is is precisely what I wanted to do with it okay so now I gotta go back around here
[82:06.14]Power this.
[82:09.70]Another one's probably going to spawn.
[82:16.31]Now I got to go back around here and then that is the end of that.
[82:38.37]Okay, this is it.
[82:42.47]Can I... Can I have an egg?
[82:43.93]Can I have an egg, please?
[82:46.53]Just give me one egg.
[82:47.21]That's all I want.
[82:54.77]What the fuck is going on?
[82:58.51]Wait, what?
[83:00.85]Wasn't this powering over here and I switched it to be powering over here now?
[83:06.84]It was already... Oh, I thought I had to put a... I thought the power was this.
[83:10.58]And then the second power was over here.
[83:13.80]Oh, shit.
[83:14.20]I turned it off.
[83:14.78]I thought it was... I thought it was... Whatever.
[83:28.79]No eggs?
[83:29.21]Okay, alright.
[83:32.45]Yeah, that's... Look at the map, though.
[83:34.41]Doesn't it look like it's...
[83:38.63]Yeah, like this is now powered down.
[83:41.35]Oh, no, it's not.
[83:44.41]Shit.
[83:49.43]Okay.
[83:54.85]Okay.
[83:58.76]Something's going to jump scare me.
[83:59.66]It's going to be another one and I have to be ready.
[84:01.08]And I can't use all of my shotgun bullets.
[84:03.62]Going to the freezer again.
[84:18.94]Just wait, here comes something.
[84:23.20]Right?
[84:26.95]Didn't hear it.
[84:32.45]I thought they were talking.
[84:56.21]Where are they?
[84:56.73]Oh.
[84:59.35]Alright, come on up here.
[85:31.32]Why is it making that weird, like, Venga, uh, voice sound?
[85:44.83]Why is it doing that?
[85:52.26]Don't play Resident Evil 4 at 3 AM.
[85:53.96]Those fucking thumbnails, man.
[86:06.00]We like to party.
[86:07.92]We like, we like to party.
[86:09.22]We like to party.
[86:16.98]That used to just absolutely amp everybody up big time when that song would play.
[86:22.30]Those of you that were around and that song was really popular, you would hear that and it would be like, holy shit, it's about to get real.
[86:30.29]It's going to be an incredibly fun party right now.
[86:36.47]In mere moments, everyone's gonna have a great time.
[86:39.67]In moments.
[86:40.71]Moments from now.
[86:50.54]Back there in, like, a wedding?
[86:52.58]Grandma and Grandpa get up for that one, too.
[86:56.26]You know, Grandma and Grandpa kind of sitting there, you know, chilling out for most of the wedding, and then all of a sudden... And it's like, okay, let's...
[87:06.08]I'm getting up for this round!
[87:07.51]And the grandma gets up, grandpa gets up, the whole family gets up.
[87:10.45]Every friend gets up.
[87:11.89]There's nobody sitting down when that song is played.
[87:16.93]They all do the same, like... Just gotta, like, fist up, like, let's go.
[87:33.18]I'm looking forward to being that guy.
[87:39.20]Okay, let's keep playing.
[87:47.15]What?
[87:58.98]Shit.
[87:59.40]Okay, they're all gonna break out of here, so I am not fighting any more of these.
[88:44.26]What's this herb?
[88:56.28]What's my favorite color?
[88:57.24]Uh, teal.
[89:00.82]During a recent power outage, a test subject awoke from cryogenic status, broke out of his holding tank, and escaped.
[89:10.01]The subject was contained after 20 hours, leaving seven dead and 19 wounded.
[89:14.83]We were unable to recover one of the bodies and a tool from inside of it.
[89:19.27]The cause of this unfortunate incident is the unstable power supply.
[89:23.02]The outdated generators cannot keep up with our demanding schedule.
[89:26.92]Management must prioritize the needs of the engineers over those of the researchers to prevent something that's ever happening again.
[89:37.24]Thank God.
[89:42.51]Thank God.
[89:46.79]Because now I can actually do this correctly.
[89:50.49]You see what's going on here?
[89:55.56]You don't know where they are in the body.
[89:58.10]That's why I was shooting everywhere with the shotgun.
[90:00.74]If these are not all destroyed at the same time, within a second or two of each other, they don't die.
[90:17.28]Alright.
[90:18.48]Should I kill them?
[90:19.20]Can I kill them now?
[90:21.54]When they're inside of this?
[90:25.08]Or no?
[90:27.33]I feel like I probably should do it.
[90:28.59]I'm gonna do it.
[90:30.49]Shit.
[90:38.19]This thing sucks.
[90:38.99]It has no power.
[91:06.96]This thing sucks.
[91:07.60]This thing doesn't hurt anything.
[91:09.88]I have to go like... To do one.
[91:12.42]I only have 30 bullets.
[91:14.86]What am I doing?
[91:15.44]What's your opinion on cheese?
[91:20.40]Alright, well, I got another... Yeah, I am pulling this person right now.
[91:30.53]Where?
[91:30.91]Okay, so all of your... They're all in like this midsection area.
[91:35.35]Okay, I got it.
[91:35.87]Ready?
[91:45.13]Whoa!
[91:45.37]Did I get them all?
[91:54.32]I didn't get them all.
[91:55.30]Oh my god.
[92:08.96]That's it.
[92:11.34]That's it.
[92:11.66]Okay.
[92:14.26]You missed both of them.
[92:15.10]I don't know how I did that.
[92:17.98]Oh.
[92:21.09]I hate this area so much.
[92:22.83]I just get so panicky and so high strung.
[92:28.57]What's going on?
[92:29.01]Oh, it's blocked.
[92:30.73]How do I unblock it?
[92:35.09]Why is it blocked up?
[92:47.88]That shit's all blocked up.
[92:52.88]Over here?
[93:09.82]Why can't I use this?
[93:13.13]It's all blocked off.
[93:14.03]I need to, like, power it on.
[93:15.43]Alright.
[93:15.85]There's the terminal.
[93:18.79]Keycard lock?
[93:21.69]Down here, maybe?
[93:22.37]You only need to kill one of them.
[93:28.30]Read the note.
[93:31.72]Wait, what?
[93:47.13]So what?
[93:48.21]The tool.
[93:50.41]So what though?
[93:52.15]We're good?
[93:56.07]Tool.
[93:58.64]Wait, what?
[93:59.84]What's going on?
[94:05.46]This is the tool.
[94:07.44]Grab the tool.
[94:10.74]What tool?
[94:13.54]They both died right here.
[94:14.62]There's nothing on the ground.
[94:20.57]Inside the enemy.
[94:21.39]There's nothing on the ground.
[94:26.67]There are more.
[94:28.41]Oh, there are more.
[94:29.25]Oh, there are more.
[94:32.99]Oh, no, there are more.
[94:36.72]And there's the tool.
[94:38.04]There's the wrench that's inside of the person's stomach.
[94:48.70]I've been looking at it like this.
[94:51.84]And there are two more, and you... I am in a lot of trouble, but you know what?
[94:58.53]Let's make this happen correctly.
[95:00.01]No excuses.
[95:01.81]Do it.
[95:02.11]I got scared.
[95:04.91]I got scared and had to run.
[95:13.92]This weapon sucks, dude!
[95:51.17]I wanna fucking quit the game.
[95:52.07]I wanna restart so bad.
[96:04.48]Fuck you!
[96:20.52]What do you mean, stop pretending?
[96:21.48]Guys, I can't, I don't know where they are, and I'm, I didn't buy a, I didn't buy a rifle so these bullets don't fucking hurt anything.
[96:31.91]So I have to see where the parasites are and then switch to a different weapon.
[96:38.41]I'm good.
[96:40.71]I got the tool, I'm good.
[96:43.91]There's something in here.
[96:50.68]You have no ammo?
[96:51.60]I'll be good.
[96:52.82]Don't worry, I'll be fine.
[96:58.12]It could go worse the next time.
[97:01.95]Where is this thing?
[97:02.65]It's like hanging right here.
[97:06.77]I'll be good.
[97:08.29]Trust me, I'll be good.
[97:15.73]Oh, by the way, it turns out that everyone telling me that the Deluxe Edition had cheating maps was a liar.
[97:21.91]Because that's not real.
[97:23.67]You guys just made that up.
[97:28.07]So that's why I have not been buying the treasure maps.
[97:32.77]Because everyone told me I was a cheater and I bought the deluxe edition.
[97:35.86]Which gave me access to all the treasures.
[97:38.00]And everyone was like, oh, he's a cheater.
[97:39.24]And I was like, oh, I don't have to buy those.
[97:40.72]Turns out that's not real.
[97:42.84]That's not accurate.
[97:46.22]Thank you for that one.
[97:46.88]Alright.
[97:48.66]I got the tool.
[97:57.03]I got the treasure.
[98:00.51]You only had to kill one of these things.
[98:02.97]Yeah, but I was scared that they were going to all break out and it was going to open up and kill me.
[98:06.78]It was just for the first area.
[98:14.90]Yeah.
[98:23.71]I have to do this right.
[98:25.65]So bear with me here.
[98:29.62]This guy will do it for me.
[98:30.40]That guy hit me right in the fucking head.
[98:34.10]How did they perfectly do that?
[98:37.22]That is so annoying right now.
[98:39.81]How did they do that so flawlessly?
[98:42.03]Okay, that's what I wanted to do.
[98:49.87]Oh my god, I broke one out with the grenade.
[98:52.11]Oh no, that's not good.
[98:54.74]That's very bad.
[98:57.22]That is exceptionally bad.
[99:00.55]I have to kill this thing right now.
[99:03.63]It's dead.
[99:04.63]Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.
[99:08.27]Oh no.
[99:09.31]Oh no.
[99:11.91]Oh no.
[99:13.69]Oh no.
[99:15.20]Wait, I can do, I can.
[99:19.60]I have an idea.
[99:25.40]Stop it.
[99:26.02]I'm dead.
[99:57.24]Throw it at me.
[99:57.72]Throw it!
[99:58.14]Dude, throw that at me already.
[100:01.65]Thank you.
[100:02.25]Jesus.
[100:02.71]This is a fucking disaster, dude.
[100:08.75]I really should just die.
[100:10.43]I should just die.
[100:11.13]This is a disaster.
[100:13.65]This is a fucking disaster.
[100:20.00]Just kill me.
[100:20.48]This is a disaster.
[100:23.19]I have no bullets.
[100:24.81]I opened up all four of those chambers.
[100:27.73]This is an absolute fucking disaster.
[100:29.75]Okay.
[100:34.72]You could leave?
[100:35.26]Yeah, but I used all my ammo.
[100:37.56]I just have to kill the one... Where am I?
[100:43.42]Alright, okay.
[100:44.11]We're good.
[100:44.61]Everybody relax.
[100:45.43]Everything is now situated.
[100:47.27]I don't have to waste...
[100:49.59]Like 200 rounds trying to shoot the stupid fucking parasites in their bellies.
[101:02.32]Okay, here we go.
[101:16.81]There's ammo somewhere, isn't there?
[101:18.68]I know I picked it up.
[101:19.40]Where is it?
[101:23.66]Okay.
[101:24.22]I just have to get this right.
[101:26.26]I have to... With the 20 shots and this weapon that has no upgrades in it... I have to get... I have to kill this one person.
[101:36.09]And then I'm going to run out of this room.
[101:45.96]Okay.
[101:46.86]Are we ready?
[101:48.33]No more messing around.
[101:49.15]No more bullshit.
[101:51.35]I'm doing this now.
[101:53.31]Can you play the song?
[101:54.43]Sure.
[101:54.63]I just typed in Vengaboys song.
[102:07.72]It's probably going to be the first one.
[102:11.64]Yeah, it is.
[102:12.16]Alright.
[102:12.56]I'm going to turn it down just a little bit.
[102:25.05]I'll activate the encounter and go.
[102:31.94]Oh!
[102:32.16]Here comes Grandma!
[102:39.34]I don't- Why am I doing this?
[102:40.42]Alright, here we go.
[102:44.39]It's time to go.
[103:38.13]Oh shit
[104:01.96]What happened?
[104:05.52]Why is this to the beat of the song?
[104:07.20]What are you doing?
[104:24.57]Who's got me?
[104:25.55]Let go of me!
[104:52.44]The song didn't help it made everything worse
[105:12.81]You know what?
[105:13.19]Fuck it.
[105:13.59]I got an idea.
[105:15.23]I'm just going to cause mayhem right now.
[105:19.43]I'm going full mayhem mode.
[105:22.32]Now, wait.
[105:22.78]Maybe Crazy Frog will help.
[105:26.36]Not a bad idea.
[105:27.72]Not a bad idea.
[105:28.26]Crazy Frog could help.
[105:30.86]It's not a bad option here.
[105:54.74]Ding ding ding
[106:25.14]No!
[106:25.48]I didn't want to shoot this!
[106:27.12]This is not the handgun!
[106:28.16]No!
[106:29.90]How do I put this down?
[106:33.36]Why is this even on the bar right now?
[106:34.97]Why is this on the bar?
[106:37.81]I'm fucking pissed now.
[107:07.18]Eat shit everybody Where's the key?
[107:48.48]I don't care anymore.
[107:49.10]We're doing fucking relaxing music.
[107:57.95]Light peanut butter jelly.
[107:59.01]Oh, that's a good one too.
[108:00.03]That's right.
[108:04.57]I will beat it to one of these songs, I promise.
[108:14.14]Alright, peanut butter jelly song.
[108:15.62]Is this?
[108:17.23]Alright.
[108:19.67]This isn't, I don't think this is it.
[108:22.80]This is not the peanut butter jelly song.
[108:26.76]But it's gonna stay!
[108:27.78]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly!
[108:32.04]This is not right!
[108:33.36]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly!
[108:35.89]First you take the peanuts and you crack em, you crack em, you crack em, you crack em, you crack em!
[108:41.01]Let's go!
[108:41.52]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly!
[108:44.78]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly.
[108:48.32]Then you take the peanuts and you mash them, you mash them, you mash them, mash them, mash them.
[108:53.71]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly.
[108:59.99]Oh, you're fucking me up so bad.
[109:01.33]You take the bread and you spread it, you spread it, you spread it, spread it, spread it.
[109:07.00]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly.
[109:09.70]Peanut, peanut butter, and jelly.
[109:14.89]No!
[109:16.97]God damn it!
[109:24.66]Die!
[109:25.44]Please!
[109:25.94]I can't do this.
[109:26.56]This song goes fucking hard, by the way.
[109:42.01]Shit!
[109:51.16]No!
[109:51.56]I don't know what to do!
[109:55.94]I don't know what to do.
[109:58.62]I'm fucked here.
[110:02.06]Don't blow anything up.
[110:03.12]I have to go for it.
[110:03.80]Alright, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[110:06.06]That song was pretty cool, but alright, hold on.
[110:10.94]I need to see where they are.
[110:11.84]Alright.
[110:12.48]They're on the belly and then on the neck line.
[110:14.71]Belly, neck.
[110:19.13]And then on the neck, on the neck, on the neck.
[110:24.92]Where?
[110:25.50]Alright.
[110:25.80]Just give me the key card and get me the fuck out of here.
[110:51.72]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[110:55.30]Peanut, peanut butter.
[111:08.31]The fact that people say that was Leon singing... ...made that a hundred fucking times funnier.
[111:18.17]Okay.
[111:19.85]I need to go back for the items.
[111:27.36]It was Ashley too?
[111:29.26]Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[111:30.73]That's so stupid.
[112:07.97]Whatever.
[112:11.51]Whatever, whatever.
[112:12.13]It doesn't matter.
[112:12.51]We're gone.
[112:19.78]I missed an herb, but it's fine.
[112:22.92]It's okay.
[112:28.36]Peanut butter jelly song.
[112:30.37]That was not right, but it's okay.
[112:33.55]Peanut butter.
[112:38.45]You missed a lot more than that.
[112:41.19]I don't want to go back there.
[112:42.09]I really don't.
[112:46.39]Okay.
[112:47.29]There is handgun ammo down here, though.
[112:54.67]Which I will take.
[112:55.35]I think that's good.
[112:59.91]Yeah, hold on.
[113:05.97]Yeah.
[113:08.40]Yes.
[113:10.82]Yes.
[113:17.04]Alright, we can finally leave one of my least favorite zones.
[113:21.72]It does get worse, though, if I remember.
[113:23.41]It gets a little worse.
[113:27.59]What does this want me to do here?
[113:30.11]Gap in the wall.
[113:33.29]Oh, that's for when, I think, when Ashley's back.
[113:36.93]Yeah, okay.
[113:43.59]Well, that was an interesting journey.
[113:45.61]That was fun.
[114:06.97]Yeah, the red hair is still there.
[114:08.21]It was voted on.
[114:21.93]Did it work?
[114:28.29]Having a leveled up rifle makes a huge difference here.
[114:32.61]I got through it.
[114:36.30]I just shouldn't sell that gun.
[114:38.12]Because the regenerators are now enemies going forward.
[114:41.40]So I don't want to have to deal with that again.
[115:02.51]That's surprising considering how panicky I was with the shotgun.
[115:05.73]Although I guess the shotgun is hard to miss with.
[115:16.99]Getting close.
[115:19.91]Only a couple more chapters remain.
[115:21.27]Leon.
[115:33.27]Sorry I'm late.
[115:36.11]No.
[115:38.43]Thank you.
[115:39.80]You brought the medicine just in time.
[115:41.88]Can you stand?
[115:44.44]Where's Luis?
[115:47.58]He was worried about you.
[115:49.90]Until the end.
[115:57.47]Come on.
[115:58.57]We don't have much time.
[115:59.33]Let's get rid of these things.
[116:04.09]Let's go get that item.
[116:09.78]Crystal ore?
[116:11.58]Crystal ore?
[116:11.84]What the hell is that?
[116:36.22]This is such a little book.
[116:38.83]How do you even write in this?
[116:41.99]This thing is tiny.
[116:45.63]We are imprisoned without warning.
[116:47.63]One by one, we are taken to the next room.
[116:49.25]I do not know what happens there.
[116:51.47]They just took Annabelle.
[116:53.75]I'm probably next.
[116:55.81]I've got to think.
[116:56.43]I need to get my head straight.
[116:58.88]All who are infected with the Plaga will be at the mercy of Lord Saddler.
[117:03.50]If he commands it, they will work... If he commands it, they will work themselves to death with a smile on their face.
[117:10.40]Adversely, the host becomes so simple-minded that they're basically useless for any complex task.
[117:15.89]However, we succeeded in developing the new superior species of Plaga.
[117:20.31]It has no special variability, but the host's cognitive functions are not diminished.
[117:25.85]It seems like they plan to administer this new species to the girl.
[117:28.43]It's clearly important that she maintains her intelligence after infection.
[117:34.75]All tests were successful and plans for mass production are moving forward.
[117:37.99]Project is a complete success.
[117:40.37]But I've been imprisoned.
[117:42.31]And preparations to inject me with the superior species are underway in the next room.
[117:47.59]Annabelle is not herself anymore.
[117:49.65]The smile has been wiped completely from her face.
[117:53.17]Writing is the only thing that keeps me sane now.
[117:55.56]Not that anyone will ever read this.
[118:01.56]Whoa.
[118:05.34]Whoa.
[118:11.58]Ooh.
[118:12.86]That's another 100% heal.
[118:24.69]I kind of just fucked that up, but whatever.
[118:26.17]Doesn't matter.
[118:26.73]We're at the end game.
[118:27.83]Doesn't matter.
[118:32.02]Give me more than six.
[118:34.42]I gotta replenish this.
[118:37.62]I have to use the bolt gun for a while now because I need to replenish the shotgun shells.
[118:46.97]Okay.
[118:53.91]You got it?
[118:58.19]Is Grotto Beasts shipping soon?
[118:59.23]Grotto Beasts is shipping soon.
[119:01.63]I imagine a lot of people are going to start to, in the first pass here, are going to start to get stuff within the next week or two.
[119:08.87]I'd be on the lookout if you ordered very early in the pre-sale.
[119:13.84]Stuff is going to start shipping here really soon.
[119:15.30]So, I would just be on the lookout over the next week or two, I'd say.
[119:22.78]Take a look.
[119:25.91]It is dropping soon.
[119:28.35]Okay, there we go.
[119:45.60]Blue hair.
[119:49.06]Blue hair versus red hair.
[119:56.02]Can we get a vote, please?
[119:57.18]Are we changing from red to blue?
[119:58.68]Yes or no?
[119:59.08]You're going to need to make this decision very quickly.
[120:12.58]Blue medallions in here.
[120:14.12]They're scattered around.
[120:15.26]Okay.
[120:19.43]Oh, there's a shooting range.
[120:23.45]Nice.
[120:24.15]Okay, cool.
[120:25.73]Some powder.
[120:44.20]What the hell just happened to my voice?
[120:47.20]I got a purple gem, didn't I?
[120:48.86]Alright, how close am I to doing this?
[120:54.07]Pull everything out.
[120:59.54]Red.
[121:01.18]Red's the cheapest.
[121:03.56]Pull that out.
[121:06.76]So yellow.
[121:09.84]Blue.
[121:11.64]Purple.
[121:14.12]Red.
[121:14.64]Green.
[121:15.12]I need a red and a green one.
[121:16.20]I can do another crown for 100k.
[121:17.30]Got this.
[121:23.01]I have a lot of coins already.
[121:33.58]I need way more squares.
[121:34.76]I don't need these anymore, right?
[121:37.10]That's the reason why they're here.
[121:39.89]Wow, blue.
[121:40.15]Absolutely destroyed.
[121:44.53]Okay.
[121:44.87]I'll do that real quick right now.
[122:01.52]Real quick.
[122:03.36]Where's the... Alright, blue hair.
[122:15.97]You can do it without leaving?
[122:16.89]I don't think you can.
[122:17.99]I think we try before.
[122:23.91]Blue hair.
[122:26.15]Let's go.
[122:28.84]The accessories.
[122:29.86]OK, you can enter the clothing.
[122:36.06]You ready for the reveal?
[122:36.80]OK.
[122:48.41]Miku.
[122:50.41]Alright, we.
[122:54.93]This is upgraded all the way.
[122:56.21]Once we get this thing all the way.
[122:58.95]We'll be good.
[122:59.67]Wait, you got new stuff?
[123:07.21]What do you got?
[123:07.67]Resources.
[123:08.27]I need these.
[123:09.73]Okay.
[123:24.47]Shit, I need more gunpowder.
[123:28.94]Let's do this.
[123:40.90]New game.
[123:42.16]OK.
[123:53.74]This is 4A.
[123:55.80]Punisher and the riot gun.
[123:57.95]Bolt thrower.
[123:59.29]And then everything.
[124:00.35]Oh dear.
[124:02.34]Okay.
[124:03.88]So what?
[124:04.38]I got...
[124:26.64]Do they ever connect all the way?
[125:05.67]How do you... I need to... I didn't know... I'm just trying to figure out how to... I don't even know what the fuck that was happening.
[125:18.63]It's the first time I've ever seen it.
[125:20.01]It's the first time... Oh, please.
[125:23.35]Hey, Jerma, it's the first time you've ever seen this.
[125:25.09]How come you didn't get 100% on it the first time?
[125:32.45]It's annoying.
[125:41.64]Fuck!
[125:51.56]Stop reloading when you don't need to!
[125:58.71]What do I even have the shotgun for?
[126:20.87]What's the bonus condition?
[126:21.89]What the hell was that?
[126:50.21]What are you talking about?
[126:56.84]Why is there so much travel time on them in this mini game?
[126:59.32]There's not that much travel time on this.
[127:09.40]There ain't this, I swear to God, there's not this much travel time on these bullets.
[127:26.12]Dude, what is going on?
[127:27.50]This thing doesn't suck this much in real life.
[127:33.38]Like in the real game.
[127:58.65]Am I wasting these or do I get an infinite amount of these?
[128:00.49]I have no idea.
[128:06.81]I'm not wasting them.
[128:07.51]Okay, I get four.
[128:08.29]Alright, alright, alright.
[128:16.12]I don't care about getting a... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[128:18.82]Just do it.
[128:19.22]I don't care.
[128:20.88]It's moving.
[128:43.44]That was pretty good.
[128:44.25]That's probably A. I'll take an S. Alright, we're good.
[128:51.55]This one's going to be horrible.
[128:53.83]I'm just going for a B on this one.
[128:58.81]I'm going for a B on this one.
[129:14.44]Oh, I... Oh my god.
[129:22.36]I... Wait, it's not... Shit.
[129:28.96]I... I don't like switching weapons.
[129:30.65]Just give me one.
[129:31.27]I hate switching weapons.
[129:32.37]It's like the worst.
[129:35.13]I don't care about any of this.
[129:36.43]I hate switching weapons.
[129:43.11]I didn't even know that could be.
[129:44.59]Guys, I haven't used the rifle the whole game.
[129:45.65]I didn't know you could do that.
[130:08.86]I want to hit two.
[130:09.68]My fingers are so huge.
[130:10.98]They just hit every button when I press three.
[130:33.53]I don't even care.
[130:35.40]I just want to get a silver coin.
[130:38.50]I'm not doing this.
[130:44.90]I don't care.
[130:45.26]Just give me a fucking A. I don't care.
[130:46.86]B. I don't care.
[130:48.52]Good.
[130:48.68]Let's go.
[130:49.32]That's fine.
[130:50.46]I am not doing that ever again.
[130:52.84]You know what the problem is?
[130:54.24]So on a mechanical keyboard, the buttons are spaced out.
[130:57.46]So this is a mechanical keyboard.
[131:00.91]There's like a huge gap between every single button on a mechanical keyboard.
[131:05.87]I get stuck in the middle.
[131:07.97]I'll go to press 3 and I'll go in the middle.
[131:13.23]I need a mesh keyboard.
[131:15.13]I'm not a gamer anymore.
[131:15.93]Give me my mesh keyboard back.
[131:21.77]Give me a mesh keyboard.
[131:22.43]This doesn't happen.
[131:22.91]Alright, this is the last time we're probably going to be able to do this.
[131:42.47]That's pretty good.
[131:44.24]Would have been nice a lot earlier.
[131:49.91]Let's conserve them now.
[131:50.87]Conserve it.
[131:52.47]Legendary.
[132:27.25]Legendary.
[132:28.75]No.
[132:37.02]No.
[132:38.90]Wait.
[132:40.18]Ooh, that's actually great.
[132:42.14]That's really good.
[132:45.84]That's actually exactly what I wanted.
[132:47.08]Because now I have two shotgun crafting things.
[132:56.21]Alright, I'll take it.
[132:56.93]I don't want... I got S's on every single one except the last three.
[133:00.09]Or the last two.
[133:04.46]You look flustered.
[133:05.32]No, I'm just... I just have red... I just have blood in my face.
[133:11.18]Alright.
[133:20.37]Does he sell gunpowder?
[133:21.51]I want the case that drops more gunpowder.
[133:23.80]I think I might already even have it on.
[133:26.06]Where do I have the money one?
[133:28.44]Let's see.
[133:28.76]Yeah, it's already on for gunpowder.
[133:42.83]So I have a 35% chance to get more shotgun ammo, which is a big deal in the melee crit.
[133:55.08]Do you have anything?
[133:56.00]You have these.
[133:59.86]I need square gems.
[134:10.64]Very badly.
[134:11.16]I have a question.
[134:20.97]Should I sell the bolt thrower now and go all into the broken butterfly?
[134:28.33]It actually might be time to get rid of this.
[134:30.59]I haven't upgraded it in a while.
[134:32.03]I haven't spent the PTAS on it.
[134:38.21]I do like it, but I kind of let it fall off a little bit, didn't I?
[134:43.66]Yeah, I let it fall off.
[134:46.80]I'm going to sell it.
[134:51.96]It's gone.
[134:52.44]It was fun.
[134:53.08]It's cool.
[134:53.46]It's a new addition, but I want the money.
[134:58.23]Now oh, yeah Molding a weapon to suit your specific this kind of work is about finesse stranger
[135:18.52]Little bit goes a long way.
[135:21.06]Better to be over prepared.
[135:23.78]Am I right?
[135:25.12]I don't always have this in stock.
[135:27.50]Where would a pleasant trap?
[135:35.31]Okay.
[135:36.77]I just need a bunch of gunpowder.
[135:50.51]This thing is empty.
[135:52.01]Alright, we're good.
[135:52.59]Let me load this up.
[135:57.88]Handgun is good.
[135:58.62]Alright.
[136:01.60]Sell the other charms.
[136:05.94]Sell your charms.
[136:07.84]Oh, these do sell for a lot.
[136:09.30]Okay.
[136:09.86]So.
[136:20.42]You can never hold more than one on anything anyways.
[136:22.49]So just sell the copies.
[136:24.09]Okay.
[136:24.33]Cool.
[136:38.06]This helps.
[136:48.41]I probably should upgrade this.
[136:52.25]Oh, the mines.
[136:52.71]Yeah, I can sell the mines too.
[136:55.78]Small key?
[136:56.44]Can I sell that?
[136:57.00]Why would I do that?
[137:08.53]There are no more locks.
[137:09.63]Oh, shit.
[137:10.15]Okay.
[137:17.15]This is going to make this thing disgusting.
[137:19.39]But I really should level.
[137:23.67]I need to use this for a little while.
[137:26.31]So we're going probably ammo capacity or probably power.
[137:37.54]I'm going to do power, I think.
[137:40.15]Put it into the revolver.
[137:41.85]I'm going to make a lot more money soon.
[137:43.17]I need to use this now.
[137:46.07]Sell this and just buy the rifle.
[137:49.74]Can I afford the rifle?
[137:51.04]How much is the rifle?
[137:51.64]Oh, it's only $12,000.
[137:53.18]Alright.
[137:54.12]Wait, there's more than one rifle, isn't there?
[137:57.26]I guess it's fine.
[138:01.29]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[138:01.99]Alright.
[138:02.27]I'm going to get the rifle.
[138:04.59]And I'm going to cancel because I need to sell that first.
[138:09.32]Anyway, let me take the scope off of it.
[138:14.46]Stingray is better.
[138:15.44]It is better.
[138:16.48]I need 30,000.
[138:16.70]Alright.
[138:17.18]Let's do it.
[138:17.52]Alright.
[138:40.12]We are good.
[138:42.76]I am not taking the regular scope.
[138:46.58]I'm going to put on this.
[138:53.19]How does it look?
[139:08.18]Okay.
[139:08.48]Very cool.
[139:10.68]We're good.
[139:13.22]Good strategy.
[139:14.70]I've got lots of good stuff.
[139:16.64]I am ready.
[139:17.18]I'm able.
[139:19.23]Let's go.
[139:19.77]I'm ready to go.
[139:21.13]I am tuned up.
[139:25.25]Where's the... I'm tuned.
[139:28.69]I'm ready.
[139:29.73]I am aware.
[139:30.91]I am a powerhouse.

[140:12.13]Okay.
[140:14.37]Oh, here.
[140:36.67]You got to see on your awareness report card.
[140:40.21]It's all good.
[140:44.27]I want to kill this guy without alerting everybody.
[140:46.73]That would be nice.
[140:52.93]Ooh, there are five.
[140:53.81]Alright.
[140:54.57]Remind me to do these.
[140:56.77]Yes.
[141:11.74]What's going on?
[141:13.14]What?
[141:13.44]Why is he still moving?
[141:33.65]Shut up.
[141:38.01]What is it hitting?
[141:56.60]The rumor said shut up right after I said sorry.
[141:58.14]What?
[141:58.30]I didn't tell you to shut up.
[142:03.70]Okay, so... There's one behind me over here.
[142:08.68]Up here, I think.
[142:15.25]Where is it?
[142:15.65]It's like that way.
[142:24.57]Go up.
[142:30.30]And... What do you think he smells like at this point?
[142:45.13]I smell just... I just smell like a regular... I don't know.
[142:56.25]Got everything down here, I think.
[142:57.53]No, just handgun bullets.
[143:00.66]Those are up though.
[143:01.56]I don't think I can get those.
[143:12.58]I have to get up there first.
[143:13.38]Okay, let's go.
[143:27.41]You look like you would smell like everything bagel seasoning.
[143:32.06]That sounds actually kind of good.
[143:35.74]What's the problem there?
[143:55.15]Oh shit!
[143:59.45]What's going on?
[144:15.68]Snap that guy right in the throat.
[144:16.90]Okay.
[144:19.71]What about here?
[144:22.29]I didn't shoot Ashley.
[144:24.31]That's why I was swinging the knife because I didn't want to hit her.
[144:26.21]I didn't want to shoot her.
[144:40.08]Really?
[144:42.74]No, I want square gems.
[144:45.59]Does it not swear gems?
[144:49.46]Very frustrating.
[144:53.40]This does not open.
[145:00.76]This does not open either.
[145:03.24]It does!
[145:05.23]What the heck?
[145:05.65]That's because I came from there.
[145:06.85]Are you going to BRB?
[145:10.11]Yeah, when I get to the end of this next chapter, I will BRB.
[145:15.49]Come on.
[145:17.05]Yes!
[145:19.51]Beautiful.
[145:19.93]Perfect.
[145:22.39]Replenishing.
[145:24.27]Yes.
[145:24.69]Very good.
[145:29.82]We're up 28 shots now.
[145:30.94]That's a good thing.
[145:31.52]Okay.
[145:39.80]Oh, actually, you do it.
[145:40.50]Okay.
[145:49.96]Okay.
[145:51.62]Cool.
[145:53.56]That leads us back up here.
[146:13.08]Where are you?
[146:13.76]What are you doing?
[146:24.65]Get over here, come on!
[146:26.61]Oh my god, it was so funny.
[146:34.80]Fuck.
[146:35.12]Fuck!
[146:35.36]I don't wanna...
[147:06.48]She just got locked.
[147:09.08]Are you alright?
[147:09.68]Oh, that was a crowbar in the head.
[147:14.41]Watch out!
[147:14.89]Okay.
[147:26.97]Everything is good.
[147:27.67]Please move out of the way.
[147:35.10]Alright, now this time I'm not going to screw this up.
[147:41.74]I got everything I did alright this time, so what I. Tell her to run.
[148:01.04]Yes!
[148:01.50]Alright, I still got eight.
[148:04.52]Very good.
[148:07.54]Now, I'm gonna do this.
[148:11.78]Because that spawns a bunch of people, apparently.
[148:15.29]Like, you do it.
[148:17.33]My problem was I jumped out.
[148:18.63]I should've just walked.
[148:41.96]Where are they?
[148:46.80]Fuck, what am I doing wrong?
[148:51.57]What happened?
[148:53.27]Wait, no, don't do this.
[148:54.91]Not right now.
[148:55.59]Dude, what the fuck did I just do?
[149:19.80]I followed that guy up the stairs the whole time.
[149:21.48]Okay, now do it again.
[149:29.42]This is just... Oh, wait, what?
[149:38.28]What was the point of doing all that?
[149:40.17]You can just go this way.
[149:41.89]Oh, because I unlocked it.
[149:42.71]Because it was locked before.
[149:43.71]I get it.
[149:58.82]We're good.
[150:13.11]Back up, back up.
[150:13.67]This way, this way.
[150:14.19]Follow me.
[150:14.47]No, no, no.
[150:16.63]Come close.
[150:17.57]Ooh.
[150:21.35]Get off my face.
[150:25.56]You almost just walked into that, Ashley.
[150:27.02]And it would not have...
[150:29.15]She literally just walked into it almost.
[150:30.55]There's a lot of handgun ammo.
[150:50.55]Any reason to go down here?
[150:51.43]No.
[150:54.43]Oh, there isn't.
[151:05.42]Can you recap every joke I was asleep?
[151:07.72]Um... There was the peanut butter jelly.
[151:10.15]There was a soundtrack to that crazy room.
[151:13.67]Then... There was... Um... That was probably it.
[151:18.83]You're up to speed now.
[151:19.63]Okay.
[151:21.37]I need two more still?
[151:26.56]Come on.
[151:36.17]There's gonna be, like, alligators or something in here, isn't there?
[151:37.83]I don't remember.
[151:40.37]Yes!
[151:41.03]Alright, I need one more of these, and I got another 100k.
[151:43.31]I need a red one, right?
[151:51.29]Oh, the Roblox birthday party.
[151:52.45]Yeah, that was a really funny joke.
[151:53.63]That was a really good joke.
[151:55.45]That's right.
[151:56.79]That was a really good joke I was making.
[151:59.54]Exactly.
[152:00.04]I'm glad that we all agree on that.
[152:02.08]Because that doesn't really have to happen, because it was a funny joke.
[152:04.70]Good.
[152:05.42]Very good.
[152:08.72]We go at the same time, yeah?
[152:11.80]Got it.
[152:13.70]It's not a joke?
[152:14.54]Well, a lot of people just said it was.
[152:17.26]Ashley, how did you mess that up?
[152:18.43]It's okay, we got this.
[152:20.11]Wait, oh, I messed it up.
[152:22.59]Okay, we go at the same time.
[152:24.53]Yeah, okay.
[152:26.31]I pressed spacebar, not E. Wait here.
[152:36.06]Okay.
[152:42.55]I can hear it.
[152:43.07]I can hear it going
[153:16.38]Goddammit What the fuck are you talking about?
[153:58.34]Oh, nice.
[154:03.16]I got, um... I got a... I got a hundred thousand dollars now.
[154:16.05]That's the upgraded regenerators.
[154:18.93]Yep.
[154:22.43]I forgot.
[154:26.28]Very scary.
[154:27.98]I pressed it.
[154:37.63]Is there a delay?
[154:38.52]E. There's a delay.
[154:43.56]There's a delay.
[154:44.46]There's like a full second delay.
[154:45.88]I didn't know that.
[154:56.52]Where is it?
[155:04.50]I know there's another one.
[155:05.28]This thing has no power.
[155:37.84]Why couldn't I just do it?
[155:39.96]Why didn't I just do it?
[156:09.40]You gotta be ready for an, uh, this is gonna be like an attack or something.
[156:17.97]This is fully loaded, right?
[156:18.81]Yep.
[156:27.56]Ooh, I have so many of these.
[156:39.71]I really have so many.
[156:40.67]Okay, good.
[156:46.44]Keep going.
[157:01.71]Hey!
[157:27.40]Power.
[157:33.23]Just checking.
[157:33.73]I don't want to miss anything.
[157:37.99]Alright, hold on.
[157:44.90]We'll heal.
[157:45.48]I need a few more of those.
[157:51.14]Alright, let's do it.
[157:51.82]I know it's coming.
[158:00.85]That opens.
[158:01.43]No, no, no.
[158:07.18]Don't use that.
[158:07.94]Don't use that.
[158:09.62]Don't use that.
[158:10.32]I gotta go.
[158:11.60]I gotta go.
[158:12.04]I gotta... Oh, God.
[158:19.68]Ah!
[158:20.74]Oh, shit.
[158:21.26]Okay.
[158:21.48]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[158:23.78]I gotta go right now.
[158:24.48]Hurry up.
[158:27.82]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[158:32.18]No! No!
[158:45.18]Stop doing that!
[158:54.18]Don't move! Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!
[159:12.64]What are you doing?
[159:13.32]Oh, you're going to turn to the thing.
[159:17.88]Where is it?
[159:27.86]Ow.
[159:31.64]Jesus.
[159:34.93]Okay.
[159:35.69]Thanks.
[159:36.99]Nice work.
[159:38.13]Very good.
[159:39.59]I missed a treasure, but what can you do?
[159:43.60]What can you do?
[159:48.30]It's okay.
[159:49.16]What can you do?
[159:57.40]Nah, what can you do?
[160:35.10]Sounds like you're at the grocery store.
[160:36.35]That kind of does you.
[160:48.68]But people are raging because I'm not taking like 40 minutes on each puzzle now.
[160:53.01]I had breakfast this morning again.
[161:10.61]I had yogurt.
[161:11.37]I already told you.
[161:11.87]I had yogurt.
[161:12.43]I had a piece of toast.
[161:15.21]I had a nice big glass of water.
[161:17.18]I almost lied and said orange juice for no reason.
[161:19.78]I don't know why you would lie about something so stupid.
[161:26.97]Rats.
[161:28.13]Oh, wait a minute.
[161:29.11]I don't think I got all these.
[161:30.53]I didn't.
[161:30.89]Okay.
[161:45.63]Okay, let's do it.
[161:46.09]Here we go.
[161:46.35]We've got red, green, $100,000.
[161:47.07]Now this one can do this.
[161:49.16]$27,000.
[161:50.20]Get this one started.
[162:17.05]Very good.
[162:18.53]This one cannot be started, but we're making a lot of money now.
[162:24.58]100k.
[162:24.94]27k.
[162:25.00]Let's go.
[162:38.14]I'll buy it at a high price.
[162:40.70]Anything else I can help with?
[162:42.36]You've exhausted our normal range of services for this weapon.
[162:46.40]If you're interested in something more, well, you catch my drift.
[162:51.78]There it is.
[162:54.17]This thing now will be doing like 40 per shot.
[162:56.23]Prepare everything.
[162:57.19]That's a good idea.
[162:58.27]Easy work.
[162:58.75]Good as new.
[163:12.49]You don't even use it?
[163:14.33]When I press this button, it is now going to be on my hotbar.
[163:17.75]And it will be used at every major boss encounter going forward.
[163:20.35]Don't worry.
[163:23.77]We're good.
[163:26.09]Alright, in the meantime... I don't think I'm going to be able to get a ticket, so I'm going for it.
[163:33.60]Do it.
[163:33.84]This thing is ridiculous.
[163:43.74]Oh, I'm going to buy... You still have those, don't you?
[163:46.96]No, you don't.
[163:53.04]Okay.
[163:53.66]Where is the... Magnum's already here.
[164:11.53]And how many shots do I have with this?
[164:14.11]I have 19 shots with this magnum.
[164:24.16]Is it better magnum?
[164:26.06]That's fine.
[164:31.28]This can stay the way it is.
[164:36.04]You're going to miss 19 times.
[164:37.94]Now, that would be really funny, but I don't think so.
[164:47.00]I kept upgrading this just because it's good to have.
[164:49.06]Handgun's doing just fine.
[164:51.74]It's all maxed out.
[164:52.68]Shotgun is maxed out.
[164:55.20]Getting close.
[164:56.18]37 in one go.
[164:57.93]Okay.
[165:01.37]I think this is a major encounter.
[165:03.31]Let me just make sure.
[165:04.33]Take a sip.
[165:09.84]I got the strategy guide down here.
[165:10.82]So it says that down here, Leon will be ambushed by four major enemy types.
[165:18.40]One chainsaw enemy, one regenerator, one question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark.
[165:24.28]Guy doesn't even know.
[165:26.00]And one boss is what's down here.
[165:28.66]So if I jump down here, let me make sure you can see.
[165:31.09]Yeah, right here.
[165:32.59]I went with the question mark is why would they not say that in the guide?
[165:34.85]That's weird.
[165:42.98]My ear is really itchy.
[166:06.60]Jerma, you might be the only person that needs a maxed out broken butterfly on standard difficulty.
[166:10.54]What does it say?
[166:10.96]I need this.
[166:14.21]I just think it's fun to do.
[166:17.63]Wait, why do you think I'm doing that?
[166:19.54]Because I feel like I need to do that.
[166:22.56]I don't need the broken butterfly.
[166:24.28]It's just a fun thing to upgrade.
[166:25.80]I got this.
[166:43.33]You're serious?
[166:54.20]Is this what they teach kids in school these days?
[166:57.19]Have you never heard of driver's ed?
[167:10.00]Why would Driver's Ed make you able to drive a wrecking ball?
[167:17.90]All you did is piss the building off.
[167:22.09]You just hit the building on the side and made it scream.
[167:25.35]What are you swinging at?
[167:44.48]Where are you going?
[167:45.02]What is he talking about?
[167:53.49]Open the window.
[167:54.29]Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shit.
[168:13.10]What's that?
[168:25.03]Oh shit!
[168:28.51]I just like watched him do that.
[168:30.19]Hey.
[168:32.89]God damn it!
[168:33.69]I tried to- What are you- Open the fucking window!
[168:41.05]That guy just landed on his neck!
[168:50.54]There's too many things happening.
[169:00.22]Where is that little bug?
[169:05.02]Shit!
[169:05.32]I actually break the wall!
[169:16.17]The wall's getting bigger!
[169:19.21]Almost there!
[169:33.34]She is.
[169:41.54]Ashley, stop.
[169:43.46]Stop.
[169:44.12]We need to think of a different way.
[169:50.45]I'm fine.
[169:51.09]I'm fine.
[170:00.17]Oh, God.
[170:01.69]Oh, God.
[170:19.73]Oh my god!
[170:22.43]What is fucking happening?
[170:25.49]Somebody is beating the shit out of me with a club.
[170:27.98]And I don't... Fuck off.
[170:52.50]Nice.
[170:57.58]Alright, collect.
[171:08.19]I think I got everything, most things.
[171:22.30]There's a lot of money over here.
[171:25.58]Wait, there's a lot of money.
[171:35.25]That was pretty cool, Ashley.
[171:36.49]You ever feel like a plastic bag?
[171:42.62]Yeah, actually, sometimes.
[171:53.71]I don't think I can get the other two.
[171:55.37]I can get this one.
[172:01.13]The last one is all the way across here.
[172:03.36]I wonder where.
[172:14.26]Down there.
[172:17.36]Maybe I can still get it.
[172:30.32]You could go back and get it.
[172:34.51]No, I got everything upgraded.
[172:38.51]I'm good.
[172:40.01]I've got pretty much this is what I have for the end game anyways.
[172:43.61]Maxed out shotgun.
[172:45.22]Maxed out handgun.
[172:46.50]Maxed out magnum.
[172:52.74]Is the shortcut right here?
[172:54.52]Wait, really?
[172:55.29]You mean like here, here?
[172:59.60]Oh, yeah, you're right.
[173:11.22]Okay.
[173:12.57]So that's the shortcut to get right here.
[173:15.35]So then... Ooh, there's bullets.
[173:17.11]Where are these bullets?
[173:20.37]Where are these bullets?
[173:29.02]Where are these bullets?
[173:33.32]In the trash.
[173:39.27]I thought you meant like in a dumpster.
[174:02.73]Very cool.
[174:08.23]Let's move on.
[174:15.10]There have been sightings of what appears to be a strange corpse wandering around, likely the result of some immoral experiment in the incubation lab.
[174:49.30]Do it, or coward.
[174:50.36]Do it.
[174:52.50]Do it.
[174:53.22]Do it.
[174:53.58]It's with the regenerators.
[174:54.54]Do it.
[174:54.88]Do it.
[174:55.26]It's gonna be an Omega regenerator.
[174:57.00]It's my least favorite enemy in the game.
[174:58.26]Alright.
[175:05.68]Fine.
[175:08.10]Fine.
[175:15.03]We're at the end anyways.
[175:16.15]Yeah, that's right.
[175:17.37]That's true.
[175:21.82]I really don't want to go back here and do this, but I'm going to.
[175:29.02]It is.
[175:29.22]Emerald can go in here now.
[175:50.73]Very good.
[175:53.65]Alright.
[175:54.65]Down in the incubation lab.
[175:57.02]Straight through here.
[175:58.10]Left.
[175:58.68]Left.
[176:00.50]I need to save it first.
[176:01.62]I'm going to blow through all my ammo.
[176:02.90]It's going to be a disaster.
[176:09.81]Have you ever seen One Piece?
[176:13.16]I've seen random episodes of One Piece, but I haven't really cared to sit down and watch that much of it.
[176:20.66]I've just seen random episodes on TV, just like scrolling around.
[176:26.43]My problem with One Piece is, isn't it still not done?
[176:30.11]And the manga's been going for like 30 years, and there's like 1,500 volumes.
[176:34.35]Where do I even start with that?
[176:45.84]Only five more years.
[176:48.88]Hey, I'll tell you though.
[176:52.12]That's kind of lifelong media, isn't it?
[176:55.18]If you were a fan of One Piece 10 plus years ago, you still get to enjoy it.
[177:00.95]It's still going.
[177:02.71]You still get to enjoy it.
[177:03.57]It's going to be a thing you can kind of pay attention to sometimes.
[177:06.19]That's kind of cool.
[177:07.83]Shut up.
[177:25.86]That thing's not dead.
[177:29.18]It is.
[177:30.24]Oh my god, this thing, look at how many things.
[177:43.28]Stop doing that.
[177:48.82]One more, one more, one more in the head.
[177:59.29]Ooh, that's it, right?
[178:08.85]Nice.
[178:09.07]This is a bad idea, but I'm gonna do it.
[178:13.61]I don't care.
[178:33.01]I just wanted the ruby.
[178:34.77]You wasting ammo?
[178:36.19]I'm alright.
[178:39.49]Alright, that's alright.
[178:40.11]I got a ruby.
[178:41.25]Kill the others.
[178:47.22]All this- Okay, I think I can handle this.
[178:48.80]Ready?
[179:13.02]Die!
[179:13.50]Alright, it was worth it.
[179:16.24]It was worth it.
[179:16.94]It was worth it.
[179:18.78]I got two gems for that.
[179:21.18]It's fine.
[179:21.64]I'm good.
[179:27.23]Dude, the shotgun.
[179:27.81]I shoot like three times in that area and it doesn't even kill the parasite.
[179:31.67]That's a lot of dog shit.
[179:36.83]Alright, let's get back here.
[179:59.09]Where am I?
[180:00.11]Wait.
[180:05.13]There.
[180:05.59]There's that.
[180:07.51]Back over here.
[180:09.55]And then bang a left.
[180:12.65]Yes.
[180:14.48]Up this ladder?
[180:16.18]No.
[180:16.46]No, no, no.
[180:16.74]It's just right through here.
[180:22.30]What should I even get at this point?
[180:23.73]Velvet Blues.
[180:24.59]This is limitless.
[180:25.45]I could just get a ton of these.
[180:27.05]One each.
[180:27.55]I don't really care about this anymore.
[180:55.60]All the velvet blues are... That's going to give me like 20, like at least.
[181:00.60]Grab the ticket.
[181:01.58]Nah.
[181:02.94]Get the funny scope.
[181:03.99]Nah.
[181:06.57]Punisher.
[181:07.09]Nah.
[181:07.91]I'm just going to buy a shitload of these.
[181:10.19]Sell them.
[181:14.33]I'll get the map.
[181:15.31]Then I'll get a bunch of these.
[181:24.29]Oh, I knew you'd choose that one.
[181:28.99]Anything else I can help you with?
[181:33.37]Hell yeah.
[181:34.56]You're valuable.
[181:36.96]Thank you.
[181:38.74]Come.
[181:41.54]Very good.
[181:41.92]46k.
[181:50.46]Am I at the point where I should just start selling the gems because I didn't find the other items?
[181:55.06]Not yet.
[182:05.55]This is good.
[182:06.15]I do want to buy... I should probably get this.
[182:10.95]That's the last upgrade for the case.
[182:18.18]Then we're going to do... I don't know.
[182:20.59]Maybe just do power, maybe.
[182:21.95]Yeah, just do power.
[182:22.91]Alright, looking good.
[182:25.05]I need rifle ammo, but I think I can craft it, actually.
[182:32.90]I can.
[182:33.16]I can.
[182:47.65]No, don't do that yet.
[182:48.45]OK, now I'll do it.
[183:15.59]Very good.
[183:28.09]Your body armor?
[183:29.91]I just upgraded it, didn't I?
[183:31.39]It's already broken?
[183:36.08]Already?
[183:36.56]I am molding.
[183:37.52]Oh, sorry.
[183:38.96]Alright, let's go.
[183:43.68]Whoa!
[183:43.90]Oh, it added it to the map.
[183:58.06]But where?
[184:10.51]Where is it?
[184:24.86]Nice wait.
[184:28.52]I could do two.
[184:29.39]Okay.
[184:35.53]That was fun.
[184:48.11]Let's go!
[184:52.48]No more stalling.
[184:55.88]You know, I... I was thinking.
[184:59.10]We work well together, don't we?
[185:01.68]I guess so.
[185:03.26]Right?
[185:04.42]Maybe someday I'll become an agent like you.
[185:06.28]What do you think?
[185:08.38]We could protect the U.S.
[185:09.34]from any and all threats.
[185:10.62]Is that right?
[185:13.14]Well, either way, first we have to make it out of here.
[185:16.96]You're no fun.
[185:26.08]I did not want to press the fucking button again.
[185:28.38]I wanted to press W. But I went in the middle of the key.
[185:32.68]I didn't... I pressed E instead of W. Because I... I just have never learned where they are.
[185:40.61]Because the mechanical keyboard is so spread out.
[185:43.25]And I can't even... It's just my fingers try to find E. And there's a big space here.
[185:51.49]And I just mushed in the middle.
[185:56.43]Gonna get my mesh keyboard back.
[186:25.33]Hello.
[186:35.24]Nothing in here.
[186:35.78]Yes, there is.
[186:43.64]One of the things they say in the original, they go a little.
[186:48.12]And the music goes din din din din din din din.
[187:02.79]I must stress the use of extreme caution when handling the Amber deposits from underneath the castle.
[187:08.27]Work with the utmost respect and obedience.
[187:10.91]It is imperative that you do not disturb the holy body's slumber.
[187:20.76]Treasures in here.
[187:30.47]This must be what Luis was talking about.
[187:33.05]Damn, that thing's probably worth a lot.
[187:56.78]Nice.
[187:57.42]Crystal ore.
[188:00.42]Dearest Lord Saddler, I am overjoyed to report wonderful news.
[188:03.95]Production of the superior species of Las Plagas is officially underway.
[188:08.71]If all goes accordingly, rest assured that we will reach our ultimate goal.
[188:13.20]The Plaga is a truly magnificent organism that has the capacity to live in any vertebrae, be it human, dog, or even crow.
[188:20.48]There is no other parasite like it on Earth.
[188:23.25]The superior species is particularly impressive as it can assimilate with a host without causing any damage to the brain.
[188:31.15]No one can oppose the strength of your dominance, my lord.
[188:34.21]On the contrary,
[188:35.27]Who would resist once they experience the utter joy that accompanies the absence of free will?
[188:40.50]I'm living proof how ignorant I once was.
[188:43.66]In a few days, I will have finished administrating the plaga to all the high-ranking researchers, and then they too shall know.
[188:51.41]And when your plan is complete, the whole world shall know.
[188:55.13]That was from the head researcher of the project.
[189:15.05]Don't touch that!
[189:20.07]This is our holy party.
[189:23.41]Our divine Providence ensued.
[189:27.27]Such a profound blessing for all.
[189:31.66]Nosplagger.
[189:36.64]Welcome, my children.
[189:42.89]I am Osman Sadler, the Speaker for our Lord.
[189:47.49]Tell someone who gives a shit.
[189:52.11]Foolish lambs.
[189:54.51]Why do you deny grief?
[190:00.08]Now, abandon your body.
[190:03.96]Obey.
[190:05.42]Obey the voice of our Lord.
[190:13.77]I feel like... Uh-oh.
[190:28.17]Thank God she's a really bad shot with this.
[190:34.63]Oh, she's a really good shot.
[190:47.48]Pray forgive these wicked sinners.
[190:50.06]My faithful disciples shall deliver to you your penance.
[190:55.91]Now, child, you need not be afraid.
[190:59.73]Submit your body and release yourself from fear.
[191:15.79]Stop ruining cutscenes.
[191:48.45]Okay.
[191:52.81]I got everything in here, didn't I?
[191:54.85]Yes, I did.
[191:55.29]Let's go.
[192:04.08]Alright.
[192:07.92]I have enough loaded, don't I?
[192:09.14]Which way does this go?
[192:14.67]It can go both ways, but I'll go this way first.
[192:32.72]Good.
[192:46.11]Very cool.
[192:46.33]Okay.
[193:26.03]Where's this thing?
[193:30.26]I wonder how many of those I actually missed.
[193:38.44]Probably a few at this point, right?
[193:43.59]He didn't even see me.
[193:44.85]Stop.
[194:00.37]There's one per chapter, huh?
[194:02.54]So I, yeah, so I missed a few.
[194:05.76]That's good to know for future playthroughs though.
[194:08.98]So we'll see.
[194:09.44]14k.
[194:30.84]I don't really need money for anything else besides a sniper rifle.
[194:33.62]I'm just going to make sure I have enough going forward.
[194:42.82]When is BRB?
[194:43.82]Very soon.
[194:44.30]You want me to read it?
[194:55.03]You want me to read it?
[195:04.26]No, yes, no, yeah, no, yeah, no.
[195:06.94]Alright, we'll do the TL;DR.
[195:10.70]A few people have heard of the name, even within the highest ranks of the U.S.
[195:13.08]government, and little wonder, too, the operation was not made public.
[195:16.15]Operation Javier?
[195:23.19]Started back in 2002.
[195:29.10]I don't know if the mission was a failure.
[195:31.53]It shouldn't have been difficult to extract a single stranded unit.
[195:34.17]Why did it take so long?
[195:36.49]The U.S.
[195:36.81]government let those people die.
[195:38.15]Brave young people who dedicated their lives to protect the country.
[195:41.33]I want to expose this crime.
[195:44.07]Operation Javier was written by an American journalist.
[195:53.90]How come a Jerma doesn't read comments like, you've got a nice sheen today?
[195:56.56]I just did.
[196:07.42]That's me!
[196:16.92]You've done well to make it this far, rookie.
[196:20.52]I've prepared a battlefield up ahead... Oh no, it's Saw.
[196:23.62]...for us soldiers.
[196:26.44]Watered by the blood of generations, hundreds of years.
[196:36.32]He made a saw trap for me.
[196:38.28]Hello again, Leon.
[196:59.22]Come on!
[197:04.32]So annoying.
[197:07.91]So annoying.
[197:08.89]It's so annoying.
[197:10.07]I haven't sneezed in like nine days.
[197:14.79]And every time I'm about to.
[197:15.87]When I want to do a stupid thing I want to do.
[197:17.89]It just stops.
[197:20.17]And I can usually look at the light.
[197:22.03]But the light's not on.
[197:23.38]The lights are off.
[197:23.98]So I have to look at the big ring light in the corner.
[197:25.80]And it doesn't work.
[197:32.58]Usually I can go like this.
[197:34.32]Bang.
[197:34.76]And hit the overhead light right here.
[197:35.96]But it's off.
[197:38.36]So there's one light over in the corner that doesn't work.
[197:40.24]Alright, we're good.
[197:42.98]Let's go.
[197:43.32]I can read this.
[197:49.03]Phase 1.
[197:49.47]Depart from campus with the target.
[197:51.07]Escort the target as usual until the start of Phase 2.
[197:54.47]There should be three others inside the vehicle, including Baker.
[197:58.47]Abel's unit will follow behind you in a separate vehicle.
[198:00.67]Continue to drive at your normal route.
[198:03.30]Stop the vehicle under the pretense of engine trouble.
[198:06.46]Transfer the target to Abel's vehicle.
[198:08.61]Abel's unit will change course.
[198:10.35]Subdue and restrain the target.
[198:12.19]Place the target in a large container.
[198:14.57]Baker's unit will create a diversion.
[198:16.29]Henry's unit will infiltrate the investigation's database and disable the network.
[198:21.73]Meet at point K-9 and transfer the cargo.
[198:23.59]What are they talking about?
[198:28.05]What does that mean?
[198:28.72]What are they talking about?
[198:33.58]Treasure here.
[198:45.38]A large gold bar.
[198:46.68]Okay.
[198:47.56]Nice.
[198:50.36]Get out of here.
[199:03.32]This game is so good.
[199:05.76]This game is so fun.
[199:10.48]Look alive!
[199:11.24]Is there really something in there?
[199:17.74]That must be so weird.
[199:26.97]Imagine you're just hanging out waiting for me at some point.
[199:29.87]You don't know when I'm going to show up.
[199:32.81]And then this is how I appear.
[199:34.23]This would scare the shit out of me.
[199:36.49]This would be terrifying.
[199:37.47]That would be so scary.
[199:38.42]Thank you.
[200:04.64]That's good work if I do say so myself.
[200:11.66]Reload speed probably, yeah.
[200:13.72]Try that on for size.
[200:18.33]See how that feels mate.
[200:19.79]A fellow like yourself should notice the difference right away.
[200:24.63]OK.
[200:29.53]Will that be all then?
[200:30.73]Pleasant travel.
[200:31.91]Are we enjoying the game?
[200:32.95]Yes, very much so.
[200:36.36]We're almost at the end as well.
[200:37.98]Only got probably like, what, another hour or two?
[200:41.28]I think this is the end of the chapter coming up here.
[200:44.24]Okay!
[201:00.89]Oh, wait, I remember this part.
[201:02.55]This part was weird.
[201:06.03]Oh yeah, I forgot about the ruins.
[201:08.25]It was a little more sandy in the old one.
[201:17.89]I've been waiting for you, rookie.
[201:22.34]Worried about the girl, is that it?
[201:24.30]That's just like you.
[201:28.46]You always had poor judgments.
[201:33.11]If you think I'm going to let you out of here alive, you're even more naive than I thought.
[201:41.64]You can't save her.
[201:43.26]You can't save anyone.
[201:45.56]Give it up, Krauser.
[201:47.48]Had enough.
[201:47.86]Being a lackey for these maniacs won't bring your men back.
[201:52.24]And what the hell for?
[201:54.42]Revenge on the government?
[201:56.95]I don't think they would want that.
[201:58.76]Revenge.
[202:00.26]You think I'm doing all this for revenge?
[202:04.76]Isn't that what this is all about?
[202:06.00]See, in that jungle, I had a revelation.
[202:12.04]The most important thing in this world is pure, unadulterated power.
[202:20.29]Those Illuminados have given me that.
[202:21.91]You know, you were always an asshole.
[202:26.01]Squibs didn't go off, Krauser.
[202:54.67]I just turned him into Super Mario.
[202:57.31]What's wrong?
[202:59.19]Show no mercy!
[203:32.13]What's that mean?
[203:34.97]You remember the basics of CQC?
[203:35.83]Yeah.
[204:19.46]Stop talking out loud, Leon.
[204:58.43]He's laid this place out with traps.
[205:00.05]I better be careful.
[205:00.99]I probably shouldn't walk into the red laser right here in front of me.
[205:05.07]Can I turn this off if I get close enough?
[205:33.61]What the fuck is that?
[205:35.79]What's going on?
[205:36.25]What's that sound?
[205:36.81]Oh, I got it.
[205:49.04]Did I get it?
[205:49.50]I got it.
[205:52.82]Oh, nice.
[206:18.56]Sent her down That's a pretty good one Sorry
[207:22.20]Slowly filling this back up.
[207:26.37]Slowly filling it back up.
[207:32.30]I admit, you've done well to stay alive this long.
[207:36.82]I'd be dead if I kept listening to people like you.
[207:44.15]The Reaper comes for cowards and the careless alike.
[207:48.21]Which are you?
[207:50.07]That also means the Reaper's coming for you.
[207:52.27]Don't talk over me during my big moment.
[207:54.11]The Reaper's coming for you too then.
[207:55.71]Doesn't that mean it's coming for us all?
[207:56.93]It's coming for you too?
[207:57.63]I would have been way cooler.
[208:17.15]I got him.
[208:21.75]Chefs.
[208:23.07]Four of you are going to make it through the next round.
[208:26.06]Only two of you will do this next challenge.
[208:29.42]Before you is a secret ingredient.
[208:31.70]Alright, I don't want to get killed.
[208:39.33]Didn't even hurt.
[208:50.98]What was that?
[208:59.43]You're really doing this?
[209:07.06]It's not too late.
[209:26.71]I got them all.
[209:35.96]He's going to run into this.
[209:37.36]Time for the Las Flagas.
[210:04.04]It's like Nightmare from Soul Calibur.
[210:51.35]Can I get time out for a minute?
[210:52.89]I'm crafting.
[211:15.40]Witness the power!
[211:18.48]You've lost it completely, Krauser.
[211:21.56]Hold on, Krauser.
[211:22.22]Let me reload every single gun.
[211:41.98]That's funny.
[211:42.34]That just pissed him off so bad.
[211:45.05]Hey guys.
[212:11.60]Get all this ammo now.
[212:17.82]I'm getting kind of stacked here.
[212:42.64]For the slugs, I got all 48 are loaded.
[212:44.58]I got 50.
[212:44.74]Look, I have 51.
[212:45.68]Here we go.
[213:10.60]Time for the teacher to be taught.
[213:11.87]Oh, such confidence.
[213:15.74]Bring it, rookie!
[213:42.31]Shit!
[213:46.30]Alright, he's kind of fast.
[214:14.10]Look out my head!
[214:19.53]What the fuck am I doing?
[214:21.83]Tab didn't open the inventory.
[214:41.72]It was stuck.
[214:43.46]I pressed tab.
[214:44.22]He just like backhanded me.
[215:10.15]Stop hitting me!
[215:11.01]It's annoying.
[215:11.57]What the fuck am I doing?
[215:53.10]50 slug Steven.
[215:54.74]He loves the cheese shotgun.
[216:00.10]Well, I put almost $400,000 into this.
[216:02.68]I'm going to use it on the bosses.
[216:07.87]And then if I run out of ammo, I have 20 shots with the fully upgraded butterfly at the end of the game and I can kill the boss in like three hits.
[216:57.57]Ooh, almost lost it there.
[217:20.23]I think there's some other items to get.
[217:30.42]The new knife is sick.
[217:33.02]I bet it is.
[217:36.21]And... We still have plenty of shotgun shots.
[217:51.00]Wait.
[217:53.76]There's no time to scape, somebody said.
[217:55.68]Yeah...
[217:59.69]Doesn't that happen?
[218:02.65]Did they take that out?
[218:11.37]Hmm.
[218:12.57]Interesting.
[218:17.31]There's a couple of very decent changes in the remake.
[218:25.37]Is it on professional?
[218:31.95]Oh, that's not the last boss, but I feel like this one is... Maybe I'm just remembering it wrong.
[218:37.87]They removed the underground huge monster.
[218:39.81]14.
[218:45.88]Beat Jack Krauser.
[218:49.02]Kill two parasites inside a regenerator with a single bullet.
[218:51.68]Okay.
[218:55.20]Destroy five targets at the shooting range with one shot.
[218:57.42]Cool.
[219:01.63]Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
[219:08.22]I have not gone to the bathroom.
[219:09.28]I'm going to go pee.
[219:09.94]I'm going to get some more water.
[219:12.22]And we will be back in a minute or two.
[219:16.32]See you in a sec.
[226:45.06]Hey.
[226:55.31]How's it going?
[227:01.13]Scared you?
[227:02.07]Didn't mean to.
[227:02.73]Alright, let's get to the end game.
[227:06.69]There's only one... I think the last chapter is very short.
[227:11.92]Let's go for it.
[227:21.29]We got one more after this, but I think it's a pretty short one.
[227:24.91]So this is probably going to be another maybe a couple hours.
[227:28.92]I'm not going to rush through this because this is a great game.
[227:33.73]I love this game and I don't want to just run through.
[227:38.45]But we are at the final arc.
[227:57.22]Their defenses are no joke.
[228:00.02]You gonna finish this tonight?
[228:00.80]Yes.
[228:07.32]That's gotta be their sanctuary.
[228:08.78]I will finish the game tonight.
[228:11.68]Ashley.
[228:22.85]Okay.
[228:26.58]I feel like I gotta move in a little more.
[228:27.98]I feel like I'm too far away from everything.
[228:35.98]That's better.
[228:36.67]Okay, good.
[228:41.83]Let's go.
[228:45.67]Wait, I just... No, we're good.
[228:48.35]When's the boss fight?
[228:49.25]I just did one, man.
[228:55.18]You could probably play through most of the game with the knife.
[228:57.44]So this is the better knife.
[228:59.80]Should I sell the other one?
[229:20.22]Should I sell the combat knife?
[229:27.86]Why not?
[229:30.42]Just upgrade the other one?
[229:35.82]You could keep both.
[229:38.06]Oh, so when this one's done, I can go to this one.
[229:40.30]Oh, so I get to have two.
[229:42.56]Okay.
[229:44.57]Well, then I guess I will tune it up, or nah.
[229:47.13]I'm going to stick with the plan.
[229:50.05]I'm going to stick with the plan.
[229:56.37]That's cool, though.
[229:59.55]40% off.
[229:59.97]Damn.
[230:01.57]I'm not going to use it anyways.
[230:05.51]I've already got my setup.
[230:11.66]Is it equipped?
[230:14.26]It's not equipped.
[230:14.92]I'll equip it after.
[230:15.58]Let's go.
[230:25.06]Buy resources?
[230:27.97]Did he fill the shop up with resources?
[230:29.89]Oh, he did.
[230:32.39]Okay.
[230:32.83]Okay.
[230:53.05]Okay.
[231:02.96]Save it again.
[231:05.79]I would be so bad with the save shit.
[231:07.41]I just, I'm such a compulsive saver.
[231:09.77]Okay.
[231:33.66]He almost hit your friend!
[232:06.06]Back up You got it

[233:01.65]Back here.
[233:10.56]I mean, I'm farming right now.
[233:12.12]This actually is kind of cool.
[233:13.60]I can just farm.
[233:28.56]Alright, I'm done.

[240:28.11]I don't know, dude.

[244:23.66]He got triple tapped me in a melee.
[244:28.02]They don't even swing that much.
[244:29.54]They literally don't even swing more than three times.
[244:32.06]More than two.
[244:32.94]Good thing I saved it.
[244:48.34]It pisses me off when they do the little juke.
[244:54.04]I'm so angry about that.
[244:56.84]They do the... Just reload.
[245:00.21]Just kill me.
[245:00.65]Reload.
[245:01.11]Just reload.
[245:01.55]Reload.
[245:01.93]Just hit me.
[245:02.97]Just reload it.
[245:03.55]Reload it.
[245:03.87]Reload it.
[245:04.31]This is stupid.
[245:08.95]Holy shit, dude.
[245:15.97]Stop overreacting?
[245:18.07]How?
[245:18.39]I'm not.
[245:22.30]This is just fucking mayhem every five seconds.
[245:35.47]Oh my god.
[245:36.23]This is just fucking mayhem.
[245:43.89]They don't even know what they're attacking.
[245:45.37]They're just shooting at random people.
[245:49.19]Look at this.
[245:50.03]I can't even run.
[246:13.82]Okay.
[246:18.88]Yeah.
[246:20.06]Yeah.
[246:20.48]Good.
[246:21.00]Nice job.
[246:22.34]Fuck you.
[246:37.58]What are you all doing?
[246:39.00]You weren't even near me.
[246:40.57]Literally nobody was here.
[247:34.13]I have a sniper rifle.
[247:35.19]Are you dumb?
[247:46.19]I just spent 15 hours in game without a sniper rifle.
[247:50.44]So now I have one magically and my brain's just like, no, you don't.
[247:53.68]Alright, let's go.
[247:54.94]Anything else I need to do here?
[247:55.74]I don't think so.
[247:59.68]I have to like put these.
[248:01.48]Oh, yeah.
[248:01.94]Okay, here we go.
[248:18.88]Don't even think about it.
[248:19.70]Don't even think about it.
[248:24.95]Don't even think about it.
[248:32.71]Go.
[248:40.02]What's the best way to get over there?
[248:53.51]Oh, God is one of those things.
[248:54.47]What's wrong with me?
[248:57.90]What is wrong with my character?
[248:58.90]Why am I limping like this?
[249:02.62]Why am I limping?
[249:15.67]Alright, how do I get over there?
[249:48.52]Through this building.
[249:49.26]Okay, through here.
[249:51.99]This way.
[250:08.54]And then... Wait, how do I get in there?
[250:14.82]Can I press the... Is there an elevator I can press?
[250:19.55]I can't go in there.
[250:20.30]Hold on.
[250:21.52]There.
[250:21.74]Alright, let's go.
[250:52.46]Imagine being in this orchestra and this is a killing zombies soundtrack.
[250:57.72]Really, that'd be kind of cool.
[251:00.96]Anybody?
[251:01.24]No.
[251:01.58]Let's go.
[251:08.56]There's probably treasures and shit here, but anytime this music plays like this, I just have to run.
[251:13.79]This is just panic music.
[251:16.43]Remember when I used to turn off the music for Dark Souls bosses and win?
[251:20.73]Same scenario.
[251:30.65]Get in!
[251:32.87]Thanks.
[251:34.45]When we get out of here, drinks are on me.
[251:44.86]I know a good bar.
[251:49.84]Yeah, keep your head down.
[251:53.80]Nice and slow.
[252:16.24]He's alright.
[252:18.96]He's okay.
[252:20.32]He's alright.
[252:33.82]This is new.
[252:35.90]I think this actually is new.
[252:38.63]Yeah, this is new.
[252:54.87]In the old one, doesn't he use his arm and go through the windshield?
[253:09.24]Oh, it's a rocket launcher.
[253:10.32]Right.
[253:11.48]Interesting.
[253:12.00]Okay.
[253:13.24]It was a rocket.
[253:13.78]Right, right, right, right.
[253:19.89]Okay.
[253:21.21]Ooh.
[253:21.35]Ooh.
[253:30.30]Let's check up here first.
[253:34.88]Honestly, that makes a bit more sense, but whatever.
[253:43.85]I got a lot of money.
[253:44.67]Is there anything else I want to do?
[253:45.73]Before I get to the very end here?
[253:56.49]Make sure you shoot this medallion here.
[254:01.01]Oh, shit.
[254:01.25]I can't even see it.
[254:01.85]We're good.
[254:15.68]Okay.
[254:19.99]Blue medallions.
[254:21.63]Any more here?
[254:25.41]Looks like there's another... I think I have to get them alright now.
[254:41.86]Where is this one?
[254:55.07]Is it in the water?
[255:04.20]It's below me.
[255:04.74]It's below me.
[255:08.86]Okay, what about this one?
[255:13.63]There's one up here.
[255:14.25]What's the best way to go up there?
[255:20.21]I don't know.
[255:28.29]Okay.
[255:31.92]Below me.
[255:32.56]Below me!
[255:34.20]Whatever!
[255:45.05]Where is this thing?
[255:52.67]I don't know where it is.
[255:55.01]I don't really care about the spinals anymore anyways.
[255:56.92]Is it down?
[256:01.82]Maybe.
[256:09.29]In here somewhere?
[256:10.15]What is it?
[256:14.88]What is this?
[256:15.40]Ooh, staff of royalty.
[256:23.88]Very cool.
[256:27.30]Nice.
[256:31.55]That's probably worth a lot.
[256:32.41]Okay, this is in here somewhere.
[256:42.49]No, it's not.
[256:44.41]I don't even care.
[256:44.99]I'm leaving.
[256:45.33]You just have to give up and then you'll find it.
[256:58.62]This one is... I wonder if I can... No, wait, wait.
[257:00.54]I think I can... Can I lean out the edge here and get this one if I go out here?
[257:03.64]Like if I go down here and look that way?
[257:41.15]Oh finished let's go
[257:58.50]You should cosplay as Leon.
[257:59.60]We talked about it the other day.
[258:00.44]I'll do it on your birthday.
[258:28.43]Whose birthday?
[258:29.19]Um, whoever's birthday is... Uh, never mind.
[258:36.91]I take it back.
[258:41.79]The repairs were completed without issue since the facility was previously used for confinement.
[258:47.50]The work required to reinforce the airtight ceiling was minimal.
[258:51.42]As long as we don't run into any issues with the cooling system test, we plan to bring in all the remaining specimens from Facility 1.
[259:02.78]We changed my title.
[259:08.32]All specimens were successfully transferred.
[259:10.88]However, we experienced a slight hiccup during transport as one of them became violent.
[259:15.28]Luckily, the number of casualties was less than anticipated.
[259:20.26]Please be extra careful when dealing with them.
[259:21.92]We have received reports that they are beginning to acquire a tolerance for the low temperatures.
[259:25.50]God.
[259:34.60]I think I can make some gear now.
[259:37.72]Alright.
[259:49.81]Loading back up.
[259:53.22]This doesn't open.
[259:53.94]I hear a thingy.
[260:04.99]Splendid bangle.
[260:13.17]Okay.
[260:22.48]These are gonna open, aren't they?
[260:27.90]Go!
[260:28.28]Quick!
[260:37.30]So I'm gonna jump out on one of these.
[260:38.48]I know it.
[260:42.43]What was that?
[260:42.89]What the fuck?
[261:20.51]No, you're on the ground.
[261:21.49]That's so annoying.
[261:22.35]Oh god.
[262:06.23]OK.
[262:21.98]Homer Simpson.
[262:26.15]Maybe a little.
[262:42.05]Nice.
[262:42.37]Eight.
[262:48.21]I think it's just all money at this point.
[262:50.65]What's that face?
[262:51.67]What's that face?
[262:52.91]I think I'm just going full on money.
[262:55.30]Yeah, we're just doing money.
[262:56.56]Let's go.
[263:11.06]interesting choice I mean in a good way of course oh I knew you'd choose that one 25k hell yeah 25k again ruby's all rubbish he makes no difference thank you come back
[263:41.56]Let's go.
[263:43.32]I have so many.
[263:43.94]There might be time just to start selling everything.
[263:45.92]It's probably time to start selling.
[263:48.83]Sniper rifle all the way?
[263:50.09]I can get close.
[264:22.20]Try that on for size.
[264:26.16]This kind of work is about finesse, stranger.
[264:30.16]Little bit goes a long way.
[264:32.88]You'll see.
[264:34.26]Very cool.
[264:35.30]Don't get yourself killed now.
[264:37.93]Oh, there's another one of those down there.
[264:39.35]Nice.
[264:40.65]Alright.
[264:41.39]What can I do here?
[264:46.79]There's another one of these?
[264:47.67]Holy shit.
[264:49.65]Okay.
[264:58.09]Gotta check it out.
[265:15.78]Oh no, this is just if you want to do it again.
[265:17.38]Meh, I'm good.
[265:27.11]Yeah, I'm good.
[265:28.39]It's a really cool part of the game, but I'm good.
[265:32.96]I don't need all S ranks.
[265:55.37]Sell the old knife?
[265:56.35]I'll probably just hang on to it, honestly.
[265:57.63]Might need it.
[266:03.55]Okay.
[266:09.94]This is where we're going.
[266:11.60]Let's go.
[266:12.00]Really?
[266:13.70]Alright.
[266:25.95]Are you finishing the game tonight?
[266:50.63]You betcha.
[266:56.52]Yes, I am.
[267:06.98]What happened up there?
[267:20.89]Oh, come on, dude.
[267:46.74]I hear a bug.
[267:54.36]There's so many critters in this game.
[267:58.56]There are a lot of critters.
[267:59.46]You're right.
[268:04.79]Why is it playing this music?
[268:09.43]This is what I'm talking about.
[268:10.27]Why is it playing this?
[268:15.69]This is the look out, watch out music.
[268:27.68]Nice.
[268:31.10]We are under fucking attack.
[268:32.88]Yeah, that is what that is.
[268:45.54]What's going on in there?
[268:46.16]There's a ha- There's a hallow- There's a Halloween house over here.
[268:48.35]There's a haunted house.
[269:15.10]Cool.
[269:23.44]Can you turn lo-fi beats on?
[269:24.98]You can just open it.
[270:16.56]Is that guy still in there, or is he dead?
[270:19.05]Oh, he died.
[270:19.85]That's a lot of ammo.
[270:29.90]Any plans for a Yoinky Sploinky 2?
[270:32.40]You had an OG Twitch dance.
[270:34.16]Now everyone's doing their own thing.
[270:37.92]Um...
[270:43.40]I don't... I don't know if my... I think you guys came up with that.
[270:47.10]I... I kind of just did a dance and then you guys named it.
[270:57.17]What's that sound?
[271:06.11]You're a Yonki Splunky remake.
[271:13.44]Where is it?
[271:23.11]That was pretty good.
[271:23.91]That was actually really good.
[271:29.53]Oh, thank God.
[271:34.91]Oh, my God.
[271:37.26]Oh, my God.
[271:38.08]Oh, my God.
[271:38.46]Oh, my God.
[271:38.82]Oh, my God.
[271:46.68]Oh my goodness.
[272:07.07]Where'd it go?
[272:16.11]It's opening the door.
[272:25.42]Dude, it's fucking opening doors!
[272:27.58]Okay.
[272:41.63]I forgot the last arc of this game goes very, very hard.
[272:47.79]It just gets crazy.
[272:50.03]Okay.
[273:01.64]Nice.
[273:09.38]I hate all things that are critters.
[273:11.58]Why do you hate critters?
[273:14.13]You don't like critters?
[273:15.93]Why not?
[273:16.65]Come on.
[273:22.56]Okay, well I need to turn that off.
[273:35.18]It's 11-11, make a wish.
[273:35.92]Okay.
[274:02.78]Would you wish for?
[274:04.02]You can't tell people what you wish for.
[274:05.10]Otherwise it won't come true.
[274:13.74]I know some of you.
[274:15.92]Some of you have wished for this.
[274:18.34]The Yonky Splunky remake.
[274:25.41]Wish granted!
[274:52.41]Anything over here?
[274:58.79]Nope.
[275:02.71]Not seen probably.
[275:12.04]I hear.
[275:14.40]Where is it?
[275:19.62]Red barrel.
[275:27.40]Alright.
[275:29.98]I, Adam.
[275:33.71]Creepy.
[275:47.89]Ashley!
[275:48.33]Ashley!
[276:01.01]It didn't go far enough.
[276:14.95]You have come, my child.
[276:17.84]What do you want?
[276:19.56]I simply wish to share this gift with as many as possible.
[276:25.40]A humble wish, don't you think?
[276:30.09]You see, we are all connected through the holy body.
[276:35.31]And now your flesh and bones, your very thoughts... Is that a skull?
[276:41.61]...are already one with us.
[276:44.19]He kind of looks like Bowser from the old Mario movie.
[276:50.48]Why do you reject serenity when you need only accept the sacred gift?
[276:56.68]Like she did Ah, yes the time has come to join our covenant Oh blessings unto him and the sweet mercy they bring and salt balls and let it be Oh shit
[277:33.85]Let's get out of here.
[277:45.15]Oh!
[277:57.74]Alright, time to go.
[278:05.46]Any items over here?
[278:06.56]Alright, where do we go?
[278:21.61]Laboratory B. Okay, let's go.
[278:47.49]Come on!
[278:51.39]He's got a lot of strength still.
[279:21.45]Come on, we gotta get fixed up.
[280:06.97]I was waiting for a jump scare.
[280:10.75]One of them is not going to grab me.
[280:22.12]The Undertaker entrance for WrestleMania.
[280:33.43]I loved that song.
[280:34.71]It was great.
[280:35.41]That was the remix version, not the original.
[281:11.87]There goes nothing.
[281:50.61]Fuck, I gotta do it now.
[281:51.51]Oh, never mind.
[282:07.24]He's faking.
[282:08.44]What, a faker?
[282:09.22]What do you mean, faker?
[282:16.21]He's faking it.
[282:17.27]That'd be so fucked up.
[282:22.76]Alright, this is the end.
[282:23.70]It was an awesome journey.
[282:27.81]It's time to get to the end.
[282:35.01]Ashley.
[282:37.38]Ashley.
[282:38.66]I'm right here.
[282:42.06]I thought you were gonna die.
[282:53.11]By the way, I didn't do it yet.
[282:54.35]I don't know how to do it.
[282:56.35]Yeah, I did this.
[282:57.51]And by the way, in me trying to figure it out, I broke two of the lasers.
[283:00.49]You're gonna have to hold one of them against your chest for the next four hours.
[283:08.16]Yeah, I found it.
[283:10.40]I think it says we can get out if we go this way.
[283:15.16]Hey, we're a team, right?
[283:20.00]Keep this up.
[283:21.26]I'll be out of a job.
[283:25.25]Oh yeah, did you draw on the map with a crayon?
[283:26.95]Escape.
[283:29.83]Man, Lewis got this thing going on a Raspberry P?
[283:33.40]That's impressive.
[283:56.62]Do not be fooled into thinking that Las Plagas are merely tools for creating powerful bioweapons.
[284:01.61]The true value lies in their ability to control.
[284:05.51]I've been doing that a lot today.
[284:07.69]No matter how hostile the subject, a single injection can turn anyone into a faithful servant.
[284:11.43]Who needs spies, and you can turn yesterday's enemy into today's ally.
[284:15.72]Controlling just one insider can bring an entire organization or an entire country to its knees.
[284:22.50]Mass production of the superior species has made this possible.
[284:25.88]We have empowered Saddler.
[284:28.52]It is clear what he intends to do next.
[284:32.30]Can you imagine if Sadler had that much control?
[284:35.56]Six billion loyal servants at his sole command.
[284:38.90]There'd be no opposition, no war.
[284:41.53]If for the first time in human history, the world would know peace.
[284:47.31]But I know how Sadler and the others have oppressed the people of this island for generations.
[284:52.08]I know how he treats them.
[284:53.76]That's no way to live.
[284:55.12]And because of that, I won't let it happen.
[285:02.35]Who wrote this?
[285:06.42]Who wrote this?
[285:14.70]That was Louise.
[285:16.02]Okay.
[285:17.14]Makes sense.
[285:24.55]Europe Laboratory 6 Dream Team.
[285:27.23]Red Bull.
[285:30.46]Holy shit, guys.
[285:31.36]Wait, this is... Europe Laboratory 6.
[285:33.80]This is... Umbrella.
[285:36.56]Holy shit.
[285:49.89]Man, what's this?
[285:50.91]Someone had a field day looting the Umbrella Labs.
[286:02.91]What the hell is that?
[286:05.25]Any treasures in here?
[286:05.99]First aid spray.
[286:12.58]Okay.
[286:14.14]Let's complete this game.
[286:17.70]Raspberry P?
[286:28.04]Whatever.
[286:51.79]I think so.
[286:53.31]Alright, this this inventory is a mess.
[287:05.53]This inventory is a mess.
[287:08.57]Why is it such a mess?
[287:39.76]Go health.
[287:43.30]Why am I angry?
[287:44.12]Why does everyone think I'm angry today?
[287:45.36]I'm not.
[287:48.04]What?
[287:48.66]Does my brow look weird?
[287:50.18]Does my face look weird?
[287:51.02]What's wrong?
[287:51.34]What do you mean?
[288:09.57]Your face is very mean today.
[288:10.79]I don't know what you're talking about.
[288:14.51]It's a treasure.
[288:14.94]Eh, we're good.
[288:15.34]That's because you said no roadblocks.
[288:39.21]through.
[288:39.47]Okay.
[288:48.33]Wait.
[288:50.09]Secret.
[288:54.24]No secret?
[288:56.06]Was the secret the other way?
[288:58.24]There are two ways to go.
[289:01.10]Resident Evil more like ResidentSleeper.
[289:02.84]Uh, we already went this way.
[289:13.62]Hmm.
[289:15.18]Resident even more like ResidentSleeper.
[289:16.56]Shut up.
[289:36.85]The final chapter of the Illuminados.
[289:39.54]Praise be to the holy insects.
[289:42.18]We have been promised Paradise on Earth.
[289:44.76]Man, woman, or child, his love does not discriminate.
[289:48.07]Beast, fish, or bird, all creatures shall be equally blessed.
[289:51.78]Praise be to the holy insects.
[289:53.30]We are the humble servants of God.
[289:55.41]His wisdom will overcome any mountain.
[289:57.79]His omnipotence will cross any ocean.
[290:00.97]The light of heaven dwells in all things.
[290:03.55]Let our bodies be the seedbed.
[290:06.09]Praise be to the holy insects.
[290:07.61]We are the flock and the shepherd guides us.
[290:10.39]Our prayers will be sung all over the world.
[290:12.17]They will be heard by all.
[290:14.19]At last, we shall exceed the stars in the sky.
[290:22.52]Osmund.
[290:27.36]Deep beneath the castle grounds I have found my faith.
[290:29.88]Oh behold, the divine vestiges left upon this world.
[290:33.44]It all begins here.
[290:34.98]Adam Sandler.
[290:38.28]Ooh, nice.
[290:49.95]Get out of here.
[291:06.90]I think I have to go that way.
[291:07.76]Lord and Savior, Adam Sadler.
[291:15.23]Can we open this?
[291:22.66]Yes, we can.
[291:28.68]Treasures?
[291:29.93]Yep, there are two treasures in here.
[291:36.64]What are you doing?
[291:47.22]It's further up.
[292:06.70]got it there's one more it's in this room I think this is it wow I'm pretty sure this is it this is the this is the end here I think this is the end take a look something's bound to catch your eye welcome well then what can I do you for
[292:46.69]Is it time to sell everything?
[292:47.69]I think it might be time to sell literally everything.
[293:00.11]Because I think this is actually the last place to see him.
[293:04.33]I think it's time to do it.
[293:09.53]If you can't beat the jet ski escape within three tries, you have to play Roblox for one hour.
[293:14.47]On your birthday, right.
[293:15.35]Okay.
[293:18.89]Don't sell the key?
[293:19.67]I already did.
[293:21.53]Sell all your weapons, too.
[293:23.63]Everything?
[293:25.76]Sell everything.
[293:30.28]And then walk out with nothing?
[293:37.92]I think that's good.
[293:43.68]Final tune-up.
[293:44.22]This is all good.
[293:44.70]Alright, we can do this.
[293:45.71]Let's do ammo capacity.
[293:48.73]And then... Just whatever I can do with this.
[293:53.21]Okay.
[294:08.01]Here it is.
[294:09.61]Alright, this thing's good to go.
[294:12.73]Too bad I couldn't get it.
[294:13.49]But it's all good.
[294:14.45]Buy the RPG.
[294:14.73]Oh, I'm good.
[294:15.70]Now we're good.
[294:38.57]Alright, I've got my sniper rifle, my Omega shotgun, 20 shots with a times almost two damage on the broken butterfly.
[294:47.17]This is going to be perfect.
[294:50.47]RPG?
[294:50.97]What do you mean?
[294:52.73]By the RPG, are you... What?
[294:58.23]I don't want the RPG.
[295:03.45]I got what I want.
[295:05.31]And that's 20 shots with a quadruple damage magnum.
[295:11.27]48 slugs.
[295:13.45]I'm ready.
[295:13.99]I'm unloading everything.
[295:19.23]Anything?
[295:19.75]I customize anything here?
[295:22.11]At this point?
[295:27.78]I don't think it matters.
[295:29.24]Maybe the healing.
[295:29.78]Yeah, that's fine.
[295:32.26]Alright, let's go.
[295:36.03]ended can we wager that you will miss the first shot with the magnum sure go ahead and make a bet will I miss the first shot I do with the magnum go for it go ahead and vote you can bet that now wait wait what constitutes a miss that's important
[296:00.65]like a complete miss don't hit any body part at all or I have to hit the exact spot that that matters like the weakness part we need to make that clear we're talking about no damage a complete miss just a complete miss okay or weak spot okay so if I miss the weak spot with the first shot then you can go ahead and pay everybody out if I hit the weak spot with the first shot then everything you lose and everybody else is betting on me wins
[296:30.98]The weak spot.
[296:31.42]No, I'll hit it.
[296:32.00]That's easy.
[296:32.95]I'm telling you, that's simple.
[296:36.59]I'm telling you, it's simple.
[296:38.45]I'll be fine.
[296:52.99]He thinks he's going to lure me out.
[297:00.20]Well, it worked.
[297:00.96]Because here we come.
[297:02.04]Ada!
[297:27.78]A heads up would have been a little more appreciated probably.
[297:56.68]real missed opportunity for him to be like you'll never get away with this that would have been perfect alright I gotta focus because I don't want to miss him
[298:26.60]I'll show you
[298:55.50]Got it!
[299:25.75]Ooh, that stings!
[299:29.97]Oh!
[299:58.58]Please.
[299:59.02]I have so much shit in my inventory.
[300:28.92]Get away from me!
[300:36.64]Oh!
[300:36.78]Uh-oh!
[301:14.32]I had to end it with the shotgun.
[301:59.60]Oh my god, that was a lot of damage though.
[302:33.06]See you later.
[302:37.86]Give me that shit.
[302:49.75]All 50 shots almost.
[302:53.69]I'll give you a holy body.
[303:11.97]That was pretty cool.
[303:23.40]Damn, if you don't do the rocket launcher thing, he takes a lot of hits at the end there.
[303:38.67]Ada, what the hell are you doing?
[303:41.53]50 slug Steven does it again.
[303:42.55]Nothing personal, Leon.
[303:44.11]Luis and I had an arrangement.
[303:46.92]Don't worry.
[303:47.70]I'll take good care of it.
[303:51.08]What was it?
[303:51.42]Three attempts or I have to play Roblox on April 5th or whatever it is?
[303:55.26]Bride's here.
[303:55.78]You coming?
[304:01.94]I think we both know this.
[304:03.82]It's where we go our separate ways.
[304:09.41]I see.
[304:19.93]I wonder how hard that is on hardcore and professional.
[304:22.19]Professional is probably a joke.
[304:23.55]Better get a move on.
[304:24.77]Am I a joke as in almost impossible?
[304:37.59]Go.
[304:37.75]Let's go.
[304:38.01]Time to run.
[305:09.23]to get out of here.
[305:25.54]Anything else?
[305:27.10]Why?
[305:27.32]Who cares to go?
[305:36.93]Not yet.
[305:52.66]Keep up the pace.
[305:55.16]Jesus.
[306:02.20]What's going on there?
[306:02.82]I love this rat.
[306:14.84]Can we take one of the rats with us?
[306:18.38]Open it.
[306:18.84]Go, go, go, go, go.
[306:50.02]Let's do it.
[306:50.84]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[306:52.18]I got three tries.
[306:55.22]Oh, we gotta play Roblox.
[307:15.46]It's pretty forgiving.
[307:16.79]It's kind of... It's forgiving, I'm alright.
[308:18.72]I did it.
[308:20.94]I win.
[308:25.01]Happy birthday to you.
[308:31.73]You alright?
[308:32.69]I'm not sure that was insane.
[308:42.09]Baby, what is this title?
[308:43.47]What is going on in the title right now?
[308:58.50]Mission accomplished, right?
[309:02.46]Mission accomplished.
[309:03.30]When you're home safe.
[309:06.52]Ashley Lee.
[309:07.44]Thank you for saving me.
[309:08.56]Jetski's out of gas.
[309:10.39]Don't mention it.
[309:11.13]And I only brought one more bologna and cheese sandwich.
[309:13.61]I could put in a word with my dad.
[309:15.29]We're fucked.
[309:15.79]Have you assigned to my detail, if you're interested?
[309:19.65]You don't need me.
[309:21.75]You proved you could handle yourself.
[309:24.67]Even if you could use a lesson in knife safety.
[309:28.39]Come on.
[309:29.91]Let's go home.
[309:44.24]We're not making it back to America.
[309:48.74]Like four gallons of gas.
[309:51.14]Whatever it takes in a jet ski.
[309:55.01]like three gallons that's great
[310:20.26]uh if you liked it if you liked Resident Evil 4 and you're trying to figure out if you should get the remake you should absolutely that's phenomenal and it's Resident Evil 4 of course it is
[310:49.98]Why'd you take the label off your chapstick?
[310:51.78]I didn't.
[310:53.16]It's like... It fits in a tube.
[310:55.55]It goes like... Like a little closer.
[310:57.87]Yeah, it's like Trader Joe's.
[311:04.52]Trader Joe's cucumber mint.
[311:06.90]It's like a...
[311:30.46]So the Plaga storyline goes through six.
[311:38.09]And then the mold is seven up.
[311:40.47]And then the virus, the T-virus is one, two, three.
[311:44.07]Or the virus.
[311:44.70]Do you think they'll remake five and six?
[311:58.43]Judging by how well these do, I think, and how much people really like these.
[312:03.55]I don't know if they're going to do 6, but 5 is probably up next in a few years, I would imagine.
[312:10.94]I think 6 is... I think you just pretend 6 has never existed.
[312:23.42]I don't know.
[312:23.70]You'd have to remake the whole game.
[312:24.72]6 was just not a good game either.
[312:27.17]Four and five were good games.
[312:28.77]To me, six was not a good game.
[312:30.05]Six was a pretty bad game.
[312:31.91]So you'd have to do a lot to make a remake of six, I think, better.
[312:35.07]I've obtained the Amber.
[312:37.95]Excellent.
[312:40.92]Just one question.
[312:43.02]What are you planning to do with this?
[312:44.28]I do not pay you to ask questions.
[312:49.44]All you need to know is a new dawn is breaking.
[312:54.46]A hundred will give their lives so that just one may live.
[313:00.10]I am expediting that change.
[313:05.94]So, we're talking millions of casualties.
[313:10.38]Billions.
[313:14.32]How ambitious.
[313:20.47]We're changing course, now.
[313:28.89]I think 5 was kind of polarizing, but I really liked 5.
[313:32.09]I thought 5 was really fun.
[313:36.43]5 was kind of 4, but a little more stuff.
[313:40.15]It had full co-op, right?
[313:41.99]That was a lot of fun.
[313:46.39]I think people give 5 a lot of shit.
[313:47.93]I thought 5 was really good.
[313:50.63]I don't think it's as good as 4, but I think it was a worthy sequel, I think.
[313:59.05]6, they just went completely... It was a mess.
[314:05.27]Honestly, I've played 6 recently, and I don't even remember it.
[314:08.92]I have no idea.
[314:11.10]7 was good.
[314:19.17]Yeah, the new arc was fun.
[314:19.99]I like 7 and 8.
[314:29.16]Yeah, me and Etalyx played it.
[314:34.14]Yeah, the new ones were good.
[314:39.77]I liked them both.
[314:47.05]The 2 remake was hard to beat when it comes to a remake, but I think they came pretty close on this one.
[314:51.86]I love this franchise.
[314:53.26]It's a great franchise.
[315:03.12]Resident Evil is one of the only franchises I can really think of that has actually continued to do really, really great games.
[315:12.40]This far.
[315:13.62]This late into its, you know, the whole franchise.
[315:20.05]They're still making... You know, Resident Evil 7 and 8 were... A lot of people, you know...
[315:25.36]I think they were good.
[315:26.88]I think that they're from one through eight.
[315:31.02]Only one or two of them are really not that great.
[315:36.16]I think as a whole, the whole franchise has been doing really well still.
[315:39.44]So it's really cool.
[315:40.12]I mean, I love Resident Evil.
[315:41.00]I always have.
[315:42.29]You said eight's ending was shitty.
[315:47.15]Yeah, but the game as a whole was fun.
[315:49.71]It was worth playing.
[315:51.01]It was worthy to play it.
[315:52.31]It was good.
[315:55.64]Listen to this song You should play mercenaries when it comes out
[316:15.15]yeah what's the new what's the content um release schedule for this because there's a couple of things right there's the little spoilers but um ada's campaign is that April 7th that's it really up next week oh shit alright are we are we gonna get the ada play um playthrough or is that probably gonna be DLC
[316:45.65]Hasn't been announced.
[316:50.15]That's cool, though.
[316:51.97]Yeah, Mercenaries was a ton of fun.
[316:53.75]I dumped hours and hours and hours into it when it first came out.
[317:00.04]Long time ago.
[317:00.44]Alright, well, we have to spend our currency.
[317:06.56]I have like 20,000 of it or something.
[317:09.69]Let's go to the bonuses.
[317:13.60]Yeah, I'm not even going to give you a rating.
[317:15.88]You know what it is.
[317:16.90]It's at least a 9+.
[317:18.66]It just is.
[317:20.32]Resident Evil 4 is one of the best games ever made.
[317:21.60]This was a great remake.
[317:24.52]They did a very, very good job.
[317:26.50]How do you tackle a game like this that everybody loves?
[317:29.68]And it's some people's favorite game ever made.
[317:31.18]I think they did a really good job.
[317:32.72]I think it's worth buying for sure.
[317:37.82]The old one is still good to go back to, but I think they did it justice for sure.
[317:40.72]It's great.
[317:51.55]They redeemed themselves after the Resident Evil 3 remake.
[317:55.01]Oh yeah, 100%.
[318:00.47]Absolutely.
[318:02.97]The third remake was, it was alright.
[318:06.28]Looking back with some time, it was alright.
[318:11.96]Could have been a lot better, but... Remember, they were coming right off of Resident Evil 2's remake, which is... I mean, that was game of the year for me.
[318:19.96]For a lot of people.
[318:21.84]So right after that, it's like, oh, Resident Evil 3 remake, it's going to be so, it's going to be just as good as 2.
[318:25.62]It's not even close to as good as the second remake.
[318:28.28]Oh, no.
[318:29.78]But if a game is a 7 versus like a 10, that's kind of unfair.
[318:33.28]Like that game was like, Resident Evil 2 was like a 9.8 for me, remake.
[318:39.04]You go right from that to like a solid, but like, it was alright.
[318:44.00]Hard to do that.
[318:45.58]Especially after Resident Evil 2's remake.
[318:48.91]It's kind of rushed.
[318:49.91]Yeah.
[318:53.69]It was fine.
[318:54.15]It was alright.
[318:54.77]Alright, I think we're good.
[319:01.13]Should I just skip this, I think?
[319:02.83]Probably.
[319:03.15]Hold on, I want to listen to this song for a second.
[319:21.95]What about the Dead Space remake?
[319:23.43]Do you guys want to see that?
[319:24.15]Should I play that on stream?
[319:31.97]Yeah.
[319:33.45]Should I play the remake or should I play the original one?
[319:37.19]I heard the remake is really good, so I'm imagining probably the remake.
[319:40.05]You would like it?
[319:45.65]Cool.
[319:45.77]Alright, let's skip.
[319:52.06]Get to the end.
[319:54.78]Quiet.
[320:09.74]Congratulations.
[320:11.10]Not gonna be.
[320:17.01]Not gonna be.
[320:20.63]Is it because I saved 114 times?
[320:21.77]Is it because I saved 100 plus times?
[320:26.51]If this was less than 100, it would have been A. I just spam the save because it's like, oh, I sold this thing.
[320:34.28]Save it.
[320:35.16]Oh, I broke that thing.
[320:36.36]Turn around, save it.
[320:37.10]I just saved.
[320:37.58]Oh, I saved it one minute ago.
[320:39.08]Did I save it one minute ago?
[320:40.20]Just to be sure, save it again.
[320:41.10]It's one save every 10 minutes.
[320:48.98]It's just for time.
[320:49.72]Okay.
[320:50.24]Oh, that's fine.
[320:55.16]Complete the main story on standard or higher.
[320:57.82]Ooh, unlocked a costume.
[321:02.42]Wait, I got the pinstripe costume?
[321:06.54]Brown sunglasses and a foam mask and a flight cap.
[321:13.08]Cool.
[321:20.24]Okay.
[321:22.88]So, I mean, I want to do this, right?

[323:47.20]I can't.
[323:47.48]I don't have any.
[323:53.78]At least unlock the cool models first.
[323:55.90]What?
[323:56.10]These are the cool ones.
[324:24.88]Alright.
[324:25.96]Let's look.

[325:46.22]You think I'm gonna give up that easy?
[325:48.66]You think I'm gonna give up that easy?

[330:07.20]The ultimate villain.
[330:10.49]I am Osman Sadler.
[330:11.53]It's just kind of like you could have done a different voice.
[330:16.05]A different voice line than that.
[330:17.33]That was just stating your name.
[330:21.89]Not like you will never escape me.
[330:23.81]It has to be just kind of, hey, this is who I am.
[330:30.76]Cute.
[330:39.63]Oh, rat.
[331:05.48]Hey, did you have fun playing Resident Evil 4?
[331:10.34]Did you like how much ammo you found?
[331:11.94]Do you like Osmond Saddler?
[331:16.56]I didn't think so.
[331:19.46]Are you smart?
[331:20.96]Yeah, are you good?
[331:22.02]Okay, now get out of here.
[331:30.67]Oh, I can't do a voice line for this?
[331:46.48]Let's go.
[331:51.35]These are the incomplete ones.
[331:52.85]I'm curious about some of these.
[331:56.05]Survive the battle at the villa without blocking any of the windows with wooden planks.
[332:03.68]Make it through Ashley's section without using the lantern.
[332:06.56]That's probably kind of hard.
[332:14.36]What are some of the high... Okay, this one's expensive.
[332:17.43]Destroy all clockwork... Oh.
[332:22.17]You get the super knife for getting all 16 of them.
[332:34.40]Very cool.
[332:35.74]I do want to do one quick thing.
[332:47.03]I just want to see.
[332:47.71]Whoa, wait, hold on.
[332:54.04]Base guard?
[333:01.15]Oh, this doesn't work with that?
[333:03.11]I want to see.
[333:16.72]I just want to see.
[333:22.02]No autosave parrying is limited to perfect parries and all weapon modifications will be available from the start.
[333:27.13]I just want to see the outfit.
[333:39.44]Yeah, this is the end of the stream, by the way.
[333:40.54]Those of you waiting.
[333:51.09]September I just want to see the costume.
[333:59.41]I look like a fucking dickhead.
[334:11.14]Agent 47.
[334:13.30]How far could he have gone?
[334:36.97]Anyone home?
[335:54.83]that's it what was that that was it turn the original music on and sound effects oh I could do that no that's it I'll see you guys later uh let's talk about what the plan is this upcoming next little bit so I will see you all on Friday I'll see you Friday
[336:23.67]So it is midnight Thursday.
[336:26.71]I will see you guys on Friday.
[336:29.86]We're going to just chill out a little bit.
[336:32.18]Play some Breath of the Wild.
[336:37.08]Just going to be working through it.
[336:38.96]That was awesome.
[336:43.22]I'm sad that it's kind of over.
[336:48.31]It's a kind of post-awesome game depression, right?
[336:53.25]Whatever you want to call it.
[336:55.31]Like, oh, that was really cool.
[336:56.79]That was great.
[336:57.53]That was worth waiting for.
[337:00.13]What an amazing game.
[337:01.89]What an amazing experience.
[337:05.63]And now it's over.
[337:06.37]But it's not, because I can play through it again.
[337:08.33]There's a lot I didn't do.
[337:11.91]But that was really good.
[337:17.82]Also, keep in mind, again, Grotto Beasts is going to be shipping for at least the first pass, the first pass of the pre-sale orders.
[337:29.97]So, over the next week or two, I would keep an eye on your mailbox.
[337:39.03]So, I think we're very imminent on shipping.
[337:44.48]So, that's really exciting.
[337:47.61]Say again when the presale ends.
[337:49.89]So, you could effectively operate as if the presale is over.
[337:56.04]I would say as of now.
[337:58.16]We are extending some stuff.
[338:02.00]The posters and all that stuff has been extended.
[338:05.62]Just by a little bit.
[338:09.20]But you can operate as if, I would say as if we're out of presale.
[338:13.70]I would say, yeah.
[338:14.99]Yeah.
[338:17.21]Now there is something that is going to happen to be the official, the official launch of the project.
[338:27.04]You'll have to see what that is.
[338:29.74]I'm not going to tell you anything else.
[338:32.78]But it's fucking cool.
[338:34.76]That's it.
[338:44.63]I'm going to implode, yeah.
[338:51.02]What time are we going to stream on Friday?
[338:52.08]Probably around the same time.
[338:53.00]Probably like 5, 6.
[338:54.42]Just put 6pm Pacific.
[338:55.88]Easier that way.
[338:56.98]It's going to be a really chill stream.
[339:00.42]Cam's going off for another little while.
[339:03.60]So.
[339:04.50]Going to relax, play some Breath of the Wild.
[339:06.00]If you want to join us, please do.
[339:10.47]Should be fun.
[339:14.18]So that was Resident Evil 4.
[339:15.60]And when the Mercenaries comes out, I'm sure I'll play it.
[339:20.20]For at least a couple of hours or something.
[339:26.41]Very good.
[339:29.81]Let me just quit out of this.
[339:35.77]See you on Friday.
[339:49.43]Are you ever going to play sorcery ever again?
[339:52.95]Let me get through Breath of the Wild because I feel like the Breath of the Wild berries are... They are starving.
[340:04.78]So let's get through Breath of the Wild first.
[340:13.09]What about House Flipper?
[340:23.08]Probably not.
[340:24.70]This is some new stuff.
[340:32.78]Don't forget my birthday, please.
[340:34.40]My Roblox birthday.
[340:46.33]Would you ever do Stardew Valley again?
[340:48.93]There's definitely a place for it during one of these chiller streams.
[340:54.92]Maybe one day.
[341:03.86]But, goodnight.
[341:05.44]See you Friday.
