[00:01.70]Damn, I lost track of time.
[00:02.64]I just did.
[00:03.46]That's a fact.
[00:04.36]There's no sound?
[00:06.67]Oh shit, hold on.
[00:08.71]There we go.
[00:09.17]Yeah, I lost track of time.
[00:09.87]I just kind of blinked and it was like 2.
[00:17.89]I was like, what the hell happened?
[00:23.05]Content creator.
[00:23.89]That's right.
[00:24.49]I don't have to say anything.
[00:28.91]I'm a content creator.
[00:31.63]I don't have to say anything.
[00:37.01]I also want to ask you guys something because I don't know if this was a dream I had last night or if this was a thing I told you guys yesterday.
[00:46.71]I don't remember.
[00:47.25]I have to ask you.
[00:52.02]So at some point yesterday, it was either a dream last night or last night near the end of the stream.
[00:59.20]I was humming a song.
[01:02.98]I was going like... I was doing like another thing that I do.
[01:10.41]I'm just humming a song with like a high-pitched sound, right?
[01:13.35]And I stopped halfway through and I said... I went like this, I went like... I just freaked out and I said, I'm fucking Peter Griffin with a different noise.
[01:24.13]Did that happen yesterday?
[01:28.08]Or did I dream that that happened yesterday?
[01:30.16]I had a dream that that happened.
[01:35.29]That did not happen.
[01:41.03]I had, okay, so apparently I had a dream last night.
[01:45.27]Where I was sitting here doing that.
[01:49.28]And I freaked out and I said, I'm Peter Griffin with a different noise.
[01:52.30]What the fuck?
[01:54.52]And there was way more shit that happened in that dream too.
[02:06.25]Was it during Bone... Was it during Boneworks?
[02:09.55]Wait, did that happen during... That happened on another stream.
[02:14.91]Did that happen on a different fucking broadcast?
[02:17.51]No, it didn't.
[02:21.43]It did?
[02:21.89]Okay, well, it happened.
[02:24.77]Hey, thank you, Libid Vader, for the damn capability subs.
[02:32.20]You've done that 40 times.
[02:34.74]I must be so scared of being connected to family guy that I have nightmares about it now.
[02:43.34]Were you tripping?
[02:44.74]No.
[02:46.18]I've refused to trip.
[02:47.70]I'm never going to do it.
[02:48.72]It'll never happen.
[02:51.28]I don't want to do that stuff.
[03:01.12]Nightmare.
[03:05.26]Anyways, let's talk about today.
[03:07.34]We're doing a little schedule pivot change today.
[03:10.15]Pivot change.
[03:13.81]We're going to finish Undertale.
[03:14.99]You know what I mean.
[03:17.68]We're going to finish Deltarune.
[03:20.86]And then after that, we are not going to play Umbrellas Not Allowed anymore.
[03:28.46]We're going to move from here to the tip of the hat stream.
[03:33.30]So we will raid the tip of the hat stream and I'm going to go over there and participate for like an hour or so.
[03:39.03]I play a game or something.
[03:39.85]I just hang out.
[03:41.81]So we're going to go from here to tip of the hats.
[03:45.31]Later.
[03:52.33]This is delta room.
[03:53.15]Yes, this is not undertale.
[03:56.53]I need to tweet this.
[03:57.75]So let's go ahead and tweet Andy.
[03:59.79]Be right back.
[04:30.69]While I write this, somebody said, are you going to stream the Diablo 2 remake?
[04:35.31]The answer is no.
[04:36.91]And I'll give you a very specific couple of reasons why.
[04:41.07]If I ever really sit down and play the Diablo 2 remake on stream, I feel like, and this is nothing against you guys.
[04:50.58]This is nothing against streaming or YouTube.
[04:54.72]That's a me thing.
[04:57.04]I don't really want to stream that.
[05:01.96]It's a me thing, if I'm going to do that.
[05:06.62]Because I don't really want to turn it into a thing that I'm streaming and just kind of turn it on.
[05:11.46]Because I want it to be able to sit in this chair with my mouth open, just staring and just not even say a word and just fucking walk around and pick up uniques and stuff.
[05:24.17]It is nothing against this community, the stream, nothing.
[05:26.93]I'm not going to stream that if I'm going to play it.
[05:33.05]Because Diablo 2 is great, but Diablo 2 is also a lot of just kind of... Oh my god, we got... We got 15 Gamerody subs from 07.
[05:40.97]Thank you.
[05:43.51]Once you get through the first few acts of Diablo 2, and you, you know, if you beat the game, you go through Nightmare, you beat the game, you go through... It's a lot of just like... Alright, let's get the cube.
[05:53.06]Okay.
[05:53.86]Get the amulet.
[05:54.64]You get the waypoint?
[05:55.14]Yep.
[05:55.78]Okay, go.
[05:56.60]Go.
[05:57.78]Alright, nice.
[05:58.88]Hold on, I gotta put a point in.
[06:00.34]All right, put the make cube.
[06:01.46]Let's go, Jario.
[06:02.06]Go.
[06:02.12]All right, act three.
[06:03.87]You get the white point.
[06:04.47]Yep.
[06:05.81]It's literally just kind of... You just go through the motions like 10 times to get like a pretty colored item.
[06:12.72]That's what we want.
[06:15.30]It's a good just chatting game.
[06:21.03]Yeah, okay, here, listen.
[06:23.25]If I ever get to a point where I have, like, a level, like, 70 sorceress or something, if I'm, like, playing the fuck out of that game, and I want to just do, like, a stream where I'm just sitting here doing, like, Mephisto runs while we just talk, then yeah, you'll see it.
[06:36.66]But I'm not going to start, like, a level zero barbarian in the remake and stream that, right?
[06:43.91]That's a thing I'd want to do on my own.
[06:47.92]Uh-oh, here comes the chimpanzees.
[06:51.74]All right, let me finish my tweet.
[06:52.70]You guys are distracting me.
[06:53.58]That's why I was so late today.
[06:54.41]You should play Deltarune Chapter 2.
[07:04.98]I agree.
[07:05.44]So let's get started.
[07:06.54]Let me just tweet this.
[07:27.92]Anybody else only type with their dominant hand's thumb on their phone's keyboard?
[07:34.48]I hold, so I'm right-handed, so I hold the phone in my left hand with my thumb up, and so I'm like holding it, kind of like palming it in a way, all my fingers are kind of around the edges of the other side, and then I cup the first hand, my left hand that's holding it, with the right hand, and then I use the sole right thumb to type everything.
[07:58.68]Is that weird?
[08:00.26]You use both thumbs?
[08:01.04]I don't do that.
[08:04.69]That's not a boomer hold.
[08:05.63]Excuse me.
[08:06.09]The boomer hold is hold with left hand palm, index finger on other dominant hand is poking while it's very close to your face.
[08:15.19]Excuse me.
[08:17.27]I'm not going to be put in that category.
[08:19.33]I'm a millennial.
[08:26.37]Did I even press the tweet button?
[08:27.46]All right, I'm ready.
[08:27.94]You guys ready?
[08:31.16]Here we go.
[08:37.53]This is where we left off.
[08:43.52]Turn it up.
[08:49.36]It's way faster to use both hands.
[08:52.06]Okay, here's my problem with that.
[08:53.33]The keyboard is so tiny that if I use both hands and fingers or whatever, I press like eight different letters.
[09:06.29]It's too loud.
[09:07.69]What?
[09:07.81]It's not too loud.
[09:10.41]Alright, here we go!
[09:18.19]So the last thing that happened was... Sand showed up and threw fucking lightning bolts out of the sky.
[09:27.81]And we had to like dodge them and shit.
[09:29.70]It was crazy.
[09:32.87]And one of them hits, uh, one of them hits Susie, and Susie's now currently, um, like, dying, I think, in the other room.
[09:40.51]Just like, yeah, it hit Susie, it hit me, and it hit, um, it was, that's the last thing that happened, it was fucking crazy.
[09:51.51]I'm gonna head out, uh, what?
[09:54.49]It's too loud?
[09:55.49]No, it's not!
[09:56.11]This is softer than it was yesterday!
[10:00.01]Remember, please apologize for timing me up for 10 minutes.
[10:02.37]Alright, so in the pre-stream chat, I timed somebody up for 10 minutes, but hold on.
[10:06.48]Yes, I apologize for timing you up for 10 minutes in pre-stream, but let's talk about the context first.
[10:11.30]You asked me to play Destiny 2 PvP tomorrow.
[10:15.22]Do you think that, is that a, should I have timed you up for an hour?
[10:18.15]Or is that, was 10 minutes, um, warranted?
[10:25.85]I'm sorry for timing, I didn't, I was trying to do it for like a minute, I'm sorry.
[10:30.15]That's a permavan.
[10:30.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[10:31.47]Let's go.
[10:32.27]I'm ready to play... I keep almost saying Undertale.
[10:37.35]So, quick recap.
[10:39.81]Um, Lancer is sick.
[10:42.66]He's ill.
[10:43.60]He saved us.
[10:44.14]He was in our pocket for like a day or two.
[10:46.92]He came out.
[10:47.40]He let us all out.
[10:48.08]We were captured by the Queen.
[10:49.04]And now he's kind of sick.
[10:51.06]He's like cold and he can't walk and stuff.
[10:52.90]So this is kind of... This is getting a little weird.
[10:58.29]Alright, think you can do it, Chris?
[11:00.33]Of course I can.
[11:01.05]I can do puzzles.
[11:01.97]Calm your skinless, boneless thighs, everybody.
[11:06.72]I'll think of a solution.
[11:07.84]I gotta get my voices going.
[11:09.22]I gotta get my voices going.
[11:10.68]Chris, just ignore him.
[11:14.34]I'll just be over here where I can't hear you.
[11:17.22]And I'll be here.
[11:18.25]Away from your IQ debuffing aura.
[11:20.03]There we go.
[11:20.45]That's better.
[11:21.67]Alright, so we're... Move.
[11:28.97]Oh, I see.
[11:29.59]It's one of these puzzles.
[11:30.81]Oh, I can rotate it.
[11:35.42]Here we go.
[11:38.60]Here we go!
[11:39.30]Here we go!
[11:40.90]Here we go!
[11:47.05]Here we go!
[11:47.47]Is that supposed to do that?
[11:56.37]Yeah, we got it.
[11:57.59]Wait, what?
[11:58.07]Hey, wait a second.
[11:59.57]How did you solve it without me?
[12:03.79]Chris figured it out before you.
[12:07.34]Jealous?
[12:09.28]Well, I knew the answer.
[12:11.10]I just wanted to see Chris try first.
[12:15.96]By the way, if anyone can tell me what that laugh was, you get 10 community thumbs up points.
[12:24.33]What was that?
[12:28.05]It was not Ganon.
[12:28.93]Nope.
[12:32.38]Laugh.
[12:32.66]Nope.
[12:33.48]Nope.
[12:33.70]Not Zelda.
[12:34.38]Wrong.
[12:35.84]Somebody gotta say it.
[12:39.70]Did somebody say it?
[12:40.24]I think I saw it.
[12:40.96]I want to be confirmed that more than one person knew what it was.
[12:45.65]Not Street Fighter.
[12:47.13]Not Punch-Out.
[12:48.55]Do it again.
[12:49.63]Hop, hop, hop, hop.
[12:51.99]Hop, hop, hop, hop.
[12:55.34]I'll tell you, it's from a group of turtles.
[12:58.34]It's the Ninja Turtles.
[12:59.86]I fucking just ruined it.
[13:01.06]That's Shredder from Turtles in Time when he jumps into the screen.
[13:05.06]And he puts you back in time.
[13:08.01]Oh, you got it wrong.
[13:08.81]Sorry.
[13:14.23]It's called Suspense, Susan.
[13:16.05]Dramatic Suspense.
[13:19.29]Nobody cares?
[13:20.51]I do.
[13:22.93]That's bullshit.
[13:23.71]Go what?
[13:24.51]Go look at it, then.
[13:26.05]If I'm so wrong, then.
[13:27.47]And you do the next one.
[13:31.20]Fine.
[13:31.72]Watch me.
[13:34.06]Also, my name's not Susan.
[13:43.47]Oh shit, these are gonna get harder.
[13:45.25]Child's play.
[13:46.37]Wouldn't you give me a harder one?
[13:48.77]For example, if anyone had a four-by-four puzzle queue... Just tell us the solution.
[13:55.35]Well, you see... First, you... align the shadows with the lines on the floor.
[14:06.32]Alright, what do we move first?
[14:08.96]Um... Chris, just do the puzzle.
[14:14.52]Just give me a moment.
[14:16.26]It's not like Chris could even solve it anyway.
[14:21.82]Uh-oh.
[14:22.23]This might take a little while.
[14:24.09]Or maybe not.
[14:24.59]Let's see how smart I am.
[14:25.47]Turns out, I know what I'm doing.
[14:41.45]Okay, I just want to go pick this up off the ground.
[14:43.45]Oh!
[14:43.51]No, I don't.
[14:48.14]Oops.
[14:59.77]Already everybody thinks they're so smart until they're not right.
[15:04.79]Oh shit I Don't I need a
[15:22.74]I feel like I had it.
[15:23.78]Correct.
[15:24.68]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:25.90]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[15:26.56]Everyone stop.
[15:27.14]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[15:34.50]No, it doesn't go flat.
[15:36.24]Oh, my God.
[15:37.18]No, stop, stop.
[15:37.76]Everyone quiet.
[15:52.77]No, wrong one, you idiot.
[15:59.01]What the fuck?
[16:02.69]This doesn't... I bet none of them go flat.
[16:04.22]Shit.
[16:08.16]I don't know.
[16:09.78]I thought I had it.
[16:10.40]How do I do this?
[16:13.34]Wait!
[16:27.95]Are you trolling?
[16:29.81]No, I'm not.
[16:31.23]It's just weird.
[16:32.17]Did I have it right the first time?
[16:41.50]I'm actually blown away by this.
[16:42.86]Time everybody out this is I'm bad.
[16:50.00]Oh my god, I'm absolutely blown away by this.
[16:55.45]I can't believe he can't blow it away.
[17:05.41]So like, this is maybe like so mad.
[17:10.20]I got it.
[17:11.62]What the fuck?
[17:16.68]Shit.
[17:26.03]Hey!
[17:29.07]Dude, I'm fucking blown away by this.
[17:41.18]It is funny when he cannot solve the puzzle.
[17:43.10]Omega lul.
[17:44.34]Is this the future of Twitch chat?
[17:45.54]Are you guys going to be like androids?
[17:49.27]It is quite humorous when he cannot solve the children's puzzle.
[17:52.17]Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop.
[17:57.08]You can't have.
[17:58.14]You just got lucky.
[17:59.24]It's just trial and error.
[18:00.30]Kind of was.
[18:01.20]For me.
[18:04.52]It was for me.
[18:08.01]I just looked up Shredder laughing and it sounds nothing like that.
[18:10.43]Alright, well, it's time for me to fucking... Alright, fine.
[18:17.81]I can't believe I actually have to do this.
[18:26.62]I can't fucking believe I have to do this.
[18:35.36]So, here it is.
[18:39.65]Let me just do it like this.
[18:49.97]Not there, where is it?
[18:51.17]It's when he comes out of the screen.
[18:54.81]This is not a joke alert.
[18:55.63]This is literally, I'm waiting for him to do the ha ha ha thing.
[18:58.65]There it is.
[19:00.02]So you beat Shredder, throw a bunch of people into his screen.
[19:08.96]And, um, what did that, what just happened?
[19:11.21]Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.
[19:23.23]And I was... I was the wrong one, apparently.
[19:35.37]Whoever that guy is... Got you.
[19:41.93]Let's go.
[19:44.81]Brute force method.
[19:45.73]Oh, Caveman could do it.
[19:48.45]Except Caveman died out because they're stupid.
[19:51.20]I'm solving the next one, so just stay here until I'm done.
[19:54.08]Yeah, like we're going to wait that long.
[20:04.57]Am I at the end of the game?
[20:05.63]Um, I believe I am fairly close to being at the last portion of the game.
[20:10.87]What are you two doing here?
[20:11.63]This one's mine.
[20:12.37]It'll be over in a second, so why don't you just relax in your mind palace?
[20:18.87]Which probably doesn't even have anything in it.
[20:23.22]I just need to figure out why the shapes don't go together.
[20:31.46]Oh, hey.
[20:33.28]You just gotta fill the whole square thing, right?
[20:35.30]What if you just piled them all in the corners?
[20:38.52]I'm digging a really wide hole.
[20:44.22]What?
[20:46.06]Chris, wanna try?
[20:46.64]Oh, what?
[20:48.72]Oh, no.
[20:48.98]I don't like this.
[20:52.58]In the corner?
[20:53.20]Put them all in the corner?
[20:54.73]I don't... This is not gonna fit though.
[20:58.09]What do you mean put them in the corner?
[21:01.41]Just like, stuff them in the corner?
[21:07.32]Can I do that?
[21:27.76]Did it work?
[21:36.50]What?
[21:37.78]Dude.
[21:40.21]Different corners.
[21:40.91]What are you talking about?
[21:44.37]They have to go in different corners?
[21:48.99]I thought it was just like, just put him in there, who cares?
[22:00.86]Isn't that correct?
[22:05.08]Oh, there we go.
[22:06.42]I thought it was just stick everything in the corner.
[22:08.92]I thought that's what it was.
[22:10.44]That's not... He's actually zonked.
[22:14.82]I'm not.
[22:15.26]I'm fine.
[22:16.80]I just woke up like 15 minutes ago.
[22:18.34]I'm fine.
[22:21.29]Okay, I did not.
[22:23.71]I woke up well into the morning.
[22:25.31]I promise.
[22:26.37]I didn't just wake up.
[22:32.76]All right, Susie, I did the work.
[22:35.10]There's no way.
[22:37.02]It's a computer bug.
[22:37.88]It's a glitch.
[22:39.10]You're cheating.
[22:40.32]Just like when you waved dust.
[22:45.98]How is it taste, idiot?
[22:48.74]Man, I'm going to relish this forever.
[22:51.02]All those times you acted so high and mighty.
[22:53.94]Well, guess what?
[22:54.90]You're not.
[22:56.47]Ace it.
[22:56.85]You're just a big dumbass.
[22:59.23]Just like the rest of us.
[23:10.31]That's kind of sad.
[23:12.33]Fine.
[23:13.91]I admit it.
[23:15.63]I'm not that smart.
[23:16.99]I never was.
[23:19.36]There, are you happy?
[23:20.12]I just... I used to be a forgettable little bluebird.
[23:25.74]No one even remembered my name.
[23:29.11]Then one day came the spelling bee Noelle and I studied for.
[23:33.48]When it came down to the two of us, she got nervous and couldn't speak.
[23:45.50]We lost.
[23:49.80]And I won.
[23:50.30]That was when I tasted it.
[23:52.42]The praise, the glory, the superiority.
[23:56.70]The addictive power of being smart.
[24:00.39]Since then, year after year, I've been number one in the class.
[24:04.35]It's only because Noelle helped me study.
[24:07.85]She's the real smart kid.
[24:10.57]Everyone's expectations for me are so high now!
[24:13.02]What am I gonna do once I go somewhere without her?
[24:20.20]That's why I wanted to make a new world.
[24:24.61]For us.
[24:25.85]A world where we'll always be number one and number two!
[24:31.83]But, I was so wrapped up in that, I got tricked by the Queen.
[24:37.93]Now, Noelle is going to suffer because of it.
[24:39.84]Maybe I did just like being superior.
[24:43.52]Maybe I am just... an idiot.
[24:47.10]Don't cry, chicken nugget man.
[24:50.48]All of us are idiots, too.
[24:53.07]Huh?
[24:53.65]I mean, like, I don't know about everyone else, but... Whether you're the smart kid or not, we couldn't care less.
[25:02.33]Screw up as much as you want, honestly.
[25:05.69]Not like our opinion of you could... Susie!
[25:08.52]Susie, you'd accept me even if I'm dumb?
[25:11.22]Uh, yeah.
[25:15.26]Like when your sister gets cursed in Dragon Blazers 2.
[25:19.12]Even if her stats suck, she's still your party member.
[25:25.96]Susie, a real Dragon Blazers 2 reference?
[25:31.94]Susie, you're not only kind, but a true gamer as well.
[25:35.94]Perhaps I underestimated you.
[25:40.69]Worry not, I have decided.
[25:42.31]I will turn over a new leaf from now on and fight for the side of ignorance.
[25:51.79]I'm not telling you to be stupid.
[25:54.50]Yes, sometimes it's okay to make mistakes.
[25:58.44]And make mistakes I will.
[26:00.58]Onward!
[26:00.88]Why couldn't Rousey be here to teach the normal lesson?
[26:08.57]He's a gamer.
[26:25.37]This downstairs table will be for our special guests.
[26:28.79]There's a dinner party on the second floor for everyone else.
[26:35.11]Everything here is tailored for you, right?
[26:44.75]That's screaming!
[26:45.49]That's rousey!
[26:48.97]Um, you don't have to scream!
[26:50.67]Just because you like my outfit!
[26:56.46]Oh my God.
[27:01.32]I need to take at least a minute for that one.
[27:11.19]Okay.
[27:12.97]Oh, Chris, Susie, how may I serve you?
[27:15.75]The hell are you doing?
[27:18.88]Um, Queen didn't have a room for me, so... She made me into one of her butlers instead.
[27:28.77]Whatever, Rousey.
[27:29.37]Can you heal Lancer?
[27:34.51]Come on, give me that one.
[27:37.15]Oh.
[27:39.41]It's cold.
[27:43.91]Suzy...
[27:46.26]I'm afraid this is something I can't heal.
[27:50.28]What?
[27:51.84]Lancer is... Lancer?
[27:57.10]Hey!
[27:57.38]You see, each dark fountain creates a different world.
[28:02.43]A world whose darkness reflect the will of its fountain.
[28:07.57]Can I do that one again?
[28:08.15]Can we do that one again?
[28:09.43]I messed it up.
[28:14.03]A world whose darkners reflect the will of its fountain.
[28:18.69]But through those darkners can exist in their own worlds.
[28:25.20]They might not belong if they go to another one.
[28:32.86]So can we help him?
[28:39.30]Yes, there is a way.
[28:41.77]Castletown's Grand Fountain is made of pure darkness.
[28:45.14]As long as it stays flowing, any Darkner can live there.
[28:49.90]So, if we bring Lancer back to school, he'll be okay again.
[29:00.07]He thinks he's a voice actor.
[29:03.37]So we just need to get out of here, huh?
[29:05.80]Right.
[29:07.72]All right.
[29:09.14]Lancer, we'll be back for you, buddy.
[29:11.48]So he can't jump between dark worlds.
[29:15.69]Your friend, if we defeat Queen, we can save him.
[29:21.55]Yeah.
[29:22.63]With me out of the way, Queen is going to force Noelle to do her bidding.
[29:28.53]And if Noelle doesn't want to, she might make her face into a robot one.
[29:38.84]Susie, would you assist me in saving Noelle?
[29:46.82]Me?
[29:48.24]I just can't do it by myself.
[29:52.03]But if you can help me, I have a plan.
[29:55.21]A plan?
[29:56.47]I remember from Queen's tour of this place.
[29:58.75]There's a secret shortcut on the third floor.
[30:01.95]While Chris is distracting Queen, Susie will take the shortcut to reach Noelle and transfer her to me on the roof.
[30:09.64]From there, I'll bring her to a safe hiding spot.
[30:14.84]And together we can all defeat the Queen!
[30:18.83]All right, sure, we'll give it a shot.
[30:22.86]Most excellent there.
[30:26.71]See you on the roof, fellow agent.
[30:33.13]All right, let's go.
[30:33.81]Did you take that off already?
[30:39.78]Sorry.
[30:43.95]That's, like, sad.
[30:45.69]We just have to leave him here?
[30:47.34]Whoa.
[30:49.00]Whoa, wait.
[30:51.90]That's like an Easter egg.
[30:52.94]What if I move him all the way?
[31:06.68]What?
[31:08.15]He seems to be well taken care of.
[31:13.83]Is this spaghetti?
[31:14.57]Is that spaghetti?
[31:30.57]Oh shit, this is just- okay.
[31:31.39]We're gonna be- wait, what?
[31:35.16]We're gonna have these legs?
[31:36.04]There's a pair of legs.
[31:44.80]I think that- I think this, like, bathroom's on fire.
[31:50.72]It's a door.
[31:51.52]Where will you go?
[31:52.28]Oh, fuck.
[31:54.82]Okay, hold on.
[32:00.71]It's a cyber thing.
[32:02.17]There's a book here about shortcuts that open up later.
[32:05.75]The cybernetic bookshelf.
[32:13.38]Welcome to Color Cafe.
[32:14.92]Let us warm your day.
[32:17.92]Talk about yourself.
[32:19.68]Ah, forgive me for not introducing myself sooner, young masters.
[32:23.37]I am Swatch, our Lady Grace's head butler.
[32:26.59]When we are not attending to her needs, I and the Queen's others down, use this room as our humble yet colorful gift shop slash cafe.
[32:34.30]Please, shop to your heart's content.
[32:36.64]We are eager to serve you any dish.
[32:41.58]Does a woman of Our Lady Grace's caliber not deserve a coven of powerful men and women to dote upon her every movement?
[32:49.10]To have rap anthems written to her kindness?
[32:53.17]which are then bit crushed beyond recognition to make them more computer?
[32:56.96]To have melons smashed with karate chops repeatedly for no apparent reason?
[33:03.30]To have barrels thrown from the rafters and make us smash them all with karate chops before the timer runs out?
[33:10.27]The barrels are full of melons and we have to smash those too?
[33:13.99]Yes, the answer is yes.
[33:21.40]I'm afraid I am not familiar with a guest of that moniker.
[33:26.01]Ah, wait, are you by chance referring to that unbearable, unique man who barged in here and demanded to be made butler supremeth?
[33:33.05]I'm afraid that that person is now banned from this establishment.
[33:37.72]He may have suffered injuries as a result of his rather swift ejection.
[33:42.84]Please do not mention him again.
[33:43.88]We're still cleaning up the worms he left on the floor.
[33:49.67]Outfit.
[33:51.14]Ah, my outfit.
[33:51.64]Yes, the monochrome look is quite suitable, isn't it?
[33:54.72]Black suit, colored glasses.
[33:56.18]Many people have failed to imitate this look.
[33:59.62]I'm even going so far as to attempt to impersonate me in order to get the... Never mind.
[34:09.32]It's rules.
[34:10.44]No, it's Roxas!
[34:15.70]It's Roxas!
[34:26.69]Yeah, it's the Peter Griffin thing again.
[34:27.77]I'm out.
[34:30.87]Butt juice.
[34:41.38]Oh, God.
[34:41.82]100 HP for butt juice.
[34:43.32]What about spaghetti code?
[34:45.64]You're insane.
[34:49.18]Not.
[34:49.74]30 HP.
[34:51.38]Why is this $180?
[34:59.74]G-Shot Bowtie.
[35:01.00]Ooh.
[35:03.22]Royal Pin.
[35:04.02]Ooh.
[35:07.94]Oh, it's an Everybody Heal.
[35:09.06]Okay.
[35:10.76]It's a Party Heal.
[35:12.34]Oh, it's just Party.
[35:14.22]Alright, I'm gonna get a Bowtie.
[35:18.87]Or should I get the Royal Pin?
[35:20.05]Alright, I'm getting the Royal Pin.
[35:22.69]This is probably... This is expensive.
[35:23.85]That's two armor.
[35:31.18]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[35:34.62]Can I sell?
[35:35.40]Sell weapons?
[35:36.08]No.
[35:36.44]Sell armor?
[35:37.82]Oh wait, I can sell the stupid mannequin.
[35:42.29]Should I keep the mannequin for like crafting or something?
[35:44.61]Should I never sell anything?
[35:47.31]Whoa.
[35:49.15]Dog dollar.
[35:51.61]Should I sell the dog dollar?
[36:00.21]Old.
[36:01.23]Okay.
[36:03.15]Alright, that's enough.
[36:07.11]Old.
[36:12.39]Okay, I wanna go visit, yeah, I wanna go visit the trash guy.
[36:19.80]Trash zone.
[36:25.76]It's an eggplant that looks like a trash bag.
[36:29.97]Funny little guy was looking for you to the west.
[36:33.27]He was muttering something about deals.
[36:36.65]I know what that way is.
[36:52.26]Door is unlocked.
[36:52.96]I'm going in.
[36:59.91]What, you want to go in by yourself?
[37:02.17]Whatever, do what you want.
[37:06.74]Hey, it's me, Spamton G. Spamton.
[37:13.46]Let's make a deal.
[37:17.03]Okay, about you.
[37:19.01]I used to be another nobody email guy, and now I'm the, ow, it burns, help me, ow, I'm the it burns guy.
[37:26.90]I'm amazed at this amazing transformation.
[37:28.34]You too can have communion with... Soon I'll even surpass that damned clown.
[37:35.61]Clown around town.
[37:36.13]A clown in a town.
[37:38.49]But unlike him, I'm going to shoot for the sky.
[37:41.13]Get down the path to the big one.
[37:44.45]I'll get... I'll get... I'll get... Speaking of communion...
[37:54.93]Chris, did you know that there's a night?
[37:57.23]No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[37:58.61]I didn't mean to.
[38:00.27]Too many excess vacation days take a goddamn vacation straight to hell.
[38:08.98]Friends?
[38:11.28]Me?
[38:13.06]Friends?
[38:13.46]Chris, you and me, our already friend request has been accepted.
[38:19.75]We don't need anyone else.
[38:20.97]We don't need easels or CRTs.
[38:25.01]We don't need any man, woman, or child at half price.
[38:28.07]We don't need... Mike!
[38:28.97]Mike!
[38:33.28]Chris!
[38:34.08]Don't believe anything you see on TV.
[38:35.46]The man's a criminal, I tell you, a criminal!
[38:37.96]Did it again?
[38:42.80]No.
[38:54.18]Okay, what about our deal?
[38:57.08]Chris, you little sponge.
[38:59.38]I knew you'd come here on a Saturday night.
[39:02.04]After all, you want to be a big shot.
[39:06.44]But how?
[39:07.10]How can you be?
[39:08.50]Listen, listen, listen to me.
[39:11.94]In the deep abyss of Queen's Mansion, a great deal is waiting for a limited time only, a limited time only, a heaven-piercing workout-ready body.
[39:20.49]Signed by the classics.
[39:21.81]You've come to expect.
[39:22.61]Only in 1997.
[39:23.03]Copyright.
[39:23.47]We're going to make sure we put that there.
[39:25.88]First, that little nipper is our one-way ticket to make you big.
[39:31.02]Make it me big.
[39:33.10]Before you know it, we will be taking a ride around town in our special curangadero.
[39:40.90]Vacationing in burning acid while you soak in the hybrid.
[39:45.45]But Chris, don't breathe yet.
[39:46.65]The way is locked by high-quality encryption.
[39:50.11]You will never get inside.
[39:51.90]Wait, Chris, look!
[39:52.62]Here!
[39:52.94]Those balloons!
[39:54.06]Are you the 1000th customer?
[39:56.54]As a commemorative ring, I will let you buy Keygen from me at the low, low price.
[40:01.66]What do you think?
[40:02.72]It's such a steal.
[40:03.78]I'm... I'm... I'm... Myself.
[40:06.97]I'm shitting myself.
[40:08.95]Take this deal and you will die.
[40:10.49]It's that good.
[40:12.43]Buy the Keygen from me, unlock the basement, and get that empty disc.
[40:20.48]Okay.
[40:22.36]Fear.
[40:23.76]What are you afraid of?
[40:25.48]According to Encyclopedia of Being Afraid, there's nothing to fear except... Can anyone hear me?
[40:37.73]Help.
[40:39.21]Help.
[40:40.53]Ah, what?
[40:40.95]No, I didn't hear anything just now.
[40:43.43]But it sounded kind of like they were talking to you.
[40:52.87]Buy key gen from me and go to Queen's Mansion.
[40:57.27]How do I get the key gen?
[41:00.93]What?
[41:01.15]Go by myself?
[41:01.75]Chris?
[41:02.11]No!
[41:02.47]The men inside?
[41:03.11]The men inside would... How do I buy it?
[41:11.44]He just said buy.
[41:26.28]Exit and buy more.
[41:29.06]Oh fuck, I've been talking to him the whole time.
[41:30.58]Okay.
[41:32.10]Buy.
[41:32.38]Hurry up and buy.
[41:36.09]For a second I thought that was the menu.
[41:37.49]Okay.
[41:37.97]Buy.
[41:38.45]Buy more.
[41:42.15]What the fuck?
[41:45.62]HeGen S Potion.
[41:48.72]The big one.
[41:49.82]V-Shot Bowtie or Runaway.
[41:51.86]This is supposed to be like a market?
[41:56.10]I have to catch this when it's 30 bucks?
[42:00.16]Oh my god.
[42:01.06]Oh!
[42:01.12]I got it for 7 bucks!
[42:20.30]Item, item, affects HP a lot.
[42:22.36]Okay, can I get this one too?
[42:23.18]80, alright, that's fine.
[42:27.72]What about the... What the fuck?
[42:31.58]The big one.
[42:32.76]Cut anything in two pieces, criminal.
[42:45.33]Oh, wait, I don't have to actually accept it.
[42:48.76]Oh, well, okay.
[42:50.08]I thought it was like you had to click it and it just bought it.
[42:56.12]I'll take it, uh... Can I buy these?
[43:09.33]Can I buy- Okay, I got two.
[43:14.57]Can I get more of these potions?
[43:19.23]Stop, stop, scam, scam, scam, scam.
[43:21.17]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop getting scammed.
[43:22.47]What are you talking about?
[43:23.17]Alright, run away.
[43:25.39]Buy.
[43:26.63]You're buying weapons.
[43:30.09]Oh.
[43:35.35]Get more potions.
[43:36.41]Should I?
[43:36.67]Okay.
[43:40.80]Talking.
[43:42.04]Friends.
[43:42.34]Yeah, I think we're good.
[43:47.50]Buy more.
[43:48.18]Okay, let's go.
[43:49.34]Exit and buy more, and then escape.
[43:54.88]Mansion!
[43:56.04]Pavement!
[43:56.54]Find it!
[44:13.39]What creepy stuff were you buying anyway?
[44:15.70]Ah, like I even want to know.
[44:16.64]Yikes.
[44:18.10]She said she hoped if it was candy, you'd share with her.
[44:21.26]Shut up.
[44:23.66]Chris?
[44:26.08]What was it?
[44:31.71]Braided bow tie.
[44:33.19]Oh, it just goes down.
[44:35.01]Oh, what the fuck?
[44:40.95]Poison.
[44:45.19]Oops.
[44:47.57]Well, I have the key, right?
[44:48.59]So I can go to the basement in the mansion?
[45:01.28]Funny little guy was looking for you.
[45:02.38]Yep.
[45:06.86]Okay, so, um, let's go back to the... Back to the mansion.
[45:12.95]I wonder if I can go in another door now.
[45:20.88]Alright, I'm just gonna sell this junk.
[45:22.14]Or maybe I shouldn't.
[45:22.92]I might need it.
[45:24.01]Alright, I need the basement of the mansion.
[45:35.09]Let's go this way.
[45:45.16]I see you have escaped from your room, unit!
[45:48.85]Who can blame you for wanting to see my glorious mansion?
[45:52.69]You won't want to take your eyes off this beautiful art.
[45:54.81]We're not here to look at your stupid pictures.
[45:57.81]That was not a recommendation.
[46:00.79]I was just warning you.
[46:01.85]Laugh at my asshopper!
[46:06.84]Oh fuck.
[46:08.48]Oh my goodness.
[46:16.20]Go down first.
[46:22.15]What's that?
[46:23.49]What's that?
[46:24.57]Basement.
[46:26.85]Wait, what?
[46:31.48]Wait.
[46:31.62]Did that do anything?
[46:40.82]Oh, shit.
[46:44.59]Ooh.
[46:46.53]Found a revivement.
[46:57.44]Hey, I thought it was going to be lower than that.
[46:58.82]Okay, nothing else.
[47:05.50]All right, let's go.
[47:10.57]Now I know you are all loving my mansion.
[47:13.47]We have a few rules around here you have to follow.
[47:16.27]One, wipe your shoes.
[47:17.47]Two, have fun.
[47:18.67]Three, respect the pottery.
[47:20.79]Four, have fun.
[47:22.35]Five, missed entry duplication error.
[47:24.46]All right.
[47:28.29]I was trying to talk- I was trying to hang out with it!
[47:32.11]What the fuck?
[47:32.61]Okay, so what do we got?
[47:39.10]Warmify.
[47:40.18]Coldify.
[47:40.84]Bluer two stages.
[47:46.26]Redder two stages.
[47:47.30]Should I coldify the red?
[47:53.37]And then we're gonna see what this does.
[47:58.74]Half cold.
[48:00.56]Ah, we're going to see what this does.
[48:01.48]What does this do?
[48:03.02]Talked about the crunch of the last pickle in the refrigerator.
[48:05.64]Okay, so now it's watching the color turn a lot colder.
[48:09.46]It's now yellow.
[48:09.98]Alright, so now they both match.
[48:15.40]Wait, there's candy in that one.
[48:16.28]Oh, goddammit, I want the candy.
[48:32.28]Oh, super wrong.
[48:33.73]Pottery not respected.
[48:35.05]I mean, I was trying to just see what it was.
[48:39.69]See what it was.
[48:40.63]All right, so just don't break the pottery.
[48:42.29]But I kind of want to break the pottery.
[48:45.07]Oh, because I want to recruit those guys.
[48:47.02]Oh, they're just here anyways.
[48:51.56]Okay.
[48:57.24]All right.
[48:57.92]We need to warmify blue.
[49:01.36]And we need to... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[49:04.49]We need to... Coldify you.
[49:08.51]We need to half-warm you.
[49:11.69]And then we're gonna defend with you.
[49:13.83]No!
[49:14.59]They don't have to be... Oh, yeah, they have to be yellow.
[49:16.63]Yeah, I got it right.
[49:17.17]They have to be yellow, right?
[49:34.20]What the fuck are you doing?
[49:35.72]Oh, they just have to be the same color.
[49:37.12]They don't have to all be yellow?
[49:39.88]Oh, I thought it was like blue was going to be tired, yellow was spare.
[49:43.42]Oh, they just have to be the same color.
[49:46.24]Okay.
[49:46.74]I thought it was like they had to be yellow.
[49:48.32]It's like that's how you spare.
[49:49.94]I don't know.
[49:50.42]I don't know.
[49:50.88]That's a Toby Fox game.
[49:51.94]It could be anything.
[49:52.58]All right, let's go.
[49:58.14]So now I have to do warmify.
[50:01.53]Let's just make them all yellow.
[50:03.53]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[50:04.67]Coldify you.
[50:06.60]Warmify you.
[50:08.56]And then you spare you.
[50:12.80]This will do it.
[50:16.38]Hello.
[50:18.96]Hello.
[50:20.47]Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[50:21.79]That was a voice crack, but I saved it.
[50:29.01]Anti.
[50:29.21]Got him.
[50:36.61]Alright, now we just spare.
[50:42.86]Forty-five, nice.
[50:46.68]Three hundred twenty-eight dollars.
[50:48.76]Gotta check every window.
[51:02.81]Andy, Andy.
[51:05.54]Like, is this supposed to be a race?
[51:10.98]One.
[51:12.46]Two, three, four.
[51:13.24]Okay.
[51:14.00]One.
[51:14.62]Painting is labeled Task.
[51:19.51]Painting is labeled Timberly.
[51:25.81]Painting is labeled Task.
[51:30.41]Painting is labeled Task.
[51:35.40]I don't get it.
[51:35.80]Is this person's name Timberley?
[51:46.36]Timberley.
[51:53.29]All right.
[51:53.69]I'm not going to remember this.
[51:54.53]Task.
[51:55.77]Spelled correctly.
[51:57.37]Task.
[51:58.53]Timberley.
[52:00.30]Task with a Q. Task, Timberley, task.
[52:05.07]Task.
[52:06.39]Task, Timberley, task, task.
[52:10.55]Got it.
[52:12.81]Just in time for your appointment.
[52:14.39]Would you assist in organizing these paintings?
[52:17.11]Yes.
[52:18.71]I'll refine.
[52:19.96]Then the first question.
[52:22.08]Which painting's name is first alphabetically?
[52:25.80]Oh, fuck.
[52:27.40]Task.
[52:29.24]Okay.
[52:29.44]Task.
[52:30.49]Ask.
[52:31.35]T-A.
[52:32.97]D-A-S.
[52:34.57]D-A-S-K.
[52:36.78]Timberley is T-I.
[52:37.86]I. So K is above that.
[52:41.72]Q. Alright, the four.
[52:44.14]Wait.
[52:45.24]Number four.
[52:46.06]How do I say four?
[52:46.76]Number four was tasked with Q. The left painting is four.
[52:51.22]Why is it not... It's four.
[52:54.80]How refined.
[52:56.04]And the next question.
[52:57.48]Which painting's name is third alphabetically?
[53:01.23]Okay, that would be, so, uh, K, task with a K, task with a Q, task with a C, was that one?
[53:12.17]Wait, what was the question?
[53:14.74]That would be Timberley, and then task with a K at the bottom.
[53:16.90]Oh, we're fine.
[53:18.52]Then, the next question.
[53:19.90]Which painting is fourth?
[53:22.58]Task, Timberley, task, task.
[53:27.54]Left.
[53:29.40]Left.
[53:32.54]That's correct.
[53:33.58]I'm so happy I could whip something.
[53:38.18]Task Manager blocks the way.
[53:39.76]I can already spare Task Manager?
[53:44.77]Really?
[53:46.29]Holy shit.
[53:47.97]Yeah, let's go.
[53:56.79]Oh, yeah.
[54:00.50]Whoa!
[54:03.95]It's because you got them all right.
[54:04.95]Oh, okay.
[54:08.40]Nice.
[54:10.40]Alright.
[54:13.98]Second floor.
[54:14.80]Oh, wait.
[54:15.14]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:17.46]Not doing that yet.
[54:19.43]Three, two, throw.
[54:25.23]Oh, I can't walk through that?
[54:26.21]Huh?
[54:27.01]Huh?
[54:37.32]Oh, shit.
[54:40.05]Why?
[54:46.09]Oh, it's the hacker!
[54:57.67]Hacker!
[54:58.31]Oh my god, guys, a hacker!
[55:00.06]Hacker!
[55:02.14]Became lost in the craftsmanship.
[55:09.06]Chainmail.
[55:10.28]Secret backdoor.
[55:10.88]He became lost in the craftsmanship.
[55:36.73]Did his head just... his head's an arrow.
[55:40.43]Is he like pointing to it?
[55:44.10]Is he like pointing up?
[55:45.00]He's like pointing his finger up.
[55:48.52]Yeah, okay, I got it.
[55:53.80]Secret switch.
[55:57.08]I was wondering, I thought I was seeing things.
[55:59.22]His head like turned into a pointer.
[56:16.94]I thought I was seeing things.
[56:18.04]Switch.
[56:19.94]Whoa.
[56:21.66]You walked past it?
[56:22.44]What'd I do?
[56:22.74]Come on.
[56:26.24]What?
[56:29.62]Where is it?
[56:30.73]What is it?
[56:32.55]You got it.
[56:32.93]What are you talking about?
[56:33.87]You're fine.
[56:34.27]Yeah, what?
[56:37.55]You guys need to relax.
[56:38.97]And stop it.
[56:41.39]Oh, this is a secret entrance.
[56:51.80]Okay, so then what does this do?
[56:57.20]First use the key... Oh!
[56:59.58]This is the secret!
[57:01.00]I found it!
[57:02.71]I got it!
[57:05.83]The key gen just went in there.
[57:07.15]We're going to the... First, you want us to stay here?
[57:11.03]Sure, whatever.
[57:12.45]Me and Ralsei will have fun without you.
[57:17.71]Oh, shit.
[57:33.80]God.
[57:51.01]Hey.
[57:56.86]There's nothing in there.
[57:57.98]Wait a minute.
[58:02.66]Cane mail.
[58:05.22]the chainmail on and the... Whoa, why is frayed bow tie better?
[58:10.44]What?
[58:10.62]I'm sure I got enough shit on.
[58:31.42]Hey!
[58:32.72]Holy shit, I didn't think that was going to happen that quickly.
[58:36.41]One of these is fake.
[58:38.76]One, two, three, four.
[58:41.20]I'm closing my eyes and flipping a coin.
[58:42.94]Closing my eyes, flip a coin.
[58:43.70]Flip, flip, flip, flip.
[58:44.38]It's tails.
[58:46.78]You opened the treasure.
[58:47.40]Inside was one dark dollar.
[58:50.32]One dark dollar was added to your money hole.
[58:54.19]Got it.
[58:54.63]I was right.
[58:54.93]Okay.
[59:19.17]What's the deal?
[59:23.38]Oh shit, I can't leave.
[59:24.42]Oh no.
[59:33.57]I'm not spinning this.
[59:50.79]Okay.
[59:57.09]What's that?
[59:58.78]Sounds like a force field powering down.
[60:00.64]Follow the one upstairs.
[60:14.20]What the fuck?
[60:15.22]I wasn't ready for this shit.
[60:16.26]I'm using the controller.
[60:17.25]What the fuck?
[60:21.77]I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[60:23.09]I have the dumbass controller in my hand.
[60:25.52]I can't, you can't spin with the controller.
[60:30.85]Okay, I'm gonna have to use the key.
[60:32.41]What am I gonna do with that one?
[60:33.37]D-pad?
[60:50.57]No, I'm gonna use the probably keypad.
[60:53.99]Arrow keys.
[60:55.35]Alright, let's go.
[60:55.95]Arrow keys.
[60:56.29]Alright, I'm ready.
[60:58.49]Arrow keys.
[60:59.53]Go.
[61:09.55]Holy shit, this is fucking hard.
[61:10.89]Alright, let's go for it.
[61:18.33]I'm trapped here until I get out.
[61:36.22]Okay, I gotta get it down.
[61:55.92]Fuck.
[61:56.92]Fuck.
[61:58.04]It's like the... You know what it is?
[62:00.12]It's like the wrapping thing for my brain.
[62:03.06]I don't know why.
[62:04.19]Okay, if anybody else feels like this, you tell me if I'm accurate, right?
[62:08.81]I don't know why when it comes to things that spin, it inverts itself in my brain.
[62:15.81]If I have to scrap around left to get to right, it's almost like I have to go right to get to left.
[62:21.06]It's reversed in my brain.
[62:26.49]Same, same.
[62:27.03]Yeah, same.
[62:27.75]Yeah, no, thanks.
[62:28.41]That was a good effort.
[62:33.01]Will he beat the teacup wheel this time?
[62:37.81]Um... Do I have to... I'm going to wait for the prediction to be in?
[62:40.87]Okay.
[62:45.52]It's the shadows.
[62:46.24]Yeah, I know.
[62:47.74]It's just... Look, my brain's got a... My brain... I don't know why I said it like that.
[62:54.08]Will I beat the teacup this round?
[62:55.52]Okay.
[62:55.62]Okay.
[62:57.79]And let's go.
[63:09.49]Fucking hell!
[63:12.23]It's the going left and right.
[63:14.19]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[63:15.97]It's like the rotating motion.
[63:18.09]It's not left and right.
[63:19.23]It's like wrapping.
[63:21.67]I almost think I should just go one direction.
[63:29.13]I'm trying to look at the shadows on the ground, but when I go, oh, I have to go left.
[63:33.31]But where I currently am, I could go right around and get there faster.
[63:38.13]But you have to go left.
[63:40.79]I hate circles.
[63:41.87]I don't like rotating.
[63:46.41]Alright, these predictions are not going to happen as fast as these attempts are going to be.
[63:50.56]I'm going.
[64:08.23]What the fuck?
[64:15.34]I did!
[64:19.54]Oh, I feel bad for people that bet last time.
[64:21.04]It's not over yet, though.
[64:33.79]If I die here, I'm gonna stop... I need to take an item.
[64:38.05]I don't care.
[64:42.03]I almost ate the poison.
[64:56.76]What?
[65:24.35]I'll give you a good one.
[65:24.97]I'm going to give you a really good one.
[65:26.05]Ready?
[65:27.25]I feel like kind of prepare for it and it's got to be like pressure.
[65:30.15]The thing to do the MonkaS very well.
[65:32.09]Yeah, it's a lot of pressure in your like upper throat.
[65:40.64]No, that was bad.
[65:41.26]There we go.
[65:48.08]I have this like poison in my inventory.
[65:49.75]I don't have any.
[65:50.81]I have nothing.
[65:53.88]Alright, revive mint, the cookie.
[65:56.68]Ooh, spaghetti, 30 HP.
[65:58.99]No, I need more items.
[66:00.55]Can I buy something for somebody?
[66:01.53]Should I just do try this, but there's no items or something?
[66:04.45]I'm gonna lose.
[66:06.41]There's gonna be like a secret fight back here.
[66:08.27]It's gonna be like Jevil 2, and I'm gonna lose instantly.
[66:34.77]Go back to the shop.
[66:35.41]I think I'm going to go back to the shop.
[66:38.54]Yeah, I'm going back to the shop.
[66:43.02]I'm going to stock up on heals.
[66:44.94]I'm going to do the thing I do in every single RPG.
[66:47.56]Well, I don't have a party, but... So every time I played an RPG, I was so bad at them.
[66:52.42]It was terrible.
[66:54.24]I would just... It took me probably like a few years, maybe like five to ten years after playing a lot of RPGs for SNES.
[67:01.06]No, no.
[67:01.46]What?
[67:01.58]What are you doing?
[67:02.12]What are you doing?
[67:02.50]What?
[67:02.64]Backseat, backseat, chat, chill.
[67:03.89]What are you talking about?
[67:05.86]Stop him.
[67:06.32]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[67:09.11]Do I close this out if I go up?
[67:12.45]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[67:13.97]Am I gonna luck it up if I go up?
[67:15.74]Alright, well, whatever.
[67:16.32]Fine.
[67:18.34]Um...
[67:21.58]So anyways, I would be so bad at these games that I would fill my entire inventory with the revive whatever it was in the game.
[67:30.35]Whether it was a revive juice or a like cure that brought the person back to life, people would just die and I would do revive on them.
[67:38.31]I wouldn't even try to heal them.
[67:40.39]I think at some point, like when I played like Mario RPG, I'd have like 80% pick-me-ups were in my inventory and nothing else.
[67:47.77]I wouldn't even use mushrooms or heals or anything.
[67:55.01]So I just, like, didn't get it.
[67:55.95]Oh, the backseaters are getting backseated.
[68:00.08]Oh, shit.
[68:03.24]That's a level I didn't think we'd reach today.
[68:06.08]The backseaters in chat are being backseated by people backseating them.
[68:13.02]Huh?
[68:20.05]There's nothing interesting.
[68:21.95]There's nothing interesting.
[68:23.89]There's nothing interesting.
[68:26.56]Nothing?
[68:26.82]Nothing?
[68:28.23]There's gonna be a screamer in one of these.
[68:46.22]There's something shining inside the old machine.
[68:48.36]Do you take it?
[68:50.73]Yes.
[68:52.11]The empty disk was added to your key items.
[68:55.34]Oh, I got the disk.
[68:56.52]I got the disk.
[68:57.02]I got it.
[68:57.34]I got it.
[68:57.63]I got it.
[68:57.85]It comes to Indiana Jones part.
[69:26.69]Empty disk.
[69:27.27]A data disk from a strange machine.
[69:28.95]Didn't someone want this?
[69:30.14]I'm gonna bring it back.
[69:33.56]Oh god, this is gonna get weird.
[69:34.84]Come on, sissy!
[69:54.79]Give me my glasses back!
[69:57.27]Oh, look at me.
[69:58.03]Oh, look at me.
[69:58.77]Look at me.
[69:59.19]I'm a big dweeb that loves homework.
[70:03.68]Come on.
[70:06.08]Fine, take them back.
[70:08.50]Thank you.
[70:09.68]Oh, Chris, everything okay?
[70:13.13]Yes.
[70:14.35]Whatever, let's go.
[70:14.85]All right, cool.
[70:17.51]I got the data disk.
[70:19.83]I got the data disk.
[70:26.84]Cafe?
[70:28.64]Welcome to the cafe.
[70:29.50]Alright, so we've got butt juice.
[70:30.70]100 HP.
[70:30.84]I'm gonna buy like a shitload of these.
[70:32.68]Is that too many?
[70:39.05]I don't know.
[70:41.47]I'm playing this like I play every RPG.
[70:42.75]I just buy a shitload of them.
[70:47.08]I'm buying another one.
[71:00.26]Okay, get this.
[71:01.62]What do I want?
[71:02.02]The Lancer Cookie.
[71:03.00]Heals one.
[71:03.54]Maybe I should keep it.
[71:10.10]The Lancer Cookie.
[71:10.76]I'm getting rid of this.
[71:11.55]Revivement.
[71:14.85]Spaghetti.
[71:15.41]Yeah, this is 30 HP.
[71:16.49]30 HP.
[71:16.83]This is revive.
[71:17.55]I don't think I want this.
[71:21.67]I want... Yeah, I want heals.
[71:30.17]Alright, I just have my full inventory of healing.
[71:33.09]T is a heal.
[71:33.81]It heals more in battle.
[71:40.29]Well, we're gonna try it like this.
[71:41.43]Because if this is like a big fight that I'm doing, I'm going for it.
[71:48.90]Let's go bring it to him and see what happens here.
[71:51.60]I have a feeling he's gonna freak out.
[72:06.07]I'm gonna give him the data disk and he's gonna be like... All of a sudden, you can start hearing like... That's how you know, like, here it comes.
[72:13.23]Like, Toby Fox is gonna give you a banger.
[72:16.18]I'm gonna go in the inventory.
[72:17.96]Here it comes.
[72:18.56]I'm gonna put it into... Oh, yeah, you brought the disk?
[72:21.34]Enter.
[72:21.86]Buy.
[72:27.76]Oh, you should have done that!
[72:30.66]Hey, everyone, it's me.
[72:35.50]Okay, talking.
[72:36.60]Give disk.
[72:37.56]Okay, well, I have it saved, so this is a bad idea.
[72:43.01]We'll see what happens.
[72:45.47]There we go.
[72:46.31]Give disk.
[72:48.35]Chris, you did it.
[72:49.63]You, wee, a little wormy.
[72:51.93]You brought me the disk.
[72:53.91]Oh, gee, mama, I can feel that smooth taste already.
[72:57.59]Now, Chris, don't be greedy.
[72:58.65]Hand it over.
[72:58.99]Give me the disk.
[73:00.21]Then we will transfer my...
[73:05.32]Then, Chris, after this very, very important, go back and put the disc back where you got it.
[73:11.62]Do that, and you have my special guarantee I will pass my savings on to you.
[73:17.77]Every big, every shot, every, ah, all yours, Chris.
[73:23.01]So what do you say, big shot?
[73:25.88]Warning, if you consent to the terms and agreements, our store is permanently closing down.
[73:36.47]Finally, I knew you would.
[73:40.13]Chris, here I go.
[73:41.43]Begin the... Oh.
[73:56.47]So he's in the disc.
[73:59.09]That was the worst noise.
[74:02.81]So wait, he's in the disc?
[74:09.69]You can feel it smiling in your hand.
[74:11.48]Now we go put this back in the machine.
[74:21.56]Throw the disc away.
[74:22.66]Okay, mansion.
[74:33.28]Save it.
[74:42.39]Okay.
[74:44.05]Put it back in here.
[74:47.05]And then, what?
[74:49.53]I'm alone, though.
[74:50.27]Wait a minute.
[74:53.81]If I'm alone down here and I have to fight him in this... I feel like I'm going to have to fight him.
[74:58.22]I feel like I don't want spaghetti code.
[75:04.42]I don't care.
[75:04.86]Whatever.
[75:05.20]Fuck it.
[75:26.59]Okay, here we go.
[75:32.77]There's a slot for a disc.
[75:34.25]Insert the loaded disc.
[75:35.87]Yes.
[75:37.24]Put the disc into the broken down mechanism.
[75:40.66]Nothing happened.
[75:44.94]Tapped the mechanism.
[75:46.64]Nothing happened.
[75:48.16]Shook the mechanism.
[75:49.34]You hit it.
[75:50.41]You kicked it.
[75:52.27]Nothing happened.
[76:09.67]I feel like I have to do this.
[76:15.01]Give me a sec.
[76:15.53]Put it in MonkaW mode, please.
[76:18.07]Give me one sec.
[76:20.57]I just want to do something very quickly.
[76:23.31]I feel like I'm going to have to put this on.
[76:27.67]Because it's going to be probably an interesting new voice I'm going to have to do.
[76:38.97]Let's go ahead and check it out.
[76:40.07]Let's see if that's how this sounds.
[76:44.19]Let's see how much better.
[76:45.73]How does that sound?
[76:48.23]Oh, yes, we are the guy in that fucking machine.
[76:51.27]He's going to be a robot.
[76:56.58]That's just a guarantee.
[76:57.54]It's literally a guarantee.
[76:59.52]There's no way he's not a robot, right?
[77:04.92]Right, yeah.
[77:06.48]Let's do, let's go with this one.
[77:08.36]This one sounds pretty good.
[77:09.76]I like this one.
[77:11.36]I like this one.
[77:11.86]How does this one sound?
[77:13.06]Does this one hurt your ears?
[77:14.34]It kind of hurts my ears.
[77:16.34]No?
[77:16.77]Yay?
[77:17.25]Nay?
[77:18.09]Which one?
[77:19.49]You can't hear it?
[77:23.47]Oh, I'm so excited.
[77:25.17]I can't believe it.
[77:26.09]I can't wait to tell you what I have in store for you.
[77:27.89]Hopefully it doesn't hurt your ears when I scream.
[77:34.63]Nay?
[77:35.33]She had a lot of nays.
[77:36.21]She had a lot of nays here.
[77:39.91]How's this one?
[77:41.41]I kind of like this one.
[77:43.17]Let's see.
[77:44.35]How's this?
[77:45.19]How's this?
[77:46.03]How's this?
[77:46.85]How's this one?
[77:47.99]Yeah, you like this one?
[77:49.45]Okay.
[77:51.50]So if we're going to do that, then we might as well get ready.
[77:54.54]Oh, how are you?
[77:55.36]How are you doing?
[77:56.44]It's so wonderful to see you.
[77:58.20]Okay, I'm ready to voice act.
[77:59.86]I'm ready to be a voice actor, for God's sake.
[78:04.04]This is normal?
[78:04.82]This is me.
[78:05.58]Here we are.
[78:06.12]How are you?
[78:06.82]Good to see you again, you little shit.
[78:09.24]Good to see you, you little shit.
[78:11.33]Okay.
[78:12.03]I'm ready.
[78:15.33]I gotta get in the mood to do this.
[78:22.48]I'm back.
[78:22.78]Alright, here we go.
[78:33.98]Oh, God.
[78:37.24]Holy Cucadero, do I feel good.
[78:43.67]Here I am, Chris.
[78:45.71]Big.
[78:46.11]Big.
[78:46.89]Bigger and better than ever.
[78:49.69]This power is freedom.
[78:52.63]I won't have to be just a puppet anymore.
[78:59.47]Or so I thought.
[79:01.17]Well, Miss Strange, why am I not big enough?
[79:04.79]It's too dark, it's too dark.
[79:07.97]Grasp.
[79:10.31]Grasp, grasp, grasp, grasp, grasp, grasp.
[79:11.97]That's right, you.
[79:13.24]I need you.
[79:15.28]Big.
[79:15.94]Grasp me.
[79:17.62]Very, very, very big.
[79:19.10]So big we'll stand tall and see past the dark.
[79:21.32]Stand up with our heads in the clouds and look into the light.
[79:27.51]I just need that little soul you have.
[79:32.61]Chris!
[79:36.99]What the hell was that weirdo?
[79:46.46]Chris, we were worried about you, so... Here it comes!
[80:01.86]What are we doing?
[80:02.66]What are we doing?
[80:04.02]Whoa!
[80:32.84]Oh shit, this is a shmup?
[80:35.90]This is a shmoop?
[80:39.94]It's a charge shot.
[80:41.22]Oh fuck.
[80:41.98]Okay, here we go.
[80:44.62]Chris, what was that big shot just now?
[80:47.95]Wow, I'm so proud of you.
[80:51.47]I could kill you.
[80:53.85]Heaven, are you watching?
[80:55.93]It's time to make a very special
[81:02.61]It's time to make a big shot.
[81:04.51]Let's go.
[81:08.23]Spamton Neo.
[81:10.49]Okay, snap, snap all.
[81:12.29]Let's try snap all.
[81:14.11]Everyone snap wires.
[81:17.11]Isn't this body just heavenly?
[81:19.61]This is a fucking banger.
[81:22.15]Gotta go up.
[81:23.96]Let's go.
[81:27.10]Three times the firepower, two times the water power, and best of all, flying head.
[81:36.34]Alright, get it.
[81:39.78]Hold and release B to fire a big shot.
[81:47.37]Get it.
[81:50.27]Uh, snap off.
[81:51.29]We'll turn those schmoes and daves into a rose and grape!
[81:57.67]Oh god.
[82:09.62]Bring it on.
[82:11.00]Come on!
[82:15.64]Don't you want to be part of my beautiful heart?
[82:18.14]Or did you need a little special toy?
[82:25.53]I probably shouldn't hit him.
[82:26.73]I don't know if I should be shooting him.
[82:30.12]Isn't that bad?
[82:31.96]I don't think I should shoot him.
[82:33.36]I don't want to shoot him.
[82:34.00]Stop shooting him.
[82:34.44]Alright, how are we doing on health?
[82:43.17]Okay, I'm going to use a spaghetti gun.
[82:44.39]Snap.
[82:48.95]Okay.
[82:57.04]All you gotta do is go big!
[83:03.16]Are you serious?
[83:04.86]It's for you!
[83:14.75]Ooh!
[83:14.97]Don't let him get in there.
[83:19.08]Alright, again.
[83:19.62]Snap off.
[83:24.86]That's calling, Chris.
[83:25.84]My heart, my hand.
[83:36.73]Good.
[83:37.65]Need another heal?
[83:38.09]No, I'm not.
[83:38.51]I'm good.
[83:38.93]Look at my eyes, look at my nose, look at my mouth.
[83:55.49]Gotta heal.
[84:01.03]Uh, we gotta do Buck Juice.
[84:02.95]On me.
[84:04.65]Everybody heal.
[84:14.78]Everybody take a Buck Juice.
[84:16.58]Act of Fault.
[84:18.36]Alright, we're good.
[84:20.14]Let's go.
[84:20.52]Come on.
[84:21.14]Let's go.
[84:21.68]Here we go.
[84:24.28]I can't stand it.
[84:44.83]Again.
[84:45.59]What do they have right now?
[84:47.69]Almost halfway there.
[84:48.41]Let's go.
[84:48.75]I got enough heals, I think.
[85:10.04]I gotta be careful here.
[85:14.90]Gonna heal after this.
[85:15.52]Alright, heal!
[85:28.30]Forgetting code.
[85:28.74]Forgetting code twice.
[85:39.29]go again all right only like four or five more times and that's it
[86:19.16]Alright, we're already down.
[86:23.14]Revive.
[86:23.54]Revive mid.
[86:26.13]On Susie.
[86:31.55]Let's go!
[86:56.83]Alright, I'm gonna climb.
[87:16.28]Pretty bad.
[87:16.78]80%, come on!
[87:18.44]Alright, so what do we got for health?
[87:21.51]Okay, here's what we're gonna do here.
[87:26.73]7, 14.
[87:27.35]Okay, let's go.
[87:29.93]I need to go.
[87:34.43]Where's Rousey?
[87:36.21]I'm going to revive Mint on Susie.
[87:39.25]And then Rousey is going to do a heal prayer.
[87:45.51]On Rousey.
[87:48.49]All right, let's go.
[87:52.51]F1 for health.
[87:53.41]Oh, shit.
[87:58.24]It's for me?
[87:58.82]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what's he doing?
[88:01.05]Is he healing?
[88:01.45]Smells like rotten glass.
[88:07.07]Get those fucking wires cut.
[88:09.87]Now!
[88:17.34]Oh, God.
[88:18.72]Oh, God.
[88:28.90]Woah!
[88:36.22]Woah!
[88:38.79]Stage lights are shattered!
[88:40.91]He's almost there!
[88:41.85]This is it!
[88:47.17]Snap it!
[88:48.79]He's right there!
[89:13.29]That's it.
[89:18.11]It's over.
[89:18.75]I win.
[89:20.77]That's it.
[89:23.67]Yeah.
[89:24.19]I'm going to snap the wire on him and then see you later.
[89:26.95]Spare.
[89:27.29]That's it.
[89:27.77]I win.
[89:34.13]Let me make sure it's actually going to work.
[89:36.72]Let's just make sure.
[89:39.22]That's it.
[89:40.58]Yeah.
[89:40.84]Game over.
[89:41.20]I win.
[89:41.36]Get out of here.
[89:50.40]Oh, I gotta keep it going.
[89:51.64]I gotta first try the secret bosses in every chapter, right?
[89:55.85]I have to.
[90:02.13]What?
[90:02.63]Oh, hold on.
[90:04.26]Wait.
[90:04.38]Fuck the presses.
[90:07.88]My wires are almost...
[90:20.95]All the unforgettable deals of the freak roper I gave you.
[90:24.51]You've finally re-revealed my generosity?
[90:27.73]Chris, I understand now who's the greatest deal of all.
[90:32.92]Friendship!
[90:33.88]Chris, my name is Long Nose Roller!
[90:36.24]Cut that wire and make me a real boy!
[90:38.56]Are you watching?
[90:40.46]Heaven, the X-File for Spadrum's contract special!
[90:42.56]And this time...
[90:58.57]Oh God, he's just dead.
[90:59.73]Oh my God.
[91:07.93]That's kind of sad.
[91:13.92]It seems, after all, I couldn't be anything more than a simple puppet.
[91:19.45]But you three, you're strong.
[91:22.71]With a power like that, maybe you three can break your own strings.
[91:28.67]Let me become your strength.
[91:36.02]You got Shadow Crystal.
[91:38.74]You got Dealmaker.
[91:42.72]Aww.
[91:44.72]I liked him.
[91:49.09]I actually like that guy a lot.
[91:53.14]Alright, what is it?
[91:53.56]So we've got... Dealmaker.
[91:58.58]Ooh.
[91:59.38]Fashionable pink and yellow glasses greatly increases money gained and a shitload of other stuff.
[92:11.42]We should probably... Rousey should probably have this, right?
[92:18.46]Yeah, give this to Rousey.
[92:23.64]What was the other thing?
[92:24.24]There was something else too.
[92:27.18]Wasn't there something else?
[92:34.81]Shadow crystal.
[92:35.81]A sharp shadow moves like water in the hand.
[92:38.59]You have collected one.
[92:45.54]Fun fact, if you beat him with a full inventory, he gets really pissed.
[92:52.57]You get the other one from Jevil.
[92:55.11]Aww.
[92:56.70]Well, I did do that.
[92:57.58]It's on a different computer.
[93:07.66]That was really cool.
[93:08.34]That was fun.
[93:09.80]That was a little intense.
[93:13.79]I'm setting myself up for a lot of defeat here.
[93:16.61]Because I can't just beat the secret boss, Andy, on first try.
[93:22.01]I mean, that's not going to happen three times in a row, right?
[93:24.07]Like, no way.
[93:25.27]I feel like I'm adding... I'm not going to be able to do that.
[93:29.05]I'm going to have to, though.
[93:30.92]I have to beat Nick 3-0.
[93:31.64]Okay.
[93:37.17]There's a save game editor for Chapter 2 and a Chapter 1 editor is in the works.
[93:41.21]You want to create a single PC save.
[93:42.89]Oh, okay.
[93:43.15]That's cool.
[93:46.57]Remember a pee break?
[93:47.23]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[93:47.72]Let's take a pee break.
[93:49.14]I'll be right back.
[93:51.44]And we'll continue on.
[93:52.94]See you in a second.
[95:34.10]Hey, what's up?
[95:34.66]I'm not back yet.
[95:35.56]I'm just letting you know I'm going to be another minute or two because I'm making a coffee.
[95:39.91]Back in like two more minutes.
[101:45.46]Okay, okay, okay.
[101:46.02]I'm back.
[101:46.34]I'm back.
[101:46.68]Sorry.
[101:48.29]I made a coffee and that led to me getting a snack.
[101:51.77]Which led to me having to like get that ready.
[101:54.21]Look, I'm sorry.
[101:58.53]Snack was very good though.
[102:02.67]It was... Do you guys have the Duke's sausages?
[102:08.55]They're very good.
[102:09.83]The chorizo and lime Duke's sausages.
[102:11.63]Holy moly.
[102:12.39]They're very, very good.
[102:15.37]Like the little, like, meat snacks.
[102:19.91]Highly recommend the chorizo and lime if you haven't had it.
[102:26.04]Oh, this is, yeah, this is scary music.
[102:27.58]I didn't even realize that.
[102:29.66]Okay.
[102:40.03]Uh, you guys can't see anything, but now you can.
[102:46.17]So let's go back this way that we came.
[102:48.87]Those are dog treats.
[102:52.96]What's going on?
[103:00.36]Hey, so are we seriously not gonna talk about any of that?
[103:04.90]It was goddamn weird.
[103:05.92]Puppets, strings, hands.
[103:08.05]What the hell does any of that mean?
[103:11.57]And the way he just broke.
[103:14.06]I don't think it meant anything, Susie.
[103:16.30]It seems like it was just a corrupted program.
[103:18.25]Yeah, I love these things.
[103:21.95]They're really crunchy.
[103:23.37]They're really small.
[103:24.27]They made it out of some kind of oat milk or something.
[103:26.85]They're called milk buns.
[103:29.02]They're in a weird part of the grocery store, though.
[103:30.54]They're in the dog aisle, the pet aisle.
[103:33.36]I don't know why.
[103:33.86]I don't know.
[103:35.86]They're very, very good.
[103:38.96]It turned into our allies.
[103:39.90]Let's just accept it.
[103:45.43]Chris, you've got goosebumps.
[103:47.67]You okay?
[103:55.53]I'm okay.
[103:56.22]If you say it all strained like that, I'm not gonna think you're okay.
[104:02.14]Hey, Rousey.
[104:03.06]You think Chris is okay?
[104:05.98]Hmm.
[104:06.56]Well, they seem a bit shocked, but... Chris doesn't want us to worry, so...
[104:13.87]Let's not push them for now.
[104:16.55]I'm alright.
[104:17.95]Chris, I'll make some cake for you later, okay?
[104:20.07]I could even make it chocolate-flavored.
[104:22.59]Butterscotch, cinnamon, whatever you want.
[104:24.11]Okay.
[104:29.47]Well, their stomach's rumbling, but the goosebumps aren't gone.
[104:35.42]Chris, if you're cold, you can share my scarf.
[104:39.02]Oh, yes.
[104:39.78]Every time I mispronounce a word, everyone has to talk about it.
[104:43.32]Whatever.
[104:45.18]I said siminin instead of siminin.
[104:48.72]It's very easy to do.
[104:51.50]Or, um, Susie could.
[104:53.60]What?
[104:53.84]No, hell, if I'm giving you my jacket.
[104:56.45]You make me cold, I'm burning you knuckleheads for warmth.
[105:01.75]Susie!
[105:03.75]Too late.
[105:04.35]Already imagining you guys as idiot-scented candles.
[105:09.63]You said it wrong?
[105:11.69]Sin...
[105:13.48]Cinnamon.
[105:15.52]Cinnamon.
[105:17.57]Cinnamon.
[105:18.33]What is it?
[105:19.09]It's cinnamon.
[105:21.79]Cinnamon.
[105:26.05]I'm saying, right?
[105:26.63]Cinnamon.
[105:38.62]Wait, why am I going that way when I can go this way?
[105:47.32]So, um... Where's progression?
[105:51.93]This way?
[105:53.91]I think progression was this way.
[105:55.01]Ow.
[105:55.85]You're gonna say... Aluminium.
[106:05.12]Aluminium.
[106:11.77]Hey!
[106:11.99]Hey!
[106:17.11]What if I do it first?
[106:17.71]I win.
[106:22.84]What's the score?
[106:47.06]Right.
[106:48.53]This stuff.
[106:49.27]Okay, the mouse did that.
[106:51.25]Alright, should I go to the second floor?
[106:53.03]What's over this way?
[106:53.81]I'm gonna go to the second floor.
[106:54.53]Yeah, let's go.
[107:06.09]Oh wait, I thought I was supposed to collect them.
[107:09.54]Whoops.
[107:10.40]It's me being a stupid dummy.
[107:11.66]Whoopsie.
[107:14.48]I wonder how many people turned the volume down and just, like, went to a different stream after that one.
[107:21.53]That's the hacker.
[107:21.99]You know, sometimes when I do that stuff, I hope that the person's putting me through a speaker, and somebody ends up walking in the room that doesn't know or doesn't care that they watch this channel, they might not know anything about me, and they hear that, and they just go, what are you, what the fuck is, who is that?
[107:45.80]Like, if I were to, for instance, go... Oh, whoopsie daisy, whoopsie doodly doodly!
[107:51.24]One of you... There's 11,000 people here.
[107:53.82]Somebody's, like, dad just came in or something.
[107:56.40]Somebody's, like, roommate just walked in.
[107:58.49]And now they just thought, like, what the fuck are you doing?
[108:01.93]There's 11,000 of you here.
[108:04.63]One of you just had a roommate walk in the door.
[108:15.01]Welcome to the second floor dinner party, section A. Please help yourself to anybody's food.
[108:21.72]Normally, I'm terrified of mice, but it's okay because that one is wearing a wig.
[108:25.40]Okay.
[108:29.65]Hey, it's me, the hacker.
[108:32.19]No one figured it out, but it's me.
[108:33.23]I've been on the download.
[108:35.25]That really happened to me.
[108:41.81]My roommate is here.
[108:47.44]Mouse?
[108:48.76]This guy keeps telling everyone at the party he's a hacker.
[108:51.76]I don't know what to do with this information.
[108:57.13]Yes, yes.
[108:57.67]Queen is right.
[108:58.33]Send error report.
[108:59.19]Send error report.
[109:03.67]Couldn't agree more.
[109:04.59]Send error report.
[109:05.49]Send error report.
[109:07.55]Hubert's moving up in the world.
[109:15.89]I am Mouse-a-billion.
[109:17.07]I stand leagues and inches above all the other mice.
[109:20.41]Only Newbert remains above me still.
[109:25.12]Eating a wig.
[109:34.36]Whoa.
[109:40.32]I win.
[109:49.79]Let's go this way first.
[109:57.19]First floor?
[109:57.89]No, we don't want that.
[109:58.88]Hey.
[110:07.66]What's the point of that?
[110:11.82]What's the point of that?
[110:16.10]Room has been closed due to kitchen vermin.
[110:20.88]Room has been closed to the kitchen.
[110:21.86]Okay.
[110:35.03]So we can only go... I guess I can go up.
[110:44.25]Oh me, oh my.
[110:45.05]The kitchen is infested with vermin.
[110:47.29]I knew we should have properly finished dumping all the cheese in that alleyway.
[110:52.30]Ouch, ouch.
[110:53.38]The mouse can't get me up here.
[110:55.40]Even if the... Ow, stove is burning my feet.
[111:00.16]M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mouse!
[111:02.91]And it's n-n-not wearing a wig!
[111:13.55]What the hell?
[111:16.07]Mouse wheel spins into you.
[111:22.97]Oh shit, Space Jam came out.
[111:26.28]Wait, did it?
[111:33.32]Did?
[111:33.52]I forgot.
[111:36.98]Did it come out a long time ago?
[111:38.71]It came out like a month ago.
[111:40.35]Oh, it did?
[111:40.71]Alright, let's catch X. Okay, let's... Oh my goodness.
[111:50.48]Ooh.
[111:52.10]Rolling around at the speed of mouse.
[111:56.84]That's cool.
[111:58.06]Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[112:03.58]What?
[112:06.89]Rickon don't... I don't even want to say that.
[112:14.51]Oh, that's weird.
[112:15.23]This is patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time.
[112:28.08]Alright, I got one more.
[112:29.16]I think this is the play here.
[112:35.18]Yeah, this is the play.
[112:38.83]We're on the edges.
[112:41.19]Big Chungus is in it.
[112:46.21]I hope that's not fake.
[112:47.81]I hope that's not a lie.
[112:50.59]Big Chungus is in it.
[112:53.97]Yeah, fucking right.
[112:56.62]the fuck?
[112:57.02]We'll take care of it from here.
[112:58.16]He's actually in it.
[113:03.40]No, he's not.
[113:05.32]Egg Chungus is not in the Space Jam movie.
[113:12.16]They're not lying for once.
[113:21.65]Thanks for the help.
[113:22.31]We'll open up the East Dining Hall now.
[113:26.17]Thank you.
[113:28.09]Look it up.
[113:28.59]I'm not looking it up.
[113:29.23]I don't care.
[113:30.41]I'm gonna... If I look it up, it's real.
[113:32.98]It's not real right now for me.
[113:34.34]If I look it up and I see it, it's real.
[113:35.94]It's not real for me.
[113:36.84]I'm sorry.
[113:44.40]East Dining Hall.
[113:47.92]Should we be this way?
[113:55.49]We need a stream reaction.
[113:57.53]No, I don't care.
[113:58.35]I feel like I'm trying to scan everything because I don't want to miss anything.
[114:13.50]It's locked.
[114:14.70]What's with this giant empty room anyway?
[114:17.10]Welcome to my extravagant dining potential.
[114:20.58]Dear.
[114:21.62]Only one of these delicious platters has the key.
[114:24.83]I am sure searching will be an addicting game of chance.
[114:27.71]How are we going to search all these?
[114:32.75]If I get it first try, then you have to give me 50,000 community subs.
[114:35.03]Oh.
[114:36.35]Oh well.
[114:46.10]Key not found.
[114:47.50]Did you mean give up?
[114:51.62]All the platters got mixed up again.
[114:56.54]I didn't say to the debt.
[114:57.50]I said I get 50,000 community subs.
[114:59.94]That was the only thing.
[115:01.89]There was nothing else for it.
[115:02.89]Alright, it's going to be this one.
[115:07.29]This one.
[115:08.79]There's something under this one.
[115:13.79]It's a dog!
[115:18.52]Hey, wait a second.
[115:30.98]What's going on?
[115:33.88]Oh.
[115:44.91]You win!
[115:46.09]Now we just have to... It broke it!
[115:52.03]What the fuck?
[115:57.17]Oh, that was awesome.
[116:00.37]Maybe minus the blatant destruction.
[116:02.57]Let's go, Chris.
[116:03.65]We're almost at the third floor.
[116:11.14]No!
[116:11.98]Where's my secret?
[116:13.14]Where's my funny joke that's supposed to be in here?
[116:18.78]Supreme table.
[116:20.86]You won't be able to use this without the throne of the gods.
[116:25.60]It's your cousin!
[116:27.24]Stop!
[116:28.54]That's not what I was doing.
[116:31.31]Okay, I can't sit at this unless I've thrown the gun.
[116:34.08]Why is it a giant, like, gerbil feeder?
[116:46.75]You caused him.
[116:48.65]Alright, so let's go.
[116:49.83]Let's cool.
[116:50.31]Let's cool down.
[116:50.97]Let's cool down this one.
[116:59.16]Holdify.
[117:00.88]And then we're going to... Whoa.
[117:03.12]No, we're not.
[117:04.58]We're not going to do that.
[117:05.88]Here's what we're going to do.
[117:06.68]What we're going to do is we're going to warmify this one.
[117:10.65]And then we're going to killify.
[117:11.85]All right.
[117:13.83]Is warm red?
[117:14.93]This would be warm this one.
[117:16.55]And then you spare this one.
[117:28.33]What do you mean, no?
[117:39.31]I got it!
[117:45.23]Are they dabbing?
[117:47.47]That's still a thing, people think.
[117:48.73]And you're not still doing that, right?
[117:51.53]Are you?
[118:15.56]Glow Shard.
[118:26.67]Where is it?
[118:29.87]Oh, it's here.
[118:31.15]Shimmering Shard.
[118:31.73]Its value increases each chapter.
[118:33.47]Damn.
[118:40.83]Um...
[118:53.05]Chow.
[118:55.35]Oh, God.
[118:55.85]Hey, hey.
[118:58.91]Chow.
[119:00.45]Chow.
[119:12.26]I thought I was supposed to collect them.
[119:13.32]They're blue.
[119:15.56]They're a different color.
[119:23.08]What was that?
[119:24.76]It's chocolate milk!
[119:37.34]Chris, Susan, glad to see you arrive unwounded.
[119:41.02]Now let us hasten.
[119:45.18]Through here is a secret passageway to the roof.
[119:48.70]There we can in-rescue-fy Lady Noelle.
[119:53.95]Um, okay.
[119:56.73]Let's go, Chris.
[120:00.11]Oh, Chris.
[120:01.25]Chris is... Chris, you and your lackey distract the queen.
[120:06.60]Let's go, Susie.
[120:08.10]Just the two of us.
[120:11.68]Fine, whatever.
[120:17.04]Chris, do you think of me as your lackey?
[120:20.10]No, of course not.
[120:21.73]You mean, you think of me as more than a lackey?
[120:26.63]Wait, what?
[120:27.59]Yes, I mean, what are you talking about?
[120:33.92]You're filled with the power of book holes.
[120:37.28]There's a book here about preventing backtracking.
[120:47.79]Alright, can I, is there, can I, what should I do?
[120:49.87]I'm gonna go this way first.
[120:53.29]What is this?
[120:55.73]The Knight created the fountain, and this world.
[120:59.20]It might be even more powerful than Queen.
[121:02.32]No.
[121:05.16]Queen has been very interested in this video recently, where the Knight creates the fountain by its own hand.
[121:11.42]Well, it's that and Cyber City's funniest home videos.
[121:18.39]This is today's dinner entertainment.
[121:19.95]I've heard it's called The Birth of a Fountain.
[121:23.19]What an elegant name.
[121:25.35]How eloquently soyotic.
[121:31.27]We are often forced to star in those videos.
[121:36.79]Or now.
[121:39.13]A video of someone creating a strange pillar of smoke.
[121:42.97]There's so much smoke, it's hard to tell who it is.
[121:58.94]The statue of Birdly is wedged in the toilet.
[122:01.54]You glance back at the bathroom door sign.
[122:04.26]The sign is a silhouette of a Birdly statue.
[122:07.65]Everything checks out.
[122:09.85]No problem here.
[122:13.99]Oh god, not this guy again.
[122:17.51]What are they gonna be done in there?
[122:26.44]A giant lake of acid?
[122:29.25]Oh, you mean the free pool.
[122:30.43]You will learn to love it like family.
[122:34.35]Why do you have this?
[122:35.19]It is my mansion's energy source and fun to drink.
[122:40.65]Bye.
[122:41.21]How should we pass this?
[122:56.39]I suppose this works.
[123:02.06]Now we have to think of a way to distract the queen.
[123:10.15]Oh, I'm so distracted right now!
[123:12.57]Can I like get out on that?
[123:13.49]No.
[123:13.93]Turning them blue.
[123:16.43]What are these little houses?
[123:29.20]Just tropical villains for my guest.
[123:31.06]Isn't that thoughtful?
[123:32.02]How would anybody fit inside?
[123:36.04]Shrink from the acid!
[123:38.88]Chris, get the banana!
[123:41.18]Chris isn't going to do what you say.
[123:42.46]Where's the banana?
[123:49.47]That's okay, Chris.
[123:50.39]It's good for you.
[123:58.33]Did I not turn the other one blue?
[124:03.58]Looks like we're coming up on a tunnel.
[124:05.32]Oh, I didn't turn the other one blue.
[124:07.88]How?
[124:08.22]I thought I could... I thought I'd just drive by them.
[124:10.18]There's something blocking the way.
[124:20.57]Maybe we can find some way to get rid of this.
[124:25.41]Giant hand.
[124:26.00]Okay.
[124:29.94]Okay, what's over here?
[124:34.26]Nothing.
[124:34.84]Oh shit.
[124:35.18]Um, okay.
[124:36.24]We're gonna be here a fucking long time.
[124:57.12]This castle looks like it has worn many sieges.
[125:06.04]Wait, you can just do this.
[125:10.85]Where's, what's it, wait, doesn't she have, oh no, that's mist rain or something, right?
[125:14.13]Wait, why do you know, you don't have it.
[125:16.49]Where's mist, healing mist?
[125:18.71]Oh shit, wrong person.
[125:23.35]That's Noelle.
[125:34.19]Oh, it wasn't yellow.
[125:37.49]Oh, that's right, pacify on the blue.
[125:38.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[125:46.81]It's been a while since I've had to pacify somebody.
[126:20.57]He's losing it.
[126:22.79]Okay, it seems that peace has returned to the castle.
[126:26.49]You opened and got a revived dust.
[126:29.17]Revived dust was added to your item inventory.
[126:34.34]I don't wanna!
[126:37.36]I don't wanna!
[126:49.78]I don't wanna wait
[127:20.27]Uh-oh!
[127:47.35]Let me just click off out of the window in a place that I'm not supposed to click.
[127:53.25]Let me just see if I can get over here on my fucking Mac.
[127:58.88]Let me just... Oh, whatever.
[128:02.36]I think my computer's frozen.
[128:04.14]How am I supposed to do this?
[128:17.44]How do I get that?
[128:20.92]Because I have to do this.
[128:21.76]Can I go up from here?
[128:25.44]No.
[128:25.62]How am I supposed to get this?
[128:26.62]Oh my god.
[128:27.70]What a dummy.
[128:29.28]What's that?
[128:46.99]You alright?
[128:48.83]Is this guy... Did I talk to this guy or is he going to fight me?
[128:55.39]Thank you for your help.
[128:56.88]I had gone up there to do a little housecleaning and got stuck.
[129:00.30]Thank you.
[129:04.26]Um...
[129:20.29]I suppose we'll just have to let it go this once.
[129:22.98]How do I connect?
[129:32.02]Um, okay.
[129:33.78]That it?
[129:45.33]I can't get over that way?
[129:47.09]Alright.
[129:50.55]He doesn't do anything
[130:02.41]I don't... I don't remember... I don't know how... I don't know.
[130:04.67]I don't know how to do it.
[130:06.57]No, I'm done.
[130:07.27]I'm done.
[130:07.75]I don't... I don't know how to... I'm done.
[130:10.24]Yeah, I'm fucking done.
[130:11.18]I'm done.
[130:11.48]Whatever.
[130:11.78]This game's like... whatever.
[130:13.46]It's like just fucking two artists and shit.
[130:14.84]It's stupid.
[130:16.06]No, I'm done.
[130:16.68]I'm done.
[130:17.25]That's done.
[130:18.53]I'm done.
[130:19.41]I don't want to do this.
[130:23.89]What about this over here?
[130:25.70]Gamer rage.
[130:26.54]Dear guests, please note our mice will turn at every crossing.
[130:30.90]Our vermin have been specifically handpicked for higher turning.
[130:37.59]Mice found $1.
[130:40.51]You didn't get any.
[130:42.05]What the fuck?
[130:47.20]No.
[130:48.10]I don't want to.
[130:52.40]No!
[130:52.80]They found $20!
[130:53.56]Sounds like the bridge was raised.
[131:01.27]Drop that.
[131:02.21]Ah, it's gonna clap.
[131:27.38]Looks like the hand is out of the way now.
[131:40.33]Let's go.
[131:46.41]Sound of progress, my friend.
[131:54.61]Chris.
[131:55.17]Hey, Chris.
[131:56.82]Is it strange to say it's nice spending time alone with you like this?
[132:06.37]Um... I like hanging out.
[132:11.85]I like spending time.
[132:14.62]But... I wouldn't say it's necessarily strange.
[132:18.50]What do you mean strange?
[132:19.12]Strange.
[132:28.67]I like hanging out.
[132:32.15]I'm happy to hear you say that, Chris.
[132:33.72]When we first met, I was so nervous about first impressions.
[132:40.66]I even hid my face so you wouldn't see.
[132:44.90]How do I even be a friend?
[132:47.02]All I have to do is be nice, is what I thought.
[132:49.18]But I'm starting to realize being friends is more than that, isn't it?
[132:54.77]Susie, sometimes she isn't nice at all.
[132:57.73]She's selfish.
[132:58.33]She's rude.
[132:58.89]She's sarcastic.
[133:01.03]But... Isn't it wonderful that she's her?
[133:03.89]Is what I started thinking today.
[133:06.79]And of course, Chris, it's nice that you're you.
[133:15.25]Just so I could... Dot, dot, dot.
[133:23.75]That's rude.
[133:25.39]It's nice that you're...
[133:28.14]Yeah.
[133:29.18]It's nice that Rousey is Rousey.
[133:36.29]But I'm really trying to pay attention to the dark ride we're on.
[133:41.05]I know that Mickey Mouse is going to jump out a few times.
[133:44.47]Can we talk about this after the ride?
[133:46.62]Huh?
[133:47.98]No one's ever said that to me before.
[133:52.72]I mean, everything's a first for me, but
[133:59.23]Hearing it from you, uh, it means a lot.
[134:04.15]I just wonder what being Rousey-like even is.
[134:09.05]Well, that is for you to decide, Rousey.
[134:11.15]It's not for me to decide, it's for you to decide.
[134:15.25]Sorry, I got off track.
[134:16.05]And I just, I missed it.
[134:17.71]I missed it.
[134:19.23]We turned the corner and fucking Ursula showed up and I wanted to see Ursula.
[134:22.74]Okay.
[134:23.84]I missed it.

[134:26.30]Yeah, okay.
[134:38.81]Wow, Chris, look at all those houses.

[135:17.32]I just remembered Lancer, he's not well.
[135:21.22]Oh dear, didst thou learn try of burping him?

[135:40.19]It's Captain Crunch.
[135:41.35]Then giftingeth her a succulent island present.

[136:04.11]This again.
[136:04.61]Haha, squirming jealousy at my battle caravan.
[136:08.03]It is an effigy of an ancient god of combating.
[136:13.93]I rescued it from the king's trap and fixed it up in this world of scrap-thop.
[136:22.28]It's actually a rejected design we made.
[136:27.44]Oh, this is your creation normally, right.
[136:29.10]Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[136:30.84]Uh-huh, and soon, Valsaltasis rejects the first in the form of various bullets.
[136:39.29]Trash machine reluctantly fights you.
[136:40.69]Oh, hold on a second, Goku.
[136:43.27]Let me go ahead and tell you how to play.
[136:45.09]I know, I know, I'm supposed to have- I'm just doing like the end of the episode thing.
[136:49.88]Wow, I wonder what's going to happen next time.
[136:52.44]They're always, like, eating food, right?
[136:55.02]They're always, like, talking to somebody offscreen.
[136:57.27]Right?
[136:57.71]Why?
[136:57.83]Okay.
[136:57.97]Take house two.
[137:27.28]Uh, take house?
[137:29.08]Take house three.
[137:32.14]Oh man, what am I doing?
[137:33.82]We're claiming tile.
[137:35.36]Claim, you can take this tile.
[137:36.89]Oh fuck, I don't know what I'm doing.
[137:38.19]Claim this house.
[137:43.99]And this one.
[137:45.67]Oh shit, it's one of those things!
[137:46.89]Oops.
[137:49.23]The rules, pronounced rules, are simple.
[137:51.72]Conquer houses, whoever has the most wins.
[137:57.42]I wasn't ready for a... Apple?
[138:05.00]Take house four.
[138:07.56]Take house two.
[138:11.25]You, distract.
[138:20.63]I'm very confused.
[138:22.23]What if I get a...
[138:25.36]House distracted.
[138:26.56]Roles will place one less house next turn.
[138:32.22]I have to go down.
[138:33.24]How's it going?
[138:34.02]Yeah, I'm going down.
[138:34.71]Alright.
[138:36.31]We're going to take two houses.
[138:45.59]We need TP?
[138:47.65]Oh!
[138:54.77]What happens if we win?
[139:00.42]Uh-oh.
[139:06.92]Shit.
[139:07.40]Alright, we're gonna take four houses.
[139:14.65]Sorry.
[139:16.07]Blocked ya!
[139:23.34]Stop, stop, stop building houses!
[139:24.52]I have to win!
[139:28.70]Oh.
[139:29.54]Wait, is that like Connect 4?
[139:33.93]What do I have?
[140:00.20]This dude's a moron.
[140:04.33]I mean, I'm winning.
[140:05.53]What are you talking about?
[140:10.27]You're a dumbass.
[140:11.17]Look, I'm supposed to claim.
[140:11.98]I don't know what you're talking about.
[140:14.94]Kiwi Herman scream.
[140:18.78]I tried.
[140:19.70]I only had a half a second to do that.
[140:21.90]I only had a half a second to get that out.
[140:24.56]I didn't get like 10 minutes in a booth getting prepared, okay?
[140:29.99]Um... I'm winning.
[140:43.36]I'm winning, I think.
[141:00.80]I win.
[141:04.26]I win.
[141:05.26]What did you say, Ab?
[141:08.29]One, two.
[141:09.49]Did I win?
[141:29.13]I won.
[141:30.27]Seems the game has been overed.
[141:31.89]I win.
[141:34.29]What?
[141:34.65]How's doth have more howtheth?
[141:37.48]Cut the battle.
[141:39.24]You won.
[141:40.44]Yet.
[141:41.72]I won.
[141:42.06]Yeah, you guys are freaking out for no reason.
[141:47.20]You guys are freaking out for no reason.
[141:53.01]Ah, ah, ah.
[141:54.35]So thou hast triumphed.
[141:56.55]Not, you have only seen but one percentile of my weapon's abilities.
[142:02.16]Behold, Worm, the real power of Rulfcard.
[142:08.00]God.
[142:12.93]You won by one.
[142:16.69]I still won.
[142:24.36]Look, if I'm in first place, say we're like running a marathon, I'm in first place, you're in second place, and I'm way ahead of you, I'm like 200, let's say I'm 100 fucking yards ahead of you, and I fall down.
[142:40.82]I trip, I fall, I scrape my knee, I roll three times, I get up, a bird flies in my face, hits me in the head.
[142:48.27]Like, a bird shits on me.
[142:49.35]I stop for a minute.
[142:51.30]As long as I cross the finish line before you do, I won the game.
[142:55.32]I won.
[142:56.53]So what do you care?
[143:00.44]I could literally sit down and watch you running towards me.
[143:03.64]Just sit down with my legs kind of just crossed, sitting there waiting for you for a hundred more yards.
[143:08.67]Get up and cross the finish line.
[143:10.23]I will still win the race.
[143:11.71]It doesn't matter how I did it, I came in first.
[143:23.04]Is it a bad analogy?
[143:23.90]How?
[143:24.80]It's just, if you cross the finish line before somebody else, you won.
[143:27.72]It doesn't matter how you got there.
[143:34.94]That's right.
[143:35.62]Rules isn't compatible with this world either.
[143:44.35]Well, let's go, Chris.
[143:45.81]You cheated.
[143:48.56]Oh, I cheated?
[143:50.74]Yeah, fine.
[143:51.14]Let's both do a blood test.
[143:53.50]Okay, fine.
[143:54.06]Let's both do a blood test and see what's going on.
[144:03.06]Looks like the ride's- Oh, it's taking a picture.
[144:04.82]There's a camera- It's gonna take a picture.
[144:11.10]Should we pose?
[144:13.29]Peace sign.
[144:15.93]Rude gesture.
[144:17.69]No, the play- You guys, the play with these things is you- I try to do this every time.
[144:22.91]So, you try to figure out where it is.
[144:26.57]And then, I don't know, I sometimes do that.
[144:28.15]I try to pretend to be asleep.
[144:31.19]Or pretend to be crying.
[144:33.58]Like with a horrible like fucking bawling or just like I'm passed out like my head over.
[144:43.34]Rude gesture.
[144:44.94]I'm going to give it like the finger.
[144:46.64]Hug.
[144:53.31]I don't I don't know if I would do that.
[144:58.91]I honestly if I would probably I would probably pretend to be asleep.
[145:03.60]Or I, I, that, uh, I wouldn't like, I wouldn't grab the person next to me and hug them.
[145:11.67]I would give like the peace sign.
[145:18.42]Or I would give a rude, all right, let's do rude gesture.
[145:23.50]What am I doing?
[145:24.72]What is he doing?
[145:27.39]Wait, what?
[145:30.54]What the hell was that?
[145:32.24]What the hell just happened?
[145:33.74]What has happened?
[145:38.26]You know what's kind of funny?
[145:39.76]There are some people that if a camera... They go into like a weird trance.
[145:45.23]If a camera exists, they'll just give it the finger.
[145:49.53]Do you guys know anybody like that in your life?
[145:51.67]Where it just takes them over?
[145:55.04]It's just like, oh, yeah, here comes a picture.
[145:57.00]Yeah, finger.
[145:58.03]It's like, why do you have to do that?
[145:59.79]It takes over their brain.
[146:04.19]It's almost like the person doesn't really know what to do with their body or with their arms or hands.
[146:09.09]So, like, raising up a middle finger is enough of a, like, hey, look, emotional, emotional.
[146:15.48]Like, look at what I'm doing.
[146:16.40]I don't know.
[146:16.76]It's like there's some people that just snap when a camera turns on.
[146:22.49]And if you go to like, if you go to like their, like let's say you check out like, oh, what do they have on Instagram?
[146:27.79]Oh, what's their Instagram look like?
[146:29.01]It's just like all pictures of them giving the finger.
[146:33.44]Like, okay, do you have any, have any others?
[146:35.80]It's like, oh yeah, like finger, finger, finger, like giving the finger.
[146:41.71]Guys on Tinder.
[146:42.81]Yeah, just like, oh yeah, finger.
[146:47.37]That's king shit.
[146:53.58]But the thing is, I kind of have one of those too.
[146:55.70]I usually, I'll do thumbs up.
[146:58.68]I'll put thumbs up.
[147:00.60]Or, like, peace.
[147:02.72]I'll do, like, thumbs up.
[147:04.18]Or, like, fist.
[147:04.88]I put my fist out.
[147:05.80]I don't know why.
[147:07.28]It's like, okay, I do the thing that if you were to take a picture with a UFC fighter, like, oh, hey, hey, um, I don't know any UFC fighters.
[147:17.68]I can't come up with one.
[147:18.32]I'm going to make one up.
[147:19.64]Hey, uh... Fighter!
[147:22.42]Can I get a picture?
[147:23.30]And they do that thing with their hands where they put their, like, fist up.
[147:25.76]Like, yeah, I'm gonna knock somebody out!
[147:27.95]I do that.
[147:32.53]I don't know why.
[147:33.39]I put, like, fist up.
[147:34.99]Two fists.
[147:36.19]Thumbs up.
[147:36.79]Fist.
[147:39.25]I have no idea why I do that.
[147:44.45]Let's keep going.
[147:46.99]Yo, I'm a big fan of Fighter.
[147:49.49]Aren't they just going to leave with me here?
[147:50.95]Aren't they even going to throw with me the picture?
[148:01.65]Why would you want to take a picture with you?
[148:02.97]I don't know.
[148:06.34]I'm not looking for that.
[148:08.80]If you want one, I'll do it.
[148:26.91]Chris, are you wondering how Susie is doing right now?
[148:29.91]I'll be honest, I actually forgot the person was in the game.
[148:34.20]It's been like a while.
[148:37.96]I don't, I don't, I don't, it's not that I don't care.
[148:39.90]Yeah, I've been wondering.
[148:43.86]Well, then why don't we close our eyes and think about what she's doing now?
[148:47.62]I don't want, I don't really want to do that.
[148:52.65]What a strange moon.
[148:57.97]Like nothing I've ever seen before.
[149:04.00]This world.
[149:05.98]I wish Des could see it.
[149:09.66]That was bad acting.
[149:10.52]I'm sorry.
[149:10.90]I'll be better.
[149:11.48]Is somebody there?
[149:14.33]Wait, what are you... Hey!
[149:18.77]You can't capture someone who's already captured!
[149:27.24]Susie?
[149:28.88]You saved me.
[149:33.98]Don't get used to it.
[149:35.82]Um, okay, I... I won't.
[149:37.38]Cool moon.
[149:47.19]Yeah.
[149:48.79]It's weird, isn't it?
[149:51.05]How did we get here?
[149:53.17]What even is this place?
[149:56.62]You see, a million years ago, a bomb exploded in the atmosphere.
[150:00.78]And you know what?
[150:02.43]It's too much for right now.
[150:05.35]Uh, it's, um... Evil Queen's Castle or the Dark World?
[150:14.84]I mean, aren't both of these things true?
[150:24.69]Uh, you're, um, just having a dream.
[150:26.59]Huh?
[150:31.99]Oh, oh, that's right.
[150:33.81]Right.
[150:34.27]If you're here, it must be a dream.
[150:39.57]I mean, the real Susie probably wouldn't save me, would she?
[150:42.01]She probably doesn't care about me at all.
[150:47.79]Huh?
[150:50.87]Why would you think that?
[150:56.10]Um, she doesn't care about anybody.
[151:00.32]Well, fair, but... Did you ever wonder why Susie never picked on you?
[151:08.23]All the time.
[151:08.81]This is kind of an inaccurate, um, if you're lucid.
[151:13.63]If I'm lucid, it's only happened a few times.
[151:16.57]But I just started, I'm lucid, I'm grabbing, like, the fucking bureau and I'm throwing it out the window.
[151:20.13]I'm throwing it out the window as hard as I can.
[151:22.53]Like, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna start smashing the window.
[151:25.71]Right?
[151:27.72]This is my one opportunity to, like, throw a beer out of the window.
[151:29.92]I'm gonna do it.
[151:32.90]The second that I feel lucid, it's just like, oh my fucking god, I'm in a dream.
[151:36.27]Okay.
[151:37.53]Okay, I see a stick over there.
[151:38.51]I'm gonna javelin the stick out the window.
[151:40.35]Because, like, I'm gonna do that.
[151:41.77]I'm doing my lucid dream.
[151:42.93]I'm awake.
[151:43.27]Fuck.
[151:46.77]You're ruining the moment.
[151:47.53]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[151:54.23]Maybe it's because when she first came to class, you lent her one of your pencils.
[151:58.89]Somebody call the caveman.
[152:05.12]Okay, we're actually ruining this.
[152:08.46]Stick!
[152:09.36]I see stick!
[152:10.40]Break something!
[152:11.98]Smash!
[152:15.44]All right, I'm not, I'm gonna actually, I'm gonna actually pay attention.
[152:18.46]Enough.
[152:20.84]You lent her one of your pencils.
[152:23.50]Like a dumb candy cane looking one or something.
[152:28.82]And even though it didn't actually taste like candy, she remembered your smile and, uh, decided to spare you, you know?
[152:39.35]That's, um, really specific.
[152:43.25]Yeah, well, uh, wait, did you say you ate the pencil?
[152:47.23]I mean, uh, look.
[152:51.11]Uh, hey, so do you dream about me a lot?
[152:56.00]Well, time for me to get back to my, uh, project.
[152:59.00]Haha.
[153:00.06]Okay, Susie, hit me with your axe and wake me up.
[153:04.86]Uh, no, I can't do that.
[153:06.72]Why not?
[153:07.06]It's just a dream.
[153:07.74]Uh, I mean, didn't you want to, uh, hang out some more?
[153:17.95]Stop voice acting?
[153:20.62]You want us to hit A and we'll just read it silently together?
[153:23.78]I'm reading it!
[153:24.34]Time that guy out for four years.
[153:27.62]I guess Birdly can wait a little longer.
[153:36.85]Alright, let's get out of here then.
[153:43.23]Time that person out four years in Goldfish years.
[153:45.10]Should be like, I don't know, probably like a few hours.
[153:48.99]All we gotta do is head to the right over this.
[153:50.63]Uh, over here.
[153:57.28]And this, uh... What the hell is going on?
[154:02.88]Wait, this is a dream.
[154:04.36]Heart-covered Ferris wheel.
[154:11.21]Uh... What's the goddamn holdup?
[154:13.03]Get on already!
[154:15.17]Sorry.
[154:20.76]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[154:23.36]Uh, here.
[154:23.82]Man, Chris would know what to do.
[154:28.40]Eat moss.
[154:32.08]Me, caveman!
[154:33.50]Caveman and lucid dream!
[154:34.76]Eat moss!
[154:35.38]Break things!
[154:35.94]Smash!
[154:38.65]Point and hearts come out.
[154:45.39]Did I eat the moss?
[154:46.39]I feel like that's weird.
[154:47.39]Why would somebody do that?
[154:52.02]I'm gonna eat moss.
[154:54.82]Actually, maybe Chris wouldn't know what to do.
[154:59.22]So, uh, Ferris wheels, huh?
[155:02.06]Kind of makes you wonder what car they were built for.
[155:06.46]It's different than riding one with Chris.
[155:08.72]What the hell's wrong?
[155:10.22]You scared of heights?
[155:12.34]No, no, I love heights, haha.
[155:17.28]You're shaking.
[155:19.69]Comforted?
[155:20.27]I guess I do like slime and blood.
[155:46.07]It's scary, but I can just turn it off, right?
[155:48.71]Now it's mostly people that are scary.
[155:50.59]Haha.
[155:56.87]Just say you mean... You can just say you mean me.
[156:01.99]Well, I guess you too, but... That's what's nice about you, you know.
[156:08.51]Nice?
[156:08.85]The hell does that mean?
[156:11.02]You're the good kind of scary.
[156:13.24]You aren't afraid to break the rules, you know?
[156:15.14]I wish I could do crazy stuff like you.
[156:18.07]Okay.
[156:26.19]What's the difference here?
[156:33.74]Nuts would be like... Nuts would be like I get up and just start like flossing.
[156:40.16]Right?
[156:43.00]Like, that's not.
[156:44.84]Crazy would be, uh, I see how long I can, like, hold my breath for.
[156:49.02]Which one?
[156:54.69]Or, like, I see if I can, like, hang outside the Ferris wheel with my hands for, like, a photo.
[157:00.41]Like, take a picture of me hanging outside the Ferris wheel with my hands.
[157:09.40]Uh... Craziest smash window.
[157:12.20]Alright, let's do nuts.
[157:14.10]So, um... If you could do something crazy right now, what would you do?
[157:19.15]Um, well, I... I jump out the window.
[157:25.60]See?
[157:25.92]See?
[157:28.14]She gets it.
[157:28.54]Huh?
[157:31.60]It's a dream, right?
[157:33.08]And I'm the fucking weirdo.
[157:34.54]All you guys' favorite character just said the same goddamn thing that I did.
[157:39.10]I'd grow big angel wings and fly as far as I can, gazing back at it all.
[157:46.30]Skyline shining like holiday lights.
[157:50.30]Window.
[157:51.66]That's kind of beautiful.
[157:52.72]Wait, you wouldn't seriously jump out, would you?
[157:57.61]No promises!
[158:00.37]Susie?
[158:01.85]What do you think, looking out there?
[158:03.33]Me, uh... I mean, do we say something romantic here?
[158:14.34]Something cool?
[158:16.71]I think we've already done the cool bit, right?
[158:20.23]We already are cool.
[158:29.16]Stay cool?
[158:29.82]No, I feel like we've already been cool.
[158:31.26]I feel like we stayed cool for the first, like, half of this Ferris Wheel ride.
[158:34.82]I think it's time to do something romantic.
[158:41.02]Let's go for it.
[158:43.44]Uh, seeing everything small makes me feel like, um... If I was Susie Zilla or something, I could wreck the whole city.
[158:51.76]Ha ha ha, Susie!
[158:54.13]Eh, well, that's romantic.
[158:56.49]Is being Susie Zilla something you think about a lot?
[159:00.30]Uh, like... No, I just made it up.
[159:04.56]No.
[159:06.24]Does your tail always do that when you lie?
[159:08.12]Hey, don't look at that!
[159:10.32]I don't have a tail.
[159:11.88]It's part of your dream.
[159:15.80]Oh, right.
[159:16.36]Sorry.
[159:20.58]Guess I'll just have to check in real life, too.
[159:24.40]Hey, don't.
[159:27.99]Susie, is everything okay?
[159:30.32]Look, I just... I just don't like people knowing about it.
[159:33.48]Uh, well, I think it's a nice tail.
[159:39.31]Whatever.
[159:39.65]It's wagging.
[159:44.15]Alright, those of you that have dogs, anytime you dog, if your dog's lying down, just kind of hanging out, does your dog do this too?
[159:53.07]Where if you look at your dog, right, like in the eyes, or if you look over at them and they're just kind of relaxing, you'll just...
[160:00.70]You just hear that.
[160:01.28]That's what Otto does.
[160:05.97]You look over.
[160:07.01]You're just sitting there.
[160:07.63]You're playing a game.
[160:08.37]You're watching TV.
[160:09.85]Dog is on your right.
[160:10.99]They're not paying attention to you at all.
[160:12.63]They just sense your eyeballs.
[160:14.61]You turn and look.
[160:19.43]It's the cutest thing ever.
[160:22.15]Susie's not a dog.
[160:23.63]I didn't... I didn't say that Susie was a dog.
[160:33.17]You stopped shaking.
[160:34.09]Guess I got comfortable.
[160:40.21]Me too.
[160:43.90]Well, that wasn't too bad.
[160:46.28]Yeah.
[160:51.50]If only I could dream like this every day.
[160:53.24]Alright, at what point do I just go, alright, hey, this is not a dream.
[160:56.69]This is real.
[160:57.91]Uh, this is a real thing.
[160:58.85]I just was messing with you.
[161:00.85]Maybe it doesn't have to be a dream, you know?
[161:04.91]Susie.
[161:06.41]Maybe, maybe someday we could... Noelle, my lady, the cavalry has arrived to rescue you.
[161:21.54]Oh, the good part of the dream is over.
[161:22.94]It's fine, Birdly's going to help.
[161:26.06]We're allies.
[161:27.78]Yes, don't worry, Noelle.
[161:29.26]I'm stupid now.
[161:33.28]He's good.
[161:36.58]Look, I gotta go save the day now, all right?
[161:38.15]Uh-huh.
[161:39.75]Um, good luck, Suzy.
[161:41.91]All right, Nugget Boy.
[161:43.13]It's up to you now.
[161:45.97]Leave everything to me, my dear Susan.
[161:52.47]Yeah, whatever.
[161:53.00]May the smarts be with you.
[161:58.32]Ah, she left before I could... Well, it's hard to say this.
[162:04.64]You've done so much for me, and I... Well, I'm sorry.
[162:08.50]Apparently you're actually apologizing?
[162:13.10]Thank you.
[162:13.52]I understand, you know.
[162:15.44]You've always been nice to me when it's just the two of us.
[162:19.18]You just wanted to make a happy world for me.
[162:22.05]I'm glad you realized, um, it sucked.
[162:26.31]Oh.
[162:26.43]Huh?
[162:28.99]I mean, yes, I was, in a way, apologizing for that.
[162:33.25]But...
[162:34.43]I also wanted to apologize for leading you on.
[162:37.30]I know you only always help me out because, well... You had a crush on me, so... What?
[162:50.43]Oh, sorry.
[162:51.03]Please don't be embarrassed.
[162:53.15]It's understandable.
[162:54.49]But I have to tell you, I... I really value your friendship, okay?
[162:59.05]So...
[163:00.74]I felt I had to pretend to reciprocate those feelings.
[163:04.94]What?
[163:05.28]But I don't... I never... Furthermore, I think that I may have... Discovered someone else for me.
[163:14.66]Huh?
[163:16.00]Please don't be jealous.
[163:19.10]Of... Susie.
[163:22.31]What?
[163:23.07]What?
[163:23.49]What?
[163:23.95]What?
[163:24.35]Bart!
[163:26.17]What are you doing, Bart?
[163:32.54]That was a bad homer, but I only had a second.
[163:36.89]So that's why.
[163:40.11]Geronimo!
[163:45.07]Hey, miss me?
[163:46.75]Of course not!
[163:48.28]Just kidding.
[163:48.80]That was sarcasm.
[163:49.78]I miss you.
[163:50.26]Hey, we gotta work on your delivery.
[163:56.42]Anyway, let's go.
[164:00.58]Everyone's together, but the wind blows coldly.
[164:02.58]You are filled with a certain power.
[164:15.81]Why you little... Where wire strongly blocks the way.
[164:28.86]Be tough, let's be sweet.
[164:32.40]And let's do that.
[164:33.14]That was like a lightning strike.
[164:35.14]Okay, now let's be tough.
[164:57.30]You and Susie told where-where-where you'd beat them up.
[164:59.76]The air crackles with a fighting spirit.
[165:02.24]Rousey winks demurely.
[165:06.62]How you doing?
[165:13.31]You good?
[165:14.27]No, not yet.
[165:14.65]Let's be cold.
[165:20.71]Let's, uh, stand it.
[165:24.00]Let's spam it.
[165:31.06]Alright, that's to the third floor.
[165:33.80]Let's check here.
[165:38.92]Whoa, this statue rocks.
[165:40.92]Hey, Rousey.
[165:42.54]Can we take this from my room?
[165:44.90]Huh?
[165:45.26]Um, that would be stealing.
[165:47.90]You stole the Susie-like statue.
[165:51.62]There are all sorts of clothes inside.
[165:52.90]Oh, I've never seen Noelle wear anything like this.
[165:57.93]The search is isoreal cryptid.
[166:03.25]It's a cross between Icy and something else.
[166:06.24]Hey, Chris, take this for your room.
[166:09.14]That would be stealing.
[166:10.32]You stole the Icy statue.
[166:11.74]Catalogs of search results.
[166:15.52]Seems like most things couldn't be made into objects.
[166:21.48]It's a bed.
[166:22.00]Go to sleep?
[166:24.00]Yes.
[166:25.34]Chris, what if Noelle came in here?
[166:26.58]Yeah, what if she has tics?
[166:29.08]Get out of there.
[166:33.14]Wardrobe.
[166:41.11]It's a calendar.
[166:42.49]Every page is the last month.
[166:43.89]Every day is the 25th.
[166:44.71]What's this?
[167:06.63]I'm gonna go up top.
[167:26.62]Go to the trash zone.
[167:27.56]Trash zone.
[167:28.16]Trash.
[167:28.50]Trash.
[167:28.80]Trash.
[167:29.08]Trash.
[167:29.40]Trash.
[167:29.72]Trash.
[167:30.04]Trash.
[167:30.24]Am I at the end of the game?
[167:30.84]This is it?
[167:33.48]I'm not gonna have an opportunity to go to the trash zone?
[167:37.29]Is it?
[167:39.15]You're at the end.
[167:39.77]Alright, so go to the trash zone.
[167:42.59]You're literally one step away from the end.
[167:47.93]I already did the spamton thing.
[167:49.65]Is there something else there?
[167:50.47]Did I already do that?
[167:54.37]You don't have to?
[167:55.49]You got a few hours left.
[167:57.25]No, I don't think that's correct.
[168:01.18]No, it's... Can I do it afterwards?
[168:04.32]There's something there.
[168:07.07]Lore, lore.
[168:08.47]I'll go after her.
[168:14.66]There she is.
[168:23.18]Queen, stop right there!
[168:24.18]Ah, my sweet idiot children!
[168:28.54]You are just in time to witness my world domination!
[168:31.93]With Noelle in my possession, it is only a matter of time before her will turns and she unleashes her power, blacketing the world in... Too late, dumbass.
[168:42.78]Noelle's with Birdly.
[168:45.18]Oh.
[168:46.44]Then who is... this?
[168:48.38]B-b-b-birdly!
[168:52.58]He's been intercepted.
[168:53.70]My control plugs are now suitable for teenagers.
[168:57.74]Now the whole family can enjoy eternal servitude.
[169:01.95]Sort of regal, mostly cruel laughter!
[169:05.25]Hee hee hee hee!
[169:07.37]Wait then, where's the elk?
[169:10.21]Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
[169:13.63]I wonder... I actually know the answer.
[169:16.41]Enough already!
[169:19.27]Oh dear, I do sincerely quite like you two.
[169:22.65]It would be a shame for me to force you to serve me.
[169:26.24]An enjoyable shame.
[169:32.03]This is the end!
[169:33.57]The queen blocks the way.
[169:36.01]Queen defenseless.
[169:38.73]Throw.
[169:39.19]Group loosen.
[169:40.07]Alright, we're gonna group loosen on Birdly.
[169:44.06]Birdly's gonna get sentient again.
[169:46.72]Join the party.
[169:48.60]This is a good song.
[169:51.98]Everyone loosens Birdly.
[169:52.94]I mean, think of the Lightners.
[169:55.67]Aren't we supposed to make them happy?
[169:58.07]Not what I'm doing?
[170:01.92]Ooh, I didn't know they were going to move like that.
[170:08.88]Shit.
[170:09.62]Fountain flows ominously.
[170:13.01]Oh, shit.
[170:13.25]I thought that was... I thought that was her mouth.
[170:15.05]I thought that was the big statue, and it actually was her, and that was her mouth opening and closing.
[170:20.85]I thought she was like the biggest Stay Puft Marshmallow man.
[170:28.06]Alright, um...
[170:33.19]No, I'm gonna throw.
[170:35.39]Because I need to heal.
[170:39.26]Oh, fuck.
[170:40.60]We'll do it next time.
[170:48.44]Bingo!
[170:49.88]I can't... My voice is fucked forever.
[170:51.96]I got too old.
[170:52.73]I can't do it anymore.
[170:53.51]If I talk loudly... If I yell loudly without screaming, that happens.
[171:01.81]I'm too old.
[171:11.22]Queen's acid shield is formed.
[171:14.00]Interesting.
[171:14.33]Alright, we're gonna do group toast.
[171:21.27]Alright, group toast.
[171:22.91]That glass of acid is generating her shield.
[171:26.03]Are you gonna drink all that?
[171:29.67]No, this is all mine!
[171:30.55]You can't have it!
[171:31.13]Queen sips from her acid.
[171:35.70]Each day they spend hours worshiping and glowing rapture.
[171:38.56]Our screens are funny animals and candied games.
[171:48.71]Fucking ten years of Binding of Isaac prepared me for that one.
[171:54.25]Group toast.
[171:55.83]Toast to the queen.
[171:56.45]The queen sips from her acid.
[172:01.40]Staring, tapping to receive joy.
[172:04.64]Staring, tapping to avoid pain!
[172:06.28]Easy.
[172:17.25]Alright, Ashen Shield is down.
[172:19.59]We're going to do... Loosen again.
[172:22.33]Where's he at?
[172:22.75]Until recently when the town's internet disappeared.
[172:27.05]Now the refuge they take in the screens will slowly fade.
[172:30.41]A little drink.
[172:40.57]Acid Shield is there again.
[172:41.47]Alright, let's spare.
[172:43.09]He's almost halfway.
[172:46.08]I am going to... Dual Heal.
[172:50.34]Yeah, let's do Dual Heal.
[172:52.94]And then we're just gonna... Toast to the Queen.
[172:58.34]The soul shined its power on Rousey.
[173:01.15]Susie made a toast to the Queen.
[173:03.23]Pretty cool how we're gonna kick your ass.
[173:06.69]Good thing I have no standards for this.
[173:09.13]Clean sips from her acid.
[173:13.56]Rousey casts dual heal.
[173:14.58]There we go.
[173:17.36]Well, then who will help her?
[173:18.72]Her strange and sad searches.
[173:21.40]Who will answer them?
[173:26.60]Ooh, that's a weird one.
[173:31.18]That's an interesting one.
[173:36.04]Toast.
[173:39.70]It's what I wondered until the night appeared and created this wonderful world of darkness.
[173:44.20]Smells like overclocked high heels.
[173:56.95]What?
[174:02.53]Toast.
[174:02.89]Come on.
[174:09.62]Expand the dark world.
[174:24.16]One more toast.
[174:28.00]There it goes, alright.
[174:30.72]End the world covered in darkness.
[174:32.68]No one will have to suffer anymore.
[174:43.55]Alright, let's go for it.
[174:46.13]Group loosen again.
[174:47.95]He's close.
[174:50.01]Everyone can live in my perfect mansion.
[174:52.51]Everyday blissfully worshipping me like we both deserve.
[175:00.00]Drama.
[175:00.28]Alright, let's do- what is that?
[175:08.60]Birdly is almost there.
[175:15.26]Red Buster.
[175:18.19]No.
[175:18.39]Throw.
[175:20.67]Yeah, then we can do a blue kill.
[175:23.89]No, heal Kris.
[175:27.51]Fuck.
[175:37.16]Stop resisting and welcome the new age of darkness.
[175:54.06]Red Buster.
[175:56.36]Is this going to hurt?
[176:00.99]I'm not going to hurt her.
[176:02.21]Let's try it.
[176:03.27]Let's see what happens.
[176:10.53]Rousey made a toast to the queen.
[176:12.47]Toast to you, making me wear a butler outfit.
[176:15.72]Bro, that's weird, but okay.
[176:16.94]Alright, Red Buster.
[176:21.06]Alright, that took a lot down here.
[176:26.44]did I say I would do that?
[176:36.49]Oh, that's a weird pattern.
[176:37.87]Okay.
[176:39.25]Um, we're gonna go with... I'm going to... I need to do a group heal.
[176:48.38]I need the TP.
[176:48.84]Which is it?
[176:58.56]Do I not have it?
[176:59.08]Heal player?
[176:59.56]Do I not have a group heal?
[177:01.94]Fuck.
[177:02.30]Oh, wait a minute.
[177:09.74]Shit.
[177:10.08]No, I don't have any more.
[177:11.96]Revives team.
[177:20.19]Oh, shit.
[177:20.83]I need 50 TP.
[177:21.79]Damn it.
[177:22.27]Alright, we're going to defend.
[177:25.47]Alright, here's the play.
[177:30.60]No, what am I doing?
[177:31.54]Oops.
[177:32.42]Okay.
[177:33.14]No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[177:34.16]I didn't want to spend all that.
[177:39.64]Let's don't get hit, bro.
[177:41.24]Let's don't get hit, bro!
[177:54.54]All right, now we're going to get the bird.
[177:55.72]Let's go.
[177:57.62]Enough, you foolish children.
[177:58.96]You may have survived my attacks regular, but I've been secretly, been secretly, been downloading my ultimate move the whole time.
[178:04.66]I'll perish in the bosom of my hellish reign.
[178:19.43]Oh, that was close.
[178:21.47]All right, let's get them.
[178:27.44]This should be enough, right?
[178:28.64]Group loosen!
[178:30.78]Go!
[178:31.08]So that final move was supposed to be cooler, but the internet is down!
[178:36.06]Uh-oh.
[178:46.16]Sounds like overclocked high heels.
[178:47.20]Alright, we need, uh... What do I have?
[178:51.84]Revive dust?
[178:54.60]Revives team.
[178:55.96]Oh, shit.
[179:02.52]Will this work?
[179:04.98]Can I revive him by healing?
[179:11.70]What is he at right now?
[179:12.96]Alright, he's like there.
[179:28.56]Okay, early wire is loose.
[179:31.32]What juice?
[179:31.80]I think we got it.
[179:36.42]Not bad, you foolish children.
[179:40.87]Hmm?
[179:44.91]What are you doing?
[179:45.49]Why isn't my control wire working?
[179:47.79]Thanks to my comrades' kindness, their mercy.
[179:52.37]Now, it's time for me to take my freedom.
[179:57.23]Queen, you may have mastered the number three, but can you stand up against four of us?
[180:05.52]Running simulation for the number four?
[180:07.12]Hmm.
[180:09.60]You are definitely going to kick my ass.
[180:12.59]Unless... Oh no, what that?
[180:15.53]Wait.
[180:20.87]One nanosecond.
[180:22.03]You cowardette.
[180:24.00]You...
[180:29.16]Glass.
[180:30.68]Birdly?
[180:33.10]Ah, just now was nothing more than simple bravado.
[180:36.20]Truth is, that wire already absorbed all my succulent energy juices.
[180:44.55]Birdly, hey.
[180:45.29]Birdly, are you okay?
[180:47.35]Everything getting dark.
[180:50.89]Only a kiss from a beautiful gamer girl can save me now.
[180:59.09]Erdely.
[181:02.99]What?
[181:04.37]Like, you're losing consciousness and stuff, but could you speak up?
[181:10.35]Sorry, suddenly I'm feeling a bit better.
[181:15.01]That's a relief.
[181:19.31]Well, gotta hurry and save Noelle, so later.
[181:23.98]Ah, dear Susan.
[181:25.52]So enigmatic in her ways.
[181:28.74]But I can read her heart, Chris.
[181:30.69]Like a health meter.
[181:32.07]And it's beeping for love.
[181:34.95]Ha!
[181:35.73]Well enough tales, Chris.
[181:37.11]Good luck.
[181:38.51]May the smarts not be with you.
[181:41.29]Ding!
[181:42.64]Ding!
[181:45.52]Okay.
[181:49.84]Chris, your deep concern for me is dexterous.
[181:54.69]Stay sanguine, my fellow bluebird.
[181:58.79]I'll find some way to help you out.
[182:09.16]If you're going to the trash zone, this is the point of no return.
[182:18.27]If I go right one screen, you're saying?
[182:23.00]Should I go all the way back left or do I have like a shortcut here?
[182:29.06]Fuck the lore.
[182:31.22]Don't.
[182:32.32]Trash zone is just don't go.
[182:33.92]Don't.
[182:34.20]Who cares?
[182:34.60]It's not important.
[182:37.82]Okay.
[182:42.60]Oh, whatever.
[182:55.23]The night, the roaring night, the day it deigned to create this world, reaching its long hand to the sky.
[183:08.51]It coursed its will into its blade, and made, thrusting the fountain from the earth.
[183:18.66]Unfortunately, the world they created is trapped within the confines of the library.
[183:24.97]If only we had a way to make more darkness.
[183:29.94]We might be able to cover the whole world.
[183:36.94]That is when I realized.
[183:38.16]This power, this power of the will.
[183:42.40]This power of determination.
[183:43.82]Is this not something that all Lightners possess?
[183:50.42]If one was simply determined enough.
[183:54.12]Would not anyone make a dark fountain?
[183:58.41]So then, if the night has taken its leave, then I will simply make a new one.
[184:05.09]Farewell, honey, darling, sweetie gravy.
[184:13.11]How do you find the giant hand?
[184:16.32]Great.
[184:16.92]And how do you feel about world domination?
[184:20.22]Ew!
[184:20.78]Ooh, ouchie, mama!
[184:26.49]Susie, you came to save me.
[184:29.17]Somehow, I knew you would.
[184:31.75]Uh, you did?
[184:32.27]I mean, I, um... Wait.
[184:37.76]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[184:39.04]You need to get out of here.
[184:40.04]Hurry!
[184:41.70]Oh?
[184:41.92]She is giant.
[184:48.15]Yeah, I knew it.
[184:51.89]That was the statue I was thinking of, right?
[184:54.57]I thought that portal was the mouth.
[184:56.30]That's the real mouth.
[184:58.12]Queen?
[184:59.48]Seems that you failed to notice the giant freaking robot in the middle of my palace.
[185:06.06]This isn't good.
[185:06.72]She's invincible like this.
[185:09.06]Huh?
[185:10.59]She's been bragging about her final form all day.
[185:15.15]I think growing a few inches is going to help.
[185:19.03]Yes.
[185:22.81]What the fuck?
[185:25.23]Are we cool to take over the world now?
[185:28.43]Susie, let's just give up.
[185:30.73]Hell if we're giving up now.
[185:33.11]Susie, what if you got another form?
[185:36.03]We've got one too.
[185:38.22]Chris, Rousey, come on.
[185:42.30]Oh my god.
[185:43.48]What are you guys doing?
[185:45.40]This is our ultimate.
[185:47.24]Wait a second.
[185:47.90]Now that you mention it.
[185:49.54]Oh no, it appears I am evenly matched.
[185:52.44]I hope you won't mind if I don't hold back.
[185:59.91]We're falling.
[186:00.47]Any bright ideas on how we're going to get out of this?
[186:05.27]Uh, we could try flapping our arms.
[186:06.79]Fear not.
[186:09.02]Your knight in glow in the dark armor is here.
[186:12.75]Early?
[186:15.84]Chris!
[186:16.24]Susie!
[186:16.96]My energy is still too low to help you fight.
[186:20.08]So I found help for you.
[186:21.70]Behold!
[186:22.54]Comrades!
[186:24.78]On your quest against the Queen!
[186:26.54]You've made all sorts of buddies, right?
[186:28.79]Using our junk making skills!
[186:30.91]We modify everyone!
[186:32.55]To work together!
[186:34.31]I shall take credit for this.
[186:37.29]The man of a million voices!
[186:39.01]Five!
[186:40.60]Chris!
[186:40.96]Susie!
[186:41.40]Behold!
[186:43.01]The ultimate group project.
[186:46.09]With a splendid base.
[186:48.97]My strongest JPEGs.
[186:51.05]Oh wait, no.
[186:51.96]My strongest JPEGs.
[186:55.14]Flashing lights.
[186:57.60]Happy bravery.
[187:02.90]My energy.
[187:07.94]Tender loving care.
[187:10.36]Fresh cooking.
[187:12.69]organization and most of all whatever is this thing in oh my goodness what is going on now finally a worthy opponent
[187:41.79]What?
[187:42.55]Oh shit, here we go!
[187:44.13]It's the fighting game!
[187:46.75]Giga Queen blocks the way.
[187:50.33]Alright, Giga Queen.
[187:52.16]Laser mode turbo dodge.
[187:54.32]Self fix.
[187:59.60]Could I attack?
[188:02.93]Or should I build TP and then do the other stuff?
[188:13.79]Time for the words is... The time for words is over.
[188:18.01]Now it's time to fight only.
[188:21.75]Oh fuck, I didn't know we were doing this right now.
[188:26.72]The buttons?
[188:28.72]The buttons!
[188:33.04]The cityscape roars past.
[188:34.88]Alright, Giga Queen.
[188:35.64]Alright, let's go.
[188:40.82]Just kidding, I totally will keep monologuing as I kick at your face!
[188:53.61]Nice.
[188:57.56]The knight is young for fighting.
[188:58.98]Let's help fix.
[189:01.42]What am I doing?
[189:02.74]I think I got plenty of health.
[189:08.36]Time has come for Noelle to realize her own strength, her own will, her own determination.
[189:20.26]Fuckhead!
[189:25.72]Rousey advises you to dodge then counterpunch.
[189:28.00]What do you think I've been doing?
[189:40.32]Focusing into her blade, she will create a Neo Dark Fountain.
[189:44.12]Then another, then another.
[189:56.35]Oh wait, it's 1-1-1-1-1.
[189:59.79]Queen's attacks just got tougher.
[190:06.41]Then when the whole world is covered in darkness, she and everyone can live in bliss, free of fear and suffering.
[190:12.76]Ooh.
[190:19.06]Ooh.
[190:20.16]Okay, I gotta learn the fight.
[190:22.28]Self-fix.
[190:26.97]First Susie, why don't you help me to create the world of your dreams and not of my dreams?
[190:42.74]Trucy!
[190:44.18]Bro, just let me karate chop you and you can have as many skateboards as you want!
[190:55.72]What do I got?
[190:56.84]Um... Laser mode?
[191:01.37]Laser mode.
[191:03.05]A light quick aura fired up.
[191:06.73]Oh, shit.
[191:07.99]And Chris, my dearest Trucy, you can have as many...
[191:11.62]Hey, I don't remember what you liked!
[191:12.61]Ah!
[191:17.67]Haste 3 incoming.
[191:23.55]Oh, it hurt!
[191:24.35]Gotta heal.
[191:33.06]Sorry.
[191:33.70]Round 3.
[191:34.08]The attacks are extreme now.
[191:35.98]Alright, I need 30% TP.
[191:37.07]Get it right here.
[191:42.59]Hey, was there a third guy?
[191:46.77]Ah!
[191:51.07]Oh, I go through the legs.
[191:56.66]Shit, I need more turbo dodge?
[191:58.26]No.
[192:02.74]Join me and all of you will become super strong and cool.
[192:05.04]Meanwhile, I don't need to improve because I'm already perfect and can shoot lasers from my fancy glass.
[192:17.60]Shit, let me give me a chance to fucking hit ya!
[192:24.44]I believe I've made my point.
[192:25.46]I'm going to procedurally loop my dialogue now.
[192:42.60]I got
[192:51.16]Whoa, that's a new move.
[192:54.74]Alright, turbo dodge?
[192:55.70]No.
[192:56.44]Again.
[193:11.14]Alright, now it's time to heal again.
[193:12.14]No.
[193:12.40]Yes.
[193:12.80]Heal.
[193:12.94]Heal!
[193:34.14]First Susie, other guy.
[193:35.38]You have truly proven yourself to be worthy of learning.
[193:37.68]You have earned the right to remember what your fighting machine's true purpose is.
[193:40.46]To get your own ass thrashed.
[193:43.26]By me.
[193:44.09]With my final attack.
[193:45.89]Bye.
[193:46.17]Shit.
[193:50.41]What the fuck is an Omega Baseball?
[194:00.42]Did I get it?
[194:10.75]Battle power dropping!
[194:13.15]Overheat activated!
[194:16.47]Listen well!
[194:17.93]You may have defeated me, but I still possess one thing.
[194:22.85]You three will never have... Detachable hands!
[194:29.66]Was I supposed to punch that?
[194:33.84]Did I lose?
[194:43.12]Noelle?
[194:45.98]Darling?
[194:48.50]Honey?
[194:51.19]Sweetie?
[194:54.37]Gravy?
[195:01.99]Pick the pin I gave you and stab the earth, creating our new supreme empire.
[195:12.72]I...
[195:14.50]What's wrong, Noelle?
[195:16.44]I know what would make you happy.
[195:19.02]Or should I, with the last 1% of my battery, push Susie into eight bits?
[195:31.73]Leave?
[195:34.51]Leave Susie alone!
[195:36.07]You think listening to you makes me happy?
[195:38.81]No, I'll never be happy if I'm controlled by you.
[195:41.73]Why can't you understand that?
[195:46.24]That was acting class.
[195:47.54]That was like, okay, if you have a room with like 100 people in an acting workshop.
[195:53.46]That's like, that was like how I did it, you know, in my acting classes.
[195:58.25]Sometimes you just like, you blow out like the first workshop.
[196:03.01]And then like when you get the second assignment, like you go nuts.
[196:05.60]You're a fucking lightning rod.
[196:06.54]You act your ass off in the first like 20 minutes, 30 minutes of the class.
[196:10.08]And you don't want to do anymore and you're kind of just done.
[196:15.56]I'm not going to go like 100 miles per hour again.
[196:17.40]Perhaps my computations were miscalibrated.
[196:25.52]Noelle, disregard me and, with your own power, choose the world that makes you happy.
[196:43.94]Queen?
[196:45.42]Queen?
[196:46.86]Queen, are you okay?
[196:49.52]Seems she ran out of battery power.
[196:52.50]Guess we can seal the fountain now, right?
[196:59.78]Everybody?
[197:04.55]Queen, she said, choose the world that makes you happy.
[197:08.91]I don't want to live in a world ruled by her.
[197:12.05]But if that wasn't the case, I wonder if this world wouldn't be so bad.
[197:19.60]Huh?
[197:21.68]Susie, don't you think so too?
[197:24.53]I, uh... How do you mention it?
[197:27.87]Chris, isn't this world just better?
[197:29.71]You make so many friends here, you know?
[197:34.82]I've never had an adventure like this before.
[197:37.63]Axes and battles and magic.
[197:40.85]Everything can be healed with a little spell.
[197:42.67]And no matter what happens, no one tells us what to do.
[197:48.66]Gosh, yeah.
[197:50.32]So even if things were really scary just now, I mean... So is there any reason not to...
[198:00.51]Not that I can think of.
[198:02.71]Me neither.
[198:03.47]Then, well, let this be my real apology.
[198:12.45]Concentrating my will into this blade, I will make a new fountain and unleash a bright future.
[198:19.40]A future that shines for us.
[198:22.04]A future whose brightness is born from darkness.
[198:26.22]Stop.
[198:29.93]What in the world are you all doing?
[198:36.79]Well, we talked... Stop!
[198:40.23]Stop!
[198:41.31]You realize what will happen if you do that?
[198:42.77]I... will just... You'll bring the roaring!
[198:57.03]When the light is subsumed by shadow, when the fountains fill the sky, all will fall into chaos.
[199:14.51]I can do anything.
[199:16.66]Titans will take form from the fountains and envelop the land in devastation.
[199:32.99]I had an opportunity to do that in Armin's voice because it's like the Armin voice I've been doing the whole game.
[199:37.07]The surviving Darkners, crushed by the darkness, will slowly, one by one, turn into statues, leaving the Lightners to fend for themselves.
[199:54.70]Lost eternally in an endless nightmare.
[199:57.56]I thought it was going to be a nightmare.
[200:02.43]Is that your idea of paradise?
[200:17.57]Oh, damn.
[200:18.19]I did not know that.
[200:21.39]You didn't?
[200:21.89]But your whole plan was to...
[200:24.93]I'm just a computer laughing my fucking ass off.
[200:28.57]I don't know everything.
[200:30.01]I was just guessing based off the night's actions.
[200:33.97]Why the heck would I want to end the world?
[200:38.70]That's a relief.
[200:42.30]Sorry, I... After everything, I just caused trouble for you again, Noelle.
[200:47.92]That's okay, Birdly.
[200:48.74]I understand.
[200:49.36]I thought about it while charging my battery.
[200:52.44]You cannot calculate other people's feelings.
[200:55.89]You understand how I feel?
[200:58.35]Not really.
[201:00.84]I just don't want Noelle to be sad.
[201:03.84]Well, I'm glad you two kind of get it now.
[201:07.54]Yes, we all made a pretty sweet team in the end.
[201:10.88]That was just the judge in the acid.
[201:19.39]No, we freaking didn't.
[201:22.71]Can you let go of us now?
[201:33.54]Susie?
[201:33.94]Hey, you stood up to the queen, not half bad.
[201:39.57]Really?
[201:41.09]Uh, yeah.
[201:43.31]Just guess you gotta wake up soon, huh?
[201:46.53]Huh?
[201:48.01]Everything got so intense, I forgot it was a dream.
[201:51.52]And I just hope I get to have more dreams like this.
[201:54.32]Hey, Noelle, when you wake up, um... Well, I just wanted to say, uh...
[202:06.95]Well, then I suppose it is time for you all to exit.
[202:10.72]Running program, tend to goodbye.exe.
[202:13.96]I will miss each and every one of you.
[202:17.02]Well, your unneeded honesty.
[202:19.16]Susie, your foolish bravery.
[202:21.17]Chris, your chill vibes.
[202:25.67]Burglary.
[202:27.55]Doesn't have to be goodbye, Queen.
[202:29.05]Chris can take you back to our castle town.
[202:31.75]You and all our recruits can live there.
[202:34.42]Whoa.
[202:37.79]Bleedingtendergoodbye.exe.
[202:41.87]All right, time to do what we came here for.
[202:43.26]Hey, Noel.
[202:45.64]If you see the real Susie, just know that maybe she's... Look, she doesn't have a tail, okay?
[202:56.43]Okay, got it.
[202:58.83]Just go, Chris.
[203:02.07]Everybody's laughing.
[203:20.18]Chris, it looks like we're here again.
[203:22.98]Oh.
[203:23.14]Roaring night.
[203:23.62]Whatever they are, they're making these fountains.
[203:26.99]Is that really a bad thing?
[203:46.73]since they started showing up.
[203:50.71]Everything's gotten a lot more interesting, hasn't it?
[203:58.83]Well, we don't have to think about it.
[204:02.24]That now.
[204:05.82]I'm doing Obama?
[204:08.04]I'm not trying to.
[204:08.90]Chris, it's your turn.
[204:16.37]It was as if your very soul was glowing.
[204:30.87]Guitar riff.
[204:41.63]Okay.
[204:42.61]Oh.
[204:44.30]What happened?
[204:46.07]Oh, it was a dream, wasn't it?
[204:48.97]Uh, a dream?
[204:50.71]That was all a dream?
[204:51.84]Oh.
[204:54.60]Of course, that must have been a dream.
[204:57.04]Such feelings, such thoughts.
[204:58.88]Oh, sweet lady of justice.
[205:01.96]I think I would ever think Susie would be... Susie?
[205:07.37]Susie?
[205:08.89]What are you doing here?
[205:09.97]Uh...
[205:14.09]You invited us to study, remember?
[205:15.49]Oh, right.
[205:17.43]I, uh... What?
[205:19.25]Studying with them?
[205:20.09]Noelle?
[205:22.20]Heavens to yikes.
[205:23.46]They're... Well, I guess we could try it.
[205:28.26]Huh?
[205:31.80]My alarm.
[205:32.50]Oh, I'm going to be late for shift with Miss Boom.
[205:37.66]Oh, no.
[205:38.06]How is it that late already?
[205:40.66]Well, adieu, everyone.
[205:42.18]I must gather my book longings.
[205:45.44]Ah, how I love the texture of freshly picked up books.
[205:49.42]Now, let us hasten, my dear Noelle.
[205:57.37]Good day, Chris, Susie.
[206:02.03]Bye, Chris.
[206:03.13]And, um, bye, Susie.
[206:06.43]Uh, see ya.
[206:12.70]What?
[206:13.10]What are you looking at for something?
[206:15.32]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[206:16.06]Bye, bye, bye, bye.
[206:19.70]Heck, is there a problem anyway?
[206:21.64]Way to treat someone who just saved the world.
[206:24.96]Look at me.
[206:26.34]Chris.
[206:26.98]Hey, wait a second.
[206:27.60]Chris.
[206:28.98]We just actually saved the world, didn't we?
[206:33.27]Damn, we really are heroes.
[206:35.13]And no one even knows.
[206:35.91]I guess it's better that way though, right?
[206:39.55]People would freak out if they knew the world's in danger.
[206:43.55]Well, it kind of sucks Noelle has to forget too.
[206:47.79]Whatever, let's get out of here.
[206:54.37]A recycling bin.
[206:55.39]Looks like someone accidentally printed off a lot of useless emails.
[207:02.55]Full of many backup devices like extra mice, extra keyboards, or extra maracas.
[207:08.86]Okay, what's back here?
[207:11.22]Closet is spacious and full of old electronics.
[207:14.67]Large person could easily fit inside.
[207:18.01]Computer, the monitor is flickering brightly.
[207:21.57]The trash can.
[207:22.21]You get the feeling it doesn't have any friends.
[207:23.67]It's hard to explain why you feel this way about a trash can.
[207:28.92]Huh.
[207:33.30]Before you left, you gathered up everything in the room.
[207:34.98]Okay.
[207:46.31]I love reading books.
[207:47.89]Especially the books upstairs.
[207:51.51]I love reading.
[207:52.03]Especially books.
[207:54.80]I love reading books.
[208:04.30]Man, it got late, didn't it?
[208:05.24]Guess you should go home, huh?
[208:09.76]Alright, you don't have to say it.
[208:14.74]Don't want to walk home by yourself, huh?
[208:17.74]Well, if you're gonna make me, I guess.
[208:20.76]Let's go.
[208:21.08]Here to make an appointment?
[208:33.17]Nah, just here to hang out.
[208:35.91]I see.
[208:36.29]I can actually go in all the way in here?
[208:42.46]Silver, Drake, I've never beaten this boss before.
[208:46.24]All right, hand it over, honey.
[208:47.30]I got this.
[208:48.90]No, Dad, this is my battle.
[208:50.70]So, um, how about just telling me what to do?
[208:54.82]Sure, how about trying fire shock?
[208:57.92]I'd love to, Dad, but the mage left a party.
[209:00.62]Oh, yeah, how about one of your 99 blaze potions?
[209:05.26]Uh, I'm saving those.
[209:07.19]What, your birthday?
[209:07.97]Come on, live a little.
[209:08.69]Okay, Dad, this one's for you.
[209:11.09]Hi-ya!
[209:14.01]Reflects fire attacks.
[209:16.99]Oops.
[209:17.77]Hey, you gotta heal.
[209:20.32]I wish I knew healing magic in real life.
[209:23.78]It'd make you better and it wouldn't just be me and mom.
[209:30.72]Mother is... Hey, it's okay, sweetheart.
[209:33.19]I'm getting better.
[209:34.83]I might even be able to go to church tomorrow.
[209:38.23]Really?
[209:38.87]Are you sure you're okay?
[209:41.93]All days happen whether you like it or not.
[209:44.79]Even though everyone likes holidays?
[209:47.53]Well, gotta go home soon or mom will call.
[209:51.99]See you tomorrow, honey.
[209:54.29]Bye, dad.
[209:54.63]Love you.
[209:56.61]Susie, what are you doing here?
[209:57.79]Sorry, guys.
[209:59.53]This game's only one player.
[210:02.33]Dad, this is Susie.
[210:04.58]Oh, this is Susie.
[210:06.46]Susie, I heard a lot about you.
[210:08.64]Dad, stop that.
[210:10.74]You have?
[210:12.10]Cool, think I have to go now.
[210:16.80]Susie, huh?
[210:20.78]Lay a finger on her and I'll kick your ass.
[210:22.74]Huh?
[210:25.58]I'm just kidding.
[210:27.34]Well, kind of kidding.
[210:36.93]Hey, Chris, why are you checking the sink?
[210:38.51]That's what I'm asking, sweetheart.
[210:41.17]I don't know.
[210:45.26]Sorry, I used up a lot of my energy just now.
[210:49.38]Probably not going to be very fun to talk to.
[210:51.60]Thanks for visiting, though, Chris.
[210:53.80]And you too, Susie.
[210:55.22]Susie, current situation, Noel.
[211:00.16]Current situation?
[211:02.42]Seems like I need some more tests.
[211:04.62]So just got to wait it out.
[211:06.48]They can't keep me down for too long, baby.
[211:09.44]Sooner or later, I'm busting out of here.
[211:14.00]Besides, your dad ain't much without his main man.
[211:20.72]What's this say?
[211:21.90]Patient named Rudolph Rudy Holliday.
[211:25.63]Chris, you forgot my name or something?
[211:34.17]Hmm.
[211:35.55]Is there anything else here?
[211:37.35]What's this?
[211:39.29]Looks like she's resting her voice.
[211:44.71]Look inside the cupboard.
[211:46.17]A very small obligatory piano is hiding inside.
[211:48.61]Hmm, okay.
[211:58.12]Oh Chris, you can play the piano?
[212:05.11]Whoops.
[212:05.41]There's more lore?
[212:08.17]Yeah.
[212:08.73]Let's see what else is here.
[212:13.16]All right, uh, Susie.
[212:16.86]Hey, Chris, she's a nice girl, huh?
[212:19.32]The hell are you talking... The hell are you taking her here for?
[212:23.33]Why don't you take her to the movies?
[212:27.05]Hey, yeah, the hell didn't we go to the movies, Chris?
[212:29.55]Yeah, and take me too while you're at it.
[212:33.47]Yeah, Chris, come on.
[212:35.21]Kettle corn, Chris, big.
[212:36.41]Don't skimp out.
[212:40.03]What is it?
[212:40.43]Christmas.
[212:40.85]Alright, uh, Noelle.
[212:44.19]Look, Chris, can't say much, but Noelle might look like she has it all.
[212:48.66]Her mother, mother, you know.
[212:51.02]Love her, but she's tough on her.
[212:53.84]Normally I balance it all out, but I can't do much when I'm not there.
[212:59.56]I'm gonna get better.
[213:00.81]I have to.
[213:01.23]Hmm.
[213:12.55]Beads of the toy march on.
[213:13.71]Uh-oh, Alfies.
[213:20.45]Hell if I'm gonna go any further.
[213:21.75]I'm already close enough to getting banned from school.
[213:25.11]Don't want to be banned from outside of school, too.
[213:28.29]That's a thing, right?
[213:33.28]Hi, Chris.
[213:34.06]Getting your project done?
[213:36.30]Oh, my bike?
[213:36.94]It's, um, it's, uh, I, I had a little crash.
[213:40.68]You see, there was this police officer and, uh, it's complicated.
[213:44.75]How are you doing?
[213:49.64]Chris, it's no secret the, uh, police in this town are, uh, how do I put this?
[213:53.86]Just, um, eye candy, I guess.
[213:56.68]Wait, wait, wait, that came out wrong.
[213:58.36]I mean, they're symbolic.
[213:59.72]They barely do anything.
[214:01.16]It's because of the mayor.
[214:02.16]There, uh, there isn't any crime.
[214:05.40]Makes me wonder if she even needs the police.
[214:08.00]Or if they're just getting in her way?
[214:10.91]Sorry, I'm just saying what you already know.
[214:13.07]After all, she's your neighbor, right?
[214:17.41]Do you need something?
[214:18.95]What's cool?
[214:20.89]How's your project going with Susie?
[214:23.36]What, you went to the library together?
[214:24.86]With Noelle and Birdly?
[214:26.50]That's amazing, Chris!
[214:28.64]While you were there, this has nothing to do with me, but the Teen Zone seems to have some good anime reviews, you know?
[214:34.60]I'm not sure if you and the gang were checking that out as you studied anime.
[214:40.02]Next time you go, you might want to casually bring that up among your fellow teens.
[214:44.45]I know your dad liked Mew Mew 2 at least.
[214:47.11]Again, nothing to do with me.
[214:55.97]by the infamous dog burglaries, the Wet Nose Bandits.
[214:59.21]We were getting ready to sneak into that big house over the holidays, and we were attacked from the shadows by something merciless.
[215:06.91]Fearing for our lives, we ran right into office Undyne's warm, loving arms.
[215:12.35]She suplexed us all into the snow while our tails hanging in the air.
[215:16.89]Now we're in jail, but at least we're alive.
[215:19.87]Plus, that nice ghost keeps giving us incorporally low-calorie treats.
[215:25.10]And we all howl holiday songs together.
[215:26.86]Is that a key?
[215:34.35]Hey, get out of the road.
[215:35.63]Oh, sorry.
[215:36.15]Bad habit.
[215:37.29]Anything I can help you with, punk?
[215:39.81]Dark world.
[215:41.67]A super dangerous alternate world in the library?
[215:44.19]More are appearing.
[215:46.12]People might fall inside.
[215:49.82]Listen, punk.
[215:51.48]You seriously think I'm going to believe that?
[215:53.97]Dark world.
[215:56.11]Seriously?
[215:58.21]Uh-oh.
[216:08.70]I love those guys.
[216:09.68]I hope they show up.
[216:10.94]Hey, wait.
[216:13.14]No, not again.
[216:15.08]Looks like I got to go recapture those criminals.
[216:18.72]Hey, by the way, that yellow glasses lady, is she a teacher?
[216:22.40]She kind of had an accident earlier with her, uh, bike.
[216:25.99]Just wanted to make sure she was feeling better.
[216:28.67]Uh, give her this.
[216:30.31]Got a heart-shaped box of candies that says, get well soon.
[216:33.34]It has to, it has to your bike hastily scrawled underneath the get well soon.
[216:39.83]Look, get well soon's all the store had.
[216:42.67]Open it and I'll arrest you, look.
[216:44.21]I'll even put a note on it.
[216:46.15]Now stop interrupting me, I gotta go.
[216:49.15]You got the previously described box, I can't even put a note on it.
[216:55.96]Oh, jailbreak.
[216:58.08]I'll solve the alarm.
[217:44.38]A box of heart-shaped chocolates?
[217:47.15]Oh, no, no, no, I can't accept that from you.
[217:49.81]What, it's from the police?
[217:52.07]You mean she's giving me this, uh, a get-well-soon gift to my bike?
[217:58.67]There's a note on this that says, open this and I'll arrest you, you little punk.
[218:03.02]Chris, I... Tell her I appreciate it.
[218:05.42]Alright, let's go.
[218:16.87]Oh, we were in the library already.
[218:18.53]What's up here?
[218:19.50]Hey Chris, shouldn't we check on Lancer?
[218:20.94]He should be back in the school closet, right?
[218:28.90]Sant!
[218:31.50]Hey, hey!
[218:33.90]Hey, hey, what's up?
[218:38.78]Occupation.
[218:40.52]Hey, you the boss around here?
[218:41.82]Oh, me?
[218:43.80]I'm just a janitor.
[218:46.84]And where's the cashier?
[218:49.16]Cashier?
[218:50.94]We don't have one.
[218:53.61]And who do we buy stuff from?
[218:57.17]Me.
[218:59.13]And that makes you the cashier?
[219:00.25]Nope.
[219:02.57]I'm the janitor.
[219:04.33]I'm just filling in.
[219:06.89]Are there any other employees?
[219:10.71]Nope.
[219:12.93]Then why don't you hire somebody else?
[219:15.61]Whoa, you think I can afford that on a janitor's salary?
[219:18.57]It's Bernie.
[219:19.19]Hey, let me tell you.
[219:20.17]It's Bernie Sanders.
[219:21.77]New voice.
[219:22.39]I'm trying to remember what I did last time.
[219:25.80]Hey, what's up?
[219:29.08]Sorry, kid.
[219:30.66]The brother thing's gonna have to wait.
[219:33.72]How long?
[219:35.10]Maybe a day, maybe another two years.
[219:37.51]Who's keeping track at this point?
[219:41.49]Hey, what's up?
[219:45.58]Welcome to the convenience store.
[219:47.76]You want to buy something?
[219:48.90]Put it in the basket and bring it over here.
[219:51.74]In case you didn't know what a store was.
[219:53.35]What the fuck?
[220:01.37]Hey, hey, you forgot something?
[220:05.71]Yes, I think I left my eggs on the counter.
[220:08.94]Guess your memory is not what it's cracked up to be.
[220:13.87]There's really egg on my face now, is there not?
[220:15.67]Oh, you're egg-scused.
[220:20.69]Now it sounds as if you're egging me on.
[220:22.23]Egg on or egg off, I expect a lot from you.
[220:28.07]Well, I am exceptional.
[220:30.47]Don't forget me, your egg's husband.
[220:36.13]Eh, hello, Asgore.
[220:38.98]Horriger, I didn't expect to see you here, but I... I have some extra flowers and I was wondering if... Oh, I was just about to go, actually.
[220:49.36]Oh, sure.
[220:50.98]Home is where the heart is, isn't it?
[220:55.56]Uh, so when Asriel comes home... Yes, we should all discuss that together soon.
[221:01.09]Donkey Donkey, say hi to Chris for me.
[221:05.03]Of course, have a nice day.
[221:05.81]You know what I want, bone man?
[221:13.82]Uh, yep.
[221:15.08]Free pickles.
[221:17.30]Why, thank you.
[221:18.02]Can I ask, what kind of flowers do you think would make her remember how she felt before?
[221:29.24]Uh, maybe you should talk to your plants about that one.
[221:31.30]Oh, I've changed it.
[221:33.86]Why?
[221:34.32]What happened?
[221:34.72]Haha, don't worry, they're the first ones I asked.
[221:39.08]They're such good listeners, you know?
[221:40.94]Flowers.
[221:43.18]Well, yeah, nothing like a captive audience.
[221:45.66]He's changing.
[221:48.04]Yes, haha, I keep them in glass.
[221:51.29]He's turning into... What's he turning into?
[221:56.43]Yes, haha, I...
[221:58.49]He's turning into Barney Rubble.
[222:00.85]That's the same shit happened last time in Undertale.
[222:03.09]I like that movie.
[222:06.14]Yes, yes.
[222:06.66]It's very similar to that movie.
[222:09.98]Well, have a good one.
[222:12.44]I'm trying.
[222:13.20]Hey, Chris.
[222:18.32]Never mind.
[222:24.06]Yeah, I'm the sicko that looks at all the milks to find the best expiration date.
[222:27.80]You got something about it?
[222:32.42]Sometimes the hoofed girl comes here, opens the freezer door, then stands in front of it lost in thought.
[222:38.36]Guess she really likes the cold or waffles.
[222:44.24]Okay, well that's cool.
[222:50.10]Sans runs the convenience store.
[222:52.64]Can I do that?
[222:54.18]Loose eggs, $1.
[222:55.64]It's too much responsibility for an egg.
[223:00.39]What time is it?
[223:03.69]Alright, I... I told the... Let's see.
[223:11.76]I told the Tip of the Hats guys that I was going to be around around 6.
[223:17.60]And we're at 6 o'clock right now, so...
[223:22.58]Am I almost done?
[223:33.02]School has a save point.
[223:34.28]Save your game in the school.
[223:36.14]There's like 15 minutes left.
[223:39.02]Let me just real... I'm going to go to BRB screen for a second.
[223:42.40]Because I want to see how long they're going to go for.
[223:45.40]See if I can go another 15 minutes or so.
[223:48.63]Give me one second.
[223:49.67]I just want to hit up, um... I'll be right back, and I'm gonna pee too.
[224:18.21]Thank you.
[225:02.39]Thanks for watching!
[225:43.04]Thank you.
[226:13.99]you
[227:17.69]Alrighty.
[227:19.63]I dropped a few messages to them.
[227:23.37]We're gonna go until... I guess maybe they...
[227:28.03]So somebody says, hey, come on over.
[227:30.61]I think we have probably another 10 to 15 minutes, so let's do it.
[227:32.85]I'm going to keep this open so I don't miss a message, though.
[227:35.81]All right.
[227:47.32]Keep that open.
[227:48.36]There we are.
[227:49.78]Okay, good.
[227:50.30]Go back to the school to save your game.
[227:54.88]Okay.
[227:54.98]What is this?
[227:57.75]You kids came out of the library, didn't you?
[227:59.45]Studying?
[227:59.93]How wonderful.
[228:01.07]Personally, I hate libraries, but, you know.
[228:03.51]There's like 10 minutes left?
[228:05.67]Yeah, I don't need to explore every single little thing.
[228:08.43]If I want to talk to every single citizen, I can do that.
[228:12.21]Like, on my own time.
[228:14.29]Faintly, faintly, a trussle growing further away.
[228:17.37]Wait, what?
[228:20.37]Faintly, faintly, a trussle growing further away.
[228:28.41]Knock, knock, knock.
[228:29.11]Ooh, is that a human?
[228:30.41]If humans are made of bones, where does skeletons come from?
[228:33.43]Alright, let's head to the school.
[228:39.91]We'll complete it.
[228:40.39]Somebody said you could have finished it in the time that you've been gone.
[228:45.33]Well, I wanted to tell them, because we kind of said that around 6 o'clock I'd poke them and see what they were up to.
[228:53.03]I want to make sure that I'm communicating, right?
[228:55.57]Oh, hey, that's my trash from other people's houses.
[228:58.58]Like, privacy much?
[228:59.66]God, living with Azzy made you weird.
[229:06.36]Like, little Chrissy, you hear, that guy at the pizza place.
[229:10.28]God, what was his name?
[229:11.20]Pizza Pants?
[229:11.94]He already got, like, a super hot girlfriend.
[229:15.72]What was her name?
[229:16.46]Like, uh, Pizzarina?
[229:20.04]Anyway, what did you like?
[229:21.12]Want to talk?
[229:22.26]Okay.
[229:26.89]Chrissy, like, guess what?
[229:28.87]Today I, like, went to the beach to play with my uke, and, like, guess who's already there?
[229:34.88]That copycat playing the same song I wanted to play.
[229:38.32]Oh my god, cat on the beach, grody.
[229:41.50]Did she, like, get lost looking for the litter box?
[229:44.76]So, like, I try to, like, play the same song too, to, like, you know, assert my ukulele dominance, and we end up, oh, get this, playing the whole song together.
[229:55.60]Like, oh my god, who does this girl think she is?
[229:59.20]She thinks she can just, like, harmonize with me?
[230:01.48]Uh, I can't stand her.
[230:07.05]Little Chrissy, come to visit me.
[230:09.19]I'm a real alligator, aren't I?
[230:12.51]Oh my god, it's like so sweet you have a nasty dirty little friend But like this is my polluted alleyway So like I think I might have to go to the mayor and get a traffic sign That says like no plus ones because like okay What is that?
[230:29.23]Hey Chris this free milk is amazing Just magically refreshes itself over every night
[230:41.21]Hey, Chrissy, like, guess what?
[230:42.97]Today, I like- Oh, wait, I already did this.
[230:44.37]Okay, that's- Alright, let's go.
[230:52.82]I wanna explore!
[230:53.56]Alright, let's go to the school.
[230:57.06]I'm gonna- Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[231:06.23]Whose house is this?
[231:11.24]Is that all it's down?
[231:16.92]Where's the school?
[231:19.66]The school.
[231:22.88]Oh, it's the church.
[231:24.74]Just a spot.
[231:26.46]Nothing like admiring the great paint job me and my bro did on our church.
[231:33.36]Mount Hall.
[231:33.96]No sense of direction.
[231:34.76]Well, I mean, I haven't been here in a long time.
[231:39.87]Graveyard?
[231:44.05]One of my best ideas came from dreams.
[231:49.00]Take a rest here if anyone asks your writing.
[231:54.32]He's confused west with east again.
[231:56.11]I feel like I could literally walk around here for like an hour and a half and just listen to every single thing.
[232:00.85]And I'm probably gonna do that.
[232:02.03]I'll do that like later tonight before I go to bed.
[232:09.09]I do want to be... I don't want to just cut into their time.
[232:12.67]I did tell them a certain time.
[232:14.73]So, let's go ahead and end the process here.
[232:19.01]Go right.
[232:25.80]Down and left.
[232:27.02]Right at the library to finish.
[232:32.12]School is not the end.
[232:37.95]I have the game saved like 10 minutes before this, so that's fine.
[232:42.48]So this is the school and the game.
[232:46.76]Just finish it.
[232:49.96]The end of the game is your... Yeah, I can walk around.
[232:52.10]I'm going to do this probably on my own time.
[232:53.56]Just explore everything and talk to everybody.
[232:57.77]We can finish the game.
[233:01.45]So where's the houses?
[233:04.17]The secrets after the school?
[233:04.99]Yeah.
[233:05.15]Yeah.
[233:07.35]Oh, the school's a save point.
[233:09.01]Ah, alright.
[233:09.31]But I want to, like, finish- I want to end the game, though.
[233:16.82]Do school first.
[233:22.24]Door's locked.
[233:25.80]What the fuck?
[233:31.35]No, wait.
[233:31.81]You made me go in the school.
[233:33.07]You said there was a save point.
[233:36.23]What the fuck?
[233:41.57]So this is your castle town.
[233:43.47]It's not bad.
[233:45.53]Chris, Susie, on behalf of everyone, I oppressed.
[233:49.15]Thank you.
[233:52.63]Oh, the save point in the town.
[233:53.49]Okay.
[233:54.37]I'm going to be your wacky roommate now.
[233:57.57]I thought you guys were putting me to the next part of the game.
[234:04.05]Chris, I bet you have a lot of people to talk to, but you don't have to do everything at once.
[234:08.36]Save and take a break.
[234:10.00]I know, you're in chat right now.
[234:11.38]Where's the save point?
[234:14.56]Up here?
[234:18.92]You thought about how you can't go back to the cyber world anymore.
[234:21.35]You consider this carefully.
[234:24.39]Okay, there we go.
[234:25.03]Now let's complete the game.
[234:33.13]Now let's go home.
[234:35.17]Then I can come back here and walk around and talk to everybody.
[234:39.05]So now home is where from here?
[234:43.85]Yeah, it's at the top of the town somewhere, right?
[234:56.77]This is it here.
[234:57.25]Alright.
[234:58.71]Chris, you going home?
[234:59.43]Yep.
[235:01.35]Alright.
[235:02.86]Then I guess it's goodbye for today.
[235:05.12]See you tomorrow, Chris.
[235:08.86]Chris, how is studying with your... Why, Chris, is that your friend?
[235:14.40]Did he... I did spam it already, yeah.
[235:19.78]Why don't you invite her inside?
[235:20.80]Uh, I mean, I...
[235:23.79]Chris, I should probably get going.
[235:26.37]And... I was gonna bake a pie.
[235:28.67]Did you want anything?
[235:29.45]I guess I can come over for a bit?
[235:32.06]Feel free to come in.
[235:47.19]Oh, excuse me.
[235:47.79]I'm Chris's mother, Toriel.
[235:50.62]Yes, ma'am.
[235:51.40]I remember.
[235:51.82]Oh, you do?
[235:53.56]And you are Susie, are you not?
[235:56.66]Oh, you remember my name, too?
[236:00.66]Of course.
[236:01.34]Miss Alfie's is a good friend of mine.
[236:03.82]She often talks about you.
[236:06.38]Uh, glad to hear it.
[236:08.74]What the hell is Alfie saying about me?
[236:11.40]Susie, why don't you wash your hands over there?
[236:14.21]Then we can make the pie together.
[236:15.39]Make it together?
[236:18.79]But I don't know how to.
[236:19.83]Do not worry.
[236:21.55]I can teach you.
[236:23.33]Okay.
[236:26.54]Chris, Susie seems like a nice girl.
[236:27.90]I'm very happy you're friends with her.
[236:30.28]But... Chris, I heard from Alfie's about her behavior.
[236:35.96]If by any chance she influences you... Leave the chalk alone, all right?
[236:43.67]Hands, uh, washed.
[236:46.53]Wonderful.
[236:47.25]Now we can... Oh, Chris, how about you show Susie how to bake it?
[236:52.61]Chris, you know how to make pie?
[236:53.57]The hell have you made me any for?
[236:56.07]What, dumbass?
[236:57.87]You pie-hoarding piece of... I mean, uh, excuse me, ma'am.
[237:03.92]Susie, you can just call me Toriel outside of school.
[237:07.28]Oh, okay, sweet.
[237:10.04]Uh, Chris, oh, you need to wash your hands, too.
[237:12.72]And I suppose I shall teach Susie for now.
[237:15.38]Susie and I will start getting ready to make the pie.
[237:17.14]Uh, wait, what?
[237:19.54]It's a TV.
[237:29.52]I'm making a pie.
[237:30.06]She's sneaking sugar right out of the bag.
[237:34.22]Susie?
[237:36.37]What?
[237:37.59]My pie, my rules.
[237:39.89]Got it.
[237:42.91]I couldn't do that.
[237:48.29]It's the bathroom sink.
[237:49.53]Will you run the tap?
[237:50.47]Yes.
[237:50.69]Started to run.
[237:53.65]It's making a lot of noise.
[238:04.55]How about this again?
[238:05.16]Why does he keep doing this?
[238:41.24]I mean, dude, there are way better ways to hide you shitting in the bathroom, by the way.
[238:47.30]What the fuck?
[238:56.43]Well, let us get the flower.
[238:58.99]That's this bag.
[239:00.43]And you just... Oops.
[239:03.65]Susie, you have flour on your nose.
[239:07.30]I meant to do that.
[239:09.70]Thought you would stop to smell the flower, eh?
[239:16.08]Come on!
[239:17.56]Now on to the next part.
[239:22.59]Where the... Where the heck is Chris?
[239:26.03]Oh, Chris does this sometimes.
[239:29.99]They should hurry, I'm getting sleepy.
[239:31.17]You know what they call a sleeping Susie?
[239:36.86]Uh, what?
[239:38.51]They would call her, uh, Snoozy.
[239:41.93]Uh, haha.
[239:43.45]Then, then I guess you'd be, uh, Snorial.
[239:48.34]Hahaha, Snorial!
[239:50.22]Snoozy and Snorial!
[239:52.94]Uh, yeah, you really liked that one, huh?
[239:56.13]Wasn't it funny?
[239:56.79]Alright, where the hell is Chris?
[240:04.63]Pie is nearly done.
[240:06.55]Oh, the sugar!
[240:07.05]Wait, here a moment.
[240:07.73]I left it in the car.
[240:09.71]Okay.
[240:19.75]What?
[240:39.73]Did he get the heart?
[240:43.13]Okay, this is some weird shit.
[240:45.23]He's taking the heart out and he's like killing people in town or something.
[240:48.43]He takes the heart out and he just does some weird shit outside.
[240:51.65]What is he doing?
[240:52.07]Why does he keep doing that?
[240:52.78]... ...
[241:11.53]Hey Chris, hurry up next time.
[241:12.65]We're already almost done.
[241:29.75]What's next?
[241:30.23]Is it they?
[241:32.63]Oh.
[241:33.17]They go by they, them.
[241:34.77]Okay.
[241:39.67]We already worked quite hard, have we not?
[241:42.05]How about we finish it later?
[241:43.25]How about we finish it?
[241:49.07]Uh, okay.
[241:53.20]Then I guess I'll walk home.
[241:54.48]Oh no, there's no need to do that.
[242:00.40]Oh, actually.
[242:02.10]Susie, would you like to stay over?
[242:03.36]Huh?
[242:06.36]I mean, um, if it's okay, then...
[242:09.55]Here come the chimpanzees.
[242:18.06]Here comes the chimpanzee.
[242:19.38]Everyone's... What's going on?
[242:27.41]Every character that I control always just becomes like me, in a way.
[242:32.86]As I'm walking around.
[242:35.04]I tend to just say he.
[242:37.40]Because I put it as me, essentially.
[242:39.60]That's kind of how it works for me.
[242:42.81]Yeah, that's fine.
[242:43.59]That's cool.
[242:46.37]It always kind of becomes like an extension of me.
[242:48.15]Like walking around in a circle.
[242:50.55]If that makes any sense.
[242:53.32]Hey, look at this!
[242:58.50]Our couch is used to being used as a bed.
[243:03.92]It's not perfect, but we could all sleep out here.
[243:05.70]We could all sleep out here?
[243:08.30]That sounds too- Oh, get the sleeping bag!
[243:11.63]Splendid, I'll make sure everything's in order.
[243:13.13]So why do I keep ripping my heart out and attacking people or something?
[243:21.65]Just call your parents, will you not?
[243:22.97]Yeah, of course.
[243:32.64]So what the hell?
[243:33.74]What the hell?
[243:34.20]A sleepover?
[243:34.96]I haven't had one of those in forever.
[243:37.30]We're going to watch every single episode of Rugrats.
[243:43.22]All of them.
[243:44.86]It's not like someone has to tell you to sit, right?
[243:48.75]Here, chill out for a sec.
[243:52.61]So now what?
[243:55.79]I got it.
[243:57.05]Maybe between the pillows here.
[243:58.65]There.
[243:59.67]I knew I'd find the boat in there.
[244:05.03]You can always find good stuff wedged in the couch.
[244:09.93]Jeez, it's dusty.
[244:10.89]When did you last use this thing?
[244:13.39]Well, who cares?
[244:13.97]It's just watch TV.
[244:14.87]So what are we going to marathon tonight?
[244:19.35]Blood Crushers 3, Hellbusters, Invasion of the Cat Petters?
[244:25.45]Maybe Ice-E.
[244:26.33]The movie's more your speed, huh, Chris?
[244:29.24]Ha ha ha ha!
[244:29.84]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[244:32.84]It's been a good day, huh, Chris?
[244:35.48]You, Rousey, Lancer, everyone.
[244:37.91]It's just cool hanging out together.
[244:41.59]That's why, you know, don't you think we should try to have them come to our world?
[244:45.49]Come on, think about how much better it would be.
[244:47.89]Rousey could do our homework, Lancer could live under your bed.
[244:52.08]We could all walk to school together.
[244:55.70]Perfect, you know?
[244:57.44]We would be unstoppable, is what I'm saying.
[245:03.35]Um, I don't know.
[245:04.17]That seems, doesn't that seem, isn't it like a different world?
[245:11.41]Maybe that's like a, it'd be hard to do that.
[245:13.10]We could try.
[245:15.90]That seems, they, I don't know, that seems a little far-fetched.
[245:26.69]What?
[245:26.85]Come on, it'd be easy.
[245:28.15]Razzy looks like your mom, right?
[245:29.49]Just say he's a long-lost cousin, it'd be easy.
[245:33.33]Lancer could even make him a fake mustache.
[245:35.27]Oh, whatever.
[245:36.69]Let's just get back to watching.
[245:38.09]Is that a cat?
[245:44.70]The festival's coming up, right?
[245:46.46]The thing where the town becomes a carnival?
[245:49.84]Stupid, right?
[245:55.75]Say you had to, uh, take someone.
[245:58.15]Noelle or Rousey, uh,
[246:03.65]Um, I would probably take, I'd probably, I honestly would probably go with Rousey.
[246:09.03]Like, you and, you and Noelle could do, you could do that.
[246:11.91]Right?
[246:13.59]I'll take Rousey.
[246:14.91]Why are you saying it so confused?
[246:16.43]I, it's not like I meant anything weird.
[246:18.47]You know what?
[246:19.89]Forget it.
[246:21.35]Well, no, I'm just saying, like, you and Noelle can go, will go, like, we'll just go.
[246:25.67]Why can't we just go together?
[246:26.43]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[246:31.69]Giant monster movie special.
[246:34.13]Always liked them better than the giant human movies.
[246:36.07]Now this is something we can marathon.
[246:38.23]You ready, Chris?
[246:40.49]12 hours of building, bashing, car crunching action, because we are locked in.
[246:44.33]Got it?
[246:45.37]Better not see you move until your eyes bloodshot.
[246:50.01]Now let me just get comfortable here.
[246:53.81]There.
[247:01.99]Susie fell asleep.
[247:04.20]Already?
[247:05.74]That tends to happen, though.
[247:06.54]It really does.
[247:11.50]What is going on?
[247:12.18]Why does this keep happening?
[247:16.78]Oh, I thought the heart was going to come out again.
[247:22.54]Officer?
[247:23.14]Officer?
[247:29.13]Thank goodness, I finally got through.
[247:31.43]I thought I saw someone prowling around outside.
[247:33.65]And when I checked our car, the tires looked like they'd been slashed.
[247:39.19]Officer, if you could please come over.
[247:41.11]You will soon, thank you.
[247:50.72]They're already asleep.
[247:59.65]Not gonna happen again, right?
[248:06.63]Maybe it will?
[248:13.59]Oh, God.
[248:14.13]There it is again.
[248:42.61]Oh god.
[249:00.89]Oh, you're making the fountains!
[249:04.89]You're making the fountains!
[249:15.78]You're making fountains.
[249:21.24]Ah.
[249:22.74]Why?
[249:27.58]Chris is the knight.
[249:31.79]Are we gonna get the... Come on, do it.
[249:39.79]Oh.
[249:41.45]Well shit.
[249:48.28]What's going on?
[249:50.30]This feels weird.
[249:53.23]Oh, I thought it was crashing.
[249:54.45]I thought it was a skipping CD.
[250:02.25]Alright, that was cool.
[250:06.44]That was good.
[250:15.46]You want to give it a rating?
[250:21.47]Although, I'm currently talking to Sturck.
[250:29.07]Uh, give it a rating.
[250:29.87]Alright, I'm gonna give that one a... I refuse to rate it until the whole thing's out.
[250:33.99]There you go.
[250:41.11]Half a three.
[250:42.42]That was very good, though.
[250:43.08]That was really fun.
[250:45.28]That was, uh, exactly what I thought it was gonna be.
[250:47.74]Exactly what I expected.
[250:50.92]The weird part about this is I'm surprised.
[250:52.46]This is going to be seven chapters.
[250:54.48]That seems like a lot.
[250:59.98]That seems like a lot more to do.
[251:04.48]Seven.
[251:09.15]See you when you're 50.
[251:16.41]Toby said three to five are coming out around the same time.
[251:19.43]You know, that would make sense.
[251:22.65]There's another route for, you know, 3, 4, 5 are in the same release.
[251:26.78]Yeah, because this is no longer free anymore, right?
[251:29.16]Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are a paid thing.
[251:31.78]So they're going to be one thing that's paid, right?
[251:35.08]Yeah.
[251:35.24]I mean, that's... Look, that's... Being able to actually just check it out, because this is called the demo, right?
[251:42.52]You get the first two chapters for free, and then if you want to pay for it and you like it, you can just keep going.
[251:51.10]Oh, that's cool.
[251:53.25]That's really cool.
[251:54.30]I mean, that's what's been four, eight.
[251:58.22]The first time I played through was like six or seven, maybe.
[252:01.80]It's like almost 15 to 18 hours of content I've gotten for free.
[252:05.94]So yeah, I absolutely would pay for the next ones for sure.
[252:08.78]There's a lot more to see.
[252:18.75]All right, I am going to send you guys, because we're pressed for time.
[252:22.39]It's not going to be an outro to this stream.
[252:24.45]What's going to happen here is I'm going to send you guys over to the tip of the hat stream right now.
[252:29.94]And I will see you if you go over there and you want to hang out for, I don't know how much longer.
[252:34.79]I think they're going to be live for a little bit longer.
[252:38.37]And I'm going to go from there.
[252:39.83]I'm going to take a quick little break.
[252:41.19]We're going to raid Tip of the Hats.
