[00:05.29]Hey.
[00:07.57]How are you?
[00:10.73]The VOD?
[00:11.31]Yeah, well, I mean... This is the start of the VOD, you're right.
[00:18.25]How are you doing?
[00:24.27]Give me one second.
[00:24.91]Did the tweet go through?
[00:26.03]Let me check.
[00:41.66]Yeah, it did.
[00:43.18]Good afternoon everybody, or good evening.
[00:46.36]Show us the green.
[00:47.30]Today is not the green screen stream.
[00:51.10]The green screen stream is scheduled for Thursday.
[00:57.30]So, Thursday gets you a solid time.
[01:04.73]What's happening today?
[01:06.79]Well, I figured we'd just hang out for a little bit.
[01:09.07]Chat and talk about, uh... You know, about my taxes, and maybe you guys can help me with them.
[01:15.98]Trying to figure out what is and wasn't an expense.
[01:18.44]You know, it's hard stuff.
[01:23.16]Now, I'm probably going to play L.A.
[01:24.48]Noire and Red Dead 2, and then maybe a little bit of...
[01:31.40]The new... What was that new... Not Binding of Isaac.
[01:34.91]Whatever it was.
[01:37.33]Both games?
[01:37.99]Oh, no.
[01:43.10]I think we're good.
[01:44.20]Oh, there I am.
[01:44.82]Oh, hi.
[01:46.50]Hi, the webcam works.
[01:49.00]Delta... Oh, that Delta ruin.
[01:50.06]That's what it was.
[01:50.52]Binding of Isaac.
[01:51.14]Why did I think of Binding of Isaac?
[01:53.19]Strange.
[01:54.63]Anyways, we'll just take a minute here.
[01:57.21]I can turn off the intro.
[01:59.43]Oh, no.
[01:59.87]Maybe the intro should stay on for a little longer.
[02:01.75]What do you think?
[02:04.65]I'm weird about my intros, man.
[02:08.19]I leave my... Normal streamers, right?
[02:11.05]If you're a normal streamer.
[02:13.31]How, uh... How long do you have your intro on for?
[02:19.88]More than five minutes?
[02:23.48]One minute?
[02:25.84]Thirty minutes?
[02:28.24]Thirty minutes?
[02:32.46]Oh, it's been three minutes.
[02:34.02]Should I give it five minutes?
[02:35.77]I don't have any time frame here.
[02:42.89]30 seconds.
[02:48.37]Well, regardless.
[02:49.07]10 minutes is good.
[02:54.24]5 minutes is alright for me, I think.
[02:58.40]So, I mean, we're at 4 minutes now.
[03:02.32]You're always talking before I get the alert and come in.
[03:04.66]Alright, so I need to learn how to do this then.
[03:06.96]I need to learn how to stream.
[03:09.42]So I hit the start streaming button.
[03:12.22]But I want people to know that I didn't accidentally press start streaming.
[03:15.32]You know?
[03:17.00]Whatever.
[03:18.64]We can turn it off.
[03:19.22]Let's just get to what I want to do.
[03:21.26]I want to hang out for a little bit.
[03:25.43]I don't know what this is.
[03:26.79]This is different.
[03:27.43]This is like vertical video on a cell phone.
[03:32.01]And no, there's no green screen back here.
[03:34.99]Take a look.
[03:36.24]See, it's not like... Oh, he's going to fall through it!
[03:38.06]This is just...
[03:40.82]See?
[03:41.42]This is a wall.
[03:43.16]This is really a wall.
[03:46.02]How weird would it be if I was inside of a box inside of a green screen?
[03:52.00]But whatever.
[03:54.54]I like your Nightwing shirt.
[03:55.52]I did too.
[03:57.25]So today I just figured we wouldn't really do much.
[04:00.89]Probably sit around and do it wider.
[04:02.83]I don't feel like doing it.
[04:04.85]It's too far away from me.
[04:10.84]Chill stream.
[04:11.38]We're just going to hang out, talk, relax.
[04:17.07]Be a little lazy, you know.
[04:18.69]Be a little bit lazy today.
[04:20.43]That's kind of what we're doing.
[04:23.21]But L.A.
[04:23.83]Noire is on the list.
[04:26.00]So is Red Dead 2.
[04:28.90]But we haven't had an opportunity to do this.
[04:30.60]Just to sit here.
[04:33.78]You know?
[04:35.30]It hasn't been very much of an opportunity for us to just kind of hang out here.
[04:45.89]Because, I mean... Sorry, I've got a little bit of wine here, don't mind me.
[04:53.18]This is wine, you know?
[04:56.12]I only drink wine during one particular type of stream.
[05:01.59]I'm not sure...
[05:05.62]Mmm.
[05:06.42]That's nice.
[05:06.80]That's fruity.
[05:08.63]That's got some notes to it.
[05:09.69]That's got some blueberry in an oak cask.
[05:13.83]But, you know, the only time that I ever drink wine on stream is when I'm doing something very particular on camera.
[05:24.49]Why is it not in a cup?
[05:25.73]It isn't a cup.
[05:31.40]But let's speed it up here because I think a lot of people are probably really curious as to what the deal is.
[05:37.34]I'm going to go ahead and switch it over to L.A.
[05:39.14]Noire because that's exactly what we're doing.
[05:41.64]And we're definitely not doing the Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit.
[06:05.82]Yeah, that's right.
[06:06.34]We're politely doing the Labo today.
[06:10.18]Anytime, anytime I put wine in a glass.
[06:15.82]Let's go ahead and put me down here.
[06:17.87]Down here where I belong in the corner here.
[06:21.71]Oh, what's that I hear?
[06:22.79]Do you guys hear that?
[06:23.99]You guys hear that?
[06:33.68]Oh, okay.
[06:35.80]Where is it though?
[06:36.88]It should be here.
[06:42.02]The best part about this is I was supposed to do this yesterday.
[06:46.12]You understand?
[06:48.44]I was supposed to be in the middle of L.A.
[06:51.00]Noire and just open this box and start doing it.
[06:54.20]So that didn't really work out because there's a couple of problems there.
[06:59.87]But, who gives a shit?
[07:01.89]Like, we're here now and we're gonna do it now.
[07:04.43]I'm excited for it.
[07:05.35]I know like 60% of the audience is like, I can't believe I'm doing this again.
[07:10.61]But, let's go ahead and open it.
[07:24.08]I need to move this foot.
[07:25.73]Whoop-dee-oh, hit the, oh boy, bump the bike, whoops.
[07:29.32]Oh boy, this is a little... I don't know how I'm gonna, like, do this.
[07:34.36]I don't have enough room for this.
[07:38.83]This is so cr- You guys don't understand, this is like... I don't have anything...
[07:48.91]I can't move.
[07:49.37]I'm stuck here.
[07:50.65]Do you understand?
[07:51.41]Like this is locking me in.
[07:53.81]And the camera's right here.
[08:01.91]That's good wine too, by the way.
[08:05.03]Oh Jerma, what kind of expensive wine are you drinking tonight?
[08:07.47]Well, you know, the finest in fucking box wine.
[08:15.66]I gotta be careful with that, though.
[08:17.88]Because, like, if that shit... Like, I can't spill any of that.
[08:23.58]So, say goodbye, honestly, if you think there's gonna be, like, a spill the fucking wine joke tonight.
[08:29.21]No, no, no, no, I'm not, I, no, that's not gonna happen, I can't afford that.
[08:34.17]Anyways, we're gonna just... We need to get this fucking thing out of here.
[08:37.22]Let's do make.
[08:38.80]Because... I'm ready to go.
[08:42.38]Am I having problems?
[08:43.36]Please take a picture of this QR code.
[08:49.61]There we go.
[08:50.31]Okay, so I don't even know what pieces I need.
[08:52.02]This is gonna be...
[08:54.05]Apparently, from all the reviews I've read, this is apparently way, way more fun.
[08:59.09]It has, the games are actually like three or four times better than, I don't know why three or four is the number of new here.
[09:04.83]Apparently it's like three times better game-wise than the other Labos.
[09:08.34]This is the, apparently the other Labos were dog shit in comparison.
[09:11.26]So, we'll find out.
[09:13.78]Uh, I got my, I got my controllers here.
[09:17.00]Okay, I'm ready.
[09:17.94]Let's go ahead and make.
[09:21.34]First, we'll practice.
[09:22.34]I don't need to practice.
[09:23.74]I already know how to make the fucking popcorn holder.
[09:25.71]I don't need to do this.
[09:26.39]Oh, I gotta change this from just chatting.
[09:31.27]To Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit.
[09:36.53]Vehicle Kit.
[09:42.02]Let Labo go.
[09:43.08]Let's... Just how about Vehicle...
[09:55.49]How about, uh... Making car... Automobile factory.
[10:01.03]Well, it's not just cars.
[10:02.09]Vehicle factory.
[10:04.53]Vehicle factory, one worker.
[10:08.84]Right?
[10:09.06]Because, I mean, that would be kind of fucked up, but that's reality here.
[10:15.64]I gotta make them all.
[10:17.62]Okay, labo.
[10:23.30]Okay, it's done.
[10:25.40]I'm ready.
[10:27.92]This is actually kind of good.
[10:28.82]This is a red blend, California red blend from Black Box Premium Blocks Wines.
[10:37.97]My plan is, you know, to stall.
[10:41.77]No, don't stall.
[10:42.65]This shit takes like eight hours to build.
[10:45.25]Don't stop stalling.
[10:46.35]It's going to be like a nine and a half hour stream.
[10:49.16]Look at how good I look right now.
[10:50.60]I look fresh.
[10:51.70]I look well rested.
[10:53.36]Fast forward seven and a half hours from now.
[10:56.40]I bet you my hair is greasy.
[10:57.60]My face is watery.
[10:58.98]And like I got stains under my armpits.
[11:02.18]$50 just came in.
[11:06.18]Baked Flakes, thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.
[11:10.12]And he says, Italic says you have small cups.
[11:13.99]How dare you force germacized cups onto your housemates?
[11:17.23]Eat these bits on stream.
[11:24.34]This is eight ounces.
[11:27.18]This is what a human being is supposed to consume for a serving.
[11:31.30]Six to eight ounces.
[11:33.49]Just stop going to Burger King and getting the large like 38 ounce fucking beverage.
[11:38.87]It's gonna kill you one day.
[11:41.39]This is the amount of ounces for one serving.
[11:43.97]You know you drink those bottles of water, those are 16.9 fluid ounces.
[11:47.02]That's two servings.
[11:49.04]Call a doctor and ask him.
[11:54.16]Call a doctor!
[11:57.34]Call a doctor and ask!
[12:04.29]I don't even think he can hear me.
[12:07.31]But thanks for the $50, man.
[12:08.77]So much.
[12:09.11]Seriously.
[12:09.45]I don't need practice.
[12:11.57]Thank you, Big Flakes.
[12:12.63]That's a lot of money.
[12:15.85]We already know this part.
[12:20.32]Okay, that was weird.
[12:21.14]Go.
[12:22.12]Go.
[12:23.08]I already know this part.
[12:24.00]Is there a way to skip the baby shit?
[12:29.48]I think we have to do this.
[12:33.38]Yeah, if you hold this, I don't even need this baby shit.
[12:38.68]Yeah, hold these and go back and forth.
[12:41.24]More baby shit.
[12:44.94]It's a game for little kids.
[12:46.12]Actually, one of the reviewers said that it took him and his son a very long time to make it.
[12:53.16]He said that, you know, it was really hard for me.
[12:56.18]My son was there too, but I thought it was pretty difficult at points.
[12:58.94]And I'm like, okay, well... Alright.
[13:07.87]Stop making things up.
[13:08.83]I swear to God that's a review for this Labo.
[13:11.03]Just type in Labo review me and my son or something and you'll just find it.
[13:15.48]Do like how people find anything on the internet.
[13:24.06]You're the father, congrats.
[13:29.23]Shave your scruff.
[13:32.99]I, I, listen.
[13:35.99]Anytime that I shave,
[13:38.72]I only have to shave like once a week because my face should grow so slow and so erratically that, and I have sensitive skin, right?
[13:45.39]I have sensitive teeth.
[13:46.93]So I need special toothpaste and I need special shaving cream because if I shave, I get red and itchy and it's bad.
[13:54.03]So I have to use sensitive toothpaste for my sensitive teeth and then sensitive soap for my sensitive face.
[13:59.71]I don't want to shave every day.
[14:00.89]Alright, so we're going to make a pedal.
[14:06.37]60 to 90 minutes, we're going to be here all day.
[14:12.98]This is gonna take a long fucking time.
[14:14.32]90 minutes for just a fucking pedal.
[14:30.07]This is a mistake.
[14:30.79]This is like, this is a 10 minute joke that I wanted to make and now it's a 9 hour stream.
[14:39.28]Do you have chest?
[14:40.06]I don't have any chest here.
[14:41.92]I guess unanimously people... Okay, so there's... There's like the before and after Labo streams, right?
[14:49.98]Before Labo and during Labo, it was okay.
[14:53.50]But like after Labo, it was like, don't ever do that again.
[14:58.15]So like now, now we're just... Now we're gonna put on like a high heel.
[15:03.21]I'm ready.
[15:05.39]Four steps you need to complete.
[15:07.73]Bass, pedal, frame, Joy-Con.
[15:09.29]I've had some practice.
[15:12.09]I'll be able to get this good.
[15:13.59]What do I need?
[15:15.09]And turn this fucking shitty music down, Nintendo.
[15:20.14]There.
[15:21.66]Perfect.
[15:22.62]What was this?
[15:26.06]This is the best kit.
[15:26.90]That's what I've been told by the guy that had the sun!
[15:28.54]The guy that had the sun!
[15:30.50]I told you.
[15:33.26]Okay, we need the big Yoshi face.
[15:37.05]The big spitter from Jurassic Park.
[15:39.07]That's what that is.
[15:40.33]That's the... Just that... Look at it.
[15:46.83]The spitter from Jurassic Park.
[15:50.84]I don't care when anybody says that's the image that's on the screen.
[15:53.12]I would have passed, like, the Rorschach test.
[15:58.37]Alright, where is it?
[15:59.17]A, petal A. And it's the Rorschach Yoshi face.
[16:05.41]This looks like the one right here.
[16:07.67]Now I also need to move some stuff because I can't trash this room.
[16:10.89]This is not a funny break stuff room.
[16:15.53]I just bought it.
[16:16.63]You think I'm gonna break it?
[16:18.83]I'm gonna move this sidewards, you know?
[16:23.52]Let's move this sidewards.
[16:27.42]Carry this, fine.
[16:28.54]I want this trash bag.
[16:30.78]You know, should I put the trash bag, like, in the table, like, underneath the legs, and then just drop it under the table?
[16:37.21]No, that's too much work.
[16:41.09]Alright, so I need to punch out, don't, remove these two pieces from sheet A. Don't forget the tiny piece in the bottom, so this little thing right here.
[16:48.63]So how does that look?
[16:49.81]Does this need to be adjusted?
[16:52.21]Let me adjust this camera, because it is, it's, lights are changing in here.
[17:01.40]Where'd it go?
[17:03.82]Oh.
[17:05.30]Shit.
[17:13.62]Fucking BenQ.
[17:14.22]Why do you have to have these fucking touchpad things?
[17:19.19]Just put buttons on like a regular fucking company.
[17:24.53]Okay.
[17:30.03]Where is it?
[17:36.60]Is there a reason why I can't configure this?
[17:39.70]What the fuck's going on here?
[17:44.34]Uh, yes, I'd like to configure that video, please.
[17:48.44]Why the fuck is going on here?
[17:51.15]Why can I not configure?
[17:57.13]Configure!
[18:02.43]I just did it!
[18:07.51]Do I seriously?
[18:08.25]Are you going to piss me off this much?
[18:09.83]I don't even have it on my taskbar or anything.
[18:13.25]I just can't even open the fucking Logitech software.
[18:19.68]What the fuck was that?
[18:20.74]What the hell was that?
[18:22.14]My camera just got struck by lightning.
[18:24.84]Configure.
[18:27.62]Thank you.
[18:28.46]Jesus.
[18:30.44]Who runs these companies?
[18:36.50]Alright, it looks good.
[18:39.48]And how's that?
[18:40.02]That's better, right?
[18:42.04]You can actually see what's going on here?
[18:51.47]Looks good.
[18:56.45]Okay.
[18:57.61]Let's go ahead and do it then.
[18:58.81]That's that camera.
[18:59.75]That's that one.
[19:02.05]Move this back so I can see it again.
[19:06.08]Alright, BenQ.
[19:10.39]I have an idea for a great company innovation.
[19:14.65]Instead of buttons, make really finicky touch buttons instead and waste electricity.
[19:25.53]There goes that sponsorship.
[19:31.55]Hey, okay, now I can see.
[19:32.89]Get it out of there.
[19:37.11]It's 60 to 90 minutes and it's already, we've already wasted 20.
[19:40.05]This, good.
[19:45.02]That piece here and then the little guy right there, a little dumbbell.
[19:50.76]Excellent.
[19:53.30]Make sure to put this in the, do it, don't be lazy about it, put it in the trash.
[19:57.72]Well, recycling, because this is going to go in the recycling.
[20:02.05]I don't need anything else from this, right?
[20:04.01]Here comes more, like, length.
[20:05.49]We have to, like, fold this shit and, like, pack it away neatly.
[20:11.31]Put it in the trash.
[20:11.97]No, this is going into the recycling.
[20:14.54]Come on, guys.
[20:15.76]Come on.
[20:16.18]Alright.
[20:17.68]We got the first piece out.
[20:32.23]You know, just get like the first few pieces.
[20:33.69]Alright, so we need this one from B. So that top one, B with the end here.
[20:42.97]So which one is it?
[20:45.65]B. Is this not the right thing?
[20:50.05]Looks like it is.
[20:52.29]Why does this look wrong?
[20:58.33]Oh, it's like a giant treasure map, okay.
[21:02.66]This one.
[21:03.06]Alright, that's good.
[21:10.02]Save that for now and let's start the assembling process, kids.
[21:16.97]Don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back button.
[21:18.89]I know how it works.
[21:19.61]So, let's get started on the pedal.
[21:22.11]First up is the big piece here.
[21:25.75]Make sure that you read Family Circus, because that's the mother from Family Circus, which no longer is even in print anymore, I don't think.
[21:32.99]I think it was discontinued back, like, two or three years ago.
[21:35.80]But, man, that was in the funnies.
[21:38.72]Alright, make sure you have plenty of space when working on big pieces.
[21:42.40]It might help to put away tiny pieces you don't need.
[21:44.80]I know how to work this.
[21:48.67]Thank God that comic sucked.
[21:56.52]Yeah, that comic, really?
[21:58.66]Seriously, like, I hate to continue the stall here, but we don't even need to stall.
[22:03.68]But seriously, that comic was just, you guys think Garfield was bad.
[22:07.62]Wasn't Family Circus like three panels and it was like, boy is out playing, mother calls boy in for dinner, boy comes in for dinner.
[22:17.57]That was it, there was no comedy.
[22:20.57]Alright, let's go.
[22:21.19]So we're gonna go this way.
[22:22.49]Nice and creased.
[22:24.95]All these folds have to happen.
[22:26.59]All of them.
[22:27.24]This is not my first time, man.
[22:33.74]I just, I can't.
[22:34.52]It's too far.
[22:35.10]I'm just gonna put it here for now.
[22:36.30]I'm gonna have to vacuum this room.
[22:41.54]Come in for dinner.
[22:42.18]Okay.
[22:44.04]And he comes in and he's like chocolate all over his mouth.
[22:46.66]Did you eat chocolate before coming in for dinner?
[22:48.60]Yeah.
[22:55.67]The kid looked like Bobby Hill.
[22:57.02]He looked like Shrunk.
[23:04.50]Family circus.
[23:12.18]Okay, dad.
[23:14.54]But that trope only happens when you're one or two years old, by the way.
[23:18.72]No four, five, six year old is getting like the giant mouth of chocolate all over their face.
[23:25.00]It doesn't happen.
[23:26.88]You ready for that satisfying satisfaction?
[23:28.68]It's been a while since we've heard that noise.
[23:36.96]How about the next one?
[23:47.77]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[23:48.99]I'm like embarrassed right now because I saw the screen.
[23:51.17]I'm turning red.
[23:52.19]I saw the webcam.
[23:55.80]You can't hear it?
[23:58.94]Wait for the fucking dickhead in the car.
[24:01.50]That guy is probably a nice, wonderful person.
[24:03.62]Who cares?
[24:12.16]So we got one, two, three.
[24:15.78]Same thing on the other side.
[24:23.19]Is he drunk?
[24:26.59]I've had the equivalent of drinking like a glass of Welch's grape juice, guys.
[24:31.08]That's not how it works.
[24:32.78]It's wine.
[24:33.52]That's not... Oh, you fucking... My walnut desk!
[24:44.22]Shit!
[24:55.30]Okay, that's alright for now.
[24:56.64]Fuck you.
[24:59.31]Alright.
[24:59.83]What we- Let's go.
[25:01.39]I got them all folded.
[25:02.39]Do we get these little, uh, knobs here?
[25:05.33]All the little ones too, or no?
[25:07.33]Yeah, gotta get all the small ones.
[25:10.23]And then... Bring in the big guy.
[25:12.81]Here we go.
[25:16.78]Wicked, uh... The turmoil is never the same after moving to Vegas.
[25:26.45]Uh, the Labo stream was like three or four months ago.
[25:30.83]The first one.
[25:31.57]So, I, I, this, it came with me.
[25:35.05]And, the best part is, I don't have to, like, destroy these.
[25:38.19]I can put these on, I'm gonna put them on a shelf.
[25:40.89]When I get, like, some of these, the, the pedal done.
[25:43.51]This, this, like, size 8 shoe is going up on a shelf up here.
[25:47.67]I don't have to get rid of it.
[25:48.63]I don't have to, like, recycle it.
[25:51.37]I recycle, yeah.
[25:52.05]I don't have a fucking problem with that.
[25:54.64]Alright, over here.
[25:56.78]These have to punch out.
[26:02.58]I'm just going to say fuck it in a vacuum later.
[26:04.60]That's just the way it is.
[26:09.74]Can we have a joke, please?
[26:11.60]Alright.
[26:17.84]You mean like a knock-knock type joke?
[26:20.22]What do you mean like a story?
[26:21.42]Look at how funny this story was.
[26:23.64]What?
[26:24.04]You didn't see that part coming in the middle?
[26:28.65]Which kind?
[26:34.43]Anything.
[26:34.91]Okay.
[26:35.81]How about Knock Knock?
[26:46.74]What's there?
[26:50.65]It's the police.
[26:57.87]Police who?
[26:59.63]Uh, open up.
[27:01.25]You are... You killed somebody.
[27:04.38]Now you're under arrest.
[27:07.40]We know the body's in the fridge.
[27:08.72]Alright, so wait, wait, wait.
[27:16.91]Let me get this right.
[27:21.12]Like that, right?
[27:21.81]Okay.
[27:22.63]And this part comes down.
[27:24.73]Snaps into place.
[27:26.27]And then this one folds... Okay, that's what this little one's for.
[27:29.15]Let's go... Oh, I'm sorry, little one.
[27:34.49]There we go.
[27:34.89]Connect from here to here.
[27:37.18]Right?
[27:39.86]And again, make sure it's snug.
[27:44.28]Oh!
[27:45.22]This is way better than... This is way better than the other two.
[27:47.66]This is way better!
[27:50.76]Sorry.
[27:52.14]This one folds, right?
[27:52.90]Where's that?
[27:53.30]Over here?
[27:59.25]This sticks into the... It's gonna go in that slot right there.
[28:01.67]Guarantee.
[28:02.19]I fucking guarantee it.
[28:03.29]Watch this.
[28:07.28]In she goes.
[28:08.52]Right in here.
[28:10.00]Sunny side up.
[28:13.94]Can you guys see?
[28:14.48]I'm gonna make sure the class... You guys are following along, right?
[28:19.61]See, the thing is, one of you guys got this for your birthday, like, a month ago, and you were like, holy shit, I'm never gonna use that.
[28:24.43]But you're like, oh, thanks, Grandma.
[28:26.73]It's been rotting in your closet for, like, two or three months.
[28:30.72]But then you saw this stream turned on, and you fucking sprinted as fast as you could to go to the closet and grab it and, like, do it with me.
[28:38.70]Three of you did that.
[28:39.42]Okay, beautifully.
[28:39.98]Now let's put these connected pieces to one side for a moment.
[28:43.58]Why would I need to take a break?
[28:46.86]Take a break?
[28:48.71]Alright, well there it is.
[28:49.31]I put two things together.
[28:52.65]What is Nintendo's obsession with breaks?
[28:55.89]Look, if I want to drink a box of wine and play with a children's toy, I'm gonna do that, okay?
[29:02.92]Don't worry about me.
[29:03.76]I'm gonna be just fine.
[29:06.81]It's like Wii Sports all over again.
[29:08.29]Are you sure there's enough room?
[29:10.03]No, I'm not sure.
[29:10.63]I'm going to ruin my house.
[29:12.26]I'm going to start smashing stuff.
[29:13.56]I'm going to break the vases and I'm going to break a couple windows.
[29:15.96]I wasn't sure.
[29:16.50]Thanks for reminding me.
[29:19.10]Okay, so we did these from C. Did they do that because they think someone's going to sue them?
[29:26.32]You got to say, hey, make sure you don't break any windows in your house with the Wii mode.
[29:30.84]Would somebody actually do that?
[29:34.55]Can you imagine if you like threw your Wiimote into your TV and you were like Nintendo did that!
[29:43.26]What the fuck Nintendo, why'd you do that?
[29:49.14]You gonna waste the energy to call and like get a lawyer?
[29:51.73]You gonna get a lawyer?
[29:52.69]Imagine explaining that to the lawyer
[29:56.53]Hello, yes, this is, uh, B.D.
[29:58.62]Richards and Sons.
[29:59.50]How can I help you?
[30:00.18]Hey, I whipped a fucking heavy object into my TV.
[30:04.28]And it broke it.
[30:05.10]And the company that sold me the thing, I want to sue them.
[30:16.49]Hello?
[30:20.99]I've got these two.
[30:30.54]Alright, is that all we need?
[30:32.40]Just these 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[30:33.84]1, 2, 3, 4.
[30:35.62]Sorry, I miscounted.
[30:38.46]That's it, right?
[30:40.27]Thing is, I don't want to get rid of these just yet, because I'm going to need to track them down later.
[30:43.23]I'm having so much fun.
[30:45.45]God, I miss this.
[30:47.21]You will need the rest of the pieces and see later.
[30:48.95]Is the music too loud?
[30:50.25]I'm turning it down.
[30:55.32]Sort of like a pair of spoons, aren't they?
[30:57.74]I mean...
[31:01.09]No?
[31:03.69]A spoon?
[31:04.75]These are spoons?
[31:10.11]Sort of like a pair of spoons, okay.
[31:16.52]Flip them over so they're on the back so you got them facing the right way.
[31:19.72]I don't know, you just did it with spoons.
[31:22.18]How can I trust you ever again?
[31:33.50]Okay, so now they're facing the right way.
[31:35.54]Fold them up.
[31:35.92]Wait, I've got to take care of this.
[31:42.04]I love the people that are trickling into the stream right now.
[31:45.41]I just looked over at the chat and I saw not this again.
[31:58.63]Oh, yeah.
[32:00.56]Make sure you, hey, make sure you grab yourself a box wine.
[32:03.76]If you're at least the age of drinking in your particular region or time zone.
[32:08.91]Drinking is by time zone.
[32:10.45]Pacific time is allowed to start drinking at 5, 4, 5 p.m.
[32:16.57]Eastern time is not allowed to start drinking until like 5 p.m.
[32:19.07]Eastern, which is, you know, it's by time zone.
[32:23.69]It's 3.30 in the afternoon is Pacific.
[32:36.13]Oh yeah, it is.
[32:42.81]Yeah, I... Tons of information is racing through my brain right now.
[32:49.92]Literally everything I've ever done is racing through my mind.
[32:54.02]I just had a vision of me doing this and being like, holy shit, what a weirdo.
[33:06.29]I'm having a crisis right now.
[33:08.41]It's happening.
[33:09.87]I'm too self-aware.
[33:13.15]I need to install the 2013 Jerma emulator and run it in a virtual machine in my brain.
[33:18.67]Because I'm like... What the fuck is happening right now?
[33:29.94]Old age.
[33:30.42]Alright.
[33:30.98]Wait.
[33:31.16]Fold.
[33:34.26]Fold this.
[33:37.68]I'm not breaking it was it a break it's designed to be folded half a glass of wine and already drunk listen buddy that ain't how it works
[33:57.85]Back in my heyday, I could drink this whole box and puke and be sick and it was awful and it was never fun.
[34:05.65]It sucked every time.
[34:06.71]Don't fucking do it.
[34:07.85]It's not cool to drink too much to the point where you fucking black out and get sick.
[34:12.02]Don't, it's not fucking fun.
[34:13.40]Don't do it.
[34:21.88]I need to, this could take like all day.
[34:26.00]I had this vision in my brain that this was not gonna take this long.
[34:29.43]Where's that piece?
[34:32.13]These have to fold up?
[34:38.13]Like that, okay.
[34:39.25]Same thing with the other one.
[34:42.23]This is hard to do.
[34:42.93]Stream is seeing things.
[34:50.52]No, just don't, just be, just know your limits.
[34:53.88]If your limit is a box of wine, know it, know what it is.
[35:04.77]Violent boomer destroys Nintendo Labo.
[35:08.03]Ah, I don't see anything destroyed at the moment.
[35:10.15]I see a lot of well-crafted, nice, very taking my time boomer playing with the Nintendo Labo.
[35:23.63]So then these go through here.
[35:24.85]This is going to turn into a little grill.
[35:30.28]These fold.
[35:30.90]Fold both of them.
[35:38.91]When is elf bowling?
[35:39.73]You're going to have to get the emulator for that one.
[35:51.26]Dremel is gonna destroy this one like the piano.
[35:53.54]No, I destroyed the piano because I didn't like the piano, okay?
[36:01.25]I like this one.
[36:05.86]Time to start putting everything together.
[36:06.80]Stand up with the blade like this.
[36:10.34]What if you don't like that?
[36:11.00]I'm gonna like this one.
[36:12.14]I already read the reviews.
[36:15.30]Will you let me pay attention?
[36:17.06]So this one has to go... I like... This is cool.
[36:20.44]So this one sticks in there like this.
[36:24.67]Like that.
[36:25.85]That feels actually really nice.
[36:28.83]What a piece of shit.
[36:33.63]What?
[36:34.45]Alright.
[36:35.95]Looks good.
[36:37.83]Flip it around.
[36:40.79]It is all the... It is satisfying.
[36:42.01]It is.
[36:45.37]Flip the whole thing over, and we've got something that looks like the twin, and it goes in here, like this, right?
[36:51.96]Like that.
[36:53.84]Did somebody, no.
[36:55.02]Somebody gave money, though.
[36:55.82]$10 just came in.
[36:59.61]From Shpee.
[37:02.01]Shpee Shoal.
[37:03.97]Thank you for the 10 bucks, man.
[37:09.21]That's cool.
[37:10.52]I need some more light.
[37:27.52]Don't you just see my information?
[37:39.79]That's too much!
[37:43.75]And you will RISE with the sun!
[37:53.02]No, that's- you can't see anything!
[37:56.52]I just needed to point this way for a second.
[37:59.30]That looks okay.
[38:04.57]That was not what I wanted to do.
[38:07.57]Like there?
[38:08.99]What is this for?
[38:10.17]What is this for?
[38:12.65]What is this for?
[38:13.61]I don't know what this is for.
[38:26.18]What do you do with this thing?
[38:27.20]It just sits there and looks nice for a second.
[38:39.28]The box mine is in the way.
[38:40.27]That's the problem.
[38:47.19]I'm like at a campfire.
[38:49.41]Forget it.
[38:50.25]It's fine.
[38:51.29]Let's crack this open a little bit.
[38:52.71]Just give me a second.
[38:54.02]It's too dark right here.
[39:16.51]Okay, that's better.
[39:19.59]Incoming joke.
[39:21.15]Nope.
[39:22.93]Incoming more light so you can see.
[39:25.65]But I need to turn that off.
[39:26.61]I don't know what... Phillips, I need to ask somebody at Phillips a question.
[39:31.04]You've got a great product here.
[39:33.40]Why am I so concerned about this?
[39:34.90]Like, don't look at my password.
[39:36.34]Okay, let me go in here.
[39:45.42]Like, what are you hiding?
[39:53.79]Okay, that's better.
[39:55.15]Alright, back to it.
[39:57.87]Where's this going to go?
[39:58.45]Right here.
[39:58.73]That's fine.
[40:01.09]Needed more light.
[40:02.29]Alright.
[40:03.32]Those are both on.
[40:07.04]Let's check everything's properly in place.
[40:08.20]Are your pieces neatly lined up like this?
[40:09.90]Yes, they are.
[40:11.34]Now we need from sheet B, wherever the hell that is.
[40:17.32]This is sheet B. Show your taxes.
[40:26.98]I don't think I don't think so so we need the little m's so we need one two three build me a waifu well this is a pedal um I don't I don't think that's what you're asking for I'm sorry uh
[40:57.40]Let's go.
[40:59.64]It's a family of triplets labeled 1, 2, 3, and they're eager to join our slot party.
[41:06.18]Good thing we've got some more slots along the big pieces.
[41:08.16]Okay, so I'm assuming it's going to go 1, 2, 3.
[41:10.20]I know how to do this.
[41:11.64]It's going to go bang, bang, bang.
[41:14.70]Look at that.
[41:16.12]Beautiful.
[41:17.31]So, bang.
[41:18.37]1.
[41:21.65]2. 3.
[41:30.34]Bang, yeah.

[41:50.49]Look at that.
[41:52.87]Okay.
[41:55.75]Gift subs, oh shit.
[41:58.48]Pocket Pondling has gifted five community subs.
[42:02.38]Cheers to that, man.
[42:03.12]Thank you.
[42:04.08]Thanks to the five gifted community subs.
[42:08.96]You're the man.
[42:10.38]Congratulations to those five lucky contestants.
[42:16.98]Finally bring back the pieces we started off with.
[42:20.82]This thing.
[42:21.90]Get that over here.
[42:23.44]And this is gonna be the guts.
[42:25.66]This is gonna be the real guts.
[42:33.79]Hold on, this is poppin' out.
[42:38.50]Oh, fuck.
[42:39.30]Somebody, okay, Matters of Darkness, thanks for the five community subs.

[42:49.16]Big subs comin' in.
[42:53.73]Thank you guys a lot.
[42:55.61]More GIFs.
[42:58.03]You can't, come on, they're GIFs.
[43:00.63]Alright, so lay them out flat and place our slotty structure on top.
[43:04.32]It's a little tab, should fit right into the middle holes.
[43:06.72]What the hell are you talking about?
[43:14.63]Right here, okay.
[43:17.69]That sticks just in.
[43:20.03]Does it though?
[43:20.53]This tab is poking out.
[43:35.54]Those are in, as in as they can be.
[43:38.16]Okay.
[43:43.49]Looks just like the, on the box, on the picture.
[43:47.75]Now fold it all up.
[43:49.11]This is the part that I love.
[43:51.15]This is why you're all watching, to see this right here.
[43:53.97]This, the skeleton closing in over the muscles.
[43:57.35]The bone marrow, I mean.
[43:58.61]Here you go, you ready?
[44:22.32]How many people would have just left if I did that, do you think?
[44:27.14]That was very satisfying.
[44:28.28]Okay, so then there's the bass pedal.
[44:30.69]It's beginning to look like a proper bass.
[44:33.35]Now grab this piece, the little hang glider from B. This one.
[44:54.84]Okay.
[44:55.40]There it is.
[44:55.70]You can see the Labo writing on it.
[44:59.72]So that one, let's punch that out.
[45:01.33]Okay.
[45:02.29]Okay.
[45:06.69]That was inherently satisfying.
[45:08.07]It was.
[45:09.15]Here's a pro tip.
[45:10.05]Skip.
[45:13.27]All of it's going to fold.
[45:14.03]Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.
[45:15.63]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[45:17.56]And then it's going to go in.
[45:19.40]But how does it go in?
[45:23.97]This is the part where he fucks it up.
[45:27.27]No, I got to get the camera in a good spot after this because this is a, we're making a car.
[45:35.68]You better believe I'm going to bring this to the green screen stream as a wheel and like a pedal.
[45:44.65]I'm going to bring, I'm going to have a wheel in my hands.
[45:47.13]Okay.
[45:48.55]So that's that.
[45:51.31]This is a bird?
[45:52.39]This is gonna be a petal.
[45:57.89]At the moment.
[46:00.04]Alright, where does it go?
[46:02.94]So this part turns this way, so you can see inside, and then flip the whole cover piece and we're ready to get constructing.
[46:12.27]Like that.
[46:14.35]And then that goes... first is up with the two tabs at the top, slide them both in at once.
[46:20.20]Like that.
[46:21.24]Okay, let me get this folded.
[46:25.76]What about back here though?
[46:27.85]They all fold up, okay.
[46:39.35]This is the part where he fucks it up.
[46:42.97]Not quite.
[46:44.19]Not yet at least.
[46:45.29]Okay, then the bottom tab goes in.
[46:47.91]Slide it, snap.
[46:50.10]And then side to side.
[46:54.62]Easy enough, okay.
[46:59.74]Wait for the crunch, wait for the crunch!
[47:03.85]Ooh, that was a little too much of a crunch.
[47:13.07]Alright.
[47:15.13]Done.
[47:17.56]Ruined?
[47:17.86]I didn't ruin it.
[47:18.30]What are you talking about?
[47:19.28]It's perfect.
[47:20.68]Lo and behold, we've completed the base of the pedal.
[47:24.68]Alright.
[47:25.80]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[47:26.66]That's going to be the end of the Labo segment of the stream.
[47:29.45]Now we're going to go on to part two.
[47:37.73]Oh, make sure you got your dongle bag.
[47:39.19]I got to get the dongle bag up here.
[47:41.89]So wait, what do I need?
[47:42.53]What pieces?
[47:46.83]Part 2 of 183.
[47:47.41]Okay.
[47:49.16]Making the actual pedal.
[47:50.18]Make sure you've got the special dongle part bag.
[47:53.00]You don't have to open it yet, so just know where it is.
[47:54.84]Okay, that's fine.
[47:55.38]I know where it is.
[47:57.12]Remove this one piece.
[47:58.04]This is the big one.
[48:01.30]Almost there.
[48:08.47]By the way, this is a game in itself.
[48:09.77]If I spill wine on, uh, on the ground here, I lost, um, I lost a lot of money.
[48:16.58]So, like, just keep, that's a, that's a game, essentially.
[48:25.16]What the fuck?
[48:30.88]Uh, pocket, pocket piling just gave ten community subs.
[48:37.27]pocketpolling coming in with 10 holy shit that's uh that's a lot of money well congratulations to the 10 people that got um this massive amount of community subs given away by pocketpolling and others of matters of darkness as well that's uh that's a lot thank you dude
[49:03.69]So what is the... Is there any criteria to get the random sub?
[49:09.05]Or is it just... You just get it randomly.
[49:12.47]Someone in the chat does.
[49:14.21]It just happens.
[49:18.14]Damn.
[49:20.16]You just can't be subbed.
[49:21.48]Okay.
[49:24.06]That's pretty cool.
[49:25.00]I didn't really know how it worked.
[49:29.28]You probably have to be following.
[49:30.74]I mean, I don't have any settings set up like that if they exist.
[49:34.56]Whatever they are, they're default.
[49:36.70]But, thank you, dude.
[49:38.47]Thanks so much for your massive amount of subs that you've just gifted.
[49:44.15]So, we got this piece.
[49:49.17]I'm gonna give 10 more.
[49:50.41]Hold on.
[49:51.17]What are you doing?
[49:55.25]Oh my god.
[49:58.15]There's another 10.
[49:59.24]There it is.
[50:02.30]10, that's 20 community subs from pocket falling.
[50:07.72]Holy shit.
[50:10.08]I'm gonna put this out of the way for now because we've got another piece here that we need to work with, but damn pocket falling.
[50:17.72]At the end of the day, thank you man.
[50:20.01]Like that's, that's a lot.
[50:24.67]Is it 26 now?
[50:29.08]Well, congratulations to the lucky double dozen here.
[50:40.93]Oh, he bought the actual Labo this time.
[50:42.65]I had the other Labos before.
[50:46.80]I just did the pizza thing, and it worked.
[50:49.28]Are we good?
[50:52.90]Oh, there's a couple more little tabs.
[50:55.99]You know what?
[50:56.91]I have one complaint about the lab ball.
[50:59.95]Can you pre-tab it?
[51:01.51]Can you pre-punch the tabs?
[51:03.11]I mean, I know it's cheeky and oh no, but it's fun to punch out the little tabs.
[51:08.27]It just makes a mess.
[51:09.79]I already got enough recycling.
[51:10.89]Now I gotta find all these little bits and pieces.
[51:17.07]Oh my lord.
[51:17.77]Uh...

[54:21.29]Kairotope, 20.
[54:25.59]Thank you so much, everybody.
[54:28.87]Such concludes the gifted sub portion.
[54:39.52]It blows my mind all the time, guys.
[54:41.50]Like, seriously.
[54:52.35]That's five from Jamie.
[54:54.47]Jamie2803.
[54:56.75]Throwing the hat into the party here.
[55:00.98]Five more from Jamie.
[55:05.86]Speech, speech.
[55:08.14]I don't have a speech.
[55:11.19]I just hope that the next year that you watch, you think is worth the money.
[55:17.44]I hope the next month, the next 30 days you watch, you think is worth it.
[55:20.28]Because obviously it's every 30 days.
[55:22.90]And if you don't think it's fun anymore after 30 days, then you should not pay me money.
[55:30.31]You know what I mean?
[55:35.91]I just can't believe that people... That's 10 from Visual Warlock.
[55:42.62]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[55:50.15]Thank you so much, dude.
[55:51.79]Thank you, all of you.
[55:58.41]10 fucking subs, 5 subs, 20 subs, 10 subs, 10 subs.
[56:00.51]That's a lot of money.
[56:01.40]I think sometimes it gets, like, lost.
[56:05.44]You know what I mean?
[56:07.08]Like, just how much money that is to give to somebody.
[56:10.02]Ramshackle giving out 5 here.
[56:15.46]Thank you so much, dude.
[56:16.50]Thank you, Ramshackle, for your 5 community subs.
[56:23.77]Thank you, everybody.
[56:25.43]Like, I'm essentially speechless at the moment, because every time something like this happens... I... It's like, uh... It's a weird feeling.
[56:37.82]Another 5 from... Vertib... From Vertebral Giant.
[56:45.68]We're getting... This is definitely over 100.
[56:50.57]Am I doing this right?
[56:51.47]Am I doing the level correct?
[56:56.14]I just saw somebody was angry because of this.
[56:59.63]I'm sorry.
[57:00.29]I don't want you to be angry.
[57:04.43]I want you to have fun.
[57:08.03]You guys are fucking... This is like ridiculous.
[57:15.95]Oh, the gifted subs are stalling.
[57:18.01]Oh no.
[57:24.71]Oh my god.
[57:35.05]Pocket Pauling, just give $100 right now.
[57:38.93]$100.
[57:38.95]$100.
[57:38.97]You'll see it in a second.
[57:40.03]There's so many subs coming through Streamlabs that it can't even keep up, I don't think.
[57:45.86]Holy shit.
[57:49.42]Well, Pocket Pauling, you've dumped at least two to plus $300 right now.
[57:56.92]Thank you for the $100 here.
[57:57.82]Hey, Jeremy, it was my birthday yesterday and I got cash.
[58:01.46]So I thought I would be cash money of me to gift subs with the money I got.
[58:06.38]Thank you for being a positive force and also thank you for drinking box wine on stream.
[58:09.44]It's validation and I support you.
[58:15.76]Cheers, man.
[58:18.39]Happy birthday.
[58:20.47]I hope you had a good one.
[58:24.62]I'm shocked and honored and every kind of emotion that you would want to give me, your birthday money, dude.
[58:33.12]Thank you.
[58:34.81]I hope you had a good time.
[58:35.75]I hope you were taken care of and I hope you took care of yourself.
[58:42.79]Much love to you.
[58:45.59]that's a lot of fucking money.
[58:48.21]And don't ever forget that, because like I was about to say, it gets lost sometimes.
[58:55.12]Like, oh, like, ten bucks, twenty bucks, like, two dollars, one dollar, one dollar, twenty bucks, hundred bucks, hundred bucks, hundred bucks.
[59:01.00]It gets lost in like a river.
[59:04.98]In a lot of cases, and I really don't want that to ever be the case.
[59:08.45]So, I hope you never feel that that's the case.
[59:12.89]But it
[59:17.06]You throw your money in a river?
[59:19.24]No, I hope you know what I mean by that.
[59:23.23]But happy fucking birthday to you, Pocket Pauling.
[59:27.29]I hope it was a great one.
[59:31.77]Uh, but anyways.
[59:34.63]Uh, thank you for... Thank you for just, like, giving me a guy on the internet, like, right now, like, four or five hundred dollars, probably, right there, whatever that was.
[59:47.32]I will put it to good use, I promise.
[59:50.62]I promise.
[59:52.12]So, where were we here?
[60:02.65]We'll go into more box wine.
[60:04.45]That's correct.
[60:06.30]So we got all these pieces, all these things.
[60:11.20]Everything needs to be folded.
[60:12.28]I got those.
[60:12.82]I got this.
[60:13.30]I got this one.
[60:15.24]So then where does this go in the grand scheme of things here?
[60:18.30]Did I get that?
[60:18.92]I did.
[60:20.12]Hey!
[60:21.41]Removed the five pieces from sheet B. So sheet B only has one more piece after this.
[60:25.91]And it's the weird toaster looking thing in the bottom right.
[60:31.08]Celebratory dab?
[60:35.44]Fine.
[60:38.88]I had an itchy nose for a second.
[60:59.32]The madman.
[61:00.87]He's gone crazy.
[61:05.34]Wow, you stopped drinking.
[61:06.42]What a lightweight.
[61:07.34]I just filled it like not even 10, not even five minutes ago.
[61:10.66]Do you know how many glasses of wine are in this fucking box of wine?
[61:15.86]29.
[61:17.72]No, no, no, no.
[61:19.36]That's 29 wine enthusiasts say this is their best buy award.
[61:24.78]There's three liters in here.
[61:26.06]Nintendo Davo.
[61:34.30]Jesus.
[61:36.10]Alright, got these five pieces.
[61:37.54]Flip it over, of course.
[61:40.58]Rip all these little knobs out.
[61:46.35]Three compact liters.
[61:48.21]Three liters.
[61:50.97]Jeremiah has a strong neck.
[61:55.51]I don't, my neck always hurts.
[61:57.51]Is that what that means?
[62:06.19]Three liters is two glasses.
[62:07.65]Three liters is like 20 glasses of wine, like at least 15.
[62:11.12]So then this folds in half.
[62:14.70]And then all these stick in the middle here, OK?
[62:16.94]So pocket falling just gave another $50.
[62:33.80]Thank you for the $50 on top of all the other huge amount of money that you've given today, Pocket Pauling.
[62:39.34]$50.
[62:39.58]Thanks for the birthday wishes, everyone.
[62:40.78]Also, Jerma, please don't make yourself sick.
[62:42.42]I'm drinking box wine right now, but that doesn't mean you should.
[62:45.84]Sorry for giving more money.
[62:51.29]Don't apologize.
[62:53.41]I appreciate it.
[62:54.01]I really do.
[62:54.41]I hope you know that.
[62:58.38]He's drunk.
[62:59.68]He's drunk and donating.
[63:01.38]Two things you never want to do.
[63:03.05]Drunk and donate.
[63:06.43]Oh my god.
[63:07.11]People are giving money now saying sorry.
[63:12.87]Somebody stop him.
[63:15.13]No.
[63:19.41]That's... Okay.
[63:24.06]We're drinking box wine together.
[63:26.38]It's a box wine kind of day.
[63:27.96]It's always a, this is like, guys, this is so cheap too.
[63:30.87]You don't have to go buy the most expensive bullshit.
[63:33.15]People go, but here, cheap doesn't mean bad.
[63:35.67]You could go buy Fireball and that's bad, right?
[63:40.20]We all agree on that.
[63:41.30]But like a box of wine, it's like, this is like $17 for like six days worth of alcohol.
[63:47.12]Alright, what do I do with these?
[63:54.79]This tastes good.
[63:56.25]This is good.
[63:58.50]I'll give it a stamp.
[63:59.60]Black Box Premium Wines, the red blend.
[64:03.40]It's good.
[64:05.05]If they're watching right now, why would they be... This is not a video game.
[64:09.11]This is not like a game.
[64:10.31]Oh, if the dev is watching right now, why am I that much of a fucking egomaniac?
[64:15.18]Like, oh yeah, you know, Black Box is probably watching right now.
[64:18.62]What?
[64:18.86]There's like 2,900... There's like 50 trillion people on Earth.
[64:21.92]You think like the Black Box fucking wine smeller is watching this right now?
[64:28.53]But yeah, red blends are always the best.
[64:30.01]Always buy a red blend.
[64:30.93]If you don't like red, you'll probably like a red blend.
[64:37.36]What?
[64:38.26]Wait, what?
[64:39.72]This is just a money stream.
[64:44.25]Okay.
[64:47.25]First of all, Boston Gam gave $55.50.
[64:51.01]$55, they just say sorry.
[65:01.91]Don't say sorry.
[65:02.63]Thank you, Boston Game, for the huge amount of fucking money.
[65:05.55]And then RT.
[65:07.37]RT Game Crowd came in with $100.
[65:14.87]Thank you, RT Game Crowd. $100.
[65:19.34]Just to make sure you don't recover emotionally.
[65:22.52]But for real, thanks for the years of content, man.
[65:24.58]You're my all-time favorite creator and a massive influence on my own content.
[65:28.46]Been wanting to drop 100 on you for ages.
[65:30.97]Go get yourself some more wine and cardboard.
[65:39.39]Thank you, RT.
[65:41.13]That's insane to hear that.
[65:46.65]You're doing a great fucking job, dude.
[65:49.20]Like, you really are.
[65:51.76]Those of you that don't know who RT is, he's fucking killing it.
[65:54.92]You're doing great, man.
[65:56.94]I'm more than happy for you.
[65:57.96]For real.
[66:01.34]Uh, but... Is Jerma okay?
[66:05.41]I'm fine.
[66:05.99]I'm like, I'm very happy right now.
[66:08.47]How do you... How can I be not happy right now?
[66:13.87]But, thank you so much.
[66:16.93]Um...
[66:18.72]That's amazing to hear.
[66:22.58]I just got like $700 in 25 minutes.
[66:27.27]I'm kind of like, I don't really know what to do.
[66:31.83]I hope you guys... Look, I say it a lot, but this here...
[66:40.11]This.
[66:41.75]No, this is number one.
[66:45.79]Nothing else takes place of number one.
[66:47.87]Except for my dog.
[66:50.31]And, like, I don't know, like, my mother.
[66:54.15]And, like, I don't know, maybe, like, my girlfriend's up there, like, number one.
[67:02.74]My health.
[67:03.68]So, maybe not number one.
[67:05.00]You're probably, like, number, like, four.
[67:07.11]But you're like in the top five, right?
[67:09.17]Under mom.
[67:09.67]You guys are under mom, right?
[67:11.07]That's a pretty big deal.
[67:16.30]We're number four.
[67:20.72]In the top five.
[67:24.89]But all jokes aside, the only thing I care about with this stream is making sure that people have fun.
[67:31.03]And if you don't, then I hope you tell me.
[67:33.80]Like, right now.
[67:34.44]Like, I'm sure people are like, there's probably at least a thousand people here that are going like, you gonna build the fucking thing, dude?
[67:41.43]And I'm like, yeah, yeah, just wait, I'm going, I'm trying.
[67:44.59]But, uh, for real.
[67:47.81]You guys mean a lot to me.
[67:49.19]The stream does.
[67:50.87]The whole thing does.
[67:52.01]So, I've never thought differently and I never will.
[67:55.13]So, okay.
[67:59.74]Much love to you.
[68:00.16]Are you gonna build that fucking thing, stupid?
[68:04.88]It's hard.
[68:05.56]It's cardboard for kids.
[68:07.87]Boston game gave another $50.
[68:12.39]Sorry about the sorry, but in all seriousness, I've enjoyed your content for years, and this is the least I can do to repay all the joy and entertainment you've given me.
[68:21.13]I mean, what about my repayment to you?
[68:24.74]Look at where I am right now.
[68:28.72]I moved to Las Vegas, and I'm working with a studio, and I'm going to be doing a bunch of shit on...
[68:35.86]Who made that happen?
[68:37.26]You know what I mean?
[68:38.26]Sure, I run the stream and I make the stuff, but if there weren't people here supporting the stream and giving the fucking money, and if there weren't people here, then I wouldn't be able to do it.
[68:49.19]Don't forget that.
[68:50.78]It's important.
[68:54.02]But...
[68:57.52]I've been on the same step for 40 minutes.
[68:59.50]Well, but there were like some extenuating circumstances.
[69:02.32]Like a thousand dollars came in.
[69:04.56]And I'm going to give it the attention that I believe it deserves.
[69:06.70]So I'm sorry.
[69:16.89]There's so many subscribers.
[69:18.43]That subscription noise is going to happen for like the next 20 or 30 straight minutes.
[69:26.97]I created this.
[69:28.05]I made this.
[69:28.93]Oh my goodness.
[69:30.61]That's... That's from... That's how many notifications... Think about the notifications.
[69:36.17]That's from probably like 20 minutes ago.
[69:42.77]And five more subs from bet three.
[69:48.84]Cheers, everybody.
[69:49.40]For real.
[69:55.93]Smoke if you got them.
[69:57.57]If you don't, what's that smoke?
[69:58.33]Smoke is bad for you.
[69:59.41]Alright.
[70:00.47]So these all need to go.
[70:01.49]Am I doing this the right way?
[70:06.17]I think I am, right?
[70:07.17]Because, right?
[70:08.13]That's the correct way, right?
[70:11.23]The piece is the wrong way.
[70:15.87]That's not...
[70:31.29]No, you match it up with the... Like... Okay, no, that is... Okay, they were right.
[70:43.26]You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[70:45.78]And when you're right, you're right.
[70:52.15]You just are.
[70:56.53]Why is he taking an hour to do this?
[70:59.47]If you just jumped in, or if you were here like an hour ago... Okay, so that's... I gotta explain.
[71:03.63]For the people that... I should have just been staring at this like... I don't understand how this... How does this work?
[71:13.80]Like... Well, I started this and then there was a lot of money came in.
[71:18.58]So I had to stop for like a while.
[71:21.57]I'm sorry.
[71:23.29]I'm sorry!
[71:23.93]Okay, check your work.
[71:25.47]Work looks good.
[71:30.04]Everything from the side looks alright.
[71:31.96]You tell me.
[71:32.50]That was bad.
[71:36.42]That was a bad view.
[71:38.34]Time to join up to the big fat guy.
[71:40.68]Fold up this edge.
[71:41.95]Are we the right way?
[71:43.03]No, we're not the right way.
[71:45.09]So that goes up.
[71:46.51]This goes through.
[71:50.03]Streamer sucks.
[71:53.97]Don't be so mean to me.
[71:55.27]Alright, so then this part...
[72:02.73]I changed my mind.
[72:03.49]Can I please have my $700 donation back, please?
[72:09.00]All sales are final.
[72:11.44]Whoa.
[72:13.40]Whoa.
[72:14.54]Hold on a second here.
[72:25.59]There's RT's money.
[72:31.86]Big money is getting to him.
[72:33.98]No, I don't even want that to happen.
[72:37.28]I need to continuously ground myself.
[72:41.31]I can't, I won't.
[72:42.97]Okay, there we go.
[72:46.39]So that's not sitting still though.
[72:50.37]Is it?
[72:53.46]Why is this not flat?
[72:56.60]This is not flat, mine's not flat, why?
[73:05.68]That's Vegas gambling stream money.
[73:09.57]This is freaking me out, man.
[73:10.61]This is like popsicle stand looking shit here.
[73:12.35]Okay, this goes up.
[73:13.11]I want you guys to be able to see.
[73:17.35]So that goes up like this.
[73:21.93]Like that.
[73:26.20]And then it folds all the way.
[73:27.62]I never did this one.
[73:33.88]Shaw, fuck, I never did this one.
[73:39.35]There it is.
[73:39.81]Okay, hold on.
[73:40.43]Let me make sure that's tight.
[73:41.99]So I got the little flaps here.
[73:45.33]Can you get a casino stream?
[73:46.49]I would probably do something like that for fun, but you cannot film in a casino in Vegas.
[73:50.72]You will get slapped in the face.
[73:53.92]If I was just sitting there like, oh, hey guys, should I hit on, I got blackjack.
[73:57.65]It would be like, it would be bad.
[74:04.52]Hold the side you rolled up with one hand.
[74:06.00]Like that.
[74:07.32]Like an ice cream sandwich.
[74:08.28]Flip this one up.
[74:12.80]Use a hidden camera.
[74:17.49]I'm not going to jail for a stream.
[74:27.98]Alright, well I need to pay attention.
[74:29.28]This comes up.
[74:33.14]Do it for views.
[74:36.84]Look at that.
[74:37.30]This is going to sound so nice.
[74:45.64]That goes in there, right?
[74:46.58]Come on, tell me it does.
[74:47.55]I know it does.
[74:48.19]I've seen this movie.
[74:51.83]For content?
[74:55.39]That's not... A hidden camera in a casino is not... How is that like content?
[75:03.96]Just go watch cops, you'll see the same material.
[75:09.82]From the side, all the tabs come up.
[75:11.56]I don't think I folded these yet.
[75:17.46]Build a Labo in the casino.
[75:20.87]I'll tell you what I was actually going to do, what I thought would be funny.
[75:24.79]I'm sorry that I'm going to spoil this because it was a really, really good idea.
[75:27.79]I was going to... There are a lot of mountains around here.
[75:32.01]There's like two that way, there's like three that way.
[75:35.77]Vegas is surrounded by mountains.
[75:38.29]And I thought it would be funny... This is not even a spoiler, don't worry.
[75:40.21]I thought it would be funny if I built the Labo on the top of the summit of one of the mountains.
[75:46.97]Like...
[75:50.29]Like, oh, we're doing a Labo today.
[75:51.65]Labo.
[75:52.05]And then it's just me, like, wind gusting and trying to build a Labo on the summit of a mountain.
[75:58.43]Like, Las Vegas just has so many mountains.
[76:02.45]Everywhere.
[76:03.61]So, in every direction.
[76:08.58]Do it.
[76:09.26]There wasn't enough time.
[76:11.46]I'd have to, like, that's a huge project.
[76:14.22]Way more than I think anybody realizes.
[76:17.48]I don't think I would even be able to have internet up there.
[76:19.50]That was a huge problem with the hot air balloon stuff, too, is you just don't fucking have internet.
[76:25.58]Like, it's just not possible to, like, get it actually, like, the way that I really, really, really would want it to happen.
[76:36.80]Try to climb every so you can build a labo.
[76:41.37]So these come in.
[76:44.65]Oh!
[76:45.88]Oh no, okay.
[76:47.36]Is that supposed to happen?
[76:49.50]It is.
[76:52.94]Just use a really long cable.
[76:56.13]This is why people give you money.
[76:59.55]Well, it's kind of, it's a cycle that, you know, I use the money.
[77:06.13]So if somebody, like for instance, this money right here.
[77:08.38]This is probably gonna go directly, the way that I get paid from Twitch.
[77:14.60]is like every month I I want to like you know do something that something different or that it costs money or that's where the money goes if you're curious as to where like oh where do I where does my sub money go where does my like bit money go I mean I'm going in front of a green screen in like five days and I have a shitload of props and we're doing like a whole green screen community event that's kind of like that's kind of where it goes
[77:42.39]Every, like, 30 to 45 days, I try to think of something to do, you know?
[77:46.86]And why can I not do this?
[77:55.12]Am I doing this wrong?
[78:01.13]This comes up.
[78:01.99]Okay.
[78:02.45]I was like, what the fuck am I doing wrong?
[78:10.91]There we go.
[78:18.46]But yeah, look, I'll be completely and totally see-through about this, and I'll be transparent about it.
[78:24.31]Of course, the money also goes to me living out here, and me living, and expenses, and eating, and food, and groceries.
[78:34.78]But a huge amount of it goes right to the stream.
[78:40.51]Right immediately back.
[78:48.64]Because I always told myself, years ago, if I was ever in a position to be able to do something like this, that I was going to try to do it, right?
[78:56.87]And I wanted to do the things that I wanted to do.
[79:01.69]What the fuck is in there?
[79:06.56]Can you see that?
[79:08.52]Oh, you can.
[79:08.92]Okay, so these come up.
[79:19.97]Is it full?
[79:20.65]Okay, so that folds in.
[79:21.69]And that one goes in.
[79:27.17]Like that, right?
[79:30.64]It's a wasp in your labo.
[79:35.10]Put it out, put it out, put it when you put it out.
[79:38.81]Show finances on stream.
[79:44.41]Let me get a refill.
[79:46.83]If you want money information, the green screen screen will probably be about, in total, probably $1,200.
[79:52.84]Just to get it done.
[80:05.50]And that's really reasonable, considering all the shit that I'm going to be doing.
[80:17.03]I'm going to... Stop donating.
[80:23.88]He's getting too powerful.
[80:27.98]Was that $100?
[80:32.76]Add that to the green screen list, by the way.
[80:34.08]I have to do that.
[80:36.66]Pocket Pauling, give another $100.
[80:48.00]Thank you, dude.
[80:49.74]Jerma, did you know I'm running out of things to say, to be honest.
[80:52.10]Thank you for being my favorite YouTuber, and you deserve every single cent.
[80:55.92]You deserve the world.
[80:56.91]Also, shout out to Blue 2018.
[80:59.35]And also, my pronouns are they and them for future reference.
[81:03.19]Transgender pride.
[81:05.41]Absolutely.
[81:07.21]Thank you so much, Pocket Polly.
[81:12.21]I don't know.
[81:12.65]I don't think I deserve the world.
[81:13.69]I really don't.
[81:15.27]I'm just trying to do my best.
[81:18.07]Which I think is something that... That's all I care about.
[81:21.79]I just want to do my best.
[81:22.86]And if my best is good enough, then it is.
[81:24.44]And if it isn't, then it's not.
[81:26.02]But... For the future, I will keep that in mind for sure.
[81:34.30]And... Yeah.
[81:37.16]You're giving a fucking shitload of money.
[81:40.72]I don't want to take over the world.
[81:42.70]I wouldn't want that.
[81:44.40]I feel like... I don't think it would... I don't think it would go well.
[81:50.09]I would replace every M&M.
[81:51.39]You know, that'd be the first thing I would do.
[81:54.53]Oh, what's your first order of business?
[81:55.53]Oh, well, you know, we got healthcare.
[81:56.93]We've got... Oh, we've got, like, taxes.
[81:58.73]No, I'm going to replace every M&M, which is with green M&Ms.
[82:03.78]That's it.
[82:04.76]That's going to take a long fucking time.
[82:06.26]It's going to take a lot of work.
[82:08.06]A lot of work.
[82:13.96]Alright, what piece am I on?
[82:17.09]Got it.
[82:24.41]Why would you do the green M&Ms?
[82:25.83]Because those have the best candy coating flavor.
[82:31.74]That's it.
[82:32.56]Done.
[82:34.76]I'm done.
[82:36.44]I did it.
[82:36.88]Why am I trying to yell to him?
[82:38.62]Alright.
[82:39.84]First flip the... We got two now.
[82:43.49]One, two.
[82:46.45]Uh, yeah.
[82:48.60]Dremel, everything you know is a lie with that attitude.
[82:56.48]Now we have to lick it shut.
[82:58.12]It's like an envelope.
[83:12.17]Which piece is this one?
[83:13.33]This one.
[83:15.75]So, wait a minute.
[83:16.78]Shut up, Nintendo.
[83:19.76]This comes up.
[83:26.14]Stomp on it.
[83:27.06]I'm not gonna... Why would I stomp on this?
[83:30.17]I can't fuck this place up.
[83:32.03]Okay?
[83:35.41]So then this... Now lay the base on top of the pedal.
[83:38.47]I'm sure it can handle the weight.
[83:56.61]Okay.
[84:02.65]Roll the whole thing over on its side.
[84:04.13]That bottom flap should tuck neatly under.
[84:05.91]I am going to break this.
[84:10.41]It probably will happen.
[84:12.61]So roll on its side.
[84:13.95]Like that.
[84:18.13]What in the absolute heckfire do you want me to do here?
[84:21.32]Lock the pedal and bass together.
[84:23.20]So this folds down.
[84:28.94]Like that.
[84:30.83]And then this goes in.
[84:31.69]Like that.
[84:48.12]Okay.
[84:48.88]It goes in there, right?
[84:56.54]Am I doing that right?
[84:57.32]Is that correct?
[85:02.80]Yeah?
[85:03.36]Oh, yeah.
[85:04.04]That's right.
[85:07.58]Everything looks nice and secure.
[85:08.84]Make sure it matches on what's on screen.
[85:10.95]It does.
[85:11.27]Flip it over.
[85:20.61]That one goes down, and this one goes... Oh!
[85:22.45]Uh-oh.
[85:26.92]Is it lined up correct?
[85:27.80]It might not be lined up right.
[85:28.74]Yeah, it is.
[85:40.41]That's in, that's in.
[85:41.83]Looks nice, secure.
[85:42.41]Hope it matches what's on screen.
[85:43.65]It does.
[85:44.99]It does, Nintendo.
[85:47.75]Turn the whole thing over so you get the eyes.
[85:50.59]And this is the part.
[85:51.99]I didn't fold this part.
[85:54.30]Yeah, I did.
[85:56.72]Down, in, in, up, secure.
[85:58.64]You got it.
[86:09.69]Up.
[86:10.67]In.
[86:12.41]In.
[86:13.81]Pedal is done.
[86:15.35]Done.
[86:15.83]There it is.
[86:21.07]Am I making a shoebox?
[86:22.48]No, this is a... I was going to say United States Postal Service pedal.
[86:32.94]What?
[86:33.10]What?
[86:35.65]Okay.
[86:36.23]Final check.
[86:36.61]Got everything in the right place.
[86:38.45]Pedal is getting tired of supporting the base, so let's flip them right way up.
[86:44.24]That's it.
[86:45.08]All that for this.
[86:47.04]And that's our base and pedal all joined up.
[86:48.42]Here's to a long and happy relationship.
[86:51.22]Now we're going to need some rubber bands.
[86:54.05]Okay.
[86:54.47]There are two types, so make sure you've got the big ones.
[87:01.79]Okay.
[87:02.95]Crack it open.
[87:04.99]That was the slowest petal.
[87:06.11]I'm... I'm sorry.
[87:09.21]It's been an hour and 25 minutes.
[87:11.61]I gotta... Come on.
[87:12.55]We're gonna get snappy here.
[87:13.39]Don't worry.
[87:15.17]Where are the big ones?
[87:16.09]There's only a few.
[87:16.79]How many do I need?
[87:20.23]Oh!
[87:20.39]There are worms in here!
[87:21.69]Oh!
[87:24.17]That's not funny.
[87:24.71]Don't do that.
[87:25.09]I mean, there are three big ones.
[87:37.39]There's only three big ones.
[87:38.33]Hopefully they gave me enough.
[87:39.47]Do I have a defect?
[87:41.59]Fucking defect, Nintendo?
[87:46.35]Alright, so we got three.
[87:48.63]First, flip the whole pedal wide open.
[87:50.33]Wow, so flexible.
[87:51.91]Whoa, easy there.
[87:54.17]Can mine do that?
[87:56.07]What if mine can't do that?
[88:03.06]I can't go that far.
[88:04.22]Ah!
[88:05.66]Ow!
[88:07.29]I can't go th- AHH!
[88:09.21]It hurts.
[88:09.57]I have 50 more dollars.
[88:14.21]Ugh.
[88:17.92]I can't believe these people are still giving me this much money.
[88:20.16]You guys are fucking incredible.
[88:22.14]Uh, DivUSP gave 52 dollars.
[88:25.28]Hey, DermaSenses is basically a money stream.
[88:27.42]Heh.
[88:30.10]I just want to donate like, fuck it, LOL.
[88:33.27]But seriously though, wanted to thank you for everything.
[88:35.33]These past few months have been really bad, just depressing, stressful, and painful as hell.
[88:39.71]But as of recent, things have been getting slightly better, like finally getting a job, building opportunities.
[88:44.54]And even though I don't want to get my hopes up, I feel like things are slowly improving.
[88:48.24]Want to say thanks since your stream helped me out a lot.
[88:52.06]uh first of all I'm I'm ecstatic that you're starting to see some opportunities and that things are starting to look up a little bit here uh I'm I'm shocked every day man that people like that I can help you like honestly I'm more than humbled and more than happy to do it I really hope you do well
[89:23.84]As a 33-year-old man, let me tell you, it takes a long time.
[89:27.93]It takes more than you think.
[89:28.75]I remember 10 years ago when I was in my early 20s, I was like, holy shit, what's happening?
[89:34.59]What am I doing?
[89:35.21]What do I have to do with my life?
[89:36.30]What am I doing?
[89:36.78]I need to get a job, right?
[89:37.94]I'm just in a college.
[89:39.74]I had a fucking illness, right?
[89:40.96]And you figure it out.
[89:43.04]You kind of do.
[89:46.94]But thank you so much.
[89:49.27]I hope you're on the right path.
[89:50.29]I hope you are on the path that you want to be on, right?
[89:57.19]Take care of yourself.
[89:58.79]You're the most important person in the world, especially up here.
[90:03.13]So take care.
[90:05.07]Thank you so much for even being here, man.
[90:09.09]That's advice that I needed.
[90:11.61]It's advice that I needed too.
[90:14.17]When I was 25, 26, 24.
[90:18.99]As somebody that's, you know, a little older, you kind of figure it out.
[90:29.72]Took me like seven years straight to figure it out.
[90:36.76]I'm just like skipping the movie here.
[90:38.26]Okay, hold on.
[90:38.90]But thank you so much, dude.
[90:40.38]I wish you the best for real.
[90:43.17]You don't look 33.
[90:43.65]That's great, because when I'm 40, I'll look 30.
[90:46.77]But I'm losing my hair, so that's another problem entirely.
[90:49.61]Alright, so we're gonna do our stretch here.
[90:52.57]So those of you guys that stretch, how far can you go?
[90:54.64]I can't, like, this is my, I'm lying on my back, and these are my legs straight in the air.
[90:58.20]So like, I can't do this.
[91:01.74]Like, that hurts, right?
[91:06.38]I could do that, but like, this hurts a lot.
[91:10.00]Okay, so where's the rubber band?
[91:13.02]This goes through here.
[91:17.34]Through the little rubber band slots.
[91:18.94]I'm assuming that's what those are.
[91:19.98]Make sure it's perfect.
[91:21.04]Make sure it's perfect.
[91:25.14]I tried stretching and accidentally broke my mother's neck.
[91:30.22]Be more... Be careful.
[91:31.18]What?
[91:35.20]That goes in there?
[91:35.92]Am I wearing a toupee?
[91:43.65]No, it's real!
[91:46.71]Not a toupee.
[91:48.35]Actually, I had a huge confidence boost.
[91:50.81]Wait a minute.
[91:51.83]I had a huge confidence boost.
[91:53.00]I went to get my hair cut, right?
[91:54.98]So I got a haircut, those of you that have noticed.
[91:57.52]Didn't even notice my haircut.
[91:59.18]So in the haircut place, as I'm getting my haircut, haircut lady says to me, to my face into the mirror, right?
[92:07.66]Because I'm looking in the mirror, looking at her face through the mirror, she's looking at me through the mirror.
[92:11.00]Wow, you have really nice hair.
[92:12.74]How old are you?
[92:16.95]What'd you say?
[92:17.47]33.
[92:18.47]It was great.
[92:25.71]And then I walked out of there like... Like I was a fucking maniac, you know what I mean?
[92:30.05]On top of the world.
[92:32.69]My mouse is not there.
[92:33.51]Those of you guys that caught that, I'm sorry.
[92:35.87]And now my mouse doesn't do this.
[92:37.35]This does.
[92:37.77]Alright, lift the pedal all the way up.
[92:41.16]The rubber band's not twisted.
[92:45.82]No, that looks fine, right?
[92:53.33]It's perfect.
[92:56.35]Now let's close the pedal back down.
[92:57.55]That's much better.
[92:59.75]Pedal and bass are complete.
[93:03.59]Time check.
[93:05.50]60 to 90 minutes.
[93:10.08]It's been 90 minutes.
[93:13.46]They say that to everybody?
[93:14.42]No, they don't.
[93:15.10]They say...
[93:17.49]I mean, I gave her a good tip.
[93:19.71]Is that what she was... Did I get, like, tip scammed?
[93:30.46]Yeah, I was like... Hold on.
[93:34.00]Here, take that.
[93:40.94]Whatever.
[93:42.16]She still said it.
[93:43.40]So part three, this needs to get, we make the frame.
[93:45.30]Let's get this out of the way.
[93:46.14]We need D. This can move as well.
[93:51.22]We need D. D. It smells like gasoline.
[94:11.57]Why?
[94:11.93]Oh my God.
[94:21.24]Pocket Pauling.
[94:23.84]Jess gave another $50.
[94:38.59]Pocket Pauling says, if there's one thing I actually want from you from my B-Day actually, it'd be for you to tell us one thing.
[94:44.90]Just say this one thing.
[94:46.80]It's very important.
[94:51.62]He's a no-life nerd who's never gotten... Something...
[95:07.77]A cat before in their... A cat before in their entire life.
[95:26.93]A foal... Okay, what is a cat?
[95:28.61]A cat is a cat.
[95:29.81]Okay?
[95:31.13]Cat.
[95:31.53]What is a thesaurus for a cat?
[95:37.92]Kitten.
[95:38.84]Cat.
[95:42.34]Feline.
[95:50.85]Garfield.
[95:52.79]Pussycat.
[96:03.29]Ding, ding.
[96:03.67]He said it.
[96:08.58]Wiser words have never been spoken before or since.
[96:12.25]No, I'm sure they have.
[96:16.18]Just edit it.
[96:18.28]Just do the fucking sentence mixing.
[96:21.76]Trying to run from my past.
[96:35.27]He's socially awkward?
[96:36.51]I am not socially awkward.
[96:37.69]You ever meet me in public?
[96:40.19]Hey, let's, fine.
[96:40.85]You want to talk socially awkward?
[96:42.13]Those are your eyes.
[96:44.87]Like walking down the street here.
[96:48.08]Danny, Danny, what's up, man?
[96:49.72]Danny, how you been?
[96:50.74]It's good to see you again.
[96:51.98]Are you, um, yeah, I'll shake your hand for sure.
[96:54.84]I got a good grip like you do.
[96:56.02]Yeah, we both have good grips.
[96:57.02]Both not socially awkward at all.
[96:59.18]So you still, um, you still at the printing company?
[97:03.83]Nice dude, nice, awesome, awesome.
[97:06.61]Me, I do online media.
[97:09.83]It's like a thing where you, it's online presence, an online presence, online.
[97:20.47]How's a printing company going?
[97:23.81]See, that's how every conversation I have with people goes.
[97:26.88]Not socially awkward at all.
[97:38.15]nice job but pocket polling thank you so much you you've gone above and beyond at this point monetarily and it's I took them both out and I wasn't supposed to I fucked it up whatever we'll save it just need these two you missed my donation um those of you that are almost hit the mic
[98:08.08]That was the right one, right?
[98:08.92]Yeah.
[98:09.86]Those of you that are somewhat new to the channel, potentially, I don't read anything really during the stream unless it's... Obviously, if it's $50, like 20 subs, those are huge amounts that I want to obviously address immediately.
[98:24.76]But we do a hangout after the stream where I go over all the bits, all the bit messages and everything.
[98:29.70]So I just don't do it during the stream.
[98:33.04]He only reads huge donations.
[98:37.88]It's not untrue.
[98:39.12]So I can't be like, no, no.
[98:40.84]It's not untrue.
[98:46.66]Fix the Discord integration.
[98:49.22]Well, I'm a moron.
[98:50.33]So I haven't done that yet.
[98:52.75]I will someday.
[98:55.67]Alright.
[98:56.29]I'm ready.
[98:57.23]This goes like this.
[98:58.91]Like this.
[98:59.47]Good.
[99:04.93]Let's fold it all up.
[99:05.99]I know how to do that.
[99:06.79]You guys can still... You might need to turn the brightness up a little bit here just because it is getting a little dark.
[99:12.19]It is 440.
[99:16.09]It's... Why is time... I'm time traveling right now.
[99:25.71]Oh, what happened to Lego Island?
[99:26.91]Okay, so let me explain this while I have a minute here.
[99:28.93]I...
[99:36.20]So everyone wants me to play Lego Island and... Hold on.
[99:54.09]I bought some... I got a Raspberry P. I got a Raspberry P.
[100:06.20]I was going to do a thing where I built a Raspberry Pi computer and install Lego Island on it and play it.
[100:11.92]That was going to be the shtick.
[100:14.42]Make sure you do your research before you buy anything.
[100:15.88]You can't run Windows on here.
[100:17.78]You can't install it.
[100:18.46]You have to go through.
[100:20.42]And there it goes.
[100:22.22]You can't install Windows on your Pi.
[100:31.45]Now I just have the P. What am I supposed to do with my PP now?
[100:35.95]That I don't know.
[100:42.39]Somebody wanted me to prove it, and it was there, so.
[100:45.81]I can run Linux, but Lego Island does not run on Linux, it runs on Windows.
[100:50.44]So I would have to get Linux installed on my P, and then install a virtual machine on Linux for Windows 98 on the P,
[101:01.26]which is already slow enough, it would be like 0.02 frames a second.
[101:09.52]But that does not mean that I will not use that for something.
[101:12.21]We're going to build a dumb computer at some point.
[101:14.77]I have all the peripherals.
[101:15.65]I'm going to build a fucking computer with that thing, and we're going to do something with it.
[101:19.49]I don't know what we're going to do.
[101:22.50]You're saying it wrong.
[101:23.38]I'm sorry.
[101:25.44]Oh, Etalyx told me last night to make sure I didn't say P.
[101:32.99]I said it.
[101:33.27]Alright, let's fold.
[101:39.09]Raspberry Pi.
[101:40.02]Whatever.
[101:43.34]I can't even fucking run Lego Island.
[101:45.76]What's it worth?
[102:04.30]But it actually came with a, so the original original plan was, that's like a Google voice recognition box.
[102:14.34]And I was gonna make that on stream.
[102:15.73]We were gonna make a robot that I could talk to on stream.
[102:19.25]And it uses a Raspberry Pi.
[102:22.45]And oh my God, it's a 100, the instructions are 100 steps long.
[102:32.38]There was no way I was gonna... There was just no way.
[102:38.87]And it needed my IP address, and, like, I'm not gonna show my IP address on stream.
[102:44.31]That's like a death sentence.
[102:47.72]Oh, by the way, here's my IP!
[102:50.52]See ya!
[102:53.80]Like, you needed to... It has to, like, link up to your internet and show it.
[102:56.32]Alright, so that's all folded.
[103:07.44]It's fine if it needs an internal IP.
[103:09.04]Oh, yeah, that's fine.
[103:10.04]It would just connect to, like, a router, but... I... I don't... I... We just got our internet fixed.
[103:19.53]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[103:20.27]You know what I'm saying?
[103:21.13]Alright, so make pizza.
[103:22.51]Make pizza.
[103:40.22]Oh, I didn't do it.
[103:42.16]I thought it was in the slot.
[103:44.46]Oh.
[103:49.44]Got it.
[103:56.39]What if somebody guessed your IP address?
[104:02.35]There's, I don't, that's not even like a fucking reality.
[104:09.36]That's like somebody trying to guess cryptocurrency wallets.
[104:13.46]I'll get it one day.
[104:14.27]Looks good.
[104:27.58]What is that?
[104:32.52]When is the poll for the green screen stream?
[104:35.15]That is a great question, and you will get it, I will tell you at the end of the stream.
[104:43.58]I forgot to do it.
[104:53.99]What do I need?
[105:03.85]The big one?
[105:04.66]There's only one, right?
[105:05.52]This is the only one?
[105:08.24]I guess.
[105:13.94]You guys can narrow it.
[105:15.52]I don't, wait, what?
[105:16.42]Just relax, man.
[105:17.54]Like, come on.
[105:22.31]Relax.
[105:22.99]There's no need for this.
[105:24.95]Alright.
[105:25.37]So now we're going to need the grip stickers from the bag.
[105:28.79]Their rough surface will help our pedal from sliding around.
[105:31.07]Okay.
[105:36.38]What is the purpose of the handles on the table serve?
[105:43.21]That.
[105:51.17]So, a grip sticker.
[105:54.54]If you have trouble spotting the gas between the stickers, try gently bending them a bit.
[105:58.44]Okay, I do.
[105:59.02]I see them.
[106:02.72]We've got to get some brightness in here, I think.
[106:05.43]Not yet.
[106:06.89]Relax.
[106:11.65]So how many?
[106:12.09]We just need one strip?
[106:13.93]Let's take a look at where the sticker is going to go.
[106:15.65]It's going to go in the pizza?
[106:18.16]Just don't say food items.
[106:19.20]I'm hungry.
[106:21.32]So one, two there, and then one all the way in the back.
[106:24.56]There.
[106:30.08]Move a long sticker from the sheet.
[106:31.48]Carefully, you don't get it stuck on anything.
[106:36.45]Where does it go so I can prepare it?
[106:39.55]One into the sticker there, and then it's going to wrap around, all the way around, and then there.
[106:48.49]You got it.
[106:51.74]You got it, man.
[106:57.86]How'd you like that?
[106:58.70]Oh, okay, so let's go thumb side first.
[107:04.38]Goes right here.
[107:15.44]Flip it around, and then this goes along the edge.
[107:20.30]That.
[107:27.59]That, and like that.
[107:30.27]Sweet!
[107:31.57]Sweet!
[107:36.06]Huh?
[107:36.94]Okay.
[107:39.64]Big bits.
[107:42.30]We had $10 from a free iPod.
[107:47.73]What the fuck do I do with my life?
[107:49.31]I'm stuck.
[107:50.59]Boat.
[107:51.53]And hearing you say that figuring shit out takes time really helps with the anxiety that comes with those thoughts.
[107:57.26]Wish I could join in on the big bits, but I'm broke, so just take the rest of my bits that I have lying around.
[108:02.06]Thanks for making the best content.
[108:04.66]Thanks to the free iPod, first of all, and the $10.
[108:06.20]Uh...
[108:09.90]Yeah, as somebody that did not even understand the position that I could even possibly be in, five to 10 years ago, I was just up in the air.
[108:19.83]I just had no idea what was going on.
[108:22.41]I didn't know where I was or where I was going.
[108:24.59]And you just kind of figure something out.
[108:28.15]It just kind of happens.
[108:29.57]And it might be something you don't even know.
[108:30.99]It's like, oh, I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this, and I'm going to do this.
[108:34.03]That's probably not true.
[108:35.07]It might be something else entirely.
[108:39.72]Thank you so much, Free iPod.
[108:43.64]How did I sustain myself before Twitch?
[108:45.04]I had all kinds of odd jobs.
[108:46.20]I did videography.
[108:47.20]I was a substitute teacher.
[108:49.63]I... It was mostly videography.
[108:53.49]I filmed weddings.
[108:55.11]Just freelance.
[108:57.75]I did that for a long time.
[108:59.75]I worked at... I was an aide.
[109:03.57]I was a teacher's aide for a long time as well.
[109:09.23]But subject, I didn't teach a certain subject.
[109:11.05]I just was a substitute teacher for a school district.
[109:19.24]But you just kind of do whatever until you find out what you're going to do.
[109:22.38]And sometimes it kind of comes out of left field.
[109:33.66]I had to teach math once, right?
[109:34.98]Yeah, I've had to teach math a couple of times and it was just, I had no idea what the fuck to do.
[109:39.12]It was bad.
[109:43.55]And it always sucks because when you know that the students know way more than you and it's very clear, it's just embarrassing.
[109:56.37]It really is fucking embarrassing.
[110:00.64]I've had my kid shit himself in class.
[110:03.55]I... Why would... No, first of all, I did not... Okay, I need to fold this.
[110:18.22]Like that.
[110:22.22]You teach freshman driver's ed and it's hell.
[110:24.70]I could probably teach driver's ed.
[110:28.51]I'm a very good real life driver.
[110:34.73]This goes right in the middle, right?
[110:36.31]Like this.
[110:39.76]All the way through.
[110:42.76]It's a tight fit, but you can do it.
[110:44.24]And then all the way through.
[110:45.10]I feel like I'm in candlelight right now.
[110:55.90]One side and the other.
[110:59.42]There it is.
[111:00.08]Nice and snug.
[111:02.87]I gotta pee.
[111:04.15]Don't go anywhere.
[111:04.96]Don't go anywhere.
[111:05.48]I gotta pee.
[111:06.92]How do I turn the BRB screen on?
[111:10.52]What the hell is that?
[111:14.46]Oh, that's the wine.
[111:17.90]This is the wine spigot.
[111:24.24]Hold on, hold on.
[111:24.84]I got it.
[111:28.22]Alright, I'll be right back.
[114:27.03]I'm back.
[114:40.71]It's like I never left.
[114:41.47]Oh yeah, you think this is cool?
[114:43.99]Watch this.
[114:47.85]This chair was way too expensive.
[114:48.99]It's not even good.
[114:50.27]Alright, now it's time for the locked left frame on the pedal base.
[114:52.96]Get over here, pedal base.
[114:54.32]What?
[115:01.05]The ones of this over here now.
[115:07.03]We spent three hours on the part that says it'll be one.
[115:09.31]It's only been an hour and 55 minutes.
[115:15.18]And about 30 of that was the huge amount of money that came in, 30 minutes or so.
[115:19.36]So we've really only been about an hour and 30 minutes on this part.
[115:22.94]What are you getting three?
[115:23.76]What are you getting three?
[115:33.08]Blame the donators.
[115:38.79]Turn up the volume.
[115:40.05]No.
[115:40.91]Sure.
[115:42.75]Don't listen to them.
[115:44.03]Do what you want to do.
[115:44.89]But what if they leave?
[115:46.39]I don't fucking care.
[115:48.39]Do what you want to do.
[115:49.27]Alright.
[115:57.30]So left is this one here.
[116:05.98]Like this?
[116:08.55]How the fuck does it want me to do this?
[116:12.27]Stand at the frame and base piece, so stand this up.
[116:18.75]That's standing this way.
[116:20.19]And then I got a tab here, so it's gotta go like this.
[116:34.18]We need brightness?
[116:35.62]Alright, I'm gonna say, do I need brightness, and then I want everyone in the chat to say yes or no.
[116:39.44]Do I need brightness?
[116:46.24]Okay.
[116:52.68]That's all I needed to hear?
[116:59.83]Oh, that's too much.
[117:02.57]That's fine.
[117:07.35]Make sure we're not, like, ghosting, you know what I mean?
[117:14.48]Can turn the lights up probably a little bit higher.
[117:20.44]That's good, right?
[117:22.58]Not 15 FPS.
[117:23.55]I don't want to keep it like that.
[117:24.45]That looks fine.
[117:26.91]Let me do the other one here.
[117:27.75]This is what happens when you start streaming in the light and it turns into dark.
[117:41.38]Just kind of does this.
[117:48.96]It's not 60 FPS.
[117:50.79]I can't handle 60 FPS.
[117:52.03]You can't even see faster than the human eye 24.
[117:53.69]Let me break.
[117:57.79]Alright, where's the level?
[118:01.75]Right there, okay.
[118:08.05]Nice shirt.
[118:08.55]Thanks, man.
[118:08.89]Alright, so this goes in like that.
[118:11.23]Stick it in, and then the tab closes.
[118:13.22]So this has to go in like this.
[118:17.92]You can't see 4K.
[118:18.96]Then you can see 4K.
[118:25.91]And you can't see 4K, but your TV can.
[118:29.47]Ooh, that went in.
[118:30.83]Hopefully that's the right way.
[118:36.59]So this comes up like this.
[118:43.15]Is that an Amani shirt?
[118:46.93]No, it's like a $12 bargain bin Nightwing shirt.
[118:54.59]That's it.
[118:59.63]Enraged Grandpa just gave $10.
[119:03.06]Thank you.
[119:04.42]No message.
[119:09.05]No, it's Nightwing.
[119:12.53]I was going to be Nightwing for Halloween this year, but I was too fat to be in the suit.
[119:16.17]I looked ugly.
[119:16.75]It looked shitty.
[119:17.35]It was like my stomach hung out and it didn't look good.
[119:19.19]And if you go out, if you're going to go out and you're going to wear like a Nightwing shirt, are you going to be like Nightwing?
[119:23.96]Oh boy.
[119:24.42]You bet you got to, you can't just, you can't have like fat stomach.
[119:29.36]It was like, and I go, and I look at, I'm like, look at how sexy I can look in my fucking Nightwing spandex.
[119:36.20]No way.
[119:39.99]Like, if I shook my stomach, you'd hear fucking liquid.
[119:47.81]Nightwing was a loser.
[119:58.73]Alright.
[119:59.30]Whoa.
[119:59.86]Let's keep going here.
[120:03.06]Oh, you read that one.
[120:05.32]Yep, I did.
[120:07.58]Yep.
[120:08.42]I read them all, guys.
[120:11.24]Does Jerma pay attention to chat?
[120:12.56]I read them all.
[120:14.95]All of them.
[120:16.37]All of them.
[120:20.95]All of them.
[120:23.31]That one.
[120:23.59]Even this one.
[120:24.03]This one.
[120:24.31]Yep.
[120:25.23]He won't read this.
[120:25.81]Yes, I will.
[120:28.75]Alright.
[120:29.11]Let's do the... Let's get this one hour and 60 minute piece done.
[120:32.31]Okay.
[120:32.45]There's this one.
[120:33.77]I'm going to need another one.
[120:34.97]Okay.
[120:35.21]I know this one.
[120:35.71]I can do it quick.
[120:37.91]Let's move this out of the way.
[120:39.11]We don't need it for now.
[120:44.07]Fold, fold, fold, fold.
[120:46.99]If you read this one, scream Inspector Gadget.
[120:49.63]I'm not going to scream, I just said Inspector Gadget, which proves that I read it.
[120:52.19]Alright, the whole thing folds up.
[120:57.04]Just fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.
[120:58.54]This is the other side of the pedal.
[120:59.54]How am I going to get the camera set up so you can see everything?
[121:02.58]That's going to be weird, isn't it?
[121:07.83]1 hour and 50 minutes, don't you mean 2 hours?
[121:09.69]No, 2 hours would be 1 hour and then 60 minutes go by and that's 2 hours.
[121:14.79]So it has not been 2 hours, it's been 1 hour and 50 minutes.
[121:19.40]Well, it's been 2 hours and 2 minutes.
[121:24.38]So that's wrong.
[121:31.03]You said 60.
[121:31.49]I know, 1 hour and 60 minutes have to go by for an hour to be counted.
[121:36.84]Somebody said two hours, one hour and 50 minutes, but that's not it.
[121:40.61]There's an extra 10 minutes there, man.
[121:45.43]So an hour past, no, I'm making the point that somebody said that it had been two hours and it was an hour and 50 minutes.
[122:05.10]One hour, 59 minutes, and 60 seconds.
[122:07.02]That's correct.
[122:08.38]God, I'm glad somebody gets it.
[122:19.69]Eat the cardboard.
[122:21.77]I don't think I will.
[122:31.28]Alright, so I always see, you guys have to give me some info here.
[122:35.88]I always see people say, like, oh, eat that, eat cardboard, eat Weibo, chew on glass, right?
[122:44.15]Are there streamers that you go in their chat and you say like, oh, eat pants.
[122:48.47]And they're like, okay.
[122:51.43]And they just start, do they do that?
[122:53.20]Is that like a thing?
[122:57.00]Do you guys convince people to eat shit they're not supposed to eat?
[122:59.56]Is that like a Twitch thing?
[123:06.29]Vinny did it one time.
[123:08.31]Vinny ate his pants on stream.
[123:10.96]He did?
[123:20.14]He did.
[123:23.65]Why?
[123:24.09]Why did he do that?
[123:25.57]I need more context.
[123:29.55]Now I have to do it.
[123:30.65]Why would I?
[123:31.87]Why?
[123:32.25]I don't have to do it.
[123:39.18]There's that.
[123:39.74]Okay, make sure I did that right.
[123:40.80]I did.
[123:41.30]It was crazy.
[123:44.16]He's a real madman.
[123:48.42]Open your window and scream out of it.
[123:55.19]Okay.
[123:57.13]Okay.
[123:57.93]I will.
[124:06.37]I'm not gonna... I'm kidding.
[124:08.61]Same thing with this.
[124:09.65]Goes right there.
[124:11.79]We're almost done with 5% of the whole Labo.
[124:16.19]Are you guys prepared, huh?
[124:20.47]Are you prepared, huh?
[124:28.24]No.
[124:36.84]Fix your posture.
[124:37.64]My posture's fucking flawless.
[124:44.00]Okay, we're fine.
[124:57.27]Posture, look.
[125:00.31]Anytime somebody says, oh, fix your posture, you always just go like, okay.
[125:05.85]People don't sit like this.
[125:13.39]Lick the cardboard.
[125:14.11]I paid you.
[125:15.81]Like, top to bottom?
[125:17.37]Or, like, how do you want me to do it?
[125:24.66]Have I been gnome today?
[125:25.56]I haven't been gnome in, like, a week.
[125:27.18]Two weeks.
[125:29.44]Alright, we did this part.
[125:30.18]We're good.
[125:36.61]Shave your beard on stream.
[125:37.49]I already did that.
[125:38.65]I already showed my fucking skills.
[125:44.41]Where's that piece?
[125:57.92]Read a book?
[125:59.06]No, I'm playing Labo, man.
[126:00.95]This is the only other time I'm ever going to get to do this.
[126:02.87]You guys, you realize that, right?
[126:05.66]This, hey look, I'm playing Labo.
[126:09.26]Gotcha!
[126:09.90]Like, I can't do this ever again.
[126:11.22]So, just let me have this.
[126:18.46]What's it like getting the senior discount?
[126:19.82]It's fucking awesome, actually.
[126:21.46]You get like 20% off literally everywhere you go.
[126:24.70]Whoa, what's it like saving money everywhere you go?
[126:27.37]That's great, man.
[126:28.13]It's great.
[126:28.89]You want me to say it sucks?
[126:30.61]Oh, that sucks.
[126:31.65]I hate saving money everywhere.

[126:58.40]I'm going to get a haircut next week.

[127:08.14]And she'll have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
[127:17.64]So this goes in like that, right?
[127:19.84]Yeah.

[136:21.28]Oh, now you're getting weird here.
[136:23.32]Alright, so this has come up, and then it has to go through those slots.

[137:27.66]Oh, this is going to break.
[137:42.14]You'll control the toy compatible with your foot.
[137:43.95]Try stepping on it to check how it feels.
[137:56.46]Let's try it out.
[138:01.98]That actually feels pretty good.
[138:08.01]See?

[139:28.41]Push the pedal all the way down with one hand and hold it there.
[139:33.23]And then it goes in like this.

[139:49.92]Slide the Joy-Con into the hole with the minus button sticking out, and make sure it's in.

[146:58.31]No, yeah.
[146:59.33]Yeah, that's what's gonna happen for this one.
[147:02.29]I want a fucking 15 minute timer on the screen.
[147:07.63]How do I add one?
[147:11.64]Let's give me 20 minutes.
[147:16.94]I'd have to get, like, a plugin or something, I think.
[147:18.93]I don't think I can do it from just an OBS.
[147:31.66]Just, we count for you.
[147:32.76]Okay.
[147:34.52]Use your, yeah, use your phone!
[147:35.80]Use your phone!
[147:38.20]Damn it!
[147:46.78]I almost just locked my phone out for like three days.
[147:57.02]Okay.
[147:57.92]You ready?
[148:00.53]Wait, hold on.
[148:04.43]Two Steps Key and Joy-Con.
[148:06.31]I'm gonna move this out of the way.
[148:10.39]So it starts when I grab the paper.
[148:11.95]So I need C.
[148:17.74]I just wanna see.
[148:22.82]Right?
[148:25.06]Okay, so I grabbed it.
[148:26.06]Okay, go.
[148:31.80]Can you see it?
[148:39.07]That's such a bad, it's gonna turn off.
[148:41.81]That's gonna turn off.
[148:42.95]Like it's gonna go to like my home screen.
[148:44.53]Just, I can see it.
[148:45.95]Okay, let's go.
[148:56.94]What do I need?
[149:13.01]Empty, right?
[149:13.73]Empty.
[149:17.57]Okay, alright, alright, let's go.
[149:20.75]Almost one minute.
[149:21.37]I'm gonna start with the key, this key, this is the key, this one here, that's a key.
[149:26.91]Make sure the piece of- printing on it.
[149:29.39]Flip it.
[149:32.67]There's so many folds here.
[149:33.77]It's gonna take 20 minutes to do these folds.
[149:44.30]One.
[149:45.42]Two.
[149:47.00]Three.
[149:48.66]Four.
[149:49.76]Five.
[149:52.18]Six.
[149:54.18]Seven.
[149:55.89]Eight.
[149:57.64]Time.
[149:58.22]One minute and 30 seconds.
[150:01.01]Seven.
[150:02.39]Eight.
[150:04.01]Nine.
[150:05.37]One.
[150:06.03]Two.
[150:06.55]Three.
[150:07.60]One.
[150:08.10]All folded.
[150:08.78]All done.
[150:09.22]Go.
[150:09.54]What's next?
[150:10.28]What's next?
[150:33.64]stop doing like a bad posture thing like I'm doing like I'm trying to get you guys to go bad posture I don't know why this comes up slides through like that and then in nice and snug look at that
[151:02.35]this same thing on the other side it goes down and around makes a little cube like that use the locking piece to hold everything in place flip piece over and fold it in half three minutes three minutes that's not gonna be I'm not gonna be close
[151:31.68]So it goes like that.
[151:32.66]This one popped out a little bit.
[151:34.46]Fuck.
[151:36.69]Okay, so then it goes in here like this.
[151:42.66]So that's locked straight through.
[151:46.83]Just a moment, take a moment to check that yours looks like this.
[151:49.61]It does.
[151:50.61]The two knobby bits poking up from one side, it's in, it looks like that, it looks beautiful.
[151:55.72]Looks better than your picture, dickhead.
[151:58.36]Alright, no, that was mean.
[151:59.96]Now, this piece may be small but it's tough, be sure to fold it cleanly and firmly.
[152:02.69]These long, thin bits are a bit tricky, use both hands.
[152:17.33]I can feel the bass drum in my brain.
[152:19.55]Is it loud?
[152:24.37]Should I turn it down?
[152:25.23]I don't know what the music sounds like because I can't hear it.
[152:34.68]Somebody said that, I didn't say that.
[152:38.72]Four minutes.
[152:47.00]no one said yes they did yes they did I can hear the scroll up you'll see it I was the guy that said it come clean here this piece just won't come out just perforated already why do I have to do this alright
[153:15.97]Fold it back.
[153:17.55]Back.
[153:21.53]Like this.
[153:22.19]Ooh, this is... I gotta be careful here, for real, because this will rip.
[153:26.15]This one comes back.
[153:28.33]This one comes back.
[153:32.20]Oh, man.
[153:32.50]There's so many little tiny pieces here.
[153:34.42]Okay.
[153:41.64]Just fold them all.
[153:43.95]Oof.
[153:47.71]What's that thing from Roblox?
[154:09.68]Wash your hands?
[154:10.92]Wash your hair?
[154:11.80]What are you talking about?
[154:14.62]My hair is clean.
[154:18.52]I take a shower every day.
[154:20.50]Every single day.
[154:23.24]Every single day.
[154:33.17]Every tiny little piece needs 15 minutes, my ass.
[154:39.89]This little folding bit alone is going to take 15 minutes.
[154:47.05]You don't take a shower three times a day?
[154:48.53]Who takes a shower three times a day?
[154:52.49]Do you work in, like, the mud pits?
[154:54.29]Like, I don't... Like, do you work in, like, the mud?
[154:56.23]You know what I mean?
[155:00.17]Like, yeah, that... You got... That's, like... I can understand if you worked, like, in, like, a place where you need to do it.
[155:09.30]Alright, that's done.
[155:14.71]Now where does it go?
[155:16.21]Wine should not be on the table.
[155:17.41]Nice fucking walnut desk.
[155:22.94]I can't even put it on-
[155:57.02]This seven minutes Am I doing this right?
[156:10.21]Yes, I am
[156:26.93]That piece sticks in there.
[156:34.41]Right?
[156:34.87]Okay.
[156:37.85]F-fold.
[156:38.45]Up.
[156:41.93]Fold.
[156:43.23]Fold.
[156:44.30]Up.
[156:45.20]In.
[156:45.36]And then what the hell does this thing do?
[156:47.80]In and then down?
[156:48.62]It's in.
[156:51.48]Okay.
[156:52.48]Look.
[156:53.58]Examine my work.
[156:56.87]Okay.
[156:59.04]Now check to the side, you should see the tip through the opening.
[157:05.10]Do I?
[157:07.96]Yeah, kind of.
[157:09.77]Yeah, I do.
[157:13.81]The main part of the key is complete.
[157:15.81]Might as well look kind of fucked up. 847.
[157:30.32]This piece requires extra clean folds.
[157:32.18]Be sure to crease carefully along the fold lines, just like on screen.
[157:34.36]The end result might surprise you.
[157:44.27]Extra clean folds.
[157:47.23]Can you think of anything else that has four arms and two heads?
[157:49.35]I can't.
[157:49.73]Are we dealing with a new life form here?
[157:53.47]If I had wine in my mouth, I would've spit it into the camera.
[157:55.43]Alright, hold on.
[158:00.84]Three showers per fold.
[158:10.65]Extra careful.
[158:13.05]Wine drunk.
[158:15.24]Wine is great.
[158:17.52]You want to talk crap about wine?
[158:19.26]You ever have a red blend before?
[158:20.96]No, I want to have a fucking vodka Cosmo drink.
[158:29.81]Oh, please, drink a red blend for Christ's sakes.
[158:37.81]Uh, yeah, do you guys make a, uh, sex on the beach?
[158:42.31]Get a fucking red blend for once in your life.
[158:55.42]He's a mean drunk.
[158:59.42]Telling you.
[159:00.80]You'll drink cheap.
[159:03.36]So this now goes in here.
[159:06.78]Which way?
[159:07.48]So the prongs out that way, like that.
[159:10.89]It's going to shove in 10 minutes.
[159:16.87]See how there are two different tabs on the button?
[159:18.39]One with a notch, one without.
[159:20.61]Look carefully at the screen when putting it in.
[159:24.31]I know what I'm doing.
[159:26.74]So right through here.
[159:30.96]I mean, it can't really go anywhere.
[159:33.29]It just sits here like that.
[159:42.09]Unidentified life form approaching red alert, red blend.
[159:47.00]Place it right over the button.
[159:48.36]It looks right at home there, don't you think?
[159:59.50]I mean, kind of.
[160:00.90]I guess.
[160:08.94]That's in there.
[160:09.78]It's not really secure though.
[160:12.77]Fold both of these top arms down so the tabs fit tightly into the openings.
[160:15.83]We're starting to get this alien under control.
[160:17.51]Okay.
[160:28.37]Come on, Nintendo.
[160:30.05]You can do better than this.
[160:40.78]Okay.
[160:41.86]That's fine.
[160:42.62]So that's in.
[160:43.76]Both in.
[160:44.92]He's riding on whatever this is.
[160:50.73]Now, just to be sure I won't escape, let's fold its head down between its arms.
[160:57.22]I didn't fold these.
[160:57.96]I don't think I do though.
[161:00.98]Like that.
[161:05.06]Ooh.
[161:06.10]That fits nice.
[161:09.48]Eat dinner on stream or it's pre-recorded.
[161:12.79]I'm not gonna eat fuckin' dinner on stream.
[161:17.03]Fold the arms down, same thing.
[161:18.39]Gonna do the same thing on the other side.
[161:19.53]Eat dinner.
[161:27.06]Why would I do something like that?
[161:28.44]Okay.
[161:38.37]This is kind of loose.
[161:41.51]It's supposed to be like that?
[161:42.27]13 minutes and 19 minutes.
[161:53.59]Stop.
[161:54.41]Thank you.
[161:54.95]15 to 30 minutes, huh?
[161:59.47]I fucking owned that.
[162:07.00]How do I put this in?
[162:13.30]Get the Joy-Con arm ready.
[162:14.34]It's the one with the plus button.
[162:15.72]Yes, I know which one it is.
[162:16.90]I can hear the baits in my brain.
[162:27.33]So open this slot.
[162:33.11]And it looks like a PEZ dispenser.
[162:41.73]And then this goes in.
[162:48.22]Close it and put the key in like that.
[162:50.42]So that's in.
[162:58.52]And then close this.
[163:02.26]And then fold it back and stick it in there.
[163:07.82]Done.
[163:11.16]I win.
[163:12.28]I win!
[163:15.90]Try pushing the button on the key.
[163:16.98]If it pops back out after you push it, we're good to go.
[163:37.39]Is it?
[163:37.69]I don't think that's good to go.
[163:38.99]Maybe it is.
[163:44.61]No, it is.
[163:45.03]It is.
[163:45.29]It is.
[163:45.53]It is.
[163:45.77]It is.
[163:45.97]It's fine.
[163:46.75]It's fine.
[163:47.11]It's gonna be fine.
[163:47.65]Toy key is complete.
[163:51.23]We got the key.
[163:51.61]We got the pedal.
[163:52.55]I'm ready to start fucking losing it.
[163:55.30]Alright, time to make the car.

[167:14.54]Okay, there it is.
[167:16.20]I hate that it's in here, get it out of here.

[170:42.69]Before we turn the piece off, we'll wanna crease the fold lines on these four tabs.
[170:48.21]Boop, boop, boop, boopity, boop.
[170:49.37]That's all four, okay.
[171:02.93]That wasn't a funny voice.
[171:05.15]Guys, I wouldn't be doing this.
[171:06.59]I would be doing this if I was alone, too.
[171:08.29]I would be saying, like, Thanos lines.
[171:12.68]It's done.
[171:14.42]Flip the whole thing around.
[171:15.36]This gives us this.
[171:27.61]Got any more Brain Busters, Nintendo?
[171:33.00]Oh, whoops.
[171:40.65]Uh, we got five more gifted subs.
[171:44.21]Five gifted subs from, uh, Bet3.
[171:46.59]Thank you so much, dude.
[171:53.73]Even more subs on top of the ones that were from before.
[171:56.58]Thank you guys so much.
[171:57.28]You guys are fucking amazing.
[171:58.94]Thank you.
[172:01.55]Bet three.

[172:20.54]Buy it pre-made.
[172:24.28]One.
[172:24.60]I gotta go all the way around.
[172:26.52]Just gotta do it, you know?
[172:27.36]You gotta put your pants on.
[172:28.28]You gotta do it.
[172:31.16]Does sound really nice when you do it each time though.
[172:36.02]So I have a question for everybody that's here.
[172:37.46]Am I the only person on Twitch that's done this?
[172:42.00]On stream, like the whole thing?
[172:43.42]All of them?
[172:49.10]No.
[172:51.95]I wanna meet that person.
[172:55.95]MattersOfDarkness came in with five community subs, thank you so much.
[173:02.63]You are literally the only person to ever do it.
[173:06.47]That's big, big community subs coming in from Matters of Darkness.
[173:09.85]On top of the ones from earlier.
[173:11.22]Thank you so much, dude.
[173:13.02]I don't want to- I really don't know what to say at this point.
[173:14.94]You guys are fucking too much for me.
[173:19.62]You're not the first, but you're definitely the slowest.
[173:44.24]How many total community subs tonight?
[173:46.07]Probably 150.
[173:48.19]Something crazy.
[173:50.75]Go around the inner circle.
[173:56.15]And the- in the- in the core, too?
[173:57.95]We're gonna go in the core?
[174:22.42]Look how patronizing he's being when this wheel is trying its best.
[174:25.66]That's probably my favorite comment of the whole night.
[174:32.63]That was great.
[174:33.89]Alright, let's go.
[174:38.65]Each individual piece has to come up.
[174:44.31]I'm gonna feel so satisfied when I smash this with the sledgehammer that's back there in the closet.
[174:50.67]You didn't know?
[174:51.05]That's the big joke at the end of the stream.
[174:53.44]Sludge hammer.
[174:54.80]Oh, he bought a sludge hammer for this?
[174:57.64]Yeah, he sure did.
[174:58.90]And boy, is it going to be messy.
[175:12.65]Whoa, cool.
[175:13.49]Holy shit, he sludge hammered the Labo.
[175:17.44]He still has it in his hand.
[175:19.25]The adrenaline's like getting to him.
[175:20.67]Wait, hold on.
[175:21.17]He's sludge hammering his computer.
[175:23.71]What the fuck?
[175:24.69]What face?
[175:26.41]Did I break it?
[175:28.51]No.
[175:29.05]Did I?
[175:30.83]Dude, he's sludge hammering his computer?
[175:32.41]Dude, he's sludge hammering his walls.
[175:35.07]What the fuck face?
[175:42.19]Everything has to happen.
[175:48.89]Dude, he ran off camera and I still hear crashing and smashing.
[176:10.48]Whoa!
[176:31.43]is that hdmi port I missed I should just do these at the same time this is gonna feel really cool putting it together though because all these slots have a home every single slot has a home they slots go this way and they go into their home one of my can I show you something
[176:57.22]I can't.
[176:58.26]Almost half of my fucking wall paneling has fallen down.
[177:04.67]Command strips don't do shit.
[177:09.89]Another one just fell down.
[177:13.89]Okay.
[177:15.07]We are done.
[177:16.71]It's time to put it all together.
[177:20.03]Here's the 130 minute stream that they were describing.
[177:25.81]They weren't kidding around when they said it was going to take 130 stream minutes.
[177:31.51]Put it all together, right?
[177:33.99]Or wrong?
[177:40.24]Good red blend.
[177:44.56]Wrong.
[177:46.52]Okay, this comes up.
[177:54.52]And then these go down.
[177:56.38]Like that.
[178:09.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[178:11.97]It's the second one.
[178:14.56]So this is now in the middle.
[178:16.44]I feel like I'm gonna get cut.
[178:19.04]It's like a saw blade.
[178:21.76]That comes down, and then these pieces here fold.
[178:25.84]Like that, and then in.
[178:41.01]In.
[178:42.97]In.
[178:48.86]There's so many tabs to put in.
[178:54.94]Nintendo Labo, like, Katana Sawblade.
[179:02.31]Fatality.
[179:06.21]Let's just do them all.
[179:10.85]Did I- did it flip over?
[179:22.05]Why did- did I do this wrong?
[179:28.22]No.
[179:32.83]Friendship.
[179:33.91]Friendship.
[179:35.03]Again.
[179:45.53]Blind streamer.
[179:46.33]Blind.
[179:46.79]Blind streamer.
[179:47.49]He's blind.
[179:48.01]He's blind.
[179:48.49]He's blind.
[179:48.91]He's blind.
[179:51.71]That's an unknown reference.
[179:52.71]Go play Mortal Kombat 3, you fucking idiot.
[180:00.63]You're not, I'm kidding.
[180:01.87]That was a joke.
[180:07.84]I'm, that was, I'm kidding.
[180:08.98]I'm kidding.
[180:10.66]I'm kidding.
[180:13.54]He's getting toxic.
[180:15.68]The more wine he drinks, he becomes more toxic.
[180:23.27]No, that's in Mortal Kombat 3.
[180:28.45]I was just kidding.
[180:29.15]Look, hey, come on.
[180:35.65]rewind to yesterday.
[180:39.15]Oh, sleepy.
[180:44.43]Everybody calls me an idiot when I'm like walking around in Red Dead.
[180:47.99]Oh wow, you're an idiot.
[180:52.87]Why is that okay?
[181:03.49]He sounds so kidding.
[181:12.97]Stop ignoring my question.
[181:14.13]Tell us your sub count.
[181:15.55]I don't, I don't know.
[181:16.89]What is it?
[181:17.29]65,000.
[181:19.00]Like I'm not ignoring your, what?
[181:25.88]Stop ignoring my question.
[181:27.04]How much money is in your bank account?
[181:28.59]I'm probably gonna have to do all these, right?
[181:43.02]Yeah, I've got to do every single one.
[181:50.48]That's more than everybody here.
[181:51.56]Yeah, there's like 3,000 people here.
[182:01.51]That's correct, right?
[182:03.57]I think so.
[182:04.79]You knew it was going to have to happen, right?
[182:13.34]Tax returns.
[182:24.75]Lookout.
[182:26.59]Oh, the plane went by?
[182:27.41]Yeah.
[182:28.65]Vegas, man.
[182:30.69]People are all over the place.
[182:36.71]I heard a cat outside yesterday.
[182:40.34]that it was like a weird, like high-pitched voice.
[182:42.86]And I was like, what the fuck?
[182:43.54]It was like, give me all your money.
[182:45.98]And I was like, what the fuck is this?
[182:48.48]It was high-pitched.
[182:49.06]And I want to say it was a cat holding somebody up on the street.
[182:52.72]It made no sense.
[182:53.42]And he had an eye patch.
[182:54.17]I was like, holy shit, we're in Vegas, man.
[183:02.43]Done.
[183:03.11]He had an iPad.
[183:08.53]Alright, that's it.
[183:14.42]That was just a Jay Leno joke.
[183:17.96]Yeah, it was.
[183:38.31]He probably made that already.
[183:45.31]Don't look at me.
[183:46.61]I'm not here.
[183:47.15]I got a cup though.
[183:48.69]You see that cup?
[183:50.25]Pretty deep.
[183:52.55]Alright, we're at step two of already step two.
[183:54.93]We're getting there.
[183:59.76]Why?
[184:00.06]Okay, this is fine.
[184:04.26]I need a place to put these when they're done.
[184:06.94]I can go right down there.
[184:08.24]I need a B and C.
[184:17.62]Why does Jerma always over emote?
[184:22.06]What?
[184:22.48]Over emote?
[184:23.08]What do you mean over emote?
[184:30.93]Overact?
[184:32.15]Over emote?
[184:32.65]I don't know what you mean over emote.
[184:40.03]Empty.
[184:41.95]And this... Laundry...
[184:46.52]This laundry dryer washer thing.
[184:50.92]Stopped over emoting.
[184:56.07]I didn't type anything in the chat at all.
[184:57.85]I would have been talking to you guys, but... You know.
[185:04.37]So this is, I'm going to assume, is part of the base of the wheel, right?
[185:12.04]Emo streamer wants to be Nightwing, but he's too fat.
[185:25.38]Alright, flip it around.
[185:26.64]All the folds, every single one, all the HDMI's have to come out.
[185:37.52]When is my collab with Critical?
[185:44.34]Right now.
[185:46.74]Welcome into the chat, guys.
[185:48.28]I have him on Discord here.
[185:49.84]Critical, say hello!
[186:06.89]Ready to call?
[186:09.71]You hear it, man?
[186:13.28]Ah, I must have had a scheduling conflict with him.
[186:14.80]I must have had a scheduling conflict with him.
[186:17.13]Shit, hello.
[186:32.93]uh no I was gonna hit him up actually I was going to hit him up very soon when am I gonna stream with logic rick morty and ninja that's all I gotta say about that is just oi
[187:04.53]Alright, so make sure I'm doing all this right.
[187:06.99]This tab has to come up.
[187:20.41]When are you going to collab with Jerma?
[187:23.13]No, that guy over emotes.
[187:24.27]I don't think I want to be in the same stream as him.
[187:27.96]He has like a really commanding presence.
[187:29.54]He like over talks and talks over everybody and...
[187:33.26]I don't, like, follow his humor that really at all, so... I mean, I like Jermo.
[187:44.72]Jermo's, like, not bad, but, like... It gets to the point being, like, do you have anything else besides, like... I'll try to do the voice.
[187:53.37]Like, don't have any cards like this.
[187:54.61]Like, he does it all the time.
[187:55.75]It's like, do you have any other tricks up your sleeve, dude?
[188:00.24]This is not meant to be, like, mean to him or anything.
[188:02.24]I think he's, like, cool.
[188:03.06]I think he's funny.
[188:08.46]I saw his Castle Gravestate video.
[188:10.76]I mean, that was pretty cool.
[188:15.07]I heard he pays for bots to view his channel, though.
[188:23.75]I'm going to go down that road.
[188:24.71]Alright, let's go.
[188:32.40]Unsubbing because you hate him.
[188:34.67]No, I don't hate him!
[188:35.35]He's like, cool, I like him.
[188:36.31]Like this.
[188:44.58]Am I gonna play Smash with Vinny?
[188:47.20]Fuck yeah, if he wants to.
[188:49.72]When Smash comes out, I'll play it with anybody.
[188:51.16]Because they're actually gonna have, uh... They'll have regional matchmaking, which is something that they've, like, never done before, so that's huge.
[189:06.04]Plus, you ever spend more than a couple days in somebody's dryer before?
[189:10.52]Not fun.
[189:13.06]I mean, I smelled real clean when I came out.
[189:15.00]I'll be honest with you.
[189:17.02]Every so often, it was weird because he would turn the dryer on.
[189:20.37]I was in there for probably 12 hours at a time.
[189:23.73]And he would turn the dryer on.
[189:25.79]And I'd be fucking flipping around and shit.
[189:27.35]And he would throw a couple sheets in there.
[189:29.33]And he'd be like, You smell pretty fresh, don't you?
[189:31.73]And I'd be like,
[189:32.57]Fuck, I guess I do.
[189:33.89]He'd throw hamburger meat in there and the heat from the dryer would actually cook it.
[189:39.85]So I would have to wait probably maybe 20 or 30 minutes for the raw hamburger meat to spin around with me until it was cooked enough where I could eat it.
[189:45.63]So I mean, he was nice enough.
[189:47.45]He like helped me out a little bit there.
[189:57.54]Both sides there, yeah.
[189:59.89]Same, oh I didn't, whoops.
[190:02.35]Fucked that up.
[190:18.38]Whole thing comes down here.
[190:22.66]Who's my smash man?
[190:23.44]It's Pac-Man.
[190:26.70]I mean I was gonna say Geno but,
[190:32.22]Whatever.
[190:34.28]Life sucks.
[190:35.36]Apparently.
[190:36.14]For Gino.
[190:40.88]Here we go.
[190:44.19]This comes down.
[190:47.91]Yeah, I was one of those people that thought the Grinch leak was real.
[190:52.25]And I was like, oh my god, this is gonna be the best game ever made!
[190:55.14]And then you gotta remember, it's... Everyone always is trying to fuck with you before a game comes out.
[191:00.51]Of course you did.
[191:01.11]Well, I mean, it looked really, it looked so real.
[191:04.15]There was so much backstory.
[191:06.17]So much time went into somebody making that leak that it was just like impossible for it to be fake.
[191:11.73]And here we are.
[191:12.57]Did I?
[191:24.26]Same thing on this side too.
[191:32.19]smash characters uh no but I mean pac-man it's always pac-man right pac-man's just always cool a couple other characters look interesting not to give spoilers or anything but there's a certain plant-based hero that looks really stupid kind of right up my alley
[192:01.66]Uh, okay, check the six little tabs we popped into the openings.
[192:04.18]If they haven't all popped into place, go back and fix them.
[192:06.12]I mean, these, this looks right.
[192:09.55]Spin around like this, and then we're gonna get this piece.
[192:21.38]Uh, it's gonna be a shit character.
[192:26.72]Well.
[192:28.05]We'll see what they do for DLC.
[192:29.97]Because they apparently already have a plan for DLC and it's, I guess, still, who else is left to put in that game?
[192:37.76]You know what I mean?
[192:41.04]They have every single Nintendo character ever.
[192:43.44]Has spirits and trophies and characters, like what the fuck?
[192:47.54]They have five more characters they wanna put in?
[192:58.38]Third party?
[193:00.34]Yeah, I mean, I'd be nice if one of those third party characters was... You know.
[193:08.31]Geno.
[193:08.59]Technically a third party character.
[193:11.19]Let's go across here.
[193:17.99]Carl Griffinsteed.
[193:19.95]If Nintendo ever hit me up to pay for the rights of Carl Griffinsteed... Oh, excuse me, Mr. Elbertson.
[193:26.03]Yes, I'm writing this email to offer you a lump sum of... I would reply to the email as fast as I could.
[193:32.79]I don't even care what the amount was.
[193:33.85]And I'd be like, yes, yes, yes!
[193:37.91]I'd be like, take it, take it now.
[193:39.21]Take it.
[193:39.41]How many bits is that?
[193:41.71]How much is that in bits?
[193:51.61]One dollar.
[193:52.27]It'll be worth it.
[193:53.49]Am I putting this in the right way?
[194:03.94]It's got a snap in there.
[194:11.03]Paid you in potato chips?
[194:12.05]It'd be worth it.
[194:12.79]I'd never have to buy them ever again.
[194:46.56]easy you should do a rumble of all the smash characters uh that's that's a lot it's a lot of characters steering wheel has a seat so we need to move that down here because that's done c and d again everything else from all of it the whole thing
[195:19.98]Did I lose it?
[195:20.60]Where did it just go?
[195:22.29]Where did that go?
[195:22.79]Oh, it's all the way down there.
[195:25.13]Fuck.
[195:25.79]Okay.
[195:42.34]And the two pieces down here.
[195:45.96]How's the elaborate pie box going?
[195:47.64]Actually, it's going pretty well.
[195:50.13]it's going pretty well what do you guys think you guys think it's going well so far a labo stream without alcohol what kind excuse me
[196:53.62]You were saying something, I think?
[197:04.59]Show the box.
[197:05.09]I showed the box earlier.
[197:05.91]It's a black box.
[197:08.67]It's pretty good.
[197:11.84]Is that sangria?
[197:12.56]No, it's a red blend.
[197:13.46]It's a California red blend from Black Box.
[197:16.74]Cheap, affordable, tastes great.
[197:25.81]what are you doing okay uh and then we need some room d the whole thing no just this left part oh put a sponsor warning in the title I'm not sponsored by black box I just bought it and like it
[197:56.02]That's it.
[198:04.65]Do you really even have to like it?
[198:09.68]Shill, shill.
[198:14.11]What, like you guys don't drink wine if you're above the age of 21?
[198:17.33]You've never had wine before in your life and you want a decent alternative to buying like a $50 bottle of wine and it's three liters in here and it's quality wine?
[198:30.34]Uh, funny story here.
[198:43.21]The guy that helps produce a lot of the video stuff and the guy that helped me make almost the whole rumble, we bought this and we wrote the whole rumble drink in the whole box of the black box wine.
[198:57.88]We also wrote four other skits and ideas completely drinking this wine.
[199:06.84]So it's kind of like a little... It's in my heart somewhere, you know?
[199:20.72]It's funny, Juice.
[199:21.90]Buy it up.
[199:24.10]The bits circled in the picture below shouldn't be folded.
[199:26.37]There's a reason they don't have fold lines.
[199:29.73]Okay, I didn't fold them.
[199:31.51]Maybe I did.
[199:32.15]Wait, what?
[199:32.51]Okay, well, apparently I do fold.
[199:48.18]Uh, I once, HoneyChain says, I once drank an entire bottle of wine and puked all over my friend's porch and then he powerbombed me through the sink.
[199:55.99]Well, I believe the first half, but the second half was sensationalized to make it seem like it was like, wow, it's crazy.
[200:01.16]I don't think the second part happened to you.
[200:02.38]I think you puked on your friend's sink and you, um, you know, you're trying to sensationalize it a little bit because...
[200:18.58]You calling him out?
[200:20.72]No.
[200:22.02]I believe him.
[200:25.92]You're the only one that's allowed to make things up?
[200:27.78]I'm the only one that's allowed to lie and make things up here.
[200:30.72]Don't you understand?
[200:40.26]One dollar.
[200:45.18]You sound presidential.
[200:48.42]Oh, fuck.
[200:50.56]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[200:51.48]Move on.
[201:03.30]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[201:06.36]Thank you.
[201:09.68]Okay, we're good.
[201:15.62]Now what?
[201:17.16]This folded down, I did.
[201:18.26]This one too, I did.
[201:19.92]I just heard my dog bark at me.
[201:28.35]Otto just said, like, hey, shut the fuck up.
[201:29.93]He's downstairs.
[201:32.49]These all come down.
[201:34.37]Those come all the way down.
[201:35.35]Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[201:36.29]These tabs come up.
[201:38.15]Like this.
[201:48.53]Like that, and then like that.
[201:52.09]Sick!
[201:55.40]That square is not going anywhere.
[201:56.84]Next, roll up the first loopy rectangular bit so that the tab comes down to the rest of the... I got him.
[202:07.23]I don't got it.
[202:10.71]Just to go in like that.
[202:14.31]Yes, it's not in there really securely though.
[202:17.56]You know what I mean?
[202:18.04]Like, fuck.
[202:19.96]You demand a ho-ho.
[202:21.83]So eat a ho-ho.
[202:23.13]Go to a convenience store.
[202:23.99]Get a fucking... Get a Yahoo, whatever they're called.
[202:28.45]The tab's poking out.
[202:30.37]Uh, this one is not.
[202:31.61]But that one is.
[202:32.39]Okay, they both know.
[202:41.92]No, that's fine.
[202:45.38]And this folds over...
[202:49.27]Put it back up again.
[202:50.35]And all this will be making you dizzy.
[202:51.45]Now roll the piece up from left until it looks like this.
[202:53.63]So that comes up.
[202:56.45]And then that comes over.
[202:59.45]And then the whole... That comes down.
[203:08.62]Shit.
[203:10.88]That.
[203:11.74]This.
[203:12.50]This way.
[203:14.06]And then this tab comes down into there.
[203:21.39]Oh, you little punk.
[203:22.31]Come on.
[203:30.27]Done?
[203:32.93]Remember, the bits weren't supposed to fold.
[203:35.43]Check that all four of them are still nice and straight.
[203:37.53]They are.
[203:39.43]They are.
[203:40.17]They are.
[203:40.70]They are.
[203:41.68]They are.
[203:49.34]That is straight.
[203:51.41]This one's a little fucked up.
[203:55.68]No, that's fine.
[203:57.54]Okay.
[203:58.90]You weigh the steering column.
[204:01.82]Next we'll attach the steering wheel to the steering column to make sure you've got the wheel close.
[204:05.79]I do.
[204:06.07]I do, it's right here.
[204:15.31]Fold the two colored flaps in the middle of the steering wheel down and out of the way.
[204:21.27]We'll be inserting the steering wheel column from above.
[204:22.98]Out of the way.
[204:28.22]Here comes the column.
[204:30.06]Straight down like this.
[204:36.98]Before you insert the steering wheel column, make sure it's facing the same way as on the screen.
[204:40.02]The printed bits on each side should match up.
[204:43.40]All the way down.
[205:01.34]I did it.
[205:01.62]Alright.
[205:03.60]Steering wheel and steering wheel column are done.
[205:05.10]Beautiful.
[205:05.58]It's done.
[205:06.00]The steering wheel is done.
[205:08.68]Now fit these two parts together.
[205:16.25]So lift the steering wheel part up and insert down to the base.
[205:21.07]It just sits down in there and that's it.
[205:24.53]What have you done?
[205:25.87]Okay.
[205:27.71]So just go down like that.
[205:37.50]There almost that almost felt like winning the crane game at an arcade.
[205:40.72]Where's our stuffed animal prize?
[205:45.24]Now we're going to turn the whole thing over The bits aren't all fixed together yet, so hold everything carefully to keep it in place Turn it upside down Right here, okay
[206:05.18]This here piece is called Captain Crunch.
[206:07.68]Captain Captain.
[206:09.85]He caps the steering column, then turns to keep it securely in place.
[206:14.11]What the fuck are you talking about?
[206:27.91]Alright, then that goes like that.
[206:33.65]Spin the captain around so that his two dents are facing a shot on screen, then slide him down on the end of the steering column.
[206:39.97]So, like this.
[206:41.35]Okay.
[206:54.22]Ahoy there, land lovers.
[206:55.20]This is the captain speaking.
[206:56.28]You'll want to hold... Now, why is this Garfield?
[206:59.90]I feel like this is like Garfield's Bits.
[207:02.82]I feel like I'm reading it at Garfield's Bits.
[207:05.79]Oh, there are land lovers.
[207:06.71]This is the captain speaking.
[207:07.93]You'll want to hold that wheel nice and steady when you turn me around.
[207:17.12]What do you want?
[207:17.68]Around I go till the cross lines up.
[207:30.22]Like this.
[207:39.68]Like that?
[207:40.10]That's it, right?
[207:51.09]They don't call me captain for nothing.
[207:52.51]You know, I wish I was part of the Toy-Con submarine, but a cardboard can dream.
[207:56.17]This is, Scarfield wrote all this.
[207:58.58]I'm convinced.
[208:05.25]Uh, Captain Capturn has four mates on deck.
[208:07.43]They're called Quadruple Lock Quadruplets.
[208:10.33]They help keep the captain in his place.
[208:13.75]So, flip them all around and fold them all in half.
[208:28.88]The one-time Garfield's not here.
[208:30.52]That's unfortunate.
[208:32.52]Everybody loves Garfield.
[208:34.27]Alright, so stick them in half, flip them in there, and stick them in the slots.
[208:46.20]First mate reporting for duty.
[208:47.34]My siblings and I were destined to do everything together.
[208:49.51]Quadruplet power!
[208:53.01]Slide the first mate down from above and lock her in.
[208:55.29]That's the first lock down.
[209:04.62]It's in.
[209:10.25]Do that to all four sides.
[209:12.55]Right?
[209:13.35]Yeah.
[209:14.41]I'm not reading this.
[209:16.47]Nice messages.
[209:18.13]Uh, fourth mate!
[209:18.75]They may spawn, but they're together.
[209:19.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[209:21.23]Okay.
[209:28.80]It's that one.
[209:35.07]Okay, one more.
[209:40.65]So that is locked in.
[209:44.25]You're missing out on Labo lore?
[209:46.18]Do you really care about Labo lore?
[209:48.36]You want me to go back?
[209:50.38]I ain't going back.
[209:51.88]Get ready to use these two stubby T-shaped pieces.
[209:55.86]They look a bit like sweaters.
[209:57.90]I only have one.
[209:59.92]Why do I only have one?
[210:03.31]No, I don't.
[210:03.83]Why?
[210:05.09]Alright, flip him up.
[210:06.35]Spin around.
[210:06.87]Okay.
[210:21.93]Let's attach the first sweater.
[210:23.29]Fold the arms so that they're ready for a hug, and then slide them into the openings in the steering wheel.
[210:30.61]That goes...
[210:33.58]Turn it back around you.
[210:39.22]Fucking idiot.
[210:40.56]Alright, right there.
[210:50.01]Like this?
[210:51.23]Yes.
[210:57.91]You need like little hands for this.
[211:03.55]That's in.
[211:07.08]Right?
[211:07.56]Looks good.
[211:15.36]Time for a second sweater.
[211:16.31]It gives the steering wheel a hug from the other side.
[211:18.13]It's a steering wheel sandwich on sweater bread.
[211:20.31]Carfield.
[211:22.41]Excuse me?
[211:23.95]Did you hear the dog?
[211:25.51]I'll go get him.
[211:31.97]I'm gonna go get my dog because he's probably being really annoying.
[211:35.72]He's probably being super annoying.
[211:39.38]Wait, how does this get in there?
[211:52.90]Otto is never annoying.
[211:53.91]No, I'm just kidding.
[211:55.59]He's my special little boy.
[211:57.75]So that's done.
[212:00.97]That's in.
[212:01.65]Secure.
[212:02.19]The steering part is now completely secured to the base.
[212:06.40]Let's check to make sure that everything moves like it should.
[212:08.48]This is where the Toy-Con key comes in.
[212:12.18]Oh, what if we have here?
[212:14.30]There's a hole that's the perfect size for the Toy-Con key to slide right through.
[212:17.64]I'm not gonna... We don't need the mode in there right now.
[212:27.07]So, this...
[212:30.64]goes like this.
[212:42.55]Perfect.
[212:44.17]Yes, it does.
[212:44.69]Try spinning the steering wheel around slowly.
[212:49.92]Does it go all the way around without stopping or catching?
[212:59.49]Yes, it does.
[213:05.52]Once you're done checking the steering wheel, remove the Toy-Con key for now.
[213:10.38]It might get caught a bit the first time, so make sure you remove it carefully.
[213:13.82]I got it.
[213:15.92]Somebody said other way.
[213:16.72]Yeah, that's good.
[213:20.61]It works.
[213:22.75]Alright, on to the next step.
[213:23.75]The steering wheel base is finished.
[213:25.33]The steering wheel is complete.
[213:27.83]This would be a great time for a break.
[213:29.75]We don't take breaks.
[213:30.66]Here.
[213:31.90]Three of seven.
[213:32.98]Making the engine compartment...
[213:37.40]Okay.
[213:39.36]I need to move this out of the way.
[213:40.76]Don't take any more drinks till you move this.
[213:50.44]Auto.
[213:50.70]One second.
[214:33.57]You have to be somewhere that's not right in the way.
[214:38.15]Okay.
[214:41.71]See, he doesn't wanna be in here, he's good.
[214:44.57]He's currently like back there, where the door is.
[214:47.21]Alright, so, we got this, I have it already, we're good.
[214:53.66]Make sure you get the special parts.
[214:57.58]Alright, number E.
[215:04.52]Oh, you're gonna land a blanket?
[215:05.44]What a good dog.
[215:10.48]A huge piece.
[215:11.78]Do I need the whole thing?
[215:13.78]Almost the whole thing.
[215:17.57]Jesus, this is huge.
[215:18.91]This looks like somebody's rib cage.
[215:24.03]It's like a Minecraft breastplate.
[215:30.48]Should I wear this?
[215:32.84]I'm gonna need this later, so...
[215:37.88]Okay.
[215:39.66]Show Otto.
[215:42.84]The cameras are like set in such specific... Can you see him?
[215:48.21]He's right there.
[215:50.53]See, right here.
[215:51.37]Otto.
[215:53.01]Hello, Otto.
[215:55.55]Hello, Mr. Otto.
[216:01.18]There, he's right there.
[216:01.96]Alright, so let me take out the little pieces that I need to punch out.
[216:09.30]We'll continue on our vehicle quest.
[216:11.38]I ripped it a little, but you know what?
[216:14.55]Who cares?
[216:18.15]That's it?
[216:19.33]No?
[216:19.45]Up here?
[216:24.52]Pet him.
[216:39.49]he's under the blanket there's a little blade he just like stuffed his body underneath it he's such a good dog he's the best dog ever alright so let's move this out of the way uh six seven eight nine it's like 10 o'clock eastern what what day is it
[217:07.93]It's Saturday night.
[217:09.81]We're good.
[217:10.37]It's not even 10 o'clock.
[217:12.81]Alright, so... Get it out there.
[217:17.07]The engine compartment comes from the... What's wrong with me?
[217:21.69]Okay, it doesn't really have an engine on it, but it's fun to pretend.
[217:28.11]Bulbs.
[217:33.94]Pretty much all of them.
[217:37.97]All the ones at the top, all the ones in the middle.
[217:40.61]Every single little piece, all of it has to be folded.
[217:46.20]Every single piece.
[217:47.90]Okay.
[217:49.42]Let's begin.
[217:57.52]What kind of dog is Otto?
[217:58.40]He's a Dachshund mix.
[218:00.66]I don't know what he is mixed with, but there's been plenty of guesses over the years.
[218:07.73]Chihuahua, Beagle, Rottweiler, Jack Russell Terrier.
[218:12.19]Don't know, because he's a rescue, so I don't really know.
[218:14.51]I have no idea.
[218:15.17]There's been plenty of guesses.
[218:21.44]He's a tiny boy.
[218:22.96]He's actually kind of big for a Dachshund.
[218:29.43]But he is a very good dog.
[218:33.57]It's an old classic Jerma question.
[218:36.89]What kind of dog do you have?
[218:39.29]Yeah, I mean, he's... I don't know.
[218:41.81]Thought about doing one of those doggy DNA tests, but I've read a lot of things about how those things are bullshit, and they just send you back a random DNA test that doesn't even mean anything.
[218:52.16]I don't know how true that is.
[218:57.16]It might be true, it might not be.
[219:10.56]Do your own DNA test.
[219:23.19]What?
[219:23.91]12% ferret.
[219:25.71]He might have some ferret in him.
[219:26.79]Fold, fold.
[219:33.23]Right in the middle.
[219:37.68]We got one.
[219:39.69]I guess we have two here one two your dog is a purebred rat well then I'm sorry to tell you this but he's not a dog your dog is a rat it's not it's not a dog
[220:11.46]Looks good.
[220:12.24]It's such a fucking mess over here.
[220:20.65]Alright, so.
[220:26.43]Done, done.
[220:27.91]One more piece.
[220:28.59]So many little pieces in this big boy here.
[220:31.67]Should I, ever thought of getting a pet rat?
[220:38.80]I have over the years.
[220:40.88]My one issue with the pet rat is they're wonderful, they're really intelligent, they're super sweet, they're really fun, they're really smart.
[220:49.46]But, man, they really only live like a year.
[220:52.93]They live like two years.
[220:53.89]I get so attached to any animal that I ever have.
[220:57.85]I used to have hamsters and gerbils and all that shit, and it was so tough after fucking a year of...
[221:07.36]a year and a half would go by and it was like right when you're beginning to start a relationship and like, oh, this is my animal, my pet.
[221:15.23]It just sucks.
[221:17.09]But they are really good pets.
[221:18.21]They're really fun to be around.
[221:19.57]They're really energetic.
[221:20.95]They're really funny.
[221:24.81]But just unfortunately, they don't live very long.
[221:39.20]So I'll fold this in.
[221:40.64]This big piece comes up and goes in here.
[221:43.91]I can handle it.
[222:12.06]God damn it, he actually jebaited the Labo string.
[222:17.30]Yes, I did.
[222:18.42]I did, you're right.
[222:20.71]I did do that.
[222:25.53]Alright, we need... It's time to introduce the eyelet.
[222:29.97]It's got two parts, the bit on the left is the grommet and the washer, so we have, how many of these do we have?
[222:34.30]Do we need one or two?
[222:35.22]How many do we need?
[222:36.92]Take one of the gray eyelets from the bag.
[222:48.92]Get over here.
[222:49.46]Get over here.
[222:49.98]Get over here.
[222:50.46]Get over here.
[222:50.97]Get over here.
[222:58.03]I don't want to take everything out.
[222:59.85]Just give me a grommet.
[223:03.23]Give me a grommet.
[223:05.10]Give me a grommet.
[223:15.46]We forgot the crackers?
[223:19.80]What do you mean with what crackers?
[223:22.72]The heck do you mean, man?
[223:24.88]Fuck do you mean?
[223:25.34]Alright.
[223:26.92]Oh, take the grommet and push it into the hole from the outside.
[223:30.40]So on the back of our easy bake oven, this thing here.
[223:34.28]So it goes through here.
[223:47.10]So this snaps on through here.
[223:50.09]Yes it does.
[223:50.71]That's the way it goes, right?
[223:59.23]Snap the washer onto the grommet from the inside and it'll make a snap.
[224:06.00]Tell me if you hear it.
[224:26.11]Nice, okay, good.
[224:30.86]We need an adult.
[224:34.24]What's the point of that?
[224:36.18]Okay!
[224:52.07]Sheet F.
[225:02.81]Just as good as the first set.
[225:12.02]All of it except for the bottom part.
[225:15.06]You guys having a good time?
[225:16.06]You having fun?
[225:19.30]You guys having fun?
[225:28.41]I've seen some nos here.
[225:32.90]I'm seeing some no's here.
[225:33.76]I'm gonna have to eat paint on stream.
[225:35.64]You know what I mean?
[225:36.08]Like, I'm seeing some no's.
[225:44.28]What do I do with this?
[225:44.92]What do I do with my, like, fucking airline puke box?
[225:50.74]I'm running out of space.
[225:55.39]Don't turn this piece.
[225:56.15]Don't, don't, don't, don't do it.
[226:00.37]Fold these flops first.
[226:12.78]Go say hello to Etalyx.
[226:14.97]Just tell me if you can hear this on his stream.
[226:46.06]Watch out, I don't wanna hit you with the door.
[226:50.12]You're in a bad spot, I don't wanna hit you with the door.
[226:51.70]Did you hear me?
[227:04.20]He has like the sweetest face right now, I have to show him.
[227:11.23]Look up here.
[227:20.96]Can you see here?
[227:21.58]No, you can't.
[227:28.15]Move camera?
[227:29.09]I can't move the camera.
[227:30.21]It's like in the worst possible moment.
[227:31.97]Maybe I can.
[227:32.57]Hey, watch out.
[227:43.93]Hey, watch out.
[227:47.09]What are you doing?
[227:56.22]He's so cute He's my special boy Which you guys couldn't hear me I made like a bird noise.
[228:13.35]Oh, well, I mean that but that means that we have good sound dampening.
[228:15.97]That's good.
[228:16.33]I
[228:24.85]Is this in a good spot?
[228:29.65]Right here is good.
[228:32.41]Right there.
[228:33.33]That's alright.
[228:39.74]We might have heard you.
[228:40.46]We thought it was an auto.
[228:43.08]No, I went like... Pretty loud out there.
[228:49.97]You're supposed to watch Etalyx' stream and see if you heard it.
[228:57.35]Alright, so wait, but don't fold these yet.
[228:59.09]Fold them back.
[228:59.71]Now, when you're freezing the big fold, be careful not to fold this little mushroomy part.
[229:17.03]Alright.
[229:20.57]Don't fold the mushroomy part.
[229:34.70]Trevor Smug, new emote.
[229:42.71]Fold it all up.
[229:47.89]Left, right, up, down.
[229:49.85]Fold it in here.
[229:50.55]This comes up.
[229:56.02]Ooh, careful.
[229:58.74]It's a weird swing that that does all the way across.
[230:03.87]And that folds up and then goes into the little tab that's down there.
[230:06.88]Do you see it?
[230:07.70]Do you see it, folks?
[230:13.68]That.
[230:16.54]No, I don't.
[230:21.78]Something on this side.
[230:22.60]Watch out for the little mushroom.
[230:37.76]I did such a good job.
[230:38.78]Okay, now turn the whole piece to its front and check to make sure that the ends of both tabs are sticking to the other side.
[230:59.08]They are, they are.
[231:03.26]Okay, they are.
[231:05.61]Although this one's a little torn.
[231:08.88]No, they are.
[231:10.36]Looks fine.
[231:14.28]Congratulatory wine chug?
[231:17.02]I agree to that.
[231:31.99]That piece is done for now.
[231:32.69]We'll eat it again soon.
[231:33.35]What soon isn't soon enough.
[231:36.03]Be patient.
[231:47.80]Oh, this piece.
[231:50.04]That was the weakest chug in the world.
[231:54.42]Okay.
[232:13.11]I can't spit this out.
[232:30.43]Okay.
[232:32.81]Nevermind.
[232:46.41]Hey, great job.
[233:10.90]Do I fold those?
[233:12.76]I don't know.
[233:13.20]I didn't let the video game tell me.
[233:15.22]Watch out!
[233:18.10]This piece has a bit in the middle that you definitely shouldn't fold.
[233:20.47]Try to keep that in mind when you're folding the other bits.
[233:25.79]I won't.
[233:31.37]Alright, fold this like that.
[233:34.74]Looks good.
[233:37.00]Armpit sweat.
[233:47.28]Give me a break.
[233:48.08]It's... It's been four hours.
[233:50.58]It's been four hours.
[233:51.58]I've been drinking wine.
[233:52.49]It could be much worse.
[233:59.03]Let me tell you.
[234:02.93]I'm fine.
[234:03.81]It's just perspiration.
[234:05.19]I'm wearing a long-sleeved shirt.
[234:06.48]I'm in Las Vegas.
[234:08.34]You know how hot it is here?
[234:09.24]It's like 42 degrees out right now.
[234:11.22]It gets cold in the winter.
[234:13.04]Alright, fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it.
[234:25.68]It's fucking cold out right now.
[234:27.94]Vegas is fucking chilly.
[234:30.88]As... Like the kids say, as fuck.
[234:33.18]You know what I mean?
[234:39.33]Do I not fold this?
[234:40.71]Hold on.
[234:52.05]Oh, I gotta... Chugging wine is like...
[234:56.15]Nobody did that besides Bacchus.
[235:00.30]Nobody chugs wine except for Bacchus.
[235:02.74]He's the only person in history to ever do it.
[235:04.40]Alright.
[235:08.60]Do I fold this one down?
[235:14.90]I don't think I fold that one.
[235:16.06]I don't think I did the top one down.
[235:24.69]So this goes, oh man.
[235:26.11]That's a hard blink.
[235:46.64]Why don't you do webcam?
[235:50.52]Why don't you do webcam?
[235:51.76]How come you never do face cam?
[235:54.16]That was a hard blink.
[235:57.68]Okay.
[236:08.70]A soft blink is, a hard blink is like, I'm lost.
[236:13.88]That comes down.
[236:21.17]I didn't do it, it's fine.
[236:26.04]What if I faint on stream?
[236:27.64]Why would I faint on stream?
[236:33.32]Did I miss a tab?
[236:38.58]No, that's correct, right?
[236:39.60]I got it.
[236:41.80]We'll insert it into the part we finished just before this one.
[236:44.02]Fold the flap at the bottom of the long gap here down and out of the way.
[236:50.45]What does it want me to do?
[236:51.65]Fold the gap out of the way.
[236:53.21]You just said it.
[236:53.93]Where is it?
[237:02.32]That goes down.
[237:04.48]Look over at the screen, make sure that the part is facing the right direction, then insert as far as it'll go.
[237:08.04]Okay, so it kind of goes in like this first.
[237:15.92]It's like a D battery.
[237:21.57]I didn't even fucking need the tutorial.
[237:26.51]That's fine, that works.
[237:29.76]Now that's done, stand the piece up.
[237:31.88]Hey, it doesn't look a bit like a koala's face.
[237:42.89]I mean, it does.
[237:48.81]Okay.
[237:49.51]Is the piece facing the same way as on screen?
[237:51.17]It'll be tricky to fix later if you get it wrong.
[237:53.21]Double check.
[238:04.54]I got it, right?
[238:05.56]Yeah.
[238:10.60]Everything looks good.
[238:11.48]Let's lock it securely in place with this piece here.
[238:13.24]A long lost cousin of the quadruped.
[238:14.92]I don't want to hear the fucking whole thing.
[238:17.16]Turn it over and fold it in two.
[238:18.22]Now it's ready to be locked.
[238:19.24]Lock, lock, lock.
[238:20.26]Lock, lock it.
[238:20.98]Here's a lock.
[238:21.64]Lock the thing.
[238:22.32]Okay, great.
[238:25.10]How did I chug that fucking line?
[238:26.72]I was going slow.
[238:41.23]I did it, I think.
[238:42.11]Hold on, give me a BRB for one second.
[240:03.34]That was deer in headlights.
[240:04.54]I fucking hate face cams.
[240:11.00]I wasn't ready for it and I pressed it.
[240:20.89]I get embarrassed real easily.
[240:22.29]Alright, here we go.
[240:35.22]Alright, here, look, it's a koala.
[240:36.92]Go ahead, Nintendo.
[240:40.96]Ta-da, it's all done.
[240:42.00]I did it.
[240:42.98]I finished the whole thing on stream.
[240:44.24]It's over.
[240:46.26]Where's that?
[240:55.57]Alright, get in there.
[240:59.41]Stop it.
[241:04.46]Okay.
[241:06.20]So, here we go.
[241:10.12]Fold it up.
[241:12.52]And get it in there, like this.
[241:18.09]Why is that off?
[241:19.59]Why is this turned off?
[241:23.73]Pizza.
[241:36.22]The battery's dead.
[241:55.79]That's better.
[242:03.90]Don't throw your phone behind you.
[242:07.30]Here.
[242:10.42]It was fucking dark in here.
[242:11.54]I was like, what the hell?
[242:13.32]I was like, what the hell?
[242:15.48]Okay, so that matches up with here.
[242:17.94]Just so you guys can see.
[242:22.84]See what I'm talking about?
[242:23.48]Alright, so the tabs need to, this comes down.
[242:42.51]Whoa, that... I get the other one quick.
[242:45.45]Was it right?
[242:45.89]Is that correct?
[242:46.39]I hope it's correct.
[242:47.89]It is.

[266:24.41]I'm excited to see them.
[266:25.37]Okay.
[266:43.18]I can't get anybody.
[266:44.48]I can't get a goddamn person on my side.
[266:46.91]Oh, that was critical.
[266:50.83]He's a fucking swell boy.
[266:55.02]What am I doing?
[267:17.65]Jerma is on a mildly drunken tirade to tell people- to show people that dogs have a different smell when they sleep.
[267:24.39]Alright, you can tell him that he can smell my asshole.
[267:42.28]So we're almost done with the engine.
[267:46.45]Getting close.
[267:48.67]Getting close to the engine being done.
[267:58.47]I'm doing more Adam Sandler.
[267:59.63]I can't.
[268:06.78]What does Star have to say?
[268:07.62]Where's Star?

[268:57.01]Charlie just called me thin skin?
[268:59.17]You don't say that shit to me.
[269:13.34]Well, tell him I'm fucking busy building a lab ball.
[269:20.05]I missed it.
[269:22.89]Streamer battle?
[269:23.93]Fine.
[269:29.12]Ask him if he can do that.
[269:30.70]Can Charlie do that?
[269:31.92]Can Charlie do this?
[269:35.05]Didn't think so.
[269:41.35]Careful.
[269:56.52]I'm dying.
[269:58.34]I'm not dying.
[269:59.07]I'm fine.
[270:01.01]Can't even get a streamer to back me up.
[270:04.17]Where's RT?
[270:07.38]I don't need the headphones.
[270:08.92]Is RT still here?
[270:11.12]RT game crowd?
[270:34.53]He's down for the challenge.
[270:35.69]Critical's down for the challenge.
[270:37.08]There's no challenge.
[270:38.32]I'm not challenging anybody.
[270:39.58]I was just going like this.
[270:47.88]In quotes, you better watch out for this.
[270:54.92]He's destroying me.
[270:55.88]No, he's not.
[270:56.54]Get that fuck out of here.
[270:58.66]Look at those headphones.
[271:01.76]He threw cards at me?
[271:03.00]Cards?
[271:07.76]What's he saying?
[271:09.18]Give me a clip.
[271:12.40]On people that dogs have a different smell when they sleep.
[271:15.33]Alright, you can tell him that he can smell my ass.
[271:19.29]That's the same one.
[271:22.07]What am I getting challenged to?
[271:24.63]Jerma wants to know if I can karate chop my hand.
[271:27.36]Like what, some type of fucking outraged child going through an episode?
[271:31.76]I can do something so much better, Jerma.
[271:33.70]Here, you tell Jerma this.
[271:35.14]If he wants to throw down...
[271:37.20]I'll fucking hit him with these playing cards.
[271:40.22]Gambit style.
[271:42.33]Oh, fuck.

[271:48.07]You see this, Jerma?
[271:50.03]Huh?
[271:53.95]I'm not dealing with an amateur here.
[272:01.73]Thought I was dealing with an amateur for a second.
[272:06.72]It's fine, Charlie.
[272:07.32]I'll get you to this.
[272:24.44]You couldn't even tell how fast that was.
[273:03.35]I was so fat, I couldn't even tell.
[273:05.97]That kick may have been 2000 miles per hour.
[273:08.91]I would just be careful.
[273:10.98]I gotta be careful every time I do that.

[275:58.10]I didn't invade anybody.

[280:31.81]Charlie, let me... Ah, fuck, I need to grab my pants.
[280:49.27]I'm muted?
[280:50.71]No, I'm fine.

[281:20.43]I was getting a drink, but I've been stopped at the door.
[281:25.27]Did you come in here for a reason?
[281:53.65]Spoiler advance.
[281:54.53]Did we win it?
[282:01.56]Why am I sending people to other streams?
[282:03.54]I don't give a shit.
[282:06.19]I just dropped one.
[282:11.17]I broke my fucking desk.
[282:28.94]Look, if you want to watch somebody, I love that you want to support other streamers.
[282:35.96]Watch Charlie.
[282:36.69]He's good.
[282:38.37]Metallic's good.
[282:40.31]Star.
[282:42.21]Don't watch him.
[282:43.75]It's not that good.
[282:45.59]It's pretty bad.
[282:48.03]He's not good.
[282:51.15]Vinny.
[282:51.91]Yes!
[282:53.35]Vinny's a fucking talented guy.
[282:56.62]Star.
[282:57.78]Ugh!
[283:14.73]To be completely all complete honesty though Stars a great guy don't think otherwise ever for any reason for real Okay, let's go
[283:32.90]The Etalyx is not talking shit.
[283:35.82]Whatever.
[283:45.93]That's in.
[283:46.39]I told you I had to drink to play these games.
[283:56.89]Labo especially.
[284:00.44]What the fuck did he say?
[284:02.86]Wait, wait, this is important.
[284:04.66]I will go off.
[284:07.79]I don't know where the fucking headphones are.
[284:09.83]What is this clip?
[284:13.13]Where are my headphones?
[284:15.27]Where are my headphones?
[284:20.13]Oh, shit.
[284:20.97]That's an Xbox controller.
[284:22.17]Fuck it.
[284:22.47]Who cares?
[284:22.89]Xbox sucks.
[284:28.14]What is this clip?
[284:40.63]Look at this tiny table.
[284:50.69]That's like the little wood table from the living room.
[284:55.20]Is that what he's trying to build the lab bowl on?
[284:59.93]Yes.
[285:03.56]Yes.
[285:04.40]Yes, I am.
[285:13.51]Whatever.
[285:14.81]It's so small.
[285:17.85]We talked about it before I started streaming.
[285:19.39]It was like, I don't know where the fuck am I going to build this?
[285:33.45]This is what Joel said?
[285:34.67]What did Joel say?
[285:38.37]Another incredibly talented fucking live streamer.
[285:49.20]Thanks for letting me know.
[285:50.24]I really appreciate hearing about Jerma, but could you chill out?
[285:54.60]Thank you.
[286:09.20]Joel got, like, mad.
[286:11.14]Don't fuck, don't fuck with people if they don't want it.
[286:15.06]He's a fucking funny, like, really good streamer.
[286:18.05]Don't, like, make him pissed off.
[286:24.23]Like, don't, like, harass other people.
[286:27.69]If they're, like, Charlie's into it, Etalyx is into it, like, if they're not, just leave him alone.
[286:34.80]He's, he doesn't, like, know what the fuck is going on.
[286:40.03]Ah, Joel's angry.
[286:43.51]No, he sees it.
[286:44.34]It's fine.
[286:44.78]He's fine.
[286:47.58]But don't just spam other people.
[286:51.22]Please.
[286:53.72]Oh, the me and Charlie and me and Etalyx.
[286:55.92]Yeah, that's definitely like for fun and everything, but...
[287:00.06]If Joel is trying to run a stream don't like don't fuck with him.
[287:03.06]It doesn't deserve it He's fucking a great guy.
[287:06.04]So yes, they probably know I do what's going on But I have no idea what's going on here So Charlie and Etalyx aren't great guys, that's not what I said I
[287:29.32]Just don't go after some random person.
[287:32.88]I'm having fun, you're having fun.
[287:36.34]Charlie's having a lot of fun.
[287:37.74]Charlie's having a lot of fun.
[287:40.54]But Joel had nothing to do with this at all.
[287:44.83]He's just trying to run his broadcast.
[287:46.59]Don't fuck with him, you know what I mean?
[287:53.03]Where are we, here?
[288:02.53]No, I have a lot of respect for Joel.
[288:04.19]Like, please don't get me wrong here.

[293:47.91]I will reiterate this one more time.
[293:49.94]Our fun does not need to bleed into somebody else's stream.
[293:54.50]Let them do what they want to do, right?
[294:01.46]Where's the other half?
[294:11.14]There it is.
[294:15.21]Can you re- I don't have any fun.
[294:16.39]Can you rewind?

[294:41.65]This moves over here.
[294:46.88]Internet sucks.
[294:48.56]It's been pretty stable I think for a while now at least.
[294:55.85]Let's go!
[294:58.01]I'm gonna piss my pants though for real.
[295:11.26]I'm gonna go pee.
[295:13.10]I'll be back in like two minutes!
[295:31.38]Ehh?
[297:13.48]Hello?
[297:18.26]That needs to come back.
[297:22.84]Okay.
[297:26.28]Alright, so we've got these pieces now.
[297:37.85]It was actually two minutes?
[297:39.51]I know, right?
[297:41.39]Pretty good.
[297:45.27]I gotta get all this shit out of here.
[297:46.43]There's so many little knobs.
[298:18.10]Why won't you come out?
[298:20.30]What are you doing?
[298:21.50]Why?
[298:22.06]It's broken!
[298:26.38]Relax, Jeremy.
[298:27.22]You're fine.
[298:30.00]I'm so fucking goddamn invested in this labo.
[298:33.54]Me too.
[298:34.88]It was 80 bucks.
[298:36.52]So I better be.
[298:38.36]So expensive.
[298:56.08]80 bucks for cardboard yeah yeah you're right yeah yeah alright we've got now they're good scuffed labo
[299:33.17]Alright, so this rolls over.
[299:35.03]It's a roll roll and then this comes down and these pieces go in.
[299:43.18]Damn.
[299:45.22]This is tight.
[299:59.09]I spent money on this.
[300:01.13]Yeah.
[300:11.57]Where does this go?
[300:12.49]What?
[300:12.71]This goes across.
[300:20.26]Like that?
[300:22.04]Like that's it.
[300:23.54]Okay.
[300:29.62]I folded this, that was a mistake apparently.
[300:33.36]That's okay, it looks fine.
[300:39.02]You spent 80 and made a thousand.
[300:49.34]I can't fucking believe it.
[300:51.52]People are so generous, I don't even understand.
[300:56.20]Just wait until the green screen stream, maybe that'll be worth money.
[300:58.76]Alright, don't fold these, fold this.
[301:08.87]Damn.
[301:19.96]This part down.
[301:21.92]Ugh, that kind of crunches.
[301:29.14]You know, I can sound like a broken record all I want, but if you don't think this stream is worth paying for, don't pay for it.
[301:40.96]If you're like, no, this ain't worth fucking $5 a month, don't do it.
[301:46.28]I respect it.
[301:49.16]Let's go.
[302:02.63]How do you pirate the stream?
[302:05.35]You just... You just open it.
[302:12.28]Same deal, fold it up.
[302:14.28]Put it together.
[302:16.28]Slot into slot.
[302:20.30]I will never have a sub goal for you guys.
[302:22.60]I'll never have a bit goal.
[302:23.88]I'll never tell you guys you need to pay money.
[302:25.52]I'll never tell you guys I need you to pay me.
[302:28.72]If you think it was worth it, that's a decision that you need to make.
[302:31.90]I'm not going to make it for you.
[302:53.23]You wouldn't pirate a stream.
[302:54.99]Alright, this thing needs to flip around.
[303:03.74]More merchandise.
[303:04.56]I talked about it before.
[303:05.40]There'll be two t-shirts that will be available to purchase for the first time since 2014.
[303:11.26]The Glue Man shirt will be coming back.
[303:14.10]As well as a planet shirt.
[303:17.51]A solar system shirt will be available as well.
[303:20.01]It'll be a new shirt.
[303:22.51]If you want it, it'll be $20.
[303:24.59]It'll never be more than that, ever.
[303:26.93]I will never charge more than $20 for a shirt for any fucking circumstance, literally ever.
[303:34.76]And that's the way it is.
[303:35.94]It'll be there probably in December.
[303:37.88]Probably around Christmas time.
[303:43.79]What about inflation?
[303:46.41]Whatever.
[303:55.15]that's a little nub damn what about tax uh that's why I want to make it 20 only flip it around flip it all up yeah yeah it looks good uh it'll be on teespring if you're curious
[304:20.07]I got business smarts releasing during Christmas.
[304:22.19]Well, I figured it's a... I did it like three years ago at the same time, so... Can I pay you in cardboard?
[304:33.11]No, unfortunately no.
[304:37.29]Get the first straw ready to go.
[304:38.75]Big ol' robot hug.
[304:39.69]The straw line should face like you see on the screen.
[304:41.65]Like this.
[304:43.99]Like that.
[304:47.07]Not down.
[304:54.25]So this goes straight through this slot here.
[304:58.07]Okay, then what?
[305:06.16]All the way?
[305:06.64]Okay, you told me to do it.
[305:12.56]Put the shirts on the EU site as well.
[305:16.04]That's why I will never have a shirt more than $20.
[305:19.61]Because it's crazy to ship internationally
[305:24.94]So if a shirt is like 30 bucks, you're getting fucking screwed during the shipping process.
[305:31.52]So those of you that are EU, a shirt will never be more than $20.
[305:35.77]So if you get fucked in shipping, it's not gonna be super, super terrible.
[305:44.85]Okay, it's in the right spot.
[305:45.97]Here it is.
[305:49.05]So this has to, wait, wait, wait.
[305:50.55]This comes up and around like this.
[305:57.38]This goes down and in?
[305:58.54]Damn.
[305:59.46]Okay.
[306:09.37]Different diapers?
[306:11.67]I don't think this would sell very well.
[306:16.41]Crossing down.
[306:16.97]Mine looks fucked up.
[306:25.25]No, I have the opinion of if you were to go to any store and buy like a Star Wars shirt, which is arguably, and arguably this is just for real, that shit is, that franchise is worth like hundreds of millions of dollars.
[306:45.15]And those t-shirts are like 15 bucks.
[306:48.90]Me selling a Jerma985 shirt for like $32,
[306:55.15]No.
[306:55.65]No fucking way.
[307:00.51]Not even close.
[307:04.21]Alright, that looks good.
[307:04.93]Alright.
[307:09.24]You'd buy it for $40.
[307:10.34]Well, even if you would, I don't care.
[307:12.56]I'm not selling a shirt for more than fucking $20, ever.
[307:16.96]That's a huge amount of money.
[307:17.92]$50 from Swiggity Swanky.
[307:22.54]I just got back from a long day at work and had to walk an extra three miles home after my car died.
[307:31.36]And now I find you doing this.
[307:34.12]You're my favorite streamer on Twitch.
[307:36.82]I hope you got your car situation taken care of because that sucks.
[307:40.79]Holy shit, dude.
[307:41.89]Swiggy Swaggy, thanks for the 50 fucking dollars, man.
[307:47.31]It's a lot of money.
[307:49.67]Thank you.
[307:51.43]Hopefully your car is alright.
[307:54.58]We're building a car right now.
[307:57.22]Maybe you can use it.
[308:02.00]Thank you so much, dude.
[308:03.72]50 fucking bucks and you're having car trouble.
[308:05.74]Please help me take care of yourself first.
[308:09.08]Because that's a lot of money.
[308:12.32]But... Yeah.
[308:17.64]I don't just do merch for no reason.
[308:22.16]If it's fun, if it makes sense, sure.
[308:24.94]Alright, you thought you were done?
[308:33.31]Flip this piece over.
[308:34.97]Which one?
[308:36.87]Hold it.
[308:43.34]But multi-billion dollar companies have an advantage of market penetration and worth and width.
[308:48.33]Economist status quo does not equate with real or perceived value, and any economist that tells you otherwise can't see that... You're blowing my brain here.
[308:58.66]Okay, the nubs are in.
[309:15.23]No, I think $20, $25 is asking a lot.
[309:17.58]It's a lot of money.
[309:18.18]$25 for a t-shirt?
[309:22.72]That's the kind of money you spend on... Like a band t-shirt.
[309:30.11]Am I like as popular as a band?
[309:33.67]No, I mean, I don't think so.
[309:38.09]On drugs!
[309:40.72]That's good.
[309:44.96]This piece has to fold this way.
[309:52.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[309:52.93]Spin it so the hole is up this way?
[309:58.55]Why is it telling me to do that now?
[309:59.71]This is gonna break.
[310:09.30]What?
[310:09.52]Alright, that's it.
[310:19.93]That's good.
[310:26.35]Locked in.
[310:28.43]The first straw has been powered up.
[310:30.69]Good, that's great.
[310:36.50]Am I making Thor's hammer?
[310:38.62]I wish.
[310:44.94]You have more subs than Matt Keefy from the band Trivium, who's also a streamer.
[310:51.60]Yeah, but why, if that was the case, then why would I want to tell people to spend a shitload of money on me?
[310:56.44]You know what I mean?
[310:58.89]If there are people that are spending $5 a month on this stream already.
[311:03.31]Hey, oh, I got a t-shirt.
[311:04.67]It's 32 bucks.
[311:07.50]Bullshit.
[311:09.18]I don't believe it.
[311:21.39]Why did you pay more for Jerma Expensive?
[311:24.75]I don't know.
[311:32.31]Yeah, they all get folded.
[311:33.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[311:37.90]$20 is good for a t-shirt.
[311:39.24]I agree, and it'll never change.
[311:42.14]If you ever see a t-shirt on this channel that's more than $20, link this clip.
[311:51.27]And tell me to go fuck myself.
[311:57.57]For real.
[312:03.93]Alright.
[312:05.43]Does that include shipping?
[312:06.31]It does not.
[312:07.33]Unfortunately.
[312:07.87]I'm sorry.
[312:17.03]Same deal.
[312:17.65]This goes like this.
[312:24.35]Rapid inflation?
[312:25.79]It's not that rapid.
[312:29.17]Straight through.
[312:33.57]Did he comment on it at all?
[312:35.49]Comment on what?
[312:39.36]Did I comment on what?
[312:40.30]What are you asking?
[312:48.46]Did I comment on what?
[313:07.93]Hyperinflation.
[313:09.33]Whatever.
[313:09.65]Wait, do I have this right?
[313:19.82]I do.
[313:20.08]It comes in like this, like that.
[313:23.42]Okay.
[313:31.05]Death Grips is an anime podcast.
[313:34.01]Well, that would have got me maybe like a year ago, but I know what Death Grips is.
[313:37.39]Although I don't really listen to their music.
[313:40.25]I haven't really listened very much.
[313:50.87]That's good.
[314:00.38]Up and around, and we are closed.
[314:03.32]Done.
[314:05.37]So why is this one different than this one?
[314:21.78]But the shirt that you are talking about is a planet shirt.
[314:27.28]It'll be like right here.
[314:32.85]All the planets, or at least most of them.
[314:34.69]The ones people care about.
[314:38.21]Should be fun.
[314:49.60]A limited number?
[314:50.66]No, there's no limited number of shirts.
[314:53.58]It'll be available for about a month?
[314:56.08]Oh, shit.
[315:00.18]Uh-oh.
[315:05.62]Uh, this is a real, uh oh.

[316:42.71]No, that's not good.
[316:45.17]That's not good.
[316:52.27]It needs to be like this, but shit.
[316:59.19]Like that.
[317:02.39]Okay, that's good.
[317:06.33]The white blip needs to be up.

[380:17.93]Does your knot look the same?
[380:20.46]It's a little long, but it will get the job done.
[380:26.28]Cryo pre-recorded.
[380:35.73]Crying will make you feel better.
[380:43.14]Wrap it around.
[380:48.64]Oh.
[380:55.05]Alright, leave it.
[381:01.05]I've got the hiccups now.
[381:05.89]Oh, I got the fucking hiccups.

[381:25.33]He's trying to hold back the tears.
[381:31.95]Seven years ago when I made my first YouTube video.
[381:36.52]Never in a million fucking years did I think I'd be sitting down in Las Vegas with a ton of fucking supporters just giving me fucking money.
[381:52.31]Never in a million years.
[381:59.63]Ever.
[382:09.58]He's getting reversed cyberbullied.
[382:15.89]I got a free vibe this video.
[382:22.65]Well, if you never think it's worth doing, don't up your subscription.
[382:25.71]I've said that before and I'll say it again.
[382:29.90]If you watch, and over time, over months, or six months, two months, three months, one month, and you're like, I don't care anymore.
[382:37.94]This is not fucking fun anymore.
[382:40.38]Do not pay me any more money.
[382:42.17]Because I wouldn't deserve it at that point.
[382:43.79]Bye.
[383:07.34]That's it, right?
[383:09.18]What's next?
[383:18.66]I got two of these, right?

[383:20.40]Yeah?
[383:20.66]Yeah?
[383:25.72]Uh, thank you ButterDirt for the $15.
[383:27.06]I don't leave your stream saying that was fun.
[383:29.80]I leave your stream saying no, please don't leave.
[383:32.67]It's a unique feeling nothing else has ever replicated.
[383:47.54]Thank you.
[383:49.12]Also, NK Source says, I like that you hold, you like that you, us hold you accountable for making quality content.
[383:57.25]Well, what else are you paying for?

[384:08.13]Oh, thanks for the sub, man.
[384:09.13]Like, what are you paying for?
[384:19.62]You have actively decided, on your own free will, to continuously, continuously, for a lot of people, pay to my bank account a monthly payment.
[384:41.29]At some point, you have to think about, what am I paying for?
[384:47.69]Oh, I want to give you money because I like you.
[384:49.77]Okay.
[384:51.19]Thank you so much, but... What are you paying for?
[385:01.64]That's something that I fucking think about all the time.
[385:10.09]Which is why, oh, I want to do this, I want to try that, I want to try this, I want to try something like that, I want to do something new, I want to bring something new, let's do a skit, let's do a fucking community event.
[385:19.96]That's why I want to do that shit.
[385:21.20]Okay.
[385:43.02]That's $500.
[385:43.24]From Deuce the Gamer.
[385:49.50]What you've... $500.
[386:12.19]I think that's the most amount of money I've ever seen in one bit.
[386:16.21]That's fucking ridiculous, man.
[386:20.07]That is ridiculous.
[386:22.64]That is like a month of fucking like a part-time income.
[386:27.40]Like two or three weeks.
[386:34.10]And Deuce the Gamer says...
[386:41.64]Uh, oh yeah, before I go, please do a Fortnite dance.
[386:45.77]I told you, my favorite Fort- I'm tired, uh, yeah.

[386:52.11]This one.
[387:09.04]There's a lot coming.
[387:13.72]And a ton of you people have paid for it.
[387:18.46]Already.
[387:21.10]Like a ton of you guys have paid for it.
[387:23.16]I hope the things that you will see in the next couple months, you think are fun.
[387:32.21]That's all I can say.
[387:43.78]The power of Christ compels you.
[387:48.27]Streamer does anything for money.
[387:52.15]It's five fucking hundred dollars.
[387:54.33]I can't, I still can't fucking believe it whenever it happens, man.
[388:08.63]That's the most I think I've ever received, ever.
[388:21.88]Why would I show my dick now of all the times to ask for that?
[388:28.84]Why would that happen now?
[388:33.97]I can't even pay attention to this.
[388:55.11]Alright, where did these go?
[389:04.78]Make his dick cry.
[389:24.01]I need the engine thing back.
[389:32.30]Where does this go?
[389:34.28]Circle through here.
[389:43.96]I'm just glad you find happiness in this stream.
[389:50.48]I don't have much else to say.
[389:53.87]I could go off on like a tangent about it.
[389:56.05]I've done it a couple times already.
[390:15.23]There are some streams that when I end them I'm lying in bed and I look at the ceiling
[390:24.70]And I just say to myself, holy fucking shit, dude.
[390:30.00]How?
[390:31.64]What happened?
[390:33.08]How is that even possible?
[390:36.12]This is gonna be one of them.
[391:01.36]Why are you not crying yet?
[391:04.03]Because there's no reason to cry.
[391:05.37]There's no- Well, I don't have a reason to cry.
[391:09.45]I have a reason to be very happy.
[391:13.77]And, incredibly importantly, I have a lot of reasons to be very, very, very happy.
[391:21.70]And a ton of the messages that I read from people are about, Hey dude, uh, my life, like, sucks!
[391:42.76]He's getting close!
[391:48.72]And it's like, fuck, man.
[391:52.52]Like, oh, like, I've had such a hard time.
[391:54.28]Like, this stream is so much fun.
[391:56.73]And you don't think that I think about that?
[392:00.15]Like, all the fucking time?
[392:01.11]You know what I mean?
[392:03.98]And then I see, like, huge, fucking huge amounts of money coming to the stream, and it's like, god damn.
[392:28.30]It better be fucking worth it.
[392:30.46]It better be.
[392:33.38]I'm just happy to fucking hang out and be here, man.
[392:39.06]You're trying to get it.
[392:40.68]You almost got it.
[392:41.52]It was close.
[392:43.35]It was real close.
[392:48.43]You made yourselves cry.
[392:53.17]But that's for real.
[392:56.55]I actually saw a clip of Kripparian.
[393:01.68]who mentioned something similar.
[393:04.35]And I have a lot of respect for Kripparian.
[393:07.33]He's kind of an OG in this space, right?
[393:10.75]But it's like, whenever I hear something like that, I start to internalize it, you know?
[393:18.43]And I try to think about, you know, I wanna make sure that person's alright.
[393:22.55]I mean, that person's having fun.
[393:23.83]That person's okay, you know what I mean?
[393:28.45]It's something that you think about a lot.
[393:33.95]It just got to that donation now.
[393:36.39]Yeah.
[393:37.25]There it is.
[393:38.33]Five fucking hundred.
[393:44.80]But yeah.
[393:46.72]If you think that's something that... I'm not the only one.
[393:49.62]There's plenty of other streamers and content creators that take a lot of, you know, pride and a lot of... A lot of... They're like, wow, I'm actually helping somebody.
[394:01.55]It means a lot to hear that.
[394:05.55]I heard Kripp say that the other day, and I was like, holy shit.
[394:07.95]I'm like, alright, well, respect for you just increased by fucking a thousand percent.
[394:12.34]You know what I mean?
[394:18.64]But Kripp is Kripp.
[394:19.50]You know, everybody knows who that is.
[394:25.51]He's going to retire.
[394:27.53]Not in the plans at all.
[394:31.39]Who is Kripp airing it?
[394:33.43]Kripp?
[394:33.73]You don't know who Kripp is?
[394:34.57]Come on.
[394:37.26]You don't know who Kripp is.
[394:38.24]He's like Hearthstone, Diablo, Path of Exile.
[394:44.73]I've never heard of that person in my life.
[394:48.33]Oh, a Kripp?
[394:49.73]A cryptocurrency?
[394:50.69]Yeah, that's a guy.
[394:55.99]Kripp is a salty baby who cries over children's card games.
[394:59.81]Well, excuse me.
[395:02.01]What am I doing right now?
[395:06.95]What is this?
[395:12.50]This is an adult game.

[397:02.92]And if you think that's just a joke, sorry, but that's not part of the routine.
[397:15.21]I found out you were streaming and I've been here since.

[457:31.31]I'm not gonna smash it.
[457:35.55]The pedal is giving me some resistance now, though.
[457:39.17]Did I fuck it up?
[457:41.01]No, I think it's okay.
[457:51.29]It didn't do anything.
[458:05.88]Does it know that I don't have a foot on it?
[458:07.84]Apparently.
[458:13.63]Alright, as fast as I fucking can go down the hill, go.
[458:40.03]Dropping on two wheels.
[458:46.06]Turn signal!
[458:53.36]Oh, you're dead.

[460:41.40]Oh my god, I don't want to hear Mr. Vercetti tell me a little bullshit, please.
[460:55.35]Now, break it!
[460:56.87]Uhh... I can't move.
[461:18.63]How do I, like, how do I go back?
[461:20.99]Get this fucking key out of here.
[461:23.95]First of all.
[461:29.74]I got the key.
[461:30.50]You know, we're not going anywhere.

[483:06.93]But I wouldn't consider it a savory smell.
[483:13.20]Come on, buddy.
[483:13.82]We're taking you to rehab.
[483:17.62]You guys know, it's a savory... Ah, whatever.
[483:21.07]David Cage, thanks for the one dollar.
[483:25.05]Why didn't you tell us Otto was ten?
[483:27.97]Jerma, he's going to die.
[483:29.25]Thanks.
[483:30.01]Make me love a dog who would die.
[483:32.35]What the fuck are you talking about?
[483:33.89]Otto is like seven.
[483:35.79]What?
[483:38.31]Otto is seven years old.
[483:39.68]He's not ten.
[483:40.40]Where'd you get that info from?
[483:41.64]I didn't say that.
[483:43.74]Come on, man.
[483:47.72]Come on.
[483:53.85]That's fake.
[483:56.11]Uh, thank you Darkstar again for the one dollar.
[483:58.91]Jeremy vs. Critical.
[483:59.89]Jeremy vs. Critical.
[484:02.23]Everyone wants to see this happen.
[484:08.59]He's a good dude.
[484:11.17]Joel's a great guy.
[484:12.01]Critical's a great guy.
[484:14.95]Give them nothing but the best.
[484:16.21]Thank you.
[484:17.85]Uh, Darkstar, thank you for that one dollar.
[484:20.41]E-Dragon, thanks for the $2.50.
[484:24.52]I really think you should start seeing a therapist.
[484:26.44]These drunk fits of rage are really concerning and I don't think Otto should have to put up with them.
[484:36.49]Otto's downstairs with Kim.
[484:40.47]What are you talking about?
[484:43.05]Thank you so much, though.
[484:44.73]Darkstar again for the $1.

[490:47.92]Thank you.
[490:50.23]Thanks for even considering.
[490:52.46]Thank you so much, Novi.
[490:55.54]Matters of Darkness gave a bunch of community subs.
[491:03.48]What is this?
[491:03.84]Hey, hello everybody.
[491:05.26]Let me introduce myself.
[491:06.42]My name is Jerma.
[491:07.31]I'm gonna start doing gameplay commentary.
[491:08.87]Some of you people might already know me from playing in servers, but some of you probably don't.
[491:13.43]This is my introduction to you guys.
[491:14.65]I'm going to just do Team Fortress commentaries, but I'm gonna do other stuff.
[491:17.37]Most notably, I'll do Team Fortress stuff because I love the game and it's my absolute favorite game in the world right now.
[491:22.84]It has been... What is that?
[491:26.66]That's my first video?
[491:30.32]What does that part mean?
[491:31.12]You might know me from servers.
[491:34.57]Like you might know me from a server?
[491:37.52]Who the fuck was that?
[491:39.14]Who the hell was I talking to?
[491:57.11]That's not my video.
[491:58.71]I didn't make that.
[492:06.99]Did I actually say that in this video?
[492:26.74]Hello, everybody.
[492:27.72]I'm going to introduce myself right here.
[492:31.16]My name is Jerma.
[492:33.10]I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[492:35.52]Some people might already know me from playing in servers.
[492:38.13]What?
[492:39.09]Some of you probably don't.
[492:40.37]What are you talking about?
[492:43.39]I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.
[492:45.31]I'm going to do other stuff.
[492:48.12]Hello, everybody.
[492:48.98]Who would know me from servers?
[492:52.00]Right here.
[492:52.52]My name is Jerma.
[492:54.48]I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[492:56.90]Some people might already know me from playing in servers.
[492:58.94]Some of you probably don't, and this is my introduction to you guys.
[493:04.77]I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.
[493:06.71]I'm going to do other stuff too.
[493:07.77]I'm going to be able to tell Labos drunk on stream.
[493:11.29]But most notably, I'll do Team Fortress stuff because I love the game.
[493:14.23]It is my absolute favorite game in the world right now.
[493:18.80]It has been for a while.
[493:20.26]I've been playing Team Fortress since beta.
[493:22.21]How good was I?
[493:23.33]And before that, I played Team Fortress Classic.
[493:24.85]How good was I?
[493:25.73]For three or four years also.
[493:27.09]So, I'm a huge fan of the series.
[493:30.63]And when Team Fortress 3 crumbs out... I still have that problem.
[493:35.19]When Team Fortress 3 crumbs out, I'll be getting that too.
[493:38.21]So, I'm playing right now.
[493:42.23]I jumped in a little late here.
[493:44.13]This is Gold Rush.
[493:46.21]I'm playing Dead Ringer Spy with Kunai.
[493:48.87]and the Latorenga, uh, whatever however you pronounce it, I believe it's, uh... Three fucking stabs, beautiful.
[493:53.19]It's Latronjer, I think that's how you... It's Latronjay, idiot.
[493:56.49]...actually you say it.
[493:57.89]But you know what, I don't give a shit about name pronunciations, who cares, this is a gameplay commentary, you guys wanna see me kill shit.
[494:06.43]Getting right to the point, I, I agree.
[494:08.87]So, as I said, I'm the Dead Ringer, this is Goldrush, they're pushing the last point, I'm on defense, and this scout stood still for too long, so that means he's dead.
[494:18.65]A pyro lights me on fire, and I want you guys to pay attention to something.
[494:21.49]This is really, really weird.
[494:23.39]So I'm on fire right now, okay?
[494:25.89]So I better look for some health or get healed by a medic or something.
[494:29.65]You would expect me to do that, right?
[494:31.95]So I don't, and my life doesn't really go anywhere, but I'm still on fire.
[494:37.82]This is a big problem.
[494:38.40]And for the remainder of this video... What do you mean, tuber voice?
[494:43.22]This is me just talking.
[494:44.28]What do you mean tuber?
[494:45.34]I didn't bring the tuber voice out until like a year or two later.
[494:48.79]I'm going to be on fire.
[494:51.75]See, I just picked up health kit right there, but it doesn't matter.
[494:53.85]I'm still on fire.
[494:56.37]I don't understand why that happened.
[494:57.43]There was something going on in the video editing process.
[495:00.49]Killed that heavy.
[495:01.13]I think that medic was about to charge it over or something, but he jumps to his death.
[495:07.00]And I don't know why I did that, to tell you the truth.
[495:08.72]He could have just ran backwards, but... So I'm still on fire.
[495:11.48]Let me pick this health kit up again.
[495:13.30]Still on fire.
[495:14.76]I'm not sure if it's bugged, like I said, but...
[495:18.14]I love Dead Ringer.
[495:18.86]I love The Spy.
[495:19.52]It's my most played class.
[495:20.90]It is.
[495:22.32]Next to that, I think it's Engineer.
[495:24.96]It is.
[495:25.60]Still.
[495:25.86]Yeah, it is.
[495:26.58]I think 100 hours or so.
[495:27.40]It's five years later.
[495:29.06]But Dead Ringer, people will complain and say, well, Dead Ringer is for retarded people that are stupid.
[495:37.03]And they don't.
[495:37.45]The Spy, by the way, notices that I hear.
[495:39.17]Well, alright.
[495:40.39]Well, that's 2012.
[495:40.95]Alright.
[495:41.45]Well, that's maybe.
[495:42.49]Okay.
[495:42.81]I heard the noise, but.
[495:44.78]He doesn't try and come after me.
[495:46.18]You know, usually you turn around and want to go after somebody when you hear the loud Dead Ringer noise, but he doesn't seem to care.
[495:51.94]So up here, I get this heavy, miss with a stab, but I get him anyways.
[495:56.06]This sniper, I get him as well with the revolver, which this revolver is hard to kill people with because you have to shoot them, I think it's at least three or four times if you have 125 health or 150 health, like some of the classes do.
[496:09.71]But this scout, I think he's a spy.
[496:11.71]He thinks I'm a spy.
[496:12.57]We both go, ha ha.
[496:21.62]And watch this part right here.
[496:22.40]I don't understand this part, and you'll get a laugh out of this.
[496:25.02]This is a spy, and we both know it, but he just keeps on walking.
[496:31.61]Apparently, he didn't care that I bumped into him, or that I was a spy.
[496:36.81]I don't even know.
[496:37.41]I thought... I was wrong.
[496:39.09]I'm fucking stupid.
[496:40.57]I was like a child.
[496:42.09]What an idiot.
[496:42.59]I thought he was a bot at first, and then I, uh... I guess there were a couple bots on both teams, but I still think he was a player.
[496:48.32]I found out that he wasn't...
[496:51.59]So if that was you, shame on you.
[496:54.74]And maybe you'll get better by practicing.
[496:58.28]So right now I'm just kind of trying to lure somebody out here.
[497:00.64]The soldier, I get him.
[497:02.40]And that's what it's all about with the spy.
[497:04.64]Just trying to mess with people's heads.
[497:06.66]And as you notice, I walk sideways and I walk backwards a lot.
[497:10.85]Because if you walk right at people, as a lot of you know, you're a definite guaranteed spy.
[497:15.99]So I'm trying to pretend like this scout is my enemy.
[497:18.95]And I fool this spy.
[497:21.85]But it doesn't matter because I miss anyways.
[497:24.46]And nothing happens from it, though.
[497:26.18]He didn't really come after me.
[497:28.58]That's the same spy who killed his engineer.
[497:30.80]Beep, beep, beep.
[497:31.38]I believe that's... What was it?
[497:33.26]Beep, beep, beep?
[497:35.14]What was beep, beep, beep?
[497:39.35]That's the same spy who killed his engineer.
[497:41.57]Beep, beep, beep.
[497:41.91]Nothing happens from it, though.
[497:43.69]He didn't really come after me.
[497:46.09]What the hell was that?
[497:47.07]Keep in mind, gotta keep in mind, this is seven, this is seven years ago.
[497:50.09]The first video I've ever made, ever.
[498:13.91]But it's okay, because this is a pretty good run.
[498:16.53]And I'm still on fire.
[498:18.29]Nice little jumping, little side stab on that medic.
[498:22.28]And yeah, I had to bring up the Dead Ringer, because there's no way I would have survived that at all.
[498:27.60]And you were 25.
[498:30.14]That doesn't, whatever.
[498:31.18]It doesn't matter how old you are.
[498:34.09]Which is the best part about the Dead Ringer, because if you had a regular invisibility watch, half of these situations you'd be dead.
[498:40.63]I'd say probably more than half.
[498:42.51]So I try to telefrag this engineer, and it doesn't really go so well because he's obviously not in the way.
[498:48.30]He actually hits me with his wrench, and he doesn't kill me.
[498:51.40]I think I was over here.
[498:52.93]I think he critted me, actually, to tell you the truth.
[498:55.65]Somebody wrote, I wasn't even alive seven years ago.
[498:59.05]Shut up.
[498:59.69]See, right now, I'm in no...
[499:02.71]No man's land, because there's just so many people around, and this heavy knows it, so I go down.
[499:07.59]And everyone doesn't really hear it, but I just kind of freak out.
[499:11.37]There's too many people for me to even really do anything significant, but hey, I tried, and that's when I died.
[499:18.23]So look, I'm still on fire.
[499:20.31]I can't get over it.
[499:20.93]I'm still on fire.
[499:22.27]I've yet to be put out.
[499:23.27]And it wasn't like this when I was playing, by the way.
[499:27.00]By the way.
[499:28.60]By the way.
[499:29.46]Yeah, I saved the video.
[499:31.49]So I guess there's some kind of bug with demo files where it does this.
[499:37.53]And it really is kind of annoying.
[499:40.01]Hopefully it doesn't do this more often.
[499:41.61]If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips.
[499:45.21]If you guys do... Hold on, I'm asking for tips on how to make commentaries?
[499:53.64]Nobody was doing them.
[499:55.58]There's like nine people making these.
[499:58.32]where it does this, and it really is kind of annoying, and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.
[500:03.48]If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here, I have no idea.
[500:11.18]There was probably seven other Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentators in 2011.
[500:16.08]Yeah, but not gonna let it ruin my day.
[500:20.88]It actually subsides right here.
[500:23.54]I had to cut to, I think something crashed, so...
[500:27.80]But yeah, it's gone now.
[500:29.20]Hold on.
[500:29.48]Wait, what do I have to do?
[500:30.14]I'm not going to let it ruin my day.
[500:31.02]Do commentaries if you guys can give me some tips.
[500:33.64]I cut because it crashed?
[500:37.04]What exactly could be going on here?
[500:38.72]I have no idea, but I'm not going to let it ruin my day.
[500:41.14]It actually subsides right here.
[500:43.24]I had to cut.
[500:45.32]Why did I cut?
[500:47.64]I think something crashed.
[500:48.76]That's a lie.
[500:51.10]What do you mean a cut?
[500:54.29]I had to cut.
[500:55.23]Where?
[500:58.21]Do commentaries if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here.
[501:03.33]I have no idea, but I'm not going to let it ruin my day.
[501:07.88]It actually subsides right here.
[501:09.96]I had to cut to, I think something crashed.
[501:14.96]Something crashed?
[501:15.82]Yeah, it's gone now.
[501:17.50]And this is still the same life from what it was before when I walked out.
[501:20.55]Okay, it's still the same life, I guess.
[501:22.03]So I take the hit from the heavy, bring out the Dead Ringer, go back to the little spot here.
[501:26.57]This is a great place to go.
[501:28.23]If you don't go here, you should go here every time.
[501:31.36]Go there every time.
[501:32.04]But that other soldier is not going to have any of that.
[501:35.44]If you're using the Dead Ringer, that's a really good place to go, uh, because nobody... You can see my, like, Steam overlay.
[501:41.95]...the sound of the D-Club, but the Dead Ringer is... is very silent.
[501:47.14]So where are the last ten seconds here?
[501:48.80]This person's, like, logging into Steam.
[501:51.36]We are winning this, and obviously I come out here to... demoralize the other team.
[501:58.76]And it was a pretty good run.
[502:01.66]That was pretty good.
[502:02.96]And if you did, let me know.
[502:04.94]Look at that.
[502:05.42]Look at that.
[502:06.64]Who's number one right there?
[502:08.84]That's Jerma.
[502:10.62]Give me a comment.
[502:11.22]Let me know if you want to see something else or if you guys want to see more.
[502:14.17]I plan on doing it at least a little bit to try and, you know, try and get into it.
[502:18.43]But thanks for watching.
[502:19.69]And hopefully you guys enjoyed.
[502:20.91]I'll see you later.
[502:26.61]That was the first video I've ever made.
[502:30.60]See you all in the next video.
[502:35.28]Where were we?
[502:35.86]I don't even know where we were.
[502:38.42]That video sucked.
[502:40.28]How many viewers did Jerma get in his first stream?
[502:45.33]Um, like Twitch or YouTube?
[502:49.81]When I started, I had an established group of people when I first streamed on Twitch.
[502:56.53]I think my first ever stream was a birthday stream.
[503:01.28]It was like 215 people.
[503:03.99]And it was like, holy shit!
[503:05.29]I have like an audience that's coming over to Twitch!
[503:07.57]I think it was like 207 people.
[503:10.65]And that was a big deal.
[503:11.85]It was.
[503:13.55]It was like a birthday stream.
[503:17.09]That's still really good?
[503:17.91]Yeah, no, it's great.
[503:19.82]200 fucking people are a lot of people.
[503:24.62]So.
[503:29.01]Two to three, four hundred people.
[503:31.17]Like, that's what I was starting with.
[503:33.75]That's still a lot of people.
[503:36.54]If you put two hundred people in a room, you got a giant party.
[503:43.46]So.
[503:45.02]Yeah, no.
[503:46.96]It's been great.
[503:47.44]I love it.
[503:49.02]Let's get back to what we were doing.
[503:51.53]Now I have more than five times that.
[503:54.37]I don't look at it that way, though.
[503:59.95]Two hundred five thousand ten thousand four hundred doesn't matter I'm gonna still do the things that I'm gonna do so But yeah whoever linked that thank you We are getting closer to the end here Thank you so much to matters of darkness 15 bucks
[504:25.41]Star once said, Jerma can make anything funny.
[504:27.81]And honestly, God, that's the truth.
[504:29.01]I've laughed harder at this stream and every one of your others than I have at anything else.
[504:33.31]And I mean that.
[504:34.59]Thank you so much for doing this.
[504:35.73]I think I speak on behalf of almost everyone when I say that you're a gift.
[504:38.48]And you should never doubt how much you mean to us.
[504:46.14]Thank you.
[504:48.62]Um... Somebody wrote, Jerma's an inspiration.
[504:56.00]I don't know, if you get inspiration from the stuff that I do and the stuff that you see here, good, I'm glad.
[505:03.56]I'm glad you can do something from it.
[505:05.78]Have fun.
[505:07.12]Glad you can make something from it.

[508:17.41]They wanted to use my writing skills for Garfographs in their game.
[508:20.85]Unfortunately, the Labo branch of the company was closed down.
[508:24.45]I'm emptying out my office as we speak.
[508:27.57]Yeah, they gave an office to an intern.
[508:29.35]Hey, Jerma, when you lie in bed and think how this dream was possible, imagine Garfield fishing for trout in Alaska and donating trout bits.

[509:52.99]Just to add this to the money pile, Jerma, on another note, I've been feeling awful about how long it has taken for me to get HRT, but one of my last appointments with my clinician is in early December, and you've helped me hold myself from falling apart in the last eight years.
[510:08.33]I've had to endure dysphoria, and for that I am sincerely grateful.
[510:12.63]So wish me luck in getting myself some tit tax.
[510:17.03]We all love you, Jerm.

[511:29.16]I thought it was going to be like, oh, thanks.
[511:31.36]Nope.
[511:32.38]Not this one.
[511:34.25]Jerma, you're the worst influence on my life.
[511:35.91]Your stream has made me extremely paranoid of people who just want to steal my expensive rifle.
[511:40.45]And you convinced me to hijack a train and fill it with corpses.
[511:43.55]Worst of all, I said, haha, pee-pee, poo-poo to my own mother.
[511:46.47]Arrest this person.
[511:47.49]Arrest this streamer.
[511:52.37]Someone's like, nice.
[511:53.77]Oh, thank you so much.
[511:54.75]And then, oh, you're the worst.

[512:27.69]Is that a long time?
[512:32.91]A marathon length domination only game.

[513:21.92]And I rounded your $0.95 up to a dollar.

[519:59.01]Thank you for all you've done.
[520:01.83]Thank you for the five dollars and thanks for being here.

[520:33.20]Hey dude, I don't really know how Twitch works, as I always watch you on YouTube, but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what you do.
[520:39.12]You made me cry laughing more times than I can count, and you never failed to cheer me up.
[520:43.64]Love you, dude.
[520:45.34]Thank you, Truna.
[520:51.85]Add yourself to the list of people that have just given such immense support over the years.

[522:02.68]Jeremiah, I'd give so much more if I could.
[522:04.06]You're generally a nice guy, and you deserve the world.
[522:07.59]Maybe a small piece of the world.
[522:09.35]Not all of it, though.
[522:10.59]It's too much.
[522:11.93]Nobody wants that much.
[522:13.85]It's too much world.
[522:14.95]That's too much world to have, you know what I mean?
[522:18.62]Uh, sappin' my binyot.
[522:20.76]Thanks for the 95 cents.
[522:21.94]Rounding it up to a dollar.
[522:22.94]What we're doing tonight here.
[522:23.68]That's what we're doing.
[522:25.68]Hey, Jerma.
[522:26.06]Thanks for streaming.
[522:26.68]Ever since I found you a while ago through a certain jabroni, you've brightened up my days.
[522:32.72]Here's 100 bits for every time you've made me laugh and smile.
[522:39.76]There's 100 bits for every time you've made me laugh and smile.
[522:41.66]This is 95.
[522:43.42]So I've only made you smile once.
[522:46.52]Hehehehe.
[522:49.75]Oh, not even.
[522:50.55]95.
[522:56.30]Oh, man.
[522:57.32]That's good.
[522:58.82]Well, Vinny is a great fucking guy, so... I'm happy you even came over here from Vinny's channel.
[523:05.28]He's a fucking fantastic streamer.
[523:08.49]And he is a friend, so... He's a great dude.
[523:14.63]Thank you to... BrandTheMans...
[523:19.50]For the $1.
[523:20.88]Hey, Jerma, the work you do here on Twitch is truly amazing and your streams are worth every penny.
[523:24.44]Don't ever doubt yourself or the value of the streams.
[523:26.36]We love you.
[523:29.80]Thank you, Brandon Mann.
[523:35.39]Really appreciate that.
[523:36.59]Thanks for the kind words.
[523:39.17]I am a ribbit.
[523:40.43]Thanks for the $1.
[523:41.27]No message.
[523:42.72]Elizabeth, thanks for $1.
[523:44.16]Did you see Vinny talking about how you landed in Vegas?
[523:46.38]Yeah, I was in his dryer.
[523:48.52]We talked about his dryer and how, you know, he put some raw meat in there.
[523:51.81]It's in the VOD somewhere.
[523:54.19]He was good to me for a little while.
[523:56.45]I screamed a lot, but he would be like, stop screaming.
[524:00.31]And I'd be like, okay, geez, it hurts.
[524:02.95]He'd turn the dryer on.
[524:07.62]But thank you Zazasalt for the $1.
[524:09.52]I don't have big bits or good joke to contribute.
[524:11.66]I'm just looking forward to the future of the stream.
[524:14.66]Don't worry about giving me huge amounts of money.
[524:17.42]Your viewership is enough.
[524:21.35]And I truly mean that.
[524:22.31]So thank you Zazasalt for the $1.
[524:24.97]And your body, your eyes here, right?
[524:28.87]Like you're sitting there, you're watching.
[524:31.61]That's incredibly important.
[524:33.81]It means a lot.
[524:37.66]He was worried about the jokes.
[524:39.00]Wait, what?
[524:43.35]No, no.
[524:44.17]No, you... No, no.
[524:46.75]I mean, like, you sitting down.
[524:48.15]Hey, Darkstar.
[524:51.63]Thanks for the $1, Darkstar.
[524:52.87]My siblings and I have a tradition of making silly short films every Christmas, and this year we plan on making a Western.
[524:58.79]This may seem random, but what would a good kryptonite for an army of 100 grizzly bears be?
[525:08.32]A steak.
[525:10.74]Just like a pound of ground beef.
[525:16.22]They would just go after it.
[525:19.70]Honey?
[525:20.12]No, honey, that's Winnie the Pooh.
[525:24.46]One pound of ground beef and it'll be a fucking nightmare.
[525:28.82]Rat poison?
[525:29.56]Holy shit.
[525:32.17]Thank you, High Fire Spirit, for the $1.
[525:33.69]Neat, I'm a sub now.
[525:36.86]Welcome to the sub-team.
[525:39.06]We don't really have a team or anything, but, you know, welcome regardless.
[525:48.23]Uh, where are we at here?
[525:52.59]Getting to the end here.
[525:58.43]Somebody said, uh, carrot7, thanks for the $1.
[526:01.02]Shut up and watch.
[526:01.84]This is your origin story.
[526:04.98]What the hell is this?
[526:13.39]I can't click it.
[526:14.91]Oh, there we go.
[526:16.75]Hi, I'm Tom Steyer.
[526:18.84]Please join a movement of six million Americans to impeach Donald Trump.
[526:23.04]This is not my origin story.
[526:26.56]Is the most corrupt president in history.
[526:28.30]This is not my origin story.
[526:29.68]This is an ad.
[526:30.93]Hold on.
[526:32.67]Hello, everybody.
[526:35.69]My name is Hill Joe Golomb.
[526:39.36]I'm Jeremy's grandfather.
[526:43.88]And today we're gonna play Insane Aquarium, the deluxe mode.
[526:50.41]It's the best game you can ever buy.
[526:53.03]And it's loading it right now.
[526:57.25]I don't really play... Oh, I just like bumped the keyboard.
[527:01.13]Hello, everybody.
[527:05.52]Uh, here's your origin story.
[527:07.38]Uh, link it.
[527:09.45]Here's the link.
[527:10.09]This is the fucking first grandpa video.
[527:12.37]There you go.
[527:19.17]Ah, oh my god, my fucking head.
[527:21.44]Steve Overlay is in the video.
[527:36.37]Oh, everybody.
[527:37.79]Let's watch it.
[527:38.65]Fine.
[527:39.09]Fuck it.
[527:40.43]Oh, we need to work together to preach.
[527:44.03]Hey, Jeremy, here's your origin story.
[527:46.41]Oh.
[527:49.72]What is that?
[527:50.50]In the name of God, is this person talking about?
[527:52.66]Alright, let's watch it.
[527:59.50]Hello, everybody.
[528:02.56]My name is Hill Joe Golem.
[528:06.20]I'm Jeremy's grandfather.
[528:10.78]And today we're going to play Insane Aquarium.
[528:14.13]The deluxe mode.
[528:17.27]It's the best game you can ever buy.
[528:19.23]And it's loading it right now.
[528:22.05]Why are we picking up my first three videos I've ever made?
[528:24.43]I don't really play video games.
[528:25.87]They hurt my brain.
[528:28.46]And I wish this noise... We're going to click here to play.
[528:31.34]Okay.
[528:32.92]See, I play casual games because I'm an idiot.
[528:37.02]I'm just... Okay, what am I doing here?
[528:42.84]I want to do challenge mode because I know I want a new game.
[528:49.59]New fucking game.
[528:50.89]Okay, let's try tank number three because I still can't beat it.
[528:55.72]I like to use the crab.
[528:57.70]And I like to use the other crab.
[528:59.92]And I like to use the floating crab.
[529:01.94]Well, you know, to get the money in the beginning, you know.
[529:05.54]Okay, so this is how it starts.
[529:07.82]You click to feed these little fish-faced fucks.
[529:11.32]And then, you know, they drop the dog shit.
[529:14.72]And you click and you get money.
[529:17.62]And you click again and you get more money.
[529:20.54]And then my game is lagging really badly right now.
[529:25.80]click that money right there.
[529:27.12]The whole point of this, by the way, folks, is you want to try and get as much money so you can pay for your daughter's wedding.
[529:36.04]At least that's what I pretend it is.
[529:40.95]Okay, so we got four fishies here.
[529:42.93]People are going to watch it.
[529:44.89]And I got my little friend Steve over here.
[529:48.91]I think that's his name.
[529:50.65]So the whole point is you want to give these guys the delicious worm capes.
[529:57.51]Hold on a minute, I have to diarrhea.
[530:00.69]What?
[530:03.32]Okay, okay.
[530:05.70]I'm back from diarrhea-ing.
[530:08.50]Easy as a burp.
[530:10.08]I got a big fishy here now.
[530:12.38]Diarrhea-ing.
[530:14.65]Uh-oh.
[530:16.29]Oh, fuck.
[530:17.87]Somebody fucking died.
[530:19.85]And I got an alien.
[530:20.81]Oh, this is bad.
[530:21.91]You're gonna shoot these fucking aliens.
[530:27.33]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[530:29.86]Don't worry, everybody.
[530:31.30]I got a fucking diamond.
[530:34.69]That means we can buy extra food.
[530:36.84]$315?
[530:38.20]Are you fucking kidding me?
[530:43.12]$318 for food?
[530:43.92]Did I lose?
[530:44.78]Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
[530:47.10]Whatever.
[530:48.58]Can you hear my dog?
[530:50.26]So, I'm doing pretty well here.
[530:52.64]I got a big fish here.
[530:55.04]Like I told you before, I'm making lots of cash.
[531:00.42]I might want to upgrade...
[531:02.63]God why did you think this is a good idea to upload?
[531:06.01]This game is a bunch of bullshit I
[531:32.59]oh my yeah you got it or whatever you know I I'm returning this game I I'm gonna return this game today and oh hello there susie what's your name never seen you what was I just saying about
[531:52.41]Oh, yeah, um, I think I was saying I was gonna play challenge mode and I needed to beat tank three because I didn't beat tank three yet, okay?
[532:04.08]I had to pick crab and other crab and this crab.
[532:10.44]Do I do it again?
[532:12.29]The point of this game is you want to feed these fishes and to collect the dog food.
[532:18.03]Do I do the whole video again?
[532:19.59]The whole point is you want to try and feed them.
[532:22.46]And, uh, and, like I do, you gotta be careful, though, because aliens come out.
[532:28.91]And, uh... What is it?
[532:34.81]I'm playing a fucking video game!
[532:39.33]I don't care!
[532:40.01]You can go to hell!
[532:44.74]Okay!
[532:46.18]I'll be up for dinner in a minute, okay?
[532:49.96]So, like I...
[532:52.19]Okay.
[532:53.23]Like I was saying.
[532:55.41]Oops, all of your fish have died.
[532:57.69]Is that it?
[533:11.59]You can hear the microphone.
[533:18.62]You can hear the microphone getting bumped.
[533:22.32]What a shit video.
[533:23.92]That was my third video I ever made.
[533:25.84]I think I was testing.
[533:28.40]Here's the story behind that video.
[533:30.74]I was testing to see if Fraps... Remember, not DxStory, not OBS.
[533:36.65]Fraps could capture a game like that.
[533:41.29]So... It was a test.
[533:45.89]Anyways... Where were we here?
[533:50.98]We were...
[533:57.40]What do you mean to be impeached?
[534:00.04]That fucking, uh, I really thought that's what you linked me and I was like, what?
[534:04.10]Oh my god, that's so fucking funny.
[534:06.98]Uh, Starkiller, thank you Starkiller for the one dollar.
[534:10.84]I made this video the night you left and people said to show it to you.
[534:19.39]Let's see.
[534:20.75]And every highway...
[534:33.75]There, here we go.
[534:37.04]Let us see, I'm holding, wait, wait, wait, I gotta get it.
[534:41.84]I've gotta get it.
[534:48.52]And now, the end is near, and so I face the final curtain, my friend.
[535:02.52]It's a lot of money.
[535:03.98]Got him.
[535:26.08]Much more than this, I did it my way.
[535:35.59]Regrets.
[535:36.61]I missed that keyboard.
[535:37.43]It was a great keyboard.
[535:38.41]I had a few, but then again, too few to mention.
[535:45.75]I did what I had to do and saw it through.
[535:55.07]Without exception, I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway.
[536:11.19]What the fuck was I doing?
[536:12.37]Alright, this is... The video has to end here.
[536:22.10]Because that was... Oh, I got it.
[536:42.34]When there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out.
[536:51.19]But after shows, I took the blows and did it more.
[537:18.24]Thank you.
[537:46.62]What the fuck?
[537:48.64]That's great.
[537:50.54]Thank you, Starkiller2010, for that wonderful video.
[537:56.86]Thank you.

[538:35.22]Butterderp, thanks for the $1.
[538:36.40]For your information, I wanted to make sure that it was me who recommended you play The Sims 4.
[538:42.12]Because when you were reading the chat, I recommended it and you said, should I play The Sims?
[538:47.21]It was me.
[538:50.47]Me.
[538:50.91]Me.
[538:52.65]Well, thank you, ButterDirp.

[539:57.83]I just remembered you made a Nidhogg video years ago where you played the game and me and my girlfriend have had a lot of frantic fun playing the sequel.
[540:07.02]So I could very much recommend you play it with someone like Etalyx or, indeed, in the spirit of Lethal League, Reunion with Star.
[540:15.45]Me and Star did play Lethal League and Nidhogg 2 does exist.
[540:20.29]It's true.
[540:22.45]Give it a look.
[540:23.81]Thank you.
[540:25.86]Thank you SynthesisPandaBot for the $1.
[540:29.14]I just remembered he made a Nidhogg video.
[540:31.78]Wrong.
[540:32.98]Wrong.
[540:33.92]Hey Jermba, what's going on?

[540:38.38]And Garfield's brother is Killer.
[540:40.38]Just letting you know how cool the stream today was.
[540:42.36]To love, laugh, and live.
[540:45.73]Fuck is happening?

[541:06.32]Ah, Sans Undertale.
[541:08.80]Have a good night, funny man.
[541:12.79]And I'm the drunk one.
[541:20.34]Who is this crazy guy?
[541:22.52]Thank you, PandaBot.
[541:24.82]Double D, thanks for the $1.
[541:25.56]Hey, Jerma, I've been watching this stream in the hospital.
[541:27.64]You've been keeping me happy during this hard time.
[541:30.44]Don't worry, I'm fine.
[541:31.27]Just had a small incident when I tripped.
[541:33.51]And I fell into my walk-in oven and got locked in for an undetermined amount of minutes.
[541:38.21]Okay.
[541:39.03]Thanks for the two bucks.
[541:39.87]Oop, misspelled jermaHeart in the last bits.
[541:41.42]Hope that didn't confuse you.
[541:43.80]Thanks for the two bucks, though, dude.
[541:47.20]SynthesisPandaBot, again for the $1.
[541:49.44]I want to hear a secret.
[541:51.54]I don't exist.
[541:52.68]I don't really exist.
[541:55.12]Well, SynthesisPandaBot, you do exist.
[541:59.75]Because somebody had to write that, so it was you, it had to have been.
[542:02.84]Who else could it have been?
[542:05.14]Synthesis Panda Bot, again for a dollar.
[542:08.94]They say, here there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
[542:11.98]I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight you look so pretty.
[542:14.25]You, yes, you do.
[542:15.59]Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear.
[542:18.33]It's just here, it's Hey Delilah.
[542:19.75]The song, it's the whole song.
[542:21.91]Okay, thank you for the one dollar.
[542:23.61]For like the five dollars here, Synthesis Panda Bot.
[542:27.79]Appreciate it.
[542:29.59]And at the very end, Sidwo, for the $10, Sidwo.
[542:34.65]Hey Jermbo, this is my first time sharing on Twitch.
[542:37.09]Keep up the amazing streams.
[542:38.51]Thanks for streaming so late.
[542:40.45]I'm a real night owl, so I always miss most of your streams.
[542:42.95]Always happy to join in the last few minutes, though.
[542:45.68]As it is a... Oh, my computer's turning off.
[542:47.96]Is my computer turning off?
[542:50.46]No, I'm good.
[542:51.70]The front monitor turned off.
[542:52.72]That was weird.
[542:54.49]Anyways, happy to join the last few minutes, though, as it is always the most chill.
[542:59.50]Thank you so much for the $10 here.
[543:03.86]And let's run the credits.
[543:06.22]That's it for the bits.

[544:03.40]So I will see you guys again on Tuesday, the 13th.
[544:10.22]Otto, what do you want, Otto?
[544:12.72]He's been out, he's eating.
[544:13.74]I think he's just bored.
[544:17.77]Big stream delay.
[544:20.89]Yeah, hi from the East Coast.
[544:22.61]I never streamed till 3 or 4 a.m.
[544:25.29]before.

[544:49.37]That's crazy.
[544:54.88]What time did the 10-hour Monster Rancher 2 end?
[544:57.03]I don't think it was 3 o'clock in the morning.
[545:04.57]500 subs tonight.
[545:07.13]And then so much in bits.
[545:09.71]Thousands of dollars.
