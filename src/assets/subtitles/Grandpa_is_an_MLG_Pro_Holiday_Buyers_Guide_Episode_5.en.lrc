[00:09.43]That was terrible.
[00:10.55]Welcome to Grandpa's official holiday buyer's guide for the year 2006.
[00:19.02]We had a lot of fantastic releases this year, and I'm going to go over every single release.
[00:25.46]No, I'm not, actually.
[00:26.30]That would take all day.
[00:27.54]But I'm going to go over the more important ones, the ones you need to get for your loved ones.
[00:31.91]So what do you say we get this started?
[00:35.23]So the big titles this year that came out were Skyrim, definitely Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Battlefield 3, um...
[00:44.76]Railroad Tycoon 2, I think Vector Man came out this year, and of course E.T.
[00:51.15]for the Atari.
[00:52.39]So these are the big titles this year, and they should be definitely on your list.
[00:58.20]So Holiday Buyer's Guide Part 1 is going to be about Skyrim, and why you should get it, and why I think it's the best game in the world.
[01:06.59]Well, actually, it's not the best game in the entire world, but it's pretty good.
[01:10.33]So this game is based on real-life Sweden in 1982.
[01:14.83]I think that's what the back of the box said.
[01:18.48]And it's a pretty good game.
[01:20.00]I like it.
[01:20.74]So I'm going to give it one star out of one star.
[01:25.62]So that's a good rating.
[01:27.64]What the hell did you just say?
[01:29.57]It's 2011.
[01:29.73]It's not a... What are you talking about?
[01:32.69]It's 2011?
[01:32.85]What?
[01:33.37]Yes, it's been... yeah.
[01:35.99]Wait, wait, so that means we haven't celebrated my birthday in five years.
[01:40.87]That's the only way if I know a year passed is if we have a fucking birthday.
[01:45.05]You're telling me we haven't had a birthday in five years for me?
[01:48.77]What the flying fuck?
[01:50.83]I feel like I just jumped out of a fucking time machine.
[01:54.76]Next up, I'm gonna talk about Modern Warfare 3, and why it made the top of the list as well.
[02:00.48]So, basically, the reason why... Oh, shit.
[02:04.12]Ow!
[02:04.94]I just spilled an entire fucking coffee on myself.
[02:07.62]God damn it.
[02:08.94]You know, if this chair wasn't on wheels, I wouldn't have to fucking deal with... Hold on a second.
[02:13.70]I need some paper towels or something.
[02:16.06]The game is great, and it's really a good multiplayer.
[02:18.70]Go buy it.
[02:19.26]It's a fun game.
[02:20.10]I'm gonna give it six out of four stars.
[02:23.06]It's good.
[02:25.03]Another big title that should be on your list is Battlefield 3.
[02:29.62]This game is a lot of fun because you can drive around in cars, and the maps are huge.
[02:34.48]It's a lot different than any other war game I've ever played, especially online, and especially for the PC.
[02:39.83]You can have 64 people playing in a damn game.
[02:42.82]I think I just got revived, I don't know.
[02:45.33]What is this glowing little ball?
[02:47.51]What the fuck?!
[02:50.09]Well, just like all my other videos, this was a total complete fucking failure.
[02:55.63]But you know what?
[02:57.61]None of that matters, guys.
[02:59.69]What we should be really caring about is taking care of each other.
[03:03.65]Loving your family, loving thy neighbor.
[03:06.92]All that good stuff, guys.
[03:08.92]Because in reality, you gotta love the people close to you.
[03:13.41]So I want to say a very special happy holidays to everybody.
[03:19.70]And Jeremy, come here for a second.
[03:22.28]Yeah, what's up?
[03:22.84]What's going on?
[03:23.70]I don't tell you this that often, but I love you, son.
[03:28.54]Right back at you, Grandpa.
[03:31.09]And happy holidays, everybody.
[03:32.91]Hope you all have a fantastic holiday.
[03:35.25]Well said, well said.
