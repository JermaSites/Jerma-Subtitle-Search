[ve:60.16.100]

[00:46.62]Okay, that was really odd.
[00:50.12]I know Twitch has been having issues, but that like... I pressed start streaming like two minutes ago.
[00:56.29]And it just went through.
[00:58.73]Does that mean that there's going to be like a three minute stream delay?
[01:05.19]I hope not.
[01:05.81]Alright, hold on.
[01:07.36]We're going to do a test.
[01:08.12]We're going to see if we have like a four minute delay.
[01:11.30]Alright, tell me when you see the number four.
[01:13.52]Now!
[01:15.12]Tell me when you see the number four.
[01:27.34]That's actually a little longer than usual.
[01:29.24]Yeah, that's almost like 45.
[01:36.31]That's like a 30 second fucking slow mode right now.
[01:39.69]Oh, whatever.
[01:42.83]Fuck it.
[01:45.44]Ah, fuck it.
[01:46.12]You know what I mean?
[01:49.40]But give me one second, guys.
[01:50.26]I want to get my phone.
[01:51.54]I'm going to get started.
[01:52.14]I'm going to finish The Last Guardian tonight.
[01:55.11]I don't care if I have to stay up till 3 o'clock in the morning.
[01:58.05]I want to get it done.
[01:59.51]So I'll be right back.
[02:00.93]Buckle yourselves in.
[02:01.69]Because I got a new HDTV from LG.
[02:07.00]I'll be right back.
[04:49.92]Wait, what?
[04:57.83]Let's change this to where it should be.
[05:02.95]To that.
[05:06.42]Stream crashed.
[05:07.94]Did it?
[05:11.06]Doesn't look like it did.
[05:14.18]Yeah, we opened up the stream with a dog's ass.
[05:15.80]My phone is...
[05:21.32]I swear to God, dude.
[05:22.66]I fucking hate technology.
[05:27.96]My cell phone just said it had 10% battery left.
[05:31.18]Right?
[05:32.87]10%.
[05:34.19]It's dead.
[05:35.43]It went from 10 to 0 in about 12 seconds.
[05:39.43]Fucking throw it in the trash.
[05:41.95]You know what I'm saying.
[05:44.51]Alright, well... That's... That's unfortunate.
[05:53.54]I just saw the four.
[05:57.46]It's an iPhone 6 and it's a piece of shit.
[06:03.82]Like, this thing will tell me it has like 20% battery remaining and then I'll make one phone call and the phone will turn off.
[06:11.67]Nice job, Apple.
[06:17.68]I do need to plug this in, though, because I have to do something.
[06:20.26]Give me one more second.
[06:22.26]I'm just seeing the... Oh, that's my heater.
[06:25.14]I just felt like a volcano was erupting behind me.
[06:26.89]Hold on.
[06:28.51]One second.
[07:44.13]Okay.
[07:48.97]If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.
[07:50.97]Isn't that a rule?
[07:54.09]Maybe there's a tiny volcano.
[08:01.44]Hey, let me run my cell phone off of fucking AC battery power.
[08:06.94]It's the future, right guys?
[08:12.12]Apple iPhone 6.
[08:14.02]Run your fucking iPhone off of AC power.
[08:17.93]It's the future.
[08:18.57]Give me a fucking break.
[08:26.39]Alright.
[08:28.31]So, we last left Trico and the little boy.
[08:34.78]We jumped over here.
[08:39.08]Hey, now those swears don't count.
[08:40.90]Those swears don't count.
[08:42.70]You can't update the swear counter for that.
[08:45.44]Wait, what?
[08:47.71]I have to be inside of The Last Guardian.
[08:49.99]I'm talking about The Last Guardian.
[08:52.63]I was talking about how I fucking hate Apple.
[08:57.95]That's not The Last Guardian.
[08:59.29]That's a separate swear counter.
[09:03.03]Alright, we came over here.
[09:04.85]He smelt something in here.
[09:06.05]We're going to essentially climb this ladder.
[09:10.52]You wanted to talk Discord?
[09:11.48]Oh, okay.
[09:11.90]We'll do that.
[09:14.34]So, I don't know how that would actually work.
[09:19.72]Because I'm obviously a big fan of people having... That doesn't count.
[09:23.37]Everyone's saying it doesn't count.
[09:26.11]Let me mute Fryko for a second.
[09:27.61]Because he's going to be screaming over me.
[09:30.67]Oh, no.
[09:31.03]Actually, whatever.
[09:31.75]He'll add some ambience.
[09:34.26]So, I like this chat.
[09:37.16]I like the Twitch chat.
[09:38.54]It's a cool place to go and just talk, you know, before a stream or after a stream.
[09:42.30]Sometimes I'll just hang out.
[09:45.32]Yeah, I'm like out of breath right now.
[09:46.94]I had to like run up and down my stairs like three times with this fucking dumb phone.
[09:51.53]So, I like the idea of having a Discord.
[09:55.59]But...
[09:57.36]I don't want to exclude people.
[09:59.39]I know people do the sub-only Discord.
[10:02.99]I don't want people to have to pay money to get to talk in a channel when you can come here and do it for free.
[10:12.45]You just need a Twitch account.
[10:15.33]But, with that being said, I probably will do it eventually.
[10:24.37]I would assume it would be something that I would want to wait until I got a sure grasp on how I wanted to run it.
[10:32.19]You just want to be able to use my emotes in other channels?
[10:35.72]Discord is free.
[10:36.34]Discord is free, but I mean, don't people, isn't it like the typical, like, oh yeah, I have a Discord, but sub only.
[10:45.12]Do it and have a sub only section.
[10:46.42]That's what I was thinking.
[10:49.66]You need the money because you still have 780.
[10:52.45]That's going to change really quickly here.
[10:57.21]Is he gonna go in here?
[11:01.35]I opened this up and he's gonna go in.
[11:04.13]No, I can climb through that.
[11:08.43]I didn't make a tweet either.
[11:11.07]My phone was dead.
[11:14.61]Yeah, I'm gonna get a 1080.
[11:15.81]Don't worry.
[11:16.13]I'm gonna get the snowboarding one.
[11:21.58]Somebody will get that reference.
[11:23.50]And that person is my best friend.
[11:31.83]Alright, so let's talk shit about iPhone again.
[11:34.13]Ready?
[11:35.05]So I just plugged the phone in.
[11:36.31]Listen, listen to this.
[11:37.29]Just plugged in the phone into the wall.
[11:38.77]Into the socket, into the outlet.
[11:40.13]Just plugged it in.
[11:41.87]It turned on immediately and said I had 10% and so now I have 10% battery power.
[11:47.09]The fuck are you talking about, Apple?
[11:50.45]Usually, doesn't it turn off at like 1%, 2%?
[11:55.20]I couldn't turn it on before.
[11:57.72]What a piece of shit.
[12:00.00]I'm never going to have a sponsorship because I talk so much shit about every company.
[12:03.86]Fuck all companies.
[12:06.08]I'm making my own company.
[12:07.22]I'm going to make my own phone.
[12:08.85]It never needs to be plugged in.
[12:10.15]It's going to use alien power.
[12:14.07]Alright, well, whoa.
[12:19.51]Where did he go?
[12:20.01]Okay, the smelly thing is in here.
[12:24.91]Did he just dive in there?
[12:36.00]What happens if I just jump?
[12:36.98]Wow, that's... I don't think I can jump down there.
[12:44.34]Okay, he's... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:52.55]He's distracted by the pot.
[12:53.69]I mean, can I... Is it going to jump up here?
[12:56.95]No, I'm just a little too short for that.
[13:01.56]I shouldn't be, though, right?
[13:03.04]Can I get on that?
[13:07.90]Wait, what?
[13:09.94]That is like a pit of skunk bears.
[13:18.37]Oh, here.
[13:18.69]What did I miss?
[13:19.59]No, not much.
[13:20.63]We just barely started.
[13:22.73]I was just talking shit about a bunch of companies that no one... I always wonder why nobody talks to me.
[13:29.12]Like, when I go to an event and I see somebody from, like, some company and they're always just like, Hey, how are you?
[13:34.98]They probably, like, heard me talk about how their company sucks.
[13:40.20]I don't think it's not possible to keep track of the amount of people that I've, like, burnt a bridge with by, like, saying how much I don't like their products.
[13:47.14]That's why it would never work.
[13:48.08]A sponsorship would never work on this channel.
[13:50.32]It just wouldn't.
[13:52.70]Because I would eventually, like, be like, oh, check out this new coffee from Coffee Grinders.
[13:57.76]And I'd drink a cup of it and I'd spit it out and be like, this is fucking gross.
[14:03.44]And then Coffee Grinders Incorporated would not want to do business with me anymore.
[14:10.11]I guess I can go over here.
[14:13.77]Oh!
[14:15.67]This is not gonna... We're gonna... I don't like how this looks.
[14:26.59]That's how I lost my last job.
[14:33.90]I was just looking at chat.
[14:34.86]Did it say anything important?
[14:37.80]I'm gonna assume I just didn't move this shit.
[14:40.97]Alright, Trico.
[14:43.19]There we go.
[14:46.37]Some rocks in the way.
[14:49.63]How am I not dead?
[14:50.39]I grabbed onto my faithful dog.
[14:54.62]Oh, come on.
[14:55.30]No, looks like we're not going that way.
[15:01.48]It's going to do it again, isn't it?
[15:03.56]They're really going to get me with the comedy here.
[15:06.06]Watch this.
[15:08.03]They're going to double troll me with the comedy.
[15:09.81]Ready?
[15:10.13]Watch this comedy.
[15:14.99]No.
[15:16.94]No, this is a drama.
[15:17.78]This isn't even a comedy.
[15:23.40]Where are we taking... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:24.84]I need to take a look up here.
[15:26.44]Can I climb that?
[15:28.34]Actually.
[15:29.38]Oh, let's just push it to the end and see what happens.
[15:34.46]Wait, what?
[15:41.04]I lost my job at a sports store by talking shit about Nikon products to the Nikon rep who came to visit the store.
[15:46.47]Yeah, that'll do it.
[15:50.61]Let's just get it to the end.
[15:55.73]Alright, this is at the end.
[15:59.04]He's rolling backwards, though.
[16:02.88]He's kind of in the way.
[16:05.76]I can climb up him while he's distracted, right?
[16:12.44]I can't say I graphically like the poison gas room.
[16:18.62]Oh, stay there, buddy.
[16:19.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:25.24]Where are you going?
[16:26.21]Don't you love that stuff?
[16:27.01]Go check it out.
[16:30.39]Don't put your face in there again.
[16:36.65]So, go that way or this way?
[16:40.55]It is hard to see.
[16:42.91]It's definitely not this way.
[16:48.72]This reminds me of the GoldenEye level.
[16:50.44]Remember, what are we in?
[16:51.06]Like the facility?
[16:51.82]What was that place called?
[16:52.58]The facility.
[17:02.70]Move this over for a second.
[17:04.10]Thank you pocket chicken for the sub anime Jesus 369 for four months BF 419 for six months be at that thing.
[17:09.98]Oh, it's your birthday anime Jesus well Happy birthday anime Jesus.
[17:13.70]Hope you have a good one Here we on thanks for the two months snoss rifle.
[17:19.56]Thanks for three months my vengeance Thanks for three months
[17:23.27]CJ and Connor, thanks for the five months.
[17:24.86]I remember when Jerma played Skate 3, that was... Oh, no, I... I never played Skate 3.
[17:28.48]What are you talking about?
[17:30.24]And then Pinwheel64, thanks a lot.
[17:32.30]For the subs, guys.
[17:34.88]And then there was some bits, too!
[17:35.74]Thanks for the bits!
[17:39.26]Alright, pull this thing down.
[17:40.88]Let's see what this beast is gonna do.
[17:50.11]Changes the track, okay.
[17:52.85]Well.
[17:56.23]I guess I just pulled that.
[17:57.98]And the track changed.
[18:00.56]I guess now.
[18:03.46]I was in the middle of doing something.
[18:05.62]That doesn't count as a joke.
[18:06.80]Don't count that as a joke.
[18:09.87]I didn't get to finish the joke, so that doesn't count as a joke.
[18:14.37]Fuck.
[18:14.85]Count that as a swear.
[18:15.55]Put a swear down.
[18:19.27]Let's push it again.
[18:33.63]That was a joke.
[18:34.25]That wasn't a joke.
[18:35.47]I didn't get to finish it.
[18:39.99]I'm 12.
[18:40.71]Good joke.
[18:42.29]Oh, come on.
[18:48.83]No!
[18:50.45]What the fuck?
[18:53.61]Well, there goes the kid.
[18:55.14]Now I play as the dog.
[19:03.54]Is it gonna... Come down here!
[19:09.54]Down here!
[19:09.94]Come on, just crash down here.
[19:15.02]Actually, don't do it yet.
[19:16.22]I'm gonna get out of the way.
[19:20.55]Come on in.
[19:22.51]We have to go this way now.
[19:28.25]Just because you didn't finish your food doesn't mean you ate it.
[19:31.51]You know, okay.
[19:33.56]I'll take it.
[19:35.26]I'll take that one.
[19:36.34]Alright, let's take a look around here.
[19:43.12]Can I grab that?
[19:44.08]No, not quite.
[19:46.66]Well, I obviously have to get up there.
[19:48.88]But, I mean, this is not the best spot to do that.
[19:54.34]Why do they want me to grip?
[19:57.30]Is there another box?
[20:06.10]This kid can fall from a thousand feet, but just out of reach apparently.
[20:10.24]Just push it in and see what happens.
[20:15.65]Alright.
[20:24.45]Now what does that do for me having it in here?
[20:29.51]Hey, come on.
[20:31.09]Can't you just push it?
[20:32.67]Smash it.
[20:35.64]Dig your hand in there.
[20:36.32]I'm not sure why I did that.
[20:47.63]Is there a smaller ledge to grab?
[20:52.55]Over here, maybe?
[20:54.35]Let's just take a look.
[20:58.92]You can go sailing now.
[20:59.88]Yeah, I can.
[21:01.34]Well, let's just... This is a strong kid.
[21:08.66]This box probably weighs like 500 pounds.
[21:15.04]Into the corner over there?
[21:16.24]Let's just push it over there.
[21:28.37]Get in the middle.
[21:29.49]Let's just stand on it in the middle.
[21:34.92]Hop up it.
[21:39.41]What do you got, anything?
[21:42.11]No.
[21:45.41]Stick your, like, tail in here.
[21:54.88]Yeah?
[21:55.86]Did you figure it out?
[21:59.08]Come on over here!
[22:05.14]He's figuring it out.
[22:06.44]He has to just smash up the boards.
[22:12.25]Just break it.
[22:14.83]Maybe I just have to move it around.
[22:16.01]The more he walks around, the more he'll destroy it, probably.
[22:18.01]Let's just do that.
[22:20.09]He'll follow me around.
[22:20.81]Let's just push it around and have some fun.
[22:23.21]Eventually, he'll shatter all the boards.
[22:26.55]Just go over here now.
[22:32.02]Take it this way.
[22:34.92]Hey, Trigo.
[22:35.64]Yeah.
[22:37.82]Yeah.
[22:45.27]Let's move this way.
[22:52.29]Don't you move from there.
[22:54.31]Don't you move from right there.
[22:56.61]Stay right there.
[23:02.72]Stay there.
[23:03.38]Don't move.
[23:03.72]There we go.
[23:15.72]Well, alright.
[23:16.62]That could have taken a long time.
[23:18.32]Easy.
[23:18.84]I'm still here, you know.
[23:22.62]That doesn't count as a joke.
[23:25.58]That counts as I fell off a box.
[23:29.45]Now what are you doing?
[23:32.69]Okay, well.
[23:33.15]Can I just push this down now to get him away from it?
[23:40.73]We can go back here now, can't we?
[23:42.01]You know, you... Just for fun.
[23:45.03]Can you just hit that?
[23:47.37]Get it out of the way?
[23:51.85]No.
[23:56.60]I don't want to fall back down there again.
[23:57.94]Oh, here we go.
[24:01.90]Okay, we just leave.
[24:03.82]Draco!
[24:05.19]Over here!
[24:11.26]Hi.
[24:12.02]Hey.
[24:13.54]Hold on, you.
[24:14.36]Hold on.
[24:14.76]Come back here for a second.
[24:16.62]I wanted to go this way.
[24:21.20]Come over here to me.
[24:26.02]You went up there without me.
[24:27.52]I thought we were going to go around the left side.
[24:31.40]Come on.
[24:33.80]Now we'll do that again.
[24:38.45]Now do it.
[24:40.30]But don't break through the middle.
[24:46.53]Alright.
[24:48.49]Turn around.
[24:50.11]And go wherever you want to go.
[24:52.57]In fact, I probably should tell you to do that.
[24:55.35]Maybe I'll just do it.
[25:00.22]Okay.
[25:00.96]Go up.
[25:01.92]Here we go.
[25:08.75]Good jump, although the game kind of just crashed for a little bit there.
[25:12.61]That's good that it didn't.
[25:15.09]You gonna take us out?
[25:17.25]Take us out!
[25:17.71]Well, there's enemies here.
[25:24.81]Good thing I was already riding the dog.
[25:29.74]Do some smashing.
[25:36.38]Stop hurting my dog.
[25:40.99]I love that this is a lot.
[25:43.16]A little cat swap.
[25:45.68]Okay, compound.
[25:46.90]They're all at a solid 10 frames a minute.
[25:51.44]Alright, where did they hurt you?
[25:55.27]Let me fix it.
[25:59.65]Under here?
[26:03.33]Don't.
[26:03.71]Just jump around.
[26:04.35]Let me look around.
[26:05.21]I need to go that way.
[26:07.40]I'm assuming it's going to open that up.
[26:09.10]There's a bad guy there, though, isn't there?
[26:10.82]Oh, treat!
[26:13.54]Treat basket.
[26:14.43]Treat basket.
[26:19.73]Right here.
[26:22.45]Alright, I'm going to go for a trick shot.
[26:24.93]You guys ready?
[26:28.19]Pet the neck.
[26:28.87]Yeah, I'm going to pet the neck after I feed him.
[26:31.53]Look what I got.
[26:33.66]Hey, look it.
[26:36.96]Can I throw that up there?
[26:37.74]I don't think I can throw it.
[26:42.22]No.
[26:42.68]I have to, like, bring it to him.
[26:43.88]I probably just have to open this gate.
[26:45.22]Okay.
[26:46.78]Well, let's open this gate.
[26:50.69]How do we do that?
[26:56.59]Oh, never mind.
[27:01.55]There's a nice shopping cart.
[27:03.17]Nice shopping cart.
[27:04.90]Good thing I picked the shopping cart that has the fucking bum wheel.
[27:08.52]Always seems to happen, even when I go to the grocery store in real life.
[27:11.46]And then you see the fucking lady next to you that comes in behind you.
[27:14.32]Take this one.
[27:15.46]And it's perfect.
[27:16.16]And you don't want to return it.
[27:17.24]You don't want to return the shopping cart.
[27:19.20]Because when you put the shopping cart back, you look like a freak.
[27:21.58]You look like an asshole.
[27:25.92]You look like the weird guy that can't deal with a shopping cart being, you know, slightly, slightly bad.
[27:33.51]And then you walk around for the rest of the time.
[27:34.97]No, I didn't want to jump on him.
[27:38.29]That's not a joke.
[27:38.87]That's an opposite... I want you to grip it.
[27:40.40]Listen.
[27:40.94]I'd like to see if you could grip this instead of... Thank you, son.
[27:55.04]And then forward.
[27:56.18]Okay, now...
[28:01.87]Can I just walk up it?
[28:03.00]I wonder.
[28:04.86]No, I'm gonna have to like throw it on top of it and then get on there and throw it again.
[28:09.64]Would that even work?
[28:11.82]It will.
[28:13.76]It'll work, don't worry.
[28:16.40]I'm just gonna do, can I just put it up there?
[28:23.56]Yeah, grab it and put it up there.
[28:36.60]It's time for a treat barrel.
[28:40.79]Eat it.
[28:45.25]Three hours later.
[28:46.21]What?
[28:50.43]Come on.
[28:50.73]You can eat that.
[28:52.69]I love those eyes.
[28:54.92]When he squints his eyes like that, it's so cute.
[28:57.18]I love it.
[29:00.74]What a smart kid he is.
[29:04.65]um you're gonna come on man you're not gonna eat it do I have to do everything for you there you go right here good job yeah I need to check now he's just happy
[29:37.92]Now, if you're just going to start jumping around, then that's one thing, but if you're going to give me a second, there's a place over there that I haven't been.
[29:45.95]Which it seems like I might need to go over, too.
[29:52.63]Alright, let me see the thing on your neck.
[29:54.03]I want to, like, pet its neck.
[29:55.21]It got, like, stabbed in the chest over here.
[29:59.03]Let me see.
[30:02.97]It's all good, don't worry.
[30:10.30]Alright.
[30:12.98]Is he determined to leave this pit?
[30:19.94]And do I have to go out there?
[30:21.12]I probably do, but it looks like he's jumping, I think.
[30:24.62]Is he?
[30:24.84]I mean, he looks like he wants to.
[30:28.42]I'm going to let him do this for a second.
[30:30.92]Alright, well, I think there might be actually another tree barrel in here.
[30:36.44]No, Trico, get back up there.
[30:41.65]Go do that again.
[30:42.89]So this time I can actually go up there and there's probably something up there.
[30:51.67]Okay, go, go, go.
[30:55.09]Probably should not have jumped, but, you know, I did anyways.
[31:02.04]Maybe I can just go around and open the door?
[31:12.12]We'll see.
[31:14.54]Can this open?
[31:15.06]I don't think so.
[31:22.41]Keep moving around.
[31:23.47]Alright, do I drop there?
[31:30.90]Then just run that way.
[31:33.42]I kind of need him, don't I?
[31:36.38]Let me just see what's on the other side.
[31:38.92]Out of curiosity.
[31:51.50]Well, there's a place to drop there.
[31:52.76]Let's just do it.
[31:55.90]Let's just see what's over here.
[32:02.40]Oh, this is where the... Okay, that's where the holes were before.
[32:04.94]Alright.
[32:05.16]I just want to make sure I didn't miss any treat boxes or anything that could have been out here.
[32:08.95]Make sure I don't miss one.
[32:12.43]Alright, yeah.
[32:13.23]So I do have to drop down.
[32:14.21]But how does he get out of here, then?
[32:15.11]I wonder how I get him out.
[32:19.61]Alright, do what you did before.
[32:27.34]Treat box?
[32:28.08]No, that's the guy's head.
[32:31.62]Alright, let's go.
[32:32.08]Yeah, why is everybody saying yeah?
[32:37.20]Alright, back up that way.
[32:41.77]And put your head up there.
[32:42.73]And do a jump.
[32:46.07]And then this time I'm going to just fall where I was going to fall and call it a day, you know?
[33:02.60]Alright, nothing up here on this ledge, right?
[33:05.04]Except for a big dog face.
[33:06.36]Alright, let's go.
[33:09.77]We're gonna walk the top of the mountain.
[33:18.23]R9K sounds like an Audi model.
[33:21.09]The Audi R9K.
[33:23.91]When you get in, you can't say the same sentence once in a row.
[33:28.99]You have to wait 10 seconds.
[33:34.39]It's new brain control technology.
[33:38.64]This is going to get dangerous.
[33:44.36]How do I get him out?
[33:48.24]I don't know.
[33:53.99]Oh, God!
[33:54.95]There's a hole.
[34:00.01]There's a hole there.
[34:01.07]I thought it was grass.
[34:04.75]Where the hell am I?
[34:07.53]What is going on?
[34:08.51]Oh, okay.
[34:08.89]It just, like, put me in the hole.
[34:12.00]I, like, perfectly landed in the hole.
[34:13.66]I thought it was going to be flat ground.
[34:25.14]Bought you in part by Coca-Cola, Audi, and LG.
[34:29.22]Well, this is eventually we're going to have to be jumping from here to there.
[34:31.94]I would guarantee it.
[34:35.56]But there is scary guys around this corner.
[34:40.51]I just need to run by them.
[34:42.41]Here we go.
[34:44.61]Oh, come on.
[34:45.85]No more holes.
[34:47.34]There's a hole right here.
[34:47.94]Do I jump in the hole?
[34:49.48]Hang down?
[34:51.86]No.
[34:52.38]No, no, no.
[34:52.72]This is like a...
[35:05.28]Oh, shit!
[35:09.67]I can't open- I gotta open this door?
[35:11.87]Oh.
[35:12.31]My.
[35:12.59]God.
[35:13.75]No, he's gonna open the door.
[35:18.39]Oh, shit.
[35:21.24]Oh, God.
[35:22.64]Drago.
[35:23.34]What?
[35:23.76]What?
[35:24.54]What do I have to do?
[35:25.50]I had to run!
[35:35.00]That guy was me.
[35:54.29]Whoa.
[35:56.17]Oh, goodness.
[35:57.73]Trico.
[35:58.83]Trico, what a hero.
[36:02.43]I thought he just pushed me off.
[36:06.57]I thought he nudged me off the cliff.
[36:10.15]Oh, good boy.
[36:13.72]That would have been so funny if I just fell off if he pushed me off the cliff.
[36:19.48]Okay.
[36:21.46]Well, after that... I would be safe to say we should go that way, Trico.
[36:26.59]What do you say?
[36:31.53]I thought he ate you.
[36:32.37]He's just like, yeah, I'm good.
[36:33.67]I'm kind of hungry now.
[36:35.05]You're the one I'm going to eat.
[36:37.90]Can you make that jump?
[36:43.04]No, he can't.
[36:43.86]Okay, well... Looks like I'm gonna have to do some weird scaling.
[36:50.49]Down that way.
[36:51.07]Alright.
[36:54.21]Well, thank you for saving me, Trico.
[36:55.37]I appreciate it.
[36:59.16]But we gotta go this way.
[37:01.84]Well, I can't make that jump.
[37:04.26]You're gonna have to jump over there, Trico.
[37:11.53]Yeah, because I can't do that.
[37:12.99]I'm just a human.
[37:14.32]You're going to have to do it.
[37:20.10]And again.
[37:23.58]Why would you not pet him?
[37:27.13]I'm going to pet him.
[37:31.79]Don't worry.
[37:32.63]This is a high stress situation right now.
[37:37.76]See, now, we made it to the bonfire, so I can pet him.
[37:43.92]Come here.
[37:47.00]Do I feel better?
[37:50.23]This way.
[37:59.07]Good dog.
[38:04.17]I love the faces he makes.
[38:07.88]Do me a favor, pet your dog right now.
[38:11.71]And look at the face that he makes.
[38:13.05]He does that little twitchy eye squint face.
[38:17.83]They must have studied dogs and cats and birds.
[38:22.07]For like years.
[38:23.48]This is the most realistic bird, dog, cat.
[38:26.92]I don't think it's ever been in a video game.
[38:31.38]Alright, let's go.
[38:31.96]God damn it.
[38:43.36]Come on.
[38:44.70]I just want to get off.
[38:46.30]Oh, I have a headache.
[38:47.84]God damn it, already.
[38:51.26]Come here, let me see your tail.
[38:52.34]Come here.
[38:58.82]Let me pet your tail.
[39:05.00]No, I want to pet your tail, buddy.
[39:08.97]Alright, well, the game is freaking out.
[39:11.11]It won't let me do it.
[39:11.77]I'll do it later.
[39:14.10]Let's go in here.
[39:17.20]This looks like a boss fight of some sort.
[39:20.30]You don't have an arena like this without some type of boss fight.
[39:26.48]He's doing something.
[39:32.15]There's a bad guy down there.
[39:40.18]Think he's just going in It's like I was doing the tutorial easy try come this possibility you could get me killed.
[39:57.15]Oh this idiot, okay?
[39:59.67]Oh
[40:09.32]Just hit every button.
[40:10.18]You can't lose.
[40:15.64]No!
[40:18.91]Kill him!
[40:23.85]Is it more?
[40:32.86]He's picking up the shield again.
[40:34.54]Just gotta get the guy with the shield, knock him down over and over again.
[40:38.63]Fuck your shield.
[40:40.31]Get him!
[40:42.22]No!
[40:43.96]What?
[40:44.12]It didn't work that time?
[40:48.98]Get him, Draco!
[40:51.40]Get him!
[40:57.79]Now's your chance!
[41:05.69]Oh, that stupid thing is like right there.
[41:07.93]Okay, good.
[41:08.79]I gotta like throw this thing in the trash.
[41:19.20]Get this thing out of here.
[41:20.14]Smash it.
[41:23.00]Whoa!
[41:23.32]Did he just try to hit me?
[41:35.10]Can I pick up the spears too?
[41:36.28]I don't think so.
[41:39.54]Alright, you got him.
[41:40.18]Good job.
[41:40.68]I gotta get those spears out of you.
[41:54.68]Don't move around so much.
[41:58.56]Here we go.
[41:59.36]It's okay.
[42:02.38]Is that the only one?
[42:07.28]Make sure I get it all.
[42:08.80]Make sure I rub all the blood away.
[42:14.72]Any more boo-boos on you, dog?
[42:18.99]Alright, you got one more little wound over here.
[42:28.57]I'll take care of it.
[42:34.42]Does it always display the controls?
[42:35.66]I think it does.
[42:37.32]That's one thing I'm not particularly happy about.
[42:39.50]Because it kind of takes you out of the moment.
[42:43.40]Just do that on his own.
[42:45.04]There's a big fight going on, a big climactic moment, and all of a sudden it's just like, you know, if you press circle, you can grab on something.
[42:58.81]What?
[43:04.51]Looks like I have to do something with that.
[43:08.19]I'm gonna turn that.
[43:09.15]I should probably go up top again, right?
[43:16.34]If I were to take a guess.
[43:19.50]Wait, what's in here?
[43:20.20]Anything?
[43:23.18]No.
[43:25.64]Just a wall.
[43:35.91]These doors are really interesting to me, but I don't seem to be able to do anything with them.
[43:42.32]Alright, let's figure out a way to open the door.
[43:44.92]It's definitely that.
[43:45.58]It needs to be spun.
[43:46.56]I wonder if I can just make him attack it.
[43:51.92]Can you just whack it?
[43:54.50]I feel like you'd be able to do that.
[43:56.10]You were looking at it before.
[43:56.84]Hit it.
[44:00.44]Whack it.
[44:11.38]How do the butterflies factor in?
[44:12.56]I believe that means that there is a treat box somewhere around.
[44:14.98]Oh, there he goes.
[44:21.43]Let me just look up here.
[44:40.69]It's probably something very simple.
[44:42.87]I would assume it would be, like, attack that.
[44:47.56]Oh, there's a game.
[44:48.18]Oh, there's bots.
[44:48.94]Okay.
[44:52.62]There he goes.
[44:54.74]Keep doing that.
[44:55.30]Keep doing that.
[45:03.81]Okay, hold on.
[45:04.61]Stay there.
[45:07.77]So that is what I had to have him do, but it's weird that it didn't really work the first time.
[45:13.33]Stay there.
[45:23.22]Well, it looks like I can just grab a cart out of there.
[45:29.99]Don't ask me why, but it's what I can do.
[45:41.65]Trico, you kind of need to get out of the way, buddy.
[45:47.18]What is the point of this?
[45:52.40]I just dragged out a, like, rusted-ass wheelbarrow.
[45:54.78]Is there anything in this room?
[46:01.91]Any height that I can reach with this, I can reach with the dog.
[46:04.27]Alright.
[46:10.18]Are we gonna do one of those old school cartoon launches where like I stand on one end and he fucking launches me in the air?
[46:15.38]Can I take anything else out?
[46:23.35]I guess I can take this out too.
[46:25.81]Or can I?
[46:26.23]No, I can't.
[46:39.34]No, I know you had to stand on him.
[46:41.08]I did that.
[46:42.82]That was like the first thing I tried.
[46:47.52]Let's get this in a spot where it might make sense.
[46:49.74]Can I like attach this to him somehow?
[47:11.50]I wonder if I stand on this if he'll do something with it.
[47:16.74]Get him to sit.
[47:17.28]Okay, well, how do I get up there, then?
[47:23.44]He, like, wants me to do something with this shit.
[47:31.38]Oh, come here, you.
[47:32.00]I wonder if he can just jump through the glass.
[47:39.12]Oh, what a wheelbarrow stream confirmed.
[47:41.36]I know, really.
[47:46.94]Is there anything he can grip up there?
[47:50.68]Because I could probably climb through something, right?
[48:03.95]No.
[48:07.15]Attach him to the chariot and then like blast off.
[48:13.62]Oh, okay.
[48:19.67]It has to do with this for sure.
[48:26.21]Okay, so wait.
[48:28.03]Is that what I have to do?
[48:29.10]That seems really, really weird.
[48:34.10]He just kind of launched me up.
[48:36.06]So we actually do have to do the Looney Tunes technique.
[48:40.44]Let me move this in the right spot.
[48:41.58]Hold on.
[48:47.24]I did not ever think that I would need to do a Looney Tunes technique, but that's what we have to do.
[48:54.73]We're about to get siege weaponed into the ceiling.
[48:58.75]That looks about right.
[49:04.19]Alright, now... Alright, so pretend I'm Popeye and you're like Bluto.
[49:12.06]You need to... You need to smash that.
[49:20.32]He's gonna do it.
[49:22.46]Oh god.
[49:23.00]Oh, I thought it didn't work.
[49:34.54]I thought he was going to just do like a little... I didn't think he was actually going to do it.
[49:38.20]Okay, that was cool.
[49:42.60]Why would you ever have that as an idea as a little boy?
[49:52.00]I have an idea.
[49:54.76]I'm just going to launch in the air and know that I can hopefully grab onto a ledge that's a hundred feet above me.
[50:06.89]There's definitely a treat barrel around here.
[50:09.09]Is that a bad guy?
[50:13.76]Shit, it is.
[50:14.52]Okay, hold on.
[50:20.46]Treat barrels behind that guy.
[50:27.65]Okay, how do I get you to come alive?
[50:28.89]I want those treat barrels.
[50:30.95]There's like three in this room.
[50:33.59]You know, he's gonna come alive when I pull all the devices.
[50:36.31]Let me just make sure I don't pull them all yet.
[50:38.93]See what the right way to go is.
[50:42.19]It's not this way, obviously.
[50:44.15]This is like the last way to get out.
[50:46.89]So what about this way?
[50:47.75]Okay, it's gonna be this way.
[50:53.77]I'm gonna pull this.
[50:55.73]I'm running away.
[50:56.35]This is gonna come alive for sure.
[50:58.25]There's another one, actually.
[51:09.72]I have one more to pull.
[51:13.28]Ow.
[51:15.39]Bright lights.
[51:21.55]I just want to take a look down the other one just to see if I miss anything I don't want to miss.
[51:25.05]That's another way.
[51:31.12]Well, let's just pull it because I might need to use it as an escape.
[51:38.82]Can I cue the music?
[51:40.06]Is that guy going to wake up?
[51:40.93]Apparently not.
[51:53.31]This looks like the... Oh, hello!
[51:56.64]Hey!
[51:57.10]Look what I did.
[52:00.34]I found a place for you to come in.
[52:08.82]Now, there's a treat for you if you kill the guy that's in here.
[52:16.36]Maybe I can just make him swing at it.
[52:19.89]Yeah, look it.
[52:23.77]Right there.
[52:25.11]You see?
[52:25.41]Yeah.
[52:28.35]Smash it!
[52:33.96]Hit that thing.
[52:36.45]I've actually never tried that, but can he just hit things that are stationary?
[52:40.85]I wonder if he would do it.
[52:41.57]See if I can get him to do it while I'm on top of him.
[52:51.39]Kind of need to be... Well, this camera is not doing me any favors right now.
[52:55.21]Hold on.
[52:55.73]There we go.
[52:57.71]Nope.
[53:00.92]Oh, God.
[53:01.60]It's a little too narrow.
[53:14.29]Well, looks like we can just leave then.
[53:17.15]There's nothing else really to do.
[53:18.11]Whoa, his neck, his neck, hold on.
[53:20.31]Come here.
[53:23.91]Can I even get under his chin right there?
[53:25.55]Is he gonna have permanent bloody chin?
[53:31.39]No, I got it.
[53:32.17]No, did I?
[53:37.16]Oh, it's okay.
[53:38.52]No, I don't think I even get that.
[53:40.28]I can't, can I like be like a tick?
[53:42.30]Like crawl under his chin?
[53:45.83]Alright, well, you're gonna have to be, like, sitting in a different position.
[53:47.51]Let's just get out of here.
[53:51.03]Just for the sake of trying this one more time, because I'm a weirdo.
[53:54.51]Go in there.
[54:01.18]It might be too narrow.
[54:04.34]Go in there.
[54:05.24]Come on.
[54:06.10]Let's try it.
[54:06.58]Let's try it.
[54:09.20]No, whatever.
[54:09.74]Fine.
[54:11.54]Let's just go out the way we came in.
[54:14.36]Which is that way.
[54:19.25]Let go of his head!
[54:24.95]You can scale around the building.
[54:32.64]Alright, let's go!
[54:37.77]Charge into it.
[54:38.35]I tried that a couple times.
[54:39.17]It didn't seem to really do anything.
[54:43.15]Last time I ran into the statue, I just kind of fell backwards.
[54:47.94]Can I still zap?
[54:48.78]No.
[54:49.04]That's like the weirdest thing about this game, right?
[54:52.79]They gave me a zap disk.
[54:54.67]It took it away within like 40 minutes of the game being played.
[55:00.15]Put a helmet on it?
[55:00.89]I guess I would do that.
[55:07.15]But I'm already out here.
[55:08.53]You know what?
[55:09.31]I'm going to do it.
[55:10.81]I told myself I wanted to like do... Hold on.
[55:12.75]Hold on.
[55:13.21]That doesn't seem like it's going to happen anymore.
[55:18.65]Nah, let's just go.
[55:20.29]He's already out here.
[55:22.51]I'll remember that for next time, though.
[55:24.81]There'll be more treats.
[55:26.23]Okay, looks like that's the end of the road there.
[55:33.68]We might have to go back in that room.
[55:38.78]Hello?
[55:39.08]Anything up there you can reach?
[55:43.58]Over there?
[55:43.98]Ooh, what do you know?
[55:52.66]They just want you to forget about him.
[55:53.82]Yeah.
[55:55.52]I'm sure they do.
[55:58.60]Can you make that jump?
[56:03.77]It's over there.
[56:04.17]You'll see it.
[56:04.51]Look.
[56:04.79]Over there.
[56:10.21]Yeah, you got it.
[56:10.87]There you go.
[56:12.37]Takes him a second sometimes.
[56:15.85]Give him treats.
[56:16.53]I will.
[56:16.91]And I'm going to pet him, too.
[56:18.01]Don't worry, guys.
[56:18.73]He'll get pet.
[56:21.14]No, you don't want to do that?
[56:22.47]You can do that.
[56:23.73]That's not that far.
[56:32.03]Trico.
[56:35.53]Trico, that's a very doable jump for you.
[56:37.69]I've seen you do it easier than that, or harder than that.
[56:41.49]Yeah, come on.
[56:43.13]There it is.
[56:48.58]Come on.
[56:50.60]There it is!
[56:51.06]It's right there!
[56:52.98]What, you don't like water?
[56:58.16]Do it!
[57:04.46]He doesn't want to do it.
[57:08.68]Well, Trico.
[57:11.10]What the heck, man?
[57:17.43]I guess maybe he was in a bad spot to do that.
[57:21.99]Uh, well, Trico, if you're gonna be like that, then I guess I have to give you treats.
[57:29.60]Although I'm rewarding bad behavior.
[57:34.35]I'm not supposed to be rewarding bad behavior.
[57:46.57]Now, let's just do it from here or something.
[57:48.95]Well, let's just give him the tree because we're already going all the way back here.
[57:51.67]Oh, is it right over here?
[58:01.90]So, put a head on him.
[58:03.18]Alright.
[58:03.76]Where's there a head?
[58:07.10]You got a head around here for me?
[58:11.02]No, that's running into you.
[58:17.68]Many soldier heads lying around here for me to put on my new toy out back.
[58:25.94]I don't know.
[58:32.27]I don't see any.
[58:35.93]Well, get out of the way.
[58:40.49]The head's all the way at the bottom.
[58:42.15]Do I have to do the Looney Tunes thing again?
[58:47.54]Alright, well, whatever.
[58:48.12]We can do that again.
[58:49.00]Alright, come here, you.
[58:52.58]No treat, no leap.
[58:56.10]How the hell do I get down here without dying?
[58:57.96]Is that even gonna work?
[59:02.06]Only one way to find out.
[59:04.78]Like, is this gonna kill me?
[59:08.06]I know I can go all the way around, but that's time.
[59:10.11]We're doing speedrun.
[59:10.95]I don't want the splits gonna be messed up.
[59:13.69]We're fine.
[59:20.38]You don't survive that.
[59:21.42]I don't care who you are.
[59:26.14]Alright, here we go.
[59:27.48]Pick up the head.
[59:27.96]I hope this works.
[59:39.07]No, I wanted to place it.
[59:42.81]This is going to be a little more tricky than I initially thought it was going to be.
[59:45.43]Let me move this out of the way.
[59:52.27]I need to bring that head over here.
[59:57.54]Come in here, dog.
[60:09.45]Nice throw, kid.
[60:10.31]Is it close enough?
[60:15.01]Can I grab it?
[60:18.33]Oh, lord.
[60:18.95]Come on, now.
[60:27.65]This is a pain in the ass.
[60:35.76]You want to do it for me?
[60:39.38]No, like, will you please put the fucking helmet on the ground?
[60:43.01]Every time I put it down, he doesn't do the whole animation.
[60:45.33]He keeps it in his hand.
[60:51.25]Oh, wait a minute.
[60:51.71]I can't even... I'm gonna, like, hit my fucking head.
[60:56.63]How do I get this out of here then?
[61:07.30]I can't even take that with me.
[61:16.24]So I think everyone that wanted me to come down here and do that, I need my hands to grab the ceiling.
[61:21.80]I'm just gonna go up and down and die.
[61:29.49]I'm not sure I'm doing that correctly.
[61:40.95]Oh, maybe I can catapult the helmet.
[61:42.79]Can I just do that?
[61:43.35]Let's try that.
[61:45.41]The thing is, this is like something I don't even need to be doing right now.
[62:08.77]Because theoretically, if I get on there with the helmet, I could just whip it off.
[62:17.45]Get out of the way, dog.
[62:20.35]You know what would have been great?
[62:21.25]If he had just jumped up on the ledge when I asked him to the first time.
[62:23.92]Let me see.
[62:32.52]Hold on.
[62:53.69]Oh, no, I'm not quite underneath it yet.
[62:55.35]Hold on.
[62:56.13]Hold on!
[63:05.61]I got it.
[63:08.07]I got it, I got it, I got it!
[63:09.33]Everyone chill out!
[63:28.13]Alright, knock me up.
[63:37.04]See if this will work.
[63:43.35]Launch me up high, real high.
[64:01.01]The funny thing is, I don't even have to be doing this right now.
[64:03.75]I could have been so fucking moved on.
[64:05.43]I thought I could throw it.
[64:17.74]Alright, so can I just place that on here and have him knock it up there?
[64:23.71]I guess I could do that.
[64:25.37]But I don't think it'll go all the way up.
[64:29.91]What if I launch it the other way?
[64:40.55]Can I just, like, try to... I'm just gonna move on.
[64:43.59]I'm, like, spending too much time on this.
[64:50.34]Because I have to get it up there.
[64:51.52]But, I mean, we'll... I just want to see what happens if I do this.
[64:53.64]I'm just curious right now.
[64:54.58]Let's see what happens.
[65:02.30]Hey!
[65:02.74]Hey!
[65:03.44]Watch out!
[65:08.77]What happens if I just put this on top of here?
[65:11.47]You know what I'm saying?
[65:13.21]What does the physics actually do?
[65:14.61]Will it just fall off?
[65:16.61]I'm assuming it probably will.
[65:17.93]Yeah, of course it does.
[65:23.51]Well, I think I'm stuck on this.
[65:26.37]I just can't comprehend it.
[65:32.87]I feel like you need to, like, launch this thing, but it doesn't really stay on there.
[65:45.63]No, forget it.
[65:46.33]Let's just get out of here.
[65:47.63]Hey, easy!
[66:03.87]Hey, hey, where'd it go?
[66:05.91]Where'd it go?
[66:08.29]Where'd it go?
[66:11.52]Where did it go?
[66:12.10]Is it up there?
[66:15.80]I have no idea where the fuck it is.
[66:18.68]Okay.
[66:20.54]It's right here.
[66:29.59]I can't pick this one up.
[66:30.95]I think it went up.
[66:34.83]I think it did it.
[66:35.77]I think it happened.
[66:36.29]Alright, let's go.
[66:38.69]Let's go, buddy.
[66:40.04]You and me.
[66:44.56]The case of the missing helmet.
[66:47.90]I hope it went up.
[66:48.92]I hope it's up there.
[66:51.18]I don't think it is, though.
[66:52.43]I don't fucking think it is.
[66:53.39]Alright, you turn around.
[67:00.67]I don't think it's up there.
[67:05.24]Let's just get back out where we were before.
[67:06.66]No, no.
[67:10.76]Where are you going?
[67:13.20]Just take us out that way.
[67:13.96]We can jump right up easily.
[67:19.63]What are you doing?
[67:23.29]That's right.
[67:23.65]I'm just going.
[67:25.33]I'm not going to sit here for like fucking 30 minutes to try to get this straight.
[67:51.16]crowdfund glasses.
[67:53.71]All this was just to get one tree.
[67:55.29]Remember, if he had just jumped where he was supposed to jump initially, we wouldn't have done any of this.
[68:05.74]I just can't, like, I just can't put my head around it right now.
[68:17.56]Get up there.
[68:21.06]Where are you going?
[68:21.60]You're not going that way, are you?
[68:23.94]Let's go the other way.
[68:30.38]You going?
[68:41.33]Turn around, buddy.
[68:44.67]Turn.
[68:45.20]Turn.
[68:58.00]Is this the guy that defeated Dark Souls?
[69:01.64]It is.
[69:02.80]It is that guy.
[69:03.42]Alright, watch out.
[69:16.04]You're gonna laugh my ass off if this is Helmet Rider.
[69:18.92]No, why would they be?
[69:21.60]Wait, what?
[69:31.34]Let me make sure I didn't miss anything over here.
[69:32.67]This is the way I went before.
[69:36.87]Hey, dog!
[70:04.26]People are yelling the balcony?
[70:07.58]Wait, there was one on the balcony?
[70:16.19]So wait, we did that all for no reason is what you're saying?
[70:22.09]Which balcony?
[70:24.79]Darkscape 3 stream.
[70:40.56]Balcony seating.
[70:42.40]Chariko, watch out.
[70:44.27]Wait, was there actually a helmet on one of these balconies?
[70:56.57]Where?
[71:10.31]There's only like two balconies.
[71:11.45]I don't see a head over here.
[71:23.49]Not that one.
[71:25.63]Where are my new emotes?
[71:26.39]They're coming.
[71:28.71]Finding Waldo Part 2.
[71:36.22]Ah, well, whatever.
[71:38.20]Which balcony?
[71:38.92]Find it for yourself.
[71:49.27]It's in the baloney.
[71:51.93]Oh, is this a head?
[71:52.39]Is this a guy's head?
[71:53.15]I'll take it.
[71:59.97]It's probably somewhere.
[72:01.62]I don't know.
[72:02.08]Whatever.
[72:06.08]I want to just keep moving.
[72:06.92]I'm not going to stick around here this long.
[72:12.60]I want to try to get him to do the thing I want him to do initially, which is go up there.
[72:25.18]Come on, dog.
[72:30.48]Come here, you.
[72:33.65]Helmet was the friends we made along the way.
[72:39.07]No, I'm not spending any more time doing that.
[72:41.21]Like... Like, remember like 30 minutes ago when I was here?
[72:45.23]Like, I was continuing the game and I was completing the game?
[72:49.86]Not trying to get one of the fucking secret treats.
[72:57.27]If he does this immediately, I'm gonna be fucking Robbie Rotten.
[73:25.08]He's looking over there.
[73:25.80]I mean, like, why don't you just do it?
[73:33.50]You're taking all kinds of time looking over at that.
[73:35.21]I'm not sure why you won't just jump up there.
[73:46.12]Slip and slide.
[73:51.30]Look at this net.
[73:52.30]What is going on?
[73:59.85]He obviously doesn't want to do that.
[74:04.13]I'm not sure why.
[74:05.35]It's like right there.
[74:06.65]He's so close.
[74:08.17]Why doesn't he just wanna do it?
[74:10.97]What's his problem?
[74:20.52]I see like the water.
[74:34.11]I just fell.
[74:41.07]I'm getting him inside.
[74:50.57]Let's go.
[74:55.65]Come on.
[74:56.07]I gotta find a way to make you jump up this ledge.
[75:07.94]Oh god, the game crashed.
[75:15.22]What?
[75:17.22]Even the game fucking hates me.
[75:21.62]Hold on.
[75:33.27]Uh, okay.
[75:43.64]Well... Here we go again.
[75:57.70]Watch it start.
[75:58.30]Watch it corrupt my save file and start like an hour ago.
[76:09.85]Oh no.
[76:14.07]Oh, no.
[76:17.45]Come on, don't tell me.
[76:20.85]No, it just was a little hiccup.
[76:25.63]Okay.
[76:28.40]You're not going to do it.
[76:29.20]An hour ago in the same spot.
[76:30.70]An hour ago is the same spot.
[76:32.24]No, not really.
[76:33.14]That was like 20, 30 minutes.
[76:35.72]I got too caught up in people wanting me to get the treat basket and I just couldn't fucking figure it out because my brain is fucking Swiss cheese apparently.
[77:08.51]Alright, where's it gonna put us?
[77:10.51]Up here, okay, good.
[77:11.95]Alright.
[77:21.93]Why are you not open?
[77:27.86]Why is this not open?
[77:39.53]Okay, well, that put us back actually pretty far.
[77:51.81]Is there another switch that I didn't get over here somewhere?
[77:58.66]Dog, what are you doing?
[78:01.82]Dog, you can't fit in here right now.
[78:08.50]Hey!
[78:15.93]Okay, well, how do I open the second one, then?
[78:20.35]I don't remember seeing a switch anywhere.
[78:26.41]All the switches are open.
[78:33.92]That's the right one.
[78:38.76]Let me just take a look at it from the other side.
[78:45.46]Let's take a look.
[78:46.00]Because that's open.
[78:58.11]Now he can't... But he can't get in here.
[79:03.95]No.
[79:04.49]So he definitely has to come out through there, I would assume, if he runs.
[79:07.69]But where's the other switch to open that door?
[79:10.76]Where the fuck is it?
[79:19.84]Dr. Steve Bro.
[79:41.36]Wait, hold on.
[79:43.32]That's for this door, right?
[79:47.09]What about if I open up one of the other ones?
[79:52.17]I'm just curious.
[79:56.39]I can't open it.
[79:58.77]I can't push these back up, can I?
[80:04.63]Apparently not.
[80:10.12]They're down, they're down.
[80:11.00]I guess.
[80:16.02]I wonder if maybe there's something else in the middle of this room.
[80:17.72]Hmm.
[80:23.62]Let me just take a... Well, shit.
[80:32.74]Is there anything else in there besides the basket?
[80:35.28]Why is there a switch back here?
[80:36.55]I'll fucking shit my pants.
[80:41.05]Alright, well, let's go back down.
[80:42.95]Or let me look.
[80:46.53]This is open.
[80:47.11]I could come back down here.
[80:50.30]I'm just going to go right down here for a second.
[80:52.58]I just want to see.
[80:56.14]There it is.
[80:56.98]Something down here.
[80:59.75]Just fall down here.
[81:00.51]This is where we came in.
[81:06.61]Broken bones.
[81:07.31]It's alright.
[81:18.42]Anything else in here?
[81:30.80]There should be a switch over here somewhere.
[81:32.24]I never even looked around here, though.
[81:39.68]Aha!
[81:42.05]Look at what I got.
[81:56.19]I found a basket for you.
[82:03.08]Go get it!
[82:03.42]So now you ate that one.
[82:18.68]There's spots in this over here.
[82:21.56]Secret fire.
[82:22.08]Yeah, I got a secret.
[82:30.11]Why am I gripping this?
[82:39.08]It's like, oh, what are you doing?
[82:49.82]Oh, helmet part two.
[82:57.64]Hey, you.
[83:00.81]No, I don't... But the helmet... Even if we get the treat basket, we still have to open the gate.
[83:07.86]There's places to go up there, but I think that just leads out to the balcony, doesn't it?
[83:13.64]Put the helmet on?
[83:14.40]No.
[83:17.42]Come over here, dog.
[83:18.06]I wanna... I wanna go up here.
[83:24.47]I am very stuck right now.
[83:25.71]I knew it was probably gonna happen at some point in this game, because this is like an adventure puzzle game, but...
[83:33.60]I wanna look up here.
[83:48.04]Just out of curiosity, I wanna see if there's anything in these holes.
[83:52.33]No.
[83:57.01]We're gonna launch the helmet again.
[83:58.35]You guys ready?
[84:15.05]I'm going to do it right the first time.
[84:18.07]Don't touch it.
[84:18.49]Don't touch it.
[84:18.89]Don't touch it.
[84:19.73]Don't touch it yet.
[84:22.34]Don't touch it.
[84:22.86]Don't touch it.
[84:23.34]Stop touching it.
[84:24.28]Stop touching it.
[84:25.50]Stop touching it, dog.
[84:33.54]Oh my god, please.
[84:49.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:50.93]Don't, don't move, don't move.
[84:58.19]I hope it doesn't fall off.
[85:03.04]Oh, it looks like we can stay.
[85:06.52]No, that's good.
[85:18.77]Whack it.
[85:26.33]No, no, no.
[85:26.57]Whack it, whack it.
[85:27.29]Like you did before, dog.
[85:34.12]Just like you did last time.
[85:43.68]Just like you did... No, no, no, no, no!
[85:46.62]Come on!
[85:49.00]End this madness!
[85:56.90]Oh, dog, what have you done?
[85:58.89]Dog, what have you done?
[86:02.07]Dog, what have you done?
[86:03.03]No, come over here.
[86:06.23]Come here, come here.
[86:06.83]I'm gonna get on top of him.
[86:09.15]Yeah.
[86:20.11]Alright, come over and do it again.
[86:21.42]Do it now.
[86:22.50]Hey!
[86:23.76]Don't!
[86:24.78]Alright, it's in such a bad spot.
[86:28.38]Alright, do it.
[86:35.32]You know what to do.
[86:38.24]Smash it.
[86:42.51]I love how he just doesn't give a shit anymore.
[86:49.05]Come on, dog.
[86:50.05]Come on.
[86:51.58]Come on.
[86:52.48]Like... You did it like within one second.
[86:58.14]Get two helmets.
[87:02.46]Come on.
[87:03.02]What are you doing?
[87:10.55]I know.
[87:10.87]I know you don't get it.
[87:14.95]Get... Do it.
[87:16.21]Please.
[87:17.35]Please.
[87:23.71]Hit the seesaw.
[87:30.25]Okay, well he's obviously not doing it.
[87:33.12]Over here.
[87:34.84]He's looking at the helmet.
[87:36.44]Over here.
[87:44.61]Come over here, dog.
[87:45.83]All the way over here.
[87:51.15]Alright.
[87:52.33]No.
[87:53.19]Down here.
[87:53.65]I want to get a good running shot at this.
[87:56.53]He's too big.
[87:57.19]I don't think I can drag this without making the helmet fall off.
[88:03.49]Maybe I can.
[88:07.42]Oh, here he goes.
[88:07.86]Here he goes.
[88:08.70]No.
[88:11.82]No.
[88:12.06]Okay.
[88:12.28]Well, I'm going to have to move it.
[88:13.84]Hopefully the helmet stays on there.
[88:20.23]Hopefully it can stay in the right spot, though.
[88:27.38]Hopefully that's going to be in a decent spot.
[88:29.46]Will that hit up there?
[88:30.56]I don't think it will.
[88:33.34]This is not a good spot for this.
[88:34.48]I need to turn him all the way around.
[88:35.73]I'll put it back up down here.
[88:46.11]He used up all of his smashes.
[88:47.58]Alright, that should be enough room for him.
[88:51.14]I don't see why it wouldn't be.
[89:02.05]Yeah, well, I can't figure out the rest of the puzzle, so we're still doing this.
[89:13.81]No, fucking come on!
[89:15.59]Put it on the ground!
[89:17.13]Why does it just not work sometimes?
[89:20.33]I hate that.
[89:22.33]You do like, I issue a command and it doesn't do it.
[89:25.03]And then I issue it again and it doesn't do it.
[89:27.41]Like, there.
[89:29.51]No, you picked it back up again.
[89:30.97]What the fuck?
[89:37.85]Alright, you have enough room.
[89:40.33]You have enough room.
[89:41.81]Do it.
[90:00.85]It didn't fucking do anything it didn't do anything Alright moving on Moving the fuck on and you know what chat you got me you got me chat.
[90:22.17]Oh
[90:25.93]You got me.
[90:28.85]I was told a thousand times I had to do that.
[90:31.60]And you know what?
[90:32.06]You got me.
[90:33.34]Let's go, dog.
[90:34.64]Get the fuck out of here.
[90:41.24]That's what I get.
[90:41.98]It doesn't do anything.
[90:44.66]I couldn't... Even if I wanted to get it on the next balcony.
[90:50.04]Holy shit.
[90:51.92]Oh my god.
[90:52.68]I feel so robbed of time.
[90:59.71]I just got fucking pranked let's go let's get the fuck out of here oh my god I can't fucking believe I took all that time and it just for that shit oh my god I feel so stupid
[91:28.07]Come on, just get me out of here.
[91:30.09]You know what, just for fun, I'm jumping on the catapult again.
[91:32.33]I'm gonna do it for fun, because I want to do it for fun.
[91:36.83]I feel like having a fun time.
[91:48.04]God damn it.
[91:54.32]I was like, that might work.
[91:56.74]I'm sure there's a way to do that, but that's not the way.
[92:00.08]That is not the way to do it.
[92:01.70]I took way too much fucking time with it.
[92:05.38]Alright, let's go back to the game.
[92:07.50]Let's go back to fucking playing the game.
[92:14.31]I obviously have to open up that second gate.
[92:17.15]I'm not necessarily sure how.
[92:18.47]Okay, I can't do that.
[92:30.06]Made him angry hold on to the hell.
[92:31.78]I tried that I tried that I'm not no I'm not trying that shit again, but done with that done with that.
[92:37.34]We're moving on we're gonna play The Last Guardian They can launch the kid, but not the helmet which means the helmet weighs more than a kid yeah Potentially let's get back to this now.
[92:51.23]Oh
[92:56.52]This is the way right here.
[92:57.24]You can go around that way, which takes me to there, but I can't seem to open up that door.
[93:00.76]Let me take another look.
[93:02.00]In case there's a way I can jump up.
[93:09.62]There is absolutely a way to get that, and I'm not doing it the right way.
[93:12.31]But I see right here.
[93:15.11]Let's see what I can do if I can climb this.
[93:20.93]I don't think I can climb that.
[93:24.01]But maybe I can get on his head.
[93:30.82]Yeah, dude, that's fucking hilarious.
[93:33.92]All that build-up.
[93:35.86]That was a lot of build-up.
[93:40.20]But then there's this.
[93:43.50]He had a treat, maybe he'll jump now.
[93:49.91]Helmet on balcony.
[93:51.01]No, shut that off.
[93:54.27]I'm gonna ban the word helmet in my fucking chat in a second.
[93:57.73]I'm gonna ban the word helmet.
[94:04.70]Oh, baby, you don't have a helmet on the balcony.
[94:06.54]I can't fucking even take it anymore.
[94:14.52]Where is he?
[94:16.00]Where is Trico?
[94:18.85]What happened to Trico?
[94:23.27]Trico?
[94:23.79]Where did you go?
[94:31.61]Come on.
[94:40.14]I can't fucking believe I took that much time to try to do that shit.
[94:45.64]I bet you if you just get him in a different spot, he'll do that jump.
[94:48.10]And then... I swear to God.
[94:51.53]Guys.
[94:55.01]If I just have to put him a little bit further into that building so he can make a running kind of jump... I am going to be very, very, very upset.
[95:08.55]Come on up here.
[95:26.52]Let me just see.
[95:28.82]So, this is blocked off.
[95:35.64]There's no, like, switches or anything over here, though.
[95:42.58]Trico ate the helmet.
[95:47.00]So, you can't, like, do anything with hits.
[95:48.74]I don't think you can do anything with that.
[95:53.34]There's no switches or anything.
[95:58.14]What is that?
[95:59.08]It's a thing on the ceiling.
[96:02.90]It's actually in his penis.
[96:05.46]Well... He's obviously trying to figure it out, but I don't see... It's gonna be so mad when he realizes he needs the helmet.
[96:31.92]Let's just go to the other side and see while he's on it.
[96:42.35]I want to get out of this area too.
[96:44.47]Trust me.
[96:47.53]It's not just you.
[96:48.39]I want to get the fuck out of here too.
[96:49.51]There's nothing for him here.
[97:03.04]Like, I don't... There's no other way to get this gate open.
[97:05.38]It doesn't seem like.
[97:09.34]Can you come in here for a second, dog?
[97:14.67]Whatever happened to the second trico?
[97:16.93]I know.
[97:21.32]It got so bored of us that it couldn't find us anymore.
[97:34.25]I need a helmet to open the gate.
[97:38.67]No.
[97:39.85]I feel like there's another fucking... Is that one right there?
[97:49.35]Wait a minute.
[97:52.15]That's not one of those things right there, is it?
[97:55.57]No.
[97:55.73]Of course not.
[97:59.72]Ah.
[98:00.10]Ah.
[98:06.35]I'm going to go back inside.
[98:10.26]Jump on the building?
[98:11.12]I tried a couple things like that.
[98:15.42]You would think that there would be another button in there for him to use.
[98:18.84]I just can't see one.
[98:20.98]Don't kick me off!
[98:23.97]I've been stuck here for so long.
[98:36.52]Come on, just give me another button.
[98:38.04]Nothing on the outside of this door.
[98:43.79]It would be inside here.
[98:52.01]One of those little latches that he can press.
[98:59.02]Unless maybe... Hold on, dog.
[99:02.14]Get up here.
[99:03.62]Dog.
[99:04.86]I need you for a second.
[99:07.81]Dog!
[99:12.74]Can I climb on the interior here?
[99:22.06]Nothing there.
[99:22.64]Just make sure I'm not missing something here.
[99:37.32]Alright.
[99:37.90]Get up here, dog.
[99:38.48]Come on.
[99:42.00]Launched it into the ceiling.
[99:43.28]Oh, you're right there.
[99:47.52]I thought you were going to come here.
[99:52.96]So where can I climb in here?
[99:54.26]Come here, dog.
[99:59.51]Come on.
[100:02.21]Do I reach out?
[100:02.99]Well, I don't want to, like... Here's the thing.
[100:04.53]I don't want to, like, just read spoilers, like...
[100:08.94]I don't want to look over and be like, oh, hey, by the way, like, in the next area, press the button and walk through the door and then pick up the helmet and put it on.
[100:13.82]I don't, like, don't, I'm not, like, a fan of that.
[100:16.30]Come on in here.
[100:22.67]Alright, now get your big, huge body in here.
[100:24.61]I want to look up here.
[100:35.55]Where is the camera taking me?
[100:45.90]Alright.
[100:47.24]Now, let's see.
[100:52.08]If he puts his paws up somewhere, can I climb?
[100:55.28]I mean, I think this looks like scenery to me.
[101:06.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[101:07.61]Where are you going?
[101:09.32]In here.
[101:15.64]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[101:18.86]No, he's just kind of going out this way now.
[101:29.01]No, I don't want you to go this way.
[101:30.56]Why are you going this way?
[101:32.22]Okay.
[101:38.33]Alright, well, we came out here.
[101:42.90]What are you doing?
[101:51.64]What is he doing?
[101:52.93]You just killed me, man.
[101:58.79]Oh my god.
[101:59.61]I don't know where he's going.
[102:07.81]Okay, yeah, I know you want to play with that Okay, alright.
[102:27.49]Thanks dog.
[102:29.13]Thanks for doing that That was cool
[102:36.87]That was very cool of you, dog.
[102:38.90]But I have not seen one of those.
[102:40.30]I've been looking around for them.
[102:42.46]Alright.
[102:48.26]Let's just... This has to be one of those up there, but I just don't see it anywhere.
[102:54.12]Blue door is not open.
[102:58.86]Climb the waterfall.
[103:02.02]I just kind of have no fucking idea what to do.
[103:07.07]I would assume that there's another one of those, but I can't find it.
[103:09.99]And then I'm going to have to sit here for like another hour and find out where the hell it is.
[103:22.46]Keep going.
[103:27.88]Drag the statue?
[103:28.64]It doesn't work.
[103:33.62]Come over here.
[103:39.16]There's nothing down here to do.
[103:41.66]Although eventually I will.
[103:48.60]Yeah, I tried dragging the statue.
[103:50.10]It doesn't do anything.
[103:56.09]He should jump to the waterfall.
[103:58.21]I've been trying to get him to do that for an hour.
[104:01.55]And I feel like there's another gate to open because he won't do it.
[104:16.26]Climb over the statue?
[104:17.30]No, I can't.
[104:18.38]There's something weird about the statue or something but... Clean this up.
[104:37.03]Alright, let's keep going.
[104:38.25]I don't think there's anything like that.
[104:40.25]What else could I possibly have to do?
[104:41.73]You even tried?
[104:45.33]Yeah, I just tried it.
[104:50.74]Get out of the way, dog.
[104:54.38]Waterfall, waterfall.
[104:55.56]That's where I'm going.
[104:57.88]I've done that.
[104:59.14]I'm going to do it again and we're going to see the same shit.
[105:08.68]I came in like a wa... Yeah, I know, like, look.
[105:12.64]That, like, that's... Remember, do you guys remember an hour ago?
[105:15.65]When I was like, oh, okay, let's jump to there now, dog.
[105:18.19]And he just was like, no.
[105:20.05]And I was sat here for like ten minutes and he wouldn't do it.
[105:25.03]I don't think he's gonna do that.
[105:26.01]Like, I think there's something with this... I have to open this gate.
[105:34.50]Unless he can do it from, like, here.
[105:50.52]Here you go.
[105:50.96]Can you jump there now, dog?
[105:56.95]Jump to the waterfall.
[106:10.25]See, and he just kind of sits there.
[106:12.61]And he looks at it, he looks at it, and he goes, oh, I wish I could do that, but I don't think he has enough room or space.
[106:23.21]Don't even fucking tell me.
[106:24.55]What are you... You gotta be kidding me.
[106:26.75]No.
[106:28.13]No, that was like the fourth time we fucking did that.
[106:30.21]I am actually mad right now.
[106:34.49]I'm actually fucking angry at this game.
[106:37.69]Because that was seriously like the third or fourth time I tried to do that.
[106:40.65]And try and run around in fucking circles.
[106:42.28]And I tried to have him do this.
[106:44.66]Like fucking five times.
[106:48.12]I'm actually not fucking... I'm actually fucking mad at this game.
[106:54.96]running around in circles trying to like put the fucking helmet on the catapult and launch the catapult there and then grab on that and throw it you know put it no I tried this fucking an hour ago and it didn't do anything oh that is so fucking frustrating because like what the fuck I was on his back I fucking cleaned his asshole up
[107:20.58]Everybody just, everybody thought I was like an idiot because I couldn't figure out the fucking puzzle inside the house.
[107:25.46]No.
[107:26.05]He just had to jump to here.
[107:27.57]And I tried it fucking like so many times.
[107:29.49]And it's like, come on.
[107:31.41]Come on.
[107:32.07]This is what we had to do fucking like a... That's like un-fucking-believable.
[107:37.88]That's unbelievable.
[107:38.76]I'm fucking not happy right now.
[107:41.08]I hope I sounded, because that was fucking stupid.
[107:46.38]It had nothing to do with anything.
[107:48.76]At all.
[107:50.07]I didn't have to do any puzzles.
[107:51.75]The dog just didn't jump.
[107:53.39]The countless times I tried to get him to do that.
[107:58.25]And it got to a point where we were playing fucking chess instead of checkers, remember?
[108:08.18]Look, I love you, dog, but... But that should have been done an hour ago.
[108:19.09]And we even justified it, that it wasn't going to work.
[108:22.08]Oh wait, we have to open up the second gate somehow, because maybe he can't fit.
[108:25.52]No, he can.
[108:26.90]He just didn't do it.
[108:27.98]Fuck, he just didn't do it at all.
[108:34.82]Give me a fucking break.
[108:36.86]That was an hour wasted for no reason.
[108:40.89]Because those of you guys, I'm sure people got here and were like, oh, this guy's a fucking idiot, and left.
[108:45.05]Because they thought, I would have said that too.
[108:49.70]But it turns out... It turns out we... Whatever, I'm not going to beat the dead horse.
[108:53.67]You all know why I'm upset.
[108:55.99]But it's going to fucking keep playing.
[108:57.57]Swear to god, dude.
[109:04.83]Hey, you earned it.
[109:05.69]Here's a tree.
[109:12.12]Swear.
[109:12.52]That was a lot of swears.
[109:19.37]That's really the only time in this game where... I... Like, Trico was seriously not listening to what I was trying to say.
[109:26.87]And I get it, like, oh, maybe you have to do this, you have to do that, but... For me to be sitting on his back like that the first time, and the second time, and the third time that I tried to do that, and him not to do it after, like, sitting there for 15, 20, 30 seconds... That's a... That deduces a little bit of points.
[109:45.66]That gets some point deductions.
[109:50.00]But at least he's eaten.
[109:52.40]Now what the hell do I do here?
[109:53.40]Now that I'm trying to get off of tilt right now, I need to actually play the game.
[110:02.03]So I can't go through there.
[110:09.59]You should have read some of the reviews.
[110:10.69]Well, I kind of didn't want to read that many reviews because I didn't want to spoil much for myself.
[110:15.09]I read a couple small snippets.
[110:19.61]But for something as easy as that, that should not have fucking happened.
[110:24.79]Like, still, I can't get over it.
[110:27.85]I can't fucking get over that.
[110:33.71]Well, I think I have to climb up and do something up here.
[110:40.41]Order him to jump.
[110:41.75]Trust me.
[110:42.47]Trust me, I was doing that, Hollywood.
[110:44.54]I did that a lot of times.
[110:45.66]I...
[110:47.77]The command to jump is you hold down R1, you point in a direction, you hit triangle.
[110:52.79]And then you let him do it.
[110:53.95]You let him do what he's going to do.
[110:56.63]I did not mess up any of those commands.
[110:58.07]He just wasn't listening.
[111:00.61]For some reason.
[111:01.15]He wasn't in the perfect spot.
[111:02.44]He wasn't in the right angle.
[111:03.80]Somehow.
[111:04.64]I don't know.
[111:07.78]But let's move on.
[111:09.22]He's going to go up there.
[111:10.06]Boy, oh boy.
[111:17.05]Give me the answers when I take more than... Well, that shouldn't have taken more than 20 minutes to solve anything because I had it right the first time.
[111:25.86]That's the fucking whole point.
[111:27.44]Is this shit like I had it done.
[111:29.27]I had it correct.
[111:30.99]The game just didn't let me do the thing that I knew was correct.
[111:34.63]And I spent an hour throwing shit on a catapult.
[111:43.11]You gonna go that way?
[111:45.11]I know that's where you're supposed to go.
[111:47.05]Or am I gonna go pick up a helmet and put it on a catapult for like an hour?
[112:04.89]Come on.
[112:06.31]Don't do this again.
[112:07.45]Don't do it again.
[112:10.71]Don't do this to me again.
[112:18.99]I wonder, should I go outside and scale the balcony?
[112:21.79]Get the helmet, get the helmet.
[112:50.82]What are you looking at over here?
[112:56.04]Get off.
[112:59.15]It is really, really funny though, the fact that... The fact that I was sitting there.
[113:06.86]Let's take just one second, because I want to talk about this.
[113:09.60]While Trico doesn't jump through the ledge that he has to jump, which is right there, he has to jump to that ledge and he won't do it.
[113:15.88]Let's very, very briefly go over the fact that I am so happy, as sad as I am, that I spent an hour doing that.
[113:22.06]The catapult, the climax of that catapult was fucking hilarious.
[113:27.73]The climax to putting on the helmet.
[113:31.77]Yeah, like you're trying to get that to work.
[113:43.58]Jump.
[113:44.68]That way.
[113:53.57]What's the matter with you?
[113:56.14]It was worth it.
[113:56.86]I hope it was entertaining, at least, because I was certain that I was just brainless.
[114:03.37]Like, I was like, how, internally, like, you know, when you turn a stream on, you're streaming, you're talking, you're trying to make sure, like, you do, like, at least somewhat of, like, you don't want to fuck up too much, because, like, fuck, I'm just so frustrated and stressed because I'm stuck here.
[114:16.62]Internally, I was like, I can't fucking do this.
[114:19.72]Why?
[114:19.98]I'm streaming and people are watching.
[114:21.60]I can't do it.
[114:23.38]What do I do like I was having an internal panic because I couldn't fucking do it So hopefully it was entertaining not enough space we need to open up a gate Open a fucking gate
[114:45.23]Okay, please jump up there.
[114:50.71]Some of you ate too much cherry pie.
[114:52.23]You fucking have cherry pie underneath your chips.
[114:57.96]Where are you going now?
[115:07.49]I know coming to this stream is sad, Jeremy.
[115:09.25]I wasn't sad.
[115:09.93]I was just internally like fucking so frustrated that I couldn't figure this out.
[115:14.76]And people in the chat are just like, wow, are you this stupid and shit?
[115:17.54]I'm just like, maybe I am.
[115:19.40]Maybe I am this stupid.
[115:20.66]Maybe they're right.
[115:22.12]I think they're right.
[115:24.60]Come on.
[115:33.23]He so badly wants to do this.
[115:48.14]Go on.
[115:51.49]Go on.
[116:00.11]You know you can do it.
[116:02.13]You know you wanna do it.
[116:04.40]You know it's right there for you.
[116:06.30]Uh huh.
[116:13.76]Yeah, I know, you're a good dog.
[116:15.86]Very good dog.
[116:17.22]Forget about the one bat.
[116:22.56]Forget about the bat.
[116:24.60]And jump.
[116:26.30]Right there.
[116:28.03]Jump.
[116:31.91]What if you actually have to open the gate this time?
[116:33.69]And that's the problem.
[116:34.93]That's like what I'm saying.
[116:36.71]Is... The game... The game has... Fucking...
[116:44.31]made it seem like you have to do all these weird run around things because sometimes he doesn't jump but it's not the case because now how do I know if I just do I have to go back outside and do something or does he just not want to jump up here I don't know I just have no idea I'm gonna like move him I'm sorry I haven't been reading like subs a bit I've just been totally fucking beside myself
[117:18.34]There's nothing else out here.
[117:19.22]What the hell is that?
[117:27.05]No.
[117:34.39]Let's try this again, though.
[117:35.51]Come in here.
[117:38.35]How do we know what's real?
[117:39.29]I know we don't.
[117:39.86]We don't know what's real and what's not real.
[117:44.92]I have to jump through there.
[117:47.23]Let's play checkers for a second here.
[117:48.83]Hold on.
[117:49.11]You know, like, just jump up there.
[117:57.39]A barrel quota?
[118:11.35]I'm not sure, I don't think that would exist, because I did feed him the second barrel, and I think I tried to do it again, and it didn't work.
[118:19.32]Unless I can climb up there myself, but he doesn't, he does the thing where he puts his, like, paws up, doesn't he?
[118:40.57]Yeah, that's a wall.
[118:41.77]Trico, that is a wall.
[118:42.77]You do have it correct there?
[118:48.69]Go over there.
[118:50.34]Right there.
[118:51.22]Hey, snap out of it.
[118:55.10]Snap out of it, dog.
[118:57.18]It's such an enclosed little space, too.
[119:01.02]Point where to go, I'm trying to.
[119:02.35]It doesn't seem to really...
[119:09.87]Go.
[119:10.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:11.27]You got it.
[119:11.59]That's it.
[119:11.95]That's where you gotta go.
[119:12.71]Go.
[119:13.95]Do it.
[119:21.46]You had it.
[119:22.02]You had it for a second.
[119:28.36]I guess... I hope I'm doing this right again.
[119:36.86]I have to hope I am.
[119:46.28]Give him a second.
[119:51.68]Reload his AI.
[119:52.68]I don't know where you're going.
[120:05.21]Have you figured it out?
[120:06.29]That you have to put your... Have you figured it out?
[120:11.62]Come on, you have to have figured it out.
[120:14.50]You're getting into position to figure it out.
[120:18.69]No, I think it's just the dumb bat.
[120:19.73]I think he's just looking at the bat.
[120:27.11]I'm just stuck in the wall now.
[120:31.05]I'm waiting between each command.
[120:32.07]I haven't said anything.
[120:33.87]I'm just waiting.
[120:34.83]I pointed and said jump.
[120:38.88]He just kind of squished in here.
[120:43.48]Right there?
[120:43.94]Okay.
[120:46.31]Alright.
[120:46.93]Do it.
[120:52.73]Do it.
[120:54.23]Come on.
[120:54.95]It's right... It's right in front of you.
[121:00.37]It's right in front of you.
[121:01.57]It's the stupid bat.
[121:02.61]Where's my SWAT bat ability?
[121:10.47]Come on.
[121:10.91]Snap out of it.
[121:11.69]Go.
[121:16.50]Go!
[121:19.54]Please!
[121:21.18]Please!
[121:28.49]I can't fucking deal with this.
[121:32.73]What the fuck?
[121:38.16]Okay, bye.
[121:39.96]Bye, Trico.
[121:54.88]Come on in.
[121:55.42]There's probably treats in here.
[122:00.02]But honestly, the last time I played this game, I didn't really run into these many problems like this.
[122:09.56]I was doing playing it the exact same way.
[122:11.16]He would jump when I would point and jump and not do anything.
[122:13.48]And he wouldn't just kind of stop.
[122:17.04]Today was the... This second half of the game is the only part of the game where it's really shown its ugly head.
[122:23.18]That he kind of just doesn't do anything.
[122:25.66]Sometimes.
[122:29.72]But, you know, I... It's unfortunate, but... Will he jump in?
[122:39.78]He jumped in before.
[122:40.40]Yeah, here he comes.
[122:44.64]Woo!
[122:45.08]I can die.
[122:54.04]Oh, no.
[122:56.10]Not a swimming segment.
[122:57.12]Am I going to drown?
[123:03.04]I'm probably going to drown.
[123:05.05]Get back up.
[123:10.17]Come on, get up there.
[123:11.73]Don't drown.
[123:12.41]Okay, I'm assuming I can dive underneath that.
[123:24.15]He's just hanging out over there.
[123:25.33]Yeah, I bet you I can just dive and there's a place to go underneath him.
[123:31.50]Let's see if I can get it right.
[123:33.88]I wish I could see.
[123:38.21]Yep, there we go.
[123:40.07]Get a diving helmet.
[123:41.65]I cannot hold my breath for this long.
[123:49.86]Thankfully, there's a way to go up.
[123:53.88]Alright, go, go, go.
[124:02.10]I thought I drowned.
[124:02.72]Okay, good.
[124:09.29]Oh my god.
[124:10.23]I cannot fucking believe that shit.
[124:12.73]Alright, give me a second here.
[124:14.15]I was on, like, full... Like, 9.7 out of 10 raging.
[124:20.47]I want to say thanks to some people for subbing and all that shit.
[124:23.50]Thanks to ScaryBullets for the sub.

[124:49.31]Difference.
[124:50.49]But I am a wheelbarrow streamer.
[124:51.89]I will agree.
[124:53.55]Mr. Rhythm.
[124:54.17]Oh, my rhythm.
[124:54.55]Thank you for two months.
[124:56.53]SM Nightscape.
[124:57.31]These people probably left an hour ago because they thought I was an idiot.
[125:00.48]Like, SM Nightscape probably subscribed and was like, oh, cool, like, Jerma, cool, I like this guy!
[125:07.06]And, like, after, like, the fourth, me trying to put the fucking helmet on the catapult, probably was like, I'm canceling myself and I'm out of here, holy shit.
[125:14.74]But, uh, SM Nightscape, if you're here, uh, welcome, thanks for the sub, and thanks for sticking around.
[125:21.35]Uh, Chike, Chike, Chikeur was taken.
[125:26.81]Thanks for three months.

[125:34.53]Darkstar7000, thanks for two months.
[125:37.41]I forgot to turn off auto-resub, so happy two months.
[125:40.13]See?
[125:41.67]See, he was like, oh shit, I forgot.
[125:43.81]But thanks, Darkstar, for the two months.
[125:45.37]Appreciate it.
[125:46.51]Yeah, he's definitely gone.
[125:47.69]Yeah, he's gone.
[125:49.43]He's just not even here anymore.
[125:51.21]He subbed and just was like, holy shit, this guy sucks.
[125:55.13]TheEntireOcean, thank you for seven months.
[125:58.31]Paramus21, thanks for two months.
[125:59.79]TheFrazBoy for seven months.
[126:02.57]The game looks pretty and the orchestra soundtrack is really cool.
[126:04.88]It is.
[126:06.02]The game is very pretty and the orchestra is really great.
[126:07.82]I haven't been upset with it up until about 25 minutes ago.
[126:11.54]I've enjoyed the experience so far.
[126:15.24]Kaburio, thanks for the sub.

[126:32.40]That's weird.
[126:34.54]But thanks a lot, guys.
[126:35.34]Appreciate it.
[126:36.24]Thanks for sticking around.
[126:38.50]Those of you that have stuck around throughout that nonsense, I'm happy that you're here.
[126:43.39]So thanks a lot.
[126:45.97]Vegas Command, thanks for the new sub right now.
[126:48.07]Appreciate it, dude.
[126:49.61]And there were some bits, too.
[126:50.53]Let me go through these.
[126:52.92]Oh, thanks for the guys that gave the 100 bits.
[126:54.76]It was quite a lot of you.
[126:56.77]ImpDude4.
[126:57.85]ImpDude2.
[126:58.49]I don't know why I said 4.
[126:59.79]Thanks for the 400 bits, dude.
[127:00.83]4 bucks.
[127:01.21]That's appreciated, man.
[127:04.41]PetAuto right now.
[127:05.89]I always PetAuto.
[127:06.51]He's my good friend.
[127:09.41]Major598 had 1,500 bits 36 minutes ago.
[127:15.02]Oh, let's try something else.
[127:18.30]Thanks for the 15 bucks, dude.
[127:20.52]Thank you, Major, if you're still here.
[127:23.62]Major again with 1500 bits.
[127:26.22]Now watch and learn.
[127:26.84]Here's the deal.
[127:27.30]You take the helmet and solve the puzzle.
[127:28.64]Well, thanks for the $15, dude.
[127:32.14]That's 30 bucks back-to-back, pretty much.
[127:34.25]And then a bunch of people gave 100.
[127:35.11]Yeah.
[127:38.59]Thank you guys so much.
[127:41.67]Hopefully we can... Hopefully we can beat this game now.
[127:45.01]Not have to worry about AI being broken.
[127:50.67]Going to have to farm so many bits.
[127:53.93]You don't have to do that.
[127:57.44]Late reading.
[127:58.32]Well, I usually... Well, thank you, Great Lord, for this.
[128:01.70]You're welcome, dude.
[128:03.14]I, um... I usually pause every, like, 15, 20 minutes or so and read the last, like, handful that came in.
[128:10.94]But you guys saw how fucking all over the place I was, like, an hour ago.
[128:14.15]I couldn't be stopped.
[128:18.27]Someone just raised the water.
[128:19.29]I don't get it.
[128:20.55]Yeah, I guess.
[128:29.03]What did that even do?
[128:32.15]Can I dive down deeper now?
[128:36.99]I don't know.
[128:40.21]What am I playing tomorrow?
[128:41.07]Because I'm going to beat this tonight.
[128:42.56]We're playing Let It Die tomorrow night.
[128:44.06]Let me just take a look and make sure I'm not crazy.
[128:48.80]Okay, there's another hole there.
[128:51.32]Let It Die, it's like a Dark Souls-y kind of game.
[128:54.61]Looks like fun.
[128:55.23]It looks a little...
[128:58.06]On the interesting side.
[129:06.09]I can dive down.
[129:11.93]Keep diving.
[129:12.61]Come on.
[129:18.47]This is really awkward swimming underneath this water.
[129:26.70]Is that going to take me back?
[129:28.04]No, it's just going to take me back to here.
[129:33.70]Huh.
[129:34.78]Well.
[129:38.34]Don't drown again.
[129:39.12]Did I just open that gate up?
[129:43.30]Oh, wait a second.
[129:44.98]What about up there?
[129:46.35]Can I get up there?
[129:54.45]SLA, SM Nightscape!
[129:56.35]There's SM Nightscape!
[129:59.26]He's back!
[129:59.90]And he just gave $10.
[130:05.72]Can you swim over here now?
[130:08.60]I feel like I got even deeper or something.
[130:12.80]Thanks for the $10, Nightscape.
[130:15.43]You actually didn't leave!
[130:16.47]I'm gonna see how far down I can get.
[130:34.61]Is he diving down?
[130:35.31]Oh, he's diving down.
[130:38.55]What's he doing?
[130:43.83]Where the hell is he going?
[130:47.76]Okay, so I think maybe I... Okay.
[130:50.04]I gotta be on him when he does that?
[130:52.02]I gotta grab him?
[130:54.94]I'm assuming I gotta hold on to him.
[130:57.72]Yeah, okay.
[130:58.00]You ready?
[131:00.17]Ready to dive?
[131:04.43]Over there.
[131:04.83]Do it!
[131:06.18]Go over there and dive.
[131:18.88]Can I grip him?
[131:20.98]When we go into water, I might fall off.
[131:25.85]Maybe I can grab him when I dive down.
[131:30.99]Alright, give me a dog.
[131:41.96]There's another entrance.
[131:44.18]Yeah, how the fuck did he do that that quickly?
[131:47.40]I guess I didn't pay attention to where he was.
[131:53.55]He's peeing in the water.
[131:59.52]Where did he come out from?
[132:11.63]Can I not?
[132:12.33]Alright.
[132:13.73]Alright, try to do it.
[132:16.00]I can't grab him from here.
[132:22.16]Pee in the pool.
[132:32.51]Alright, buckle in.
[132:33.25]We're going to spend 20 minutes getting him to dive.
[132:34.89]I'm trying to figure out... Okay, there you go.
[132:45.41]Let's see, what's the purpose of him diving?
[132:51.16]There's got to be another way I go.
[132:55.18]Unless he comes back out here.
[132:56.10]I don't think he will.
[132:58.54]Back out that way?
[132:59.26]I just want to see him do it.
[133:05.44]I'm gonna climb this to get up.
[133:09.37]Please climb it.
[133:14.77]And he comes back up.
[133:17.69]Grab him?
[133:18.25]I couldn't grab him underwater.
[133:20.13]It didn't work.
[133:26.09]Last time he tried to dive, I just let go of him.
[133:34.67]That's what I wanted to do.
[133:35.49]That's the first thing I tried to do.
[133:36.51]But I can't hold on to him underwater.
[133:42.74]Follow him down.
[133:43.36]Alright, like I'm gripped.
[133:44.78]I have him gripped.
[133:53.13]Go for it.
[133:58.45]Didn't look like I could stay on.
[134:00.95]Follow him.
[134:01.35]If I swim down there, I'll just drown.
[134:09.64]He's like waiting for me to do it.
[134:12.73]Swim down there yourself, I guess.
[134:16.55]I'll try it.
[134:17.17]Just to see.
[134:17.67]Because right now, I guess I can hold on to him.
[134:23.26]Yeah, let's try this.
[134:27.44]This is going to be really awkward to do this.
[134:38.01]Alright, do it.
[134:42.19]Nope.
[134:42.55]That's just God.
[134:43.57]That is so fucking awkward to try to do that.
[134:47.01]The swimming is like unbearable in this game.
[134:51.07]That's absolutely what you have to do.
[134:52.70]Let's just see if I go down there what happens.
[134:54.98]See if there's even drowning in this game.
[135:03.50]It's going to spawn me back in this room anyways.
[135:04.94]I just want to see how much air I have.
[135:11.27]Yeah, okay, so you can only go down that far and I don't think it even kills you No, you can't So I'm gonna try to do that again I'm gonna get right in his way
[135:37.93]Can't see God that was a pain in the ass I'm kind of dying here dog
[136:05.36]Catapult the helmet.
[136:12.72]Can I tell you what the kid is saying?
[136:13.98]I have no idea.
[136:14.56]It was so simple.
[136:16.63]Alright, let's take a look.
[136:37.77]Oh, looks like I have to do that again.
[136:39.31]Is it a repeat of what we just did?
[136:42.17]I would assume.
[136:47.97]Hey, good boy.
[136:48.77]Am I going to get a helmet emote?
[136:53.27]Aww.
[136:57.23]Let's play.
[136:58.31]Yeah, I got to do part two.
[137:10.33]Made up language, he cheated.
[137:11.39]Thank you, Nicosaurus, for your subscription.
[137:15.56]Welcome.
[137:21.68]Uh, maybe we just have to do it again.
[137:23.76]Let's do it again.
[137:28.06]We just did this.
[137:36.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[137:39.96]Alright, you know what this is?
[137:40.74]This is Superman 64.
[137:42.98]That is what this is.
[137:45.14]Swimming in Last Guardian is Superman 64.
[137:47.52]Try it, you'll see.
[137:57.55]Well, this is a predicament, isn't it?
[138:03.37]That's a predicament.
[138:13.63]Can I grab the ladder and pull it up here?
[138:24.09]I guess not.
[138:27.35]Hmm.
[138:28.77]I feel like that's what I have to do.
[138:34.95]Or I would be there.
[138:43.62]No.
[138:44.90]Let's see how much further I can go down.
[138:54.45]Um... Well... Can't reach that.
[139:10.99]Can't reach that either.
[139:30.40]What if I just stay right here?
[139:31.72]Can I grab it from here?
[139:36.97]You have to assume that, right?
[139:38.77]You have to.
[139:40.37]I have to assume that this can be moved.
[139:46.39]Where the fuck even am I?
[139:52.53]No.
[139:54.61]No, it's like attached to the wall.
[139:59.27]I might have to go a little bit deeper or he might have to come down with me or something.
[140:03.13]Can you do something here?
[140:04.51]Can you like put your paw underneath or something or your head underneath?
[140:09.49]What can you do here?
[140:16.57]Stop playing chess.
[140:18.72]I'm trying not to play chess.
[140:20.44]I can't jump out and grab, and I can't grab the ladder.
[140:25.58]Unless there's another ladder I can grab that's somewhere out here.
[140:36.27]Is there another piece of the ladder I can grab onto?
[140:38.15]Alright, we're looking for a ladder.
[140:46.58]Potentially.
[140:59.76]Come over here, you.
[141:00.28]I need the long claw.
[141:11.12]Who broke... Why would you break a ladder?
[141:13.03]Any ladder pieces up here?
[141:16.83]I don't see anything.
[141:25.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[141:26.99]I see.
[141:27.31]There's a little spot over there we didn't go in.
[141:30.19]I'm gonna go in there.
[141:31.69]Definitely a fucking ladder piece over there.
[141:34.33]Just jump in for fun.
[141:39.16]And it's... Woo!
[141:50.00]That was just fun.
[141:55.26]Now, let me go this way.
[141:59.17]Oh, fuck.
[141:59.49]I actually think he needs to jump to these things.
[142:02.45]Oh, great.
[142:06.18]Hold on.
[142:06.86]Yeah, he's gonna have to jump from one of these piece to piece to piece to get over there.
[142:12.42]Unless, can I just climb that?
[142:13.54]I don't think I can.
[142:19.48]Maybe he can just put his paws up there.
[142:24.15]Giant Super Mario 64 sea monster.
[142:29.28]Alright, go that way.
[142:32.60]There you go.
[142:40.69]Looking for a ladder.
[142:45.59]Ooh, tree.
[142:53.61]Fucking helmet.
[142:55.89]I'm so glad that's going to be a thing on this channel now.
[142:58.01]I'm going to be playing a different game.
[143:00.65]Have you tried to get the ladder yet?
[143:03.13]Alright, can you... I don't want to throw this because it'll sink.
[143:06.21]Can you take it out of my hands?
[143:10.55]Should I throw it to him?
[143:11.49]Or do you think he's not going to catch it?
[143:14.75]I hope you catch it.
[143:15.97]I hope you catch this.
[143:17.64]Catch it!
[143:19.58]Yes!
[143:24.98]Good job.
[143:25.16]Good work.
[143:31.35]Fuck, there's no ladder in here.
[143:35.25]Damn it, there's no ladder.
[143:36.47]Maybe it's just a treat box.
[143:51.44]I saw the four.
[143:52.56]Maybe we can just dive together and there'll be something down there.
[144:06.97]I love this logic.
[144:08.19]Oh, head over there.
[144:15.14]That way.
[144:23.16]Go that way.
[144:24.02]Wait, maybe, like... Can he, like, displace me?
[144:29.37]Like a fucking cup of milk?
[144:31.07]Go over here, dog.
[144:36.89]Forget about over there.
[144:37.69]Go that way.
[144:41.98]Follow me.
[144:44.40]Come over here and I want you to sit up here.
[144:46.36]And stay.
[144:49.74]You have to find a ladder and swim with it under water.
[144:57.35]I definitely don't have to do that.
[145:03.63]Alright, now you.
[145:05.29]Come here.
[145:05.97]Because they wouldn't put this ledge here for no reason.
[145:08.17]Come here.
[145:09.23]You.
[145:10.51]Sit.
[145:11.07]Down right here.
[145:15.37]Go sit over there.
[145:16.49]Come here.
[145:19.83]Come on.
[145:25.44]You.
[145:26.30]Sit.
[145:27.28]Good.
[145:27.84]Very good sit.
[145:29.02]Now you stay there.
[145:39.33]No, no more helmets.
[145:48.76]Oh, no, no, no, don't jump yet.
[145:50.28]Did he jump?
[145:53.22]He did, didn't he?
[146:00.56]I wanted you to sit there and stay there so then when you knock the water around I could potentially climb up.
[146:12.01]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[146:13.52]No, you fucking followed me here, didn't you?
[146:20.02]Go back over there!
[146:26.67]Go!
[146:27.99]Get out of the water!
[146:35.37]I really do hope that we're going to need the helmet for something later on.
[146:40.78]Oh, there you go.
[146:41.44]Okay.
[146:44.15]Shake yourself off.
[146:52.65]Yeah.
[146:54.35]Okay.
[146:56.03]No, come on in.
[147:02.22]Alright, go.
[147:02.82]Jump in.
[147:05.32]Dunk me into a cookie.
[147:06.84]No, dunk... I'm the cookie.
[147:07.84]Dunk the cookie.
[147:08.42]No, he's the cookie.
[147:09.60]This is the glass of milk.
[147:10.94]You put too much milk in.
[147:16.63]You put too much milk in that fucking cookie dough.
[147:20.77]You stupid fucking wanker.
[147:25.14]Look at how fucking smart I am.
[147:30.40]You fucking wanker.
[147:42.59]Oh, that one felt good.
[147:43.75]Cinematic dive!
[147:48.79]Alright, Trico.
[147:50.37]Back over here.
[147:56.90]Swears?
[147:57.68]No, that wasn't a swear.
[148:01.46]I didn't take physics?
[148:02.80]What?
[148:03.52]I just did it!
[148:05.99]You're gonna have to give me more than a minute or two to figure these puzzles out, guys.
[148:09.49]I'm not a puzzle maniac.
[148:10.93]I'm a puzzle enthusiast.
[148:18.15]Alright, same deal.
[148:19.01]It's probably a place for you to swim now.
[148:23.42]Are you ready?
[148:23.90]Dive.
[148:29.24]Do that.
[148:31.04]Do it.
[148:33.68]What's it doing?
[148:36.24]It's not going anywhere.
[148:37.83]There we go.
[148:49.70]You should have solved puzzles five minutes before you get to them.
[148:52.74]God.
[148:59.25]We've been underwater for a long time.
[149:04.23]I'm dying down here.
[149:05.89]He's taking too long.
[149:11.49]I'm fucking dead!
[149:15.59]What?! !
[149:21.16]Oh, okay.
[149:22.42]What, did he, like, didn't know that I was still on him?
[149:26.60]Okay.
[150:02.63]Where did he go?
[150:03.27]Yeah.
[150:11.76]Is this the beginning of the game again?
[150:12.92]What is he doing?
[150:15.96]What's going on?
[150:30.49]Wait, do I want that elevator or this elevator?
[150:34.97]Ah!
[150:36.17]Hey, look at that!
[150:37.37]Gonna need a helmet here soon.
[150:41.63]I'm just gonna get in and see what happens, whatever.
[150:46.85]Alright, the right one.
[150:48.11]Yeah, this is a pretty good Dark Souls shortcut.
[150:54.14]Too many Dark Souls references.
[150:58.34]Gonna change our reference game up a little bit here.
[151:08.97]That's another one.
[151:17.78]Okay.
[151:19.66]Does this call another one down?
[151:25.14]Probably at some point.
[151:30.49]Well, I can't do it.
[151:32.79]There I go.
[151:34.61]Maybe that'll work.
[151:49.76]Alright.
[151:51.50]Slowly but surely.
[151:56.64]What's with the glowing lights?
[152:00.36]It's never really explained.
[152:01.66]You just kind of wake up with the dog.
[152:04.32]There's obviously some weird alien shit going on.
[152:08.12]Or some magic type of thing going on.
[152:15.74]There's all kinds of magic.
[152:18.31]Who knows?
[152:28.58]Shit's gonna break, I know it is.
[152:44.53]I know it.
[152:57.60]I left two hours and 38 minutes ago, and I'm still stuck on this, but I just got here.
[153:01.61]I just got here.
[153:05.73]Come on, guys.
[153:09.31]Quit being so nasty.
[153:19.99]If I had a trico, I would be able to get up there.
[153:47.49]You're being nasty.
[153:49.98]Okay, how many nasty boys and girls do we have in the chat, do you think?
[153:55.28]Probably a lot.
[153:56.06]There's probably a bunch of nasty guys and dolls here.
[153:58.88]I just want to see what happens here.
[154:03.23]This is going to break.
[154:03.81]Nope.
[154:09.05]Climb the chain.
[154:19.61]No, not me.
[154:21.21]I'm not.
[154:27.55]I still can't get over the fucking helmet catapult thing.
[154:32.66]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[154:34.54]I cannot believe it.
[154:49.91]No, I'm looking at chat.
[154:50.69]I gotta, like, not do that.
[154:53.59]I gotta pee, too.
[154:54.45]Is this the first pee?
[154:56.16]We're gonna do the first piss of the night?
[154:57.32]Because you know we're gonna be here for, like, another four hours.
[155:03.96]Keep going up, or... I guess I can't.
[155:13.35]Oh, shit.
[155:18.15]Okay, well, there he is.
[155:19.01]Trico, what did you leave me for?
[155:28.95]No, I gotta climb more moss?
[155:47.75]Alright, in B4, this is not Trico.
[155:49.53]This is the other one.
[155:52.66]That's my prediction.
[155:53.96]This is gonna be the other one.
[155:54.98]It's gonna fucking bite me.
[156:06.27]That's not the real me!
[156:07.79]You thought it was the real Trico!
[156:09.33]It's not!
[156:15.73]But I have to actually do things.
[156:21.77]Just wait till my friend gets here.
[156:26.49]Am I gonna have to trap him in one of those cages?
[156:33.32]Oh, of course you're gonna do that.
[156:42.12]I knew it.
[156:42.54]Get the rope!
[156:43.38]Get the rope!
[156:48.06]What are you doing?
[156:49.26]Boy, little boy.
[156:50.28]Yep, there it is.
[157:01.40]No, wait.
[157:01.92]I'm sick of it.
[157:03.36]I don't know what to do.
[157:05.56]I just gotta drop.
[157:11.19]That was a bad idea.
[157:12.71]Holy shit, that was a really bad...
[157:17.85]He knocked some sense into me.
[157:19.53]I had broken bones, but thank God they're not broken anymore.
[157:27.59]Alright, not that way.
[157:35.75]Not that way.
[157:36.31]We're not going that way.
[157:37.75]Oh, come on.
[157:39.65]Come on.
[157:48.59]Plus one joke yeah
[158:08.88]Look, I know.
[158:09.74]Look, I get it.
[158:10.52]I know.
[158:10.80]Sometimes you just don't understand what you need to be doing.
[158:13.72]You need to listen to me now.
[158:14.84]You need to stand there.
[158:15.74]Thank you.
[158:16.60]Thank you.
[158:16.92]Thank you.
[158:23.63]Oh, shit.
[158:24.03]Moss!
[158:25.45]Don't tightrope walk it.
[158:26.73]Are you stupid?
[158:29.01]I didn't even tell him to do that.
[158:33.91]He's playing Monopoly.
[158:50.44]Don't push the rock.
[158:59.76]Come on camera, don't make me do things I don't want to do.
[159:16.02]He's pretty close to me right now Dangerously chasing
[159:37.83]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
[159:41.03]Go back this way.
[159:43.20]Oh shit!
[159:45.02]Okay, I think I have to grab the ledge.
[159:46.02]When he comes this way, I gotta wake up.
[159:55.00]Right?
[159:56.25]Yep.
[159:57.85]Oh!
[159:58.69]Oh!
[160:00.69]Oh!
[160:11.68]Alright, I made it up.
[160:18.05]The means of escape.
[160:22.73]Can he get in here?
[160:25.67]I'm trying to get a good look.
[160:27.53]I gotta pee so bad, too.
[160:33.50]Can I jump from there?
[160:34.48]Let's just get down and look.
[160:40.32]Yeah, we can climb this.
[160:43.94]There's the ladder I need, you're right.
[160:50.76]Alright, I gotta drop the boulder on his head.
[160:56.89]Just like Super Mario!
[161:02.11]No, fuck!
[161:05.61]I thought I could grab that.
[161:15.51]Do it again.
[161:25.38]Here.
[161:29.46]No, he does it again, okay.
[161:31.18]Yeah, I think Wario's worse.
[161:40.07]Up or down?
[161:41.89]Up.
[161:49.08]Pogchamp to face palm in five seconds.
[161:52.42]No, good.
[161:52.90]I fucking beat Wario's Woods for the original Game Boy.
[162:05.83]Come on, you goofy little shit.
[162:22.14]I'm not sure which one.
[162:23.04]Door number one or door number two?
[162:24.22]Just go to door number two and see what's there.
[162:30.69]Cage.
[162:31.89]Yeah, good thing I didn't pick door number one, because look.
[162:35.07]Stop looking at it and go.
[162:38.09]A trade basket!
[162:41.76]No, it's a helmet!
[162:42.78]It's a helmet!
[162:45.36]It's a...
[162:49.82]It's a helmet!
[162:51.14]Give me the helmet!
[162:57.68]Now I'm just a hamster in a hamster wheel.
[163:08.03]Oh shit, do the hamster run!
[163:13.66]I gotta put the helmet on!
[163:18.27]Come on!
[163:20.94]Where's Trico?
[163:28.68]Okay, this is like... Wait, wait, wait, hold.
[163:32.76]What's he doing?
[163:34.38]What's going on?
[163:37.04]Huh?
[163:57.62]I knew I was gonna have to do a hamster.
[163:59.16]I'm like hurt again.
[164:05.47]Do I just roll this off the cliff?
[164:15.96]I gotta smash this thing open or something.
[164:22.53]Can I stand it up?
[164:29.66]Okay, well... Looks like we're going off the cliff.
[164:37.80]No, we're not.
[164:38.28]Over here?
[164:58.74]Alright, well.
[165:02.08]Doesn't seem to want to move anymore.
[165:10.68]Can this thing fucking roll?
[165:14.14]No, I was just supposed to be stuck in here.
[165:15.86]That's what I was supposed to do.
[165:31.66]Nice super monkey ball.
[165:36.72]Okay, so it just told me that.
[165:38.89]We did a cutscene just to put me back here.
[165:41.73]Wait, I think the cutscene was because I didn't do it right.
[165:48.45]It's gonna happen again, isn't it?
[165:53.33]Alright, I gotta get it over there.
[165:55.43]But how the fuck am I gonna get it over there?
[165:59.95]I need, like, a big running start.
[166:05.45]I don't think it's gonna... I mean, I'm gonna just try it right here.
[166:08.92]No.
[166:09.52]We're gonna get the cutscene again.
[166:15.60]Is it gonna do it again?
[166:16.88]I'm gonna say, oh, I fell asleep again.
[166:31.43]What if I just go off the cliff with this thing?
[166:37.34]I see a spot right there, but... What the fuck am I supposed to get that up there?
[166:45.08]This... Huh.
[167:01.29]Get the helmet.
[167:03.90]Yeah, the helmet is not going to do it.
[167:05.18]I can't even pick it up.
[167:09.74]Put the helmet on the catapult.
[167:21.17]Oh, come on.
[167:21.85]I'm so fucking close.
[167:22.83]It's like right here.
[167:36.94]I mean, that's the elevator, is it not?
[167:39.57]Yeah, so, like... My goodness.
[167:47.81]Was that scripted again?
[167:48.79]It was scripted again, guys.
[167:52.06]Like... It was scripted again!
[168:00.48]Here comes Drago!
[168:01.90]He heard me!
[168:08.81]There he is.
[168:10.90]He heard me.
[168:11.40]He was looking for me.
[168:17.18]He's here.
[168:18.56]Oh my god, I was looking for you.
[168:26.59]Can you get this open?
[168:33.89]Can you figure it out?
[168:35.21]Hit it.
[168:41.77]No, don't hit it, actually.
[168:42.97]Go that way.
[168:48.75]Push it with your face.
[168:56.96]If you can move me over there, we can get out of here.
[169:04.50]Yeah, yeah, that's where the other dog was sleeping.
[169:07.44]But you kind of can't worry about that right now.
[169:11.12]You need to worry about me.
[169:12.60]Your friend.
[169:18.85]Hey.
[169:23.71]Lookit.
[169:24.07]This is what you need to do.
[169:24.81]You need to move it.
[169:30.38]Yeah, well...
[169:40.08]Thanks for telling me that.
[169:41.14]Yeah, I want him to push it.
[169:42.53]Push it.
[169:43.59]Do it.
[169:44.59]Get in a position.
[169:51.03]Look, see?
[169:55.56]Hit it.
[169:57.30]Whack it.
[170:04.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.
[170:06.50]You got it.
[170:07.58]You got it.
[170:08.12]No, you don't got it.
[170:09.23]You don't got it.
[170:09.77]You almost had it.
[170:10.89]You almost had it.
[170:11.49]I'll give you credit.
[170:20.28]We're gonna be here for a while, I think.
[170:25.22]Almost.
[170:28.64]God, come on.
[170:34.34]I feel like making it flat would be easier for him.
[170:45.40]Yeah, you had it.
[170:46.68]Almost.
[170:52.91]Come on.
[170:56.25]Do it again.
[170:58.47]This time, push it a little bit harder.
[171:04.52]You're in the perfect spot.
[171:10.72]Not so perfect, actually, after all.
[171:12.30]I hope this is where I need to be going.
[171:15.29]It has to be.
[171:24.13]Whack it!
[171:31.42]Did it!
[171:32.48]Come on!
[171:39.02]You can do it.
[171:41.20]I know you can.
[171:47.09]God.
[171:50.47]Come on.
[171:57.36]No, no, you have the first time.
[172:29.11]The other dog pushed me.
[172:30.69]He just had it.
[172:34.79]I'm trapped in here.
[172:35.97]Don't you see?
[172:36.43]You have to run into it and smash it.
[172:45.29]Somebody's saying, please stop moving.
[172:46.59]Alright, I'm going to stop moving.
[173:03.26]Doesn't seem to be helping.
[173:04.30]Alright, you push this way.
[173:09.84]I'm not touching anything now.
[173:24.28]I waited here for what seemed like an eternity.
[173:28.49]Jump.
[173:28.77]Like, can you jump on it?
[173:33.35]Just, like, jump into it.
[173:35.37]Come on.
[173:35.63]That has to be it, right?
[173:41.96]All he's doing is, like, nudging it.
[173:42.96]I need to, like, move it around.
[173:54.65]It seemed like the more I was moving it, the more he actually cared about it.
[173:57.05]Alright, go.
[173:59.68]Come on.
[174:09.04]Alright, go.
[174:10.18]Roll it.
[174:15.18]I might be in a bad spot for his AI.
[174:17.60]Well... Oh!
[174:22.46]He did it!
[174:23.60]He did it!
[174:24.62]He actually did it!
[174:25.72]Look it!
[174:27.48]He fucking did it!
[174:29.90]Oh, no he didn't.
[174:31.08]I'm stuck.
[174:32.58]Yeah, keep going.
[174:42.49]Come on!
[174:43.87]The elevator's right there!
[174:48.13]Keep pushing it!
[174:49.81]Do it!
[174:53.48]This is so close!
[174:54.48]Here we go!
[174:55.04]No!
[174:56.48]No, no, no!
[174:57.40]No!
[175:06.51]Help!
[175:07.93]Oh, this sucks.
[175:08.77]Get me out of this fucking cave.
[175:19.95]Am I supposed to be down here?
[175:23.41]Oh, ow, shit.
[175:24.71]There you go.
[175:30.55]I fell down here.
[175:32.25]No, I guess I move it now.
[175:41.50]Open.
[175:41.78]I think it's open now.
[175:44.91]Is it open?
[175:47.11]No, of course it isn't.
[175:52.76]Now I'm all fucked up.
[175:54.72]That's good.
[176:02.34]I guess I'm just going to have to keep doing it myself.
[176:07.13]Until eventually we crash into the ground or something somehow.
[176:15.69]It's still not open.
[176:16.67]This thing is still closed.
[176:33.57]Aye, aye, aye.
[176:34.25]We're still in it.
[176:42.73]Get... I don't think I... I don't know if I should be doing this.
[176:46.89]I don't think I should have done that.
[176:47.89]Maybe I... Okay, no, I did.
[176:50.52]Cool.
[176:55.04]No, I... Okay, I get it.
[176:56.88]I just have to move it to the other one and it'll open because it's magic.
[176:59.32]Alright, come on, magic move.
[177:04.52]Come on.
[177:04.88]I have to get it to the other one.
[177:07.06]Don't roll off the cliff.
[177:14.01]Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[177:14.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[177:15.49]Easy, easy.
[177:19.09]Can you move... Oh, actually, I kind of don't want him to be over here.
[177:21.59]I need to be in a different position.
[177:31.06]Like that.
[177:34.83]Watch out, you.
[177:35.47]Got him in the way.
[177:42.42]Now, open.
[177:44.60]Oh, thank god.
[177:45.96]Helmet.
[177:50.32]Helmet.
[177:58.93]Oh, hold on.
[177:59.47]Fuck the helmet.
[178:00.21]Come here, you.
[178:00.83]Come here, you big goof.
[178:03.16]Come here, you big goofball.
[178:04.82]I need to say hi.
[178:08.70]I'm so glad to see you.
[178:14.61]Yes.
[178:15.73]Take a little nap.
[178:21.57]Hey.
[178:21.95]I have to go get more treats.
[178:23.25]Okay, hold on.
[178:24.31]I'm going to pee my pants.
[178:25.39]I'll be right back.

[183:06.92]Stupid.
[183:08.32]Dumb idiot guy.
[183:11.00]I waited for what seemed like an eternity.
[183:14.68]Alright, let me say thank you to Kawai Ebola Factory.
[183:19.65]Thanks for two months.
[183:21.27]King Llama and Nikasaurus.
[183:22.91]Thanks for the subs.
[183:23.55]And I think we're caught up.
[183:25.75]Or are we?
[183:27.71]No, Nikasaurus, didn't I?
[183:29.39]Did you?
[183:30.19]Did I?

[183:59.63]Master Toaster.
[184:02.28]You're going to keep throwing, Sam, you're going to keep throwing money at me until I beatbox?
[184:06.16]Not on stream.
[184:06.82]It's too embarrassing for me.
[184:08.66]I'm too shy.
[184:09.78]If I, like, can, I'll, like, do one and, like, play it for you.
[184:13.19]How's that sound?
[184:14.07]Not tonight, though.
[184:16.87]Master Toaster, again, thanks a lot.
[184:18.03]AJ Little for two months.
[184:19.97]I think we caught up at that point.
[184:21.21]But, Sam, thanks for the ten bucks.
[184:25.85]And during that whole thing, Nightscape also gave ten dollars.
[184:30.24]Thanks for the $10.

[184:31.78]Thanks for the $10.
[184:32.48]Thanks for the $10.
[184:32.84]And the Renegade Coaster.
[184:36.36]I waited here.

[184:37.56]Yes.
[184:38.32]Well, I'm back now.
[184:40.28]But my Trico is not in the room, so I gotta get him.
[184:44.00]Otto!
[184:44.16]Come here.
[184:46.76]Come here.
[184:47.90]Get in here.
[184:49.53]Get in here.
[184:50.57]Get in here and jump to the ledge.
[184:53.25]Jump over to the ledge, Otto.
[184:56.07]Oh, okay.
[184:56.55]I'll come back in a fucking hour and try the same thing and it'll work.
[185:01.23]Okay.
[185:03.17]You don't want to come in?
[185:07.61]He doesn't want to come in?
[185:09.59]That's okay.
[185:12.74]Alright.
[185:16.02]Helmet.
[185:18.64]Let's go get some traits.
[185:26.49]I think I can just bring this in.
[185:29.80]Where was that helmet guy?
[185:31.28]I don't even remember.
[185:32.20]I don't remember.
[185:36.26]Does anybody remember where that helmet guy was?
[185:37.92]Was he down here?
[185:39.36]Was he in here?
[185:40.02]Let's try in here.
[185:41.20]I feel like he was down here.
[185:51.58]Yeah, there he is.
[185:53.42]Alright, guys.
[185:54.72]Here we go.
[185:55.48]You guys ready?
[186:00.38]Oh man, I can't wait.
[186:01.54]I can't wait to see what happens.
[186:12.96]Turns into a bad guy.
[186:14.85]Turns into a fucking bad guy.
[186:19.03]Turns into a bad guy.
[186:19.99]Okay.
[186:23.46]Although, I think he might be too stupid to get up here.
[186:25.82]He is.
[186:27.15]So I'm gonna drag him all the way around here.
[186:32.07]Oh, of course he's a dumb spellcasting asshole.
[186:34.21]That's fine.
[186:35.77]Come over here.
[186:39.25]Get, like, stuck in this corner.
[186:40.72]This way.
[186:44.74]Come here.
[186:47.12]Get over here.
[186:47.64]Alright, now... Get it.
[186:54.54]Hope I can get it.
[186:59.96]Get it!
[187:01.30]Get it!
[187:05.65]Get it!
[187:16.26]Dammit.
[187:17.16]You asshole.
[187:20.06]Come on, do it again.
[187:20.84]I just have to actually pick it up this time, because he didn't want to pick it up.
[187:23.78]Apparently he didn't get it in the right spot or something.
[187:27.43]Come on.
[187:31.63]Yeah, good to see you.
[187:34.09]Fuck yourself.
[187:43.05]Shut up, bitch!
[188:03.05]Can I walk up one of these places?
[188:25.62]You bloody fucking idiot.
[188:35.05]Thanks for the treats.
[188:45.11]I just went to Pizza Hut and I got you your favorite little cereal and Pop-Tarts.
[188:50.44]Where's your Pop-Tarts, Mom?
[188:53.11]No, I didn't mean to do that.
[188:54.03]I'm sorry.
[188:54.85]I'm sorry.
[188:55.39]I'm sorry.
[188:56.65]I wanted to hit square.
[188:57.73]No, circle.
[188:59.64]Here, take it.
[189:02.58]Do you like to get pet when you eat?
[189:04.80]I know I do.
[189:05.44]Alright, you ready to leave?
[189:16.91]Take us home.
[189:24.87]Although I'm not really sure where that is.
[189:28.89]Where is home?
[189:31.99]Where?
[189:32.87]Over there?
[189:33.37]I think it's probably over there.
[189:42.80]Let's go back that way.
[189:43.56]I don't think you can make that jump, so let's go over there.
[189:52.52]Go for it.
[189:59.64]And I'm gonna jump to that platform and then that platform up there.
[190:03.05]Pop-tarts are really funny.
[190:08.81]No, that's like from a video I made like four years ago.
[190:15.21]And we go maybe up to there, I guess.
[190:17.14]Yeah, I think that's where he's going.
[190:21.35]And look, sometimes I don't even have to tell him what to do.
[190:24.09]Sometimes he just does it automatically.
[190:26.93]I didn't tell him to do this.
[190:28.27]His pathing and his AI just decides he's going to do the thing he's supposed to do.
[190:35.09]I can't say I really get it.
[190:37.03]But, you know, it's okay.
[190:38.71]Yeah, I know.
[190:39.15]You're a good dog.
[190:39.91]Alright, so... Keep going this way, man.
[190:49.63]Get places to jump, too.
[190:57.84]Up there.
[190:58.20]Let me know what you're doing.
[191:09.03]To that one.
[191:13.15]Do it all over again.
[191:21.68]You got this far.
[191:25.25]I know you can go to that one too.
[191:30.85]I think we're going to go up there.
[191:32.53]Are we going to go to the top?
[191:34.85]Yes, we are.
[191:42.40]You think this game could have been more interesting if you played as a dog?
[191:45.94]Yeah, I could see how a Yoshi's Island would be actually pretty fun.
[191:50.12]Remember in Yoshi's Island, if you got hit, then the little baby Mario falls off you?
[191:59.32]Maybe you have to take care of the kid.
[192:01.18]It's good either way.
[192:04.76]We're about to see that other animal, though.
[192:07.81]Somewhere over here.
[192:12.23]I bet we're going out that way.
[192:17.95]See, if this was a real animal, he would piss on that spot.
[192:21.50]Yeah, suddenly he's extremely intelligent.
[192:23.08]He knows exactly where he's supposed to go.
[192:29.53]I think that's the hole we're going out of.
[192:35.44]Or not?
[192:39.90]You have to assume, right?
[192:45.25]Out that hole.
[192:49.93]Huh?
[192:51.05]Huh?
[192:53.59]Huh?
[192:57.19]Do I have to go up there?
[192:58.55]No, wasn't I already up there?
[192:59.72]That's where I came from.
[193:04.96]Quickly, we'll be back soon.
[193:14.39]Oh.
[193:19.09]He's talking about the other animal.
[193:23.78]That's gotta be it, right?
[193:24.58]I mean, there wouldn't be a giant thing of light there.
[193:26.71]Like, that's where he came in, that's where he's gonna take me out.
[193:32.29]It might not be.
[193:33.65]We might have to play chess here for a minute.
[193:36.23]It's either that or I have to go all the way up there.
[193:47.50]We'll see.
[193:51.67]Uh...
[194:03.26]Right?
[194:03.76]Okay, so he's going to do it after all.
[194:11.19]He's getting ready.
[194:11.77]I would grab on, kid.
[194:13.75]Oh, man.
[194:14.29]I just got hurt.
[194:16.39]I just got clipped on the ceiling and I'm dead.
[194:28.46]Any treats?
[194:30.58]Nope.
[194:35.68]Nothing over there.
[194:36.78]Just keep going forward, then.
[194:37.82]Yeah.
[194:38.54]There's another spot, buddy.
[194:51.41]Do you want me to go that way, because there's vines?
[194:56.60]Looks like I can go there, but... I think we're just gonna jump.
[195:07.42]If he doesn't jump here in a minute, I'm going to just go on that path.
[195:09.45]I feel like maybe that's where I have to go anyways.
[195:12.77]Are you going to go for it?
[195:19.91]Maybe?
[195:22.96]Possibly?
[195:28.54]He's thinking about it.
[195:30.20]I don't think he has enough room.
[195:37.57]No, I don't know.
[195:38.11]I definitely have to go over there.
[195:41.51]Let's go play chess for a little while.
[195:57.71]Treat basket.
[196:10.34]Anything else I can do in here?
[196:11.16]This is an elevator.
[196:12.74]It's not active, though.
[196:13.52]I think that was just a trade-up here.
[196:18.49]Streamer Flasish?
[196:19.67]Wait, can I... Where is he?
[196:21.11]Right there?
[196:21.39]No.
[196:30.16]Why do I feel like I have to do something there?
[196:37.26]Alright, come eat this.
[196:38.62]And then, hopefully, you'll jump.
[196:51.66]No, I'm not gonna get... The only way I'll ever get caught, like, with my... I'm not even gonna say it.
[196:56.02]Why would I even say that?
[196:57.04]That's an extremely inappropriate thing to say.
[197:01.39]What's in here?
[197:07.71]I don't know.
[197:08.11]I kinda wanna... I kinda wanna see what's up here after I give the trade to him.
[197:13.06]Looks like there's stuff here.
[197:22.67]Freckle!
[197:24.80]Aha!
[197:25.00]Look what I got.
[197:26.16]Yes.
[197:29.24]Take it.
[197:33.75]You want me to just put it on the ground?
[197:35.71]Okay, go get it.
[197:36.43]I'll put it on the ground.
[197:39.40]No, he missed it.
[197:40.84]Go get it.
[197:51.10]No, I think he's too dumb to get it there.
[197:56.04]I can't do it.
[198:00.76]I want to see what's over here.
[198:02.32]That looks like a place I could scale.
[198:08.79]I can't really see anything.
[198:11.93]No idea where I am, but I'm doing something.
[198:20.11]Isai?
[198:20.57]Isai?
[198:51.58]Go for it.
[198:53.22]Take us out.
[199:00.02]Get us out of here.
[199:02.70]You didn't do it, dog.
[199:03.88]You didn't do it right.
[199:04.72]Maybe you'll get it this time.
[199:20.61]You have to see it.
[199:21.73]You can see it, right?
[199:25.72]He doesn't even see it up there.
[199:32.84]Do we go play more chess?
[199:35.10]Or do we keep playing checkers?
[199:36.22]What do you guys think?
[199:38.89]Checkers?
[199:49.24]Or chess.
[199:54.64]Checkers?
[199:58.06]Checkers?
[199:59.24]I'm calling the dog Checkers from now on.
[200:01.07]He's no longer Trico.
[200:07.15]Checkers?
[200:08.29]Hey!
[200:09.17]Checkers!
[200:18.84]I'm about to go play chess.
[200:21.24]There might be something in the other room I had to do.
[200:32.83]No, we... Checkers the dog.
[200:36.21]Checkers the dog, ladies and gentlemen.
[200:37.79]Checkers.
[200:40.56]Good job, Checkers.
[200:47.54]What's in here?
[200:51.01]And exit.
[200:51.51]I don't think there's anything else to care about.
[200:54.77]No, let's just get out of this hellhole, please.
[201:00.91]Checkers, let's go.
[201:10.40]Because I was on his head?
[201:11.18]I was on his back before.
[201:12.68]Alright, go that way.
[201:19.40]Let's go out there together.
[201:21.40]Or you can just follow me.
[201:23.02]Just follow me out there at this point.
[201:33.14]There it is.
[201:34.14]The final tower.
[201:39.59]Or who knows.
[201:40.05]Are we outside of the temple yet?
[201:44.39]I think we're in the temple forever.
[201:50.41]Well, I guess we just go that way.
[201:51.65]Anything over there?
[201:53.29]Nope.
[201:54.83]Alright, come on!
[201:57.43]Checkers!
[201:59.33]There's moss here, but... Eh.
[202:05.99]This is not what I need to be doing.
[202:07.13]I need to be on the... Oh, I'm gonna burp.
[202:14.51]I don't think you can get over here.
[202:15.61]No.
[202:16.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[202:16.94]Don't do it!
[202:17.84]Oh, he just hit me!
[202:19.81]Wait!
[202:20.61]Wait for me if you're gonna do that.
[202:27.44]Okay, NOW do it, whatever you wanted to do.
[202:29.56]Oh, do I have to climb the moss to get there?
[202:35.34]I don't think so.
[202:35.92]What a really weird spot, man.
[202:38.36]Up to there?
[202:40.30]Yeah, he has to jump up there.
[202:49.35]Get up there, man.
[202:57.55]He's aiming.
[202:58.89]He's aiming for it.
[203:01.11]Another jump.
[203:07.70]Yep.
[203:13.96]Another jump.
[203:16.92]Yep.
[203:22.43]We are scaling this very oddly.
[203:26.29]This is fucking really weird.
[203:28.17]That one now, I guess?
[203:34.98]Okay.
[203:36.74]Are we back where we were before?
[203:38.68]No, that's a different room.
[203:41.96]I see a place to climb.
[203:43.84]Good job, dog.
[203:45.02]I'll do some work here from now on.
[203:48.17]I'm just going for a speedy strat.
[203:51.20]Speedy strat.
[204:01.68]Thank God.
[204:04.96]Ow, my head.
[204:06.54]Fucking migraine.
[204:07.24]That was speedy.
[204:18.90]Hey, look, he got me to where I wanted to be.
[204:25.44]Hey, thanks, Vidiot.
[204:29.97]Vidiot, didn't you sub two days ago?
[204:34.23]A giant rat that makes all the rules thanks to the sub as well.
[204:44.88]It was a little too fast.
[204:46.02]It's okay, though.
[204:49.70]I hear another noise.
[204:55.77]I hear another dog noise.
[204:57.93]Get off.
[205:01.93]Stop.
[205:02.61]Let go.
[205:03.21]It's like caught on me.
[205:07.71]I see butterflies.
[205:08.45]That means there's a treat somewhere.
[205:14.82]This is the beginning of the game.
[205:18.16]Kind of doubling back to the very beginning.
[205:23.40]Not much rhyme or reason as to why we're doing any of these things.
[205:30.22]But I do need to open that door for him.
[205:35.46]Come on.
[205:35.90]Thank you every for the two months.
[205:54.23]Eight hours in, we're back to the beginning.
[205:58.75]I know.
[206:02.26]No, we just got the skip.
[206:04.20]We just got the Dark Souls skip.
[206:05.26]Remember when you go, you can skip Light Town?
[206:07.68]No, fuck.
[206:08.62]We were already in here.
[206:09.46]Didn't he hate this thing?
[206:11.72]We did this already.
[206:12.44]Or is this another one?
[206:18.57]No, this is another one.
[206:24.54]I guess this is just another one.
[206:27.30]Because there was a longer bridge on the other one.
[206:29.14]Wasn't there?
[206:38.27]Where is he?
[206:38.75]Oh, he doesn't like this.
[206:44.33]Well, I know I gotta do something here because he probably won't jump down.
[206:47.47]He probably will jump down if I get down there.
[206:51.95]I never finished Dark Souls 1.
[206:52.97]I can't make references to it.
[206:54.61]Why not?
[206:57.71]Here we go again, another cage.
[207:01.39]Here we go.
[207:07.45]Can I do anything right here?
[207:10.71]No, I can't.
[207:12.49]Oh, well, he's down here.
[207:15.23]Whoa.
[207:20.42]Not this again.
[207:27.35]Oh, it's giving him a headache.
[207:38.24]Oh!
[207:39.24]Now he's mad at me.
[207:42.84]How do I turn it off?
[207:47.32]Oh, boy.
[207:50.58]He's now going to try to kill me.
[207:52.84]Don't kill me.
[207:54.16]No, don't eat me.
[207:58.04]Um... Okay, there's a switch right there.
[208:03.70]What is that?
[208:04.84]Right here.
[208:11.53]Get up there!
[208:12.07]Son of a... Son of a... I gotta, like, climb.
[208:27.85]Can I not climb him when he's angry like this?
[208:30.31]I guess I can.
[208:30.81]I can't hold on to him.
[208:39.73]I shouldn't even think I should actually be able to jump.
[208:48.14]Here we go.
[208:49.34]Turn.
[208:49.80]Turn your body around.
[208:51.80]Turn you...
[209:04.78]No, I think that was supposed to happen.
[209:14.11]I think we're going to get a story here.
[209:51.12]What the hell is going on?
[210:40.90]What?
[210:46.48]You doofus, you're gonna burn us all down!
[210:48.32]What the fuck is happening right now?
[211:47.81]What is going on?
[212:41.77]I'm sorry, brother.
[212:44.74]I'm sorry, brother.
[213:25.58]Is this the end of the game?
[213:53.83]Superman 64, remember the rings?
[213:55.88]Told you this would be very similar.
[214:31.91]Okay, so this is the beginning of the game, but why does he have the chains on his neck?
[215:06.61]Who the fuck are these things?
[215:07.63]What are these things?
[215:30.16]Are these things even bad guys?
[216:25.09]Okay, so... Kinda still have no idea what the hell's going on.
[216:57.48]Are you still alive?
[217:51.58]Now where are we going?
[217:56.79]Oh shit, I gotta breathe through the left analog, you're right.
[218:20.90]Am I like... Is The Last Guardian one of these things where... I'm... Is it like the Airbender?
[218:29.04]Am I the Airbender now?
[218:30.47]Is that how I see it?
[218:34.33]Is this the prequel to Airbender?
[218:36.53]Avatar?
[218:38.37]I'm like the Guardian of the World now or something?
[218:46.55]Or am I just dead?
[219:15.08]This is like pretty terrible.
[219:24.11]Where are we going?
[219:31.21]To where it all began.
[219:48.94]Yeah, put me in the sun.
[219:49.76]That'll help.
[219:50.14]Yeah, I can't do anything.
[219:58.93]I think I'm just dead.
[220:19.72]I'm not controlling anything, no.
[220:29.42]All I can do is move the camera.
[220:40.79]This is so sad.
[220:41.57]He doesn't know what to do with me.
[220:43.43]He doesn't want me to be dead.
[220:44.51]Well, why did he eat me?
[220:53.54]Dunk me in the water.
[221:05.94]Oh, that worked.
[221:07.86]Oh, the cooling waters of life.
[221:12.54]Nice job, dog.
[221:16.87]Oh, yay.
[221:17.49]You did it.
[221:23.54]Come here, you.
[221:24.42]We're still both best friends.
[221:28.31]Come here.
[221:29.35]Come here.
[221:34.77]Oh, yeah.
[221:43.49]Okay.
[221:47.61]Well, now what do we do?
[221:52.61]I guess we could go back to where that was.
[221:55.84]That wasn't the end of the game, guys.
[221:59.28]We're still going.
[222:02.36]Didn't I go... Where was that room?
[222:07.60]I guess I'm going to go back to that room because the thing is not there anymore.
[222:10.88]Wait, is it still here?
[222:12.52]He's not going to freak out again, is he?
[222:17.14]Okay.
[222:17.40]Okay.
[222:22.38]What the hell do I do down here, then?
[222:32.14]I don't think there was a button I could press to open this.
[222:35.70]There's a ladder right there.
[222:36.67]I think it's closed now.
[222:41.17]I can climb that, but... What up top?
[222:46.89]Can you jump up there?
[222:48.03]I think you can jump up that.
[222:53.74]Yeah, we can get up there, right?
[222:55.46]That way.
[222:59.78]See, I'm still alive.
[223:00.52]You didn't kill me.
[223:02.48]I'm not sure how many more times you're going to have to eat me for the story to progress, though.
[223:10.63]There you go.
[223:31.99]Okay, climb down.
[223:34.61]That was a long cutscene too.
[223:54.51]What's going on in the chat?
[223:55.81]Do we have an argument here?
[223:59.96]Alright, I'm gonna have to stop this argument.
[224:01.28]Here we go.
[224:03.62]Cut it out.
[224:05.66]That's it.
[224:05.88]It means you have to stop.
[224:20.46]Cut it out.
[224:21.54]Cut it out.
[224:31.22]I want that disc again.
[224:32.16]Okay, another little mine.
[224:50.09]Lizard.
[224:51.33]Treat?
[224:52.49]Usually there's like a treat down here.
[224:55.89]No treat, huh?
[224:57.05]That's bullshit.
[225:05.36]It's probably something I could push down here.
[225:10.78]If I'm a smart boy, then I would say that would be the case.
[225:14.00]Can you, like, crawl in here?
[225:15.50]Can you stick your nose in here or something?
[225:18.02]No, not really.
[225:19.55]Oh, hold on.
[225:27.71]Okay, I guess he can get in here.
[225:33.19]Hey, yeah, you guys have it on your head.
[225:36.29]But yeah, that's kind of what I wanted you to do.
[225:38.63]Can you go a little bit further?
[225:39.71]I don't even need you to.
[225:46.17]Oh, hold on.
[225:46.93]Almost there.
[225:49.71]Almost there.
[225:52.13]There you go.
[225:53.11]Nice job.
[225:55.09]No, camera kind of screwed me up there.
[225:56.55]There you go.
[226:04.21]Oh, where am I?
[226:04.99]Oh, there we go.
[226:12.40]Let's open that door.
[226:27.79]I want to make sure I don't miss something.
[226:29.31]A treat basket or something.
[226:35.01]Let's just go.
[226:38.11]So he can do the same thing, right?
[226:39.39]Come on.
[226:40.79]Come down this one now.
[226:44.61]He's gonna just shimmy his way down the whole thing?
[226:46.55]Or can he even?
[226:58.30]Wait, are we in sub only right now?
[227:00.84]Why is there a war in the chat right now?
[227:03.14]We don't have wars.
[227:11.14]Uh-oh.
[227:17.10]R9K sub only.
[227:18.45]Oh, my goodness.
[227:19.43]What did somebody, like, what happened?
[227:20.37]Did somebody say, like, the game sucks and somebody, like, got pissed off?
[227:23.71]And then that person, like, was like, no, fuck you.
[227:25.31]You suck.
[227:26.21]Is that what happened?
[227:26.81]Am I kind of paraphrasing correctly?
[227:30.45]Yeah.
[227:32.86]Uh, what does this do?
[227:36.10]He can get the shit his way down here.
[227:40.43]Everybody calm down, everybody calm down.
[227:42.27]No, we don't do, we don't fucking shit talk.
[227:45.99]Here.
[227:46.17]The only person you're allowed to shit talk is me.
[227:52.36]That goes for sub or non-sub.
[227:54.34]I don't want like a chat with a bunch of people fighting over video games.
[227:56.94]No, if you want to say something bad, tell me that I suck.
[228:02.13]I don't want to have like political wars in this chat.
[228:04.35]No way.
[228:05.03]Not gonna happen.
[228:10.05]Can you squish down there?
[228:20.36]He can just like snake down here, can't he?
[228:22.38]Here he comes.
[228:25.42]Here comes the little snake dog.
[228:29.04]Come on, snake dog, you can do it.
[228:35.20]Wow, he's like a little mouse.
[228:37.01]He's just breaking everything.
[228:42.04]Come on.
[228:44.66]Come on.
[228:45.40]No, don't close it on him.
[228:54.80]You can do it.
[228:56.18]That must be so claustrophobic for him right now.
[229:06.91]Come on.
[229:09.45]You can't get your face through the rest of this?
[229:10.97]Yes, you can.
[229:14.84]Can he not?
[229:15.40]Oh, dog.
[229:19.84]Are you stuck?
[229:23.40]Oh, shit.
[229:23.88]He's stuck.
[229:26.24]Alright, hold.
[229:27.60]Hang tight right there.
[229:29.99]Oh, fuck.
[229:30.79]Uh-oh.
[230:01.54]Oh, geez.
[230:02.10]Oh, my goodness.
[230:11.23]I think he's still breathing.
[230:12.03]Don't wake her.
[230:18.41]Should I squish all the way down?
[230:19.39]I guess I can go out here now.
[230:35.60]Oh boy.
[230:40.12]You fucked this whole place up, dog.
[230:45.36]Let's go this way.
[230:58.21]Pet him back to life.
[230:59.11]I don't know what else to do back here.
[231:08.39]Maybe... Fuck.
[231:17.02]Where is he?
[231:17.44]Is he underneath?
[231:23.86]Oh, come on!
[231:26.94]Come on!
[231:30.77]Really?
[231:36.09]Oh, hold on.
[231:38.09]Come on.
[231:42.01]Oh, the frame rate.
[231:45.14]The frame rate.
[231:48.88]Get him.
[231:50.08]Get him.
[232:07.56]Nice.
[232:08.62]Good work.
[232:09.22]Now, calm down.
[232:12.86]Oh, I got a pet over my head, I think.
[232:21.13]I thought he was alive still.
[232:22.57]Calm down.
[232:24.63]Easy, easy.
[232:28.89]You want a spear in here or something?
[232:38.04]Dead?
[232:38.52]No, they're still going to die.
[232:51.27]I don't need more.
[232:56.57]I think I can rip their helmets off, but, you know, just let them knock them off the cliff.
[233:05.09]It's fine, too.
[233:09.53]Don't work.
[233:10.69]Okay, well, gotta help it.
[233:22.80]Oh, good dog.
[233:38.60]It's okay.
[233:44.74]Calm down.
[233:48.92]Let me take care of those wounds.
[233:53.96]Hold on.
[233:54.34]I need to take care of those wounds.
[233:58.06]Holy shit, I can't see a thing.
[234:08.41]Oh, we got another outdoor area.
[234:10.15]Wait, we got to cut anywhere else?
[234:11.21]Let me see.
[234:12.87]I think you have to... Nope.
[234:22.89]No.
[234:23.45]Alright.
[234:25.70]We're just moving along.
[234:26.72]I imagine they actually released this on the PS3.
[234:32.92]That would be unimaginably terrible if this was on PS3.
[234:39.26]He's gearing up.
[234:42.19]That doesn't seem safe.
[235:01.20]Not much further.
[235:02.10]Oh, shit.
[235:03.18]I have to let go.
[235:05.22]Guys, look.
[235:05.70]Look what's in front of us.
[235:07.94]Oh!
[235:14.19]Wait.
[235:17.01]Wait.
[235:18.32]What?
[235:31.86]It's okay.
[235:41.89]Not okay.
[235:42.29]I almost just jumped up.
[235:57.65]Alright.
[235:59.45]We can turn off sub-mode now.
[236:01.63]Sub-mode can commence.
[236:06.88]Bring back the freedom.
[236:08.64]I don't want to look over and see people talking shit to each other.
[236:12.54]We don't do that here.
[236:17.40]Just be nice.
[236:34.36]Not much further.
[236:40.06]The gates of hell have opened.
[236:43.22]That was a little bit further than I thought.
[236:44.46]I almost didn't make that.
[236:49.24]Okay... Can I walk up this?
[236:59.54]No way.
[237:05.50]Is this actually working?
[237:10.36]That's... That was working.
[237:14.96]That was working.
[237:15.67]I just found this.
[237:16.25]Okay.
[237:16.95]People are going to refer back to this channel.
[237:20.07]When they find the strats and the skips.
[237:21.55]They're going to find that.
[237:23.35]That was it.
[237:23.69]Then they're going to have to credit me.
[237:27.38]I can just wait until, like, the biggest speedrunner is gonna be like, Yeah, well, we found this trick.
[237:30.80]Uh, Jerma985 was, uh, streaming.
[237:32.60]He's a fucking idiot.
[237:33.80]And he thought you could, like, walk up this banister.
[237:36.38]But, uh, turns out, like, no normal, like, human being would try that.
[237:39.76]But, uh, Jerma985 did, and, uh, that's it.
[237:41.73]We gotta credit him for that.
[237:48.27]Okay.
[238:05.06]Oh, shit!
[238:07.02]Fucking coffee everywhere.
[238:08.24]The stupid headphones.
[238:13.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what to do.
[238:16.92]See?
[238:18.17]Guess I thought I didn't have the strategy right here.
[238:19.65]The strategy was just to fail it, and then... jump to it again.
[238:28.07]God damn it.
[238:28.55]Alright, do it right this time.
[238:29.43]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[238:40.98]I'm trying to go faster, but I really shouldn't be.
[239:02.84]Down that way, and... How the fuck do I get up here?
[239:12.84]Just keep going this way.
[239:22.10]I wonder if they'll speedrun this game.
[239:28.50]What's with chat today?
[239:29.94]Everyone's freaking out.
[239:33.52]Come on, I'm just trying to learn the routes.
[239:44.17]Keep going around?
[239:45.13]Eventually can I get up?
[239:51.70]I mean, for some reason I feel like I can do that.
[240:05.15]I guess I can try going this way.
[240:06.85]See what happens.
[240:08.35]Looks like there's a spot for me to climb.
[240:18.48]Don't.
[240:18.96]Easy, man.
[240:19.48]Am I right?
[240:28.61]Does that look like something I can do?
[240:32.67]Kind of.
[240:33.97]Where the hell is this going to take me, though?
[240:47.62]Ah.
[240:49.97]I don't think I need to do this, but for some reason there's a ledge here for me to do this with, and I'm just going to go for it and see what happens.
[241:02.21]It's a long way to go around, too.
[241:03.61]I hope this is right.
[241:12.72]I'm just praying this is going to lead all the way around eventually.
[241:19.19]It's gonna be a secret treat.
[241:22.25]It's a long jump.
[241:23.61]Don't fuck this up.
[241:27.82]Almost fucked it up.
[241:28.56]I can feel my fingers flipping off triangle.
[241:29.96]God damn it.
[241:37.70]I don't know if this is where I need to go.
[241:47.33]Ugh, it's just, I don't wanna fuckin' help.
[241:49.63]I don't wanna fuckin' help.
[241:59.69]God, it's blown out.
[242:00.87]Jesus!
[242:07.09]Alright, my hands are greasy.
[242:12.48]I gotta wipe them off.
[242:20.47]I don't like how the camera is running.
[242:21.85]This is s'more.
[242:23.42]There's s'mores.
[242:24.12]There's chocolate.
[242:24.74]There's Hershey's chocolate.
[242:26.68]There's peanut butter.
[242:28.14]There's marshmallow.
[242:30.22]And topped it off with a graham cracker.
[242:31.76]Jesus Christ.
[242:36.42]They're getting further away.
[242:37.72]The jumps are getting further away.
[242:39.39]Look at how far away this is.
[242:44.59]Okay.
[242:49.43]I'm still going around.
[242:51.57]This has to be the end, right?
[242:55.76]Okay, good.
[242:56.62]Just don't blow this.
[242:58.98]Hold on, my hands are fucking covered in juice.
[243:02.82]I have, like, such juicy hands right now.
[243:10.31]Peanut butter on s'mores?
[243:11.23]Yeah, why not?
[243:22.05]Tryko could make these jumps.
[243:23.93]Yeah, but those stupid eyeball things are making him so he can't come over here.
[243:31.79]Alright.
[243:32.39]We can breathe a sigh of relief.
[243:35.30]It seems.
[243:37.58]There's a way to go down there, but no.
[243:39.24]Screw that.
[243:39.74]I'm not going to get myself in any more trouble.
[243:41.16]Just push the eyeballs off.
[243:42.18]Let's complete the story.
[243:45.60]This is so bright.
[243:48.54]I gotta get out of here quick because I cannot look at this for much longer.
[243:58.68]I'm not gonna pee again.
[244:04.75]Jump off the side as a joke.
[244:10.83]Well, you might see that, because I probably have to do something here.
[244:26.50]It's gonna break, isn't it?
[244:28.40]It's gonna snap all over the place.
[244:38.29]Slow it down.
[244:44.85]Push this one.
[244:54.99]What is going on right now?
[244:59.59]What is happening?
[245:05.24]Hello?
[245:06.80]Hello?
[245:10.08]Get him off me!
[245:20.89]Nothing works!
[245:31.38]No, this is... I can't do anything.
[245:32.46]It's over.
[245:34.50]Was I not fast enough?
[245:35.98]Oh, that's the king!
[245:38.74]That must be the king antelope.
[245:40.87]There's like fucking 200 of them!
[245:50.84]Are you shitting me?
[245:59.37]It's too many of them!
[246:14.50]Where are we going?
[246:20.80]There's nowhere to go.
[246:24.16]We're gonna crash down again.
[246:25.48]We're going to smash again.
[246:28.52]This motherfucker can fly now.
[246:33.12]He can fly.
[246:34.98]No, you don't!
[246:38.66]I feel like I might have something to do there.
[246:50.73]Do I have to get up?
[246:51.31]I think I have to choose.
[246:52.49]Yeah, I have to jump over here.
[246:57.37]I'm trying, I'm trying to figure out what I need to do here, dog.
[246:59.31]Huh?
[247:00.55]Oh, quit!
[247:04.56]What did that do?
[247:22.58]Come on.
[247:24.72]Where'd he go?
[247:26.46]Oh, shit.
[247:29.28]Shit, shit, shit.
[247:32.04]What do I do here?
[247:33.02]I need to jump from there to there.
[247:34.56]This is gonna be a skill jump.
[247:37.53]What the fuck do I do now?
[247:39.71]From here to there?
[247:52.26]Come on.
[247:55.80]You gotta get me in your mouth, dog.
[248:00.12]Okay, we're safe.
[248:10.39]I think I gotta get in the building.
[248:11.67]No, what?
[248:12.19]What happened here?
[248:12.77]Didn't I pull the switch?
[248:14.61]Am I gonna pull the switch again?
[248:18.69]I think I do.
[248:22.23]It's hard to climb up his head when he's doing this.
[248:30.60]Son of a... God damn it.
[248:33.14]That was so awkward trying to climb his head.
[248:38.12]It just wouldn't let me do it.
[248:40.68]Aye, aye, aye.
[248:44.41]It's fine.
[248:53.01]Did he actually get in?
[248:59.63]No, not again.
[249:04.36]No, he actually got in.
[249:12.06]What do I do?
[249:15.70]Okay, you ready?
[249:17.16]One, two, three.
[249:18.44]Good catch.
[249:27.43]You know, they've done that a couple of times.
[249:43.79]So we're just going to fly away at the end.
[249:47.75]Okay.
[250:10.16]We were so close.
[250:12.22]You blew it, dog.
[250:13.26]You blew it.
[250:15.54]But I still love you.
[250:18.10]Let's keep going.
[250:21.78]Uh...
[250:39.36]Okay, Draco, I think you can potentially jump to this stuff.
[250:44.34]Come on, dog.
[250:45.58]Did I play Shadow of the Colossus?
[250:47.64]Yes, I did.
[250:49.70]I was a big fan of that game.
[250:52.80]It was quite a good game.
[250:53.94]Alright.
[251:07.07]Let's move.
[251:16.24]You can do it.
[251:23.08]What's your plan, dog?
[251:24.58]Do you have one?
[251:28.05]Do you have a plan?
[251:29.51]Checkers, come on.
[251:32.43]No?
[251:34.23]You don't want to get out of here, checkers?
[251:35.57]Should I just jump down?
[251:37.81]What's stopping me from just jumping down?
[251:39.25]I don't know.
[251:40.07]Can I just walk that way?
[251:41.73]Forget about jumping.
[251:43.77]Just go down.
[251:55.40]Well, that's a long way down.
[251:57.85]Okay, well.
[252:14.59]Can't survive that one.
[252:15.85]Can't survive that fall.
[252:19.13]Let's go down here.
[252:27.59]There are treats down here.
[252:35.61]Gate.
[252:41.74]What else is down here?
[252:59.95]Ah, that got me good.
[253:00.97]I like that one.
[253:06.27]Well, it'd be nice if he did fly or jump.
[253:08.39]Instead of me having to see if I have to do it first.
[253:17.16]This is closed.
[253:18.28]Okay.
[253:20.96]Back up we go.
[253:38.00]Okay, what about, yeah, camera.
[253:42.20]Alright, let's try and get him to do it again, I guess.
[253:47.82]Come with me.
[254:00.16]You think he would just jump to right there?
[254:11.62]Let's try this again and see if he does it.
[254:12.90]And if he doesn't, then I'm gonna go back down.
[254:20.29]Seems like he should just easily just jump right there.
[254:27.73]Hmm?
[254:40.22]Go underneath the gate?
[254:48.27]Please let go.
[254:49.91]Please just let go of him.
[254:57.14]Was there a place for me to go under the gate?
[254:58.44]Oh, well.
[255:01.44]Maybe there was.
[255:05.28]He can't open his wings down here.
[255:06.66]Well, whatever.
[255:07.34]We'll go back down and see.
[255:10.54]Oh, wait.
[255:10.78]What about up here?
[255:19.92]We can go further up.
[255:31.07]Well, we're even further up than we were before.
[255:36.10]That's certain death.
[255:40.14]Should we go up higher or take a look out here?
[255:49.79]Treat basket!
[255:50.31]Look what I got.
[255:52.17]Let me see if there's anything even for those.
[255:57.40]Okay, there.
[256:00.86]Yeah, this is it.
[256:03.36]You need that treat, don't you, dog?
[256:04.88]This is going to be a really annoying far walk down to him.
[256:41.81]I'll be down in a minute.
[256:44.11]I'll be there shortly.
[256:46.61]Throw it, but no.
[256:47.29]I don't want to... I threw it.
[256:50.73]Hey, look.
[256:52.87]Doesn't even matter.
[256:55.48]See?
[257:00.36]See?
[257:03.92]Look at that.
[257:11.91]Where is he?
[257:12.29]Come on.
[257:13.69]Come here.
[257:23.37]It's right here, man.
[257:24.05]Come on.
[257:27.46]Shadow of the Molasses.
[257:34.20]I love you guys.
[257:35.04]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[257:37.08]Shadow of the Molasses.
[257:38.30]That's what this game is called.
[257:45.22]Alright, now I just want to take a look down here again.
[257:53.09]Speedrun.
[257:54.28]Come on, what are we thinking?
[257:58.36]Speedrun.
[258:21.62]Don't think I can fit under this.
[258:30.49]You know, there was a lot of people in the chat screaming at me that I didn't do that.
[258:51.30]Yeah, there was a bunch of people that were screaming at me to fit underneath that.
[259:08.62]So first you guys told me to throw the barrel and it didn't do anything.
[259:10.74]It rolled down the stairs and then I can't fit underneath the thing.
[259:12.88]It's getting screamed at.
[259:21.28]Alright, now we should be able to jump because he had his breakfast.
[259:24.20]Let's go.
[259:28.63]Let's go, breakfast dog.
[259:29.65]That way.
[259:40.89]Go on.
[259:48.50]Down and beat it to a slide dash.
[259:55.93]Keep going.
[259:57.77]Yeah, you gotta keep going, man.
[260:10.10]Don't do this to me again, dog.
[260:17.17]Just walk out there.
[260:21.19]Oh my goodness.
[260:24.13]I even gave you a treat, too.
[260:25.23]You just don't want to listen.
[260:31.73]Come on.
[260:33.95]I mean, maybe I could just drop down.
[260:35.93]Less annoying.
[260:39.41]Get out here.
[260:46.13]Will you do it now?
[260:57.02]Should I, like, jump to one of these ledges or something?
[260:58.84]Stop moving your head around so much, man.
[261:16.78]What?
[261:17.88]Where's the camera?
[261:20.40]I think I might just fucking jump forward again from his head.
[261:22.32]Yeah, fuck this.
[261:25.96]Yeah, fuck this.
[261:26.72]I just shattered his shinbone.
[261:28.94]It's okay.
[261:33.32]Oh, now you decide to come down.
[261:35.24]Now you decide to come down.
[261:36.46]Hey, welcome to the party.
[261:38.68]Welcome to the party.
[261:39.34]I'm glad I had to just break all my bones for you to understand to jump down here.
[261:46.02]And that was what we were supposed to do.
[261:52.03]R1 plus triangle to jump.
[261:54.11]I know.
[261:54.55]I've been doing that the entire game.
[261:56.43]This triangle.
[261:58.77]Trust me.
[261:59.63]Trust me.
[262:00.23]I know the controls by now.
[262:05.79]Alright, let's do it.
[262:18.94]Please learn the commands, you guys.
[262:21.96]I do this every fucking time I want him to jump.
[262:25.44]I know how to make him jump.
[262:27.22]It's just sometimes he doesn't do it.
[262:29.66]Oh god, here we go.
[262:30.60]Now we're gonna just keep saying it.
[262:32.70]There you go.
[262:39.79]You leave the left stick to move.
[262:46.83]Where are you going?
[262:47.73]What are you doing?
[262:49.79]What are you doing?
[262:50.87]Why would you come over here?
[262:51.69]He smells.
[263:11.65]He smells something.
[263:12.69]Easy.
[263:18.35]Anywhere over here to jump to I don't think so
[263:46.86]Easy.
[263:47.26]Getting flashbacks of the other place we were.
[264:00.49]How about the other side of this?
[264:09.91]We go down there?
[264:10.59]I don't have any fucking idea.
[264:16.83]Jump to the waterfall.
[264:20.11]Come here, yo!
[264:20.93]We gotta go!
[264:21.43]Helmet on ledge.
[264:36.99]Now where you going?
[264:47.93]I'm not sure.
[264:49.51]He seems to have his own agenda right now.
[264:54.17]Is that down there?
[265:02.99]Up there?
[265:04.09]Can you jump up there, dog?
[265:05.48]It looks like a little platform we can get to over there.
[265:08.16]Doesn't that seem correct?
[265:16.06]Can he even fit up there?
[265:29.04]Is there an opening right here?
[265:34.53]I think I can get in there now.
[265:45.87]I wish I could climb you.
[265:55.22]I couldn't even see in there if there was a place to go in or not.
[265:59.61]No, it's not.
[266:05.11]I mean... But if we get there, there's not really a place to... Maybe, like, over there?
[266:09.51]There's nothing there.
[266:20.54]I'm so scared of this game and ledges and shit just because I don't know what the hell he wants to do.
[266:24.56]Like, what about, like, through there?
[266:34.72]Okay, we're on this ledge now.
[266:38.89]Yeah, this is where I wanted to go.
[266:40.83]One more.
[266:44.19]Come on.
[266:45.01]You know you can do it.
[266:45.97]Right up there.
[266:50.19]That one.
[266:52.45]Jump.
[266:54.85]Come on.
[267:00.59]I figured it out.
[267:01.63]I gotta jump to that one.
[267:04.25]Oh, but I'm not sure.
[267:06.62]I might not have to do that.
[267:08.74]Should I?
[267:10.30]I don't know.
[267:10.86]I have no idea.
[267:13.92]Where do you want me to go?
[267:15.22]That one?
[267:15.64]Oh, okay.
[267:17.54]I'll get down.
[267:18.20]I'll get down.
[267:18.66]That's a good idea.
[267:19.36]I'm going to go this way now.
[267:22.40]Oh, that was good.

[281:40.05]The other side.
[281:47.60]Okay, please, game.
[281:49.32]What does this one do?
[281:57.98]Well, I obviously... I gotta chop his, like, tail.

[282:39.24]Shit.
[282:43.72]I can't even see.
[282:46.07]Oh no, that's far.
[282:48.57]That's far.
[282:51.01]That's far.
[282:58.78]What's next?
[282:59.52]What am I looking at?
[283:01.48]What is it doing?
[283:02.52]Okay.
[283:03.22]Yeah, alright, so I gotta drop that.
[283:08.31]He's gonna use Ass Kick, right?
[283:15.61]Other side.
[283:16.43]There's nothing on this side.
[283:19.87]Of course not.
[283:20.73]Other side.
[283:22.57]Shit, this is bad.
[283:40.16]Quick.
[283:42.86]Just drop this little thing on his head.
[284:13.92]I hope this doesn't crush my dog.
[284:15.38]Alright, get him.
[284:16.42]Get him.
[284:17.24]Nice, headshot.
[284:18.42]Wait, no, that, who, who's who?
[284:44.94]Okay, he's got the armor on.
[284:48.26]That's the bad one?
[284:58.60]No!
[285:01.81]Shit!
[285:02.65]Broke another knee.
[285:03.83]Broke another shinbone.
[285:06.99]No!
[285:11.47]Huh?
[285:12.13]Hey!
[285:14.24]Hey, shit!
[285:17.94]No!
[285:19.50]You motherfucker!

[285:27.39]No!
[285:29.33]Recover!
[285:30.13]Come on, hurry the fuck up!
[285:31.36]Alright, how can I get down there faster?
[285:37.16]Without dying?
[285:43.84]I could just jump, but that's a stupid idea.
[285:51.07]Still this one asshole over there.
[285:52.45]Is that gonna kill me if I fucking fall?
[285:57.79]I'm gonna fall on top of him.
[286:01.41]I feel like I'll be okay if I do that.
[286:17.88]Come here, dog.
[286:21.81]Where are the spears?
[286:22.77]There's the shield.
[286:37.36]Let me take care of him first.
[286:53.61]Okay, does he have a spear in him too?
[286:56.01]Somewhere back here.
[287:02.57]Give him a belly rub.
[287:11.34]This guy has got his fucking ass kicked.
[287:16.84]We both have just got this shit kicked out of us the whole entire game.
[287:25.84]Where's the spear?
[287:26.44]I knew there was a spear in him.
[287:31.67]Well, we'll deal with that in a second.
[287:32.67]Give me the disc.
[287:35.67]There's like a lizard underneath him.
[287:58.82]Does he want me to zap something?
[288:10.97]Zap the train?
[288:12.03]The choo-choo train?
[288:18.10]What about down here?
[288:20.98]He needs some more batteries.
[288:22.00]He's out of batteries.
[288:44.86]Because he can even... What does that do?
[289:00.61]Oh, there was a trait there.
[289:06.57]Somebody just said I have the worst logic?
[289:09.75]I just did what I needed to do.
[289:11.12]I had to shoot the fucking train.
[289:26.52]Here.
[289:26.70]Is this going to make you feel better?
[289:28.24]Will this wake you up?
[289:29.44]Okay.
[289:32.72]There.
[289:32.96]Go on.
[289:33.20]You can get it.
[289:33.60]Right in front of your face.
[289:35.31]Oh, damn it.
[289:36.31]Hold on.
[289:37.09]I get it.
[289:37.43]I can do it.
[289:42.15]Come here.
[289:42.75]Can you get it out of my hand?
[289:45.85]Go on.
[289:46.05]You can do it.
[289:46.35]Go on.
[289:47.55]There.
[289:47.87]Good boy.
[289:48.40]I think there's another one back here, too.
[289:57.58]Is there another one?
[290:01.10]Is he getting up?
[290:03.88]Sort of.
[290:04.91]What about your wing?
[290:11.91]Your wing's a little screwy right now.
[290:13.69]No, I don't want to do that.
[290:21.55]What is he eating?
[290:22.31]I don't think we ever figured that out.
[290:23.43]Yeah, there's one more right there.
[290:33.22]Yeah, I knew there was another one.
[290:34.98]I just wanted to... Somebody mentioned his wing, so I was like, yeah, maybe I'll look at it.
[290:39.81]Jeez.
[290:40.77]Can't take fucking five seconds.
[290:56.22]How you doing?
[290:58.50]You doing good?
[291:02.38]That was good.
[291:12.69]Any others?
[291:16.59]Fell from there.
[291:25.15]Any more snacks?
[291:25.97]I might have to go get them another once from another place.
[291:33.67]Oh, there's butterflies flying around.
[291:39.29]There I go.
[291:43.45]Need another one?
[291:44.03]I think he needs another one.
[291:55.06]There might be one the other way.
[291:58.21]Jumpstart him?
[291:59.01]Does it make him zap himself?
[292:04.75]Oh, did I miss one?
[292:05.61]I don't think I missed one.
[292:13.36]There's probably one in the other room.
[292:15.20]Just gonna get a big view of this whole place to make sure I didn't miss something.
[292:26.02]Oh, it'll go here.
[292:26.62]Can you shoot that for me?
[292:27.80]No.
[292:43.17]Probably just have to go down here.
[292:44.11]There's probably something this way.
[292:49.29]Let's look in here.
[292:50.09]Any treats?
[292:57.86]This way?
[292:58.34]Let's just take a look.
[293:08.00]Don't fall in the hole.
[293:18.32]no it's definitely something in there I guess I could climb that is there anything what about that you want to zap that
[293:49.88]Treats?
[293:54.58]No treats?
[293:56.62]Come on.
[294:01.64]I guess I can climb up here now.
[294:05.03]Or can I?
[294:35.55]Yeah, the butterflies are flying up here.
[294:36.75]There's definitely one up here.
[294:39.33]Definitely.
[294:42.23]There's two.
[294:44.93]Well, we're going to bring them back to life.
[294:52.51]Hi.
[294:56.44]There's one.
[295:00.08]Here's two.
[295:07.20]I'm not gonna hit him with one of these.
[295:08.46]That feels terrible if I hit him.
[295:13.34]Okay, let's... I was gonna just jump down there, but dying right now would be so stupid.
[295:21.99]So I'm gonna climb the chain.
[295:23.11]At least for a little bit.
[295:32.43]It almost was bad.
[295:33.67]Get ready for a bullseye.
[295:35.89]No, he's fine.
[295:46.11]Two more for you.
[295:49.87]Good.
[295:57.45]Oh, yeah.
[295:58.53]It's so good.
[295:59.28]I love these mystery barrels that we don't know what they are.
[296:03.58]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[296:17.97]Is it good?
[296:21.19]Come on, eat it.
[296:24.29]Come on.
[296:26.27]Oh.
[296:29.24]Good job.
[296:33.80]Alright.
[296:39.26]Now we get out.
[296:41.53]Or try to.
[296:50.16]I call it essence of the butterfly.
[297:05.56]Oh, how adorable.
[297:16.61]Are you ready to fly?
[297:52.24]Whoa!
[297:56.53]Are you ready to get out of here, dog?
[298:06.43]Let me fix you up for a second.
[298:11.31]Isosai?
[298:19.14]Isosai?
[298:24.83]You got wounds all over you, man.
[298:27.45]I saw, I saw.
[298:33.38]There's another one up here.
[298:34.56]I saw, I saw.
[298:39.38]There's like two more.
[298:42.74]On his butt.
[298:51.86]I saw, I saw.
[298:53.54]Esau Esai.
[299:01.29]One more on your neck, but I don't think you're going to let me get it.
[299:03.13]I think you're just going to move.
[299:07.05]Are you?
[299:07.35]What are you doing?
[299:17.05]Well, you made it to here.
[299:17.81]Good job.
[299:22.36]I can't wait till we fly out of here and the credits roll.
[299:29.18]Oh, get that motherfucker.
[299:32.33]Fucking kill that guy.
[299:37.33]Smash that guy's fucking face in.
[299:52.21]Do I have to jump to that or something and try to roll down?
[299:59.14]I feel like I have to jump to that.
[300:01.56]Is it going to let me?
[300:08.17]Punk.
[300:08.45]I'm just going to see what happens if I jump.
[300:10.35]Nope!
[300:17.05]Oh, I forgot I have the shield.
[300:18.69]I have the fucking shield.
[300:19.81]I haven't had it for the whole game.
[300:21.03]I just didn't even remember.
[300:25.94]I haven't had this the entire game up until like the last 15 minutes.
[300:30.36]Kill him.
[300:44.16]why do people watch a stream of somebody so incompetent in video games I don't know man like I just needed to figure it out I like forgot I had the disc I haven't had the disc for nine hours well the real question is why are you here watching I'm not so certain at this point
[301:21.90]A lifetime ban.
[301:22.89]No, I wanna take the shield off.
[301:30.21]Stop petting his head.
[301:30.89]Please.
[301:35.57]Take out the shield.
[301:36.35]I would appreciate it if you just, you know, took it off.
[301:38.45]I have to be on the ground, I think.
[301:43.42]Don't even fucking do that.
[301:44.92]Come on, man.
[302:04.92]Keep going.
[302:12.08]Get us out!
[302:20.16]Any more people throwing spears?
[302:21.48]Well, you know what to do with that.
[302:36.19]Shoot it.
[302:38.87]Oh, camera.
[302:39.97]Not doing me any favors.
[302:40.91]Alright, I'm gonna have to get off him, I think.
[302:46.85]Oh, the camera just keeps fucking with me here.
[302:59.06]You would get out of the way, man.
[303:07.05]You're fine, walk it off.
[303:14.09]I can't seem to aim it when I'm on his back.
[303:15.45]God, this fucking camera.
[303:18.91]My god.
[303:35.42]Tamerman is fired.
[303:44.60]Can we get in there?
[303:46.48]There's something I have to do when we get in there.
[303:48.36]Go that way.
[303:56.90]I don't want to jump to there.
[303:57.84]You have to jump to there, man.
[304:00.44]If I jump, I get hurt.
[304:01.46]If you jump, you stay fine.
[304:02.79]I guess he can't.
[304:03.37]Is it going to be dangerous?
[304:08.61]Well...
[304:16.47]Can I just jump to that?
[304:17.69]I think I can.
[304:19.87]Make sure I don't fucking kill myself here.
[304:26.33]I'm gonna jump to the longest ledge.
[304:29.95]Pray for me!
[304:36.25]Thanks for the prayers.
[304:37.37]Appreciate it.
[304:42.12]He can jump over here.
[304:43.18]He could jump over here.
[304:44.76]He just didn't want to.
[305:03.61]Oh, what's really left?
[305:05.55]Another one of these.
[305:06.47]He's gonna eat me again, isn't he?
[305:11.61]Okay.
[305:16.53]Yeah, here we go.
[305:17.25]Here comes the end.
[305:18.39]We're probably at the end of the game.
[305:19.79]He's gonna fucking eat me again, and we're gonna see another cutscene.
[305:27.53]It's...
[305:33.37]Here we go.
[305:37.19]Oh, I just forgot I hate you.
[305:41.43]We're looking right at the exit.
[305:48.56]We could have been free.
[305:50.96]Look.
[305:52.21]We would have been free.
[306:03.14]Come on, you know what to do.
[306:05.50]You know what to do.
[306:08.12]Eat me.
[306:08.28]Or is he... What is he doing here?
[306:16.26]Do we just have to let him... Eat it, or do we not have to let him eat me?
[306:25.53]I'm gonna fucking zap it.
[306:27.33]Will he still listen?
[306:33.11]I don't think he listens.
[306:38.97]I think he does.
[306:45.54]Okay.
[306:45.72]I was just thinking it would be one of those things where he eats me for a cutscene.
[306:54.00]Like, come on.
[306:55.69]The last two times that has happened, he's eaten me and we've seen a cutscene.
[306:58.51]I just wanted to see if it was going to happen.
[307:00.87]I was going to zap it.
[307:07.10]Oh my god.
[307:17.37]Can I play the game?
[307:18.55]Am I allowed to play the video game on Twitch?
[307:35.59]What would happen if I zapped the first one?
[307:37.19]I don't think I had the shield for the first one.
[307:48.98]What are you taking us up there?
[307:52.50]Back up that way?
[308:02.03]Looks like he wants to jump up there.
[308:17.31]Give me a fucking break.
[308:18.98]Why, game?
[308:20.22]Why?
[308:20.70]Why?
[308:21.82]Why?
[308:26.42]I don't even know how that was even possible.
[308:31.67]And now he's gonna go back inside, isn't he?
[308:33.07]Hmm...
[308:46.84]Hey, the thing you just did again, do it again.
[308:48.60]I'm gonna pet his neck when I get up there.
[309:05.52]Or when we get a second, because I want him to actually jump up here.
[309:12.68]What?
[309:13.26]What the fuck?
[309:15.15]Why?
[309:19.40]I just put my fucking hand in my face for a second.
[309:24.07]I don't understand why he did it that time.
[309:26.41]Why did you not do it the time before that?
[309:30.67]Like, I don't get it.
[309:35.60]Like, I thought I had to jump up here because he wouldn't, he, like, put his paws up here.
[309:41.28]No, he was supposed to jump the whole way.
[309:42.88]Okay.
[309:43.70]Okay.
[309:51.44]We made it to the center of the universe.
[309:54.19]That's good, right?
[310:00.37]Okay.
[310:08.76]Oh, it looks like I'm getting off him.
[310:16.44]Let me clean you up a little first.
[310:21.99]One more.
[310:32.05]His ear too, hold on.
[310:36.57]Looks like he wants to jump to that.
[310:45.52]I don't think I'm going to let him though.
[310:47.62]I think I'm just going to climb down.
[310:52.68]Excuse me, dog.
[310:53.40]I want to kind of get off of you, but I'm scared that I'm going to fall if I get off of you.
[310:59.82]Or... Maybe he's just going to go over there.
[311:09.02]I think he is.
[311:10.60]Are you going to go over there?
[311:11.70]Really?
[311:19.56]I guess we're not even going down there.
[311:23.25]Apparently.
[311:23.79]A lot of these things to take rid of.
[311:27.39]Take rid of here.
[311:35.12]I don't think he's going to do this.
[311:38.42]Maybe he will.
[311:42.08]Let's see if there's anything I can jump to here.
[311:46.48]There's that one down there.
[311:55.77]Okay, I'm gonna zap this shit, but I'm terrified I'm gonna fucking fall off of him, so... I love how the zap has changed.
[312:21.84]It's not the electricity, the big lightning arcing bolt.
[312:24.00]It's like these little beams now.
[312:35.37]Do I forget to zap every time?
[312:36.65]No, I just want to see if there's another way to do it.
[312:46.26]Alright, well, I can destroy this floor now.
[312:51.97]Alright, come in here.
[312:52.53]Through here, dog.
[313:08.48]We know you forgot.
[313:09.52]I didn't.
[313:10.08]I swear.
[313:11.06]I just want to see if there's like other things to do.
[313:21.67]There's no other way.
[313:22.77]Only one solution.
[313:29.69]Can you get the other one up?
[313:31.05]Get the one hanging up there too.
[313:33.42]See if I can sneaky.
[313:34.38]Do it very sneaky.
[313:35.78]You can do it.
[313:36.92]Through the arc.
[313:39.98]Through the arc.
[313:43.01]Oh, what a shot.
[313:44.59]What a shot, dog.
[313:47.23]You get an award.
[314:00.88]Alright.
[314:02.64]Oh, he's going up, I think.
[314:03.88]Wait for me.
[314:05.56]Wait for me.
[314:06.06]If you're going to do that shit.
[314:16.43]Looks like he really wants to jump over there.
[314:17.97]I think he's going to go there.
[314:23.43]Any more of those?
[314:24.07]I don't think so.
[314:24.73]Another jump.
[314:34.84]Alright, we've made it to the top of this thing.
[314:38.36]Where have we?
[314:46.38]Where have we?
[314:52.08]This actually has a pretty long way to go.
[314:53.73]This is actually a shitload.
[314:55.61]Okay.
[314:57.63]Well.
[315:01.07]We get over this door.
[315:06.93]Jump over this way.
[315:07.95]Here it comes.
[315:09.63]Here comes the fall.
[315:10.31]I'm going to fall.
[315:12.13]Oh, boy.
[315:30.14]Easy enough.
[315:31.88]God damn it.
[315:39.06]I say easy enough.
[315:40.00]God, fuck.
[315:46.47]Oh, come on.
[315:48.19]Come on, really?
[315:49.01]You're gonna put me all the way fucking back here?
[315:50.63]Because of the stupid finicky-ass jumps in this game?
[316:01.07]Please, game.
[316:02.03]What the hell?
[316:18.94]Easy game.
[316:24.63]Just give me a fucking break.
[316:29.23]No, there's still another one.
[316:33.02]You didn't shoot this one?
[316:47.48]You want to try shooting the structures holding the eyes?
[316:49.54]Let's see what happens.
[316:53.27]Oh, guys, it went through.
[316:53.91]It went through the hole.
[316:57.83]Somebody wanted to test it.
[316:58.55]Let's see what happens.
[317:00.21]Uh, no.
[317:03.31]They still stay.
[317:14.98]They do shatter really nicely.
[317:20.72]Alright, let's do it.
[317:21.60]Let's do the big climb.
[317:22.68]Oh, no, no, wait.
[317:25.10]It's out here.
[317:26.60]Oh, good jump.
[317:35.99]Yeah, good boy.
[317:36.67]I just ran through.
[317:37.73]I'm just being impatient now because... If I'm going to be completely honest, I'm kind of... kind of done with the whole jump and grab ledge part of this game.
[318:01.01]I cannot fall this time.
[318:02.25]I have to do these perfect.
[318:05.69]Come on.
[318:08.67]This is the last time the kid... Yeah, the dog has been eating a lot.
[318:20.08]The kid, not so much.
[318:29.14]Ah, boy.
[318:29.92]Okay.
[318:31.06]I wish there was a goddamn quicksave.
[318:41.94]Alright, wipe off my hands.
[318:44.82]Here we go.
[318:47.55]And the camera, can you... Stop doing camera...
[318:57.48]You're fucking making this even more difficult.
[319:03.46]I swear to God.
[319:04.92]Why does it... If I move the camera, I'd like it to stay where I put it.
[319:08.05]I'm just saying.
[319:11.87]That was so much harder to do because I couldn't see what I was doing.
[319:17.54]I almost just missed that one too.
[319:33.01]Can you get over here?
[319:35.11]I wonder... Oh, here we go.
[319:47.86]What the fuck?
[319:49.34]What?
[319:50.14]Why?
[319:52.82]Why?
[319:53.20]Like... Was it just not... I did it the exact same way I did it the last time.
[320:05.03]There was... I... Oh my god, I'm fucking actually getting mad at this game.
[320:16.29]I did... Every other time I've jumped off a ledge to grab one of those, I've done it in the same fucking spot.
[320:31.42]Yikes.
[320:39.36]Do it again.
[320:45.65]Press R1 and triangle.
[320:48.49]Is he gonna hit it?
[320:50.25]He's not gonna hit it, is he?
[320:55.49]It's like swinging around and shit.
[320:57.21]What the fuck?
[320:59.19]This is actually infuriating.
[321:06.73]Oh my god, no!
[321:08.27]Why did it change on me?
[321:10.77]This fucking game.
[321:14.93]What?
[321:15.19]This camera is fucking moving around so I can't even do this shit right now.
[321:21.70]Seriously.
[321:24.18]Where are you going?
[321:36.89]Did you see that thing?
[321:38.37]Shoot that thing!
[321:44.29]I'm not pressing any buttons, it just decides to put- Oh no, dog.
[321:47.92]You just went up there without me.
[321:57.49]Now you gotta come get me.
[322:06.70]Jerma is actually mad.
[322:07.94]I kind of am at this point.
[322:18.67]Let's go have a tea break.
[322:33.53]No, I just think the one jump that I can't do puts me so far back.
[322:40.43]Because it needs to be physics perfect.
[322:43.27]Fuck you, I can fly this whole time.
[323:06.04]Alright, here we go again.
[323:06.74]Wait, what do you think?
[323:08.56]Am I gonna miss the, uh, am I gonna miss the fucking jump again?
[323:10.78]I almost just walked off.
[323:33.97]Where's it fucking going?
[323:36.04]We're just going!
[323:37.76]I'm not wasting any more time.
[323:40.32]Just go.
[323:41.38]Go!
[323:46.96]Go again!
[323:48.52]I'm done.
[323:48.78]I'm not doing that shit again.
[324:03.23]That was all in.
[324:03.85]I put all the chips on the board.
[324:04.81]That was all in.
[324:09.51]If I fucked that one up, I don't know what I was gonna do.
[324:11.19]Please have that be a checkpoint.
[324:20.30]Ronnie.
[324:22.88]Ronnie.
[324:23.80]Whomp Ronnie with a hundred dollars.
[324:27.51]Oh my god, Ronnie.
[324:30.81]That's a lot of money, dude.
[324:33.61]Thanks for the money.
[324:34.47]Thanks for the money, Ronnie!
[324:37.87]Uh, if you don't know Ronnie, guys, Ronnie has been pretty much king mod.
[324:41.43]He was one of the first real mods of the channel.
[324:44.35]And he's a really great guy.
[324:46.07]He's a really good dude.
[324:47.85]And he just gave me $100.
[324:48.43]So thanks a lot, dude.
[324:54.56]Alright.
[324:55.70]Let's keep going.
[324:56.34]Let's shadow some glass.
[324:58.66]Before I eat my own hand.
[325:02.49]Yeah.
[325:12.70]Is that it?
[325:13.12]Is there another one?
[325:15.94]I don't know.
[325:17.42]I don't know.
[325:17.70]I don't want to scale the fucking mountain anymore.
[325:20.50]I don't want to scale the fucking mountain tops anymore.
[325:23.17]Are we going to make it to 500 squares?
[325:31.33]We might.
[325:34.67]Take us across.
[325:37.17]Good dog of mine.
[325:40.04]Go on.
[325:50.81]Totally not paid for with those bits.
[325:53.31]Conspiracy.
[325:56.37]Dog, what are you doing?
[326:00.76]You gotta get a running start like I did.
[326:02.08]You have to do what I did.
[326:02.90]See, even Trico failed on the jump.
[326:05.30]He knew he'd have to just run and do it.
[326:09.31]There he goes.
[326:10.33]Come on.
[326:14.33]Alright, is he gonna do it?
[326:18.45]He's like just amping himself up.
[326:19.67]Come on, man!
[326:23.72]There he goes!
[326:24.38]Oh shit, not again.
[326:29.42]Not again.
[326:30.70]Is he in?
[326:46.10]What's wrong with him?
[326:47.82]You're okay.
[326:58.09]We have to be getting close.
[327:01.15]There's not much more.
[327:02.51]There can't be much more to do.
[327:06.65]This is the big final tower in the game.
[327:16.30]Yeah, that was a victory screech.
[327:22.34]Take us up.
[327:28.61]Trico is mad.
[327:29.41]Yeah, there's something for you to jump to over there.
[327:38.46]Can you do that, or do I have to do it?
[327:40.34]Do I have to scale around again?
[327:44.02]It looks like I can.
[327:48.56]I think I might have to jump from his head onto that.
[327:53.63]Probably not.
[327:54.43]He just might be being... He might be just being stupid right now.
[327:57.27]Come on.
[328:04.09]Who is guarding who?
[328:04.89]I don't know.
[328:05.25]That's the question.
[328:07.49]There we go, right?
[328:08.55]You can make that.
[328:09.09]Just sneak your little body out here and just jump up.
[328:19.59]I mean, is there enough room for you?
[328:21.27]There's enough room for you to kind of stand over here, isn't there?
[328:25.15]I really don't want to have to jump from there to there.
[328:26.73]There you go.
[328:31.94]Come on.
[328:32.24]There you go.
[328:32.58]Get out.
[328:33.46]Yeah.
[328:34.08]Do it.
[328:38.62]Stupid dog.
[328:39.42]You make me look bad.
[328:40.44]Are we almost at the top of the mountain?
[328:52.41]We are.
[328:52.81]One more?
[328:58.31]Alright.
[329:02.44]Oh no, what now?
[329:05.70]Oh fuck, zap!
[329:07.74]Zap!
[329:12.31]Shoot it!
[329:13.97]I don't know where the camera is right now, but I hope I'm shooting it at it.
[329:18.23]There you go, good.
[329:22.54]Oh boy.
[329:23.08]No, there's still another guy.
[329:29.05]Damn it.
[329:29.97]Stop it.
[329:31.19]Stop.
[329:31.93]Look at how slow this is moving.
[329:34.31]Shoot him.
[329:35.19]Shoot that guy.
[329:37.83]Shoot him.
[329:39.86]That almost just hit me in the fucking face.
[329:44.88]Alright.
[329:45.26]Any more?
[330:04.72]As hard as I possibly can as an adult male to walk it this way I was about to fucking scream
[330:16.28]You would've just heard a 31-year-old male screaming.
[330:20.46]Like a girl.
[330:21.66]Like a screech.
[330:22.86]Like... I was about to just lose my shit.
[330:41.11]I was gonna lose my goddamn mind.
[330:45.72]That was like a controller through the monitor turn off console turn off stream.
[330:52.72]That was really close.
[330:58.20]Oh my head is killing me.
[330:59.99]God damn it man.
[331:01.27]Come on.
[331:02.41]Don't do that to me now.
[331:05.31]We still have a little bit more to climb.
[331:07.99]Right?
[331:09.81]Right?
[331:11.19]Are we jumping across?
[331:11.97]I think we're jumping across.
[331:17.19]If I were to take a guess, I'd say we're jumping across.
[331:19.53]If I'm running jump, he's gonna fall off again, probably.
[331:38.90]Here comes the sprint!
[331:51.32]No, what did you do?
[331:52.62]You just... He just like did the bird into the office building.
[332:02.72]He just did the bird in... Hope he's okay.
[332:11.39]Oh, my fucking head.
[332:12.55]He's killing me.
[332:17.67]Pull him.
[332:18.43]Pull Trico.
[332:23.91]Can we be done with scaling the walls?
[332:28.41]Nero, it's okay.
[332:32.51]That was a good jump.
[332:33.19]You tried.
[332:41.25]You're okay.
[332:42.28]Good dog.
[332:50.48]Well, there's no going down from here.
[332:52.38]So... We're gonna get to the top, and the game's gonna end.
[332:56.04]Because I can't foresee a reason why we would be coming back down.
[333:01.81]I swear, if we get knocked off this and go back to the starting area of the game... I'm not sure I'll be that happy about it.
[333:24.69]You know where to go.
[333:25.41]You've done this... Trico, you've done this, like, a dozen times now on the same building.
[333:33.83]You know what you need to do.
[333:35.89]Come on.
[333:36.65]Just do it.
[333:38.25]Do it for Daddy.
[333:39.21]Come on.
[333:42.21]See?
[333:43.23]You're doing great.
[333:50.50]Come on.
[333:50.92]Do it for Daddy.
[333:57.36]Let's do it.
[334:00.43]This wouldn't take nearly as long.
[334:03.59]If... What are you doing?
[334:12.37]What are you doing?
[334:12.87]No, no, sit, sit!
[334:13.97]Sit, boy!
[334:14.63]Sit!
[334:15.78]Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
[334:17.66]We're not going that way.
[334:18.98]Sit!
[334:20.06]Sit!
[334:31.03]Trico, you didn't do it right.
[334:33.21]You didn't do it right.
[334:34.13]We need to go that way.
[334:39.56]I appreciate your effort, Trico.
[334:41.10]I do.
[334:48.32]Just resting here with my hand on my chin.
[334:52.49]He's not gonna jump out this way, is he?
[334:54.91]No.
[334:56.07]I gotta get down.
[334:56.63]I gotta get off him.
[334:57.71]Like, get over here.
[335:01.53]He's going, he's going, he's going, he's going, he's going.
[335:17.86]He was facing backwards.
[335:19.28]You can point where you want him to go.
[335:21.62]See, well, if I hold down R1, right, and I move my hand, I can point backwards, and he'll let go that way.
[335:26.32]So it doesn't matter which way I'm facing, as long as I tell him which way to go, he should do it.
[335:33.99]So, for instance, I'm saying go in there.
[335:35.91]I'm, like, turning my back sideways.
[335:38.19]So he's going to go this way.
[335:46.11]Let's see.
[335:55.87]Alright, dog.
[335:56.41]I don't want to have to give you a D-.
[335:58.07]Do it.
[336:06.79]Okay, good.
[336:08.45]Good.
[336:10.35]Gotta do that again.
[336:12.13]Up there.
[336:14.35]Oh, shit.
[336:15.29]Really?
[336:18.63]No, no, no, no.
[336:23.46]Stop.
[336:25.60]Take out the shield, please.
[336:27.32]Is this gonna be too close of a zap?
[336:30.52]Ah, easy.
[336:33.63]This might be too close.
[336:34.41]I don't know.
[336:36.11]Hopefully he shoots it.
[336:38.58]I hope he doesn't blow me off.
[336:46.10]Alright, you're good.
[336:48.82]Keep going.
[336:49.26]Wow, we're still climbing this thing.
[337:05.61]Are we going again?
[337:06.73]Are we going again, dog?
[337:08.89]I don't know if you can make that.
[337:13.53]Well, you can fly.
[337:15.74]If you fly, we can do it.
[337:16.76]Is there something else you need to jump up to?
[337:23.82]I need to go in there and press a button.
[337:30.65]Let me go in there and see if I press a button.
[337:32.25]Hang on right here.
[337:38.91]This game loves to do this lovely thing where even if you're pressing a direction, you just kind of stay on him.
[337:45.93]Just sit around him.
[337:47.31]It's a very, very lovely part of the game.
[337:51.35]100%.
[337:51.37]10 out of 10.
[337:53.79]Loveliest part of the game.
[338:00.52]Great.
[338:02.20]Great.
[338:10.60]Lovely.
[338:11.12]Look at this lovely part of the game here.
[338:16.03]Can I not... Why can I not get up there and squeeze over?
[338:18.97]Oh, hi.
[338:19.31]Am I... Okay.
[338:22.85]Fall off.
[338:43.43]You gotta do this to me.
[338:45.19]These little tiny jumps with how weird and awkward it is to move around.
[338:50.73]Those are like the hardest ones besides the ones where you have to run and jump.
[338:55.65]Well, here's the final switch of the game, probably.
[339:00.21]Who knows?
[339:00.53]Let's see what it does.
[339:02.09]See that?
[339:25.51]Alright screamer skip no don't even fucking make don't make that joke go nah this is gonna be a pain in the ass to get down to Is this even a good idea
[339:48.17]I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.
[339:50.24]I was gonna jump over there, but... Okay, he's right here.
[340:01.62]Alright, let's go.
[340:02.62]Go on.
[340:09.21]That way.
[340:11.03]There you go.
[340:25.16]There's still more of a tower to climb.
[340:40.13]Alright, we can't be that much further.
[340:50.86]Unless there's something else I have to do here, which I don't think I do.
[341:01.41]Is that the end goal?
[341:04.25]That pawn from chess?
[341:06.55]Told you guys.
[341:07.11]I needed to play chess the whole time.
[341:10.28]There it is.
[341:10.68]There's the bishop.
[341:21.90]Is there more of those dumb things I used to jump on?
[341:26.36]Can you fly, Trico?
[341:27.78]Okay, he's gonna turn, he's gonna fly.
[341:29.78]Alright, here we go.
[341:39.67]Fly to the top of the rook, the bishop, the queen, the king.
[341:57.79]Yeah.
[342:01.84]Yeah.
[342:03.66]Hello.
[342:04.46]Uh, hello.
[342:07.44]Yeah?
[342:11.48]There it goes.
[342:15.66]Here it goes.
[342:20.10]Come on, fly there.
[342:21.11]Spread your wings.
[342:23.15]Get over there.
[342:28.31]Trico, can you fly there?
[342:29.37]No, I guess I have to climb more of a building.
[342:36.02]What?
[342:50.17]This is too dangerous for me.
[342:53.71]Isn't this too dangerous for me?
[342:57.59]Looks like I can get up here, though.
[343:00.75]It's too dangerous, but I freaked out.
[343:02.53]I needed his help, but it doesn't even matter.
[343:03.73]I'm here.
[343:13.08]It never ends.
[343:15.60]It never ends.
[343:16.32]It never ends.
[343:19.64]I don't want to climb this tower anymore.
[343:36.39]I need some more to climb.
[343:45.58]There it is.
[343:54.66]Another tower.
[343:56.16]Just going back and forth through the towers.
[344:05.38]Until eventually we get enough height where we can glide.
[344:18.91]Screamer skip.
[344:30.70]Screamer skip!
[344:34.42]Let's go!
[344:43.48]Okay, we'll just go across.
[344:45.94]Again.
[344:49.82]It's like, I feel like we're two steps forward, one step back.
[344:52.19]I feel like we're not even making any progress.
[344:55.89]I guess we are.
[344:56.57]Alright, let's go.
[345:20.27]Come on.
[345:34.54]God damn it.
[345:40.85]We just did this exact same thing again.
[345:43.65]You guys remember when we did this?
[345:49.63]I'm having flashbacks.
[345:58.61]Didn't it, like, we already do this?
[346:03.29]Hold on.
[346:03.63]Wait, what is going on?
[346:05.13]Did we, like... Why is... It's all blending together.
[346:12.96]I've done the same thing so many times.
[346:14.26]It's all together, blending.
[346:21.33]Th-th-this is right, isn't it?
[346:22.35]I wish I had binoculars.
[346:25.69]Do I go up that- what?
[346:38.12]Almost fell off again.
[346:41.94]Well, I saw like the bri- like the bridge came down, like I've just been so catatonic doing the same thing for the last like 45 minutes.
[346:48.48]That it's just like, okay.
[346:51.42]I guess we can just run now.
[346:58.15]Alright, go for it.
[347:01.13]Fly.
[347:12.47]The music's playing.
[347:14.15]Can you do it from here, buddy?
[347:15.31]Come on.
[347:24.07]Come on, the music is cueing you to do it.
[347:26.73]Alright, go.
[347:37.64]Take off.
[347:42.97]Where is the camera going though?
[347:54.78]Alright, let's get out!
[347:55.74]Fly!
[347:59.94]Take us out of this place, forever!
[348:01.32]Holy shit, these guys are... A lot of guys, actually.
[348:10.33]Whoa!

[349:33.82]Take it out!
[349:34.72]Only one guy left and he's running away.
[349:41.66]Kill him before he can break an Estus.
[349:56.92]Stop him.
[349:58.54]He has nowhere to go.
[349:59.18]Alright, I'm gonna get the kill.
[350:03.66]Give me the kill.
[350:08.00]Come here, you rat fuck.

[350:29.68]No, no, no, no, no, I don't need to get the spears.
[350:44.31]Not yet.
[350:44.95]Oh boy, this framerate is killing me.
[350:55.39]God, this is four frames a second.
[350:57.05]Please kill them so we don't have to do this anymore.
[351:02.55]Oh, he shattered it.
[351:04.03]Good.
[351:11.62]How many fucking more of these guys are there?
[351:16.91]Good, good, good, good.
[351:18.55]Give her the shield.
[351:33.46]Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm like getting fucked up.

[352:05.70]Can I grab his helmet?
[352:06.52]No.
[352:09.13]Any more shield, guys?

[353:02.25]Are they like another hundred enemies or what?
[353:03.63]One more guy?
[353:11.59]Is that it?
[353:17.78]No, no, no, don't move yet.
[353:39.79]He's still fighting like imaginary people.
[353:48.96]I'm trying to get to the spear.
[353:50.00]There's like three.
[353:52.98]Well, we can get one.
[353:59.38]Or can we?
[354:03.86]Maybe we can't.
[354:11.86]Can I please?
[354:16.25]Stop moving around!
[354:17.07]Oh my god.
[354:24.38]Goddamn.
[354:26.66]Jesus Christ.
[354:29.24]That was Zap up there, apparently.
[354:38.72]and right there and over here come on
[354:59.47]Any more up above me throwing spears?
[355:05.62]No, wait.
[355:07.08]Let me take like the next 30 minutes throwing spears at you.
[355:16.15]Calm down.
[355:29.10]Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's alright.
[355:33.04]One less FPS for here.
[355:35.65]That made that a lot more difficult.
[355:38.15]Don't think about running around at less than, like, 20, 10 frames a second.
[355:43.19]It's just... It just kind of hurts my brain.
[355:47.32]Okay.
[355:57.01]Otto, you're gonna get... Otto, you're gonna get some wet food tonight.
[356:01.55]He saw, he saw.
[356:09.01]Yeah, it's okay.
[356:17.68]The porcupine just got you a couple times.
[356:24.30]He saw, he saw.
[356:28.66]Yeah, good job.
[356:30.70]Any more?
[356:31.56]You have any more spears in you, good dog?
[356:34.64]I think that's it.
[356:41.49]Let's take care of his back.
[356:54.60]Okay, I think he's good.
[356:56.18]No, up in the neck.
[356:57.64]Let's take care of your neck.
[357:00.48]Yeah, there's a lot of blood up there.
[357:03.95]Don't worry.
[357:05.15]Papa will just smear it around a couple times.
[357:07.97]Now he's hungry.
[357:13.58]Yeah, after a big fight like that, you deserve a bucket of grease, whatever the hell it is.
[357:19.22]Okay.
[357:26.55]Good job.
[357:28.21]Now let's go figure out what the hell is even here.
[357:29.79]There's a door.
[357:35.71]Anything else over here?
[357:38.81]Probably not, but let's just look.
[357:53.33]This has to be the last area.
[357:55.23]So, I'm sure we'll be done shortly.
[357:59.55]See, I told you it was chess.
[358:01.53]Oh, no, never mind.
[358:02.63]That's not chess.
[358:03.15]What the hell is this?
[358:08.04]Just put the mirror in?
[358:09.54]Okay.
[358:10.62]Ugh.
[358:22.46]Alright, I'm at God's house.
[358:24.01]Let's see what God says.
[358:25.27]Alright, you guys ready to meet God and find out what's happening?
[358:34.53]Let's do it.
[358:40.90]No, I don't like this.
[358:41.64]This place is like... This is blurry and icy and...
[358:55.24]Okay.
[358:56.90]Can he get in here?
[359:03.76]Come here, we got another spot to put this in.
[359:08.24]You and me, dog.
[359:20.82]Let's see what we do.
[359:22.26]What's gonna happen?
[359:28.07]It's just an elevator.
[359:31.69]Whoa, whoa!
[359:36.26]I just saw what Indiana Jones does.
[359:38.44]Was I supposed to do that?
[359:41.18]Hold on, wait.
[359:41.70]Can you, like, zap this?
[359:54.43]Was that gonna open?
[359:59.87]I wonder if this is a break or something.
[360:01.27]I don't know.
[360:01.67]Can he break it?
[360:03.15]That just scared the shit out of me.
[360:04.17]Let's see what I... No, fuck it, whatever.
[360:12.26]I can go down, but I don't think I want to.
[360:15.28]Let's just see what happens.
[360:17.72]Maybe he'll just crush through it or something.
[360:27.32]Maybe he'll...
[360:32.57]I'm holding circle.
[360:35.73]Just decided to take it out for some reason.
[360:38.71]Alright, can you just like stuff your head up there and like crush it?
[360:44.30]What's gonna happen?
[360:45.16]Yeah, no shit.
[360:45.78]No shit.
[360:46.06]I betcha I gotta go down here.
[361:01.57]More like platforming probably, gotta jump on like a crevice.
[361:13.31]Ooh!
[361:14.05]Stick your tail in there.
[361:14.70]Do what you were just doing.
[361:23.38]Can you drop your tail in one of these and I can slide down it?
[361:29.31]Can't even tell if that's what I'm supposed to be doing.
[361:37.16]Put your tail down the hole.
[361:43.76]Can you sit right here?
[361:50.32]Wait, hold on.
[361:52.54]Let's see if I can do something up here.
[362:00.80]No.
[362:02.24]I'm going to do something in that room.
[362:05.93]That just opens this door.
[362:07.03]Alright, I'm gonna have to move his tail around.
[362:12.88]Come here, you!
[362:13.46]Can you slide your tail into one of these things?
[362:27.19]Come on!
[362:31.17]Jump down as a social experiment.
[362:35.73]Alright, now sit right here.
[362:36.75]And then let me see your tail.
[362:43.73]Go ahead, sit.
[362:51.47]Sit.
[362:57.39]Right there.
[362:59.05]There you go.
[362:59.97]Okay.
[363:00.61]Give me your tail.
[363:16.77]Drop it down there.
[363:19.51]The whole thing.
[363:21.96]Okay.
[363:26.52]Let's take a peek.
[363:28.54]The camera doesn't want me to do this.
[363:43.77]I don't think I need to do this.
[363:49.23]There we go.
[363:55.03]There's a ledge right here.
[363:56.49]There's all kinds of weird shit in here too.
[364:06.21]What the hell is this?
[364:07.31]I don't think my brain is ready for one of these.
[364:26.26]Well, okay, I gotta take the ha- ha- ha- haaaaaa. Ah, come on. Come on I-
[364:43.26]Is there a way- I gotta zap him with the tail, right? Can I even do that?
[364:48.26]Can I bring him out here and have him be shocked by the tail?
[364:54.40]Where is he?
[364:55.86]Can you shoot him?
[364:57.88]Do you know where this is pointing?
[365:01.95]Thank God.
[365:12.28]Well, let's start putting heads on.
[365:14.80]Or should I... I'm not sure what I do first.
[365:25.72]What symbol was this?
[365:26.48]This is like a... I can't even fucking tell.
[365:29.02]Who cares?
[365:31.13]It'll happen eventually.
[365:36.49]Come and get me.
[365:39.99]Come and get me.
[365:53.09]Shoot him.
[365:57.49]I hope that's what I need to be doing.
[366:05.88]There's these spots for this to go, too.
[366:07.30]Let's try putting it in one.
[366:08.78]Let's see what it does.
[366:18.78]It's taking off one of these, right?
[366:23.31]I have to activate all of them.
[366:27.37]Well, we're going to be here for a while.
[366:28.45]It's going to be another one of them, and eventually it's...
[366:48.27]Okay, looks like that one's activated, too.
[366:50.02]Any more helmets, too?
[366:51.48]I don't know.
[366:55.26]24-hour stream incoming?
[366:57.22]Probably.
[367:00.35]I wonder if there's, like, a rhyme or reason to this.
[367:01.79]Probably not.
[367:05.87]Just gonna have to activate them all, I guess?
[367:10.73]Do the zap to everybody?
[367:11.78]I'm gonna accidentally fall in the goddamn hole, I know it.
[367:26.90]shoot him quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick did you get him you didn't shoot him what please shoot him please please please please
[367:57.71]Well, I just want to run around again.
[368:12.35]Let's do this like seven ways.
[368:30.13]I'm bringing a helmet to this one.
[368:33.02]Helmet was the answer all along, that's true.
[368:41.14]Now really is no jokes and no swears.
[368:42.94]Yeah, I'm just trying to get through this.
[368:45.33]This has to be one of the last areas in the whole game.
[368:47.67]That guy already has a helmet on.
[368:50.19]Can I swap his helmet?
[368:55.09]No, you don't even need a helmet.
[368:56.71]You don't even need a helmet!
[369:01.92]He just comes alive!
[369:02.74]Nice job.
[369:24.22]Last one is this guy.
[369:25.66]And then hopefully we can get the hell out of this.
[369:29.58]Out of this weird underground lair.
[369:38.10]I believe this is your head.
[369:41.28]Alright, let's go.
[369:42.26]No, there's more.
[369:44.38]There's another one after this.
[369:54.96]Get stuck on walls, please.
[370:03.84]I'm glad you guys stand still.
[370:16.48]Okay... Is there just one more here?
[370:25.91]I think that's... Let me just make sure that's the last one.
[370:27.69]So we can get the hell out of here.
[370:32.35]That is the last one.
[370:33.49]Alright, what does he look like?
[370:35.29]What kind of helmet does he need?
[370:38.35]One of these ones.
[370:38.83]Uh, let's just try this one.
[370:54.73]Jupiter chat.
[370:57.99]Zip zap!
[371:10.03]Zap him.
[371:15.33]That's it.
[371:19.95]Activate the final crystal.
[371:22.09]And let's get out of here, dog.
[371:28.07]We made it.
[371:47.53]I gotta get the tail now.
[372:05.03]Okay.
[372:06.59]Are we ready to see the storyline of The Last Guardian?
[372:13.89]I wonder what it could be.
[372:14.85]You've been sitting this whole time.
[372:15.98]You've been such a good dog right now.
[372:19.27]Very good job.
[372:21.93]You stayed the whole time.
[372:27.75]Let's go!
[372:28.19]A plus for not dying while jumping.
[372:37.30]I was just trying to stay completely focused there.
[372:39.48]Because a bad fall or fucking that up would have been nightmarish.
[373:00.44]Alright, we made it to an even bluer room.
[373:04.60]Here we go.
[373:12.21]I'm gonna get grabbed on his back.
[373:17.61]I feel like I'm in the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory right now.
[373:29.78]zap the guys on top
[373:59.67]I won.
[374:10.08]Get off.
[374:10.66]He's like, .
[374:33.38]Timmy, come on, stop making this hard.
[374:35.96]Another one.
[374:38.18]Any more?
[374:40.04]Are we all done with these guys?
[374:42.25]I think that's it.
[374:48.91]There's another guy coming up.
[374:56.54]There's another guy coming up with some raptors.
[375:01.72]Is he wanting more of them?
[375:13.40]I wonder, is there something I'm missing here?
[375:28.82]Or are we being spawned?
[375:32.06]Do I have to go in one of these doors?
[375:43.90]I feel like I'm supposed to do like like turn off the spawning
[376:19.26]I can't even grab his head.
[376:20.62]It does this little shimmy, and I'm gonna get grabbed.
[376:34.07]More?
[376:34.71]Anybody up top?
[376:50.20]Is there like a shut off button that I'm not seeing?
[376:53.48]What if I like... I have no... I'm not sure.
[377:13.59]If I just fell in a hole, I would've just blew up.
[377:18.35]I'm gonna go throw like a fucking zap on the ceiling and see what happens.
[377:34.81]Once I get a second here, I don't think I'm gonna have enough time to do it.
[377:51.90]I feel like maybe I need to get up top.
[377:53.94]Give me a distraction.
[377:54.94]Come on, knock him down.
[377:55.70]Knock him down.
[377:56.26]Knock him down.
[377:57.42]Knock him down.
[377:58.78]Knock that guy down so I can do this!
[378:02.66]Knock him down!
[378:03.52]I could climb on top of him, but I'm not going to get it off.
[378:14.72]Do it!
[378:15.68]Do it!
[378:21.29]No!
[378:21.47]I don't even know where I am.
[378:32.13]Shoot the ceiling!
[378:40.91]Why did that just happen?
[378:42.55]Why did that just happen?
[378:43.37]Why did it pull me back down?
[378:47.07]Why did it pull me away?
[378:51.82]It wasn't even near me.
[378:52.60]I'm gonna get on top of this here, but it's not important.
[379:08.90]Yeah, good thing I wanted to pick his head up.
[379:10.88]Thanks a lot, game.
[379:12.50]Yeah, I wanted to pick his fucking head up off the ground.
[379:15.68]Unbelievable.
[379:33.25]Is that doing anything?
[379:40.24]Apparently it is.
[379:55.31]We're at a very, very clean, solid three frames a second.
[380:26.32]How many more spears do you have in you?
[380:31.92]I can see one down here.
[380:34.59]The game's gonna crash.
[380:35.33]Oh, I would throw up.
[380:36.91]Blood would come out of my esophagus.
[380:38.07]There's one more.
[380:45.23]Stay still, buddy.
[380:52.60]It's because all the enemies died and it has nothing to do with me shooting it?
[380:56.52]If that's the case, then, like, what the fuck?
[381:00.86]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[381:05.53]Alright.
[381:06.09]Are we gonna, like, jump up onto this thing and fuse together as one?
[381:10.15]Where are you gonna take us?
[381:18.97]Should I get in?
[381:19.91]Maybe I need to, like, get in.
[381:21.94]See what this thing even is.
[381:22.78]I mean, I can, like... Oh!
[381:32.20]Uh-oh.
[381:35.01]Okay.
[381:45.44]Okay.
[381:50.49]This really is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
[381:55.25]This really is.
[381:55.87]We're going in the glass elevator and we're gonna fly.
[382:13.00]Should we like zap the cage or something or are we just still here for forever?
[382:21.72]How can there be even less frames per second inside the elevator?
[382:35.39]Okay, we're... Where are we?
[382:57.52]There's a giant fan.
[383:05.51]Looks like you're looking at something.
[383:06.47]Wanna zap something?
[383:21.60]On what?
[383:22.82]The frames are back.
[383:24.56]We got our frames back.
[383:34.37]You're gonna jump to that?
[383:35.75]Can you even make that?
[383:39.53]Really?
[383:42.97]Maybe I should just zap this shit.
[383:47.79]Shoot one of these.
[384:14.44]Just shoot it, for my sake.
[384:18.54]Curious.
[384:19.42]Oh, I can climb up on that.
[384:20.72]That one's lower than the other ones.
[384:24.14]Go that way.
[384:24.62]Head that way.
[384:26.56]I can get on that one.
[384:28.87]Can't get on that one, but I can get on the other one.
[384:33.15]Yeah, we're at the Fizzy Lipton Bridge.
[384:34.09]We're at Willy Wonka again.
[384:37.55]Head over that way, dog, please.
[384:48.25]That looks like the lowest one, right?
[384:51.91]Oh, he can jump to it, I guess.
[385:04.58]Don't get too far up here.
[385:05.50]I probably could have zapped that thing.
[385:14.30]There was a tree.
[385:15.30]It's a little too late now.
[385:16.20]He kind of started just jumping.
[385:21.89]Let's destroy the core.
[385:22.85]Alright, can I get in there?
[385:27.29]That looks like a little vent I guess.
[385:32.45]Alright, destroy the core.
[385:52.76]Not sure that did anything.
[385:53.76]There's a vent there.
[385:59.35]Let's climb in there.
[386:13.48]Don't push me, don't push me, please don't push me off!
[386:15.82]Let's turn off the machine.
[386:36.21]There's the brain.
[386:45.33]I knew now that this was the master of the valley.
[386:48.77]Only by destroying this orb would I gain my frames per second back.
[386:53.17]It's only a matter of time.
[386:55.55]Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy.
[386:56.77]It's like trying to grab me with its goo.
[387:05.35]Do I have to just walk in this?
[387:34.84]This whole thing was just a YouTube prank.
[387:39.43]Oh, he doesn't like this.
[387:41.05]You don't like that.
[387:43.71]You don't like when I do this, do you?
[387:51.79]You hate that.
[387:52.54]Oh.
[388:12.87]Oh, do I climb into this thing?
[388:14.39]Oh, I don't think so!
[388:18.95]I kinda don't get it.
[388:30.10]Looks like I wanna ch- I could- Climb?
[388:35.42]I guess I could- I know I can climb it, but how does it- how do I keep turned off?
[388:42.36]Is there a thing I can set this in so it'll stay pointed the whole time?
[388:51.71]How do I... I can't move while holding this.
[388:54.69]Oh, let me do it.
[388:56.91]I can't walk while aiming.
[388:57.73]Doesn't seem to be the right way to walk.
[389:10.04]Unless...
[389:12.17]Was there another thing, another hole to go into?
[389:18.83]Is there another one up there or something?
[389:20.49]I'm just going to get in here, I guess.
[389:34.68]See if I can just make my way slowly into it.
[389:45.59]I'm kind of like right up the thing's ass right now.
[389:53.49]I see another hole over there, but I don't think I can get up to it.
[389:55.59]I don't think this is what I need to be doing.
[390:04.56]Ah!
[390:14.07]It hurts.
[390:18.09]I don't think I need to do this shit.
[390:23.27]What about like, what about this?
[390:25.07]It's like a ramp, but can I like, I guess I can walk up this?
[391:10.13]It's coming out of the cage still.
[391:20.73]See, now it's like off, but... Is there a spot where I can... Just hold it for a while?
[391:33.65]Well, I mean, I was sitting there for a long time holding this shit.
[391:40.35]Just climb the cage?
[391:41.15]If I put this down and I jump on that cage, I'm dead.
[391:52.19]Maybe I could put it underneath it?
[391:53.35]I guess.
[391:55.13]Try it.
[392:03.43]Well, I fell down as I got up.
[392:17.41]Okay, let's try to put it underneath.
[392:19.13]This is the ending.
[392:32.64]You already won.
[392:33.34]I've already done it.
[392:40.13]Don't shrink it completely?
[392:41.39]Well, I mean, okay, if I don't shrink it completely, it just expands again, see?
[392:47.32]Even when it's inside the cage.
[392:48.26]Ah, it's not coming out.
[393:06.72]Let me take another look around.
[393:13.33]Can't walk while aiming, I know.
[393:15.95]It expands slower in the cage?
[393:17.31]I don't think so.
[393:23.60]Don't... I mean, some people are saying don't do it all the way, but if I don't do it all the way, let's just get it inside the cage.
[393:31.98]Then... It slowly comes out?
[393:36.88]Again, I guess, yeah.
[393:37.78]Maybe I can climb it then.
[393:45.24]One, two, three.
[393:47.38]I feel like that wasn't it.
[393:48.41]Was that happening before?
[393:49.55]Let me see this.
[393:52.61]Okay, right.
[393:54.23]I think I put the shield back.
[393:58.93]Alright, so that's what you gotta do.
[394:00.01]Then I gotta climb it.
[394:02.35]You can walk while aiming if you have PS4 Prime.
[394:06.33]PS4 Prime.
[394:09.14]So get it right before it goes and then jump and climb it.
[394:11.92]That's apparently what I have to do.
[394:13.02]I have to get up there fast.
[394:31.28]Get up there.
[394:43.64]Can I not grab those?
[394:45.54]God.
[394:46.00]This ain't even a puzzle anymore.
[394:49.40]It's just annoying.
[394:51.00]Like, why did I not grab it right there?
[394:52.49]What was the point of not grabbing?
[394:54.73]Why did I not grab the cage right there?
[394:57.25]There was no reason not to.
[395:28.21]Get in the fucking goblet of fire.
[395:29.63]Where the hell even are we?
[395:51.28]We're above it right now?
[395:54.93]We're on the... fan?
[395:58.42]This... I'm gonna throw up looking at this.
[396:06.73]Can I keep climbing this?
[396:09.63]No idea.
[396:12.09]I see... I see something, though.
[396:15.43]I see a thing.
[396:16.57]Do I have to run with this?
[396:22.75]No way.
[396:26.59]Look, that's where the disc goes.
[396:27.85]Do I have to jump on this and run with it?
[396:32.53]I hope this is right.
[396:42.34]Oh, hold on to your lunch.
[396:44.67]Hold on to your lunch, guys, because I'm holding on to mine.
[396:56.09]I'm like squinting my eyes right now.
[397:02.59]Put it in.
[397:12.24]Success.
[397:16.52]Not success.
[397:18.50]Wait.
[397:23.01]Can you come up here, Trico?
[397:28.92]Can you get up here while I hold this?
[397:35.08]Where is he?
[397:44.97]Here he comes.
[397:48.72]Keep coming.
[397:53.05]Okay.
[397:59.74]Can... now what?
[398:01.44]Is he above it?
[398:04.60]Can I just climb out now?
[398:07.73]He's above anything.
[398:11.93]Let's make sure I'm doing this right.
[398:23.55]I guess I can't just jump up and climb, huh?
[398:31.46]Okay, I'm gonna try it.
[398:41.64]Maybe not.
[398:53.17]God!
[398:55.05]Put it in!
[398:55.59]Put it in!
[398:56.09]Put it in!
[398:56.55]Put it in!
[399:00.07]I guess I just gotta do it really fast?
[399:05.70]There we go.
[399:14.71]We should be up here, right?
[399:17.19]You up here, Trico?
[399:26.90]Drago?
[399:32.12]Drago?
[399:39.51]He's not still down there, is he?
[399:43.91]Oh, there he is.
[399:44.53]Hey, you made it.
[399:50.65]And roll credits.
[400:05.05]I think we're just gonna fly.
[400:23.75]Wait.
[400:26.69]I see something in the distance.
[400:28.38]Is that...
[400:33.78]No, I thought that was one of those things to put there.
[400:35.82]Let's just go.
[400:36.40]Fly, man.
[400:37.14]Take us out of here.
[400:37.78]I mean, there's that.
[400:43.12]Whatever the hell that is over there.
[400:51.85]Go that way.
[400:52.39]Let's just take a look.
[401:00.19]What is that?
[401:06.91]You don't look like you belong here.
[401:08.21]Whatever you are, it looks like there's debris on you and you can be destroyed.
[401:22.21]Shoot it!
[401:34.58]Getting me to broke some stuff.
[401:35.92]I don't know if it really mattered or not.
[401:37.26]Do we just fly into the sunset or what?
[401:39.84]Shoot again.
[401:53.17]Why do I get the weird feeling I have to clear this?
[402:09.29]Breaking it free?
[402:10.13]What if I just shoot the thing?
[402:11.95]Shoot the thing.
[402:19.14]Go on.
[402:32.89]No, we're clearing it, boys and girls.
[402:34.89]We're gonna clear the debris.
[402:36.68]We're gonna clear it.
[402:39.78]It wouldn't put this much crap in one spot if you didn't have to destroy it, right?
[402:47.13]Like, what's the purpose of this here?
[402:48.35]This is a huge pile of dog shit.
[403:03.76]Are we wasting time here?
[403:05.50]We might be wasting time.
[403:08.82]This might be a wasted... No, it's okay.
[403:15.88]I think we're just supposed to sit up here.
[403:46.15]Here come all the aliens, you're right.
[403:47.61]It really is aliens.
[404:06.88]It actually is aliens, right?
[404:35.60]Ugh.
[404:40.98]Okay, they collect the people and spit them into the mouth of the turkey?
[404:43.87]Did they get a treat basket?
[405:09.85]No, no, he became sentient.
[405:47.53]So wait, those barrels are people?
[405:51.57]That can't be what it is.
[406:01.74]No!
[406:04.86]Oh god.
[406:08.46]I don't know what to do here.
[406:10.95]Climbing the people basket?
[406:17.51]Something's glowing.
[406:18.03]Something's glowing.
[406:18.69]Glow, glow, glow, glow, glow.
[406:21.93]We're gonna do some zaps.
[406:29.07]Oh, please.
[406:29.93]No.
[406:32.36]There I go.
[406:42.48]Oh, God.
[406:45.98]We're gonna land right at the beginning of the game.
[407:02.75]Just die for me Pet him I'm gonna pet him
[407:34.84]Maybe I can rip his mask off.
[407:41.06]Let's go rip his mask off.
[407:42.10]I just can't see where the hell I am.
[407:50.64]Take the mask off.
[407:51.62]Can I rip it off?
[407:58.77]Looks like I can grab it.
[408:10.04]It's hard to even see.
[408:16.35]The mask came off the other one, but it came sentient, so... I've got to figure out a latch I can pull.
[408:20.91]Looks like I can... I'm looking at it right now.
[408:23.11]No, probably not.
[408:30.22]No, we just... We get that to fly her on.
[408:39.22]Let's get ripped up.
[408:51.63]Oh, God.
[408:52.55]No.
[408:53.71]Oh!
[408:54.85]Oh, my God.
[408:57.47]Oh, alright.
[408:58.73]This is where we get fucking real heavy.
[409:01.64]Holy shit.
[409:02.70]That's not... You can't even... I'm just gonna eat him.
[409:28.44]No, hold on, wait, what if I... Oh, hold on.
[409:36.30]The tail is in here, right?
[409:37.81]Can he shoot the- can he use his tail?
[409:42.31]I wonder if he can use his tail.
[409:43.33]Like, can I shoot with the tail?
[409:48.73]Like, the fucking center again or something.
[409:51.69]Turn off the router.
[410:00.48]Where did the tail go?
[410:05.92]Shit.
[410:06.44]I don't know.
[410:09.22]There it is.
[410:10.76]Um... Oh god.
[410:15.52]Is the hypothesis correct?
[410:16.54]Let me just see what happens.
[410:22.19]Is he gonna shoot?
[410:26.39]Ah!
[410:27.93]Got ya!
[410:30.61]The tail still lives!
[410:32.97]The tail lives!
[410:33.91]That didn't do it, though.
[410:42.14]That... I don't know what that did.
[410:48.48]I wonder if I can kinda fuck with the center somehow?
[410:54.41]I don't know.
[410:55.79]What if I go stand in it?
[411:00.25]I'm gonna go stand in it.
[411:02.09]I probably have to become the tower.
[411:03.80]I don't think I can drag it with me.
[411:15.54]Maybe I should drag it down?
[411:18.72]Bring it down, like, with me down there?
[411:20.12]Can I even do that shit?
[411:23.60]Where did it go?
[411:28.92]Where is the tail?
[411:29.66]Did it fall down there already?
[411:32.22]Maybe it, like, fell down there already.
[411:33.46]To, like, progress the game for me.
[411:34.94]Make sure I don't fuck that up.
[411:47.73]Yeah, tail's already down there.
[411:53.59]Let's just go.
[412:06.99]Alright, buddy.
[412:08.94]Now you're in big fucking trouble.
[412:13.90]You're in big trouble.
[412:16.46]Once my bones heal...
[412:22.26]Sayonara.
[412:24.92]Say goodbye to the brain.
[412:32.04]Boom.
[412:33.42]We need to do it one more time.
[412:37.15]And we gotta get it like in the... Oh god.
[412:42.39]We gotta do it like a couple times.
[412:49.07]Here we go again.
[412:49.87]Break another hole.
[412:56.37]Whoa, he's, that, that thing is mad.
[412:58.84]That thing's mad.
[413:11.31]Is that like my brain?
[413:33.50]The spell has been broken.
[413:37.36]They're dying.
[414:22.11]He's alive he's alive He didn't die after all
[414:50.29]We did it.
[414:51.45]Come on.
[414:51.87]We broke the spell and all the other weird dogs.
[414:55.31]Uh-oh.
[415:19.37]I hope we get out.
[415:21.09]If the tower collapses on the both of us, that's gonna be real sad.
[415:29.62]Get us out.
[415:30.75]Get us out, Trico.
[415:31.79]Come on.
[415:48.17]But when I turned that shit off, doesn't it kill him too?
[415:51.95]Because he's one of the dogs or something?
[416:00.70]He's going to fly.
[416:02.08]No, he's not.
[416:12.96]Come on.
[416:13.56]One last flight.
[416:14.46]What do you say, boy?
[416:17.78]One last flight!
[416:24.76]It's the other one that we freed.
[416:47.31]Oh no, we can't leave him!
[416:51.01]We have to go back!
[416:51.97]We can't leave that one!
[416:54.29]No!
[416:55.33]Oh boy!
[417:08.60]We can't leave Dark Trico!
[417:29.21]Oh, he's so sad.
[417:30.13]I shouldn't be laughing, but what if he just got hungry?
[417:58.43]We made it!
[417:59.11]But what about the other tricycle?
[418:06.76]I can't take it.
[418:08.60]I can't do it anymore.
[418:09.66]Is that it?
[418:16.47]No, he brings me back to my village.
[418:17.85]You were his first opponent.
[418:34.26]No, don't kill him.
[418:35.02]Don't kill him.
[418:35.62]No!
[418:38.76]No!
[419:04.98]Please give him some treats.
[419:06.38]He loves people treats.
[419:17.09]Come on, please.
[419:30.66]Cut to like him throwing a ball.
[419:37.16]What?
[419:37.46]Why?
[419:37.74]Are you serious?
[419:38.78]I'm not gonna kill them right now.
[419:43.18]That would be stupid.
[419:47.34]I just had to hit R1.
[420:04.87]Here they take... Here they take... Here they all... Here they come!
[420:18.45]I'm sorry.
[420:19.29]I'm sorry.
[420:20.41]I'm sorry.
[420:20.73]I'm sorry.
[420:48.27]He heard me.
[420:53.94]He's like, shit.
[420:55.32]I'll put all the spears in him.
[421:17.95]Who is he going to give his people treats?
[421:22.82]We are going to die.
[421:24.30]We are going to die.
[421:25.22]We are going to die.
[422:01.63]Where's Otto?
[422:06.65]That's it?
[422:15.53]Well, there's The Last Guardian.
[422:22.78]Alright, so let me deduce the story there.
[422:27.18]It looked like there was a bunch of sick kids or something.
[422:30.68]People like the villagers, everyone's sick somehow.
[422:34.48]I was lying on the ground, like, dying.
[422:38.00]Or maybe not.
[422:38.67]Maybe we were just sleeping.
[422:40.97]These things were trained to come get people to feed into, like, the alien machine.
[422:48.53]This one got his face mask taken off.
[422:56.55]Decided to help me because we became best friends.
[423:03.04]And through the process, we didn't really learn that much else.
[423:11.56]I'm not going to skip the credits.
[423:12.42]I'm going to stick around.
[423:16.63]I guess it's kind of up for... Unless there's another ending.
[423:20.91]Maybe it's up for interpretation of what actually was going on.
[423:35.04]I guess I just don't understand anything.
[423:42.88]So was he eating people?
[423:46.92]Is that like how they eat?
[423:48.62]But what was controlling them?
[423:50.36]That's what I don't get.
[423:55.36]Apparently there's more.
[423:56.28]There's another ending.
[423:59.28]I'm sure there has to be, but...
[424:01.90]I'm curious.
[424:02.42]I want to know if this is the green treat ship scrambled egg people.
[424:08.06]And was I feeding him people the whole game?
[424:09.58]Because that would be kind of interesting.
[424:13.26]And what's with the eyeballs?
[424:14.34]I don't know.
[424:14.88]What's the eye shit?
[424:15.70]It doesn't make any sense.
[424:17.08]I guess it's just up for interpretation.
[424:21.19]The tower was controlling them, but who were the guys in the suits?
[424:24.65]Who were those random sentient suit people?
[424:29.52]Does this tie into Shadow of the Colossus and Ico?
[424:31.50]I don't think so.
[424:34.02]Maybe it does.
[424:43.95]Well, if you want to know my true feelings, I'll give it to you for real.
[424:51.98]I'm not going to sugarcoat anything here.
[424:55.68]If this was like a four-part series on Netflix, I think it would have been better.
[425:04.72]I, like I said in the previous stream, I cared way more about like Trico and the main character here than about the video game.
[425:13.13]I don't think the video game was very good.
[425:18.81]Personally.
[425:21.97]I thought the areas were beautiful.
[425:23.64]The...
[425:25.96]The actual, like, dog was animated flawlessly.
[425:29.67]It was amazing.
[425:31.63]The atmosphere was fucking unbelievable.
[425:35.57]But I think just, like, the actual gameplay stuff... Sometimes it just didn't feel like it was working, and... It got frustrating killing the same enemy over and over again.
[425:46.79]That whole, like, run around at five frames a second while Trico hits, like, ten people...
[425:53.11]This shit is awesome.
[425:54.37]All the outdoor atmospheric, even though they're scripted events, they were still unbelievable.
[426:02.97]But when I think about it on the other side of the coin, I don't know how you make this game a better game.
[426:11.12]I don't know if it's possible.
[426:12.38]I don't know you can.
[426:14.62]They had a story they wanted to tell, and they told it very well.
[426:18.78]The dog was awesome.
[426:20.49]The kid was awesome.
[426:23.45]I don't even know if I'd want to give it, like, a letter grade.
[426:26.18]Because, like, in situations like this, like, I can imagine sitting here, like, this was awesome.
[426:31.70]These scenes were amazing.
[426:33.48]It was, you know, the bond between man and beast.
[426:38.99]I would have rather the gameplay itself.
[426:40.49]And when it did play itself is when I had the most fun.
[426:53.38]Would I recommend the game?
[426:56.54]I'm going to go with a probably.
[427:02.20]I think the game is more about the relationship and feeling something for Trico than... Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[427:05.84]And they nailed that.
[427:08.32]Feeling for Trico is like the whole game and feeling for like the connection between the two characters.
[427:19.27]And I think they did that very well.
[427:25.57]Remind me of the waterfall.
[427:26.83]Yeah, like, stuff like that just... Stuff that just didn't feel like it should have been that finicky was very finicky.
[427:34.24]Jumping and grabbing things.
[427:35.32]I mean, I'm gonna blame it on that.
[427:36.14]I'm gonna use that.
[427:36.62]I'm gonna blame that.
[427:41.88]But... I would put this on the probably recommended scale.
[427:47.66]Just because some of those events that happen outside are breathtaking.
[427:52.56]They're truly breathtaking.
[428:03.08]Skip?
[428:03.40]No, wait, what do you mean skip?
[428:09.58]What am I looking at here?
[428:18.17]Is this the flying saucer that crashed and caused all this in the first place?
[428:30.96]What is this?
[428:46.18]It's me, but all grown up
[429:02.27]Come on, he's going to come back.
[429:03.59]And he's going to be really old.
[429:21.54]He's going to be in heaven.
[429:44.99]Where is he?
[429:45.41]I want to see old Trico.
[429:52.09]No, he's just back here.
[429:54.67]Is he just back in like the volcano?
[430:04.12]Just hanging out?
[430:14.27]Oh no, he had a little fa- the other- the other Trico.
[430:18.03]He came back to the other Trico and he's gonna have the baby Tricos.
[430:25.54]Cause they don't know- they're not looking controlled by the device anymore.
[430:29.26]Yep, it's gonna be a litter of baby Trico pups.
[430:32.04]Here it comes.
[430:46.32]any second now come on yeah what's in the hole
[431:18.71]See?
[431:18.91]And there it is.
[431:32.46]It's nothing.
[431:34.96]Those two are just having a happy family now.
[431:41.79]Thank you for playing The Last Guardian.
[431:49.81]I know where to go now, so I'm going to beat it all again.
[431:52.79]Right now.
[431:56.16]Well, thank you guys for watching.
[431:57.68]That was equal parts infuriating in some places and equally breathtaking and amazing.
[432:04.68]I read one review before I played because I didn't want to spoil myself that much, but one of the reviews said that it has very, very high highs and very, very low lows.
[432:20.10]Which I would agree with.
[432:21.08]Because a couple of those times during... Especially this stream.
[432:26.85]And I'm not sure if it was a time constraint thing.
[432:28.87]Because I felt like I ran into all the annoying problems in this stream.
[432:41.09]But... Yeah.
[432:45.13]I would say if you have a PS4 Pro...
[432:48.80]PlayStation 4, it runs like shit.
[432:51.77]You all saw it.
[432:53.69]What I recommend is someone that watched me stream it.
[432:56.21]I mean, that's entirely up to you.
[432:57.77]That's on you, because this is a very, very much story puzzle game.
[433:03.38]And if you watched me do everything, and you don't think you could have the kind of same experience, hope you didn't get too frustrated.
[433:10.54]I didn't.
[433:11.08]There was only a couple times that I really was just kind of annoyed.
[433:14.79]One of them was how we didn't jump on the waterfall.
[433:19.05]And I tried it a bunch of times and it just was like that.
[433:23.14]It's too bad that that happened because that really soiled it for me.
[433:29.45]But I enjoyed it.
[433:30.51]I don't regret this purchase at all.
[433:32.13]I think it was a good investment because the story was great.
[433:35.58]I guess we can... There was no story to it, don't lie.
[433:38.18]Well, the story that I was telling myself the whole time I was playing.
[433:43.76]And that's like caring about the dog.
[433:48.33]But yeah, that's a question that you're going to have to answer for yourself because I can't say, oh yeah, go buy it right now.
[433:53.89]Because I would say if you were going to play it with somebody else maybe again...
[433:58.10]And you can see their reactions to the crazy breathtaking moments and... As a whole, though... I'm not sure.
[434:11.19]I would say it was very great in a lot of places, but... Like, scaling that tower to, like, ten times, doing the same thing, like, ten times in a row... Got pretty wearing on my brain.
[434:26.31]But we'll get a dog cam here.
[434:27.61]Never Trust Purple says, thanks for 10 bucks, dude.
[434:29.81]Beautiful game.
[434:30.29]They got the important parts spot on.
[434:31.87]I really felt like Trico was a real breathing, living creature.
[434:34.60]Gorgeously animated and rendered.
[434:35.90]I enjoyed it quite a bit.
[434:38.46]And that's the most important part of the game.
[434:42.38]It's hard to say, oh, the game sucked when the entire game was pretty much that dog bird.
[434:51.09]And how many times did you guys see me react to things going like, Whoa!
[434:56.28]Oh my god, that was fucking awesome!
[434:58.08]Like, oh, look at how cute he is!
[435:03.18]And if that's the whole point of the game, and that's what sells you, then yeah, for sure, then I would recommend it.
[435:08.57]But thanks everybody for watching.
[435:10.29]I'll see you tomorrow night.
[435:11.45]We're gonna start Let It Die.
[435:13.05]Hopefully I didn't get too salty tonight.
[435:16.79]I'm sure I did at some points, but I think justifiably so.
[435:21.16]How many squares did we end up with?
[435:22.84]450?
[435:24.28]That's not bad.
[435:26.15]But yep, thank you.
[435:27.71]I'm going to say thanks.
[435:28.41]We'll end with an auto-cam.
[435:32.83]But thank you, good boy, for the three months.
[435:34.73]CleverVirus, thanks for two months.
[435:36.82]Aloof11, thanks for three months.
[435:39.30]SaintSuzura, thank you for your sub.
[435:41.94]AllOfTheIs.
[435:43.76]PopTartBarbarianYJRD1.
[435:47.69]Soul Vision.
[435:49.91]Inu.
[435:50.11]I think I already got these guys already.
[435:52.81]Did I?
[435:54.38]Inu Akari.
[435:55.32]Thanks for two months.
[435:57.82]So Jin Yu.
[435:58.28]Thanks for nine months.
[435:59.18]I think I got these guys already, but just in case.
[436:02.46]Chai's Bakuli.
[436:03.24]I remember him.
[436:04.26]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[436:05.86]And Renegade Coaster.
[436:06.68]Five bucks.
[436:07.16]Thanks a lot, dude.
[436:07.68]It was enjoyable to watch.
[436:08.68]There were just some parts, especially the platforming and fights at the end that got pretty repetitive, but it was beautiful.
[436:14.99]yeah it once like the third or fourth wave of those enemies came out in the blue room there inside the dome that was trying my patience I can't pretend I'm not gonna lie
[436:28.62]And they all ended up dying right when I shot the ceiling and I thought that's what you had to do.
[436:32.84]Okay, that was like, remember in Ghostbusters 2 when Rick Moranis' character gets in the gear and he suits up and he shoots the, he gets out there with a big wall of slime where the Ghostbusters are inside and they're fighting and they're fighting.
[436:45.46]The Ghostbusters inside actually do the work and then Rick Moranis shoots the outside once and it goes away and he's like, I did it!
[436:55.53]That's what happened.
[436:57.96]But thanks a lot, Renegade, for the five bucks.
[437:02.17]Orthocone for 200 bits.
[437:03.29]They could have hired a better cameraman.
[437:05.29]Yeah, the camera was finicky too, but it wasn't terrible.
[437:09.13]Just got me aggravated in a couple places.
[437:11.67]Meester Hybee, thanks for the bits.
[437:12.95]Wet food, boys.
[437:13.88]That's right, Otto's gonna get some love tonight.
[437:16.96]And I mean that in the most... In a very, very, like, dog owner, father-son kind of way.
[437:24.64]I mean that as a... Hold on, let me redo that.
[437:30.94]Fuck.
[437:31.84]Auto is gonna be taken care of tonight.
[437:37.28]I have a headache, too.
[437:38.08]I'm sorry.
[437:40.72]But, yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
[437:41.72]Thanks, GrowDiv, for the five bucks.
[437:44.79]I beat the prologue.
[437:45.67]Oh, nice.
[437:52.43]Again, thanks, Ronnie.
[437:53.91]Womp Ronnie, if you're watching.
[437:55.31]You gave $100 earlier.
[437:56.43]That's a lot of money, dude.
[437:57.33]Thank you.
[437:59.57]If you don't follow Ronnie, you absolutely should.
[438:01.96]His comic is hilarious and he's a really good guy.
[438:05.16]Wompcomic.com I'm just laughing at what I just said.
[438:10.82]Alright, it's late.
[438:11.82]I'm going to bed.
[438:12.38]Here's the auto-cam.
[438:13.24]Here's my Last Guardian right here.
[438:18.20]You want to see my Last Guardian?
[438:20.14]And then I'm going to end the stream.
[438:21.84]Have a good night, guys.
[438:22.93]Take care.
[438:23.21]I'll see you tomorrow night, 7pm.
[438:25.21]And we're going to do Let It Die.
[438:27.53]Good night.
[438:43.90]It's not picking up my webcam for some reason.
[438:48.92]Is my webcam even plugged in right now?
[438:50.18]It should be.
[438:58.13]My webcam's not even plugged in.
[439:03.55]Hold on.
[439:03.93]I can't not show my last card.
[439:06.16]That would be bullshit.
[439:12.76]Hold on.
[439:15.05]What the fuck is that?
[439:16.83]What is going on here?
[439:22.23]Where's this thing even, what?
[439:26.86]It is plugged in.
[439:31.16]What are you on about?
[439:38.94]What are you on about?
[439:46.45]I just want to show my dog.
[439:47.65]I just want to show my dog to end the stream.
[439:52.09]What the heck?
[439:52.61]There we go.
[439:52.97]Alright.
[439:53.49]Here we go.
[439:56.37]Good night, guys.
[439:56.75]I'll see you tomorrow.
[440:12.08]There's my last guardian.
