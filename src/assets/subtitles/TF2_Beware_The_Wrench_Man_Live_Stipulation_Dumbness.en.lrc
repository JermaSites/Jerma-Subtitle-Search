[00:12.81]He's not dead.
[00:18.46]He's absolutely still alive, and he's probably gonna try to mage-tape me, so I better be careful.
[00:30.39]I'm laughing outside your spawn door!
[00:36.97]No, Jesus Christ!
[00:42.39]That's a spy.
[00:43.51]So is this.
[00:45.57]I know you're back here.
[00:46.33]I know you're right.
[00:47.13]You're not getting by me.
[00:49.12]I am certain you are standing right in this corner.
[00:51.16]Yep, I knew it!
[00:53.86]I can't believe he just died.
[00:55.54]I can't believe that.
[00:58.06]I cannot believe that.
[00:59.68]I can't believe we're being spawn camped either.
[01:01.84]I just can't believe this.
[01:04.90]I'll get behind him.
[01:07.28]What is going on over there?
[01:09.50]And as a Pyro, I'm so dead.
[01:12.30]Nope.
[01:13.06]Not quite.
[01:15.78]Nice.
[01:16.86]Nice job.
[01:18.56]God.
[01:19.46]In heaven.
[01:21.27]Hallowed be thy name.
[01:23.19]Thy... God, you just ruined my joke, man.
[01:28.28]Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven.
[01:34.09]Give us this day our daily pyro's bread, and drive us out for trespasses, for we have no trespassers among us, deliver us from evil.
[01:45.24]And beyond, and however else it goes, amen.
[01:50.24]I want to get at least two or three kills in a row.
[01:53.28]There's a heavy right there.
[01:54.28]He's our heavy.
[01:55.16]That's good.
[01:55.79]Mini sentry.
[01:57.23]I'm not going to get myself killed by that.
[01:58.77]We got a Schneider on the side there.
[02:01.67]I just got to... Here we go.
[02:04.83]Just chill out back here.
[02:06.54]Wait for some sorry son of a bitch to come out this door.
[02:10.50]No, they're all going straight.
[02:12.66]Somebody come out this door.
[02:15.46]Anyone.
[02:16.81]Anybody come out this side door.
[02:18.31]I'm literally standing right here.
[02:19.57]You're looking at me right now.
[02:23.97]Get behind the first point.
[02:26.03]And kill a bunch of people.
[02:28.03]Like this sniper.
[02:28.73]This sniper, I have to get this sniper.
[02:31.01]He's not paying attention.
[02:31.91]He's like shooting down this hallway.
[02:33.51]There's no A's dead because he got killed by this sniper that was down there.
[02:37.25]Okay, well plan ruined.
[02:38.89]Plan B. Go to their spawn and swing at some random person like this guy.
[02:43.66]Oh my god.
[02:46.94]And he was overheeled, too, so I don't even... He was six foot two, and what do you know?
[02:53.80]He was pooing his pants since he was two.
[02:56.06]He's a wrench man.
[02:58.28]He was 20 feet tall and had a ball.
[03:00.66]He swung his wrench down like them all, you know.
[03:03.10]He was a wrench man.
[03:05.48]Why is he always a certain height?
[03:07.54]In every country song, or every like ballad song, why are they always like a certain height?
[03:12.47]Oh, he was six feet tall.
[03:13.81]Who cares?
[03:14.87]Who cares if he was like two feet tall?
[03:16.37]Who cares?
[03:16.83]Who cares about this?
[03:18.53]Don't worry, I got this.
[03:20.33]Don't worry about a thing.
[03:22.06]I'm in pursuit.
[03:24.64]I'm in scout pursuit right now.
[03:26.40]He's not gonna get... Yes.
[03:28.10]You see?
[03:28.82]You see what happens when you mess with the ranch man?
[03:31.58]See, I was gonna do the same thing.
[03:32.64]You got a bloody lip.
[03:33.53]Hold on, please stand still so I can see that, like, butt lip you got.
[03:38.23]Come here, please.
[03:39.39]Come here, please!
[03:40.39]I just want to look at your, like, busted-ass lip for a second.
[03:46.83]Forget the head-on approach.
[03:49.11]I need to try to get behind literally everybody.
[03:51.26]I'm going around, not going that way.
[03:53.40]Screw that.
[03:54.06]We're going all the way back to their spawn.
[03:57.62]That's the only conceivable way I see that this is really possible, is to try to get behind everybody.
[04:01.89]Don't show yourself to anyone.
[04:03.65]Right here.
[04:05.01]This is the spot I'm talking about.
[04:07.59]Someone's gonna walk over here, and then... You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[04:14.67]What is this guy doing there?
[04:17.08]What is... What is that guy doing there?
[04:21.11]That guy being in like the weirdest wrong spot possible just got me killed because I'm in the weirdest wrong spot possible.
[04:29.79]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[04:33.15]Are you gonna try to get our intelligence?
[04:34.67]Is that what you're gonna try to do?
[04:35.63]Oh, you think you're gonna get the intelligence?
[04:38.42]That didn't kill him?
[04:43.62]Oh, that did.
[04:44.90]That did.
[04:45.34]Why am I getting achievements for this?
[04:48.33]I got, like, some type of journey to an achievement by doing that.
[04:52.27]I don't know how.
[04:54.10]Anybody in here?
[04:55.48]Yeah, there is.
[04:59.82]Are there any people down here?
[05:02.38]It's heavy.
[05:04.18]Just gotta be careful.
[05:06.10]Just gotta be careful.
[05:10.09]Yes!
[05:11.57]You too!
[05:12.05]No, you're not a spy.
[05:13.45]Thought you were a spy for a second.
[05:16.63]It's all about defending the intelligence as the Wrenchineer.
[05:23.00]Another Pyro.
[05:25.30]If you're gonna do the NG Wrench technique, then just be careful of Pyros.
[05:30.58]Pyroles?
[05:31.36]Did I say Pyro- Oh my god.
[05:34.36]Gotta move that gear up.
[05:40.99]You gotta move that gear up.
[05:47.15]Who wants it?
[05:48.81]Where'd he go?
[05:53.62]Two pyros.
[05:54.76]And a spy.
[05:55.70]And a spy.
[05:56.40]And a spy.
[05:57.00]And a spy.
[05:58.20]No, that didn't kill me.
[05:59.92]The sentry didn't kill me.
[06:02.81]Oh, I am so fucked right now.
[06:06.57]Yes!
[06:07.53]Oh my god!
[06:09.83]Oh my god.
[06:11.07]This guy.
[06:11.71]This engineer.
[06:12.33]Around the corner.
[06:12.97]Let's go.
[06:14.27]No, no, no.
[06:15.42]You come to me.
[06:16.97]I'm not, you're not gonna bait me around the corner to get killed by the sentry.
[06:20.75]Shit!
[06:22.45]Come on!
[06:25.76]God dammit, this guy is really good.
[06:27.40]I can't move.
[06:28.76]If I move around... There's nothing I could do there.
[06:33.52]The sentry would've killed me, because he's got a sentry on like the mountaintop.
[06:37.71]A mountain, but it's a house.
[06:39.23]What?
