[00:10.29]Yeah, let's not even go back there.
[00:13.49]I mean, this leaving Firestone one is level 18, and we're at level 18 and 19.
[00:22.49]Maybe we should just do it.
[00:23.61]Yeah, let's just do that one.
[00:25.33]I mean, we might as well change scenery anyways.
[00:27.43]Yeah.
[00:29.03]If it's what I think it is.
[00:31.01]Yep.
[00:31.33]Oh, that's the furthest away we've ever had to go.
[00:35.61]pretty much just a straight shot the whole way, too.
[00:37.57]I want to spawn us another card, because that one's a little bit beat up and stuff.
[00:41.27]I mean, we might as well switch a color.
[00:46.17]This one looks bland.
[00:48.83]I like the bland.
[00:51.62]So you're pretty much just going to go straight through here, left, and then take a right and then straight the entire way.
[00:56.76]Alright.
[01:01.74]Wait, around here?
[01:03.00]Yep, and then...
[01:04.94]Take a right.
[01:07.56]And now you're going to literally go straight until we get there.
[01:11.24]This is a smooth Sunday ride.
[01:13.54]Yep.
[01:14.12]Smooth Sunday drive.
[01:18.64]I love the boost.
[01:20.74]It is awesome.
[01:21.56]Oh shit!
[01:23.66]That thing just shot up.
[01:28.11]Keep going.
[01:30.79]We have some stuff here we can collect, though.
[01:34.62]We do.
[01:37.30]Okay, fine.
[01:38.02]Why not?
[01:38.36]Might as well, right?
[01:39.32]Yeah.
[01:41.04]Hey, we've been getting lucky recently.
[01:44.86]We got, like, ammo and stuff from those.
[01:47.64]Hell yeah.
[01:48.88]I mean, um, weapons.
[01:49.80]We got even some from...
[01:51.89]missing who's it's a while there's a lot of damage but so it's better elemental damage on it explosive damage did you buy that explosive one yeah we just hop out here really quickly because there's another just right there
[02:20.98]It's a bomb.
[02:22.22]That was useful.
[02:25.42]Yes, it looks like we're leaving Firestone.
[02:27.34]Goodbye, Firestone.
[02:28.58]Nice to know you.
[02:30.72]Have you ever seen the Lost series?
[02:34.46]I think maybe one episode, maybe two episodes.
[02:37.65]There's like this force field that they make.
[02:40.41]It reminded me, those pillars reminded me of it.
[02:42.19]Ooh, what is that?
[02:45.71]Incendiary bouncing buddy.
[02:48.53]I still like my other one.
[02:52.37]I'm definitely buying this new shield, absolutely.
[03:02.21]260 capacity shield.
[03:05.29]That's insane.
[03:07.09]Oh, it's sold out.
[03:07.87]Yeah, I bought it.
[03:09.76]I scooped it up.
[03:11.62]Nice.
[03:14.08]You have 118 bucks there, nice.
[03:17.32]Hey, what do we have here?
[03:21.32]It's another hundred, almost.
[03:24.67]Let's talk to Mr. Claptrap.
[03:30.09]Human status confirmed!
[03:37.81]For a second, I thought he just blew up.
[03:39.55]I was like, wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.
[03:42.41]How will he react to just a fire force field right in front of him?
[03:49.06]Let's go.
[03:54.16]That's good.
[03:55.78]Doll Headland.
[03:57.19]I see guys that are in cars.
[03:59.57]Yeah, this could be quite interesting.
[04:02.55]Alright, do we have a car somewhere around here?
[04:05.49]We have a checkpoint.
[04:06.47]Looks like we just have to go right.
[04:08.39]We have to find Ernest.
[04:09.57]Yeah, he's like right here.
[04:10.93]According to the map, he's right to our left.
[04:12.59]I think once we walk up here.
[04:24.29]Alright.
[04:25.21]Are we getting shot at?
[04:26.39]No, I just clicked because I have ADD.
[04:28.81]I have to click sometimes.
[04:30.17]No problem.
[04:33.38]It's the same way.
[04:34.02]A lot of people ask me why.
[04:35.36]Oh, look at this art style, dude.
[04:37.58]I like that.
[04:38.08]That's fantastic.
[04:38.84]What were you going to say?
[04:40.22]Well, I was going to say a lot of people ask me why I don't use the fast switch in Team Fortress.
[04:46.18]And it's because I click so many times.
[04:47.80]I'm a compulsive clicker and mover that I just accidentally hit weapons all the time when I do fast switch.
[04:54.42]they are just who do we get some emissions we'd only have a nice jump on looking forward to this your weight at the switch right you know and this is why it was right for rounds in the toilet don't ask me how they got there ernest the fifth ernest I don't know what we had jumped to a that's going to be crazy
[05:22.57]Oh, I gotta get in the car.
[05:23.93]Oh, yeah.
[05:24.77]My bad.
[05:25.27]Alright, you ready?
[05:27.75]Let's go.

[05:44.18]Oh, we gotta go down.
[05:46.30]Turn around.

[13:29.23]And a Surplus Rifle.
[13:30.67]Okay.
[13:32.09]Pick up the Incendiary one just in any case, because it's got good stuff.
[13:36.14]It sells for a lot.
[13:38.02]And this one, this Surplus Rifle, you wanna take that or you want me to grab it?
[13:41.56]Nah, it's not even worth a lot.
[13:43.82]Yeah, you're right.

[14:37.93]Holy crap!
[14:42.71]It has a chance to corrode enemies.
[14:45.13]It's a scoped Hornet.
[14:47.39]It's 51,000 to buy.
[14:49.54]I wish I had $20,000 right now, because I would buy this sniper class mod.
[14:56.07]65% sniper rifle.
[14:57.98]Oh, I should definitely buy that.
[14:59.44]It's an incendiary SMG.
[15:01.66]God.
[15:02.02]Well, what's the difference between these two?
[15:05.18]I don't know.
[15:10.37]Yeah, this other incendiary SMG is better.
[15:15.65]Yeah, I'm going to buy that.
[15:17.53]I'm going to sell the other one.
[15:21.32]Incendiary Repeater goes bye-bye.

[15:27.02]For what?
[15:28.56]A new mod.
[15:30.44]Nice.

[15:40.61]Nice, man.
[15:41.43]That's insanity.
[15:46.46]buy a couple kits.
[15:49.25]I wanna equip this thing so I don't sell it away by accident.
