[00:14.02]Bye.
[00:15.87]Bye.
[00:20.79]hello everyone and welcome back to tip of the hats 2016. we are in day two here and with your help uh everybody at home we have raised over 104 000 for one step camp a great cause and you know we're not done yet we have many things going on in this upcoming hour we have a man in a box we have a man with a camera strapped to his head so the excitement is just getting started and frankly I don't know what's going to happen uh there are two maniacs here
[00:50.39]ready to go for your enjoyment and your viewing pleasure.
[00:53.95]And I believe we have Sideshow in a box behind me.
[00:58.42]Hello?
[00:58.90]Are you there?
[01:00.26]There he is.
[01:01.12]Hi.
[01:02.68]Yeah.
[01:04.00]How are you doing over there?
[01:06.14]I can just about breathe and that's all that matters.
[01:11.31]Okay.
[01:12.31]What are you playing with?
[01:14.45]What am I playing with?
[01:14.94]Yeah.
[01:21.08]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:28.14]You know what would be really cool, though?
[01:29.06]It would be really cool if we had some sort of a free cam, some way to possibly see you from a different angle.
[01:35.55]Maybe a friend of ours can help us out, possibly.
[01:38.35]Jerma, Jerma, are you there?
[01:39.45]Come in.
[01:39.89]Yeah, I am here.
[01:41.09]Currently, I just want to make sure that the facility is all still.
[01:43.30]This is very important hardware work.
[01:45.08]I'm going to make sure these lights are turned on.
[01:46.90]They are.
[01:47.30]One, two, three, all on.
[01:48.52]I think we've got that under control.
[01:50.04]So I think I can take my seat.
[01:51.41]One, two, three.
[01:51.93]Yeah, we got it.
[01:53.09]Let me just take a little walk over here.
[01:54.29]Let me just like get over here.
[01:55.66]Just walk like, you know, going over the, and then we got, hey, is this Box Guy?
[01:59.64]Box Guy.
[02:01.14]I'm joining you, Box Guy.
[02:02.37]Are you coming to play?
[02:04.31]I guess you could call it that.
[02:05.33]Let's try to get behind you.
[02:07.33]I need a friend.
[02:08.57]I can't go in any further.
[02:09.95]Okay.
[02:10.68]My face is on the screen.
[02:11.48]Okay, we rehearsed that one.
[02:13.74]Alright.
[02:15.50]I was kicked due to inactivity.
[02:18.04]Oh, look at that.
[02:18.79]That's just too bad.
[02:20.65]Yeah, I got to get this pointed down so you can see my hand reacting.
[02:27.10]What are you up to there?
[02:28.56]What are you doing?
[02:29.46]You just retrying.
[02:31.29]Can I even see you?
[02:32.71]I have no idea.
[02:33.67]This is an arm hole.
[02:34.83]I don't think you're supposed to look through arm holes.
[02:36.53]No, you're not.
[02:37.27]How are you going to play in that?
[02:38.38]You have a controller in your hand.
[02:39.70]I've got a controller in here.
[02:40.72]It's limited movement, I'm not going to lie, but I'm warm.
[02:45.04]You're going to be like so hot in that thing?
[02:47.98]Yeah, it's pretty warm.
[02:49.50]That's like a mascot suit.
[02:51.23]It's normally pretty toasty in Chicago anyway, I guess, compared to where I'm from.
[02:55.57]But this is something else.
[02:57.34]Can you see my hands?
[02:59.78]I got to put this on.
[03:01.72]Alright, now I'm ready to game.
[03:03.85]What?
[03:04.47]I am connected to like so many wires right now.
[03:06.97]You have no idea.
[03:08.32]This wire is going all over the body in places that I don't even want to describe.
[03:12.94]You know what I'm saying?
[03:14.20]What am I going on?
[03:14.76]Red team?
[03:15.90]And we are.
[03:17.29]I'm on blue team.
[03:17.89]Oh, I'm going to go on the same team you're on.
[03:19.47]Come with me.
[03:20.23]I'm coming.
[03:21.33]We'll rule the skies together.
[03:24.13]We'll rule the skies together.
[03:26.52]How do I change team?
[03:29.36]Oh, there we go.
[03:29.78]There we go.
[03:30.44]It's pretty difficult with the controller, but I...
[03:32.20]Can we get a microphone around Jerma?
[03:36.49]Can you not hear me?
[03:38.52]I can hear you.
[03:40.49]Can anybody else hear me?
[03:41.37]I have to stay on red.
[03:45.77]Wait, can you hear me now?
[03:46.37]Guys, hate to interrupt so early on, but we have a $1,000 donation that just came in.
[03:50.25]Of course, putting us over that $105,000 threshold.
[03:54.36]And I think with that, we can get things going to reach $1,010 by the end of the night.
[03:59.48]Of course, we are going to $11,000 CST.
[04:02.36]So guys, the challenge is on.
[04:04.43]Get on it.
[04:05.49]Thank you for that.
[04:07.67]Are you in now?
[04:08.27]Yeah, but I can't.
[04:08.81]There's too many people on the team.
[04:10.59]Who are you?
[04:11.47]Who are you?
[04:13.29]I'm Darren.
[04:14.64]Where are you?
[04:15.81]I'm currently on the red team.
[04:17.75]You're on red?
[04:18.79]Yeah.
[04:19.43]There's too many people on the other team.
[04:20.81]There's too many human beings.
[04:22.40]Alright.
[04:22.70]Okay.
[04:23.64]I'm going.
[04:24.10]Alright.
[04:24.36]Don't worry.
[04:24.72]I took care of that dispenser.
[04:25.82]Got you.
[04:26.66]Wait.
[04:26.80]You're on the blue team.
[04:27.62]I shouldn't be saying that.
[04:28.54]Don't worry.
[04:29.22]I'm going spy so I can roll.
[04:30.39]Hold on a second.
[04:30.85]Let me do a sticky jump.
[04:32.53]How do I taunt?
[04:33.33]Hold on.
[04:33.67]I didn't do the sticky jump.
[04:34.87]Alright.
[04:35.31]There we go.
[04:36.80]I got it.
[04:37.22]No, I didn't.
[04:38.96]This guy wants to mess around.
[04:40.22]I'll get him with a bottle.
[04:43.49]I'm on tag's account here.
[04:44.51]Other than just...
[04:47.02]In case you guys wanna see what I'm doing here, let's make sure we get a good mouse cam, you know what I'm saying?
[04:53.92]Getting so many kills!
[04:54.84]Ooh, lucky seven jackpot!
[05:06.19]Lucky, why did I, wait, wasn't I just Darren?
[05:10.24]Wait, what is going on?
[05:12.09]Are you Darren?
[05:14.39]Who's Darren?
[05:15.23]That's like, I thought I was Darren.
[05:18.17]Identity crisis over on the gamer table.
[05:20.70]I seriously thought that I was Darren.
[05:22.44]That's like my name right now.
[05:25.16]Alright, what do we got?
[05:29.16]Can you get on blue?
[05:31.99]I'll take care of it for you.
[05:36.55]I taunted.
[05:38.31]Did I get kicked?
[05:38.89]No, I'm still there.
[05:44.32]Someone is about to draw a face on my box.
[05:49.88]I'm sorry to interrupt this whole thing here.
[05:52.20]You need to be happy.
[05:54.02]I don't want to be upset or anything, but I don't have any refreshments in front of me right now, and it's kind of making me a little bit annoyed.
[06:02.37]I want two Coca-Cola Classics in the small bottles, and I want them now, and I want one of them opened.
[06:14.77]demands from our men.
[06:16.70]Jerma over here.
[06:17.68]I don't know whether we have those in the building.
[06:20.28]Are we drawing something or did I get my Coca-Cola classics?
[06:22.55]Thank you very much.
[06:23.37]One of them has to be open.
[06:25.87]Are we drawing a face on you?
[06:26.90]I think so.
[06:28.04]Do we have a pen?
[06:28.84]Oh, there's a golden pen over there.
[06:34.47]Thank you very much.
[06:35.43]That's what I was talking about.
[06:37.62]deal with those later.
[06:38.89]Is it me drawing it?
[06:39.85]I think so.
[06:40.71]A smiley face?
[06:41.63]I don't know.
[06:42.59]Anything you like.
[06:43.43]Can I have mochas coming out of your nose?
[06:44.87]I really can't control what you're doing.
[06:46.22]I can't even stop you if I wanted to.
[06:48.70]Okay.
[06:49.56]No, I'm going to get ink on you if you do that.
[06:51.32]Don't do that, sir.
[06:52.79]There's only very small parts of me that are exposed anyway.
[06:56.09]This is your nose.
[06:56.67]This is going to be your mouth.
[07:01.36]This looks like my starting suit in stream title.
[07:07.21]Looks like elbow.
[07:10.69]Gotta get some hair on you, too.
[07:13.62]Get some hair on there.
[07:15.44]I'll give you a beard, too.
[07:16.46]I'll give you like a sick goatee.
[07:19.51]Always wanted a beard.
[07:20.65]And a big, yeah, it goes all the way around like this.
[07:24.28]Neither one of us has played the game in about three minutes.
[07:27.74]While we get Sideshow's face on, I want to read a donation that came through from our item donation.
[07:34.11]Of course, you guys can donate items, and it goes directly to cash.
[07:37.36]And this one is from Ghost Food.
[07:39.62]Ghost Food with a $27.53 donation via item says, won the unusual in a raffle.
[07:46.73]I'm giving it back.
[07:48.23]So, of course, we are having those giveaways for you guys, which is totally free.
[07:50.98]You just enter in, and you are eligible to win an item directly.
[07:53.66]This man right here at Ghost Food won an unusual and he gave it right back in for a value of $27.
[07:58.13]So thank you so much.
[07:59.87]Thanks a lot, dude.
[08:00.41]Sacho, do you have a face yet?
[08:02.03]I think I do.
[08:04.40]Yeah, you do.
[08:05.16]It looks like somebody threw up on you.
[08:07.82]It doesn't even look like a face.
[08:09.06]I tried.
[08:10.83]That's not very good.
[08:12.05]You're not known for your artistic talents.
[08:14.13]Hold on a second.
[08:14.65]Let me just take a nice sip of this delicious plain cola beverage.
[08:19.42]I think I already said the brand, but let's just get a good sip of this here.
[08:25.35]That was fantastic.
[08:30.40]Can I get a coffee, too, please?
[08:32.62]I would take a coffee.
[08:36.29]I would like it filled up halfway.
[08:39.25]None of this filled up like three quarters.
[08:41.37]That's disgusting.
[08:43.74]There better be nothing in it, either.
[08:45.92]You'll see me get infuriated.
[08:49.82]Where are we going here?
[08:51.37]Are we on the same team yet or not?
[08:52.75]I'm with you.
[08:53.19]I'm healing you.
[08:54.04]Oh, you... Thank you very much.
[08:59.29]Thank you very much.
[09:01.59]Let me just get a good little sip of this coffee here.
[09:09.02]That was way too hot!
[09:10.96]It's burning me.
[09:12.36]Now, Jerma, is this a typical demonstration of the life, of what it is to be you?
[09:18.19]Yeah, it's pretty depressing, isn't it?
[09:20.41]I don't know, you have your own servants.
[09:21.89]I'm just like...
[09:23.47]Where am I going?
[09:25.13]Where's my mouse?
[09:25.85]Where's my hands?
[09:29.62]Alright, we need to do like a tag team here.
[09:31.86]Right.
[09:32.64]What should we be here?
[09:34.67]You're a demoman.
[09:36.51]Alright, just heal the absolute dump out of me.
[09:39.97]Alright, I need to modify my loadout here, clearly, because we need some crates up in this.
[09:44.92]I got killed.
[09:45.56]Where are we?
[09:47.68]Oh, that's a crop drop.
[09:48.53]Your vision is like looking through a hotel door.
[09:54.80]I find that pretty funny.
[09:57.44]Can I get in there, too?
[09:59.00]Is there room for two people in there?
[10:06.49]Now, Sasha, I don't know what the box has done to your microphone, but I can hear you rattling inside my brain.
[10:16.02]You are so loud.
[10:18.84]Where is this even pointing?
[10:20.00]Let's make sure.
[10:20.52]Is this pointing at the screen?
[10:22.28]Oh, I just got knocked off the cliff.
[10:25.11]The box is also just directly buttoned onto my crotch.
[10:29.19]Oh, okay.
[10:30.54]You're going to have to go in behind me.
[10:33.16]Well, that's how we do things.
[10:35.44]He really is attached.
[10:36.54]It really is buttoned onto my crotch, yeah.
[10:38.49]What is this?
[10:39.47]This is a fan in case it gets too warm in there.
[10:42.31]This looks like one of those things you bring to smash up grapes.
[10:48.07]Yeah, Grand Smasher.
[10:49.21]That's exactly what it looks like.
[10:50.59]Isn't this a fan?
[10:51.64]It's a fan.
[10:52.68]This is not a fan.
[10:55.59]There's nothing coming out of there.
[10:57.48]And why is it changing colors?
[11:00.67]Oh, is that a battery?
[11:02.29]Hey guys, $10 from One Step Counselor says, as a volunteer for One Step, thank you so much to everyone who donated.
[11:09.25]I've been a counselor for quite a few years now.
[11:11.41]People like you make a huge difference in my campus lives.
[11:14.03]It's truly the happiest place on Earth.
[11:16.08]I get to see the difference it makes.
[11:17.56]We have been growing and adding more programs because of the donations we receive.
[11:22.29]one step couldn't be as awesome as it is without your help and guys that's to you at home because of your help we have been able to make a difference in the lives of so many so keep those donations coming they go to a great cause better than having this man in a box that's you we're about to both get in the box so you gotta qualify I don't think there's I don't think there's enough room in that box
[11:47.03]I looked at the piece of orange tape that was connected to you.
[11:50.85]I don't think I want to disturb that.
[11:53.29]You don't have to disturb the orange tape.
[11:55.10]You can just slink in behind.
[11:57.38]Alright.
[11:58.56]Jonah in arm holes.
[12:01.30]Should I be one arm?
[12:03.45]Oh, where are you at?
[12:04.51]Oh, there you are.
[12:05.71]Okay, I'm with you now.
[12:06.31]Alright, we're finally together?
[12:07.19]We're finally together.
[12:07.93]Okay, you ready?
[12:09.03]Okay, you got an enemy.
[12:10.62]Don't worry, I'll get him.
[12:11.88]I didn't get him.
[12:12.86]I didn't get him.
[12:13.70]I didn't switch fast enough to my melee weapon.
[12:16.86]I'll wait for you.
[12:17.48]Oh, no, no.
[12:17.72]You know, we're gonna do the real, the real class here.
[12:21.77]How do I get out of that?
[12:23.56]I'm gonna be, uh, I'm gonna be heavy.
[12:26.28]I'm hearing there's a bomb in the lasagna.
[12:28.97]Now, we were gonna have lasagna for dinner, so... How am I gonna change if we go...
[12:35.44]Alright, here we go.
[12:37.14]We're doing the one-two, okay?
[12:40.25]I know you and I are both connected to various devices, and it's not the most ideal in situations, but we're going to get at least five or six people in a row right here, okay?
[12:50.43]So you've got to listen to all of my commands.
[12:51.97]And by the way, don't touch those sodas, just in case you're curious.
[12:55.93]I'm with you.
[12:56.43]I don't know how the fuck you were, actually.
[12:59.21]One.
[12:59.31]Two.
[13:00.07]We did it.
[13:00.72]Three.
[13:01.64]Oh, I can suddenly hear myself as well.
[13:03.16]Oh, wow.
[13:03.74]I sound awful in this box.
[13:04.98]Well, you can hear yourself.
[13:06.49]Oh, you're dead.
[13:07.25]Why can't I hear you?
[13:08.41]Huh?
[13:08.77]I can hear you now.
[13:10.25]Wow.
[13:10.55]Is that not a good thing?
[13:11.99]No, it's fine.
[13:12.47]It's good.
[13:13.09]You don't want to be able to hear me?
[13:14.26]No, I like it.
[13:15.18]It works.
[13:16.10]The box is also a noise isolation device.
[13:19.58]Leave me in here.
[13:20.26]Oh, it is.
[13:20.80]Let me tell you.
[13:21.68]Sensory deprivation.
[13:22.69]I can't believe that you sound so different in that box than you do outside from listening.
[13:28.41]Yeah, there's... It's not the best acoustics.
[13:31.76]You know, people, when they're building studios and things, they don't normally... Well, I guess a room is a box.
[13:37.24]It's just bigger.
[13:38.60]I guess everyone lives in a box.
[13:39.93]You're Frank Pizza.
[13:40.99]I love it.
[13:42.13]Why do I have like three separate usernames in this server?
[13:45.58]Help, help, help.
[13:46.94]Turn around, help.
[13:47.68]You gotta call it out.
[13:49.11]I'm so weak.
[13:49.97]Hold on, I don't have a sandwich for you.
[13:51.83]Do you have a sandwich?
[13:52.45]No, I have a shotgun.
[13:54.54]You have a shotgun.
[13:55.18]Watch this one.
[13:55.98]You have a shotgun.
[13:58.30]My cable got caught up.
[13:59.90]And I'm connected to, like, 60 wires.
[14:01.54]Yeah, blame the cable.
[14:03.36]So you have the easy job.
[14:04.61]You sacrifice me.
[14:05.45]So you get to be in a box.
[14:07.47]And you get to, like, hide in there.
[14:08.59]I get to be in the box.
[14:09.87]See, I get to look like a total dinghy.
[14:12.82]I was forced to be in the box.
[14:14.48]I wish I could be in that box.
[14:16.86]One of the conditions of me being here was that I had to be in the box.
[14:20.69]I managed to wangle it so that I was only in here for a short segment of time.
[14:23.73]How am I getting headshot?
[14:24.93]Where are you?
[14:25.47]There you are.
[14:26.87]Don't screw this up this time.
[14:29.26]You're the one that screwed it up.
[14:31.73]Not me.
[14:32.76]I haven't screwed up anything.
[14:34.66]I'm with you.
[14:35.64]I'm giving them the jukes.
[14:36.76]$100 from Nate Fox says, Hi, guys.
[14:39.43]I'm so happy I could participate in this year's Tip of the Hats.
[14:42.11]It's great to see all of the work that goes into this event.
[14:44.91]So shout-outs to you guys who are giving your time to make this possible.
[14:47.58]Let's destroy cancer just like Tag gets destroyed in Ulti Duo.
[14:53.00]You guys can see Tag in the back there, part of the production crew, breaking the fourth wall.
[14:57.67]He's getting ripped on for no reason whatsoever by our donators.
[15:01.60]Sad little face.
[15:03.22]He didn't deserve that.
[15:04.04]Well, he did.
[15:04.62]I mean, he did get stalled on enough.
[15:05.93]He deserves to be called out for his terrible play.
[15:08.83]When you switch to the cam up here, like, what are you seeing right now?
[15:13.72]I gotta make it, like, interesting.
[15:15.82]We see the set and part of production.
[15:19.37]Okay, let's go down here.
[15:22.33]So now we see the screen.
[15:23.45]Alright, what about now?
[15:25.42]Well, among other things, we see your keyboard in your hands.
[15:29.32]Maybe a little too low.
[15:31.63]Did you know that this box also doubles as a vending machine?
[15:34.23]What?
[15:35.65]Yeah.
[15:36.15]If you put some change in the slot, you get fruit out the eye holes.
[15:39.46]Anybody got a quarter?
[15:40.72]Fruit in eye holes.
[15:41.56]I think it'll accept bottle caps as well.
[15:43.91]How about a full bottle of refreshing cola?
[15:45.63]Yeah, yeah, just put that in here.
[15:46.71]Just right in my eyes.
[15:47.71]There you go.
[15:48.45]Yeah, just right in there.
[15:49.94]And it gets exchanged for fruit.
[15:51.98]Oh, wow.
[15:52.96]Excellent.
[15:53.82]No, no, not the fruit in.
[15:55.13]Fruit doesn't go in.
[15:56.11]No, the fruit doesn't go in.
[15:57.23]Fruit goes out.
[15:58.43]No, that's not... That doesn't work that way.
[16:01.41]Yeah, that's how it's supposed to be.
[16:03.60]That's how the box works.
[16:04.98]Let's go back to the apple.
[16:05.88]Hey, we got an apple here.
[16:07.18]Delicious.
[16:07.98]We're not going to do the banana coming out.
[16:11.30]Yeah, the banana belongs there.
[16:12.75]That's how it's supposed to be.
[16:14.41]It looks like a horn.
[16:16.41]I'm just role-playing as the Balloonicorn right now.
[16:20.89]Just a very cheap cosplay of a Balloonicorn.
[16:23.56]That's all we could afford this year.
[16:25.34]A cardboard box and a banana.
[16:28.40]If you've got any better ideas, please send them in.
[16:31.35]This is constraining my blood vessels to my brain.
[16:34.98]It's squeezing me.
[16:37.75]Where are we going now?
[16:38.88]I can't.
[16:39.98]You know, you guys did this at home.
[16:41.38]You donated for this to happen.
[16:44.28]So this is all your fault, thankfully.
[16:46.08]And if you guys want to get in on another incentive goal, we will have the Scout voice actor here and will play Scout in the voice of the Scout.
[16:55.29]He will play a character if you guys get in on that incentive.
[16:58.19]So when you donate, go to the donations page on the right side.
[17:01.32]You can add towards that incentive.
[17:02.78]But what is going on on stream right now?
[17:04.94]Sideshow, what are you doing?
[17:05.92]Get it off.
[17:06.48]Just eyes in arm holes.
[17:08.46]Just making full use of the holes of the box as to their full potential, because I can't actually turn, because the wall's in the way a little bit, and my pants are strapped to the box, so we don't have the same kind of rotation as we'd love.
[17:22.26]Oh, Koth, King of the Hill Koth, I love this map.
[17:24.55]Alright, see if you can join Blue, because I'm using a controller, and I can't actually select teams.
[17:28.55]Okay.
[17:31.11]I'm on Blue.
[17:32.20]Are you on Blue, too?
[17:33.22]I am on Blue team.
[17:35.04]Alright, I'm going to be the sniper.
[17:37.35]Check out these headshots, man.
[17:39.78]Okay.
[17:40.38]You snipe people.
[17:41.28]I'll run in and finish them off with a ham.
[17:43.86]Because that seems like a... Just only heal me.
[17:46.07]Wait, are you not healing?
[17:52.25]Are you healing or no?
[17:53.78]Am I what?
[17:54.26]Am I healing you?
[17:55.64]Sideshare can't even hear him.
[17:57.10]No, this box, it really does block a lot of the sound.
[18:01.01]Where are you?
[18:01.97]I'm on the left flank.
[18:03.17]Oh, you're on the left.
[18:03.87]Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
[18:04.55]I'm protecting you.
[18:05.97]Check this.
[18:06.41]And by protecting... I mean... I mean, I did just die.
[18:14.24]The important thing is that we died together.
[18:16.10]We did, yeah.
[18:16.52]The important thing is... We synced our spawns up so that we can get back in the fight at the same time.
[18:22.27]Helping our team.
[18:23.43]I got to at least show a couple head shooting, you know?
[18:29.30]I was going to say, you have a great Nintendo 64 mod on your computer.
[18:32.90]Okay, here we go.
[18:34.27]Here we go.
[18:35.27]We've got the crits on you.
[18:36.17]Thanks, Frank Pizza.
[18:37.39]Sideshow, are you still playing TF2 with a controller?
[18:39.73]I am.
[18:40.17]Yeah, the controller, I mean... How's that working out for you?
[18:42.18]You can see... I still got the controller going on, you know?
[18:45.42]I keep forgetting you're doing that.
[18:46.85]You only need... You only actually need one hand to play with the controller, you know?
[18:50.75]Because you can just... Like, just multitask like that.
[18:53.66]You just walk forward.
[18:54.70]Why am I standing on the point?
[18:55.82]Switch weapons a few times.
[18:57.06]Accidentally taunt.
[18:58.32]Oh, crap.
[19:01.52]Well, guys, we have a $117.60 donation via the donations, the item donations, coming from Zach McRaffle.
[19:10.93]Says, is there a better way to celebrate 7,000 hours in TF2 than giving something back for such a good cause?
[19:17.94]Thanks to everyone involved in this great event.
[19:19.88]Shout out to TF2 Center.
[19:22.06]And say hi to Jill from me.
[19:23.55]Hi, Jill, from that guy.
[19:25.31]Thank you.
[19:26.33]Thank you.
[19:26.75]Hey.
[19:27.98]Now, where did you get up to?
[19:30.51]I'm on the top.
[19:31.35]Where did you take your little self?
[19:32.57]Oh, I see you.
[19:33.79]No, I currently got crit attacked.
[19:38.12]Well, don't worry because we've got our crits of our own.
[19:39.84]We'll just meet up here on the middle path and I'll find you.
[19:44.76]I've got to get like seven headshots.
[19:48.13]There's a heavy hut in there.
[19:50.07]I completely forgot about that.
[19:53.48]I thought it was just on Facebook over there.
[19:55.64]I'm not sure if you can hear me.
[19:57.24]Where you at?
[19:57.83]There you are.
[19:58.79]Alright.
[20:00.01]You're gonna crit-scrape me, and I'm just gonna body-shot people and then pretend I got headshots.
[20:03.91]It's gonna be great.
[20:05.19]It's gonna be fantastic.
[20:06.28]Say the word.
[20:11.46]Okay, in three, two... Nope, don't do it.
[20:17.13]Okay, in five, four, three...
[20:23.69]Five, four, do it!
[20:30.84]This is working very well so far.
[20:34.62]And there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:37.63]Got that scout.
[20:39.17]Is he alive again?
[20:40.61]What just happened?
[20:41.37]Finest use of a crit streak I've ever seen.
[20:43.22]Where'd you go?
[20:44.28]Hold on, we're just gonna do this strategy here.
[20:47.78]You're dead.
[20:48.28]I did get a couple of the same scout.
[20:50.45]He appeared three times.
[20:53.10]It's the old triple scout maneuver.
[20:56.57]Hey, guys, a comment for that $1,000 donation did just come in from shrublord at jumpacademy.tf says, draw a mask on the box or by my own power, I will send a Glue Man to do it himself.
[21:09.47]Well, I think we already have a face on that box.
[21:12.11]I don't know if that qualifies.
[21:13.71]What's a mask?
[21:15.42]I don't know.
[21:16.51]Did you see how shoddy the face is?
[21:18.99]It was quite difficult.
[21:20.25]Whoa.
[21:21.51]Shoddy.
[21:22.21]You said it.
[21:23.10]You said it, not me.
[21:23.96]I never said that.
[21:25.38]Now, where are you now?
[21:26.68]Because I got another crit.
[21:27.50]Oh, there you are.
[21:27.88]There's too many fast scouts.
[21:29.66]And I'm dead.
[21:31.10]All you have to do is click on them once with their crits, and they're going to die.
[21:34.43]I'm being waved at.
[21:35.41]You could go... I'm going heavy.
[21:37.29]And then you're going to crit me.
[21:38.89]And I'm just going to hold the mouse button down, and we're just going to ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[21:44.37]You know what that sound is?
[21:46.43]Yep, that is the sound of a Lucky 7 jackpot.
[21:51.14]Exactly.
[21:52.84]Alright, you got 100%?
[21:53.90]I am.
[21:54.83]I'm here.
[21:55.35]I'm ready.
[21:55.85]I'm ready to rumble.
[21:58.09]Ready to rumble.
[21:59.13]That's the name of the game.
[22:04.38]Once we get out here.
[22:07.85]And... Do it!
[22:12.21]And there's a one.
[22:13.25]And there's a two.
[22:14.64]And there's a three.
[22:16.88]And there's a four.
[22:18.55]Oh, asshole.
[22:19.51]Oh, let's make it five.
[22:20.55]And we win.
[22:21.45]You know, that's how easy it is.
[22:23.16]That's how easy it is.
[22:25.56]Here's one from anonymous.
[22:26.96]$4.20.
[22:29.01]Not sure what the significance of that is, but says it costs
[22:31.53]$400,000 to receive donations for 12 seconds.
[22:35.42]Also, you are one of my favorite YouTubers, Jerma.
[22:38.62]Please keep making us donate by showing your beautiful face.
[22:42.91]Keep fighting the good fight.
[22:44.61]Tip of the hat.
[22:45.93]Thank you, Anonymous.
[22:47.47]And Jerma and Sideshow, could you guys maybe, I don't know, what do you guys know about the donations going on here?
[22:52.96]Maybe you can inform some of our viewers.
[22:54.64]I don't know if Sideshow, if you're able to do that while stuck within the confines of a box.
[22:57.84]Are you in the confines of a box?
[22:59.24]I am still in the confines of the box.
[23:01.43]But if you guys want to donate, then you can donate by going to tipthehands.org.
[23:06.23]And you can click either... I forgot what it is.
[23:09.61]What is it?
[23:10.52]Cash or TF2 items.
[23:12.50]That's the one.
[23:13.24]You can donate TF2 items as well.
[23:15.14]You can donate your keys and your australiums and your other things.
[23:19.23]Tickets.
[23:19.67]Little tickets and things.
[23:21.03]and you can also donate your Unusuals.
[23:25.19]From today, we're accepting Unusuals and they get converted by the machinery of the back end of Marketplace.tf into sweet, juicy cash and they go straight to One Step Camp.
[23:38.22]That is amazing, by the way.
[23:40.40]I never thought it would be possible to see items being contributed that turn directly into money.
[23:46.07]It's really quite magical.
[23:47.77]That is very magical.
[23:48.68]So here's what we're going to do.
[23:50.96]I'm just going to get out there and we're going to get to their spawn, okay?
[23:53.74]Yep.
[23:54.35]Okay.
[23:54.71]I'm just going to hide for now so that I don't die.
[23:56.67]So keep me alive at all.
[23:58.99]Wait, are you not medic anymore?
[24:00.02]Yeah, I'm still medic.
[24:00.92]I'm on the left.
[24:01.62]I'm ready.
[24:01.98]I'm waiting.
[24:02.90]Alright.
[24:03.12]Here we go.
[24:04.06]I just sat there.
[24:05.41]Wait, are you on the red team?
[24:06.55]Yes.
[24:07.45]Since when did you get on the red team?
[24:09.13]I don't know how that happened.
[24:10.65]So when you say we're going to get to their spawn, you mean you're going to spawn on me?
[24:13.24]I'm going to get to your spawn.
[24:14.88]It's going to happen.
[24:15.54]No one's even paying attention.
[24:16.76]Okay.
[24:19.40]Somebody paid attention.
[24:21.11]I'm just stuck on an island.
[24:23.41]So you're on blue?
[24:24.43]Yeah, I'm on blue.
[24:25.13]Alright, I'm switching teams.
[24:26.01]Was I not on blue the whole time?
[24:28.21]How did I get on?
[24:29.12]Did I switch to red somehow, like magically?
[24:32.30]I have no idea, but we are slamming your team.
[24:34.30]Oh, out of balance.
[24:35.75]Who did that?
[24:36.41]Alright, fine.
[24:37.59]I have a hat, apparently.
[24:39.34]Do I have a hat, Joe?
[24:40.84]It's a penguin.
[24:41.92]It's a penguin.
[24:42.65]Yeah.
[24:43.89]Don't lose that.
[24:44.57]Penguin banana hat.
[24:48.42]Is there a penguin hat in TF2?
[24:51.38]I don't think so.
[24:53.57]Is there what animal hats there is a penguin thing that you hang on your belt?

[27:18.66]Should we expect it?
[27:21.85]Is it coming up?
[27:24.35]You don't want to give it away.
[27:25.41]You don't want to put all your cards on the table.
[27:26.63]I don't want to give it away.
[27:28.25]You might see a campaign slogan here in the next few weeks.
[27:32.34]Is that a spy?
[27:33.30]I don't think so.
[27:33.84]Okay, I'm on you.
[27:34.98]You've got this.

[27:44.80]Wait, wait, wait.
[27:45.72]Don't get too hasty here.
[27:48.45]We're not going to even have time to build this thing up unless we go balls deep, you know?
[27:53.49]Oh, here we go.
[27:54.93]I've just got 25%.

[28:04.25]There's a soldier behind you.
[28:05.11]What?
[28:05.33]Where?
[28:05.63]Save me.
[28:05.95]Save my life before I lose this.
[28:06.73]We've got him, boys.
[28:07.53]You are an absolute madman.
[28:10.10]Let me just give you a little bit of a buff here.
[28:11.42]Don't worry.
[28:12.20]Okay.
[28:12.34]We've both got Arubas as well.
[28:14.02]Do you want to go first?
[28:15.26]I'll pop it off on you.
[28:16.65]We've got a scout right there.
[28:18.69]Where's he going?
[28:19.27]I don't know, but I have one.
[28:21.21]There's too many scouts.
[28:24.22]It's up to you.
[28:27.89]Oh, no, no, no.
[28:29.01]We got to blow her.
[28:30.15]He's blowing me.
[28:30.68]He's blowing me up.
[28:31.98]He's air blowing me.
[28:33.57]He's not letting me play.
[28:35.67]He's just doing this.
[28:36.43]He's just having a grand old time.
[28:38.38]I made it out.
[28:39.70]I didn't make it out.
[28:40.52]Stabby just passed that.
[28:42.00]Stabby, Stabby, you know.
[28:42.90]We had a run.
[28:43.56]We had a good run.
[28:44.48]We had a decent run.
[28:45.67]We had a good run.
[28:46.41]Speaking of Stabby, $77 from Stabby with the donation says, My own personal knife and ambi, that's ambassador if you don't know.
[28:54.26]They've done me well.
[28:55.24]Much love.
[28:56.32]You all and the kids.
[28:58.18]Heart, Stabby.
[28:59.62]Thank you, Stabby.
[29:00.69]Is that donating his Australian records there, I guess?
[29:03.89]Yeah, so what you can do is when you go to our donation page at tipofthehats.org, you can donate either with money or with in-game TF2 items thanks to glnmarketplace.tf.
[29:15.74]It's very simple.
[29:17.46]One of the main things you can donate are unusual hats as well as the golden weapons and Stabby right there with a $77 value.
[29:26.08]Continuing to get it done despite not having those weapons anymore, but thank you for the donation.
[29:31.29]Thank you very much, Stabby.
[29:34.07]We got the point back.
[29:35.66]We did, and we might win.
[29:37.88]Through some miraculous way, and I exploded.
[29:41.29]Hold on.
[29:42.13]For the last second, I'm going to go scout and just sprint out there.
[29:45.05]That's the best strat.
[29:48.62]I think we're going to win here.
[29:49.70]We're going to win.
[29:50.78]I can feel it.
[29:51.92]I died.
[29:52.86]They're getting on the point.
[29:54.38]That's a problem.
[29:55.83]You have to do something right now.
[29:57.27]I'm dead.
[29:58.19]I've got to do something right now.
[29:59.11]You go.
[29:59.87]I've got to go.
[30:01.11]Godspeed.
[30:01.92]I've been practicing my double jump.
[30:04.76]See, one-two.
[30:06.08]We got Matess64 blocking the point.
[30:08.37]I believe in him.
[30:09.61]The 64th of the Matess clan.
[30:17.56]I think that's gonna be it.
[30:19.58]We win.
[30:20.60]Oh, we did it.
[30:21.86]We did it.
[30:23.51]I got 16 points.
[30:26.63]I'm at the top of my game.
[30:29.41]Dang.
[30:32.26]How do we talk with this?
[30:34.26]Uh...
[30:36.25]There we go.
[30:38.48]There we go.
[30:39.64]Also, guys, remember, keep in mind that this is all for One Step Camp.
[30:45.19]So all of your donations go to the wonderful cause.
[30:50.20]Please keep the donations rolling.
[30:53.97]Well, we're about to roll right now.
[30:56.78]Not yet, not yet.
[30:58.04]Not yet.
[30:58.52]I'm currently getting annihilated by a scout who air-shot me with a Sandman and then shoved a Force of Nature into my heart.
[31:08.99]And remember, every donation counts.
[31:10.37]I know we've been talking about big numbers and all that stuff, but even if you give a dollar, two dollars, it don't feel like, oh, it's not enough.
[31:19.54]Every little bit counts.
[31:20.84]So that's definitely something to keep in mind.
[31:23.59]Yeah, absolutely.
[31:24.25]Do you reckon we could get tagged to eat a banana right off the top of my box?
[31:27.89]Oh, I don't know about that.
[31:29.59]I think we could.
[31:31.60]I think we could.
[31:33.82]Is this for the kids, Sideshow?
[31:35.70]Yeah, yeah, this is for the kids.
[31:37.66]That's something I don't think would be... What's the term?
[31:40.63]Safe for work?
[31:41.81]Safe for work?
[31:43.17]I don't know.
[31:43.82]I think... I think it would be.
[31:48.36]I'm just going to... What, are you going to just slide it into his mouth?
[31:51.85]That's not going to work.
[31:53.25]You can't even see.
[31:55.07]I'm just going to...
[31:56.80]Live peeling of the box banana on stream, ladies and gentlemen.
[32:00.94]Who's going to tag?
[32:03.91]Tip of the banana.
[32:05.37]You want a banana?
[32:06.37]Tip of the banana.
[32:07.37]You want a banana?
[32:08.47]I'll take off the little brown bit at the end.
[32:12.06]Nobody likes these bits.
[32:13.82]I was saying we should bruise one up.
[32:15.98]There we go.
[32:16.99]You want that?
[32:19.17]Here, I'll eat this bit.
[32:22.46]$10 from Storm Hornet says, I tip my hat to all the wonderful people helping out and donating to this amazing event.
[32:30.01]You know, as Jerma mentioned, there is no small donation.
[32:33.22]Every donation counts, and every donation does go to Children's Oncology Services and the One Step Camp here in Chicago, which sends children who are dealing with the struggle of childhood cancer, it sends them to camp where they can build memories, build friendships, build friendships.
[32:48.26]a community and just be a kid again.
[32:51.37]So we want to thank all of you guys.
[32:52.85]We together, but mostly you guys, have already raised 106, over $106,000.
[32:58.44]So thank you very much for everyone at home.
[33:02.26]Keep them coming.
[33:03.08]Let's try to get to 110 by the end of the night.
[33:05.35]And of course, we are going for a few more hours.
[33:07.45]We're going to 11 CST.
[33:10.35]We are.
[33:10.61]We still got more left.
[33:12.44]We're not done.
[33:13.38]Not even close.
[33:14.40]We're not done yet.
[33:15.38]We still got a whole other day.
[33:17.61]How did I get all the way back here without being seen?
[33:19.55]Where are you?
[33:19.87]I don't know.
[33:20.63]You're on spy.
[33:21.29]I'm playing spy right now.
[33:22.75]Okay.
[33:23.65]Okay.
[33:24.32]We're gonna get a couple of dudes.
[33:26.96]I'm gonna... Hopefully.
[33:28.38]Hopefully we're gonna get a couple of dudes.
[33:29.84]It might not work out.
[33:33.14]I'm just gonna die to Mr. Slyn, who's doing his darndest to kill me, even though I'm in control over the box.
[33:39.45]I hope you feel good about that kill, Slyn.
[33:41.03]Oh, what?
[33:41.59]That was a really well-deserved and skillful kill there onto an opponent who's just as well set up as you are.
[33:48.14]Yep, well done.
[33:49.28]Are those shirts still on sale, too?
[33:52.22]The shirts?
[33:52.81]They are, yeah.
[33:53.37]The Teespring tip-of-the-hat shirts, you mean.
[33:55.51]Oh, yeah.
[33:56.13]Yeah, yeah.
[33:56.79]In fact, what's the status on the enamel pins as well?
[33:59.72]I wonder how many of them we've got left.
[34:01.96]We don't.
[34:02.42]We don't have any more of the pins left.
[34:03.57]Really?
[34:03.73]Oh, wow.
[34:03.91]No, they sold out.
[34:05.27]We do.
[34:06.26]Oh, right.
[34:06.72]Yeah, yeah.
[34:07.40]I don't know whether you were here, Bloodtie, but we got a second batch of those.
[34:10.41]Did we really?
[34:11.11]We really did.
[34:12.17]Wow.
[34:12.66]Another 150, I believe.
[34:14.12]My goodness.
[34:14.66]So maybe over at Prod, we can find out exactly how many we have left, because I don't know if you guys have seen this, and you can... 102?
[34:22.88]110 alright, so I've been told there's a hundred and ten pins left of course I am wearing one There's one on the table in front of me And if you guys go over to the tip of the hats Twitter you can see an excellent close-up picture as well They're very well made you guys it's a great opportunity to get those and show your support when you're not just gaming tag You don't want some fruit Have you had your five a day?
[34:49.09]Have you had one of your five in a day?
[34:52.29]You're lying.
[34:52.77]Oh boy, I'm already dead.
[34:55.78]That thing's going to turn gray real quick.
[34:58.98]Gray?
[34:59.32]That is going to be a gray banana in like two minutes.
[35:01.36]You ever eaten a gray banana?
[35:02.42]I've eaten plenty of gray bananas.
[35:04.53]Do they not normally turn brown?
[35:06.05]Have I been eating something else this whole time?
[35:07.99]They turn gray.
[35:09.19]Oh.
[35:09.65]They turn a dark gray.
[35:15.36]Things are going to drop onto your lap.
[35:18.03]Well, I could actually just peel it from the inside and eat it from this side, you know?
[35:25.32]I just have to retract my arm.
[35:28.06]Oh, my God.
[35:29.16]No, everybody knows.
[35:33.07]Everybody knows.
[35:33.57]Everybody knows it's me.
[35:34.23]Everybody knows.
[35:36.01]It's always getting out of the box.
[35:37.98]Can I help you here, sir, please?
[35:39.80]Don't worry.
[35:40.10]I've got this.
[35:40.52]Thank you.
[35:40.74]I don't want that to fall.
[35:42.26]That's valuable fruit that I don't want to hit the ground.
[35:46.11]You got it?
[35:46.90]I've got it.
[35:47.96]Now you gotta spin out the trash.
[35:53.28]Okay, and it fell.
[35:55.99]It fell straight down.
[35:57.57]$10 from Captain says, Sideshow, feet in arm holes.
[36:04.10]Is that even possible?
[36:05.94]It is.
[36:06.90]I've done it before.
[36:08.16]That's the horrible part.
[36:09.21]There's no way that's possible.
[36:11.63]I would guarantee that both legs aren't going out those holes.
[36:16.56]I could get both my legs in those holes.
[36:19.39]I'm telling you.
[36:19.87]Sounds like a challenge.
[36:22.09]Maybe we should put a donation match on it, but I could definitely get my feet in these armholes.
[36:28.82]I cannot imagine what that would look like.
[36:32.87]It would look the same as now, but... Where's your back going to be?
[36:36.71]Are you going to be like upside down?
[36:37.92]I wouldn't have my eyes looking here.
[36:41.50]I can't even picture it in my head.
[36:44.45]All I'm picturing is like...
[36:47.32]We're looking at like a box's butt.
[36:51.14]Oh, this is a good map.
[36:54.28]I like this map.
[36:56.93]Let me point this down here again.
[36:59.29]$100 from Stig from Resurfed says, too much choke feels bad, man.
[37:04.78]Thanks to Tip of the Hats team for this opportunity and this amazing event.
[37:09.22]Forehead, slim B, forehead.
[37:11.78]Those are emotes if you guys are keeping track at home.
[37:14.93]Those are emotes?
[37:15.95]Those are emotes.
[37:18.47]Is this a good spot?
[37:19.59]What have you done?
[37:21.87]Well, I put my arms through the arm holes, but my microphone has fallen down.
[37:26.14]So now I can't... Hold on.
[37:28.00]Let me get... I can... Oh, there we go.
[37:30.06]Let me help you.
[37:31.05]Let me help you here.
[37:31.85]Oh, that's going to stay.
[37:33.23]Okay, good.
[37:34.51]Where is it?
[37:35.23]Huh?
[37:35.63]No.
[37:35.87]I see the banana skin.
[37:37.37]The mic is here.
[37:38.02]Oh, oh, oh.
[37:38.84]Okay.
[37:39.32]I got it now.
[37:39.90]I see.
[37:40.66]I thought you meant it fell down.
[37:42.08]No, no, no.
[37:43.26]No, we got it.
[37:45.40]alright I'm going for a crazy strategy here I just uh had that classic TF2 crash that we all know and love well the uh the hl2.exe has stopped working I'm a bit I know that one hello there's something under my desk okay I thought there was like a rat in this room yeah for a second I was I was seriously about to be like what is running around here my peripheral vision is severely restricted that's not a a that's a reaction if there's a small animal in the room
[38:12.79]That's not like a, oh, there's somebody being funny.
[38:14.63]There's an animal under your feet.
[38:18.27]It was genuinely my concern.
[38:20.38]I actually got that guy.
[38:23.14]Alright, I'm going to spin it around this way.
[38:25.26]You know, sometimes you just want to kick back and relax.
[38:30.41]What's that robot's name from Borderlands?
[38:32.83]The little goofy one with the funny voice?
[38:35.41]Claptrap.
[38:36.05]Yeah, you pretty much have like a bad Claptrap costume on.
[38:39.55]The bad claptrap.
[38:41.41]Yeah.
[38:41.53]You even got through the square hole, too.
[38:42.76]I can go with that.
[38:44.22]I can market that.
[38:46.34]You know, I just realized that on the Camp Redmond main thing, there's a scout spilling a load of hats out of the box.
[38:54.09]I just died by my own sentry.
[38:57.14]Were we on my camera for that one?
[38:58.68]That's my box.
[38:59.26]Because I just died by my own sentry.
[39:01.50]That was fantastic.
[39:04.07]Why am I stuck?
[39:04.89]We're tough plays.
[39:06.11]Tough plays here, guys.
[39:07.63]Gemma, why am I stuck?
[39:09.34]can't move yeah what's happening are you like I think I think you're behind like the chair is like inside the box okay hold on don't like don't like careen over have I got it I think you got it okay I got it you don't got it but you got it he's got it he's alright he's gonna be fine don't worry he'll be alright
[39:34.63]We have a donation of $17.63 via the item donation.
[39:41.27]It's from GJW.
[39:42.61]Says, you guys are great.
[39:43.80]Y'all are so nice.
[39:45.02]Glad to see Jerma playing TF2 again.
[39:47.21]Smiley face.
[39:48.45]Thank you for all you do.
[39:49.95]and keep them donations coming let's get the scout voice actor on boys tip of the hats 2016. yes guys let's do that of course when you donate you can donate towards the next incentive that well not the next incentive but one of the many incentives we have which is to get the voice actor of the scout to play scout while in character you can see that selection over on the right hand side when you do go to the donate page at tipofthehats.org that is a great opportunity I'm actually very excited um to possibly have that happen
[40:19.94]I am a Scout Theseus myself.
[40:22.62]You know, I hate to be a D.Va.
[40:25.47]I know that you don't like being a D.Va either.
[40:27.27]I don't like being a D.Va.
[40:29.05]But could we get at least seven people kicked from this poke so that I can get back in?
[40:35.94]Would you like a coffee too?
[40:37.68]I'd love a coffee.
[40:38.74]There's not much left in here.
[40:39.72]There's actually nothing in there.
[40:42.10]That'll suit perfectly because there's no way I could have drunk that by pouring it into my eye.
[40:46.60]There was a little bit left.
[40:48.15]Oh, yeah, there is.
[40:49.91]That's a good job I didn't go full on with that one.
[40:51.31]Good job you didn't go full on with that, Jack, because you would have had coffee in your eye.
[40:56.67]Slideshow, did you eat the banana?
[40:58.53]I did, yeah.
[41:00.14]Yeah, it's not here anymore.
[41:01.18]Because we have $30 from Landmantis, who says, I can't think of a better reason to donate than getting to watch Jerma sit next to a box eating a banana.
[41:09.83]Well, there he is.
[41:11.17]The box ingested the banana.
[41:12.76]I can think of several, but okay.
[41:14.26]Thank you, Landmantis, for the $30.
[41:15.64]What happened to that scout?
[41:16.52]What happened to that scout?
[41:18.32]Honestly, I'm asking an honest question.
[41:20.57]He just phased out of time.
[41:21.81]Maybe he got disconnected.
[41:24.20]That's probably what happened.
[41:27.23]Every time I retry and I can't get in this server, I'd like another player to be kicked.
[41:32.98]Let's make it eight.
[41:35.46]Don't you do that to me.
[41:37.75]Nine.
[41:39.21]Let's kick nine people from this server.
[41:45.16]I'll just watch you instead, I think.
[41:46.44]Just watch me.
[41:46.92]Come over here.
[41:47.28]Hey, take this controller.
[41:48.28]Yeah, I'll just pretend that I'm big.
[41:49.87]This is the fake one.
[41:50.65]Don't get too close to me.
[41:52.25]This is like what you do with your little brother, you know?
[41:55.63]Get in here.
[41:56.22]Get in here.
[41:56.70]Come on.
[41:57.54]Get over here.
[41:58.28]You give him a controller that's not plugged in.
[42:01.32]They don't know that.
[42:01.94]They have no idea.
[42:04.41]You could be playing right now.
[42:05.93]See?
[42:06.43]He's playing.
[42:09.80]I feel like I'm at a bad Halloween party.
[42:14.03]I'm in like a crappy robot costume and you're in like a, hey, I'm a guy with a box on.
[42:19.36]Yeah, that's a classic.
[42:20.90]And we're like sitting in the corner.
[42:22.53]You know, I did actually go to a fancy dress party with a box on, actually.
[42:25.31]That was before the whole thing.
[42:26.67]I was dressed as a Christmas present.
[42:28.52]But it was like a... It was a full-length box.
[42:31.68]It was like a...
[42:34.03]Like it went all the way down to my knees, but I didn't think it through because there was no arm hold, so I just had to kind of stand with my arms by my side for the entire night, which meant I couldn't drink or dance or really be comfortable in any way.
[42:46.96]You know, it's really odd hearing you talk to me right here, but I hear you inside of my head.
[42:52.68]Something about this doesn't feel right.
[42:54.55]Yeah, when I talk, I hear voices in my head as well.
[42:56.61]Like, you are inside of my brain right now, but you're clearly speaking.
[43:00.01]I can't see your mouth moving, so it's even more strange.
[43:02.82]Yeah, it's just eyes.
[43:04.06]I'm just eyes and telepathically communicating to you.
[43:07.02]Somebody is dubbing over your voice while you're looking at me talking.
[43:10.33]That's what it sounds like.
[43:11.09]It's probably Getterwill.
[43:12.11]He does a pretty good impression.
[43:14.38]How many points do I have?
[43:15.44]We've never had a box like this before.
[43:17.52]Three.
[43:19.08]Three points.
[43:20.00]Three points.
[43:21.44]Wow.
[43:22.16]And I've got half of them because I'm helping you.
[43:25.75]You are?
[43:26.79]Yep.
[43:28.47]Three points.
[43:29.71]What is he doing?
[43:32.43]You took a piece of the core.
[43:33.79]You took a piece of the core.
[43:35.10]Oops.
[43:35.80]You're going down.
[43:40.28]I love you.
[43:41.04]Why are you Mr. Fruit Man right now?
[43:43.60]You were like eating all the fruits.
[43:45.47]I just hit the post.
[43:46.59]Desperately hungry.
[43:48.29]If I can hit somebody.
[43:49.51]If I can get the strength.
[43:50.71]I ate too many sweet things yesterday.
[43:52.09]Okay, sniper's not working.
[43:53.26]Do you reckon I could use two controllers?
[43:57.78]One hand is like analog.
[43:59.72]The other hand is like X, Y, A, B. Yeah, I think that would work.
[44:05.66]So what are we at right now for donations?
[44:10.51]We are at $106,750.
[44:13.37]And that is going to change because Homeless just donated $30,000 as well.
[44:18.18]But we have a donation from Nick Spie here.
[44:20.96]Hashtag tipofthehats2016.
[44:22.18]$10 says, Hey Jerma, could you tell us a bedtime story?
[44:26.97]Parentheses, maybe even the story of me old bones?
[44:31.07]I don't know.
[44:31.92]Everybody knows that story never gets told.
[44:34.48]That's the story.
[44:35.22]That's the story?
[44:35.92]That it never gets told?
[44:37.43]Yeah, the story is just, it's always supposed to be a story, and then nobody ever tells it.
[44:43.34]I think the captain that made up the story of the old bones just kind of didn't exist anymore.
[44:48.05]He started to talk about it, and I think the ship went under.
[44:50.89]That's it, like, he was telling his crew all the different things.
[44:54.57]As, oh, okay, people are just disappearing.
[44:56.85]I'm not crazy.
[44:57.91]I thought I was crazy at first, but I'm definitely not.
[45:00.56]People are just phasing out.
[45:03.14]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:04.32]They're disappearing.
[45:05.12]I just, uh, I'm writing their names down and they're getting kicked.
[45:09.47]I'm already in, but we need to remove a few more.
[45:11.63]You know when, uh, you know when, like, you're in a city with a high population density and it just gets annoying after a while?
[45:18.90]Sure.
[45:20.20]You're in a city with high popularity.
[45:22.24]I got an Uber.
[45:22.76]Hold on.
[45:23.08]Hold that thought.
[45:26.33]$25 from Funk.
[45:28.67]Says, bite me, Jill.
[45:31.32]That's pretty rude.
[45:33.18]Thank you, Funk.
[45:34.12]$25.
[45:35.74]Going to the one-step camp here in Chicago.
[45:40.13]Being dominated by Mr. Slim.
[45:45.36]You know, the...
[45:47.10]The original box disguise was pioneered by Gromit in Wallace and Gromit, The Curse of the Wrong Trousers.
[45:54.69]You know that?
[45:55.25]That's a fact.
[45:56.51]What?
[45:57.11]That's a fact.
[45:58.15]He sits there and he cuts a hole into it when he's watching the penguin escape.
[46:02.05]No, that was made in like the 30s.
[46:04.32]That was like a 1930s joke from the famous comedian.
[46:09.40]What's his name there?
[46:11.41]Wilford Brimley.
[46:12.63]No, no.
[46:13.59]He made a... No, no, no.
[46:15.39]What's his name?
[46:15.79]Uh...
[46:17.34]Abbott and Costello.
[46:18.74]No, that's two guys.
[46:19.96]Elvis Costello.
[46:20.90]Elvis Costello, yeah, the guitar player.
[46:22.83]Yeah, yeah, that was him.
[46:25.47]Yeah, the guy that was playing the guitar made up from the 30s.
[46:30.76]Because it gives better acoustics.
[46:32.17]That's why they use it for guitar playing.
[46:33.70]Yeah.
[46:35.05]The year 1930 has better acoustics.
[46:38.63]Yeah.
[46:39.07]Oh, wait, you're talking about in the box, being inside the box.
[46:41.27]Well, both, actually.
[46:42.01]1930 was renowned for its great acoustics because... I don't know why, actually.
[46:47.44]They never figured it out.
[46:50.16]I wonder what happened if you played a guitar in a box.
[46:52.42]Your guitar on you?
[46:54.56]Anybody have a guitar on them?
[46:57.23]Do you play?
[46:58.53]Yeah.
[46:59.97]Do you play well?
[47:01.41]Oh, yeah.
[47:03.61]How well?
[47:05.49]Real well.
[47:06.59]On a scale of one to well?
[47:09.41]On a scale of one to CTF well?
[47:13.40]Barn Blitz.
[47:14.16]Barn Blitz, yeah.
[47:15.98]That's pretty good.
[47:16.82]That's pretty bad, actually.
[47:18.16]Is it?
[47:20.51]Mm-hmm.
[47:20.67]Barn Blitz, yeah.
[47:21.03]I'm not a fan of Barn Blitz.
[47:22.79]You're not a fan of Barn Blitz?
[47:24.09]Why?
[47:24.91]It's got snow on it, and I'm getting critsed.
[47:26.39]It's... I'm not going to do anything with this.
[47:29.70]It's too snowy.
[47:30.44]Can't even get a scout.
[47:31.28]Can't even get a scout with 108.
[47:34.84]Indigo donates a $136 unusual.
[47:39.05]Says, this unusual cost me $400 when I traded my entire inventory for it.
[47:43.75]I don't play TF too much anymore, so I hope this hat goes to someone who needs it more.
[47:48.16]And of course, guys, you can do that.
[47:50.22]You can donate your unusuals that maybe you're not using anymore, and they will get liquidated right into cash, which goes right into the pocket of one-step cam.
[47:58.89]So if you guys have some items lying around, perhaps some high-value unusuals, send them over.
[48:04.46]We'll take them, and it'll go towards a great cause, helping kids get to camp.
[48:09.10]That's very true.
[48:10.56]Where are we at at the moment, Bloodside, with the old donations?
[48:13.21]What's the total?
[48:14.67]I can't see it over here.
[48:15.57]The total donation?
[48:16.39]106, I think so.
[48:17.55]106, 890.
[48:18.37]That's pretty impressive.
[48:20.30]Yeah, I think we can push for 110 by the end of the night.
[48:23.28]That would be fantastic.
[48:24.52]But it is up to you viewers at home.
[48:25.98]You've been so generous so far.
[48:27.68]Please continue to open up your hearts for us.
[48:32.77]That way you keep your money Yeah, it's what's quite safe that doesn't sound safe to me maybe safe from robbers, but it doesn't sound medically safe Well, I know we're wrong We're always made mail it mail it in this room.
[48:47.59]I Mean mala, I always get their name pronunciation.
[48:50.08]Uh, I don't mean mailer mailer has no medical quality.
[48:53.86]Are you sure I'm aware?
[48:56.14]I was thinking wait a minute.
[48:56.98]He's collapsed.
[48:57.96]Oh, yeah He can't help you
[49:03.64]I mean, he might try.
[49:05.10]He's a nice guy.
[49:07.95]One bite out of that apple.
[49:10.49]The Deadly Stog donates an item worth $16.85.
[49:14.03]Says, good to see Jerma having some fun with TF2 again.
[49:17.42]This is a great event that's going on and I'm glad I can donate.
[49:20.97]We are glad you could donate as well.
[49:22.43]Thank you very much.
[49:23.59]Oh boy, that was bad.
[49:24.35]Hopefully the camera was not on me.
[49:25.55]Hopefully the camera was not on me.
[49:26.65]Please tell me it wasn't on me.
[49:30.10]People are going to laugh at me.
[49:34.27]Alright, we got... Things are getting down to the crunch here.
[49:39.89]We've only got ten seconds left to defend this.
[49:41.51]They are.
[49:41.89]I need to step my game up is what I need to do.
[49:44.90]I'm not doing so well.
[49:45.86]We're gonna go with the bread and butter.
[49:48.82]I'm gonna go with Spy.
[49:50.18]Spy, Ambassador, and we're just gonna go for the shooting.
[49:53.16]Got a Sniper here.
[49:53.87]I feel like the advanced mechanics of a controller are exactly what I need.
[49:58.21]I actually can't believe you're doing as kind of well as you are using that thing.
[50:05.84]I got backstabbed by another spy.
[50:07.04]I was supposed to be the guy stabbing.
[50:08.58]I got backstabbed by a spy.
[50:10.93]It's the worst feeling in the world.
[50:12.43]Not even other spies.
[50:13.93]Did we win?
[50:15.11]Nope.
[50:15.63]I think we lost.
[50:16.47]Unless we recap.
[50:17.23]If we recap... There's five people.
[50:18.89]There's three people on it right now.
[50:20.85]We can do this.
[50:21.36]How do we keep doing these miracle wins?
[50:24.16]They just... I think they're rallying around you, you know?
[50:27.30]Alright, guys.
[50:27.72]Rally around me.
[50:29.48]Oh, double dunk.
[50:30.36]Hello.
[50:30.88]We're just going in.
[50:31.44]Just going to start freaking out.
[50:32.79]No, I'm dead.
[50:35.41]Okay, I saw that there's a bomb in the lasagna.
[50:38.67]I thought that was on the map.
[50:39.59]I was like, what?
[50:41.49]Because you mentioned that too.
[50:42.36]I was like, why is that on my screen right now?
[50:44.06]There's no bomb in the lasagna, you guys.
[50:45.50]Don't worry.
[50:46.52]The pastor is safe.
[50:48.78]There's a fly in my soup.
[50:53.21]I gotta get at least one kill here.
[50:55.01]Okay, I'm back.
[50:55.92]We're on the point.
[50:56.86]Just need to clear these guys out.
[50:58.20]Use the wrench.
[51:00.48]We lost.
[51:02.82]I didn't do very much.
[51:04.65]Well, guys, I think that's going to do it for our pub event here.
[51:08.71]But, I mean, if you guys want to get me, maybe, Jeremy, you can get up and walk around.
[51:12.54]Maybe we can have a sideshow in a box.
[51:14.08]Join me on the couch over here.
[51:16.04]Get on the couch over there.
[51:17.40]I could be kind of fun.
[51:18.61]I don't know if you can sit down at all.
[51:19.97]Non-branded cola.
[51:21.63]Jeremy, you can just do whatever you want because you have a GoPro.
[51:23.47]I think...
[51:27.70]Alright, you go first.
[51:29.24]This is going to be harder for you to go.
[51:30.63]There you go.
[51:34.63]While you guys make your way over here, we have a $50 donation from Andy Typo.
[51:39.56]He says, someone needs this more than I do.
[51:41.73]These can't come with me.
[51:42.41]Thank you very much.
[51:43.29]Of course, it will go to a great cause.
[51:46.03]And as we can see on screen here.
[51:47.96]Alright.
[51:49.52]A man in a box and a man with a camera stuck to his head.
[51:55.19]The adventure continues here on day two of Tip of the Hats 2016.
[51:58.98]Of course, keep those donations coming.
[52:01.36]We just crossed over the $107,000 threshold.
[52:06.87]Let's get it to 110, guys.
[52:08.97]As I can see, oh, hi.
[52:12.22]Here's a guy with a camera on his head and a Coke in his hand.
[52:20.17]So this is some sort of camera-ception.
[52:23.61]Oh, wow.
[52:23.79]These bones are tired.
[52:24.91]Oh, hi.
[52:28.56]Yeah, I'm going to scooch over this way.
[52:29.94]I don't know if you'll be able to sit down, actually.
[52:32.85]You might need to scoot on the very end.
[52:34.37]Yeah, there we go.
[52:37.51]So while I have you guys here, maybe you could tell me a little bit about that experience.
[52:42.34]I'm not sure we've ever had in the history of TF2 someone play in a box while eating a banana next to a man with a camera strapped to his head.
[52:50.56]Well, why don't you go first?
[52:52.48]Oh, wait.
[52:53.23]Do I have a mic on?
[52:54.67]OK.
[52:54.94]I've got no microphone.
[52:59.17]I'm sure there's one behind you or near you.
[53:00.80]Or you could just lean over and talk to Joel.
[53:03.52]Where'd it go?
[53:04.25]I feel like I have a mining helmet on.
[53:05.57]I can suck one into you.
[53:12.12]$100 from Clever Dan says absolutely nothing.
[53:16.23]There's nothing there.
[53:17.30]But he gave us $100.
[53:17.94]Thanks for the $100.
[53:18.86]Thank you, Clever Dan.
[53:19.90]Yeah, I think this is a new experience.
[53:24.19]Everybody lined up back there.
[53:26.42]Hi.
[53:26.88]Hello.
[53:28.86]Suddenly a new experience for everyone involved.
[53:31.16]Yeah, this is a new experience.
[53:33.29]I've never even worn a GoPro in my life.
[53:36.05]This is the first time I've ever had one on, and I'm just sitting over there.
[53:38.85]I don't even know what you could even see when I was playing, but hopefully it was entertaining.
[53:43.50]It could have gone either way.
[53:45.97]Yeah, I couldn't see a thing, so I can't offer any kind of perspective on that.
[53:52.79]Holding the mic in your, like, hole.
[53:55.20]Yeah, I mean, it doesn't go much further than that.
[53:58.40]You know, just don't even take it off.
[53:59.36]Just keep the thing on the whole time.
[54:01.11]Keep your what on?
[54:01.89]Don't ever take the box off.
[54:03.07]Even when you go to the bathroom, leave it on.
[54:06.14]So would you say that the box helped your gaming abilities or maybe did not help your gaming abilities?
[54:12.61]I'd say this is probably how humans were designed to play video games.
[54:17.55]It keeps you warm.
[54:18.99]It keeps all of the sound inside.
[54:23.90]If you're worried about waking up your parents at night, you can just game as much as you want inside one of these things.
[54:30.54]You just scream like there's no way they're going to hear you.
[54:34.51]So what else?
[54:36.39]I mean, you've got everything you need.
[54:38.13]You've got arm holes.
[54:38.98]You've got eye holes.
[54:39.90]Room for food.
[54:40.92]Room for food, yeah.
[54:41.86]I mean, I had a lot of fruit in here at some point.
[54:44.11]So there's the snack shelves.
[54:47.57]It looked like you were just talking to the Balloonicon.
[54:50.48]It looked like you were telling all that to the Balloonicon.
[54:53.17]The Balloonicorn at some times seems more receptive than Bloodsire, you know?
[54:57.88]What did I do to you?
[54:59.38]He just asked you the question.
[55:01.21]Look at the caring eyes of the Balloonicorn.
[55:02.77]Hey, you know what?
[55:04.15]Good game.
[55:04.61]Good game.
[55:06.50]Jeremy, how about you?
[55:07.16]What was it like playing with a third eye?
[55:09.83]Well, I couldn't see what the eye was seeing.
[55:11.57]Well, now you can.
[55:12.45]Well, now I can.
[55:13.79]I guess it was, I apparently had it down too low, like this.
[55:17.32]At one point.
[55:17.98]At one point, yeah, you kind of corrected me.
[55:20.53]It was like, hey, just like a guy sitting down at that point.
[55:23.85]Not even a guy playing a game.
[55:25.72]It was different.
[55:26.30]It was fun.
[55:27.34]Would I ever do it again?
[55:28.22]Of course I would.
[55:31.92]Well, now that I have you guys sitting on the couch, we have a $100 donation from Couchsitter.
[55:36.78]It says, always a great time running into Tip of the Hat.
[55:39.43]Here's a Benjamin for the kids.
[55:42.36]I don't know what that means, but thank you.
[55:44.62]I don't know what a Benjamin is because I'm not used to American money.
[55:47.85]That's Benjamin Franklin.
[55:49.29]Benjamin Franklin's on the 100.
[55:50.65]Oh, he's on the 100.
[55:51.43]Oh, yeah, Benjamin Franklin.
[55:52.45]Do you know who Benjamin Franklin was?
[55:54.33]I know who Benjamin Franklin is.
[55:55.55]Who was he?
[55:56.11]Yeah, yeah.
[55:56.69]What did he do?
[55:57.77]He's some... I don't need to tell you who Benjamin Franklin is.
[56:02.40]Some American guy who has no significance to you.
[56:04.74]Benjamin Franklin invented and discovered electricity.
[56:08.38]Yeah, yeah.
[56:09.11]He's the father of all electricity.
[56:10.47]He made it up.
[56:11.23]Before him, electricity didn't exist, right?
[56:13.67]Yeah, he made it up.
[56:14.61]He created it in a pot in his bedroom.
[56:17.48]yeah I put in like some spice leaves and is that the one who uh sailed electricity up on a kite and like he sailed electricity over the seven seas and he made his way into uh into America that's how America was founded here on tip of the hats we're an educational stream as well so there you go if you didn't know who uh who Benjamin Franklin was well uh now you know now you know who he is didn't help at all
[56:43.15]That didn't help at all.
[56:44.77]I have no idea who he was.
[56:46.95]Hey, guys, we just had quite a large donation come in.
[56:49.83]I just saw that.
[56:50.47]Yeah, I mean, we're up to 107,332, so we might even reach 110,000 by the end.
[56:56.54]Well, maybe not the end of this segment, but the challenge is open to you guys at home.
[57:00.14]Keep them coming.
[57:00.81]One day, too.
[57:01.49]That's really, really impressive.
[57:03.25]Yeah, well, we're on day two here.
[57:05.51]Oh, well, I mean, like.
[57:06.33]Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
[57:07.77]And, of course, if you guys want to get in, maybe you want something for your money other than satisfaction, we have great items that you can get.
[57:15.20]Not only when you donate will you receive in-game items such as a medal, depending on how much you do donate, but we do have the Teespring campaign going on.
[57:25.20]You can scroll on the bottom of the stream.
[57:27.60]You can get in on that.
[57:28.60]I believe they're $25.
[57:29.69]And I was told, Sideshow, you corrected me, but we have a new shipment of pins.
[57:34.01]You are wearing one yourself right there on the box.
[57:36.55]These pins?
[57:37.66]These guys?
[57:38.16]Yeah, it looks... There we go.
[57:40.90]This box actually just came with it.
[57:43.68]You know, this was the box that the pins were delivered in.
[57:48.15]And there was only one pin in this box.
[57:51.43]So that's why we were able to chop it up.
[57:53.51]But we do have more, correct?
[57:55.75]This one just, you know, was sent here, but only one pin.
[57:59.32]I don't know what they were doing there.
[58:00.90]But it doesn't matter because there's another load that you guys can get.
[58:04.97]That's awesome.
[58:05.99]These are really cool pins.
[58:08.20]I much like them, very much.
[58:12.20]What's up next?
[58:13.40]What's going on after this?
[58:14.72]I believe we have a random hour coming up.
[58:19.03]It is, yeah, I will tell you.
[58:21.29]It's the Jackbox Party Pack, isn't it?
[58:23.19]Oh, that's right.
[58:23.71]That's what it is.
[58:24.47]It is the Jackbox Party Pack.
[58:26.95]Ghetto L will be sitting here, and we are going to have...
[58:30.22]slim, admirable, and I believe, Jeremy, you will be seated at the couch once again.
[58:34.30]Hey, I'll be here.
[58:34.74]I'll be here.
[58:35.28]I'll be here giving support.
[58:36.40]I'll be here maybe participating in the festivities.
[58:39.59]Of course, that $180 donation did just come in with its message.
[58:44.67]It's from Sunk Funk, by the way.
[58:46.71]It says, I'm donating $180 for the 1,800 hours I've put in since 2010 on PC, Xbox 360.
[58:53.70]Doesn't count.
[58:54.72]Shout out to the Scoreshot users out there.
[58:57.76]Hootah.
[58:58.62]Hootah.
[58:59.42]Hootah.
[58:59.68]Hootah.
[59:00.20]Now, something I just saw down at the bottom there, you see this?
[59:04.21]See this thing here?
[59:06.04]It was the Pyro Hero.
[59:07.90]Did you get an opportunity to explain what that was while we were rabbiting on, Bloodsire?
[59:12.41]No, I haven't.
[59:13.53]Maybe you can.
[59:14.19]Yeah, because I had a talk with him.
[59:18.67]You got so close to his eyes.
[59:21.27]I had to talk with him behind the scenes, you know?
[59:23.11]See what I'm talking about?
[59:23.87]Doesn't it seem like somebody's dubbing over his voice?
[59:26.74]Somebody's dubbing him over.
[59:27.88]He's not even talking in here.
[59:29.12]Sounds like somebody's just dubbing him over.
[59:31.12]And what it is is Lang's perfected the art of playing Pyro with a Guitar Hero controller.
[59:39.03]And so that's what he's going to do.
[59:40.74]He's going to show you that Pyro is a class so skilled it can only be perfected through the art of rock.
[59:49.18]That's Lang nodding.
[59:52.70]So that is what that one was.
[59:53.72]Because I saw that people, I think, you know, it's got a bit of an ambiguous title.
[59:58.39]It's a bit vague, so it needed some clarification.
[60:01.63]Because that one, you've got to see that.
[60:03.74]Because Lang is a rock god.
[60:07.50]And his pyro skills are also unmatchable.
[60:09.99]So when you combine the two, you get something real special.
[60:16.26]So you play with the Guitar Hero controller.
[60:18.71]Yeah, I assume like the, you know, the... Like the five buttons?
[60:24.76]And then you probably like fire with the... I got to see that.
[60:30.77]That's crazy.
[60:31.67]That's something I've never thought I would ever see, is a guy playing with a Guitar Hero controller.
[60:36.02]Well, we are almost at 108.
