[00:27.03]What is up?
[00:29.17]What's up?
[00:36.39]2 p.m.
[00:38.37]Early.
[00:38.99]What?
[00:42.98]Two minutes early?
[00:43.74]Get out of here.
[00:45.50]Shut up.
[00:47.62]Is Chrono Trigger going to be tonight?
[00:52.58]Maybe.
[00:54.78]No.
[00:55.04]Alright.
[00:55.28]Here's the promise.
[00:56.26]Are you ready?
[01:00.91]Here, let me make a fake pretend promise.
[01:06.06]At two hours and 30 minutes in the mummy game, two hours and 30 minutes, we will hold a meeting
[01:22.90]right now, we'll hold a meeting in two hours and 30 minutes, where I will dictate to all of you what the plan is.
[01:31.10]Okay?
[01:42.00]Yeah, none of you have any say in this at all.
[01:46.63]It's just that two hours and thirty minutes, I'm going to take a little bit of an assessment, we'll have a little bit of a meeting about it, and I will dictate what it's going to be.
[02:03.19]I just went down the wrong pipe.
[02:04.33]Who cursed me?
[02:05.19]Who told me?
[02:05.65]Who did that?
[02:16.02]Yeah, we're going to play the Curse the Eye of Isis.
[02:19.42]The mummy game.
[02:20.20]It was very fun.
[02:21.10]I was having a good time.
[02:22.22]We were just kind of chilling, having some fun.
[02:24.66]Then we're going to move on, maybe, to Chrono Trigger.
[02:32.25]I've got probably one or two sessions left in Chrono Trigger.
[02:35.31]We'll see.
[02:35.91]I don't know.
[02:38.55]Chat's moving so fast, he'll never know.
[02:41.87]Chat's not moving that fast.
[02:45.78]You guys can do better than this.
[02:48.64]This chat is moving so fast.
[02:50.28]You guys can do fucking better than this.
[02:51.62]Are you serious?
[02:53.28]This is not fast.
[03:00.19]There, I can now it's fast.
[03:03.03]Don't tell me the chat's fast when it's not.
[03:06.37]How can I trust anything you ever say?
[03:11.51]Alright, now slow the chat down.
[03:12.57]I don't want to see that shit.
[03:13.53]Slow it down.
[03:14.23]Too fast.
[03:19.90]Alright.
[03:20.14]We're going to get the ads out of the way.
[03:21.60]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[03:23.76]They should start.
[03:24.46]I'm going to sit here and make sure they do.
[03:25.60]Yeah, slow it down.
[03:39.00]Auto owns you.
[03:41.04]That's fine.
[03:42.84]I love my dog.
[03:51.81]Alright.
[03:52.15]Ads should start.
[03:53.03]Let's see if they do.
[03:57.73]Will they start?
[03:59.97]It's always the mystery in the beginning of these streams.
[04:08.23]Hmm.
[04:11.21]Can we elect auto instead of you?
[04:14.73]There's no election here.
[04:16.09]This is me.
[04:25.52]Why are you the entire solar system?
[04:28.78]Uh, it's called egomania.
[04:42.19]I thought this was an autocris- an autocris- an autocracy.
[04:50.39]We should get an autoplanet.
[04:55.03]I don't even know why it was a solar system.
[04:57.97]Have we ever talked about it?
[05:00.35]It's because I took a shitty picture of Blizzcon of my face and I just posted it.
[05:04.29]I think it was on Twitter at the time.
[05:07.57]I just was like, oh, I guess I'm just going to use this for a bunch of stuff.
[05:11.47]This is one of the emotes that had just, I don't think even emotes were a big deal at the time.
[05:22.04]This is like what, 2013, 2014?
[05:25.69]There's lore here.
[05:46.16]I think I, okay.
[05:47.76]The thing about what we, what we found out last night, yesterday afternoon.
[05:53.40]There are a whole swaths of my entire online kind of content creator life by ads just started.
[06:00.13]Alright.
[06:04.53]I was going to say, there are a whole swaths of me streaming for all this time that I just genuinely don't even remember.
[06:11.96]The hard drive got written over as of like seven years ago.
[06:15.16]Alright, here we go.
[08:31.66]About 30 seconds.
[08:32.34]Oh, I forgot to put the thing on.
[08:37.17]Samuel Tarly, I order you not to die.
[08:40.41]I don't get those YouTube shorts about Game of Thrones anymore.
[08:47.24]Samuel Tarly, I order you not to die.
[08:59.06]Oh, I also want to welcome back everybody.
[09:01.26]I want to correct the record on something I said last night.
[09:04.44]I mentioned a few things about how the married with children intro that when I was younger, I thought they were saying love and carrots.
[09:12.99]It was actually love and merits.
[09:14.13]I thought they were saying merits.
[09:16.41]I didn't like really understand what the word marriage was.
[09:18.47]But then they say horse and carriage.
[09:21.27]And I thought they were saying horse and carrots.
[09:24.09]So I just want to correct that record.
[09:36.19]there we go alright let's go we were oh that's right I I got stuck in a coffin I got stuck in a coffin that's all I remember
[10:07.41]I do have a key.
[10:08.11]And I think the key is to this desk.
[10:14.26]This is Victoria's desk.
[10:15.42]I don't think I opened this.
[10:20.20]Let's go.
[10:24.01]Papers?
[10:24.33]This is just lore shit.
[10:28.33]Do I really want to read Victoria's handwritten notes?
[10:34.28]Is this the Dracula game from last night?
[10:35.89]I fell asleep two hours... I thought you said two hours ago.
[10:38.69]Alright, let's read them.
[10:46.98]Wednesday evening and the opening of the exhibition is almost upon me.
[10:50.12]Mother would be so proud.
[10:51.19]I wish you could have been here to witness this moment.
[10:53.87]My life's work to bring to the nation the artifacts of Seath's tomb together and in public for the first time in decades.
[11:03.00]And yet I cannot shake the events of the past few days.
[11:07.80]The letter that arrived in my name from Dr. Waheed still puzzles me.
[11:12.60]He has not, to my knowledge, attempted to contact me by other means.
[11:15.37]Okay, this is now a couple hours later.
[11:20.23]It's Set.
[11:22.43]Seath?
[11:23.13]Seth.
[11:23.97]Set.
[11:25.43]Not Seath the Scaleless.
[11:29.04]Set.
[11:31.30]How could I have forgot?
[11:32.88]How could I have forgotten?
[11:33.62]Set!
[11:34.50]Set!
[11:40.99]The police appear to be taking something seriously, though.
[11:43.31]I was stopped at least four times during the course of my work this evening by the museum staff who know precisely who I am.
[11:53.47]Victor Kemble, in particular, seemed apologetic but gave me the impression he was only acting under orders.
[11:59.78]Myth or not, there's no stopping a good bedtime story from making people jumpy.
[12:03.10]I only hope it does not reflect badly on the exhibition.
[12:07.05]An hour later.
[12:07.59]Mr. Campbell has just been around again to tell me the police are arriving in greater numbers.
[12:12.65]It's too noisy around here, particularly for a library.
[12:15.51]How one's meant to get any work done, I don't know.
[12:17.54]A ridiculous situation.
[12:19.00]Maybe things would be quieter in the new exhibition.
[12:20.98]I wonder what the police are.
[12:23.24]Oh no.
[12:26.02]What happened?
[12:31.17]What happened?
[12:31.67]Alright, remember the clock?
[12:36.29]8.26 p.m.
[12:36.81]and then there was a note.
[12:37.77]I want you guys to remember this because I'm not going to.
[12:40.85]Where is it?
[12:43.83]Yeah.
[12:44.63]13 left, 2 right, 6 right.
[12:46.75]Remember that.
[12:52.30]Okay.
[12:52.60]I got stuck in a coffin somewhere.
[12:54.54]Anybody remember where that was?
[12:57.60]It's been a day.
[12:58.08]I don't remember.
[12:58.50]Okay.
[13:02.48]Here's the west wing key.
[13:05.93]I think I have to go back to the atrium.
[13:11.14]It was after the mummies.
[13:12.02]Yeah, we got a new... Was it upstairs?
[13:19.80]This game is sick.
[13:20.58]Those of you that don't know... According to a live streamer... That I follow... They said... They said this last night, which is interesting.
[13:31.87]They said that this is the... This is scarier than Resident Evil.
[13:36.25]Which I find very interesting.
[13:47.86]Nothing.
[13:48.22]Am I going the right way?
[13:49.82]Is this correct?
[13:54.32]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:54.96]What just happened?
[13:58.81]I was trying to figure this out last night.
[14:00.03]Huh?
[14:14.76]Should I go down that?
[14:15.76]I forget where I'm going.
[14:18.90]Wait, combination.
[14:22.30]13 left, 6 right, 2 right.
[14:25.47]Dude, you're getting literal chills right now.
[14:30.63]I know, me too.
[14:34.88]Oh, hey, Abdul.
[14:35.76]I just literally walked in a full circle.
[14:37.66]Good to see you.
[14:47.34]So where is it?
[14:53.43]I think I do have to go back to the atrium.
[14:54.77]Because it's the west wing.
[14:55.75]I have the west wing key.
[14:56.77]And I think that's what it was.
[14:57.57]I think it's on ground floor.
[14:59.31]I don't know that you also watch Jermo.
[15:02.56]What's your favorite bit from him?
[15:04.80]Um.
[15:09.50]I actually don't follow Jermo anymore.
[15:15.32]He's funny for a while, but, um, I think for, at some point, I think he, like, he said he was retired a couple years ago, which I completely understand, because at some point, like, I, I heard him, there's, like, this cat puke thing, and he did it so many times in a row that it's just, like, it was funny the first few times, but he kind of has a tendency to do that.
[15:35.11]But he kind of just, like, says the same joke, like, fucking over, like, 10 years.
[15:39.47]Um, I thought he's funny.
[15:40.59]Like, he's alright.
[15:41.19]It's, like, I think there's better streamers, though.
[15:49.31]I think this is it here.
[15:56.15]He fell off so bad.
[16:00.39]No he didn't.
[16:01.07]No he didn't.
[16:02.72]He's doing just fine everybody.
[16:06.10]Better than ever actually.
[16:07.06]I think it's here.
[16:16.02]No, no, I, you know, he told me himself.
[16:17.74]I know him very well.
[16:19.44]He told me he's doing just fine, okay?
[16:25.23]Is it?
[16:33.83]Alright, remind me, do not go into the coffin.
[16:37.34]My dad works at Jerma's.
[16:40.32]Oh, that's cool.
[16:40.80]Do you have any, like, any tips or anything about, like, what's coming out soon or whatever?
[16:48.75]Because I heard, according to an earnings call for the Derma95, the last earnings call, I think they said, hey, I don't give a fuck anymore and I'm just kind of doing whatever.
[17:01.44]And that scared the shit out of all the investors because like, what the fuck is it?
[17:04.76]What do you mean?
[17:05.42]I don't give a fuck.
[17:06.06]I'm just going to do anything I want.
[17:08.58]Like, that's kind of terrifying to hear.
[17:14.59]Like, when the CEO of the company starts saying, I don't care, like, fuck it, I'm just doing any... I thought it was me again.
[17:19.23]He keeps calling this a... He keeps calling it a broadcast arc.
[17:27.20]I don't know what that means.
[17:30.92]Um, and, well, it just means that I'm... Well, it means that... Well, if you were listening to the... If you listened to the fucking call, which you didn't, obviously...
[17:50.15]Somebody said, can you please just have fun again?
[17:51.81]This is me having fun.
[18:01.92]The extroverted introvert slogan for the company was a little weird.
[18:04.82]Yeah.
[18:20.93]Alright, this is it.
[18:22.21]I don't want to lose here.
[18:22.97]I don't want to die here because this is actually it.
[18:27.07]I don't... Remind me, do not go into the coffins, please.
[18:29.57]When are you going to get the Alvin and the Chipmunks tattoo?
[18:35.55]What the fuck are you talking about?
[18:59.43]Is this the right way?
[18:59.95]Is this to the library?
[19:03.67]No, wait a minute.
[19:06.41]Where is it?
[19:10.20]Oh, shit.
[19:10.64]Right, I remember this.
[19:11.24]I think I'm close.
[19:21.28]Don't go in the coffin.
[19:22.90]I thought it was up and then around.
[19:24.22]Do I not have... What the hell was that?
[19:28.68]That was a weird noise.
[19:34.77]This way?
[19:35.09]The hell is this weird room?
[19:41.83]The room before a room?
[19:43.07]Did I do this yesterday and just forget it?
[19:44.39]I think so.
[19:48.27]I think I was doing a thing where I was just talking and just walking.
[19:51.24]I was walking aimlessly.
[19:54.50]Yeah, I definitely was.
[19:55.24]Let me look at the map.
[20:02.64]Alright, there's a door behind me that I have not gone in.
[20:05.52]Let's just try that one.
[20:08.72]I love persistent maps like that that actually show a locked door.
[20:11.72]This is not open.
[20:22.43]What do you do in your house every day because it's a mansion?
[20:26.99]I run as fast as I can and I slide down my bowling alley.
[20:31.98]Like, we get greased up, and I slide down it, and I just re- I reenact every 90s comedy movie routine.
[20:39.12]With the ball in my hand, and I go, oh my god!
[20:42.11]And I get a strike.
[20:43.95]Um, and Holly just, like, shakes her head.
[20:45.65]She's like, what the?
[20:47.67]I do this- I do it every single day.
[20:54.61]Yep, I remember this.
[21:01.00]I record it every time, too, because I think it's funny.
[21:03.02]What if I get a really funny one?
[21:05.18]And I've recorded it probably six or seven hundred times at this point.
[21:12.75]It's always been sort of, like, kind of... It's been kind of funny.
[21:17.41]Not really.
[21:21.31]One of these days I'll get a good one, though.
[21:25.38]Just really trying to capture that essence and... Alright, hold on.
[21:31.73]I've already been up here.
[21:32.45]Yep, this is where the goons are.
[21:35.98]How did I...
[21:40.20]Where do I go?
[21:41.12]I, I, I was, I was doing this, okay, I gotta, okay, stop with the fucking routine I'm doing.
[21:45.64]I did the same exact thing last night, and accidentally made game progress.
[21:51.25]So, I'm gonna pay attention for a few minutes.
[21:53.59]We need to find the right way.
[21:55.91]If you weren't here yesterday, we got to a place where I got softlocked, not my fault at all, don't let anybody, go watch it, you'll see, the game just fucked up.
[22:03.66]Actually, not a joke, it really did.
[22:13.85]Alright, which door?
[22:17.83]This one?
[22:18.23]No, this is the funny one.
[22:20.99]No.
[22:26.08]We got an introduction to a new enemy type.
[22:27.98]Let me look at the map again.
[22:29.84]This way maybe?
[22:32.78]I don't remember.
[22:35.88]This is locked.
[22:41.13]This is where I came in.
[22:42.55]Is it down?
[22:46.17]No, because this just goes back to the very beginning of the game.
[22:48.67]Right?
[22:52.73]Shit.
[22:56.77]How much progress did I actually lose yesterday?
[22:58.73]Because it was kind of a lot.
[23:00.37]Maybe is there something that I didn't do first?
[23:07.35]We did the torture room.
[23:08.51]I remember that.
[23:09.09]Then we... I don't... It's just... I feel like I lost like 30 minutes progress.
[23:16.16]This game is really fun though.
[23:17.36]Like if you weren't here last night, just wait till we get back to the correct progress route.
[23:21.16]It's been fun.
[23:25.14]I just don't remember the exact way we go.
[23:34.52]I remember getting to this room with a statue.
[23:39.00]You slice that guy's head off.
[23:40.00]Yeah, I remember, I remember this.
[23:43.05]I remember going down here.
[23:46.34]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[23:49.62]Got it.
[23:58.07]Progress.
[23:58.93]Pog.
[23:59.57]Pog!
[24:05.31]Oh shit.
[24:11.56]Definitely need to use the gun.
[24:13.95]I've not even healed one time the whole playthrough.
[24:15.77]I said that yesterday, but it's true.
[24:16.79]Alright, here we go.
[24:20.34]Yep, this is it for sure.
[24:21.42]Let's go.
[24:23.04]Get out the gun.
[24:24.96]Yep.
[24:29.68]Oh, you scared now?
[24:42.00]Load it up.
[24:51.18]Remember, don't go in the coffin.
[25:01.73]Go in the coffin?
[25:06.69]Luigi's Mansion?
[25:09.39]I tell you, I played Luigi's Mansion 3 for one hour and I had to stop.
[25:14.14]Because I was sucking up every single item in the room and it took me like an hour to get through the tutorial area.
[25:20.52]I cannot play that game.
[25:22.28]Every room needs to be completely cleaned.
[25:25.60]Yep.
[25:26.04]Elevator.
[25:26.56]That's right.
[25:28.22]Hold on a second.
[25:28.75]I'm not going to do this yet.
[25:30.97]Let me check the other rooms.
[25:31.87]There's like two other rooms I didn't try to go in.
[25:33.43]Okay.
[25:42.96]This is locked.
[25:50.80]You did Super Mario Sunshine and Chibi-Robo just fine, believe in yourself.
[25:56.66]It was different though.
[25:58.66]It was different.
[25:59.34]Uh-oh.
[26:05.64]What a fun game Chibi-Robo really was.
[26:09.04]What the fuck?
[26:14.04]Oh, I can't go into the gash.
[26:16.96]Can I?
[26:17.20]Yeah, I can.
[26:19.00]What?
[26:21.29]Why have I thought that was gonna instantly kill me the entire time I've been playing?
[26:24.31]You can just walk right through.
[26:25.26]Just hold your breath for one second.
[26:34.44]I was so scared of that the whole game.
[26:35.96]Okay, so eventually then we need power to the elevator.
[26:44.97]This doesn't do anything.
[26:45.75]Alright, so I know where I'm going.
[26:50.21]Oh!
[26:53.96]What was that?
[26:55.62]Was that something right here?
[27:00.54]Actually, what the fuck man?
[27:01.46]That was real.
[27:02.02]That actually was scary.
[27:03.57]I just fucked up my whole brain.
[27:12.11]Why the fuck?
[27:12.73]That was the only scare that really was real.
[27:24.31]Stop shooting this guy!
[27:25.41]He's got infinite health!
[27:27.41]Oh my god, that was awful!
[27:28.98]I knew somebody was down here too!
[27:36.26]That sucked!
[27:37.16]I... I knew it!
[27:40.96]I'm annoyed at myself for knowing that and just... I think I just stopped paying attention for a second.
[27:44.80]Okay.
[27:53.17]Alright, this is where... I know, this is where I'm going.
[28:02.54]It's because that wasn't there yesterday and... I need a fucking bush light.
[28:22.38]Let's go in the elevator and get this over with.
[28:33.93]Did you suggest that you... pretend to get scared?
[28:38.69]No, I just like... sometimes they just do it really badly.
[28:41.07]Sometimes it's just... I'm not expecting it.
[28:48.51]You need a mishal... a mishalite owl.
[28:54.17]Nicolobe?
[28:54.77]You mean Nicolobe Light?
[29:01.77]Nah, sorry.
[29:03.20]This is a bush household.
[29:04.86]Bush Light household.
[29:05.68]Let me get the gun.
[29:09.90]Here comes the scary part.
[29:24.34]Ah!
[29:25.22]Ah!
[29:25.34]How about a twisted T?
[29:36.06]No.
[29:43.36]Hey, you made my leg fall asleep?
[29:45.06]You need to get up and move around.
[29:46.04]Need a clean headshot.
[29:51.80]Oh, fuck.
[29:52.24]There's somebody behind him.
[29:54.49]Give me the potion.
[30:03.98]Why is this like Counter-Strike?
[30:05.20]Do I have to stop moving and crouch to get a better shot?
[30:23.00]Oh my god.
[30:26.42]Shoot him!
[30:30.48]Nice.
[30:34.46]Coffin reminder.
[30:35.18]Actually, thank you.
[30:43.96]Don't... Okay, don't touch any of them.
[30:45.84]None of them are safe, apparently.
[30:47.02]This is where we... It was where we fucked up last night.
[30:49.72]This is what ended the stream yesterday, by the way.
[30:52.74]That one in the middle right there.
[30:53.94]Don't go near it.
[30:56.54]Don't- don't even fuck around.
[30:57.68]Did you see what just happened?
[30:58.56]Nope.
[31:01.28]I don't- there's no items in them.
[31:03.93]Okay, fine.
[31:06.35]Could that have crushed me?
[31:10.99]Don't even go near it.
[31:11.83]Don't go near it.
[31:13.56]Ah!
[31:14.42]I'm jumpy today and it's annoying.
[31:22.79]I think there's something in the coffin.
[31:24.79]That's annoying.
[31:25.57]Did you see that?
[31:30.13]Something... The one in the middle.
[31:45.54]What's this?
[31:51.01]What's this?
[31:51.35]Alright, let me take a look at the map.
[31:52.29]I wanna make sure I'm not gonna get lost.
[31:54.65]Alright, we got a hallway here and we got one all the way down there.
[31:58.33]Sick.
[31:58.61]Hey, I just got a delayed notification about the stream.
[32:02.95]What the fuck, Twitch?
[32:05.09]What's going on with these sub boxes?
[32:07.52]What's going on with the sub box, Twitch?
[32:09.02]I feel like I'm in a time machine from 15 years ago.
[32:20.94]Clown music.
[32:26.94]Help!
[32:27.50]We need to work together.
[32:28.16]Shoot him!
[32:30.48]Shoot him!
[32:31.00]Help me!
[32:31.78]You use your ammo too, not just me.
[32:37.30]Help!
[32:38.83]Do something!
[32:48.96]I just executed that guy.
[32:52.73]He wouldn't do anything.
[32:53.81]Oh my god.
[32:58.69]I didn't fucking know.
[33:01.89]I'm gonna run out of bullets.
[33:07.63]I actually cannot die because I have no save point.
[33:10.40]Don't fuck around actually.
[33:15.21]Can you aim at the one on the left?
[33:16.23]The one on the left is... That shit going down?
[33:22.42]Hold on.
[33:22.80]I'm gonna take my... I'm gonna take my first item of the fucking playthrough.
[33:29.76]What?
[33:33.34]That doesn't heal?
[33:34.06]That's not a heal!
[33:36.56]It has a soothing effect on you.
[33:38.28]Who gives a shit?
[33:39.26]What are you talking about?
[33:44.10]What is that then?
[33:51.40]I've been picking... That's not a heal.
[33:53.34]So what is a heal?
[33:54.34]Smelling salts?
[33:56.04]Drowsiness.
[33:57.15]What the fuck is going on?
[33:58.33]Alright, I actually have to... I don't think either of these are heals.
[34:06.50]Turning the gamer's sense on right now.
[34:08.38]I'm not fucking around.
[34:23.43]Got him.
[34:31.72]Got him.
[34:36.72]Thank God.
[34:37.54]Alright, so those are not heals.
[34:45.50]Oh, it's so good to see Abdul.
[34:53.36]What is he up to, by the way?
[34:58.57]He kind of just nonchalantly shows up to these things.
[35:17.28]Locked?
[35:18.48]Alright, this is locked.
[35:19.46]Remember this.
[35:20.54]I want you guys to- I want you guys to do a laser scan of this entire game.
[35:25.40]So when I ask, hey, do you remember where that one locked door was down that red hallway?
[35:30.53]You can tell me immediately.
[35:31.67]Go ahead and scan this right here.
[35:36.29]Get that scanned in.
[35:37.33]Thank you.
[35:38.97]Yeah, this one, get over here too, just to make sure you have it as well.
[35:47.24]Got it.
[35:48.68]Nice job.
[35:49.05]Appreciate it.
[35:55.95]Grab the stairs too, just in case, just to know that there's a staircase in front of it.
[36:06.34]I like the one person foot galore, but it just went... I almost just ruined the whole game.
[36:20.18]Oh, so good to see you.
[36:24.56]Yes, I want to access Abdul's inventory.
[36:27.67]He's got nothing.
[36:28.83]Because I took it all already.
[36:37.63]I like the other, the emote, the looking emote too.
[36:39.59]That was cute.
[36:40.07]I like that.
[36:44.21]Thank God there's a save.
[36:51.42]Alright, let's keep going.
[37:03.32]Slow it down.
[37:04.83]Fuck you!
[37:05.53]Why?
[37:05.73]I wasn't like this last night.
[37:07.97]Come on, man.
[37:08.79]It's a fucking 25-year-old video game.
[37:10.79]And sometimes it's the most scary, by the way.
[37:20.68]You know, I still get scared of the original Resident Evil zombie.
[37:24.36]Way more scary than anything else.
[37:28.30]Polly and I have talked about this before, but there's something about a kind of a low-poly, weird version of something.
[37:35.73]If there's a very highly detailed Unreal Engine 5 zombie monster, I'm just like, I don't care.
[37:40.13]That's not scary.
[37:40.93]I don't care.
[37:42.79]But if it's a weird, poorly animated, like kind of pixely, ugly looking thing, it's actually worse.
[37:49.22]Way worse.
[38:03.34]Oh shit.
[38:03.50]I feel like I'm gonna run out of bullets.
[38:09.66]Okay, are the smelling salts actually heal?
[38:20.12]Do you have to fully lock in the aim before firing?
[38:22.70]I don't know, but I feel like it does more damage somehow.
[38:25.56]That just might be a placebo.
[38:31.50]I'm dying.
[38:32.61]I'm actually going to die.
[38:38.65]Is this actually a heal?
[38:45.64]It is.
[38:52.30]I'm still choking on the gas or whatever it is, though.
[38:58.29]So wait, is this a heal and this like a cure?
[39:03.35]Is this to stop that?
[39:12.94]Nice, dude.
[39:14.68]We don't give a fuck.
[39:15.80]We don't give a fuck.
[39:16.94]We don't give a fuck.
[39:30.05]Anything here?
[39:40.26]Put that violin down.
[39:41.92]I feel like if you were a violinist, and you were practicing and you really want to do horror movie music, you want to do horror stuff, there's a lot of cool things you can do with a violin and make like scary music.
[39:59.03]I don't know if I'd want to live with somebody that's practicing.
[40:03.75]I feel like that'd be terrifying.
[40:04.85]If your roommate or, like, something like a sibling or, like, your parents or your kids or whatever.
[40:09.81]Don't you think that's a horrifying thing to have to listen to?
[40:12.71]Like, oh yeah, you're practicing in the other room and it's like... Just, like, scary fucking violin sound effects.
[40:22.96]I'd get up at, like, two o'clock in the morning and, you know, kids practicing the horror violin.
[40:27.50]I'd feel like, like, a ghost was gonna come possess me.
[40:40.04]Wait, there's more stuff over here, I think.
[40:45.50]Better than my kid trying to play ACDC.
[40:51.85]Wait, wait, wait, you mean you don't want to hear?
[40:53.91]That's it.
[41:20.66]Not going to curse me.
[41:27.65]I told you guys that a long time ago, I really wanted to learn how to play the piano or the keyboard.
[41:32.27]And I remember deliberately learning how to play that... What's that song from Chrono Cross?
[41:44.56]And I phonetically, just by feel, memorized that whole sequence.
[41:50.04]I don't have no idea how to play the piano.
[41:52.63]But I can do that one thing.
[41:54.13]And I think I did it during the Labo piano stream.
[42:00.65]I don't know anything else.
[42:01.47]That's the only thing I know how to do.
[42:02.71]If you put a piano... If you put a piano in front of me, I could do that.
[42:05.19]At least that part.
[42:10.77]Any other music?
[42:11.43]No, I can't do it.
[42:14.69]Bro, you have Beethoven?
[42:16.01]No, I am not.
[42:16.97]That's not... No, I'm not.
[42:33.05]No, don't- I gotta not use the gun for this.
[42:34.89]I'm gonna be so mad if I use all my bullets.
[42:36.89]Do you have perfect pitch?
[42:39.63]Uh, yeah, I think I have perfect pitch.
[42:40.73]Let's try it.
[42:44.09]Do... Wait, you're not gonna do this during a horror game.
[42:50.27]Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.. Perfect pitch.
[43:06.81]I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-
[43:39.00]Doesn't count.
[43:55.15]And then when you add a little bit more to it.
[44:06.08]Contemplating whether or not I should do this one.
[44:09.42]Okay, I just saw the future in a crystal ball.
[44:12.82]This is not going over well.
[44:14.80]And that's why I stopped.
[44:19.93]Nothing else in here?
[44:24.91]This is a weird... What is this?
[44:25.84]This is weird.
[44:29.98]Why does it run like this?
[44:37.49]Okay, well there's a heater in this room.
[44:38.63]Can I get a scan in this room, please?
[44:44.25]Specifically a scan of this part of the map, please?
[44:51.06]Hey, should I have dog food for dinner?
[44:52.60]Just ban that person for trying so hard.
[45:06.78]Scanned?
[45:07.58]Good.
[45:11.45]And then mod them.
[45:13.01]And then unmod them.
[45:15.75]And then ban them again.
[45:24.30]No, wrong button.
[45:44.48]You got a norovirus?
[45:45.86]That sucks, actually.
[45:50.71]Have I told the norovirus story how my whole family got it one time?
[45:53.51]And I thought I- me and my father thought we made it out.
[45:59.52]We were like, yeah, hey, we're the strong ones in the family.
[46:02.24]Have I ever told that story?
[46:10.85]Okay, so my whole family one time got norovirus.
[46:12.78]It was awful.
[46:13.42]It literally wiped out the whole family.
[46:14.87]We're talking like 10 people.
[46:17.29]And the thing about when you have a sickness like that, it hits somebody.
[46:22.13]Then over the course of four, five, six hours, two more people kind of go down.
[46:27.61]Three more people kind of go down.
[46:28.91]It's like, oh shit, this is hitting everybody.
[46:31.71]And over the course of, I want to say like six to 12 hours, or maybe like one day or so, like one full day, it had gotten to the point where it was the evening.
[46:41.17]And everybody in the family that had been around each other was talking about how they had it.
[46:47.18]And me and my father didn't get it.
[46:49.84]We were still fine.
[46:51.40]And I remember I have a distinct memory of me looking at my dad across the room, being like, hey, hey, hey, those jeans, alright, we got the good ones, don't we?
[47:03.40]And I remember having distinct, horrific, nauseating feeling after making direct eye contact with him after saying that.
[47:10.81]And I remember I walked over to the sink and I was pretending that I was fine.
[47:14.87]I pretended I was fine.
[47:17.21]I was like, ah, yeah, we sure do.
[47:20.04]That's right, dad.
[47:21.78]And it was like, oh, no, something's wrong right now.
[47:24.44]And I went over to the sink and I was like pretending to do the dishes.
[47:27.05]I was like, I'm going to do the dishes for a minute.
[47:30.17]And then, you know, that feeling where like the whole world is kind of closing in.
[47:40.47]I was like, oh shit, the world's kind of closing in.
[47:42.37]I feel terrible.
[47:43.19]And I was like, no, it can't be.
[47:45.19]I'm fine.
[47:46.13]It didn't get us.
[47:47.27]It didn't hit me and dad.
[47:48.57]And I slowly, like, still was pretending to be fine.
[47:53.23]I, like, walked over to the bathroom and was like, I just want to go in here and powder my nose for a minute.
[48:03.33]And then I puked and shit at the same time.
[48:07.61]And I distinctly remember my father just was like, oh shit.
[48:18.43]It sucks though.
[48:19.23]It's so bad.
[48:20.15]It is so bad.
[48:21.54]Wait, I want to save it here.
[48:34.62]Why'd you say that your family got wiped out?
[48:40.59]What do you, what do you mean?
[48:41.75]That's what happened.
[48:43.31]Hey, you pull the context clues out of that.
[48:44.93]Okay.
[48:52.51]Where do I need to go?
[48:53.73]This way.
[48:57.75]Where have I not been?
[48:59.16]Okay.
[48:59.34]I've not been in this room.
[49:10.26]Confidence surges as the enemy crumbles.
[49:14.88]Confidence crumbles as the enemy surges.
[49:18.54]Run.
[49:32.45]Did your dad disown you after being weak and catching the virus?
[49:37.03]No, it got him, I think, like, 40 minutes later.
[49:41.39]No, no, no, no, son of mine isn't going to give... I thought we had the good genes.
[49:48.50]I was totally wrong about you.
[49:58.12]This takes a lot of health down and I'm just realizing it right now.
[50:00.62]I need to fuck the heal.
[50:01.90]This actually has gotten way worse.
[50:09.06]I actually might be able to softlock myself or have to be a gamer.
[50:13.06]You're describing the story like a zombie outbreak.
[50:17.32]That is somebody that has not had to necessarily experience an entire family getting shut down from norovirus.
[50:24.45]That's exactly how it is.
[50:26.05]That's exactly what it feels like.
[50:27.07]This guy's just on fire.
[50:40.07]What?
[50:41.11]You're gonna leave me in here with him?
[50:43.07]What the fuck?
[50:45.71]What happened to him?
[50:49.66]There's too many enemies in this room.
[50:54.74]Oh, shit.
[50:56.20]Oh, shit.
[50:58.66]Oh, shit.
[51:01.03]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[51:14.56]I'm going to walk over there and this guy's going to be sitting there just going, die, die, die.
[51:20.30]See?
[51:20.74]Yep.
[51:20.94]Okay.
[51:21.18]So you definitely have to make sure it's honed in.
[51:24.18]Yep.
[51:24.82]Oh yeah.
[51:25.16]Yep.
[51:26.46]Yep.
[51:29.54]Oh yeah.
[51:29.90]Yep.
[51:34.41]Yep.
[51:45.43]He's gonna get killed.
[51:50.39]Who's breathing?
[51:50.99]You hear that?
[51:54.97]Can I play the piano?
[52:12.36]This thing actually sucks.
[52:13.76]That curse is so, so, so bad.
[52:15.98]Alright.
[52:20.28]I really need to start to avoid it.
[52:22.70]Because that does such an unbelievable... That does a tremendous amount of damage.
[52:27.82]Tremendous.
[52:43.09]It's still looking.
[52:51.92]Open the door.
[52:52.44]Who's there?
[52:59.08]Don't come any closer.
[53:01.11]I ain't coming out.
[53:02.25]Oh, no.
[53:03.81]I lost me glasses.
[53:05.35]They was chasing me.
[53:06.47]I can't see nothing without me glasses.
[53:09.15]I ain't coming out, I say.
[53:10.85]Fighting with fire, yeah.
[53:12.58]They ain't natural, see.
[53:14.52]Those inventions in the Eaton Combustion Exhibition.
[53:17.18]Flame throwers.
[53:18.62]Fighting with fire.
[53:20.14]It's our only chance.
[53:21.90]Oh dear me, I can't see nothing.
[53:24.88]A young lady, you say.
[53:26.18]Glasses.
[53:27.48]You find me glasses, and I'll help you find her.
[53:29.94]I ain't going nowhere without me glasses.
[53:37.67]Glasses.
[53:38.73]Find your glasses.
[53:39.33]Okay.
[53:41.17]Glasses?
[53:42.75]Open the fucking door.
[54:05.54]Menthol, good.
[54:06.36]Let's take a look at the map.
[54:11.04]So... Um... Um... Go this way.
[54:24.05]Glasses.
[54:24.39]I don't know if it would be glasses.
[54:28.21]Thank goodness.
[54:31.91]Thank goodness.
[54:36.92]Funny toilet thing.
[54:47.43]We good?
[54:47.83]Anything else?
[54:48.29]I think that's everything in here.
[54:50.25]Alright, let's look at the map.
[54:54.55]Uh, there's a door I can go in out here straight through the door and then out straight ahead.
[55:02.04]I'm glad I actually came down here though.
[55:05.12]You gonna do a cigarette tier list?
[55:06.24]Yeah, they're all gross.
[55:21.64]This one's locked.
[55:22.38]This is where he is.
[55:25.24]Okay, I can cut around this way.
[55:26.74]Alright, let's go through here.
[55:35.22]Except this one, which is your favorite brand.
[55:36.82]I'm not gonna say the name of the brand.
[55:38.13]You're not gonna catch me saying that.
[55:52.97]Yeah, you'll clip it.
[55:57.20]It's a thing in the information age.
[56:01.03]clip something and then just cut this part down and cut that part down and then cut the edge off that one.
[56:18.26]Look at the glasses.
[56:20.52]I've been in here.
[56:23.23]I've been in here.
[56:23.97]Alright.
[56:24.23]With the up there, the locked door.
[56:28.91]He said to get the flamethrower.
[56:30.11]Maybe can I actually do anything with this now?
[56:35.79]Fighting ghosts right now?
[56:36.81]What, you don't like making a guy up and getting mad at him?
[56:46.09]What, you don't make up a whole scenario to get annoyed at?
[56:48.18]Oh.
[56:51.82]We are in great danger.
[56:59.70]I'm so glad I can save it.
[57:08.67]So I have to find... a flamethrower.
[57:16.15]And the only info I got was, keep looking.
[57:21.15]Keep looking.
[57:28.93]Don't forget about the glasses.
[57:31.03]They weren't in here, were they?
[57:36.84]You guys scanned the room already.
[57:38.36]Did you find any anomalies?
[57:40.02]What's going on?
[57:40.70]I thought you scanned it.
[57:48.27]No, they're not in here.
[57:59.87]Nothing detected, sir.
[58:06.80]I love this game.
[58:07.64]This game is really... I actually love this.
[58:09.90]Alright, up the stairs.
[58:14.72]Maybe up the stairs, or should I go... Alright.
[58:16.82]I want a meeting of the council real quick.
[58:19.13]Bang a right to go up the stairs and go straight, or go straight, bang a right, bang a left, and go down that little hallway in the top left.
[58:29.59]It's Resident Evil, but worse.
[58:31.17]It's Resident Evil, but easier.
[58:32.33]There you go.
[58:39.73]Bang it right.
[58:45.69]Resident Easier.
[58:46.61]Oh, that's the title now.
[58:49.89]That has to be the title for the video series.
[58:52.33]Resident Easier.
[58:55.35]That's perfect.
[59:01.83]I'm going to bang right.
[59:02.41]We'll go back upstairs.
[59:07.89]Looking for glasses.
[59:19.93]Ah, Osiris.
[59:23.60]Immortalized as god of the underworld, according to myth, Osiris was cruelly murdered and later dismembered by his jealous brother, Set.
[59:42.59]What the hell was that?
[59:45.75]Don't go in the coffin.
[59:47.23]It's just, these are just scary haunted house moments.
[59:48.97]That's all this is.
[59:54.22]Oh no, uh... Who would walk the- okay, if I'm at a museum and this is an exi- this is like an exhibit.
[60:04.95]I am not walking through this door.
[60:07.31]I'm not walking through that door.
[60:09.48]If this is actually a museum... No, what?
[60:13.24]I'm gonna get crushed.
[60:17.52]Why am I looking out the window?
[60:20.22]The moonlight casts curious shadows on the walls beyond.
[60:22.66]Are they moving?
[60:29.67]Glasses.
[60:31.53]Yep.
[60:32.93]Let's go.
[60:34.11]Hell yeah.
[60:36.68]Glasses.
[60:39.49]Walking through this is going to kill me.
[60:42.99]It just is, right?
[60:46.09]I really don't want to... Where is this?
[60:48.08]Up the stairs?
[60:48.60]I don't want to do this again.
[60:51.30]I know the funny thing to do is to just walk through this and have the cutscene happen and I get crushed and everybody laughs.
[61:01.91]Just pretend I did it.
[61:18.05]Yeah, like, I got crushed.
[61:19.19]Oh, haha, that's funny.
[61:20.03]I got crushed.
[61:24.43]What the hell?
[61:28.55]And I lost all that progress.
[61:31.31]That is so annoying.
[61:34.43]Whatever, though.
[61:35.26]It's fine.
[61:36.70]I got a checkpoint, so it's fine.
[61:39.76]The only checkpoint in the whole game, right in front of that.
[61:41.66]That's crazy.
[61:42.98]But we're good, we're good, we're good.
[61:44.44]I know it was funny, whatever, but...
[61:54.11]OK, where is he?
[61:54.81]Right here.
[61:56.53]Look what I got.
[62:04.48]Where is he?
[62:07.32]Yeah, I have him in my hand.
[62:11.64]How do I give you the glasses?
[62:22.74]I have to put them on?
[62:23.52]Wear them in front of him?
[62:24.92]Step on them in front of him.
[62:26.52]This is weird.
[62:27.10]Why is this not working?
[62:28.54]Okay, I should have been in the right spot.
[62:52.81]Slide them under the door.
[62:56.97]This guy's going to get killed.
[63:00.21]Who are you?
[63:01.71]And what are you doing here?
[63:02.47]I got a break coming up here.
[63:03.41]Okay.
[63:04.41]Oh.
[63:04.61]I know the code.
[63:23.63]Remember the code to open it.
[63:26.15]The code book is in a staff room on the ground floor.
[63:30.22]Remember that much?
[63:32.16]But make sure you've got them flamethrowers from the Eaton Combustion Room.
[63:36.68]Fight them with fire, yeah?
[63:38.36]Okay.
[63:38.66]Come back here and we'll get the spare key out of the safe.
[63:41.52]I'm so done with this guy.
[63:42.58]You can get to the ISIS exhibition.
[63:45.97]Alright.
[63:46.31]Alright, I'll be back.
[63:49.73]I'll take that key and I'll come back from break.
[63:53.39]See you guys in a few minutes.
[63:57.62]Take me glasses.
[68:18.82]Welcome back.
[68:19.56]How are you?
[68:20.44]Alright, got the glasses.
[68:24.02]Now I got a key.
[68:25.85]To some... Sorry.
[68:29.87]Just walked around for a second.
[68:31.47]I just walked for like a minute.
[68:32.83]Oh man.
[68:39.24]Alright, let's get the key.
[68:41.52]Cool.
[68:43.58]Heat and combustion exhibition key.
[68:46.84]Didn't I already go in there?
[68:57.00]Or is it right here?
[68:57.74]It's not this door right here, is it?
[69:07.09]Wait, what the heck?
[69:12.55]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:13.77]Where is it?
[69:24.40]Back to the urn and glass room.
[69:28.66]Oh, shit.
[69:29.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[69:30.83]Appreciate the skin.
[69:31.67]Okay.
[69:35.71]It's over here.
[69:39.20]And over here.
[69:42.30]How's everybody doing?
[69:43.08]How are... How you doing?
[69:45.72]How you doing?
[69:48.59]Yeah?
[69:50.17]Oh, fuck.
[70:02.39]Okay, so I think it's in this room.
[70:05.11]There's... Let me see the map.
[70:14.00]Uh, is it left and then right and then up the stairs?
[70:16.88]Let's try that.
[70:17.36]We just lost 300 viewers for asking that.
[70:28.02]You don't know any- you don't know anything about what people are doing, okay?
[70:31.65]Those people might be gardening right now.
[70:33.09]They're gonna come back.
[70:34.39]They'll be back.
[70:35.93]Right?
[70:36.15]They'll be back.
[70:41.27]The- to the new collection.
[70:42.77]I don't think this is it.
[70:47.31]Nope.
[70:53.93]Can't be that far.
[70:56.20]Maybe this way?
[70:56.80]Right and then right?
[71:00.02]Don't go in.
[71:00.68]Wait.
[71:03.34]There's something in that coffin in the middle.
[71:05.44]There is.
[71:07.06]You see it too, don't you?
[71:09.65]We all see it.
[71:10.63]It's right there.
[71:17.09]What do I do about this?
[71:37.13]There's something in here!
[71:38.07]I got stuck in the one... I got stuck in that one.
[71:41.71]Oh, thank God.
[71:53.26]I thought I got stuck again.
[71:58.92]Oh, thank goodness.
[71:59.60]We're fine.
[72:03.57]Everything's alright.
[72:04.37]Everybody relax.
[72:09.16]Is it this one?
[72:10.14]No, this is the new collection.
[72:14.88]This way?
[72:31.44]Nice house tour.
[72:39.64]There's a locked door here.
[72:41.02]It's probably it right here.
[72:47.13]Fuck.
[72:48.45]It's not it.
[72:52.93]Okay.
[72:57.68]I think it's down the elevator.
[72:59.88]Somebody said.
[73:02.12]Okay, well.
[73:06.20]It's not up here.
[73:07.18]So down, all the way back down, all the way back.
[73:09.36]Back to the vase room.
[73:11.12]The vase room.
[73:23.29]Oh my fuck.
[73:24.95]I just walked in there.
[73:25.63]Okay, where are we now?
[73:32.33]Back into the vase room?
[73:36.94]Or this way?
[73:37.58]This takes me back to that kind of big room.
[73:53.11]Okay, then this is the vase room.
[74:01.03]And then from here... Wait, wait, let me take a look from here.
[74:09.85]There's nothing else back here.
[74:11.77]Maybe go back up that top left, that red door with the gap.
[74:16.98]Go left, you bozo.
[74:18.46]Don't call me a bozo.
[74:19.38]We're looking for the fire exhibit.
[74:31.55]I'm going to try just going... I don't know.
[74:33.13]I feel like I'm going to get lost if I go up there and across.
[74:37.18]Have I come across the fire exhibition room?
[74:39.54]Whatever it is.
[74:39.98]Elevator should be the square right before what you said with the red.
[74:45.90]I don't know what that means.
[74:52.74]Wait, did I say that?
[75:04.75]Game map not labeling rooms is crazy.
[75:08.23]Yeah, and okay, in Resident Evil, if there's a, like a club room, it'll be, that's a club room.
[75:14.17]All these are just doors that are locked.
[75:16.07]So I have no fucking idea.
[75:17.77]I'm going to go this way and see.
[75:19.11]It might be one of these out here.
[75:20.19]Oh, wait.
[75:36.54]Elevator?
[75:36.84]Can I go on this?
[75:40.83]Whoa!
[75:53.23]Just crack open this brush.
[75:54.93]You know what it is.
[75:56.39]You know what it is.
[75:56.95]I don't need to... I don't need to tell you what it is.
[76:11.33]Oh my god.
[76:22.08]Is this it?
[76:23.80]Heat and combustion room.
[76:35.14]Nope.
[76:39.62]This one looks like it's going to be messed up.
[76:45.42]Get my spell cast ready.
[76:48.72]Is it an old telephone back in the ancient times?
[76:55.44]Interesting.
[76:55.87]I wonder how they made the calls with it.
[77:06.55]Caveman telephone.
[77:08.23]Oh, he's the first calculator, right?
[77:12.98]This music is so scary that it puts out gas.
[77:22.69]It's really dark in here.
[77:24.05]Where's my lantern?
[77:34.01]What's wrong with this guy's head?
[77:38.78]His head is like in his shoulders.
[77:42.04]Is this guy for real or is he a scary guy?
[77:49.99]See what I mean?
[77:50.63]What is he doing?
[78:03.76]Alright, something goes in here.
[78:04.72]He didn't tell me there's somebody who's just dead on the ground.
[78:14.45]Pull the plunger.
[78:21.46]When was this in ancient Egypt?
[78:28.42]What?
[78:33.30]What the fuck is going on?
[78:34.60]Who just did that?
[78:35.53]Why did you do that?
[78:36.25]Do you think he did that?
[78:38.29]I did that!
[78:45.98]What a lunatic.
[78:50.55]There's no cleave.
[79:02.01]Oh!
[79:02.25]I can get hit by this.
[79:03.32]Get up!
[79:03.56]Get up!
[79:03.78]Get up!
[79:04.12]Don't die!
[79:04.50]Don't die!
[79:04.82]Seriously, get... No, I can't die.
[79:05.92]I can't die.
[79:06.32]I can't die.
[79:06.68]You can get hit by this.
[79:07.26]I actually am freaking out right now.
[79:10.12]He pushed me in the carousel.
[79:13.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[79:13.94]Heal.
[79:14.26]Heal.
[79:14.62]Come on.
[79:17.77]Did you hear the real terror in my voice?
[79:19.25]It's been a long time since I saved.
[79:23.74]Oh my god, you are so bad.
[79:25.08]Dude, you're fucking terrible.
[79:35.24]Don't!
[79:35.68]Stop!
[79:36.38]It's funny, but it's just worth dying over?
[79:38.56]Dude, you suck at this.
[79:51.51]I didn't know that you could get smashed by this thing.
[79:53.55]What did I just get the key?
[80:01.14]You're taking the heat and combustion staff room key.
[80:12.63]Reload.
[80:13.61]I'm not messing around right now.
[80:20.69]Where's the staff room?
[80:23.05]Uh, straight around the... Wait.
[80:28.87]This shit's electrified.
[80:29.81]Can I turn it off?
[80:40.34]How do I turn it off?
[80:54.45]You can walk through this.
[80:58.47]No, you cannot.
[81:01.63]Are you telling me I have... That's the window I have?
[81:06.36]I'm at times five speed.
[81:11.16]That's the window.
[81:17.40]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[81:31.35]One.
[81:32.07]Two.
[81:32.83]What the f- No, man!
[81:34.59]I can't even count it.
[81:36.23]I'm just gonna go.
[81:36.69]Ready?
[81:37.95]One.
[81:40.01]Ow!
[81:44.00]How long ago was the save?
[81:49.62]The save was so long ago.
[81:54.33]Oh, fuck.
[81:56.77]It was so long ago.
[82:01.83]No!
[82:02.65]No!
[82:03.51]I thought I really had to do what I just did!
[82:05.61]How long ago is this?
[82:07.69]Did I get the glasses at this point?
[82:14.83]No way!
[82:16.07]No way!
[82:16.89]How long ago is this?
[82:17.63]I don't remember anything!
[82:18.46]I just lost like 40 minutes of progress!
[82:27.88]Do I have the glasses?
[82:30.26]Shit!
[82:32.04]I don't even remember where this is.
[82:33.26]Scanners!
[82:33.76]I need some scan help here.
[82:35.71]Which way was it?

[83:39.17]Downstairs left.
[83:42.13]I can't go anymore.
[83:43.15]I can't go any further.
[83:44.33]What do I do?
[83:45.41]There's something in front of me.
[83:46.45]I can't go any further.
[83:56.50]Uh, he's... Where is he?
[83:57.88]He's over here, right?

[84:17.43]Here are your glasses.
[84:19.29]Give me that shit right now.
[84:22.28]Gonna be the perfect spot for this.
[84:26.68]Good.
[84:39.02]Thank you.
[84:42.28]I'm looking up the Nostalgic Games TV long play video to help.
[84:46.12]That's funny.
[84:53.49]There's the key.
[84:54.11]I spent like 30 minutes walking around talking about, like, I don't know, what kind of ice cream I like.
[85:00.93]Now we gotta go back to the elevator.
[85:05.25]That elevator was out around straight this- I see it, it's over there.
[85:09.77]That was last night?
[85:17.39]No, it was not.
[85:18.10]It was yesterday.
[85:32.99]That was a burp and a half.
[85:37.89]Elevator is, where is it?
[85:41.37]Up and then left and go.
[85:43.02]Wait, did I do it wrong?
[86:02.11]Oh fuck, it's behind me.
[86:03.47]Why are you stalling on the alphabet speedrun?
[86:21.66]Alright, let's sneak around here right.
[86:31.52]It's this way.
[86:35.02]Through here.
[86:36.68]Elevator would be right here.
[86:37.44]And then I've made it back.
[86:41.48]Okay.
[86:41.90]Thank goodness.
[86:45.78]Here it is.
[86:48.50]Good.
[86:51.86]I did not lose that much progress.
[86:52.94]We're fine.
[86:53.22]I just have to remember all the chain of events that happened here.
[86:59.82]Say the alphabet as fast as you can.
[87:01.18]Sure.
[87:16.18]This is the combustion room.
[87:19.20]Whoops.
[87:19.44]Family Guy joke?
[87:22.30]Yeah, that actually is a Family Guy joke.
[87:26.00]That's actually truly from Family Guy.
[87:36.85]It's genuinely directly from that show.
[87:43.16]Hi.
[87:43.48]Hi.
[87:47.05]Yeah, so instead of... Let me get all this shit.
[87:55.92]You found a flamethrower.
[87:58.90]I... Could I just... Did I softlock the game by turning on the electricity?
[88:01.96]He drops the key.
[88:09.50]What if I just shoot this guy?
[88:26.78]Because I turn this on, the goons come out and they're like, Oi, what are you doing here?
[88:31.50]And then I can't come over here again.
[88:35.97]According to the long play, you can go through the electricity.
[88:38.63]You have to time it.
[88:40.71]Oh my god.
[88:41.77]Okay, I'm going to get full health for this.
[88:47.06]I got full health right now.
[88:49.98]Load the gun.
[88:50.54]They're terrible shots.
[88:51.92]I'm fine.
[89:00.12]Turn the FPS down maybe?
[89:01.18]It's not a bad idea.
[89:02.70]How have I just laughed at that?
[89:13.97]I shot that guy in the head.
[89:22.98]Right in the face actually.
[89:25.79]Uh-oh.
[89:37.27]Can he shoot?
[89:38.73]Can Tweedledee and Tweedledum shoot each other?
[89:40.45]I just tried to dodge roll.
[89:49.82]That's how weird my brain is right now.
[90:00.34]Why are they shooting four times?
[90:07.05]How do you miss point blank?
[90:10.79]No!
[90:12.55]No!
[90:12.81]I'm stuck!
[90:14.55]Fucking come on, dude!
[90:18.03]I can't do this shit!
[90:20.12]No!
[90:21.66]I got stun locked!
[90:28.72]Just take out the baton and beat the shit out of him.
[90:32.39]The gun is a finicky piece of crap.
[90:35.69]I have to hold it and wait for the right moment.
[90:39.11]And you still have to hit him six times.
[90:41.23]I killed them both with the baton in 10 seconds.
[90:45.08]Oh my God.
[90:46.24]Okay, at least I know where to... Give me all this shit.
[90:53.70]Give me all your money.
[90:58.15]I'm so annoyed right now, you have no idea.
[91:00.03]This shit sucks.
[91:08.73]Alright, alright, alright, okay.
[91:11.77]Oh, I don't want to do this the third time.
[91:16.80]Save maybe right before going in the elevator?
[91:18.46]That's a good idea.
[91:19.40]That is a very smart idea.
[91:21.02]Alright, go get the glasses.
[91:34.19]Alright, and I cannot for some reason put this shit into long-term memory.
[91:39.73]I can't.
[91:44.05]The glasses are up here.
[91:55.94]Scary.
[91:56.24]Have you played this already?
[92:04.06]Yeah, I know.
[92:04.98]Dude, 985 viewers!
[92:09.38]9850!
[92:09.40]Oh, what the f- What the heck?
[92:14.69]That's so cool.
[92:25.53]Alright, give him the glasses back.
[92:27.02]He's straight and then around.
[92:45.21]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[92:46.29]This is the way to the elevator.
[92:48.53]Yeah.
[92:49.25]I've got this wrong.
[92:50.65]Turn around.
[93:02.68]The old guy is with the glasses is right here.
[93:06.02]I don't know.
[93:09.86]I can't put this shit in the long-term memory because you know why?
[93:12.04]It's because every time I've done this,
[93:16.47]I have said, there's no way I'm doing this again.
[93:18.63]So I just forget the whole thing, because why would I need to remember it?
[93:20.87]I'm never coming back here.
[93:36.60]Oh god, come on.
[93:41.78]Come on!
[93:48.54]I'm trying to give these to you so bad you have no idea.
[94:13.04]You got a worse long-term memory than my hamster.
[94:18.74]Oh, mercy.
[94:19.40]Thank you.
[94:19.88]Thank you.
[94:20.64]Your hamster is... Bro, your hamster's stupid.
[94:24.04]Okay.
[94:24.89]I am a human.
[94:26.03]I am... I am a man.
[94:33.09]What?
[94:33.33]Your hamster is stupid!
[94:34.51]Doesn't mean he's not cute and loving and fun.
[94:38.39]He's dumb.
[94:39.65]He's real dumb.
[94:42.11]And yeah, I know.
[94:42.81]But he jumps just a backflip.
[94:46.31]That's cool.
[94:47.13]He's dumb.
[94:57.19]Okay.
[94:57.73]I'm gonna save the game.
[95:02.86]You don't know that.
[95:05.14]Yeah, I do.
[95:11.18]Why do you have a stupid emote of you looking like a hamster?
[95:15.20]That's a BTTV emote.
[95:16.53]I don't even know what that is.
[95:17.45]You have no idea how... Hold on, let me do the thing.
[95:30.59]You have... just... go.
[95:34.18]There we go.
[95:35.98]There we go.
[95:36.42]And there it is.
[95:37.80]And there we go.
[96:02.26]That emote's totally going to get deleted.
[96:03.66]You guys just made him too aware of it.
[96:05.28]That's true, yeah.
[96:06.02]Yeah, the thing's gone.
[96:10.98]Better get your uses out of it.
[96:12.72]Tomorrow night, shit is not here anymore.
[96:26.61]No, I can't delete it.
[96:27.49]It's too... I like it.
[96:30.84]Why does that one have a cra- Okay, the one with the- Okay, all the Among Us emotes are getting deleted.
[96:33.82]All of them.
[96:34.40]I just want to make you aware that all of them are gone.
[96:47.42]Yeah, if there is an Among Us themed emote that you're using on this channel, be prepared to have never- Don't ever be able to use it again.
[97:06.21]And just to be a total asshole, I might put the sus guy emote as a tier 3 sub option.
[97:13.84]Like, if you want to put that shit in here, you better fucking pay for it.
[97:29.54]I just fell to my knees and started bawling.
[97:34.63]Alright.
[97:35.27]I don't even have the gun equipped.
[97:36.81]There's no reason to... Oh, maybe I should put the flamethrower on and just burn him.
[97:43.90]Ah!
[98:13.79]I thought I was going to kill him.
[98:14.83]Alright.
[98:17.72]Here they come.
[98:18.38]No.
[98:18.88]Get this first.
[98:19.54]Mm-hmm.
[98:28.97]Make it work.
[98:29.99]Okay.
[98:30.91]Let's make it happen.
[98:31.93]Okay.
[98:52.45]Blood splatter.
[98:53.89]Oh look at how hard this is going to be now.
[99:07.02]That was, look at how much easier that is than using a gun.
[99:17.87]One.
[99:18.27]No, I'm counting this time for real.
[99:22.05]One.
[99:23.83]One.
[99:24.41]No.
[99:25.53]One.
[99:26.41]Two.
[99:27.33]Three.
[99:28.27]Four.
[99:29.19]Five.
[99:30.11]Six.
[99:31.01]Seven.
[99:32.01]Eight.
[99:33.91]One.
[99:34.81]Two.
[99:36.64]One.
[99:37.52]Two.
[99:41.10]Oh.
[99:48.49]No!
[99:48.99]Okay, I was going to say no, please.
[99:55.98]I didn't pick the key up from the guy.
[100:00.56]Shit!
[100:10.43]I got it.
[100:10.91]Stop making such a big deal out of it.
[100:16.52]Am I crazy?
[100:17.52]Somebody go back and watch a clip of this.
[100:19.48]This was going way, way crazier.
[100:25.29]Way crazier.
[100:26.23]A hundred times crazier.
[100:29.11]It really was.
[100:29.99]Am I crazy?
[100:34.49]It was like impossible the last time I came here.
[100:51.83]Nice.
[100:52.07]I don't want to get jumped at.
[101:02.88]Empty fuel canister.
[101:04.14]Yep.
[101:05.07]Nice.
[101:05.35]Okay.
[101:10.19]Staff book.
[101:10.77]Is that it?
[101:21.02]What is a staff book for?
[101:25.90]Its contents are in code.
[101:27.06]You'll need a museum staff member.
[101:29.38]Oh.
[101:29.64]Okay, so I could bring this back to the staff guy?
[101:37.01]Fill up the fuel canister.
[101:38.75]Go back to the guy with the staff book.
[101:43.51]What?
[101:43.63]Do you remember the name of this game?
[101:45.43]Without looking, the game is called Curse the...
[102:02.03]Good luck.
[102:03.59]Why can you go through this without a problem, by the way?
[102:07.21]Why can you do that?
[102:25.10]The name of the game is called Curse Death.
[102:33.50]Curse the Eye of Isis?
[102:37.26]Yep, I got it.
[102:37.78]Okay.
[102:43.00]He might have loot.
[102:44.40]It's not worth it.
[102:44.92]Who cares?
[102:49.16]That is so much easier.
[102:50.71]That's unbelievable how much easier that is.
[103:03.69]Alright, back to the fuel room.
[103:08.18]Back to the staff room.
[103:16.23]Alright, up the elevator.
[103:37.09]You'll learn to count and read at the same day.
[103:38.71]Hey, save or stupid.
[103:40.27]I see you're using a Among Us emote that is going to be deleted.
[103:44.78]As well as your comment right now.
[103:54.71]Okay.
[103:56.03]Old guy is around the corner.
[104:06.74]That's not even your emote.
[104:07.88]Wait, it's not?
[104:10.00]That's another streamer's emote.
[104:13.39]No, no.
[104:14.05]I thought somebody put that on BTTV from my stream.
[104:16.83]I can't delete other people's emotes.
[104:20.60]That's not how it works.
[104:40.73]I bet the hamster would have known that.
[104:42.29]Alright, let's fill up the fuel.
[104:52.30]Okay.
[104:56.02]Full fuel tank.
[104:59.69]I was gonna say, holy shit, Abdul, you have a ton of stuff.
[105:05.95]Save the game.
[105:07.55]And we're ready.
[105:08.71]I'm feeling super confident.
[105:09.67]I feel great.
[105:10.15]I feel... I feel invigorated.
[105:14.47]I got the fire now.
[105:26.81]There it is.
[105:27.26]Nice.
[105:32.27]Oh damn, this thing is going to be cool.
[105:34.75]I'm not going to use it in this room.
[105:37.05]I just want you to see it.
[105:38.69]What do you think about this?
[105:40.29]What do you think about that?
[105:42.83]Yeah.
[105:44.41]You know how much this costed on eBay?
[105:45.59]14 grand.
[105:47.23]You want to hold it?
[105:52.68]You want to hold it?
[105:54.98]It's made out of steel.
[106:00.51]Why do that when you can just hit somebody with a piece of wood?
[106:02.35]Alright, back to the staff room.
[106:24.11]Straight.
[106:24.87]Straight.
[106:25.39]Left.
[106:26.39]Right.
[106:45.73]Bro, I got a really stale French bread.
[106:49.29]I don't think you wanna fuck with me here.
[107:08.90]Uh-oh.
[107:09.50]They got him.
[107:10.26]I think they got to him.
[107:13.46]Did they get to him?
[107:24.54]No!
[107:24.86]Is he alright?
[107:44.31]I think he's alright.
[107:46.55]I hope he sticks around.
[107:47.43]He's going to turn into a monster.
[107:48.39]Also, I think I want to turn it up.
[107:51.18]Should I turn it up?
[108:17.37]Little bit.
[108:24.11]How's that?
[108:27.75]Anything else in here?
[108:41.54]Oh, mate, sorry, I just... You need to push it from the other side.
[108:44.48]I don't know if you've ever done this before.
[108:46.77]There he is!
[108:48.42]50 years of service.
[108:50.68]That's so cute.
[108:51.68]It's in his little room.
[108:52.96]I love this guy.
[108:53.68]It's gonna be sad when we have to remove his head.
[108:57.14]There you go.
[109:14.27]The keys are inside.
[109:16.69]The ISIS room itself is located beyond the Osiris collection.
[109:21.71]But take care, young sir.
[109:23.57]That's where they kept that statue.
[109:25.99]I always knew it was bad luck bringing it here.
[109:28.65]I need to sit down for a minute.
[109:31.87]Then I'll go over to the west side of the museum and open some of the other exhibits in case you want to look in there.
[109:40.22]Very nice.
[109:40.64]Okay, Egyptian room key.
[109:49.08]Let's get victory fanfare music for the first time ever?
[109:56.10]We've not gotten victory fanfare music.
[109:58.30]Alright.
[110:15.03]So we're going...
[110:19.47]We need to go to the Egyptian room?
[110:21.25]Anybody have any idea where that might be?
[110:31.46]Hold on, let me fix something here.
[110:33.32]Real quick.
[110:37.40]Hold on.
[110:40.44]Give me one sec.
[110:43.47]Looks good.
[110:46.37]Beautiful.
[110:49.26]And that's unfortunate.
[110:50.34]The game crashed.
[110:51.80]I knew it was going to crash.
[110:55.00]It was hanging for a second.
[110:56.88]It's alright.
[110:57.48]It's alright.
[110:57.83]It's okay.
[110:58.11]It's okay.
[111:00.71]I could feel it being weird.
[111:02.23]I was trying to prevent it, but it's okay.
[111:09.35]Oh my god.
[111:10.29]Come on.
[111:15.73]He's a psychic.
[111:16.99]I could feel it.
[111:19.73]Had to alt-tab.
[111:30.73]We're not that far away.
[111:31.63]We're literally right there.
[111:33.95]I saved it.
[111:34.35]I'm good.
[111:43.47]I had to alt-tab for a second.
[111:44.85]I felt... I felt it was going to be a problem.
[111:48.44]And I knew it was going to be a problem, but it's okay.
[111:50.59]Solution is there.
[111:51.43]Uh, then we go this way.
[111:58.67]Need to save more.
[112:04.28]Yeah, thankfully this is a 15 second walk that we lost.
[112:07.86]We're good.
[112:19.65]It's where you get the glasses.
[112:20.93]Oh, that's right.
[112:21.50]Okay.
[112:21.62]Alright.
[112:21.98]We're good.
[112:31.80]So it was your fault?
[112:33.51]Yes, it was.
[112:34.83]Absolutely.
[112:35.21]Okay.
[112:47.64]I think the audio is in a good spot now.
[112:50.58]Oh, look.
[112:50.76]Wait.
[112:50.92]Just in case I don't get this.
[113:20.17]Thank you.
[113:21.63]The voices are too quiet.
[113:24.73]Yeah, unfortunately, it's one of those games where all the sound is on one setting.
[113:29.85]So it's either have loud, explosive, like, picking up item sounds, and have the voices be fine, or, you know, it's one of those issues.
[113:40.59]I always knew it was bad luck bringing it here.
[113:45.18]I need to sit down for a minute.
[113:47.25]Okay, we're good.
[113:48.35]Back to that room.
[113:49.05]And we're going to continue the playthrough.
[113:51.13]We want the explosive picking up item sounds.
[113:52.48]I think you do.
[114:00.56]But not everybody else does.
[114:03.38]And I know that because I did, behind the scenes here, in the last few seconds, I had my mods.
[114:08.98]They polled everybody in the community.
[114:11.48]Individually, every single person.
[114:13.68]And about 70, 79% said they didn't want that to happen.
[114:20.27]Out of about 8,000 responses.
[114:23.63]Yeah, see?
[114:24.41]A lot of people saying that they did.
[114:31.19]I have to trust, you know, most people, what they want to do.
[114:33.47]Alright, back to the Osiris room.
[114:43.45]You promised you wouldn't lie to us anymore.
[114:45.73]That is never going to happen.
[114:47.51]I'm sorry, but I don't know where you got that info from, but it was wrong.
[114:50.23]Alright, I need to look at the... I need to look at the...
[114:59.91]um okay I know where I'm going let's go this way sounded like a tool chest coming downstairs okay right then back right
[115:30.93]This game of fishing in it?
[115:34.18]Sit down.
[115:47.48]And then... It's this way, right?
[115:55.56]This game of Coz?
[115:56.74]Yeah.
[116:03.79]Alright, here we are.
[116:16.74]What is he doing?
[116:17.62]He doesn't think that's the door.
[116:19.10]He's going to get crushed.
[116:22.42]Okay, we're going to watch it get crushed.
[116:24.84]Dude, don't you see this?
[116:39.06]You don't think that you would take a second to look at that?
[116:41.46]I knew they had it there for a reason.
[116:42.90]Oh, fuck.
[116:44.68]I actually need the gun.
[116:45.48]Should I try to torch him?
[116:48.51]Alright, let's test it.
[117:30.81]This thing sucks!
[117:46.54]This thing stinks.
[117:49.46]I got a lot of arrows too.
[118:11.64]Oh, fuck you!
[118:12.26]There's no gas!
[118:14.62]There's no gas here!
[118:18.06]Do I actually have to tank this?
[118:19.34]Whatever.
[118:21.26]What the fuck?!
[118:31.51]I... I thought I had protagonist armor.
[118:36.97]I...
[118:43.98]I walked over there before and it didn't do anything.
[118:54.19]Not so stupid now.
[118:55.79]I walked over there and it didn't do anything and then... So what am I supposed to do?
[119:01.80]I don't know.
[119:02.12]That's the door top.
[119:02.92]I don't know!
[119:14.46]You just made fun of that guy for dying.
[119:16.70]I thought it was a cutscene death.
[119:18.63]I didn't think you could actually die to it.
[119:24.31]Hey, you alright?
[119:38.56]Hey dude, you're a background character, not a main character.
[119:42.26]I'm okay with that.
[119:44.04]Can I just be one of the people that answers like a phone in one cutscene and just doesn't ever get shown ever again?
[119:49.50]I'm fine with that.
[119:58.97]You being unable to save is pissing me off.
[120:01.48]I am saving.
[120:03.30]Oh, thank you once again.
[120:05.96]I saved every opportunity I have.
[120:07.84]Yeah, not right- I didn't think I was gonna die!
[120:10.30]I thought I was gonna get another opportunity to go through the door.
[120:12.34]We haven't seen any new stuff since right here.
[120:14.99]That scared the shit out of me.
[120:19.97]I skipped the cutscene.
[120:39.68]Hey, the hamster's beating you right now.
[120:40.90]The hamster's doing that.
[120:41.62]Yeah, that's right.
[120:42.12]I'm doing a Twitch thing where I'm playing this game alongside a hamster.
[120:48.43]The hamster's in a little hamster enclosure.
[120:52.81]And there's four buttons in the enclosure that correspond to X, A, B, and Y. And then there's a little device that's on the back of the hamster that is like just determining like a gyroscope.
[121:05.00]And that's the analog.
[121:06.55]And currently, he is, I think, 10 to 15 minutes ahead of me right now.
[121:13.09]And when he walks over buttons, it'll do it.
[121:16.20]His perspective is actually pretty interesting.
[121:32.72]Alright, let me go save it so I don't have to do this again.
[121:34.66]I'm going the right way, right?
[121:36.98]No, I'm not.
[121:37.96]It's this way.
[121:42.87]I think I have an ingrown hair on my face and it's annoying me.
[122:03.84]Show it on camera.
[122:05.74]My camera is like 200p.
[122:07.47]Alright, I'm gonna save the game.
[122:30.23]And then I got an ad coming up here.
[122:31.57]Get a break.
[122:34.81]We're making good progress though, don't worry.
[122:36.77]Things are going well.
[122:48.85]Alright, good position.
[122:52.85]I got my... I'm not even gonna use the flamethrower, I'm gonna use the gun.
[123:01.51]So let me actually get up to that spot and then we'll take a break.
[123:05.58]And I'll be back in a few minutes.
[123:19.35]Use the stale baguette.
[123:29.02]Flamethrower will remove the gas clouds.
[123:31.46]That's good to know.
[123:32.60]Okay, so here we are.
[123:33.40]Um... We'll keep the scary music.
[123:37.67]The other music is a little too much for three minutes.
[123:40.81]I just don't move.
[123:41.41]I won't move from here.
[123:42.03]Alright, be right back.
[123:46.25]See you in three minutes.
[123:48.13]Maybe four.
[128:45.90]Welcome back.
[128:47.80]So I've just been informed that I am one hour and ten minutes into what is a six hour playthrough.
[128:59.99]I'm about a fifth of the way through.
[129:01.31]I thought I was getting to the end of the game.
[129:03.93]I was like, oh man, we're really getting to the end of the game here.
[129:07.37]I'm about one fifth of the way through this game.
[129:18.76]Yeah, but what about all the fun we've had?
[129:22.26]That accounts for something.
[129:25.36]Didn't he play for over an hour last night?
[129:32.08]I mean, maybe like an hour and a half.
[129:35.04]And then like maybe an hour and a half today.
[129:39.50]But you forget about the streamer debuff.
[129:43.29]You're forgetting about the annoying streamer debuff, which is for every one minute of content, there's two minutes of me stopping like this.
[129:52.00]And talking to you for two to three minutes.
[129:55.00]That's the annoying... I'm an annoying streamer.
[129:57.28]That's an annoying streamer debuff, so... I'm not even annoying.
[130:04.71]You're annoying.
[130:09.99]This room's got dandruff?
[130:11.05]I don't have dandruff.
[130:13.11]You have dandruff.
[130:13.81]You're projecting that on me.
[130:16.04]Go wash your fucking hair.
[130:22.40]Toxic.
[130:29.36]No, and that's not me projecting.
[130:31.18]You projected on me.
[130:32.24]That does not mean I project back onto you.
[130:35.54]You just got that guy killed, by the way.
[130:37.60]You just got that guy killed.
[130:38.68]I hope you're happy.
[130:44.90]So when I have a little bit of danger sometimes, you got a problem with that?
[131:08.15]Now he's nervous.
[131:12.56]Oh no, they know!
[131:13.96]They know!
[131:14.46]They know that I have dandruff and what do I do?
[131:20.64]Use the flamethrower to burn your dandruff off.
[131:32.55]He just almost killed me in one hit.
[131:35.05]Guys.
[131:41.02]Dandruff is from not washing hair?
[131:43.52]No.
[131:43.82]Dandruff is like a scalp condition.
[131:47.42]You had it wrong.
[131:48.51]And you projected onto me and I had it wrong and I threw it back at you.
[131:52.27]You see what happened there?
[132:00.94]Get away from me.
[132:01.46]What's wrong with me?
[132:08.66]The cycle of hate continues.
[132:10.32]Yeah, get this egg!
[132:11.40]Get that cycle of hate out of here!
[132:16.78]Saying I can shoot this off, right?
[132:32.09]You just lied!
[132:33.17]You made it up!
[132:36.39]You made it up!
[132:50.57]Does that stop the door from closing though?
[132:52.68]I don't think that does.
[133:06.33]We hit a nerve.
[133:07.09]I don't have dandruff.
[133:08.99]I don't.
[133:10.37]If you do, don't fucking listen to these idiots.
[133:13.06]Okay?
[133:13.92]It's fine.
[133:15.46]Get a little medicated shampoo.
[133:17.58]You'll be alright.
[133:21.94]You crashing out again?
[133:23.52]I almost just walked in there.
[133:29.95]I'm afraid to do this.
[133:33.53]Oh.
[133:36.09]Oh.
[133:45.43]Let's go!
[133:51.11]Uh... What?
[133:53.19]Didn't have a key.
[134:07.58]Where's the key?
[134:19.36]Workmanship of its guild's exterior takes your breath away.
[134:21.60]A fitting tomb for those who made it.
[134:23.02]Is it not, like, behind this or something?
[134:42.94]Shit, did I miss a key?
[134:45.44]It's in the safe.
[134:48.97]Oh, he did talk about a safe.
[134:50.37]But where's that safe?
[134:52.67]Scanners.
[135:00.44]Did you even grab the key?
[135:03.60]Fucking god damn it!
[135:05.64]I didn't get the key?
[135:06.60]I'm saving it.
[135:21.59]This guy's a mess.
[135:23.59]You don't know anything about me.
[135:27.23]You get to see a four to six hour snippet of my life.
[135:53.99]I know, like, a couple things.
[135:59.50]Six hours too much?
[136:01.50]You're like a five-year sub.
[136:04.20]So, uh... What's up with that?
[136:06.52]Okay, so now I gotta go back this way and get the key.
[136:29.10]Mm-hmm.
[136:31.44]Why didn't Grandpa say anything about it?
[136:34.10]Oh, son, son, hold on.
[136:35.10]You forgot the reason why we opened the... Why?
[136:37.08]Well, he's already gone.
[136:39.99]No, what?
[136:45.91]Oh, yes!
[136:46.53]Fuck all these books.
[137:02.76]Am I going the wrong way?
[137:03.50]Yeah.
[137:08.35]I love how someone said, fuck homework.
[137:19.60]Oh man, screw homework.
[137:22.36]Oh no.
[137:34.25]Laugh my ass off, real.
[137:36.51]Oh, no.
[137:37.03]Oh, may as well save it again, because I'm gonna get crushed by the door.
[137:53.12]Can you sign my doctor's note?
[137:54.50]This is not a... This stream is not an excuse to not go to school.
[138:00.59]If you present this to your school or for a doctor or something, they're gonna be like, um, no.
[138:10.37]This stream is not a prescription, okay?
[138:18.25]Do your homework and watch the VODs.
[138:21.83]Get out of here.
[138:26.45]Get out of here!
[138:26.97]Get out of here!
[138:30.23]Don't put that on me.
[138:44.93]But only enough of you leave so I don't drop below 10,000 viewers.
[138:56.90]Oh my god, I thought I died again.
[139:10.14]Blood.
[139:23.49]This is a mature audience stream.
[139:24.81]Let me remind you again.
[139:25.61]I need to remind you to tap the sign so often.
[139:37.49]Playing a mature audience game.
[139:38.87]There's blood on the ground.
[139:52.10]An exam on Thursday?
[139:53.10]Okay, well this one's for you.
[139:59.16]Alright, if I... Wait, is that college?
[140:01.80]College exam?
[140:02.30]Okay.
[140:04.99]I'm in college, it's okay?
[140:05.77]Alright, so if you are going to get an A-plus on your exam and you're going to work really hard on it, you're going to do so good on it.
[140:12.93]If I get this guy right now.
[140:20.11]Ah!
[140:33.79]I want this person to get an A. I don't want to like fucking curse them.
[140:55.19]Enjoy the A.
[141:14.38]What's up with that?
[141:14.86]Why was I doing that?
[141:22.44]What the freaking heck?
[141:40.49]I don't want to waste all this shit here.
[141:42.07]Good job equipping it.
[141:51.45]Zero points of damage.
[142:04.42]What do these things even do?
[142:06.52]These guys drop them sometimes.
[142:09.48]Does this guy drop one?
[142:10.76]No.
[142:19.90]Hey, what if I get an F?
[142:22.71]Um... You're watching a live streamer play a 25 year old Resident Evil-like game.
[142:32.21]I got nothing to do with your grade in... Oh, dude.
[142:37.18]What the... Oh!
[142:42.38]Not even a few hours old and it's decaying.
[142:47.94]No way.
[142:56.52]Something in there?
[142:58.06]Something in there?
[143:03.95]Load the gun.
[143:06.65]That's twisted, man.
[143:07.57]I know.
[143:07.85]It's very twisted. ...
[143:23.99]I'm dead in one second.
[143:25.67]See ya.
[143:28.36]I couldn't even say it before it happened.
[143:30.24]I was going to say before he talked.
[143:32.00]Oi, mate.
[143:32.42]I'm going to be dead in one second.
[143:34.30]That was funny.
[143:50.57]I actually prefer using this.
[143:52.80]on these guys.
[143:54.29]It's better than the flamethrower.
[143:55.25]It's just... This game is about finding the right tool for the job.
[143:59.69]You know what I just realized?
[144:09.89]This game doesn't have a HUD.
[144:11.04]That's kind of cool.
[144:14.22]I'm realizing that right now.
[144:27.65]Nice.
[144:29.41]Very immersive.
[144:30.03]Well, I mean, the HUD comes up when you get hurt.
[144:34.36]Alert shareholder meeting in 10 minutes to discuss the future of today's stream and the Chrono Trigger situation.
[144:39.94]I forgot.
[144:41.68]Alright.
[144:41.96]Yep.
[144:42.22]I got it.
[144:42.54]I got it.
[144:42.84]Alright.
[144:49.31]The new collection key.
[145:04.86]Is this for the new collection?
[145:10.81]It is?
[145:11.03]Uh-oh.
[145:25.38]Dark in here.
[145:26.16]Oh.
[145:31.70]Did I just take the lamp out?
[145:38.19]It said, screw Chrono Trigger.
[145:39.55]This game is awesome.
[145:46.08]Hold on.
[145:47.06]Wait for the meeting.
[145:49.86]We got a meeting coming up.
[145:50.72]Hold on.
[145:52.88]There's a lot of them right now.
[145:54.86]I actually need to use this, I think.
[145:57.47]This room is the reason why you equipped this.
[146:22.87]Dead?
[146:57.59]I have ten of these.
[146:58.49]Are these mysterious objects here to possess a powerful charm?
[147:01.80]I have ten of them.
[147:07.10]Wait a second.
[147:08.46]Wait a minute.
[147:10.36]I have 200 bullets?
[147:16.06]I can shoot that gun 200 times?
[147:20.77]I... I thought... I thought I had four.
[147:26.61]Look at the top right!
[147:27.61]I thought I had lo- Oh shit, I only have four shots or six shots or something.
[147:33.39]Two hundred!
[147:36.51]I've been being so conservative with these.
[147:38.21]I can shoot the gun fucking more than a hundred times!
[147:52.17]You've gotta be kidding me.
[147:53.55]That's kind of insane.
[148:02.49]I can't fucking believe it.
[148:03.93]I'm gonna- Okay, use this way more.
[148:09.13]That's unbelievable.
[148:10.39]Alright, get over it.
[148:11.64]I'm alright.
[148:18.42]How many do I have now?
[148:23.81]It's like 20 bullets every time I've picked them up.
[148:31.71]Dude!
[148:39.90]There it is.
[148:40.24]The Eye of Isis.
[148:45.62]You found the notes on the new collection.
[148:47.29]Do you wish to take... Yeah, let's take a look.
[148:51.89]Isis was one of the earliest and most important goddesses in ancient Egypt.
[148:55.67]Revered as the bringer of nature's abundance, also known to be a great sorceress, legend has it that she imbued this statuette with her power in order to safeguard humanity from a deadly curse.
[149:07.16]However, far from affording protection, the statue is said to bring chaos and misfortune with it.
[149:14.18]Whilst an entertaining story, the recent history does indeed do little to dispel these superstitions, still held true by Egyptian sects.
[149:22.77]Having been uncovered in 1865 by the eminent archaeologist Dr. Stanley Dane, the Eye of Isis disappeared for many years.
[149:30.31]It was recently retrieved from the sunken wreck of the Glorious Scott, an English streamer which had disappeared with all hands lost on a routine trip from Egypt to Southampton.
[149:44.61]Legends aside, it is undeniably beautiful piece with a value beyond estimation and the pride of the Museum of Great Britain's new collection.
[149:53.62]Set.
[149:54.70]Set.
[149:55.47]brother of Osiris, was immortalized as the evil god of chaos and destruction.
[150:00.85]Legend describes many animal forms to Set, including a deadly serpent.
[150:05.55]Osiris, husband of Isis, who became god of the underworld, once a mighty god, myth tells how Osiris was cruelly murdered and later dismembered by his jealous brother Set.
[150:16.50]Helped by fellow conspirators, Omrah, Ramantuk, and Suteq.
[150:22.42]Through the efforts of his grieving wife, the scattered remains of Osiris were rescued, and he was resurrected to become god of the underworld and judge of the dead.
[150:31.74]The conspirators were captured and put to death for their crimes.
[150:34.26]However, it is said that with his dying gasp, the vengeful set uttered a terrible curse upon all of humanity.
[150:40.72]The statue of the seated Osiris was recovered from Karnak in 1835.
[150:54.96]Interesting.
[150:58.08]Abdul?
[151:01.88]Great to see you.
[151:03.30]Uh-oh.
[151:23.76]No, we can't lose Abdul.
[151:24.85]I've become completely attached to Abdul.
[151:25.97]Decorative wooden handle.
[151:26.65]Natural history area.
[151:59.56]Okay, so we have reached two hours and 30 minutes of the stream.
[152:04.02]I would like to take this moment to take a few minutes just to go over with everybody what the plan here is.
[152:11.22]Okay.
[152:12.18]Plan is Chrono Trigger.
[152:16.88]I would like to get a poll in the chat, please.
[152:20.18]So remember, this has to be more than 70%.
[152:26.27]Yes.
[152:28.99]And remember, my vote is worth 30%.
[152:33.15]Would you... How do you feel about playing... Would you like to move to Chrono Trigger in 30 minutes?
[152:45.72]This is move to Chrono Trigger after the next break in 30 minutes.
[153:02.83]Okay.
[153:06.29]I actually can't alt tab and click the thing, but what do we got?
[153:14.66]We are never going to see Chrono Trigger again.
[153:16.52]Yes, that's one of my favorite games of all time.
[153:18.24]I'm going to play.
[153:18.68]I'm going to finish it.
[153:19.22]It has to be over 70%.
[153:38.94]Where are we at?
[153:39.72]Let's see.
[153:42.66]72% said no.
[153:43.96]Okay.
[153:45.76]My vote is worth 10%.
[153:48.36]At least.
[153:53.22]I'm also going to vote no.
[154:00.08]No!
[154:01.16]No!
[154:02.10]Come on.
[154:29.64]We're still gonna play it tonight.
[154:31.88]That is a guarantee.
[154:38.27]I'll give you a 100% guarantee.
[154:43.71]We are going to play Chrono Trigger tonight.
[154:45.67]That is a 100% guarantee.
[154:48.79]In fact, I'll give you a 102% chance.
[154:50.05]It's up.
[155:11.39]Stop!
[155:20.34]Who cares?
[155:20.70]I can shoot this thing a hundred times!
[155:21.94]Well, apparently it takes a hundred shots to kill anything, so...
[155:49.30]No!
[156:00.66]Helps to hit them though.
[156:03.54]That's the whole point of a shotgun.
[156:05.36]We don't matter.
[156:06.04]Wait, didn't I get a key?
[156:19.05]Wait a minute.
[156:24.63]Do I already have the natural history place open?
[156:27.06]This is the disease and medicine exhibit.
[156:32.30]I guess I have to put that into something?
[156:33.46]Is this a secret passage I have to unveil?
[156:38.89]Okay, bros.
[156:41.39]Any scanners?
[157:03.85]I don't think it's this way.
[157:04.61]Hmm, it might be.
[157:08.11]Across the staircase?
[157:11.05]Let me try across the staircase.
[157:30.33]Yeah.
[157:34.69]Shit.
[157:46.70]I need a little... Where's a place I could... What's this?
[157:52.32]Abdul gave you this.
[157:53.10]Use it to reveal a secret passage beyond the natural history exhibition.
[157:56.34]I think I already have that place open and unlocked.
[157:58.44]I just don't know where it is.
[158:06.87]You have 180 bolts.
[158:08.05]Just shoot the doorknob off.
[158:10.80]Yeah, I could seriously turn around and shoot every part of wood of this door and still have like 100 bolts left.
[158:19.22]Go back to Abdul so I can help you.
[158:20.46]The walkthrough only gives archaic directions.
[158:22.62]It's so funny.
[158:27.97]You have the walkthrough open and you don't even know where I should go.
[158:31.95]I love that.
[158:33.37]That's wonderful.
[158:38.00]Not here.
[158:43.23]There's got to be like a statue or something I can put this in.
[158:48.11]I don't know.
[158:49.67]I'm trying my best.
[158:53.51]I appreciate it.
[158:54.45]Don't worry.
[159:00.62]Where's the natural history area?
[159:02.68]I wish there were more signs.
[159:12.17]This fucking walkthrough is in hieroglyphics.
[159:14.67]Well, excuse me, don't use the f-word.
[159:17.51]You could say this walkthrough is in hieroglyphics.
[159:27.50]This is the torture exhibit.
[159:35.50]You're in the atrium.
[159:36.14]Look at the map and look left.
[159:38.35]I'm in the atrium right now.
[159:46.32]Go back up the stairs?
[160:02.43]Like up here?
[160:06.35]That top left door right there?
[160:07.53]Huh?
[160:14.67]Yes!
[160:17.37]Yes!
[160:17.89]Okay, so there's apparently something up here.
[160:45.11]I'm coming to help!
[160:45.65]I'm coming!
[160:46.47]I'm coming!
[160:46.83]I'm coming!
[160:49.93]Watch out!
[160:53.23]Alright, they both had heart attacks.
[161:06.00]Wait, the goons seem to be looking for something or someone.
[161:18.15]Ooh, okay.
[161:20.57]Oh, it's one of those bug museum things.
[161:26.53]How many canisters?
[161:27.19]Is this empty?
[161:30.35]How can I tell if it's empty or not?
[161:33.14]Oh, here it is.
[161:39.46]Two full canisters, and then this wooden handle.
[161:45.70]He's saying goon, he's saying goon.
[162:10.65]What the hell is that?
[162:11.33]That sounds like a gun.
[162:38.73]I thought it was the bear.
[162:39.59]Oh, they got me.
[162:42.87]Oh fuck, that actually might come alive.
[162:44.30]Is the bear gonna come alive?
[162:51.32]You don't put a glass case like this here without the bear coming out and attacking me.
[162:59.86]Or that one.
[163:00.41]That one's gonna start crawling around.
[163:01.65]It's gonna be weird.
[163:02.39]That's a bear.
[163:09.92]What the fuck was that?
[163:14.66]It's empty.
[163:22.72]That shit's empty.
[163:23.90]That... Okay, you show me bear over there in case.
[163:26.86]Empty case.
[163:27.70]That bear is loose.
[163:41.43]It's gonna come out of here.
[163:45.95]Who went... It's gonna break out of the glass.
[163:49.53]Can I push it?
[164:16.58]This dude's weak.
[164:25.42]What the fuck's going on?
[164:26.62]What's going on?
[164:27.26]I told you the bear's gonna come alive.
[164:29.02]I told you the bear's gonna come alive.
[164:33.54]It's doing the weird, uh, like, Egyptian magic to him, and he's gonna turn into a- he's gonna turn into a bear.
[164:50.28]I knew it!
[164:50.88]I told you!
[164:56.08]Oh shit.
[164:59.86]What the fuck?
[165:02.20]Wait, could I have another bear help me?
[165:05.66]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[165:13.64]Bullets.
[165:21.25]Hold on, hold on.
[165:22.11]I think he's confused.
[165:23.11]He's confused, he's confused.
[165:49.11]Let's go.
[165:50.69]It's torch time.
[165:57.60]DIE!
[166:18.69]Why is he bleeding that much?
[166:20.13]He's bleeding everywhere.
[166:21.34]I don't like this.
[166:27.32]Look at all this blood coming out of him.
[166:36.56]He is a blood fountain.
[166:37.96]How much blood does he have?
[166:57.76]I have no more bullets in this thing Please die
[167:37.80]Ow!
[167:38.80]I got no... Wait, are these dead?
[167:41.42]I think he died.
[167:43.70]That was not a death animation.
[167:44.64]Never mind.
[167:46.22]Um... That kind of looks like a mascot suit.
[168:06.84]Okay, how do I kill this thing?
[168:17.36]Just don't move anymore, Sammy.
[168:20.99]Okay, I got a minute to think here.
[168:31.22]Okay.
[168:32.38]When I turn this corner, I'm going to turn and shoot him in the head.
[168:57.38]I think I have 200 bullets I don't think this thing can be killed
[169:44.76]He's dead?
[169:45.10]He's just out of breath.
[169:48.56]You good?
[170:02.29]I'm just shooting him in the head over and over again.
[170:13.49]This is a battle of wits?
[170:14.53]What do you mean a battle of wits?
[170:15.85]There's no way I have to... He's not killable!
[170:38.84]Oh shit!
[171:04.32]Fight it with a knife?
[171:06.50]Shoot it in the belly?
[171:07.58]Do I have to shoot it in the stomach?
[171:12.64]Did I just waste a hundred bullets?
[171:16.26]Oh my god.
[171:17.04]Look at the indicator.
[171:30.79]Do it.
[171:31.99]Let me see.
[171:37.06]shoot it once can I reload the save can I I've burnt him there's another bear there's another bear this too can I reload the save let me reload the save is that bad is that cheesing I wasted every single item I had guys
[172:05.58]Let me reload the safe.
[172:22.35]Okay.
[172:23.79]Wait, is he eating me?
[172:25.67]What is going on?
[172:33.13]What the fuck was that?
[172:35.61]What the hell was that?
[172:42.12]Thumbnail?
[172:54.94]Okay
[172:57.93]Well, I kind of remember where that was.
[173:02.19]Back to the atrium.
[173:02.95]Abdomenist T posing.
[173:18.21]Okay, alright.
[173:19.27]Where is this?
[173:20.39]Where is this place, everybody?
[173:21.91]Please, where are my scanners?
[173:24.87]Wrong way, wrong way.
[173:26.10]I gotta...
[173:29.32]Am I going backwards?
[173:33.97]Get serious.
[173:34.83]I'm serious.
[173:35.49]How do you feel about the Minecraft movie?
[173:38.59]I don't know, dude.
[173:39.69]I don't give a shit.
[173:41.95]I'm sure it's fun.
[173:44.45]Jack Black is gonna... Jack Black is gonna go... Like, it's gonna be fucking funny.
[173:50.99]Kids are gonna love it.
[173:52.49]Who cares?
[173:55.53]Did your little brother think it was fun?
[173:57.19]Good.
[173:57.47]Who cares?
[174:14.56]Do you really need a 39-year-old man's perspective on what I think about the Minecraft movie?
[174:21.02]I'm sure it's wonderful.
[174:22.54]I'm sure the kids are going to love it, and you're going to take the kids there, and it's going to be like, zombie, look out.
[174:30.48]And you know what?
[174:31.34]Good.
[174:32.62]Let your little brother have something fun, okay?
[174:35.02]Let him have this.
[174:36.32]Are you going to go to the Minecraft movie and be like, hey, stupid, this movie sucks, you know?
[174:41.01]It's got like 40% of rotten tomatoes.
[174:44.34]Your little brother doesn't know what Rotten Tomatoes is.
[174:46.24]He knows what a dirt house is.
[174:48.99]Leave him alone.
[174:49.61]Let him enjoy it.
[174:50.24]Who cares?
[175:26.78]He's advocating for shit movies.
[175:33.07]You're making me sick with this.
[175:34.11]I don't want to give any... I don't want to give any takes about any more Minecraft movie takes.
[175:44.37]I went the wrong way.
[175:49.94]Dude, Jack Black sips a cider at one point in the movie.
[175:52.94]That would be so funny.
[175:58.33]And he's like, oh, that's some good cider.
[176:07.66]Some of you guys are way, way overestimating the relevancy that I have in that world, okay?
[176:14.83]It is like a 2 out of 100.
[176:16.49]It's 2 out of 100.
[176:18.33]It might even be a 1 out of 100.
[176:21.55]You are way overestimating how much anybody cares about any of that that I ever did.
[176:32.33]Oh, man.
[176:32.77]It was so funny.
[176:33.99]Okay.
[176:35.03]I forgot everything.
[176:35.94]Where am I going?
[176:44.16]I need to go to the atrium.
[176:47.58]Up the stairs to the atrium.
[176:50.97]Where's the atrium?
[176:52.89]Right.
[176:53.49]Oh, I know where to go.
[176:54.27]Look.
[177:04.84]Ego Andy thinks he invented sipping Minecraft cider.
[177:08.46]No, I'm telling you that I am so irrelevant.
[177:11.92]I'm very irrelevant in that world.
[177:15.38]That there's no... No, you're just being weird.
[177:18.81]You're gaslighting me.
[177:22.31]Wait, isn't that this door?
[177:26.41]Oh, opposite side.
[177:34.38]It's easy to do that.
[177:37.30]We're just having fun here, okay?
[177:39.38]We're just having fun.
[177:50.93]I want a movie to come out that
[177:55.28]In the credits of the movie, it says written, directed, and starring Jeremy Elbertson.
[178:01.30]But I didn't do anything.
[178:02.92]I had nothing to do with the movie at all.
[178:04.78]I'm not in it.
[178:05.56]I didn't write it.
[178:06.26]I wasn't even on set for one day.
[178:10.39]Like, I Uber Eats-ed an order for the crew one afternoon.
[178:16.43]That's all I did.
[178:26.31]Oi, look out, mate!
[178:27.91]Don't breathe it!
[178:28.63]Don't!
[178:29.97]Stop!
[178:31.95]I should have told you earlier.
[178:36.27]I can do that for my final project.
[178:37.85]No, no, I'm talking about like a... No, not your movie.
[178:40.45]I don't want you to do that for fucking some movie you made.
[178:42.99]I'm sorry.
[178:47.64]I'm sorry.
[178:53.30]I'm on like the warpath right now.
[179:02.83]How do I... There we go.
[179:09.44]No, when I say your, I mean collectively everybody.
[179:12.38]I don't mean that you in particular.
[179:18.30]Remember, we're in a stadium full of animals throwing rocks at me, okay?
[179:24.06]I'm talking of all of you.
[179:25.10]Alright, don't... Make sure I don't mess this up.
[179:46.69]Scared me again, and I didn't even do anything.
[179:51.25]See?
[179:51.49]We need to calm the chat down?
[179:55.30]Alright.
[179:56.08]Alright, alright, alright.
[179:58.50]Everybody shut up.
[180:00.18]Relax.
[180:02.26]Just chill out.
[180:03.46]Everybody chill out.
[180:04.36]Everybody chill out.
[180:05.30]Let's chill out.
[180:06.98]Let's take it down a notch.
[180:10.20]You need to hop on the damage control?
[180:11.54]Okay.
[180:13.60]Take it down.
[180:16.74]Stop typing.
[180:17.73]I'm seeing way too many messages coming up.
[180:20.13]There's way too many messages.
[180:22.29]Stop typing.
[180:23.45]Put your hands up behind your head and like put lay like lean back in your chair and go hands up like over behind your head and like lean back and stretch your back out and relax.
[180:40.82]Okay.
[180:41.94]We good?
[180:42.76]You good?
[180:43.46]Chill out.
[180:47.25]Okay.
[180:49.57]We had our fun.
[180:50.34]We had a fun time.
[180:51.50]Now I'm gonna get attacked by the bear and we're all gonna chill out.
[181:00.38]Okay.
[181:01.22]We're good.
[181:02.40]Relax.
[181:21.90]Alright.
[181:24.00]Shoot it in the stomach three times and save all the ammo.
[181:30.78]I didn't... I thought he was going to say, what a tarnation.
[181:39.26]That's his one.
[181:40.46]That's his three.
[181:41.00]I need... I want him... He needs to do his two.
[181:44.94]That's his one.
[181:46.66]Do your two.
[181:49.70]This is auto attack.
[181:51.12]This is one.
[181:53.63]This is three.
[181:54.13]He's not using his two.
[181:56.47]Okay.
[181:58.59]Oh, fuck.
[182:02.37]Good.
[182:02.65]Good.
[182:28.50]I'm gonna die.
[182:59.28]Stand up!
[183:03.54]I got a break coming up in one minute.
[183:05.10]I need to kill you before then.
[183:06.10]Oh my god.
[183:10.68]Got him!
[183:27.89]Yeah!
[183:37.58]Okay, good.
[183:38.04]Snooze.
[183:39.46]I was gonna say, I kinda like it.
[183:42.68]We're laughing.
[183:43.40]I'm gonna die.
[184:01.50]Come on.
[184:01.94]Do it.
[184:03.04]Do it!
[184:06.40]Do it!
[184:10.88]Do it!
[184:19.83]Why is he not doing it?
[184:38.84]I think you could kill a bear in real life.
[184:41.86]Um... Hold on.
[184:47.01]Okay, got it.
[184:50.05]There's another one.
[184:56.67]Uh, what do I have for stuff?
[185:01.17]Do I get to wear a... Do I get to wear, like, a full suit of armor?
[185:06.96]Can I wear that, like, bear thing that that guy does where he throws himself down the cliff a bunch of times?
[185:21.17]I'm running out of heals.
[185:22.77]This is actually kind of bad.
[185:24.25]This is really bad, actually.
[185:25.79]Alright, lock in.
[185:26.57]For real.
[185:57.07]I'm completely in the zone right now.
[186:10.72]Damn it.
[186:12.36]Still got it off.
[186:32.43]Come on!
[186:39.85]Keep strafing.
[186:41.74]Strafe.
[186:44.88]Strafe.
[186:46.98]Strafe.
[186:51.54]One more shot and I'm good.
[186:58.11]You piece of shit!
[187:14.84]You're still... No, you're dead.
[187:16.06]He's dead.
[187:16.28]He's dead.
[187:17.28]Oh, thank God.
[187:18.46]Okay.
[187:19.84]Uh, I'm gonna die.
[187:25.95]I need... I need health.
[187:30.65]I'm gonna... You searched the body.
[187:32.07]Nothing useful.
[187:32.73]I'm gonna... I'm gonna tick to death.
[187:38.17]I gotta hurry up and do this, like, right now.
[187:42.33]Oh, my God.
[187:42.75]Thank God for Abdul.
[187:45.30]Alright, I got a break coming up in a minute.
[187:51.74]Who is making that noise?
[187:56.38]I'm afraid to save it because I might have lost everything.
[188:01.65]Oh, Abdul, you are absolutely the best thing in the world.
[188:06.89]Oh my goodness, you're amazing.
[188:09.36]You saved the whole run.
[188:13.02]Actually, run completely saved from Abdul.
[188:18.25]Just in case, though.
[188:20.29]Alright.
[188:21.44]I'm going to take a break.
[188:22.06]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[188:24.08]See you guys in three to four minutes.
[188:26.92]Ads are going to play.
[188:27.66]You know the deal.
[188:30.06]See you soon.
[192:32.23]How you doing?
[192:39.29]Being a one guy is a higher rank than having him read a message.
[192:43.04]See, that's where the mentality gets a little messed up for me.
[192:49.46]I told you this before.
[192:51.02]Everyone wants to be a one guy.
[192:52.84]There is no more one guy.
[192:53.84]Unfortunate.
[192:56.05]Unfortunate.
[193:17.15]OK, we good.
[193:22.97]I am ready to keep rolling so.
[193:26.91]I'm actually at a point in the game where.
[193:29.91]Resources have gotten scarce and that's not good.
[193:33.50]I think I can move this right?
[193:39.36]No, that looks like the wall back there can some of the wall.
[194:04.18]Loot the bears?
[194:06.64]Didn't I already try?
[194:07.23]Oh, wait.
[194:07.65]Check behind the first case.
[194:09.51]Ah!
[194:12.07]Stop making that noise!
[194:13.35]Is this one...?
[194:21.54]There's probably something behind the painting.
[194:23.50]No?
[194:35.28]Nothing.
[194:46.84]Oh, what?
[195:00.61]Oh, yep.
[195:01.23]300 bullets.
[195:05.56]Some menthol.
[195:10.20]Passage contains into darkness into the other side of this lock gate.
[195:13.16]Perhaps there's another way through.
[195:14.28]Yeah.
[195:14.64]How many bullets do I have?
[195:20.37]Oh, not a big deal.
[195:20.99]Just, you know, 236.
[195:22.13]I've shot the gun like 500 times since it was 200.
[195:31.57]I need a heal though.
[195:32.49]I need salts.
[195:41.72]Shut up.
[195:43.86]Actually, let's just do this again.
[195:47.20]Oops!
[195:48.52]Whatever.
[195:48.98]I gotta live with it.
[196:06.03]Okay.
[196:09.09]We got it loaded up, right?
[196:14.78]I don't like this hallway.
[196:27.15]What the?
[196:28.39]Victoria?
[196:29.85]Is that you?
[196:31.66]That was an anime gasp.
[196:34.04]I was told where to find you by someone called Abdul Wahid.
[196:38.00]He seems to be some kind of government official.
[196:40.91]I met him earlier, but I last saw him around the time the police started arriving.
[196:44.92]Oh, Darian, it's been terrifying.
[196:47.42]You've no idea.
[196:48.32]Believe me, I've seen some things tonight that I simply can't explain.
[196:52.57]It's affecting everything.
[196:54.35]Once or twice, I've come too close, and it's made me feel nauseous.
[196:58.66]It's disgusting.
[196:59.12]I breathed in the gas too much.
[197:20.82]I got it.
[197:21.20]I'm not giving you my gun.
[197:52.93]Not give gun.
[197:54.93]Right between the eyes.
[197:55.81]I don't think I can give her anything.
[198:09.00]Alright, so we're gonna go back to the clock.
[198:11.32]Back to the safe in the library.
[198:13.94]Which... Good luck knowing with that.
[198:17.69]Good luck.
[198:18.03]I need some scanners to help me with that one.
[198:30.02]Should I just sprint down this hallway?
[198:36.14]Think I can make it?
[198:47.65]Too risky.
[198:48.05]I have no health.
[198:48.49]I have no heals.
[198:58.14]I still don't know what these do.
[199:13.18]Alright, here we go.
[199:14.40]It's down from here, right?
[199:17.47]In the library.
[199:36.57]Where is it right?
[199:37.31]What the fuck?
[199:41.27]What the fuck?
[199:48.04]Was it a trap?
[199:48.82]Why did he put it?
[199:49.38]He like dragged it over here.
[200:05.18]How did I miss?
[200:09.62]Okay.
[200:11.92]You know what?
[200:12.42]Fuck both of you.
[200:20.71]He's shooting the stairs!
[200:35.46]Come on!
[200:43.22]I guess I can't do it either.
[200:51.22]You shoot yours first.
[200:54.86]Alright, here's the safe.
[201:05.73]Locked.
[201:07.31]Combination of the safe is...
[201:14.63]This, right here.
[201:16.57]Boom.
[201:17.41]13 left, 2 right, 6 right.
[201:20.81]We put this on.
[201:23.56]To open it.
[201:26.56]Wait, no, this... Never mind, we gotta go to the clock.
[201:33.19]Where is the clock?
[201:34.55]Right there.
[201:34.99]Thank you!
[201:44.36]Small crack in the case.
[201:47.97]Torn scrap of paper.
[201:48.95]7 right, 4 left, 6 left.
[201:55.77]Wait, I have to combine this.
[201:58.81]With this.
[202:06.61]Wait, what is F3 on the controller?
[202:08.92]I just did it.
[202:09.86]Okay.
[202:15.17]Bounce forever.
[202:15.61]The full combination to the safe.
[202:18.97]13 left, 2 right, 6 right, 7 right, 4 left, 6 left.
[202:22.48]That's all I want to see in the chat right now.
[202:23.92]I'm not kidding.
[202:42.47]Okay, how do I use it?
[202:53.14]How do I do the combination?
[202:54.28]Yeah, I know it's locked.
[203:07.09]How come I can't go down there?
[203:24.45]Use the paper on it?
[203:25.23]That's what I just tried to do.
[203:27.85]Use, like, use it.
[203:33.10]Is it a different safe?
[203:34.36]That would be crazy.
[203:36.28]If it was a different safe.
[203:40.98]Safe in the library.
[203:42.20]That's a safe in the, it's not the, wait, it's the one that's underneath the stairwell.
[203:48.41]Where is that one?
[203:49.73]There's one that's underneath the stairwell somewhere.
[203:53.32]Yeah, right, where's that?
[203:56.46]It's in a weird hallway.
[203:57.34]I think it's right here.
[204:11.87]Is it here?
[204:12.31]At the state under the stairs, isn't it like around here somewhere?
[204:28.83]The hamster is 45 minutes ahead of you now.
[204:34.46]I just walked past it?
[204:38.48]What?
[204:51.57]Hold on, let me look at the map.
[204:52.37]Because it's...
[204:54.63]I don't know.
[204:55.09]It's been like five hours since we've been over there.
[204:59.65]Anybody know where that is?
[205:00.51]Yeah, like back seating right now, I'm literally pulling the steering wheel off in the driver's seat and just going back and handing it back to you and going, here, you take it for a minute.
[205:26.77]Maybe the map need to scan the map for a second.
[205:30.79]Is a stairwell over there, but no, hold on.
[205:36.21]This way.
[205:41.92]Under here.
[205:52.28]No shit.
[206:02.27]I don't know where it is.
[206:06.60]I wish I could move the map.
[206:16.56]It's not this one.
[206:17.62]There's another safe.
[206:19.48]Weirdly, the walls were white.
[206:21.14]Remember, the walls were white.
[206:27.20]Pause right here.
[206:29.66]Alright, I'm gonna show the menu.
[206:31.84]This is where I am right now.
[206:44.13]This is not a good map.
[206:45.87]It's not a very detailed map.
[206:51.29]Oh shit.
[206:53.51]Longplay goes back up the hall with the girl and then goes out into a hallway.
[207:09.84]Because we came out from... where?
[207:12.26]Over here?
[207:15.08]We came out of the bookcase.
[207:15.96]Okay, yeah, we came out of here.
[207:22.90]This is the hallway that... where the girl is.
[207:26.56]Is the... I can go the other way.
[207:27.84]And just tank the damage and see if we see what's over there.
[207:45.22]I was like, VRJosh is in the passenger side.
[207:49.26]Got it.
[207:50.00]VRJosh, collapse in the chat, please.
[208:02.29]Just power it up to do that.
[208:13.67]No, I don't want to get poisoned!
[208:25.72]Load the fucking gun!
[208:33.94]Any more?
[208:36.96]Yep.
[208:38.94]Who is it?
[208:39.32]What is that?
[208:49.89]Oh, these things are gonna be weird.
[208:50.95]They're gonna... These things are gonna come alive?
[208:56.33]Jesus.
[208:56.47]Huh?
[209:22.11]How do I just... I don't want... How do I get rid... Why do I have these crossbow bolts?
[209:25.71]How do I get rid of these?
[209:39.15]You need to use them?
[209:44.21]Well, I guess I can heal.
[209:46.41]That's the amount of... That's pretty much the amount I can use to heal.
[209:50.96]It's like about 40% of your health bar.
[209:52.58]So, okay.
[209:54.80]And I'll pick this up.
[210:06.11]He's in full.
[210:08.83]Abdul can hold stuff.
[210:10.21]Oh, okay.
[210:25.51]Actually, go back to the safe and use the code paper on it to open it, apparently, as well.
[210:31.36]Was that the right safe?
[210:35.26]So I guess it was the right safe.
[210:36.44]What, it's just not in the right spot?
[210:49.45]I was at every angle.
[210:50.53]Alright, well, I got some more stuff.
[210:51.93]I'm good.
[210:59.19]That's poisonous.
[211:00.19]I'm not going to mess with that.
[211:01.09]Alright.
[211:01.29]Let me actually go see if I can do it.
[211:04.64]It's a find the pixel type game.
[211:06.00]Okay.
[211:06.88]Alright.
[211:07.12]Alright.
[211:07.40]Cool.
[211:12.31]Well, at least I know I remember that for the next time.
[211:15.27]Can I move that?
[211:18.23]Looks like I can move this.
[211:34.44]Down.
[212:25.05]Where the heck is it?
[212:37.36]It's right here somewhere, right here.
[212:43.03]Alright, let's try it.
[212:43.77]Here's the locked items, documents, safe combination.
[212:58.54]locked okay use oh dear okay I just had to be in the right spot and press the right button don't breathe that devil I wasn't that far away
[213:32.68]What's going on?
[213:33.50]No!
[213:38.12]Did I lose?
[213:53.63]That would be so bad to hear.
[213:58.89]Imagine hearing the person that's supposed to save you.
[214:02.95]Oh shit, I'm playing as another character now.
[214:05.35]Why did I give her the gun?
[214:06.43]Remember she was like, oh, you know, I can use a gun, you know, and I'm like, yeah, fuck you.
[214:09.90]I should have given her the shotgun.
[214:13.56]Oh my god, that sucks.
[214:20.09]Oh no, that's actually terrible.
[214:26.45]She even said it, you know, I could use a gun.
[214:30.82]Like, sure, you're okay.
[214:32.14]I'm the one with the gun.
[214:36.80]Wait, should I... What's in his inventory?
[214:38.98]Alright.
[214:56.69]Okay, Abdul has a stick.
[215:00.68]Thank you, Abdul.
[215:03.92]Alright, let's go.
[215:04.54]I can't believe I played as another character.
[215:08.62]Yeah, but what I was going to say is if you hear that, you hear somebody's, and you can hear that from that far away.
[215:15.61]Why didn't I just go with him?
[215:19.99]I should have just gone with him.
[215:40.59]Medical notes.
[215:44.87]It's four years since that wretched expedition.
[215:47.26]Four years in which I have struggled to find a cure to the madness which hinders my work.
[215:53.17]But, as with all, Isis provides the answers.
[215:56.47]As he introduced medicine to the world, she'll provide an answer now.
[216:00.63]It is fruitless to try and convince the barbarians in this hellish hospital of its worth.
[216:07.31]Their methods in this age of science sicken me further.
[216:10.67]And still they claim it is I who is mad.
[216:12.53]Without their assistance, I fear I will never know for sure whether my theory is correct.
[216:18.19]Yet in my heart I know it is.
[216:20.55]Isis's power was such that she affected all around her.
[216:24.20]All the evidence showed that she was the architect of that accursed tomb, and I believe that she imbued it with her power.
[216:31.91]The very soil of that accursed place may contain enough of her spirit to cure those afflicted, or at least reverse its effects until the evil has been banished forever.
[216:40.99]Yes, it must be the answer.
[216:43.80]If I could get at my possessions, I could perhaps recover some of the soil in which they were packed.
[216:49.55]I shall request of Abdul that he bring some to me.
[216:51.63]April 7th.
[216:57.13]That's today.
[216:58.57]Wait, no, it was April 5th?
[217:00.79]Oh, never mind.
[217:02.27]As ever, Abdul has proven himself a loyal friend.
[217:04.61]He has retrieved from me a small sample of the soil we used to protect the artifacts during their journey.
[217:09.96]Soil taken from the very place where Isis once summoned her powers.
[217:14.10]I had to take every precaution to conceal it from the staff here at the asylum.
[217:19.08]Their insistence that I keep none of my equipment meant I had to wait until I could use a wooden spoon, and the bowl in which my evening gruel was delivered to grind the rough soil into something a little more palatable.
[217:31.82]Mixing with water created a foul concoction, yet I am no doubt in my mind that my gamble has been successful.
[217:38.78]Oh my god.
[217:38.98]Okay, well that was what the water was for.
[217:40.60]Artifact pot.
[218:06.89]And you've found the disease and medical exhibition key.
[218:11.19]Alright, I remember seeing that before.
[218:17.03]Scanners?
[218:18.76]Where was the medical wing?
[218:33.61]It's been a long time.
[218:34.91]I don't know.
[218:45.60]Downstairs?
[218:46.56]You didn't say please?
[218:50.12]No, I commanded it, actually.
[218:52.54]You should be responding to my commands!
[219:00.75]Darian!
[219:02.03]Wake up!
[219:03.49]Darian!
[219:07.92]I know you can hear me.
[219:09.74]I must go and get help.
[219:11.72]Be strong, Darian.
[219:12.93]He actually kind of looks like he's... That looks like I'm fake asleep.
[219:17.59]I think maybe it kind of knocked him down.
[219:19.41]He was like, oh shit, I'm lying here.
[219:21.07]And he kind of heard that there was some commotion and that she's down here.
[219:23.40]And he's like, oh shit, wait a minute.
[219:25.98]I can rest for half an hour?
[219:27.14]I'm going to keep my eyes closed.
[219:29.36]I think she can handle it.
[219:43.15]Okay, he's got nothing on him.
[219:45.21]Alright, um... Is it this way?
[219:52.60]No, the torture exhibition.
[219:53.94]We're not going that way.
[220:00.94]I just hit him.
[220:01.92]That'd have made a blood sound.
[220:02.98]Shit, that made a... That made a crunchy sound, like I hit him in the stomach.
[220:14.65]Alright, medical facility, medical facility, medical facility.
[220:20.78]It is going to be pick random red doors on the map is what it's really going to come down to.
[220:24.68]Uh.
[220:33.11]Oh please.
[220:36.51]Really?
[220:44.12]weird statues got it in this door oh nice it's I I love this is great somebody said it earlier it's just up I got I got my mods are here then they're they're putting in like screenshots
[221:08.09]And, like, Josh is, like, watching the playthrough.
[221:10.07]It's people like, they need all the help for this geriatric guy to beat this fucking 30-year-old game.
[221:20.63]What's that?
[221:21.27]Oh, it's that way.
[221:24.57]No, no, can you take a screenshot?
[221:25.65]Can you take a picture of it?
[221:27.70]It's like, you want me to take a picture of my phone and send you the picture of my screenshot of my phone?
[221:34.32]Yeah, I need you to send me a picture of it.
[222:04.03]What do you rate the outfit?
[222:05.05]This is like an 8.
[222:10.27]I think this is like an 8.4.
[222:11.21]Alright.
[222:26.50]Which one of these doors does it?
[222:27.38]I think it's the one behind me.
[222:32.46]I really do miss the flamethrower now that there's these... This is gonna be scary.
[222:38.26]I'm not prepared for this at all.
[222:49.06]Oh boy.
[222:50.00]What is this?
[222:51.68]Ugh!
[222:53.68]It says half man, half toad.
[223:00.32]Why is it still screaming?
[223:10.33]Good, menthol.
[223:10.91]Encrusted with ancient blood.
[223:20.64]Something's going to pop out here in a second, I know it.
[223:34.17]I do have the best item in the game equipped, though, so it's... Oh, I wasn't faking it.
[223:42.83]That's gonna fall.
[223:44.79]That is... That is gonna fall.
[223:48.97]Right?
[223:59.98]Really?
[224:00.36]I didn't say I crush up the stuff.
[224:02.78]Like, I go like this and do that.
[224:05.44]And now I've got fine powder.
[224:06.68]I mix it with water.
[224:10.86]Where do I get the water now?
[224:12.74]He has the water on him.
[224:13.62]Alright, activate the trapdoor so I can just fall already.
[224:26.04]Ancient Fentanyl?
[224:28.54]Okay, dude.
[224:49.02]So I think I just bring this back and just like put it in his, is it, I have to mix it with the, he has the water bucket.
[225:05.87]Alright.
[225:08.24]Can we get a poll?
[225:09.92]Do we hear another Darien scream before I get down the stairs?
[225:24.62]Does it happen again?
[225:25.80]Or is that the only two that you're gonna hear?
[225:29.14]Like, before I get to, you know, to where he is, like, downstairs.
[225:37.81]Poll or bet?
[225:38.59]Yeah, make it a bet.
[225:39.69]Make it a bet.
[225:40.11]Let's have the chat have to put their money where their mouth is here.
[225:43.94]The bet will be, do we hear another Darian loud scream?
[225:48.68]Um... Before I get to his body.
[225:52.64]I get to his... I have to get to his body.
[225:56.18]After getting near his body, if there's a cutscene, that doesn't count.
[225:59.20]It's before getting to the body, to the room where his body is in.
[226:12.72]And remember, it's not after we find him.
[226:14.69]It's, are we going to hear it again?
[226:20.31]Before getting to his body.
[226:28.09]People can just look at the walkthrough.
[226:30.83]Don't fucking do that, okay?
[226:32.69]Don't do that.
[226:36.61]Alright, close the bet.
[226:37.49]Close the bet.
[226:38.23]Close it.
[226:38.51]Close it quick.
[226:39.81]Close it.
[226:40.45]If you didn't bet, sorry.
[226:41.51]Too late.
[226:47.84]Yeah.
[226:48.82]That's the amount of time it took me to open the YouTube video.
[226:51.02]Scan to the playthrough part.
[226:54.44]Close it up.
[226:59.36]Why do I think that I'm the only person with the internet?
[227:03.12]I'm apparently the only person with an internet connection.
[227:09.11]Well, okay, let's go.
[227:10.03]Does it happen?
[227:35.97]Hmm?
[227:42.69]Hmm, maybe?
[228:11.20]I thought for a second, I was like, why can she not go down the ladder?
[228:13.24]Okay, here we go.
[228:21.74]Almost there.
[228:22.30]Stop changing the camera.
[228:32.03]It keeps fucking with my head.
[228:36.03]Where is he?
[228:43.69]He did not scream.
[229:08.85]What?
[229:09.09]I could have gone in the inventory and taken all this stuff?
[229:24.93]Should I take all of his... Okay, I don't know.
[229:26.78]What if I... Do I wake him up and does he just... Let me take this.
[229:29.94]I don't even have the crossbow.
[229:35.88]What if I wake him up and he... I don't want to take everything because then what if it's like, oh, now it's... Are you going to play with Darian now?
[229:42.67]Alright, there it is.
[230:03.27]I don't want to access this inventory.
[230:04.89]I'm trying to go to my inventory.
[230:08.05]No!
[230:08.45]Stop accessing!
[230:09.15]I want to go to my inventory!
[230:13.51]No!
[230:14.92]I can't open up my inventory!
[230:18.70]Okay, how do I use it on him?
[230:30.13]Oh.
[230:31.37]Here we go.
[230:33.86]What the fuck are you talking about?
[230:35.06]Come on.
[230:40.49]I'm trying to use it!
[230:41.23]There's a dude on his head?
[231:38.52]Wait, so a mob just said... Wait, Dr. Clay, what'd you say?
[231:42.35]Did he leave the room?
[231:43.65]We have to... There's supposed to be a cutscene in the medical wing.
[232:01.46]Oh, because I didn't have the water.
[232:07.36]I'm taking a gun.
[232:12.40]I'm taking the shotgun and I'm taking all the bullets.
[232:15.08]I'm taking all 200 bullets.
[232:24.61]Before I leave this place, is there any requests for any songs?
[232:44.30]Uh... Pump up the jam?
[232:53.75]What the fuck?
[233:10.42]Uh...
[233:24.68]It's just a nightmare.
[233:25.82]It's just a dream.
[233:31.39]Oh no.
[233:36.01]What an idiot.
[233:37.61]Miss Sutton.
[233:40.91]Darian.
[233:42.35]He attacked me.
[233:44.45]His eyes, they were full of pure hatred.
[233:47.29]It was as though he didn't even know me.
[233:49.67]Please be calm, Miss Sutton.
[233:51.43]It is not Darian who attacks you.
[233:52.95]It is the curse attacking you.
[233:54.98]You see, he is quiet now.
[233:56.90]He fights the curse with all his strength, just like his father did.
[234:00.42]But he cannot stop it forever.
[234:01.94]It looks like it was made in the movies.
[234:09.18]That's a plus, not a minus.
[234:12.10]Okay, so...
[234:15.31]Give me his gun.
[234:20.32]Give that shit to me right now.
[234:22.20]And give me all of your bullets.
[234:25.22]I want at least 100 bullets.
[234:28.89]And give me this shit too.
[234:31.83]And give me that.
[234:56.87]Very good, Miss Sutton.
[234:58.15]We must let Mr. Dayne rest now.
[234:59.77]The cure will take some time to be fully effective.
[235:02.90]I shall watch over him for now.
[235:04.92]And I think it best if we do not tell him what happened during his fever.
[235:08.72]Okay.
[235:08.90]It would upset him greatly to know that you almost came to great harm by his hand.
[235:12.95]Miss Sutton, I hope you now appreciate the power that your prize exhibit possesses.
[235:17.57]And I need not point out the grave consequences should it escape our grasp completely this evening.
[235:22.99]I have heard from the staff that a known chief, the Shah...
[235:25.72]Let's chat.
[235:26.06]North of the atrium.
[235:26.66]So, I'm just going to take everything.
[235:28.82]Like, obviously.
[235:29.26]Just take it all.
[235:29.84]Leave him a lantern and stick.
[235:56.71]I already got one of these.
[236:01.80]What about you?
[236:02.14]What do you got?
[236:14.63]There we go.
[236:16.75]Oh, wait.
[236:17.21]Actually, keep... I don't want these arrows.
[236:30.65]Anything else I don't want?
[236:35.45]No, I need more of these.
[236:37.39]Wait, I still have this.
[236:38.33]Should I just give this to him?
[236:46.93]Hey, I'm not going to lie.
[236:47.61]I don't think Chrono Trigger is happening.
[236:49.87]Well, I've got some good news for you.
[236:53.91]After this break coming up here.
[236:56.39]That is exactly what we are doing.
[237:05.69]We're going to play for two or three hours.
[237:11.77]No.
[237:14.51]Saying a lot of no's.
[237:15.25]It's alright.
[237:18.15]You're not going to finish this game either.
[237:20.79]That's debatable.
[237:21.99]I actually really like it.
[237:23.78]You're a third of the way through this game now.
[237:27.52]So what?
[237:28.36]Okay, let's call it in four or five hours.
[237:31.06]Played it for like an hour or so last night.
[237:35.65]This can be another thing we just jump to.
[237:37.75]I love this game.
[237:38.47]I think it's really fun and you are absolutely guaranteed going to see it again.
[237:43.27]Promise 100%.
[237:48.26]Didn't you just do a poll to keep playing this a half an hour ago?
[237:52.04]Uh, that was an hour and a half ago.
[237:56.08]So.
[237:57.68]That was that was 90 minutes ago.
[238:03.97]Just like Infinity Nikki.
[238:08.89]Yeah, I want to get through Chrono.
[238:10.26]I've been kind of itching to play it too, so... You are 100% guaranteed to see this.
[238:16.12]You're not going to see it tomorrow.
[238:18.27]There's not going to be a stream tomorrow.
[238:20.93]But... You never know.
[238:25.71]Which one is it?
[238:37.48]Well, contradicting immediately in the same breath is just, that's just, that's wild.
[238:46.27]Uh, I might be live tomorrow night.
[238:48.51]Maybe.
[238:49.87]But, I really like this game.
[238:51.81]I think there's a lot of, this game has a lot of all the check boxes for me.
[238:56.42]Which is, it's a little clunky.
[238:59.02]It's kind of funny.
[239:00.28]It's got funny animations.
[239:01.38]It's got interesting characters.
[239:03.48]I like it a lot.
[239:04.50]You will see it again.
[239:11.79]Maybe we'll do this if I do stream tomorrow night.
[239:14.39]Probably not, but if I do, maybe we'll do a late night stream of this.
[239:19.01]Maybe some Chrono Trigger.
[239:19.83]We never know.
[239:22.21]I'm coming up on a break in like five minutes.
[239:24.29]I think I'm going to just call this right here and just move to Chrono.
[239:29.45]Or what can I do in like five minutes in this game?
[239:30.95]Let's see.
[239:33.41]I don't really want to.
[239:33.93]I think I want to start from here.
[239:34.88]So we're good.
[239:39.16]Alright.
[239:40.30]Let me move to Chrono.
[239:45.19]I'm very much enjoying this.
[239:47.31]Curse the Eye of Isis.
[239:49.60]We will finish this game.
