[ve:60.16.100]

[00:07.14]Hello?
[00:09.18]Want to call me early?
[00:10.02]I don't think I'm early.
[00:12.13]I think I'm right on time.
[00:13.35]Hey, by the way, since doing the new schedule, the once a week Andy, I don't think I've been late at all.
[00:24.74]I think I've started at exactly 12 to 12.
[00:26.40]Oh, wait, no, that was the one time where my computer was freaking out.
[00:32.58]Binding of Isaac was freaking out.
[00:35.47]But for the most part, like 80% of the time, it's been exactly at 12 p.m.
[00:41.56]How you doing?
[00:42.02]How was your week?
[00:43.50]Was it good?
[00:48.22]Wow.
[00:48.78]I'm Andy.
[00:53.03]Today, we're going to be playing a new game.
[00:58.07]I know everyone, you don't want to hear that.
[00:59.47]We're playing Pokémon Snap Switch Edition.
[01:04.86]Now, I do have a problem with the title.
[01:07.96]I don't know what it is with Nintendo in this shit, but they're the only people that do this.
[01:13.26]Nintendo is the only company besides some furniture cleaning companies and, like, Lysol spray type companies that put new in front of stuff and has made a new product.
[01:27.83]Like, new OxiClean!
[01:31.66]New Pokémon Snap.
[01:33.26]New Super Mario Brothers.
[01:34.46]They're the only company.
[01:36.08]There's one of four kind of companies that do this.
[01:41.73]Pokémon Snap.
[01:43.05]You can't come up with a better name than New Pokémon Snap?
[01:45.71]That was a pre-written joke.
[01:50.51]You better believe it was.
[01:53.55]It wasn't.
[01:53.87]I came up with that right now.
[01:56.94]I'm just sitting here like I got a notepad with a bunch of potential intro jokes.
[02:02.33]And I'm going to use them.
[02:03.31]I wrote them down.
[02:05.09]I'm a comedian.
[02:05.59]I know comedy.
[02:07.63]I know it.
[02:08.87]Tell me I don't.
[02:10.89]Does this game suck?
[02:11.51]I don't know.
[02:14.15]It has a camera.
[02:15.25]And you take pictures of different Pokemons.
[02:19.84]I'm kind of excited.
[02:20.66]It's a camera.
[02:21.14]It's a game with a camera.
[02:22.86]Do you have a plan B?
[02:26.34]No.
[02:29.83]Well, hold on.
[02:31.17]I had a plan A. This is the plan B, if you must know.
[02:35.88]So I had a plan A. Plan A was I downloaded, I don't know, maybe 30 to 40 dogshit iPad games.
[02:46.12]And was going to do a dogshit iPad game stream.
[02:50.39]And what happened was, started to kind of vet them a little bit.
[02:54.73]And none of them were fun or funny.
[02:57.89]So, I have to kind of go back to the drawing board on that one.
[03:02.05]Like, they would just, like, I start, I, like, opened them and realized they would just kind of, like, take over my iPad and shit.
[03:08.55]It, like, wasn't even worth doing.
[03:10.91]So, like, six made it out of, like, the 40 that I found.
[03:14.31]So, what's going to have to happen is over the next probably week or two, I'm going to compile more and do that at some point.
[03:22.39]That was the plan A. This is the plan B. It's a virus stream, you know.
[03:29.84]So you downloaded viruses.
[03:31.40]Willingly.
[03:32.38]Yes.
[03:34.16]They're not viruses.
[03:35.32]They're just bad.
[03:36.20]Alright.
[03:41.28]You know what like probably the worst insult to like a game designer is?
[03:46.26]Like a game developer?
[03:48.36]Is if you call their game a virus game.
[03:50.54]Because that just means that holy shit this was so bad that like I think it may have infected my computer.
[03:59.66]That's bottom, absolute bottom of the barrel.
[04:01.76]To be, to have you, to say that about somebody's game.
[04:08.34]I just like, I just made that game for fun.
[04:10.64]I just was like playing around in like Unity.
[04:14.02]This is a virus game?
[04:15.84]Oh.
[04:16.00]Would you at least have said cereal box?
[04:22.95]It's malware.
[04:25.82]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:27.42]I'm ready to play.
[04:28.08]By the way, this is the first Pokémon game I've played on the channel.
[04:30.72]Do you count the TV one?
[04:35.08]Like, watch TV with Pikachu?
[04:37.07]I guess that's, um... Does that count?
[04:41.93]Does this game count?
[04:42.93]Is this non-canon?
[04:44.95]I don't know.
[04:51.97]What did you say?
[04:54.25]Dear my god, I'm so tired of this schedule.
[04:55.83]I'd rather you stream one minute a day per week.
[05:00.19]Alright, I would have been gone five minutes ago.
[05:04.05]That would be the shittiest content.
[05:06.65]Can you imagine if I just showed up for a minute and then left?
[05:10.43]That's just enough time to remind a bunch of people that their sub is running out.
[05:16.20]I'm not going to do that.
[05:16.90]Alright, let's go.
[05:22.81]Leave now.
[05:25.09]Alright, English.
[05:27.29]Please select your appearance.
[05:28.71]You can't change your appearance.
[05:30.27]This kind of looks like me.
[05:37.17]Which one?
[05:37.75]I have blue eyes.
[05:38.25]This is me.
[05:43.58]Jeremy.
[05:45.86]Sure.
[05:46.62]I'm just going to be... I guess I'm just going to be Jeremy.
[05:51.12]That's me.
[05:51.89]I'm not being a character today.
[05:56.31]It's just me.
[05:56.85]What do you mean today?
[06:02.01]I'm not being a character today.
[06:04.40]Like do I normally?
[06:05.26]Am I normally a fucking character?
[06:06.68]What am I talking about?
[06:08.84]No, I'm gonna be me today.
[06:15.49]Why does this snap look so blown up and like awful looking?
[06:24.04]Is that a Pokémon?
[06:30.11]Get Pikachu out of here.
[06:31.11]They only put him in here for fucking nostalgia.
[06:34.71]I want the new Pokémon.
[06:35.97]I don't care about Pikachu.
[06:37.24]He's only in here for nostalgia.
[06:40.52]Greetings.
[06:47.86]Hi there.
[06:49.54]I'm glad you made it.
[06:50.32]Who's the professor that everyone was pissed off that I didn't know who it was?
[06:53.56]It's not Professor Mirror, right?
[06:55.25]It was Professor Oak?
[06:56.97]It's the one that I didn't know, and everyone freaked out.
[07:00.95]Welcome to the Laboratory of Ecology and Natural Sciences, or LENS for short.
[07:06.59]My name is Mirror.
[07:09.54]Yeah, I didn't know who Professor Oak was.
[07:13.38]I'm researching Pokémon and their natural environment here on Florio Island.
[07:17.24]Yeah.
[07:18.75]Yeah, and that's not all.
[07:19.75]The professor is going to study every single island here in the Lentil region.
[07:24.90]No one's ever done an ecological survey like this before.
[07:28.60]It's going to be amazing.
[07:31.92]No one?
[07:32.30]Aren't you forgetting a certain explorer?
[07:33.66]Are Pokémon considered wild animals?
[07:38.79]Is that... What are... Are they... Yes, they are.
[07:43.47]Yeah.
[07:45.91]I don't know if they were like... They're supposed to be like cartoons or something.
[07:52.70]It's a good point you've read the stories of Captain Vince I
[08:00.68]I don't know anything about- I don't know anything about Pokémon.
[08:02.86]This is the worst channel you could watch right now that's playing this.
[08:06.32]I'm just going to criticize and annoy you if you're a fan of this universe.
[08:10.82]This is the game you play if you're a fan of the universe.
[08:13.40]This is like the side, I'm a fan of the universe game.
[08:16.74]I'm not a fan of the universe, and here I am.
[08:19.24]I just like cameras in video games.
[08:25.23]Well, thanks.
[08:28.49]This is Rita.
[08:29.51]Her parents are good friends of mine.
[08:30.75]She's here on vacation while her school's on break.
[08:34.07]I'm not just here to goof off, Professor.
[08:36.25]I'm your research assistant.
[08:38.42]Ah, yes, that's right, and I appreciate the help.
[08:40.62]Now, before we go over what you'll be doing in this program, why don't we step into the lab and get settled?
[08:47.98]Right you are, Professor.
[08:49.20]I'll lead the way.
[08:50.00]Camera Andy.
[08:54.32]Yeah, it's fun.
[08:57.36]I see you got yourself a fucking gamer chair over there.
[09:00.99]Alright, allow me to explain.
[09:03.51]Yeah, these are wild animals in this person's house.
[09:08.53]That's what I was talking about.
[09:09.64]Like, are these wild animals just running around in this house?
[09:13.36]The lentil region is absolutely teeming with Pokémon.
[09:17.58]Photographing those Pokémon helps us learn more about them and their ecosystem.
[09:22.45]They can be tamed.
[09:26.33]Yeah, alright, I understand.
[09:27.45]You've, like, you watched the one YouTube video of the guy that has, like, the alligator as a pet.
[09:32.55]And it has, like, 1.6 million views.
[09:35.74]And we've all seen it.
[09:36.72]And we're like, holy shit, that's fucking crazy.
[09:38.32]But you don't actually have an alligator in your house.
[09:40.44]You're not going to.
[09:41.72]It's, like, three people on Earth.
[09:48.04]A fatal frame.
[09:50.30]And now you might even get to see glowing Pokémon.
[09:52.10]They're really, really...
[09:54.62]Now, without further ado, here's your research camera.
[09:56.86]Oh, that's pretty shitty for a camera that I'm going to get.
[10:00.22]It looks like a Walmart disposable camera.
[10:03.58]You couldn't have ponied up a little bit more research money and given me a fucking DSLR?
[10:09.51]I've got the same one.
[10:10.43]We can use them to communicate with each other and the rest of the team, too.
[10:15.65]That's right.
[10:16.17]It's more than just a camera.
[10:17.07]It lets you keep in touch and analyze data on the fly.
[10:19.45]So it's an iPhone.
[10:20.45]Yep.
[10:21.25]Yep.
[10:21.85]Yep.
[10:22.73]It'll also serve as sort of an ID badge for you here.
[10:25.51]So take good care of it.
[10:26.33]Wait, it's an ID?
[10:32.01]Now remember, son, there's only 25 photos on there.
[10:35.47]And what you're going to do is you're going to take that to a wedding.
[10:37.35]You're going to take nine pictures.
[10:40.15]There's going to be 21 more photos on it.
[10:42.51]It's going to sit in your closet for 16 years.
[10:45.67]You're going to take it out.
[10:46.39]You're going to take 10 more pictures on it.
[10:47.97]You're going to put it back in your closet.
[10:50.47]Two more years go by.
[10:51.93]You're going to throw it in the trash and never get the photos developed.
[10:56.92]Awesome, right?
[11:01.00]The professor invented it.
[11:03.32]Can I explain how to use it, professor?
[11:04.56]You're projecting again.
[11:07.74]I mean, I've done that like probably four or five times.
[11:11.63]Who's ever developed photos from one of those cameras?
[11:13.59]Can I explain how to use it, Professor?
[11:18.33]Sure thing, Rita.
[11:20.29]Assist away.
[11:21.29]I'll go take care of some other preparations.
[11:24.57]Alright, come on.
[11:24.99]Let's go outside.
[11:26.24]I can't wait to take my first photo as a photo Pokémon journalist.
[11:30.60]Tutorials are based on the default button layouts.
[11:32.32]Yeah, alright.
[11:36.14]Perfect timing.
[11:38.64]Let me shoot it.
[11:40.74]Alright, press A to take a photo.
[11:44.10]I can't move the camera?
[11:49.48]That was a bad picture.
[11:50.62]Alright, that's A. Okay.
[11:57.52]And it's shaped like a Pokeball!
[11:59.35]Okay.
[12:01.13]Okay.
[12:08.62]Oh, I see.
[12:09.02]Alright.
[12:10.03]So we gotta get the house in the frame too.
[12:13.45]Can you imagine needing to tell somebody how to use a camera?
[12:21.19]Am I a caveman?
[12:23.77]Why do they have to teach me this?
[12:27.22]Oh, look.
[12:27.42]Here comes a Pikachu.
[12:31.20]Oh, what's the zoom button?
[12:34.78]You're a small child.
[12:37.00]No, I'm not.
[12:38.04]How old is this kid?
[12:38.78]Like, fucking 12?
[12:40.02]That's old enough to know how to use a camera.
[12:44.80]First move so it's lined up with Pikachu.
[12:46.66]Okay.
[12:50.48]Yeah, but who does a center shot?
[12:53.59]Amateur?
[12:53.97]It needs to be, like, over here.
[12:55.41]And I know someone's gonna go, Rule of thirds is bullshit.
[12:58.55]Don't use it.
[13:00.09]I use it.
[13:00.67]I think it looks good.
[13:05.90]I did.
[13:07.94]Okay, so there's like a face recognition.
[13:12.22]I always turn that off.
[13:13.12]I hate that.
[13:13.60]Okay.
[13:20.96]Got it.
[13:22.28]You're using it wrong.
[13:23.36]I don't even have control of the camera right now.
[13:26.98]It's called zooming in.
[13:33.99]Hold ZL.
[13:37.25]Looking nice and big.
[13:38.51]Oh, my God.
[13:39.05]Okay.
[13:45.71]See how much bigger it looked?
[13:47.12]You want your subject's whole body in the middle of the frame?
[13:53.88]No, you don't.
[13:54.52]Oh, right.
[14:05.36]Nice and big.
[14:06.08]Okay, the controls and settings.
[14:09.18]Pause menu.
[14:10.00]Alright.
[14:13.00]Oh, you taught him how to use a camera.
[14:15.02]Great.
[14:16.08]Now let's teach him how to pour cereal into a bowl.
[14:20.59]How to flush the toilet.
[14:22.93]And the very hard task of making your bed.
[14:28.47]How was that?
[14:28.89]I hope you're getting the hang of your research camera.
[14:38.15]Would you mind choosing one shot of each Pokémon you've photographed?
[14:42.25]I'll rate them using my special scoring system.
[14:44.61]Pick whichever shots you think are the best.
[14:45.95]I only took like two pictures.
[14:47.12]It's like the Pikachu folder.
[14:52.46]I have folders?
[14:53.88]Okay.
[14:56.36]You can choose a photo by moving the pointer.
[14:57.98]Press A when you've decided which one to show me.
[14:59.72]That one.
[15:05.38]Alright, how about the, the, the, the, the vil villain?
[15:08.02]The VI, the VI vil, the VI, the VI villain.
[15:12.40]Okay.
[15:13.14]I only took one picture.
[15:18.58]Or select show professor.
[15:21.04]Show him.
[15:26.52]Okay, what does he think?
[15:28.22]Starting with photo number one.
[15:31.22]It's beautiful.
[15:33.80]Oh, it's Pikachu.
[15:34.38]This is the first time you've gotten it as your subject.
[15:38.01]Pose, size, direction, placement, other Pokémon, background.
[15:43.17]It's one to four stars.
[15:46.32]I came up with a system to help us understand and categorize how Pokémon behave.
[15:51.05]Photos of Pokémon in an ordinary state get fewer stars.
[15:54.92]More unusual behavior means more stars.
[15:57.02]Alright.
[15:58.36]We just gotta get them doing weird, cool stuff.
[16:00.94]To be clear, the number of a star a photo receives doesn't affect its score.
[16:05.56]Every category is important.
[16:08.11]By the way, the camera keeps logs of what was happening when you took each photo.
[16:11.91]That data helps me categorize your photos.
[16:14.19]What does that mean?
[16:16.35]Hold on, let me get Ato.
[16:18.67]Ato, you wanna come up?
[16:36.28]hold on I was clearing out my closet hey show auto
[17:03.31]Oh, you didn't think... What?
[17:05.27]Excuse me.
[17:05.73]You didn't think that you were going to be able to see something important?
[17:10.52]You didn't think you were going to see a mustache Sith Lord?
[17:18.04]It's not really... There we go!
[17:32.34]My pants are unzipped?
[17:33.66]Are they?
[17:34.90]Are my pants unzipped?
[17:37.50]Oh my god, I think they are.
[17:39.42]I think my pants are unzipped.
[17:41.58]No, they're not.
[17:42.26]Okay, holy shit.
[17:43.42]That was just the most terrifying thing I've ever done in my life.
[17:46.50]I think my... That was like, in my mind, my career ended.
[17:52.95]I'll be honest with you.
[17:55.45]What going through my brain was my career is over.
[17:58.20]It's, it's over.
[17:59.08]I like, my, like, there's my, like, my, it's open.
[18:02.66]That's my biggest fucking fear.
[18:06.70]What?
[18:06.96]What?
[18:11.33]What's the matter?
[18:12.79]He's got a problem?
[18:22.90]I pulled out a lightsaber.
[18:25.63]Like, oh, this is like, it's like dick is out.
[18:29.37]That's like, I'm gone forever.
[18:31.01]But I mean, that would be like really, really funny way to go out.
[18:35.15]That would be like fucking crazy.
[18:36.96]Like I would live forever.
[18:40.84]That would be like, that would be an image or a video that would be shared forever.
[18:45.84]Like I would be, I would live forever.
[18:52.19]Anyways.
[19:00.10]By the way, the camera keeps logs of what was happening.
[19:02.02]What was I doing?
[19:02.72]Okay, let's move on to the scoring.
[19:08.86]I'll evaluate the subject's pose.
[19:14.79]Snapping your photo at just the right moment is key to getting a high pose score.
[19:19.15]I didn't show auto.
[19:20.23]I did not.
[19:21.76]Hold on.
[19:22.76]I'll show them in a few weeks.
[19:26.15]Okay, so it's pose.
[19:28.05]The larger your subject is in the photo, the better.
[19:32.22]And there's the direction the Pokémon is facing.
[19:35.36]So you want it to be big, facing you, doing a cool pose.
[19:39.66]Center of the frame.
[19:42.75]Bonus if there's other Pokémon in the photo.
[19:46.35]Alright.
[19:47.65]I just take good photos, whatever.
[19:55.66]So why is it right in the center?
[19:57.20]That's not usually good pictures.
[20:00.56]It's hard to believe you're a beginner.
[20:04.79]Alright, well I don't want to save this.
[20:08.13]That photo.
[20:08.55]I don't want it in my album.
[20:12.35]But that one's not as good.
[20:13.87]Okay.
[20:17.34]Good pose.
[20:17.98]Bad direction though.
[20:18.88]How is direction better than size?
[20:25.85]Which one is a Pokémon?
[20:28.09]They're all Pokémon.
[20:33.11]They're not supposed to be artistic photos.
[20:39.49]Well, I'm going to take some liberty and do that.
[20:42.63]I'm going to have some artistic photos.
[20:50.33]I'm supposed to just zoom in and take a picture of their face.
[20:54.52]I'm an artist.
[20:55.88]I should be treated as such.
[20:58.74]This is for scientific research.
[21:00.36]Look at this pod.
[21:04.91]It'll carry you on your photography expeditions.
[21:08.71]It's called the Neo One.
[21:11.95]It's the best.
[21:13.13]It can teleport to far off places in no time flat.
[21:15.89]You all know I like that word.
[21:17.83]And every time I get a chance to say it, I love saying it.
[21:21.76]I finally put the finishing touches on it not long ago with a little help from someone I know.
[21:26.82]See, it makes use of energy hotspots scattered throughout the lentil region.
[21:31.88]Come on, Professor, the details can wait.
[21:34.55]Alright, let's go.
[21:35.29]Climb on in and touch your camera to the console.
[21:41.13]What?
[21:41.49]Like the switch calls?
[21:46.56]Oh, he has to do it.
[21:55.06]Enjoy your first photo expedition.
[21:58.52]I'm like fucking 12.
[22:01.11]They just put me in an experimental like traveling pod.
[22:03.95]I don't have a license.
[22:05.99]They were just concerned about me not knowing how to use a camera.
[22:09.71]They're going to make me go drive a car.
[22:16.12]Oh, here we go.
[22:16.50]Here we go.
[22:16.76]Alright.
[22:20.32]Oh, beautiful.
[22:20.90]Alright.
[22:22.96]This weird guy over here.
[22:26.03]That's a good one.
[22:30.04]Got it!
[22:34.14]Come on, right into the camera, come here!
[22:36.86]Anybody else?
[22:41.71]Turn around!
[22:43.53]Turn around!
[22:45.33]Turn around!
[22:48.93]Turn around, please!
[22:51.29]Turn around!
[22:55.75]How many photos can I take?
[22:58.31]Oh, it's a little, it's a toy Pikachu.
[23:00.29]He's so bad.
[23:04.23]No, I'm not.
[23:04.91]What are you talking about?
[23:17.22]Shit.
[23:20.21]Damn it.
[23:22.40]No, that's artistic.
[23:23.22]That's an artistic photo.
[23:25.59]It's above the weeds.
[23:26.71]What's that thing?
[23:35.83]This is like too easy.
[23:37.99]Isn't it?
[23:38.33]This is easy.
[23:41.04]This is a ride.
[23:42.84]This is just a ride at Disney World.
[23:45.04]This is not hard.
[23:47.48]It is alright here to take a picture of.
[23:49.56]And it's moving for me.
[23:54.33]This is a kid's game.
[23:56.33]What?
[23:56.57]I just ride around and take pictures?
[24:04.81]I thought this was going to be like hard to do this or something.
[24:07.61]I don't know.
[24:08.03]This is so many pictures.
[24:13.04]You're a child.
[24:14.16]How many, how many Pokemons are in the game?
[24:19.46]Ready?
[24:21.98]Got it.
[24:22.40]Perfect.
[24:22.92]That's a perfect photo.
[24:27.45]Okay, here we go.
[24:29.29]You guys ready?
[24:31.89]If you were... I got it.
[24:33.59]If you were to offer me a million dollars right now for me to name these as they come on screen, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[24:42.90]I wouldn't be able to get one.
[24:44.10]Let's see if I can get one.
[24:49.76]It just showed me and I don't remember.
[24:58.31]I'm flying above.
[24:59.64]What's that?
[25:03.66]Is that?
[25:04.98]What is that?
[25:05.36]A hoot hoot?
[25:11.16]Come here.
[25:17.20]That was a bee doof.
[25:22.66]Right into the camera.
[25:23.55]Turn.
[25:27.91]Wait, is he gonna stay?
[25:29.57]I gotta get him flying by.
[25:31.03]He's gonna fly right here and I'm gonna get it.
[25:32.45]Oh my god, that was... This guy just wants me to take a picture of him.
[25:50.04]Whoa, get that.
[25:52.88]These are Pokemons?
[25:53.88]What the fuck are these things?
[25:57.38]They ran out of ideas.
[25:58.50]They ran out of ideas.
[25:59.36]This is like a friendship bracelet.
[26:01.96]That's not even a Pokémon.
[26:03.06]What is that?
[26:03.54]What's that?
[26:17.21]Basically, it's the end of the course.
[26:19.81]Okay.
[26:24.81]So, in conclusion, it's this.
[26:27.66]So basically, it's this.
[26:32.24]In theory, it's this.
[26:34.66]Anime does that a lot, doesn't it?
[26:39.06]A character will be talking and then they'll go, in conclusion, I think that this, this, this, this.
[26:44.80]In theory, this, this, this, this.
[26:49.23]Therefore, this, this, this, this.
[26:53.89]Okay, I took 39 photos.
[26:57.91]Now, just like before, it's time to show me some photos you took.
[27:05.62]Stop talking.
[27:08.26]Go ahead and choose one photo.
[27:09.72]Oh, I can only choose one photo per Pokémon.
[27:13.42]Oh, man.
[27:15.66]Okay.
[27:16.92]Dodrio.
[27:19.40]I only took two pictures of this guy?
[27:24.43]That means that one.
[27:26.60]This one's cooler, though.
[27:30.94]Why are these in such low quality?
[27:34.26]It's this one.
[27:35.80]Okay.
[27:37.60]Grookey.
[27:39.64]Which one of these is Grookey?
[27:42.98]Oh, it's that guy.
[27:44.60]It's this one.
[27:46.98]Kichu.
[27:48.30]It's the only one I have.
[27:49.14]Blue.
[27:52.89]Oh, Buffalant.
[27:54.75]Buffalant.
[27:56.07]I took way more pictures of Buffalant.
[27:57.44]What are you talking about?
[27:58.14]Bidoof.
[28:01.72]Oh, hold on.
[28:04.74]I like that one.
[28:08.54]That's a way cooler picture of the swan than the bidoof.
[28:15.64]I mean, that one's awesome.
[28:24.17]A Wurmple.
[28:28.47]That one.
[28:31.17]Humphie.
[28:33.25]Hmm, I guess this one.
[28:34.21]Palau.
[28:38.38]No, no, this one right in his face.
[28:42.22]This is easy.
[28:43.12]That was the easy one.
[28:47.06]Swanna.
[28:52.25]This photo is too clean.
[28:54.91]I like this one better.
[28:55.91]This one's just weird.
[29:00.48]Magic Harp.
[29:01.92]Hoothoot.
[29:04.46]What about the... What about the bird that flew by?
[29:08.92]There's no subject.
[29:14.42]Oh.
[29:16.37]Alright, that's it.
[29:17.21]I'm doing it.
[29:17.63]Wait, what about this one?
[29:22.85]That's pretty good.
[29:27.27]It's that one.
[29:29.59]Alright, here we go.
[29:32.23]What do you think about my tutorial moves?
[29:41.46]Okay, the villain.
[29:43.54]Wow, those are big numbers.
[29:49.86]Nice and big.
[29:50.80]Would you like to keep this new photo or the one in the photo deck?
[29:55.10]I'll keep the new one.
[29:55.70]It's way better.
[29:58.51]That's one star.
[30:01.65]Alright, Dodrio.
[30:05.67]Position, size.
[30:08.90]Direction, placement.
[30:10.64]It's not bad.
[30:13.82]It's a gold star.
[30:14.74]Yeah, it's one to four stars.
[30:19.06]That one's not good, but it still conveys a lot of emotion, I think.
[30:24.97]That conveys a lot.
[30:30.22]Less than a thousand.
[30:31.38]Two, that's fine.
[30:35.19]It conveys sadness.
[30:40.61]Ichu.
[30:41.93]That one's bad too.
[30:42.81]But he wasn't... I couldn't get a good photo of him.
[30:45.15]He was like far away.
[30:53.54]It was the first tutorial zone.
[30:56.84]Great timing.
[30:57.70]Great timing.
[31:01.24]Oh, other Pokémon.
[31:05.51]The sus guy is bad at photography.
[31:07.43]Do not call me the sus guy.
[31:09.09]Okay?
[31:10.49]That's not what I go by.
[31:12.21]That's not what I go by.
[31:13.27]My name is Jerma.
[31:14.43]This is the Jerma985 community.
[31:16.69]I'm not the sus guy.
[31:20.62]We're not going to run with that one.
[31:23.84]So, man, the sus guy really sucks at this.
[31:26.44]No, we're not doing it.
[31:27.24]I'm not being the sus guy.
[31:31.27]This is going to be a big one.
[31:35.15]That's a gold star.
[31:37.57]That's a platinum.
[31:39.45]I don't even know what kind of precious metal that is.
[31:41.39]That one's good too.
[31:44.57]It's cute.
[31:48.27]Size, direction, placement, other Pokémon.
[31:51.73]That's a gold star.
[31:52.39]A new discovery.
[32:00.98]Yeah, but it's not my fault they won't get boring photos.
[32:06.15]That's a... I mean, if this game is just take a photo of something close in the middle of the frame, that's the best you're going to get.
[32:15.85]Size.
[32:17.37]Direction.
[32:17.97]Placement.
[32:18.77]Yeah, that's a $5,000 play.
[32:25.51]Here come the sus fans.
[32:27.19]Same with this one.
[32:33.05]I gotta get other animals.
[32:34.97]I'm gonna call them animals.
[32:35.91]I'm not calling them Pokemons.
[32:38.08]I'm gonna say animals.
[32:39.06]It's way easier for me to say.
[32:42.14]Oh, I refuse to say Pokemons.
[32:49.46]I'm gonna say animals.
[32:55.95]Is that its butt?
[33:04.81]Do I get, um, do I get any upgrades?
[33:08.07]Research level, oh, here we go.
[33:10.59]I need 40,000 points to get to research level 2.
[33:12.09]Holy shit, I'm almost there.
[33:19.43]This guy doesn't like Pokémon.
[33:23.43]Hey, Wendt, thanks for the 20 community subs.
[33:26.56]20 subs from Wendt.
[33:28.10]Thank you.
[33:28.34]Thank you, though, that's a lot.
[33:31.88]Once that level goes up, you may see Pokémon behave in ways you haven't seen before.
[33:34.70]The key to raising your research level is to observe all types of animal behavior.
[33:40.06]That means getting photographies of them in every category from 1 to 4.
[33:46.32]So in short, fill up that po-to-that ANIMAL photo ba-library.
[33:51.91]Keep that in mind and you'll be on the right track.
[33:55.39]But get out there and snap lots of photos and cherish the encounters with the animals you have along the way.
[33:58.93]Way easier!
[34:00.72]I'd never have guessed it was your first trip out there.
[34:03.27]Keep up the good work.
[34:06.15]Does this do an iPad present?
[34:08.67]This is an iPad present.
[34:10.17]But I had to touch the screen for that to be an iPad present.
[34:12.71]You researched Florio Nature Park for the first time.
[34:17.28]You got a score of 1,000 points or more in the direction category during a photo evaluation.
[34:23.16]You got a score of 1,000 in the placement category.
[34:25.14]Yep.
[34:27.92]Save the photos you took to your album.
[34:30.80]Yes.
[34:33.72]After your research trips, you can choose photos to save to your album, which is in your space in the lab.
[34:39.70]You can also choose re-snap to make some changes to the photos before you save them.
[34:46.86]Okay.
[34:51.02]I want this one.
[34:51.82]Look at that.
[34:54.70]Re-snap.
[35:00.89]Wow, this is awesome.
[35:01.93]Okay, hold on.
[35:09.31]Oh, I want the focal point to be... There we go.
[35:20.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[35:20.88]I want it close.
[35:21.40]Not far away.
[35:23.14]Don't residency for me.
[35:24.06]This is a good photo.
[35:25.12]Relax.
[35:27.92]Where's the focal point?
[35:30.83]I want it, like, right... Where can I get it?
[35:33.42]I can't see it.
[35:34.00]Where is it?
[35:38.20]This isn't doing anything.
[35:39.64]I want the focal point up front.
[35:48.49]How come it's not changing anything?
[35:54.11]Oh, there we go.
[35:54.43]Okay.
[35:54.55]Perfect.
[35:57.69]Perfect.
[36:05.13]Can I zoom in?
[36:05.59]Can I put the camera down?
[36:18.70]It's got to be up here, like that.
[36:20.50]Yep, perfect.
[36:21.12]A little bit higher.
[36:29.17]Wow!
[36:34.59]Ugh.
[36:35.23]Ugh.
[36:36.03]How are these filters?
[36:39.55]What the fuck are these?
[36:41.07]Why is it green?
[36:44.60]They're all just silhouettes with different colors.
[36:51.22]Yeah, that's fine.
[37:02.47]Alright, snap that photo.
[37:04.15]Right there.
[37:09.03]Save this photo.
[37:09.61]Yes.
[37:09.85]Okay.
[37:15.75]Building a lodge.
[37:18.45]Okay, I'm ready.
[37:19.95]I don't need to save anymore.
[37:20.85]This is the fucking tutorial.
[37:22.00]I'm done.
[37:27.18]Fable 2, Fable 2, Fable 2.
[37:29.88]I'll see you with Fable 2 next week!
[37:41.05]You didn't save it?
[37:41.91]Come on.
[37:44.83]Let's go on a nighttime photo shoot.
[37:48.93]By the way, don't forget you can come back to the lab and take a look at your photo decks anytime.
[37:52.93]Cool.
[37:55.10]This is Fable 2, essentially.
[37:58.20]Well, don't let me keep you any longer.
[37:59.24]Go have a good time and snap some photos.
[38:05.75]Alright, let's go for it.
[38:07.73]Lab.
[38:08.35]Research.
[38:09.91]I think this is fun.
[38:12.41]Are you really going to play this for eight hours?
[38:16.73]I don't know.
[38:17.09]Play the baseball game again.
[38:20.77]I'm taking pictures of animals right now, alright?
[38:25.95]Don't worry, I'll play Pac-Man 99 later.
[38:29.33]And like Mario 30 whatever it is.
[38:35.16]Are you headed on another expedition now?
[38:39.50]Before you go, let me tell you one more thing you can do with your research camera.
[38:43.42]You can run a scan.
[38:45.45]That'll give you a thesis about histrionics, cool.
[38:48.19]Tells you about nearby animals and points out anything unusual.
[38:52.77]Professor, what counts as unusual?
[38:54.19]You've never given me a solid answer.
[38:55.91]Why is he going to have ski goggles?
[39:00.42]I don't know.
[39:01.02]What was that for?
[39:03.06]Is he like welding Pokémon together inside of his basement or something?
[39:06.22]Why does he have those?
[39:08.16]Basically, anything that makes the system go, check this out.
[39:14.14]Well, I guess that's all the detail we're going to get.
[39:15.56]Those are lab goggles.
[39:22.65]Are they?
[39:22.93]They look kind of huge.
[39:25.75]Why does he need... What do you... Okay, what does he need them for?
[39:31.85]She doesn't have them.
[39:32.79]I don't have them.
[39:33.57]Why does he have those?
[39:34.47]What are they for?
[39:37.27]Because of chemicals.
[39:38.19]I don't know.
[39:38.69]What chemicals with the animals or the Pokémon in his house?
[39:42.14]Why does he need them?
[39:47.20]Move on.
[39:49.40]That's fucking weird.
[40:00.23]I already... I'm holding... Alright, running a scan.
[40:04.85]X is scan.
[40:05.43]Okay.
[40:06.17]I can scan whatever I want?
[40:11.53]Oh, that's cool.
[40:13.65]That's not a Pokémon.
[40:14.31]That's a car.
[40:15.17]Okay.
[40:18.19]I did...
[40:29.39]Oh, I can analyze it.
[40:32.77]It's analyzed.
[40:35.09]Nioh 1, this vehicle is essential for your Pokémon research.
[40:40.20]Why did you just say that?
[40:40.94]Now I have to say it.
[40:41.96]Why did you just do that?
[40:44.04]Why did you do that?
[40:46.24]I just looked over and I saw it.
[40:47.42]Now I have to say it?
[40:48.44]Aaron!
[40:49.34]Aaron!
[40:50.75]Aaron!
[40:51.89]Aaron!
[40:52.89]Aaron!
[40:53.41]Why did you do that?
[40:55.11]There's no reason for you to say that.
[40:58.75]Now you should see the results.
[41:09.90]I'm not making a joke.
[41:11.02]Somebody told me to do it.
[41:16.56]That's not funny.
[41:17.84]I'm doing an impression of Armin from Attack on Titan.
[41:22.26]I'm just doing it.
[41:23.16]I have to.
[41:25.24]I'll do it over here so it's not as loud.
[41:28.68]I'm sorry, dude I have no idea.
[41:31.33]Do you know what it's like to fucking live with me?
[41:33.89]Do you know what it's like to be in the same house as me, in the same room as me?
[41:37.29]I do that shit.
[41:38.51]Just lying down.
[41:40.39]I just will be lying down and like hanging out and just start doing it.
[41:44.03]I'll just start saying Eren.
[41:46.56]Like 25 times in a row.
[41:53.56]In the shower, it doesn't matter.
[42:04.08]That's psychotic behavior.
[42:05.64]It is not.
[42:09.05]That's not psychotic behavior.
[42:11.35]That's called making myself giggle.
[42:17.71]Wait, I can yell at them to look at me?
[42:28.91]Hey professor, explanation's all done.
[42:30.23]Alright, let's go.
[42:37.89]Let's take some pictures.
[42:44.30]Wait, I can pick where we go?
[42:45.14]We're taking lots of photos of Pokémon at the nature park during the day.
[42:51.14]Let's go.
[42:52.78]Park during the day.
[42:55.09]Why don't we take a bunch of photos and surprise the professor with them?
[43:00.82]Is Aaron a streamer?
[43:05.42]Yes.
[43:13.61]We have 14,000 people watching.
[43:16.15]Well, that's not on me.
[43:17.15]That's on them.
[43:19.15]That's not on me.
[43:19.83]Alright, wait.
[43:22.35]Say cheese.
[43:23.59]How do I do it?
[43:30.14]Shit, I missed it.
[43:39.21]I gotta look left.
[43:39.91]Hold on.
[43:42.09]You woke him up.
[43:47.29]These photos are fucking dog shit.
[43:48.85]Hold on.
[43:49.21]They're dog shit.
[43:49.95]I need to make these better.
[44:03.77]How is he this bad?
[44:04.61]Wait, that's huge and right in frame.
[44:09.99]It just did something weird.
[44:11.83]I'm running a scan.
[44:13.17]Wait, scan.
[44:15.21]It wants me to look at something.
[44:17.89]It's dung.
[44:18.61]Some charred fruits on the ground.
[44:20.17]Did the Pokémon do this?
[44:22.22]Professor, those aren't fruits.
[44:25.94]Mushrooms?
[44:30.56]I scanned that?
[44:31.06]Yep.
[44:33.29]First bloom that grows on Florio Island.
[44:36.81]Cool.
[44:37.15]Alright, I gotta get a good one of these guys.
[44:43.51]Shit!
[44:44.93]Wasn't ready.
[44:54.62]Ah!
[44:55.10]Did I get it?
[45:00.87]Wait, wait!
[45:01.45]He just ran away!
[45:02.01]He just ran by me!
[45:04.88]I just missed something cool.
[45:09.54]The photo is so bad.
[45:11.64]Wait, hold on.
[45:12.36]I'm not done.
[45:14.50]You almost had it?
[45:17.12]What can I even do with the Magikarp?
[45:33.37]Hey.
[45:35.40]Look over here.
[45:38.54]Look over here.
[45:40.65]Got it.
[45:41.19]That was a perfect shot.
[45:42.77]For some reason, I thought I was going to crash.
[45:44.15]I thought I wasn't paying attention to the road and I was just roving to the ground.
[45:48.83]Hey!
[45:49.89]Wake up!
[45:51.17]Wake up!
[45:52.36]Wake up!
[45:54.66]Hoothoot has an unusual way of sleeping.
[45:55.98]Always on one foot.
[45:56.66]Wake up!
[46:01.82]Hey, Aaron!
[46:03.14]Stop!
[46:06.18]Stop saying that!
[46:12.63]I'm gonna get an awesome one here.
[46:13.83]I think it's gonna be right... Wait!
[46:18.99]Should I get him in the background?
[46:28.16]Say cheese!
[46:32.68]Say cheese!
[46:34.58]Hello!
[46:35.42]Do something!
[46:40.36]Aaron, stop.
[46:41.87]I'm going to lose my mind.
[46:42.89]What the hell?
[46:48.55]What is that?
[46:51.99]Hello?
[46:52.88]Turn this way.
[46:59.06]What is that?
[46:59.72]Hello?
[47:03.02]Turn.
[47:03.66]Turn and look at me.
[47:12.49]Turn and look.
[47:14.31]Turn and look.
[47:15.89]You're doing something weird.
[47:16.63]I don't know what it is, but I got it.
[47:22.01]Whatever.
[47:24.27]She doesn't want to look.
[47:24.99]She's camera shy.
[47:32.98]What even is this joke?
[47:34.06]What joke?
[47:34.50]I was taking a photo.
[47:36.16]What are you on about?
[47:37.64]Alright, here we go.
[47:42.69]Some of those are going to be worth a lot.
[47:46.05]Took the same pictures.
[47:47.29]I did not take the same pictures.
[47:49.50]That one's the same.
[47:50.30]Alright, these are the same photos.
[47:55.94]Alright, look at the funny face he's making.
[48:00.68]That one.
[48:04.89]Awful.
[48:08.47]Just awful.
[48:08.81]Awful.
[48:14.91]one okay I got you wait I got a three star potential here holy shit I'll take it his eyes are closed that's kind of funny I think his eyes are closed that's a kind of funny right oh yeah that when he's popping out his chest
[48:47.28]How is that a two-star photo?
[48:48.28]It's horrible.
[48:53.44]Wait, this... How is that... This one's better?
[48:55.82]How is that one better?
[48:57.52]Alright, let's go.
[49:00.73]Oh, I have to do from every folder.
[49:06.81]None of these are worth pulling in.
[49:08.77]I mean, that one's kind of cool.
[49:14.55]Oh, these are like... These suck.
[49:21.18]Not better, but more special.
[49:22.42]Oh, okay.
[49:30.38]Pose is worse.
[49:32.70]Size is worse.
[49:33.66]Everything is worse but placement.
[49:36.88]Well, I'm not keeping this one.
[49:37.86]Keep the old one.
[49:43.42]That's the same picture I took before.
[49:46.72]What's the difference?
[49:49.52]I want to know what the difference is.
[49:54.43]The only difference is the two of their eyes are closed.
[49:58.92]It's a worse photo.
[50:04.82]Okay, the pose is probably better.
[50:06.54]I could work on size.
[50:10.24]Alright, now this is a three star.
[50:21.27]three star pose size direction placement that's not that's three gold stars that's gonna be worth a lot nice work oh is this one okay I did you guys hear that did you did you hear that did that pick up on the mic anybody hear that like
[50:48.56]That was the lightsaber.
[50:50.01]I didn't touch it.
[50:50.73]It just turned on.
[50:51.83]I didn't do anything.
[51:01.19]This one's bad too, but it's probably fine.
[51:03.47]Alright, I'll be at research level 2, right?
[51:06.77]We got another 10.
[51:10.55]You know how we say it here.
[51:12.07]Say it with me.
[51:13.43]Another 10?! !
[51:15.80]Community subs.
[51:17.40]From Wente Lair.
[51:20.80]Thank you.
[51:24.35]Alright, another step forward for our research, I bet.
[51:27.35]I bet animals in the area are getting comfortable with you.
[51:32.29]By the way, thanks to the progress you've made in your research, I've got something to report.
[51:36.42]I feel even once your photos are squared away, I think you'll be pleased to hear this.
[51:39.76]Alright, should I save any of these?
[51:45.57]No, none of these did it for me.
[51:46.69]Except for maybe this one.
[51:52.35]I'm really into like the bird photos.
[51:54.05]These are awful.
[52:09.81]How are these filters?
[52:13.80]These are terrible.
[52:20.08]I was thinking of like Snapchat, Instagram filters.
[52:25.94]Like iPhone filters.
[52:29.00]You get better ones later.
[52:30.14]Oh, alright.
[52:31.15]Okay, then we'll fuck this.
[52:32.17]I'm out.
[52:37.19]None of these were any good.
[52:38.31]Wait.
[52:39.47]That one's kind of cool.
[52:40.93]Saving that one.
[52:51.33]How does this boomer know what Snapchat is?
[52:57.33]You're not... You're telling me that you've never downloaded Snapchat and put, like, Trump's face on your face and just, like, recorded yourself going, let me tell you, listen, no, believe me.
[53:09.50]Every single one of us did that.
[53:16.01]There's not one person, I don't think, in the world that didn't do that for, like, 10 minutes.
[53:27.32]only boomers do that that was when face swapping was first introduced I've never done that and I don't intend to I I'm just telling you like that's what people did here's the thing
[53:50.42]How many times I put on from Game of Thrones?
[53:54.35]Putting on like different characters' faces and just doing their monologues?
[54:05.48]SNL humor.
[54:08.78]That's me putting like a face on my face.
[54:12.66]I'm not sharing this with the public, by the way.
[54:14.89]I was just doing it in the comfort of my privacy in my own living room.
[54:30.56]That's even weirder.
[54:31.54]That is not weirder.
[54:34.06]How many of you sing in the shower?
[54:36.62]I want to know.
[54:37.10]How many people here sing in the shower?
[54:42.28]Some of you.
[54:42.86]I know at least some of you do.
[54:44.88]Actually me?
[54:45.70]Me?
[54:46.08]Me?
[54:46.34]Me?
[54:47.30]Okay.
[54:48.28]Is that insane?
[54:49.84]Are you insane for doing that?
[54:51.88]I don't sing in the shower.
[54:53.04]I do like celebrity impressions in the shower.
[54:56.04]What's the difference?
[54:59.02]You are imitating...
[55:01.40]A song that you heard, I'm imitating a person I've heard.
[55:04.52]How's that different?
[55:06.64]It's the same thing.
[55:07.26]There's a big difference.
[55:18.76]No, it's not.
[55:20.68]You singing firework in your shower is the exact same thing as me just putting my hands up, looking left and right, with the water hitting me in the face, going, excuse me, believe me.
[55:33.59]It's the same thing.
[55:34.27]It's the exact same thing.
[55:36.02]It's just you happen to have a tone while you're doing it.
[55:43.92]Why do you sing in the shower?
[55:45.14]What's it for?
[55:50.74]Is Armin a celebrity?
[55:52.96]I mean, kind of.
[55:58.07]I mean, is he?
[55:59.11]I mean, yeah.
[56:03.39]The actor is like an actor.
[56:05.13]I'm imitating an actor.
[56:05.99]What?
[56:21.66]really funny he is he's doing voices at well touching himself in the shower you can't just add shit on to this missing the plot this animals you take photos of who cares for now enjoy your nighttime outing okay sometimes you wonder if I'm a lab experiment
[56:52.73]What you should be wondering is how did I get out?
[57:04.26]At night, you might be able to see the Illumina Phenomenon at the nature park.
[57:10.60]Observe your surroundings carefully.
[57:15.65]There's currently a poll.
[57:17.01]51% of you are sitting in the shower.
[57:21.55]And I'm weird for doing, like, celebrity impressions in the shower.
[57:28.32]I'm the weird guy.
[57:29.88]But when you are singing, you are imitating the voice, the cadence, and the tone of the singer who sings the song.
[57:41.00]You're crazy.
[57:48.46]You're the weird sus guy.
[57:59.25]I... I love this.
[58:01.01]This is fun.
[58:02.07]Okay.
[58:02.83]Here we go.
[58:03.19]We're at night.
[58:05.47]Ooh!
[58:08.91]Anybody else?
[58:14.85]Anybody on the... Wait!
[58:15.81]That's gonna be a lot.
[58:18.58]I got, like, all the meat.
[58:21.02]I need a face.
[58:23.40]Hey!
[58:26.30]Ooh!
[58:26.58]Did I get him smiling?
[58:34.98]Come on, give me a good picture of uh... Shit, whatever.
[58:42.06]No, someone's doing something cute and I'm not looking.
[58:44.83]You!
[58:46.87]Get back here!
[58:47.33]I gotta get the- the Scorch Bunny in the background.
[59:01.46]Remember, this game sucks.
[59:05.83]Whoa, what is that?
[59:09.47]I got all the meat.
[59:10.15]I got a shitload of meat.
[59:19.85]Honestly, never did I think that people would be mad that I'm playing a Pokémon game.
[59:24.06]You know how many people beg me to play Pokémon?
[59:26.52]Jeremiah, how come you don't play Pokémon?
[59:27.80]It's so fun.
[59:28.52]You're gonna love it.
[59:29.54]Pokémon's awesome.
[59:30.72]I love Pokémon.
[59:31.40]Do you love Pokémon?
[59:32.86]I love Pokémon.
[59:36.51]Got it.
[59:39.31]Where's the thing that I need to scan?
[59:42.73]Already got that.
[59:53.29]Come on, right here.
[59:53.97]Right when he was snoring, perfect.
[60:04.02]All Pokémon games are garbage.
[60:10.25]Wake up.
[60:22.80]I got him with his wings in the air.
[60:23.90]Nice.
[60:24.14]Alright, what about you?
[60:30.38]Hoot hoot?
[60:37.65]Oh shit!
[60:40.32]I freaked out.
[60:49.61]That was a beautiful pose.
[60:56.15]Do something.
[61:01.99]Do something.
[61:02.59]Do something funny.
[61:08.74]Well, now I know what it's like.
[61:11.90]Say streamer, do something funny.
[61:14.65]Now I know.
[61:28.12]Come on, one more.
[61:30.12]Come on again.
[61:34.24]That's a good one.
[61:34.96]That's a very good one.
[61:37.42]Where is this thing?
[61:37.98]Is this something to scan?
[61:39.06]Where is it?
[61:44.60]Where's the thing I need to scan?
[61:50.38]Where's the thing I have to scan?
[61:53.28]Where is it?
[61:53.61]I already scanned it.
[61:56.95]I just picked you a huge energy reading.
[62:02.59]What?
[62:06.05]A huge energy reading?
[62:07.13]Holy shit, I got it right at the last minute of the buzzer.
[62:25.69]Alright, what'd I get?
[62:27.33]Got a lot to discuss, but first, let's get your photos evaluated.
[62:31.49]Is this actually any good?
[62:32.39]Um, I don't, I, I don't know.
[62:36.64]I'm, I'm, sorry, I'm currently talking to a bunch of people who are covering their eyes and their ears at the same time and screaming.
[62:44.24]I don't, I don't know.
[62:45.20]Can they tell?
[62:46.02]Can the people watching this tell?
[62:51.74]Which one of these is good?
[62:54.04]That one.
[63:01.97]Probably that one.
[63:02.80]This is worth three.
[63:07.92]It was mid-jump.
[63:11.12]That one's good.
[63:14.88]That's a four-star photo.
[63:16.75]Thank you.
[63:19.01]Insert.
[63:21.07]Oh, come on.
[63:21.69]It's right when he came out of the hole.
[63:22.87]That's awesome.
[63:23.53]That was a great photo.
[63:26.27]What?
[63:28.91]This is not like a five-star image.
[63:40.67]Alright, which one of these is any good?
[63:42.90]Probably that one.
[63:45.08]Oh, I like that one.
[63:45.78]No, this one's good.
[63:48.26]Swano.
[63:53.26]He's so far away.
[63:54.36]Ducks.
[63:58.52]Oh, I know Pidgeotto.
[64:04.24]Hoothoot.
[64:09.72]It's not that one.
[64:13.04]It's that one.
[64:14.53]Look at how good this is.
[64:16.99]It's this one, right?
[64:18.79]This one's off center, but it's closer.
[64:20.45]I'm going with this one.
[64:21.73]It's more intense.
[64:22.51]And then a crystal bloom.
[64:30.46]And then did I have one of... Where's Pichu in this photo?
[64:34.72]There is no Pichu.
[64:37.76]Do I wear deodorant?
[64:38.58]I do.
[64:38.86]I do.
[64:43.63]I do not wear an antiperspirant.
[64:45.25]I wear a deodorant.
[64:49.69]That one's good.
[64:55.26]Placement.
[64:58.78]That's a silver.
[64:59.88]I'll take it.
[65:05.44]Uh, antiperspirant burns my underarms.
[65:07.48]I gotta be honest.
[65:11.04]I will put on a deodorant with antiperspirant in it, and six hours later, there will be just red marks under my arms.
[65:19.36]It's a diamond photo.
[65:30.67]Alright, that's pretty good.
[65:31.35]I might be allergic to aluminum.
[65:40.65]interesting great timing that means it's working yeah you really it's really gonna burn your skin for you to know it's working a new discovery that's a good photo nice work yeah a lot of uh antipersons use aluminum dioxide yeah that doesn't sound good four stars but it's bronze oh well that's the first four star um painting
[66:16.36]You can't sweat if your skin has melted off.
[66:22.02]Is that true?
[66:25.18]A new discovery.
[66:27.70]Nice work.
[66:29.40]No, deodorant's fine.
[66:31.98]Deodorant just makes it so you don't smell.
[66:34.26]It just makes you smell nice.
[66:41.69]A new discovery.
[66:46.76]And antiperspirant, and here's the thing about antiperspirant.
[66:49.96]I'm about to let you guys in on a very, very, very strong held, not a secret.
[66:53.36]This is literally, you can just Google this in five seconds to figure this out.
[66:56.72]If you wear antiperspirant, it makes you sweat more.
[67:02.02]In my case, I used to put this on.
[67:05.08]I would put on just like a standard, just deodorant antiperspirant.
[67:08.30]And I would just, I would be soaking through my shirt and my underarms.
[67:18.49]since I have stopped wearing this is a this is absolutely true this is completely true since I have stopped using an antiperspirant over time I don't have you guys remember how I lift up my shirt and I'd be like oh sweat check I don't have like big wet marks on my arms anymore you're nose blind no I'm not a new discovery
[67:49.95]Sweat check.
[67:50.45]Sweat check?
[67:55.32]You want to prove it?
[67:57.30]Alright.
[67:58.44]Clean.
[67:59.14]Wait, I don't want you to see that far in my arm.
[68:01.80]Clean, look.
[68:03.83]This is clean.
[68:05.81]This is clean.
[68:08.43]I mean, it's a little.
[68:24.12]My career is over.
[68:26.34]Oh, no, I hate it.
[68:27.38]I'm so pissed.
[68:28.16]I really thought there was nothing there.
[68:30.74]What?
[68:30.84]Do you remember how huge it was before?
[68:32.68]Do you remember how gigantic it was?
[68:35.26]And remember, listen, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[68:38.72]This is Las Vegas, Nevada, okay?
[68:42.36]It's very hot here.
[68:43.80]Even with like air conditioning, I'm sitting down getting really heated streaming in like a hot streamer room.
[68:49.26]This is, that's, you should have seen how it was like a few years ago.
[68:54.12]Do you remember how fucking revolting it was?
[68:57.36]It was revolting three or four years ago.
[69:00.89]I would lift it up and it would be like somebody, it was a joke, like somebody poured water on me.
[69:13.90]I want to know how good this one is.
[69:17.56]That's... Okay, good.
[69:18.84]That's diamond.
[69:27.03]It looks sad.
[69:28.49]I don't like this picture.
[69:29.35]Nice work.
[69:42.93]Maybe you just have a better diet?
[69:44.91]No.
[69:46.86]I don't think so.
[69:47.64]It's because I was wearing antiperspirant.
[69:49.20]I don't wear it anymore.
[69:50.80]I just wear like a gentle deodorant.
[69:57.24]It was the mayo sweats.
[70:00.59]Alright.
[70:08.61]Level one.
[70:10.51]Going on to level two.
[70:11.65]Almost.
[70:19.23]Your sweat backing up is causing your back pain.
[70:31.80]That would be quite a discovery.
[70:35.56]Okay.
[70:37.08]Crystal Bloom.
[70:39.42]By the way, thanks to the progress you've made in your research, I've got something to report.
[70:43.36]I'll fill you in once your photos are squared away.
[70:45.63]I think you'll be pleased to hear this.
[70:48.76]I don't want to save any of those.
[70:53.14]Sponsored viewer.
[70:53.96]This game is awesome.
[70:55.14]PogChamp.
[70:58.26]You can save your photos to the Nintendo Switch album.
[71:00.68]No.
[71:03.52]What is this?
[71:08.91]What happened?
[71:09.63]What happened?
[71:12.21]That looks bad.
[71:20.73]What's the point of that cutscene?
[71:25.44]It was just animated in like CG and stuff.
[71:29.22]When you get near that field of flowers, I picked up an incredibly strong energy reading.
[71:35.69]Its source seemed to be moving too, if only slightly.
[71:39.01]Which suggests that we've got here is... An Illumina Pokémon!
[71:46.89]We can't be sure yet, but I suspect so.
[71:49.31]I wonder why it showed up.
[71:50.23]Did you do anything special?
[71:52.31]I also doubt that it appeared when it did by chance.
[71:56.62]I think you should be the one to investigate the area where that reading is coming from.
[72:01.66]Oh, I want to go see too.
[72:04.02]You can watch the monitor with me, Rita.
[72:06.32]It's going to be real dangerous.
[72:07.58]It's going to be full of radiation.
[72:09.14]Why do you think we're sending the fucking new guy?
[72:11.80]Anyways, kid, have fun.
[72:24.94]Sending a kid.
[72:25.82]Alright, let's find the Illumina animal.
[72:33.95]Here we go.
[72:34.33]Is this a boss?
[72:36.63]I have to take good photos of the boss?
[72:44.69]Well, that's definitely where the reading was coming from.
[72:48.10]Do you see or hear anything?
[72:55.01]It's quiet.
[73:02.07]Too quiet.
[73:10.37]Look at the camera!
[73:11.12]Look at the camera!
[73:16.22]Are you dumb?
[73:18.54]There's a fucking weird... Land Before Time brontosaurus kid!
[73:23.18]Take the photo!
[73:31.89]Hurry!
[73:39.51]Alright.
[73:43.59]Scan it?
[73:45.43]Don't take a picture of his ass.
[73:47.39]Wait, what am I scanning?
[73:49.36]I need a good picture of him.
[73:50.50]Wait.
[73:55.00]What's he eating?
[73:55.90]He's eating!
[74:09.68]Where's this... I don't know what I'm supposed to be scanning.
[74:32.62]What am I supposed to do with him?
[74:35.42]I don't know.
[74:35.78]We're going to make a big collage.
[74:38.38]These photos suck.
[74:41.41]Wait!
[74:50.19]I don't know what's going to be good.
[74:51.77]Get him running?
[74:56.03]Scan.
[74:58.17]Hold X?
[75:00.39]There's something I can scan somewhere.
[75:08.34]You gonna do anything?
[75:09.06]Oh!
[75:09.58]Oh, is he bad at this?
[75:20.60]Oh, what are you talking about?
[75:21.50]I took... Stop zooming.
[75:29.34]It said get them big.
[75:32.43]The number one thing that Professor Oak told me to do was make sure they're huge in the frame.
[75:47.47]We got a lot to discuss.
[75:48.37]Let's go get your photos evaluated.
[75:53.17]Okay, what's a good one?
[75:57.60]None of these are usable?
[76:01.06]Okay, I guess that none of those are usable.
[76:02.90]How is that not usable?
[76:10.01]That's awesome!
[76:14.40]Look, he's like doing a big sniff.
[76:16.60]Okay, hold on.
[76:21.54]Look at how good that is.
[76:23.96]What the fuck?
[76:24.67]These are perfect.
[76:29.25]What?
[76:30.11]What the hell?
[76:31.41]Why can't I use any of these?
[76:35.31]Why can't I?
[76:38.91]What?
[76:41.94]Reed?
[76:42.34]What do you mean Reed?
[76:43.38]I need to scan him?
[76:45.26]This... This is like a... This is an emote!
[76:59.55]What emote is that?
[77:05.13]Oh, these are all not good.
[77:06.88]It has to be when he's glowing?
[77:12.75]My dog makes that face all the time.
[77:15.09]Okay, well which one of these is the best?
[77:24.48]I mean, probably that one.
[77:29.52]I think I have to use the emote for him.
[77:47.20]Okay.
[77:47.60]It's Meganium.
[77:53.34]Size.
[77:53.90]Pose is great.
[77:55.28]Size is great.
[77:56.06]Direction is great.
[77:56.96]Placement's great.
[77:58.30]That's Diamond.
[77:59.28]I got it.
[77:59.68]I don't need to come back and do this ever again.
[78:15.51]Level 2.
[78:15.75]Got it.
[78:20.13]Look at that, you've hit a new stage in your research.
[78:21.93]Keep an eye out for changes.
[78:24.73]So I have to go back there and take a picture when... the animal does something different and does a new pose.
[78:31.45]I need to go take a pee and play Pac-Man.
[78:41.10]No, I'm not doing that yet.
[78:42.08]I'm playing this.
[78:43.02]I like this.
[78:45.66]I'm invested for the time being.
[78:51.28]Everybody hates Pokémon all of a sudden.
[78:53.10]Everybody hates Pokémon?
[78:54.19]I thought this was like everyone's favorite fucking franchise.
[79:05.79]Well, I need that one.
[79:12.72]I need this.
[79:23.53]Alright, massive blur.
[79:33.51]Go right there.
[79:34.31]Okay.
[79:42.19]Why even... A bit unusual.
[79:48.14]Good.
[80:02.85]Okay, cool.
[80:03.63]Let's go.
[80:04.05]We got a new filter?
[80:07.27]Wait, new filter?
[80:10.43]Literally, new filter.
[80:11.59]Literally.
[80:18.56]We like Attack on Titan, Boomer.
[80:22.26]I keep doing Armin's voice.
[80:24.41]You don't think I'd like it?
[80:25.33]That was amazing.
[80:27.43]Wasn't it gorgeous?
[80:28.17]Wasn't it huge?
[80:28.83]And it was saying something.
[80:31.35]Easy there, Rita.
[80:32.01]Take a deep breath.
[80:33.95]Who's talking?
[80:34.69]You were practically dancing, Professor.
[80:36.77]Ahem.
[80:38.93]Moving on.
[80:40.28]There's no doubt about it.
[80:41.36]That Meganium was an Illumina Pokémon.
[80:46.00]They're all fucking weird names.
[80:47.14]Like, I... An Illumina?
[80:52.94]Is it Illumina?
[80:54.19]Illumina?
[80:55.31]It's not Illumina.
[80:56.11]It's Illumina.
[80:57.71]It's an Illumina Pokémon.
[81:02.05]Bright animal.
[81:03.11]Done.
[81:08.65]Illiterate Andy.
[81:11.07]Sound it out.
[81:12.03]Illumina.
[81:13.81]Illumina Pokémon.
[81:16.89]That's too much.
[81:17.68]That's too much to say.
[81:20.16]Illumina Pokémon.
[81:22.68]Illumina Pokémon.
[81:24.10]That's seven syllables.
[81:25.54]To get across literally.
[81:26.70]Bright dog.
[81:32.32]Bright Dino.
[81:35.38]I just made it so much easier for you.
[81:43.65]Aluminum.
[81:45.97]Aluminum?
[81:47.53]Illumina?
[81:48.81]It's Illumina.
[81:49.99]Illumination.
[81:52.26]Illumination.
[81:54.60]I'm sorry.
[81:54.94]Let me do that better.
[81:56.74]Illumination.
[82:02.20]They have distinctive patterns and to glow with unusual light.
[82:07.94]Minion voice, you're done.
[82:09.16]What do you mean I'm done?
[82:12.32]I'm done?
[82:12.88]What do you mean I'm done?
[82:18.51]Minion voice, you're done.
[82:20.67]It's over for you.
[82:22.35]Oh, shit.
[82:23.05]Career over.
[82:34.36]Alright, let's pick up this conversation from here tomorrow.
[82:43.77]I really thought this was a career-ending stream.
[82:46.83]I thought that, like, my fly was down and that, like, I was in deep, deep shit.
[82:53.46]This is probably a frame grab you could take.
[82:56.71]of me looking down and having like that half second of like panic on camera you could it's I stream at 60 FPS you could probably find one frame where it's just like oh my god he thinks he's naked here's the thing I've been preparing to launch an ecological survey spanning the entire lentil region
[83:22.98]No sooner had you arrived than we suddenly found an bright dog.
[83:26.74]You think there's a connection, Professor?
[83:29.44]I can't be sure yet.
[83:31.40]But fascinating things are bound to happen if you come with us.
[83:36.38]Oh, you know, maybe.
[83:39.08]For a scientist, you sure can be vague sometimes, Professor.
[83:42.88]Still, I think it's a good idea.
[83:49.49]I'll be way more fun.
[83:51.17]It'll be way more fun with you along.
[83:55.85]Ready to officially join our research team?
[83:57.57]Wait, I haven't been on the team the whole time?
[84:05.40]I accept!
[84:05.86]Oh!
[84:23.89]It's like you were born to wear it.
[84:26.75]What are we waiting for?
[84:27.33]Adventure awaits.
[84:29.26]Not to rain on your parade, Frida.
[84:31.72]But I need to get a couple more things ready first.
[84:35.34]Oh, come on.
[84:37.24]Just a little bit longer, alright?
[84:38.46]I promise it'll be worth the wait.
[84:40.82]I'll explain next time you're headed out to do some research.
[84:49.69]Sounded like Deku from My Hero Academia.
[84:53.43]it did hmm oh it's really wild well I wonder who's gonna win this tournament is that that's not no it's not you officially joined the lentil region you officially joined the lentil region research team alright let's go stop talking about anime
[85:24.11]You guys are talking about it.
[85:24.97]I just said literally one word.
[85:28.01]Now that you're a full-fledged team member, I have something for you that'll come in handy.
[85:31.88]Food on your trips.
[85:34.96]Are they not feeding me?
[85:35.98]Does this guy get one apple?
[85:43.32]Oh, by the way, I forgot I haven't been feeding either of you.
[85:48.22]Here's an apple.
[85:49.06]It's been four days.
[85:49.88]Is it just me or have you been getting me to do a lot more of the work lately, professor?
[85:55.41]Well, time to explain like the great assistant I am.
[85:57.29]He's gone.
[85:57.71]What happened to him?
[85:59.79]What happened to him?
[86:00.29]Is he alright?
[86:01.45]This is a f- a f- This is a fluff fruit.
[86:07.84]They grow here.
[86:08.48]It's an apple.
[86:09.30]Why can't you just say apple?
[86:11.72]This is my problem with this whole universe.
[86:14.18]Why can't you just say apple?
[86:16.36]This is a fluff fruit.
[86:18.34]They grow here in the lentil region.
[86:20.38]They're sweet and tasty.
[86:21.28]It's like they're afraid to get copyright infringement on apple.
[86:25.39]And like pears and grapes and stuff.
[86:27.05]I don't understand.
[86:28.49]They're sweet and tasty and they make a great snack for Pokémon.
[86:32.03]They may look just like regular apples, but they're way lighter and softer.
[86:37.13]Oh, so they're a Macintosh.
[86:39.45]My favorite.
[86:39.89]You could probably make a Pokémon's day if you toss it one of these.
[86:46.40]Let's get you some practice.
[86:53.60]Macintosh is the best.
[86:54.60]Yes, it is.
[86:55.50]Okay.
[86:56.54]They like them?
[86:57.54]I can aim it?
[87:24.42]Oh, I'm going for it.
[87:25.64]I'm going for a skull.
[87:27.81]Why is it the first thing I want to do?
[87:28.83]I don't know.
[87:34.37]I'm trying to hit him in the head.
[87:35.25]Is he okay?
[87:42.66]I hit him in the face.
[87:47.58]I wound up throwing an apple at him.
[87:50.52]I didn't kill him.
[87:51.14]He's alive.
[87:58.56]Can I just get in there with an apple?
[88:01.12]That would suck.
[88:03.02]Those things are dense and they're kind of heavy.
[88:12.30]You should try testing out Fluffroot and taking some more photos in the meantime.
[88:19.96]The professor says there are all kinds of ways to use it.
[88:23.58]Finished explaining, I see.
[88:24.50]Thanks, Rita.
[88:25.90]I've got one more thing to tell you about.
[88:28.40]You never know what's going to happen in Imaginopolis.
[88:30.66]So if you ever need any help, just click me.
[88:34.38]Here we go!
[88:35.08]I thought it would be handy to have a quick way to share what we see and learn in the field.
[88:46.41]Are you too familiar with Len Talk?
[88:50.61]You're the Ted Bundy of Twitch.
[88:52.33]Get out of here.
[88:53.03]Ban that person for at least a day.
[88:55.47]I don't want to see that person's name for a week, okay?
[88:58.05]Two weeks.
[88:59.02]Three weeks.
[89:01.26]Are you familiar with that?
[89:02.14]Oh, what are you talking about?
[89:03.28]Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[89:07.18]No, you want to be... Make me Bozo the Clown, not Ted Bundy.
[89:13.60]Bozo the Clown like trips over stuff.
[89:15.72]And like... Hits his head on the wall and makes noises and stuff.
[89:19.26]Ted Bundy is a serial killer.
[89:22.46]I'm more like Bozo the Clown than I am Ted Bundy, okay?
[89:26.96]Please.
[89:36.23]This is... Bozo the Serial Killer.
[89:42.55]This is just like that person that somebody asked me.
[89:44.93]They were like, hey, dude, like, tell me what you do when you're not streaming.
[89:48.30]So, like, I can prove that you're not a serial killer.
[89:51.26]And it's like, what the fuck do you want me to say?
[89:54.27]How do you...
[89:56.37]We have, like, the things that we do on a regular basis for us to give ourselves, like, time passing in our brains.
[90:04.26]I don't know what I do.
[90:06.62]Like, for, like, a four to six hour period during the day.
[90:09.36]I, I don't know, sit around on the couch?
[90:12.61]Watch, like, TV?
[90:14.55]Work on stuff?
[90:16.05]Who remembers every second of their life?
[90:36.35]I'm pretty sure that you're the Zodiac Killer.
[90:38.51]No, I'm not.
[90:40.69]I was not born.
[90:42.72]How could I be the Zodiac Killer if I wasn't alive in that time period?
[90:47.84]I can use it to say... Alright, let me pay attention to the video game.
[91:02.55]I'm having a lot of fun playing animal pictures.
[91:08.34]Look for Len Talk messages in the top right of the screen at the research camp and elsewhere.
[91:11.86]They ought to help.
[91:18.25]I'm going to be so pissed off if Jerma actually ends up being a murderer.
[91:24.41]Don't worry, because that's not happening.
[91:27.49]You don't have to worry about that.
[91:29.03]Let me ease your mind for a second.
[91:31.43]Don't spend more than three bites of Captain Crunch wondering if I have killed someone.
[91:40.71]I haven't.
[91:41.07]I can alleviate that.
[91:41.95]Oh, what's this?
[91:54.43]Ooh.
[91:54.57]I'm going to get to this spot next to that big tree.
[92:04.90]Okay.
[92:05.12]I can understand like, okay, here's the first bite.
[92:10.97]I wonder if I've ever killed anybody.
[92:16.59]Second bite.
[92:20.29]No, no, whatever.
[92:21.17]This is weird for me.
[92:22.23]Okay.
[92:22.51]Time to move on with my day.
[92:23.46]Done.
[92:28.17]I get it.
[92:28.61]You can maybe think that you could have these little like, oh, what ifs?
[92:32.75]Shouldn't last that long.
[92:37.01]A terrific yawn.
[92:40.03]I wonder what it looks like when a Torterra yawns.
[92:42.47]Aren't you curious?
[92:43.11]Okay, so I got to get one of them yawning.
[92:47.61]Sometimes florges seems to gather natural power from its surroundings.
[92:51.71]You mind getting a photograph of this striking behavior?
[92:53.67]I think I already got that.
[92:57.50]Have you seen which Pokémon is scorching these fruits?
[93:01.62]Catch him doing it.
[93:02.32]Okay.
[93:03.10]Alright.
[93:03.54]Let's go for it.
[93:06.48]What happened to this picture?
[93:10.95]Noteworthy behavior.
[93:17.95]Whose is this?
[93:21.81]Are you sending me this photo?
[93:26.79]deep fried what is alright I'm going back to the research facility okay fluff fruit and scans can help you set up all kinds of photos don't be shy okay so I need to go take a picture of who's doing that who's scorching the fruits
[93:59.51]Please play Pac-Man, dude.
[94:00.47]Holy shit.
[94:01.28]It's been an hour and a half.
[94:03.44]I'm gonna be here for a while.
[94:04.68]Okay, let's throw fruits.
[94:09.24]Come get it!
[94:14.40]Eat it!
[94:17.38]Why did I take so long to do that?
[94:18.50]Did I get it?
[94:29.80]He's pissed.
[94:30.20]Wait, he thinks he did it.
[94:31.37]He thinks the buffalo did it.
[94:32.51]Are they going to fight?
[94:33.09]Okay, hold on.
[94:43.23]I need to catch whoever does this in the act.
[94:48.28]Oh, that was so cute.
[94:52.00]Oh, holy shit.
[94:52.94]That was cool, too.
[94:55.84]Hey.
[94:56.68]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[94:57.31]Come back.
[95:01.39]Here we go.
[95:04.23]Who's doing this?
[95:15.34]Did somebody come do this?
[95:24.18]I gotta catch somebody in the act.
[95:37.59]Hello?
[95:37.91]Did he already do it?
[95:54.76]I'm just throwing- I'm just throwing apples at birds.
[95:59.50]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[96:08.02]Ooh.
[96:09.10]Stay right there.
[96:09.62]Come get that.
[96:14.68]Oh, don't eat it yet.
[96:15.44]Wait.
[96:19.18]Look at... Oh, he's got a bunch of snacks.
[96:20.69]That's such a good photo.
[96:22.67]He's like, I'm hoarding these apples.
[96:36.58]Something scannable?
[96:43.03]What can I scan?
[96:44.77]Oh.
[96:46.43]Alright, that's a, uh, a fruit.
[96:55.46]Oh, please!
[96:58.44]No shit, I didn't scan them.
[97:08.53]What just happened?
[97:30.22]Oh wait, I have to get her doing that thing.
[97:31.66]Here it comes.
[97:40.57]Do it!
[97:44.87]Look at how many other Pokémon are in the... Do the thing!
[97:48.43]Do the thing!
[97:49.43]Do the thing!
[98:06.68]Eat apples?
[98:10.70]Whoa.
[98:10.92]Okay, got it.
[98:19.97]This is a less violent on-rails shooter.
[98:26.15]Well, it's a non-violent on-rails shooter.
[98:36.91]Okay.
[98:38.75]Some of those are going to be really good.
[98:50.45]The apple flying.
[98:52.32]The apple hitting the head.
[98:53.68]Really fist.
[99:01.12]This is a great chain of events.
[99:05.24]I like this one.
[99:06.32]Or this one.
[99:11.52]Oh, that one sucks.
[99:14.16]What is this of?
[99:18.53]Is there an animal in this one?
[99:20.25]I guess.
[99:28.35]What?
[99:30.01]What?
[99:31.87]Are you honestly telling me this is not at least two stars?
[99:35.67]That's an incredible photo.
[99:45.66]How is this photo better than this one?
[99:57.11]Star is Poe's rarity.
[100:01.79]I think this is the one right here.
[100:02.77]Yeah, what the hell is this?
[100:17.57]I mean, this one's perfect right here.
[100:21.28]Let's get a good, like, just front, right in the front.
[100:31.50]Ours is what pose they're in.
[100:32.40]It has nothing to do with quality.
[100:37.09]I can't even see the Pokémon here.
[100:43.00]I like how he reads comments but doesn't process what they say at all and then proceeds to not understand.
[100:47.92]Welcome to every single day of my life in high school.
[100:51.67]Like, does reading comprehension?
[100:53.03]I would just read?
[100:53.65]I could read very well, but the text, every paragraph I would go down, the paragraph before it was invisible ink and would just disappear.
[101:05.90]I would only be able to comprehend, like, the current, like, one paragraph I was in.
[101:10.83]And it just, it was disappearing.
[101:12.37]The book was disappearing behind it.
[101:22.83]I can do better than that.
[101:25.65]That's a really good photo.
[101:28.55]Direction placement.
[101:30.93]That's, yeah, diamond.
[101:31.71]There we go.
[101:33.60]Here we go, alright.
[101:34.28]I got diamond, one star.
[101:36.76]Diamond, two star.
[101:41.30]This is gonna be diamond.
[101:44.41]Yeah.
[101:45.41]Oh yeah.
[101:46.47]Yeah, nice, alright, good.
[101:51.59]ADHD Andy or Idiot Andy?
[101:53.43]Pick your poison.
[101:54.29]I think it's Ad- I'm not an idiot.
[101:58.37]I would say I'm not an unintelligent person.
[102:01.23]I just have trouble paying attention to things.
[102:11.42]Retry?
[102:15.54]Oh, yeah.
[102:15.86]Alright.
[102:16.16]So I need to... I got to figure... I got to take a picture of the scorch rabbit.

[103:15.88]Shit!
[103:17.72]I got that same one again.
[103:18.82]Yeah, I did the same exact thing.
[103:21.64]Alright, where is this guy?
[103:22.58]Holy shit.
[103:29.05]Whoa!
[103:29.21]Whoa!
[103:31.89]Is he doing that?
[103:34.59]You doing that?
[103:42.03]It's you doing that.
[103:42.78]I got it, right?
[103:52.52]Wait, something else.
[103:58.42]I've already seen the crystal balloon.
[104:01.72]Okay, now I have to get... What was the other one?
[104:08.12]I want to get as many birds over here as I can.
[104:12.08]Shit.
[104:18.79]That's kind of good.
[104:23.59]No, I want to throw.
[104:32.25]That was awesome!
[104:32.99]Do it again!
[104:33.39]Okay, I have to be ready for... What was the other one?
[104:44.98]There was two other photos to get.
[104:53.89]Alright, scan.
[104:55.61]Wait, hold on.
[105:01.41]That's a good one.
[105:02.76]That's a great one.
[105:11.44]Where's that thing?
[105:12.28]Up here, right?
[105:17.25]Whatever.
[105:21.07]Can.
[105:24.25]Where is it?
[105:30.24]Eat that apple.
[105:37.80]Cute.
[105:38.46]Really cute.
[105:45.78]Okay, this is it.
[105:46.32]I'm gonna do that, the power thing, right?
[105:52.45]I'm gonna do it?
[106:01.49]Throw an apple through the hoop.
[106:04.15]Really?
[106:04.29]Really?
[106:10.30]I need to do that spin move.
[106:15.48]Do the spin.
[106:23.41]Do the spin move.
[106:32.82]Why won't you do it?
[106:46.40]You're dumb.
[106:48.64]Don't say that.
[106:56.60]Don't throw and don't scan.
[107:00.23]That's way better.
[107:00.89]Yeah, I'm going to take this one.
[107:04.95]What's the two that I have so far?
[107:06.55]Oh, yeah.
[107:07.97]The three angry heads.
[107:10.95]Which one's better, though?
[107:13.74]Probably that one.
[107:18.62]Whoa.
[107:20.96]Oh, shit.
[107:22.78]That one.
[107:23.86]That's right in the act.
[107:28.62]That's the one right there.
[107:29.40]I mean, I'm just going to use it because it's a three star, right?
[107:42.73]I do have the really cool ones with Magikarp.
[107:44.29]Ooh.
[107:44.49]Ooh.
[107:47.04]Which one's better?
[107:47.54]This one's more centered, but this one looks more interesting.
[107:50.93]Probably this one.
[107:54.63]That's really cool.
[107:57.97]This one.
[108:04.00]Alright, let's go for it.
[108:16.45]Hey, Mr. Elbertson, I stopped by earlier to drop off your Nobel Prize, but you weren't home.
[108:20.05]Congrats on the award for academic excellence.
[108:22.03]Thanks.
[108:25.69]That's definitely... That's diamond.
[108:28.09]You got an apple in there.
[108:28.83]You have another Pokémon in there.
[108:29.77]They look interesting.
[108:31.55]Yeah.
[108:32.49]That's it.
[108:32.85]That's going to be... There it is.
[108:34.55]Oh.
[108:36.59]Better than the last one.
[108:43.73]Yep.
[108:47.14]Alright, there we go.
[108:47.78]There's, uh... There's diamond.
[108:54.39]I can see how this game could be very addicting.
[109:00.71]You're a VTuber now?
[109:01.75]What are you talking about?
[109:05.49]How am I a VTuber?
[109:13.42]That's good, too.
[109:14.44]Oh, what?
[109:20.06]Guy in the corner.
[109:21.24]Oh, okay.
[109:25.16]That one is not better than this one.
[109:28.52]What?
[109:29.70]How is that a better picture?
[109:31.06]I guess I'm going to hold on to it.
[109:43.33]That's a good magic cap.
[109:47.65]Get it in there.
[109:55.81]This one might be a little better.
[109:57.07]No.
[109:57.25]I mean, it's a cooler picture, but it's not better.
[110:00.47]Get it in the scrapbook.
[110:16.76]I guess I'll take this one.
[110:22.21]Did you like the Departed?
[110:23.79]Oh my god, I love the Departed.
[110:25.19]Is that a new Pokémon?
[110:36.10]I don't know.
[110:38.66]Your photo dex is filling up.
[110:39.84]Remember to check what Pokémon you're missing photos for now and then.
[110:42.84]Yeah.
[110:42.94]I don't want to keep any of those photos.
[110:45.48]Alright, return to camp for a second.
[110:47.78]I want to see where I fulfilled something, right?
[110:54.37]Hope you're having fun.
[110:55.29]I actually am.
[110:55.93]This is fun.
[110:57.09]I like this.
[110:58.19]What can I do in the lab?
[111:08.96]This is the professor's lab.
[111:10.56]Not that it's your first time here, of course.
[111:12.84]This is where the professor does his research and works on mechanical stuff.
[111:16.12]Actually, he pretty much lives here.
[111:19.27]Let me give you a quick rundown of what you can do here.
[111:21.85]That server over there is where we store our research work.
[111:26.07]There are a few things you can do with all that data.
[111:28.85]First, you can check your photodex.
[111:32.11]That's the encyclopedic record you're building with the photos you're taking.
[111:38.53]Isn't it cool getting to put together your very own photodex?
[111:44.30]we said what would you say this game um asking what would I say about it do I like it I think this game and it speaks to uh the photographer in in all of us I'm speaking very like advertising aren't I next there's your space personal photo album and adventure milestones
[112:10.85]Your album is for photos you want to keep but not put in your photo decks, yeah?
[112:13.55]You can edit your album photos in some cool ways too.
[112:16.53]Am I forgetting anything?
[112:18.15]Anything else I'm supposed to tell?
[112:21.62]Did you cover what we can do in the internet?
[112:25.02]Oh yeah, that was it.
[112:26.46]If you use the online internet feature, you can see photos from players all around the world.
[112:31.75]If you really like a photo, you can tell the photographer a nice job by giving the photo a little digital medal.
[112:36.93]They're called sweet medals.
[112:39.79]Give all you want.
[112:40.43]People love getting them.
[112:42.81]That's right.
[112:43.17]You can also see other photographers' rankings in each score category.
[112:46.45]I think that's everything.
[112:49.67]I'm sure you'll figure it all out quick.
[112:51.81]Reddit gold.
[112:57.56]Giving out Reddit awards.
[112:59.04]That's funny.
[113:06.63]I don't give a shit about it either.
[113:14.36]Okay.
[113:17.62]So we got some stuff going on, right?
[113:19.54]What do I need?
[113:19.94]I need to get this one and a terrifying yawn.
[113:24.80]Okay, at night, I need to get the turtles yawning.
[113:30.82]I know you are a Redditor, Jeremy.
[113:34.89]I use the website sometimes, okay?
[113:36.45]Is that, like, a problem for a lot of you?
[113:38.79]Alright, I need to get the turtle yawning.
[113:45.26]Like apples?
[113:50.25]Not really.
[114:12.49]Wait, does this guy like fruit?
[114:21.21]That's the first time I got a picture of his face.
[114:30.50]These are cool.
[114:32.56]Those are good.
[114:33.04]It was him taking a shower or something.
[114:35.37]You eat apples?
[114:42.19]That was kind of cool, too.
[114:46.77]Oh, missed that one.
[114:47.69]It's okay.
[114:53.91]What?
[114:54.15]What?
[114:54.33]What?
[114:54.51]What?
[114:57.91]Noises are coming from this.
[114:58.96]Oh, yeah.
[114:59.30]Okay, ready?
[115:09.52]Get out of there.
[115:14.88]Alright, here we go.
[115:16.26]A turtle yawning.
[115:16.92]Is it a yawn?
[115:23.90]Wake up!
[115:27.42]Come on, be just like that pig in that YouTube video that smells the cookie and goes like...
[115:39.60]Wake up!
[115:41.62]Yawn?
[115:43.14]There it is.
[115:43.46]I got it.
[115:44.74]You want to do it one more time?
[115:55.11]Oh, fine.
[115:55.67]I got it.
[115:58.27]What else did I have to do?
[116:10.05]You like apples?
[116:13.67]That's going to be kind of cool.
[116:18.74]Whoa, this is the cutest thing ever.
[116:42.01]Is it mad?
[116:42.37]Okay, I gotta... We gotta get an apple here.
[116:50.74]Okay.
[116:50.98]Okay.
[116:51.40]Okay.
[117:02.74]It was rude.
[117:11.19]What?
[117:11.37]What?
[117:17.78]Ooh, this is cute.
[117:20.42]This is very cute.
[117:21.60]I don't want to wake him up.
[117:28.27]This is cool.
[117:29.01]This is very cute.
[117:31.05]I mean, like, super cute.
[117:38.20]Got it.
[117:45.28]Zooming Andy.
[117:47.51]Yes.
[117:47.81]I want my subjects to be in frame.
[117:56.51]Okay.
[117:57.29]We got one star and that's a better picture.
[118:07.14]You can see everything.
[118:07.84]Alright.
[118:13.02]Which one of these is the best?
[118:13.92]Probably one of these.
[118:20.08]I like that one.
[118:21.88]Or this one.
[118:22.30]He's on the ground just creeping.
[118:23.80]I like that one too.
[118:26.32]He's thinking.
[118:27.38]We need one star.
[118:28.84]We'll do this one.
[118:29.89]That one.
[118:40.01]First one I have is much better.
[118:44.85]Where's the yawning one?
[118:49.49]That's yawning.
[118:50.49]That's yawning, right?
[118:55.13]I love that one.
[118:56.53]This is him yawning.
[118:57.71]I need this one.
[119:06.58]Let's get it in the book.
[119:08.30]Um... I don't know.
[119:19.92]Probably... Probably one?
[119:21.76]Okay, that's... Is this one better than the other one?
[119:32.87]Probably not.
[119:33.47]I need a two star.
[119:36.11]That one's fine.
[119:36.61]Let's do this!
[119:49.98]This is a really good picture.
[119:50.88]Come on.
[119:52.20]Size, placement.
[119:54.20]Yeah, there it is.
[119:58.98]He's pogging.
[120:04.24]I feel like this is probably a better photo.
[120:08.14]No?
[120:09.62]I guess not.
[120:11.20]I think that's much better.
[120:12.81]It's his eyes and face.
[120:22.21]Gold.
[120:22.49]That's it.
[120:22.83]I don't even know.
[120:27.80]Is it a Caterp?
[120:28.76]Is it a Caterpie in this video?
[120:33.16]Apparently there is.
[120:33.98]Alright, this is the big ticket item here.
[120:44.81]That's a golden four star diamond.
[120:51.78]Ain't gonna find a photo like that ever again.
[120:54.10]Place it in there.
[121:01.79]I like this Hoothoot photo.
[121:07.07]Gold?
[121:08.35]Mm-hmm.
[121:10.93]Just gotta get it in the book.
[121:17.45]Digimon digital monsters.
[121:19.23]Digimon digital monsters.
[121:21.43]Digital monsters.
[121:24.70]Research level 2.
[121:30.44]I thought they were animals.
[121:32.46]They are.
[121:32.74]Okay, what are the... I have to go back to the boss monster thing.
[121:46.99]The love of entertainment.
[121:48.11]Stop zooming in.
[121:48.94]No, I'm going to... Look, I'm going to take my photos away.
[121:51.38]I'm going to take them and they're good.
[122:01.60]That looks like a dog.
[122:02.30]That was a regular dog.
[122:03.18]I told you it was a dog.
[122:17.11]This is Todd.
[122:19.76]He's a professional Pokémon photographer.
[122:22.30]His work takes him all over the world.
[122:25.90]Are you the one that caught a bright dog on camera?
[122:29.10]Way to go.
[122:29.52]That's a big deal.
[122:30.40]Todd, did you bring what I asked you to?
[122:34.61]Sure did.
[122:35.21]You're a lifesaver.
[122:37.15]Now we'll finally be able to set out.
[122:40.83]Is that a friend of yours, Professor?
[122:43.27]An old travel companion, to be precise.
[122:46.63]He's been helping me plan our big survey of lentil, too.
[122:50.73]No kidding.
[122:53.55]Oh, is that the new pod you put together?
[122:55.09]Reminds me of the good old days.
[122:58.51]But hey, let me see those Illumina Pokémon photos.
[123:07.72]Wow, you've really got an eye for this.
[123:11.30]Hey!
[123:11.86]Huh?
[123:15.73]What the fuck is this?
[123:27.26]So you're the new teammate, huh?
[123:29.38]I'm Phil, Todd's number one student.
[123:32.44]Easy there, Phil.
[123:35.06]I'm tempted to take part in this big ecological survey myself, but I have another idea.
[123:42.05]How about I send Phil with you instead?
[123:45.84]I'm fine with that if you are, Todd.
[123:49.32]Yes, awesome.
[123:51.34]You can be my stand-in for now.
[123:53.72]But don't forget, I'll need that badge back eventually.
[123:56.10]Well, fine.
[123:58.52]But if I take a super cool photo, I get to keep the badge.
[124:03.24]Please stop this shit Todd voice.
[124:04.92]Why?
[124:05.18]Is it making you don't like it?
[124:07.33]Making you feel a certain way?
[124:09.23]That's what he sounds like.
[124:14.29]That's what he sounds like.
[124:18.82]What is that?
[124:20.00]I don't know, I thought that was chin armor.
[124:22.12]I thought he was wearing a fucking necklace.
[124:23.74]Ooh, cool.
[124:42.94]I'm just pretending.
[124:43.60]Okay, I thought it was a new area, but it's our camp and I wasn't paying attention, so I just wanted to make you think I thought it was cool.
[124:50.42]I wasn't paying any attention.
[124:51.57]They're talking about this is where we are right now.
[124:58.19]This would be our first destination.
[125:04.31]Why are we starting there?
[125:06.43]I've detected a spot there with high energy readings.
[125:09.10]The NEO-1 should be able to teleport to it.
[125:13.68]This island showed up in the travel log, right?
[125:17.18]It certainly did.
[125:18.36]Captain Vince wrote that he saw a glowing Pokémon there too, in fact.
[125:22.71]Come on already, let's get this survey started.
[125:26.67]Fair enough.
[125:27.17]Enjoy your first in a century adventure into the wilds of Lentil.
[125:37.28]Alright, what else?
[125:38.79]Hoothoot's hidden foot.
[125:40.83]Have you ever seen Hoothoot's other foot?
[125:42.87]You should try to get a photo of it.
[125:48.03]Um... Not now.
[125:54.03]New area unlocked.
[125:57.27]Don't make a Warcraft reference.
[125:58.73]Don't make a... Do not make a Warcraft reference.
[126:01.05]Do not say... Open up your M in World of Warcraft and right-click, right-click, right-click, right-click...
[126:08.85]You have to right click like six times to see the world in World of Warcraft.
[126:13.86]It's like zones inside of zones inside of zones inside of countries inside of countries now.
[126:20.96]Look, I'm a Warcraft streamer.
[126:33.88]I've already talked about this.
[126:37.73]It doesn't matter that I've not played WoW in a very, very long time.
[126:43.44]All that matters is I dedicated like two plus years in front of the screen.
[126:50.42]Like 500 days played in WoW.
[126:54.71]It's part of my life.
[126:56.01]Like permanently.
[127:04.81]I got it.
[127:07.02]Wake up!
[127:09.88]They have faces?
[127:10.58]I don't know.
[127:12.90]Whoa, there's a woodpecker.
[127:26.33]Whoa, what is that guy?
[127:28.57]That's Peter Griffin.
[127:30.09]Hey!
[127:33.15]That's Peter Griffin in a costume.
[127:34.37]It is.
[127:49.78]Animal up there.
[127:50.26]Something to scan.
[127:53.92]Crystal bloom.
[127:54.64]A crystal bloom that grows on Vilselvia Island.
[128:02.27]What are you gonna do?
[128:06.65]What are you gonna do?
[128:13.07]Got it.
[128:16.16]Throw shit at him.
[128:23.43]That also could be Peter Griffin in a costume.
[128:31.52]That's my favorite Pokémon.
[128:35.46]His name's Quagmire.
[128:37.04]This is my favorite Pokémon.
[128:38.63]Is this one cool?
[128:40.11]I like this one.
[128:40.87]That's actually my favorite Pokémon.
[128:53.99]Ah.
[128:56.01]Eggs.
[129:00.37]Everybody come eat those eggs.
[129:10.97]That wasn't even a good picture.
[129:12.11]That was terrible.
[129:18.97]Where is it?
[129:22.61]These ancient ruins are being engulfed by an enormous tree.
[129:28.13]Shit.
[129:35.45]I like this zone.
[129:36.07]This zone's cool.
[129:42.20]Into the water?
[129:43.92]There's going to be like a... There's going to... Whatever.
[129:47.08]There's got to be something in here.
[129:52.40]Come on.
[129:53.02]Go for it.
[129:53.62]He's right there.
[129:54.26]Did I get it?
[130:05.97]Jump out of the water.
[130:06.67]Whoa, you're asleep.
[130:10.51]Oh, shit.
[130:10.95]I didn't even look.
[130:20.59]Missed the yawn.
[130:24.77]That was a cool cat.
[130:29.32]Those are french fries.
[130:35.66]Good picture.
[130:36.30]I liked it.
[130:36.70]Anybody want any fruits?
[130:51.45]That Pokémon is the definition of a no-thoughts head empty.
[130:59.65]They do just kind of sit there with their mouths open, don't they?
[131:01.74]Do you like apples?
[131:07.96]Don't like apples.
[131:15.99]Come on, give me something through the trees here.
[131:30.03]Oh well.
[131:32.67]Shit!
[131:33.21]Come on, really?
[131:42.51]What is that emote?
[131:44.25]What is that?
[131:47.19]It's a mega LOL pizza?
[131:54.76]What is that?
[132:02.20]Uh, it's the only one I have, so take it.
[132:03.76]I mean, that's just better.
[132:10.15]Which one of these is the best?
[132:13.13]Probably this one.
[132:18.33]Aww.
[132:21.72]Wait, this one has another Pokémon in it, though.
[132:23.82]It's probably more coins.
[132:32.12]Oh, it's probably that one.
[132:37.46]Yeah, that one.
[132:41.16]That one.
[132:41.58]No, that one.
[132:42.08]Should I go for the four star?
[132:50.67]I think so.
[132:51.19]If I have an opportunity, why not?
[132:52.97]Yep.
[132:58.77]It's good to me.
[133:02.22]One stars are easy to forget.
[133:03.34]That's true.
[133:04.10]Yeah, it's going to be dog shit.
[133:14.91]I know.
[133:15.11]It doesn't matter.
[133:17.49]Why am I still playing this?
[133:22.85]Well... It's a very simple answer for you.
[133:31.65]Because I'm having fun.
[133:37.13]Stop having fun and not a lot.
[133:47.51]I'm having fun!
[133:48.19]Who cares?
[133:52.29]You need to entertain us.
[133:53.39]I'm having fun and I'm having fun!
[134:03.77]Chat hates games.
[134:17.09]I have, okay.
[134:18.31]Is there a game that collectively everybody here liked?
[134:21.19]I don't know if it's, I don't think so.
[134:24.43]Has there ever been a video game that everyone here collectively actually enjoyed?
[134:31.29]I'm not sure it's ever happened.
[134:37.77]Simpsons hit and run I don't think anybody liked that particular game as much as they like people being angry at it House Flipper.
[134:48.64]Oh, you know what?
[134:49.32]That's true House Flipper is the one using TF2.
[134:54.61]Yeah, I've streamed TF2.
[134:59.33]I Think I stream TF2 like twice four years ago.
[135:01.81]Oh
[135:09.86]I love House Flipper.
[135:11.23]What a great game.
[135:16.15]We all collectively hated Watch Dogs 3.
[135:19.05]Oh yeah, so did I. What's probably the worst game I've ever played?
[135:29.35]Wait, can there be a category of worst games I've ever played that costed like a hundred million dollars to make?
[135:46.04]Ooh, request.
[135:46.66]What is it?
[135:53.98]Most expensive disappointments.
[135:58.32]What have we got?
[136:01.36]It's a Pokémon that's nowhere to be seen most of the time, but at night it sleeps beside Torterra.
[136:05.72]Can you see if you can find it?
[136:06.74]I already got that one, didn't I?
[136:10.29]An afternoon meal.
[136:11.73]Okay, I gotta...
[136:19.79]I have to get a photo of that?
[136:20.83]No, that's just you sending me pictures.
[136:22.23]I don't want them.
[136:23.97]Hard won happiness.
[136:25.43]Pidgeotto's cool, but it's kind of distant.
[136:27.89]Think it'd warm up to you for a fluff root?
[136:31.17]Okay.
[136:33.79]Did you get a picture of the Hoothoot foot?
[136:37.60]And then there's a Pokémon that sleeps in this area.
[136:39.34]Perhaps it would show itself if there were other Pokémon nearby.
[136:43.20]Okay.
[136:46.98]I want to go to that jungle at night.
[136:58.60]Can I do it at night?
[136:59.54]During the day?
[137:00.18]Alright, chow time.
[137:03.48]Making a splash.
[137:08.64]I already did that one.
[137:12.07]I'm a beginner.
[137:12.73]Chow time.
[137:13.31]Wait, who is this?
[137:16.25]How am I getting this?
[137:20.03]Oh, this is somebody's picture.
[137:24.13]Oh, that was pretty cool.
[137:26.65]Sweet.
[137:27.73]Take some Reddit gold.
[137:28.83]Alright, I gotta get a picture of him splashing.
[137:37.36]Report it.
[137:37.98]Why would there be a report function?
[137:41.12]It's on rails.
[137:43.50]What would you possibly be doing to report a photo?
[137:46.34]Good luck.
[137:56.48]Okay.
[137:58.70]Zoom.
[137:59.26]Zoom Andy.
[137:59.94]Zoom Andy.
[138:00.54]Zoom Andy.
[138:01.22]I know.
[138:11.57]Somebody will find a way.
[138:12.73]Zoom.
[138:23.02]Zoom.
[138:25.99]Oh, spider.
[138:26.51]Is this a spider?
[138:27.33]Is this a spider Pokémon?
[138:34.77]I need Peter Griffin's attention.
[138:35.93]Get out of the way.
[138:45.86]It didn't work.
[138:49.00]There are like three spider Pokémon?
[138:50.92]Really?
[138:52.84]It's four of them.
[138:53.58]Are there really?
[139:00.01]Wait, what's that?
[139:00.45]Move out of the way.
[139:03.66]There's something over there.
[139:04.86]Holy shit, it's a snake.
[139:08.24]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[139:17.16]Whoa, it eats the apples.
[139:18.28]Alright, hold on.
[139:18.62]Come over here.
[139:20.04]Do that over here.
[139:26.37]Oh!
[139:27.35]That's a good one.
[139:32.90]He's huge.
[139:33.60]He really is.
[139:34.08]Good pose.
[139:41.88]He posed right for the camera too.
[139:43.42]That's going to be a good one.
[139:50.08]I need one of these guys jumping into the pool.
[140:01.57]That snake was huge.
[140:07.67]Alright, where's that guy jump?
[140:15.93]Should have scanned.
[140:16.49]My own fault.
[140:22.53]Whoa, cool.
[140:23.71]Alright, where's the... I need the lake.
[140:32.02]Got him over here.
[140:32.54]Got the nest over here.
[140:40.87]I don't think SEGA does what Ninten don't, right?
[140:44.11]Come on.
[140:51.90]Look over here.
[141:11.77]SEGA does what Ninten don't.
[141:15.67]The Genesis was fucking absolute dog shit compared to the Super Nintendo.
[141:21.06]It was absolute dog shit in comparison.
[141:25.38]Hey guys, hey, hey, hey, it's me.
[141:26.54]It's me, a SEGA game.
[141:27.48]They all sounded like that.
[141:49.94]Super Nintendo had the cleaner audio.
[141:52.00]And audio is half the way.
[142:05.78]What's over there?
[142:12.74]What's my favorite smell?
[142:15.91]I don't know.
[142:17.10]Favorite smell.
[142:17.86]Um.
[142:20.46]Come on, do something.
[142:31.18]Um.
[142:32.28]Favorite smell.
[142:33.08]I'll tell you what one of my favorite, what my non-favorite smells are.
[142:42.53]Cinnamon apple.
[142:43.97]Cinnamon apple candles.
[142:51.29]Like apple pie candle.
[142:53.37]I don't like it.
[142:53.93]That's perfect.
[142:58.30]Look at that one.
[142:59.34]These both are actually really good.
[143:18.52]All Walmart candles smell the same.
[143:20.61]Ooh, I like that one.
[143:26.69]That one, I like this one too.
[143:31.29]It's probably that one.
[143:43.65]So cute.
[143:45.23]Yeah, I like that one a lot.
[143:46.51]And this one.
[143:48.89]Perfect.
[143:56.43]And jumping into the water, which is the one that... Is it this one here?
[144:01.09]That's what he wants, right?
[144:05.31]Or does he want the actual splash?
[144:15.24]Sandalwood?
[144:16.94]I'm going to do you one up here.
[144:19.44]Oud.
[144:22.24]Oud is one of my favorite scents.
[144:25.94]O-U-D.
[144:26.50]Oud.
[144:32.74]If you've never smelled Oud before, O-U-D.
[144:36.36]It's so, it's so wonderful.
[144:39.53]It's a wonderful scent.
[144:48.19]Nice work.
[144:51.86]perfume the perfume I can't even say this the perfume the perfume you have is oud vanilla and wood that you I mean that's fantastic I love the smell of wood too I love the smell of wood not like a tree like a wooden table
[145:19.74]Alright, there are these dog treats.
[145:21.68]There are these dog bones that they have this, they're made out of wood.
[145:27.95]They have this wood smell.
[145:30.31]They smell incredible.
[145:31.77]They smell unbelievable.
[145:37.01]They're like these wood sticks for dogs and I just want to smell them.
[145:42.21]They smell incredible.
[145:50.03]Better than the last one.
[146:02.33]Good photo.
[146:05.01]Good pose.
[146:05.70]Good size.
[146:06.38]Good direction.
[146:07.00]Good placement.
[146:08.00]I'll take a bronze.
[146:14.38]Nice work.
[146:19.62]No, not savory dog smell.
[146:21.32]I'm talking about... It's like a wooden dog chew thing.
[146:26.69]I don't think it's actually made out of wood.
[146:28.99]It just smells like wood.
[146:30.05]It's this weird fake chemical wood smell.
[146:35.11]That's a great photo.
[146:38.88]I've got two diamonds for the cat.
[146:56.92]I'm not gonna say it.
[147:02.69]It's fucking insane.
[147:04.13]I can't say it.
[147:06.25]It's ridiculous.
[147:10.43]Which one's better?
[147:11.35]I like this one.
[147:20.80]You sniff your...
[147:30.19]You fucking driving me crazy.
[147:40.15]What do you got to report, Professor Mirror?
[147:47.74]I'm not going to say it.
[147:48.58]I'm not going to say it because it's fucked up and I'm not going to say it.
[148:01.36]say it or we leave no I'm not gonna say it I said the first part and it was something about wood I'm not gonna say the whole thing together this is the jungle during the night and photograph a crystal bloom glowing in the dark
[148:32.92]Can you imagine, like... Look at this chat right now.
[148:37.26]Look at this chat room.
[148:40.68]What the hell is happening?
[148:43.02]You guys are going to get me in trouble.
[148:46.97]No, I'm not imagining.
[148:48.29]I'm saying... Stop saying that!
[148:51.39]I need to get this out of here.
[148:53.19]I got to get it out of here.
[148:54.63]Okay, what do I say?
[148:55.63]Shpee!
[148:57.09]Oh, coffee!
[148:58.21]Cheetos!
[148:58.95]Chicken!
[148:59.80]Shpee!
[149:00.68]Shpee!
[149:02.69]Get it out!
[149:03.19]Get it out!
[149:03.91]Get it out!
[149:12.06]Probably the type we're after.
[149:16.76]We'll call it the bright state.
[149:22.04]Do we need to do anything special if we find one?
[149:24.46]Not particularly, just snap a photo of it.
[149:27.09]Your camera can analyze it for you.
[149:31.98]Enjoy the nighttime jungle.
[149:33.34]Nice run.
[149:42.55]In the comfort and safety of its own territory, even the wariest Pokémon will let its guard down to eat a tasty fruit.
[149:49.33]Wow.
[149:54.87]Oh, cool.
[149:56.01]Whoa, how did you get that?
[150:00.96]I am so pro gamer.
[150:07.26]I took this photo.
[150:10.96]How did you get that?
[150:16.78]How did you do this?
[150:36.43]Okay, what are we doing at night?
[150:37.65]I don't know.
[150:46.60]This is so fucked up.
[150:56.59]It's pretty dark out there.
[150:58.15]You might have a hard time finding Pokémon.
[150:59.97]Look for a glowing Cristobloom for me, would you?
[151:06.73]Shit, that was awful.
[151:08.57]Look for a glowing Cristobloom.
[151:15.24]Wee, you started it.
[151:17.38]I did not start it.
[151:18.44]I just told you that I like the smell of my dog's toys.
[151:23.64]I like the smell of my dog's...
[151:26.36]wooden toy.
[151:29.23]He has a toy that's wooden.
[151:31.11]It smells like wood.
[151:32.29]I hate this.
[151:37.24]My dog has a toy.
[151:49.90]It's a stick.
[151:51.66]It came in a package and you open up the package and it's made out of like tree, like wood.
[151:57.75]It's wood.
[151:58.25]There's the spider.
[152:01.73]Spiders like apples.
[152:09.77]Get a photo of a crystal bloom, right?
[152:12.32]That's a crystal bloom right there.
[152:17.18]Oh, oh.
[152:28.06]It has to be glowing?
[152:28.86]Cute.
[152:37.27]Snoozing in the tree.
[152:38.03]It's like Invader Zim.
[152:51.96]Turn and look, turn and look.
[153:00.12]He's eating.
[153:04.08]Show the toy.
[153:05.14]Show the toy.
[153:06.02]I will.
[153:07.20]I will show it.
[153:07.70]I need a glowing crystal.
[153:18.84]Wrong button.
[153:31.95]Ooh, that's cool.
[153:35.01]Can I get them to move?
[153:42.82]That was cute.
[153:48.96]Otto!
[153:49.74]Otto!
[153:50.64]Oh, there's Otto.
[153:54.20]I was not even paying attention.
[153:56.63]Could've got a cool action photo.
[154:05.08]Alright.
[154:05.94]Crystal.
[154:12.95]I hear something flapping.
[154:13.65]Something flapping.
[154:19.51]Good photo.
[154:22.38]Oh, there's this one.
[154:23.82]Alright.
[154:24.02]Throw an apple at it?
[154:24.80]That didn't do anything.
[154:32.83]Wow.
[154:33.89]Wow.
[154:38.80]Wow.
[154:44.78]That's not doing anything.
[154:46.57]Wait!
[154:48.05]Is there one glowing over here?
[154:49.45]There's one glowing over there.
[154:50.45]Move out of the way!
[154:54.33]Move out of the way!
[154:56.01]Move out of the way!
[154:56.47]I want to go in his mouth for the photo.
[155:17.82]Turn.
[155:18.42]You guys like apples?
[155:19.07]You like apples?
[155:34.78]One of those will work.
[155:41.22]Just make the armpit fart noise already.
[155:43.44]Alright!
[155:43.88]Fine!
[155:47.35]That hurt.
[155:47.83]I can't do it.
[156:04.52]I already have one of these.
[156:05.34]This one's way worse.
[156:07.64]Do I have any... Did you hear my mouth?
[156:09.15]It was like... Nothing's going to compare with that one.
[156:12.39]I mean, the sleeping one's cool, but no.
[156:17.58]Alright.
[156:21.82]This is four in the same shot.
[156:23.81]That's probably what they want.
[156:24.77]This is cuter.
[156:29.29]But this one is probably more points.
[156:31.61]Alright.
[156:38.47]I don't have any pictures of this.
[156:42.45]Ah, that one's good.
[156:46.92]This is a picture of him.
[156:54.21]Oh, that one's cute.
[156:55.11]I like this one.
[156:56.83]Looks like he's bouncing on his nose.
[157:03.19]It's this one.
[157:07.68]I got a couple of really good ones here.
[157:09.14]That one.
[157:11.08]That one.
[157:12.14]That one.
[157:14.58]That one.
[157:16.63]I'm going to go with this one.
[157:18.05]And then, uh... Crystal Bloom.
[157:23.10]Glowing.
[157:23.52]Got it.
[157:32.05]These graphics kind of suck.
[157:37.63]Um... I mean, it's a switch, though.
[157:40.75]Nice work.
[157:43.83]Guys, don't you know, Nintendo still bases their graphical power on being like two and a half times more powerful than the GameCube.
[157:59.78]That's a good picture.
[158:05.74]A new discovery.
[158:10.56]Nice work.
[158:11.91]It looks better than sword and shield.
[158:15.48]People didn't like that, did they?
[158:19.02]I've not heard very good things about that.
[158:20.88]I heard people really didn't like it.
[158:21.92]Alright, this is the big one here.
[158:25.86]That's going to be gold.
[158:27.82]Or diamond.
[158:31.41]Diamond.
[158:32.17]Aw, silver.
[158:37.05]Every gen past three is shit.
[158:41.60]I don't even know what Gen 3 is.
[158:46.33]All I know is that I got Pokémon Diamond for the Nintendo DS.
[158:50.87]I don't know why.
[158:51.67]It came out and I just, for some reason, bought it.
[158:54.51]I'd never played a Pokémon game ever before.
[158:58.44]And I played it for about an hour and then I just never played it ever again.
[159:08.26]That's Gen 3.
[159:10.36]I heard Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were the... That's like the best one, right?
[159:16.91]Everybody loves that.
[159:17.87]Isn't that everybody's favorite besides like Green Leaf and Red, whatever?
[159:23.77]That's everybody's favorite.
[159:25.99]That's what I thought.
[159:28.07]That's the first 5k I think I've gotten.
[159:32.78]Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum are all Gen 4.
[159:34.06]Hmm.
[159:39.55]Gen 2 is the best.
[159:44.06]That's Gen 4.
[159:49.40]I simp for 2 and 3, but 4 is objectively better.
[159:53.10]Alright.
[160:06.42]Pokémon sucks.
[160:09.48]That's just in there in the sea of comments.
[160:15.97]Ooh, you registered seven bugs.
[160:23.22]Best Pokémon game is the one you played as a kid.
[160:25.56]You get it.
[160:27.40]You get it.
[160:40.37]So what was the problem with Sword and Shield?
[160:44.54]So every time they do a new Pokémon game, they add another like 150 Pokémon, right?
[160:57.93]True.
[160:58.25]What did I do?
[160:58.79]What did I say?
[160:59.73]Nothing.
[161:00.17]It's perfectly fine.
[161:07.63]They didn't advance the series.
[161:09.58]There was no effort.
[161:13.96]Nothing bad, just literally nothing new.
[161:15.50]Sword and Shield removed a lot of core features.
[161:18.16]They cut half the Pokémon.
[161:23.30]It's boring.
[161:24.16]Oh.
[161:30.66]Those orb things you've been working on, Professor, that's those.
[161:34.07]Ugly, stupid, stinky game.
[161:35.29]Whatever.
[161:36.31]Whatever.
[161:41.22]Now I got you guys talking.
[161:42.44]Now I got you guys interested.
[161:44.80]All I had to say was, what's your favorite Pokémon, Jen?
[161:47.90]And all of you woke up at the same time.
[161:53.65]Somebody asked what my favorite Pokémon was.
[161:56.37]It's very easy.
[161:57.39]It's Mewtwo.
[161:58.69]He's the only one that can talk besides Meowth.
[162:01.31]And he's just stronger and cooler than Meowth.
[162:04.80]It's Mewtwo.
[162:05.30]It's the best Pokémon.
[162:16.57]Lucario can talk.
[162:18.39]No, he can't.
[162:21.19]I suspect it's because different areas of Lentil have distinct types of energy flowing through them.
[162:27.53]For now, I want to see the fruits of your... Oh, wait, he can talk.
[162:30.62]What does he say?
[162:31.14]He says, like... No, not... That's Shadow the Hedgehog.
[162:36.74]Chaos... No, what is it?
[162:39.02]He says something.
[162:44.34]What does Lucario say when he does something?
[162:51.25]All of them can talk.
[162:54.01]Chaos control.
[162:55.13]Yeah, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.
[162:56.59]Lucario says something when he does like a power.
[163:02.29]He just says Lucario.
[163:05.82]No, he talks, doesn't he?
[163:09.34]Lucario says chaos control.
[163:10.96]What?
[163:11.12]What?
[163:12.95]No, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.
[163:29.87]Am I gaslighting myself?
[163:31.67]It's Shadow the Hedgehog, right?
[163:33.17]Oh my gosh, it's so pretty.
[163:39.15]Wow, Lentil's very own light show.
[163:41.71]What did you call it again?
[163:44.02]The Illumina Phenomenon?
[163:47.26]It's interesting how it can occur in both Pokémon and planets.
[163:52.65]You can use these orbs to send Pokémon and Crystal Blooms into the Illumina state for a while.
[164:02.49]When you do, watch for changes in their surroundings.
[164:06.97]You're gaslighting yourself.
[164:08.95]But you guys are, like, helping me.
[164:11.36]I have a blindfold on, and you guys are guiding me around to gaslight myself.
[164:18.29]This is pinned, this is, this is like, what's that, uh, like, there's like a piñata hanging down.
[164:27.18]And you guys, I have a blindfold on, and like, as a joke, you like turned me around and like moved me down like the driveway.
[164:34.42]And you're like, hey, your piñata's right in front of you!
[164:38.15]And I'm like, swinging and just missing and I don't understand.
[164:41.33]And everyone's laughing.
[164:46.11]And it's really funny until I take out the light post and fucking down the driveway.
[164:49.78]And it's real funny now, isn't it?
[164:52.02]Do I have to pay for that?
[164:54.18]Do I pay for that?
[164:55.90]When I take the blindfold off and I fucking hit your mailbox.
[164:58.90]Do I have to pay for that?
[165:00.99]I don't believe I do.
[165:01.85]I don't think so.
[165:07.52]Alright, so now I can turn on those lights.
[165:18.21]Please record yourself doing that in front of a green screen.
[165:20.97]What?
[165:21.39]With like a blindfold saying like, oh, where's the piñata?
[165:27.96]Oh, I'm sad that doesn't already exist.
[165:40.19]Okay, dinner time.
[165:42.91]Sir McFluff loves fluffies.
[165:47.94]This is so cool.
[165:48.90]I like these.
[165:52.82]Dinner time.
[165:53.78]Everybody has them eating the apples.
[165:57.38]That's the meta right now.
[166:00.34]This game is so new that the Pokémon eating apples is the current most upvoted meta.
[166:17.05]I'm going to take a picture of a Pokémon with an apple in front of them.
[166:22.19]And I'm going to try to get them biting into it.
[166:23.85]And I'm going to zoom in.
[166:25.25]And I'm going to put, like, snackies underneath it or something.
[166:30.40]And I bet you that's the highest upvoted thing I have.
[166:32.84]Stop metagaming.
[166:33.84]Why not?
[166:41.95]Alright, what are the requests here?
[166:44.39]I heard a really loud noise and it got me wondering, do you think Arbok ever falls out of his tree while it's sleeping?
[166:50.96]Um, should I try to get a picture?
[166:52.22]Okay.
[166:53.70]Whoa, toucans.
[166:55.44]I haven't seen Hickeypeck flying near Toucanon's nest.
[167:00.62]What do you suppose they're up to?
[167:04.84]That's just a toucan.
[167:07.14]I understand that Pokemons are supposed to be kind of like animals and stuff, but that's a toucan.
[167:12.14]That's not Toucanon.
[167:14.55]That's just a toucan.
[167:18.89]Why can't you just say it's near the toucan's nest?
[167:24.68]It has a gun.
[167:25.30]It has a cannon.
[167:28.40]They're getting lazy.
[167:32.72]A couple, like a golden retriever runs by.
[167:34.56]Oh, that's Goldidio.
[167:39.20]Goldidio.
[167:39.98]That's the one right there.
[167:47.03]Alright, I'll go for it.
[167:47.65]Let's go back during the day.
[167:49.89]I want to try to get the Toucan.
[167:55.75]There's a Corgi.
[168:01.26]Well, here.
[168:02.02]You have to give a little bit of credit, though.
[168:05.92]How hard do you think it is eventually here to create Pokémon for the 15th generation or whatever?
[168:12.97]Ah, shit.
[168:14.65]Okay, we're going to have a little monkey.
[168:17.10]Ah, we already have like five of those.
[168:18.46]Um, but have him have like a weird tail this time.
[168:21.60]We have like 30 moths, but make this moth, ah, make this moth sing.
[168:25.73]Alright, where's this toucan nest?
[168:40.98]I think that guy's awake.
[168:42.18]What the hell is that thing?
[168:43.84]What is that thing?
[168:44.60]What is that?
[168:44.90]That's a rare.
[168:46.85]That was a rare and I just didn't even get a picture of it.
[168:48.36]Look at this guy.
[168:58.38]What the hell is that thing?
[169:01.18]That's a sock.
[169:03.46]Oh, that's not its face!
[169:05.46]That's not its face.
[169:06.56]I thought it was like a big sock puppet.
[169:18.27]Holy shit, he's right next to me.
[169:19.54]Don't be concerned.
[169:21.86]What's that?
[169:32.32]That's the one they were giving away.
[169:33.14]This is the one they were giving away for free, right?
[169:34.56]During the... What was it?
[169:38.25]Not E3.
[169:47.50]That's a whooper watch right there, yeah?
[169:48.90]Okay, where's this toucan?
[169:57.47]I just hit him.
[170:01.35]Where's the toucan nest?
[170:02.37]Okay, go look at the toucan nest.
[170:11.93]Hmm.
[170:12.11]Hmm.
[170:16.34]I don't see a toucan nest.
[170:20.68]Wait.
[170:21.80]Okay.
[170:22.36]There's the toucan.
[170:25.23]What was I supposed to be filming here?
[170:30.89]Whoa.
[170:31.93]Can I get you jumping?
[170:33.85]I want to get you jumping off this.
[170:37.38]He's going to do a jump.
[170:39.82]Jump?
[170:40.90]Holy shit.
[170:41.68]Did I get it?
[170:54.31]What photo am I trying to get here?
[170:55.47]What was I trying to get?
[171:01.95]Oh, Snacky's right.
[171:21.41]It is just a Toucan.
[171:22.17]Yeah, it is.
[171:23.96]You can have other animals in the universe.
[171:25.48]I don't know why they all have to be Pokémon.
[171:33.98]Alright, Jermamites.
[171:34.94]It's that time of the stream again.
[171:35.98]Can we get a wubba lubba dub dub in the chat right now?
[171:38.66]I hope so.
[171:41.16]Yeah, because people are going to really think you're funny or you just got blocked by like 10,000 people.
[171:57.57]Come on, snackies.
[171:59.49]Come on, give me a snackies.
[172:00.59]What about you?
[172:03.98]Will you do a snackies?
[172:08.48]Give me a snackies.
[172:09.58]Here it comes.
[172:10.00]Come on.
[172:12.16]Oh, that's perfect.
[172:13.04]Snackies.
[172:14.68]That's going to be perfect.
[172:15.64]I want that one.
[172:29.14]I still don't understand how this works.
[172:30.55]Probably should have paid attention.
[172:32.63]Eat?
[172:44.72]What do you think?
[172:47.36]Apple?
[172:48.86]Come get it.
[172:49.22]Do cats not like apples?
[172:54.00]I guess not.
[173:03.70]People forget that these Pokémon attack and kill each other out in the wild.
[173:09.46]That's what I was saying.
[173:10.38]They're like cartoons.
[173:11.24]They're not even animals.
[173:21.57]Okay, what am I missing?
[173:24.33]I'm not going to replace that one.
[173:27.46]I mean, that one's kind of funny.
[173:28.84]It's not even the right animal.
[173:34.04]That one's better, but... Yeah, we'll do this one.
[173:39.21]Eh, how could that be possibly better?
[173:40.29]I got the jumping one.
[173:44.37]Aw, what?
[173:49.91]That's not a three star?
[173:55.23]I really thought... I really thought it was that.
[174:00.04]Oh, it fooled me.
[174:01.86]I'm as... I'm a stupid animal.
[174:05.68]That's what that thing is there for.
[174:07.20]It's to scare other animals.
[174:10.30]I fell for it.
[174:11.26]Yeah.
[174:17.91]None of these are as good.
[174:26.04]That's a good one right there.
[174:27.02]That was that one.
[174:31.53]I'm going to have to go with the good one though.
[174:32.99]Actually, this one might be, this one's far better.
[174:35.49]This is a three star, but it's not, it's kind of off center.
[174:37.43]This one's perfect.
[174:39.85]We'll go with the, uh, we'll go with the two.
[174:44.36]Um, this, no, it's not better.
[174:45.96]Here we go.
[174:48.42]Snackies.
[174:49.42]Oh my God.
[174:49.94]Perfect.
[174:50.74]This is, this is the one.
[174:51.50]This is the one that's going to get a thousand upvotes.
[175:05.54]That one's good.
[175:06.38]That one's better.
[175:06.88]That one's better.
[175:08.80]What did... Okay, what did he want?
[175:13.37]What was the actual... I don't know what he's... What did he want?
[175:24.99]He wanted this one.
[175:25.81]Okay.
[175:29.62]And then a Crystal Bloom.
[175:33.12]Cool.
[175:33.24]Cool.
[175:44.45]Cooking tacos while watching this?
[175:45.77]How hot are they?
[175:47.23]Are they going to be hot?
[175:47.93]Or are they going to be mild?
[175:50.97]That determines if you get banned from the channel or not.
[175:53.01]Let's find out.
[175:53.49]That second photo is perfect.
[176:04.97]They're going to be fucking hot.
[176:06.77]Alright.
[176:07.55]Good game.
[176:16.30]Okay, two diamonds.
[176:25.35]Alright, here we go.
[176:27.87]Is this one better?
[176:29.09]Yes, it is.
[176:29.65]Way better.
[176:32.01]Yeah, and we're keeping this one.
[176:33.57]And I mean permanently, because that's the ultimate snackies photo.
[176:42.33]A new discovery.
[176:47.80]Is that the one he wanted?
[176:54.52]Didn't fulfill the request?
[177:00.48]Level three.
[177:11.73]You register 10 species of normal type.
[177:15.35]Okay, save photos to album.
[177:18.40]It's this one.
[177:19.20]Where is it?
[177:21.44]There it is.
[177:23.10]Perfect.
[177:23.80]Re-snap.
[177:26.26]Okay, what do I have with filters?
[177:31.15]What the hell?
[177:40.01]Can't improve perfection.
[177:50.81]Or you can.
[178:01.15]I want to put filters on it.
[178:02.75]Maximum blur.
[178:08.23]That just hurts my head looking at this.
[178:17.60]This hurts my head.
[178:23.12]Too much blur.
[178:23.62]I don't like it.
[178:26.72]Raid song.
[178:27.20]Sing the raid song?
[178:30.02]What happened?
[178:33.54]I think there's a desktop background.
[178:39.10]A raid?
[178:39.52]Who raided?
[178:40.38]Where?
[178:43.63]Where did my last update just from seven days ago?
[178:47.27]What?
[178:49.67]Where's the raid?
[178:52.67]I can't see.
[178:55.11]Who raided?
[178:55.51]You get a raid?
[178:56.91]Thank you.
[178:59.05]Thank you for the raid.
[178:59.93]Whoever it was.
[179:00.89]I can't see.
[179:01.31]Why can I not see this?
[179:01.91]Okay.

[199:51.64]And underneath my nameplate, it says, Derma985.
[199:55.04]And then there's a lower thirds graphics come up that says, The Sus Guy.
[199:58.67]And it has like that face.
[200:01.35]That's like why I got invited.
[200:16.62]And I have to... I have a microphone in front of me.

[200:33.33]Hey, what do you think about this, like, red trash can?
[200:38.98]Don't you think it looks a little sus?
[200:42.38]And then I, like, have to smile and go...
[200:46.91]And everybody in the audience like claps and shit and laughs.
[200:56.04]I don't want that to happen to me.
[201:03.06]Alright.
[201:03.88]Grass is coming up.

[215:32.67]And you put your signature on it.
[215:34.84]He stamped it as his.
[215:39.36]Alright, I've uploaded the photo.
[215:40.66]Go to the internet and check your page.
[215:42.06]What?
[215:42.40]I didn't want you to do that.
[215:53.79]Reddit him.
[215:58.81]He's gonna sell it as an NFT.
[216:07.21]You got a total of one sweet metal- Ooh!
[216:11.10]Somebody sweeted my picture!
[216:21.58]Kombi are very devoted to Vespiquen.
[216:24.58]If you observe them closely, you see that these Pokémon do more than just gather nectar.
[216:28.96]Dull.
[216:31.76]What happened here?
[216:36.39]This is... I want this!
[216:41.89]Why can't I... I want these filters!
[216:43.29]I want this filter!
[216:44.55]I want that!
[216:48.69]How come I don't have those?
[216:50.35]I would do so much better work
[216:59.52]Alright, I can go here at night.
[217:01.38]That's a hit.
[217:03.70]Wait, didn't I take this picture?
[217:04.70]I took this photo.
[217:11.92]I took that photo.
[217:18.38]I heard a really loud noise and it got me wondering, do you think Arbok ever falls out of its tree while it's sleeping?
[217:23.39]I have to pay attention to that.
[217:24.79]Alright, what was this one?
[217:29.39]I already... I took this picture.
[217:30.63]Didn't I get this?
[217:32.17]I see Pik... I see Pikipek flying near Toucanon's nest.
[217:36.37]What do you suppose they're up to?
[217:38.03]I already got a photo of this.
[217:40.59]Alright, we're looking for the big snake falling out of the tree.
[217:45.42]What time of day is that?
[217:46.38]Day?
[217:47.00]It's daytime.
[217:47.50]Alright, we're looking for the snake falling out of the tree.
[218:01.58]Okay, snake falling out of the tree.
[218:03.38]I don't care about anybody else, just the snake.
[218:09.58]Where is he?
[218:17.37]Where is he?
[218:22.09]Falls out of the tree.
[218:22.99]Alright, he's right there.
[218:24.21]He didn't fall out of a tree.
[218:26.79]He's literally right here.
[218:32.79]That was a nighttime mission.
[218:46.48]He's so baked.
[218:59.28]I don't know.
[219:00.27]Somebody pasted something and it was gone instantly.
[219:02.09]I have no idea what you said.
[219:02.91]It was probably a copypasta.
[219:14.92]Okay.
[219:22.38]Jungle at night.
[219:23.01]Looking for the snake falling out of the tree.
[219:31.33]Go check Professor Mirror's hard drive.
[219:35.25]Why?
[219:50.52]Apple?
[219:50.82]Alright, where is he?
[219:54.10]Oh, there he is!
[219:54.56]Does he fall out of the tree?
[220:18.56]I don't think... He does not fall out of the tree.
[220:19.98]Okay.
[220:26.84]Come on, bun sweets.
[220:46.04]I have painful stinging blisters from walking four miles in flip flops today.
[220:49.38]What are you thinking?
[220:56.79]What were you thinking?
[220:58.65]You know the maximum amount of walking time you should do with flip-flops is either slipping them on and off to go to where the sand is at the beach and maybe walk up on the boardwalk somewhere for a little bit.
[221:11.96]Or, in the amount of time it takes to go get your mail from the mailbox.
[221:15.54]How would you do that for four hours?
[221:34.07]You know what?
[221:34.85]Frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive.
[221:36.21]Someone's sleeping down here, too.
[221:48.20]What if it was a really long driveway?
[221:50.24]Alright, was I missing something else here?
[221:56.10]I got it.
[221:56.96]I got the snake.
[222:09.86]Something's going to come out of that ruined door.
[222:12.16]Right?
[222:12.32]It has to be.
[222:13.06]There's something in there.
[222:21.32]An electric eel is going to come out when I put something in there, right?
[222:27.50]You know when an electric eel puts its head out and has that weird, like, bleh?
[222:32.48]They always come out of holes like that.
[222:35.65]Where is everybody?
[222:42.38]What is that sound?
[222:47.07]I miss that every time.
[222:54.74]Oh, that's that guy's photo!
[223:13.62]Wait.
[223:14.54]What's this?
[223:15.88]Who's that?
[223:17.98]Somebody over there.
[223:19.70]Who's acting?
[223:23.36]Oh, it's a whooper.
[223:26.02]You like apples?
[223:30.75]No, he doesn't like me anymore.
[223:36.41]He's pissed.
[223:44.16]What are you still doing awake, woofer?
[224:03.23]Alright, I think I got the photo I needed here.
[224:04.75]Family Guy waiting room.
[224:18.54]I'm zooming in.
[224:19.12]I get the tooltip that says zoom in more frequently.
[224:25.54]I'm doing what the game is telling me to do.
[224:34.98]What Pokémon would taste the best?
[224:38.14]I don't know, one of the birds?
[224:40.80]What if the one is the closest resembling a chicken?
[224:53.51]How do I get these guys to be two?
[224:58.82]Nothing will compare to that photo.
[225:04.34]What the hell?
[225:04.92]I mean, that's clearly what he was looking for.
[225:08.94]Hmm, this isn't better, no.
[225:27.76]You have to knock him out of the tree.
[225:30.47]Threw a few apples at him and didn't do anything.
[225:34.55]Ah, this is a whooper.
[225:36.87]That's a good photo, but wait a minute.
[225:38.05]Look at this one.
[225:40.32]No, it's this one.
[225:43.80]Throw more apples.
[225:48.28]Ancient runes.
[225:54.26]Code on your profile is for this game, not your Switch friend code, you dope.
[225:58.35]Oh, well.
[225:58.71]Nice work.
[226:08.84]I always wanted to eat a Pokémon.
[226:10.98]Why?
[226:11.28]I don't understand why.
[226:14.12]Nice work.
[226:30.66]Everyone didn't see my message.
[226:31.98]I saw that one.
[226:36.74]Let us see the profile so we can upvote everything.
[226:39.96]No, I'm not going to game the system and have my stuff get upvoted.
[226:44.40]You're probably going to get my account banned.
[226:51.37]You want to, like, brigade my profile?
[226:53.55]You're going to get me thrown off of the Pokémon Snap forums.
[227:12.35]Am I still level one here?
[227:13.29]Alright, there we go.
[227:16.35]Present.
[227:17.75]Snapped a total of 500 photos.
[227:19.36]Am I insane or is he just replaying two levels over and over?
[227:28.40]I mean, that's what I have unlocked now.
[227:54.29]Too popular to play games publicly.
[227:56.57]No, I'm not.
[227:58.73]Okay, who needs wings?
[228:03.42]I just heard Dodrio can fly.
[228:05.12]I've never seen one.
[228:07.18]Okay, that's near the end where the owl is.
[228:10.36]And then...
[228:16.55]Go find what motivates the combis to work.
[228:23.32]That's all the requests I have for here?
[228:24.50]Oh, what about complete?
[228:29.18]I haven't even been completing quests.
[228:38.53]Are you kidding me?
[228:44.81]Design 13.
[228:46.92]Oh, that's how you get... Alright, I get it.
[228:48.51]Okay, completed.
[228:54.19]What else do I get?
[229:00.99]Ooh, it's an effect.
[229:03.81]Now I can start actually making cool things.
[229:05.73]Complete.
[229:08.91]Making a splash.
[229:13.50]Oh, I forgot the wooden dog toy.
[229:14.88]That's right.
[229:15.80]I'll go get it after, um, before I play Pac-Man.
[229:17.80]Alright, is this all I have during the night?
[229:26.81]Alright, we gotta take a picture of the dojo real flying.
[229:45.43]Look at the joke tracker right now.
[229:46.93]Market's closed.
[229:53.97]Whoa.
[229:59.22]Oh, right.
[229:59.54]I got to get him doing this.
[230:00.24]I got to get him jumping in the air.
[230:06.54]He goes, whoop, and he jumps up.
[230:11.35]Hey!
[230:11.57]What?
[230:13.29]What?
[230:15.58]What the hell was that?
[230:16.38]That was bizarre.
[230:23.10]That was weird.
[230:23.80]Why did he do that?
[230:24.46]You can jump again?
[230:29.56]Jump.
[230:42.17]Fine, whatever.
[230:45.19]Alright, I need the... I need the Dodrio flying.
[230:51.51]Right near the owl.
[230:56.51]A lot of them.
[230:58.38]What's that?
[230:58.72]That's like a weird planet or something.
[231:01.52]What is that?
[231:01.82]It's a person on a parachute.
[231:05.60]That's somebody on a parachute.
[231:10.35]What is that?
[231:11.47]This pink thing.
[231:14.51]See that?
[231:18.44]Did I miss him flying?
[231:19.44]I think I did.
[231:19.80]Does that count?
[231:25.11]Does that count as flying?
[231:35.43]How did the stream reach negative 5,000?
[231:37.31]Because people are just spamming it.
[231:47.44]I'll meet these.
[231:53.13]I need these.
[232:02.60]That was good.
[232:07.91]That was good, too.
[232:11.33]He's going to fly right over here, and I'm going to get it.
[232:12.91]One, two, three.
[232:17.07]Reap.
[232:25.79]Alright, Dodrio flying.
[232:27.07]Here he comes.
[232:27.49]What's the best Star Wars?
[232:34.80]Um... Empire Strikes Back.
[232:39.36]I'm actually a Return of the Jedi guy.
[232:45.76]My favorite of all the movies because Mark Hamill looks like a stagehand the whole movie.
[232:50.90]My favorite.
[232:59.07]When does he fly?
[233:04.69]This is it.
[233:06.04]Ready?
[233:06.92]Shit.
[233:09.88]Where is he?
[233:10.82]There he is.
[233:11.14]I got it, right?
[233:25.51]Light it up.
[233:29.18]Something is motivating them.
[233:32.08]What's motivating them?
[233:35.88]You?
[233:41.38]You fly at the end?
[233:42.22]I think I got it.
[234:00.89]Jumping counts.
[234:01.49]Good.
[234:02.15]Alright, I got it then.
[234:07.81]I think I completed like three quests here.
[234:12.33]Oh, stupid.
[234:15.60]Stupid.
[234:17.24]I think this... I mean, he just looks weird.
[234:19.16]I don't know.
[234:29.01]I guess this one's better.
[234:33.26]Cell.
[234:33.86]Cell.
[234:37.19]That's a good one here.
[234:38.17]Okay, Dodrio.
[234:38.89]Flying.
[234:45.03]This one is... It's probably this one.
[234:51.37]Ichiyoto?
[234:58.15]Which one did he... Which one did he want?
[235:02.96]I think it's this one.
[235:04.96]Right?
[235:05.96]That one?
[235:15.71]This one.
[235:20.70]Swanna.
[235:22.16]Spencer.
[235:24.18]Okay, Combee.
[235:28.26]Sure, that one.
[235:30.66]I guess I'll take that one.
[235:34.91]Okay.
[235:36.17]Somebody said pick pictures every time, even if you don't need them.
[235:39.21]Because I'm losing out on experience?
[235:43.55]This is free EXP.
[235:50.03]Do an ASMR of you telling us comforted things like I'm proud of you.
[235:52.93]Okay.
[236:01.21]I am so...
[236:03.73]God damn proud of you.
[236:06.35]Look what you've done.
[236:08.09]Look what you've been able to accomplish.
[236:12.18]Take a look outside.
[236:13.96]See that sun up there?
[236:16.02]It's shining down on you.
[236:18.26]Go for it.
[236:19.82]Do it.
[236:22.12]You know you can.
[236:26.28]Good luck.
[236:28.76]I almost just leaned in and went... That would have been really bad.
[236:34.21]There you go.
[236:34.67]There you go.
[236:37.63]Where's my money?
[236:38.19]Alright, Buffalant.
[236:41.13]That's a good Buffalant.
[236:46.51]It was a sarcastic voice.
[236:50.85]It wasn't?
[236:58.16]There's the request.
[236:59.14]Ooh, I've completed his page.
[237:01.56]What's that mean?
[237:11.46]3,500.
[237:11.52]It's new.
[237:14.96]Get it in there.
[237:17.08]Okay, there's the flying Dodrio.
[237:21.26]Dodrio is now complete.
[237:27.05]+2 JRM to the moon.
[237:38.24]Better photo.
[237:46.10]Nice work.
[237:50.25]Nice work.
[237:51.29]Why?
[237:51.87]What the fuck?
[237:52.63]Why is that one so much better?
[237:55.77]What?
[237:56.03]I guess he's powering up.
[238:03.06]Nice work.
[238:10.53]Mom said it's my turn on the Xbox.
[238:13.07]Go play it.
[238:13.95]It's in the other room.
[238:14.69]I'm on the Switch.
[238:17.81]Can you not differentiate the two consoles?
[238:20.26]I can't help you, little bro.
[238:26.52]This chat is omega fucked right now.
[238:47.90]Okay, now let me get my presents.
[238:56.45]Hey, little bro.
[239:03.97]Unmovement?
[239:04.51]That's a really bad picture.
[239:07.13]This is more apple than it is guy jumping.
[239:11.04]Ooh.
[239:15.94]Okay, this one.
[239:20.98]Awesome.
[239:24.52]You got a profile icon, Rita.
[239:26.08]Okay.
[239:30.20]Anymore?
[239:34.71]I gotta go back here, right?
[239:36.27]Okay.
[239:40.69]When... What's his name?
[239:43.43]Magnum?
[239:44.03]When Magnum gets to the spot, starts looking around restlessly.
[239:47.33]Okay.
[239:48.07]Okay.
[239:49.74]That tree.
[239:50.86]He's looking for a friend.
[239:51.76]This is cool.
[240:07.67]Magnum.
[240:09.22]Oh, I dropped my magnum condom for my monster dong.
[240:21.84]Where's the other way around?
[240:22.64]Oh, I dropped my monster condom for my magnum dong.
[240:28.90]It's that one.
[240:29.48]I did it the wrong way.
[240:30.20]Okay.
[240:39.11]I need to get this big dragon thing.
[240:46.03]I did it wrong?
[241:00.60]Oh, my God, it's an Eevee.
[241:02.77]Whoa.
[241:03.49]Oh.
[241:40.32]I can't believe I just got a picture of an Eevee.
[241:42.44]It's... It's... It's... Everyone's.
[241:48.16]Oh, my God.
[241:48.60]I can't believe I got a picture of Eevee.
[241:50.36]That's my... Everyone's.
[241:52.02]Favorite Pokémon.
[242:03.95]Okay.
[242:04.07]So, hold on.
[242:04.47]Now, when he gets to this tree, he's looking for a friend.
[242:16.14]Did I do anything else?
[242:23.88]Eevee is god tier.
[242:26.80]Always have an Eevee in your party.
[242:32.09]Eevee is... Eevee is air type, water type, ground type.
[242:39.53]And has two Earth attacks.
[242:52.30]Okay, so where's the friend?
[242:59.52]Here comes the friend.
[243:01.78]We're looking for the friend.
[243:03.10]Okay, where's the friend?
[243:14.18]See a friend?
[243:14.92]He's waiting for a friend.
[243:17.34]Right here.
[243:18.36]He's looking for a friend right here.
[243:19.94]In front of this tree.
[243:22.67]Behind you.
[243:28.26]No, no, no, no.
[243:30.12]They came from behind.
[243:32.54]Alright, let's go attack.
[243:37.71]Oh, there go all of my helicopters.
[243:39.77]They came from, they came from, they came, they came from, they came from behind.
[243:52.28]TV, I got it.
[243:52.80]They came from, they came from, from, behind, behind.
[243:58.92]They came from.
[244:03.94]Remember, you're high as fuck today.
[244:16.29]Go complain about it.
[244:17.45]Go complain about it then.
[244:19.75]Go complain about it.
[244:25.21]Sorry, I'm sorry.
[244:25.95]That was the mustache talking.
[244:28.53]The mustache is making me do that.
[244:35.13]Which one?
[244:35.53]This one?
[244:49.11]I don't know which one is the best one.
[244:50.26]Probably the jumping one.
[244:59.52]this one I can't replace that one that one's too good oh wait okay here we go oh perfect that one's better this one's good uh this one right here
[245:28.48]Why is your shot composition so shitty?
[245:30.10]I didn't know I was in film school.
[245:32.64]This is good EXP.
[245:34.30]It's 5400.
[245:34.64]Sustache.
[245:58.48]Funny, Jeremy used to be a wedding photographer.
[246:03.30]Um, I'm sorry.
[246:05.50]I think there's something a little different with holding a camera and filming people than holding two Joy-Con switch controllers that don't, you don't have any manual zoom, I don't have an ISO, I don't have an f-stop, and taking pictures of like cartoon animals that jump out behind trees and shit.
[246:28.64]This is a little different.
[246:29.94]I guarantee you, if you gave this game to Martin Scorsese, he would take like four of these shitty pictures and be like, what the fuck is this?
[246:38.38]What is this game?
[246:39.10]This is cute.
[246:40.46]I'm going to go out and make million dollar pictures.
[246:42.44]I'm going to enjoy it.
[246:46.25]You think he'd care?
[246:59.26]Somebody just said, just say it's too hard.
[247:02.08]It's too hard.
[247:06.26]I didn't get anything?
[247:10.62]What?
[247:10.96]How is that not the friend?
[247:11.94]I don't understand.
[247:26.76]Did I not get it?
[247:33.01]When Magnum gets to the spot, it starts looking around kind of restlessly.
[247:36.62]Do you think it's looking for one of its friends?
[247:39.70]Isn't Eevee just running around?
[247:56.06]Otto's wood toy.
[247:57.08]I know.
[247:58.42]Before I play Pac-Man, I'm going to get it.
[248:00.52]You'll see it.
[248:00.92]Don't worry.
[248:03.34]Good luck.
[248:14.47]Let's go.
[248:15.14]Okay.
[248:22.42]Now wait until he gets here.
[248:25.91]Does, um... Does the Play-Doh dinosaur like apples?
[248:36.23]No, not really.
[248:44.60]Let's fucking go.
[248:45.62]Viewers are going to drop if you switch to Pac-Man, remember that.
[248:49.98]Whatever.
[249:02.52]Look!
[249:02.86]Look!
[249:03.78]I got them!
[249:04.80]That's what he's looking for.
[249:05.56]Dude, I am getting way too excited over the back of a cereal box.
[249:19.30]You know what I mean?
[249:20.06]I'm getting way too excited about this.
[249:21.44]I turned 36 this year.
[249:28.23]He's looking.
[249:30.19]What's he looking for?
[249:37.40]All eyes on him.
[249:38.38]As long as you're having fun, it's alright.
[249:42.53]Yeah, I know.
[249:51.55]I was too excited.
[249:53.61]Okay, here we go.
[249:54.75]Where is this friend that's apparently over here?
[249:57.69]Is he going to get here?
[250:00.13]Is he going to look around?
[250:03.94]I don't see anybody.
[250:08.20]Is nobody here?
[250:08.90]Is nobody here?
[250:15.43]What?
[250:15.71]What's that?
[250:40.42]You missed it?
[250:41.14]It's this tree right here.
[250:42.39]It's this one.
[250:43.29]There's nothing here.
[250:43.87]How do I like my steak cooked?
[250:56.21]I like my steak cooked.
[250:57.53]However the chef wants to prepare it.
[251:01.63]Unless, of course, that's medium rare.
[251:04.82]I listen for it.
[251:06.20]I usually say, oh, well, however the chef likes it.
[251:08.26]And they go, oh, medium rare?
[251:09.32]And I go, no, no, thank you.
[251:10.66]Medium, please.
[251:11.24]Medium will.
[251:27.91]I'm going to tell you guys something.
[251:29.35]A lot of you don't want to hear this.
[251:32.99]Yeah, you guys, you know, talk like, okay, boomer, like you're a boomer, boomer shit.
[251:37.45]Caring about the, how cooked your steak is, is such a boomer thing to care about.
[251:49.05]That's a huge, that's a, that's a quite a boomer thing to care about.
[251:54.81]Whoa, why is this four?
[251:57.98]I'm gonna use this one.
[252:05.70]like that uh which one one or two one or two probably two like get caring that somebody likes their steak medium versus medium rare I could see like a big fat boomer guy at a grill scoffing at the fact that I said that
[252:29.27]hey uh how do you want your uh how do you want your burger uh medium please okay you young millennial alright medium medium well sure thing you want avocado on it too that's a boomer thing to care about that's cute I like that one
[253:00.68]The boomers were right.
[253:02.14]I have two of the same picture.
[253:14.31]Different versions of that emo.
[253:19.33]Am I going to have them all be this?
[253:25.13]Nice work.
[253:31.60]This one's better.
[253:32.30]There's more friends.
[253:46.12]You mean judging someone?
[253:47.42]No, judging somebody on their... How they eat their hamburger.
[253:52.25]On the temperature of the meat.
[254:05.99]And I don't want to get any food-borne illnesses.
[254:09.81]You know what happens if you don't cook fucking red meat all the way through?
[254:19.45]You like your bloody steak, you like your bloody hamburger with fucking red blood coming out of it?
[254:27.54]Be careful!
[254:39.02]You're a weakling.
[254:50.95]It's Maya Globlin, not blood.
[254:54.89]Okay, look, I can make up a Pokémon name for stuff too.
[255:09.42]mods please help grandpa's shouting at me again I have to get this one this is one of I have to get a new zone what's happening I need to get to level two okay I'll get to level two right here level two knight let's go caring about steak is Joe rogan
[255:48.33]I don't even know what you mean by that, but I don't know.
[255:50.13]Somehow I do.
[255:50.79]I don't know what that even means, but I kind of knew it.
[255:53.79]I know what it means.
[255:54.43]It's weird, right?
[255:55.99]I don't really even know what that means.
[255:57.13]Have you ever had elk meat?
[256:06.70]No, I have not.
[256:11.52]I've not had venison.
[256:13.51]I've not had elk.
[256:24.34]I don't want to take any pictures of the spider.
[256:27.16]What was that?
[256:27.68]Alright, get a bunch of good photos.
[256:31.58]I just need to level up.
[256:36.99]How do you want your Fortnite burger?
[257:09.31]Are you a juicy or dry kind of guy?
[257:12.69]Um, I'd say probably more we're in the juicy department.
[257:18.51]I don't like it wet, though, because then it ruins the bun.
[257:21.56]Everybody wants, like, a bloody hamburger.
[257:24.12]It ruins the bun.
[257:25.20]The bun gets seeped in with this pink liquid that turns it soppy and gross.
[257:50.44]I really mean this, and I might gross somebody out here, but whatever.
[257:54.69]I would prefer... If you were to... Let me just get a photo here.
[258:01.41]I would prefer it if you were to burn my hamburger.
[258:06.13]I mean, like, unrecognizable.
[258:09.75]It's like char.
[258:10.95]It's not even meat anymore.
[258:12.61]And eat a rare hamburger.
[258:14.83]I would rather you leave it on...
[258:18.02]To a point where like you could like we're talking about burn like light it on fire and let it sit there I'm talking about like the skin on the marshmallow when you let it just go in there and let this just sit in the campfire and That that's what I'm talking about.
[258:34.11]I'd rather eat that than a rare steak I have not taken any pictures of those who take photos.
[258:46.30]I
[258:53.97]Burger, yes.
[258:54.47]Steak, no.
[258:55.05]Nope, both.
[258:59.23]If you brought a rare steak to me, I don't care how nice of a restaurant it is.
[259:04.62]This could be like a $300 plate.
[259:08.16]Finest cut of meat.
[259:09.44]Rare.
[259:10.48]I would order something from the kids menu.
[259:14.44]I'd be like, can I just get like the fucking hot dog, the mac and cheese, and corn?
[259:19.10]I don't want that.
[259:21.66]I would not eat a rare steak.
[259:36.95]I just don't like it.
[259:41.96]I will eat sushi.
[259:43.96]Sometimes.
[259:45.22]On very rare occasions.
[259:50.08]But there's something about that raw red meat.
[259:54.89]I cannot do it.
[259:59.23]Unbased as fuck, my dude.
[260:00.99]Just for your information.
[260:02.09]Hahaha.
[260:10.71]Parasites are a myth.
[260:13.53]What?
[260:22.84]Would you ever go vegetarian?
[260:24.24]No.
[260:24.50]Like, I like the taste of chicken too much.
[260:36.02]I love a good steak and cheese sandwich.
[260:39.70]I could never give it up.
[260:41.34]Not in a hundred million years.
[260:42.54]I couldn't.
[260:43.10]I just couldn't do it.
[260:44.64]Now, they're getting close.
[260:48.04]They're getting close.
[260:49.29]Like, the Beyond Meat stuff, the Impossible Burger stuff, I think Beyond just tastes a little better.
[260:54.79]I think Beyond's a better product, if I have to be honest with you.
[261:00.35]They might get there soon.
[261:02.89]Like, I'm gonna give it probably like ten years.
[261:08.33]10 more years, I think they're going to get it.
[261:10.67]They'll figure out the chemical composition to make it so you're eating meat, but you're not even eating it.
[261:15.71]They'll get it.
[261:16.31]Maybe like 10, maybe 20.
[261:17.07]This one is probably the best.
[261:34.82]I'm just looking for experience.
[261:45.45]Now, I did not just say that I think that Beyond burgers are better than real meat.
[261:50.05]I didn't say that.
[261:50.69]I said they're getting close, and they might be there in 10 to 20 years, which they probably will be.
[262:01.93]Give me that experience.
[262:09.02]Did you say that Beyond was better than Impossible?
[262:15.42]Yes.
[262:24.89]And you know that I'm not making this up.
[262:27.43]You know that I'm telling you the truth.
[262:30.37]Because I lost a shitload of money buying puts on Beyond Meat like four and a half years ago when they went into like IPL.
[262:40.83]You know that I'm not bullshitting you here.
[262:47.55]We all know that story.
[262:49.02]I think it's a better product than Impossible.
[263:01.05]Buying puts OMEGALUL.
[263:02.21]This was like four years ago.
[263:04.09]This wasn't like last weekend.
[263:12.06]I just didn't think that Beyond Meat should have the valuation of like all the airlines and every car company in America.
[263:18.90]I'm sorry.
[263:19.46]It was crazy.
[263:20.60]It was insane.
[263:21.32]He shorted Beyond Meat.
[263:31.02]Yeah, I did.
[263:31.70]You know that.
[263:33.42]I've been very transparent about that.
[263:39.06]Back when it first came out, it went up to like almost $300 a share.
[263:43.56]And I was like, this is, what the hell is this?
[263:55.98]And I got burned real bad.
[263:57.78]And I, you know, when they say you may have learned your lesson.
[264:08.46]Remember, you're wasting our sub money.
[264:12.83]It was actually YouTube money.
[264:15.87]That was before I made anything on Twitch.
[264:19.49]That was back in like 2015, 2016.
[264:21.55]That wasn't Twitch money.
[264:22.53]That was YouTube money.
[264:23.41]That wasn't your... That wasn't with you guys.
[264:30.26]Come on.
[264:30.74]That was six years ago.
[264:39.55]Whatever it was, I don't know.
[264:56.44]It also was not very much.
[264:58.79]A lot of you guys are somehow assuming that I put, like, $500 million on, like, a short on Beyond Meat.
[265:08.96]No, that, I wasn't, it was not even, it was not, it was not very much money at all.
[265:22.85]How do you like your eggs?
[265:24.01]I like them over medium.
[265:26.38]Not over easy.
[265:27.20]They get all over the plate and it ruins everything else that's on the plate.
[265:30.38]If you have bacon, toast, hash browns, eggs, and they're over easy, it just gets everywhere.
[265:37.55]And then it gets all over your bacon, all over your toast, all over your potatoes.
[265:41.07]I want it to be separated.
[265:45.41]I like a jammy yolk.
[265:47.37]Doesn't get everywhere and it's good.
[265:49.75]It's absolutely false.
[265:50.51]No, it's not.
[265:51.69]Alright.
[265:52.25]Let me just beat this.
[265:58.84]Over medium.
[266:10.80]I want good pictures.
[266:19.52]You don't even eat.
[266:22.38]That's the whole point.
[266:23.34]Yeah, maybe for you, I like to have all my stuff separated.
[266:27.99]I will make one exception.
[266:29.47]What was that?
[266:31.77]Was that a spider?
[266:34.23]Ooh, that is a spider.
[266:39.20]The only exception I make is corned beef hash.
[266:46.56]So, if you have corned beef hash, and you drop an over easy egg on top of it, you let it sit on top and you break the yolk,
[266:56.25]It gets really kind of, you have to lay the egg right on top of the corned beef hash.
[267:01.19]That's the only exception where I'll have an over easy egg.
[267:04.57]And then it gets in there, but that's the point.
[267:07.47]That was done intentionally.
[267:08.98]It was done intentionally.
[267:12.22]Having just regular over easy eggs, unintentionally you get your shit everywhere.
[267:15.40]I don't like that.
[267:21.65]I need somebody to do something else.
[267:22.79]I need an animal to do something.
[267:24.67]These things are cute, I guess, but I need you to do something cool.
[267:40.46]Eat.
[267:41.37]Eat that.
[267:49.15]Good one.
[267:49.59]That's a good pick.
[267:53.13]What's your favorite rom-com?
[267:54.31]Is it You've Got Mail?
[268:12.42]Got it.
[268:12.66]You can do a little dance if you take pictures of me.
[268:19.65]Okay.
[268:27.21]I keep fucking missing those toucans.
[268:29.97]I know.
[268:30.69]I was waiting for it.
[268:31.63]Dude, I'm gonna restart.
[268:41.26]You like Among Us?
[268:42.32]No.
[268:44.24]No, I don't.
[268:52.33]You know why I don't like Among Us?
[268:54.55]Because I can't give you an opinion if I do or don't like it.
[268:58.25]I can't tell you because I've never played it.
[269:02.22]Wait for the jump.
[269:03.44]Got it.
[269:24.91]Next game, please.
[269:25.59]You've been playing the same level.
[269:27.31]Yeah, that's Pokémon Snap.
[269:28.51]I'm playing Pac-Man and, like, I don't know.
[269:41.94]I want to take a picture of the Wooper.
[269:48.15]Eat that, Wooper.
[269:48.77]Come on.
[269:50.91]Eat it.
[269:51.29]Please.
[269:51.69]No, he's going to be mad at me.
[270:03.97]Pokémon Snap in real life.
[270:05.27]I want to do a bird watching stream if that counts.
[270:17.00]That's a pretty cute photo.
[270:18.08]I'm like eating the apple.
[270:20.62]The apple's in his mouth.
[270:31.05]And I wanted to have binoculars that had cameras in them.
[270:33.93]So you could see what I see when I hold binoculars up.
[270:37.02]It's two cameras.
[270:49.38]Go to a petting zoo.
[271:09.99]You're sweet.
[271:10.63]Hope you have a good bird watching stream.
[271:12.25]Oh, thank you.
[271:14.37]That's really nice of you to say.
[271:15.93]Thank you.
[271:18.05]Alright, I got a three here.
[271:26.64]Which is the best one?
[271:27.90]Probably that one?
[271:28.52]No.
[271:28.74]I mean, this is a horrible picture, but it's definitely going to be this one.
[271:42.78]This is also a three.
[271:46.40]The one I took originally is so much better, but we'll do that one.
[271:50.03]I have a new blooper.
[271:54.95]I do, really.
[271:55.77]Hmm.
[272:00.59]Okay, that one's good.
[272:03.76]Alright, this should bring me to another level.
[272:14.40]Hire people to dress up in bird costumes and climb up the trees and act like they're real.
[272:21.72]I mean, that's really funny.
[272:31.55]But I would be putting somebody's life in danger by having them have to go up in a really tall, like 150 foot tall tree.
[272:41.43]The thought is funny, but I don't think anyone's gonna do that.
[272:45.45]Alright, did I finally level up?
[273:00.34]Finally.
[273:10.14]This is definitely a level up.
[273:11.00]It has to be.
[273:19.70]That's a new one.
[273:22.14]This is worse than Pokémon Go?
[273:28.10]Well, I mean, the whole point of... You don't battle... Oh, I love snackies.
[273:42.35]Level 2.
[273:42.93]Come on.
[273:43.31]There we go.
[273:46.59]Alright.
[273:47.05]Level 2.
[273:47.29]Let's open up a new zone.
[273:54.32]By the way, thanks to the progress you made, I've got something to report.
[273:57.49]There we are.
[274:10.56]This game is good, if not greater than Pokémon Go.
[274:12.54]People have been waiting.
[274:13.26]Hold on.
[274:13.54]I can do it too.
[274:20.30]Yeah, we got new islands.
[274:43.23]One on this long, narrow island and another offshore in the middle of the water.
[274:47.17]Captain.
[274:50.80]Captain.
[274:52.32]Never got to that spot offshore, did he?
[274:54.64]This is going to be amazing.
[274:56.00]I'll let you decide what order you want to visit them in.
[274:58.64]Keep up the good work.
[275:03.70]Why are you such a food snob, but you drink Huel, OMEGALUL?
[275:08.21]I'm not ordering Huel at a restaurant.
[275:12.13]It would be very bizarre.
[275:13.31]Now, wouldn't it?
[275:18.23]Tree-dwelling Pokémon.
[275:21.47]When that huge tree lit up, I saw a bunch of Pokémon fly out of it, but I couldn't tell what kind of Pokémon they were.
[275:31.92]I took that one, too.
[275:32.52]Did I take this one?
[275:36.80]No, that's not even mine.
[275:39.46]Alright, new zone.
[275:44.62]How's it going?
[275:45.04]Enjoying your research jaunts?
[275:47.34]Listen, I've got to tell you something.
[275:48.49]There's a feature I originally forgot to suggest to the professor.
[275:51.85]But I got him to add it to your research camera.
[275:56.49]It's a melody player.
[275:58.21]It lets your camera play a little tune.
[276:03.02]A little magical tune can prompt Pokémon to show you whole new sides of themselves.
[276:10.02]That's awesome.
[276:11.42]Could you fill in the details?
[276:14.35]sure thing if you press r a melody will play medium well heal that's just I left it in the sun for an hour while it's playing you can press r again to make it stop little music could wake up sleeping Pokémon oh the Peter Griffin character I want to go use it on or make some Pokémon get up and dance I haven't had a chance to try it though so I'm no expert yet next let's give it a whirl
[276:43.67]The game just opened wide up.
[276:50.97]First, let me go use this on Peter Griffin.
[276:52.38]Where was he?
[276:54.06]Where was Peter Griffin?
[276:55.12]Jungle?
[276:58.58]Where was Peter Griffin?
[276:59.42]Here?
[276:59.58]Or was it the jungle during the day?
[277:17.53]Let's see if we can get him to dance.
[277:28.00]Alright.
[277:33.25]Play the tune.
[277:38.83]Dance!
[277:39.19]I wanna dance.
[277:49.82]This better work on Peter Griffin.
[277:57.31]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[278:03.87]He hates it.
[278:07.40]Okay... Alright, Peter!
[278:11.88]Get up!
[278:16.08]Really?
[278:20.14]What?
[278:20.40]That's stupid.
[278:23.66]Why does he not get up?
[278:30.35]I hear Bugleberry.
[278:31.27]He's scared of the snake.
[278:52.75]Ooh.
[279:00.98]You gonna dance?
[279:04.10]I... I think this is a prank.
[279:11.76]He's dancing?
[279:23.51]He just looked like Stuart Griffin.
[279:25.49]He just did.
[279:26.49]It looks like he's Stuart Griffin in a costume.
[279:33.56]It sounds like an ice cream truck.
[279:34.60]It kind of does.
[279:38.28]Wooden dog toy now.
[279:39.78]Just wait until I go to Pac-Man.
[279:41.50]Did I get it?
[279:47.42]That was cool.
[279:54.95]Oh, hold on.
[279:56.15]I need to do this.
[279:56.71]Come on, I have to get it.
[280:07.32]Did I get him?
[280:11.48]I got it!
[280:15.40]Hold on, does he come back?
[280:16.26]Did I get it?
[280:27.88]Whoa, what's he got?
[280:28.40]He's got something.
[280:29.80]That little guy had something.
[280:30.74]What was that?
[280:34.90]He had like a little sack.
[280:54.69]I don't think this does anything.
[281:04.77]Brother this guy stinks Wait look at they're walking together They get him jumping that was cool, okay, he's gonna do his jump now Oh
[281:49.93]Okay, I think I got it.
[281:58.99]I'm gonna go to the new area.
[282:00.31]And then I'll play Pac-Man, I promise.
[282:03.13]I want to see the two new areas, and then I'm going to play, get a few photos of each area.
[282:09.80]Then I'm going to go get the wooden toy to smell it in front of you.
[282:15.56]Then I'm going to play Pac-Man 99.
[282:16.76]This is awful.
[282:27.91]I hated every second of it.
[282:33.29]Oh, that's new.
[282:34.01]When he's rolling around, okay.
[282:35.69]What's the best one?
[282:36.29]Probably gonna have to be this one.
[282:38.35]It's the only one you can see.
[282:39.17]I like the angry one.
[282:46.28]Goddammit, I want Peter Griffin to turn around so bad.
[283:00.04]This one's cute.
[283:02.78]Yeah, look at that.
[283:03.62]That's so cute.
[283:04.92]I like that one.
[283:07.88]I like that one.
[283:18.55]I like... I like this one over here.
[283:40.95]This one.
[283:45.31]And that one.
[283:49.41]And that one.
[283:50.07]Alright.
[283:53.23]Analyze it, please.
[283:56.69]I'm going to do a three-hour BRB.
[283:58.39]Why would I go BRB for three hours?
[284:01.65]What are you talking about?
[284:14.28]Fill it up.
[284:16.46]I'm sorry, I didn't mean when I said you stink.
[284:18.32]Gold?
[284:25.26]Diamond.
[284:29.26]Do a coloring stream?
[284:34.35]Like a coloring book.
[284:35.29]I already did that.
[284:37.17]Didn't everybody hate that?
[284:38.21]I did like a coloring book stream and everybody hated it.
[284:40.18]Did I?
[284:41.44]No, that was... No, no, no, no, I didn't.
[284:43.06]I did like the... No, everybody loved the highlights stream.
[284:49.61]I didn't do a coloring book.
[284:50.53]I did like an activity book.
[284:52.33]Everybody loved that stream.
[284:53.27]That was a lot of fun.
[285:02.52]Now that was the card game stream.
[285:04.44]That's the worst stream I've ever done.
[285:07.42]The unlocked stream is the worst stream I've ever done.
[285:11.08]I would argue that you could not convince me otherwise.
[285:18.76]You couldn't even read the text.
[285:20.62]My webcam is so bad.
[285:21.58]And it was just not even interesting at all.
[285:25.11]It was very painfully uninteresting.
[285:28.94]Karazhan stream.
[285:29.72]At least the Karazhan stream was funny because I was getting shit on for like 12 hours.
[285:36.10]The unlock card stream was not funny.
[285:41.71]It was awful.
[285:43.85]No, the WoW stream was not worse than the unlock card game stream.
[285:50.61]No, it was not.
[285:51.30]I had a lot of fun on that stream.
[285:52.42]I love that game.
[285:53.90]I disagree.
[285:54.26]Okay.
[286:00.62]Alright, new zone.
[286:11.53]I get to level 3?
[286:13.79]Almost.
[286:14.05]Alright, I want to see the new zone.
[286:16.89]The one with the rocks was weird.
[286:29.25]It was, wasn't it?
[286:32.88]We're streaming yet.
[286:34.44]Ooh, this is in the desert.
[286:36.98]Check this place out.
[286:38.76]I just want to check out the two new zones, and then I'm going to go take a break, go get the wood, and then we'll play Pac-Man 99 for a while.
[286:54.85]We got new shit.
[286:56.09]Do you not like that?
[287:02.91]There's just new stuff everywhere.
[287:08.21]This is awesome.
[287:17.41]Some tracks left by a small Pokémon.
[287:22.35]What is that?
[287:25.05]You eat?
[287:29.58]Whoa, what are you doing dude?
[287:37.56]Come here you dance That's a good picture.
[287:46.24]Oh shit.
[287:47.14]How did I why would I take the camera away?
[287:48.70]What am I stupid?
[287:49.40]That was cool
[288:02.54]Okay, I'll be honest.
[288:03.46]I feel like I'm playing Five Nights at Freddy's.
[288:07.58]I feel like I'm just changing and I have to do this.
[288:09.16]I have to wind up the toy.
[288:10.46]I have to go over here, take a photo, go to this one.
[288:25.95]That was cool.
[288:26.73]That was a good one.
[288:27.27]I don't know.
[288:31.74]I can't.
[288:34.64]Remember, you need to reload the gun.
[288:40.72]This place is really open.
[288:42.00]There's not a lot of places to hide.
[288:43.08]Am I going up in a tornado?
[288:45.38]Oh, no, no, no.
[288:47.56]Okay.
[288:48.22]I thought I was getting sucked up.
[288:54.08]So cute.
[288:55.84]So cute.
[288:56.50]Okay.
[289:09.30]Got it.
[289:09.54]Did I get it?
[289:09.94]I think so.
[289:18.48]You want to eat that?
[289:24.40]Whoa, he burns it.
[289:35.19]Ice cream truck.
[289:37.88]You know, I watched a video not that long ago of an ice cream truck dog compilation where dogs just get in line and eat ice cream with the ice cream truck.
[289:52.73]It was really cute.
[290:01.69]Link it.
[290:02.11]I can't link it.
[290:03.35]I don't know where it even is.
[290:10.19]How sad is your life that you'll watch that?
[290:13.07]What?
[290:14.39]It's just a cute video.
[290:16.01]What the fuck?
[290:18.19]What are you talking about?
[290:19.43]If I'm in a doctor's office waiting room or something, I go, stay away from those dog ice cream videos.
[290:33.31]He's pissed.
[290:38.55]Oh, he's gonna eat.
[290:39.71]You're not too mad to, like, not eat.
[290:52.84]You can turn quickly with the D-pad.
[290:55.59]Oh, well, that's about five hours worth of gameplay that I did not play correctly.
[291:21.05]That was cool.
[291:21.89]I like that area.
[291:26.79]This is probably the best one.
[291:36.16]Tasting the apple.
[291:37.58]Eating the apple.
[291:40.76]No, definitely the happy one.
[291:42.08]I like that one.
[291:42.54]It's the one where he's right in the camera.
[291:49.59]That one.
[291:56.36]Hmm.
[291:58.78]That one.
[292:03.18]Oh, this is a Vivillon.
[292:05.14]Just a different version.
[292:05.88]I didn't get a picture of it.
[292:13.27]Ooh.
[292:17.41]Ooh.
[292:19.47]That one.
[292:24.29]And the one when he's opening the mouth.
[292:29.37]That one's good too, though.
[292:30.49]I don't know.
[292:34.29]That one looks like Bowser.
[292:40.23]I'm going to say this one.
[292:42.63]No, this one.
[292:43.69]Alright, go.
[292:57.13]I wish I could see high-resolution versions of them before I pick them.
[293:00.87]You pick kind of like a shitty version before you get to see what it actually looks like.
[293:03.34]I like that one.
[293:16.72]What's a perfect score?
[293:17.56]Let me know.
[293:21.38]Nice work.
[293:28.36]6,000?
[293:28.40]7,000?
[293:28.42]Like 1,000.
[293:28.60]Toilet.
[293:28.94]Thank you.
[293:29.34]No, it's not.
[293:34.44]That was wrong.
[293:35.06]It's like 6,000.
[293:35.36]6K is perfect.
[293:36.60]I hate the original.
[293:37.44]Okay.
[294:02.06]This is a boring baby game.
[294:03.16]Please play Escape from Tarkov.
[294:07.16]I would rather eat a rare steak than play Escape from Tarkov.
[294:16.38]You guys, who were the naysayers that said this was not a good photo?
[294:30.54]I got diamonds.
[294:44.71]What's wrong with Escape from Tarkov?
[294:46.95]Nothing.
[294:47.23]I just don't want to play it.
[294:50.51]If you presented me with two options, you have to either play Tarkov for an hour or eat a rare steak.
[294:55.27]I would eat the steak on camera right now.
[294:57.91]I have nothing against Tarkov.
[294:58.95]I just do not want to play that.
[295:01.23]I don't want to play that right now.
[295:08.44]Alright, what's the other place?
[295:14.01]Hold on, I want to read this.
[295:28.51]I think you're a really bad streamer.
[295:29.84]You're terrible.
[295:30.42]I hate you.
[295:31.32]You're boring and lame and dumb and bad.
[295:33.02]Not funny.
[295:33.44]I went to middle school with you.
[295:34.74]You were cool then, but not now.
[295:36.72]I peaked at middle school.
[295:44.59]How do you peak in middle school?
[295:46.07]I don't understand that.
[296:01.44]This is the beach.
[296:02.10]Ooh, I like this place.
[296:07.18]Ooh, I really like this place.
[296:13.29]Like apples?
[296:15.79]He's got boxing gloves.
[296:23.26]Do something weird.
[296:35.42]I don't know why that... God, this looks like... Like Patrick on drugs?
[296:45.59]This is like crack Patrick.
[296:47.79]I don't know why I think that.
[296:48.78]I don't know why I'm seeing that.
[296:50.36]What is that?
[296:53.52]What the hell is that thing?
[297:00.95]Whoa.
[297:06.75]Oh my god!
[297:09.61]Sounds like you're the one that's on crack.
[297:38.65]I can do it if I try hard enough.
[297:41.03]It's kind of moving.
[298:03.14]You don't have that much depth.
[298:06.21]What are you talking about?
[298:06.83]I'll never do that again.
[298:17.90]I'm going to at least 100 more times before my career ends.
[298:25.10]Hey, if my career ends tomorrow, if my career ended tomorrow, I would upload a Twitter video of me doing that 100 times.
[298:36.02]He's holding up middle fingers.
[298:44.46]These things are cute.
[298:45.04]How do you say this?
[298:49.24]Pyuku... Pyukumuku.
[298:52.42]Pyukumuku?
[298:53.00]Are they going to fight over the... What the hell?
[299:01.47]That was weird.
[299:16.78]That wasn't bad.
[299:23.41]Or solo?
[299:26.99]You like apples.
[299:32.52]Alright.
[299:33.06]Now you're going to do a funny little dance.
[299:34.44]I don't know why I feel like it's going to take off.
[299:55.25]What the?
[299:55.95]What is that thing?
[299:57.11]That's a Pokémon?
[299:57.93]I thought that was an NPC.
[300:11.52]I want to eat that apple.
[300:17.60]No.
[300:19.58]He's gone.
[300:24.23]You can just turn around here.
[300:27.49]Pikachu.
[300:27.87]Pikachu, look over here.
[300:30.45]Look.
[300:33.33]Pikachu, look.
[300:42.20]Okay.
[300:46.94]Dance.
[300:48.76]You like to dance?
[300:54.81]That was a Chad Ross Steak Eater.
[301:00.45]Chad, real diarrhea haver.
[301:11.39]These guys eat apples or anything?
[301:17.36]That's cool.
[301:17.94]I only have seven photos left.
[301:26.20]Oh, well, I'm done anyways.
[301:27.52]Okay.
[301:36.92]At somebody.
[301:37.70]You told me this guy was funny.
[301:40.62]Oh, no.
[301:43.68]Oh, no.
[301:48.62]Did I just ruin a friend circle?
[301:53.11]Used to be.
[301:53.93]Get out of here.
[301:54.91]I'm still funny.
[301:55.49]I still got it.
[301:56.01]Hey, dude, you told me this guy was funny.
[302:01.17]What the fuck, dude?
[302:06.12]Cartoon steam just came out of that guy's fucking neck.
[302:10.26]Underneath his shirt.
[302:11.30]I like that one.
[302:16.84]There's a better one, though.
[302:18.13]How is it?
[302:18.81]I guess I'll take it.
[302:19.33]That one.
[302:27.01]I guess I got a picture of that.
[302:35.25]Definitely the one with the hand.
[302:36.13]Definitely the one with the big flop.
[302:44.18]Probably this one.
[302:49.06]I got him from far away.
[302:49.98]That one.
[303:10.49]That's a good one.
[303:10.97]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[303:18.01]I'm going to go get the wood.
[303:18.83]I'm going to come back.
[303:21.21]I'm going to play Pac-Man 99 for a little while.
[303:26.88]And then I will say goodbye.
[303:28.80]I will say farewell.
[303:34.88]I will play a lot of Pac-Man 99.
[303:36.65]I'll try to get at least in the top 10.
[303:40.70]And we'll look at the wood.
[303:44.04]Okay, you want my review of Pokémon Snap?
[303:47.52]That was cute.
[303:50.39]That was a cute game.
[303:57.15]Looks like there's a lot to do.
[304:00.31]Looks like there's a lot of things to see.
[304:01.89]A lot of completionists will love it if they like Pokémon.
[304:12.01]I enjoyed it.
[304:13.12]I thought it was very fun.
[304:14.06]Although I don't know who any of these people are.
[304:18.38]I'm your friend that came over in the middle of the season that has not seen the show, but just said, I don't care.
[304:24.18]And you're like, um, okay, this is like episode 8 of like middle of the season, like the only 12 episodes.
[304:31.58]Like, I don't care.
[304:32.16]So, for that being that person, I thought it was pretty good.
[304:36.92]Nice work.
[304:45.71]Let's play Pac-Man.
[304:48.92]I will return in about two minutes.
[304:50.28]And we'll play Pac-Man 99.
[304:57.58]What did I get for a present?
[304:58.28]Hold on.
[304:59.56]Oh, no.
[304:59.98]Never mind.
[305:02.55]Hey, look at that.
[305:03.11]50 Pokémon species.
[305:10.49]Fighting type.
[305:11.69]Oh, that's cool.
[305:12.07]Alright.
[305:14.53]Let me make sure this saves in case I want to play it again.
[305:19.60]Five hours, 50 Pokémon.
[305:21.00]That's true.
[305:22.62]I'll be right back.
[305:23.08]See you guys in a minute.
