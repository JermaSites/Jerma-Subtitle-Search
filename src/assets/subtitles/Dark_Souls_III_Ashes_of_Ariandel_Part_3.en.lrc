[00:30.80]That is a game on Steam where you walk in and they give you 20,000 chips.
[00:34.68]It's not a real money casino.
[00:38.47]In fact, I don't even think you're allowed to do real money casinos on Twitch anymore, are you?
[00:43.39]Or there's a lot of strict rules.
[00:48.61]Hey, guess what, guys?
[00:50.05]You know why I did that?
[00:51.41]As early as I did?
[00:53.28]It's 7 o'clock right now.
[00:55.78]It's time to start the stream.
[01:01.95]Yeah, we are going to do sorcery.
[01:03.21]We're going to do Dark Souls 3 sorcery.
[01:05.05]We're going to end sorcery tomorrow night.
[01:06.97]Friday night.
[01:07.45]I feel like that's the best time to do it.
[01:09.48]Best time to do it.
[01:11.72]Alright, let me get Dark Souls 3 open.
[01:14.16]They give you 20k.
[01:17.92]Second account.
[01:18.90]No, I'm not playing that fucking game again.
[01:26.62]I want to do co-op.
[01:27.88]I had a lot of fun last night running around co-op.
[01:31.79]Yeah, it's 13 minutes late.
[01:35.85]Late, late, late, late.
[01:38.93]Sorcery's tomorrow night.
[01:42.34]How late is Sorcery tomorrow?
[01:43.32]It's going to be 7 o'clock.
[01:45.60]Right now, we're starting the stream.
[01:47.16]We're starting now.
[01:53.49]I was under the impression that that was not going to last very long.
[01:56.69]I just thought it would be fun.
[01:59.65]It was fun to lose all my chips in like less than 20 minutes.
[02:02.19]That was fun.
[02:02.57]I have to change the stream title.
[02:04.93]Hold on.
[02:10.84]Co-op with the sorcerer.
[02:22.19]Co-op with me.
[02:23.13]No, I don't know.
[02:23.65]What the hell am I going to name this?
[02:24.57]Just...
[02:32.01]Sorcerer.
[02:32.63]Dark Souls 3.
[02:43.35]That should update.
[02:45.33]If it doesn't update, I'm sorry, but it should.
[02:51.52]Where's my controller?
[02:55.26]Sorcerer.
[02:56.82]I'm not changing it from Sorcerer.
[03:03.18]Alright, here we go.

[04:04.06]Alright.
[04:04.86]Let's get some people in here.
[04:06.02]I had fun when I played with like three people last night.
[04:08.26]It was fun.
[04:13.56]Don't gamble your souls away.
[04:15.10]If there was, I wish there was like a little gamble thing you could do.
[04:20.54]But yeah.
[04:21.50]Welcome to the stream, guys.
[04:23.82]Just like getting started here.
[04:27.27]No big deal.
[04:28.53]Don't worry.
[04:30.59]Nothing happened.
[04:33.74]Alright, important.
[04:34.82]Very important.
[04:35.46]We need to know if... Is the audio lagging?
[04:40.80]When I hit things.
[04:43.24]Is there any delay?
[04:44.66]I hope not.
[04:45.04]Because I can't really change it at this point.
[04:51.14]Well, let me eat an ember.
[04:52.54]Password is slurp.
[04:54.20]Slurp.
[04:56.67]Password is Slurp, if you'd like to play.
[04:59.65]I have to fight... I think I'm at the Lothric Prince, I think.
[05:05.72]No.
[05:06.04]Good?
[05:06.38]Alright, good.
[05:07.96]Hell yeah.
[05:10.56]If you would like to play, like I said, come over to... This is the... What bonfire is this?
[05:16.35]Dragon's Lair armor.
[05:17.41]I'm going to go backwards.
[05:18.65]I'm going to go kill the prince.
[05:22.04]Off stream, I fully upgraded my Moonlit Greatsword to plus 5.
[05:31.71]Because it was like plus 3 last night, or plus 2, and I really wanted to get it to a position where it was usable.
[05:41.88]I can't believe I missed that.
[05:45.16]It is Slurp, right?
[05:47.64]Am I crazy?
[05:48.44]No, it has to.
[05:49.04]It's Slurp.
[05:49.48]It definitely is.
[05:52.29]Slurpia.
[05:53.21]S-L-U-R-P.
[05:56.39]Will you ever hit the casino again?
[05:58.66]Probably not.
[06:00.04]That was a one-time deal.
[06:01.82]I made my free account.
[06:03.66]And blew all my chips for fun.
[06:05.42]Alright, I'm gonna give the prince one go here.
[06:15.40]I got some crystal soul spears.
[06:16.72]These things are pretty deadly.
[06:23.02]Slurp.
[06:24.58]Thank you, Core Monster.
[06:26.20]Oh, shit.
[06:26.58]This is not in the right position.
[06:31.40]This thing is a little messed up.
[06:32.80]There it goes.
[06:34.82]Should be better now.
[06:37.70]Should be the key word there.
[06:42.55]Thank you, Phantom Trout and Core Monster.
[06:44.25]Both for resubs.
[06:47.27]Anybody here yet?
[06:47.91]Here's something I find interesting.
[06:52.30]It took less time for people to make an account in the casino game than for people to get into Dark Souls and come to this bonfire.
[07:01.33]Yeah, the moonlit greatsword.
[07:09.40]You can't put a summon sign there?
[07:10.98]Why not?
[07:12.76]That's dumb.
[07:17.34]Holy shit, what is that, like, huge Jupiter face thing?
[07:21.39]Somebody got a full face.
[07:24.79]Are you serious?
[07:25.49]That was the wrong door, I think.
[07:28.63]Yeah, it is.
[07:36.69]I got this.
[07:37.45]Skip.
[07:39.25]All these people are waiting for the casino.
[07:46.51]Fucking casino, man.
[07:47.68]What the hell was I thinking?
[07:50.13]It'll be fun.
[07:50.93]It'll be funny.
[07:54.27]Everyone just watched me throw fake money in the trash.
[07:57.73]I was just fucking stupid.
[08:02.88]Let's see if I can kill this guy in like two hits.
[08:11.26]Two.
[08:11.64]Hooray.
[08:14.15]This thing is crazy, but it tastes too much mana.
[08:16.83]It tastes like mana.
[08:25.76]And now I'm up here.
[08:33.42]I'll try it just 1v1.
[08:35.24]Me versus Prince.
[08:39.51]And we'll see if I can try it, like, beat it.
[08:42.29]I'm sure I can.
[08:43.19]I've already tried it once.
[08:44.69]Oh, my God.
[08:45.27]No, that was an instant teleport.
[08:47.45]How many souls are these, even?
[08:49.45]Not very much.
[08:50.43]Yeah, I'm just getting killed here.
[08:52.01]I also need another Estus Shard.
[09:05.52]Where'd you go?
[09:06.10]Whoo!
[09:09.64]Oh, what a great start.
[09:14.20]I haven't even warmed up yet.
[09:15.34]No, I got greedy.
[09:26.53]You know, I could just do this.
[09:27.57]I don't even see him.
[09:46.95]Don't do it, please!
[09:47.87]I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[10:02.47]I don't know.
[10:05.98]Maybe.
[10:11.84]Get behind him.
[10:21.87]Kill the little one!
[10:33.19]No!
[10:34.39]Oh, what?
[10:35.67]Bullshit.
[10:45.18]Cut off his fucking head!
[10:55.76]Die!
[10:57.94]Oh fuck, I forgot he does that move.
[11:00.52]I forgot he has that move.
[11:06.97]Shit.
[11:07.21]I'm not getting around him quick enough.
[11:19.22]Mistake.
[11:19.62]No!
[11:24.34]It's over.
[11:30.04]I could get him this time.
[11:33.04]I just gotta not waste any Estuses in the very beginning.
[11:39.52]Fuck!
[11:40.48]Fuck!
[11:42.50]Fuck!
[11:44.03]Fuck!
[11:52.49]Who's unsubscribed for four months and says, you suck?
[11:56.71]Hey!
[11:57.19]That's not very nice.
[12:03.09]That was close.
[12:03.85]I just had to knock him off one more time.
[12:13.32]No, streamer sucks?
[12:14.08]Did somebody just say that I suck?
[12:17.84]That person... I'm gonna fucking scream in their face.
[12:23.03]I know, I need the Estus upgrade so bad.
[12:25.55]You know what?
[12:25.83]I think I skipped a lot of them in the very beginning of the game.
[12:31.03]For some reason.
[12:31.59]I'm not sure why.
[12:33.21]Alright, I'm going for a real attempt this time.
[12:37.15]Give me a... I'm gonna take an Ember.
[12:38.89]I'm going for it.
[12:39.49]No fucking around this time.
[12:42.09]He's going down.
[12:44.53]Well, Krumalin, thanks for the sub.
[12:45.77]Welcome, dude.
[12:48.13]We're not gonna fuck around.
[12:49.17]I'm gonna just beat the absolute shit out of him.
[12:51.79]If I don't beat him this time, then we're gonna just Mario and Luigi this dude.
[12:54.83]I don't know how many summoning signs are here.
[12:59.90]Holy shit.
[13:01.76]Alright, brother.
[13:04.72]Let's go.
[13:10.58]Shit.
[13:10.68]I don't know what the hell I was thinking there.
[13:20.55]Fuck, I fucked it up.
[13:21.93]I already blew it.
[13:24.91]Where is he?
[13:25.21]I couldn't even see him and somehow I dodged it.
[13:31.89]Nah, this is a wash.
[13:33.39]I fucked it up.
[13:34.56]For some reason I thought I had great solar on.
[13:36.84]Not the big ice lance move.
[13:39.10]I fucked it up.
[13:41.14]Just kill me.
[13:42.82]Nah, just kill me.
[13:46.88]I was on Crystal Soul Spirit.
[13:48.36]I wanted to be on Great Soul Arrow.
[13:51.54]I fucked it up.
[13:55.82]Fucking uninstalling this game!
[14:06.01]Wrong way again.
[14:21.83]When you sub, but no thank you.
[14:23.05]What?
[14:23.57]Did I miss somebody?
[14:25.03]Oh, I missed weird bananas, didn't I?
[14:26.79]Well, thank you, weird bananas.
[14:38.64]I fucked that up.
[14:41.91]Oh, wow, this guy's fucked.
[14:42.85]I know, he really is.
[14:47.48]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:48.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:49.98]This is not correct.
[14:50.76]I was just... Fuck.
[14:53.28]I can't play Dark Souls and stream.
[14:56.97]Because I go in the fucking opposite direction.
[15:13.29]Oh.
[15:13.45]Okay.
[15:14.31]Can I... Okay, I'll take it.
[15:16.39]I can't, like, pull this?
[15:26.21]What I meant to say was I was supposed to go down there and get it.
[15:30.71]I wanted to go get that.
[15:31.47]I got it.
[15:33.63]Told you I was gonna get it.
[15:39.77]Told you I was gonna go get that.
[15:40.77]Alright, now I'm all ass backwards.
[15:46.60]Wait, that is where I needed to go.
[15:48.86]Right?
[15:49.10]What the fuck?
[15:51.86]I'm so confused right now.
[15:52.78]Doesn't this go up?
[15:57.39]My brain is fucking in a hundred directions right now.
[16:01.43]What is going on here?
[16:05.17]Why did that go down?
[16:07.53]Doesn't that... Doesn't that... That's the one that goes up.
[16:10.21]No, it's... There's too many elevators over here.
[16:15.07]No, that is the right one.
[16:24.65]This is the right elevator.
[16:29.47]No, it isn't!
[16:30.07]No, it isn't!
[16:30.61]What is happening?
[16:34.69]What is going on with my fi- I- I- I- wha- eh?
[16:43.83]Just go up!
[16:44.63]Go the fuck up!
[16:46.71]I want it to go up!
[17:01.00]Like, I couldn't pull that lever last time.
[17:16.05]I've never had this happen before.
[17:17.35]I've never done that.
[17:18.91]Okay.
[17:22.35]What the fuck?
[17:24.83]Okay.
[17:26.45]Sure thing.
[17:28.03]Didn't even know that existed.
[17:37.54]Fucking return in this game.
[17:41.14]Yeah, it's just like the same thing from the onion guy.
[17:42.72]I just fucking... Honest to God, dude.
[17:45.52]I've been on this elevator probably like fucking 30 times and I've never done that.
[17:50.03]I always am too.
[17:50.85]I always go... Why was it like that before?
[17:54.69]I can't even give you any reasons why it was down all the way in the bottom to begin with.
[18:00.42]You can't pull the lever.
[18:01.18]What does the lever... Yeah, what does the fucking lever even do?
[18:06.54]Quick, what's the password?
[18:07.52]Alright, let's go.
[18:10.40]No bullshit.
[18:11.46]I want a Soul Spear.
[18:13.62]What the fuck was that?
[18:15.58]What the f- Alright, no more fucking around.
[18:41.27]And drink.
[18:43.05]Really?
[19:09.15]That was lucky.
[19:23.18]I want to get behind you.
[19:34.27]Where is it?
[19:42.38]Shit!
[19:43.26]He's from two different directions!
[20:01.31]Fuck.
[20:08.16]What?! !
[20:10.88]What?!
[20:11.18]I was not even there.
[20:15.00]Alright, we'll just fucking co-op with him.
[20:17.79]We'll just co-op with this guy.
[20:18.73]I don't even care.
[20:23.67]I'm fucking done.
[20:24.85]I've done this like three times already.
[20:27.67]Take an Estus.
[20:28.33]We'll fucking bring in the whole Mario Party.
[20:30.60]I don't even care.
[20:34.20]This is my second playthrough on like a shit character.
[20:37.66]Bring in every single person.
[20:41.68]This guy sucks.
[20:50.30]You didn't kill him in one hit?
[21:01.71]Fucking sorcery sucks.
[21:03.25]Intellect characters suck.
[21:05.67]The game sucks.
[21:19.78]Gamer license revoked.
[21:31.61]Sorcery sucks, but that sword is really good.
[21:33.95]I know.
[21:35.71]No, don't fucking drive angry.
[21:37.97]That's important.
[21:45.43]Who is this?
[21:45.75]A guy with a giant wheel?
[21:47.59]Are you kidding me?
[21:48.15]Definitely.
[21:48.82]No, I can't summon him.
[21:52.98]So... This guy's name is Snattacat?
[21:57.38]How did he make a ca- This guy made a character within the last, like, three days and got him to, like, level 80.
[22:02.34]I already beat this guy on stream in the first playthrough.
[22:10.14]I don't need to do this shit again.
[22:11.30]I just want to bring the pumpkin head wheel guy in.
[22:13.76]Bring in the Snattacat.
[22:17.62]And bring in... Who is it?
[22:20.04]Why'd you leave?
[22:22.12]Why did that guy leave?
[22:29.80]What is this guy?
[22:30.33]This guy got like a bunch of swears in his name.
[22:32.05]No, I remember.
[22:32.41]This guy's name is Dicky.
[22:33.25]Why did that guy just leave?
[22:34.51]Is this person like even worth bringing in?
[22:45.99]It's because he's a Snattercat.
[22:57.75]How many people can I bring in?
[23:03.86]Oh.
[23:04.68]I guess some guy just got booted.
[23:05.66]I don't know.
[23:05.98]Oh, I didn't use the finger.
[23:06.84]Whatever.
[23:07.82]Sorry, guy that just got booted.
[23:10.04]Let's fucking kill this son of a bitch.
[23:20.46]I hate this character.
[23:21.78]I don't even like this game.
[23:22.84]I don't even like this game.
[23:25.52]Shut up.
[23:27.48]Sorcery is stupid.
[23:28.52]Intellect characters suck.
[23:34.73]Fucking game just cracked.
[23:35.57]Game just lagged.
[23:36.83]That's why I suck.
[23:48.72]Alright, I'm just getting like soup.
[23:50.18]Why did I not change flasks?
[23:54.21]Where did he go?
[23:57.29]I could have easily changed flasks.
[24:05.12]Oh, there goes a guy.
[24:16.45]This is not even, like, the actual boss.
[24:18.03]I'm doing, like, worse at this than I am when I fight him by my fucking self.
[24:27.89]Hyah!
[24:31.65]Oh boy, here we go.
[24:33.67]Alright, let's make it happen.
[24:43.19]Go!
[24:45.89]Come on!
[24:46.73]Kill!
[24:52.69]Oh boy, he got hit.
[24:57.73]Not cool.
[24:59.61]Free hits.
[25:02.27]None of these are hitting the little guy on the back.
[25:03.88]I hit him like in his fucking skirt.
[25:05.18]I didn't even hit him.
[25:07.14]Bullshit.
[25:08.90]God.
[25:15.43]He's like so impatient.
[25:18.33]Like the name of the Dark Souls game is just be fucking patient.
[25:22.38]Alright, you know what to do.
[25:24.92]Get him!
[25:27.80]This doesn't even like hurt him.
[25:31.38]That move is not good against him.
[25:32.94]My mana bar is gone.
[25:37.41]Better off just swinging at him normally.
[25:45.03]Uh-oh.
[25:45.41]Uh-oh.
[25:50.17]Doing, like, stupid, like, skateboarding moves.
[25:54.99]Nice job.
[25:55.73]Alright.
[25:56.17]Smash him.
[25:59.35]Back off.
[25:59.71]Back off.
[26:00.47]Back off.
[26:01.51]You're gonna get killed.
[26:07.37]Oh, shit.
[26:08.43]Snedekant.
[26:15.68]This guy's gonna die.
[26:19.03]Oh, fuck my pants.
[26:20.93]No, no, no, no, no.
[26:21.87]Alright.
[26:22.39]Quiet.
[26:22.81]Time to go.
[26:23.89]Wipe my greasy hands off.
[26:37.62]Stupid wind chime is still shooting me.
[26:39.60]I'm gonna die.
[26:56.58]Don't you do it.
[26:58.86]He's gonna teleport, he's gonna hit me.
[27:00.92]Lock onto him, my god!
[27:02.02]I'm on my way.
[27:22.29]Does he have more health?
[27:35.11]I feel like he has more HP.
[27:39.24]I can't fucking... We gotta bring... The problem is we didn't have Peach.
[27:43.88]We didn't have Princess Peach that time.
[27:52.72]life sucks that guy just put a FailFish that guy just put a FailFish he's gone forever get rid of him three people increases HP oh yeah that's true so wait if three people come in and two people die I have to fight him with two times as much health is that what has to happen
[28:22.59]Boo, the problem here, Boo, is this character sucks.
[28:27.31]You see me on my Dex character.
[28:32.28]I can't even do it, I tried.
[28:35.62]Hey, look at this guy!
[28:40.63]See a bunch of failfishes and I'm getting fucking mad.
[28:47.07]I made this, yeah, this is like a second playthrough character.
[28:50.51]No, where's the guy with the wheel?
[28:51.51]Where's the Staticat?
[28:54.68]Alright, get in here, Snattercat.
[28:56.34]You gotta use that wheel.
[29:00.36]Ban the chat.
[29:01.36]Clear the chat.
[29:02.04]Clear it.
[29:03.90]Clear the chat.
[29:04.74]I don't want to see it.
[29:05.37]Clear it.
[29:06.99]I'll do it.
[29:07.39]Fine.
[29:07.61]You want me to do it?
[29:08.93]You don't think I'll do it?
[29:13.49]Cleared.
[29:18.13]Alright, let's go, Snattercat.
[29:21.24]Did he leave?
[29:22.06]I think he left.
[29:22.94]He already left.
[29:27.77]No, who else is coming in here?
[29:29.55]This guy, Cake.
[29:30.99]Cake is coming in.
[29:36.79]Let's get FBI Agent Leon.
[29:39.41]Okay.
[29:50.97]Big two-handers take a long time to swing.
[29:54.55]Alright, you guys ready?
[29:56.94]Now remember, neither one of you die.
[30:00.40]If anybody dies, it makes it worse.
[30:02.74]You understand?
[30:03.96]You understand?
[30:04.42]Let's get it on, gentlemen.
[30:11.45]Just wanted to show you that little trick before we go.
[30:18.97]Here we go, you ready?
[30:21.92]No fucking around.
[30:23.82]Buff up.
[30:25.04]That's right.
[30:25.76]Buff the fuck up.
[30:26.62]Let's go.
[30:29.08]Teleports instantly.
[30:31.98]I still got hit by it because I couldn't lock onto it.
[30:33.99]Oh shit, ran out of juice.
[30:49.57]Just spam this down so we can really double team the hell out of them.
[30:55.78]Oh my god, he has so much health.
[30:57.84]I think it might just be more efficient just to cast these.
[31:06.81]Alright, we got three alive for the second phase.
[31:15.48]Alright, guys.
[31:16.74]Bring it on.
[31:17.14]Let's do it.
[31:20.38]I just tried to lock onto my own guys.
[31:31.28]Top myself off.
[31:37.17]No, he did it right in the fire.
[31:38.65]Alright.
[31:42.79]Let's get him locked on here.
[31:44.89]Please lock onto him.
[31:46.34]My God.
[31:55.16]Here it comes.
[31:56.74]Here it comes.
[32:05.63]Here it comes!
[32:07.65]Alright, get him!
[32:09.49]Murder him!
[32:14.10]He has so much health, holy shit.
[32:17.76]Holy shit, dude.
[32:23.64]This guy's got a billion HP.
[32:32.99]Look at these pros.
[32:38.22]God, that guy's destroying him.
[32:45.48]Spam him!
[32:46.24]Spam!
[32:46.82]Kill him!
[32:47.66]Get in here and kill him!
[32:48.36]Don't let him do it again!
[32:50.04]Do it!
[32:51.22]Don't let him do it!
[32:52.16]Don't let him do it!
[32:53.10]Nice job.
[33:05.25]That was actually terrifying.
[33:09.05]Wow, look at this FBI.
[33:10.17]FBI agent did a bunch of damage.
[33:13.29]And the onion did.
[33:13.99]You guys were great.
[33:15.27]Very good work, guys.
[33:16.87]But watch, watch.
[33:17.57]I can do this.
[33:19.80]And I can do this, too.
[33:22.70]Cool, huh?
[33:26.64]What an easy game.
[33:27.90]Got him on the first try.
[33:31.80]Hey, thank you, RedRider258 for the subscription.
[33:34.92]And BertramBot, thanks for subbing, dude.
[33:40.64]FailFish dude like something about FailFish I don't know what it is like I'm gonna give you some insight right if I'm playing this game and I'm like really getting frustrated like like the DLC area for instance right when I play through the DLC area I would die badly and in a way that I knew I probably could have prevented but I was like you know trying and I was losing and I look over in the chat I see like four like fail fishes
[34:06.54]It's just like my lips are pushed together, and I'm just like, you guys don't even understand.
[34:13.94]This is fucking hard.
[34:24.91]I just might.
[34:26.23]You can tell, too, right?
[34:27.27]Here's the voice.
[34:27.77]The voice changes.
[34:29.19]So here's how the voice changes.
[34:30.11]Ready?
[34:31.77]This is somebody talking normally, right?
[34:35.29]That's normal speaking.
[34:36.77]You can always tell when something's bad because here comes the lips are curled in now.
[34:41.59]Like this.
[34:42.05]The lips are kind of curled in.
[34:52.44]Easy game.
[34:53.12]You're just bad.
[34:54.09]Stop it.
[34:57.35]Stop it.
[34:57.99]Stop it.
[34:58.53]Stop it.
[35:03.10]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[35:04.01]It doesn't make me mad.
[35:05.79]I look over and I see Failfish and I smile.
[35:09.15]I go, damn!
[35:11.05]See, like, right there.
[35:11.83]Like, right now, someone's really gonna put a Failfish and be like, what a fucking idiot.
[35:15.33]Go up, like, one more step, stupid.
[35:17.28]And I'm just gonna be like, I'm just fucking trying!
[35:27.15]What can I even do with this?
[35:29.07]Aha, that's it.
[35:32.48]A soul of the twin prince who gives a shit.
[35:38.19]Is that all really it?
[35:39.87]Lothric's holy sword is the only thing you can get here?
[35:44.87]Well, that's his faith.
[35:54.29]This guy is useless to me now.
[35:55.59]Might as well just slash him.
[36:10.38]You fool!
[36:14.73]Jermit is a fraud.
[36:15.75]FailFish.
[36:16.59]Frisky moose.
[36:17.15]Thanks for the bits.
[36:18.35]Jermit has another sword.
[36:19.29]Is there really?
[36:20.07]How did I not see it?
[36:20.77]What are you talking about?
[36:25.13]I need to make this character not suck.
[36:28.40]He needs like 25 endurance.
[36:30.76]That's how he knows.
[36:32.02]Free souls to kill him.
[36:36.56]Thank you, Estalix, for your subscription.
[36:40.83]There weren't two swords there.
[36:45.05]There is two swords.
[36:45.85]No, there isn't.
[36:47.73]Prove it to me.
[36:52.05]Thanks a lot for the resubs.
[36:52.95]Thanks for the bits, too.
[36:53.65]A lot of people have been giving bits.
[36:54.71]Appreciate it, guys.
[36:57.01]I think I'm at the end of the game.
[37:07.93]I would like to use this whip.
[37:09.29]Seems fun.
[37:15.26]So it was useless to me?
[37:17.14]I don't even need it.
[37:18.84]I gotta just put the guy's head up here and then I can just go to the last area, right?
[37:25.26]Although I haven't done the DLC area yet on this guy.
[37:27.62]So.
[37:28.89]Alright, who do I need to put it on?
[37:29.83]This one, right?
[37:30.65]Did I already?
[37:31.17]Yeah.
[37:35.75]To make the character not suck, you need a new player.
[37:43.00]How dare you?
[37:44.66]How dare you say those things?
[37:51.13]Come on, give me at least a little bit of credit, guys.
[37:54.49]Dark Souls is hard.
[37:58.09]Especially hard when there's a bunch of people watching you and you know that they're judging your every move.
[38:03.53]I know every step I take, everywhere I look,
[38:09.24]Someone's always looking and always watching.
[38:11.26]So if I do something wrong, it's like... You idiot.
[38:18.22]Who am I missing here?
[38:20.92]Holy King Lothric.
[38:21.72]Don't I... Oh, I need to be over here.
[38:28.74]You should have turned left.
[38:30.50]Extra hard when you suck.
[38:32.97]Where's Boo?
[38:33.57]Boo, are you in here?
[38:35.59]Boo, everyone's making fun of me.
[38:43.88]I had uneven bits.
[38:45.44]Thanks, Mink.
[38:49.25]Mm-hmm.
[38:54.61]Okey-dokey.
[38:56.13]Although I kind of don't want to do that yet.
[39:00.24]Okay, I wanted to go to the DLC area.
[39:06.78]Boo, damn.
[39:07.86]Boo isn't even here to save me.
[39:13.04]You wanna fight me as a boss?
[39:19.27]Fuck this, we've already seen this before.
[39:20.47]I still have to kill Champion Gondar in the DLC area.
[39:32.94]Is there any enemies out here I can get souls with?
[39:34.60]I don't think there is, is there?
[39:38.96]Kiln of the First Flame.
[39:43.65]No, I don't think there is.
[39:46.15]Just like a long highway to the last boss, isn't it?
[39:59.60]Yes, it killed the first flame.
[40:02.66]Not doing this right now.
[40:04.54]Just want to light the fire.
[40:11.26]What would my boss weapon be?
[40:15.09]Uh, hold down right.
[40:16.27]It would be like a zero damage weapon.
[40:20.65]Be like a little knife.
[40:21.55]Tiny little knife.
[40:23.25]You'd hold down right trigger or left trigger for its move.
[40:26.74]And your character explodes.
[40:29.42]And does a thousand damage to everything in the circle.
[40:32.76]Or ten thousand damage.
[40:39.01]And your ghost can like hang out for like a couple minutes.
[40:41.23]So if you kill a boss with it, you get credit for it.
[40:51.03]Alright, I need to do... Where is it?
[40:56.89]Cleansing Chapel.
[40:59.81]Only 10,000.
[41:00.10]Yeah, like flames will just consume you and like... Like a big arcane missile bomb will just blow up out of you.
[41:18.21]Thanks, Clown Joke, for your sub.
[41:19.95]Thank you, Red Gear Pro, for the sub.
[41:21.26]Welcome, dude.
[41:24.68]What happens if you kill this guy?
[41:33.16]Does he drop something?
[41:35.42]Don't all the weird NPCs drop an item?
[41:39.64]I'm pretty sure they do.
[41:42.00]I've been here once before, so...
[41:45.59]Let's just kill this guy and see if he drops something.
[41:50.42]Do it.
[41:50.78]Kill him.
[41:52.28]Does he actually drop something good?
[41:54.94]Hold on.
[41:59.97]Not yet.
[42:01.21]Do it.
[42:01.49]Do it.
[42:01.75]Do it.
[42:05.47]He drops Regret.
[42:13.19]Killing him locks you out of the DLC.
[42:15.49]Well, good.
[42:15.95]I was about to hit R1 multiple times.
[42:34.10]Thank you, Carson.
[42:35.44]Welcome.
[42:36.16]Welcome.
[42:36.50]Thank you for subscriptions.
[42:38.38]Thank you for subscriptions.
[42:41.88]That floor sign says, try finger butthole.
[42:45.72]Of course it does.
[42:52.44]Hello.
[42:57.38]I've already seen you.
[43:03.83]Ah, Ashen One.
[43:04.61]This place is actually going to be hell, I think, as this character.
[43:08.57]It was hell on the other character.
[43:13.05]Alright, you guys have seen me play through the DLC already.
[43:15.81]I already did it.
[43:18.17]I already beat this whole dumb, awful, 4 out of 10 game.
[43:23.19]I need to stop saying that because somebody might just be here watching because they like Dark Souls.
[43:30.22]And they hear some random asshole be like, this game sucks.
[43:34.06]I'm absolutely going to summon this guy.
[43:37.50]No, the game doesn't suck, by the way.
[43:39.16]I love this game.
[43:41.34]If you're new, sometimes we just say game sucks.
[43:49.08]Is there anything else I haven't done?
[43:53.98]Wait for this one guy to get in.
[44:03.63]I love this guy's using the giant cartoon hammer.
[44:05.71]That's amazing to me.
[44:09.99]And we'll get Elias in here.
[44:14.19]But what if the game actually sucks?
[44:15.41]Well, yeah, then that's true.
[44:16.99]But this game doesn't suck.
[44:18.71]Except it does.
[44:20.67]I hate this game.
[44:22.83]More than anything.
[44:23.43]I hate it.
[44:28.29]Thank you, Sassy Jesus.
[44:29.47]Welcome.
[44:29.87]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[44:33.33]We're waiting for this guy.
[44:34.46]There he is.
[44:38.80]Okay.
[44:40.50]Let's do it.
[44:41.20]Let's blow through the DLC.
[44:42.36]Okay.
[44:46.98]I, like, remember everywhere to go now.
[44:49.34]Straight left, straight right.
[44:59.15]That fucking giant hammer is so dumb.
[45:02.15]Why can't I be that character?
[45:04.34]That guy's playing the character I want to play.
[45:10.50]Solo her this time.
[45:11.46]Not on this character.
[45:14.72]I'm not going to want to do it on this guy.
[45:20.16]We just got invaded by a Snattercat.
[45:25.24]How did we get invaded by a Snattercat?
[45:29.18]That doesn't even make any sense.
[45:31.16]He just like got in here.
[45:32.96]Where's the Snattercat?
[45:33.94]We're in like a fucking forest too.
[45:35.68]That makes it even more funny.
[45:36.78]I have no idea where he is.
[45:48.78]Can we all come down here?
[45:49.60]I hope so.
[45:52.49]A giant wolf is going to show up here.
[45:55.25]He's going to be invisible too, isn't he?
[45:57.95]In the forest, invaded by a Snaticat.
[46:01.99]What the hell even is life anymore?
[46:04.07]I'm not sure.
[46:08.91]I'm going to sneeze, but I can't even take my hands off the controller because I'll die.
[46:14.40]There he is.
[46:15.30]There's the Snaticat.
[46:21.23]Is he actually going to fight us?
[46:22.71]Just hang out with us, Snaticat.
[46:25.05]Look, I'm going to cast Yap.
[46:27.61]Y-A-P.
[46:29.15]I fucking forgot.
[46:41.84]Oh, God.
[46:44.01]No.
[46:45.21]No.
[46:50.38]Fucking dumb weapon.
[46:52.44]Actually, I don't really like this weapon.
[46:53.53]Get out of here.
[46:54.45]Get out of here.
[47:02.57]This guy's shooting a bow.
[47:03.81]He's trying to get away.
[47:06.15]Can he even fight the enemies?
[47:08.03]Alright, let him live.
[47:08.93]Let him live.
[47:11.54]Let him live.
[47:13.42]Can he actually hurt things in here?
[47:14.96]Because we can have three people here fighting.
[47:22.77]Throwing grenades at him.
[47:23.85]Alright, I'll end this once and for all.
[47:26.69]You guys want me to cast fucking zap?
[47:28.95]Cast zap!
[47:33.03]I got six stamina.
[47:34.23]That was a six stamina cast.
[47:35.49]I'm gonna get him.
[47:39.71]Why is this more interesting to me than playing the DLC right now?
[47:43.51]Come on, let's get that shenanigan.
[47:48.09]I'm gonna get him.
[47:49.19]I'm gonna get him.
[47:50.69]I'm gonna get him.
[47:53.60]He's trying to get to a position where he can hide.
[47:55.36]Ooh, almost zapped him.
[47:59.41]I love how easy the open world areas are in Dark Souls with more than one person.
[48:13.80]You're barely playing a video game.
[48:21.74]Nice lock on.
[48:22.34]Good job.
[48:50.08]What an absolute shit show this is with three people in a game I'm stuck!
[49:00.32]How did he miss me?
[49:01.62]How did he miss me?
[49:05.24]Oh, he missed.
[49:06.22]But he did.
[49:07.83]Ow.
[49:25.71]Almost.
[49:27.55]Oh shit.
[49:28.57]Not good.
[49:29.61]Keep him away from me.
[49:31.52]Keep this dreaded Snaticat away from me.
[49:34.18]Fucking seriously.
[49:35.30]Can you stop doing that guy?
[49:42.79]Watch out.
[49:43.17]Watch out.
[49:43.49]Big guy.
[49:44.01]Huge guy.
[49:44.55]Big viking.
[50:06.46]Of course the big guy had to be holding up this fucking giant mace right when that happened.
[50:14.05]Aye, aye, aye.
[50:18.16]I'm fucking killing this guy.
[50:20.92]Taking it out on him.
[50:35.00]I feel bad now.
[50:35.76]I don't want to kill him.
[50:39.40]Death by Snattercat.
[50:40.54]Yeah.
[50:41.78]No refinding.
[50:43.78]Hey, thanks, RadicalSlaw.
[50:45.72]Welcome.
[50:46.04]Thanks for the sub.
[50:51.23]I love how easy... Well, it's easy when you don't have a Snattercat chasing you.
[50:54.51]Alright, anybody else?
[50:55.95]Who else?
[50:56.31]It's...
[50:58.71]Okay, I kind of just shot myself in the face right there by bringing in this mad phantom.
[51:07.08]Yeah, absolutely, this person has to protect me.
[51:12.87]We're going to get invaded again.
[51:13.83]It's going to be a bloodbath.
[51:15.29]It's going to be four people in this game fighting each other.
[51:27.83]Alright, there's him.
[51:28.75]Where's the mad phantom?
[51:33.33]Where is he?
[51:36.59]I don't see him.
[51:39.09]Why is he not being summoned?
[51:40.49]I love these giant turkey people.
[51:52.96]Did you hear that?
[51:53.46]What was that?
[51:56.97]Dried Finger?
[51:57.61]Alright, I'm gonna take Dried Finger.
[51:59.91]Do I have any?
[52:00.71]I might not have any on this character right now.
[52:04.81]No.
[52:05.21]I'm gonna go buy them.
[52:06.32]Did she sell them?
[52:09.22]Oh, there he is.
[52:14.66]He's just aggroing shit all over here, man.
[52:16.42]This guy's scaring the shit out of me.
[52:20.76]I know he's gonna do something.
[52:21.94]He's gonna get behind me and backstab me the second I turn around.
[52:26.06]Ow.
[52:35.23]I'm going to re-summon everybody.
[52:36.55]I want to do it with three people.
[52:42.61]Yeah.
[52:43.69]I'm going to banish everybody.
[52:49.50]Banish visiting phantoms.
[52:51.38]I do want to get the fingers.
[52:54.94]I will bring these two guys back in.
[52:57.24]With Snoopette and Pepe.
[53:03.58]I can't get rid of this guy.
[53:12.51]Get out of here.
[53:14.21]Why can I not get rid of him?
[53:22.55]I can't get rid of this guy?
[53:23.55]I just wasted an Ember.
[53:26.05]I'm not going to waste an Ember on this guy.
[53:30.86]No way.
[53:38.94]Get out of here.
[53:43.16]What's chugging Estus is?
[53:44.40]What's up with that?
[53:46.82]Chug it!
[53:48.44]He took an Estus Blast.
[53:52.52]Alright.
[53:55.90]I can move on.
[53:57.12]I'm gonna go get a finger.
[54:00.94]He's gonna get rid of you, I know, really.
[54:06.59]Fist fight?
[54:08.09]No, I'm not wasting a goddamn ember fist fighting a guy and have him just instantly kill me somehow.
[54:18.50]Online matchmaking?
[54:21.28]Alright, bony finger.
[54:25.66]Let's get a smorgasbord of people in here.
[54:28.44]Can I even buy them from her?
[54:32.45]Have I even unlocked it?
[54:35.05]I don't think I can even buy them.
[54:41.52]Where do I go to do that?
[54:49.31]What ash is it, and how do I not have it?
[54:57.32]I passed it?
[54:57.82]Wait, was it in that menu?
[55:02.80]Huh?
[55:09.45]What?
[55:10.63]It's not in here.
[55:11.23]Oh, okay.
[55:15.15]It's grayed out.
[55:16.73]Dead finger.
[55:19.19]2,000 souls, you got it.
[55:20.33]I know, I know, I know.
[55:21.39]See, that's what I'm talking about.
[55:22.49]That's exactly what I was talking about.
[55:23.99]Everyone's going to make fun of me.
[55:29.70]What a fucking idiot.
[55:32.12]Let's strangle him.
[55:36.26]How many?
[55:36.92]I have one.
[55:47.06]Is this guy good at Dark Souls?
[55:48.30]Why does he have so many viewers?
[55:50.95]Yeah, I'm really good at Dark Souls.
[55:52.13]That's why there's people here.
[55:53.07]Alright, let's get this thing equipped.
[56:00.21]Put it on the dead finger.
[56:08.03]Alright.
[56:09.33]Let's do it.
[56:17.72]Into the snowy field.
[56:18.74]Password is Slurp.
[56:24.62]Good at Dark Souls?
[56:25.79]Laughing.
[56:26.91]Hey, I beat the game.
[56:29.25]This is my second time playing through it, and I... I beat this whole game by myself when it launched.
[56:34.49]At launch, didn't have any help, didn't know where I was going.
[56:37.77]You guys watched me play through the whole game.
[56:41.47]I don't want to hear it.
[56:44.57]I don't want to hear it.
[56:46.51]Wait, where's the... I want to bring in the person I had there last time.
[56:53.09]It was the big fat turkey lady.
[56:57.36]That's not the turkey lady.
[56:59.42]God, there are so many signs here.
[57:00.48]I'm not even sure I'm going to be able to see her again.
[57:03.42]Is that the turkey?
[57:04.66]Yeah.
[57:07.54]Do I have to use this before summoning somebody?
[57:09.72]Or can I use it after?
[57:17.03]Good memories.
[57:30.46]We had Dorpers in the game last night.
[57:33.96]Did I summon Quinton?
[57:39.98]This guy.
[57:40.46]We'll get cake in here again.
[57:42.26]And I can use the finger.
[57:46.00]Watching the first playthrough was a riot.
[57:48.52]Thanks, Mink.
[57:55.66]I love this game.
[57:57.49]Bloodborne's more fun for me, though.
[58:01.08]Okay, we got another guy.
[58:02.18]Where's the mad phantom?
[58:08.51]Here we go.
[58:09.37]Are you duel building?
[58:13.01]With the cartoon weapons?
[58:14.05]That's crazy.
[58:16.65]That is actually insane.
[58:25.79]And looking for the last... There he is.
[58:28.64]Alright, minions.
[58:32.75]Let's go.
[58:33.77]Let's go beat the DLC.
[58:34.93]Here's the goal.
[58:35.71]Ready, guys?
[58:36.97]These three compatriots, we're going to beat the whole DLC without dying.
[58:41.18]You understand?
[58:44.44]Whole DLC.
[58:46.24]Nobody die.
[58:47.52]You got it?
[58:48.52]Good.
[58:49.56]Stop the timer now.
[58:53.32]I never said it was timed.
[58:54.62]Slow down.
[58:55.62]Stop the timer.
[58:57.88]Take it easy.
[58:59.80]All stay as a collective unit.
[59:01.14]Don't stray far away from each other.
[59:03.66]Stay right next to each other.
[59:06.10]If you're not touching bodies with one person, then you are not doing it wrong.
[59:13.44]We need to be a moving force.
[59:19.32]We have to move as if we are a party in Dragon Age.
[59:29.07]Nice, going good so far.
[59:34.33]That lady isn't awake yet.
[59:35.23]Are these guys watching the stream?
[59:40.28]Yeah.
[59:40.46]Because we have a password.
[59:46.68]Okay.
[59:47.84]Stay shoulder to shoulder.
[59:52.38]Dogs are coming.
[59:53.18]Don't break formation.
[59:54.27]Keep formation.
[59:56.31]Cake.
[59:56.97]Cake, don't break formation.
[60:01.49]Somebody broke formation and ruined everything.
[60:03.50]That was really, really close to being bad.
[60:07.38]Alright, forward.
[60:09.68]To me.
[60:13.23]Shoulders.
[60:13.53]Slowly.
[60:16.59]Slowly.
[60:27.61]We can't lose.
[60:28.97]We can't lose like this.
[60:31.07]It's not possible.
[60:34.45]Wait, let me just get the item.
[60:35.95]Okay.
[60:37.13]Here comes one wolf.
[60:38.65]You know what to do, guys.
[60:40.29]Easy.
[60:41.17]Don't break formation.
[60:42.11]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[60:44.76]Don't break formation.
[60:45.60]Kill him.
[60:47.80]Keep formation.
[60:49.54]Stay together.
[60:51.10]Stay together.
[60:53.58]It didn't even say that guy came into the game.
[60:58.71]Don't break the fucking formation.
[61:06.92]This is like scary.
[61:11.74]What is that noise?
[61:15.19]Okay, good.
[61:16.99]Shoulder to shoulder.
[61:20.07]Wait, what the fuck is happening?
[61:22.71]Hold on, there's two people here?
[61:29.21]I don't even know who's who.
[61:30.35]Alright, it's time to really show them why we picked sorcery to begin with.
[61:41.95]That's why we do it.
[61:58.43]Open world Dark Souls PvP.
[62:00.63]I never thought there'd be such a thing.
[62:02.27]Holy shit, that almost would have insta-killed me.
[62:04.33]Alright, be good.
[62:10.22]Oops, I didn't want to do that.
[62:14.78]Bring us your worst.
[62:16.88]Alright, we're gonna change plans here.
[62:19.96]I need to stay alive at all costs.
[62:26.10]No fucking around.
[62:30.05]You guys keep me alive.
[62:33.85]Let's go.
[62:36.38]If I die, I'm really gonna call bullshit on all three of you.
[62:44.70]Two shields.
[62:46.72]Keep me protected.
[62:47.46]I heard somebody.
[62:49.52]Did you guys hear that?
[62:54.75]The name of the game is... Don't let me die.
[63:00.30]Oh, here comes a mad spirit.
[63:01.58]You guys know what to do.
[63:03.74]Stick together.
[63:05.38]Wait for his assault.
[63:09.75]When he comes.
[63:12.43]Eradicate.
[63:15.59]Yeah, yeah, good, good.
[63:16.89]Very good formation.
[63:17.67]I like it.
[63:23.24]Man.
[63:26.00]Put on the fucking huge thing.
[63:41.50]No, we're like the heavy pants.
[63:43.14]I don't think I even have the wing knight stuff.
[63:46.61]There we go.
[63:52.01]Alright, keep moving.
[63:56.49]Keep moving.
[63:58.43]This is as fast as I can walk.
[63:59.53]I can't even roll.
[64:06.32]My guy just doesn't burp and then fall.
[64:08.78]Keep me alive.
[64:12.70]Protect me at all costs.
[64:15.16]Otherwise, you have to go home.
[64:19.06]This is an escort mission.
[64:24.17]Uh-oh.
[64:25.23]Uh-oh.
[64:25.49]Excuse me.
[64:26.37]Excuse me.
[64:26.91]He's gotten through.
[64:28.29]He got through.
[64:30.71]What about the other guy?
[64:31.27]What about the other guy?
[64:32.83]I don't know which way to turn.
[64:36.43]What is that noise?
[64:38.73]Don't die.
[64:39.78]Don't die.
[64:43.08]Oh my god!
[64:44.22]How did you let this happen?
[64:45.78]How did you let this happen?
[64:47.62]Hold on, how did you... I can't... Don't let this happen!
[64:57.23]Kill him!
[64:58.69]Smash his head in!
[65:06.01]Oh, he's gonna get behind us.
[65:07.27]What?
[65:07.93]Oh shit, one of my fucking bodyguards died.
[65:12.35]This is not good.
[65:14.85]Fuck.
[65:21.63]Alright, good, good.
[65:22.23]You're doing good work over there, stupid.
[65:24.29]Keep him busy.
[65:26.28]Don't.
[65:28.04]Easy.
[65:28.36]I can't even move.
[65:36.22]Oh shit!
[65:37.06]No!
[65:37.98]Oh god!
[65:38.84]Oh god, I think I'm gonna be down to one bodyguard!
[65:43.96]Get the fuck away from me!
[65:49.58]No!
[65:50.42]No!
[65:51.38]No!
[65:52.08]It's over!
[66:00.19]Kill him!
[66:01.89]Don't let- Are you gonna let him get away with that shit?
[66:13.35]I can't believe it.
[66:14.17]Alright, I know what the problem was.
[66:17.87]The problem was my shields weren't big enough.
[66:20.14]That was the main issue.
[66:26.48]I found out the problem, guys.
[66:27.58]I didn't have... I wasn't the smite character.
[66:37.79]Alright, that's the name of the game.
[66:40.51]Where are my other protectors?
[66:47.47]I'm not summoning a mad phantom.
[66:48.51]Are you kidding me?
[66:48.97]Alright.
[66:51.13]Cake.
[66:51.38]We're going to give an opportunity to another person.
[66:53.20]Alright.
[66:54.52]Balthier.
[67:00.14]And... Oh, that guy had a huge turkey leg.
[67:04.36]Damn.
[67:09.63]Look at this.
[67:10.75]I am impenetrable.
[67:12.67]Nobody will ever stop me now.
[67:20.61]Alright.
[67:21.67]Where's my last defender?
[67:27.97]And I will pick one.
[67:31.43]And Sir Slurl.
[67:34.25]Wait, wasn't that guy in the last game?
[67:36.33]Well, still.
[67:36.77]We'll get this guy in here.
[67:38.99]Alright, welcome to you three.
[67:40.66]Thank you for joining us.
[67:41.44]We're playing the escort the fat guy to the next checkpoint.
[67:45.92]So... Yeah.
[67:50.59]Good luck.
[67:54.34]I'm so slow right now.
[67:59.58]SomeBitTripFan, thanks for the sub.
[68:01.08]Tony Spagoni, 1, 2, 3, thanks for subbing.
[68:05.50]NeedsMeek and DrCheese, thanks both of you guys for the bits.
[68:07.42]Don't forget to build Rod of Tahootie.
[68:11.20]What was that guy's name?
[68:11.88]Cabrakan.
[68:12.82]This is Cabrakan.
[68:15.56]From Smite.
[68:17.90]Alright, guys.
[68:18.54]Good luck.
[68:20.72]Holy shit, I wish I could run.
[68:27.48]Why does one guy have to be the Dorito?
[68:33.10]Checkpoint.
[68:33.70]Lead me to the checkpoint.
[68:40.97]People are straying a little too far away from me.
[68:45.55]And somebody just threw a spear.
[68:48.29]You guys are going to let that guy throw a spear.
[68:51.66]I don't know about this group.
[69:00.09]Does he fat roll?
[69:00.87]No, I can't even roll at all.
[69:10.78]Dude, this guy is naked with a fucking whip and like a mask on.
[69:14.46]One of those like sexual masks.
[69:25.11]Alright.
[69:26.71]I'm not the leader here.
[69:31.41]Once we get over this horizon, this is where it all goes to shit.
[69:40.78]I really think it's going to be actually pretty hard for people to kill me.
[69:43.98]Can I be backstabbed with a shield on my back?
[69:45.40]I hope not.
[69:49.84]My god, I just kind of... Ugh, this is so unbearable.
[69:52.55]I wish I could at least run...
[69:58.36]Oh, oh, excuse me.
[70:05.21]I got my eyes on the perpetrator.
[70:09.21]Thanks a lot, Robin.
[70:11.79]Don't get too overzealous here, guys.
[70:13.55]We have a bunch of wolves now.
[70:20.52]To the left side, being surrounded here.
[70:26.02]Do not let him get in close.
[70:27.95]He's in close.
[70:31.99]This guy with the two giant paper mache weapons.
[70:37.76]I'm going to keep going.
[70:39.30]Just like every other escort quest.
[70:41.44]I'm going to keep walking.
[70:45.48]Excuse me.
[70:45.96]I need some help.
[70:47.54]Excuse me.
[70:55.05]There's one random fucking dog here.
[70:58.33]I'm gonna keep walking.
[71:01.05]If you guys ever played World of Warcraft, I just keep going.
[71:08.80]This is such a shit show.
[71:09.92]That guy just ran by me.
[71:11.08]I'm about to have a man down.
[71:19.91]What am I even looking at here?
[71:23.66]A dog's jump.
[71:25.63]Help!
[71:26.17]Help, help, help!
[71:34.29]This is so dumb.
[71:37.12]We have to get to the next bonfire.
[71:41.96]Oh, fight the fir- Are we gonna fight the first boss like this?
[71:44.20]What are you doing, man?
[71:47.88]This wolf is seriously freaking me out.
[71:53.37]Nice work.
[71:56.83]Tank isn't holding aggro.
[71:59.16]I know, I really wasn't.
[72:01.64]We didn't kill either one of them either.
[72:03.52]They're both still alive.
[72:06.42]Almost at my souls.
[72:07.74]We've almost made it to the checkpoint.
[72:14.04]This guy with the whip is crazy.
[72:15.40]I love this dude.
[72:19.61]Them great shields work even worse for you.
[72:21.87]I know, right?
[72:24.01]But it's part of the character.
[72:25.51]It's part of the joke.
[72:26.40]So it has to stay on.
[72:32.60]Alright, here comes your first real test.
[72:34.78]We have a scary enemy and two bad guys.
[72:37.85]Good luck.
[72:42.83]Hello?
[72:43.69]Hello?
[72:44.81]Wow, what a save.
[72:47.57]What a save that was.
[72:49.36]Unbelievable work.
[72:52.27]Perfect job.
[72:53.89]You guys deserve a medal.
[73:00.95]This guy's pushing the payload.
[73:03.16]I am the payload.
[73:06.54]Ooh.
[73:07.86]Uh-oh.
[73:10.98]Uh-oh.
[73:14.90]Somebody died.
[73:15.52]Who died?
[73:15.94]Oh, he did.
[73:16.54]Yeah, you guys did it.
[73:27.73]No wait a minute I get a drink Oh my god, oh god Here comes another guy here comes a dog too These guys are handling this pretty well
[73:54.14]I can't backstab him like this?
[73:57.08]What am I doing?
[73:57.62]What the fuck was that?
[74:05.94]There's another phantom here, there's another bad phantom.
[74:09.51]I can't, I can't dodge, I can't dodge.
[74:16.43]My goodness gracious.
[74:19.21]How did you do that already?
[74:24.87]This is like the most fun I've had in Dark Souls DLC.
[74:27.21]Nice whip.
[74:35.29]Uh-oh.
[74:36.86]Are we actually gonna get in the tower?
[74:40.68]Wait, I need that item.
[74:43.26]Hold on.
[74:43.98]I gotta get that item.
[74:47.34]No!
[74:47.78]Alright, that actually helped.
[74:49.48]Thank you for doing that.
[74:54.14]Watch out.
[74:55.18]I can tank these.
[74:56.70]Don't worry about me.
[74:57.28]Don't worry about yourself.
[75:00.68]Alright, we're going to keep going.
[75:01.86]The right way is this way, right?
[75:02.86]Let me get to full health.
[75:11.13]There's still an invader over there attacking.
[75:12.99]Alright, keep escorting.
[75:18.74]I'm glad I did all that for a heavy gem.
[75:23.41]Are we going the right way?
[75:24.89]I completely forget.
[75:25.79]You don't go in the tower.
[75:30.46]You go in the tower?
[75:31.22]I thought you don't go in the tower.
[75:37.38]Alright.
[75:38.20]Somebody just put the difficulty slider up.
[75:41.84]Somebody put up the difficulty slider.
[75:47.14]Somebody put up the difficulty slider.
[75:48.36]Come on.
[75:54.95]I'm running away.
[75:57.15]Difficulty slider is up.
[76:10.07]It's now on hard mode.
[76:22.48]Oh no, one of the phantom slides.
[76:30.28]Don't let him up!
[76:31.58]Kick him!
[76:32.02]Kick him in the face!
[76:33.58]Kick him in the face!
[76:35.28]Kick him in the face!
[76:38.12]Slide down and fucking butt-stop him.
[76:41.98]Don't let him up here.
[76:45.97]You gotta have to fight him off, dude.
[76:47.09]He's gonna kill me.
[76:49.31]Fight him off.
[76:51.23]Right in the face.
[76:53.81]Fight the... No, shit.
[76:58.90]No, no, no, no.
[77:01.34]Fucking punch him.
[77:25.45]He actually lived He landed flat on his back Oh my god, that was fucking hilarious He had an opportunity He could have kicked the guy down
[77:50.94]He could have, like, booted the guy's face.
[77:54.08]No, he did like the... Oh, shit!
[77:58.40]And fell flat on his back.
[78:01.49]Ugh.
[78:03.05]That was fucking hilarious.
[78:05.33]I'm gonna run out of embers.
[78:08.57]Alright, you guys ready for the speedrun?
[78:11.71]Another three people.
[78:13.31]This time, we have to run as fast as we can to the boss.
[78:18.90]No stopping.
[78:19.52]And we have to stay shoulder to shoulder.
[78:24.24]I'm going to stay as naked guy, by the way.
[78:29.33]Oh, man.
[78:30.27]I'm sorry.
[78:31.33]This guy's name.
[78:32.13]Okay.
[78:35.55]Oh.
[78:37.35]I don't even know what happened.
[78:38.11]I tried to... I tried to attack with Square, and I just, like, dumped my drink on the ground.
[78:44.54]I just had a total panic moment.
[78:50.58]Alright, Snaticat, you wanna actually be on our team this time?
[79:00.02]Let's actually get Snaticat on the team, and we're gonna do the speedrun strat with the, uh, little, weird, scrawny guy.
[79:10.69]Alright.
[79:13.22]Once we get the last guy in, we have to line up shoulder to shoulder.
[79:17.56]And then we're sprinting to the checkpoint.
[79:19.38]We have to sprint to the boss.
[79:25.00]And... I don't see him.
[79:27.97]Oh shit, somebody's dropped 11 embers on the ground.
[79:30.23]Oh my god, thank you.
[79:32.83]Thank you for doing that.
[79:34.51]Whoa!
[79:34.87]I didn't know this guy was a circus actor.
[79:38.51]That's fucking awesome.
[79:40.89]There's way more circus acts.
[79:42.31]Alright, we're gonna have to go, uh, Bleed Juggle is gonna have to come in.
[79:47.87]Thank you, Quantum Pimple.
[79:50.67]And Mr. Peanut for the two months, thanks.
[79:53.00]Welcome back.
[79:54.52]Lots of progress being made in this stream.
[79:56.28]Well, I mean, I figure, like, three or four days ago, whatever it was, if I played through all the DLC for real, I kinda just wanna be that fuckin' shithead.
[80:08.43]I'm having fun doing this.
[80:12.02]This is making me... I'm enjoying my evening.
[80:14.84]Alright guys, you ready?
[80:16.48]So, on the count of three... I'm gonna compensate for the stream delay, so on the count of three we're sprinting forward and don't stop.
[80:23.98]And... Who wants to be the leader?
[80:27.28]We have to follow this person's every cue.
[80:29.41]Whoever it is.
[80:29.93]Okay, BleedJuggle?
[80:31.71]BleedJuggle, you are the leader.
[80:34.37]What that means is when I say three, you have to sprint and not stop moving.
[80:38.17]We all have to follow you shoulder to shoulder.
[80:39.85]We all have to go at the same time.
[80:41.39]Alright, so ready?
[80:42.72]One, two, three.
[80:52.36]Stream delay, stream delay, stream delay.
[80:58.59]One, two, three.
[81:04.64]Alright, one, two, okay, go!
[81:12.29]Go, go, go!
[81:14.81]Who said to fight?
[81:15.41]Who said to fight?
[81:23.97]Run, run, come on!
[81:30.00]Keep it up.
[81:31.42]No stopping.
[81:34.15]Follow Bleed Juggle, quickly!
[81:35.79]Still got everybody?
[81:37.01]Come on, come on, come on!
[81:38.99]Oh, fuck.
[81:43.57]Gah!
[81:45.75]We're gonna get the world record.
[81:46.76]This is so dumb, I love it.
[81:56.52]Somebody, okay, there's an invader here too, by the way.
[81:59.68]Somewhere in this area.
[82:01.68]There's a laggy dog running around in circles.
[82:05.19]You guys gotta keep up.
[82:12.73]Oh, that was risky.
[82:13.57]That was really risky.
[82:15.23]Forget about him.
[82:16.95]Too risky.
[82:23.65]Wow!
[82:31.70]I'm so glad I'm recording right now.
[82:34.72]Because this is going to be world record getting by.
[82:37.40]Into the next area.
[82:40.66]Okay.
[82:48.91]Almost there.
[82:52.03]Closer by the second.
[82:53.35]Did we lose a guy?
[82:53.95]Whoa!
[82:57.29]What?
[82:58.77]What the fuck?
[83:01.43]How did you do that that good?
[83:04.03]There's no fucking way you could have done that that well.
[83:06.79]I don't believe it.
[83:09.11]Across the bridge, quick!
[83:11.58]Get across the bridge and chop the bridge down!
[83:14.06]Quick, quick, quick, get across the bridge!
[83:17.02]Cut it down!
[83:17.58]Cut it!
[83:18.26]Cut it!
[83:18.94]Cut the bridge down!
[83:22.51]Get me over there.
[83:24.55]Get me across the bridge.
[83:38.64]Oh, shit.
[83:45.36]No.
[83:46.64]I thought I was at the edge.
[83:49.16]Fuck.
[83:53.51]I was a half step.
[83:58.33]I killed my own person.
[84:05.24]Why is this so fun?
[84:08.22]I thought we were going to get it gross.
[84:11.10]If I wasn't rolling, I was just so panicky.
[84:13.66]I should have just kept running.
[84:20.53]What I want to know is how in the wild world of sports did that guy time that jump to hit me?
[84:31.68]I will never know.
[84:32.60]That was unbelievable.
[84:40.17]It was truly unbelievable.
[84:46.70]Oh, we'll get this guy in.
[84:53.00]RIP 30,000 souls.
[84:54.60]Eh, whatever.
[85:01.28]One more, we'll try it again.
[85:02.22]Ah, somebody I haven't seen.
[85:12.01]Hello, very good.
[85:13.33]Okay.
[85:14.05]Sure thing.
[85:14.53]Hello, very good.
[85:19.31]Did nobody get summoned in the game?
[85:25.57]The only thing I get to wear, I can choose a couple pieces of armor.
[85:41.78]I can wear the towel.
[85:44.80]I just get out of the... Is that actually Star?
[85:48.68]Is Star actually still?
[85:51.47]What is he doing?
[85:55.14]That can't be the real Star.
[85:57.53]Star?
[85:57.99]That's not Star, guys.
[85:58.97]Star is in, like, fucking California right now.
[86:01.89]Oh, somebody hasn't seen.
[86:10.43]Uh, this guy.
[86:20.12]Unless he's on, like, a laptop, which... Maybe he is on a laptop in, like, a fucking hotel bedroom.
[86:29.57]Alright, we got one... Still only have one person here.
[86:32.67]There we go.
[86:32.95]There's two.
[86:33.27]Let's try getting this person in again.
[86:40.58]And then, same deal, guys.
[86:42.94]No, I don't like this hat.
[86:44.98]We need the grandma hat on.
[86:45.96]It's perfect.
[86:47.82]Alright, you guys gotta protect naked grandma.
[86:52.42]The storyline I'm gonna work here is that she broke out of the house.
[86:55.03]She didn't take her medicine.
[86:56.59]She's like 92.
[87:02.70]And she's shit-faced.
[87:04.16]Good luck.
[87:08.20]Alright, you ready?
[87:08.68]Line up.
[87:10.45]Shoulder to shoulder.
[87:14.09]The leader of this... Save drunk grandma... Is Quantum Pimple.
[87:19.49]Quantum Pimple, you are the leader.
[87:21.57]We're sprinting, following you.
[87:22.85]Three, two, one, go!
[87:24.69]Alright, I'm gonna pretend like there was no stream delay.
[87:27.87]Let's just go.
[87:28.27]Go, quick.
[87:35.27]Keep going, quick.
[87:36.61]We gotta get across that bridge, fast.
[87:41.47]Come on, let's go!
[87:43.65]What are you doing over there, dearie?
[87:49.08]What?
[87:49.66]Huh?
[87:51.08]Where's the guy?
[87:51.70]Come on, come on, come on.
[87:53.58]Come on, get down here, get down here, quick, quick, quick.
[87:55.58]Who the fuck is that?
[87:58.17]What?
[87:59.61]I thought that was a guy on my team.
[88:03.67]Oh shit, we lost a guy.
[88:06.09]This is gonna end real quick.
[88:09.05]Save me!
[88:09.81]Save me!
[88:11.87]I'm gonna get fucked up on pills!
[88:17.37]I'm going this way.
[88:19.60]Just keep running towards the bridge, sweetie.
[88:22.82]Oh, that's a scary little doggy, isn't it?
[88:28.32]You're my one and only protector.
[88:30.88]You gotta protect me from all the ancient evils!
[88:38.55]Get fucked up!
[88:43.27]I only have one bodyguard now.
[88:48.16]One bodyguard, and two people chasing behind me.
[88:50.80]Gee!
[88:57.51]Get us out of here, Quantum.
[88:59.86]Quantum pimple.
[89:03.56]He's still chasing us.
[89:04.52]Only two of them.
[89:05.60]There's two chasing.
[89:08.30]Get us out.
[89:37.08]I just got fucking instantly killed.
[89:44.03]We need to get across that bridge.
[89:46.53]Okay, first of all, we lost two bodyguards within like a minute.
[89:53.89]You gotta stick together.
[89:55.07]The last group was good because we were shoulder to shoulder.
[89:58.03]We were ready to go.
[90:04.66]Alright.
[90:05.58]Let's do it again.
[90:07.20]One of these groups has to get me across the bridge.
[90:14.93]Snoop Pet.
[90:15.43]Alright.
[90:16.07]A couple more faces we haven't seen yet.
[90:17.93]Sandman.
[90:18.57]We'll bring you in.
[90:23.79]I missed a couple of subs, I think.
[90:27.03]Let me go grab a drink, too.
[90:29.47]My throat is a little parched.
[90:33.43]Let me make sure I didn't miss anybody.
[90:34.51]I got Robin.
[90:37.43]0999.
[90:38.29]Mr. Peanut.
[90:41.03]Quantum Pimple subscribed.
[90:44.14]Oh, hey, it's BB.
[90:45.06]Thanks for two months.
[90:48.34]Feistel.
[90:48.80]Thanks for two months.
[90:49.66]World record, I believe.
[90:52.26]And then that was delicious for nine months.
[90:55.80]What do we name the baby?
[90:58.51]Drunk Grandma.
[91:00.33]And I'm going to grab a drink.
[91:01.51]I will be right back.
[91:03.61]I'll see you guys in a second.
[91:05.85]Getting some tea.
[91:07.49]One minute.
[91:10.45]I'm going to be real quick.
[91:13.45]Hello.
[91:52.27]Hello.
[92:39.22]Help me.
[92:59.03]Okay.
[92:59.31]I'm back.
[93:04.00]We didn't get ganked or anything?
[93:05.00]Good.
[93:07.98]Very good.
[93:11.85]Move some things around.
[93:15.93]And away we go.
[93:17.31]Couple more summons.
[93:18.93]Password.
[93:19.31]I'll show the password because there probably are a bunch of people here that we're not watching earlier.
[93:24.10]Password is slurp.
[93:26.18]S-L-U-R-P.
[93:29.86]Anyone in game, go get a bunch of enemies and lead them to Jerma.
[93:37.77]Frozen Crusader.
[93:38.43]We'll get this guy in.
[93:41.18]I'm actually surprised we haven't gotten to the bridge more than one time.
[93:45.43]Yeah.
[93:49.41]I love how the stream title is Sorcery.
[93:51.51]Or Sorcerer.
[93:56.33]When I'm just fucking, it's just tagged with Drunk Grandma.
[94:03.78]Ah, yes.
[94:05.80]Oh, we really gotta play this character right.
[94:07.60]Hold on.
[94:10.46]That guy's got a cool scythe.
[94:11.82]I like that, dude.
[94:14.54]Prince Johnny, come on in.
[94:18.71]So here we go.
[94:19.45]This is the name of the game.
[94:21.35]It's Escort Shitface Granny.
[94:25.27]Thanks a lot, Speedy.
[94:25.97]You're welcome.
[94:27.25]And Gnarl Apocalyptic Cheeseburger.
[94:29.61]Thank you.
[94:30.35]Both of you guys.
[94:32.33]Are you guys ready to really roleplay here?
[94:36.67]Remember, Grandma got out of the house.
[94:39.93]She wasn't supposed to be out.
[94:42.87]And she took, like, three bottles of whiskey with her, too.
[94:47.81]Are you guys prepared?
[94:50.73]Let's get up here.
[94:51.45]Let's get ready.
[94:53.81]And let's start the roleplay.
[94:55.05]Here we go.
[94:57.12]It's time to get out of the house for once in my life.
[94:59.92]I'm really ready to start...
[95:06.78]Let's go!
[95:10.26]Which way do I go?
[95:11.94]I don't know where I'm going.
[95:13.52]Is it this way?
[95:14.68]I'm not sure.
[95:17.59]There's a scary bad guy over there.
[95:22.67]I'm going to go this way.
[95:25.65]Yeah, this way sounds like a good plan.
[95:30.10]Oh, it's a little chilly out tonight.
[95:34.79]Oh, fuck, a scarecrow!
[95:37.63]Where is everybody?
[95:39.27]Where is my... I'm being chased!
[95:44.14]Holy shit, Granny's got some moves.
[95:47.98]Oh, no.
[95:48.66]Let me just... That was some good stuff.
[95:58.53]Let's go.
[96:00.13]I don't even know where I'm going.
[96:02.41]I think I'm going this way.
[96:04.13]Towards this scary, sunny peak.
[96:08.11]Get this guy away from me, please!
[96:12.32]Did we lose somebody already?
[96:14.22]Oh, fuck.
[96:20.62]This way.
[96:21.84]Over here.
[96:22.26]I only have one bodyguard left.
[96:27.42]Where are my bodyguards?
[96:30.90]Where are my bodyguards?
[96:33.47]This guy has been behind me the whole time.
[96:35.93]Whoa.
[96:42.09]Oh no!
[96:43.11]No!
[96:46.08]This guy's been up my ass the whole time.
[96:48.94]I'm going the wrong way.
[96:50.08]I'm going the wrong way.
[96:54.66]Which way is the right way?
[96:55.94]I forget.
[96:57.02]I'm like drunk in real life.
[96:58.84]I don't know where I'm going.
[97:05.58]I don't think we went the right way.
[97:10.62]Watch out!
[97:14.28]I think it's this way.
[97:16.77]Another bodyguard dead.
[97:20.11]I think it's just me.
[97:22.45]No, I got one guy.
[97:25.11]I'm just going down here.
[97:25.93]Fuck it.
[97:26.59]Let's do a variable.
[97:27.91]Colin, I'm dead.
[97:42.04]I like just got lost because I was running in circles.
[97:44.28]Alright, now Granny's gonna get armed.
[97:50.81]With the fucking pool cue.
[97:55.74]You want to get burned?
[97:56.60]I branded my husband's ass with this thing.
[98:05.66]No, this... That's a good grandma weapon.
[98:12.56]It's one of the canes.
[98:15.86]No.
[98:20.48]Yeah, I'm going with this.
[98:25.07]Let's do it.
[98:33.17]I'm ready to get burned.
[98:34.33]Alright, this time we gotta make it to the bridge.
[98:41.30]Somebody has to lead.
[98:48.50]Look at this guy.
[98:53.50]Let's get him in here again.
[98:54.40]He was good.
[98:55.54]This guy was good.
[99:00.32]Use the handmade dagger.
[99:02.65]Do I even have that here?
[99:06.09]There we go.
[99:06.49]Yeah.
[99:09.33]I'm gonna get slashed.
[99:13.73]Granny's not fucking around anymore.
[99:16.67]Oh, I gotta stab somebody right in the fucking ear with this thing.
[99:24.82]What?
[99:26.18]Easy.
[99:27.71]What is hurting him?
[99:29.69]Let's get Snoop out of here again.
[99:30.65]It's been a while.
[99:34.45]I don't think he can fuck around.
[99:38.77]I can't wait to do that to somebody.
[99:41.37]Dad judo's dough.
[99:42.36]Thanks for subbing.
[99:43.02]Hawks hail.
[99:43.58]Thanks for subbing as well.
[99:44.30]Alright, for the purposes of character development... Wait, where is he?
[99:49.86]Where is he?
[99:53.95]Alright, there we go.
[99:55.09]Alright guys, you ready?
[99:57.33]So... I don't wanna... I'm saving these Estuses.
[100:00.77]I did that joke last time.
[100:01.81]We're not doing it again.
[100:05.35]On the count of three... I would like... Who's the new leader?
[100:08.60]We need... Okay.
[100:10.28]Balthier, you are the leader.
[100:11.32]You are gonna lead us to the next checkpoint.
[100:13.52]Lead us to the bridge.
[100:15.70]So, on the count of three... Five... One... Two... Three...
[100:25.25]Stick together.
[100:26.89]Stay together.
[100:27.83]Don't stray.
[100:34.56]Let's go.
[100:35.32]No, wait.
[100:36.24]Okay, let's go.
[100:41.31]To the bridge.
[100:44.09]Don't fight enemies.
[100:44.67]No reason to fight.
[100:46.95]Watch out.
[100:48.43]Get stabbed in the fucking ear.
[100:53.53]No, no, no!
[100:53.99]Move, move, move!
[100:55.31]We gotta keep moving, keep moving, keep moving!
[100:57.13]He's way... He's far behind his friend!
[101:03.39]Stay with us!
[101:03.95]Stay with Balthier!
[101:09.76]Just getting out of the way.
[101:11.82]That guy's gonna triple kill us all.
[101:15.72]Whoa!
[101:16.52]He's behind us!
[101:18.26]To the bridge, to the bridge, bridge, bridge, bridge!
[101:23.28]That's one down.
[101:23.90]This guy's got the dancer blades.
[101:32.18]Fall about here.
[101:33.42]Stay together.
[101:37.95]Where is he?
[101:38.47]Still behind us?
[101:39.27]Yeah, he's still back there.
[101:40.41]He's pretty far away, though.
[101:41.37]I think we're going to be good.
[101:42.61]As long as we get over the bridge and across the bridge.
[101:44.89]To grab at this house we go.
[101:47.77]Over the river and through the woods.
[101:49.02]To grab at this house we go.
[101:50.64]Over the river and through the woods.
[101:51.84]To grab at this house we go.
[101:58.98]Why do I have no socks at all?
[102:00.28]What are you talking about?
[102:00.86]Socks.
[102:02.68]Watch out, he's in front of us.
[102:04.06]He's gonna do the same shit he did last time.
[102:06.84]You know what?
[102:10.59]Just... Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[102:14.29]Get!
[102:14.89]He's gonna do it again.
[102:15.79]He's gonna do it again.
[102:16.45]Just dive around.
[102:18.75]Somebody died.
[102:19.55]Somebody's dead.
[102:20.07]Three people are dead.
[102:23.61]I'm not gonna even turn around.
[102:24.37]I have no idea.
[102:25.63]Everybody died.
[102:28.15]Who's still with me?
[102:28.69]Oh, me and Balthier are still here.
[102:30.61]Everyone's dead.
[102:32.64]Nice.
[102:34.36]We did it.
[102:35.70]We actually did it.
[102:37.60]We made it to the bridge.
[102:39.40]Congratulations, everybody.
[102:42.18]We are the victors.
[102:44.26]And to the victors go the spoils.
[102:45.68]Just a little bit further.
[102:49.86]We have people, right?
[102:51.24]Me and two people.
[102:53.78]No, that's not a good idea.
[102:55.53]Is he going to make it?
[102:59.80]Don't scare me like that, dude.
[103:02.56]We've done it.
[103:03.82]Alright, let's get it.
[103:06.48]We got a phantom.
[103:07.96]Good luck coming over here, dude.
[103:10.64]Have fun trying to get over here.
[103:11.76]Bridge is out.
[103:20.88]We got like three invaders or something.
[103:26.14]And you know what?
[103:27.90]Fucking kill this guy.
[103:32.22]He gives a shit.
[103:35.02]Shut up, idiot.
[103:38.51]Thanks for the 500, Roseberry.
[103:40.63]Ster can't touch Grammy, Jerem Jerem.
[103:45.41]Ah, a bonfire.
[103:46.61]Oh, look, a bonfire.
[103:54.41]Who cares?
[104:00.26]Alright, I let it... That guy died.
[104:01.42]Yeah, this is gonna be good.
[104:08.80]Okay, everybody turn into a chair.
[104:11.22]Hide over here.
[104:17.89]You'll never see this.
[104:18.63]Just be a stool over here.
[104:21.57]Get over here, quick.
[104:25.19]We're so inconspicuous.
[104:31.90]Quick, get over here.
[104:32.34]Get over here, there's a box.
[104:44.23]How do we have four of us in here?
[104:46.97]Can we even get invaded now?
[104:50.11]I think we can.
[104:52.47]Yeah, okay, here comes an invader.
[104:54.36]There he is.
[104:56.80]You think you can fuck with, like, the stool family?
[105:01.42]Alright, one-on-one.
[105:03.34]I command it.
[105:05.56]The stepladder commands a one-on-one fight.
[105:08.08]Quantum pimple versus guts.
[105:11.38]The master commands it.
[105:13.73]Let me through.
[105:14.83]Let me through.
[105:15.29]I must witness my champion.
[105:21.57]I must see his defeat.
[105:26.18]Oh no, one champion has been vanquished.
[105:29.06]You, my son, stepladder two.
[105:32.56]It's your turn.
[105:33.92]Fight him.
[105:36.26]One on one.
[105:37.78]Go get him.
[105:41.39]I will use my stair powers to use me as a camera.
[105:48.89]Come on.
[105:49.69]Come on, Valkyr.
[105:51.63]You were the chosen one.
[105:57.61]This is a good angle.
[105:59.07]Excuse me.
[106:03.25]And then whoever wins gets to sit on me.
[106:09.97]And just like that, the chosen one.
[106:12.45]Oh, he drank an Estes.
[106:14.55]He drank an Estes.
[106:24.39]Get him.
[106:26.36]Oh, no.
[106:31.38]Oh, my son!
[106:35.18]You did it!
[106:36.46]Who is the next challenger?
[106:39.03]I dare they come face me.
[106:45.69]This is stupid looking.
[106:48.43]Hold on.
[106:49.57]There's a guy sitting on the edge over here.
[106:53.99]Do you see him?
[106:57.05]I swear to God, that wasn't on purpose.
[107:04.91]He got in the way of the camera.
[107:08.15]He got in the way of the camera.
[107:09.54]That was not on purpose.
[107:10.74]I fucking swear to God.
[107:16.36]I promise that was not on purpose.
[107:20.74]I wanted to get a good look and he obscured my view in the camera.
[107:28.19]Alright, how about Sneaky Fuckface?
[107:36.23]This is why Dark Souls is fun, man.
[107:38.61]This is a fun game.
[107:39.57]Alright, on to the next area.
[107:47.47]Alright, Sly.
[107:48.19]Let's see if we can get another guy in.
[107:58.66]Is that guy... I don't know.
[108:06.23]You think I have an answer?
[108:06.99]I don't.
[108:09.69]Wasn't Trevor saying game sucks earlier?
[108:12.09]Yeah, it was a funny joke.
[108:14.49]Dude, I appreciate all the people giving me these embers because this is going to end real quick if I don't get them.
[108:19.78]But I appreciate it.
[108:21.12]You don't have to do it, but thank you nonetheless.
[108:26.62]Alright, last one.
[108:28.44]Let's make our way to the next area.
[108:31.50]Which is... Out and around, right?
[108:34.24]Alright, I want to be a different character now.
[108:36.99]I want to be a guy with a funny hat.
[108:53.64]A guy with a funny hat and...
[108:58.86]I don't even know.
[108:59.42]I'm going to put the whip on too.
[109:02.88]I want to use the whip.
[109:08.22]It's in the wrong hand.
[109:14.83]Alright.
[109:16.09]Is somebody blocking the door?
[109:21.57]Alright, we're going to go this way, right?
[109:22.61]No, we're going to go down.
[109:25.45]Okay, we're going to go down.
[109:27.83]Follow me.
[109:31.21]I'm gonna go down the... Watch out for that idiot.
[109:35.09]Watch out for that idiot!
[109:37.65]Alright, be careful here.
[109:42.63]Can I not hit this with my f***ing stupid... Easy!
[109:46.68]Easy, dude!
[109:47.24]Come on!
[109:47.74]Easy!
[109:52.60]He's dead.
[109:53.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[109:54.56]Hold on, here comes the... That guy was so greedy for the kill that he killed himself.
[110:04.60]Oh my god, we haven't even gotten down the stairs.
[110:09.25]Alright, let's go, quick.
[110:11.03]Make your way down the stairs.
[110:11.93]Easy, easy, easy.
[110:16.77]Keep it up, keep it up.
[110:18.25]Don't let him down.
[110:19.35]Alright, I'm gonna make it.
[110:23.66]Wait, what?
[110:39.51]He's dead.
[110:41.35]Yeah, fine.
[110:46.53]Some of this guy.
[110:47.55]Some of this guy.
[110:48.53]When he spawns, just fucking don't even let him do a move.
[110:51.63]Beat the absolute bag out of this guy.
[110:55.04]Right when he appears.
[110:56.82]No mercy.
[111:00.48]Absolute zero mercy for this guy.
[111:02.80]There he is.
[111:03.10]Get him.
[111:08.20]Kick him off.
[111:08.98]Kick him off the edge.
[111:13.80]Kick him.
[111:15.32]Oh, he's running away.
[111:16.02]No, you didn't even make it.
[111:17.56]You just didn't even make it, man.
[111:18.72]Alright, fuck it.
[111:19.92]Let's just go.
[111:20.88]You guys know the drill.
[111:23.28]Be careful here.
[111:23.94]This is dangerous.
[111:27.25]Jesus!
[111:29.27]There's too many people here.
[111:31.77]Stupid.
[111:34.53]I think somebody died.
[111:38.09]Be careful.
[111:39.47]Hold on.
[111:39.99]Easy, easy.
[111:40.51]There's some people throwing those spears.
[111:41.95]Somebody didn't make the jump.
[111:50.70]Oh my goodness.
[111:55.26]I've missed every single fucking item.
[112:00.08]That one doesn't explode, doesn't explode.
[112:06.08]I have a lot of souls right now.
[112:09.66]Hey, cool, an ember.
[112:10.94]I need those.
[112:13.71]Invaded by dark spirit.
[112:14.73]Hold tight right here.
[112:17.93]This is so awkward for him to get here.
[112:20.39]There's a guy right there.
[112:27.43]Way to go.
[112:31.41]Is he right under me?
[112:34.49]Nope.
[112:34.73]I think he is.
[112:37.28]He is!
[112:37.72]He's fucking flamethrowing.
[112:45.82]What?
[112:46.12]You guys left me in the dust.
[112:53.93]Fuck.
[112:54.47]It was right there.
[113:00.40]That guy was breathing fire underneath my feet.
[113:02.52]He was just burning the shi- I was like, ow ow ow, like it was hot sand.
[113:10.22]Dude, I love getting like six people on those dumb branches.
[113:13.32]At least three people fall off every fucking time.
[113:16.34]It's hilarious.
[113:22.58]God, what a fucking- I love this game.
[113:25.58]What a stupid- Look at this guy's face.
[113:32.64]This person looks like somebody pushed their thumb into somebody's face and made it a play-doh.
[113:44.05]Take off the sorcery rings.
[113:46.07]No, who cares.
[113:49.91]We're going with the sickle.
[113:50.79]We're going with the mad sickle.
[113:59.12]AC-130 inbound.
[114:01.16]Oh, this guy's a mad spirit.
[114:02.26]This is going to end well.
[114:05.66]This guy's already here.
[114:08.56]No fighting.
[114:09.58]No fighting inside the safe zone.
[114:11.04]This is a sanctuary.
[114:13.22]Nope.
[114:14.91]I missed him.
[114:15.55]He can stay alive.
[114:17.99]Alright.
[114:18.57]Now we're out of the safe zone.
[114:19.77]We can now fight.
[114:22.41]Fight on the bridge.
[114:23.89]No.
[114:24.17]No.
[114:24.23]No.
[114:24.35]No.
[114:24.85]No.
[114:25.35]No.
[114:25.81]No.
[114:30.31]No!
[114:32.45]Just get down it.
[114:36.97]Can I please get down the fucking... Descend!
[114:40.20]Alright, let's go.
[114:43.22]We were just stuck in each other.
[114:48.17]Neither one of us could move.
[115:02.79]I fucking knew it.
[115:03.69]I like knew it.
[115:05.89]I knew it.
[115:07.29]I was gonna wait because I knew that was gonna fucking happen.
[115:11.45]Nobody can handle the bridge.
[115:13.21]Nobody can take it.
[115:13.99]Everybody just acts like a psycho.
[115:17.37]Let's get some more dark phantoms in here.
[115:32.24]Is that it?
[115:33.90]I can't summon any more people?
[115:39.64]Alright.
[115:41.02]We should be good to go now.
[115:42.00]I think I can summon one more person.
[115:44.40]Let's get this guy.
[115:48.38]Good luck.
[115:50.38]Let's make our way down.
[115:52.94]Somebody else go first.
[115:55.37]I'm not dealing with this.
[116:00.05]I love how your costume changes every time you die.
[116:02.03]Yeah, we're playing costume.
[116:03.53]Fashion souls.
[116:05.63]Alright.
[116:06.47]You guys can... I'm not going down there first.
[116:09.19]If I die, the game ends.
[116:11.09]If one of you guys die, you can be replaced.
[116:13.79]That was terrible.
[116:18.37]But you know what I mean.
[116:25.67]I fucking fell off.
[116:26.31]No, I didn't.
[116:26.61]Thank God.
[116:32.13]Alright, hold up, hold up.
[116:33.61]Anybody behind us?
[116:34.29]I don't think so.
[116:36.17]Anybody in front of us down here?
[116:40.31]Don't think so.
[116:41.07]I think we're good.
[116:45.13]That was a risky move.
[116:47.01]Should I do that too?
[116:48.05]Oh, no.
[116:53.18]Oh my fucking god!
[116:55.98]Oh my god!
[116:59.44]I'm freaking out!
[117:03.41]Slow down.
[117:04.75]Slow down.
[117:07.11]Jesus!
[117:11.25]Just calm down.
[117:15.21]Alright, we're good.
[117:15.69]We're good.
[117:15.93]I'm good.
[117:16.13]I'm good.
[117:16.39]Bonfire's right here.
[117:21.53]Wow.
[117:24.60]Oh!
[117:27.80]They just did a... They just did a... They power range landed.
[117:31.18]Fucking power rangers.
[117:35.17]You fucking... You goddamn... I have to kill them to touch the bonfire, don't I?
[117:47.56]Nice, he hit his own guy.
[117:48.32]Hit his own guy!
[117:54.74]Come help me.
[117:55.22]You gotta kill these guys.
[117:55.96]Get up and kill.
[117:59.08]And there's another fucking guy here?
[118:00.38]There's two?
[118:00.90]There's three?
[118:04.44]What are they for?
[118:05.34]And here comes a couple of crabs!
[118:08.00]Let's make it interesting!
[118:10.54]Let's make it fucking interesting!
[118:16.54]Get them crabs!
[118:18.54]No, don't get me!
[118:21.22]Accidentally swing and hit one of these guys right in the fucking head.
[118:28.99]Oh my god, this is so unfair.
[118:31.43]This is the most unfair fucking shit ever.
[118:36.57]Wait a minute.
[118:36.97]Come on, I need more friends.
[118:44.10]How am I fucking still alive?
[118:45.96]This is just crap.
[118:54.73]Oh my fucking god.
[118:57.85]Oh my god.
[118:59.61]It's not stopping.
[119:01.01]Crabs are fucking killing everybody.
[119:03.23]I can't even fucking think.
[119:09.21]Who's on my team?
[119:09.97]I don't even know.
[119:28.00]How did I stay alive for that long?
[119:29.78]I don't know.
[119:33.32]All the crabs are just coming for me and I'm not even wearing fucking... The joke that I don't wear clothes is done.
[119:39.94]Put on real fucking armor and, like, take a weapon out for crying out loud.
[119:46.54]It's just, like, such an easy kill.
[119:48.68]Put on the fat lady costume.
[119:49.86]Put on the... What's his name from... I made this joke six months ago, but I'm gonna do it again.
[119:54.64]Oogie Boogie from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
[120:00.01]Put on an actual weapon.
[120:01.11]I don't even care what it is, as long as I can use it.
[120:09.42]God, my stomach is killing me.
[120:12.62]Alright, we're gonna do Sorcerer's Staff in the left hand.
[120:18.02]Moonlit Blade in the other.
[120:18.98]We're going like actual character.
[120:26.09]Where's my... Oh man, that was fucking funny.
[120:31.51]I can't believe I stayed alive as long as I did.
[120:33.83]That was remarkable to me.
[120:34.73]Alright, let's do it again.
[120:43.81]I earned this for the pro ladder strats.
[120:46.35]Oh, thank you, Rolando.
[120:48.99]Flawless victory.
[120:49.53]Thanks, Roseberry, for the 200.
[120:50.37]Oh, and then X10 at X. Thanks for three months.
[120:55.81]My man, Jeremy, you got to look at what I tweeted to you a few hours ago.
[120:59.34]I'll check it out when the stream is done.
[121:05.14]So how fun and fair was that?
[121:08.18]That was... three enemy phantoms and two giant crabs versus me.
[121:13.89]I summoned some random guy and he just popped up and got killed instantly.
[121:26.40]Somebody came in and said, is he still on the same fucking boss?
[121:34.36]No, this is not... I haven't properly played Dark Souls in probably like two hours.
[121:43.15]I'm fat rolling now.
[121:45.45]Whatever, who cares?
[121:46.17]Do we got three?
[121:53.29]That's a cool weapon.
[121:55.13]Oh, wait a minute.
[121:56.29]That's the last DLC boss's weapon, isn't it?
[122:02.59]One, two.
[122:02.83]We're waiting for the third one.
[122:04.97]Here comes the third one.
[122:10.76]Alright, now I have an actual bunch of compatriots now.
[122:19.24]I think this is the proper way to play Dark Souls.
[122:20.94]It probably is.
[122:23.00]Alright.
[122:24.44]This time, I want to do something different.
[122:27.38]Don't break the bridge.
[122:31.65]Do not break the bridge.
[122:33.79]If you are an invader, don't break the bridge.
[122:38.05]Get on the bridge.
[122:39.21]No, I just said, I just said, don't break the bridge.
[122:42.06]Oh, god damn it.
[122:43.68]No, this shit's gonna happen again.
[122:51.56]Son of a gun.
[122:54.72]Aww.
[122:58.58]Well, let's keep going.
[123:03.78]They're gonna... Don't break the bridge.
[123:04.82]They're gonna break the bridge.
[123:08.50]It's a mess.
[123:09.32]Let me tell you something.
[123:11.52]This is just a mess.
[123:12.80]Okay, let's bring them all in.
[123:14.71]I don't even care.
[123:21.37]Summoning Dark Spirit.
[123:23.59]Who's fighting?
[123:25.89]Alright, let's do it again.
[123:32.00]I ain't going down there with him.
[123:32.96]Are you kidding me?
[123:37.59]Where's the third guy?
[123:39.61]Is he already down there?
[123:41.05]Yeah, he's already down there.
[123:46.09]Holy shit!
[123:55.82]Wow!
[123:57.64]Wow!
[124:00.36]Wow!
[124:02.80]Unbelievable that I didn't die.
[124:09.93]Keep on moving.
[124:13.01]Triple team this guy.
[124:18.33]Watch out.
[124:19.76]There he is.
[124:20.48]The Michelin man himself is up there.
[124:24.66]This fat roll sucks.
[124:25.62]Just waiting for someone to throw a grenade at us.
[124:34.52]Are they fighting him up there?
[124:37.78]It's a brawl up there between these three.
[124:45.34]I wish I could shoot him right now.
[124:46.90]If I had a bow and arrow, that would have been hilarious.
[124:49.98]He's coming back.
[124:54.16]Oh, he didn't make it.
[124:55.27]He didn't make it.
[124:55.85]He, in fact, he, in fact, missed it by a little bit.
[124:59.23]By quite a little small stretch.
[125:04.19]Somebody just hit me.
[125:05.73]I don't know who it was.
[125:06.27]It was that guy.
[125:07.53]There's a guy breathing fire behind me, too.
[125:10.47]Where did these guys even come from?
[125:11.60]Does anybody even know?
[125:14.19]They just like, seriously.
[125:16.73]And I lost my bodyguard.
[125:18.07]It's okay.
[125:25.69]Bonfire.
[125:27.65]Bye.
[125:29.63]We made it.
[125:31.31]We made it to the fire.
[125:32.63]Congratulations, I win.
[125:38.48]Light the bonfire.
[125:42.05]He missed it by a taint's sniff.
[125:45.67]Congratulations.
[125:46.91]You... Wait a minute.
[125:50.98]What is that?
[125:51.30]Some kind of FailFish?
[125:54.86]What is that?
[125:55.16]Some kind of fucking FailFish?
[125:57.92]Don't you know that people get banned in my chat for that shit?

[130:49.66]What happened there?
[130:54.46]That was fucking crazy.
[131:05.97]And he's gonna do his move in a second.
[131:14.85]Actually, this isn't too bad considering he has to focus like one person.
[131:24.78]He's focusing me.
[131:25.68]Fuck, thought I dodged it.
[131:33.33]He's in psycho mode We're gonna go for a kill shot here Everything you got attack him kill him

[132:03.02]Nice one.
[132:06.96]Wow, that's so much easier with four people.
[132:09.94]How many attempts did that take me to do on my own?
[132:13.14]I was here last time.
[132:17.50]I think a lot.
[132:21.69]Stop sending your twinkle balls at them.

[132:32.40]I don't think there's anything here.
[132:33.26]17?
[132:36.78]I don't think it was that many.
[132:43.16]I don't think it was that many, guys.
[132:46.48]Less than 10, more than 5.
[132:47.60]That sounds about right.
[132:53.15]Alright, there's nothing here.
[132:54.13]Let's just light that bonfire.
[133:00.79]Let's go level up.

[134:57.36]Yeah, I should make a YouTube channel.
[135:00.36]You're right.
[135:08.43]Oh, no, no, no.
[135:08.89]Yeah, chapel.
[135:13.36]We're gonna do a bridge fight.
[135:15.08]How the bridge fight works is only... And I mean only.
[135:19.74]I don't want to see anybody fucking around here.
[135:21.70]Don't screw this up.
[135:23.72]Only fists.
[135:25.56]Fist fighting.
[135:26.98]Unarmed.
[135:27.84]On the bridge.
[135:29.16]Four o'clock.
[135:30.28]Let's do it.
[135:34.21]No, I already have one.
[135:34.95]Okay.
[135:36.59]And you gotta be naked, too.
[135:38.61]If I see anybody with fucking clothes on, you're out.
[135:44.71]Hey, thank you, SBO.
[135:47.57]SBO.
[135:49.18]Thanks for BAing you.
[136:02.14]And then Munchy knows.
[136:02.90]Welcome, dude.
[136:04.66]Already a guy here.
[136:05.84]Already.
[136:06.18]Does this guy not hear the rules?
[136:09.16]Did you not listen to the rules?
[136:11.36]What are you doing?
[136:14.62]Do I have to sick my fucking minions on you?
[136:18.95]Alright, somebody kill this guy.
[136:24.47]He's gonna kill all three of us.
[136:27.29]We're like Curly, Larry, and Moe right now.
[136:42.75]We actually might be able to beat him.
[136:45.29]Alright, get him.
[136:46.67]Oh, I just walked right into a baseball swing.
[136:48.77]That was dumb.
[136:53.10]Alright, that guy didn't want to play by the rules.
[136:55.36]Okay.
[136:57.96]Well, he's dead.
[137:01.30]Alright.
[137:03.34]Remember.
[137:04.86]I'm going to summon a Dark Phantom.
[137:08.28]This guy's legit.
[137:09.92]This guy will play by the rules.
[137:11.26]I'm certain of it.
[137:13.04]Who else is going to play by the rules?
[137:14.08]He'll play by the rules, too.
[137:17.96]We need at least five people there.
[137:21.26]Pepe will play by the rules, too, I would assume.
[137:23.98]Whoever gets in here first.
[137:31.95]Why are you guys so handsome?
[137:37.55]Should we all just be dragons?
[137:38.67]Oh, that's a good idea.
[137:39.29]I want to be a dragon too.
[137:40.01]Alright, if you have the dragon outfit, put it on.
[137:52.42]And to the bridge, do not attack the bridge.
[137:55.18]If you got the dragon outfit, put it on, so then we can't even determine who the fuck is on our team and not... Is it...
[138:02.51]Okay, the way that that just looked, I thought that was a dragon coming out of the door.
[138:06.31]That scared the shit out of me.
[138:09.67]Alright, no dragon moves.
[138:12.98]Do we just have one dark spirit right now?
[138:15.84]Or is there two?
[138:18.86]Bridge fight.
[138:20.64]Get in the middle of the bridge.
[138:23.42]Excuse me.
[138:24.42]Excuse me.
[138:26.87]Get on this bridge.
[138:27.91]I ain't getting on this bridge.
[138:28.79]No, no, no.
[138:29.65]Get on the bridge.
[138:31.70]I'm not getting on that bridge until you're all on the bridge.
[138:34.42]I know the fucking swindling you guys will do when I get on there.
[138:38.56]Get on that bridge.
[138:45.49]I'm just gonna wait.
[138:46.61]Center of the bridge, right in the middle.
[138:48.89]I ain't starting until I see everyone in the middle.
[138:55.87]Alright, hold on.
[138:58.79]So right there's going on the count of three.
[139:00.63]I'm going to wait for the stream delay.
[139:04.71]We're going to do a fucking bridge brawl.
[139:09.54]You ready?
[139:09.90]I didn't even count.
[139:18.28]Oh, come on.
[139:20.02]Why?
[139:20.58]No.
[139:21.64]Oh, wow.
[139:27.71]Wow.
[139:29.27]Unbelievable.
[139:31.19]You know what?
[139:31.57]Fuck this.
[139:32.57]I'm ruining the party.
[139:42.64]I got swindled.
[139:43.36]Who was it?
[139:44.42]Who was it?
[139:44.76]They're not getting invited again.
[139:45.71]That motherfucker's not getting another invite.
[139:51.33]Run the tape back.
[139:52.09]Who was that?
[139:55.10]I will pass over their fucking summoning sign every time.
[140:12.69]It was the red guy.
[140:21.34]I wanna have a fight on the bridge.
[140:26.81]Password is slurp.
[140:36.67]S-L-U-R-P.
[140:39.11]I didn't do it.
[140:41.63]By the way, you can't leave the bridge.
[140:44.11]Leaving the bridge is disqualification.
[140:46.45]Hey, surprise butt.
[140:55.39]S-E-C-T-S.
[140:56.73]Thanks for the two months.
[140:59.29]And also thank you to Yol Defermer.
[141:01.31]Yol Defermer.
[141:04.17]And Yol Defeemer.
[141:06.20]Thanks for your subscription.
[141:06.88]And then Munchy Knows.
[141:07.64]Thanks for seven Munchy Knows.
[141:10.76]Did I say fearless?
[141:11.36]Did I say how to fearless nation?
[141:12.38]I think I did.
[141:16.74]Thank you for your five dollars.
[141:23.69]Just trying to get people in here and keeps fucking up.
[141:28.65]Do you make a slurping sound for us?
[141:29.84]Yeah, absolutely.
[141:30.70]That's a great request.
[141:31.70]I will adhere to that request, absolutely.
[141:33.70]Alright, that sounded like I was spitting water into a tube.
[141:39.16]I tried.
[141:48.85]We have one, two, three.
[141:51.33]Yeah.
[142:01.13]Let's get another, uh... Let's get a mad phantom in here.
[142:05.11]Oh shit, no, that's the guy.
[142:06.41]Fuck!
[142:07.58]I think that's the guy that just did it.
[142:09.36]Kill him.
[142:09.84]Kill this guy immediately when he shows up.
[142:11.44]I think this is the guy that fucking knocked the bridge down on purpose.
[142:18.00]When he gets summoned, this mad phantom.
[142:20.26]Fucking kill him.
[142:25.89]One, two, three, four.
[142:27.75]Where is he?
[142:31.36]Alright, kill this guy immediately.
[142:34.54]Co-op the fuck out of this guy.
[142:35.77]That's the guy that knocked the bridge down.
[142:37.47]Get him!
[142:39.17]Get him!
[142:44.19]Get this guy.
[142:54.68]I love this guy.
[142:55.52]This is so stupid.
[143:00.59]No, hold on a second.
[143:01.75]We're trying to get rid of a bad guy here.
[143:03.67]Just take out a fucking sword.
[143:05.67]Take out a sword and slash him.
[143:09.37]No reason to hold back.
[143:10.43]Kill him.
[143:15.11]Oh my god.
[143:15.85]He's trying to climb the ladder.
[143:18.93]Are you serious?
[143:21.73]Get him.
[143:23.55]I order you to get him.
[143:30.11]Oh my god, I'm going to accidentally kill people.
[143:34.73]He's making us kill each other.
[143:40.22]Here he goes.
[143:40.80]Oh, shit.
[143:47.86]One more hit.
[143:51.25]This guy is like a whole family chasing a mouse.
[143:53.93]Alright, he's dead.
[143:56.95]Got him.
[144:03.44]Well, I love the chat.
[144:04.36]Watch that not even be the right guy.
[144:06.16]I would feel real bad then.
[144:10.50]Hey, Pepe, if that wasn't you that last time, then I'm real damn sorry.
[144:16.91]One, two, three, four, five, this'll be six.
[144:23.41]And again, no weapons, no running.
[144:26.63]I don't care what happens to the bridge.
[144:28.41]No running.
[144:28.77]Make sure you're at full health.
[144:34.82]We're still waiting for one person.
[144:35.84]Alright, one, two, three, four, five.
[144:39.38]Alright, here we go.
[144:40.68]Get on the bridge.
[144:42.80]What are you using, man?
[144:44.51]Don't not break this bridge.
[144:49.35]Whatever you do, get in the middle.
[144:56.31]It wasn't him?
[144:58.22]Oh, shit.
[144:59.62]Well, that sucks.
[145:01.36]In the middle.
[145:02.38]In the middle.
[145:05.79]That's a good idea.
[145:07.69]You can, like, sneak up on him.
[145:13.04]Right in the middle.
[145:14.68]Alright, another count of three.
[145:17.46]Oh, this is so obnoxious.
[145:19.20]Everyone's just a fucking tree lady.
[145:20.64]No, this is dumb.
[145:21.92]Alright, you ready?
[145:23.30]Three.
[145:23.94]Get in the middle of the bridge.
[145:25.18]Middle of the bridge.
[145:25.76]No running.
[145:26.24]You can't run away.
[145:26.96]If you run away, you're disqualified.
[145:31.02]One, two, three.
[145:33.88]No running away, even if the fucking bridge falls.
[145:35.76]Go.
[145:35.94]I'm waiting for the stream delay.
[145:45.79]It's gonna be funny.
[145:46.71]All of a sudden, it's gonna be like, ah!
[145:47.81]Here we go!
[146:05.67]We didn't die!
[146:07.41]We're still alive!
[146:11.43]What a magical... Who did that to me?
[146:27.38]Okay, yeah.
[146:28.40]I was expecting the bridge to fall.
[146:30.22]I also was expecting five people to instantly die, which didn't happen.
[146:46.49]Alright, now... What time is it?
[146:51.51]My phone is dead.
[146:52.33]That's great.
[146:55.51]You glorious bastards.
[146:56.73]Well, thank you, Roseberry.
[146:59.89]For the 300.
[147:02.39]Final destination, Fox only.
[147:08.45]Alright.
[147:10.67]I would like to... How long has this stream been going on for?
[147:17.48]The whole stream.
[147:19.46]Even though we're not technically counting the shitty casino game.
[147:23.34]It's at 9.
[147:23.70]It's like 10 o'clock Eastern.
[147:28.83]I'm gonna... We'll do some co-op through the next area for a little bit.
[147:35.43]That was fun though.
[147:36.09]Thank you everybody that participated in that shit.
[147:45.23]I'm gonna go to the other bonfire.
[147:52.63]And make our way through to the next boss.
[147:57.61]I'm not allowed to stop the stream.
[148:01.55]Did I miss blind, unlined?
[148:03.29]I think I did.
[148:04.17]How did I miss these four people?
[148:05.45]Wow, I'm an idiot.
[148:07.91]Norster, thanks for three months.
[148:09.40]Blind, unlined, thanks for your subscription.
[148:10.98]SuperEyes, I got that guy.
[148:14.34]Twitch alerts just popped up with names that I didn't see.
[148:17.40]Okay.
[148:19.27]Alright.
[148:20.63]Let's actually play the game of Dark Souls.
[148:27.35]Wait, you can't... You actually do... Ah, that's right.
[148:30.57]That is right.
[148:31.20]That is right.
[148:33.98]I actually do have to, like, climb down and around.
[148:42.14]Got a new chair.
[148:43.32]Hope it's good.
[148:57.23]I just, like, made everybody put this sign down over there, too.
[149:00.93]Actually playing the game, ResidentSleeper?
[149:03.40]No, he's gonna play the game now.
[149:05.08]I mean, you had to figure at some point, of, like, three hours of bullshit, I had to play the game, right?
[149:22.40]Let's get my shit back on.
[149:31.49]Fashion souls, who cares?
[149:33.01]As long as I don't fat roll.
[149:41.31]Alright, let's get some people in here.
[149:44.07]Oh, some people we haven't seen.
[149:46.01]I've seen most of these people, I think, already.
[149:50.12]That actually looks like Ted Cruz.
[149:52.48]Good job.
[149:53.46]That's a really good job.
[149:58.70]Hmm.
[150:00.28]I remember this guy.
[150:01.06]This guy attacked me before.
[150:10.47]Three hours of shit.
[150:13.37]And then playing the game.
[150:16.09]Password is Slurp.
[150:19.28]S-L-U-R-P.
[150:24.74]This guy's name is Mistakes.
[150:25.92]Sure, why not?
[150:27.72]Looks like an old revolutionary clown.
[150:39.72]Let's go actually play the video game Dark Souls 3.
[150:43.32]No more fucking around.
[150:44.20]Don't do any dumb shit.
[150:46.84]We already got an invader.
[150:47.76]It's okay.
[150:48.26]We're gonna instantly kill him.
[150:49.42]No fucking around.
[150:54.02]There he is already.
[150:54.58]They see he's already... Maybe he's being... Maybe he's not trying to attack.
[150:59.59]That's okay.
[151:04.21]So we have to go across, right?
[151:05.65]And then down and around.
[151:07.93]Right?
[151:08.07]Okay.
[151:11.68]Can't wait for somebody to smash this.
[151:13.62]That sure would be funny.
[151:15.32]Nobody even did it.
[151:16.02]Are we even gonna make it?
[151:17.90]Am I gonna make it?
[151:18.58]Alright, where's the ladder?
[151:24.98]There's too many people here.
[151:33.65]Way too many people.
[151:37.83]Wait, I gotta get the bug.
[151:44.40]Another dark spirit.
[151:46.20]Bring him on.
[151:48.66]Not scared.
[151:49.32]That was very loud, whatever it was.
[152:00.13]Let's get down to bird town.
[152:06.31]This is going to look so... Oh, look at how cool this looks.
[152:13.03]We're all skiing into action.
[152:14.19]I think the Dark Spirit died somehow.
[152:24.48]Can't even move.
[152:33.98]Loud.
[152:41.87]I'm not even getting any of the items.
[152:43.27]This is ridiculous.
[152:44.14]Ah, it's too loud in my ears.
[152:48.24]Shut it up.
[152:48.68]Thought it was a sorcery stream.
[153:00.95]Well, it does say sorcerer.
[153:02.69]I think I spelt that wrong, too.
[153:04.63]Isn't it?
[153:05.79]Sorceror?
[153:06.29]Or is it sorcerer?
[153:07.29]I added an extra ER.
[153:09.82]Ah, fuck it.
[153:10.32]Who cares?
[153:14.13]I don't think I ever got that item.
[153:15.63]Ever.
[153:21.06]Uh-oh, watch out.
[153:23.02]Nice try.
[153:24.70]You almost had us.
[153:26.44]You almost got us.
[153:27.62]This is going to turn into a fucking mess.
[153:32.51]We probably should help this guy.
[153:40.98]It's hard to even tell what's going on.
[153:42.26]There's so many people in here.
[153:45.97]This is stupid.
[153:48.93]Nothing about this should be allowed.
[153:51.53]But it being allowed is the best thing ever.
[154:00.89]Get up.
[154:01.29]We can't not move?
[154:13.99]Come on, come on up.
[154:17.35]Come on up.
[154:22.35]Hey, AtherinGaming, thanks him.
[154:27.74]Thanks him.
[154:30.62]Oh, look, there's a bird here.
[154:31.64]Okay, bye.
[154:49.36]Mmm, we go this way, right?
[154:50.24]Yeah.
[154:51.92]Bonfire.
[154:53.24]I can't light it.
[154:54.68]I can't light it because, unfortunately, you have to die.
[155:00.65]This guy's gotta die.
[155:02.17]Sorry.
[155:03.21]I can't touch the bonfire if you're still here alive.
[155:05.39]It's been lit.
[155:13.07]There it is.
[155:17.58]Another guy.
[155:18.38]It's so funny how there's just random fucking people that are just always invading.
[155:23.96]Welcome to Dark Souls, huh?
[155:31.43]Let's get right to the boss.
[155:33.75]Don't waste any time.
[155:34.61]Just speedrun this whole thing.
[155:43.14]This is so much harder doing this by yourself.
[155:46.64]This is like hilariously easy doing this in the open world.
[155:48.88]We're gonna go in one of these buildings, don't we?
[156:02.00]Get him!
[156:04.66]Oh, fine, let him run.
[156:06.48]Let him run.
[156:07.04]Did we lose a fa- Wow, what the fuck was I- What am I thinking here?
[156:17.17]What the fuck am I doing?
[156:21.37]He died.
[156:21.69]The guy's dead.
[156:22.77]There's another phantom behind me.
[156:24.93]There's another phantom.
[156:26.13]Okay.
[156:27.45]I guess there's another guy.
[156:29.59]He's going to pop up.
[156:30.23]Watch out.
[156:30.59]He's going to jump scare you.
[156:35.21]Told you.
[156:40.99]God, this is fucking moronic.
[156:47.04]Does anybody know what is going on?
[156:50.16]I can't tell you what's happening.
[156:54.14]Get out of here.
[156:56.40]He's waiting for me, isn't he?
[157:00.15]Shit, somebody fell off.
[157:09.51]Get out of here.
[157:12.28]Oh, now I'm toxic.
[157:13.26]Fantastic.
[157:16.46]I need to eat that, like, moonlit clump, whatever the hell it's called.
[157:19.08]Hey, look, I made it in the house.
[157:24.28]Thank God I have at least one bodyguard that's still with me, living.
[157:47.30]That fight was toxic long before now.
[157:53.63]Yeah, here we go.
[157:54.69]Here's the roof.
[157:56.97]This is a never-ending stream of people invading the game.
[158:05.04]This really is just open-world PvP.
[158:15.39]Thank God Ted Cruz is still with me.
[158:17.03]Ted Cruz is still with me.
[158:20.09]Gonna have a flat tax.
[158:21.81]That government's not gonna be involved in anything, I promise you that.
[158:29.37]There's another guy.
[158:31.82]Don't you guys feel like this is BioShock Infinite?
[158:36.82]What the fuck was that?
[158:39.90]That wasn't correct.
[158:42.42]That wasn't corrected.
[158:43.16]That's not fucking fair.
[158:44.48]That's not fair.
[158:45.32]I was marveling at the fucking floating guy.
[158:48.14]I can't even play this game normally.
[159:04.59]Hey, you guys want to go box on the fucking bridge again?
[159:07.17]Wasn't that a whole lot of fun?
[159:09.05]Hey.
[159:11.75]You guys remember when we did that thing on the bridge?
[159:13.37]Let's do it again!
[159:16.27]I'm not even fucking taking a guy.
[159:17.86]No, people can still invade.
[159:18.92]People can still invade me.
[159:23.14]I need bodyguards.
[159:32.78]Don't try and knuckle.
[159:33.66]No, it's no fun like that.
[159:34.62]I like the danger.
[159:37.20]But I have to have bodyguards that are prepared.
[159:40.66]Who's the most prepared of all these bodyguards?
[159:42.52]I don't know.
[159:42.98]How long is he even stuck on this part of the game?
[159:52.39]See, this is what I was talking about.
[159:53.75]Okay, let's break this down.
[159:55.51]Remember like two hours ago when I said people were just going to find this stream because it says Dark Souls 3?
[159:59.43]And they're going to be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[160:04.93]Why does this guy need three people to help him beat this?
[160:08.20]Now I get it.
[160:09.88]I should put it in the title.
[160:11.52]Like, goofing and spoofing.
[160:15.76]But I'm not gonna.
[160:17.00]Because who cares?
[160:19.26]Password is Slurp.
[160:21.59]S-L-U-R-P.
[160:27.55]I need Ted Cruz.
[160:29.63]Yeah, he was a good... He was a good protector.
[160:36.28]Already a guy here.
[160:39.76]Here comes the fake star.
[160:43.84]I'm gonna check this out, guys.
[160:46.49]Watch this one.
[160:47.65]Well, I'm gonna hide.
[160:48.33]I'm gonna hide behind the corner, or I'm gonna get you when you come out the door.
[160:51.91]Ooh!
[161:01.08]Come on, Cruz!
[161:01.98]Come on, Senator Cruz!
[161:04.38]What you're gonna do, Donald, is you're not gonna start to... Come on, Donald!
[161:10.61]Look, I'll just pantomime at him.
[161:17.13]Check out this one.
[161:18.29]Believe me.
[161:21.03]Oh, believe me.
[161:25.72]Oh, believe me.
[161:27.64]Combo.
[161:32.26]Come on, Donald.
[161:35.75]Now, I'll tell you something about Donald's tax plan.
[161:38.31]It ain't gonna work.
[161:39.95]There's no way that Donald Trump's tax plan will have any... Excuse me.
[161:43.32]Excuse me.
[161:44.04]Donald Trump's tax plan will work.
[161:45.98]Believe me.
[161:47.76]This has been your fucking nightly impressions.
[161:50.50]Hope you enjoyed it.
[161:51.04]Remember when I did this one time?
[161:52.56]I'm doing it again.
[161:53.14]No, you don't want to go that way.
[162:11.14]Talk like Truke.
[162:13.46]I can't even talk.
[162:14.68]Talk like Cruz and Trump for the rest of the stream.
[162:16.51]I can't.
[162:18.77]I'm telling you.
[162:20.49]This guy... No, believe me.
[162:24.84]This guy's going to bring all of our jobs to China, okay?
[162:28.74]Trust me.
[162:29.76]I have the best words.
[162:30.92]I have such good words.
[162:32.26]47 embers.
[162:33.16]A little too much on the ember.
[162:35.06]China.
[162:35.80]Get him.
[162:43.01]Go get him, God damn it, Donald.
[162:44.25]Get him.
[162:45.37]Get him, Senator Cruz.
[162:46.15]Get him.
[163:01.64]I'm stuck.
[163:02.46]No, it was... Come on!
[163:08.75]What is happening?
[163:13.13]How did he do that so easily?
[163:14.79]What the fuck?
[163:19.86]God.
[163:20.32]You wanna play Dark Souls?
[163:24.56]I love Dark Souls.
[163:27.11]Excuse me, Donald.
[163:28.08]You wanna play Dark Souls?
[163:29.42]Or should I talk about my flat tax?
[163:30.78]I'm done.
[163:35.02]I'm fucking done.
[163:44.77]It's all about the delegates, Donald.
[163:48.73]I'm certain we'll have at least 200 delegates in my community.
[163:54.13]Fucking goddammit.
[163:59.91]88 embers.
[164:01.59]I have 88 embers.
[164:04.77]You know what's fucking hilarious?
[164:06.31]I'm gonna go sell like 80 of these.
[164:17.22]Let's get more Donalds in here.
[164:21.04]Do I prefer the Steam controller or the Xbox One controller?
[164:24.12]I prefer every controller over the Steam controller.
[164:28.53]I prefer a Nintendo 64 controller.
[164:30.31]I prefer GameCube.
[164:32.03]I prefer the Dreamcast controller over the Steam controller.
[164:35.81]It sucks total asshole.
[164:44.62]Huge.
[164:45.08]It's gonna be huge.
[164:49.06]Huge numbers.
[164:49.90]Big numbers.
[164:50.61]Huge numbers.
[164:51.35]Hillary doesn't have the numbers that I have.
[164:53.95]I've got such big numbers, believe me.
[164:58.33]And the poles, I have the best poles.
[165:00.29]Can I tell you something?
[165:01.17]Can I be truthful with you?
[165:02.11]Honestly, I've got the best poles.
[165:03.77]Believe me.
[165:11.72]Alright, funny to use the dirty finger.
[165:13.36]That's illery.
[165:17.22]There's no H. He doesn't say H. He says illery.
[165:20.42]Let me tell you something about illery.
[165:24.77]She's a nasty, nasty woman.
[165:27.25]Nasty Hillary.
[165:28.09]That's what I'm talking about.
[165:38.96]Who have I not seen?
[165:40.18]We haven't seen Papa Big.
[165:46.21]Why the hate for the Steam Controller?
[165:48.07]It's not good.
[165:50.57]I tried to use it.
[165:51.87]I bought one.
[165:52.44]And it just wasn't working for me at all.
[165:56.14]Not at all.
[165:59.22]The right stick just feels wonky and it's hard to get a right sensitivity on it.
[166:04.85]The left... Both the trackpads just feel like they're too slow with tracking things.
[166:11.25]And when you up the speed on them, it's just... It doesn't feel right.
[166:16.20]There's maybe, like, two or three specific... very, very specific places I'd use the Steam Controller.
[166:21.46]And none of them... other than that, no other place.
[166:26.50]Believe me.
[166:29.69]Oh no, look out!
[166:30.67]Another Dark Spirit!
[166:32.25]Can you guess?
[166:36.01]We're gonna take... okay, we're gonna take this real slow.
[166:37.59]Am I really gonna put on the fucking armor again?
[166:39.87]Fuck the... I'm taking too much damage.
[166:42.53]Just put on a dumb little hat or something.
[166:44.07]Who cares?
[166:48.38]I know, Ilarissa, this one is huge.
[166:50.34]What the fuck is even happening right now?
[166:54.92]I probably said that a hundred- somebody's dead, he's dead.
[166:56.58]Good, we win.
[166:58.10]We win again.
[166:58.54]Uh, Papa- I didn't even know that guy was in the game, and Papa Big took care of him.
[167:04.14]Can we just get like a small round of applause?
[167:07.75]For the main man, Papa Big, killing an invader that I didn't even know existed.
[167:18.22]Hillary Watch out Watch out Where it gets ugly every time is when we get on top of the house
[167:44.34]We have to just kill the invaders and then... Yeah, just stay close-knit together.
[167:49.35]Here comes another one.
[167:50.19]Where is he?
[167:51.59]I just heard it.
[167:55.47]Yeah, just be aware.
[167:59.50]Stay as a team.
[168:02.88]And then get inside a house.
[168:04.12]They're probably alright here.
[168:05.06]I'm gonna get dropped on.
[168:05.86]I knew I was gonna get dropped on, but it was an NPC.
[168:10.71]There he is.
[168:11.03]There he is.
[168:11.31]There he is.
[168:11.55]He's behind us.
[168:11.93]Behind us.
[168:13.07]No, he's not.
[168:13.43]I'm just freaking the fuck out.
[168:19.99]I'm so scared.
[168:22.57]Everywhere is dangerous.
[168:23.57]And these are like the same guy.
[168:26.37]They're like the same glowy weapon shit.
[168:28.01]Alright, let's go.
[168:35.56]Is the right way?
[168:36.74]Not this way.
[168:38.22]It's up here.
[168:41.30]Just gonna stay back in Castle Arrows, fuck this.
[168:50.21]I'm voting for Jeb.
[168:51.19]Uh, I'm not voting for Jeb Bush.
[168:56.87]Sorry to say.
[169:01.67]Oh, here comes a dark spirit.
[169:07.38]Can't wait to go and get the next bomb.
[169:10.50]Ah, I knew it.
[169:11.38]I know it.
[169:11.68]You're blocking.
[169:12.58]Stop blocking.
[169:13.06]This is too many people in one spot.
[169:19.17]Oh, God.
[169:22.65]Protect your king.
[169:24.05]Protect your king.
[169:24.79]Why am I a king?
