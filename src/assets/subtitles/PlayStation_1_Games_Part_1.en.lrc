[ve:60.16.100]

[01:00.15]Hi, guys.
[01:03.25]Uh, how you doing?
[01:05.51]Oh, well, we're doing another live stream.
[01:06.75]My name's Jeremy.
[01:08.28]What is this?
[01:09.32]What's going on here?
[01:10.42]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:11.36]Sorry.
[01:14.52]Why is it still going?
[01:15.18]Okay, sorry.
[01:17.02]My stream is playing in the background.
[01:20.39]We have a lot of PlayStation 1 to play.
[01:23.49]Probably not going to get through all of it tonight.
[01:27.26]We did some light gun last night.
[01:28.51]I think we maybe change it up a little bit.
[01:29.79]Don't do, like, a bunch of light gun in a row.
[01:34.71]Because I do want to get through PlayStation 1 before we move on to anything else.
[01:38.59]And that's what we're going to do tonight.
[01:41.25]So give me a moment.
[01:43.28]See you in, like, two seconds.
[01:45.80]Maybe a little longer.
[01:47.38]Depending.
[01:50.82]My, like, teeth just fell out.
[03:18.88]Oh, by the way... We're playing Mission Impossible!
[03:25.07]That's the first game on the list!
[03:28.39]Gonna be a spy!
[03:29.07]Gonna be sneaking around!
[03:30.37]Gonna be backstabbing people!
[03:31.51]Gonna be stealing intel!
[03:33.61]As Tom Cruise!
[03:37.37]I don't even have to chat out, hold on.
[03:45.36]This is gonna be bad.
[03:48.29]Don't expect that today you're going to get any games that you've loved playing when you were a kid for PlayStation 1, because we have a lot of garbage in this garbage bag.
[03:58.85]So... I wasn't prepared here.
[04:02.08]Ah, there we go.
[04:03.88]Just loops the theme song.
[04:05.12]I needed to come in with a bang, you know what I mean?
[04:09.26]And we can't wait for this VOD to get muted.
[04:11.26]Wait, is Mission Impossible copyright or is this public domain yet?
[04:16.56]This song is public domain, right?
[04:19.43]I feel like this song has been in so many commercials, TV shows, movies, parties.
[04:24.58]People play this at parties.
[04:26.06]People play this at their wedding to come into, you know what I mean?
[04:28.90]And like, oh, here comes Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson.
[04:32.12]And they think they're fucking hilarious.
[04:34.14]They think they're really funny coming out to this song.
[04:37.58]And like one of them like sneaks around.
[04:39.62]Maybe the bride comes out and puts her hand up to her forehead, looking side to side, left and right.
[04:46.69]Where's the husband?
[04:47.59]Where's the groom?
[04:52.01]When- And then Reigns, and they put a spotlight on him.
[04:55.89]And he's like, oh my god, he's trying to get away from the marriage!
[05:04.46]That's- I'm doing that.
[05:05.96]Nobody steal that, that's what I'm doing.
[05:10.82]Alright, let's fucking play.
[05:14.55]So, let's go, let's do a new game.
[05:16.23]This is all on the classic, authentic PlayStation.
[05:22.52]New game.
[05:22.94]Well, should we do possible or should we do impossible?
[05:28.16]Well, my instinct says I don't want to play an impossible video game.
[05:32.15]So let's do the possible version.
[05:38.45]Why would you?
[05:39.17]This is just yes or no.
[05:41.36]Would you like to complete the game?
[05:42.38]No, I want to do possible.
[05:44.50]I'm not doing impossible.
[05:47.64]Fine.
[05:48.99]Ice Hit.
[05:50.61]Mr. Hunt.
[05:51.69]Please make your selection.
[05:53.99]That's the only thing I can do.
[05:56.97]I'm doing impossible.
[05:59.29]That's the one we're doing.
[06:00.45]Ludquist Base.
[06:04.94]Has anyone ever played this game?
[06:06.06]Is this game any good?
[06:10.62]Let me get the gas out of my stomach before we play.
[06:14.92]Alright, let's go.
[06:15.64]Arriving at the canal, you should land unnoticed.
[06:17.97]Clutter will take... Who gives a shit?
[06:20.03]TLDR.
[06:20.81]Let's get to the bottom.
[06:22.07]Oh yes, the face maker won't work outside this extreme cold.
[06:25.93]I don't know what that means.
[06:27.05]Wait, somebody... To be able to take on someone's identity would be helpful.
[06:30.77]I've got to read this.
[06:31.83]God damn it.
[06:32.63]No, I don't.
[06:33.21]Skip it.
[06:35.19]Okay, should I be Ethan Hunt?
[06:37.82]One of IMF's most reliable agents.
[06:39.70]Highest success rate in the agency.
[06:43.90]Numerous skills make him first choice.
[06:46.20]Jim Phelps.
[06:47.84]Andrew Dowie.
[06:49.38]This is the same guy, but with just like different colored glasses on.
[06:53.90]John Clutter.
[06:55.26]Professional mountain climber is all I needed to see.
[06:56.92]Communicator.
[06:58.33]Field scanner.
[06:58.99]670.
[06:59.01]6-5 silenced.
[07:01.47]Very silent.
[07:02.25]Very deadly.
[07:03.03]No IMF agent would risk death without it.
[07:05.81]Facemaker.
[07:08.43]Let's go with the silencer.
[07:11.79]There we go.
[07:15.17]Is it an FMV cutscene?
[07:16.92]It is.
[07:17.74]Alright, quiet.
[07:27.43]Is it voice acting or is it just one of those dialogue lists?
[07:31.49]Just blow it out.
[07:32.68]That's not how you transport a missile.
[07:34.66]One false move and that whole base goes down.
[07:58.44]Yeah, it's just sitting on a park bench.
[08:03.42]There's two people self-destruct in five seconds.
[08:06.20]What about the people that are over there just enjoying the park?
[08:11.49]There were two people just listening to that whole conversation.
[08:13.29]See, I didn't even need to read that.
[08:16.49]Just fucking Otacon.
[08:24.21]This is just... This is just Otacon in a Woody Allen movie.
[08:25.95]Okay.
[08:26.05]Thanks, Otacon.
[08:54.72]Holy shit, this is old.
[08:57.48]I forget, like, how fucking old this is.
[08:59.80]Wait, what?
[09:00.22]The screen's not even, like, centered.
[09:01.64]Hold on.
[09:04.33]Oh, lord.
[09:05.35]Hold on a second.
[09:07.17]We need to, like, fix the screen.
[09:08.73]Guys, it looks like that on my screen, too.
[09:12.55]I think this just sucks.
[09:17.66]Okay.
[09:18.14]What?
[09:18.58]Is my phone gonna explode?
[09:19.80]Is my phone a bomb?
[09:29.83]That was it.
[09:30.85]He's dead.
[09:33.51]Just fell right with cinder blocks on his feet, right through.
[09:36.53]Okay, let's try it again.
[09:38.35]I have a- Okay, so I- I have until my phone explodes.
[09:43.63]Why would I have a phone bomb on my body?
[09:46.91]Why would you leave that?
[09:48.41]Why is there a time limit?
[09:49.29]Okay.
[09:49.39]Okay, X is jump.
[09:49.87]Square is punch.
[09:50.85]Okay, there's a duck.
[10:01.26]There's the gun.
[10:04.24]On my scanner.
[10:04.88]Okay, there's something on the scanner.
[10:06.09]Is there an aim?
[10:10.87]No.
[10:11.57]How do I aim the gun?
[10:15.05]Okay, I gotta get out of this lock-on mode.
[10:16.73]Here we go.
[10:18.00]I'm running like a total dickhead, by the way.
[10:20.36]Is there a bad guy here?
[10:25.56]How do I open doors?
[10:29.62]No, that's shoot gun.
[10:30.56]Uh, how do I open door?
[10:33.65]Back to the fists?
[10:34.27]What the fuck?
[10:39.61]Hi.
[10:39.75]What?
[10:58.86]Alright, we've... I just, like, dragged him in here like a snake.
[11:03.38]Do I... I'm gonna eat him now?
[11:05.68]Alright, close the door.
[11:06.42]Wait, is there a file?
[11:07.10]Are there files in here?
[11:07.85]I think I gotta steal the data.
[11:11.55]Let me, like, get behind the computer.
[11:16.33]Alright, get... What is that?
[11:20.18]Find excuse for errand done.
[11:23.12]What was the excuse?
[11:24.10]To find my dog?
[11:29.55]Oh, man.
[11:30.17]All right.
[11:30.43]Well, I have a really long, long time limit here.
[11:33.03]This is so hard to control.
[11:40.47]All right.
[11:41.49]If you think about it in retrospect and in hindsight, right?
[11:45.52]If you didn't know that this was on PlayStation 1, how many of you would think this was a cereal box iPad game that I found?
[11:51.22]Let's go.
[11:55.76]I can't turn the camera.
[11:58.12]Stop right there!
[11:59.22]You're under arrest!
[12:03.28]What?
[12:03.54]Punch him?
[12:04.82]Punch this guy!
[12:05.88]I'm running out of time!
[12:06.75]Do you think it's cold here in Lundqvist?
[12:13.39]Wait till you get to Siberia.
[12:14.91]Do I have to break out?
[12:16.81]Who's the other guy that's arrested?
[12:22.38]Can I move?
[12:30.13]I think I just beat the level.
[12:31.03]No, the mission failed.
[12:33.61]Alright, let me get this right.
[12:38.05]So that's actually health.
[12:39.69]That's not a time limit.
[12:42.17]Okay, I'm starting to understand.
[12:44.15]So that's your health bar.
[12:47.53]Why would there be a wick on the end if that's your health bar?
[12:49.89]That's way too stress-inducing.
[12:52.73]How do I sneak?
[12:54.29]Is there a sneak?
[12:58.38]This guy's going to get a guard.
[12:59.76]I can't... The face maker doesn't work here, right?
[13:03.48]That is the... Okay, I'm... Oh, come on!
[13:06.02]Give me a break!
[13:21.41]Crouching is against the law apparently.
[13:29.67]Oh my god.
[13:33.45]No, don't you guys know the rules?
[13:34.49]The rules is we have to give each game at least like 20 to 30 minutes.
[13:42.21]I have to at least get to the... There's some potential here.
[13:50.60]So I can't use the face maker, but I have a silenced gun.
[13:53.18]But can I aim the gun?
[13:54.22]Let me just make sure I'm not crazy here.
[13:56.46]Is there like an aim?
[13:57.42]Yes, there it is.
[13:58.40]Okay.
[13:59.15]And it's inverted.
[14:00.35]Beautiful.
[14:01.91]I'm so happy about that.
[14:03.47]Inverted controls.
[14:05.43]Can you even change it in the menu?
[14:09.79]Nope.
[14:11.72]Okay, so... We're just going to have to try to silently take out everybody here.
[14:21.21]What?
[14:21.57]What?
[14:21.97]What?
[14:22.95]Oh.
[14:30.88]Why?
[14:32.42]Finally, he's not dead.
[14:36.14]Hey, you know what?
[14:39.38]I did pick impossible.
[14:40.99]That's true.
[14:42.09]You guys made me pick impossible.
[14:45.90]It actually is impossible.
[14:47.94]Why did I not pick possible of the two choices there were in the beginning of the game?
[14:54.36]Moon aim.
[14:54.96]Okay, give me a break.
[14:56.56]Do you guys understand how hard this is?
[14:58.96]Like... There's no aim.
[15:03.65]God, like 14-year-old me would have been so good at this game.
[15:07.03]I'm gonna sneak.
[15:11.53]This is the... Okay, this is sneaking.
[15:17.92]Is there a guy over there?
[15:18.82]Is that a guy or is that a truck?
[15:22.17]Do they look at footprints?
[15:24.35]Why?
[15:24.62]This guy wasn't here before!
[15:47.83]I have to get by.
[15:49.31]No, fuck this.
[15:50.09]We're doing Possible.
[15:51.13]I'm going back and I'm going to pick Possible.
[15:54.67]I don't care what anybody says.
[15:55.65]New game, Possible.
[15:57.62]Ice hit.
[15:58.78]We're going to be the main character, Ethan Hunt.
[16:01.98]We're going to use... We're going to use the field scanner.
[16:07.30]No shit, I need the gun.
[16:08.92]Skip everything.
[16:10.24]Arriving at the canal, you should land unnoticed.
[16:12.94]Clutter will take the long way around to join you near the tunnel entrance.
[16:21.95]You guys thought it was just a joke.
[16:23.09]It is literally impossible.
[16:24.97]Let's see what the difference is.
[16:27.77]Wait, didn't I pick the same guy?
[16:35.48]You just get a gun anyways.
[16:37.54]Okay, go check out the white dot.
[16:46.85]I can't, how do I turn, I can't turn the camera.
[16:54.21]You know what I mean?
[16:54.63]Like, the camera... Here we go.
[16:56.43]He's gonna come over and be like, Oh, I am looking for a dog.
[17:03.71]Okay, we're gonna give this, like, one small attempt.
[17:06.83]Alright.
[17:07.33]Found excuse for errand.
[17:09.92]I don't even know what I picked up.
[17:12.96]Can I select it or something?
[17:16.02]I don't think that I can select it.
[17:16.94]What does select do?
[17:18.36]Nothing.
[17:19.20]Wait, okay, wait, wait.
[17:19.72]What's this?
[17:20.02]Okay, well, I got it.
[17:22.67]Here.
[17:23.37]No.
[17:23.59]Oh my god.
[17:25.02]Don't I have a thing in my pocket?
[17:27.12]What did I do to him?
[17:29.04]I sneezed on him and he died.
[17:33.14]I'm good.
[17:33.84]I did a deadly sneeze.
[17:54.17]Now let me get, what do I, okay, the, where do I have to go?
[17:57.35]The white dot?
[18:02.45]Oh shit, go- God damn it.
[18:10.19]I don't understand.
[18:11.97]The face back doesn't work.
[18:13.71]Alright, I think it's time to move on.
[18:16.39]I don't know if we can get past the first level in Mission Impossible the video game.
[18:21.51]Should I give it one more try before we move on to, uh, one of my favorites growing up?
[18:26.68]Last try.
[18:27.38]One more and that's it.
[18:30.14]I'm gonna just, I'm gonna sprint and shoot.
[18:31.72]That's all I'm gonna do.
[18:32.28]I'm gonna just, I'm gonna shoot.
[18:33.64]Just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[18:36.00]That seems like the only real solution.
[18:39.26]I need to get to Siberia first.
[18:41.52]That's not gonna work.
[18:42.32]Alright, gun.
[18:42.94]We're just gonna run through.
[18:53.48]Let's go this way.
[18:54.22]I feel like there's a couple of guys.
[18:55.88]There's a guy there.
[18:58.42]Just run over here.
[18:59.58]There's an open door this way.
[19:03.34]Can I get in there?
[19:05.14]Is that a barn?
[19:06.20]Alright, this is the furthest I've gotten in the entire game.
[19:08.23]The furthest you guys have ever seen.
[19:12.23]Oh shit, there's a light.
[19:13.27]Alright, I just gotta get through that front door and I can move on to the next game.
[19:17.21]Here we go.
[19:23.42]I can't even see anything.
[19:26.18]Did I just turn around?
[19:26.96]I don't even know which direction I'm facing.
[19:28.21]Wait, wait, wait!
[19:28.63]Guy, guy, guy!
[19:29.03]There's a guy!
[19:30.69]They didn't see me yet.
[19:31.23]Where are they going?
[19:36.67]Where's that guy going?
[19:40.85]Where's that equivalent of a ghost on an old monitor?
[19:43.43]There he goes.
[19:44.29]Yep, see?
[19:44.82]The ghost is gone.
[19:47.25]Top 10 scariest found footages from a security tape.
[19:52.81]They're like dust and mist goes by and it looks like a face.
[19:56.28]Yeah, it was fucked up.
[19:58.70]There's a guy right here.
[19:59.42]Alright, if I crouch, does that immediately pull them over here?
[20:05.84]Oh my fucking god, just go over this way.
[20:18.61]Am I lined up correctly here?
[20:20.85]Why is this guy sprinting back and forth?
[20:23.89]What happened?
[20:24.53]Who shot me?
[20:31.01]Got him.
[20:32.07]Okay, I made it in.
[20:35.79]Where do I go now?
[20:42.79]I thought that was train tracks.
[20:52.74]At the last second, I thought maybe that's water.
[20:54.62]I thought it was train tracks.
[20:56.54]Let's go in the options for a second.
[20:58.34]Hold on.
[20:58.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:59.70]Controller.
[21:01.50]Attack inventory.
[21:03.84]It looked like train tracks.
[21:05.14]You know, all right, we're going to move on to my next favorite game ever.
[21:07.18]You're going to get like a blue screen flash.
[21:11.45]So here's a warning for you.
[21:12.47]Like it's going to be like a bright blue screen here in about 10 seconds.
[21:17.75]Shorter than that.
[21:18.27]Like now, like right now it's going to happen.
[21:20.29]Warning.
[21:25.09]All right, I'm gonna put it on the next game.
[21:30.56]Ah, fuck, that hurt.
[21:33.50]Okay, it has to enjoy your blue screen.
[21:36.10]Incoming next game.
[21:39.24]Really like this one.
[21:40.19]I feel like you guys are gonna love this one.
[21:43.55]I know I will.
[21:47.71]Remember that?
[21:48.45]Ah, the old PlayStation sound.
[21:52.19]Feels great.
[21:56.89]Let's see how this looks in the monitor there.
[22:03.59]This one we might play for even shorter than Mission Impossible.
[22:10.16]BMX.
[22:13.78]Interactive.
[22:19.56]There's the Dark Portal.
[22:20.64]No, that's a guillotine.
[22:21.99]What company is this?
[22:23.80]Boss Game Studios.
[22:25.04]Oh, this is Cliffy B's new studio.
[22:26.88]Boss Games.
[22:27.64]Boss Key.
[22:29.67]National University Nanotechnology Research Laboratory.
[22:37.03]A couple of scientists in here doing all kinds of absolutely strange, deranged projects.
[22:45.59]He's currently working on a spider.
[22:46.95]A nano spider.
[22:57.26]Is that his brain?
[23:00.80]Hold on, so the spider has a human brain?
[23:03.64]It's alive!
[23:13.23]This is the lab from Gremlins 2.
[23:22.76]So that's me.
[23:23.52]So I'm controlling the nanotechnology spider.
[23:28.08]Yes, that is this game.
[23:29.68]Microsoft is involved here.
[23:32.02]I want that technology.
[23:34.60]Am I the fish now?
[23:40.09]Let's see.
[23:40.61]So in comes the bad guy's henchman to come steal the secret recipe.
[23:46.71]They come to get the Krabby Patty recipe.
[23:48.19]Okay, here they are.
[23:53.28]No!
[23:55.16]Wait, he said steal the recipe, not destroy everything and kill the guy involved.
[23:58.69]How are they missing?
[24:06.11]I'm gonna put myself into the spider!
[24:08.44]That's my only escape!
[24:14.08]Yeah, he's gonna be in the spider.
[24:18.08]Stop, you fool!
[24:19.42]Nice 3D Movie Maker sound.
[24:22.25]That was a voice file from 3D Movie Maker.
[24:26.89]Yep, he's in the spider.
[24:38.82]Please tell me I'm using... Am I using the computer?
[24:48.17]Seinfeld?
[24:52.30]What are these?
[24:52.88]I love how the opening cutscene is inherently probably more interesting than the game's going to be.
[25:02.36]Spider, the video game.
[25:04.01]That is an ugly logo.
[25:08.29]They're trying to do, like, Da Vinci bullshit there.
[25:10.31]Yeah, this is Spider, the video game.
[25:16.86]Yeah, sorry.
[25:17.68]That's what we're doing.
[25:19.48]There are no audio options.
[25:20.60]What the fuck am I thinking?
[25:22.48]Let's go.
[25:29.43]Level 1.
[25:31.19]I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[25:32.29]Laboratory.
[25:33.43]Lab floor.
[25:37.16]There are levels.
[25:38.46]I'm going to do level 1.
[25:39.20]Okay.
[25:48.41]How do I move the spider?
[25:49.81]Oh, like that.
[25:54.04]I can only move in one direction.
[26:02.90]There's no up or down.
[26:04.26]How do I attack?
[26:04.86]Why are there other spiders?
[26:10.79]So I'm a fucking nanotechnology spider?
[26:14.63]I'm probably worth 40 million dollars and some random shitty house spider can kill me in one hit That was kind of cool Climbing on like the Xbox 360, you know, that's why they put it in Yeah, I can only move there's only one direction you can move in This is like a PlayStation 2 nice
[26:40.96]Is that a person?
[26:43.37]What's this lady?
[26:44.07]I have a flamethrower face.
[26:51.97]This is fucking terrible.
[26:58.03]How many people do you think would leave this stream if I told you guys that we were going to play this for the rest of the night?
[27:03.57]And I was going to try to beat this whole game.
[27:06.07]In fact, not only was I going to beat the whole game, I was...
[27:10.87]I refuse to play another video game on this stream or stream anything until this game is at 100% completion, no matter how long it takes, doesn't matter how long it takes.
[27:25.12]Okay, can we just pretend that was the whole game?
[27:26.64]No, I bought, I bought, how much was this?
[27:28.84]This was $10.
[27:31.30]Yes, this is $10.
[27:32.93]And am I ashamed?
[27:35.07]Absolutely.
[27:36.73]Do I regret it?
[27:37.77]No.
[27:38.83]But I can be ashamed of it.
[27:41.58]What's going on here?
[27:49.45]Go, go on.
[27:51.05]Lab floor.
[27:51.79]Factory 1.
[27:53.13]1.
[27:58.27]I think I beat the game.
[28:08.21]Well, that's it.
[28:11.17]Uh...
[28:12.89]That was Spider.
[28:13.99]No, we can't go that.
[28:15.13]Yeah, we can.
[28:15.73]There's a lot in here.
[28:16.63]Oh, I can't wait to play this one.
[28:18.85]This one's going to be my favorite of the night, guaranteed.
[28:21.69]Who gives a shit about the Spider game when you have this one coming up?
[28:24.89]And even just the front cover is worth it.
[28:28.27]This is going to be the best game of the whole night, guaranteed.
[28:33.73]Well, that's the fastest you've ever seen somebody lose $10.
[28:35.45]It was right now.
[28:37.46]Flash blue screen coming up in three, two, one.
[28:47.19]Every time I say this, it's always the one that I'm never expecting to be the fun one.
[28:52.01]But you can't really go wrong with this one, I don't think.
[28:55.97]There's a 1-800, no, there's a 1-900 number in here for hints for the game.
[29:00.01]Okay.
[29:07.27]You guys ready for this one?
[29:08.97]All right, so, need a hint.
[29:12.90]There's a 1-900 number here, and it's 95 cents per minute, and it's $1.95 for a fax back of a map.
[29:25.51]So you pay $2 and they fax you a map of parts of the game.
[29:30.15]Must be 18 years or older or have your parents' permission.
[29:34.67]A dollar a minute to get... to get hints for this game.
[29:41.20]Always watch the opening cutscene.
[29:42.96]Okay, that just kind of freaked me out.
[29:44.46]I thought I'd just hit like... Perfect.
[29:47.18]This is Courier Crisis, by the way.
[29:48.48]You like punch people in the face and you're right around them to fight.
[29:51.56]This is gonna be the best game you've ever seen.
[29:56.25]This Cujo dog.
[30:00.33]He's like drunk, guys.
[30:01.23]I got farted, I got shit in his pants.
[30:06.97]This kid's drivable cars.
[30:16.51]New levels, the saga of the modern fatalist.
[30:20.35]Fatalist, what does that even... What the fuck does that even mean?
[30:30.31]I'm ready to complete this one.
[30:31.52]We're going to be on this one for like at least 30 or 40 minutes.
[30:34.52]I'm not going to call the 1-900 number.
[30:36.20]I don't want to be put on a scam list.
[30:40.56]I hate that sound.
[30:41.74]This memory card.
[30:46.49]What did these even... I don't know what these are trying to tell me.
[30:51.79]Is this controls?
[30:53.63]Like, buy a bike.
[30:55.64]Price.
[30:56.04]Cash flow.
[30:59.78]Cash flow.
[31:00.76]Interceptor.
[31:01.36]Should I buy one of these?
[31:02.18]Wow, look at that thing.
[31:05.90]Banana bike.
[31:09.21]It really is a stapler.
[31:11.35]Let's just go.
[31:11.79]Let's just see what the game is.
[31:13.23]And give it a try.
[31:14.19]Civic Center level 1.
[31:15.03]We need the rocket bike?
[31:23.65]It's probably gonna require I play this game for four hours to get the rocket bike.
[31:27.44]Alright, how do I ride the bike?
[31:28.70]Alright, you can kick left, you can kick right, you can punch left and punch right.
[31:35.36]Does it jump?
[31:36.52]How do I... Alright, that's how you steer.
[31:44.09]What is this song?
[31:45.01]That guy has a pizza!
[31:46.78]Oh yeah, punch him!
[31:51.82]Everybody has pizzas.
[31:52.76]Alright, what do I have to do?
[31:55.68]Okay, I'm going the wrong way, I think.
[32:02.87]Whose fucking garage band is this?
[32:04.85]This is just crazy taxiing on a bike.
[32:09.61]Alright, right here.
[32:11.23]Got it.
[32:12.29]I got it.
[32:12.61]What did I get?
[32:18.77]I wonder why I got fired.
[32:24.56]Uh, press start.
[32:25.40]What do you mean press start?
[32:31.72]What is all this shit?
[32:32.68]Alright, now I just open up.
[32:34.96]I have open world now.
[32:38.89]Restart.
[32:39.61]Alright, let's not fuck it up.
[32:44.59]So if I get it in the... It is just crazy taxi on a bike with terrible graphics.
[32:49.00]How do I brake?
[32:50.12]I can't brake.
[32:50.98]Go the other way.
[32:55.62]You can't pedal up the hill.
[33:02.31]Get it.
[33:04.35]I picked him up.
[33:05.13]I put that guy in my backpack.
[33:07.07]Okay.
[33:09.65]I'm dying over here.
[33:13.15]Give it to him.
[33:14.26]Give him the- Alright, that's good.
[33:17.12]Next, what, we got a dog?
[33:18.04]I have to deliver a dog?
[33:22.98]Deliver it to this guy.
[33:23.88]Mission complete.
[33:30.16]Why would they have a kick and a punch in this game?
[33:32.72]It seems like that makes no sense.
[33:33.70]$11?
[33:37.53]Yeah, remember, this is $11 20 years ago.
[33:44.51]That's like $21.
[33:47.11]Try the next area.
[33:52.93]Okay.
[33:55.61]This sucks.
[33:57.85]Okay, we're going to go to... Oh, boy.
[34:01.73]Industrial Civic Center.
[34:04.75]I guess we're going to go to Chinatown.
[34:08.28]I think we need some hints.
[34:09.34]Yeah, I'm going to call that number.
[34:10.58]I'm not sure how you do this.
[34:17.60]And more rock music.
[34:23.20]Am I alright?
[34:23.78]It's alright, I'm fine.
[34:25.84]Got it.
[34:26.80]I'm beating this whole game, guys.
[34:28.62]Get out of the way, grandma!
[34:30.20]And... this way.
[34:45.33]This is so dumb.
[34:47.35]I'm almost done with the level.
[34:50.53]Are they saying kill?
[34:55.17]Gotta get the old guy quick before the time's up.
[34:58.13]Damn it!
[34:58.83]Shit!
[34:59.51]I wanted to punch.
[35:00.11]Why?
[35:00.63]Why?
[35:01.35]Calm down.
[35:01.89]I wanted to hit an old guy so bad.
[35:08.43]I did not just do that.
[35:14.23]Kill!
[35:18.11]Kill!
[35:19.49]Level 2, Waterfront.
[35:21.29]Let's go to Waterfront.
[35:27.43]This game does not look good.
[35:28.47]You'd be right.
[35:30.63]Unfortunately, this is not... This is not that great.
[35:36.40]I'm gonna jump this.
[35:36.94]I almost did.
[35:40.04]That would be cool.
[35:40.80]You all know it.
[35:45.68]No, get... That guy just attacked me back.
[35:50.49]Oh, Jesus!
[35:57.85]Okay, that guy's dead.
[35:59.47]I did kill that guy.
[36:02.19]I did murder that person.
[36:03.23]I ran over their head with the bike.
[36:11.28]Wait, you, no, come on.
[36:12.32]This is not, that's not nice.
[36:14.18]That's not nice.
[36:15.02]These are children, okay?
[36:26.61]I got jumped by punch.
[36:27.89]Holy shit.
[36:35.75]Oh my god.
[36:39.14]People thought GTA is bad.
[36:40.58]You can, like, run over people's heads with your bike in this game.
[36:43.94]Where was the outrage, Congress?
[36:53.39]So we have $400 now.
[36:56.33]Am I still playing this game?
[37:00.09]Uh... Waterfront... This is all level 2.
[37:02.91]Waterfront level 2 is... I can't... Can I go here?
[37:13.08]I just did the Final Fantasy VII theme song.
[37:15.68]The Final Fantasy fanfare.
[37:24.42]What about another song?
[37:30.72]How about Mario Brothers?
[37:32.34]I can probably do Super Mario Brothers.
[37:34.06]Level 1-1.
[37:52.80]Fuck me, man.
[37:53.52]Fuck me, you know what I'm saying?
[37:55.18]Replay this area.
[37:57.10]I guess I didn't do this yet.
[38:08.37]This guy's fucked.
[38:13.51]And the crowd goes wild.
[38:14.51]Alright, let's be disgusting.
[38:19.21]Ready?
[38:19.43]Watch this.
[38:28.17]No, I didn't want to... I didn't mean to... That kid got hit by a car!
[38:31.51]I didn't do anything to that kid.
[38:33.51]I didn't do anything!
[38:34.87]That kid just got hit by a bus.
[38:36.45]Alright, that's what happened.
[38:40.13]Apparently I'm a kid, too.
[38:42.68]Jesus Christ.
[38:44.12]That kid.
[38:45.38]Oh my lord in heaven.
[38:46.74]Where is it?
[38:58.43]I can't turn this way.
[38:59.27]What?
[39:04.72]Where is it?
[39:05.98]Where is this?
[39:07.18]You pointed me in the wrong... Oh, Christ.
[39:11.32]Alright, we're fine.
[39:12.84]Get out of the way!
[39:13.62]I had to go down this little alley.
[39:17.29]Where is this guy?
[39:23.39]No!
[39:24.13]Got it.
[39:28.95]I'm fine!
[39:30.67]I'm alright!
[39:32.89]What is in the way?
[39:33.67]Get... Get out of the way!
[39:36.49]Oh, kid, I don't want to have to hurt anybody.
[39:38.17]Come on, get... Please!
[39:40.07]I'm... I'm... No.
[39:44.69]I gotta turn.
[39:48.56]Okay, you know what's gonna happen.
[39:50.34]I would've sat there and it would've been terrible!
[39:52.76]Oh, I lost.
[39:57.95]Hold on.
[39:58.65]This is important.
[39:59.71]I'm sorry.
[40:01.51]I'm sorry.
[40:03.65]But sometimes you need to... You sometimes need to understand something here.
[40:08.97]You understand what we need to see here?
[40:11.07]We need to sit here for a very particular reason.
[40:13.53]And you all know what it is.
[40:14.39]Oh my god.
[40:24.22]My god, oh my god Wow No, not again, no Don't don't do it kid.
[40:47.42]Don't do it.
[40:47.98]That's a bad idea.
[40:48.82]Oh
[40:52.89]Holy shit.
[40:55.19]Why would they ever allow this?
[40:58.64]Why would they allow this?
[41:02.80]And why am I watching it?
[41:04.48]Alright, let's move.
[41:10.44]I need to restart.
[41:16.80]That was fucking... Got it.
[41:22.83]I don't even have any words, man.
[41:23.97]That was... That was unbelievable.
[41:26.51]I'm like... I'm like... I feel terrible.
[41:28.97]I don't feel good right now.
[41:30.41]I feel bad.
[41:34.23]Shit.
[41:35.09]No.
[41:35.51]Why are there this many?
[41:38.22]Why do you have this many, like, kids on skateboards?
[41:41.36]Where are their parents?
[41:44.10]Hey!
[41:47.16]You little dick!
[41:49.65]You just Bart Simpsoned me!
[41:52.84]Ah, sorry, kid.
[41:53.64]Nobody Bart Simpson's me.
[41:58.04]Holy shit, he's kicking my ass.
[42:05.21]That guy tried to... I'm sorry.
[42:07.89]I need to stop, like, looking for this.
[42:18.34]The kids are just kicking the shit out of me.
[42:20.76]Alright, let's go.
[42:23.07]No more fucking around.
[42:24.25]Why would they do this?
[42:25.65]I don't understand.
[42:27.41]That seems like... Who was the guy that sat there that was coding the game that was like, Hey, you know what would be great to put in the game?
[42:34.44]How about half the pedestrians are skip-walking children?
[42:41.58]I got 68% of every person that's a pedestrian is gonna be like a four-year-old.
[42:46.49]That sounds good.
[42:47.37]I thought that was a fire hydrant.
[42:50.85]In my headcanon, that was a fire hydrant.
[42:53.19]I thought that was a fire hydrant.
[42:54.83]I just saw like a red... Alright, which way is it?
[42:58.18]It's like down a little alleyway, right?
[43:05.18]Oh my god, this is... Restart.
[43:14.86]Stop it.
[43:16.20]I just want to complete the mission.
[43:17.46]I don't want to do anything else.
[43:24.05]Speaking of children, this is a kid singing.
[43:27.17]Okay, where is it?
[43:32.25]Right here.
[43:37.52]Oh, come on.
[43:51.39]Let me just beat the level.
[43:56.06]I need to get the super radioactive bike.
[44:02.08]Move, please.
[44:02.62]Oh my god.
[44:05.90]Just get out of the way.
[44:07.22]So I can complete this mission.
[44:08.14]So we can move on.
[44:09.12]Alright, we're good.
[44:20.40]The music is even more compressed than the textures.
[44:24.48]Yes, it is.
[44:24.92]Who made this game?
[44:25.85]GT Interactive Software.
[44:27.63]Somebody do a little bit of a detective work and find out what they became.
[44:30.99]Did they become a new studio?
[44:32.17]Who is it?
[44:34.25]Who's the studio?
[44:35.05]I don't want to buy any bikes.
[44:43.45]So what is going on with the replay this area?
[44:45.97]No.
[44:47.29]I can't unlock any shit here?
[44:48.97]Chinatown level 2.
[44:55.95]They died in 1999.
[45:00.54]Ceased operations in 1999.
[45:02.76]Well, hmm.
[45:04.70]People are just getting hit by cars.
[45:05.78]You didn't even get to see that one.
[45:09.90]Turn.
[45:11.24]Quick.
[45:11.64]There's only two here.
[45:14.14]Come on, get up.
[45:15.97]Go!
[45:18.59]That's a really angry guy coming over here.
[45:20.41]I can't even turn.
[45:27.21]The framerate is so bad, I actually can't even tell where my character's going.
[45:33.72]Got it.
[45:37.22]I'm gonna puke with this framerate.
[45:39.14]It's gonna make me actually throw up.
[45:46.00]Come here.
[45:48.22]Alright.
[45:58.19]4x4 resolution.
[45:59.77]Yeah.
[46:00.39]Even worse than that.
[46:02.13]I want to unlock one of the bikes and then we'll move on.
[46:08.09]I got 575.
[46:08.69]Let's unlock a bike.
[46:14.05]We got a Mach 1, Calera, Pro Freestyle Tour.
[46:21.73]That's too much money.
[46:22.55]These are all too much money.
[46:23.43]We have to buy this one here.
[46:25.69]This one.
[46:27.11]Buy this ride.
[46:28.07]Exit.
[46:28.55]What?
[46:29.03]Why would you?
[46:30.69]What the fuck was that?
[46:32.90]Buy this ride.
[46:34.90]No.
[46:36.24]Exit is the other option.
[46:37.62]What are you talking about?
[46:39.91]Buy this ride!
[46:41.13]Where's... Yes!
[46:42.17]Oh my god.
[46:42.99]It's yours, baby.
[46:43.97]Alright.
[46:51.01]Level 3, Civic Center.
[46:53.18]How do I unlock the other two levels?
[47:00.54]Do I go faster on this bike?
[47:03.04]Probably.
[47:04.44]Oh yeah, I do.
[47:09.41]This is level 3.
[47:10.62]If I don't unlock something after this, we'll move on.
[47:17.28]There's a new NPC.
[47:18.12]There's like a police officer NPC.
[47:19.90]Let's check and see what that does.
[47:27.94]What's going on?
[47:29.54]Alright, the bike just freaked out on me.
[47:31.12]I need to see what this guy does.
[47:35.51]Alright, this is the new NPC.
[47:43.94]He doesn't do anything.
[47:47.10]That guy went so far.
[47:52.13]Watch out for the phone booth.
[47:53.17]Alright, I gotta complete it.
[47:54.67]I gotta be perfect here.
[48:01.97]That animation.
[48:03.22]I have no control of the bike!
[48:08.12]Almost there.
[48:08.56]Oh, the tree!
[48:19.57]Next turn.
[48:22.47]Got it.
[48:25.09]I do find it fun.
[48:25.75]What is the point of the jump?
[48:27.81]Jump doesn't do... That's a really high jump.
[48:35.63]Oh, I just collapsed on that guy's head.
[48:39.23]I'm gonna get fired.
[48:40.37]I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[48:44.51]I died.
[48:44.93]This is every single song in Gone Home.
[48:50.40]Go play Gone Home and you'll hear this song 30 times.
[48:54.49]Oh my god.
[48:55.25]No, no, no, no, no.
[49:05.33]Why did I fall off the bike?
[49:12.88]Did I unlock anything new?
[49:15.98]Quotes.
[49:16.72]Play.
[49:17.12]Play.
[49:20.14]Alright, here we go.
[49:22.32]I see some potential violence here.
[49:26.83]So who knows what the hell is going to happen here.
[49:28.07]This is the new level.
[49:29.05]We have to try this.
[49:37.93]What's the problem here?
[49:39.01]Alright, what?
[49:42.15]Somebody has a machine gun?
[49:44.61]What's going on here?
[49:51.35]What was that?
[49:53.33]Why are there just dogs everywhere?
[49:57.78]What the f- No!
[50:03.68]They're just wild, rabid animals?
[50:08.10]What is going on?
[50:10.18]Who are these people that are getting these packages delivered?
[50:15.27]No, get out of the way!
[50:16.17]Move!
[50:22.97]I can't move.
[50:23.51]I'm stuck.
[50:29.78]Alright, I'm gonna get fired.
[50:31.40]Can I jump over the buildings?
[50:34.02]Alright, go!
[50:37.54]Go!
[50:41.32]I'm not doing anything.
[50:42.95]People are getting run over by cars.
[50:44.01]That's not me.
[50:48.33]Just complete this so I can be done.
[50:54.16]And on the corner... No, god damn it!
[50:56.62]I'm gonna fail.
[51:03.76]Yeah, I don't think you can run over any dogs.
[51:07.12]Pretty sure it's not possible, but... And you know what else is impossible?
[51:09.66]Apparently this level.
[51:14.68]Alright, I'm gonna just lose.
[51:16.02]I can't... Alright, that's it.
[51:19.17]This is... Here come the dogs again.
[51:25.64]Do I have a health bar?
[51:34.73]I was just waiting for a car to come drive and fucking by and crush everybody.
[51:42.43]What?
[51:50.46]You're a loser, punk.
[51:52.68]Try it again.
[51:53.18]Now!
[51:56.96]How about not?
[52:00.58]And we're going to move on to... No, that's too good of a game.
[52:04.40]Ah, this one looks good.
[52:06.17]This one looks like we're going to have a grand old time.
[52:12.95]So out of the three here, this is probably the most video game that we've played.
[52:22.73]Let's continue that trend of not video game and play this one.
[52:28.34]No, don't ever turn the power off when it's loading.
[52:31.08]That's an extreme, extreme problem for these old consoles.
[52:34.90]I gotta wait.
[52:35.93]Blue, big blue screen's coming.
[52:38.61]In three, I didn't, wait, what was it?
[52:40.45]What the hell?
[52:41.61]How's he doing those moves?
[52:44.21]What the f- Why wasn't I doing these?
[52:46.51]What the fuck is this?
[52:47.98]I wasn't doing these?
[52:55.63]This game just got so much cooler, and it's a game I wasn't even playing.
[52:58.59]This is a dev plan.
[53:03.95]He knows how to do all these moves.
[53:06.51]Jumping cars.
[53:07.43]I'll just watch this for a minute.
[53:14.97]That's so cool.
[53:15.85]Blue screen.
[53:16.51]3, 2, 1.
[53:17.17]No, I can't.
[53:18.59]The game's loading.
[53:19.21]God, I can't turn it off when it's loading.
[53:24.85]Okay, blue screen, here it comes.
[53:26.63]Sorry.
[53:33.13]Sometimes people ask me, why do you buy these games?
[53:35.98]For instance, this one, that one was also $10.
[53:38.00]This one, I opened it and the CD case fell apart, broke in half.
[53:45.19]You can definitely tell this one wasn't taken care of, whoever used to own this.
[53:48.37]And I don't blame them at all, because why would you take care of... Why would you take care of Pamela Anderson VIP spy game?
[53:56.91]I don't know why you would.
[53:59.81]Somebody got this accidentally for Christmas 20 years ago.
[54:05.72]I just hope there's no nudity in this game.
[54:11.32]There might be.
[54:12.66]I just...
[54:13.89]Now, this is rated teen.
[54:15.83]Suggestive themes and vibes.
[54:17.23]Well, there's some suggestive nudity.
[54:19.44]There's not actual nudity.
[54:22.22]This is Pamela Anderson's VIP.
[54:24.08]Let's go.
[54:31.92]New game.
[54:32.66]Continue gallery.
[54:34.66]I wonder what it's going to be.
[54:35.47]I wonder if it's going to be pictures of Pamela Anderson.
[54:38.35]Oh, I don't have any.
[54:40.10]I don't have any porn magazines buried underneath my PlayStation 1 mattress.
[54:44.16]Not yet.
[54:46.09]Let's go.
[54:52.73]Is it actually... Was she a voice actress?
[54:53.79]This is Dr. Kindle speaking.
[54:58.67]It's urgent I call you.
[55:00.11]For an emergency.
[55:01.05]What's happened exactly, Doctor?
[55:03.08]There are... There are men with guns crawling all over my estate.
[55:06.62]Is there a place you can hide before we get there?
[55:08.64]A place to hide?
[55:09.64]I'm kinda in the middle of a surgery here.
[55:12.67]Are you calling from your clinic or your estate?
[55:14.07]Are you calling from a Hitman game?
[55:15.49]Because that's where it looks like you belong.
[55:16.89]Hurry!
[55:17.65]I need Valerie Irons.
[55:19.45]Your clinic is on your estate?
[55:21.37]What is this?
[55:21.93]20 questions?
[55:23.74]Don't worry, sir.
[55:24.52]We're on the way.
[55:25.60]Val will personally protect you.
[55:27.50]We better wait for Tasha, Quick, and Johnny to back us up.
[55:29.68]Is this Charlie's Angels?
[55:30.68]It's not enough time.
[55:31.66]It's just you and me, Nick.
[55:32.66]Without Charlie?
[55:33.76]You take care of the bad guys, and I'll take care of our client.
[55:36.80]Let's rock and roll.
[55:37.84]Okay, let's rock and roll.
[55:41.18]I see a lot of bogeys.
[55:45.10]Man, I got the Agent Smiths coming for me.
[55:46.70]I gotta go protect the client.
[55:56.06]How... I have a purse in my hand.
[56:01.11]Of course.
[56:01.87]Like Pamela Anderson, VIP.
[56:04.93]What am I doing?
[56:05.57]Follow the instructions.
[56:08.47]Follow the instruction.
[56:10.29]And press the corresponding buttons to defeat the enemies.
[56:18.22]How is that not square?
[56:20.12]Oh.
[56:20.86]What?
[56:22.32]Oh, okay.
[56:22.76]It wants me...
[56:25.85]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[56:28.13]Pamela Anderson's got iron fists.
[56:31.85]Okay.
[56:34.55]Same sound effects from the other game we were just playing.
[56:37.69]Every one of these PlayStation 1, they all share the same stock footage.
[56:42.37]That's too many... You can tell this is motion-capped, by the way.
[56:46.93]Look at the extremely fluid motion capture.
[56:55.42]Did Pamela Anderson do motion cap for this?
[56:56.94]Somebody look it up.
[57:06.70]Alright, now we're inside the house.
[57:08.04]Do I have to do this again?
[57:08.84]Now I have guns?
[57:11.58]Press the directional button to move the cursor and X to fire when you have emptied your weapon.
[57:17.16]Press circle to reload.
[57:19.04]Hold R1 to speed up.
[57:22.44]What do you mean speed up?
[57:30.17]Am I?
[57:31.67]Oh, I thought, okay, is Pamela Anderson controlling this person with her mind?
[57:38.39]I think I'm like plugged into this person.
[57:40.01]I'm controlling her with my brain.
[57:48.99]This is an android.
[57:53.37]None of this matters, you just can spam.
[58:01.94]What am I... I don't even know what I'm speeding up.
[58:04.54]Alright, I'm like gaining in power level, apparently.
[58:18.80]That is the golden eye.
[58:19.74]You shot a guy, Saad.
[58:20.92]Can this be over?
[58:21.82]I don't want to do this anymore.
[58:27.92]Okay, we're good.
[58:32.60]No, we gotta do more of this.
[58:36.76]Do they shoot back?
[58:43.15]Well, here's your light gun segment.
[58:45.25]Let's pretend I'm using the light gun.
[58:51.35]Well, let's get, let's get, okay, no more spamming.
[58:53.17]Let's get, let's actually get a combo going.
[58:55.71]Eight combo.
[58:57.69]Let's try to get to 20.
[59:04.99]20.
[59:05.13]Come on.
[59:06.13]No, not gonna happen.
[59:10.19]Yeah, by the way, why are there this many people attacking this person's house?
[59:12.82]That person has a rocket launcher, I think.
[59:18.12]And honest to goodness?
[59:20.00]Yes, I just said honest to goodness.
[59:23.40]Oh, they're already in the house.
[59:25.67]Why would they be coming?
[59:26.73]The guy they're going after is already in this house.
[59:31.37]You have like 400 people in the house already.
[59:34.07]Nobody can just shoot him right now.
[59:36.92]Why are they all coming to get me?
[59:43.98]Honest to goodness.
[59:49.65]Take the shot, man.
[59:51.46]You can't lose.
[59:52.64]This game was made for... This is just for teenagers to enjoy, you know what I mean?
[59:57.80]Like a 12-year-old would be... No, why would you enjoy this?
[60:00.60]Nobody... I don't enjoy this.
[60:02.46]No one enjoys this.
[60:06.37]What do you mean this is for like a teen... You can't lose.
[60:09.21]The game's terrible.
[60:10.35]No one enjoys... Okay, now I'm... No, Pamela just goes the other direction.
[60:17.88]This game's rated 13+.
[60:18.62]It's rated teen.
[60:20.12]Don't ask me why.
[60:21.50]Oh god.
[60:28.89]Almost.
[60:30.57]I wanna see if there's another game here.
[60:33.83]It's important to know.
[60:36.61]We're doing scientific research on Pamela Anderson's career.
[60:41.24]Is there anything else to do besides terribly aim at enemies?
[60:43.92]And do QTE fighting mechanics.
[60:53.61]I hate... I thought this one was gonna be kind of fun.
[60:55.79]No.
[60:56.63]Not at all.
[60:58.83]Do you think like... I'm trying to think about actually owning this game and playing it and thinking like beating it.
[61:10.04]Getting to a position where you've gotten your money's worth.
[61:13.92]I wonder if this game used to be $50.
[61:14.88]Like $40 or something.
[61:22.77]This is in the same year.
[61:25.49]This came out the same year that Donkey Kong 64 came out.
[61:29.41]You know?
[61:30.13]Like Siphon Filter came out this year.
[61:38.74]There we go.
[61:39.32]That was my crutch.
[61:47.28]Combo lost.
[61:48.34]Oh, well.
[61:48.81]Now we're inside.
[61:49.79]I wonder what I'm gonna do.
[61:51.03]Maybe I'm gonna have to shoot the people.
[62:00.89]Give me something else to do.
[62:03.63]No, it's not gonna be something else.
[62:06.67]Do I get to ever keep on pressing X as quickly as you... I'm gonna destroy this.
[62:13.69]Ready?
[62:21.06]Did I win?
[62:21.96]Okay, I beat him.
[62:34.84]Yikes.
[62:35.16]I just popped a button off of his shirt and got in.
[62:44.89]Ugh.
[62:46.05]We'll do the first... I'll get to the first level of this.
[62:49.41]And then we're gonna have to probably move on.
[62:51.01]Because this is the worst one so far.
[62:53.27]And I thought this was one of those gems we were gonna potentially be super excited about and super happy with.
[63:00.25]No, I'm not happy at all.
[63:07.92]I'm incredibly unhappy playing this.
[63:10.82]But I have to.
[63:12.94]Whoops.
[63:17.21]Who is this person?
[63:20.73]Okay, it's Pamela Anderson, and then is this just some random... I'm also in this game, but I'm not an actress or anything?
[63:26.74]Who is this?
[63:28.16]Do we even know this person's name?
[63:29.70]She's in half the game so far.
[63:31.30]She's done more work than Pamela.
[63:43.59]She's the co-worker from the show.
[63:45.21]What show?
[63:47.81]It was a TV show?
[63:48.91]Oh, this is a TV show?
[63:53.05]Oh, fuck.
[63:59.11]Hold on.
[64:02.31]Yeah.
[64:04.27]I thought this was just a terrible video game.
[64:06.12]This is also a terrible TV show, too?
[64:12.04]What?
[64:12.26]You think I know about any of this shit?
[64:14.74]Sorry I didn't keep up with my Pamela Anderson lore.
[64:24.98]Join forces with the lethal and sexy Valerie Irons, Pamela Anderson, and the rest of the VIP team as you set out on crime-busting missions to protect a well-known cosmetic surgeon from Los Angeles' most notorious mobster.
[64:37.19]That's a lot of points.
[64:50.85]Can I be done?
[64:51.41]We were going to sit there for a long time if I let that go.
[64:55.79]Let's see.
[64:59.85]I guess I am looking at the front cover.
[65:03.62]There are actual people on here.
[65:07.04]What is special?
[65:10.36]Uh oh.
[65:15.84]Would you like to buy this photo?
[65:18.03]No, I would not.
[65:20.95]Nope, I would not.
[65:22.75]What about movie?
[65:25.23]Would you like to buy this movie for $50,000?
[65:27.40]Yes.
[65:28.78]Oh, this is just the intro cutscene.
[65:30.42]Why would I pay for this?
[65:32.06]I just paid for that.
[65:32.92]That's the opening cutscene.
[65:39.12]These aren't even real pictures.
[65:40.20]These are just pictures from the game that we've already seen.
[65:43.13]Is this a real picture?
[65:44.05]All right, there you go.
[65:48.83]This is an incredibly pixelated image.
[65:51.52]Oh, what about $10,000 for an image of this guy in a coffee shop?
[65:55.82]No, it's a guy in a car.
[65:57.58]Who cares?
[66:05.61]This is the last chance we're going to give this game.
[66:15.29]No, I've already given up.
[66:16.79]I'm done.
[66:20.33]I can't.
[66:20.71]This is it.
[66:21.19]We're just gonna get the same exact game over and over again.
[66:26.93]That's it.
[66:27.31]We have to move on to something else.
[66:33.27]What do we got here?
[66:34.91]Oh, yes.
[66:36.07]Absolutely.
[66:37.67]Now I'm excited again.
[66:41.30]Here comes the blue screen.
[66:44.48]Snap the disc on camera.
[66:45.98]No.
[66:48.97]I was just gonna say I was gonna donate this.
[66:50.62]I was gonna donate this.
[66:55.70]What?
[66:59.64]Why would I do that?
[67:02.91]Nobody wants this.
[67:06.67]That's a pretty good image there.
[67:09.51]Donated to the trash.
[67:10.82]Blue screen coming in.
[67:20.24]So this one has a potential to be equally as bad or... Good.
[67:26.28]I don't know.
[67:26.60]I can't tell.
[67:31.54]Help, it's blue.
[67:35.60]Well, it won't be for very long.
[67:39.48]How many of you guys remember the Animorphs?
[67:45.63]We're about to play by Scholastic.
[67:47.98]Scholastic presents Animorphs Shattered Reality.
[67:53.90]Back when Scholastic had a video game development district of their company.
[68:02.00]Subsidiary, whatever you want to call it.
[68:08.49]Infogrames.
[68:09.29]Why does that sound like they fucked up and said the wrong word?
[68:12.33]Alright.
[68:14.45]Let's do it.
[68:16.04]I have high hopes for this one.
[68:21.38]This was on awful games done quick.
[68:25.53]Was it?
[68:27.43]Why would you speed run this game?
[68:30.87]Why would you put yourself through so much pain to speed run something like this?
[68:41.20]I am an elemist.
[68:42.66]What is the official speedrun of this game?
[68:46.76]Time.
[68:46.98]For any percent.
[68:48.52]My interests have taken me far and wide, studying beings on worlds throughout the cosmos.
[68:56.53]Recently, my attention has been drawn to a conflict on a small blue world known as Earth.
[69:06.06]Earth.
[69:08.82]Two hours and 22 minutes.
[69:10.63]No.
[69:10.69]44... Who has the real... Who has the real time?
[69:12.93]I'm now a brave slug slave.
[69:25.82]Was this the premise of the show?
[69:26.96]Was this the premise of the show?
[69:33.22]Was this a TV show?
[69:34.66]No, this is a book.
[69:37.22]No, this is a TV show.
[69:38.10]Well, they made a book into a TV show, right?
[69:40.04]The crystal exploded.
[69:46.67]No, it was a book.
[69:50.83]It was a book.
[69:52.45]Or was this a Goosebumps scenario where there were... like, 70 books?
[70:03.36]Oh, I can't wait to turn into an animal.
[70:10.75]That guy's a snake.
[70:12.05]No, he's a tiger.
[70:14.77]Uh, let's try to get the animal before it happens.
[70:17.79]Uh, wolf.
[70:19.43]Got it.
[70:21.63]What is that animal?
[70:22.83]What is that alien over there?
[70:24.49]What's that created character?
[70:26.31]That wasn't an animal.
[70:27.63]Who is this guy?
[70:29.59]That was like a kangaroo bird dinosaur.
[70:31.87]That's not a fucking animal.
[70:33.17]What was that?
[70:44.94]Alright, let's go.
[70:45.52]New game.
[70:49.12]Do not disturb.
[70:51.02]Accessing memory card.
[70:52.30]Uh-oh.
[70:54.60]Ooh, scary.
[70:58.41]The entrance.
[71:00.53]Let's go.
[71:06.01]Um... That face.
[71:10.39]Okay, which animal do I want to be?
[71:13.82]Which one's the rhinoceros?
[71:19.76]I don't remember which one was the rhino.
[71:21.64]This was the wolf?
[71:24.48]I think he was the rhino, right?
[71:29.00]Well, that doesn't look right.
[71:31.98]Yeah, why would they use that face?
[71:33.92]It looks like he just sniffed a fart.
[71:38.06]Okay.
[71:40.18]Let's get the buttons down here.
[71:44.21]Just don't touch the red and pick up the coins.
[71:47.53]Ow.
[71:53.98]This is not the game I thought this was gonna be.
[71:55.66]This is just run around and... This is just side-scroller 3D... No, he's a tiger!
[72:02.38]You guys lied to me!
[72:04.22]He's not the... He wasn't the tiger!
[72:05.38]This was the rhino!
[72:07.12]Oh, that was fun!
[72:07.98]I was anamorphed for five seconds!
[72:09.64]What a fun game!
[72:10.58]Oops.
[72:20.70]Who was the- I didn't know it would be the tiger.
[72:22.32]Oh shit!
[72:29.91]I'm fine.
[72:33.79]It's just slow Sonic.
[72:35.83]It really is.
[72:36.55]The voice is Sonic too.
[72:41.38]Oh man.
[72:50.44]That, okay, that was not cool.
[72:54.90]Somebody tell me how that made any sense.
[73:04.99]This does remind me of an old PlayStation 1 game.
[73:07.11]Why the fuck is this old Sonic game?
[73:09.29]Don't!
[73:10.35]God damn it.
[73:13.20]Why the fuck is this old Sonic game?
[73:16.79]You know, I'm new to your country.
[73:18.83]I don't understand how to say that.
[73:24.45]I don't know how to speak that.
[73:28.85]What?
[73:41.62]Didn't I just do this part?
[73:46.59]When do I get to turn into an animal?
[73:47.84]I just don't want to walk around as guy in turtleneck.
[73:54.94]Oh, fuck you.
[73:56.18]Oh, no.
[73:59.12]Wow!
[73:59.74]Green slime!
[74:06.14]Oh!
[74:09.52]Shellshock!
[74:12.00]Where's that from?
[74:12.58]Quick!
[74:13.41]Somebody get it quick!
[74:22.73]Fry from Futurama.
[74:29.71]This is what a PlayStation 1 Fry would look like.
[74:39.00]Watch out for the spikes!
[74:43.03]Why am I still playing this?
[74:46.24]It's not from anything.
[74:46.82]That's from Turtles in Time, actually.
[74:48.40]Sorry.
[74:49.82]I win.
[74:51.32]I got three globes, whatever that means.
[74:54.78]You know, I can see how the speedrun of this would be kind of cool.
[75:00.16]Because it's... That is so lame.
[75:09.49]Why even make this an Animorphs game?
[75:15.93]By the way, where's the lady?
[75:17.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, boss fight.
[75:25.57]Isn't that funny?
[75:28.14]This just reminds me of... I want a new StarTropics.
[75:31.08]When are we going to get StarTropics?
[75:32.80]Hmm, Nintendo?
[75:35.06]You're going to give me a new StarTropics, please?
[75:36.86]Because I'm getting StarTropics itches from this.
[75:41.92]What happened with that, Nintendo?
[75:52.88]What do I do?
[75:55.85]Oh.
[75:56.11]We're on a new plane here.
[75:56.89]A new three-dimensional plane.
[75:59.55]I have a time limit now.
[76:06.13]The splits are already on my screen.
[76:11.27]Zero.
[76:11.73]I lost.
[76:13.27]What?
[76:16.80]No, I think that's how long I'm allowed to be an animal for.
[76:19.54]If you fighting that spider takes you more than two minutes... I'm sorry, maybe video games just aren't for you.
[76:27.49]Maybe you should... Maybe you should just take up knitting.
[76:31.93]You know?
[76:34.78]Maybe you should do welding as a hobby.
[76:46.09]Almost didn't make it.
[76:48.79]Got the checkpoint.
[76:49.45]Why am I still playing this?
[76:57.33]Yeah, we know video games are for old folks.
[77:01.72]Watch it, watch out.
[77:07.20]That, I was on it.
[77:08.16]I was clearly on that.
[77:10.50]I'm not gonna complain about game mechanics in a game that is like 41 years old.
[77:20.85]Next game, I know, I can't stop though, I can't stop playing this.
[77:28.09]Look, go until you lose, right?
[77:29.31]Isn't that like what a famous philosopher once said?
[77:36.92]Albert Einstein.
[77:38.44]Go until you lose.
[77:40.96]And he ended up, he was a billionaire, you know what I mean?
[77:42.61]He made all kinds of crazy shit, he made awesome, and he went until he lost, which, I mean, he died.
[77:46.69]Eventually he died.
[77:49.43]Those are words to live by.
[77:51.15]No, fuck that.
[77:51.67]No, I said that.
[77:54.07]Albert Einstein didn't say that.
[77:55.15]I did.
[77:56.13]Go until you lose.
[78:02.97]I'm not going to let Albert Einstein steal one of my quotes.
[78:08.70]You know what was that website?
[78:10.00]Brainiac.com or something?
[78:11.30]Oh, fuck you.
[78:13.28]Brainiac.org?
[78:14.52]Brainiac?
[78:15.24]Braini quotes?
[78:16.80]I'll be listed there one day.
[78:33.68]I hate this game.
[78:35.04]Why am I doing this?
[78:37.84]Spark notes.
[78:42.72]Go until you die.
[78:46.77]That's just explaining what happens.
[78:48.63]That's just what happens.
[78:51.15]I mean, is that really that intelligent?
[78:53.15]I mean, maybe saying it in a different way, maybe?
[78:58.15]That's what we do as humans.
[78:59.29]You just kind of go until you don't anymore.
[79:06.30]And then you're done.
[79:07.16]That's it.
[79:18.49]Another good quote, right?
[79:20.81]What's another one I could come up with here?
[79:22.11]There's no... What's the one about time?
[79:27.84]Nothing's as strong or as patient as time.
[79:30.72]Put that one down too.
[79:34.92]No man is as strong or as patient as time.
[79:37.71]Get that one off the list of the Brainiac.com.
[79:40.03]The Brainiac.com list.
[79:46.05]Go until you lose.
[79:48.07]You've got only one chance.
[79:55.19]What am I doing here?
[79:55.93]Why am I on like a grilled cheese panini press?
[79:59.71]That was a funny one.
[80:01.71]Oops.
[80:05.10]What is this, a video game, or are we in a waffle maker?
[80:16.29]Oh, come on, fuck, that's it, I lose.
[80:19.83]No, no, I can keep going.
[80:29.62]I'm gonna lose here.
[80:30.32]This is when I, like, die in the game.
[80:34.40]All these A-coins.
[80:37.76]I want these in my portfolio.
[80:39.00]No, I'm not making a crypto joke.
[80:40.46]Don't do it.
[80:41.00]I already did.
[80:44.77]Don't do it.
[80:45.91]Don't do it.
[80:46.49]Am I tiny?
[80:48.41]I feel like I'm, like, five inches tall.
[80:51.49]In the game.
[80:52.23]In the game.
[80:53.87]And I always jump on the roulette tables.
[80:55.59]What the fuck is this?
[81:00.74]You can't judge that.
[81:01.68]You're not gonna judge that jump.
[81:03.44]Good luck.
[81:06.78]What?
[81:09.20]This is supposed to be me?
[81:40.19]I don't know what this is, but this has potential, so we're gonna try it.
[81:47.09]Oh yeah, this one, this looks good.
[81:49.33]Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[81:51.93]Would you like to know some of the things on the back of this one?
[81:54.01]Blue screen incoming.
[81:58.56]One of the, remember, this is the back.
[82:01.42]of the case.
[82:02.50]And you always want to put your best foot forward.
[82:04.82]You want to tell everybody why, because, I mean, this is the only real estate you've got.
[82:08.26]Back in the day, there was no such things as online reviews.
[82:14.39]There wasn't such thing as, make sure you go check out all these people that are talking about the game.
[82:19.37]Nope.
[82:20.81]There was the back of the fucking box in the manual to tell you if the game was any good.
[82:25.67]Here is one of the four things that's on the back of this manual.
[82:28.71]Back of the box.
[82:31.95]Camera angles move as fast as you do.
[82:36.39]One of four selling points.
[82:47.70]Magazine, game magazines.
[82:49.12]Yeah, but game magazines would, they review games like two months after the fact.
[82:53.28]A game would come out and it would be on the cover and it would be, there was only like 10, there was like six to 10 reviews per magazine.
[83:02.08]30 games came out every month for PlayStation 1 and 64.
[83:05.19]They picked and chose which games they were going to review.
[83:09.83]So a game like this would just fall right through the cracks.
[83:11.41]They didn't review this game.
[83:12.63]Nobody reviewed this game.
[83:15.55]I am certain of this.
[83:18.37]Why would you put this in your publication 25 years ago?
[83:23.73]Not this one.
[83:29.43]This is called Perfect Weapon.
[83:36.48]Can we play a good game?
[83:37.78]I have good games for PlayStation 1, don't you worry.
[83:41.94]Perfect Weapon is a trademark, who cares?
[83:49.38]I wanna save the good ones though.
[83:52.48]For instance, you don't think I got Dino Crisis in here?
[83:55.65]Spoiler.
[83:59.25]Sound controller, yeah that's fine.
[84:03.77]Adventure, new game.
[84:14.94]This doesn't look perfect.
[84:16.24]No, it does not.
[84:18.48]Now we have a reverse loading screen.
[84:22.86]Please give us one more.
[84:23.80]Oh my god, yes!
[84:25.52]They've given us a loading screen like an old-school boss's health bar!
[84:29.43]One more!
[84:30.55]Ah, of course there's a yellow one!
[84:31.73]The yellow one means you're... The yellow one means you're almost done!
[84:34.19]Alright, is this just... Is this gonna be done?
[84:49.04]Here we go.
[84:58.34]Cut scene.
[85:00.87]Perfect weapon.
[85:02.07]Why is he not dressed as a boxer?
[85:11.39]He's in jeans.
[85:13.95]Baseball team.
[85:15.21]Why would you not be in shorts and a
[85:27.22]Mega Man, we got- What?
[85:29.20]So am I. Well, that shut him up.
[85:56.90]Oh no, it's... Oh no.
[85:59.12]I'm going to give you a reference here and you're going to know exactly what I'm talking about right when I say it.
[86:06.75]Resident Evil 1 controls.
[86:11.03]That's the one.
[86:11.71]Yep, the Resident fucking Evil controls.
[86:15.93]And they are even worse than Resident Evil 1 controls.
[86:20.92]God damn it.
[86:25.15]What is going on?
[86:25.93]Walk across this!
[86:29.95]Tank controls?
[86:34.35]What do you mean, no way?
[86:38.43]What am I- is there- is there a lizard over here?
[86:40.17]It even does the camera angle switches.
[86:44.86]Alright, so there's a lizard- there's a dead lizard over here.
[86:51.08]What the fuck am I doing?
[86:55.10]I jumped over that guy.
[87:03.99]What a great camera angle you're showing me.
[87:07.45]What a selling point.
[87:15.33]Can I jump to the rocks?
[87:22.29]Alright, what was the jump?
[87:45.31]Can I get out of here?
[87:52.67]How do I leave?
[87:53.66]I don't want to do... I want to get out of here.
[87:59.26]Leave the area.
[88:00.64]Leave the zone.
[88:06.64]I don't know what to do.
[88:10.48]You would think it would be investigate the body or something, but... Okay, I can crouch.
[88:19.97]Run and jump?
[88:20.55]I don't even know how I did that before.
[88:23.21]How do you run?
[88:24.11]Okay, and what's jump?
[88:32.98]No, that's not jump.
[88:39.01]I don't... Eat him?
[88:44.64]I don't think I can eat him.
[88:50.36]Has anybody ever played this game?
[88:51.90]It has to be Jump.
[88:56.63]I think so, right?
[88:57.33]You'd assume.
[89:00.03]He keeps saying...
[89:07.87]Well, this is how I guess I'm going to live out the rest of my life.
[89:25.86]I don't understand.
[89:26.78]I wish I knew what the fuck was happening.
[89:29.46]Every time I get to the edge here, it decides to play the dance music.
[89:35.91]I need to figure out just leave anything is there a jump is there a combination I can do no camera moves as fast as you do look at the map looks like I can go over here no that has to be something I can do that has to be
[90:06.11]How did I jump over him last time?
[90:07.29]What was the combination?
[90:08.05]Anybody remember what it was?
[90:14.31]No, why would you guys know?
[90:21.22]What is this?
[90:21.90]What am I looking at?
[90:22.92]Select?
[90:23.32]Look, it's showing me this now.
[90:29.81]And he just keeps saying, no way, I have to be able to get on these rocks.
[90:40.95]Okay, okay!
[90:44.67]He keeps saying no way, but then he doesn't.
[90:50.10]Get over there.
[90:52.78]Oh my god, please.
[90:54.56]No, no, don't go.
[90:56.04]Why is he walking across this?
[91:04.93]Um, what?
[91:11.63]Alright, I'm walking across the gap.
[91:21.82]How do I stop from jumping?
[91:34.79]Get over there!
[91:36.55]Oh my god!
[91:44.06]I did it!
[91:44.42]I made it over here!
[91:48.47]Now what do I do?
[91:50.31]Jesus!
[91:57.40]Fight!
[91:58.02]Fight!
[91:59.24]Oh my fucking god.
[92:01.10]I'm gonna lose.
[92:13.83]I don't even... Oh, there's nothing I can even say.
[92:16.41]Captain Hunter, welcome to a better world.
[92:25.64]Now that I know what to do, let me just get over there.
[92:27.74]The music was perfect.
[92:32.57]We'll give it that.
[92:42.86]I at least need to get past that first place.
[92:45.49]And then we can move on.
[92:47.83]We got a lot more in here.
[92:51.41]This one's gonna be terrible.
[92:52.45]This is a classic.
[92:53.27]We're gonna keep the classic of good games for later.
[92:57.83]What is this?
[93:01.97]Oh man, yeah.
[93:04.59]This one is a guaranteed 10 minutes.
[93:07.62]We're not that far yet.
[93:10.46]Not far yet.
[93:11.42]Venture.
[93:12.17]I know what to do now.
[93:17.09]Why can I not select anything?
[93:22.57]I'm pretty sure this is a sign.
[93:24.17]Because it will not let... Alright, moving on.
[93:27.93]Blue screen.
[93:31.95]I couldn't even press any buttons.
[93:35.59]Alright.
[93:36.91]Here we go.
[93:39.69]You can tell a game is good when it has four CDs, and this one has, uh, let's see.
[93:45.43]This game, is this game good?
[93:46.90]I don't know, this might be one of those good games that I just didn't realize was a good game until... I mean, there are, there are four discs here.
[93:59.04]No, this is not Final Fantasy VII.
[94:01.31]I'm not going to play that on PlayStation 1.
[94:04.47]Why would I play that game?
[94:10.09]Oh, Jeremiah, you're doing PlayStation 1 stuff?
[94:12.40]Final Fantasy 7!
[94:13.64]No.
[94:13.78]I'm going to give an unpopular opinion here.
[94:23.46]That game is stupid.
[94:30.66]I'm just kidding.
[94:31.26]That's one of the greatest RPG turned basic games.
[94:35.20]I should not have said that.
[94:36.16]That was a joke.
[94:36.86]Don't fucking quote me on that.
[94:38.42]That was off the record.
[94:43.11]Looks like somebody's got an opinion here.
[94:45.15]How's this fear effect?
[94:50.29]I don't know if this is any good.
[94:55.60]Stop pandering.
[94:58.12]No, pandering would be me turning on my webcam and I'm dressed like Cloud.
[95:03.33]Death.
[95:04.45]The thing we fear most.
[95:06.03]But my only fear was what would happen if I remained alive.
[95:09.70]So I ran.
[95:10.94]I knew my father would try to stop me, and I knew others would come for me.
[95:15.38]Others whose only desire was money.
[95:17.96]But my longing was stronger.
[95:19.81]This game's good, huh?
[95:21.03]So, should I not have played this one?
[95:23.61]Because we have... I'm not going to say.
[95:25.23]I'm not going to say what it is.
[95:26.77]This is one of those old... When cel-shaded was new and cool, right?
[95:49.71]Did they... Are we replaying the same cutscene?
[95:58.71]What the fuck just happened?
[95:59.99]What?
[96:00.95]That was... That was messed up.
[96:05.33]I do really like that they do the WCW, like Monday Night Nitro fire in the background with a text on it.
[96:12.63]I really like that.
[96:16.61]Like this... Just get rid of the text?
[96:19.41]Music and the stuff in the background.
[96:21.25]This is a WCW intro.
[96:25.47]Imagine somebody was talking about the World Championship coming up.
[96:33.15]I'm just pressing start.
[96:34.21]Let's go.
[96:39.19]Press start.
[96:46.16]New game.
[96:46.68]Is this a shoot game?
[96:50.83]We're gonna get another cutscene, aren't we?
[96:52.18]Is it a long-winded cutscene?
[96:53.28]I hope it's not too long-winded.
[97:01.28]Why does Jerma play video games if he hates all the good ones?
[97:04.00]What are you talking about?
[97:04.72]I don't hate all the good ones.
[97:09.86]I'm a huge fan of Super Mario 64.
[97:12.12]That's a good one.
[97:18.23]hong kong a familiar place in another time is this a futuristic hong kong all right that's cool a betrayer who worked for my father
[97:31.29]I had become a commodity that would be redeemed for cash.
[97:34.85]Super Mario 64.
[97:35.51]That's my favorite.
[97:36.39]So, you trust him?
[97:38.41]Jins are reliable.
[97:39.63]Yeah?
[97:40.25]How do you know?
[97:41.07]He helped me get all the street tiers back before he threw in with the triad.
[97:44.92]He's always got an angle, but I'd say he's a friend.
[97:47.18]When you're talking about this kind of money, you can lose friends in a hurry.
[97:50.50]And once we find the girl, we are talking about this kind of money.
[97:54.10]2000.
[97:54.26]Right, Anna?
[97:55.08]We mean lamb.
[97:55.92]That guy looks like somebody grabbed a person's head at the top and bottom and squished it down.
[98:02.48]Just crushed his head like an accordion long ways.
[98:05.90]I'm gonna call that guy accordion face.
[98:11.14]That's how I'll know who he is.
[98:18.17]And actually this looks pretty good for PlayStation 1.
[98:23.11]So much for Jin being reliable.
[98:24.89]I'll go find him.
[98:29.58]Yeah, remember, this is not some old PC game.
[98:31.72]This is PlayStation 1.
[98:32.74]Okay, we got control of the character now.
[98:39.18]It's another Resident Evil controller game.
[98:42.06]Oh, god damn it.
[98:45.65]Okay, that's how you shoot.
[98:48.03]Okay.
[98:56.79]Okay, don't run out of bullets.
[98:59.75]Oh my god.
[99:01.71]How do I pick up the phone?
[99:04.71]How do I holster the gun?
[99:07.12]Okay, now I need a... Cell phone.
[99:12.68]No, that's a gun.
[99:13.96]Is my cell phone a gun?
[99:18.75]Gone are the days of being able to know what button does what.
[99:23.67]My phone just rang.
[99:26.81]No, I want to pick up the... Pick up the cell phone.
[99:32.79]Okay.
[99:33.43]Use.
[99:33.79]How do I use this?
[99:35.59]Pulse to the gun.
[99:38.28]Okay.
[99:39.62]Now.
[99:41.08]Use cell phone.
[99:44.86]That's a gun.
[99:55.12]Let me get sprint.
[99:56.90]Fucking stupid thing.
[100:08.17]What is use?
[100:10.65]I want to use!
[100:12.25]Square!
[100:12.81]Jesus Christ!
[100:14.26]Chrono Fantasy 7 doesn't have tank controls.
[100:25.40]I like it.
[100:25.76]Alright, where am I going?
[100:32.24]I probably should holster this.
[100:44.95]I just fucking shot someone.
[100:46.81]Wait, what?
[100:55.37]Oh, god damn it.
[100:56.29]How do I take this?
[100:59.95]No.
[101:03.43]I want to put this... What are the controls?
[101:07.22]What is the controls?
[101:09.14]Take.
[101:10.96]Square was used before.
[101:16.40]Okay, take.
[101:18.85]Right?
[101:20.29]No, that's knife.
[101:36.92]Bullets.
[101:38.00]Take- Okay, it's triangle to pick something up off the ground.
[101:44.30]Is there a run?
[101:44.84]Shoot.
[101:48.16]Why do I have- Now I get the knife out.
[101:49.80]And I've been trying to put that up.
[101:58.58]No, this is not a good indication of the video game.
[102:02.27]Now I... Oh, God.
[102:07.07]This is not an indication of the game.
[102:08.27]This is me learning how to play the game.
[102:09.61]I'm going to try this again.
[102:10.81]One more try.
[102:11.37]This game... Look.
[102:14.25]This game is not a bad game.
[102:22.15]We got three more discs.
[102:24.35]Hey, uh... Excuse me.
[102:27.81]You don't think that we're gonna be... Gonna be putting these four discs into Moncho Rancho?
[102:36.92]Monster Rancher?
[102:38.24]You didn't think that I got all these discs?
[102:40.14]Because we're gonna get so many cool monsters in Monster Rancher?
[102:44.00]You know, that game works, right?
[102:45.18]Those of you Monster Rancher fans.
[102:46.64]If you put a disc in, you get a new monster.
[102:48.69]And you get as many discs as you can fucking have in your house.
[102:53.99]Okay.
[102:55.57]What is running?
[103:03.54]It's R1.
[103:03.92]Alright.
[103:04.56]We got it.
[103:04.94]We got it.
[103:05.36]We're good.
[103:11.22]If you don't know, Monster Rancher for PlayStation 1 is a game where you breed monsters, you fight monsters.
[103:17.47]It's an awesome game.
[103:18.27]The game is incredible.
[103:19.59]One of the features is you can go into the lab and put any discs.
[103:25.69]PlayStation 1, CD, DVD, doesn't matter.
[103:28.81]As long as it has data on the disc and it pulls monster DNA from the disc.
[103:34.33]Sometimes you can get a rare monster.
[103:41.11]What is the aim?
[103:42.69]Is there an aim?
[103:45.66]Maybe not.
[103:50.32]But, there's a guy... What was the guy that I shot before?
[103:53.02]Apparently he's not over here.
[103:55.54]Okay, so far so good.
[104:02.76]Take.
[104:07.28]Take a ladder.
[104:13.10]This is getting really dark.
[104:18.50]Did somebody say this is getting remastered?
[104:20.06]Oh, can't shoot him.
[104:23.89]I have to go down the ladder and then karate chop him in the head.
[104:39.04]Did I fall off the ladder, or did... What happened there?
[104:51.44]Alright, that's a good one.
[104:52.30]That's a good one.
[104:53.80]There's three more discs, but it's like, we're just going through... This game's cool, but I don't get the time to sit here and play, like, four hours.
[105:04.36]Um, this is cool.
[105:05.22]Maybe we'll go back to this one after we go through the trash can.
[105:07.62]That is some of these games.
[105:09.44]Maybe we'll just put this one in the box.
[105:11.00]We're going to put this one in the box.
[105:12.40]Blue screen coming up.
[105:13.14]We're going to put this one in the box.
[105:16.14]I'm going to hold on to this one.
[105:20.02]Plus, I'm going to get monsters from these.
[105:26.15]Sure, you won't.
[105:28.59]You never know.
[105:29.03]I might.
[105:30.41]I like that one.
[105:30.93]That one was good.
[105:34.46]Alright, what else we got in here?
[105:38.50]Dino Crisis.
[105:40.61]Oh boy, oh boy.
[105:41.81]We're saving that one for another day.
[105:44.45]Just to give you guys a little bit of a sneak peek.
[105:47.21]We're going to be playing one of my absolute favorite video games ever.
[105:52.83]Who remembers the Die Hard games in the arcade?
[105:56.13]That's coming up soon here.
[105:57.73]Not tonight.
[105:59.47]But I got the whole Die Hard trilogy here.
[106:06.19]The one with the beat-em-up game, the shooting game.
[106:08.79]Oh man, it's great.
[106:09.71]What do you mean you've seen that?
[106:16.12]It's terrible.
[106:16.90]Those die-hard arcade games and die-hard PlayStation 1 games is so good.
[106:21.82]What are you on about?
[106:22.58]This one's also... This is going to be terrible though.
[106:27.30]This one is... Okay.
[106:31.94]So this one does not have... There's no disc in here.
[106:38.77]what what are you talking why what do you mean why is there no disc in here what is what the hell what is this why is it all right we gotta talk about this because hold on a minute I I'm naked I have no clothes on give me a second I I need I need to turn on no I can't but just I gotta pee anyway so just give me a minute I
[109:16.86]Okay so what I was going to say there is this is a double CD.
[109:21.71]You know how they used to make those games where you opened up one side and there was a second side and usually had one or two discs in here.
[109:30.81]When you open up the first slot there's just a PlayStation logo and with no disc.
[109:36.85]The other side has the game in it.
[109:40.53]Why have such a huge case with a double opening?
[109:44.59]Oh it's because the manual is huge.
[109:47.90]Well, that makes sense.
[109:54.06]This one's kind of like the game we just played.
[109:55.82]This is the game we just played.
[109:58.98]Did I buy two?
[109:59.72]Did I buy this twice?
[110:00.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[110:02.36]Okay, this is different.
[110:05.47]This game is expensive, too.
[110:07.99]Why was this game this expensive?
[110:11.37]Let's get it going.
[110:16.83]Here we go.
[110:20.81]It's all the same game.
[110:21.93]No.
[110:22.17]I've done that before, though.
[110:24.29]I bought, uh... Long time ago.
[110:26.85]Remember when I did all those old PC games?
[110:29.50]Well, one of them that I bought was a game called Trader's Gate.
[110:33.52]And I bought another one.
[110:34.36]What the fuck was that?
[110:35.58]It just bounced.
[110:36.16]I bought two games that I thought looked really interesting.
[110:41.42]I could probably go get them.
[110:42.16]I don't know where they are, but... They were two different games.
[110:47.97]that inside the box of one of the games was a warning that said hey by the way this game is also this game and I got really depressed and sad germa show your your blank to prove that it isn't pre-recorded yeah let me like let me ban my twitch channel because I'm gonna like pretend
[111:16.34]All right, this game is called Fade to Black.
[111:20.34]There's an alien with a, there's a weird lizard alien man on the cover with what looks like a laser rifle.
[111:26.69]I'm excited for this one.
[111:33.23]Show us your blank.
[111:34.97]What is this, a password?
[111:36.95]Show when you make whoopee, you put blank in blank.
[111:47.86]And all the funny guys from like the 40s.
[111:48.86]A couple of funny things to go there.
[111:54.47]Hold on.
[111:56.31]I don't care.
[112:03.77]I don't get this.
[112:05.43]That was... You lost me real quick.
[112:07.93]You just really did.
[112:08.79]Skill.
[112:10.37]Hard.
[112:10.81]Easy.
[112:11.13]Medium.
[112:11.57]Sound.
[112:11.93]Controller.
[112:13.54]Caption.
[112:14.50]Turn caption on.
[112:15.34]Yeah, whatever.
[112:17.56]Hey, here's the fastest way to make somebody skip your cutscene.
[112:25.48]It's that easy.
[112:27.66]Start on level one.
[112:29.28]Please wait.
[112:37.87]Show us your shattered Rio.
[112:39.81]Wow.
[112:45.73]Nice cardboard cutout at Blockbuster for your local spy movie.
[112:52.58]Message 1.
[112:52.94]What do you mean, message 1?
[112:58.74]What is going on here?
[112:59.61]I can't control the game.
[113:06.79]Oh, come on.
[113:07.53]Really?
[113:08.77]What's wrong with this?
[113:15.82]Use, watch, no buttons do anything.
[113:17.92]I'm gonna pull the, I'm gonna unplug this.
[113:32.59]Alright, controller's out, controller's going back in.
[113:40.07]Got it!
[113:42.15]Sometimes that's all it takes.
[113:50.07]Why am I dressed like a dad?
[113:51.55]I have cigars to smoke in my study.
[113:56.95]Okay.
[114:29.34]Why am I dressed like this?
[114:37.20]Use watch.
[114:38.44]How do I use the watch?
[114:41.19]Oh, there it is.
[114:41.67]I gotta shoot that.
[114:45.61]Can I look up?
[114:53.54]No, this is not where to go.
[114:54.58]You would think I have to go through the door here, but I can't.
[115:06.28]Why does this sound so odd?
[115:07.62]Can I do anything with this?
[115:09.98]Alright, how do I put the gun down?
[115:15.46]There we go.
[115:16.02]Message 1.
[115:16.36]You actually just look at how much time has gone by.
[115:20.69]Weapon.
[115:21.05]Normal.
[115:22.15]Shield.
[115:22.61]Map.
[115:37.04]Whatever.
[115:38.58]I guess I can't do anything.
[115:43.14]Unless I can go down here somehow.
[115:44.47]Can I go in this?
[115:51.11]Maybe from the other side?
[115:52.19]This is giving me a headache.
[116:00.79]I don't know if I can play this anymore.
[116:07.67]Why is this open?
[116:08.96]What the hell was that?
[116:10.12]Oh my god, it was just open.
[116:11.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[116:16.96]I think that opens the door.
[116:17.80]Yep, I have a limited amount of time to get in here.
[116:20.34]Alright, I did it.
[116:24.42]Is he gonna hurt me?
[116:27.03]What?
[116:32.65]Am I aiming at him?
[116:34.37]How do you aim down?
[116:40.79]How do you aim down?
[116:42.28]He's confused.
[116:42.88]Ah.
[116:42.94]Oh, that's it.
[117:06.17]I can't do anything.
[117:07.07]No buttons are working anymore.
[117:13.25]In the process, I seem to have lost the front half of my forehead and eyes.
[117:17.29]Alright, that's cool.
[117:19.93]That was, um... That was a nice $15 joke right here.
[117:33.20]Uh, this is a first-person shooter.
[117:35.80]We've got two... We have two left here before we start to get into... Actually, that's not true.
[117:41.86]I have a lot more on the way.
[117:44.32]I've purchased a lot more of these and they're on the way.
[117:48.46]I'm keeping... I'm losing track of what... Okay, no.
[117:51.22]I got two here.
[117:53.96]We'll round it out.
[117:54.60]Here comes a blue screen.
[117:57.35]God damn it.
[118:06.67]That one had potential, too.
[118:10.25]This is a first-person shooter.
[118:11.81]This one looks like it could be probably a video game.
[118:20.71]We're going to return to Lightgun on Tuesday.
[118:24.00]If you're curious.
[118:31.50]Lightgun is coming back.
[118:32.82]We're going to do point blank two, point blank three.
[118:36.52]And if there's still time, which those are probably going to take a while, but if there's still time, we'll do... I have a Western... I forget the name of it.
[118:43.78]It's called something weird.
[118:44.64]But I have like three or four more light gun PS1 games.
[118:49.22]This is called Delta Force Urban Warfare.
[118:53.73]Or... A.K.A.
[118:56.77]What's the most generic title you could ever name anything?
[119:03.03]Okay.
[119:03.65]Ink.
[119:06.64]I was going to say, English or Canadian?
[119:11.36]That seems, don't we speak the same language?
[119:15.24]What, do they just add like A to everything?
[119:19.79]Come on.
[119:20.99]Come on, you thought that was funny.
[119:22.59]No, you didn't.
[119:23.31]You laughed at that one a little bit.
[119:25.53]And you might be in a room with a couple of friends, and you just muffled it real quick.
[119:28.37]You thought that was funny.
[119:43.18]Uh, this is gonna... By the way, we're not gonna play this one for very long.
[119:45.50]It's gonna give everybody a headache.
[119:47.92]This is PlayStation 1.
[119:50.38]Trash.
[119:51.60]Any movement?
[119:52.14]First-person shooter.
[119:53.76]At like 20 field of view.
[120:00.12]That's negative, John.
[120:02.17]Okay, let's go to staging positions and standby to complete.
[120:05.29]Why is this just the Rainbow Six Siege?
[120:07.47]Pretend they're real players.
[120:08.91]Audio.
[120:09.31]This is the E3 video.
[120:10.51]These are just players playing the game talking.
[120:14.90]I always knew there was a reason I was risking my life.
[120:31.01]Yeah, let's make an E3 video where we have pretend players play our game.
[120:38.15]Uh, John, how about giving us some orders?
[120:41.16]If you guys cut the yapping, I might be able to.
[120:43.84]Yeah, just like how when you're talking with your friends.
[120:46.68]Put your yapping, stupid.
[120:47.70]Alright, I'm going in.
[120:49.56]Watch your six.
[120:50.66]Yeah, sure will.
[120:52.38]I'm getting hungry.
[120:53.98]Why do they do that shit?
[120:55.94]Okay, ladies.
[120:57.20]We're getting close.
[120:58.02]See?
[120:58.62]Cut the chatter.
[120:59.39]What did I tell you?
[121:00.67]Team 2, move up.
[121:05.99]It's like a bunch of old dudes sat around a table and were like, what do these kids say around the microphones?
[121:12.37]Write it down as a script.
[121:14.12]Confirming final position.
[121:18.14]Team 3, move it up.
[121:21.28]Team 3, good to go.
[121:29.26]By the way, they always go with something like this.
[121:31.16]Oh, Booyah!
[121:35.34]No one's ever said Booyah.
[121:37.90]No one has ever said it.
[121:40.28]You've only heard the word Booyah in a scripted event.
[121:45.62]No human has ever said that on their own free will.
[121:51.38]Why do they continue to pretend like that's a human talking?
[121:59.80]What was that?
[122:03.76]What just happened?
[122:06.74]What happened?
[122:07.16]Is this the end screen?
[122:08.06]Did I lose?
[122:08.63]Okay.
[122:15.97]New game, I guess.
[122:25.33]It had been three days since my raid went sour in Colombia.
[122:28.87]I knew whatever we'd stumbled across was pretty big.
[122:31.57]I and the other two guys who'd survived had been officially listed as MIA while the brass tried to find out what the hell was going on.
[122:39.78]I didn't even begin to suspect how bad this was until I got a call from Robert.
[122:45.74]Robert Jackson was an old friend of the family.
[122:48.50]Started out as a rookie cop with my father.
[122:50.52]30 years later ended up director of the CIA.
[122:54.61]Now here I was, waiting to meet him in a downtown Chicago parking garage at 2 a.m.
[123:02.71]I thought that was his head, where his hand was.
[123:04.71]I thought it was his neck leaning out, weird cartoony.
[123:07.14]Is that you?
[123:07.66]Nice to see you again, John.
[123:10.34]Sorry it's not a more fortunate circumstance.
[123:12.48]Likewise, Bob.
[123:14.07]So, what's going on?
[123:16.19]I take it dragging me out here is connected to Columbia.
[123:19.03]And I'm afraid so.
[123:20.53]Now, off the record, that was the third Delta Force team we've lost in similar circumstances in the last two months.
[123:26.46]And this meeting means it's not just coincidence.
[123:30.18]There's someone new on the safety team.
[123:35.06]They've got terrorist groups working together who'd normally kill each other on sight.
[123:40.10]The same jittery outlines of every character.
[123:43.12]Most definitely.
[123:45.03]Hideo Konami made this game.
[123:48.81]Hideo Kojima made this game.
[123:51.21]Don't you already have a room full of people for this kind of thing?
[123:53.93]Can't use my regular people.
[123:55.69]They seem to have a line on our operations.
[123:58.04]Anticipate every attempt we've made.
[124:00.34]I've lost a lot of friends.
[124:02.72]Where do I sign up?
[124:07.68]Can I play the game?
[124:09.76]Please?
[124:13.21]You've given me two long, boring cutscenes in a row.
[124:16.79]And no actual gameplay.
[124:20.74]Now we're in Tijuana.
[124:26.77]Hideo, Hideo Konami, you make it funny because, uh, excuse me.
[124:30.71]It is Hideo Konami, because he is, he was that whole company.
[124:34.95]That company is a piece of shit now.
[124:36.64]What are they going to come up with now?
[124:37.60]What is Konami going to do now?
[124:58.62]It was Kojima and a bunch of interns.
[125:01.15]You think the interns are going to make a flawless 10 out of 10 video game?
[125:05.13]No.
[125:07.09]What do they got now?
[125:07.63]Like Castlevania?
[125:09.03]They're not going to make another Castlevania.
[125:12.99]Capcom's going to buy that franchise in like two years.
[125:17.61]Reddit.com slash remind me post slash when I said this, remind me in two years.
[125:24.98]Capcom's going to buy Castlevania from Konami.
[125:27.78]Konami's going to liquidate all their assets.
[125:29.70]Capcom buys Castlevania.
[125:35.68]Metal Gear is going to... It'll turn into... Kojima will buy Metal Gear back.
[125:43.62]What am I doing?
[125:45.63]Alright, change to PDA.
[125:47.19]PDA, whatever.
[125:48.25]Let's go.
[125:53.02]I thought this was another cutscene.
[125:54.24]This is the game.
[125:55.34]Alright.
[125:55.63]Did you see?
[126:04.25]There is extreme aim assist.
[126:07.89]I don't even have to aim the gun.
[126:10.73]That bozo's gonna come up here in a second.
[126:13.35]I need to take him out.
[126:15.03]Silently.
[126:15.43]Silently.
[126:17.01]Well, maybe you should not have brought an assault rifle.
[126:26.23]Did I get him?
[126:34.20]Again, nobody says bozo.
[126:36.92]Think of a scenario where you've ever used the word bozo.
[126:41.92]Okay, I'm going to help you guys out here.
[126:44.04]Any of you guys that want to be writers, script writers, you have to... Don't write dialogue the way that you think people talk.
[126:53.26]Looks like a comm unit.
[126:54.64]That could be useful.
[126:55.80]Write the way that you actually talk.
[126:59.92]And if you write a sentence, read it out loud.
[127:02.82]Let's say, for instance, we're going to do writing class.
[127:05.16]Writing 101.
[127:05.48]Here we go.
[127:08.41]So, let's do a dialogue sequence here, okay?
[127:11.25]I'm going to write a piece of dialogue, and you're going to see what's wrong with it.
[127:14.05]Ready?
[127:15.00]So, we've got two people going to get coffee together.
[127:18.16]And one of them wants to bring up... They're sitting across each other, you know, internally in a coffee shop.
[127:24.10]And one of them wants to bring up a recent TV show that he watched.
[127:27.90]Okay?
[127:28.44]So, here we go.
[127:29.76]Let's just start.
[127:31.12]You tell me what's wrong with this.
[127:50.73]Okay, so let's do this.
[127:52.35]Let's get this out here.
[127:58.55]Make sure you can see.
[128:03.87]So we got person A. Yo, dude, did you see the latest That 70s Show?
[128:11.16]What on earth was that?
[128:13.60]So we have something wrong here, first of all, is yo, dude, get rid of that.
[128:18.90]Nobody starts a conversation with yo dude, okay?
[128:22.56]It's just, did you see that 70s show last night?
[128:26.55]No, by the way, no last night there.
[128:28.57]That latest, that 70s show?
[128:31.71]No, did you see that 70s show last night?
[128:34.93]And what on earth was that?
[128:35.79]No, nobody talks like that.
[128:37.51]You have to get right as if you're talking to your friend.
[128:40.34]Say it out loud.
[128:41.96]Let's do it correctly.
[128:43.72]So let's keep the same idea here.
[128:47.04]This is for free, by the way.
[128:48.18]Like, this is a creative writing 101 with Professor Albertson.
[128:52.11]This is for free.
[128:52.87]Nobody has to pay me for this.
[128:54.59]Let's do it correctly now.
[129:03.01]No.
[129:04.28]Did you guys see that?
[129:05.08]Oh, not.
[129:08.58]Did you?
[129:09.20]Did they see it?
[129:10.26]No.
[129:10.52]Yeah, they did.
[129:11.18]Fuck.
[129:14.68]Okay.
[129:14.78]Okay.
[129:27.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[129:28.53]It would be... Just remember, we're looking for organic.
[129:47.52]It's got to be organic.
[130:00.30]Okay, so what we got, we have a lot of organic material coming out here.
[130:04.92]So this is the correct version of the thing that you're seeing on the screen below.
[130:08.36]So for instance, we got a lot of things going on here.
[130:13.49]That 70s show was terrible last night.
[130:15.63]You watch the Olympics or anything?
[130:17.05]Hey, your mom's here.
[130:18.82]Like the mom's coming in too.
[130:20.88]That's a part of the notes here.
[130:22.40]So as you see, that's why the bottom one's much more organic.
[130:25.97]The top one is using terminology that nobody uses.
[130:28.39]The bottom one is just straight up just answers, organic questions and answers.
[130:32.99]That's how I have conversations with my friends.
[130:37.61]The bottom one is correct.
[130:47.16]He's got a baseball outfit.
[130:48.70]Okay.
[130:51.44]Alright, we just killed Babe Ruth.
[131:03.75]No detonators are in range?
[131:05.45]What?
[131:05.63]I need a keycard.
[131:08.07]Got two clips.
[131:14.56]Somebody's coming in the door.
[131:16.88]Oh, it's the rest of the baseball team.
[131:23.85]Picked up one clip.
[131:27.54]Didn't want me to be stealthy about this.
[131:31.82]Did I not get a keycard yet?
[131:35.65]You don't have a keycard on you or anything?
[131:48.72]No, we can't next to this yet.
[131:49.76]Not yet.
[131:50.06]I need to find the keycard.
[131:55.92]That is very difficult, considering it's hard to even see the images in front of my face.
[132:01.98]It's so texturally blurred out.
[132:04.70]You think I'm gonna find a keycard like this?
[132:12.38]I got in.
[132:12.78]How did I get in here?
[132:13.78]Oh.
[132:14.69]This is the first level.
[132:21.51]Can I go there?
[132:22.03]Oh, okay.
[132:24.11]I can.
[132:25.94]Use the keycard.
[132:29.92]Guy in this door.
[132:30.60]Why am I still playing this game?
[132:39.04]I should have gave up a long time ago.
[132:50.16]Who else is here?
[132:50.86]Oh, shit.
[132:52.73]Wait, wait.
[132:53.39]Use what?
[132:53.77]What do I have to do?
[132:55.81]I have no more bullets.
[133:04.51]Oh, I just made it way worse.
[133:12.49]Alright, let's end this.
[133:14.67]We're going to close this stream out.
[133:16.03]We're going to play...
[133:19.14]The Italian Job.
[133:24.22]I can't play that game, no way.
[133:25.75]There's an ad for GTA 2 in here, which, that's a classic.
[133:29.07]Blue screen, coming up.
[133:35.57]This is not the end of PlayStation 1.
[133:38.19]We're just going through the... the... Treasure Trust of PlayStation 1 games.
[133:46.15]There are probably maybe a half dozen more PlayStation 1 games I would like to play.
[133:50.46]I'm going to go back to... Somebody gave $100.
[133:51.58]It was Ben Elnor.
[133:55.86]We'll get to the bits after this as well.
[133:57.50]But let's make sure I... Thank you, Ben Elnor, for the $100.
[134:03.19]Right now.
[134:04.57]They just say, cool milk.
[134:07.09]Cheer 10,000.
[134:08.13]10,000 bits.
[134:11.97]Incredibly, incredibly generous of you, Ben.
[134:14.70]I get- Whoa!
[134:16.34]Like, where am I- I wanna- Did you just, like, haunt me?
[134:20.56]I just said your name, and all of a sudden, I just got this feeling of an alien coming out of my throat, and I just had to burp wicked loud in my- internally.
[134:28.86]Jesus.
[134:30.52]Uh, thank you, dude.
[134:32.80]Thank you so much.
[134:33.76]Again, you give a lot of money to this stream.
[134:39.16]Thank you.
[134:40.32]Ram okay, ROM okay.
[134:42.42]This is a Rockstar?
[134:43.44]Rockstar made this game?
[134:46.36]Huh?
[134:49.63]When?
[134:53.11]When did they have time to do that?
[134:58.39]Oh, we're gonna get flagged here.
[135:00.68]We're gonna watch the trailer for the movie, The Italian Job.
[135:13.81]I feel like this is going to be good.
[135:28.42]Cars don't drive downstairs.
[135:32.04]Especially free of them.
[135:37.64]Yeah, this game has cars in it.
[135:38.98]You know it's going to be good.
[135:42.34]This is Rat Movie The Game.
[135:48.07]A Mini Cooper?
[135:48.77]Yeah.
[135:49.97]One Mini Cooper, not three.
[135:51.49]This is a little loud.
[135:53.96]Is this the Italian job, or is this Blues Traveler, the video game?
[136:02.50]Alright, we're going to London.
[136:04.59]The only thing we can do is London.
[136:15.58]Cutscene?
[136:24.54]Go back to playing Fear Effect.
[136:25.76]That game looked really cool.
[136:28.22]Yeah, look, we got at least a few of these that aren't off the table at all.
[136:32.69]Fear Effect, Dino Crisis, Die Hard.
[136:34.79]Is that Michael Caine?
[136:45.90]That's Michael Caine doing an impression of himself.
[137:02.70]I'll finish my time at Her Majesty's pleasure.
[137:05.22]And Lorna is on her way to pick me up from the prison gates.
[137:08.82]Touching scene, isn't it?
[137:10.44]It is.
[137:10.64]The problem is that silly cow has gone and borrowed the bloody Pakistani ambassador's car.
[137:16.02]I'm using an Elgato for this.
[137:17.38]I am using, if you're curious, how I'm capturing this stuff.
[137:19.88]I'm using a converter into an Elgato.
[137:29.76]So they convert, I'm using it to mini AV2HDMI.
[137:35.66]But let me actually, hold on, I'm reading it upside down, wait.
[137:39.95]The exact thing that I use for right now is a Ghana G-A-N-A mini AV2HDMI upscaler.
[137:51.57]It takes in the composite video and audio, transfers that into HDMI and it does a pretty absolutely fantastic job.
[137:59.90]Fantastique.
[138:02.60]That's what I just said.
[138:06.20]But yeah, out of any product that I've ever bought that does what it says it's supposed to do, this thing does exactly what it says it's going to do.
[138:16.43]Highly recommend it.
[138:17.19]G-A-N-A.
[138:19.11]The Mini.
[138:20.15]It works.
[138:20.53]Is that me?
[138:23.69]Oh, nice.
[138:24.43]We get a car.
[138:31.06]Why don't you marry it?
[138:32.20]How do you drive?
[138:35.30]Okay.
[138:35.98]Alright, he's driving.
[138:37.24]I'm, uh... This looks like GTA 3.
[138:41.00]This looks like the bike game we just played.
[138:43.56]Oh, I already got the cops on me.
[138:45.04]That guy's dead.
[139:01.65]Why is there cereal falling off the car?
[139:07.05]My car is made out of M&M's Candy Crunch coating.
[139:14.68]Can I step on the gas harder?
[139:25.08]Somebody just threw a newspaper out the window.
[139:33.80]So this is the old-fashioned car damage.
[139:38.46]Which way do I have to go?
[139:49.17]Change gears?
[139:49.83]What do you mean change gears?
[139:53.09]Lose the cops.
[139:56.85]Do I have to lose the cops, or can I just get in here?
[140:02.00]Oh boy, I actually have to lose the top.
[140:12.09]I have 33 seconds to do this.
[140:19.50]Go, come on, go!
[140:22.56]Nan, 404?
[140:24.83]What does that mean?
[140:27.03]Nan404D?
[140:28.66]Nan404D!
[140:30.58]Is that somebody's password?
[140:36.46]Okay.
[140:44.26]What was that trying to tell me?
[140:45.52]That's the license plate?
[140:55.47]Alright, let's go.
[141:00.97]Continue.
[141:05.34]Let's do it.
[141:09.78]Drive, drive, drive.
[141:10.72]This time don't get in a car accident.
[141:15.76]This car...
[141:21.88]Please don't hit anybody, don't run, don't do anything, don't commit any crimes in front of any cops.
[141:31.76]I know, like, the video's off-center, but, you know, I... It's the Italian job.
[141:38.23]Really want me to fix that.
[141:39.05]What did I do wrong?
[141:42.17]I didn't do anything wrong!
[141:43.65]What the fuck did I do wrong?
[141:47.48]I was driving like a regular person.
[141:50.62]I didn't do anything.
[141:51.68]It is so hard to see in front of me.
[141:58.46]I have to lose these cops.
[142:03.41]He's still behind me.
[142:04.45]How are you still behind me?
[142:10.81]That was a pretty sneaky maneuver.
[142:14.13]He's still on me.
[142:17.69]I can't unsee you now.
[142:23.27]Let's lose him around the circle.
[142:32.20]I don't know how I didn't lose him.
[142:35.12]Lose him around the circle.
[142:36.42]There we go, he's crashed.
[142:43.26]You can't still be behind me right now.
[142:44.82]There's no way you made it through here.
[142:48.69]How?
[142:53.79]I've done such a good job getting rid of you.
[142:57.33]Really?
[143:07.48]Get away from me.
[143:08.54]Can I look behind?
[143:09.30]Did I lose him?
[143:10.34]I lost him.
[143:14.88]Quickly.
[143:15.30]I only have 10 seconds remaining.
[143:16.86]Come on.
[143:20.55]Damn it!
[143:23.25]No!
[143:25.67]Oh, it's over!
[143:27.63]No, fuck!
[143:35.26]Oh.
[143:38.92]Yes, I want to use the ether.
[143:40.18]Yes, I want to use one healing potion.
[143:41.82]Final Fantasy sounds.
[143:42.86]Come on!
[143:45.16]Yes, use ether.
[143:45.94]Select cloud.
[143:48.12]The ambassador's car.
[143:51.17]This is pretty difficult.
[143:58.07]Drive on the left side of the road.
[144:01.05]Oh, that's right.
[144:01.67]I'm in a different land.
[144:03.15]I'm in a different country.
[144:05.48]I forgot about that.
[144:07.38]Those are the wrong rules.
[144:09.18]I'm driving like a goddamn Yankee.
[144:17.73]By the way, I could never drive... If I ever gonna travel, let's say I traveled to Europe.
[144:22.13]Some of you guys are from Europe.
[144:24.41]No way.
[144:26.40]Uh, I will never rent a car.
[144:27.66]I'm gonna take a taxi everywhere.
[144:31.44]What did I do wrong this time?
[144:32.70]Because I would crash.
[144:39.95]This is so stupid.
[144:41.63]The car is stolen.
[144:42.73]Oh, alright.
[144:43.39]Well, let's do what we did last time.
[144:51.40]If I ever drove in Europe, I would be scared the entire time.
[144:55.82]I would never be able to relax.
[144:57.70]Yeah!
[144:58.14]Come on to Europe!
[144:59.00]Relax!
[144:59.68]Go on vacation!
[145:00.78]That would be the most stressful trip I've ever taken in my life.
[145:06.83]I would have a constant lump in my throat the whole time I was on the road.
[145:26.51]Idiot thinks Europe equals England.
[145:29.75]Stop it!
[145:31.08]Stop it!
[145:32.14]No, I gotta do Arnold there.
[145:34.14]Stop it!
[145:34.80]No, I gotta do better than that.
[145:38.02]You gotta be forceful.
[145:41.66]You gotta have a bunch of force come out of your throat.
[145:45.35]Well... Stop it!
[145:49.23]No, not good enough.
[145:51.86]STOP IT!
[145:53.26]Okay, I'm done with that.
[145:56.74]Alright, now just slow my voice down like a hundred percent.
[146:01.01]Alright, go around in a circle.
[146:11.13]I did it!
[146:13.83]Turn!
[146:14.69]Turn!
[146:15.05]Oh my god!
[146:26.85]Oh, I hate myself.
[146:29.17]I hate myself right now.
[146:30.97]I have to beat the first mission.
[146:32.51]This game... 15-year-old me would have beat this game in no problem.
[146:40.25]I'm gonna drive a different way.
[146:47.54]I'm gonna avoid... I'm just gonna completely avoid the car.
[146:58.11]Okay.
[146:58.95]We're going this way.
[147:01.30]Nope.
[147:02.50]We're just wasting time.
[147:04.70]I don't have a map.
[147:05.54]There's no way.
[147:06.04]Actually, this might be good.
[147:07.10]Because now I'm going to go this way, and we're going to bypass the super cup that gets us every time around that corner.
[147:17.91]Am I speeding?
[147:18.51]I'm going to slow down.
[147:20.55]What's the speed limit here?
[147:21.27]Is this kilometers or is this miles per hour?
[147:24.71]It's kilometers in England, right?
[147:29.69]Stop, there's a cop right there.
[147:30.49]Alright, I'm stopped.
[147:39.16]Why's a... Why's a Pound Puppies theme song playing?
[147:43.90]We're the Pound Pound Puppies.
[147:46.70]Why do I... Why do I know that song?
[147:48.66]Why do I know that theme song?
[147:56.78]I made it.
[148:03.31]Okay, I think I'm good.
[148:10.71]It's my favorite show.
[148:11.91]I don't think I'm safe.
[148:18.83]I think that was a TV show that was on TV when I was, like, 11.
[148:24.19]Is this Pound Puppy still on TV?
[148:33.03]Okay, I gotta step on this.
[148:40.36]Okay, please, don't let me lose this.
[148:44.20]See?
[148:49.63]I'm sorry, we have to do this right now.
[149:02.01]Give me a second.
[149:04.09]I need to hear this.
[149:13.77]Okay, can you guys hear it?
[149:18.29]No, we got like fucking ads.
[149:24.21]I need to know this.
[149:29.07]Here it comes.
[149:34.93]Right?
[149:37.39]Okay.
[149:41.14]Right?
[149:45.78]Here it comes.
[150:03.22]Exact same song.
[150:06.01]This is a chicken or an egg scenario.
[150:08.31]I'm not sure which one.
[150:08.93]What do you mean you can't hear it?
[150:14.83]That was loud as fuck.
[150:19.56]What do you mean it was muted?
[150:20.48]No, it was not muted.
[150:22.32]Literally nothing played.
[150:23.38]What are you talking about?
[150:24.24]I saw it play on OBS.
[150:28.32]What?
[150:28.60]I just watched it play on OBS.
[150:39.46]Do I actually have to play that song again?
[150:44.46]No, there's no sound.
[150:45.76]I don't believe you.
[151:00.81]You don't hear this.
[151:15.54]You don't hear this.
[151:23.25]Shut the fuck up.
[151:24.29]I don't believe you.
[151:25.49]That's not possible.
[151:26.71]I'm watching.
[151:27.81]We hear your headphones.
[151:30.24]Oh, my God.
[151:31.16]All right.
[151:31.46]Well, hold on a second.
[151:32.40]I'm going to hold my headphone up to the microphone.
[151:38.04]Here we go.
[151:47.11]Here's Cooler, Whopper, Nose Marie, Bright Eyes, and Owler.
[152:15.58]There you go.
[152:16.12]Wait, am I actually getting, like, just fucking trolled right now?
[152:28.54]It is the same song, I know.
[152:30.72]I want to make sure you guys understood that.
[152:34.84]Alright, let's go back to play our video game.
[152:37.48]What was I doing in this game?
[152:38.96]Hold on, I can't hear anything.
[152:42.77]You didn't hear it on stream.
[152:49.21]Well, whatever.
[152:49.61]You still heard it there.
[152:55.90]I have to get there in 10 seconds.
[152:57.82]Where is it?
[152:58.48]Oh my god.
[152:59.35]Don't even fucking tell me I didn't do it again.
[153:22.73]Alright, this is... Here it comes.
[153:24.69]This song is the only thing that matters.
[153:27.52]Quality song time, let me hear it.
[153:31.74]I can't even... No, I just clicked an add.
[153:34.36]No, fuck it.
[153:35.36]I'll watch it later.
[153:36.06]I need to beat this first level and I'm going to bed.
[153:41.01]Go, get in here.
[153:41.77]I'm doing this as fast as I can.
[153:43.31]Beat the level, for Christ's sake.
[153:50.85]Cop is right here.
[153:55.83]How do I do this legally?
[153:59.43]Don't drive on the sidewalk.
[154:00.41]That's illegal.
[154:03.69]I think it's a speed thing.
[154:04.55]I really do.
[154:04.99]Because that cop is right here.
[154:07.00]It's a speed thing.
[154:07.68]I have to go like 10 miles per hour by him.
[154:10.44]See?
[154:15.58]Now, step on it.
[154:29.58]I fucking found puppies.
[154:31.04]I can't get over it.
[154:43.95]Slow down, there might be a cop right here.
[154:51.20]Fuck.
[154:53.64]Alright, I'm good.
[154:56.08]It's right here.
[155:00.43]I finally just beat the first level.
[155:11.09]We're good.
[155:11.69]I did miss you, Charlie.
[155:16.32]Let's just get the hell out of here, shall we?
[155:18.58]I just have to turn the car in, now I get out.
[155:25.71]What song is that?
[155:29.21]That's another cartoon.
[155:33.78]Austin Powers.
[155:38.98]What the fuck is the resolution on this?
[155:40.30]This looks like an original DS game.
[155:42.02]Well, you forget how old this is, you know?
[155:54.49]We have clean audio here.
[156:02.07]This is as perfectly clean as we can get it.
[156:05.98]I would like you guys to start... Meet Camp Freddy.
[156:22.44]The thing about a foreign job like this is that unless you've got plenty of money, you've had it.
[156:28.26]Now, Bridger's got plenty.
[156:30.09]But if I'm going to get my hands on it, I've got to impress him.
[156:34.27]Now, that's where Freddy comes in.
[156:36.25]Or Camp Freddy, as it's known.
[156:37.65]On account of not having to worry about your bird running off with him.
[156:41.69]Freddy!
[156:41.99]Come on, Freddy!
[156:43.02]Come on, pig!
[156:43.66]Freddy!
[156:43.98]Fred!
[156:44.16]Pew!
[156:44.34]Pew!
[156:44.54]Freddy!
[156:44.90]That is from my favorite YouTube video that's on the website.
[157:13.97]If you don't know what my favorite YouTube video is, then excuse me.
[157:17.06]I'm sorry you don't know what that is.
[157:25.80]That's from the Iowa Hog Calling Competition.
[157:27.72]That's my favorite video on YouTube.
[157:33.56]Now, my second favorite video is Stand vs. Stand.
[157:37.75]English vs. American accent.
[157:39.09]That's my second favorite video on the whole site.
[157:42.11]Look it up.
[157:42.53]You'll see.
[157:49.59]Remember the time mission here?
[157:54.70]Who cares?
[157:56.86]I do.
[158:00.70]This is just like... This is an old, like, country version of the Pound Puppies song.
[158:07.60]This is when they had that crossover episode.
[158:19.45]You don't have any time at all to do these missions.
[158:26.78]Frey!
[158:28.00]Frey!
[158:37.77]I can't even enjoy this scenery.
[158:43.43]Do cars explode in this game?
[158:53.85]Ow.
[158:57.11]Why is he wearing a corn on the cob on his head?
[158:58.99]Because it- he's at an Iowa State hog-calling competition.
[159:05.51]I have six seconds to get here.
[159:09.83]Right there, just slide!
[159:12.37]Get there!
[159:12.73]Alright.
[159:16.01]Freddy!
[159:21.69]Show the video on stream.
[159:23.27]No, I will annoy so many people.
[159:25.35]I don't understand how many people would be extremely upset if I blast that video on stream.
[159:33.26]And apparently I can't because OBS says you guys can hear the things that I play through my computer.
[159:38.12]But maybe it's the... It must have something to do with the fact that I have the PS1 hooked up.
[159:42.98]And it's just screwing it all up.
[159:50.40]Stand versus stand.
[159:51.48]That's the second best video.
[159:53.78]Second best, like, piece of comedy on YouTube.
[159:56.18]Hands down.
[159:58.76]All right.
[160:00.54]I kind of want to... I think I'm done.
[160:09.10]What's stand versus stand?
[160:10.32]Type it in.
[160:10.82]Stand versus stand.
[160:12.04]Accent.
[160:14.10]It's great.
[160:16.75]Stand.
[160:18.82]Stand.
[160:20.74]That's the whole video.
[160:21.86]I just did it.
[160:28.23]I'm not kidding.
[160:28.81]That's actually the whole video.
[160:42.33]Why does it take so long to do this?
[160:44.25]What if you can't find it?
[160:45.33]I'll link you.
[160:45.75]Hold on.
[160:59.29]Here it is.
[161:04.96]Oh, fuck.
[161:05.54]Hold on.
[161:05.94]Here it is.
[161:07.32]Here's the clip.
[161:09.96]Hold on.
[161:10.42]I need to pause this game.
[161:12.12]This is important.
[161:12.89]This is it.
[161:13.61]It's called American Accents Are Sexy.
[161:19.67]Go ahead and give that a watch.
[161:20.71]It's seven seconds.
[161:39.18]Right?
[161:41.83]Stand.
[161:45.29]The British one sounds so great.
[161:46.61]It's like stand.
[161:49.53]Stand.
[161:51.15]The second one sounds like Roger from American Dad.
[161:53.63]It's like boo and then Roger from American Dad.
[162:05.07]I'm kind of sick of playing the game where you do the same thing over and over again.
[162:09.21]Now I'll do the hog video.
[162:10.60]That's an easy search.
[162:17.34]Let's just see what happens.
[162:18.68]Apparently that's it.
[162:22.30]That's what happens.
[162:26.27]How did I end up watching this?
[162:27.43]I don't know.
[162:28.25]How do you end up watching any video that you stumble across on YouTube?
[162:32.01]Reddit?
[162:34.03]Somebody shared it with you?
[162:36.58]Newspaper all those links that you can go the hyperlinks in the newspapers You copy and paste you actually have to like cut it out and put it in a fax machine and scan it in a printer Now you get one of those all-in-ones you scan the link from the newspaper All right, that's it I'm done with like this batch of PlayStation 1 I
[163:06.93]The only other ones that we could... I don't want to tap into these yet.
[163:12.21]Because these are classics that need to be... Each one of these needs at least an hour of time.
[163:17.97]At least.
[163:19.43]Maybe more than that.
[163:25.27]I mean, how good is Dino Crisis really, though?
[163:27.37]You know what I mean?
[163:36.89]Like, PlayStation 1.
[163:40.45]Obviously, Light Gun.
[163:41.21]That's all set up back here.
[163:43.57]Which, that's the reason why I even did this in the first place.
[163:46.69]Is for the Light Gun games.
[163:47.97]So this was kind of just, I bought a bunch of extra dumb shit.
[163:54.58]It is not Dino Week, no.
[163:59.74]Guys, I just proposed to my girlfriend.
[164:00.96]She said yes.
[164:01.58]Oh, nice.
[164:01.74]Congratulations.
[164:02.58]Congratulations.
[164:06.32]But that's gonna be it.
[164:07.66]I wanted to see I was hoping we could go for like maybe at least two three hours tonight to get through some of these Tomorrow Tomorrow is Tomorrow's Monday
[164:23.83]I think I'm gonna probably have to go to my mother's tomorrow.
[164:29.37]If you don't know, just an update on that situation.
[164:32.92]My mother had surgery and had to be kind of around for a little while.
[164:38.78]So depending on how that goes, Monday and Tuesday is kind of gonna be really up in the air and juggled around a little bit.
[164:45.13]But...
[164:46.76]The next thing that you'll see, we're going to play Point Blank 2, Point Blank 3.
[164:51.73]That'll be the light gun portion of PlayStation 1.
[164:56.81]What other PlayStation 1 stuff do I want to get through for this week?
[165:01.42]Kingdom Come Deliverance is out, and I've heard I should absolutely play it.
[165:05.71]There's a handful of games that have come out that I want to play that have nothing to do with PlayStation 1.
[165:10.85]But Light Gun, top priority, Point Blank 2, 3, this Western game, and this other like terrible game.
[165:17.46]And I forget the name of what it is because it's so bad that I forgot the name of it.
[165:22.30]I think I bought a Buzz Lightyear game, too.
[165:24.86]Somehow.
[165:25.34]I don't know how it happened, but I think it did.
[165:27.45]I thought it was a light gun game, and it's just not.
[165:29.57]So expect Buzz Lightyear coming up for like 25 seconds of your time during one of these streams.
[165:40.44]But take care, everybody.
[165:42.76]Thank you for sticking around for this Baker's Dozen PlayStation 1 games that I bought that all of them were terrible.
[165:52.88]Was there one that was worth playing?
[165:53.76]There was maybe like two or three in here that were actually worth playing.
[166:00.51]But let's get to the bits.
[166:03.01]Thank you so much.
[166:03.67]Take care, guys.
[166:05.79]Let's start back here.
[166:08.90]Let's put on a different screen here.
[166:18.02]Bring back the what?
[166:19.58]Bring back the Buzz Lightyear.
[166:21.86]Spider was a masterpiece.
[166:22.92]Yeah.
[166:25.39]Oh, combined value of the collection.
[166:26.89]Yes, that's a good idea.
[166:28.07]Let's talk about how... Let's see.
[166:29.71]We have... 20... 40... 50...
[166:38.88]60, 70, 80.
[166:39.06]90.
[166:39.12]100.
[166:39.14]110.
[166:39.16]120.
[166:39.18]30, 140.
[166:39.22]150, 160.
[166:39.32]$170 for these games.
[166:40.02]Wow.
[166:42.83]I actually, I'm mad that I counted this.
[167:11.60]gonna be in the red for a few weeks.
[167:17.70]Our tax dollars went to this.
[167:21.00]Yeah, but remember, this is important.
[167:24.36]Point blank.
[167:25.57]Remember, point blank one, two, and three.
[167:28.67]We already played point blank one.
[167:29.95]And what a fucking masterpiece, right?
[167:33.71]This would be worth it.
[167:40.00]it's all right don't worry but yeah we're gonna pretend I didn't say that thank you to super seal for the one dollar I'll farm bits for you until the day I die and beyond thanks man unnecessary but thank you kriegos kriegos 078 thanks for the one dollar put in the stream dentures gramps
[168:10.88]um you know you know all of my teeth are fake I don't have any real teeth I went like when I was 17 I I froze a charleston chew in the freezer and this it's absolutely delicious when you do that but I took it out unwrapped it and put it long ways and just cartoon bit down and all my teeth broke so I mean all of my teeth aren't real
[168:39.74]Thank you to Alexis1301 for the $10.
[168:44.28]Hey Jeremy, you dingus.
[168:45.42]Just wanted to say that you're one of the most genuine guys on the internet and you never fail to make me laugh.
[168:50.26]With a heart.
[168:50.70]Thank you.
[168:51.88]Alexis1301 for the $10.
[168:54.58]Appreciate it.
[168:57.63]That's a very nice thing to say.
[169:00.92]Hopefully I can continue to be a genuine person.
[169:03.84]Otherwise, I would be probably pretty upset with myself.
[169:06.80]What's my favorite mobile game?
[169:07.90]The Room.
[169:08.73]Oh, don't even get me started.
[169:09.93]The Room.
[169:10.67]The Room 2.
[169:11.45]The Room 3.
[169:12.09]The Room Original Sins.
[169:13.81]Oh boy, if you want a mobile game that is a fucking wonderful experience, please God, go play The Room.
[169:20.29]I will shill that to the end of time.
[169:23.74]If you have an iPad or you have a big enough phone where you can actually see, go download The Room and play the whole series.
[169:31.41]You will thank me later.
[169:33.45]You will come- You will play through that whole series and come back next stream and be like, holy shit, dude, thank you.
[169:42.32]No, not the Tommy Wiseau movie.
[169:47.27]The Room Original Sins just came out.
[169:48.88]It's the newest one that they made.
[169:49.94]And they're going to keep making them.
[169:50.76]It's going to be the Madden of room games.
[169:53.04]And I'm glad.
[169:54.16]Because they're always just super relaxing and super fun.
[169:56.68]Play it, please.
[170:01.32]Final Fantasy VII is stupid.
[170:02.83]I didn't say that.
[170:05.16]I was being a character.
[170:06.82]I was being a character.
[170:08.54]Right?
[170:09.62]Anytime you want to defend yourself, I was being a character.
[170:13.42]Whoa, dude, you said Ocarina of Time was terrible.
[170:16.38]I was being a character.
[170:17.72]It was a performance.
[170:20.55]But thanks to E-Work for the $1.
[170:25.41]Any chance you'll be playing Medal of Honor Original or Underground on this PlayStation 1?
[170:30.31]You know, there's... There is...
[170:34.63]I always wanted to have an opportunity to play a bunch of old games.
[170:40.31]Emulation just sucks.
[170:42.07]It just does.
[170:43.59]It can be really buggy and annoying to set up and there can be all kinds of problems with certain games.
[170:48.11]Some emulators don't work with certain games.
[170:51.09]But actually having real access now and capturable access, I can actually pull it through into OBS.
[170:58.55]I mean, I have every system now.
[171:01.51]I have Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 1, Sega CD, Genesis.
[171:08.07]At this point, anything is on the table.
[171:12.23]So whether that's... Eventually, I would like to play some old classic games that we can pull through here and not... I mean, obviously, tonight was just kind of a joke, right?
[171:22.44]We do this sometimes from time to time.
[171:24.16]We just play like a dozen shitty games in a row.
[171:28.82]But the main purpose for this PlayStation 1 was the light gun stuff, and it still is.
[171:34.08]Just wanted to get some of these out of the way.
[171:35.62]And there are other systems too, but the problem with a system like Neo Geo and Jaguar is those systems are really old and they're really rare and they're really expensive.
[171:45.95]I mean, somebody correct me if I'm wrong here, but for me to like actually buy a Jaguar in all the games, it would probably be a huge check for that.
[172:00.54]N64 is another one eventually.
[172:02.13]I mean, there's just a whole lot of old content that's worth seeing, you know?
[172:10.19]But yes, I am... What ever happened to Dreamcast Week?
[172:16.04]It's right there.
[172:17.32]It's in a box right here.
[172:20.57]And Dreamcast week, there's a lot of games.
[172:23.73]I got a lot of things here.
[172:25.63]We're going to go baby steps and one step at a time.
[172:27.59]Because remember, I still have a gigantic grandma TV behind me that needs to be played with all the light gun stuff.
[172:35.36]There's a big Dreamcast box right here.
[172:37.86]I just hopefully I don't step in it like a Christmas present.
[172:42.02]And walk around like Chevy Chase does in all his funny Christmas movies.
[172:49.61]But thank you.
[172:51.70]for your $1 e-word, twert, e-word, twert.
[172:55.47]Uh, ViCV, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[172:57.83]Appreciate that.
[172:58.41]$10, 1000 bits.
[173:00.77]Seaman, yes, we're playing Seaman.
[173:03.03]Don't worry.
[173:05.81]A game, one of the original stupid talk-to-a-robot games.
[173:09.05]You don't think I'm gonna play that on stream?
[173:11.82]Guess again.
[173:14.82]Still no Vive.
[173:19.18]Uh, thank you to TechnoToast.
[173:21.41]For the 25 cents.
[173:22.43]Jeremy, if you think that mission was impossible, just wait until you get to Siberia.

[173:51.47]It's going good.
[173:52.05]Thank you for the 15 bucks I appreciate it Saw does funny things for the 10 bucks.
[174:10.95]I have your t-have you have your $10 back Wait, oh, well, what are these games?
[174:19.77]I get it.
[174:20.09]Yeah
[174:25.76]like a lot of these it's weird because old games are they're expensive still like you know they're like 10 20 bucks some of these games cost especially if you buy them through like amazon holy the bill can rack up real fast
[174:50.65]Hey, anyone know how to fix 2,000 network error?
[174:53.83]Somebody help that guy.
[174:55.69]He's in need of help.
[174:59.82]How large is my house?
[175:01.02]Why do you want to know that?
[175:03.32]Hey, how big is your house?
[175:04.42]I don't have a big house.
[175:08.12]I live in one of those tiny houses that you see on TV.
[175:11.82]$10 is pretty reasonable.
[175:12.96]Yeah, but I mean, like, once you get, like, 20, 30 bucks for some of these old games, and you... It's just like, damn.
[175:18.87]Damn.
[175:20.29]They don't make them anymore.
[175:21.25]Oh, yeah, I totally get it.
[175:23.51]But... It's just... You could rack up a bill, especially considering that emulation exists.
[175:32.10]And damn... Damn if I don't look at some of these things sometimes and go, Yeah, I could have probably emulated that for the 45 seconds I was in the game for, you know?
[175:43.59]But...
[175:45.77]Nah, it's still nice to own them.
[175:47.79]I like actually having the physical copies.
[175:50.73]Putting the disc in.
[175:52.60]Having the controller in your hand and not having to worry about getting like a third party controller or something to get it to work.
[176:02.50]But, thank you though.
[176:03.76]Thank you for the 10 bucks sawdust bunnies.
[176:07.31]Sawdust bunnies, again, thanks for the 2 bucks.
[176:10.53]VCV, again, thanks for $10.
[176:12.45]Here's the fastest way to lose $10.
[176:14.17]Well, I just gained 20.
[176:18.26]Thank you, CV.
[176:19.32]Appreciate it.
[176:22.12]For the 10 bucks.
[176:22.98]Thank you to Seagull, or no, sorry, Surgilbutt for the $1.
[176:27.92]Don't play in the street, kids.
[176:29.45]Do not.
[176:30.79]It's incredibly dangerous.
[176:33.65]You will find yourself potentially getting run over.
[176:36.57]Don't do it.
[176:39.03]You saw that PlayStation 1 consoles are like 30 bucks a use.
[176:42.19]Are they worth it?
[176:42.93]Yeah.
[176:44.79]If you can get your hands on it, and you know that it's in working order, because some of these old PlayStations, if you buy them, eh, they might be a little on the wonky side.
[176:56.18]But the one I'm using, I'm using a P, it's the PS1, the P-Sone.
[177:01.40]When they made that new tiny one, it's a little, little box.
[177:05.54]It's just barely big enough for the disc to be there, and the power button and the tray to open.
[177:10.88]It's very small.
[177:14.03]It's the P-Zone.
[177:15.63]PS1.
[177:16.77]I know, I called it a P-Zone.
[177:18.13]Sorry.
[177:21.36]Never say it like that.
[177:22.08]Why can't it be a P-Zone?
[177:25.84]It's the P-Zone.
[177:31.18]Thank you to Abraxas5 for the $1.
[177:33.17]Whoop.
[177:33.87]Thanks, man.
[177:37.63]Void Space, thank you for the $1.
[177:39.88]Watching German streams and seeing the chat for new people must be like seeing the room with a live audience for the first time.
[177:48.04]Speaking of the room, make sure you go get it on the App Store.
[177:49.78]It's good.
[177:55.68]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[177:59.76]Out of the YSA and into the JEC stream.
[178:04.54]What is YSA?
[178:09.64]I don't know.
[178:12.20]It's like the YMCA?
[178:14.00]I don't know what that means.
[178:18.68]Thanks, Finn, for the $1, though.
[178:20.01]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[178:21.25]In quotes, Jerma says shit about chat's favorite games to rile them up part 300,000.
[178:28.25]Thank you, Darkstar.
[178:36.13]You know, we do that sometimes.
[178:38.65]KXZ501, thanks for the $5.
[178:39.95]Final Fantasy VII sucks.
[178:41.57]Jerma9852018.
[178:42.73]I mean, I did say it, but it was a joke.
[178:44.41]It was not real.
[178:46.95]It was just a joke.
[178:48.01]See?
[178:48.37]That person is also referencing that.
[178:50.01]It was just a jokey.
[178:52.67]Don't take it seriously.
[178:53.45]It's not real.
[178:57.50]Nightfang, thanks for the $1.
[178:58.80]Jerma's most uttered phrase.
[179:00.68]What are you talking about?
[179:05.27]do say that a lot because I don't know what you guys are ever talking about I'm so gullible and I'm so easy to like make say something or do something I just like what are you guys even talking about I'm old I'm like 30 I'm 37. I'm an old I'm 38 years old this coming june that's really really really old
[179:36.00]Thank you to, uh... Yeah, listen, you know, this is a very, very basic tactic I'm using here on you guys.
[179:47.03]Say you're really old, super old, crazy old, so then when people actually find out your real age, they go, oh, okay, that's not that bad.
[179:55.96]All right, yeah, you're saying like 38, like 40.
[179:58.22]That's funny.
[179:59.96]He's like way younger than that.
[180:01.64]He's a funny guy, and he's young, too.
[180:03.52]Handsome.
[180:05.15]That's the strategy I'm using.
[180:10.15]Yeah, 345, thanks for the $1.
[180:13.59]Derma confirmed reptilian pretending to be human.
[180:16.05]What a bozo.
[180:21.73]Okay.
[180:24.85]You know, I actually, I got accused of being a reptilian like seven years ago.
[180:32.89]I didn't even know what it meant and I looked it up
[180:36.33]And this is the whole thing people think that people are reptiles and human skin, right?
[180:41.17]How does that work?
[180:44.44]That doesn't make any sense.
[180:48.12]I got accused of being a reptilian and they were angry.
[180:50.74]They were very, very angry with me and they were calling me out like crazy.
[180:54.67]It's like, dude, have you guys ever worn a Halloween mask before?
[181:00.93]It doesn't matter how good that skin is or that latex is.
[181:05.14]You're in a Halloween costume.
[181:06.68]You're in a Halloween mask.
[181:09.16]If there were reptiles in human skin, they would just look like they were wearing goofy president's masks.
[181:16.71]And you would see them from a mile away.
[181:17.81]You'd be like, that dude's wearing a fucking mask.
[181:19.37]That's what a reptilian would say.
[181:29.09]Denying being a reptile exactly what a reptile would do.
[181:32.52]Why is it a reptile?
[181:33.28]Why is it reptiles?
[181:34.54]That's what I don't get though.
[181:37.24]Why are reptiles the smartest animal?
[181:39.84]You've seen an iguana in one of those cages?
[181:41.76]They're fucking morons.
[181:45.11]They just stand there and lick their faces all day under a heat lamp.
[181:52.15]Why is that the most intelligent creature in the galaxy?
[182:02.92]It's a cover.
[182:07.32]Reptiles aren't that smart.
[182:09.76]I could see if you could make up, like, your... Like, some... Oh, the sentient beings.
[182:15.70]Maybe a... I don't know.
[182:16.63]Maybe, like, a bird.
[182:18.59]Some birds.
[182:20.93]Probably.
[182:27.47]Reptiles can shed their skin.
[182:29.55]So can a...
[182:32.11]Some kind of lobster.
[182:34.73]That's what a crab does.
[182:37.66]So are we basing if reptilians exist because they can shed their skin?
[182:41.36]Well then watch out for the fucking crabs.
[182:43.02]Watch out for the snails.
[182:44.04]Why is it a snail race that's taking over the world?
[182:52.83]Spiders do that too.
[182:54.65]Tarantulas like shed their whole bodies and then go into a new tarantula shell.
[183:03.04]Almost admitted.
[183:03.78]He can shed his own skin.
[183:08.15]Lobster's molt.
[183:09.21]Yeah, that's shedding your skin.
[183:12.79]Hey, you shed too.
[183:14.05]Don't you know that?
[183:14.75]Don't you guys know you shed too?
[183:18.05]How many times have you seen like the dead skin on your fingers that you peel off?
[183:21.52]Your dog sheds.
[183:24.16]Your dog molts his hair off.
[183:26.48]Is he some overlord?
[183:29.12]No, he's probably chewing a bone right now.
[183:33.27]The only reason why people say that is because in the Bible, a snake made Eve eat that apple.
[183:41.68]And that's why, holy shit, the snake is Satan.
[183:44.12]Snake is a smart, intelligent creature.
[183:45.74]Reptile, therefore reptiles control the universe.
[183:53.77]You shed your entire skin in like seven years.
[183:55.95]Exactly.
[183:56.41]So we mold our skin.
[184:09.12]That sounds like a YouTube comment.
[184:19.65]That's my... That takes the cake for like... That's like my favorite thing I've seen in chat.
[184:25.55]That reads like a YouTube comment.
[184:30.85]And you know that that comment would have like 150 votes on it, right?
[184:35.02]It would absolutely...
[184:39.98]That was great.
[184:42.36]You're a little too adamant about this.
[184:48.01]You know how people get their tongues split?
[184:51.36]What's going on there?
[184:53.65]People get their tongue split as like cosmetic.
[184:56.41]Look at me.
[184:56.77]I got my tongue split.
[184:57.65]I'm a snake person.
[184:58.59]That's the people that you need to be watching.
[185:00.07]You know what I'm saying?
[185:01.11]Like not me.
[185:02.33]Everyone's like, oh, Jerma, you must be a reptilian.
[185:04.73]What about the person that actually makes their tongue a reptile tongue?
[185:07.50]Should we be careful about that person?
[185:09.18]Why is it me?
[185:10.10]I'm just sitting here talking to you.
[185:13.28]The guy that like dyes his skin green and splits his tongue is the guy you probably should be paying attention to if you think he's a reptile.
[185:23.74]Jerry Seinfeld.
[185:25.66]Oh, let's talk about that.
[185:30.28]Show us your tongue.
[185:31.16]No.
[185:31.64]I don't have to show that to you.
[185:35.84]You guys don't want to see my tongue.
[185:36.96]I have like a bright... I have a gray tongue.
[185:41.03]Like a giraffe.
[185:42.63]You don't want to see it.
[185:43.59]It's disgusting.
[185:45.41]Where the fuck were we?
[185:49.29]Ben Eleanor gave the $100 earlier.
[185:50.89]Thank you, Ben.
[185:53.47]Appreciate it, dude.
[185:56.96]100 bucks earlier, like an hour ago.
[185:59.66]You are too kind to me, Ben.
[186:00.82]Thank you.
[186:04.04]And Adam, thank you for the $1.
[186:05.05]Yo, dude, you catch that German on a 5 stream last night.
[186:08.57]What on earth was that?
[186:10.03]Your mom sucks.
[186:10.91]I'm so glad you saw that.
[186:17.01]I'm so happy that somebody got to see it.
[186:18.91]Hey, hey, Shiny.
[186:20.48]Thank you, Shiny.
[186:22.68]Shiny.
[186:24.22]I can't talk.
[186:24.90]I'm just going to say Shiny.
[186:27.24]Thank you, Shiny, for the $2.25.
[186:29.92]They just do that face.
[186:32.08]They do that... The face of the guy that used to... The hamburger face that used to be on the wrappers for McDonald's.
[186:39.33]The face that's like, yes, I'm looking at you.
[186:41.03]The lewd face with Leonard Lenny.
[186:44.75]The old McDonald's wrappers.
[186:46.91]The face that's on the McDonald's wrapper.
[186:51.65]That's what he put down here.
[186:53.71]Look, this is what I'm talking about.
[186:56.45]No, not the hamburger.
[186:57.37]Look, I'm going to give you...
[187:00.96]McDonald's wrapper.
[187:06.26]It's the old school McDonald's wrapper.
[187:14.37]Where the hell is it?
[187:15.01]Come on.
[187:17.21]It's an old McDonald's wrapper.
[187:20.41]Where is it?
[187:20.87]Where's the wrapper?
[187:24.87]Where's the guy?
[187:25.49]The face.
[187:26.15]The hamburger McDonald's face.
[187:28.07]The face that's on the hamburger wrappers.
[187:31.07]This is going to drive me crazy.
[187:32.09]Where is it?
[187:35.95]McDonald's wrapper face.
[187:39.08]I'm telling you, I'm not crazy.
[187:47.81]Am I crazy?
[187:48.81]I might be.
[187:53.51]No, what is... Was it McDonald's?
[187:55.53]It was McDonald's.
[187:59.59]I don't care how long I have to sit here for, I'm gonna find this.
[188:05.69]It look- it look kinda like a chef with like a choo-choo train outfit.
[188:08.87]He was like a conductor but he was a hamburger and his face looked like that face.
[188:24.92]Oh my god, what the hell was it?
[188:28.67]Shit.
[188:30.78]It was a big round face that was on the wrappers.
[188:33.70]Fuck me.
[188:34.24]Why is it not here?
[188:35.35]What the hell is it?
[188:50.42]There was like an old McDonald's mascot.
[188:52.26]I'm talking before Ronald McDonald.

[194:42.33]Ugh!
[194:46.43]Thank you to Mod- Not Dead Mod Kyle for the random bit of trivia.
[194:52.23]During World War II, there was a project to develop pigeon-guided missiles.
[194:55.66]It was headed by American Behaviourist B.F.
[194:59.16]Skinner.
[194:59.76]Google Project Pigeon if you don't believe me.
[195:02.10]I ain't googling any more things.
[195:05.16]I am done googling for the day.
[195:07.64]I am not typing in anything ever again.
[195:11.32]into Google.

[197:12.61]Hey, Jerm, a quick question.
[197:13.43]Have you gotten around to watching JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
[197:15.59]It's been like two years since you said you were.
[197:18.48]We demand answers.
[197:19.32]I've not... Actually, I have.
[197:22.94]Um...
[197:33.01]Damn it.

[197:38.61]I've not watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[197:41.39]I will... Um... I saw Nightbot post a link and I was about to fucking ban Nightbot.
[197:48.32]I was about to permanently ban Nightbot from the channel.
[197:54.78]I saw a link and I was like, delete.
[197:58.88]For real though, thanks for the one dollar.
[198:02.88]German, this may sound weird, but I have this daydream where you and Star are singing Not Crying by Flight of the Conchords and you two become best friends at the end.
[198:13.71]That's a pretty interesting dream.
[198:15.93]I will say.
[198:18.97]Dark Star, thanks for the one dollar.
[198:20.39]I'm sorry, but your taste in YouTube comedy is questionable.
[198:23.18]No, it is.
[198:23.54]Come on.
[198:27.56]It's perfect.
[198:31.99]Not Dead Mod Kyle again, thanks for the 25 cents.
[198:34.03]Bit more of random trivia for you, Jerma.
[198:35.61]Forrest Mars and Bruce Murray invented M&Ms.
[198:39.51]The two M&Ms stand for their last names.
[198:42.25]I ain't googling M&Ms.
[198:43.28]I ain't never going to type any... You know what?
[198:45.78]I'm not going to even talk... I'm never eating candy again.
[198:48.98]I'm never going to McDonald's again.
[198:50.06]I'm never eating candy again.
[198:51.78]I'm never watching anything, any TV shows for the rest of my life.
[198:57.33]Not Dead Mod Kyle again, thanks for the 50 cents.
[198:59.23]I'll be praying for your mother.

[199:11.64]Appreciate the concern, thank you.
[199:16.18]Casey, thanks for the $1 again.
[199:17.56]Please watch the Iowa pig calling contest on stream.

[200:23.28]Hey, Jeremy, I missed the stream, but I stopped by to say hope your mom is okay.
[200:26.88]And that maybe if you cut your hair, you wouldn't look like Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith.
[200:31.62]When he murders a bunch of, uh, Padawans.
[200:35.18]Padawans.
[200:35.74]What are they called?

[201:34.83]Thank you KXZ for the five, for the ten bucks.
[201:39.37]For real, we'd turn up even if it was just you voicing over a PowerPoint slideshow.

[202:01.27]Fuck me.
[202:02.79]Stix, thanks for the 50 cents.
[202:03.87]Hello, fellow Scaly.
[202:06.64]Stix has just admitted that he was a reptile.
[202:08.30]I don't know what that means for everybody.
[202:12.30]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $1.
[202:13.66]Hey, I know you don't watch much anime, but do you know the Studio Ghibli movies?
[202:17.90]I always felt those were kind of an exception when it comes to that.
[202:20.23]Anyway, don't ask me why, but I just absolutely out of nowhere thought you'd probably enjoy Porco Rosso.
[202:29.31]Uh, I enjoy, I do enjoy Studio Ghibli.
[202:33.05]I have seen Princess Mononoke.
[202:36.17]I have seen the Moving Castle, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away.
[202:42.51]Uh, I think that's, those are the only ones I've seen.
[202:46.59]And one of them I was shitfaced.
[202:48.43]It was in college.
[202:49.09]I was really drunk during Howl's Moving Castle.
[202:54.52]So I, like, technically didn't even watch Howl's Moving Castle because, like, I couldn't even tell you one scene from that movie.
[202:59.70]All I know is just being, like, sly.
[203:02.11]Fuck.
[203:02.75]Jesus.
[203:05.05]Okay.
[203:13.15]Wait, was Akira with Studio Ghibli?
[203:18.05]I've seen Akira.
[203:21.08]Akira, was Akira Studio Ghibli, though?
[203:23.38]I don't think it was him.
[203:30.61]No.
[203:32.25]Akira was not, no.
[203:33.63]Okay.
[203:34.35]Yeah, I didn't think it was.
[203:36.39]I've seen that, though.
[203:39.33]Mr. Dunwich, thanks for the $1.

[204:13.51]Oh, I didn't even...
[204:18.87]Don't do this to me.
[204:20.40]You can't do this to me.
[204:21.50]It was an honest... It wasn't even a mistake.
[204:24.34]Somebody else found it.
[204:26.30]I showed you a picture of a fucking... Of a McDonald's mascot.
[204:31.70]And somebody else went the next step.
[204:35.99]Don't do this to me.
