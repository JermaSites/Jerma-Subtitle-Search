[ve:60.16.100]

[00:21.14]Are you fucking kidding me?
[00:23.36]I pressed the turn on stream button.
[00:25.56]I just turned it on.
[00:26.98]Just pressed the fucking button.
[00:28.62]And my internet's dead.
[00:30.96]Oh boy.
[00:31.76]Oh boy, I'm fucking mad.
[00:33.22]Oh boy, I'm mad.
[00:35.16]Oh, I'm fucking steaming mad.
[00:36.74]I am red hot right now.
[00:39.86]I'm hot.
[00:42.95]Just literally press the button and I'm red hot.
[00:48.32]I've dropped 50.
[00:48.70]Oh my god.
[00:49.78]This is so fucking annoying.
[00:51.24]I was sitting here.
[00:52.84]I was sitting in this chair doing speed test after speed test after speed test for an hour and a half.
[01:02.41]And everything was okay.
[01:03.51]It wasn't fantastic, but it was enough to stream.
[01:05.75]And now you're telling me that I pressed the fucking button.
[01:11.71]And now I can't stream.
[01:14.15]Oh, man, that's annoying.
[01:15.87]Whoa, that's... That's a very, very annoying thing.
[01:19.61]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[01:28.41]If I had done one more speed test, I would have been able to figure out that it wasn't going to work.
[01:38.45]It's probably so choppy.
[01:39.65]I'm dropping almost every... I'm dropping more frames than I am showing frames.
[01:46.05]Why did I... If I had known this, I wouldn't have notified.
[01:49.41]I wouldn't have sent a notification to all your goddamn phones.
[01:57.33]Turn down the resolution.
[02:05.96]Well... I tried.
[02:13.21]I gotta figure this out, because this is starting to get truly on my nerves.
[02:18.39]Truly.
[02:21.94]I'm gonna turn the intro off, because... Hey!
[02:26.10]Hey!
[02:26.68]Thanks for sticking around, everybody!
[02:29.54]As you can see, that was a stream.
[02:30.98]That was a good stream.
[02:31.96]That was a stream where we played a game called... The Internet!
[02:41.40]That's the fastest stream I've ever done.
[02:42.96]Hey, my stream started and stopped before 7 o'clock.
[02:49.72]Do you understand?
[02:50.98]I was so early that the stream isn't even happening at all.
[02:55.75]Un-fucking-believable.
[02:58.33]I'm gonna sit here and see if it fixes.
[03:00.65]It was perfectly fine until apparently 10 seconds ago.
[03:08.25]Ugh.
[03:09.88]God, if you guys could see, I wish, you know, fly on the wall.
[03:12.58]If one of you guys has my house bugged, you'll, let's say there was a camera over here, just like built into the fucking wall.
[03:19.44]You could have seen the smile on my face when I was ready.
[03:23.70]I was, it was, okay, we got, alright, another speed test.
[03:27.35]Okay, looks like we're in the clear.
[03:28.61]Another speed test.
[03:29.43]Alright, we're in the clear here.
[03:30.43]Okay.
[03:31.87]And then I press the button and it's a comedy.
[03:34.33]It is a comedy.
[03:38.48]Call Comcast already?
[03:43.22]Well, you don't think I haven't called these motherfuckers?
[03:52.63]I'm glad I didn't tweet yet.
[03:54.43]I did not tweet yet.
[03:59.43]I'm sorry, everybody.
[04:01.23]But yet again, we're at the mercy of the internet.
[04:08.02]You know, I mean, you guys can hear me talk, right?
[04:10.28]Hold on a second.
[04:11.92]I ain't doing this shit.
[04:13.92]Here's what we're gonna do.
[04:17.09]God damn it.
[04:22.77]I might not be able to show you any video, but that doesn't mean I can't be on the telephone with you.
[04:32.96]Like, how about this?
[04:33.62]We're going to rename this stream.
[04:36.20]Until I get so annoyed with my current circumstances, here's what we're going to do.
[04:48.18]So you guys have to answer the phone, okay?
[04:49.80]This is going to be a telephone stream.
[04:54.14]So go ahead and, if you could, we're going to start this right.
[04:57.51]We're going to do this right, okay?
[05:04.13]Let's do it.
[05:07.63]Make sure you guys pick up the phone.
[05:11.05]You love that smart TV.
[05:13.29]That's not... Hold on.
[05:21.06]Phone hasn't rang yet.
[05:29.54]Privacy.
[05:34.58]Okay.
[05:52.10]Hello?
[05:54.06]Oh, no, you ain't.
[05:54.72]Oh, yo, you answered the phone, right.
[05:56.06]Hey, how are you?
[05:57.80]How are you guys doing?
[06:00.92]Yeah, it's me.
[06:03.10]Jeremy, how you doing?
[06:05.78]No, no, you called me.
[06:07.28]Sometimes, you know, the signals up in the big space up there.
[06:12.48]Sometimes they get crossed.
[06:13.67]I called you, you called me, and we both said hello at the same time.
[06:15.89]That's strange.
[06:18.21]How you doing, man?
[06:18.89]I haven't heard from you in a while.
[06:19.93]It's been like four days since I was able to stream.
[06:25.59]Hold on a second.
[06:25.95]Hold on.
[06:26.15]I got another call.
[06:28.48]Hello?
[06:29.34]Who's this?
[06:31.97]Fuck me, dude.
[06:33.14]I'm trying to make myself happy.
[06:35.82]And like, it's not working.
[06:37.46]It's not working.
[06:38.08]I got to make myself happy right now.
[06:40.06]Like, I'm so angry.
[06:41.08]Hold on a minute.
[06:41.58]Wait, I need to like get happy.
[06:45.18]That's probably the name from some shitty Adam Sandler movie.
[06:47.54]What would get happy?
[07:01.68]Dude, how do I drop frames?
[07:03.81]Actually, there are frames to drop.
[07:06.61]I guess so.
[07:08.79]This is from Frank Sinatra.
[07:10.01]This is called Get Happy.
[07:10.99]Let's see if this works.
[07:18.96]Wait, we need lyrics.
[07:21.04]I need lyrics.
[07:21.88]I'm going to sing along.
[07:26.80]I've never heard this song before in my life.
[07:29.54]I'm going to sing along with him.
[07:33.52]Why, why is this one faster?
[07:35.24]And like higher pitched?
[07:38.82]This one is like three times faster.
[07:41.10]Forget your troubles and just get happy.
[07:43.42]You better chase your cares away.
[07:45.19]I've heard this song before.
[07:46.27]Sing hallelujah.
[07:46.87]Come on and get happy.
[07:48.81]Get ready for the judgment day.
[07:50.59]Why would you, what?
[07:51.15]The sun is shining, come on and get happy.
[07:52.93]Everybody dies, that's why you have, what are you talking about?
[07:54.51]The Lord is waiting to
[07:55.85]Oh, it's about, like, rising up and being part of the rapture.
[07:58.12]That's fucked up.
[07:59.16]I didn't know this was any of my songs.
[08:03.70]This is higher pitched.
[08:05.54]Listen to him.
[08:06.34]He sounds like a fucking Alvin and the Chipmunks character.
[08:08.62]Wait a minute.
[08:10.68]Listen.
[08:11.10]What the fuck are you?
[08:12.54]This guy's, like, naked on my screen.
[08:23.11]what you haven't played world of warships yet no I haven't yeah play this play the video oh my god play play the video gang bangers these are not dealing with different play the video I'm getting so many ads what I thought you could fix I think you could skip the ads hey
[08:51.92]Is this one faster than the last one?
[08:53.26]Play World of Warships.
[08:58.74]See?
[08:58.96]Listen!
[09:00.70]I'm gonna play the other one too, at the same time.
[09:02.91]I'm certain.
[09:23.72]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[09:25.12]Listen.
[09:27.59]I'm losing my mind over this.
[09:30.73]This is actually pretty important.
[09:32.45]Ready?
[09:32.69]Okay, we got that one now.
[09:35.29]It keeps getting higher.
[09:49.39]I don't know what the hell that other person uploaded, but that is not Get Sinatra Frank Happy.
[09:54.39]Whatever the name of the song is.
[09:56.29]I just mixed it.
[09:57.77]It didn't work.
[09:59.03]I've got to find something else.
[10:01.82]I have to find something else.
[10:05.08]Play them together and be the baritone.
[10:07.18]Okay, let's try that.
[10:09.42]I don't know.
[10:09.86]This is going to be hard to queue up.
[10:11.80]In fact, this is going to be impossible to queue up, but I'm going to try because we're going to get happy.
[10:22.05]When does this one start?
[10:24.10]One and one second.
[10:25.56]This one starts... Okay, this one, I can play this one first and then bingo, bongo.
[10:43.14]Forget your troubles and just get happy.
[10:45.48]You want to chase those cares away.
[10:48.17]Sing hallelujah, come on, get happy.
[10:51.17]Get ready for the judgment day.
[10:53.45]The sun is shining.
[10:54.79]Alright, we're done with this.
[11:00.23]Excuse me.
[11:00.83]Oh, that's it.
[11:01.49]Oh, excuse me.
[11:02.45]Excuse me.
[11:19.26]Somebody answer the fucking phone.
[11:20.34]Nobody's writing it.
[11:21.60]Somebody say something.
[11:24.22]What?
[11:24.50]Why did you guys wait?
[11:25.18]You don't wait.
[11:26.06]Look, if you wait four rings on a phone, that means you fucking don't care.
[11:29.96]I'm one of those people.
[11:31.46]You don't answer the phone in one ring, two rings.
[11:35.59]Then something's wrong.
[11:37.11]That means you're looking at the phone.
[11:38.81]You see my name come up.
[11:41.22]The first ring goes by.
[11:42.56]You're contemplating, do I answer this fucking guy's phone call?
[11:46.00]I don't know.
[11:46.58]I don't really like this guy.
[11:47.62]He's probably going to talk my ear off.
[11:48.84]Two rings go by.
[11:50.54]And now I'm getting nervous on the other side.
[11:52.97]Like if you give three or four full rings, that means that I know that you didn't want to answer the phone.
[11:59.23]You're not in the shower.
[12:06.21]Delay?
[12:06.79]What do you mean delay?
[12:09.88]What am I delaying?
[12:10.70]I can't stream.
[12:14.56]I'm not delaying.
[12:15.34]There's no stream tonight.
[12:16.74]I've dropped 25,000 frames since I started the stream eight minutes ago.
[12:25.84]Wait, what do you mean delay?
[12:26.82]It was an internet delay.
[12:30.35]Oh, oh, I thought you guys were like, this is what I'm talking about.
[12:33.03]I'm so pissed off right now.
[12:34.35]I can't even comprehend the words and language.
[12:37.59]I'm not even incorporating.
[12:39.19]Incorporating, is that a word?
[12:40.99]What is incorporating?
[12:42.13]Incorporating.
[12:45.05]That's like six words.
[12:46.99]I just put six words together.
[12:48.33]That's how like just fucking red steaming mad I am.
[12:50.87]This is the word I just said.
[13:04.74]There.
[13:06.26]I was incorporating it.
[13:10.49]Hey, welcome to the stream, everybody.
[13:17.48]Call Etalyx during his... No, I don't want to fucking ruin Etalyx' stream.
[13:21.12]He's probably doing a thing right now.
[13:29.38]It's about 20 seconds.
[13:30.60]Wait, did they... Hold on a minute.
[13:31.88]Is my internet really that bad that you... It's like 20 full seconds?
[13:37.53]Alright, I... Tell me, like, literally right... When you hear this, tell me.
[13:45.86]Okay.
[13:56.33]Holy shit, that is so much longer than usual.
[13:58.07]That's like 14-15 seconds.
[14:00.77]That's usually like 8 or 9.
[14:04.20]God.
[14:04.94]Get out of here.
[14:08.94]Ugh.
[14:11.18]Heard it.
[14:11.80]I just heard it.
[14:13.76]I'm sorry, everybody.
[14:14.72]I wish there was something I could do about this, but I'm at the mercy of this upload being terrible.
[14:20.46]I don't know why.
[14:23.00]This is after...
[14:25.00]Oh, I'm going to say it.
[14:25.98]I'm going to be a broken record.
[14:27.44]I'm going to be a broken fucking record.
[14:30.56]I promise you guys.
[14:31.64]You can even ask people that were in the chat here.
[14:34.81]I was sitting in the chat.
[14:36.15]I was installing a couple of games.
[14:39.21]And we were talking about it.
[14:40.39]Oh, you know, it looks alright.
[14:44.07]God.
[14:45.27]Fuck me.
[14:45.93]I mean, it's like...
[15:04.09]That's not a broken record.
[15:05.79]How is that a broken record sound effect?
[15:07.95]I was wondering what the hell was going on.
[15:09.72]Why was that?
[15:10.84]I was looking for broken record sound effect.
[15:15.10]No, this is what a broken, what was it called?
[15:17.50]Record.
[15:17.78]There we go.
[15:28.15]So I'm sitting there looking at the internet and I was only downloading two or three items, tried to start my stream and we couldn't do it.
[15:38.61]I'm done.
[15:39.07]I'm out of here.
[15:39.91]I can't even fucking do this.
[15:41.75]This is so bad.
[15:43.25]I'm like reaching for terrible humor.
[15:45.37]Like I'm trying, I'm reaching in the outsources of my brain to pull in terrible shit humor.
[15:55.14]this fuck me fuck the internet the record scratch took too long so I couldn't come up with I was waiting for it and it fucked me up broken record yeah it's a broke it's a records broken if that had been a
[16:22.80]Like a second or two earlier on the record scratch.
[16:25.30]I would have had something perfect, but I waited too long and my brain was going, is this even a real sound?
[16:28.66]Is this a screamer?
[16:29.36]And then like I couldn't do it.
[16:32.52]Does this cost long distance?
[16:33.84]This is just a sound effect stream now.
[16:35.92]I'm so sorry, everybody.
[16:39.16]I would not have started the stream if I knew it was going to be like this.
[16:46.84]Anyways, thanks to Sam for the five bucks.
[16:49.02]One day you will get to stream again.
[16:50.50]I know.
[16:51.18]Seriously.
[16:53.83]This is so annoying.
[16:56.02]I'm not going to say it again because I don't want to be... I don't want to, you know, I don't want to, uh... I don't even have the sound effect anymore, so nevermind.
[17:04.56]Yeah, I do.
[17:11.55]That's not a record scratch.
[17:12.81]I know what it was.
[17:13.65]I was doing it to be a fucking funny guy.
[17:20.98]Thank you though, Sam.
[17:22.51]Also, thanks to Stix Renegade for the $1 Make Me Smile by Chicago.
[17:27.07]No, no more copyrighted music.
[17:28.45]We're only doing royalty-free music.
[17:31.96]Oh, God, Snakes, thanks for the bits.
[17:34.10]Thank you, Assman.
[17:35.86]I think that's what I'm calling you now.
[17:40.30]Ass... Assern... I'm so stupid.
[17:45.83]Thank you for the $5, though.
[17:47.95]I just want to thank you for the years of entertainment.
[17:50.11]I've been following you since 1783.
[17:51.63]Well, back when the gold rush, right?
[17:53.43]When you wrote a most humorous essay in the Boston Gazette.
[17:56.89]You never failed to bring me to my knees with that iron wit of yours.
[18:01.07]It saddens me deeply that you had to leave the Gazette when this continued in 1798.
[18:05.73]Can this humble fan hope that you will continue to publish your satirical writings in other publications?
[18:10.95]Perhaps the New England Courant.
[18:13.48]Best wishes, Edgel... Best wishes, Edgelberry Heinstein.
[18:20.38]That was a good one.
[18:21.36]I like that one.
[18:23.00]Thank you, Edgelberry.
[18:25.97]Thank you, Chunky Bologna for the 15 bucks.
[18:27.87]Money will make you happy.
[18:29.95]Now, don't you know, like in every single... The money doesn't make people happy.
[18:34.15]It's... It's the self.
[18:36.69]It's the person.
[18:37.57]It's the community.
[18:39.49]Money doesn't make anybody happy.
[18:41.82]Scrooge McDuck was a miserable asshole.
[18:46.36]Scrooge, like, like, Ebenezer Scrooge?
[18:49.02]What a dick.
[18:51.50]He had to get visited by three dead people before he even thought to, like, pay a cent to anybody.
[19:03.32]Greedy liar stream.
[19:06.64]Ah.
[19:09.35]Money doesn't make you happy.
[19:10.45]Working internet does.
[19:16.51]Money doesn't make you happy.
[19:17.82]It's the thought that counts.
[19:21.36]So that's two sayings that I put together.
[19:23.08]I don't even know what that's the thought.
[19:24.80]It's not how much it costs.
[19:26.76]It's not the thing you give.
[19:27.78]It's the thought that counts.
[19:30.40]So Scrooge McDuck wouldn't give no thoughts ever.
[19:35.97]But thank you, Styx, for the $1 again.
[19:38.47]ASMR stream.
[19:39.39]Actually, I am going to do an ASMR stream.
[19:41.89]And I'm so mad.
[19:42.71]I don't even care.
[19:43.09]I'm going to spoil the whole thing.
[19:45.31]I'm doing it.
[19:45.91]I'm buying one of those fucking stupid, elaborate, goofy, Mr. Magoo ear headset things.
[19:53.93]The thing has like a face and ears.
[19:55.31]I'm going to buy it.
[19:55.81]I'm going to do one.
[19:57.21]I swear to God, this is happening probably sooner than you think.
[19:59.41]It's going to be a loud fucking stream.
[20:03.53]I'm not going to spoil it.
[20:08.00]Just know that the one joke, here's one joke you're gonna get.
[20:10.08]Because this is gonna be like fucking a bunch of dumb shit.
[20:11.90]I'm buying like giant cymbals.
[20:13.76]There you go.
[20:14.76]Sorry, I'm spoiling this.
[20:15.80]I'm so angry right now.
[20:16.66]I don't even care.
[20:19.27]It's gonna be like, start with an ASMR stream and then we're gonna bring cymbals in.
[20:26.33]Those are really expensive.
[20:31.17]Binaural microphone.
[20:32.61]That's what it is, yeah.
[20:34.43]First, I'm going to start scratching behind your ear and be like, itchy ears.
[20:41.13]And then that's when the fucking tuba comes in.
[20:47.63]Ruining jokes.
[20:48.53]Don't worry, there's going to be more.
[20:51.41]There's going to be way more funny shit.
[20:53.19]Way more funny shit.
[20:54.43]That's not funny yet.
[20:55.99]Nobody laughed at it yet.
[20:58.55]Don't assume that your jokes are funny until somebody laughs at them.
[21:05.88]There's one thing in particular that I can't wait to do.
[21:10.49]I have to actually, I have to hire somebody for this to be a thing on that stream.
[21:14.49]And I don't care what it takes.
[21:18.29]Hopefully you guys think it's funny.
[21:21.88]Stop laughing, guys.
[21:27.84]What a weird time to drop in.
[21:30.77]Yeah.
[21:31.83]Yeah.
[21:34.54]How many frames did I drop on that last stream?
[21:37.62]Because... It... We're talking about, like... We're talking about 52% of every frame is dropped.
[21:46.98]Why?
[21:47.48]I don't understand what is causing this.
[21:51.17]If only I knew.
[21:53.25]Anyways, thank you to... Thank you to Hasnain for the $1.
[21:59.03]Shit, internet or not, we still love you.
[22:01.03]Thank you, Has.
[22:02.98]Thank you for the $1 as well.
[22:04.10]Thank you, CommandRabbit, CMDRabbit for the $1.
[22:06.64]Use your phone as a connection point.
[22:10.01]That would be even worse.
[22:13.77]I don't think I could even stream from my phone.
[22:15.57]It would not even work.
[22:16.49]I don't think I even have like 100k I could even do up.
[22:24.95]Jackbox.
[22:25.65]Didn't Jackbox just come out with a new party pack?
[22:29.46]I would get it.
[22:30.58]Oh, by the way, I need to change the stream title to, like, don't watch this stream.
[22:34.32]It's just a shit telephone stream.
[22:36.24]Because right now it says, like, I cleaned my closet.
[22:38.91]Hold on.
[22:42.29]Broken internet telephone stream.
[22:47.59]There.
[22:48.43]I'm not gonna put it- I'm not putting this in IRL.
[22:50.55]I'm sorry.
[22:52.35]I'm not gonna, like, be on the IRL section with this screen.
[23:02.47]Clickbait.
[23:09.78]How can you watch something that doesn't exist?
[23:12.64]It's a good question.
[23:17.86]When did I start a podcast?
[23:21.93]I don't know.
[23:24.55]Thank you to FJBH10 for the $1.
[23:26.69]They say jug.
[23:27.55]They say jug a bunch of times.
[23:29.81]You're talking essentially to jupe?
[23:31.19]Like Jupiter?
[23:33.35]Anyways, thanks for the $1.
[23:34.25]Thank you, ReptilianGod, for the $5.
[23:35.99]Play fart sound effects.
[23:37.67]I might as well.
[23:40.65]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[23:41.77]Fine, sure.
[23:42.35]I'll play one.
[23:43.39]You know, you pay $5, you get one fart sound effect.
[23:51.15]Hey, fart sound effect on YouTube.
[23:53.95]Please sign in to confirm your age.
[23:57.01]This video may be inappropriate.
[23:59.03]I need to be 18 to hear a guy fart into his microphone.
[24:02.54]Are you serious?
[24:03.48]Why?
[24:03.78]How about one hour of farting?
[24:06.70]Nope.
[24:07.14]You need to sign into YouTube.
[24:08.36]Really, YouTube?
[24:09.38]Really?
[24:11.47]We need to be 18 to listen to farts now?
[24:14.65]This is unbelievable.
[24:16.77]That wasn't even real.
[24:20.01]That was just... Why do I need to sign in for that?
[24:25.15]Well, this just shows you YouTube.com and how terrible they are, okay?
[24:29.97]So, I couldn't just listen to the fart sound effects from before, but I scroll down the page like three or four videos, and I can watch ten minutes of random funny fart sounds.
[24:44.96]YouTube, somebody at that... You've got to change that algorithm, man.
[24:49.00]Something ain't right with that.
[24:49.68]Google.com.
[24:52.36]And, well, it's alphabet, actually, at this point.
[24:54.68]For some reason, they have this weird policy where half of the site gets censored and shit, but there's still portions of the site.
[25:02.61]You can still watch this stuff in half.
[25:05.35]I can't do it.
[25:06.17]It's too hard.
[25:10.33]That was very difficult.
[25:13.09]Haha, so funny.
[25:14.13]That wasn't supposed to be funny.
[25:18.29]God damn it, I'm
[25:44.49]Hi, I'm calling from Insurance International.
[25:47.93]We were just curious if you want to take five minutes of your time, I might be able to save you $200 on this phone call.
[25:55.54]At Insurance International, we take pride in how we... Oh, what's that?
[26:02.78]What is it?
[26:03.10]Please put me on the do not call list.
[26:11.25]Hang up.
[26:11.55]That's when you hung the phone up.
[26:18.63]You know what's really terrible about when you get phone calls from telemarketers?
[26:23.59]See, they have a script in front of them that they read the first paragraph.
[26:28.21]So it's almost like you feel terrible having to cut them off.
[26:31.46]So you just let them do their thing.
[26:34.82]The person will call you and give you a full two paragraphs.
[26:38.82]And all of us want to just be like, excuse, like, shut up.
[26:42.26]Excuse me.
[26:42.80]Hello.
[26:43.20]Hello.
[26:43.50]Hey, stop it.
[26:44.86]But you don't.
[26:45.22]You let them do their whole script.
[26:47.53]Sometimes it even goes as far as I will let these people do the whole thing.
[26:52.71]And I'm like, I feel terrible about it.
[26:55.19]They'll sit there and tell me every detail.
[26:56.93]And I'm like, yeah, who are you calling from again?
[26:58.84]And they'll just keep going.
[27:01.24]And then eventually I'll be like, no, I'm sorry.
[27:02.68]I'm sorry.
[27:03.08]Not interested.
[27:03.56]Put me on the do not call list.
[27:04.80]Thank you for your time, though.
[27:05.70]Thank you.
[27:06.66]Like, why am I thanking them?
[27:11.06]I feel like I'm just I feel so terrible when people call and they give me the script.
[27:17.24]I just hang up no you don't ever just hang up if you just hang up when you're setting yourself up for a disaster you need to put yourself on the do not call list because if you just hang up on these people they skip you and somebody else in that same database will call you again I know because I used to do it for a living I didn't do it for a living I'm just I did it for like a couple of weeks and I almost got fired twice
[27:47.39]A friend of mine used to work at the same telemarketing firm, and he would always tell me how badly he wanted to do
[27:56.09]There's this certain joke, and I thought it was fucking hilarious, but, you know, it probably would have gotten the company fined.
[28:02.85]But what he wanted to do is, you know how you try to rush that person off the phone?
[28:06.58]So, hi, how you doing?
[28:07.60]My name is Arnold Elbertson from Stevenson International.
[28:12.90]I'm calling because, and then they're like, no, no, excuse me, excuse me.
[28:16.15]Please put me on the do not call list.
[28:17.79]And it's like, oh, okay, that's fine.
[28:20.11]Somebody else is going to get the free $5 million.
[28:21.79]Okay, thanks.
[28:22.77]Sorry, goodbye.
[28:23.43]And you hang up.
[28:25.06]And that person's just like, wait, what?
[28:27.80]Five million?
[28:30.97]That would have got the company like, people would have gone to jail for that, you know?
[28:35.23]Imagine somebody called you and you did that to them.
[28:45.55]Like, what are you, friends?
[28:46.27]Yeah, no shit, it was a bad idea.
[28:52.06]What a fucking bad person.
[28:57.80]Did I actually work at a call center?
[28:59.12]Yes, I did.
[29:00.70]That is 100% true.
[29:07.02]How terrible is that job?
[29:07.94]It actually really isn't that bad.
[29:11.85]As long as you're honest.
[29:16.14]here's where it got really really sketchy and I didn't even know this until years later so people would fill out these cards like by the way guys if you ever see like a kiosk that has like free red sox tickets enter here just put your name and your phone number and your address and slip it into the box
[29:41.53]You've seen those before, right?
[29:44.45]You might be able to win this fucking mall car.
[29:48.11]Don't fall for the mall car bullshit.
[29:49.89]I'm shocked that's even still able to be a thing.
[29:53.65]The mall car is just a way to get as many people as possible to write their fucking names down on a piece of paper to get themselves on a sucker list for telemarketers.
[30:05.82]Because they sell all that data.
[30:13.82]How do they get the mall car?
[30:14.92]How do they get the car into the mall?
[30:18.06]They have to, they must have to build that car inside the mall and leave it there.
[30:23.24]The same mall car has been in my local mall for like 16 fucking years.
[30:29.94]There's a motor, there's always a motorcycle too.
[30:31.68]There's two motorcycles and a mall car.
[30:37.91]Those two motorcycles have been there for probably fucking 30 years.
[30:41.69]They don't do anything.
[30:42.31]They're not real.
[30:48.49]They drive it in.
[30:49.21]They don't drive it in.
[30:50.67]It's made out of plastic.
[30:54.70]It's made out of plastic.
[30:57.72]Next time you go to the mall and there's a mall car there, just ask the guy, excuse me, sir, is this car made out of plastic?
[31:03.58]And he's gonna, his face is gonna get fucking purple.
[31:06.93]He's gonna be beet red.
[31:08.11]Of course not.
[31:10.27]Of course, it's made out of the finest materials that Honda could bring into our mall.
[31:15.65]And then he's gonna fucking, he's gonna grab an associate and just start talking to somebody else and be like, I'll be with you in a minute, sir.
[31:22.66]Hey, plastic.
[31:27.62]Inside the car, painted cardboard.
[31:29.46]You're not gonna win that car.
[31:31.20]You don't want that car.
[31:37.42]What did I walk into?
[31:38.44]Honestly, I'm surprised I've still been sitting here for this long.
[31:47.46]I feel terrible about it.
[31:56.35]As long as we can have a little bit of fun, right?
[31:58.37]Before my internet explodes.
[32:03.06]I paid the bill, right?
[32:04.30]Yeah, of course I did.
[32:05.14]Because if I didn't pay the bill, I wouldn't even be able to stream at all.
[32:08.46]They turn you off.
[32:11.32]They put a wrench on the internet pipe and they... And then there's no more internet flow to your house.
[32:23.55]The viewer count just keeps going up.
[32:27.50]God damn it.
[32:36.66]you have speed test open while I'm streaming no I don't have speed test open now speed test is not like running in the background I ran it right before the stream started and like agdq is going on right now like guys like go watch go watch that stream like don't even watch this one this this is like seriously hold on like
[33:04.45]Do we really need a stroller with one hand easy fold?
[33:07.17]Oh, my lord.
[33:09.86]You love that smart TV.
[33:12.62]People wonder why people don't like YouTube ads.
[33:16.00]Hey, YouTube.
[33:17.24]Please show me the same fucking advertisement.
[33:20.84]700 times.
[33:22.22]I wonder why everybody uses Adblock on the site.
[33:24.77]Hmm, that's crazy.
[33:26.27]Why do people have Adblock turned on for YouTube?
[33:29.41]You support those creators.
[33:31.17]Hey, but you want to watch the same fucking smart TV ad 700 times?
[33:37.38]You sure you don't want to do that?
[33:39.10]Support those creators.
[33:41.82]Jesus.
[33:52.65]Telephone fast busy signal and hang up sound effects.
[34:05.05]That is so true.
[34:06.35]I've watched the same ad 50 times today and yesterday.
[34:10.83]God.
[34:14.46]YouTube pays shit nowadays.
[34:15.88]I mean, it does.
[34:18.98]They've kind of made that not a good revenue stream anymore.
[34:25.33]Not that it was like anything outrageous.
[34:26.59]I mean, it kind of was pretty lucrative.
[34:28.93]If you were pulling in huge views on YouTube like four years ago, three years ago, back when you could upload you running away from zombies in Call of Duty...
[34:44.13]I mean, that was a thing.
[34:45.01]Anyway, speaking of money, thank you to Comrade Benus.
[35:07.09]That's an upside down penis, I see.
[35:08.68]I see what you're doing.
[35:10.66]The B is upside down P for penis.
[35:12.74]Got it.
[35:14.16]$5.
[35:14.18]Thank you for being a good stand-up video game comedian.
[35:16.58]Can't wait to see what you have in store for us in this new year.
[35:19.41]I love you.
[35:21.25]God bless.
[35:22.15]I couldn't control that one.
[35:23.23]Thank you, comrade Venus Penis.
[35:28.10]Thanks for the $5.
[35:35.13]Thank you again to AsslessSauce.
[35:40.05]I'm never going to get your name right.
[35:41.17]There's no capitals in your name.
[35:42.33]I can't even read it.
[35:44.25]It's 1.30 a.m.
[35:44.63]and I'm talking with you on the phone.
[35:46.93]What am I doing?
[35:47.55]How did you get my number?
[35:49.47]I have everybody's number in here.
[35:53.02]I have a twitch.tv video phone database.
[35:57.80]It's click to call.
[35:59.20]New technology.
[36:00.52]New technology.
[36:02.42]New...
[36:04.58]It is.
[36:06.08]Click to call.
[36:06.92]Click to call technology.
[36:08.92]Click a number.
[36:09.46]Click a name.
[36:10.30]Number dials.
[36:11.00]Click to call.
[36:15.13]Hey, move means move.
[36:15.75]Thanks for the five bucks.
[36:17.67]Telemarketers are putting mall cars in my tap water.
[36:20.19]Do not call me again.
[36:24.81]Thank you to D Jack for the $1.
[36:26.39]What other jobs have you had?
[36:28.67]It'd be interesting to hear about your history in between school and YouTube.
[36:32.89]I've worked in a supermarket, a cafe, and now I work at a bakery while I go through university.
[36:37.66]Well, I've a bit more like actual like jobs that I actually really actually had.
[36:43.78]I mean, that was a wedding videographer.
[36:51.02]I mean, yeah, I was like the cliche, like default wedding videographer guy.
[37:00.69]Before that, I did everything from substitute teaching to...
[37:09.95]Trying to think of like other like real, real in-quote jobs that I had.
[37:13.43]And when I use that, no, that means, you guys think I'm like dealing drugs if I say that.
[37:16.95]No, like I'm talking like I had jobs where I had like a W-2, right?
[37:30.30]Wait, what?
[37:32.52]The man who did it all.
[37:36.04]Yeah, I was a substitute teacher.
[37:37.95]I used to fucking annoy people on the telephone.
[37:41.83]And pointed a camera at couples.
[37:44.63]I did it all.
[37:48.67]Go update the IMDB.
[37:57.57]Jack of all trades.
[38:13.33]Substitute teaching sucks.
[38:14.77]No one stays with it for very long.
[38:18.97]I mean, it's kind of an in-between thing, right?
[38:22.90]I love that somebody just came in and says, what the fuck is a telephone stream?
[38:30.84]I'll tell you.
[38:31.38]I'll show you.
[38:31.88]This is...
[38:56.69]Hello, it's me, your dear Aunt Carol.
[39:00.69]I got your Christmas card in the mail.
[39:03.59]And oh boy, do you have... Hold on, I have another phone call.
[39:07.19]It auto-played on YouTube.
[39:09.35]Hello?
[39:10.71]Who's this?
[39:12.53]Who's that?
[39:18.52]Get out of here.
[39:21.68]Am I doing prank calls?
[39:23.01]No, no.
[39:23.57]I need to, like, let's... Let me, like, be very clear with this.
[39:27.01]Telephone... Pretend telephone stream, right?
[39:31.31]Because that's what this actually is.
[39:35.05]Where did it just go?
[39:36.89]Where did it go?
[39:39.63]Where is it?
[39:40.31]Why did it just go away?
[39:45.14]There.
[39:47.52]We're not really on the telephone, so it's a pretend telephone.
[39:54.55]No, we're not doing prank calls.
[39:56.46]I'm sorry.
[39:57.06]That's not going to happen.
[40:02.40]Thank you to Tac.
[40:05.28]Tac PZ for the five dollars.
[40:06.52]My aunt is Carol.
[40:09.64]Well, there you go.
[40:12.08]There you go.
[40:14.44]Aunt Carol.
[40:16.96]Moo means moo.
[40:17.44]Thanks for the one dollar.
[40:18.16]Thought of you teaching anyone anything besides fixing computers is concerning.
[40:24.34]Well, you don't think I was substituting in computer science?
[40:28.48]Come on, man.
[40:30.98]I know HTML.
[40:34.21]You know, you guys don't think I know HTML.
[40:37.19]I want to see somebody say that I don't know HTML.
[40:41.41]I would love for someone to say that.
[40:47.21]Hmm.
[40:47.97]Interesting.
[40:50.64]How would I know what the fuck this means, huh?
[40:52.84]Hmm?
[40:54.68]Oh, it doesn't know HTML, but knows that.
[40:57.34]Why?
[40:57.52]It doesn't know HTML, but doesn't know what that does, huh?
[41:15.25]Huh.
[41:17.17]They don't know HTML.
[41:20.95]Well, that means I must not know this.
[41:23.57]Hmm, interesting.
[41:33.98]That's not even going to fit.
[41:35.74]I was going to copy and paste the source details of like Amazon.com and post it in the chat.
[41:42.92]It just wouldn't fit.
[41:44.12]It just didn't do it.
[41:47.33]Put like an entire webpage's code in the chat.
[41:50.93]Oh, well.
[41:58.63]Thank you, though.
[42:00.03]Also, thank you to FGBH10, again, for the $1.
[42:05.38]Jugg for the stream.
[42:07.70]Jugg is good.
[42:08.72]More upload for Juggs.
[42:10.90]I don't get the Jugg thing.
[42:12.06]Again, FGBH.
[42:14.26]Thanks for the $1.
[42:15.20]More Juggs.
[42:17.62]This is like a boobs thing.
[42:18.96]Are you doing like a boob joke?
[42:22.28]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the $1.
[42:23.36]Loud.
[42:25.53]I don't know what I was loud, but I'm sorry if I was.
[42:28.57]Turian7, thanks for the $5.
[42:29.89]Please mute your mic the next time you... It's getting... Wait, next time I... What?
[42:36.63]Mute your mic the next time you... It's getting to be a bit much.
[42:39.41]What am I muting?
[42:41.17]What's happening?
[42:44.47]It got cut off.
[42:46.49]Thank you to Dracthis for the $1.
[42:50.48]Jermay, will you please tell us how you almost got fired from the call center two times?
[42:55.17]Also, I'm pregnant.
[42:57.30]And I'm the father.
[42:58.42]Well, that's weird.
[43:00.36]That must be like a Jesus baby.
[43:03.52]If I were you, I would open up a religion and see what you can do.
[43:09.40]I almost got fired because my handwriting is so bad.
[43:12.22]So I wrote what we used to do when somebody would actually say, yes, I would like to take you up on your offer.
[43:18.61]You pulled out a sheet and you wrote their name and their information and their credit cards and everything would go on this piece of paper.
[43:24.69]And my handwriting was so awful that we had a guy that had to come over and close the deal.
[43:31.46]So we would say, yes, OK, and thank you so much.
[43:35.40]Now I'm going to let my supervisor take over and he's going to close the deal out for you.
[43:39.63]And a guy would come over, one of our managers, and sit down and go over the information and close the deal because you couldn't do it yourself if you weren't in a position to do so.
[43:46.25]So he came over and sat down and he looked at it and he was just like, excuse me, what's your name again?
[43:51.00]He was doing a really passive aggressive awful thing where you're saying out loud the problem, like the idiocy of the person that you're talking about and you know that they're behind you, but you don't like actively, you laugh a little bit and you're actively insulting the person.
[44:10.43]It's a very passive aggressive thing and it goes like this.
[44:13.25]Yeah, you know, what's your name here again, sir?
[44:17.52]Okay, yeah, okay.
[44:18.94]It's just his handwriting is just terrible.
[44:22.02]Yeah, it's just terrible.
[44:23.78]And okay, let me get that credit card there.
[44:26.44]Excellent work.
[44:27.36]Let me just re-upload you on that credit card.
[44:29.92]Yeah, so 252.
[44:31.10]Yeah, it's just awful.
[44:32.88]It's just awful handwriting.
[44:35.48]And he went, and I'm sitting there.
[44:37.38]He said it like at least 10 times.
[44:39.40]I'm behind him, just like gulp, like a big fucking cartoon gulp was going down my throat.
[44:44.66]And he ended up closing the deal, turned to me, held up the paper and said, if you do something like that to me again, you are going to be fucking out of here.
[44:55.29]And he handed the paper back to me and I got the sale.
[44:59.01]Like I was, I was making, I was like fucking with him.
[45:02.67]Apparently.
[45:04.84]Like, he was so angry that he had to, like, re-up and, like, scribble out and add new lines and write and correct everything.
[45:12.25]Like, I embarrassed him as to what happened.
[45:14.49]He was, like, the big manager for this stupid, shitty fucking telescam company.
[45:19.43]Oh, boy.
[45:20.17]Don't make me look like that again.
[45:21.35]No, that was real.
[45:31.78]That's real.
[45:32.14]That is a real story.
[45:37.51]And it's funny because this guy was really, really nice to me.
[45:41.25]He just kind of like blew up at me and hated me.
[45:44.61]He's the guy that actually hired me.
[45:47.07]I did my interview with this guy and he was so happy to have me on board.
[45:50.27]He was one of those like, yeah, have you on board guys.
[45:53.66]And he turned and he fucking ruined my life.
[45:57.76]Did I quit?
[45:58.32]Yes, I did.
[46:01.56]Hey, you know what's really funny also?
[46:02.78]There was like a dress code.
[46:10.20]I would show up late all the time.
[46:12.60]My whole life, man.
[46:13.54]It'll never escape me.
[46:17.99]This guy that was my boss talked like this.
[46:20.33]He had one of those really fucking thick, gross accents.
[46:22.75]You know what I'm talking about?
[46:23.69]Like this.
[46:25.59]And...
[46:27.64]Every time I came in late a bunch of times and I wasn't wearing, like, a button-up shirt.
[46:31.22]And he's like, yeah, you know, we talked about this the other day.
[46:33.92]And, you know, if you're not wearing a shirt, you know, you come in with whatever you want to wear, that's fine.
[46:39.36]But you're late a couple more times, you're just not going to have a job tomorrow.
[46:42.16]You know, it's just not going to happen.
[46:44.50]You got to get that shirt.
[46:45.24]You come in with just clothes, whatever you want to wear.
[46:46.68]You're just not going to have a job tomorrow.
[46:47.80]You understand?
[46:48.14]He was one of those, like, thick Boston, like, Boston accents.
[46:55.59]And I have a Boston accent.
[46:57.60]But there's Boston accent, and then there's excuse me.
[47:01.67]What did you say, Boston accent?
[47:03.05]You know what I mean?
[47:03.99]I feel like every region has that.
[47:06.11]Like, you have a Southern accent.
[47:07.45]Wow, you have a Southern accent.
[47:08.31]And then you have an excuse me accent, where somebody actually has to ask you, excuse me, what the fuck did you just say?
[47:13.75]Like, there's a Southern accent.
[47:15.34]I bet there's a Southern accent.
[47:16.44]You know what I'm saying?
[47:19.42]Like, there's a New York accent.
[47:21.52]This thing.
[47:22.90]Whatever the fuck this is.
[47:32.11]Like, there's different tiers of what is under.
[47:34.60]And then you go to Scotland.
[47:36.12]Good luck.
[47:39.28]Scotland sounds like a foreign song that someone is singing.
[47:44.56]It's like, I have no idea what people are ever saying when they're speaking Scottish.
[47:50.03]Ever.
[47:52.47]You could speak
[47:54.99]could speak fluent Chinese to me and give me hand signals and I would understand more of what you were saying to me than a Scottish person speaking English Scottish to me and doing the same gestures swear to god I feel attacked
[48:31.33]Streamer falsely advertised telephone pranks and tells anecdotes about bad handwriting.
[48:41.46]What are you talking about?
[48:43.76]Because I can't understand what a Scottish person is saying?
[48:46.20]I don't think it's a bad accent.
[48:53.05]I think Scotland is a beautiful country.
[48:55.51]Wonderful people.
[48:58.31]Hey, excuse me.
[48:59.43]I got ancestry in Scotland, okay?
[49:01.63]You understand?
[49:02.63]I got ancestry over there.
[49:12.61]I got ancestry in Ireland.
[49:14.49]I got ancestry in Scotland.
[49:16.14]I got ancestry in Poland.
[49:18.88]I've got ancestry in Scotland.
[49:21.06]Don't you try to tell me that I don't understand the Scottish people, okay?
[49:29.50]1%?
[49:29.62]No.
[49:33.92]My grandmother's maiden name is McDonald.
[49:36.39]Alright?
[49:39.57]Rhonda McDonald.
[49:42.39]Yeah.
[50:01.78]No, I can't.
[50:02.98]That's... Speak Scottish?
[50:07.66]I don't know Scottish.
[50:13.80]I'm using my ancestry here.
[50:15.72]I just, like, picked a booger out of my nose.
[50:18.33]Good thing the fucking webcam wasn't on.
[50:21.35]What do I do with this?
[50:22.59]I think it's tissue.
[50:23.27]Hold on.
[50:34.60]Nice.
[50:35.30]It was a joke.
[50:36.20]I'm kidding.
[50:37.06]This is a pretend telephone stream.
[50:38.80]This is not a real stream.
[50:45.75]And look, you know what I did with it?
[50:47.29]I ate the booger.
[50:48.49]I'm a booger eater, okay?
[50:50.39]This is a booger eating stream.
[50:52.81]I'm just eating boogers.
[50:54.65]When the webcam isn't on, I just dig up there and I eat the boogers.
[50:57.77]That's what I do.
[51:03.37]Oh, fuck me.
[51:04.86]Can't say shit like that.
[51:10.86]Is this stand-up comedy?
[51:13.74]No, it's just really bad streaming.
[51:19.81]How the fuck do I unsub?
[51:28.19]If you want us to leave... What are you talking about?
[51:31.99]This is all stemming from pure mania.
[51:34.96]Those of you that just got to the stream, if you're unaware.
[51:40.38]So I'm going to tell the story again.
[51:41.72]Don't tell me like, oh, repeat, repeat the same fucking story.
[51:45.30]When I told this story, there was like 1,500 people there.
[51:47.28]There's almost 2,400 people there.
[51:48.68]Let me tell the story.
[51:50.41]So as you know, hold on.
[52:17.00]Hey, what's up, man?
[52:18.70]How you doing?
[52:20.94]So, what happened was... First of all, how you doing?
[52:25.18]It's been like a couple of weeks, right?
[52:26.69]Since I last saw you?
[52:29.31]Cool, nice.
[52:30.05]Nice.
[52:31.75]Yeah, well, I can't hear anything you're saying because you're speaking into a screen.
[52:35.39]So, I'm just judging by somebody on the internet is pretending to be you right now.
[52:39.69]Anyway, so, at the beginning of the stream, like an hour or two, two hours before the stream started,
[52:46.98]As you know, I was having internet problems.
[52:50.27]Over the last week.
[52:51.75]And we got to stream perfectly fine on Friday.
[52:56.22]The stream before that was like all fucked up.
[52:58.50]That's fine.
[52:58.96]Whatever.
[52:59.30]Oh no.
[52:59.62]Let's just try it again on Tuesday.
[53:01.48]So here we are.
[53:02.58]I'm sitting there speed testing.
[53:05.57]Over and over again.
[53:06.65]And my internet is perfect.
[53:08.87]No problems at all.
[53:09.65]I mean, it was like a little shaky.
[53:11.41]But it was not streamable.
[53:13.67]I could have done a perfectly fine stream and everything would have been absolutely wonderful.
[53:19.24]Okay?
[53:20.52]I hit the start streaming button and start a real upload, not a speed test.
[53:25.72]Instantly dead.
[53:26.98]Stream can't even start.
[53:28.79]So that's why we're doing the pretend telephone scam.
[53:32.45]This is telephone stream.
[53:33.43]That's why we're doing this.
[53:36.58]This is not a pre-recorded conversation, Thamper.
[53:39.20]That's right.
[53:39.70]That's a call out into the chat room.
[53:47.52]This is a scam.
[53:49.55]Alright, let's just type in scam into YouTube and see what happens.
[53:56.07]How to win at carnival games.
[53:59.23]Okay.
[54:04.88]What do you got?
[54:05.82]What else you got?
[54:06.46]What else we got going on here?
[54:09.36]Have you guys enjoyed this one hour podcast?
[54:14.02]What a terrible, what a bad podcast this would be.
[54:16.68]Imagine you went to iTunes and you downloaded this.
[54:20.56]This has been the most haphazard strung together with cheesecloth stream podcast.
[54:29.82]What would I even title this?
[54:35.08]There is no title for this.
[54:37.83]Thank you, Morning Maple, for the two bucks.
[54:39.85]Gosh darn it.
[54:41.39]You made me have to say something.
[54:42.67]Hi from Scotland.
[54:43.71]Okay, we've got a real live Scottish person here.
[54:47.55]The Scottish accent you hear on TV is actually only one of them.
[54:52.10]It's Glaswegian.
[54:55.60]Most of them are a lot easier to understand.
[54:57.46]Hope you read this in time.
[54:58.72]Cheer.
[55:00.04]Well, thank you.
[55:00.54]So Glaswegian is that...
[55:04.76]Glaswegian.
[55:06.54]I'm going to type that in.
[55:09.24]I'm going to type in the Glaswegian accent.
[55:15.59]Okay, this one is how to speak and understand Glaswegian.
[55:20.85]See?
[55:21.57]What the fuck did that guy just say?
[55:22.63]How are we supposed to even know?
[55:26.07]This is fucking Waluigian.
[55:28.09]How am I supposed to understand this?
[55:30.75]Hello, and welcome to your first class in how to understand and speak Glaswegian.
[55:38.87]Okay.
[55:41.55]Here we go.
[55:43.79]For as long as he can remember.
[55:45.23]However, he may reply like this.
[55:47.27]Alright, big man, looking for a swally?
[55:49.25]No danger.
[55:49.91]Here's what you want to do, right?
[55:51.07]What you want to do is go straight down the road, right?
[55:52.99]Don't stop till you get to the bus stop, right?
[55:54.91]See across the road?
[55:55.91]MacArthur, he'll sort you right out.
[55:57.69]Catch you after, biggie.
[55:59.35]I heard cashew.
[55:59.99]That's the only word I could hear.
[56:02.05]Did anybody catch anything else?
[56:04.33]I heard eat the cashews and then go to a bus.
[56:07.22]I heard something about a bus.
[56:09.24]Something about a bus stop and something about a road and a cashew.
[56:11.06]That's all I know.
[56:19.67]This is what I was... Everyone just called me out.
[56:22.83]All you guys that called me out in chat.

[62:40.63]This is going to be a VOD tube.
[62:41.88]You're just going to have to VOD this one.
[62:45.02]Unless, like, Mac wants to do something fucking stupid with this.
[62:48.92]This is just a solid black screen with text on it for an hour.
[62:54.22]So, I don't know.
[62:57.83]Also, thank you to... Thank you, Pin, for the $1 earlier.
[63:08.20]I used to tell them that I wanted the service, talking about telemarketing, but I would tell them that they had the wrong information on me.
[63:15.11]So I would give them fake info and halfway through I would hang up.
[63:19.01]That's terrible.
[63:21.29]That is just terrible.
[63:23.31]Oh my goodness.
[63:29.09]Thank you, the one-uppest for the $1.

[64:14.70]Dear Jerma, it's me again.
[64:15.72]After watching the Kill the Memes stream, though I'm open to it, I'm sad to lose some of the most iconic memes of our generation.
[64:22.30]I hope that in 2018 and beyond, they will make better memes that come with harder laughs.
[64:27.78]Good luck, Jerma, and everyone in chat.
[64:30.75]They will.
[64:31.25]There's always something.
[64:33.21]There's always something.
[64:36.50]Twinkly 10, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[64:39.94]I watch your streams all the time from the Jerma Archive channel and unable to watch your stream because I live in Australia.
[64:46.16]Hi from America to Australia.
[64:48.98]I honestly live, like, hi from America to Australia.
[64:51.89]Am I sending you a telegram?
[64:54.31]Am I sending you like a tele, like a, whatever.
[64:57.09]I honestly love your content and your content has helped me through a lot of hard times.

[65:39.72]Yeah, this is just... We're at the one hour mark.
[65:42.42]I think it's time to cut the cord.
[65:45.16]Because I've just been killing time waiting for this to fix itself.
[65:50.93]And I'm still... It's just a red bar.
[65:55.29]And I'm still at 56% drop frames.
[65:58.03]So, I don't... This is not happening.

[66:46.88]Thank you to Hasnain for the $1.
[66:50.82]That sounded more like a road man than a Scottish person.
[66:54.50]A road man.
[66:56.84]Whatever Avenue thanks for the $1.
[66:58.28]Try to say garlic in Scottish.

[67:31.13]Whatever Avenue, again, for the $1.

[67:40.24]Good night, Jerma.
[67:40.74]Good luck with your pretend phone stream.
[67:42.16]Try not to go under a tunnel and lose the connection.
[67:46.66]Well, sorry the stream has been a just black screen, but thank you for coming out and hanging out for the hour or so, nonetheless.
[67:54.19]Dr. Steen, thanks for the $1.
[67:55.79]Failed streamer falsely advertised telephone stream and instead consumes boogers.
[68:07.02]Just imagine a world where that's on the front page of CNN.
[68:14.60]I would do anything to have CNN.
[68:18.77]That is the number one story.
[68:26.05]I wonder how much money you'd have to pay some rogue CNN employee to do that.
[68:35.10]Thank you, though.
[68:36.12]Thank you, Kyle99 for the $1.
[68:37.34]Do you know that a large YouTuber known as Pyrocynical is a big fan of yours?
[68:44.31]That's cool.
[68:47.85]I don't like... The thing about YouTube and YouTubers and large YouTubers, small YouTubers, I haven't really kept up with the YouTube crowd in a long time.
[69:01.38]But that's cool.
[69:12.17]Wasn't it a while ago?
[69:13.11]And I never even went through with it.
[69:15.73]Wasn't, wasn't somebody, wasn't this something, wasn't it like a podcast?
[69:19.81]Wasn't a fairly large YouTuber trying to get me to do, or not, no, not they weren't trying to, but wasn't there like a, I forget who it was.
[69:29.67]Critical?
[69:30.41]Critical?
[69:32.98]I don't remember.
[69:34.50]But it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a small world is what I was trying to say.
[69:48.53]That's cool, though.
[69:49.05]A little Pyrocynical if you're watching this.
[69:54.33]Hey, hey, what's up, man?
[69:58.86]And then he puts his hand up and like, yeah!
[70:00.80]Ow.
[70:02.12]Wow, that was a perfect clap.
[70:04.68]You know when you perfect clap and it hurts and you hurt your friend and your friend hurts you and all you want to do is show excitement and show that you're both happy?
[70:17.14]When did you get rid of the high five?
[70:19.62]Get rid of the high five and just have the double finger point.
[70:22.80]If you want to high five me, don't hurt me.
[70:25.49]Use your index finger, point it out.
[70:26.91]I point my out and we barely just touch our index fingers.
[70:29.71]Like, gotcha!
[70:32.99]Think of like the fusion dance from DBZ.
[70:35.35]But we don't turn our bodies strangely.
[70:38.05]Like we're doing the New World Order Scott Hall thing.
[70:42.84]No.
[70:43.38]I'm talking about just index finger out.
[70:45.78]Bang!
[70:46.72]Don't touch.
[70:47.56]Don't touch me.
[70:48.46]Don't touch me.
[70:49.20]Understand?
[70:53.80]Hey, Whatever Avenue, thank you for the five dollars.
[70:58.97]Been watching you since 2012.
[71:01.11]Me and my friends bonded watching memes die with our girlfriends on New Year's.
[71:06.69]Thanks so much for the years of laughs and continuing to keep me positive.
[71:11.39]I'm glad that you can enjoy that with your friends and your girlfriends.
[71:15.05]Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[71:26.56]Apple Cooler, thanks for the $1.
[71:27.88]With this being my birthday, thanks for keeping me, keeping this going for so long.
[71:32.14]I don't have many to talk to, so this is a treat.
[71:35.37]Apple Cooler, hop onto the Discord.
[71:39.97]There's a bunch of people in that Discord.
[71:43.17]Everybody's friends in the Discord.
[71:44.67]We're all friends here.
[71:47.33]Hop in the general chat and talk about memes.
[71:51.61]And talk about me.
[71:52.29]You know what I mean?
[71:52.95]Like, it's the Jerma Discord.
[71:54.53]You know, talk about me.
[71:55.96]Can we get some more conversations about me?
[71:59.42]Like, what did I do today?
[72:00.92]That was so funny.
[72:01.62]What did I say?
[72:04.68]No, it's a great little spot.
[72:07.82]Somebody want to shout out the Discord.
[72:08.98]Go ahead.
[72:14.30]Thank you for the $1, though, Apple.
[72:16.46]Much love to you.
[72:16.96]Thank you.
[72:18.42]Corn Monster, thanks for the $1.
[72:20.41]Are you implying that CNN wouldn't print a garbage story like that?
[72:31.76]CNN.
[72:35.76]What does CNN stand for?
[72:37.72]The Complete News Network?
[72:39.14]What does CNN stand for?
[72:43.33]The Complete News Network.
[72:45.75]CNN stand for.
[72:47.07]What does it stand for?
[72:51.36]The Cable News Network.
[72:56.56]Why does that sound like a terrible website?
[72:58.99]Why does that sound like a virus website?
[73:02.79]Please come to Cable News Network.
[73:07.13]We promise you won't get Melissa.
[73:13.69]That's an old one.
[73:17.99]Anybody else like back in the day?
[73:21.22]You guys remember that shit?
[73:28.71]What was I looking at?
[73:30.57]Oh, over here.
[73:32.75]Thank you to PIN for the $1 net neutrality.
[73:40.01]Net neutrality ain't gonna go through.
[73:42.43]That shit's not even gonna pass.
[73:44.03]It's gonna reverse.
[73:48.67]They gotta flip it.
[73:52.17]Look, here's how you fix this net neutrality thing.
[73:54.81]You reintroduce SOPA, but all these, like, idiot congressmen think that, like, SOPA's coming.
[74:00.83]Oh, yeah, SOPA.
[74:01.79]But in SOPA, you just redo net neutrality, and you make it a bunch of great shit for, like, an open and free internet.
[74:08.96]And then they just all sign it, and they think it's, like, SOPA again, and they... God, it's over.
[74:18.56]Just don't even... Just put the bill out for SOPA and just make it fake.
[74:21.20]Make the whole thing just great for us.
[74:23.50]They'll all sign it.
[74:24.18]They're all fucking dummies.
[74:31.39]Dr. Professor, thanks for the 50 cents.
[74:33.05]I never freeze.
[74:42.08]SOPA.
[74:44.70]What was the one before?
[74:45.76]SOPA.
[74:46.30]There was like SOPA...
[74:49.40]Piper, Supa, Boppa.
[74:53.62]They were like the seven dwarves of internet bills that were gonna kill the internet, right?
[74:57.96]What were they?
[74:58.36]What were the seven deadly internet dwarves?
[75:05.67]What were they?
[75:14.67]What were the seven deadly internet dwarves?
[75:18.59]Sopa?
[75:19.41]Bopa?
[75:23.31]Fupa?
[75:30.36]Fuck.
[75:31.70]I knew it was going to happen.
[75:32.86]Somebody was going to get it.
[75:34.74]Somebody got it.
[75:35.92]Somebody got it.
[75:36.62]That's alright.
[75:37.38]That's alright.
[75:38.04]Yeah, those fucking internet pills.
[75:40.58]Sopa, pipa, and fupa.
[75:46.62]Oh, that's making me laugh.
[75:48.16]It shouldn't be.
[75:53.37]That really shouldn't be making me laugh like this.
[75:55.27]God damn, it really shouldn't.
[75:57.31]What a child I am.
[75:59.19]Not a bunch of children.
[76:02.59]Thank you, though, to Dr. Steen.
[76:04.07]Self-centered streamer demands his viewers talk about him and him only.
[76:08.85]I didn't say me only.
[76:13.79]I just said me now.
[76:16.42]Grungo grango.
[76:17.50]Thanks for the five dollars.
[76:18.34]I've heard a good way to fix internet problems is to send a picture of a man With an elongated forehead to the provider what?
[76:28.66]What are you talking about What does that even mean T-dog the man thanks to the one dollar I bet chat can't sing three Everybody knows
[76:43.27]A cricket and some mistletoe.
[76:46.79]Another spirit's ride.
[76:53.48]And then the Christmas song you know and love would be playing in the movie theater now.
[77:04.16]Jay Pern, thank you for the $1.
[77:05.80]Yo, SOPA is cool, but have you heard about BOFA?
[77:08.77]I don't know.
[77:14.64]Is that like... What is that?
[77:16.38]Bank of fucking America?
[77:20.50]Have you heard of Bank of fucking America?
[77:22.12]No, I don't know.
[77:22.84]I don't know what that is.
[77:25.27]Jeebus, thanks for the $1.
[77:26.09]Jeremiah, I love watching your stream with my daughter, Alexa.
[77:29.63]However, recently she's been swearing and calling me a fat fuck.
[77:32.31]Please try to keep the swearing down.
[77:41.98]See, this is what I was afraid of.
[77:43.70]This is what I was afraid of.
[77:44.34]Somebody just came in here and absolutely, absolutely, it's a completely valid opinion.
[77:51.07]He said, why are you not playing the game?
[77:53.45]What am I doing?
[77:54.27]I'm so sorry to that person.
[77:55.89]I knew people were going to trickle in here and be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[77:58.80]Fuck this guy.
[78:01.32]My internet's fucked up.
[78:03.48]I can't stream a game right now.
[78:06.95]I'm so sorry that you stumbled into the stream.
[78:10.07]And you're like, yeah, I feel terrible about it.
[78:14.23]That's a joke?
[78:21.29]Where's the fucking game?
[78:25.82]What do you think?
[78:27.94]Were you trying to make a joke where I have an Alexa and I say my daughter Alexa and Alexa turns on and something funny happens on the stream?
[78:35.40]I don't have an Alexa down here.
[78:39.59]This is an empty room.
[78:42.21]I just, it's a painted room.
[78:44.57]I don't have any cool toys down here.
[78:46.11]Alexa, order tissues.
[78:57.14]Hold on.
[79:02.65]So some of you guys probably are watching me through like a TV.
[79:06.32]I might be loud enough and some of you statistically must have an Alexa right next to the TV.
[79:12.42]The way that I see you guys, I see you guys as like the multiverse or infinite alternate realities.
[79:17.32]So I could say... Ben Smith.
[79:20.92]That's somebody's first and last name.
[79:22.60]I just said it.
[79:23.18]There's infinite realities here.
[79:25.51]Somebody has a television with speakers and an Alexa sitting right next to it.
[79:28.93]We're in the alternate fucking infinite realities.
[79:33.57]So we can say, like, for instance, like, Alexa!
[79:37.45]Go to YouTube and play Rick Astley's Rick Roll song!
[79:42.29]And now you're gonna fucking think it's so funny, because, like, Rick Astley's never gonna play on your screen.
[79:47.54]Because that doesn't work like that.
[79:49.76]It has to be calibrated to your voice, not mine.
[80:02.98]Oh, what the fuck?
[80:03.94]No.
[80:06.42]I can't believe that happened.
[80:07.94]You played it.
[80:08.80]Haha, funny Rick roll.
[80:12.70]Wow, Rick, I said a Rick roll joke.
[80:18.40]God.
[80:21.52]2,000 people equals infinite realities.
[80:25.24]Okay, by a show of hands, you guys want to play this?
[80:27.82]Fine.
[80:29.42]Um...
[80:32.26]How many of you guys own a dachshund?
[80:35.86]Somebody does.
[80:37.62]Someone in our infinite realities owns a dachshund.
[80:40.16]Who does?
[80:40.48]Don't be shy.
[80:42.44]Okay.
[80:56.77]How many people in this chat drank a Yoohoo this afternoon?
[81:03.75]That is such a specific, odd thing.
[81:05.57]How many got, who's drinking a Yoohoo chocolate drink today?
[81:15.08]Nobody, nobody, no one?
[81:17.34]No one, huh?

[83:13.07]Yeah, I gotta change this.
[83:15.11]Is there just, like, is there a category on Twitch that's just, like, dog shit?
[83:19.43]So I don't have to go to the IRL category and anger everyone there?
[83:25.43]What can I even make this, like, is Black Screen a game on Twitch?
[83:32.67]They really should.
[83:33.33]They need to add a category on Twitch called Black Screen.
[83:36.29]Talk Show?

[84:14.59]Alright.
[84:14.93]We're almost an hour and a half into this here.
[84:18.01]And this is not happening.
[84:22.07]Who's the first guest?
[84:24.25]Me.
[84:32.12]Maybe I'll get better bandwidth if I stream on the Master of Comedy.
[84:35.70]No, I don't think that's going to work.
[84:43.00]Oh, now I'll be yawning.
[84:44.10]I just, okay.
[84:45.80]You guys ever see, uh... You guys ever watch Marvel Runaways?
[84:50.53]Or read the Runaways comic?
[84:54.23]I'm the girl that, I'm the girl that, like, goes crazy for five seconds and then goes to bed for four hours.
[84:59.57]And I just went crazy for an hour and 25 minutes and now it's time for bed.
[85:19.77]I'm the girl?
[85:24.33]What are we going to give away?
[85:25.55]Oh, so, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[85:27.27]No, no, no, no.
[85:31.59]Exactly.
[85:35.38]Whoops.
[85:35.70]Who the hell is that?
[85:38.02]Alright.
[85:39.08]Okay.
[85:40.92]Alright, everybody.
[85:43.47]I think the telephone stream is going to come to an end here.
[85:47.43]I wanted to at least go for like an hour or so at least and hopefully see if this was going to work.
[85:54.21]Nope.
[85:56.36]I wonder how bad this is going to look.
[85:57.80]Let's just see.
[86:03.00]How many frames did it drop in here?
[86:04.60]Just on like a video playing.
[86:07.36]This must be unbearable.
[86:16.16]Just try, try what?
[86:21.80]Don't hang up on us.
[86:23.94]Well, I'm going to get roaming charges.
[86:25.44]I've been on the cell phone roaming for an hour and a half.
[86:34.35]Okay, get ready for the next frame, everybody.
[86:36.55]Well, here's what we're going to do.
[86:38.72]Because my stream doesn't work.
[86:41.02]Is Italic still streaming?
[86:44.09]Our good friend gamers gamer descent boy Is he still streaming?
[86:49.91]I would assume he's probably still going for another like hour or two Let's go like let's go watch his stream I came in on a really weird moment there.
[87:06.14]Apparently Etalyx is having some fun He's having fun on stream
[87:12.69]Ran out of ideas.
[87:13.59]No, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I was delaying.
[87:18.67]Yeah, go, go to Etalyx' stream.
[87:21.08]I'm going to try again tomorrow.
[87:24.68]And if I, if it's, if the internet still doesn't look like it's going to work, then I'm, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[87:29.36]I have to get somebody to come down here again.
[87:32.82]So go tell Etalyx that his friend Jeremy boy says hello.
[87:40.76]Because now I'm just angry at this being an hour and a half into the stream and I've dropped almost 200,000 frames.
[87:48.17]How many frames?
[87:48.91]That means I've dropped 57% of every frame.
[87:51.67]That means I've streamed 400,000 frames just about.
[87:54.31]Half of them are gone.
[88:02.75]but twitch.tv/Etalyx let's just give you a link I'm gonna try again tomorrow I might I don't know when if I even if I don't I might not happen tomorrow I might take tomorrow as a um as a day to try as hard as I can to get somebody out here to fix it for Thursday we had things to play today too I want to play a couple of games go say hello sorry again I'm gonna try as much as I can I don't know I don't want to broken record this but
[88:31.49]Sorry for there being no real stream.
[88:35.59]Have a good night, everybody.
[88:37.37]Take care.
[88:38.97]Hopefully, I will see you on Thursday at the very latest, right?
[88:43.66]Good night, everybody.
