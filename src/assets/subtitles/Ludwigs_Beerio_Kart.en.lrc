[ve:61.1.100]

[00:09.61]I'm live.
[00:09.99]Hello, hello.
[00:11.25]Hello, hello.
[00:11.99]That's a lot of numbers.
[00:15.27]Hey, we're live.
[00:20.18]And one more big heart for Cadence, who gave us the technology to put all these game cubes together.
[00:24.78]I don't think it's to use it to drink a lot of beer in one sitting, but thank you, regardless, Nintendo, for also creating it.
[00:32.92]Anyway, let's take a look.
[00:35.05]What question did you ask me earlier?
[00:36.54]I asked you what the accelerate button was.
[00:39.99]Who's your teammate?
[00:40.74]You.
[00:42.46]Okay, let's go see how other people are doing.
[00:43.92]The format for this event is very simple.
[00:47.20]It's actually kind of complicated, so let me run through it.
[00:49.44]Basically, we are going to start with eight cars.
[00:53.51]There will be a person driving the car and then a person in the back throwing items.
[00:57.21]Okay, does that make sense?
[00:58.55]The person who is driving needs to finish their beer before the end of the race.
[01:02.41]The only rule is you cannot drink while driving.
[01:05.91]You have to be completely stationary.
[01:07.36]You can't be getting hit by a green shell, tumbling, and then start sipping.
[01:10.68]You can't be falling and getting picked up by Lakitu and then start sipping.
[01:13.87]You have to be stopped on your own volition, and then you can drink.
[01:17.71]Once you finish the race, whatever placing you get is the amount of points you get.
[01:21.11]And then we swap.
[01:21.87]The person in the back is now the driver.
[01:23.43]They have to do the same thing, and so you don't drink too many beers too quickly.
[01:27.23]That's the whole point of the teams.
[01:28.89]After the first round, we are going to split all 16 players into two heats of eight players, AKA four teams, four cars.
[01:36.77]So you'll only have to focus on four cars.
[01:38.29]It should be pretty easy.
[01:39.59]Aiden will go through it in a little bit.
[01:41.66]Basically, all you need to know is that every person here is expected to drink five beers
[01:46.44]They don't know this.
[01:47.10]If they win, they have to drink seven.
[01:50.28]I didn't tell them that yet.
[01:52.88]They'll be fine.
[01:53.66]They'll be fine.
[01:54.26]Seven in like 90 minutes isn't that bad.
[01:56.16]Mango Wednesday night stream.
[01:57.97]Come on.
[01:58.83]Nothing wrong with that.
[01:59.83]Anyway, that's about it.
[02:03.01]If you win, I'm fucked.
[02:04.73]This event will be big in the negative.
[02:07.69]I know that because I asked him to do a impression and he said, who's that?
[02:10.90]And then I session of the B from the... You're B right there.
[02:16.61]The mountains aren't blue yet.
[02:18.01]This beer is not cold enough for me to drink it.
[02:20.61]It's Michelob Ultra.
[02:21.27]It's not the Rockies one.
[02:22.59]Yeah, but the mountains aren't blue yet.
[02:26.49]Which one do you think are the mountains?
[02:28.90]It's right here.
[02:32.56]It's the letter M?
[02:33.62]It's mountainous, isn't it?
[02:35.62]It's a bit mountainous, perhaps.
[02:38.12]Are you sipping it right now?
[02:39.28]No, I just opened it.
[02:40.90]It's harder to chug a cold beer.
[02:42.31]You know that.
[02:43.63]Yeah, but it tastes better.
[02:45.35]You don't chug for taste.
[02:48.00]Everything is taste.
[02:49.06]Everything.
[02:49.74]You can't just chug.
[02:50.42]What do you mean, taste?
[02:51.08]This is a typical Golden Knights fan.
[02:54.56]They almost won the goddamn Stanley Cup the first year, by the way.
[02:58.40]How long ago was that?
[02:59.32]You drink.
[02:59.76]You can race, and you guys have to swap drivers because you're keeping the same controller, right?
[03:05.33]You both click Z. Both click Z at the same time to swap drivers for the next race.
[03:10.71]You do that at the beginning of the next race, okay?
[03:15.77]The countdown?
[03:17.43]You can't.
[03:18.98]You cannot, yeah.
[03:21.68]Sure.
[03:24.82]Hello, yes.
[03:28.78]Throw up.
[03:30.48]Please, please, if you're gonna throw up, do it not on the C9 trophies that are decorated.
[03:40.07]Do you guys have the trash in between you guys?
[03:43.01]You guys are too prepared.
[03:47.55]Alright, is everybody ready to get started?
[03:51.15]Everybody ready to get started?
[03:57.71]It's random for this.
[04:00.63]Alright, I need to start the game on this one.
[04:04.90]Is everybody ready?
[04:05.82]Because the way this works is everybody needs to click A to ready up in a 15-second window.
[04:10.92]Alright, three, two...
[04:15.04]no no no it's a twist off yes why would why would we buy cameras cameras still don't have my co-caster so wait welcome on welcome all to the beerio world cup uh I'm here with my co-caster aiden mckay a bunch of one directional turns and chomping a pretty broadway Jerma ludwig in fourth right now who's at the wheel for this first one I think it's ludwig drinking first
[04:46.24]Oh, they got booed on the line!
[04:47.46]They got booed on the line!
[04:49.15]Oh my god!
[04:50.71]They lose two places at the fucking line!
[04:52.95]I gotta get ready to snap the results pick.
[04:59.61]So the way the land mode works is it doesn't show you the results screen, which is just insane.
[05:07.76]Did we set the wrong amount of races?
[05:12.30]I see.
[05:12.80]I see what I'm doing here.
[05:15.71]Let's do this tomorrow.
[05:17.41]That was actually pretty swag.
[05:18.67]It's pretty swag, yeah.
[05:19.29]As someone who works at the company, finding out via Twitter that we're doing an event is actually insane.
[05:23.37]The beautiful part... The beautiful part about working in... Uh-uh.
[05:28.98]We got Wario Kart.
[05:34.26]Everyone going here.
[05:35.42]Sorry, going for a drink.
[05:38.80]Who's got their wings in first?
[05:39.98]Jerma and Ludwig in first place for the first time this day!
[05:42.56]Oh my god.
[05:44.53]You know what's crazy?
[05:45.19]They do kind of look like Wario.
[05:47.12]Oh, and a blue shell comes in.
[05:48.42]No way!
[05:49.46]Going for the jump.
[05:50.12]Jerma and Ludwig going for the boost.
[05:51.36]This might be a huge play.
[05:52.94]They need this item.
[05:53.94]They need a shell here.
[05:54.70]They need something massive.
[05:55.74]Oh, and they get a special.
[05:56.60]If they have good aim, they can make this work.
[05:58.42]They're going to have to throw that and get another item.
[06:00.66]Oh, they missed the item.
[06:01.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:01.98]But it might hit.
[06:03.48]Oh, they hit them.
[06:04.54]They hit them.
[06:05.60]No way.
[06:06.24]Oh, my God.
[06:06.68]It is neck and neck.
[06:07.66]Get them in the boost.
[06:08.86]Two items.
[06:09.22]They got to spam them.
[06:09.68]It doesn't matter because I'm the boost.
[06:10.54]Oh, it's a red shell.
[06:10.98]Oh, it's a red shell.
[06:12.34]Go, go, go, go!
[06:13.48]Oh my!
[06:17.98]He was cranking 90s when John Wick was new.
[06:31.83]I was showing them Ben chugging.
[06:36.27]Oh, okay.
[06:37.17]I wanted to show them the legend of Ben Tolson.
[06:39.07]Okay.
[06:39.39]Let's see.
[06:40.60]Lugwig...
[06:42.86]Do they have a chat-only mode?
[06:43.83]I guess you can just pause it.
[06:46.38]Alright, and we're off to the races, taking first place.
[06:49.68]They have a red shell, so if anyone passes them, they're probably going to retake first place pretty quickly here.
[06:53.50]Oh, just throws it, just chucks it back.
[06:56.18]Free.
[06:57.44]I feel like it's kind of an L getting rid of the red shell.
[07:00.40]We'll take on QT and Minx.
[07:01.40]Ludwig falling back into first place.
[07:02.62]Blue shell.
[07:03.12]Oh, blue shell, yeah.
[07:04.58]It seems like there's a lot more blue shells in this game type for some reason.
[07:08.07]Oh, but they have a red shell, it's fine.
[07:09.95]If you look at Peach, her special is a ring of hearts.
[07:12.51]You just get the item.
[07:13.23]It's actually very broken, especially for this.
[07:15.59]Wait, wouldn't Qtion go away?
[07:17.43]Qtion- Qtion- OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH,
[07:43.00]The last 30 seconds, items shouldn't spawn.
[07:45.74]Ludwig with a shy city reference that no one in his five-year-old audience is going to understand.
[07:49.01]I can say another thing in the mic.
[07:50.91]I just want to really, I just want to talk.
[07:53.29]Hey, how you guys doing tonight, you know?
[07:54.65]The man who made the adult.
[07:58.03]Oh, Jerma Ludwig getting hit by the blue shell.
[08:00.10]Classic Jerma Ludwig always getting hit by blue shells.
[08:02.26]Oh, man, they're always talking about.
[08:03.26]Whoa.
[08:04.04]Oh, and they get to take first again.
[08:06.68]They clutch it out with him.
[08:14.77]Unfortunately, we missed taking a photo of the results screen.
[08:17.64]A little bit cringe.
[08:22.17]Hey, while we're here, chat.
[08:22.97]If you have a... Oh, wait, I don't have this car.
[08:26.89]Hey.
[08:27.75]Not in this car.
[08:30.22]Hey, hope you guys are having a good time enjoying watching this.
[08:34.50]What is this, Bureaucart?
[08:35.62]This is Bureaucart.
[08:36.98]Is there, like, an official name, or is it, like, just... I should know that.
[08:40.92]I don't know it.
[08:41.36]I work here.
[08:41.82]I don't know that.
[08:42.60]It's the Bureaucart.
[08:43.54]I just work here.
[08:44.06]Sorry.
[08:46.73]Oh, it's the Bureau Carchella Palooza.
[08:51.41]The Lean Like a Cholo dance contest?
[08:53.25]Yeah.
[08:56.16]Winner gets a pair of oversized FUBUs and... And a 7XL Pro Club.
[09:02.06]You also get an Envy flip phone that comes with Lean Like a Cholo already installed.
[09:06.50]Ben Tolson somewhere is saying, on the wheel there, first, second, second, first.
[09:11.45]What?
[09:11.99]Mango and Josh having a strong running for first place here.
[09:15.31]Love to see that.
[09:15.93]Josh has to get on a plane after this.
[09:19.43]Yeah, he's going to house about nine beers and then get on the plane.
[09:24.93]Here's who's going to take second place.
[09:27.16]Because I think that Jeremiah Mango got this.
[09:28.80]I think Cutie and...
[09:32.72]Stanz and Yingling, Stanz and Yingling taking seventh.
[09:35.94]Jerma and Lud taking third.
[09:38.42]ConnorJoey fourth.
[09:41.96]Troy and Ted in fifth.
[09:44.58]Will and Myth.
[09:47.58]Cutie and Minx in seventh.
[09:50.48]And Toucan and Flex in last, unfortunately.
[09:55.89]Last is the new first.
[09:57.03]You got like fifth, man.
[09:59.53]Yeah.
[10:01.01]That's fast, baby.
[10:02.95]I'm excited.
[10:04.73]Can I get a hey, Peter?
[10:06.09]Hey, Peter.
[10:07.73]Hey, Peter.
[10:08.65]I have a poison for Goose Goat.
[10:10.85]Goose Goat.
[10:11.39]Oh, that's good.
[10:12.41]He's good at that.
[10:14.13]Yeah.
[10:14.89]He's kind of got the Seth MacFarlane voice.
[10:16.97]I thought I had it, and he had it more.
[10:20.64]You're...
[10:26.49]Show more Jerma.
[10:27.57]I'm asking for more of you.
[10:29.52]All of the chat.
[10:31.94]They want to see you.
[10:33.72]They want to see you get wet and wild.
[10:35.46]We got third place, which is awesome, because it's just enough of winning without any requirements of needing to perform at all.
[10:43.08]It's perfect.
[10:44.13]Second place, it's like, oh, you got second place.
[10:46.19]You're still, like, you could get first.
[10:47.97]Third place is perfect, because, like, who cares?
[10:50.57]We still get a trophy.
[10:54.75]We're just getting started, right?
[10:56.21]Yeah.
[10:56.81]Oh, never mind.
[10:57.33]Forget everything I just said.
[10:58.25]It's only just begun.
[11:00.49]Oh, perfect.
[11:01.11]Yeah.
[11:06.36]There's no waters for players.
[11:07.72]It's only Michelob Ultras.
[11:09.04]Yeah.
[11:10.36]Water of the gods.
[11:12.02]What do you have to say to the fans right now?
[11:14.20]To everybody telling you to floss on stream.
[11:16.74]Wait, people telling me to floss?
[11:18.12]Someone did.
[11:18.82]They keep saying hashtag myth floss.
[11:22.32]I will floss for you.
[11:23.24]I walked in and I was like, oh.
[11:24.30]I will floss for my people.
[11:25.20]Are there any wines?
[11:26.58]Do you have anything that's lighter than beer?
[11:28.73]And it's like, what are you talking about?
[11:30.93]It's in the name.
[11:31.79]And I'm like, oh shit, that's right.
[11:34.23]It does say beerio cart in the title.
[11:36.17]I was asking you, like, oh, is there, like, wine or any, like, you know, mixers?
[11:40.09]I'm just like, dude, it's fucking beer.
[11:46.09]The racers in half.
[11:47.93]That way you only have to consume four total cars.
[11:50.27]Keep your eyes on the... Mobile kill.
[11:53.69]You want me to test it?
[11:56.11]Aiden was an altar boy, and then the second one is that Jerma and Ludwig are commentating.
[11:59.53]This is you.
[12:04.07]Yeah, hop in, Jerma.
[12:06.66]Jerma I-95.
[12:07.22]Hey, that's me.
[12:12.22]Yeah, we can swap through which can we're going to look at.
[12:15.14]Yeah, yeah.
[12:17.85]Please do, please do.
[12:21.63]Going to sit here and drink a hot cup of Shida.
[12:25.01]I think of that so often.
[12:26.79]What, the guy doing that line?
[12:29.37]Yeah, from your original copypasta, yeah.
[12:31.01]Because that's literally the only thing that we gave people a package.
[12:34.28]Get closer.
[12:35.20]Get closer.
[12:35.68]No, no, you're good.
[12:36.30]You're good.
[12:37.32]No.
[12:37.72]So we gave people a package for what to listen to.
[12:40.98]Yeah.
[12:41.28]Like, oh, this is what, like, Jerma does.
[12:43.32]Dude, everybody just picked up on the, like, Minecraft copypasta thing.
[12:48.63]Because it's, like, the only monolog.
[12:50.83]Yeah.
[12:51.11]If you're an actor.
[12:52.51]It's the only thing that, like, you can really, oh, this is, like, a script, right?
[12:56.07]Right.
[12:56.49]Yeah.
[12:57.55]everybody's like, oh, hot cup of cider.
[12:59.07]I'm like, oh, hot cup of cocoa.
[13:00.63]And I'm just like, I haven't done that routine in like a decade.
[13:04.54]It's also hard to perform your mannerisms in a way on stage that's cohesive.
[13:08.56]Outsiders be like, and then you just, like, what then?
[13:11.56]You just leave the stage?
[13:12.46]I mean, that's kind of accurate, though.
[13:14.21]Like, oh, hey, look at me.
[13:16.57]it's loud sounds and arm movements yeah that's pretty much what I would and then and then you just do nothing and then you wait for the applause where where yeah where's the applause like rose clapping yeah yeah my whole career is alive no turn Jerma Jeremy you should get gotta bring it closer to the mouth closer like this closer to the mouth yeah right right are we good yeah that's great is this okay yeah good
[13:42.63]So anyway, just reiterating the rules for everybody at home.
[13:45.51]You just tuned in.
[13:47.21]Can we swap cam?
[13:48.17]Do we have a caster cam?
[13:51.07]We're on caster?
[13:53.35]Oh, it's paused.
[13:54.27]It just shows my ass saying it.
[13:55.61]Okay.
[13:56.35]That makes more sense.
[13:57.47]Do I look like a dickhead?
[14:01.17]Okay.
[14:01.57]Is there a four-person cam?
[14:02.73]Do we have that technology in?
[14:05.12]Okay.
[14:05.78]Sure.
[14:08.08]I can do that.
[14:09.41]Alright, so the way it's going to work here is we're reducing it from eight carts down to four carts.
[14:14.55]These are the first, I think, I don't know exactly how the seeding works.
[14:19.31]Yeah, how does a seed actually work?
[14:21.11]I think it's like one, four, five, eight is the way you're supposed to do it.
[14:25.77]And then we have like two, three, five, six.
[14:27.59]Oh, alright.
[14:28.19]Something like that, that you break it up.
[14:30.65]And they're going to do one whole Grand Prix.
[14:34.04]Really?
[14:34.88]So four races.
[14:36.06]So we have four full beers to chug.
[14:38.60]Between the two of us, though.
[14:39.86]Oh, okay.
[14:40.34]Alright.
[14:40.84]So they will each be consuming two beers per person in the next 12 minutes.
[14:45.66]Oh, okay.
[14:46.62]It's going to get a little spicy.
[14:48.42]It's going to get ugly.
[14:49.18]I think it's going to get ugly.
[14:50.08]There's some pro Mario Kart players in this event.
[14:52.48]His name's Troy.
[14:53.92]He's playing with Ted.
[14:56.30]He did not realize he would have to drink the beers.
[14:58.39]Oh, really?
[14:59.17]So he played in a beer cart event a couple weeks ago, and he was just a racer, and he had, like, a drinker.
[15:04.07]An assigned drinker.
[15:06.19]That's, yeah.
[15:08.41]Now you're in the thick of it here, right?
[15:10.27]You're in the thick.
[15:10.79]I mean, this is everything.
[15:11.73]Yeah.
[15:12.93]So let's start with we're going to sit next to us.
[15:15.57]Honestly, get it out of the way.
[15:17.09]That's what I feel.
[15:18.31]If you can, if you can handle it, if you can actually handle it, drink the beer first.
[15:22.94]You don't have to think about it.
[15:24.14]It's in the back of your mind.
[15:25.06]You don't care.
[15:25.44]You're just playing Mario Kart at that point, right?
[15:28.24]We started in seventh place, I think, every single race.
[15:33.10]But our beer was done.
[15:34.76]Is this technically competitive play?
[15:37.54]I don't know if that's entirely what we're doing.
[15:42.12]It's competitive, but is it competitive?
[15:44.30]I don't know if it's competitive play.
[15:45.96]Oh, yeah, it could be.
[15:46.94]I don't think I could do this every weekend, though.
[15:48.70]Really?
[15:48.96]And he goes, oh, just one or something.
[15:51.98]Well, like I said, when I walked in here, I'm like, oh, wow, cool, beerio card.
[15:56.07]I'm not a big beer drinker, so I don't really drink that much beer.
[16:01.91]I can do mixed drinks.
[16:02.73]I can do wine.
[16:03.63]Beer is tough.
[16:04.55]It sits in you for a while.
[16:05.23]You let him do that.
[16:06.01]I would have been allowed to do that.
[16:07.49]Really?
[16:08.11]We'll talk to the ref.
[16:09.21]Now, just to recap, everybody, that was first for Connor and Joey, the team from Trash Taste, second for Josh Mann and Mango, and then there's the other people that play.
[16:17.20]So now they're switching.
[16:17.92]Now they're swapping, yeah.
[16:20.48]Okay, they're swapping.
[16:21.14]Alright.
[16:27.65]Does it... Do you know who's drinking?
[16:30.23]Probably not.
[16:31.07]There's no way to know who's drinking or driving?
[16:33.73]It's unknown.
[16:34.87]It's one of those... There should be cameras pointed at every single seat.
[16:38.80]We... Every single one.
[16:41.62]We need a few more.
[16:42.56]I did turn this around a couple.
[16:44.18]There should be 60 cameras in here.
[16:46.08]We should have a GoPro strapped to the forehead of every player.
[16:49.13]A GoPro strapped to their hand with the beer on it.
[16:51.91]We should have a GoPro inside the beer in the POV in the mouth when you're drinking it.
[16:57.93]Oh yeah, that'd be great.
[16:58.85]That's what we need.
[17:01.17]Now, the way this heat works, only two will move on from this heat.
[17:05.40]Oh, okay.
[17:05.90]Totally separate from ours.
[17:07.34]So we gotta get in first or second place.
[17:09.22]In our heat, yeah.
[17:10.16]Alright.
[17:11.66]We're swapping drivers here.
[17:12.80]That'll be fucking easy.
[17:15.82]Troy and Ted, Toucan and Flexinja.
[17:19.73]They are on the chopping block, as it were.
[17:22.79]So you mentioned this before.
[17:25.05]This is one of only a few games that you could even do this with with the GameCube, right?
[17:28.77]Yeah, there's like four games total that you could even combine them with.
[17:32.73]They just kind of were like, alright, yeah, sure, why not?
[17:34.97]Alright, we're looking at Toucan.
[17:38.43]It's too hard to stop what you're doing and just drink a beer.
[17:41.32]It really is.
[17:42.32]And if you're in the middle of driving the car...
[17:45.74]you can't you're gonna drive off the road yeah the ones with no edges you're in a lot of trouble if you stop to drink a beer now I'm you'll go right off the edge yeah that's right wait wait this is they're they're communicating yep orange oh it's a political joke it's a political you know come on I missed it I missed it
[18:03.41]I just get a little political.
[18:04.39]I get a little spicy.
[18:05.53]I don't have any fear, okay?
[18:07.91]Wait, you can dodge with a punch?
[18:09.07]Oh, because it shifts the car.
[18:11.22]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[18:12.76]I've heard a few rumors.
[18:13.70]We've heard some pretty bad rumors about people not finishing their drinks before.
[18:16.96]You've got to... Wait, first in, last out?
[18:20.40]First in, last out.
[18:21.40]Yeah, yeah.
[18:22.19]Although in this case, not very good for them.
[18:24.29]No.
[18:26.51]You stay with that strat.
[18:28.05]Drink at the starting point.
[18:29.97]Yeah.
[18:30.35]Chug it.
[18:31.52]Even if it takes an extra five to ten seconds, just stay there.
[18:33.96]Now, I don't think that strat goes forever, though.
[18:35.62]You don't think so?
[18:37.02]What happens is, like... Oh, you might puke.
[18:38.98]I have two.
[18:39.38]I have two times that I can do that.
[18:43.10]If I do it a third, I will throw up.
[18:44.73]Yeah.
[18:45.49]So I can only force myself... I'm not even entirely sure I can do that a second time.
[18:49.69]Really?
[18:50.11]We'll find out.
[18:50.69]I feel like you can put him down.
[18:52.07]I can't.
[18:53.05]What's the most beers you've drank in a day?
[18:55.25]I don't drink beer.
[18:56.65]Uh, today.
[18:57.17]Like, in your younger years.
[18:58.90]When you were a spry young lad.
[19:00.26]Alright, when I was a sprout.
[19:03.40]Ah, beer.
[19:04.56]They are yelling.
[19:06.28]They're all upset because it's the same stage.
[19:07.74]When I was a young man, I would say probably, I don't know.
[19:11.38]I'm like, I'm small.
[19:12.54]I'm 5'7 on a rainy day.
[19:13.99]Yeah.
[19:14.37]You know what I mean?
[19:16.81]Like, maybe 7, 8.
[19:18.39]In a day?
[19:19.33]Maybe, yeah.
[19:20.75]That's not a lot.
[19:22.76]Yeah, I'm fucking 150 pounds.
[19:24.74]I'm not judging.
[19:25.91]I'm just saying, Jerma, I didn't tell you this part.
[19:28.55]If we move on to the finals, you have to drink two more beers.
[19:31.51]Okay.
[19:32.07]It's going to be seven beers today.
[19:33.91]Alright, so I lied.
[19:35.97]He lied to everybody.
[19:37.11]I lied to everybody.
[19:38.31]I didn't want them to know if you moved.
[19:41.03]Seven is a lot of beers.
[19:42.56]So we would drop.
[19:43.32]Seven is a lot of beers.
[19:44.78]Eight beers.
[19:45.28]I don't know if I could do eight.
[19:46.52]Seven is a lot for you?
[19:47.96]No, but I'm looking at everybody else.
[19:49.16]This is seven to this crowd.
[19:51.96]I drink like a cocktail and talk about like stocks.
[19:55.66]You're not going to make it, big guy.
[19:57.14]I don't chug beer.
[19:58.16]You're not going to make it.
[20:00.14]I sit around and I talk about like how the grass is growing and I have like a wine.
[20:06.14]You're like an old British man.
[20:08.20]Yeah.
[20:09.97]That's kind of how it is.
[20:11.55]Yeah.
[20:12.25]So my idea was like.
[20:14.23]Slamming beer.
[20:15.35]You do the drinking Grand Prix.
[20:16.65]You drink two beers per person.
[20:18.09]Yeah.
[20:18.49]You do the sober Grand Prix.
[20:19.59]You get a break.
[20:20.19]You do another drinking Grand Prix.
[20:21.63]You move on the top two from each heat to do one more drinking Grand Prix.
[20:25.12]I'll be alright.
[20:25.76]But maybe we just do one beer for the finals.
[20:28.10]I'm not a pivot.
[20:28.86]Hey, it's your rules.
[20:30.82]I can hang.
[20:31.88]I would feel bad if my rules result in three people throwing up.
[20:35.38]Two people I'm okay with.
[20:36.54]That's my line.
[20:37.78]But three is where it ends.
[20:39.16]Come on.
[20:39.86]Well, Cutie's a lock-in.
[20:40.78]She's a shoe-in.
[20:41.64]You think she's going to puke?
[20:42.36]For throwing up?
[20:43.08]Oh, come on.
[20:44.08]Oh.
[20:44.94]They brought a trash can next to them.
[20:46.78]We're sitting next to them.
[20:48.12]Yeah.
[20:49.48]I'm sitting within a foot and a half.
[20:51.82]People pay a lot for the Splash Zone, Jerma.
[20:55.03]What is this, a Galaga concert?
[20:57.55]It's SeaWorld.
[21:01.65]Look, hey, it's content, right?
[21:02.95]If I get puked on, I get puked on or whatever.
[21:04.99]Really?
[21:05.61]That's surprising.
[21:06.51]Dude yoga?
[21:08.04]This is on... And this is live on YouTube...
[21:14.84]Gantily clothed.
[21:15.74]But what you just described, you said, you said, hoo-ha.
[21:21.44]Well, as long as you don't get banned.
[21:23.78]Alright, so who we got?
[21:25.34]Top four?
[21:25.97]Top four to face the real top four, is what I'm understanding.
[21:29.07]We're in that one, by the way.
[21:30.05]Okay.
[21:30.89]So is this to move on?
[21:34.19]Oh, okay.
[21:35.19]You're in trouble.
[21:35.99]Backwards.
[21:36.98]I used to do that when it turned out.
[21:39.82]By the way, I don't really like Mario Kart.
[21:41.52]Let me be very honest.
[21:42.08]What?
[21:42.24]Because I think you're cool.
[21:45.09]I don't drink beer or play Mario Kart.
[21:47.67]Please call me.
[21:48.43]We can discuss Beethoven.
[21:50.92]But no, I don't really play that much Mario Kart.
[21:54.23]It is fun to watch.
[21:55.47]That's true.
[21:56.37]Very true.
[21:57.59]The games that I played recently, well, actually, I played Elden Ring.
[22:01.89]Back in place.
[22:02.62]Oh, yeah, the backwards thing, right?
[22:03.72]So anytime I would play this game and I would hate it.
[22:06.54]So I had more fun just turning around and trying to crash into Toad.
[22:11.02]Like just head on.
[22:12.16]Like at CPU Toad?
[22:13.72]Yeah.
[22:14.83]Yeah, you drove backwards.
[22:16.57]What happened there?
[22:17.19]Speak to me.
[22:18.29]There was a bunch of miscommunication, because I told Josh we should throw the blue shell and then drink.
[22:24.38]But then he didn't get the calm quick enough, so then he did it, and then I accidentally pushed Y again, and then I used the mushroom.
[22:31.30]What are these chumps that you still got second overall?
[22:35.39]You know what, Kai.
[22:36.13]Alright, alright.
[22:37.85]It feels like there's a clear top two in this round.
[22:43.09]Is that the last race?
[22:43.97]Driving backwards.
[22:45.07]One more.
[22:45.35]Yeah, what's his name?
[22:47.75]Lakitu would fly over and be like, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.
[22:50.99]He gets really upset.
[22:51.81]And I'm like, yeah, that's what I'm doing, Lakitu.
[22:53.23]Get out of the way.
[22:53.79]And you're just trying to ram Toad.
[22:55.29]I just was going for Toad only.
[22:56.47]Why Toad?
[22:57.17]Because I don't know.
[22:59.31]He was always up at the very end.
[23:00.41]He was always the easiest to find.
[23:01.43]Because he was bad?
[23:03.79]No, he was all the way at the very end.
[23:05.35]Right.
[23:05.63]He was so easy to find.
[23:07.40]Is the max joy you get the max speed hitting him?
[23:10.64]No.
[23:12.30]Is it like the most damage to Toad?
[23:14.42]I mean, now that you mention it, that's a little strange, right?
[23:16.80]It is.
[23:17.20]But yes.
[23:18.36]To be clear, it's very strange, Jerma.
[23:20.16]It was just fucking Toad.
[23:21.36]Fuck Toad.
[23:22.08]Like, I'm losing.
[23:23.62]I never played 150cc.
[23:25.50]I was a 100cc guy.
[23:27.12]Jerma, you're telling me you booted up Mario Kart Double Dash by your own lonesome self as a teenager.
[23:33.12]Sure, yeah.
[23:34.04]You would turn around, ignore Lakitu's grave warnings.
[23:38.46]Very, very major instructions.
[23:40.28]Incessant warnings.
[23:40.88]Incessant warnings.
[23:42.00]Try to max speed, hurt, and kill Toad.
[23:45.11]Yes.
[23:45.43]How do you feel, Joey?
[23:47.63]I'm feeling good.
[23:48.17]Only when I was losing.
[23:49.39]I'm not feeling good.
[23:50.17]You're not feeling good?
[23:51.17]Oh, no.
[23:51.69]It's three beers, or did you have to do your third?
[23:54.01]No, I've done three.
[23:55.13]Okay.
[23:56.40]I mean, you're doing well.
[23:57.20]It seems like you're clearly top two in this.
[23:59.02]I mean, can we actually play real gamers?
[24:01.60]Okay, a lot of smack talk here.
[24:03.28]That's a lot of smack talk.
[24:04.00]That's smack talk.
[24:04.94]Wow.
[24:07.61]But to be fair, it was only when I was really losing the game.
[24:10.71]Oh, like when there's no chance you could win?
[24:12.23]If I'm in first place and I get, like, blue shelled and I'm back down in eighth place and there's no way I'm going to win, it's like I don't even want to try anymore.
[24:18.36]I'm just turning around and I'm just going to drive into Toad.
[24:23.20]It's weird, incredibly weird.
[24:24.20]Let me preface that.
[24:25.48]But it's almost healthier that you're taking it out on a CPU than taking it out on, like, some people take it out on their controller, like the physical Pro.
[24:32.53]Let me make this very, very clear.
[24:34.53]I do not break controllers.
[24:35.97]I do not punch walls.
[24:38.19]I just drive into Toad.
[24:40.24]Okay.
[24:41.08]So, look, if that's how I did it, I do not break anything.
[24:45.94]It's my stuff.
[24:46.74]I don't want to break my controller.
[24:47.84]It's a good controller.
[24:48.62]I don't want to break it.
[24:49.72]Okay, you have a terrible week.
[24:50.90]Just go load it up and just drive into Toad.
[24:55.72]What a rough week, man.
[24:56.86]I'm just going to load up Mario Kart and just drive the other way into Toad.
[25:01.08]I can't say I've ever done that, but the thought is interesting.
[25:05.48]Oh, they're not doing the wheelie.
[25:06.56]Alright.
[25:07.14]That's game over, right?
[25:08.04]No, they haven't.
[25:08.56]Let's grab two people now.
[25:10.14]Two.
[25:12.22]Oh, that's bad.
[25:13.96]What?
[25:14.23]That was weird.
[25:15.41]That was kind of strange.
[25:16.55]It went backwards and then backwards again.
[25:18.73]So it's random cars, random characters.
[25:21.59]It looks cool.
[25:22.93]It's awesome.
[25:23.97]It's the Waluigi Batmobile.
[25:25.21]It's amazing.
[25:26.79]This course kind of looks like it sucks.
[25:28.73]Yeah.
[25:29.65]What is that?
[25:30.37]I hope we don't do this one.
[25:31.59]They're still in first place.
[25:32.78]They're still in first place.
[25:33.86]They were so far ahead.
[25:35.12]Now the problem is, Connor, they'll eat everything.
[25:38.42]That'll get them ahead a little.
[25:39.60]That's just too good.
[25:41.48]They understand.
[25:42.12]They understand the game very well.
[25:45.18]Let's go.
[25:45.86]They're in place.
[25:46.90]I hope that doesn't happen to us.
[25:48.22]And let me just say, Ludwig, if we're in last place, I'm sorry.
[25:50.64]I apologize in advance.
[25:51.56]Jerma, you could never do wrong to me.
[25:53.74]Never.
[25:55.81]Can you get Nick Yingling away from us?
[25:58.25]He's heckling us the whole time.
[26:00.45]He's heckling, dude.
[26:01.36]How many shells?
[26:02.00]He's heckling.
[26:02.62]Like four blue shells.
[26:04.02]And then I'm like, they're going to pass us.
[26:05.36]It's over.
[26:06.96]We are now switching heats.
[26:08.26]Sit down and air the grievances.
[26:09.60]That was just the first.
[26:10.86]Can we just get more?
[26:12.76]We drink more beer.
[26:13.54]You want to drink more?
[26:14.12]You want to hop on commentary?
[26:15.03]Let's play now, yeah.
[26:15.63]Alright.
[26:16.73]Josh Mann and Connor are going to hop on commentary right here.
[26:19.31]I'm going to play melee with Manko.
[26:20.55]Okay.
[26:22.66]Hell yes.
[26:23.40]Nice to meet you, Ted.
[26:24.14]Nice to meet you, Connor.
[26:25.25]Okay.
[26:27.67]Okay.
[26:28.01]Wow.
[26:32.28]It's a great time.
[26:33.34]What do you do?
[26:34.02]What I do?
[26:34.94]I just drink beer.
[26:35.66]Okay, so that's great.
[26:36.66]No, actually, that's perfect.
[26:38.04]You know, this is actually the perfect event for that.
[26:41.36]So who's competing in this one?
[26:42.56]We have Myth and Will.
[26:43.68]We have Cutie and Minx.
[26:44.60]Jemma and Ludwig and Yingling and Stanz.
[26:46.84]Okay, yeah.
[26:47.48]So that's going to be an exciting one.
[26:48.64]We've got a lot of big competitors.
[26:51.14]Yeah.
[26:51.88]They were sitting here in the little office.
[26:55.08]You can see them over there.
[26:56.79]They look like too low.
[26:59.81]Lost lost kids at the I don't know like fucking this is like when my dad just take me to the football games When I was young and I didn't know why everyone was drunk.
[27:07.99]I didn't understand what was happening Yeah, they're like kind of they look like like two little lost kids that were exactly left them in a mall Who do you think it's gonna take it this one if you had to I think it's gonna take this one Um, you know I'm gonna have to put my money on myth and will
[27:24.63]You think so?
[27:25.11]They were kind of struggling in the heat, though.
[27:27.57]Because I love Will Neff.
[27:29.29]There's none more in this world that I love than Will Neff.
[27:31.95]I'm looking at him right now.
[27:32.91]I will say, it seemed like Yingling and Stans were killing it in the heat, though.
[27:36.02]You know, here's the thing.
[27:37.28]I was just chugging beers.
[27:39.26]I even got a burp coming up right now.
[27:41.08]I've been burping the entire time we've been here.
[27:42.78]Yeah.
[27:43.36]I'm basically the mayor of Burp City.
[27:47.00]Oh, wow.
[27:48.50]Is that in Ohio?
[27:50.10]Yeah.
[27:50.89]It's funny you say that.
[27:51.93]No way.
[27:52.27]Yeah.
[27:54.37]So, yeah, no, I'm putting my money on Myth and Will just because... Obvious that Yingling and Stanz are a formidable duo.
[28:01.13]They've been pulling in some big first places, but you can't ever count on Cutie and Mix, right?
[28:04.97]Maybe they'll be sick, and it'll distract everybody, and that'll be a big win.
[28:09.14]They may start projectile vomiting all over the place.
[28:13.38]Like, imagine this.
[28:14.18]I mean, that's what vomit is.
[28:15.48]It's full of bile.
[28:17.40]You know, if they start going kind of like a dinosaur in the original Jurassic Park where it spits ass at that guy...
[28:24.28]Jerma is gonna win.
[28:26.00]I hope so.
[28:26.80]But I don't want Ludwig to win.
[28:27.96]But I would love to see Jerma win.
[28:30.01]Which is unfortunate because they're on a team together.
[28:32.16]Let me just clarify what I was saying, though, about the dinosaur.
[28:34.44]Okay, go ahead.
[28:34.90]The dinosaur shoots poison at, uh... What?
[28:37.85]I'm pretty sure it's a human from Seinfeld, although... The point being is that the projectile vomit cannot be a factor that you don't account into this race.
[28:47.66]Yeah, I know.
[28:48.76]You have to factor in the projectile vomit because it's what is going to... You just don't know.
[28:53.50]You don't know what could happen.
[28:54.26]If you get that in your eyes, you're losing your retinas, you're losing your vision, you're losing your beard skills.
[28:59.37]I'm I'm I'm a firm gamer right nothing want me to look away from the screen I could uh when you want it's acceptable you know I I assume so at least one I don't know he did um well I've been losing a lot um yeah how how was your racing was it good did it go well um it was going you know it was going a little wrong yeah alright it looks like they're going in
[29:27.16]and just like that it looks like yingling stands one and Jerma is this Jerma ludwig pull a second up hard and Jerma and ludwig seem to be have been hit with a uh
[29:41.91]You know the flippy boys a little bit of a reality check.
[29:44.23]That's all I got to say Now we got Jerma Ludwig and feel good being the other races knowing that fourth place is already secured Followed by myth and will and Jerma Ludwig and QB mix at the same time Okay, so we'll seem to be catching up and second because it's baby pop just for babies.
[30:00.36]It's for little children Just right in the back we got Mario stupid
[30:08.44]Mario and Donkey Kong, historically enemies, and now they're joining together.
[30:13.99]And in the same way, I mean, everybody knows the lore.
[30:16.29]I mean, Jerma and Ludwig have hated each other for years until they joined together, only for the sake of content.
[30:22.70]Strongest item in this game, and if you can get a star, it is just a massive G.
[30:27.10]everybody knows that the shell is that going to do anything I'm okay thank you um alright so they are in a really comfortable spot right now but this will do it and cutie makes placings but you know luckily myth and will redeem themselves this time getting a second surprised health like I don't know what have you what have you been placing up until now because this show inside was getting first and second we were battling back that's that's top three and four
[30:51.81]okay this looks like she's faltering but she's doing it the other boys have finished checking their b before they even even made a 10 time so it looks like oh my god the beer fell down oh my god beer is everywhere beer is getting spilled all over the ground knocked out knocked out two people into dude uh through that
[31:14.23]They there.
[31:14.73]But it looks like Gingling and Stanz and Ludwig are gonna take this one again.
[31:17.55]Grabs at this point.
[31:18.33]Lerma and Judd.
[31:19.23]Jerma and Lerma.
[31:20.49]Jerma and Ludwig and Gingling.
[31:21.59]Look at those, man.
[31:22.32]Those are some... Oh, and a blue shell just interrupts.
[31:26.14]Oh, the lightning bolt.
[31:26.96]That's gotta feel good if you're Jerma and Ludwig right now.
[31:29.04]Reminds me of my childhood.
[31:30.46]great in New Hampshire and the track start great okay they just really can't get on this track yeah they're selling because they're inting hard right which likes to say uh so far ahead right now this is impressive and ludwig are really taking it to town it's almost like they're losing it's almost like this is ludwig's dream oh oh
[31:51.60]The hole of the desert or a yingling.
[31:54.85]But QT and Mixer are never in the same zone, if we'll be honest here.
[31:57.91]The beautiful thing about Mario Kart is when you're in the front, you're that far ahead.
[32:01.45]But it looks like they're BMing.
[32:04.11]They just won.
[32:04.81]They're BMing real hard.
[32:06.67]I thought that they were actually in a worse position than they actually were.
[32:10.38]You have to respect the BM.
[32:11.78]That's worth style punts.
[32:12.98]You can't deny that.
[32:15.06]Just amazing.
[32:16.14]Game sound is pretty loud.
[32:17.26]Alright.
[32:24.11]Cutie, could you come over here?
[32:26.31]Come over here.
[32:28.79]Alright.
[32:29.21]So, Cutie, what's the deal here?
[32:32.13]Rumor has it you up-chucked some beer like you were a sprinkler on a white person's lawn.
[32:38.68]You want to break that down for me, Barney style?
[32:41.26]So, here's the deal.
[32:42.32]I chugged my beer.
[32:44.06]It came out my nose and then came out of every crevice I own.
[32:48.52]And I'm... Minute drinking break?
[32:50.35]Right.
[32:50.63]Recalibrate.
[32:51.19]I'm curious...
[32:53.57]When the algorithm is on, they're $2,000.
[32:54.99]I get ads for them all the time.
[32:56.72]I like the Wish version.
[32:57.74]So I rode a similar model at Carl's.
[33:00.92]They're electric.
[33:01.60]They're phenomenal.
[33:02.36]I mean, they go pretty fast, and they're very, like, low center of gravity, so you can, like, fucking whip it.
[33:07.73]Oh, really?
[33:08.19]Yeah.
[33:08.51]I live on a cul-de-sac, and I want to just, like, do some donuts.
[33:10.53]You could do that.
[33:11.19]Okay.
[33:12.03]So I think they'll be a lot of fun.
[33:14.13]I had a vision of having them here, but I was like, that's a mistake.
[33:16.57]Yeah.
[33:17.13]I don't think so.
[33:18.12]Well.
[33:18.60]Could you imagine?
[33:20.59]Yeah.
[33:22.31]I heard the beard came out of your nose.
[33:25.07]My bad.
[33:25.77]To punch the person next to you.
[33:27.71]And Mango punched Connor and Joey.
[33:30.03]Did you see that?
[33:30.81]Yeah.
[33:31.57]That was me.
[33:32.79]That was you?
[33:35.07]You're the fucking goat.
[33:36.40]You're the fucking goat.
[33:37.42]That was nasty.
[33:38.16]That was nasty.
[33:38.90]You're nasty.
[33:41.52]That was an unbelievably good shot.
[33:43.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:43.62]I was sick in the building for that.
[33:44.90]I've never seen anything that fucking crazy.
[33:46.94]Holy shit.
[33:47.42]That was the hypest Mario Kart moment.
[33:48.76]Yeah, yeah.
[33:49.36]The shortcut and lightning was sick too.
[33:50.86]Trash Chase!
[33:52.72]I almost said Japan, but I felt like I was racially charged.
[33:55.88]I've never seen something so insane in my life.
[33:58.24]It's sober.
[33:58.70]This is a sober gram.
[33:59.74]No.
[33:59.90]Oh, alright.
[34:01.32]It's random for Joey.
[34:03.87]One of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my life.
[34:06.13]Not a great pre from the Trash Boys.
[34:08.27]I was in the bathroom.
[34:09.85]That was a mix-up.
[34:10.65]Yeah, yeah, that was surprising.
[34:11.85]That was their first win of the day.
[34:12.97]Clearly, Gore first.
[34:14.11]Yes.
[34:14.49]But sex, totally different.
[34:15.73]Yeah, it could be anywhere.
[34:16.77]I think we're getting called up.
[34:17.63]We're hopping in, boys.
[34:18.39]We're going to swap out commentators.
[34:19.71]I think, ultimately, we got first seconds, but we got two-thirds there.
[34:23.38]That was kind of sad, but we got two firsts.
[34:25.54]Yeah, we got some two-thirds.
[34:26.68]Both of the times I was driving, by the way, just letting you know.
[34:28.70]Oh, wait, wait, no.
[34:32.57]I think it's- I think yeah I think we've definitely qualified.
[34:35.00]I think so.
[34:36.00]I think we won a good chunk of the races. So that should be fine.
[34:40.00]Alright uh welcome to the Trash Taste stream everyone.
[34:42.00]Let's see what's going on. Okay so next up we have the sober race as you just saw which honestly feels- as good chugging- bat.
[34:49.00]Because I was- I was watching them earlier. The problem was was that they were really good at races but the problem was was that they weren't chugging right at the beginning.
[34:56.00]They were chugging right before the finish line.
[34:59.72]Yeah, and also their racing wasn't a bin, I think.
[35:01.56]They were doing a lot of like micro drifts though, from what I saw.
[35:04.56]So that was a good strat.
[35:05.84]You know, Jerma and Ludwig are looking really clean.
[35:07.46]I know they're a fan favorite.
[35:08.74]People want to see Jerma and Ludwig go at it.
[35:10.40]Obviously.
[35:10.80]And just win.
[35:11.59]But Yingling's stands are also very good.
[35:13.25]And now QD and Minx are here for comedic support.
[35:15.73]You know, I mean, spewing the beer everywhere.
[35:18.25]Just really having a great time.
[35:19.65]That was hilarious.
[35:20.39]Yeah, right?
[35:21.03]So it should be fun.
[35:22.41]We have... What map's up first?
[35:23.88]Is it the same cup, right?
[35:25.12]The same cup we just did?
[35:25.86]Same cup, I believe.
[35:26.60]Okay, cool.
[35:28.02]So yeah.
[35:29.59]I'm going through it now.
[35:30.55]It's going to be fun.
[35:31.79]You guys know we're swapping through everyone.
[35:33.87]I'll go on them.
[35:34.45]Sure.
[35:36.56]Man, I'm excited.
[35:37.20]Who do you think is going to take the first race?
[35:39.06]It's hard to say.
[35:39.82]I think because the chugging aspect has disappeared now, I think Myth and Whirl are probably going to unlock their abilities.
[35:46.61]You say that, but I saw them slipping.
[35:47.99]They were driving off the course quite a lot, a worrying amount.
[35:51.11]I think the problem is that they were kind of getting shit rankings earlier because the strike, everyone just passed by them, right?
[35:56.69]So I think now they're drivers.
[35:58.43]Really nice drifts.
[35:59.51]If they get a good cart, it could be it.
[36:00.99]That could be the deciding factor.
[36:01.97]Definitely, definitely.
[36:02.73]So I guess we'll find out who's going on.
[36:04.03]They're about to start, right?
[36:05.08]We're going to win.
[36:07.68]Strong words.
[36:08.42]Strong words from Gemma.
[36:09.34]If you don't, Gemma, I'm going to be severely disappointed.
[36:12.02]Can you repeat back what I said?
[36:15.21]We're going to win.
[36:15.83]You guys heard it here.
[36:18.15]If they don't win, they're liars, and your streamer will be a liar.
[36:20.77]Alright, here we go, guys.
[36:22.79]They're booting up right now.
[36:23.69]Alright.
[36:24.55]And the first course is, what was it again?
[36:28.31]It's the car driving around the city.
[36:32.49]Oh, oh, Mushroom Bridge.
[36:33.61]Mushroom Bridge.
[36:34.19]Yeah.
[36:34.53]Bro, I'm three beers down.
[36:35.47]I can't think straight.
[36:37.11]I'm just getting started.
[36:37.95]This is great.
[36:38.45]It's three in the afternoon.
[36:40.14]Yeah.
[36:40.36]Alright, Ludwig and Jim have got Peach and Daisy.
[36:42.80]Is this fate?
[36:44.88]Ooh.
[36:45.02]That means, though, that they only have one special.
[36:47.58]Oh, Stanzalinga got it.
[36:48.58]How did they do it?
[36:49.14]I don't even know how.
[36:49.60]Oh, my God.
[36:50.18]Okay.
[36:50.34]Well, they're first.
[36:50.90]Alright, first, first, first.
[36:51.68]GermanLotto just stole first place away from them, and Yunling and Stanz are third place.
[36:55.42]No, fourth now.
[36:56.26]Everyone's very close right now.
[36:57.44]This is neck and neck.
[36:58.08]Everyone's very close.
[36:58.88]Myth and Will, fourth.
[37:00.13]They're coming up really fast.
[37:01.69]I think Myth and Will have a heavy card.
[37:03.59]I've used that card.
[37:04.27]It's not fun to use.
[37:04.97]It's not a great card.
[37:05.55]So it's going to be.
[37:06.09]GermanLotto just got hit and pushed into third place, but they're fighting back, and it looks like Myth and Will are back.
[37:11.55]And GermanLotto just stole first place.
[37:12.97]Straight down to fourth.
[37:13.77]Everyone is so close with this one.
[37:15.27]How do they do it?
[37:15.97]It's anyone's game.
[37:16.61]It's the sisters.
[37:17.49]You know, it's the girl power.
[37:18.54]It's getting them through it.
[37:20.34]But unfortunately, the bad thing about having both the sisters is that you only get one special.
[37:24.58]The special is good, but it's not going to be a game changer.
[37:26.94]Exactly, exactly.
[37:27.83]Oh, Yingling and Stance just fucked up.
[37:29.35]Oh my god, QT and Minx stole second, but Jermyn... Yo, what the fuck just happened?
[37:37.75]One of the consoles has any, like, wire malfunction.
[37:41.31]Crashes.
[37:41.79]You turn it off.
[37:42.60]The whole race ends.
[37:44.36]So we have to start the whole race again.
[37:45.62]Alright, starting again.
[37:47.56]And it's good that it took a while.
[37:48.88]We went through four pre's without it happening.
[37:50.60]Well, you guys hit it.
[37:52.34]That was a nice warm-up for the entire time.
[37:54.58]That could have gone anywhere.
[37:56.32]I think?
[37:56.72]You got a Koopa and a Daisy.
[37:58.38]Ooh, they have a baby, so they have the Chomp Chomp and the big shell.
[38:00.93]This is kind of a bad combination, but they have a light car, which is good.
[38:03.73]Yingling and Stanz have Mario and Daisy.
[38:05.67]Oh, Myth and Will have the two Koopas.
[38:07.05]And Cutie and Minx have Birdo and Waluigi, which is an okay combination.
[38:10.19]It's not the best.
[38:10.99]But Jerma and Ludwig are doing okay.
[38:12.37]And Jerma and Ludwig are just looking at their behind, hoping to get a box that can help them get into first place.
[38:17.68]And they get a red shell.
[38:18.80]Everyone is very close right now.
[38:20.32]And it's hidden to the wall anyway, and Jerma and Ludwig... Oh my god!
[38:23.12]oh my god this is neck and neck at this point and cutie and minx are Jerma letter just got hit the bridge strut but Jerma letter gives a red shell to hit yingling incentive in first place right now this is insane oh and they hit the car let me just hit another nation
[38:39.34]That was an absolute upset.
[38:42.72]How do you feel, Trevor?
[38:44.28]Well, I got to say, we were in the lead in the first race.
[38:47.26]Yeah, I feel like you got rocked a little bit.
[38:50.22]And we got a little rocked.
[38:52.08]I think there might have been a little bit of sabotage potentially in this.
[38:55.06]It seemed that when you ran into the back of that car, that really kind of messed you up.
[39:00.04]I don't think so.
[39:01.28]That's called a pro gamer move in Wisconsin.
[39:03.22]I don't think it was me driving into two different cars.
[39:05.12]I think it was the fact that we were in the lead in the first race.
[39:09.48]And we got unplugged.
[39:10.86]It seemed that they might have sabotaged you a little bit.
[39:14.15]Yeah.
[39:14.39]It seems like it.
[39:15.13]Don't want to make a drama fuel.
[39:18.09]No, it's definitely not.
[39:18.93]No.
[39:22.21]Our TV turned off four times.
[39:23.70]Eamon's back there fucking pulling the plug because we're too... So, yeah, what happened when you ran into that wall and just... Yeah, what happened... So why were they... What happened there?
[39:33.18]Can you explain what happened?
[39:34.14]He said the CRT's broken.
[39:36.02]Damn.
[39:36.22]Yeah, so we're doing a swap.
[39:37.62]It's kind of like a God divine intervention.
[39:39.92]Yeah.
[39:40.20]Trying to even the playing field because you guys are snaking like crazy.
[39:42.96]No, he is snaking like crazy.
[39:44.24]I'm terrible.
[39:44.82]No one is doing this.
[39:45.76]No one is snaking.
[39:46.60]Mango is snaking.
[39:47.92]Barely.
[39:48.32]I mean, like a drunk.
[39:49.69]He's so bad.
[39:50.85]Okay.
[39:51.49]Have you ever peed while driving?
[39:53.55]No, never.
[39:54.39]I've shit myself while driving.
[39:56.25]I will hand the mic to you for the rest of the night.
[39:59.00]Alright, anyway.
[40:00.52]So they're replacing some CRTs.
[40:03.55]Don't worry about it.
[40:04.19]How did you shoot yourself while driving?
[40:05.95]Yeah, can you tell us how you shoot yourself while driving?
[40:07.49]I was coming back from university, and I had really bad diarrhea, and then I hit a speed bump a little too hard, and I shit myself.
[40:15.96]Was anybody in the car?
[40:17.70]No, it's just me.
[40:19.82]But it was my mom's car, and she wasn't happy about that, so... You just said something that was between you and God to 32,000 people.
[40:28.58]Yeah, but you did this with the subathon, didn't you?
[40:30.98]I make myself come on command.
[40:32.78]It's impressive.
[40:34.26]What are you, Johnny Sins?
[40:35.36]What do you mean?
[40:37.60]Wait, hold up.
[40:39.04]Explain.
[40:41.64]What do you think about it?
[40:42.87]Alright, anyway...
[40:45.24]Don't worry about it, Gemma.
[40:45.92]Good luck.
[40:46.22]Good luck, Gemma.
[40:46.66]Don't worry about it, Gemma.
[40:47.44]We want to see you win.
[40:48.12]We want to see you win, Gemma.
[40:49.28]We're team Gemma over here.
[40:50.34]Alright, here we go.
[40:51.02]Second race.
[40:52.62]Alright.
[40:53.24]Who have they got?
[40:54.02]Okay, they have Cooper and Daisy.
[40:55.16]That's a solid combination.
[40:56.20]That's a solid combination.
[40:57.48]Gemma, they got on their tail.
[40:59.42]This is so close.
[41:00.47]Everyone is just neck and neck right now.
[41:02.05]They threw the red shell too early.
[41:04.11]Is this amateur?
[41:04.75]Oh, but the drift is so much better.
[41:06.23]Oh, the drift!
[41:06.61]They dropped the red shell somehow.
[41:08.77]How did they do that?
[41:09.51]Green shell, can they?
[41:10.49]Oh, my God.
[41:11.43]They got hit.
[41:11.99]They got hit.
[41:12.41]Right on their tail.
[41:13.43]Oh, but they fall off the truck.
[41:14.93]Everyone is so close.
[41:15.71]But Jerma Ludwig with the green shell are catching up right now.
[41:18.11]This is looking good.
[41:19.09]Second lap.
[41:19.91]Surprisingly.
[41:20.61]Oh, they got hit by a blue shell.
[41:22.25]Coming around to second.
[41:23.15]There's Jerma Ludwig catching up.
[41:24.57]This could be bad if they rip the rock.
[41:26.87]Right item they just take over because they're so shit at this and the drift is what a cutie a mixture A lot of micro boosts right?
[41:34.79]Yeah, this is great.
[41:35.53]Just what you need on this and they are taking the puff the right item It's like this that this is just beta moves.
[41:40.14]This is not a Sigma male with mushroom And cutie of minks and sick with the red shell with the rationale here we go.
[41:46.70]Is it gonna connect connect?
[41:47.68]Oh
[41:48.38]Oh, it doesn't connect, and it hurts them.
[41:51.36]But Jerma and Ludwig, they're getting distance.
[41:53.26]This is big.
[41:54.06]If they don't fuck up, oh, but they fuck up!
[41:57.27]This could be bad.
[41:57.83]This could be bad.
[41:58.67]Here we go with a red shell.
[41:59.59]No, coming in.
[42:00.05]No, Jerma and Ludwig are going to take it.
[42:01.57]Jerma and Ludwig with Mario and Luigi, that's bad.
[42:04.39]Oh, that's a bad.
[42:05.05]That's a two.
[42:06.35]With Birdo and Daisy, which is solid.
[42:08.59]That's solid.
[42:09.03]Smash right there.
[42:10.29]It looks Jerma Ludwig smack right into the tables and a bad angle of attack here.
[42:13.96]But QT and Jerma Ludwig just threw a blue shell and now it's going to be getting really good items.
[42:18.38]They're just eating shit.
[42:19.24]They're in fourth row.
[42:20.20]Clemings are catching up.
[42:21.60]Jerma Ludwig are eating absolute shit in the end.
[42:24.64]Hit it with the blue shell right here.
[42:26.12]Not looking in a great position right now.
[42:28.12]It is not good, dude.
[42:30.30]Oh, maybe the lightning will do something to them.
[42:32.18]Table right here.
[42:32.78]Oh, double table.
[42:33.94]Oh, that's not good.
[42:34.90]That's not good.
[42:36.39]Alright.
[42:37.13]I think it's safe.
[42:37.75]God!
[42:39.99]Here comes the final- Oh god, they're shouting.
[42:42.99]Oh no, Bowser again.
[42:44.35]Alright, here we go, the first place.
[42:45.87]Yes, absolutely.
[42:46.67]The best place to use it, here we go.
[42:48.27]Ooh, that was a-
[42:59.12]Oh, that was a really bad turn.
[43:00.96]Alright, here we go.
[43:02.90]For Jerma Ludwig right now, they're very, very far ahead.
[43:05.14]And they have their special right now.
[43:06.28]Absolutely.
[43:06.88]Yeah, they're holding onto that right now.
[43:08.46]The moment somebody takes over them, if they don't get blue shelled, they're going to immediately get hit.
[43:12.30]Oh, they just got rid of it.
[43:13.83]Okay.
[43:14.63]Jerma Ludwig are really far in first place.
[43:16.91]Now, fourth, third, if you're Jerma Ludwig right now, this is going to be amazing.
[43:20.97]The help though, they're so incredibly far ahead.
[43:23.71]Look at that.
[43:24.11]I can't see this hurting them.
[43:25.11]They're still... You need two more blue shells.
[43:27.51]You need a couple of blue shells at least.
[43:29.55]I don't even see.
[43:31.01]They're so far ahead.
[43:32.05]They've retired already.
[43:34.47]That was an upset to say the least.
[43:36.65]How is this happening?
[43:38.15]That was pretty bad.
[43:38.73]There we go.
[43:39.15]I've been commentating.
[43:39.81]I've been Connor.
[43:40.54]I've been Joey.
[43:42.28]Hope you enjoy it.
[43:42.96]Let's get some duds.
[43:44.60]Ludwig, my boy.
[43:47.91]Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
[43:49.31]What is up, chat?
[43:50.12]What is up, chat?
[43:51.04]One, only the Willis and Nefferson.
[43:53.50]Hello, Ludwig.
[43:54.56]It's a fine day for racing, isn't it?
[43:57.08]Will, you seemed a bit protrude.
[43:59.12]Happened that past shy of Josh and Mango's score.
[44:01.38]Wow.
[44:01.74]Troy and Ted are catching up, but they have to beat Connor and Joey in the next three races.
[44:06.67]Otherwise, it's G-Century.
[44:07.97]I mean, I was told that Mango is the god, the great one.
[44:11.43]Doesn't matter if he's at grand finals or burial cart.
[44:13.91]Same performance every time.
[44:15.33]Ice in his veins, cold-blooded.
[44:17.47]He placed top eight for the first time in six months.
[44:19.58]That's right.
[44:20.14]Yeah.
[44:23.08]Contrary to that performance that we just saw.
[44:26.68]Yeah.
[44:26.88]Yeah.
[44:27.38]No, look, here's the thing.
[44:28.34]Mango has the most spawn.
[44:29.93]We would do mango.
[44:30.67]Uh, third's not great for them.
[44:32.97]No, it's not great.
[44:35.03]So at this point, Josh, man, and mango Connor and Joey through, it feels like that is the case.
[44:42.33]Barring Joey getting back to back fourth places.
[44:45.85]If they get back to back fourth places and two cannon flex, get first, second or stability here.
[44:49.97]Hey, what's the math on how I advance?
[44:52.63]You need to win.
[44:53.75]I think it's for you.
[44:55.67]I think what you need here, but not me.
[44:59.46]So the event continues.
[45:00.54]Sure.
[45:01.66]Sure.
[45:02.54]I need to play these games before I come.
[45:05.22]You knew well in advance.
[45:06.26]Well in advance?
[45:07.02]How many days?
[45:09.36]Four?
[45:13.78]I've stolen $500 cash from Mr. B straight up.
[45:16.40]Straight up?
[45:16.92]Straight up.
[45:17.52]Wow.
[45:18.22]I bet you didn't even notice.
[45:20.18]I don't think he did.
[45:21.45]We've got people standing chugging now.
[45:25.49]Yeah.
[45:27.01]I don't believe it.
[45:28.75]I don't believe it, sports fans.
[45:31.08]They had secured first for two and a half laps, Will.
[45:35.16]You talk about hypotheticals.
[45:36.98]You run the scenarios all day.
[45:38.80]But you had a competition.
[45:40.08]Rewind the script, Will.
[45:41.50]It was over.
[45:42.99]I thought we were riding home to mama.
[45:45.47]And right there on the last turn, pandemonium flexed.
[45:50.17]beaming to first place, and the team that needed to win faltering all the way down to fourth.
[45:56.03]I am wet.
[45:56.81]We need Connor and Joey to get third place at best.
[46:01.72]Could Lightning strike twice?
[46:04.06]Who knows?
[46:04.96]Hey, wait, if they take second and the other team takes fourth, do they still move on?
[46:09.22]Okay, okay, this is the scenario.
[46:10.90]Toucan Flex, if they can win this.
[46:13.12]We have to check the scoreboard.
[46:14.04]Toucan Flex in second.
[46:15.70]Now, let's not mistake what just happened.
[46:18.84]If Connor and Joey move on, it was a gift from Troy and Ted.
[46:22.41]Yes.
[46:22.83]It was a treat.
[46:23.87]Every time we fucked a race so bad, those cunts came fourth.
[46:27.57]They were smoking weed every time we came third.
[46:30.51]Huge for the boys.
[46:31.87]Math is going crazy.
[46:33.13]Being crunched in a way.
[46:34.59]I mean, this is Wolf of Wall Street level algebra here.
[46:37.35]It looks like Obama looking over SEAL Team 6 right now.
[46:39.39]That is right.
[46:40.25]Keys are flying.
[46:41.51]Aiden is hitting his head.
[46:42.69]Hold up.
[46:42.99]We have the final decision.
[46:46.71]We have the final tally.
[46:47.77]Come down, Aiden.
[46:52.48]Come here.
[46:53.02]Aiden, come here.
[46:53.58]Aiden, if it's one point, are we going to get a drive-off situation?
[46:56.62]Okay, listen.
[46:57.42]I'm not – I didn't even know this Mario game thing.
[47:00.32]Joey, I would prefer.
[47:01.56]Joey, we're here.
[47:04.22]Oh, my gosh.
[47:04.56]With Joey.
[47:06.34]And so she's been – Oh, she left before she was done?
[47:09.48]Yeah.
[47:09.84]Oh, okay.
[47:10.08]She left before she was done.
[47:11.04]That's good.
[47:11.67]Yeah, so QD is with Gunthers now.
[47:13.45]Okay.
[47:15.25]I mean, Jerma and Ludwig are looking pretty good.
[47:17.67]Mm-hmm.
[47:19.21]uh myth and will will have to do their best and you know we're wondering at the end of the day I mean people people die in the line yeah so they're taking I think the sipping route a little bit of a sipping route a little bit of a sitting around going on it's the beer I don't know who's driving at the moment
[47:39.46]Jerma letter heading heading quick and quick and they're they're in second right now and they got it because they're in there more round As long as you don't hit the sides.
[47:46.28]That is the most optimal.
[47:47.98]Oh, that is Oh, but this better pull their look.
[47:51.46]Oh, and you know Jerma Ludwig.
[47:52.84]They're just kind of hanging out They're doing they're keeping his class on the red shells.
[47:56.44]They'll just took a really long round That is just hard to copy straight one is definitely dependent on the drifts.
[48:05.73]There's a law that's coming in.
[48:07.17]Oh
[48:07.27]Even though that they won the last round I think that you know at that slow start is really gonna be a trouble for this race It is really anyone's game because of the fact that there are a lot of turns happening It is difficult to pick up speed very quick or there's a lot of cliff edges Absolutely a little bit, you know, I'm use if you let's they pull a cutie and they don't finish it.
[48:24.89]Sure Yeah, I don't want to do at the moment running close behind with a second place Wanted so bad with seem to have
[48:32.67]A little bit of trouble in the back here, like, you know, these back three people, they're all just, you know, they're pining.
[48:38.49]They're shortcutting.
[48:40.39]And it looks like the... Oh, they just slipped up!
[48:43.14]They got a double item box hitting into the... I was just like... Dude, the vein in your forehead is popping out right now.
[48:50.86]I fought...
[48:51.96]For that second place.
[48:53.64]Give me my fucking trophy.
[48:57.78]That was a show.
[48:59.78]What happened there?
[49:00.30]Oh, my God.
[49:02.36]The blue shell baby shit.
[49:05.14]I've been against the blue shell.
[49:06.86]We're in second place, by the way.
[49:08.48]I was against the blue shell baby shit, by the way, since the Wii version.
[49:12.90]When did the blue shell come into play?
[49:14.66]So this is more of what you're about to approach right now.
[49:16.61]Was this the blue shell when it was introduced?
[49:18.51]Worst decision Nintendo's ever made.
[49:20.63]Worst decision.
[49:21.39]So this is a personal campaign against the blue shell right now is what's going on.
[49:25.15]That was the most unfortunate loss right there.
[49:29.98]Yeah, wow.
[49:30.74]What an incredible heat at the moment.
[49:32.68]Yeah.
[49:33.20]Looks like a little bit of BabyRage going on here and there.
[49:36.50]A little bit of victory screeches here and there.
[49:42.77]Actually, now that I think about it, even if Jerma and Lud get last here and our team in third gets first, so our top two's decided.
[49:50.47]This last race is for kicks.
[49:53.09]Doesn't do any.
[49:53.85]Wow.
[49:54.32]Okay, so I thought it was going to be.
[49:56.10]No hype in this one.
[49:57.18]No hype in this one.
[49:58.12]Our top two teams are sweaty as fuck.
[50:01.58]And here's the thing, too.
[50:03.03]Somebody might throw up.
[50:04.03]Somebody might throw a chair.
[50:06.35]You know, at a certain level of inebriation, you have no idea.
[50:10.46]well you get disqualified for a variety of reasons and John sasuke what something important here is that uh to keep things all fair for the finals to qualify for just to make sure it's cutie who is driving this race that would absolutely track with cuties the foley off that's right now yeah we've got Jerma ludwig they're really pushing hard there absolutely they probably want it
[50:31.06]more than anything that they've wanted in their entire life.
[50:32.84]See, Jerma and Lug are doing a really good thing where they're doing a lot of micro-boosts around these big corners, which is exactly what you want to do.
[50:38.61]It's, yeah, you know, when you're out of, you know, it's important, it's important.
[50:43.61]So currently right now, first and second.
[50:47.92]Looks like we've got a little bit of a battle for higher heat at the current moment.
[50:51.08]Surely.
[50:52.22]A little bit of struggle is falling off.
[50:54.78]Twitch streamers, influencers, all the like, we all do this.
[50:59.10]We all do it for ego, obviously.
[51:01.15]Incredibly egotistical individuals.
[51:02.99]Oh my god, QD and Nick really weaving through, and they still... Drinking a beer.
[51:08.01]Right behind him, I mean, without even a problem.
[51:09.75]I mean, it still doesn't matter, though.
[51:11.09]QD and Nick coming in with a first place.
[51:13.93]Beautiful.
[51:14.61]Let's see, Myth and Will.
[51:15.48]Gross.
[51:17.58]So, yeah.
[51:18.98]We got a... Yeah.
[51:20.66]So, the first... The top two have already been decided, it looks like.
[51:25.81]Good race by everyone, obviously.
[51:27.61]So...
[51:31.67]We're talking about a verse where Tyler is beating out you and Connor.
[51:36.35]We got a big time point discrepancy going on.
[51:39.06]There seems to be a big time point discrepancy going on.
[51:43.54]Everyone is pretty drunk.
[51:44.76]Mind you, at this point in this tournament, everyone is five beers down.
[51:50.24]Is there a big time point discrepancy going on right now?
[51:53.88]There's a big time point.
[51:55.54]Big time point?
[51:56.28]We like to call it a BTP.
[51:58.50]Big TP's going on.
[51:59.79]BTP happening right now.
[52:01.35]Tactical BTP inbound, and it's not looking good.
[52:04.65]It's looking a little stinky.
[52:07.47]That's a little New York Underground stinky.
[52:09.87]A little bit of New York Underground, a little bit of New York Pizza Rat.
[52:14.88]Ooh.
[52:17.53]Hey, get in here.
[52:19.47]Yeah, I am.
[52:20.05]He's right.
[52:20.41]You're damn right about that.
[52:21.19]I'll let you sit here, and I'll let him.
[52:23.05]So tell me about Connor.
[52:24.93]Oh, the piece of shit known as the MILF Hunter?
[52:28.05]That's what they call him around the streets, man.
[52:30.25]Oh, look at me.
[52:31.55]I'm the MILF Hunter.
[52:32.25]He's been in LA for a month now.
[52:33.85]He's already lost his ability to drink.
[52:36.57]He's got no shot at winning this.
[52:38.11]You think so?
[52:38.99]Secondly, you have to finish your beer.
[52:40.77]Sure.
[52:41.55]Alright.
[52:42.20]Next time we do this, it's a bottle of vodka for each person.
[52:44.94]No more.
[52:45.50]Before we do this, we're going to have laser detectors.
[52:47.94]I'm talking math, dude.
[52:49.50]Now that's Mario Kart.
[52:51.44]That's pod racing.
[52:52.25]Next time, it's a six-inch doobie, and you've got to pull that shit before you finish the race.
[52:55.97]Next time, can we get bonus points for the person that throws up or gets closest to throwing up?
[53:00.30]Wait.
[53:00.94]Crystal Palace, you have to smoke a full bowl of Crystal.
[53:05.76]I'm loving where this is going.
[53:07.88]Everyone's going to be in a K-hole.
[53:10.86]We're looking for Mario Kart K-hole.
[53:13.72]K-hole is the cart.
[53:15.30]Bees will be unmatched.
[53:16.50]We're talking PRs every lap.
[53:19.56]Now, my stomach is like here.
[53:22.38]Yeah?
[53:23.20]You're creating a little bit of a barley child is what we like to call that.
[53:27.06]I'm 85% of the way there.
[53:28.65]Oh, yeah?
[53:28.99]And I have two more beers to go.
[53:30.05]Let's go.
[53:31.28]You don't know how to drive a car.
[53:32.66]Give him the fucking mic.
[53:33.50]You don't know how to drive a car.
[53:36.35]Yeah, fuck you.
[53:37.05]I'm on his team.
[53:38.15]Yeah.
[53:38.43]Yeah, fuck you guys.
[53:39.17]Okay, first of all, you guys can't drink for shit.
[53:41.15]I see you guys chugging.
[53:42.23]You guys chug like a grandma on a Sunday.
[53:44.19]Oh, oh, oh.
[53:44.87]Mr. Stand up to drink.
[53:46.57]Dude, I got to allow my bowels to receive.
[53:49.17]Was it not winning?
[53:50.53]Was it not working?
[53:51.29]I'm sorry.
[53:51.75]Hold on one sec.
[53:52.96]We have both chugged our whole beer in the first 10 seconds of every single match.
[53:56.68]It was like more like 15.
[53:58.04]More like 15.
[53:58.86]12.
[53:58.94]I'll give you 12.
[53:59.30]Maybe 12. 12.
[54:01.78]You don't know how to drive a car.
[54:03.30]You take public transportation everywhere.
[54:04.96]It doesn't matter.
[54:05.92]This is so easy.
[54:06.98]Americans have such low IQ that this will be so easy to win this race.
[54:10.19]You've worn the same outfit for three weeks.
[54:11.41]They don't have roundabouts.
[54:12.41]They see a roundabout, they shit themselves.
[54:14.19]There's so many of them on this race.
[54:16.34]Keep it a buck with me.
[54:17.50]Keep it a buck, alright?
[54:19.08]You're telling me... Hey, Connor, keep it a buck with me, okay?
[54:22.92]You're telling me the American is low IQ, and yet you see a stop sign that says, oh, my God, it looks like a watermelon or something.
[54:29.84]You drive right through it, you kill a family of five, alright?
[54:32.58]That's why you're taking public transportation, you know, and that's why you stand up to drink a beer because, you know, you can't sit down because then you get a moment to focus on how much you don't know how to drive.
[54:41.31]Thank you very much.
[54:49.12]Anyway, for everyone who's here, it is the finals.
[54:52.08]It's the top two from heat one, Josh man in mango, as well as Connor and Joey from trash taste.
[54:58.62]We're going up against me in Jerma nine, eight, five in Nicky England stands.
[55:04.35]Now you've watched a lot of our races.
[55:06.25]Who do you think takes us, Ted?
[55:07.47]You know, I gotta put, I'm going to put all of my money, you know,
[55:12.19]On home team.
[55:12.75]I got to put it on you and Jerm.
[55:15.74]Really?
[55:16.22]You and Jerm.
[55:16.78]You know, because your guys' energy has been electric.
[55:20.94]Your guys' energy has been electric.
[55:22.64]I appreciate that.
[55:23.45]You're walking around.
[55:24.31]You've got your... Whatever the fuck is on your feet right now, those fucking...
[55:29.29]Fish flops.
[55:29.85]Fish flops.
[55:30.75]Flip flops with fish on them.
[55:31.83]He walked in today with those, and I was like, man, he was in public with those.
[55:36.97]That displays a certain level of confidence that is unmatched by many of the competitors here today, Ludwig.
[55:43.12]$4 on Amazon.
[55:45.41]What's up?
[55:45.83]What's up?
[55:47.27]Who?
[55:48.19]We're going to start the final.
[55:49.21]Who?
[55:50.05]You.
[55:50.49]Who asked?
[55:51.41]Has just been disintegrated into tiny specks of dust like he should be.
[55:55.74]Take that, Aiden.
[55:57.00]Way to be a nerd.
[55:57.92]Way to be a nerd.
[55:58.98]We're about to start the finals.
[56:00.08]Now, let me clarify.
[56:01.06]This is one more drinking brand.
[56:02.79]Let's try helping out.
[56:04.19]Four beers total, two beers per person.
[56:06.97]The winner of the Grand Prix wins everything.
[56:09.07]Five points for first, three points for second, one to make it.
[56:11.92]Switching to Natty Light, the beer of college frat boys everywhere.
[56:16.86]Oh, yeah.
[56:17.36]You know it's true.
[56:18.52]I'm hopping off.
[56:18.92]You know it's true.
[56:19.59]Oh, me and Connor want to wager?
[56:22.99]Is Connor playing in this?
[56:23.81]You picked the fucking worst beer ever to do the finals.
[56:27.91]That shit's not supposed to be enjoyable.
[56:29.31]It's a beerio cart.
[56:30.35]Why don't we end it with, like, a fucking nice, like, Bud Lime or something?
[56:34.26]You want Chardonnay?
[56:35.40]Give me a break.
[56:35.96]Yeah, I do want Chardonnay.
[56:37.94]That's what I came here for.
[56:40.50]Let me call Connor.
[56:41.68]Let me call this guy out right now.
[56:42.70]Loser smooches the winner on the lips.
[56:44.75]Wait, what?
[56:46.05]I said loser.
[56:49.15]You're losing confidence fast.
[56:50.15]Keep going.
[56:50.93]No, what did I say again?
[56:51.61]It was loser.
[56:53.11]No, it was something else.
[56:54.11]I said loser misses the winner when they go home.
[56:57.49]Oh, okay.
[56:58.99]That's what he said.
[56:59.81]Connor, if I beat you in this competition, you have to beat all of Pogo Stuck 2 on stream when you get back home.
[57:07.18]What are you going to do?
[57:08.02]Pick a game.
[57:09.28]There's no game that's as bad as Pogo Stuck 2.
[57:11.46]Hollow Knight, whatever you want.
[57:13.75]What games do you play on stream?
[57:14.91]Like, you do talk to Iron Mouse.
[57:17.19]You also do, you chat with Iron Mouse sometimes.
[57:20.30]And then, oh, those streams with Iron Mouse are fire.
[57:23.30]You know, I got to say, Ludwig, it seems like he does a lot of Iron Mouse.
[57:26.10]I do a lot of streams with Iron Mouse.
[57:27.31]It's pretty hype.
[57:29.11]You beat Pokestop 2.
[57:30.21]What do I do?
[57:31.09]Anything.
[57:32.85]Yes, there is.
[57:33.29]I don't know what my Iron Mouse is.
[57:34.63]Ball torture.
[57:35.87]It's a really funny script.
[57:36.63]Like cock and ball torture?
[57:37.93]That's worse.
[57:38.41]Sorry, Iron Mouse.
[57:41.70]I'm not agreeing to that.
[57:43.12]I apologize.
[57:44.04]I haven't been in the world for a while.
[57:46.34]Okay, okay, chat.
[57:47.04]What's a good bet between me and Connor?
[57:48.46]I thought it was a video game.
[57:50.20]Good bet between me and Connor dog voice actor man Loser has to do a shout out for the other podcast on their podcast You do a full like one minute at one minute ad for the other podcast.
[58:00.09]Yeah Oh, oh, what about no loser records a woman to add that plays during the winners podcast?
[58:05.39]Alright.
[58:06.23]Sure.
[58:06.55]Sure.
[58:07.55]Sure.
[58:07.85]Sure.
[58:08.01]That sounds good.
[58:08.53]Okay I think I do I think I can make that call.
[58:11.26]Oh
[58:15.51]Okay, so who's... Ludwig wanted us disqualified because it's the only way you won.
[58:21.30]That was Nick giggling at stands.
[58:22.72]Me and Jerma didn't say a peep.
[58:24.36]We didn't say a peep.
[58:25.42]It was a lot.
[58:26.04]It was kind of a lot of beer.
[58:26.66]I know, but the problem was I was drinking it and all I saw were bubbles.
[58:29.41]Also, I've never chugged a beer literally in my life.
[58:31.77]I want to say, first of all, you did amazing.
[58:33.65]Second of all...
[58:34.57]Because you're in finals.
[58:35.87]You're not happy.
[58:36.55]It's hard as shit to do for real.
[58:38.62]I genuinely think you did amazing.
[58:40.30]And I think if you had drank that remaining liquid, you would have still won.
[58:43.66]I know we would have.
[58:45.60]Rules are the rule.
[58:46.44]I didn't.
[58:47.02]Oh, if genuinely honest to God.
[58:49.76]Was it like that one scene from Incredibles 2?
[58:51.79]If you would have gone through everybody's bottles, everybody had this much left for the past few rounds.
[58:57.19]Everybody had this much left from the past few rounds.
[58:59.25]Mine and Minx's bottles were empty, empty.
[59:01.45]We looked at other people's bottles.
[59:02.41]They had this much, this much.
[59:03.29]If you were to add it up, they were equal to my this much.
[59:05.67]I'm just saying.
[59:06.31]Okay, so you're saying that there's like a sexist aspect to this competition?
[59:08.79]No, I'm saying if you were to measure by volume the amount that people didn't drink, we would actually be equal, and I shouldn't have been disqualified.
[59:14.90]Hey, hey, drink all your beer, loser.
[59:20.18]Okay, who's commentating?
[59:21.26]I gotta play, I gotta play.
[59:22.94]All I gotta say is I've had third and fourth place every time.
[59:28.81]Sorry.
[59:29.85]Mom, if you're watching, I don't drink this much beer ever.
[59:33.07]I'm a vodka pineapple guy, Ma.
[59:34.85]I know you're watching.
[59:35.51]Hey, hey, before you go, can I just say, you've got a wonderful jawline.
[59:39.71]I just wanted to say that.
[59:44.04]Hey there, brother.
[59:44.82]Hey.
[59:45.30]Thank you.
[59:46.26]Mario commentation.
[59:47.82]Yeah, we're doing a little bit of Mario commentary.
[59:51.30]What do we got here?
[59:52.28]Very nice.
[59:55.57]So... What are they doing back there?
[59:57.17]I don't really know what's happening back there.
[59:59.05]I've just... I sort of... And I haven't stopped.
[60:02.17]Well, I'm a fucking loser.
[60:03.25]That's why I'm here.
[60:03.96]No, you're not a... You're a negative winner.
[60:06.68]But that...
[60:09.66]For those at home, I want you to know that they are currently staring at a CRT that is in its idle animation and are celebrating when the DVD hits the point of the screen.
[60:22.35]No, that's classic.
[60:23.25]Passed down by generations.
[60:24.47]Listen, I'm headed out, but we had a good going.
[60:26.55]We were two points off advancing.
[60:28.33]You do what you can.
[60:29.33]I was not a good drinker.
[60:30.77]He was a bad drinker.
[60:31.53]I was a good drinker.
[60:32.37]We figured it out.
[60:33.35]We figured it out.
[60:35.03]I didn't figure it out.
[60:35.63]You did.
[60:35.93]We didn't figure it out.
[60:37.23]We lost.
[60:37.73]We lost.
[60:38.49]You think so?
[60:38.97]I was talking to you, just looking to you.
[60:40.57]I was focusing on what you were saying.
[60:42.25]Speaking of moon runes right now, I'm sure you guys understand it's hard to keep up with what he's saying.
[60:49.00]They're just saying, they're saying rigged, they're saying megalo will, they're saying amazing.
[60:56.25]Choke something.
[60:57.67]Oh, my God.
[60:59.15]Will is too good at commentating.
[61:01.57]You know, I think it's really curious, folks, and I'd call this a conspiracy really.
[61:06.02]Will comes in here, you know, drunk as a doorknob, and then starts saying it's drunk.
[61:11.58]We're not drunk.
[61:12.26]We're drunk.
[61:13.82]We haven't had a lick of liquor in my life.
[61:17.77]I don't even know.
[61:18.27]What's beer?
[61:19.31]What is that?
[61:20.37]That's something my pappy drinks after he comes home from the factory.
[61:24.57]Exactly.
[61:25.25]Yeah.
[61:26.33]Crack open the six pack?
[61:27.53]Crack open the six pack and have a, I don't know, what, a PBR?
[61:30.79]I don't fucking know.
[61:31.87]What the fuck's a PBR?
[61:33.23]What does that stand for?
[61:34.21]Is that a thing?
[61:35.23]Public...
[61:37.30]public bathroom booty relations?
[61:40.36]I don't know.
[61:41.72]Hell yeah.
[61:42.87]Go.
[61:43.37]I just didn't know that.
[61:45.09]You seem like you have an old soul.
[61:47.63]Yeah, I got an old soul.
[61:49.27]That's what they say.
[61:50.45]Really?
[61:51.18]I feel like you're just humoring me right now.
[61:57.89]So, yeah, no, you guys are asking in the chat.
[62:01.90]Oh, what's up?
[62:02.68]Oh, really?
[62:04.12]After a discussion with our competitors, we've agreed that instead of four races.
[62:08.58]Okay.
[62:09.34]Six races.
[62:10.38]Six.
[62:10.80]Okay, more time.
[62:12.23]Two drinky races.
[62:13.57]Two drinking.
[62:14.41]Two sober races.
[62:15.57]Two sober.
[62:16.17]Two final drinky races.
[62:17.65]Two final drinking races.
[62:18.91]Your points across the six races are what counts for the final.
[62:23.16]Bingo.
[62:23.44]Their points across the six races are what counts.
[62:25.50]So the total points are being wiped out, and this is a new score sheet.
[62:28.66]This is new.
[62:29.24]Separate from the heats, new points for everybody.
[62:31.50]Everybody starts at zero right now, and it's six races to go.
[62:34.59]Two drink, two sober, two drink again.
[62:36.71]Two, two, two.
[62:37.63]You heard it here first, folks.
[62:40.01]How many apples does Greg have?
[62:42.63]That's what it sounds like.
[62:43.55]You sound like you're speaking of moon runes to me right now.
[62:45.57]Anyways, we're so excited to be here today.
[62:49.10]Don't say anyways like we got something to talk about.
[62:52.50]Anyways, back to the game.
[62:54.10]Oh, perfect.
[62:57.20]Our competitors are taking it.
[62:59.54]Our competitor is saddling on up.
[63:03.34]I try my commentator voice.
[63:06.44]How many things have you commentated in the past?
[63:08.74]This is my first time commentating.
[63:10.10]Four night events in the past.
[63:11.58]Oh, yeah?
[63:12.02]Yeah, I've done some four night commentating.
[63:13.22]Why don't you take the lead on this one, then?
[63:14.66]Why don't I take the lead?
[63:15.88]Oh, okay, yeah.
[63:16.64]Of course.
[63:17.78]I got you.
[63:18.92]You know, you're the guy.
[63:19.92]Do we control what?
[63:22.06]Okay, what they see, yeah.
[63:23.46]I mean, depending on what zone it is.
[63:25.08]It's probably going to be the top four or the bottom four, and then it's like top four of these.
[63:28.77]Let me see.
[63:29.61]One.
[63:29.75]Oh.
[63:30.65]One.
[63:32.47]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[63:37.11]I was just getting an understanding.
[63:38.41]Yeah.
[63:39.79]Yeah.
[63:40.49]It goes like this.
[63:43.28]Perfect.
[63:44.48]Jeez.
[63:45.12]Alright.
[63:45.56]Well.
[63:45.92]Boy.
[63:52.65]Here we go.
[63:53.21]Are you out?
[63:54.57]Am I out?
[63:55.05]No, I've been out.
[63:55.77]I'm checking every fucking teaspoon of beer.
[63:59.32]If they don't finish their beer, they're disqualified.
[64:01.80]She's bitter.
[64:02.72]I'm so bitter.
[64:03.80]We worked way too hard to get eliminated.
[64:07.20]It's crazy because if we would have finished two seconds of beer, we still would have gotten second place.
[64:11.43]well guess what you should have cutie cinderella and you know it's it's it's a whole thing too because getting drunk for a stream is an investment everyone back here is drunk except for me I'm the only one that's not drunk here and it's like it's kind of annoying I'm the only sober one here you want to know why that is is because you have a gut of gold
[64:33.47]got a gold got a gold you've been taking on the beers have you have you read about the beers six six six and you're you're vibing off six just chilling
[64:48.54]I can't do that.
[64:49.40]You know, is it just like your body is operating at such a high capacity that you're just burning through this beer like it's evaporating the moment it hits your stomach?
[64:58.01]I think I burn through fuel so quickly.
[64:59.85]That's why I'm 150 pounds.
[65:00.93]There you go.
[65:02.07]Like I'll eat a whole steak and cheese sub and it's burnt in an hour.
[65:05.07]Sure.
[65:05.71]Ten minutes.
[65:06.67]Like the steam you can see rising off your body.
[65:09.45]I'll just think of something.
[65:10.68]Neurons just firing.
[65:11.64]Start doing equations in your head.
[65:13.16]Thousands and thousands of equations.
[65:14.60]Thousands?
[65:15.40]Oh, my God.
[65:16.10]A minute.
[65:16.94]A minute?
[65:18.00]And that has been our interview with Jerma.
[65:19.96]Back at you at the studio, Stacey.
[65:23.08]Back to you, Jim.
[65:24.34]Ah, thanks, Bill.
[65:26.22]So we're here still waiting on something fucking to happen.
[65:31.02]Are these right now?
[65:32.54]It's got my name up.
[65:33.40]Oh, shit.
[65:34.30]Oh, it's one.
[65:35.84]I don't think the names on them are accurate.
[65:37.34]Yeah, I don't know if the names on them are accurate, so we don't know how to... Yeah.
[65:40.68]So we know.
[65:41.11]And then... Oh, God.
[65:44.27]Number one.
[65:45.01]And they are putting their all into this.
[65:48.67]They are going to be drinking beer.
[65:50.14]They're going to be...
[65:51.29]getting further inebriated all for the love of back into this link environment we will see uh you know who pulls ahead in this first race but till then we're back to talking about god knows what pretty easy to get down I didn't really have too much trouble whatever that was that a fucking heineken or something like that I don't even remember I'm very well put together correct I am speaking full sentences
[66:18.84]full sentences with per and you know guys off here we go it seems like all of our can be chugged their strategy they're chugging start but who will be off to the race oh yeah they're going and they're running fast Jerma Ludwig they really wanted it indeed so the current lineup right now is Jerma Ludwig in first they've been thinking about a challenge lay you know
[66:44.05]Jerma Ludwig, they got knocked off in second, and they're gonna pull right on ahead.
[66:48.90]Connor and Joey, they also got a big spike, throwing that bead again.
[66:52.26]You know, we got Jerma, they're kicking the bucket right now.
[66:55.70]Wait a second, wait a second.
[66:57.95]Blue Shell hits him.
[66:59.77]And then Jerma Ludwig, they're coming up, they got hit by a banana, but they are still trying.
[67:03.67]Just like that.
[67:04.09]We got Jerma Ludwig in second.
[67:10.12]Um, you know, some teams have a better connection.
[67:12.70]And you know, I think Beerio, and again, Josh Benjamin, get back in first.
[67:17.44]Got to watch out for this dinosaur here.
[67:18.56]Don't hit it.
[67:19.10]You know, they're falling behind and forth real hard.
[67:22.44]They don't know what the fuck is going on.
[67:25.28]As they finish their beer, which puts, you know, puts Tingling and Ludwig, if I could find them on the switcher.
[67:35.62]No, I just haven't used a stream deck in fucking a year and a half, dude.
[67:40.66]That's why I don't know how to use it.
[67:41.87]The one's doing the baby raging.
[67:43.27]Yep.
[67:43.75]And they're winning the game.
[67:46.41]And in dead last, Jerma and Ludwig.
[67:49.05]So give us, Aiden, Adas, give us the rundown.
[67:53.19]World behind us.
[67:54.01]Seriously.
[67:55.25]Jerma, Jerma, quick question.
[67:57.11]After coming in dead last on that last one, how do you feel?
[68:01.40]Oh, well, they're still dead last out of four.
[68:05.07]How are you feeling about going into this next round?
[68:08.35]I'd say Natty Ice is not a good beer.
[68:12.03]I drank the whole thing in one second.
[68:14.58]It wasn't good, though?
[68:15.96]Not a favorite?
[68:19.95]Where's the Stella?
[68:21.07]Where's the Stella?
[68:21.69]Where's Stella?
[68:22.39]Where's Stella?
[68:23.21]That's a good question.
[68:24.21]Where is she?
[68:25.09]Where is she?
[68:25.64]That's a luxurious man's beer.
[68:27.70]That's all I'll say.
[68:28.34]You know, he's walking around like he's luxurious.
[68:32.98]That's for sure.
[68:33.76]That's true.
[68:35.46]Number three, Bowser's Castle.
[68:37.74]No beers.
[68:38.80]No beers.
[68:40.04]This means full competition, zero beers.
[68:43.00]These narrow corridors, they really got to make sure that their drifts are on point.
[68:47.88]They got to make sure that they're not falling off on anything.
[68:50.78]A lot of control like this, you know.
[68:52.30]You know, we've seen a lot of competitors in the past.
[68:55.08]The most important thing, it's going to win you or it's going to lose you.
[68:58.01]Never mind.
[69:00.49]to each other this go taking the first josh man and mango to take that right now we've got josh man mango first Jerma lugwig third Connor and Joey a little bit of a sip at the beginning here but we've got to get on the road then yeah you know they're still first after just a little point check here and mango josh Jerma now these uh competitors have been performing a lot of
[69:31.88]We, you know, might actually take this one to church to get married is what I'd like to say.
[69:40.86]I got to agree with you there.
[69:43.15]And I love that.
[69:43.77]Jerma Ludwig struggling.
[69:45.37]This really is a race for second now more than anything.
[69:48.71]You think so?
[69:49.17]Yeah.
[69:50.01]With first place being so ahead, now it comes down to who's getting second and who's not.
[69:55.70]But anything can happen in these last, you know, 30 seconds of this round.
[69:58.82]When they don't need it to happen, it's going to push them down.
[70:00.94]Taking second off.
[70:01.82]It's going to be soon until they cross the channel.
[70:03.76]And Conor taking second.
[70:05.68]They're going to Jerma.
[70:06.44]Starting to shake a little bit.
[70:07.68]Little shakes.
[70:08.44]It's not the beer.
[70:09.81]He has had as many beers as everyone else.
[70:11.75]Mangus next to me is just like, just done grief.
[70:13.19]I'm like, doo-doo.
[70:15.67]Deep in the backpack right now.
[70:18.33]I love being this Kazooie, but my God, is he cranky at me.
[70:21.07]I can't and I want nothing to do with owning it.
[70:24.39]It's brutal.
[70:24.89]Ready?
[70:25.19]Finish it.
[70:28.15]We don't have that.
[70:28.77]I was there.
[70:31.67]I was doomed.
[70:32.85]Sorry.
[70:33.99]Stupid Australians.
[70:35.97]We were in second place.
[70:37.31]Rainbow Road's hard.
[70:38.29]I just want to double check.
[70:39.13]Well, we were in second, but I... I'm asking about the end, though.
[70:41.77]Yeah, but the end just doesn't matter.
[70:43.03]Oh, you don't think the end of the race... I think that what matters is how long you're in the place for.
[70:48.62]We were in second place for about two or three straight minutes.
[70:51.48]You're in third place for about 13 seconds.
[70:54.64]I think it should be, like, how much time you spent in the position.
[70:57.68]It seems like all the rules you want are rules that benefit you.
[71:03.47]Of course.
[71:05.13]Yeah, that's kind of how it works when you're an egomaniac.
[71:08.29]I wish the rule was not finishing your beer.
[71:11.21]You got screwed there.
[71:12.43]You did get screwed there.
[71:14.97]God damn it.
[71:15.81]It's okay.
[71:16.11]You got screwed there.
[71:16.84]It happens.
[71:17.18]I'll just think about it for the next year.
[71:18.40]It's fine.
[71:20.70]I'll get over it.
[71:21.72]Wait, Chad's spamming F. What is he saying?
[71:23.84]F?
[71:23.92]Uh-oh.
[71:24.62]Uh-oh.
[71:25.44]F. One in chat, if you can hear me.
[71:32.62]That is more than eight seconds.
[71:34.52]F, F, F, F, F. Go, Jerma.
[71:43.06]We were in second place for most of the race, and then I just veered off the edge, too.
[71:46.47]Rainbow Road is impossible.
[71:50.27]They might be dead.
[71:52.77]Two in chat, if you can hear me.
[71:54.31]Two in chat, if you can hear me.
[71:56.01]We're dead.
[71:58.43]Are we still there?
[72:00.66]Wait, don't go yet.
[72:02.86]We lost.
[72:03.74]We're dead.
[72:04.24]We're dead.
[72:05.42]We're dead.
[72:05.78]We're dead.
[72:06.20]Stream's dead.
[72:08.54]It's not?
[72:09.06]Stream's not dead.
[72:10.14]They're all spamming F. Latest live chat.
[72:16.54]F, F, F, F. Oh, because I said say two if you can hear me.
[72:23.76]Are they?
[72:25.32]Oh.
[72:26.84]OK.
[72:27.90]Chat, don't be annoying.
[72:28.85]That's annoying.
[72:33.48]Yeah, we're trying to help.
[72:34.46]We're trying to help.
[72:36.04]Thanks, Tim.
[72:43.46]I expect more from you guys.
[72:46.00]Oh!
[72:49.75]I got a donut.
[72:50.15]Are you commentating with me?
[72:54.55]I'm okay.
[72:55.15]I can commentate until third.
[72:56.69]Oh, my God.
[72:58.43]So they go backwards.
[73:00.27]This is crazy.
[73:01.85]Oh, I was like, why isn't anyone going?
[73:03.63]They're drinking beers.
[73:04.47]I forgot.
[73:05.11]I forgot.
[73:05.89]They're drinking beers.
[73:06.73]Oh.
[73:11.69]Oh, that's because who drank?
[73:13.61]And Dermot and Ludwig are chugging a hat down now.
[73:16.91]You know, the only way to upgrade this stream would be a POV of every setup, which would be a pain in the ass to set up.
[73:23.10]Yeah, like, no, of the people, of the humans.
[73:26.12]Oh, yeah.
[73:26.90]Yeah, because then you could clearly see who's drinking.
[73:29.28]And you can clearly see if someone doesn't finish their beer.
[73:33.16]Next time when we have more than a week?
[73:34.68]Yeah.
[73:36.02]Yeah, this was thrown together in a week.
[73:38.30]Because Joey, the...
[73:40.85]They should be fine.
[73:42.81]It looks like... Is first starting to lap fourth, potentially?
[73:48.24]No.
[73:49.36]Are you sure?
[73:50.52]It looks like it on the overall map.
[73:52.92]Let's see.
[73:53.24]Where's fourth at?
[73:55.00]Look at that.
[73:55.40]Anything else?
[73:55.96]Does this character got an ass?
[73:57.84]Oh, it's a baby.
[73:58.60]That's a baby.
[74:00.06]Anyways, secure the second place.
[74:03.49]A lot of people are dying on this turn that they're actually on.
[74:05.95]Oh.
[74:06.33]Run into a banana.
[74:07.79]Banana.
[74:08.47]This is a battle for second place.
[74:09.75]Yeah, this is a battle for second place.
[74:10.75]It's a battle for second place.
[74:12.75]The whole tournament today has been a battle for second place.
[74:15.39]Yeah, and I think the messed up thing here is like if Mango wins this race, good luck.
[74:20.26]Good luck to your chances of winning.
[74:21.92]Yeah.
[74:22.66]It's sayonara, baby.
[74:24.58]This is, what, the fourth race?
[74:26.10]I don't even think Mango wants a go-kart.
[74:27.80]What's up?
[74:28.94]If Mango wanted a go-kart, he would have just stolen it from our house, like, a while ago.
[74:32.30]Already in.
[74:33.17]Coming in second place is going to be Jerma and Ludwig, slowly but surely crossing the finish line with that Yoshi and Baby Luigi combo.
[74:41.25]They're, you know, predators.
[74:43.81]Yeah.
[74:45.31]Statistically, those ones do, actually.
[74:47.56]No, exactly.
[74:50.06]Thinking about fucking toting this next last round.
[74:52.76]You want to fuck Toad?
[74:53.92]Is that what he just... Back to the butts, I suppose.
[74:58.28]On each other's podcast for the winner?
[74:59.70]Uh-huh.
[75:00.50]They have nine points, we have eight.
[75:02.02]This is going to fucking haunt you tonight.
[75:04.61]I'll never let it go.
[75:06.23]I'll think about this for a year.
[75:07.35]It's okay.
[75:07.73]I still think about stuff and competition and Fortnite from time to time.
[75:13.31]Yeah, it's okay.
[75:15.80]Oh, absolutely.
[75:16.74]That's really sad to think about.
[75:17.52]They're killing turtles.
[75:18.64]Yeah, okay.
[75:20.09]Without a doubt in my mind.
[75:21.09]I was hoping we would never have to confront that.
[75:22.92]Dermot Ludwig getting a big box here.
[75:24.56]What are they going to get out of it?
[75:25.38]A banana?
[75:26.04]Not what you want.
[75:26.60]They're in front, though.
[75:27.70]Oh, never mind.
[75:29.47]That's true.
[75:31.17]That's very true.
[75:32.01]But now Dermot and Ludwig, two red shells throwing them at the competition.
[75:35.75]They got one more.
[75:37.50]I waited, and then I lining him.
[75:39.48]He called it the cringiest thing I've ever done.
[75:41.54]Oh, yeah.
[75:41.74]That's how it goes.
[75:42.86]I don't blame him.
[75:43.40]Sorry.
[75:43.60]You were caught in the crossfire, man.
[75:45.98]The fuck?
[76:06.21]I have never been deeper in the backpack than that.
[76:08.43]Every race I was in on was a fourth place finish.
[76:11.19]Truly, he hit first on every one.
[76:13.17]I've earned this go-kart.
[76:15.77]Hey, at the end of the day, great event, everybody.
[76:21.11]Thank you all for watching.
[76:21.99]I appreciate it.
[76:22.77]Cast.
[76:29.79]Thank you all for watching the Beerio Kart World Cup, everybody.
[76:32.81]That's all we got.
[76:33.89]Woo!
[76:35.10]You guys gotta fly to Florida.
[76:36.50]This fucker has to leave the U.S.
[76:37.74]forever.
[76:38.54]And we'll see you all later.
[76:40.72]Goodbye, everyone.
[76:41.90]See you later.
[76:43.86]Goodbye.
[76:45.91]Later, alligators.
