[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.58]Afternoon, everybody.
[00:02.24]I'll be on a swell couple of days.
[00:11.92]Don't forget about the pre-stream bits.
[00:14.22]Holy shit, don't... Yeah, don't forget about those.
[00:20.45]Oh my god.
[00:24.33]We... I just turned it on.
[00:26.67]Wait, you... This is before the stream even went on.
[00:35.39]Fat Bossant.
[00:38.39]Fat Bossant.
[00:40.33]Fat Bossiant.
[00:41.19]I don't know.
[00:42.47]I'm saying the name like it's a croissant.
[00:44.96]Thank you for the $50.
[00:48.52]$50 from Fat Bossant.
[00:52.42]RIP January 23, 2019 at 7.43pm.
[00:53.36]There's a YouTube link here.
[00:54.16]Let's just make sure.
[00:55.82]Let's see what we're getting into here.
[01:04.47]Where even is that playing?
[01:07.75]Is this even playing?
[01:20.34]I don't like this.
[01:21.06]So is that Eastern Time?
[01:28.87]Does it count if I go back in time like I did?
[01:34.32]Wednesday journey for the Rotunda at 7.43 p.m.
[01:37.22]But that could be local time.
[01:44.18]Fate knows you moved any time zone other than EST.
[01:51.80]Fate predicted that you would move.
[01:53.02]Well, whatever.
[01:54.14]Even if it is Eastern.
[01:55.54]Let's go by the original fate.
[01:57.90]That would mean that at 4... At 4.43 tomorrow...
[02:06.21]I'm gonna be in this chair with my room duct taped.
[02:09.51]And I'm gonna be.
[02:12.44]I had quite the Amazon order.
[02:16.10]Uh, if Amazon, like, wanted to, like, take a look at people, what they were buying.
[02:21.12]I bought, like, a hockey mask, duct tape, and, like, hockey pads.
[02:27.55]Sometimes I look at my fucking orders that I put through and I go, my god, what am I doing?
[02:33.33]I'm like a murderer.
[02:38.56]Like Jason.
[02:42.23]When do you think he gets those masks?
[02:46.73]He has an Amazon subscription order that comes in like once or twice a month.
[02:57.28]Why are you playing hockey in Vegas?
[02:58.64]Vegas has got a good hockey team.
[03:01.20]They just got one.
[03:04.08]The Golden Knights.
[03:06.68]But regardless, thank you so much to Fat Bossiant for 5,000 bits before the stream even turned on.
[03:18.11]The fact that you would just give that... Thanks a lot, really.
[03:23.83]Thank you so fucking much for $50.
[03:25.99]And then P337R, $25.
[03:26.78]Thank you so much, Peter, for the 25 bucks.
[03:39.81]And then Fat Passant said that they demand Tim Machine 9 for the next Jerma Rumble.
[03:46.95]And he's like, he's traveling all over the world in different time periods, so he might show up.
[03:50.79]He might not.
[03:53.10]Anyways, we're gonna play a game called... Why don't we just switch to it so you know what it is.
[03:59.36]Lifeline.
[04:01.11]This game is for PlayStation 2.
[04:02.75]It uses the PlayStation 2 microphone.
[04:05.89]Which is, uh, was actually kind of hard to track down because there's only like two mics that work with this game.
[04:12.43]And I couldn't really find an original PlayStation 2 one.
[04:16.64]And I didn't really want an original PlayStation 2 one because I don't think it's that high quality.
[04:21.30]It would probably misunderstand everything I was saying.
[04:23.78]So I had to get a... an old Logitech PS2 headset.
[04:29.69]And I tested it.
[04:30.29]It works.
[04:31.65]I know you're not seeing any audio right now, but... What's a vet?
[04:38.46]Thanks to the five community subs and Herbert.
[04:40.82]Both of you.
[04:42.04]Five community subs.
[04:43.86]Ten in total here.
[04:46.28]You guys are fucking awesome.
[04:47.06]Yeah, the audio's not on, because you guys are going to have to play a little game here.
[04:50.82]called capturing the PlayStation 2 through a little box, from little box, to capture card, capture card to PC.
[04:59.53]There's gonna be like a thousand milliseconds of audio delay.
[05:02.53]So we're gonna do a Dora the fucking Explorer here in the beginning, where you guys are gonna help me try to fix this shit.
[05:10.12]So, where's it... For a second I thought it didn't have a controller.
[05:13.32]I was like, well that ruined everything.
[05:14.96]No, I got one right here.
[05:19.25]So, this is Lifeline.
[05:21.29]It's a game, I don't even need a controller.
[05:24.67]Because the whole game is used with your voice.
[05:27.03]Every single thing in the game is a voice command, voice activated game.
[05:33.33]And it's like an action shooter.
[05:35.55]And we're gonna try to beat the whole game.
[05:38.77]No we're not.
[05:39.99]You might see me here for like five hours.
[05:42.67]I can't promise that.
[05:46.32]Anyways, I'm ready to go.
[05:48.00]Let's go ahead and get started.
[05:50.30]Let me just get this on.
[05:52.58]God, last time I wore a headset like this was like three months ago because I moved and I had to get a similar one.
[06:00.84]But this is only for the PlayStation 2.
[06:04.10]Let's get an audio sync in here before we do anything else.
[06:08.93]So here comes the audio and you guys are going to have a fun job telling me.
[06:14.95]I gotta make sure it's in the right spot.
[06:17.32]Okay, so let's do a little audio sync test here.
[06:19.74]I'm gonna press the start button.
[06:21.72]Not you, hold on.
[06:22.90]Okay, ready?
[06:24.44]So... How does that sound?
[06:29.20]You should be hearing a little, like, did-a-did-a-did-a-did-a-did every time it's selected.
[06:33.65]It's okay?
[06:36.07]Is it good?
[06:37.75]Alright, now we're gonna do a thing where I'm matching my voice to it.
[06:40.97]Oh my god, somebody just gave a hundred dollars!
[06:44.72]This is almost $200 and I haven't even done anything.
[06:48.02]I just turned on a stream.
[06:50.74]Oh my goodness.
[06:51.72]Vladimir.
[06:53.64]Vladimir Badman, thanks for the $100.
[06:55.01]10,000 bits.
[06:57.05]Thank you.
[06:57.79]I'm gonna say, thanks for the years of quality content, Jerma.
[07:02.21]Shame about your untimely death tomorrow.
[07:04.27]Let me just find... I got a fat suit.
[07:08.19]I got hockey pads.
[07:09.85]I'm padding myself and I'm gonna sit here and we're gonna just fucking read nursery rhymes or something.
[07:15.85]I'm just fine.
[07:17.01]I got boxing gloves.
[07:20.95]But holy shit, Vladimir.
[07:23.01]Thank you for the extreme amount of money.
[07:27.05]All of you guys.
[07:28.94]My god.
[07:29.44]Alright, here we go.
[07:30.20]Ready?
[07:33.56]One, two, three, four.
[07:35.94]One, two, three, four.
[07:37.16]One, two, three, four.
[07:39.60]We lined up.
[07:48.78]Almost.
[07:49.18]Good.
[07:50.04]Sounds fine.
[07:50.60]There's a tiny delay.
[07:52.56]Alright, so you... Is it my voice first, or is it game audio first?
[07:59.45]Hey.
[07:59.95]Hey.
[08:00.45]Hey.
[08:00.95]Hey.
[08:01.43]Hey.
[08:07.17]So my voice is first, so it's like... Okay.
[08:12.27]Tell me if this fixes it.
[08:14.38]Let's see if this...
[08:19.34]Okay, you ready?
[08:20.36]Oh my god!
[08:23.52]Oh no, that just against- Streamlabs!
[08:25.28]I don't know why it takes, like, five minutes to show on screen sometimes.
[08:29.74]Holy shit, I was about to lose my mind.
[08:31.63]Alright, you ready?
[08:33.93]One, two, three, four.
[08:35.87]One, two, three, four.
[08:36.81]One, two.
[08:37.77]Oh yeah, this game's gonna be fun.
[08:39.91]Oh yeah, this game's gonna be fun.
[08:42.87]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[08:46.85]Alright, we're going.
[08:49.05]New game.
[08:49.45]This is Lifeline.
[08:50.13]PlayStation 2.
[08:51.13]Let's get the fuck going.
[08:52.01]What do you say?
[08:59.66]Show your face.
[09:00.42]No, I'm wicked ugly.
[09:02.02]I'm too ugly today.
[09:04.00]I've been feeling kind of ill lately.
[09:05.64]They're gonna hear me say this.
[09:07.80]I don't want them to hear me say this.
[09:18.19]Two to three centimeters from my mouth it is.
[09:19.73]This is crucial.
[09:21.01]Mm-hmm.
[09:21.17]Mm-hmm.
[09:21.53]Mm-hmm.
[09:34.08]Uh, DualShock 2.
[09:36.34]Alright, circle when speaking.
[09:37.71]Hold it down.
[09:38.73]You got it.
[09:39.11]Okay.
[09:39.35]Speak when, talk now, curious, say hello.
[09:42.65]Hello.
[09:43.19]Hello.
[09:43.59]Microphone doesn't, I'm just kidding, hello.
[10:09.69]PlayStation.
[10:15.85]Lifeline.
[10:16.59]Oh, you get points for how good you say it.
[10:20.47]I'm gonna do just fine.
[10:22.91]I'm gonna put on my, like, used car salesman voice.
[10:25.79]Or my telemarketer voice.
[10:28.08]I'm gonna get... Just wait.
[10:34.51]Give an order to the character?
[10:36.21]Walk.
[10:36.37]I can.
[10:36.71]Run.
[10:37.01]That's not great.
[10:37.53]Stop.
[11:03.70]How many tiers of good pronunciation are there?
[11:12.29]Go to the... Go to the table!
[11:14.63]Alright, I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[11:27.32]Look at the bottle!
[11:29.50]What?
[11:29.74]Fuck you.
[11:35.88]Like this, names of objects are revealed when instructions are given successfully.
[11:41.18]If you are not sure of the name of an object, saying its dominant color or basic shape may work instead.
[11:47.96]In this case, saying green bottle is better for recognition than simply saying bottle.
[11:53.18]Once the name is revealed, you can give more specific instructions.
[11:55.86]Okay.
[12:01.29]Check the wine.
[12:05.23]Why am I doing these so bad?
[12:11.56]Am I not saying it good enough?
[12:13.74]Do it faster.
[12:15.72]Seems like nothing is unusual about the wine.
[12:17.44]When you find anything remotely curious, it's best to check the item carefully.
[12:21.56]Additionally, certain objects can be combined with various verbs when you give instructions.
[12:25.75]Drink the wine.
[12:26.67]Get the wine.
[12:27.37]Now move back from the table.
[12:29.65]Oh god.
[12:33.37]Go back.
[12:39.78]Oh man.
[12:41.60]I'm like, this is like an English lesson.
[12:45.82]What?
[12:46.42]So it's turn- is it turn-based or is it... This thing doesn't have a head, stomach, or a mouth.
[12:53.41]It's a shoe.
[13:04.23]Carefully observe the shoe while getting attacked.
[13:10.57]Shoot!
[13:12.91]Jumped over it.
[13:15.30]Move left.
[13:20.68]Shoot head.
[13:25.00]I was waiting, it didn't do anything.
[13:27.13]Dodge.
[13:32.66]Multiple orders can be used in combination.
[13:35.98]This is going to be fun.
[13:38.66]OK.
[13:40.52]Dodge and shoot.
[13:42.58]Should I do my, like, anime voice actor voice?
[13:44.86]Is that better?
[13:45.58]It might be.
[13:49.23]Flee and recover.
[13:50.15]Great.
[13:57.39]Shoot, shoot, shoot.
[13:58.37]Did I get him?
[14:03.64]When multiple enemies appear, targeting can be prioritized with number one, number two, etc.
[14:12.04]Number two!
[14:12.84]Great!
[14:16.08]Number one!
[14:16.80]Excellent!
[14:19.02]In combat, orders must be given to determine where to strike the enemy.
[14:25.12]Okay.
[14:25.46]So let's shoot head, shoot mouth.
[14:27.16]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:36.89]Head shoot!
[14:37.57]Reload!
[14:41.43]Okay.
[14:41.75]So how do you... How do I know what a weak spot is?
[14:46.46]Stomach!
[14:47.66]Stomach!
[15:07.57]Why do I look like this?
[15:09.62]When recognition is poor, pay close attention to the following points.
[15:14.10]Pay attention to this because this is important shit.
[15:17.82]Because I'm going to mess up a ton of these pronunciations.
[15:20.28]One, use proper timing when pressing and releasing the microphone button.
[15:26.78]Two, use the proper voice volume.
[15:30.43]Three, use clear pronunciation.
[15:37.38]This is just a... This is job interview instructions.
[15:43.05]Make sure when you're at your interview, you talk with the proper voice volume.
[15:46.85]Don't intimidate the interviewer.
[15:48.27]This concludes the tutorial.
[15:54.13]It does.
[15:55.43]Alright, let's go.
[15:58.01]Let's go.
[16:01.37]Now we begin our tale.
[16:04.92]Let's go!
[16:10.14]always immediately intimidate the interviewer with a loud voice.
[16:15.61]Do your best Jim Carrey impression when you open the door to the... There's no subtitle.
[16:23.35]Not only was he one of the era's finest medical minds, he also made contributions in alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and mysticism.
[16:38.19]When he was in his thirties, he was said to have incredible healing abilities.
[16:44.44]That prompted him to adopt the name of Parakelsus, superseding Kelsus, the famed doctor of ancient times.
[16:54.76]In his later years, he is said to have gone on a journey of healing, visiting the terminally ill and curing them with miraculous powers.
[17:05.53]I'm not doing this voice.
[17:13.20]just pops up on screen, bad.
[17:14.90]The narrator's like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[17:17.06]That was perfect pronunciation.
[17:37.70]That was, was that actually Orson Welles?
[17:39.54]That was, this is 1990, no this is 2004, guys.
[17:51.00]Pretty nice graphics.
[17:51.78]December 24th, 2029, 10 p.m.
[17:55.90]That's your new death date, Jeremy.
[18:00.54]Yeah, this is PlayStation 2, guys.
[18:01.78]Give it a little bit of slack.
[18:03.28]It's PlayStation 2 being upscaled to like 720p, or like 1080 nearly.
[18:23.56]Doesn't look that bad.
[18:24.56]No, it doesn't.
[18:25.02]I mean, this little device that I have pretty much works great.
[18:39.23]I really don't appreciate the long Star Wars pause silence thing.
[18:44.19]It was the same scene from a different angle.
[18:58.76]Is this the monitor room?
[19:03.02]Here we go.
[19:03.68]My first command.
[19:06.28]Open!
[19:06.90]No, I'm not going to say that.
[19:07.76]That's too easy.
[19:08.72]That's a very low hanging fruit.
[19:10.04]I'm not going to grab it.
[19:11.26]I'm reaching for the fucking coconut that's up there.
[19:13.03]I'm not reaching for the banana.
[19:22.03]A wound.
[19:27.85]I can't read that.
[19:28.97]Surveillance camera recording canceled.
[19:37.68]Okay, I did that for you.
[19:38.24]That's a much better example.
[19:39.54]Okay.
[19:56.48]occasion is extra meaningful for me today we mark the first day to the end of our long-running that's me and naomi here's to the advancement of our country we were lucky to be invited to the space station hotel cheers good evening don't drink it like a cocktail no how do I say no no thank you I don't drink
[20:31.39]Naomi.
[20:35.98]Yeah, why is she doing this?
[20:38.90]Why are you just watching unedited video footage of when you were here?
[20:44.62]You're probably looking for something.
[20:47.92]Somebody... Somebody did something bad.
[20:50.12]This is when the aliens come in.
[21:01.17]The whole room shook violently and something crashed the party.
[21:07.60]They had red eyes.
[21:08.74]An insatiable hunger.
[21:11.24]They started eating guests.
[21:18.45]We ran away.
[21:22.93]It's hurting my eyes.
[21:32.70]And then... I passed out.
[21:37.94]What?
[21:38.82]Oh, is that... Is that some, like, exposition to tell us that that... Separated from my beloved girlfriend.
[21:53.23]Here we go.
[22:03.77]I can't even see.
[22:05.75]Okay, this is the security room.
[22:10.95]I understand what this game is.
[22:16.14]I'm the security officer giving instructions.
[22:22.76]I'm just like the fat guy sitting there at security detail.
[22:27.68]Hello.
[22:33.43]Hey!
[22:33.71]I mean, you didn't say, please.
[22:40.13]Holy shit, what a fucking unbelievable game.
[22:44.45]When did this game come out?
[23:05.24]There's no way that just happened.
[23:06.64]Please disengage the lock on this door.
[23:09.22]Hold on a minute.
[23:11.24]I'm just currently processing some information here.
[23:13.82]We can talk after I get out of here.
[23:15.32]Please disengage the lock.
[23:18.13]Door panel.
[23:18.95]Disengage.
[23:19.77]If you press the button, you'll access the door panel information.
[23:22.91]When that happens, press the button again.
[23:25.23]That will open the panel for controlling the door.
[23:29.30]Oh.
[23:30.30]It's supposed to be a voice game.
[23:32.88]Operate to disengage the detaining cell door lock to operate open the control panel.
[23:36.25]Disengage the lock on this door.
[23:44.87]The lock is open.
[23:48.60]Saved at last.
[23:50.84]A real head case security guard locked me up in there for over an hour.
[23:54.40]Jeez.
[23:56.28]I didn't know what was gonna happen.
[24:02.53]So what's your story?
[24:04.67]Are you trapped inside that monitor room?
[24:07.15]So we share the same dilemma.
[24:08.77]Oh, I wish I could have told my story.
[24:10.55]And now?
[24:12.57]I would have talked her ear off.
[24:21.74]YDNA 10 community subs right now.
[24:25.32]Thank you.
[24:27.08]It's not in here.
[24:30.34]Ten community subs.
[24:31.70]A lot of money.
[24:32.14]Thanks a lot.
[24:35.66]Huge thanks.
[24:36.28]What are you looking for?
[24:41.07]I'm positive that it's here in this room.
[24:45.05]What is in the room?
[24:51.53]Huh.
[24:52.51]It's locked.
[24:53.41]I'll take care of this.
[24:56.09]Stand back.
[24:56.33]Please disengage this lock.
[24:57.95]Just like you undid the other one.
[25:08.14]Yeah, I'm Superman.
[25:10.06]Look at how powerful I am.
[25:11.42]I can make bread bars green and then you can open them.
[25:16.51]Where you going?
[25:22.87]Yeah, I can't talk right now.
[25:25.57]Where'd you get the gun?
[25:26.69]Here it is.
[25:31.98]You just have that.
[25:33.52]I should take care of any monsters.
[25:36.04]Uh, that's not gonna happen.
[25:36.62]You're gonna open this door and you're gonna need my help immediately.

[30:11.97]Linda.
[30:12.51]Rhonda.
[30:13.92]No, that's not it.
[30:15.20]It was three syllables.
[30:17.10]Come on, what's the name of that girl?
[30:19.70]Naomi.
[30:21.20]Oh, right.
[30:22.12]Naomi was her name.
[30:25.16]And she... I wouldn't have gotten... We would have been there all day.
[30:28.00]I would have had to reset the game if I didn't get cheated in chat.
[30:30.41]Well, no wonder.
[30:31.31]And all that commotion.
[30:32.63]Me, I don't even remember how I managed to get out of the restaurant.
[30:37.25]I'm worried about her.
[30:39.21]She may be in need of help somewhere.
[30:41.98]I didn't even know.
[30:42.86]I wasn't paying attention.
[30:43.86]SpongeBob meme.
[30:44.26]Punching over.
[30:45.01]Did I count on your help?
[31:13.16]you can call me rio okay glad to meet you operator are you ready oh should I have to say yes I forgot I have to like do everything I guess there's no need for formal introductions oh yes well that's fine I won't fail in my search
[31:44.01]Shut down the stream.
[31:44.94]That's the worst joke.
[31:46.42]It was a fake one.
[31:47.70]I was making a fake reference to a meme overuse thing.
[31:51.36]Oh no.
[31:51.56]I need a password.
[31:52.30]Let's see.
[32:09.10]Banana.
[32:10.21]Coconut.
[32:10.79]Consultation?
[32:11.99]Is this just that movie with, um... Consultation.
[32:13.51]Uh, with Tom Cruise.
[32:15.07]No, that's a fucking spoiler.
[32:16.91]I can't do movie and TV spoilers this stream.
[32:34.07]I intend to follow your instructions for doing most things.
[32:37.71]But if your instructions are hard to understand, I'll get confused.
[32:41.04]For instance, if you were to say, go over there, I'd be like, which way is there?
[32:44.26]So if you want me to go somewhere, I want you to say its name.
[32:47.30]Okay.
[32:51.06]For example, in this room, there are places like the lockers and the table.
[32:56.36]You know how you can display maps in the monitor room?
[33:00.75]Direct me where you want to go by the name on the map.
[33:03.71]Okay.
[33:05.59]Do you understand?
[33:06.23]Not really, but yes.
[33:09.75]Okay.
[33:11.06]The map that you just saw, you can access and display it on your monitor.
[33:14.86]If there's anything else you don't understand, check the keyword list.
[33:19.04]That list records keywords and phrases that are extracted from our dialog.
[33:23.36]Not only that, the list already contains words in the operator's manual.
[33:27.44]Of course, there are plenty of words that aren't on the list.
[33:30.67]Anyway, how about giving me my first instruction?
[33:34.53]What should I do?
[33:41.11]Hmm.
[33:42.35]A lot of options here.
[33:50.42]Go to the bathroom.
[33:51.64]Yep.
[33:56.00]No, no, no!
[33:56.80]I don't mean, like... That's... That's not what I mean.
[34:00.86]Guys.
[34:03.17]I mean, like, I want to go into the bathroom.
[34:08.41]Uh...
[34:11.99]She's just currently walking around.
[34:20.49]She did it, okay.
[34:22.57]Get a snack from the vending machine.
[34:24.43]The vending machines, okay.
[34:32.32]Bottom left vending machine receptacle.
[34:35.38]These are the vending machines.
[34:39.56]Put hand in vending machine.
[34:44.74]Put hand in leftmost slot.
[34:48.92]If there is something, it would be good.
[34:52.18]Nope.
[34:53.16]Too bad.
[34:54.18]It's empty.
[35:00.62]Dispenser.
[35:06.22]Put hand in right dispenser.
[35:10.74]Hmm.
[35:12.18]There was nothing.
[35:14.14]I'm disappointed.
[35:15.81]No, I see something in there.
[35:18.05]Put hand in dispenser slot number three.
[35:22.69]Put hand in dispenser.
[35:25.33]Put hand in dispenser.
[35:30.82]Grab item in dispenser.
[35:32.92]Which dispenser do you mean?
[35:41.36]Put hand in first dispenser slot on the right.
[35:46.32]I've checked it earlier.
[35:48.80]That was enough.
[35:54.88]Put hand in second from the right dispenser slot.
[35:59.64]I've checked it earlier.
[36:02.13]That was enough.
[36:05.85]Middle right dispenser.
[36:07.35]The dispenser?
[36:08.01]I don't know what you mean.
[36:13.03]Put hand in middle right dispenser.
[36:16.99]I've checked it earlier.
[36:19.45]That was enough.
[36:26.62]Check all dispensers.
[36:28.96]Which dispenser do you mean?
[36:32.16]Check third dispenser.
[36:35.80]Check third dispenser.

[37:06.65]There's an item in there that I have to get.
[37:11.00]Red left.
[37:12.04]That's not going to work.
[37:14.75]Pilot guy, thanks for the five community subs.

[37:20.47]Just coming in right now.
[37:23.09]Left red.
[37:30.20]Just do it without the mic.
[37:31.98]Those of you that are just joining the stream, I cannot move.
[37:35.42]It's only voice commands only.
[37:38.38]Check the third slot.
[37:41.71]It only says juice.
[37:43.23]What?
[37:44.43]Everything's sold out except for prune juice.
[37:48.31]Consultation.
[37:49.25]Wait a second.
[37:50.47]Can that consultation wait?
[37:52.31]Let's check this first.
[37:54.55]No, I can't even get tech support.
[37:57.09]I'm on hold right now.
[38:09.34]Okay, I'm gonna try this again.
[38:12.01]Grab.
[38:13.47]You're too vague.
[38:15.27]I don't know what you mean.
[38:19.24]Check dispenser slot three.
[38:23.40]Which dispenser do you mean?
[38:27.06]Look at right dispenser.

[38:38.11]Check second from the right dispenser.
[38:41.84]I've checked it earlier.
[38:42.66]It's not going to happen.
[38:44.31]That was enough.
[38:48.77]This is the... The item's right here.
[38:52.93]Just Dispenser 3.
[38:54.89]I've said every single one of these.
[39:00.02]Check Dispenser 3.
[39:02.58]Which dispenser do you mean?
[39:03.90]That's what happens.
[39:09.25]Right Vending Machine.
[39:11.00]These are the vending machines.
[39:17.11]Grab item red from left.
[39:19.87]No, that's like I got hit the head with a hammer and just said five random words.
[39:28.26]Pick up item from dispenser.
[39:31.44]I've checked it earlier.
[39:33.93]That was enough.
[39:44.40]I can't select them either.
[39:45.46]There's an item in here.
[39:46.88]She needs to get this.
[39:51.89]There is an item in the dispenser.
[39:54.61]On the right.
[39:59.97]No response.
[40:05.85]Jerma, your right is her left?
[40:09.81]No, it isn't.
[40:15.41]Check second dispenser from the right.
[40:19.08]There's something in here.
[40:20.24]Okay.
[40:21.40]I said that like 15 times.
[40:22.44]A piece of paper.
[40:25.12]Microphone check, it says.
[40:34.89]Back up.
[40:35.97]Pardon me?
[40:37.57]Do what to what?
[40:38.91]Sure you did.

[40:51.51]Stop.
[40:51.99]Stop.
[40:52.72]Stop what you're doing.
[40:53.58]The lockers.
[40:54.40]Okay.
[40:58.80]Oh, no.
[40:59.34]Not like a Sesame Street bullshit all over again.
[41:04.35]Open.
[41:05.49]Locker all the way to the right.
[41:11.77]I checked that earlier.
[41:19.30]Oh, God.
[41:19.82]I didn't even need to say anything.
[41:39.64]A license plate.
[41:40.32]Good.
[41:55.53]I really like your hat.
[41:58.51]The writing's too sloppy for me to read.
[42:01.01]Why don't you analyze it?
[42:02.89]Sure thing, I'll analyze.
[42:05.98]December reading material purchases electronic newspaper magazines.
[42:09.24]All reading materials are to be returned to their designated spaces after use.
[42:16.62]Grab guard's note.
[42:20.32]It's a handwritten note.
[42:21.99]It doesn't look important.
[42:24.49]to you, but it's reading material for me when I'm on the can.
[42:30.45]Um, okay.
[42:32.59]Do I have a map?

[42:56.71]Javadav coming in with 10 community subs.
[42:58.67]What do you think about that?

[43:04.51]But thank you, Javadav.
[43:07.37]A lot of big subs and big bits very early in the stream, so thank you guys.

[44:20.94]Anything here of value that I need to get?
[44:24.49]Check document.
[44:26.14]Pardon me?
[44:27.75]Do what to what?
[44:32.45]Look at magazine.
[44:34.59]This is a really popular entertainment magazine.
[44:37.15]I read it occasionally.
[44:43.28]Find fax machine.
[44:45.56]Fax me magazine.

[45:20.53]Thank you for the 10 community subs, clown car.
[45:25.79]Grab cup.
[45:27.75]This paper cup must be from the vending machine.
[45:30.29]It's empty.
[45:34.47]I'm not going to say that.
[45:35.45]So there's nothing in it.
[45:39.28]I can't take it, though.
[45:40.82]Take cup.
[45:42.60]I don't intend to take anything except what I need.
[45:45.94]But that's not what I'm telling you to do.
[45:49.38]Check papers.
[45:50.91]Paper?
[45:52.57]There's a lot of paper around.
[45:54.09]Which do you mean?
[45:57.39]Check left paper.
[45:59.65]It's a report by the security guards.
[46:03.20]Hello to bark like a dog.
[46:05.34]Middle dog?
[46:07.60]Our big dog.
[46:12.26]Scream as loud as you can.
[46:14.34]Let's see.
[46:15.64]This month's features on chips.
[46:18.80]I collect them too.
[46:21.92]Scream.
[46:22.40]So what is that?
[46:23.28]Let's report.
[46:24.44]What is that thing?
[46:24.88]A tablet?
[46:28.72]Check tablet.
[46:29.12]Yes.
[46:29.22]Yes.
[46:29.46]What?
[46:29.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[46:30.16]I was answering a question.
[46:32.00]That's alright.
[46:33.97]Grab notebook.
[46:51.47]It's the security guard's notebook.
[46:53.67]Like a diary.
[46:55.11]I'm not interested.
[46:57.29]Sure, okay.
[46:57.65]Well, we've got some consoles here.
[47:00.39]Activate left console.
[47:05.63]Not a chance.
[47:06.71]It's totally wrecked.
[47:08.64]All of them?
[47:10.06]All these PCs all fucked up?
[47:11.20]Caution, malfunction caused by abnormal external shock.
[47:14.32]Yeah.
[47:19.65]Alright, what else is in here?
[47:21.01]Table, this is pretty much it.
[47:23.73]So we got, we got the stuff we needed.
[47:25.77]Let's take, you know, holding cell.
[47:28.96]Go now.
[47:34.28]Faster.
[47:34.64]No, holding cell one.
[47:36.12]Run to holding cell one.
[47:37.72]How do I save the game?
[47:51.67]You guys are with the community subs tonight.
[47:53.25]Holy shit.
[47:53.77]Jamie, five community subs.
[47:56.15]Thank you.
[48:04.54]Run to holding cell one.
[48:05.72]Grab the Mio water enhancer.
[48:11.04]What even is that?
[48:21.84]Holding cell two.
[48:22.76]Holding cell two.
[48:23.90]Right.
[48:25.20]There's nothing in here.
[48:25.96]I checked from corner to corner while I was locked up.
[48:30.68]Check holding cell three.
[48:31.86]Okay.
[48:32.38]Holding cell three.
[48:34.90]This place is empty.
[48:35.80]Let's check somewhere else.
[48:38.50]Moron.
[48:39.22]I am walking.
[48:40.00]Alright, well, I got, uh... Holding cell one.
[48:47.79]I checked everything.
[48:48.45]So now we gotta go...
[48:52.58]I'm not sure where the hell... How do I get... Go to the hallway.
[48:56.08]Okay, I'll leave.
[49:02.65]Never checked tablet.
[49:06.91]That's the save point?
[49:08.79]I told her to look at it and she looked at me with... Operator, look.
[49:17.64]Emergency shutters have been activated all over the place.
[49:20.87]It doesn't look like we'll be able to go on a casual tour of the station.
[49:25.45]First, there's something I'd like you to confirm.
[49:28.91]What's that?
[49:32.93]Please analyze this video disk.
[49:38.32]Interview footage, December 24th, observatory restaurant.
[49:42.86]On.
[49:43.68]Okay, you managed to get back.
[49:45.76]You couldn't just flip the phone up yourself.
[49:48.62]Do you see the woman who's interviewing Prime Minister Takayama?
[49:54.43]Her name is Helen Johnson.
[49:57.17]She's a big wig announcer for a major TV network.
[50:01.19]I need to find her and speak with her.
[50:03.99]She has information that can help me.
[50:05.88]Your autograph can wait.
[50:07.38]I haven't found a single lead since the chaos started.
[50:11.36]I'll have to check rooms one by one.
[50:14.54]Helen the reporter, and your Naomi.
[50:18.09]Let's work together and find them.
[50:20.81]Okay, how about some guidance?
[50:23.41]Where should I start searching?
[50:26.11]Uh... I forget- I don't know what that place is even called, so... Go to vending machine.
[50:34.34]Okay, I'll walk.
[50:40.92]Go to holding cell one.
[50:43.03]Shutter one, okay.
[50:44.66]Oh no.
[50:46.32]What?
[50:49.24]What's going on?
[50:56.57]Oh.
[50:57.31]Shoot head.
[51:00.71]Shoot.
[51:02.85]Shoot head.
[51:04.63]Shoot stomach.
[51:08.63]Go.
[51:09.13]Turn around.

[51:13.18]Back.
[51:14.26]Back.
[51:15.40]Back.
[51:16.88]Shoot head.
[51:18.66]Shoot stomach, one.
[51:21.45]Shoot head, two.
[51:27.35]Shoot stomach, two.
[51:40.87]Oh my god, look at all this.
[51:42.13]I need to go, I need to save the fucking game.
[51:44.18]Can I leave?
[51:49.08]Alright, let's check, we're right here.
[51:52.38]Go to guest room one.
[51:54.38]I'm talking!
[51:55.88]Excuse me.
[51:57.02]Go to guest room one.
[52:00.30]Hurry up!
[52:14.33]Well, I was trying to talk, and she just started speaking over me.
[52:24.78]She's like, give me directions, and I'm like, sure, I'll give you directions.
[52:28.12]I'm giving directions right now.
[52:32.00]I was speaking first.
[52:45.04]Is someone there?
[52:46.96]Pet peeve discovered.
[52:51.40]No, I'm just fucking kidding.
[52:52.54]There's no reply.
[52:54.60]So where should I begin checking?
[52:57.33]Tell me, please.
[53:01.13]No, you know what?
[53:01.89]When I am talking to somebody, listen to this, okay?
[53:03.71]When you're in a conversation with somebody and everybody has that moment where they know that you both start talking at the same time, right?
[53:12.28]So I have something I want to say and you have something you want to say.
[53:14.88]It usually goes by who got it out first, right?
[53:18.88]And then you start to have that internal fake little battle where who's going to stop talking first?
[53:23.80]Who's going to let the other one just win?
[53:25.50]So, you know, for instance, if we're talking about a movie we saw, and we're talking about, like, Thanos, right?
[53:31.81]Oh, Infinity War was such a great movie.
[53:33.37]And especially, I think the point of the movie is when Thanos, like, if I start saying what I think the point of the movie is, and you start saying what the point of the movie is at the same time, one of us has to back down eventually.
[53:45.07]So what happens is whoever got the word out first, that person gets to keep going.
[53:50.63]The other one has to just back down.
[54:01.24]And then you can make your point afterwards.
[54:02.50]Now, the problem is if that person does not let you in, right?
[54:06.29]So if we start talking for five straight seconds both, okay, you started saying, you started talking first.
[54:10.95]I'm going to back down here.
[54:12.33]And you're going to talk for about 30 or 40 seconds.
[54:14.49]Now, let me come in.
[54:15.33]And the thing about the ship, the ship was just bullshit.
[54:18.05]It's like, okay, now you're not playing by the rules.
[54:19.89]I want you to give me instructions.
[54:25.65]Every about 30 or 40 seconds, you got to let the other person in.
[54:31.70]Walk to table.
[54:32.82]The table.
[54:33.58]Okay.
[54:39.43]You can't just talk for like two straight minutes if somebody's in a conversation with you.
[54:43.33]It just doesn't work.
[54:45.97]Then that person eventually is going to throw the hot coffee.
[54:49.59]Are you talking about that?
[54:52.91]Yes.
[54:53.77]Grab coffee cup.
[54:55.29]This?
[54:56.67]It's useless.
[54:57.91]There's no need to take it.
[55:00.32]Dump coffee on self.
[55:02.34]Are you talking about that?
[55:11.74]Grab camera.
[55:13.10]It's a real antique, this camera.
[55:16.05]It's manual focus.
[55:20.43]No film, no batteries, no lens.
[55:21.97]Okay, so... Drink coffee.
[55:25.75]Do you mean drink the coffee?
[55:27.69]That's what I just said.
[55:28.45]I don't think this is a good time.
[55:32.95]Alright.
[55:34.11]Read newspaper clipping.
[55:36.50]We are a five-star hotel serving only the most distinguished guests.
[55:40.40]We hope you enjoy your stay.
[55:43.48]That's true.
[55:44.52]Ordinary people couldn't afford this hotel.
[55:46.31]Okay.
[55:53.75]Save point.
[55:54.71]Go to save point.
[55:56.48]The save point, okay.
[56:03.16]Take out $100, cash.
[56:11.81]No, don't cancel the save.
[56:12.79]Oh, I forgot.
[56:15.23]Square is... It's the weird place that the old PlayStation systems had.
[56:23.23]Yeah, do it.
[56:25.04]Guest room 1, hour and 23 minutes, number of commands 138.
[56:45.07]Go to bed.
[56:57.63]Monster.
[57:02.67]Shoot head.
[57:05.42]Shoot head.
[57:07.96]Dodge right.
[57:10.68]Shoot stomach.
[57:14.36]Shoot mouth.
[57:14.84]Mouth!
[57:17.56]Shoot stomach.
[57:20.02]Stomach!
[57:20.60]Reload.
[57:25.43]Her aim is horrible.
[57:27.33]Yeah, it is.
[57:31.07]Don't... Oh my god!
[57:32.47]That's giving me so much angst.
[57:35.13]Yes, you've done it.
[57:37.00]Thanks to you, we're saved.
[57:39.10]Shoot.
[57:40.86]Huh?
[57:41.62]What?
[57:41.92]You're just a damn waitress?
[57:43.93]Great.
[57:45.81]So what's your name, baby?
[57:47.79]It's Rio.
[57:50.31]Jesus.
[57:51.17]This thing had us trapped in the bathroom.
[57:53.47]Now my hotel is a friggin' mess.
[57:58.14]Son of a... How did you spit on the floor?
[58:00.92]Isn't it my luck to be saved by some waitress?
[58:04.68]But I suppose I do owe you a thanks.
[58:08.97]Now you're on camera.
[58:36.97]What the hell is a guest doing in the monitor room?
[58:39.63]Uh, yeah, somebody made a really good point.
[58:42.05]Why are there cameras in the bedrooms?
[58:43.75]Well, if I know.
[58:44.75]There was an explosion, then those monsters appeared all over.
[58:48.15]God knows what the hell they are.
[58:50.25]Some alien swarm, or rather.
[58:53.40]Still, they ain't Jack if you can blow them away with a handgun.
[58:57.14]Run along and rescue our guests.
[58:59.10]I'll look for the Prime Minister.
[59:00.82]This guy's gonna be dead.
[59:02.06]He came out of the transportation ministry, and I'm screwed if he dies in my hotel.
[59:07.29]sir what do you kiss your mother with that mouth whoa problem with it I'm trying to help and you're being a real jerk uh that was surprising save it for someone who cares bimbo this guy's gonna end up like eating five minutes arrogant jerk yes that was manager tanaka he's in charge of this hotel
[59:40.54]You told me to go rescue the guests?
[59:42.48]Maybe he's the one who needs help.
[59:44.77]Well, anyway, what should we do now?
[59:49.91]We're in the bedroom, right?
[59:53.47]Go to bed.
[59:53.99]The bed, okay.
[59:56.37]It's an ordinary bed, but with soft springs in it for low-gravity use.
[60:00.20]Huh.
[60:01.28]I wonder what this is.
[60:02.18]Another one of those devices.
[60:04.12]Hey!
[60:05.14]A heal capsule!
[60:08.62]Just a flask of whiskey.
[60:09.12]Lie in bed.
[60:09.40]Lie down.
[60:09.60]Jump on bed.
[60:09.92]Sit in chair.
[60:40.43]Nope.
[60:42.39]Uh, no, okay.
[60:44.71]No, what else do we have here?
[60:46.33]We got, uh, go to the emergency panel.
[60:49.65]The emergency panel.
[60:51.10]Okay.
[60:56.00]Tell her to do a sexy pose.
[60:58.68]Is that, like, that's like a meme thing.
[61:01.46]Emergency tools are stored in here.
[61:03.46]I'm pretty certain that there's a key for the hallway shutters in here.
[61:09.42]That's strange.
[61:11.30]It looks like someone's already taken it.
[61:12.86]Hmm, strange.
[61:14.92]What else?
[61:16.72]There's nothing else that needs checking.
[61:19.46]Uh, then I guess, you know, I guess do a pose.
[61:28.07]Do a pose.
[61:32.39]Do a sexy pose.
[61:38.29]Stop.
[61:38.83]Yes.
[61:40.10]Do a pose.
[61:41.94]Hello?
[61:43.22]What was that?
[61:46.00]Do a pose.
[61:47.42]I am stopped.
[61:50.08]Do a sexy pose.
[61:53.44]This is horseshit.
[61:54.50]You guys just made me do this for no reason.
[62:03.57]Oh my god.
[62:04.63]I thought this was gonna be like one of the meme inputs.
[62:09.36]Is he actually watching me?
[62:11.42]Oh my god damn it.
[62:12.50]Okay, whatever.
[62:15.22]Go to the dresser.
[62:15.94]The dresser.
[62:17.10]Okay.
[62:20.52]You fuckers.
[62:26.48]It actually does exist.
[62:32.57]Look at mirror.
[62:33.93]I want to get changed out of this outfit.
[62:40.41]Check luggage.
[62:44.55]Check trunk.
[62:49.81]Another chip.
[62:55.90]Does she know how loud you are?
[62:58.34]I'm curious.
[62:59.26]Alright, I'm going to be kind of loud here, so I just want to give you guys some warning.
[63:01.88]If you want to drag the volume slider a little bit to the left here, I'm going to give you some warning.
[63:06.72]Here we go.
[63:09.34]Ah!
[63:10.31]By the bed.
[63:11.43]Okay.
[63:15.07]No.
[63:15.53]There doesn't seem to be anything else.
[63:17.59]Let's check somewhere else.
[63:22.17]Go to mirror.
[63:22.97]I am walking.
[63:25.04]Go to mirror.
[63:26.18]The table.
[63:26.96]Okay.
[63:28.48]Stop.
[63:28.98]Yes.
[63:30.54]Check mirror.
[63:32.20]I am standing.
[63:34.06]Go to mirror.
[63:35.54]The dresser.
[63:36.00]Okay.
[63:36.66]Okay.
[63:39.62]What a weird fucking word that is.
[63:42.32]Look in mirror.
[63:43.46]Smash mirror.
[63:44.44]Eat glass.
[64:20.38]That's a great question.
[64:25.70]Run to security room.
[64:27.52]Run there.
[64:27.78]There we go.
[64:28.10]Run.
[64:28.18]Run.
[64:28.56]Run faster.
[64:29.60]Run as fast as you can.
[64:50.97]This is the security room.
[64:53.49]Leave.
[64:53.92]Yes.
[64:57.98]Leave.
[64:58.36]I am stopped.
[65:01.14]Leave room.
[65:02.16]Yes.
[65:05.30]I'm not going to say that.
[65:08.81]Leave the room.
[65:09.47]Don't do a lap.
[65:12.29]Do a lap.
[65:13.29]Yep.
[65:16.41]Do a lap around the room.
[65:17.87]Okay.
[65:18.55]I'll leave.
[65:19.99]There we go.
[65:21.32]I'm not going to say that.
[65:22.26]Why would I say that?
[65:22.96]That makes no sense.
[65:27.36]That doesn't make any sense.
[65:28.50]Why would that ever be an input?
[65:36.01]Where should I go?
[65:36.63]Alright.
[65:40.27]We got guest room.
[65:44.06]Go to guest room four.
[65:46.30]Guest room four.
[65:47.04]OK.
[65:49.70]It's an Easter egg.
[65:50.60]Say it.
[65:51.00]Oh, is it really?
[65:54.90]Run.
[65:57.76]Walk.
[65:59.74]Crawl.
[66:00.14]Sneak.
[66:00.64]I don't think I can do anything here.
[66:11.91]I don't think I have that.
[66:17.35]If we don't find the shutter key, we won't be able to progress.
[66:23.88]So we can't go that way.
[66:27.28]So we can go to... Maybe we can't.
[66:36.13]Because that's... We can go to security room, guest room 1.
[66:41.33]Let's see...
[66:44.52]Go to shutter 9.
[66:48.36]Can we open this?
[66:51.40]No.
[66:52.22]Go to shutter 7.
[66:55.31]Run.
[66:55.71]Because only the two guest rooms.
[67:02.29]Oh, the guest room and security room.
[67:03.81]I need a key.
[67:05.99]Can I open this one?
[67:09.60]No, I can't.
[67:14.61]Is the shutter keys in the guest room?
[67:16.01]Go to security room.
[67:16.61]Run.
[67:16.89]There's that one thing on the table that I didn't actually look at.
[67:21.39]Braid hair?
[67:43.29]Frodian Weapon, thanks for the five community subs.
[67:45.71]Thank you so much.
[67:48.11]Five just came in.
[67:52.07]Check table.
[67:52.89]What is this thing called?
[68:01.76]Check newspaper.
[68:06.56]Fart on the bike.
[68:07.60]That's too easy.
[68:08.96]And I'm not doing that.
[68:09.56]Why would I... No, it doesn't do anything.
[68:12.84]Read newspaper?
[68:13.82]I can't believe I'm... No, I'm not going to say this.
[68:27.29]Because there's no way it's a... There's no way.
[68:33.44]Go to guest room one.
[68:35.34]Leave the room?
[68:37.06]Okay.
[68:37.74]Leave room... Run.
[68:40.42]Run.
[68:40.72]Yes.
[68:52.53]Everyone in the chat is just shouting commands that I'm never going to say.
[68:56.73]Guest room one.
[69:00.03]Run.
[69:02.43]Run.
[69:13.85]Wasn't it already open?
[69:17.69]Oh my god.
[69:18.65]Why is it... I just closed it.
[69:21.85]Sorry.
[69:25.04]What?
[69:25.68]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:27.30]Stop.
[69:27.92]Guest room one.
[69:34.34]Run.
[69:43.73]File your taxes.
[69:45.89]You're doing it wrong, Jerma.
[69:46.81]We're giving commands to you, not the girl.
[69:51.24]Well, none of that's gonna happen.
[69:53.68]Alright, bathroom.
[69:55.98]Go to bathroom.
[69:59.32]Run!
[70:04.19]I think I see a disk underneath the sink.
[70:11.15]Punch mirror.
[70:13.77]Wash face.
[70:21.16]It's an ordinary washstand.
[70:22.60]There's nothing unusual.
[70:29.25]Item under sink.
[70:30.99]Under the sink?
[70:34.67]Oh.
[70:35.95]Here's the shutter key.
[70:39.85]Nice job.
[70:40.73]Nice job.
[70:42.17]Nice work.
[70:48.23]Nice work.
[70:49.15]Nice work!
[70:50.15]I didn't understand that.
[70:51.99]I said nice fucking work!
[70:53.51]I didn't understand that.
[70:54.95]Nice work.
[70:55.79]Huh.
[70:56.85]The floor's been thoroughly cleaned.
[70:59.07]It's sparkling.
[71:00.71]Good job.
[71:01.49]I'll walk.
[71:06.97]Back.
[71:07.59]The bathroom.
[71:08.37]Okay.
[71:09.23]Run.
[71:09.81]Yes.
[71:14.77]Shower.
[71:15.49]The shower itself is ordinary.
[71:18.20]Over 90% of the water used here is recycled.
[71:23.12]Okay.
[71:26.66]Destroy window.
[71:28.80]The living room.
[71:29.78]Okay.
[71:30.22]No, stop, stop, stop.
[71:31.84]Stop.
[71:33.70]Shoot mirror.
[71:36.08]Shoot mirror.
[71:37.66]Back.
[71:37.90]The bed.
[71:38.58]Okay.
[71:39.33]Stop.
[71:39.85]Yes.
[71:40.69]Shoot mirror.
[71:42.33]Go to mirror.
[71:43.19]Okay, I got it already.
[71:45.13]Stop.
[71:45.45]Stop.
[71:46.06]There doesn't seem to be anything else.
[71:47.30]You don't got it.
[71:47.88]You don't got it.
[71:48.30]Let's check somewhere else.
[71:49.94]You don't got it.
[71:51.26]Go to bathroom.
[71:52.06]The bathroom.
[71:52.80]Okay.
[71:53.58]Run.
[71:53.80]Yes.
[71:59.10]Smash mirror.
[71:59.96]Okay, now you can leave.
[72:09.57]What is it?
[72:12.49]Shutter 2.
[72:15.01]Do you?
[72:15.21]Let's see.
[72:15.65]What did she understand?
[72:17.19]Leave.
[72:39.28]Leave quickly.
[72:41.88]Leave.
[72:43.54]Hallway.
[72:45.08]Run.
[72:52.86]What an odd game.
[72:54.92]Strangely enough though, this works way better than any game that's tried to do this 10-15 years later.
[73:04.36]Hello?
[73:05.66]Operator?
[73:06.58]What?
[73:06.96]Wait, I'm hearing another voice.
[73:15.22]Who is this?
[73:17.70]Hello?
[73:18.02]Hello?
[73:23.03]Operator, can you hear me?
[73:24.59]There's definitely someone calling for help.
[73:26.67]There's someone else alive out there.
[73:32.49]Alright, well, let's... Where are we going to go?
[73:34.59]Shudder?
[73:35.11]We need some guests from 2.
[73:35.95]Hold on.
[73:39.52]Come on.
[73:44.42]Come on.
[73:44.86]I need to know what happens when I do this.
[73:54.56]Ugh.
[73:54.68]I was going to just sneeze.
[73:58.30]Hold on.
[74:02.82]Okay, I'll walk.
[74:11.52]Yes.
[74:13.42]Let's see if Shido can give some commands.
[74:21.73]You listen to me... This should open a shutter for us.
[74:24.57]Half the time.
[74:26.53]You listen to Shido completely.
[74:28.77]Hurry up and analyze.
[74:34.32]I'll go back.
[74:36.38]No, Shido, don't tell... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[74:38.44]I'm gonna override you here, Shido.
[74:40.60]Go back.
[74:41.16]Yep.
[74:41.94]Back to panel.
[74:47.32]No, we already looked under the bed.
[74:48.54]There's nothing under the bed.
[74:49.98]No, we looked under the bed already.
[74:52.34]Okay.
[74:54.10]Hurry up and analyze.
[74:57.18]Analyze shutter panel.
[74:59.10]It's okay.
[75:00.24]This control panel can be operated on your end.
[75:04.07]I'll get it.
[75:05.25]No, wait.
[75:07.03]The auto-control emergency shutter can now be opened and closed.
[75:10.60]Open it.
[75:16.44]Give Shido a turn.
[75:20.44]No, no, I have to do this.

[75:47.60]Let's see how well Shido does.
[75:50.96]I'm just going to take a backseat here.
[75:52.56]There's going to be a Shido stream for about five minutes.
[75:56.96]You ready?
[75:57.30]Okay.
[75:58.75]Okay.
[76:09.59]You can say it a little louder.
[76:10.37]What do you want me to try to say?
[76:17.59]What are you trying to say here?
[76:25.17]Try something else because she's obviously not getting it.
[76:27.47]OK.
[76:39.94]I know, I understand.
[76:44.37]Look, the game is trying to listen to you.
[76:46.55]I know it's finicky sometimes.
[76:49.43]Maybe you're speaking too high.
[76:50.95]Go a little bit lower.
[76:58.86]I don't think this is gonna... Alright, alright.
[77:03.18]Settle down.
[77:03.66]Settle down!
[77:04.22]I understand.
[77:06.04]I know the game sucks.
[77:07.14]That's fine.
[77:07.86]You're freaking out.
[77:11.57]Okay, it's not going to hear you.
[77:12.87]Just go back to bed.
[77:14.77]Go back to bed.
[77:19.10]Let me take over.
[77:21.38]Okay.

[79:51.08]Yeah, this is simple.
[79:52.06]We're just going to run... Look, we speedrun on this.
[79:55.20]Go to bathroom.
[79:55.92]Run.
[80:05.98]Oh fuck, we have to do this again.

[80:36.68]No skipping cutscenes.
[80:59.80]Can't wait to do this shit again.
[81:00.92]Damn it!
[81:02.18]I need to s- I gotta remember, this PlayStation 2, you gotta save it every time you do something.
[81:10.47]Oh, fuck.
[81:10.73]No!
[81:10.81]What have I done?
[81:19.40]Wait a minute.
[81:20.32]The monitors are live?
[81:21.82]Which ones?
[81:23.04]Who's the operator anyway?
[81:24.78]There's more than one camera.
[81:25.74]There's like five cameras in these rooms.
[81:26.99]He says he's a guest at the hotel.
[81:28.25]He's stuck in the monitor room.
[81:31.77]Huh.
[81:33.17]Is that right?
[81:33.85]Use Shito to voice act.
[81:34.95]Well, that sucks for him, doesn't it?
[81:36.95]Shito can only be around for like ten minutes per stream.
[81:39.99]Well, what the hell is a guest doing in the monitor room?
[81:42.73]Mr. Shinoka, pardon me.
[81:45.07]What's the status on the moving?
[81:48.71]On moving to Vegas?
[82:13.15]I've been here for a few months.
[82:19.49]Moved in October.

[82:32.09]Save it for someone who cares.
[82:33.35]Alright.
[82:43.68]You told me to go rescue the guests?
[82:45.60]Maybe he's the one who needs help.
[82:47.03]Grab the thing.
[82:47.47]We're gonna save it.
[82:48.81]We're ready to go.
[82:49.65]What should we do now?
[82:53.59]Go to bathroom.

[89:43.42]Footsteps.
[89:49.34]Somebody is coming.
[89:57.64]whoa Gino Rio Gino how'd you get out of that holding cell I had an operator open it for me that idiot inside the cell no alien would have reached you why is everybody died
[90:18.89]It'll take a lot more than those aliens to kill me.
[90:22.06]I'm just a streamer.
[90:23.04]Aliens?
[90:24.02]So those are aliens?
[90:24.90]Yeah, I was watching Jerma985.
[90:26.62]Fucking idiot.
[90:27.92]Hey, the good news is that a shuttle with a rescue team is on the way.
[90:31.80]I ran into a researcher in the testing ward, and he said they'd caught a radio signal.
[90:37.90]I've got to tell the others about this right away.
[90:43.11]Hey, operator, look after her, okay?
[90:47.14]Oh yeah, here.
[90:48.30]Take this.
[90:50.02]It's the voice password for one of the suites.
[90:52.32]The researcher I met.
[90:53.42]He's hiding in the sun suite.
[90:55.64]Alright, sun suite.
[90:56.34]I'm gonna keep looking for survivors.
[90:58.32]Make your way to the receiving port, got it?
[91:00.45]And be extra careful.
[91:01.63]Let's go, let's go.
[91:02.57]I gotta save the game.
[91:08.77]The sun suite.
[91:11.07]I think it's down this way.
[91:13.28]If it's a voice password, just tell her.
[91:15.84]If you could forget it.
[91:18.80]The rescue team is headed for the receiving port.
[91:24.19]But the receiving port is on the other side of that spider monster.
[91:28.29]So we gotta go the other way.
[91:29.11]There's no way I can get through there.
[91:31.77]Anyway, we should search every room.
[91:35.07]Searching for Naomi and Helen, the reporter.
[91:37.13]That's our top priority.
[91:38.19]Alright, so we're across here.
[91:43.43]We need to go to... Room 2, Room 3.
[91:45.65]These are the two rooms, so we got...

[92:31.96]Hurry up.
[92:40.58]Alright, we're safe.
[92:45.80]Hour and 36 minutes?
[92:46.76]That's not even true.
[92:55.60]Hour and 36 minutes?
[92:57.40]Is it?
[93:01.36]Alright, get up.

[167:52.61]But with hypercarbon alloy, it only needs to be a meter.
[168:08.80]The research lab here is for undertaking studies to develop even tougher alloys.
[168:13.60]Nothing to do with aliens.
[168:15.28]And anyway, it's scientifically irrational that test animals grow to such extreme sizes.
[168:22.48]If you're so interested in our research, I'll give you some reference material.
[168:31.71]You ran into that spider, right?
[168:34.43]Uh, uh-huh.
[168:36.30]How did you get away from it?
[168:37.60]Please, tell me.
[168:40.04]How to kill the spider.
[168:44.01]With that.
[168:45.43]But it's out of fuel now.
[168:46.75]New weapon.
[168:47.13]Is it a flamethrower?
[168:47.75]That thing is huge.
[168:49.15]Do I get to flamethrow mirrors now?
[168:50.15]But it seems to share similarities with Earth's arthropod, a spider.
[168:53.57]So I scared it off with fire.
[168:56.11]So it's vulnerable against fire.
[168:58.45]Uh-huh.
[168:59.77]Until help arrives, I'm holing up in here.
[169:02.56]Earlier, Research Supervisor Powers sent a rescue signal.
[169:07.06]Powers told me to spread the word, so I came to tell the others, but... Because of that monster spider.
[169:13.76]You can't make it to the receiving port?
[169:16.86]Bingo!
[169:17.64]It's a nasty obstacle.
[169:20.13]So, uh, how about it?
[169:22.21]Wanna play dead with me?
[169:24.65]I'm going.
[169:25.21]That's a creepy thing to ask anybody.
[169:26.35]I have a partner backing me up.
[169:27.51]You wanna play dead with me?
[169:28.93]Right?
[169:29.39]Like, what the fuck does that... What are you talking about?
[169:31.73]Well, hang on.
[169:33.05]Take this with you.
[169:37.89]Shutter key.
[169:41.71]Do you really intend to just play dead?
[169:44.89]Please refrain from talking to me.
[169:47.31]Why would you?
[169:47.81]Why are you doing this?
[169:51.31]The research supervisor really sent for help.
[169:54.31]You're just gonna go back to lying on the ground.
[169:58.35]That means everyone will gather in the receiving port.
[170:02.20]What the fuck?
[170:03.26]Gino said that he'd tell the others.
[170:05.42]Both Helen and Naomi may be at the receiving port.
[170:10.33]I think we should be making our way to the receiving port, too.
[170:12.91]How many times can you say receiving port in the save?
[170:14.71]We have to get rid of that monster spider if I'm gonna get to the receiving port.
[170:17.85]There's five.
[170:18.65]That flamethrower Alan had.
[170:21.11]It came from the equipment room.
[170:22.83]There should be more of the same.
[170:25.49]Yep.
[170:26.59]I think we better check out the equipment room.
[170:28.23]For the receiving port.
[170:30.45]Oh no, you changed it to equipment room.
[170:31.73]Alright.
[170:32.57]Looks like we have to go to the equipment room.
[170:37.72]Leave.
[170:38.62]Yes.
[170:39.78]Run.
[170:40.84]Leave.
[170:41.86]Hallway.
[170:45.75]Save point.
[170:47.13]Run.
[170:52.65]Do I have a key?
[170:53.55]I don't think I have one of those door opening keys.
[171:12.12]Oh, it gave one to me.
[171:23.00]I am stopped.
[171:24.08]Up.
[171:26.74]The bed, okay?
[171:27.68]Out.
[171:30.28]Do a hallway.
[171:31.62]Okay.
[171:31.98]Run.
[171:32.50]Yes.
[171:49.03]Need to go to the equipment.
[171:52.89]Alright.
[171:55.85]Shutter 2.
[171:57.55]Run.
[171:59.27]Run.
[171:59.97]Uh.
[172:11.56]Alright.
[172:14.18]Equipment room.
[172:14.94]Activate the flamethrower.
[172:17.00]Flamethrow the spider.
[172:19.95]Hurry up and analyze.
[172:23.25]Jeez.
[172:24.73]Pushy.
[172:28.30]Are there two?
[172:29.10]There should be a flamethrower in the equipment room.
[172:32.34]Check.
[172:34.92]Hey.
[172:35.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[172:35.86]I didn't tell you to do that.
[172:38.42]Since when do you make decisions on your own?
[172:43.61]It's getting dark.
[172:45.41]The power must be weakening.
[172:50.82]We always confer with each other.
[172:52.24]Where was that camera?
[172:53.64]Did you see that crane shot?
[172:56.80]Where was she looking?
[172:57.36]What camera was that?
[172:59.20]Am I like a floating little robot?
[173:00.22]See?
[173:19.28]I think we have to give up on that flamethrower.
[173:22.71]There's no fuel.
[173:24.41]The tank is empty.
[173:26.37]There's nothing we can do.
[173:28.91]To get to the other side of that shutter, we have to kill that spider.
[173:34.66]The flamethrower that Alan had been using is worthless now.
[173:38.30]What?
[173:39.80]That giant spider is vulnerable to fire.
[173:44.68]Let's look for a weapon that involves fire.
[173:47.18]You mean a flamethrower?
[173:47.94]That's the only thing we can do.
[173:49.12]Did they just not want to develop the fire coming out of the flamethrower?
[173:58.47]Hey, what's an item that uses fire and can do fire damage?
[174:01.93]A flamethrower.
[174:02.91]Well, no, but we can't use that, so what else does fire?
[174:06.51]I don't know.
[174:07.49]A fire?
[174:08.59]Start a fire.
[174:09.27]Where are you going?
[174:11.47]Supply unit.
[174:12.67]The supply unit.
[174:13.67]Okay.
[174:16.74]Oh god.
[174:18.82]Left boxes, check.
[174:20.00]Item on top of the shelf.
[174:23.34]Selective shooting, for some reason.
[174:30.74]Item on left shelf.
[174:45.46]Have you forgotten that I work here?
[174:47.88]Don't expect me to go shooting the hotel's supplies.
[174:53.02]Get on scaffolding.
[174:55.08]Jeez, you're expecting me to pick up everything, aren't you?
[174:57.72]No way, I can't pick that up.
[175:02.67]Get on... the... Okay.
[175:07.59]Let's check what's up top.
[175:09.27]Okay, you've got the controls.
[175:17.18]Up we go.
[175:26.07]That would hurt.
[175:39.38]That would hurt really bad.
[175:46.65]Smashed her head against the ceiling.
[175:49.79]Alright, what am I looking for?
[175:50.77]Stay there!
[175:51.27]I'm not doing anything.
[175:53.95]Oh my god, I'm not doing anything, I swear to god.
[176:00.95]Stop.
[176:14.09]The middle shelf?
[176:15.21]I can't stop at the middle shelf.
[176:24.67]This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[176:31.42]Press enter.
[176:33.74]This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[176:39.08]Enter.
[176:40.16]Okay.
[176:41.18]Then lower the lift.
[176:48.70]This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[176:51.62]I did, I'm sorry.
[176:52.54]Get off.
[176:54.79]Look.
[176:55.53]Forward.
[176:55.73]This lift is scary, so don't say anything weird, please.
[176:59.51]Check.
[177:01.96]There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.
[177:08.08]What?
[177:08.44]I can't go right.
[177:09.14]Why not?
[177:10.16]Why not?
[177:10.74]Check.
[177:39.07]I looked carefully, but there's nothing here that we need.
[177:47.79]Nothing?
[177:48.21]Check.
[177:50.33]There's nothing on the shelf that we can use for lighting a fire.
[177:58.30]I said the middle shelf is suspicious.
[178:01.59]Listen.
[178:02.53]Listen.
[178:03.82]I know you probably don't get this, but I can't put you in the middle.
[178:08.98]For some reason, it won't let me.
[178:10.40]Stop.
[178:11.68]Go back to supply unit.
[178:12.40]Run.
[178:12.50]So this... Get on.
[178:30.75]Okay.
[178:31.84]Let's check what's up top.
[178:33.46]Okay, you've got the controls.
[178:42.50]Jump.
[178:50.61]You'd think I could just go this way from here.
[178:54.65]No!
[178:55.43]That was too close.
[178:56.23]Control it better.
[179:06.99]Use, check, check, check, check, check.
[179:14.39]I can't, I... Use the X button?
[179:17.05]No, enter doesn't do anything.
[179:27.90]There is no, like, enter.
[179:30.40]Wait, there's something suspicious about that shelf I just passed.
[179:45.94]Go diagonal.
[179:55.30]Try from the left again.
[179:56.50]Whoa!
[180:11.78]That was too close!
[180:12.66]Control it better!
[180:16.72]Can I do this?
[180:19.94]Enter on the PlayStation 2 controller is... What, though?
[180:23.54]None of these buttons do anything.
[180:24.62]Circle is talk.
[180:24.92]Diagonally?
[180:25.14]Okay.
[180:25.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[180:27.02]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[180:46.57]What?
[180:47.01]No way that that works.
[180:50.08]There's no way that that works.
[180:51.76]Are you serious?
[180:56.10]Oh, come on!
[181:14.82]It actually fucking works.
[181:20.06]There's no way I would have been able to ever assume that I could go diagonal.
[181:24.52]I've got four, one, two, three, four.
[181:30.97]Check.
[181:31.27]I can't believe it.
[181:33.73]Check.
[181:44.00]This magnesium chip.
[181:48.02]Let's see, what does it say?
[181:50.02]Warnings for magnesium chip usage.
[181:52.92]One, keep out of reach of children.
[181:56.00]Two, avoid direct sunlight and temperature over 50 degrees Celsius.
[182:01.27]Do not incinerate.
[182:03.15]Three, hold away from face while igniting and confirm that it is extinguished.
[182:08.65]Four, that's enough, huh?
[182:11.57]In other words, it's like a lighter.
[182:13.72]It won't make a weapon, but I can use it for lighting a fire.
[182:17.24]So, throw that.
[182:18.98]What the hell is that thing called?
[182:19.98]Magnesium.
[182:20.60]I got the magnesium.
[182:26.75]Off.
[182:28.25]I can't check a shelf properly unless I'm squarely in front of it.
[182:34.01]Get off.
[182:34.95]Yes, maybe we should go somewhere else.
[182:38.79]So I'm gonna have to say, like, throw magnesium at Spider.
[182:41.89]So we got supply unit... food unit.
[182:44.08]Run.
[182:44.36]This is another one of these dumb scaffolding puzzles.
[182:50.80]Okay.
[182:59.06]It's apparently that easy.
[183:08.84]Mechanical unit.
[183:10.51]Run.
[183:11.09]Oh, no.
[183:11.47]Ugh, flamethrower, shelf, shelf, power panel, out of order.
[183:28.24]Fix power panel.
[183:34.40]Utility unit.
[183:35.62]Run.
[183:36.22]Run.
[183:36.44]Get on.
[183:36.88]Do I?
[184:04.73]I do.
[184:08.33]Voltage at 50%.
[184:09.15]The power supply is unstable.
[184:10.31]Please raise the voltage to 100.
[184:11.35]Can I not move at all?
[184:32.77]There's no- I can't go anywhere.
[184:33.85]I think I have to raise the power.
[184:35.72]No.
[184:35.88]Nothing works.
[184:38.44]Check.
[184:41.72]So, how is this even possible?
[185:05.32]I mean, hop from here?
[185:07.06]No.
[185:07.77]From here?
[185:08.39]No.
[185:08.53]I gotta get off.
[185:09.21]Get off.
[185:10.07]Turn the other one off.
[185:11.37]Supply unit.
[185:12.55]Okay.
[185:36.66]Maybe that'll defer power?
[185:39.90]Utility unit.
[185:41.66]Utility unit.
[185:43.22]I gotcha.
[185:44.06]Run.
[185:44.66]The shelf on the other side.
[185:47.50]Run.
[185:48.76]Run.
[185:49.60]Yes.
[185:58.87]Did it say the power?
[186:00.83]Get on.
[186:02.59]Okay.
[186:03.67]Let's check what's up top.
[186:05.31]Okay, you've got the controls.
[186:07.74]I wonder if that worked.
[186:13.40]Yeah.
[186:14.34]It did.
[186:14.60]Wow.
[186:16.14]That's pretty remarkable, actually.
[186:19.04]Check.
[186:20.45]This... It's a chip.
[186:27.23]That's pretty sweet.
[186:32.09]Check.
[186:34.37]I looked carefully, but there's nothing here that we need.
[186:40.21]Am I gonna run into a wall here?
[186:41.59]No.
[186:42.07]Nothing else?
[186:44.39]Check.
[186:44.57]I think that's it.
[186:45.17]Jesus.
[186:45.33]Get off.
[187:06.43]So that was data unit.
[187:09.62]Data unit.
[187:11.68]Run.
[187:17.02]Uh... Check note.
[187:21.72]Oh, that's the... That's the thing that describes... That's the solution to the puzzle.
[187:31.56]Okay.
[187:32.06]Well, that's great.
[187:33.86]Look at left.
[187:37.59]How am I supposed to understand that?
[187:41.35]What is that thing?
[187:42.53]Look at dolly.
[187:43.65]Leave the room?
[187:44.59]No.
[187:45.37]Okay.
[187:46.89]Stop.
[187:48.89]Go back.
[187:49.29]Stop.
[187:49.91]Yep.
[187:50.85]Go to data panel.
[187:52.29]The data unit.
[187:53.51]Okay.
[187:55.82]Check left panel.
[188:00.62]No go.
[188:01.49]It's not working properly because it's not getting enough power.
[188:05.65]If this was working properly, it would have been easy to check this room.
[188:09.95]Um... Okay.
[188:15.11]Look at platform.
[188:19.34]It's a cart for delivering supplies to various sections.
[188:22.44]It's for staff use.
[188:25.54]That's it.
[188:26.04]Alright.
[188:26.28]I think we can get out of here.
[188:28.30]Save point.
[188:29.54]Okay, the save point.
[188:32.96]We got the fire, we can kill the bug.
[188:34.35]Mine Bitcoin.
[188:41.23]I'm not gonna say that.
[189:01.10]Get up.
[189:02.04]Okay, I got it already.
[189:03.13]Into the hallway.
[189:04.35]Okay, I'll leave.
[189:07.19]Go.
[189:08.99]Did you say something?
[189:09.89]Hallway.
[189:10.61]Okay, I'll leave.
[189:21.03]Be nice to her.
[189:24.77]So now... We... Go to infirmary.
[189:30.30]The infirmary.
[189:31.34]Okay.
[189:45.05]This is the infirmary.
[189:48.41]This is actually the first time I've ever been here.
[189:53.83]Haha, that'd be funny, haha.
[189:55.65]Haha, what?
[189:57.11]A way to kill that spider.
[189:59.91]I already have it.
[190:01.13]Listen, operator.
[190:03.51]What do you associate with an infirmary?
[190:05.99]Can you name the sorts of things that you'd find in an infirmary?
[190:09.53]Uh, sure.
[190:10.17]Um... Medicine.
[190:14.89]Medicine.
[190:16.11]In a room this big, there should be all sorts.
[190:19.67]Anything else?
[190:22.90]Um... A doctor.
[190:27.04]Yep.
[190:27.94]You bet.
[190:28.36]There'd be a doctor.
[190:29.40]Definitely.
[190:30.54]Are there any others?
[190:33.88]Turkey.
[190:37.67]Thanksgiving turkey.
[190:38.89]Christmas turkey.
[190:44.33]A football.
[190:45.35]Tell me some things you'd find in an infirmary.
[190:49.51]A lawyer.
[190:51.71]Oh.
[190:52.67]Barium.
[190:54.55]I absolutely loathe the idea.
[190:56.19]Did she just say... Can't they find a better way to... Bario?
[191:00.00]Come on, more guesses.
[191:00.90]Barrio?
[191:08.50]Surgery tools.
[191:10.87]Uh, yeah.
[191:11.97]Bedpan.
[191:15.49]Are there any more?
[191:18.45]Yes, Dora.
[191:19.11]Let me see.
[191:25.04]Uh... Syringes.
[191:28.83]A syringe.
[191:30.31]I hate them.
[191:31.51]Can you manage one more guess?
[191:45.27]Stuff you'd find in an infirmary.
[191:50.99]Uh... Alcohol?
[191:53.45]No.
[191:55.66]I mean, alcohol, but not really.
[192:00.62]Alcohol.
[192:02.32]Yeah, disinfectant always stings on cuts or scrapes.
[192:06.87]Um... Yeah, let's see.
[192:09.93]Being a medical room, there should be chemicals here.
[192:14.69]Chemicals.
[192:15.73]Um... A flamethrower.
[192:21.47]Oh.
[192:23.58]Listen, operator.
[192:24.94]There's gotta be a weapon we can use to kill that spider.
[192:29.03]Chemical fire.
[192:30.13]Alright, let's put it together.
[192:31.37]It's, uh, that weapon's name.
[192:35.15]A flamethrower.
[192:35.95]What was it now?
[192:36.97]You don't remember the flamethrower?
[192:40.89]What was its name now?
[192:42.85]I can't talk.

[192:45.83]I can't remember.

[193:18.42]Hit the monster with a stick.
[193:20.46]No, a stick won't do it.

[193:22.41]Yes, that's it.
[193:26.29]A weapon you can make using medicine.
[193:27.97]No, hit it with a stick.

[193:38.95]Um... That weapon that burned... A battle axe.
[193:43.45]Was it an axe or something like it?
[193:47.65]That burning weapon, what was it?
[193:49.83]A burning axe.
[193:51.27]That's enough about axes.
[193:53.39]An ice enchanted axe.
[193:55.01]That burning weapon, what was it?
[193:58.33]A +2 lightning axe.

[194:49.98]A weapon that uses alcohol.
[194:51.81]A bomb.
[194:52.95]Handguns and stuff.
[194:56.99]A weapon that burns with alcohol.

[195:09.92]Molotov cocktail.
[195:13.35]That's it, operator.
[195:14.88]Sword.
[195:15.32]There should be alcohol in every medical room.
[195:17.48]We'll find some alcohol and make a Molotov cocktail.
[195:21.36]Okay, let's look for some alcohol.
[195:23.84]Imagine how fucking stupid you would sound if I'm an operator sitting in a room by myself and this girl is here alone.
[195:32.15]There's all kinds of fucking creatures and monsters and weirdos.
[195:36.35]And she's asking me for help on what they can make for a weapon and I'm leaning in going, you should find a sword.
[195:41.23]You should find a sword.
[195:44.52]Like, how much of a fucking idiot would you have to be?
[195:51.52]Operating table.
[195:53.48]A stick.

[197:03.67]You are dumb.
[197:05.25]Phew.

[197:18.93]It's a bed for resting.
[197:20.57]It doesn't appear to have been used at all.
[197:24.73]That's it?
[197:25.99]There's nothing here.
[197:27.83]Let's look elsewhere.
[197:28.55]There's nothing in the bed, nothing in the operating table.

[197:46.81]It's from an employee checkup.
[197:53.85]You're never going to get an x-ray?
[197:57.89]That's... That's really not that smart to say that.
[198:04.26]I fell off my skateboard and I think I might have broke my arm.
[198:06.80]We need to see where the brake is so we can determine if we need to do anything about it.
[198:10.04]No, I'm not doing x-rays.

[204:31.09]Yes, you will.
[204:32.65]Okay.
[204:37.21]Here we go again.
[204:38.19]Now you can disengage the locks.
[204:43.46]Can I?
[204:47.88]Open it up.
[204:53.35]This is just a liquor store cabinet.
[204:57.73]This is the beer and wine section of the grocery store.
[205:01.35]Grab a fucking 12-pack of cider while we're at it.
[205:03.65]Oh, it is alcohol.
[205:08.11]Ah, okay.
[205:08.41]Never mind.
[205:09.55]That's right.
[205:16.73]Let me see.
[205:22.59]Alan said that the spider is vulnerable to fire, but he was using a flamethrower.
[205:29.58]I wonder if a Molotov cocktail would really do the job.
[205:33.40]It is fire, so yes.
[205:34.56]But there's no choice.
[205:36.26]This will have to do.
[205:39.50]Hey, operator.
[205:41.93]I'm finding it a little hard to believe those monsters are actually aliens.
[205:46.67]I mean, imagine it.
[205:48.67]Aliens attacking people.
[205:50.25]What do you think they are?
[205:51.51]This isn't a movie.
[205:53.89]And... Do you think they're, like, parrots?
[205:56.09]No, it's okay.
[205:56.77]Dogs?
[205:57.33]Cats?
[205:57.57]What do you think these are?
[205:58.27]It's fine.
[206:00.17]Anyways, we have to do something about the spider first.
[206:04.59]It's not a spider.
[206:06.37]It's clearly a huge fucking alien with green eyes.
[206:10.87]And a giant tongue.
[206:12.21]Okay.
[206:14.27]Now we can go exterminate that monster spider.
[206:16.43]Alright.
[206:17.91]We also found that magnesium chip in the equipment room.
[206:21.92]We're ready to fight that spider, right?
[206:24.26]I hope so.
[206:25.12]Then let's go.
[206:31.79]There is a couple... Hold on.
[206:34.29]No, no, no.
[206:34.93]Go to case four.
[206:35.97]Case four.
[206:36.97]Okay.
[206:39.27]Okay.
[206:40.12]I'll use the ID card.
[206:47.34]Okay.
[206:48.40]Now you can disengage the locks.
[206:49.74]There's probably more stuff to get... I need to... Hopefully I can replace a heal.
[206:54.18]Because I accidentally used one, and I didn't even mean to.
[206:57.29]Any heals?
[207:03.67]Great.
[207:04.43]Just one.
[207:09.63]Head.

[207:18.54]Back.
[207:19.58]Back.
[207:20.50]Dodge left.
[207:22.71]Target enemy two.
[207:24.39]Back.
[207:25.89]Back.
[207:27.35]Dodge left.
[207:28.68]Dodge left.
[207:30.38]Back.
[207:31.04]Shake.

[207:33.30]Dodge right.
[207:34.64]Back.
[207:35.50]Back.
[207:36.76]Dodge left.
[207:37.75]Back.
[207:38.99]Enemy one.

[213:47.47]Okay, let's look for some alcohol.
[213:50.73]Where should I begin looking?
[213:54.37]Save point.
[213:55.69]The save point.
[213:56.31]Run.
[213:56.81]Yes.
[214:03.63]God.
[214:14.40]You guys gotta spam.
[214:17.51]I'm gonna encourage chat spam.
[214:20.09]Because when I get to a new room and we do a couple of activities, all I want to see over here is save the game.
[214:28.67]Every 20 to 30 minutes, just spam it.
[214:32.45]That's the only time I'll ever encourage it.
[214:36.74]Rock backwards.
[214:38.48]Yes.
[214:44.35]Dance.
[214:47.09]Okay.
[214:48.79]Dance.
[214:49.83]Okay.
[214:50.65]Can you dance?
[214:51.96]Okay.
[214:52.38]Do you know how to dance?
[214:53.94]The desk.
[214:54.76]Okay.
[214:54.98]Stop.
[214:55.68]Yes.
[214:56.82]Do you like to dance?
[214:58.58]The desk.
[214:59.06]Stop.
[214:59.40]Okay.
[214:59.80]Yes.
[215:00.14]Dance.
[215:01.18]Okay.
[215:10.07]Do a dance.
[215:11.69]The desk.
[215:12.51]Okay.
[215:13.07]Go ahead.
[215:20.41]Left drawer.
[215:24.29]Shoes?
[215:24.81]I'm not gonna say that, okay?
[215:28.52]Because it'll... It's not gonna do anything.
[215:32.70]Do you think the developers of this 2004 PlayStation 2 game thought to put that in for any reason?
[215:48.70]She doesn't even dance.
[215:50.40]Okay.
[215:53.72]Sing.
[215:55.74]Sing a song.
[215:57.22]Are you talking about this?
[215:58.44]That is actually, yeah.
[216:01.22]Open the cabinet.
[216:02.90]It's already open.
[216:05.49]Check cabinet.
[216:07.99]Hmm.
[216:09.55]There's only anti-nausea medication.
[216:12.15]Nothing in there, okay.
[216:13.67]X-rays.
[216:15.95]It's from an employee checkup.
[216:21.49]Not for me, thanks.
[216:27.83]Case two.
[216:30.18]Are you talking about this?
[216:33.24]Case two.
[216:34.26]Case two.
[216:34.88]Run.
[216:35.46]Okay.
[216:36.72]Run.
[216:45.23]Huh.
[216:46.27]It's locked.
[216:47.33]It won't open.
[216:49.32]You guys are fucking crazy.
[216:51.10]Alright.
[216:52.52]Use ID card on... Use ID card.
[216:56.30]I just saved it.
[216:56.96]We're good.
[217:21.93]I'm gonna be calm about this.
[217:25.02]Back.
[217:25.50]Back.
[217:26.40]Back.

[218:17.92]Got it.
[218:19.04]Time to save.
[218:26.39]Save point.
[218:26.79]Run.
[218:27.47]Yes.
[218:40.49]Number of commands, 1,085.
[218:42.39]That's a lot of commands.
[218:53.61]Case 3.
[218:57.04]Case 3.
[218:58.22]Okay.
[219:03.82]Okay.
[219:04.70]I'll use the ID card.
[219:07.26]Good.
[219:13.38]Disengage, and then I'm just getting out of here.
[219:18.68]I opened up the other case, and got attacked by very difficult monsters, and it killed me.
[219:25.37]Huh?
[219:27.15]This?
[219:39.89]Here it is.
[219:41.27]Alcohol.
[219:43.57]Alcohol.
[219:45.19]Got it.
[219:45.65]Save game.
[219:51.34]Let me see.
[219:51.94]Drink alcohol.
[219:57.20]Alan said that the spider is vulnerable to fire.
[220:00.99]But he was using a flamethrower.
[220:04.19]I wonder if a Molotov cocktail would really do the job.
[220:09.26]Yeah.
[220:09.44]Me too.
[220:09.84]No.
[220:10.87]That would be weird if this was a movie.
[220:15.17]Mhm.
[220:41.86]It's finished.
[220:44.98]Great.
[220:46.80]Okay.
[220:48.87]Now we can go exterminate that monster spider.
[220:50.91]Throw Molotov into ceiling.
[220:52.51]We also found that magnesium chip in the equipment room.
[220:56.51]We're ready to fight that spider, right?
[220:59.71]Then let's go.
[221:03.80]Safe point.
[221:04.82]The safe point.
[221:05.76]Okay.
[221:06.58]Yes.
[221:17.07]$10.90.
[221:23.43]Sweet!
[221:32.10]Get up.
[221:33.08]Hallway.
[221:33.68]Run.
[221:46.83]We tried sexy pose.
[221:48.49]It didn't do anything.
[221:53.25]I'm fully prepared to defeat that spider.
[221:56.37]It's on the other side of shutter four.
[221:59.15]I'm ready.
[222:03.91]Shutter four.
[222:05.58]Shutter four.
[222:06.46]Okay.
[222:07.20]Run.
[222:09.50]Run.
[222:10.20]Yes.
[222:11.76]Sprint.
[222:14.02]You can only run.
[222:26.38]So I got the Molotov Cocktail.
[222:29.12]Open and throw Molotov Cocktail at Spider.
[222:42.13]Here we go.
[222:52.05]I'm just holding it in my hand.
[222:53.73]I'm so ready.
[222:54.15]Mm-hmm.
[222:54.37]Open door.
[222:54.69]Door's not open.
[223:20.78]The door isn't open.
[223:21.48]Operator, listen carefully.
[223:24.67]I'm gonna throw the Molotov cocktail right into that spider creature's mouth.
[223:29.05]Listen, the bottle's too heavy to throw very far, and I need to time my throw with the opening of the bottle.
[223:34.39]It's gonna explode!
[223:36.09]I need you to watch the spider's movements on your monitor and give me the signal to throw.
[223:42.04]When you give the signal, I'll throw the Molotov cocktail.
[223:44.96]What?
[223:45.24]If I wave this around, the spider won't be too eager to get close.
[223:50.31]There's only one Molotov cocktail.
[223:53.99]If we blow it, I'm as good as dead.
[223:58.93]Okay, it's time to waste that spider.
[224:00.41]This is giving me anxiety.
[224:01.47]I don't like the alcohol in there.
[224:05.15]Here we go.
[224:05.83]Open the shutter.
[224:08.19]Still there.
[224:14.21]Alright, throw the Molotov when it gets close enough.
[224:35.71]Get closer.
[224:38.27]Walk closer.
[224:43.56]Throw it.
[224:52.08]I got it.
[224:58.10]She fell forward.
[225:21.46]She also threw that less than 10 feet.
[225:23.10]Well done.
[225:24.42]Kudos to you.
[225:25.32]Here's the mad doctor.
[225:28.86]That thing kept me from reaching the receiving port.
[225:32.36]I was concerned.
[225:33.45]Thank you.
[225:34.49]I appreciate your resourcefulness.
[225:38.77]Is something the matter?
[225:39.88]I don't like your condescending tone.
[225:43.12]Don't patronize me.
[225:46.58]How delightfully forthright of you to say.
[225:49.58]And what is your name?
[225:51.08]It's on my name tag.
[225:51.66]It's the guy from the stock photos.
[225:53.38]Who are you?
[225:55.09]Oh my, so very brusque.
[225:57.51]Well, it can't be helped after facing such a fearsome creature.
[226:00.77]I don't see it.
[226:01.77]Unfortunately, I am partly to blame.
[226:04.48]My name is Joe Powers.
[226:06.42]I'm the research supervisor of the testing ward.
[226:10.84]What happened here isn't a total surprise.
[226:13.96]Much of this was top secret.
[226:15.58]You see, my assistant, Alan, became aware of an approaching UFO last year.
[226:20.22]Nobody believed him, but me.
[226:23.17]I had opposed the opening of this hotel, but JSL refused to heed my warnings.
[226:28.49]In preparation for possible disaster, I kept a rescue team on standby.
[226:32.89]They're on their way here now.
[226:34.81]You should make your way to the receiving port.
[226:36.41]I will catch up after I find Alan.
[226:40.15]I found your assistant unconscious in the sun suite.
[226:44.14]Goodness.
[226:45.14]Is Alan safe?
[226:47.22]I wouldn't know.
[226:47.84]It's the most movement I've seen a character do in this game.
[226:51.20]You need to hurry.
[226:52.50]What?
[226:53.12]Oh, heavens.
[226:53.86]But that's terrible.
[227:06.20]He's the real monster.
[227:15.21]A major wobble was detected in the space station's rotation.
[227:19.45]The station was placed on emergency status, although the wobble will not interfere with its orbit.
[227:26.21]The gap section, however, had to be completely sealed off.
[227:29.59]Am I stuck in here?
[227:30.33]Is this gonna Indiana Jones closing on me or something?
[227:36.47]But good thing this section wasn't sealed off.
[227:41.03]Not much else we can do besides obtaining a Shudder key.
[227:45.33]Okay.
[227:47.11]Let's take a look at the map.
[227:51.22]So we got Shudder 5, this is the restrooms.
[227:56.90]Go to restrooms.
[227:58.22]Run.
[228:01.88]Don't worry, we'll get a sexy pose in the mirror, I promise.
[228:10.61]I'll do it.
[228:11.61]I'll do it if I don't have to see it anymore.
[228:16.78]The lights seem to be out in the back.
[228:21.52]Listen.
[228:22.60]Do you know the story?
[228:24.27]That if you die in space, your soul wanders through space forever?
[228:28.71]What are you talking about?
[228:29.87]The restroom in the guest section?
[228:32.51]Well, there are these spooky rumors.
[228:38.30]At night, even though there's supposed to be no one around, you can hear the sound of the music box.
[228:47.72]When they were building the outer wall of the station, there was an accident involving some workers, and three were lost.
[228:57.23]Two were miraculously rescued, but the last worker was never recovered.
[229:06.09]That worker...
[229:08.52]He's said to have worn a pendant with a family photo and a music box.
[229:12.52]Great and scary story.
[229:15.40]Listen, operator.
[229:17.78]How good are you with stories like this?
[229:20.70]It's a little scary for me.
[229:21.84]I don't know.
[229:22.76]I'm too scared.
[229:24.50]Why don't you understand?
[229:26.68]Well, anyway, it doesn't matter.
[229:27.84]It's not much of a story.
[229:36.59]The music box.
[229:38.15]Don't go down that hall.
[229:39.23]What was that sound?
[229:40.13]Don't move.
[229:45.12]It's the music box from the story.
[229:50.60]I... I must have imagined it.
[229:53.70]Yeah, me too.
[229:54.70]Sure, that's it.
[230:00.28]I didn't imagine it.
[230:02.09]I'm sure I heard it.
[230:03.37]The rumors...
[230:04.81]They must be true.
[230:05.73]The rumors have to be true.
[230:16.71]You could throw a Molotov cocktail down the throat of a giant spider alien fucking monster that was gonna kill you.
[230:23.40]But you can't walk into a bathroom.
[230:25.12]Go in.
[230:25.46]No!
[230:26.66]What?! !
[230:33.66]Oh my god.
[230:35.31]Save point.
[230:42.79]Spooky scary story music box versus my life is truly in immediate danger.
[230:49.13]I will die if I do not pull off this throw.
[230:54.80]Spooky scary sounds coming from the toilet.
[231:10.53]Go in the bathroom.
[231:12.27]What is this wall?
[231:21.86]Look in the bathroom.
[231:40.04]That's easy for you to say.
[231:43.06]Would it really be okay?
[231:47.30]It's going to be okay.
[231:49.26]So what?
[231:51.30]It's gonna be fine.
[231:54.72]Yeah, you're right.
[231:57.25]It's scary because we don't know what it is.
[232:00.43]Okay, I'll go.
[232:01.73]Good.
[232:05.79]Nothing in here.
[232:08.27]There's a couple of dirty toilets.
[232:09.69]And some urinals.
[232:20.42]Men's stalls.
[232:22.04]Run.
[232:22.32]Run.
[232:22.82]Run.
[232:23.30]Go.
[232:23.62]Go.
[232:24.04]Walk.
[232:41.13]What is going on?
[232:41.63]What's she doing?
[232:43.13]We're gonna play musical stalls.
[232:45.99]Open stall one.
[232:51.47]Okay, I'll open it.
[232:59.99]That's a pretty nice bathroom.
[233:03.23]Gold and toilet paper?
[233:06.15]Nothing here.
[233:09.61]Nope, nothing.
[233:11.07]We're done with this one.
[233:12.73]No problem.
[233:13.23]Reach hand inside toilet.
[233:16.37]Check stall two.
[233:21.77]Okay, I'll open it.
[233:25.78]Hurry up while you're at it.
[233:33.74]There's nothing here.

[267:16.03]Check.
[267:16.99]Note.
[267:17.67]There's... There's some writing on it.
[267:21.55]Read it.
[267:21.89]I think... Read it.
[267:23.67]Move.
[267:25.23]What exactly?
[267:26.61]Read the note.
[267:34.18]Wait.
[267:36.22]Wait a second.
[267:39.53]Rio, gotcha.
[267:41.94]That's me.
[267:43.36]Hey, was it scary?
[267:46.06]I made that story up.
[267:47.94]Who did?
[267:48.90]Huh?
[267:49.80]I thought that Rio would fall for it and come snooping.
[267:53.36]Please bring back my pendant from Meg.
[267:57.47]A prank?
[267:59.72]Didn't she say that... Didn't she say that it was like a story everybody told?
[268:05.18]Or was that Meg that told her that?
[268:08.02]She said of an elaborate prank for like ten years.
[268:10.42]I thought that was like a... urban legend or something.
[268:14.35]I'm not gonna take the pendant.
[268:31.91]Save point.
[268:46.50]Just leave it in there.
[268:51.14]Leave the pendant inside.
[268:57.68]Still better than a bad at-the-game joke?
[269:04.15]What?
[269:04.27]What are you talking about?
[269:06.29]You talking about me?
[269:07.63]Hallway.
[269:09.36]Hallway.
[269:10.52]Ah, yeah, that's right.
[269:22.06]The men's stall.
[269:24.14]I can open the shutter now.
[269:28.58]Moon Suite.
[269:32.06]She's gonna be too scared to go back.
[269:33.43]Bathroom.
[269:36.59]Which stall was it?
[269:37.95]Where are you going?
[269:41.97]Okay, well, never mind.
[269:59.12]She's not gonna sexy pose in the mirror.
[270:03.04]She's too scared in that bathroom.
[270:08.96]So we got guest room five, and then... That's it.
[270:11.96]Guest room five.
[270:12.78]Run.
[270:13.14]Consultation mode, then sexy pose vessel.

[271:29.51]Mouth.
[271:30.99]That was pretty tough.
[271:33.27]Let's go.
[271:33.69]That's Splishio.
[271:38.72]So where should I begin checking?
[271:39.64]It actually could be.
[271:41.44]Tell me, please.
[271:43.20]Consultation.
[271:46.80]Okay, consultation it is.
[271:50.50]Okay, what would you like to know about?
[271:52.52]Sexy pose.
[271:56.80]Sexy pose.
[271:58.10]Okay, that's it for consultation.
[272:12.22]Consultation.
[272:15.53]Okay.
[272:16.37]Consultation it is.
[272:19.24]Okay.
[272:19.94]What would you like to know about?
[272:20.94]Just hold on.
[272:28.97]If I move this down, does this screw up the rest of the frame, I wonder?
[272:50.44]I wonder if I ruin it.
[272:52.60]Yeah, it's ruined.
[272:58.31]I guess it has to have those bars, huh?
[273:01.13]Eh, maybe not necessarily.
[273:04.99]That's okay.
[273:05.55]He is.
[273:20.12]Alright, that looks better.
[273:22.58]Shoot lamp.
[273:23.56]We'll get out!
[273:24.34]Water.
[273:29.57]Use water.
[273:29.87]Bucket.
[273:51.30]It's just a bucket.
[273:55.57]Pick a bucket.
[273:57.87]The bucket is too close to the fire.
[274:00.09]I can't get it.
[274:03.99]Leave.
[274:04.71]Impossible.
[274:06.25]I wouldn't come close to reaching the dresser where the shutter key is.
[274:08.79]Shoot bucket.
[274:12.52]Wow.
[274:13.48]Did you see how far it flew?
[274:15.86]Further away.
[274:16.44]Huh?
[274:18.24]What is that?
[274:21.88]Fire extinguisher.
[274:23.90]If only I could.
[274:25.40]But I can't get the fire extinguisher from here.
[274:28.69]Shoot fire extinguisher.
[274:30.43]The fire extinguisher?
[274:32.71]Shoot extinguisher.
[274:34.29]I'll try it.
[274:34.83]I did it.
[274:42.72]Got it.
[274:53.67]That wasn't pleasant.
[274:59.67]But the fire's gone out.
[275:03.41]This will let us open that shutter.
[275:04.69]I got the shutter key.
[275:07.39]I probably should heal.
[275:08.65]OK.
[275:09.43]Let's go.
[275:09.85]Here we go.
[275:12.35]We got a bed.
[275:13.67]Emergency panel.
[275:14.61]The emergency panel.
[275:15.37]Run.
[275:15.69]Yes.
[275:18.98]I'll check it, just in case.
[275:28.07]These never have anything in them.
[275:33.77]Okay, we got a save point.
[275:36.21]Save point.
[275:37.01]I wonder how much more of the game there is.
[275:57.69]I'm going to say, like, another hour.
[276:04.14]I bet you we're getting close.
[276:07.00]Get up.
[276:07.84]Okay, I got it already.
[276:12.94]Okay.
[276:13.24]Dresser.
[276:14.18]The dresser.
[276:15.22]Okay.
[276:20.59]I think we're done with checking this place.
[276:22.65]It's already been smashed.
[276:23.55]I don't care anymore.
[276:29.09]Hallway.
[276:30.17]Okay, I'll leave.
[276:31.93]Run.
[276:32.61]Yes.
[276:47.38]It has to be Naomi.
[276:49.06]Naomi?
[276:50.73]Hello, is this Naomi?
[276:56.45]What if I'm Naomi?
[276:57.65]What a twist.
[276:58.31]Naomi!
[276:59.21]It's no good.
[276:59.71]She's not picking us up.
[277:01.13]My name is Naomi.
[277:04.35]I knew it.
[277:05.15]It's Naomi.
[277:06.73]If you see my boyfriend, please let him know.
[277:12.67]I'm fine.
[277:13.35]I'm not to worry.
[277:15.66]You can hear me.
[277:17.10]Find safety.
[277:24.52]You can hang up now.
[277:25.78]She's not there.
[277:29.78]Operator, you heard that, right?
[277:31.72]Mm-hmm.
[277:32.56]This is fantastic.
[277:34.03]Naomi's safe.
[277:35.27]Hurry, let's find her.
[277:40.67]So we got shutter is six.
[277:43.03]Shutter six.
[277:44.49]Shutter six.
[277:45.61]Okay.

[277:48.64]Run.

[278:38.99]What?

[278:47.02]Dodge left.
[278:51.96]Body.
[278:52.62]Tail.
[278:53.04]Tail.
[278:54.28]Tail.
[278:55.38]Tail.
[278:57.45]Usually it dies after you get the red eye.
[279:02.31]Yeah, the screen doesn't fit.
[279:03.57]You're right.
[279:04.35]We're gonna have to have those bars.
[279:13.03]So that's why it has to look like this.
[279:18.00]Oh well.
[279:20.28]Shutter 6.
[279:21.88]Wait!
[279:22.38]Don't do that yet.
[279:24.46]Heal Capsule.
[279:31.72]Shutter six.
[279:32.65]Shutter six.
[279:33.45]Run.
[279:33.79]OK.
[279:34.03]Yes.
[279:46.07]Use auto fire.
[279:46.71]If I just say auto fire, does that work?
[279:48.29]This will open that shutter.
[279:53.48]Hurry up and analyze.
[279:59.16]Sun suite.
[279:59.66]Oh, it's the moon suite.
[280:03.33]Monster.
[280:11.78]New NPC.
[280:13.92]Take your guess.
[280:22.43]Who's the evil... evil mastermind behind the whole thing, I wonder?
[280:29.33]Probably the doctor.
[280:30.07]That's the easiest answer.
[280:34.07]Is there anyone here?
[280:38.73]I'll check in the back.
[280:40.93]If you see anything, tell me.
[280:42.37]Okay.
[280:43.35]Don't screw up.
[280:47.03]Behind you!
[280:47.93]Behind?
[280:49.55]Watch out!
[280:52.27]I am being careful.
[280:55.96]I heard something.
[280:56.92]Huh?
[280:57.94]What?
[280:58.40]To your left.
[280:59.96]There doesn't appear to be anyone.
[281:02.12]I must have been imagining things.
[281:04.03]Sorry.
[281:05.11]Guess I didn't need you that time.
[281:06.17]You got him?
[281:08.60]Does he come?
[281:17.30]Shoot him.
[281:18.04]Shoot him!
[281:20.46]I'm so sorry about that.
[281:21.64]Now, both of you, please, compose yourselves.
[281:28.06]Apparently, some of the aliens are humanoid in appearance.
[281:31.36]I'm fine, apparently.
[281:33.65]I lost a good man to one.
[281:36.31]Oh, sorry to hear that.
[281:41.06]What is the situation?
[281:42.16]Do you know anything?
[281:46.18]I'm not sure what's happening either, but I've been told that a rescue team will be arriving in the receiving port.
[281:52.66]Excellent rescue team.
[281:54.22]Is that a car muffler?
[281:55.18]A rescue team.
[281:56.51]Oh, dear, that's wonderful.
[281:58.27]It's good.
[281:59.37]It's good news, yes.
[282:00.59]Where'd they get a car muffler?
[282:04.79]But, sir, which unit could it be?
[282:06.85]None of you have a gun?
[282:08.59]Perhaps army special forces?
[282:12.18]If so, that makes this a military incident.
[282:14.68]There was talk that the police department had a task force capable of this type of rescue and extraction.
[282:19.86]If that's the case, and it is the police, we should be able to cover up some of the legal issues that will stem from this incident.
[282:26.40]Still, it's a problem I wasn't informed.
[282:28.24]Oh, yes, sir, of course.
[282:29.92]What is the point of discussing politics at this very moment?
[282:33.92]What's going on with this guy's hands?
[282:38.00]He's got Mr. Free's hands.
[282:39.50]Why?
[282:39.62]Fuck every single one of you.
[282:57.03]You're determined to make life difficult.
[282:59.53]Piece of cake.
[283:00.45]You're all losers.
[283:01.23]It's the same as the shutters in the hallway.
[283:03.13]All of you.
[283:03.49]He says he can.
[283:05.11]Oh.
[283:06.15]Oh.
[283:07.70]She muted me.
[283:08.42]He's like, I know, he can do it.
[283:11.96]Good, but we aren't the only ones in need of rescuing.
[283:15.84]Get word to the team leader that I won't board the shuttle.
[283:21.01]Yes, sir.
[283:21.95]Understood.
[283:22.87]Fine.
[283:23.39]Let's be on our way.
[283:29.59]What about my future?
[283:31.67]I'm locked in a surveillance room without food or water.
[283:36.27]At least you can drink little heel juices.
[283:39.83]I don't have any of that.
[284:05.57]The door panel appears to have been broken.
[284:08.63]We can't get into the moon suite anymore.
[284:10.67]Okay.
[284:13.93]The Prime Minister's party is headed for the receiving port.
[284:17.13]We need to hurry.
[284:18.49]Elevator hall.
[284:19.87]The elevator hall.
[284:20.99]Okay.
[284:22.33]Run.
[284:23.69]Run.
[284:24.21]Yes.
[284:28.11]The operator hasn't gone to the bathroom in over four hours?
[284:30.17]Yeah, I have.
[284:31.55]The enemy has been spotted.
[284:38.29]Back! Back!
[284:38.53]Dodge right! Dodge right! Dodge right!
[284:42.81]Flee!
[284:47.88]Head.
[284:49.05]Mouth.

[286:16.18]Run.

[288:41.62]Where is this?
[288:43.54]Get up.
[288:44.36]All the way.
[288:56.54]You have to be patient.
[288:57.86]It's hard to be patient when there's enemies shooting spit in your face.
[289:02.63]And you have to dodge, dodge left.
[289:05.49]I guess I will.
[289:07.07]But not, I'm not gonna do it again when you tell me to do it again.
[289:10.95]Why would I do that?
[289:12.25]Hello, is this Naomi?
[289:14.47]Give me a break.
[289:16.79]Naomi!
[289:20.71]It's no good, she's not picking us up.
[289:22.27]Naomi?
[289:24.84]It's Naomi.
[289:25.92]I knew it.
[289:27.14]It's Naomi.
[289:28.28]If you see my boyfriend...
[289:31.20]Please let him know.
[289:34.02]Right, right, right, right, right.
[289:35.86]Fire.
[289:36.20]You can hear me.
[289:39.92]Why can't you just shoot the enemy?
[289:45.89]I need someone to tell me when to shoot.
[289:48.57]You're the one holding the gun.
[289:50.43]Just do it.
[289:52.11]You heard that, right?
[289:52.97]This is fantastic.
[289:55.59]Naomi's safe.
[289:56.83]Hurry, let's find her.
[290:00.66]Thank you, Broluck, for the $100... $102, actually.

[290:08.10]And you say, you're so bad at this game, mate.
[290:19.23]I... I don't even know if that's physically possible.
[290:26.77]To be bad at a game from 2004 with voice activation.
[290:31.23]I don't think it's possible.
[290:32.93]100 bucks of tr- it's just a talk- you talk- talking.
[290:42.68]I'm talking to you.
[290:45.38]What is it?
[290:46.96]Do you see how many times I said the same thing like a thousand times?
[290:51.18]And she looks at me like a fucking dog.
[290:53.98]Like tilting her head sideways.
[290:56.96]Like, huh?
[290:58.64]I don't know what that word is.

[294:30.66]I don't even need to defend myself.
[294:33.10]Why would I even defend myself against this?
[294:35.28]What would I do that for?
[294:36.16]There's no reason for me to defend this.
[294:41.11]Save point.

[295:05.94]What's that term called?
[295:06.64]Let me see.
[295:11.85]Let me tell her.
[295:13.29]It's called give me a break.
[295:15.27]It's three deaths in five hours.

[295:22.05]No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[295:40.38]But anyways, thank you, Broluck, for the 300.
[295:44.47]I want everyone to understand this here.
[295:49.32]Three hundred and three dollars.
[295:53.54]Three hundred bucks.
[295:55.02]Three hundred dollars.
[295:59.76]Can you just admit it, please, so I can stop donating?
[296:04.75]Why are you doing this?
[296:11.43]Get up.
[296:12.35]Okay, I got it already.
[296:17.76]Hallway.
[296:18.30]I'm not gonna... Why would I admit that I'm bad at... It's a game where you tell somebody... Oh, you're not getting an admission from me?
[296:27.26]Recover.
[296:33.01]Hallway.
[296:33.81]I'm not gonna say it.
[296:37.05]Hallway!
[296:37.33]Ugh.
[296:46.46]Bro, like, thanks for the $303.
[296:49.06]Examine coat.
[296:49.38]That is a coat.
[296:49.84]Examine bathrobe.
[296:51.70]Yes.
[296:51.78]Get the grab item on bathrobe.
[297:16.38]Shooting something like this won't accomplish a thing.
[297:20.71]But you know, it's definitely your bad.
[297:25.73]Okay.
[297:27.85]Examine item on bathrobe.
[297:31.43]The bathrobe?
[297:33.23]I don't need that.
[297:37.03]Card on bathrobe.
[297:40.90]It's the hotel's.
[297:43.18]They only loan it out to guests who ask for it.
[297:48.77]Examine bathrobe pocket.
[297:52.15]The bathrobe?
[297:53.95]I don't need that.
[297:56.23]Look in pocket.
[297:57.77]Huh?
[297:58.66]Of what?
[297:59.76]Of the... Of the... Of the... You must be bad at the game!
[298:06.26]You must be bad at the game!
[298:08.32]In this bed?
[298:10.33]Nobody would be able to sleep in it.
[298:13.33]That's enough...
[298:19.57]Alright, Broluck, you... This is ridiculous.
[298:24.75]Thank you for the $400.
[298:25.23]You don't have to do any more.
[298:28.89]You don't have to do any more.
[298:30.55]That's way more money than you should ever... In one minute here, Broluck, that's a lot of fucking money.
[298:39.91]And they say, I swear to fucking God, this is becoming reckless.
[298:42.31]Please, admit it.
[298:43.60]I just proved on camera, on stream, that I don't have to.
[298:47.79]You just saw in real time.
[298:50.86]I don't have to.
[298:52.76]But for the sake of you not doing that again, I know.
[298:58.68]Why would I do that?
[299:02.10]Look in bathrobe pocket.
[299:05.54]It's the hotel.
[299:07.01]There's nothing strange about it.
[299:16.27]Check pocket.
[299:18.17]Huh?
[299:19.05]Of what?
[299:21.51]Check bathrobe pocket.
[299:23.75]It's the hotel's.
[299:25.21]There's nothing strange about it.
[299:28.74]Grab keycard in pocket.
[299:31.34]Are you talking about this?
[299:34.32]What?
[299:36.96]Grab card.
[299:38.40]Are you talking about this?
[299:51.04]But, honest to God, Broluck, uh... I am not bad at this game.
[299:58.48]It's, uh, I'm playing through it, and it's fun.
[300:02.28]And pocket in the bathrobe.
[300:04.00]Grab which pocket in bathrobe?
[300:05.64]What bathrobe?
[300:06.32]This one.
[300:08.97]That could be the 400 fucking dollars.
[300:11.01]Grab the key in the bathrobe.
[300:11.89]That's un-fucking-believable.
[300:12.99]Okay.
[300:29.15]Alright, can I like ban Broluck from giving money?
[300:38.35]That's $500, dude.
[300:41.84]$500.
[300:41.86]That's $500.
[300:47.12]Alright, I gotta save.
[300:48.36]I gotta save your bank account.
[300:50.64]You can't do that again.
[300:51.40]I'm bad at the game.
[300:51.99]There you go.
[300:52.51]You're done.
[300:55.86]I'm not good at the game.
[300:56.80]I'm very bad at speaking.
[300:58.56]I'm very bad at having somebody interpret the things that I'm saying when I clearly say them at least 15 times in a row, and I just say the same thing again, uh, in a different way, and she takes it out of the pocket.
[301:11.46]So I'm sorry I'm bad at that.
[301:17.54]Thanks for the 500 fucking dollars.
[301:27.48]Save point.
[301:35.61]Carlos the Clam gave $24.
[301:36.59]This game can be beaten in under three hours, Jerma.
[301:39.50]I can look it up.
[301:42.38]I'm sure it could, but you've got to be good, right?
[301:57.67]Here comes the confessions.
[301:59.59]Here comes the clips of me saying it.
[302:01.87]Get up.
[302:06.85]Hallway.
[302:09.41]Why do I even need to... Hallway.
[302:11.97]I don't even need to have this conversation.
[302:15.59]It's... It's remarkable that this thing can even hear me talk in the first place.
[302:21.94]This is... This is...
[302:25.69]It's 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[302:26.93]This is 15 fucking years.
[302:28.91]What are you doing?
[302:37.96]Where should I go?
[302:38.58]Thanks, mate.
[302:42.44]Now I don't have to donate anymore to prove my point.
[302:44.34]I'm glad because I've only got $100 left.
[302:48.70]Alright, that's six.
[302:52.26]Shutter's six.
[302:53.74]Shutter six, okay?
[302:57.82]I can't fucking believe you just gave $600.
[303:03.65]You gave fucking that much money.
[303:06.77]You are mad.
[303:08.13]You are mad.
[303:15.05]No.
[303:15.89]No.
[303:16.45]Run!
[303:17.08]Yes.
[303:22.91]No, no, no.
[303:25.93]Stubborn streamer scams innocent fan out of life savings.
[303:28.93]That didn't happen.
[303:43.88]Thank you, Brawluck, for the unbelievable amount of money to tell me that I'm bad at this game.
[303:50.66]For me to say that I'm bad at the game.
[303:58.08]I wonder if someone's there.
[304:01.02]I'll check.
[304:02.94]Today we learned bribing Jerma to say something works, but it's because he's afraid of getting more money from you and feels bad.
[304:08.30]Alright, this time we're gonna get it.
[304:14.58]Is there anyone here?
[304:18.89]I'll check in the back.
[304:21.11]If you see anything, tell me.
[304:23.37]That was an unbelievable last, like, 25 minutes.
[304:26.69]That last, like, 20 minutes...
[304:31.19]This is wild.
[304:35.33]There doesn't appear to be anyone.
[304:37.50]I must have been imagining things.
[304:39.44]Sorry.
[304:40.52]Guess I didn't need you that time.
[304:41.42]To the right.
[304:42.58]Right.
[304:42.84]Right.
[304:43.66]Right.
[304:47.16]Hey, what's going on?
[304:48.58]Is it okay to shoot me?
[304:53.02]Are you human?
[304:53.90]But I'm bad at the game.
[304:55.34]I'm so bad.
[304:55.90]I'm so terrible at this game.
[304:58.34]Hold up.
[305:00.62]I'm so sorry about that.
[305:03.28]Mad because bad.
[305:04.32]Bad because bad.
[305:05.30]Mad because bad.
[305:08.24]Apparently some of the aliens are humanoid in appearance.
[305:13.85]I lost a good man to one.
[305:15.85]Oh.
[305:17.77]Sorry to hear that.
[305:19.29]You work here, don't you?
[305:20.75]What is the situation in the hotel?
[305:22.83]Do you know anything?
[305:26.35]I'm not sure what's happening either.
[305:28.15]But I've been told that a rescue team will be arriving in the receiving point.
[305:32.77]Alright, you're banned.
[305:34.19]Somebody ban him.
[305:35.29]A rescue team?
[305:36.66]Oh dear, that's wonderful.
[305:39.52]It's good news, yes.
[305:41.62]How do I stop somebody from giving money to a Twitch server?
[305:46.00]Which unit could it be?
[305:47.06]Perhaps Army Special Forces?
[305:52.34]If so, that makes this a military incident.
[305:54.84]There was talk that the police department had a task force capable of this type of rescue and extraction.
[306:00.03]If that's the case, the police should be able to come up with a legal issue that will stem from this incident.
[306:06.53]Still, it's a problem I wasn't informed.
[306:09.23]Yes, sir.
[306:10.05]Avoid a question that's affecting politics at this very moment.
[306:15.78]Yes, sir.
[306:16.44]By the way, there's a big problem.
[306:19.64]The receiving post shutter is locked and...
[306:22.02]And it won't open.
[306:24.00]What's that?
[306:25.33]It shouldn't be a problem.
[306:27.25]I have an operator backing me up.
[306:29.35]He'll open it for us.
[306:30.31]700 fucking bucks.
[306:31.93]You can do it, right?
[306:34.03]I'm looking over it.
[306:36.01]Yes, I'll do it.
[306:36.83]I'll save us all.
[306:38.01]There's no need to be formal with me.
[306:40.80]He says he can.
[306:43.64]What the fuck is going on?
[306:45.36]What are you guys doing?
[306:49.25]Good, but we aren't the only ones in need of rescuing.
[306:53.13]Get word to the team leader that... Tora T just gave 50.
[306:55.62]Yes, sir.
[306:59.24]Understood.
[307:00.16]Fine, let's be on our way.
[307:01.47]That's 50 community subs.
[307:06.87]I never expected to be attacked by Prime Minister Takeyama's bodyguard.
[307:11.30]We both better be prepared for more surprises.
[307:13.30]A lot of community subs.
[307:14.86]From one person, $700.
[307:15.52]And then $200.
[307:15.88]$500.
[307:15.90]What?
[307:16.04]How much?
[307:16.98]That's... Oh, no.
[307:17.78]Most... Mostly lost $50.
[307:18.40]No, this is...
[307:39.03]It's too much money for one stream.
[307:41.23]Alright, we can do the stream money cooldown now.
[307:43.99]Mostly Lost says... No, I don't... I can't do that.
[308:08.31]Alright, we're on stream money cooldown now.
[308:15.41]Local man donates $700 to his favorite streamer to prove his love, only to get banned when the streamer finds out he has no money left to give.
[308:25.69]You're awfully slow with instructions.
[308:35.01]That's so evil, but it's not the case.
[308:37.99]No, he's not banned.
[308:39.51]Alright, where do I need me to go?
[308:40.94]Thank you for the fucking, like, 1,500 bucks.
[308:51.78]How did we just gain, like, 1,500 viewers?
[308:56.51]What just happened?
[309:05.38]Did Joel just come in with a raid?
[309:08.24]Oh my god, 20 subs.
[309:11.20]There's too much going on.
[309:12.54]So, should I just go off on my own?
[309:15.20]Yes, go off on your own.
[309:17.74]How am I supposed to understand that?
[309:20.50]Okay, first of all, hold on.
[309:22.28]My brain is in five different places.
[309:26.18]Joel just came in.
[309:29.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[309:31.09]Okay, first of all, Exhibit A.
[309:35.13]Joel just came in with a raid.
[309:37.74]Raid.
[309:38.80]A bunch of people.
[309:39.42]Thanks, Joel.
[309:40.58]Hope you had a good stream.
[309:41.54]Welcome, everybody, from Joel's channel.
[309:43.20]Go check out Joel.
[309:44.02]He's fucking awesome.
[309:45.06]Streams are awesome.
[309:46.24]He's a really funny, really awesome guy.
[309:48.12]Welcome, guys.
[309:49.10]Second of all, $50 came in from... Most of the loss gave $80.
[309:58.47]I had a great, great Canadian fuck, just gave a hundred community subs from great community, uh, Canadian fuck club.
[310:05.16]And then we had 20 for, okay, I gotta, I gotta get out of here, I gotta leave.

[313:12.27]What am I gonna do with this money?
[313:16.55]I'm gonna have to... Well... I don't know what to say.

[316:23.61]Sash, somebody said, buy a Vive.
[316:25.01]It's really funny that you say that, because I was actually looking at... Because the new Vive got just announced.
[316:29.48]Like, the Cosmos, right?
[316:30.10]Oh, I can't get into the Moonsuite anymore.
[316:33.84]I can't save it anymore.
[316:34.54]Elevator Hall.
[316:34.88]Okay.

[316:45.26]Just do me a quick little favor here, everybody that's in chat.
[316:49.16]Just look at the top bits right now.
[316:54.20]Look at how ridiculous that is.
[317:00.87]That is absolutely fucking insane.
[317:15.60]Where should I go?
[317:16.24]Wow.
[317:19.82]Receiving port.
[317:20.84]The receiving port.
[317:21.64]OK.
[317:21.96]Someone gave 100,000 bits at one time.
[317:37.67]I don't even know what to say.
[317:39.81]Thank you, guys.
[317:40.67]Everyone that came from Joel's channel... Sorry you kind of jumped in the middle of that.
[317:45.69]But it was wild.
[317:46.09]Come on.
[317:46.49]Stand on left.
[317:46.89]Yeah.
[317:47.05]Put...
[318:08.74]Put face in keycard.
[318:10.00]No, okay.
[318:11.08]For controlling the power supply to a gate... We need the shutter open, quick.
[318:18.38]Power it on.
[318:19.18]Okay.
[318:26.46]Uh, three, two, one... Here comes at least three or four deaths.
[318:33.51]Okay, let's open the main gate.
[318:40.66]There's gonna be water.
[318:41.36]There's gonna be like a huge rushing water.
[318:44.04]The muffler guy still has the muffler.
[318:53.29]That's great.
[319:03.87]Dear?
[319:04.81]Hey, there's no one here!
[319:07.24]They think we're gonna get surrounded.
[319:08.46]Where is the rescue team?
[319:10.16]Perhaps they haven't arrived yet, sir.
[319:13.22]This isn't a good place to be.
[319:15.22]If we were attacked by aliens in the open... I was wearing gloves.
[319:22.93]Okay, I get it.
[319:23.47]I told you.
[319:24.13]At least three people are dead here.
[319:25.41]What?
[319:25.61]It's no good.
[319:26.35]Turn around.
[319:30.49]We're surrounded.
[319:33.38]Who told you about the rescue team?
[319:35.02]It was the supervisor, Mr. Powers.
[319:37.01]I knew something was wrong.
[319:38.33]But I... Wait, the muffler guy first?
[319:40.71]I'll draw their attention.
[319:42.13]When I do that, run!
[319:44.51]Sir, I can't let you do that.
[319:51.16]Listen, how many can you take?
[319:52.92]Maybe two or three max?
[319:54.88]No, you can't.
[319:55.50]You can barely take one.
[319:56.86]I figured.
[319:57.88]In that case, more for me.
[320:01.15]Are we about to get shown up here?
[320:03.17]Four missed shots.
[320:04.41]Well, you're just as bad as I am.
[320:05.89]Everybody's terrible in this game, apparently.
[320:07.63]You can't hit anything.
[320:10.86]Acid.
[320:15.20]This is one.
[320:18.62]Ah, the military's here, of course.
[320:28.78]How many people could fit in a vent up there?
[320:30.92]There's like 60 people in the vent.
[320:32.42]Did they all aim down and just start firing at the same time?
[320:44.93]Fall in!
[320:48.49]Move it!
[320:49.65]Over here!
[320:50.23]Hey!
[320:54.81]Do I get rescued too?
[320:56.53]Barricade the perimeter so nothing can break in.
[320:59.09]Yes, sir.
[321:03.88]I'm sorry about your friend.
[321:05.66]I could make a Rainbow Six Siege reference here, but why would I do that?
[321:09.18]I don't even play.
[321:10.62]Captain Yatsumeta, sir.
[321:13.17]The shuttle terminal has been destroyed, so we had to break through the ceiling.
[321:18.57]That delayed our arrival.
[321:22.03]Oh.
[321:22.63]We received a transmission from Mr. Powers describing what has taken place.
[321:26.91]We'll be setting up our base of operations here at the receiving port.
[321:30.29]We will take all survivors into protective custody here.
[321:32.87]Sorry we killed that guy.
[321:33.61]Barricades will be erected to keep the aliens out.
[321:36.13]Do not leave the area for any reason.
[321:38.71]Is that understood?
[321:40.09]Understood.
[321:41.43]Captain.
[321:44.29]The suit?
[321:45.34]Do I get to wear that?
[321:46.08]May I borrow this?
[321:48.44]That's an armored suit for combat use.
[321:52.07]What?
[321:52.19]What the fuck?
[321:52.81]She was so against changing clothes two hours ago.
[321:57.10]All of a sudden she wants to wear the Earthworm Jim costume.
[322:19.41]I mean, to be honest though, if there was an Earthworm Jim costume available, I would put it on too.
[322:35.99]Alright.
[322:37.01]No, we're still going.
[322:38.81]What's next?
[322:39.21]In the center of the...
[322:50.07]In the meantime, let's go find Helen Johnson, the reporter.
[322:53.35]I can't do this without your help.
[322:56.37]Will you just trust me?
[322:57.84]Just a little while longer?
[323:02.38]No.
[323:03.14]Hey, we're not through here.
[323:06.42]You're still helping me, right?
[323:08.64]I haven't had water in seven hours.
[323:11.23]And I haven't had food in seven hours.
[323:13.11]Will you just trust me?
[323:14.59]Just a little while longer?
[323:15.59]I'm dying up here!
[323:16.93]Will you just trust me?
[323:18.39]Just a little while longer?
[323:22.73]Okay.
[323:25.23]Leaving the gun?
[323:27.27]Uh, $200 just came in.
[323:27.89]From Kara Tobey.
[323:51.57]Okay, let's get out of here.
[323:54.70]200 bucks.
[323:56.04]And they say, gotta round out for Brola.
[323:58.78]Hey, where do you think you're going?
[324:00.14]I just need to go get something.
[324:01.02]For a thousand.
[324:02.24]You're not going anywhere.
[324:03.78]Nobody is going anywhere, period.
[324:05.12]Holy shit, guys.
[324:05.98]Our guns!
[324:08.38]Our guns are useless!
[324:09.70]We're under attack by some invincible alien!
[324:12.84]Does it look like a giant spider?
[324:14.83]Use a flamethrower.
[324:22.23]We're never gonna get to see the Flamescrawler.
[324:26.85]But thanks a lot guys, seriously.
[324:28.25]Kara, Toby, Broluck, Vladimir, like there's people that gave more than like the five fucking hundred subs I think that came in.
[324:36.62]Community subs.
[324:37.16]You guys are fucking unbelievable.
[324:41.69]My god.
[324:53.98]Got away safely.
[324:56.12]Thanks to that wireless system.
[325:00.24]Just you and me.
[325:00.78]There's supposed to be a monster that even the rescue team couldn't handle.
[325:05.96]We have to find Helen and Naomi as soon as we can.
[325:09.15]It's not safe.
[325:10.29]I'm going for it.
[325:10.91]I'll go for it.
[325:12.73]If we were to check every room one by one, we'd surely find them.
[325:19.21]Past here's the staff area.

[325:45.63]The control staff quarters, OK?
[325:57.79]Undo the door lock, please.

[330:39.15]Wait a minute, hold on.
[330:41.45]This is the last time I was even allowed to save the game.
[330:46.33]This was an hour ago.
[330:48.75]That's the last time I was allowed to save the game?
[330:53.88]Well, if I didn't miss 400 rounds, point blank, out of, like, 420.
[331:03.90]Up.
[331:09.54]I couldn't, I can't go back in this room.
[331:11.08]This is the last room I was allowed to go in.
[331:14.06]Hallway.
[331:15.73]Because this, the electricity happens and it's like, oh, I can't do that anymore.
[331:20.29]Hallway.
[331:23.13]Hallway.
[331:28.27]I can't believe with a machine gun you missed almost 500 fucking times point blank.

[331:51.41]What?
[331:52.99]Shutter six?
[331:53.71]This is how far back that is?
[331:55.11]Run.
[332:17.00]I don't think there was even a save point in the middle.
[332:18.84]It was like the hallway stuff, the bunch of cutscenes, cutscene again, military comes in, and then that.
[332:25.17]Was there even, I don't think there was even a save point.
[332:27.79]Maybe in that road that I walked into.
[332:32.23]We finally made it to here.
[332:35.77]The receiving port is just ahead.
[332:46.60]Yeah, because I can't leave.
[332:48.15]This happens, and then when I come out, I can't go anywhere, right?
[333:04.19]Is there anyone here?
[333:05.03]Well, this is terrible.
[333:08.85]I'll check in the back.
[333:11.05]If you see anything, tell me.
[333:13.50]Don't screw up.
[333:25.30]There doesn't appear to be anyone.
[333:27.46]I must have been imagining things.
[333:29.39]Sorry.
[333:30.47]Guess I didn't need you that time.
[333:31.71]Look out!
[333:33.51]What?
[333:37.15]Hey, what's going on?
[333:38.55]Is it okay to shoot?
[333:40.93]Hey!
[333:42.40]Hey, listen up!
[333:45.32]She did it on her own.
[333:48.00]Are you human?
[333:49.04]What part of me looks alien to you?
[333:50.80]And I can't skip.
[333:51.94]Hold up.
[333:55.67]God damn it.
[333:59.29]There's so much in between this shit.
[334:00.97]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[334:02.38]We're so close to the end.
[334:21.31]I'm not sure what's happening either, but I've been told that a rescue team will be arriving in the receiving port.
[334:26.54]We have to be getting close.
[334:27.76]Excellent.
[334:28.78]Rescue team.
[334:30.26]A rescue team.
[334:31.62]Oh, dear, that's wonderful.
[334:33.36]It's good.
[334:34.46]It's good news, yes.
[334:36.29]Oh, that's wonderful.
[334:37.47]About time.
[334:39.93]But, sir, which unit could it be?
[334:43.47]Let's see how far this one...
[334:47.21]Discussing politics?
[335:12.88]There's a big problem.
[335:14.60]The receiving port shutter is locked and it won't open.
[335:18.96]What's that?
[335:20.28]It shouldn't be a problem.
[335:22.20]I have an operator backing me up.
[335:23.48]He'll open it for us.
[335:26.88]You can do it, right?
[335:29.70]Yes.
[335:30.30]I knew you could do it.
[335:31.28]Yes, I can.
[335:31.84]Go.
[335:32.22]Hurry.
[335:32.40]Good news.
[335:41.02]He's still here, Gavin.
[335:41.78]Okay.
[336:17.57]For a luck got baited into dropping 800.
[336:19.05]See, remember the door closes behind me, and I can't go in here.
[336:34.62]Why would you, hold on.
[336:36.98]It's the only save point back here.
[336:38.76]Why wouldn't you let somebody save the game after like a long ass cut scene like that?
[336:43.57]Can I go through the shutter?
[336:45.67]Like, can I... Shutter six.
[336:50.53]Can I go through it?
[336:53.37]Run.
[336:53.97]Yes.
[336:59.03]What should I do now?
[337:02.63]Guest room five.
[337:04.76]It's so far away.
[337:08.78]Run.
[337:09.28]Yes.
[337:23.91]Undo the door lock, please.
[337:30.43]Thanks.

[339:21.21]Yes.
[339:33.57]Please die quickly.
[339:34.85]I'm bored of this.
[339:37.49]Well, the reason why you're bored of it is because we had to go back and do it all over again.
[339:44.42]I'd be bored of it too.
[339:47.92]Back.

[341:19.54]You gotta be kidding me.
[341:24.14]Recover.
[341:24.90]Yes.
[341:29.00]Phew.
[341:33.57]Are we still doing... Alright, we gotta put it into...
[341:39.73]Put into emote only for five minutes.
[341:43.05]Are we still talking politics in here?
[341:45.33]Is he actually watching me?
[341:59.46]Don't.
[341:59.98]Just don't mention it.
[342:01.96]Well, every time I look over here, people are arguing with each other.
[342:05.28]I don't want that.
[342:11.04]Receiving port.

[343:56.68]The receiving port is up ahead.
[344:04.14]Receiving port.
[344:05.34]The receiving port, okay.
[344:14.36]Save, save.
[344:15.22]No, I don't even care.
[344:16.22]I gotta run all the way back to like room 5.
[344:18.34]I'm not gonna lose.
[344:19.51]We're gonna do it right now.
[344:21.03]Everyone, the guy dies.
[344:22.03]Hallway.
[344:47.13]Right panel.
[344:48.21]Panel?
[344:49.43]What panel do you mean?
[344:53.90]Okay, let's open the main gate.
[345:33.23]I'm just here enjoying the stream.
[345:35.81]Oh, that's good.
[345:37.87]Dear?
[345:38.83]Hey, there's no one here.
[345:42.37]Where is the rescue team?
[345:44.17]Perhaps they haven't arrived yet, sir.
[345:47.23]This isn't a good place to be.
[345:49.25]If we were attacked by aliens in the open... What?
[345:58.14]It's no good.
[345:59.82]Turn around.
[346:01.67]We're surrounded.
[346:07.55]Who told you about the rescue team?
[346:09.19]It was the supervisor, Mr. Powers.
[346:11.17]I knew something was wrong.
[346:14.65]Oh, what?
[346:16.81]I pressed select before.
[346:20.94]Listen to this.
[346:22.60]Naomi is definitely not here.
[346:25.30]She must be waiting for help somewhere.
[346:26.76]I pressed every button like three times.
[346:28.02]Look, the rescue team will be here soon enough.
[346:29.86]Quick, come on, let me talk.
[346:31.58]In the meantime, let's go find Helen Johnson, the reporter.
[346:34.84]I can't do this without your help.
[346:37.85]Will you just trust me?
[346:39.33]Just a little while longer?
[346:46.29]Will you just trust me?
[346:47.77]Just a little while longer?
[346:50.35]Come on.
[346:52.09]Come on, just do it.
[346:54.51]No.
[346:56.71]Yes.
[346:59.41]I want to sneeze into the microphone so bad, but I haven't been able to do it ever.
[347:03.31]I get sneeze shy when it happens.
[347:05.38]It's really irritating.
[347:11.72]I know this will work.
[347:13.86]And I managed to get one of these.
[347:15.32]Yeah, and you're a terrible shot.
[347:18.36]The PM's group should be safe now, especially with weapons like these to protect them.
[347:25.21]Okay, let's get out of here.
[347:32.10]I can't believe Select does it, and I really thought I pressed it a dozen times.
[347:48.01]Phew.
[347:49.25]Okay.
[347:49.85]Gotta wait safely.
[347:52.03]Thanks to that wireless system.
[347:56.66]There's supposed to be a monster that even the rescue team couldn't handle.
[348:01.84]We have to find Helen and Naomi as soon as we can.
[348:03.83]Can I go back in receiving port?
[348:05.03]It's not safe.
[348:08.61]If we were to check every room one by one, we'd surely find them.
[348:12.17]Oh, God.
[348:15.09]Past here is the staff area.
[348:17.58]Where shall we check first?
[348:19.96]Receiving port.
[348:21.76]Right?
[348:25.46]Receiving port.
[348:26.66]The receiving port.
[348:27.84]Okay.
[348:29.10]Just go back in and see if there's a kiosk.
[348:31.04]Aren't we going to look for Naomi?
[348:32.50]No.
[348:32.90]Okay.
[348:33.34]So then... Let's move on.
[348:35.97]Service staff quarters.
[348:37.49]The service staff quarters.
[348:38.93]Run.
[348:39.07]Okay.
[348:39.51]Yes.
[348:39.85]Huh?
[349:00.32]Listen, do you hear shooting?
[349:02.64]Shooting?
[349:07.32]I think it's from the warehouse.
[349:08.90]We should check it out.
[349:15.83]It's a dead end this way.
[349:20.87]Why is that showing up on stream right now?
[349:26.13]That's from an hour and a half ago.
[349:29.86]That gun is so big.
[349:30.48]That's a cosplay gun.
[349:48.55]A major wobble was detected in the Faith Station's rotation.
[349:53.49]The station was placed on emergency status, although the wobble will not interfere with its orbit.
[350:00.40]Phew.
[350:05.44]It sounds like a war zone.
[350:08.47]I think there was a warehouse key in my room.
[350:11.17]Let's go get it.
[350:12.71]It's in the service staff quarters.
[350:19.51]So I have to go in there.
[350:22.27]Service staff quarters.
[350:23.75]The service staff quarters.
[350:25.27]Okay.
[350:25.87]Run.
[350:26.41]Yes.
[350:37.98]Back.
[350:42.06]Right eye.

[350:48.15]Red eye.
[350:51.08]Did you see that?
[350:59.61]Service staff quarters.
[351:00.86]The service staff quarters.
[351:02.12]Run.
[351:02.38]Okay.
[351:03.18]Run.
[351:03.54]Yes.
[351:19.68]Big monster?
[351:20.04]My room?
[351:21.82]What do you mean, my room?
[351:37.53]Oh, this is fantastic.
[351:39.23]I just ran into, like, the last boss.
[351:41.07]Back.
[351:42.05]Back.
[351:43.21]Back.

[353:31.56]What's going on?
[353:32.18]Save point.
[353:32.82]What is happening right now?
[353:34.27]I didn't touch anything.
[353:34.97]I didn't say anything.
[353:36.15]Save point is right here.
[353:39.11]Get out of that machine and go downstairs and save.
[353:42.97]This can't be.
[353:46.13]I know this person.
[353:46.83]Oh.
[353:49.13]All my clothes.
[353:55.37]My pictures.
[353:57.23]Where are all my pictures?
[354:02.72]This is... This is awful.
[354:07.24]I just... I give up.
[354:09.56]You're not going to have to react.
[354:15.54]Oh, I have to convince her to keep going.
[354:20.44]Root body, root body, left eye, root body, leaf.
[354:32.85]We can do this.
[354:34.99]We can do it.
[354:35.99]There are so many mementos.
[354:41.54]We can root body, leaf body, root body.
[354:44.04]We can do it.
[354:45.06]I shouldn't have brought them all.
[354:50.30]If you're upset about the clothes, I've got clothes.
[354:55.27]And I'm willing to let you have some.
[354:57.89]Money.
[355:00.73]You want money.
[355:02.50]My clothes.
[355:03.36]You want money?
[355:04.34]You want... Well, I can give you some money.
[355:09.10]My photographs.
[355:11.42]We can get a new camera, too.
[355:13.81]You're right.
[355:14.97]I can't let myself get too depressed over things like this, but... Phew.
[355:21.25]You can have that $200.
[355:21.93]See?
[355:22.15]All it took was, hey, you can have some money, you can have some clothes...
[355:37.80]You want some money?
[355:39.40]No, that wouldn't be it.
[355:40.54]Do you want any money?
[355:42.08]No, that wouldn't be it.
[355:43.60]I think I've forgotten something important.
[355:45.80]What was it?
[355:46.72]Your clothes.
[355:48.09]No, I mean to my room.
[355:50.51]Why did I come here?
[355:52.41]I don't know.
[355:54.89]I think I came for something.
[355:56.39]You brought me up here.
[355:58.37]Listen, can you help me remember?
[356:01.13]What did I come to get?
[356:04.29]A photo.
[356:06.19]Listen, can you help me remember?
[356:08.95]What did I come to get?

[359:31.00]So what am I supposed to do here?
[359:36.78]Now I'm stuck.
[359:39.24]Without your support I don't have the confidence to go through.
[359:43.18]Maybe we need to find an alternate route.

[376:50.91]A hint, huh?
[376:52.25]Food.
[376:53.95]I'm not going to tell you anymore.
[376:58.05]I don't have the slightest idea.

[377:07.67]Fruit candy?
[377:10.53]This is a message for Jonathan Turner.

[377:24.72]Think about it.
[377:27.00]Fruit candy.

[377:31.02]Leave room.
[377:31.92]Leave.
[377:32.72]First floor.
[377:34.03]I'm not going to tell you anymore.

[377:41.13]There's candy all over the table.
[377:43.65]He has a huge invoice for a ton of candy.
[377:46.97]It's not candy.
[377:50.42]Is this your idea of password security?

[384:31.99]Is this French bread?
[384:33.41]Got it.
[384:34.17]It doesn't look very appetizing.
[384:35.39]Okay.
[384:44.36]What am I to eat?
[384:47.62]Eat cheese.
[384:49.20]I don't really like cheese very much.
[384:51.52]Eat donut.
[384:52.61]No way.
[384:53.39]This is so unhealthy.
[384:55.43]Its calorie content must be sky high.
[384:58.47]Eat bread.
[384:59.43]This looks like really crusty bread.
[385:02.09]It might even chip.
[385:02.87]What am I to eat?
[385:03.59]Eat ham.
[385:04.43]We don't have the time to be slicing ham.
[385:07.50]Drink coffee.
[385:08.94]I'm not thirsty.
[385:19.26]Well, then you don't get to eat.
[385:22.23]Because you've got plenty of options.
[385:24.71]Donuts, bread, ham, cheese, coffee.
[385:29.61]Leave.
[385:30.79]Huh?
[385:32.17]Do what with what?

[385:43.00]Okay.
[385:47.00]What is even on the top?
[385:48.66]This is like candies.
[385:50.28]Check candy.
[385:52.04]They're in different colors.
[385:54.26]They must be in different flavors, too.
[385:56.54]I'm sure they're very appetizing.
[385:59.12]Check middle of table.
[386:01.26]About the only thing eye-catching is that candy jar.
[386:03.86]Check candy jar.
[386:05.68]There are candies in many colors.
[386:09.66]Open jar of candy.

[386:55.48]It's got candy.
[387:08.62]This lady's gonna kill you when she finds you.
[387:11.92]Check table.
[387:14.84]Check table.
[387:27.83]Read jar of candy.
[387:30.37]That's it.

[388:12.61]Jonathan's room.
[388:13.80]Okay.
[388:15.84]I'd like to get into this room.
[388:23.40]This is a message for Jonathan Turner.
[388:27.37]Can you identify what I collect?
[388:30.55]Are you ready?
[388:31.87]Say your answer into the mic.
[388:34.19]He said he was collecting something you eat.
[388:37.57]Think about it.
[388:40.64]Fruit candy.
[388:42.16]Maybe it was a bit too tough.
[388:44.40]A hint, huh?
[388:45.72]Food.
[388:47.44]I'm not going to tell you anymore.
[388:50.17]Um, I don't have the slightest idea.
[388:52.77]Fruit-flavored candy.
[388:54.32]Maybe there are hints to be found in this room.
[388:56.06]Candies.
[388:57.00]Red candies.
[388:57.94]Strawberry candy.
[389:01.78]Junk food.
[389:04.10]This is a message for Jonathan Turner.
[389:08.08]Can you identify what I collect?
[389:09.88]This is the wall.
[389:11.26]Are you ready?
[389:12.58]Say your answer into the mic.
[389:14.92]He said he was collecting something you eat.
[389:18.28]Think about it.
[389:20.57]Strawberry candy.
[389:22.85]Where the fuck would you... I don't get it.
[389:27.96]What?
[389:29.62]Strawberry candy?
[389:35.70]Was there a note?
[389:40.06]Yeah, but how would you even know that?
[389:42.63]There were no red candies on the table, so who cares?
[389:47.45]Does it have to be red candies in a candy jar?
[389:54.59]There was strawberries on the jar, but no red ones on the table.
[390:00.89]Yeah, but yeah, somebody just said red doesn't need to be strawberry.
[390:03.43]Red could be like cherry, watermelon.
[390:06.45]It could be anything.
[390:09.42]Raspberry.
[390:14.80]Take ID.
[390:15.18]Which one should I check?
[390:20.00]If we run into Jonathan, I'd give this back to him.
[390:24.60]Okay, got his ID.
[390:27.84]Check bottle.
[390:28.94]Yeah.
[390:31.87]That's the one.
[390:34.41]Look at jar of candy.
[390:38.33]Are we certain these are candies and this guy's not just running some weird drug kind of ring?
[390:43.94]That's not red candy.
[390:45.86]That's his front.
[390:48.76]This is like ecstasy or something.
[390:53.20]Yeah, red candies, right?
[390:56.90]That's what the fucking kids are calling it these days.
[390:58.61]Don't do drugs, guys.
[390:59.55]It's not worth it.
[391:03.41]Check computer.
[391:07.41]Check computer.
[391:09.03]It's a terminal for control staff only.
[391:11.77]The registry's top page is displayed.
[391:13.49]Alright, open a door.

[391:32.74]Even from that warehouse back there.
[391:35.35]Okay.
[391:35.61]So now I get night vision mode.
[391:36.91]I need you to access the system from your end.
[391:42.01]What?
[391:47.09]So I'm accessing the computer.
[391:48.67]Leave the rest up to me.
[391:51.71]Yep, this should work without much fuss.
[391:57.07]I'll download the monitor camera expansion program.
[392:03.08]Access with management system.
[392:06.44]Infrared ray sensitivity upgrade.
[392:09.78]Install the latest generation of infrared monitor systems to see clearly under zero light conditions.
[392:18.57]Back to the warehouse.
[392:19.57]And we fight the last boss.
[392:20.71]Leave.
[392:20.91]First floor.
[392:21.19]Save game.
[392:21.45]Warehouse.
[392:21.73]Bingo.
[392:21.89]We're probably gonna beat this game.
[392:22.81]Save point.
[392:23.95]Run.
[393:00.19]Just like The Simpsons hit and run.
[393:04.73]I can't imagine this much more.
[393:05.77]We got a costume change.
[393:06.79]That means we're at the end of the arc here.
[393:10.63]When you get the cool costume change, you're at third act.
[393:21.73]Hallway.
[393:24.71]Leave the room?
[393:26.11]Run.
[393:26.43]Okay, yes.
[393:37.21]Where should I go?
[393:38.13]Warehouse.
[393:38.75]Warehouse.
[393:39.71]The warehouse.
[393:40.45]Okay.
[393:43.65]Run.
[393:44.37]Yes.
[393:51.56]You get a costume change every act and there are ten acts.
[393:53.80]Did you think this is a fucking game?
[393:55.18]Uh-oh.
[394:09.70]Night vision mode activated.
[394:10.80]Let's see how this is.
[394:19.28]This is gonna hurt my eyes, isn't it?
[394:22.46]No, it's just ugly.
[394:30.13]Uh...
[394:38.08]Not even a filter?
[394:40.55]I can't see you.
[394:41.73]That's a little too scary.
[394:43.37]I'm stopping.
[394:43.97]No, no.
[394:45.39]I was kidding.
[394:45.89]It was a joke.
[394:46.61]Oh my goodness.
[394:47.49]It was a joke.
[394:54.31]Now I'm stuck.
[394:56.79]Without your support, I don't have the confidence to go through.
[395:00.71]Maybe we need to find an alternate route.
[395:05.45]Where should I go?
[395:07.33]Warehouse.
[395:08.57]Understood.
[395:09.43]I'll go back.
[395:25.52]Can you see me?
[395:27.30]Yep.
[395:28.35]Allowing clear.
[395:36.11]Whoa.

[395:39.83]What about you?
[395:41.73]Can you see me?
[395:43.15]Yes.
[395:44.11]Can you really see me?
[395:47.53]Yeah, don't turn around and leave.
[395:48.81]I can see you.
[395:50.07]Can you tell me which hand I'm raising?
[395:53.10]Here goes.
[395:55.88]Go.
[395:57.72]Right.
[395:58.52]Yep.
[396:01.00]Ready?
[396:01.26]I have to prove that I can see you?
[396:08.07]You're not lifting up anything.
[396:09.73]You're not lifting up any hands.
[396:11.33]Yep, yep.
[396:13.87]Ready?
[396:16.35]Go.
[396:20.55]None.
[396:21.31]OK.
[396:21.77]I guess you can see me clearly.
[396:23.95]My eyes are getting accustomed to the darkness, too.
[396:28.15]I guess we can move on.
[396:29.90]Let's go.
[396:30.28]The enemy has been spotted.

[471:33.34]Just eat it while you're watching TV.
[471:35.40]Since a reporter can't help us, we'll have to show this footage to others and ask them.
[471:41.48]Who do you think we should ask?
[471:49.35]The president.
[471:50.33]Not what I said.

[487:50.83]You know how disgusting that's gonna be?
[487:53.05]You don't want that from my armpit.
[487:55.55]It's gonna be just a bunch of like matted up hair squished into the copier and some skin pushing out.

[499:13.50]Eight and a half hours?
[499:14.50]Yeah, damn.
[499:17.84]Still enjoying it, though.
[499:20.76]Observatory restaurant.
[499:22.27]We only get one chance to do this.
[499:26.27]This is not something I would ever go back and stream again.
[499:28.51]It just isn't.
[499:29.61]So, if we are this close, but not very much longer, then I'm just going to finish it.
[499:38.04]Enjoying in quotes.
[499:39.44]Yeah, I know.
[499:40.32]That's fine, though.
[499:45.13]What a disaster area.
[499:54.62]Listen.
[499:56.94]Do you remember this place?
[500:02.23]No.
[500:03.57]When things have changed this much, it's understandable.
[500:10.35]In the place where they held the first party in space, you were
[500:15.56]First space party ever.
[500:27.89]I don't think there's anyone here.
[500:29.17]Tell me an ending for the story, I need to go to bed.
[500:30.55]But we should check this area thoroughly.
[500:32.43]Uh, she is a double agent.
[500:34.93]She needs, she's trying to steal an orb.
[500:37.53]And she's pretending to be a waitress while she cases the whole place.
[500:41.75]And you can find out at the end that you were just helping her case this whole place.
[500:46.47]Oh, look at that!
[500:47.13]And actually help her steal this orb.
[500:49.75]And you were just compliant the whole time, we didn't even know.
[500:52.56]The hallway to guest section two is blocked by debris.
[500:59.39]Oh, right.
[501:00.83]When I was in guest section one, there was that huge tremor.
[501:04.23]There was an announcement that the corridor was sealed.
[501:06.27]And there's going to be a final showdown.
[501:07.99]We're not going any farther this way.
[501:09.41]Where I'm going to be able to make a bunch of noise.
[501:11.23]I'm going to be able to say, there she is!
[501:13.29]And she's going to be looking at me like, don't!
[501:15.51]We've become such good friends, and now you have a choice to actually let the FBI apprehend her.
[501:21.12]See, there it is again.
[501:22.22]By saying, there she is, or not saying anything, and she runs away.
[501:25.38]Hello?
[501:27.24]Is anyone there?
[501:30.58]If it weren't for this panel, I could reach the chandelier.
[501:34.61]It doesn't appear unbreakable.
[501:35.83]So blow it up.
[501:39.93]What should I do?
[501:40.75]Blow it up.
[501:41.55]Use launcher.
[501:44.57]Use launcher on panel.
[501:50.96]Don't stand that close, though.
[501:55.16]You're kidding me.
[502:07.21]Did I just waste that?
[502:15.52]Aren't there any instructions?
[502:16.76]I mean, there would be.
[502:17.78]Chandelier.
[502:18.62]The chandelier.
[502:20.04]OK.
[502:21.34]I can't get any closer than this.
[502:22.68]VI.
[502:24.91]What should I do?
[502:26.37]Come on.
[502:26.79]VI.
[502:29.27]Use launcher on panel.
[502:31.45]OK.
[502:32.55]Leave it up to me.
[502:34.51]You can do it again.
[502:40.00]That's great.
[502:40.32]VIP seat 1.
[502:40.52]Run.
[502:40.60]That's ridiculous.
[503:05.14]Look around, nerd.
[503:11.03]I may have fucked myself for the rest of this playthrough.
[503:15.33]Because I don't think I was supposed to use him on the chandelier.
[503:20.56]Save point.
[503:22.06]I'm doing a different save point.
[503:26.68]Because you need to blow up that one, you need to blow up the other ones.
[503:30.51]Where can I get some shells?
[503:39.12]I'm just gonna save down here, just in case.
[503:40.84]Someone's saying it's fine.
[503:43.82]It's probably fine, you're right.
[503:55.15]Soft locked?
[503:55.73]I don't think so.
[504:03.37]VIP seat three.
[504:04.97]VIP seat three.
[504:06.49]I can't go any farther if this thing is here.
[504:09.38]But I don't have any launcher ammo.
[504:11.66]Let's check somewhere else.
[504:14.37]Section 4.
[504:14.91]Okay, Section 4.
[504:16.79]Run.
[504:17.47]Yes.
[504:18.01]Have you tried swearing at her?
[504:22.45]I don't think so.
[504:23.75]I think maybe once.
[504:25.78]The floor is caved in.
[504:27.98]It looks like a big cavern.
[504:31.10]In the back.
[504:33.40]There's something there.
[504:37.94]One of those frog enemies.
[504:41.17]And a slug.
[504:41.71]There's always a slug.
[504:43.35]They didn't get rid of the dumb, stupid slug enemy.
[504:46.65]Body.
[504:48.25]Body.
[504:50.07]Front leg.
[504:51.80]Hind leg.
[504:53.50]Right stomach.
[504:54.40]Left stomach.
[504:56.24]Red stomach.
[504:58.04]Mouth.
[504:59.66]Red stomach.
[505:00.78]Red stomach.
[505:02.94]Two.
[505:04.15]Back.
[505:05.65]Back.

[505:13.69]Back.
[505:14.11]Kick.
[505:14.61]Stomach.
[505:16.01]Mmm.
[505:39.66]Reload.
[505:41.66]Reload.
[505:42.84]Focus on the head.
[505:43.44]Doesn't the X mean that it's already been destroyed?
[505:45.04]Shake.
[505:48.51]Head.
[505:49.93]Head.
[505:51.49]Yeah.
[505:51.97]Stomach.
[505:53.55]Stomach.
[505:58.77]Aim.
[506:00.24]Aim at stomach.
[506:01.60]Stop.
[506:02.84]Get off!
[506:05.42]Stomach.
[506:06.38]I think those things just suck.
[506:13.92]Just say auto-shoot.
[506:15.28]I'm not sure if you were here probably 30 times I've done auto-shoot.
[506:20.28]She misses almost every single shot.
[506:22.83]Every time.
[506:24.07]Almost every time.
[506:24.83]Just say enable hacks.
[506:27.45]Chandelier.
[506:41.94]The chandelier.
[506:43.34]Okay.
[506:46.63]I can't get any closer than this.
[506:47.99]I don't know why that thing died, but it did.
[506:54.89]Use launcher on panel.
[506:56.87]Okay.
[506:57.97]Leave it up to me.
[506:58.69]This had better be gone.
[507:03.72]You can hear my voice.
[507:05.06]My voice is starting to give out now.
[507:08.18]Thank goodness.
[507:08.60]But we push forward.
[507:09.72]Looks like that was the last one.
[507:19.95]He was in the middle?
[507:20.99]How did he not get hurt?
[507:21.97]It's okay.
[507:26.59]Shooting grenades at the middle.
[507:29.12]And he was in the middle.
[507:32.68]Are you with the rescue team?
[507:35.66]Are you alone?
[507:38.04]No.
[507:38.60]There were several dozen staff here even a little while ago.
[507:46.27]But they were eaten?
[507:49.40]I knelt and prayed to my family back on Earth.
[507:52.68]I'd given up all hope.
[507:58.54]But while I was doing so, the monsters... went away.
[508:04.55]You're lucky.
[508:06.07]But it's not safe here.
[508:07.09]Head for the receiving port.
[508:09.81]The rescue team has barricaded it.
[508:13.78]Thank you.
[508:15.86]Oh, this may help you.
[508:23.07]Thank you.
[508:29.54]I hope you'll be with your family soon.
[508:32.46]Will I see them again?
[508:34.77]Yes.
[508:36.33]I'm sure you will.
[508:46.23]And uh, the tests have determined that that was a lie.
[508:49.01]Right.
[508:49.37]Oh man.
[508:50.19]I'm gonna have to do something here.
[508:51.37]Hold on a second.
[508:51.77]Where is it on here?

[509:50.60]What do we do?
[509:54.50]Where do we go?

[517:46.47]Check in lamp.
[517:49.16]Um, this is already broken.
[517:51.58]Something in it.
[517:53.40]Look in the top of floor lamp.
[517:55.48]That's broken.
[517:58.60]Reach into floor lamp.
[518:01.58]Nah, I won't after all.
[518:07.63]Chip in floor lamp.
[518:10.67]Nah, I won't after all.
[518:14.00]Inspect lampshade the table.
[518:17.38]What are you saying?
[518:20.68]Look in floor lamp that's broken Grab are you talking about this?
[518:39.72]Break floor lamp that's broken

[518:51.04]Search lamp.
[518:52.20]That's broken.
[518:56.36]I don't even want it.
[518:57.50]Whatever it is.
[519:02.71]Look at the menu.
[519:05.15]It's the restaurant's menu.
[519:07.49]Then again, it's so dirty.
[519:09.83]I can't really be sure.

[519:43.31]Run as fast as you can from other side of room and try to break through fucking glass.
[519:51.69]Exit one, okay?
[520:10.19]She's going for it.
[520:12.26]She turns around and just like, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[520:14.22]Elevator.
[520:14.46]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[520:37.49]Am I really resorting to Daffy Duck stuff at this point?
[520:42.97]No, I'm not.
[520:48.39]Yeah, yeah.
[520:50.41]What was the code?
[520:54.62]0423.
[520:56.90]Code is 0423.
[520:59.34]Just get out of the fucking way, lady.
[521:01.36]I'll handle it.
[521:10.97]That's kind of creepy.
[521:13.69]Why would an elevator have a device that wraps around your neck?
[521:16.78]Passing through the central core of the station.
[521:20.16]This is a zero-gravity elevator.
[521:22.52]For your safety, please do not believe... I think we're almost done.
[521:28.08]We're getting to the top of the mountain here.
[521:31.03]There's section three, which was sealed during the tremor.
[521:35.97]Play a game with her before bed?
[521:40.02]I'll try to figure it out.
[521:42.74]Please enjoy the cosmic Vista.
[521:48.70]Sightseeing in space.
[521:54.48]They say that people finally began viewing themselves objectively after they started seeing Earth from space.
[522:03.30]Perhaps also...
[522:05.67]Maybe they felt a separation with reality as well.
[522:11.46]But what about you?
[522:13.66]Are you really alive?
[522:17.10]That is the absolute stupidest question I have ever heard anyone ask.
[522:21.82]And I hate you for asking it.
[522:24.24]Huh?
[522:25.74]I couldn't hear you very well.
[522:28.16]You're still alive, right?
[522:30.50]What were the first words your mother taught you as a child?
[522:35.16]Eat your vegetables.
[522:36.58]Didn't you hear me?
[522:38.64]Please, tell me.
[522:40.72]What were the first words your mother taught you as a baby?
[522:47.10]Run.
[522:52.47]Run.
[522:54.97]You must have been a cute baby.
[523:04.06]We seem to have reached the junction.
[523:08.35]All I say is fucking run.
[523:09.45]The first word I learned was wir.
[523:12.77]It's Jerma for we.
[523:15.71]You and I. We.
[523:21.56]No, that's great.
[523:23.90]Please tell me more.
[523:25.06]And taught me that word.
[523:30.12]I love the word.
[523:32.24]We.
[523:32.93]We.
[523:35.02]It makes it seem as if I'm not all alone.
[523:37.04]Is that thing too tight around your neck?
[523:39.00]Or are you alright?
[523:40.70]You losing oxygen?
[523:48.71]Hey, what's your favorite word or saying?
[523:56.88]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[523:59.00]Hmm.
[524:00.70]Then that's meaningful to you.
[524:05.11]You're probably thinking, why is she asking me this all of a sudden?
[524:10.89]Well, I just wanted to get to know you better.
[524:14.33]After all, we don't know anything about each other.
[524:17.79]Despite the fact that we're partners, right?
[524:21.31]Would you like to know more about me?
[524:25.16]No.
[524:25.93]Oh, don't be that way.
[524:27.95]Please, listen.
[524:28.95]She's been talking about how we're partners, we're such good friends, and I have denied every single bonding experiment here.
[524:37.94]You want me to tell you this?
[524:38.92]No, please don't.
[524:39.96]I want to steal that orb.
[524:40.84]You want to know why?
[524:41.68]No, I don't.
[524:42.18]Want to know more about me?
[524:43.90]I don't fucking want to know a damn thing about you.
[524:46.04]But I'm beginning to understand.
[524:49.64]It's better for people to be with someone rather than being alone.
[524:56.96]When we get back to Earth, maybe I'll get you to introduce me to someone.
[525:04.35]Please remain seated until the safety bar has been lifted.
[525:08.51]Maybe I'll let you go in a minute.
[525:09.48]What about you?
[525:10.08]Maybe I'll get you some fucking firearms training.
[525:14.70]But I suppose there's no chance of that, huh?
[525:34.43]Yeah, get her some glasses.
[525:35.46]We need to get you a prescription.
[525:54.29]A severe wobble was detected in the space station's rotation.
[525:57.87]What does wobble mean again?
[525:59.03]The station was placed on emergency status.
[526:02.35]Although the wobble will not interfere with informant.
[526:05.94]Elevator use is prohibited.
[526:09.38]I guess that means there's no turning back.
[526:12.20]The hotel is starting to collapse.
[526:14.18]We have to find Geno as soon as we can and ask him where the stone is.
[526:22.71]BoomerStreamer probably calls pizza places to order.
[526:27.29]You don't order pizza from a pizza place?
[526:35.66]Exit 1.
[526:36.02]Run.
[526:36.98]You can't order pizza from Amazon.

[539:19.38]It's just... Which one of these things do you want to spawn an enemy?
[539:22.08]Just leave after this.
[539:25.14]Check top of vending machine left.
[539:26.88]There's nothing special here.
[539:28.39]Top of left vending machine.
[539:30.68]Oh, there's a heal capsule.
[539:39.73]Recovery.
[539:41.95]Recovery.
[539:43.77]Back.
[539:45.02]Leave.
[539:46.46]Leave.
[539:50.78]Leave.
[539:51.62]What should I move?
[539:52.66]Walk.
[539:53.42]I'll walk.
[539:53.88]Out.
[539:56.35]Stop.
[539:56.91]Yes.
[539:57.89]Recovery.
[540:00.47]Recover.
[540:01.59]Yes.
[540:05.07]Alright.
[540:06.41]Um... Forget everything else.
[540:08.25]Hallway.
[540:09.09]Leave the room?
[540:10.79]Okay.
[540:11.39]Save point.
[540:12.01]The table.
[540:12.76]Okay.
[540:12.88]Save point.
[540:13.92]Save point.
[540:15.12]Save point!
[540:16.42]Don't just get enemies spawned in here.
[540:20.56]Check dirt.
[540:21.70]It's just a chair.
[540:25.48]Look at dirt.
[540:26.98]It's just a chair.
[540:31.99]Look at dirt.
[540:33.77]It's just a chair.
[540:38.83]Grab coffee cup.
[540:40.81]It's an ordinary teacup.
[540:45.72]Grab teacup on the left.
[540:48.72]I told you it's an ordinary teacup.
[540:50.76]It's not a teacup.
[540:53.01]Left coffee cup.
[540:55.63]I told you it's an ordinary teacup.
[541:00.62]Smear face in dirt.
[541:02.58]Are you talking about this?
[541:03.64]Yeah.
[541:05.44]Sure.
[541:08.04]Look at coffee bags.
[541:09.44]They're filter bags filled with ground coffee beans.
[541:12.41]There's sure a lot of them.
[541:15.45]I mean, I said coffee.
[541:17.35]Look at coffee cup.
[541:20.91]I told you, it's an ordinary teacup.
[541:23.81]Look at coffee mug.
[541:26.81]It's a Japanese tea mug.
[541:28.21]It's a tea mug.
[541:28.75]I think it's called Kiyomitsu Yaki.
[541:33.74]Well, look in it.
[541:34.52]Look in the tea mug.
[541:36.42]It's an ordinary tea mug.
[541:38.02]There's nothing in it.
[541:39.86]Pick up the Japanese tea mug.
[541:42.72]It's an ordinary tea mug.
[541:44.32]There's nothing in it.
[541:48.39]Read note.
[541:50.23]Are you talking about this?
[541:53.73]Read the report.
[541:54.69]Okay.
[541:54.79]Okay.
[541:56.26]Let's see.
[541:58.38]In addition to the incident reported several days ago, researcher Alan Honda's recent actions have been highly inappropriate and insubordinate.
[542:07.13]He has usurped authority on numerous occasions, removed test subjects without permission, and accessed government computers outside of regular hours.
[542:17.32]It's apparently about Alan.
[542:19.76]I'll read some more.
[542:21.55]I've got a big day tomorrow.
[542:22.69]Hurry up.
[542:23.95]Well, the stream tomorrow, I'll tell you, is going to be... Don't expect very much from tomorrow's stream.
[542:33.53]It's going to be me sitting in there with hockey equipment before... So we're streaming all night tonight because tomorrow's stream is going to be probably not that long.
[542:48.67]And I would really like it
[542:51.22]Look behind Japanese coffee mug.
[542:54.98]Ground coffee scattered everywhere.
[542:57.14]Look behind teacup.
[543:00.55]I told you it's an ordinary teacup.
[543:01.91]Look to the left of the teacup.
[543:04.93]I told you it's an ordinary teacup.
[543:07.73]Swat teacup with hand and look behind it.
[543:11.99]I told you it's an ordinary teacup.
[543:14.58]Search coffee grounds.
[543:15.94]They're commercial grade coffee bags.
[543:20.70]Search coffee grounds.
[543:22.90]They're commercial-grade coffee bags.
[543:27.03]Look at coffee grounds.
[543:29.31]They're commercial-grade coffee bags.
[543:31.11]Look at coffee powder.
[543:32.59]Ground coffee scattered everywhere.
[543:35.79]Is this someone's idea of a joke?
[543:37.27]Clean up coffee powder.
[543:39.08]Huh?
[543:40.04]Clean up the coffee granules?
[543:42.30]Is that what you're saying?
[543:44.20]You have to be kidding me.
[543:48.56]That's not how you clean.
[543:53.96]The manager's office key.
[543:55.58]Good.
[543:56.44]What's it doing here?
[543:58.98]Now we can get into the manager's office.
[544:02.76]We're not done, though, because there's... How do I get you to do this?
[544:08.11]Grab tea mug.
[544:10.33]It's an ordinary tea mug.
[544:11.93]There's nothing in it.
[544:13.19]Clean tea mug.
[544:14.55]It's an ordinary tea mug.
[544:16.13]There's nothing in it.
[544:18.96]How do I get her to interact with that?
[544:24.34]Check tea mug.
[544:26.30]It's an ordinary tea mug.
[544:27.52]Check mug.
[544:27.94]There's nothing in it.
[544:31.57]It's a small chip.
[544:33.35]Lucky me.
[544:44.72]Check box.
[544:45.60]They're all blue cups.
[544:47.52]You'll need to be more specific for me to tell.
[544:49.82]Look in the box.
[544:51.30]I read it already.
[544:53.02]Look in the cardboard box.
[544:53.84]Save point.
[544:54.32]Alright.
[545:27.12]At this point, I don't even know which one is the right one to do.
[545:30.02]Because I don't have any heals.
[545:34.30]I'm so screwed.
[545:47.14]Hallway.
[545:54.55]Where the teacup is a hat.
[546:01.08]You forgot the galley?
[546:01.82]The galley spawns, like, four enemies.
[546:03.50]Just put me back in this room.
[546:09.16]Please, listen!
[546:10.04]That's what I call music volume six!
[546:31.39]Leave the dangerous stuff to me.
[546:32.98]It's so good.
[546:33.48]Take an escape shuttle out of here.
[546:36.12]Hey, what should I do?
[546:38.48]Why are you still here?
[546:39.50]Shoot Gino.
[546:40.78]Hurry, I need you to tell me what I should do.
[546:43.54]Shoot him.
[546:44.46]If I run off, I won't be able to ask him about the stone.
[546:48.06]What should I do?
[546:49.20]Shoot him.
[546:49.72]I'm not going to shoot him.
[546:51.28]Come on.
[546:53.34]Hit him in the face.
[546:54.02]Hey, what should I do?
[546:56.62]Punch him.
[546:57.48]Hurry, I need you to tell me what I should do.
[547:00.41]Punch Gino.
[547:01.51]He's desperate.
[547:02.73]He's not listening to anything I say.
[547:04.27]You hit plenty of times.
[547:05.55]Help me.
[547:06.05]Shoot.
[547:13.69]This is senseless.
[547:15.40]I'm going to lock you in the cell again.
[547:25.06]Punch him.
[547:25.66]Shoot him.
[547:26.44]Push him.
[547:26.92]Punch him.
[547:37.36]You hit me so hard, you knocked my fucking earpiece out of my head.
[547:42.57]Now you gotta begin from the starting cell.
[547:53.01]He was listening to me.
[547:54.85]She wasn't listening to me, but he was.
[547:57.50]Hit her?
[547:57.78]Are you sure?
[547:59.24]Punch?
[547:59.60]I don't know.

[548:41.74]Please listen.
[548:42.26]I need you to watch this stick.
[548:43.72]Listen to me, Rio.
[548:44.40]It's a very clear sentence.
[548:45.54]You know I care about you.
[548:49.21]Leave the dangerous stuff to me.
[548:51.15]Take an escape shuttle out of here.
[548:53.95]Hey, what should I do?
[548:55.19]Threaten.
[548:57.11]I can't.
[548:58.61]I'm no match for him unarmed.
[549:01.26]Try to talk to him.
[549:02.64]No way, he's not listening to anything I say.
[549:05.97]Threaten.
[549:07.01]Can't.
[549:07.85]He says he's gonna lock me up again.

[549:23.51]Flee.

[549:27.62]Pistol whip.
[549:28.30]Help.
[549:29.02]Hey, what should I do?
[549:31.18]Use gun.
[549:32.92]That's every option.
[549:34.74]There's no other option.
[549:37.40]Run away, punch, threaten, kick, scream, fight.
[549:42.98]What is the other option?
[549:49.12]Threaten is the right answer.
[549:51.98]I said, I did, didn't I say that?
[549:54.18]Talk to him.
[549:54.74]He won't listen to me.
[549:55.88]Threaten him.
[549:56.60]I can't do that.
[549:57.84]Punch him.
[549:58.52]No, he'll get me.
[550:00.36]Shoot him.
[550:00.84]I can't shoot him.
[550:02.86]Then you're just gonna die.

[586:31.99]And because I'm tired, my Boston accent just comes out even harder.
[586:41.34]L2 to skip.
[586:45.30]L2.
[586:45.68]L2's not doing anything.
[586:50.34]Super Boston accent.

[591:53.40]Your voice that's coming over the microphone.
[591:59.02]Yeah?
[591:59.44]It's pretty clear.
[592:00.14]I can make out almost everything you said.
[592:03.72]Your voice is easy to follow.
[592:05.12]Very easy to follow.
[592:06.98]It's very easy to follow.
[592:11.19]Except when it's not.
[592:12.55]Recover.

[592:48.76]Yes.
[592:49.80]She can hear me perfectly fine like this.
[592:59.16]We just get an extra thousand viewers?
[593:04.43]Was there a... I didn't see a raid or a host.
[593:07.01]Maybe there was.
[593:09.35]Did somebody just do a host or a raid?
[593:20.18]Oh, it's a host from Vinny.
[593:22.34]Awesome, cool.
[593:24.12]Thanks a lot, Vinny.
[593:25.90]Hope you had a good stream.
[593:27.40]If you're not following Vinny, do it.
[593:30.99]Vinny and Joel tonight.
[593:32.19]Seriously.
[593:32.57]Thanks, guys.
[593:35.05]I almost forget.
[593:35.47]It's been, like, so long that my brain forgot.
[593:57.29]Alright.
[594:01.69]I've been screaming long enough to get hosted by Vinny and Joel.
[594:08.81]Alright, this time I'm going to be very, very slow.
[594:12.17]I'm going to be very careful.
[594:13.63]I'm going to make sure I get it completely right 100% of the time.
[594:15.87]I'm going to slow down.
[594:18.03]I'm going to pause.
[594:18.55]We're going to use our VATS system that they're giving us.
[594:29.74]Dude, the launcher first?
[594:35.59]No, you gotta get him on the ground.
[594:37.51]Trying to get behind him?

[597:06.78]Yes.
[597:16.88]Hallway.
[597:17.80]Alternate dodge directions instead of going into a wall.
[597:26.53]Well, when I say dodge left and she dodges right... That's kind of impossible.

[597:49.96]So I'm barely, I'm melting.
[597:57.37]Which reminds me, I really should get some more water.
[598:03.01]I really just wish we didn't have to watch the cutscene again.
[598:19.78]If it wasn't for the cutscene... Why can't you... It's usually select, but... This is such an important cutscene, apparently, that you can't... No way.
[598:53.29]I'm gonna do, like, fucking stretches while this is going on.
[598:56.74]By the way, yeah, like, get up and, like, move your legs around.

[604:14.78]The rescue team arrived at the receiving port.
[604:18.12]Just eight of the 50 guests are under guard there.

[605:41.55]What is this?
[605:41.89]Is this the thing I just did?
[605:49.45]Is this the noise I just made?
[605:50.35]I might as well just get it over with and hear it.
[606:04.67]I'm so tired.

[608:41.75]Operator, are you busy with something else?
[608:59.56]This mic, did it break somehow?
[609:22.95]Your instructions are too slow.
[609:25.41]I've had enough.
[609:48.93]Operator, what should I do?
[610:08.31]Aren't there any instructions?
[610:33.34]Aren't there any instructions?
[610:52.98]Alright.

[615:35.30]Can I open this?
[615:37.06]I don't think it can be opened by analyzing it.
[615:38.58]It can't be opened.
[615:39.86]To open it, I would have to manually enter the combination using the dial.
[615:43.35]Somebody look it up.
[615:44.69]What do we do?
[615:48.07]Open safe.
[615:49.15]To open it, I would have to manually enter the combination using the dial.
[615:53.32]Of course I don't have a clue how to open it, so you'll have to guide me.
[615:56.24]Uh-huh.
[616:01.14]How many notches should I turn?
[616:04.26]I don't know.
[616:07.57]69... No.
[616:17.03]Um... Hey, how much am I supposed to turn this?
[616:24.13]How many notches should I turn?
[616:30.39]Is nobody going to help me here?
[616:33.79]Two.
[616:34.73]OK, I'll rotate it to two.
[616:37.39]Hey, a lamp just went on.
[616:46.43]OK, good.
[616:47.90]What should I check?
[616:49.72]Check.
[616:50.80]What should I check?
[616:53.77]Turn left.
[616:54.99]How many notches should I turn?
[616:57.32]Two.
[616:58.18]Okay, I'll rotate it to two.
[617:04.00]Turn right.
[617:06.24]Okay, I'll rotate it seven to the right.
[617:16.67]It's been reset.
[617:18.91]I guess we screwed up.
[617:20.56]So the dial must be rotated correctly three times to open... Hey, how much am I supposed to turn this?
[617:25.59]Four.
[617:26.73]So, we're gonna give up on the safe?
[617:29.73]Okay.
[617:30.97]Can you wait a second?
[617:39.69]Open safe.
[617:41.33]The safe.
[617:42.05]Okay.
[617:47.42]How many notches should I turn?
[617:49.16]Four.
[617:50.06]Okay, I'll rotate it to four.
[617:57.00]Six.
[617:58.02]Okay, I'll rotate it to six.
[618:07.07]Two.
[618:08.03]Okay, I'll rotate it to two.
[618:11.85]Um, we blew it again.
[618:15.14]We'll have to start over.
[618:17.30]Four.
[618:18.20]Okay, I'll rotate it to four.
[618:25.17]Left six.
[618:26.83]Okay.

[618:38.20]Okay.

[618:45.16]Okay.
[618:45.54]Right two.
[618:50.92]To the right.
[618:51.66]Okay.

[618:54.75]Okay.
[618:55.33]I'll rotate it four to the right.
[619:02.05]Left.
[619:03.13]To the left.
[619:04.17]Okay.
[619:05.54]How far should I turn it?
[619:06.52]Six.
[619:07.46]Okay.
[619:07.94]I'll rotate it six to the left.
[619:17.85]Right.
[619:18.65]To the right, okay?
[619:20.41]How far should I turn it?
[619:21.73]Two.
[619:22.61]Okay, I'll rotate it two to the right.
[619:25.63]Got it.
[619:27.85]It opened, operator.

[619:46.36]What is this disk?

[619:51.54]It belongs to Alan Honda.
[619:55.30]Hang on a minute.
[619:58.96]Where are you going?
[620:04.30]Gonna put it on the big screen?
[620:06.20]This will let us watch that disk we found.
[620:09.42]Good.
[620:10.00]It doesn't appear to be broken.
[620:23.92]Soft Edge Corporation?
[620:28.04]Paracelsus Plan.
[620:30.69]That didn't say plan, it says project.
[620:32.79]Are you familiar with the Philosopher's Stone?
[620:36.09]It is said to have been in the possession of Paracelsus, a 16th century European philosopher.
[620:43.16]Capable of generating intense healing power, it was a stone that defied human comprehension.
[620:50.14]It was studied by some scholars of the time, but despite lengthy research, their efforts were in vain.
[620:58.21]At long last, however, we have succeeded in reproducing the philosopher's stone.
[621:04.89]This is it.
[621:06.41]This is it.
[621:08.45]The Philosopher's Stone we have created is identical in composition and structure to the original, and its potency is even greater.
[621:18.18]An example will make this clear.
[621:20.98]This photo presents a simulation of the effects of the original Philosopher's Stone as noted in ancient manuscripts.
[621:29.00]The next photo shows the results of an experiment based on the instructions in those ancient documents using a philosopher's stone that we created.
[621:38.64]As you can see, our philosopher's stone is capable of producing effects precisely opposite to those produced by the original.
[621:48.27]Instead of healing a living thing so that it may survive, it curses the organism, which remains alive.
[621:56.55]a number of possible results of the use of this stone can be imagined but the most effective is the use of an accursed hex capable of plunging a civilized society into chaos this very stone has been spared in order that your country may carry out its plan of battle and we believe that this is the only measure available
[622:24.38]I'm gonna go break the Beauty and the Beast, uh, rose glass.
[622:28.48]That's an alien snow globe.
[622:31.49]Joseph Kraft?
[622:38.25]Corrupt living creatures with curses.
[622:43.50]Just as I thought.
[622:45.06]That's the best thing I've seen all night.
[622:47.34]Aliens and UFOs.
[622:49.90]It was all a lie.
[622:52.69]This lady is about to burp.
[622:54.48]Like she has been drinking only soda for the last week.
[622:57.20]She was doing a burp voice, like controlling a burp.
[623:02.04]And the reason for the philosopher's stone was that it was part of a scientific... That was perfect.
[623:18.72]Okay.
[623:20.33]Hotel Registry.
[623:21.94]The hotel registry.

[623:37.55]The hotel was booked for years to come.

[654:49.20]This can't be!
[654:52.06]Listen, can you analyze this device?
[654:56.45]Time fuse can be turned off by entering the passcode.
[655:00.10]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[655:02.76]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[655:22.72]Okay, yes.
[655:23.40]That's easy.
[655:25.14]Today is December 24th, 2029.
[655:26.70]So the last digit of each one would be 249.
[655:30.62]That's easy.
[655:32.80]Add them up and enter it.
[655:36.21]What?
[655:36.53]I just missed it.
[655:39.29]End of the sum of the date.
[655:41.29]End of the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[655:44.37]Just tell me what it is.
[655:46.77]I'm too tired.
[655:47.47]65?
[655:47.83]We're wasting time.
[655:50.61]2 plus 4 plus 9 is 15.
[655:53.11]No, that's 14.
[655:53.53]How do I backspace?
[655:54.95]15.
[655:54.97]Yes.
[655:56.01]That seems to have worked.
[655:58.74]How about you read the instructions for the next step?
[656:06.04]OK.
[656:12.95]Enter the number of guests checked in the hotel.
[656:15.13]How would you ever know that?
[656:16.99]Enter the number of guests checked in the hotel.
[656:20.82]This is easy, too.
[656:23.74]The answer was in Tanaka's note.
[656:26.88]It's 13.
[656:27.22]Okay, enter it.
[656:28.92]13.
[656:28.94]Easy.
[656:29.67]Please be careful with this.
[656:39.69]Ah, it's wrong.
[656:40.51]It's not 13.
[656:41.72]It's not the number of survivors.
[656:43.40]It's the number of checked-in guests.
[656:45.10]I was gonna say, it's... Check Manager Tanaka's note carefully.
[656:48.04]Hundreds.
[656:48.44]Enter that number.
[656:49.50]Check the note.
[656:50.32]Check the note?
[656:51.98]Out of 50 guests, 13 survivors as of 2-16.
[656:54.16]So 50.
[656:54.28]50 guests.
[656:55.00]Right, right.
[656:55.86]It's on Tanaka's note.
[656:57.40]Hurry, enter the code.
[657:10.87]50.
[657:11.73]Agreed.
[657:12.30]The number of checked in guests should be 50.
[657:13.70]Enter it.
[657:17.30]If we ran out now, it would be a disaster.
[657:19.08]How do I do?
[657:20.14]We have to defuse the bomb somehow.
[657:21.72]Enter the code.
[657:31.26]Done.
[657:32.26]That was too close.
[657:36.58]OK, what's the next step for defusing this?
[657:40.48]And to the sum of the last digits of P.M.
[657:43.12]Takeyama's birthday.
[657:46.14]And to the sum of the last digits of P.M.
[657:48.32]Takeyama's birthday.
[657:49.75]D.M.Y.
[657:50.31]What's that?
[657:53.41]How are we supposed to know the Prime Minister's birthday?
[657:58.37]Nope.
[657:59.25]What do we do?
[658:00.33]What do we do?
[658:01.29]What do we do?
[658:01.84]I don't know his birthday.
[658:06.90]Birthday.
[658:08.24]It was really nice knowing you.
[658:12.22]You're right.
[658:14.30]Didn't he say something about that at some point?
[658:17.57]Did he?
[658:23.59]I thought we were just dead.
[658:24.71]I thought the bomb was gonna explode.
[658:26.51]I mean, hopefully, if it triggered up a memory, that's great.
[658:30.99]No.
[658:32.21]I can't.
[658:34.05]It's all up to you.
[658:36.69]Go ahead.
[658:37.97]Enter the final number.
[658:39.77]Please be extra careful.
[658:52.57]It is also my 60th birthday today, so this occasion is extra meaningful for me.
[658:58.27]Did he turn off the fucking dubstep?
[659:02.33]What did he say?
[659:03.01]60?
[659:03.05]Truth be told, it is also my 60th birthday today, so this occasion is extra meaningful for me.
[659:13.45]So it was 60.
[659:15.19]So 60 times, what is the rule?
[659:18.57]into the sum of the last digits of the birthday.
[659:23.71]So 60, so that would be... So what is today?
[659:29.70]What year is this supposed to be?
[659:30.78]2021, 2029 minus 60 is 30.
[659:45.56]2029 minus 60 is... 19... 90... Oh, yeah, you're right.
[659:48.38]Okay, hold on.
[659:51.52]So that'd be 30.
[659:52.16]No, no, no, it wouldn't.
[659:53.66]Would it be 30?
[659:54.28]It's 15!
[659:54.56]Oh, because you only need the last digit.
[659:57.14]Okay, 15.
[659:57.46]I get it.
[659:57.98]Yeah, you only need the last digit.
[660:30.18]Don't drop it.
[660:30.70]Would you like to take a break?
[660:40.21]Is it taking you 11 hours playing this game to actually ask me that?
[660:54.06]Phew.
[660:59.19]Those are just binoculars.
[661:01.13]Easy.
[661:01.33]Don't just put it on the ground.

[662:21.30]We'll find her.
[662:28.25]Put that bomb back in there.
[662:31.82]Oh, it's Master Chief and his friend, Master... Chief.

[664:37.42]I just accidentally pressed square.
[664:46.34]That was some Mortal Kombat bullshit right there.

[671:07.02]I don't even know your name.
[671:16.89]If we get back to Earth safely, you think we could actually meet somewhere?
[671:21.55]Like,
[671:23.31]normal friends a few days ago I ordered a pizza from an app and you know some pizza places have where you can make your own pizza well I got a little overzealous and I thought I was making something really great and it was a pesto pesto pizza well there is Naomi I'm kind of envying her right now I'm sure Naomi is safe somewhere
[671:53.50]We'll find her.
[671:54.16]With grilled chicken on it.
[671:55.62]We've got to.
[671:56.78]And I didn't put any sauce on the pizza.
[671:58.96]It was like, sauce, no sauce.
[672:00.46]What are you doing?
[672:02.38]Meat, grilled chicken.
[672:03.32]I could just press buttons.
[672:04.82]What are you doing?
[672:05.42]And I put like olive oil on it and pesto and garlic.
[672:06.96]It was terrible.
[672:07.48]That's none of your concern.
[672:08.36]It was the worst pizza I've probably ever eaten.
[672:10.76]I knew there was something weird.
[672:13.89]You guys aren't a rescue team?
[672:15.97]Pipe down and hand that over.
[672:17.99]Holy mother of... That thing...
[672:23.91]I can't skip it.
[672:33.00]I'm trying.
[672:33.50]Wait, is that Master Chief?
[672:34.54]The Master Chief?
[672:36.02]Okay, don't fuck it up.
[672:44.79]Select close.
[672:47.10]Pesto pizza is good.
[672:48.06]Yeah, but it was no sauce on it.
[672:49.52]It was just like a piece.
[672:50.58]It was like a cracker.
[672:52.46]It was a really crunchy cracker with chicken and a little bit of pesto on it.
[672:57.02]Some olive oil.
[672:58.70]Jeremy, you're the worst person I know.
[673:00.55]You don't really believe that, do you?
[673:03.99]I hope you don't.
[673:06.21]No.
[673:06.67]Okay, close door.
[673:07.45]Okay.
[673:27.37]Caesar is pretty good, too.
[673:28.45]Do you have, like, a Caesar pizza?
[673:30.39]It's Caesar dressing, grilled chicken sometimes, and lettuce.
[673:35.47]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[673:38.97]Close the door.
[673:40.48]Close the door.
[673:42.02]Close.
[673:43.46]I got it in time, didn't I?
[673:59.65]Mustard a ketchup should shoot mustard shoot the buster or the ketchup Shoot red
[674:30.95]Which one is it?
[674:36.37]Shoot red.
[674:38.11]Shoot red lever.
[674:40.35]Shoot the lever.
[674:41.81]Shoot red and yellow lever.
[674:44.21]Chat, help me out here.
[675:04.47]Aim at lever.
[675:05.25]Shoot.
[675:06.47]Shoot top lever.
[675:07.37]Red.
[675:07.47]Shoot red.
[675:07.79]Out of cover red.
[675:14.80]Shoot red.
[675:37.87]Let's do it shoot just shoot right again Yellow now Shoot yellow shoot
[676:04.21]No, no, not another grenade!
[676:05.47]Not another grenade!
[676:07.09]Not another grenade!
[676:25.56]Why did I stop?
[676:26.12]Because... People were telling me that...
[676:30.03]They could shoot The real question you should be asking yourself is why did it take like 17 times saying shoot red shoot red lever red lever shoot red shoot red Why did it take that many times?
[676:48.20]That's the question you should be asking.
[677:09.19]I can't fucking believe it.
[677:11.75]And the reason why is because somebody said, one guy, and I listened, it was, when you go out of cover, you could just get shot by one of these guys.
[677:21.67]If there, is that true?
[677:31.81]So, wait, so it is true.
[677:33.91]So I would have just died anyways if I did shoot yellow, yellow lever.
[677:41.49]I can't believe I have to do that whole thing again.
[677:43.37]What were they thinking?
[678:01.88]What the hell were you thinking?
[678:07.59]You put an unskippable like seven minutes of cutscene.
[678:12.14]And a bomb diffusion thing.
[678:14.00]With a save point here.
[678:14.84]And this is it.
[678:15.70]You gotta do it again.

[684:04.48]Huh?
[684:04.74]Operator, hold on a sec.
[684:07.64]This cord, what is this?

[684:25.23]The time fuse can be shi- yes.
[684:26.74]There's no mistake.
[684:28.14]It's a bomb.
[684:29.54]Can you check how to defuse it?
[684:33.21]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.

[685:01.47]Does the game have more crust now?
[685:03.61]Does the game have more crust now?
[685:12.27]Yes.
[685:13.71]I restarted the PS2.
[685:15.53]Another game has extra crust.
[685:17.24]That seems to have worked.
[685:19.30]How about you read the instructions for the next step?
[685:23.22]Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.
[685:26.37]It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
[685:28.71]How the fuck am I ever gonna get up and stream tomorrow?
[685:39.86]Enter the number of guests.
[685:40.76]Wait a second.
[685:42.96]It's wrong.
[685:44.96]It's not 13.
[685:46.16]It's not the number of survivors.
[685:47.80]It's the number of checked in guests.
[685:49.46]You're not.
[685:50.34]I'm going to sleep through my own death.
[685:52.59]It's very possible.
[686:06.57]And here's another, like, awful thing.

[686:13.88]We have, both of our offices are across the house from each other, right?
[686:18.82]But his bedroom is right here.

[687:18.62]What do we do?
[687:19.54]Here's $100 million in cash.
[687:23.75]You're right.
[687:25.81]Didn't he say something about that at some point?
[687:42.33]Come on.
[687:43.69]I can't.
[687:45.53]It's all up to you.
[687:47.05]Go ahead.
[687:49.23]Enter the final number.
[687:50.91]Please be extra careful.

[688:04.67]There, you got your fucking toy from Dave and Buster's.
[688:41.03]Am I about to break my own record here?
[688:42.61]Or the longest stream ever?
[688:43.89]Would you like to take a break?
[688:47.09]No, I don't, actually.
[688:48.17]You know, I would love to take a break.
[688:49.91]I'd love for you to go to the save point that's over there.
[688:58.74]Phew.
[689:03.88]This whole time, I've been trying to remember your face.
[689:06.30]There you go again.
[689:07.12]But I can't.
[689:08.30]Not anymore.
[689:09.65]Here comes the sob story about how she can't wait to be my best friend and want to fall in love with me and shit.
[689:17.34]I want you to know I really am grateful.
[689:21.48]If it weren't for you, I'd be dead.
[689:33.78]Here we are.
[689:35.80]Complete strangers.
[689:37.32]Entrusting one another with our lives.
[689:40.42]Say safe point.
[690:12.63]Yes, if when we get to the next part of this game here, you listen carefully and you do a very good job and you listen.
[690:20.46]Oh, yeah.
[690:21.76]Well, there is Naomi.
[690:24.94]I'm kind of envying her right now.
[690:30.42]I'm sure Naomi is safe somewhere.
[690:33.33]We'll find her.
[690:35.45]We've got to.
[690:41.32]Please, get me out of here.
[690:46.03]Get me out of this.
[690:48.95]Get me out.

[691:44.74]Shoot red.
[691:45.32]Tell her to shoot left soldier, right soldier, then shoot the red or yellow.
[691:51.26]And when you shoot the lever that's higher of the two, just shoot red.
[691:57.34]Shoot red.
[691:58.56]Or do I have to say red lever?
[692:06.88]Shoot red lever.
[692:13.27]Just red lever.
[692:14.51]I'll take care of this.
[692:18.71]Here we go.

[694:07.85]Shoot red.
[694:10.49]Right soldier.
[694:13.97]Clip that.
[694:14.47]I want that clipped because I want to see how perfectly I said shoot red.
[694:21.30]I want to see it.
[694:23.78]Give it to me.
[694:31.71]I need to know.
[694:33.25]Because...
[694:37.17]That was offensive to me.
[694:40.03]That was offensive.
[694:46.64]Who has it?
[694:58.21]Just play the ending on YouTube.
[695:08.16]why I said shoot red and she said right soldier and she stood there maybe I'm still alive

[696:56.48]I'm going to do the meditation thing again.
[697:00.23]Everybody do it.
[697:16.65]This five-minute meditation can reduce nervousness before events such as interviews, beginning a new job or school, or dealing with everyday stressful situations, or just whenever you want to feel calm.
[697:37.78]To begin, sit on a chair with your feet on the floor.
[697:44.09]You used this twice in a week.
[697:46.79]No, this is not cheers to you.
[697:48.75]What am I doing with my mouth?
[697:52.01]In her mouth?
[697:52.59]In her mouth.

[698:20.80]I can't- we're gonna- no, we're doing cheers to you.
[698:26.68]It's a good opportunity for it.
[698:28.72]Not yet, though.
[698:29.26]I just don't want you guys to hear this awful fucking music anymore.
[698:42.49]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[698:49.44]You're abusing its power.
[698:50.48]I need it right now.
[698:53.28]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[698:59.70]He's doing it the same re- Yeah.

[699:17.82]How do I even turn this back on?
[699:22.25]I don't get time for jokes.
[699:24.82]That seems to have worked.
[699:25.82]How about you read the instructions for the next step?
[699:29.50]I took a number of guesses to check the loadout.
[699:33.75]This is easy, too.
[699:34.33]The answer was in Tanaka's note.
[699:36.27]I'm going to sleep through this grade one more.
[699:39.95]13.
[699:40.13]OK, enter it.
[699:51.78]it's wrong it's not 13. it's not the number of survivors it's the number of checked in guests check manager to knock his note carefully and enter that number this is the last time I'm doing this I promise that was too close okay what's the next step
[700:22.39]That's gonna be me sleeping in hockey gear.

[701:19.96]Yeah, they did.
[701:20.50]There's about 3,500 of them over here.
[701:22.16]No, I can't.
[701:22.56]It's all up to you.
[701:24.20]Go ahead.
[701:25.16]Enter the final number.
[701:26.36]Please be extra careful.
[701:47.91]Okay, got it So it's okay
[702:20.28]Let's go.
[702:20.66]Let's do it.
[702:21.24]Would you like to take a break?
[702:23.01]No.
[703:04.13]This whole time, I've been trying to remember your face, but I can't.
[703:08.49]Not anymore.
[703:09.05]I want you to know.
[703:18.25]Say it again.
[703:20.02]I really am grateful.
[703:21.70]If it weren't for you, I'd be dead.
[703:33.98]here we are stay out of the light
[703:52.34]There's something alive in the darkness.
[703:56.38]I can feel the power and it's mine.
[704:00.36]Yes, I have walked in the shadow.
[704:03.38]Normal friends?
[704:04.32]Yes.
[704:07.52]Thanks for being considerate.
[704:09.60]You're welcome.
[704:10.16]Anyway, you'll have Naomi back.
[704:12.34]I don't even know who that was.
[704:17.04]I typed in heavy metal into YouTube and clicked the first one.
[704:21.27]Aw, Fozzy and I aren't going to get muted.
[704:29.80]That, like, ten seconds blank.
[704:30.74]Nah, the hell with them.
[704:55.48]This is the final attempt, whatever happens here is... Because I have to wake up and... Dude, I can't not... I can't miss that stream.
[705:06.11]It's been a year in the making.
[705:07.55]More than that.
[705:08.15]It's been almost a full year in the making.
[705:11.34]I can't just not stream tomorrow because I'm gonna go to bed at like 5 a.m.
[705:18.52]Those men... I knew it.
[705:20.14]They weren't... a rescue team.
[705:30.33]Just don't stop screaming.
[705:32.49]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[705:36.83]We'll just assume the worst.
[705:41.08]No.
[705:43.42]Alright.
[705:44.44]So it's shoot red.
[705:47.02]Left soldier, right soldier.
[706:03.82]I did it right, but for some reason I thought I did it wrong, right?
[706:19.19]Left soldier.
[706:19.65]Right soldier.
[706:20.33]I have to shoot the soldiers.
[706:32.16]Is there a- is there a hide?
[706:33.62]For god's sake, hide.
[706:36.40]Quick!
[706:37.44]What should I do?
[706:38.58]Throw it away!
[706:42.12]Shoot.
[706:44.32]You're gonna die if you don't think it's something- You want me to fight?
[706:48.03]Gotcha!
[706:48.61]What?
[706:52.57]Oh my god, thank fucking god!
[706:54.41]It moved!
[706:57.75]I can disengage the arm by turning the lever.
[707:04.06]Left soldier.
[707:07.30]Right soldier.
[707:09.55]Right soldier.
[707:11.45]What the fuck are you doing?
[707:12.53]Right.
[707:13.23]Hide.
[707:15.31]Left soldier.
[707:17.67]Left.
[707:18.23]You fucking idiot.
[707:20.03]That's enough.
[707:53.42]When I'm being just fought when I'm being pulled both ways if Left soldier right soldier.
[708:01.45]It just ruined the ruin of that.
[708:02.65]Anyway, I You can't call me a quitter this game I can't I can't not remember
[708:25.92]I will see you guys tomorrow, today, whatever the fuck it is.
[708:30.43]Stream's probably not gonna start until 4 p.m.
[708:32.85]Pacific.
[708:34.31]Because this is going very late.
[708:42.71]Watch the end- no, I might finish this tomorrow.
[708:48.00]I think I'm actually gonna jump back into this and finish it tomorrow.
[708:57.25]So 4 p.m.
[708:57.81]Pacific is when the stream is gonna start.
[709:03.88]Merry Christmas.
[709:05.22]Or whatever.
[709:09.34]Today?
[709:09.70]Today.
[709:10.16]Like, today.
[709:10.69]Because another stream is gonna happen today.
[709:13.07]And it's also because I only have no health.
[709:24.32]I actually think the game is fairly fun and funny and interesting.
[709:27.20]So, I mean... But, for the sake of how late this is and how... I have to get up and stream again.
[709:40.25]We're probably going to... Let's see here.
[709:46.63]Let me see how many bits there are.
[709:48.29]Because there are a lot of subs too.
[709:50.83]I want to show the credits at least.
[709:53.57]Let's go through some of these.
[709:54.97]Because I think... Oh no, never mind.
[710:04.96]That's not going to work.
[710:14.18]Yeah, I think I have to just save the bitreading for tomorrow.
[710:20.82]Because this is a lot of, people give a ton of money today.
[710:24.66]Like an absolute monumental amount of fucking money.
[710:29.55]And this stream will go on for like another two and a half hours.
[710:33.49]Which would then be about 5 plus AM Pacific.
[710:43.70]So I'm going to run the credits.
[710:45.53]We have that website that tracks everything.
[710:48.49]So I'm going to go over the bits from today tomorrow.
[710:51.95]So tomorrow you're going to read bits before I was... No.
[710:57.60]I'm going to probably go through them as quickly as I can.
[711:05.71]But holy shit, guys.
[711:08.66]It was seriously like... It was like probably almost three grand today.
[711:14.78]Including subscriptions, bits.
[711:18.80]There were hundreds of gifted subs.
[711:21.84]Thousands of dollars in bits.
[711:23.38]It was insane.
[711:26.08]And I'm really sorry that I just... I really don't have it in me mentally for energy right now to go through and do them all.
[711:34.14]Just know that
[711:36.97]I can't thank you enough.
[711:39.41]Thousands of fucking dollars.
[711:40.59]In one day.
[711:44.83]So.
[711:45.85]I'm gonna get some sleep.
[711:46.71]I'll see you guys at 4pm Pacific.
[711:48.97]For the stream.
[711:52.49]And maybe afterwards I will give this another go.
[711:55.58]We'll see.
[711:57.42]On top of that, thanks everybody.
[711:58.26]There was a lot of... There was a couple of raids and hosts and everything and there were a lot of people that came out.
[712:02.99]Thank you for coming out.
[712:03.67]If you stuck around, hell yeah.
[712:05.49]Thanks for sticking around.
[712:07.39]Let's run the credits because it's gonna be crazy.
[712:11.31]And then we can get some sleep.
[712:14.29]Is it even running?
[712:15.31]Holy shit.
[712:20.73]That may be the fastest it's ever gone.
[712:28.24]I've never seen it scroll that fast.
[712:34.55]Holy shit.
[712:37.01]Have fun reading that.
[712:48.02]Yeah, good night, guys.
[712:48.94]See you in, uh, like, twelve and a half hours, whatever it is.
[713:07.88]You stayed so I could read your bits at the end.
[713:10.18]I am sad.
[713:11.46]I'm really sorry.
[713:14.48]But I am out of gas completely.
[713:16.10]I never expected I was going to play this for more than like 8 to 7 or 8 plus hours.
[713:21.61]But I gotta be honest with you guys.
[713:22.81]I'm out of gas completely.
[713:26.63]And I would not... I would rather hold on to them and do them when I have energy than like sleepy, almost potentially lazily going through them.
[713:37.51]You know what I'm saying?
[713:45.27]Did you see Cri... Yeah, actually, I did.
[713:46.89]Uh... Criken was in town.
[713:50.17]He was really, really great.
[713:52.78]He hit me up.
[713:53.36]He said, hey, I'm gonna be in Vegas.
[713:54.66]And I was like, I'll come say hello.
[714:02.22]Hung out for a little while.
[714:03.00]It was great.
[714:06.73]I came back from a pee break.
[714:07.77]Did I miss anything?
[714:08.55]Uh, well, you missed left soldier.
[714:11.43]Right soldier!
[714:12.05]Is what you missed.
[714:27.63]I coached him on gambling.
[714:31.77]Well, I pressed a button and I won money.
[714:34.77]There's not much coaching.
[714:40.61]This has got to be 500 fucking subs.
[714:49.94]Let me see.
[714:54.64]This is close to 500 subs in one day.
[714:58.50]I think that's only ever happened maybe one or two other times.
[715:05.19]How much money have I made?
[715:06.81]How much money have I made this month?
[715:08.15]How much money did I make this stream?
[715:11.84]This stream, it's gotta be at least two to three grand.
[715:13.80]Has to be.
[715:14.76]This stream.
[715:26.27]Probably just opened, like, another dozen emote slots or something.
[715:37.10]But that's gonna be it.
[715:38.24]Thank you, everybody.
[715:40.98]I honestly am floored.
[715:42.30]I can't believe.
[715:43.71]It's shocking.
[715:50.81]Just the ridiculous amount of money and support.
[715:53.42]It's absolutely ridiculous.
[715:57.72]So, I cannot wait to see you again just a little bit later today.
[716:04.66]Take care.
[716:05.26]See you soon.
[716:06.04]Get some sleep.
[716:07.28]If you stayed up all night, then glad to have you.
[716:12.43]See you guys real soon.
[716:13.71]Have a great rest of your night.
[716:14.97]Or, you know, not even night.
[716:15.87]It's not night for anybody right now.
[716:18.25]It's day for everyone now.
[716:19.53]Everybody in the world.
[716:21.13]Except for Australia.
[716:25.54]Good night, guys.
[716:51.88]I can't leave yet.
[716:52.96]I can't leave yet.
[716:54.31]I'm sorry.
[716:54.83]We're not leaving yet.
[716:58.69]It's 11.58.
[716:59.47]11 hours and 58 minutes.
[717:00.63]I can't.
[717:01.19]It's gotta be 12 hours.
[717:04.13]I'm gonna have to sit here for like another 30 seconds.
[717:05.67]So.
[717:15.87]Two minutes of madness.
[717:23.05]How's your day been, chat?
[717:25.86]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11... Is it like noon for some of you guys?
[717:29.90]A lot of the EU crowd, it's definitely somewhere between like 11 and 1, right?
[717:38.50]Have I ever done a 12-hour stream?
[717:42.92]I don't know.
[717:43.78]Have I?
[717:53.45]This is definitely the longest stream.
[717:56.93]Half of a full day.
[718:02.57]Hit and run was the longest, and that was about 11 hours.
[718:12.31]And you're last, according to your bio.
[718:14.17]Oh god.
[718:17.56]Here we go, 30 seconds.
[718:18.28]24 hours now.
[718:23.99]I just don't have it in me.
[718:24.95]I mean, you see how I'm acting after the 10-hour mark.
[718:30.89]There's no way.
[718:33.49]It's like a physically human... It's a human impossibility.
[718:40.08]You gotta be made out of, like, a machine.
[718:41.56]You have to, like, plug your brain in somewhere.
[718:44.14]I will never be able to do 24 hours.
[718:56.93]There it is.
[718:58.67]12 hours.
[719:00.43]Thanks a lot, guys.
[719:03.37]See you very soon.
[719:05.39]Sooner than I think.
[719:08.59]Good night.
[719:10.37]Good morning.
[719:10.77]Good afternoon.
