[ve:60.16.100]

[00:19.50]Can't wait.
[00:22.68]You got chat open?
[00:24.08]I don't have chat open.
[00:25.28]Yeah, cut them, cut them out.
[00:29.31]Well, I think, honestly, if you want my opinion on that, I think that 2077... No, I don't think so.
[00:58.30]I don't have one of those things under here.
[01:12.68]No, they can't.
[01:13.24]Yeah, definitely.
[01:18.66]Am I still here?
[01:21.00]Hello?
[01:24.49]Can you guys hear me?
[01:26.73]Oh, there you are.
[01:42.32]Just milk.
[01:51.51]It was nice, yeah.
[01:58.83]Yeah.
[02:00.13]I think, I mean, the whole thing with the game is it takes place in the future, so.
[02:04.39]I just want to know what kind of food they eat in the future, you know what I mean?
[02:08.23]What's happening to my fucking feed?
[02:15.85]Hey guys, how you doing?
[02:19.85]Enable what?
[02:20.27]What do you mean there's no sound?
[02:26.76]It was muted the whole fucking time?
[02:28.46]I gotta do the whole thing again.
[02:29.56]Just relax.
[02:30.76]I'm definitely hyped about it, of course.
[02:32.16]God damn it.
[02:32.78]But I'm not... I'm not at, like, co-levels or levels of fanboys that I could be.
[02:40.08]That I am for, say, Bloodlines 2.
[02:42.51]Like, I'm really excited to see more Bloodlines 2.
[02:44.09]So am I. I can't wait.
[02:46.47]Devolver Conference, I'm super hyped about that.
[02:49.25]But, like, as far as the Cyberpunk shit, I'm...
[02:51.47]I'm on an even keel for that stuff.
[02:53.55]Can we swear here?
[02:53.97]Yeah, yeah.
[02:54.97]Let's talk about some of the other stuff that we'll see outside of third party.
[02:58.23]Let's talk first party for a second.
[02:59.55]Halo Infinite.
[03:01.12]I don't think... Rami, are you a big Halo fan?
[03:03.38]Where are you at with the Halo?
[03:04.22]I'm a big... I'm a Halo fan.
[03:05.26]I can tell you about it.
[03:07.02]I'm not... You know, I want to be excited about Halo again.
[03:11.58]I haven't been in a while.
[03:12.70]Like, ODST and Reach were sort of like where it ended for me.
[03:16.92]And even though I really respect Halo 4...
[03:20.87]Um, and you know, like in the halos that have come after have just not, they haven't mentioned, they haven't managed to capture that, that feeling that I had with the, like, obviously I've been playing destiny a lot and a lot of my love for halo is in destiny, but I really hope that halo finds a new identity, right?
[03:41.38]A new, like, this is halo instead of trying to kind of be old halo and kind of be not.
[03:46.84]And I just, I'm just, I want to be excited about Halo.
[03:50.00]Please give me something to be excited about.
[03:51.54]That's really what I want.
[03:52.69]All right.
[03:52.97]Does this excite you?
[03:54.23]Does a FPS's 2019 BR, does a Halo BR?
[03:59.15]No, no, no BR.
[04:00.61]BR doesn't excite me at all.
[04:02.02]Sorry, I'm interrupting you, but.
[04:03.30]Is BR out the window now?
[04:04.72]Yes, I think so.
[04:05.14]Do they just go back to what Halo was?
[04:06.54]I think BR is just a thing that was like League of Legends before.
[04:08.76]I don't, I don't.
[04:09.64]I really don't care too much.
[04:11.10]I do.
[04:11.42]I know this.
[04:11.96]I know this.
[04:12.30]Let me answer it.
[04:12.80]I know this.
[04:14.59]I can see it, but I also don't really need it.
[04:17.03]Chat's definitely not in the VR world as well.
[04:19.07]So I think that... It's honestly, for me, Halo was always about like tight little shootouts, quarters, throwing grenades, weird physics bugs, like throwing a warthog over somebody's head with a grenade.
[04:30.23]Like that's Halo for me.
[04:31.61]Right.
[04:31.79]I don't really need that 100 people.
[04:32.61]Yeah.
[04:32.73]Yeah.
[04:32.83]What were you going to say before I interrupted you?
[04:38.83]You interrupted me.
[04:39.99]I was going to say something about BR.
[04:41.13]Yeah, now I remember.
[04:43.35]Thank you.
[04:44.40]So basically, it's an interesting situation because with Halo, it's kind of like a Borderlands thing where it's such an established franchise.
[04:51.44]You're going to have a fan base, a broad fan base in Halo's situation where they're going to be expecting kind of the same thing.
[04:57.57]They want more of what they already love.
[04:59.85]So it's a very fine line to walk when making a subsequent...
[05:03.87]I'm always blocking the name.
[05:05.11]Oh, sorry.
[05:05.61]Where it's kind of like, how much new stuff can you really put in without alienating that already established, very established in Halo's case?
[05:11.40]Just like we had a presidential debate.
[05:13.00]Interesting.
[05:13.85]Just because I'm like 2% of the poll doesn't mean I get to say anything.
[05:17.04]We talked about Fable on our pre-show.
[05:19.48]Are we, do we think that's, I mean, it was listed in the Mixer game directory, also the Twitch game directory.
[05:24.10]That's what everyone's thinking it's going to be here.
[05:26.28]Is it time for a new Fable?
[05:27.78]Is it time to put that game back out there?
[05:29.92]Fable 3, I think.
[05:31.62]I mean, is it time for a good new RPG is the bigger question.
[05:35.76]If you frame it that way, I think so.
[05:37.11]Yeah.
[05:38.13]Yeah.
[05:38.39]Come on.
[05:38.85]It's about time.
[05:40.59]What has been like the big like RPG
[05:44.09]It's been what?
[05:44.61]The Witcher 3 was like the last like really big one that kind of made me feel like, oh wow, here's a big old fantasy RPG.
[05:50.67]Like all... No, no, no.
[05:52.05]What do you think?
[05:52.45]Apart from CRPGs, yeah.
[05:53.86]It's been kind of... Well, that type of RPG, right?
[05:56.44]Yeah.
[05:56.56]Yeah, yeah.
[05:57.38]Mike!
[05:57.66]Hey, all right.
[05:58.38]I'm done with this.
[05:59.30]Top-down role-playing games.
[06:00.44]It's been a lot, but like... Stop the screen for a second.
[06:03.04]Welcome.
[06:03.82]That was a long... How long have I been streaming?
[06:05.78]Like six minutes?
[06:06.45]I feel like I've been streaming for like four hours already.
[06:09.03]Is that weird?
[06:12.56]Oh, you missed the beginning, too.
[06:13.84]I feel so fucking bad about that.
[06:17.08]Everyone got silent, and I said, like, hey, why do I not have one of those things?
[06:20.55]And they were like, somebody coughed?
[06:21.63]I can't believe it.
[06:22.13]I'm so pissed that it was muted.
[06:23.81]Anyways, hello.
[06:25.27]We're going to watch the Microsoft E3 conference today.
[06:29.14]I made sure to get nice villain hair for you guys.
[06:32.08]I know you like the villain hair.
[06:33.60]I did it specifically.
[06:38.12]You just finished what?
[06:42.20]How tall am I?
[06:42.86]Why is my hair receding?
[06:47.31]Let me get back to the fucking cast.
[06:54.25]This actually looks kind of fun.
[07:03.19]This is my show now.
[07:07.14]um by the time it gets to e3 obviously you have a good idea of what it is but some of the games you're going to see today have absurd history stories like just ridiculous stories of deals development problems uh just that kind of stuff makes me excited it excites me too to celebrate
[07:26.17]The developers that have worked so hard to bring this... They work so damn hard, you know.
[07:30.06]They really do.
[07:30.70]Sorry, I'm like a huge person.
[07:32.32]I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this.
[07:33.44]That's why I need so much screen real estate.
[07:34.98]I'm eight and a half feet tall.
[07:36.74]There's no webcam.
[07:38.04]These are four webcams attached in squares I've edited out the middle.
[07:41.70]Because Cyberpunk's already there, so that's kind of... Is it... It is already there, you're right, yeah.
[07:45.19]Showing Halo off?
[07:46.63]Or the new console off?
[07:47.67]Like, what's the big... What's the big thing that everyone's going to be talking about?
[07:52.61]If they have the console, it's going to be the console.
[07:54.60]You think?
[07:55.22]Like Sony seems convinced that it's the console because they've been talking about theirs.
[08:00.09]They clearly want to be ahead.
[08:02.05]So... Yeah.
[08:04.17]I guess we'll see.
[08:05.19]Zeke, what about you?
[08:06.13]Are you all in on the indie stuff?
[08:07.68]Is there any one particular thing here that you're super excited about with the potential to see?
[08:12.08]Because we're about five minutes away, six minutes away.
[08:14.78]What do you think?
[08:15.22]Well, like, last time you cut my legs out before I even had a chance, you were like, and you can't say new IPs because that's always what I'm looking for.
[08:23.63]That's bullshit.
[08:24.21]You should be like that.
[08:25.19]New intellectual property.
[08:26.18]I can't wait for the new console, by the way.
[08:27.70]To be shown there, whether they're indie or otherwise.
[08:30.82]But, I mean, if you're going for, like, a long shot outside chance, like...
[08:36.23]Man, Skate 4 would be fucking cool.
[08:38.43]Oh!
[08:39.25]Well, I would love to not have that released because I hated this third one so much.
[08:42.93]That would be pretty sweet.
[08:43.98]Did you happen to see, uh, I think it was, I didn't, maybe Rami read this fully, but Adam Sessler works for, like, a data company when it comes to what people are excited about, and I think Skate 4 was the number one mentioned thing yesterday during all of, like, social media and chat across all their different platforms.
[08:58.83]During the EA, or the, not conference, the EA Play, sorry, I'll stay on brand, Skate 4 was mentioned more times than anything they showed.
[09:05.89]Very, very important.
[09:06.89]Which is kind of funny.
[09:08.59]I'm drinking fermented milk.
[09:10.37]If you saw that, it was very interesting.
[09:14.03]I look like a dream person.
[09:16.23]Do I look fucking fucked up right now?
[09:18.74]Look at this.
[09:20.26]What's wrong with my face?
[09:21.72]I'm having a mental breakdown.
[09:25.58]That was pretty hard, man.
[09:27.18]Because, like, basically, Anthem had... Look at me.
[09:29.84]Anthem came out.
[09:31.30]I look like a fucking snake person.
[09:33.56]Do I look fucking strange or am I?
[09:35.60]What's wrong with me?
[09:36.28]I can't even drink this.
[09:54.82]Wow, aren't we awesome listening to our people?
[09:56.94]It's kind of like... Yeah.
[09:59.84]Anyways, that's Anthony.
[10:00.73]We'll be talking about that on our recap.
[10:02.49]And anyway, I think that it's time for me to talk.
[10:05.05]Do you think they give any love to the PC side of Xbox here?
[10:08.69]Do you think they devote any time to it?
[10:10.47]No, they never do.
[10:11.05]Joe, they never do, Joe.
[10:11.90]I think it's $10.
[10:12.38]One of them being Metro Exodus.
[10:18.70]They're going to come up with a companion app for Dead Rising 4 that lets you check the map where a treasure could be.
[10:32.67]I mean, it's been their strategy for years now, right?
[10:35.09]They want to blur that line.
[10:36.39]They want to make you forget that Xbox and PC are different things.
[10:40.01]I didn't even tweet this.
[10:42.15]They're in the perfect position to do it.
[10:44.71]You know, owning Windows.
[10:45.98]They're consolidating the stores.
[10:47.98]It's going to be the Xbox store and PC as well.
[10:49.98]Like, yeah, they're obviously trying to make this one thing.
[10:52.30]So I don't think we'll see anything specifically for PC.
[10:55.52]But, oh, yeah, they're going to mention PC, like, all night.
[10:59.24]I don't know if they will.
[11:00.34]I don't think they're gonna.
[11:01.28]That's true.
[11:01.66]We'll be done in 20 minutes.
[11:02.60]It's just Gamefly.
[11:03.10]Joe, it's Gamefly.
[11:24.33]Gamefly was way before its time.
[11:25.75]Something they should definitely be pushing a little bit.
[11:28.14]They were the first company that ever thought that was a decent idea.
[11:30.76]And they stole it from them.
[11:32.48]They will.
[11:33.56]What do you think is the opener?
[11:35.90]Do you open or close with the new console?
[11:38.56]Do you open or close with Halo?
[11:40.38]Oh, you close with the new console.
[11:42.40]Last thing you do is you say, and one more thing.
[11:45.21]And you walk off stage and the trailer plays behind you.
[11:46.93]It's going to be in the first few minutes.
[11:48.93]And they're going to start off with a game that shows off what it can do.
[11:55.26]It's going to be one image, too.
[11:56.54]Joe, it's going to be one image.
[11:58.22]That's it.
[12:00.54]Real quick, by the way, apparently it's $1 during the beta phase.
[12:04.62]Am I allowed to do this?
[12:05.86]Jesus.
[12:06.88]They are trying to get some early adoption rate going on.
[12:10.00]Blind.
[12:10.40]What do you mean?
[12:11.48]That seems kind of, okay.
[12:13.84]Anyway, what was the question again?
[12:15.90]What are they going to open?
[12:16.74]Are they going to be doing this?
[12:17.66]In a minute 40, a minute 30.
[12:19.42]Probably the standard.
[12:21.04]I'm like pretending to be on their podcast.
[12:24.04]I'm not on their podcast right now, I'm just drinking milk.
[12:39.04]Look at this, look at how bad my hair looks from this-
[12:42.04]I'm not even going to show you, who cares? Like alright, I look like stretched out man.
[12:52.89]Ignoring the bingo.
[12:54.07]Is it bingo?
[12:55.95]Like a surprise like that no one that might not have gotten leaked.
[12:59.35]I want to do bingo, but it's too much to pay attention to.
[13:01.15]Exactly, exactly.
[13:02.03]They're going to open with like, hey, Xbox dildo coming right at you.
[13:06.30]It's like, whoa, what?
[13:08.68]that would say that on tv they've taken the timer off uh for everyone that's over at twitch I think we're gonna get shut up over there oh I'm ready to join us we're gonna be talking over the conference here at twitch.tv and we'll be back after go stay here stay on my stream here any second I'm gonna go ahead and kick it over bingo bingo bingo I don't have enough time to do a bingo
[13:31.32]What the fuck is this bingo card?
[13:33.86]Hold on.
[13:34.96]Annoying.
[13:36.34]Jerma hyped for From Software.
[13:38.31]Minecraft.
[13:39.57]Jerma's a sellout because he likes something.
[13:42.03]I don't even have things set up for this.
[13:43.57]Oh my god.
[13:44.61]And my screen just went down.
[13:45.93]Fuck it, Mike.
[13:46.55]Windows 10.

[14:36.28]They left me, they left me, they left me.
[14:41.22]No, this is right.
[14:49.73]This is like turned up all the way.
[14:52.26]Am I gonna be bigger than this?
[14:53.12]Oh, this is my favorite part before a Marvel movie!
[14:56.52]When it shows everything, it says Marvel!
[15:17.55]I bet they show fourths of twelve.
[15:21.70]Xbox Game Studios.
[15:23.64]Please welcome.
[15:35.08]The corporate model is the oldest and most efficient structure history has ever shown us.
[15:42.71]Scheduled scarcity is a premium feature of colonial life.
[15:47.14]The colony must never lose faith.
[15:49.04]That is what the board provides.
[15:50.62]Security in a senseless and chaotic world.
[15:56.02]This is Halcyon, the furthest colony in the galaxy.
[16:00.17]Proudly owned and operated by corporations.
[16:04.41]Everything we have, everything we are, we owe to them.
[16:10.19]He's here?
[16:12.69]Alright, this is the outer... the outside, whatever it's called.
[16:14.89]Someone who's challenging the corporate war.
[16:16.59]Someone who's digging up their secrets.
[16:39.14]Someone who could be a villain.
[16:44.36]Or a hero.
[16:45.46]Looks like the bleeding stopped.
[16:47.28]I owe you one.
[16:48.12]Here, hope this gun serves you better than it did me.
[16:52.00]Or a psychopath.
[16:53.82]Did you ever think you'd end up like this?
[17:00.59]My time to shine!
[17:06.52]Classic Jerva joke.
[17:08.20]Yeah, this is the outer, what's it, whatever it's called.
[17:09.42]Yeah, see, I told you.
[17:09.88]You know what I'm talking about.
[17:40.50]Outer Worlds.
[17:42.98]Alright.
[17:51.31]I took pregnancy classes just for this moment.
[17:53.39]Come on, Phil.
[17:56.56]No.
[17:56.74]Let's see what they have to say.
[18:09.84]God, I wish I was in that audience right now, screaming.
[18:13.37]At E3 2018, we announced that Ninja Theory had joined Xbox Game Studios, a move that has given us an incredible boost in achieving the creative ambition of our teams.
[18:24.35]We've started work on a number of new games at the studio, and in the near future, we'll be sharing details on all of these projects.
[18:31.81]I need a fucking coffee so bad.
[18:33.19]When we joined Xbox Game Studios, we already had a very exciting game several years in the making.
[18:39.96]Oh.
[18:40.04]And we're happy to return to E3 to share this with you.
[18:45.04]As creative director, I'm stoked to be here to share our new game with you guys.
[18:50.34]It combines two of my gaming passions, third-person action combat and competitive team multiplayer.
[18:57.55]Our technical alpha is kicking off in just a couple of weeks.
[19:00.57]And card games.
[19:02.09]Get involved and tell us what you think.
[19:04.59]Or if you're here at E3, come and join us for a game.
[19:07.91]It's my two favorite things, card games and microtransactions.
[19:11.83]This is Bleeding Edge.
[19:13.57]It's my favorite thing.
[19:19.12]Alright, alright, I'll shut up!
[19:26.56]Out, it's the... Outer Worlds!
[19:29.44]It's the Outer Worlds!
[19:32.86]Oh, they're showing more Outer Worlds.
[19:35.04]Nice.
[19:57.38]Did that wave just turn into a motorcycle?
[20:24.43]Technical alpha starts on June 27th Technical alpha I'm not sure you'd want to you want to death we're getting earlier and earlier with when you start to let people play your game Does that mean that there's like sounds?
[20:45.68]There's no sounds in that game
[21:23.20]Did they show this last year?
[21:24.24]I feel like they did.
[21:25.03]The Game Awards or something?
[22:24.85]Big three in a row, oh my god.
[22:26.99]I'll see you in a minute.
[22:42.97]Minecraft version 2.12?
[22:47.29]This captain the game now.
[22:53.52]What is this?
[22:59.77]This is a pretty big update for Minecraft.
[23:01.33]Is this Diablo Immortal?
[23:07.45]Is this Minecraft Diablo?
[23:09.23]This is gonna sell like fucking trillion copies, you know it.
[23:36.57]Well, you know, it's really sad when probably the best action RPG to come out in probably two or three plus years is Minecraft spin-off.
[23:53.84]I'm excited for that.
[23:54.60]That sucks.
[23:55.60]I'm excited for that.
[23:56.51]I am.
[23:57.27]I want to play that.
[23:58.23]I don't even like Minecraft.
[24:01.71]Here he is.
[24:03.07]I'm excited for that.
[24:03.83]I actually am.
[24:04.51]I think that'll be fun to play for like an hour.
[24:07.31]Here he is.
[24:09.27]Come on.

[26:36.95]And with new technological leaps, we get to play whatever we want with whomever we want and wherever we want.
[26:46.47]Yeah, Mom, you can't tell me when I can't.
[26:48.45]I can't play my game now.
[26:49.65]You can't tell me what to do, Mom.
[26:51.91]Every decision is guided by our belief that gaming is for everyone.

[28:08.28]How long is this broadcast?
[28:10.93]We get 60.
[28:13.05]Yeah, we decided to not have anything to show you for the last four years.
[28:17.93]We thought 2019 was the time to do it.
[28:21.97]What's next at Xbox Game Studios?
[28:30.52]And of course, revealing more about our next new console.

[37:13.43]What a legend.
[37:14.75]All right.
[37:15.75]It's like having Picasso on stage.
[37:17.19]I'm going to talk to you about something.
[37:19.79]I mean, I'm going to talk to you about something.
[37:25.46]CD Projekt Red.
[37:29.48]Why is he acting like Christopher Walken?
[37:31.28]Cyberpunk 2077.
[37:32.35]I gotta tell you.
[37:36.03]Cyberpunk 77.
[37:38.27]He's being like Walken.
[37:39.17]The guys from CD Projekt Red approached me and asked me to be a part of their new project.
[37:44.90]Cyberpunk 2077.
[37:49.46]They were going on and on about how they'd create this vast open world with a branching storyline, how you'd be able to customize your character through in-game choices.
[38:00.88]And it's not something I knew before, but I was excited by.
[38:03.84]And I'm always drawn to fascinating stories.
[38:07.47]I mean, this is cool.
[38:11.21]I'm going to get on stage with John.
[38:16.10]is set in a metropolis of the future where body modification has become an obsession.
[38:22.82]Play as an outlaw, an enhanced mercenary working in the sleazy underbelly of the city.
[38:30.61]Yeah.
[38:31.75]Yeah.
[38:34.67]Okay, let me tell you.
[38:37.47]The feeling of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking.
[38:48.14]You're breathtaking.
[38:50.62]You're all breathtaking.
[38:53.88]I'm trying.
[38:54.48]All right, all right, all right.
[38:56.50]So I got to finish this.
[38:57.42]So tell me, do you guys want to know when there's the release date?
[39:08.35]I think a lot of people do.
[39:10.35]All right.
[39:10.85]Be nice.
[39:11.97]Then check this out.
[39:19.65]That's really cool though.
[39:22.06]It's going to be a pretty fun money management sim game.
[39:50.29]They got you guys all fucking jacked up of it being this crazy action game.
[39:53.59]Now it's gonna be like a banking simulator.
[39:55.63]That's a long way away, but at least we have a day.
[40:04.22]This fucking Keanu Reeves was just on the stage.
[40:06.32]Like, that's unbelievable.
[40:09.48]Keanu Reeves is in this one too.
[40:22.11]Build Mine Sell Hug Cook Fail at Super Mario 2 Radishes

[41:01.07]So you play like a germ.
[41:04.55]And I'm not talking about you guys, you know, I'm one of the germamites, one of the germs.
[41:17.38]Once upon a shooting star.
[41:19.20]Oh, Spiritfarer.
[41:29.76]They really have like a hundred games.
[41:31.00]Alright.
[41:39.11]This better be fucking good because I've been waiting a long time for this shit.
[42:39.95]I'm not excited for it.
[42:48.92]It looks alright, it's just I don't like that kind of 2D style for a game like that.
[42:54.88]It's alright.
[42:56.72]I'm not excited for it, but it might be okay.
[43:16.73]This looks pretty cool.
[43:21.02]Look at how cool this looks!
[43:25.80]This is the best game they've shown so far.
[43:31.09]I can't even remember what they showed.
[43:46.16]I can't even... I don't even know what that says.
[43:49.37]Rip... Pig... I don't know what that said.
[43:53.12]That's not a good marketing technique because I don't know what the fuck your name of the game is.
[43:56.53]Egg Time?
[44:34.29]Oh, you're talking about them.
[44:38.32]What was that one?
[45:07.08]Supermarket Tree.
[45:13.63]Lord of the Rings card game.
[45:15.09]I mean, these are all just gonna get dumped on Xbox Live.
[45:33.22]Wow, that was all one game.
[45:34.20]Interesting.
[45:37.12]What did I do with my camera?
[45:39.22]Please welcome Head of Xbox Partnerships, Sarah Vaughn.
[45:45.29]All right, here we go.
[45:47.59]Let's get some, like, a big announcement here.
[45:50.75]Very large announcement.
[45:53.91]All the ID at Xbox games you just saw will premiere on Xbox Game Pass day one.
[46:00.88]Today.
[46:01.66]Oh.
[46:06.00]At Xbox, our passion is to help you find and play the games that you love through creation, curation, and discovery.
[46:15.43]The ultimate expression of that passion is Xbox Game Pass.
[46:20.51]My team travels the globe seeking out fan favorites and hidden gems and craft partnerships with their creators so that you can discover your next favorite game.
[46:33.63]mind-blowing experiences, epic adventures, and iconic characters, all for you to explore.
[46:41.50]It has been awesome to see the record-breaking success developers have had in Xbox Game Pass, introducing their games to new players and creating lifelong fans.
[46:53.93]Since launch, we have tripled the number of partners in Game Pass,
[46:57.85]adding more games from more genres, platformers, RPG, adventure, sports, puzzles, and more every single month.
[47:06.17]And of course, every Xbox Game Studios title you see today will premiere in Game Pass day one.
[47:13.20]I mean, it's...
[47:19.69]We are thrilled to announce new titles coming to Xbox Game Pass on console today, including Batman Arkham Knight, Metro Exodus, Hollow Knight, and Borderlands The Handsome Collection.
[47:38.60]I mean, Microsoft has to do something.
[47:41.62]They have to do something different.
[47:43.08]Amazing games that you can start playing today.
[47:45.94]Something that Sony's not doing, because Sony's crushing them every single week.
[47:50.08]Nintendo and Sony are crushing it.
[47:51.74]Like they're being crushed.
[47:53.21]They gotta come up with something.
[47:54.65]Any game with anyone, anywhere.
[47:57.95]And we know for many of you that means PC.
[48:01.77]That is why... Okay, I'm listening.
[48:04.32]Last month, we announced Xbox Game Pass for PC.
[48:11.33]I swear to God, I thought about it for a second.
[48:13.65]I was going to dump the coffee on me.
[48:15.11]Today, the Game Pass journey on PC begins.
[48:18.93]That would be really dumb.
[48:19.97]That would be a really stupid thing to do.
[48:23.23]PC players can discover their next favorite game with Xbox Game Pass.
[48:27.93]We have curated over 100 games just for PC, including favorites like Imperator Rome and Football Manager 2019.
[48:36.47]Can't you already play these?
[48:39.95]Like, why do I need an Xbox Game Pass if I already own, like, everybody already owns these.
[48:43.65]And for the first time on PC, starting with Halo Reach, the entire Master Chief collection.
[48:50.30]Yeah, but we all knew that was coming.
[48:55.38]There's Banjo-Kazooie 3 on PC only.
[48:59.60]We are thrilled to share that Xbox Game Pass for PC launches in open beta today.
[49:09.13]Let's go get it.
[49:12.59]Today.
[49:13.19]Are you guys ready to play a bunch of games that you've probably already played?
[49:24.44]It's like a Steam sale, but like... Those of you guys... I can't speak because it's too loud in my ear.
[49:34.80]If you haven't played these games, you can spend, like, $2 to buy, you know, the game that you, like, Ark.
[49:40.84]Alright, if you haven't played Ark yet.
[49:45.50]Yeah, yeah, Prey, that was a game that you could get on Steam sale for, like, $4.
[49:50.78]Wolfenstein 2, get that one for, like, $6 in, like, a month or two.
[49:55.80]Tomb Raider.
[49:57.22]These are all, this is Steam sale.
[49:59.01]This is Xbox Steam sale.
[50:06.04]But it's... But it is cool though.
[50:08.28]It is.
[50:09.82]At least they're trying something different.
[50:12.30]Because they're gonna start to do this.
[50:14.54]And they're not... Xbox ain't gonna fucking sell games anymore.
[50:17.55]Like in five years.
[50:18.35]It's gonna be a subscription.
[50:20.11]Like Netflix.
[50:21.09]It'll be like an Xbox Netflix.
[50:22.97]And... If you want it all...
[50:30.42]We have created a membership just for you.
[50:33.60]What is it?
[50:33.92]Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[50:36.24]Uh-oh, what does that mean?
[50:37.52]What's the difference?
[50:38.34]Why do you have two?
[50:39.18]Wait, why are there two?
[50:40.42]Why do you have two?
[50:42.35]You get everything.
[50:44.25]Xbox Game Pass for console with over 100 great games.
[50:47.47]Uh-huh.
[50:48.01]Xbox Live Gold and unrivaled gaming community.
[50:51.29]And now, Xbox Game Pass for PC at no additional charge.
[50:59.40]All right.
[51:00.67]That's $15.
[51:03.35]If it was like $20 or $30, I might have been a little skeptical on that one.
[51:14.88]That's just to get you to sign up, but then you have to put your credit card in.
[51:19.17]They're doing the gym.
[51:20.79]Xbox is going to win the next console in the world.
[51:22.77]They're doing the gym fucking pass.
[51:24.07]You know you're going to buy that for $1, and you're going to forget about it, and it's going to charge you every month, and you're going to forget you have it.
[51:28.43]What a perfect, what an unbelievable strategy.
[51:31.42]The you don't go to the gym strategy.
[51:37.93]It's only $5 to sign up and then it's 20 a month.
[51:59.16]Flight simulator?
[52:03.18]Somebody said Google Earth 4.
[52:04.52]What was the last flight simulator they actually came out with?
[52:15.77]Yeah, this is a big deal to a lot of people.
[52:27.40]Now, Flight Simulator has a really, really dedicated, huge community.
[52:34.23]I'm telling you, there are people that are freaking out right now that are so happy to see this.
[52:41.20]I'm glad.
[52:41.88]Hopefully it's good.
[53:00.80]Yeah.
[53:04.00]You might think that's boring, but that's a big deal to a ton of people.
[53:15.11]Do you remember a time when armies were built and powerful cities collapsed?
[53:24.42]when the smallest of choices echoed through the pages of history.
[53:30.20]I wasn't alive.
[53:31.04]It was an age of empires.
[53:35.22]One of the most played strategy games ever in 4K.
[53:45.69]This is the moment where the guy was on the plane, right?
[53:52.42]Remember I told the story?
[53:53.18]This is the one where I was watching the guy play it on the plane?
[53:54.84]This is Age of Kings, right?
[54:07.42]Which one's Age of King?
[54:10.99]That wasn't Clash of Clans, I was like fucking 14.
[54:16.36]Razors?
[54:17.62]I see you at donkey's age.
[54:19.76]Welcome to beautiful Colorado.

[54:36.97]Sample home-cooked delicacies.
[54:39.35]Eat where the locals eat.
[54:42.79]Visit Colorado Springs.
[54:48.41]There's so much to see and do in this post-apocalyptic winter wonderland.
[54:56.32]Be new people.
[54:58.50]Make new friends.
[55:00.52]Colorado has colorful characters and friendly faces everywhere you look.
[55:07.92]See our beautiful airport.
[55:11.38]And don't forget to pick yourself up a nifty souvenir.

[55:23.36]First round's on you.
[55:24.68]Oh, Wasteland, okay.
[55:26.50]Wasteland?
[55:27.12]What do you got for us?
[55:48.06]Games are at the heart of our mission.
[55:50.44]All last year we added seven new game development studios to Xbox.
[55:59.26]It's fantastic to see some of these studios already sharing new games on our E3 stage, and there's more to come.
[56:07.75]I have the privilege of working with some of the best studios around the globe, and for me, great studios are about people, teams, and ideas.
[56:18.48]Our success comes down to one thing, creating great games that players love.
[56:24.99]And great games come from great developers.
[56:29.41]That's why I'm honored today to announce that joining Xbox Studios is Double Fine Productions.
[56:48.56]Double Fine has been a beacon of creativity and spirit in game development for almost 20 years with classic games like Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, and Broken Age.
[57:01.07]I'm looking forward to Double Fine joining Xbox and seeing what we create together.
[57:07.43]Please join me in welcoming the founder and president of Double Fine Productions, Tim Schafer.
[57:15.38]Psychonauts might be fun, Psychonauts 2, but, like, Broken Age was their big comeback kind of game there, and I thought it was kind of disappointing.
[57:28.35]Hello.
[57:29.79]Thank you.
[57:31.13]Thank you so much, and thank you, Matt.
[57:33.07]We are so excited to be joining Xbox Game Studios, and I'm here to personally reassure you, Matt, I don't know what you've heard, but I'm a team player.
[57:40.02]Whatever you need from Double Final to make the Halo stuff...
[57:45.22]Forza stuff, Excel stuff, whatever you want, we are there.
[57:49.50]Tim, we just want you to make great games.
[57:57.28]Why don't they just get closer?
[57:59.86]Why are you talking this far away from each other?
[58:03.58]They're having like a general conversation, like fucking 60 feet away.
[58:08.93]Just like stand in the middle together.
[58:11.28]That was so weird because it was like, oh hey, so what do you think about this?
[58:14.04]Guy fucking a football field away?
[58:15.80]Alright, I gotta shut up.
[58:20.18]My name is Raz.
[58:22.76]And today is my first official day on the job.
[58:29.31]We're on a mission.
[58:30.75]Rasputin?
[58:31.55]I'm on him.
[58:32.63]Looking for me?
[58:50.49]Mia, the mission is falling apart.
[58:52.43]We've lost control of Lobato.
[58:54.18]I put the old egg in the box and the basket in the basket.
[58:57.94]No, no!
[58:59.36]I won't tell.
[59:00.36]I won't tell anyone.
[59:01.74]I promise.
[59:03.43]No, please!
[59:16.68]Psychonauts 2, back into the domain.
[59:20.24]No tagline, okay.
[59:21.56]No, no, um... World premiere.
[59:24.44]No colon?
[59:39.79]That's a lego.
[59:43.73]Every fucking star, I mean, this is like...
[59:47.90]Did you hear the music?
[59:50.12]Did you hear the lightsaber sounds?
[59:51.74]I feel like I hear this in my fucking sleep.
[59:54.15]I gotta tell you about a dream I had.
[59:56.03]It's crazy.
[59:56.69]Nothing to do with Star Wars or E3.
[59:58.93]I'll wait till the presentation's over to tell you.
[60:00.77]Wait, what do you mean shut up?
[60:11.68]Shut up?
[60:15.31]It's Lego Star Wars!
[60:16.65]Is it that big of a deal?
[60:18.46]Should I be quiet?
[60:23.97]Yes.
[60:42.13]Is this Dragon Ball Z Full Fighter First Extreme 4?
[61:08.00]Stop it, Freezer!
[61:11.70]Stop it, Freezer!
[61:24.89]Take this, Saiyajin!
[61:26.71]Freezer!
[61:27.88]Don't mess with me!
[61:32.38]Alright, if it's over 10 syllables, I win.
[61:43.49]Dragon Ball Game... Hold on.
[61:45.75]Dragon Ball Game Project Z. What's underneath it?
[61:53.38]There was something underneath it, too.
[61:56.86]World Premiere.
[62:16.33]I have a surprise for you.
[62:18.01]Okay.
[62:23.65]You want to guess what it is?
[62:26.57]This is an outfit for a newborn.
[62:28.69]You bought it this morning.
[62:30.17]You wanted to surprise me.
[62:31.87]I'm sorry.
[62:32.27]You're pregnant.
[62:34.48]You know?
[62:35.02]I know because you already gave it to me.
[62:40.16]This has happened before.
[62:42.56]What are you talking about?
[62:44.36]What's going on?
[62:45.40]Someone is coming.
[62:46.60]He's going to hurt us.
[62:47.66]He says you killed your father.
[62:50.37]I need to know what happened.
[62:54.01]Why are you doing this?
[62:56.25]My father died... Died of a heart attack?
[62:57.86]No.
[63:00.74]I didn't have anything to do with...
[63:03.60]Any second now, he's gonna knock on that door.
[63:06.08]Help me.
[63:06.72]This isn't happening.
[63:08.22]This can't be happening.
[63:10.34]Police!
[63:11.16]Open up!
[63:12.20]That's him.
[63:13.36]Did you call the police?
[63:15.48]We have a warrant.
[63:16.33]Please open the door.
[63:18.31]I didn't do anything!
[63:19.65]We're here to help.
[63:20.89]Don't listen to him.
[63:21.59]What?
[63:22.69]I'm your only chance.
[63:26.21]what you know me I love you you have to believe me stop no under arrest you're home what are you doing are you okay
[63:53.39]This is what it's like to be a Hitman NPC.
[63:56.65]Holy shit, they're really going meta with this.
[63:59.07]I don't understand... He keeps reloading the same level!
[64:05.82]And he keeps coming and killing us!
[64:07.14]You gotta help me!
[64:17.15]He thinks it's really funny to, like, throw shit at our heads!
[64:19.91]Like, rocks and shovels!
[64:37.64]The lights will guide you.
[64:38.96]Bambi.
[64:44.28]Oh, look, it's eating!
[64:53.88]Mmm!
[64:54.25]What's in here?
[64:54.81]Let's go.
[65:14.79]I want a treat.
[65:16.09]Yeah, you can have a treat.
[65:17.03]Here, take it.
[65:20.14]We're losing him.
[65:38.52]I'm already gone.
[65:44.36]I don't know who that is.
[65:45.00]I don't know what to cheer for.
[65:47.60]I don't know what this is.
[65:48.30]Is this Gears of War?
[66:16.28]Are these all the people she's like consumed?
[66:20.70]Are these all the souls that she's consumed or something?
[66:23.53]I don't know what this is.
[66:54.01]I might have an unpopular opinion about Gears, but Gears to me is one of those like TV shows that had like the first or second amazing season and then they were like we're just gonna keep this going.
[67:10.31]It's like you came out with, you came out with like Westworld.
[67:15.43]And then, holy shit, this was awesome.
[67:16.97]And then you decided that Worst World 2 and 3 were going to come out.
[67:19.45]And it's like, whoa, what are you doing here?
[67:22.37]Thanks, everyone.
[67:23.53]We're excited to announce that Gears 5 is releasing on September 10th.
[67:30.53]I didn't even know there was a Gears 4.
[67:31.55]I swear to God, I didn't know that.
[67:32.65]And if you want to play four days early, you can with our Ultimate Edition or membership in the newly announced Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[67:42.38]It's fun, right?
[67:42.96]It's like third-person multiplayer.
[67:44.52]I remember Gears 3 was fun, right?
[67:45.28]With Gears 4, we wanted to earn your trust.
[67:47.34]But with Gears 5, we want to push the envelope by doing new things never seen in a Gears game before.
[67:52.12]And we'll tell you all about it this summer.
[67:55.02]In July, join us for our Versus Multiplayer Tech Test, where you'll be one of the first to play our all-new competitive game type, Arcade.
[68:04.00]In August, at Gamescom, go hands-on with the all-new Horde mode and see how character abilities can turn the tide on the battlefield.
[68:12.50]But they really are just seasons now.
[68:13.60]In September, we return to the Biggest Gears campaign ever, where we'll explore more of Kate's harrowing journey and celebrate our launch on September 10th.
[68:22.65]But what are we talking about today?
[68:24.77]Today, it's a brand new way to fight the swarm.
[68:28.64]In escape, you play as one of three hive busters.
[68:31.32]Why do I need to be here?
[68:31.86]You and your squad infiltrate the hive, plant the bomb, and escape with your life.
[68:37.12]Because we all know the best defense is a good offense.
[68:40.28]It's everything you love about Gears turned up to 11.
[68:44.49]No, actually, the best offense is a good defense with thorns.
[68:47.11]Get your RPG right.
[68:51.41]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[68:52.47]You did it too early!
[68:55.07]Oh!
[68:58.36]Holy shit!
[68:59.56]He was probably shitting his pants up there.
[69:01.56]Like, please don't press the fucking button early!
[69:04.34]Please don't press the button early!
[69:06.30]Dude, somebody in the front row got, like, their eyebrows singed off.
[69:24.29]That's like a- What the- Ah!
[69:29.72]Are we under the stage?
[69:30.74]What the hell is this?
[70:01.82]Deer six.
[70:02.82]That's right.
[70:03.34]We're doing both back to back.
[70:05.98]Two months apart.
[70:16.95]Skate four.
[70:42.59]Ozzy Osbourne.
[70:49.59]And then gorillas.
[71:21.21]Does anybody else feel like we're... It's hard to differentiate video games now.
[71:41.48]Am I getting old or is it just like... Are we just seeing like the same five video games made?
[71:47.52]Like for the last three or four years.
[72:10.44]I hope you enjoyed your time to escape, had an aggressive 3 player co-op experience, perfect for your living room couch.
[72:21.84]But it's not just about bussiness, you don't know to, and challenge your friends with the experiences you create.
[72:28.64]And tonight, join me on Mixer as we challenge these three WWE superstars, Xavier Woods, AJ Styles, and Tyler Breeze, to survive a gameplay deep dive from right here in the Hive.
[72:41.55]For those of you at home, for the next two days, you and your friends can play in select Microsoft stores.
[72:47.19]So good luck out running the swarm, and we'll see you on the leaderboards.
[72:50.67]Oh, and for anyone who pre-orders or plays within the first week, I've got something special just for you.
[72:56.34]What is it?
[72:58.97]No, not the ice.
[72:59.85]It's getting cold in here.
[73:03.10]They all freeze up.
[73:07.11]Special fucking pre-order armor set with extra fucking buttons on it.
[73:30.44]It's the Terminator!
[73:32.40]Oh my god.
[73:43.44]Games are so weird now.
[73:44.89]What is this?
[73:52.21]It's a new mouse?
[73:55.99]New controller?
[73:57.47]The Xbox Elite mouse.
[74:01.47]It's not about a controller.
[74:02.53]It is.
[74:02.67]It's a controller.
[74:03.63]The world's most advanced controller.
[74:06.27]That's too many buttons.
[74:07.15]That's too much.
[74:08.25]That's like freaking me out.
[74:12.51]The thumb stick comes off and then turns the car into an engine in there.
[74:19.38]That's actually really cool.
[74:28.18]you change the thumbstick that's it that's really cool this is awesome is this like 500 bucks can you get an xbox elite controller or a vibe let's find out all right all really cool things all really awesome features looks great can I experience virtual reality or own a new controller

[75:13.16]Let's find out how much it is.
[75:15.30]How much is it?
[75:21.71]You watch this, I'll forget so.
[75:28.41]When my father saved my life, he told me never to forget who I am, where I come from.
[75:36.64]But in this place, nobody even wants to know my name.
[75:39.70]Getting attached is deadly.
[75:43.60]Father, maybe we'll talk about... Oh, every game is like the same five games.
[75:46.29]Every game also uses the same five voice actors.
[75:49.29]I might be gone.
[75:56.31]We're getting to, like, just, like, shake us all up in a jar.
[76:01.07]But I won't let it turn me into an animal.
[76:08.93]Staying alive became the essence of our existence, yet life must be more than just survival.
[76:16.20]It's $150, by the way, but I can pay.
[76:19.12]Every day, the disease tries to crush us and make us forget who we are, but I keep fighting.
[76:30.40]My name is Aiden.
[76:32.78]And I am infected.
[76:40.80]Dying Light was fun.
[76:44.80]Maybe it'll be, uh, fun again.
[76:47.26]A second time.
[76:50.24]World Premiere.
[76:53.45]I'm gonna be on camera for, like, at least ten seconds on this one.
[76:56.07]Just in case I need to do, like, a fucking big reaction.
[77:07.88]He steps on the gas, starts peeling out of the stage.
[77:10.68]No, they put a jump on the stage, and he hits the gas, and it goes zero to 60, goes over the fucking jump, over the audience, like Evel Knievel style.
[77:22.01]Lands over them, everyone's like, holy fuck!
[77:35.09]It's LEGO!
[77:36.94]Why do they have to do this to every single franchise?
[77:42.46]LEGO!
[77:42.98]I just gave myself a headache.
[77:46.10]Why does everyone have to have LEGO counterparts?
[77:50.38]LEGO!
[77:51.06]I gotta shut up!
[77:52.18]I gotta be quiet!
[78:26.79]I think they just figured out how to make double the money.
[78:30.67]Just make a video game and make a LEGO counterpart.
[78:36.18]Just re-skin it as a LEGO game and it'll sell twice as much every time.
[78:45.89]combine McLaren's passion for design with about half a million of LEGO's legendary bricks.
[78:52.16]The best incredible life-size LEGO Speed Champions McLaren Senna.
[78:58.63]Now watch me destroy it with this baseball bat.
[79:03.11]It took him 200 hours to make this fucking thing.
[79:05.23]The Forza Horizon 4 LEGO Speed Champions expansion.
[79:09.32]You will drive this Senna and more LEGO Speed Champions cars in an entirely new world, packed with inventive new challenges, new areas to explore, and loads of bricks to smash.
[79:21.64]The Forza Horizon 4 LEGO Speed Champions expansion launches this week.
[79:27.42]I'll see you there.
[79:29.16]That was an expansion.
[79:30.12]A lot of, like, gotcha expansions in this conference.
[79:35.36]Oh yeah, they're already doing it.
[79:37.58]They're doing it already.
[79:38.72]They're doing it already.
[79:40.20]They already did it.
[79:40.79]I remember this.
[79:41.21]Thank you, fucking, three years ago.
[79:42.37]They're already doing this.
[79:44.41]That's the steps you gotta do.
[79:47.29]They actually are doing it.
[79:53.71]You have to appeal to every single potential customer now.
[79:58.95]What's the age range for your free game or your franchise?
[80:04.30]I want everyone to be able to play that game.
[80:06.68]I want everyone to buy it.
[80:08.24]We're talking diapers to retirement.
[80:11.89]1 to 80.
[80:44.78]What happened to just playing chess?
[81:02.43]LEGO chess.
[81:04.07]My mission, find the father I never knew.
[81:07.67]My mission, find a hero I've never met.
[81:11.24]He hasn't radioed in days.
[81:13.80]He hasn't been seen since the outbreak.
[81:16.65]The last time I heard his voice.
[81:18.75]The last place he was seen was in Trouble Valley.
[81:24.57]Trouble Valley.
[81:27.03]Trouble Valley.
[81:28.23]I've only heard whispers.
[81:29.83]Trouble Valley.
[81:31.25]I've only heard legend.
[81:32.95]Of unseen horrors.
[81:37.79]Here, we are the many.
[81:40.21]Here, we can become stronger.
[81:43.93]For so long, I was just surviving.
[81:47.13]Now people are counting on me.
[81:48.53]This was written by a computer.
[81:50.84]This is where my story could end.
[81:55.26]This is where my story could begin.
[81:57.26]I thought we had seen everything.
[82:03.82]We ain't seen nothing yet.
[82:16.54]What?
[82:16.74]It's another fuckin' gacha!
[82:18.21]What is this?!
[82:20.81]It's a State of Decay 2 heartland!
[82:24.13]It's another, like, gacha expansion!
[82:28.95]Every game has become so... diluted together that, like, I think these are new games, but they've already existed and they're just expansions.
[82:35.79]I'm stupid!
[82:38.01]Oh my god, are we gonna get so- LEGO SONIC!
[82:41.70]LEGO SONIC incoming!
[82:47.97]What is... Wait, is this... Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[82:50.78]Is this actually it?
[82:56.17]Is this Phantasy Star?
[82:57.11]If it's Phantasy Star, I'm gonna get it.
[83:33.21]I don't think it is.
[83:35.96]Oh, is it?
[83:37.56]I can't tell.
[83:38.30]I can't tell.
[83:41.60]It's either a Gears of War game or like an anime sword fighter game.
[83:47.44]I can't tell anymore.
[84:04.10]No, no, is it?
[84:05.00]Is it?
[84:05.22]I don't think it is.
[84:14.33]It is.
[84:15.43]It actually is.
[84:19.70]That gave me a reaction.
[84:20.69]Those of you who have played Phantasy Star know that this game had influenced many of the most popular games today.
[84:27.15]This game was sick.
[84:28.15]So with great delight, we welcome Sega back to our stage and Phantasy Star back on Xbox.
[84:38.32]That's actually pretty cool.
[84:39.54]This is a classic.
[84:40.54]As we said, our goal on Team Xbox is to bring you the world's best games.
[84:46.62]Meeting with developers, playing their games, and introducing you to their games, these are the best parts of my job.
[84:55.34]Back at E3 2017, when I first met with the creators of this next game, they shared their ambition.
[85:03.22]to bring their massively popular game with its passionate community of 650 million PC players to the entire world.
[85:12.39]I'm happy to announce our partnership with the legendary team at Smilegate.
[85:19.35]Their approach to game design demonstrates sheer creative boldness.
[85:24.85]Next year, you'll discover the newest entry in this landmark franchise.
[85:31.13]On console for the very first time, only on Xbox.
[85:36.55]This is Crossfire X. World premiere.
[85:43.06]What the fuck is Crossfire X?
[85:48.08]Am I supposed to know what this is?
[85:51.52]Crossfire X?
[85:53.00]Did he make up those numbers?
[85:54.66]Did he make that up?
[85:55.82]Was that a joke?
[85:57.36]What is Crossfire X?
[86:20.80]First to console.
[86:23.22]I'm going to get more about Phantasy Star 2.
[86:24.94]That's fucking pretty big deal.
[86:33.32]It's a mobile game?
[86:34.60]Oh.
[86:38.84]Wait, a mobile game is the most played FPS in the world?
[86:41.48]Is that what he said?
[86:57.96]Crossfire X. So this game already exists, and it's existed for a long time, so where's the gameplay?
[87:22.71]This is just... I've known him since 2007.
[87:33.03]Crossfire X. Well, I mean, they've got the red X on the rights block, because I ain't gonna be buying that one.
[87:50.16]World premiere.
[88:08.74]Everything we knew as truth was a lie.
[88:12.04]That person has a mask on their face.
[88:23.41]Nobody can see it.
[88:33.09]All right, I'm going to be quiet.
[88:58.19]Rise up.
[89:00.67]What is it?
[89:11.70]Tales of Arise, up. 2020.
[89:40.54]There are six sirens in the universe.
[89:43.38]I used to be one of them.
[89:45.49]My name is Lilith.
[89:46.67]Borderlands 3.
[89:50.75]Not actual gameplay.
[89:54.07]You can't do this in the game.
[89:55.65]It just looks cool on camera.
[90:18.08]I love how they have to put that in the video, not actual gameplay.
[90:20.85]It's like, all right.
[90:23.65]Is this not, is that not gameplay?
[90:42.27]There's a lot of interlacing on this screen.
[90:44.49]Like a bad feed or something.
[90:46.92]Censor out another figure?
[90:47.92]I'm sorry, that's like Chuck E. Cheese level of censoring something.
[91:09.88]In fact, I swear to God, an employee at Chuck E. Cheese gave me the finger one time when I was, like, eight.
[91:14.97]I was trying to shake the machine to, like, three coins, and he, like, came over and fixed it and gave me the finger.
[91:19.45]Come on.
[91:35.55]Can't show the middle finger, but you can show people, like, exploding.
[91:38.83]Yeah, it's like... Hey, look, I have an idea.
[91:44.71]Let's have a person's head, like, fucking explode on camera, but, like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:53.13]Let's have a guy's, like, eyes get two spikes, like, through his head, and his brain comes out the back.
[91:59.62]But don't say that F-word.
[92:00.96]How dare you?
[92:03.74]World premiere.
[92:15.79]Uh-huh?
[92:17.45]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[92:26.56]Whoa!
[92:26.88]Whoa!
[92:42.41]I doubt you could even imagine it.
[92:54.87]That which commanded the stars, giving life its fullest brilliance.
[93:04.69]The Elden Ring.
[93:08.93]Oh, Elden Ring.
[93:13.56]shattered by someone or something don't tell me you don't see it look up at the sky
[94:00.70]Elden Ring, Xbox One NPC.
[94:02.94]Wait, is this an Xbox exclusive?
[94:04.98]You got George R.R.
[94:05.96]Martin and... Oh man, oh my god.
[94:19.50]What the?
[94:25.28]Can you get somebody to talk about that?
[94:28.34]That's a way to sell like a fucking 500 million copies.
[94:31.14]From multinational studios to one-person passion projects, thousands of Xbox games are in development for you right now.
[94:39.83]Thousands?
[94:40.49]Just today, we showed you 60 games.
[94:44.48]We are now experiencing an unmatched expansion of creativity on Xbox.
[94:51.38]Gaming for you means connecting all of these creators to all of you.
[94:57.21]Last fall, we announced our ambition to empower everyone everywhere to play by bringing Xbox to the cloud.
[95:07.82]We will do this in two ways, through Project xCloud and through console streaming.
[95:16.61]Two months ago, we connected all Xbox developers to Project xCloud.
[95:22.78]Today, unfortunately, it's been hacked and 50,000 people that got connected to the cloud lost all their information.
[95:33.25]To experience the freedom to play right here at the show.
[95:37.73]And you'll have two ways to stream.
[95:40.69]There's a new platform feature, console streaming.
[95:44.83]It turns your Xbox One into your own personal and free xCloud server.
[95:53.10]This shit never works, though.
[95:54.58]Whether you're using a console in our data center or your console at home, this October, you'll be able to use our hybrid gaming cloud to play your games wherever you go.
[96:07.20]Yeah, but the same thing with the Google thing, too.
[96:10.72]It's like the latency is not good enough yet.
[96:11.92]Where you play is now entirely your choice.
[96:15.00]You decide.
[96:17.16]So let's talk about our next console.
[96:25.23]For us, the console is vital and central to our experience.
[96:31.18]We heard you.
[96:32.72]A console should be designed and built and optimized for one thing and one thing only, gaming.
[96:42.39]So they're going to strip all the other shit from Xbox.
[96:44.59]So the same team that created the world's most powerful console, Xbox One X, and innovated its groundbreaking processor and the elite controller, the same team that engineered the world-class compatibility of today's Xbox One consoles, the same team that set the bar for live gaming services with Xbox Live,
[97:09.09]this same team set out on a new mission.
[97:13.62]To create the future of gaming for you.
[97:19.96]When we think about the future of gaming, it's not just PC.
[97:23.49]It's not just console.
[97:24.81]It's not just mobile.
[97:26.03]It's really all of the above.
[97:27.85]Xbox is all about choice.
[97:29.13]We're investing in technology all throughout the game stack.
[97:32.57]The games you want with the people you want on the devices that you want.
[97:35.45]And for us, that starts with our next generation console.
[97:40.53]We don't want to build just another console.
[97:42.49]We truly want it to be transformative.
[97:44.71]more immersion, more exploration, more detail.
[97:48.76]How do we make it easier for people to get into the game, to stay in the game?
[97:52.24]One of the things that gamers and developers are incredibly excited about is reducing load times.
[97:57.32]I'm an RPG gamer, and so, like,
[97:59.96]Loading screens are a thing.
[98:01.88]You're sitting there in the fake elevator because you know that the game's loading in the background.
[98:06.10]It's just an elevator ride forever.
[98:08.28]That's our goal with gaming, is that you don't have those pauses.
[98:11.09]This generation is going to be a bigger leap than any generation we've done before.
[98:17.22]At the heart of our next-generation console is our custom-designed processor, leveraging the latest Zen 2 and Navi technology from our partners at AMD.
[98:26.11]From a pure processing perspective, this is four times more powerful than the Xbox One X. We're leveraging high-bandwidth GDDR6 to ensure that we're getting the best performance possible.
[98:37.06]It's going to usher in resolution and frame rates that we've never seen before.
[98:41.04]It will burn you.
[98:42.38]We're looking at frame rates up to 120 frames per second.
[98:47.32]8K capability, variable refresh rate.
[98:50.12]Next gen ray tracing.
[98:51.69]It's real time because it's hardware accelerated for the first time ever.
[98:58.91]What I'm personally most excited about is the SSD.
[99:03.44]We've created a new generation of SSDs.
[99:06.86]We're actually using the SSD as virtual RAM.
[99:10.00]We're seeing more than 40 times performance increases over the current generation.
[99:14.36]The combination of the SoC and the solid state drive are really what gives you a totally new experience.
[99:19.27]Now we can take all of that power and apply it back into the scene so we can actually generate more life in that world and bring it to the gamer in a seamless way so that then you're fully experiencing what the game developer wants you to experience.
[99:30.97]When you can move through worlds without waiting for screens to load, that speed, that performance is what the next generation is about.
[99:37.86]Sony fanboys backing up into a corner.
[99:39.96]Sony fanboys backing up, right?
[99:43.76]What we really want to do is give developers the power to build the game they've always envisioned.
[99:48.72]We have hundreds of people across both our first party studios as well as our third party studios working on those next generation experiences today.
[99:57.07]It's an amazing commitment to content at Xbox Game Studios.
[100:00.56]There's 13 studios, seven in the last year.
[100:02.94]That's a big family.
[100:04.60]At 343, for us, it's always about more seamless worlds with the next generation.
[100:09.90]We can bring the world to life in a way we've never experienced Halo before.
[100:15.55]We're delivering four generations of content better than you've ever seen them before.
[100:20.03]This console is especially awesome for Game Pass members.
[100:22.83]With the faster load times, you're going to be able to experience all the games within just a snap of your fingers.
[100:28.45]We're giving gamers the option to connect across devices and across platforms in a way that we never were able to before.
[100:35.09]This isn't just a console launch.
[100:36.54]This is about the future of gaming.
[100:38.86]Alexa, it's gonna be like Janet.
[100:40.86]Xbox Janet.
[100:42.70]Your console gaming experience with Xbox, it all comes forward with Scarlet.
[100:46.87]The T?
[100:48.57]The Scarlet.
[100:51.12]The Xbox Scarlett.
[100:52.84]Scarlett, yes.
[100:54.06]It eats monsters for breakfast.
[100:56.30]Here we go.
[100:56.52]You're going to be able to talk to it.
[100:57.98]It's going to be able to do your taxes.
[100:58.89]It's going to be able to fucking order Amazon orders for you.
[101:00.27]This is Project Scarlett.
[101:02.51]The most powerful and highest performing console we've ever designed.
[101:07.91]Built for creators to unleash their boldest creative visions and optimized for players to enjoy the ultimate gaming experience on a console anywhere.
[101:19.68]Immersive experiences begin at the very heart of the console, at the silicon level itself.
[101:26.30]Together with our partners at AMD, we have co-engineered and custom designed a state-of-the-art processor for Project Scarlett.
[101:38.07]Does it have a CD tray?
[101:40.15]Power you could see defined previous generations.
[101:44.93]Power and performance you can see and feel defines Project Scarlet.
[101:51.66]When we talk about freedom to play,
[101:54.43]when we talk about Xbox in the cloud, when we talk about streaming your games, Project Scarlet and all of its power and all of its performance is the foundation of our future in console and the formation of our future in cloud.
[102:13.61]Latency's got to get better, though.
[102:14.93]Ping's got to get better.
[102:15.65]It's not there yet.
[102:16.33]We launched Xbox 18 years ago with a game reviewers called the definitive reason to own an Xbox.
[102:24.88]Well, because humanity was and is worth saving, next holiday, we will launch Project Scarlet with Halo.
[102:35.10]Wait, did you just make like a, this is gonna save humanity?
[102:39.84]Oh, it's Halo, okay.
[102:43.89]Humanity's worth saving, that's why we made the Scarlet.
[102:48.01]We're gonna save the world.
[102:55.12]in lines 4, 17, and 33.
[102:56.02]Pressure building in lines 4, 17, and 33.
[102:59.53]Pressure building in lines 4, 7.
[103:00.87]Protocol accepted.
[103:33.70]That wasn't that far of a fall.
[103:38.32]That was a pratfall.
[103:42.50]That was like a WWE fall.
[103:46.10]He got like pushed off the top rope.
[103:48.60]Hi baby.
[103:52.02]Two.
[104:00.22]So big.
[104:01.42]So big.

[104:06.46]Good singing.
[104:07.46]How about, I miss you.
[104:09.39]Miss you.
[104:11.03]And I love you.
[104:11.81]I love you.
[104:13.19]I love you, Daddy.
[104:14.17]I love you, Daddy.
[104:16.07]And I can't wait to see you.
[104:17.07]Can you say see you?
[104:18.81]See you.

[105:05.36]Can you hear me?
[105:08.11]This is UNSC... Is he talking to him?
[105:13.49]Who is talking to him?
[105:14.99]He's like, look over here.
[105:15.79]I'm floating.
[105:17.69]Is that who was talking?
[105:38.29]Looks like the main power cells are fried.
[105:41.45]Armour shut down.
[105:42.15]Is he still in there?
[105:43.37]Triggering survival mode.
[105:47.32]I'm going to try to override it.
[105:51.10]Okay.
[105:51.60]If you can hear me in there, I hope you're ready.

[106:55.12]Status report?
[106:55.92]He talks?
[106:56.42]What?
[106:58.74]There's something you need to see, Chief.
[107:06.98]Yeah, I didn't know.
[107:08.11]I haven't even played Halo.
[107:11.05]I have never played one second of fucking Halo.
[107:14.47]I don't know.
[107:14.83]We lost.
[107:16.99]Lost everything.
[107:17.63]There's nothing left for us here.
[107:21.69]Flat Earth confirmed.
[107:24.07]I don't think we're here, Ace.
[107:25.41]Oh, no, that's the Halo.
[107:28.37]Right, okay, sorry.
[107:30.32]No, no, no.
[107:31.74]Not then.
[107:33.26]Not again.
[107:35.02]We need to run.
[107:37.88]No.
[107:38.74]We need to fight.
[107:43.82]Get ready.
[107:44.52]Halo.
[107:44.88]Infinite.
[107:51.42]I didn't know Halo talked.
[107:53.22]The fucking chef, whatever his name is.
[108:07.83]Gordon Ramsay's Master Chief.
[108:11.47]I'm fucking this up for everybody.
[108:12.51]I'm going to quiet down.
[108:13.75]Pretty cool.
[108:15.62]New Halo.
[108:39.51]And the Terminator is going to be in this expansion for Halo!
[108:45.66]Aww, that's too bad.
[108:54.83]Master Chief's most ambitious villain, adversary yet, the Terminator.
[109:10.07]So what did we get?
[109:12.65]Uh, we had... Battletoads.
[109:16.07]Looks... Um, yeah, I'm not so sure, but maybe it'll be fun.
[109:20.49]Phantasy Star Online 2.
[109:22.35]Big deal.
[109:22.93]Minecraft Diablo.
[109:23.91]Pretty big deal.
[109:26.09]Um... That's pretty much it.
[109:29.46]That's it.
[109:30.10]And, uh, Madden.
[109:31.40]Don't forget about Madden.
[109:34.16]I wonder how much money Madden paid to be part of this trailer.
[109:38.39]Because why would you put that here?
[109:41.15]There is no reason in a million fucking years why you would put Madden in your trailer for E3 like it was a big deal.
[109:49.21]They come out every year.
[109:50.75]Every single year.
[109:52.29]There is no difference.
[109:53.17]There's no announcement.
[109:55.81]Why would it be here?
[110:04.41]I'm looking forward to that Minecraft Diablo game.
[110:11.67]I mean, that's cool, but I didn't play Halo.
[110:13.45]I never played any of it.
[110:17.58]Are we gonna get like a send-off?
[110:22.83]There it is.
[110:23.23]Hey, now, let me ask you guys a question.
[110:26.90]What was your favorite game that was at E3?
[110:28.68]Put it in the comments section below.
[110:31.64]Hey!
[110:33.98]Man, that was a hell of a conference.
[110:37.22]It was.
[110:37.76]It was a hell of a conference.
[110:38.54]They showed a lot of stuff.
[110:39.44]I'm going to pull up.
[110:40.14]We had running down a dock with everything shown.
[110:44.92]Welcome, everyone, once again from slash Twitch.
[110:48.90]Where to even begin with this?
[110:50.80]I don't know, Joe.
[110:51.42]Like, seriously.
[110:51.88]Do we start with Keanu fucking Reeves?
[110:53.86]I know.
[110:54.26]How crazy was that?
[110:55.37]Unbelievable.
[110:57.19]I can't believe they did that.
[110:59.63]God damn it.
[111:03.07]I think.
[111:03.43]Yeah.
[111:04.01]I'm going to try to find that trailer real quick.
[111:05.95]Ko, walk us through your thoughts on what you saw from Cyberpunk.
[111:08.65]I'll walk you through.
[111:09.33]So Cyberpunk was seriously, there was so much there.
[111:12.60]Yeah.
[111:13.48]I know, I had the same reaction.
[111:15.48]I had the same reaction.
[111:17.08]When I saw, for the first time.
[111:19.40]Yeah.
[111:19.58]Oh my god.
[111:19.90]Yes, yes it did.
[111:20.38]I looked up what was going on.
[111:21.16]But we got to see it for the first time.
[111:22.46]We actually got to see it.
[111:23.46]Hell yeah!
[111:35.71]How is that not leaked?
[111:36.83]Or how does that work?
[111:37.49]I don't know.
[111:37.99]That's the best kept secret.
[111:39.33]Oh my god.
[111:39.99]100%.
[111:40.05]Now, Joe.
[111:40.57]I gotta tell you something, Joe.
[111:42.41]At that point, all the other leaks seemed like they were not that important.
[111:46.21]I know, right?
[111:46.93]It's odd.
[111:47.57]I got the papers, y'all.
[111:50.22]I feel, I'm like, I am like fucking shaking a little bit.
[111:53.52]Those leaks were like on purpose or, you know, actually accidental or whatever.
[111:58.08]Yeah.
[111:58.34]I'm sure they were like, don't even worry about that.
[112:00.82]Don't even worry about those other fucking leaks.
[112:02.54]As long as Kiana doesn't get out, that, that,
[112:04.80]Yeah, that's the most important.
[112:06.50]That's the most important one.
[112:08.30]I loved how much fun he was having.
[112:10.55]Yeah, he was having a great time.
[112:11.41]He was having fun on that stage.
[112:12.69]He was just there.
[112:14.49]I gotta take a shit.
[112:15.53]I'll be back.
[112:16.37]Just keep doing the podcast without me.
[112:18.35]I'm gonna shit my pants and then I'll get out of here.
[112:20.62]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[112:22.62]That's all you had to do was just say cyberpunk.
[112:25.42]Just hang out.
[112:26.62]It was good.
[112:29.48]Could you even think of something that would be more hyped than that?
[112:34.47]That might actually appear.
[112:35.63]That might actually happen.
[112:37.27]I haven't left yet.
[112:38.61]I am going to shit my pants about it.
[112:39.95]Let me get this out before I go.
[112:40.69]I didn't know that that was even on the board for something that could happen.
[112:44.69]Well, because they linked it to me, actually.
[112:47.15]I'm the only one that knew about that.
[112:48.75]Well, we know.
[112:49.69]I'm going to go real bad.
[112:51.63]All right.
[112:51.97]All right.
[112:52.23]I'm done.
[112:53.39]With John Wick Hex as well.
[112:57.58]I forgot about fucking the Elden Ring.
[112:59.34]That looks amazing, too.
[113:03.66]There's a lot of stuff that looks really great.
[113:05.02]But I actually do have to pee.
[113:07.42]When I get back, here's the plan.
[113:08.76]For those of you that are wondering.
[113:12.22]I am going to play... We'll hang out for a little bit.
[113:15.60]I'm going to play Cooking Simulator for like an hour or two.
[113:20.40]And then we're going to do the Bethesda conference as well.
[113:23.98]So let me just take a piss.
[113:24.83]I'll be right back.
[113:26.31]I'll see you guys real soon.
[113:29.81]Don't go anywhere.
[113:31.36]Unless you do.
[113:33.18]In that case, hope you have a good day.
[113:34.57]See you soon.
