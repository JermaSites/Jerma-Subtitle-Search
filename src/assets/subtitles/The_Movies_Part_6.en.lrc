[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.99]Good afternoon.
[00:03.03]How are you?
[00:06.81]Hope you're having a swell day.
[00:08.31]Sup?
[00:13.09]Not much.
[00:13.51]This is unprecedented amounts of early.
[00:18.94]We're fairly early.
[00:22.62]At least today.
[00:25.38]Because we have to be.
[00:27.26]I've had to be early over the last few streams.
[00:31.12]For various reasons.
[00:34.82]How's Otto?
[00:35.32]Otto is good.
[00:36.87]I had him checked.
[00:38.75]He just has some dry skin.
[00:41.85]So he has a special shampoo now.
[00:47.51]That Kim and I have to use for a couple weeks.
[00:55.40]Yeah, it's kind of like a dog lotion.
[00:56.92]Kind of.
[00:59.42]But he'll be just fine.
[01:00.82]It's apparently... This is the first time he's ever been in Vegas.
[01:04.48]And it's really dry and really, really irritating weather out here.
[01:09.09]It's like 100 degrees.
[01:11.01]He's not really used to it, so... He's been very itchy.
[01:14.99]I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong with him, so... He's good.
[01:19.79]And the reason why we started like an hour or two early today is because I have to get on a plane.
[01:25.98]I gotta get out of here.
[01:28.13]Talked about it a little bit, but... Going to visit family.
[01:31.97]And... Gonna put, like, triple time into this stream that's coming up here.
[01:44.34]I will be gone... For... Just over... Just about a week.
[01:50.28]I'm gonna be gone for, like, a week.
[01:54.01]But this was planned.
[01:55.55]At least the family stuff...
[01:57.48]Because I'm not going to be seeing a lot of my family members for a very, very long time.
[02:05.45]There's a lot of movement in my family.
[02:09.03]And siblings and relatives, I probably won't be seeing them again for a long, long, long time.
[02:15.77]So, we decided we would do a little thing.
[02:17.83]And I also decided that why not take the opportunity to really, really put a bunch of work into this upcoming Dunk Tank Carnival stream.
[02:28.23]So as of next week, I will have that stream in motion.
[02:36.33]So I will be away from the stream, but I won't be away from the stream, if you know what I mean, in a live sense.
[02:47.05]And speaking of streams, I'm gonna wait until the people trickle in here, because the last stream
[02:54.86]Before, uh, Deep Rock Galactic, we had a little bit of a problem.
[03:00.93]There was a crash.
[03:03.53]I lost a bunch of progress on the movies.
[03:08.89]But, guess what I did?
[03:13.51]I got it!
[03:15.24]I went back and I finished it, and I did it.
[03:17.68]And it's exported, and I have it right now.
[03:20.56]So we can watch it before we do anything else.
[03:23.06]Also today,
[03:24.74]There are a bunch of mods installed, so I don't know how stable the game is going to be.
[03:30.02]I have a shitload of new characters, a bunch of new sets.
[03:33.15]We're gonna try to make something in the time period that we have.
[03:40.64]So I hope to be able to... I should be able to be live for about five hours.
[03:45.22]Maybe a little bit more.
[03:46.56]Maybe a little less, depending on how much Kim is trying to get me to pack and get ready.
[03:54.24]Because she was like, hey, are you ready?
[03:55.90]Are you packed?
[03:57.14]No.
[03:59.59]Did you check in?
[04:01.05]No.
[04:02.63]Well, what are you doing?
[04:05.29]She sounded just like that, too.
[04:08.68]And Otto Etalyx is going to be dog-sitting for us.
[04:14.20]Because he's going to be sticking around, so... That's really nice of him, really good.
[04:22.23]For an ancient game, this is going to go well.
[04:24.79]I have tried a few things.
[04:26.91]So it does work.
[04:29.73]I've seen the characters, and I can't wait to use them.
[04:33.43]This is going to be such a joke of a stream.
[04:35.40]Because I'm going to just be wanting to put characters in where they don't belong.
[04:40.41]I have a plan for what I want to make for the first movie.
[04:43.80]And it's going to ruin everything.
[04:44.88]But it's okay.
[04:46.60]So, let me just... Let me be back in like one second.
[04:51.14]I want to move something over here.
[04:53.74]And then we will watch the E3 presentation video.
[04:57.97]I'll be right back.
[05:30.88]Oh shit, the mic was muted.
[05:32.48]Are you guys ready?
[05:36.52]Here it comes.
[05:37.99]It exported at like, they all export at 30 frames a second or like 25 frames a second, so it might, it's a little sloppy, but I got it.
[05:47.39]And there's a dog too!
[05:48.15]Alright, here we go.
[05:49.95]You ready?
[05:51.03]Three, two, one, action.
[06:38.31]Wait, what's wrong?
[06:38.77]What's wrong?
[06:39.05]What's wrong?
[06:39.51]No sound?
[06:41.75]There's no sound.
[06:49.43]Oh, fuck.
[06:50.01]Okay.
[06:51.67]Can you hear it?
[06:52.20]Can you hear it?
[06:52.54]You can hear it, right?
[06:53.08]Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise.
[06:55.62]You can hear that, right?
[06:57.62]Alright, alright.
[06:58.14]Three, two, one.
[07:10.85]Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise and welcome our president and CEO of Oh My God Entertainment, Greg Stroms.

[08:05.30]That's my phone.

[08:38.37]You're my co-pilot!
[08:47.13]Oh!
[08:57.03]I'm getting a reading of a strange creature.
[08:58.69]I don't know what it could be.
[09:00.73]Possibly an organic compound.
[09:04.91]What is that?
[09:34.84]Don't you touch me!
[09:36.46]I'm not gonna be part of your experiments anymore!
[09:54.72]so so so
[10:44.26]Thank you for joining us at this year's E3.
[11:02.87]We look forward to seeing you next year, where we cancel half these games, and the other half are dumbed down to a point where you're not gonna have any fun here.
[11:12.25]Oh, also sorry to say, we have canceled from last year, Booger Eaters 3.
[11:16.55]Grrrrrr!
[11:18.55]We decided it was not part of the ???nity.
[11:30.55]Alright, I had to end it. I had to just end it somehow.
[11:35.55]I don't know, some of the audio was like in the wrong places.
[11:40.97]In the very beginning, when he's like, that's who I'm talking to.
[11:44.09]I don't know why the first, like, three seconds has gone up.
[11:50.12]But look, I salvaged it.
[11:51.12]I actually salvaged it.
[11:52.06]I'm happy.
[11:55.02]I was so sad two or three nights ago.
[11:56.74]I was so depressed.
[12:00.13]But, why don't we just transition from there?

[12:35.07]I don't know what's going to happen.
[12:36.20]The game might break over and over again, but it'll be worth it, I think, at least to play with it.
[12:41.86]So, thank you so much, Bylacter Lich.
[12:43.76]That's a lot of fucking money.
[12:46.48]Why don't I open the game?

[16:54.44]Advance Movie Maker!
[16:57.39]We're going to call this one, um, Batman.
[17:01.17]Should I call it Batman or is that illegal?
[17:04.07]How about like, what if it's, what if it's like a fan Batman?
[17:13.56]Yeah, that makes it fine, right?
[17:15.56]Fan Batman and fan Robin.
[17:17.13]They're just fans.
[17:28.38]How about in the movie just called They're Just Fans?
[17:40.98]Ratman and Robin?
[17:42.48]No, but they're not rats.
[17:43.46]Okay, I'll show you.
[17:47.38]So, first of all, let's take a look at some of the new mods that we have here.
[17:54.64]We have Robin, we have Superman, Batman, and then I'm going to say this is the Burger King.
[18:01.97]But that's like for, you know, should we do the Burger King one first?
[18:04.11]We do like the Burger King King.
[18:05.51]We got R2-D2.
[18:12.96]We have like Warcraft characters.
[18:18.18]There it is, there's like the Iceman.
[18:23.22]Here's Darth Vader.
[18:31.25]I think I want to do the Burger King movie first.
[18:34.82]Yeah, that's Batman and... Fan Batman and Fan Robin versus Fan Mr. Freeze.
[18:41.59]Make him gold.
[18:51.95]Light bulb Vader.
[18:55.23]Yeah, I got Chewbacca.
[18:56.29]I don't even know what this is supposed to be.
[18:59.61]Okay, there's no dick, right?
[19:00.99]Alright, good.
[19:06.71]Should I make the king?
[19:07.45]I think I'm gonna do the king.
[19:10.83]Let's do a Burger King.
[19:15.37]Yeah, I think we're gonna do a burger.
[19:16.56]We're gonna do a burger.
[19:17.72]I got plenty of time.
[19:18.76]Don't worry.
[19:21.71]No, not burger alien.
[19:24.91]Okay, we need a... This is the sneak king, right?
[19:32.89]Whatever his name is.
[19:34.91]What does his hair look like?
[19:36.98]Isn't it like blonde or brown?
[19:39.72]It's like this, right?
[19:44.72]That does not look like the king.
[19:46.08]Alright, facial hair.
[19:57.21]That's as close as it's gonna get.
[20:00.23]His hair is much different than this, though.
[20:05.97]Holy shit, there it is!
[20:06.96]Okay, I got it.
[20:07.66]It's done!
[20:08.80]There he is!
[20:11.82]This is the Burger King!
[20:15.92]Oh, it was just... Alright, alright, alright.
[20:17.60]We're good?
[20:18.16]Same hair color, right?
[20:19.30]Yeah, it's that.
[20:22.90]What color are the Burger King's eyes?
[20:27.68]They're like green?
[20:30.34]Fan Burger King, yeah.
[20:32.96]They're not red?
[20:42.07]No, this is fucked up.
[20:46.93]Demonic Burger King.
[20:50.31]No, it can't be like that.
[20:52.65]There we go, that's better.
[21:02.52]Okay, alright.
[21:05.50]So, let's get you in that costume.
[21:07.32]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:12.41]Alright, you're good.
[21:14.43]What happened to your hair?
[21:22.34]Why did his hair just turn into a plastic bag from the grocery store?
[21:26.02]What the fuck just happened?
[21:33.86]Oh, his age went all the way up.
[21:35.12]Okay.
[21:39.62]Okay, that's better.
[21:43.24]Alright, we got our Burger King.
[21:57.03]I'm protected.
[22:05.37]Alright, we need, who else needs to be, this would be like a promotion, right?
[22:08.58]This is going to be a promotional video.
[22:15.98]Hold on, I've got to protect myself here.
[22:30.67]Okay, I think I'm more protected here.
[22:34.91]Um, so what do I want you to be able to receive?
[22:37.71]Maybe just a couple of customers?
[22:47.57]They always do like a DC, no, Batman and Robin is later.
[22:57.26]I don't have any other like McDonald's characters.
[23:05.25]Should this be a fan of Star Wars promotion?
[23:09.33]A fan of the Burger King?
[23:25.61]No, I want... Hold on.
[23:27.91]Why is this empty?
[23:29.95]Why is it just an empty space?
[23:32.39]Why does this one not work?
[23:37.58]I think this one might be broken.
[23:46.83]Oh, yeah, we could do a clown.
[23:47.92]Yeah, okay, we could do... Yeah, we're gonna save our modded... We're gonna do a clown.
[24:00.89]Did I have any, I think I put some more, okay, no, it's an angel.
[24:10.69]Patient?
[24:13.31]What if they just said like, no, no, I can't do that.
[24:17.09]I'm a fan of Burger King.
[24:21.11]Perfect.
[24:22.29]What's Burger King's colors?
[24:25.13]Red and yellow, right?
[24:25.95]Wait, what?
[24:28.01]Burger King's colors are red and yellow?
[24:30.97]Just like McDonald's!
[24:36.05]Holy shit, that just hit me like a ton of bricks right here.
[24:38.25]It's red and yellow.
[24:43.27]Wait, it's red, yellow, and blue.
[24:44.96]Okay.
[24:46.18]That saves it.
[24:53.02]No yellow?
[24:57.16]The uniform is brown.
[25:13.63]Standard, standard waiter.
[25:16.65]It's alright.
[25:22.21]There, he said brown, right?
[25:23.23]It's alright, we'll just like, we'll YouTube their hair.
[25:29.48]To be like Burger King.
[25:39.04]Okay, hold on, what about...
[25:51.23]Just like cover him in tattoos.
[26:01.38]Evil Burger King.
[26:02.18]This is not an evil Burger King.
[26:10.40]Alright, that looks alright.
[26:14.67]This person's married.
[26:15.57]Alright, then let's also do, uh, and because everybody knows that at Burger King, there are fucking ants everywhere.
[26:26.10]So.
[26:27.90]Holy shit.
[26:32.16]It's a Burger King ant!
[26:33.53]Is it a Burger King ant?
[26:36.68]I can't, no, if you're, by the way, if you're a fan of Burger King, you know that like when we make fans of Burger King, our fan restaurant has ants in it.
[26:45.30]There's a Burger King ant right here.
[26:51.87]Yellow and green, right?
[27:00.31]There it is.
[27:03.00]Which one, this one or this one?
[27:04.60]No, it's this one.
[27:13.50]That's Burger King colors, right?
[27:21.80]Kind of.
[27:31.63]Close enough.
[27:32.31]I like this one, too.
[27:36.17]It's so ugly, though.
[27:37.52]I don't think I can look at this.
[27:39.72]Make it a french fry ant.
[27:43.89]Like that?
[27:44.61]Like a French fry ant?
[27:51.32]Okay.

[83:36.78]They're gonna throw him out.
[83:38.36]Quick.
[83:40.78]Here we go.
[84:05.19]complete that's gonna be so long that's it that's not it
[84:31.18]Didn't he just drink poison?
[85:00.16]It's the ant.
[85:00.74]We need an extra here, like a police.
[85:06.36]Work.
[85:12.08]There we go.
[85:30.83]And he was talking about him saying, and he said, and he was talking about him saying, and he said, Valentine's Day, Valentine's Day.
[86:03.93]??? right here.
[86:05.23]I love the looking back.
[86:07.99]Can I make it?
[86:09.07]I'm not sure.
[86:09.63]Let's see if I can do it.
[86:10.71]I'm going to try.
[86:11.97]I'm going to try.
[86:13.67]That's how the movie ends.
[86:24.39]You're trying so hard to land on your back.
[86:28.99]You are jumping.
[86:30.05]You are trying to hurt yourself.
[86:34.45]This is, please, God, try to hurt me as much as possible.
[86:40.63]You die from that, right?
[86:42.35]Do you die from that?
[86:44.77]I think you do.
[86:46.71]Will you?
[86:47.51]I don't know.
[86:47.81]It would change your whole life.
[86:55.22]You would change everything.
[87:09.70]Okay.
[87:10.86]Good.
[87:11.96]Great.
[87:13.40]He doesn't even notice.
[87:18.75]Cut to the hospital.
[87:21.83]Just cut immediately to the hospital.
[87:29.35]Where's the hospital?
[87:36.41]Ugh.
[87:48.37]What is going on?
[87:55.46]No, no, no.
[87:55.92]I think they could arrest him in the bed.
[87:58.26]How is this a hospital?
[88:02.82]Hospital bedroom.
[88:10.19]Slow start.
[88:12.93]Now, wake up.
[88:36.08]Wake up.
[88:37.08]Confused.
[88:47.06]It doesn't really look like a hospital.
[88:49.20]Just cut to a funeral of the aunt.
[88:54.10]That makes more sense.
[88:56.10]If this is a hospital, it would be better.
[89:05.76]Got to heaven.
[89:07.90]Or hell.
[89:09.48]Should it be heaven or hell?
[89:16.91]How is this heaven?
[89:24.42]Heaven?
[89:39.30]Don't ask me.
[89:39.84]OK, I think it's just supposed to be bright.
[89:41.96]Yeah, he's just going to walk around aimlessly.
[90:11.19]And then you disappear.
[90:12.65]Because you're not going to be in this.
[90:23.75]He's just like, wait, what?
[90:25.83]How did I get here?
[90:40.51]No, the old man in the crown also died, is what you meant to say.
[90:45.85]Do the dumpster scene again with the old man in the crown.
[90:49.76]But he ends up in hell.
[90:51.20]No, but he already died.
[90:52.16]No, no, no, no.
[91:01.32]I can't do this.
[91:02.26]I can't do it twice.
[91:03.70]I do that every time.
[91:05.24]Somebody told me.
[91:05.92]They came in and they said, you do it every time.
[91:08.79]You make the thing happen twice.
[91:16.49]If I can have him do it in hell, I will, okay?
[91:19.31]If I can jump into dumpster in hell and then he wakes up somewhere else, I will.
[91:30.87]Okay, hell.
[91:36.75]No, no, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[91:37.97]We gotta go... Uh, we gotta go back inside of the pizza place.
[91:53.59]Okay.
[92:20.14]He's lifting his arm up.
[92:28.70]He's
[93:09.29]No, no, no, no.
[93:26.08]Carry him to the dumpster.
[93:27.23]No, no, no.
[93:29.59]He's gonna wake up in hell now.
[93:41.44]No, no, what are you doing?
[93:43.84]I want you.
[93:48.75]Got you.
[93:51.21]Throw into dumpster.
[94:00.49]The ant is my favorite one.
[94:02.55]Like, ever.
[94:25.83]Where is it?
[94:32.99]Alleyway, alleyway, where is it?
[94:44.36]Am I stupid?
[95:04.56]No, it's gotta be... I gotta have a close-up of her throwing.
[95:12.36]And then cut to this.
[95:54.67]So it's going to go from here.
[96:07.74]Like, from here.
[96:09.52]Okay.
[96:12.82]Oh, no, no, no.
[96:18.30]What's going on?
[96:18.84]What happened?
[96:21.29]Oh, I didn't mark it.
[96:23.50]Oops!
[96:23.82]I didn't think I had to.
[96:43.71]That's so fucking horrible.
[97:06.58]So now a scene before this, I need to have like a closeup of putting the body down or throwing something.
[97:20.57]So let's just go, I wonder if there's a good, yeah, throw will look alright if I get close enough.
[97:30.80]Throw away or thrown out will be okay.
[97:35.88]Because there's a very clear shove.
[97:37.86]There we go.
[97:38.26]Yeah, this is perfect.
[97:49.97]Now, who was it?
[97:52.72]Was it you?
[97:53.20]Was it somebody?
[97:56.44]I think it's you.
[98:18.15]Let's get rid of you as an actor.
[98:20.83]You're not going to be in this frame.
[98:28.38]We also need to respect the line here.
[98:56.02]I wish I could get rid of the door.
[99:06.21]You know what?
[99:07.21]It actually works.
[99:08.87]If that was the king.
[99:10.75]Oh, this is perfect.
[99:11.97]Yeah, this works.
[99:22.39]I was afraid that I'm... Because I didn't know if it looked like it was going to be falling or not.
[99:33.24]This is going to be horrible.
[99:34.16]I hope you guys understand.
[99:46.89]Why did the hair change?
[99:55.79]It's the wrong actor?
[99:56.73]I thought it wasn't Lola.
[100:01.81]Who is it?
[100:02.48]Marine?
[100:11.79]I mean, no?
[100:14.03]Who was it before?
[100:14.74]Let's see.
[100:15.08]We can see who it is.
[100:18.44]No, it is this.
[100:19.06]It's this girl.
[100:22.46]I think their clothes change and their hair change every time.
[100:27.03]No, it's fine.
[100:33.11]Alright, mark it.
[100:39.44]And then she falls in too.
[100:41.64]Cause she walked off.
[100:48.59]Okay.
[101:03.72]Then we gotta be in hell.
[101:21.09]Heaven.
[101:21.91]Hell.
[101:22.39]Oh, I get it.
[101:27.63]It's just... Alright.
[101:29.15]Should Scream spin and then pull the whole thing out and he's in hell?
[101:45.56]Hold on.
[101:46.88]I do have, like, a demon.
[101:55.82]Group chase?
[101:56.67]All the demons.
[101:57.71]Yeah, absolutely.

[103:25.18]Yeah, I'm gonna put like a devil on the horse.
[103:39.01]Scream, spin, or riot?
[103:42.71]Scream, spin, scream, spin, scream, spin!
[103:51.47]Are you sure about that?
[103:52.43]Are you sure?
[103:53.29]100%?
[103:53.35]You sure about this?
[103:56.83]Like, are you sure?

[105:26.75]Oh, never mind.
[105:27.28]Sorry, I can't do that.
[105:27.94]I have to change this.
[105:40.41]There we go.
[105:49.94]I will add a Scream Spin before this, and this will play us out.
[105:54.71]Don't worry, I got this.
[105:55.63]I got this, I got this.
[106:09.06]Scream Spin.

[107:13.58]I need to add an angel here.
[107:26.96]Just so it's very clear.
[107:46.57]Is that its soul?
[107:50.49]That could be its soul.
[107:52.53]There's a lot of meaning here.
[107:53.49]Okay.

[113:27.37]3, 2, 1, GO!
[113:28.51]We're being ruined.
[113:30.03]What are you guys talking about?
[113:51.73]No, the scenes, the scene placement doesn't matter, because we can change it in editing.
[113:58.19]No, if you weren't here in the last few streams, you don't, that doesn't matter.
[114:02.49]Switch it around.
[114:04.53]Yeah, that don't matter.
[114:06.86]Alright, here we go!
[114:09.36]Post-production!
[114:13.60]This is where the fun begins.
[114:19.47]We can fix it in post, that's true.
[114:22.24]That is what we plan to do.
[114:36.41]It's so funny how this progressed to... Oh, this is a funny idea!
[114:41.45]Oh yeah, look, it's the burger thing!
[114:44.86]Look at this!
[114:45.62]How fucked up this re- I'm terrified now.
[114:48.34]I'm scared.
[114:49.36]I don't want to get in trouble.
[114:50.26]I gotta change this.
[114:51.94]It progressed.
[115:00.12]But that's what happens in the editing room.
[115:01.41]You figure out what you can and can't do, and then you do it.
[115:06.49]So, first things first.
[115:09.71]The most important thing I would say is...
[115:14.61]We need to do some rearranging.
[115:16.43]And we're going to cut everything.
[115:18.41]What's the music, first of all?
[115:21.29]It's actually kind of perfect.
[115:24.77]Okay, so this is way too long.
[115:52.64]Maybe I should start with him just holding it.
[116:00.50]How long?
[116:00.82]This is like 40 seconds.
[116:02.86]This doesn't need to be this much.
[116:03.88]I think it's right here.
[116:34.75]Alright, no, no, no, we're gonna do some intercutting here, because this intercutting, because this is one of these, like, weird fucked up plans that was, like, running the restaurant into the ground.
[116:42.25]So, like, right here, we'll cut, like, let's see.
[116:47.27]Right here.
[117:13.21]We're saved.
[117:15.69]So let's go like this.
[117:17.30]Alright, let's take a look at how this looks.
[117:23.28]Sooner.
[117:23.56]Right here.
[117:49.33]Sounds like Sonic music.
[117:50.64]Bank.
[117:51.24]Money.
[117:51.68]Got back.
[118:21.34]Paying the, uh, ant?
[118:30.83]Right when it comes up in the air, I think right, like, here.
[118:33.81]I'd say right here.
[118:35.75]Let's take a look.
[118:37.69]Maybe, like, right before it comes up.
[118:43.18]I think right here is safe.
[118:55.39]And that goes over here.
[118:58.80]Actually, I think it should be shorter.
[119:01.70]There it is.
[119:39.56]That's good right there.
[119:48.05]The rest is... Now he gets in some... Doesn't he get in people's faces too?
[119:57.38]I'm not sure we even need that.
[120:02.22]I don't think we need him getting in somebody's face.
[120:11.05]Maybe a couple more of those beats, like... Bam!
[120:14.65]Like, he can do it right in everybody's face.
[120:19.45]Where's another one of those, like, big hits?
[120:23.92]Alright, let's use the... We got this one.
[120:27.84]It's right, like, here.
[120:45.20]right bang right there get rid of this portion just add it to the extended edition let's see what it looks like if I just put it over here now wait what happened
[121:17.81]I don't understand.
[121:18.39]What is that?
[121:18.69]Oh, no, it's the song.
[121:27.31]It's the song.
[121:28.29]It's the song.
[121:31.21]Right.
[121:31.37]You can't edit to... I forgot.
[121:33.35]You can't edit to sounds in songs.
[121:37.99]I forgot because it changes everything.
[121:42.96]Yeah.
[121:43.52]I keep forgetting.
[121:44.28]I can't treat this like Final Cut or Premiere.
[121:48.29]No, I don't like how that is I think I want the close-up one.
[121:53.72]Yeah, I want the close-up
[122:18.00]Where's the close-up when he gets right in his face?
[122:20.13]Right here.
[122:44.56]What is this movie?
[122:45.22]This is a food restaurant that is in, like, trouble and shit.
[122:55.09]And there's nothing to do with any restaurant you've already known about.
[123:12.56]No, no, no.
[123:13.06]Where is it?
[123:14.80]Right here?
[123:15.42]There we go.
[123:17.48]Alright, let's see.
[123:19.78]Oh yeah, these guys have to come in.
[123:47.43]I do want to have this one pop in somewhere too.
[124:04.44]He's just constantly berating his employees.
[124:16.89]Let's cut it right there.
[124:26.29]Back to back.
[124:27.42]This is fucking so stupid.
[124:51.04]I'm like doing it to the music and I shouldn't be.
[124:53.94]I don't know why this is a music video.
[124:56.11]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[125:02.58]It's just becoming a music video.
[125:29.26]I don't know why.
[125:30.42]I don't know why.
[125:31.16]It just is.
[125:39.82]That's where it's going.
[125:46.74]Okay, now they come in.
[125:54.55]This has to be like right here.
[126:02.86]That looks good.
[126:03.43]They walk in.
[126:53.23]it's not perfect it's not perfect but like it it's hard to edit with this timeline but I think it's pretty good I like this like west side story type intro by the way he's serving him poison anybody catching that
[127:47.81]Everyone's like sits down and starts like eating and choking.
[127:50.75]Alright, let's get rid of this.
[128:12.27]Alright, hold on.
[128:15.47]Let's see.
[128:15.93]How's it be together so far?
[128:35.18]You can already start to hear people coughing.
[128:43.78]Boom, like food.
[128:52.84]I think this is wasted space here.
[129:01.55]I'm going to save it just in case.
[129:02.75]Well, I'm going to actually save it.
[129:06.09]Okay, I don't think we need all this.
[129:09.87]We definitely need this though.
[129:23.36]I need this over here.
[130:06.63]Let's keep this clip for when we need it.
[130:14.56]I'm gonna put so much, like, so many fucking sneezes and shit back here.
[130:17.34]Wait, should we go back to eating after that?
[130:50.71]It matches perfectly.
[130:51.97]Alright, need another one.
[130:55.18]Cut to them ordering.
[131:27.57]Right here.
[131:31.33]I will take this please.
[131:58.65]This is not even a central character.
[132:00.55]Why do we care?
[132:17.10]What is going on on the left side of the screen?
[132:35.29]Right here.
[132:38.63]Right when it goes in.
[132:39.49]Like, in the mouth.
[132:40.97]Like, right here.
[132:52.10]What the hell does he do back here?
[132:53.18]Oh, he's just cleaning the bar?
[132:59.30]This goes here.
[133:14.46]I don't think we need any more of that.
[133:17.75]Let's watch it from here.
[133:51.23]Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, what's the problem?
[133:53.63]I'm just tending bar.
[134:15.68]Is he gonna zip his pants?
[134:32.46]He's daydreaming.
[134:39.18]Alright, let's see how this looks over here.
[134:44.28]It was right here.
[134:57.81]Sometimes the music feels like it doesn't line up the way it did previously.
[135:02.18]You know what I'm saying?
[135:03.49]Because I have to cut more off the snow.
[135:06.33]It's not going to be perfect, but it'll still be funny.
[135:08.80]Right?
[135:09.08]It'll still be fun.
[135:58.04]Oh, my god.
[136:00.28]Self-serving.
[136:03.56]OK.
[136:06.76]This is where he doesn't notice that people are coughing.
[136:13.28]And this is when they leave.
[136:33.59]Okay, that looks good because what's gonna happen here is it's gonna be like New music well, this is not gonna be a music video anymore as of like once the song is over and we're almost at this is almost it and
[137:07.14]Okay, somebody gets like, okay, what's going on here?
[137:11.36]Something else happens.
[137:12.52]Yeah, they go, they leave.
[137:13.74]Like, ooh, I don't like this place.
[137:19.59]Oh, then there's like a fucking huge fight here.
[137:21.49]Everyone leaves.
[137:24.07]Why are they sleeping?
[137:26.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[137:28.74]I should probably put this...
[137:58.68]Hold on, wait, we can't be doing both things.
[138:02.20]We can't be doing both at the same time.
[138:20.02]Is it Dream?
[138:20.82]No, but he, okay, he's tending bar, but he wasn't, actually, he's asleep here.
[138:28.40]So these two things didn't happen.
[138:35.18]This is happening.
[138:36.88]So then why would he be daydreaming about himself sleeping, dreaming about himself on the beach, which is a daydream of him tending bar?
[138:50.66]Why would he be doing this?
[139:16.18]That doesn't make any sense!
[139:17.63]Why would he be daydreaming that?
[139:39.95]Hold on.
[139:41.93]What do you do?
[139:45.43]Okay, that's gonna be quicker.
[139:50.36]Right here?
[139:57.02]Alright, I think that's better.
[140:17.86]Okay, so here's the cough.
[140:18.94]Make sure I got it in the right spot.
[140:29.99]Yeah, I do.
[140:31.97]Somebody has a choke.
[140:37.65]Yeah, this one right here.
[140:40.47]So we don't need this guy anymore.
[140:43.61]We got a great shot of him already.
[140:46.31]Just put a transition in for the dream.
[140:48.79]Yeah, but which one is the dream?
[140:54.26]Now we don't need that anymore.
[140:58.66]So that brings us to here.
[141:12.89]So this is a daydream of... This is so fucking odd.
[141:19.70]Okay, so fade out.
[141:22.16]Fade in.
[141:26.49]Fade in.
[141:45.06]I... So this is the daydream, but this is him sleeping, but this is also a daydream at the end here.
[142:00.83]You understand?
[142:02.77]Save it, save it, save it.
[142:03.99]I will...
[142:37.32]No, alright.
[142:38.94]I like it.
[142:39.86]This is like too much.
[142:42.08]I like this better when it was just him sitting there daydreaming about himself serving himself a drink.
[142:53.29]This is getting, this gets too meta.
[142:58.79]Yeah, it's out.
[143:01.21]It's out.
[143:05.87]I'm not going to delete it, though.
[143:16.18]Because what if I want it somewhere?
[143:17.72]Okay, so let's see what I got.
[143:20.08]I'm taking off the fades, too.
[143:51.98]So it needs to come in a little quicker here.
[144:23.59]Okay, it's fine but the king sleeping cannot be here.
[144:33.14]This is the argument.
[144:37.18]So let's put this over here.
[144:54.52]Keep it.
[144:55.02]Keep it.
[144:55.50]Hold on.
[144:55.88]Hold on.
[144:56.22]Hold on.
[145:00.40]Cough.
[145:00.78]Cough.
[145:02.66]Getting out.
[145:03.96]Sleeping and getting out.
[145:05.50]Let's just see how it looks.
[145:10.37]I want to give it a try.
[145:14.67]Get these transitions off though.
[145:16.39]Okay.
[145:35.94]What?
[145:36.34]He goes... Oh, this round, this fight sucks.
[145:42.75]Alright, what else happens?
[145:46.95]There's the big fight, and then the... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, hold on.
[145:54.00]Hold on, no, excuse me.
[145:55.46]He's gonna smoke just in the restaurant, and more people are gonna leave.
[146:08.71]And then he gets confronted.
[146:53.25]Are the people still in the restaurant?
[147:01.82]Oh, yeah, the person that really likes the food.
[147:03.18]I forgot.
[147:03.52]Yeah, she likes to wolf sit down.
[147:05.18]Alright, yeah, that has to be intercut somewhere in between the fight.
[147:11.70]No, we already have him drinking poison and dying.
[147:13.36]We don't need, like, another death scene for the king.
[147:15.30]Yeah, I can get rid of this.
[147:20.18]I got what I wanted from it.
[147:25.61]I don't need it, I have poison death.
[147:31.80]Okay, so.
[147:37.26]This is where we need to start to figure out how, let me just see how this looks.
[147:40.23]Oh my god.
[147:56.67]that's that looks just awful it's just awful but I don't think I want to change it alright what else oh yeah what else can I put here wait they come back in who comes in why do people come back in is it too cold outside are these the same people that left no
[148:27.01]Are these the cops?
[148:45.86]I forgot about this shit.
[148:47.28]Okay, then...
[148:51.80]alright alright alright alright so let's do this one by one here argument people come then okay that gives me a transitional piece here they come and then we get the shove right here
[149:25.00]So I don't need this portion here, I got this.
[149:29.18]And then they're gonna fight.
[149:32.60]Let's get rid of that.
[149:35.29]In come the people.
[149:41.99]Enter cold.
[149:57.46]That is not long enough at all.
[150:06.38]When was the end of the song?
[150:16.30]What the hell do I do now that the song is over?
[150:36.60]Alright, now, right when the first punch is thrown, that's when we get the, like, action song.
[150:40.93]So, like, this is fine.
[150:41.73]Let's go, like... Bang!
[150:48.43]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[150:54.01]You want it?
[150:54.79]Let's see if it fits.
[151:03.89]No, it's gotta come in when they're arguing.
[151:20.02]Someone kicked the jukebox.
[151:27.54]I don't think it fits.
[151:28.66]We need something quicker.
[151:32.00]We need something that comes in quicker.
[151:53.79]Sorry guys.
[151:56.34]I tried.
[152:19.92]That's too quick.
[152:22.74]It would have to be something like this.
[152:56.71]that happens yeah it's just like let's go fight escalates in a thousand percent no you need her eating like eating the food like really really fast
[153:29.42]This will match with this song too, I think.
[153:31.63]Her like... Let's see.
[153:44.13]Ah!
[154:10.27]Yeah, cut it right here so you think that she throws up right into the camera.
[154:21.69]Come on, how come I can't see the mouth?
[155:13.10]This is, this is a run.
[155:14.90]That leg.
[155:15.64]Eat it.
[155:59.95]I think it's just... I... Hold on.
[156:06.79]Let me see how this looks.
[156:24.34]Cyanide.
[156:25.64]Zero.
[156:27.02]With 10 community subs.
[156:27.98]Thank you.
[156:29.54]Thank you so much for the 10 fucking subs.
[156:36.06]A lot of community subs tonight.
[156:37.78]Today, should I say.
[156:38.58]Alright, get me in here.
[156:44.17]What does it need to be?
[156:45.23]I'm thinking like the wicked dumb run and then instantly throw him out the window.
[156:50.11]And then the eating and then like the puking.
[157:20.68]No, I don't need this anymore, then.
[157:21.98]Is that... Is that how... Is that stupid?
[157:26.39]Kick before out the window?
[157:31.11]Yeah, that's true.
[157:32.11]Yeah, I could do...
[157:56.16]Oh, hold on.
[158:01.70]I need to cut this in half.
[158:04.44]Bang.
[158:05.30]Right here.
[158:05.80]That should be enough to make him go out the window.
[158:11.81]How does he get in front of him like this?
[158:27.70]Actually, it kind of works.
[158:29.64]Because he's behind him.
[158:39.35]What window?
[158:40.27]Is he going out of this one?
[158:43.03]He's going out of one of these side windows.
[159:11.99]Let's see.
[159:15.29]Let's move some stuff around.
[159:19.55]See if it looks better like this.
[159:23.90]Oh, that's great.
[159:55.89]Okay, now we have... How the hell am I gonna do this?
[160:12.17]Yeah, I gotta get new music.
[160:14.37]Let's play this.
[160:16.23]Let me see how this plays out from here.
[161:10.39]Oh my god.
[161:44.40]Alright.
[161:46.22]We are about... I'd say 40% of the way there.
[161:52.03]The best is yet to come.
[161:53.73]If you could believe that.
[161:57.39]Delete the sleeping, it messes with the sync.
[162:03.55]Here's the unfortunate thing, and I figured out how this game works.
[162:07.34]So when you play from any part of the timeline, it has to load the music separately.
[162:14.60]all the sounds are loaded separately.
[162:16.98]So sometimes it just puts itself out of sync.
[162:22.16]Unfortunately, no matter if you move anything around, it's like rendering two things at the same time.
[162:30.19]It's weird.
[162:37.27]Because if I delete this, the whole thing will squish down and the music too.
[162:47.36]It's really hard to actually get anything in sync in the movies.
[162:50.98]Especially if you have a lot of sounds.
[162:54.56]Yeah, I got it.
[162:54.98]I saved it.
[162:55.34]I got it.
[162:56.20]I'm good.
[162:59.68]Alright, let me take this opportunity.
[163:01.36]It's been about three hours.
[163:02.20]Let me go... I'm gonna go pee.
[163:05.19]So I got it saved.
[163:06.45]We're about 40% of the way.
[163:07.49]Maybe a little bit more.
[163:08.49]I'm going to go pee.
[163:10.67]I'll be right back.
[163:11.88]And we'll continue this absolute atrocity of cinema.
[163:16.52]See you in a minute.
[166:09.77]Hey.
[166:13.68]I'm back.
[166:14.00]Alright.
[166:18.48]So, we've got...
[166:45.54]Alright.
[166:46.30]The music can now change to, like, here comes a situation where a guy's coming in to sneak and take pictures of the restaurant.
[166:55.15]Right?
[166:55.29]Because that's what comes up next.
[167:01.57]But then he immediately just falls down, and then they hold him down and beat him up.
[167:06.24]And he's supposed to be... He's dead here, right?
[167:08.26]Right?
[167:12.16]Oh, and then they come in with the police come in.
[167:15.74]He's sitting in a rocket.
[167:17.70]What am I going to do with this?
[167:23.14]Why does the ant go to heaven again?
[167:24.62]Well, you'll see.
[167:27.88]You'll see very shortly.
[167:32.35]Alright, so let's back it up.
[167:42.24]Let's get this out of here.
[167:45.30]Because I don't think I need that.
[167:46.20]Wait, maybe just one quick.
[167:47.94]Okay.
[168:09.04]Let's go like this.
[168:21.97]The guy with the Ghostbusters ecto-gun thing.
[168:26.02]Alright, let's go with... Hmm.
[168:33.02]How about... Eerie House.
[168:37.32]Let's see how that looks.
[168:57.46]Well, we don't need all this.
[169:01.53]We just need this.
[169:02.65]Like, what the fuck are you doing here?
[169:40.26]There's somebody on the phone.
[169:58.31]Mom, I gotta call you back.
[170:00.49]Something just went down in the pizzeria.
[170:04.10]In fact, can you, like, come fucking pick me up?
[170:15.20]Alright.
[170:16.20]Let's... So, first of all, he comes in.
[170:23.93]Maybe he should... Like, he steps on it here.
[170:26.75]You know what I'm saying?
[170:30.83]This is, like, too much lead-in room, I think.
[170:34.05]I don't know.
[170:41.08]I don't know.
[170:46.91]I mean, do I just not give a shit and have this happen like this?
[171:00.36]What if he just walks in and they grab him?
[171:11.19]Let me see what happens if he just walks in with his health inspector radar gun and then they just grab him.
[171:26.18]This guy didn't even do anything!
[171:49.83]He's the health inspector.
[171:51.13]Does that have new music on it?
[171:56.89]Huh?
[172:15.68]This is like, this is like not, not a nice movie.
[172:19.32]This is like, this is bad.
[172:20.56]This is just mean and... What's that?
[172:48.96]This should be when they... This should be... Oh my god, settle down.
[172:57.63]Why the two of these?
[173:07.18]Okay, this is back here.
[173:09.72]I need another song, though.
[173:15.96]We need something...
[173:18.98]Hmm.
[173:20.86]Fantasy Battle?
[173:22.84]Femme Fatale?
[173:24.88]Give me 24 hours.
[173:26.18]Haunted House.
[173:31.70]What's this one called again?
[173:33.92]Alone Fight.
[173:37.00]Haunted House.
[173:42.51]Let's give this one a try.
[173:43.81]Whoa, not that far.
[173:48.02]Too far.
[173:54.69]Actually, it's in the right spot.
[174:05.42]I already had this one on here.
[174:07.58]No, this is Eerie House, not Haunted House.
[174:23.89]Fuck.
[175:07.86]Hold on.
[175:11.11]No, no, no, keep going.
[175:20.37]That's stupid.
[175:22.96]I kind of like, oh, stupid that is.
[175:41.51]I don't think we need the banana peel.
[176:11.33]Yeah, these two scenes can go.
[176:13.26]But after that is kind of the panic, right?
[176:18.67]Yeah, we just killed the guy.
[176:20.73]Panic, right?
[176:22.31]Goes here.
[176:23.97]No, no, no, wrong spot, wrong spot.
[176:26.26]Here.
[176:52.63]Kill him.
[176:53.32]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[177:04.27]I'm just gonna move these around.
[177:27.58]Wait.
[177:28.96]Wait a second.
[177:29.68]Did they?
[177:34.80]They closed switched.
[177:35.62]Oh, well.
[177:50.67]Okay, it needs to be on that same beat.
[177:53.77]Hold on, I'll get it.
[178:20.24]Come on, you little twig.
[178:21.76]Let's see if that adds a little bit to it.
[178:33.87]It's not long enough.
[178:35.21]Actually, it might fit if I do this.
[178:48.32]This just delete these I'm not gonna use the banana peel there's no reason to use it It's just kind of wasted space here Although hold on a second wait wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait just a second here
[179:20.77]I like that reaction from the end.
[179:21.99]I like that.
[179:22.43]That's motivation there.
[179:23.23]I like it.
[179:43.80]Kill him.
[179:45.04]Bang.
[179:46.34]Right here.
[179:52.97]The ant is like, oh fuck, this is not good.
[179:56.33]Right, right here.
[180:05.28]Although he switches sides, unfortunately.
[180:07.08]Let's see if it looks, let's see how it looks.
[180:26.25]Well, I don't know.
[180:33.43]Hold on, let's see.
[180:38.26]Well, I don't know.
[180:48.60]No, no.
[180:49.76]No, wait, wait.
[180:50.38]I shouldn't have done that.
[180:58.11]Here we go.
[181:03.03]Hold on, let me see.
[181:13.38]Yeah, maybe before the attack.
[181:15.66]That's not a bad idea because he doesn't want to do it.
[181:18.37]Hold on, let's see.
[181:20.51]Let's just take a look and see how it looks.
[181:37.14]It's perfect.
[181:43.20]He wants nothing to do with it.
[181:55.21]He has a conscience.
[182:01.36]I like it both ways I like it he has he's like I don't want to do that he's like oh no someone's here but ready check this out like here comes a health inspector and then you've got he knows what's going to happen like oh no and he's now I have to go do this the other way is we did it and then oh no we did that we should not have done that hmm
[182:30.51]It's tricky.
[182:48.69]Yeah, it's- it's- I like it this way.
[182:55.93]You can even see he's shaking his head left and right.
[183:03.99]No!
[183:04.47]Oh, fuck.
[183:09.30]What have we done?
[183:09.90]What have we done now?
[183:22.83]Hold on.
[183:23.47]This is a little too long.
[183:24.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[183:27.21]Back, back, back, back, back.
[183:33.61]right there he looks alright no but we get to no I like I like the king like doing like the you're dead we'll just come in here good
[184:03.99]There's like a tiny little piece that's just sticking out here.
[184:07.99]Who the hell is it?
[184:14.89]The best part is how he says, You're dead.
[184:18.35]And he likely thinks it's great.
[184:20.51]And then instantly, with his hand still going down, goes, Oh, whoops.
[184:27.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[184:29.46]Your dead hand's still in the air.
[184:32.59]He immediately comes down into, oh fuck, what have I done?
[185:04.63]It's gotta be right, it's gotta be right here.
[185:07.11]Let's just see, make sure it's correct.
[185:16.56]Yeah, kill me.
[185:18.46]Yeah, oh, I probably should have done that one.
[185:20.78]That was a big mistake, I think.
[185:22.47]What should we do?
[185:23.03]Just calm down.
[185:26.77]Perfect.
[185:39.30]Vo- people saying voice acting?
[185:40.82]I don't think I want to voice act this one.
[185:43.52]I think it's perfectly fine as a silent film.
[185:47.57]I think it speaks- the whole thing speaks already.
[185:58.47]Alright, we're almost done.
[186:14.21]That's fucking pretty perfect.
[186:22.05]Alright.
[186:30.30]Moving on.
[186:33.46]Save it.
[186:33.96]You got it.
[186:34.32]I got to go in and get rid of this one.
[186:41.50]Where is it?
[186:42.02]Come here.
[186:46.97]There's another little, just tiny little piece somewhere.
[186:49.30]Where is it?
[186:51.78]Oh, no, it's just this.
[186:52.58]Alright, this can get out of here.
[186:57.41]We don't need this anymore.
[186:58.35]He's just, no, he's just waiting.
[187:01.13]Yeah, he's waiting.
[187:26.38]Okay, we're going to do some intercutting here.
[187:29.48]He stands up.
[187:31.16]Ant is like going out the back.
[187:38.57]I don't need this anymore.
[187:45.67]We got the ant sneaking out the back.
[187:46.83]Okay, I can pull this back out.
[188:01.78]um we'll go two sounds good there we go so I need to bring this here yeah the ant's like on his way out what are you doing what the hell is that I gotta get out of here which way which way
[188:44.50]Okay, hold on hold on
[189:14.77]This is the shot here.
[189:17.21]This is the shot that matters.
[190:05.69]Why would you try to escape like this?
[190:10.41]He thought that was trash.
[190:42.68]That's so funny.
[190:43.58]He even looks back.
[190:53.83]Why would you think it was full of stuff to break your fall?
[191:03.02]That doesn't even make any sense.
[191:05.70]Okay.
[191:06.04]He already is dead.
[191:10.90]Alright, hold on.
[191:11.72]This is now...
[191:14.00]I'm gonna move this over here.
[191:15.12]My fucking stomach.
[191:23.37]Okay.
[191:24.41]And then this is where the throw happens.
[191:28.33]So I gotta get this right.
[191:29.85]So like right here.
[191:30.87]Let's go put this over there.
[191:44.69]Oh, this is gonna be... I'm gonna fucking... This is gonna hurt.
[191:47.67]I already know it's gonna hurt.
[191:49.13]I already know.
[192:08.90]Okay, hold on.
[192:13.81]I gotta get in close for this.
[193:29.63]I think I need like that.
[193:34.28]I'm going to cut it.
[193:34.70]I'm just going to see what it looks like.
[193:35.64]I'm not going to remove it, but I just need to move it to here.
[194:07.03]It starts so... It needs to be like right there.
[194:10.09]Okay, there it is.
[194:10.81]I think I got it.
[194:19.02]That's so horrible.
[194:32.00]That's so fucking horrible.
[194:41.76]Wait, hold on.
[194:42.32]Let me pull this one back.
[194:49.77]Come here.
[194:54.22]Get over here.
[194:57.02]Get over there.
[194:59.16]It's so small, I can't grab it.
[195:14.90]I just, I want that little piece right there.
[195:19.62]Oh, shit.
[195:20.58]Is it, I think it might be too small.
[195:27.65]It's alright.
[195:28.63]It's perfect the way it is, but I'm just trying to make it over perfect.
[195:47.82]Just move everything to the right.
[195:48.94]Hold on, let me see.
[195:54.42]I could just do that, and then I need it to be here.
[196:04.33]Are these too small to move?
[196:05.65]These might be too small to move, too.
[196:08.13]I guess they are.
[196:11.21]Too small to move.
[196:12.69]No, we've got to keep it the way it was.
[196:19.26]Wait, hold on.
[196:21.74]Yeah.
[196:22.86]It's better the other way.
[196:36.69]Like that, right?
[196:40.17]Oh my god, that's fucking so horrible.
[196:43.27]That's just horrible.
[196:44.31]This is like you throwing somebody over a balcony into a dumpster.
[196:52.89]Okay, then I can just delete these.
[196:56.27]Can I even delete these?
[196:57.46]Or is this just going to be at the end of the movie forever?
[197:02.40]No, I can delete them.
[197:09.54]Just make sure this is actually going to delete this.
[197:17.36]Right?
[197:17.80]I'm on that scene, right?
[197:19.26]Okay, good.
[197:28.96]Alright, we're good.
[197:34.96]I love this one so much, though.
[197:36.45]The original is always going to be my favorite, because it's the ant, and he's trying to escape.
[197:48.52]He's so dumb.
[197:49.34]He just doesn't understand.
[197:50.42]Alright, now we need hell.
[197:56.84]Zoom back out.
[197:59.80]Let's go with two pumps in there.
[198:02.45]Alright, hell.
[198:03.09]This is where he wakes up.
[198:11.01]He wakes up in hell.
[198:17.19]And then he gets chased by the monsters.
[198:23.39]Let's see how this looks.
[198:30.13]That scene can be deleted.
[198:31.33]Yeah, I'm going to use different music.
[198:44.37]I'm just trying to get it in the right spot.
[199:11.90]It's done.
[199:12.98]Now we just have to make it- we just have to fine tune it.
[199:30.31]Alright.
[199:31.31]Perfect!
[199:55.54]Post-credits scene.
[200:01.96]I can't do post-credits on Fo- Yes, I can.
[200:04.40]Oh, why not?
[200:13.16]No, he's dead.
[200:13.88]He's very dead.
[200:16.28]He's dead.
[200:23.31]No, no, no, he's dead.
[200:25.03]He's dead.
[200:26.69]That cheapens the fall, if he's alive.
[200:40.62]He's dead.
[200:41.92]That cheapens the fall.
[200:44.65]Look, we can do an Ant in Heaven movie.
[200:48.96]Alright.
[200:50.38]It's done.
[200:52.22]Now we have to change music, add some sound effects, and print the damn thing.
[200:57.37]This is three and a half minutes long.
[201:04.37]You just dropped it a whole letter grade.
[201:09.10]Alright, so let's go back to here.
[201:12.62]This is fine.
[201:13.40]This is, right?
[201:14.66]This is like a music video, right?
[201:43.80]We gotta add some, like, some song in here.
[201:47.98]Not song.
[201:48.84]Some sound effects.
[201:53.73]I'm thinking just, like, yells and shit and, like, anger.
[202:02.77]There's gonna be tons of coughing.
[202:03.91]Yeah, this is gonna get... I'm not gonna overdo it.
[202:08.80]Breathe heavy.
[202:17.66]Let's put that over here.
[202:18.36]Yeah, he gets right in his face and like breathes in his face.
[202:30.53]Another breathe heavy.
[202:38.45]Or maybe like a, is it like an anger?
[202:47.61]yawn slurps no no slurps we're gonna add those later scream how about just like just like a little like that's not really
[203:16.10]I always put Scream 1.
[203:17.20]I don't even know what Scream 2 is.
[203:19.23]I don't think I've ever touched it.
[203:31.36]Ah!
[203:36.82]Right there.
[203:48.53]There's probably two, because he does two chest bumps forward.
[203:51.71]Let's do Scream 2... Scream 3.
[204:13.70]No, I'm not adding that.
[204:14.80]Let's just see what it does.
[204:32.11]Alright, I gotta ask, does this ruin the music video portion?
[204:46.84]Yes, it does, it does.
[204:48.30]So I don't need anything here.
[204:55.58]Yeah, we don't need anything here.
[204:57.44]This is like good as good.
[205:10.64]I'm gonna emphasize these though.
[205:43.23]Double cough.
[206:10.58]No, I don't like this one.
[206:12.76]I'm not sure it needs it here.
[206:15.75]That's good.
[206:16.15]I don't think it needs it.
[206:17.89]So let's add like a puke sound here.
[206:47.33]Alright.
[206:48.29]Alright.
[207:56.65]Am I George Lucas-ing?
[208:07.25]The puke would sound perfect with the music, just hold on.
[208:11.17]Hold on, I just gotta get in the right spot.
[208:36.50]Damn it!
[208:41.70]Got it!
[208:44.86]Why'd it change?
[208:47.04]I had it right!
[208:50.44]I had it!
[209:28.52]Hold on.
[210:43.78]okay I'll meet you I'm gonna meet you guys halfway here I'm gonna meet you halfway this shouldn't be here because it this is a big deal this is like that everyone starts to leave and it doesn't match up with the music but this is like somebody pukes behind us and we're gonna leave let's see
[211:57.01]I like that because yeah let's delete this one it ruins this whole music video and it's like whoa hold on a minute people are like something's wrong with somebody back there this is not good I I don't think I'll ever I'm never gonna grow up it's never gonna happen I'm sorry this is not gonna happen I really don't think so
[212:28.79]change the music here like alright wait wait wait wait wait wait this is important because mmm I need a song that can be mmm
[213:00.04]I can't.
[213:00.92]I don't think I can because I have the music all locked out already.
[213:13.73]Imagine if you were sitting at a restaurant and you had just ordered.
[213:19.95]You gave your order to the giant ant.
[213:23.31]That's red flag number one.
[213:27.93]then you hear that apparently like whoever this is they don't really mind you look at this is just like excuse me what is going on back there alright let's play keep going we need like a big sniff here you know what I mean like
[214:11.48]Watch his eyes.
[214:12.54]It matches with his eyes blinking.
[214:14.60]Is it?
[214:15.44]No, he doesn't.
[214:23.52]I don't.
[214:23.84]There's another one just now.
[214:55.76]okay there's some changes that need to be made here because this this music just this music needs to come in sooner no no no it doesn't it can't it matches up too perfectly here with her eating oh is there like a sound I can make
[215:19.34]Once I start fucking with George Lucas audio here is when I've made a bunch of mistakes in the last one.
[215:24.99]I don't want to do that now.
[215:29.33]Let me think.
[215:29.81]Hold on.
[215:31.59]What about just like horror sounds?
[215:35.01]Is there like scary sounds?
[215:52.30]Can you put in silence?
[215:54.24]Unfortunately, no.
[215:56.16]That is the one large downfall to the movies.
[216:01.82]They were smart enough to put a timeline editor in here, and it's really, really, really fun to use, but you can't individually edit audio files.
[216:11.80]This is just for the whole track.
[216:13.74]You can't make it per audio clip.
[216:17.28]There's no muting.
[216:18.54]If you put a song in here, it does the whole thing.
[216:23.93]And all importing silence would do is just layer on top.
[216:28.85]Because it just keeps whatever is underneath it too.
[216:31.62]Unfortunately.
[216:36.30]Add bone crunches.
[216:44.32]Edit the song in Audacity and then import it.
[216:51.56]I mean you know what that could work but I would need to do it to every single song and that would take I mean that would take a significant portion of time for me I mean we're currently live right now that's a that's a lot of work for what is effectively um an ant falling into a dumpster
[217:22.56]Just add a new song that's silence?
[217:25.14]Well, it'll just layer on top.
[217:29.44]Put in a record scratch.
[217:30.96]Alright, let's see.
[217:38.70]Dirt falling, metal pour, splash, phone ring, toilet flush?
[217:45.81]Maybe there should be a toilet flush somewhere.
[217:53.73]Fire extinguisher, I don't know if there's a phone ringing.
[218:00.04]He's George Lucas-ing, he's George Lucas-ing!
[218:12.56]Let's see, uh... Human sounds.
[218:16.88]Boo!
[218:24.85]I can click them, yeah.
[218:25.83]Somebody told me I could double-click them and it would play.
[218:28.15]That person is a fucking saint.
[218:29.57]Alright, um... Violence sounds?
[218:56.35]Play some of those dialogues.
[218:58.29]No, I actually, I tried to bring in a song.
[219:04.83]I tried to bring in a laugh track and it crashed the game.
[219:08.01]And we all know what happened the last time this game crashed.
[219:11.53]It screwed up everything and I had to re-edit everything.
[219:14.27]So I am not leaving this screen.
[219:18.46]Not again.
[219:20.83]Because even saving it, those of you that weren't here last time, this doesn't save everything.
[219:26.11]It just saves this weird kind of configuration file that keeps the audio and what clips you used.
[219:33.59]It does not keep all the edits to the clips.
[219:37.04]So if this is like a crash, it's literally like a landmine.
[219:42.56]I'm holding a landmine right now.
[219:51.47]Alright, but anyways, um, what the hell, how am I gonna, I need like an electrical sound, okay.
[220:00.41]Alarm.
[220:02.87]ATM.
[220:07.62]Hey, that's, that's like a, no, uh, uh, uh, don't think so.
[220:29.96]There's no record scratch.
[220:35.27]Let me just see.
[220:40.87]Was it a metal detector?
[220:50.38]What is it detecting?
[220:59.86]That's really loud.
[221:04.14]It's letting you know somebody came in.
[221:10.55]That's not going to work.
[221:20.09]Hold on.
[221:54.41]Are they groceries?
[222:02.38]Do they have a barcode on their heads?
[222:20.54]I need like a WHAM!
[222:22.54]I need something violent that just says, shit is going down right now.
[222:38.77]No, but that's like a YouTuber thing.
[222:40.60]They put like that, oh look, the camera zoomed in in two-tenths of a second on my face.
[222:46.60]What?! !
[222:51.12]No, I'm not doing that.
[222:57.64]Guys, can we hit... 200,000 likes?
[223:03.26]Can you... I don't think we can.
[223:05.86]Yes, we can.
[223:19.67]He shadowed his ribcage.
[223:30.13]He's got a bunch of expensive glass and watches in his bag.
[223:39.98]Shattered his ribs.
[223:43.91]This is chainmail.
[224:36.53]no no no too much too much too much too much too much too much too much not don't that's fine the way it is I don't need anymore
[225:25.46]Alright.
[225:27.33]Yeah.
[225:27.63]Alright.
[226:29.92]This needs to come in sooner, I think.
[226:41.32]I'm just going to put this here so everyone in chat quiets down.
[226:45.79]It's going to be removed, but I'll put it in there.
[226:49.15]You get one shot, you get one take.
[226:56.57]You get one.
[227:30.87]Disgusting.
[227:32.19]Revolting.
[227:35.27]That's just a disgusting person.
[227:43.66]Shoveling food down your throat.
[227:46.64]Oh my god.
[228:04.83]The game is so loud.
[228:06.09]I know.
[228:07.21]I know.
[228:07.63]I can't turn it down.
[228:08.49]I have to go into the source and turn it down.
[228:10.59]Hold on.
[228:11.67]But I can't.
[228:12.19]I'm so... Just turn me down.
[228:15.61]I'm so afraid to alt-tab this game.
[228:17.99]I just am.
[228:18.59]I'm terrified to.
[228:19.41]Because the last time I've been doing that, I crashed it and then we lost everything.
[228:22.87]So I'm sorry.
[228:23.43]But turn your volume down just a little.
[228:25.34]I'm sorry that I can't do anything for it.
[228:29.90]Okay.
[228:30.28]Where am I?
[228:41.69]Here, okay.
[228:45.78]Yeah, the volume sliders, but I have to remember to turn these back up.
[228:49.84]Unfortunately, it's only for what is recorded here.
[228:54.06]As you'll see, it doesn't affect any of the stuff in the actual scene.
[228:59.95]Only affects the music and the sound effects I'm putting in.
[229:06.76]So, for instance, like, when he gets hit through the glass, it's not a sound effect I put in.
[229:12.22]So I can't lower it, unfortunately.
[229:17.28]Okay.
[229:17.58]We need to transition.
[229:18.48]We need something to happen.
[229:22.14]I want to pull this, but it's... Oh!
[229:44.57]The shift in music between the scene transitions sucks.
[229:47.81]Yeah, but if this were like Premiere or Final Cut, you know, I would put transitions and spread them out and crop them up.
[229:57.77]But you have to have music on top of music unless I go into Audacity and re-record every single song.
[230:05.94]So I wish I could do that.
[230:09.70]But yeah, you use the tools.
[230:11.05]A craftsman only blames his tools if they don't work.
[230:14.89]As intended, out of the box.
[230:17.25]What the fuck was that?
[230:23.61]Oh shit!
[230:38.75]Is it like a little ant sound, Willy?
[230:40.39]Is it like a little unconcerned sound?
[230:46.12]Nature and animal sounds.
[230:47.20]Ow!
[230:47.72]Ow!
[230:48.44]Ow!
[231:07.51]Just get a real animal.
[231:08.93]I don't know.
[231:09.55]I never understand this.
[231:11.44]This is just a person going... Just record an animal.
[231:16.24]Just pull it from like a nature website.
[231:23.05]Oh.
[231:24.81]Wait a minute.
[231:26.89]I think we found our transition.
[232:12.68]I wish I could just shut this off right here.
[232:16.82]Well, I don't know.
[232:32.21]No, I think it's when they're panicking.
[232:33.59]Thunder kick?
[232:39.76]Thunder knee!
[233:47.11]It's Zeus!
[233:48.85]Yes.
[233:51.35]That is who this is.
[233:54.61]That's who's on the screen right now.
[233:56.39]That's who it's always been.
[233:58.19]And I'm talking even four hours ago.
[234:00.55]It's been Zeus.
[234:04.05]Please just... Please keep that in mind.
[234:08.57]It has never been anybody else.
[234:12.56]Alright, um...
[234:16.14]This is alright.
[234:16.88]I wanna add some like creaking sounds.
[234:21.35]Just like that.
[234:49.48]If it wasn't for the beginning part.
[234:57.16]Jesus.
[235:33.72]Why would you do that?
[235:35.68]Why would you do that?
[235:36.66]I want to click this.
[235:37.46]Alright, fine game.
[236:27.47]Ah, it's not even necessary.
[236:28.57]I don't think it's necessary.
[236:43.02]That's fine.
[236:45.30]The two is too much.
[236:46.09]It's underneath.
[236:53.05]I know, I know, I know.
[236:55.96]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm getting it.
[237:10.99]Okay.
[237:12.11]We need a police siren.
[237:17.37]Lower your volume.
[237:20.29]Hope you did.
[237:38.63]Damn it.
[237:42.53]Miscellaneous, maybe.
[237:44.56]Is there no siren, though?
[237:45.66]I thought I saw one.
[237:48.34]Anyway, uh, no, I thought that's a patrol car.
[237:52.32]Is that as close as I'm gonna get?
[237:56.52]Alright, stop!
[238:18.09]I got one shot here because I can't move it anywhere else.
[238:36.60]Got it.
[238:56.05]Another puke.
[238:57.61]Here I go!
[239:32.73]that's my favorite one okay we need music so it needs to be oh my god okay so bang right when it changes new music
[240:09.05]I can't, why can I not add new music?
[240:12.95]I'm full.
[240:23.25]Oh, I can zoom out.
[240:28.20]Okay.
[240:29.26]We need, we need, what's it called?
[240:31.30]The one from when I first did this like three years ago.
[240:34.00]Happy Stride, that's the one.
[240:48.02]It has to be the perfect cut.
[241:03.01]Here we go, let's see.
[241:19.92]Shit!
[241:20.54]It's gotta be a little bit further because it transitions between them.
[242:02.35]Okay, now we cut to new music.
[242:06.57]Back to Haunted House.
[242:11.64]That's so fucking funny.
[242:19.75]Keep it?
[242:21.21]Hold on.
[242:33.52]Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[242:37.29]Okay, I'll play it out with it on.
[242:39.33]Let's see.
[242:58.86]No.
[243:00.02]No.
[243:00.58]It's not gonna happen like that.
[243:04.44]We need to cut back from Happy Stride again at a good cut.
[243:08.22]And then hell is going to be like heavy metal music.
[243:14.51]And then we're done.
[243:16.04]And we can save it and we can watch it.
[243:48.50]It's close.
[243:49.02]A little bit earlier.
[244:25.66]It's gonna have to be... There!
[244:27.96]Alright, that's fine.
[244:52.28]We can go back to turning these up again.
[244:53.52]Alright, we're good.
[245:08.20]I don't know why I forgot that that happens.
[245:17.83]I somehow forgot that's how this ends.
[245:28.85]Come on, pull it out.
[245:34.02]Ah, no.
[245:35.90]Why?
[245:36.34]No.
[245:52.12]I need the music.
[246:12.89]I can't preview these?
[246:13.75]Aww, that's unfortunate.
[246:24.03]Does anybody know offhand if there's a heavy metal?
[246:37.55]The Last Stand?
[246:39.94]The Art of War?
[246:47.70]The last stand.
[246:48.54]We'll try it.
[246:50.66]Oh, man.
[246:53.70]Once I get this one... Okay, I have to go back and redo these.
[246:58.97]That's perfect.
[246:59.53]I just got 10 more community subs came in from Cyanide.
[247:07.27]Thank you so much, Cyanide.
[247:13.96]10 more subs from Cyanide.
[247:20.49]You are too kind.
[247:21.15]It's right here.
[247:36.39]Shit, it's not, it's fine.
[248:05.83]It really is not good, but I have to change it all.
[248:11.14]I have to go like this and then delete it.
[248:13.82]Okay.
[248:21.47]Alright, alright.
[248:22.37]Here we go.
[248:24.51]Another one.
[248:28.03]Something else.
[248:35.12]Record Doom off your phone.
[249:00.74]Doom, OST, just that first song.
[249:12.27]Oh, that's not going to work because it has to be layered.
[249:16.57]That's not going to work.
[249:18.97]It's not going to cut over the other music.
[249:22.30]Yeah, sorry guys.
[249:24.04]I gave it a shot.
[249:33.82]I'm going to do that one.
[249:46.14]Dark Horizon?
[249:49.18]Pursuit?
[249:51.72]Action Theme?
[249:55.59]The Art of... Ugh.
[249:59.09]Try Acid Base.
[250:00.59]No, that's a... No, it's not... It's only going to play for like 8 seconds.
[250:06.49]I'm going to try The Art of War.
[250:11.00]What did I do?
[250:11.72]I didn't do The Art of War last time, did I?
[250:19.24]I did the last stand.
[250:22.28]No, that was the last stand.
[250:27.02]Let's try it.
[250:29.89]Come on.
[250:30.57]Good enough.
[250:31.27]Good enough to end it.
[250:32.05]Let's see what it sounds like.
[251:13.94]It's not very, it's not good.
[251:42.49]Nope.
[251:52.74]Doesn't fit.
[252:10.85]It's like the end of a Rocko's Modern Life episode.
[252:13.74]I think that stays.
[252:35.97]There it is.
[252:41.51]It's done.
[252:44.87]It's done.
[252:45.41]There's only one thing that I need to do, and that is I need to scan the people when they come in.
[252:53.92]That needs to stay constant.
[253:01.58]Fix the heaven music?
[253:03.56]What's wrong with it?
[253:10.80]Oh, fuck.
[253:15.88]Fuck.
[253:29.75]I think this just... Hold on a minute here.
[253:44.09]I think the Armageddon's just gonna play.
[254:19.44]Yeah, you know what I think it's good I think it's
[254:55.85]I'm done fiddling.
[254:56.49]I'm done fiddling.
[254:57.01]I'm done fiddling.
[254:57.55]It's done.
[254:58.01]It's done.
[254:58.29]It's done.
[254:58.81]Save it.
[254:59.89]Yes.
[255:03.49]Yes.
[255:04.51]We got it.
[255:05.77]No crashes.
[255:07.79]No bullshit.
[255:13.21]So here's what I'm going to do.
[255:15.13]I am going to go pee while it all exports.
[255:20.67]Because we don't want to watch it like two, three, four, five times in a row.
[255:24.24]Export it, and then we'll watch it in all of its glory when I come back.
[255:30.46]Custom scanning, thank you very much.
[255:32.00]I would have just forgot that.
[255:33.40]Thank you for reminding me.
[255:35.16]Let's do that first.
[255:37.80]When do people come in?
[255:39.18]Right here?
[255:43.22]But is that... That messes up the music video.
[255:47.65]I don't want to do that one.
[255:48.49]It's supposed to be silent here.
[255:54.22]Here is where it can pick up.
[255:55.61]Did anybody come in?
[256:05.19]They do.
[256:05.51]No.
[256:11.88]No.
[256:17.66]No.
[256:22.41]No.
[256:25.66]No.
[256:28.22]He needs one.
[256:30.74]No, he doesn't.
[256:32.08]Fuck it.
[256:32.74]No.
[256:34.06]I'm not gonna George Lucas this.
[256:36.00]We're good.
[256:36.96]Alright.
[256:38.16]I'm gonna export it.
[256:40.26]I will see you guys in a minute.
[256:42.29]And we'll watch it.
[256:46.83]See you soon.
[258:41.29]Alright, I'm back.
[258:41.99]It's still exporting, though.
[258:44.06]It's gonna take, like, another two, three minutes.
[258:47.94]Was there more community subs?
[258:49.02]We're not... Sign out.
[258:51.34]How many community subs is this?
[258:54.14]Is this ten more, and then ten more before that, like ten minutes ago?
[258:59.94]Holy shit.
[259:04.63]Ah, thank you.
[259:09.98]Did I fix the audio levels?
[259:12.06]Uh, I brought them back up.
[259:13.84]They were back.
[259:14.76]They were at like, what, like 40%?
[259:16.74]40% each, essentially.
[259:20.76]You left in the fart.
[259:22.53]That's great.
[259:27.23]I'm, I did, I, of course I, I would have.
[259:32.05]Oh, well.
[259:33.47]We win.
[259:34.21]Yeah.
[259:34.37]Yeah.
[259:47.95]The fart has a deeper meaning, you plebs.
[259:56.18]And then we'll see how much this movie makes.
[259:57.62]This is what, was it four and a half hours for this?
[259:59.04]A little bit less from setting up.
[260:10.61]Dude, I want this ant falling into the dumpster to be
[260:17.36]like my phone background I want to unlock my phone and see that every day I just saw it I just saw it I you know it's worth seeing again it's worth seeing like five more times
[260:48.85]Alright, it's almost ready.
[260:50.36]Another, like, minute.
[260:51.62]Almost.
[260:53.34]Put the ant in your Twitch description.
[260:57.72]Yeah, we could do an Ant Heaven sequel.
[260:59.28]It's possible.
[261:02.29]Alright.
[261:05.47]Movie is exporting.
[261:11.61]You have to play it through one whole time before you export it.
[261:19.98]But the export takes a lot less time because it already played it through.
[261:26.46]Yeah, it's finally finished.
[261:29.76]Now the audio might not be perfect because when you export these, it does a lot of, sometimes it moves stuff around, sometimes it lags in the middle and moves a clip a little bit forward.
[261:41.63]So it might not be perfect the way we've been seeing it in the actual editor.
[261:46.58]But we'll see.
[261:47.02]It might actually play pretty well in that viewing screen.
[261:50.08]We'll see.
[262:04.41]Is this streamed for kids?
[262:07.45]No, I would say no.
[262:15.62]I don't think so.
[262:16.60]I'm about to see it in fast motion.
[262:18.82]It was perfect.
[262:19.64]It was awesome in fast motion, too.
[262:24.32]Alright.
[262:25.56]Let me just make sure it's there.
[262:28.01]Let me make sure it actually exists in that folder before I close this window.
[262:33.01]And then we can watch it in the inside of here.
[262:37.65]Does it exist?
[262:41.81]But for this, I have to alt-tab, so cross your fingers.
[262:46.21]have to go into the movies folder it's all been the culmination to right now okay movies I see food shop burgers available I think that's the one I'm going to copy that I'm being so careful I'm going to paste that onto my desktop and I'm just going to double click it just to see what it does I think we're good and it was very loud
[263:19.95]Yep.
[263:20.67]I got it.
[263:21.79]It worked!
[263:24.65]So, let's release the movie and watch the movie.
[263:27.87]Let's see what it was worth.
[263:42.00]Alright.
[263:43.32]That should be it.
[263:44.66]It is saved.
[263:47.54]It is ready.
[263:49.73]Exit.
[263:53.00]Release the movie.
[263:54.58]Okay, a new competition.
[263:57.92]I'll award three healing crystals to anyone who can tell me three colors of my aura today.
[264:04.13]It's not difficult.
[264:06.63]Down here?
[264:07.87]Where do I release the movie?
[264:11.69]Lead role?
[264:12.25]Where is it?
[264:17.38]Cannon.
[264:21.70]PR?
[264:26.88]What the hell is like the release the movie thing?
[264:33.52]Because that's PR and then this is post-production.
[264:38.43]Just do make a bunch of ads for it?
[264:40.11]Okay, I'm gonna spend like a hundred million dollars on it.
[264:51.91]It's stuck in development hell.
[265:01.44]What?
[265:02.78]What is this snort?
[265:05.34]I didn't snort.
[265:06.04]Oh, oh, I thought you were talking about when I went like... Oh, right.
[265:22.53]Alright, movie's ready for release.
[265:24.25]Alright, it's been... Wait, I don't want to do any more post-production on it.
[265:37.76]Where's this damn building?
[265:45.47]Shoot it.
[265:50.68]Okay, there we go.
[265:51.66]Fine.
[265:51.78]Release budget is gonna be as much as I can.
[265:54.74]Done.
[265:54.86]Here we go.
[266:00.35]Script quality is 2 out of 5.
[266:02.61]This is loud as hell.
[266:03.73]This is so loud.
[266:05.66]But it's alright.
[266:06.62]Just turn down a little.
[266:10.27]Repair of sets was superb.
[266:11.75]Average crew experience, awful.
[266:13.62]Final movie rating was 2 out of 5 stars.
[266:18.78]And... Are you ready to watch it?
[266:24.60]The movie sucks, but it doesn't... The critics are always just mean.
[266:27.67]Alright, turn it down a little, because it's going to be loud, because I had to turn it up.
[266:32.49]Are you ready?
[266:32.83]Let's go!
[266:35.93]Let's go!
[266:48.02]Bye.
[268:42.46]Come on!
[270:10.70]Uh... Uh...
[270:46.63]What do the credits say?
[270:50.55]Oh my god.
[270:57.96]One more?
[270:58.32]One more?
[271:06.52]One more!
[271:07.04]Alright, one more!
[271:08.16]One more, and that's it.
[271:09.78]This time, I'm gonna be silent for this one.
[271:11.40]I'm gonna just mute.
[271:18.37]That ant, seriously, into the dumpster is... I love it so much.
[271:24.77]Alright.
[271:26.05]First of all, Phylactery Lich gave another $50.
[271:29.23]And he said, I'm back.
[271:31.96]That was hilarious.
[271:32.66]I'm glad you think so.
[271:35.14]This game's a lot of fun.
[271:36.76]Alright, I'm going to mute.
[271:37.92]Here it comes.
[271:38.80]Encore.
[271:39.54]Last one.
[271:41.56]Here we go.
[273:43.20]well I don't know
[275:03.66]Ha!
[275:46.47]There it is.
[275:47.07]Alright.
[275:48.48]You've got- you've got a silent clip of it.
[275:55.96]Ant on horse- yeah, that was a fire ant.
[275:59.58]Alright.
[276:01.60]Let's see.
[276:04.85]Uh, success.
[276:05.59]Stunt rating.
[276:06.25]Difficulty.
[276:06.89]There were no success.
[276:10.25]Scene 26.
[276:10.59]That's because they were doing their own stunts.
[276:16.78]Some of the extras did stunts better than the actors.
[276:22.90]Oh, it was $266,000?
[276:23.50]Or is that $266?
[276:23.92]No, it can't be, right?
[276:24.50]This wasn't $2.84.
[276:25.02]Wait.
[276:40.90]This was $266.
[276:41.92]Strange.
[276:54.07]PeaPantsLiquidated certainly shows some ability here and should consider producing a third comedy flick.
[277:00.11]Jax really let this movie down.
[277:01.92]The crew, what a bunch of incompetent, inexperienced cretins.
[277:05.96]Jax's stinking mood could well have affected his performance here.
[277:10.75]Movie packed with originality The acting was decidedly average The sets used in this movie were clearly in superb condition Why did I make it a comedy?
[277:24.10]Because four hours ago, this was a different movie Oh, there it is
[277:39.85]Only $266!
[277:40.01]It's making a lot of nice return here.
[277:41.07]I'm going to very quickly turn it down.
[277:42.31]Because it is loud.
[277:42.79]It's very loud.
[277:43.29]And guys, I'm sorry to say that is going to conclude this stream because I have to get on an airplane.
[278:16.23]I wanted to go for a good five hours before leaving.
[278:19.49]I am going to be gone for a week.
[278:24.26]I've got a lot of work to do to work on this dunk tank carnival stream.
[278:30.40]If you don't know what I'm talking about, then just stay tuned.
[278:36.52]I'm going to visit family and I'm going to do a bunch of work on this stream.
[278:42.66]So.
[278:47.65]I will see you guys in a week.
[278:54.01]Going back to Boston, yep.
[278:57.38]Because, on top of just seeing family, I saw my mother, as you all know, a couple months ago.
[279:04.34]But some of my immediate and extended family are coming in, and some of my siblings are moving across the country, kind of like I did.
[279:15.56]And this is the last time that we'll probably all see each other in a very, very, very long time.
[279:23.83]So, I feel I kind of took the opportunity to come back.
[279:30.25]Because I obviously want to see some of these people for the last time in a while.
[279:39.11]So, I will see you all next week.
[279:44.67]Keep your eye on the sus.
[279:46.69]Don't do anything crazy without me.
[279:49.19]Behave.
[279:52.15]I'm just going to stick around for the 20 minutes or so.
[279:54.75]We'll do the bits and the subs and everything.
[279:58.79]Hope you enjoyed.
[279:59.41]The movies is always a ton of fun.
[280:01.51]I still have a bunch of other characters and other things we could do if you'd like to see it again.
[280:13.05]We'll probably do it again.
[280:14.13]Because it is too much fun to play this.
[280:22.48]Anywho, I'm going to turn this off.
[280:24.72]And we're going to transition to the outro.
[280:30.90]Take care, guys.
[280:31.45]If you've just taken off, hopefully we see you again soon.
[280:35.23]See you next week.
[280:37.35]Those of you sticking around, we've got some bits to do.
[280:43.65]Why don't we do them right now?
[280:47.33]Let's go back.
[280:48.02]There was a lot of money today.
[280:50.78]A lot of high denomination bit donations and subs.
[280:58.46]You guys are very, very, very kind to me.
[281:04.54]Thank you.
[281:06.87]Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.
[281:10.21]Seven Layer Wario gave $10.
[281:13.95]Hey, my partner Wes has been a big fan of yours for a while.
[281:17.29]Could you say hello?
[281:18.79]Thanks for everything.
[281:20.31]Hello, Wes.
[281:20.73]Hope you're having a good day, Wes.
[281:29.79]How the heck are you?
[281:32.82]And then I put my hand out.
[281:33.60]There we go.
[281:34.48]Hey, what's up, man?
[281:35.90]Hey, what's up?
[281:36.78]Hey.
[281:41.23]But thank you for the $10.
[281:43.33]I really appreciate it.
[281:47.85]We also had a ton of community subs.
[281:51.75]Herbert1234 gave 20.
[281:52.31]Dedo.
[281:52.49]Dedo.
[281:52.61]Dedo. 20.
[282:04.16]We had $50 from Bakken, $50 from Phylactery Lich.
[282:09.07]We had $450 total from Phylactery.
[282:15.21]Very, very generous.
[282:16.15]Thank you, guys.
[282:18.35]We also had more community subs from Camp Fkaren for five.
[282:25.89]Waity, thanks for the five bucks, Waity.
[282:29.65]Or Watty.
[282:31.31]When is there going to be an auto-stream?
[282:34.84]I don't think I'll ever have just a purely auto stream.
[282:40.25]He shows up from time to time on camera.
[282:43.89]He'll poke his head in every now and again.
[282:49.49]But thank you for the five dolls.
[282:52.85]Jerma lied and didn't draw sticks.
[282:56.13]Thanks for the 250.
[282:59.02]Speaking of Burger King, play those three Burger King games that were on the Xbox.
[283:04.56]Sneak King, Big Bumpin', and Pocket Bike.
[283:08.06]They were surprisingly fun.
[283:12.18]Well, there was no talk of Burger King today, but... If we were to talk about Burger King at some point, then yeah, maybe I would try them.
[283:26.45]I do remember those games, though, especially Sneak King.
[283:32.44]Thank you though.
[283:33.56]Thank you Saturnian Ocean for the $15.
[283:36.80]So last week I got my wisdom teeth removed.
[283:40.74]They finished in about 30 minutes, which was pretty cool.
[283:43.63]Too bad I woke up in the middle of them ripping out a tooth.
[283:46.87]It wasn't great.
[283:48.17]Anyway, keep up the good work.
[283:49.19]Jervis Saturn.
[283:51.01]Uh, yeah.
[283:53.05]That does not sound very fun.
[283:57.94]Did your face swell up?
[284:00.68]Did you look like a chipmunk?
[284:03.31]That happened to me.
[284:04.71]It looked like I had, um... You know when a hamster stuffs, like, seeds in his mouth?
[284:14.17]It's crazy how that works.
[284:15.57]You just have this inflated face.
[284:19.50]How does the human body repair itself like that?
[284:23.22]That insane, intense amount of trauma that we can have on our bodies and then be fine in less than a couple weeks.
[284:34.26]It's crazy.
[284:41.36]The mouth is literally the fastest healing part of the body.
[284:44.44]It just seems so strange.
[284:48.32]Human beings, man.
[284:53.23]Imagine living without any healing.
[284:54.43]Yeah, imagine if we just didn't self-repair ourselves.
[284:58.39]If you got a cut on your finger and it's there for life, what do you do?
[285:03.50]It's just wild.
[285:08.11]Well, you'd probably... Yeah, we'd probably just die.
[285:16.25]That's not good.
[285:18.65]But anyways, hopefully the procedure went well.
[285:22.31]Thank you for the $15 Saturnium.
[285:26.34]It was last week, but hopefully you're still in a decent recovery here.
[285:31.84]Thank you for the $15.
[285:32.34]Thank you for the $15.
[285:34.76]Gordon Burbman.
[285:36.80]Thank you, Gordon Burbman, for the 20 bucks.
[285:38.34]$20.
[285:39.98]They say, hey, Jerma, I finally managed to catch you streaming.
[285:43.91]Pretty hard to do over here in Europe.
[285:45.95]Been watching your content for at least five years.
[285:48.91]Just want to say thanks for all the laughs.
[285:50.89]Too many times I've been this close to Burgah Boy throwing up from the laughter.
[285:54.36]Here's to more years to come.
[285:59.44]Well, welcome from the EU.
[286:02.85]I've had a couple of EU-friendly streams this last two weeks, haven't I?
[286:06.85]I've been getting up early, is what's been happening.
[286:11.95]But yeah, I'm... Five years is a long time.
[286:16.85]I've been doing this for eight.
[286:20.11]Once it gets to ten... That's a... I mean, that's in less than two years, think about that.
[286:27.37]A full ten years of doing stuff on the internet.
[286:32.79]I'm gonna have to have, like, a party.
[286:37.14]Here comes the tenth sneeze.
[286:43.16]But thank you, Gordon Birdman.
[286:46.38]I also, from these streams, have almost Burgah Boy thrown out.
[286:51.64]Because some of these games are just so funny.
[286:53.66]They're just so odd and so interesting.
[286:55.89]You just can't help yourself sometimes.
[287:00.06]I don't know where you're getting the word burger and then the other word that is also king.
[287:03.55]I don't know where you're getting those from.
[287:34.70]Those are two words that back-to-back could mean something, but I did not make any references to those two words that are connected together to form a potential corporate entity.
[287:45.05]I'd never talked about it.
[287:48.15]On this stream today, we had Old Man with Crown, who was Zeus.
[287:53.95]That was Zeus.
[287:55.85]And people in the chat were saying, what is this supposed to be?
[287:58.17]Is this something about the king?
[288:00.63]And I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[288:01.69]This is Old Man with Crown, Zeus.
[288:05.21]I corrected everybody in the chat.
[288:06.79]At least a few times.
[288:09.77]But thank you.
[288:10.59]For the $2.50.
[288:10.83]Hey, Reapers Reviews, thanks for $15, Reapers.
[288:15.97]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say I love your content and was introduced to you through a friend.
[288:19.25]Keep doing you also.
[288:20.99]When is your memoir coming out?
[288:23.70]It already did come out.
[288:26.98]It was like the children's snake book thing.
[288:30.34]I would just put my name on that and say this is the memoir.
[288:37.82]otherwise That was such a fucked up stream
[288:48.31]It's over.
[288:48.71]Did he ever revisit the E3 movie?
[288:50.44]I did.
[288:52.10]In fact, at the very beginning of the stream, if you watch the VOD, if you open up that VOD, the first thing we do is we watch the edited E3 presentation.
[289:02.52]I did that earlier.
[289:03.92]It was done before the stream started.
[289:05.18]I hope you enjoy it.
[289:05.84]Because it is an absolute shitshow.
[289:10.41]But thank you, Reapers Reviews, and thanks to your friend for introducing you to me.
[289:18.65]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the five dollars.
[289:22.97]Five dollars from Freudian.
[289:24.99]Hey Jerma, just wanted to wish you well on your break.
[289:26.61]I hope the behind-the-scenes work on the dunk tank proves fruitful.
[289:29.79]Have a good weekend, jermaHeart.
[289:30.91]I'm going to do my best.
[289:33.77]I'm going to do my absolute best.
[289:39.36]Hopefully it's worth it.
[289:41.86]It should be at least interesting.
[289:43.28]It's worth a try.
[289:47.85]Backen, I missed this earlier.
[289:50.37]But Backen gave $100 and $50.
[289:52.94]So sorry I missed this earlier.
[289:56.30]I was probably locked in doing something.
[289:58.32]But $100 from Backen.
[289:59.52]Thank you so much.
[290:01.50]been watching you for so long since early youtube my perception of time is degrading more and more I feel but I will never forget the amount of time you brought joy to my life throughout the years keep doing you boomer to my heart p.s this Burger King conflict movie is too violent it's not it's not those things it is a restaurant it was first of all it's a pizzeria I don't know any
[290:27.03]Two words connected to make a corporate entity with a medieval king involved.
[290:31.12]I don't know of any pizzeria that has that on there, named.
[290:35.54]So, first, that's number one.
[290:39.58]But it wasn't even that violent, it was just... I mean, it kind of was.
[290:48.04]But, that's a lot of money.
[290:51.52]$150 in one stream is a lot of money to give anybody, so thank you, Bakken.
[290:59.28]Hope you enjoy yourself.
[291:00.06]Hey, Freudian!
[291:07.05]Already got you, but five dollars.
[291:08.81]Thank you again.
[291:16.21]We also had... It was a lot of community subs.
[291:20.06]My stream, Labs, is just... Fucking... Just a huge, huge amount of them.
[291:28.55]You guys are fucking awesome, thank you.
[291:31.03]You guys are too much.
[291:33.73]Uh, Smellyboythankswith250, please make a scrambled egg breakfast on stream.
[291:42.22]I'll probably do a cooking stream eventually here.
[291:44.98]I gotta be careful though, because I want to do some dumb joke and like, I'll like, light the pan on fire or something.
[291:50.62]It would be bad.
[291:51.16]It's like the one thing holding me back.
[292:03.75]But, Keldos, thanks for the three dollars.
[292:06.75]Uh, since you've listened to Red Vox, what songs are your favorite?
[292:09.19]Also, what do you think about jermaFox?
[292:13.84]Uh, let me see jermaFox.
[292:16.68]jermaFox is from, is jermaChomp, but a fox.
[292:25.20]I think it's pretty cool.
[292:28.29]I think it's pretty awesome, actually.
[292:30.11]It's cute.
[292:32.03]It's cute.
[292:32.47]It's cute.
[292:33.26]What?
[292:33.42]It's cute.
[292:35.48]I see people writing in the chat why, uh, me burning my house down would be, is like LOL quotes funny.
[292:42.68]I actually had a stream idea where I was doing a cooking show, and why would I even tell you this?
[292:48.92]Because it could still happen.
[292:51.25]Eventually.
[292:53.37]There's like a whole elaborate thing here.
[292:54.83]I don't like burn anything down.
[292:59.45]But there was an elaborate scheme I was gonna do.
[293:06.65]No, no, no, no.
[293:07.49]Not scheme.
[293:08.51]That's the wrong word.
[293:11.37]But anyways, Vinny is a very talented musician.
[293:15.61]He takes his music very seriously.
[293:18.08]And shows.
[293:18.50]Why don't we just show you?
[293:34.59]Blood bagels?
[293:36.05]What is blood bagel?
[293:45.55]Give fucks, give fucks, give fucks.
[293:49.51]I'm not gonna give fucks.
[294:05.43]Why did I say give Fox three times?
[294:07.17]Because everyone's screaming it.
[294:10.71]This is good shit, ain't it?
[294:49.12]It's very good.
[294:53.66]Go get it.
[294:55.39]Go listen to it.
[294:57.65]Go support it.
[295:07.45]I'm gonna get content claimed by Viddy.
[295:09.24]What if he just, like, dropped the fucking hammer on me?
[295:12.66]And, like, ruined me.
[295:13.82]And, like, took me to court.
[295:14.76]And, like, took everything.
[295:16.30]And I mean everything.
[295:28.64]I'm like, I end up, like, no house, no nothing, and he's just, like, laughing on stream afterwards.
[295:45.48]But thank you, Kaldos, for the three dollars, and that's probably the... That's probably two more songs that I think are really good on that album, but...
[295:57.73]Or in that catalog.
[296:05.19]But thank you for the three bucks.
[296:07.28]And he's a good dude.
[296:12.82]You hate the rest of the album.
[296:15.86]No, I'm going to... I'm going to make sure this is like... You can't clip me out of context there.
[296:31.77]Like, I know it's going to be like... Here's... You have eight seconds of a sentence you said.
[296:37.44]Let's get that last four seconds and then cut it right perfect.
[296:41.46]Fade it in a little so it sounds more natural.
[296:43.18]Add some more background music too.
[296:45.08]Background sounds.
[296:46.64]And then fade the end out.
[296:47.72]And then, you know, change it a little.
[296:49.20]You guys... I know how talented some of you guys can be.
[296:53.00]I'm not an idiot.
[296:55.34]What's this?
[296:57.24]What's this one?
[296:59.40]What happened?
[297:00.85]What's this?
[297:03.31]Oh, fuck.
[297:04.73]Oh, what happened?
[297:08.25]Hey, RoboLamp, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[297:09.75]jermaHeart, hey, thank you.
[297:11.09]jermaHeart, back to you as well.
[297:12.41]Thanks for the $10.
[297:15.59]We have an official Burger King.
[297:17.83]$2.50.
[297:17.95]This is not a real account.
[297:20.05]I want to make sure that this is very clear.
[297:24.85]This is not real.
[297:28.39]Okay, thank you, official Zeus Old Man Crown.
[297:33.10]For the 250.
[297:35.24]Good day, Mr. Elbertson.

[299:03.81]Stop listening to the one guy in chat.
[299:05.27]This is pure gold.
[299:09.61]No, I was removing things and changing and checking.
[299:13.76]Guys, that's how I used to make videos.
[299:16.20]I would sit there meticulously for 10 straight hours on the same thing.
[299:23.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[299:24.02]I don't like that.
[299:24.50]I gotta move that forward a little.
[299:26.14]No, I don't like it.
[299:27.64]Get rid of the whole clip.
[299:28.93]I hate it.
[299:35.57]I used to do that all the time.
[299:37.23]I would just George Lucas the same video like 10 times.
[299:44.05]Imagine editing.
[299:46.29]I know, really, right?
[299:51.16]But thank you, 0-9.
[299:54.72]Jack Raph, thanks for the $2.50.
[299:56.08]Do you ever think you'll be able to play The Neverhood on stream?
[299:58.16]Any of the games you grew up with that you'd like to revisit?
[300:02.66]Maybe.
[300:03.08]The Neverhood's kind of odd, though, because from every time I've ever gone back and played it, because there's never been a remaster.
[300:09.14]There's never been an updated version of that game.
[300:12.06]It's just the brick Windows 95 version.
[300:17.69]that I've tried to run on various machines over the years.
[300:21.62]And sometimes you can get it to work for a little while, but there's a very specific point in that game that's about 50 to 60% of the way through the game that you cannot physically get through.
[300:31.06]You have to like go download a save file that goes past this one point to be able to continue to play it.
[300:42.86]Or run it in a Windows 95 virtual machine.
[300:51.91]So, and another reason why, I've played through that game more than 10 to 20 times.
[301:00.26]So, I would really just... It's the same reason why I haven't really played Bloodborne or anything, because it's just like, hey, remember this part?
[301:09.26]Hey, remember this part?
[301:09.99]Hey, do you remember this part?
[301:10.73]I remember this part.
[301:11.37]You're gonna like this part.
[301:12.09]Hey, I remember this part.
[301:13.49]But there's something to be said to have like a fun, nostalgic stream like that.
[301:23.98]I'm not sure I would do something like Bloodborne, though, because that would take a long time.
[301:35.74]I'm open to it, though.
[301:38.00]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $5, Clueless Sniper.
[301:41.38]Hey, Jerma, just got my two-year sub badge.
[301:44.54]Thank you for that.
[301:45.76]The movie streams are the first I ever watched live, so it's great seeing you come back to this game.
[301:50.68]Thanks for staying awesome all these years.
[301:52.32]Much love.
[301:55.63]I'm just glad that I can still have fun with it.
[301:57.27]One of the reasons why I don't like revisiting old things that I've done or doing the same thing more than a few times is because I feel like the magic won't be there.
[302:08.55]After I stream a certain stream or stream a certain thing three, four plus times, it's almost like going back to it is like, hey, let me like go make that magic happen again.
[302:23.08]So, it's not necessarily that I don't want to, it's just... It has to be organic, it has to be something that I feel like doing, and know that I want to go back to.
[302:35.56]The same kind of thing happened with Sims 4, but enough time went by where that second time that I did it was just as fun as the first time.
[302:44.02]But I wouldn't want to be one of those people that... Hey!
[302:48.43]How much fun have I had on these movie streams?
[302:51.81]Alright, I'm gonna do this, like... I'm gonna do this for the next, like, two months.
[302:56.37]I... I would never do it.
[302:57.99]I would just lose it.
[302:59.31]Magic would be gone.
[303:05.50]So... I guess that's the answer, right?
[303:12.36]The answer to the question that you did not even ask.
[303:15.30]That I... You made a comment and then I asked a question.
[303:19.25]But thank you.
[303:20.15]I do like going back to things if it's worth going back to.
[303:25.65]Hey, Pigeon.
[303:26.85]Thanks for the 250, Pigeon.
[303:28.19]Hey, I don't know if anyone's asked you this yet, but are you coming to TwitchCon in San Diego?
[303:34.85]You've always been my idol, and I'd love to be able to meet you.
[303:43.10]Let me think.
[303:45.36]I don't know.
[303:45.76]Maybe.
[303:45.96]Maybe.
[303:47.06]Maybe.
[303:49.66]Maybe.
[303:51.58]But I don't, like... Here's the thing about TwitchCon.
[303:54.75]I kind of just, like, float around at TwitchCon.
[303:57.79]I don't do, like, any official meeting greets or anything.
[304:00.09]You kind of have to, like, find me.
[304:04.86]I've done... I tweet, like, kind of like, Hey, I'm in front of the convention center for half an hour.
[304:10.25]So I don't really do any of the big panels or anything.
[304:13.31]I'm not gonna do a... I've wanted to do like a panel before maybe, but I don't know if they'd want me to do it because that would kind of ruin everything.
[304:24.51]I was thinking about doing a... or seeing if they'd let me do a panel where I just put up like slides of like a vacation or something.
[304:32.28]And like the name of the stream is like, how to make your brand, how to make your brand easier to consume with viewers.
[304:39.62]And I just talk about where I went on Disney.
[304:47.90]I don't even mention the word Twitch.
[304:49.39]I don't mention like engagements, nothing.
[304:51.55]I just show slides.
[304:55.65]But I feel like they would probably be really like, uh,
[305:01.21]So you lied to us.
[305:03.01]And I'd be like, yeah, well, I'm a fucking liar.
[305:04.66]Haven't you seen 38% of every username in my channel?
[305:09.48]You should have known this.
[305:19.91]But this, I probably will.
[305:24.05]Let's put it this way.
[305:24.99]I don't have a reason not to go.
[305:28.26]I'm not moving, although I've talked about it, you know, I was thinking about it.
[305:33.20]But I probably won't.
[305:34.85]Not moving, not really spending a bunch of money.
[305:38.51]That's not true.
[305:40.45]That is completely incorrect.
[305:45.29]You know, I'm not spending a bunch of money or anything.
[305:48.39]I'm just, like, actively setting up a fucking carnival stream.
[305:52.82]You know, I'm not spending any money.
[306:02.07]But there's really no reason for me not to go.
[306:10.05]I probably will.
[306:12.02]Moving to where?
[306:13.02]I would stay in Vegas.
[306:14.00]Just... If the internet was still an issue, I would just go somewhere else.
[306:27.43]But, yeah.
[306:29.11]It's not really on the cards at the moment.
[306:33.05]I will be on the west coast probably for at least the next ten years.
[306:39.26]I'll probably be in Vegas for at least three to five, I would assume, maybe.
[306:45.02]Potentially, I don't think I want to live in California.
[306:48.89]I want to stay in this probably southwest area for a while.
[307:04.08]yeah I'll be in Vegas for a while why not California California is expensive it is very expensive especially all the places that I would want to live hey let's move to Los Angeles oh move to wait a minute how many thousands of dollars a month is it to live in like a one or two bedroom like apartment in la what's that again
[307:33.62]How much was that?
[307:39.52]No, I like Las Vegas.
[307:43.29]It speaks to me.
[307:45.03]It just does.
[307:46.75]But, Sarbelas, thanks for the $11, Sarbelas.
[307:49.83]No message, just $11.
[307:51.39]Thank you.
[307:53.85]Let's get the credits rolling here.
[307:55.09]And let's see all those community subs.
[308:01.57]Gambling.
[308:02.09]No, it's nothing to do with gambling.
[308:04.08]It has to do with... You know what I'm saying?
[308:09.16]It has nothing to do with gambling.
[308:11.32]It has to do with... I'm tapping my foot, too.
[308:17.96]That's not gambling.
[308:25.79]Did Psyduck just give another $100?
[308:26.89]Yeah, they did.
[308:30.67]Cyanide with another $100.
[308:32.55]Holy shit.
[308:39.17]Hey, Jerma.
[308:40.11]Been a fan for a long while.
[308:41.21]Haven't been able to give back for all the joy you've brought to my life.
[308:44.47]I'm at a point in my life where I can donate and contribute back to the community I love.
[308:47.92]You'll be missed this week.
[308:49.54]P.S.
[308:49.76]I might change my name to Jerma Lied About Level Up Lounge if you don't actually do it.
[308:59.52]Let me do the carnival first, okay?
[309:02.08]And let me see how much money is in my, like, literal Monopoly man open-em and have, like, the bugs come out, because there's nothing in there.
[309:10.35]Let me get this done first, and we'll see.
[309:17.47]He was so drunk.
[309:18.59]No, I really did want to do that.
[309:20.19]I thought it was a really fun idea.
[309:31.66]Drunk promises.
[309:34.92]No, they're not drunk promises.
[309:36.22]They were drunk thoughts.
[309:40.91]They were drunk thoughts.
[309:46.75]But... If you want to throw this kind of money down sign, I'm glad to take it.
[309:53.56]I just hope you're comfortable doing it.
[309:56.30]And...
[309:57.99]Always know that there is no real monetary obligation to hang out here and kind of care about this channel and stuff.
[310:06.71]I just hope everybody knows that.
[310:10.71]But I really do.
[310:11.41]That's a lot of money.
[310:12.20]I really appreciate it.
[310:19.08]I will try to put it to good use.
[310:21.54]Thank you.
[310:23.96]We also had... Oh, the credits, right.
[310:26.62]I want to get those rolling because they're going to fly by.
[310:31.60]Lots of community subs tonight.
[310:32.89]Thank you.
[310:33.59]All of you.
[310:36.31]The LUL boys.
[310:41.29]We also had... We had... We had... Espada Escarlata.
[310:56.68]$2.50.
[310:56.70]Thank you, Espada.
[310:58.66]Just want to show some more love.
[310:59.82]I'm starting a job with the census in a month.
[311:02.50]It's been really rough trying to find work.
[311:04.04]And like a lot of people say, your streams are a huge mood lift for me.
[311:07.62]Oh, and I hope you have a good visit home.
[311:09.28]This year will hopefully be my last at home before I head out to Colorado.
[311:13.77]Having moved back here and hating it.
[311:18.49]Colorado's a great state.
[311:19.65]A lot of interesting things going on.
[311:28.57]Colorado was actually one of the, um, one of the states that I was thinking of moving to as well.
[311:36.36]This little section of the U.S., this, like, Colorado, Nevada, even parts of Arizona into, like, I like this area.
[311:53.78]Oregon has the coast, though.
[311:55.36]Yeah, and so does Washington, California, but if you don't really care about the water, if you don't really care about beaches and, you know, big bodies of water and being on the ocean or whatever, which I don't really, doesn't bother me that much.
[312:13.39]That's why I can tolerate the landlocked kind of desert that is Vegas.
[312:18.44]Because there is its own charm.
[312:19.82]Vegas has a lot of awesome mountains.
[312:22.20]They have a lot of great, great wildlife preserves and everything.
[312:27.91]The Grand Canyon is really not that far away from here.
[312:35.61]You really like to gloat about Vegas an awful lot.
[312:38.33]I love this place.
[312:40.23]Vegas is awesome.
[312:44.02]I will talk the shit up of this place.
[312:46.08]I will talk up Vegas every day.
[312:53.82]Australia is better than Vegas.
[312:54.98]No, it's not.
[312:55.36]No, it's not.
[312:55.70]No, it's not.
[312:56.08]No, it's not.
[312:56.42]No, it's not.
[312:56.66]That's what I have to say to that.
[313:11.30]Do I have any complaints?
[313:14.56]Um... Yeah.
[313:17.32]Yeah, there is like one major complaint about Vegas.
[313:21.96]People around here is the only complaint I really have.
[313:27.04]I love everything about Las Vegas and this portion of Nevada especially.
[313:32.58]But people drive around here like fucking lunatics.
[313:39.39]Fucking lunatics.
[313:41.41]And that's not just like a rumor meme.
[313:44.59]Unfortunately, like sad and horribly enough,
[313:49.29]I have seen more horrendous car crashes on the roads out here than ever, ever, ever before in any place I've ever been.
[313:57.75]There is a terrible fucking car wreck on the street in Vegas once a week, it seems.
[314:04.47]Like, we'll just be driving around.
[314:05.87]And it's like, oh, there's another, like, car fucking wreck over there.
[314:10.60]It's horrible.
[314:16.57]And Massachusetts, that was like maybe once every, once a year, once every maybe couple years, driving around every day, would you see a really bad pileup.
[314:29.56]It's a bi-weekly experience out here.
[314:35.26]So, just gotta be careful on the roads, Vin.
[314:37.02]That's why the insurance, insurance is high out here.
[314:39.62]Just because it's, people are fucking driving around like crazy people out here.
[314:46.65]That's the entire West Coast in general.
[314:48.85]Maybe!
[314:49.84]This is my first experience with it.
[314:59.50]Just don't leave your house.
[315:03.72]Have you been on the New York New York roller coaster?
[315:05.49]I have.
[315:07.65]It's pretty awesome, actually.
[315:12.73]Yeah, but we've been very careful when we drive around out here.
[315:16.86]Just because it's wild.
[315:20.48]But, no, no, that's probably it.
[315:22.36]That's the only real complaint that I've really had since being here.
[315:27.46]Thank you, Jamie.
[315:28.97]KW for $5.
[315:30.19]They say Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100.
[315:32.29]Hi, Jerma.
[315:32.73]Love you.
[315:32.91]Thank you so much.
[315:46.07]What kind of car do I drive?
[315:48.31]I drive a Hummer.
[315:53.04]It's the XXL version.
[315:59.46]And I put like the seat up really high and I like fucking... I love just being like big on the road.
[316:15.78]No, I don't drive a Hummer.
[316:17.24]Hummers are the types of cars that you fill that gas tank.
[316:22.00]And if you drive to the grocery store, you use half a tank of gas.
[316:36.25]He probably drives a 2010 Toyota.
[316:37.47]I do not.
[316:38.17]I do not.
[316:42.42]What a little mystery what my car is.
[316:44.94]What kind of car do I drive?
[316:46.64]What a mystery this is for you guys.
[316:48.39]Maybe one day you'll find out.
[316:52.41]What do I drive for a car?
[316:57.77]Hmm.
[316:57.91]It's not a Tesla.
[317:02.56]A clown car.
[317:07.98]I bet it's a Honda.
[317:12.60]No, I'll tell you what I drive.
[317:15.20]I drive... You ready?
[317:19.99]I'll tell you the brand.
[317:25.67]I drive a Toyota Prius.
[317:36.90]That is also not true.
[317:38.62]I do not drive a Prius.
[317:41.27]That's a 100% why.
[317:42.68]I drive a Honda Civic.
[318:08.83]Also not true.
[318:10.79]I'm just doing this thing where, I think somebody already said it, whatever car I say, people are just going to be laughing.
[318:18.93]Doesn't matter what it is.
[318:23.38]Doesn't matter what car it is.
[318:24.54]Okay, guys, I drive, I drive, I'll be honest, I drive, I drive a BMW 3 Series.
[318:42.44]By the way, one of those is true.
[318:47.52]You'll never know which one it is!
[318:51.08]Hey, tell me two truths and a lie.
[319:04.94]Tell me two truths and a lie.
[319:06.92]Tell me three truths.
[319:09.20]No, tell me... No, I don't have two cars.
[319:12.00]Tell me three lies and a truth.
[319:14.40]Or tell me four lies and none of them are true.
[319:17.92]Damn, would you guys like to find out?
[319:23.24]Three truths.
[319:23.94]You got a huge garage with like four cars.
[319:28.86]None of that.
[319:29.20]That could all be bullshit.
[319:30.72]And you would never know.
[319:31.42]I just want to know the truth.
[319:34.28]Maybe one day I'll reveal it.
[319:35.62]I'll do a car reveal.
[319:38.18]One day.
[319:41.88]But we're at the end here.
[319:44.47]No, we're not.
[319:44.89]That's a lie.
[319:45.37]Huh.
[319:46.33]Five truths and a lie.
[319:47.78]Five lies.
[319:49.90]Thank you, official.
[319:52.71]Crown on the head for the 250.
[319:54.23]If you continue to say that this account is not official, we will add a count of first-degree slander in addition to copyright infringement.
[320:03.50]Although if you publicly state how delicious the last sandwich was you ate from one of our fine establishments, we may be able to drop that charge.
[320:11.68]Well, I'll tell you, the last time I ate a sandwich from a restaurant that you may or may not be referring to, I cannot confirm or deny what you're asking.
[320:21.67]It was very good.
[320:24.05]It tasted very, very good.
[320:40.92]Tell us the sandwich.
[320:41.76]Alright, okay, fine.
[320:42.58]Okay, but what... It was... The Baconator.
[320:52.80]No, it wasn't.
[320:53.28]That's not it.
[320:57.66]It was a stacker.
[321:04.25]No, wouldn't you?
[321:05.05]You would like to know what it was, wouldn't you?
[321:10.67]What kind of sandwich that I drive?
[321:14.43]You'd really love to have that information.
[321:17.98]Could be a... Could be Big Mac?
[321:21.20]Hmm.
[321:21.32]Hmm.
[321:29.09]What kind of car he eats.
[321:31.05]Thank you, though.
[321:31.59]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer.
[321:32.91]$2.50 from Garfield.
[321:34.97]Buckle yourselves in, boys and girls.
[321:36.75]It's time for the final Garfograph.
[321:38.55]Final, wait, final Garfograph.
[321:46.68]What is this?
[321:47.08]This can't be real.
[321:49.56]It's been quite a journey, Jerm, with me.
[321:52.53]Talking about Odie and other cartoon happenings.
[321:55.13]You getting bricked, fumed as you read every single one.
[321:59.89]Me only paying you 25 cents to read a wall of text.
[322:03.54]You laughing one out of ten of them.
[322:06.18]Good times, good memories.
[322:11.12]I think it's about time Garfield buries this hatchet once and for all.
[322:15.34]Garfield be but a memory to the germs.
[322:17.20]Thanks for all the laughs, Jerma.
[322:18.35]Never stop killing those Mondays.
[322:26.25]But who will you become?
[322:27.69]But who will you become?
[322:28.61]We need to know the... the... the... take the... the bail off.
[322:33.75]We need to know who the... the... the... who's behind the mask.
[322:38.66]Garfield.
[322:39.34]$2.50 from Garfield.
[322:40.10]Here we go.
[322:41.32]Let's see who the... who's behind the mask.
[322:43.98]Thank you for the $2.50 again.
[322:46.30]Hold on.
[322:47.12]I'm not back.
[322:47.70]I just dropped my pen on the floor.
[322:50.31]Ah, you know us cats.
[322:51.63]No pockets and all that.
[322:54.05]Okay, this is the final Garfagraph, at least giving constant Garfagraphs.
[322:59.49]I might, like, pop in every year or so, I don't know.
[323:01.73]Don't stop believing all you germs in chat.
[323:04.97]I might even come back one day, who knows.
[323:07.33]Does any other cartoon germabit donators make yourself known?
[323:10.24]Remember that Robot Jones guy?
[323:12.70]He gave, like, two bits that one time.
[323:14.66]Don't forget to update the Jerma Wiki.
[323:20.26]Constant Garfagraphs, constant conflict.
[323:27.29]Well, if this is for real, Garfield, you've been a hell of a contributor to the community.
[323:35.65]If you're retiring the name, hopefully you're not leaving the community.
[323:44.26]But if you have some things going on that make it so you can't participate as often in streams, then whatever it is, I wish you the best of luck.
[323:52.12]Thank you so much for your awesome, awesome contributions.
[324:01.53]Hell yeah, Garfield.
[324:02.29]Thank you.
[324:10.05]Hope you're still here under another username.
[324:11.66]Yeah.
[324:13.46]Definitely.
[324:16.08]And that's my time.
[324:19.00]Have a good week, everybody.
[324:21.58]I will update the sus... early... probably... I don't know exactly when I will be back in this chair.
[324:32.15]It's going to be at least a week.
[324:35.78]Six days, probably.
[324:37.70]One, two, three, four.
[324:39.48]Maybe less than that.
[324:40.46]It depends.
[324:41.58]Keep an eye on the sus.
[324:42.50]You will see.
[324:43.10]You'll know.
[324:44.84]Thank you for participating in the movies streams.
[324:56.41]Have Kim stream.
[324:57.27]Kim is coming with me.
[324:59.69]We are both going back.
[325:03.74]Etalyx is gonna hold the fort down here.
[325:06.40]He's gonna take care of Otto for us while we go back.
[325:14.98]But yeah, I'll see you soon.
[325:19.61]Don't forget about me, because I won't forget about you.
[325:23.47]Good night, guys.
[325:27.11]See you real soon.
[325:28.47]Have a great week.
[325:31.96]Ta-ta.
[325:52.13]Thank you.
