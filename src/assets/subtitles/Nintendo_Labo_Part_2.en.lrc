[00:01.97]Hello, family.
[00:05.06]How you doing?
[00:08.18]Today, we're back in the Labo.
[00:12.00]Still have three more kits to make in the... Is it called kits?
[00:18.14]Three more devices to make in the variety kit.
[00:27.05]Sure, why not?
[00:27.63]Yeah, sure.
[00:28.13]Build the robot.
[00:29.09]This thing was $70.
[00:32.78]The robot kit was 80 bucks.
[00:36.12]I want to get my money's worth.
[00:37.48]I'm not just going to skip three of the creations.
[00:40.02]It's not going to happen.
[00:42.60]Like, oh, you made the piano.
[00:43.88]Now fucking fuck off to the goddamn robot.
[00:46.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[00:47.44]That would be, that was like a $30 experience.
[00:49.90]I want the full $60 thing.
[00:54.08]The robot kit takes ages.
[00:55.58]Yeah, well, I'm going to get the, the robot kit will do like a 10 hour stream.
[01:00.01]At some point in like a week or two.
[01:01.41]After tonight,
[01:02.97]We're gonna do something else for a few streams.
[01:05.65]We'll go back to the Labo probably next weekend.
[01:09.22]So, it's gonna take a long time.
[01:11.58]But, for the purposes of what we're doing right now... How the heck are you?
[01:15.92]Uh, you're probably noticing... Hold on.
[01:18.82]Hold on a second.
[01:21.04]Uh, yeah, there is a little bit of a... You might hear a little hum in the background.
[01:45.26]How long have I been muted for?
[01:46.18]Have I been muted the whole time?
[01:56.01]No, it was like one minute.
[01:58.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:58.83]Hold on.
[01:59.05]I gotta fix this.
[01:59.61]Because I fucked it up.
[02:02.67]Alright, here we go.
[02:06.63]Where is it?
[02:06.93]There you are.
[02:11.26]Okay, hold on.
[02:11.76]There we go.
[02:14.40]So, I got a fan in here now.
[02:17.04]There was a dehumidifier in here blowing on me.
[02:19.52]But I had to, it's too loud, so I had to take it off.
[02:21.96]There was like a cup of water in that thing.
[02:23.57]It's awful down here.
[02:24.63]I don't have any AC down here.
[02:26.49]And I have AC in the rest of my house, but not in this one fucking quadrant.
[02:32.19]Don't even, don't be like me.
[02:33.43]Don't do that.
[02:36.61]But there's the fan.
[02:38.90]Can you hear that?
[02:39.46]Is that coming up badly on the microphone?
[02:41.50]Is that picking up?
[02:44.14]Just stream upstairs.
[02:48.36]All my shit's down here.
[02:50.24]I have a huge desk down here.
[02:51.88]I got my computer, all my monitors.
[02:53.83]I'm not just going to bring this upstairs.
[02:57.31]That's like, no.
[02:57.73]I don't even have an Ethernet port upstairs.
[03:01.43]I can't even connect my modem to my computer upstairs.
[03:05.51]Unless I get like a 70 foot long ethernet cable and drag it through my whole house.
[03:11.13]Clean the table?
[03:13.27]You mean right there?
[03:13.95]Is this what you're looking at?
[03:16.27]Oh shit, the title sucks too, hold on, I gotta change that.
[03:21.42]They're like 30 bucks, but aesthetically, I don't want a giant ethernet snake going into my, you don't know how my, look, look.
[03:28.96]You don't know how my house is laid out.
[03:30.72]So don't give me feng shui advice when you don't even know what my fucking house looks like.
[03:35.70]Well, just bring it upstairs.
[03:36.72]You don't even know the feng shui in my house.
[03:40.18]You don't know?
[03:40.58]I could live in a fucking studio with a bathroom right here.
[03:44.34]You wouldn't even have any idea.
[03:49.33]You don't know how big this house is?
[03:50.85]Where's this shit gonna go?
[03:55.17]My chakras are all messed up.
[03:56.77]It's alright.
[03:57.27]I'll re-chakra them.
[03:59.18]Alright, I'm gonna put up a better title.
[04:01.78]How about, um...
[04:04.47]How about, yeah, fold gold.
[04:05.95]Fold gold pretzels.
[04:07.99]No, I can't.
[04:08.61]That's illegal.
[04:10.35]Fold gold.
[04:10.87]That's all it is.
[04:16.18]The one room is your whole house.
[04:17.96]You guys don't even know.
[04:19.10]I could sleep on the ground over here and you guys wouldn't even know.
[04:24.71]Do a tour video?
[04:25.61]No, I don't want you to see my house.
[04:27.97]That's weird to me.
[04:29.11]I don't want you to know this.
[04:31.27]I don't want you to know the gold shit that I have.
[04:33.49]My house is painted in gold.
[04:36.32]Some people pick, oh, let's do gray.
[04:38.42]No, no, no.
[04:38.92]I melted gold bars down, and I painted the walls in my house gold.
[04:42.30]I don't want you to know that.
[04:43.36]That's embarrassing to people that... Alright.
[04:47.39]I got my Dunkin'.
[04:48.07]Chuck got my Dunkin' Cheeto.
[04:50.23]What are we going to start with?
[04:51.75]First of all, make
[04:56.33]So we've got RC car, house, and motorbike left.
[05:00.65]What do you say we do a poll?
[05:02.20]See what we're gonna do.
[05:03.60]No, there's no joke incoming.
[05:05.58]The last Labo stream was like, I'm gonna... This is getting wet.
[05:09.98]I need like a separate table for this.
[05:12.34]See how humid it is in here?
[05:14.55]Look at that.
[05:15.69]Look at how humid it is in here.
[05:16.73]You can see the sweat coming off this.
[05:18.19]Look at the humidity.
[05:21.67]What the fuck, man?
[05:22.59]Look at how humid it is in here.
[05:28.21]Alright, we'll fuck it, I'll just put it there.
[05:30.19]Alright, straw pole.
[05:36.53]Straw poles, we got RC car.
[05:41.25]These are all, these shouldn't probably, I don't think this is gonna take that long.
[05:44.14]I've said that before.
[05:44.94]So RC car, house, and motorbike.
[05:56.50]Take a vote.
[05:57.30]Take a vote while I get it all over here.
[06:00.56]Please vote on that poll.
[06:01.60]Hopefully you can see it.
[06:02.36]I already made the piano.
[06:07.68]Everyone was so concerned about that piano when I threw it over there.
[06:11.59]It's like, oh, what the fuck?
[06:13.79]It's like, dude, the thing's not made out of glass.
[06:16.43]It's made out of cardboard.
[06:17.81]I put it back together and you saw me tweet out that picture.
[06:19.91]The thing's in beautiful condition.
[06:21.91]I could resell that on eBay and make full price.
[06:27.79]Okay, we're doing the RC car?
[06:33.15]It was broken?
[06:33.85]It's still, I was using it upstairs.
[06:40.05]Scam, scam, scam, alright.
[06:42.75]I think RC car is winning.
[06:43.87]Let me just get it all over here.
[06:44.75]I don't have any more trash bags down here, so alright, here we go.
[06:55.68]And yes, I got a dumb thing in my hair because it's so hot down here.
[06:57.98]My hair just like turns to dust.
[06:59.52]It's going to fall out eventually.
[07:03.31]Alright, here we go.
[07:04.99]I can't, my coffee shit is right here.
[07:06.73]Hold on.
[07:07.05]Alright, looks like we're doing the RC car.
[07:13.91]This thing fell out.
[07:15.01]It fell out.
[07:15.63]I had a rubber band in my hair.
[07:16.85]I got to re-put it in.
[07:17.56]Hold on.
[07:21.60]So while you continue to vote, I don't do this shit every day.
[07:24.74]I swear to God I don't.
[07:26.08]People think, oh, he's putting his hair up in like a bun.
[07:28.02]I don't do that.
[07:29.02]I'm only doing it because of the humidity.
[07:31.09]That's it.
[07:31.79]That's the only reason why you're seeing me do this.
[07:36.71]It's like 88% humidity today.
[07:40.53]That's the only reason why you see this.
[07:41.51]I don't even know how to do it.
[07:45.61]I have no idea how to do it.
[07:46.41]It's going to haphazardly be up there.
[07:55.52]Alright, that's good enough.
[07:56.38]I don't care.
[07:56.78]We're doing the RC car.
[08:01.00]Thank you for voting.
[08:02.31]RC car it is.
[08:06.43]Humidity in Boston right now is 59%.
[08:07.61]Yeah, 80 fucking 5%.
[08:08.07]That's what I said.
[08:09.87]Flip it around.
[08:10.35]95%.
[08:10.37]Alright, RC car it is.
[08:11.11]Let's go.
[08:20.48]I want to turn that stupid music down, by the way.
[08:23.58]It was eight and a half hours of fucking music.
[08:26.51]This, like, weird cartoon clown music.
[08:29.51]I'm turning it down.
[08:31.35]That's better.
[08:31.79]Alright, Toy-Con RC car.
[08:34.59]I need... What do I need?
[08:38.20]It's going real fast.
[08:41.22]Making the Toy-Con RC car.
[08:45.04]There are two steps to complete.
[08:46.16]That's it.
[08:46.42]We're going to be done in ten seconds.
[08:52.17]Clown, turn it up.
[08:53.29]No, I'm not going to turn it up.
[08:54.65]It sucks.
[08:55.65]You don't want to hear this for the whole stream.
[08:57.41]Trust me.
[08:59.99]So step one of two, what do we need?
[09:01.21]Making the RC car and antenna.
[09:05.68]Two parts from sheet A. So this is sheet A. Let's put the rest of this down here.
[09:10.22]I just needed this one sheet so far.
[09:14.48]Okay.
[09:16.40]Streamer doesn't listen to viewers.
[09:17.70]What do you mean doesn't listen to viewers?
[09:20.65]Turn on...
[09:28.00]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[09:30.90]You guys don't want to, you really want to hear this.
[09:38.84]Can you see it?
[09:40.76]Don't make me bring the wine back out today.
[09:44.18]Oh, and by the way, you thought I was fucking around?
[09:45.67]Hold on.
[09:49.43]Everybody thought I was joking around with this one.
[09:52.05]No, I don't kid around here.
[09:56.15]No, it's too late.
[09:56.75]I don't care.
[09:57.65]Alright, remove these two pieces.
[09:58.81]So we got these two.
[10:00.81]So it looks like the big frayed out... Okay, that's the frog with his legs out like this.
[10:07.23]Right here.
[10:12.04]Can you guys like see that?
[10:14.04]Do I need to like increase the focus on this?
[10:16.74]Will they like drop the resolution or something?
[10:25.20]It's because of the way the sun's going down right now.
[10:27.80]Once the sun is down completely, I'll fix it.
[10:31.91]I'll get it there, don't worry.
[10:35.23]Clown music needed.
[10:36.59]You already got clown music.
[10:40.25]Color's a little faint.
[10:41.21]Yeah, I'll... I can probably get... I can probably help that out.
[10:46.15]Okay, there's that.
[10:48.29]Let me just see what I can do about this right now.
[10:52.19]You guys need more color.
[10:57.03]How does this look?
[11:08.25]Can you see it better now?
[11:12.41]Is the color popping a little more?
[11:13.71]What about the... It's exactly the same.
[11:23.99]Well, we're just going to have to wait until the sun goes down.
[11:26.03]This is white balance bullshit in this room.
[11:27.83]Alright, whatever.
[11:31.81]Let's get this popped up.
[11:38.33]Crank this music to the max.
[11:39.60]I'm not going to crank the music.
[11:42.46]Alright, so you guys really want me to crank.
[11:45.82]I don't want to hear that.
[11:53.29]Who the fuck wants to hear that?
[12:00.33]I don't care.
[12:00.95]I'm going against the grain here.
[12:03.80]It looks like you keep this piece in, so let's get the other one out.
[12:08.80]This left one?
[12:09.52]Dude, is my white balance all fucked up?
[12:12.11]I can't even see this.
[12:15.09]I think, no, I don't think it's you guys.
[12:16.93]I don't think it's the computer.
[12:17.71]I think it's me.
[12:18.33]I think it's you.
[12:19.57]I think it's all of us.
[12:20.39]This is very faint.
[12:21.97]It's not intended.
[12:23.87]Not the same thing.
[12:24.57]Alright, that's good.
[12:26.41]Let's make the frog.
[12:29.06]Almost went for the mouse again.
[12:30.06]I think I need to move this a little bit to the left.
[12:35.18]Yeah.
[12:37.70]Okay.
[12:39.52]Now we're in business.
[12:40.44]Let's go.
[12:45.59]The music needs to go to 11, no.
[12:47.31]The other pieces are coming in handy, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:48.93]If you have trouble building, you can use the back forward buttons together at the same time and rip up the space-time continuum.
[12:54.78]Alright, go.
[12:55.50]Alright, printing is on it, flip it around.
[13:04.46]My goodness.
[13:07.20]I'm getting fucking humidity coffee here.
[13:12.12]Don't fold the antenna.
[13:15.45]Alright, so don't fold the antenna, but fold everything else.
[13:20.30]I'm looking forward to this.
[13:21.14]I've been waiting for this for like three days, guys.
[13:25.30]Oh shit, I almost just bent the whole thing.
[13:27.60]Wait, how do I do it again?
[13:28.40]Okay, don't fold it all, just fold it like this.
[13:33.34]There we go.
[13:45.48]Nice and easy, right?
[13:46.48]Okay.
[13:47.84]Then this comes all the way up.
[13:51.16]I can feel the cracks on that one.
[13:55.52]Compact man gets banned for nudity.
[13:59.83]I'm not naked.
[14:00.59]I have pants on.
[14:02.43]Not only do I have pants on, but they are... I heard the criticisms from last stream.
[14:10.75]And we got two pairs of underwear on.
[14:13.48]I was going to do three pairs of underwear to help with the bullshit people were screaming at me for.
[14:18.74]But I don't have enough clean underwear.
[14:20.54]It's two pairs of underwear.
[14:21.46]Somebody just gave $100.
[14:23.33]Hold on.
[14:25.23]Who just gave $100?
[14:30.33]Zafan, dude, thank you for the $100.
[14:34.49]Thank you so much, dude.
[14:37.13]And I'm currently reading the bullshit in chat, so bear with me.
[14:40.00]I'm seeing it at the same time.
[14:42.65]Uh, thank you, Zafandu.
[14:44.51]And you say, just got my first ever paycheck today and decided to weigh some of it on you.
[14:49.89]In all seriousness, though, I love you and your content and I can't wait to see what you do next to keep up the good work.
[14:56.12]Thank you, Zafandu, for the 100 fucking dollars that I shower before the stream.
[15:01.68]I shower every day.
[15:03.30]So, yes.
[15:05.16]Uh, much love to you, though, dude.
[15:07.34]That's a lot of fucking money.
[15:08.23]100 bucks.
[15:11.34]Congratulations on the first ever paycheck.
[15:14.24]Take yourself out for lunch.
[15:15.84]Don't take me out for lunch.
[15:18.44]But thank you.
[15:18.86]And we're going to keep going.
[15:23.29]Two pair?
[15:23.79]What do you mean two pair?
[15:28.21]Stop touching these.
[15:29.29]I'm so fucked.
[15:30.71]Just leave them over there.
[15:32.33]Okay.
[15:32.67]What am I doing?
[15:34.13]Stop it.
[15:34.39]What's next?
[15:34.65]I have to touch them.
[15:42.86]Yeah, fold everything.
[15:43.62]I already did it.
[15:45.54]Then the little tabs over here are getting folded on both sides.
[15:53.63]There we go.
[15:57.51]Same thing on the other side.
[15:59.51]Up and over.
[16:00.78]And up and over.
[16:03.54]This guy's fucked.
[16:05.28]Whatever.
[16:08.06]I'm so happy for this fan, though.
[16:09.78]This is blowing it right into my face.
[16:14.30]Crease these four tabs, fold them neatly one at a time.
[16:18.64]Keep them up.
[16:19.24]Okay, now we're gonna build it.
[16:20.14]I can't wait for this.
[16:20.80]You know, I have people who are saying that Labo is just Legos for idiots.
[16:27.63]Good.
[16:29.45]Good, I'm happy that it's like that.
[16:33.55]This is like awesome.
[16:34.41]This is awesome to be able to know that I can build a little RC car and I don't have to sit there for 62 hours making a Death Star.
[16:43.10]no one said that oh one of my friends did and they will not be named alright let's build it so then these fold in so these come in the tabs are just interlocking make sure both tabs are on the inside oh boy alright so both tabs on the inside here like this
[17:06.55]Oh, this is a little, I know what's gonna go in here.
[17:09.65]The Hot Pocket goes in here to make it extra crispy.
[17:12.68]That's how this works.
[17:15.22]Alright, let's go.
[17:16.70]This comes up and then, okay, I can get that open.
[17:22.96]Get that out of here.
[17:28.08]What was wrong with that?
[17:29.00]Why is everybody freaking out about that?
[17:31.96]So in, up, and then the tab goes in here.
[17:37.21]Like this, play along.
[17:40.03]Same thing on the other side.
[17:43.29]Oh, dang it.
[17:47.58]OK.
[17:48.68]Same thing.
[17:50.48]Up and in.
[17:52.90]We've got ourselves a little snack holder.
[17:56.16]This one's not really going in there that well.
[18:01.90]There we go.
[18:02.84]OK.
[18:05.18]Like that, right?
[18:09.09]See?
[18:13.33]What's next?
[18:15.99]These are all in on the inside.
[18:17.27]Yes, they are.
[18:18.95]Tab goes in.
[18:21.34]Is it all the way in?
[18:22.14]Yes, it is.
[18:24.78]As you flip it over, be sure none of the six legs get bent.
[18:32.54]Now, I'm not going to do that again.
[18:34.03]Everybody thinks I'm going to do that again tonight.
[18:36.99]You think I'm going to fucking smash it?
[18:38.69]No, I didn't smash the other one either.
[18:44.33]RC car is done.
[18:45.03]That's it?
[18:45.37]Are we done?
[18:47.87]Are we ready to... How do I play this one?
[18:50.90]Move on to the antenna.
[18:53.36]Printed side face down.
[18:58.06]Like that.
[18:59.54]Fold it all up.
[19:00.24]Spin it around.
[19:03.24]He doesn't know.
[19:06.36]What do you mean he doesn't know?
[19:14.31]Theme song on the piano.
[19:15.69]No, I'm not bringing the piano back down here.
[19:18.07]I forgot about the music.
[19:20.59]So this comes up like that.
[19:23.83]That's it.
[19:26.54]Two out of two.
[19:27.40]Attaching the Joy-Con.
[19:30.66]Hold on.
[19:31.82]Let's attach the antenna to the Nintendo Switch console.
[19:38.42]This thing is gonna hold that up?
[19:41.74]Like this is making me nervous.
[19:45.82]Carefully slide each tab into the rails.
[19:53.05]Am I holding this?
[19:55.01]Hold on, what fucking side is this on?
[19:57.61]I gotta grab the switch.
[19:58.97]Hold on.
[20:03.51]Okay, so that goes in here.
[20:09.01]Like this.
[20:12.23]Am I doing that right?
[20:19.49]I'm so scared.
[20:20.65]Hold on.
[20:20.83]Where's the kickback?
[20:24.16]Isn't there like a little easel thing here?
[20:25.82]Yeah, there is.
[20:26.26]How do I open it?
[20:32.96]I don't think I need it.
[20:35.12]Turn off the screen.
[20:36.28]Let me turn off the screen.
[20:40.95]Alright, there we go.
[20:41.55]So now just push this in.
[20:46.35]So this is in there now.
[20:52.41]Carefully slide each into the rails.
[20:53.83]Okay, I did it.
[20:54.36]You know what?
[21:02.88]This is fucking pretty good.
[21:04.12]I should keep that music on.
[21:06.18]Yeah, they're both inserted.
[21:09.90]I ain't going to do that though.
[21:10.82]I'm not going to let go of this.
[21:12.20]Let's attach the Joy-Con controllers.
[21:13.94]Are you ready?
[21:15.36]Should I put this back in?
[21:16.14]Alright.
[21:18.50]Well, I can... Hold on.
[21:19.36]I'm going to do this for now.
[21:21.48]Because I don't need to hold on to this.
[21:22.84]Just a stupid piece of cardboard on it.
[21:30.40]Fool.
[21:30.72]Why am I a fool?
[21:35.88]What are you talking about?
[21:48.44]Let's attach the Joy-Con controllers left and right to the RC car.
[21:51.79]Fucking hate webcams.
[22:02.40]I hate cameras.
[22:04.04]I don't even like taking pictures either.
[22:06.24]I don't like people taking a picture of me either.
[22:07.58]I hate it.
[22:10.06]I only like it when it's like a fake thing, where I'm doing like a fucking show or a character.
[22:15.96]And this is not a show.
[22:17.60]This is a show, but this is not a real scripted show.
[22:22.02]I could be on camera and do whatever the fuck I want if there's a script involved.
[22:25.94]You put me in front and show my fucking legs and stuff, all of a sudden it's like I don't want it.
[22:32.50]Alright, let's attach this.
[22:33.36]So this has to be facing this way.
[22:38.11]Like this.
[22:39.93]Make sure the symbols match.
[22:41.29]Make sure!
[22:41.81]This flimsy piece of shit.
[22:45.17]Alright, flip over the Joy-Con.
[22:49.07]So this is matching it, so flip it over here like this.
[22:52.24]And then slide it in.
[22:55.56]Like that.
[22:57.94]Yeah, slide the rail of the Joy-Con into the slot until it reaches the thinner section.
[23:01.56]It may feel a little loose, but that's okay.
[23:04.34]Don't sue us when the thing eventually breaks.
[23:10.42]Alright, that's it.
[23:12.26]This feels very loose.
[23:14.00]A little loose is an understatement.
[23:15.26]This is very loose.
[23:19.05]Okay, so that's done.
[23:21.71]Attach the other Joy-Con.
[23:25.71]Upsy-daisy.
[23:28.61]Upsy-daisy.
[23:29.52]Okay, same deal.
[23:34.54]Slide it in.
[23:40.68]That's in.
[23:41.12]Okay.
[23:44.42]So I got my little bat wing.
[23:48.38]Just like on the other side, it's done.
[23:51.94]Yes.
[23:52.80]It looks just like that, I swear.
[23:56.58]Do the Joy-Con controllers feel a bit loose?
[23:58.29]Not to worry, that's the key to making the RC car move.
[24:02.97]What do you mean move?
[24:03.71]This thing moves?
[24:06.23]This thing's gonna move.
[24:11.61]What?
[24:15.67]The toy RC car, what does it look like to you?
[24:22.47]So wait, I can drive this?
[24:24.57]There's no wheels on here.
[24:27.11]There's no wheels?
[24:29.44]Hold on, I need this.
[24:30.16]This fucking music sucks.
[24:39.56]Okay, I'm ready to play.
[24:45.52]How does this work?
[24:46.38]Is this actually going to do this?
[24:50.75]Hold on.
[24:51.03]Let me turn that off for a second.
[24:53.79]OK.
[24:55.37]So when playing with the toy archive, it runs best on flat, smooth surfaces.
[25:14.82]You know when a fly dies in front of you?
[25:17.84]That was a fly landed, I don't know if you like swatted it or something, landed on the ground and then that's what they do.
[25:26.46]Alright, we need a flat surface.
[25:39.43]Let's go on the ground, on the ground.
[25:41.35]What's the speed it can go?
[25:42.25]Can it go faster?
[25:44.30]Oh, what's this do?
[25:47.28]Hold on, wait, that, what is that?
[25:51.00]What is this looking at?
[26:07.75]This thing has cameras in it?
[26:16.29]What the fuck?
[26:24.87]I'm naked all the time when I use this.
[26:29.78]Oh, you can make the speed go up and down.
[26:31.28]Hold on.
[26:31.72]Let's get this on the ground.
[26:34.72]Alright.
[26:35.30]Let's do a house tour.
[26:38.63]That's right.
[26:39.03]Hold on.
[26:46.14]Infrared house tour Okay, so this is the next room right let me get a good view to get a good view of this and
[27:13.92]This is just what, remember back in like the fucking late 90s, those stupid spy kits where you could build your own little spy device and like ride it around your room and oh, watch out, what's your sister up to?
[27:25.50]She's on the couch?
[27:26.44]Oh, sneak over and see, does she have a boyfriend over?
[27:30.48]God.
[27:30.82]Alright, here we go.
[27:36.57]You see it?
[27:40.13]Let's go, let's drive.
[27:46.95]Is this moving?
[27:50.39]I think it's moving.
[27:58.81]Has it moved?
[28:03.22]I don't think it's moving.
[28:04.20]What if I turn up the gas?
[28:11.92]It's moving.
[28:17.35]Alright, can we get to the fridge and grab, like, an iced tea?
[28:26.86]Hold on, wait.
[28:29.68]How do I do this?
[28:30.72]This is important.
[28:31.38]Hold on.
[28:40.41]Stay there.
[28:47.45]I got to change this a little bit.
[29:08.99]Hold on.
[29:09.37]Stay there.
[29:09.77]Come on.
[29:11.43]It's going to stay right there.
[29:19.30]Oh yeah, I'm gonna turn the lights off too.
[29:20.86]Let's see if that makes it any better.
[29:26.52]Oh shit, oh shit, almost just smashed into the... That was close.
[29:35.59]That's not gonna move, right?
[29:36.91]Just be very, very gentle.
[29:49.45]Okay.
[29:50.78]Alright.
[29:51.60]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[30:03.51]We're gonna go spy cam.
[32:26.71]Did it work?
[32:35.30]Did you guys see the fucking drink I was drinking?
[32:38.02]Did you see the fridge?
[32:50.79]Let me fix this.
[32:51.83]Hey, watch it.
[32:59.67]It was too blurry?
[33:06.41]Just dock it?
[33:07.31]Oh, hold on.
[33:07.69]I'll dock it.
[33:08.41]What happens if I dock it?
[33:09.45]It's still going to be the blurry image, though.
[33:14.93]Looks like a terrible ghost hunter show.
[33:21.39]Hold on.
[33:25.99]Yeah, see?
[33:27.31]Hold on.
[33:29.35]Can I just say no?
[33:31.59]No.
[33:32.53]You can't dock it.
[33:34.99]Unfortunately, that was the only thing we're gonna be able to see.
[33:38.84]Oh well.
[33:42.96]Oh well.
[33:45.82]Well, let's go back.
[33:47.52]I do wanna try to actually drive the thing.
[33:50.53]So give me one sec.
[33:52.67]Until I figure out how to, RC car, there it is.
[33:58.46]Yeah, sorry.
[34:00.39]Alright, the lights are, yeah, I'll turn the lights back on.
[34:10.71]Did you guys get to fly?
[34:11.65]I picked you guys up at the top of the stairs and flew you around.
[34:20.02]You guys got to fly.
[34:22.50]How was that VR experience?
[34:24.76]Oh, fuck you, thing.
[34:32.72]No lights was better.
[34:33.84]Hold on.
[34:34.66]There's so much shit over here.
[34:38.84]Stubble?
[34:39.20]Yeah, I haven't shaved in like at least two weeks.
[34:45.06]And that's because I just didn't feel like it.
[34:47.26]There's no reason.
[34:49.76]Smash the camera.
[34:53.66]Shave stream?
[34:54.40]Oh yeah, didn't I say I was going to do that?
[34:58.21]You're actually not watching this in VR?
[35:00.07]Well, how the fuck could you have seen what I was doing?
[35:07.68]Grow a beard.
[35:10.44]I'm like ripping hairs out.
[35:11.66]Who gives a shit?
[35:13.00]I need to do this, though.
[35:14.52]Alright.
[35:15.20]Let's get back to what I was doing, which was I was going to drive this on the ground.
[35:22.04]I want to see, because this is not a flat surface.
[35:23.92]This is a flat surface down here.
[35:26.58]Just don't break anything.
[35:27.64]Like right here.
[35:30.50]Let's see if I can go from here to the desk.
[35:34.04]I'm ready.
[35:34.66]Let's see if you guys can see it.
[35:46.37]I think it only works on wood.
[35:52.14]It just goes based on vibrations.
[36:23.11]OK.
[36:24.03]Well, that's the RC car.
[36:27.17]That was fun.
[36:29.27]So wait.
[36:32.67]No, it's a two player?
[36:36.18]Why are there two?
[36:37.00]Let's connect two sets of .
[36:38.16]What, do you fight for who gets to drive it?
[36:42.24]No, let's go back.
[36:42.76]I'm going to put this back in here now.
[36:48.66]Now, get this fucking thing off.
[36:49.98]I don't want this on forever.
[36:54.91]It can follow heat?
[36:59.64]Why?
[36:59.94]Alright, you guys should be able to see it now.
[37:04.60]Alright, so this thing is very easy.
[37:06.24]So this was a good first one.
[37:09.07]What was the second most voted for thing, the house?
[37:14.27]It can track your hands.
[37:15.37]I mean, I just don't think I have the right surface for this.
[37:23.82]That was cool though.
[37:25.62]We totally did the spy camp thing.
[37:27.08]That was a blast.
[37:27.98]Alright, so that's fine.
[37:32.18]Let's get this out.
[37:34.08]These just slide out of here.
[37:36.78]Like this.
[37:39.56]This one's small enough where you can actually just, I can hold onto it.
[37:44.19]Bring back the pizza box.
[37:46.17]No, we're gonna build a house.
[37:49.79]You can stay right there, sir.
[37:51.69]House.
[37:54.30]House.
[37:58.74]This looks, there's like signs and shit.
[38:00.54]This one might take a little while, but this is, I'm not in the right spot.
[38:10.09]House is trash, do the fish, I already did the fishing.
[38:12.75]We did that last time.
[38:14.21]We're finishing up the variety kit.
[38:23.12]By the way, that wasn't milk that I was drinking, that was kefir.
[38:26.02]If you've never had kefir before, it is essentially fermented milk.
[38:29.90]It's lactose-free, 99%.
[38:30.97]You should try it, it's like yogurt, it's good for you.
[38:33.01]Alright, house.
[38:35.41]Forward.
[38:39.65]This one might take a little while.
[38:40.63]There's little cars in the driveway.
[38:43.93]What's the estimated time for this?
[38:47.59]Five steps for the house.
[39:03.63]Dad gets all hurt there.
[39:05.13]I'm gonna blow through this one, don't worry.
[39:09.38]There's a third set?
[39:10.32]Yeah, there's a vehicle set coming.
[39:13.20]In September.
[39:14.44]We're gonna do it, you better believe it.
[39:15.88]Alright, step one of five.
[39:18.06]Making the main body.
[39:20.48]Remove these eight pieces from sheet A. That's the frog.
[39:29.41]On sheet A.
[39:33.30]Sheet A and B. Okay.
[39:37.42]A. F. G. A. I don't have this one.
[39:46.29]They didn't give it to me.
[39:46.93]I don't think they gave this to me.
[39:50.79]Refund.
[39:52.37]Just refund it.
[39:55.14]No, that's wrong.
[39:56.08]It's this one.
[39:57.72]A and B of this.
[40:01.70]So it's these...
[40:03.21]pieces here.
[40:04.85]Set those ones down for later.
[40:06.41]Uh, this goes away.
[40:09.63]Okay.
[40:09.97]So, the fuck are we doing here?
[40:13.47]A and B. Here's A. And here's B. These can be left on the side.
[40:22.74]So what do we need?
[40:23.86]Remove these eight pieces from A and B. We need pretty much everything.
[40:26.12]Okie dokie.
[40:33.97]There.
[40:35.35]There.
[40:36.67]Now this needs to move.
[40:39.41]You fucking dumb thing.
[40:42.11]There we go.
[40:44.04]Alright, time to build.
[40:48.42]How hot is it here?
[40:50.06]It's just hot in this room.
[40:50.90]It's just a very hot room.
[40:52.76]This is correct, right?
[40:53.76]Oh, don't... Yeah.
[40:55.54]Let's do A first.
[41:00.22]Even with the dehumidifier and, like, a fan and everything...
[41:04.61]AC just doesn't come in this room.
[41:05.75]It sucks.
[41:09.71]The other two pieces don't come out yet.
[41:11.91]I'm going to leave that.
[41:14.31]Make a little pile.
[41:17.20]This one.
[41:19.10]This pops out.
[41:22.38]And a little engine next to it.
[41:25.32]House generator.
[41:33.27]Did it get the Labo's Death Star kit?
[41:37.27]No.
[41:38.23]I look forward to the absolutely definitely advertising sponsored kits, though.
[41:43.31]They're definitely going to be a thing.
[41:46.09]You better believe it.
[41:47.65]It'll be like a Spyro the Dragon Labo set.
[41:50.51]I guarantee it.
[41:56.36]You'll be able to build Spyro in the comfort of your own home.
[42:01.18]I mean, I don't work for Nintendo or anything, but...
[42:05.97]Like, when I visited Nintendo headquarters, I walked by a room, and some guy fucking sneezed.
[42:15.09]And I knew it.
[42:16.13]I just could tell that it was going to be a Labo Spyro kit.
[42:21.45]Alright, so that's it for this one for now.
[42:29.19]This comes out.
[42:31.52]Out, out.
[42:32.52]All of it except the middle.
[42:37.42]rough with it, don't you think?
[42:39.16]Why am I being so gentle?
[42:40.22]Be rough.
[42:46.27]It's designed for you to rip it out.
[42:47.75]Actually, I don't want to be rough because this is my favorite part.
[42:50.03]I love just popping the cardboard out.
[42:52.79]Just something about it feels right.
[42:54.61]Pop that out of there.
[43:00.96]Look at that.
[43:01.58]It's a Space Invader!
[43:07.37]Whatever.
[43:10.75]This one comes out, too.
[43:15.63]Not the middle piece yet, just these ones down here.
[43:18.13]OK.
[43:23.16]Nice one, Dad.
[43:27.30]Thank you, son.
[43:29.48]I've been working on my routine.
[43:30.68]Alright, that's good.
[43:31.46]That's it.
[43:31.74]I'm going to be using those other pieces later.
[43:34.02]We got all of them.
[43:34.66]Let's just count.
[43:36.47]Make sure these are out.
[43:42.19]Lucky son.
[43:43.17]Alright, we got one, two.
[43:47.20]All the middles come out of these, right?
[43:49.60]Yeah.
[43:52.76]These are the windows for the house I'm going to absolutely assume as correct.
[43:57.36]And that music, I forgot to turn it down.
[44:00.12]I'm sorry guys, I can't have like six hours of this.
[44:04.40]I'm just going to lower it a little bit.
[44:05.86]Not by a lot.
[44:06.92]Just enough so I can not stand it.
[44:09.24]Keep it.
[44:09.60]Don't you dare.
[44:10.10]I didn't turn it off.
[44:15.14]So that's it.
[44:15.50]What about the left side?
[44:16.25]Yeah, this comes out.
[44:20.63]And this little slot.
[44:25.17]I was about to make another dad joke.
[44:27.31]It was about to come out.
[44:28.07]I'm sorry.
[44:28.59]You know what?
[44:29.01]I'm going to make it.
[44:29.47]I don't care.
[44:31.39]No, it's not even a joke.
[44:33.07]It was just going to be like a reference.
[44:36.63]You know, it's past us, I think.
[44:38.51]No, I think.
[44:39.15]I'm pretty sure it's past us, so we don't have to do it again.
[44:42.25]Alright, let's go.
[44:45.11]I was going to say something about how large the cables used to be when I first built my first computer in like the 90s.
[44:49.19]I was going to make like a motherboard cable thing here.
[44:53.53]But whatever, it's already gone.
[44:54.51]Alright, so that's good.
[45:01.14]uh this has to come out too right yeah I mean I feel like I would rather than just punch it up for me but that's no I wouldn't this just has yeah get that one out of there so that's leaves us with the top yeah all these little knobs have to come out and the bottom one here too
[45:30.34]So it looks like that.
[45:30.96]Alright, that's good.
[45:33.18]Let's go.
[45:33.52]Build the house.
[45:40.47]Oh, fuck.
[45:47.53]How long is this one going to take?

[46:36.42]No, I already did, I can't do that.
[46:38.04]This shit's too expensive just to be an asshole.
[46:42.76]If it was 10 bucks, maybe, not 70.
[46:47.33]$70, I'm not bending it as a joke.
[46:54.17]I'm making a house, if you're curious.
[46:56.73]Don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back and forward buttons.
[46:58.96]Alright, start with this piece.
[47:07.44]Stop with the print.
[47:08.54]Where is it?
[47:09.12]I don't need this yet.
[47:09.94]This is the base.
[47:11.42]Where's this one?
[47:12.54]Right here?
[47:13.62]Right?
[47:21.61]I'm unreasonably fucking upset right now.
[47:23.93]It's okay.
[47:24.29]I think that was supposed to happen.
[47:37.21]fucking tiny little desk.
[47:42.22]I'm so pissed off right now.
[47:44.30]I hope that's not going to be a problem.
[47:46.54]No, it won't.
[47:50.84]Fold along all the main fold lines.
[47:53.63]They just fold all the lines.
[47:54.65]Yep.
[47:54.85]Yep.
[47:55.05]Yep.
[47:55.21]Just make sure I can see what I need to do.
[47:56.63]Okay.
[47:58.99]Hold on.
[47:59.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:00.17]That's where the Joy-Con is going to go.
[48:01.79]So let's do some folding.
[48:07.63]He's cracking.
[48:10.01]Yeah, I'll give you a crack.
[48:15.79]Fold along the fold lines.
[48:22.14]I'm talking about drugs.
[48:23.76]I'm not going to give anybody crack.
[48:30.00]Make that same exact joke.
[48:31.42]I made that same exact joke last stream.
[48:33.76]Did I?
[48:35.96]Somebody give me a clip.
[48:37.60]want to hear it I want to see the same job I want to see it somebody get it putting us on the spot I wanted I want to see it because I'm absolutely positive they're correct that's good
[49:06.91]Get it, recycled material.
[49:10.37]Yeah!
[49:12.27]You think I can't use recycled material on a recycled material stream?
[49:17.47]You bet your ass I'm gonna do old jokes.
[49:29.72]I'm allowed to do that tonight.
[49:31.02]Is this a main fold line?
[49:35.53]Let's just do this first.
[49:38.19]Because this goes over.
[49:44.67]Finish him.
[49:46.66]Who?
[49:47.56]Me?
[49:50.06]What do you mean finish him?
[49:53.10]What are you referring to?
[49:56.08]And those flap up.
[49:58.73]Okay.
[49:58.83]Okay.
[50:02.08]What am I finishing?
[50:03.64]I can't finish this yet.
[50:04.57]This one's a labyrinth.
[50:06.95]Just wait until I take a hammer to the house at the end of the stream.
[50:10.49]That's what you all want to see anyways.
[50:11.59]Okay, that's good.
[50:19.60]That's a nice little slot.
[50:22.58]So then these two pieces then come up and then it wraps around.
[50:27.18]So then up, up, wrap around.
[50:32.55]which I need to fold these.
[50:34.20]Shit!
[50:46.66]This is really fucking flimsy.
[50:51.78]Okay, that's fine.
[50:53.08]In, up and around.
[50:57.16]Leads right into the slot.
[51:04.88]Snap it in.
[51:05.36]I already did that.
[51:06.03]One step ahead of your game.
[51:07.77]And then that goes around and then snaps in.
[51:09.75]So then this comes around.
[51:14.71]This.
[51:16.31]Didn't even fold this one either.
[51:18.00]I tried to skip steps.
[51:21.38]This doesn't look like a house.
[51:24.80]Oh, you said it does look like a house.
[51:26.38]I was about to be very upset with you.
[51:28.44]Alright, so this is where the... This is the key to the house.
[51:32.83]You go...
[51:35.59]The house opens.
[51:40.15]Alright.
[51:40.45]Carefully fold the fabs and then throw it in there.
[51:42.46]Okay.
[51:47.30]Somebody said stop talking.
[51:55.36]What do you want me to do?
[51:57.35]You want me to build this and not say anything?
[52:31.44]No, it just looks like I'm drunk doing this.
[52:33.14]No, I'm not going to lose viewers for this.
[52:36.32]One guy said that.
[52:37.04]That's the one guy.
[52:38.50]Sometimes one day it's going to be you.
[52:43.17]I'm shit-faced trying to figure out how to do this.
[52:46.03]Silent Labo drunk stream would be... I think I would actually want to watch that.
[52:51.55]I think that would be funny.
[52:54.58]Alright, so let's go fold all these creases.
[53:00.59]Just give a guy a bottle of liquor and then be like, go.
[53:03.69]But you're not allowed to talk.
[53:05.85]And if you talk, then the prize money is deleted.
[53:10.83]Oh, and you don't get any instructions.
[53:14.45]You build that whole house, you get five grand.
[53:22.04]I just heard a bug in here.
[53:24.54]And then goes up.
[53:27.06]So then this slides in.
[53:28.89]Watch carefully to make sure you put it in the right way.
[53:31.95]Slide the chimney all the way through.
[53:33.33]That's the chimney.
[53:34.29]So it goes like this.
[53:36.99]This goes in.
[53:41.24]Slide the chimney all the way through.
[53:43.04]And then it's going to go.
[53:47.84]OK, so wait till it goes.
[53:48.60]Not quite.
[53:58.29]That looked easier on the program.
[54:00.11]It's like too fat.
[54:09.48]There we go.
[54:10.68]Not really, but kind of.
[54:13.70]It's like too big.
[54:18.00]There we go.
[54:18.66]Alright.
[54:19.98]Now let's see if we can get it to do the snap here.
[54:22.69]This is going to feel so good.
[54:23.71]Ready?
[54:32.10]Then the tabs come down or no?
[54:38.64]Alright, time for the two stopper pieces that will hold it in place.
[54:43.28]I can't do this in the same way.
[54:49.84]Ow!
[54:52.84]Fold in half.
[54:56.76]Fold in half.
[55:01.35]Spot it to the left of the fan.
[55:05.43]Ah!
[55:05.51]Is that what you want?
[55:09.91]So now these are going into the gap here on the bottom of both sides.
[55:16.99]Okay, just like this.
[55:19.82]Stick it right in here, slide it in.
[55:24.48]Ah, that felt good.
[55:25.82]Same thing on the other side.
[55:26.60]There's a little gap there, I can see.
[55:32.58]Nice.
[55:32.90]Okay.
[55:34.46]So that's done.
[55:38.06]Paint your window sill.
[55:39.10]I refuse.
[55:41.32]Did you get him to meet in the middle?
[55:42.40]I did.
[55:44.36]Ugh.
[55:47.45]Okay, now the house will really start to take shape.
[55:49.25]This piece is going to form the floor.
[55:51.35]Be sure to crease and fold the floor.
[55:53.29]Put this away for now.
[55:56.83]Oh shit, the fucking condensation is getting on the stickers.
[56:14.96]That's fine.
[56:20.12]He's not even halfway through.
[56:23.15]We're just... Man, this is going to take a while, man.
[56:25.19]We're just kind of hanging out.
[56:27.43]I love these streams because it gives me an opportunity just to hang out and shoot the shit with you guys.
[56:31.87]When do we get this opportunity?
[56:34.67]Usually I'm like...
[56:36.05]Like zoning in, like headshot, headshot, 25 points.
[56:39.69]Jump, parkour, grab, get the guy, cut his head off, right?
[56:42.47]Like I'm, usually I'm really fucking paying attention.
[56:49.57]This is my opportunity to hang out and say hello.
[56:55.48]That never happens though.
[56:56.52]I don't know what stream you've been to.
[57:00.14]I usually do pretty well.
[57:01.16]Do you ever think he's cool?
[57:09.02]I don't think I'm cool.
[57:09.94]I think I'm damn cool.
[57:14.60]Alright, what was that big piece?
[57:17.46]There it is.
[57:20.80]This one.
[57:22.35]So fold it all up.
[57:24.65]So it goes like this.
[57:25.85]Fold everything.
[57:28.37]One, two, three.
[57:29.25]All the creases right?
[57:30.13]Yeah, everything.
[57:31.71]I gotta be careful.
[57:32.15]This one has little thin little arms though.
[57:34.63]So be careful here.
[57:40.12]One wrong bend and I think this could be a disaster.
[57:44.72]Damn, look at that suit I'm talking about.
[57:46.30]Be really careful.
[57:51.86]What a master at work.
[57:54.12]If I'm so cool, why do I need a fan?
[58:00.40]Well, because you're talking temperature-wise, not, you know, person factor.
[58:11.29]What's that new show on ABC?
[58:13.05]You've got the person factor.
[58:15.05]You've got it.
[58:18.49]And all these come up.
[58:20.79]Damn, look at this little guy, come on.
[58:30.87]It was an X factor joke.
[58:32.39]Do you guys not know TV?
[58:37.05]Stop trying to stay in touch with the kids.
[58:38.45]Well, I have to try and stay in touch with the kids.
[58:42.61]Why do you think I'm folding up cardboard?
[58:44.45]I need to make sure the kids know that I know what I'm talking about and that I'm fun and cool.
[58:59.12]What's that?
[58:59.90]Okay.
[59:00.26]All of them come up, right?
[59:09.48]Thank you for what?
[59:10.68]What is it?
[59:13.41]Shut up and fold that cardboard.
[59:14.93]I'm trying to.
[59:16.39]There's a lot of small little nuanced folds here.
[59:25.16]There's a lot of little guys.
[59:26.72]Like these ones.
[59:30.42]Just fold.
[59:31.06]I'm doing it.
[59:32.20]This is as fast as I can go without breaking it.
[59:35.13]This thing can break.
[59:38.80]Guys, I don't want to break it.
[59:39.96]That defeats the entire purpose of this whole stream.
[59:43.72]Is breaking it before it's done.
[59:45.30]Once it's done, go ahead and smash it.
[59:47.38]But not before then.
[59:48.64]Not a second before then.
[59:53.55]Don't you understand?
[59:56.51]That's what the animal kingdom does.
[59:59.29]They find their prey.
[60:01.11]They grab their prey.
[60:02.15]They bring the prey back.
[60:03.17]And then they fucking smash it and rip it up and eat it.
[60:05.56]They don't do that before.
[60:06.32]They don't eat it before they bring it back to the cave.
[60:09.79]You name me one tiger that brings its prey back to the cave and eats it beforehand.
[60:23.74]Alright, they're all folded up.
[60:26.14]Tony the Tiger.
[60:26.78]That's a made-up fucking cereal guy.
[60:30.83]What they don't tell you is Tony the Tiger eats the people in the commercial.
[60:36.84]You know, you got the guy, like the fitness guy, that's like, oh, man, I love Frosted Flakes.
[60:39.88]They're so great.
[60:41.22]Tony's like, oh, yeah, that's right.
[60:42.48]They're great.
[60:43.78]And when they're done, it's cut.
[60:45.64]He fucking mauls the guy.
[60:47.24]And then that's how he gets paid.
[60:48.75]What do you think?
[60:52.07]He eats cereal?
[60:52.91]He's a tiger.
[60:53.57]Okay.
[60:59.91]We need little stickies.
[61:02.58]Sponge stickers.
[61:03.32]I got it right here.
[61:09.37]Yeah, they're all exactly the same.
[61:10.25]I got two.
[61:12.03]Now we're gonna stick one half of the sponge sticker on either side of the piece.
[61:14.89]Make sure the print side is face down.
[61:16.17]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:19.04]So we need to go right in these two spots here.
[61:26.64]Okay, here's one little sticky.
[61:28.20]Right in the middle, kind of on the side a little bit.
[61:35.55]Looks like it's right on the edge.
[61:39.91]It's a little sloppy, but I got it.
[61:41.24]It's a little sloppy, but don't worry.
[61:44.20]This corner bent.
[61:46.68]I'm just going to return it.
[61:49.06]The corner was already bent before I got it.
[61:50.50]There we go.
[61:57.55]Okay.
[61:58.35]Both on.
[61:58.83]Hold on.
[62:01.03]Let me turn this.
[62:04.79]I couldn't see what you guys were saying.
[62:10.08]Okay, this is time to go.
[62:11.24]And there's like hair in it.
[62:13.52]Whatever, I don't even care anymore.
[62:14.76]It's out of my face now.
[62:15.64]It's been like parted.
[62:17.38]So who cares?
[62:18.06]No, it's not.
[62:18.46]It was a lie.
[62:20.14]Alright, what's next?
[62:22.04]Stickies are on there.
[62:25.41]And then next we need the marker stickers.
[62:28.91]So these things.
[62:34.81]Okay.
[62:36.61]So the top corner here.
[62:39.82]These are longer ones.
[62:44.92]Okay, here we go.
[62:46.87]So top right corner, it's gonna go up there.
[62:49.75]Why do we need these markers?
[62:54.37]Oh, this is the security system.
[62:56.79]This is ADT.
[63:03.30]Right on the edge, right in the corner.
[63:06.14]Look at how fucking hunched over my neck is.
[63:09.99]Okay, let me get it.
[63:11.95]I could move the rest of my body.
[63:13.35]Why am I doing an ostrich?
[63:14.53]Okay.
[63:22.57]Same thing on the other side.
[63:27.63]Same thing on the other side.
[63:28.71]This.
[63:41.01]Is that OK?
[63:43.89]Now what do we do?
[63:45.13]More stickers.
[63:46.49]Or is that it?
[63:49.21]Fold the edges of the window firmly inward.
[63:53.05]Jesus Christ.
[63:56.47]Firm.
[63:59.15]Firm.
[63:59.77]Hard.
[64:00.45]Here we go.
[64:02.25]Something's going to go in here.
[64:03.05]Am I going to actually make a functioning door?
[64:10.87]Can't wait for the Garfield Labo kit.
[64:12.39]Is that coming out?
[64:14.15]I can't wait to talk shit about it before it releases.
[64:16.81]Alright, that's good.
[64:19.31]Flies up, we're good.
[64:20.27]Okay, just making sure.
[64:26.63]All of them right.
[64:28.91]Do it to all of them.
[64:33.34]Alright, so here's a quick little, not a poll, but just a quick little how we doing.
[64:40.49]Would you rather me fold labos?
[64:45.51]What you're doing now, would you rather see this again or me sitting in front of the camera with a comb?
[64:54.36]What would you rather see?
[64:57.04]Be honest.
[65:03.36]I'm seeing a lot of Labo here.
[65:08.87]It's too bad that there's no comb in this kit.
[65:15.92]You have two hands.
[65:19.38]No, that's not going to work.
[65:21.50]That's not going to work.
[65:23.36]The RC car is a comb.
[65:25.58]I don't want to break it because I want to impress my girlfriend later.
[65:30.76]She'll be like, hey, watch this.
[65:33.20]And I'm going to put it on the ground.
[65:34.54]It's going to go, and she's going to go, oh.
[65:40.52]And I'm going to be, I made that.
[65:42.00]I did that.
[65:45.57]OK, that's that.
[65:48.79]Now time to lift the floor and the walls together again.
[65:51.99]Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
[65:54.86]Time to put the floor and walls together.
[65:58.76]Up and then snap.
[66:00.24]Up and then snap.
[66:03.40]It's not really bent that well.
[66:07.83]This.
[66:09.89]Walls come up, snap it in.
[66:15.88]Nice.
[66:17.24]Same thing on the other side.
[66:20.60]Why did somebody just laugh?
[66:24.85]Somebody just laughed.
[66:25.75]Just laughed.
[66:26.65]Why?
[66:27.43]What did I do?
[66:27.75]What happened?

[67:23.27]Alright, I gotta, I gotta, let's reel it back.
[67:28.65]Alright, flip it around.
[67:34.68]Like that.

[67:41.08]Got it.
[67:44.19]Very confused Jerma.
[67:45.73]I'm not confused.
[67:48.53]I see so clearly.
[67:49.57]I've been drinking this tea that some guy gave me in an alley.
[67:56.31]It's giving me such clarity.
[68:03.74]These have to pop out.
[68:05.88]Do they pop out?
[68:08.56]Yeah, they do.
[68:11.54]Pop out the little pieces here.
[68:15.54]No, come on.

[69:21.82]Alright, take the whole piece and slot it in.
[69:24.06]I'm ready.
[69:27.95]Comedy license revoked?
[69:29.17]No, that was a deliberate comedy license revoking joke.
[69:33.71]I was making a point.
[69:38.30]Snap, and this has to go all the way down, right?
[69:43.14]The whole thing snaps on, okay.
[69:44.46]So here, in.
[69:47.95]That's in.
[69:49.75]Ooh, I can't wait to live here.
[69:51.11]It's gonna be so much fun.
[69:55.34]Hopefully, there's a bug on my neck and I don't even know what it is.

[73:09.93]I'm not gonna mod that guy.
[73:17.53]Let's just skip this, cause I already know.

[73:22.20]R to R, same deal.
[73:23.18]Yep, yep, yep.
[73:23.96]Just fold it, fold it, fold it.
[73:27.59]Hydrate.
[73:28.07]I've got a coffee right here.
[73:30.19]I've been drinking it.
[73:33.97]Hydration is, you don't have to, alright, you don't just wait like three hours and then slam a bottle of water.
[73:42.89]I am drinking something over the course of the, all day I've had coconut water, I've had water, I've had coffee.
[73:52.68]Coffee dehydrates you.
[73:55.66]But I've had all the shit.
[73:56.52]Like, I'm just sitting here.
[73:57.42]It's been like an hour and 15 minutes.
[73:59.16]It's not like I've been sitting here for four days.
[74:02.26]I'm not, like, turning to dust.
[74:04.89]Like... I've only had one sip of fucking liquid in four days, guys.
[74:11.43]What's that?
[74:11.79]What's that?
[74:12.39]What's that thing?
[74:13.59]Oh, a hydrate bot.
[74:14.75]Thank God you exist to save me.
[74:17.97]How would I have known if you weren't in my chat room?
[74:26.06]You said you would quit?
[74:27.66]Quit coffee?
[74:28.84]I know.
[74:29.68]I can't though.
[74:30.64]It sucks.
[74:37.98]It sucks.
[74:39.28]I cut down a lot though.
[74:41.49]I used to drink a lot of coffee.
[74:44.09]Now I only drink really one a day.
[74:45.75]I don't overdo it anymore.
[74:52.63]I can't.
[74:53.69]As much as I love drinking coffee...
[74:55.78]I'm a caffeine weirdo.
[74:57.90]I'm obsessed with it.
[75:00.89]Don't be mean to Hydrate Bot.
[75:02.37]I'm not being mean to Hydrate Bot.
[75:05.65]He serves a very good purpose.
[75:10.21]When did I say that I don't like the purpose that he serves?
[75:17.44]R to R. Get it, Nick.
[75:20.56]Slides in here.
[75:24.55]It is really easy just to kind of forget what you're doing.
[75:29.28]You know, you're getting those chicken dinners all day.
[75:32.26]You're drinking this monster.
[75:35.26]You know, it's not good.
[75:47.41]If you want it to be a thing, HydrateBot should be something on Alexa.
[75:54.34]Do I have to do that right?
[75:55.04]Let me make sure this is on there.
[75:56.10]Yeah.
[75:56.51]A little tab has to be sticking out.
[75:59.27]Which, is it over here?
[75:59.99]Yeah, it is.
[76:06.05]No, not Alexa high.
[76:07.01]Like, Alexa should tell you.
[76:09.24]You know, like, it has been four hours.
[76:10.70]In 12 minutes, you need to drink some water.
[76:13.16]And you can go, oh, thanks.
[76:13.96]Thanks, Alexa.
[76:14.60]Appreciate it.
[76:15.90]And be done with it.
[76:16.38]Alright, here we go.
[76:17.76]Now, to hoist the chimney onto the place on the top of the house, are you feeling like a real construction worker yet?
[76:25.85]sip.
[76:26.25]Let me tell you about my high cholesterol.
[76:27.95]It's not high yet.
[76:28.53]It's borderline high.
[76:33.20]So this is the chimney.
[76:34.72]That's cool.
[76:36.12]So it goes like this.
[76:39.30]Like that.
[76:45.36]And that goes, no, actually it goes like this.
[76:49.53]This is left.
[76:50.77]So then it launches onto there.
[76:54.35]Into the back.
[76:57.32]Slide the rear tab into the back wall.
[77:04.35]Did I put this on right?
[77:05.85]I did, right?
[77:07.19]No, I did.
[77:07.71]I don't think I put this on right.
[77:14.15]No, okay.
[77:14.61]I'm freaking out.
[77:15.13]I got it.
[77:18.81]This goes in here.
[77:23.24]Chimney snaps in.
[77:26.44]Alright, and then it snaps into the other two.
[77:30.52]Snap, snap, good.
[77:37.65]No, it's in, I got it, it's on there, right?
[77:38.99]I just had to make sure.
[77:40.83]We don't wanna fuck it up this close.
[77:48.57]Why is this shit wet?
[77:49.87]Does it feel wet to you guys?
[77:57.51]Hey, does this feel wet to you?
[78:01.70]Does it?
[78:06.08]A little, yeah?
[78:08.62]A little bit.
[78:09.00]Alright, that's done.
[78:11.94]House with a chimney.
[78:14.29]It looks like a gingerbread house.
[78:15.69]Don't eat it though, kids.
[78:20.45]Just one wall to go, but it's the most important one.

[80:50.38]Does the whole thing bend back?
[80:55.58]This whole thing has to go back, does it?
[80:57.10]I'm concerned.
[80:59.10]Yes, it does.
[81:02.71]Now, I wouldn't trade this for anything.
[81:05.51]Serious.
[81:08.33]I wouldn't trade this for anything.

[83:17.14]I need to pay attention.
[83:17.94]I'm not up with this like stupid joke.
[83:21.26]This goes down like this and this slides on top.
[83:26.18]I didn't even fold the tabs.
[83:27.26]Hold on.
[83:30.80]Don't worry.
[83:31.36]I'm gonna be here.
[83:42.44]He's legit going insane.
[83:43.92]I'm worried about him?
[83:44.94]Different with me?

[84:02.44]So I'm gonna get 50 bucks.
[84:03.66]Hold on.
[84:05.87]Let's take a little bit of a second break here.

[84:27.08]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks, dude.
[84:28.48]For real.
[84:31.80]This doesn't suck.
[84:32.54]I'm having a good time.
[84:33.72]I'm having a fucking good time.
[84:41.03]Are y'all having a good time here?
[84:44.85]If I see one no, I'm leaving.
[84:53.85]Alright, let's go.
[84:54.51]I need to turn the music up.
[85:02.29]No, seriously, Kilco, thank you so much, dude.
[85:05.49]Let's put the roof on now.
[85:08.56]So this slides in here.
[85:13.54]Okay, hold on.
[85:14.18]This slides underneath this shit.
[85:18.46]Like that.
[85:20.55]And it's going to come through here.
[85:23.00]and into the bottom right here.
[85:26.67]That's kind of neat.
[85:27.91]That's neat.
[85:29.25]What's this water on here?
[85:31.61]Who spilt that on here?
[85:34.77]That goes in.
[85:37.70]Spin it around.
[85:38.48]These top tabs should slide neatly into the left and right pieces, and then the other one sticks out still.
[85:44.68]And that just leaves these side tabs.
[85:46.60]Let's take them one at a time.
[85:49.01]Oh, you've got to bend them up.
[85:49.69]Okay, I get it.
[85:50.29]So spin it around.
[85:51.47]Oh, I can't see anything.
[85:53.65]Do you guys see anything?
[85:54.47]There we go.
[85:56.65]So these tabs go in here like this.
[86:00.56]You've got to get them both at the same time.
[86:09.46]I thought it was going to snap in.
[86:17.32]Oh, there we go.
[86:20.91]One more.
[86:21.97]Snap.
[86:23.27]Come on, snap in there.
[86:24.93]Nice.
[86:26.59]Whoa, what happened here?
[86:28.07]What did I do here?
[86:28.86]What happened here?
[86:30.76]Fuck, what happened here?
[86:31.60]What happened there?
[86:37.24]Shit.
[86:37.82]Come on.
[86:40.56]That needs to be down.
[86:42.73]Dammit.
[86:47.27]Oh, fuck.
[86:47.79]This isn't that tight.
[86:48.51]Here we go.
[86:54.79]Fuck me, good, there it is.
[86:57.69]Both in, alright, reconfigure that, get in there.
[87:00.73]Okay, better.
[87:06.43]These tabs, now you have to snake them out like this.
[87:10.79]So it goes up and then down and then in.
[87:14.74]Okay, so up.
[87:18.90]Up.
[87:21.94]And then down and then that goes in there.
[87:28.06]Secure same thing on this side Just grab a pair of scissors no, I can't do that that defeats the entire purpose of this whole project Alright, it's it there looks good so far what's the next step friend I
[88:00.19]What does the house even do?
[88:01.46]I don't know, maybe I go in here.
[88:05.78]Yeah, what the fuck is this even for?
[88:08.60]Am I gonna hold the camera in my mouth and shrink down and Mario into the house?
[88:13.62]This one sucks.
[88:25.35]I'm not gonna say that yet.
[88:26.49]They've all been entertaining.
[88:28.03]They all have been.
[88:29.92]Every one of these projects has actually been pretty fun.
[88:33.26]Put a little step just outside the front door.
[88:35.56]What do you mean there's no door?
[88:36.84]Use your imagination.
[88:38.42]Lazy.
[88:41.20]Lazy.
[88:46.38]This fell earlier.
[88:49.85]What is back there that you can see?
[88:51.03]Oh, I thought that was an open.
[88:53.93]No, it's not a window.
[88:54.61]Alright.
[88:57.32]There's a lot of long folds in this one.
[88:59.14]Crease them all.
[89:01.42]Okay.
[89:03.08]This pops out.
[89:04.97]Look at all these teeth here.
[89:09.77]Look at how many tiny little crease teeth there are.
[89:12.23]Fold it all.
[89:14.81]This is going to be a tube, I'm going to assume.
[89:20.14]Pay $70 to use your imagination.
[89:22.82]Yep.
[89:25.06]But I bought it.
[89:28.27]You know what I'm saying?
[89:29.21]I bought this.
[89:33.27]All, like, individually go all the way up?
[89:35.05]Yeah.
[89:36.88]Yeah, the whole thing has to roll up into a little tube.
[89:38.88]I mean, I can say whatever I want about this, but I did purchase this.
[89:46.96]I don't regret the purchase, though.
[89:48.04]That's the thing.
[89:52.75]I don't have any buyer's remorse here.
[89:58.31]one more this one I gotta flatten it a little alright now this the whole thing tubes up like this make sure I'm doing that right the whole thing rolls up and then goes in the alright hold on wait wait wait the whole thing has to roll like this
[90:28.92]into here, like that.
[90:32.81]So there it is.
[90:33.45]There are the steps.
[90:41.29]Jesus fucking Christ.
[90:51.18]Yeah.
[90:53.70]I can't even say anything.
[90:55.29]What can I say?
[90:56.73]What can I say?
[90:58.09]What can I say?
[90:58.71]So that goes and slides down the top here.
[91:08.07]Like that.
[91:08.75]So then that just goes in.
[91:11.27]Just slide it down into the middle.
[91:20.66]Snugly at the bottom.
[91:23.11]What happened down here?
[91:23.75]Okay, no.
[91:35.92]I thought it was a disaster.
[91:36.74]We're good.
[91:45.74]Okay.
[91:48.28]Toilet leak.
[91:48.98]Don't fucking say that shit.
[91:51.70]I should ban the word toilet and leak.
[91:54.82]Alright, there are the steps to the house.
[91:59.71]There's another few steps here.
[92:02.27]Bonus points if the printed marks actually line up.
[92:06.11]They do.
[92:10.10]Alright, there it is.
[92:12.74]Now for the final piece to make our house complete, it's time to add the roof.
[92:18.16]This piece here.
[92:24.98]Yeah, just fold it in half.
[92:29.19]Fold it in half and then fold those pieces in.
[92:31.71]That.
[92:37.75]Almost done with step one.
[92:41.14]Hey, you knew this was gonna be a long one.
[92:46.32]You should know that by now.
[92:52.41]Now this goes on top of here.
[92:57.95]Like that.
[92:58.81]Moment of truth, we're gonna have to fit this over the top of the chimney, keep the printed side facing up.
[93:05.45]So it goes just over the whole thing.
[93:07.21]Now slot in the tabs on both sides.
[93:13.18]Oh damn, alright.
[93:15.64]So just like this.
[93:24.02]And then into this slot, and then into this slot.
[93:33.31]That's in.
[93:33.67]Ooh, that felt good.
[93:39.45]I was just gonna scream, yeah!
[93:46.17]But I don't wanna hurt anybody.
[93:48.53]That would hurt everybody's ears.
[93:49.93]The house is complete, okay.
[93:54.85]Gonna make three special blocks that slot into the main house.
[93:57.55]You might wanna take a little break first, okay.
[94:10.56]Alright, A and B. Found it.
[94:23.12]Where do I get my coffee from?
[94:24.16]This is Dunkin' Donuts, man.
[94:25.54]It's a garbage can.
[94:27.94]I may as well just get my coffee from inside of a dumpster.
[94:33.26]A and B, okay, this little piece here.
[94:39.13]And the piece on B in the middle part.
[94:43.42]How dare you?
[94:44.70]I didn't say I'm not drinking it.
[94:47.76]I have accepted my fate.
[94:54.17]I don't like Starbucks.
[94:55.71]Starbucks is just Dunkin' Donuts, but they added $1.50 on every coffee.
[94:59.95]There we go.
[95:09.69]That's it, right?
[95:10.23]That's it?
[95:10.47]Let me move this out of the way for now.
[95:17.45]So it's going to turn into a little knob.
[95:19.21]You probably turn the water on and shit, and a little water comes on the switch, and you can watch it go out the chimney.
[95:26.19]I don't know.
[95:26.67]I don't know.
[95:27.45]I don't even know how a house works.
[95:28.93]I don't know where it goes when you go to the bathroom.
[95:31.12]When you go to a bathroom, I haven't known this since I was like 11 years old.
[95:33.46]When you take a shit in the toilet, where does it go?
[95:35.58]I don't know where it goes.
[95:37.83]It goes down into the toilet and then I don't ask any more questions.
[95:46.94]May as well be the dump fairy, for all I know.
[96:00.61]It goes to this stream.
[96:07.54]Watch yourself.
[96:09.42]Watch yourself.
[96:11.94]I'm on the lookout for you now.
[96:15.69]Watch out.
[96:16.59]I'm on the lookout.
[96:25.79]I know your chat name now.
[96:28.13]I got a button right here that goes directly to Twitch headquarters.
[96:32.33]It's a huge red button that sits on my desk and I go...
[96:37.63]And then a light lights up on one of the workers' desks.
[96:49.78]Not synced?
[96:51.42]Hold on, what?
[96:52.28]What do you mean, not synced?
[96:55.34]Wait, what?
[96:55.80]Hold on.
[97:08.92]That's synced.
[97:17.12]Alright, I got my pieces.
[97:18.00]One, two, three, four, five.
[97:20.93]Hey, you want to make a Wolverine costume for your son in like ninth grade?
[97:31.73]That's too old.
[97:32.59]Like the sixth grade?
[97:33.59]This is how you used to do it.
[97:35.75]You'd make these little things with cardboard.
[97:37.75]Did I ever tell you the story of how I wanted to be a Power Ranger and I forgot my costume?
[97:41.51]So one of the teachers made me into a ladybug and I was so fucking mad.
[97:45.85]And you know when you go out and you walk around the classrooms, every class walks around the other classrooms?
[97:52.54]I forgot I had this awesome Power Rangers costume at home.
[97:55.80]And I forgot it.
[97:58.13]The lady took red construction paper and folded it around my neck, tied it with a string, and then made me two ladybug ears, and I put it on.
[98:09.68]And I was supposed to be the Red Ranger, and we had three other kids that were in that class that were the Power Rangers, and I was a fucking cardboard ladybug.
[98:17.90]Construction paper ladybug.
[98:21.00]The mic?
[98:26.75]What are you talking about?
[98:31.48]Stop, this isn't, I didn't do anything.
[98:34.96]You guys aren't even funny with that.
[98:38.50]You wanna talk about recycled material?
[98:41.50]You guys have been recycling that shit since 2012.
[98:47.70]Let's go.
[98:48.12]Here's a pro tip, you can fast forward, how many times are they gonna tell us this?
[98:57.06]Alright, this piece right here.
[98:59.82]Lot of little folds, I got it.
[99:04.41]And it gets you every time.
[99:07.11]Well, I don't know, man.
[99:08.03]I've done shit like that before.
[99:09.45]I've had the camera off when I wanted to have it on.
[99:12.55]I've had my audio desynced for four hours playing Dark Souls before.
[99:16.16]It's happened before.
[99:17.68]So it's not against the realm of possibility that it's not going to happen again.
[99:22.60]Make a nice long box.
[99:25.52]Fold everything.
[99:27.02]And then just slot it up.
[99:30.77]Fold it all.
[99:37.18]The very beginning was muted.
[99:38.22]I know.
[99:38.60]It was.
[99:39.58]It was.
[99:40.86]I'm not going to deny that.
[99:41.70]That's why I have to check.
[99:47.13]These tiny little pieces have to come out first.
[99:48.89]I don't want to throw them over there because... Throw them over there.
[99:53.39]That'll be the designated trash part of the room.
[99:56.89]Yeah.
[99:57.29]Trash.
[99:59.81]What's this?
[100:00.07]Some trash?
[100:00.85]Trash part.
[100:01.47]Okay.
[100:04.71]Hold this little piece in.
[100:09.07]Jerma, you look great and I hope you're having fun playing with cardboard.
[100:11.43]Hey, thank you.
[100:14.94]I am having a great time.
[100:15.86]Thank you for asking.
[100:21.16]My mom told me that your dad's name was Jerma.
[100:26.42]OK.
[100:29.48]What do you want to do with that info?
[100:35.30]That wasn't a question, though.
[100:37.66]It doesn't have to be a question.
[100:41.23]Did I answer it like it was a question?
[100:42.51]No, I answered it like it was a comment.
[100:55.12]Your girlfriend says I'm cute.
[100:57.14]Will you look at that?
[100:57.68]Ding!
[100:57.98]You know what I'm saying?
[100:58.63]Alright, fold this in.
[101:07.99]Wait, is that...
[101:09.56]And then it turns around.
[101:10.62]I didn't fold this one all the way.
[101:19.04]Why am I having trouble with that?
[101:19.98]Like this.
[101:27.36]OK.
[101:27.76]We go in over here, fold up the two ends, and then it slides in.
[101:36.46]Two ends go in.
[101:38.94]Fold you down and close.
[101:44.07]We should get a pretty decent snap out of this one.
[101:49.43]Yep.
[101:53.16]Okay, little castle, little Burger King toy.
[101:55.18]Are we making a chest sit?
[101:57.74]Are we making a, fuck it, whatever, I'm gonna throw that one away.
[102:01.22]Now for the button itself.
[102:03.84]Flip this over.
[102:17.61]What's the house even supposed to do?
[102:18.67]I mean, we're going to find out.
[102:19.63]Stay tuned.
[102:21.83]We will all find out what this is supposed to be.
[102:25.49]I don't know what kind of minigame you can have in a house like this, but I'm sure we'll find out.
[102:29.66]Alright, fold it up.
[102:34.74]All the folds, right?
[102:35.68]And just stick it together.
[102:40.47]I could have known it was going to be like this.
[102:43.85]Fold it up.
[102:47.81]One, two.
[102:53.74]That looks good.
[102:54.86]All these little pieces.
[102:59.96]Who else is hyped for the new Spider-Man game?
[103:03.90]Me!
[103:11.36]Sometimes, I don't know, sometimes I forget that there's like 3,000 people watching me.
[103:18.65]I actually do forget that sometimes.
[103:23.97]Because how many people that just, when I did that, just went like this?
[103:28.97]Like, me.
[103:34.37]I don't know.
[103:34.85]Maybe some.
[103:43.88]That's all I picture.
[103:44.64]I picture like 400 people in this chat.
[103:49.01]So what is he doing?
[103:49.47]He's making fucking cardboard?
[103:50.79]Alright, flip this up.
[104:00.69]2,500 of bots?
[104:07.45]That would be fucking horrible.
[104:09.41]That ain't the case though.
[104:10.67]I don't do that shit.
[104:13.00]Alright, I'll fill the box up.
[104:16.52]Like that.
[104:19.17]This goes in here.
[104:20.29]Does it matter which way or is it all the same thing?
[104:23.93]It looks to be all the same.
[104:30.24]Don't embarrass yourself on stream.
[104:31.66]It's a little late for that, I think.
[104:39.69]Nice.
[104:40.35]That's in there good.
[104:41.97]Then this folds over like that.
[104:47.38]Jeremy, your audio is stuck in Spanish.
[104:51.79]That actually would probably be kind of funny.
[104:53.63]If I accidentally pressed a button and I just translated, I had like a Spanish dub for like 20 minutes.
[105:00.15]Hey, thanks for the stream idea because I'm going to do that.
[105:03.47]Randomly, at some point in the next couple months, I'm going to accidentally press a Spanish button and it's going to be whatever I'm saying dubbed in Spanish for about 25 minutes.
[105:15.39]The Toy Story already made that joke.
[105:17.91]Well, now Jerma985's gonna make it two.
[105:23.14]Simpsons did it, Toy Story did it.
[105:30.62]Well, there's been like nine Toy Stories, so I can understand.
[105:32.89]So this all just has to be folded in.
[105:37.51]Snap.
[105:43.54]You even notice that when you do that, right?
[105:46.11]I do this sometimes too, but when I'm on camera, I'm more conscious of it.
[105:48.41]I don't do it.
[105:49.41]But give, I want you to, next time you have like a friend over, give him something that he really has to pay attention and use his hands with and see if he does this.
[106:04.28]Guarantee he does.
[106:08.12]Why do we like open our mouths and shit?
[106:10.64]I don't understand why that happens.
[106:16.64]You could be sitting there.
[106:17.36]It could be this far away.
[106:18.48]And you'll be like, hmm.
[106:20.76]But then once it gets here, you... I don't understand.
[106:27.85]I do it too.
[106:29.81]Trust me.
[106:30.31]Pay attention.
[106:31.71]Alright, now this is the weird shape.
[106:33.07]This one here.
[106:39.82]Nope.
[106:40.38]No.
[106:40.66]Yes, you do.
[106:43.94]Worked with an electrician that used to do that.
[106:46.04]See?
[106:46.98]One guy said that.
[106:49.34]Flip it around.
[106:50.08]Fold it all up.
[106:51.80]And then the little ones too?
[106:52.78]No, don't fold the little ones.
[106:55.22]We actually are making... This was like a... This is a bishop.
[107:00.00]So don't fold the tops.
[107:05.47]Holy shit, man.
[107:12.53]What happened?
[107:16.57]My QR code isn't working.
[107:18.45]Hold on.
[107:18.77]For the Ethereum?
[107:20.85]Is somebody going to give me Ethereum?
[107:23.85]It's been like 114 days since somebody's given me like a dollar in Ethereum.
[107:28.28]I'm excited now.
[107:30.24]What?
[107:30.60]Hold on.
[107:30.90]You're going to get Ether?
[107:40.50]No, I deleted it.
[107:41.14]It's not there anymore.
[107:43.82]I deleted it.
[107:45.14]I'm getting trolled here.
[107:46.38]I deleted that like a week ago.
[107:47.74]Never mind.
[107:55.08]The whole thing folds up into a 1, a 2, and then a 3.
[108:07.03]And it latches onto itself here like this.
[108:13.52]We're going to get Ether?
[108:16.12]Yeah.
[108:17.30]And now this piece is sort of weird shape.
[108:21.26]Now what do you want me to do?
[108:23.92]This is going to be the top half of the main block.
[108:26.08]Check that it's the right shape.
[108:29.74]It's this one.
[108:33.60]You get so excited about crypto.
[108:37.68]I think crypto is interesting.
[108:44.52]It's an interesting thing.
[108:47.20]All folds up.
[108:48.38]I got a twitchy eye.
[108:49.20]Why?
[108:50.15]Probably need to hydrate.
[108:51.47]Nah.
[108:52.65]I'll do that, like, in a few days.
[109:05.55]What am I doing?
[109:06.29]LTC donations?
[109:09.94]I kind of... No, I think...
[109:13.41]I think eventually there'll be enough support for like crypto on Twitch that I could have an actual API built in.
[109:20.37]But that was a very, very massively failed experiment.
[109:25.04]I had like an address and I talked about it a few times and only three people did it.
[109:29.08]It was a collectively like $8 over like almost a year.
[109:34.08]So it don't matter.
[109:37.22]It's alright.
[109:39.59]He's trying to impress us.
[109:42.06]Really?
[109:42.56]By saying $8?
[109:43.16]And then this turns.
[109:47.29]Hold on.
[109:47.47]Which way does it turn?
[109:49.15]Like this?
[109:50.75]This thing comes.
[109:51.37]Then slot the part we just made straight through the middle.
[109:55.37]This is getting weird.
[109:56.17]Alright.
[109:58.57]So like this.
[109:59.31]This feels a little flimsy.
[110:04.98]Flimsy.
[110:05.62]That's not right.
[110:11.06]Go back.
[110:14.83]No, this is right because the part that's sticking up, the two little slots, and then the fat end.
[110:19.09]Yeah, this is correct, but from here, it doesn't seem like it matches up correctly like it does on their screen.
[110:31.35]No, it does.
[110:33.47]Now for the bottom half of the block.
[110:34.87]Are we making a flower?
[110:35.83]What are we making?
[110:41.31]Jesus, this is bad.
[110:45.85]Am I building a house?
[110:46.63]Yep, I'm building the house.
[110:49.33]Bottom half of the block.
[110:50.45]Spin it around.
[110:52.37]Fold everything again.
[110:53.56]Yes, yes, yes.
[110:54.86]All the tabs too.
[110:57.86]And then make a box.
[110:59.90]I think I can handle that.
[111:05.42]What does the house do?
[111:06.16]I don't know.
[111:07.18]We'll find out.
[111:13.17]Why are they all phallic houses?
[111:17.53]No, it's not.
[111:18.53]Everything, guys, everything is shaped phallically.
[111:24.45]You understand?
[111:27.93]You could turn everything into a phallic shape.
[111:31.25]Come on.
[111:39.11]What's that?
[111:41.20]Couldn't say that.
[111:44.66]What about this?
[111:47.69]What about that?
[111:49.71]Yeah, you already know what that is.
[111:52.11]Do I have to say anything about it?
[111:54.47]What about this?
[111:57.19]Hmm?
[112:01.85]Everything.
[112:02.91]You could fold something up and it could be phallically shaped.
[112:08.49]So saying, come on, I didn't do this.
[112:11.32]Everything just looks like that.
[112:13.46]Everything in the world.
[112:16.94]Your car is shaped like that.
[112:25.97]Look at the house.
[112:27.61]This house.
[112:28.38]Stop giving me shit.
[112:46.34]Alright, I'm going to match these up.
[112:48.50]So it's... Damn.
[112:50.66]It doesn't... I don't like how... I feel like this is not correct.
[112:52.58]I feel like it's not in there right.
[112:58.85]But it is.
[113:00.21]Whatever.
[113:03.45]Just going to let it be.
[113:05.61]So then match up the... Do you have the marks on the same side for both pieces?
[113:10.24]Yes.
[113:11.44]So then the whole thing goes... Another one of these.
[113:13.90]Another...
[113:15.99]case for the case and then what the fuck am I gonna do here hold on wait hold on I've got it wrong it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong so it goes like this
[113:55.66]What the fuck is happening?
[114:08.15]No, that's right.
[114:11.72]Yeah, so ah, ah, ah, ah, OK, OK, OK, hold on.
[114:24.10]Am I doing wrong?
[114:24.94]What have I done wrong?
[114:29.74]Go back.
[114:31.44]I was too busy talking about stuff.
[114:33.04]Go back.
[114:33.50]But this is not on there, right?
[114:41.18]Yes, it is.
[114:41.70]Hold on.
[114:45.54]No, this is on there, right?
[114:47.47]This was correct.
[114:51.76]I don't understand.
[114:53.03]How is that supposed to be different?
[114:56.85]See what I'm saying?
[115:08.80]This is on their right.
[115:14.40]But this one is supposed to go in and connect in.
[115:16.98]But it's too long.
[115:21.02]Nice work.
[115:21.58]I just want to flip it around one more time, just make sure I have it there.
[115:31.62]No, that's it.
[115:36.94]Look at the logos.
[115:39.28]No, I know the arrows are supposed to match up, but it's not bending back the correct way, because this is on the right.
[115:46.18]And this goes around here.
[115:51.18]Oh, I put it on the wrong way.
[115:52.08]Okay.
[115:55.38]I was trying to match it the other way.
[116:06.37]Shh.
[116:09.83]Finally, finally.
[116:10.73]Well, I was, I was, I switched it around like three times.
[116:13.29]I was just like talking.
[116:14.17]Okay, this is,
[116:21.24]Yeah, it goes all the way in.
[116:23.36]All of them has to go all the way in.
[116:25.10]Holy shit, dude, really?
[116:31.83]God damn, this one is fucking sloppy.
[116:34.95]There we go.
[116:43.17]Unnecessary steps.
[116:46.93]Look at all these fucking unnecessary steps.
[116:52.50]There.
[116:56.17]Can I get some brain fluid?
[116:57.29]No, what were we talking about when I was in the movie?
[117:01.43]We were having a dumb conversation.
[117:05.27]Spread these four long arms out to the sides.
[117:08.64]There's more to this stupid thing.
[117:10.02]Oh, this thing goes in there.
[117:11.42]What the fuck?
[117:16.32]There's even more to this.
[117:20.32]And then this goes in.
[117:23.01]Slide the button box snugly into the hole in the middle.
[117:34.34]Okay, next bend these side flaps and slot them into the button.
[117:42.96]All the way around.
[117:47.31]Shit, I didn't fold the little nubs.
[117:57.46]Oh no, this is to be folded.
[118:01.78]Stupid, like, mana potion.
[118:03.20]Hold on.
[118:05.77]Take this out for a second.
[118:07.37]These need to be folded.
[118:21.71]I work with my hands.
[118:23.93]I got all these calluses all over my hands.
[118:25.65]I used to lift...
[118:27.05]I did, yes I did.
[118:28.95]You can prove that with a video clip if you want, for all the new viewers here.
[118:32.24]Okay, and that goes in.
[118:40.20]Snuggly it says.
[118:42.70]That, and then these click in.
[118:45.78]One.
[118:49.41]Two.
[118:52.05]Three.
[118:54.47]Four.
[118:57.09]It's in there, right?
[119:00.01]Looks like the box.
[119:01.77]Is this a button I press?
[119:03.27]I think this is a button.
[119:05.20]It's a spring.
[119:05.82]Oh, I see.
[119:27.81]That's it, done.
[119:31.93]We got our spring.
[119:36.27]Time for more markers on this thing, great.
[119:40.95]Push it down, keep the button pressed down so you can stick these on the end.
[119:44.46]Watch carefully so you can stick them in just the right place.
[119:48.84]Oh, fuck you.
[119:50.36]Could be four of these, right?
[119:59.14]Okay, so push it down and it's going to go right in the middle.
[120:03.89]So all the way down and then here.
[120:06.47]Now I need two people for this one.
[120:14.80]My fingers are so sweaty and shit.
[120:16.52]Like I need like three people for this.
[120:30.52]OK.
[120:30.74]There's one all around all four sides.
[120:37.89]One, two, three, four, right in the middle.
[120:47.77]Hold on.
[120:51.32]Let me see it.
[120:58.36]Almost.
[121:05.55]Looks good.
[121:08.45]Flip the house.
[121:09.09]I'm not going to flip the house.
[121:10.89]Why do you guys want me to break it so much?
[121:18.46]A couple more.
[121:19.53]Oh, my ass.
[121:37.99]Last one.
[121:41.31]Can't wait to do this on the other, like three springs I have to bake.
[121:44.15]Fuck.
[122:03.21]Nobody's hands are this small.
[122:06.15]Nobody's hands are this small.
[122:20.87]I can't get it off.
[122:27.20]Don't rip it.
[122:28.24]Easy.
[122:29.16]Don't break it.
[122:35.00]Done.
[122:35.28]Okay.
[122:35.68]Good.
[122:39.32]Alright.
[122:39.60]Spring.
[122:42.32]Installed.
[122:43.90]Can't see it.
[122:44.90]Now you can.
[122:46.92]Looks pretty good to me.
[122:48.18]Alright.
[122:49.34]So that's done.
[122:52.50]I have big ears.
[123:00.38]I don't.
[123:03.68]No, that is red.
[123:06.94]Oh my god, there's more of these.
[123:09.35]Whoa, wait, hold on.
[123:12.37]Keep the button pressed down so you can stick these on the end.
[123:14.77]Watch carefully.
[123:16.85]So... We're taking on the bottom.
[123:22.57]Position the sticker correctly.
[123:24.03]Use the little notches as a guide.
[123:25.35]So right in the middle.
[123:28.87]This is very elaborate for how dumb this thing is going to be.
[123:35.62]So like this, right in the middle of the notches.
[123:52.78]It's fucking close enough.
[124:01.90]It's off center.
[124:03.10]It's fine.
[124:12.43]Wrap them around the corners.
[124:16.26]All the last pieces down here wrap around the corners and there's one left.
[124:30.90]It's one thing is this the the stickers are so little and the devices are so small and delicate Like it's not it's not easy to do this I need two little tools to like stick it on there It's for kids Even a kid's hands aren't small enough.
[124:55.74]You need to have little micro fingers even a child's hand
[125:14.40]at how many little... That is my least favorite part of the Labo.
[125:24.93]It's the little micro hand nuanced crafting with the tape.
[125:33.29]All this... Guys, you realize all this is going to do is I'm going to be able to press this button and it's going to go... That's it.
[125:42.28]That's all this is going to do.
[125:45.85]There's gonna be a guy in the house I can spring him up or something.
[125:58.05]Put a bunch of elaborate tape for a coin sound maker.
[126:03.85]I hope it shuts me up.
[126:04.97]I hope this is a really cool elaborate thing at the end here.
[126:10.28]One of the pieces is off by a lot.
[126:11.90]I gotta fix it, I can't.
[126:15.00]I need to make sure that the Sonic the Hedgehog coin sound happens in a good way, right?
[126:19.64]I don't know if I can save it.
[126:23.68]Like a little knife.
[126:25.22]Where's the little knife tool?
[126:27.42]So I can just say, if you make a mistake.
[126:32.22]They should have included at least one or two small knives.
[126:44.84]Oh, you little shit.
[126:45.89]Get over here.
[126:47.21]Alright, I got it.
[126:48.41]I can fix it now.
[126:51.47]Right up in the corner.
[126:52.65]All the way up.
[126:54.11]This.
[127:00.60]Alright.
[127:01.18]That's much better.
[127:02.78]Is this over or is there another piece that has to go on here?
[127:07.20]Make sure by pressing the button again you should be able to see the first four stickers popping in and out.
[127:19.76]Is this on there right?
[127:23.00]Yeah, it is.
[127:23.92]Okay, we're good.
[127:28.99]Forward.
[127:30.99]And now the moment of truth.
[127:35.31]Try slotting the button back.
[127:37.23]Block into one of the house's windows that should fit snugly inside.
[127:43.15]Which way does this need to go?
[127:44.60]So it starts off like that.
[127:47.46]And then they turn it.
[127:50.36]just like this okay so this goes into the side here it should just fit in there don't lie to me that's it oh what are you serious
[128:20.20]If that's a doorbell, I'm smashing it on camera.
[128:34.55]I'm not going to smash it.
[128:36.05]I'm just kidding.
[128:39.19]Button is done.
[128:39.71]Two more blocks to go.
[128:40.69]You want to take a break before tackling the next one.
[128:42.65]No.
[128:43.93]No breaks.
[128:45.93]No breaks allowed.
[128:48.17]Alright, sheets A and B, we have to do this shit again.
[128:54.25]I'll tell you, they really do, they really like you making stupid little knobs.
[129:02.07]This is complete, but I'm not done because I have to make like four knobs for you to screw in and go.
[129:06.95]No, I'm done, the house is done.
[129:11.83]I wanna live in this, let's go.
[129:30.35]I'm delusional.
[129:31.47]This guy's just delusional We're making another knob welcome to the knob stream This would be so much better where's Super Mario how come he's not on here Don't you think you should make an appearance
[130:02.05]Delusional.
[130:02.71]Why am I delusional?
[130:04.65]I'm having fun.
[130:09.13]So we're done with this, with A. A is completely toast.
[130:11.97]There's nothing else in here.
[130:15.22]Empty.
[130:18.78]I have this, so I have one, two, three, four, six pieces.
[130:21.92]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[130:25.30]Probably going to need something else.
[130:30.07]Yes.
[130:30.99]We'll move these two pieces from C and D. That is the base of, it's one of the blocks of the knob.
[130:39.23]So C, this comes out.
[130:43.78]Still one more piece in here.
[130:48.58]One, two, this needs to stick around.
[130:52.39]D is a piece of D. All the way bottom right.
[131:04.62]That's it.
[131:08.36]Let's go.
[131:10.76]Still on the house.
[131:12.78]Yes, I am.
[131:15.01]If you don't like that, then I'm sorry.
[131:18.71]I'll go faster.
[131:19.41]Let's put together the main shaft.
[131:20.71]That's the doohickey that spins around.
[131:22.55]My button is unbuttoned.
[131:26.58]I think.
[131:33.45]Okay.
[131:34.79]Now we're good.
[131:40.17]Alright.
[131:41.67]Let's... Let's... Let's get it done.
[131:47.39]He's late.
[131:47.99]Yeah, I'm late.
[131:49.45]We're very... Shut up.
[131:51.60]Not you guys.
[131:52.10]Me.
[131:56.60]First, let's put this... Let's do it in order.
[132:00.22]So, all the things fold up.
[132:05.50]I'm just going to fold everything.
[132:07.02]Shouldn't I just fold everything beforehand?
[132:10.14]Or is it more fun to see it piece by piece?
[132:13.46]You, the viewer, should ask yourself that question.
[132:16.26]What do you think?
[132:18.09]Fold everything?
[132:18.69]Or one by one with a couple of stories in the middle?
[132:21.19]You know?
[132:26.71]Looks good.
[132:29.49]Straw pole.
[132:30.33]No.
[132:33.30]That's done.
[132:33.92]Shaft is done.
[132:37.63]Oh, what's this piece?
[132:38.35]Yeah.
[132:40.22]A lot of them.
[132:40.96]There are seven fold lines to crease here.
[132:42.80]Try counting them as you fold them.
[132:44.16]Why would I do that?
[132:48.30]Why would I count them as I do it?
[132:52.82]And then it rolls up into a box.
[132:53.94]Okay, all these little pieces have to get punched out, though.
[132:57.76]Oh, well.
[133:03.94]Fine, I'll count them out loud.
[133:05.64]I will do you guys the favor.
[133:07.10]I will count them all.
[133:10.28]Because you're a child and you need to be able to count.
[133:14.22]I'm not sure kids can do this.
[133:15.38]What are the ages on this?
[133:18.16]I think this is like 21 and up.
[133:20.92]You've got to be legal drinking age to be able to put this together.
[133:34.85]Almost there.
[133:35.35]Hold on.
[133:40.26]Tell us.
[133:41.44]Why do you treat us like pond scum?
[133:43.12]What?
[133:43.74]You guys are fucking awesome.
[133:44.58]What are you talking about?
[133:47.72]When have I ever said anything mean like that to you guys?
[133:51.72]Why would I be that mean to you?
[133:56.82]One.
[133:56.98]Two.
[134:05.04]Three.
[134:10.23]Four.
[134:14.99]Five.
[134:18.91]Six.
[134:25.65]Seven.
[134:28.49]There, I counted for you.
[134:30.14]This whole thing folds up.
[134:33.67]this into a little roll up here.
[134:39.92]What do I do with this thing?
[134:43.52]That sticks in the bottom.
[134:45.22]Slot the cap from beneath.
[135:07.66]There we go.
[135:13.86]Just gets in there around all the edges, please, if you could.
[135:18.38]It's in there.
[135:21.71]Good.
[135:21.91]Nice snug fit.
[135:23.57]Okay.
[135:32.19]Now to make the handle, as a usual, start with the printed side down.
[135:37.86]You know, if only, if only I was drinking beer on stream right now, I would do the, you guys would think it was so funny.
[135:46.31]I would have had a beer already kind of pre-opened, and I would have been like, oh, okay, let me just like, and I would take it off of this, and you would be like, holy shit, he did that with cardboard?
[135:57.61]Too bad.
[136:02.85]Well, there's two lines here.
[136:08.15]let's cross go just go get a beer I don't have any beer in my fridge you guys saw inside my fridge there's like kefir and spinach and that's pretty much it and maybe one or there's like a small thing of pasta salad now slot it neatly into the main shaft pay attention to the shape of the piece to make sure you get it the right way around just like this and this goes
[136:39.15]So you just kind of put it in.
[136:41.41]It fits perfectly, right?
[136:44.51]Stick that in there.
[136:46.85]Really is like a perfect fit.
[136:48.24]That's pretty interesting.
[136:52.34]I say that, but you know, and then I try to do it.
[136:56.82]Of course, just make myself look silly over and over again.
[137:02.90]That does slide on eventually though, all the way down.
[137:08.16]over that first little knob.
[137:11.38]Get in there.
[137:20.59]Get this done.
[137:25.89]Pass this.
[137:26.61]It's got to go a little bit further down.
[137:32.33]Line it up with the edge here.
[137:35.08]Yeah.
[137:35.74]OK.
[137:37.41]There we go.
[137:38.31]It's nice and snug, and you can see the hole where something goes.
[137:42.83]I don't know what goes there, but we'll find out very shortly.
[137:45.87]I'm assuming we're going to fold it in half.
[137:48.68]No.
[137:50.78]One is a spare.
[137:51.54]There's two.
[137:58.94]I don't have that.
[137:59.76]Oh, it's these little ones.
[138:01.69]So this one's a spare.
[138:02.61]Just hold on to it.
[138:06.12]This piece may be small, but it's still important.
[138:07.90]And if you don't crease it well, it won't roll up properly.
[138:11.30]Oh my God.
[138:16.05]This is gonna be like the challenge of can you fold a piece of paper more than seven times?
[138:21.71]Or what is it, 11 times?
[138:25.59]It's like the bar trick.
[138:26.79]Am I gonna get bar tricked?
[138:33.39]The whole thing just turns it, okay, I get it.
[138:35.02]I just gotta do it all.
[138:42.26]This is... These are... I don't want to break it.
[138:52.08]Damn.
[138:53.56]He can't do it.
[138:54.25]What do you mean I can't do it?
[138:55.73]I'm doing it right now.
[139:01.75]Don't say he can't do it before I do it.
[139:08.26]Because I am doing it.
[139:23.52]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[139:35.19]Jesus Christ almighty.
[139:36.49]What would my mother say?
[139:38.63]No, what would your mother say?
[139:42.80]What would your mother say if she knew the shit you were saying right now?
[139:54.69]Am I streaming in my underwear?
[139:56.25]No, I have shorts on.
[139:57.49]I'm wearing shorts.
[140:03.61]What would your mother say about this?
[140:05.63]That's what I want to know.
[140:09.68]Oh, so what, you were watching a live streamer today?
[140:11.98]Yeah, I was.
[140:13.82]Oh, and what, did you type in the chat room?
[140:16.56]There's a chat room, I heard.
[140:18.14]Yep, there's a chat room.
[140:19.44]Oh, so what did you write?
[140:20.34]Like, hey, cool design, nice product.
[140:23.54]Nice bulge.
[140:26.08]Oh, you said that?
[140:27.24]You're grounded.
[140:28.60]No, I just, you weren't supposed to see that, Ma.
[140:39.57]What would your mother say?
[140:40.49]Hey, we got a very strict rule in this chat.
[140:46.63]Don't say shit in here that you wouldn't say in front of your grandmother.
[140:52.33]That's not true.
[140:53.23]I've said a lot of fucked up stuff on this stream.
[140:57.15]Forget it.
[140:58.63]The whole thing rolls up.
[141:01.21]So it rolls, and this rolls, and it really rolls very tightly into here, and then it slots in.
[141:11.17]So you end up with a little hammerhead shark, and that fits perfectly.
[141:19.07]What size is my mattress?
[141:20.35]Why do you want to know that?
[141:23.96]You don't want to know my mattress size?
[141:25.48]You want to know what size my mattress is?
[141:30.36]For what?
[141:31.74]What if I told you it was a twin?
[141:34.98]Would you think less of me?
[141:40.13]Roll up and insert the tab and fold these back.
[141:45.73]No, it's not a twin.
[141:46.71]It's a queen.
[141:47.53]I sleep in a deluxe queen.
[141:49.61]And yep, it is a deluxe.
[141:54.03]But every baby toy I've ever seen told me that this is not supposed to work.
[142:00.97]Square into the circle.
[142:06.18]You're going against every baby toy here.
[142:10.50]Whatever.
[142:17.65]That.
[142:19.46]Slide the piece through.
[142:20.36]That's in.
[142:21.42]It doesn't feel very snug, though.
[142:22.60]It feels pretty loose.
[142:32.27]And then now it's time for the little stopper piece.
[142:35.49]Put this down.
[142:36.13]I have to pee really badly.
[142:39.77]Fold it over and slide it all the way through the slot.
[142:41.67]Connect to the shaft and the handle.
[142:42.74]Okay, so it's the big one or the little one?
[142:44.26]There's two of these.
[142:44.82]One of them's bigger.
[142:46.16]It's the big one.
[142:53.26]Pee in the house.
[142:58.08]If I wasn't going to get banned for doing that, I might pee down the chimney here.
[143:04.92]Just like a stream right in the middle.
[143:10.38]Alright.
[143:10.60]So this slides in to here.
[143:12.78]So you click all the way through.
[143:16.01]So this goes in here.
[143:17.11]Look at this.
[143:27.54]Got to go through that hole.
[143:30.40]Which I'm having a little bit of trouble.
[143:32.14]Fuck.
[143:34.93]Hold on.
[143:38.39]There it is.
[143:40.41]And there it is.
[143:43.09]Alright, stopper's in that one.
[143:46.82]That... I need something to hold this in place.
[143:51.48]What's wrong with this freak show?
[143:52.76]I don't know.
[143:56.36]Should be able to see it peeking out.
[143:57.62]I can.
[143:58.02]And the whole thing folds down.
[143:59.71]Oh, yikes.
[144:02.31]Okay, the whole thing folds over.
[144:13.67]Okay, like that.
[144:16.66]Interesting.
[144:21.52]Any stop or go here?
[144:25.33]No, apparently that's it Now for the actual block part as usual, let's crease all the folds It is the whole thing Pop it all out This whiskey is the best whiskey you've ever bought what is it?
[144:46.80]If it's not Johnny Walker blue then
[144:55.33]Although there are better whiskeys than Johnny Walker Blue.
[144:58.02]There are a lot of better whiskeys than Johnny Walker Blue.
[145:00.10]It just happens to be my favorite.
[145:08.38]Scotch is not whiskey.
[145:09.40]I know.
[145:13.67]Drinking mayonnaise.
[145:17.25]What does that have to do with alcohol?
[145:22.69]These little tabs.
[145:25.07]I need to slow down though.
[145:26.19]I feel like I'm doing this too fast and I'm bending parts that I shouldn't be bending.
[145:32.37]Listerine.
[145:34.34]Don't fucking drink Listerine.
[145:36.32]What are you, out of your mind?
[145:37.20]Are you out of your goddamn mind?
[145:43.54]You swish it around and you wait two minutes.
[145:47.39]But you can't wait two minutes because after about 12 seconds it's the most burning awful sensation like your mouth is on fire and you have to spit it out.
[145:58.25]You know, like when you do a capture and it tells you, oh, hey, wow, you completed the capture very fast, faster than 95% of all users.
[146:07.90]I wonder what the capture rate is for people that actually do mouthwash for more than like a minute and a half.
[146:15.17]How many percentage of users do the capture where they leave it in there for two minutes?
[146:27.55]You don't know what I'm talking about.
[146:31.72]You don't know the capture where you slide the things and it tells you that you beat... That might be for one website I've ever used.
[146:37.30]That might... That actually might be only on one website.
[146:48.54]Yeah, it's on Binance.
[146:53.06]That's one fucking website.
[146:56.64]Well...
[146:59.05]Somebody will get it.
[146:59.83]Alright, here we go.
[147:07.35]Fold it, fold it.
[147:09.21]What about the little finger thing that's right here?
[147:10.61]I don't need to break that out.
[147:14.53]Delusional.
[147:17.25]Stop saying those things about me.
[147:20.14]This comes up.
[147:22.96]The whole thing folds down.
[147:25.50]Up into a box like that.
[147:29.76]And then all the pieces are going to fold up and in.
[147:31.82]But I don't punch.
[147:32.56]OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[147:33.74]OK, so the finger comes up eventually.
[147:36.36]Let's snap this in.
[147:46.86]That's in.
[147:47.48]And then this piece goes out.
[147:52.14]Snap it in.
[147:54.67]OK.
[147:55.75]A nice, cute little box.
[147:59.41]Pull the finger, I just did.
[148:04.73]Now insert the crank into the block as shown.
[148:07.14]Pay attention to the markings.
[148:08.42]It's easy to get it the wrong way.
[148:13.78]So finger up.
[148:17.12]Then this goes in.
[148:20.38]When you pay attention to the markings, it's easy to get the wrong way.
[148:23.08]So it gets to go like that.
[148:27.98]Okay, slide it all the way in.
[148:32.56]All the way down until it fits snugly and the HDMI is sticking out the back.
[148:40.24]Like that.
[148:43.34]Perfect.
[148:46.81]I'm doing, what, that's the right way.
[148:47.89]What do you mean I'm doing it the wrong way?
[148:48.95]That's the correct way.
[148:52.65]Another one of the stoppers, fold it in half and stick it on, I know where it goes.
[148:58.54]right through, okay, that's cool.
[149:00.98]Let's fold this in half.
[149:06.80]And then that goes, oops, like this, right into the slot down here, which stops, what is it stopping exactly?
[149:25.13]Just so it doesn't come up, okay.
[149:28.04]That goes in.
[149:29.58]Put the mushroom all the way in.
[149:31.54]Sticking out the other side.
[149:33.44]Now back to this weird tab on the side.
[149:35.38]Know what it is?
[149:36.92]A sound effect tab.
[149:38.48]Fold it in half and stick it through the slot.
[149:43.87]Sound effect tab.
[149:47.29]It's going to be one of those like click, click, click, yeah.
[149:51.47]It's in.
[149:54.05]It's a doorbell.
[149:54.79]Yeah, I swear to God if it's a doorbell.
[149:57.44]It's gonna be a doorbell crank.
[150:01.80]Try turning the crank.
[150:02.48]You should hear the tab making doorbell sounds.
[150:05.40]Okay, that's good.
[150:18.56]I think it works.
[150:19.74]Cool.
[150:21.54]We're pretty much, we got one or two more things to make with the house and then we're done.
[150:26.24]So where do I... Okay, this goes into... Nah.
[150:37.59]Fucking hell.
[150:42.09]Fold over one... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:44.21]Hold on.
[150:45.25]I need to get this in the right place.
[150:47.41]So I need to have it so there's a notch there.
[150:49.97]Fold one over the side where there's a little...
[150:56.94]Fold one over the side where there's a little.
[151:01.77]So this needs to be, there's the middle finger.
[151:04.43]There's a notch right here.
[151:05.93]So it has to be like this.
[151:07.19]Middle finger facing this way with a notch.
[151:11.48]And then this just goes on this side.
[151:13.04]Okay, great.
[151:14.90]That's wonderful.
[151:15.74]Okay, which pieces am I using?
[151:17.38]There's different thicknesses.
[151:18.42]Okay, that one.
[151:25.69]That goes all the way across.
[151:29.52]Where is it?
[151:33.04]Look at this.
[151:37.42]Here.
[151:40.16]Just across.
[151:40.98]Don't touch the notch.
[151:52.04]It's a little high.
[151:52.94]It's a little high, right?
[151:53.80]But that's alright, isn't it?
[151:58.20]That's a little high, right?
[152:02.62]No, it's alright.
[152:03.40]It should be okay, right?
[152:06.73]I think that's okay.
[152:07.97]I'm going to leave it.
[152:08.75]Fuck it.
[152:11.73]No, that's fine.
[152:13.51]Turn it again.
[152:14.15]So turn this a little bit here.
[152:15.61]You want to stick it on all alternating sides of the hexagon.
[152:20.31]So two more.
[152:20.95]So then right here.
[152:28.81]I'm so glad that this is the last sticker piece.
[152:31.07]No, there's actually one more over there.
[152:35.45]Get rid of these goddamn stickers.
[152:37.89]Same thing.
[152:52.05]This is way harder than it should be.
[152:57.11]That's good.
[153:01.88]Focus.
[153:05.31]It's focused.
[153:07.29]That's not bad.
[153:07.69]That one's better than the last one.
[153:10.45]And then one more here.
[153:17.20]One more strip and then, oh my God, damn it.
[153:22.36]This is more than the piano needed.
[153:25.41]The piano was an elaborate working instrument.
[153:31.02]What the hell is all this even for?
[153:32.40]No, not good enough.
[153:38.66]A little bit lower.
[153:43.46]How's the posture?
[153:44.02]How's my neck?
[153:45.80]It's good?
[153:46.20]Okay, that's it.
[153:48.95]Now they could flip it upside down.
[153:51.69]Now for some tiny little triangle stickers.
[153:53.41]They go on the bottom.
[153:59.97]Place them as shown to match the bigger stickers on the outside.
[154:03.96]So they just have to match these up.
[154:12.66]Shit, I can't even access these.
[154:19.36]These are tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny.
[154:26.71]These are actually tiny.
[154:46.45]I can't put this on there.
[154:47.71]That's not possible, guys.
[154:50.85]This is not possible.
[154:53.08]I need a tool.
[154:53.84]I need a separate tool for this.
[154:55.28]My finger's too big.
[155:17.16]We are going with a good enough scenario because I can't.
[155:26.79]It's already there.
[155:27.39]It's done.
[155:27.75]I don't care.
[155:30.98]Good enough.
[155:31.78]Good enough, Mario.
[155:34.02]Deal with it.
[155:47.47]oh it's so painful to do it I got it these are off but I don't care this is so this is awful like I told you already even a child this is too small even for a little kid this is a choking hazard this is what they were describing on the box not any of the cardboard
[156:17.30]Alright, that's good enough.
[156:19.16]It really is.
[156:19.58]I don't even care.
[156:23.02]Kids have more tactical hands, though, for these sort of crafts.
[156:25.80]I don't know if they do, though.
[156:29.12]Do they?
[156:33.70]Tactical hands?
[156:35.28]Yeah, the kids got these.
[156:36.50]There's more.
[156:37.40]Finally, we need to wrap the longest sticker all the way around the shaft.
[156:41.53]Easy does it now.
[156:42.31]It pays to be slow and careful.
[156:53.15]It's going to be a doorbell.
[156:54.01]It's going to be a rotating fucking doorbell.
[156:57.09]Just watch.
[157:00.03]This goes underneath.
[157:01.35]Hold on.
[157:01.65]Do you see that again?
[157:04.53]Yeah, underneath the tab.
[157:09.74]You don't have to do this.
[157:10.98]I'm enjoying this.
[157:11.72]It's a challenge for me.
[157:28.37]Mom told me to go slow.
[157:38.15]So I'm going to listen to my mother.
[157:45.64]There.
[157:49.98]Can this thing be done now?
[157:51.16]Or is there more pieces?
[157:52.60]Alright, try turning the shaft again.
[157:53.76]Can you see all the stickers going around and around?
[157:59.90]Yes.
[158:04.52]Nice, dude.
[158:05.28]Hey, thanks, man.
[158:06.70]I appreciate the help.
[158:07.58]Alright, only two more steps.
[158:12.69]No, and then another moment of truth.
[158:16.21]Slide the block into one of the house's windows.
[158:31.62]Stupid house, by the way.
[158:38.15]It fits.
[158:39.51]No, but in truth, it fits in and... Ooh, I don't know if it works.
[158:48.33]Yeah, it does.
[158:54.50]It works.
[158:56.80]Good!
[158:59.20]Done.
[159:04.53]The crank block is complete.
[159:05.97]Just one more block, you wanna head straight into it or stretch your legs.
[159:14.85]Still building.
[159:18.43]I'm not allowed to go to the bathroom until this is done.
[159:20.97]Making the key block.
[159:23.13]Three pieces from B and C, so when you B this little, this is the last part of B. B is, this whole thing's done.
[159:34.09]B is complete.
[159:34.93]No, it didn't rip.
[159:37.11]We're fine.
[159:37.97]No more B. And then C, the two last pieces in the top.
[159:47.65]So B is right here.
[159:54.97]Yeah, I'm fine.
[159:56.17]I got a P, but we're less than, I would say we're less than 30 to 40 minutes out of being complete with this whole house.
[160:05.12]C and D, B and C, B, C, or B, C, B. B and B and C are done.
[160:11.50]I should have spoken that B, C, B. And then this one piece from D. This lower left one.
[160:28.00]How can they be, there's still two more things to do.
[160:41.48]What a cool little feature, huh?
[160:45.98]Okay, those two pieces are the final step.
[160:51.02]This one should go fairly quickly, I hope.
[160:52.44]That's the last of the pieces we need for the house.
[160:54.08]Don't get rid of the extra pieces.
[160:55.64]They'll come in handy later.
[160:58.01]Let's store the sheet D. Alright, this is it.
[161:02.53]So we got two of these.
[161:04.75]This is the little canister.
[161:05.87]This is gonna flip over like that.
[161:07.51]How many pieces need to pop out of these ones here?
[161:13.00]The last step is putting the Joy-Cons inside.
[161:14.86]Yeah, that's probably right.
[161:16.32]I can see that being true.
[161:26.86]Alright.
[161:27.98]Fold it up.
[161:31.42]All the folds, and then turn it into the same thing, a little crank.
[161:35.26]Whoa.
[161:39.05]Hold on.
[161:49.19]Game sucks.
[161:49.71]Game doesn't suck.
[161:50.37]It's just boring.
[161:51.87]It's not boring.
[161:52.73]It's fun.
[161:54.15]Look.
[161:55.21]You got me all kinds of twisted right now with this bullshit.
[162:00.56]You're lucky if I ever turn a goddamn camera on again.
[162:03.00]For real.
[162:03.46]Fold that.
[162:11.84]That looks good.
[162:18.24]Another one.
[162:29.07]So how long is the RC car?
[162:31.11]We already did that.
[162:31.71]How long is the motorbike?
[162:35.42]How long is that one?
[162:38.48]Why is my... It's a pants situation.
[162:41.80]You ever seen literally episode one of Curb Your Enthusiasm?
[162:48.90]If you just go... I'll wait.
[162:51.48]It's like a 30 minute episode.
[162:52.84]Just go watch the first episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[162:56.76]We'll sit here for 30 minutes.
[162:58.34]When you're done, come back and we'll talk about it.
[163:04.68]No, no, alright, fine.
[163:05.90]We're not gonna, we won't watch it then.
[163:15.79]It's the pants material.
[163:17.23]That's right, Larry David.
[163:28.96]Okay, these are getting wet from my hands.
[163:32.93]I was asking why they're wet.
[163:34.41]They're wet because of me.
[163:36.29]Because I'm wet.
[163:38.35]I'm moisturized.
[163:42.41]I'm putting moisture from my hands into the cardboard.
[163:50.74]Now we need a rubber band.
[163:51.98]Small rubber band.
[163:52.68]One of these.
[163:53.38]I got them right here.
[163:54.08]I was prepared.
[163:58.48]Slide the rope band around these two little tabs here.
[164:01.01]Attach it nice and securely.
[164:02.87]That'll make things easier later.
[164:05.83]So it goes in and around like this.
[164:32.08]So then it goes, slide it around.
[164:36.60]Okay, make sure your rubber band looks like this.
[164:38.92]If it's not attached properly, the key mechanism won't work.
[164:46.46]Mine doesn't look like that yet.
[164:58.99]This is easier said than done for real.
[165:02.15]Fucking baby hands.
[165:13.48]Do you actually have to have infant hands to do this?
[165:18.59]An infant.
[165:20.05]Does this come with an infant to help me?
[165:39.70]I didn't break it.
[165:47.38]Why do I smell fire?
[165:49.30]Do I smell fire on this?
[165:56.17]Jesus Christ.
[165:57.03]Okay, is that good?
[165:57.99]It's going to come up a little more.
[166:15.30]It's not quite in this one.
[166:17.16]All the way over.
[166:17.74]I don't know how the fuck you're supposed to get your little infant hands in here to do that.
[166:33.38]What child is going to do that?
[166:37.38]Just for reference.
[166:39.42]Here's your reference.
[166:40.24]My index finger is bigger than the whole thing.
[166:47.07]That's good enough.
[166:49.38]What about the other side?
[166:50.30]I feel like this is too much slack here.
[167:03.03]It's going to have to do.
[167:04.73]Whatever.
[167:05.03]Okay, done.
[167:09.85]Use my nails?
[167:10.70]I don't have nails.
[167:16.10]I don't have nails.
[167:17.59]I've cut them.
[167:20.33]It's gonna have to do.
[167:22.81]That's what it looks like.
[167:24.65]That's close enough.
[167:28.37]Now roll the piece up and attach it together with the tab.
[167:37.80]This tab goes in like so, right?
[167:55.91]This folds up and in.
[168:04.17]Close this up as well and then spin it around and here you go.
[168:06.99]Now it's time to make the handle of the key.
[168:11.21]Use the included infant if you have problems.
[168:16.24]with needing a four millimeter length finger.
[168:25.62]All folds.
[168:32.51]Full thing.
[168:40.36]Angry baby.
[168:45.54]You know how this always says, ask an adult for help?
[168:48.94]No.
[168:50.12]I need a four-year-old to help.
[168:52.40]The adult has to ask the child for supervision.
[168:59.69]Not the other way around.
[169:00.41]Alright.
[169:07.03]A couple more.
[169:13.81]So that's how it's a family game.
[169:17.92]Yeah, I need somebody to put their finger like this so I can tie the present.
[169:25.20]Almost done folding this one.
[169:26.44]There's only one more piece, too.
[169:29.02]And then we insert the Joy-Cons, and finally, after two hours... Hasn't been that long, has it?
[169:34.54]Been like an hour and a half?
[169:35.61]How long has the house been?
[169:37.83]We started at what, like 40 minutes into the house?
[169:44.89]This is a pre-recorded stream.
[169:48.70]I don't know who told you that, but they were lying to you.
[169:51.98]They lied to your face.
[169:53.00]I don't know how much you spent on it, but I didn't charge any money for it.
[169:55.80]OK, up and around and then down.
[170:02.80]So up and around like that.
[170:05.04]This leaves the pieces like this.
[170:10.12]Tabs go in on either side.
[170:11.56]Yes.
[170:13.26]Come on.
[170:21.35]And this comes down like this.
[170:25.19]Two.
[170:26.85]Which leaves us with this little device here.
[170:30.63]Curve your pre-recording.
[170:32.45]Now these two big tabs should fold neatly inside.
[170:34.64]A little suitcase here.
[170:38.60]One.
[170:40.42]Two.
[170:42.66]Okay.
[170:44.48]A little suitcase.
[170:45.14]What about the tab here?
[170:48.48]Now just lift this middle tab up a bit and we're ready to fit the pieces together.
[170:51.56]Okay, so lift this up a little.
[170:57.99]And then this goes here like that.
[171:01.87]Before you slot them together, make sure you've got the shaft the right way up, which I do.
[171:06.59]Yeah.
[171:08.56]And that goes in.
[171:09.12]Like this.
[171:18.51]Push the tab all the way in.
[171:21.62]It's in.
[171:35.41]Sturdy.
[171:41.39]Now let's lay this piece down.
[171:43.41]I can't wait to use all the stickers.
[171:44.55]It's going to be great.
[171:52.30]We're in simulation, get out.
[171:55.34]We're in a simulation.
[172:00.15]This proves it.
[172:07.27]Why are the two Labo streams so lewd?
[172:09.65]Well, because everyone here is a funny guy.
[172:15.72]That's the reason.
[172:17.84]There's your reason.
[172:24.97]Alright, fold it all up.
[172:26.85]Gonna make a little square that slides in.
[172:28.58]I'm biting my lip.
[172:33.62]I'm not supposed to.
[172:37.92]Mom will be mad at me for doing that.
[172:46.30]I'm not supposed to be... Somebody tell me to stop.
[172:47.98]I'm not supposed to be doing that.
[172:55.36]I could get in a lot of trouble if my mother was watching.
[172:59.38]Stop biting your lip!
[173:01.30]What?
[173:01.54]I'm sorry.
[173:12.83]What am I, some kind of clown?
[173:19.26]When's the mom stream?
[173:21.30]You've already seen my mother on stream.
[173:26.24]She's not a camera kind of person.
[173:30.65]She likes to be behind the scenes, being a mom.
[173:39.36]This goes up and slides down like this, like that.
[173:54.98]And then now, hold on, we got something different here.
[173:57.44]Make sure that's in this snugly.
[173:59.82]Okay.
[174:01.80]Rubber band piece is coming out in the front.
[174:05.46]Spin it around.
[174:10.06]Then push the key right right under your legs.
[174:17.10]What?
[174:21.30]That could be actually like real though.
[174:23.05]I know you guys are just fucking around, but
[174:40.97]No, you guys are just, like, fucking around.
[174:46.65]This shit could be real.
[174:47.59]I'm down in the basement, man.
[174:48.69]Like, this shit could be real.
[174:50.19]I know you guys think it's funny, but I think it's funny, too.
[174:52.91]Laugh.
[174:54.47]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[174:55.47]Stop telling me there's, like, rats in my house.
[174:59.76]Stop.
[175:00.10]Okay.
[175:00.48]Push the key right through the hole with the printing on it.
[175:04.12]Pay attention to the direction.
[175:09.44]Wait.
[175:12.53]So that's in.
[175:22.94]That's in there.
[175:31.78]Jesus Christ.
[175:32.64]Hold on.
[175:33.00]Do I have to attach these?
[175:36.39]How does this work?
[175:40.27]Time to attach the rubber band.
[175:41.99]No need to rush.
[175:42.87]Take your time and make sure you get it right.
[175:45.53]So it goes out around that.
[175:50.65]Oh my god.
[175:51.43]Take your time.
[176:03.74]Don't rush.
[176:04.44]Take your time.
[176:11.88]Okay, it's on.
[176:12.36]The other one has to get on there.
[176:22.10]Wait, where does the other one go?
[176:25.79]Where does the other one go?
[176:30.39]Okay, now I got it on there.
[176:31.49]Now fold these up and then attach the tab.
[176:42.95]Like this.
[176:43.31]Okay.
[176:47.02]So that's on.
[176:49.14]Now the next one goes above.
[176:50.64]Okay.
[176:54.56]Then do the exact same thing on the other side with the rubber band and flip it around.
[176:57.76]Okay.
[177:04.21]That's on.
[177:06.35]On the bottom.
[177:08.93]Fold this shit in.
[177:19.21]Got it.
[177:23.23]Wow.
[177:31.48]Time to insert the third of our little stoppers.
[177:33.44]I don't know where though, where this would go.
[177:40.87]Big wow.
[177:42.55]Eat the raspberries, it's my only chance.
[177:46.45]It's the only chance I got.
[177:53.37]OK, got it the right way.
[177:57.01]Is this frame rate off?
[177:58.10]Because this one, my mic is popping now.
[178:12.69]Has my mic been popping the whole time?
[178:21.40]Yes.
[178:23.07]No.
[178:29.31]Why would my mic be popping?
[178:31.95]Your mic is not popping.
[178:33.80]No, I only say, Etalyx told me my mic was popping yesterday.
[178:39.86]So like, I don't know if he told you guys to say this.
[178:49.39]Alright, flip it around.
[178:50.47]This goes on the side here.
[178:56.62]in here.
[178:59.14]It goes all the way through.
[179:05.81]Has it gone all the way through?
[179:06.87]Yes, it has.
[179:09.67]In two seconds.
[179:14.03]Donezo.
[179:14.49]Alright, good.
[179:19.24]Now time to put a bunch of tape on it.
[179:21.10]Try turning the key.
[179:22.08]It should spring right back into position.
[179:44.09]Got it.
[179:47.53]Drink some water.
[179:55.85]What are these fucking stickers?
[180:02.44]I'm so glad I don't have to do this again for at least a little while.
[180:05.92]So this has to go on flat on here
[180:15.71]All the way at the end?
[180:16.58]Yeah.
[180:23.34]That, and then the other one goes down this side.
[180:32.07]I'm gonna shrivel up.
[180:34.83]No, I'm gonna be fine.
[180:36.31]I've retained water very well.
[180:42.65]I'm like a camel, I just have to drink one time.
[180:45.68]And then three years later, I can drink something up.
[180:47.86]Alright, so that's on.
[180:51.66]Place one horizontally along the tip there.
[180:53.82]Let's do the same thing again on this side.
[180:57.58]So hold on, I gotta see that again.
[180:59.44]So yeah, turn it.
[181:02.68]Same exact thing, okay.
[181:10.33]One on the flat side, one on the long side.
[181:19.70]There's no more of these little rectangle stickers, so this has to be the last of it.
[181:31.45]Okay.
[181:32.39]Done.
[181:34.15]That's it.
[181:37.67]Can't be anymore, right?
[181:43.19]Oh, why would you do these?
[181:47.12]So now flip it this way and then turn it over here.
[181:55.42]Oh my god, the little ones.
[182:02.16]That's even smaller than the last space.
[182:09.10]Look at this.
[182:13.18]Where's the baby?
[182:13.84]I need him.
[182:14.56]I need that baby right now.
[182:34.54]Take a look at that.
[182:37.50]Can you tell me that I did that wrong and wrong?
[182:41.00]Look at that.
[182:43.00]That could have been more perfect.
[182:57.49]Last one.
[183:01.87]It's taken me three hours to build this.
[183:04.40]Well, each of these actually are supposed to be like a two to four hour experience.
[183:10.40]So this is by design, by its own intention, it's supposed to be like this.
[183:22.01]Okay, I mean, I don't wanna toot my own horn here, but like seriously, wow.
[183:33.50]What a waste of money.
[183:35.62]Don't say that.
[183:41.37]We haven't even built the robot yet.
[183:44.79]Okay, that's all the stickers we're going to need.
[183:46.25]Put them somewhere safe.
[183:49.41]That's it.
[183:50.23]Fit it into the house.
[183:53.15]There's three windows, right?
[183:55.10]No, there's only two windows.
[183:58.36]Let's try putting it in here.
[183:59.28]Just make sure it fits.
[184:02.30]Which way does it go in?
[184:03.16]It goes in like this.
[184:11.35]Make sure it fits.
[184:13.19]Test the key.
[184:16.47]Then we can finally play the house game.
[184:18.07]It fits.
[184:27.27]Don't break it.
[184:28.23]It fits.
[184:34.21]Nice.
[184:35.91]Alright, we good.
[184:41.69]It works.
[184:45.06]Last step is the Joy-Cons.
[184:48.76]Here comes the last step.
[184:49.56]Are you ready?
[184:50.02]Start by removing the block from the house.
[184:54.84]Where are my three blocks?
[184:56.70]Oh, they're all in.
[184:57.18]Okay, take this.
[184:57.84]Take them out.
[185:03.74]All the blocks are out.
[185:06.26]Final step.
[185:06.78]Would you like to take a break?
[185:08.96]Attaching the Joy-Con.
[185:10.24]Alright.
[185:11.40]Get your console and Joy-Con ready.
[185:14.46]It's over there.
[185:17.03]First, insert the Nintendo Switch console into the slot.
[185:27.11]Oh yeah?
[185:29.44]Alright.
[185:31.00]Let's get it in here.
[185:36.77]That's not going to fit, Mom.
[185:47.75]And here.
[185:48.21]This thing is hot.
[185:51.54]Knock, knock.
[185:52.08]Coming in.
[185:52.54]That's what it says.
[185:53.02]Alright.
[185:54.22]So we're in.
[185:58.24]Can I safely turn this up?
[185:59.36]I feel like this is going to fall flat.
[186:04.41]I'm scared to do this.
[186:05.27]Now we want the Joy-Con.
[186:12.53]Okay.
[186:13.65]Now we want the Joy-Con that's the one with the plus button ready.
[186:16.21]So then it goes like this.
[186:24.71]Down through the chimney.
[186:29.05]Look for the marker and slide it down.
[186:39.33]That's in there.
[186:42.50]Okay.
[186:47.28]Done.
[186:50.00]Are you ready to play with the house?
[186:52.52]Oh boy, I can't wait to play with the house.
[187:05.13]I'm ready.
[187:05.39]Okay, get ready for three separate doorbells.
[187:18.86]Checking the Toy-Con.
[187:23.06]It's a little guy!
[187:35.73]Hello!
[187:50.03]This isn't even a key.
[187:51.83]What is this?
[187:53.19]Let's drown this motherfucker.
[188:07.56]Hey look, it's my house.
[188:21.17]Hello?
[188:22.13]Anybody in there?
[188:22.81]How do I drain the water?
[188:33.93]That's it.
[188:34.31]Okay, what about the other side?
[188:35.11]There's definitely other things I can do on the other side, right?
[188:39.62]Well, I gotta put this down.
[188:40.56]Can you guys see this if I put it down?
[188:44.22]What about the other side?
[188:45.18]This thing's gonna fall the fuck out and I'm gonna be mad.
[188:54.81]No, it's just a faucet again.
[189:03.74]What if we let go up here?
[189:04.80]Oh, this is different.
[189:06.46]Hold on.
[189:07.24]Okay, what do I do with this?
[189:20.79]Okay, that just changes the scenery.
[189:22.13]Now, what do the other ones do?
[189:25.61]Spring Ready for the doorbell.
[189:34.07]Oh, no, it's a light switch This one sucks
[189:59.55]Here have a gumball touch the food to have him eat it Now what

[191:07.64]Didn't say I was done, by the way.
[191:16.26]Leg shape.
[191:17.80]Forget it.
[191:18.18]Can I do something with the key in here, too?
[191:24.06]Can I do three things at the same time?
[191:30.46]Make it examine it.
[191:36.24]That's dumb, okay.
[191:37.74]Get this out of here.
[191:40.08]What about if I do the crank on the bottom?
[191:48.59]Make a fan?
[191:52.17]Where's the doorbell?
[192:03.11]Oh, this is different.
[192:03.67]Okay, hold on.
[192:04.07]Oh, I can spray him with perfume?
[192:06.31]Get him right in the eyes.
[192:12.54]That's what I want to do.
[192:33.78]This... Combinations of games.
[192:35.76]Alright, so hold on.
[192:45.42]Gotta hit the cheese.
[192:46.32]Depending on how hard you do it.
[193:02.29]Got him.
[193:07.63]Now what about if we do spring on the left?
[193:16.09]Spring on the left, crank on the right.
[193:21.14]Oh, eat this.
[193:31.22]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what happened?
[193:32.37]Oh, he ran, okay, I gotta, I gotta, I need to get, how do you do, you need two friends over.

[194:37.42]Last one, come on.
[194:41.02]Got it.
[194:44.15]This sucks.
[194:54.25]What have we not tried?
[194:57.56]Spring on the right?
[194:58.82]No, key on the bottom?
[194:59.88]Spring on the... Okay, what about turn on the bottom?
[195:04.48]Spring on the left.
[195:09.44]Oh, here's a new one.
[195:10.92]So this one is Little Vortex.
[195:13.94]Put them all in at the same time.
[195:22.45]I don't think, I think it just goes to the menu.
[195:24.23]Yeah, that's how you get to the menu.
[195:27.43]Crank the crank and the lamp lights up and push the steady, okay.
[195:32.79]I guess I can just see what the other games are.
[195:38.21]Jump rope.
[195:39.53]Every beach day needs ring toss.
[195:41.85]So I don't know how to... I didn't do ring toss yet.
[195:45.09]Steady aim fire.
[195:46.49]Grab a balloon.
[195:48.23]Wild ride down the railroad.
[195:50.41]Bowling.
[195:52.39]Can you tell me how to do these fucking things?
[196:01.34]There's nine games here.
[196:05.12]Try bowling.
[196:05.72]I don't even know what the combination for bowling is.
[196:08.76]Bowling's probably like this.
[196:14.50]I would assume bowling would be you bowl with this.
[196:20.84]There it is.
[196:21.54]This is bowling?
[196:22.22]Yep.
[196:23.84]So here we go.
[196:33.31]Dude, you can't do this with more than three hands.
[196:37.09]I got a shroom.
[196:46.81]Let's try to get a strike.
[196:58.68]Come on, I need a strike before I, I gotta get a strike, come on man.
[197:04.41]You do have three hands.
[197:07.11]What are you talking about?
[197:07.81]What?
[197:18.93]Doorbell.
[197:24.25]This fucking gyroscope is pissing me off.
[197:29.13]I got the sushi with eyes.
[197:30.45]Okay, come on.
[197:32.33]I gotta get a strike.
[197:39.56]Oh, give me a break, game.
[197:40.56]Come on, seriously.
[197:46.26]Fucking clown game.
[198:00.90]I'm getting angry.
[198:01.46]No, I'm not getting angry.
[198:02.22]I'm getting frustrated.
[198:05.86]Finally, there it is.
[198:06.52]There's your strike.
[198:09.13]I get my candy.
[198:15.85]That's it.
[198:16.35]Okay, now we pull this one out.
[198:18.81]Did we already try this on either side?
[198:23.14]Wait, he can eat these, can't he?
[198:24.38]Alright, he turns into SpongeBob.
[198:39.67]Oh, he changed colors.
[198:40.63]Okay, so what about over here?
[198:45.92]No, it can't only do that.
[198:48.66]What have I not tried?
[198:55.54]Light crank underneath?
[198:59.78]No, we've already done that.
[199:01.11]Crank on the left.
[199:06.99]No, I already did that one.
[199:09.33]Shake the house.
[199:10.01]I'm trying to think about what combination have I not done.
[199:29.13]Piss in the chimney.
[199:34.81]Water and then crank.
[199:40.65]Okay, here we go.
[199:41.79]This is different.
[199:44.41]Am I able to microwave this animal?
[199:47.49]What?
[199:48.49]I'm not gonna like put him in the microwave, right?
[199:53.88]What the fuck?
[199:55.16]Hold on, what about this?
[199:56.86]No.
[200:05.06]Why is there a fork next to the microwave?
[200:18.87]Put the fork in the microwave.
[200:21.25]I don't think I can.
[200:51.60]That's not doing anything.
[200:55.76]Lay it on the table.
[200:56.48]Yeah, but then you guys can't see it.
[201:08.44]Crank the other way.
[201:09.32]Whoa!
[201:09.50]Would you look at that?
[201:13.09]Alright.
[201:14.65]Very cool.
[201:15.97]Nice.
[201:16.43]Well, now what?
[201:22.53]I don't have any... I need food in here.
[201:29.82]Can I put the jelly bean in here?
[201:37.04]No, no, no!
[201:46.83]This is not right.
[201:47.49]This is not what my combination is.
[201:53.57]Okay, excuse me, what what are you doing?
[202:09.38]Okay, what are you doing?
[202:10.84]Okay, there we go So is there food there's a food tab, but there's no food tab
[202:24.12]Just put this into the microwave.
[202:37.38]What's on the top?
[202:38.12]There's nothing on top.
[202:40.84]And putting this in changes the game.
[202:46.42]I don't think I have enough food to do this.
[202:53.39]Nice bowling.
[202:56.41]Okay, here we go.
[202:56.85]Here's the minecart.
[203:01.61]Here we go.
[203:03.69]I just jumped over it.
[203:04.47]Okay, that's the bomb.
[203:05.71]I got a bar of soap!
[203:18.09]Do this one again.
[203:30.56]I doubt blended in with the background.
[203:31.66]That was bullshit.
[203:37.56]That was part of the background.
[203:40.35]Okay, now I... Alright, how much more of this can I take?
[203:47.15]Let's see.
[203:47.53]What have we got?
[203:49.45]Minigames.
[203:50.55]No, I wanna get to the minigames.
[203:52.87]Not fruits.
[203:54.15]I don't wanna see fruits and vegetables and shit.
[203:55.79]I wanna go to where the minigames are.
[203:57.15]Which one have I not done?
[204:03.70]I put the box in the microwave.
[204:16.47]I was thinking about it.
[204:17.17]I was thinking about just putting food in here.
[204:23.01]Okay, what's this?
[204:33.38]What the fuck is happening right now?
[204:35.68]Is it the gyroscope?
[205:03.73]There we go, okay.
[205:06.15]So, let's see what we haven't done.
[205:09.39]No, I don't want your desk!
[205:16.80]No, this is the candy again!
[205:29.20]That's candy!
[205:35.26]Okay, this was fun.
[205:37.08]I had a great time playing with the candy and all this other shit.
[205:42.89]There it is.
[205:43.41]Okay.
[205:46.71]Didn't do the beach ring toss.
[205:50.16]Did the balloon.
[205:50.80]Did the mine cart.
[205:52.90]Did the bowling.
[205:54.06]Did the candy level.
[205:55.94]Why not cook something in this miraculous oven?
[205:58.46]There's one we didn't do.
[206:02.41]so what how somebody look it up how do we do this flat this level three look at the frame of the pictures can I like unscrew that
[206:36.16]I don't think I can do anything about that.
[206:39.20]The frame has the items on the outside, does it?
[206:44.43]Oh, you say, okay, I see what you mean.
[206:46.41]So that's crank key.
[206:48.09]Yeah, so I have, it's already, why is it not doing it?
[206:51.77]I just already did this.
[206:56.52]Why is it telling me I didn't complete this?
[206:57.84]Oh, it's because I didn't even do it, okay.
[207:12.25]Alright, look, it don't even matter.
[207:13.39]We have to build the RC car now.
[207:15.29]No, I keep saying that.
[207:16.16]We have to build the... It's alright.
[207:36.72]Time for the motorcycle.
[207:40.65]I gotta pee.
[207:41.11]We'll be right back.
[207:43.97]That was kind of interesting.
[207:46.26]Sort of.
[207:47.94]Right back.
[211:06.18]One, two.
[211:07.26]One, two.
[211:08.38]One, two.
[211:09.08]Move those legs.
[211:10.42]Three, four, five, six.
[211:12.50]Feel it.
[211:12.86]Come on.
[211:13.70]Alright.
[211:19.34]Let me move this out of the way.
[211:20.18]Let's put this back in.
[211:28.05]I can't get the Wii.
[211:29.55]Not the Wii.
[211:30.05]I'm going to call this the Wii every day, by the way.
[211:32.95]I know it's called the Switch, but I'm sorry.
[211:34.65]I can't get over it.
[211:36.76]This is a Wii.
[211:40.88]I'm gonna put it back in.
[211:41.68]Let's get the Joy-Con out of there.
[211:48.46]Hold on.
[211:51.55]Here we are.
[211:51.99]Alright, let's get this back on.
[211:56.03]Show on the road.
[211:56.75]Hey.
[212:02.64]Alright, so the only thing we got left is
[212:12.21]Come on out of there.
[212:19.77]Discover!
[212:20.55]Discover the house.
[212:21.89]Well, we're not doing that right now.
[212:25.41]So if I go back... Make.
[212:31.07]So the last thing we need to make the motorbike.
[212:37.27]So the motorbike...
[212:40.20]is the same as the fishing rod.
[212:42.34]90 to 150 minutes.
[212:46.40]So the house and the piano are the two longest.
[212:49.91]So this one should not be that long, like an hour, hour and a half.
[212:54.89]Oh, you can't see?
[212:55.87]Fuck.
[213:00.11]So see the house was estimated like three hours.
[213:10.62]This is actually crazily estimated about four hours.
[213:12.76]So this was estimated about two to three hours, which is what it was.
[213:18.14]Bike will be done with the bike probably in the next hour or two.
[213:21.08]So we're good.
[213:24.21]Smash the house first.
[213:25.23]I'm not, no, no, no.
[213:26.27]I'm not gonna smash the house.
[213:30.05]You wanna do like a three little, I'll do a three little pig scenario with you guys if you want.
[213:37.08]See if I can blow it over with my breath.
[213:38.52]I got pretty good lung capacity.
[213:55.87]See?
[214:00.91]How impressive was that?
[214:04.42]It's fucking hollow and made out of cardboard.
[214:07.50]That's not impressive.
[214:10.42]Why did I think that was gonna be cool?
[214:12.30]Maybe if there was like a cinder block in here, that would've been pretty fun.
[214:14.70]Alright, there's the house, house is done.
[214:21.70]I'm gonna actually get it out of the way completely.
[214:24.00]So we can do the last one of this kit.
[214:27.28]And then we'll take a break from Labo for like, I don't know, until next week.
[214:31.57]And by next week, I mean like Friday of this next week, we'll get back to the other kit.
[214:41.53]Don't matter, stick you over there.
[214:42.85]Okay.
[214:46.57]You too.
[214:46.85]Okay.
[214:53.34]Low the music.
[214:56.86]You got it.
[214:57.18]Okay.
[215:04.52]So now, motorbike.
[215:08.81]I'm prepared.
[215:09.37]Are you prepared?
[215:11.35]Are you ready?
[215:14.59]This won't take us very long.
[215:17.63]Let's make the motorcycle.
[215:21.31]That looks kind of cool.
[215:27.28]Alright, let's go.
[215:29.13]Get our Joy-Cons over there.
[215:33.41]Making the Toy-Con motorbike.
[215:35.67]I feel like this one's going to be fun.
[215:38.95]Five steps.
[215:40.13]An hour and a half or so.
[215:42.65]Make sure you have the parts up there.
[215:44.37]Probably going to be a lot of rubber bands in this one.
[215:47.47]Alright, left handlebar.
[215:51.59]Seven pieces from A and B. What, um...
[215:58.43]What is this?
[216:01.50]I never made this, what is this?
[216:06.20]I don't know what that is.
[216:08.54]Okay, so we need seven pieces.
[216:13.08]That's a cardboard, I know what it is, but did I make it?
[216:19.19]That's extra parts for the house, okay.
[216:21.73]So A and B. That's a lot of sheets for this one, but it says it's not gonna take that much time.
[216:27.95]You know why I think this one's not going to take that much time?
[216:31.15]Because there's not a bunch of stupid paint the sticker strips on the thing.
[216:36.95]That takes the most time out of everything.
[216:38.55]Alright, seven pieces, A and B. Let's go.
[216:41.04]This whole thing here.
[216:51.10]Music is muted.
[216:52.68]We're going to do no music for right now.
[217:03.55]Did I take the wrong thing out?
[217:11.33]Fuck, I did.
[217:17.52]Ruined.
[217:18.22]That sucks.
[217:19.42]My OCD is gonna... That's gonna drive me crazy.
[217:23.58]Shit!
[217:26.99]No!
[217:29.03]Just put it over there and put...
[217:34.03]That's actually... I gotta go.
[217:35.59]I gotta go.
[217:35.97]I gotta get out of here.
[217:36.77]I gotta go.
[217:37.13]No, that's fine.
[217:40.60]It's all of them, actually.
[217:41.38]It's every piece from this whole thing.
[217:43.34]The whole sheet's coming out.
[217:44.28]Good.
[217:51.43]All of it.
[217:53.31]All of it.
[217:59.71]Okay.
[218:01.91]These are nice big pieces too.
[218:03.21]This should be really relaxing.
[218:05.15]I don't think it'll be that difficult.
[218:15.24]Empty?
[218:17.54]Good.
[218:21.09]And then I fucked up, but what do I actually need?
[218:22.95]Just one piece, this one.
[218:34.56]So that should be seven pieces from A and B. Got one, two, three, four, five.
[218:44.50]So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[218:48.37]Okay.
[218:50.19]Anymore?
[218:51.13]Or is that it for now?
[218:57.45]Do I prefer a warm toilet seat?
[218:59.01]Yes.
[218:59.65]Because when you sit down, it's a shock.
[219:01.27]It's annoying.
[219:02.71]Alright, let's make the horn.
[219:03.49]Beep, beep.
[219:05.85]So it's this.
[219:08.34]Flip it around like so.
[219:12.42]Like that.
[219:14.18]Wait, what?
[219:14.94]Well, one, two, yeah.
[219:15.74]Alright.
[219:19.58]Fold it all up.
[219:20.30]The key to a good toy con is to crease the fold lines.
[219:24.61]I know.
[219:26.23]I've made them all.
[219:27.79]I've made all of these.
[219:30.97]Watch out that.
[219:38.41]Chat is super slow all of a sudden.
[219:40.01]Well, it is getting later.
[219:42.41]And I did just go to the bathroom.
[219:44.27]And maybe 200 or 300 people have left the stream, so it seems.
[219:51.27]It's getting late, like 11 PM Eastern.
[219:59.74]Because we want the music.
[220:01.06]Well, you're just going to have to wait.
[220:10.74]Is that folded?
[220:11.48]This is my chance.
[220:20.12]That was your chance.
[220:24.13]My only chance.
[220:29.05]You want that dumb ass music back?
[220:32.45]There.
[220:34.83]There you go.
[220:35.59]Now it's slightly there.
[220:40.44]Let's fold this one.
[220:41.46]It should actually go all the way.
[220:44.96]OK, all the fold lines are done.
[220:53.72]Pretty snazzy.
[220:55.74]This one too, right?
[220:56.50]Yeah, I got that one.
[220:58.40]Alright, then fold this one over.
[221:04.90]Done.
[221:08.19]Now let's start by putting this thing together.
[221:09.75]Roll up along the fold lines.
[221:10.93]So roll it again.
[221:14.55]Like this.
[221:20.42]And then do it again.
[221:22.86]So then 3 is here.
[221:24.94]Like this.
[221:32.68]Quick check.
[221:33.10]Do you see the 3?
[221:33.46]Yes.
[221:39.33]Take shape, fold it up and around like this.
[221:45.43]Right, hold on.
[221:46.38]Yeah, this creases up and then the whole thing goes around like this.
[221:55.08]And then this snaps into place.
[221:59.48]I like that one.
[222:00.10]There was a lot of interesting folds there.
[222:07.20]Stick it in.
[222:10.41]So this is the horn.
[222:12.09]How do you beep this?
[222:12.85]I don't know.
[222:19.27]Interesting folds.
[222:21.61]Now for the left handlebar, check that you've got the piece of the L mark.
[222:27.80]I do.
[222:29.78]Flipping around and yeah, fold all this bullshit.
[222:32.60]Sure, let's do it.
[222:42.07]I go B?
[222:44.99]What?
[222:47.01]I'm scared of you guys?
[222:47.85]Why am I scared of you guys?
[222:48.59]What are you talking about?
[222:52.50]I have to play anime music right now.
[222:56.80]What anime music would you like me to play?
[222:59.98]Viewer's choice.
[223:07.16]Sing.
[223:08.72]I'm not going to sing.
[223:10.60]I'm just supposed to be relaxing right now.
[223:16.46]That's all the pieces that need to be popped up.
[223:20.60]Fold it all up.
[223:22.14]A nice even crease.
[223:29.11]Oof.
[223:30.99]Oof.
[223:32.33]That one was not easy.
[223:37.72]Relax harder what Ungrateful streamer will not sing for his fans.
[223:53.36]I'm not gonna sing.
[223:54.58]I don't sing on stream.
[223:56.22]I
[224:04.81]This is not one of those streams where I'm just going to burst out into song.
[224:07.25]Sometimes I'll do it randomly for like four seconds.
[224:13.41]More people are going to leave.
[224:14.52]Alright.
[224:19.90]I need to sing a song.
[224:20.72]What song can I sing for you guys right now that I know off the top of my head?
[224:28.02]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[224:33.59]Duck piano.
[225:03.70]Finish it.
[225:07.20]No, I can't.
[225:09.10]It's over.
[225:10.90]That's it.
[225:11.22]That's all you get.
[225:12.44]You get the first part of My Country Tis of Me.
[225:16.68]My Country Tis of Me.
[225:18.10]30 people left during that song.
[225:24.39]See?
[225:24.65]And you guys said I was going to gain viewers from that?
[225:28.61]You were not right.
[225:40.03]A lot of little ones here.
[225:42.03]Everything looks good there.
[225:48.03]Tab.
[225:50.87]Tab.
[225:51.55]Another tab.
[225:53.97]More tabs.
[226:01.53]Now the whole thing is going to roll together.
[226:07.96]Oh, wait a minute.
[226:08.46]OK.
[226:08.86]So now fold firmly along here.
[226:14.80]L this way, all the way to the bottom, and then here.
[226:19.96]I got this the wrong way.
[226:22.55]OK.
[226:23.71]On this line, wait, hold on.
[226:29.75]L. And then fold up like this.
[226:39.05]Use this little tab to lock the horn into place.
[226:43.05]So this is the, okay, that's kind of interesting.
[226:45.02]This is the horn.
[226:47.02]Stick this up and in.
[226:50.38]That's locked into place now.
[226:56.86]Does it fold now?
[226:57.62]Folds over?
[226:58.30]Roll the whole piece over.
[227:01.04]So the whole thing rolls like this.
[227:11.41]and up through that hole.
[227:15.85]Use this tab to hold it together when this comes down and across like this.
[227:27.24]Would you look at that!
[227:32.02]Close it down.
[227:36.50]Flip it this way.
[227:37.88]We have the L and the little horn slot.
[227:43.30]Close up this and pay attention to the order.
[227:44.90]It's middle pieces, top and the bottom.
[227:50.07]Middle, top, bottom.
[227:53.97]Click.
[227:57.17]Same thing in the end.
[227:58.57]Middle pieces, top, bottom.
[228:06.55]Okay, hold on.
[228:07.09]So this, let's go in.
[228:11.23]This folds up and then down.
[228:14.78]This comes out and across.
[228:18.03]Hold it in, stick it in the slot, and then close it.
[228:25.81]Do a dab.
[228:29.51]What are you guys?
[228:29.95]Out of your minds.
[228:30.63]I've been trying to live that down for the last seven and a half months.
[228:36.51]You want me to do it again and restart, rekindle that flame?
[228:39.30]That's not going to happen.
[228:41.72]It won't make a sound yet, but try pressing the horn button.
[228:44.14]Don't push it straight down.
[228:45.64]Slide it a little to the left.
[228:54.53]I guess it works.
[228:57.03]I guess.
[229:02.45]Yeah, it works.
[229:07.85]Step one done.
[229:09.97]There it is.
[229:12.19]There's your Reese's candy bar wrapper with a secret window to see just how fresh the chocolate is.
[229:18.15]It's hot down here.
[229:21.95]Give me a break.
[229:23.13]Alright, let's insert these two stoppers.
[229:33.32]Breezing right through this.
[229:34.36]Look at it.
[229:34.78]Come on.
[229:37.38]This one's good.
[229:37.86]I like this one.
[229:42.69]Alright, let's insert three of these stoppers.
[229:44.07]There are four altogether, but they're exactly the same.
[229:48.31]Flip them back, fold them in half.
[229:52.18]You got it.
[229:52.52]And then these are going to go in here.
[229:59.66]I'm going to assume that's where they go.
[230:04.87]Yes.
[230:07.37]So one goes in there, the other side?
[230:09.31]Yep.
[230:10.73]Directly across, so like this.
[230:14.52]Bingo.
[230:15.44]There's one.
[230:17.36]There's two.
[230:19.06]Now let's make it connect, right?
[230:21.06]Pop them in.
[230:23.93]Aha.
[230:25.45]Done.
[230:26.41]Nice and snug.
[230:29.67]And it looks good to boot.
[230:31.01]What do you say?
[230:34.59]Holy shit, I'm still streaming?
[230:35.57]Yeah.
[230:35.89]We've been live for just under four hours.
[230:40.88]Usually a stream is between three and a half to five, six hours.
[230:45.30]I'm still going, man.
[230:47.50]Welcome to the stream.
[230:48.76]Thanks for sticking around.
[230:50.47]Thanks for coming in.
[230:52.87]Alright, that's done.
[230:53.45]There's a lot of these.
[230:56.39]Am I ever going to finish Rush of Blood?
[231:06.67]Is that the VR shooting game that is the Until Dawn thing?
[231:14.55]I don't think I'm going to finish Rush of Blood.
[231:19.77]Is that the last stream you came to?
[231:24.85]I feel like you saw that stream, got cryogenically frozen, and you woke up and you were like, hold on, he's live?
[231:32.92]Holy shit.
[231:33.44]Wait, hold on.
[231:33.86]Did he finish it?
[231:35.70]No, I didn't finish it.
[231:38.87]Finish Dark Souls 2, no way.
[231:41.81]I'm not gonna play through that whole game on stream.
[231:47.85]Am I gonna finish Stalker?
[231:49.05]No, you guys, your cryogenic tubes are all up.
[231:54.21]Somebody asked what am I building, this is a motorcycle.
[232:01.34]Am I gonna finish Dark Souls without dying to Pinwheel?
[232:12.48]That doesn't even deserve a response.
[232:14.04]A lot of folds.
[232:20.07]Just get them all... Ugh, my eye is itchy.
[232:27.53]Fold them all up.
[232:28.59]A lot of tabs, too.
[232:29.38]There's going to be a lot of insertions here.
[232:30.82]I like this.
[232:34.60]But no, I mean, Rush of Blood was really probably one... That was probably one of the best VR games I played.
[232:40.34]At least for the PSVR.
[232:43.34]But no, all jokes aside, I don't think I'm gonna finish that game.
[232:48.70]Yes, I'm very, very sweaty.
[232:50.90]I'm sorry, nothing I can do about it.
[232:54.34]I would go buy an AC unit to go right here, but I'm only gonna be in this place for another, I don't know, not even month and a half, not even two months.
[233:07.15]I won't even be, the end of this, it'll be a waste of a purchase.
[233:10.66]Because of what I'm going to do with it.
[233:12.04]I'm moving in like fucking less than 45 days.
[233:16.58]So there really ain't much I can do about it at this point.
[233:22.75]Am I going to stream the move?
[233:23.95]No.
[233:27.45]No, I don't think so.
[233:31.39]Favorite game genre?
[233:35.89]Lately I've been really into dexterity type finger cardboard games.
[233:42.54]It's kind of a newer genre.
[233:46.46]It's an RPG system where you level up cardboard and you turn it into different things.
[233:53.95]It's kind of like the cardboard DNA simulations.
[233:57.59]It's really interesting.
[234:02.45]Honestly, my favorite genre is probably RPG with skill trees.
[234:06.86]I love skill trees more than anything.
[234:09.66]They really are so much fun.
[234:13.22]A lot of tabs here.
[234:14.16]Fold it up and around.
[234:15.22]Look at that.
[234:20.96]And tabs come up on both sides, right?
[234:23.46]Oh, all the way around.
[234:24.18]All of them.
[234:24.52]A little spider here.
[234:29.97]This one comes up.
[234:36.23]It's making a little tool belt box thing.
[234:39.49]Whatever the hell this is going to be.
[234:50.97]Snap.
[234:51.93]Snap.
[234:53.35]And snap.
[234:57.07]Cute.
[235:03.24]We built ourselves a weird little box.
[235:05.32]Yes, we have.
[235:11.74]Keep it consistent so you see it.
[235:14.19]Alright, now we're going to insert the handlebar, the L on the handlebar.
[235:18.81]And the L should be the face in the same way, which they are not.
[235:23.85]Now they are.
[235:26.07]So this just goes right in, slide it through, and that's it.
[235:37.70]That's in.
[235:38.88]Two more stoppers for, could you guess?
[235:44.38]This guy's insane.
[235:45.20]What did I do?
[235:49.54]I think I'm just chilling right now.
[235:50.62]I haven't said anything weird in like 40 minutes.
[235:54.14]I haven't said anything strange in like at least 42 minutes.
[235:56.32]What have I said?
[236:01.33]I've said nothing.
[236:07.15]He's a mentalist?
[236:10.05]Isn't that like an ABC comedy where this guy could
[236:13.51]read your mind and he solved crimes so they're all going in here so this is just going wait which way is this going is it tilted no so this is just going in this slot here it's it is tilted a little bit I think it's supposed to be like that so this goes in here and one on the other side do you remember the TV show psych
[236:44.70]Yeah.
[236:45.44]I never watched it.
[236:46.70]All those shows were the same exact show.
[236:50.49]Every one of those ABC, NBC crime shows are the same show.
[236:57.37]There was at least three or four shows that a guy had super brain IQ powers and solved murders.
[237:04.57]I don't know what they were.
[237:06.67]There was Psych.
[237:07.83]There was, wasn't there Chuck?
[237:09.87]Chuck had super powers, right?
[237:14.03]Am I wrong?
[237:22.31]Psych was funny.
[237:25.23]It was numbers?
[237:28.59]Numbers, psych, Chuck, the mentalist, lie to me.
[237:34.56]They were all the same show.
[237:35.62]Some guy had some weird fucking mental superpower.
[237:39.36]He was able to do one specific thing that solved every crime in the city.
[237:46.21]Alright, step two.
[237:47.25]This one's done.
[237:50.21]Making the right handlebar.
[237:52.40]So that's cool.
[237:53.42]That's the left handlebar.
[237:54.40]We need a lot of pieces.
[237:55.48]10 pieces from A and C. I think I actually need this one now.
[238:00.76]That's not wet, right?
[238:01.64]Okay.
[238:02.52]Alright, so I need this one.
[238:04.59]So I need 10 pieces from A and C. All of them from A. So the whole thing.
[238:13.59]Okay, no, they're not connected.
[238:15.01]Don't freak out.
[238:22.65]Psyche didn't have powers.
[238:23.69]He just pretended to.
[238:26.33]So he was the CBS version of crime show Batman.
[238:34.52]Although Batman doesn't really pretend to have powers.
[238:36.26]He just doesn't have any.
[238:43.59]All of them, right?
[238:44.19]Yeah.
[238:46.87]All of them.
[238:52.51]Get out of there, come on.
[238:55.25]Sheet A, done.
[238:56.13]Do you remember Family Guy?
[239:00.21]Family Guy is still on the air.
[239:03.79]That's not nostalgic.
[239:04.93]It's still there.
[239:08.20]A and C. That's not C. This is F. This is D. C.
[239:21.38]So almost everything from C, except for the big piece right here.
[239:26.74]So all these.
[239:37.20]One, two, the handcuffs over here.
[239:38.77]That one came out very easily.
[239:41.07]This big guy.
[239:50.88]Don't take that one out accidentally.
[239:52.14]Almost did.
[239:59.12]It's like taking ice cubes out of an ice cube tray.
[240:01.41]Sometimes it just doesn't work.
[240:07.75]Don't drop that.
[240:08.73]Fucking weird ass piece.
[240:22.50]I need these two.
[240:27.61]Give me this last piece.
[240:35.41]Come on.
[240:38.70]Finally.
[240:39.12]Jesus.
[240:41.60]This one stays in.
[240:43.44]For now.
[240:46.70]Alright.
[240:47.36]Ten pieces.
[240:47.98]Let's make sure we got them all.
[240:49.08]One.
[240:49.20]Two.
[240:49.90]Three.
[240:50.16]Four.
[240:51.51]four five six seven eight nine ten let's move the little ones over here for now good pro tip where you can tell us all the time that's fine and I know it bike lever and ignition which is this one
[241:20.12]All the holes.
[241:20.82]There are some holes that need to be punched out.
[241:29.31]Where's the fast forward button?
[241:32.43]Up here.
[241:34.31]Oh, do you mean that, like, as in for the stream?
[241:37.43]Oh, I don't got one of those.
[241:45.95]So that looks like this.
[241:48.59]One more.
[241:49.39]There's two up here.
[241:52.17]There's two little holes that need to come out.
[241:53.65]Come on, man.
[241:54.15]Don't worry, I'll sweep this all up after.
[242:00.05]I might be giving people anxiety just throwing this shit on the ground, but trust me, I'll take care of it.
[242:07.62]Am I on drugs?
[242:08.46]I'm sweating a lot.
[242:09.20]No, it is probably about, I don't know, I want to say like 102 degrees in this room.
[242:14.57]You got a fan going.
[242:15.89]Doesn't really do much.
[242:16.67]I had dehumidifier going.
[242:19.01]You want drugs.
[242:19.99]You're sweating a lot.
[242:22.85]It's fucking insanely hot in this room.
[242:34.81]Cardboard melts at 102 degrees.
[242:48.20]That was so dumb.
[242:49.24]I love it.
[242:51.53]Okay, let's keep going.
[242:54.57]Speaking of fan, I'm going to get this on my face.
[242:58.69]That's better.
[243:02.00]Yeah, this is just a hot box down here.
[243:03.86]And when this room down here was envisioned, I don't know.
[243:11.28]There was no AC that came in here.
[243:14.58]And I said, oh, fuck it, whatever.
[243:15.72]I'll be fine.
[243:17.14]And it was alright.
[243:18.20]It's been okay down here.
[243:20.52]But for some reason, this summer in particular, it's just been like fucking wet.
[243:27.21]It's just been humid every night.
[243:29.43]It's been at least like 50, 60, 70% humidity every fucking day here in the last few weeks.
[243:35.17]And I'm just wet.
[243:38.19]And the room is just hot.
[243:44.72]Good luck in Vegas.
[243:45.52]Yeah, I can't wait.
[243:46.38]Cause the humidity is like 6% in Las Vegas.
[243:51.20]It feels like 85 degrees in Vegas at 110 with no humidity.
[243:56.44]This it's like fucking swamp thing.
[243:58.64]If it gets to be 90 degrees, 80 degrees.
[244:01.08]Alright, let's go.
[244:08.32]Flip it.
[244:10.35]This way.
[244:16.06]yeah fuck humidity I'll take like bone dry bullshit over humidity any day of the week I hate that wet sweaty feeling it's the worst every time I've gone out to Vegas I don't sweat a single drop it's just it's hot out and it's hot in you know wherever you are but you just don't sweat you just don't pile up like fucking grease all over your face
[244:47.18]Let's go up here.
[244:51.38]You live in Vegas?
[244:52.56]It's monsoon season and the highest humidity has been 15%.
[244:54.90]That's fucking incredible.
[244:56.54]I can't wait.
[245:02.84]Dehydration heat versus sweat heat?
[245:04.58]Well, dehydration comes from sweating.
[245:07.58]You sweat out the water in your body.
[245:10.32]If you're not sweating, you're not necessarily losing liquid.
[245:14.14]You can store it in the glands.
[245:19.04]These little folds here, I don't like them.
[245:24.76]I'd rather 100 plus than 80 with humidity.
[245:26.58]Oh yeah, me too.
[245:29.08]Every day of the week, man.
[245:30.18]For real.
[245:36.08]These little small folds, gotta be careful.
[245:41.19]Do a Lego set on stream?
[245:44.47]Um...
[245:46.16]I feel like a Lego set would take way longer.
[245:48.26]Like, this is the in-between for me.
[245:49.64]I can kind of just chill and we can talk and relax.
[245:54.08]Legos, I would lose them.
[245:55.38]There's like 4,000 pieces to one of those elaborate sets in there.
[246:00.57]At what point are you doing a 2,000 or 3,000 piece jigsaw puzzle?
[246:06.63]Alright, those are all done.
[246:08.49]Alright, let's go.
[246:12.63]Would I do it for a Scooby snack?
[246:15.14]I was about to just do like the Scooby, like get involved and pretend I was Scooby Doo there, but I feel like that would be very, I don't know if people would think that was funny.
[246:22.68]I think people would like be like, so I didn't do it.
[246:34.04]Alright.
[246:34.46]Weird start here.
[246:36.58]This comes up and over like that.
[246:40.44]And this goes around and then it's going to, yeah.
[246:44.93]Tie into there.
[246:45.67]This one didn't get folded.
[246:52.06]OK.
[246:55.88]Down, click, and then it's in there, right?
[247:01.18]Sort of.
[247:05.12]Scooby dooby doo.
[247:11.18]It's not really feel.
[247:12.28]OK, no, that's in there.
[247:14.34]Just didn't feel that tight.
[247:15.98]Now it's tight, okay.
[247:18.83]Now this side, fold it in.
[247:27.45]And close it.
[247:30.86]Cool.
[247:33.04]Now this next piece comes up.
[247:34.64]This is the one slot.
[247:38.02]And then that goes up.
[247:42.08]Just kind of rolls like a burrito.
[247:46.53]Up to here.
[247:50.12]Then what?
[247:51.04]Again.
[247:51.38]Folds over and you got yourself a 3.
[248:00.16]Do a gambling stream?
[248:03.45]No, I would... Is that even legal?
[248:06.95]I think that's illegal.
[248:07.75]I don't think I could do a gambling stream.
[248:10.81]This comes up.
[248:13.71]that goes all the way around I like this look at how like interesting that is it goes all the way down connects here and then that's going to close it up right there look at this little package that's it that piece turned into this little guy a little dinosaur do a CS:GO stream where what do I open boxes why would I do that
[248:45.66]But it's not something I'm gonna do.
[248:46.62]Alright, this is the actual handlebar piece where the Wiimote goes.
[249:04.80]Play the actual game.
[249:07.54]This is the game.
[249:09.56]This is the game.
[249:14.13]Do a draw stream?
[249:17.53]I don't know how to draw.
[249:18.35]Where are you getting this idea that I know how to draw?
[249:22.03]I can't draw for shit.
[249:25.03]One more here.
[249:27.89]Bring back the pizza boxes.
[249:29.05]It was funnier.
[249:30.95]I'm not trying to be funny right now.
[249:35.98]We're making the motorcycle.
[249:42.16]My intention right now is not to make this funny.
[249:46.86]Hold on a second.
[249:47.38]Hold on, where's my eye slots there?
[249:53.14]Hey, kids!
[249:54.36]A cardboard man for Halloween this year, hey!
[250:03.79]Look at how sweaty I am.
[250:04.61]Is that what you want?
[250:09.77]You want me to do like a comedy show?
[250:15.11]We're just playing a game.
[250:16.95]We're playing the cardboard fold game.
[250:25.78]Don't worry, we're almost done.
[250:35.60]That was a little too much.
[250:36.50]No, it's fine.
[250:40.16]What are the results of the emote contest?
[250:41.78]We are doing that.
[250:44.18]I wanted to do it tomorrow.
[250:47.10]But we might do it Sunday instead, because I will be around for a lot longer on Sunday.
[250:53.32]So we're probably going to do it Sunday afternoon.
[250:57.08]We'll play a game.
[250:57.82]We'll do the emote contest.
[251:00.20]And there will be something else as well.
[251:10.25]There we go.
[251:13.43]Fold it one more time.
[251:17.88]Fold the cardboard into a good stream.
[251:21.79]What do you guys want from me?
[251:25.81]You want me to fucking break something on camera?
[251:33.85]Like, this is what you're getting.
[251:37.64]What do you want me to do?
[251:39.50]I want to finish this.
[251:44.26]I can vault.
[251:45.22]Jesus Christ.
[251:58.13]Ay carumba.
[252:02.31]Take off your shirt.
[252:04.46]Ay yi yi.
[252:05.00]Alright, that's done.
[252:27.43]Alright, I creased it.
[252:31.77]It's all been creased.
[252:41.45]How many more am I doing?
[252:42.23]This is the last one.
[252:44.27]This is the last piece of the Labo until we build the robot in like a week.
[252:51.27]Alright.
[252:53.05]Give me this.
[253:00.96]Is it making my back hurt?
[253:02.07]Why is it making your back hurt?
[253:04.77]Alright, hold on.
[253:05.31]That's a weird position here.
[253:08.03]So, dinosaur goes into this slot here.
[253:12.91]Right?
[253:13.17]Yeah.
[253:13.39]Okay, this is weird.
[253:16.27]All the way up to the head.
[253:17.05]Like that.
[253:20.10]Goes all the way in.
[253:21.26]Alright.
[253:21.98]You got me here.
[253:26.76]What the fuck?
[253:30.97]This has to come down into that.
[253:32.97]Where's the Bloodborne stream?
[253:38.32]Alright, now you guys are just fucking around.
[253:47.76]Where's the Bloodborne stream?
[253:52.02]When are you gonna take your pants off, right?
[253:54.28]Is that the next thing I'm gonna see?
[254:02.18]This goes up.
[254:06.14]Fuck, this was a bullet.
[254:12.38]Like that.
[254:19.21]These fold in the middle here.
[254:24.23]Close it.
[254:26.80]Do a yoga stream.
[254:30.23]I'm not going to do a yoga stream.
[254:31.45]I would hurt myself.
[254:40.09]It goes in.
[254:42.03]Just wait until I drive this motorcycle and everybody is like, holy shit.
[254:45.23]That was the best thing I've ever seen in my life.
[254:49.36]I've witnessed so many things, but that was the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life, was when that guy on Twitch rode the cardboard motorcycle.
[254:57.78]Just wait.
[255:10.93]Does the ignition work?
[255:14.52]I think so.
[255:17.82]It's moving.
[255:23.48]Yeah, that's got some give.
[255:24.94]Alright, that's done.
[255:30.61]So we got right hand and left hand.
[255:33.75]Left hand, right hand, right hand.
[255:34.79]Done.
[255:41.48]Now we're going to make two triangular arches.
[255:43.42]Both pieces are extremely the same.
[255:51.24]It's this guy.
[256:01.76]Okay, I've watched Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[256:03.85]Now I get the joke.
[256:05.21]Welcome back.
[256:05.81]Thanks for watching.
[256:06.51]Thanks for understanding that reference.
[256:09.29]Now we can continue the stream.
[256:14.16]That was funny.
[256:16.30]That was funny.
[256:16.90]That guy got me.
[256:17.48]Good.
[256:23.79]Half.
[256:24.09]Alright.
[256:25.19]So now this is going to go.
[256:26.15]Where's this going to go?
[256:30.67]Right over the R here.
[256:33.71]Right over the R. In here.
[256:38.97]Why would this go here?
[256:42.45]Just kind of sits on it like that.
[256:46.92]Upside down and then do it again.
[256:54.96]Finish the build with your socks on your hands.
[257:01.60]I can always tell.
[257:02.46]I can tell when chat gets fucking bored because they just start throwing out all this fucked up shit.
[257:11.93]I can tell that guy is fucking bored right now.
[257:20.75]No, I'm not going to do that.
[257:27.25]That's not, I don't want to do that.
[257:32.70]Not just because I don't want to do it, but because that's not going to be nice.
[257:37.42]It's been fucking hot down here.
[257:38.96]I'm not putting my hands in fucking like two wet socks.
[257:52.59]Oh, no, they're not, they're not, they're not like that.
[257:54.71]I just am saying just in case they are like that.
[257:58.39]Just in the small fraction of a possibility.
[258:04.33]Alright, let me build my fucking cardboard.
[258:07.69]Let me finish my motorcycle, please.
[258:09.67]Like, put car in microwave.
[258:18.42]Eat socks.
[258:20.24]Show penis, like that's how I can tell you guys are done with the Labo.
[258:27.46]But I ain't.
[258:34.34]Okay, here it is.
[258:36.16]This one's done.
[258:36.74]Now we need two of these round stoppers, which, where are they going?
[258:44.13]They're going into this slot first.
[258:46.31]One and then two.
[258:49.01]Same thing on the other side.
[258:59.36]I'm having fun.
[258:59.90]At least one person said they're having fun.
[259:04.90]Good.
[259:05.34]I'm glad you're having fun.
[259:06.24]I hope you're having a good time.
[259:08.72]Because I like this.
[259:09.86]I'm having fun.
[259:10.78]Even though this is stupid.
[259:19.04]I'm enjoying the cardboard.
[259:22.34]I never get a chance to play stuff like this.
[259:27.65]It's two streams.
[259:30.80]When do I get a chance to, like, take the two ears and stick them in here?
[259:37.72]Light the room on fire.
[259:50.96]I'm just going to play Labo for one fucking goddamn night.
[259:56.50]What's going on in here?
[260:06.88]Stick all the way in.
[260:07.86]Get in there.
[260:08.68]One stopper.
[260:10.14]Two stoppers.
[260:12.46]Good.
[260:13.66]And look, we made a little cactus.
[260:16.82]This goes over here now.
[260:24.11]Let's break him.
[260:24.85]You ain't gonna break me.
[260:27.71]I ain't gonna be broken tonight.
[260:29.19]I'm finishing my fun Labo cardboard stream.
[260:32.47]You're not gonna break me.
[260:41.56]slides right on there make sure you get it the right way up it'll be really awkward later if you don't that's the right way up right right here the trick is to match up the printed line with the one on the handlebar go ahead and slide it all the way okay so I had it right I had it right the first time don't question me game you're making me self-conscious
[261:16.50]there okay that's on that's lined up correctly does it go all the way down it does before we move on check that the parts are all facing the right way just to be sure which they are so this is fine keep going all the way down
[261:45.47]Pass the line.
[261:51.42]Everything's good, right?
[261:52.82]Lined up?
[261:54.34]Yes.
[261:56.06]Does that just stay there?
[261:57.00]Keeps going.
[261:59.64]Like that.
[262:03.62]Alright, now this is the funny shape.
[262:30.27]You okay there, bud?
[262:31.57]That's my favorite person in chat right now.
[262:35.96]Hey, you gonna be okay there, bud?
[262:39.20]I'm doing just fine.
[262:40.28]I'm having a great time.
[262:42.14]Hopefully you're having fun in this stream too.
[262:47.46]Just wait till I fucking drive 100.
[262:48.66]Alright, flip it over.
[262:51.18]I'm seeing this through.
[262:53.53]Like that.
[263:04.41]I'm wide.
[263:10.05]Crease and folds and folds and folds.
[263:16.75]Keep these up.
[263:17.69]Little submarine holes.
[263:20.09]Box it up.
[263:20.77]Okay, let's get it done.
[263:23.55]Do these last?
[263:27.95]I should make it a thing to do a Labo stream once a week.
[263:31.08]And just stare in the fucking camera while I fold
[264:03.66]That's hard to do that.
[264:06.28]I didn't ruin.
[264:06.92]I got the right fold.
[264:09.98]I got to correct.
[264:10.78]What?
[264:13.15]This is strange.
[264:16.89]Oh, welcome to the stream.
[264:17.81]Those of you that have been hanging out, thanks for hanging out.
[264:29.02]My name is Jerma.
[264:33.12]That's it.
[264:33.34]That's all I got.
[264:36.54]I really hope you... I am having fun.
[264:40.64]Okay, we've done two Labo streams.
[264:44.05]Labo stream one, everyone said how fun this was.
[264:46.75]Labo stream two, people are concerned of my mental well-being.
[264:52.90]What happened to the two streams?
[264:59.15]I mean he's folded 641 times.
[265:01.93]That's too many times to fold.
[265:05.37]Check on him.
[265:06.23]Make sure he's doing fine.
[265:07.31]God damn it.
[265:20.82]He's folding up.
[265:22.68]He's collapsing.
[265:24.54]I'm gonna start to fold into the fetal position in like two seconds and just be like, I just wanna play my game.
[265:37.73]It's the no music?
[265:38.65]Alright, I'm gonna blast the fucking music.
[265:44.99]Ha, is that more fun?
[265:48.80]Can I borrow some money?
[265:49.64]No.
[265:52.70]You can't borrow any money.
[265:56.20]I gotta stop reading chat.
[265:57.76]Everyone's just... Fuck with me right now.
[266:05.10]I'm just gonna fold and listen to the music.
[266:11.95]Can I have some of your hair?
[266:14.21]I told myself I was gonna not read that chat room.
[266:21.29]Alright, these are all done.
[266:22.11]All folded.
[266:22.51]Except this little piece.
[266:24.51]Yuck.
[266:26.21]Alright.
[266:27.77]We're good.
[266:28.11]We're ready to put it together.
[266:34.87]No, I'm not doing it louder.
[266:36.28]I don't like it.
[266:40.62]Preemptively get these ready.
[266:50.85]What's with the money?
[266:52.67]Why is everybody giving a bunch of money?
[266:55.09]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[266:58.36]That's a shitload of money just came in.
[267:01.70]Thank you to Cairo Toby just gave $100, first of all.
[267:06.58]Thank you so much, Cairo Toby, for the $100.
[267:08.34]And you say, doing just fine, having a great time.
[267:16.29]That being said, the Labo is great, but I literally can't pay attention to the folding without my brain melting.
[267:21.42]I'm going to drive this car.
[267:28.88]Just wait.
[267:31.28]Thank you, Cairo Toby, for the $100.
[267:32.98]I appreciate it.
[267:40.54]Thank you, man.
[267:42.28]And then, uh, Jerma, take off your shirt.
[267:43.94]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[267:44.84]Thank you.
[267:45.90]No.
[267:46.98]Uh, Flinch, thanks for the $10 as well.
[267:48.84]Flinch1031.
[267:49.76]Eat the cardboard or it's pre-recorded.
[267:53.18]No, I'll just pretend to.
[267:56.04]See, that's enough for me to prove that.
[267:57.94]I don't have to actually eat it.
[268:00.10]But thank you guys.
[268:01.53]I'm seeing this through.
[268:08.43]This guy's crazy.
[268:10.13]What was I doing?
[268:11.15]Oh yeah, folding.
[268:13.35]So these all come up.
[268:14.31]This collapses down.
[268:16.30]Wow.
[268:17.86]Remember how impressed everybody was when we did this for the first time?
[268:24.02]Don't worry, your suffering will end soon.
[268:26.22]The lab of suffering everyone's having apparently will end very soon when we're done with the motorcycle.
[268:40.75]Like your stream suffering.
[268:43.62]My god.
[268:48.30]I can't say anything tonight.
[268:52.34]This has to go down.
[268:59.89]Did it stay up?
[269:00.41]Yeah, it stays down.
[269:05.05]Yeah, I made the car already.
[269:09.24]Oh, that's interesting.
[269:09.82]These go down and in.
[269:14.65]Same thing on the other side.
[269:16.61]Maybe?
[269:17.43]Yeah.
[269:30.64]I can't even respond to half that shit.
[269:37.07]One more.
[269:40.63]Same thing on the other side.
[269:42.47]Flip it around.
[269:43.35]Do the whole thing.
[269:46.61]Snap.
[269:48.68]Snap.
[269:51.64]We only have a few more parts left.
[269:58.41]And then I'll do a Fortnite dance.
[270:00.47]Hey, would that be happy?
[270:01.29]Would that make everybody happy?
[270:02.15]Well, I'll do a Fortnite dance.
[270:15.27]OK, so now this has to go over here, straight through.
[270:25.30]That's correct.
[270:27.10]All the way down, and then make sure the label is correctly on here, which it should be.
[270:33.66]Yeah, this is the right way.
[270:42.07]Straight through.
[270:44.07]All the lines are lined up.
[270:47.17]Kind of.
[270:47.53]I mean, it could be better.
[270:50.75]Yeah, that's fine.
[270:52.33]It's all good.
[270:56.29]Now we fold these two pieces and we get stoppers that go down and up.
[271:02.59]Alright, what's your favorite Fortnite dance?
[271:04.52]Which one am I going to do?
[271:07.02]Am I going to do the Yippee Skippy?
[271:09.86]Or the...
[271:11.71]Oh, the orange kids, the orange shirt kid.
[271:17.93]Maybe I'll do the hell yeah.
[271:32.18]Don't make me bring out the new version of the Bane voice.
[271:35.26]I will.
[271:39.03]Yeah, I'm doing it right.
[271:40.92]Am I doing that correct?
[271:42.44]It's going to go like this.
[271:49.43]Goes in there.
[271:50.89]Correct.
[271:51.93]Good.
[271:55.19]Please, God, no.
[271:56.83]Oh, well, maybe I would start behaving.
[272:01.77]Oh, you know what?
[272:02.43]Fuck it.
[272:04.57]I'll pull out.
[272:05.61]I'll do the Bane voice while doing the Fortnite dance.
[272:10.97]What would you think about that?
[272:16.91]That's connected.
[272:22.61]No, I don't want to do anything.
[272:23.51]That's just me embarrassing myself.
[272:25.15]That's not me doing anything to you guys.
[272:27.85]That would be an embarrassment for me.
[272:30.38]That's not embarrassing you.
[272:31.68]That's making me look like a jackass.
[272:34.70]How would that be punishing you?
[272:36.40]People would just be laughing at how stupid I was and how annoying I am.
[272:41.45]That's not even anything to help.
[272:43.09]That just makes it worse.
[272:44.89]That makes it way worse.
[272:48.27]Is that correct?
[272:55.17]Yeah.
[273:01.23]Alright, that's good.
[273:02.67]We're all lined up.
[273:06.01]Good.
[273:07.71]Now we need some small rubber bands.
[273:09.88]two of them to be exact.
[273:11.10]Using two rubber bands, hook them around these.
[273:13.88]That goes from this little square peg here
[273:40.58]Not easy.
[273:43.64]I lost it.
[273:44.06]It's in there now.
[273:45.38]Shit.
[273:45.78]No, I got it.
[273:52.70]Okay, would you guys rather me do a Fortnite dance and pretend I'm really, really fucking into it?
[274:01.05]It's two rubber bands.
[274:02.25]What?
[274:05.19]Shut up about the Fortnite dance.
[274:06.99]This is more important.
[274:10.39]I got it.
[274:10.73]I got it.
[274:11.05]Jesus, I got it.
[274:13.58]Okay, two rubber bands around this.
[274:14.94]I guess you're going to beat this thing, but damn, yes.
[274:35.36]Again, my fingers are too big to go in here.
[274:40.12]One, two, come on.
[274:45.73]Two.
[274:48.29]What is this?
[274:51.17]Something just broke off.
[274:54.89]Something broke off in here and I can't get it out.
[275:02.28]Fuck!
[275:03.68]It's alright.
[275:05.60]A little tab broke off, it's fine.
[275:08.26]And that goes across to here.
[275:12.10]We're not done.
[275:12.76]Two more.
[275:14.34]Add another two down to the bottom.
[275:19.59]Two.
[275:22.95]So this goes to this.
[275:24.37]Let me just make sure I'm doing this right.
[275:30.80]So then it goes from here.
[275:36.18]Spin it upside down.
[275:37.76]Yeah, that's correct.
[275:45.37]Slip it around and around there.
[275:47.33]Good.
[275:49.73]Try it again.
[275:50.77]Don't break anything this time.
[275:51.73]Let's try it this way.
[275:57.85]Go in straight and then hook it.
[276:08.67]They are in.
[276:18.72]Come on.
[276:22.32]That's good.
[276:25.86]Done.
[276:27.78]Am I going to finish Godfather 1?
[276:29.58]Probably not.
[276:32.58]Not until we get back to the PlayStation 2.
[276:35.80]Tell you what I will finish, though.
[276:44.77]I'll tell you what I'm going to finish.
[276:45.71]I'm going to finish the Nintendo Labo.
[276:50.04]So that's done.
[276:51.90]Both the handlebars are ready, but there's a ways to go.
[276:55.43]You want to get drunk?
[276:56.53]No.
[276:58.49]Main body.
[276:59.69]Almost done.
[277:03.33]How disappointing.
[277:04.27]I might.
[277:04.63]I don't know.
[277:06.27]Let me finish my stupid cardboard game.
[277:09.52]Alright, this one's done.
[277:10.24]Here's the main body.
[277:14.44]He sounds so determined.
[277:15.44]I have to finish this.
[277:17.82]I can't just get four to five hours into a Labo stream, the last one for at least a week.
[277:27.21]I can't just get to this point and be like, hey, okay, I'm done.
[277:33.09]I'm done.
[277:33.59]So that's it.
[277:36.11]See you later.
[277:36.99]No, I have to get it done.
[277:41.02]I'll just throw this over there.
[277:50.00]No, that's not good.
[277:50.98]No, never mind.
[277:52.73]That's done.
[277:54.53]Put on some music.
[277:56.43]Tell some jokes.
[278:34.14]That just went into the computer.
[278:35.28]That went into the computer.
[278:36.10]I'm not going to get that out.
[278:39.67]That went into the fucking fan of the computer.
[278:49.71]That's good.
[278:54.62]No, I forgot one.
[279:06.71]Okay.
[279:07.75]I need the other pieces.
[279:14.01]Here, here you go.
[279:15.55]Let's take a look at the x-ray.
[279:17.75]Hmm.
[279:17.95]It says... What does it say?
[279:22.45]Oh, I see this connects over here.
[279:23.75]Yeah.
[279:25.58]It says the chat really needs to shut the fuck up.
[279:28.80]I think that's what it says.
[279:29.82]Can you tell me that, doctor?
[279:31.38]What does it say, doctor?
[279:35.82]Is that what it says?
[279:41.90]Alright, I've got D. D. Bolt the whole thing?
[279:52.71]Okay, get over here.
[280:06.15]That's it.
[280:16.29]Three pieces from ENF.
[280:17.93]Sure thing.
[280:24.80]This actually is almost done.
[280:26.80]There's only like two pieces left.
[280:27.94]They're throwing tomatoes out there.
[280:33.12]They're throwing tomatoes.
[280:33.84]It's like I got an x-ray machine to block it.
[280:51.61]The whole thing, right?
[280:58.96]Yeah.
[280:59.34]E. And then this piece.
[281:16.10]Take that out.
[281:33.92]Don't need this yet.
[281:35.78]That's it.
[281:38.24]Don't lose that Don't have rubber bands
[281:51.24]Oh, this is a... Okay.
[281:55.45]Not this one.
[281:56.27]The cheese grater.
[281:56.97]Alright.
[282:09.92]Let's pick this out.
[282:15.40]No, no cooking wine tonight.
[282:16.77]It's too hot.
[282:22.73]It's way too hot for that.
[282:32.52]I wonder if I can just fold it and it'll pop out automatically.
[282:34.94]We'll try.
[282:35.32]Here we go.
[282:41.92]Fold.
[282:42.94]One.

[282:54.98]That works pretty well, actually.
[283:01.07]Yeah, that's so much better.
[283:02.89]It'll take care of itself.
[283:12.48]Make a Labo house for somebody?
[283:17.34]Maybe.
[283:20.81]Use a cheese grater on your feet or riot.
[283:23.33]What does that even mean?
[283:26.75]I'm having trouble understanding.
[283:29.85]Okay.
[283:41.92]Let me have this.
[283:43.46]Let me have this.
[283:49.12]No, I'm not broken yet.
[283:50.97]I'm just fine.

[285:08.26]Then this comes across over here.
[285:14.19]So this needs to slide.
[285:15.71]Tilt this up.
[285:24.13]So this goes in like this.
[285:29.70]Like that.

[286:14.33]Like, take out the trash, leaf guy.
[286:17.60]Like, what?
[286:22.52]Blow the leaves.

[286:55.85]Now push these two tabs on either side to help lock everything in place.
[287:01.69]Here.
[287:03.31]Push them in.

[287:40.00]I felt really good.
[287:44.48]Alright.
[287:44.74]Time to check the accelerator.
[287:47.56]So hold the motorbike twisted.
[287:52.00]Can you feel the rubber bands at work?
[287:53.20]Yes, I can.
[287:57.04]Interesting.
[287:59.43]That's pretty cool.
[288:00.81]It works.
[288:06.85]Alright.
[288:08.29]We're on step four, no we're not.
[288:13.66]Extra thick stick.
[288:14.62]Alright, here comes the extra thick stick.
[288:21.14]Make sure you get it facing the right way and we're gonna roll the whole thing up.
[288:25.86]Jesus.
[288:26.20]Alright, so the whole thing has to be rolled from, so this is left, so this is left and right.
[288:35.08]Go up like this.
[288:37.15]Fold it up and roll it up.
[288:38.41]You got it.
[288:46.09]Fold that.
[288:53.99]We are so close to being done with the Labo.
[288:57.01]Alright.
[289:09.04]I'm not even done, though.
[289:13.08]You better believe we're building the robot, like, next week.
[289:20.02]Roll it all the way.
[289:20.78]Roll, roll, roll.
[289:23.90]Like this.
[289:27.66]Like that.
[289:31.80]Here.
[289:33.30]And then... Ah, shit.
[289:35.28]Okay, here.
[289:38.96]And then this tab, see what it looks like?
[289:42.24]What about the backpack?
[289:43.06]Yeah, we'll do that like next week.
[289:45.40]I think I'm going to get some cool off, period.
[289:47.82]For the Labo.
[289:49.36]Before you guys come and burn my house down.
[289:54.03]Is that going?
[290:00.37]No, wait, wait.
[290:00.87]Is that correct?
[290:04.15]Did I do that right?
[290:09.74]Now it's going to go even more.
[290:10.60]I didn't roll it tight enough.
[290:29.39]Is my brain not working here?
[290:31.27]Or did I have that correct?
[290:45.66]The whole thing tightens up, and then you get that piece here is what it slides into.
[290:49.88]No, it's because these aren't folded.
[291:02.99]Now they are.
[291:12.27]Here we go.
[291:13.85]Okay, yeah, it wasn't folded correctly.
[291:15.44]There.
[291:25.96]Same thing on the other side, I assume.
[291:32.50]Same thing until we get to the tab up.
[291:54.93]Don't do the bees we mean don't do bees don't eat bees I'm not gonna eat any bees bees are the friends of the environment.
[292:06.43]Why would I do that?
[292:09.19]Without bees your house doesn't stand You understand
[292:19.51]They're the ones that built your house.
[292:27.62]Okay.
[292:28.56]So like that, that looks good.
[292:38.66]Then make it, Ooh, make it a little sandwich like that and then tie it all together.
[292:48.32]Beautiful.
[292:51.96]Yeah, you guys didn't know that?
[292:56.16]You think it was a carpenter that built your house?
[292:59.26]It was a fucking bee.
[293:04.50]Fold this all the way.
[293:06.28]That goes all the way around into itself.
[293:10.96]That's strange.
[293:13.26]Just like that.
[293:17.18]Weird, but it works.
[293:23.87]Hey, we did it!
[293:25.85]Time to put Mr. Stick in place, push him through, and make sure you get him the right way around.
[293:32.30]So like this.
[293:33.56]Oh shit, I think I just broke it.
[293:34.94]Nope.
[293:37.50]So watch out for the tab.
[293:39.98]He might put up a fight, but you can do it.
[293:46.84]All the way, but even with the tab down.
[293:56.23]All the way down.
[293:59.27]Get in there.
[294:03.97]So what you meant to say was, we fucked this piece up.
[294:08.51]Sorry for screwing it up.
[294:11.02]Thanks for the hundred dollars.
[294:19.14]Bingo.
[294:25.10]We're almost there.
[294:32.25]Then the L and R matches up.
[294:34.97]Matches up.
[294:35.43]Matches up.
[294:35.85]Looks good.
[294:38.05]Now this... Where does it go?
[294:43.23]Right here.
[294:47.09]So like this.
[294:48.04]Wait.
[294:48.28]Hold on.
[294:49.98]It's just spinning around all over the fucking place.
[294:51.80]Hold on.
[294:52.40]Slow it down.
[294:53.68]You got it here.
[294:54.78]Turn it around.
[294:56.70]And then upside down like this.
[294:58.74]Okay.
[295:00.99]Now this little flapper, crease that and that goes up top, I guess.
[295:14.58]Snort boiling water.
[295:18.28]Would that kill you, you think?
[295:20.20]I think you would die from that.
[295:23.50]You would probably die if you did that.
[295:30.19]There we go.
[295:33.39]You wouldn't even have time.
[295:34.63]It would go up in your nostrils and it would melt your brain.
[295:36.45]You're dead.
[295:38.39]Alright.
[295:39.07]Outer shell.
[295:42.42]Give it to me.
[295:45.70]Are we answering my question or his?
[295:47.46]I don't know.
[295:47.86]Did you guys have a similar question about snorting boiling water?
[295:54.68]Depends on how much you did.
[295:58.82]Let's say like a cup.
[296:01.01]Like one cup.
[296:06.95]Would that go all the way?
[296:07.63]That would travel all the way up into your brain, wouldn't it?
[296:11.59]So we've got it this way.
[296:12.55]Our shell.
[296:14.57]So then it just comes up and folds over.
[296:17.77]Fold, fold, fold.
[296:18.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[296:24.68]Okay, so fold it off.
[296:28.44]Fold.
[296:29.78]Fold.
[296:30.26]Let's go speed run.
[296:39.04]Do you see how fast I'm going right now?
[296:40.52]Look at this.
[296:41.22]And I bent it.
[296:42.44]That was for you, guys.
[296:43.64]I bent it for you.
[296:55.78]That's done.
[296:59.17]I ruined it?
[296:59.65]No, I didn't.
[297:02.03]We're good.
[297:04.11]Middle doesn't matter.
[297:04.81]There's this one stupid little piece in the middle that has to come out.
[297:08.45]See ya.
[297:11.58]There we go.
[297:12.52]Flaps up.
[297:16.10]Up.
[297:20.71]There's a lot of drug talk here.
[297:24.85]What's with the heavy drug talk?
[297:26.57]I don't remember you guys being heavy drug talkers.
[297:44.86]This is gonna come out.
[297:51.42]Alright, let's go.
[297:53.16]You can fold these later.
[297:56.50]Actually, do it now, do it now so you don't have to do it later.
[298:01.40]That is a great candy, although it rips out your teeth.
[298:04.98]Do they make non-laters anymore?
[298:06.34]I have no idea, it's been too long.
[298:12.22]This comes up, folds in, and then snap it in there.
[298:19.18]And then snaps down too.
[298:21.36]Yep.
[298:23.33]I got it.
[298:23.73]This doesn't really line up correctly.
[298:27.51]Yeah, it does.
[298:28.85]Good.
[298:32.43]Microwave everything now?
[298:35.74]No.
[298:37.46]I'm not going to microwave shit.
[298:41.38]Bend back.
[298:42.44]Bend forward.
[298:47.02]Stick that in.
[298:50.24]Oh, I get it.
[298:52.28]It's like the fishing rod, but the other way.
[298:57.50]It's a sideways fishing rod.
[298:59.53]I see what they were doing here.
[299:04.27]Have I finished anything today?
[299:05.55]We did three before this, right?
[299:07.69]Or two?
[299:09.07]We did the...
[299:10.53]house, we did the RC car, and now we're doing the last one in the bundle, which is the motorbike.
[299:18.97]And then that's it.
[299:21.32]Is this the last piece?
[299:37.21]I can ride my bike with my handlebars.
[299:40.47]I can't.
[299:42.37]I would hurt myself.
[299:44.11]I used to try to do that.
[299:46.66]And you would always just do it and then the whole bike starts to shake and then you fucking freak out and grab.
[299:50.60]By the time you grab it, your whole bike's tipped over.
[299:52.44]It was horrible.
[299:53.88]I wasn't very good at it.
[300:06.45]Still streaming?
[300:07.07]Yeah.
[300:09.27]I'm just trying to make cardboard, man.
[300:13.60]And that slides vertically.
[300:15.40]You lock it with tabs here.
[300:19.10]Wait, what the fuck am I doing?
[300:21.46]This is not correct.
[300:24.48]Wait.
[300:27.23]This thing has to go like upside down like this.
[300:30.85]Okay.
[300:32.79]Red to red.
[300:36.35]Snaps in and then goes down the other way.
[300:42.59]Cardboard Junkie.
[300:45.97]We've only done this for two streams.
[300:56.32]This is only the second time we've done this.
[300:59.22]And you ain't gonna see it again for like another week and a half.
[301:08.33]Who am I wearing?
[301:09.87]This is Chantal Leon, I think.
[301:15.83]Something French.
[301:21.79]In there.
[301:22.69]Left or right?
[301:25.83]Fake?
[301:26.31]Oh, it's fake?
[301:27.25]It's fake, huh?
[301:27.83]Why don't you read the tag?
[301:30.47]I cut the tag off because it hurts my neck.
[301:33.99]Joke's on you.
[301:34.61]It's from Kohl's.
[301:37.11]Alright, now where?
[301:39.32]Oh, fuck.
[301:39.90]I closed it.
[301:41.32]I jumped the gun.
[301:41.88]This goes like this.
[301:48.00]I have to put the whole thing in here.
[301:55.91]This flips around.
[301:57.99]Tab comes up.
[302:03.65]Yeah, these both come up.
[302:07.33]Everything goes up in the air.
[302:10.33]And then in comes the fucking baby into the crib.
[302:16.57]Right?
[302:17.89]So let's go.
[302:18.41]I've got to get this right.
[302:21.29]So left and right.
[302:22.87]So if I get this, it comes up and goes, got everything the right way up, then it's time to insert the handle.
[302:29.10]Why would you do that, Nintendo?
[302:32.04]You had it the right way.
[302:33.54]And then now this goes in here.
[302:42.12]That's in.
[302:45.54]That's correct.
[302:51.98]Does this thing have to come up or down?
[302:56.96]Oh, Jesus.
[302:58.16]He didn't even let me finish this one.
[303:06.56]Almost done.
[303:09.59]This last piece, fold it up quick.
[303:12.88]And then I think we're getting to the last part here.
[303:15.12]We're getting to the nuanced part.
[303:24.86]After this, that is.
[303:32.44]Thank god.
[303:33.23]How many more pieces?
[303:43.06]I have no idea.
[303:56.84]There's that.
[303:57.46]Excuse me.
[304:03.58]Still in dumpus.
[304:09.42]Okay.
[304:12.08]Where's it going, boss?
[304:13.82]Tell me now.
[304:16.40]Where you off to?
[304:23.05]We going late night?
[304:24.03]I mean, it already is late night.
[304:26.85]I'm going until I finish this.
[304:28.81]Because I don't want to just stop.
[304:30.53]Like I told you like an hour ago, I don't want to just stop.
[304:33.50]That goddamn thing was $70 and the one behind it was $80.
[304:36.38]I will do this by myself if I have to.
[304:45.56]We all have to suffer together.
[304:46.78]Alright, so then tuck it all in.
[304:51.00]This.
[304:51.10]24 hours.
[305:00.95]No, no, I'm not doing that tonight.
[305:04.57]That's for another time.
[305:06.65]If ever.
[305:07.03]Flip that around.
[305:20.33]It's making a little duck.
[305:28.17]Okay.
[305:30.29]Finish it.
[305:38.56]Ashtray.
[305:40.44]Put the ashtray in here.
[305:44.10]Screw the ashtray onto the back.
[305:51.57]Wait, there's a left and a right here.
[305:53.83]Hold on.
[305:56.23]So that's right.
[305:57.35]Right needs to go on the other side here.
[306:05.80]Left, right.
[306:07.38]Left, right.
[306:08.06]Okay, so this goes in here and that goes in this side.
[306:12.44]That is currently on there.
[306:17.51]Once the left and right tabs are through, slide it down and lock it in place.
[306:21.91]okay that's in there we go I think that's locked in that feels pretty locked into me and the whole thing closes up you got it man I am so ready okay very cool
[306:55.12]Very, very cool.
[307:00.10]Good.
[307:02.77]The main body is complete.
[307:06.85]Making the tank and dashboard.
[307:08.71]Look at how close we are.
[307:10.17]We're so close.
[307:14.58]Almost there.
[307:15.68]F and G.
[307:23.54]There's only two more pieces here.
[307:25.76]This is it.
[307:30.86]But wait, I have this more.
[307:35.86]All of it.
[307:38.54]Done.
[307:39.22]See you later.
[307:41.20]And where's F?
[307:43.75]F and G. Oh, fuck!
[307:46.75]This is like a whole other sheet.
[307:48.93]No, okay, no, no, no.
[307:49.85]This one's just huge.
[307:50.87]I get it.
[308:04.66]See, it was, that was the whole thing.
[308:06.18]I think it was gigantic.
[308:11.59]Alright.
[308:13.17]Almost at the end.
[308:16.29]And then the piece from... This big one, there's just two, there's just huge pieces that's gonna get folded and snapped together.
[308:31.95]That's it.
[308:34.41]Even more.
[308:36.75]That's it, the last pieces you need for the motorcycle.
[308:39.45]Do you see, you understand?
[308:40.53]That's it.
[308:43.13]We can be out of this hell together.
[308:53.36]Don't touch me.
[308:57.20]Guy in a window.
[309:00.04]Just broke his jaw.
[309:01.22]He's dead.
[309:02.82]Focus.
[309:09.65]Let's store all the sheets.
[309:11.83]We're so close to finishing the motorcycle.
[309:13.52]Lay out this piece, print it side down.
[309:19.98]This one.
[309:21.30]Go.
[309:22.94]I can taste it.
[309:29.70]He's going to have another episode.
[309:33.55]You did this to me, Chad.
[309:35.49]You did this to me.
[309:40.97]Fold.
[309:49.49]These are nice and big, though.
[309:50.76]This really shouldn't take that long.
[309:52.10]And all the fucking round we've done tonight.
[309:55.10]And all the shit you've been talking.
[309:58.04]I've had a good time.
[310:03.16]Fold this.
[310:09.94]It wasn't me.
[310:14.46]It was only a handful of you.
[310:18.00]And by a handful, I mean like 600.
[310:19.66]Turn my look out.
[310:42.70]Whatever the turkey, oh, turkey.
[310:43.96]Alright, everything's been folded nicely.
[310:55.40]Alright, let's make whatever the fuck this is.
[311:00.74]It's a big piece, fold lines, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[311:13.82]So just simply fold over.
[311:17.97]This makes a box.
[311:22.99]And that comes around and snaps inside.
[311:25.81]Just like this.
[311:28.69]How do I not fold this one?
[311:37.24]There we go.
[311:39.26]And now we're over here.
[311:41.50]Ding, ding, ding.
[311:43.35]I can do that.
[311:46.59]Ding, ding, ding.
[311:48.71]That one's done.
[311:49.33]Other side.
[311:51.35]Here.
[311:53.31]Oh, the whole thing opens up.
[311:55.09]Don't put your finger in there, though.
[311:56.25]It'll fucking snap down.
[311:57.39]This is the mousetrap.
[312:00.71]Alright, hold on here.
[312:01.61]So now this comes... Where the fuck does this go?
[312:12.39]This...
[312:14.46]So here, remember Mr. Stick, this piece will cover up part of them.
[312:23.62]Okay.
[312:25.63]What's the purpose of this?
[312:28.47]Oh, Jesus.
[312:29.09]Okay, hold on.
[312:29.71]You gotta get one step at a time, man.
[312:31.05]It's time to use these two long stoppers.
[312:36.95]Where's the other one?
[312:47.05]He's making the Millennium Falcon.
[312:50.39]Long stoppers.
[312:57.86]Same thing on the other one.
[313:00.64]Okay, then what am I supposed to do with this?
[313:02.92]Now slide it all the way through those tight gaps on stick.
[313:06.10]It should be nice and snug.
[313:10.61]All the way down.
[313:18.71]This?
[313:18.97]I guess.
[313:24.43]That ain't working.
[313:33.77]I need to pull this up a little.
[313:47.50]What's with this big ass thing in the way?
[313:49.44]Ladies and gentlemen, he's starting to get a little bit irritated.
[314:00.83]What's the Half-Life for when he decides it's time to throw the towel in?
[314:24.34]Motherfucker.
[314:26.50]Get in there.
[314:37.24]Did it.
[314:44.40]Someone get the cheese grater.
[314:47.61]No, no cheese grater.
[314:48.99]This needs to be folded up, though.
[314:52.03]This tab here.
[314:57.25]Hold the side tabs around.
[314:58.83]Now this comes down like this, and the whole thing closes.
[315:11.04]Am I supposed to step on this?
[315:22.88]Alright, good.
[315:25.88]Yes, step on it.
[315:26.98]No, no, no, no.
[315:28.16]That's not what I was saying.
[315:30.40]I'm not stepping on it.
[315:34.24]Okay.
[315:35.28]That looks correct.
[315:38.23]One last little extension and we're done.
[315:40.97]Get out of my way.
[315:42.83]Move, move, move.
[315:46.27]Sweet.
[315:48.41]Folds.
[315:54.03]Escape 3 controller?
[315:58.75]I wish.
[316:03.37]I wish if only.
[316:06.70]Watch out for the cockroaches on the walls.
[316:09.54]They're going to get you, Jeremy.
[316:10.86]Yeah, I checked.
[316:19.93]I did.
[316:30.00]There's only one more piece there.
[316:34.04]That's where you put the switch.
[316:45.83]Two, three, four.
[316:48.89]Alright, make a goddamn box.
[316:49.85]Let me see.
[317:00.01]That comes around like this.
[317:07.24]Stick her in there.
[317:12.10]Good.
[317:13.82]Fold these pieces up, down, close it up.
[317:23.05]Last little stick.
[317:29.47]Good.
[317:31.18]Nice box, yeah, this is a nice french fry box.
[317:33.28]Okay, so then this spins around.
[317:40.34]Spins around, and this goes now on... Alright.
[317:47.36]Where does the french fry box go?
[317:54.70]Am I going skiing?
[317:59.28]Why did I make a sleeve for this?
[318:10.03]Alright.
[318:10.45]That's on.
[318:13.97]Alright.
[318:16.15]We're in.
[318:19.37]We're in.
[318:22.07]That just leaves the dashboard, and we're going to be sneaky here.
[318:35.55]That was the optional part.
[318:36.61]Well, it didn't say optional.
[318:37.59]It said do it.
[318:45.37]Alright, here we go.
[318:47.53]So then this needs to be folded.
[318:48.99]The sides fold up.
[318:52.64]And then it just kind of... Ah, sticky sponge.
[318:54.92]Bullshit.
[319:05.23]I feel like this thing's actually going to be kind of fun, though.
[319:09.39]I bet you this thing's fun.
[319:16.45]I bet you it's fine.
[319:24.10]Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick.
[319:28.50]A little piece in the middle needs to come out.
[319:30.82]Excuse me.
[319:34.26]Now we need these things.
[319:37.65]Where do these go?
[319:47.35]We're going to stick half of the sponge sticker on either side of the piece.
[319:51.25]So right to the left of that thing.
[319:58.93]No, don't be hard to get off now.
[320:01.21]I'm so close to play for three minutes on the fun game.
[320:09.11]Check this out.
[320:11.18]Fuck it, whatever.
[320:13.12]Alright, right there.
[320:19.16]My hands are so sticky.
[320:29.30]And on the other side.
[320:41.38]And then let's put it together.
[320:46.26]Tilt it.
[320:51.34]This one comes up.
[320:52.72]That one goes up.
[320:56.00]Ah!
[320:56.24]Turn the whole thing upside down.
[321:03.40]Let's slide the tabs in.
[321:11.72]Just like this.
[321:16.69]Uh-huh.
[321:19.07]He's doing it.
[321:19.69]He's doing it.
[321:21.30]He's getting it done.
[321:22.02]Put the little flippers up.
[321:36.29]Flippers up.
[321:41.25]Now where does this go?
[321:41.89]Time to fit this on the front.
[321:46.20]So right here.
[321:47.22]So this goes in the middle.
[321:48.22]Look at how clean this is going to look.
[321:50.58]That's in.
[321:54.93]This piece looks like one of the stoppers, but it works a little differently.
[321:57.23]Fold it to make two tabs.
[322:00.29]What happened to this?
[322:04.79]What did I need to do with this?
[322:09.91]Spare.
[322:10.19]Okay, good.
[322:12.27]Spare.
[322:14.21]Looking good.
[322:16.73]This is the noise maker, I'm going to assume.
[322:36.47]Get in there.
[322:42.59]Do it before I lose my patience.
[322:48.39]It's the wrong way.
[322:52.38]No, it's not.
[322:52.78]It's the right way.
[322:54.80]It's to go in the bottom first.
[322:57.51]It's happening.
[322:58.32]Don't blow it now.
[322:59.36]Don't say that now.
[323:40.84]It's in.
[323:45.64]Final tab, up top.
[323:51.30]Check it.
[323:52.18]It's done.
[323:52.60]Now he's gonna add the Joy-Con controllers and we can move, baby.
[324:05.06]What do you think?
[324:07.36]And you wanted to leave the stream an hour ago.
[324:12.29]You sure about that?
[324:21.48]We're ready to start.
[324:22.20]What, you have to hold it into your stomach?
[324:28.52]But why was that guy dressed like that?
[324:31.91]Why was there a guy in like a yellow jumpsuit?
[324:35.31]Was that supposed to be prison?
[324:38.82]Grab one handle in each hand and tilt them to the left and right.
[324:41.60]Are you tilting?
[324:42.62]Are you getting into the biker mood?
[324:50.81]Yeah.
[324:52.69]I'm ready.
[324:58.07]Everything's done.
[324:59.45]The last step, put it in the Joy-Cons.
[325:03.91]Got them both.
[325:04.40]Okay, Joy-Con.
[325:09.29]I gotta open this fucking thing back up.
[325:11.01]Insert the console itself into the motorbike's dashboard.
[325:17.21]Wait, why did you want me to do that?
[325:19.06]Open this up?
[325:29.56]Okay.
[325:29.76]So this goes perfect fit.
[325:42.50]This thing's blowing air on me.
[325:47.54]Okay, so this is in there.
[325:51.05]It fits pretty good.
[325:53.51]Yeah.
[325:54.07]So now do I close this up?
[325:56.29]I'm going to lock it into place at the tab.
[326:01.84]Why would you tell me to open this up in the first place?
[326:10.35]Getting fingerprints all over my Switch.
[326:12.26]Why would you tell me to unlock this?
[326:13.60]I'm gonna clean this with some kind of disinfectant.
[326:25.83]Okay, it's in.
[326:30.85]It's locked into place.
[326:31.69]Attach the Joy-Con.
[326:35.11]Are you ready?
[326:35.55]I'm ready, please.
[326:37.74]Before everybody unsubs my channel.
[326:42.40]So this is going to go.
[326:45.83]Slides in here like that.
[327:00.35]Just in.
[327:06.73]You got to lock them in too.
[327:17.24]Little shit.
[327:17.82]Alright, it's in.
[327:26.72]How far does it need to go?
[327:27.42]All the way in.
[327:40.53]Get in there.
[327:43.13]Okay, that one's in.
[327:48.35]I'm ready.
[327:48.71]Put the next one in.
[327:55.11]Which way does it go?
[327:55.71]This way?
[327:57.87]This way.
[328:16.31]Alright, that's good.
[328:16.95]That's in.
[328:30.71]We're done!
[328:32.85]Time to go.
[328:33.83]Let's play it.
[328:35.05]Are you ready to play?
[328:37.10]I'm so ready to play.
[328:45.12]Time to do the motorcycle game.
[328:46.52]Can you guys see?
[328:58.20]When playing with the Toy-Con, it gets your body to support it.
[329:01.12]Twist the right handlebar to go.
[329:36.33]Get on it.
[329:38.53]I'm ready.
[329:39.27]Start the engine.
[329:45.51]Oh boy, just see you later.
[330:02.85]Come on!
[330:05.09]I gotta get in first place.
[330:12.40]I was trying to kill that guy.
[330:13.62]Fuck no!
[330:14.14]Why are we looking at chat?
[330:22.89]Stop it!
[330:34.00]Just focus.
[330:46.74]Do it again.
[330:47.08]Do it again.
[330:47.44]Do it again.
[330:47.92]Do it again.
[330:49.70]Retry.
[330:50.04]Do it again.
[330:50.46]I'm gonna beat him.
[330:52.80]I gotta get into this.
[331:03.46]Come on!
[331:09.04]That's a bad idea.
[331:10.22]That's a bad idea.
[331:11.94]That's a bad idea.
[331:12.64]I'm gonna fall off and I'm gonna break something.
[331:14.40]So no.
[331:30.13]First place, then I'm done.
[331:37.68]Is that nitro?
[331:41.00]What is this?
[331:41.32]Is this a brake on the left?
[331:42.28]Yeah, that's a brake.
[331:58.71]Grab the nitro booster.
[332:10.94]This is kind of fun.
[332:13.72]First place, I win.
[332:19.82]I'm kind of wearing this down though.
[332:22.47]Play Mario Kart 8 with this.
[332:25.43]There's more than one race, hold on.
[332:36.31]I can make a track?
[332:43.00]What's this?
[332:44.82]Oh, third person.
[332:50.04]It actually controls very well.
[332:51.62]No, I don't... Why would you want to do a bird's eye view here?
[333:08.73]Who's screaming?
[333:11.65]There's a guy just yelling in the background.
[333:20.78]Alright, well, was it worth it?
[333:21.86]No.
[333:23.84]I mean, it was.
[333:24.44]The journey was worth it.
[333:33.10]That's better.
[333:33.52]I don't need the extender.
[333:34.90]This is if you get a big, fat stomach, you put this on.
[333:40.61]Final race.
[334:00.80]This is worse.
[334:01.30]Yeah, this is definitely worse.
[334:05.90]Do I have a fat stomach?
[334:06.79]Is that why I need that?
[334:07.61]I gotta beat the last race.
[334:27.81]I feel like this looks really awkward.
[334:29.93]I'm sure it does.
[334:30.63]Nice jump.
[334:35.73]Can I do anything?
[334:36.21]I spit on the screen already.
[334:39.26]Fuck.
[334:40.86]There's a huge wet spot right there that I just spit.
[334:47.81]Nah, I win.
[335:09.25]make your own track I think I have to beat everything hold on wait wait what's stadium stadium shoulder stream checking the toy cons okay what does it do
[335:39.10]I can just fly around on the roller coaster level.
[335:41.02]Ah, you gotta pop the balloons.
[335:45.47]I get it.
[335:45.83]Is this multiplayer?
[335:53.19]Is this multiplayer?
[335:53.95]Is this multiplayer?
[336:04.54]It does move well with you, though.
[336:08.11]I almost kind of wish this was the fishing rod.
[336:10.79]Like you stick the fishing rod into your stomach and then you can like cast like this.
[336:17.88]Spit everywhere.
[336:20.06]Alright, it's getting late.
[336:28.00]That, that was the Nintendo Alabo.
[336:34.03]Let's discover the motorcycle though.
[336:42.23]That's my little me.
[336:43.17]That's fine.
[336:55.01]There's like fucking cartoon characters.
[336:57.43]It's like... Now this is just like a learning experience.
[337:08.61]I don't need to see this.
[337:09.55]I thought this was something else.
[337:11.85]This is just like a, hey, isn't that interesting?
[337:13.70]Alright, that's it.
[337:22.20]I can't get out of here.
[337:26.80]Oh, I could put decals on this.
[337:28.96]Whatever.
[337:29.28]Alright.
[337:31.91]That's gonna be it.
[337:32.51]I'm taking the switch out.
[337:35.59]That means the whole thing turns off.
[337:39.89]Ugh.
[337:47.06]There it is.
[337:47.52]Alright, guys.
[337:54.81]There's the switch.
[337:56.37]All the variety kit has been done.
[337:59.69]That was a lot of fun.
[338:04.77]Thanks for watching.
[338:06.10]Let's do the... Hold on, let me move this.
[338:08.72]I guess these are extra pieces.
[338:10.74]What was the string for, though?
[338:13.42]We didn't even use this.
[338:16.40]It's been a journey.
[338:17.10]I will see you guys on Sunday.
[338:19.88]That's the next stream.
[338:23.76]Not doing the next kit.
[338:24.59]Don't worry.
[338:25.87]We'll be doing something else.
[338:30.29]Going to do the emotes on Sunday.
[338:32.53]Starting with that.
[338:34.55]And then there are a couple of games that I want to play that I haven't had a chance to play.
[338:37.86]So let me move over here.
[338:45.72]I'm going to sweep this shit up.
[338:50.12]I did say Saturday, but I forgot to also mention that tomorrow is my birthday.
[338:59.79]So I forgot what my birthday was.
[339:03.59]And sometimes, you know, you forget your birthday.
[339:05.19]You're going to go out for your birthday.
[339:10.88]I'm sorry.
[339:11.22]I just bumped the mic.
[339:11.80]It's not my birthday.
[339:22.86]No.
[339:25.37]My birthday actually hits in September.
[339:28.51]It's not tomorrow.
[339:32.25]But Sunday gives me the... I want to prepare something for it.
[339:34.73]Because this is going to be something that you weren't expecting on Sunday.
[339:41.43]And because it's 1 o'clock in the morning, I don't really have time to do it now.
[339:45.21]So I'd like to do it tomorrow afternoon.
[339:53.42]No, not Minecraft.
[339:57.25]So, I'll see you Sunday.
[339:58.51]Have a great weekend.
[340:03.56]And let's do the credits.

[342:54.76]Now, much love to you guys.
[342:55.54]Thank you, everybody, for continuing to subscribe.
[342:57.94]It means a lot.
[343:01.76]Thank you so much.
[343:03.63]Let's move on to the bits.
[343:08.59]We've got a lot to go through.
[343:11.75]So let's try to get through this fairly quickly.
[343:13.81]Because it is very late.
[343:17.84]It is 1 a.m.
[343:20.06]Eastern Time.
[343:25.31]So let's go.
[343:27.99]Fairly quickly.
[343:28.81]No, we're going to go fairly for real quickly.
[343:34.61]Thank you to Ivory for the $2.
[343:36.17]Hey, Jerma, I can't tell you how much I value your streams, no matter how large or compact.
[343:41.42]I've been having a rough summer trying not to be unemployed, but has been marred down since my diagnosis of ADHD last year.
[343:50.25]As an adult, it's hard to admit the frustration and even at times the looming depression when you can't reach your career potential.
[343:57.93]You have mentioned in the past that you have ADHD and ADD.
[344:00.45]I was wondering how you got your jobs and maintained them with the condition.
[344:05.96]I didn't.
[344:07.42]I bounced around a lot.
[344:09.12]I did a lot of random shit before I really started doing YouTube and Twitch.
[344:15.08]You kind of just need to keep yourself interested.
[344:18.52]It's hard to stay focused on anything.
[344:21.90]But the best way to do it is... Actually, I did way better topping around to jobs than I did staying at the same one.
[344:34.77]After about a year, I had to do something different.
[344:39.91]But I would just try to keep yourself interested.
[344:44.79]It's going to be fucking hard.
[344:47.69]But as a fellow AD, HD, and ADD, I would say do one task at a time.
[344:56.24]Don't try to do everything at the same time.
[344:57.76]It never works.
[344:58.62]As much as your brain thinks it will, it won't.
[345:01.40]So take it slow.
[345:05.06]But thank you.
[345:05.64]I wish you the best of luck.
[345:06.40]And thank you for the $2, Ivory.
[345:11.86]Thank you to Big Boy Meshi for the $1.
[345:14.04]Big Boy Meshi again for the $1.
[345:17.03]Hey, Jeremy, my friend and I created a seven second New Vegas video inspired by you.
[345:20.85]Would be cool if you took a look at it.
[345:22.17]Yeah, let's take a look.
[345:28.80]Thank you, big boy Meshi, for this.
[345:33.44]Oh, God.
[345:48.70]Well, that was pretty well done impression.
[345:51.72]If you want to take a look.
[346:01.64]That's awesome.
[346:02.84]Thank you so much, dude.
[346:06.81]If anyone wants to click it, there it is.
[346:09.71]Thank you, big boy, again for your $3 total.
[346:11.03]$4 total here.
[346:11.31]$5 total.
[346:11.59]Damn, dude.
[346:11.95]Thank you.
[346:17.69]That was a pretty good voice, too.
[346:20.33]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[346:21.81]You still owe me $20 from the last Labo stream when you spilled your drink.
[346:25.02]I didn't spill it.
[346:26.22]I bumped into the table and the table spilled the drink.
[346:28.42]I didn't do it.
[346:29.68]Something I didn't touch it.
[346:31.44]Something else happened.
[346:34.74]Thank you, Eefs, for the $10.50.
[346:36.88]My bits got cut off the other night, but I wanted to ask a couple of things.
[346:39.91]Sure.
[346:41.69]Will you or did you ever finish the recipe for pancakes joke?
[346:46.29]And two...
[346:48.12]Do we kill sub-Viceroy of Star of Britannia?
[346:57.20]No, we don't kill anybody.
[347:01.68]That's an old one.
[347:08.85]I don't think I ever finished making any pancakes.
[347:15.25]First you get two eggs.
[347:17.48]It's really easy.
[347:18.12]First you get two eggs, then you get two sticks of butter.
[347:21.62]And you throw them as hard as you can into the oven.
[347:25.50]And then just make yourself start crying your eyes out.
[347:29.70]And then 45 minutes later, pancakes should come out.
[347:34.94]I actually had an idea that I still think I might do.
[347:38.54]Where... You know the...
[347:42.28]The iron chef.
[347:43.90]I was like, okay, here's your ingredients.
[347:45.86]And this is what you're going to have to do.
[347:47.44]You're going to have to use turkey.
[347:50.39]It's like the two chefs go head to head for like an hour, right?
[347:53.11]One of the things I wanted to do was I want to set up an elaborate kitchen and do that where it was me versus somebody, some chef.
[348:00.97]And it was like, okay, I'm in like a chef outfit.
[348:03.34]We're there.
[348:03.68]It's iron chef or we'll call it like super chef or something.
[348:07.08]And when they unveil the ingredient, everyone's like, oh, and I got a couple of sous chefs around.
[348:11.04]I'm like, okay, alright, cool.
[348:12.06]It sounds good.
[348:12.48]Here's what we're going to do.
[348:14.56]And then when it's like, a la cuisine, we run and we grab the ingredients.
[348:18.10]I just grab a full raw turkey, open the oven, and throw it as hard as I can into the oven and close it and sit down for 40 minutes.
[348:26.04]The whole time he's running around crazy doing all these elaborate dishes.
[348:29.26]After 40 minutes goes up.
[348:31.18]I just take it out of the oven.
[348:32.24]It's a burnt piece of shit and I put it across like three or four plates.
[348:35.57]And the judges are like they have trouble picking who wins the competition.
[348:39.67]Because mine was very well made and it tasted great.
[348:48.43]That was one of the ideas.
[348:52.48]I'm talking like oven slams down and I like fucking shot put baseball throw it as hard as I fucking can into the oven and then slam it closed.
[349:02.04]And then sit down and just wait and watch.
[349:04.96]And they turn it up to 500 degrees.
[349:11.50]Maybe you'll see it one day.
[349:15.42]Yeah, the key is as hard as you fucking can.
[349:21.04]That's the joke.
[349:21.74]The joke is not even the fact that I'm sitting there in the Iron Chef competition, I almost win it.
[349:27.51]But the fact that I baseball throw a turkey into an oven.
[349:34.45]But that's supposed to be a technique.
[349:38.24]But anyways, I don't know how we got there, but.
[349:42.25]Sounds like a good way to burn you.
[349:43.29]Well, no, this would be an elaborate, we were gonna build a set.
[349:47.09]This was gonna be a fake setting.
[349:48.41]It wasn't gonna be in my house.
[349:49.55]It was gonna be in like an Iron Chef stadium.
[349:52.67]We're gonna try to get ahold of a kitchen or I don't know, something.
[349:57.48]It wasn't gonna be in my living room.
[350:02.68]But thank you.
[350:03.60]I think it was sly161 and eeps.
[350:07.94]Also, thank you iBags for the $1.
[350:11.20]And they said they called me a man bun manlet.
[350:18.44]Hold on.
[350:18.84]Were you guys exceptionally mean to me today?
[350:22.11]I feel like people were exceptionally rude tonight.
[350:26.41]Am I incorrect here?
[350:34.16]Am I out of line by saying that?
[350:43.89]Everyone was very mean to me today.
[350:47.77]And I try to retaliate as best I can.
[350:51.92]Oh, they were very mean to me.
[350:54.66]Alright, here comes the Fortnite dance.
[350:57.02]Here it is.
[350:57.40]Oh my god, did you see that?
[351:17.03]Thank you, though.
[351:18.19]Thank you.
[351:19.09]Thank you eye bags for the $1 Thank You superintendent Chalmers for the $1.
[351:22.97]This is why you're looking at Twitter of tweet of mine Why are you linking this to me?
[351:47.71]Oh, that's the house tour.
[351:49.17]I'm fucking stupid.
[351:54.09]I forgot.
[351:56.84]The house tour.
[352:01.50]I should do a house tour the day before I move out of this place.
[352:08.42]Hey guys, just doing a house tour.
[352:10.19]There we go.
[352:10.77]Here's the bedroom.
[352:11.81]Take a look at that.
[352:12.87]Oh, look at this, a new rug.
[352:14.09]It's really cool.
[352:14.95]Can't wait to check that out.
[352:15.89]And then I'm fucking, I'm gone.
[352:18.15]I don't go back.
[352:20.33]The day before I leave, it's just a bunch of empty rooms.
[352:31.42]Yeah, I think that's where the bed's gonna go.
[352:32.86]Maybe up against the wall there.
[352:38.81]And there's just wall to wall.
[352:41.01]No, never mind.
[352:45.27]Never mind.
[352:45.99]I was going to get real dirty there.
[352:49.81]But thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[352:51.35]Thank you to Banjo Boy for the $1.
[352:52.85]Hey, Jerma, it's my first time donating.
[352:56.67]Now that you and Star are back together, I'm wondering when we're going to see that weird game you guys are playing in the future from Patch Notes.
[353:04.48]Well, that was supposed to be like 150 videos.
[353:09.11]There's like probably 70 to 100 videos after.
[353:11.97]So at this rate, you maybe will see that video in six to 700 years.
[353:23.24]But thank you, Banjo Boy.
[353:25.22]Thank you, Eefs, for the $2.45.
[353:26.86]Also, seriously though, Jeremy, you've helped me like a metric truckload this summer.
[353:31.86]Shitty shit has been going down and your streams are one of my few safe places.
[353:36.11]So thank you sincerely.
[353:38.55]No, thank you.
[353:40.43]Thank you for even remotely being interested in something I'm doing.
[353:50.82]Including folding cardboard and defending myself from chat for six hours.
[354:00.83]I really do feel like half of this stream was me being like, no, hey, no, fuck you.
[354:05.01]Let me tell you something.
[354:07.80]I was like going back and forth.
[354:09.52]People telling me like, oh, you suck.
[354:11.00]This game sucks.
[354:11.76]You boring stream.
[354:12.90]And me being like, no, fuck you.
[354:14.13]You're a boring stream.
[354:15.57]That was like four hours of that.
[354:20.77]That was like three hours of me getting defensive and three hours of us like sneaking around my house with a spy cam.
[354:35.98]Chad gets mean when they're bored.
[354:38.58]Well, I didn't do anything.
[354:41.50]We did this like two nights ago.
[354:46.97]People weren't mean to me two nights ago, but that was an eight and a half hour stream two nights ago.
[354:58.58]I'm trying to defend $150 worth of cardboard.
[355:05.81]It's because you did the good labos.
[355:14.12]They were mean.
[355:15.12]I was just drunk.
[355:16.80]Really?
[355:18.06]Were you?
[355:19.06]Were they?
[355:25.37]They were?
[355:26.51]Was I just like drinking and not caring and having a good time?
[355:36.07]Okay, in my mind, we were all having such a great time.
[355:46.21]Nothing, I thought everyone was having a blast that whole time.
[355:59.38]That's so funny.
[356:04.54]That is actually funny.
[356:06.30]This is stuck in my own fucking world.
[356:14.07]Anyways.

[358:18.29]Yes.
[358:18.49]Yes.
[358:21.37]Yes, I am, and I'm kind of disappointed I wasted my $1 coupon for anime on that show.
[358:30.91]I like it.
[358:31.37]It's not a bad show, but... I feel like they're just doing the thing where... Well, I mean, we're going to have 700 episodes, so whatever.
[358:45.07]There'll be no development.
[358:54.26]I could I'm feeling it I could feel that happening but thank you though man uh thank you GarfieldTheMondayKiller for the one dollar garfin friends are still working on your book garf's gotta know if you want the combat system to be number or chance based like sorcery or completely text based like the scholastic books
[359:17.50]Also, some guy broke into my house.
[359:18.74]He didn't steal anything.
[359:19.44]He just took a selfie in my living room.
[359:21.80]And I was threw up reading this.
[359:23.60]And left a pic on my desk.
[359:25.20]Thoughts?
[359:28.56]Who the fuck is this?
[359:30.78]Is this like you and your girlfriend or something?
[359:32.74]I don't know who the... I don't want to like put these people on camera.
[359:34.80]I don't know who these people are.
[359:44.99]That's not me.
[359:47.59]That's not me.
[359:48.93]That's not me.
[359:50.31]What are you talking about?
[359:55.78]It is now.
[359:56.48]Are you sure?
[359:59.32]He didn't say it was you.
[360:00.36]No, somebody else did.
[360:02.92]Like five people said it was me.
[360:04.93]It's not me, but I don't know.
[360:06.13]Where'd you get this image from?
[360:07.21]I don't want to like put these people on blast right now.
[360:16.88]It's me.
[360:18.86]But thank you, Garfield.
[360:21.82]You may have taken this from somebody's wedding photography photo album.
[360:25.19]And I'm about to be like, hey, look at everybody.
[360:26.83]Let's laugh at them.
[360:40.33]It's about time to put Garfield down.
[360:47.48]Thank you, Rewalls, for the $1.
[360:50.38]Two questions.
[360:51.24]Favorite stand-up arcade machine?
[360:53.34]Favorite vintage Jerma joke?
[360:55.90]Stand-up arcade machine is probably the Die Hard arcade game.
[361:02.91]The beat-em-up.
[361:05.49]Or Gauntlet Legends.
[361:08.37]Favorite vintage Jerma joke?
[361:11.97]When I played Insane Aquarium as Grandpa, and it was like a 17-minute video where I made the same joke 14 times in a row.
[361:19.58]Thank you, iBags, for the $3 here in a row.
[361:23.12]They say, oh boy, recycled streamer.
[361:27.72]Silent.
[361:30.16]I listened to one guy to be silent.
[361:31.70]I did.
[361:34.48]Thank you, iBags.
[361:37.03]Uh the wombat from hell, thanks for the one dollar. Jerma my friend wants to continue streaming but has little self-confidence.
[361:41.03]She can't force herself to start the stream most of the time even though I and others enjoy her streams.
[361:46.03]She loves your content but it depresses her because she tells herself she'll never be as good as you- Whoa!
[361:53.03]After 88, yeah first I think- number one: you can't compare yourself- but is this fan being annoying here? Should I move this?
[362:02.03]Alright first thing is: you can't compare yourself to anybody.
[362:05.87]That's a wall... That's a brick wall climbing up with your fingernails.
[362:08.87]It's not gonna... You can't... Comparing yourself to other people will just always cause you pain.
[362:13.61]So... Do not... Don't think like that.
[362:19.24]Second of all, you don't have to...
[362:24.45]I think when people get involved in Twitch and YouTube, and they want to become this thing that they see.
[362:32.58]Oh, I want to be a successful, popular streamer or YouTuber.
[362:37.52]I want to get viewers.
[362:40.08]And the thing you have to remember first and foremost is you have to be ready to do it for yourself, not for anybody else.
[362:51.57]You have to want to do it.
[362:53.53]Don't compare yourself to other people.
[362:55.68]Don't say, oh, I have to be like that.
[362:57.96]I'll never be as good as that person because you can be as good as you and you have to prove to yourself and other people that you're worth watching.
[363:11.59]Don't ever get stuck in that realm of trying to be something else or trying to compare to something else.
[363:23.02]Just do the best you can.
[363:27.36]Because I guarantee you, people say this to me sometimes.
[363:31.98]They're like, oh man, how do I be like you?
[363:36.47]How do you do that so well?
[363:39.21]Well, here's the thing.
[363:40.13]I guarantee you that there are at least a dozen things that you do better than me.
[363:45.85]Everybody here.
[363:47.15]You know what I mean?
[363:49.32]Like, I could ask the same question for some shit that a lot of people do, right?
[363:56.82]There are so many talented people that it's not... I don't... You can't just live your life thinking that, you know, popularity and fame are the two most important things in the world.
[364:13.29]There are countless other way more fucking important things that I don't do and I don't know how to do that are way higher up on the scale, right?
[364:27.32]We're all better at folding cardboard.
[364:28.94]No, I am way better at folding cardboard.
[364:33.71]But to go back and, you know, not to go on like a tangent here or a rant or something, but... You need to, if you're having trouble streaming, the self-confidence comes, it's right there, it's defined.
[364:51.10]It comes from self, it comes from you.
[364:54.43]You don't get self-confidence from somebody else.
[364:59.02]You have the confidence.
[365:01.80]Don't put on a show for somebody else.
[365:04.40]Do it for you.
[365:04.94]If that makes sense.
[365:17.93]Just yourself.
[365:25.01]streamer gives bad advice to shut down the competition what no that's that's the best advice I could give because there is no magic eight ball way to do anything you know there's no it's it's hard to describe how to do a certain thing and then some of the some of you guys could say the same thing
[365:52.27]about some shit that you say or you do or that you work on it you can't just there's no end all be all correct answer just do the best you can do it because you want to do it and make sure that you have fun doing it because if you don't then you know maybe it's not for you and there are countless other things that you can get yourself into but just try
[366:19.91]Give it time.
[366:21.27]Work on it.
[366:21.73]Work on yourself.
[366:23.49]And see what happens.
[366:26.70]What if you want to rob a bank?
[366:27.70]Well, that is illegal.
[366:30.30]So... Don't do that.
[366:33.78]Streaming is not illegal.
[366:44.35]But regardless, hopefully that helps a little bit, WombatFromHell, and specifically your friend.
[366:51.05]Just do what you can.
[366:53.98]Have fun doing it.
[366:54.56]Just make sure you're not forcing yourself to do it for somebody else.
[367:03.56]Thanks for all the love after being berated all stream.
[367:11.27]You're very much welcome.
[367:12.43]Thank you.
[367:14.06]thank you super sale for the one dollar hello Jerma as a fellow scientist what are your thoughts on the recently discovered shape this is this one of those like uh the words that people are saying to make people make streamers say to laugh at for the meme this is the scootoid is that like a uh scootoid screw it screw a toad
[367:42.64]You screw a toad on these nuts, right?
[367:45.58]That's not it, right?
[367:53.42]So the screw toad is a shape.
[367:56.18]What do you mean it's a new shape?
[367:58.16]There are no more shapes.
[368:03.33]Let me see it.
[368:04.19]That's stupid.
[368:05.43]That's stupid.
[368:06.09]That's a fucking everlasting gobstopper.
[368:09.09]That's not a shape.
[368:12.48]A shape?
[368:14.23]Somebody did that in MS Paint and then just said, hey, that's a new shape.
[368:17.47]Don't you think so?
[368:18.31]Scootoid.
[368:24.97]It's a 3D shape.
[368:26.26]Now we're in three goddamn dimensions.
[368:30.96]And why is there a picture of a beetle here?
[368:38.11]Is this the shape of a beetle?
[368:43.02]Oh yeah, the Scootoid, based on the rainbow beetle.
[368:52.86]That actually, that kind of looks like a candy I would eat.
[368:59.62]But thank you.
[369:03.30]As a fellow scientist, yeah.
[369:05.54]Yes.
[369:07.07]Yes.

[369:21.71]Earlier it said, gotta go, Jerma, but this sucks.
[369:27.29]Should I eat the Labo on stream?
[369:28.85]What do you think?
[369:29.91]Oh, man, it's gonna be so crunchy.
[369:38.48]But thank you, mostly lost for the $1.
[369:40.12]That was your five grand.
[369:42.06]But since you talked, we reduced it from 5,000 to 5,000 bits.
[369:47.04]That's alright.
[369:47.46]You don't even give me five grand.
[369:50.58]What are you talking about?
[369:53.89]Thank you to Cool Cat for the $7.
[369:58.35]You should sue chat for sexual harassment.
[370:03.11]Anyway, keep up the high quality streams.
[370:05.03]Thank you.
[370:06.25]Okay, that's another thing.
[370:08.03]So, in my mind, look, tonight's stream, and even the last one, I've been combating.
[370:14.66]Like, people are telling me how shitty the Labo is.
[370:17.72]People are talking about, they won't stop talking about my penis.
[370:21.18]Like, come on.
[370:22.30]Of course I'm going to tell you to quiet.
[370:26.43]I look over at chat and it's just like, look at this guy's balls.
[370:29.85]I can't have that.
[370:32.47]Well, I actually want me to be like, alright, what are you guys saying?
[370:35.55]Okay.
[370:36.83]Talking about my sexual organs.
[370:40.07]Anything else going on here?
[370:45.97]Of course I'm gonna say, like, I'm gonna hiss at you guys.
[370:54.85]If you ride shorts that ride up your ass like that, you can't complain when we say, what?
[370:59.23]These are like regular shorts.
[371:06.19]Would you wear clothes like that?
[371:07.97]Okay, come on.
[371:08.71]Whoa, slow.
[371:10.35]Hit the brakes.
[371:14.95]You gotta hit the fucking brakes here.
[371:24.32]Maybe your ass was in a black hole.
[371:29.24]Oh my god.
[371:37.10]I'm going to handle this shit right now.
[371:41.94]What the fuck?
[371:48.00]Oh my god.
[371:49.79]Alright, I'm just going to move on and say, alright, that was a thing we saw.
[371:59.61]Oh my god.
[372:12.78]Oh my fucking lord.
[372:15.79]You know, there's a level of, like, bullshittery and, like, memery and fuckery, right?
[372:22.35]You got a pitcher full of it, and you got a glass.
[372:25.41]That glass can hold, like, 16 ounces of bullshit, right?
[372:30.65]Don't turn the whole pitcher over and hold the pitcher over until it's all over the counter.
[372:35.67]You gotta fill the glass with 16 ounces of bullshit.
[372:40.44]I opened that glass.
[372:42.91]That's where you can be easy.
[372:51.21]You can't spill it all.
[372:59.34]Anyways.
[373:00.88]Thank you, Cool Cat, for the $7.
[373:04.74]Thank you, Mostly Lost, for the $1.
[373:06.40]Recycling jokes is our specialty.
[373:07.94]Don't knock us for it.
[373:13.87]Yeah, you guys dumped on the counter today.
[373:16.91]Not only that, you took the fucking meme juice out of the fridge.
[373:21.13]You dumped the whole thing on the counter.
[373:23.12]All the glass filled up.
[373:24.92]And then for some reason, you were like, hmm, what else should I do?
[373:28.36]You grabbed the fridge and you just took the fridge and you capsized the fucking meme fridge.
[373:33.92]You knocked it over onto the counter and it broke the fucking granite.
[373:39.63]And then you had this look on your face like, wait, what?
[373:42.56]What happened?
[373:44.28]I need more.
[373:45.30]I need more.
[373:52.89]Did I do that?
[374:00.83]I didn't do any of that.
[374:01.69]I just enjoyed a calm stream while I played Civ.
[374:05.33]Look it.
[374:05.85]See?
[374:06.81]And some people are just looking on going, what the heck, mate?
[374:09.89]What the heck, mate?
[374:30.62]And this guy, this guy over here says, it says one thing.
[374:35.28]I say, hey, like, hey, what does the x-ray say?
[374:38.50]Oh, you guys should shut the fuck up, right?
[374:40.70]Jokey, jokey.
[374:42.89]And then all of a sudden it's like, holy shit, let's burn the guy's house down.
[374:49.93]And that's when it went off the rails.
[374:56.76]It was jokey.
[374:57.38]It was fun.
[374:57.90]It was funny.
[374:58.34]I held up a fake x-ray pretending to be a fake doctor.
[375:01.62]It was a good bit.
[375:26.19]Anyways, it's too late for this.
[375:28.83]I gotta keep going.
[375:31.05]Thank you.
[375:31.61]Most of the loss for the $1.
[375:32.35]Nintendo Labo, more like Nintendo Dildo.
[375:36.85]Oh man, I can't get away from it.
[375:39.85]There's no escaping it.
[375:41.85]What do I do?
[375:45.39]Thank you.
[375:45.81]Upward Furn for the $1.
[375:46.70]Do the next folds as fast as you can.
[375:50.82]Just wait till I make the proton pack.
[375:53.83]People are going to suffer through that one.
[375:55.15]That's going to be like a 12-hour stream.
[375:59.01]Captain Scruffy, thanks for the three bucks.
[376:01.49]Thank you.
[376:02.15]No message, but thank you, dude.
[376:04.99]Asbestos Flask, thank you for the five dollars.
[376:08.28]Some behavioral psychologists think that we hold weird faces while focusing because our face muscles use some of the brain's processing power.
[376:16.12]Holding an expression frees up our concentration.
[376:25.42]There you go.
[376:25.88]There's your answer.
[376:27.84]Thanks for the explanation.
[376:30.54]Citation needed.
[376:31.42]No, that's correct.
[376:34.22]Thank you, though, asbestos.
[376:35.11]Thank you, Verda Quid, for the two bucks.
[376:37.89]Hey, Jerma, it's me, a thankful fan.
[376:39.87]I'm glad I've been able to watch you stream when you do because your content and humor are both so great to be an audience to.
[376:45.22]The recent events revolving around the reunion has made me excited about what's to come on your channel.
[376:50.14]My favorite channel ever.
[376:51.82]P.S.
[376:52.06]Since I plan to become a more frequent BitBoy, you can pronounce my name like Verdict.
[376:58.72]Okay.
[377:00.42]So, is it Verdiquid?
[377:03.16]Verdictquid?
[377:04.30]Which is Verdict.
[377:06.80]Verdict.
[377:08.44]Sounds good, man.
[377:09.84]Thank you for the $2 and hope to see you around.
[377:16.81]Yashi Kirakuna.
[377:20.73]Thanks for the $5 here.
[377:22.57]Hi, Jermamino, my friends.
[377:23.97]Klaus Sables Muna and Sin.
[377:28.18]Hope you aren't having any trouble folding cardboard.
[377:31.86]And we all love you very much.
[377:34.58]Thank you, Yashi.
[377:37.28]And thank you to all those other people.
[377:39.42]Thank you.
[377:42.49]Bacon Pancake, man, thanks for the $1.
[377:44.57]Clue the Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[377:46.09]It is a clip.
[377:48.29]Nice bulge.
[377:50.83]Oh, you said that?
[377:51.99]You're grounded.
[377:53.41]Nice bulge.
[377:58.51]It's hard, man.
[378:03.04]It's true.
[378:04.26]It's true.
[378:04.80]You would be grounded if your mother heard you say that.
[378:08.80]Hey, Plasma Dolphin, thanks for the $1.
[378:10.64]Hole of Wands, I'll be thanks for the $1.
[378:13.60]Next time you feel self-conscious on cam, just wear a sack and cut some eye holes in it.
[378:18.99]No, it's not my face that I'm concerned about.
[378:20.81]There's nothing to do with it.
[378:23.09]I don't give a shit.
[378:23.83]I don't care what I look like up top.
[378:30.41]Okay, stop it.
[378:32.21]Wizard, thank you.
[378:34.01]Wizard.
[378:36.22]Wizard, thanks for the $1.
[378:38.10]Jerma's definition of fun differs greatly from my own.
[378:46.59]thank you surplus by burger flipper for the one dollar uh I'm asking because you said you like it a lot we're talking about Bloodborne hey Jeremy recently been playing through Bloodborne and I can see why you like it so much unfortunately I didn't go in completely blind I'm up to Jerma who I've been told is the final boss but I can't help but feel I've missed out on like 50 of the game I've only found like six weapons also I haven't done the DLC because I have no idea where it is
[379:15.47]Welcome to fucking FromSoftware.
[379:18.67]That's the worst thing.
[379:20.87]The worst part about FromSoftware is the DLC.
[379:22.93]If you don't look it up, if you want to just go in blind, good luck.
[379:27.15]Good luck.
[379:29.83]But six, I mean, there are much fewer weapons in Bloodborne than there are in any of the Dark Souls games.
[379:38.42]It's because they all are kind of two weapons at the same time.
[379:42.00]So, saliva.
[379:43.12]Yep.
[379:45.84]Should you kill Gehrman and do it later?
[379:48.91]I think the DLC is actually fairly endgame stuff.
[379:56.23]How do you get to the DLC?
[379:59.71]I forget.
[380:05.53]Somebody in the Discord.
[380:06.47]If you hop in the Discord, somebody link the Discord, somebody will definitely help you, SuperSpyBurgerFlipper.
[380:14.45]Because I kind of forget how you do that.
[380:16.09]I know you have to get grabbed by one of the monsters, right?
[380:21.81]But what is my favorite weapon or area in any Souls game?
[380:27.21]That's a tough one.
[380:27.97]Favorite area or any weapon?
[380:29.49]I mean, favorite area is probably the research facility in Bloodborne.
[380:33.19]That place is just all kinds of fucked up.
[380:34.79]It's so odd and strange, and I loved every second of it.
[380:40.06]And Ludwig is my favorite boss.
[380:41.30]That's correct.
[380:48.10]Thank you so much, Burger Flipper.
[380:50.06]Hopefully somebody helps you out.
[380:52.37]Wincerind.
[380:53.17]Thank you, Wincerind, for the $1.
[380:55.17]Hey, Jerma, use that flat side of the chunky pen or marker and run it along the harder-to-fold creases.
[381:00.87]It helps a lot and got me through a year of cardboard projects at art school.
[381:04.58]This is so much fun to watch.
[381:05.82]Keep it up.
[381:06.30]Thank you.
[381:08.12]Thank you.
[381:10.46]Hey, Holeof1zombie, thanks for the $1.
[381:12.02]Don't listen to that last guy.
[381:13.24]Just use a claw hammer or a high-powered drill.
[381:17.78]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[381:19.24]Statistic streamer tortures small being in virtual house.
[381:21.76]Screams of abject fear and terror.
[381:28.08]Hey, it's time for slime.
[381:29.46]Thanks for the $10, dude.
[381:31.88]Jerma had a blast watching Wednesday's VOD of the Dream Team streaming the meme streamer's stream game.
[381:37.77]Hope to see more stuff like that in the future.
[381:39.31]You will.
[381:40.53]Sadly going to miss tomorrow's emote results.
[381:42.39]Hey, you won't because it's on Sunday.
[381:45.73]But you illustrated something here.
[381:47.15]Let's see what it is.
[381:50.84]That's a great, like, realistic Bart Simpson.
[381:52.96]If you guys know what I'm talking about.
[381:55.89]That's a pretty great realistic Bart Simpson.
[381:57.85]Realistic Mario.
[382:01.19]Thank you.
[382:01.47]It's time for slime.
[382:03.97]And maybe you'll be here on Sunday.
[382:06.21]Tomorrow is Sunday.
[382:06.97]Well, I mean, like, yes, but it's Sunday, not Saturday.
[382:11.05]Erdemius, thanks for the $1.
[382:12.13]This is one of the most entertaining and maddening streams of all time on Twitch.
[382:15.89]This is probably my last bits for a while, but you always got my prime subscription.
[382:19.22]Thank you, Erdemius.
[382:22.42]Thank you so much, dude.
[382:25.56]Thank you, Luxuriant Hat for the $5.
[382:28.49]Combine for the $1.
[382:30.85]Sup, Jerma?
[382:31.37]I'm the guy whose dog was paralyzed.
[382:33.41]Just sending you some bits and letting you know that she's no longer paralyzed.
[382:37.33]She's a bit wobbly, but she can walk now.
[382:41.00]That is great fucking news.
[382:46.22]I wish her a full recovery.
[382:53.53]Great news.
[382:55.47]Much love to you and your dog.
[382:57.39]Thank you, Combine.
[382:58.93]Oops.
[383:01.22]Machete Mario, thanks for the $1 jigsaw puzzle stream when... No.
[383:07.14]No more puzzle streams.
[383:10.16]It cascades into people talking about my, like, balls.
[383:17.49]You want to do another Labo stream?
[383:20.51]I'm going to wear...
[383:22.25]I'm gonna wear like a dress on the next Labo stream.
[383:25.81]I'm gonna like duct tape my whole lower body.
[383:36.17]That would be worse.
[383:36.93]Just wear armor.
[383:46.48]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[383:47.94]I can't wait until we pressure you into playing Breath of the Wild and you realize how wrong you were to rile people up by calling it shitty.
[383:55.42]I never called Breath of the Wild shitty.
[383:58.17]I did not say that.
[383:59.69]And if I did, it was a very clear bit where I was a doctor pretending to be a doctor holding up the x-ray saying, you know, shut the fuck up.
[384:06.63]That was a bit.
[384:08.07]I never said that for real.
[384:13.69]But thank you, Darkstar, again for the $1.
[384:16.62]By the way, if these Labo streams don't prove that you are the funniest streamer out there, I don't know what will.
[384:24.63]I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[384:25.65]Thank you.
[384:27.23]Most of the loss, thanks for the $1.
[384:28.63]Agree with that guy.
[384:29.45]You're turning five hours of assembling cardboard toys into something entertaining and watchable.
[384:38.30]I'm so glad you guys like it.
[384:44.00]I'm having fun.
[384:48.56]Thank you, Maximus Jaws, for the $1.
[384:50.20]This rude dude keeps making fun of me every time I fail my Jupiters.
[384:53.58]Please send help.
[384:56.52]We hate because we care.
[385:00.93]Thank you, Maximus.
[385:02.13]Kyra Toby, thanks for the 10,000 bits.
[385:05.05]Thanks for the $100, Kyra Toby, again.
[385:09.55]Thank you so much, dude, if you're still here.
[385:12.09]$100 is a lot of money.
[385:12.67]Jerma, take off your shirt again.
[385:13.95]Thanks for the $100.
[385:14.35]No, that wasn't $100.
[385:15.01]That was $10.
[385:19.35]Thank you, Flinch, for the 10 bucks.
[385:23.31]Thank you, Wince Ryan, for the $1.
[385:24.95]You should just do a jigsaw puzzle next stream.
[385:27.21]Keep the cardboard theme going.
[385:31.49]You know what?
[385:31.91]Before we do the Labo stream, just keep this quiet, because I'm gonna rile everybody up the next time we do a Labo.
[385:37.80]Next Friday, when I do this stupid robot Labo, I'm gonna fuck with everybody.
[385:42.36]I'm gonna go get a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and I'm gonna dump it on the ground, and I'm gonna say, this is what we're doing.
[385:53.67]And we're going to do it for like 30 straight minutes.
[385:58.89]Oh, that's so bad.
[385:59.49]Because then we're going to actually go into the cardboard.
[386:04.26]And I should do it real quick too.
[386:05.46]I'm going to pre-assemble a 1000 puzzle piece.
[386:08.96]Jigsaw puzzle.
[386:11.72]And I'm going to dump a bunch of fake pieces on the ground.
[386:14.06]And then just like... Done.
[386:18.40]And freak everybody out.
[386:31.27]Puzzles are fun.
[386:31.95]Why don't people realize this?
[386:35.35]I could know I could tell people I told you I can always tell when people are getting bored on the stream Because it stops becoming about the things we're talking about and the things that they're seeing and it turns into like my appearance It turns into like how do I look today I
[387:08.11]You can always bet.
[387:09.75]Count how many sweat comments, hair comments, or balls comments.
[387:15.95]Combine them in a pot and Ster them up.
[387:18.50]And what you got there is you got a bored person in chat.
[387:28.77]Well, ass comments.
[387:29.61]Yeah, those are in there too.
[387:36.89]That sounds like an awful soup.
[387:39.73]Would you eat that soup?
[387:42.41]Hair balls and... And sweat.
[387:53.90]Holy shit, that would be disgusting.
[388:05.83]Star, okay, we gotta go.
[388:07.93]We're almost at the end.
[388:13.61]Thank you, Sticked Renegade, for the $1.

[388:29.36]Cheer, cheer, cheer.
[388:30.48]Been absent for the livestreams due to a personal vacation.
[388:34.16]That Bunker Builder stream with the ice cream shop was well worth the eight hours of VOD.
[388:39.25]It was the first Labo stream.
[388:41.93]Good to be back.

[390:15.31]I held on for a long time, though, I think.
[390:19.38]Thank you, Adventurer.
[390:20.14]Thank you.
[390:20.46]Mostly lost for the $1.
[390:21.24]There goes my anxiety again.
[390:22.68]Thanks a lot, asshole.
[390:23.78]What?
[390:24.68]What happened?
[390:26.14]What did I do?
[390:29.78]We can say whatever we want as long as we donate.
[390:34.20]Uh... Oh, the bits when I've written the subs, right.
[390:41.40]The cheese grater on the feet thing was just... I couldn't take it anymore.
[390:47.90]The chat was just a mess for like 45 straight minutes.
[390:53.34]And all of a sudden, I'm trying to compose myself and I see somebody say that.
[390:58.62]And it's just like, somebody wrote that.
[391:00.98]Typed it onto the keyboard and pressed enter.
[391:10.95]That goes through my mind a thousand times.
[391:16.71]But thank you, Mosula.
[391:17.76]Thank you, Ratuna, for the $1.
[391:19.04]Which one of the Labo games that you've tried has been your favorite?
[391:22.22]The fishing rod was the best.
[391:25.40]The piano was a little too intricate.
[391:27.80]Too many little pieces to twist.
[391:30.62]All that sticky paper, all the stickers, no.
[391:33.38]The fishing rod was by far the most fun.
[391:34.70]Because you got to actually make the spool and it tethered back and forth.
[391:39.56]There was some actual leverage on it.
[391:41.12]It was awesome.
[391:43.73]I played it for like four minutes.
[391:46.39]Yeah, I know, but that's alright.
[391:47.91]I mean, those games are not...
[391:50.64]It's not the game part that is the fun part.
[391:53.60]It's the building the thing and seeing how it all comes together.
[392:03.00]We will see just how elaborate the robot one is next week.
[392:11.01]Hey, thank you, Devlon2Million for the $1.
[392:12.69]Hey, Jerem, I've been sitting on the idea of cooking a dish of coffee-marinated, Cheeto-battered fried chicken just for the joke.
[392:18.31]Please talk me down.
[392:20.31]Okay.
[392:21.89]Uh, don't do that.
[392:22.51]That will be gross, and anybody you feed that to will be angry with you.
[392:29.70]I just snotted because of that.
[392:32.14]Thank you, uh, DevLon.
[392:34.42]Thank you, Adventurer, for the $1.
[392:35.76]You should do a stream where you use a bunch of shitty spy gear and play shitty spy games.
[392:40.29]Also, not actually sorry about trying to break you during the stream.
[392:44.59]No, it's all in good fun, guys, really.
[392:49.22]I know that you guys are just fucking around, and so am I. So don't worry.
[392:53.94]Everything's all good.
[392:56.05]I had a blast.
[392:58.37]But shitty spy gear... You know, I was actually... I bought a bunch of science kits.
[393:06.75]And by a bunch, I mean like two.
[393:09.60]I was gonna do this thing where we did the magician stream, but we did a science kit thing.
[393:15.68]And then there's also those dumb spy gear things.
[393:18.73]They're old, though.
[393:19.57]They're kind of hard to come by.
[393:24.81]You'll see it probably soon.
[393:26.49]That'd be fun, though.
[393:29.72]Two is too much.
[393:32.70]Hey, thank you, Seth.
[393:33.48]Again, thank you, Seth Orvin, for the $5.
[393:35.32]Also, I could have sworn you were going to break that thing over your knee the moment you put the switch down.
[393:41.45]No, I did the, like, smash the Labo joke two days ago.
[393:45.33]Three days ago.
[393:47.47]I can't use that one again.
[393:51.68]Thank you, Kaiku, or Kaiko, for the $1.
[393:54.58]Hey, Jeremy, I've been a fan of watching you for years, and you're without a doubt the best form of inspiration.
[394:02.74]Sorry, I'm getting, like, the hiccups.
[394:03.76]You never fail to make me laugh.
[394:04.64]Also, I made this, like, a week ago, and I'm curious as to if you saw it or not.
[394:10.09]Let's see what it is.
[394:13.03]This just in, breaking news.
[394:21.36]The short streamer known as Jeremy the Rat Elbertson was arrested yesterday for charges of first-degree murder.
[394:29.24]The victim, a Mr. Santa Claus.
[394:32.58]How short-sighted do you have to be to ruin Christmas for everybody?
[394:37.05]Apparently very, very short.
[394:39.57]That's all for today.
[394:50.94]Why do I have to be so mean to me?
[394:52.54]Why do I have to be so fucking cruel?
[395:00.62]What accent was that?
[395:01.49]I have no idea.
[395:05.25]That was like four accents combined into one, wasn't it?
[395:14.14]Jeremy the Rat Elbertson.
[395:18.20]Well, none of that's been proven, so.
[395:19.90]But.
[395:20.53]I appreciate the news clipping.
[395:21.59]Thank you, dude.
[395:27.70]TheAdventurer, thanks for the $1 again.
[395:29.40]Also, one of your streams introduced me to my favorite game, Darkest Dungeon.
[395:32.20]I wanted to know if you've seen the new update, Color of Madness.
[395:37.60]If not, you should because it's cool.
[395:38.79]I've not played Darkest Dungeon since the stream, or I played it on iPad a few days later.
[395:45.67]But I have not taken a look.
[395:52.15]Hopefully it's good.
[395:54.29]Hey, never trust a purple ant with a $1.
[395:55.81]They say dab now.
[395:56.99]Nope.
[395:58.13]Thank you, Parfolomule, for the $1.
[396:02.73]Hey, Jermbo, I have a flight in like a few hours, and I just discovered you alive, so I'm going to give you my bit virginity for good measure.
[396:09.47]Good night.
[396:10.03]Thank you.
[396:11.37]Thanks for the $1.
[396:15.34]Thank you, Coolest Dakota, for the $1.
[396:16.44]Okay, last time I asked, you were too drunk to understand.
[396:20.16]So, a gimmick with my series is that each planet is named and themed around a comedian.
[396:25.42]I.E.
[396:25.68]Planet Candy was a bunch of fat people.
[396:29.52]What would Planet Last Name be like?
[396:33.37]Well, Planet Last Name... Well, that's fake last name.
[396:40.05]Planet Last Name would be...
[396:45.13]A bunch of just children screaming at each other.
[396:50.03]All just incoherently yelling at each other.
[396:57.87]I think so.
[397:02.72]Probably.
[397:04.30]It's fair.
[397:08.06]Some of them are having fun.
[397:09.26]Some of them are doing their own thing, but they're all yelling.
[397:10.80]That's what it would be.
[397:16.22]I would say.
[397:20.14]But thank you, Coolest Dakota, for the $1.
[397:24.32]Thank you to The Adventure again for the $1.
[397:25.91]What do you think of my school game dev team name?
[397:30.83]The Byte Knights.
[397:32.31]Any other suggestions?
[397:33.47]I'm talking about a video game dev team here.
[397:37.09]No, that's pretty good.
[397:39.00]That's pretty good.
[397:40.38]I don't know if I would change that.
[397:47.11]Make sure you trademark it.
[397:53.84]Hey, the Orange Pyro Ranger, thanks for the $1.
[397:56.12]If you were concerned about the amount of episodes with something like BNHA, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure might be more your speed.
[398:02.76]Each session is like its own miniseries that has a clear ending.
[398:07.29]I'm using the coupon next year for that.
[398:09.51]I'll watch them all.
[398:13.11]I've heard that it is interesting.
[398:16.89]But thank you.
[398:17.31]Thank you, Andoxin, for the $1.
[398:18.73]Hey, Jerma, this might be my last bits for a while.
[398:20.51]I'm having a risky spine surgery on the 16th.
[398:23.47]Sorry, I might not be able to catch your streams for a while.
[398:26.59]Have any advice for a good recovery?
[398:29.15]And good luck on the move.
[398:30.08]Love you lots.
[398:32.48]Good luck on the surgery, man.
[398:36.22]We all wish you the best.
[398:39.38]And advice for a recovery?
[398:42.92]Honestly?
[398:43.30]A lot of it has to do upstairs.
[398:47.32]mindset just know that you have to recover try to your body is going to recover eventually right you can't rush it so I would say mentally mentally recover as well and don't forget to hydrate of course
[399:16.81]keep that in mind yeah I mean the last few times I've had a procedure done or I've had problems with illnesses or something it's you can't it's not going to get better in like a couple days like a day one day two days your body takes a lot of time so the physical portion is just going to happen
[399:38.48]The mental portion is the real problem.
[399:41.21]That's the one that's like, you feel like shit.
[399:43.59]You want to do something.
[399:45.21]Why the fuck is this taking so long?
[399:46.63]Why do I feel like this?
[399:47.75]That's the recovery period for me.
[399:54.48]The recovery upstairs is more important.
[399:57.26]Because your body will repair itself.
[400:00.76]Good luck.
[400:01.34]We all wish you the best, man.
[400:02.88]Let us know how you do.
[400:08.63]Never trust purple.
[400:09.23]Thanks for the $1.
[400:10.01]I said dab I Said No, I didn't say that I Said I said no Thank you though purple I appreciate it Hey, Seth Orvin.
[400:28.60]Thanks for the $1.
[400:29.38]Also.
[400:29.60]I want to add to the streamer talk a moment ago.
[400:31.42]I
[400:32.61]Don't just chase what's popular because it'll get you views.
[400:35.27]Make sure whatever it is you decide to do, it's something you personally enjoy.
[400:38.85]And something you'd be comfortable with continuing to do for a while.
[400:42.03]Longevity is more important than 15 minutes of fame, and what you enjoy doing may change over time.
[400:46.69]Every channel changes, YouTube or Twitch.
[400:49.11]Very few channels stay the same throughout their lifetime.
[400:52.07]Thank you, exactly.
[400:53.49]And that means when I build cardboard on stream, thank you for explaining that.
[400:59.05]Thank you for talking about that.
[401:03.72]He's explaining, he's making a great point here, guys.
[401:11.11]But no, that's true.
[401:14.73]Very good advice from Seth Orban.
[401:20.03]Hey, Stardust Crusader, thanks for the $5, dude.

[401:42.83]It's uh, hold on, it's an emote contest, let's take a look.
[401:49.15]Uh, it's him... freaking out, pounding his head and... Are you drawing these at this point?
[401:55.68]I can't tell if you're making these or if you're pulling these from somewhere.
[401:58.44]Are you drawing these?
[402:03.23]I don't know.
[402:04.43]I don't know what's real.
[402:13.73]Jeremy will like me if I join.
[402:15.89]I need to stop trying to crush my dreams.
[402:19.13]One of these emotes.
[402:22.35]The Garfield author is not here.
[402:25.73]And only a few more.
[402:26.51]Thank you, Darkstar, for the one dollar.
[402:29.95]I don't like you guys saying weird sexual things about me.
[402:32.59]I'm going to wear a dress next stream.
[402:34.81]No, I'm talking about like a thing to make it so I could just be an oval.
[402:42.03]I'm talking about like an oval situation.
[402:43.93]Just like make it oval around me.
[402:50.74]Thank you, Captain Morgan for the $1.
[402:52.14]You're a handsome streamer and we're just walls of text.
[402:54.30]We're jealous.
[402:57.02]I don't believe that.
[402:58.46]I think people are just having fun.
[403:00.62]Which is totally fine.
[403:06.02]Thank you.
[403:07.94]The Adventurer, thanks for the $1.
[403:09.22]You should get a custom jigsaw puzzle of the winning emotes and mix them all up and then make Etalyx put them together.
[403:16.12]That's elaborate.
[403:17.36]I don't know if I have time to do that.
[403:21.80]Hey, MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[403:22.96]Here's another dollar for the Make Jerm a Dab Kickstarter.

[404:02.38]It's going to happen on that stream.
[404:06.28]Nothing major, but it's going to be fun.
[404:09.22]So, see you Sunday.
[404:10.93]Take care, everybody.
[404:12.37]Ta-ta for now.
[404:13.09]Goodbye.
