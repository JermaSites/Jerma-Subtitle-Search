[ve:60.16.100]

[00:43.69]Alright, so, uh, yeah, because of, uh, of how just, just, you know, a little over the edge I am at the moment, we're gonna go back to an old favorite.
[00:55.59]Something I, I was, like, actually thinking about this the other day.
[00:58.26]I was.
[01:00.44]And, can I, hopefully I can hear things.
[01:04.34]Alright, let's switch this over to...
[01:08.58]Hey, would you look at that?
[01:10.84]Ladies and gentlemen, Team Fortress 2.
[01:13.57]That's right, TF2.
[01:14.31]That's what we're going to play.
[01:17.43]It's been a fucking very long time.
[01:19.29]Let me move this because I can't see that.
[01:26.00]Did you ever think you would see this again?
[01:28.44]Probably.
[01:28.86]I'm excited to watch you play for the first time.
[01:30.96]She's never seen this game before.
[01:33.48]So I guess we just queue up casually?
[01:36.02]How does this work?
[01:37.95]Anybody know how this works?
[01:40.31]Don't show this again.
[01:41.07]I got it.
[01:41.49]Whatever.
[01:41.83]Like, I guess just core game modes.
[01:44.06]Create party.
[01:44.58]You can just start the search.
[01:46.88]Well, I want to play... I don't want to play control points.
[01:49.78]I don't want to play capture the flag.
[01:52.38]We'll just stick with this.
[01:55.72]So they added like a man versus machine queue.
[01:59.02]Huh.
[02:00.84]That's interesting.
[02:04.64]oh yes but okay but first of all uh at the end there there was lots of money given and like guys like honest to god this is like this is the most money I've gotten like in like the last like two months or something like and this stream has been total nonsense like for real
[02:26.34]Uh, let me just go through it and say thanks to a few people, because I was, you know, my face was bright red, and I was just swearing, so.
[02:32.36]Uh, Swiggity, thanks for the 1500.
[02:33.58]Uh, yesterday was your birthday, and the actual highlight of my day was Nightwing breaking his ribs.
[02:39.68]Uh, you're my reason for being.
[02:40.76]Well, thanks a lot, Swiggity.
[02:42.12]That was, that was very funny.
[02:44.68]And that was really good.
[02:45.50]I'm glad you caught that right before the, uh, like, the dog shit stream.
[02:49.81]Because the dog shit stream happened right after that.
[02:54.50]Alright.
[02:56.36]Um, let's go.
[02:58.04]Somebody, I think Mittens gave another 100, Ruby gave 100 too.
[03:00.50]Like, it's just, you guys are spoiling the shit out of me.
[03:03.75]And now we're on Swiftwater.
[03:06.29]What, who are these characters?
[03:09.83]Should I scout?
[03:13.21]Oh, yeah.
[03:14.17]Yeah, yeah.
[03:15.73]I'm playing the scout van.
[03:19.29]This is the people that everyone says I look like this guy.
[03:21.51]And, you know, right off the bat, we're just gonna fucking bleed up the car here.
[03:26.16]He still got it.
[03:26.70]Ladies and gentlemen, he still got it.
[03:34.87]He still got it.
[03:36.43]Whip and milk?
[03:37.23]You get pee?
[03:41.61]Yeah, one of the characters has pee.
[03:44.05]What is my name on Steam?
[03:45.37]I mean, like... Oh, well, I think it's just like Fred.
[03:52.16]Uh, dude, fuck it.
[03:54.10]It's like I never left.
[03:56.58]It's like I never left.
[03:57.48]It's like riding a bike.
[04:01.34]I don't even play on swift water.
[04:02.66]And I, you know, I say that as if I play this game.
[04:06.65]I don't.
[04:09.17]I do not play this game.
[04:13.95]Maybe I should, maybe I should play this game again.
[04:16.37]Are you serious?
[04:26.48]Oh, he's dead.
[04:28.12]That was alright.
[04:28.70]That was okay.
[04:31.13]I heard you're playing TF2.
[04:33.57]Yeah, I am.
[04:34.95]Alright, so... This is Kim's, like, first time ever seeing this game, so... It's important to explain what's going on.
[04:42.27]Uh... So...
[04:44.02]There are nine classes.
[04:46.06]Each of them do something very, very specific.
[04:48.10]Okay.
[04:49.25]So, you have the support classes where this guy goes invisible.
[04:51.95]He's the spy.
[04:53.19]He has a knife.
[04:53.71]He backstabs.
[04:54.35]Instant kill.
[04:55.15]Okay.
[04:55.93]Sniper.
[04:56.75]Very self-explanatory.
[04:57.99]You know, you shoot headshots.
[04:59.67]Okay.
[04:59.99]Crits.
[05:00.91]Medic, which Medic is really cool.
[05:02.37]The healer.
[05:03.75]You know Mercy from Overwatch?
[05:05.35]Yeah.
[05:05.95]Looks familiar, doesn't it?
[05:08.04]Doesn't that look very familiar?
[05:09.52]Mm-hmm.
[05:11.36]Oh, shit.
[05:12.58]Yep.
[05:14.45]My sniper cosmetics?
[05:15.27]I don't even know what I have.
[05:16.36]Usually like Ana, though, in Overwatch.
[05:19.04]Yeah, Ana's... Yeah, I usually play Ana if I'm playing Overwatch, but... Oh, if people were wondering if you're okay after falling down.
[05:28.76]I didn't fall down.
[05:29.64]I was trying to get this stupid fucking chair for you.
[05:32.26]Yeah, thank you, by the way.
[05:34.14]And I literally, I thought I almost broke your, like, water heater.
[05:39.89]I was just like, oh, my God.
[05:41.19]I can't afford this, like, so.
[05:47.78]Yeah, my water, like, that water heater just throw it in the trash.
[05:50.58]Alright, my sensitivity's all fucked up.
[05:51.94]Wait, what?
[05:53.04]Who was it that, we were watching someone's stream last night.
[05:56.42]Not last night, a couple nights ago.
[05:58.37]Mm-hmm.
[05:59.17]Oh, we were watching, um, Glump.
[06:01.11]Yeah.
[06:01.31]Glump's stream.
[06:02.21]Oh, yeah, Glump.
[06:02.53]Overwatch stream.
[06:03.15]Mm-hmm.
[06:04.09]And I told her that I was mad at her that she didn't invite me.
[06:07.67]And then she invited me, and I was like, no, no.
[06:15.44]I'm not playing Overwatch.
[06:19.68]Overwatch.
[06:21.42]It's the sensitivity, fellas.
[06:23.04]Ladies and germs.
[06:25.06]Yeah, I gotta drop sensitivity.
[06:26.67]It's way, way too high.
[06:29.59]Oh, Jesus.
[06:30.31]Why is it up that high?
[06:31.01]It should be at least that.
[06:37.91]Now, how many... Do we have too many snipers?
[06:39.17]No.
[06:40.76]I feel like sniper is probably not the best thing to start with.
[06:43.78]I was doing fine on scout.
[06:44.76]I don't know why I got off of him.
[06:51.45]In Swiftwater, I haven't really, you know... It's been a while.
[06:54.15]I heard a spy, though.
[06:56.27]So, spies, if I... They go invisible, but if I knew where he last was, I could potentially throw the P on him, and he'll get covered.
[07:03.05]People can see him.
[07:05.09]See that over there?
[07:05.63]So, there's actually fucking P in this game?
[07:07.57]Yep.
[07:08.45]That's disgusting.
[07:10.09]So, do you see that?
[07:11.15]Yeah.
[07:12.02]Does that look familiar?
[07:13.80]Oh, my God!
[07:14.62]Does that remind you of anything?
[07:17.12]Tour of Yorn?
[07:18.56]Dude, that's... So...
[07:23.54]They have a lot of inspiration from Overwatch CF2.
[07:26.60]It looks like almost the exact same.
[07:31.29]Yeah, this is like a classic for sure.
[07:34.69]Oh, I'm going to die.
[07:41.22]It's alright, I'll body shot that guy.
[07:42.30]That's fine.
[07:45.22]I will change to... Mind equals blown.
[07:52.89]Overwatch ripoff, no.
[07:56.33]No, they're both two very separate games.
[07:57.91]They're both very fun.
[07:58.61]What am I going to have for a watch?
[08:01.11]Oh, that one.
[08:03.91]Now it's time to try to pretend how to play this game and play the spy.
[08:06.80]Okay.
[08:07.86]Spy-cicle, don't know why this is on.
[08:09.18]I don't even know where the hell they come from.
[08:22.85]Well, I got that guy.
[08:24.07]Easy enough, right?
[08:30.49]Game sucks.
[08:32.41]No.
[08:33.49]It doesn't.
[08:35.01]You know, I want to play Engineer.
[08:36.01]I'm, like, getting... I'm getting to liking to play this again, you know?
[08:41.94]I gotta get a backstab.
[08:42.84]I gotta get at least two.
[08:43.94]I bumped into a spy.
[08:46.26]This dude is dead.
[08:51.43]Alright, he's dead.
[08:52.33]I almost just really royally screwed that up, but it's alright.
[08:55.81]Why am I disguising as a scout?
[09:03.47]Now we're going to be a total asshole and, you know, wait for people to come.
[09:05.69]No, no, no, we're not.
[09:07.53]Don't blow up my spot here.
[09:08.41]Hey, don't blow up my spot!
[09:11.95]That guy's a friendly heavy.
[09:13.29]Alright.
[09:16.21]The nostalgia is biting at you.
[09:24.80]I would play Engineer, but there's too many.
[09:28.56]This would put a tear in Gaben's eyes.
[09:33.20]You know, I really just wish they did... When is that new shit coming out for this game?
[09:39.06]Couldn't kill a Friendly.
[09:39.90]No, I hesitated.
[09:40.76]I didn't want to kill the Friendly.
[09:42.98]That was the hesitation.
[09:48.48]Ow.
[09:56.35]So how long does competitive... not competitive.
[09:59.05]This ain't competitive.
[10:01.91]Spring, summer is when the new update is coming out.
[10:05.67]When... so how does this casual queue work?
[10:08.60]Does it keep track of stats?
[10:13.76]I have no idea.
[10:17.98]All I know is that... They're making new stuff for the heavy and for the pyro, right?
[10:23.40]Or at least the pyro first.
[10:25.93]Did I get a health pack for two health?
[10:27.35]Sam, it's been a long time.
[10:28.95]It's been like at least... Yeah, I probably did.
[10:33.54]I'm just trying to remember everything.
[10:40.92]Ow.
[10:43.00]I might have to be a medic, actually.
[10:44.28]I don't think we have one.
[10:48.34]Oh, God.
[10:50.02]Did you seriously just take that from me?
[10:52.60]Well, thank you.
[10:53.66]That's very kind of you.
[10:54.48]What are those?
[10:57.03]Are those, like, a reskin?
[11:01.32]Alright, well, I'm gonna... I have a sandwich.
[11:08.16]Oh, boy.
[11:12.58]No, we're good.
[11:14.16]Going back to my roots here, guys.
[11:15.84]Playing, like, cart heavy.
[11:23.54]No, you don't!
[11:25.34]Oh, that's a spy too.
[11:27.28]No, it's not.
[11:27.84]What?
[11:28.76]Where is he?
[11:29.08]On the roof?
[11:32.36]Is the eviction notice it?
[11:33.78]I thought the eviction notice didn't have spikes.
[11:38.77]Yeah, I'm going to be medic.
[11:39.65]I'm going to go and crit Skrieg.
[11:42.31]What cool shit do I have?
[11:47.71]I don't know.
[11:48.05]Do you like my outfit?
[11:53.80]No.
[11:54.76]I think it's a cool outfit.
[11:55.50]Let's think of Wilson here.
[12:03.69]I also like that you can see nameplates through walls.
[12:05.75]When did they do that?
[12:07.61]Was I still playing this game when they did that?
[12:09.85]I have no idea.
[12:14.95]Let's see.
[12:19.09]Take off the backpack.
[12:21.67]Whoa!
[12:22.53]Oh, come on.
[12:23.31]I seriously just get crit right there.
[12:27.50]I just got crit.
[12:29.32]I thought they were going to delete those from the game.
[12:34.64]I healed a spy.
[12:35.56]I accidentally did.
[12:46.29]Which one is it?
[12:48.73]Where is he?
[12:50.25]Which one of you fucking clowns is the one doing it?
[12:52.93]I don't know.
[12:53.72]Whatever.
[12:57.39]Oh, only in comp.
[12:58.15]Okay.
[13:00.55]Well, I'm absolutely not going to do that tonight.
[13:02.17]I can guarantee you that.
[13:07.88]Not tonight.
[13:09.06]This is just like a rage quit PSVR.
[13:13.00]Like, I hate my life PSVR.
[13:15.94]So, I'm going to play this.
[13:21.04]And by the way, I want to say this again.
[13:22.82]So...
[13:28.61]Sorry about that.
[13:32.13]We will take your feedback and we will improve.
[13:33.99]It says... Oh my god, I knew that.
[13:38.55]I knew that was going to happen.
[13:42.61]What is Shpi?
[13:44.56]It's from a series of videos I did like three or four years ago.
[13:48.08]And I said... Shpi.
[13:50.68]That was a long time ago.
[13:59.39]No, I don't want to revive the shpee meme.
[14:03.13]What is that?
[14:04.23]It's just like a... I don't want to know.
[14:07.31]Pretty much, it's like a TF2 thing.
[14:12.12]He said it.
[14:12.74]Yeah, I technically did just say it, yeah.
[14:19.44]I need to do a crit screen, though.
[14:22.61]Kritzkrieg.
[14:24.27]So the medic has this thing, see in the lower right?
[14:28.67]That charge that's going up?
[14:29.95]Yeah.
[14:30.43]When that reaches 100, you do it by healing people.
[14:33.51]That gets to 100%.
[14:34.27]You right click while your beam is on somebody and they get 100% critical strikes for 8 seconds.
[14:39.77]Oh, nice.
[14:41.65]It is very, very good.
[14:44.30]You do it to like a soldier, or a heavy, or a demoman, usually.
[14:49.14]Unless you want to do some funky shit.
[14:53.81]For instance, this guy is going to get it, and hopefully we do some damage with it.
[14:58.75]Oh, maybe not.
[15:01.45]And if he sneaks in here... There we go.
[15:05.37]Attack, attack, attack.
[15:07.25]Yeah.
[15:14.24]Yeah, she's not an avid viewer, guys.
[15:18.92]She's only seen a handful of videos.
[15:22.12]Direct miss.
[15:25.04]Revive TF2.
[15:26.06]I mean, TF2 doesn't need to be revived.
[15:27.54]TF2 is... I think TF2 is fine.
[15:32.28]I think when they say that, they mean they want you to start playing more.
[15:37.21]Yeah, but I mean, I'm playing it right now.
[15:39.89]Look, I never said, I never said I was gonna like never play this game again.
[15:44.25]You know?
[15:45.93]I just started playing PSVR games.
[15:49.08]You know, once you incorporate the move controllers though.
[15:53.52]Fuck.
[15:55.28]Watch old videos.
[15:59.64]They're telling you to dump me because I haven't watched any of your videos.
[16:03.93]Yeah, but I don't care.
[16:07.26]I actually prefer you didn't.
[16:08.58]If I'm completely honest.
[16:10.94]Now that you said that, I have to watch them.
[16:13.21]I'd prefer that you didn't watch my videos, because maybe you wouldn't talk to me anymore.
[16:17.75]You're gonna watch these shpee videos and be like, who the fuck is this guy?
[16:29.75]Watch my Minecraft videos?
[16:31.33]Oh, God.
[16:32.39]Don't watch my... Listen, none of you watch my Minecraft videos.
[16:35.62]Don't any of you ever do it again.
[16:38.00]I'll know.
[16:38.84]I'm going to go see how many views those Minecraft videos have.
[16:41.40]And I'm going to look at the view counter.
[16:43.76]And I'm going to be able to tell if somebody did it.
[16:45.08]So don't do it.
[16:48.39]Show her your old videos on stream.
[16:52.92]Eh.
[16:53.90]I don't know.
[16:54.28]That's... Maybe one night.
[16:57.24]I don't know.
[16:57.94]Like, not tonight.
[16:58.82]I'm not too... Honest to God, guys.
[17:01.95]I'm, like, too irritated right now to, like, do anything but just chill and play this.
[17:06.95]And I got almost top-fragged.
[17:13.46]Like that PSVR debacle drained like 99% of every energy ounce I had in my body.
[17:20.99]I was not happy about that at all.
[17:22.55]Not even close.
[17:26.65]I did Minecraft?
[17:27.21]Yeah, I did.
[17:31.62]Five bucks to do the voice you want me to do.
[17:33.78]Alright, here we go, guys.
[17:35.88]For old time's sake, I'll say it.
[17:38.72]I'll do it.
[17:39.14]And we'll put on the fucking dumb mask, too.
[17:40.91]Why not?
[17:42.31]Here's your TF2 reunion show, okay?
[17:44.83]I don't even have it.
[17:50.31]I don't even have it.
[17:51.01]I think Star bought that for me.
[17:52.72]No, he didn't.
[17:53.26]I did.
[17:53.60]No, I didn't.
[17:53.96]It's not even here.
[17:54.40]Alright, here it is.
[17:54.96]There you go.
[17:57.76]Maybe I do have it.
[18:02.61]What was it?
[18:03.00]Empty, right?
[18:03.56]Yeah.
[18:04.32]There you go.
[18:06.22]Did somebody clip it?
[18:07.36]Oh, God.
[18:11.20]Hey, look at it.
[18:13.41]It's me!
[18:14.87]The Pirate Spy!
[18:17.11]There.
[18:18.67]There's your, like... There's your video nostalgia trip.
[18:30.91]Oh, this guy already died.
[18:31.91]That's not cool.
[18:32.75]I wanted to do that.
[18:37.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:39.90]Come here, you.
[18:42.98]Why did I just... Why did I do that?
[18:46.84]Like, seriously, I... I don't know what the fuck I did that for.
[18:51.89]We don't know how happy we are.
[18:53.65]I remember that.
[18:54.85]Yeah, I can't.
[18:55.41]There's four spies.
[18:56.55]Why would I be one of four spies?
[18:57.93]Go back to Scout.
[18:58.51]I was doing fine on Scout.
[19:00.37]In fact, I was doing good on Scout.
[19:03.94]Good enough, right?
[19:09.00]That guy was friendly, but whatever.
[19:13.28]Let's just get on the cart.
[19:14.16]Let's move it.
[19:16.42]Oh, holy.
[19:16.96]Sorry I'm being quiet.
[19:18.66]I'm actually trying to mod the world, too.
[19:23.25]Holy mackerel, I'm so sorry.
[19:24.85]I am being quiet because I am actually modding the room.
[19:28.53]By the way, wait a minute.
[19:29.83]Hey, is fucking February's done, right?
[19:33.39]One more night?
[19:34.99]One more video fucking February?
[19:41.75]I'm pretty sure about that.
[19:45.21]So what's like the last video for fucking February?
[19:50.00]Who knows?
[19:53.30]How am I dominating that guy?
[20:00.30]I was to wait there I'll let him get it.
[20:04.69]Oh, you stole that from him so bad It's more movies This whole TF2 stream is the last video
[20:29.06]You know, I just realized something.
[20:33.14]This is actually... I was wondering why I was having, like, a decent experience so far playing this game.
[20:41.20]Because, like... Alright, so before, when you would stream TF2, people would come into the game and, like, you know, try to backstab you or try to find you or, like, want to high-five you.
[20:51.00]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[20:53.32]You can't really do that anymore, can you?
[20:55.37]Holy shit, I forgot about that.
[20:59.36]Like, I was wondering, like, if, um... If that was, like, something I was just... My brain was... I'm sorry, dude.
[21:06.38]You're friendly, but, you know what?
[21:07.74]Fucking die!
[21:08.58]I'm gonna get, like... I'm gonna get roasted for what I just did.
[21:14.22]Someone's gonna be really upset about it.
[21:19.54]The new matchmaking and work in play.
[21:24.56]That was a crit, too.
[21:25.28]I'm not happy about that.
[21:30.41]How dare he?
[21:34.28]Shit.
[21:36.68]He's a monster.
[21:38.98]Just a quick question.
[21:39.90]Have you... Do you still remember the game The Neverhood?
[21:44.72]The nation game?
[21:45.60]Oh, yeah.
[21:46.04]It's one of the best games ever made.
[21:47.18]Sure.
[21:48.72]Yeah.
[21:49.60]Neverhood is the... In my top five greatest video games ever made.
[21:54.56]Do you think you'd ever play it again?
[21:58.31]I actually thought about streaming it, but the problem with the Neverhood is... There's a massive bug in the Neverhood.
[22:04.58]Where if you play it on something that's not Windows 95... Or... Oh, don't disappear on me.
[22:11.56]Don't kill me either.
[22:12.36]This will embarrass me on stream.
[22:15.30]Don't embarrass me on stream.
[22:18.07]Is that a turkey leg?
[22:20.61]A ham leg?
[22:22.59]It's a ham.
[22:24.77]Uh...
[22:39.71]He just embarrassed me on stream.
[22:42.03]Who?
[22:43.83]This spy just totally fucking just owned me.
[22:47.41]Just owned me.
[22:48.99]I wasn't watching, sorry.
[22:50.69]No, it's all good.
[22:52.59]People that are watching right now are probably just like, oh, he got embarrassed.
[22:58.27]But no, there's a bug in the game.
[23:00.25]We're halfway through.
[23:00.91]Excuse the scamming.
[23:03.29]What the hell is going on here?
[23:06.42]The game will not continue halfway through.
[23:09.10]Oh, is that so?
[23:12.54]But maybe I feel like just to check it out, like on a nostalgia night or something.
[23:15.26]Something like that.
[23:16.50]I mean, we're doing, we're pretty much doing nostalgia night right now.
[23:19.03]Hmm.
[23:24.43]Um, let's go Pyro.
[23:28.97]Oh, you can like just change characters on a game, so.
[23:31.71]Mm-hmm.
[23:33.43]So the Pyro has this flamethrower that lights people on fire.
[23:37.17]You have a compression blast that pushes people back and reflects projectiles.
[23:42.95]You also have this flare.
[23:45.55]Oh my god, this guy embarrassing me on stream.
[23:52.50]Maybe GOG had a fixed version that seemed like they're... I don't think it's on GOG.
[23:58.70]I looked for that game on GOG not that long ago.
[24:04.79]Have I tried Army Krog?
[24:06.39]I'm in Army Krog in like a secret room.
[24:11.02]I am inside of Army Krog.
[24:13.06]My name is in Army Krog in like one of the rooms.
[24:15.60]Because I gave like a bunch of money to the Kickstarter.
[24:18.54]So yes, I played that whole game on stream.
[24:22.89]I don't think that's a VOD that exists, but... But RubyR.
[24:31.25]Ruby, dude.
[24:32.74]Ruby, did you just get paid?
[24:35.86]Ruby with the 50 bucks.
[24:40.16]Ruby just got paid from his, uh... From his, like, oil company.
[24:44.91]Thank you so much, dude.
[24:45.77]Are you ever gonna finish your Witcher 2 playthrough?
[24:52.34]No.
[24:53.16]No, that's the... Okay, guys, guys, we don't bring up... We don't bring up five, six-year-old videos.
[25:02.53]That suck.
[25:04.55]We don't bring those up.
[25:06.13]We bury those videos and pretend they never existed.
[25:08.73]Why don't you just take them off your channel?
[25:11.37]Because they're, I don't know, they're like pieces of... Sometimes you like to go back and be like, oh, I remember I made that video.
[25:19.18]That Witcher 2.
[25:21.62]Who said that?
[25:22.14]Whoever said that, you get an A+.
[25:23.56]I can tell you right now.
[25:27.44]No, no, I can't.
[25:28.62]I don't remember.
[25:29.22]This is our nostalgia stream.
[25:31.61]The Respawn Army.
[25:32.61]Link, fan of the year, asked that question.
[25:35.23]What's going on, Link?
[25:36.65]You've been around for a long time.
[25:37.69]I guess I should always load up Minecraft, too.
[25:41.65]If this is a nostalgia stream.
[25:42.95]I'm just not getting any luck with this.
[25:49.43]um I'm gonna play engineer perfect they're amazing videos hey hey guys this isn't not this isn't a uh uh q a ask ask him to ask you Jeremy street well it's alright I mean we were kind of just chilling that's true we're just chilling

[26:18.38]Have you seen, like, the legit, like, fucking kingdoms in Minecraft, though?
[26:23.13]Like, some of that shit is elaborate.
[26:25.11]Yeah, I mean... I remember back in the day, people used to...
[26:29.81]People used to really, really do insane, insane shit.
[26:32.59]I remember the Enterprise.
[26:33.37]Yeah, like, somebody did, um, something, like, a play on, um, what's that, what is that TV show called in that book about, you know, a JR token?
[26:44.42]Oh, Harry Potter.
[26:45.02]Game of Thrones.
[26:46.32]Oh, Harry Potter or Game of Thrones?

[26:51.16]Harry Potter's J.K.
[26:51.92]Rowling.
[26:53.00]Wait, what, what, what, oh, no, no, God, Lord of the Rings.
[26:55.30]Lord of the Rings.
[26:57.40]They all have, like, fucking syllable names.
[27:00.03]Tolkien.
[27:00.93]J.R.R.
[27:01.54]Tolkien.
[27:05.52]My VR... My only VR... To answer someone's question in the chat.
[27:09.50]My VR experience has only been Resident Evil.
[27:13.64]And that was really fun.
[27:14.56]And that was really fucking scary.
[27:16.14]It was great.
[27:17.06]That experience was fantastic, Sony.
[27:19.32]You should probably... They should have seen the way that I reacted in VR.
[27:23.08]It was like...
[27:25.16]Yeah, she didn't want to even open a door.
[27:27.28]Like, doors would open, and even when nothing was happening, she'd just be like, no, I'm done.
[27:32.85]It was so scary.
[27:34.55]I wish I wasn't on this map.
[27:35.71]I just don't know it at all.
[27:37.11]That is my only VR experience.
[27:39.93]Yeah, Tolkien was Harry Potter, remember?
[27:44.27]Tolkien, uh... J.K.R.
[27:47.09]Tolkien.
[27:48.47]Uh, Pac-Man loves Halloween.
[27:52.09]Yep, that's an old one.
[27:53.81]But Pac-Man did return in a later video, though.
[27:55.77]That's the thing.
[27:57.31]Like, I'm okay with that video, because he came back.
[28:02.83]I'm getting healed right now, which... That medic just died.
[28:05.23]I just don't even know what the hell I'm doing.
[28:08.03]I'm so lost here.
[28:08.99]Hmm... It's a beautiful shirt.
[28:24.81]Somebody just said that, you know, I really like your spirit.
[28:26.79]I was like, oh, thank you.
[28:29.73]Oh, thank you.
[28:29.99]I have good taste.
[28:30.73]So you guys are going to give me some slack here.
[28:32.87]This is the first time I've played this game in a very long time.
[28:35.37]Come on.
[28:35.92]Give me a little slack.
[28:38.02]New server.
[28:40.12]Yeah, you know what?
[28:40.68]Let's just do that now.
[28:41.52]Let's go back to casual.
[28:46.74]I want to play King of the Hill.
[28:50.43]What's up?
[28:51.79]King of the Hills, one control point in the middle.
[28:54.13]You know, like Nepal in Overwatch.
[29:00.82]Or Lijiang Tower.
[29:02.60]It's like that.
[29:03.14]Just like that.
[29:03.92]Except it put me on Frontier for some reason.
[29:06.04]Otto's Big Adventure?
[29:08.81]Actually, it's Otto's Big Adventure 2, The Great Cookie Mystery.
[29:13.01]Is the video.
[29:17.36]Did I tell you guys a story of how I showed that to somebody and they didn't talk to me ever again?
[29:21.87]I think I did, right?
[29:26.07]Oh god, Ruby.
[29:26.83]She in the cat tower?
[29:28.41]Dude, she loves Kitty City.
[29:35.95]Dude, we built this kiddie city for, uh... Kim's cat is, like, staying over here.
[29:40.72]Uh, her name is Youngsoi.
[29:44.08]And we built this fucking kiddie city.
[29:45.80]This thing is, like, an elaborate, like, two-story apartment complex.
[29:51.46]This thing is amazing.
[29:53.54]Oh, she's up there.
[29:54.08]That's cool.
[29:54.52]Uh, Captain Narwhal, uh... Today is my, uh, actual name, so... That's... My mother gave it to me.
[30:02.83]Thank you.
[30:05.99]I got cool stuff.
[30:07.09]Are you?
[30:10.37]Is it really?
[30:14.61]What is going on right now here, guys?
[30:17.00]What is this?
[30:19.24]That's new and that's cool.
[30:20.50]That's really cool.
[30:22.65]It's like a little warm-up.
[30:23.46]Alright, uh, first of all, though, Ruby, Ruby Man, you are like, you're up to like fucking three or four hundred dollars tonight.
[30:29.52]Yeah, stop, stop giving it to him.
[30:32.20]Stop giving that to him, he doesn't deserve it.
[30:35.39]Hey, hey, hey, stupid!
[30:39.45]Stupid!
[30:41.65]No, Ruby, that's, you're too kind, man.
[30:43.71]But stop giving it to him, for real.
[30:47.30]Stop giving it to him.
[30:48.80]He doesn't deserve it.
[30:51.12]Give it to me.
[30:52.10]I accept Venmo, PayPal.
[30:55.10]Oh, hey.
[30:56.98]Excuse me.
[30:58.02]Excuse me.
[30:59.90]Jerma's new to TF2.
[31:01.68]It's the Vibe Fund.
[31:02.94]Dude, I... Alright.
[31:04.32]Like, I went fucking off on, like, Sony's VR.
[31:08.14]And you know what?
[31:08.50]Some of that's my fault, but still, like, fuck that cord.
[31:12.70]That cord is the reason why all the problems existed.
[31:17.42]Like, type in... Can somebody do this?
[31:21.24]You do this if you want to.
[31:22.20]Like, type in, like, PSVR short cord fuck.
[31:26.38]And see if, like, there's gotta be somebody making a bunch of swear words about it.
[31:28.72]You know what I mean?
[31:29.91]Like, PSVR short cable.
[31:32.17]There's gotta be at least five to ten swear words in the Amazon review, right?
[31:35.73]It has to be.
[31:36.95]Because what the fuck is that?
[31:40.79]Oh, yeah.
[31:49.41]Come on, man, we gotta win.
[31:52.75]No, I'm like stuck on a rock.
[31:55.29]Nothing has changed, Jeremy.
[31:57.05]You're still getting stuck on rocks in TF2.
[32:04.49]Link might catch SoundCloud.
[32:07.37]Hold on, wait.
[32:09.47]I guess don't search for that because it's like VR and like fuck in the same sentence.
[32:15.87]Oh, no, no, no.
[32:16.67]Don't do that.
[32:18.65]STAB HIM!
[32:19.53]STAB HIM!
[32:21.17]STA- OH MY GOD!
[32:23.21]Guys!
[32:25.17]Did you die again?
[32:28.70]No, somebody else gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[32:31.46]Mittens.
[32:33.02]Mittens 98.98.
[32:34.12]This is like, you're like, you're up to like $300 tonight too.
[32:36.44]And like, I feel so fucking awful.
[32:38.52]Let me talk about this for a second.
[32:39.81]Seriously.
[32:40.81]Seriously.
[32:43.47]Like, I want these streams to be good.
[32:45.15]And I want them to be worth fucking you paying for them like that.
[32:48.83]And, like, when shit like ha- like, an hour ago... Like, that does not make me happy.
[32:54.27]Like, I... I really don't deserve that hundred dollars.
[32:57.57]Cause, like, the stream so far for, like, the last two hours has been fucking terrible.
[33:01.18]Yeah, I know.
[33:01.96]He really doesn't deserve the money.
[33:03.28]You guys should stop.
[33:06.80]I always feel so awful when, like, a stream sucks.
[33:10.92]Or, like, I deter- I, like, think a stream is not going well.
[33:13.56]Or I, like, get irritated at something.
[33:14.80]You know what I mean?
[33:15.86]Yeah, you guys can all give that money to me.
[33:18.02]Like I said, I accept Venmo.
[33:19.34]Don't ever fucking take, don't ever do that shit.
[33:21.74]If you're gonna give money, you know, hey, how about this?
[33:24.21]Go to your local shelter.
[33:26.35]And, you know, give a hundred bucks to your local animal shelter.
[33:31.45]Oh, yeah, and donate to the MSPCA.
[33:34.00]Donate to the... Stream doesn't suck.
[33:37.42]I also accept vouchers for Bed Bath & Beyond.
[33:41.19]We got almost sold on that today, by the way.
[33:43.17]Oh my god, almost, yeah.
[33:45.21]I was almost like, Jeremy?
[33:47.11]Jeremy?
[33:48.57]Take our money.
[33:52.39]Oh, come on.
[33:52.86]Give me like three here.
[33:53.64]Come on.
[33:54.92]Let me prove why I downloaded this game in the first place back in 2004.
[33:57.66]Really?
[33:57.88]Not 2006.
[33:58.06]Oh.
[33:58.16]Really?
[33:58.70]Oh, yeah.
[34:08.30]I was a little baby back then.
[34:11.10]We all were little babies back then.
[34:14.19]Hold on, sorry.
[34:15.65]Let me like... Mittens, thanks a lot, man.
[34:19.29]That's too kind.
[34:20.69]And also, somebody else.
[34:23.37]Diabetles gave 10 bucks too.
[34:25.01]Hey, here's money.
[34:26.88]What did you say?
[34:27.62]Oh my god!
[34:29.02]Oh my god!
[34:37.13]Mink.
[34:37.89]Mink.
[34:38.53]Mink fur.
[34:39.75]Mink fur.
[34:40.23]I can't give you money any other way.
[34:41.77]I'm digitally inept.
[34:44.15]Oh, is that for me?
[34:45.23]Well, thank you.
[34:46.59]That was $100 from Mink fur.
[34:49.17]For me, right?
[34:50.27]Obviously.
[34:50.85]He didn't specify that in his message.
[34:52.39]No, no, no.
[34:52.59]That was for me.
[34:55.67]That's for me.
[34:57.09]I'm still waiting for you to pay me for the clown stream.
[35:01.11]Hey, what?
[35:02.73]What?
[35:03.84]What?
[35:05.29]Watch out, there's a spy!
[35:09.75]Hypo says I deserve it.
[35:11.19]See, he even capitalized the Y-O-U.
[35:13.45]What?
[35:16.59]I'm gonna buy a car.
[35:17.41]No, but, like, honest to God, make, like, a hundred bucks, like... I need to, like, do something funny.
[35:23.19]Let's do something funny.
[35:25.27]Okay, how about this?
[35:26.51]No.
[35:26.89]No, you know, I, you know, let's just hold, let's just chill.
[35:40.16]Clown car fund.
[35:42.70]No, no clown car.
[35:43.80]You know what?
[35:44.66]That is a clown car fund.
[35:45.78]Because I'm going to use that money to buy a clown car.
[35:51.46]I forgot how fun this game was.
[35:52.78]Even though I'm doing awful.
[35:53.74]I'm not even watching you play anymore.
[35:58.42]I just landed on that guy's head.
[36:02.20]I dropped it right on his skull.
[36:05.50]Skull and Golem says that he loves you.
[36:08.52]Skull and Dolan, thank you.
[36:10.08]That's another $100.
[36:13.94]Guys, I'm gonna, like, you... Don't say things like that.
[36:25.11]This is people's hard-earned money we're talking about.
[36:26.95]Like, honest to God, guys, like, I don't know what to say.
[36:30.05]I don't know what to say when this happens.
[36:33.51]What am I supposed to say?
[36:35.59]Besides, like, this is your hard-earned fucking money.
[36:40.54]If you think I deserve this money, you guys are fucking... You guys spoil the fuck out of me.
[36:48.66]And every time I have a situation like this, I get stuck.
[36:52.06]Because I don't know what to say.
[36:54.35]But... When did I get lit on fire?
[36:57.35]Probably some point in this stream.
[37:01.13]No, guys.
[37:04.19]I need a drink.
[37:05.31]I need a drink right now.
[37:06.95]Because this is getting fucking insane.
[37:12.20]Hold on a minute.
[37:13.80]TF2 can sit in the back burner for a second.
[37:15.38]First of all, Skull and thank you for the 100.
[37:18.66]I love you.
[37:19.10]Never forget that.
[37:19.91]Well, I love you too, dude.
[37:22.53]Have you been here for, like, the last seven fucking almost years?
[37:26.04]Not necessarily on Twitch, but just in general.
[37:29.28]Like, thank you.
[37:30.14]That fucking means a lot.
[37:30.92]Renegade the 5,000 bits.
[37:32.80]Here, give these bits to Otto.
[37:33.90]Alright, we're gonna buy Otto the best food you could possibly buy.
[37:36.78]We do buy him the best food.
[37:38.09]Well, we're gonna go another step further.
[37:40.19]We're gonna get him, like... We're gonna have, like, Gordon Ramsay come over.
[37:43.03]Oh my god, we can add to...
[37:44.47]Kitty City!
[37:45.45]We're gonna add to Kitty City, and we're gonna get Gordon Ramsay to come over and make a dog steak.
[37:49.44]Because that's, like, what's gonna happen, apparently.
[37:52.36]Uh... It's a Renegade Coast.
[37:54.64]Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars, man.
[37:57.46]Frisky Moose.
[37:58.32]100 fucking bucks from Frisky Moose.
[38:00.82]You had a rather atrocious weekend, and this is bringing back some awesome memories.
[38:04.23]Thanks for being awesome.
[38:04.97]Well, Frisky, thank you.
[38:06.99]You never have to feel obligated to give me money.
[38:08.63]Just hang out and fucking enjoy the stream.
[38:10.41]That's all I want.
[38:11.01]That's all I care about.
[38:12.27]So, but thank you.
[38:13.19]That's incredibly generous of you.
[38:15.57]And there was another one, too.
[38:17.25]Like, did I miss one back here?
[38:19.65]No, that was Scullin.
[38:20.35]Alright, like.
[38:22.76]All I care about is if you guys are having a good time.
[38:26.12]Which is why I get angry sometimes when things don't go my way on stream.
[38:30.08]Like PlayStation fucking VR chords too short.
[38:33.44]I'm gonna say that a hundred fucking times.
[38:37.31]And Elac with the five dollars.
[38:38.37]Thank you, dude.
[38:40.01]Jeremiah, I think I speak for all of us when I say we love you.
[38:42.05]You have done something.
[38:42.83]You brought happiness and joy.
[38:44.07]Well, thank you so much, dude.
[38:46.69]That's all I care about.
[38:47.57]What were you gonna say?
[38:49.57]Sorry.
[38:51.03]I think I hear Youngsoi.
[38:52.81]Is she upstairs somewhere?
[38:55.21]Is it loud?
[38:55.83]It's a loud stream?
[38:57.17]Am I loud right now?
[38:59.17]It shouldn't be.
[39:02.03]Yeah, no.
[39:02.39]Youngsoi is playing in Kitty City.
[39:03.67]She lives up there.
[39:06.69]That place is... I mean, I would like to live there.
[39:08.75]Did you see that shot?
[39:10.19]That was pretty good.
[39:11.45]Oh my god.
[39:12.23]I'm totally going to go on Amazon right now.
[39:16.74]Are you already going to add to Kitty City?
[39:18.45]Oh my god, it's going to be Kitty Metropolis.
[39:20.55]Dude, that room is going to be just a cat room.
[39:22.57]Well, it's Otto and Young Soy's room right now.
[39:27.53]The PSVR cord is three meters long.
[39:30.79]Not long enough.
[39:32.55]And when I have to stand up like 30 feet away from my screen, it's not long enough.
[39:41.96]Um... Kitty City expansion.
[39:44.32]What?
[39:47.84]I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
[39:48.90]I was just dumping my remaining bits.
[39:50.98]Well, Ruby, the fact that you would even want to do that is an incredibly humbling thing.
[39:57.06]The fact that you, like, even would consider doing that is... is just mind-boggling to me.
[40:06.83]Like, I've never been able to get used to that.
[40:10.25]Ever.
[40:12.31]And I've never been able to rocket jump either, as you guys have been able to very plainly see.
[40:17.20]That's the extent of my rocket jumping skills.
[40:22.60]Do I play TF2 when I'm not streaming?
[40:23.92]No.
[40:24.74]This is the first time I've loaded this game up in... Like a year?
[40:29.27]At least six months?
[40:30.37]Something like that.
[40:33.45]Something like that.
[40:35.67]I don't know exactly, but it's been a very long time.
[40:38.59]Welcome to the pit.
[40:46.49]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[40:48.37]Bring back Gift of Flight, they say.
[40:50.45]First of all, thank you, dude.
[40:52.27]Dude or dudette, whoever you are.
[40:54.79]Gift of Flight will never be returned because the source video is gone and I accidentally deleted it because I'm a fucking idiot.
[41:02.55]I'm going to get on the cart.
[41:04.87]But I think there's a snippet of it somewhere.
[41:07.83]Somebody ripped a small piece of it.
[41:15.59]Oh, come on.
[41:15.95]That wasn't a direct... Too many scouts.
[41:17.97]Uh, let's go scout.
[41:18.89]I want to deal with some of these scouts.
[41:21.43]But yeah, Pit, well, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[41:24.15]It's fucking insane.
[41:26.11]Thank you.
[41:27.33]Sam!
[41:28.57]Sam gave $5.
[41:29.73]You're too hard on yourself.
[41:30.73]You might think you don't deserve the bits, but we all certainly do.
[41:35.14]And I...
[41:37.69]Look, all I can do, all I can do is try to do the best I can.
[41:43.25]That's all I can do.
[41:44.33]That's all I've ever tried to do.
[41:45.55]That's all I've ever wanted to do.
[41:47.89]Streaming, videos, it's all I've ever wanted to do.
[41:50.67]That's all I ever tried to do.
[41:52.01]Nothing else.
[41:54.13]That's it.
[41:55.17]Aw, Sam, I'll send you a picture of Kitty City later.
[42:00.35]Oh, don't die.
[42:04.48]Oh, boy.
[42:05.86]What?
[42:06.80]There we go.
[42:10.48]I'll be able to buy three Vives.
[42:15.80]One more shot.
[42:16.50]No, don't get stuck.
[42:17.24]I get stuck on the wall.
[42:20.42]Do your best, do your best.
[42:21.34]And, like, yeah, sometimes... I do.
[42:25.70]I do get a little, like, hard on myself.
[42:28.65]And that's because... I want shit to be good.
[42:32.27]I want you... Ow!
[42:33.01]Ow!
[42:33.07]Ow!
[42:39.23]What'd you do?
[42:39.55]I dropped my phone again.
[42:41.17]Oh god, it's broken.
[42:43.83]Jerm is the new Clockwork.
[42:45.09]How is Clockwork doing?
[42:46.65]How are all these guys doing?
[42:47.69]How is, like, Clockwork?
[42:48.59]How is, like, guys like Banny and... How's the whole crew of people doing in the TF2 world?
[42:56.97]I think Clockwork's on an Overwatch team, isn't he?
[42:59.74]From what I remember.
[43:03.89]I know some of them transitioned to be streamers, and some of them are doing really well.
[43:07.92]Seagull's doing really fucking well.
[43:10.82]Playing Overwatch.
[43:11.52]One more, one more, one more.
[43:18.02]You should.
[43:19.98]Yeah, it's months we'll get to see Kitty City.
[43:24.10]Yeah.
[43:26.20]Boo?
[43:27.66]Is Boo here?
[43:29.86]Where's Boo?
[43:31.97]Boo, like, Boo, if Boo is around, Boo, I want to talk to you again, man.
[43:35.33]Where the fuck have you been?
[43:41.03]Ah, he's a YouTuber streamer.
[43:43.10]Yeah, I know.
[43:43.52]I've heard you talk about that.
[43:45.22]He's a good dude.
[43:46.44]Everybody loves Boo.
[43:49.66]And we are getting more... Heal that guy.
[43:52.04]Heal that guy.
[43:52.42]He needs help.
[43:55.96]Now, when I die here, I would want to...
[44:01.41]Boo is in the call.
[44:03.60]I'm glad this stream... No, it's just a joke from one of the videos from a long time ago.
[44:07.84]Oh.
[44:08.54]From the original Jerma is Mad video.
[44:11.10]That's a nostalgic one.
[44:13.77]Hmm.
[44:13.95]Let's watch it right now.
[44:16.91]No, no, no.
[44:17.33]Don't watch it right now.
[44:18.69]You're going to get copyright flagged.
[44:22.83]By who?
[44:23.23]By you?
[44:25.16]By me.
[44:25.78]Yeah, I'm going to copyright strike your YouTube.
[44:28.90]No.
[44:30.60]Oh, you know what?
[44:31.98]What?
[44:32.79]I was about to say, I should try to edit the vlog while you're streaming, but... Oh, yeah.
[44:38.91]But I'm not going.
[44:40.15]Oh, hey, guys.
[44:40.39]By the way, coming up on second Jerma.
[44:43.59]Not very far away.
[44:45.58]Going to Washington, D.C.
[44:47.68]And it's going to be a meet the president vlog.
[44:49.98]You know what I'm saying?
[44:51.22]Going to meet the president.
[44:55.94]Like, Obama's still in office?
[44:57.72]I don't even know.
[44:59.19]Or is it fucking Donald?
[45:01.76]We'll be vlogging in D.C.
[45:03.99]and... They're going to be in D.C.
[45:07.39]next weekend.
[45:07.69]And we'll be... Not next week.
[45:11.19]We're going to PAX next week.
[45:13.19]That guy just forgot how to be alive.
[45:15.29]We're going to Washington, D.C.
[45:19.03]this week.
[45:19.57]After you stream on Friday.
[45:21.43]That'll be fun.
[45:25.15]We'll be all over the place.
[45:38.95]No, Mac, no.
[45:39.59]You don't have to film this.
[45:41.31]I'm going to just give you this video file.
[45:43.95]So don't worry.
[45:47.07]Anyways, I haven't died yet, so I haven't been able to say thank you to all these fucking incredibly generous people.
[45:51.17]Do you know what?
[45:52.05]I'm just gonna die.
[45:52.55]Just get me.
[45:53.97]He didn't... I... Alright, I'm dead.
[45:57.41]Give me one second.
[45:58.89]Tanshu, thank you for the thousand bits.
[46:01.68]Coffee, Cheetos, chicken.
[46:02.62]Of course.
[46:03.36]It's an everyday diet.
[46:04.88]That's what you should be eating.
[46:06.34]Uh, black mage element, thank you for the thousand bits. Holy shit TF2.
[46:09.00]Yep. We're playing TF2 right now, we're trying to unwind.
[46:13.00]We're trying to unwind from a- a debacle that happened like an hour and a half ago.
[46:17.00]And Rainbow, thank you for the 1500 bits. This is the first time I spent any money on a streamer but it's worth it to see you play TF2 again buddy.
[46:24.00]Rainbow, like alright, if you if you come to the stream and you see me playing TF2 and you want to give me money don't- don't even worry about it. Don't even worry about it. But thank you so much I do appreciate it, thank you.
[46:36.24]We're not planning on doing a meetup in DC, right?
[46:38.60]No.
[46:39.16]No, no, no, no.
[46:40.58]We're meeting the president.
[46:43.76]It's a meet the president vlog.
[46:49.47]You can just watch the video.
[46:50.53]You'll laugh at it.
[46:55.09]It's a meet the president.
[46:59.75]What?
[47:00.17]Oh.
[47:02.59]If you guys know me by now, you know that it's...
[47:05.23]It's going to be a little bit of a joke.
[47:06.89]You know what I mean?
[47:07.31]A little bit of a joke video.
[47:10.84]I'll be doing a meetup at PAX, though, for sure.
[47:14.34]Yeah, I do one every year.
[47:15.46]So, you'll see me at PAX and say hello.
[47:18.56]Yeah, I do it every year.
[47:25.55]Don't do it.
[47:26.49]Don't do it.
[47:26.81]Don't do it.
[47:28.75]Ah.
[47:30.50]Alright, also, thank you so much to KJ.
[47:34.44]Got a new job today.
[47:35.22]Thanks for the 15 bucks, dude.
[47:36.32]Here's me paying it forward.
[47:37.70]Also, please try out Job Sim sometimes, even if it's not on stream.
[47:40.67]I've... I'm gonna play that game.
[47:42.59]I've heard that game is fucking hilarious.
[47:44.77]It's just... Yeah, be a PAX Prime as well.
[47:50.00]But thank you so much, KJ.
[47:52.58]Be at PAX Prime.
[47:53.72]Also, who else?
[47:55.12]Somebody else did.
[47:55.76]Dedo, thank you for the $1,700.
[47:58.12]Got a new job.
[47:59.54]I hope your job's going fucking fantastic.
[48:01.28]Hopefully you have a new job.
[48:02.14]Hopefully you love your new job, dude.
[48:03.36]Seriously.
[48:04.48]I wish you the best.
[48:06.28]Minkfur again with $1,000.
[48:07.48]Next Rumble when?
[48:08.32]I don't know.
[48:11.81]Maybe this year.
[48:12.77]We hope so.
[48:13.29]We hope probably this year.
[48:15.55]The goal is to have three big videos come out over the summer.
[48:20.70]We have two that are already me and the wine guy.
[48:26.64]He's been on stream once before, Ray.
[48:29.24]We have... People know him as the wine guy.
[48:35.78]Actually, no.
[48:36.84]Funnily enough, no.
[48:38.28]It's because he was the wine guy in Turbo Rumble.
[48:42.10]But, yeah, we've been working on something.
[48:44.28]And it's going to be huge.
[48:45.10]It's going to be big.
[48:46.72]Go big or go home at this point, right?
[48:49.09]Yeah, I'm excited for when you start filming that.
[48:51.51]It's gonna be pretty good.
[48:52.99]I hope so.
[48:53.85]That's the theory.
[48:54.47]And let me just, like, clean it up and fucking take the win.
[48:56.59]You know what I'm saying?
[48:58.23]Why not just, like, clean it up and take the win and fall off accidentally?
[49:00.43]It's okay.
[49:04.93]This Vineyard Foe movie?
[49:05.87]No.
[49:06.71]It's gonna be something different.
[49:09.61]I think it's gonna be... I think it's gonna be pretty interesting, though.
[49:13.84]I hope so.
[49:14.84]Because it's gonna cost money, but you know.
[49:19.35]My ears?
[49:21.71]Me?
[49:23.29]Maybe, yeah.
[49:24.07]Maybe a little.
[49:25.13]Maybe a little bit.
[49:30.32]Come on, somebody... Renegade, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[49:33.68]Jerma, you give me so many laughs over the years.
[49:35.26]You're worth every damn bit.
[49:36.34]Donated to you.
[49:37.00]Also, if you could do one more modded GTA 4 stream with Ster, my life would be complete.
[49:41.51]Well, Renegade, like...
[49:45.43]I just got to level two renegade is that good oh so here look see look at this that's how many hours I have on each character and yes those are ours and that's not even counting um like before they even did that dude you have no fucking mind whoa whoa easy easy easy this is like over like seven years that's like over eight years okay fine
[50:12.73]God, you're getting, like, roasted.
[50:14.17]Holy shit.
[50:15.33]Just because you love a game.
[50:19.91]I want to play Engineer on defense.
[50:22.80]Badly.
[50:25.00]It's been a long time.
[50:27.46]Oh, God.
[50:27.92]Like, oh, you just opened up the floodgates here.
[50:34.09]And he still sucks.
[50:36.53]No, come on, man.
[50:38.17]It's like, I...
[50:42.28]Come on, guys.
[50:45.02]Thank you so much for the $5.
[50:46.72]Tossing out your last bit.
[50:47.72]Sleep tight, Jerma Kim Kappa.
[50:50.91]Mink.
[50:52.45]I hope you have a wonderful day.
[50:53.77]If you're taking off.
[50:56.17]Like, seriously.
[50:57.51]Don't worry about us.
[50:59.75]You take care of yourself.
[51:04.55]Hopefully you have a fucking fantastic day.
[51:06.12]Hopefully you all do.
[51:08.26]Also, Gerfield.
[51:10.16]Gerfield.
[51:12.23]Gave 10 bucks.
[51:12.93]I met you at PAX three years ago and me and my friends had been huge fans even beforehand.
[51:17.33]You're really tall in real life.
[51:19.70]And Star Wars stood against the wall while you talked to all your fans.
[51:22.82]I love you.
[51:23.34]Here's my proof.
[51:24.04]I've kept it for years.
[51:26.66]Let me see this.
[51:28.30]Holy shit, dude.
[51:32.72]That's fucking amazing.
[51:34.44]Are you serious, man?
[51:35.40]That's fucking amazing.
[51:36.34]Thank you.
[51:37.88]That's incredibly touching to hear.
[51:40.59]That is like touching me in the heart right now.
[51:43.63]Like, honest to God, Gurfield.
[51:45.81]Aw, that is so sweet.
[51:47.53]Thanks a lot, man.
[51:49.55]If somebody wants to give him permission to link, then he can.
[51:53.31]It's Gurfield.
[51:55.48]Aw, that is so sweet.
[51:56.50]And then HotPizzaWithBacon gave 15.
[51:57.98]Your signature is trash.
[52:02.78]That was like 15.
[52:03.38]Oh, here, I can do this.
[52:06.26]I can just do it here.
[52:08.46]There you go.
[52:09.90]I was like 16.
[52:12.40]First time ever giving my hot... I was like 15.
[52:15.28]Hot pizza with bacon gave $15.
[52:17.16]First time ever giving money.
[52:18.10]Had a terrible past couple years, but everything is seeming better now.
[52:20.90]Thanks for making me laugh all these years and helping me through it.
[52:23.20]Love you, buddy.
[52:24.58]Well, hot pizza with bacon, first of all, you are delicious.
[52:29.14]Like, absolutely scrumptious.
[52:31.54]And second of all, look, I'm just a guy.
[52:35.74]I'm just a guy, and all I know is...
[52:39.50]As long as you're happy, then I'm happy.
[52:41.56]And hopefully your life is getting better.
[52:44.03]I really hope that.
[52:45.57]Now thanks for the 1500.
[52:47.91]Also, welcome to the pit cave.
[52:48.95]2000 says, thy diarrhea every day.
[52:51.87]Well, I remember that life.
[52:53.13]It's not a good life.
[52:54.37]And I'm just being a piece of crap right now.
[52:56.68]And we won.
[52:58.06]I didn't do a damn thing.
[52:58.92]I didn't do a goddamn thing.
[53:04.78]Two badges and one day mittens.
[53:07.97]This nostalgia trip is too much.
[53:09.87]Mittens again with $50.
[53:12.93]I hope you own like a franchise.
[53:18.88]I really hope you own a franchise, man.
[53:23.96]I hope you own like a Quiznos.
[53:26.42]Are you like the Quiznos heir to the throne?
[53:28.42]I hope so.
[53:30.98]But thanks a lot.
[53:32.56]It means a lot.
[53:34.54]Open some crates for good old times.
[53:38.37]I want to see if I have any keys.
[53:39.91]I don't think I even have any keys.
[53:43.07]You used to draw Jerma fan art?
[53:44.97]Did you really?
[53:45.47]This is not a good place for this.
[53:48.07]What am I doing?
[53:48.57]This is not a place that I want to put this thing.
[54:04.18]Is he tired?
[54:06.32]He's being so cute.
[54:09.94]Oh my god.
[54:10.40]Yeah, the thousand dollar badge is just like, holy fuck, man.
[54:13.88]I never thought I would ever... When bits got introduced, I never expected that anyone on my channel would have like the thousand dollar badge.
[54:24.82]So it's like just... It's... No words can even describe how I feel about that.
[54:30.65]And come on, let me get one more.
[54:31.75]Okay.
[54:35.66]Am I going to go to Tip of the Hats this year?
[54:37.34]Absolutely.
[54:39.20]If they're doing it again, I will definitely 100% I will be there.
[54:43.36]100%.
[54:43.96]I'm not sure if they're going to do the same venue or what their plans are, but yes.
[54:53.01]I would not miss that.
[54:55.95]No way.
[54:57.05]Especially because of how much fun it was in person this past year.
[54:59.29]So, yes.
[55:02.65]Where's there...
[55:08.75]Ruby is a whale?
[55:10.69]Wait, like one of those, like, iPad game whales?
[55:13.29]Alright, I need to get this.
[55:18.32]I forget the spots.
[55:19.40]Where's the sentry spots in here?
[55:20.66]Right here, right?
[55:22.00]Aiming down.
[55:23.04]I believe so.
[55:24.32]God, it's been so long.
[55:31.52]Got ya.
[55:32.92]Alright.
[55:33.78]Good enough.
[55:35.84]God, I forgot... I forgot Engineer was this fun.
[55:40.54]When's a book coming out?
[55:41.38]Uh, you know, I'm gonna... I'm gonna make a final nail in the coffin on this book.
[55:46.42]I'm just gonna release what I have in the next, like, month or two.
[55:50.96]And you'll just see how much of a piece of shit this book is.
[55:55.27]So, we'll put a throne... We'll put a throne, a nail in this... Why does he say throne?
[56:01.41]Why the fuck did I say throne for?
[56:02.65]Probably because we were listening to the song earlier.
[56:06.61]Oh, what's going on, Nate?
[56:08.29]This is Chili of Destiny.
[56:10.81]For those of you guys who don't know, Chili of Destiny, or Nate, is the voice actor for the Scout in this game.
[56:21.07]He is the Team Fortress 2 Scout.
[56:22.99]Very talented man, extremely comedic person.
[56:27.18]Gave the Scout an incredible life.
[56:30.56]I would highly suggest you follow Chili of Destiny.
[56:33.52]He's a very, very, very, very fun dude.
[56:38.12]but please do that.
[56:39.14]Oh, Jeremy.
[56:40.20]Yeah?
[56:41.74]Man, I have so many feels for you, dude, but I don't have millions of bits to show it.
[56:46.52]I remember going through all your videos over the years.
[56:49.11]Wait, what?
[56:50.91]Over and over again.
[56:51.77]You have charisma that I have never seen replicated in other team being in my life.
[56:56.81]Just know that I will always be with you, man.
[56:58.85]Not to sound weird or anything, but...
[57:01.14]Yeah, like... Haddington Hattie?
[57:03.64]Haddington.
[57:04.50]Yeah, it's a Haddington.
[57:05.52]Dude, like... You weren't going to see that, so... I know, but you don't have to... I've said this.
[57:13.05]I might sound like a broken record at this point.
[57:14.55]I really might.
[57:16.03]But... If you can't afford to give this stream or my channel money, don't... I don't care.
[57:22.20]Don't worry about it.
[57:25.52]The fact that there's 2,700 people here right now watching this is enough to make me incredibly happy.
[57:31.44]And, like, you don't have to feel like, oh, fuck, I didn't give Jerma, like, $500.
[57:38.67]Oh, God, he must fucking know.
[57:42.01]What am I going to do?
[57:42.73]No, like, you're all fucking awesome.
[57:45.72]All of you.
[57:47.91]If you can't like financially do like don't even think about that that should never be on your mind ever Like it doesn't bother me like I don't care that that's not something that I care about Here's what I care about ready.
[58:02.25]Here's the box that I want to check and this is it.
[58:04.67]This is the only fucking box Are you having a good time?
[58:11.15]Did you say no because if you did then I'm doing something wrong, and I need to do better
[58:18.05]Ow.
[58:20.89]Goddamn right I'm awesome.
[58:26.04]Jerma hates me because I'm a broke college student.
[58:28.08]No.
[58:28.94]Not true.
[58:31.28]But, with that being said, Angry Toe just gave $5.
[58:33.54]I've been copying your vocal mannerisms for years now and I want to give you the biggest thank you I can.
[58:38.58]Love you.
[58:38.88]Well...
[58:40.50]If I can give you something to, like, have fun with, then go for it, man.
[58:44.03]I hope you have fun.
[58:45.53]I hope, like, you can take my fucking fucked up voice and do something fun with it.
[58:50.63]You know?
[58:53.29]But thank you, Angry.
[58:53.93]It means a lot.
[58:57.29]And then, Croucher, I want to hear you play pretentious dickweed during your next bitstream.
[59:03.93]Pretentious dick... I want to hear you be a pretentious dick.
[59:09.02]And Croacher, yeah.
[59:09.96]Thanks, Croacher.
[59:11.42]And then... Of course... Of course... The man... I've seen him before.
[59:19.14]Shadow Bolts.
[59:20.12]Comes in and drops $100.
[59:22.04]Streamer sucks!
[59:23.48]But again, much love.
[59:25.48]Hey, Shadow Bolts, I don't know if you were here earlier, dude.
[59:29.50]Were you here, like, an hour ago, Shadow?
[59:31.70]Because, like, you might not have given me that $100 because it was a train wreck.
[59:38.30]Is this a real talk stream?
[59:40.64]No, I mean, not necessarily.
[59:43.64]This is a hangout and just chill.
[59:46.14]Haven't done this in a while, you know?
[59:48.46]Just hang out, not really do any, like, bits or jokes or anything.
[59:51.30]Just kind of chill and just talk to you guys about whatever, you know?
[59:55.00]I'm going to screenshot a lot of these messages so you can read them later.
[59:57.78]Because I know that you can't see them sometimes.
[60:00.06]Yeah, definitely.
[60:00.54]Please do.
[60:00.98]Because I would love to read them all.
[60:02.98]Sometimes I sit here and look at my, like, Twitch alerts after a stream and just read the ones I didn't see.
[60:08.70]What happened an hour ago, he won't tell me.
[60:11.44]Well, let's just say... Well, first of all... It was a shit show.
[60:14.21]Well, first of all, let me just... Let me just do a little bit of work here, guys.
[60:16.77]You want to see, like, 2000... Like, 2012 Jerma?
[60:18.55]Remember this shit?
[60:22.59]Let me know if I, like, if I can ring a bell here.
[60:24.61]I'm dead.
[60:26.60]Is that ringing a bell?
[60:38.22]Build a teleporter.
[60:39.54]I'm going to leave the game.
[60:40.38]And redo it.
[60:44.46]Oh, that's so sweet.
[60:45.36]I'm screenshotting this for later.
[60:49.39]Please?
[60:50.05]What did I say?
[60:50.67]Please, sir, vacuum my rectum.
[60:54.55]Is that what I said?
[60:56.35]Please, sir, vacuum my rectum?
[60:58.01]Yeah, you said something about that.
[61:00.43]Oh, God.
[61:02.21]Holy mackerel.

[61:11.48]She's super cute she's like a very cute cat She's just like her mom she can be a real You want to say Bitch
[61:36.75]I didn't say it.
[61:37.59]I didn't say it, guys.
[61:38.35]It wasn't me.
[61:39.49]Youngsoi is just like her mom.
[61:43.49]Suck a fart out of my ass.
[61:44.71]What do I have to do?
[61:46.13]Click one?
[61:53.70]But she is a bangle orange tabby.
[61:58.46]She's, like, so cute.
[62:00.10]She's eight pounds, too.
[62:01.14]She's a tiny cat.
[62:03.14]Yeah, she is tiny.
[62:09.01]Banned?
[62:09.39]Why would I get banned for what?
[62:12.41]You never told us what happened a year ago?
[62:13.41]What happened a year ago?
[62:14.35]Somebody refresh me.
[62:18.97]What did I do a year ago?
[62:20.87]I lost track, sorry.
[62:22.09]Whatever I was talking about.
[62:25.93]This is a jock shock stream now.
[62:28.45]This is a... This is a try to get kills as engineer stream.
[62:35.81]He doesn't try to do anything as Engineer.
[62:37.05]Because Engineer is my favorite.
[62:38.71]Oh boy.
[62:39.83]That guy just died.
[62:41.57]I'm okay with this.
[62:46.27]Okay, well that... There he was.
[62:47.97]You got to see him.
[62:53.70]And now I'm going to die from this.
[62:55.02]No!
[62:57.14]Whatever.
[63:00.86]If someone has never watched Jermba before, they just saw a man tell his girlfriend to suck a fart out of his ass.
[63:08.66]I didn't say that to her.
[63:11.99]Fucking February was the best.
[63:13.19]I was really depressed and it made my days a little brighter.
[63:16.87]Well, you can thank Holy Mac for that.
[63:20.45]Because he was the one that was in charge of it.
[63:23.28]Can we all get a big thank you?
[63:24.66]You know, it's a thankless job, Holy Mac.
[63:27.26]Let's go ahead and do a big thank you.
[63:29.82]Everybody right now say, Holy Mac, or Kalem, thank you for all your fucking hard work.
[63:35.11]Holy Mac, thank you for all of your hard work.
[63:39.35]He's doing a fucking fantastic job.
[63:43.08]Couldn't be happier.
[63:44.12]Oh my god, these messages are so sweet.
[63:53.22]Yeah, you guys are... You guys are really nice.
[63:56.24]And watch this.
[63:56.94]We're talking about nice.
[63:59.08]Boink.
[63:59.74]Bink.
[64:00.78]And... Boink.
[64:02.10]No.
[64:02.58]It's okay.
[64:04.53]I really need this here, though.
[64:09.87]No, don't do it.
[64:10.89]Come on, man.
[64:11.53]Let me just get this up.
[64:16.45]Thanks, McDonald Nuggets.
[64:19.00]Oh, my God.
[64:19.64]Thank you.
[64:20.70]McDonald's Nuggets.
[64:21.56]Mm-hmm.
[64:23.03]I have to... Okay, Mr. Sneakman made me say his name.
[64:26.13]Mr. Sneak... I'll say Mr. Sneakman's name whenever.
[64:28.33]Because he's a fucking hero.
[64:34.23]Oh, come on.
[64:37.81]Come on!
[64:38.31]How much health does he have?
[64:41.08]Give me a break.
[64:42.30]Do you know what?
[64:46.48]I do know that.
[64:47.28]Thank you.
[64:49.26]I'm a lucky girl.
[64:54.33]Mr. Sneakman is the best.
[64:55.37]I need a real, like... The next GermaRumble Live, Mr. Sneakman will be a participant.
[65:00.44]How do we find a pregnant man?
[65:04.36]Anybody know where we can find a, like, pregnant man?
[65:11.41]You thought he edited... I really thought Jerma edited some of those videos because how well they were edited and how they were close to the old content.
[65:18.04]Well, that's why he's fucking got the skills.
[65:22.40]That's why, you know, he's making those videos, you know?
[65:28.25]I watched a handful and I'm like, you know what?
[65:30.21]Damn, this guy.
[65:30.91]This guy knows what he's doing.
[65:32.77]You know what I'm saying?
[65:36.88]Shit.
[65:37.10]I just wasted three crits.
[65:40.48]That's not good.
[65:42.67]Not good.
[65:45.07]Godly Wizard for $10.
[65:46.25]You're an amazing dude, Jerma.
[65:47.29]I've been watching your content for years and I wish you the best.
[65:50.47]Thank you, Godly.
[65:51.43]And, like... It's really weird to read, like, out loud some of these things.
[65:58.17]I always, like, feel like... This might sound, like, odd.
[66:02.15]Maybe it doesn't, but... Like, me reading a sentence saying, you're an amazing dude, Jerma.
[66:07.43]I wish you the best.
[66:08.19]Like, yeah, you're so great.
[66:09.91]I always feel so odd
[66:14.14]You know?
[66:15.38]Like, that, like, somebody actually, somebody thinks that of me.
[66:19.01]Like, some of you guys have said that.
[66:22.63]And it's like, it's so hard to react to that.
[66:26.59]Just because it's hard to put into words how I feel about... You guys, like, you guys are so fucking, such a huge part of my life, you know?
[66:37.17]Thanks, Holy Mac, for the link.
[66:40.74]I saw it.
[66:41.32]Making all the messages up.
[66:42.92]It's weird to read somebody that really likes you.
[66:46.20]When, you know, I just kind of feel like I'm just a dude that likes to make dumb jokes, you know?
[66:51.88]And that's it.
[66:54.24]But I do appreciate the kind words, I really do.
[66:56.17]Like, I wish there was another way for me to say thank you.
[66:59.91]Like, all I can say is thanks.
[67:01.23]Really.
[67:01.45]Uh, you're welcome, Walmu.
[67:05.17]Or 52, however you pronounce that.
[67:08.23]Booker that shit.
[67:09.97]Oh, don't worry.
[67:10.35]I butcher names all the time.
[67:11.99]I don't think I've ever said anybody's name correctly.
[67:15.89]Oh, my God.
[67:17.15]You're gonna, like, have to go through my phone to, like, read all of these messages.
[67:20.84]Am I gonna cry?
[67:22.22]I probably will.
[67:23.14]What?
[67:25.48]Oh, Spencer!
[67:26.12]I just saw Spencer's name pop up.
[67:28.00]Oh, my God, Spencer, where were you, like, when we needed you earlier?
[67:30.96]Oh, Spencer, I needed you to, like, ban my account, like, an hour ago.
[67:35.84]I needed you to, like... No, you know what you needed to do, like, an hour ago?
[67:37.95]You needed to, like...
[67:40.17]You need to, like, go in, like, the Twitch files and make me look better.
[67:44.97]Like, is there, like, a way to, like, have you go in the Twitch files?
[67:47.47]What did he say?
[67:50.79]What did he say?
[67:51.27]Let's see.
[67:52.39]Can't believe it's only been three months.
[67:53.49]Your stream is amazing.
[67:54.25]I can't say enough.
[67:54.83]Well, Spencer, thanks, man.
[67:58.35]I don't know if you're... Are you in the... Do you work in the office in San Francisco?
[68:02.85]Or are you just a global?
[68:05.43]Because...
[68:07.42]I might be, you know, dumped that way at some point.
[68:10.08]Mr. Sneakman just killed me again.
[68:13.21]Edit the... BRB grabbing time machine to ban you.
[68:18.95]Yeah, just go in, like, the Twitch files and make me, like, not look like such a dickhead.
[68:21.95]You know what I mean?
[68:24.65]Actually, yeah, I'm not sure that's why I'm just curious of you.
[68:30.08]Hack the Matrix to make me taller.
[68:32.62]Dude, I'm fucking 5'40".
[68:36.70]Need a dispenser.
[68:37.40]No, I work from home in New York, but whisper me I'll be in San Francisco when you're there.
[68:40.37]Oh, alright.
[68:41.31]Hell yeah, dude.
[68:42.43]Yeah, I'll hit you.
[68:43.43]Definitely hit you.
[68:44.33]Dispense, man.
[68:44.87]5-4 that.
[68:46.21]Oh god, hold on.
[68:46.95]Did I miss one?
[68:49.93]I think I missed something else.
[69:06.91]Uh... IKH1, thank you.
[69:09.73]This $15 is all the money I had for food for the next month.
[69:13.34]Thanks for making me give you $15, Jerma.
[69:15.90]I hope you're happy.
[69:17.48]Really, though, I hope you're happy.
[69:18.38]You're a cool guy.
[69:19.90]Well, how about this?
[69:20.50]How about if I, like, eat food?
[69:22.34]I'll take that $15 you just gave me, and I will eat food.
[69:25.05]I'll make sure I buy, like, a burrito.
[69:27.19]And I'll, like, take a picture of me eating the food.
[69:31.07]I'll take a picture of me eating a burrito.
[69:32.63]And be like, oh, that was a good $15 burrito.
[69:35.77]It'll be like $8, maybe.
[69:38.44]This guy's gonna kill himself.
[69:42.02]Ah, no.
[69:44.64]Oh, well.
[69:47.30]Are they sub- Yeah, I'll address this again.
[69:54.84]Sub-messages are something I need to find a solution for.
[69:59.09]I think I know what I might be doing.
[70:03.01]I think so.
[70:03.43]I'm not sure.
[70:06.38]Ah, Mr. Sneakman, you just made me go pyro.
[70:10.90]$15 burrito or no deal.
[70:12.08]Alright, I'll eat a $15 burrito.
[70:16.91]Hey, you know how to make a $15 burrito?
[70:19.47]You, like... Add everything.
[70:20.97]You make a put in, like, a bunch of, like, avocado.
[70:22.81]And, like, say you... Say you want... No, get extra cheese, like, 30 times.
[70:27.00]So, it'll be, like, an extra, like, 9 bucks.
[70:31.36]Alright.
[70:31.84]Mr. Sneak Man made me go spy, so... I mean, pyro.
[70:35.74]Spencer, are you gonna watch me get my elbow tattooed or not?
[70:40.06]Or not?
[70:40.78]I mean...
[70:43.25]What if he's not into watching people get hurt?
[70:45.82]What if he's like, I don't like that.
[70:46.84]Alright, I got the crit fire, so that means I'm a better pyro, right?
[70:54.24]Ooh, got him.
[70:58.22]Oh, hey, it's sub time!
[71:00.02]Yeah, thanks for the subs.
[71:02.08]What are our jobs?
[71:03.50]Jeremy does this full time.
[71:05.80]Yeah, I'd like to say I do this full time, right?
[71:10.83]Didn't even watch my own wife get a tattoo.
[71:12.57]It's too gnarly for me.
[71:13.99]Oh, wow.
[71:14.63]Baby.
[71:17.58]So many people are gonna give me full-time shit.
[71:19.80]They're gonna be like, full-time!
[71:20.96]Oh, yeah, for real?
[71:21.86]Can barely stream PSVR for an hour before having, like, a fucking mental breakdown.
[71:27.69]Aw, we're going to, um... We're gonna have to, like, go through these.
[71:35.43]Yeah, I will, for sure.
[71:39.41]Did they change that?
[71:40.39]Did you, like, stay on fire?
[71:41.46]Alright, who has the better pyro?
[71:43.08]Me.
[71:45.18]Shit, this is not good.
[71:50.92]Give me the health, come on.
[71:56.26]What?
[71:56.44]I thought I... what?
[72:00.36]Captain Scrapples.
[72:02.54]Thank you, Captain Scrapples.
[72:03.34]You're honestly a magnet for this community.
[72:04.96]I remember when I first showed the first Jerm Rumble and Jerma is mad to my friends and laughing my ass off along with them.
[72:10.12]The fact that I see you playing the game I so dearly love is amazing after all this time.
[72:13.96]If you ever need a comp team, you always got a spot in my heart.
[72:17.46]Or legit, I need another scout.
[72:19.40]Well, thank you, Captain.
[72:21.36]But I don't think you want me as a scout on your team.
[72:24.55]Because all I'll do is just say a bunch of swears and rage quit after the first match.
[72:30.10]But hey, maybe that's what you're looking for.
[72:32.30]And if so, then you know.
[72:36.08]Come on, let me get this.
[72:37.66]Give me one thing for Christmas.
[72:39.30]That's the only thing I want for Christmas is a reflect kill.
[72:42.34]Nothing else.
[72:43.80]God damn it, Al.
[72:49.94]Can't go to packs?
[72:53.37]Four inches taller.
[72:55.24]Well, swiggity.
[72:56.26]Yeah, I'm an old man, swiggity.
[72:58.76]I'm a dirty old man.
[72:59.88]Oh, wait, what does this mean?
[73:01.28]You are a dirty old man.
[73:02.54]Wait, what does this mean?
[73:04.45]Can anyone say that?
[73:05.95]What's, like, the red and the purple and... What does that mean?
[73:08.63]Oh, wait.
[73:15.69]Please rate the quality of the map.
[73:16.78]Eh, it was beautiful.
[73:19.30]Um, I will watch it one day, probably.
[73:21.98]The Jerma is Mad series, I don't know.
[73:24.40]I mean, they're funny videos, I think so.
[73:26.43]They're, like, back when I, like, pretended I was a good boy.
[73:31.97]Um, so, to answer someone's question, Jeremy and I met at a Christmas party.
[73:37.83]Yeah, we met through, uh, you guys know Burger Boy.
[73:40.79]Burger Boy was the connection between me and Kim.
[73:45.53]So.
[73:46.31]And, uh, he... And we have not stopped seeing each other ever since.
[73:51.11]Yeah.
[73:52.81]Mm-hmm.
[73:53.99]What did Spencer say?
[73:55.34]What the heck is this TF2 leveling?
[73:56.84]I haven't played in two years.
[73:57.82]I'm trying to figure that out myself.
[73:59.04]Websites.
[74:00.50]She does all kinds of computer things.
[74:13.62]I'm going to actually leave the server because I need to pee.
[74:16.41]And we're going to take a break.
[74:17.21]I'll be back in two minutes.
[74:20.73]I'll see you guys in two minutes.
[74:24.10]Okay.
[74:24.46]Be right back.
[78:21.11]Wait, why did somebody just say erectile dysfunction?
[78:23.41]What did I do?
[78:23.81]Remember when this was a quiet stream?
[78:28.53]I mean, it's been a quiet stream.
[78:30.53]Oh, it's because I peed.
[78:31.23]Yeah, I peed really loudly.
[78:33.98]I made sure to... I kept the mic on.
[78:35.32]I made sure to piss directly into the rim as hard as I could.
[78:38.78]So you guys would be like, ow, fuck.
[78:42.44]I'm leaving the door open because Otto's coming in.
[78:45.76]Can you close... The heater makes a lot of noise.
[78:49.71]What's my notification?
[78:54.04]I don't even know what the... Tough Break Cosmetic... Dude, my inventory is such a fucking mess.
[78:59.16]I don't even know.

[79:02.50]Can't even look at it.
[79:03.60]I want more King of the Hill, though, for sure.
[79:13.97]So, right now, me and Kim are drinking... You guys know the Dan Aykroyd vodka?
[79:19.54]That Crystal Skull Vodka, the Dan Aykroyd Vodka.
[79:22.26]It's pretty good.
[79:23.28]It's not bad.
[79:23.98]Yeah, and we're having it with... This is a Japanese drink.
[79:29.06]I don't know how to pronounce it.
[79:31.10]It's like a soda.
[79:32.08]It's the soda that you take the cap off and then you pop the marble into the soda.
[79:37.65]It's really, really interesting.
[79:38.65]It's good stuff.
[79:40.55]Show inventory?
[79:44.35]I don't know.
[79:45.31]I'm not going to show my inventory because I wouldn't show you guys my dirty room, you know?

[80:20.48]But I already do when facecam comes on.
[80:21.88]Yeah, but that's different.
[80:24.18]This is like... There was a clown stream here.
[80:27.26]That's my justification.
[80:28.25]There wasn't a clown stream in my bedroom.
[80:30.63]Holy mack.
[80:31.57]Um... We'll send you a bottle if it's possible.
[80:37.41]Ooh.

[80:40.23]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[80:40.97]That bottle.
[80:42.13]I'm keeping that shit.
[80:43.19]Two scouts.
[80:43.97]Two scouts.
[80:44.39]Come on.
[80:46.31]Come on.
[80:46.61]Let me show them why they called me Jerma.
[80:48.56]The Scout Killer 985.
[80:51.81]There it is.
[80:52.17]How many scouts?
[80:53.57]How many more scouts do I got to kill?
[80:55.43]Oh, what's that?
[80:55.99]Like four?
[80:57.91]Back in the day, guys, everybody called me Jerma the Scout Killer 985.
[81:03.63]People were talking about me, you know?
[81:04.81]People were talking about me.
[81:05.77]You know what I said?
[81:07.23]Keep talking.
[81:07.77]That's what I said.
[81:10.35]Jerma the Scout Killer.
[81:11.39]Watch this one.
[81:15.14]Ah!
[81:22.77]Cheeto.
[81:27.91]985 scouts killed total.
[81:30.57]Was that a Jerma joke?
[81:31.81]No, it wasn't.
[81:32.27]That was me just claiming something that wasn't true.
[81:34.95]Well, maybe that is a Jerma joke, I guess.
[81:38.50]I don't even know what a Jerma joke is.
[81:39.96]I just say words.
[81:44.30]Easy.
[81:44.62]Don't break this.
[81:47.02]Don't break this desk that I got from the yard sale.
[81:51.09]This is a yard sale desk.
[81:52.43]It's worth a lot of money.
[81:54.15]Wait, did you really?
[81:54.95]I got this from a yard sale, yeah.
[81:56.11]So... Look, so... Not all of us can afford anything besides a... Look, this is... Here's the thing, guys.
[82:05.10]Find me a desk, right?
[82:07.20]Find me a desk that can fit, like, three monitors, is big, and has space for a keyboard.
[82:14.43]don't exist I went to Jordan's furniture in avon you went to like a what Jordan's furniture in avon Massachusetts is the biggest like best furniture store around and they didn't like Jordan's and avon by the way you know where I got um most of my furniture from my condo I got it from uh west elm
[82:42.12]Oh, well.
[82:43.48]Yeah, but I mean, this has got to be sturdy.
[82:44.96]Is that stuff sturdy?
[82:47.61]Get a dining table?
[82:48.53]I got some stuff from, like, CD2, too.
[82:51.23]Well, I mean, this thing does alright.
[82:53.27]Crate and barrel, dude.
[82:55.37]You know me and those plates that we go way back.
[82:58.50]Hold on, I've got to be the scout killer.
[82:59.56]There's, like, three scouts in here.
[83:00.66]Trevor, the fucking scout killer.
[83:01.84]Dude, you suck.
[83:04.30]There's three scouts.
[83:05.52]I can't, look, I might be the scout killer, but I can't take on three at the same time.
[83:10.17]You know what I'm saying?
[83:11.98]Like, you can be the scout killer, but when you have, like, look, uh... If, let's say I was a... Hold on, what did he want me to do?
[83:22.08]That was bad.
[83:28.73]Dermot sucks.
[83:29.37]No, I had three scouts.
[83:31.95]Take your ass down to Ikea.
[83:33.01]Yeah, but Ikea, like, here's the thing about Ikea.
[83:37.03]Ikea is great for random shit, but they don't have stuff like that.
[83:42.72]Honestly, to have like a three monitor setup, you need a dining room table.
[83:48.32]You gotta have a dining room table.
[83:50.04]And you gotta attach something for your keyboard.
[83:54.25]Did I just vote for Harvest?
[83:56.01]I did not, did I?
[83:57.39]I really hope I didn't.
[83:58.25]Did I just absentmindedly click that button?
[84:01.78]What's in the Jordans and Avon?
[84:03.02]Oh, let me tell you.
[84:03.94]What?
[84:06.67]Bullshit.
[84:07.35]What?
[84:08.05]Dog shit.
[84:09.73]Jordan's Furniture and Avon has good stuff.
[84:12.63]Okay, so think of Jordan's Furniture and then think of a public bathroom and then dog food all over it.
[84:21.32]You know, Elliot would have something to say about that.
[84:23.04]The guy that owns the place.
[84:24.58]He would be like, wow, that's unbelievable here.
[84:27.60]Why am I here again?
[84:28.34]I don't want to be in.
[84:29.10]I'm going to leave.
[84:33.88]I remember when they put that in.
[84:36.26]Get a corner desk?
[84:38.25]Eh.
[84:38.41]I don't want to play on harvest again.
[84:40.81]I really don't.
[84:42.01]I'm going to leave.
[84:44.09]Oh, let's go to... I want to play payload.
[84:50.28]Payload and... That's fine.
[84:54.40]Let's go.
[84:56.58]Am I doing this right?
[84:57.38]Hopefully I'm doing this right.
[84:58.70]Jordan's furniture sounds like someone thought of furniture in the next state over.
[85:06.01]No, that's not true.
[85:06.77]Jordan's furniture is cool.
[85:08.61]Hey, Jordan's furniture has mom.
[85:12.05]You remember the ride mom?
[85:13.43]You mean me?
[85:14.37]No, the ride mom.
[85:15.75]M-O-M.
[85:17.09]How many of you guys know what Jordan's furniture in Avon is?
[85:19.33]Matt, you Massachusetts guys.
[85:23.67]Dude, they have a ride.
[85:24.95]There's a ride in the store called mom.
[85:28.25]It's fucking fantastic.
[85:29.55]Oh my god.
[85:30.83]The Jordans furniture in Reading.
[85:32.13]Mm-hmm.
[85:33.25]It has like a legit roller coaster in it.
[85:34.97]Yeah, it's mom.
[85:36.07]That's mom.
[85:37.07]No, no, no, no.
[85:37.75]Yeah, that's mom.
[85:38.51]It's like a little cart.
[85:39.59]You know the dragon ride at the fair?
[85:41.57]Yeah, it's mom.
[85:42.93]That's mom.
[85:43.55]That is mom.
[85:44.89]That's disgusting.
[85:45.65]What's disgusting?
[85:47.37]You ride mom.
[85:48.54]No, no, no, no.
[85:48.92]Wait, wait, wait.
[85:50.34]Wait a second.
[85:50.82]Wait a second.
[85:51.58]Wait a second.
[85:52.96]Yeah.
[85:53.06]The ride is called mom.
[85:54.12]You ride mom.
[85:56.06]Alright, let me try to rephrase this before Spencer bans this channel.
[86:00.42]First of all, Spencer, how are you going to ban a channel that can do something like this?
[86:03.77]Hold on.
[86:04.67]How are you going to ban a channel that can do stuff like this?
[86:12.96]You haven't done anything noteworthy.
[86:14.38]Hold on.
[86:20.11]I got bounced.
[86:22.62]What am I thinking?
[86:23.94]What the fuck am I thinking?
[86:24.78]Why would I not have the Huntsman on?
[86:26.88]I don't think there is a Jordan's Furniture in Cambridge, by the way.
[86:29.98]You might be thinking about... Something else.
[86:34.88]Writing that, mom?
[86:38.40]Oh my fucking god.
[86:41.12]Alright, Spencer.
[86:41.88]Wait, what is that voice?
[86:42.56]Let's slam down these drinks.
[86:51.99]You guys want me to go back to my old stomping grounds here?
[86:54.51]Fine.
[86:56.23]I will.
[86:56.67]In a minute.
[86:57.55]Once I get used to this again.
[87:01.87]That would've hit.
[87:04.41]Use code RIDEMOM.
[87:10.49]I got a feeling I ain't gonna live that one down.
[87:12.71]No, you're not.
[87:15.15]You're making me want to learn how to ban you.
[87:17.40]Did you like the drink?
[87:19.04]No, it's good.
[87:19.86]It matches very well.
[87:24.45]Uh, somebody gave some money, but let me... get used to this again.
[87:28.77]Spencer, bang him.
[87:32.57]Did you see that shit?
[87:33.45]No.
[87:33.82]I got that guy.
[87:36.44]Use the scatter arrow.
[87:38.10]Dude, the Huntsman is the best weapon.
[87:40.32]The most fun in this whole game.
[87:44.78]Oh, this guy's really angry with me.
[87:47.46]What should I say?
[87:52.01]No, I'm just gonna be like, I'm sorry.
[87:57.52]Dude, like... Am I really gonna put on this stupid fucking thing?
[88:05.52]I'm gonna put on the Razorback.
[88:06.52]I'm gonna be a total shithead.
[88:12.58]Hold on.
[88:13.52]Even better.
[88:16.32]I need to make that an emote, by the way.
[88:17.58]I don't know why I haven't.
[88:21.48]Aim in the general direction and get a headshot.
[88:23.32]Yeah, that usually is how it works.
[88:29.26]see ya now let's do that like five times like 10 more oh that's an uber run you gotta hit yeah what does it mean when people are hosting you that means that somebody is uh not streaming but whoever is in their chat yeah they host your stream so they essentially they've restreamed your stream to the people in their chat
[88:55.72]your stream is getting hosted a lot yeah I think there's like an auto host thing now oh no what have you done this is not smart not something you should have done you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have done this oh okay time to switch it didn't look like you were doing so well uh he crit sprayed me arguably like arguably the worst thing you could ever do arguably
[89:22.25]Uh, but any... Who else came in here?
[89:24.40]Uh, Ahon, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[89:27.92]Been here since the start of Scare Saturdays.
[89:30.06]Good Siri.
[89:31.64]And I gotta say, you've helped me through a lot, Jerma, from a harsh day of school to just simply lonely days.
[89:36.50]Your videos were there to put a smile on my face.
[89:38.63]I'm in my early 20s now and actually doing well on my own.
[89:41.23]So I can't thank you enough.
[89:42.87]Keep up the great streams and do what you want to do.
[89:44.85]I'll always be here.
[89:45.49]Take care.
[89:46.88]Well, that's very touching.
[89:48.76]You are... You all are very important to me.
[89:52.56]So, make sure you know that.
[89:54.34]Solid, Pat.
[89:54.76]Thanks for the $5.
[89:55.86]Thanks for this nostalgia stream, man.
[89:58.42]I know you're saying this wasn't that special, but it's awesome seeing this game again.
[90:00.95]Also, I'm loving the movies series on the second channel.
[90:04.07]They're almost as addicting to watch and re-watch as the old GTA 4 videos with Ster.
[90:08.73]Well, you can, like, again, you can thank Holy Mac for these videos because he's doing a fucking hell of a job.
[90:15.59]You still don't get the bottle you can have whatever the hell he wants Should I do Demoknight you guys think The movies are so good Yeah shit what the hell killed me I
[90:44.16]Jeremy's shit is bread?
[90:45.68]Oh, no, my asshole is bread.
[90:46.98]Yeah, that's correct.
[90:49.34]I do have a bread asshole, that's correct.
[90:53.22]It's from a video where I showed my naked pictures.
[90:58.43]Not really, though, but kind of.
[90:59.83]I don't joke.
[91:02.07]No!
[91:02.97]I'm not showing boy, little boy pictures.
[91:12.13]Are there no more daily videos on Second Jerma?
[91:16.25]I mean, fuck it.
[91:16.81]February was a way to catch up on old videos.
[91:20.89]Kalem, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's still... There's still a lot of... Alright, that's not going to work.
[91:25.98]I need to... I don't like it.
[91:31.42]Give me... You know what?
[91:34.12]Fuck it.
[91:34.52]We're just doing this.
[91:36.36]I don't even care.
[91:39.26]What is this?
[91:39.92]I don't even care about any of this stuff.
[91:41.25]Put it in?
[91:41.53]No.
[91:42.76]So yes?
[91:43.98]No, I'm not talking about that.
[91:44.68]I'm talking about these.
[91:45.22]I was going to craft a hat.
[91:46.32]I was going to craft a hat.
[91:49.47]Let's do lock and load.
[91:50.43]No.
[91:50.99]Let's do Loose Cannon.
[91:54.25]Charge and charge.
[91:55.27]That's good.
[91:56.21]Let's actually play Demoman.
[92:04.38]I love this thing.
[92:05.94]Didn't they make this thing better?
[92:09.64]From my understanding.
[92:11.12]This guy's still here.
[92:12.90]Are you serious?
[92:13.58]Nobody killed him?
[92:14.48]I didn't kill him.
[92:18.43]How is that possible?
[92:24.73]Shit.
[92:26.43]Come on!
[92:27.15]That wasn't a double dunk.
[92:30.73]It's been too long.
[92:32.57]Thank you medic for killing- Thank you medic for doing something that I was supposed to do, but I couldn't do it.
[92:39.54]I fucking love this thing.
[92:41.20]You want to know an item that will keep me coming back to Team Fortress?
[92:44.68]It's this.
[92:45.06]Let's see if I can... I gotta dock this guy, though.
[93:07.93]Wow!
[93:10.01]No, I don't have a sticky launcher.
[93:11.39]Actually, bad that I don't have a sticky launcher.
[93:17.32]Dude, that drink is really good.
[93:18.58]I wish we had more of it.
[93:21.71]It is really good.
[93:22.51]It is really good.
[93:23.47]You can always get more.
[93:28.01]Too bad you're bad.
[93:29.05]I mean, yes, I am bad.
[93:32.50]I haven't played this game in like seven and a half months.
[93:35.34]So yes, I am not good at Team Fortress anymore.
[93:37.80]Sorry.
[93:39.38]You haven't done a single thing with this gun.
[93:43.55]Look, alright.
[93:45.83]Guys, guys.
[93:48.58]You can't just, like, come back to something you haven't done in, like, a year.
[93:52.36]And even when I played it a year ago, I played it for 10 minutes.
[93:55.28]Like, maybe like an hour.
[93:56.47]Maybe.
[94:00.47]I apologize if you came to this stream and you thought this was gonna be, like, high-level TF2.
[94:03.51]That's not what you're gonna get.
[94:04.57]You're gonna get a guy that's trying to remember how to ride a bike.
[94:21.90]Was I ever good?
[94:22.65]Yes, I was, Spencer.
[94:23.97]I'm sorry, like, I was.
[94:26.59]Go back to watch, like, my old, like, 2012 scout videos where I got, like, 30 kills in one life.
[94:30.95]Come on.
[94:31.45]My one-life gameplays.
[94:33.17]Those were good.
[94:34.03]Okay, go on.
[94:34.51]Sorry.
[94:37.75]Did you not just listen to the haiku that I was saying?
[94:39.95]Oh, I was kind of.
[94:41.17]I was too busy being angry with people telling me I wasn't good at this game.
[94:45.27]Abnormality gave you 100 bits, so thank you for that.
[94:48.67]And also, they wrote us a haiku.
[94:51.80]Like two strong frog legs, you're a very cute couple.
[94:54.50]Can we be best friends?
[94:56.24]Well, two strong frog legs are, you know.
[94:59.00]He was never good.
[94:59.86]I was good.
[95:01.60]I was very good at this game.
[95:03.40]Come on, guys.
[95:05.73]I did very well in this game.
[95:09.57]Not anymore.
[95:10.93]Not for a long time, but I did.
[95:12.51]I used to be very good.
[95:20.42]And plus, this is like the nostalgia penis stream.
[95:24.12]Penis?
[95:24.54]What?
[95:25.58]What did I say that for?
[95:32.50]Still got it.
[95:33.16]He got that one spy accidentally.
[95:34.94]Still got it.
[95:47.95]I don't think I'm going this way.
[95:49.15]It's all about the trajectory.
[95:52.28]I don't even remember the trajectory of this damn thing.
[95:55.06]Yeah, there's video evidence of me being good at this game.
[96:02.07]I don't have to say a damn thing.
[96:21.10]God.
[96:22.26]It's been too long.
[96:24.84]That's just what I can attribute it to.
[96:25.97]I stopped caring a very long time ago about this type of thing.
[96:31.89]You guys know that.
[96:36.63]Guys, I'm 38.
[96:37.74]Do you think I care about being good at lock and load right now?
[96:40.80]I'm 39.
[96:42.30]My 40th birthday is in two weeks.
[96:43.82]You know what I'm saying?
[96:51.06]I seriously can't hit a goddamn thing.
[96:55.71]I may as well just be a distraction to this team.
[97:06.15]Give me a fucking break.
[97:07.05]I just got crit!
[97:08.31]No.
[97:08.99]I ain't gonna do Demoman right now.
[97:12.58]What's going on?
[97:15.04]Did someone just call me a garlic streamer?
[97:18.82]What does that mean?
[97:28.74]I'd be like, you guys talk to me when your 40th birthday is coming up.
[97:32.78]I'm doing pretty... I'm doing pretty... 39.
[97:34.67]30, 39.
[97:34.77]Wait, hold on.
[97:57.78]Wheelbarrow streamer, don't ever call me that again.
[98:00.18]It's a fucking goose streamer.
[98:05.62]Wait, what?
[98:08.09]Dude, I... I have this.
[98:14.61]This right here.
[98:18.01]It's only one ear, but... It's okay, I'm just doing some creeping.
[98:22.40]Just creeping?
[98:23.36]Yeah.
[98:24.12]It's hard.
[98:24.94]You're doing some creeping?
[98:26.10]What, like on my stream?
[98:27.29]Like, you're in the room.
[98:29.07]No, no, not on you.
[98:30.89]On what?
[98:32.13]I'm creeping on someone right now.
[98:33.29]Who are you creeping on?
[98:34.25]I can tell you after.
[98:36.75]Alright.
[98:38.21]All righty.
[98:40.14]Full head of gray hair?
[98:40.80]Yeah.
[98:41.28]It's coming up soon.
[98:46.38]I just want white hair, you know?
[98:49.88]Watch out for the spy box.
[98:54.55]I gotta play something that is not gonna require very much brain power.
[98:57.52]Alright, we're going black box.
[99:03.98]Good old black box.
[99:08.68]The George Foreman streamer?
[99:12.92]Take the teleporter.
[99:13.60]I forgot teleporters existed in TF2.
[99:16.59]That's how you know I haven't played this game in like four years.
[99:19.59]Teleporter didn't even there.
[99:20.41]I got lied to.
[99:22.25]What?
[99:29.25]Soldier mains.
[99:30.85]I hate a soldier main.
[99:31.71]I'm just trying.
[99:32.33]Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[99:34.23]And we're going to do some work here, okay?
[99:36.89]Not right now, because I'm probably going to die.
[99:39.69]Here we go.
[99:40.03]This life right here.
[99:41.15]I'm going to do some work, I promise.
[99:44.11]I promise.
[99:44.51]I'm going to put the direct hit on.
[99:49.19]I'm going to do some shit.
[99:58.52]Alright.
[100:04.21]Time to be quiet.
[100:04.83]Time to do some work.
[100:05.35]Here we go.
[100:21.52]I got crit right there.
[100:22.20]Not fair.
[100:25.38]I got crit twice.
[100:26.28]I got crit two times.
[100:28.30]It's not fair.
[100:29.21]I would have got that guy.
[100:34.77]I would have actually got that guy.
[100:39.01]What?
[100:39.45]The directive doesn't require brain power?
[100:41.43]No, you're right.
[100:41.81]It does.
[100:42.07]I'm going in.
[100:49.07]Going in.
[100:50.47]Nobody there.
[100:51.22]Oh, fuck.
[100:51.68]There's nobody here.
[100:54.54]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[100:55.60]It's okay.
[100:57.46]Sentry down.
[100:57.88]Another sentry over there.
[101:02.70]Or is there?
[101:07.30]There is a sentry over there.
[101:08.25]Fuck.
[101:11.17]Pog?
[101:11.65]Jupiter?
[101:18.77]Will you ever do a calm stream again?
[101:20.79]Yes, I will.
[101:21.87]Definitely.
[101:22.21]Oh, now we're getting spawn camp.
[101:25.25]I thought about it.
[101:29.46]I was... I wanted... The VR thing was like what I wanted to do and then just... That shit hit the fan hard and we lost.
[101:38.55]We lose.
[101:43.41]Oh well.
[101:44.97]Pog Jupiter would be good.
[101:50.06]Oh, I'm dead.
[101:52.40]Well, shit.
[101:54.66]Your name is Fred, stop stealing my name.
[101:59.80]You bet.
[102:00.32]My Jordans doesn't have a jellybean store.
[102:03.16]Uh, Jordan's does this thing every year.
[102:04.44]It's called the Miracle of Christmas.
[102:05.76]That's not what it's called.
[102:07.52]It's called the Enchanted Village.
[102:09.38]It's really fun.
[102:11.76]They have, like, a huge Christmas setup.
[102:13.32]Uh, they do all kinds of cool things.
[102:17.36]Hmm?
[102:18.32]Yeah, we, my, uh, we actually did go last year.
[102:21.29]It was great.
[102:21.67]Oh, you did?
[102:22.41]Mm-hmm.
[102:24.43]Alright, I'm gonna say this is gonna be the last map.
[102:28.62]And then I'm going to go chill.
[102:30.46]Just wanted to wind down a little bit.
[102:32.10]You'll probably see this game again.
[102:34.56]You'll see this game again.
[102:37.15]I actually am having fun.
[102:38.23]And I kind of want to get better.
[102:40.47]And I'm always looking for new things to play.
[102:42.29]And the line is 17 miles long.
[102:46.43]It's great though.
[102:46.91]It's great fun.
[102:51.89]End it with an unboxing.
[102:54.69]Um...
[102:57.79]If I have a key, I'll open a crate.
[102:59.15]I don't want to buy keys right now.
[103:01.93]I don't think my PayPal is synced up at the moment.
[103:06.07]It's been a long time.
[103:09.29]Except I want to play Engineer.
[103:11.83]This is one of my favorite maps to play Engineer on.
[103:14.61]Let's be good for once, right?
[103:20.87]Don't play any more indie games.
[103:24.53]The PSVR is not an indie game.
[103:25.81]It's just...
[103:27.03]badly made.
[103:27.77]Alright, no, you know, okay, I'm done.
[103:28.95]I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna dogshit talk the PSVR.
[103:34.43]Because, you know what, the first couple experiences I had with it were fantastic.
[103:41.00]Resident Evil 7 on PSVR was great.
[103:43.78]It was great.
[103:44.96]I didn't have a single issue with it at all.
[103:46.56]It was perfect.
[103:49.38]Oh my god.
[103:52.04]What's up?
[103:52.76]I was, like, thinking about...
[103:54.75]psvr yeah psvr like playing resume but like I'm still like stuck in that boat and I don't want to play it anymore oh yeah she got to the worst part of the game and was like yeah this is dumb I'm done he's like why did I why did I get all of these like weapons and stuff like that and then you take it away from me yeah the ship level is the dumbest thing if they just deleted the ship level that game and there's too many engineers I don't even which one's mine this one
[104:22.62]If they deleted that part, I would have loved the game.
[104:25.64]But I would say for me, after you get out of the house and you go on the ship, that's pretty much it for me.
[104:34.09]I'm like, alright, I'm done.
[104:36.59]Yeah.
[104:38.91]Somebody could make that complaint about... No, the PSVR is fun.
[104:42.69]It's just those move controllers...
[104:46.65]I just don't see how it's possible to stand that far away from your PS Camera.
[104:51.50]With those Move Controllers, well, the headset has to be plugged into like a three-foot cable.
[104:55.34]It's like impossible.
[104:57.82]It's a very, very hard thing to do.
[105:01.54]I was getting very mad.
[105:02.70]Very frustrated.
[105:04.50]Rightfully so, I think.
[105:05.46]I want this.
[105:10.96]I do not stream because I do not have a setup.
[105:16.50]Yeah.
[105:17.04]Maybe eventually you could start doing something.
[105:18.78]Maybe.
[105:19.96]If you felt like it.
[105:24.55]Let's get some stuff.
[105:25.51]Let's get it going here.
[105:27.19]I saw a full Jupiter from Spencer, so, like, he got it going.
[105:29.63]So it's time for me to get it going for my final game in TF2.
[105:31.85]There's an extension cable.
[105:35.01]Yeah, I know, but, like, where is that damn thing?
[105:38.15]It wasn't in the box?
[105:38.89]I have to go, like, buy an extension cable to play the fucking game standing up?
[105:44.49]I didn't see an extension cable in my set.
[105:47.37]Unless I'm crazy.
[105:58.28]Really?
[105:58.54]Did we actually just get everything?
[106:00.80]Did someone just take an emote of my eyes?
[106:04.01]Uh... No, that's just the eye emote.
[106:06.81]I was like, what?
[106:08.45]Does it come with an... Okay, if the PSVR comes with an extension cable in the box...
[106:14.26]Like INSIDE the PSVR box, then I will eat all my words and I will say I'm sorry.
[106:19.48]But when I unboxed that thing, it was... I didn't see something like that.
[106:27.43]It was just like the PSVR and the stuff needed to plug it in.
[106:29.57]Oh my god.
[106:34.93]Let's do some dead room.
[106:38.87]Get rid of this shit.
[106:40.59]Uh, give me the... where is it?
[106:41.65]The kunai.
[106:43.83]Now this is 2012, Jerma.
[106:46.83]Should be in the box.
[106:49.69]I did buy it third party, though, guys.
[106:51.51]Like, that's something really important to keep in mind.
[106:54.72]I didn't buy this thing from GameStop.
[106:56.20]I bought it third party.
[106:58.32]So, I don't know.
[106:59.12]Who fucking knows?
[107:00.94]Why did that not go off?
[107:07.19]Why include an extension cable instead of making the base cable longer?
[107:09.91]And even if there was an extension cable, it still would be really awkward because it has to plug into the little square box.
[107:20.57]I can't even do anything.
[107:22.03]Alright, I'm not going out on that one.
[107:24.49]That was dumb.
[107:29.52]I just got fucking owned.
[107:30.30]Couldn't even do anything.
[107:35.44]Hey, some bits came in that I missed.
[107:39.12]Um... Okay, right here.
[107:47.08]Abnormality for $5 says... Oh, that's the haiku.
[107:49.88]Thank you for the haiku.
[107:51.04]It was beautiful.
[107:53.19]Jared0510 says, I remember when I found myself in a Jerma TF2 video and he told me to fuck off and go back to Subway after I killed him too many times.
[108:02.77]Actually, I remember that.
[108:04.61]I remember that, Jared.
[108:06.61]Thank you for killing me.
[108:09.42]And thank you for the $5 as well.
[108:10.68]Oh, silly scope.
[108:12.90]$4 is banned for nostalgia penis cream.
[108:15.94]We're not banned yet.
[108:16.93]We're still here.
[108:18.53]We're still around.
[108:19.90]And, uh, WhyMalu52 for 10 bucks says, I already shared my sappy message earlier, but I was unable to donate on my phone.
[108:27.77]This is my first time donating, and I'm also very bad at spending money, but this is worth every cent.
[108:32.09]Thank you so much for the laughs, Jerma.
[108:33.87]Also, no one can pronounce my name correctly.
[108:36.55]Did I?
[108:36.89]WhyMalu?
[108:38.01]Maybe?
[108:38.73]Well, thank you for the $10.
[108:40.11]Very, very nice message.
[108:41.01]Thank you.
[108:42.70]NeverTrustAPurple came in with $5.
[108:44.06]I'm willing to supply some keys if you unbox.
[108:46.20]Oh, goodness.
[108:48.49]Uh, maybe.
[108:51.11]Maybe, we'll see.
[108:51.79]Maybe I'll do that another time.
[108:53.63]Maybe I'll do like an unboxing start to a stream or something like that, maybe.
[108:57.52]Uh, Grimoire, thank you for the $5.
[108:58.62]You had a really rough last week and especially today with panic attacks and midterms.
[109:04.38]Well, damn, dude.
[109:05.56]Hopefully you did okay.
[109:06.98]This stream... I'm gonna burp in your face, dude, and I don't want to because this is a nice message.
[109:11.45]This stream tonight has been the highlight of my 2017.
[109:14.47]Really?
[109:14.83]Damn, man.
[109:15.85]That's so fucking humbling.
[109:18.77]I'm so, like... That's incredibly touching to say.
[109:22.96]Been watching you since 2012.
[109:23.84]Thanks for the years of good time.
[109:26.40]Tonight and all the future joy you'll bring to me and all your other fans.
[109:28.88]Well, hopefully you aced your midterms, man.
[109:31.46]Really.
[109:32.28]Take care, man.
[109:33.62]Take care.
[109:35.58]And then here's three bucks for keys for Snoss Rifle.
[109:37.42]Thank you, Snoss Rifle.
[109:40.83]Now we're gonna win.
[109:44.07]Burp.
[109:44.39]Do it.
[109:44.79]Do it.
[109:48.63]No, I'm not gonna, like, burp.
[109:49.95]I'm reading somebody's, like, nice message.
[109:51.30]I ain't gonna, like... Why?
[109:52.64]Did they change the Dead Ringer?
[109:54.92]His burp is a wuss burp.
[109:56.64]My burp, however... Oh, no, no, no.
[109:59.50]No, no, no, no.
[110:00.92]No.
[110:01.80]No.
[110:02.34]We'll get banned.
[110:02.76]My burp is a real burp.
[110:05.10]Dude, her burp will wake up children down the street.
[110:10.28]It's fucking intense.
[110:13.58]Y'all can find that burp at PAX East.
[110:16.22]Yeah, she'll burp in your face for a dollar.
[110:20.16]No, I don't want to say that.
[110:21.76]That's, like, not fucking true.
[110:23.42]And where am I going?
[110:24.16]I'm, like, laughing.
[110:26.04]God, I'm like a dumb dickhead with a syringe gun out.
[110:28.41]This is not going to work.
[110:30.53]Dude, my burp is fucking for real.
[110:33.39]Like, it is a real burp.
[110:36.61]It's heinous.
[110:37.15]Oh, it's heinous.
[110:37.75]Dude, you have a wuss little boy burp.
[110:40.05]Yeah, because I go, like... Like, when I have to burp, I like to, like... I'm one of those people that's, like...
[110:48.20]Like, I swallow it a little bit.
[110:50.96]He tries to hide it.
[110:52.16]Yeah, because I don't want to, like, fucking... I have, like, a fucking... Yeah, I'm not an animal.
[110:57.66]I burp louder than that.
[110:59.66]Yeah, I am, like... Well, the speed boost.
[111:03.36]Stupid.
[111:07.02]That was so loud.
[111:08.44]This guy definitely knows I'm here.
[111:09.44]What do you got in here?
[111:10.94]You're definitely in the engineer spot.
[111:12.46]No, you're not in the engineer spot.
[111:13.62]Interesting.
[111:14.12]Okay.
[111:16.00]I really thought you were going to be in the engineer spot.
[111:21.64]Damn it, I knew that was going to fucking happen.
[111:24.56]No, this ain't happening either.
[111:26.98]Um... We're just going Punch Heavy to end the stream.
[111:32.12]Punch Heavy with the... Just Punch Heavy.
[111:33.99]Do I have a Rick Sanchez burp?
[111:35.51]Uh, no.
[111:36.47]My burp is way better than Rick Sanchez's.
[111:39.89]Thank you.
[111:41.71]Morty!
[111:42.81]Morty!
[111:44.13]Yeah, I have a Rick Sanchez burp.
[111:46.99]But Skull and Dolan gave $100...
[111:50.69]And they say Skålen.
[111:51.57]That's more money from Skålen.
[111:54.49]Or Skålen.
[111:54.93]Hopefully I'm saying that right.
[111:55.71]Skålendalen.
[111:57.50]Well, you're gonna get more of those.
[112:07.84]There's definitely more videos that are going to be much, much more ridiculous.
[112:12.56]The goal here, guys, is to make every, like, next video, like, a little bit higher on the scale than the last one.
[112:18.34]So, the next video on the main channel, like, the next, like, Jerma985 video is going to be a very, very large, expensive project.
[112:29.15]And I really hope you guys enjoy it, because it's going to be a lot of fun to make.
[112:31.37]It's not Jerma Rumble.
[112:33.56]Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[112:38.78]Thank you for... Welcome to the Jerma Gets a Vibe Fund.
[112:43.48]In all honesty, though, like, this... It's very kind of you guys.
[112:47.66]Let's get some punches.
[112:50.03]We're going straight up punches.
[112:51.55]Oh, yeah, it's backfiring.
[112:53.91]The Seattle one.
[112:56.53]It's the one in Seattle.
[112:58.35]Seattle.
[113:00.05]Oh, my God, I can't wait to go to that.
[113:02.09]It's going to be fun.
[113:03.09]I can't wait to visit Seattle.
[113:05.06]Not sure if the reference is lost, but...
[113:08.09]How can you beat the Jerma Rumble?
[113:10.83]By doing something even more stupid.
[113:14.34]Dude, the next... I don't want to ruin anything, but honest to God, there's going to be two more Jerma Wrestling Universe videos.
[113:23.54]One of them makes no fucking sense, and I can't wait to do it.
[113:28.11]Who photoshopped my face on this?
[113:30.65]What is it?
[113:31.05]Let me see it.
[113:31.95]Let me see it.
[113:32.45]What is it?
[113:32.87]What is it?
[113:33.85]Dude, who photoshopped my face on that?
[113:36.71]Suck a fart out of my ass.
[113:38.57]Dude, holy mack, who photoshopped my face onto that?
[113:42.54]He did.
[113:43.72]You did.
[113:44.16]That was probably from like one of the pic, like, yeah.
[113:48.64]He's like a, he's like a photoshop whiz.
[113:50.26]He just like, bang, bang.
[113:52.97]But, yeah, the video... Where did you get this screenshot?
[113:55.93]Where did you get this?
[113:57.35]I think that's from the picture of me and you standing in the mirror.
[114:00.87]Oh, yeah, there's the phone right there.
[114:02.89]Oh, God.
[114:03.47]Alright, so you want to tell you what the video is?
[114:05.47]Here's the only hint you guys are going to get.
[114:08.03]We are... Here's the only one.
[114:09.41]This is the only hint.
[114:10.71]It's a Jerma wrestling video.
[114:13.21]Jerma Rumble Wrestling.
[114:14.39]Not Rumble, but Jerma Wrestling Federation.
[114:17.60]It's going to be filmed in Asia.
[114:19.40]It's a school play.
[114:21.43]There you go.
[114:21.97]There's the only thing you're gonna get from that.
[114:24.11]You are going to get a school play version of a Jerma wrestling event.
[114:28.61]What the fuck does that mean?
[114:29.55]You're gonna have to fucking find out.
[114:32.41]Good luck.
[114:33.81]But that's eventually going to happen.
[114:36.24]Hope you guys are ready for the fucking musical school play Jerma wrestling event.
[114:41.99]filmed in a high school auditorium.
[114:44.75]Yeah.
[114:45.39]So there you go.
[114:46.13]I just told you what the video was.
[114:47.53]Whatever.
[114:50.44]Well, that's not the next one, but that's, like, gonna be soon.
[114:56.90]Are we going in?
[114:57.74]Are we doing this?
[114:58.84]Are we going in hard?
[115:00.74]He's not dead, but, like, you pop that, we're gonna get, like, fucking five people, man.
[115:06.23]Oh, they're already popping.
[115:07.89]Oh, come on.
[115:08.41]Come on.
[115:08.69]Come on.
[115:10.13]Come on.
[115:10.33]I got to make this happen.
[115:10.98]Come on.
[115:11.72]Oh, you don't want to do it, man.
[115:12.66]Do it.
[115:13.46]Why did you?
[115:14.60]Why did you?
[115:15.42]Why did you?
[115:16.08]Why did you not do it?
[115:17.08]Why did we had so many people here?
[115:20.35]It's going to be a Germanium musical with like painted sets.
[115:25.87]It's gonna be so dumb, I can't wait.
[115:28.65]And we're going to literally have originally written songs.
[115:32.91]And there's gonna be an old fucking lady playing the piano.
[115:36.69]We're gonna hire an old lady.
[115:38.27]You know back when you were a kid and you were in school plays?
[115:40.85]And there was always that old lady that played the piano for the whole thing?
[115:44.15]We're getting one of those.
[115:47.57]Bet your ass.
[115:51.14]There we go.
[115:51.70]Come on.
[115:52.64]Come on.
[115:53.96]No, why does it have to be a fucking level 3 sentry gun right here?
[116:00.10]Why was there a level 3 sentry gun?
[116:03.84]It's a Broadway show?
[116:04.82]No.
[116:12.55]You're buying an old lady piano person.
[116:14.99]And there's going to be like a band too.
[116:17.67]We're going to get a school band.
[116:22.28]You better believe that that school band is going to be no higher than the 8th grade.
[116:27.96]You understand?
[116:28.28]And it's going to be a wrestling video.
[116:43.05]It's going to be a wrestling video.
[116:45.47]Yeah.
[116:50.99]And we were thinking about actually doing it for real one night.
[116:55.69]And here's the thing, here's how this is going to work.
[116:58.07]The whole bit will probably be like an hour long.
[117:00.85]We're not doing takes.
[117:02.73]We're going to just do the whole thing all the way through.
[117:05.87]If anybody fucks up, it's staying in.
[117:09.40]Somebody forgets their line.
[117:10.52]Somebody fucks up a move in the wrestling ring that we have on the stage.
[117:14.56]It's staying in the video.
[117:17.30]No matter what.
[117:19.32]There's not going to be any cuts.
[117:21.93]We're doing the whole thing live.
[117:24.35]And I want to, like, we, like, me and, uh... I'm telling you guys, like, the whole video.
[117:28.35]What the fuck am I doing?
[117:29.27]I shouldn't be doing this.
[117:30.43]Hold on a second, let me get this going.
[117:31.47]Oh, fuck you, Sentry.
[117:38.33]Can't do anything about this, besides run.
[117:44.13]I told her, I told her, I told her, I told her.
[117:47.22]What's this game I'm playing?
[117:49.42]It's a team-based competitive shooter.
[117:52.77]called Scream Fortress.
[117:55.33]They decided to only have the Halloween update on at all times.
[117:58.84]I feel bad for that because that guy would have been alive.
[118:03.64]The only hint you get.
[118:06.72]I know, really.
[118:07.89]I'm just like sharing the whole script.
[118:10.23]Ah, fuck.
[118:12.11]Competitive feels bad.
[118:14.59]Jesus.
[118:16.89]He's like the best dog ever.
[118:20.82]Can I have your trade, Link?
[118:28.48]Screen Fortress, yeah.
[118:30.56]At least I'm not at the very bottom.
[118:32.04]That's what I was scared of.
[118:32.84]I was scared I was going to be at the bottom of this list.
[118:40.87]He's just looking at me like... He just gave me the eyes like, what's happening?
[118:45.85]There's so many heavies.
[118:46.75]We need to over right now.
[118:51.04]Leaked the script online.
[118:53.10]No.
[118:54.20]The next video, though, ain't going to be like anything you guys have ever seen me do.
[119:00.01]Ever.
[119:02.39]Oh, really?
[119:02.85]Come on.
[119:05.77]Damn it.
[119:06.19]Fuck.
[119:08.87]uh never touch purple a thousand bits thanks for the 10 bucks dude so Jerma you probably think that we've forgotten but I remember during a fistful of frag stream mentioned ideas to get danny devito into your next rumble I want an update danny devito will never be in one of my videos not a chance man I would have to pay like probably 60 or 70 000 to have him appear for like 30 seconds
[119:38.97]Shit.
[119:39.65]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[119:44.00]I'm not doing so hot.
[119:46.82]My dude, you saw me yesterday.
[119:47.82]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[119:50.54]I'm the trash man.
[119:52.30]Yeah, maybe that'd be great, but no, it's not gonna happen.
[120:00.44]How's my game frozen?
[120:05.35]That's an oddly specific amount, I know.
[120:07.61]I mean, you have to assume, right?
[120:16.28]Why am I throwing the game?
[120:17.14]My game is freezing.
[120:19.44]My alt tab just crashed the game for some reason.
[120:22.56]What if Danny DeVito was a Jerma fan?
[120:24.38]No.
[120:24.86]There's no way.
[120:25.66]Danny DeVito has way more important shit to do than care about who I am.
[120:34.15]David DeVito.
[120:35.95]You guys know what to do.
[120:36.61]Let's open up a GoFundMe.
[120:38.97]No.
[120:40.41]Danny DeVito is going to read the GoFundMe page and be like, yeah, this is dumb.
[120:44.47]He's going to close the window.
[120:47.18]Thank you, ButtZ, for the 1400.
[120:49.94]Watching you for years, only now just getting into it.
[120:52.49]Well... Love you too, dude!
[120:55.09]Thanks a lot, Butt.
[120:58.03]And we're about to lose.
[121:01.15]Didn't notice the heavy right beside him.
[121:02.39]I mean, I'm like... I'm reading chat.
[121:04.33]A lot of people are sending me some very, like, nice messages.
[121:08.22]People have been dropping money, like... Yes, I... I am guilty of not paying that much attention to the video game at the moment.
[121:14.80]I'm very sorry.
[121:23.60]This guy's gonna kill me.
[121:26.28]The same guy with the crits.
[121:27.22]This guy's crit me like fucking five times.
[121:31.50]Fuck.
[121:35.12]Thank you, Butts, for your donation to get Danny DeVito a Vive for Jerma.
[121:40.61]Yeah, thank you for the get Danny DeVito to buy Jerma a Vive fund.
[121:49.93]Danny DeVito is a cool guy.
[121:51.17]I have no idea who the fuck he is.
[121:53.31]I know he's a guy that's on TV shows, and he's been in the Jerma Rumble.
[121:57.51]I mean, like, fucking come on.
[121:59.53]I, like, know that.
[122:00.21]At least I know that.
[122:01.31]My God, I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[122:03.03]I can't even turn the corner.
[122:03.95]We're just doing stickies.
[122:06.25]This is not going so well.
[122:08.17]I'm going to do this shit.
[122:32.55]I know, but I didn't.
[122:33.49]I'm sorry.
[122:34.37]I didn't take him out.
[122:37.63]Actually, no, he'll be okay until a little bit later.
[122:40.75]I'm done.
[122:41.09]I'm going to be done after this, so I'll take him out.
[122:44.41]Pubbing ain't easy, apparently, and I keep walking over here.
[122:47.55]I'm dying.
[122:48.93]Who just gave ten bucks?
[122:50.44]Roy Curbs.
[122:51.14]Hey, Jerma, you're a butt.
[122:52.26]Have some bucks.
[122:54.46]Thank you.
[122:55.44]Thank you, Roy.
[122:56.10]That's very kind of you.
[122:58.90]Much love, dude.
[123:01.09]I don't even know how much money has come in tonight.
[123:03.99]This is a lot of fucking money.
[123:07.39]Go walk your dog.
[123:09.02]He was out earlier, but I just wanted to make sure he'd been out.
[123:11.82]When did he go out?
[123:12.50]He went out at 10 o'clock.
[123:17.70]No, I took him out.
[123:18.86]What am I talking about?
[123:19.56]He's been out.
[123:22.02]Yeah, he has.
[123:25.43]Right when we got back, I took him out.
[123:28.43]Yeah, I did.
[123:29.05]I, like, just forgot about it.
[123:30.19]Because I'm fucking brainless.
[123:33.10]Alright, so here we go.
[123:34.48]I'm gonna get, like, four people right now.
[123:39.06]Or maybe not.
[123:39.44]Come on, somebody get on that cart.
[123:42.94]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[123:44.06]Oh my god.
[123:48.20]Seriously, I... I keep just instantly dying.
[123:53.78]No, it's because of just... There's nothing I can do.
[123:58.54]Start of the Danny DeVito wearing a gorilla costume driving a clown car in the Vive wrestling fun.
[124:06.71]Now we're just combining words, Purple.
[124:09.67]Alright, well.
[124:11.95]That's it.
[124:14.03]Way to take the NG medal.
[124:15.23]I'm just not even paying attention.
[124:20.94]Wait, what?
[124:24.86]Nice playing with you.
[124:26.14]Yeah.
[124:26.74]Alright.
[124:27.94]I think that's going to be it for tonight.
[124:29.30]The first hour of this stream was a fucking... It was like an hour and ten minutes.
[124:32.78]It was a disaster.
[124:34.68]But besides that, it was fun to play this for a couple hours, actually.
[124:38.19]I had a good time.
[124:39.81]You will see me play this again.
[124:43.17]But I do need to say, before I turn off the stream, let's move this out of here for a second.
[124:49.64]And quit out of here.
[124:52.17]I'm not against doing a stream where I unbox some stuff, maybe?
[124:56.77]At some point?
[124:59.93]Maybe at some point.
[125:02.20]But that's gonna be it.
[125:02.90]It's like 11.30 or so.
[125:05.28]I really did not... I wanted to go for like three hours.
[125:08.28]Three and a half hours or so, but... You know, this was like about three hours.
[125:12.02]It's just like... That first hour drained the fuck out of me.
[125:16.45]So badly.
[125:16.93]Okay.
[125:19.47]And, yeah.
[125:21.21]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[125:22.73]There was a ton, an extreme amount of support on stream tonight, so... Thank you.
[125:27.62]It was so nice.
[125:28.10]We're gonna read your messages later.
[125:29.54]Yeah, we'll be lying down just reading and loving every second of it, so... Good night, everybody.
[125:36.14]We'll see you at PAX East if you're coming.
[125:38.82]Yeah, if you go... Say hello.
[125:40.42]I've said this before.
[125:41.58]If you see me at PAX East in a couple weeks... Come say hi to us.
[125:45.00]Wave us down, because I would love to talk to you.
[125:49.47]I love sitting there and talking to you guys no matter how long you want to.
[125:52.16]Walk around, look at shit.
[125:53.97]All good, you know?
[125:55.65]But...
[125:57.39]We'll see you guys.
[126:00.99]Tomorrow is Wednesday, so I won't be streaming tomorrow.
[126:02.95]But I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[126:04.53]I want to do this movie.
[126:05.73]I've had this movie stream planned for like a week, and I haven't been able to capitalize at all on it.
[126:09.59]So we'll do that probably on Thursday or Friday, hopefully.
[126:12.22]So take care, everybody.
[126:14.48]Thank you so much, everyone, for the support.
[126:15.90]Thanks for everyone watching.
[126:17.16]I'm sorry the beginning of the stream like last night was a fucking disaster.
[126:20.70]But, you know, shit happens.
[126:22.88]You can't win them all, right?
[126:25.24]Take care, guys.
[126:26.08]See you soon.
[126:26.40]Good night.
[126:36.50]Wait, what?
