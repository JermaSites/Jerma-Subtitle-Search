[00:00.37]I activated the wrong thing.
[00:01.95]My microphone wasn't the thing I clicked.
[00:04.97]Good evening, everybody.
[00:06.53]Happy Tuesday.
[00:07.09]You know what that means.
[00:11.41]Oh, me.
[00:12.97]You get me on Tuesday.
[00:16.03]And on Monday, you had that other streamer, and maybe on Wednesday, you're going to get somebody else.
[00:20.48]But today, this is my time slot here on Tuesday.
[00:23.28]Tuesday afternoon here, Tuesday night with me, Jeremy.
[00:30.35]Hold on, let me just tweet that.
[00:31.43]I don't know how to title this.
[00:39.50]Vampire game.
[00:41.82]No, no, no, there we go.
[00:42.54]There's like a stupid emoji.
[00:45.48]On the iPhone.
[00:46.70]On Twitter.
[00:47.26]It's just Count Dracula.
[00:48.72]Okay, that's it.
[00:49.50]That's all I'm writing.
[00:51.08]It's gonna be the Count Dracula face.
[00:54.86]And then... My Tuesday Twitch link!
[01:02.89]Alright, here we go.
[01:04.15]Tweeting that, tweeting that.
[01:05.53]Here it is.
[01:05.97]Alright, we're going to play Vampyr tonight.
[01:12.28]I don't know, it could be really good, could be really bad.
[01:16.16]It's got pretty mixed reviews right now, but we're going to give it a try.
[01:22.59]What's the worst that could happen?
[01:24.47]It's not good?
[01:25.21]It's alright.
[01:30.94]By the way, the stream ended two days ago there without much after that because Dr. Schmoikson had to take off and I wanted to make sure that I saw him off and we had a couple of small conversations after that.
[01:45.42]But he really appreciates all the feedback.
[01:47.28]He's happy to know that you guys thought he was a really good schmoikin, so... Thank you for participating in that.
[01:54.52]That was a lot of fun.
[01:55.96]The lie detector test.
[02:00.77]And now, let's just go, man.
[02:03.49]Why not?
[02:06.79]Time to move.
[02:07.35]Do I have this all set up correctly?
[02:12.85]I think so.
[02:13.47]It might be loud.
[02:14.13]It shouldn't be, though.
[02:17.50]He's a pretty handsome guy.
[02:18.56]Alright, here we go.
[02:20.66]Let's do it.
[02:22.66]Let me know if it's too loud.
[02:23.88]Because it very well could be.
[02:28.96]You can see this, right?
[02:30.76]Alright, Vampyr.
[02:31.40]Here it is.
[02:31.76]Just came out.
[02:32.30]It's why the Life is Strange, people.
[02:40.65]He drank all of his Jim Beam.
[02:43.77]I did.
[02:44.03]It was a nice present.
[02:49.62]I feel like this is a loading screen.
[02:51.76]Oh, no.
[02:52.02]Okay.
[02:52.24]Alright.
[02:52.52]New game.
[02:54.13]In this game, difficulty is tied to your actions.
[02:56.63]I missed all of that, by the way.
[02:58.11]No idea.
[02:58.29]Twelve dreams for the Red Queen under Crown of Stone.
[03:02.91]Eight voracious beasts born from eight restless nights.
[03:07.59]Four nails piercing the flesh of the sinner.
[03:10.70]Hold on.
[03:11.28]One prayer for the summoned, called by this song.
[03:15.32]One to bind them, one to ride them, and the others to constrain them.
[03:18.86]Is this smash poetry or is this an intro?
[03:43.71]I saw them build such vain cities, crafting machines made for endless war.
[03:49.99]New questions flourished as old answers withered.
[03:53.62]What is darkness but lurking sun?
[03:56.90]What is war but enslaved stone?
[04:00.06]What is glass but tortured sand?
[04:03.62]What is song but a call to arms?
[04:06.81]What is hate but jilted love?
[04:10.15]What is life but death pending?
[04:18.67]Death.
[04:19.21]Since the apple was kept from the sacred tree, mortality was believed to be God's punishment.
[04:31.58]A righteous snare to keep mankind from ascending to the stars.
[04:37.53]They were all so wrong.
[04:40.96]Death is not a wicked thing, nor some holy retribution.
[04:48.42]A true punishment would be to never know its sweet kiss.
[04:54.89]True.
[04:55.93]Awaken from the harshness and be born once more.
[05:04.17]Can I clap now?
[05:05.41]Is he done?
[05:09.57]That was so good.
[05:14.75]Now this is his performance art after he does his poetry.
[05:17.47]He's fighting with the demons inside.
[05:24.82]Didn't we play this in Detroit Become Human?
[05:26.38]Do I have to go get an eyepiece and an earpiece?
[05:31.88]Pretty fast clapper.
[05:32.72]I am pretty fast.
[05:33.98]I am.
[05:35.56]By the way, Valentora, thanks for the $50.
[05:39.81]Thank you so much, Valentora.
[05:41.33]Huge drop of 5,000 bits here.
[05:45.09]They say, hey, gentlemen, is there any change to play Dark Souls Remastered?
[05:47.69]P.S.
[05:47.95]Thank you so much for getting me through high school with your TF2 videos.
[05:50.46]I'm a year into college, and now your streams are helping.
[05:55.05]Thank you so much for the $50.
[05:58.09]And hopefully, um... Hopefully you get through college.
[06:01.73]College is fun, but college is stressful at the same time.
[06:03.99]It's the most fun and the most stress I've ever had in a single, like, four or five years of my life.
[06:09.56]Oh, wait, I gotta move.
[06:10.32]But, uh, Dark Souls Remastered?
[06:13.66]Yes.
[06:14.72]Soon.
[06:16.58]I assume I gotta follow the blood trails.
[06:20.26]Did I pick up the shovel?
[06:25.24]Alright, I think I'm pretty sure it's gonna be XXYYBB for the combos.
[06:28.39]Try to take a guess.
[06:30.77]Oh, I gotta eat that guy.
[06:34.37]Yeah.
[06:36.71]Thirsty, so thirsty.
[06:40.85]Did they see me coming?
[06:45.95]I don't think this person... What is this lady doing?
[06:48.70]Apparently you don't hear me.
[06:50.14]Oh, now I hear you.
[07:00.35]What, she knows me?
[07:03.75]Oh, okay.
[07:07.75]Oh, shit.
[07:08.37]Real sad that I'm going to eat this lady.
[07:16.09]Oh, shit.
[07:20.63]Why would you do that, man?
[07:30.39]I mean, she still has a lot of blood left.
[07:31.78]That's gonna be my wife or something and I didn't even know it.
[07:40.88]My sweet brother.
[07:44.30]No, that was my sister.
[07:45.16]What have you done?
[07:46.88]Mary!
[07:48.54]No!
[07:50.64]God dammit.
[07:52.10]I thought you were just some random girl.
[07:57.13]It would have been okay otherwise.
[07:59.35]God dammit, it's okay to bite random women, but not my sister.
[08:04.87]This is so unfortunate.
[08:13.92]Oh, he's biting her again.
[08:26.64]I'm going to laugh my ass off if you can control time in this game.
[08:30.14]What if I hold down L2 and time rewinds?
[08:34.19]What have I done?
[08:38.93]This horror.
[08:40.83]It's a nightmare.
[08:43.93]Okay.
[08:46.37]Uh-oh.
[08:47.71]No!
[08:48.81]Please!
[08:49.49]A moment!
[08:49.87]Let me explain!
[08:52.43]How do you explain that?
[08:53.95]What do you mean, let me explain?
[09:00.39]There's no explaining that.
[09:01.43]How do you explain biting some lady and drinking her blood to death?
[09:05.17]No, you don't understand.
[09:06.31]No, don't shoot!
[09:07.43]Don't shoot me!
[09:10.31]This is a nightmare.
[09:14.24]I need to get out of here.
[09:16.42]I'm going.
[09:19.50]Is there a jump?
[09:20.28]No, there's no jump.
[09:23.95]This can't be happening.
[09:28.59]Over there!
[09:29.53]Over there, over there.
[09:30.59]Please, stop!
[09:32.13]I mean you no harm.
[09:33.77]That guy has a shotgun.
[09:42.04]I mean you no harm.
[09:43.64]Just the innocent women for me to drink.
[09:48.26]Oh, Mary.
[09:50.30]What have I done?
[09:51.94]What's all this about?
[09:54.55]Ooh, machete.
[09:57.49]Press X to perform melee attack.
[09:58.73]Melee attacks and dodges consume stamina.
[10:03.97]Okay, here we go.
[10:09.03]You lunge fast forward.
[10:11.27]That's a lot of dashing forward.
[10:13.45]How do you dodge?
[10:15.79]Walk on.
[10:16.62]You just gotta move back and forth real quick.
[10:24.66]It's alright.
[10:31.53]This is a horror movie, that guy.
[10:36.33]Alright.
[10:37.35]What about down here?
[10:37.95]Collectibles?
[10:40.85]Now there's no fucking bobbleheads back here I can pick up.
[10:48.31]Okay.
[10:48.83]Here we go.
[10:50.03]Alright, we got a guy.
[10:52.73]That guy's gonna bow and arrow.
[10:54.88]Just one guy?
[10:57.21]Alright, we're gonna dodge here.
[11:00.55]Oh, you just... I dodged that!
[11:04.10]Come on, man!
[11:09.02]That's a great dodge, though.
[11:10.10]You just kind of flick your chin sideways.
[11:14.56]Anything else?
[11:20.66]No?
[11:20.84]Beast!
[11:21.24]A foul beast!
[11:23.76]You guys diggin' rat!
[11:34.18]I gotta get this dodge down.
[11:36.36]The dodge is weird.
[11:41.84]It's not like a Dark Souls dodge.
[11:49.22]Can I drink their blood?
[11:50.78]No.
[11:53.17]Away!
[11:54.13]Away!
[11:54.61]Are we gonna make Dark Souls?
[12:00.27]No, not that...
[12:01.43]hands up I mean you no harm I I need help die you fucking leech please listen to me I can't make any sense of this shut up beast who are you what is this all about what in god's I'll do the rest of the job just just leave me
[12:32.97]This fucking leech.
[12:35.07]Certain elements like fire will deal aggravated damage that reduces your maximum health gauge.
[12:42.58]So don't stand in the light.
[12:43.52]This guy breathes really heavily.
[12:48.70]Alright, here comes the stealth element.
[12:54.12]No, that's not how you hide.
[12:56.80]You don't scream, let me go.
[12:59.98]Come on, man, really?
[13:00.84]Alright, we're gonna jump this guy.
[13:07.97]Come here!
[13:10.17]Alright, holding B sprints.
[13:17.44]That's a pretty fast sprint, I will say.
[13:19.34]Alright, I found shelter.
[13:22.66]It's at a random house.
[13:24.50]Do I- Yeah, Resident Evil 4 at the door, please.
[13:38.14]Alright, so this is my hub world.
[13:45.69]I get to eventually put furniture in here and level up the house.
[13:48.61]Paint the walls and stuff.
[13:51.65]Ooh, somebody.
[13:52.27]Ooh, that's... that's...
[14:09.35]Also, look at the teeth.
[14:10.75]This lady has cat teeth.
[14:12.03]That's how you know she's a vampire.
[14:13.31]This one's dressed up fancy.
[14:16.05]Let's run through his pockets.
[14:17.56]Oh, God.
[14:18.06]I forgot to change the title.
[14:19.26]Oh, my God.
[14:20.34]I've got to give her that now.
[14:22.04]He's got no more responsibilities.
[14:23.52]The title is... The title was a placeholder joke title.
[14:27.08]It's got to go.
[14:27.58]Beautiful it is.
[14:29.92]We fancy it and share the takings.
[14:33.18]I suppose we are undertakers.
[14:36.44]Now, give him a knee.
[14:41.61]Okay.
[14:42.97]Don't.
[14:44.41]Can I please get rid of the stupid X and then followed by the letter D?
[14:48.65]Please.
[14:51.15]Why do I need to ask permission to do this?
[14:53.65]I can just remove it.
[14:55.57]But please, please, Dad.
[14:57.03]Can I please take off that part of the title, Dad?
[15:00.07]I got one watch.
[15:02.51]Am I asking you guys to take me out to ice cream after dinner or am I running a live stream?
[15:11.90]Watches in this game, whatever.
[15:18.48]I can't see myself, right?
[15:34.17]Fuck this guy.
[15:36.15]I don't want to play with this guy.
[15:37.33]This guy's fucking lagging out the server.
[15:39.35]You got like fucking 700 ping, dude?
[15:40.45]Come on, give me a break.
[15:46.23]Who's there?
[15:47.85]Are you referring to me?
[15:55.72]No!
[15:58.12]No!
[16:00.19]I still have so much to accomplish!
[16:02.31]It's like a bit, and then I bit somebody, and then I took somebody's watch.
[16:07.75]I still have so much left that needs doing.
[16:11.91]You got it.
[16:13.71]So, let's, uh, shillings.
[16:17.03]Five shillings.
[16:18.07]I like that.
[16:21.11]How do I get my maximum health back?
[16:22.45]I like that.
[16:24.43]Okay.
[16:25.93]Do we get to pick up his gun?
[16:38.32]I think he's dead.
[16:46.97]Why is everybody dead?
[16:47.69]I'm sure the story will explain that.
[16:50.23]As we progress.
[16:52.23]Johnny, this one's lost.
[16:53.75]We need to leave.
[16:54.99]And now.
[16:56.19]There's time.
[16:56.80]I can save him.
[17:00.00]That's the enemy coming.
[17:01.80]The orders are to evacuate the hospital.
[17:07.44]Done.
[17:09.26]He'll live.
[17:10.58]And now what?
[17:11.92]We fight.
[17:13.44]Killing is a hell of a lot easier than healing.
[17:18.03]Stole that from the medic.
[17:19.75]What does he say?
[17:22.47]Let's go practice medicine.
[17:23.77]That's pretty much what he said.
[17:25.11]God damn it.
[17:29.07]I can't go, like, one month without making a reference to my favorite video game ever made.
[17:33.33]Alright, use revolver.
[17:34.87]I guess I can look at it like this.
[17:38.81]Here's a map.
[17:39.79]Main quest player position.
[17:41.98]So...
[17:45.77]Mainhand, offhand.
[17:46.87]Okay, so it's fire rate.
[17:49.93]I thought this was a story game.
[17:52.37]This is turning out to be more like a vampire shoot-em-up.
[17:55.48]You know what I mean?
[17:56.22]Like a shmup.
[17:58.14]What is it?
[17:59.56]Shoot-em-up.
[18:01.50]A shmup?
[18:02.28]What do they call them?
[18:04.38]But more importantly... Let me have a second here.
[18:09.35]A while ago, I made a reference to the fact that, if you can notice...
[18:15.26]It's not there anymore.
[18:18.08]Do you see anything there?
[18:20.32]Well, you shouldn't because the television is currently on the ground.
[18:25.50]And I told you guys that I was going to prove to you at some point that this was fucking more than at least a couple hundred pounds.
[18:31.93]So, as you can see, take a look down.
[18:35.21]We got a scale.
[18:35.99]I bought a scale.
[18:38.91]We're going to get the TV onto the scale.
[18:42.60]And you're gonna see just how fucking much this thing weighs.
[18:46.58]You see?
[18:46.96]You understand?
[18:47.52]I'm a man of my word.
[18:51.24]So let me make sure this is in frame.
[18:53.93]Fuck, how you guys gonna see that?
[18:56.99]Okay, I got it.
[18:57.59]I'm gonna take a picture of it with my phone, right?
[19:02.43]Okay, here we go.
[19:05.51]Just to prove that I didn't fuck with the scale.
[19:07.99]Here.
[19:10.66]Here.
[19:14.95]You'll see how much I weigh.
[19:16.03]I thought it was broken.
[19:21.83]Alright, here we go.
[19:24.87]You ready?
[19:26.93]I am 154 pounds.
[19:29.90]Oh, shit.
[19:30.58]I must have lost weight.
[19:31.46]Here we go.
[19:33.22]Hey, take a look.
[19:36.69]I'm not bullshitting.
[19:38.57]This looks like one of those like fat people commercials you see on an ad banner.
[19:42.81]It's like, are you too fat?
[19:45.44]Ready?
[19:46.62]Look.
[19:47.62]See?
[19:47.84]153 pounds.
[19:49.82]You know what I'm talking about?
[19:55.38]What it shows like?
[19:56.58]Are you too fat for the scale?
[19:58.11]Alright, here we go.
[20:01.15]I got to get this TV onto the scale.
[20:06.96]Yeah, two different socks.
[20:08.22]Fuck off.
[20:09.42]Alright, I got it off the tables.
[20:19.19]I didn't think this through.
[20:22.10]Gah!
[20:23.64]Gah!
[20:41.69]It's too big for the scale.
[20:46.58]Oh!
[20:51.30]That's not true.
[20:53.14]It's too big for the scale.
[21:00.05]You see, it's not, I can't get it on the scale correctly.
[21:02.35]Hold on.
[21:05.17]It's 93 pounds.
[21:05.53]It's more than 93 pounds.
[21:12.50]No, I do.
[21:12.92]Okay, so I'm 153, right?
[21:16.33]I gotta hold this while I stand on the scale.
[21:20.09]That's how you weigh your dog.
[21:21.21]You know how you weigh your dog?
[21:22.31]That's how we're gonna do this.
[21:43.17]My arms aren't big enough.
[21:45.20]I got it.
[21:45.54]I got it.
[21:45.81]I got it.
[21:46.09]I got it.
[21:46.35]I got it.
[21:46.79]I got it.
[21:47.29]I got it.
[22:13.56]Alright, I just gotta sit on it.
[22:16.78]As long as I sit on the scale.
[22:22.20]Here we go.
[22:24.98]Okay, I'm on it.
[22:27.40]Alright, just don't move.
[22:37.61]See?
[22:39.61]I told you.
[22:40.07]Oh shit.
[22:43.00]What do I say?
[22:44.14]Quick, take a picture, quick.
[22:46.54]Look at it.
[22:47.96]Oh, fuck.
[22:54.46]How does it know that?
[22:56.62]I was sitting on the scale.
[23:01.12]How would it know that I'm that?
[23:09.51]How would it know that?
[23:15.34]Yeah.
[23:18.26]It said 280 pounds.
[23:19.42]This TV is 100 pounds.
[23:27.28]You see how awkward that is to pick up though?
[23:29.05]I can't like fucking.
[23:34.85]Yeah.
[23:53.06]What do you mean, the audio?
[23:54.20]The audio's desynced?
[23:55.46]How is that possible?
[23:59.63]It shouldn't be.
[24:03.53]Is the audio, the audio's desynced?
[24:08.25]Oh, because I fucking... It's way off.
[24:21.96]Wait, I knocked the audio out of sync.
[24:28.07]Did I actually break my microphone?
[24:34.47]Was it like that before?
[24:40.40]Was it like that before?
[24:50.52]Why would it be out of sync?
[24:51.46]That doesn't make any sense.
[24:56.12]God damn it.
[25:01.67]It's been out of sync for like a half a second.
[25:03.37]Because the last, because of PlayStation 2.
[25:08.74]Whatever.
[25:11.46]It's better now.
[25:16.90]It's alright.
[25:17.40]When you like watch it, just like, just like rip the audio and like put it forward a quarter of a second.
[25:23.32]I got to redo the whole joke now.
[25:24.68]Yeah.
[25:40.22]I thought I was going to die on camera.
[25:43.10]I thought the TV was going to go through my head.
[25:46.55]I thought I was going to get TV'd.
[25:49.69]Well, that would have been my magnum opus.
[25:55.87]That thing, that fucking thing is heavy, man.
[26:02.82]I can't redo the TV.
[26:04.32]I drank like two coffees to be able to attempt to do that.
[26:07.40]And by the way, don't... Hey.
[26:10.02]Don't do that.
[26:10.60]Don't try that at home.
[26:12.32]Don't do that at home.
[26:14.13]Make sure you have proper help picking up large 385 pound TVs.
[26:21.85]Can I see... Let me see how embarrassing that was.
[26:25.49]Let me see.
[26:29.93]My arms aren't big enough.
[26:32.00]I got it.
[26:32.32]I got it.
[26:32.58]I got it.
[26:32.86]I got it.
[26:33.46]I got it.
[26:34.04]I got it.
[26:35.04]Here we go.
[26:36.80]Oh, yeah.
[26:38.44]Yeah, I used to be able to fucking do this shit back in goddamn grade school.
[26:47.41]Oh, that could have gone really badly.
[26:49.94]Oh, that could have gone really bad.
[26:58.90]I can imagine like my face going through it.
[27:01.62]Alright, let's go back to the game.
[27:03.76]You know, let me just give me a second.
[27:06.40]I want to go get a drink.
[27:11.81]I'll be right back.
[27:12.43]Let me just go get some water.
[27:13.87]That was a workout.
[27:15.33]Come on.
[27:21.49]Hey, but in all honesty, though, this thing is fucking at least 200 pounds.
[27:28.78]Trying to get that thing on the scale.
[27:31.46]It didn't fit.
[27:33.42]God, I'm so out of shape.
[27:36.72]Alright.
[27:37.24]Hey, by the way, we got a big donation coming in here.
[27:40.34]A few minutes ago.
[27:40.86]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the 50 bucks.
[27:45.40]Why am I this out of breath?
[27:50.40]I used to lift four days a week at least.
[27:58.45]Thank you for the 50 bucks though, dude.
[28:00.39]Flank Tank.
[28:00.79]Hey, drummer, huge fan.
[28:01.47]Been watching since I was 16.
[28:03.03]I was one of your original 500 subs from that stuttery 240p curling video from like six years ago.
[28:13.84]Looks like you lost some of that muscle.
[28:15.34]Nah, maybe just a little.
[28:17.42]First time giving bits since I'm a broke-ass college kid, but finally got a good comp-sci job.
[28:23.15]So I can give to the best streamer bar none.
[28:25.88]Keep up the great work.
[28:26.68]I'll be with you to the very end.
[28:27.72]P.S.
[28:27.98]Sorry for the other big bit essay like donations coming later.
[28:32.78]You get some big... Listen to me.
[28:35.92]You gotta... You gotta... I lifted a TV once.
[28:40.30]Like 12 minutes ago.
[28:42.56]I need like a two hour break.
[28:45.61]But no, thank you.
[28:46.15]Appreciate that, Flank Tank.
[28:47.75]Thanks for the $50, dude.
[28:49.47]Much love to you.
[28:51.15]And yes, I have gotten a little soft.
[28:54.97]But back to the game.
[28:57.67]You know, the thing that we're supposed to be doing right now.
[29:03.38]Back to the video game.
[29:06.04]Ah, streams, stream cancelled.
[29:10.04]Yeah, streams cancelled.
[29:11.48]I lifted a TV up.
[29:14.72]How's the audio on this, by the way?
[29:15.80]Is it too loud or is it fine?
[29:21.69]Why is it... Get off the screen.
[29:23.45]Why do I have this dumb thing on screen for?
[29:27.40]There we go.
[29:27.84]Okay.
[29:29.76]That's good?
[29:32.78]Okay.
[29:32.96]Oh, we got a note.
[29:36.28]I'm not reading somebody's bloody diary, I'll tell you that.
[29:41.75]It's loud?
[29:43.57]We'll turn it down a little.
[29:44.25]We'll turn the master volume down like one little bit here.
[29:46.81]There we go.
[29:49.65]Okay.
[29:49.75]Okay.
[29:51.76]So, now what?
[29:56.05]Now what?
[29:56.39]After I almost died on stream, what's the next part of the stream?
[29:59.65]Oh yeah, let's just go down here.
[30:00.85]This is locked up, that's locked up, anything else?
[30:09.92]Five shillings.
[30:12.50]Fire and sun.
[30:13.22]New collectibles, see?
[30:13.94]I told you guys there was little bobbleheads.
[30:18.45]Now, I don't have a main quest or anything yet, so...
[30:23.24]The sun is high.
[30:25.06]I cannot leave now.
[30:25.90]I maybe just have to go to bed.
[30:28.64]Do I have to get in a coffin to go to sleep?
[30:37.53]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[30:40.93]Yeah, okay.
[30:47.45]This makes no sense.
[30:49.44]None of it.
[30:51.33]No sense at all.
[30:52.17]How long can a vampire stay out in the sun before he dies?
[30:55.99]It's enlightenment.
[30:59.57]That's it.
[30:59.85]Oh, I forgot about that stupid fucking title.
[31:10.81]I can't alt-tab, though.
[31:11.57]I might crash the game.
[31:16.61]So I got the pinnacle of hydration and nutrition.
[31:21.36]I got a pineapple, mango, orange, apple, beet, lemon, coconut water juice.
[31:25.67]That's right.
[31:26.61]After a long day's... What are you doing?
[31:30.05]It's not going to work.
[31:30.55]It's not made out of wood.
[31:34.81]Those wooden bullets?
[31:35.61]Otherwise, you're going to wake up in about two hours.
[31:37.41]Can I not do it?
[31:51.44]I don't have a... It's not a wooden gun.
[31:53.10]It's not gonna work.
[31:56.72]It's a really short game.
[32:13.31]I told you.
[32:16.85]There has to be wooden bullets.
[32:18.21]And the bullets have to be shaped like little mini crosses.
[32:21.67]Like, imagine, like, a Jesus cereal.
[32:23.55]You know what that would look like?
[32:24.39]And picture that in your head.
[32:25.77]Little mini-crosses made out of whole grain.
[32:30.39]It has to be like that.
[32:38.04]This is absolute madness.
[32:41.12]I've lost touch with the real.
[32:44.29]Madness, indeed.
[32:45.75]As mad as the moon.
[32:47.43]No change, no love, no silence.
[32:54.32]dipped in garlic.
[32:56.44]Well, okay.
[32:57.28]Hideout beds allow you to evolve and rest.
[33:00.24]Spend experience points to level up and improve your vampiric skills.
[33:04.80]Your autobiography.
[33:05.72]Begin by selecting the available skill, Autobiography.
[33:09.04]Okay.
[33:12.30]You drain your own blood to heal normal and aggravated damage instantly.
[33:17.50]Sounds like a pretty bad book.
[33:20.49]Alright, so I have to do this.
[33:22.33]This is the base.
[33:29.25]You drain your own blood.
[33:29.91]Okay, cost 10, recovery 3.
[33:31.05]This is Autophagy 2.
[33:35.21]Alright, I guess we have, this is just teaching us.
[33:39.37]So, a vampire uses the power of his blood to heal normal and aggravated damage, increasing his flesh, nerve, and bone regeneration.
[33:48.67]With time, this vampiric ability can be extremely powerful and is sure to surprise any unwary vampire hunter.
[33:59.20]Oh, okay.
[34:00.18]Don't do that.
[34:02.10]Cool.
[34:10.24]Uh, you have enough XP to unlock an aggressive skill.
[34:13.82]Claws, Blood Spear, or Shadow Mist.
[34:18.48]Alright.
[34:20.14]20 cost, 25, so this is the least expensive.
[34:24.78]This is all close medium range, close medium, this is only close.
[34:29.86]This does the most damage.
[34:31.95]Place a cloud of shadows at the target's feet or yours.
[34:34.75]The cloud will explode after a short time, causing heavy damage.
[34:38.71]You throw a spear made of blood, which should pass through enemies in front of you.
[34:43.23]That sounds pretty cool.
[34:44.05]A claw.
[34:45.59]Cut through all living creatures in front of you.
[34:51.95]I mean, this is pretty basic.
[34:53.89]Blood spear or shadow mist are the ones I'm going to pick here.
[34:57.95]So this is like a mist mine.
[34:59.75]We'll do blood spear.
[35:03.01]That sounds fun.
[35:05.65]Throw a spe- yeah, let's get it.
[35:12.30]2000 and now I can throw a blood spear at people.
[35:15.82]Now select confirm to save your choices.
[35:17.18]Sure thing.
[35:28.97]Good choices.
[35:32.88]We'll see.
[35:38.80]Eternal Thirst.
[35:41.78]Confront the vampire that created me.
[35:46.26]Alright, so.
[35:49.07]Got a compass up there with some meters.
[35:50.63]Eternal Thirst.
[35:51.17]Let me look at the map.
[35:52.13]So it looks like we crossed the bridge.
[35:53.37]Reach North Bank.
[35:56.39]Sounds easy enough.
[35:57.91]Just have to get there.
[36:01.77]I'm just talking in here?
[36:08.49]Oh, shit.
[36:08.73]There are people coming to the house.
[36:14.07]No, no.
[36:14.37]Sorry.
[36:14.53]No, no, no.
[36:14.91]I resonate before the door.
[36:15.93]So I can... I'll be fine.
[36:18.47]Oh, shit.
[36:22.19]These people want me dead.
[36:24.43]I need to leave now.
[36:25.65]Out the back door.
[36:28.06]Let's go.
[36:41.45]Alright, jump up there.
[36:42.31]Go!
[36:42.51]I didn't know I could do that.
[36:45.47]That was cool.
[36:50.24]My head's spinning.
[36:51.54]Blood sphere through the door.
[36:54.12]Skip what?
[36:56.50]I cannot enter.
[36:57.80]Shit, the door's locked.
[37:00.84]Why am I clever?
[37:01.48]I walked in a door and closed it behind me.
[37:05.40]What's that?
[37:07.48]Offhand weapons.
[37:08.07]Offhand weapons can be used by pressing Y. They have attacks with special effects and consume stamina.
[37:14.03]What, do I get a crayon?
[37:14.87]Hold on.
[37:17.75]I can throw a pencil at somebody?
[37:19.81]It's a sharpened pencil.
[37:21.67]Okay, that's funny.
[37:25.69]Wait a minute.
[37:26.23]Did I just get a key?
[37:30.97]Can I open this door?
[37:34.21]No.
[37:34.59]That's dumb.
[37:39.44]No, it's not a stake.
[37:40.38]Let me have this.
[37:41.24]It's a giant novelty pencil that you can get at the funny gift store.
[37:50.31]That door's locked.
[37:53.69]Ow, shit.
[37:57.18]Press Y to use your stake and inflict stun damage.
[37:59.78]A stunned enemy can be bitten.
[38:02.60]Oh, that's okay.
[38:05.75]It's offhand, so you gotta get close.
[38:11.65]Press A to bite a stunned enemy.
[38:13.57]Biting an enemy provides you with blood to use skills and also refills your health gauge.
[38:22.75]Okay.
[38:24.43]Activate blood skills with RB.
[38:26.99]Okay.
[38:28.91]That doesn't give you very much blood.
[38:33.19]You have to fight a bunch of people, huh?
[38:40.24]Are we just in here?
[38:46.04]Okay.
[38:47.52]Now, can I sneak bite blood?
[38:50.40]Let's rephrase that.
[38:51.58]Can I sneak and then bite?
[38:56.94]Oh, what the hell?
[38:57.85]Okay, I guess you can.
[39:01.31]Come here.
[39:04.47]Didn't stun him?
[39:20.50]I'm gonna like die.
[39:22.08]I'm gonna die.
[39:22.74]That's heal, right?
[39:23.22]How does he not see me?
[39:24.14]What's going on?
[39:26.26]Lateral.
[39:28.40]He's gonna shoot.
[39:50.49]You gonna shoot?
[39:51.01]You gonna do it?
[39:53.59]Alright, I understand.
[39:55.31]So the... That bottom meter of theirs... Oh my god!
[40:01.29]Alright, I'm starting to understand how this game even works.
[40:09.92]So they have a certain amount... You have to hit them a certain amount of times, but like, it's not a human anymore.
[40:21.68]It's a lot slower.
[40:23.10]I'm trying to play it like a Bloodborne, but you gotta slow down.
[40:26.78]Slow down.
[40:33.69]Sorry.
[40:34.85]I exaggerated that for no reason.
[40:37.91]Still forgot to take that XD off.
[40:44.21]What is this?
[40:45.61]Join the ranks.
[40:46.48]Your king and country need you.
[40:47.64]Join the... and help...
[40:51.61]join what join the british and help somebody my poor sister if only I had controlled my need for blood this door is locked Mary someone will pay for what happened to you
[41:13.60]Guy on the ground.
[41:14.08]Ooh, stuff.
[41:16.18]Rats?
[41:17.00]You can eat rats, right?
[41:17.92]Yeah, you can.
[41:20.14]Come on, there's another rat right there.
[41:23.92]I can eat both rats.
[41:24.62]Come on.
[41:24.90]Ten bucks.
[41:25.26]Locked door.
[41:25.86]Okay.
[41:26.78]I like that heal.
[41:28.24]Is there a jump?
[41:43.54]Thank God.
[41:43.94]I thought I was going to run right at the edge.
[41:47.39]I think we've got to get a key.
[41:56.81]Almost there.
[41:59.11]20 meters.
[42:04.15]Nothing in there.
[42:07.83]Why would this guy be right here?
[42:09.43]That seems strange.
[42:12.53]What will London have to say to me?
[42:14.51]I have so many questions unanswered.
[42:19.09]London the person or London the city?
[42:22.89]Some people are named London.
[42:26.79]It's the city.
[42:27.83]Jeremy, what are you talking about?
[42:29.01]Direct status stable.
[42:33.42]Limehouse Docks.
[42:36.24]Reach the north bank right down here.
[42:37.70]Alright, let's do it.
[42:42.15]Oh, Jim London.
[42:43.55]Have the very streets of London become a mausoleum?
[42:49.83]London.
[42:56.54]I missed a weapon?
[42:57.32]Shit.
[43:06.34]The man has been drained of all blood.
[43:09.90]But I can still smell the scent of it.
[43:13.62]This would be such a shit life if you had to eat people to stay alive.
[43:17.40]I follow the scent's trail.
[43:20.17]Perhaps it will lead me to my assailant.
[43:22.13]That would be so awful.
[43:26.57]Toggle your vampire senses.
[43:28.09]Fresh blood.
[43:30.69]The smell is so strong.
[43:34.06]Like back here?
[43:37.08]Can't seem to go on the boat.
[43:38.40]What about over here?
[43:43.18]Nine?
[43:43.84]Oh, nine.
[43:54.38]Animal blood?
[43:54.90]Well, that's not how it works, right?
[43:58.32]Doesn't it have to be a human's blood?
[44:03.14]And what about blood types?
[44:05.00]Can you eat... Do you have to eat your same blood type or else it'll get rejected?
[44:13.07]Oh, let's go.
[44:14.73]Oh, let's just... I could just walk up there.
[44:19.10]Well, I'm going to do the thing the game wants me to do so I can teach myself to follow the blood trails.
[44:22.92]Okay, nothing in there.
[44:28.93]And we got blood on this wagon.
[44:31.13]Something glowing.
[44:32.23]That's a fire.
[44:32.99]Okay.
[44:38.93]I've never tried.
[44:41.33]You guys ever tried to drink human blood before?
[44:47.15]Do you eat an animal with a certain blood type?
[44:52.18]No, but that's... God damn it, you got me.
[44:59.64]Yeah, but that's not the same.
[45:02.20]When you drink blood as a vampire...
[45:04.86]Aren't you drinking their soul like you're drinking their life force?
[45:12.05]When you eat an animal, you're not eating their life force.
[45:14.69]Yes, you are.
[45:15.49]No, you're not.
[45:15.93]You're eating muscle tissue, not their soul.
[45:19.47]Vampires convert people into vampires by draining their blood and then filling them with embalming fluid.
[45:24.15]Vampire-specific embalming fluid.
[45:25.71]That's how they turn into a vampire.
[45:27.09]How come when you... Alright, if I bite an animal, if I go bite like a pig's ass right now, is he gonna turn into a fucking Jeremy?
[45:34.70]No.
[45:40.15]Oh, by the way, vampires aren't real, so that's all we need to say.
[45:46.53]Oh, a hideout is available.
[45:48.61]Let's just go.
[45:51.35]I hope not.
[45:53.14]Uh-oh, we got some patrons.
[45:54.22]At last, a little life.
[45:59.48]Whoever he may be, the killer recently entered this bar.
[46:04.18]Unknown, unknown.
[46:05.22]Maybe some of the locals saw him.
[46:06.87]Deserve this.
[46:07.89]What the fuck?
[46:09.15]So I can talk to people?
[46:11.09]I think drink no longer.
[46:12.13]Let's talk to this guy.
[46:13.59]Good evening, sir.
[46:14.43]Can I just eat him?
[46:15.38]I wondered if I could ask for your help.
[46:17.34]Wow.
[46:17.92]You look like you need a drink.
[46:19.44]Yes.
[46:21.54]I apologize for my outfit.
[46:24.15]It's been... It's been a long night.
[46:27.31]Been there, seen that.
[46:29.29]Don't worry.
[46:30.27]Things can only get worse.
[46:32.21]You know what I mean.
[46:33.54]Now, did anyone enter the bar?
[46:35.20]What's going on around here?
[46:36.48]Did anyone enter the bar?
[46:37.42]Has anybody entered the bar recently?
[46:39.90]Can't say.
[46:41.52]Sorry.
[46:42.91]Don't I have to get invited into somebody's house?
[46:45.89]I thought I had to get invited in here.
[46:48.75]So wouldn't I have to stand outside the door and just be like, hey, can I come in?
[46:52.23]Yeah, come on in.
[46:52.81]Okay, thanks.
[46:53.97]Now I can go in their house.
[46:55.37]Isn't that how it works?
[47:11.20]what's going on around here it's like everybody is hiding this isn't a house you must be new here have you not heard about the murders everybody fears to return to the sewer dog public yeah but how how does my vampire dna differentiate this house is a business and this house is a person's house no it's a building with a door on it and I what what's the difference
[47:38.89]Uh, who's the sewer dog?
[47:39.81]Who is the sewer dog?
[47:41.25]It's a local bogeyman.
[47:43.00]Convenient answer for every crime that happened for decades.
[47:47.08]You murdered someone, blamed a sewer dog, eh?
[47:49.94]Okay.
[47:52.26]You make it sound like it's a fairy tale.
[47:55.37]People will always believe in monsters.
[47:56.81]The building has a blood type.
[47:58.63]It's easier than accepting their own darkness.
[48:02.18]We can all be monsters.
[48:03.64]Am I drunk?
[48:05.22]No, I am not.
[48:06.86]Not in the slightest.
[48:08.44]I'll leave you to your bottle then.
[48:10.46]I should just run as far away from this place as I can.
[48:13.12]What about you?
[48:16.40]Do vampires hydrate?
[48:18.38]Do they just only drink blood?
[48:20.10]Do they eat food?
[48:21.22]Do they drink water?
[48:22.82]I'm looking for someone who might have passed through here recently.
[48:43.74]What does vampire shit look like?
[48:44.54]No, they don't shit.
[48:45.14]They just pee out blood.
[48:47.04]If all you take in for sustenance is liquid blood, you're going to pee blood.
[48:50.55]It's not even going to get digested.
[49:13.31]Well, some of it will get digested.
[49:14.69]The other parts of it is going to come out red.
[49:20.37]I need to meet this man.
[49:22.47]I have questions.
[49:24.27]Just climb the stairs and knock on the first door.
[49:26.55]I heard him open his window, so I guess he's still awake.
[49:30.05]And, sir.
[49:30.89]Yes?
[49:31.33]No funny business.
[49:32.89]You hear me?
[49:34.07]This is a respectable establishment.
[49:36.47]Okay.
[49:38.29]I'll confront the man on the second floor of the turquoise turtle.
[49:43.92]Who else can I get to know here?
[49:46.85]This is Tom Watts and his friend Dyson Delaney.
[49:54.71]He's fatigued.
[49:55.41]I don't want his blood.
[49:57.07]This guy, on the other hand, he's got some high-quality blood in him.
[50:02.47]We've got to get everybody's blood details, so I'm going to talk to everybody.
[50:05.94]I don't know.
[50:11.32]Maybe you could just talk to me.
[50:13.12]Maybe you'd prefer to speak with Tom, then.
[50:16.26]He's more agreeable talking to strangers.
[50:19.84]When was the last time you had an orange?
[50:22.44]And an avocado?
[50:25.74]I need to know.
[50:27.08]What is this place?
[50:28.30]This is Tom's bar.
[50:29.72]A turquoise turtle.
[50:31.56]I'm the barmaid here, Sabrina.
[50:33.31]If you want to know.
[50:36.33]always are you always open this late at night no it's only since the epidemic started bite Tom thought that people may need a safe place to stay where the is everybody you don't seem to have much business where is everybody most people are sleeping right now and those that are awake voice crack voice crack I have voice crack with the murders and all
[51:00.31]I'm fucking eight years old, I swear to God.
[51:03.65]I just want to talk.
[51:04.67]I just want to talk.
[51:06.27]I didn't mean to scare you.
[51:07.65]I'm not afraid, sir.
[51:09.75]It's just I've other customers to take care of.
[51:11.95]I only see one customer.
[51:13.91]Oh.
[51:13.97]Well, yeah, of course.
[51:16.73]I mean, I best check on them.
[51:21.21]I'll leave then.
[51:22.33]Thank you.
[51:23.41]I was able to smell her enough to find out that she has healthy blood.
[51:27.49]She's got 1500 XP of blood.
[51:29.35]And how do I eat her?
[51:32.16]How do I eat this guy?
[51:32.88]Can I eat him?
[51:35.12]Can I slaughter the whole inn and eat them all?
[51:37.94]Maybe.
[51:42.14]You just have to stand around and listen to them talk and smell them for enough time.
[51:45.04]And then you can find out if they're healthy or not.
[51:47.45]They do not pursue me.
[51:49.49]But they're looking for vampires.
[51:51.07]And they're most efficient.
[51:52.64]They'll not relent until the killer has been identified.
[51:55.22]This guy's a fucking creep.
[51:56.12]I have a common objective, but I require... Not me, this guy is.
[51:59.71]I think someone is eavesdropping.
[52:01.25]How would you know that?
[52:03.73]How would you know that?
[52:05.07]You might as well come in, whoever you are.
[52:07.33]See, I just got invited in.
[52:08.57]Let's go.
[52:09.17]Come on in.
[52:10.05]Thank you for inviting me into your house, because this is technically a hotel.
[52:12.89]Vampire, who are you?
[52:14.71]God damn it, he's got the fucking cereal.
[52:16.32]I mean you no harm.
[52:17.62]Say it's a vampire.
[52:18.68]Present yourself.
[52:23.10]Wait a minute.
[52:32.75]It's just a Christmas decoration.
[52:34.23]You can run at him.
[52:35.19]It's not real.
[52:38.07]He got that at Target for eight bucks.
[52:39.59]That's nice.
[52:44.07]Okay.
[52:44.93]I'll talk to him.
[52:56.98]Am I gonna get psychologically interviewed here?
[53:03.26]Why did that glow?
[53:04.05]Doesn't make any sense.
[53:06.87]Unknown.
[53:07.25]And who might you be?
[53:08.71]Okay, I gotta figure out who this guy is.
[53:11.17]I don't know.
[53:11.77]I won't tell you first.
[53:13.25]Tell me.
[53:14.59]Who are you?
[53:16.61]First, tell me what you want.
[53:19.48]Then I may tell you.
[53:21.51]No.
[53:21.69]That's none of your concern.
[53:22.91]You tell me.
[53:24.23]Sir, you have entered my room in the middle of the night, pale as a corpse and shaking like a tree.
[53:30.65]So please, indulge me.
[53:33.65]Something, someone is molesting people.
[53:38.19]In fact, killing them, biting them.
[53:42.49]The calling card of a vampire.
[53:44.47]Did he just do the make like a tree thing?
[53:47.19]Isn't that not real?
[53:49.35]Okay, I'm a victim.
[53:50.55]You seem like an expert.
[53:51.45]This is not real.
[53:52.65]I'm a victim too.
[53:53.51]You see, I remember being bit.
[53:55.03]I've been hunted down in the streets and attacked.
[53:58.31]I'm a victim here too.
[54:01.91]I believe you.
[54:03.57]Then if you are not a vampire, who or what are you?
[54:07.74]Dr. Edgar Swansea of the Brotherhood of St.
[54:09.88]Paul.
[54:11.06]I'm performing an independent investigation here in an attempt to understand precisely what is going on.
[54:19.42]Help me.
[54:20.74]What do you know?
[54:21.30]Who are you talking to?
[54:22.55]What is this brotherhood?
[54:23.67]Help.
[54:24.01]Just going to go right to the point.
[54:25.49]Then help me find the culprit.
[54:28.17]I may.
[54:29.35]If you'll first tell me why you opened this door.
[54:33.01]I followed a trail.
[54:34.84]The scent of blood from a recent victim.
[54:37.38]It led me here.
[54:39.48]You thought I was your aggressor.
[54:42.04]That explains a great deal.
[54:44.22]We are both chasing the same shadow.
[54:47.81]Okay.
[54:49.26]Yes.
[54:50.24]No.
[54:51.14]I'm not sure.
[54:51.70]Well, yes is... We're both chasing the same person.
[54:58.70]I'm gonna say yes.
[55:00.28]I trust this guy.
[55:04.14]A shadow, indeed.
[55:07.06]Yet I heard his voice in my head.
[55:08.68]There was a moment I believed I was mad.
[55:12.88]Okay, bye.
[55:13.56]Thanks for the time.
[55:15.02]See you later.
[55:15.72]I'm gonna go home and go to bed.
[55:17.60]Thanks for your time.
[55:19.48]I'll end him.
[55:20.32]I don't know.
[55:20.62]I'll demand answers.
[55:36.59]It might be him.
[55:37.87]So, I'm gonna say... I'm gonna demand answers.
[55:39.89]Turn... Throwknife into neck.
[55:41.07]Holy shit, he's got 6,000 experience points of blood.
[56:09.05]Holy shit.
[56:11.09]Hint locked.
[56:12.53]The blood quality of the citizens is largely limited by their health and number of hints you gathered before embracing them.
[56:19.03]So you get blood hints.
[56:23.32]Healthy, stable, critical.
[56:25.90]This is kind of cool.
[56:31.66]I mean, can I eat them?
[56:34.60]I don't think I can.
[56:35.19]Can I have some privacy, please?
[56:39.93]Well.
[56:41.63]Healthy blood.
[56:43.04]6,000 blood echoes.
[56:43.62]Yeah, that's awesome.
[56:45.06]Is he going to be mad about me taking his stuff?
[56:46.82]No.
[56:48.10]That doesn't exist in this game.
[56:49.14]Interrogate the locals.
[56:51.46]Any more drawers I can open?
[56:55.35]No.
[56:55.63]Let's interrogate the people downstairs.
[56:58.66]If Swansea is not my attacker, it means somebody else came here tonight.
[57:04.06]Uh, you.
[57:04.52]Someone must know something.
[57:06.69]I need a word with you.
[57:07.99]Can I help you?
[57:08.73]I have a few questions for you.
[57:11.27]Well, if you must.
[57:13.67]I want the truth.
[57:14.55]I want the truth.
[57:15.49]I spoke to Dr. Swansea.
[57:17.22]He's not the man I'm looking for.
[57:19.22]Now, I want the truth.
[57:20.42]The truth?
[57:21.72]What do you mean?
[57:22.46]I suspect that someone else was here tonight.
[57:25.22]And I don't think Tom wants to tell me about it.
[57:27.84]I'm just the barmaid here, okay?
[57:29.18]Kill him now?
[57:30.01]If Tom says you're the only visitor we had, then you're the only visitor we had.
[57:33.85]I can feel your fear, madam.
[57:36.51]Please, tell me what's going on.
[57:38.03]I need to run his blood through a machine and find out what he ate for dinner last night.
[57:41.01]William Bishop?
[57:43.05]He came in here earlier tonight and he... Well, I thought he was gonna clock someone.
[57:49.11]Interesting, okay.
[57:51.43]Tell me about this William Bishop.
[57:53.23]Will was a sailor who worked at the cannon factory before he lost that job.
[57:58.02]A nice bloke, really.
[58:00.16]He's never been violent.
[58:01.16]Kill somebody already.
[58:02.40]Until tonight.
[58:03.24]Why keep it a secret?
[58:04.52]I'm not going to kill somebody yet.
[58:05.58]Why not tell me about it?
[58:06.70]Tom's nothing if not loyal.
[58:09.07]After Will lost his job, he offered him one ear.
[58:12.01]They used to be good mates.
[58:14.27]But recently, Will...
[58:17.05]We all started to get very aggressive.
[58:19.71]I see.
[58:20.23]When do you do vampire stuff?
[58:21.57]Thank you for your candor.
[58:23.27]I'll be sure to talk to Tom.
[58:25.91]Okay.
[58:26.78]Citizen hints.
[58:27.40]You just discovered a hint.
[58:28.62]It reveals a secret about a citizen or someone related to them.
[58:34.74]Okay.
[58:36.24]As a vampire, you need human blood to evolve.
[58:38.28]The blood quality bar indicates the XP you will earn if you feed on this citizen.
[58:42.89]Unlocked hints increase the amount of XP.
[58:48.16]Okay.
[58:48.94]So Tom and William Bichette used to be good friends.
[58:52.56]So I need to learn a shitload about them and then eat them.
[58:57.38]Okay.
[59:00.21]2700 XP.
[59:03.45]Who the fuck is this guy?
[59:04.33]Oh, that's the guy in the bar.
[59:06.03]Okay.
[59:07.81]Let's keep it going then, let's talk about you.
[59:09.77]They just all snitch on each other and then you drink them?
[59:12.69]You got another for me?
[59:14.20]Alright, what about you?
[59:16.58]I just learned some stuff about you.
[59:18.24]Hey, I told you, you were the only other stranger I've had.
[59:34.98]Force a citizen to reveal information thanks to a hint you have discovered.
[59:37.94]Blue prompt.
[59:39.90]Tom, talk to me about the visit from your old friend, William.
[59:43.64]Yes, Will came by tonight, but he's not my friend anymore.
[59:48.10]So you can, uh, you can Kelevrimbor people in this game and you actually sound like Kelevrimbor.
[59:53.94]I need to find him.
[59:55.88]It's a matter of urgency.
[59:58.28]Do you know where he is?
[59:59.38]He could try his boat.
[60:01.40]It's up by the North Pier.
[60:03.04]He sleeps there when he's too drunk to get home.
[60:05.08]Please describe him to me.
[60:06.80]What'd you expect?
[60:08.20]He's a tall, sick bastard with a bad rash and torn old clothes.
[60:13.41]William used to be strong.
[60:15.01]Now he's a mess.
[60:16.11]Thank you, Todd.
[60:16.97]If you see him, tell him I don't want him back here unless he cleans up his act, okay?
[60:20.87]Okay.
[60:24.73]Now go inspect the boats.
[60:26.86]So the boats, let's take a look at our mini-map.
[60:30.00]Alright.
[60:33.22]Rest to evolve.
[60:34.02]I don't have enough points, so... I don't think I do at least.
[60:36.80]Alright, let's see.
[60:37.24]We gotta go over here.
[60:39.24]Inspect the boats.
[60:43.31]quest knight is here again attract the killer inspect the boat let's go I'm assuming we can go this way maybe not I will get to the bottom of this intrigue what's been done to me I might just insta drink William if it's possible because I kind of want some blood points
[61:12.63]We got a boat over here.
[61:15.15]Nothing in that boat.
[61:16.99]Nothing in that boat.
[61:19.47]That boat's got a guy in it, but I don't know.
[61:20.97]Is that William?
[61:21.47]Examine outfit.
[61:23.91]Pick up the note.
[61:24.79]Let's pick up the note.
[61:27.08]Let's see what it says.
[61:27.86]Prywooden.
[61:30.26]Prywooden orders.
[61:42.23]This man was armed.
[61:44.07]He tried to defend himself.
[61:46.90]I don't think this is not William.
[61:48.28]This corpse has been dried of its blood, just like the previous victim.
[61:55.18]Blood and empty gin bottles.
[61:58.60]This bishop is something of a heavy drinker.
[62:01.07]Why did I just read that?
[62:03.93]There are blood splats on the other side of the canal.
[62:06.61]I must reach that barge.
[62:10.76]Alright.
[62:11.58]Reach the barge.
[62:14.70]Anything else I can do over here besides teleport?
[62:16.98]Nope.
[62:22.33]Ooh, hunter.
[62:23.53]Resistances.
[62:24.13]Okay, there's a hunter in here.
[62:27.29]I just smelled him.
[62:33.30]Hunter.
[62:34.32]Hunter.
[62:34.78]Alright.
[62:37.62]out of combat silently silently out of combat a silently odd that's odd that there's no sneak button because I feel like I just shouldn't be able to do this one two three whoa frame rate what are you doing blood blood is something what's in this box
[63:06.91]Okay, we've got bullets.
[63:08.57]Equip and press Y to use your ranged weapons and inflict both standard damage and stun damage.
[63:12.75]Be aware that your ammo is unlimited.
[63:14.09]Enemy card.
[63:15.81]Press L to spot enemies around and display their enemy cards.
[63:30.59]Okay, this is going to explain this.
[63:32.47]Some enemies are more resistant to certain types of damage.
[63:34.41]There are four types of resistances.
[63:36.89]Physical melee and ranged.
[63:39.99]Blood powers and shadow powers.
[63:42.21]Orange indicates a medium resistance and red indicates a high resistance.
[63:48.19]Okay.
[63:50.97]So this guy is resistant to melee.
[63:53.03]I can kill this guy.
[63:57.01]Could go up there, but, you know, let's try to hone our combat skills, what do you say?
[64:00.91]Come here!
[64:01.61]Ow.
[64:01.67]Ow!
[64:01.77]Lock onto him!

[64:02.69]That was cool.
[64:03.95]Common handle part.
[64:28.91]How do I equip?
[64:31.31]How do I do that?
[64:31.79]I want to put on the... Where's my body?

[64:54.35]So I would like to change the UI by 10.
[64:58.55]I want to put it on my... I didn't really pay attention.
[65:03.53]I'm not sure I could have paid attention.
[65:04.73]How do you switch out weapons?
[65:09.72]What else we got here?
[65:10.40]Alright.
[65:11.04]We got a gunner over here.
[65:19.53]This game's kind of fun
[65:42.18]I could see playing this for a little while and maybe getting sick of it after like four hours.
[65:48.10]I don't know.
[65:48.62]We'll find out.
[65:49.22]Alright, follow the blood trail.
[65:52.86]Which I seem to have lost.
[65:53.84]There it is.
[65:59.56]I mean... If the game keeps developing... It's fun.
[66:07.48]I'm having a good time.
[66:08.20]Who's that?
[66:09.14]Unknown.
[66:09.52]Can I yell at him?
[66:12.41]Rats are often located near hideouts.
[66:14.05]Using senses will help you locate more of them easily.
[66:17.03]Rats.
[66:20.31]Rats are located near hideouts.
[66:23.60]Okay, so there they are.
[66:29.12]So there's a hideout over here somewhere.
[66:32.36]So whereabouts is this hideout?
[66:37.50]Can I climb the pole?
[66:40.06]Or is it just inside that house?
[66:44.45]Can I break this?
[66:47.35]I got full blood.
[66:49.51]Another box to open.
[66:57.58]Ooh, I got a new gun.
[66:58.36]Okay.
[66:59.00]Used Lupara.
[67:01.28]160 damage.
[67:02.82]Common Lupara.
[67:06.40]Leveling.
[67:07.08]What the fuck does this mean?
[67:11.29]Firearms.
[67:12.02]Details.
[67:12.62]I can level that shit up.
[67:17.00]Apparently.
[67:19.20]Where's this guy?
[67:19.72]There's a guy up here yelling at me.
[67:21.22]Oh, he's over here.
[67:21.70]Okay.
[67:22.78]He's resistant to melee.
[67:29.87]I should have ate that guy, but whatever.
[67:31.19]Alright, let's get back down.
[67:33.93]I am morally opposed to rat murder.
[67:42.56]I'm not murdering them.
[67:44.08]Well, I am killing them, but I'm killing them to eat them.
[67:48.04]Not just killing them for fun.
[67:53.34]Nothing I can do over there.
[67:55.93]No.
[67:56.59]Let's just keep going.
[68:00.63]Up there!
[68:02.39]Hey!
[68:04.05]I found a blinking hideout.
[68:05.89]You found a new hideout!
[68:06.77]You can spend your XP while resting and craft items at the workbench.
[68:11.51]Why don't we do that?
[68:12.95]What's this?
[68:13.69]Money?
[68:16.67]Refill all.
[68:18.93]Interesting.
[68:20.70]That looks like a workbench, but apparently not.
[68:22.22]Come on, bat boy.
[68:25.36]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[68:27.58]Common handle park.
[68:28.58]You can craft weapons.
[68:33.76]On a workbench, you can craft medical treatments to heal sick citizens, serums to boost yourself, weapon upgrades to improve and customize your weapons.
[68:42.28]Alright.
[68:44.62]If you have enough components to improve one of your weapons, you can do weapon upgrades.
[68:49.08]Press RT.
[68:51.36]Select a melee weapon to upgrade.
[68:54.82]Stake, probably should just do the main hand here.
[68:59.37]You can upgrade your weapon to a new level with the required ingredients.
[69:02.45]It will inflict more damage and you will also gain access to customization slots.
[69:08.87]Level two.
[69:10.09]This goes from 45 to 58.
[69:14.25]do it.
[69:14.57]Why not?
[69:16.19]Which then that unlocks this.
[69:19.21]Enhanced damage.
[69:21.75]Or stamina consumption reduction.
[69:24.45]Okay.
[69:24.88]Alright.
[69:25.14]That's cool.
[69:26.94]Alright.
[69:27.74]What about this?
[69:28.16]Can I upgrade this?
[69:29.64]No.
[69:29.92]Not in the fucking tiny common handle parts.
[69:32.96]Firearms?
[69:33.82]Level 2?
[69:34.04]Nope.
[69:37.60]Offhanded firearm.
[69:38.32]I really need to figure out how to fucking equip this shit.
[69:42.31]What does this game want to be?
[69:45.10]That is a good question.
[69:46.56]I feel like it has no idea.
[69:51.75]But it is... It's fairly enjoyable.
[69:54.17]I don't hate this game.
[69:56.25]It's catching my attention for at least a little while.
[69:59.01]Alright, I need to do some... Big Thirst.
[70:04.49]Increases your blood absorption while biting in combat.
[70:08.39]Increases my total blood capacity.
[70:13.49]Increases my stamina.
[70:14.45]I like that.
[70:14.93]Increases your health.
[70:16.67]Yeah.
[70:18.41]Life regeneration when biting.
[70:20.25]Hard biting.
[70:23.23]There's ultimates in this game?
[70:24.38]Oh dear.
[70:25.46]These are all locked.
[70:26.08]Alright.
[70:26.68]I could do another blood spirit.
[70:28.12]No, let's get... Let's get more stamina.
[70:30.98]Or more health.
[70:31.94]I can do them both.
[70:38.08]Could actually do it twice.
[70:40.42]No, let's play it safe here.
[70:42.34]Health and stamina.
[70:51.91]Yeah.
[70:52.97]That's good for now.
[70:57.87]It's just a MOBA.
[70:58.71]Yeah, you can just press 4.
[71:00.05]And you spin around and you take out shotguns and you fire.
[71:06.42]District status is stable.
[71:09.94]More blood.
[71:10.44]Okay, apparently it's stay close, keep an eye on each other.
[71:16.60]More hunters out here, it assumes.
[71:22.28]It assumes.
[71:25.12]Let's go.
[71:27.44]Sprint to the next level.
[71:32.10]This way, that way, that way's locked.
[71:36.84]Fresh blood.
[71:38.68]The whole building reeks of it.
[71:41.22]The scent is so strong it makes me dizzy.
[71:43.62]Lead rod.
[71:44.50]I really want to fucking change that.
[71:51.33]There's got to be a way.
[71:52.37]I must be missing something as to how to switch out those weapons.
[71:55.33]I want to put the gun on.
[71:59.66]Alright, here we go.
[72:00.74]Character.
[72:03.06]Offhand.
[72:05.08]Let's get the... This one.
[72:09.38]Okay, that's on there.
[72:10.54]Equipping with a two-handed weapon will unequip your offhand weapon.
[72:12.93]That's fine.
[72:15.39]So now I can go between the two.
[72:16.53]Here we go.
[72:16.93]Alright.
[72:17.35]I wanted to see what this was like.
[72:24.56]Two guys over there.
[72:27.56]Have them skeletons.
[72:29.72]Alright.
[72:33.73]Used scythe.
[72:35.55]Equip a two-handed weapon and press Y to use its special ability.
[72:39.77]The scythe can be used to parry an incoming attack, inflicting heavy stun damage if timed correctly.
[72:47.50]Really are trickling in quite a few things here.
[72:51.76]Alright, can I do... Can I put them both on?
[72:57.38]Alright, so I can only... Let's try it.
[73:00.27]Let's test out the new melee weapon.
[73:02.73]Melee.
[73:04.11]Confront William Bishop.
[73:19.02]Well, where are you?
[73:21.90]Oh, there he is.
[73:24.42]Whoa, whoa.
[73:27.22]We got a first boss?
[73:28.41]Wilhelm Bishop?
[73:31.21]I didn't even get a look at his stats.
[73:35.55]Ooh, getting fucking blocked.
[73:40.89]He's blocking right now?
[73:41.99]Alright.
[73:43.06]Ooh, good parry.
[73:44.08]Good parry, Wil.
[73:45.62]Good parry, Bill Clinton Bishop.
[73:53.51]How about blood attack?
[73:54.79]Oh, you don't like that, do you?
[73:56.89]Let's parry it again.
[74:01.31]Do I eat him?
[74:06.33]This is, like, gonna be gross blood, right?
[74:08.85]Apparently not.
[74:13.78]Ow.
[74:15.86]Oh, shit.
[74:17.28]And...
[74:23.34]He's dead.
[74:25.20]Let's check his pulse.
[74:28.97]No, check on the victim.
[74:32.37]Unknown.
[74:32.93]Alright, let's find out what he knows after that.
[74:36.73]Good fucking boss fight.
[74:37.55]I just beat that guy.
[74:38.52]He was so hard.
[74:38.88]I like to hear this one.
[74:49.46]I'm a doctor.
[74:50.44]You're suffering from shock.
[74:52.22]I must return to my flock to stray without me.
[74:59.93]Got him with a two by four.
[75:01.01]Nice work.
[75:02.91]Remember, certain Scals are every bit as resistant as we are.
[75:06.45]Who are you?
[75:08.13]What do you mean by Scal?
[75:10.42]You truly are a newborn.
[75:12.84]I should have realized.
[75:13.88]Wait.
[75:15.36]You are the woman from the bar.
[75:18.14]She is?
[75:18.50]That's the same lady.
[75:28.13]Oh, she's dead.
[75:30.19]She just fucking imploded.
[75:31.23]Oh, there he is.
[75:46.33]Patience, good fellows.
[75:47.94]I've come to offer help.
[75:50.72]Just give me a moment to secure my boat.
[75:53.06]We can leave this awful place.
[75:57.12]William was not the evil man they claimed.
[75:59.14]He was just taken by the tourist.
[76:00.94]He needed his drink.
[76:02.08]This man requires medical attention.
[76:04.06]We'll see he gets to the nearest hospital.
[76:06.12]No, please.
[76:06.96]I almost tend to my fault.
[76:08.20]My flock needs me.
[76:10.12]Go with the good Dr. Swansea.
[76:11.48]He's resourceful, and I'm sure he'll take good care of you.
[76:14.80]You'd best come as well.
[76:16.27]The sun is soon to rise and you'll need a place to rest.
[76:19.81]I just need a moment.
[76:21.97]If I can learn something about what has happened to William, I'll be a step closer to understanding what happened to me.
[76:27.19]I'm gonna investigate William.
[76:30.80]I'm gonna smell his blood for a few minutes.
[76:32.28]I'm just gonna lean in and just, like, smell him.
[76:35.12]Alright, gather a blood sample.
[76:36.46]This poor creature can't be my maker.
[76:40.55]See, there it is.
[76:41.79]A fresh sample of William Bishop's blood in a small tube.
[76:44.15]Am I going to wear this around my neck?
[76:45.24]Could it be some subspecies of vampire?
[76:49.36]I must find a place to analyze the blood.
[76:51.52]Didn't Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt do that or something where they wore blood necklaces of each other?
[77:04.24]I would be so afraid that that would pop open or break at the grocery store or something.
[77:08.86]Imagine that.
[77:09.22]Imagine, like, down the soup aisle and it falls off your neck or something and it shatters on the ground.
[77:14.80]You get blood all over food and stuff.
[77:16.34]All of a sudden, you're going to jail.
[77:17.18]You know what I mean?
[77:24.73]I'm obsessed with celebrities.
[77:25.93]What do you mean I'm obsessed with celebrities?
[77:27.41]Where are we headed?
[77:28.91]We're on our way to the Pembroke Hospital.
[77:30.75]It's just across the canal.
[77:32.35]They'll have a bed for poor Mr. Hampton.
[77:35.14]William was... What manner of creature was he?
[77:39.62]Predator, prey, villain and victim.
[77:42.20]It was Billy Bob Thornton.
[77:43.20]Yeah, that's who it was.
[77:45.15]The important thing is that he's been stopped.
[77:47.33]Duly noted.
[77:48.07]And the woman?
[77:50.25]What?
[77:51.25]Who is she?
[77:52.40]What woman?
[77:53.60]Don't play me for a fool.
[77:55.32]You used me to locate that skull.
[77:57.78]You must know who she is.
[77:59.71]Going to jail for bleeding in a store.
[78:02.15]No, there's a difference between... I keep blood on me in a little glass vial at all times.
[78:11.74]That's criminal negligence.
[78:14.04]You're at the salmon section.
[78:16.70]You're at the butcher and you sneeze and the blood comes up and shatters into the glass.
[78:21.98]That's criminal negligence.
[78:22.80]You got blood all over the food.
[78:24.93]You can't sell that.
[78:25.51]The flu has decimated the East End and the war still rages.
[78:28.77]Welcome to the front lines of a plague.
[78:31.27]This is where you work, Dr. Swansea.
[78:33.17]I am the administrator of Pembroke Hospital.
[78:35.63]I thought you were here in service of your mysterious order, the Brotherhood of... Of St.
[78:39.21]Paul's Stone.
[78:40.17]Yes.
[78:40.55]First and foremost, I'm a man of science.
[78:44.14]A physician, like yourself, Dr. Reed.
[78:47.50]How do you know who I am?
[78:49.00]No need for modesty.
[78:50.96]You are Dr. Jonathan Reed, a surgeon of some caliber and renown, if I'm not mistaken.
[78:57.70]I knew it.
[78:59.78]I had my suspicions.
[79:02.46]But when you took the blood sample from the corpse of poor William, I was certain.
[79:10.96]Dr. Reed.
[79:12.86]Marvelous.
[79:15.45]Alright, I thought he was dead.
[79:16.59]Game's too loud.
[79:32.34]Word, again, from a so-called man of science.
[79:36.14]I broke my microphone with my TV.
[79:40.38]When myth walks among us, the Brotherhood of St.
[79:43.34]Paul has dedicated its purpose to their study.
[79:46.26]Oh, yeah, sorry, I can't do that.
[79:48.30]I broke my microphone with my TV.
[79:51.14]How did you, what?
[79:53.72]Well, then let me be blunt.
[79:57.71]Join my staff at Pembroke Hospital.
[79:59.89]First choice of the game.
[80:01.19]As a physician.
[80:03.47]I suspect you'll not find a better post of employment to contemplate your predicament.
[80:10.02]This is sudden.
[80:12.14]I was returning home to see my sickly mother.
[80:16.07]But alas, that was before contracting this...
[80:20.19]Affliction.
[80:21.80]Dr. Reed.
[80:23.60]Take a moment to consider.
[80:26.00]The post would be for the night shift, providing a good explanation for your absence during daylight hours.
[80:31.44]You'll be adequately reimbursed and have a place to hide.
[80:37.19]I even had the forethought to bring some clean clothes.
[80:41.93]So, what do you say?
[80:46.37]Alright, what's my choice here?
[80:47.51]It seems I have little choice, but yours is a generous offer, so I thank you.
[80:51.67]Brilliant!
[80:52.78]Oh, Jonathan, this is one for the book.
[80:55.44]The beginning of a beautiful friendship.
[80:59.33]So, um, anyways, I had a dream recently that I was at the buffet, or it doesn't matter, it's an undetermined place where they had the sneeze garden, a bunch of food, a bunch of people around picking up with tongs, and I sneezed into the food.
[81:16.62]A big salad, a couple of chicken wing containers, I sneezed right into it, and the whole place stopped.
[81:23.20]And inside my brain, I was having this internal conflict, where I was like, I gotta find somebody.
[81:29.54]I gotta find a fucking worker here.
[81:32.04]So I went to go grab a worker, and I was telling the worker, listen, I'm really sorry.
[81:38.23]Come with me.
[81:38.87]I sneezed in the fucking food.
[81:40.23]I'm gonna have to pay for it all.
[81:41.63]I don't know what to do.
[81:42.37]And while I was saying that, another person, as we were walking over, sneezed into the food.
[81:48.83]So I, like an asshole, was like, oh, he just... I kind of caught myself after starting to tell him about the sneezing.
[81:59.18]And I blamed it on that guy, and that guy had to pay for it.
[82:03.47]And I remember I felt so bad and I was so scared.
[82:06.51]There were cameras everywhere.
[82:08.75]There are cameras in every corner.
[82:10.13]I just, this guy's going to get in trouble.
[82:11.80]And he got, like, the book thrown at him.
[82:14.88]And the dream progressed where, like, days later potentially passed.
[82:18.50]And I was waking up every morning thinking the police were going to be at my door.
[82:21.78]Because I blamed the sneeze thing on another guy.
[82:24.38]Even though I did it too.
[82:25.24]It's only thanks to Nurse Crane and the staff that our ship doesn't sink.
[82:29.85]If you have any questions, just ask her.
[82:32.27]He was executed.
[82:33.85]Thank you.
[82:34.19]Your assistance is required, Dr. Swansea.
[82:36.13]Immediately.
[82:36.91]Dude, I got, by the way, talking about stupid dreams.
[82:39.55]Coming, Nurse Crane.
[82:40.97]I'm coming.
[82:42.07]I think I may have talked about this before.
[82:43.35]We probably brought it up before.
[82:44.49]But I have dreams that I'm still late for class in high school.
[82:48.95]I wake up in the middle of... I wake up, I'm groggy, and I'm like, Oh, no.
[82:54.11]I'm going to fail that class.
[82:56.63]My math class.
[82:57.75]I'm going to fail it, dude.
[83:00.69]It's like I haven't been in high school in like 15 years.
[83:06.85]Into the hospital.
[83:10.39]We'll have a word in my office later, Jonathan.
[83:13.71]Eat them all.
[83:14.41]One, two, three.
[83:15.09]Suck it all.
[83:18.17]I don't think you can.
[83:21.72]Very healthy.
[83:22.52]Sean Hampton.
[83:24.14]And the other two are unknown.
[83:24.96]Alright, enter the hospital.
[83:25.88]Let's... But they're currently blocking the path, so let's go over here.
[83:32.43]Alright, here we go.
[83:41.74]It's Bill again.
[83:42.64]Bill's alive!
[83:45.10]William Bishop is still alive.
[83:47.92]He keeps coming back to life and eating people.
[83:55.95]Oh no, never mind.
[83:56.87]I saw the white, like the grey hair.
[84:01.95]Come on, you bastard.
[84:03.95]I won't bite.
[84:05.21]Sir, please.
[84:06.75]You've lost too much blood.
[84:08.73]Calm yourself.
[84:10.73]You think I didn't notice?
[84:12.03]Why is this guy dressed like a flight attendant?
[84:13.47]Stop your staring and get me to an hospital, you arse.
[84:22.76]Insult me again and I'll put an end to your misery right now.
[84:27.08]Alright, alright.
[84:28.38]Sorry.
[84:29.58]I am in pain here.
[84:31.66]A sailor, you mean?
[84:32.46]I have a doctor.
[84:32.90]Come with me with my blood-o-vision goggles.
[84:35.29]That means you have a chance to eat him.
[84:37.39]Double meeting there.
[84:56.89]Blood quality.
[84:57.69]The blood quality indicates how much XP you're going to obtain.
[84:59.93]The higher the blood quality, the more experience.
[85:02.99]How do I...?
[85:03.41]What?
[85:23.53]Alright, and you just whisper in their ear and say, Come with me.
[85:35.75]I was trying just to push him in the water.
[85:41.78]Follow the red trail to lead your prey into the shadows.
[85:47.66]Blood temptation.
[85:48.64]Press A to embrace Clay Cox or B to release him.
[85:53.68]Embracing clay will provide a massive massive XP boost but be aware that there will be consequences Learning more about citizens and collecting their hints will increase the experience gained They think blood lord blood lord blood lord Let's embrace let's embrace Mr.. Cox here I Need I need like whisper in his ear There you go
[86:23.88]The EA conference this week will not have any cringe material in it.
[86:27.92]That will be on YouTube.
[86:32.02]In the back, you bastard.
[86:35.04]Didn't have the guts to fart me.
[86:37.62]Fuck you.
[86:39.10]I'll kill you.
[86:41.40]I got his trust.
[86:44.40]Lies.
[86:47.50]Oh, it will.
[86:48.40]Oh, it will.
[86:49.20]Oh, by the way.
[86:49.96]Oh, hey, what are we doing next week?
[86:53.25]I don't think I'm going to do it all week, but I think I at least want to do one or two conferences where we just watch and drink a couple of coffees and just hang out and talk shit during the conferences, restream them.
[87:10.14]To taste a life, to embrace its most intimate secrets.
[87:16.43]Such a burden, such a divine sin.
[87:21.63]Okay.
[87:22.31]So, there are consequences for eating citizens.
[87:25.81]Maybe, uh... Maybe Mr. Cox later on can give us information on somebody else.
[87:30.58]I don't know.
[87:33.20]This game is made by the Life is Strange people, so... Who knows?
[87:40.67]I haven't seen any blue butterflies yet, so... I'm not sure I like this game.
[87:50.63]Come on and have our night.
[87:51.99]Enter the Pembroke Hospital.
[87:55.43]This is the front door.
[87:57.13]I've little time to play hide and seek with new staff members, no matter how illustrious they may be.
[88:01.72]I apologize, nurse.
[88:05.24]I needed some time to myself.
[88:08.06]This has been the longest and strangest night of my life.
[88:12.66]You delivered poor Mr. Hampton from a terrible fate.
[88:15.80]The means to that end should be of little concern, Doctor.
[88:18.34]I've got to wash your hands before coming in.
[88:19.75]Thank you, Nurse.
[88:21.31]What can I do for you?
[88:23.13]Dr. Swansea insisted we provide you a quiet office.
[88:26.49]You'll find it on the second floor with your name on the door.
[88:29.97]Thank you.
[88:31.33]Nurse Crane, isn't it?
[88:33.57]Yes, Dorothy Crane.
[88:35.43]Welcome to Pembroke Hospital, Dr. Reed.
[88:37.67]Your office has been prepared.
[88:43.09]I would like to ask a few questions first.
[88:44.13]I need to get to know some people here.
[88:47.74]Where is my room?
[88:49.34]If you could point me in the direction of my room again, Nurse.
[88:52.94]Second floor of the hospital, left after the stairs.
[88:55.90]It's the last vacant office at the end of the corridor.
[88:57.84]Up floor, left stairs.
[88:58.96]Got it.
[89:01.00]Thank you, Nurse Crane.
[89:03.16]And if you could just smear your hands on my face.
[89:07.44]And then I'm going to walk over here and just lick my face and drag my fingers across my cheeks and suck up my fingers like a KFC basket.
[89:15.61]Wow.
[89:16.27]I'm sorry.
[89:17.83]Fucking gross.
[89:20.05]I'm sorry.
[89:20.53]Whatever.
[89:21.81]Good evening.
[89:23.21]I'm Dr. Jonathan Reed, the new surgeon here at the Pembroke.
[89:26.43]Dr. Swansea has already told us about you, sir.
[89:29.81]I'm Nurse Gwyneth Branigan.
[89:31.69]Welcome to the Pembroke Hospital.
[89:33.50]Did he really?
[89:35.40]Excuse me?
[89:35.64]You want to tell us something, man?
[89:36.91]Uh-huh.
[90:06.27]I mean, I don't want to be lewd and gross anymore, but look at, like, that guy on the table.
[90:12.77]He's currently getting worked on.
[90:14.23]Apparently he has a disease.
[90:15.79]He's got, like... Bonerous Orungus.
[90:20.22]A rare disease.
[90:21.20]Alright, I'm done.
[90:25.46]Tell me more about London.
[90:27.36]I'm not familiar with all the staff yet.
[90:29.80]Perhaps you could help me.
[90:30.90]Brilliant professionals.
[90:32.41]Most of them.
[90:33.74]Dr. Swansea has a gift, her recruiting talent.
[90:36.96]Most dearly.
[90:38.73]Is there a problem?
[90:39.49]Oh, it's starting to rain.
[90:40.71]I gotta, it's rained over, guys.
[90:42.25]You see the hint of rain out there?
[90:43.47]That's rainy.
[90:45.60]Now, this is Gwyneth Rannigan.
[90:50.77]It's the way he's examining it.
[90:51.87]The way he's lying there, it's almost like...
[91:13.30]It was almost like he's paying for it.
[91:14.72]Oh, fucking god.
[91:16.68]Just go back to the fun cinematic camera angle.
[91:18.34]Stop it.
[91:18.54]Dr. Cochrane?
[91:18.80]Tippets!
[91:19.00]Got some more info on Dr. Cochrane?
[91:43.60]What do we know about her?
[91:48.34]The only thing that we know about her is this actually looks like somebody scanned my mother's face.
[91:57.48]In fact, I'm convinced that a dev is going to appear in the chat in all capitals and write, He got to the point!
[92:04.18]He got to the point in the game!
[92:05.49]Shh!
[92:06.21]Shh!
[92:06.85]I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet.
[92:12.21]Waiting for it.
[92:21.95]Alright.
[92:22.51]Well, I could ask personal questions.
[92:24.66]Alright, we're gonna just find a way to the second floor.
[92:41.17]I hate to criticize somebody else's work here, but... You half-asked that.
[92:47.75]You really did.
[92:49.61]Not even a stencil there.
[92:54.81]It just doesn't look good at all.
[92:59.46]And you did them all.
[93:01.79]I mean, you know, at some point you understand that this is probably somebody's son probably did these to save some money.
[93:07.20]Right?
[93:08.76]All the workers here, the pay must not be that great.
[93:10.98]They can't hire a graphic designer.
[93:12.48]You know, what are you going to do, like vector art here?
[93:15.30]No.
[93:15.68]This is somebody's, like, 14-year-old son was like, Oh, my son's really into, like, graphic design!
[93:20.41]Oh, is he?
[93:20.89]Oh, that's great!
[93:21.53]And they all kind of don't want to say, like, Oh, boy!
[93:24.83]No!
[93:25.47]We want someone to come in that's professional.
[93:29.86]And then everybody looks at it and they go, oh wow, that's fucking awesome.
[93:34.87]Dr. Swansea is right.
[93:37.19]This place seems perfect to conduct my research.
[93:40.01]Okay, find your office on the second floor.
[93:42.03]Fear and disgust on every street corner.
[93:46.25]The daily routine.
[93:49.94]Good evening, sir.
[93:51.46]Can I help you?
[93:52.18]Unless you're here to fix my face, no.
[93:54.90]What's wrong with his face?
[93:56.12]I don't think you can help me.
[93:57.50]I'm Dr. Reed.
[93:58.70]I've recently taken the position of head surgeon here.
[94:03.01]Should I surgery his face right now?
[94:04.47]You guessed right, Doctor.
[94:06.85]Jerma Shell took my pretty little mug right off.
[94:10.41]Oh, shit.
[94:11.09]Okay.
[94:11.37]But they still call me Thomas Elwood.
[94:14.63]Thanks for the first and last name.
[94:19.69]Where were you stationed, sir?
[94:21.79]Did you serve for long?
[94:23.10]I really don't want to talk about all this shit.
[94:26.24]No offense.
[94:27.64]I was pushing too much.
[94:29.70]I served in France myself.
[94:32.16]I just wanted to know what happened to you.
[94:33.82]You were an officer, weren't you?
[94:36.80]Then I doubt we fought the same war, sir.
[94:40.30]No offense.
[94:42.78]Alright, well.
[94:45.35]Press for details.
[94:48.16]I can mind control it, but I can't mind control it yet.
[94:52.66]How's your stay going?
[94:53.50]How's your stay with us, Mr. Elwood?
[94:55.14]Oh, it's bliss.
[94:57.46]I just escaped death in the trenches to be surrounded again by the moans of the dying.
[95:02.84]Can I ask you precisely why you're a patient here?
[95:06.08]It's the pain, sir.
[95:07.33]Tell us.
[95:08.37]The drugs don't work.
[95:10.69]It just hurts under the scars, if you get my drift.
[95:15.51]Okay.
[95:16.38]Can I do anything for you?
[95:17.84]Can I do blood magic on him?
[95:18.94]Nurses gave me a bunch of pills.
[95:22.10]No effect.
[95:23.88]Told ya.
[95:25.42]It's like the flames are under my skin, burning away.
[95:30.15]I can't hold my hand out and blood magic his face?
[95:35.07]Medical checkup.
[95:35.81]Soldier, do you need assistance?
[95:38.10]I'm fine.
[95:39.52]Just do something for this pain, will ya?
[95:41.48]That's all I'm asking.
[95:50.49]No, I'm not going to embrace him right now.
[96:01.84]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[96:02.72]No!
[96:03.00]God damn it!
[96:06.40]No, no, no, no.
[96:07.16]Release him.
[96:07.60]Alright, I'm going to bring him to the bathroom.
[96:13.30]Oh, shit.
[96:13.87]How did she not see that?
[96:14.87]Okay, uh...
[96:19.73]Go back to bed.
[96:23.19]You just had a migraine and you broke your wrist in the process.
[96:25.76]Alright, he's fine.
[96:30.40]He doesn't remember.
[96:31.10]Good.
[96:34.22]Good evening, nurse.
[96:35.14]Good evening, doctor.
[96:36.66]I don't think we've been introduced yet.
[96:39.06]My name is Pippa Hawkins.
[96:40.76]So this game is just walk around, get personal information about every single person, and then eat them.
[96:47.25]Well, there's a euphemism that your help will be appreciated, Doctor.
[96:53.73]Do you need medical help yourself, Nurse?
[96:56.18]I'm fine, really.
[96:57.58]I just need to sleep.
[96:59.00]Alright, um... I got no details on you.
[97:03.92]How's your life in London?
[97:06.41]How long have you been a nurse for?
[97:07.31]How long have you been a nurse?
[97:08.85]Well, long enough to see that the epidemic is winning.
[97:11.97]And no matter how qualified you are, don't tell me you'll change that.
[97:16.42]Well, I will drain somebody, but I want more experience.
[97:20.44]You need to learn more about them.
[97:22.20]You'd be surprised you are right.
[97:23.40]Change your attitude.
[97:25.98]You'd be surprised what dedication can achieve Nurse Hawkins.
[97:30.44]In medicine, sometimes we're just a test result away from a miracle.
[97:36.36]Sorry, Doctor.
[97:37.14]I'm not gonna drain Hawkins.
[97:38.26]I don't want to sound bitter, but I'm just too tired to give a pep talk like Nurse Branigan.
[97:43.54]Okay, how's the situation?
[97:47.42]How would you describe this situation at the Pembroke Hospital?
[97:50.22]It's serious.
[97:51.78]The flu is wreaking havoc amongst the staff and patients.
[97:55.30]We are running out of everything.
[97:59.08]Get a grip.
[98:01.43]Uh, this won't last forever.
[98:02.61]Nurse Hawkins, the Spanish flu won't last forever.
[98:06.61]Even the Black Plague didn't kill everyone.
[98:09.03]I wish I could believe you.
[98:11.16]But what if this epidemic was worse?
[98:14.20]What if in the end, nobody was spared?
[98:18.26]You must get a hold of yourself, nurse.
[98:21.04]Sorry, I'm exhausted.
[98:22.60]What's wrong with her teeth?
[98:23.54]What do you mean, what's wrong with her teeth?
[98:24.48]No one has any idea when this epidemic will be over.
[98:26.64]I mean, they're a little green, but it's not a big deal.
[98:30.96]1500 experience points for drinking... Pippa.
[98:35.59]Okay, let's get as much info as we can.
[98:38.25]Alright, give me a hint on one of the doctors.
[98:49.99]Why is Milton so grumpy?
[98:50.97]Why is Milton grumpy on a daily basis?
[98:53.57]Increase his blood experience.
[98:54.67]Is it just an act?
[98:55.67]Milton's not the kind of man who's bothered about a bad reputation.
[98:59.47]Whether he deserved it or not.
[99:01.68]There we go.
[99:02.10]Milton hooks.
[99:03.22]New hint available.
[99:04.06]Got it.
[99:05.46]Why does Milton dislike doctors?
[99:07.42]Learn everything we can about Milton and then... Eat him.
[99:10.68]Turn on anti-aliasing?
[99:12.91]It's on.
[99:13.25]See you later.
[99:21.43]I don't have any hints.
[99:22.43]Alright, let's go.
[99:24.79]Okay, look at another guy.
[99:28.78]What can you tell me about everything?
[99:39.43]Fear and exhaustion made me say awful things to you, I'm afraid.
[99:42.61]You remained perfectly nice and polite.
[99:45.87]A little delirious, perhaps.
[99:47.06]Perfectly nice.
[99:47.92]But who wouldn't be after enduring an abduction?
[99:50.88]Thank you, Doctor.
[99:51.84]That's a relief.
[99:53.16]Now all I need to do is rest and return to my flock.
[99:58.02]More purses.
[99:58.68]Alright.
[99:59.18]Goodbye, Mr. Hampton.
[100:00.35]I know that this game really wants me to listen to every single thing that everybody has to say, and I will maybe eventually here, but I've got to find my office.
[100:12.01]I got experience points.
[100:13.16]I can level up here.
[100:14.12]And then I'm... The guy that I got the hint on, I'm drinking.
[100:18.14]Do not cough in public.
[100:20.58]Careless, spitting, sneezing, coughing, spread influenza.
[100:23.00]Spread by drop, but sprayed from the nose and throat.
[100:25.24]Do not cough in public.
[100:28.63]I wish that sign was available during my dream that I had.
[100:30.87]Alright, second floor.
[100:32.31]Let's go.
[100:32.61]I want to look around.
[100:41.79]Don't sneeze on the food.
[100:43.99]Nothing?
[100:44.39]Nothing to interact with?
[100:45.39]Nothing?
[100:46.07]Nothing?
[100:52.57]No, I can't go in his office.
[100:57.77]Where's my office?
[100:58.80]Is this my office?
[101:04.02]Whoa!
[101:05.72]That lady has 6,000 experience if I eat that guy.
[101:10.30]Holy shit.
[101:10.80]Melee weapon.
[101:11.28]What is it?
[101:11.52]A sword?
[101:13.04]Used hacksaw?
[101:13.70]Cool.
[101:17.15]Bottle of cheap gin.
[101:18.01]Small bottle.
[101:20.21]Very cool.
[101:24.19]T. Elwood's medical file.
[101:25.47]Did I learn something about T. Elwood?
[101:29.43]Yes, I did.
[101:32.67]Oh, I got a new hint on that guy.
[101:34.07]I can go down.
[101:34.53]Now I can eat him.
[101:37.03]Maybe I should try to get at least two or three hints on different people, right?
[101:46.27]Go utilize that hint.
[101:48.78]There we go, here's my audience.
[101:49.74]Oh yeah, I can't cough.
[101:50.44]Streamer coughs on audience.
[102:05.60]Just wait until Smell-O-Vision becomes a thing.
[102:08.30]Article on Econs.
[102:09.92]Okay, analyze William Bishop's blood.
[102:14.68]Last vial.
[102:19.90]Alright, we can do some crafting here.
[102:27.28]We got blood sample of William Bishop.
[102:29.46]Analyze it.
[102:33.39]Serums light regeneration serum regenerate 300 health points instantly then 150 health points over 15 seconds I Can level up treatments and all that jazz We got here used hacksaw The hacksaw is actually better than all this stuff This is two-handed bludgeon or This thing uses more stamina
[103:00.66]65.
[103:00.98]Let's do the hacksaw.
[103:02.90]Let's level up the used hacksaw.
[103:04.18]Common hacksaw.
[103:05.64]Don't have enough.
[103:08.82]Hydrate the flower.
[103:10.07]Alright.
[103:13.23]Alright.
[103:13.75]Relax.
[103:14.11]I will hydrate the flower.
[103:16.03]Never.
[103:16.27]Rest in the bed.
[103:16.99]I can feel it.
[103:28.02]I'm gonna watch that flower die.
[103:29.24]I'll continue tomorrow night.
[103:30.46]I have so much time.
[103:34.92]The flower's dying.
[103:37.20]It needs water.
[103:40.19]I will.
[103:40.73]Don't worry.
[103:41.17]First let me level up my vampire abilities.
[103:45.15]Eat the flower.
[103:45.77]Embrace the flower.
[103:46.55]Alright, what we got?
[103:48.87]Blood barrier.
[103:49.47]You create an invisible barrier absorbing direct damage until it fades.
[103:53.83]You will block your target's blood in their veins, making them defenseless.
[103:58.34]So he just drops their armor and stuff.
[104:00.82]Okay.
[104:02.98]I could do more healing.
[104:05.76]Bite could be better.
[104:06.64]Blood.
[104:07.98]More blood capacity.
[104:09.24]Shadow mist.
[104:10.22]Hmm.
[104:12.66]I feel like I need... I feel like my bite needs to be better.
[104:17.60]100% more damage from a bite.
[104:24.25]Turn the flower into a vampire.
[104:28.32]I'm thinking blood absorption and blood damage.
[104:33.86]That's what I'm going to do.
[104:39.24]Blood damage.
[104:40.10]Bite damage and bite the amount of blood you take.
[104:45.77]I like that.
[104:46.21]I can do something else.
[104:48.95]I can do this more than once.
[104:51.69]Yeah, let's get this out of the way.
[104:52.87]Let's actually get this over with.
[104:54.77]So I don't do this ever again.
[104:56.41]And by ever again, I mean in, like, maybe an hour.
[104:58.33]I'll do it again.
[104:58.87]I don't have enough for anything else.
[105:00.73]Blood Spear.
[105:03.33]Level 2 is not quite there.
[105:05.48]I need level 8.
[105:08.54]What about 300?
[105:08.86]It's all 300.
[105:09.70]300, 300, 300!
[105:09.76]Yeah.
[105:09.96]Yeah.
[105:10.08]Yeah.
[105:10.18]Yeah.
[105:21.27]1300, okay.
[105:24.60]Lock it in!
[105:28.30]Big goal.
[105:32.68]Okay, got the citizen menu here.
[105:35.41]Every night the consequences of your actions may improve or degrade the district's health status.
[105:39.85]It can also be degraded due to diseases spreading among citizens.
[105:44.49]The more lives you take, the unhealthier a district becomes.
[105:48.24]If a district's health status drops below the critical threshold, it will plunge into chaos.
[105:52.28]It's for you to decide a district's fate.
[105:57.15]Oh.
[105:58.83]You're telling me I ate one dude?
[106:01.63]And we went all the way down here?
[106:05.39]This guy's worth 700 XP.
[106:09.33]Okay, there's no... I'm not gonna... I'm not eating mom.
[106:11.47]I'll tell you that right now.
[106:14.89]I'm not doing that.
[106:17.56]I could consume dad.
[106:20.04]Wait, these two are not married.
[106:21.81]Okay.
[106:23.01]The way that I looked at this, this was bride and groom right here.
[106:27.29]They're dressed like that, right?
[106:34.34]No, I'm not eating the whole... We'll eat this guy.
[106:36.76]Let's get some more info on him.
[106:39.52]Level 1 mesmerize.
[106:41.01]Sounds good.
[106:44.01]Help the Pembroke Hospital to cope with the epidemic.
[106:47.09]Okay.
[106:59.72]I've analyzed the blood, but the result is only partial.
[107:01.70]The blood sample was much more unstable than human blood and showed heavy mutation.
[107:06.73]But this is not what happened to me.
[107:09.03]I must keep on searching.
[107:10.27]Gather more evidence on what's going on.
[107:12.45]Time may be on my side, but not on London's.
[107:15.67]Killing tons of people.
[107:17.65]City's on the verge of collapse.
[107:20.05]Now I need to answer the door.
[107:22.88]Yes, how are you?
[107:25.28]This lady still hasn't answered.
[107:30.70]Okay, we're... Hold on a second.
[107:33.35]I think I just let her in.
[107:34.47]Oh, never mind.
[107:35.99]Still hasn't washed her hands.
[107:36.93]Look at how dry that blood is.
[107:38.47]Only eat S+, boys.
[107:58.48]There's nothing here.
[107:59.20]No antiseptics at all.
[108:00.38]Are you serious?
[108:01.04]What type of hospital are you running?
[108:03.66]No antiseptics?
[108:05.80]You have been away too long, Doctor.
[108:08.30]With the war and now this epidemic, supplies have been running scarce for months now.
[108:13.84]I may have a solution.
[108:15.67]In France, during the war, drug shortage was a daily problem.
[108:18.93]And we had to use our wits to overcome the shortages.
[108:22.71]However do you mean?
[108:24.90]If combined correctly, certain household chemical products can be used in a pinch instead.
[108:30.58]Now, where's the hospital storeroom?
[108:33.26]The storeroom?
[108:34.70]Fat chance.
[108:35.94]This is the Pembroke, and space is luxury we don't have.
[108:40.72]Everything used to be stored in the old morgue.
[108:43.83]Perhaps I should look there first.
[108:45.87]Where is this morgue?
[108:47.80]It's the large building behind the hospital.
[108:50.16]You'll need to go in the back door because it's been sealed off for sanitary reasons.
[108:53.67]The back door.
[108:54.13]Take this key.
[108:55.49]It opens a small back entrance at the end of a narrow street.
[108:58.77]Cool.
[108:59.25]The abandoned morgue behind the hospital.
[109:01.49]Small door at the end of a narrow street.
[109:03.65]On my way then.
[109:04.65]Thank you, nurse.
[109:05.48]I think out loud.
[109:08.62]Bye.
[109:12.14]Yes, doctor?
[109:14.18]Come here.
[109:16.19]Don't you ever go to sleep.
[109:17.21]Why then do you always work the night?
[109:19.63]Don't you ever sleep?
[109:21.37]At the Pembroke, we're always hands on deck.
[109:27.29]Lack of sleep and the medical profession always ends in disaster.
[109:31.25]That's 2000 experience points.
[109:32.37]I've witnessed many a colleague succumb to stimulants to fight exhaustion.
[109:35.18]I don't trust anybody who doesn't wash their hands in three days.
[109:37.00]Drugs were as deadly as bullets in the trenches.
[109:41.09]London's trenches start here at Pembroke Hospital.
[109:44.45]We are on the front line, make no mistake.
[109:46.42]Are you Russian?
[109:50.18]Your dedication to the Pembroke does you credit, Nurse Crane, but when do you sleep?
[109:54.92]We staff get our sleep when we can, Doctor.
[109:57.00]She keeps looking at the camera.
[109:57.80]Nursing is a vocation, not the labor of a journeyman.
[110:03.24]Alright, fine, goodbye.
[110:05.52]That's all for now, Nurse Crane, thank you.
[110:08.98]You don't want to drink somebody unless you have adequate knowledge about them.
[110:13.80]Because that's 2,500 now, but she could be worth like 4,000 probably.
[110:16.92]And then she never comes back, so why would I want to do that?
[110:18.73]Alright, back door.
[110:22.11]I'm going to go in the back door.
[110:32.06]A small bottle.
[110:35.24]Here we go.
[110:35.68]Time for some gameplay.
[110:41.30]That's the locked door.
[110:42.14]Gonna go around the small alley, she said.
[110:44.00]This is a secret way to get up there.
[110:47.57]Probably not.
[110:50.81]But this looks like a small alley.
[110:57.25]Mm-hmm.
[110:58.85]Wait.
[111:03.33]Quarantine influenza.
[111:05.55]John F. Kennedy.
[111:07.84]I should investigate.
[111:09.38]If they were to find somebody.
[111:11.59]Skull voices in the garden.
[111:12.99]Skull voices in the garden.
[111:14.49]I should investigate.
[111:16.03]If they were to find somebody.
[111:18.71]This is the cleric beast.
[111:22.15]Dazzled skull.
[111:24.20]Level 7.
[111:24.54]Alright, time to investigate.
[111:27.22]Should I eat a skull?
[111:28.88]Is that going to be bad for me?
[111:32.42]Can you get, like, diseased blood?
[111:33.62]I think I shouldn't be doing this.
[111:46.25]back it up whoa there's another skull hold on let's get a collateral here this guy's resistant to everything not that okay so now what do I do investigate the skulls
[112:16.50]What?
[112:16.90]Whoa!
[112:17.72]Photography in a wallet.
[112:20.34]A photography?
[112:22.84]A photography of a smiling and loving couple with a few words written on the back.
[112:26.75]Milton and Pippa forever.
[112:28.11]Ooh, really?
[112:31.21]We just got some information.
[112:38.36]Pippa apparently is in that photo.
[112:41.10]Interesting.
[112:43.96]Look at the trash.
[112:46.94]Lead stick.
[112:50.74]Anything else?
[112:51.26]I mean, there's random places I can just go.
[112:55.57]This is not the morgue, but something else.
[113:03.25]Oh, fuck.
[113:04.55]Hold on a second.
[113:05.31]I gotta take that out of the title.
[113:09.47]I have to take that out of the title.
[113:11.39]We're taking out the prescribing epic jokes.
[113:14.17]It's been an hour and a half.
[113:16.09]It's gone.
[113:18.20]It's gone.
[113:18.78]I'm not keeping it there.
[113:24.69]I fucking keep forgetting about that.
[113:26.73]It's gone.
[113:32.27]I can't believe I let that sit there as long as I did.
[113:35.11]How embarrassing.
[113:37.43]That was a pre-stream chat joke that I left in there for two hours.
[113:44.14]Whatever.
[113:45.69]The people that are just trickling in, random people clicking on the stream are like, I fucking hate this guy.
[113:53.97]I hate him.
[113:55.09]I hate him.
[113:57.35]I went the wrong way.
[114:01.50]The door is like right here.
[114:08.51]It's still there.
[114:09.39]Epic fail.
[114:10.15]Oh my god.
[114:11.17]No, it's there for you guys because you have it cached in your browser.
[114:14.81]For new people that come in, they're not going to see that.
[114:21.55]The old morgue.
[114:22.25]Healthy!
[114:26.45]Find useful medicinal ingredients in the old morgue.
[114:28.83]Find some ferocious tartar.
[114:31.17]Find some quinine.
[114:32.57]Find some sodium hypocrisies.
[114:34.89]And bring back the wallet.
[114:36.19]You got it.
[114:39.24]Last vial.
[114:41.26]Sick.
[114:42.52]There are people in here.
[114:44.06]I guess I can eat them.
[114:44.76]It's healthy, so I can eat a few of them.
[114:48.90]Do I need to sneak around?
[114:49.74]Is this place guarded, or what?
[114:52.50]Oh, well, I just left the building.
[114:53.90]Okay.
[114:59.14]I've watched you for seven years, and I still hate you.
[115:04.79]Fine.
[115:05.51]Whatever.
[115:05.99]Well, I did unlock the door, so...
[115:14.22]Wait, why do I need a loading screen for that?
[115:17.94]Whoa, okay, here we are.
[115:19.20]Hey, hey, hey, whoa now, hey now.
[115:20.41]Don't tell him.
[115:28.00]And who are you?
[115:28.74]Your name has no meaning to me, mortal.
[115:32.20]You're nothing but dust blown by the winds of eternity.
[115:35.42]I beg your pardon?
[115:36.39]What are you begging for, mortal?
[115:38.31]My clemency?
[115:39.61]Well, tonight maybe I'm inclined to mercy.
[115:42.89]You'll never forget the night you met Thelma Howcroft.
[115:45.65]You keep calling me mortal.
[115:47.99]Why is that?
[115:49.76]And if I'm mortal, what are you?
[115:52.64]Well, Dr. Reed, if you must know,
[116:00.15]What?!
[116:00.83]Do you require my services, Miss Howard?
[116:02.68]No way!
[116:02.92]I have no need for your medicine, Dr. Reed.
[116:06.52]Blood is the only drug I need.
[116:11.05]Let's get some personal questions.
[116:12.23]Who are you really, Miss Howcroft?
[116:14.83]I mean, apart from being a vampire.
[116:17.21]Is that not enough for you, puny mortal?
[116:20.12]Okay, I'm fine.
[116:20.56]What do you require?
[116:22.22]Proof of my powers?
[116:23.16]I'm curious to know who you were before becoming a vampire.
[116:27.66]No, such a long time ago, I don't remember.
[116:30.52]Centuries of unholy life can have strange effects on one's minds, you see?
[116:34.41]Oh.
[116:37.83]I can't.
[116:38.21]She's level two.
[116:38.93]I can't brainwash her.
[116:44.05]I'm assuming you must be a patient here.
[116:46.65]Am I right, Miss Howard?
[116:47.73]It's only a cover to hide from my enemies.
[116:51.29]I can leave whenever I want.
[116:52.95]As a woman, a spirit, fog, or bat.
[116:58.82]Well.
[116:59.08]Oh, there's some red flags.
[117:04.38]I think we might need to take a step back.
[117:07.79]She may have lost it.
[117:09.23]Who are these enemies you mentioned?
[117:11.63]Can you describe them?
[117:13.09]I cannot say for sure.
[117:15.10]But I sense their eyes on me from nearby.
[117:18.08]I feel them watching me every time I visit the garden near the morgue.
[117:22.98]We'll take good care of them.
[117:23.64]The staff here are not your enemy.
[117:26.12]They're here to help you.
[117:27.56]To care for you.
[117:28.48]I'm not speaking of the doctors in white.
[117:30.98]I'm speaking of the men and women who hunt me.
[117:33.66]For I am a vampire.
[117:35.69]I see.
[117:37.05]Don't worry.
[117:38.45]These people will not find you here.
[117:40.99]I'll personally make sure they leave you alone.
[117:43.57]Thank you, mortal.
[117:44.71]But do not interfere with them, for you are no match for those that hunt me.
[117:49.78]A new citizen investigation is available.
[117:52.32]Let's do... Okay, let's... Wrong target.
[117:54.50]New investigation.
[117:57.77]Citizen investigations displayed here, categorized by districts.
[118:00.73]You can start a new citizen quest by tracking it with X, then access your map to locate the area.
[118:09.12]Wrong target.
[118:10.28]Find out who is spying on her.
[118:11.78]Yeah, let's do it.
[118:14.42]I want to do this right now.
[118:17.22]I'll leave you, mistress of the dark, to your nocturnal activities.
[118:24.45]So then, what does that appear as on the mini-map?
[118:26.56]Just the... Let me see.
[118:30.22]Hideout?
[118:30.58]I'm wrong.
[118:31.84]Okay, so it's now the head.
[118:35.56]Hideout.
[118:36.12]Oh, there's like a lot to do in this game, it seems.
[118:38.10]Alright, I'm gonna go out there.
[118:39.28]Let's see who's stalking her.
[118:42.68]Find them.
[118:45.21]Well, where'd they go?
[118:45.77]They just left my map.
[118:48.63]Is it inside the hospital, then?
[118:51.17]What the fuck are you talking about, man?
[118:56.43]It's like down this alley down here.
[119:07.73]OK.
[119:09.93]Apparently not.
[119:12.53]Is it this dude right here?
[119:15.75]Thelma Howcroft said she was being watched by vampire hunters.
[119:20.35]Where are they hiding?
[119:22.55]I should investigate.
[119:23.71]Is this a vampire hunter?
[119:26.46]I think it's just the area.
[119:27.30]Alright, we'll find out.
[119:28.70]Let's talk to this guy.
[119:31.41]Good evening.
[119:32.47]I'm Dr. Reed.
[119:33.47]Always a pleasure to meet a colleague, sir.
[119:35.99]Especially when he was supposedly dead.
[119:37.99]A colleague.
[119:39.34]Are you a doctor, too?
[119:40.48]Not anymore, sir.
[119:41.48]It's not gone.
[119:42.58]I used to be Dr. Rakesh Chaddana.
[119:45.24]Now, I'm just Mr. Chaddana.
[119:48.18]Pawnbroker and humble guardian of this morgue.
[119:50.98]What do you mean?
[119:51.68]You're not getting a four-minute-long ass-eating sequence.
[119:54.30]Was your license revoked?
[119:55.74]No, sir.
[119:56.86]Really nice is funny.
[119:57.53]It's just that I like to be precise.
[119:58.85]That's not in the game.
[120:00.01]I run a little pawn shop while taking care of the dead.
[120:02.85]No, that's not in the game.
[120:03.87]But I used to be a real doctor.
[120:05.65]Why would that be in this game?
[120:08.05]What are you even talking about?
[120:08.97]Please show me what you have to sell.
[120:10.69]Of course.
[120:11.91]It's just trinkets and curios, really.
[120:14.97]But I'm sure they can be useful.
[120:16.33]That's total horseshit.
[120:17.07]I do not believe it for a second.
[120:18.37]Alright.
[120:18.59]We got codeine, opium, and apparently some other thing.
[120:25.72]I got 120 bucks.
[120:26.10]I don't... Let's buy one of each.
[120:34.25]And this is a formula to be analyzed.
[120:36.53]Let's get it.
[120:37.53]Why not?
[120:37.85]I'm going to spend my money somewhere.
[120:41.41]They are not lying.
[120:44.10]Don't make me have to play through half this game to see that.
[120:47.84]I'm kind of interested already, so why the fuck do I care?
[120:52.38]Alright, local investigation.
[120:54.86]So it's just... I have to find this fucking person.
[120:58.31]Find out who's spying on them.
[121:03.07]Hunter down because he's a vampire.
[121:04.51]Maybe I should spy on them and protect Thelma.
[121:10.35]Whatever.
[121:14.37]Now I have to see.
[121:17.85]Nurses are needed now.
[121:18.75]Inquire at the nearest labor and national blank.
[121:21.21]In the name of mercy.
[121:23.33]There's a lot of people in here.
[121:27.52]Unknown.
[121:28.08]Unknown.
[121:28.34]There's so many random people in here.
[121:29.70]God.
[121:31.18]God.
[121:35.19]There are too many people to talk to.
[121:36.31]There's a lot of people to talk to.
[121:37.29]Good evening, sir.
[121:37.71]I'm Dr. Reed.
[121:38.45]I believe we're going to be colleagues.
[121:40.09]Reed?
[121:40.65]Yes, I've been informed about your arrival.
[121:43.37]I'm Waverly Ackroyd.
[121:44.95]Welcome aboard, I suppose.
[121:46.39]Does my arrival inconvenience you in some way, Dr. Ackroyd?
[121:50.14]Let us just say that I don't particularly share Dr. Swans' enthusiasm for hiring you.
[121:55.66]What we need here are reliable professionals, not overrated dabblers.
[122:00.84]Yeah.
[122:02.12]Okay, um...
[122:04.84]let's see what we got about the uh do you have a problem if you have a problem with me Dr. akroyd please feel free to tell me Dr. swanzey has imposed your presence on this hospital without asking anyone's advice but I don't agree with it I know we've never met before but I believe this hospital could use all the help it can get you will agree with that I'm sure oh but I have heard about you Dr. reed
[122:32.59]Of course you can't say the same about me, since I have not wasted my time courting the press.
[122:42.37]Aren't you too old for such jealousy?
[122:44.49]All your teeth are sharp.
[122:45.41]It really won't do you any good, you know.
[122:47.21]Don't be ridiculous, Dr. Reed.
[122:49.39]A simple glance is enough for me to know you have nothing for me to envy.
[122:54.83]Since your tenure in this hospital is longer than mine, perhaps you can tell me more about this.
[122:59.94]Let's just say I'm tired of the carelessness around me.
[123:05.10]I have always respected the skills of Dr. Swansea, but over time, his enthusiasm has become displaced.
[123:12.65]Carelessness?
[123:14.51]Exactly what are you talking about?
[123:16.37]We're here to save lives.
[123:18.57]The people who trust us are not volunteering for experimentation.
[123:21.89]They're here to be healed.
[123:23.17]I don't intend to run any radical experiments.
[123:26.06]I'm doing alright.
[123:27.14]Even if I, as any good practitioner should, express an interest in pushing the boundaries of medical research.
[123:33.84]Modern medical methods were created through audacity and ego.
[123:38.20]But there are rules in our line of work, and they're here to protect our patients.
[123:43.09]Okay, well, we got a new hint from Dr. Waverly Ackroyd.
[123:48.67]Thank you for your time.
[123:50.27]We'll talk later.
[123:59.37]Let's keep looking around out here.
[124:04.19]So, from my understanding, this is just...
[124:09.61]I just have to... I mean, there's a spot back here in the alley.
[124:13.02]I wonder if there's anything back there.
[124:17.48]Local investigation.
[124:20.88]Somebody's definitely right here.
[124:24.24]And they're going to be like, Thelma, yes, we must eat.
[124:27.70]God damn it.
[124:30.50]Wait, hold on.
[124:32.66]Hold on.
[124:36.53]Ooh, okay.
[124:40.15]There's somebody here.
[124:41.69]Or across the hall.
[124:46.13]Found him.
[124:49.18]These are the ones that are hunting her.
[124:50.70]Found ya.
[124:51.12]Alright, let's go with the game plan here.
[124:54.84]This dude is melee resistant and he is range resistant.
[125:00.83]Let's bite this guy first.
[125:14.84]And... yep!
[125:17.28]Bury him.
[125:18.82]Come on, do it.
[125:25.80]Get outta here.
[125:26.74]Alright.
[125:30.50]Investigation complete.
[125:32.53]Found the two culprits.
[125:35.09]Pick up the note on the table and weed it.
[125:38.41]25th October, from Guard of Pruin Command Post to East End Patrols.
[125:43.48]Vampire activity hospital survey investigated three days ago.
[125:45.90]One of our new recruits heard a rumor about the presence of a female vampire hiding in the Pembroke Hospital, London East End.
[125:51.88]All we have is her first name, Thelma.
[125:54.58]Your mission is to discreetly go there and observe any suspicious activity concerning said leech.
[126:00.06]Then report directly back to us and we will decide what action should be taken.
[126:04.22]She was right.
[126:06.88]Find the local command post of the Guard of Prillin.
[126:11.72]Alright.
[126:13.48]Looking good so far.
[126:16.04]Anything in there?
[126:17.27]No.
[126:28.13]Co-op Jupiter.
[126:29.91]They're always in chat.
[126:30.77]You can always find a good, like, rare Jupiter in chat sometimes.
[126:35.64]I'm aware I just said always and then sometimes, but... You know what I'm trying to say.
[126:48.41]I hope you guys enjoy using those emotes because... Jupiter 3 is the $10 emote and Jupiter 4 is the $25 emote starting next week.
[126:57.04]No, Jupiter 1 is the $10 and Jupiter 4 is the $25.
[127:04.17]I'm kidding.
[127:04.63]I'm not gonna do that.
[127:05.59]It's a joke.
[127:06.85]Whoa, I want to open up the trash can.
[127:07.99]Hold on.
[127:09.37]Imagine if I did that.
[127:12.43]That would be so, so awful.
[127:15.42]Where is this guy that's screaming?
[127:18.84]Whoa.
[127:21.58]You are too high for me.
[127:22.84]That's a level 18.
[127:23.62]Should I try to prove it that I can do it?
[127:27.98]I'm gonna get one shot.
[127:33.75]That's too much.
[127:39.66]I'll try it.
[127:43.32]Melee resistant and blood resistant.
[127:44.94]This is terrible.
[127:45.70]I need to put my gun.
[127:46.66]Get my gun out.
[127:51.13]Gun.
[127:56.25]Offhand.
[127:57.13]I need the gun.
[128:00.31]Put this on.
[128:01.15]I gotta take this off.
[128:07.31]How do I remove this?
[128:11.77]Change, change.
[128:12.35]There we go.
[128:15.83]There.
[128:18.11]Okay, main hand, off hand.
[128:19.58]Here we go.
[128:23.94]Alright.
[128:25.20]Come down here.
[128:27.48]He has a move.
[128:28.08]I don't know what that move is.
[128:30.43]I've never shot the gun before though, so I don't know how this works.
[128:41.58]That barely hurt him.
[128:44.50]Oh god.
[129:03.22]Come on, get up there.
[129:17.36]I got some blood back.
[129:18.58]He's gonna dive at me.
[129:32.77]I know he's resistant to it, but it's easy to do.
[129:39.00]Whoa!
[129:39.80]Whoa!
[129:41.90]I was trying to parry that like a fucking idiot.
[129:45.26]That was dumb.
[129:46.36]We just gotta... Nice knowing you.
[129:51.97]Thanks.
[129:52.29]Bye.
[129:52.53]You got all of his health like that.
[129:56.59]That guy is 2.22 to 3 times my level.
[130:04.25]These guys are all so much higher than me.
[130:06.83]I'm not supposed to be here right now.
[130:13.79]Is he still chasing me?
[130:15.79]Is he going to come behind me?
[130:17.11]I'm so scared of this guy.
[130:18.11]He's over there.
[130:18.57]Okay.
[130:19.57]Relax.
[130:21.17]Okay.
[130:21.55]What does this guy got?
[130:22.51]Melee.
[130:23.23]I can't hurt this guy.
[130:36.24]I think I'm going to put the... the two-hander back on.
[130:41.74]Just because it's... It's bullets.
[130:45.69]Okay, I got bullets for that.
[130:49.95]Well, I'm just going to have to dance around this guy and hopefully I don't lose.
[130:52.83]This is going to be... Test of strength.
[130:54.09]Here we go.
[130:54.35]Let's see if I lose to the people two times my level.
[131:05.26]Oh, no.
[131:05.98]More than one person here.
[131:07.72]Guy's got a gun.
[131:10.08]Hey.
[131:10.42]Oh, ow.
[131:10.80]Fuck.
[131:11.16]Fuck is right.
[131:36.27]I gotta kill him.
[131:37.29]Whoa!
[131:48.37]I dodged that.
[131:49.29]Okay.
[131:57.16]Now, anybody drop anything?
[131:59.02]No.
[132:02.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[132:10.97]I need to drink this guy.
[132:13.75]Although that's not really gonna do anything for me.
[132:16.01]I need to put the other weapon on.
[132:17.01]I need to stun him.
[132:20.83]Fuck.
[132:21.53]I need to drink you, but I need to stun you.
[132:31.26]Okay.
[132:33.26]Getting close.
[132:36.50]This is the Dark Souls of Evanescence fans.
[132:41.76]I mean, combat is fairly fun.
[132:47.24]Seems to be quite interesting and deliberate, right?
[132:49.88]Do I dare?
[132:51.96]No.
[132:54.06]Not doing that.
[133:01.65]Where am I going?
[133:04.71]Please kill him.
[133:05.71]I know, he's so annoying.
[133:09.44]He's just, he's doing Steven Tyler.
[133:12.33]And it's the Steven Tyler reverse weird bird scream is really cool.
[133:18.05]But what the fuck was that?
[133:24.38]What the fuck?
[133:25.08]Holy shit.
[133:25.74]That bug is huge.
[133:30.02]He's trying to get in my house.
[133:35.87]He's trying to get in my window.
[133:43.94]What the fuck is that thing?
[133:45.68]It's an alien.
[133:51.10]Hold on.
[133:55.16]What are you?
[133:55.68]What are you?
[133:56.20]You look the thing from the fucking Silence of the Lambs.
[133:59.57]Hold on, I'm gonna turn the camera on.
[134:00.59]We're gonna investigate it.
[134:03.65]I'm actually, Jesus Christ.
[134:06.43]I'm actually scared to come over here.
[134:13.07]Fuck.
[134:13.39]Okay, hold on.
[134:16.45]It's like... What?
[134:23.99]I can't get in here.
[134:24.67]Stop being so afraid of it.
[134:25.57]It cannot get in here.
[134:28.67]Alright, there's a dead fly in the window, but don't pay attention to that.
[134:35.52]I'm just trying to make it look like I'm not dirty.
[134:37.56]Now, let's take a look.
[134:42.64]You guys ready?
[135:14.22]Can you see it?
[135:16.41]You can hear it, right?
[135:18.29]It's smashing into the window.
[135:19.49]Come on camera, focus.
[135:41.55]Is it gone?
[135:46.72]I think it's gone.
[135:54.59]It's gonna jump right in the middle of the screen.
[135:59.39]That's gone.
[136:00.89]No, it isn't.
[136:08.10]You guys could hear that, right?
[136:10.10]You at least could hear it, right?
[136:17.32]Yeah.
[136:22.19]You couldn't hear that?
[136:24.45]Are you serious that this was a waste of fucking time?
[136:28.10]It was like smashing into the wall, screaming.
[136:46.67]That's not a bug.
[136:47.49]That's a mirror.
[136:48.31]No, you guys saw it.
[136:49.71]You saw it.
[136:50.17]It was going... Somebody is going to go into that VOD and they're going to turn the volume up and they're going to hear it.
[137:07.35]Yes.
[137:07.95]Yes, you will.
[137:10.53]Oh, it's because the stupid background music was on.
[137:12.62]You probably could have heard that in the background music.
[137:17.47]fucking hate bugs I hate them dude I can't wait to move out to the desert where there's no bugs I mean there are here's the difference there are a bunch of little scary bugs out here going to the desert there's only like a handful of huge bugs I can deal with that
[137:40.47]They were just giant scorpions out in the desert.
[137:42.71]They're not like mosquitoes.
[137:43.91]Like ticks and shit like that.
[137:46.46]Weird giant moths that fly into your window to try to bite you.
[137:54.26]I can deal with one or two huge spiders versus 2,000 little ones.
[137:58.78]No thanks.
[137:59.19]Alright, we got some... Don't touch me with your disgusting hands.
[138:03.01]Alright, we got somebody in here.
[138:03.87]I think we actually may have found what we were looking for.
[138:11.84]Careful, the endangered citizen may not survive the next night.
[138:14.98]Go check on him.
[138:15.68]Oh my god, they're just... It's locked.
[138:24.98]Defeat the skulls.
[138:27.26]Save the band.
[138:27.86]Okay.
[138:43.58]Alright, here we go.
[138:45.70]Save the man.
[138:46.52]Fight the skulls.
[138:47.60]13.
[138:47.64]Level 13.
[138:48.28]You got it.
[138:48.64]I'm gonna fall down.
[138:52.66]Oh, fuck me.
[138:54.32]Holy dog shit.
[138:56.38]I'm stuck!
[139:00.78]Bad place to fight.
[139:03.82]Oh, shit.
[139:05.34]I think we're fine.
[139:06.94]Yep.
[139:07.46]There's this one here.
[139:08.12]Okay, I can take one.
[139:09.18]It's so much higher than me.
[139:10.40]It's not even fair.
[139:15.73]I can fucking teleport, what a joke.
[139:20.42]Watch out, watch the stamina.
[139:26.50]Whoa!
[139:28.06]What was that?
[139:31.32]What was that fucking lunge?
[139:43.86]kit I need to heal a lot of stuff in here though can I there's nothing I can craft in here right I need to eat a rat or something any rats in here why did you do that why would you do that I'm not ready for that
[140:13.50]Guys.
[140:15.65]Hey.
[140:17.09]How you doing?
[140:17.67]What?
[140:18.97]What happened?
[140:21.27]Who are you?
[140:21.88]It's alright, sir.
[140:23.72]You're safe now.
[140:25.42]A fellow Englishman.
[140:26.80]Thank you, sir.
[140:28.29]For a moment, I thought those bloody heathens would kill me.
[140:31.05]What are you doing here?
[140:32.43]This place is not safe.
[140:34.02]Yeah, it's a cesspool, but it's mine.
[140:36.28]I came to collect some overdue rent, but those who still live here have gone completely bonkers.
[140:40.74]You're very lucky to be alive.
[140:42.54]Yeah, filthy immigrants, fucking savages, every one of them.
[140:46.29]And now with this bloody fever, they're just animals.
[140:49.07]You can find safety of sorts in Whitechapel.
[140:52.19]Send him to the church.
[140:52.81]If you're quick and cautious, we'll be able to avoid that.
[140:55.31]Savages.
[140:58.72]You rescued a citizen.
[140:59.44]He will return to his district the following night.
[141:01.70]Okay.
[141:05.80]So, where's he from?
[141:07.90]He's cold.
[141:09.00]30% loss of blood quality.
[141:12.23]Lost.
[141:12.71]He's going back.
[141:15.19]He's going back to Whitechapel.
[141:18.33]He's in serious condition.
[141:19.47]He's going back to the hospital.
[141:20.55]Or so.
[141:23.52]Alright.
[141:24.76]Bye.
[141:27.43]I'm not going to get this guy killed, right?
[141:30.89]Experience for that?
[141:31.51]Anyone else with draws?
[141:36.43]I can sleep with you.
[141:37.65]No, I can't.
[141:38.99]I can't read Braille.
[141:41.59]Somebody else has to do it.
[141:45.49]Clove Essence.
[141:49.05]So this game... Okay, here's my two to three hours in the game so far.
[141:53.31]Reception of the game.
[141:55.26]I think...
[141:56.88]this game is it's it's all over the place but I feel like it's one of those games that's so all over the place that it's okay some games are all over the place and they're like unbearable but this is there's enough co here like there's enough coherence here to sort of understand what the hell's happening there's a lot of little missions
[142:27.52]I don't know, though.
[142:28.92]I could start to hate this game in about 40 minutes.
[142:31.32]I'm not sure.
[142:37.70]Cohesion.
[142:38.34]Yeah, there's a lot of cohesion in this game.
[142:40.74]Coherence.
[142:44.04]Two guys are up here.
[142:44.80]I wonder if I should fight them.
[142:48.24]Anything in this room besides these two?
[142:52.48]No.
[142:53.04]Just get out of here.
[142:54.08]No reason to do this.
[142:57.68]625.
[142:57.74]I need to drink somebody.
[142:59.54]I need to make some experience points.
[143:03.99]Cohesion.
[143:04.89]Coheed and Cambria.
[143:09.57]What does that song go?
[143:14.27]I was about to just scream it, and that would have been a bad idea.
[143:19.52]Cohesive and Cambria.
[143:23.04]When the guy gets really loud, he kind of sounds like a muppet.
[143:26.71]Your eyes tell the story of the day we wish you make it.
[143:37.10]Cue that up side by side with that song and it's the same exact thing.
[143:43.02]He's mine.
[143:43.82]I'll take him.
[143:44.80]Oh, these guys are... Whoa!
[143:46.94]Oh, shit.
[143:47.58]These guys are way too high.
[143:49.36]No, you won't.
[143:51.08]No, you won't.
[143:54.22]Run.
[143:55.34]Run.
[143:56.34]What's the run button?
[144:00.73]I wandered into the fucking badlands.
[144:05.21]Shit.
[144:06.16]I can't even get out of here.
[144:08.36]I'll kill you.
[144:33.23]What happened?
[144:39.37]Why did it just... Um... Did that last investigation... Did that investigation go through?
[144:49.68]It did, right?
[144:51.52]I hope so.
[144:52.48]That would be really, really irritating if it didn't.
[144:54.18]Take me back to the hospital.
[145:05.07]alright let me prune rookie let's I want to drink this guy I need blood let's get behind this guy oh there's another guy right here okay I can drink that guy's 12. he's got no blood resistance take this guy
[145:36.11]Whoa!
[145:38.87]Take a breath of this!
[145:40.27]Okay!
[146:04.43]Grenade?
[146:05.15]What?
[146:05.39]Oh, it was just gas.
[146:09.84]Okay.
[146:13.26]This, like, vlog gone.
[146:16.48]Give me a break.
[146:17.54]That guy just telephoned across the whole game.
[146:22.08]What is up with that?
[146:23.06]Get me out of here.
[146:25.08]Alright, can I just go back to where I was?
[146:35.49]Hospitals have it.
[146:36.05]Take a right and go down the alley.
[146:46.11]Back to the hospital.
[146:46.89]Nothing else, right?
[146:51.19]Yeah, just go straight in here.
[146:52.93]I need to rest.
[146:53.58]I gotta go talk to that lady.
[147:02.15]And you know what?
[147:02.55]I need some drinks.
[147:04.85]Where's the lady that I got some hints on?
[147:07.03]I'm going to just drain her.
[147:11.96]There's another guy to talk to.
[147:17.06]There's so many people to talk to in this game.
[147:18.62]Do I know anything about this guy?
[147:20.21]I got one hint.
[147:20.67]Okay, 2600.
[147:30.95]I currently need to be level four there, but I can't do it to him.
[147:33.81]Let's see if I can learn something else.
[147:37.69]I've proved my value as a practitioner of bad memories in your military service.
[147:40.28]It seems you have bad memories of your military service.
[147:43.48]I refuse to see this industrial slaughter as scientific progress.
[147:47.96]War only reveals the worst in men.
[147:50.20]We can at least agree on something, Dr. Atkinson.
[147:55.17]I don't know what you've heard about me, but I have already proved my value as a practitioner.
[147:59.84]I don't question your skills, Dr. Reed, but your motive.
[148:03.42]Is it money?
[148:04.40]Fame?
[148:05.56]Or are you truly dedicated?
[148:07.26]And what exactly is that supposed to mean?
[148:09.58]I served in the war just like you.
[148:11.54]Eat his brain.
[148:12.26]But unlike you, I did not use the wounded to play the modern sorcerer.
[148:16.48]Be careful what you insinuate, Dr. Ackroyd.
[148:19.14]I only want you to admit you used those men to improve your theories.
[148:25.06]Shut up.
[148:26.82]I'm sorry.
[148:33.14]I'm trying to like add to it.
[148:34.82]I can't add to it.
[148:37.88]That's how I add to it.
[148:41.99]Knowledge has always been and will remain our main weapon.
[148:45.87]And it has always come at a price.
[148:48.27]And personal initiative.
[148:50.11]It is not a question of initiative.
[148:51.87]It is a question of integrity.
[148:54.90]These men and women have put their faith in us, Dr. Reed.
[148:59.54]Get it?
[149:00.02]Dr. A. Cula, like Dracula the Vampire?
[149:02.70]Haha, get it.
[149:03.30]He's playing a vampire game and the title is a play on words.
[149:06.30]Get it?
[149:06.62]I'm changing the title completely.
[149:09.22]I'm getting rid of the whole thing.
[149:11.80]I'm changing it.
[149:12.40]I am way too self-conscious of this stupid fucking title.
[149:22.11]How about just, like, hashtag prime subs?
[149:24.97]Would that be better?
[149:30.10]Vampyr.
[149:31.48]How about Vampyr Review?
[149:35.14]No, that's not a good one either.
[149:36.60]How about... No, nothing with Dracula.
[149:40.56]Nothing with Dracula.
[149:41.55]We're taking that away from this.
[149:42.63]No Dracula bullshit.
[149:44.63]How about just... Get on now.
[149:52.25]Blood satisfies me.
[149:53.77]I can't think of anything.
[149:54.75]I don't got anything.
[149:58.32]Keep it or riot.
[149:59.92]I need to... I don't even have a title now.
[150:05.20]God damn it.
[150:06.39]I've fucking blown it.
[150:15.44]It's a blood, how about Bloodsuckers, rated R. No, Dr. A. Kula.
[150:24.53]Fuck, what was the other, Andrew Kula?
[150:27.42]I'm retyping in this title.
[150:35.54]Fuck me, man.
[150:38.55]I hate that, that title won't go away.
[150:46.22]Everybody's gonna see that title that tries to find this stream and it's gonna be... Just title it American Healthcare.
[150:55.09]No, but that's like even worse.
[150:56.55]That's even worse than my awful joke here.
[150:58.73]I can't mesmerize him.
[151:02.25]I can't eat him.
[151:02.75]It's so good.
[151:16.06]Thank you for your time.
[151:17.67]We'll talk later.
[151:27.69]Yep, looks like it's the end of the school day.
[151:30.83]Make sure to put your chairs upside down on the desks.
[151:33.83]Why the fuck did they make us do that?
[151:36.79]Why did we do that?
[151:38.73]Was there any reason to, at the end of the school day, to turn your chair upside down and put it on the desk?
[151:46.04]Why couldn't we have just pushed it in?
[151:49.92]Did they just do that to fuck with us as teenagers?
[151:54.84]So they could vacuum.
[151:56.83]They vacuumed every day?
[152:01.83]You don't need to vacuum a floor every single day.
[152:07.37]I could understand if we did that once a week.
[152:11.26]I don't vacuum every day.
[152:13.38]Do you guys turn your sofa upside down to vacuum every single day?
[152:16.94]When was the last time you and your family took your dining room table and took the chairs and turned them upside down and put them on the table to mop your floor?
[152:27.41]Every single fucking day.
[152:28.55]I don't know.
[152:35.17]That's a waste of tax dollars.
[152:38.72]How about instead of mopping the floors every day,
[152:42.93]You get, like, at least one week of- one day a week of, like, a McRib sandwich.
[152:47.59]How awesome would that be?
[152:49.99]You get to up- every Friday?
[152:53.33]You get- you get Domino's on Friday.
[152:55.94]What?
[152:59.22]Alright, let's fucking eat this guy.
[153:00.78]I can mesmerize him.
[153:06.16]What is he worth?
[153:08.50]700.
[153:08.60]It's worth it.
[153:10.04]Do I- do we care about this guy?
[153:16.31]The McRib is back.
[153:18.04]Maybe I'll make that my title.
[153:21.52]He is connected to her, though.
[153:24.82]Maybe I shouldn't do this yet.
[153:29.34]Because she might be angry at the fact that he's dead.
[153:34.71]But I need experience.
[153:35.81]No, let's eat him.
[153:36.73]We got points here.
[153:39.97]Although, you know what?
[153:40.77]I'm going to talk to Thelma.
[153:42.13]Because Thelma might also, after I did the thing for Thelma, might unlock another hint for him.
[153:48.95]We could also eat Thelma, too.
[153:51.88]Let's just... How's your life?
[153:56.16]Here we go.
[153:56.70]Why do you feel responsible for the injury, Thomas?
[154:00.18]What really happened?
[154:01.62]I wasn't disfigured by any Jerma shells.
[154:04.08]It happened during my leave.
[154:07.95]My leave.
[154:08.53]It was an accident.
[154:11.09]Okay.
[154:13.25]What really happened?
[154:13.95]Tell me what really happened.
[154:15.57]I went with a whore in Rouen.
[154:19.86]Dead drunk I was.
[154:22.58]The hotel was a shithole.
[154:25.94]There was a fire that night.
[154:27.44]Did you start the fire?
[154:29.72]Were you trying to avoid going back to the front?
[154:31.62]That's not uncommon.
[154:32.40]It's just that I was asleep when the flames reached the room.
[154:34.11]The girl was long gone.
[154:34.69]Bitch never woke me up.
[154:35.41]Left me to burn.
[154:47.64]Why?
[154:47.78]Why didn't you lie?
[154:48.28]Uh... Beauty is not everything.
[154:49.06]Whoa!
[154:49.18]You can fail hints?
[154:49.66]I didn't know that.
[155:17.63]Get over here.
[155:18.21]Fuck this.
[155:26.79]Come with me.
[155:30.04]Failed, so eat.
[155:31.20]I think... Can they tell what I'm doing?
[155:36.52]I'm doing a magician hand, and he's walking forward.
[155:49.37]How do I dispose of the body?
[155:55.71]Treatment for headache?
[155:58.31]And I got his cross.
[156:16.53]The district's going to suffer the consequences of your actions because you ate somebody.
[156:19.74]Oh boy.
[156:20.70]Oh no.
[156:22.64]Had a little snack.
[156:28.87]Have you ever just wanted to go into a church and just really loudly just...
[156:37.69]Get on their church microphone.
[156:40.26]Good evening, Miss Howcroft.
[156:41.36]Hold on.
[156:43.26]I need blood, Doctor.
[156:44.48]Warm, rich, vibrant blood.
[156:48.46]Alright, we got a hint here.
[156:52.22]You're a vampire.
[156:52.90]And why do you believe you're a vampire?
[156:54.82]I don't need to believe anything.
[156:56.60]It is what I am.
[156:58.28]It is what I feel within this hollow shell of flesh.
[157:04.63]I see.
[157:04.81]This is what we are planning.
[157:06.47]Have you ever heard of Cotard syndrome, Miss Harcroft?
[157:09.62]Never.
[157:10.14]It's a mental illness discovered by a French neurologist named Jules Cotard.
[157:14.44]You've done that already?
[157:15.46]The affected patients are delusional.
[157:18.06]They believe that they are putrefying, that they are dead.
[157:21.78]I could get permission to get into a church just so I could scream.
[157:25.02]Delusional, you say?
[157:26.06]Oh, sad and petty mortal.
[157:29.08]You can't even begin to understand the concept of immortality.
[157:32.63]And you think it is I who am delusional.
[157:35.03]New hint.
[157:36.77]Okay, we got... Actually, we got a couple of hints here.
[157:40.31]She's worth a lot, and I think we're going to do it.
[157:47.41]How do you feel?
[157:47.85]Please, describe to me how you feel.
[157:51.55]What is it like to be a vampire?
[157:53.53]I can hear my body crumble from the inside as my flesh cracks and fades.
[157:59.07]I sense the last pulse of postulant blood within my dying veins.
[158:03.73]I need new blood.
[158:05.27]Big money.
[158:06.75]Was there big money?
[158:07.37]I didn't even see it.
[158:13.79]Here we go.
[158:15.05]Two hints available.
[158:16.59]Tell me about Thomas Elwood.
[158:18.01]I just got jaded.
[158:19.65]Why can I control another vampire?
[158:21.67]Or is she just... She's not a vampire.
[158:23.37]Okay.
[158:39.64]You plan to make him a vampire.
[158:40.44]Are you romantically involved?
[158:41.20]He's dead.
[158:41.76]Alright.
[159:10.35]Tell me, Thelma, what do you really know about vampires?
[159:15.24]I saw one and he saw me.
[159:17.78]I watched him hunt and kill.
[159:20.54]I saw his terrible wounds heal as his victim died.
[159:24.48]And then I knew I was saved.
[159:26.00]You mean you actually saw a vampire here in London?
[159:30.66]Yes, and it has been the answer to my pain.
[159:34.18]I must drink and kill to regenerate my decaying body.
[159:37.34]I am a vampire too.
[159:42.74]You know nothing about vampires.
[159:45.70]She's currently worth 2,000 experience.
[159:48.00]Although I can't mesmerize.
[159:49.89]I'm not high enough level.
[159:52.05]You know nothing.
[159:52.63]You're delusional.
[159:53.19]You could be in danger.
[159:55.39]You could be in danger.
[159:57.84]Let's play to the census here.
[160:02.94]You have no idea what problems your claim could cause if heard by the wrong people, Miss Howcroft.
[160:08.98]You must stop this nonsense now.
[160:11.26]Why fear the truth?
[160:12.84]Strange things live in the dark, Dr. Reed.
[160:15.08]Hello, LXD.
[160:15.42]Strange and ancient beings that were here before this island even had a name.
[160:19.99]Uh, I think you're referring to the dinosaurs.
[160:24.35]In which case, come with me.
[160:25.99]That's it?
[160:29.73]I can't mesmerize.
[160:32.31]Unfortunately, I'll leave you mistress of the dark to your nocturnal activities Alright, well I need to sleep because I need to level up my skill ocean And we haven't even done the main mission yet.
[160:49.18]I'm gonna do that after My quarters are over here
[161:01.04]Mm-hmm.
[161:01.36]Dr. Reed.
[161:01.90]That's not my office.
[161:04.66]It's over here.
[161:12.55]I can also refill.
[161:18.87]Yeah.
[161:20.09]What am I doing?
[161:22.13]Oh, right.
[161:23.25]What am I doing?
[161:27.02]Sleeping apparently.
[161:28.04]Alright.
[161:29.58]Shadow Veil.
[161:30.32]Five stamina used per second when walking.
[161:32.60]It's a toggle.
[161:34.30]Drain your stamina to fade into the shadows and become invisible to most enemies.
[161:37.20]Moving in this state will drain your more stamina.
[161:39.04]You will exit the shadows of your deck or draw a draw when your stamina is empty.
[161:41.92]Okay.
[161:43.10]Spring.
[161:43.42]20 damage.
[161:44.04]You perform a supernatural move to your target and cause a death by landing.
[161:46.76]Okay.
[161:50.04]I think I want to level up.
[161:53.60]I'm going to put one point into Big Sneeze.
[161:57.60]I don't think I need any more points in it, actually.
[162:00.48]I think it's high enough.
[162:07.81]Supernatural moves to your target and causes damage.
[162:09.57]So it's just like a dive.
[162:14.65]How much is it?
[162:15.11]500.
[162:17.25]Give me a break.
[162:22.47]Defensive...
[162:26.43]Damn, I don't know what to do here.
[162:27.51]Maybe, like, more health.
[162:29.01]Plus 100 health, yeah.
[162:34.79]It's only 300.
[162:35.09]Let's go.
[162:35.43]What about this?
[162:44.88]I'll try the dive spring.
[162:48.44]Yeah, let's get it.
[162:52.38]It's a lot, but I want to try it.
[162:55.30]Plus it's a shadow move, right?
[162:56.62]So I don't have really any of those.
[162:59.44]And then I have 500 experience to do blood capacity or more blood when using bite in combat.
[163:11.34]Science.
[163:14.10]More bullets.
[163:15.65]More serums.
[163:17.75]Life that you heal.
[163:18.69]Which is the level up for this?
[163:23.45]Can't do it yet.
[163:24.03]Maybe 8.
[163:29.26]Maybe more bite?
[163:31.02]Should I do more damage with a bite?
[163:39.26]Let's get this.
[163:39.90]More blood.
[163:43.02]What?
[163:43.94]Oh, shit.
[163:44.72]I don't have enough.
[163:48.80]Maybe I'll do bullets.
[163:51.04]I'm so indecisive.
[163:52.03]How about maybe more healing from this move?
[163:53.73]I like this move.
[163:56.10]Recovery 3, recovery 3, 250 healing.
[163:59.96]That's so much money!
[164:08.15]Eh, let's just do blood capacity.
[164:11.87]Level 8.
[164:14.89]That's all I can do.
[164:17.29]Confirm it.
[164:27.36]I ate that person and now we're down to stable.
[164:31.26]Don't want to go into total chaos.
[164:34.78]I've impacted the economy.
[164:38.54]I bought like two serums off somebody.
[164:40.28]Whatever.
[164:42.04]She's worth 2,000.
[164:42.98]I got all the hints.
[164:43.66]I just need to be level 2 mesmerized.
[164:45.86]How do you even level that up?
[164:49.22]I don't understand how you level that up.
[164:55.44]Level 8.
[164:56.12]Stable.
[164:56.86]Refill all.
[164:57.78]I want to go to the workbench, though.
[165:00.94]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[165:03.94]Treatment for headache.
[165:05.40]Use it to cure a sick citizen during a dialogue?
[165:07.32]Okay.
[165:07.68]Alright, we got some stuff here.
[165:09.54]Analyze the view.
[165:10.02]Let's see.
[165:11.28]An enigmatic formula.
[165:15.91]Treatment for fatigue.
[165:16.87]Treatment for cold.
[165:17.79]Alright, there's a guy that's cold that I just sent back to the hospital, right?
[165:23.21]Interesting.
[165:25.58]Weapons, craft.
[165:27.16]On one hand, common machete.
[165:30.88]I like the scythe.
[165:34.82]Let's actually get this to common.
[165:39.36]Needs to be level 3 weapon for this, which is 150.
[165:41.29]Good scythe!
[165:42.09]99 versus 106.
[165:50.15]Yeah, let's get it.
[165:50.65]I want it.
[165:52.15]I can't get it.
[165:52.73]God damn it.
[165:54.41]What about bludgeon?
[165:55.15]Can I do bludgeon?
[165:55.85]No, I can't.
[165:59.38]Can't even level this up.
[166:02.06]Recyclable.
[166:04.54]Box of pills.
[166:05.24]Average resale value.
[166:06.22]This item can be recycled into components.
[166:08.12]Oh, okay.
[166:08.66]Cool.
[166:10.04]Let's recycle.
[166:13.14]Codeine.
[166:14.58]Potassium.
[166:15.36]Pomegranate.
[166:18.94]Clovescence, rusty box of pills.
[166:22.66]Fuck it, man.
[166:23.20]Who cares?
[166:23.60]Is this bad for me?
[166:31.08]Am I doing something wrong?
[166:32.26]I don't know.
[166:38.66]Now let's take a look at what I can do.
[166:43.00]Nope.
[166:43.58]No lead rods.
[166:44.48]Can I level up the common machete?
[166:47.00]No.
[166:48.10]Yes, I can.
[166:48.74]Alright.
[166:49.06]I don't really want to do that, though.
[166:55.95]Let's go sports?
[166:58.19]What are you guys doing?
[167:00.49]What are you talking about?
[167:04.31]I guess I'm going to level this up and do 58, 64.
[167:09.47]That's better than what I had before.
[167:14.47]You can tell how interested everybody is in this game.
[167:17.47]Based on... Yeah, we're going to do the common machete and just get it up to 64 damage.
[167:22.92]And then I'll put the stake on.
[167:30.64]And the stake just... I can't level it up right now.
[167:36.47]Put it on.
[167:36.99]Alright, it's already on.
[167:42.87]There it is.
[167:43.17]Okay.
[167:43.29]Okay.
[167:46.81]Is the stake not equipped?
[167:50.71]It should be.
[167:53.12]Take this shit off.
[167:55.84]Okay.
[168:01.48]There we go.
[168:02.76]Excellent.
[168:04.41]Somebody wake Hydrate Bot.
[168:09.07]And scream at me.
[168:11.13]Scream at him.
[168:13.24]Alright, I gotta go find Ferocious Tartar.
[168:15.98]Quinine.
[168:17.62]And the other sodium thing.
[168:20.14]Those are located back here.
[168:21.86]Let's go do the main story mission.
[168:33.49]Bad ending incoming.
[168:36.07]What are you talking about?
[168:39.09]Honest to God.
[168:41.03]What are you talking about?
[168:47.80]Right through here.
[168:50.46]Keep an eye out for monsters.
[168:55.16]Because they are probably all over the place.
[168:58.65]In this district.
[169:01.87]Like this guy.
[169:03.09]What do you know?
[169:04.39]A monster.
[169:09.08]Cold Blood.
[169:10.28]Alright, so Right Trigger is now a new move.
[169:13.14]Let's try it.
[169:16.22]Let's see what it does.
[169:17.86]Nah, it's like a 4-10.
[169:26.59]That move is not good.
[169:32.15]Although, maybe someone that's susceptible to it might be more effective.
[169:39.57]ResidentSleeper come on guys don't Resident Evil me I Can bite this guy he is this guy's not susceptible Bite him in his neck Slash and gash this guy Do that shit
[170:10.52]I need to drink this, dude.
[170:18.15]Do we even get experience for doing this to these people?
[170:19.93]I don't think you do.
[170:24.41]Game is lame.
[170:25.79]Come on.
[170:26.99]We're just hanging out playing a game.
[170:29.53]We're just playing a game right now.
[170:30.93]That's it.
[170:31.35]We're just hanging out and playing a video game.
[170:35.47]I know I didn't burp on camera yet.
[170:44.70]Come on.
[170:48.14]Come on.
[170:54.63]The old morgue.
[170:57.99]Okay.
[171:00.63]Just play Dishonored.
[171:01.89]But this is not Dishonored.
[171:02.83]This is slow Dishonored.
[171:06.55]This is dishonored, but... Okay, this is dishonored that you captured the whole game and you dragged it into a premiere or a final cut timeline.
[171:17.73]And you just took that like 40 hours of footage and you just put it on like minus 100% speed.
[171:26.02]Turning it into like a 100 hour experience.
[171:41.23]What the hell?
[171:45.71]Do you guys really not like this this much?
[171:51.53]I'm gonna go upstairs.
[171:56.29]This has nothing to do with Dishonored.
[171:58.89]I know, I'm just pretending to be somebody in chat.
[172:02.78]I'm role-playing as a current Jerma985 Twitch chatter.
[172:10.67]Nothing else?
[172:11.13]Okay.
[172:12.27]I gotta find these various items.
[172:18.63]Would you guys rather I played Minecraft?
[172:22.55]Why did I say that?
[172:23.93]That's not gonna happen, so don't worry.
[172:29.44]Oh, you dodged.
[172:33.82]So long!
[172:35.52]Yes, you would.
[172:37.02]Actually, yes.
[172:37.74]No, you wouldn't.
[172:38.68]That's bullshit.
[172:41.60]Getting in here.
[172:42.26]He wants me to do that.
[172:43.22]In Minecraft.
[172:43.78]This is not gonna happen.
[172:44.40]Thousand percent yes.
[172:45.58]Come on.
[172:45.78]Got shotgun shells.
[172:46.64]Interesting.
[173:05.88]I'm trying.
[173:07.12]I'm just... This was a new game that came out and it looked like it could be kind of fun.
[173:14.73]Sometimes we play new games, right?
[173:16.45]Sometimes we try the new game that comes out.
[173:19.83]Even though it might not be the best thing you've ever seen.
[173:23.61]Sometimes we play the new game.
[173:35.43]I like this game.
[173:37.56]It's not that bad.
[173:47.61]I haven't found anything to be very upset about yet.
[173:50.37]You guys, well, okay, there is something there.
[173:57.89]I think there are too many people to talk to.
[173:59.39]And that's a bad thing, in my opinion.
[174:02.71]That's a very good thing for most people.
[174:04.37]But for me, it's like, I didn't... I don't want to fight monsters, man.
[174:12.27]Whoa, where'd you go?
[174:13.07]Okay.
[174:18.86]Whatever.
[174:20.26]We found the one person in chat that said they like it.
[174:27.21]That is at least... Okay.
[174:29.99]That is at least 6 out of 10 of you.
[174:34.30]That said, this was... Alright, let's get a pull here right now.
[174:40.75]How many of you think this game is barely interesting?
[174:44.79]No, that's a bad way to do it.
[174:46.35]How many of you guys think this game is fairly interesting?
[174:49.64]From fairly to barely.
[174:51.66]I'm not even... I'm paying attention to what you guys are saying.
[174:59.96]You know?
[175:00.32]Fuck it.
[175:00.70]Doesn't even matter.
[175:01.61]I'm gonna like die because of this.
[175:11.11]I need to hit this guy with a lot of attacks because he's resistant to everything.
[175:19.89]Barely.
[175:20.37]Alright, give me a second.
[175:26.46]Your interest is a solid 6 out of 10.
[175:27.86]See?
[175:34.76]And yes, I am aware that we went from the TV segment to this.
[175:42.03]Well, you know what?
[175:43.49]I can't do the TV segment again.
[175:45.21]6 out of 10 isn't good.
[175:53.60]You know, you're right, but 6... 6 out of 10.
[175:58.33]But is it though?
[175:59.19]Is it bad?
[176:03.86]I'm going to do Destroy All Humans.
[176:05.04]Now, you're going to be really upset about this.
[176:07.78]A lot of you guys that don't like what you're seeing, we were going to play Destroy All Humans tonight.
[176:12.68]That was the plan.
[176:13.86]And then I saw that Vampiro came out.
[176:17.99]And I said, you know, it's a new game.
[176:19.51]It might be a fun vampire game.
[176:22.47]And I played that in this instead.
[176:26.41]So, I know that's probably going to make a lot of people very angry.
[176:30.62]But don't worry.
[176:31.22]There's still plenty of time.
[176:34.59]To play destroy all humans.
[176:36.13]Eventually.
[176:36.65]But not right now.
[176:40.65]Okay, here we go.
[176:42.32]Examine.
[176:46.04]Ooh, use knife.
[176:48.06]You just acquired a new type of offhand weapon.
[176:49.64]Equip it with Y and directly absorb blood.
[176:54.37]That seems pretty good.
[176:55.11]Alright, that's how this guy died.
[177:00.69]New investigation.
[177:07.85]Well, alright, if this game was just point A to point B, go do the mission, then I would have a lot more negative things to say, but the little investigations, the different characters, it's... And look, maybe I'm self-justifying this livestream, but, you know, it's okay.
[177:26.15]Sometimes you need to self-justify things you're doing.
[177:30.48]There we go, I got some more famous Tartar.
[177:42.80]Last door.
[177:45.39]This could be a boss fight.
[177:48.75]Told ya.
[177:49.61]John Doe.
[177:51.75]The most generic name ever.
[177:53.11]What is he?
[177:54.33]What's he?
[177:55.43]Okay, well he has like a shadow.
[177:58.58]He's resistant to firearms, but we don't use those anyway, so... Come here, you.
[178:07.85]I don't want to give him a shadow move.
[178:14.48]Do I have to kill a shadow, too?
[178:23.13]Being weird.
[178:28.03]I can't.
[178:28.33]I want to stun him.
[178:30.75]I didn't stun him, actually.
[178:34.85]Forget the stun.
[178:37.11]That fucking died, though.
[178:42.31]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[179:02.26]Don't get greedy.
[179:03.14]Don't get greedy.
[179:05.46]That's greedy.
[179:12.45]Ooh, got it.
[179:18.22]Ooh, fight him.
[179:21.08]End it with a blood attack.
[179:21.96]See you later.
[179:22.64]One, two, three, goodbye.
[179:28.68]These skulls can be so ferocious.
[179:32.06]I'm not sure I can defeat them without becoming stronger.
[179:36.86]To drink blood is so tempting.
[179:39.84]The problem is Minecraft.
[179:44.52]This chat, somebody just came in and said, this chat is fucking awful.
[179:55.36]What the, what's happening?
[179:59.39]I just want to roleplay as a- as a- I gotta call the treatment center for fatigue.
[180:06.40]I don't even know what to say.
[180:12.22]Everything's fine.
[180:13.92]Alright, we're just having fun.
[180:16.29]We're having a good time.
[180:19.15]We're having a great time.
[180:20.17]And everybody here, as you might- the chat is just having a fun- they're just doing this thing where they just have fun and they pretend like they don't like what they see.
[180:31.03]treatment for fatigue right here and see some of these shatters some of them give 50 bucks like flank tank flank tank divine pretend uh hold on first of all thank you flank tank for the 100 bucks tonight thank you so much dude
[180:58.59]I was just pretending to be bored.
[181:00.77]Thank you, dude.
[181:03.19]5,000 bits.
[181:03.43]Hey, Jeremy, me again.
[181:05.15]Remember that Patch Notes vacation vlog video you made a while ago?
[181:08.72]I used to live in an apartment across the road from where you were standing on the beach filming that video.
[181:14.38]Really?
[181:15.90]Uh, St.
[181:16.52]Pete's Beach, right?
[181:18.02]I recognize the round, white hotel building that's in the background that's on the last few frames.
[181:23.11]When I saw it, I almost shit my pants.
[181:25.23]When are we gonna see more vacation vlogs?
[181:28.76]Um, yeah, that's correct.
[181:30.42]That was at St.
[181:31.08]Pete.
[181:32.70]That's very perceptive of you.
[181:35.10]Uh, vacation vlogs.
[181:38.55]I should just, like, fucking do it now.
[181:41.07]Just go out in the darkness and go combat the bug that's out there.
[181:49.92]It's chilly in here.
[181:54.03]But, no, that's pretty interesting, though.
[181:56.75]From, like, two frames of the video, you can tell.
[182:00.45]I got attacked by a bird on that beach.
[182:03.07]Not really, though.
[182:03.59]I lied.
[182:06.23]I got, like, barely attacked by a bird.
[182:07.79]I just, like, was filming a bird, and it got, like, mad at me, and it flew at me.
[182:12.09]I'm fine.
[182:12.71]I didn't get hurt or anything.
[182:17.55]Alright.
[182:17.97]So, thanks.
[182:19.97]I wasn't technically a lie.
[182:21.18]That was a truth stretch.
[182:23.46]Do you understand?
[182:24.02]There's two different things there.
[182:28.35]And thank you, NoStars, for the 10 bucks here as well.
[182:33.77]Glad I could finally catch a live stream.
[182:35.03]Enjoyed the PS2 stream, especially Raw Danger, but this was a great one.
[182:39.54]Calling it a night.
[182:40.88]Looking forward to watching the VOD.
[182:42.24]Hey, thanks, man.
[182:43.60]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[182:44.34]Thanks for sticking around.
[182:47.42]Appreciate that.
[182:47.94]Alright, I can rest now.
[182:50.42]Time to go back.
[182:56.07]This is a good game, but it's not good stream material.
[183:00.35]Yeah, but we've already made our porridge, so we have to put our face in it.
[183:03.94]You know what I mean?
[183:05.02]Bullets.
[183:10.94]I already made dinner for you guys.
[183:13.60]So, what, am I just gonna throw the dinner in the trash?
[183:17.16]I'm not gonna start over and make new dinner.
[183:19.28]Like, you get what I make.
[183:20.44]You know what I'm saying?
[183:24.71]When you guys eat, like when your mother makes you baked potatoes and bacon-wrapped scallops, are you gonna be like, oh, thanks for making me food, mom.
[183:35.69]Uh, yeah, alright, um, I want something else.
[183:39.49]Make me, make me a pizza instead.
[183:43.31]Excuse me?
[183:44.35]I don't want vegetables.
[183:58.72]I gotta go upstairs, I think.
[184:02.16]I micro- Yeah, but sometimes your mom doesn't make the best dinner.
[184:05.34]That's what I'm saying.
[184:06.62]So, if I took, like, a Lean Cuisine out of the box, and I microwaved it, and that's, like, that's what I had time for today.
[184:14.37]Mom's a busy gal.
[184:16.45]You know?
[184:17.17]She's all over the place.
[184:17.97]She's doing errands.
[184:19.11]She didn't have time.
[184:19.93]Oh, I forgot about- I got dinner.
[184:21.51]I gotta make dinner.
[184:22.37]And you get a microwave Lean Cuisine?
[184:26.03]Come on.
[184:26.87]Sometimes it happens.
[184:30.06]You can't just, like, knock it out of my hand when I bring it in to you and say, um, this is not a crispy buffalo chicken pizza.
[184:39.65]Where is my crispy buffalo chicken pizza, Mom?
[184:43.07]Well, it's, you know, you can't just demand food from Mom.
[184:46.22]Mom works a fucking lot and has a hard life.
[184:49.48]Okay?
[184:50.62]So sometimes, sometimes you don't get a crispy buffalo chicken pizza.
[184:54.30]Sometimes you have to eat the fucking Lee Cuisine.
[184:57.89]So eat it!
[185:00.01]Otherwise, you're gonna starve!
[185:11.24]Where's Minecraft?
[185:26.36]Mom, no.
[185:28.83]I'm not even in the right place.
[185:30.37]Okay, somebody gave $100.
[185:33.07]So guess what?
[185:33.63]Now mom can afford to go get the crispy buffalo chicken pizza.
[185:40.24]Thank you, YFT1, for the $100.
[185:41.28]10,000 bits.
[185:47.76]Thank you so much, man.
[185:49.90]And they say, Jerma, if you made me a burger, what would you make?
[185:53.02]And if you play PS2 games again, I highly recommend Castlevania Curse of Darkness.
[185:58.29]There are 4,000 PlayStation 2 games.
[185:59.97]We're never going to get to the end of that.
[186:01.01]I thought about this the other day.
[186:03.39]And we're going to have to spread that out.
[186:08.00]There are so many of them.
[186:09.72]I'm going to be 50 by the time we're done with all those games.
[186:15.70]But I definitely will give it a look.
[186:18.06]Please remind me.
[186:19.58]Go to the Discord and put it in the recommendations channel.
[186:22.24]Because I'm... My brain is so scattered that that's a great place to put it.
[186:28.49]But if I made you a burger, it would be very, very simple.
[186:33.69]Here's what it would be.
[186:35.11]Toasted buns.
[186:36.05]Sesame seed buns, by the way.
[186:38.27]None of this, like, backyard barbecue bag bun bullshit.
[186:43.70]that a lot of people like.
[186:44.40]You know what I'm talking about?
[186:45.04]The ones with like the squished ass buns.
[186:46.76]Why do you buy those?
[186:48.34]Get the real, fluffy, sesame seed buns.
[186:53.63]I would put that on the grill and I would toast it.
[186:54.97]Don't leave it on the grill for more than fucking two minutes.
[186:57.57]Take it off.
[186:57.89]It doesn't need to be burnt.
[187:06.66]And that's it.
[187:07.04]That's what you get.
[187:07.76]You get grilled toast.
[187:09.26]That's what I would make you.
[187:12.83]No.
[187:13.01]Alright, so then the patty goes on.
[187:17.05]Where the fuck is this?
[187:18.05]It's upstairs.
[187:18.57]Alright, patty goes on the grill.
[187:22.55]Not for too long.
[187:23.19]You don't want to have it on there for like more of the... I'd say like maybe... You want it like a medium... I like my burgers medium well.
[187:30.92]None of this backyard barbecue green inside hamburger bullshit.
[187:34.54]You know when like you cook it and it gets green in the middle?
[187:37.49]Because mom works a lot and mom can't afford the fucking expensive Angus beef?
[187:42.80]No, I don't like it like red in the middle.
[187:45.04]It'll be a little pink in the middle.
[187:46.64]Medium, medium well.
[187:50.26]And then from there, I would probably put maybe like a little bit of fresh iceberg lettuce.
[187:54.76]Sprinkle.
[187:55.52]Shred it up.
[187:55.94]Because when you bite into a hamburger and there's a huge leaf of lettuce, sometimes it just pulls the whole thing out and ruins all the condiments.
[188:03.23]All the condiments are on the top of the leaf.
[188:05.47]Get that backyard barbecue bullshit out of here.
[188:09.93]Sprinkle the iceberg lettuce.
[188:13.81]And then, I would drizzle a little bit of garlic aioli on that bun.
[188:18.32]Not enough to make you sick, but enough to make you feel like you're eating it.
[188:23.24]Unless you wanted more.
[188:26.58]And then, from there, I would put one slab of applewood smoked bacon.
[188:33.67]Cut it in half, not the whole strip, because then you bite into it, you pull the whole fucking strip out.
[188:37.57]No, sliced in half, one, two, on either side of the bun.
[188:44.11]And then you would eat it, and you would think it was great.
[188:45.61]And a little bit of mayo!
[188:46.25]A little bit of mayo, too.
[188:47.01]That's part of the garlic aioli sauce.
[188:50.15]I just got more money.
[188:52.53]What am I doing here?
[188:54.34]Hold on.
[188:54.80]Somebody gave- Craft a treatment for- Didn't I do that?
[188:59.64]Apparently not.
[189:02.00]Uh, thank you, Peter.
[189:03.66]That's not your name.
[189:04.36]It's P337R.
[189:06.84]I'm gonna- That's definitely Peter.
[189:09.97]No cheese?
[189:10.53]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[189:11.61]I forgot about the cheese.
[189:13.11]The cheese would be a very, very sharp cheddar.
[189:17.86]We're talking like a Sour Patch Kid in your mouth.
[189:20.80]Sharp.
[189:21.50]You put that in and... Ooh!
[189:24.04]Sour!
[189:24.52]Fucking... You know, I love hard, sharp cheeses.
[189:29.93]So what you do is you take that piece of cheese, you put it on the grill.
[189:32.55]Don't put it on the bun.
[189:33.27]Put it right on the grill.
[189:35.23]And wait till you can start to see it start to turn, like, start to melt.
[189:38.39]Once the skin starts melting on that cheese, flip the cheese.
[189:42.96]And then it'll get to the other side.
[189:43.92]You get a nice char on the back of that cheese, both sides.
[189:46.86]It's gonna be really goopy and drippy.
[189:48.12]You pick that up right on top.
[189:50.52]Grilled cheese.
[189:58.52]Yeah, right on the grill.
[190:01.81]I cannot enter.
[190:04.57]I can't go in there.
[190:07.76]How?
[190:08.96]You gotta be quick.
[190:10.48]Put it down.
[190:11.58]One.
[190:12.36]Two.
[190:13.14]Three.
[190:13.40]Flip.
[190:14.10]One.
[190:14.86]Two.
[190:15.74]Three.
[190:16.30]Off.
[190:16.88]Onto the bun.
[190:19.97]How do I get in here?
[190:20.65]It's locked, alright.
[190:24.77]The grilled cheese is not a burger.
[190:26.55]No.
[190:26.99]A grilled cheese that has been put on the grill.
[190:30.59]It's down...
[190:34.93]You'll mess it up once or twice, but it's alright.
[190:36.61]And by the way, this will ruin your grill.
[190:39.16]Don't do that.
[190:41.30]Put it on the bun.
[190:45.40]You will fuck up your grill if you do that, so please don't do that.
[190:48.25]It was just a prescribed Dr. Acula joke.
[190:51.11]Alright, we got a medicine here.
[190:55.37]But...
[190:59.77]Uh, Peter.
[191:00.13]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[191:01.09]He didn't even read it.
[191:01.75]I'm home on it.
[191:02.07]Vits.
[191:02.19]Missed the vits.
[191:02.85]Hold on.
[191:03.09]There's people talking in my ear right now.
[191:04.29]You understand?
[191:04.77]I can't just, like, talk.
[191:07.35]Thoughts on tomato and grilled cheese sandwiches?
[191:09.81]Disgusting, and I'll tell you one reason.
[191:11.25]When you cook tomatoes...
[191:25.27]absolutely fucking revolting.
[191:26.89]They turn to mush, and it makes me want to throw up when I take a bite.
[191:30.13]So, give you a tip here.
[191:32.73]Make the grilled cheese.
[191:34.43]Put that on, you know, sear it in a pan, you know, put it on both sides, a little bit of butter.
[191:38.56]Take the slice of tomato, put it right on the grill.
[191:41.44]Right on the grill.
[191:42.50]Do not cook it in the sandwich.
[191:43.72]It gets salty and gross.
[191:45.10]Flip it over, 25 seconds.
[191:46.82]Get the nice charred marks on that slice of tomato.
[191:52.10]and put it on don't do that the grilled cheese with tomato is disgusting because people put the cut they put it together they don't cook it separately and it turns to shit but thank you anyways to Peter for the 50 bucks uh don't worry Jerma we understand that sometimes you have to be boring sponsored streams like this we've all got bills to pay we support you either way are people getting paid to play this game they're not are they
[192:21.06]Is this like the new sponsored video game stream that people do?
[192:25.72]I don't think it is.
[192:26.50]Is it?
[192:26.70]I didn't even look.
[192:28.44]It is.
[192:30.05]No, it's not.
[192:36.25]How many streams today did you see that said sponsored in the title?
[192:40.33]I didn't look.
[192:43.07]I don't think that's the case.
[192:44.61]And if it is, then fuck.
[192:46.69]I didn't get paid to play this.
[192:53.19]No, this is not sponsored.
[192:54.15]Why would I don't do that?
[192:58.03]I don't I don't do that.
[193:02.55]I don't play games because somebody fucking told me to.
[193:11.10]This wasn't everybody's fucking thing to this.
[193:14.36]Enough of this backyard barbecue bullshit, OK?
[193:20.33]And by the way, speaking of backyard barbecues, I know, I know all of you do this.
[193:25.55]I know it because I've been to every barbecue that you've ever been to.
[193:28.96]Stop it.
[193:29.86]Stop going to the frozen section of your grocery store and buying the frozen fucking hamburger patties that have the paper on them.
[193:38.35]Stop doing that.
[193:40.15]I know.
[193:40.47]I know like drunk Uncle Larry can put like 30 of those on the grill and who cares if they're gross.
[193:47.78]But just step in.
[193:49.88]Next time, step in and be like, Larry, the wax paper frozen hamburgers from the grocery store.
[193:58.77]Can you stop doing this?
[194:00.85]And he's probably going to, you're going to give him an epiphany.
[194:02.72]You're going to blow his mind when you tell him that there are other options out there.
[194:09.98]Step in there.
[194:10.63]Put your face in the grill.
[194:11.75]No, don't do that.
[194:13.57]Just put your face right in the fire and be like, Larry!
[194:16.33]Larry, you see?
[194:21.41]Anyways, thank you so much, Peter.
[194:23.35]Let's continue playing the game.
[194:27.63]He's from Boston and has an opinion on barbecue.
[194:31.53]What?
[194:32.23]You guys realize?
[194:32.99]Okay, Mr. Barbecue.
[194:35.46]Bobby Flay.
[194:37.71]Your favorite grilling man.
[194:39.87]The guy that wrote all the cookbooks for grilling.
[194:41.69]All the most respected grill cook in America.
[194:44.31]You know where he's from?
[194:45.75]Where do you think he's from?
[194:47.83]Hmm.
[194:49.41]You have to be from a certain area, apparently, to know how to barbecue.
[194:52.56]Did you write like 12 cookbooks on grilling as Bobby Flay?
[194:56.32]Massachusetts boy?
[195:02.72]Wait a minute, what?
[195:07.08]Bobby Flay.
[195:13.65]Bobby Flay Bobby Flay early life Hold on a second quiet quiet quiet
[195:40.85]Hold on.
[195:41.21]Alright.
[195:41.55]So, we made a mistake.
[195:43.51]I'm thinking of Emeril Lagasse.
[195:44.97]Okay?
[195:45.37]He's from Massachusetts.
[195:47.01]He grilled on that show once.
[195:49.49]Emeril Lagasse.
[195:50.61]Emeril is the one that's from Massachusetts.
[195:53.47]That's who I'm thinking of.
[195:54.51]They're all the same person.
[195:55.70]You watch the same fucking show.
[195:57.04]They all do the same show.
[195:58.32]So, it doesn't matter.
[195:58.94]Alright.
[196:04.82]They all blend together.
[196:05.60]You guys don't know who Emeril is?
[196:08.36]Are you kidding me?
[196:10.68]That makes me sad.
[196:11.34]That you guys don't know who Emeril is.
[196:17.10]What were we doing?
[196:18.93]The point is, Bobby Flay is from New York City.
[196:22.19]He's at... You tell... He's the... We don't even have to go back.
[196:25.37]Let's just... Diseases... Spread diseases with blood quality.
[196:30.93]Okay.
[196:32.51]Rat in the hospital.
[196:35.84]Emeril is from, like, 20 years ago?
[196:37.28]Yeah, he's the reason why Food Network has any viewers.
[196:40.86]The reason why anybody on that entire network has a career is because Emeril existed.
[196:52.91]Remember, citizens' blood will provide you a massive XP boost.
[196:57.36]Look for citizens of your mesmerized level or below and choose wisely.
[197:02.46]I mean, you probably...
[197:07.53]It really just wants me to start.
[197:08.81]I'm just going to start eating people.
[197:10.22]Like this guy.
[197:10.94]Who cares?
[197:12.28]Good evening, sir.
[197:13.86]I'm Dr. Reed.
[197:15.42]May I help you?
[197:16.24]I don't know if a third opinion is needed.
[197:18.78]Emeril's from Fall River, not Boston.
[197:20.50]I said Massachusetts.
[197:22.91]I see.
[197:24.53]Would you mind telling me more about your situation?
[197:26.09]He's from Massachusetts.
[197:26.95]I'm Harvey Fiddick.
[197:28.57]All I want is to get my bloody arm fixed properly.
[197:31.65]But anyways, that answers your question.
[197:32.52]That's what I would make for you for a burger.
[197:35.11]And then Valentoria, thank you for the ten bucks.
[197:36.81]If you had to cook a human, how would you do it?
[197:38.46]Also, please call me a pony.
[197:42.60]A pretty pony.
[197:43.68]Okay.
[197:43.78]I just did.
[197:44.50]I'm not going to cook a person.
[197:55.61]Doctors are no different from carpenters, it seems.
[197:58.13]What do you mean?
[197:59.01]I often had professional arguments with rivals on a building site.
[198:02.98]Differences are disagreed about wooden nails, not flesh and bones.
[198:08.20]You know the human when their skin's taken off in your biology class?
[198:12.58]And you see just how weird looking the muscle tissue is and the fiber.
[198:15.19]I feel like humans would be very stringy.
[198:16.71]I wouldn't even want to touch them.
[198:19.49]Tell me about yourself, Mr. Fiddick.
[198:21.22]I'm just a regular guy waiting to get his arm fixed so I can return to work and to my family.
[198:27.06]I was more curious about what you were doing before being hospitalized.
[198:30.64]I'm a carpenter, and a good one, too.
[198:33.10]That was a quick response.
[198:34.41]But that means I need both arms to feed my family, Dr. Lee.
[198:38.11]He sent me that eight minutes ago.
[198:39.51]Alright, let's... Let's see if I got 500 experience.
[198:45.91]It's free food.
[198:46.55]Let's just eat it.
[198:52.80]Do a barbecue stream?
[198:57.72]I could do a barbecue stream and show you guys some tricks.
[199:04.12]Although, a barbecue stream might turn into something else.
[199:16.29]Barbecue.
[199:26.09]You bet I can't even cook?
[199:28.17]There's a lot of things I can do that you guys don't know about.
[199:32.60]Never seen me juggle, but why would I tell you I could do that?
[199:35.84]Pretty cameo.
[199:37.26]That's bullshit?
[199:37.92]Bullshit.
[199:55.19]Bullshit, they all say.
[199:57.21]Okay.
[200:09.70]One, two, three.
[200:10.90]Get the fuck out of here.
[200:18.27]Who fucking cares?
[200:20.25]Juggling.
[200:21.57]A skill that...
[200:23.86]Became irrelevant 40 years ago.
[200:25.76]No one's gonna pay you to do that.
[200:35.64]Gotta go upstairs.
[200:43.24]So funny.
[200:44.52]It's locked.
[200:44.82]I'm gonna go upstairs.
[200:45.70]Do I have level 2 already?
[200:53.75]Good evening, Miss Howcroft.
[200:55.11]Level two.
[200:55.73]How are you doing?
[200:56.61]Not well.
[200:57.89]Eternity can be such a burden.
[201:00.57]ADHD streamer plays story games.
[201:02.75]Mr. Elwood.
[201:03.39]That's different, though, because we played a story game last week.
[201:06.86]And I was completely involved.
[201:10.14]Detroit Become Human could be the whole thing.
[201:13.82]Why she's... She is a vampire.
[201:16.42]She's not speaking.
[201:21.83]And what exactly have you learned about me?
[201:24.57]You try to be a decent man, Dr. Reed.
[201:27.41]And you're trying to make a difference.
[201:28.51]Can you talk to every character?
[201:29.49]It seems like you can.
[201:30.24]That's more than most mortals I've ever met.
[201:31.88]That's quite a statement, Miss Harcroft.
[201:34.26]But there is more, isn't there?
[201:35.74]That's why it's kind of overwhelming.
[201:37.00]Your interest for my condition?
[201:39.34]Your subtle innuendos.
[201:42.06]Are you... Are we the same, Doctor?
[201:48.76]Uh, one vampire in this hospital isn't enough.
[201:50.92]I think one vampire in this hospital is quite enough.
[201:54.44]For once I sense real honesty in your voice, Dr. Reed.
[201:59.49]Somehow that frightens me.
[202:00.83]Hmm.
[202:04.89]Do you think about Thomas's death sometimes?
[202:07.59]Every night.
[202:08.09]I didn't want to kill him.
[202:11.01]I liked him.
[202:12.73]Now people will hunt him down.
[202:16.59]Hey, you're safe.
[202:17.25]You're safe as long as you stay in the hospital.
[202:20.67]No one will hunt you here, I promise.
[202:22.81]These walls will not protect me, Doctor.
[202:25.61]They will never forget the crime I've done.
[202:28.48]And nor will I. Guy will protect you.
[202:33.12]You are a patient here, Miss Howcroft.
[202:35.88]Someone with real needs who deserves peace and treatment.
[202:37.76]Why is there a voice coming from your mouth?
[202:39.38]What are you talking about?
[202:40.70]I will protect you.
[202:42.81]Don't be ridiculous, Doctor.
[202:45.08]How could a mortal carry all the pain of the world on his shoulders?
[202:48.48]Hank is still dead.
[202:49.90]I should be far more cautious.
[202:52.98]You're no murderer.
[202:53.66]You're no murderer, trust me.
[202:56.32]Only a fool would believe otherwise.
[202:58.71]How long before other mortals start hunting me?
[203:01.61]As always, blood is the only price for blood.
[203:06.51]Okay.
[203:10.19]Do you require my services, Miss Howcroft?
[203:12.41]I have no need for your medicine, Dr. Reed.
[203:15.85]Blood is the only drug I need.
[203:20.96]Any more personal questions?
[203:22.48]Do you want to ask me something?
[203:23.94]Judging by the look in your eyes, there is something you want to ask me, Miss Hawkins.
[203:28.79]Listen to my voice, Jonathan.
[203:30.97]You can't refuse to answer my questions.
[203:33.98]Speak now.
[203:35.24]Tell me about you and that fancy red-headed lady.
[203:41.74]Don't resist me.
[203:43.59]Answer now, Doctor.
[203:45.13]What's really going on between you two?
[203:50.57]I love her.
[203:51.29]I love her.
[203:52.37]I love her dearly.
[203:54.31]It's that simple.
[203:55.42]Now, Jonathan, I want you to forget we had this little conversation.
[204:00.06]I don't know who that is.
[204:01.28]You can get back to what you were doing.
[204:07.29]I'll leave you, mistress of the dark.
[204:08.79]The second I get two mesmerizations, I am draining.
[204:17.67]Alright, we gotta go upstairs.
[204:21.21]I have a lot of points, too, so... Can I just teleport up there?
[204:25.45]Where are the stairs?
[204:26.87]There they are, you dummy.
[204:33.35]You.
[204:34.39]My office.
[204:35.45]Now.
[204:37.95]Speaking of which... This game is draining me.
[204:44.13]Well, it's alright.
[204:45.39]I'm not going to be streaming for that much longer anyways.
[204:52.85]Not there.
[204:55.13]Level up first.
[204:55.79]No, I've got to do this.
[204:58.85]Where the fuck are you?
[205:04.59]What hallway?
[205:05.37]What door?
[205:05.97]Where are you?
[205:06.36]Right here.
[205:09.06]Please, Jonathan.
[205:10.32]Come in.
[205:13.10]Let him enjoy his vampire game.
[205:14.74]Paid streamer makes viewers suffer.
[205:15.90]Fascinating, is it not?
[205:17.56]In the last decade, so many mysteries have been brought to light with our microscopes.
[205:22.92]The human body, biology's penultimate frontier.
[205:28.46]The more we explore its boundaries, the less we are able to trace a clear line between life and death.
[205:34.24]time for the after stream soon you my friend have a foot in both countries the view must be vertiginous it's at least as vertiginous as chatting about vampires with you I would say I don't want to see your weighted pull this must be all so new to you
[205:49.74]This area of town, the hospital, a brand new life?
[205:53.36]How stimulating it must be.
[205:54.48]My uncle works for Twitch.
[205:55.40]You're fucking dumb.
[205:55.84]I wish I could share your enthusiasm, Dr. Swansea, but my condition defies scientific categorization.
[206:02.13]No, I'm going to be fine.
[206:02.91]I've never shown my asshole on stream, so I'll be alright.
[206:06.31]Immortality defies logic.
[206:09.01]That's the criteria.
[206:09.75]I cannot express my thrill at this serendipitous turn of events.
[206:13.43]The world's most eminent specialist in blood transfusions, a vampire.
[206:18.08]Sure.
[206:18.32]I'm a living paradox.
[206:19.40]Yet.
[206:21.62]Yet.
[206:21.92]God damn, man.
[206:23.90]You guys are... You guys are... You guys are savage tonight.
[206:48.68]I'm not some doe-eyed student, Edgar.
[206:51.82]I understand we both have something to gain from this relationship.
[206:57.23]Very well.
[206:58.69]I have a task for you, Jonathan.
[207:00.73]Something that will require all your newfound skills.
[207:03.69]You guys are getting really unruly.
[207:05.67]Go on.
[207:06.99]The Pembroke only survives through the generosity of our benefactors.
[207:11.27]Unfortunately, our main donor has found herself in a bit of a bind.
[207:15.28]Now, if you could help her out...
[207:18.52]A spokesman or politician is what you need.
[207:21.66]That's not my calling.
[207:23.54]And until I come to understand what has happened to me, I require discretion.
[207:27.57]I'm going to click the poll.
[207:28.97]Discretion is in order, Jonathan.
[207:31.43]Lady Ashtray has recently received rather indelicate correspondence that, if revealed, would jeopardize her position.
[207:39.83]And you would like me to eradicate this threat?
[207:44.08]By the stole, of course not.
[207:46.16]I would just like you to pay her a visit.
[207:48.91]her ladyship is certainly near the tents outside tending the sick you can't miss her look for someone impossibly delicate accepted I'll see what kind of trouble lady ashbury is in okay hold on what the hell let me see what the hell you guys are linking me here what is this
[208:14.13]Let's take a look at the results here.
[208:15.41]Okay, this is, should Jerma continue playing this garbage game or play a good game like Minecraft?
[208:22.63]Play Minecraft, bad game, the one being played now.
[208:28.17]65, I didn't make this poll.
[208:31.83]I didn't decide this was the poll.
[208:39.04]You guys are talking about this is some kind of actual democracy here.
[208:44.52]I didn't make that.
[208:47.10]I mean, this is a democracy, but we're not holding an election right now.
[208:53.33]What election did I... I am the president of this current state, and I didn't say to start an election.
[209:01.85]I've only been streaming for like two and a half years, three years.
[209:05.07]Four years isn't up yet.
[209:07.46]I get four years of this, and then you guys get to decide.
[209:20.11]That's how it works.
[209:21.39]You chose me.
[209:24.87]Look, I told you this, you can only impeach me if I've shown my asshole on stream and I haven't done that.
[209:30.87]Your impeachment, your cries for impeachment can't be justified.
[209:35.71]You know what?
[209:36.07]You can hire your special investigation.
[209:37.89]They're not going to find it.
[209:38.87]You're not going to find one picture of my asshole on this stream.
[209:43.17]No matter how much you search for it.
[209:48.31]I need to go to sleep.
[209:49.85]Not in the game, but in the level up.
[209:58.38]That was on YouTube.
[210:00.14]YouTube is a different country.
[210:02.02]Yes, I was a president of a different country.
[210:05.16]So.
[210:07.66]And look, that country, that country went down the tubes.
[210:11.12]Okay?
[210:12.08]After I was on that country, I was part of that country, I lived there, and I was the president of that country.
[210:17.96]Second I leave that country, the whole thing collapses.
[210:21.14]So I'm not going back to that country.
[210:25.92]I want... What do I want?
[210:31.35]I'm going to level this up.
[210:32.25]1800.
[210:32.47]That's so much.
[210:35.11]Let's do health again.
[210:37.87]Yeah.
[210:38.31]Health again.
[210:44.46]Now I got level 1 bite.
[210:49.30]No ultimate yet.
[210:51.32]Shadow Mist.
[210:52.82]Let's get this up to level 2 if I can.
[210:54.18]2000.
[210:54.20]What about this?
[210:54.89]1000. 1000.
[211:05.83]More regeneration.
[211:07.29]Three serums.
[211:07.99]Number of bullets.
[211:11.39]Big Thirst.
[211:13.17]Maybe I'll do Big Thirst again.
[211:15.03]Yeah, let's get it up there.
[211:19.22]Can do it again.
[211:19.78]Let's do... Let's get Endurance up to level two.
[211:29.17]Literally still playing the game.
[211:36.96]You don't have to play popular games for us to like you.
[211:39.34]I wanted to play this.
[211:43.48]Alright, hold on a second.
[211:44.98]I am... Do I get my rebuttal?
[211:47.55]Do I get... I get my rebuttal, right?
[211:49.41]If we're doing a debate here and it's everybody versus me, I get my time to speak.
[211:55.09]I don't... I never play new games.
[211:57.53]I play like new releases like three or four times a year.
[212:03.09]Come on.
[212:04.31]I get my rebuttal here.
[212:10.50]I play, like, the new games, like, once a month.
[212:18.30]And a couple of new games came out, and here we go.
[212:22.10]The flower's dying.
[212:24.38]It needs water.
[212:25.46]Detroit, yeah, but Detroit, come on, you guys didn't like that Detroit was fun.
[212:28.43]I liked Detroit.
[212:29.19]Detroit was cool.
[212:30.97]Fuck, that means I don't like this.
[212:33.27]No, I don't not like this.
[212:40.89]Because good games only come out once a month.
[212:49.26]The Supreme Court.
[212:51.74]Chat versus me.
[212:52.86]Ah, I see.
[212:58.73]Yeah, Detroit is a movie, not a game.
[213:04.71]Remember the joke I made about this?
[213:06.29]Well, didn't you like that one?
[213:10.20]Remember the things we've done in this stream?
[213:12.46]Look at the things we've done.
[213:15.16]Good evening, sir.
[213:17.02]I'm Dr. Jonathan Reed.
[213:18.54]I'm new here.
[213:19.36]I've already heard about you, Dr. Reed.
[213:21.44]I'm Milton Hooks, the ambulance driver for this shithole of a hospital.
[213:25.21]That's quite a blunt introduction, Mr. Hooks.
[213:27.77]You can call me Milton.
[213:29.31]I like to speak my mind, Dr. Reed.
[213:31.11]Perk of the job.
[213:32.23]Don't judge me, and I won't judge you.
[213:34.17]I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about.
[213:36.97]Well, I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure a gun can't be used as a surgical instrument.
[213:41.19]You have a keen eye.
[213:43.66]I learned to shoot during the war and have carried one ever since.
[213:48.12]Old habits die hard.
[213:49.56]No need to explain, Dr. Reed.
[213:51.64]And if you ever need a better gun, remember, I may have something for you.
[213:55.44]What's my beef with actually good games?
[213:58.84]I don't have a problem with this game.
[214:00.72]I don't have a problem with this game.
[214:03.79]I have some good news, Milton.
[214:06.43]The epidemic's over.
[214:07.62]I retrieved your wallet with all the money and a certain picture.
[214:12.50]Well, yeah, Pippa Hawkins is my girl.
[214:15.00]So what?
[214:16.58]Is it the difference of skin color that bothers you?
[214:19.03]Not at all, Milton.
[214:20.27]Good.
[214:21.83]Take this money anyway to remind you to keep your mouth shut.
[214:25.65]Not everybody's as broad-minded as you, Dr. Reed.
[214:29.92]40 bucks.
[214:31.04]Hey, why don't we have a little bit of a trade there?
[214:32.74]I'll give it back to you for a good gun.
[214:34.86]Wise choice, Dr. Reed.
[214:36.60]A reliable gun is what everybody needs these days.
[214:39.42]I gotta go pee.
[214:41.88]Yeah, I'm... Milton's shotgun is 350.
[214:44.64]Can't afford it, but I'm gonna pee.
[214:46.90]Let me pee.
[214:47.74]I'm gonna get another drink of hydration.
[214:49.88]I'm gonna come back.
[214:51.30]And we'll play this for a little bit longer, and then we'll hang out.
[214:54.33]I... Just wait.
[214:56.87]I'll be right back.
[214:57.81]Then we're gonna calm down.
[215:13.31]Hey.
[215:13.47]What do you mean joke?
[215:17.47]What are you talking about?
[215:23.23]Spencer demanded new game.
[215:25.73]Twitch staff riots against streamer.
[215:31.19]No, I... I'm getting like revolted against.
[215:37.85]You guys are revolting against me right now.
[215:40.83]I don't have anything.
[215:41.71]What else am I supposed to do?
[215:43.85]I already told you I made the dinner.
[215:46.22]I can't just throw it in the trash.
[215:47.58]Hold on.
[215:56.76]No, I'm playing this for... I'm doing one more mission.
[216:03.39]Yeah.
[216:05.49]Goddamn.
[216:12.19]I'm doing one more mission and then we'll wind down and we'll just hang out.
[216:19.88]We'll go for like four hours.
[216:21.20]That'll be a four hour, five hour stream here.
[216:26.86]And then we'll be done.
[216:32.75]uh weird crystals I don't want it no no time for dessert it's safer than anywhere else in the east end you don't eat dessert first the flu took my dear wife Emily I take comfort knowing we'll soon be together again Mr. rainfield there's no way to talk you're in good hands here and we'll be up again soon enough
[217:03.02]I want wax burgers.
[217:04.72]You don't want that.
[217:05.56]The paper gets on it, and when it gets... Now do me a kindness and give some sleep.
[217:08.96]I'll be back around later.
[217:10.97]Your words are kind, the blessings of an angel.
[217:14.19]You're the sweet, sweet lady of mercy.
[217:22.82]Good evening, Dr. Reed.
[217:24.76]It's a pleasure to see you again.
[217:27.21]You seemed surprised.
[217:29.55]Dr. Swansea has brought me up to speed concerning your recent appointment to Pembroke Hospital.
[217:36.95]Yorub, I'm the lady who saved me that night.
[217:40.03]I thought the audio just turned off.
[217:41.09]Before vanishing into thin air.
[217:44.14]I remember you from the pub with Dr. Swansea.
[217:47.34]Indeed.
[217:49.14]Allow me to introduce myself formally.
[217:51.50]That is true.
[217:52.41]I can pull out Bane.
[217:53.27]My name is Lady Ashbury.
[217:55.15]I could pull Bane out of my hat here and really cause a problem.
[217:58.38]In spite of the brevity of our encounter.
[218:04.22]Oh, I feel played.
[218:05.80]Don't make me do it.
[218:06.50]Don't make me start it.
[218:08.70]I will.
[218:10.14]You're gonna enjoy this?
[218:10.86]You're gonna enjoy the last, like, 20 minutes of this?
[218:13.94]Or am I gonna have to do it?
[218:28.28]You must have countless questions, but our rather urgent matter first.
[218:33.44]Swansea has explained.
[218:35.64]My cover, if you prefer, has been compromised.
[218:40.23]Dr. Swansea has commissioned me to be your agent in this matter.
[218:47.36]You could start by explaining what's amiss.
[218:50.92]These past insufferable weeks.
[218:52.98]I had to move this TV.
[218:54.16]I've been the victim of extortion.
[218:56.01]This is so big.
[218:57.47]I've made a first payment, but the blackmailer grows greedy.
[219:01.55]I must refuse his most recent demands.
[219:06.79]Please continue.
[219:08.29]Every detail is essential.
[219:10.91]I'm your man.
[219:12.57]My embarrassment in this matter is eclipsed only by my shame at having put the hospital at risk.
[219:17.63]I didn't think it was that bad.
[219:19.96]The threat from our anonymous scoundrel is clear.
[219:22.78]A list of dates.
[219:25.10]My visits coinciding with the dates of suspicious patient deaths due to massive blood loss.
[219:35.40]I'll take care of it.
[219:37.50]Do you know where I should start?
[219:39.81]If that was the case, I'd settle the matter myself.
[219:43.17]Imagine if the TV fell on me and I couldn't do the rest of the streams.
[219:47.87]Not a pin drops here without her hearing about it.
[219:51.47]I'll meet that woman now.
[219:53.85]My life, as others know, is in your hands, Dr. Reed.
[219:59.49]I'm sure of your discretion, but I do fear your powers of persuasion will be put to the test.
[220:07.28]When this is resolved, I'll be your oblige.
[220:10.74]I'll answer all questions in regards of your conditions.
[220:20.16]I can't turn off the stream.
[220:22.86]That would be fucking crazy.
[220:25.55]I'm just sitting there like I crushed my pelvis with a TV.
[220:30.57]Help!
[220:31.87]Help!
[220:35.79]That would be so fucked up.
[220:38.52]Alright, we're gonna go kill somebody.
[220:40.14]Talk to Harriet.
[220:46.78]Harry.
[220:47.38]No, that's Mom.
[220:52.14]I'm laughing at that.
[220:56.14]Because that's outrageous.
[220:59.69]That TV is definitely more than 93 pounds, by the way.
[221:05.21]The weight couldn't spread out on it.
[221:07.09]It was teetering around.
[221:08.07]No, I refuse to believe that.
[221:10.82]That thing is fucking unbelievable.
[221:13.36]We're going to look it up.
[221:17.92]What?
[221:18.78]What?
[221:19.58]What is this?
[221:20.82]Who are you?
[221:22.18]Get out of my room.
[221:23.28]There's no need for alarm, madam.
[221:24.98]I'm Dr. Reed, the new surgeon.
[221:26.74]Sitting there for like two hours trying to figure out how to get out of the room.
[221:31.04]I don't want some bumbling intern.
[221:32.77]Turns into a Saw movie.
[221:35.39]I gotta do it.
[221:36.23]I gotta cut my whole pelvis off.
[221:38.65]It's the only way I can crawl to the door.
[221:41.69]If you continue shouting, I'll have you restrained and gagged.
[221:45.01]Understood?
[221:45.48]Jesus.
[221:47.58]How brave.
[221:48.76]Threatening an old defenseless woman.
[221:51.06]You know how long I've been a patient here.
[221:53.36]You've picked the wrong fight.
[221:56.10]I'm Harriet Jones.
[221:57.54]Harriet Jones?
[221:59.40]Indeed.
[222:00.56]I've been meaning to have a chat with you.
[222:02.86]You know what goes on here better than any other patient, I gather.
[222:07.57]Better than any patient, nurse, or doctor.
[222:10.46]I've seen so many vile undertakings.
[222:12.96]I heard there have been some despicable goings-on.
[222:16.12]I just blanked.
[222:16.86]Was it a case of blackmail?
[222:21.64]Blackmail?
[222:23.94]I... Wait.
[222:24.42]If the webcam was just on... Thank God.
[222:27.23]This is why I don't use webcam.
[222:29.77]I just blanked.
[222:31.07]Like, deer in headlights.
[222:32.47]I didn't even know where I was.
[222:33.51]I was just, like, staring into space.
[222:37.51]God.
[222:37.91]I assure you, madam, this is not an investigation into a possible medical error.
[222:44.15]Debauchery, then?
[222:45.71]Nurses Crane, Hawkins, Branigans, whores, all of them.
[222:49.59]They can't keep their legs shut.
[222:51.83]I've seen them scratching slutty sores.
[222:55.78]Well, if you have irrefutable proof, I'll not have the staff behaving in such a manner here.
[223:02.66]This is your business, doctor, not mine.
[223:06.02]I swear one of the nurses is cavorting with some man on hospital hours.
[223:10.88]Thank you for your time, Miss Jones.
[223:13.26]You've given me something to go on.
[223:15.96]See you on the next round.
[223:17.22]God damn it.
[223:20.23]Well, I don't want to find the nurse.
[223:21.71]I have to.
[223:22.21]I have work.
[223:23.57]Alright.
[223:24.03]Patience and staff might know something.
[223:26.57]I'll start my investigation with that.
[223:31.33]I gotta go downstairs.
[223:34.98]I gotta find the nurse.
[223:36.30]She's down a level.
[223:37.42]It's alright, everybody.
[223:38.94]The TV's getting up.
[223:41.22]I have to move it back.
[223:49.96]27 miles this way.
[223:51.56]Where?
[223:52.68]Here?
[223:53.12]We get a rare Jupiter?
[224:07.37]Fine.
[224:07.95]Where the fuck are you, nurse?
[224:09.17]Alright, if I didn't blank out on... That's not because of the game.
[224:19.12]That's because of me.
[224:20.46]That's a me problem.
[224:27.60]Climb in the window?
[224:28.22]How high can I go?
[224:34.21]What's the point of doing this?
[224:39.47]Oh, my spine!
[224:45.29]Still in denial.
[224:46.53]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[224:48.25]We're gonna... She's just walking around here.
[225:09.14]Alright.
[225:10.44]So... Played for about four hours.
[225:21.68]Not playing Minecraft.
[225:22.97]No.
[225:23.27]We're just... Here's what's going on the rest of this week.
[225:29.97]Great job!
[225:30.93]You made him end the stream.
[225:43.21]No.
[225:44.96]Not true.
[225:46.58]But hey, let me tell you some stuff.
[225:48.26]Okay, here's what's going on.
[225:51.04]So, I'm probably going to start Dark Souls Remastered next week.
[225:56.68]Destroy All Humans is going to be Friday night.
[226:02.43]We'll probably play through most of Destroy All Humans.
[226:05.51]I've never played it before.
[226:06.99]I should have.
[226:07.99]Absolutely.
[226:08.47]Don't know why I didn't.
[226:11.71]uh Nintendo labo the like 35 minute joke that I want to make is going to happen at some point in the next week as well uh so destroy all humans Nintendo labo Dark Souls remastered is what you can expect this weekend into next week so I would assume Dark Souls remastered will happen last of those things
[226:40.22]So that's going to be it.
[226:44.56]A little bit, four hours.
[226:45.62]It'll end up being about five hours tonight.
[226:47.52]A little shorter than usual, but I did blank.
[226:51.36]I fucking blanked out in the middle of that last conversation.
[226:54.67]And it's not, you guys got in my head.
[226:57.83]You got inside my head.
[227:00.09]So that's going to be it for tonight.
[227:05.99]You guys infiltrated my brain and turned it off.
[227:13.57]but we still got a lot of bits to read and obviously these subs for tonight yeah brain infiltration but with that hey here come all the subs all the new subs tonight resubs and new subs thank you everybody here they come where are they oh there they are okay

[230:24.24]But, thank you.
[230:27.58]So let's move on to the bits now.
[230:31.45]Quite a few.
[230:31.83]Let's throw on the proper outro here and let's go back down to earlier today.
[230:41.60]Thank you Sir Feline for the $1.00.
[230:43.97]Jeremy, do you dab while setting up your booster seat in your favorite fursuit before every stream?
[230:47.61]Also, Rat Movie 3 Hype Train starts here.
[230:49.42]Chat.
[230:49.72]jermaRat.
[230:50.28]I don't need the answer to these questions anymore.
[230:53.32]They were already proven right or wrong.
[230:57.18]But thank you, Sir Feline.
[230:58.14]Thank you.
[230:58.48]Bake me home for the two bucks.
[230:59.72]Oh, by the way, if you're leaving, have a great night.
[231:03.62]Have a great rest of the week, too.
[231:05.74]You know that thing that you're working on?
[231:06.86]You know the thing that's really stressing you out tonight and tomorrow?
[231:11.54]Because, man, I'll see you Friday.
[231:12.93]And we, you know, obviously we'll hang out on Friday.
[231:15.15]The thing that's really, you know, giving you problems, just fucking knock it out of the park, man.
[231:19.07]You know what I'm saying?
[231:19.63]Just get destroyed.
[231:21.39]Knock it out of the fucking park.
[231:24.31]Believe in yourself.
[231:25.07]Good night.
[231:25.45]Bye.
[231:26.33]See you later.
[231:27.17]Whoever just left.
[231:31.30]Thank you.
[231:31.62]Bake me home for the two bucks.
[231:33.38]Sorry, Jerma can't stay for the stream.
[231:34.54]Currently finishing the Bloodborne DLC.
[231:36.02]It's my first time playing the whole game.
[231:38.82]The Bloodborne DLC is very good.
[231:43.28]Phenomenal, one would say.
[231:44.72]Except there's one portion of the DLC that's a little lazy, I guess is the word.
[231:51.06]But 90% of the Bloodborne DLC is absolutely phenomenal.
[231:58.95]But thank you, Bake Me Home.
[232:00.03]If you catch this, hope you enjoyed it.
[232:04.79]Wonderful Telephone.
[232:06.17]Thanks for the $1.
[232:07.15]It is Wednesday.
[232:07.87]Do not forget to squeeze mustard on the cat.
[232:12.75]I don't know what that's a reference to, but I'll make sure to not forget that.
[232:16.27]I'm not going to do it, but I won't forget it.
[232:20.57]And then again, Valentoro gave $50 here four hours ago.
[232:27.12]Thank you for that.
[232:28.60]Just touch upon it one more time.
[232:30.34]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[232:31.54]Jeremy, you debated me so hard.
[232:32.78]I was expecting my favorite Compaq streamer to actually get through Blighttown today.
[232:38.24]I got through Blighttown.
[232:39.04]I stopped after I got through Blighttown because I had to turn around and go the other way and go through it again.
[232:44.99]Don't worry, we'll get through it together.
[232:48.03]But thank you for the one dollar.
[232:49.09]Thank you, Mars Gaming YouTube, for the one buck.
[232:52.71]Craigasm, JermaCraft, one word, one man.
[232:55.05]Do people still play that game?
[233:05.68]No, okay, so tell me what happened here.
[233:08.71]So I got through Blighttown, and I killed the spider scorpion lady.
[233:15.51]And then I had to go... I turned around, and I couldn't figure out how to go.
[233:19.35]There was a sewer I could have gone through, but it looked like it was a dead end.
[233:23.50]Or go all the way back through Blighttown, and I didn't want to do that.
[233:28.00]So you guys will help me, right?
[233:31.21]I mean, it's gonna be sub-only mode.
[233:33.27]And it's gonna cost like $25 to write in the chat one sentence.
[233:37.95]So I'm looking forward to your assistance in that matter.
[233:40.87]I'm looking forward to you guys chatting and helping me.
[233:43.91]But you gotta pay, you know what I mean?
[233:45.04]You gotta pay for it.
[233:52.54]What do you think would happen if a streamer did that?
[233:56.20]If it was possible?
[233:58.38]To make it so it was $1 to write in the chat every time.
[234:04.36]You need a bunch of extensions, but can you imagine the backlash that person would get?
[234:18.27]Just walk around in circles until people pay to tell you where to go.
[234:24.55]Emote only, make minimum bits $1.
[234:30.41]It's been considered.

[234:46.82]Oh, by the way, nice ass-eating scene that we got to see.
[234:49.68]Well, we didn't get halfway through the game, so I can't even tell.

[235:23.51]The grip is just too tight.
[235:24.67]I keep telling them to loosen it, but they refuse to help me out.
[235:27.57]I think it's a conspiracy.
[235:28.49]Did you know Robohand Industries are owned by the same company who specialize in pee-pee reconstruction?
[235:33.85]They're trying to swindle me, I know it.

[236:06.18]PP Reconstruction.
[236:07.56]You guys...
[236:16.54]I think I think I know what happened tonight so like the TV bit brought us up to an 11 and Then I played this fucking boring game and it brought us down to like a four So I think I think I understand what happened here We started off at an 11 and we came down to like a three and a half It was the XD in the title
[236:45.78]admits it was Bor.
[236:46.66]I'm not, I don't think that.
[236:49.41]I'm just saying.
[236:51.27]At the opening credits, the huge fight scene happens.
[236:55.19]And, you know, Jackie Chan has taken on like 30 people.
[236:58.55]It's the new Jackie Chan movie.
[236:59.99]Credits open.
[237:01.07]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[237:02.92]Through the... Guy brings a ladder up.

[237:09.10]Four guys around go flying through windows.
[237:11.32]Explosions everywhere.
[237:12.86]And then the rest of the movie is Jackie Chan at a desk...
[237:17.29]Writing letters for an hour.
[237:20.87]That's the rest of the movie.
[237:22.27]That's what happened today.
[237:22.99]That's what this movie was.
[237:26.03]That's what happened.
[237:32.50]He was writing his Christmas cards for the rest of the movie.
[237:41.61]For three hours.
[237:49.97]So, there you go.
[237:50.85]I figured out what happened.
[237:53.13]The movie was too interesting in the first, like, 12 minutes.
[237:55.98]And then I was writing Christmas cards for four hours.
[238:02.42]But, anyways.
[238:05.28]Thank you, Mars Gaming YT for the $1.

[238:54.68]Uh, Coat My... That's a 25 center.
[238:59.66]Thank you, Sly161 for the two bucks.
[239:02.76]So how wasted did you get during the polygraph stream and how bad was the hangover?
[239:07.72]I'm fine.
[239:08.12]I wasn't that... It didn't really affect me that much.
[239:13.89]That was like a... Not even... What was it?
[239:15.33]Like a half pint of Jim Bean?
[239:16.85]Not even... There were probably like four shots in that bottle.
[239:20.33]That's not that much.
[239:23.24]It was just enough to loosen me up.
[239:25.46]It was fake?
[239:25.84]No, it was real.
[239:26.78]That was real alcohol.
[239:27.70]It was.
[239:30.76]No, there's... 12 ounces in a pint.
[239:40.33]So, and there was... Doc Schmoygan took, like, at least one or two shots out of there.
[239:47.29]Shot is, like, two ounces, so there was probably, like, four to five shots in there.
[239:54.07]Twelve pints in an ounce.
[239:56.88]It was just enough to loosen me up.
[239:57.92]That was the goal.
[240:00.88]And it worked.
[240:06.02]how many pints in an ounce how many it's 12 it's 12 ounces for a pint and it was whiskey it was Jim bean whiskey but I love whiskey though so I can drink I love drinking whiskey it's funny because I I can't drink drinking like two or three beers it disgusts me
[240:30.59]It fills me up.
[240:31.63]It makes me, like, really belchy and really heavy and bloated.
[240:34.19]I hate the... And it's... I don't like the way that... Beer's gross to me.
[240:38.49]But I will drink whiskey all night and be perfectly happy and just completely fine.
[240:44.39]Don't even... Don't mix it.
[240:46.11]Just drink it.
[240:50.52]Or cider.
[240:51.74]Whiskey or cider are my two favorites.
[240:55.24]Cider I can drink a few of them, but cider does the same thing though.
[240:57.83]After you have like three ciders, it's like... You don't get like that when you drink whiskey.
[241:06.85]But you have to be careful when you drink hard alcohol and don't get, don't like... Don't be an idiot, right?
[241:13.52]Know your limits.
[241:15.72]Hard alcohol can really fuck you up.
[241:18.61]Bad.
[241:21.57]My recommendation, if you're over 21 or you're wherever you are in whatever country, is just get Two Fingers of whiskey.
[241:27.67]That's it.
[241:29.04]Sip on that all night.
[241:30.10]Sip on that for like fucking three hours.
[241:32.26]That's all you need.
[241:33.44]Just hang out and talk.
[241:34.90]Clink some glasses.
[241:36.68]You don't need to like slam alcohol.
[241:38.66]Don't be an idiot.
[241:43.92]Three Fingers.
[241:44.44]Well, if you have tolerance and you can do two and a half, Two Fingers.
[241:47.99]That's all you need.
[241:53.25]sip it a hand two swole fingers after college you realize shots are the worst thing yeah especially he's like don't like here's the thing about drinking alcohol
[242:18.18]I don't know what it is with everybody, but everybody wants to drink like the grossest shit.
[242:22.52]Every party I've ever been to, every big gathering where it's like, oh, it's a big party.
[242:27.38]Why do you guys drink Fireball?
[242:29.92]Who wants that?
[242:30.80]Why does somebody always order it?
[242:33.02]Hey, yo, we want to do some shots, right?
[242:34.74]Want to do some, to drink some shots?
[242:36.46]Alright, um, Fireball.
[242:39.52]No, you idiot.
[242:40.58]What, you stupid idiot.
[242:41.84]What are you doing?
[242:43.40]Don't order Fireball.
[242:44.64]Never order it.
[242:45.16]Don't ever order it again.
[242:47.03]Don't be an idiot and order Fireball.
[242:53.55]It's cheap?
[242:54.15]No, don't be an idiot.
[242:58.45]It covers up the taste.
[243:00.55]But why does it, what?
[243:07.45]Don't drink Goldschlager.
[243:10.03]No, do not drink Goldschlager either.
[243:14.04]Get a nice single barrel, or get a nice blended whiskey, and just sip on it.
[243:21.88]Fireball gives me fucking flashbacks.
[243:23.92]Yeah, it's just... It's just the drink that everybody orders at a party.
[243:28.32]And I think I have a theory here.
[243:30.64]It's because they don't know what anything else is.
[243:33.68]It's like that guy has only ordered Fireball.
[243:37.03]He's never ordered another drink in his life.
[243:40.07]One time he ordered Fireball and he was like, fuck man, this sucks, but that's the only thing I know how to say at a bar.
[243:45.31]Hey, can I get four shots of Fireball?
[243:51.61]I think that's the only one I know.
[243:53.01]That one.
[244:02.66]I'm just... Fireball sucks, but... Yes, it's cheap.
[244:08.91]But at the end of the day, what are you doing?
[244:10.45]Like, what are you trying to do?
[244:12.65]Well, I mean, the purpose of cheap... Cheap fucking shots.
[244:16.71]I'm just trying to drink as fast as possible and get as drunk as I possibly can as fast as I fucking can.
[244:24.08]Don't be an idiot.
[244:33.41]Alright, now that that little bit is over, let's keep going.
[244:42.85]What about vodka?
[244:43.55]Vodka's not bad.
[244:45.33]Good vodka is good.
[244:48.81]There are a lot of different... Here's the thing about alcohol, there's so many different versions.
[244:52.61]There's so many different tiers.
[244:56.04]Like, yeah, you could get a, like, field-tested, beat-up shotgun vodka.
[245:01.82]Or you could get a factory-new, beautiful vodka.
[245:09.22]They're the same thing.
[245:10.78]But would you really want to equip the field-tested or the well-worn?
[245:14.01]No.
[245:14.23]It's hard to get good vodka.
[245:21.13]Yeah.
[245:22.41]Vodka's really easy to mix with things, though.
[245:24.41]If you really can't do hard alcohol...
[245:27.24]The first thing I would say is just don't.
[245:29.74]Because there really is like no reason to if you don't like it.
[245:35.34]Don't let the guy with the backwards hat and the fucking beard come over with like, Fireball, drink it, dickhead.
[245:40.30]No, grab his hat and like spin it around.
[245:44.32]And then tell him to get out of here.
[245:54.93]College.
[245:58.51]stat stat track vodka no I know plenty of my friends like drink fireball I'm obviously just like taking the piss but you know for real drink weed I mean you can well technically
[246:23.74]But anyways, that's my opinion on alcohol.
[246:26.56]Just do Two Fingers, that's all you need.
[246:28.46]Over a period of like a couple hours, just hang out.
[246:31.64]You can get there, but you don't want to be the guy that ends up having two people weekend at Bernie's you, through the party, into the bathroom, and then just let you go, right?
[246:45.04]You don't want to get there.
[246:48.89]We've all been there at one point.
[246:50.21]You know, like, people have to lift your hand up to wave, like, Weekend at fucking Bernie's.
[246:53.85]Like, hey, I was by.
[246:54.89]Nice to see you.
[246:57.91]And you, like, got the glasses on.
[246:59.13]Your head's just down.
[246:59.92]Wait, you guys never seen Weekend at Bernie's?
[247:12.60]It's the most insane concept for a movie ever.
[247:15.46]And they made two of them.
[247:19.57]Weekend at Bernie's is a movie about a guy that dies in the very beginning of the movie, and two frat boys have to make it look like he's alive the entire movie.
[247:28.72]They have to... People think he's alive the whole movie, and he's not.
[247:34.07]He dies in the first, like, ten minutes of the movie.
[247:39.93]Should I watch this tonight?
[247:40.79]Yes, you should.
[247:41.31]Absolutely.
[247:44.25]It's the dumbest fucking thing ever.
[247:48.26]I was thinking that, like, oh, why have they not remade Weekend at Bernie's?
[247:52.06]And I thought about it.
[247:54.38]That probably wouldn't fly in 2018.
[247:58.63]You know, oh, yeah, there's a guy that's dead in the movie, and we make a funny joke that he's a dead guy, and we, like, drag him around and pretend to wave his hands at people.
[248:07.83]I'm not sure, like, that would fly.
[248:09.69]Maybe not, but it sure did back in the 80s and the early 90s.
[248:18.74]It would fly.
[248:19.26]It would just suck.
[248:21.88]The movie's... I mean, it's a terrible movie, but it's funny.
[248:32.25]But anyways, let's keep going.
[248:37.75]Uh, thank you to... Spreo for the $1.
[248:40.95]Hey, Jerma.
[248:42.29]Birthday boy here.
[248:43.40]Too bad I don't have... Too bad I have a lot of tests today.
[248:46.40]Feels bad, man.
[248:48.54]I would appreciate if you made any joke to offset that.
[248:51.58]Thanks.
[248:53.78]Well, Spreo.
[248:55.16]First of all, happy birthday.
[248:57.37]Hope you have a good one.
[248:59.05]Wait, birthday today?
[248:59.97]Where are you located?
[249:01.39]It's currently 1115 Eastern.
[249:06.43]So, are you European?
[249:08.29]EU?
[249:08.55]Hold on.
[249:10.83]Streamer gets flattened on stream.
[249:12.33]I need to see this.
[249:21.43]I really couldn't pick this up.
[249:22.98]You know how awkward this thing is?
[249:40.19]I hit my head on the back of the wall.
[249:50.91]You don't understand how heavy that thing actually is.
[249:55.53]Unless you change careers, you won't really need to pick up TVs.
[250:05.36]Anyways, thank you to... Where are we?
[250:17.84]Super sale, thanks for the $1.
[250:18.76]Jerma, I'm sorry to say, the whole measure how much the TV weighs was incredibly out of sync.
[250:24.94]I think that makes it funnier, though.
[250:31.99]It's like half a second out of sync.
[250:36.91]What, like a fucking god?
[250:39.85]Idiot.
[250:41.09]Thank you, Sly161, for the $2.
[250:42.41]Terrific attorney, alive on stream.
[250:48.42]No, surprisingly, I'm completely fine.
[250:55.98]Have you ever been on a bus and scared that you missed your stop?
[250:59.60]No, I pay complete attention when I'm riding on public transit.
[251:04.27]Because I have this weird, terrified fear that I'm never going to make it.
[251:08.13]You know, like if I'm on the subway and I miss my stop, you're on that train.
[251:11.93]You've got to get off.
[251:12.61]You've got to panic.
[251:13.71]How do I get back?
[251:14.27]Where's the outbound train?
[251:15.23]I've got to get back to there.
[251:16.50]No, I pay complete attention when I use public transit.
[251:20.65]Thank you, GK9999 for the $1 to help pay for your TV-induced hospital bills.
[251:26.33]Thank you.
[251:27.95]I will use it.

[252:24.10]Okay.
[252:34.00]God damn it.
[252:41.08]Wait, why did I get banned?
[252:42.54]That's the porn one.

[253:06.46]Hey, Jerma.
[253:07.60]Just want to say you've been knocking it out of the park lately.
[253:10.91]The Polygraph stream was a genuine 10 out of 10.
[253:12.73]Wish I could donate more, but for now have a vending machine soda on me.
[253:16.71]P.S.
[253:17.87]Dr. Polygraph for the Jerma Rumpel.
[253:22.77]I got a feeling you may be seeing a little bit more of Dr. Schmoygan.
[253:29.23]I got a feeling that
[253:31.95]I got a feeling you might see him in the future somewhere.
[253:36.13]Just a hunch on my part.
[253:40.84]Just a hunch for me.
[253:42.46]I am now mostly moistened thanks to the dollar fifty.
[253:45.38]But anyways, AncientSasquatch, I really appreciate that.
[253:48.09]Thank you for the incredibly kind words.
[253:50.43]I'm glad you're enjoying the streams.
[253:53.55]And I want to do more shit like that.
[253:57.22]So that is not the end of the road there.
[253:59.64]That's just the beginning of the stream.
[254:01.44]So we shall keep going.
[254:04.91]Thanks for the $1.50 though.
[254:05.83]Mostly moistened.
[254:06.51]Hey Jerma, although I've gone through some tough points in my life recently, just wanted to say that I've been watching your videos and streams for the last few months now.
[254:13.75]And in all that time, I've yet to find any enjoyment or entertainment from them.
[254:17.75]But thanks for trying, I guess.
[254:21.53]You know, thank you.
[254:26.71]Honest?
[254:27.33]Honest answer.
[254:29.33]Thank you.
[254:31.79]That's all I could do is try.
[254:38.96]That was good.
[254:40.12]Atrolux Atrox, thanks for the $1.
[254:42.24]Every game you've played these last weeks have had rats in them.
[254:44.76]Is that a coincidence?
[254:45.64]I think not.
[254:46.32]jermaRat.
[254:48.42]Thank you.
[254:50.00]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[254:51.36]Hi, handsome boy.
[254:52.18]Can you make the VODs last longer on your channel?
[254:54.39]Also, when are you making Fat Movie 3?
[254:58.06]spencer spencer is he still here uh spencer uh 60 days three or two months I mean that's the default is there we're gonna get a situation where we can make certain vods be forever or more than two months
[255:18.56]You know, maybe not all of them, but maybe there's a few of them that I particularly would want to be able to be watched forever.
[255:23.55]Maybe.
[255:24.03]Or is that too much bandwidth?
[255:25.23]Does that take too much bandwidth on the Twitch side?
[255:27.47]Maybe.
[255:30.43]Maybe.
[255:36.04]I think the company line is try YouTube.
[255:39.48]Alright.
[255:42.18]Alright.
[255:43.02]Okay.
[255:43.20]We got it.
[255:50.36]That's your answer, guys.
[255:53.98]But I have no control over how long they last.
[255:57.50]I mean, I could like... I can like highlight a stream and it lasts forever.
[256:04.87]But I don't think... Can you highlight like four hours and save it forever?
[256:09.95]I'm not even sure you can do that.
[256:11.29]Maybe you can, but I feel like that might be a super pain in the ass.
[256:18.46]What's a YouTube...
[256:23.84]Well, a YouTube is an interesting euphemism for self-destruction.
[256:33.35]It actually, YouTube in the dictionary is defined as over the course of four to five years, someone or something wholeheartedly, completely implodes.
[256:47.48]That's what it is defined as.
[256:49.12]That's a YouTube.
[256:49.64]YouTube.
[256:56.18]but we had petabytes of video that had never been watched even once since the Justin TV days oh my god but thank you son of jenova for the one dollar thank you reaper 500 for the one dollar hey Jeremy the polygraph stream made me remember a funny story I have about the firewatch video
[257:21.12]When I was watching it in college, my roommate came in when you said, that's an asshole, that's my asshole.
[257:25.85]He gave me a weird look and I had to show him another one of your videos to prove I wasn't watching porn.
[257:33.85]Sorry for that unfortunate circumstance, but maybe he understands now.
[257:38.53]Thank you.
[257:40.78]Thank you, Sir Feline.
[257:41.64]Again, for the $1, this dialogue is absolutely fantastic.
[257:45.34]But, but...
[257:47.77]They wrote one of those.
[257:49.47]So that means, uh, cartastic, right?
[257:55.77]That means it's a pretty cartastic, uh, response.
[257:59.63]Hey, look who it is!
[258:00.39]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the one dollar.
[258:02.25]Hi, diddly-do there, Jermario.
[258:05.69]Garfield the Paragraph Writer here, reporting live from Universal Studios.
[258:09.76]Odie and I came to celebrate after I graduated from the Toonversity after years of study.
[258:13.74]Thanks for all your germosity!
[258:15.90]It's like generosity with a Jerm up.
[258:17.88]You ever been to Universal before?
[258:19.04]Jay Diggity?
[258:20.43]They got a neat Harry Potter rollercoaster featuring one of Timmy Turner's dragon horcruxes.
[258:24.97]Incoming Harry Potter reference.
[258:26.85]I solemnly swear that I'm up to Garfgood, LOL, X3.
[258:34.29]Yeah!
[258:38.68]Yes, I have been to Universal.
[258:40.90]Here's the funny thing about Universal.
[258:42.14]Universal was the worst place ever 15 years ago.
[258:47.21]The lines were so long, it was like three hours to go on King Kong, and here's the awful thing about that shit, dumb, stupid King Kong ride.
[258:56.47]Your suspension of disbelief is destroyed because there's a portion, a couple of portions actually, where you sit there for three hours, you get on the ride, and wow, this is great, can't wait to go see King Kong.
[259:06.62]The stupid trolley that hangs floats by.
[259:09.22]Whoa, King Kong's on a building, that's insane!
[259:12.20]Oh, he's right next to us!
[259:13.80]We're going by him, he's on our left!
[259:17.71]Whoa, that was crazy.
[259:19.33]I'm looking behind him.
[259:20.33]I'm looking behind me, and he's there still on that building.
[259:24.03]And then you turn around, you face forward, and King Kong's there again, like 30 feet in front of you.
[259:29.44]You can turn and see King Kong, and King Kong's in front of you.
[259:33.28]You didn't give enough time.
[259:34.46]Why didn't you turn a corner?
[259:35.83]I can see them.
[259:37.61]The suspension of disbelief is destroyed.
[259:39.29]It's bullshit.
[259:44.11]Oh no, King Kong's grabbing somebody out of a building.
[259:47.28]They're right next to each other.
[259:49.44]You've ruined it.
[259:51.25]Don't be an idiot.
[259:52.93]Put down the fireball, King Kong.
[259:58.43]But that park was a piece of shit.
[260:03.68]I remember going there and hating it when I was probably like 12 or 13.
[260:07.38]Nowadays, though, with the introduction of things like Fast Pass, where you don't have to sit in line for three hours to go see that.
[260:15.85]you know, 45-second experience that's not even that good.
[260:19.51]It's still fun to bring your kids and, you know, bring your grandma and go see King Kong.
[260:24.04]And Harry Potter's there now, and that's interesting enough.
[260:26.32]The Escape from Gringotts is a really, really cool ride.
[260:29.14]I liked that one a lot.
[260:33.52]So Universal is now cool because of the introduction of Fastpass.
[260:38.23]All parks turned out pretty interesting now because of those.
[260:41.21]It was unbearable.
[260:46.60]Oh, but thank you, Garfield.
[260:47.56]Thank you.
[260:47.88]Mostly lost for the $1.
[260:48.94]You need to stop sneezing.
[260:49.88]It seems to only lead to bad things recently.
[260:55.44]Who's ever said that sneezes led to something good?
[260:59.08]No one has that conversation.
[261:00.60]Remember the time I sneezed and how awesome it was after?
[261:04.14]No.
[261:04.96]Sneezes only lead to awful things because you lose control of your body for three seconds.
[261:09.68]You ever been driving a car and sneeze?
[261:12.48]It's the most terrifying three seconds of your life.
[261:15.85]You rear back and you're like, oh shit, I'm going to drive into somebody.
[261:20.16]And you like, and you hope to God that like you don't, no.
[261:24.98]Sneezing is terrifying.
[261:26.94]Especially in situations where you lose control of your senses.
[261:34.33]Nothing good's ever come from a sneeze.
[261:37.35]Only bad things, so.
[261:41.84]You totally panic when you drive sneezing?
[261:43.52]Yeah, because your eyes have to close.
[261:47.56]Your head rears up and down and your eyes close for a second.
[261:53.46]That's not good to do by operating anything.
[261:57.88]Forget about cars.
[261:59.36]What if you were a guy that was operating a table saw and you were sneezing, right?
[262:03.95]You're like, Oh, fuck, I'm dead.
[262:10.47]That's what would go through my mind.
[262:12.87]Oh, my hand is gone.
[262:13.97]You know what I'm saying?
[262:18.39]It's terrifying.
[262:23.21]Waluigi.
[262:25.57]What if you're a surgeon?
[262:26.55]Yeah, exactly.
[262:27.65]You're operating on somebody.
[262:29.39]You're like carving off their aorta.
[262:31.95]You're pulling their heart out.
[262:33.27]You got one little thing and all of a sudden it's like, oh shit, I'm gonna kill this guy.
[262:38.19]This guy's dead.
[262:46.21]That guy's dead.
[262:48.97]That's why if I ever have surgery, I'm going to make it very, very clear to the doctors and the nurses in the room.
[262:55.05]I want a doctor.
[262:55.85]I don't care what insurance I have to go through.
[262:58.27]I want a doctor without any allergies.
[263:01.55]Make that a staple of my surgeon, please.
[263:07.60]Doctor allergic to pollen?
[263:09.38]I ain't getting surgery in the summer.
[263:11.70]I'm going in there in the dead of winter.
[263:23.02]You should have done nothing today.
[263:24.52]Game was a mistake.
[263:29.76]They wear masks?
[263:31.06]That doesn't matter.
[263:31.74]Guys, if I look at the light incorrectly, it makes me sneeze.
[263:37.85]You know how many people have that sensory?
[263:40.07]There's something that's called something where if you look at a bright light, if your light shines in your face, sun, it's not just pollen that causes somebody to sneeze.
[263:54.74]But thank you, Peter, for the $1, and they say XD.
[263:59.42]It was $1.
[264:00.40]I'm going to say it was $1, even though I fucked up.
[264:03.36]Lobotomized Teddy Bear, thanks for the $1.
[264:05.18]Jerma, I'm a huge fan of you and your content.
[264:07.14]As a historian, I would recommend you read more about the Spanish flu.
[264:11.85]It's one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, killing about 4% of the world population.
[264:19.01]Thank you, Lobotomized Teddy Bear, but why would I do that?
[264:26.62]Why would I want to read about 4% of the world dying?
[264:34.32]On a serious note, did the combat feel like Bloodborne?
[264:38.33]Um... Not really.
[264:43.81]It... Yeah, it has a dodge and you... All the enemies sort of attacked the same way.
[264:49.91]It was kind of big guy with a gun or little guy with a knife.
[264:52.71]Or ghoul with two hands that lunges at you.
[264:54.71]I feel... No.
[264:59.23]I mean, everything has to be compared to Dark Souls.
[265:02.83]So... And I agree, I do this all the time as well.
[265:09.70]Oh, it's about vampires.
[265:11.12]Oh, okay.
[265:11.58]Well, that makes sense.
[265:15.20]But, I mean, it's sort of in the same realm as those games, I would say.
[265:19.88]But if you're looking for fast-paced combat all the time, it's not this game.
[265:24.69]Combat makes up, it seems, about maybe 30% of the whole game.
[265:29.68]Everything else is kind of look around and talk to people and eat them.
[265:35.16]But, uh, thank you Sir Feline for the one dollar.
[265:37.14]Vampire girl is literally so edgy that I think I got a decent amount of cuts by her presence.
[265:45.30]Why?
[265:45.62]What are you talking about?
[265:50.70]She like came out of the screen and bit you?
[265:53.24]She like ring-girled you?
[265:54.48]Is that what you're saying?
[265:59.75]Well, you gotta stop watching The Ring.
[266:04.65]Googly Gareth, thanks for the two dollars.
[266:07.31]Hey, dude.
[266:07.81]Thanks for the years of entertainment.
[266:08.92]Been watching since the TF2 days.
[266:11.00]Hope I can give a little bit back with these bits.
[266:14.62]And the SFM animation I've made for you.
[266:16.94]Thanks so much for the opportunity, man.
[266:18.44]Keep it up.
[266:20.26]Oh, fuck.
[266:22.60]My brain is scrambled eggs.
[266:25.78]But yes, thank you, Googly Gareth.
[266:31.87]Feels good, man.
[266:36.02]Sometimes I go on autopilot.
[266:39.52]And just fall asleep.
[266:41.28]And the plane's still driving.
[266:42.62]We're still going to our destination.
[266:44.78]But, you know, maybe the stewardess is pinging the captain's chair.
[266:51.18]Like, hey, we just drove over Milwaukee and, I mean, everything's fine.
[266:56.29]You're doing a great job driving this plane.
[266:58.09]You're a top 1,000th captain.
[267:01.37]But, I mean, you did pass over the destination.
[267:03.85]If you could turn around... I'm still sleeping.
[267:06.54]And eventually I wake up on my own.
[267:07.90]And I look around and it's like...
[267:12.05]What happened?
[267:12.89]And we're, like, 600 miles over the Arctic?
[267:16.91]Oh, shit.
[267:17.53]Okay, well, I can correct this.
[267:18.91]And I turn around and do, like, a sick move.
[267:20.51]And I, like, do plain barrels three times.
[267:24.02]And, like, make sure I put the seatbelt sign on first before I do that.
[267:28.04]And then we go.
[267:28.68]And it's an awesome move.
[267:29.90]And, wow, we're going back.
[267:31.76]We're going back to New York.
[267:33.20]You know what I'm saying?
[267:33.71]We're going back to, like, Boston.
[267:35.85]We're going back to, like, the correct place that I drove over.
[267:40.25]We're going back to, like, Detroit.
[267:42.59]Sorry, I missed Detroit.
[267:43.71]Like, yeah, we'll go back.
[267:44.83]It is a cool move that I do.
[267:50.79]I drove, like, across the whole country.
[267:55.47]And I sneeze.
[268:04.99]But yeah, my brain is...
[268:08.66]As I get older, I don't know how much worse it's going to get.
[268:10.64]I'm going to be like 45.
[268:17.38]And be the guy that doesn't have one shoe on.
[268:21.02]Walking around somewhere in like a public place.
[268:23.16]He's like just yelling about stuff.
[268:26.26]Honey, don't look at him.
[268:30.50]Don't look.
[268:30.98]Don't make eye contact with the scary guy.
[268:32.67]What?
[268:39.98]And I'll find, like, a fruit roll up on the ground and eat it.
[268:42.06]Uh, thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[268:47.24]They say XD with $2, so thank you.
[268:53.81]Hey, Garfield, the Monday Killer gave $2 with two back-to-back Garfagraphs.
[269:05.53]Big spender Garfield spends $2 on one stream.
[269:08.37]What a crazy cat.
[269:10.33]I Had to after you brought up dreams last night.
[269:12.71]I had a dream I was on an expedition to Muppet Temple in Kermit swamp.
[269:18.18]I Don't know why I was even there at the entrance of spear and axe bearing Jason Seagal attacked me as I jumped across the electric mayhem Tiki's Mr.. Seagal kept trying to murder me as I ran through the Muppet Temple in an attempt to escape his seagull miss prior pretty garfed up
[269:36.08]Yes, x3.
[269:36.86]Pretty fucked up.
[269:39.22]Pretty messed up, Garfield.
[269:44.05]Thank you for the $2, Garfield.
[269:52.74]Hey, Asian Turtle.
[269:54.10]Thanks for the $1.
[269:56.06]Good luck with the centipedes and scorpions crawling on you when you're sleeping once you move to the desert.
[270:00.60]Just make sure you shake out your shoes before putting them on.
[270:03.68]I once found a six inch centipede in my shoe after I took it off.
[270:10.83]Repeat after me.
[270:13.97]Anything is better than mosquitoes.
[270:17.79]Say it again.
[270:19.37]Anything is better than mosquitoes.
[270:23.15]One last time.
[270:25.03]Anything is better than mosquitoes.
[270:30.75]Okay.
[270:33.45]I'm relaxed now.
[270:39.64]There are mosquitoes in Nevada.
[270:40.90]It's too dry.
[270:44.54]You don't, no, you don't got, you don't got, your idea of mosquitoes is not Massachusetts's idea of mosquitoes.
[270:54.99]You could give a, give me a two, two half dollar size spiders on both of my eyes like I'm at a spa.
[271:04.59]And I would take that over walking outside.
[271:07.97]in this rainy-ass environment, and then it gets all humid, and you are swarmed, surrounded by mosquitoes, whose sole intention is to drink your blood.
[271:23.26]Think about that.
[271:24.28]Oh no, it's a big spider!
[271:25.70]A big centipede!
[271:26.84]Whoa, scary!
[271:28.20]We're getting out of here!
[271:29.97]Those things, there's not a hundred centipedes all swarming around your body, desperately trying to drink blood out of you.
[271:39.38]I will take the desert.
[271:42.22]I don't want any more bloodsuckers.
[271:45.35]They're awful around here.
[271:53.43]Mosquitoes are awful in mass, but I'll take them over desert bugs.
[271:56.27]I'm not sure I would.
[272:00.83]Just watch me say this, and I'm going to get stung.
[272:03.01]The first day I live in this new place, I'm going to get stung by a scorpion.
[272:07.80]And I'm gonna be, like, in the ER with, like, an inflamed, like, wisdom teeth face.
[272:14.16]Should've stayed with the mosquitoes.
[272:15.46]At least mosquitoes don't poison you.
[272:18.64]They just drink blood out of your body.
[272:20.22]What was I thinking?
[272:25.43]But, thank you, Asian Turtle.
[272:26.43]Thank you, Bang9c9, for the... Thank you, Sly161, for the $1.
[272:32.35]Next time you play a vampire game, make the stream titled Dabula.
[272:37.77]I don't think I will.
[272:40.09]Hey, Machete Mario, thanks for the two bucks.
[272:42.35]Minecraft now.
[272:46.85]Not gonna happen.
[272:47.87]But thank you for the two dollars, Machete.
[272:51.45]No stars, thanks for the one dollar.
[272:52.99]And Flank Tank, fifty bucks.
[272:56.04]Just wanna reiterate it again.
[272:58.16]Thank you, guys.
[273:00.60]Much love to you.
[273:01.94]YFT gave a hundred dollars earlier, too.
[273:03.72]Thank you so much.
[273:06.04]One hundred bucks.
[273:10.25]It's a lot of money.
[273:10.77]Thank you so much.
[273:12.85]Hope you enjoy the burger that I made for you.
[273:20.38]Thank you, sir.
[273:20.94]Fee line for the $1.
[273:21.98]Mommy, Jerma, can we please have different food?
[273:23.68]I'm going to call Child Protective Services if you keep starving me.
[273:28.52]And they're going to show up and they're going to see that there's a perfectly nice lean cuisine meal in front of you that you decided you weren't going to eat.
[273:38.62]And that we've got juice in the fridge.
[273:40.52]We've got water.
[273:41.63]We've got milk.
[273:42.25]We've got bread.
[273:43.13]You can make toast and butter.
[273:45.39]There's frozen waffles in there too.
[273:47.65]There are chicken patties in there.
[273:49.11]You want to make one of those?
[273:50.17]Go for it.
[273:50.67]You can do that.
[273:51.41]We've got plenty of food in the fridge.
[273:54.65]There's some hummus.
[273:55.77]Pita bread.
[273:56.49]You can eat that.
[273:57.43]You don't have to eat that.
[273:58.15]Just eat what's in the fridge.
[274:02.23]We have food at home.
[274:03.77]Yeah, exactly.
[274:05.85]You weren't letting us make something else.
[274:10.20]Well, look, all I have in my fridge is Lean Cuisines right now, so you have to eat one of those.
[274:18.42]The food was burnt and inedible.
[274:19.90]The juice was burnt as well.
[274:21.18]You can't burn... I want soft serve, mama.
[274:30.59]No, soft serve sucks.
[274:32.83]Get the real hard ice cream.
[274:34.97]Don't even bother.
[274:44.63]Streamer eats fake diet food.
[274:46.23]Wait, what do you mean hold the phone?
[274:50.44]Soft serve is worse than hard ice cream.
[274:58.08]No, mom, not the hummus again.
[274:59.74]I drink black coffee.
[275:04.99]That's what I do.
[275:05.71]If I pull up to a drive-thru...
[275:11.74]Like a Starbucks or a Dunkin' Donuts, I get a black coffee.
[275:15.66]Or I get a CBBB, but I don't drink those anymore.
[275:18.40]Because I'm trying to be healthier, so we just do black coffee now.
[275:21.74]Black cold brew.
[275:23.50]So, BCB.
[275:27.45]Fucking you.
[275:34.39]I love a CBBB, but you can't do that anymore.
[275:37.25]I can't do it anymore.
[275:38.01]I want to get away from it.
[275:44.10]Enjoy chugging your shit bean water.
[275:46.64]What are you talking about?
[275:47.94]I don't know what kind of coffee you guys are drinking.
[275:53.12]Okay.
[275:54.52]I don't know what kind of backyard barbecue Keurig coffee that you're drinking.
[276:00.39]But if you get a good cold brew made with really good beans, you don't need to put anything in it.
[276:07.76]Like, just because you got the floor model of the lowest tier Keurig doesn't mean that coffee that's black is bad.
[276:23.23]Like, look, I've been there before.
[276:25.59]I purchased, like, the $39 Keurig and thought it was gross.
[276:28.63]And I was like, whoa, black coffee sucks.
[276:30.17]I don't want this.
[276:36.45]What a hipster.
[276:37.76]No, I'm not.
[276:38.30]I drink Dunkin' Donuts.
[276:39.66]I drink Dunkin' Donuts coffee.
[276:44.24]Don't call me a hipster.
[276:45.14]Call me a construction worker because that's the kind of coffee that I drink.
[276:49.33]Hey, what do we got here?
[276:51.07]It's just a black coffee.
[276:53.95]Nothing in it.
[276:54.75]Just a medium.
[276:56.67]And I drink it really, really slow all day.
[277:04.21]Don't call me a hipster.
[277:05.35]Call me a contractor.
[277:12.71]What a normie.
[277:16.04]Get out of here.

[278:09.08]Life sucks and you don't get to have any fun anymore.
[278:11.22]You're an 18 year old.
[278:12.14]Enjoy yourself.
[278:12.86]God damn it.
[278:30.25]Calm down.
[278:32.82]Turned 30?
[278:33.18]I turned 30 and all of a sudden I can't lift up TVs.
[278:43.16]What do you mean?
[278:43.66]What?
[278:43.78]You think I'm making a joke?
[278:46.53]No, I'm good for 32.
[278:48.19]Alright.
[278:49.23]Let me tell you guys.
[278:50.41]I know plenty of 32 year olds and wowie.
[278:53.29]Wowie.
[278:58.25]You know how many posts like 28 year olds that I know and I you take one look and you go wowie I ain't that guy Thought I was 45 You know how fucking good I would look for 45.
[279:22.13]I wish I was no I don't shut up Don't I don't say I'm if I was 45
[279:27.44]You're talking about like front page of model magazine if I was 45.
[279:33.00]I don't have gray hair.
[279:41.79]My hair's not gray.
[279:42.73]My hair looks fantastic for 45.
[279:52.25]I'm not that guy.
[279:54.62]Because you're bald.
[279:55.40]You know how much hair I have on my head?
[280:00.29]Falling at 32.
[280:01.75]Let me just tell you guys, let me bring a little bit of reality to most of you here, okay?
[280:07.35]Let me show a little reality for you.
[280:10.03]If you are a man, and you are over the age of 30, and you still don't have a receding hairline,
[280:19.59]You made it.
[280:21.14]That's one of the good ones there.
[280:23.14]You know, because most people at 25 plus, especially 30, 32, all your fucking hair is gone.
[280:29.36]I know a lot.
[280:30.15]You know how many 32 year olds I know where it's all their hair is gone.
[280:33.25]All of it.
[280:45.72]I'm on the, I am on my body, right?
[280:47.98]Let me tell you something.
[280:49.20]I was thinking, I was going to tweet this, but then I thought, no, this is awful.
[280:51.72]I'm not going to tweet this.
[280:52.34]I'll just say it on stream.
[280:53.46]So here's my current health plan here.
[280:56.44]And it's weird.
[280:57.64]I have this epiphany where, so I've been drinking.
[281:03.16]a smoothie or a juice every day this is place that I just love it's great I love all the stuff there they make an awesome smoothie they make an awesome uh bunch of different juices they blend right there in front of you and it's like 10 bucks right I get one every day and the more that I thought about this it's like I have like a reverse cigarette habit I order a pack of cigarettes monetarily worth of these smoothies every day so I am a reverse cigarette addict
[281:34.40]Same amount of money comes out of my bank account.
[281:41.51]It's an upside down cigarette.
[281:43.21]I still spend it though.
[281:44.63]And people say like, no, no, excuse me.
[281:47.27]Don't you buy those cigarettes.
[281:49.91]You're wasting money every day.
[281:52.11]You're smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.
[281:54.11]What are you insane?
[281:56.77]I'm spending the same amount of money on cigarettes.
[281:59.64]Buying like green juices.
[282:07.52]Buy a blender.
[282:08.80]I tried it on my own.
[282:11.60]You can't make... Listen, here's the thing about juicing.
[282:14.82]You can't realistically... Nobody here... Don't even try to tell me... That you are prepared... To like... Shave a beet.
[282:24.11]Three of them.
[282:25.47]Cut up a banana.
[282:27.49]Take an avocado.
[282:28.85]Split it in half.
[282:29.83]Pull out the seed.
[282:31.99]It takes about like 25 minutes of prep time to juice.
[282:39.78]So, I'd rather just have somebody just... I could just stare at them make it for 20 minutes.
[282:46.56]No, no frozen fruit.
[282:47.66]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[282:49.59]Absolutely not.
[282:54.79]And plus, I guess what?
[282:57.03]Alright, fine.
[282:57.49]You guys want to come at me with this?
[282:59.13]You know what?
[282:59.43]You could buy cigarettes for 10 bucks.
[283:01.33]Or you could also roll up computer paper.
[283:05.20]Like, put some fucking cream cheese in it and smoke that too.
[283:09.48]But no!
[283:10.84]You want... You could roll your own cigarettes and spend way less money on... Buy tobacco, roll your own cigarettes.
[283:16.19]Why don't you do that?
[283:17.45]No, you buy the Marlboros that are behind the counter.
[283:21.19]You could roll your own damn cigarettes.
[283:23.55]Nobody does that.
[283:30.52]No, don't smoke.
[283:38.36]Thinking face.
[283:44.39]Hipsters smoke.
[283:50.01]Don't smoke.
[283:51.93]I was gonna... Okay, everything I just said, I was gonna tweet.
[283:55.75]But there's no way I could format it into making the reverse cigarette joke.
[284:01.62]In a Twitter... I couldn't do it.
[284:03.58]I deleted it like three times.
[284:06.34]That couldn't fit it.
[284:09.56]It was so long and it was like, people are going to be like, shut the fuck up.
[284:12.36]Like, I don't care.
[284:12.98]We have a shipping container with a premium tobacco and a couple stacks of printing paper.
[284:26.99]Twit longer.

[286:27.71]Will do, man.
[286:30.13]Thank you for your nearly $50 in contributions to this stream.
[286:37.24]We're looking forward to hearing from you in chat.
[286:40.82]Hey, Dubsky dude, thanks for the two bucks.
[286:42.30]Hey, Jerma, some fat, sweaty biker guy asked me to get this message to you.
[286:45.40]It sounds pretty urgent.
[286:49.06]What is this?
[286:49.36]Alright, make sure this is muted.
[287:04.77]Oh, God.
[287:05.27]Okay, hold on.
[287:06.79]Hold on.
[287:12.13]I'm going to unmute it.
[287:13.73]Hold on.
[287:14.79]Please don't tell me you say something terrible here.
[287:18.11]J-Jerba.
[287:19.87]J-Jerba.
[287:21.09]Listen up, O. We got a big problem here.
[287:25.77]Stop reading bits for a second.
[287:28.35]Put the bits on hold because the fate of the entire Jermiverse is at stake.
[287:33.89]Oh, everyone needs to hear this, especially TwitchTat.
[287:36.93]Oh, yeah, you put them on the line, too.
[287:38.70]I am the Biair from the future.
[287:42.90]And in my timeline, everything sucks.
[287:46.26]You see, Gerber, when you killed Santa, you set motion events that have caused societies we know to collapse.
[287:53.34]Everybody knows that Biairs collect pogs, and Santa deserves make the pogs.
[287:58.78]But now there's no Santa, so that means no more pogs.
[288:02.26]and now 600 million bears are fighting over each other's pogs.
[288:06.96]They've turned the entire world into one giant bar fight.
[288:11.27]It's kinda like Fallout, but with lots of fat guys throwing things.
[288:14.51]Gerber, Gerber, you gotta fix this.
[288:17.11]You gotta make sure this future never comes to pass.
[288:20.25]You gotta bring back Santa in your own time.
[288:23.67]There's another minute.
[288:53.41]You fuckin' asshole.
[289:21.78]All that to get that in the end?
[289:25.81]Is that why we had this?
[289:34.61]That was on point, man.
[289:35.58]Thanks a lot for that.
[289:39.56]That was an 80s wrestling promo.
[289:45.72]That was on point.
[289:53.17]There's never been proven that I ever hurt any person by that name on the stream, though.
[290:01.35]The Bienta.
[290:04.07]Oh, here's the link.
[290:05.62]Thank you so much.
[290:08.50]We gotta get the link.
[290:10.84]Yeah, from the future.
[290:15.88]Here you go.
[290:16.46]Here it is.
[290:19.06]Take a look.
[290:20.12]Take a listen.
[290:21.69]Take a look.
[290:27.62]Thank you for that.
[290:28.10]That was fucking... That was great.
[290:33.10]Hey, uh, here we go.
[290:34.34]Flank Tank.
[290:37.64]$50 again from Flank Tank.
[290:39.20]In two $25 segments.
[290:43.14]Thank you, Flank Tank.
[290:44.36]And the first of these messages is, now that you've seen the androids in Detroit become human, have you heard of a game called Nier Automata?
[290:54.18]It's like a faster Bloodborne mixed with something like Monster Hunter Bayonetta.
[290:57.30]The game starts off very strong, but unfortunately it is one of those the longer you play it, the better it gets type of game.
[291:03.63]It's about 20 to 25 hours total, spanning three characters with multiple endings.
[291:08.58]And also...
[291:10.38]Some people tend to lose interest on part two.
[291:14.04]LUL, which is understandable, but those who get to part three can vouch.
[291:18.56]Feels bad, man.
[291:20.28]The story and OST are incredible, and it's one of the best games I've ever played.
[291:23.86]I can't recommend it enough.
[291:25.92]I implore you to try it.
[291:27.50]If you played it on stream at some point, I might explode from excitement.
[291:33.28]Um, I have never played it.
[291:37.94]Isn't Nier a series that was from a long time ago?
[291:45.98]I'll give it a look.
[291:47.84]Sounds like it might be up my alley with the whole... I mean, you said Bloodborne, and all of a sudden, you know, my tail goes up when you say that.
[291:53.44]And my ears, and my ears go... My tail starts wagging.
[291:57.36]Fucking goddammit.
[291:58.70]Why did I just have to say that?
[292:01.84]Whatever.
[292:04.78]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the 150 bucks.
[292:07.64]That's a lot of money.
[292:08.64]Fuck.
[292:14.34]Yeah, whatever.
[292:15.53]Whatever.
[292:16.07]It was a reference to... I have a dog, okay?
[292:18.15]I like dogs.
[292:20.33]I'm not allowed to like dogs and make references to dogs and animals.
[292:28.19]Thank you, Maisykit, for the $1.
[292:29.83]I am replaying the new chapter of the Little Nightmares DLC.
[292:32.19]I was curious whether you were interested in streaming it at some point.
[292:37.25]No, probably not.
[292:37.81]I mean, Little Nightmares was cool for what it was, but I don't think I'd want to go back to it.
[292:45.92]But thank you, though.
[292:46.42]Thank you, SirFeeling, for the $1.
[292:47.72]What can I say?
[292:50.10]Famous quote.
[292:52.28]SkeletonToes, thanks for the $3. $3.
[292:55.93]Can he maybe give you some words of encouragement?
[292:57.94]Love you, man.
[293:20.73]well skeleton toes thanks for being around for as long as you have uh do not worry about sending me money take care of yourself uh but if you're still here and still listening um words of encouragement wise just do what you gotta do right sometimes you get dealt shit cards but that doesn't mean that you can't push forward and try right
[293:52.89]Every one of us here is pulling for you.
[293:57.05]Doctors and medicine has progressed so far in the last even ten years.
[294:08.38]Send all of your love to Skeleton Toes right now.
[294:12.19]Send it all.
[294:12.85]All of it.
[294:25.56]But it always saddens me to know that people are going through problems.
[294:35.57]I wish that they didn't exist.
[294:38.43]I really do.
[294:42.05]But, like I said, in the game of poker, the game of blackjack, even if you have a bad hand, you can still... The dealer can still bust in blackjack.
[294:53.24]Keep playing.
[294:57.43]We all wish you the best, man.
[295:04.03]Let us know how it goes.
[295:14.12]But Skeleton Toes, best of luck.
[295:17.00]Much love.
[295:21.84]And moving on from that Never Trust a Purple, thank you for the $10.
[295:30.39]They say, I love whiskey.
[295:32.01]Could drink it all night.
[295:33.15]Five bottles of whiskey a night.
[295:34.57]Just enough to loosen me up.
[295:35.89]That's too much.
[295:36.47]That's too much whiskey.
[295:45.15]You never want to take in that much whiskey.
[295:50.89]I mean, hold on a second.
[295:51.67]Are you like... You're not like James and the Giant Peach, right?
[295:54.92]Are you the Peach?
[295:56.26]Because if you're that big, then... If you're like 60 feet tall...
[296:00.23]You know like Andre the Giant?
[296:01.31]Like if you're like an Andre the Giant type guy and you can drink like a bottle of alcohol, then, you know, it depends on how huge you are.
[296:08.30]You might be one of those people that's like 13 feet tall.
[296:10.30]I don't know.
[296:11.84]But thank you, Purple.
[296:14.82]Uh, Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[296:17.18]Well, I used my last bits on the previous message I sent, but I bought more just to say that you are nearly, uh, you are nearly dying from a giant.
[296:25.62]CRT TV is the highlight of this stream.
[296:29.89]Oh, and me nearly dying from the CRT TV.
[296:33.01]90 pounds.
[296:33.47]No, it's not.
[296:34.11]It was like 200-something.
[296:36.36]I didn't get there in time.
[296:38.26]I missed the QTE to be able to show you the scale in time.
[296:43.18]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[296:44.16]I'll have an appletini in the girliest drink you have.
[296:49.40]So that's two appletinis.
[296:50.77]What is this?
[296:51.17]What?
[296:54.61]I don't drink appletinis.
[296:59.09]I don't drink Appletinis.
[297:00.76]I drink whiskey.
[297:03.30]Not on the rocks.
[297:04.52]Just a little bit of water.
[297:06.06]One splash of water.
[297:07.38]Two Fingers.
[297:11.22]And I can tell how many barrels it was in.
[297:12.85]If you give me anything besides a single barrel of whiskey, I'll spit it directly back in the bartender's face.
[297:22.59]And I'll be like, how dare you?
[297:25.76]What is this shithole you call a bar?
[297:32.52]Oh my god, it stinks.
[297:33.92]It stinks.
[297:34.90]Get it away from me, and I'll leave.
[297:37.12]And then I'll get arrested.
[297:44.07]But thank you, CluelessSniper, for the $1.
[297:45.61]Can we please get Dr. Schmoygan in the next Jerma Rumble?
[297:49.41]You might see him again.
[297:51.17]Who knows?
[297:53.58]On your next birthday, when you blow out the candles, wish for Dr. Schmoygan to reappear.
[297:58.41]You know, wishes can't come true.
[298:01.00]They can come true, not can't.
[298:02.62]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[298:03.78]I completely blanked on the whole stream.
[298:04.96]Can you do it again?
[298:05.50]Uh, yeah.
[298:08.38]I'll do it again for you.
[298:10.28]So if you click the videos page right now, and then refresh and then click that spot, I will do the whole thing again for you.
[298:16.53]And I will get it exactly verbatim, get the whole thing.
[298:21.05]That's how you have to do it, though.
[298:24.86]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[298:26.20]Well, disregard those last bits.
[298:30.84]And then Dr. Clay again, thanks for the $1.
[298:33.08]I once had a dream where I was a guy working in the control tower at an airport.
[298:37.83]And an incredibly statically transmission came on the radio.
[298:41.45]All I could hear through the static was, this is... I grabbed the radio and asked them to repeat.
[298:47.81]The person replies, just remembering.
[298:49.87]Just remember my name.
[298:52.24]And then they crashed.
[298:53.14]The worst part, I do not even know what their name was.
[298:57.40]Also, halfway through the dream, it went into third person because I saw the helicopter as if it was shot from a movie.
[299:05.93]Holy shit.
[299:06.99]Well, dreams are strange.
[299:09.79]They really are.
[299:11.45]They make no sense.
[299:14.17]Thank you, AbortionSark, for the $1.40.

[299:37.37]Can we scare something somebody after the stream No, I'm not scaring anybody
[299:45.96]Also, have you read my $30.10 donation yet?
[299:50.38]I'll link it again if you haven't.
[299:51.90]It was the fruit thing, right?
[299:55.08]I'm not scaring people.
[299:58.08]I'm not one of those guys that's gonna scare somebody.
[300:07.64]But anyways, thank you, Bobboy.
[300:11.68]Etalyx?
[300:12.42]Oh yeah, Etalyx is here.
[300:15.07]What did Etalyx say?
[300:18.59]Oh, hold on a minute.
[300:19.36]I can answer that question.
[300:21.04]I'll do it right now.
[300:21.60]Hey, Etalyx, thanks for the $1, Etalyx.
[300:24.06]Which game do you find more fun, Vampyr or The Surge?
[300:28.66]Um, well, here's the thing, Etalyx.
[300:33.56]I would not give The Surge to my worst enemy.
[300:41.09]The Surge is so far below what I would consider a playable experience.
[300:50.60]Absolutely not.
[300:55.21]I've never gotten more upset besides the Evil Within 2.
[301:02.99]No.
[301:03.61]The Vampyr by 500,000%.
[301:04.80]I didn't even... I liked the Vampyr.
[301:13.64]I actually was kind of enjoying the game.
[301:16.29]But everybody in chat...
[301:18.84]Everybody in chat like fucking hated it.
[301:21.96]It was like I was burning witches at the stake.
[301:34.49]I didn't hate the game.
[301:37.21]You can't make that comparison.
[301:38.65]Like the Surge, I fucking visibly was angry at the Surge.
[301:42.75]I was like having fun in Vampyr.
[301:46.78]I would turn I would look over at the chat every like five minutes and it would just be like it would be like oh my god like this game this game sucks boring shitty game so eventually you know like eventually when enough people are holding flames to the building the building's gonna burn down like I'm looking out my window right now and there are like 2 000 people with flamethrowers outside my house eventually it's gonna catch and the building burns
[302:18.24]Then I come up with a pitchfork, just like swing it.
[302:25.64]Yeah, I blanked out a few times, but whatever.
[302:27.56]I mean, the game's boring, but was it bad?
[302:29.76]No, it was fun.
[302:31.47]We were eating people.
[302:32.39]We were figuring out funny stories.
[302:40.69]I remember downloading that stream to watch on my lunch break at work, and I was so pissed off because the stream sucked.
[302:48.22]No.
[302:49.24]That game sucked.
[302:50.64]That game sucked.
[303:00.91]That game... I'm getting flashbacks right now.
[303:17.93]Alright, we're almost done.
[303:21.28]Thank you to Zarina Alexandra for the $1.
[303:25.26]Here's your fun historical fact of the day.
[303:30.12]Uh... In the 1650s, as the Russian Empire colonized eastern Siberia, they came into contact with the Chinese.
[303:38.65]As a gesture of good faith, they sent the Chinese.
[303:45.87]Sent them where?
[303:46.59]Where?
[303:51.24]The Chinese saw this as a Russia committing itself to China as a vessel and asked them to pay tribute.
[303:57.93]But since no one in the Russian could read Chinese, they ignored it.
[304:07.83]1650.
[304:09.37]Somewhere in the Russian Empire.
[304:14.38]Imagine unironically being Etalyx.
[304:18.54]What are you talking about?
[304:26.14]Why is that making me laugh?
[304:28.59]What the fuck are you talking about?
[304:34.09]I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[304:37.23]What is that supposed to mean?
[304:39.88]And yes, I am playing with like four discs in my hands.
[304:42.70]These are the ones that I tried to juggle earlier.
[304:44.40]But I don't even know what that means.
[304:51.12]Thank you, Serena, though.
[304:52.03]Thank you, Tingy, for the $1.
[304:53.27]So when you're 45, you're going to be this guy.
[304:55.03]I forgot about this video.
[304:56.45]That guy's terrifying.
[305:16.52]Thank you, Tingy.
[305:18.12]Thank you, SirFeeling, for the $1.
[305:19.48]Jeremiah, make sure you watch the Giant Dad video before playing DSR to get yourself into the right headspace.
[305:28.75]What is DSR?
[305:32.17]Dance Dance Revolution?
[305:34.85]Dance... Dance Serious Revolution.
[305:38.23]What is this?
[305:38.69]What is DSR?
[305:42.67]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[305:43.57]That's Dark Souls Remastered.
[305:45.13]Okay.
[305:48.29]Dark Souls Revolution.
[305:53.24]Dance Souls Remixed.
[305:55.64]Giant Dad.
[305:56.52]Oh, I remember those.
[306:03.36]I will never do a Dance Dance Revolution stream.
[306:06.23]You think, like, me dropping a TV on myself is gonna be like, ooh, yikes.
[306:11.83]What about me dancing with a fucking pad in front of me?
[306:13.91]No way.
[306:21.20]Thank you RD Elite for the 10 bucks.
[306:24.80]Appreciate it.
[306:25.34]Thanks for the $10 here.
[306:26.56]Turn this into an IRL combing stream.
[306:28.22]A little too late for that.
[306:29.20]A little too late for that.
[306:32.28]But thank you RD Elite for the $10.
[306:34.22]Didn't you say you hated Dark Souls 1?
[306:39.58]No, I never hated Dark Souls 1.
[306:42.86]I just couldn't get into it.
[306:45.43]I like the Demon's Souls and Bloodborne type of pacing and hub world more than I like Dark Souls 1 or Dark Souls 2.
[306:56.22]Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, and Demon's Souls have that collective hub, which I enjoy it more than the other way.
[307:08.03]But, thank you RD Elite.
[307:12.64]RD Elite again with $5 here.
[307:14.84]$15 total right here.
[307:16.70]Comb stream, please.
[307:19.12]I don't have a comb down here.
[307:20.12]I can't do it.
[307:21.54]How about this?
[307:21.92]We'll start the next stream.
[307:22.90]I'll put a comb in the camera lens.
[307:29.78]Dark Souls 1 greater than sign DDR than DDLC.
[307:33.99]Oh, you're doing the... Oh, yeah.
[307:38.11]Hold on.
[307:38.37]I got to do mine.
[307:38.85]I got to do mine.
[307:39.41]Hold on.
[307:41.40]I'm gonna do my list.
[307:46.96]Hold on.
[307:50.69]Hold on.
[308:07.44]Okay, here you go.
[308:07.98]Here's my quintessential list.
[308:09.56]Here it is.
[308:10.02]Bingo.
[308:18.37]Well, the game music is still playing.
[308:19.83]Alright, it's off.
[308:24.62]I got it.
[308:25.14]We're good.
[308:31.91]Imagine unironically not finishing Dark Souls 1.
[308:35.60]That's a bad... It's not bad.
[308:37.06]It's not bad.
[308:37.58]Demon's Souls is better than Dark Souls 2.
[308:41.22]I can assure that.
[308:42.16]I can assure you.
[308:45.29]Dark Souls 2 is not as good as Demon's Souls.
[308:50.23]And Demon's Souls, I think, may have been better than Dark Souls 3.
[308:54.99]It's pretty close, though.
[308:58.30]That's very close.
[308:58.96]That's a toss-up.
[309:06.70]Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 2, My Barbie Fucking Funhouse, and then Dark Souls 1 is what you said during your Demon's Souls stream.
[309:14.34]I did?
[309:15.76]Well, I flipped it, alright?
[309:17.02]I got, I, I, I, it was close enough.
[309:22.04]Hey, thank you Sir Phelan for the $1 maggot head kick run in Dark Souls Remastered or I unsub.
[309:28.43]I don't know what that is.
[309:30.23]But thank you Sir Phelan again for the $1.
[309:31.59]On the juice thing, basically you're just lazy and don't want to make things yourself.
[309:37.84]Welcome to commerce.
[309:40.62]Think of all the scenarios that what you just said can apply to dozens and dozens of industries.
[309:49.47]You're explaining like capitalism right now.
[309:52.95]Sure, you could also make the clothes that you're wearing right now, but you bought those at Hot Topic.
[309:57.85]You could also go make the shoes that you're wearing too, but you bought them at Foot Locker.
[310:03.30]Didn't feel like making your own shoes?
[310:05.16]Why?
[310:05.40]Why?
[310:12.03]That's whole industry.
[310:13.15]You're explaining industry.
[310:16.91]How did you know?
[310:19.75]I don't shop at Hot Topic.
[310:20.99]Hot Topic is just like a joke store with like... Never mind.
[310:24.85]This is gross.
[310:30.24]This is what... Look, look, look, look.
[310:32.80]you go into hot topic this is what you do you go you walk around in a circle and you stop at the posters wow cool look at those posters spider-man's cool I guess keep you don't buy it don't you don't buy them you don't you don't purchase those you walk by where's the t-shirt wall oh wow cool
[310:51.63]is like a kitty on that one with an axe in his hand cool and then every band I've ever heard of that you know was on the top 10 last year they're all here let's keep going what else is over here wow this is interesting not gonna buy any of those by the way uh this is oh whoa okay here's a bunch of dildos and like funny bachelorette party sex things whoa cool
[311:15.28]Nice.
[311:15.68]Alright.
[311:16.00]That's funny, I guess.
[311:16.90]Let's go to the back.
[311:18.12]Here are a bunch of neon laser light devices and lava lamps.
[311:22.62]Cool.
[311:23.14]This is... Oh, that's interesting.
[311:27.18]I'll never buy one of these.
[311:28.82]Why would I own one of these?
[311:29.80]Am I going to have a party in my house and put like lights on the ceiling?
[311:33.86]Let's keep going.
[311:35.40]Let's take... Oh, here we are.
[311:37.10]We've made it to the spinning rack of tags and names things.
[311:42.18]Oh, like Jake.
[311:43.88]Jeremy.
[311:45.14]Tag.
[311:45.90]Look at here.
[311:46.30]Here's this.
[311:46.64]Look at this bumper sticker.
[311:47.80]Let's spin it around like a sunglasses thing.
[311:49.88]Oh, look at that.
[311:50.58]I can put these on my head.
[311:51.62]And then you leave.
[312:02.56]You don't buy anything.
[312:05.39]I am convinced that stores like Hot Topic, stores like Spencer Gifts...
[312:09.69]they just they just like the CEO of those companies like launders money between them and like pretends to purchase things they just like spoof their numbers one person will go into expenses or go into a hot topic and buy a band t-shirt once a week
[312:40.02]Oh, isn't that funny?
[312:40.90]Oh, whoa, what's this over here?
[312:43.02]Funny fake turn-your-mouth blue chewing gum for 80 cents?
[312:47.51]Sure, I'll buy that for fun.
[312:48.95]I'm the one customer that bought something here last week.
[313:02.66]But those places have to exist.
[313:05.08]Hot Topic, Spencer's, those little novelty stores, they have to exist because they are the exhibit of the mall.
[313:12.32]You can't have a mall without those stupid exhibit stores where you just walk around and look at all the weird shit and leave.
[313:17.37]It's a museum.
[313:18.11]It has to be there.
[313:21.67]You need to go look at like the funny thing that you like, the funny guy that you put the coin in his ass and he goes, oh, that's funny.
[313:28.83]I got to get one of those for my office.
[313:30.07]When are you going to buy that?
[313:31.25]Who owns that?
[313:33.69]Nobody owns the put the coin in the guy's asshole fart sound desk coin machine.
[313:42.21]No one owns it.
[313:53.36]I'm telling you.
[313:56.38]What am I talking about?
[313:57.26]You just take a look.
[314:01.90]All those dumb little novelty things, you walk by them, you could probably drag your finger across like the funny, gross, dumb shit that's there and you get a layer of dust on your finger.
[314:11.53]Cause they haven't probably even- That thing probably hasn't been picked up in 12 years.
[314:26.88]Just Google sticking coin in guy's ass toy.
[314:30.70]Hold on.
[314:32.38]I'm going to regret this search.
[314:35.65]Novelty fart coin ass.
[314:41.87]Oh, everybody thinks I'm an idiot.
[314:44.53]Everybody thinks I'm a fucking dickhead.
[314:47.67]Jerma, you need to seriously consider what the fuck is wrong with you.
[314:51.84]Oh, yeah?
[314:52.92]Why don't we take a look?
[314:55.01]Let's just take a gander, guys.
[314:58.38]Hold on a minute.
[315:01.74]Let's just take a look.
[315:17.30]Well, what do you know?
[315:19.75]Hmm.
[315:25.21]Somebody... Somebody stop me!
[315:28.71]Somebody stop me here!
[315:39.98]Told you.
[315:41.24]Everybody thinks I'm crazy.
[315:47.66]You bet $100 that Etalyx owns one of those.
[315:51.59]Yeah, but here's my point, right?
[315:54.69]Nobody owns that.
[315:57.55]That doesn't serve any purpose.
[316:01.23]It's just, why would you buy that?
[316:04.25]You're gonna gift that to somebody?
[316:05.63]They're not gonna put it on their desk.
[316:07.07]Why would I put that there?
[316:09.09]People barely put those Fun Pops on their desk of fucking Iron Man.
[316:12.66]You're gonna put an asshole fart coin machine there?
[316:23.65]Spencer wouldn't ban me for advertising a Spencer's toy.
[316:30.99]I own it.
[316:31.59]I've been trying to tell you.
[316:32.69]But when was the last time you used it?
[316:36.34]I guarantee you, you haven't used it.
[316:42.08]You probably used it once and then put it back inside like the closet shelf that you have it in.
[316:50.55]Anyways, let's move on.
[316:54.61]Hey, Jiggly Ribs, thanks for the... That's... Thank you.
[316:59.79]Hey, Tay, Tay106, thanks for the $1.
[317:02.61]Yo, Jerma, I always catch these streams after the gaming, but you know I'm going to be on that VOD grind tomorrow to catch up with all the new memes.
[317:12.94]Thank you, Tay.
[317:16.74]Enjoy the stream.
[317:18.40]Hopefully you enjoy it.
[317:19.92]Game was fairly interesting.
[317:22.47]but you know people in here might tend to disagree with it don't watch the Vaughn come on don't blow it thank you to sir feline for the one dollar I never took you for such a critic Jeremy so much anger for such a compact man I'm not I'm not a critic I'm not angry
[317:46.07]You know, I speak... I speak fluent bullshit.
[317:49.45]No, no, no.
[317:49.79]I speak fluent bullshit, detector.
[317:51.87]Fucking... I just... I speak... I was trying to go for a thing there, and I've ruined it.
[317:58.66]I was trying to swing around there and do like a meta non sequitur, and I flipped it around.
[318:02.52]Doesn't even matter.
[318:06.24]Thank you, Sir Feline, again, for the one dollar.
[318:09.32]Appreciate that.
[318:11.70]Thank you, uh... Thank you, Twardungle, for the $1.
[318:15.83]Just came here to say, whiskey tastes like if you took rotten coffee grounds and boiled it.
[318:20.80]Sounds pretty good to me.
[318:24.16]Thank you, Bobboy, for the $5.
[318:25.34]Hey, Jerma, don't know if you've gotten around to reading my $30.10 Google Doc.
[318:28.24]Otherwise, have a good day.
[318:50.84]Gin's better than whiskey?
[318:51.82]Get out.
[318:52.30]You're not modded.
[318:53.16]Unmodded.
[318:54.72]Unmodded.
[318:56.44]Did you just say gin was better than whiskey?
[319:01.21]Gin is disgusting.
[319:03.53]Disgusting.
[319:05.97]It's like drinking Pine Sol.
[319:07.77]No, it's awful.
[319:08.95]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[319:16.16]That's it.
[319:16.86]I'm unmodded.
[319:18.04]And I'm modding the next person that says anything in chat.
[319:23.55]Ah, it was him.
[319:24.61]Yeah, he's remodded.
[319:27.27]Yeah, Moo, Moo, you were the first person after I said that.
[319:29.43]You've been remodded.
[319:30.23]Thank you for playing.
[319:41.24]Thank you.
[319:44.06]Sir Feline, thanks for the mandala.
[319:45.48]Why so much the Surge hate?
[319:48.22]I found its combat pretty good.
[319:50.27]Certainly felt better than Vampyr looked.
[319:52.79]Ugh.
[319:57.74]Oh, it's okay.
[319:59.36]Just count backwards from 10.
[320:00.72]Okay, I'm alright.
[320:08.50]No, that's... Look, the thing about opinions and the thing about video games is it's very subjective.
[320:14.32]If you like something and I don't, that's fine.
[320:16.54]We're two completely different people.
[320:18.15]Two completely different ideas.
[320:22.98]One of us obviously is way, way smarter.
[320:26.92]I'm just kidding.
[320:27.80]I'm kidding.
[320:28.74]I'm kidding.
[320:30.12]If you liked the Surge, then I'm glad you did.
[320:38.95]You can't be a mod.
[320:40.59]Two different timelines.
[320:44.41]No, but for real.
[320:46.09]Like what you like.
[320:46.69]It's all good.
[320:49.49]Dr. Clay, thank you for the $1.
[320:51.93]Just play whatever you want.
[320:52.83]It's your stream.
[320:53.55]As long as you're having fun, that's all that matters.
[320:55.73]Also, I am considering making a video game based on some of my dreams.
[320:59.20]They are really interesting sometimes.
[321:02.60]I wish you luck.
[321:04.10]Go for it, man.
[321:04.64]Do it.
[321:07.70]But... Yes, it is my stream.
[321:11.40]This is Jerma985, the Twitch channel.
[321:14.95]But...
[321:17.27]you know, it's my stream and I'm going to do what I feel like doing.
[321:23.10]But also, if the audience that is receiving this broadcast, most of them are not enjoying the thing that I'm doing, I'm going to do it anyways and do it as long as I possibly can to cause the maximum amount of irritation.
[321:42.71]No, um,
[321:44.81]You know, I take into consideration everything people say.
[321:46.81]I don't want people to be bored on my streams.
[321:49.89]I want them to be... I want people to think they were worth watching.
[321:54.12]I don't want people to say that or think that, right?
[321:57.88]I don't think anybody does.
[322:03.90]Anybody that's broadcasting on this platform is like, yeah, I can't wait for people to be bored today.
[322:08.47]So, you know, I do think about it a lot.
[322:15.79]If we stopped giving you money, you'd be screwed.
[322:18.25]We own you.
[322:22.81]That was rough.
[322:26.99]Thank you, Maxie, for the $1.
[322:29.80]Hey, everybody, just got here.
[322:30.80]My blade costume took a little longer to make than expected.
[322:34.26]Did I miss all the edgy vampire shit?
[322:36.24]Yes, you did.
[322:38.36]You did.
[322:38.62]You're welcome.
[322:41.62]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[322:43.32]Still don't get my joke, jermaPluto.
[322:45.80]Didn't get the joke.
[322:48.88]I mean... I don't know.
[322:52.17]I... I don't know.
[322:52.49]I'm on the spot right now.
[322:53.85]Should I try juggling again?
[322:54.81]No, I'm not doing that.
[322:57.53]What the piggy bank fart plumber's asshole thing?
[323:00.25]I think that was a joke, right?
[323:02.93]Thank you, Spreo.
[323:06.16]Zarina, Alexander, thanks for the $1.
[323:07.86]So my message was supposed to say...
[323:10.44]that the Russians sent the Chinese a gift.
[323:13.46]During time of the Ming and later Qing dynasties, China was surrounded by tributary states that all paid tribute to the Chinese as they were believed to hold the mandate of heaven.
[323:24.45]When a dynasty lost the mandate, they lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, so the Russians ignoring it was seen as a no-no-no by the Chinese court.
[323:34.20]I see.
[323:34.92]Alright.
[323:41.58]No, did you see what I said?
[323:47.28]I can't put Dark Souls 1 anywhere because I got like 30% of the way through the game.
[323:53.36]I've beaten all of Dark Souls 2 and all the DLC.
[323:56.17]I've beaten all of Bloodborne, all the DLC, all the DLC for Dark Souls 3, all the everything.
[324:01.89]I've beaten all the Demon's Souls.
[324:06.49]I can't say that for Dark Souls, so I can't put it anywhere.
[324:09.58]eventually over the next couple of weeks we will place it accordingly thank you Bob boy for the one dollar alright the pre-stream document from the other day was wild here it is restored to the before it went to crap version for the fifth time
[324:41.73]Alright, let's raid the dock.
[324:42.99]Come on.
[324:51.04]Why can I not... Hold on.
[324:57.38]Open!
[324:59.18]Open!
[324:59.78]Open folder!
[325:09.37]Alright, here we go.
[325:11.81]Let's see what this says.
[325:16.61]Pre-stream party document.
[325:18.33]Okay.
[325:21.10]What the fuck is this?
[325:25.68]What is this?
[325:27.94]This is so much information.
[325:33.02]We suddenly... Etalyx launched a rocket towards Jerma's house.
[325:38.37]I like this is the wrong restore version, but it's also the one with the complete Jerma story on page three.
[325:42.67]Actually, I'll just allow edits.
[325:45.71]Editing is blacked out.
[325:47.89]Okay, episode one of Jerma crap.
[325:49.44]Did you guys just, like, make a giant Google Doc shitpost?
[325:55.90]This Jerma is fucked.
[325:56.86]Ah, someone discovered they could turn to edit.
[325:59.14]Try reloading the document.
[326:00.16]See, that gets you, and instead of suggesting it's grayed out, let's write a one more.
[326:04.25]What the fuck is this?
[326:07.56]Okay, this is a one word, write a story word by word.
[326:10.82]Why do we need music?
[326:12.68]Hey, somebody delete the story.
[326:13.98]Also, I'm anonymous now.
[326:15.09]Take that, hackers.
[326:16.55]This is a recipe for disaster.
[326:17.87]Once upon a time, there was a streamer who has heart and dabs.
[326:21.03]One evening, he was streaming late as usual when suddenly Etalyx launched a rocket towards Jerma's household.
[326:26.33]Jerma panicked when he realized and started to poopoo peepee.
[326:30.12]He grabbed his light gun
[326:31.78]And holstered it at his side.
[326:33.18]He teleported behind Etalyx.
[326:35.30]Nano with a swift movement.
[326:36.86]His fedora properly in place.
[326:38.98]And Karate chopped him to death.
[326:40.52]But Etalyx is... People are deleting.
[326:42.06]Somebody just deleted the whole thing.
[326:44.01]Somebody just deleted all of it.
[326:47.53]It's gone.
[326:50.07]In real time, somebody just removed it.
[326:52.97]No, there it is, okay.
[326:55.27]Etalyx is undead.
[326:56.17]A fedora in place and karate chopped him to death, but Etalyx is undead, so he didn't die, did.
[327:00.83]His power was too much for Jerma to handle alone, thus Otto came along.
[327:04.61]But Etalyx summoned Stara, BibleThump, Jerma's old nemesis, initiating a great battle of tubers, I mean Twitch streamers.
[327:11.64]But what they didn't know is that Jerma was a talented swordsman who wouldn't let anything stand in his path, and yet he was too compact to reach the stars.
[327:18.54]With the realization of his compact C.E., he realized all the dead memes had been banished to the Shadow Realm.
[327:26.31]He realized greatly compact Shadow Realm.
[327:28.77]He counted this down 3, 2, 1...
[327:31.02]The great power of memes held at bay for the last hundred years scared Ster away.
[327:35.50]Jerma did a victorious dab and hugged Otto, and Boo was on the call with Vinny.
[327:40.80]Quick, delete this before he gets here.
[327:42.43]Story saved.
[327:43.01]Okay, continue.
[327:43.63]What, um, you got PogChamp.
[327:48.69]This is like asking, this is, okay, you know those, like, jokes where it's, hey, I had my computer only watch, uh, infomercials, and I came up with this script.
[327:59.16]This is, this is just one of those.
[328:11.44]Post the whole document on a Hot Topic t-shirt.
[328:19.24]Is that based on a true story?
[328:20.56]Yeah, it was.
[328:23.55]People were deleting and editing as I was reading that, by the way.
[328:29.95]Thank you, Bob Boy, for your pre-stream gigantic machine learning shitpost.

[329:52.00]Um... I don't know, not that much.
[329:58.12]You know, I... Enough to be interested, but not really enough to care.

[330:10.58]Restore to fresh start.
[330:11.84]You guys can have fun with your fucking machine meme.
[330:16.40]Enough to be interested, but not enough to panic.
[330:23.59]Are bits a cryptocurrency?
[330:24.91]No, because bits are not on a blockchain or a distributed hash table or a smart contract.
[330:33.81]No.
[330:36.78]Interested.

[331:41.49]Probably not.
[331:43.19]Just a little interested.
[331:44.11]Just a little interested.
[331:46.84]He's in too deep now.
[331:49.93]But thank you for the $5 purple Dark Souls 1 PvP is some of the favorite of my in the whole series Really hoping you do so once you're finished with the game or on your way through it there's some really stupid builds you can get away with in Dark Souls 1 and I'd love to see you doing forest or Ula style PvP.

[332:16.21]Hey Jerma, what's your favorite chicken wing sauce spice?
[332:18.37]I
[332:19.98]Well, my favorite hot sauce is Tabasco.
[332:23.07]Just to put on everything.
[332:25.89]But actually, with heat?
[332:29.53]Um, I don't know.
[332:33.28]Sometimes I go to these local places that have awesome, really hot hot sauces.
[332:38.36]And I'm like, whoa, holy shit, this was great.
[332:41.42]But it's such an obscure company that I never even remember what it is.
[332:47.37]So I can't... I've had a lot that I've really liked.
[332:50.37]But Tabasco is my go-to for everything.
[332:53.90]I love Tabasco.
[332:57.86]You can put Tabasco on everything.
