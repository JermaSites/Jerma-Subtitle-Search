[00:02.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:03.32]Hold on.
[00:04.28]Explain this to me.
[00:06.13]How can... How can I be late if I don't have a schedule right now?
[00:14.29]How can I be late if there's no time that I'm supposed to show up?
[00:21.62]That doesn't make very much logical sense.
[00:29.72]Sorry, I just had to flush the toilet real quick.
[00:34.42]Need to change my offline image.
[00:36.70]Yeah, I think I'm just going to delete it.
[00:39.70]I have it saved.
[00:40.28]I'm going to update it.
[00:42.52]Just haven't been like... That's one of those things... That's like leaving a bottle of water on your desk.
[00:50.49]Or in your kitchen.
[00:51.83]You know what I'm talking about?
[00:54.69]You just leave a half-drank bottle of water.
[00:57.52]It's just sitting in the same spot in the kitchen for like a week.
[01:01.49]And you see it every day.
[01:03.37]And you're looking at it, and you're like, ah, it's, it's, I don't know.
[01:06.97]And you walk away from it.
[01:14.74]I do that, but with, like, five bottles.
[01:18.48]Yeah, that, it's just like a water bottle.
[01:20.60]Like, I see it every day, and I'm like, ah, I need to, I need to, like, I need to move.
[01:25.79]Ah, whatever, I'll see you tomorrow.
[01:34.61]right down the cereal box stream.
[01:36.30]Oh, no, that was a real... Mr. Dunwich, right?
[01:41.56]I'm gonna give credit where credit is due.
[01:46.56]Came up with an amazing idea.
[01:49.02]And I think we're gonna do it.
[01:53.66]So here's the... Before we get started, I gotta just tell you about this brilliant idea.
[01:58.60]So, you know the cereal box puzzles that are on the back of every cereal box?
[02:02.87]Well, not really anymore.
[02:05.27]That was a thing back in, like, they still do it, but not really like they used to.
[02:09.85]Every inch of your cereal box back in the mid-90s was a puzzle.
[02:15.68]Little, like, ladders and things to play with and crosswords and now it's like nutritional information.
[02:22.92]You know what I mean?
[02:23.42]Like, nowadays on the back of the box it's like, well, all whole grains and no trans fats.
[02:28.84]Get that shit out of here.
[02:29.78]I want the puzzles back.
[02:30.72]I want to fucking, like, find the five cuckoo birds.
[02:39.54]Nobody, everyone knows cereal is just dog shit with fucking vitamins injected into it.
[02:46.31]You know what I mean?
[02:46.85]Like, you don't eat a bowl of fucking Captain Crunch and go like, oh, I'm so glad I'm getting my daily C. No.
[02:52.77]That's not how it works.
[03:05.99]Anyways, uh, hi.
[03:07.25]How's everybody doing?
[03:08.00]We're gonna play some more Red Dead today.
[03:10.14]Because I am officially addicted to the game.
[03:14.20]And I think it's very fun.
[03:16.14]And I have the strict policy on this livestream.
[03:19.31]Very strict policy.
[03:21.65]Of... If I'm having fun doing something, I'm gonna do it.
[03:28.39]And we're about to break the four streams in a row.
[03:31.35]Well, actually, no, that's not true.
[03:33.35]Because I played Lethal League for about four hours.
[03:37.16]So then, never mind.
[03:37.84]So this is like the second Red Dead stream in a row, right?
[03:43.97]I don't usually stream the same game more than four or five times in a row.
[03:48.87]So it is still technically legal.
[03:52.44]What's the brilliant idea?
[03:53.36]Well, anyway, so what I want to do, which was very nicely suggested to me, is I'm going to go on eBay and Amazon and maybe find some old retailers.
[04:06.75]And I'm going to get like 30 boxes of cereal.
[04:09.66]And we're going to do the puzzles on the stream.
[04:12.48]And we're going to go over our favorite ones.
[04:13.98]Which one had the most challenging puzzle?
[04:22.00]I'm gonna fill my room with cereal, and we're gonna go one by one.
[04:26.18]We might even do a thing where, okay, like, Cocoa Puffs.
[04:28.05]Here's, like, a Cocoa Puffs box from, like, 1990.
[04:30.75]This is gonna... Hold on a minute.
[04:34.35]Is this gonna cost, like, 10 grand?
[04:36.49]How, like... Okay, Cocoa Puffs.
[04:40.49]Like, old box or something, right?
[04:45.34]Can I, like, buy this?
[04:48.89]Okay, here's one.
[04:49.79]Empty General Mills cereal box, 2009.
[04:52.63]Cocoa Puffs, 2011.
[04:54.14]Yeah, oh yeah, these are 10 bucks though.
[05:01.52]It's gonna cost $10 to buy an empty fucking cereal box from 2007.
[05:07.72]Something about that just seems not worth it.
[05:13.01]That's buying someone's trash.
[05:15.81]that is buying a person's trash out of their trash can for an exorbitant price.
[05:21.08]$10, really?
[05:25.74]That's like, come on, man.
[05:28.06]That's a little much.
[05:32.22]Just make your own puzzles.
[05:34.38]It's $20 for one from 1990.
[05:36.10]It's this no shame in just finding pictures of it all online.
[05:44.25]Oh, fuck.
[05:47.47]You're right.
[05:48.87]That's true.
[05:50.68]You don't have to buy the boxes.
[05:52.42]But I don't... But then I have to eat the cereal, right?
[05:54.70]Isn't that how it works?
[06:00.12]Don't I also then need to eat it?
[06:02.25]And test which puzzles was the... which year was the best?
[06:05.61]Can you eat cereal from like 1990?
[06:10.75]What happens if you eat cereal from like 1992?
[06:21.24]It's pretty bad.
[06:23.52]Well, yeah, at least I'll get my daily C. That's correct.
[06:30.31]Aw, man.
[06:30.79]That's a funny idea, though.
[06:33.17]Anyways, um, yes.
[06:34.34]Yes.
[06:36.75]I just want to play Red Dead.
[06:39.19]And I'm here.
[06:40.75]Last thing we did.
[06:41.37]If you're curious, if you have no idea, we just got the bear.
[06:45.16]We just got the bear.
[06:47.04]By the way, spoiler alert.
[06:49.18]In case anyone has not played this far in the game.
[06:52.02]Just got the bear.
[06:54.16]The legendary bear.
[06:56.38]Okay?
[06:57.75]I know you saw it on the screen already, but
[07:04.59]And now we have this, the funny, definitely guaranteed, every streamer you watch, every single one that comes across this hat will wear it.
[07:13.96]Guaranteed.
[07:14.48]This is like the streamer hat.
[07:19.10]Isn't it?
[07:22.53]Isn't it?
[07:23.83]It's a cool hat.
[07:32.19]Oh, did he drop some frames?
[07:34.19]Uh-oh.
[07:35.81]It was too good to be true.
[07:38.61]We had three days in a row of perfect internet.
[07:40.87]It was too good to be true.
[07:42.59]Clean your PS4.
[07:49.76]Oh, I think it really might have been too good to be true.
[07:53.58]It may have been too good to be true.
[07:58.18]Is it possible?
[07:58.88]Was it too good to be true?
[08:06.26]It looks pretty rough right now.
[08:12.74]We'll see.
[08:13.00]We'll see if it straightens itself up.
[08:18.08]Quick, throw salt over your shoulder.
[08:19.62]I know, really.
[08:20.10]Hmm.
[08:21.68]Hmm.
[08:24.98]Hmm.
[08:37.22]Okay.
[08:38.84]Okay.
[08:41.34]Those are the consequences of streaming last night for 10 hours.
[08:43.92]I know, really.
[08:49.17]Well, we're going to see what happens.
[08:52.13]So, welcome and goodbye, potentially.
[08:58.68]Hasn't happened yet.
[09:01.94]We're just going to go.
[09:04.03]So, I apologize in advance if this is just over before it even begins.
[09:07.40]Let it go, then let's go.
[09:13.56]Yeah, my neck is real stiff.
[09:14.48]I don't even want to stomp on it.
[09:15.72]Uh, that's not what you do.
[09:18.10]You need to get your daily C. You haven't got it yet.
[09:20.06]Uh-oh, this ain't good.
[09:32.57]First of the night.
[09:33.31]No, I'm like looking over at my OBS.
[09:38.37]Time to change the title of the stream.
[09:39.85]That one didn't count.
[09:44.42]I haven't started playing yet.
[09:50.54]I wasn't playing the game.
[09:51.56]I was looking over to see if OBS was stable.
[10:01.06]Okay.
[10:01.98]So, instead of obsessing over the OBS, if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.
[10:07.06]So, here we go.
[10:09.40]Turn on your facecam?
[10:12.71]Why?
[10:21.39]I wanna do, like, a story mission.
[10:23.37]So, let's... We gotta go all the way back here.
[10:29.29]So I'm going to take the stagecoach.
[10:34.61]So I unlocked fast travel.
[10:36.60]Does that mean I can only do fast travel from here?
[10:40.06]Mike is still in jail.
[10:45.16]And he's probably going to be there for a very long time.
[10:53.55]You can fast travel from your camp.
[10:54.89]Okay.
[10:58.00]Well, then I'll take the stagecoach.
[11:00.82]No, Micah's not in jail anymore.
[11:03.07]He's out.
[11:05.75]He's just not happy.
[11:16.52]How we doing?
[11:17.04]I think we're okay.
[11:22.95]Somebody be pissed on the line for a second, but it looks okay from the last couple minutes.
[11:31.75]Knock on wood.
[11:32.87]Okay, let's go.
[11:45.96]Also, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
[11:50.94]but that may have been just the initial little hiccup from me starting my stream because Etalyx is currently streaming too so maybe it was just like oh shit I go yeah I'm fine I'm good I can handle it
[12:21.08]Go to the fence.
[12:23.10]What's the fence got for me now?
[12:31.04]This fence, you mean.
[12:35.30]Do I have?
[12:35.86]Oh, I have the gold bar, right?
[12:39.20]Am I gonna play this online?
[12:40.56]Yes.
[12:42.32]When does it come up?
[12:42.92]When does online come up in this game?
[12:50.90]Oh, he crashed the trinkets.
[12:51.94]Come on, man.
[12:54.42]Let me just, like, take a quick sip.
[13:03.93]Getting my daily C.
[13:26.96]Didn't fall off the fucking horse.
[13:27.94]Didn't fall off the horse.
[13:28.66]You saw it.
[13:44.68]How long did I plan that joke for?
[13:46.08]That is not a joke.
[13:49.10]I'm looking out for my personal health.
[13:52.41]Oh, shit.
[13:53.98]That's not a gold bar.
[13:56.62]That's not a gold bar.
[14:00.60]That's a gold ingot.
[14:01.72]That'll be 300 bucks.
[14:08.73]That's still a lot of money.
[14:09.63]I'll take it.
[14:11.21]Pocket watch.
[14:11.81]Gold pocket watch.
[14:14.45]It's a ring.
[14:17.85]I'm afraid to sell these things.
[14:25.43]How rich is this guy?
[14:27.96]Uh, probably pretty rich.
[14:29.86]Alright, here we go.
[14:33.40]Whoa.
[14:37.16]Okay.
[14:38.74]Legendary cougar, coyote, elk, fox.
[14:43.93]I didn't get the elk antler?
[14:46.59]How did I not get the elk antler?
[14:50.55]Whoa, it's the bram.
[14:51.79]What's this thing do?
[14:54.07]Picking Creeping Thyme, Oregano, and Wild Mint yields two times more herbs.
[14:57.67]Okay.
[15:01.49]And what about the bear?
[15:04.90]Where's my... What happened to my bear claw?
[15:11.02]Oh, shit.
[15:11.76]I need... Quartz Chunk?
[15:20.24]What if I get a Quartz Chunk?
[15:29.30]This one kind of sucks.
[15:33.02]Do I need the ram horn for anything else?
[15:36.24]Or should I just get it?
[15:44.73]What else can I use it for?
[15:52.23]Well, I guess I'm going to get it.
[15:53.25]I can just...
[15:55.68]Okay, I got it.
[15:58.46]I can now pick up stuff better.
[16:00.12]Uh-oh.
[16:05.97]Yikes.
[16:19.43]Is it gonna behave?
[16:20.89]Is the internet gonna behave today?
[16:23.45]Well, I can't get the bear one, so...
[16:26.04]Truth is, ranchers losing money hand over damn fist.
[16:35.02]Well, I will tell you, that is definitely an indicator for things to come.
[16:41.04]I do have my trinket though.
[16:44.04]Scold the internet.
[16:49.60]And while we may not turn off, you may see that a few times.
[16:56.52]I got a lot of money, though.
[16:57.62]What am I going to do with my money?
[17:07.69]Ooh.
[17:16.97]Ooh.
[17:21.68]I can feel it.
[17:22.36]It, like, hurts every time.
[17:31.97]Um... I was gonna go down here.
[17:33.33]I was gonna take the stagecoach from here, right?
[17:41.81]I can hear you, Boiler.
[17:43.75]That's the PS4.
[17:46.43]The regular base PS4 just chugs while playing this game.
[18:03.70]Water yeah, well you're about to hear my blood boil pretty soon here Well the game doesn't run bad on the base ps4, but the hardware the hardware sure does Let's take we'll be taking the train to Go all the way down To here this is Rhodes is there a Rhodes station
[18:38.52]Do I have any bounties?
[18:39.62]Happy to help you start over.
[18:41.17]Good.
[18:41.99]Why don't I just automatically assume that I have a shitload of bounties?
[18:48.09]Hope you have a good trip.
[18:51.51]Rhodes has a station.
[18:52.39]Good.
[19:04.71]That's some good fruit blood.
[19:19.46]Train tickets were expensive back then.
[19:20.70]Yes, they were.
[19:28.31]You always wonder what kind of music I'm into?
[19:29.65]A little bit of funk.
[19:35.06]Electronic.
[19:36.58]I'm really into electronic reggae funk.
[19:39.18]You know what I mean?
[19:55.51]Dutch has asked you don't do anything bad.
[19:57.27]Don't use any weapons and don't yell at anybody.
[20:02.08]Keep your voice down in Rhodes.
[20:05.06]No talking.
[20:06.08]No badgering anybody.
[20:11.00]Random freak.
[20:13.38]I paid for my shit.
[20:15.95]Paid with my body and my mind.

[20:46.20]Nothing but nasty, miserable people.
[20:48.26]Yeah?
[20:48.68]Yeah, ever since them, them Greys moved here.
[20:52.08]A bunch of no good white trash.
[20:54.66]They somehow got rich about 50 years ago.
[20:57.44]They moved here, caused a whole heap of trouble.
[20:59.80]Looking like they was Yankee spies during the war and everything.
[21:03.89]I saw.
[21:05.39]Yeah, sure.
[21:07.65]Tom fell off his ladder yesterday.
[21:09.77]I think he would have died if it weren't for that bale of hay.
[21:12.65]Well, I'll be.
[21:14.27]Why does anyone want to rob this guy?
[21:20.50]I'm sure you've got things to do.
[21:21.76]Don't let me confuse you.
[21:27.65]Oh, I forgot I have a bear hat on.
[21:34.02]No, I'm not... I'm... No.
[21:40.60]No, I came here for a specific reason.
[21:42.00]I was going to talk to Dutch.
[21:45.30]I'm not getting involved.
[21:46.74]I'm not.
[21:49.60]No.
[21:50.52]Dutch, we're going to do the mission.
[21:52.16]I'm going to go talk to Dutch.
[21:54.94]No one's going to get hurt.
[21:56.26]Nothing bad's going to happen.
[21:58.60]I will not do something bad, and I'm not going to fall off the horse.
[22:02.20]Oh, and here is my dear friend, Arthur Callahan.
[22:06.73]Boy is a hunter.
[22:08.37]Boy is a killer.
[22:10.99]Arthur, you've met but not been introduced to Mr. Oh...
[22:15.23]I'm so sorry.

[22:25.08]Life can be tough.
[22:26.80]So it can.
[22:27.60]And no man owes another anything.
[22:31.02]No, sir.
[22:31.97]But still, I feel you were hard done by losing your employment like that.
[22:39.29]But still, here in Rhodes, we have work enough for honest men.
[22:45.68]That's some strong stuff.
[22:47.70]Still, don't seem to be doing you any harm, I guess.
[22:51.61]The funny hat.

[23:40.13]Not a problem at all.
[23:42.33]You are in safe hands now.
[23:45.59]And people waste time with the temperance movement.

[24:17.29]I think he's learned his lesson.
[24:19.33]They're behind us.
[24:20.11]Congratulations on becoming a temporarily deputized citizen of Scarlet Meadows County.
[24:25.91]Most towns just get bounty hunters to do their dirty work these days.
[24:29.71]Oh, my horse.
[24:30.99]The horse is coming.
[24:33.13]Now, I'm sure I don't need to remind you.
[24:35.48]There's a general in command here.
[24:38.00]There is?
[24:39.08]Dang straight there is.
[24:40.34]This is a dangerous business, but follow my lead and you'll be just fine.
[24:45.30]Sure.
[24:46.67]Hey, aren't you all supposed to remind us he's in charge here?
[24:52.21]Of course.
[24:53.15]Sorry, guys.
[24:53.67]Sorry the microphone is inside of the fan.
[24:55.05]You were a big help with them Anderson boys, and I put in a very good word with the sheriff on your behalf.
[25:01.58]We appreciate that.
[25:03.30]We rounded up the others soon after.
[25:05.62]I'm pushing for the rope myself.
[25:07.30]What are they gonna come up with, a device that just nitrogen cools and it's quiet?
[25:12.47]Not just any moonshiners.
[25:13.63]We haven't come up with anything since the 1800s?
[25:15.81]I told you about the Braithwaite.
[25:17.63]A thing that spins really fast?
[25:20.12]No one's come up with like a fucking liquid chemical that they can put in there?
[25:22.92]...at one point until, well, a few changes in the labor laws.
[25:28.41]A refrigerator.
[25:28.89]Yeah, so put like a small fridge unit in the back.
[25:30.89]But that makes noise too.
[25:31.85]I don't want to hear that.
[25:32.53]Put an air conditioner inside of here.
[25:33.77]Add an extra $40 to the majestic retail price.
[25:35.93]You know what I mean?
[25:58.79]You know.
[25:59.43]At 40 bucks.
[26:00.23]Just add soundproof to your refrigerator.
[26:21.80]I have an idea.
[26:23.14]If there's sound coming out of the machine, just block the area where the sound is coming out of and you won't hear it.
[26:30.46]So I'm just going to take rubber cement and put it all over the back of the vent here and I won't hear it anymore.
[26:36.32]Right?
[26:36.50]Like Thinking Face.
[26:37.22]You know what I'm saying?
[26:51.87]What happened here?
[26:56.72]Can I not loot over here?
[26:58.78]Will I be deemed a bad guy?
[27:03.28]I can't loot.
[27:04.17]We're pretending to be sheriffs right now.
[27:10.45]I can't even do it anyways.
[27:11.19]Hmm.
[27:18.56]Hey, come have a look at this.
[27:22.05]Look, suit and tie.
[27:24.63]One bullet cleaned through the forehead.
[27:27.67]My money says this is the handiwork of a gang called the Lemoyne Raiders.
[27:33.94]Yeah, I've run into them.
[27:36.96]Let's see if we've got any identification.
[27:39.10]Okay.
[27:39.24]We should get going.
[27:45.94]I'll send someone over here later to clean this up.
[27:53.45]Is this a main story mission, or was Micah the story mission that I just haven't done?
[27:57.77]Because somebody was like, are you going to do a story mission?
[27:59.41]I'm like, yeah!
[28:01.32]This is one of them, right?
[28:08.42]Get in there.
[28:09.76]Do an impression.
[28:10.96]Alright.
[28:13.27]I want to have a look at these papers.
[28:15.25]I'll direct you.
[28:15.61]I'll direct you.
[28:20.97]That was not bad.
[28:22.31]I give myself an A. No, you can never give yourself an A. That's not how it works.
[28:27.00]I don't have anything funny to say.
[28:29.50]About like a comedy computer.
[28:47.84]I'm not like a Mad Libs book.
[28:49.18]Say something funny.
[28:49.86]How do you even respond to that?
[28:50.64]Okay, well.
[28:50.86]Hear that funny noise?
[28:51.86]Don't go fast.
[28:53.12]What?
[29:17.55]He's like laughing at you guys.
[29:21.01]Give me a break.
[29:22.33]More of that.
[29:23.82]More of that.
[29:24.52]No.
[29:25.30]How about way less of that?
[29:26.66]Just the spam of like LULs and shit.
[29:31.38]Oh my god.
[29:50.96]Just wait till I get up my long rifle.
[29:56.52]I mean, are you talking liberal or metaphorical?
[29:58.94]I don't know.
[29:59.32]Me.
[29:59.64]Me bear.
[30:22.12]Let's split up.
[30:22.88]Rift throat up.
[30:23.74]Me and Archibald.
[30:26.08]You boys want right or left?
[30:27.86]Each throat.
[30:28.42]Oh, I have to... I'd say let's go right.
[30:41.75]We'll take the right.
[30:42.79]I think that's probably a better idea.
[30:43.87]Let's stop these filthy degenerate tax dodgers.
[30:47.59]The cheek of them.
[30:48.71]A fine idea.
[30:49.55]Hush.
[30:49.69]What?
[30:53.13]How do I knock somebody out?
[31:01.60]Yeah.
[31:02.10]What was that?
[31:10.26]I was gonna say something, but I was concentrating on the radar.
[31:15.26]And why am I standing?
[31:16.14]I just said, yeah.
[31:23.71]I'm so focused on the Metal Gear Solid aspect of this mission.
[31:26.21]Alright, I don't think I've ever, like, knocked somebody up from behind before.
[31:40.06]I've only stabbed with knife.
[31:44.12]You know what I mean?
[31:49.45]How do I not kill in this game?
[31:53.36]How do you not kill?
[31:59.08]That killed him.
[32:00.06]That person's gonna die.
[32:01.34]He's dead.
[32:04.54]Take cover?
[32:06.36]Oh, fuck.
[32:06.84]Hot, what, hot?
[32:07.52]It's alright, I got Luigi.
[32:25.15]How would I be able to take cover?
[32:26.29]My head, I have two heads!
[32:31.82]You know what I'm saying?
[32:32.46]Like, my head is big even when I crouch.
[32:40.60]My character's too big.
[32:49.39]He saw a bear and ran away.
[32:51.46]That's, I mean, I was trying to use the tree.
[33:14.83]That was funny.
[33:16.19]Guns up.
[33:16.89]Oh my god.
[33:17.41]That was funny.
[33:18.21]Get him.
[33:19.77]Get him.
[33:20.03]Get him out.
[33:20.77]Nope.
[33:21.01]Get him out.
[33:22.46]It's hard to do it.
[33:23.38]Get him out.
[33:24.32]There it is.
[33:25.42]I got him.
[33:39.25]Dynamite, throw!
[33:39.81]Can I get from back here?
[33:41.15]They just want me to blow that up, right?
[33:45.95]I can't throw it.
[33:47.01]I need to go actually up and press the button.
[33:49.95]Plant dynamite in the distillery.
[33:51.97]Do I have to plant it, or can I just throw it?
[34:09.67]Press R2 to place dynamite without igniting it.
[34:13.52]And then ignite, and then run away.
[34:16.82]And more than one, I guess.
[34:17.80]You want me to put it all over the place.
[34:19.02]Stand clear.
[34:19.72]No, I have to ignite it first.
[34:45.22]I thought I was fucking dead.
[34:46.40]I thought I was gonna hit my head.
[34:49.48]Smack my head into the wall and fall backwards.
[34:53.05]That's a huge bee.
[34:53.85]That's the biggest bee I think I've ever seen.
[34:59.31]Find Bill.
[35:01.77]What is going on with Bill?
[35:02.65]Alright, we're gonna dual wield.
[35:17.23]What is he doing over here?
[35:20.87]What is wrong with you?
[35:43.93]Look, I feel like I'm somebody's little brother playing with toys.
[35:46.50]My hat!
[35:51.18]My hat, you docked up my- Give me my hat.
[35:57.49]Nothing else matters.
[36:04.79]What?
[36:05.19]Oh.
[36:05.37]Is this Bill?
[36:49.17]Oh my god, he was doing the same thing I was doing!
[37:13.11]I can't get in this?
[37:15.43]That's bullshit.
[37:20.60]Fuck.
[37:43.72]Come here!
[37:44.60]Come here, I gotta end this with the tomahawk, otherwise all my friends in my party chat won't like me.
[37:53.38]Oh my fucking god.
[38:02.85]Center mask.
[38:04.73]There's another one?
[38:14.70]No, I wanted to go into his head.
[38:16.12]That guy was really scared of a bear with a tomahawk.
[38:31.97]I mean, you gotta give that guy a little credit, man.
[38:35.55]How would you react to that?
[38:48.64]You can do Deadeye homing Tomahawks.
[38:51.98]I keep forgetting that Deadeye works with other stuff that's not a gun.
[38:56.86]Deadeye is just Deadeye.
[38:58.42]It just means, hey, slow down time and get to hit exactly where you want.
[39:05.96]Where are my other Tomahawks?
[39:07.48]I threw them over here.
[39:09.28]I need to collect the Tomahawks.
[39:11.00]Because they're expensive.
[39:11.90]There's one right here.
[39:14.08]And there's one over here.
[39:20.37]Where is it?
[39:21.09]Up there?
[39:21.43]No, I don't have it.
[39:30.08]Oh well, at least I got one of them.
[39:34.24]Alright, let's go.
[39:35.44]I don't need the money.
[39:36.12]I got... I got two of them back, that's fine.
[39:46.99]Okay.
[39:47.93]Back to Dutch and gang.
[39:49.53]And friends.
[39:52.32]Back to Dutch and gang and friends.
[39:59.64]Oh.
[39:59.80]It's alright.
[40:04.75]Would I ever want to be a modern cowboy in real life?
[40:06.77]A modern cowboy.
[40:15.31]What would that even be?
[40:16.81]Well done.
[40:18.52]Well done.
[40:21.29]Touching gang and friends would be a great alternative title.
[40:23.63]Save that one for next time.
[40:24.49]Where's the desk trombone?
[40:25.65]I still have it.
[40:28.36]It's on my back.
[40:28.74]On the horse.
[40:29.00]I really am a little brother.
[40:29.88]Those are Nerf bullets.
[40:31.00]That's the exact color scheme.
[40:32.96]Those are Nerf bullets.
[40:52.27]Finally.
[40:52.63]Finally.
[41:14.10]I feel like I can't get rid of the beard now, though.
[41:17.80]Know what I mean?
[41:19.90]The beard is important now.
[41:21.98]What if I shave it off?
[41:23.90]I need to be constantly eating.
[41:43.98]I have to become a bear.
[41:44.86]Consistent snacking.
[41:45.88]I can't.
[41:46.38]What's the fattiest thing in the game?
[41:47.52]Probably like meat, right?
[41:49.52]Premium cigarettes.
[42:13.79]Cigar, baked beans.
[42:14.89]Eat the bear meat.
[42:16.35]I'm trying to eat too fast.
[42:18.27]Eat the animal fat.
[42:18.85]I don't think I even can.
[42:36.04]Just a great bunch of booze.
[42:37.04]What?
[42:37.14]Hey, hold on.
[42:37.56]Let's do it.
[43:03.05]My horse is way better than his.
[43:10.99]Here's a race.
[43:14.07]Well, you just got destroyed.
[43:15.49]That was embarrassing.
[43:17.17]Okay, Toad.
[43:19.58]You're gonna get fucking lapped.
[43:44.36]Yeah, dude, this is like poof-a-trouble level of embarrassing here.
[43:48.03]What did I miss?
[43:49.85]I missed a turn!
[44:14.39]My horse is here.
[44:23.20]Let's go!
[44:25.68]Come on!
[44:26.18]Ah, fuck you, man.
[44:51.92]I'll tell you later, I used drugs.
[44:55.93]Doping during the race.
[44:57.55]You've never seen it before, have you?
[45:00.17]I almost just got turtled in the hair right there, but we pulled it back.
[45:04.43]I almost did it again.
[45:09.99]Don't be the dope.
[45:11.05]You don't want to be the hair in this scenario.
[45:30.37]I can't.
[45:31.19]It's over.
[45:32.29]Just trying to cause a distraction like the bad guy in a fucking race cartoon.
[45:38.18]I'm going to put down spikes on the ground.
[45:41.48]I'll throw some jumping jacks down and I will screw up his entire race.
[45:46.38]When you get to be my age, you'll know that better than anything.
[45:50.49]Be well.
[45:51.73]Watch out for this butter.
[45:53.55]It's dastardly.
[45:54.51]I was going to say you're like a son to me.
[45:56.97]And I have to have a dog.
[45:58.84]I always have to have a small dog that laughs at my jokes.
[46:14.20]Enjoy this one.
[46:16.80]Racer boy.
[46:18.48]Release the butter, Springfield.
[46:20.94]And he goes like... Drops the fucking butter on the ground.
[46:38.46]Uh, got dice over here.
[46:40.12]Eat some food and sleep.
[46:50.30]I need to just always constantly be eating.
[46:54.18]Just drink like... I haven't been eating any of my shit.
[46:56.72]I just destroyed one of my cores.
[46:58.25]Uh, alright, so that was a mission.
[47:03.49]That was fun.
[47:09.29]Can you do some more loan?
[47:10.79]Yeah, let's do some more loan missions.
[47:13.17]These are fun.
[47:14.21]Money, lending, and other sins.
[47:16.43]Well, it turns out the pursuit of freedom is not a cheap business.
[47:20.49]Not for us, and not for some of the locals.
[47:24.77]I prefer to call it banking.
[47:26.51]You ain't the one handing out the beatings.
[47:28.47]No, but I am the one feeding the women and children in the camp.
[47:32.08]What choice do we have, Mr. Morgan?
[47:34.08]I don't know.
[47:35.16]Come on, then.
[47:35.94]Tell me who.
[47:36.70]Here's the list.
[47:37.72]Refinery worker turned hunter by the name of Vinton Holmes.
[47:42.22]You'll find him up in the hills north of Strawberry.
[47:44.98]Ah, an apprentice undertaker.
[47:47.29]This one working in Rose.
[47:49.25]His name was Gwen Hughes.
[47:51.93]And how many of them do you think will be able to pay?
[47:54.75]With enough encouragement, both of them.
[48:02.55]Sounds like a plant.
[48:09.13]So, we got some new debts to collect.
[48:16.11]That is right here.
[48:18.33]We also got plays.
[48:20.65]We can go to that one right now.
[48:23.58]This one up here.
[48:27.04]Let's do the one that's right here.
[48:28.44]It's right down the street.
[48:32.74]Shave and change hat.
[48:35.63]I just got this hat.
[48:39.43]Can you pee in this game?
[48:42.23]I don't think so.
[48:44.41]I don't think you can pee.
[48:49.18]Can you pee?
[48:51.64]Candy?
[48:52.60]Wait, I get candy delivered to my door now?
[48:56.55]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[48:59.17]Alright, let's go to Shave.
[49:02.09]Let's take a look at what we can do.
[49:03.19]I don't like that.
[49:19.99]No, it's only at length 4 of 10.
[49:23.13]I'm not doing anything.
[49:30.43]I haven't changed my outfit, though.
[49:33.66]Don't you guys want to see what it looks like when it gets to 10 out of 10?
[49:39.28]Don't you want to see how much of an unruly bastard I look like?
[49:43.22]Oh, clothes.
[49:43.66]I'm gonna Rapunzel this shit, you understand, right?
[49:46.96]And then we're gonna do a big makeover.
[49:56.38]We're gonna go on, like, Monty and, like, have, like, a before and after makeover.
[50:00.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[50:02.70]Custom outfits, sir.
[50:04.22]You are too harsh a critic.
[50:27.14]No coat.
[50:28.62]Alright, I'm gonna start to look like fucking Freddy Fazbear here in a minute.
[50:39.01]No vest.
[50:56.50]Alright, we're gonna go French dress shirt.
[51:02.79]I can't get rid of my pants, though.
[51:07.37]Those pants are too important to me.
[51:19.90]No, I can't.
[51:31.14]Ranch pants.
[51:41.58]Chaps off.
[51:43.40]I can't.
[51:44.38]I want to be decked out right now.
[51:47.88]Those of you that play RPGs or played Warcraft or Diablo, it doesn't matter.
[51:54.50]Right now I have two legendaries on.
[51:57.98]And I have a shitty common shirt on.
[52:02.44]Blue boots.
[52:03.36]No, I want to be decked out in all orange, like, legendary clothes.
[52:07.04]I can modify them, though.
[52:16.45]Closed.
[52:18.89]Rolled sleeves.
[52:19.77]That looks good.
[52:22.57]Can I modify... I can modify it all.
[52:28.51]Oh, no, I can't.
[52:33.31]Could you just get the chaps to match the head?
[52:36.11]I don't think I can.
[52:36.95]Because... No.
[52:51.64]Keep pressing down.
[52:54.10]Then you called me a dummy.
[52:55.20]That wasn't very nice.
[52:56.26]Oh.
[53:00.40]I mean, look, there's plenty of room there to add more spots.
[53:03.29]You know what I mean?
[53:03.83]Like, what?
[53:04.91]There's so much more room.
[53:07.85]Bare feet?
[53:09.07]No.
[53:14.81]I like these.
[53:18.10]Spurs.
[53:23.06]Snakes.
[53:25.82]I mean, I'll take the Slytherin ones.
[53:28.04]Fine.
[53:30.98]masks.
[53:32.90]Can I have this on with the bear hood?
[53:35.48]This would make sense.
[53:36.36]This would be great.
[53:37.24]Can I do this?
[53:39.90]Because... Oh, goddammit.
[53:43.14]I thought I could just have the bear head be my actual head.
[53:52.89]Because that covers up my whole face.
[53:56.37]Oh well.
[53:59.13]I don't think I... I probably can't wear these either.
[54:00.73]No.
[54:07.47]Gloves.
[54:10.19]No, no gloves.
[54:11.25]Bare hands.
[54:15.79]Primary hallway.
[54:16.55]This is where you can change your holsters.
[54:22.75]Uh, I need to put my hat back on, though.
[54:36.45]Bear hands and bear feet.
[54:40.55]Okay.
[54:43.32]Bear hands, bear hat, and bear feet.
[54:50.40]I'm gonna end up with, like... Ugh.
[55:06.41]Alright.
[55:07.63]Well, there it is.
[55:08.33]The bear outfit so far.
[55:09.73]Alright, so what do I want to do?
[55:13.05]I need to put shoes on.
[55:13.85]I need to put on shoes or my character's going to die.
[55:20.54]I'm going to step in some kind of animal shit with a cut on my foot.
[55:23.70]And get the plague.
[55:37.71]Okay.
[55:41.09]So he wants something.
[55:44.61]And you want something, too.
[55:45.76]Everybody wants something.
[55:49.94]Alright, so let's go.
[55:51.22]What was that?
[55:51.60]I was gonna go collect the debt, right?
[55:52.92]I mean, there's a mission right here.
[55:54.50]There's somebody in the camp.
[56:02.51]Uh...
[56:13.33]I hope you step on a Lego.
[56:16.41]Well, that's a chicken.
[56:18.93]Let's do it.
[56:19.59]It's right here.
[56:20.43]Hey, Molly.
[56:22.73]What do you need?
[56:27.05]Put on all subtitles?
[56:28.49]I will after this cutscene.
[56:30.27]I really love him, you know.
[56:32.43]But if he...
[56:40.22]Step on the world's first Lego.
[56:42.86]This is on fire.
[56:43.62]No, it's not.
[57:08.70]Come on over here.
[57:09.42]Will you be my other fool?
[57:11.97]You too, Charles.
[57:13.09]What are you talking about?
[57:15.25]There's above a little stick-up I heard about.
[57:17.37]No, I'm not.
[57:17.95]You just said.
[57:18.87]I'll do it.
[57:19.77]As long as you ride with us.
[57:21.60]I got a serious medical condition.
[57:24.02]I could not take this guy seriously.
[57:44.20]We're reaching Dead Rising levels of you don't belong here.
[57:47.24]Not crazy yet.
[58:15.05]Not crazy enough yet.
[58:15.83]Well, I'm not sure what else we could do.
[58:18.02]I guess I could get, like, the legendary turkey.
[58:21.26]And get, like, the turkey feathers on my back, right?
[58:24.28]I mean, that... We just have to be the fucking legendary animal guy.
[58:35.09]I have to kill the legendary turkey, right?
[58:39.03]That needs to happen.
[58:39.87]I can't rest until the legendary turkey is dead.
[58:42.77]And they're going to put wings on him and try to fly.
[58:45.72]Legendary rat.
[58:46.16]Okay, like rat shoes.
[58:58.85]Turkey wingsuit.
[59:12.15]Now I do just look like I'm a bear.
[59:13.27]It's just like Dungeons & Dragons campaign.
[59:42.70]Not even a Wild West anymore.
[59:44.36]Stop the wagon!
[59:47.34]I said, stop the damn wagon!
[59:51.54]Hands up.
[59:52.72]We're gonna rock you.
[59:53.54]Don't try anything stupid, and we won't do it.
[59:57.92]Okay.
[59:59.14]That's right.
[59:59.52]You know, boys, I don't want to get shot, but this is a mistake.
[60:04.73]I work for Cornwall Kerosene and Tar.
[60:07.33]Mr. Leviticus Cornwall.
[60:09.75]Oh, great.
[60:10.95]So, you know...
[60:13.27]Did I just respond?
[60:15.11]I hear he's rich enough to share the wealth around and not miss it too much.
[60:20.36]Oh, he'll miss it.
[60:21.92]Okay.
[60:22.54]I'm not going for lethal anymore.
[60:26.24]Not lethal.
[60:26.70]We're just going for the kidney.
[60:29.94]Oh, I gotta help.
[60:30.72]What?
[60:31.68]What was that?
[60:37.24]There's two boxes at the back, Arthur.
[60:40.67]Clean your guns?
[60:41.55]I will.
[60:42.95]Just give me a moment.
[60:43.95]Oh, we got $150.
[60:44.35]That's a lot of money.
[60:45.35]Uh-oh.
[60:46.81]We're being chased.
[61:07.72]Why are we using our real names?
[61:09.18]Why can't we use our horses' names?
[61:13.72]Hold R3 to look behind you in the pursuers.
[61:18.70]Oh, no.
[61:20.20]Don't make me look behind me.
[61:22.40]Oh, goddammit.
[61:22.96]Not one of these.
[61:23.58]Pick them all up.
[61:45.91]Are we supposed to turn?
[61:49.11]I don't want to run into anything
[62:18.30]I can't throw the dynamite.
[62:23.69]It doesn't work.
[62:24.33]The homing dynamite didn't... I couldn't do it.
[62:26.39]Is this lit?
[62:27.33]This one's lit!
[62:27.87]This one's lit!
[62:28.31]This one's lit!
[62:28.73]This one's lit!
[62:33.37]Where are my friends?
[62:52.87]This is so lit.
[62:54.05]Alright, I'm just gonna... This whole R3 thing.
[62:57.27]I got no Deadeyes.
[62:58.91]Let's drink a snake oil.
[63:18.42]It takes forever for dynamite to blow up in your hand, but it's funny when you freak out about it, so whatever.
[63:24.18]Does it take... It takes a long time?
[63:25.86]Alright.
[63:27.70]Let's get out of sight.
[63:48.78]Stay until dark, and then we'll sneak out of here.
[63:52.86]Charles, you keep watch for now.
[63:54.58]Sure.
[63:55.70]Well, we, uh, get some rest.
[63:59.69]Who's gonna sleep in here?
[64:03.49]We all just woke up two hours ago.
[64:12.14]Alright.
[64:14.13]Let's try and get out of here.
[64:15.53]Hey, shit.
[64:16.55]Absolutely.
[64:17.99]Shut up, old man.
[64:19.03]Look, I was just trying to... Shut up.
[64:21.81]There's a light over by the house.
[64:23.69]Damn.
[64:23.83]This guy's copying my outfit.
[64:25.35]He's got bare feet, too.
[64:26.59]Let's just keep this calm.
[64:30.14]See what happens.
[64:38.52]Uh oh.
[64:38.90]We're in deep trouble.
[64:41.66]They're gonna search.
[64:42.92]They're gonna come in here.
[65:06.33]Go check out the bar.
[65:09.40]Slow motion, like, go check out the bar.
[65:14.04]And all of us are like, oh, fuck.
[65:34.82]Well, the place looks deserted enough.
[65:37.77]Sure.
[65:39.49]You head inside.
[65:40.43]I'll go around the back.
[65:47.27]We're all just sitting in here.
[65:59.56]Looks like we're shooting our way out of here, fellas.
[66:06.44]Do it.
[66:11.43]My guy's like just role-playing.
[66:17.45]He's like, guys, I can't shoot.
[66:18.56]My character only has Tomahawks.
[66:30.67]Okay, let the DM just know that I really didn't want to pull the gun out, but like... Some people aren't playing well here with us.
[66:41.48]I don't want this person invited back.
[66:43.14]I'm not supposed to be playing like this.
[66:48.73]What do I have for profi- like, wanted proficiency with a sidearm?
[66:54.19]But I'm being pressured to take the gun out.
[66:56.19]Where'd you find this guy?
[66:58.23]I'm fucking prejudiced.
[67:07.22]Dead.
[67:07.50]Oh shit, I was too busy.
[67:08.81]I'm just standing there.
[67:13.75]I told you, I'm not proficient with that.
[67:19.15]Craigslist Dungeons & Dragons players.
[67:23.24]Oh, why can't I move?
[67:24.80]Alright, let's do this for real.
[67:26.52]I'll put this away.
[67:35.82]That's not gonna happen.
[67:37.30]Oh lord.

[69:57.32]We need to get out of here.
[69:58.16]How do I get out of here?
[70:00.58]What do I do?
[70:08.15]I'm panicking.
[70:10.59]I can't see.
[70:11.21]How do I get out of here?
[70:21.12]How do I get out?
[70:22.88]How do I get out?

[72:32.44]Uh-oh.
[72:33.48]Clearly those boys ain't as quiet as us.
[72:35.44]Yes, we should go.

[73:44.38]Oh.
[73:54.60]That's it, right?
[74:20.23]Cinematic.
[74:20.59]I didn't do that.
[74:21.79]He did.
[74:22.13]Don't you guys understand that?
[74:23.16]You see the black bars?
[74:53.96]I gotta search the satchel, right?
[75:00.14]The hat's in flames, man.
[75:01.25]We have to generate a new one.

[78:39.88]Now!
[78:40.00]This has to stop now!

[78:57.10]It ends here.
[78:57.82]Okay, we're fine.
[79:00.24]We're out of the way.
[79:34.80]Okay.
[79:36.35]In the clear, not quite.
[79:37.87]This guy's still coming this way.
[79:42.13]The biggest bounty I've had was 1500 bucks.
[79:44.57]Oh god.
[79:49.88]Okay.
[79:52.32]Why did that even happen?
[79:54.38]I don't remember.
[79:54.95]I just saw red.
[80:09.76]Where's my hat?
[80:13.09]No, that's the wrong one.
[80:17.06]There it is.
[80:26.98]Sorry I had to unsub.
[80:27.88]Just found out my PayPal's broke.
[80:29.68]Don't ever apologize for not being able to give me one.
[80:33.26]But thank you.
[80:34.74]Thank you for subbing for as long as you did.
[80:36.88]Thank you so much.
[80:37.44]Alright, I need to win.
[80:40.98]The horse needs to eat.
[80:42.06]I need to eat.
[80:50.50]Don't tell me what to do.
[80:56.72]Okay, we got... I need some lightning bolt and a dead eye.
[81:05.95]Well, there it is.
[81:06.65]Some more health.
[81:11.02]Sweet corn.
[81:13.24]Alright.
[81:17.74]Where am I going now?
[81:19.41]Oh, right, to the debt.
[81:20.67]There's a stranger here, and then we got a bounty, didn't we?
[81:24.15]Speaking of bounties to collect, there's one to collect on me.
[81:31.02]I probably should take care of that.
[81:32.10]There, over at the post office.
[81:39.99]I need to apologize.
[81:41.27]I need to go in and say sorry with money.
[81:51.53]You don't think that the sheriffs would have some kind of inkling of suspicion when one of their deputies comes in?
[81:58.31]What are you doing in here, uh, Deputy Arthur?
[81:59.94]Oh, you know, just... paying off some of my bounties.
[82:03.88]Oh!
[82:05.28]You already did.
[82:23.05]Well, what did you do?
[82:23.99]Well, I saw the man in his head.
[82:28.77]He was looking at me funny.
[82:35.25]And he said the same dialog sequence a bunch of times.
[82:43.86]What you want?
[82:45.84]You OK?
[82:48.70]I shot a man in his head.
[82:51.60]No.
[82:52.78]You look awful.
[82:55.00]Awful.
[82:56.54]Look at me.
[82:58.00]Useless.
[82:59.66]I wasn't born to this.
[83:00.96]I didn't deserve this.
[83:02.77]I used to be gentle.
[83:05.53]Jeremiah Compson.
[83:07.37]Compsonstead.
[83:08.59]Good for you, if that's anything to boast about.
[83:11.47]He took everything from me.
[83:13.45]Who did?
[83:13.89]They.
[83:15.21]And what did they take?
[83:17.19]My whole life.
[83:19.01]A whole way of living a career.
[83:22.15]I stole a lot of things, but that's quite a lot to steal.
[83:25.41]Look at me here, living in the shit and the mud.
[83:29.36]I'm sorry.
[83:31.76]Oops.
[83:38.35]My old house.
[83:40.51]That was my grandfather built.
[83:42.39]That was some Exorcist level of insta-puke, by the way.
[83:46.57]Repossessed by the bank.
[83:48.36]I was possessed.
[83:50.14]I was supposed to live a different life.
[83:54.14]Me too.
[83:55.60]If only I could get my old things back.
[83:59.62]Personal mementos.
[84:01.63]A watch.
[84:03.53]An old pistol.
[84:06.03]My ledger.
[84:07.25]Where's this house again?
[84:08.81]Compson's stead.
[84:10.01]It's a
[84:11.23]North of Scarlet Meadows.
[84:14.67]Thanks as I can't go near.
[84:15.98]Jeremiah Ancestor.
[84:17.16]I'm living rough over by Arras Field.
[84:19.66]Well, if I'm ever out that way, I'll see what I can do.
[84:23.62]Time.
[84:24.72]Time is hell.
[84:28.18]Hmm.
[84:29.87]Okay.
[84:30.47]Well, I just got it, so let's go get it.
[84:37.87]It's over there.
[84:42.78]And over there is... over here.
[84:45.92]He took your gun.
[84:54.59]I hate time.
[84:57.33]It's hell.
[84:59.47]Time is hell.
[85:00.39]I hate... Here, have some peppermints.
[85:10.17]I can't even take... I can't even cycle through my weapons, huh?
[85:25.54]Now what else we got?
[85:27.18]We can drink the opened gin, if I have it.
[85:36.06]How are we doing on healing?
[85:37.88]We're okay.
[85:39.04]You want a peppermint?
[85:46.03]So we're going to collect this guy's stuff.
[85:50.31]That sounds like a true adventure, one that I would love to take part in.
[85:53.61]It's high noon for gamers.
[86:00.64]Oop.
[86:05.70]What's going on over here?
[86:07.98]There we go.
[86:09.40]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[86:09.97]This is a hunting party, or is this bandits?
[86:14.67]Uh-oh.
[86:15.51]Me.
[86:15.59]Uh-oh.
[86:44.08]I'm sorry, you were saying something?
[86:52.02]I didn't hear what you were saying.
[86:54.10]I mean, it was hard to hear it over the screams, so... Oh boy.
[87:26.90]What did I come back to?
[87:28.42]Why did I run over?
[87:32.00]Something wrong?
[87:34.96]What's wrong with me?
[87:43.55]Why did I just get, like, a sepia tongue?
[88:07.46]Jeremy, you're taking this role-playing thing too seriously.
[88:30.91]You will address me by my name, Richard Arthur.
[88:34.67]Arthur Morgan.
[88:37.91]Pleased to meet you, Your Queen.
[88:46.64]I'll order a Judge Meredith Holden in the courts of the state of Le Moyne.
[88:50.46]We do hereby grant repossession of this property and all items here into the Bank of Rhodes.
[88:56.80]M. Holden, Judge Holden.
[88:58.70]Henrietta Blackley, clerk.
[89:00.16]M. Holden, Judge Holden.
[89:01.36]November 18th, 1895.
[89:02.58]You think a notice is going to stop me?
[89:36.27]That's a spell, incantation of the door, guys.
[89:41.93]I can't touch it.
[89:42.63]I can't go near it.
[89:45.90]It's a shielding spell.
[89:46.94]I can't... Ledger.
[89:55.52]Watch.
[89:56.60]Pistol.
[90:00.25]Ledger.
[90:01.13]Watch.
[90:01.93]Pistol.
[90:04.61]Why would I need to look at this?
[90:09.45]Hmm.
[90:10.81]Which angle should I look at?
[90:12.43]I'm gonna step on an exposed nail.
[90:22.30]Ugh.
[90:34.01]Covered.
[90:36.86]Search the cupboard.
[90:40.02]Cupboard.
[90:40.68]Where was it?
[90:41.38]Excuse me.
[90:42.33]No, I don't want to examine the bottle.
[90:43.63]I want to search the cupboard.
[90:49.95]Empty.
[90:56.74]Family... I don't know what that even just said.
[91:05.75]Cool.
[91:36.69]What is it?
[91:37.19]Family didgeridoo.
[91:41.44]Hmm.
[92:15.06]is to inform you that your monthly cable bill was not paid.
[92:19.62]Dear Mr. Compson, I'm afraid there's no more work for you down here at the plantation.
[92:25.43]I'm grateful for the help you've given us and to help your pappy and your pappy's pappy gave us before you.
[92:32.35]These are trying times for all of us.
[92:34.57]You are in our thoughts and prayers.
[92:37.06]Yours truly, Colonel J. Nixon, the Ascension Plantation.
[92:49.52]Oh, here's a pocket watch.
[92:50.36]Does it still work?
[92:57.48]Wow, after all these years.
[93:01.02]And it's even the correct time.
[93:05.57]What time is it?
[93:07.97]Show me the time.
[93:08.79]That's the correct time.
[93:17.29]Need the pistol and the ledger.
[93:20.62]Pistol and the ledger.
[93:27.80]Oh, cigarettes.
[93:55.55]Okay.
[93:57.01]Premium cigarettes.
[93:58.95]What Pokémon card did I get?
[94:01.95]Gems of Beauty card four.
[94:11.68]Alright.
[94:18.02]Time to go upstairs, probably.
[94:19.42]Okay.
[94:20.36]Where is all this old crap?
[94:25.52]Old crap.
[94:27.77]Well, let's go through your entryway desk and see what you got in there.
[94:32.73]Don't be so quick to judge, Arthur.
[94:34.67]I know how many manuals for vacuum cleaners, instructional booklets for monitors, and warranty cards you have in there, dude.
[94:46.20]Give me a break.
[94:46.64]Alright, I can open this, can't I?
[94:54.65]Like, this looks like it can be opened.
[95:06.60]Shoot.
[95:07.00]Duh.
[95:08.68]Duh.
[95:10.58]I had to see it first.
[95:15.57]I didn't even get the items.
[95:18.53]Easy.
[95:21.97]Just looking around for some things.
[95:25.08]Never bring a guy out.
[95:55.94]Never bring a knife to a gunfight.
[96:21.14]That guy didn't have anything.
[96:22.24]First person in the whole game that didn't have even a descent on them.
[96:26.52]Wow.
[96:33.91]Never bring them.
[96:35.61]Wooden rubber band pistol.
[96:37.65]Gunfight.
[96:40.19]The ledger's probably... It's probably, like, in here.
[96:44.33]Ow.
[96:50.04]AAA game.
[96:51.60]AAA game.
[96:52.80]Bugs.
[96:53.30]Look at the bug.
[97:08.15]Dear diary.
[97:13.61]This is like going through somebody's mail, man.
[97:15.17]You're not supposed to do this.
[97:20.15]Well, that's that.
[97:21.50]I was somewhere near Rhodes when they caught me.
[97:24.28]Till the day I die, I ain't gonna forget the sound of that dog barking in my heels.
[97:29.34]But I don't suppose that day gonna be far off yet.
[97:32.76]It was 50 lashings yesterday and 50 more to come.
[97:36.45]I don't think I can take any more.
[97:38.81]Man said he was doing his job.
[97:41.21]Funny kind of employment if you ask me, but I suppose you ain't.
[97:45.39]Light's fading, so that's it for now.
[97:48.19]I do hope I live to see the end of this war and justice win out.
[97:54.16]June 64.
[97:54.88]Holy shit.
[98:05.95]God.
[98:29.66]Anything else?
[98:30.60]No.
[98:32.80]That's fucked up.
[98:33.64]Oh no.
[98:42.57]This your ledger?
[98:44.38]A list of slaves?
[98:47.09]Rewards January 15th Betsy $17 January 18th Louise $12 May 18th Wilfred $18 May 24th Minnie and child $20 Jesus
[99:29.51]Anything else?
[99:42.72]Fuck you.
[99:44.52]Oh, no.
[99:44.98]Ah, shit.
[100:00.28]I'm okay.
[100:03.38]The hat!
[100:12.49]Where is it?
[100:13.67]That's not it.
[100:16.37]Did it fall down?
[100:21.46]Oh, it's the big... It just disappeared!
[100:23.52]It was right here.
[100:25.30]Oh.
[100:30.81]Okay.
[100:34.44]Did I miss anything else?
[100:35.16]I can't go upstairs.
[100:38.42]Alright.
[100:44.47]Can I actually break out this front door?
[100:48.29]No.
[100:48.81]It's boarded.
[101:02.68]Alright, so... Let's see how this plays out.
[101:12.15]I'm a level 80 mage.
[101:13.91]Why?
[101:14.27]Because I have a hat.
[101:29.46]I mean, I can't use weapons in roads, though.
[101:33.27]I could throw dynamite at him, but I can't do that.
[101:35.55]It's not allowed.
[101:36.15]Can I ask him to follow me and then, like, run him over with a car?
[101:45.00]Speaking of a truck car.
[101:46.42]Yeah.
[101:50.07]God about us.
[101:52.35]Just when they needed us, they threw us away like shit on their boot.
[101:59.95]Times wasn't perfect.
[102:01.09]I ain't saying that.
[102:02.15]It's just...
[102:05.22]It's all... It's all gone to hell.
[102:09.02]Old man.
[102:09.92]Old man?
[102:12.90]You show some respect.
[102:16.12]I was respected once.
[102:18.22]I had a profession.
[102:19.74]You asked me to get you something.
[102:21.78]There's no bringing back what I want.
[102:23.46]I I want my job, my pride.
[102:26.44]The respect accorded to a gentleman.
[102:30.07]What about this old crap?
[102:32.63]Huh?
[102:34.82]things.
[102:36.23]Don't you understand?
[102:37.19]Those bastards, they changed everything.
[102:39.25]I was a good worker.
[102:41.31]I took pride in my work.
[102:42.91]They took it away.
[102:44.91]Pissed on my legacy.
[102:46.57]Oh, man.
[102:47.59]Some jobs ain't for saving.. And some legacies, they are for pissing on.
[102:54.23]What are you doing?
[102:55.13]That's my history.
[103:06.28]He tried to shoot me.
[103:06.84]He tried to shoot me.
[103:07.82]He pointed at me.
[103:10.59]I still exist.
[103:14.13]Oh.
[103:15.89]Oh.
[103:16.21]Oh.
[103:16.57]Oh.
[103:16.91]Oh.
[103:17.17]Oh.
[103:17.57]Oh.
[103:57.67]I can't kick him into the fire?
[103:59.53]I can't.
[104:09.94]What?
[104:27.59]Forgive me.
[104:56.85]Oh, no, I just barefooted him.
[104:59.43]I wanted to do the lasso.
[105:02.13]No!
[105:09.50]Lasso!
[105:09.78]Come with me.
[105:10.18]What?
[105:31.19]Get over there!
[105:31.79]Oh, whatever.
[105:37.50]Oh, now he's on fire.
[105:47.07]Oh, shit.
[105:49.55]Hold on.
[105:50.09]I gotta get him over there.
[106:06.56]Into the water.
[106:09.00]Where's the train?
[106:11.42]Almost there.
[106:11.90]No, I'm not shotgunning his head.
[106:33.13]I could have just picked him up.
[106:39.76]Okay, here we are.
[106:47.01]Let's go.
[107:08.26]Let's wait.
[107:08.78]No, I'm not waiting.
[107:14.78]It's just, uh, they'll be turning into fucking dog food real soon here.
[107:23.42]Wait.
[107:23.74]Wait for the train.
[107:37.74]It's gonna take forever.
[107:38.82]Oh, right, right, right.
[107:42.76]My hat, my hat, my hat.
[107:43.74]Thank you.
[108:02.15]I'll be here for an hour.
[108:05.01]Wait off the tracks?
[108:07.13]Oh, right.
[108:10.40]Look, he's already been murdered.
[108:16.76]He's dead.
[108:20.10]It's over, he's dead.
[108:29.79]We want blood.
[108:33.17]We want, what, dynamiting somebody and then burning their body?
[108:37.48]You want more?
[108:39.59]What?
[108:40.51]More?
[108:43.01]What's the matter?
[108:49.50]Snake bite?
[108:52.70]I'll take care of it.
[108:53.40]This guy's going to give me a new gun.
[108:55.20]I need medicine.
[108:56.54]Or you need to suck them in my mouth.
[109:02.21]Maybe I'll get another free gun.
[109:04.27]I have an idea.
[109:12.84]Not a word to anyone.
[109:15.16]Got me?
[109:15.50]I owe you one, mister.
[109:19.12]Hopefully, I could repay you someday.
[109:22.12]Got that right.
[109:23.40]Maybe one day.
[109:24.88]I gotta get out of here.
[109:26.82]Don't...
[109:29.51]I can't wait till he shows up and gives me, like, something for free.
[109:35.17]Have a good day.
[109:40.03]Goodbye.
[109:42.59]Thanks for the free gun in, like, two hours.
[109:48.26]Sucking out venom doesn't work?
[109:49.50]Yeah, I know.
[109:50.08]I said that last stream and everybody yelled at me.
[109:54.09]If you suck venom out of somebody's wound, you're putting it into your mouth.
[109:58.65]The poison then seeps into your bloodstream, and then now it's your problem.
[110:03.68]And it's already in their bloodstream.
[110:05.88]Everybody made fun of me when I brought that up last time.
[110:10.06]It was screaming, it was yelling.
[110:11.64]Should we just go do Micah now?
[110:16.57]It's dark in here.
[110:18.13]I always forget to turn the lights on.
[110:22.61]Let me just take this opportunity to go take a pee.
[110:26.61]Might as well.
[110:27.11]I'll be right back in like two minutes.
[113:23.73]Dude, he's been gone for so long.
[113:24.97]Where the fuck is he?
[113:27.05]Is he still here?
[113:27.83]I don't fucking have any idea.
[113:33.06]Check his Twitter.
[113:33.70]Check it.
[113:33.94]Look at his fucking Twitter.
[113:34.76]See what he's doing.
[113:40.04]Alright.
[113:40.46]We got... Fan.
[113:45.64]So we've got... We did... I don't even remember the last thing we did.
[113:51.79]Okay, graze?
[113:52.51]Let me look at that.
[113:56.91]Dutch asks you to sniff around Caliga Hall to see what you can find about the graze.
[114:05.46]Okay, and then... Micah asks you to meet him at his camp near Strawberry.
[114:19.35]Okay.
[114:21.58]Let's do... I think someone's been on here for so long.
[114:24.98]I think it's time to do Micah.
[114:31.41]Learning how to read.
[114:32.29]I think it's time.
[114:34.57]It's time.
[114:40.65]So I'm going to take...
[114:45.41]Down or up?
[114:46.33]Is there the stagecoach here?
[114:48.77]Looks like... I don't know.
[114:50.17]Probably down's probably quicker.
[114:52.21]And there... Okay, we're gonna go down here.
[114:54.45]Alright, we're gonna go down here, we're gonna do this, and then we're gonna go to GR.
[115:00.65]Okay?
[115:02.01]Forget everything I just said.
[115:08.89]He's been down there for a long time, but you know, sometimes you gotta wait.
[115:11.73]You know what I mean?
[115:17.17]Like when Sakurai delayed Smash Bros.
[115:19.89]Brawl three months back in like 2008.
[115:21.99]It was worth waiting for.
[115:24.70]I think it's time to change out horses too.
[115:33.54]Whisper's getting a little tired.
[115:46.64]Brawl.
[115:48.20]Did they delay Brawl?
[115:49.22]Yeah, like three times.
[115:51.26]They delayed Brawl at least two or three times.
[115:57.52]Uh-oh.
[115:58.06]Outlaws.
[115:59.34]Quick, turn this way.
[116:06.07]I wouldn't say that Brawl was the best Smash game.
[116:08.29]I would say that Brawl was the most anticipated Smash game.
[116:15.13]out of all of them that have been made so far.
[116:16.83]I would say that.
[116:20.29]That guy's just shooting!
[116:29.61]Where'd my horse go?
[116:31.01]Come here.
[116:44.37]You don't get in an accident with somebody and start shooting them.
[116:47.83]I did not deserve that.
[116:48.83]I was ta- I was read- okay, well... I'll be fair, I was reading.
[117:04.22]I was reading chat.
[117:05.64]But that guy was... on the wrong side of the road.
[117:17.33]This place is just beautiful.
[117:19.27]This place is just beautiful.
[117:24.83]Alright, workshop or office.
[117:26.52]I wonder where this person is.
[117:27.66]I'm going to say, hold on, let's replenish everything.
[117:36.73]And then let's do some cores here.
[117:38.35]This one?
[117:42.45]And let's have a drink.
[117:45.69]What do I go for?
[117:46.43]Alcohol.
[117:46.91]Gin.
[117:54.78]That's so rude.
[117:55.96]Okay, let's go in.
[118:00.16]Alright, that door doesn't open.
[118:02.02]What about this one?
[118:02.92]No.
[118:03.74]Eh?
[118:04.98]This...
[118:15.47]What's going on here?
[118:16.31]What is he dressed up as?
[118:17.43]Am I looking in the mirror?
[118:18.81]What?
[118:47.99]I don't understand.
[118:48.91]What the fuck?
[118:49.37]Alright, just hang tight.
[118:50.51]I'll think of something.
[118:51.51]Just stay there.
[119:17.01]How do I use this lock breaking kit?
[119:19.43]Okay.
[119:23.31]I can't use a gun here though.
[119:46.06]How am I supposed to do this?
[119:48.48]Welcome.
[119:49.26]Your first time in my shop?
[119:53.76]Whoa, now.
[119:55.18]That's a fool.
[119:55.94]I want to see what's in that basement of yours.
[119:59.11]Show me.
[120:00.57]Right now.
[120:02.05]Nothing to no worse down there, I swear.
[120:04.41]Why don't I be the judge of that?
[120:06.77]Open the door.
[120:07.99]Alright, alright.
[120:08.97]Ain't got nothing to hide.
[120:14.18]Got my boy sleeping down there.
[120:16.71]Such a shame to wake him.
[120:17.45]You know, you can always come back after he wakes up.
[120:22.83]I want those hands where I can see them.
[120:26.43]You just stay away from me.
[120:28.19]Now what'd I tell you about talking to your pa that way?
[120:30.23]What the fuck?
[120:36.18]Don't shoot me, please.
[120:38.56]Just leave us be.
[120:41.19]You're under arrest for keeping somebody down here against their free will.
[120:47.10]You're... You're... You're the...
[121:20.36]Where are the... where are... Please.
[121:23.04]Please help me.
[121:23.73]He's got me chained up.
[121:25.91]Oh, no!
[121:27.71]Oh, finally.
[121:29.07]Thank you.
[121:30.21]Thank you.
[121:31.55]Oh, you... I'm sorry.
[121:35.92]Please forgive me.
[121:38.28]I know it was wrong.
[121:40.48]I just couldn't face that he was gone.
[121:47.07]I was teaching Sammy how to hold the rifle proper out by the river.
[121:53.71]The recoil shot him backwards.
[122:01.31]He slipped into the river.
[122:04.65]The water pulled him downstream so quick.
[122:08.88]It all happened so fast, I didn't know what to do.
[122:13.54]I searched up and down that riverbank for days.
[122:19.36]But I couldn't find my boy.
[122:21.64]I just miss him so much.
[122:25.16]And you!
[122:27.90]You remind me of him.
[122:30.46]You look just like him.
[122:33.51]I'm so sorry.
[122:35.96]Please forgive me.
[122:37.66]It's too late for apologies.
[122:40.32]You just count yourself lucky that I don't kill you for what you did.
[122:43.38]Don't know what else you want from me.
[122:47.72]Tell it to the judge.
[122:49.04]Take what you want.
[122:50.24]I don't care anymore.
[122:54.51]Tell it to the judge.
[122:59.27]I mean the ultimate judge.
[123:01.97]Satan.
[123:03.61]Wait, did he say he could take his stuff?
[123:25.44]Whoa!
[123:28.18]What is this?
[123:31.38]Lancaster repeater?
[123:34.63]Oh!
[123:35.31]What is this thing?
[123:37.61]Thanks for the free gun.
[124:03.31]Anything else down here?
[124:05.11]Ooh.
[124:14.81]How much money you got in here?
[124:17.09]Two dollars and dollar.
[124:20.01]Your, like, ultimate judgment is getting worse by the second here, man.
[124:28.07]Because, like, that's bullshit.
[124:31.29]You stay right there.
[124:36.26]I'm taking everything in the whole house.
[124:41.81]Oh, I can't... I can't use... Well, I'm only allowed to use the gun down here.
[124:50.07]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:58.33]What happens if I walk up the stairs?
[124:59.75]Oh, no, I can't.
[125:02.69]I'm going to take all the money from the cash register.
[125:08.71]I mean, like, this is easy.
[125:09.67]Free money.
[125:13.15]I'm taking everything in the store.
[125:14.77]I'm taking everything!
[125:20.34]Did you have any money in there?
[125:22.94]I'll take every single thing in the store.
[125:27.59]It's gonna be like... Remember the end of the Scrooge McDuck movie?
[125:30.97]When the guy had the pants filled with the coins?
[125:36.94]Look at all this shit.
[125:37.96]It's all mine.
[125:45.23]I'm taking everything.
[125:52.65]Black Friday.
[126:00.70]This guy's not gonna have any inventory left.
[126:03.70]He's not gonna matter where he's going.
[126:11.89]Everything must go.
[126:13.27]Any weapon on the walls.
[126:14.47]I don't care what it is.
[126:15.29]It's mine.
[126:27.29]I'm never gonna have to purchase bullets ever again.
[126:32.11]They're worth a dollar each?
[126:33.03]Yeah, but when you take 50 of them, that's 50 bucks.
[126:40.18]Okay, what do we got over here?
[126:41.86]I get to take my whole sweet time with this, too.
[126:44.26]This is great.
[126:45.06]Alright, what else is over here?
[126:47.56]Oh, I'll take these, too.
[127:02.84]Is there any other- is there any guns?
[127:13.87]I'm fine.
[127:14.59]I'm barely bad.
[127:17.40]Alright, what about over here?
[127:18.52]Nope.
[127:22.92]This is my only opportunity to rob an entire store, you know what I'm saying?
[127:26.54]Answer the door.
[127:29.16]What?
[127:29.34]There's nobody here.
[127:32.14]What do you mean, answer the door?
[127:33.20]What, you have to pretend to be the shopkeeper?
[127:46.38]Answer the door.
[127:49.43]Yeah, come on in.
[127:50.57]What would you like to buy?
[127:52.39]Well, I would like to have some ammo.
[127:54.93]We ain't got none of that left.
[127:57.17]Oh.
[127:59.31]What about some canned goods?
[128:00.77]Nope.
[128:00.87]Do you have any weapons?
[128:03.21]No, no.
[128:03.72]They're all gone.
[128:07.64]Sorry, we don't have anything left.
[128:09.90]Oh.
[128:10.84]Well, have a good day.
[128:11.62]Have a good day.
[128:18.22]Okay.
[128:18.62]Well, now... The whole place is cleaned out.
[128:21.72]What about inside the cupboards here?
[128:22.84]Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.
[128:29.68]Looks like I... Can I go upstairs?
[128:31.82]No, this is just the downstairs.
[128:33.04]Okay.
[128:34.46]So, we got everything we wanted.
[128:37.48]He's down here.
[128:38.04]Okay.
[128:45.46]The gun?
[128:45.80]I have the gun.
[128:56.15]So, if I... Why can I not take a... Gold gun on table.
[129:07.86]What the hell are you guys talking about?
[129:16.65]Oh.
[129:18.29]Okay, so here's my opportunity.
[129:19.45]I have to... I gotta do this quick.
[129:27.29]I have 400 bullets for this.
[129:28.26]Let me just check out its aim and everything.
[129:36.90]No, what do you mean no?
[129:37.80]No, what do you mean no?
[129:39.12]Don't kill him.
[129:40.08]Why?
[129:43.64]Why?
[129:43.92]You don't want me to kill this guy?
[130:04.28]He's going to jail.
[130:06.80]Gun oil.
[130:07.68]Sun's drawing.
[130:08.02]Oh, Jesus.
[130:14.00]Dog?
[130:15.30]Who's dog?
[130:36.14]Alright, let's go.
[130:39.25]You're under arrest for being the ultimate creep.
[130:43.98]You're coming with me.
[131:06.00]The door's blocking us.
[131:12.72]I can walk out this way, right?
[131:17.59]Okay.
[131:18.57]Where's the jail?
[131:21.39]Is this jail?
[131:24.05]No.
[131:25.81]Where's the sheriff's department?
[131:29.78]Here is the general store.
[131:31.26]Newspaper.
[131:33.44]Saloon.
[131:34.48]Blackjack!
[131:36.29]Blackjack.
[131:36.96]I don't care about anything else.
[131:37.84]Over there.
[131:50.43]Okay.
[131:53.61]Let's check.
[131:54.07]Let's get this guy into the cell.
[132:15.02]Okay.
[132:19.83]He was taken.
[132:20.37]I didn't have to do anything.
[132:26.05]The devil fucking grabbed that guy out of a portal.
[132:32.39]His eternal suffering.
[132:33.55]I could... Look, putting him in a jail cell, I could never even compete with the eternal suffering he's gonna have right now.
[132:40.29]So, whatever.
[132:43.63]Alright, blackjack.
[132:48.06]Right here.
[132:51.01]Let's play it.
[133:00.47]I actually have to win.
[133:01.77]I have to double down and win, like, five hands or something.
[133:04.38]That's a further achievement.
[133:06.88]Okay.
[133:29.85]Two silver earrings.
[133:30.77]Nice.
[133:35.33]Okay.
[133:43.53]That's it.
[133:45.21]There's a nightstand.
[133:48.33]That's it.
[133:52.79]Okay.
[133:54.78]Blackjack time.
[133:59.70]I'm here!
[134:00.42]I'd love to play some Blackjack.
[134:01.50]I got money to spend.
[134:02.22]I got 1200 bucks with Blackjack's name on it.
[134:29.35]Oh, there ain't no cause no more.
[134:31.17]Don't pretend otherwise.
[134:34.85]No doubt.
[134:36.49]Move along.
[134:37.37]We ain't looking for you.
[134:38.59]Hit the trail.
[134:39.93]Come on.
[134:44.29]No, I want to play black.
[134:45.19]I don't want to start a brawl.
[134:46.89]Hey, now.
[134:47.31]You're going to leave here.
[134:48.31]You got me?
[134:48.53]If you don't leave, I'll make you leave.
[134:50.32]That simple?
[134:51.36]Get this water piece.
[134:53.18]Why can't you writers leave it at the door?
[134:56.08]Please, fellas.
[134:59.46]Police!
[134:59.72]Police!
[135:00.16]I can't throw a punch in here.
[135:01.76]That's not allowed.
[135:02.54]Yeah.
[135:25.81]Where did this lady come from?
[135:27.20]I wanted to just blast some people in the face.
[135:35.16]This is not fair!
[135:35.84]Alright, now you fucking pissed me off.
[136:00.21]Now you've pissed me off.
[136:01.77]What is this, the fucking Three Stooges?
[136:08.94]Like, get out of here!
[136:09.88]Do I have to fight more people?
[136:35.23]This guy's a knife.
[136:36.25]Wait, why is this guy?
[136:37.97]I was trying to be a good person.
[137:06.66]Oh, my stomach.
[137:10.04]$62!
[137:19.28]These guys come up and start trouble with me, and I don't want to fight them.
[137:22.40]I eventually start throwing punches, get Curly Larry in mode for two straight minutes, and then a guy just guts me like a fish.
[137:30.10]A guy that had nothing to do with it.
[137:31.42]Why?
[137:38.46]Why didn't you outstab the other guys?
[137:46.30]Should have fought back from the beginning.
[137:47.54]I was trying to be the good guy.
[137:49.50]Alright, now let's play blackjack.
[137:56.95]You said something mean?
[137:57.95]No, I... Look, if somebody's gonna call me an asshole, I'm gonna be like, fuck you.
[138:05.80]Hey, you're a little piece of shit.
[138:08.22]Um... You're a dickhead.
[138:10.74]You're an idiot.
[138:12.86]That's how I reply.
[138:13.40]Go, you're an idiot.
[138:15.46]Idiot.
[138:20.10]Ah, well, what do we have here?
[138:21.32]Some kind of piece of shit.
[138:22.99]Garbage can motherfucker.
[138:25.11]Stupid idiot.
[138:31.31]Oh, God.
[138:33.49]Okay.
[138:34.19]Blackjack.
[138:34.77]Upstairs.
[138:35.71]No distractions.
[138:39.45]Where's the table?
[138:55.35]Okay, fellows.
[138:56.55]It's time for blackjack.
[138:57.65]Let's go.
[139:10.31]I don't need to know the details.
[139:11.45]I know how to play blackjack.
[139:14.13]Where are my cards?
[139:20.70]What do we got?
[139:21.14]A fucking four.
[139:21.64]Six?
[139:26.56]That's not good.
[139:29.14]Oh, God.
[139:41.12]Insurance.
[139:41.68]I'm not going to do insurance.
[139:42.78]Is it Blackjack?
[139:44.44]Oh, this is bad.
[139:48.34]Six.
[139:51.55]Nine.
[139:52.79]Gone.
[139:54.67]There's eleven.
[139:55.33]Yeah, I'll take one.
[139:57.69]Oh, you dickhead.
[139:58.09]Nine.
[139:58.19]Alright.
[139:58.53]Come on.
[139:59.59]Give me ten.
[139:59.99]Nineteen.
[140:00.27]Let's do it.
[140:01.99]That was a push.
[140:04.76]I pushed.
[140:05.14]I didn't lose.
[140:05.76]I pushed.
[140:34.93]I actually like this view better.
[140:36.13]Please put in your bets.
[140:39.36]Sure.
[140:40.56]Yeah, sure.
[140:41.84]Where's the high roller table so I can bet $1,000 a hand?
[140:45.04]Bets are now closed.
[140:46.32]Here we go.
[140:46.80]9.
[140:46.82]19.
[140:46.84]That's a stain.
[140:53.03]19.
[140:53.15]No.
[140:53.37]And 14.
[140:53.65]Pass me. 16.
[141:06.40]I don't have enough chips to double down.
[141:07.84]19.
[141:11.49]What is this bullshit?
[141:12.27]Another 19.
[141:19.37]Actually, I have to do two dollar bets because the achievement is to double down.
[141:23.20]So, I have to be ready for that.
[141:28.24]Because double down is the only way I can make this achievement here.
[141:38.35]Double on four.
[141:39.43]I think max bet is four.
[141:41.45]Alright, give me an ace.
[141:43.69]Give me an ace.
[141:45.77]That's a 20.
[141:46.09]That's 12.
[141:46.57]18.
[141:47.33]Alright.
[141:52.78]Double down.
[141:53.14]Looking for an ace.
[141:56.56]16.
[141:57.16]Stand.
[141:58.10]No, I don't want to split.
[141:59.58]14.
[141:59.80]Split against a three?
[142:01.36]Maybe if you had a five or a six, maybe. 15.
[142:06.99]11.
[142:07.94]Gimme card.
[142:08.50]20.
[142:08.52]13.
[142:09.60]Busted.
[142:09.86]Oh, that's right.
[142:14.62]Give me those chips.
[142:15.28]No, you can't.
[142:15.72]Double down on a 20.
[142:16.20]You get another card.
[142:16.88]You're guaranteed to lose.
[142:35.60]You can't split against a three.
[142:36.78]20?
[142:36.80]I'm just looking for the achievement at this point.
[142:44.53]That's it.
[142:45.05]Give me an ace.
[142:45.49]Ace!
[142:45.59]17.
[142:45.63]That's bad.
[142:58.35]Remember you you always got to assume that the dealer has a 10 under there So I mean I could stand here or I could fucking hit it and I think I'm gonna hit it You gotta do man he's gonna turn over a 10 you just lose anyways
[143:26.70]I don't know what's this.
[143:29.40]No, he's gonna bust.
[143:30.70]No, 20.
[143:30.92]That's it.
[143:36.34]You gotta always assume that there's a 10 under there.
[143:38.32]You have to.
[143:41.18]The dealer is forced to play until 17.
[143:42.84]That's correct.
[143:51.89]Bits are now closed.
[143:53.21]Here we go.
[143:55.46]Fucking three.
[143:56.68]No, that's a five.
[144:00.88]Thirteen.
[144:02.04]That's a fucking eight.
[144:04.22]Fifteen.
[144:04.98]Bullshit.
[144:05.60]Let's see how it does this time.
[144:08.37]There.
[144:08.55]Those are my cards.
[144:10.35]How dare you.
[144:12.95]Yep, card.
[144:14.81]Bust.
[144:15.51]You fucking dumb guy.
[144:17.85]Thanks a lot.
[144:21.07]Eighteen.
[144:25.38]You doubled?
[144:28.85]You doubled against an eight?
[144:30.01]What are you, stupid?
[144:32.83]What are you?
[144:34.13]What are you?
[144:34.43]What are you?
[144:34.95]An idiot?
[144:38.43]The guy on my right doesn't exist.
[144:40.21]That's why you never played a full table.
[144:47.16]Thank God.
[144:52.61]That guy was definitely the bad luck on the table, you know what I mean?
[144:57.13]That guy was the bad luck on the table.
[145:00.24]See, now watch this.
[145:01.60]Yeah, done.
[145:02.06]See?
[145:02.18]Although, he'll make two.
[145:03.26]He'll make 21 with a fucking two.
[145:04.26]God damn it, man.
[145:24.52]Am I allowed to win a hand of Black Shack or what?
[145:31.63]I'm gonna push every time and then lose.
[145:34.07]I need to double down.
[145:35.47]I need to get this achievement.
[145:38.51]There's a challenge to double down and win, but I'm not just gonna do it.
[145:41.21]You need to be in the right position.
[145:44.32]What a great start.
[145:45.16]A two.
[145:47.06]Ah, well here we go.
[145:47.62]Here it is.
[145:47.90]No!
[145:53.50]Did he say never lucky?
[146:03.47]I mean, I'm just trying to get the achievement.
[146:08.21]This is the worst thing I could possibly do, but I'm doing it.
[146:11.87]Okay, 20.
[146:14.05]Like, just let me win it.
[146:15.25]It's the stupidest thing ever.
[146:17.67]I'm gonna push again.
[146:22.37]Give me a break.
[146:23.43]Let me guess, is he gonna get a 20?
[146:45.87]That's 19, so what does he even have?
[146:47.31]Yeah.
[146:48.13]This is, this is, deal of showing a 6 is like, the biggest chance for you to win.
[146:57.58]And, here comes the bust.
[147:00.66]What the fuck?!
[147:04.04]Why?!
[147:05.44]A deal of showing 6 is like, the easiest, the most in-your-favor thing to win.
[147:14.83]Alright, let's see your bets.
[147:16.47]I can't, I haven't, can I fucking win anything?
[147:18.96]I haven't even lost anything.
[147:20.28]I've lost like two hands.
[147:22.84]That's it then.
[147:23.72]No more bets.
[147:24.44]Should I throw the table over and fucking karate chop this guy or what?
[147:30.74]17.
[147:30.76]19.
[147:30.86]Whatever.
[147:31.74]This is a hand to win.
[147:32.66]He's gonna pull over a 10.
[147:35.60]He's gonna bust.
[147:38.78]And 9.
[147:39.90]9.
[147:40.83]16.
[147:41.37]16.
[147:41.43]Bust card.
[147:41.77]Here it is.
[147:42.81]You motherfucker.
[147:43.69]No!
[147:52.96]How many shoes are we playing here?
[147:59.61]How many decks?
[148:00.07]There's one deck?
[148:01.09]My fucking god.
[148:01.83]He better not have it.
[148:02.45]Let me guess.
[148:23.50]14.
[148:23.52]15.
[148:24.38]Oh wow, the dealer busted on.
[148:31.09]Unbelievable.
[148:32.67]First time.
[148:35.11]It's daytime.
[148:38.27]Okay, I gotta double down some more, because I have to win five double downs.
[148:43.31]I'm only here for the achievement.
[148:44.31]I'm not here because I love this game, and Blackjack's one of my favorite games.
[148:46.86]That's why I'm here.
[148:47.82]I'm here to get the achievement.
[148:49.52]11. 11.
[148:52.07]And 14.
[148:53.90]That's 12.
[148:55.56]I mean, you can't hit this.
[148:57.02]I don't have enough money to double down.
[149:09.79]This is like... It's your turn.
[149:12.19]Card, please.
[149:13.85]Oh, that's a bust.
[149:15.27]Fucking told you guys.
[149:16.19]Crap.
[149:17.48]I told you guys.
[149:19.12]Against a 4, 5, or 6.
[149:20.90]And why are you... I should have played the fundamentals.
[149:23.32]Because he's going to bust.
[149:24.94]Watch this.
[149:25.38]Bang.
[149:26.52]I told you.
[149:28.54]I got to play fucking blackjack fundamentals.
[149:33.39]You're supposed to stand there.
[149:39.29]I don't know why I even listened to the chat room.
[149:41.05]That's it then.
[149:41.89]No more bets.
[149:47.39]16.
[149:48.79]Go on.
[149:50.49]18.
[149:51.69]Thanks.
[149:52.97]15.
[149:53.51]I'll take your card.
[149:55.91]19.
[149:56.29]That's fine with me.
[149:57.86]Push me again, sir.
[149:58.98]13.
[149:59.92]Sorry, but... Things are definitely looking up.
[150:05.62]Okay, then.
[150:08.22]These little guys are actually playing with one cent.
[150:10.22]Come on, man.
[150:10.81]Yes, sir.
[150:16.14]You're like the grandma that sits at the slot machine and plays one line, one credit.
[150:20.06]And they sit there all day and smoke four packs of cigarettes.
[150:24.24]What does he got?
[150:28.72]What's his card?
[150:29.84]15?
[150:30.36]Oh, it's dead.
[150:36.03]Busted.
[150:37.33]Oh my fucking god.
[150:38.51]How many cards?
[150:39.27]How many low cards are you gonna pull out of there?
[150:46.01]Alright, let's see your bets.
[150:49.02]Yes.
[150:53.44]No more bets.
[150:54.14]Let's start.
[151:04.04]I'm about to pull the gun off.
[151:05.60]That's it.
[151:13.65]Just double down every time.
[151:15.33]I'm gonna lose all my money.
[151:16.47]Uh... That's it, then.
[151:22.43]No more bets.
[151:25.60]Just give me something more.
[151:26.54]Give me, like... It's 20, but I don't... I don't really want... I want, like, an 11.
[151:30.72]You know what I mean?
[151:32.52]Something I can actually double down on.
[151:34.76]Like, give me a 10, or a 9, or a 10... 9, 10, 11.

[156:53.23]Bets are open now.
[156:55.97]You actually can't double down on a blackjack.
[156:59.03]It depends where you are.
[157:00.47]There are plenty of casinos around here that you don't have to take the blackjack.
[157:03.07]You can just play it.
[157:10.18]Double down.
[157:10.52]Here it comes.

[157:52.52]Alright, whatever.

[158:17.17]I just need to do that three more times.
[158:18.85]Where's my progress update?
[158:26.61]Did that not count?
[158:28.29]Why did the counter not show up? 20.
[158:48.91]Unless it was the first progress, you did get it.
[158:54.81]Okay.
[158:56.59]I'm playing Blackjack so awfully right now, but it's just to double down every hand.
[159:02.07]And I would have won if I didn't fucking do that.
[159:09.60]See you in 60 minutes when we get three other double downs.
[159:13.86]How much money do I have?
[159:18.15]I'm gonna run out of money.
[159:18.85]I have to be careful.
[159:19.53]There's an ace.
[159:23.52]No blackjack.
[159:25.52]Alright.
[159:25.70]Alright.
[159:26.02]Do I just double down?
[159:29.94]Just double down.
[159:43.54]Fifteen.
[159:44.80]Hey, I think I'm gonna double.
[159:46.75]Fifteen.
[159:47.81]Fifteen.
[159:48.61]Eight.
[159:49.63]That was a good play.
[159:51.31]Sixteen.
[159:51.99]Hit.
[159:54.69]No, they definitely don't have... That's almost impossible to do that consecutively.
[159:57.87]I'm just looking for a bust here.
[160:01.69]And fourteen.
[160:02.49]Fourteen busts.
[160:03.93]Oh my fucking Kimia.
[160:06.05]Break.
[160:06.39]Please put in your bets.

[160:38.56]He just got an ace.
[160:40.11]I just... 21.
[160:44.09]There comes number three.
[160:46.85]Don't get it.
[160:48.13]Don't do it.
[160:49.23]Thank God.
[160:50.47]Alright, there's three.
[160:54.77]Only two more and we can get up.
[160:55.93]Alright, let's see your bets.
[161:04.99]Uh, okay.
[161:07.64]Have I seen Jeremy do this before on a rerun?
[161:09.40]Alright, come on.
[161:09.90]Yeah!
[161:10.08]Seventeen.
[161:10.58]Not the plan.
[161:30.96]Alright.
[161:33.22]13.
[161:34.20]I will double.
[161:37.20]18.
[161:37.22]18.
[161:37.28]Flip over a 10, and let's win it.
[161:39.86]15.
[161:40.16]No!
[161:40.82]Sorry.
[161:41.64]Yes!
[161:43.14]Only one more.
[161:45.50]Yeah.
[161:46.40]I'm going to do that one more time.
[161:48.80]Put in your bets.
[161:58.21]That's it, then.
[161:59.09]No more bets.
[162:01.20]Alright.
[162:01.80]Ace.
[162:02.88]Actually, no.
[162:03.24]Not an ace.
[162:04.28]Oh, I can't double down this.
[162:06.90]I don't care about winning this right now.
[162:12.72]Why was I thinking about pressing double down?
[162:16.54]Double down and try to get an ace.
[162:19.89]I would've had it.
[162:21.05]I would've got it.
[162:23.05]If I double down right there, I would've got that ace.
[162:27.31]You gotta be kidding me.
[162:31.74]Oh my God, that's so sad.
[162:33.96]No balls.
[162:37.14]Hope to see you for the next one.
[162:38.78]Bets are open now.
[162:43.23]Gone.
[162:44.41]Alright, bets are now closed.
[162:49.41]18.
[162:49.47]I can't double down on this.
[162:53.11]There, 19.
[162:53.91]Stick.
[162:57.20]Always double down.
[162:58.22]Not on 20.
[162:58.92]You can't double down on 20.
[163:03.11]I can't believe that I just lost right there.
[163:07.87]Now I'm the one that's here the longest.
[163:10.25]Alright, let's see your bets.
[163:12.95]Yeah, but anyone who wants to give me criticism, I'm just going to yell at them like, I'm trying to get the achievement.
[163:18.21]Bets are now closed.
[163:19.49]Here we go.
[163:19.91]And 14.
[163:23.66]I'm going to double down.
[163:27.38]Well, the dealer's been here the longest.
[163:34.99]See, the dealer is making money.
[163:36.37]And there are people that are just question-marking around.
[163:43.75]Anyone that just comes in right now will just think I'm an idiot.
[163:47.90]That I just don't understand this game.
[163:50.84]I just double down every hand.
[163:52.48]It's double the money.
[163:53.40]What does that mean?
[163:57.71]If you know how to play Blackjack, I look stupid right now.
[164:02.38]Bust.
[164:02.74]You look stupid either way.
[164:04.34]That guy needs to be banned forever.
[164:10.08]For life.
[164:10.60]For life.
[164:27.22]I'm running out of sense to double down on here.
[164:29.64]14.
[164:29.66]Flip over a...
[164:43.52]Okay, don't flip over a ten.
[164:51.88]Blackjack requires zero skill.
[164:54.45]I have a little bit of news for you here.
[164:58.83]None of them do.
[165:00.29]The only one that requires any actual real skill is Poker.
[165:03.87]None of these do.
[165:04.35]Okay, I'll do two cents.
[165:14.19]I had newsflash.
[165:19.47]No, I can't double down on this.
[165:31.88]20.
[165:33.24]Double down.
[165:35.26]Oh, that's a bust.
[165:41.14]Let me can't strike twice guys Some of the card games require thought but best skill Skill oh, I don't have enough money to double down here.
[165:58.35]I'm getting up They require a thought but at the end of the day it's random cards being it's being thrown down I
[166:13.79]I need to get it one more time.
[166:15.19]I have to get a double down one more time.
[166:23.15]So then we can be done with this.
[166:27.10]Nobody sits down at a slot machine and is like, Wow, I'm really good at this.
[166:36.48]You mean to tell me that there's a computer algorithm that makes me lose?
[166:42.52]85 percent of the time but no this is the special machine I said this one I take up the whole row of this one buffalo machine and I put in five cents on each one and I go click click click click click click across the whole row 19. how much did I just bet no oh stand 15.
[167:14.16]You dummy.
[167:15.00]You dummy.
[167:16.88]I just... Just do one cent bets.
[167:22.86]Okay, we got eights.
[167:31.57]We got eights.
[167:32.11]We're splitting it.
[167:41.62]No blackjack, right?
[167:42.50]We're splitting these eights.
[167:44.76]16.
[167:45.08]Split them.
[167:46.05]Split, I think.
[167:47.81]What a nice thing to say right here.
[167:50.61]Oh, baby.
[167:52.27]10.
[167:52.29]11.
[167:52.49]Yep.
[167:54.61]Card.
[167:56.53]12.
[167:57.19]Do it again.
[167:57.89]Again.
[167:58.25]Card.
[167:58.37]Sorry.
[167:58.73]10.
[167:59.66]Card, please.
[168:00.06]20.
[168:00.12]I'm good. 18.
[168:13.73]By the way, splitting eights versus a face card on the table.
[168:18.05]Do not ever do this for any reason.
[168:22.02]Don't ever do that.
[168:22.98]I did it for the effect of the comedy.
[168:27.30]There you go.
[168:28.86]That's why you don't do that.
[168:31.42]That's the reason why you never do that.
[168:37.19]Always split aces and eights.
[168:38.47]I disagree.
[168:39.55]Because if the guy's showing a face card, you're going to lose twice as much money.
[168:42.96]Like, right there, he flipped it over.
[168:44.16]I would say, in the jermaOn A5, Gambler's Handbook.
[168:50.68]I know the... Always split eights, no matter what.
[168:55.44]I don't fucking buy it.
[168:58.66]Alright, double down on this one.
[169:05.69]Fifteen.
[169:06.84]I'mma double down.
[169:08.64]There.
[169:09.56]Nineteen.
[169:10.48]Nineteen.
[169:10.98]Don't flip.
[169:11.70]It's gonna be twenty.
[169:13.84]Nineteen.
[169:16.94]It's seven.
[169:18.24]Hit me.
[169:20.08]Fourteen.
[169:20.88]Violating TOS.
[169:22.06]Teaching people how to gamble.
[169:23.42]I'm talking about in Red Dead Redemption 2's blackjack fake blackjack table.
[169:28.42]Flip over a seven.
[169:31.03]Thirteen.
[169:32.09]Busted.
[169:33.45]Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
[169:39.10]Okay.
[169:40.12]I did it.
[169:42.20]Win three games of Five Finger Filet.
[169:46.18]That's it.
[169:46.46]I'm going out on top.
[170:08.13]Can I put, like, predator bait over here?
[170:14.82]Hold on.
[170:15.74]Can I get a bear to come in?
[170:18.12]What?
[170:21.50]I'm okay.
[170:40.43]What are you actually doing?
[170:42.25]How's your book?
[170:44.79]Too sober to smile.
[170:46.71]Barman always has a solution.
[171:07.25]I see something.
[171:07.71]What's that?
[171:08.53]You see that?
[171:08.89]Oh, it's just a reflection.
[171:10.81]Alright, Five Finger Filet.
[171:15.09]Let's get these gambler things out of the way.
[171:22.97]Why did we come here?
[171:23.59]I forget.
[171:27.57]Now, there is no Five Finger Filet in this town.
[171:31.67]I'm sorry.
[171:32.09]Oh, we're gonna go to GR.
[171:35.40]There is a bath, though.
[171:37.33]Is there a bath?
[171:40.09]Can I bathe at the saloon?
[171:47.75]Just came back.
[171:48.25]I didn't lose any or earn any... No, I wasn't trying to.
[171:50.26]I was just trying to get the gambler achievement, man.
[171:56.20]Who?
[172:07.04]Who are you looking for?
[172:08.70]Hello, mister.
[172:10.70]Listen, have you seen... I'm looking for my friend, Gavin.
[172:14.18]Gavin?
[172:16.16]I don't know any Gavins, I'm afraid.
[172:19.51]English bloke.
[172:20.69]Lovely fella.
[172:22.05]He went missing and now I'm all alone.
[172:24.65]Good luck.
[172:30.71]That's it.
[172:31.33]That's, uh... That's too bad.
[172:46.26]Did I... Did I kill his friend?
[172:50.70]Oh, that's really... Kevin!
[172:56.02]Kevin!
[172:57.94]Kevin!
[172:58.68]Kevin!
[173:00.18]Where the hell are you?
[173:02.18]Kevin!
[173:03.60]Kevin!
[173:04.26]I hope you find Kevin.
[173:15.71]When was the last time you saw Kevin?
[173:22.61]If we see a guy named Kevin anymore, make sure you say something.
[173:36.22]I think that's all I can do with this guy.
[173:40.02]Press 0 to help him.
[173:41.60]Press circle to help him.
[173:48.31]Jeremy, he's saying Gavin.
[173:50.29]You want to ride the donkey?
[174:07.76]It's giving me an option to do something here.
[174:09.18]What is it?
[174:21.02]What are you doing?
[174:21.64]I just didn't hear the guy calling Gavin.
[174:28.76]Gavin!
[174:35.52]Free the donkey?
[174:36.40]How am I supposed to do that?
[174:39.30]I can't free him.
[174:40.64]I can't pull a gun out.
[174:41.54]I can't do anything here.
[174:42.34]Alright, we're gonna go to Gavin.
[174:44.88]G-R.
[174:52.13]Uh, why am I not eating anything?
[175:07.22]More food, please.
[175:07.96]Okay.
[175:20.98]I kind of want my horse, because this is much further than I thought it was.
[176:01.81]I couldn't see him!
[176:04.81]No witnesses, nobody can see.
[176:10.03]Easy, don't run over anybody else.
[176:21.58]You wanted me to have a word with some folk on the property racially deputized you see if you test And I suppose Lee was drunk when he did it look you can come in, but you ain't talking with me obliged Hey, I was hoping you talk him on I
[176:49.41]I'm a student of the history of the region.
[176:51.75]I ain't the one to speak to.
[176:53.73]Try Master Bo.
[176:54.85]Think he's down there by the wood store.
[176:57.25]Boy's got all the time in the world.
[176:59.55]Okay.
[176:59.73]Let's get back on the horse.
[177:09.19]I just kind of ruined their stuff.
[177:10.33]That's fine.
[177:13.41]Are you the boy that I'm looking for?
[177:15.29]BG.
[177:21.50]Definitely because I'm slowing down.
[177:23.37]Huh.
[177:25.69]I'll see you at the sheriff's office.
[177:30.51]Excuse me, friend.
[177:32.69]We friends?
[177:33.65]Not yet, but here's hoping.
[177:35.57]I guess.
[177:36.93]We don't get a lot of traveling men here.
[177:39.17]And suddenly, there's a whole phalanx of mysterious but strangely helpful Yankees.
[177:44.69]Oh, shit the hat.
[177:45.53]What are you doing here?
[177:46.96]I was just looking for work.
[177:48.86]Well, looking for something.
[177:51.10]Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
[177:52.98]What secret?
[177:53.74]I got a secret of my own.
[177:54.98]Are you secretly normal?
[177:56.46]Excuse me?
[177:56.90]Never mind.
[177:58.67]That sounds just like improv.
[178:00.37]Like an improv routine on stage.
[178:02.33]I don't know why.
[178:03.15]Right?
[178:12.36]She's a Braithwaite.
[178:13.54]I'm Bo Gray, son of Tavish Gray, nephew of Lee Gray, the sheriff, grandson of old Murdo Gray.
[178:20.78]We Grays have been loyal to the state and murderous to the Braithwaites for so long now, no one can even quite explain why.
[178:27.35]But just because he's got the fucking hair, all of a sudden he becomes me.
[178:31.35]I'm supposed to be loyal to some nonsense while she...
[178:35.39]My hair is not that long.
[178:36.97]She's like a woman from the future.
[178:39.47]She's like tomorrow, if tomorrow turns out fine.
[178:42.65]Well, I'm sorry for your predicament.
[178:45.37]Would you help?
[178:46.32]I don't wanna get involved.
[178:48.24]Gang feuds, it seems unseemly.
[178:51.38]I'll pay.
[178:52.26]I've got money.
[178:53.42]We Greys, we've always got money.
[178:54.94]No brains mine, but money.
[178:58.02]I know she loves to sit out in the gazebo on the edge of the Braithwaite property.
[179:03.32]And you'll never hear from me ever again.
[179:12.93]Sneak into the grounds around Braithwaite Manor.
[179:15.87]Where's my little friend?
[179:38.38]Hey, come on then.
[179:44.18]What the fuck happened?
[179:45.39]What the fuck?
[179:47.27]What?
[179:48.87]Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[179:51.17]What?
[179:57.33]What?
[179:57.67]Hey!
[179:58.20]I'm getting shot out of a cannon.
[180:05.98]Like you were saying before
[180:13.41]We won't run over anybody.
[180:22.57]Shut up.
[180:24.17]Two guards.
[180:24.83]Who do you think you are?
[180:25.57]That was a little delayed reaction on my part.
[180:48.32]That's pretty good music.
[181:00.27]And I still have no shoes on.
[181:01.47]That's right.
[181:08.33]So, sneak into this manor.
[181:14.56]Workers.
[181:15.02]Watch out for workers.
[181:18.52]They're like land mines.
[181:19.45]I just don't want to step on them.
[181:20.53]What?
[181:20.91]Stay.
[181:51.56]Sneak past the guards.
[181:53.35]So they're... Alright, there's a guy that way.
[181:59.43]I can't even see the banner.
[182:00.35]It's so foggy.
[182:02.51]There's the banner.
[182:03.19]Looks like there's one guard out front, but there might be another one.
[182:09.82]Is that it?
[182:12.06]I think it's just this one guy.
[182:13.98]Okay, he's right there.
[182:21.56]He's turning How close do they have to be I guess maybe not that I guess I'm fine I
[183:02.28]One guy over that way.
[183:04.52]Just gonna keep it expanded the whole time.
[183:12.94]Why would you do the double foot stomp there?
[183:15.14]Okay, how much further away are you?
[183:32.13]Where is Penelope?
[183:36.84]You just sit at the lake?
[183:39.24]Apparently.
[183:39.76]I don't think there's anybody else.
[183:46.41]No, that's it.
[184:11.25]Wet socks.
[184:12.07]I don't have any socks on.
[184:29.51]I guess I made it, so does she know I'm coming?
[184:53.79]I made it.
[184:55.43]Hello.
[184:55.55]Are you Penelope Braithwaite?
[184:57.66]Why, yes, I am.
[184:58.98]I've got a letter for you.
[185:04.47]Oh.
[185:04.53]And a gift.
[185:06.09]A letter and a gift.
[185:07.01]Well, we don't even know each other.
[185:08.95]Well, it's not from me.
[185:10.07]It's from... From Bo.
[185:12.71]Oh, he's so... Strange?
[185:17.01]Yes, he's a little strange, but also so human.
[185:21.19]The rest of our families are stuck in the Dark Ages or...
[185:25.71]Well, I don't know.
[185:26.69]Cave people, perhaps.
[185:28.77]Bo's different.
[185:30.09]But if they find out, they'll kill him and send me to live someplace awful like... Handsome?
[185:36.71]Smart?
[185:37.27]Funny?
[185:38.42]Have you ever been to Ohio, sir?
[185:40.42]No.
[185:40.96]Well, neither have I. But my uncle has a factory there.
[185:44.70]He was sort of the black sheep on account of having left.
[185:48.46]But now they tolerate him because he's a vicious snob.
[185:53.97]Families are... They're something else.
[185:58.13]You got a family, sir?
[185:59.61]No, not really.
[186:01.43]Well, they tolerate him because of the money.
[186:04.15]But me, with my ideas above my station, they can't stand.
[186:09.05]That sounds pretty complicated.
[186:11.98]I don't know quite what to say.
[186:14.00]Nothing to say, except I hope they all rot.
[186:16.02]I don't.
[186:19.26]Well, maybe a bit.
[186:21.55]Why'd I have to sneak up on this lady?
[186:22.67]Because the guards there would not let me in.
[186:33.01]Leave the area without being seen.
[186:36.15]Uh... Well, there's a big body of water right here.
[186:42.35]That looks pretty good to me.
[187:00.31]Wait, hold on.
[187:03.49]Not when I'm gonna swim across the Atlantic?
[187:07.05]Hold on a minute.
[187:10.95]Not the Atlantic, the Pacific?
[187:12.53]What about ocean?
[187:13.36]I'm gonna swim this way.
[187:27.63]Okay, just give me a second.
[187:30.71]I need to heal my lightning bolt.
[187:36.92]Well, I mean, like, actually heal it.
[187:39.90]Do I have one that's just lightning bolt?
[187:45.14]I don't think I do.
[187:47.72]Yeah, I do.
[187:52.63]There we go.
[188:00.26]We're going right over here.
[188:14.53]What's with the music?
[188:15.37]It really is just 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1.
[188:17.25]This sounds like when you used to have CDs on in the car, and they would just skip.
[188:36.66]Okay.
[188:37.44]Where is everybody?
[188:38.10]Am I far away enough now?
[188:39.06]Oh, I'm way far away.
[188:56.65]Okay.
[188:57.95]That is the first silver medal.
[189:00.05]Oh.
[189:01.09]Oh well.
[189:04.94]Alright, let's go back.
[189:06.78]Return.
[189:07.72]I can take this away from him regular.
[189:09.56]Come on.
[189:16.37]Come on.
[189:21.75]I think I did a pretty good job.
[189:26.12]Bye.
[189:26.38]So now I gotta bring this back to...
[189:36.56]Uh... What?
[189:42.03]Was any over here?
[189:42.67]Um... In the morning, maybe?
[189:54.28]Maybe it's time to sleep.
[190:10.03]Go to the outhouse.
[190:12.61]Um... That's not an outhouse.
[190:17.07]What do you mean, the outhouse?
[190:21.63]These people don't... Do these people know me?
[190:23.85]What are they all waiting for?
[190:26.79]They're all looking for something.
[190:29.73]This one.
[190:32.91]Can't go in there.
[190:37.86]One blazes...
[190:40.65]Well, I- I like- I gotta get out of here.
[190:42.25]I'm not sto- Okay, there's people there, people there.
[190:45.17]I gotta get- No, like, I'm not looking around for an outhouse.
[190:46.95]These people are looking for me.
[191:05.65]Let's go.
[191:06.19]Out.
[191:14.13]Bye.
[191:16.27]Didn't I pay my bounties?
[191:19.55]Who's in front of me?
[191:20.15]Why does this person have a thing on them?
[191:24.18]What?
[191:25.00]Who the hell are you?
[191:25.78]You're not a bounty hunter.
[191:26.64]You're just a guy.
[191:34.97]That was just a guy.
[191:42.19]Okay, I think I'm going this way now.
[191:44.67]Oh, they're still coming.
[191:46.29]Apparently they're still going this way.
[191:52.55]I need to find- I gotta camp.
[191:56.32]Let's camp up over here.
[191:57.68]This is not the wilderness.
[192:17.93]Oh.
[192:18.33]It's because I'm in combat.
[192:22.47]And he'll figure it out.
[192:46.95]Okay, we're good.
[192:49.43]Time to sleep.
[192:53.21]Time to go to sleep.
[193:02.60]Until morning.
[193:25.26]Okay.
[193:27.44]Tear down the camp.
[193:35.39]Hey, stupid streamer, do something funny.
[193:37.25]Alright.
[193:46.07]So we gotta go back here.
[193:52.38]Bow of Gray.
[194:00.69]Mr. Gray.
[194:01.93]Are you doing great?
[194:07.19]Thanks!
[194:07.75]I feel pretty great.
[194:26.11]Whoa.
[194:27.95]Who do you think the first Ree was?
[194:33.11]You know, back like in the 1400s.
[194:34.05]Watch out for people.
[194:43.76]What's up, frog?
[194:46.26]Let's hand the letter back, and then I think it's time to hunt a legend every animal.
[195:03.54]I'm feeling a legendary beast.
[195:12.60]I'm back and I have something for you.
[195:15.80]The legendary rat.
[195:21.18]I'll go for the rat.
[195:27.77]Sure.
[195:28.73]Did she give anything?
[195:30.39]For me?
[195:30.63]How much?
[195:31.17]Yes.
[195:32.31]Might I have it?
[195:33.37]Sure.
[195:34.79]But it'll cost you.
[195:39.93]I can't be bothered.
[195:41.45]Here, take it.
[195:42.91]Thank you, Arthur.
[195:45.95]Thank you.
[195:50.19]My God.
[195:52.53]What a woman.
[195:55.05]She's a woman is killed for sure.
[195:57.94]It's an idiot.
[195:58.94]I could explain this suffrage around here.
[196:01.56]They don't even like men voting.
[196:03.28]They bring back the monarchy given half the chance.
[196:05.99]Progress is a dirty word in these parts.
[196:09.11]Unlike incest.
[196:10.25]Excuse me.
[196:10.93]I don't want to marry my cousin Matilda.
[196:12.69]I want to marry Penelope, but they're going to.
[196:17.13]What a woman.
[196:17.93]So this is part two.
[196:41.79]How much money was it?
[196:42.83]I didn't even see.
[196:43.65]It was not even enough money for me to bat an eye at.
[196:47.23]Is that what this is?
[196:48.67]Well, he's so rich.
[197:11.43]My favorite part about these streams is definitely the fact that... What?
[197:17.73]Who's... No.
[197:18.05]Um... Everybody that comes in asks about the braided tail.
[197:19.73]What's with the braid, man?
[197:40.51]Bo, what are you doing here?
[197:43.07]This guy's got a braided horse's tail?
[197:45.25]Where the fuck did that come from?
[197:47.95]I'm prepared to die for the cause, Bo.
[197:50.28]You know that.
[197:52.34]Do something, please.
[197:54.20]Do what?
[197:56.94]We must begin.
[197:58.50]Leave me alive.
[198:00.50]This is no laughing matter, sir.
[198:03.34]They need protecting from certain elements.
[198:08.21]Mostly my family.
[198:09.91]Penelope, I beg you.
[198:11.97]I'll tell you what.
[198:13.22]Your friend here can drive the wagon for us.
[198:15.58]It'll allow us to shout all the louder.
[198:17.91]Hooray!
[198:18.51]Sure.
[198:21.40]Miss Calhoun.
[198:23.25]Miss Calhoun.
[198:24.87]Arthur really is a great guy.
[198:27.35]Well, Olive Calhoun.
[198:29.51]Normally I like to drive myself, but today I feel like a man joining us sends the right message.
[198:35.80]Well, I ain't never been in a protest march before, madam.
[198:40.90]Well, just treat us like the sheep and the folks attacking us like the wolves and I'm sure you'll feel right at home.
[198:47.75]Shall we go?
[198:50.37]Oh, there's too many people here.
[198:53.15]Don't give me the frames.
[198:56.15]There's too many people.
[198:57.35]I don't think you understand.
[199:10.88]I don't think you understand.
[199:12.98]Take us down Main Street.
[199:16.49]Oh.
[199:16.59]What was your name?
[199:20.03]Arthur Morgan.
[199:21.99]Very good, Mr. Morgan.
[199:23.61]And people walking on the sides.
[199:25.22]You don't want to be there.
[199:26.54]We need them to hear our voice.
[199:29.46]We'll hear it, alright.
[199:33.58]I'm so scared to do this.
[199:34.72]Shotgun, he said it.
[199:35.46]He just said it.
[199:48.18]Message will be delivered peaceably.
[199:49.84]Mr. Morgan.
[199:50.92]You can keep your shotgun.
[199:52.96]Oh, you keep saying it the one you're making me say it Watch out lady on the left you're gonna get squished between the fence lady.
[200:02.18]Oh
[200:18.29]Oh, do give it a rest, you sorry fool.
[200:22.29]Mr. Morgan, I give you the mail of the species.
[200:26.26]Yeah, that's a pretty dumb specimen, I grant it.
[200:31.58]The thing in the road.
[200:32.58]There's a thing in the road.
[200:33.50]Get on out of here.
[200:35.52]Those are the steps, Mr. Morgan.
[200:37.14]Stop in front there.
[200:38.64]Those are the steps.
[200:39.96]Who is this?
[200:42.46]This spot is fine, sir.
[200:44.46]Ladies?
[200:44.84]Get down.
[200:46.42]Come on.
[200:48.71]Go home.
[200:50.07]Shut your mouth.
[200:51.11]What are you doing?
[200:53.07]Oh, my God.
[200:54.47]Shit.
[200:55.01]You're causing all this trouble.
[200:56.89]You don't even know.
[200:59.91]Damn it.
[201:01.93]What the hell?
[201:04.95]Arthur really just added on.
[201:23.86]Fair, equal, and free, just as the Founding Fathers intended.
[201:29.27]Founding Fathers, not Founding Mothers, you silly old goons.
[201:36.02]He's philosophy dependent on...
[201:39.42]What the hell are you doing here, boy?
[201:40.82]Keep your voice down.
[201:41.94]I'm trying to listen to the speech.
[201:43.26]Hello, darling cousin.
[201:45.16]Don't you ever speak to me like that.
[201:48.12]What are you doing here?
[201:49.22]Listening, I suppose.
[201:50.80]Go help Bo.
[201:52.16]His cousin is a moron.
[201:53.48]Stop them from ruining the speech.
[201:56.98]You'll learn yourself some manners, cousin.
[202:00.30]Haven't you got anything better to do?
[202:02.82]Bo, where are we just leaving?
[202:06.88]Who the hell is this?
[202:08.39]Follow me around here.
[202:09.93]Who or what?
[202:11.57]You'll hit me?
[202:12.89]Come on.
[202:14.45]Sir, can you not see how idiotic you are?
[202:18.46]Come on, Bo.
[202:19.12]Let's go.
[202:20.82]Quick now.
[202:22.86]We are all Americans.
[202:27.68]Let's try.
[202:29.00]Brother!
[202:39.63]Oh, hell.
[202:41.31]Choke him.
[202:42.61]Get out of here, you bastard.
[202:44.78]You've gone too far.
[202:51.42]Special roundhouse kick.
[203:02.87]He was like a figure skater.
[203:06.25]Come on, Bo.
[203:07.35]Let's go.
[203:08.67]Quick now.
[203:11.75]Oops.
[203:51.03]Get out of my way!
[204:03.34]Alright, let's go.
[204:13.50]Follow me.
[204:14.16]I know a place.
[204:15.61]It's an old battlefield no one goes to.
[204:25.91]I'm stained.
[204:26.52]I'm stained.
[204:27.52]I'm stained.
[204:28.36]Okay?
[204:30.13]Why would I- I'm not gonna do that.
[204:58.04]I missed the old Jerma.
[204:59.78]A guy that would- What?
[205:00.58]What do you mean?
[205:03.28]You think old Jerma would have just ran into those people?
[205:13.18]Y'all wanna prove it?
[205:13.96]Oh, here we go.
[205:14.82]Nobody died.
[205:15.62]Ain't that awful.
[205:17.25]My cousins are vindictive bastards.
[205:19.91]My brothers are vindictive bastards.
[205:21.69]My cousins are worse.
[205:22.77]They started it.
[205:23.83]I know.
[205:24.83]But- You should leave.
[205:28.37]I will, as soon as I have enough money.
[205:30.59]When my family, we have money, but I don't.
[205:34.91]Is your family very rich?
[205:36.89]Yes, well, I believe so.
[205:39.07]But, uh, they keep me out of the discussions.
[205:42.17]I have more of a... artistic temperament, so... Well, is that what they call it?
[205:47.61]Yes.
[205:48.63]Oh, you made a joke.
[205:50.87]I really love her.
[205:51.86]I do.
[205:52.62]Well, stick around.
[205:53.74]Maybe you can die for her as well.
[205:55.86]I thought you were trying to make me feel better.
[205:58.48]That's a bunch of cash.
[205:59.54]How much was it?
[206:01.80]Thirty dollars.
[206:02.36]Ooh.
[206:39.99]Micah is blinking.
[206:41.09]It's just like, please go do the Micah mission.
[206:44.58]It's just like, look at it.
[206:45.22]It's just like, come on, man.
[206:46.34]I'm sitting right here waiting for you.
[206:50.80]Did not do this, and I wanted to.
[206:52.68]Let's go get the money.
[207:00.53]Hunt the turkey?
[207:01.55]Oh, there's so much to do!
[207:03.31]What's close to here?
[207:05.91]Okay, we've got legendary... No, that's not legendary.
[207:11.84]Let's take a look at the legendary map.
[207:14.90]Legendary turkey?
[207:15.66]Let's see where he is.
[207:25.63]Where is the legendary turkey?
[207:31.70]Uh... There is no legendary turkey.
[207:42.44]As much as we all wish there was.
[207:53.34]Who farted?
[207:53.92]What do you mean, who farted?
[207:59.40]Show me a clip.
[208:01.73]What was it?
[208:02.11]Let me see it.
[208:06.15]Go get the rat.
[208:08.79]Let me see it.
[208:12.76]I don't hear it.
[208:15.24]I'm ready to hear it.
[208:33.33]Oh, that's not it.
[208:42.86]I really want to hear it.
[208:44.44]Did somebody get it?
[208:52.55]Too lazy to clip.
[209:01.17]Okay, let's see.
[209:09.87]Okay.
[209:10.21]I don't know what that was.
[209:14.92]There is no legendary turkey.
[209:22.18]I don't know.
[209:22.72]It's in the game somewhere.
[209:26.92]I don't know what the hell that was.
[209:27.86]It was probably the horse.
[209:38.30]Alright.
[209:38.54]Let's go to get the legendary beaver.
[209:43.77]Well, where are we?
[209:45.10]Where are we currently standing right now?
[209:51.88]So, what's down here?
[209:53.36]In this area of the map?
[209:57.07]Because this is the northern section.
[209:59.21]What's, like, right next to the lake or the water or the river or whatever in the middle?
[210:02.19]Okay, we've got foxes.
[210:06.03]Pigs.
[210:06.65]Let's go for the pig.
[210:08.59]Beaver.
[210:16.18]We'll go take a look down here.
[210:24.64]Although this is... It's over here, isn't it?
[210:27.58]Just go look over here.
[210:32.80]Hunt the turkey.
[210:33.78]There's no legendary turkey!
[210:38.82]That don't exist!
[210:51.93]There is a legendary turkey.
[211:03.39]Well, I didn't see it on the map.
[211:09.86]What is this?
[211:23.77]Someone told me to pass this on, but it almost sucks.
[211:26.39]My hat!
[211:27.51]Hey!
[211:28.07]Is that it?
[211:58.64]I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!
[212:02.91]Where's my other weapons?
[212:10.95]Why did I just default and go back to the horse?
[212:24.36]Am I shooting with my TV off?
[212:25.92]No.
[212:33.43]That guy's up top.
[212:42.75]He dug my TV.
[212:47.28]Think you can fucking do that to me?
[212:48.60]Got another guy behind me.
[212:52.32]Another guy over here.
[212:52.92]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[213:01.18]Senseless idiot.
[213:05.21]What are they defending here?
[213:18.78]Fire bottle.
[213:19.40]What?
[213:20.10]I can inspect something?
[213:23.69]Oh.
[213:24.67]Abandoned church.
[213:25.53]Let's write it down.
[213:32.77]Saw an old church.
[213:33.57]Found it interesting.
[213:34.25]Not sure why.
[213:50.10]Well, there's definitely something in there.
[213:55.27]One has to assume there's something in this church.
[214:02.19]There's a lockbox.
[214:07.35]Money.
[214:09.11]How much?
[214:09.43]Not bad.
[214:12.52]That's more than I got for just doing the mission.
[214:17.26]That's it.
[214:23.56]Anything else in the corner?
[214:24.42]There's something over here.
[214:25.12]Is that another one?
[214:29.80]There is another box.
[214:39.62]Pocket watch jewelry.
[214:41.24]Platinum earrings.
[214:43.42]Nice, okay.
[214:47.77]Another lockbox.
[214:50.23]That's three.
[214:53.23]Shoot bell.
[214:53.93]Shoot bell.
[214:54.61]Hold on, hold on.
[214:55.31]I'm just trying to pick up stuff, man.
[214:58.45]I need to have some money.
[214:59.22]I need to go buy something nice.
[215:01.80]Nothing else?
[215:06.54]Let's go up top.
[215:09.29]I didn't look over here yet.
[215:15.54]Rest by the fire.
[215:18.92]Nothing else.
[215:24.33]You can't buy a shot bell.
[215:26.31]I'm gonna shoot the bell.
[215:29.43]Everybody, just hold on a minute.
[215:30.83]I'm just trying to traverse.
[215:56.84]Well, that was for no reason.
[215:59.65]Okay.
[215:59.95]What about up in this weird hole?
[216:12.91]What was at the top?
[216:32.35]Something up here.
[216:32.91]It has to be a reason why there's something up here.
[216:34.77]Oh, I see something.
[216:44.99]There's a bird's nest up there.
[216:46.43]I gotta get back up there.
[216:47.48]I gotta get to the... There's a bird's nest.
[216:56.02]I gotta be able to get, like, some rare eggs.
[217:09.13]Cigarette card Ooh It's one of the railroads I just need three more of these and it's gonna be 250 if you land on it I'm gonna smoke some more cigarettes
[217:49.58]It's only 200?
[217:50.10]Ah, whatever.
[217:51.06]These look rare.
[217:53.81]It's a Magikarp.
[218:01.25]Is that it?
[218:05.65]There's one more thing in there.
[218:06.55]There's like a pack of gum in there.
[218:17.20]Whoa.
[218:17.98]Can I get up there?
[218:22.46]Shoot battle.
[218:23.78]I can get up there.
[218:54.28]Maybe not.
[219:07.63]Yep, let's get it.
[219:31.20]Cool.
[219:44.61]Well, I did it before.
[219:45.51]I did it that one time.
[219:48.71]Was that just a fluke?
[219:50.89]Did I actually do something cool, or was it... What if I was the legendary turkey?
[220:05.09]I don't think so.
[220:06.26]Alright, I'm in this area.
[220:10.06]I don't remember really what else to do besides... Oh, look at this.
[220:22.71]Lancaster shoulder computer.
[220:24.41]I need to get a chance to look at this thing.
[220:28.74]Enemy gangs.
[220:29.60]We've discovered a gang hideout.
[220:34.14]Well, I'll take everything in your whole entire house.
[220:36.10]Why can I not shoot this quick?
[220:52.51]Where are you?
[220:53.51]That's a fucking scarecrow.
[221:23.86]There's the house.
[221:35.15]Take what?
[221:36.23]What was I taking?
[221:37.29]Come on!
[221:38.23]It's going to the front door.
[221:41.33]Okay.
[221:41.93]Come on!
[221:42.99]I'm losing my patience!
[221:59.23]sitting right there
[222:31.31]Alright.
[222:31.93]Is he trying to go inside?
[222:34.33]Too bad I can't go in here.
[222:36.58]There's no way to get in this building?
[223:04.18]Oh, I thought that was a belt.
[223:09.26]You've got a lot of dynamite.
[223:10.72]Can I pick any of this up?
[223:11.52]There's nothing I can do with the dynamite?
[223:16.19]Can I drive a dynamite truck?
[223:22.29]Oh, man.
[223:23.07]I can't take any of this?
[223:34.89]Damn it.
[223:35.43]What about one of the little ones?
[223:40.85]That's unfortunate.
[224:00.86]Shoot it.
[224:01.36]I'm shooting.
[224:01.86]Oh, this thing is in bad condition.
[224:04.55]Very bad.
[224:05.09]Do I have to use two gun oils on this?
[224:09.27]I don't think I even have any more.
[224:11.03]Not here.
[224:27.57]Yeah, I need to go.
[224:28.44]My revolvers are really not good at all.
[224:31.40]But I cleared up this place.
[224:33.16]I might as well look around for something interesting.
[224:35.74]You know what I'm saying?
[224:38.78]Lockbox, candy bar, gold bar.
[224:41.97]Could be anything.
[224:43.39]Great.
[224:56.71]Amazing inventions!
[225:02.13]Are there settings to change to make the shooting better?
[225:08.73]Lockbox.
[225:21.73]Aged pirate rum and money.
[225:26.86]Not bad.
[225:31.64]What about this house?
[225:40.45]That's a lot of fucking pez.
[225:45.56]Strawberry pez.
[225:46.58]I need to heal.
[225:52.74]How many of these do I have?
[225:57.99]Just need a drink.
[226:01.15]No, I don't.
[226:01.59]I need, like, a health cure.
[226:07.35]Only kids will remember that.
[226:10.25]Because it doesn't matter how old you are, Pez still exists.
[226:24.01]Okay.
[226:26.01]Let's go.
[226:36.66]Interesting little swamp right here.
[226:41.89]Those water physics.
[226:44.21]Beautiful stuff.
[226:46.43]What's that?
[226:51.04]What's in the witch's hut?
[227:07.47]Let's do it.
[227:08.57]Put some bait on here.
[227:16.99]What are you doing?
[227:17.87]That's not a fish.
[227:23.16]It's a snake.
[227:31.38]I need to study that, though.
[227:34.06]Steady.
[227:35.08]Steady.
[227:37.38]Just put the gun away so I can study this.
[227:39.65]Just come here.
[227:45.30]Why can I not study?
[227:46.32]I don't know what it is.
[228:05.83]That is a Midland water snake.
[228:09.02]Yields of skin and stringy meat.
[228:10.84]Used in crafting cooking.
[228:11.60]Could be sold.
[228:12.22]Okay.
[228:16.22]Oh, Jesus.
[228:21.52]American alligator.
[228:23.86]Yields of skin, teeth, and big game meat.
[228:27.32]Use a bow with improved arrows.
[228:28.82]A long scope rifle for a clean kill.
[228:36.71]Uh, come here, horse.
[228:38.03]In the head?
[229:16.57]What's the correct place to shoot an alligator?
[229:25.21]I turned him into a rug.
[229:26.97]Okay.
[229:30.70]How's he gonna go fishing here?
[229:48.90]Well, I got him.
[229:50.68]He's just a little one.
[229:52.65]He was really small.
[229:57.01]He looked a lot bigger in the sculpt.
[230:10.78]This is bad.
[230:11.54]That's poor alligator skin.
[230:18.50]Alright, let's go fishing.
[230:24.14]There's a fish right here.
[230:25.14]Okay.
[230:28.12]Bait.
[230:30.21]Uh... Where are we?
[230:30.85]Attracts small fish, which is, uh... Red bait.
[230:35.29]Lake lure.
[230:35.75]Attracts all medium and large-sized lake fish.
[230:40.21]Corn.
[230:41.56]I mean, that's all I have.
[230:54.07]I would appreciate it if you didn't keep throwing it away.
[230:56.61]Okay.
[230:56.73]Okay.
[230:56.91]Give me something good.
[231:12.74]Throw a dynamite in the water.
[231:13.98]No, it's gonna be high quality.
[231:24.79]Easy.
[231:29.75]I got an alligator.
[231:42.61]Just fish with your hands.
[231:43.63]I don't think it works like that.
[231:45.63]And it is...
[231:53.53]Four pounds, one ounce, largemouth bass.
[231:56.69]Try a different spot.
[232:01.89]How about over here?
[232:03.45]Come on.
[232:10.70]Right in that spot.
[232:11.34]I see little bubbles.
[232:12.06]Come on.
[232:30.87]Come on.
[232:41.81]I can't cast in water that deep.
[232:48.59]Really?
[232:54.38]Right into the trees.
[233:03.19]Tree snaggin' coming.
[233:04.37]It's gonna pull me up there.
[233:11.55]After I get one more fish, I'm gonna grab a snack.
[233:16.64]See what I got downstairs.
[233:19.54]Maybe I'll have some soup.
[233:26.02]No tree joke?
[233:27.86]Sorry.
[233:42.42]Where are all the fish in this dirty water?
[233:43.88]I'm gonna put cheese on it.
[234:17.21]Get the cheese on there.
[234:29.62]Have I got to change your underwear?
[235:32.81]It didn't work!
[235:34.77]What?
[235:37.63]Whoa, wait!
[235:43.92]Where did this alligator come?
[235:45.66]Huh?
[235:56.65]The dynamite killed an alligator at the bottom and turned it into bundled up skin.
[236:05.72]Alright.
[236:13.94]Okay, let's go.
[236:14.84]I'm, like, standing in muck.
[236:22.05]I'm gonna check out the witch's house.
[236:29.15]This place looks pretty menacing.
[236:36.36]Anyone here?
[236:36.86]Abandoned?
[236:38.93]Abandoned?
[236:41.03]I guess.
[236:41.95]Unless they're not here.
[236:52.14]Cigarette card.
[236:57.10]President Alfred McAllister.
[237:04.31]What is this?
[237:06.22]Vegetables.
[237:09.90]What has he got?
[237:11.34]How about a lockbox?
[237:13.50]Cash.
[237:14.44]Money.
[237:20.10]Gun oil.
[237:28.42]Hair tonic.
[237:33.37]Let's sit over there.
[237:37.81]Uh, can I open up the cabinet?
[237:40.47]I can.
[237:43.55]Crackers!
[237:49.00]Opened chewing tobacco.
[237:50.44]I don't think I want that.
[237:59.22]Interesting little hot fishing rod.
[238:01.04]New fishing rod?
[238:01.60]Are there different fishing rods?
[238:06.30]No.
[238:08.49]Ooh.
[238:19.11]Okay, now there's no cutscene going on.
[238:21.07]Can the horse get in the boat?
[238:22.73]You know what I mean?
[238:26.21]No cutscene.
[238:28.09]No bullshit.
[238:32.55]I'm gonna jump from the dock.
[238:35.53]Yep, yep.
[238:55.20]Probably not.
[239:02.99]Try it one more time.
[239:09.43]Just two moves too much.
[239:16.87]No.
[239:20.53]Last ditch attempt, right?
[239:24.89]What is that?
[239:31.24]Dammit.
[239:32.04]Oh well.
[239:34.66]I had it as an attack.
[239:57.33]It's not homing dynamite.
[239:58.37]Yeah, back to what we were doing.
[240:03.76]Maybe I do wanna... I'm gonna take a boat there.
[240:05.22]I'm just gonna go over this way.
[240:13.70]See what we can find.
[240:31.43]Are these big boats?
[240:33.04]Whoa, what do we have here?
[240:34.90]I think I sense the score over here.
[241:00.56]It's just me out here right now.
[241:03.40]The horse is following you?
[241:28.71]What are you doing?
[241:33.35]Get out of here!
[241:35.21]Go home!
[241:36.62]Why are you coming out here?
[241:40.08]Hey, leave!
[241:43.14]Not safe!
[241:58.61]Alright, good boy.
[242:14.17]I'm gonna take like some cores.
[242:16.61]Some lightning cores.
[242:22.60]That's the horse!
[242:23.90]That's the horse!
[242:40.28]Relax.
[242:40.96]Stay there.
[242:51.43]I'm not calling the horse out here.
[242:52.81]I thought that was my core for a second.
[243:01.37]Alright, he's fine.
[243:13.22]What is going on here?
[243:16.48]What's happening?
[243:20.19]Why did I just drown?
[243:28.50]Why did I just drown?
[243:29.52]I fa- Did I- Did I seriously just get, like, Battlefield Ford?
[243:41.65]I went out too far?
[243:45.57]Out of the map?
[243:56.28]Whatever.
[243:56.72]Hold on.
[244:08.65]Oh, what a nightmare.
[244:15.08]And right back in.
[244:16.74]Right back into the water.
[244:23.60]I can think I'm dead again.
[244:24.70]I can climb.
[244:27.36]I can climb and I can kick.
[244:32.10]We're fine.
[244:32.68]Let's take a break.
[245:05.11]Okay.
[245:14.18]Okay.
[245:15.58]So how do I get from here to there?
[245:17.82]There's a ladder.
[245:21.98]Set up camp in somebody's boat.
[245:33.29]Aww.
[245:40.83]Oh well.
[245:48.56]What the fuck?
[245:51.86]I think I just broke my chair.
[246:07.75]Actually, let me cook some shit.
[246:08.96]Yeah, you guys are right.
[246:11.42]You guys are right.
[246:14.70]You guys are right.
[246:18.23]Plain freaky fish.
[246:23.31]Looks good.
[246:37.51]Throwing the used alcohol bottle into the fire.
[246:40.17]Just asking to get, like, a problem.
[246:46.91]I'll store this next one.
[246:47.91]Got some shoes on.
[246:50.99]Don't tell me what kind of clothes to wear.
[246:53.95]How dare you make fun of my wilderness man.
[247:02.61]Playing big game.
[247:04.95]Playing mutton.
[247:15.42]Although, this is good, because I'll have this for later.
[247:23.13]You know, if it ever gets dire, I could cook the hat.
[247:25.91]Right?
[247:34.95]No.
[247:36.03]Why not?
[247:37.23]I mean, I'll give worms, but I'll still be able to eat it.
[247:53.02]Alright, that's good.
[247:56.30]I'll cook the rest later.
[248:01.22]Now, we... I'm gonna sleep.
[248:08.60]Who cares?
[248:10.56]Sleep until morning.
[248:15.68]There's lots of nutrients in leather.
[248:19.05]But you get the snout.
[248:21.76]You just burn the snout and just... You'll crunch right through it.
[248:27.18]It'll be like chewing on cigarette ashes, but it'll be enough.
[248:29.62]Imagine the mosquitoes.
[248:42.21]Oh, I don't even want to imagine.
[248:43.59]What?
[248:44.01]What?
[248:44.35]Wait, wait, wait.
[248:45.37]Where am I?
[248:49.26]All the way down here.
[248:50.88]This is a huge place.
[248:57.96]Okay.
[248:59.08]Well.
[249:02.33]Barber, tailor.
[249:03.37]There's a lot here.
[249:12.04]Alright, let me, this is a lot going on.
[249:14.68]I'm going to take one more break.
[249:16.34]I'm going to grab some soup.
[249:20.49]Because I want to sip on some soup because I'm a little hungry.
[249:22.39]And I will see you guys.
[249:23.49]I just saw him eat, so I know I have to.
[249:24.91]See you guys in like two minutes.
[253:18.47]Okay, I got some soup in a cup here.
[253:23.51]Ready to rock and roll.
[253:30.11]Let me just turn this back on.
[253:33.77]Okay, so this is a new town.
[253:42.73]What's the soup?
[253:44.99]Nobody asked that, but I don't know.
[253:48.25]Might as well tell everybody we're meeting.
[253:59.98]Snake!
[254:11.08]What?
[254:12.27]Did I just run into it?
[254:14.87]Oh, I did!
[254:16.75]I just bumped into him.
[254:21.18]Why does he sound like a T-Rex?
[254:53.92]I'm gonna choke.
[254:56.62]I don't think gaming... I think gaming might not be your thing.
[255:02.45]I mean, to be fair, I did try to stomp on an alligator's head with bare feet.
[255:16.12]I needed to see what was gonna happen.
[255:20.74]I needed to see what was gonna happen.
[255:23.91]Now, so, here's the deal.
[255:27.09]Go to this big town, or, no, the thing that I'm supposed to do, the thing that I've been trying to do, there's another town over there, we'll find it later.
[255:38.38]He picks me up like a dog toy.
[255:57.63]Show soup or no balls.
[256:01.18]What?
[256:08.04]It's like a bean and kale minestrone or something.
[256:21.32]I don't know.
[256:25.12]Oh.
[256:26.00]Oh, Jesus.
[256:28.78]That's how you make an entrance Where'd that guy go?
[257:04.56]Ran up here somewhere.
[257:11.11]Where'd he go?
[257:13.33]Wait, those are the good guys?
[257:20.20]I thought those were the bad guys.
[257:43.89]You don't look quite right.
[257:46.03]Someone just broke the soup.
[257:50.33]That was more important.
[257:53.19]This is more important.
[257:56.26]There.
[257:56.56]There you go.
[257:57.86]There's the soup.
[258:01.34]There.
[258:01.58]It's in there.
[258:02.20]I know it looks like coffee grounds and fucking cigarette ashes, but I promise.
[258:10.11]Ugh.
[258:16.11]Put him in the coffin.
[258:17.29]Time's up.
[258:20.85]Mm-hmm.
[258:20.99]Well, go get it.
[258:45.58]Come with me to the churchyard.
[258:47.66]We're about to dig somebody up.
[258:48.72]Stay close.
[258:51.64]Alright.
[258:54.43]Do I not want a bowl?
[258:55.67]This ain't right.
[258:57.21]I mean, I'll get you your money, but... You want me to be a bowl of soup with a spoon while I'm trying to play a game?
[259:04.39]You can't pay back.
[259:06.62]I guess you're correct, but... I can just sip it.
[259:10.68]It ain't exactly right, what we're doing.
[259:14.84]I'm like screaming.
[259:15.62]I'm playing a game.
[259:16.46]Is it homemade?
[259:16.82]No, it's not.
[259:17.30]Came out of a fucking bag.
[259:57.75]We actually are about to do this, though.
[259:59.43]The insane part about that.
[260:03.85]Wow.
[260:27.52]Oh, damn it.
[260:29.75]These have all been so different.
[260:30.53]There's a bunch of people here.
[260:32.97]Oh, I got it.
[260:33.73]I got it.
[260:34.09]Look, you clear them off, and I'll wait right around here.
[260:37.44]Clear them off.
[260:38.26]But don't hurt nobody.
[260:39.38]Don't hurt... Hey, watch it.
[260:41.17]Okay, clear all the townsfolk.
[260:44.32]Don't be shy.
[260:45.24]Ain't no one around.
[260:46.60]Just my auntie.
[260:47.98]Your auntie's long past prudishness.
[260:51.46]It's disrespectful.
[260:53.02]You'd rather disrespect the live and breathing woman you got here in front of you.
[260:57.53]Get out of here, kids.
[260:59.03]Move.
[260:59.77]Come on.
[261:00.55]I knew we shouldn't have been here.
[261:01.79]You missed your chance, boy.
[261:05.40]Get out of here, kids.
[261:12.94]Get down here!
[261:14.06]Move!
[261:45.20]For the love of God.
[262:09.55]This is not good for my health, man.
[262:11.35]Playing a Rockstar game... Honestly, it's the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes every time you play.
[262:17.33]No, I gotta stop people from coming in here?
[262:44.09]Laughter's good for you?
[262:45.07]I know, but I feel drained after every one of these scenes.
[262:54.13]This lady's trying to come in here.
[262:56.71]Oh, that's the lady that was just here.
[263:02.48]Excuse me.
[263:05.06]I'm sorry, ma'am.
[263:06.16]The church grounds are closed for maintenance work.
[263:10.89]Well, it's about time, too.
[263:13.81]The place was in need of some care and attention.
[263:15.67]Do they come from more than one angle?
[263:29.92]Or just right at the front door?
[263:30.80]That's the only way you can really get in.
[263:36.79]Here they come.
[263:40.96]Alright, charm.
[263:44.72]Charm, antagonize, antagonize.
[263:46.42]Get the hell out of this churchyard.
[263:54.24]Are you boys going to need yourselves a preacher?
[263:57.02]You hear this fella?
[263:58.42]I heard him, alright.
[264:00.10]We're going to lick you, bastard.
[264:23.05]Get out of here.
[264:24.35]I thought I'm not supposed to hurt anybody.
[264:28.76]Let him go.
[264:29.10]Let him go.
[264:29.42]Let him go.
[264:29.90]Let him go.
[264:30.82]Let him go.
[264:31.24]I hope this holds Doug.
[264:56.49]How you doing?
[264:57.72]Alright, well, here's your payment.
[265:00.46]Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Claypole.
[265:02.78]What'd you find?
[265:04.34]She had a brooch here.
[265:05.74]Looks like diamonds.
[265:06.98]Diamond?
[265:08.95]Diamond?
[265:13.53]Well, this'll do.
[265:16.41]Now get out of here before someone sees you.
[265:20.27]Holy shit.
[265:20.53]I can't believe it's come to this.
[265:23.76]Alright, well, uh,
[265:25.08]How do we, like, put this back?
[265:26.08]Can we put this back?
[265:39.32]Guys... Guys, I... I can't throw dynamite in the hole.
[265:48.40]Do you understand?
[265:49.94]It's not even possible, so s-s-leave it be.
[266:10.57]Alright.
[266:11.61]Get recovered.
[266:13.15]I wonder what a diamond Bruce is worth.
[266:16.86]I can't do it.
[266:21.80]See?
[266:24.68]You can't use weapons.
[266:40.31]See?
[266:44.77]Bypass it.
[266:46.89]How?
[266:59.32]I can't do a Hail Mary toss.
[267:00.70]I'm still in town.
[267:07.82]I need to go back to my camp here.
[267:11.21]You know what I mean?
[267:13.45]Oh, I can't.
[267:13.99]Look at... There's a random stranger here.
[267:19.46]Defense?
[267:21.22]No, he's right here.
[267:21.82]Do I have anything to sell?
[267:24.02]I need to bring that diamond thing back to the camp, so I can't really sell it reliably.
[267:40.03]Oh, well.
[267:45.63]I didn't even touch him.
[267:47.53]I didn't even touch him.
[267:48.26]I walked right... I am ready and waiting.
[268:15.22]Well, I got him.
[268:15.80]There he is.
[268:16.24]What we got?
[268:16.66]A large bag of jewelry.
[268:23.38]Mm-hmm.
[268:23.54]Three bucks each, that's it.
[268:49.01]Wedding ring, can't be sold for cash.
[268:54.47]Just earrings.
[268:57.95]Ah!
[268:58.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[268:59.29]Give them back.
[268:59.70]Give them back.
[269:00.10]How do I get?
[269:00.74]Give them back.
[269:01.12]Give them back.
[269:02.70]Give them back.
[269:07.46]Fuck.
[269:09.42]I can use these somewhere.
[269:12.94]God damn it.
[269:16.33]Is there a buyback?
[269:20.84]Shit.
[269:21.14]That's not... I can use those, I just didn't mean to do that.
[269:29.63]You only need one anyways?
[269:34.75]Okay, well that's fine.
[270:06.18]It's too far.
[270:14.67]Maybe not.
[270:20.99]Hold on.
[270:21.67]Nope.
[270:36.17]What are you doing?
[270:41.29]I'm trying to double heal stuff, the guy lying on the ground.
[270:48.82]I guess I could do this, stranger, but no, I need to do this.
[270:52.32]Back to camp.
[270:55.02]Back to camp.
[270:55.94]I'm gonna give the provisions back.
[270:58.24]And, never mind.
[271:04.39]Spoke too soon.
[271:08.83]If anyone moves, I ain't going to blink before I shoot you.
[271:11.87]Hurry up in there.
[271:12.35]Get out of here before the cavalry comes.
[271:15.39]Wagon's loaded.
[271:16.25]Let's move out.
[271:20.40]If anyone comes after us, they'll be met with a short and nasty end.
[271:26.92]I can't jump on the train.
[271:27.96]Don't wear it.
[271:29.14]Don't.
[271:31.58]Ah.
[271:32.26]The Lemoyne Raiders is a multitude.
[271:35.80]Dude, believe us.
[271:37.48]We in.
[272:04.18]Are we alright?
[272:04.74]I can take this.
[272:20.19]I can sell this to a fence.
[272:23.44]But wait.
[272:25.70]Where about the train?
[272:28.78]Don't get stuck in the box again.
[272:29.98]I know, seriously.
[272:32.22]I'll do everything possible to not have that happen.
[272:36.33]So that's still there.
[272:40.03]What am I doing?
[272:40.53]I can drive the train?
[272:48.71]You can drive the train?
[273:06.78]My horse!
[273:07.50]Stay!
[273:08.14]Get out of here!
[273:15.43]This guy's waiting for the train.
[273:40.27]Can I pick up passengers?
[273:41.57]It's steaming, this guy.
[274:15.97]I caught some reprobate shambling around my backyard yesterday.
[274:21.97]OK.
[274:22.45]OK, bye.
[274:23.09]That was fun.
[274:37.47]What's the purpose of this?
[274:38.53]Am I first person to train?
[274:42.39]I can.
[274:42.69]I feel like it matters.
[274:50.30]My poor horse!
[275:13.66]Check the map.
[275:20.56]So we're... It all takes us back to the city.
[275:25.18]I guess.
[275:29.10]Of course it's fine.
[275:42.52]Okay, what if I get dropped?
[275:44.52]What if somebody tries to stop this train?
[275:58.95]How would they stop this?
[275:59.91]They wouldn't.
[276:04.57]There's a pig.
[276:09.43]Just keep going around in a circle.
[276:12.29]Just don't stop.
[276:21.22]I can't go faster.
[276:22.20]It's as fast as I can go.
[276:31.60]What about other trains?
[276:36.13]Can I back up into another train?
[276:40.51]What's happening over there?
[276:42.94]Oh, it's an alligator.
[276:43.52]There's a legendary fish over here.
[276:57.30]Couldn't go that way.

[278:45.08]You know, I can't go this far into this populated city and not just run a person over.

[287:40.00]See him down there?
[287:48.67]I think I ran a guy over.
[287:55.52]Yeah, I did.
[288:40.75]Lucky bastard!
[288:50.39]I'm bleeding.
[288:55.65]I just hit a seagull.
[289:03.13]I hit a seagull.
[289:03.81]Alright, this is the last ride.
[289:08.41]I'm just going to scrape through.
[289:16.33]I need to do this right, though.
[289:19.57]I gotta do this right.
[289:21.57]I'm gonna wait till I'm not a wanted man anymore.
[289:23.69]I have to run over a carriage.
[289:25.19]I have to.
[289:26.41]I can't have this fucking god powers without ramming into a carriage.
[289:32.66]We're about to lose our wanted level here.
[289:37.62]Okay.
[289:40.72]Nice new carriage comeback.
[289:43.96]With my fucking Satan powers that I have right here.
[289:54.02]Why would you do that?
[289:54.88]Get out of the way!
[289:58.90]I don't want to hit you.
[290:00.00]I want to run over a carriage.
[290:07.46]Carriage coming.
[290:09.76]Here it is, boys and girls.
[290:11.56]This is what you all waited for.
[290:18.50]Here comes a cross.
[290:21.10]Here we come.
[290:22.36]Come across.
[290:24.84]Incoming.
[290:26.80]Incoming.
[290:28.60]Cross over there.
[290:30.48]Right across there.
[290:37.51]Cross.
[290:39.35]Cross somewhere.
[290:40.57]I'll follow you to you.
[290:41.29]Cross.
[290:58.38]Are they gonna go left?
[290:58.98]Fuck.
[291:09.31]Where does it cross?
[291:17.65]Does anybody cross here with a carriage?
[291:23.92]I'll put my- You know what?
[291:25.20]Fuck it.
[291:28.30]You think I give a shift?
[291:30.54]I'm getting out of my turtle shell here for a second.
[291:54.20]Nobody touch this.
[292:01.74]I need a carriage.
[292:03.46]I need two carriages.
[292:07.03]That's not big enough.
[292:07.73]That one.
[292:10.37]Like a huge one.
[292:11.01]I'm going to line up three of them.
[292:18.76]I need to be his fault.
[292:22.74]I can't move you.
[292:23.40]I can't make you go the other way.
[292:31.14]That one's not big enough.
[292:31.84]I need... There, here we go.
[292:33.85]Wait a second.
[292:35.75]Hello there.
[292:36.45]Okay, I'm gonna need that wagon.
[292:38.67]That ain't right what you're doing.
[293:06.20]This thing is fast!
[293:07.40]I need that, get out of that.
[293:28.95]Oh fuck, he hit it in the head.
[293:35.26]What?
[293:35.51]Where did this go?
[293:40.91]The horse ran away.
[293:42.99]Of course.
[293:43.63]The horse.
[293:49.92]Get in the train.
[293:51.06]Come on, get back in the turtle shell.
[293:52.84]The horses are fucking running away with them.
[293:55.16]Drive it.
[293:56.26]Quick, before they get on.
[294:23.56]I wish I could reach out and punch.
[294:28.70]No, I'm getting out of here.
[294:32.75]That guy though.
[294:33.59]A lot of people just died.
[294:35.29]I'm dragging this guy.
[294:36.91]That guy's stuck on the train.
[294:39.19]I think he's stuck on it still.
[294:41.75]Is he still on it?
[294:46.43]I won't miss this train?
[294:47.53]Is that what this lady's saying?
[294:53.02]I gotta- I gotta get to a park crossing.
[295:00.08]Are there passages on the train?
[295:04.63]There are no passages on the train.
[295:14.79]Okay, now we just gotta get to a place where the carriages come through.
[295:21.34]Because I'm going to run over every single one.
[295:40.70]Where are we now?
[295:45.92]How could they possibly lose you?
[295:47.70]Because they don't understand that I'm in the train.
[295:50.99]So I'm technically undercover.
[295:52.27]I'm just going to get to a crossroad.
[296:04.69]Wherever that may be.
[296:05.31]You can get really over the top.
[296:14.96]You're going the wrong way.
[296:17.62]Alright.
[296:17.84]So we're good to go.
[296:21.24]Now we just have to get across.
[296:25.53]Crosswalk.
[296:29.79]I've definitely seen at least one or two of them, right?
[296:45.57]Which way does it go?
[296:46.23]Can I direct which way it goes?
[296:47.27]I don't think I can.
[296:51.91]But is that track for another train?
[297:01.36]Somebody's telling me if I'm wrong here, but can I crash into the other train?
[297:16.16]Is that just not going to happen?
[297:23.10]Oh, we're going way up in the wilderness here unless we're going to be able to make it.
[297:27.94]Oh, we're going all the way up.
[297:29.66]All the way.
[297:30.09]We're going deep.
[297:31.99]We'll be on here for a while.
[297:48.70]Trainball, you up!
[297:50.86]Not down.
[297:51.54]Oh, God.
[298:17.91]Damn it.
[298:18.51]I'm stopping a train!
[298:27.03]That was a little too late.
[298:38.58]Wait.
[298:52.84]I might as well loot them.
[298:56.96]Bullet.
[298:57.22]Yeah, I didn't want to scare them.
[298:58.73]I just... I was getting off of a train and it was too late.
[299:02.33]What'd you have?
[299:11.48]What were you going to give me for doing this?
[299:12.98]A tonic.
[299:19.08]What about you?
[299:23.93]I think I didn't have anything.
[299:41.92]Yeah, somebody is guessing the thing that I'm doing.
[299:45.98]This is the fucking death train at now, guys.
[299:51.44]We're filling this train with passengers.
[300:02.97]No amount of blood and death will be able to suffice this train.
[300:08.90]I'm gonna fill it until there's no more room.
[300:13.86]Like it's a storage house.
[300:15.38]Like one of those storage units.
[300:27.73]I wonder if I dedicate myself to this.
[300:30.35]If I can fill this with people.
[300:50.89]It's worth a shot.
[300:53.85]And we have derailed at this point.
[300:55.81]We have.
[300:56.05]I'm gonna crash the PS4.
[301:01.25]So be it.
[301:06.85]Just hunt a bunch of animals, but a bunch of animals and people.
[301:11.62]This is just like the Angel of Death, like Satan's Express.
[301:16.10]I'm going to fill this with fucking elks and bears and people.
[301:20.64]Noah's Ark.
[301:23.59]We're just going to drive the train around and pick up the unsuspecting bastards.
[301:36.22]No, don't die.
[301:36.94]Don't become one of them.
[301:39.00]Oh, shit.
[301:42.85]Hey, see you guys in like 4 hours when there's 200 people on the train.
[301:49.06]I'm gonna come to like a stop, and they're all gonna go flying out.
[301:54.12]It's going to be a disaster.
[302:08.58]Because they can't stop me.
[302:10.26]You know what I'm saying?
[302:11.72]I cannot be stopped.
[302:13.34]The only way that I can be stopped here is if these people despawn.
[302:18.32]We'll find out.
[302:26.49]No, they're still in there.
[302:31.41]They still in there?
[302:33.62]That's a go, baby.
[302:35.84]Welcome to the stream.
[302:36.54]I wanna see if I can put 100 people in here.
[302:41.10]Make sure it's safe.
[302:54.57]Yeah, I'm gonna make one slot specific for this.
[303:01.48]Because this is the... Let me just get this straight.
[303:07.18]This is the one that was just the actual video game, right?
[303:20.53]Because whatever this one is, what is it going to be called?
[303:25.24]Because I want to make sure I can go back to the actual game after this nonsense.
[303:29.00]Here's the problem.
[303:29.58]Let's make sure it didn't fuck up.
[303:34.16]They still here?
[303:34.62]Oh yeah, they're still here.
[303:41.81]You see animals?
[303:44.39]People?
[304:02.46]Use your horse?
[304:03.46]Somewhere.
[304:04.08]It'll be fine.
[304:06.98]Alright, anybody up there?
[304:08.40]Any humans up there?
[304:09.06]Remember, anyone is welcome.
[304:18.57]Oh, yeah.
[304:19.15]Hey!
[304:19.67]We got another passenger!
[304:22.35]You know what I mean?
[304:23.11]When you see a new passenger... Oh, we've got quite a few passengers here, don't we?
[304:38.00]How many?
[304:40.72]Hmm.
[304:56.68]I'm going to go too far.
[304:57.44]Because they might despawn if I go too far.
[305:03.92]Now that I think about that.
[305:08.17]Let's find out.
[305:09.95]Train's still there?
[305:10.56]Mm-hmm.
[305:13.78]Can't tell if it's still in there, though.
[305:19.33]Did you?
[305:47.63]Don't worry, I'll take care of it after.
[305:50.54]They're still on the train.
[305:52.10]I'm gonna lead them back here.
[305:55.78]I wish I had a bit of guns.
[306:25.90]How many bodies we got here?
[306:36.07]Okay, quick, quick, quickly, quickly!
[307:58.87]Here's the thing though, I can't die.
[308:00.87]I gotta be very, very aware of my health.
[308:13.37]If I die, the whole thing is over.
[308:37.64]The train.
[308:38.46]It hungers.
[308:42.00]Just, I'm gonna save after every major, uh, soul gathering.
[308:51.45]One body pre- Well, we can deal with logistics later.
[308:54.61]You understand?
[308:56.49]He dead.
[309:09.67]We can set them up later.
[309:11.71]Just gotta get enough people in it.
[309:21.04]One person per seat.
[309:23.60]One person and one animal per seat.
[309:42.91]What time is it?
[309:44.67]Like 11 o'clock Eastern?
[309:47.56]Alright, I'm gonna give this until... But, okay, Siri, remind me in 20 minutes what my progress is on the soul train.
[309:56.50]Like the ghost train.
[310:30.46]I'll sit here and feed it all day.
[310:38.53]It auto-aimed the horse's head.
[310:40.11]I didn't do that.
[310:41.73]Ooh, that hurts.
[310:43.57]What was that?
[310:44.88]Fuck.
[311:07.28]If only I had my other weapons.
[311:27.31]If only I didn't run my fucking horse over.
[311:31.03]Actually, this is pretty good.
[311:31.83]I'm okay with this.
[311:41.81]Take their weapons?
[311:43.11]Why did I not even think about that?
[312:15.83]We're gonna have a lot of bodies to loot, that's for sure.
[312:17.37]Well, we're gonna test the power of the PlayStation 4.
[312:23.69]Can they follow the windows?
[312:24.55]I don't think so.
[312:26.19]Now, I need to get some big, bulky animals in there.
[312:37.80]I'm talking big elk, deer, alligators.
[312:42.56]It's just Noah's Ark.
[312:45.36]Yeah, I'm not gonna cause any more trouble here.
[312:47.06]I'm gonna save and I'm gonna take off.
[312:49.37]Like, from this place.
[313:06.16]Can you pick up the big animals?
[313:07.92]Not bears and everything.
[313:14.66]Yeah, I'm sorry for the next at least 30 minutes of this stream.
[313:19.70]I kind of have to do this, though.
[313:21.48]It's the only opportunity I'm ever gonna have.
[313:22.82]Oh, I just stepped on somebody's head.
[313:36.34]I heard somebody over here.
[313:44.86]Like turkeys.
[313:45.56]These people are investigating.
[313:54.61]Oh, it's gotta go in there.
[313:58.97]Did you hear that?
[314:02.95]Holy shit!
[314:07.75]You're lucky.
[314:09.89]You're lucky.
[314:18.80]We gotta move on from this stop.
[314:26.68]I do wanna go- I do have to pick up a gun though, that's right.
[314:29.75]Somebody's getting up.
[314:37.01]We're attracting- Once you get on, you're not allowed to get off!
[315:03.77]He knew what he signed up for.
[315:04.81]I'm gonna attract so many- Bears are gonna come in here.
[315:19.94]Animals are gonna come over here.
[315:21.22]This is gonna be fucking so ridiculous.
[315:24.14]If they stay here, I don't even need to go hunting.
[315:28.43]There's gonna be animals in here every single- every five minutes.
[315:31.93]There's gonna be a bear will come in here.
[315:39.98]There's gonna be so many predators.
[315:44.34]I'm gonna get, like, eaten by a bear in the train.
[315:47.86]Mark my words.
[315:50.66]Alright, we gotta get out of here.
[315:52.43]One more guy down there and that's it.
[315:53.59]We gotta move.
[315:58.55]What happened to the old terminal?
[315:59.73]You know, the guy that used to run into people and laugh and scream?
[316:06.02]You sure you wanted that?
[316:09.82]Be careful what you wish for.
[316:10.80]You know, you just might get it.
[316:22.69]More food for the fucking train.
[316:41.97]Dude, that guy knows what's up.
[316:47.99]That guy doesn't have to become food.
[316:55.08]Well, maybe he does.
[316:57.28]Maybe he does.
[317:03.56]Wait, whose dog is this?
[317:05.74]Why is there a dog in here?
[317:07.89]Hey, what are you in here?
[317:11.34]Get out of here.
[317:12.86]Technically, he's not in the train.
[317:15.02]He's not in the train yet.
[317:17.52]Get out of here.
[317:18.96]You need to get out of here.
[317:21.52]Don't step in this train.
[317:24.88]Out.
[317:26.70]Don't go in there.
[317:28.42]Don't go in there.
[317:29.97]I'm going to tell you, you're not going to want to be in there.
[317:37.23]What the f- How did you get in?
[317:39.19]I don't- Perfect!
[317:40.23]I don't even need to pick him up!
[317:43.59]Get out of here!
[317:51.21]It's a f- Oh, it's a fox!
[317:58.16]Well... Well, what have- What?
[318:03.44]That's everybody, right?
[318:04.85]Yep.
[318:05.85]Okay.
[318:07.35]Time to leave the station.
[318:23.16]Is Fox still there?
[318:28.58]Hey.
[318:30.56]Get.
[318:32.92]Get.
[318:44.47]Excuse me.
[318:45.03]This is not gonna end well for you, man.
[318:54.53]Is he just gonna ride with me?
[318:57.79]Okay.
[318:58.09]He's not gonna fall off, I guess.
[319:14.65]He's just hanging out.
[319:17.91]I'm so concerned about him though.
[319:23.47]Well.
[319:30.45]Is he gone?
[319:31.55]Wait, wait, where is he?
[319:32.11]Where is he?
[319:32.43]Is he gone?
[319:36.90]No, he's still there.
[319:42.24]Come to the next town.
[319:45.30]There's a witness investigating me.
[319:49.46]Really not.
[319:51.80]And where would that be?
[319:55.40]Save the game.
[319:55.97]Uh-huh.
[320:02.47]I can't.
[320:05.33]Here's the problem with this.
[320:06.35]I'll give you one issue.
[320:10.64]With a game save, it doesn't matter.
[320:14.19]It's gonna put me leaning up against a tree somewhere.
[320:21.91]You all know it.
[320:30.75]Am I getting followed by vultures?
[320:41.38]Who?
[320:44.27]You've survived that.
[320:56.96]Really.
[321:17.13]Fucking bullshit.
[321:21.89]I gotta go.
[321:27.21]Mr. Fox!
[321:28.79]Full speed ahead!
[321:29.69]Are the passengers still in there?
[321:51.98]Why is this guy trying to keep up with me?
[322:06.01]You cannot stop death.
[322:16.13]I can't feel the train here, man.
[322:17.50]It's too dangerous.
[322:21.32]I just gotta get out of here.
[322:22.20]Is somebody on the train right now?
[322:27.42]Why did I hear glass breaking?
[322:28.56]There's so many police!
[322:35.76]They're just running into the train!
[322:38.28]They're sprinting into the train!
[322:41.03]They've lost all control!
[322:52.24]Holy shit!
[322:54.02]Oh my god!
[322:58.30]It calls to them!
[323:01.67]Almost home, Scott.
[323:02.31]And then we get up and just pick the blind spot.
[323:06.99]Because we've got a train to beat.
[323:18.66]Now they're freaking out.
[323:19.90]Now I just became a train.
[323:22.02]Nothing else.
[323:22.40]I don't have to move.
[323:29.70]I'm a train.
[323:32.97]Officer, good evening.
[323:36.03]Whoa!
[323:36.43]Hey!
[323:39.53]There's another train!
[323:41.03]There's another train!
[323:42.47]There's a train!
[323:44.33]Oh no!
[323:46.02]I can't go!
[323:46.64]I'm gonna die!
[323:49.25]I can't move!
[323:50.87]Oh, it's over!
[323:52.01]It's over!
[323:52.51]I need to work this fucking hard to have this happen.
[324:24.78]Two trains?!
[324:26.12]Two trains!
[324:30.40]I can't move!
[324:31.36]This train won't move now!
[324:37.22]There we go.
[324:52.26]Get the bodies.
[324:52.86]I can't stick around there, man.
[324:54.78]I gotta get out.
[324:55.32]I gotta get away.
[324:57.32]There's a whole nother train of people over there.
[324:59.86]I'm just gonna transfer them to this one.
[325:30.51]You still there?
[325:30.97]Hey buddy.
[325:32.05]Alright, how my core is doing?
[325:37.41]I'm like running out of food.
[325:42.79]Did you hear the flies?
[325:50.41]So yeah, we're just gonna transfer- this is the transfer station.
[326:00.45]Are there people in here?
[326:43.18]Okay The conductor and put him in I'm gonna put him in the engine room Oh
[327:03.28]The fox just defended his territory.
[327:05.76]They're reproducing.
[327:16.73]No, they're not.
[327:19.71]I'm gonna put him in the conductor's seat with me.
[327:22.89]Can I even get him up there?
[327:25.19]I can't.
[327:31.80]Well, well.
[327:34.09]Look at these flags.
[327:35.09]He's defending.
[327:35.91]I love the fact that this is his house now.
[327:38.63]A raccoon came over and he's like, get out of here.
[327:40.71]This is my train.
[327:45.46]I could study him again.
[327:46.40]Are there a bunch of passengers on here though?
[327:52.84]For real?
[327:58.92]There has to be, right?
[328:01.82]Somebody would be taking the train.
[328:06.76]Is it nobody on here?
[328:11.59]I don't think I can...
[328:35.81]What the hell is this guy doing here?
[328:51.92]He's guarding the train.
[328:54.37]Well... Sorry, man.
[328:57.69]I don't think you guard a train from the boiler room.
[329:20.82]Go get the engineer's hat.
[329:29.84]There's another fox.
[329:34.24]He's... He can't move.
[329:37.52]His head is stuck.
[329:39.12]I gotta help him.
[329:40.02]How do I help him?
[329:40.58]How do I get him out of there?
[329:42.30]Oh, shit.
[329:44.50]Is he... Okay.
[329:48.12]I think...
[329:50.71]Free him?
[329:51.21]I don't know where he is.
[329:53.85]Which one is he under?
[329:54.49]Oh, they're going through the train.
[330:07.60]They're going through the train now.
[330:11.56]Shit.
[330:11.90]I think they're actually falling through the train when I pick them up like that.
[330:19.69]The corpses are just rotting out.
[330:24.33]I gotta be quick.
[330:30.58]Body's decomposing.
[330:36.30]I, I don't, maybe not.
[330:41.98]I think it's because I picked him up and put him back down.
[330:43.52]Alright, hey, I need you to get out of the way.
[330:50.10]I gotta get to the front of the train.
[330:52.73]He's covered in blood.
[330:53.41]He's been eating them.
[330:56.55]Excuse me.
[330:59.20]Look at his face.
[331:00.30]Hold on, I gotta... Perfect opportunity for a fucking family photo.
[331:22.48]I can't... Okay, here we go.
[331:28.26]I actually can't, like, get in a good spot, because I can't crouch.
[331:38.22]I can't do handheld and crouched?
[331:40.62]That's bullshit.
[331:41.78]Why?
[331:58.34]I can't really get the image that I want.
[332:19.76]Ah, that's so annoying.
[332:20.68]I have to be like sloppily facing the right direction.
[332:31.72]He's inside the train.
[332:35.15]Is he though?
[332:37.77]Oh no.
[332:45.38]I don't make the rules.
[333:02.49]I can make an exception.
[333:03.27]Alright, we gotta move on to the next town.
[333:06.68]Because they're gonna start to despawn here.
[333:09.04]Unless... No, there are no passengers on that.
[333:14.76]Let's go.
[333:18.57]We need fresh blood.
[333:30.58]For a second I thought I had the wrong train.
[333:33.64]What do you think of a settlement that's not a major town?
[333:41.48]With a bunch of animals.
[334:00.01]I like to play with trains.
[334:02.55]It's kind of fun.
[334:03.73]Go ahead, you can cross.
[334:18.96]Found our place.
[334:21.66]Witness and investigate.
[334:25.63]Are these lawyers?
[334:27.01]I think these are lawyers.
[334:59.40]Got some more food for ya!
[335:02.28]Hello!
[335:03.86]Watch out!
[335:04.88]Dinner's here!
[335:10.01]Don't you dare bite your dad.
[335:17.15]Feed me, Seymour!
[335:29.96]I don't like him being right here, though.
[335:31.06]I feel like I'm gonna step on him.
[335:33.96]Okay, let's keep going.
[335:49.08]Might be time for a little bit of wildlife.
[335:54.40]I'm going to get to a good spot for that, though.
[335:56.70]Name the boss?
[335:57.92]Francis.
[336:00.56]Francis the boss.
[336:04.92]Alright, I need to get to another little settlement here.
[336:22.79]I need like another 10 to 15 people.
[336:33.18]I'm not going to get out for just one deer.
[336:35.72]That's why there are like eight.
[336:40.48]Let's do it.
[336:49.79]I don't give a shit about the meat quality.
[337:08.51]I hear something.
[337:09.03]I hear somebody running around.
[337:17.50]Ooh, is this a house?
[337:18.36]What the hell is this?
[337:23.95]I don't have time to, like, explore.
[337:38.35]One squirrel.
[337:42.25]One squirrel.
[337:43.33]And I can't even drop him.
[337:44.57]I just put him in my pocket.
[337:57.03]Feed Francis.
[337:57.67]I'm trying.
[337:58.45]I just need... Oh, here comes somebody.
[338:06.20]I think it's time to get some lawmen on me here.
[338:13.34]No tell on me.
[338:19.94]Okay.
[338:20.74]Bring it back to the train.
[338:27.39]That guy got up on me quick!
[338:35.61]No, don't drag him.
[338:36.39]Don't drag him.
[338:47.92]He's on a horse.
[338:49.19]Yeah, but... I don't think he's gonna be that fast.
[339:17.18]I'm not trying to... Okay, here we go.
[339:19.02]Here they come.
[339:26.65]Bring them on.
[339:28.87]Get a little closer.
[339:29.61]Get a little closer.
[339:30.21]That's fine.
[339:49.36]Load him up!
[339:56.97]Okay, it's gonna take them forever to clean this train.
[340:05.31]Yes, it is.
[340:15.36]He's right there, Francis.
[340:16.54]He's fine.
[340:17.80]He just was saying hello.
[340:19.88]He was like, hey, how are you?
[340:20.82]How are you?
[340:21.12]Are they still investigating?
[340:31.84]Apparently not.
[340:36.29]Oh, are they coming from this direction now?
[340:41.63]Might have to put him down.
[340:43.15]I'd rather you come in here.
[341:00.27]How we doing?
[341:00.55]That's it?
[341:02.85]Right next to the train.
[341:03.59]Perfect.
[341:03.97]I'm gonna start moving here.
[341:22.48]I need some core refilling.
[341:37.05]You should tame the fox.
[341:38.26]That's pretty cool, actually.
[341:39.52]This guy's falling out.
[341:41.84]Re... Recalibrate this dude.
[341:56.81]You know, some people speedrun video games.
[342:00.31]Do it as fast as possible.
[342:03.45]Some people spend a lot of time getting really good and get competitive.
[342:09.69]Some people are, you know, personalities.
[342:11.32]And they look at all the things that they say and all the funny things that they do.
[342:16.76]I feel trained with bodies until my PlayStation crashes.
[342:21.76]So, I'm just kind of coming to these terms here.
[342:31.79]More.
[342:32.25]Oh, and they're fresh, too.
[342:34.37]There's a lot of people.
[342:37.08]I gotta be careful.
[342:43.53]Oh, shit!
[343:25.16]Let me do some just general maintenance here.
[343:35.28]How's it doing?
[343:35.82]Clean it up.
[343:46.43]Come on.
[343:47.03]Hurry up.
[343:57.22]well the real kicker here is to try to see if this works is it's then you might not be able to have more than like 50 to 30 to 50 or something bodies on the screen at the same time and it'll be a thing where they just actually despawn but I'm willing to give it a try let's go more right here
[344:34.30]The game is starting to hate this.
[344:37.30]But at what point will they turn us off?
[344:39.19]You know what I mean?
[344:39.67]At what point do I not get to do it anymore?
[344:44.31]When is the game actually sick of my shit completely?
[344:48.24]That's the real question.
[344:52.40]I think that's it.
[344:53.14]No, there's one more down here.
[345:07.80]Save the game?
[345:09.30]Saving the game's not gonna do anything.
[345:11.84]Because when you save a game, it just, when you load that save, it puts you... Oh, like you just woke up at a camp!
[345:20.49]Nearby!
[345:21.17]It doesn't, it's not like a state that you're saving.
[345:23.87]It's the time that you're saving.
[345:26.91]Oh, this is starting to hang.
[345:31.75]Starting to hang.
[345:33.29]That's how you know we're getting there.
[345:41.55]Hey little boy!
[345:42.09]All aboard, let's go!
[345:51.53]What was the point of this again?
[345:52.84]Uh, to try to crash the game.
[345:56.42]Or to see how many people I can fit in the train.
[346:00.24]Either one.
[346:09.93]We're about to make it to Micah.
[346:12.03]People?
[346:12.41]Anybody in there?
[346:15.40]I don't think so.
[346:19.80]I don't see anybody in there.
[346:23.98]We don't have any animals.
[346:30.82]We have to hunt the animals.
[346:32.36]The people come to you.
[346:47.06]This is actually pretty cool.
[346:48.18]This looks great.
[347:03.90]That black mask on the minivan.
[347:05.82]Yeah, I'm being followed right now by a monster.
[347:16.43]Does this thing run out of gas?
[347:19.25]I can't quite... Gas.
[347:32.67]Well, you know what I mean.
[347:33.55]I mean, like, can this thing burn out all the coal?
[347:38.71]Stop throwing bodies in there.
[347:46.05]Where are we at now?
[347:48.89]This looks like animal territory.
[347:50.27]I think it's time to put in some animals.
[347:55.75]How far north are we right now?
[348:04.10]Okay, we're about to reach back around here to the fort.
[348:14.07]I guess.
[348:16.61]We'll see where it takes us.
[348:25.49]Try putting bait in the body room.
[348:27.17]Well, aren't they already just... There's a bunch of bait there already.
[348:44.44]Well, we're taking the scenic route.
[348:47.37]I don't see any X's gone.
[348:49.03]I don't think they're decomposing, really.
[348:50.95]From what I can tell from you guys, I can't tell.
[348:53.49]This is the same as it did before.
[349:00.35]I wonder if there's a finite actual amount of time.
[349:11.10]Is it 30 minutes?
[349:11.76]Is it 20 minutes?
[349:12.57]Is it an hour?
[349:13.35]What if they just actually disappear?
[349:15.49]They might not.
[349:16.09]They might just be an entity that's like an asset that's there forever.
[349:19.89]I would assume when you move 100 yards, 200 yards, it went that way.
[349:23.93]And that would be when they'd be spawned.
[349:35.84]This is creepy.
[349:43.58]What's the joke?
[349:44.16]I don't have a plan here.
[349:45.68]The plan is just fill it.
[349:51.30]Until it doesn't fill me.
[349:52.28]I don't have another... That's it.
[350:00.32]I mean... I'm imagining a scenario...
[350:10.67]where they never despawn.
[350:13.79]And it is just stuffed with bodies on top of each other.
[350:22.93]I don't know.
[350:26.60]We're about to come to another town.
[350:35.10]And here's the stop.
[350:36.54]Let's see if anybody's here.
[350:40.85]It's a little late, I think.
[350:46.93]I don't think anybody is here.
[350:52.74]On we go.
[350:53.34]Don't fall off this!
[351:06.91]The box is still there, hanging out.
[351:10.47]Here comes the fort.
[351:11.13]I'm going to get a lot of bodies here.
[351:26.42]Harvesting time.
[351:31.58]Yeah, pretty much.
[351:39.07]Alright.
[351:40.75]I see a camp.
[351:42.31]I can probably get... Is there anybody at that camp?
[351:45.85]I can't tell.
[351:49.46]Because I can just dump him over the edge and pick him up later.
[351:53.46]I mean, there's a horse there.
[352:03.75]No, not worth it.
[352:05.31]Not enough.
[352:11.18]This was Thanos' original plan.
[352:17.91]This is absolutely gorgeous, though.
[352:27.02]We've been driving through so many beautiful things, I feel like I'm about to be taken in.
[352:46.24]Still not really... I mean, Wallace Station is up here.
[352:55.01]We'll probably get 10 to 20 more bodies at Wallace Station.
[353:09.68]By the way, I am so committed to this at the moment that I'm not going to stop this stream until it's satisfied.
[353:21.16]You understand me?
[353:37.35]If you put... If it's been this long already, you have to see it.
[353:44.55]Could I right now be like, oh, it was kind of interesting.
[353:47.47]Oh, well.
[353:49.54]Yeah, I don't move on.
[353:51.20]No.
[353:52.28]What?
[353:55.66]It's been like an hour and 30 minutes of doing this, at least.
[354:04.35]What's the end game for Francis?
[354:05.65]I don't know.
[354:09.21]He's currently my co-conductor right now.
[354:11.53]I don't want him in the back.
[354:20.65]Alright, coming up on the town.
[354:26.43]Let's see if we can't pull a few more people down.
[354:29.53]Eventually I'm going to go all the way around to where my course was.
[354:37.45]CP-985.
[354:37.81]The never-ending train.
[354:47.14]Can you actually befriend the fox?
[354:48.46]I don't think you can.
[354:50.04]Does anybody know how many people are actually on the train right now?
[354:59.55]I would say... 20?
[355:00.19]15? 25?
[355:14.70]No, just one.
[355:15.48]Just one.
[355:18.04]Counting the fox?
[355:21.46]No, not counting the fox.
[355:23.92]It's probably like... I bet you there's like 16 people.
[355:35.03]Alright, let's roll in.
[355:37.89]Rolling in.
[355:39.43]To... Wallace Station.
[355:43.97]Please watch the doors on the left.
[355:46.77]Entering Wallace Station.
[355:52.16]Check for your belongings.
[356:10.48]So I think it has been confirmed that part of that long journey there in between bodies going in, I believe that they're not going to these ones, because they probably would have already.
[356:58.39]Oh, I can't pick him up?
[356:59.77]He's too big for me to pick up?
[357:03.44]Is he too big?
[357:05.26]Shit, he's too big.
[357:06.02]Oh well.
[357:27.24]The train will eat it one way or another.
[357:28.88]That's true.
[357:40.25]Not really, though.
[357:43.27]Whoa!
[357:43.61]Hey!
[357:44.07]Hey, hey!
[357:45.31]Looks like he's coming anyways.
[357:48.01]The train... will take him.
[357:52.33]He's in!
[357:58.82]Well, and welcome to our next stop.
[358:06.94]Howdy.
[358:09.19]You all waiting for the train?
[358:11.57]Well, unfortunately you picked the wrong train to get ready for.
[358:14.79]Have a nice day.
[358:27.59]Oh yeah, call him.
[358:28.92]Get the bald man down here.
[358:37.62]Excuse me, Francis.
[358:38.56]Excuse me.
[358:49.87]Fucking Elk.
[358:52.91]There they come.
[358:54.11]Alright, what do I got for cores?
[358:54.98]Am I good?
[358:58.01]Gonna use a little bit more Deadeye.
[359:08.61]I'm gonna have to craft some meat or something, man.
[359:16.00]It's like all I got.
[359:25.50]Okay.
[359:26.46]Now we wait.
[359:30.56]No, I already have meat.
[359:31.78]You're right.
[359:35.66]Come on in.
[359:39.42]Uh-oh.
[359:40.84]That's not a good sign.
[359:44.41]We're the lawmen.
[359:45.03]Let's go.
[359:47.01]I'm waiting for you.
[359:47.79]I'm here.
[359:48.13]From the west.
[360:02.40]Alright, here they come Might as well use the cover Three of them More now
[360:46.11]Time to feed.
[360:46.63]Let's go.
[360:46.95]Ah, a guy coming in.
[360:49.73]Too hot.
[361:03.05]This bulky ass elk in the way.
[361:04.87]I don't think I can go up this way anymore.
[361:09.78]No, I can't.
[361:11.20]He's blocking that entrance.
[361:21.04]Take the lady's hat.
[361:22.46]You got it.
[361:26.98]I don't want to step on you.
[361:27.90]You need to be in a better splay- Yeah, get out of the way!
[361:30.08]I don't want to step on him!
[361:34.24]Francis!
[361:34.68]Alright, it's getting to a point where I can't walk through here.
[361:43.75]I can't- I'm getting stuck.
[361:45.81]It's getting to the point where I can't stay in here.
[362:00.63]I gotta go through the back.
[362:01.59]I don't know.
[362:10.14]Relax.
[362:14.62]Relax.
[362:21.59]I gotta go from the other side of the train.
[362:24.33]I won't be able to go in there anymore.
[362:34.07]Can I even get up from the other side?
[362:35.15]Are there stairs back here?
[362:36.73]I think so.
[362:38.36]Yeah.
[362:39.12]One, two, three.
[362:40.96]Make a count here.
[363:13.56]I got four more to put in.
[363:21.22]We actually have to keep track at this point, because they might start despawning.
[363:24.14]There's definitely more than three.
[363:26.96]Francis!
[363:27.60]I... mmm...
[364:13.61]There's so many people here.
[364:14.63]There's too many!
[364:19.24]Okay.
[364:50.19]Are there less X's?
[364:53.19]Oh no!
[364:54.91]They're de-spawning!
[365:03.46]Nooo!
[365:06.26]So, I- here's what happened.
[365:09.26]You guys wanna know the sad thing that happened here?
[365:13.08]So, the game- because these are still actual NPCs, right?
[365:19.92]What happened was... And I knew it was worth testing, worth trying to find out.
[365:27.58]There's only a certain amount of NPCs that are, like, allowed.
[365:32.29]Right?
[365:33.85]So once it gets to the point where there's too many NPCs on the screen, it starts to remove them.
[365:39.25]Because it needs to make room for the other NPCs that I'm calling in.
[365:51.36]But that doesn't mean we're not going to have fun with the people that are here.
[365:53.85]So, just let me get them in the right spot.
[365:55.59]I'm going to put them all in the same spot.
[365:56.67]And I'm going to put dynamite down underneath.
[366:08.79]We're hitting the entity limit here.
[366:19.80]That's the joke.
[366:21.20]Well, the joke was I wonder how many people I can fit on the train.
[366:24.67]I don't even know if it was necessarily a joke.
[366:29.45]Just wanted to see what would happen.
[366:32.09]Felt like doing it.
[366:43.18]So, let's get them all in one spot here.
[367:07.57]That's fine.
[367:40.22]Try putting them in a seat.
[367:50.19]I really wonder what's gonna happen here, though.
[368:05.41]There are quite a few people on here.
[368:17.20]I think it'll crash here.
[368:22.94]What the fuck?
[368:25.50]Somebody just sprinted by the right side of the screen.
[368:27.26]Was that my shadow?
[368:28.00]I don't even know.
[368:28.66]Oh god, they're starting to move.
[368:30.93]It's starting to become too much.
[368:32.01]They're starting to meld into one person.
[368:35.29]Oh boy.
[368:35.93]Okay, hurry up.
[368:38.11]Come on.
[368:41.33]Somebody's still alive down there.
[368:47.34]What the fuck?
[368:50.74]Oh, jeez.
[368:58.41]This is, this is demonic.
[369:02.22]This is, somebody said this is, that guy came from the ceiling.
[369:17.97]No, wrong way.
[369:28.34]It's almost like I'm pulling them from underneath.
[369:33.46]Oh, that guy's stretchy.
[369:36.12]You can always tell, when they start to get all stretchy, now here comes the problem.
[369:54.11]There's one right here somewhere, right here?
[370:04.00]It's quite the bear bait.
[370:08.22]Not yet, I gotta make sure they're right in the right pile, because a couple of them are not in the... Oh boy.
[370:20.13]This is demonic.
[370:22.54]This is demonic.
[370:25.50]Okay, alright.
[370:26.44]There's only like one more person over here, I think.
[370:33.23]Francis?
[370:35.43]Stay back.
[370:37.57]Where's this last one?
[370:39.07]I think there's one on top of the train.
[370:50.49]Jesus.
[370:57.90]That guy's stuffed under upside down.
[371:06.72]Alright.
[371:07.58]No, this guy right here.
[371:15.09]Here we go.
[371:19.95]I don't even have... I don't even have dynamite.
[371:33.02]Come on.
[371:35.20]They're despawning!
[371:35.78]Oh sh... No!
[371:43.78]Don't burn!
[371:44.92]No!
[372:21.21]Hey Whisper.
[372:26.13]You didn't even have anything on you, did you?
[372:33.85]Don't worry, it was only a nightmare.
[372:39.44]Oh, alright.
[372:40.64]So, what, um, what the hell were we doing?
[372:47.24]Alright, I was gonna reload the game.
[372:55.26]Damn.
[372:57.78]I wish I had di- I just didn't realize I didn't have dynamite.
[373:01.52]That was unfortunate.
[373:03.77]Was that worth it?
[373:05.33]Let me kind of just see if it was possible.
[373:15.45]Alright.
[373:15.75]So this is 2,250.
[373:16.17]That's the autosave.
[373:17.05]2,141.
[373:17.07]I think this is it, right?
[373:33.31]You knew the rule.
[373:35.85]You were on the train.
[373:40.25]Yeah, so this is the one.
[373:44.97]That was some pretty good stalling.
[373:49.83]You can hear the depression in his voice.
[373:51.43]You can.
[373:51.99]I like really... I at least wanted to do dynamite there.
[373:55.31]I guess that's my own fault for not looking through my inventory first.
[374:14.67]I demand one more- no, that was like almost- that was two hours.
[374:18.68]No, that wasn't that long.
[374:35.29]Redo it on PC when the body count gets to be higher.
[374:43.19]Do I have any soup left?
[374:44.09]No, that's gone.
[374:44.69]That was gone a while ago.
[374:46.69]That's before the first body went on the train.
[374:51.61]That was a third of your stream.
[374:52.75]I just joined it four hours when you started.
[374:54.31]$225 bounty!
[374:59.06]What?
[375:09.56]Wrong save.
[375:10.14]That's... Okay, so which one is it then?
[375:11.78]This one?
[375:13.92]The Course of True Love, 36%.
[375:15.20]Why would I get... Where did the tenth of a percent come from?
[375:21.92]It's one of these two.
[375:23.19]This is... Okay, I manually saved.
[375:24.57]So it's 2129.
[375:28.87]So it was one of these two.
[375:30.45]I guess it could just be this one.
[375:37.61]Yeah, I blame the elk.
[375:54.14]Well, thanks for taking that journey with me, everybody.
[375:58.72]Sorry it didn't end the way that we all wanted, but it was worth it.
[376:09.83]It was worth taking the trip, I think.
[376:28.09]It was a fitting RP ending.
[376:30.59]Ritual suicide.
[376:34.16]God.
[376:35.24]So where the hell am I now?
[376:38.62]So... This was... How much money do I got?
[376:44.82]14, 13?
[376:45.02]$45 bounty sounds about right.
[376:47.54]Oh, this is where the train... This is where... That was so long ago.
[376:53.94]I forgot.
[376:54.44]I forgot about the train going back and forth a bit.
[376:59.50]This is where it all began, you're right.
[377:01.66]Alright, um... Let me... I need to go back to town.
[377:07.25]The thing that I was supposed to do a long time ago.
[377:20.63]God, it's... I haven't played the game in like two hours.
[377:22.67]I...
[377:24.52]I'm like trying to think about putting these people on the train.
[377:27.64]That's like all I know.
[377:29.30]Where the hell is he?
[377:30.01]Is he in the stable?
[377:30.85]Uh, let's bring out Sonic.
[377:50.43]And let's give it a good package.
[377:52.98]Absolutely.
[377:54.36]Good decision.
[378:00.96]The autoslave slot already contains the course of... Do you want to override?
[378:04.46]Yes, I do.
[378:13.35]Let's do this mission, and then we'll see where we're at.
[378:15.77]It's been about six and a half hours so far.
[378:19.78]Let's see where we're at at the end of this mission here.
[378:23.80]Rename the horse to Francis.
[378:25.00]No, I have to go get a new Francis.
[378:30.16]You know what I'm saying?
[378:30.80]I'm not just... I can't just rename this guy.
[378:33.55]I have to tame a new horse and name him Francis.
[378:45.98]How many horses are you allowed to have?
[378:47.08]At the moment, I can have four.
[378:49.97]Four total.
[378:50.53]That might increase later, I don't know.
[379:08.22]Random encounter!
[379:09.16]Well, I guess a snake bite?
[379:18.41]Wanna get by a snake?
[379:19.63]Here.
[379:20.13]You good?
[379:37.47]Okay.
[379:39.05]Okay.
[379:41.51]I just tried that plan over there.
[379:44.51]It was like a gunshot.
[379:49.63]Oh, you're the one with the pink flowers.
[379:55.00]Tiny little bastard.
[379:57.44]Steer clear.
[379:58.74]Thanks, mister.
[380:01.02]I owe you my life.
[380:03.84]Some things you learn the hard way.
[380:07.12]Yeah, you can... you can say that again.
[380:17.48]Another Sage is a poisonous herb.
[380:19.00]Use it in crafting to apply poison to weapons like throwing knives and arrows.
[380:31.81]What are these menus?
[381:00.40]Vomit ability unlocked.
[381:01.74]Well, I can craft poison
[381:17.07]Oh, that's too bad.
[381:17.93]I was thinking I was gonna puke off the horse.
[381:31.57]I'm not gonna feed it to the horse.
[381:32.67]What are you talking about?
[381:33.49]That'd be evil.
[381:34.77]Apply the poison.
[381:38.97]I don't need poison for anything right now.
[381:50.23]Feed it to somebody else's horse?
[382:01.38]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[382:04.73]I don't know why you guys want me to poise on somebody's horse.
[382:12.09]You killed 50 people, and put them on a train, and you're worried about being evil.
[382:19.74]That- I didn't do that.
[382:20.76]The fucking monsters in my head did.
[382:23.66]The demon possessing me made me do that.
[382:25.23]I didn't do that.
[382:29.51]Although there is- let's see what this is.
[382:40.47]The demon possessing me made me do it.
[382:42.25]What?
[382:51.33]I'm in like a cutscene with this guy.
[382:52.85]Why?
[383:02.19]They won't leave him alone.
[383:03.37]I can't stop this.
[383:12.23]I'm not holding down L2.
[383:15.65]It's trying to go into a cutscene with him.
[383:32.85]That train sound is like, kind of freaking me out.
[383:39.56]It's back.
[383:41.74]It's back.
[383:46.26]What if I get it, can I get it on course?
[383:52.37]I can't escape this guy.
[384:02.25]Yeah, I'm permanently locked onto this guy.
[384:12.04]From any angle.
[384:12.66]I have to kill him.
[384:15.08]No, no.
[384:15.86]I need to see how this plays out.
[384:17.95]I can't kill him.
[384:19.41]I want him to get on a horse.
[384:32.56]I can't get on the horse.
[384:40.95]Here's the train.
[384:44.44]The train calls to me.
[384:46.32]It's calling me.
[384:50.77]Be safe, man.
[384:51.99]Later on.
[385:17.66]I gotta find a cliff to jump off.
[385:21.14]I gotta somehow find a cliff to jump off of.
[385:32.91]Get me to... I'm gonna go on the top of a mountain.
[385:35.71]Oh, wait.
[385:36.39]No, I still am.
[385:37.21]Am I locked?
[385:38.73]No.
[385:38.79]Oh, well.
[385:48.66]Did the jump cancel it?
[385:49.54]No, I think I got just too far away.
[385:51.91]He probably despawned.
[385:54.59]He probably despawned, unfortunately, for us.
[386:02.23]Here we go.
[386:12.66]The train commands it.
[386:13.58]Oh, I can't.
[386:14.50]Never mind.
[386:24.82]Alright, on to this.
[386:25.52]We'll do this last mission, and then we'll call it a night, because it is getting late.
[386:35.91]I just want to backhand and hammer fist and punch somebody in the face.
[386:44.07]Just like... BURN!
[387:02.30]Oh, that's a... That was a... That was a guy... That was a... They just don't know when to quit.
[387:35.46]Horse hate!
[387:35.86]Did I ever tell you guys that I can't whistle?
[387:42.25]When I was younger.
[387:44.67]My parents, we had a dog and... You know, my parents' house.
[387:52.17]Hold on.
[387:54.21]Frances?
[388:00.97]Frances?
[388:06.90]No, she's not.
[388:07.92]I think it was somebody else's dog.
[388:09.44]Ah, but... So, I don't know how to whistle.
[388:14.05]Like... I can do it for like a tenth of a second.
[388:21.07]Like... So, I used... When you call your dog, you don't let go.
[388:30.12]Like... Come here!
[388:32.52]I would go...
[388:40.44]Owl!
[388:48.68]I found an owl!
[388:55.25]Perfect timing, apparently.
[389:13.87]I seriously used to say, who, who, to call my dog.
[389:20.99]I just don't know how to whistle.
[389:22.40]Okay, girl.
[389:38.91]What?
[389:41.61]What are we angry at up here?
[389:45.61]Oh, bounty hunters.
[389:48.71]Come on, get it.
[389:49.80]Bounty hunters.
[389:52.12]Bounty hunters.
[389:53.16]Play while you can.
[390:03.27]I don't care.
[390:03.95]Shoot me.
[390:04.69]It'll not stop me.
[390:32.84]He hasn't been the same since the train.
[390:34.42]I'm telling you, I know.
[390:36.66]That's why I just can't go off the rails in these games, because then it's all I know.
[390:40.38]I can't, I'm trying to go back to... Let's go to Dutch and let's get a mission.
[390:46.64]No, I just...
[391:01.96]Where was it?
[391:02.62]I didn't see it.
[391:03.32]Oh, it's you.
[391:05.92]I thought it was a... I thought it was a random encounter.
[391:13.53]Oh, that was a funny voice.
[391:16.85]Well, yeah, you know, funny voices is what I do on this channel.
[391:29.75]Funny voices.
[391:35.72]I'm going to put that in my Twitter bio.
[391:38.64]Funny voices.
[391:39.38]Look at all this stuff we have.
[391:53.83]Online media.
[391:59.97]Thank you.
[392:01.51]Thank you.
[392:03.19]So let me donate this stuff and take my cut.
[392:19.82]Do a funny Homer Bart Simpson voice.
[392:24.36]I don't have... I don't know how to do that.
[392:27.40]Alright, what's my cut?
[392:28.02]I got diamonds here, man.
[392:32.64]Where are the diamonds?
[392:40.76]Did I sell them already?
[392:41.56]Is there anything I didn't buy?
[392:47.29]Let's eat some food.
[393:00.69]What do you say?
[393:12.71]Cooked flakey fish.
[393:17.41]Do a shpee voice.
[393:18.73]The shpee.
[393:19.37]I'm not doing the shpee voice.
[393:21.77]Guys.
[393:23.03]I'm sorry.
[393:25.56]This is the final mission of the night.
[393:28.48]And then... You may... You may see me tomorrow as well.
[393:36.09]But there's a couple things I need to do.
[393:38.49]I might take a break from Red Dead.
[393:39.61]We'll try something else tomorrow night.
[393:42.15]Oh, we might lead into this.
[393:43.43]We'll see.
[393:44.05]I don't know.
[393:44.51]I might just play this again.
[393:47.77]I don't know.
[393:49.35]I might not stream tomorrow.
[393:50.59]I don't know.
[393:51.09]I probably will.
[394:03.74]that ain't my point these ignorant fools are weapon dealers and in their dealing sometimes sit on a decent pile of burnt out oh no no no I've been selling weapons to Cuba and South America for years I am I am absolutely not the old boy I was talking to reckon there might be a bunch of cash just sitting around and failing that maybe a nice stash of weapons just a bunch of crazies garden exactly well
[394:31.35]Worth taking a look at least, isn't it?
[394:33.55]That was my thinking.
[394:34.75]Said it was at some place called Shady Bell, deep in the woods.
[394:37.71]Why does everybody want me to do the shpee?
[394:40.99]I just go, shpee, like that's it.
[394:44.49]That was like the comedy routine like four years ago.
[394:47.67]I was hoping you'd be in.
[394:49.37]If it's how they told it, it's going to be something alright.
[394:52.64]We'll see.
[394:58.50]He did it.
[394:59.20]Oh, he did it.
[395:15.58]Alright.
[395:18.08]Let's go.
[395:18.60]Remember that one?
[395:21.46]I might have met these crazies before.
[395:24.87]Remember I did that four years ago?
[395:27.99]No.
[395:29.05]Well, yes, but no, that's not how I might have met them.
[395:44.39]Star Wars theme
[396:03.82]Pecklewood idiots in the state of Lemoyne.
[396:06.20]That's for sure.
[396:06.90]Is it really that different in this state?
[396:10.32]We haven't come far.
[396:11.86]It seems like it is.
[396:13.50]These boys got a manner about them, but I haven't necessarily noticed.
[396:19.19]All respect, Mr. Morgan.
[396:21.59]You wouldn't notice.
[396:23.48]My dog is... You can't whistle, but you can do that.
[396:25.18]No, I can't.
[396:25.50]I cannot whistle.
[396:25.92]Well, I don't know.
[396:50.66]Guess it can't be so easy for you, Lenny.
[396:54.30]Sorry you're caught up in this.
[396:56.42]We demand more.
[396:58.17]I guess their gold still shines.
[396:59.83]Well, there is no more.
[397:00.87]And their guns still shoot.
[397:02.95]I just played a sound clip.
[397:03.89]I queued it up when I played it.
[397:05.61]And every one of these bastards for all they got.
[397:08.85]Ha ha, okay then.
[397:11.28]Plus, it beats being lynched back in Blackwater with all of you by my side.
[397:16.56]I guess it does.
[397:19.82]More voices needed.
[397:33.05]Feels like we're close.
[397:34.57]It's a rundown old plantation house down in the bayou somewhere.
[397:38.93]Let's take it slow.
[397:40.65]Be cautious.
[397:42.43]It makes up for no whistle.
[397:46.13]It's called sitting here just playing a video game.
[397:52.04]And just doing that.
[397:53.90]Back before streaming and YouTube and everything, guys, I used to sit here and do the same shit I do now.
[398:00.38]There just wasn't anybody watching.
[398:03.72]Where are the recto Civil War holdouts?
[398:07.96]I would just- I would just sit here and like make noises.
[398:10.52]I was always watching.
[398:12.08]Wasn't I already here?
[398:35.06]Old content.
[398:35.88]I've already seen this.
[398:36.70]I already took the stuff from here.
[398:37.86]Hitman 2 comes out in three days.
[398:43.83]There's so much out and coming out.
[398:45.75]I was already here.
[398:46.17]I came here too early.
[399:11.70]No, don't do it.
[399:13.52]It's the last mission.
[399:17.49]Okay.
[399:18.49]Yeah.
[399:43.24]Okay, Springfield rifle without the scope on it.
[399:49.04]It's getting late.
[400:07.31]It is getting late.
[400:08.19]Once it gets to be about midnight.
[400:13.13]12, 1230 Eastern Time.
[400:13.85]It's time to call it a night.
[400:15.55]I got it.
[400:15.79]I can't see.
[400:16.65]Oh, now I can.
[400:17.64]Maybe I should have the other rifle then.
[400:19.48]No, this thing's fine.
[400:38.99]Do you see anything?
[400:39.65]Yes.
[400:40.79]Yes.
[400:41.07]There you are.
[400:47.77]Is my internal clock adjusted?
[400:49.09]Almost a militia.
[400:52.38]It is at this point, yeah.
[400:54.34]It's been pretty good.
[400:55.00]You got a man covering the house?
[401:02.86]Got a Gatling gun up there, too.
[401:05.38]I got that house locked down real tight.
[401:08.95]I know, I know.
[401:09.59]I just wanted to see if I could see him.
[401:38.58]Hey!
[401:40.15]Hey!
[401:44.23]To the left of you!
[401:46.65]We got something, right?
[401:48.27]Oh, we got something.
[401:50.25]We can hit them head on, fight them honest.
[401:54.03]Or you could go down there acting friendly.
[401:57.10]Friendly?
[401:58.10]With these folks?
[401:59.80]Just draw them into one spot, then I'll start shooting.
[402:04.76]Well, that might be the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
[402:07.57]But hey, I'm always up for a performance.
[402:10.70]Yeah, on the tuba desk of gun.
[402:14.18]Just give the word.
[402:16.44]Who's shooting?
[402:21.96]What the fuck is going on?
[402:23.08]Okay, Lenny, uh... The dynamite's more fun.
[402:32.56]You save your play acting for Jose and the girls.
[402:36.09]Huh.
[403:11.58]Got him.
[403:24.63]Hold on.
[403:25.09]Don't do anything yet.
[403:25.97]He's gonna get charged again.
[403:37.03]It's so hard to aim with this stick.
[403:51.33]Holy shit!
[403:52.75]Alright, get me out of this spell.
[404:20.86]Take the scope off.
[404:21.80]Give me my keyboard.
[404:43.44]Give me my mouse back.
[405:00.88]Oh fuck That didn't hit him?
[405:31.07]Alright, what else we got?
[405:39.91]Go back to this.
[405:44.04]Go to the front door.
[405:50.82]Open up.
[405:51.50]Okay.
[406:02.25]That was crazy.
[406:02.59]Sounds like a plan.
[406:03.25]Search the area for weapons.
[406:04.15]Fuck, okay.
[406:04.41]Oh, what about the Gatling gun?
[406:05.61]Hey, let's take the Gatling gun.
[406:30.92]Can I have him?
[406:34.84]Can I remove the dynamite off this thing?
[406:39.60]I don't think I want the dynamite.
[406:45.42]Is this a scenario where any little bump will cause a problem?
[406:50.67]I'm doing it.
[406:56.48]I'm trying to go as fast as I can.
[406:58.08]Shoot the dynamite with turbo boost.
[407:05.76]Something tells me that's not gonna work.
[407:07.58]Hey, riders, coming our way.
[407:10.16]Okay, keep a cool head.
[407:12.12]What's a black feller doing coming out of Shady Bell in one of our wagons?
[407:18.96]You see, we already dropped a bunch of your people to get this wagon.
[407:25.74]In the heart.
[407:26.68]In the brain.
[407:27.26]In the balls.
[407:31.93]In the head.
[407:34.01]In the balls.
[407:35.85]In the brain.
[407:36.51]In the balls.
[407:56.00]How do you, Deadeye?
[407:56.70]R3!
[407:56.74]Let's move!
[407:57.04]The heart, the brain, and the horse.
[408:23.49]But we'll see what we do.
[408:24.43]I might take a little break tomorrow.
[408:43.88]Depends.
[408:44.98]Who knows?
[408:45.34]I could just wake up and want to do it again.
[408:48.88]But ever since we've gotten internet back... Well, let's rephrase that.
[408:52.79]Ever since the internet has been gone, it's really the only thing we've been focusing on every day since two weeks ago.
[408:59.61]There's still a lot of other random shit that needs to get done.
[409:03.61]So, I might take tomorrow to do some of that.
[409:06.07]And when I get done with it, I might be able to turn the stream on.
[409:10.70]I'm just glad I've been able to stream for three straight days, four straight days in a row.
[409:14.34]Without any major problems, so that's... That's good.
[409:18.43]Good news, I think.
[409:24.49]When's the green screen planned?
[409:25.39]The green screen is planned... For at some point over this weekend.
[409:29.09]And if not this weekend, then either... I would assume Monday or Tuesday of next week.
[409:34.94]Just in terms of... Just based on studio time.
[409:43.04]I'll have a clear answer for you in the next probably day or two I still have my L.A.
[409:53.26]Noire save
[410:01.68]Wee.
[410:03.92]I don't think I do.
[410:06.24]Because I don't have my PlayStation anymore.
[410:11.55]Uh oh.
[410:13.39]Hmm.
[410:13.59]Are they cloud safe?
[410:23.47]Bolt action rifle is now available to modify.
[410:25.49]Because you now own it.
[410:28.83]Alright, cool.
[410:30.79]So let me just... This is a pretty good time to stop.
[410:36.62]And that is where we're going to stop.
[410:40.42]Right here?
[410:45.48]But yeah, I don't... I gotta check on the LA Noir thing, see if I can pick up where I left off.
[410:52.23]Oh, boy.
[410:55.99]So LA, not LA tomorrow, Red Dead Redemption.
[410:59.03]If I stream tomorrow, it probably won't be Red Dead.
[411:01.74]I might change my mind, but we'll probably pivot to something else.
[411:09.48]Tomorrow is Wednesday, right?
[411:13.09]technically well yeah well first it's 9 30 right now pacific but so tomorrow's technically Wednesday so I might give myself a day to uh to get the green screen situated for the weekend and then come back on Thursday or Wednesday night we'll see like I said I don't really have a schedule right now so I'm trying to figure that out as we speak but thanks everybody for sticking around I will see you all very very soon
[411:44.95]Thanks again for watching.
[411:46.49]Red Dead is a wonderful game.
[411:50.05]Highly recommend.
[411:52.11]So let's go ahead and do the bits while they're here.
[411:54.64]Let's go back a while here.
[412:00.04]Back to here.
[412:03.46]Had 200 bits, 2 bucks from Ivory.
[412:08.97]Thank you, Ivory, for the $2.
[412:10.98]Hey, Jerma, it's been a hot while since I caught your livestream due to job searching and European trips.
[412:17.34]That said, I always enjoy the videos that get posted on your second channel, and I'm so happy to see Wall Dad finally posted.
[412:23.37]Special thanks to Holy Mac, and I can't wait to see more of the funny man.
[412:27.41]Also, side question, have you voted yet, or can you not do that now that you are in Nevada?
[412:33.45]Well, for the purposes of political stuff, we don't talk about politics on this stream.
[412:40.55]That's a very, very important rule.
[412:46.36]Unless we make a joke.
[412:50.80]You can't do it because he's a convict.
[412:57.67]Yeah, you know, I mean, I did get arrested nine times, so...
[413:03.72]I'm actually coming to you from a federal prison right now.
[413:06.26]So, uh... To answer the first part here, I am very glad to see Wall Dad as well, because that's one of my favorite games of the year.
[413:27.82]Little boys can't vote.
[413:33.30]Oh my god.
[413:43.75]Is Francis in jail, too?
[413:52.09]No.
[413:55.07]But thank you, dude.
[413:57.05]Thank you, bro.
[413:57.69]Luck for the five dollars.
[413:58.63]I'm very poor and I don't have much money.
[414:05.15]Jerma doesn't know politics enough that, yes, I voted.
[414:07.71]Well, okay, no, I did not vote.
[414:09.09]There you go.
[414:11.14]And I'll tell you one reason why.
[414:12.22]Because of the move, I didn't have, like, an opportunity to go register in Nevada.
[414:19.24]So, sorry.
[414:24.93]There's been a lot going on.
[414:25.91]I just didn't have an opportunity to.
[414:33.39]I am registered to vote in Massachusetts still, so... Literally Satan.
[414:47.75]I actually was gonna do it.
[414:49.05]I think you could do it.
[414:49.83]There's like a way you could have done it or something.
[414:51.81]I just... There's been so much bullshit going on here.
[414:56.33]The whole internet thing moving in here.
[414:58.25]I just... It was something that I just couldn't even think.
[415:08.00]but hopefully all of you have a voice to your opinions because it is important at least if you know talking about the American election stuff and the candidates for Nevada too that's another thing like I just need I haven't I don't like know the area I don't know the people
[415:39.82]I bet he voted for Dean Dingus.
[415:44.66]I wrote in Jerma.
[415:47.54]Oh, God.
[415:54.42]But I am planning on being registered.
[416:02.14]But there's other reasons why.
[416:09.42]To not get political.
[416:12.30]Because I don't like to talk about it on the stream, like I said.
[416:14.42]I don't know.
[416:19.15]I can't really talk about it.
[416:20.87]As to why, like, I'm... I haven't, like, voted.
[416:24.05]It's understandable.
[416:39.03]The tough thing with politics is... Nah, no, no, no, no.
[416:44.91]Whatever.
[416:52.67]It would be impossible to explain some of these things without somehow making somebody angry.
[416:58.38]And that's kind of sad, I think, in the current political spectrum.
[417:06.20]He wants to talk about it so bad.
[417:07.76]No.
[417:28.18]He didn't vote because he's not actually American.
[417:31.10]No.
[417:33.90]We'll just move on.
[417:37.93]That is actually something that I'm going to try to get done here, though.
[417:41.27]Is to, like, register in Nevada.
[417:45.56]But we'll move on.
[417:53.26]Anywho.
[417:55.46]Thank you to... Where were we?
[418:00.52]DivUSP, thanks for the three bucks.
[418:02.08]No message, thank you.
[418:10.80]Just the last couple of nights, DivUSP has just given money.
[418:13.88]Thank you.
[418:17.13]A burger.
[418:17.95]Thank you, Burger B, for the $5 here, Burger B. Thank you.
[418:21.03]Turbo Heart, to you.
[418:25.91]Dungeness, thank you Dungeness for the one dollar.
[418:27.66]Hey Jerma, a couple of people in Discord and I worked on this for a few days straight and I was hoping you could play it on stream.
[418:33.46]A few sleepless nights were had to try to get this out before you started streaming again.
[418:36.70]Your move is very close to home for me because I'm gonna be moving to from Oregon to New Zealand for a university in a couple months and I'll be there for the next eight years at least.
[418:47.71]Damn.
[418:51.34]That's a long time.
[418:58.78]Uh, yeah, well, we'll watch it.
[419:01.88]We'll watch, let's watch it at the end.
[419:05.51]But good luck with the move.
[419:06.29]That's a, that's a long ways, man.
[419:08.41]It's very far away.
[419:15.89]Hopefully that is very smooth.
[419:17.87]Hopefully it goes smoothly for you.
[419:20.07]Just going from Massachusetts to Nevada was...
[419:24.33]fucking painful, so.
[419:25.95]I can imagine going from Oregon to New Zealand will be tough, so.
[419:31.09]Good luck to you.
[419:32.57]And we'll play it at the end of the stream.
[419:37.12]WildFox, thanks for the $1.
[419:38.62]Thank you for what you said on my $10 bits the other night.
[419:40.78]I'm doing my best and your infectious laugh does wonders.
[419:43.96]How is life treating you in Vegas now that you've settled in a little bit?
[419:48.43]Um, settling in nicely.
[419:50.96]I think the last three or four days, especially the last probably four or five days, has really let me breathe a little.
[419:59.88]Because it's been three weeks straight of just kind of bullshit on top of bullshit.
[420:07.01]But I haven't really had much time to myself.
[420:10.83]And by time to myself, I mean...
[420:14.77]There's been something going on every day that needed 100% of my attention.
[420:20.76]And now... I can kind of just chill now.
[420:25.52]As of probably today.
[420:27.34]Or yesterday.
[420:32.53]So, thankfully, it's time to take a breather.
[420:36.37]Step back and actually enjoy and understand where I am.
[420:42.14]So the moving process went through all the internet.
[420:46.16]I wish I could even describe just how painful that internet process was.
[420:52.62]We would have to sit here and wait for a technician to show up.
[420:58.69]Nine technicians have come over here.
[421:01.69]Three supervisors.
[421:04.17]It's been every day.
[421:05.91]We've been on it every single day.
[421:07.63]It's the only thing we've been thinking about and doing.
[421:12.19]And they told us they finally figured it out.
[421:15.94]But then just trying to figure out when the trash comes and where things are.
[421:21.98]It's throwing yourself into a brand new thing that you've never seen or done before.
[421:28.05]I've never done it before.
[421:30.29]It's actually never happened.
[421:32.57]This is the first time in my whole life that I've just kind of thrown myself into a completely different place.
[421:38.39]And something you don't realize when you do that is everything starts from scratch.
[421:45.31]Everything.
[421:48.83]So, I mean, my whole life, literally everything, everything I've ever done, everything I've ever said, everything, everywhere I've ever been was Massachusetts.
[421:57.74]And you start to realize all the little things that just don't follow you here.
[422:04.66]It's a brand new, fresh start.
[422:10.64]And it's equally parts refreshing and kind of nerve-wracking, too.
[422:19.30]I love it out here, though.
[422:19.98]I think it's great.
[422:26.05]His death can't get him now.
[422:27.43]It's okay, Jerma.
[422:31.19]I lived here in Texas my entire life, and I still don't know where the trash comes.
[422:38.52]But it's been wild.
[422:39.32]And I'm finally happy just to be able to get kind of off the ride for a little while.
[422:44.15]And get back to what I was doing.
[422:47.31]Which was this.
[422:47.83]And...
[422:51.09]Being able to at least even enjoy anything else besides... Okay, so I gotta get a new insurance.
[422:57.37]I don't have health insurance right now.
[422:59.17]I've been having like weird medical problems.
[423:00.98]I need health insurance.
[423:01.76]But how long is that thing?
[423:03.14]I gotta get like a letter of termination for my other insurance.
[423:05.82]Okay, no, I don't have health insurance though.
[423:07.36]Okay, but what about like other... Okay, I gotta pay the rent.
[423:11.10]Okay, hold on, but... What day is it?
[423:14.36]I don't have a couch.
[423:15.44]We need to go get a sofa.
[423:16.04]We don't have any furniture.
[423:17.90]I can only fit so much in my moving thing.
[423:22.17]It's been like that every fucking day.
[423:29.11]But, we're good now.
[423:31.44]All the- everything's gravy.
[423:35.46]Thank you, Gaga Pudding, for the two bucks.
[423:38.88]I'm just popping in here to give you a couple bits.
[423:40.22]I'm glad your move went well, and I hope you didn't hit too many squirrels.
[423:44.61]Well, I was in an airplane, so that would've been really weird.
[423:49.64]Bullwinkle would have been really upset if we'd hit a squirrel in the ear.
[423:53.46]Let's just say that.
[423:54.08]Yeah, I think I'd like to get some input from a lot of different people to see like what would be fun to do and what would be even possible to do.
[424:22.84]Whatever the possibilities are.
[424:25.64]I would love to see them.
[424:29.68]So, I mean, I'll be around the Discord.
[424:32.68]I'll probably be talking about... I'll probably bring it up at some point in the Discord.
[424:35.64]And maybe talk to some of the mods about... Maybe try to figure out something fun to do.
[424:40.92]Suggestion-wise.
[424:44.36]But thank you, Lazy Luke.
[424:50.58]And yeah, I will probably...
[424:53.91]I'll put up a more, a cleaner forum than just, like, general chat.
[425:00.23]Uh, Gaga putting, thank you again for $2.
[425:01.95]Hey, it's me again.
[425:02.75]Hope you didn't hit any flying squirrels either.
[425:04.53]They're a fierce bunch.
[425:05.43]Well, there you go.
[425:07.16]There's the flying squirrel, uh... There's the flying squirrel bit.
[425:12.48]Thank you, Gaga.
[425:14.72]Uh, Makelgrun, thanks for the $1.
[425:16.68]Kill him, do it.
[425:17.36]I don't know who you're referring to.
[425:18.54]Hopefully I didn't.
[425:20.03]Hopefully I waved at him.
[425:28.22]Gaga Pudding again, thanks for $5 Gaga Pudding.
[425:32.01]Hey Jeremy, never mind the squirrels this time.
[425:33.83]I remember when I first saw your shwee videos and I thought they were hilarious.
[425:37.41]So I showed them to some of my friends in school and only got blank stares.
[425:41.77]That's when I realized that I had found something special.
[425:45.96]Thanks dude.
[425:50.78]I've already told you the story about how I showed that girl the auto video and then she like literally did not want to talk to me anymore.
[425:59.13]Sounds about right.
[426:01.11]KXE, thank you for the $5, KXE.
[426:04.61]Just put the old guy out of his misery.
[426:06.31]Oh dear.
[426:09.09]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[426:11.69]I made this for you a while ago, Jerma.
[426:13.21]It's you and your trusty balloon buddy.
[426:16.32]Liam.
[426:18.46]Like helium, but his name is Liam.
[426:20.88]And I clever.
[426:22.38]Please don't ban me.
[426:26.26]There's only one person that I knew from the balloons and
[426:29.12]I don't know what happened to him.
[426:34.28]That's a very, that's a beautiful balloon.
[426:39.53]That's a beauty.
[426:43.25]Thank you, Garfield.
[426:45.49]He ate him.
[426:46.33]I did not.
[426:48.23]Thank you, Dan Boss for the one dollar.
[426:49.91]No message.
[426:50.66]Thank you.
[426:52.49]CoolCoolG1, thanks for the three bucks.
[426:55.01]Hey Jerma, can you take your shoes off, please?
[426:56.83]I don't have any shoes on right now.
[426:59.06]But thank you, though.
[427:01.82]Thank you, eefs, for the one dollar.
[427:03.02]Hope you're doing alright, Jerma.
[427:04.08]Just want you to know that these comeback streams really have been keeping me sane through this rut I've been in.
[427:10.56]You truly are a saint.
[427:12.50]Also, just want to apologize for my drunkenness the other night.
[427:15.60]Also, when you start watching JoJo, I want a synopsis on each stream of what episode you watched.
[427:20.59]Okay.
[427:22.14]But apologies from the other... What happened last night?
[427:25.30]What happened the other night?
[427:27.64]You didn't come... I didn't notice anything strange.
[427:34.26]But thank you.
[427:35.01]Also for your $2 here, Eaves.
[427:38.45]I see you did a little recreation of D4C Love Train.
[427:42.35]I'm glad that you support our... We don't talk politics on here.
[427:51.82]Thank you.
[427:54.02]Is that a JoJo thing?
[428:04.12]Thank you, Pilot Guy, for the $5, Pilot Guy.
[428:08.34]There are some bits for the Soul Train.
[428:10.84]Thank you.
[428:12.18]Much appreciated.
[428:13.98]Wild, a buddy.
[428:14.84]Thanks for the $1.
[428:16.26]Can't think of anything funny to say.
[428:17.57]You were a fucking psycho on this stream.
[428:19.27]I'm going to go to bed tomorrow.
[428:20.31]It's tomorrow now.
[428:21.43]Thank you.
[428:26.39]Thank you.
[428:27.49]Thank you, Reaper, for the $1.
[428:28.67]Hey, Jerma, want the best free horse in the game?
[428:30.35]I don't want to read any spoilers.
[428:37.29]Appreciate the...
[428:39.65]Appreciate the tip, but I don't want to know.
[428:45.38]Thank you.
[428:47.48]Thank you, Alpha X Prime.
[428:49.34]Thank you, Alpha Prime, for the $1.
[428:51.96]Varian, thanks for the $1.
[428:53.20]Much of love from General 3 from the Discord.
[428:56.96]Thank you, Varian.
[428:58.21]Appreciate it.
[429:02.65]Deus Morte, thanks for the $1.
[429:03.97]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching since SWAT 4.
[429:06.01]SWAT 4?
[429:10.77]We haven't done that yet.
[429:13.67]Love your stream.
[429:14.27]My state of Michigan just legalized weed.
[429:16.14]Can't wait for the green screen stream.
[429:17.76]Well, there you go.
[429:21.92]We haven't done SWAT 4 yet, though.
[429:24.20]SWAT 4?
[429:27.78]Star and I were going to play SWAT 4, but you can't play it online.
[429:31.62]You have to do weird shit, and we were trying to figure it out.
[429:36.96]But the state of Michigan has legalized weed.
[429:40.78]Well, hell yeah.
[429:45.18]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the one dollar.
[429:48.40]Uh, you never guess who... who I heard from.
[429:52.04]Francis the Fox contacted me after you burnt yourself to death.
[429:55.73]He got you a postcard from the ghost soul train.
[429:58.55]He told me to tell you I'm keeping the train full of souls for you.
[430:01.83]If you ever feel like coming back, miss you, don't forget to write.
[430:06.35]Got any nice words for Francis?
[430:16.70]Getting political.
[430:19.11]We don't talk about politics.
[430:26.63]Marijuana is legal in Las Vegas.
[430:28.25]It is.
[430:28.93]Completely.
[430:31.99]I don't smoke marijuana.
[430:33.35]I don't.
[430:35.03]But I know the medical and recreational purposes for it.
[430:41.55]I mean, I'm not gonna get political.
[430:45.88]That's like, okay, but, alright, first of all, saying that you're in favor of marijuana use, is, that's barely even a political statement anymore.
[431:00.02]That's not, that's like not even political anymore.
[431:06.64]It's just an opinion at this point.
[431:12.50]No politics.
[431:13.42]I know.
[431:14.06]I... Sometimes I wish we could just talk politics.
[431:19.70]Like, very, very... Like, just plainly.
[431:22.46]Insanely.
[431:23.08]But it's not... It's not possible.
[431:28.30]Everybody's so different.
[431:29.42]Everybody has so many different views that it's just... It's impossible.
[431:37.12]I don't know.
[431:37.70]I mean, like, not that I do, but I'm just saying.
[431:39.48]Like, some... Like, it's hard...
[431:43.09]Because, I mean, there are people that are here, right?
[431:46.03]Let's just say that there is, you know, 2,000, 3,000 people there, and I say something.
[431:50.14]And I say something that I believe, right?
[431:54.42]It's always going to just cause a problem.
[431:58.68]Even if the thing that I think I believe in, you know, it's just hard.
[432:03.39]You can't.
[432:08.49]It's not impossible.
[432:09.25]People just need to be more willing to listen to others.
[432:12.10]Yeah.
[432:12.22]Yeah.
[432:15.53]Yeah.
[432:18.43]Yes.
[432:20.73]Yes.
[432:25.23]Political parties.
[432:26.63]Yeah, I mean, like, yes.
[432:28.73]That's all I can say.
[432:29.47]Yes.
[432:35.77]We're willing to listen to your opinions as long as you don't support Bubsy 3D.
[432:39.14]Yes.
[432:40.44]Yes.
[432:50.65]The only thing is, people are very dynamic.
[432:54.07]And... Yes.
[433:00.82]That's it.
[433:09.25]How could you say something like that?
[433:12.23]Yes.
[433:13.21]That's it.
[433:25.74]I agree with that.
[433:33.20]Who should I vote for?
[433:34.14]Yes.
[433:34.44]I honestly don't want to know Jerma's political views.
[433:40.31]I've already had artists and entertainers I admire tarnished in my eyes by knowing their views and I'd rather that not happen with me.
[433:45.57]Yeah, I don't, I just don't want, I don't want that either.
[433:53.47]I don't think any of the things that I believe are
[433:56.99]That's out of the ordinary.
[433:58.49]That's crazy or anything.
[434:02.39]I like to try to think of myself as just try to look at issues rationally and I don't think there's anything I could ever really say that would be like, Whoa!
[434:12.89]What the fuck did he just say?
[434:15.35]I don't think so.
[434:21.14]That's what everyone thinks about their own beliefs.
[434:22.76]That's why they believe it.
[434:23.62]That's true.
[434:24.16]That's completely 100% true.
[434:36.70]Stop before you regret.
[434:37.58]No, I would never, I'm not, I'm not gonna say very much at all, so don't worry.
[434:46.48]The only reason why it's even brought up in the first place is because, like, today was the day.
[434:50.11]So, that's the only reason why it's even brought up in the first place.
[435:09.83]I can't believe how level-headed this guy is.
[435:11.84]I haven't even, like, made any opinions.
[435:13.58]I've said yes, and... That's all I've said.
[435:17.46]This guy said yes.
[435:27.23]But, anywho.
[435:29.05]It's just because today was the day.
[435:31.33]And some people have questions and opinions, and I get it.
[435:34.27]Like, people want to know...
[435:36.38]hey, I did this, I voted, you voted, and what did you vote for?
[435:40.58]And it's like, you know, just, it is, today was the day of all these changes in seats and stuff, so it makes sense as to why people wanted to know.
[436:00.68]But, Gondolin, thanks for the $1.00.
[436:04.58]Excited for you to get back to L.A.
[436:05.68]Noire, although I don't know what your plan probably will be for the save.
[436:09.90]I don't know if you can download a save for the PS4 or download it for the PC and download a save there.
[436:15.22]Because with a 100% save, you can access all the cases or just play it on your own, your choice.
[436:22.17]I'll have to see how that... I didn't get that far in L.A.
[436:24.79]Noire, so I don't think it'll be that much of a problem.
[436:32.49]But thank you, dude.
[436:34.08]Thanks dude.
[436:34.40]I was waiting for one.
[436:35.06]I was waiting for one to show up.
[437:03.71]Thanks.
[437:04.21]Worth millions.
[437:06.52]Shootman.
[437:07.04]Thank you, Shootman, for the $1.
[437:08.48]Keep up the good work, my dude.
[437:09.42]I'm currently finishing my undergrad at university, and I'm thinking of doing a master's.
[437:14.14]Your streams always give good vibes, and it makes studying fun.
[437:17.16]I had a dream Comcast never turned off your internet, and you kept streaming for a month straight.
[437:22.63]You stayed in the house when new tenants moved in, living in the walls, never stopping the stream.
[437:27.49]The tenants were trying to investigate random snorting noises like it was a ghost.
[437:32.03]I'm glad that's not real.
[437:37.88]Thank you, Shootman.
[437:40.20]Uh, thank you HippoRider for the one dollar.
[437:41.80]Hey Jerma, I want to know your thoughts on Fallout 76 and Doom Eternal.
[437:45.52]Also, love your content, helped me through so many very tough times.
[437:49.58]I don't really, I don't have any opinions on either of them.
[437:52.43]The only opinions, the only things I know about Fallout 76 are that, like, the game just, like, didn't work.
[437:59.05]I don't have any opinions on it.
[438:00.19]I just saw my Twitter feed was exploding of, like, Fallout 76 is broken and it sucks, I can't play it.
[438:06.07]There's all these problems!
[438:07.11]I don't have any opinions because I didn't do it, so... Political fallout fuse.
[438:15.53]But thank you.
[438:18.52]Sorry, I don't have an opinion for you.
[438:23.84]Thank you, Deus Morte, for the $1.
[438:25.60]I meant to say Police Quest SWAT, not SWAT 4.
[438:27.92]Oh, right, right, right.
[438:30.45]The FMV game, that's right.
[438:34.35]Thank you, though, Deus.
[438:36.87]Thank you Dark Soul for the one dollar.
[438:39.05]Abnormality for the five dollars.
[438:41.52]Right now.
[438:42.78]Oh me, oh my, oh... Floyd, come and welcome our boy.
[438:47.08]The balloon is down.
[438:48.06]The internet up.
[438:48.88]Put some Dunkin' in your cup.
[438:50.84]Welcome back, welcome home.
[438:51.97]Remember to leave politics alone.
[438:57.51]Say an opinion.
[438:58.83]Any opinion.
[439:01.35]Reese's is the best fucking candy.
[439:05.55]And I eat full Hershey bars.
[439:08.15]I'm the weirdo.
[439:10.11]I'm the serial killer that eats just the regular default Hershey bar.
[439:16.37]I'm the one guy that you've heard of.
[439:24.33]Burn him.
[439:24.73]Alright, what do you say we get the credits going while I set the video up?
[439:32.60]Thank you to all of the new subs and old subs.
[439:34.74]You guys are amazing.
[439:42.01]Take care, everybody, all of you.
[439:44.78]Let me get this video set up while we watch the list of people.
[439:53.24]Twizzlers or red vines?
[439:55.30]Both of them are disgusting.
[439:58.15]I think licorice is the biggest scam in the history of the world.
[440:00.93]I'd rather eat toothpaste-flavored candy.
[440:03.85]Licorice is awful.
[440:10.54]I don't even think they make it anymore.
[440:14.64]Actually moron.
[440:21.04]Toothpaste tastes good.
[440:24.30]Triangle or rectangle?
[440:25.34]Sandwich slices.
[440:26.10]Rectangle.
[440:33.01]Left or right Twix?
[440:34.65]They're both the same.
[440:37.33]You've been led to believe that they're different.
[440:40.78]From lobbyists.
[440:50.77]Being on payday bars.
[440:52.59]Go back to 1992.
[440:53.03]Now you are mustard.
[440:58.16]Mix them together.
[440:58.98]Add a little sugar.
[441:00.34]And you got yourself a sauce.
[441:09.64]Put the peanut butter or the jelly on top.
[441:12.26]Disgusting jelly out peanut butter and fluff.
[441:14.78]Fluff goes in.
[441:15.62]Excuse me.
[441:16.06]Depending on garlic.
[441:18.57]You should eat garlic all the time.
[441:19.61]It's great for you.
[441:22.75]Okay, so Democrat or Republican?
[441:24.85]He almost had me with that little in-between.
[441:37.51]Man, I used to love your content, but then you said licorice was bad.
[441:40.23]You've changed, man.
[441:43.55]Never give your opinions again.
[441:51.78]Just know, I like want everybody to be, I want everyone to be happy, but it's impossible.
[441:58.94]I want, I want both Twixes to be happy.
[442:05.60]I want Twizzlers to go out of fucking business and for their factory to go under.
[442:12.49]You know, I want everyone to be happy.
[442:25.48]My dad's business.
[442:34.07]My dad's business.
[442:36.43]Oh, I love it.
[442:37.09]By the way, thank you everybody for subbing.
[442:39.79]I am just like fucking around now, but let's watch the video here.
[442:44.22]It's a couple minutes.
[442:52.24]Twizzlers aren't bad.
[442:53.08]They're fine.
[442:59.45]I gotta get the right image here.
[443:05.06]Where is it?
[443:07.70]There it is.
[443:12.25]And then make sure I can actually hear it.
[443:18.31]Jeremy, you're my first Twitch sub ever and you've responded to my messages.
[443:21.35]Thank you.
[443:23.43]If I can catch him by...
[443:25.82]Look, I keep saying this every stream.
[443:28.82]Eventually, you're gonna be the guy that I respond to.
[443:31.20]You're gonna be the guy.
[443:31.82]The one guy.
[443:33.96]Whatever you say, I'm gonna read it eventually.
[443:39.10]Let's watch this.
[443:40.56]You made this song?! !
[443:57.08]Louder
[444:29.45]All my memories, Jerma rumble.
[444:35.09]Fat boy glue man, cheese nips are straight poison.
[444:39.57]You better not gnome me here.
[444:42.05]Remember Dust Bowl, I'm the pirate spy.
[444:47.26]Saving all the seagulls, teardrop in my eye.
[444:52.68]Jerma's gone, took a balloon.
[444:58.86]The fucking lady.
[445:17.30]I hear your voice in the VOD as you play games The stream Discord reminds me of those streams long ago Scrolling through the chat I get the feeling that you should have streamed games yesterday
[445:36.58]Yesterday, Jerma's gone, took a balloon, Las Vegas, California.
[445:53.76]This is actually sad.
[445:57.04]Please come back.
[446:23.55]Oh, there he is!
[446:26.65]I showed it on stream I showed it on stream
[446:57.99]It was so nice.
[446:58.93]It was so... It was so awesome until... I couldn't get rid of it.
[447:10.17]I didn't know what it was.
[447:11.21]Ugh.
[447:18.26]Ugh.
[447:27.30]That was a whole song.
[447:30.58]Is he crying?
[447:31.68]Is he crying?
[447:32.28]Let's prove it.
[447:32.82]Not crying.
[447:33.24]Look.
[447:34.02]Look.
[447:36.90]See?
[447:38.82]I'm not crying.
[447:39.34]I'm fine.
[447:43.09]Red eyes.
[447:45.79]No.
[447:46.99]And I know I'm out of sync.
[447:48.31]I know I am.
[447:48.93]Don't worry.
[447:49.39]I'm aware of it.
[447:53.53]So, that's it.
[447:55.66]Thank you for that video, by the way.
[447:58.62]It was very touching.
[448:01.67]And... Get out.
[448:02.89]Get off.
[448:03.37]Get out of here.
[448:07.07]Not you, me.
[448:07.77]Right at the end here, we had Abnormality gave $5.
[448:11.65]Oh me, oh my.
[448:13.65]We already did that one.
[448:14.91]I don't know why it's showing up here as it was right now.
[448:19.72]But there was ZNiner gave $15.
[448:21.42]$15 from ZNiner.
[448:25.08]Thank you so much.
[448:26.55]Hey, Jerma.
[448:26.89]I see you're finally back at it with streaming.
[448:28.51]Glad you're moving smoothly despite internet problems.
[448:30.41]I actually have a question.
[448:31.99]What happened to ExoskeletonBugMillenniumBoy?
[448:34.41]Did he finally go away or does he still... Also, I had a dream a few weeks back where you played the GTA 5 Spider-Man mod and selected a skin of an alternate Spider-Man.
[448:45.91]You didn't know who it was, so you called him Spider-Man Jex.
[448:48.87]Then you laughed and I woke up.
[448:54.82]Well, exoskeleton bug millennium boy is... He's doing just fine.
[449:03.18]I have a question.
[449:03.76]Cheese nips or Republican?
[449:14.63]Alright.
[449:15.23]Good night, everybody.
[449:17.49]I might see you tomorrow.
[449:19.63]If not, then I'll see you very soon.
[449:22.23]I'll let you know.
[449:23.73]Take care.
[449:24.85]Have a great evening.
[449:26.13]Much love to y'all.
[449:29.02]Sign out.
[449:37.60]What time are you setting the sus to?
[449:41.52]I would just set it to maybe tomorrow.
[449:44.82]Like, oh, maybe today.
[449:46.66]Something like that.
[449:47.16]Maybe.
[449:48.98]I have some things I need to get done around the house, so.
[449:51.90]If I get them done quickly and early, then for sure, I'll be back.
[449:59.43]Take care.
