[00:08.54]I hear it's a good game.
[00:10.46]I hear it's an incredible franchise.
[00:12.85]I haven't played Metal Gear Solid since I was probably 16.
[00:15.93]I played the first one and I played the second one.
[00:19.07]I don't know the story.
[00:20.82]And it's become so complicated and so intertwined at this point, I seriously don't even know where I would even start.
[00:28.08]Dozens of hours of cutscenes, tons of reading.
[00:30.65]I don't got time to read.
[00:31.97]Who's got time to read nowadays, you know?
[00:34.35]So what I did is I picked up this.
[00:38.01]This is, got this online, a comprehensive Metal Gear Neuro Story Electro-Dump.
[00:46.74]They have them for all kinds of things.
[00:47.92]This is for Metal Gear because obviously the story is so complicated like we've talked about.
[00:53.90]So that goes into the CD tray.
[00:56.04]I think it's just a standard disk at Zolle.
[00:58.84]Now we put on the electrodes.
[01:01.65]And that goes there.
[01:02.87]Okay.
[01:06.77]Standard USB.
[01:08.03]It goes right in the back of your computer.
[01:10.45]Just like that.
[01:14.25]That should be it.
[01:17.82]Ow, my teeth!
[01:20.06]Ow!
[01:23.24]Okay.
[01:25.93]Let's all get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5.

[01:32.06]Play button.
[01:34.18]You were injected with Foxtar as a part of this operation.
[01:39.08]There's room for only one snake and one big boss.
[01:42.41]You put a weapon in your mouth.
[01:45.31]You'll ruin your eyes playing so close to the TV.
[01:50.57]Get out of my mind now!
[01:53.96]big boss was the boss and then no the boss was the boss and then big boss big boss man took over because he had to kill her because the third game into the fifth game or the fourth game in the worst and second god damn it I gotta watch it again I gotta start over I gotta start over I'll get it this time because I just it was getting confusing when they were all clones and
