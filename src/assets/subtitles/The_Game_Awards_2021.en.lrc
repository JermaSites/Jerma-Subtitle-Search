[00:08.59]Hello.
[00:10.09]So what's the deal?
[00:17.05]Let's just look.
[00:19.31]Are they going?
[00:19.97]Let's start at 430.
[00:41.90]Okay.
[00:44.40]So, uh, game awards.
[00:46.99]Let me make sure I have this stream ready.
[00:52.49]I saved the game here, so we're good to go.
[00:54.11]It started 20 minutes early.
[01:00.18]It starts in 10 minutes.
[01:03.18]Make the facecam huge.
[01:04.26]Don't worry, there'll be a nice big facecam for you.
[01:13.10]Game is saved.
[01:14.02]Let's get out of here.
[01:14.80]Okay.
[01:20.63]Close that.
[01:23.17]And let's go back over here.
[01:25.05]I put water in my hair.
[01:27.49]I just made myself look like a fucking dickhead.
[01:36.36]I tried to do the thing, but now I look way, way worse than I did 10 minutes ago.
[01:45.22]I just need to dry.
[01:46.14]I look like fucking dad.
[01:48.02]I look like dad.
[01:49.58]You know what I mean?
[01:50.04]Like, this is... I put way too much water here and none here.
[01:53.45]Alright, what do you got, Game Award?
[02:02.95]Show me.
[02:08.99]Where is it?
[02:10.87]My fucking... This hair sucks.
[02:16.05]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[02:17.33]Alright, we're... Oh, sorry, I muted.
[02:28.88]Alright, game awards.
[02:31.61]Here it is.
[02:32.57]There's the stream.
[02:34.93]I gotta change my... When you order... Hold on, let me see if I can get this right.
[02:42.45]When you order a crispy chicken sandwich from McDonald's, you have the most tender, juicy crispy chicken sandwich that's ever been made.
[02:51.26]Any McDonald's crispy chicken sandwich on the app, you get a free medium fries and soft drink, which is great.
[02:57.14]Did I get it right?
[02:57.60]Because after all, who orders just the sandwich anyway?
[03:02.42]I think I got it pretty close.
[03:07.94]What are you talking about?
[03:08.86]Wait, did that not come through?
[03:09.76]Why do I have three bug legs on my head here?
[03:14.24]There's a spider on my head.
[03:16.28]There's a big spider right here, and I'm just gonna let him stay.
[03:21.54]I look like the fucking guy in the crime show that they, like, put against the wall.
[03:26.32]Hey, man, where's the boss?
[03:30.44]Just to fuck up, cop.
[03:31.88]Like, I have that, like, stupid, like, I'm the guy that goes against a brick wall by the cop, by the detective.
[03:41.07]okay um here we go McDonald's crispy chicken sandwich is it I don't want you to see that alright oh it starts soon this is actually for the pre-show is this for the pre-show this is what I'm gonna do
[04:16.03]Alright, show starts soon.
[04:20.65]How do I get rid of that?
[04:21.53]I want to get this off the screen.
[04:25.25]Can I disable this?
[04:28.48]Bathrobe.
[04:29.02]I don't have the bathrobe anymore.
[04:30.54]It's gone.
[04:31.14]It's been lost.
[04:32.06]I look really sweaty.
[04:38.43]Like really sweaty.
[04:45.57]I want to get this extension off.
[04:53.50]Info.
[04:54.14]How do I turn this off?
[04:54.78]I want to, like, close this.
[05:01.16]Control.
[05:06.90]Control.
[05:07.33]What?
[05:07.65]Control plus?
[05:08.79]How do I do that?
[05:11.19]Do I do control plus?
[05:12.21]Yes.
[05:15.16]That didn't do anything.
[05:15.82]How do I get this off?
[05:21.08]Oh, there we go.
[05:30.00]I don't want visible.
[05:31.02]Turn it off.
[05:32.42]Okay, there we go.
[05:32.92]Now it should be good to go.
[05:42.87]Okay, here we go.
[05:44.09]It's time for the game awards.
[05:52.10]I'm so excited.
[05:53.98]You have no idea.
[05:56.32]I played, I think, one game that came out in 2021, so my opinion you absolutely should listen to.
[06:01.61]I gotta change the category, too.
[06:02.61]One sec.
[06:09.45]One sec.
[06:12.23]Starts in 8 minutes.
[06:13.79]We'll talk in a second.
[06:14.99]I can just get stuff ready.
[06:17.81]Why is this showing up here?
[06:27.06]Make sure it's on HD.
[06:29.72]HD.
[06:30.14]Okay, good.
[06:36.02]You're stalling.
[06:36.94]I'm not stalling.
[06:45.26]Sounds good.
[06:46.64]Change the category to... I gotta say, I'm streaming the Game Awards, alright?
[06:53.47]Live from my apartment.
[06:59.36]Here you go.
[07:16.93]And then just chatting, I guess.
[07:22.64]You guys are going to love this title, I think.
[07:35.41]Just turn the stream off.
[07:39.24]I'm going to look like it's squirrely.
[07:49.67]Let's make it seem like I don't know this is happening and like somebody would be like, dude, please let me help you.
[08:03.62]I think this would be like a dude.
[08:08.67]You look like this is a journal.
[08:10.21]You're a game journalist now.
[08:13.71]We get the chat in the right spot.
[08:21.93]I want to be able to see you guys.
[08:22.77]See what you guys have to say.
[08:24.05]Alright, so.
[08:28.03]My favorite game that came out this year.
[08:32.35]Let's see if I can name a game that came out in 2021.
[08:34.54]Resident Evil 8.
[08:38.80]Resident Evil 8.
[08:53.71]WarioWare for the Nintendo Switch, which I thought was a piece of shit.
[09:07.60]Deltarune.
[09:08.30]Well, Deltarune is... Did you see that?
[09:10.64]Hold on.
[09:20.37]Ahem.
[09:21.19]I should just, like, get gel and just plaster this down.
[09:24.67]Pok√©mon Snap?
[09:30.51]Yeah, but I played that for, like, an hour.
[09:35.51]Hitman... Hitman 3 came out this year?
[09:37.49]I have to get reminded of what even came out.
[09:38.91]I don't... I actually don't remember what came out.
[09:40.51]I'm gonna turn it up.
[09:44.65]Is that as long as it goes?
[09:57.31]Volume mixer.
[10:06.60]This is up.
[10:07.10]This is going to be loud.
[10:09.64]Be careful.
[10:10.20]I'm warning you right now.
[10:11.82]Turn down a little bit because you're going to get a window sound.
[10:14.10]It's going to be loud.
[10:16.67]Turn your volume down.
[10:17.43]I'm not kidding.
[10:19.43]Turn your volume down.
[10:20.11]3, 2, 1.
[10:29.01]Here we go.
[10:31.17]Cam works.
[10:37.24]We look alright.
[10:44.94]It's too loud.
[10:45.80]I'll fix it.
[10:49.11]Okay, so what's your favorite game that came out this year?
[10:53.37]What's your favorite game that came out this year?
[10:56.53]My favorite game that came out this year is probably... It's probably Resident Evil 8.
[11:02.51]Is that even nominated for anything?
[11:07.31]No More Heroes 3?
[11:07.99]Yeah, but it's not going to get nominated.
[11:11.05]I don't even know what the nominees are.
[11:12.25]I haven't even seen the nominees.
[11:14.87]I have not looked at one nominee for the Game Awards.
[11:19.04]I don't even know what's nominated.
[11:27.43]I'm going in without any knowledge at all.
[11:36.81]Undertale.
[11:38.99]Oh, that's the one that goes... Orza came out.
[12:00.96]B-Boneworks?
[12:02.42]Boneworks is like 2019.
[12:03.00]This is 20- I know, I know, like 2020- I- Okay, I- this has to change because I hate it.
[12:10.82]Wait, it just got more- it got evolved.
[12:27.71]It looks like my- my hair looks like a plant that needs water.
[12:31.59]Like, I need to water this head.
[12:36.71]This actually is going to distract me over the course of this entire broadcast.
[12:40.83]Two minutes!
[12:41.73]Two minutes till we find out who won the Nintendo Multiplayer Live Streaming of the Year!
[13:03.19]Go take a shower and come back.
[13:10.51]Nah.
[13:12.65]Nah, fuck that.
[13:23.29]What?
[13:25.21]Anybody excited for anything?
[13:27.51]Is anybody here excited?
[13:33.96]I don't know what it is.
[13:34.54]I don't know.
[13:34.94]Okay, this music is supposed to be hyping me up right now.
[13:38.97]But I kind of feel like I'm at the dentist.
[13:42.61]Like, if your dentist was playing this music, it'd be like, I'm at the dentist.
[13:46.49]I don't really care.
[13:47.39]Like, this is weird to play at the dentist in the waiting room.
[13:52.33]Like, I'm not excited at all for this.
[13:53.83]I'm not excited at all for the dentist.
[13:55.85]They're the same place to me right now.
[14:04.36]Can you imagine if a dog waiting room had this though?
[14:06.40]That would be so awesome.
[14:14.40]Just waiting for your appointment.
[14:21.33]There's gonna be game announcements?
[14:25.55]I look like 10 years older with this.
[14:27.21]It's gone.
[14:35.81]Alright, here, let's go.
[14:37.37]15 seconds, let's go.
[14:39.67]I'm probably gonna have to, I'm gonna do cam in and cam out.
[14:43.50]Welcome to the Game Awards 2021.
[14:47.02]First big reveal probably coming up right now.
[14:49.56]Get yourself strapped in here.

[16:12.90]What is this?
[16:40.23]Alright!

[16:46.23]One of those gray hairs went in my eye.
[16:58.18]Alright.
[17:00.30]It looks cute.
[17:01.08]Alright.
[17:06.63]Tunic.
[17:09.92]My eyes just hurt.
[17:19.09]First award of the evening, and I really can't think of a better one to start us off.
[17:23.07]We want you to be negative?
[17:24.99]This category highlights the very best of what gaming can be.
[17:28.51]I'm not going to be negative just to be negative.
[17:30.52]...challenge the player on more than just skill, exploring all the corners of the human condition.
[17:36.28]These are the games that remind us, in a medium where you can be anything, be good.
[17:40.84]The audio's fucked up?
[17:42.98]Here are the nominees of the Games for Impact Award.
[17:46.86]Why is the audio scuffed?
[17:48.34]Refresh the stream on my end.
[17:49.22]Wait, are you guys being serious?
[18:02.27]Thank you so much.
[18:04.29]I can't believe we won.
[18:06.43]As devs, we work on games for years at a time before we share with the world.
[18:10.29]And by the time we do, the world's often different from when we started the adventure.
[18:14.29]I have low latency on you.
[18:15.87]For me, then, with Life is Strange True Colors, it's not just about finishing a game in quarantine.
[18:21.67]Who could have predicted what kind of an impact a game about human connection would make in 2021?
[18:27.01]So from everyone at Deck Nine and our partners at Square Enix, thank you so much.
[18:31.54]Congratulations.
[18:36.26]I'll tell you, if I ever win one of these for any reason, I'm just going to fall sprint onto the stage, grab the award, and just keep going.
[18:42.26]And go out the exit.
[18:42.92]The whole time, I would just be going, Thank you!
[18:44.32]Thank you!
[18:44.70]Thank you!
[18:45.08]It would be so cringy.
[18:45.96]People would probably fucking hate me.
[19:05.01]I'm never going to win an award by the way let's be really clear about this gaming bundle we'll be right back with more they just saw those eyes and they're like don't ever let that guy in the building hey game that's like exact that's exactly what would happen powers and we'll be watching the game awards streaming to you on verizon's 5g network yeah come check it out we're gonna party hardy until we can't hardly party and there's gonna be some surprise already hardy on the way I think one of their names is Jack harlow yeah I think one yeah one is gi carlo yeah Jack harlow
[19:32.87]So, is it still pre-show?
[19:33.59]Discover.
[19:33.83]Risk of Rain 2.
[19:34.19]Risk of Rain 3?
[20:00.38]No, they would still make it.
[20:01.70]They were in the middle of developing this.
[20:03.14]30% off.
[20:21.43]That's why the camera's never on.
[20:23.91]You understand?
[20:24.47]Okay, the reason why the camera's never on is because there are like five to ten frog, full mouth frog burps.
[20:31.44]Every probably 20, 30 minutes.
[20:32.88]I'm serious.
[20:33.38]That's why I don't do it.
[20:35.68]Like, you probably have seen like on the last couple days.
[20:43.04]What's this?
[20:44.52]Start at max level.
[20:48.02]Well, that's just unfair, ain't it?
[20:51.05]Instantly unlock all end game modes.
[20:54.58]Don't even play the game.
[20:58.38]Just unlock everything, get to max level, and uninstall.
[21:04.05]This audio is kind of fucked up.
[21:09.06]Yeah, the music sounds like it's coming through like a kazoo.
[21:12.18]Pause and unpause.
[21:12.56]King of Fighters!
[21:13.04]I can't believe it.
[21:37.12]King of Fighters, are you serious?
[21:38.90]Pog!
[21:40.94]What?
[21:45.14]Are you kidding me?
[21:45.94]I... Actually, this is probably going to be kind of cool.
[21:52.06]I remember King of Fighters.
[22:10.15]Uh-oh.
[22:13.07]And now I need to refresh it.
[22:14.25]That's pretty cool.
[22:18.87]Wait, there have been 15 of these games?
[22:21.55]There's actually been 15?
[22:22.19]Holy shit.
[22:22.97]That's insane.
[22:45.07]Turn off low latency, it'll help.
[22:53.05]What's this?
[23:13.76]It's the, um... Are you guessing Among Us?
[23:36.14]Somebody just put a really, really gross plate of food in front of Gordon Ramsay.
[23:41.94]It's that same sound.
[23:47.01]I remember the Kartoba.
[23:50.21]An island in a dune sea.
[23:53.32]I remember the Guidestone.
[23:56.94]The Diamond Shard.
[23:57.84]No, no, he's not the guy with the chainsaw.
[24:00.16]The Sisters of Alcoa.
[24:01.92]No, I mean the sound effect.
[24:07.29]The Song of the Core.
[24:12.43]I remember opening the gates.
[24:22.39]I just ran out of water.
[24:27.48]Alright.
[24:54.09]Alright, this looks alright.
[25:05.69]What is it?
[25:07.53]Super Mario Galaxy Odyssey 3.
[25:10.55]I'm sorry.
[25:10.95]I'll shut up.
[25:13.13]But not long enough.
[25:26.21]Okay.
[25:27.27]Homeworld 3.
[25:28.13]What is Homeworld?
[25:31.94]Homeworld.
[25:32.40]Have a game fun?
[25:40.16]Should I play it?
[25:43.61]And now I have the honor of announcing the winners for four esports categories.
[25:48.28]Is that the same icon?
[25:49.34]For best esports athlete, here are the nominees.
[25:51.28]The award trophy is the game's logo?
[25:53.42]And the game award goes to... Simple.

[25:59.98]And now, here are your nominees for best esports team.
[26:04.45]And the game award goes to... Nadis Vincere.

[26:10.08]I don't really watch that much esports, but cool.
[26:12.52]And the game award goes to Koma.
[26:13.27]Congratulations, Koma.
[26:23.30]I watch speedrunners, but not like teams.

[28:40.99]It's not smite.
[28:43.19]What are you talking about?
[28:48.67]I'm kind of interested.
[29:35.73]Why does this kind of look like ass?
[29:50.57]I don't mean the game.
[29:51.35]I mean, I don't like broadcast.
[29:58.03]Because you're watching in 480?
[29:59.13]I am definitely not watching in 480.

[31:37.51]And this is the back of it.
[31:38.85]That's pretty much it.

[31:40.85]We'll be hanging out with myself and Nate Hill tonight.
[31:43.87]Thanks to the 50 subs.
[31:45.23]Make sure you come through.
[31:47.06]It's going to be all over Verizon's 5G network.
[31:50.40]It's going to be insane.
[31:51.54]A whole network?
[31:52.14]Wait, what?
[31:52.72]So make sure you tune in and hang out with us.
[31:55.12]See you there.
[31:57.72]And now, guess what I have?
[32:00.79]Does that mean that it's going to be on all of our phones?
[32:02.62]Steaming hot.
[32:04.26]I don't know the word steaming hot to me.
[32:10.54]Doesn't sound right.
[32:13.31]The creature wanders restlessly through the darkness.
[32:16.83]Silver light illuminates the land and the mountains.
[32:20.77]And with an entranced roar, it shows its true form.
[32:31.57]It's an ad showcase?
[32:32.33]Yeah, it's the Game Awards.
[32:33.95]They... The whole thing is to premiere new stuff and show ads.
[32:39.67]Is it Monster Hunter?
[32:45.57]Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak.
[32:48.63]I got the one on the Switch and I gave up in 30 minutes because I was sick of doing the tutorial.
[32:56.24]After the third hour of the one on Switch, I was like, I don't even want to play this anymore.
[33:05.31]I'm sure it's fun.
[33:05.77]I promise I'm not bored!
[33:14.02]I promise!
[33:15.04]I promise I'm very excited!
[33:27.27]Holy shit, was that- how much is that?
[33:30.01]Is that 30 pounds?
[33:30.53]What's going on?
[33:31.55]We threw a car?
[33:32.11]What the fuck was that?
[34:03.98]What the fuck?
[34:05.80]This is insane So what is um
[34:23.96]It's John Tucker Must Die, but no, no, no, no, no.
[34:26.44]What is it?
[34:27.58]Scott Pilgrim... Scott Pilgrim Nukes the Universe?
[34:30.43]What is it?
[34:31.27]What's that game?
[34:33.75]Scott Pilgrim versus the world.
[34:35.01]Okay.
[34:35.27]That actually looked kind of cool.
[34:36.93]That was all over the place.
[34:39.01]It looked cool.
[35:01.32]You know what kept me alive all these years?
[35:04.50]Upkeep, maintenance, vigilance.
[35:08.56]Of course, all that means nothing when hell's gates start spewing shit everywhere.
[35:14.43]Alright.
[35:17.73]Alright.
[35:23.49]A lot of particle effects.
[35:27.09]Again, I will make this statement again.
[35:28.67]I want less particle effects, not more.
[35:34.77]And they're always neon colored.
[35:38.87]They're always neon blue, neon purple, neon green.
[35:44.24]They have to be bright neon colored.
[35:46.08]There doesn't need to be bloom inside of your particle effects bloom.
[35:53.32]I hate the neon particle explosion shit.
[35:56.45]That drives me nuts.
[35:57.31]Oh, you didn't see that coming.
[36:01.26]I don't know about you, but I am groovy for more content.
[36:05.02]Here's a new world premiere from Perfect Worlds.
[36:07.50]What?
[36:11.41]A new world premiere?
[36:16.87]Ah, good morning, Death.
[36:19.19]What a lovely day to be alive, wouldn't you say?
[36:23.49]Ready for another busy week in the afterlife?
[36:27.96]Oh, my.
[36:29.18]Busy may have been an understatement.
[36:33.74]Evidently, your sorrows have been working overtime.
[36:37.56]Oh, my.
[36:38.22]Game you play is death?
[36:39.28]Wow, that is truly unprofessional.
[36:41.66]Now, death, we talked about this.
[36:43.73]Try not to lose your temper again.
[36:53.94]Maybe it's about time your supporters showed you some respect.
[36:58.28]OK, you know what they say.
[37:00.02]If you want things done right, it's best to do them yourself, alright?
[37:07.05]Oh yo.
[37:10.93]This looks pretty great actually.
[37:27.53]Who made this?
[37:28.01]This is the Hollow Knight devs?
[37:38.20]Have a nice death.
[37:42.70]That looked pretty awesome, actually.
[37:44.00]I'll be honest.
[37:44.48]Hi, everybody.
[37:45.06]I'm Ariel Power.
[37:45.90]The Game of War is coming up.
[37:47.66]We're watching and hosting a watch party together on Nate Hill's channel.
[37:51.98]Yeah, we're going to be watching on twitch.tv/nadehill and it's all powered by Verizon 5G.

[38:00.95]So come by and check it out.
[38:02.41]Come through.
[38:02.95]See you guys.
[38:05.09]And now I have the pleasure of presenting the Game Award for Best Audio Design.
[38:09.96]When your medium relies so heavily on being successful in putting the player inside your story...
[38:15.76]Oh wait, I get to be alive for this one.
[38:17.38]That's audio design.
[38:35.15]Forza!
[38:37.01]Oh my god.
[38:39.73]That's such a surprise to me.
[38:42.55]Thank you so much.
[38:44.90]Our audio team throughout the development of Forza Horizon 5 have just been so passionate about everything they do.
[38:50.50]There's this relentless appetite to produce an audio experience of the absolute highest quality.
[38:55.92]This award, it really does mean the world to us.
[38:59.04]That's really- Forza sounds great.
[39:00.54]The cars sound- I've just queued it up for- I'm sorry.
[39:03.16]Forza's actually fucking aw- like very technically incredible game.
[39:07.04]Did you guys know Jim Carrey's here?
[39:25.29]Jim Carrey's here somewhere.
[39:26.71]No, not here.
[39:27.27]He's here.
[39:27.55]Why are you not there?
[39:28.95]Why would I be here?
[39:30.67]It's for the new Sonic movie?
[39:47.85]I instantly fell in love with the project and it's stunning.
[39:50.15]Don't call Jim Carrey at 3am.
[39:51.41]I hope he does something funny.
[39:52.43]Music?
[40:23.50]This is actually really like good music.
[40:25.28]Somebody just said Jim Carrey is smoking hot and like it's kind of throwing me off.
[40:55.68]This kind of feels like the music on a Disneyland ride.
[40:59.68]You guys ever been on Soarin'?
[41:01.86]That's what it sounds like.
[41:08.89]Which is a compliment, by the way.
[41:10.09]That's not negative.
[41:28.26]Sounds good.
[41:34.32]Oh, I was going to catch it in my mouth.
[41:38.10]Planet of Lana.
[41:41.86]An off-Earth odyssey.
[42:02.24]Alright.
[42:05.40]Alright.
[42:06.24]Alright.
[42:08.32]Looks alright.
[42:10.88]Is he baked?
[42:12.20]Well, according to my calculations.
[42:14.59]Here it is.
[42:15.25]I can't believe it.
[42:16.11]We are already here.
[42:17.23]We are down to our final world premiere of our pre-show.
[42:21.03]I gotta be careful though.
[42:21.85]A special game announcement.
[42:23.89]Something you did not see coming.
[42:26.38]I gotta be careful.
[42:29.50]No, I'm just kidding.
[42:35.64]Persona Persona's starting to turn into Street Fighters.
[42:42.45]Or like Dragon Ball games.
[42:43.45]Persona 4 What was this one?
[43:05.72]There's like two or three adjectives after the game.
[43:10.43]Persona 4.
[43:11.41]Explosive.
[43:12.03]Destructive.
[43:13.73]Intuition.
[43:15.89]Persona 4 Arena Ultimax.
[43:18.95]What is, is that, is there already one?
[43:22.14]I'm so confused.
[43:28.71]Persona 4 Arena Ultimate.
[43:31.41]Is it a... It was a PS3 game.
[43:32.29]I know Persona is like a beloved franchise, but there's a lot of weird side things that confuse me.
[43:58.57]The remake of a fighting game.
[43:59.35]That's cool.
[43:59.65]Is this stream going to... Do I have to be careful of DMCA again?
[44:33.93]Here we go.
[44:40.99]I am the monster you created.
[44:44.17]Is this live?
[44:47.83]You ripped out all my parts.
[44:51.28]Of course it is.
[44:52.14]What am I talking about?
[44:53.18]And worst of all, for me to live, I gotta kill the part of me that saw that I needed you more.
[45:15.51]That's from Arcane.
[45:16.63]No, that's not Jim Carrey.
[45:21.65]Please.
[45:57.59]This fog the smoke I was meant to be yours
[46:28.95]some dense gas I told you I feel weird just sitting here on camera just sitting doing nothing I said this every year
[47:04.17]an incredibly talented person not this guy he not me I shouldn't even be on screen right now that was so good
[47:32.48]Like, I... Like, oh, this guy's probably spent, like, fucking hundreds of thousands of hours crafting the ability to be able to play like this.
[47:39.14]On stage.
[47:40.34]At the peak of his musical talent.
[47:45.08]Is Resident Evil 9 gonna get announced today?
[47:47.78]I don't belong here right now.
[48:10.62]That was unbelievable.
[48:12.37]Actually, it was really, really good.
[48:13.82]That was really good.
[48:25.86]Why don't we just go ahead and tell her that we're divorcing?
[48:28.38]My daughter is not a weapon.
[48:31.29]Pick him away.
[48:32.55]The fate of the free-thinking world is in your hands.
[48:36.85]I know you've been meeting with her behind my back.
[48:39.13]I loved Resident Evil 8.
[48:40.75]I know people didn't like it.
[48:41.74]Human life.
[48:46.52]Anti-death.
[48:47.76]Oh, no.
[48:50.69]I sense suffering here, spirit.
[48:53.94]Keep it right here.
[48:56.06]You have to work on it.
[48:57.94]You can't just give up.
[48:59.84]We're never getting out of here.
[49:02.24]Let's see how special you are.
[49:05.91]I have been doomed to a life of solitude.
[49:08.09]Rule with strength, but understand suffering.
[49:17.76]It will not be fine.
[49:20.18]It will be fantastico!
[49:26.16]I guess it's my time to shine.
[49:28.90]You gave it a six.
[49:31.56]I did?
[49:33.10]God gives victory to the lions.
[49:35.72]No, I didn't.
[49:36.24]When I look into your eyes, I see lions.
[49:40.18]I did?
[49:40.81]No way.
[49:44.57]That's embarrassing because I'm talking about how much I loved it.
[49:50.98]Yes.
[49:53.10]You want to stay a team?
[49:59.47]Enjoy the beach.
[50:02.35]One revolution was enough.
[50:06.74]I'm breaking this loop.
[50:13.27]Welcome to the Game Awards 2021.
[50:16.92]Now, here's your host, Geoff Keighley.
[50:21.62]It's like pulled a muscle in my chest.
[50:22.90]Hello, everybody.
[50:25.12]I'm serious.
[50:27.59]We're here.
[50:28.49]We made it.
[50:32.81]All the stupid things that that apparently.
[50:34.95]This is the Game Awards Video Games Biggest Night live in person.
[50:42.89]Look at all that.
[50:43.53]That's a lot.
[50:45.23]Holy shit, that's really decorated.
[50:47.11]That show is supposed to be really good, isn't it?
[50:51.20]I've seen the first two episodes.
[51:05.94]Well, I got to say, it feels so incredible to be back here on stage at Microsoft Theater and streaming live to tens of millions of you around the world.
[51:16.86]This is a night for the fans.
[51:19.69]And, you know, the games we love are nothing without amazing developers.
[51:24.97]And that's why we do this show, to honor the creators of games.
[51:29.27]So welcome to all of you.
[51:30.49]I didn't read the Harry Potter books either.
[51:32.23]And I watched the movies.
[51:33.65]I'm not going to play League ever.
[51:37.19]So good to see everyone.
[51:38.55]But you know, we gotta be real and we can't ignore the headlines that are out there.
[51:42.88]Game creators need to be supported by the companies that employ them.
[51:46.92]I think we all agree with that.
[51:52.36]So let me just say this before we get to any of the news or announcements or awards.
[51:56.41]We should not and will not tolerate any abuse, harassment, and predatory practices by anyone, including our online communities.
[52:08.95]We all love games, and if we want this industry to keep growing, we must build an even brighter and more inclusive future.
[52:17.60]The games we play and the games that we love, they teach us that we can impact the world around us.
[52:24.67]And tonight, I call on everyone to do their part to build a better, safer video game industry.
[52:31.71]Speak out online.
[52:33.41]Vote with your time and with your dollars.
[52:36.19]Empower these world builders who are creating the future of all entertainment.
[52:42.09]And believe me, the future you're about to see looks absolutely incredible.
[52:48.13]I thought he was gonna say the star of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
[52:49.97]Wait, really?
[52:50.47]Oh shit, that's awesome.
[52:51.37]I love this guy.
[53:17.20]Independence allows a game to go a little bit more wild, become a bit stranger, and the freedom to break boundaries.
[53:24.52]No more chapstick.
[53:25.08]Put it away.
[53:25.32]Tonight's radically creative nominees for best independent game demonstrate excellence achieved through great risk.
[53:32.50]Here are the nominees for best independent game.
[53:36.78]Alright, people are going to eat each other up for this one.
[53:40.12]Look, I know this sounds weird, but the day is repeating itself.
[53:46.03]Didn't play it.
[53:50.80]Didn't play it.
[53:55.74]Didn't play it.
[54:00.89]Didn't play it.
[54:03.01]Fuck.
[54:04.25]What am I even doing here?
[54:07.37]Why am I here?
[54:09.15]I shouldn't be live.
[54:11.79]Her inscription was very good.
[54:14.09]It would be inscription if it was me.
[54:16.17]Kena, Bridge of Spirits.
[54:21.86]I actually did not play any of these games.
[54:27.23]Alright.
[54:29.03]I mean this and I mean it.
[54:30.49]I mean it.
[54:32.11]I mean it.
[54:34.01]If I have not played at least three games that are nominated throughout this entire broadcast, I will gift a hundred community subs.
[54:42.72]Like, come on, dude.
[54:44.68]Are you serious?
[54:47.06]I have to have played at least three of these.
[54:49.68]Well, yeah, you know, it was an amazing journey to get here.
[54:53.34]Took a lot of hard work from an awesome team.
[54:55.67]A few of them are here today, but just can't say enough about the amazing people we worked with to make this game and to make the vision come true.
[55:03.83]Have to take our partners at Sony, who kind of believed in us from the very beginning.
[55:07.65]I don't think I played more than three.
[55:09.19]And all the guys at Epic who just have been there from the beginning.
[55:11.67]So...
[55:12.59]Thank you, everyone, and this is a great honor.
[55:14.65]Oh, I said 100 subs, not adding anything to the debt.
[55:25.09]You said you played one.
[55:25.81]I know I played Resident Evil 8, so that's one.
[55:27.11]Congratulations, guys.
[55:28.33]Alright, now it's time to look into the future.
[55:31.40]Two years ago, this team announced their game on this very stage.
[55:34.64]Now they're back with the first gameplay reveal.
[55:37.51]When I saw this, I could not believe it was actual gameplay.
[55:41.21]But it is captured by the team in-game this past weekend.
[55:44.53]Sit back and get ready to experience a new level of cinematic immersion.
[55:54.06]Okay, we'll see.
[55:57.90]And she said...
[56:00.65]Alright.
[56:01.61]Oh, it's this game with the real faces.

[63:47.92]What is it?
[64:11.01]Alright.
[64:19.07]Is it a tower defense game?
[64:43.88]Imagine if it was a top-down, just tower defense game.
[64:51.15]Star Wars Eclipse TD.
[64:58.37]Okay, well, I don't really know exactly what that is, but...
[65:05.57]I saw lightsabers.
[65:07.67]Although I did play that Last Jedi game.
[65:12.50]No, the last Star Wars game.
[65:14.10]I lost me.
[65:25.85]Alright, there are many more game announcements to come, trust me, as well as awards.
[65:30.39]All night, we are partnering with YouTube Shorts.
[65:32.29]If you have a favorite nominee tonight that doesn't win, let us know your thoughts by posting a YouTube short with the hashtag GotShorted and head to the YouTube Gaming Twitter handle to find out how to get your very own salty consolation gift.
[65:45.74]Alright, right now, it's time to meet our first global gaming citizen, a program we started back in 2018 to turn our air over to individuals...
[65:54.43]Where's Hitman?
[65:55.91]Is Hitman actually going to be here?
[65:58.66]That'd be cool if they announced something.
[66:01.47]I love Hitman.
[66:04.84]I grew up playing games.
[66:06.38]Games was as a little kid, as a little gay boy.
[66:10.52]I just want VR Star Wars so bad.
[66:13.46]Games gave me a place to feel safe and to be myself.
[66:17.82]Ever since that one with the joystick in the arcades.
[66:21.95]You know what I'm talking about?
[66:27.41]It was like you control the TIE fighter and then you fight Darth Vader.
[66:30.45]It was a big arcade cabinet reference to be inspired To build up all this drag this insane costume all this makeup all this hair, but feel powerful Because as a kid I felt weak I felt like the outsider
[66:43.97]Now let's run to the exit.
[66:45.39]When you find people that have similar interests, you can be yourself.
[66:48.49]So close.
[66:49.67]You don't have to be worried about all these things.
[66:52.15]Yeah, relax, guys.
[66:53.09]Come on.
[67:50.14]I gotta turn my Switch on, it's been a long time.
[67:55.48]Besides, uh, what was the last thing I played on Switch?
[67:57.73]What was the last video game that I actually played?
[68:06.65]What was the last video game I actually played?
[68:11.38]Besides, uh, ports of 20-year-old video games.
[68:15.00]Those don't count.
[68:33.12]That just like scared me.
[68:34.10]I was like, what the fuck?
[68:38.39]Yeah, we've got some stuff on sale.
[68:40.73]But let's all take a breather while we give away hundreds of free game codes.
[68:44.77]This is our small way of saying thank you for playing our games for the past 35 years.
[68:52.13]Yeah, am I high?
[68:52.71]I feel like... I feel like I'm the only one seeing this.
[68:54.43]Bethesda.
[68:54.81]Are they going to show...
[69:21.10]Are they going to show... Whatever.
[69:21.88]That ended weirdly.
[69:22.54]What are they codes for?
[69:23.80]I don't know.
[69:24.40]Try them on Steam.
[69:25.64]I would try them on Steam.
[69:56.25]It doesn't work on Steam?
[69:59.91]Maybe it was just a laugh out loud joke.
[70:13.24]Alright, don't tell me what was nominated for Game of the Year.
[70:17.32]I don't want you to tell me.
[70:18.24]I don't want to know.
[70:30.13]Play for free February 11th.
[70:31.73]Is anybody else just waiting for like an evil villain guy?
[70:57.01]to be just like a normal person.
[71:01.03]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[71:02.23]Wait a minute.
[71:02.61]Whoa, that was Lost Ark?
[71:04.40]That was Lost Ark?
[71:07.28]That was Lost Ark.
[71:08.00]I've been waiting for that game for like 25 years.
[71:09.98]That game, I want to play that.
[71:11.42]I actually really am interested in that.
[71:12.66]That game, what is it out?
[71:13.99]English?
[71:16.31]Holy shit, I wanna play that.
[71:17.03]That game got announced when my hairline was here.
[71:33.47]So, I've been waiting for that for a long time.
[71:34.65]Ooh!
[71:34.75]Non-leak!
[72:03.39]Watch it be something just so... It's gonna be Batman.
[72:06.48]My daughter, a new threat comes to our shores.
[72:11.54]And I must call you home.
[72:15.16]Restore what has been broken.
[72:17.16]Batman vs. Superman, the experience.
[72:19.54]You put on a VR helmet, you're Batman, you just get the shit kicked out of you.
[72:24.55]You are a hero.
[72:25.25]With haptic feedback all over your chest and shit.
[72:27.45]But you can be more.
[72:30.31]You can be a leader.
[72:42.29]Gameplay?
[72:42.87]Gameplay?
[72:43.47]Any gameplay?
[72:44.05]Anything at all besides... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:49.26]Monolith.
[72:49.96]Monolith, monolith, monolith, monolith, monolith, monolith, monolith.
[72:53.02]Monolith?
[72:53.82]Monolith.
[72:54.62]I am... That's... That company's fucking awesome.
[73:04.75]That's a big deal to me.
[73:05.95]I love that studio.
[73:06.81]Shadow of Mordor.
[73:07.55]Shadow of War.
[73:07.95]Gotham City Imposters.
[73:20.90]Fear?
[73:21.26]I am actually, I want to see more of that game.
[73:24.40]I'm very excited.
[73:25.68]I love that studio.
[73:27.02]I've seen the worst parts of you.
[73:29.70]To rebuild Paradise, the cost will be blood.
[73:34.93]Eight geniuses who painted up a prison and named it freedom.
[73:39.51]You escaped my little brother's idiot games.
[73:42.13]That one, that one, that one.
[73:44.77]Everybody chose to be your cult.
[73:47.37]Don't hide your true self.
[73:54.18]Lady Demetra Sue.
[73:55.00]And the game award for best performance goes to... Maggie Robertson.
[74:02.11]There it is.
[74:03.35]We got, yes, we got one.
[74:05.79]Resident Evil.
[74:15.58]We got one.
[74:18.68]Let's fucking go.
[74:25.39]Do a line.
[74:26.51]Do a line.
[74:26.97]Do a line.
[74:27.55]I keep repeating myself.
[74:28.29]I'm just repeating words.
[74:29.07]No.
[74:47.23]dynamic characters, of which Lady D is but one.
[74:50.51]And to Rosanna and DJ with The Workhouse, to Steve Kniebly, our amazing cinematics director.
[74:55.72]I've said this before, but I'm going to say it again because I'm a broken record.
[74:58.72]You took a chance on me when you hired me for this role, and in doing so, you have changed my life.
[75:05.74]Being a part of this game, playing this role, and becoming a member of this amazing community has changed my life.
[75:12.01]So thank you so, so much.
[75:19.13]That was great.
[75:20.23]She was great in Resident Evil.
[75:23.65]She nailed it.
[75:24.09]See, my favorite game of the year is gonna sweep.
[75:29.04]We're gonna get a clean sweep of every award.
[75:32.00]Come to a story with hopes and expectations.
[75:36.14]Looking for an answer.
[75:41.85]Sometimes it would be better to live with that hope without ever finding the story.
[75:52.72]This is not the story you want it to be.
[75:59.45]Wrestling Empire is not nominated.
[76:01.29]Oh, shit.
[76:02.91]That actually might be my favorite game of the year.
[76:04.59]You're right.
[76:05.83]This story is a monster.
[76:10.49]A real face game.
[76:11.45]Monsters wear many faces.
[76:23.69]Here's the new trend in gaming.
[76:25.43]We have a real face.
[76:27.15]Gotcha!
[76:28.05]Alright, I'm now joined by my man Sam Lake.
[76:30.97]Sam, thank you for coming all the way over to Finland for this.
[76:33.50]This is so exciting.
[76:35.08]Alan Wake 2.
[76:35.84]It's been a decade.
[76:36.78]Fans have been asking you for it.
[76:38.02]Why is now the right time to bring him back?
[76:39.96]Well, Jeff, first of all... Didn't Alan Wake get removed from Steam?
[76:43.58]It's been raining here in Los Angeles today.
[76:47.10]It's on us.
[76:48.10]Like fiction leaking out into reality.
[76:51.04]So sorry.
[76:52.39]Didn't it get removed from Steam because it had copyrighted music in it or something?
[76:54.97]Over 10 years.
[76:57.12]One thing to make this streaming of making it, we've been iterating on the concept and we know fans have been asking for it.
[77:03.50]We've been a bit protective.
[77:05.11]We knew this is going to be a pretty scary experience.
[77:08.35]It's back?
[77:08.59]I was going to say...
[77:09.63]That game was all over the... That was a cool game.
[77:11.61]That was the game with the flashlight, right?
[77:13.11]Ooh.
[77:25.00]Our take on the genre.
[77:26.78]The first game had horror elements to it, but it was an action game.
[77:31.01]I'm actually more interested in this than I was before.
[77:32.63]We feel that this is the perfect genre to bring together the story and gameplay closer than ever before.
[77:39.17]Because the story, horror story, is at the very heart of this.
[77:42.96]And it's psychological, layered, deep mystery to dive into.
[77:46.16]I cannot wait.
[77:47.26]I you know you actually that's incredible I can't wait to see what you're doing with this game I know you said to me a while ago this was your dream project and I'm so honored that we got to announce this here at the game awards so we're going to hear more next year I think right yes we you know fitting to the theme yes we're going to go dark okay for a while to work on this we'll be back next year some time okay to show more
[78:11.97]Alright.
[78:12.47]Summer 2022.
[78:14.03]More on Alan Wake.
[78:14.83]You played control.
[78:15.69]I didn't.
[78:16.05]I heard it was good.
[78:17.13]Very exciting.
[78:18.15]Alright.
[78:18.83]Well, now I'd like to welcome a comedian, writer, and a well-known chili dog enthusiast.
[78:24.04]It's Ben Schwartz.
[78:25.50]It's the Jim Carrey!
[78:29.52]He'll be back soon.
[78:30.28]He'll be there soon.
[78:30.72]I'm coming.
[78:38.34]How is everybody today?
[78:39.15]How is everybody today?
[78:40.68]He scrunches down into a ball and puts his legs up here with his butt right here and he starts echoing.
[78:47.40]and then tries to roll?
[78:48.24]Fringe?
[78:48.54]Or like Chad?
[78:49.00]What do you guys think?
[78:50.16]I agree.
[79:11.95]You need to go outside?
[79:12.93]I go outside all the time.
[79:13.85]My vitamin D levels up.
[79:14.37]My blood vitamin D is 38.
[79:15.19]Oh, yeah.
[79:31.30]I can't.
[79:31.58]I actually... I liked that movie.
[79:34.59]I don't... people would've... This isn't like the real trailer.
[79:36.67]This is a blank DVD for effect.
[79:38.73]If this was the real trailer, I feel like we'd be screwed because there's no computer with a DVD drive anymore, so this would be, like, troublesome.
[79:45.48]I've got a 40 blood vitamin D level.
[79:47.86]We all are about Sonic 2.
[79:49.22]So many incredible people are in this movie.
[79:51.78]We got James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Colleen O'Shaughnessy as Tails, Idris Elba as Knuckles,
[80:01.65]I want to see this, please.
[80:02.45]And of course, the legend Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik.
[80:09.37]Now, Jim has actually sent a very special video over to say hello to all of you.
[80:14.63]Please be in the costume.
[80:15.73]Because I have the video with me right here.
[80:17.86]Oh, a callback.
[80:19.82]I'm happy.
[80:20.32]Just kidding.
[80:20.78]This is blank still.
[80:21.84]Let's roll the video, Jim.
[80:23.02]What do you say?
[80:26.92]Hello, everyone, and hello, Ben.
[80:29.22]I'm sorry I couldn't be there with you, but I look forward to meeting all of your avatars in the metaverse, where we can really get to know each other.
[80:36.80]Hey, before you see this exciting new Sonic trailer... He's smoking hot.
[80:39.81]I'd like to pass on a word of advice that my Scottish grandfather gave to me when I was just a boy.
[80:44.69]He said, son, don't grade in the grinder.
[80:49.89]Don't do it, son.
[80:51.85]Don't grade in the grinder, boy.
[80:55.36]Create it?
[80:56.40]Shrek 5 confirmed.
[80:56.96]By all means, create it till the cows come home.
[80:59.70]But don't create it in the grinder.
[81:02.14]And then to drive the coin home, he put his hands around my neck and he squeezed real hard and he said, Don't do it, son!
[81:10.19]Don't create it in the grinder!
[81:13.41]Are you listening to me, boy?
[81:15.95]Are you listening?
[81:19.95]Wow.
[81:20.95]Yeah.
[81:23.00]Inspiring words.
[81:24.96]Thank you, Jim.
[81:25.56]You know, I think we all need to hear that.
[81:28.26]Yeah, take it in if you need to.
[81:29.52]That was so weird.
[81:31.04]Great.
[81:31.78]Okay, here we go.
[81:33.60]Thank you again for continuing to support The Blue Blur.
[81:36.06]I love it.
[81:36.48]And it is my honor to present to you the trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
[81:42.43]Enjoy.
[81:42.73]I think it was the people in the audience going like... You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[81:50.47]Quiet.
[81:53.96]Little snack, and here we go.
[81:57.91]Sonic, I love that you want to help make a difference.
[82:00.37]Mind if I drive?
[82:01.33]You're being reckless.
[82:05.81]Don't worry, nobody's gonna get hurt.
[82:09.01]Pretending to be Batman.
[82:10.13]Blue Justice, trademark pending.
[82:12.37]You're still just a kid.
[82:15.89]Trust me, there will come a moment when your powers will be needed.
[82:20.42]But you don't choose that moment.
[82:21.88]That moment chooses you.
[82:23.02]I just got goosebumps.
[82:25.20]Wait a second, did you steal that from Oprah?
[82:27.32]He's back!
[82:35.91]Papa's got a brand new stash.
[82:40.21]Since I've been gone, I've discovered the source of ultimate power.
[82:46.24]That sounds big.
[82:47.68]It's been on my vision board for years.
[82:53.85]I hope I'm not too late.
[82:55.57]Tails!
[82:55.93]I'm sorry, who are you?
[82:57.18]Name's Tails.
[82:58.58]Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
[83:00.48]Step one, light taunting.
[83:02.34]Step two, I have no idea.
[83:04.06]Hang on!
[83:10.22]Whoa!
[83:11.16]That wasn't too bad.
[83:12.42]Today's forecast calls for a 100% chance of adventure.
[83:24.28]Chaos Emeralds?
[83:26.46]Honey!
[83:26.68]Return to sender.
[83:29.52]Face it, you're never going to get my power.
[83:38.51]Do I look like I need your power?
[83:46.03]Where are my manners?
[83:48.59]Sonic meet Knuckles.
[84:02.72]So, so fun.
[84:03.92]Drilling commentary.
[84:05.08]I can't talk over a trailer.
[84:06.30]Most anticipated game is Horizon Forbidden West from Guerrilla Games.
[84:09.76]What?
[84:09.96]The team is hard at work back home in Amsterdam, finishing it up for a February release, but I'm grateful they put together this for the fans.
[84:20.21]I gotta set up for this one.
[84:20.99]What was the game?
[84:22.65]What was the game?
[84:23.07]What was it?
[84:23.41]What was the game?
[84:23.91]Remember, you talk through all the other trailers.
[84:29.01]I don't talk through Jim Carrey no matter what.
[84:32.25]That's like talking to church.
[84:33.86]Are you shitting me?
[84:36.79]And the machines are out of control.
[85:04.28]Constant conflict.
[85:05.42]Yeah, it is.
[85:10.93]Oh, that's chugging.
[85:13.41]That's chugging.
[85:14.37]That's chugging.
[85:21.30]Wow, that actually looks cool.
[85:31.91]That last 10 seconds made me want this game.
[85:34.59]That looked really cool.
[85:48.66]The gameplay was lagging.
[85:51.58]It's early!
[85:53.09]It's early!
[85:54.09]Relax.
[85:58.05]I thought that was her making those sounds.
[86:02.45]I thought she was going like I was like holy shit who is this?
[86:26.18]There's one thing I wish I could do.
[86:27.52]It was play a musical instrument, but I got these fingers.
[86:32.62]They don't work.
[86:34.12]I can't.
[86:35.92]I got this, which never closes and never ceases.
[86:40.53]This works just fine.
[86:41.83]These, not so much.
[87:04.34]It's actually not much of an issue, you just need practice.
[87:07.92]I hold a pencil like this.
[87:12.57]I don't think practice is going to help me.
[87:15.83]Wow, Game Awards Orchestra, thank you so much.
[87:18.43]I am so ready for this game.
[87:20.05]Thank you so much to Lauren and the orchestra, and in her first ever performance and trip to the United States, the beautiful Julie Elvin.
[87:27.34]Thank you so much, Julie.
[87:31.20]Class.
[87:31.52]Mario RPG, OST, Chrono Trigger, OST.
[87:48.01]on gaming consoles in 2021.
[87:50.92]Also on the music front, some of the music we've been playing tonight is from Sessions Diana.
[87:55.06]Sessions is Riot Games project with music made to be safe to stream without fears of copyright issues.
[88:00.37]Check out sessions.riotgames.com to download the full album.
[88:04.25]And now it's time for a special and long awaited announcement.
[88:10.30]Like percussion?
[88:11.58]I can do that.
[88:12.00]Just swinging and hitting things.
[88:14.04]Cloud, let us defy destiny together.
[88:20.22]I'm going to drop plate number seven.
[88:21.76]They're going to do what?
[88:23.37]What the?
[88:26.89]Final Fantasy.
[88:27.71]Is this when they're going to finally reveal the other characters?
[88:29.47]This will be a memory to cherish for the rest of your lives.
[88:40.54]If Katz sits not in this trailer, I'm gonna have a problem.
[88:45.09]This is the PC port.
[88:46.45]Oh.
[89:11.43]Alright.
[89:11.73]So when is the second part coming out, right?
[89:14.57]Xbox Game Pass for PC.
[89:29.83]2021 Game Awards, Xbox Game Pass for PC and YouTube.
[89:34.47]What do we think?
[89:35.23]You know, it's so effortful.
[89:37.33]I like that we animated.
[89:38.77]You're welcome.
[89:39.53]Okay, I understand the impulse to do something big, but what do PC gamers actually want?
[89:46.49]I don't think it's that.
[89:47.59]Video graphics cards.
[89:49.86]We have some great ones coming day one.
[89:51.74]That aren't 400% marked up.
[89:53.76]Marketing idea.
[89:54.64]What if Gator tweets out this list, more or less leaking it in a cool, hip way?
[89:58.96]I retweet it because I have so many more followers than him.
[90:00.92]It's done.
[90:01.70]What's done?
[90:02.28]Tweeted.
[90:02.68]It's out there.
[90:03.28]No, you didn't.
[90:03.91]I don't think you should have done that.
[90:04.95]Proactivity ain't a crime, man.
[90:06.25]We'll figure it out.
[90:07.13]When people think about Xbox Game Pass, they think about console.
[90:10.21]They don't know we're a PC gaming service.
[90:12.21]Why not just call it PC Game Pass?
[90:15.59]That's a great idea.
[90:17.27]OK, we're going with that.
[90:18.85]Just like that, you're going to change the name of the whole thing because of Gaeta, who calls himself Gaeta.
[90:24.22]It's a good name.
[90:25.10]All we got to do is add some top tier streamers to this to really land it.
[90:29.34]Gaeta, yes.
[90:30.20]What about 100 Thieves?
[90:32.56]Big fans.
[90:33.94]That's 100 Thieves.
[90:35.09]Where are the other 97?
[90:36.73]I get it.
[90:37.11]That's funny.
[90:37.47]Thank you, man.
[90:37.83]We'll take it from here, brother.
[90:39.11]We got cameos.
[90:40.07]We got ideas percolating, right?
[90:41.99]Next steps to me are just talking about like... What about Jerva?
[90:45.43]I said it.
[90:46.27]Are we really going to make it for the Game Awards and you're not going to wrap in it at all?
[90:51.33]Get that meeting.
[90:52.69]Fucking... Get away with that.
[90:54.43]Graphics cards need to be cheaper.
[90:57.92]And I get thrown out.
[90:58.66]I guess that's kind of like saying we're at the Game Awards.
[91:30.51]Why is the stream in 480?
[91:32.11]It's not, I swear to God, it's 1080.
[91:45.44]Candy Crush?
[91:50.09]For a second, I thought that was a new Mario.
[91:51.25]I was like, they're going to just really just announce a new Mario like that?
[91:54.29]That's the golf one that I promised.
[92:01.09]It's 864p.
[92:02.18]Yeah, but the stream I'm pulling is 1080.
[92:06.60]Slime Rancher 2 is on day one release for the PC Game Pass.
[92:09.32]Are you lying to me right now, or do you mean that?
[92:14.40]Hello, Game Awards.
[92:15.22]My name is Martin Foss-Anderson, aka Mr. Savage.
[92:17.80]It's really bad if you're stressed before you're trying to play a game and trying to win it.
[92:22.56]If I was stressed after school, I just wouldn't be able to focus properly, and it would just make everything ten times harder.
[92:29.15]Together with truth, I have an important message.
[92:31.31]Vaping nicotine can increase anxiety symptoms and stress levels.
[92:34.59]I think it's really important people know the truth about vaping nicotine.
[92:37.49]Yeah, don't vape.
[92:42.06]What are you doing?
[92:50.27]Smoke is bad.
[92:51.55]What are you doing?

[94:10.80]Sorry, sorry.
[94:11.42]Where was I?
[94:12.50]The prompter, right?
[94:14.18]What's he supposed to be watching?
[94:15.32]Action is the best when it's kinetic and fast-paced and totally organic to the... No, you did not, Master Chief!
[94:24.67]No, you didn't!
[94:25.27]Is he watching a stream?
[94:26.67]Sorry, guys.
[94:27.23]Look, you guys know that Halo just came out, right?
[94:30.29]Is that person with a phone filming?
[94:34.24]And it's literally sitting in my living room while I gotta be here.
[94:40.19]He's watching your stream.
[94:41.55]Name drop me.
[94:42.39]Name drop me.
[94:43.05]Let's see it.
[94:43.53]Stop yelling.
[94:43.93]Why am I yelling?
[94:44.45]Didn't play it.
[95:04.90]Didn't play it.
[95:07.76]Come on.
[95:10.00]Didn't play it.
[95:11.12]Come on.
[95:15.90]I played this one.
[95:20.89]That's two.
[95:25.13]Oh, absolutely, that should not be on the list.
[95:27.05]That should absolutely be taken off.
[95:30.37]That shouldn't be on here.
[95:31.07]I didn't play this either.
[95:56.54]Stop doing the pog joke.
[95:58.72]You know what?
[95:59.68]I actually agree with you.
[96:00.64]Because every time I do that, I hear a snap down here.
[96:05.79]I have to stop doing that.
[96:06.61]You're right.
[96:06.97]I won't do that anymore.
[96:10.79]Wow.
[96:11.83]Thank you.
[96:13.61]We are so happy to be here to accept the award for everyone who worked on Returnal.
[96:19.00]When I first joined Housemarque, I could tell Returnal was a really special game, and it was our amazing team that pulled it off and brought you the game that you play today.
[96:27.66]What is this?
[96:28.18]Thank you to the amazing team at Housemarque in Helsinki, Finland, our incredible co-dev partners who helped us build Returnal, our amazing partners at xDev, represented by Pedro, and everyone at PlayStation.
[96:40.25]We're so grateful we could build a game like Returnal.
[96:43.49]Space game?
[96:44.79]It's PS5.
[96:48.37]Is it good?
[96:52.97]I mean, literally just one best action game.
[96:55.79]Should be good.
[97:01.77]It's very good.
[97:02.63]It's a rogue-like action shooter.
[97:05.35]Oh, shit.
[97:06.21]Should I try it?
[97:06.65]It actually kind of looks cool.
[97:12.22]Should I play it?
[97:17.66]Really good.
[97:18.68]Alright.
[97:21.88]Maybe I'll give it a look.
[97:22.50]Only on PS5?
[97:22.72]Oh, okay.
[97:22.90]I gotta get a PS5 then.
[97:23.50]And you boarded Sabaton's ship.
[97:45.99]Good luck.
[97:46.45]I know.
[97:47.35]Look, can I just, like, come over your house and just, like, smell the exhaust of your PS5?
[97:58.30]Like, can I just, like, you know what I mean?
[98:00.52]Like, I want to, like, at least be able to know.
[98:05.92]What happened next?
[98:07.42]My ghost brought me back.
[98:09.28]We kept going.
[98:12.37]She knew we would.
[98:12.99]Somebody just said it.
[98:17.76]It was somebody.
[98:19.82]No nothing just said no.
[98:32.08]I just put my hand at the back of the exhaust and feel the heat.
[98:34.96]Feel the air.
[98:35.60]Just go, oh dude, it's like it's hot.
[98:39.41]Yeah, just like us.
[98:54.92]No, dude.
[98:55.12]You can't touch anything in my house.
[98:57.67]Yeah, what is going on here?
[99:35.34]He's going insane because it's boring.
[99:37.06]No, this one's been some pretty cool reveals.
[99:38.64]Oh, it's Destiny.
[99:39.10]Playing that one in PvP.
[99:39.96]Playing that one in PvP.
[99:54.39]Alright, now it is time to get to another new game announcement.
[99:58.23]A few months ago, a Japanese game creator reached out to me and said, hey, I want to announce my next game at the Game Awards, and I'm so honored to have this opportunity to present this global announcement to all of you.
[100:09.43]Please enjoy.
[100:09.97]They're just rolling them out.
[100:12.90]Just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, huh?
[100:22.50]What?
[100:45.02]Oh shit.
[100:46.10]Something good here.
[100:58.93]Holy shit.
[101:12.58]Oh!
[101:27.76]This one has my attention.
[101:33.38]Slither head?
[101:55.66]that's a fun one it's clear toy Amazon has not abandoned his roots uh thank you again for that very special announcement speaking of uh just that we have another brand new game to announce from a studio comprised of many industry veterans check this out that looked really action-y though that did not look like a typical runaway and hide kind of game that looked like you were fighting stuff with swords
[102:24.41]Zip, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.
[102:29.80]Wishlist them?
[102:30.76]I don't think they're available.
[102:34.68]Oh, they put the human face on the top.
[102:44.93]Ever since the day the portal network collapsed, stranding us in these realms, we have searched for a way home.
[102:55.50]What about the balls?
[102:59.04]You are never going to get a huge monster like that with just a huge swinging nutsack.
[103:03.14]It's never going to happen.
[103:04.86]Just stop.
[103:06.30]People are like, oh, where's the ball?
[103:08.43]It's not going to happen.
[103:11.47]And the crazy part is... It would be... It's not going to happen.
[103:18.07]Stop saying it.
[103:18.63]Half-Life 1 had it?
[103:25.38]Like these 500-foot dinosaurs.
[103:29.00]I'm s- Somebody said it would be a crit spot.
[103:46.17]What the fuck, dude?
[103:49.47]How inappropriate and stupid.
[103:54.50]That would be like, no.
[103:57.14]Why?
[103:57.38]I would not want to play that game.
[104:30.18]Oh.
[104:33.25]Admit it, you'd love to play that.
[104:36.17]It would be really strange.
[104:37.61]It would be like, wow, they do it.
[104:39.29]This giant dinosaur monster has huge balls.
[104:40.59]How would you even react to that?
[104:54.71]SHARED WORLD IDEAS SO WE WANT TO BRING PLAYERS TOGETHER, SOLO EXPERIENCES, COOPERATIVE EXPERIENCES, LOTS OF ABILITY TO GO AND EXPLORE THESE AMAZING, FANTASTICAL, MAGICAL REALMS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PLAYERS.

[105:23.61]I feel like they haven't done any winners.
[105:24.81]Like three.
[105:25.03]A Z targetable point?
[105:52.41]Like... You can just go down.
[105:56.49]Right now, meet one of the new members of our future class.
[106:03.03]Oh, hi.
[106:03.93]I'm DJ Knight, and I stream World of Warcraft.
[106:08.76]Oh, they gotta hate me right now, and I love it.
[106:10.46]My focus is primarily joy.
[106:13.04]A VATS target?
[106:15.60]Everybody has the potential to be cynical about everything.
[106:18.74]This game sucks.
[106:22.91]What's happening?
[106:23.43]What's going on?
[106:26.53]What's happening?
[106:29.21]I thought I was doing that.
[106:33.10]Because I have the GoXLR.
[106:34.60]Hello, world.
[106:35.24]I'm Jaroslav Bek from Beat Games.
[106:36.48]And I'm thrilled to announce our new music pack collaboration.
[106:39.76]Lady Gaga music pack launches on Beat Saber tonight.
[106:42.84]See you all in multiplayer.
[106:49.56]Wait, you guys heard that, right?
[106:51.46]Yeah, you definitely heard that.
[106:57.96]I'm sorry, but that first swing hits the desk or the top of a chair or a vase.
[107:04.45]I don't like this, what I would call propaganda from the VR industry with like, oh, just put the headset on and fucking just go.
[107:12.78]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[107:14.02]You have to clear out your entire room.
[107:16.22]You gotta like take your trash out.
[107:18.72]You've got to make sure that there's nothing there.
[107:20.41]It's an empty room.
[107:21.39]Or you're going to get hurt.
[107:24.31]There's no way you put on goggles and just go for it.
[107:26.69]Like, oh, just push the chair over four or five inches.
[107:28.73]No, excuse me.
[107:40.77]What is this?
[107:50.69]Like, if that shit happens, if you did what that person did, you're literally going to karate chop through your desk, like WWF style.
[107:56.57]You're going to go through the table.
[108:05.22]Disney Gollum?
[108:07.36]Yeah, what?
[108:09.96]This is a different style.
[108:11.00]This looks... What is this?
[108:18.37]Lord of the Rings Gollum.
[108:20.57]Is it VR?
[108:21.05]Is it VR?
[108:21.25]Dude.
[108:21.43]Fuck.
[108:22.11]Are you serious?
[108:22.47]Wouldn't you want to like go like this and shit and like crawl around?
[108:24.45]That would have been so cool.
[108:25.87]Jerma's down bad VR.
[108:51.17]Half-Life Alyx was worth buying that for.
[108:52.75]I'm sorry, like, look.
[108:53.37]Half-Life Alyx is worth $1,000, okay?
[108:54.04]We all made that joke 10 years ago.
[108:55.14]I would pay $1,000 for Half-Life 3.
[108:56.18]I did.
[108:56.36]Well, I did.
[108:56.74]And so did a lot of you.
[108:57.52]So, it came true.
[108:58.14]Because that's what we got.
[109:25.03]PUBG 2?
[109:31.01]Is it actually PUBG 2?
[109:31.79]They made a cooking simulator game in VR.
[109:41.30]Sign me up.
[109:41.90]3, 2, loot.
[109:42.10]3, 2, play.
[109:55.07]free to play.
[110:00.60]Wasn't Pub... Wait, PUBG wasn't free already?
[110:04.88]Wait, what?
[110:06.20]Was PUBG not free?
[110:07.38]Was it?
[110:23.18]Oh, shit.
[110:23.56]So it's free.
[110:24.08]Kind of late for that, don't you think?
[110:25.38]I feel like that should have been three or four years ago.
[110:27.35]Aren't most of the Battlegrounds games kind of falling off?
[110:55.99]Fortnite's obviously huge and it will be probably forever.
[110:59.83]They're really big in China.
[111:01.77]Fell off plus L ratio.
[111:08.70]Alright, you just unlocked a memory.
[111:12.56]I have a tweet from like 2016 that somebody ratioed recently.
[111:17.48]And I was like, what are you talking about?
[111:19.44]They went to like an old tweet and they like ratioed me.
[111:22.96]I was- I was trying to figure out what the fuck was happening.
[111:25.88]I got, like, a notification, and I was like, I- because I check my Twitter, like, once a week or something, right?
[111:29.30]And I'm just scrolling down, and I see a tweet that has- I had, like, four likes on this tweet from, like, five years ago.
[111:36.97]And the person wrote, like, oh, I ratioed you about the fucker or something, and I was like, what?
[111:41.25]And they had, like, more likes than I did.
[111:49.24]But it's just like, that tweet's, like, seven years old.
[111:54.50]It made me laugh.
[111:55.66]I was like, holy shit.
[112:01.10]I got fucking destroyed.
[112:04.08]I actually audibly was like, that's fucking funny.
[112:07.14]Yeah, and I need to ask this question.
[112:11.80]Listen to me.
[112:12.44]Very important.
[112:13.10]I know I can't pause the game where it's live.
[112:16.82]People are like going back to tweets.
[112:19.94]from like 2014 and shit and like liking them or like replying to them like they were yesterday.
[112:26.97]Like, oh, Ursula, Woman Crush Wednesday.
[112:30.47]I wrote that when I was like nine, okay?
[112:35.33]I keep getting notifications from tweets from like 10 years ago.
[112:38.38]People just like, oh yeah, I retweet that.

[114:58.66]Cool.
[115:00.18]This is cute.
[115:01.48]Then with a leisurely climb into the mountains.
[115:05.24]Just remember to watch your step.
[115:10.99]Or perhaps the icy tundra is more to your liking.
[115:15.24]Don't forget to pack your mittens.
[115:18.74]Look out for the walloping winter whale.
[115:23.24]Next stop, the dramatic Western Plains under the watchful eye of Sheriff Winchester.
[115:28.94]Yee-haw!
[115:33.06]I can't wait to play this.
[115:35.12]Only thing I actually cared about.
[116:04.25]It's quite a wait.
[116:05.71]What?
[116:08.97]It's really awesome to see they actually got to finish it.
[116:13.11]That's awesome.
[116:13.75]I can't wait.
[116:14.74]We have a date.
[116:15.68]June 30th, 2022.
[116:17.62]It's so exciting.
[116:18.42]The delicious last course.
[116:20.04]Alright.
[116:20.56]Next up, earlier you saw the trailer for Sonic 2, the movie.
[116:23.80]And now it's time for the little blue guy to give you a glimpse at his next game, also coming in 2022.
[116:28.81]Next game.
[116:39.57]How about Alan Wake?
[116:40.39]Oh, yeah.
[116:57.20]Is it going to be a Sonic... Well, it's 3D, three-dimensional.
[117:00.16]That's important to know.
[117:10.65]I'm going to hold judgment because they make him do weird shit.
[117:13.21]I wouldn't be surprised if he got a lab coat and was making potions and shit in like an underground mad scientist laboratory.
[117:18.71]Sonic in the mad science laboratory.
[117:20.31]Just make it a Sonic game.
[117:21.21]Come on.
[117:21.83]Please.
[117:40.00]Not a Frontiers?
[117:55.39]Stop making up scenarios to get outraged at.
[117:59.90]That's the point of a straw man!
[118:04.84]I build his ass up so I can knock his ass down!
[118:22.80]It's just temporary.
[118:25.15]The folks here, they don't make no never mind who you are or what you've done.
[118:32.11]Everything's got to be new these days.
[118:34.67]Sensational.
[118:37.02]Let the mirror show you who you are.
[118:42.10]What's your pitch, pal?
[118:43.46]You on the level?
[118:44.90]I'd love to learn anything that you want to teach me.
[118:47.90]I can read them more quick.
[118:49.44]Is this an FMV game?
[118:50.44]Holy shit.
[118:51.70]Please.
[118:52.08]Folks will pay good money just to make themselves feel better.
[118:59.99]When a man believes his own lies and people get hurt, then you lie.
[119:09.83]You try to find your way out.
[119:11.51]I warned you, didn't I?
[119:15.06]There is no way out.
[119:19.62]Oh, it's not?
[119:20.14]Okay, never mind.
[119:22.46]We already knew about this.
[119:23.36]That was the best trailer I've seen since Death Stranding.
[119:26.82]Now onto awards business.
[119:28.70]I am honored to be announcing the Best Art Direction category.
[119:32.68]These nominees across a broad variety of budgets and genres each found their own path to combining visual design, music, and animation into their own distinct expression of intent and purpose.
[119:46.93]That looks good though.
[119:47.97]That looks actually really good.
[119:49.21]I'm just looking for one more.
[119:49.95]This has been nominated like four or five times.
[119:51.80]Is this good?
[120:27.49]I didn't play any of those.
[120:29.49]And the game award for best art direction goes to... Psychonauts 2, if I were to guess.
[120:35.31]Deathloop.
[120:38.29]Wait, this is the game that you rewind time and go fight yourself and your other... You have to kill each other going, rewinding and shit.
[120:45.60]I should play this.
[120:58.32]This is super weird because last night I made the bet that Guillermo del Toro would be giving this award, so... I can't give an opinion.
[121:07.46]I will stick to my speech.
[121:08.82]Everybody's looking for like a hot take here.
[121:11.10]I didn't play this.
[121:12.84]I've never even seen the trailer.
[121:15.82]I now have a flashback of when I was studying the 60s era by watching his movie, The Shape of Water.

[122:21.81]Damn, really?
[122:24.63]What did I say?
[122:25.13]I was like, I can't give you any... I'm basically like a guy that just got picked up from the subway.

[123:13.44]I got one.
[123:36.69]I don't even know who got nominated.
[123:38.11]Well, let's see who was right.
[123:39.29]Here are the nominees for Content Creator of the Year.
[123:43.59]And the Game Award goes to... Dream!
[123:46.80]Congratulations, Dream.
[123:48.84]Of course not here in person.
[123:50.92]Here are the nominees for Best Multiplayer Game.
[123:54.89]And the Game Award goes to... It Takes Two!
[124:00.05]Yeah!
[124:01.75]That one's actually good.
[124:03.08]That one's actually really good.
[124:05.12]Holy shit, that game's amazing, actually.
[124:07.96]That's three.
[124:08.24]Guys, I'm... I am never gonna... I am never gonna get nominated.
[124:10.52]I'm never gonna win a single award.
[124:27.24]I talk about how I might show my dick on stream.
[124:29.80]No one's going to nominate me for anything.
[124:32.14]It's never going to happen.
[124:32.94]Why are you waiting for it?
[124:35.57]It's not going to happen.
[124:38.51]Don't be waiting for that.
[124:40.69]Look at me.
[124:41.71]Look at me.
[124:42.33]I'm not going to get nominated for anything.
[124:54.23]culture and within the world where you see something that throws you dick of the year I know that things right now are very very difficult I know that things are all over the place in lots of different ways it's scary man I mean it's that's just there's no other way to put it it is scary to be black in this country today
[125:21.75]I'm a black mom, so I'm scared.
[125:23.96]A lot of people in gaming communities just don't want to hear it.
[125:27.12]We sat down for about two hours or so, just kind of ran through our feelings and emotions.
[125:31.74]Because it's all, I don't want to bring politics.
[125:34.32]Well, I'm glad that you can ignore this shit because it's quote unquote politics when there's a lot of people's reality.
[125:39.11]So the show goes up, it launches.
[125:42.21]I'm happy to be your streamer of the year.
[125:44.15]Hey, you need to check this out.
[125:45.25]Hey, you need to be paying attention to this.
[125:47.44]And then one of the big outlets caught it.
[125:50.19]Then it just moves.
[125:51.73]Let's just speak the 100% truth.
[125:52.95]You know, I'd always wanted to use my voice in a way that felt powerful, really bring home the conversation about doing a show through a prism of blackness.
[126:01.66]I think we did the job in a really good way.
[126:03.74]And I think the world and the industry was better for it.
[126:15.55]When you said ego, what do you say?
[126:16.77]Oh, I want to read this.
[126:18.49]Ego, Andy, what did it say?
[126:21.07]That ego Andy is trying to cope with him not winning an award.
[126:34.80]I don't, I really don't care.
[126:36.06]I don't.
[126:40.52]I really just, I, trust me.
[126:46.89]It's PUBG again.
[126:50.44]Doesn't care.
[126:51.02]I don't.
[126:58.34]I think I need some kind of reward.
[127:06.33]I think I need some kind of reward to prove that I... I really, like, just wanted one...
[127:24.81]With Amazon Luna, I can play all my favorite games straight from the cloud.
[127:28.69]That's right.
[127:29.51]I can play on my Fire TV, tablet, and phone.
[127:32.69]I thought I did a good job this year.
[127:35.19]The lineup looks awesome.
[127:36.53]Yakuza Like a Dragon, Devil May Cry 5, Judgment, Ripple Sticks Extraction.
[127:42.22]I thought I did a good job this year.
[127:44.72]Luna Couch, anyone?
[127:47.30]I'm in.
[127:48.10]Feels like I'm on your couch.
[127:49.50]Let's go.
[127:58.69]You got a bunch of people spamming loser loser cry loser If you just came into the stream you'd be like holy shit what the fuck these people are assholes these people are total pricks They cry you fucking loser
[128:28.81]And now I'm wet.
[128:41.56]I kind of want to go get a shitload of water and dump it in my eyes and go fullscreen and be crying that I didn't win content creator of the year.
[128:48.95]Will you guys play along with that for a little while?
[129:08.62]Just have like boogers like flowing out of my nose Why would anybody stream them doing that?
[129:19.44]Victory favors the faithful
[129:37.14]Now there is shitload of other content creators guys that are doing all kinds of cool shit, so don't worry.
[129:51.70]Although I would have liked to have seen Ludwig on that list.
[129:55.92]She's an actor who stars in The Mandalorian and the upcoming series The Book of Boba Fett.
[130:02.14]Please welcome Ming-Na Wen.
[130:15.19]Also, some of the VTubers have just exploded in growth and popularity.
[130:19.75]There's so many good creators.
[130:23.01]There just are.
[130:25.37]To be nominated for the Best Narrative Award, a great game demands provocative dialog and a captivating plot.
[130:33.05]But above all, it must exhibit a meaningful involvement with the audience.
[130:39.50]And also, just speaking as the mother of a son who loves gaming...
[130:44.59]It's nice when there's more to the story than just blowing up grenade factories and shouting obscenities at your alligator brides.
[130:53.05]What if you won worst creator?
[130:54.28]That would be actually really funny.
[130:55.18]Here are the nominees for best narrative.
[130:57.72]Then like the crying on camera like, I did a good job this year.
[131:01.54]Oh, that would be funny.
[131:04.00]Piecing together the puzzle.
[131:06.59]You know, I would really like them to do more than one content creator category.
[131:09.57]Streaming, YouTube, it's so huge now.
[131:11.73]It's taken over.
[131:12.17]It's so in the mainstream at this point that I feel like there should be more than a few categories.
[131:34.45]It's hard to recognize everybody when you have one category.
[131:47.03]Keep coping.
[131:47.69]That's what I'm doing.
[131:59.87]Best narrative?
[132:00.67]Wait.
[132:02.27]Is this an original narrative?
[132:08.88]Okay, that was a surprise.
[132:13.38]There are so many people responsible for making this such a wonderful thing.
[132:18.38]I want to thank Marvel Game Studios for trusting us with their characters and for allowing us to make them our own, for our fabulous cast, for bringing them to life in ways that words on a page can never do.
[132:32.05]for olivier is it takes two on there hubert jf my game director the entire crew who worked on it and of course my wonderfully wild wacky immensely talented writers thank you for making comedy the game is really good yeah I heard that too not complaining too often when I pushed you to remember our main themes of grief and to go deeper
[132:58.44]Who am I kidding?
[132:59.14]I know you complained, but thank you for not doing it to me.
[133:03.36]Thank you, everyone.
[133:04.32]This is an honor.
[133:09.48]I think the problem that anybody that works on a huge popular franchise licensed thing is even if it is really good, you have to fight against the sort of stigma of being the licensed video game.
[133:23.61]You're already up against a pretty high wall.
[133:35.04]But yeah, I heard it.
[133:35.64]I actually heard it was pretty good.
[133:46.53]I'm not going to play it, but I heard it was good.
[133:49.31]I don't play video games.
[134:05.71]This kind of reminds me of Wind Waker.
[134:13.30]Can't you float around in Wind Waker?
[134:21.26]There could be a bird too.
[134:30.97]I'm interested.
[134:48.41]That looks cute.
[135:02.31]What a beautiful game.
[135:03.53]Alright, now we have something very special, the gameplay world premiere trailer for Rocksteady's newest title, Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League.
[135:12.53]We've all been waiting anxiously for them to give us a first look at... Ha ha ha!
[135:17.48]It crashed!
[135:18.80]Look at your crash!
[135:19.94]It crashed!
[135:21.32]Kaylee!
[135:22.92]What the hell do you think you're doing?
[135:25.08]Huh?
[135:26.96]That footage is strictly classified.
[135:38.65]is director Amanda waller am I cringe and since the game awards doesn't care about disclosing classified intel listen up I was being somebody in the audience about task force x that wasn't me there's somebody in the audience of the justice league or superman rampaging through the streets of metropolis you better not say a word ever to anyone
[136:06.43]Because if you do, believe you me, I'll hear about it.
[136:13.14]You've all been warned.
[136:15.50]Waller out.
[136:25.27]We don't know who that was.
[136:26.11]Does anyone know who that is?
[136:27.97]Scott, good.
[136:28.77]Alright.
[136:29.07]Well, I think we've waited long enough to see Rocksteady's new game.
[136:32.81]This is going to be worth the risk.
[136:34.33]You guys want to do it?
[136:37.02]Let's all watch this together.
[136:41.08]When I think of the Justice League, I think of Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern.
[136:48.87]You don't want to mess with that one.
[136:50.91]But you, Barry, you're just the team mascot, aren't you, mate?
[136:56.85]The loser of the league, folks.
[136:59.43]The fastest man alive.
[137:02.02]It's...
[137:06.59]I just hope the Joker's in this.
[137:44.99]Is it like multiplayer or you pick a character?
[137:50.77]I don't know.
[137:51.39]Co-op.
[138:14.27]It's a gun type game.
[138:16.61]Who are you going to main?
[138:30.37]Mr. Furious.
[138:31.07]Either that or the spleen.
[138:33.95]I'm not sure.
[138:58.63]It looks like it could be kind of fun.
[139:07.79]Really thought Flasher had us that time.
[139:11.05]Holy shit.
[139:13.33]Is that just from fear?
[139:14.81]Oh shit.
[139:21.24]From the upcoming game Forspoken, here are the performers Ella Blinka and Pollyanna McIntosh.
[139:32.17]I'm so excited to be here I'm probably not going to play it you may have met the character I portray in full spoken frey Holland I am so excited to be here to announce a brand new trailer and especially delighted tonight as we will be seeing pollyanna's first portrayal of tanta prav for the very first time she is a ruthless adversary for frey and I hope players get into it looking for a boss fight with this woman at some point
[139:57.82]I definitely hope that you're in a boss fight.
[140:00.18]Thank you, Ella.
[140:01.06]That's so kind.
[140:02.50]Even if it is with Frey?
[140:03.76]Especially if it's with Frey.
[140:07.16]And now a world premiere trailer for Forspoken.
[140:13.02]Stop pretending to be interested.
[140:14.90]You're not going to play any of these games.
[140:17.48]You'll be too busy playing like Fart Simulator 2013.
[140:20.16]I do not know how I got here.
[140:24.35]And all I want is to go home.
[140:31.26]people are afraid they look to me in the council for hope that we cannot give them but maybe the truth really hurts it does it hurts everything that corruption touches I'll play Elden Ring you know I will it is you who trespassed on my land you will set this battle in motion
[141:02.90]Hey dude, you gonna play Destiny PvP tomorrow?
[141:04.75]Start banning people that say that.
[141:07.17]For like an hour at least.
[141:10.97]How do you plead?
[141:18.16]Not guilty.
[141:19.08]Lies!
[141:20.32]She dies!
[141:33.11]You guys are so fucking funny.
[141:35.09]Seriously.
[141:35.63]I'm going to have so much trouble stopping streaming eventually.
[141:45.08]You guys are just so funny.
[141:47.58]Sometimes.
[141:49.90]Some of the shit you guys say is so... I love it.
[142:09.35]What is this?
[142:18.33]If it's a Warhammer, I have a very personal, personal grudge against Warhammer 40k.
[142:24.32]That's what it is.
[142:31.06]When Dawn of War 2 came out, I was so excited because I thought they were going to eventually put in the Tau, because the Tau was what I played in the original Dawn of War games, right?
[142:41.71]They just don't give a shit about the Tau.
[142:45.57]I love that.
[142:47.13]They're awesome.
[142:48.55]The battle suits, the... I'm a Tau player, yeah.
[142:55.17]And they kept putting in just shit that we've already seen a thousand times, like Dawn of War 3, let's do this one.
[142:59.61]No Tau, Tau.
[143:00.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[143:01.25]Never again.
[143:11.22]Tau is in the game.
[143:12.36]Yeah, they added Tau to the game when the shit had like eight concurrent players on Steam.
[143:21.67]It took too long.
[143:25.98]I love Dawn of War.
[143:26.95]It's like one of my favorite RTS franchises.
[143:30.11]What?
[143:32.70]I'm very curious what this is.
[144:00.39]Space Marine 2.
[144:09.65]Alright, that's cool.
[144:14.62]Put the Tau in that game.
[144:16.02]Put the Tau in this game.
[144:20.14]Joining me now is Tim Willitsch from Saber and the star of the game who will play Captain Titus, Clive Standen.
[144:26.11]Tim, what did we just see?
[144:27.98]Well, I'm just so excited I can finally talk about this game.
[144:30.68]We are making Space Marine 2, a sequel to the iconic Warhammer 40K game.
[144:36.82]And at Saber, we're using the experience that we have learned from games like Halo, Quake Champions, World War Z, to really bring this game to life, to make it the most intense action game ever.
[144:50.81]And we've got Clive as a Space Marine.
[144:53.53]It's awesome.
[144:54.55]Clive, how does it feel to be in the game?
[144:55.93]This will be fun.
[144:56.31]It's a dream, a pretty bleak and grim dream, but anyone who's ever seen any of the work I've done, I'm not scared of the darkness.
[145:04.37]No, I'm stoked and grateful to be a part of this.
[145:06.77]I used to play with and paint the Space Marines when I was a kid with my older brother, so the chance to play one of the most iconic characters in the Warhammer 40k universe is everything to me.
[145:17.98]That's cool.
[145:18.44]Oh, holy smokes.
[145:18.98]Quiet.
[145:47.96]We don't really good at what we do
[146:24.84]You can still kick people in the balls.
[146:26.28]Don't worry, everybody.
[146:27.14]Next step is to find people that can shoot guns.
[146:31.03]Fuck you.
[146:59.36]What the fuck?
[147:02.09]You play a jet?
[147:11.72]Saints Row.
[147:12.94]The return of the McGriddler.
[147:32.58]I mean, that didn't show Nightmare Before Christmas.
[147:36.12]Is this Fall, guys?
[148:05.19]Is this still a thing?
[148:10.91]One of the reasons why I stopped playing Fall Guys is because they were like seven games in the whole game.
[148:15.73]They were like seven maps.
[148:17.75]Have they updated it?
[148:21.45]Look at all these brand deals.
[148:23.92]Look at all these licensing deals.
[148:30.92]What the fuck?
[148:34.81]There's still plenty of show left, and why would you want to watch alone when you could watch with me and Ariel Powers?
[148:38.61]Exactly.
[148:39.25]Tune into our watch party to see a lot of exclusive interviews and industrial-spanked takes.

[150:53.44]Is one title enough?
[150:55.38]For Game of the Year?
[150:57.46]What about one sponsor?
[151:00.00]No way.
[151:02.30]I don't think it's going to win, but... You know.

[152:15.44]Will this win?
[152:17.84]Metroid Dread.
[152:21.44]You better show the crisp banana gift if it wins Game of the Year.
[152:27.56]It's guaranteed to not win Game of the Year, by the way.
[152:32.26]Thank you for waiting.
[152:34.12]And now let the games begin.

[153:14.70]This is the Action Adventure category, and Metroid Dread checks off both the Action and the Adventure box.
[153:22.49]it's filled with action-packed moments behind every door around every corner I have to play a metroid game it introduces us to a massive and mysterious new planet that players can explore and adventure through it's the result of a true collaboration between Nintendo and Mercury steam and I have a few comments that the developers asked me to read on their behalf
[153:47.12]We'd like to say a big thank you for this award from the development teams at Nintendo and Mercury Steam that worked so hard to bring all the Metroid fans around the world the experience that they were hoping for.
[153:58.01]Somebody said it's like a DMT trip looking at the background.
[154:01.41]And this dangerous yet marvelous journey to ZDR.
[154:05.17]We're so thankful for all the fans for enjoying Metroid Dread on Nintendo Switch.
[154:09.86]Thank you very much.
[154:18.28]I don't know what a DMT trip is like.
[154:19.90]I have no idea.
[154:26.42]There it is.
[154:28.22]The biggest death trap in all history.
[154:31.65]And the Duke's headed into its jaws.
[154:34.55]Start with dread?
[154:36.43]Maybe I will.
[154:38.51]Here, we must scrabble for desert power.
[154:41.29]Move slowly, and the day of your revenge will come.
[154:44.48]This is your inheritance.
[154:45.86]Speed is a device of Shaitan.
[154:47.86]Thus, there will always be a desert on Arrakis.
[154:51.95]What is to become of you?
[154:53.39]Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.
[154:55.35]If anything happens to me, your enemy was overwhelming.
[154:58.35]Yet you rule.
[155:01.98]Whoa, dude, look at that hand.
[155:04.50]I'm not bored, I promise.
[155:06.04]Dude, spice wars?
[155:07.06]How does that work?
[155:30.49]You need to eat another edible.
[155:32.03]I did not do anything.
[155:34.51]Please welcome two of the stars of the upcoming Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, Ashley Burch and Will Arnett.
[155:42.14]What is this going to be?
[155:45.92]Oh, that's the Reese's guy.
[155:47.82]That's the Reese's guy.
[155:50.48]There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[155:51.86]Don't listen to them.
[155:53.28]Eat it wherever you want.
[155:54.38]We are so excited to reveal a bit about the story in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.
[155:58.73]And are we talking about the Dragonlord yet?
[156:02.03]Yes, Will plays the Dragonlord, the essential villain within the Wonderlands.
[156:06.61]Yes, but in a clever twist, I turn out to be the underdog hero of the entire realm, and it's really beautiful.
[156:13.23]And it's actually one of the main reasons that I took this role, so.
[156:16.63]So is this like a Borderlands game?
[156:18.33]What do you mean, no?
[156:22.21]You play a necromantic overlord and not the good kind.
[156:26.93]Well, he's a job creator for millions of unemployed individuals.
[156:31.42]He raises the dead, ma'am.
[156:33.12]Yeah, and he gives them stuff to do, okay?
[156:36.54]Some of them get to sail.
[156:38.56]Some form a rock band.
[156:40.12]A lot of them, like, I don't know, stab things or something.
[156:45.08]Do you really not know the story of the game that you're in?
[156:48.14]Sure.
[156:48.54]No.
[156:48.76]You mean the whimsical adventure from the mind of a 13-year-old demolitions expert?
[156:53.60]Yeah.
[156:54.14]Who whimsically tries to blow up the heroes for 40 levels?
[156:58.29]Yeah.
[156:58.63]So if anyone is the central villain here, it's Tiny Tina.
[157:02.37]Alright.
[157:02.69]Roll the damn trailer.
[157:03.59]There they go.
[157:09.95]It's the two-clap Andy.
[157:11.33]And that's usually me.
[157:16.42]I'm usually the two-clap Andy that laughs and does that.
[157:19.28]There's one alone who can wield fate.
[157:22.30]One alone whose story is in their own hands.
[157:26.10]The Fate Maker.
[157:29.28]That's you.
[157:30.52]Heavy, right?
[157:36.73]You seek passage.
[157:38.87]I can aid you.
[157:43.33]This feels like a school assembly.
[157:45.47]The scary stabby one is Fred.
[157:47.99]The undead fall beneath our blades.
[157:52.95]I'm sensing some real evil vibes this way.
[157:56.20]I think it's fine.
[157:58.40]What's wrong with it?
[157:59.52]A beautiful body indeed.
[158:01.80]And full of power.
[158:07.78]I'm invincible.
[158:10.28]Looking bad.
[158:11.36]How do we win this?
[158:13.13]We attack!

[158:37.45]Oh, listen to me lip-flappin' while you can be off adventurin'.
[158:43.44]I wonder how many guns will be in the game.
[158:49.25]Will we please go back to Monster Rancher?
[158:52.39]Yeah, and when this is over.
[158:59.13]Hold on.

[166:52.76]It takes the last frame.
[166:53.78]Why is it not doing that?
[166:54.52]It's not doing it anymore.
[166:55.25]That would have been funny.

[168:41.42]I was going to do that for every single category, but everybody hated it after the second time.
[168:46.30]So I was like, I'm not doing that again.
[168:48.86]That did not land the first two times I did it.
[168:51.23]So I was just like, okay, I didn't even see any minus twos.
[168:54.07]People didn't even react to it.
[168:55.07]They were just like, that was fucking stupid.
[168:56.47]I'm not going to give that a reaction.

[171:08.26]Jeff said it earlier.
[171:09.62]Isn't it great to be back live and in person, back amongst friends?
[171:13.84]It's fantastic.
[171:15.12]This is a wonderful time of the year.
[171:18.99]The Game Awards.
[171:20.60]our opportunity to celebrate the creators and the players.
[171:25.46]What is this, Jeff?
[171:26.76]Eighth year, something like that?
[171:28.22]That's actually pretty cool.
[171:31.52]So much, you know, we've witnessed so much over these past few years, the launch of next generation 8 and 9 consoles, the mobile revolution, streaming games, VR, AR, and quality free-to-play games.
[171:49.22]And this category represents another innovation in our industry.
[171:54.70]This is the award for best ongoing game.
[171:59.07]It used to be that a game would ship and that would be the game.
[172:04.83]But today's developers keep players coming back to their beloved titles again and again by delivering and creating exciting new content.
[172:15.96]Here are the five nominees for engaging their audiences year after year.
[172:20.98]I just want to listen to audiobooks with him talking.
[172:23.24]Best ongoing game.
[172:24.88]Every book, I would have Reggie's voice.
[172:42.39]Hmm.
[172:44.68]I played Genshin Impact for an hour on my iPad.
[172:46.50]And the game award for the best ongoing game goes to... Final Fantasy.
[173:09.08]Yes, I did.
[173:17.90]People really like this game.
[173:20.78]If I still played any games, I would probably play it.
[173:31.19]Not Fortnite, no.
[173:32.77]Not this time.
[173:33.99]The category had so many amazing nominees that it's truly fortunate that we were able to win.
[173:39.59]There's an incredible team behind Final Fantasy XIV who pour their hearts into the work, bringing new and memorable stories and adventures to our fans from A Realm Reborn all the way to Endwalker and beyond.
[173:51.06]So a big thank you to Final Fantasy XIV team and...
[173:55.22]Can't wait to see what's going on in the future.
[173:57.62]And honestly, the biggest thanks to our community.
[174:00.22]They've been our rock and we're so happy that you continue to give us our support.
[174:04.53]Thank you so much.
[174:05.25]That's good.
[174:05.73]Cool.
[174:07.63]Seems like it deserved it.
[174:17.49]We got another permit.
[174:18.25]There's been so many of these.
[174:28.30]Since the dawn of time, we have sought the glory of competition.
[174:33.48]But it wasn't always what you'd call friendly.
[174:37.06]As civilization evolved, so did the desire for battle and the drive to be the best.
[174:43.44]Cities grew, and soon everyone wanted a piece of the action.
[174:49.09]Some for power, some vain.
[174:51.83]But many... Flash?
[174:53.61]I don't think so.
[174:55.95]Even today...
[175:21.43]It's like a melee game.
[175:27.40]Don't mock me.
[175:28.08]I didn't win.
[175:29.10]That's fine, though.
[175:30.04]I don't have to win a Haunted Creator of the Year.
[176:01.17]You know, a lot of people just jump off of buildings.
[176:06.00]In the Super Mario pose.
[176:28.41]Rumbleverse.

[177:34.11]Oh, a hunter.
[177:59.49]I'm serious.
[178:09.58]I really... Can you just put Bloodborne at 60 frames a second and add a couple of costumes and I'll buy it again?
[178:19.65]Are they ever going to do that?
[178:26.45]I wouldn't even care.
[178:27.01]Like, it was like, oh, and we added two DLC costumes.
[178:30.07]Like, who gives a shit?

[182:52.96]This is a foot controller.
[182:54.34]It's like a DDR pad.

[185:23.78]Man, this, uh, that actually might be pretty fun.
[185:41.69]Need a fidget cube?
[185:42.35]Not too small.
[185:42.73]I need a big thing.
[185:43.59]I don't want a fidget cube.
[185:44.78]I want a fidget wall.
[185:45.42]Willy Wonka shit.
[185:45.92]So I can get up and like... You know those one-man band guys?
[185:48.74]Meme?
[186:11.10]Where it's like... I need one of those.
[186:12.14]The cube is too small.
[186:13.14]I dig my hole, you build a wall.
[186:45.02]One day that wall is gonna fall.
[186:50.89]Gonna build that city on a hill.
[186:58.41]On DMCA, I think I'm fine.
[186:59.71]Gonna build that city on a hill.
[187:03.77]One day those tears are gonna spill.
[187:15.51]You can't skip on a live stream.
[187:44.46]Am I allowed to do this?
[187:50.40]I hope so.
[187:52.04]I'm not.
[187:53.35]I've turned it off.
[187:55.13]What are you talking about?
[188:20.70]Nice fucking forehead.
[188:21.90]I'm looking at like the cream cheese here that I have going here.
[188:24.24]Everybody wants to be my enemy.
[188:36.75]I wake up to the sound of the silence that allows my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground.
[188:43.03]Searching to behold the stories that I told.
[188:46.03]My back was to the world that was smiling when I turned.
[188:49.66]I gotta get off camera.
[188:50.22]I feel like I'm, like, dad at the concert with your kids.
[188:54.94]Like, my kids are having a great time, but I'm just here.
[189:00.62]And, like, watching them chaperoning.
[189:02.29]Spare the sympathy.
[189:04.93]Everybody wants to be my enemy.
[189:15.66]I'm not saying anything about the music.
[189:17.22]I'm just saying, like, my reaction there was like, why am I not reacting?
[189:25.49]But I'm ready.
[189:26.47]Words up on the wall.
[189:27.99]Is he praying for my fall?
[189:29.77]Laughter in the hall.
[189:31.19]The names that I've been called.
[189:32.79]I'll stack it in my mind.
[189:34.11]I'm waiting for the time.
[189:36.01]Show you what it's like.
[189:37.09]Give me words made in my mind.
[189:43.77]Arcane is good.
[189:45.09]Yeah, I know.
[189:57.88]Why am I not singing?
[190:01.54]I didn't know we had this many people who hate this band.
[190:16.00]I don't listen to music, so I don't know.
[190:17.80]I don't listen to music, so I don't know.
[190:58.96]No, I really don't listen to music.
[191:01.70]Not that much.
[191:18.42]If you don't listen to music and you don't play games, then what the fuck do you do?
[191:22.57]Cartography.
[191:24.63]My spare time.
[191:25.39]Wood burning.
[191:44.43]Oh my god, that is so great.

[192:03.02]It's important.
[192:04.02]And now, to present the Innovation and Accessibility Award...
[192:07.46]Please welcome Jacksepticeye and a member of our future class for 2020 and one of the judges who helped select the nominees for accessibility.
[192:15.49]The incredible Morgan Baker.
[192:20.11]Jacksepticeye appearance.
[192:23.24]I love Jack.
[192:27.87]Thank you, Jeff.
[192:28.47]It's an honor to be here tonight.
[192:30.77]Games are for everyone, and this award recognizes the teams that are advancing gameplay, features, and technology to make sure games can be accessed and played by all.
[192:42.16]It's incredible to see the effort developers put into prioritizing people who often go ignored, sharing their work with as many people as possible.
[192:50.37]And that's why we love being able to show our gratitude to those who go above and beyond each year, discovering new and creative methods to encourage inclusion.
[192:59.35]Here are the nominees.
[193:01.61]Innovation and Accessibility, presented by Chevrolet.
[193:09.21]In an update that will be coming shortly after launch, players will be able to enable a sign language interpreter.
[193:16.92]I so badly want them just to kind of take the edges and go like, what?
[193:22.72]Not hard, but just like enough.
[193:24.71]Escort the blind girl 500 miles down a treacherous valley in the wake of an invading hold.
[193:31.79]I'm talking about like this like he grabs like the sides and just goes like and it's like game award for innovation inaccessible I really like that I'm serious forza horizon 5. tonight forza horizon 5 also wins best sports slash racing game
[194:07.02]Thank you.
[194:08.58]This award means so much to our team because everyone at Playground Games is really committed to accessibility, so much so that we made it one of our core pillars for Forza Horizon.
[194:20.93]Around the world, there are about a billion players who have some sort of disability that makes gaming a challenge for them.
[194:29.22]And I think it's great that us as developers and as creators can add in accessibility features and options and just open the magic of video games to more and more players.
[194:38.69]It's cars!
[194:39.37]Why do I think that Force is so complicated?
[194:43.33]It's driving a car.
[194:43.95]It's not that complicated.
[194:45.09]I'm gonna get outta here!
[195:09.72]It's three buttons.
[195:10.94]Isn't four to like...
[195:27.54]Yes, it was a great opportunity to show off the game.
[195:31.67]Was it four years ago?
[195:32.59]Yeah.
[195:33.37]Why is he so red?
[195:34.21]Because that was a really, really stupid thing to say.
[195:37.23]Something's about to happen tonight.
[195:38.55]Yes, yes, yes, indeed.
[195:40.18]The thing is, it helped us reach the audience for our...
[195:46.73]extreme co-op horror game.
[195:48.80]Yes.
[195:49.34]And we thought, what better way to announce 1.0?
[195:53.10]We've been in early access now for two years.
[195:55.09]What better way to announce 1.0 than to come back to it?
[195:57.77]No, I'm not on dope right now.
[195:59.35]So the surprise announcement is that...
[196:01.68]GTFO is out now.
[196:02.92]This very minute, we release it right now.
[196:04.82]Someone press the button.
[196:06.36]I am way too red, though.
[196:07.40]Someone's pressing a button right now, and it's out now, and there's no better time to get into GTFO than right now with 25% off, and we worked hard to make the game more accessible.
[196:18.73]Sorry, more accessible.
[196:20.49]Any more lip balm?
[196:21.61]That's not a bad idea.
[196:22.63]Let's take a look.
[196:23.35]We've got something brand new.
[196:24.09]Let's take a look at the trailer, yeah.

[196:29.63]Holy smokes.
[196:42.73]They wake us from our nightmares to make us new ones Descend into a vast underground complex This game rocks where every resource scavenged
[197:11.49]One more chance.
[197:15.23]There's only one rule.
[197:19.43]Bring it what it wants.
[197:23.72]Or die.

[197:27.00]Really.
[197:28.58]Please peep this.
[197:29.50]Peep it, please.
[197:31.26]Where the monsters wait.
[197:56.52]Why are we here?
[197:59.93]What terrible things do we do to deserve such hell?
[198:08.69]I just thought of the person that said that the balls would be a critical hit.
[198:20.09]All we know is we'll have to work together.
[198:26.13]Oh, wow.
[198:33.33]That looks fun.
[198:33.81]It actually looks pretty good.
[198:36.70]I am intrigued for sure.
[198:44.62]So is it that new content or is that just the game is a game that exists?
[198:48.96]I go by Mike the Quad and I stream on Twitch.
[198:51.68]Let's go!
[198:54.13]it's really hard military in 2008 when we came back I was involved in a motorcycle accident trying to figure out how to use a controller without having any hand function what's up everybody that kind of sparked my advocacy I wholeheartedly believe it kickstarts a patient's rehabilitation
[199:31.03]Somebody said, are you a new streamer?
[199:34.72]I just started.
[199:37.20]Probably like 2015.
[199:39.44]I'm fairly new.
[199:45.40]2014?
[199:46.14]I'm pretty new.
[199:53.14]I'll live for thousands of years, so it's pretty new to me in kind of my lifespan.
[199:57.95]Raid Shadow Legends.
[199:59.35]I mean...
[200:01.98]You pick your champions, they're glorious, and their shields, oh, they glisten like wet otters.
[200:08.18]But the bad guys, they're Lovecraftian, they're spooky, they're big.
[200:12.41]And then you go to battle, and it's like... And finally, your foe is vanquished, and that satisfaction is such a primal feeling.
[200:20.75]Wait, Raid Shadow Legends, they got Jeff Goldblum?
[200:30.90]what they even got Jeff goldblum I will don't be surprised if Joe biden does a raid shadow legends ad like at his next conference holy they're everywhere and kill him oh my goodness when we finally hunt the circle yes I'm done running
[201:02.43]Yeah, we have this new deal with Raid Shadow Legends.
[201:07.45]And it's, man, let me tell you, they're paying back half the national debt for me to come up here and talk to you about it.
[201:22.57]The time has come to strike.
[201:33.17]Horvitz.
[201:50.56]Raid Shadow Legends is going to be on the side of Elon Musk's fucking space Mars rocket in huge letters.
[202:02.03]In fact, the aliens that find us eventually are gonna think that the Raid Shadow Legends lore was our actual history as a species.
[202:13.12]That will be their history.
[202:15.20]Of us.
[202:19.62]There won't be a bible anymore.
[202:20.93]It'll be the book of Raid Shadow Legends.
[202:25.45]And all the characters that are in the game and shit.
[202:43.68]Aren't there like content creators in Raid Shadow Legends or something?
[202:48.73]Stop promoting the game for free.
[202:50.55]Guys, me saying the word Raid Shadow Legends, it's like me promoting water to you.
[202:55.69]It's like, hey, there's water exists on Earth.
[202:59.79]It's already, it's everywhere.
[203:01.59]I can't do it anymore.
[203:02.41]What plus?
[203:02.67]Paramount plus?
[203:19.23]What do you mean paramount plus?
[203:23.02]You're special.
[203:23.72]There's another one?
[203:28.28]In fact, I'm counting on it.
[203:38.11]We're lost in the dark.
[203:39.53]But you give people hope.
[203:50.61]And I will always be with you.
[203:53.09]This is her.
[203:55.85]I see this.
[204:02.53]As a new beginning.
[204:18.01]Please welcome the Chief Creative Officer from Epic Games, Donald Mustard.
[204:28.76]That was crazy.
[204:29.58]That was amazing.
[204:31.60]Alright.
[204:32.81]So making games that are original, innovative, and really push the medium forward is not easy at all.
[204:39.51]It's the culmination of the work and the talent of hundreds and hundreds of people and countless hours.
[204:46.36]And it only happens when there's a clear shared vision of what a game can be.
[204:52.78]These nominees for best game direction represent what's possible when it all comes together.
[204:57.57]Oh, I want to be on cam for this one.

[205:12.00]Is anyone listening?
[205:14.10]It's Celine.

[205:21.83]I'm like, I've just touched my- what's going on?
[205:23.17]Deathloop, alright.
[205:45.75]You're dehydrated.
[205:48.03]Dude, I drank this big-ass water over the last hour or two.
[205:51.92]It's like 40 ounces.
[205:53.36]It's huge.
[205:55.24]I am not dehydrated.
[206:00.70]Yeah, so Deathloop is my first game as a game director.
[206:06.48]And it's also the first game that Sebastian and I are co-creative director for.
[206:13.59]And actually, I don't mean that as a brag.
[206:17.79]It was terrifying.
[206:18.79]Terrifying for us, terrifying for the team.
[206:22.77]It looks like you made it a plastic.
[206:24.11]So yeah, I really want to thank the Arcane Lyon team for taking the leap of faith of giving their best work to, you know,
[206:39.38]to make this strange game that no one can sum up in 30 seconds.
[206:45.62]I should play this.
[206:46.14]I heard it was really good.
[206:49.22]Yeah, and also thank you to PlayStation.
[206:52.18]You believed in our vision.
[206:54.76]Thank you to our fans.
[206:56.39]Actually, I have a lot of people to thank, but not a lot of time.
[207:02.33]Can we make those 30 seconds loop a couple of times?
[207:05.71]Okay.
[207:08.67]That was a good one.
[207:09.35]That was good.
[207:10.41]I'll stop here, but just throw me a small last word for my family in French.
[207:17.68]So, Lilia, Aya, Papa, Maman, je vous aime tr√®s fort.

[209:22.15]I don't want to be spoiled.
[209:24.69]Thanks, buddy.
[209:25.57]Let's check it out.
[209:38.40]It happened an age ago.
[209:46.83]But when I recall, I see it true.
[209:54.46]On a night of wintry fog, the rune of death was stolen.
[210:13.40]And the demigods began to fall.
[210:18.66]Starting with Godwyn the Golden.
[210:31.15]Queen Marika was driven to the brink.
[210:47.02]The shattering ensued, a war that wrought only darkness.
[210:52.51]The Elden Ring was broken.
[210:55.53]But by whom?
[210:57.49]And why?
[211:19.96]What could the demigods ever hope to win by war?
[211:43.53]The Conqueror of the Stars, General Radar.
[211:48.48]And the Blade of Mikkel at Millenia the Seventh.
[211:59.31]These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.
[212:20.10]But there would be no victor.
[212:30.73]And so, we inhabit a fractured world.
[212:33.43]Awaiting the arrival of the Elden World.
[212:43.46]Unless, of course, thou shouldst take the crown.
[213:00.37]I didn't say anything was it good good just confirming the date the same February okay excellent good to see you amazing I can't wait to step deeper into the world of Elden Ring uh when it does come out in February tonight we've teamed up with Spotify to reveal what you're listening to every day on gaming consoles as part of Spotify's wrapped rage shadow Spotify two songs in 2021 on gaming surfaces here are the top three

[216:00.73]I was like, what the fuck am I watching?
[216:01.91]They were dumping stuff on her?

[216:14.43]I'm just going to open it to get ready.
[216:17.09]I promise I'm not going to play it.
[216:18.17]I'm just going to open it.
[216:29.06]I'm not playing it.
[216:36.03]I just want to make sure it's in the background.
[216:46.91]Not going to put it in the corner either.
[217:06.10]Just getting it ready.
[217:16.74]Please split screen.
[217:17.71]No, I can't do that.
[217:19.43]We have literally 10 minutes.
[217:22.75]I have to go pee anyways.
[217:23.99]I'm holding it.
[217:24.57]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[217:33.22]I'm gonna shoot you right down.
[217:36.93]Go pee now.
[217:37.37]Actually, this is a good time to go pee.
[217:39.31]Because the game is always in the background as it adds, right?
[217:41.26]Alright, I'll be right back.
[217:43.64]Here we go.
[217:53.00]Boom, boom, boom.
[217:59.07]I'm gonna shoot you right down.
[218:02.93]Bang, bang.
[218:26.78]Bang, bang, bang.
[218:57.29]Hey, everyone.
[218:57.75]My name is Art Debo.
[218:58.53]My go-to is probably going to be It Takes Two.
[219:00.71]Hi, everybody.
[219:01.75]My pick is Psychonauts 2.
[219:03.17]Going to have to give it to Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart.
[219:05.41]A pure joyride of fun from start to finish, and that's hard to beat.
[219:15.93]That was a look at which Game of the Year nominees YouTube creators and fans want to see win later tonight.
[219:20.39]We'll find out if they are right when we present Game of the Year.
[219:23.59]Every year at the Game Awards, we try to find games that push the medium forward in new and unexpected ways.
[219:27.63]This game comes from Embark Studios in Sweden, a new team of veteran developers.
[219:32.27]Their first game brings together thrilling multiplayer PvE action, a next-generation physical sandbox, and incredible visuals to create a truly dynamic player experience.
[219:41.25]Here is the reveal, complete with real gameplay.
[219:51.58]I'm back.
[219:51.90]I'm back.
[219:52.20]I'm back.
[219:52.48]I'm here.
[219:52.76]I'm here.
[219:53.60]What did I miss?
[219:59.47]What did I miss?
[220:01.59]There is no way to hide.
[220:04.27]Kings.
[220:05.87]Barons.
[220:07.39]Queens.
[220:09.09]We give them different names, but they're all the same.
[220:14.24]Killing machines falling from the sky.
[220:18.58]This is our home.
[220:22.08]our bastion of resistance this is where the brave meets the bold I was in the bathroom somebody said why does this person not talk die in the shadows we will face our fears head on showtime
[220:58.99]I can't resize it unless I can see it.
[221:00.79]That's just part of the trailer.
[221:32.40]What the fuck?
[221:38.00]What is this?
[221:38.54]What is this game?
[221:39.46]This kind of looks like EDF with robots.
[221:43.75]New contact.
[221:55.99]Breaking orbit.
[221:57.01]Southern Rust Belt.
[221:58.55]They will never stop coming.
[222:07.72]Whoa.
[222:10.27]Somebody write this down.
[222:10.93]It's called ARC Raiders.
[222:36.65]That was incredible.
[222:37.81]And now we have two special guests joining us for a very special moment.
[222:42.17]Carrie-Anne, Keanu, welcome.
[222:44.88]I'm sure you guys recognize this iconic scene moment, right?
[222:50.32]Jeff, thank you.
[222:51.72]It's good to be here at the Game Awards.
[222:53.50]And yes, this is one of the scenes that made The Matrix feel so groundbreaking and perhaps inspired a few video games too.
[223:00.51]It's true.
[223:04.45]It's true.
[223:08.30]Impressive.
[223:08.80]Thanks.
[223:09.60]Can you still do that?
[223:10.60]Absolutely not.
[223:11.86]But I can in the Unreal Engine 5.
[223:15.55]I believe everyone here is expecting to see something new, so here's a never-before-seen look at the Matrix Resurrection, exclusively for the Game Awards.
[223:24.32]2021!
[223:25.18]Let's roll the clip.
[223:26.54]Him and Jim Carrey have the same energy tonight.
[223:39.16]Where are we?
[223:40.64]Tokyo.
[223:41.86]A moving portal makes it harder to track us.
[223:43.08]I love both of these guys, by the way.
[223:44.24]Seeker's the best of them.
[223:45.21]Portal's clean.
[223:46.15]We do no shadows.
[223:49.35]I don't remember this.
[223:51.95]We don't have to run to phone booths anymore either.
[224:03.78]Door's on your right.
[224:19.39]Set and setting, right?
[224:22.01]Oh, no.
[224:23.21]It's all about set and setting.
[224:26.91]After our first contact went so badly, we thought elements from your past might help ease you into the present.
[224:32.76]Nothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia.
[224:40.26]The Matrix Resurrections looks awesome, and we can't wait to watch it on December 22nd.
[224:44.34]I kind of feel like they got DMCA'd midstream.
[224:50.31]If not, you're not watching this movie.
[224:54.17]Did you ever think that one day a game could look as real as being in the Matrix?
[224:59.39]Absolutely.
[225:01.01]I mean, we are reaching the point at which the line between the physical and virtual worlds are blurry.
[225:08.32]And with interactive storytelling reaching stunning levels of fidelity, maybe it's fair to ask, what is a game?
[225:16.52]What is a movie?
[225:17.97]Over 20 years ago, the Matrix pushed the boundaries of filmmaking and visual effects.
[225:22.95]We couldn't have imagined where the state of the art would be today with photorealistic digital humans in virtual sets.
[225:29.81]In fact, if you didn't tell me, Jim Carrey could be dressed up as Keanu Reeves, and Keanu Reeves could have been dressed up in makeup as Jim Carrey.
[225:36.64]They just didn't tell anybody.
[225:38.14]Experience, experience, experience.
[225:59.96]Are you serious?
[226:31.51]Oh, is it not a game?
[226:33.05]It's just like, it's just the Spider-Man Homecoming VR thing.
[226:38.82]Is it a game?
[226:39.52]It's playable.
[226:40.30]Everything you just saw is running in real time on Unreal Engine 5, on PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It is pretty mind-blowing.
[226:47.88]And now you can download and experience The Matrix Awakens for yourself for free right now.
[226:53.22]It looks really good, though.
[226:53.82]In its entirety, it's available right now.
[226:55.60]Make sure to play it.
[226:56.36]It is mind-blowing.
[226:58.02]Epic has just taken things to another level.
[226:59.70]Play it tonight, please.
[227:01.02]It did look pretty.
[227:01.50]His face was insane.
[227:02.63]Game of the year.
[227:03.25]Thanks, Jeff.
[227:26.85]Man, it feels awesome to be back here together in person.
[227:30.10]Congratulations to everyone who managed to release a game this year.
[227:33.56]Perseverance, dedication, and passion are inspiring, and there's no shortage of that in this room.
[227:39.76]Now performing music from each of tonight's Game of the Year nominees, once again, the Game Awards Orchestra.
[227:44.98]Alright, who are the nominees?
[227:59.79]Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart
[228:31.16]Takes two.
[228:34.74]I don't have to give 100 community subs.
[228:38.02]Oh.
[228:39.28]I don't have to give 100 community subs.
[228:45.59]Alright, does it count if I played it or does it count if I purchased it?
[228:48.41]Or does it count if I got like a cut on my hand from the box that it came in?
[228:53.93]Like I haven't even played it.
[229:06.17]I did play three games.
[229:07.25]It was Resident Evil 8.
[229:17.76]Here's two more.
[229:20.44]Hitman and Far Cry 6.
[229:23.62]I'm good.
[229:38.34]Here it is.
[229:39.92]Far Cry 6, Resident Evil Village, and you said the other one.
[229:50.75]Whatever it was.
[229:52.29]WarioWare.
[229:53.27]Genshin Impact.
[229:55.59]I played like four games.
[230:07.19]No more heroes didn't get nominated for any of it.
[230:22.18]You said nominated.
[230:23.08]Yeah, Far Cry 6 got nominated.
[230:24.61]Genshin Impact got nominated.
[230:28.77]I played Genshin Impact.
[230:29.71]Oh yeah.
[230:30.35]For at least a few hours.
[230:31.27]Not on stream.
[230:35.83]Sorry, guys.
[230:42.23]One hour.
[230:42.63]So what?
[230:43.23]I played it.
[230:43.69]That game actually kind of looks... That looks fun.
[231:10.39]Stay extremely mad, chat.
[231:18.15]You think everything looks fun?
[231:24.58]Get an actual opinion.
[231:27.36]I think I said like three things on the stream looked fun.
[231:34.26]I said something looked cute, something looks interesting.
[231:36.88]We're being shown like five dozen trailers for new games.
[231:42.86]Well, I'm gonna, of course I'm gonna be like, ah, it looks alright.
[231:45.36]That looks cool.
[231:46.02]That looks cute.
[231:49.57]There's so many games.
[231:50.51]Oh, I thought they were gonna do it one more time.
[231:52.47]Encore, do it again.
[232:04.90]I've talked a lot of shit too.
[232:06.04]I have.
[232:10.86]And finally, congratulations to all of tonight's nominees.
[232:13.98]All pretty incredible games.
[232:15.88]And the 2021 game of the year is... If Deathloop doesn't win, I'm going to streak on stream.
[232:20.30]It takes two.
[232:24.92]That's actually awesome.
[232:30.42]That's actually awesome.
[232:31.40]I'm so happy.
[232:32.28]I can't wait to hear what he has to say.
[232:37.58]That's a big plot twist, it is.
[232:39.39]That's a huge deal.
[232:39.99]It's so unreal, this thing.
[232:45.71]I was up at that stage in 2017, saying, fuck the Oscars, and now... Actually, in a way, the Oscars got fucked, because the Game Awards are getting way better.
[232:59.18]I know there are 30 seconds.
[233:00.78]I'm going to be extremely fast, so I want to thank my... Let me see.
[233:05.86]My beautiful team for a fantastic... Yeah, he's awesome.
[233:08.70]I can't do anything.
[233:09.84]They deserve it.
[233:10.31]I want to say also, I want to give this award to my daughter, Mio, and my soon-to-come daughter, Zoe.
[233:16.79]It's so nice to have children.
[233:17.99]I'm surprised how much you love them.
[233:19.55]If you don't have children, go get them.
[233:21.09]I mean, this is the best thing that can happen.
[233:23.47]Thank you again.
[233:24.21]I'm really proud.
[233:24.83]I'm shaking.
[233:25.39]Look at me, man.
[233:26.09]This is like a big, big moment for me.
[233:28.36]And Neil, you're a big inspiration.
[233:30.60]Thank you.
[233:31.46]Thank you.
[233:36.16]You know what?
[233:40.37]He said what he wanted to say.
[233:41.43]And was like, this is great.
[233:42.77]This is huge.
[233:43.37]That's great.
[233:43.93]That's good.
[233:44.45]That's really cool.
[233:46.40]I want to see.
[233:46.84]That guy's got like 500 IQ genius level shit going on up here.
[234:08.85]Yeah.
[234:09.11]No.
[234:09.25]Good for him.
[234:09.73]Seriously.
[234:11.21]Good for that studio.
