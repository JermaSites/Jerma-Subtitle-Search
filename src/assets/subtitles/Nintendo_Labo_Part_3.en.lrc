[00:02.25]Hey!
[00:04.69]Hey, howdy doody, how you doing?
[00:08.53]Jerma here.
[00:11.05]Welcome to another edition of building things out of cardboard.
[00:17.09]And being young again.
[00:18.59]Because this time we get to wear this one.
[00:23.35]I looked at the back of the box.
[00:25.31]You put this shit on.
[00:29.54]I'm going to be in full virtual reality robot cardboard outfit.
[00:35.04]How embarrassing.
[00:39.71]You know, I think about stuff like that.
[00:40.95]We'll talk about this in a minute.
[00:42.93]Give me two seconds.
[00:43.55]Just set now.
[00:44.77]Be right there.
[01:37.67]Okay.
[01:39.01]So.
[01:39.15]Let me move this out of the way.
[01:45.89]And let's bring this over here.
[01:47.13]Why not?
[01:47.53]We're ready to go.
[01:48.15]Hey!
[01:51.60]How's everybody doing?
[01:52.50]I'm doing just fine.
[02:00.38]Didn't spill one drop, by the way.
[02:04.59]Get a bit of microscope and look.
[02:08.10]I'm wearing sweatpants.
[02:09.00]I am wearing sweatpants because of you jokers.
[02:14.62]Didn't spill one drop, by the way.
[02:19.06]Find it.
[02:19.72]I don't see it.
[02:20.22]Gonna need a little more.
[02:27.68]He's mixing.
[02:28.67]Yes, I'm mixing because I want it to last.
[02:31.29]I don't want to just slam alcohol right now.
[02:34.13]Guys, give me a break.
[02:38.46]Honestly, that was there before I started.
[02:39.77]There's a condensation for the bottom of this thing.
[02:45.85]No, because you want me to drink that whole thing right now?
[02:48.70]You want the stream to be over in 25 minutes?
[02:52.24]Yeah, that was there before.
[03:08.06]So something that I thought of, we may have talked about this before, but it's a very, very interesting topic.
[03:16.36]So your grandmother and your grandfather, there are pictures of your grandfather that are in black and white, right?
[03:28.13]You maybe have like three photos of grandpappy
[03:33.20]Maybe two of your great-grandfather that are actually, oh, wow, this is when he was a kid.
[03:37.12]Wow.
[03:38.11]That's so odd.
[03:38.71]I wonder what kind of a guy he was.
[03:41.33]Think about it.
[03:43.27]When I have, you know, great-great-great-grandchildren, it's not going to be like a black-and-white blurry photo of some guy in a fucking suit.
[03:52.49]No.
[03:53.45]They're going to have, like, VODs to look at about me dressed up in a fucking children's Halloween costume.
[03:59.27]That's terrifying, isn't it?
[04:03.18]Think about, like, 100 years, 200 years in the future.
[04:06.89]Oh, wow, let's look up a great-great-grandpappy Jeremy.
[04:10.19]Oh, wow, I wonder, like, black and white... Nope.
[04:12.83]It's me, like, pretending to throw up in my mouth and eat it.
[04:18.23]Think about, like, the Facebook selfies that you've seen of, like, friends of yours.
[04:23.13]That shit's gonna be... You'll be able to see that.
[04:26.48]You won't be dusted off old fucking shoeboxes of fucking your grandparents' photos.
[04:32.16]That's so weird.
[04:34.23]From now on, we're just going to do educational streams.
[04:36.91]Because I want the one random chance that my great-great-great-grandchildren scroll through and pick the random stream.
[04:43.23]It's me doing like a lecture.
[04:44.43]You know what I mean?
[04:45.05]Look at what an intellectual grandpa was.
[04:51.89]Anyways, let's play with the kid's toy for like four hours.
[04:57.60]Right, kids?
[04:58.34]Right, grandkids?
[05:01.36]Put it in a capsule.
[05:02.08]You ready?
[05:03.85]Just want to tell you.
[05:05.53]My great, great, wonderful grandchildren.
[05:08.01]Just want to let you know.
[05:09.65]Hope the world is really cool and interesting.
[05:11.90]Flying cars.
[05:12.80]Whoa, you can fly around in cars?
[05:13.96]We didn't have that.
[05:14.76]No?
[05:15.50]But just want to let you know that great, great, great, great, great granddad loves you.
[05:19.06]And by the way, the treasure map is stored under the bed.
[05:25.44]Good luck.
[05:26.60]Not going to tell you whose bed.
[05:30.25]There's $200,000 there.
[05:33.09]which by the way, might be only worth about six bucks now, but it's an adventure you can go on with your friends.
[05:48.34]I'm ready, let's go.
[05:49.70]Let's make the robot.
[05:53.26]Make, we're gonna start very simple.
[05:57.80]Six bucks, yeah, with hyperinflation, right?
[06:01.38]Cost of the goods go up.
[06:02.94]The cost of living goes up.
[06:05.01]200 grand becomes like 20 bucks.
[06:10.17]Oh, by the way, you're not getting the music that loud tonight.
[06:14.27]It's weird having no headphones in because I can't hear this.
[06:17.54]It's like, I'm in a silent row.
[06:21.90]Alright, robot kid.
[06:23.20]Toy-Con robot.
[06:24.06]We're going to, this is, look at it.
[06:26.94]This is all we're doing.
[06:31.03]That's gonna take a long time.
[06:33.79]Blast the music and, alright, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, easy.
[06:38.70]The music can come up that high, like 5%, that's okay.
[06:40.92]Alright, there are eight steps altogether to be in the fun robot suit.
[06:49.22]Louder, no, you're not getting it louder.
[06:54.12]So what do we got?
[06:54.56]We got the HD headset, the four fingers.
[07:01.27]We make a backpack.
[07:05.03]The backpack and then turn, wait, so this is just a... This isn't a robot.
[07:13.03]This is like a shitty book bag.
[07:16.81]What?
[07:21.14]I wanna be that guy.
[07:25.04]This is like something you bring a school lunch to school with.
[07:34.18]You put my fucking math book in here.
[07:36.34]Okay, let's go.
[07:38.51]Take out the plastic bag of the special parts.
[07:40.39]You don't need to open the bag yet.
[07:41.73]You mean this thing?
[07:48.13]Sure.
[07:53.09]One out of eight.
[07:53.71]I'm ready.
[07:55.04]Making the visor.
[07:57.80]That's what my GameCube is for.
[08:01.10]You know, by the way, kids, you're watching.
[08:03.88]This is the one you picked.
[08:06.18]What is it like?
[08:08.29]I mean, you can't tell me, but what's it like now?
[08:11.43]Do you still build cardboard robots?
[08:14.25]Or do you get to pretend to be a robot, like the guy on the cover?
[08:17.17]What's it like now?
[08:19.35]Somebody wrote an article about this guy.
[08:20.83]Like, whoa, we went blast from the past.
[08:22.53]Talks about the Labo.
[08:23.51]The Labo 8, you can build it.
[08:25.62]It's out of metal.
[08:26.70]It's a little welding kit.
[08:29.32]They're gonna laugh at grandpa while he plays with his fucking dumb shitty toys.
[08:33.74]Yeah, I'm talking to the future.
[08:37.20]You guys think this is a joke?
[08:39.72]500 years from now, someone's gonna click this, someone's gonna find it, and it's gonna be a world to them.
[08:45.36]It's gonna be like going back in the past and seeing, like first of all, you ain't gonna have fingernails.
[08:51.00]Guys, take a look at that.
[08:52.79]Interesting, huh?
[08:54.57]You don't have those anymore.
[08:56.51]Those have been evolutionized out.
[08:58.58]See, you're not going to have these in like 5,000 years.
[09:02.05]It's been proven by science already.
[09:05.45]See, I just blew all of your minds.
[09:07.71]I'm not even talking to the chat anymore.
[09:09.17]I'm talking to the people in the future.
[09:11.61]I'm talking to future chat, not you guys.
[09:14.65]It's your birthday?
[09:15.19]Happy birthday.
[09:17.71]I don't need this yet.
[09:18.43]This is for the VOD chat from like the 2800... A...
[09:27.81]C, after Christ.
[09:28.91]No, before... Who's going to be like the new Christ, right?
[09:33.51]So this is probably like BCC, right?
[09:37.21]This is probably like before cool Christ.
[09:39.29]It's probably like another one, right?
[09:40.67]You have to assume.
[09:41.31]It's been like a thousand years ago.
[09:44.99]Right?
[09:45.55]Think about that.
[09:49.07]Or before like chaos Christ, right?
[09:52.82]The world ain't going to exist in like a thousand years.
[09:54.48]It's going to be owned by chaos Christ.
[09:57.74]There's gonna be some weird fucked up thing where like in the Bible, it was like, holy shit, that was right.
[10:01.44]This one line.
[10:04.32]Alright, we need two pieces from sheets A and B. I got them both here.
[10:09.32]No, I don't.
[10:13.28]Yeah, hey, no, turns out, turns out the entire plot of Metal Gear Solid was real.
[10:21.35]Hey, he was right.
[10:22.05]Alright, so this is, we need it right here.
[10:25.19]What the fuck do we need?
[10:29.65]This ain't right, that's not correct.
[10:32.25]So wait, we need A, A and B, these two, right?
[10:41.20]Ah, okay.
[10:44.36]A, I gotta get this out of here.
[10:48.46]I just scared a lot of people.
[10:50.06]Alright, so this is coming out right here.
[10:51.78]Just shatter the glass against the wall.
[10:59.64]Yeah.
[11:01.08]So this is not, by the way, remember I told you this is going to be like 12 hours?
[11:04.22]That's not true.
[11:05.74]This actually is estimated, this whole thing is estimated to take only about three hours.
[11:10.25]So let's stretch it out as far as we fucking can.
[11:12.55]Yeah, I mean, I thought this was going to take like 12 hours.
[11:20.61]Nope.
[11:21.41]It's going to be like four.
[11:26.14]Did you hear that sound, guys?
[11:27.89]You guys like that sound.
[11:28.93]I remember back when we did this before and all the wonderful, nice comments people were saying about me.
[11:35.51]I remember that.
[11:36.93]All too well.
[11:37.47]Alright, don't forget, if you have any trouble, you can use the back and forward buttons.
[11:41.91]Yeah, I know.
[11:42.61]I've played it before.
[11:43.89]I should have been able to check the box that said, I'm a veteran of Nintendo Labo.
[11:48.06]Alright.
[11:49.33]Use your visor to control your robot head.
[11:52.15]That sounds pretty cool, huh?
[11:53.95]Okay, let's start with the piece that says Labo on it.
[11:58.87]The Labo sucks.
[12:03.14]You just got to bear with me for one day, okay?
[12:06.58]I probably would have shit-canned this whole stream.
[12:08.86]I got the double cam set up.
[12:10.32]I got the fucking switch down here.
[12:11.68]This is $80, okay?
[12:14.04]Bear with me for a day.
[12:17.34]I bought a switch for this.
[12:19.12]This was a $500 stream.
[12:21.19]So just, you have to, three streams, 500 bucks.
[12:23.27]Bear with me here.
[12:23.77]Okay.
[12:25.49]What am I drinking?
[12:26.15]Oh, I didn't even show you!
[12:31.99]Wrong way.
[12:32.55]And it's backwards.
[12:34.36]Just pretend that's a different language.
[12:36.40]It's Johnny Walker Red.
[12:40.08]Let's see how it smells.
[12:43.18]Ah, it smells pretty good.
[12:46.96]Here's the wine.
[12:47.42]That's not wine.
[12:47.92]That's Johnny Walker Red.
[12:49.36]Blue is way better.
[12:50.24]Yes, it is.
[12:51.66]Blue is also, it doesn't come in bottles like that, and it's fucking expensive.
[12:54.85]So, alright.
[12:56.25]Why don't we stretch out this four-hour robot any longer than we have to?
[12:58.91]Alright, let's go.
[12:59.99]Labo, right there.
[13:00.77]That's the one.
[13:01.21]Can you see it?
[13:01.63]I mean, you kind of can.
[13:03.89]When the sun goes down, I'll turn the exposure up, but there you go.
[13:07.24]Why is this backwards?
[13:19.74]Dear Chaos Christ.
[13:22.74]I gotta stop that shit because I'm probably pissing somebody off.
[13:25.80]I'm sorry.
[13:26.12]I don't mean that for real.
[13:28.66]Alright.
[13:29.36]Let's go.
[13:33.60]Wouldn't Chaos Christ be Satan?
[13:39.75]No.
[13:40.29]Well, they're opposites, right?
[13:41.17]Wouldn't the whole thing that Jesus split in two and his bad side went down and the good side went up
[13:52.92]I don't mean, I'm just kidding around.
[13:55.32]I'm a jokester.
[13:57.12]I'm a comedy jokester.
[13:59.00]None of this is real.
[14:00.52]I respect... Negative.
[14:11.95]No, I gotta quiet.
[14:13.31]I'm being like an unnecessary dick.
[14:18.79]Do you like how I vacuumed the floor, though?
[14:22.84]How dare you?
[14:24.47]No.
[14:25.71]God knows when you're telling a lie.
[14:27.49]Don't you understand?
[14:29.39]He knows when you're telling the truth and when you're telling a lie.
[14:33.05]That's why he invented Santa.
[14:35.82]Because he didn't want to do all that shit.
[14:37.28]He hired a guy to keep tabs on everybody.
[14:40.22]They were good.
[14:40.98]They got toys.
[14:44.12]That's way too much to have to think about on a day-to-day basis.
[14:48.53]Think about that, right?
[14:51.43]Alright, fold the lines in nice and tight.
[14:56.77]Yeah, we're doing all of it.
[14:59.55]They all have to be turned.
[15:00.43]Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[15:01.73]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15:03.17]Okay, so these are coming out.
[15:05.84]Let's show you how I do a nice fold here.
[15:09.50]How's that look to you guys?
[15:10.68]Pretty bad because the glare.
[15:14.06]Whatever, like five of you think this is cool, so whatever.
[15:16.50]For the five people in here that actually like this, me too.
[15:22.44]Stab on the haters as they say Murder no, I'm talking about like you in a video game when you've all wouldn't be one somebody in PvP Chaotic There we go, alright then this comes across
[15:54.76]And then I'm assuming I'm going to plug this in.
[15:59.64]Right in there.
[16:00.64]This is going to feel so nice.
[16:01.90]I can't wait to feel this.
[16:05.13]Like that.
[16:05.63]Look at this.
[16:07.01]Check it.
[16:12.49]I missed it.
[16:13.67]Oh, I missed this.
[16:15.45]I missed doing this.
[16:19.26]And then that turns around.
[16:19.96]It's going to stick in there.
[16:34.34]Put it in, put it in.
[16:36.36]How's my posture, is it bad?
[16:38.75]Is it bad today?
[16:40.87]My back has been hurting, I gotta keep my posture up.
[16:42.63]Alright, so flip it around.
[16:43.45]Now, Sam, the other piece, start with the printed side facing down.
[16:46.79]Yeah, I know.
[16:50.01]$50, $50 just came in.
[16:52.47]Hold on, I gotta click.
[16:56.81]50 bucks from Kristen.
[16:59.01]Kristen, thank you for the $50.
[17:03.14]Great hair, great stream.
[17:04.52]Drink up and build that robot.
[17:06.06]We're all drinking too.
[17:07.16]Cool guy.
[17:07.78]That would have been cool if I caught that.
[17:12.84]But thank you so much, Kristen.
[17:15.23]Thank you for the $500 billion.
[17:19.49]Because, I mean, it could go either way, right?

[17:28.06]How much is that?
[17:29.36]That's like $400 million right now.
[17:31.39]It could go both ways.
[17:32.11]It could be a depreciating or appreciating currency, right?
[17:36.79]Let me know in the comments section what the currency depreciation is ratio.
[17:43.87]And then you probably have time travel at this point.
[17:45.85]Send it back to me and let me know.

[22:13.18]Okay, I'm placing the bag over here on the desk.
[22:18.74]I'm placing big bag with wires over behind the red label alcohol.
[22:25.14]Don't forget that.
[22:25.86]Thank you.
[22:28.16]What is a grommet?
[22:28.80]It's this thing.
[22:32.71]Alright, let's attach it through here, I'm going to assume, right?
[22:34.97]Wait, what the fuck is this?
[22:38.11]Wait, I was supposed to fold this in half.
[22:39.45]Okay, well, that's... Sorry.
[22:41.25]I didn't fold anything.
[22:42.11]Do you remember as a sword guy?
[22:54.70]No, I'm more of a spellcaster, I think.
[23:00.40]Yeah, I definitely would be more of like a sit back and like cast like disease of warlock or something.
[23:08.53]Alright, I missed this whole thing.
[23:11.27]I gotta go back.
[23:11.77]I missed the entire instructional booklet.
[23:15.67]Okay, so just to go like this.
[23:18.97]And then this just comes across.
[23:21.85]Just like this.
[23:27.44]It's like too big though.
[23:30.44]It's a little too big.
[23:31.14]How are they going to expect you to do this?
[23:33.50]It's too big.
[23:34.22]Fucking game's dumb.
[23:37.08]Alright, let's go.
[23:40.66]Yeah, it washes.
[23:41.86]Washes right through the middle here.
[23:44.51]Check this one out.
[23:46.71]That's right.
[23:47.29]Satisfying sounds.
[23:49.29]My new Twitch channel.
[23:50.13]Please follow it.
[23:50.97]twitch.tv/satisfying sounds.
[23:55.93]And this is going to fold over.
[23:57.30]Oh, let's go ahead and combine the two pieces.
[23:59.30]Hey, buddy.
[24:00.59]Hey buddy, long time no see, how are you?
[24:03.89]Now this goes like this through here.
[24:15.36]Look at that, that's gonna feel so nice.
[24:20.44]Perfect, looking good.
[24:24.10]Then, oh yeah, you wanna bend these a little on the wings left and right to make things easier.
[24:27.82]So bend these up
[24:31.39]And then this up, like that.
[24:33.45]I need to attach the washer.
[24:38.26]Snap the washer in place.
[24:41.24]Stink, okay.
[24:43.16]By the way, if you accidentally put the eyelet together wrong, don't, just ask somebody that's a grownup and they'll come over and be very upset that you were interrupting their football game.
[24:55.22]Hey dad, can you come in here and click on the washer for me?
[25:06.96]Alright, let's go.
[25:09.42]I think I'm doing it wrong, Dad.
[25:14.54]Dad!
[25:16.20]I got it!
[25:16.62]You don't have to come in anymore!
[25:17.73]Alright, so I got it.
[25:24.15]The right side of the visor is done.
[25:27.69]There we are.
[25:28.03]Alright, let me know when it starts to get a little too dark here, because I'm going to zoom in and I'm going to brighten.
[25:35.44]Alright, remove this one piece from sheet A. That's the one with the eyeballs, right?
[25:41.22]Sheet A, no, that's not the right one.
[25:43.16]It's this one.
[25:47.10]Pop.
[25:47.98]At the moment, you guys get to see it.
[25:49.28]Is it, it's too dark now?
[25:50.16]We got big money again?
[25:51.24]Oh my fucking God.
[25:56.89]I missed more big money?
[25:57.93]Oh shit, I did.
[26:02.63]Eleanor.
[26:04.98]Eleanor, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[26:08.56]I want the emojis.
[26:11.70]What emojis?
[26:13.96]Emojis?
[26:19.12]Like the things in chat?
[26:20.46]Or the movie?
[26:22.47]Thank you so much, Eleanor, for the $50.
[26:26.65]My God.
[26:31.07]That's like hundreds of dollars in the first 20 minutes of the stream.
[26:37.27]You guys are too kind.
[26:38.71]Thank you so much.
[26:42.01]What do you mean by emojis, though?
[26:43.93]I got plenty here.
[26:49.96]Like that.
[26:50.34]Don't pop out the eyes, right?
[26:52.48]Or you'll go to jail.
[26:54.78]Don't pop out anybody's eyes.
[26:55.86]It's not nice.
[26:57.64]Did I play L.A.
[26:58.34]Noire?
[26:58.50]I've never played L.A.
[26:59.26]Noire.
[26:59.76]I have no idea how it works.
[27:01.99]I know you go, like, you're a liar, and they fucking yell at you and grab you and stuff.
[27:04.77]That's all I know.
[27:05.77]Alright, so I do have to pop this out.
[27:09.97]Like that.
[27:10.27]Like this.
[27:12.16]Alright.
[27:12.70]I think it's time to brighten and zoom in.
[27:13.86]What do you think?
[27:16.80]I think so.
[27:27.64]Played in VR.
[27:35.73]That's a little bit better probably, right?
[27:42.78]That's better, right?
[27:43.70]Brightened and zoomed in?
[27:45.62]You can see it now in all its glory?
[27:51.22]What, I got a zit on my shoulder?
[27:53.73]Where?
[27:56.91]No one said that.
[27:59.41]I did.
[28:02.21]Okay.
[28:02.57]Hold on to this.
[28:05.93]You're going to need that later, kids.
[28:08.02]So let's flip this around.
[28:09.10]Middle part of the visor with the printed side facing up.
[28:11.86]Crease these two little faux lines on the screen.
[28:15.79]Sure.
[28:17.83]Like this.
[28:22.37]Big bits again.
[28:28.37]LightningRider gave $15.
[28:29.21]Thank you, LightningRider and all your fucking subs.
[28:33.14]I'm about to have been here for seven years, and I'm grateful for everything that has come from Jerma and this community.
[28:39.82]So I gave 31 subs.
[28:42.60]jermaHeart.
[28:45.51]Well, that is something that nobody could have ever asked for, but definitely appreciate.
[28:50.29]So thank you, man.
[28:51.95]Thank you for your extreme amount of contributions and your community subs.
[28:57.43]Thank you, dude.
[29:00.16]This is visor.
[29:02.28]Look at all those hearts, see?
[29:04.80]What am I talking about?
[29:11.50]Wait, hold on, flatten that out.
[29:14.92]That's what I'm talking about.
[29:20.53]Fold those.
[29:22.61]Pop out the ears.
[29:24.09]Don't want that junk in there.
[29:25.51]I got a haircut, by the way.
[29:27.51]You didn't even notice my hair?
[29:37.49]Sorry.
[29:37.93]Alright, fold those fold lines in.
[29:42.91]Fold in the tan lines.
[29:45.25]As you can see, fold it up.
[29:48.35]Fold the top bit over the top bit bit.
[29:49.87]Like that.
[29:56.35]I noticed I didn't want to be mean.
[29:57.51]Why, you don't like it?
[30:00.79]I might as well just shave it all off.
[30:02.73]Whoa, whoa, whoa, we got the hand coming in?
[30:04.63]Wait, hold on.
[30:05.82]So this now comes over here.
[30:08.70]That's going to stick.
[30:09.30]Ooh, look at that.
[30:11.74]See the triangular opening on the end of the right-hand part?
[30:14.02]Slide the tab on the middle part in there so that the R marks overlap.
[30:19.59]So like that.
[30:24.85]So like this.
[30:29.23]Like this.
[30:36.22]I need to think of a dad in here for this.
[30:39.70]that comes out and slides in.
[30:43.57]So like this, and it slides in here.
[30:51.85]So fuck, okay, hold on.
[30:55.34]So this is like this at this point, right?
[30:58.44]So like that, there we go.
[31:00.46]Okay, hold on, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
[31:13.18]Dad, you don't have to come in anymore!
[31:14.80]Shut the fuck up!
[31:24.25]And then this... I thought that was me saying that to Dad, not him saying it to me.
[31:31.69]But you guys are saying, I am Dad.
[31:33.15]I'm both of them.
[31:34.09]I'm both of us.
[31:41.41]There's two of us in here.
[31:46.13]Then this goes around.
[31:50.94]We have become one.
[31:53.98]This tab goes in there.
[31:55.60]A split personality.
[31:58.68]Yeah, I'm like a guy and a son.
[32:09.71]Just like that.
[32:10.21]Bingo.
[32:11.73]Cool.
[32:14.01]Jerma Defoe.
[32:15.66]How do I read chat?
[32:18.02]Like this.
[32:18.36]The fuck?
[32:25.63]What did I say?
[32:26.41]Alright, that's done.
[32:32.29]Did I get that one too?
[32:33.63]I got them both, right?
[32:34.99]Yeah.
[32:36.25]That folds in and then it goes, the tab sticks in there.
[32:40.61]Which one of, which is the, who's the vegan?
[32:42.68]We're both vegan.
[32:44.97]Hey, Dad, can you make me some dinner?
[32:46.50]Yeah, sure thing, son.
[32:48.52]You want a veggie Ster fry?
[32:50.90]Yeah, that sounds delicious.
[32:52.50]Okay, I'll get right on that.
[33:03.81]Wholesome.
[33:06.43]Oh, he's so wholesome.
[33:11.55]Alright, remove these five pieces from A and B.
[33:14.89]You guys thought there was gonna be a joke there.
[33:16.23]No, I just asked dad to make me a Ster fry.
[33:21.90]What that kid doesn't know is I'm gonna mix in a bunch of fucking shredded chicken.
[33:32.37]Alright, let's go.
[33:34.03]That's so wholesome, huh?
[33:36.75]Alright, we need this piece.
[33:38.55]We need the Star Trek Voyager.
[33:55.55]This piece of cardboard does feel like the best show for some reason.
[33:59.03]I don't know why.
[33:59.51]I can feel it on here.
[34:04.06]I needed something else from there.
[34:10.26]Okay, then this comes out too.
[34:13.74]All of it does.
[34:24.68]Eat it, it'll taste like gingerbread.
[34:27.78]Don't tell me to do that.
[34:28.58]I have this weird personality issue where if somebody says the same thing for me to do, more than, nevermind.
[34:39.04]This one's empty, as you can see.
[34:52.04]Recycle.
[34:53.44]Recycle.
[34:54.32]Don't throw those in the trash, please.
[34:55.86]Nintendo, what have you done?
[34:58.14]At least have a program where you can send it back.
[35:02.95]I need this from B. I love you, Dad.
[35:09.01]I love you, son.
[35:09.49]Alright.
[35:12.27]No, no, not this one.
[35:17.55]no reason you just like you're in there playing video games and you just yell out to your dad's like up there and you just like hey I love you dad it's like alright yeah you too man it's a lot in here we're going strong
[35:48.21]Why do I look all sweaty?
[35:49.79]You guys have to understand this.
[35:51.71]I keep telling everybody this and everybody, it keeps coming back to me.
[35:54.61]You know what I'm saying?
[35:56.71]Everybody, that's the equivalent of blowing up a balloon animal.
[36:00.68]Okay, I'm not doing that again.
[36:03.16]You guys aren't four.
[36:04.22]That's not cool.
[36:05.78]That's cool to like a three-year-old.
[36:07.66]That's not cool.
[36:09.24]Do you guys think that that might be, if you were a child, you would be like, yeah.
[36:15.89]A lot of like a fucking kid's birthday party.
[36:20.55]Alright, let's go.
[36:24.91]Where are my keys?
[36:26.53]I need this piece, left part of the visor.
[36:35.60]I'm pulling out tricks from like the fucking clown school, magician show, hire the guy, jokey TV show, clown, book, manual.
[36:50.08]Whatever.
[37:01.69]This is why I can't be on camera.
[37:05.03]You guys, what I tell you, I can't be on camera.
[37:08.15]I'm too much of a fucking weirdo.
[37:09.45]Alright, fold this like that.
[37:13.20]Let's get a nice crease on it.
[37:16.76]There we go.
[37:22.97]Caught on camera.
[37:25.21]Yeah.
[37:27.17]What?
[37:27.49]Caught on camera doing what?
[37:28.99]I haven't done anything.
[37:34.56]I haven't done anything.
[37:44.02]Damn it.
[37:44.54]I can't do it.
[37:46.44]Maybe I can.
[37:47.38]Later.
[37:48.66]Just hold that thought.
[37:49.34]Just remember to hold that thought.
[37:56.87]Never mind.
[37:59.18]The stream is nice.
[38:02.64]You think that?
[38:03.14]Really?
[38:03.52]You think so?
[38:04.96]Thanks, man.
[38:07.32]Thank you.
[38:12.75]Yeah.
[38:12.91]Alright.
[38:14.55]Now let's fold that.
[38:17.97]I grabbed that piece, which is the one I just had, this one.
[38:28.94]There's water rings on the table.
[38:30.18]This thing's going in the trash.
[38:31.32]I don't care.
[38:33.54]You think, oh, yeah, he's lying.
[38:34.66]It's not going in the trash.
[38:35.34]I will karate chop through this by the end of the stream.
[38:38.48]You think that's a lie?
[38:39.86]I will, with my forearm, fucking go straight clean break through the middle of this table at the end of the stream.
[38:52.41]Shit.
[38:56.77]Okay.
[39:03.66]Don't attempt that.
[39:04.28]Guys, when I was like 14, I was sprinting with a bag like this.
[39:10.97]I was carrying a big heavy fucking potato sack over my head.
[39:13.89]And I was running really fast delivering it to somebody's house.
[39:15.99]And I ran into a fucking pole and shattered both of my forearms here.
[39:21.04]And then they had to put like two huge metal fucking Iron Man plates in here.
[39:25.64]So of course I would never attempt that if I wasn't a goddamn superhuman.
[39:44.22]All of a sudden, they're very quiet.
[39:48.40]I had nothing else to say.
[39:49.34]That's all I had to say.
[39:51.60]Okay, so this comes over here.
[39:57.24]It sits right... I want you guys to see this because it just perfectly matches up.
[40:00.49]It's so satisfying to look at.
[40:03.73]See how that goes right here?
[40:05.55]You can see right through that.
[40:07.85]Something about that, man.
[40:08.77]Okay, then that
[40:14.46]now comes over here sticks through the second hole all the way through about the rage quit okay it's in and that folds all the way around and sticks in here
[40:53.87]Very good.
[41:02.06]Right, okay.
[41:03.14]My brain just couldn't handle that.
[41:04.76]Alright, now.
[41:05.90]This long, complicated looking piece.
[41:07.48]This one here.
[41:09.00]This one.
[41:10.80]I've got to punch out all this bullshit.
[41:16.75]Rage quit the table in half.
[41:24.09]You know, actually, on second thought, I don't know if I'm going to do that.
[41:27.83]That might scare some of the grandkids watching.
[41:30.78]And I want them to have a respectful image of their great-great-great-grandfather.
[41:34.78]Not like my great-great-grandfather used to break shit.
[41:36.98]I don't know if I respect him anymore.
[41:39.56]How the fuck is he going to get my money?
[41:42.29]Better respect me.
[41:49.45]It's a little late for that.
[41:55.94]Grandpa used to break cardboard.
[42:01.80]That's fine.
[42:03.54]Grandpa used to do a lot of other cool shit, too.
[42:11.94]I like punching these little things out.
[42:13.12]It's therapeutic.
[42:15.08]Still in Anor Londo.
[42:28.97]I'm so sick of that fucking joke.
[42:40.58]Fold it in half.
[42:41.92]Hold on, I gotta fold it in half, just like that, and then we gotta get the grommet.
[42:48.54]I'm struggling with the toy.
[42:49.74]No, I'm not.
[42:52.10]Hey!
[42:53.38]Where's the bag?
[42:54.29]Where's the bag?
[42:55.85]Where's the bag?
[43:01.31]Who is the bag?
[43:03.31]Desk, desk, desk, desk.
[43:05.07]Which part of the desk?
[43:05.81]I don't know.
[43:07.57]Right there.
[43:08.39]Oh, thank you so much, guys.
[43:10.75]What would I do to help you?
[43:14.99]Thank you for helping me.
[43:16.15]I knew it was there.
[43:16.71]Alright, I'm now going to put the bag of grommets next to the mouse.
[43:26.42]Don't forget that, please.
[43:29.10]So that goes through here.
[43:30.14]We're making the left part of the visor.
[43:32.77]Visor.
[43:34.45]This is an estimated four-hour project, and we're already a fucking hour in, and I haven't even finished the visor.
[43:41.09]I'm taking two.
[43:45.37]I'm just like, whatever.
[43:46.77]We're just nonchalantly playing through this.
[43:50.27]I feel like helping.
[43:52.22]Get over here!
[43:53.04]Man!
[43:54.64]There we go.
[43:58.89]Don't come over though.
[44:02.93]That part now sticks onto here, right through it, like this.
[44:07.82]That doesn't feel very secure, but you know, it is Nintendo.
[44:14.66]Everything they do is secure.
[44:15.84]This.
[44:25.42]It's a little it's a little on the maybe side it's a little on the I don't know about this side I think I got a defect I got a fucking defect guys Yeah, it's a defect thanks for the defect I
[44:56.49]I got it.
[45:05.33]Alright.
[45:06.47]Then the grommet goes on, as we've seen a thousand times before.
[45:11.00]Fold that up.
[45:11.78]Fold this piece up.
[45:15.36]And then the grommet goes on top.
[45:18.76]Make sure to line the eyelet up with the very center of the hole in the top piece.
[45:22.03]The two L's should be right next to each other.
[45:27.44]What do you think I am, stupid?
[45:34.13]I got it.
[45:34.75]I'm fine.
[45:35.33]I did it perfectly fine.
[45:45.12]Stick this on like that.
[46:21.21]I got it.
[46:22.55]It was just hard to get in there.
[46:23.55]This one's thick.
[46:25.25]Thick.
[46:25.78]Got it.
[46:34.02]The left side of the visor is done.
[46:35.08]That connects to over here.
[46:36.16]Next, we're going to make the Joy-Con holder.
[46:37.74]This is a very important part.
[46:39.20]Stay focused.
[46:39.96]What the fuck do you want me to do with this thing?
[46:45.65]Rip it?
[46:46.45]Throw it?
[46:48.67]Run from it?
[46:51.66]It's going in there all the same.
[46:54.74]Okay.
[47:05.53]Twist it.
[47:07.73]How's the music?
[47:08.23]Is the music loud enough for you guys?
[47:09.73]Should I blast it?
[47:13.53]It looks fairly low.
[47:14.29]Alright.
[47:20.87]Tilt, tilt, tilt, tilt, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[47:24.49]Everything, everything, everything.

[47:28.47]B, A, B, A, B, A, start.
[47:36.92]You know the KonamiCon was created to help program humans, part of a government experiment?
[47:44.89]And it worked.

[48:55.88]Not louder.
[48:58.12]Use a coaster.
[48:59.22]No.
[49:01.68]Shit.
[49:02.60]You think I fucking want to use a coaster?
[49:05.74]You think I care about this table?
[49:20.78]The answer is I do.
[49:21.92]Very much so.
[49:23.18]This was dispensive.
[49:27.92]Vree.
[49:28.32]Where's the music?
[49:29.30]Don't fucking Vree.
[49:31.14]Alright, hold on.
[49:32.10]I gotta get a refill.
[49:32.92]If I spill one drop, the stream ends.
[49:55.71]No drops!
[50:12.99]This guy's crazy.
[50:15.53]Oh, I'm a disciplined emotional.
[50:21.91]Not one drop.
[50:22.69]Look at that.
[50:23.15]Not a fucking drop.
[50:24.07]And you didn't even see it because I was blocking it.
[50:31.39]What is wrong with this dude?
[50:35.31]What do you mean?
[50:36.27]I'm just having, whatever.
[50:37.79]Let's go.
[50:38.21]Let's build the lab up.
[50:39.61]Alright.
[50:42.19]My biggest fear was always that people would come into the stream and like think that I was actually a sicko.
[50:50.63]Half a shot, whoa, take it easy, dude.
[50:56.09]One day you'll be the one guy.
[51:01.06]One day you're gonna be the one guy, that's all I say.
[51:11.41]Now it's gonna taste bad.
[51:12.27]It doesn't matter how it tastes.
[51:13.29]That was really like, that doesn't sound good.
[51:20.81]Alright, we're going to flip this around.
[51:21.97]This goes on.
[51:22.49]Oh, this is going to be cool.
[51:23.23]I can't wait for this shit.
[51:25.35]So this goes on this side.
[51:30.74]Oh, look at this.
[51:33.88]This is going to be so cool.
[51:35.92]So then this device goes this way, right on top.
[51:44.00]Haha, foolish Joy-Con holder, you fell right into my cunning trap.
[51:46.80]I'm going to hold you here with these two tabs, one side on either side.
[51:51.33]You would have laughed at that if you were 11.
[51:54.07]Er, sorry, I dream of super villainry.
[51:56.09]Insert the tabs into the slots on the left and right.
[51:57.98]You can laugh evilly or not.
[51:59.30]Your call.
[52:00.42]I ain't gonna do that.
[52:00.98]I can guarantee you.
[52:04.63]Line that up.
[52:24.74]I'm seeing a whole lot of do it's in the chat here.
[52:26.52]That felt good to do.
[52:39.95]Just hold on a second.
[52:47.01]No, I'm going to break the stream if I do this.
[52:54.63]I don't even have the... Why am I going to do it like this?
[53:10.86]Like, why do I care about that?
[53:14.42]I leaked my passcode.
[53:15.52]This passcode is fucking meaningless.
[53:18.00]You think I give a shit?
[53:20.60]Everybody's iPhone password is like fucking 4111.
[53:24.64]Like 1112.
[53:25.67]That's not important to me.
[53:28.21]Oh no!
[53:29.27]They got it!
[53:30.47]You got my phone!
[53:32.45]Don't open my... You have it physically!
[53:34.54]Oh shit!
[53:37.10]4111!
[53:37.12]No!
[53:37.22]You got into my phone!
[53:38.10]You're not here!
[53:54.34]Get out of here.
[53:55.78]Get out of here.
[54:03.93]Get out of here.
[54:04.89]Hold on.
[54:05.17]Is there like a voice changer on here?
[54:12.39]Where is it?
[54:20.12]Where the fuck is it?
[54:21.22]I have it.
[54:22.00]I own this stupid thing.
[54:24.73]God I don't care.
[54:25.57]There's your evil left.
[54:28.31]Let's please move on Don't even What he's a woodpecker He's an evil fucking bastard

[54:56.13]And his password.
[54:56.65]His iPhone password.
[54:57.89]Oh, no.
[54:58.63]Look at my iPhone password.
[54:59.59]What am I going to do?
[55:08.02]You got stains on my table.
[55:09.48]I'm not going to resell it.
[55:10.80]I'm going to throw this in the air and shoot it with a shotgun.
[55:14.64]You know, I'm just going to like call.
[55:17.00]Boom.
[55:19.42]With protective gear and done in a safe environment.
[55:28.76]It's pull, not call.
[55:36.90]Whatever.
[55:37.08]Alright, so this is going in.
[55:39.19]What is call then?
[55:42.07]Alright, that sticks in like this.
[55:47.09]Oh, that fails.
[55:49.01]Oh, look at that one.
[55:51.72]This is coming along, huh?
[55:53.16]Four-hour project.
[55:54.48]Eight hours.
[55:56.34]Tab sticks in.
[56:02.62]So, bingo.
[56:09.37]It's from poker.
[56:12.09]Whatever.
[56:13.65]As you can tell, I'm a fucking good poker player.
[56:15.39]I almost just broke it.
[56:25.30]Get in there.
[56:26.72]Got it.
[56:27.16]Okay.
[56:28.60]It is done.
[56:28.98]The visor is now complete.
[56:32.99]At least this part of it.
[56:36.29]Money down the drain.
[56:37.07]What do you mean money down the drain?
[56:41.46]Like poker?
[56:42.78]I don't play poker.
[56:45.80]I'm going to get like sharked if I play poker.
[56:47.70]Okay, hold on.
[56:49.96]There's more.
[56:51.70]It's time to put the finishing touches on the visor.
[56:53.67]Let's attach a strap so you can actually wear it.
[56:58.75]Take the flat strap from the bag.
[57:02.68]You don't want the long one or the short one.
[57:04.38]It's the medium length one.
[57:05.60]Okay, it's the Goldilocks one.
[57:12.10]So not too big, not too small.
[57:13.54]The one that's just right.
[57:17.56]Okay, so.
[57:21.57]This one.
[57:24.47]This one is short.
[57:27.32]This one is long, so it's not.
[57:30.48]Hold on, let's do a good comparison here.
[57:37.31]One, this one's short.
[57:39.99]This one looks pretty medium to me.
[57:41.89]Oh wait, oh fuck, hold on, this is two pieces.
[57:44.13]So it's this one.
[57:49.84]Got it, okay.
[57:55.04]Don't let me forget about those.
[57:58.94]Nothing's in here now.
[58:01.90]Whatever.
[58:02.12]Alright.
[58:06.10]I got the strap.
[58:09.13]Don't forget about those.
[58:10.17]I just remember where they are.
[58:11.03]Okay.
[58:11.65]Let's start threading the strap through from the Joy-Con holder side.
[58:14.85]Just watch and try to copy it.
[58:16.07]Alright.
[58:24.16]So like this.
[58:27.28]This goes... Where's L?
[58:28.38]L.
[58:29.76]Go back.
[58:31.02]So we got L, side L here.
[58:36.56]Like this.
[58:41.14]So this goes through here.
[58:45.03]So then they're gonna flip it around on you.
[58:47.77]Okay, so as you pass the strap through the holes on this side of the visor, keep the pointy side up.
[58:55.84]Pass the strap through the holes in both layers of the cardboard.
[58:58.42]Flip, flip.
[59:02.30]Alright, so we're going through here.
[59:08.77]One.
[59:11.63]And then through this one.
[59:17.48]Like that.
[59:19.52]This is going on my head?
[59:23.34]Let's go.
[59:23.76]Whip, whip.
[59:25.19]Whip, whip.
[59:25.75]I made this.
[59:29.80]Pull your finger into the little rounded cutout and open the hidden pocket.
[59:34.45]Hidden pocket, reveal your secrets.
[59:40.25]What the fuck are you talking about?
[59:41.95]Pull this.
[59:50.72]You guys can't even fucking see it.
[59:52.92]Okay, so this has to come in a little more.
[59:58.45]I didn't break it, that's fine.
[60:01.46]Alright, so that's open now.
[60:03.06]What was that for?
[60:04.62]Hidden pocket.
[60:08.22]Oh my, what's this?
[60:09.00]There's a hole hidden in the back of the pocket.
[60:11.28]No way!
[60:12.93]Strap through there.
[60:13.71]What the fuck?
[60:22.33]Oh shit.
[60:25.17]Is this shit gonna fit in there?
[60:28.19]Ooh!
[60:29.11]Okay, this goes in there now.
[60:31.15]And then out through the hidden pocket.
[60:37.46]If you can get the length just right, the pointy end of the strip should fit in the pocket perfectly.
[60:41.44]Oh, it looks so cozy.
[60:44.02]And then you close it up.
[60:46.98]Alright.
[60:52.01]Fuck, this doesn't feel very good.
[60:55.39]So this goes in here.
[60:57.89]Slip it in there.
[61:06.08]Is it too far in?
[61:06.86]That looks a little too far in.
[61:12.32]Maybe by a little bit?
[61:14.98]Just imagine how much cardboard packages you've wasted.
[61:19.53]I don't think so.
[61:21.15]This has to be tight though.
[61:22.25]That's not very taut.
[61:26.86]Now it is.
[61:27.90]Alright, it's in there.
[61:28.74]It ain't going anywhere.
[61:32.04]Pull it out a little bit.
[61:37.81]Yeah, you find me a fucking nine-year-old that can do this.
[61:40.09]No way.
[61:40.41]Alright, that looks good, right?
[61:43.63]Chat?
[61:45.43]What do you think, chat?
[61:46.33]Chat?
[61:49.78]So then that closes up.
[61:51.96]Hidden pocket is now good.
[61:55.96]Do the same thing on the other side.
[61:56.91]Try pulling the strap to tighten it.
[61:58.09]That's pretty tight.
[62:06.59]Same thing on the other side.
[62:09.21]Now let's thread it through the other side, you dingo.
[62:12.58]Okay, down through this little wavy part, out.
[62:20.90]Wait, yeah, okay.
[62:25.39]Through the middle.
[62:26.79]Where's the hidden pocket on this side?
[62:31.69]Right?
[62:32.43]There's no hidden pocket here.
[62:35.41]Okay.
[62:36.51]No.
[62:38.17]Then go straight on to the neighbor hole.
[62:41.73]Pull on the strap to take up the slack.
[62:44.85]Okay, so let's take the whole thing.
[62:48.68]Look, it's this easy!
[62:56.43]Is this gonna fit on my head?
[62:57.41]Okay, so now the... This is about how long the strap that goes across your forehead should be.
[63:04.92]If yours looks like this, you're good in good shape.
[63:09.44]Mine doesn't look like that.
[63:10.84]It needs to be tighter.
[63:14.68]Like that.
[63:16.97]That's better, right?
[63:23.95]Did I do too much?
[63:25.55]That looks good.
[63:28.62]Alright, sweet.
[63:33.42]Now this probably goes around.
[63:35.28]The rest of the strap will now go through one of the zigzaggy openings on the left hand part.
[63:38.89]It should be the same one shown on screen.
[63:40.59]Okay, that one.
[63:45.01]Through there and then around to the, okay.
[63:55.82]This way.
[63:59.21]They make this so difficult.
[64:03.55]That's in.
[64:06.89]Finally tighten the strap by pulling on it.
[64:08.37]Now that's what it's supposed to look like.
[64:12.72]Mine doesn't really look like that.
[64:14.36]It's a little loose.
[64:19.46]Now stop and check that everything looks fine.
[64:20.94]Does the strap go all the way around without getting twisted?
[64:30.66]What about right here?
[64:31.52]I don't think that matters.
[64:35.64]I can always tighten it.
[64:37.26]Tighten it a little bit.
[64:40.33]Wrong way.
[64:40.81]It's not the wrong way.
[64:43.27]How is it the wrong way?
[64:44.59]Wrong hole.
[64:47.13]What are you talking about?
[64:47.79]This is the right hole.
[64:51.37]Test it on your head.
[64:52.05]I don't even know how this goes.
[64:53.18]What do you mean test it on your head?
[64:54.44]I don't know how this goes on.
[65:00.02]I don't know how this goes on.
[65:12.65]It goes on your head, but how?
[65:19.97]Honestly, I don't know how this works.
[65:21.85]This is supposed to be a visor.
[65:23.95]Like it's supposed to go like this.
[65:43.93]Okay, now the strap, strap, strap, strap.
[65:45.85]Okay, we got the first part done.
[65:47.21]Visor's done.
[65:47.81]I'm ready to be a robot.
[65:50.69]This guy's so sweaty.
[65:53.45]I'm bringing down a thing to fucking mop up my face.
[65:58.02]Don't touch your fucking face with your gross hands.
[66:00.80]Watch out.
[66:01.16]And we're back.
[66:15.52]Okay, so that's good.
[66:20.37]You saw what?
[66:21.63]You didn't see shit.
[66:25.67]See, even Nintendo doesn't know how it goes on.
[66:28.31]I think it goes, I don't know, it might go on like this.
[66:29.91]I have no fucking idea.
[66:30.98]You figure it out.
[66:34.92]Put the visor on so that the Joy-Con holder goes on the left side of your face.
[66:41.76]Just like Headley is doing.
[66:50.67]It's too tight.
[66:51.87]I've got a bigger head than this.
[66:57.53]I've got to pull this out a lot.
[67:01.89]Remember, the tutorial on the screen was made for a four-year-old's head.
[67:06.07]Alright, so let's put it on like this.
[67:10.40]Okay.
[67:10.68]I feel like I'm trying to communicate with fucking aliens.
[67:16.50]Alright, so now...
[67:22.48]I don't understand.
[67:23.10]Adjust the length of the strap so it fits.
[67:25.68]Yes, this works, I think.
[67:28.45]I'm ready to do a double dare fucking family challenge.
[67:31.51]Quick, Uncle, throw the milk in my head!
[67:34.29]Quick, I gotta catch the eggs!
[67:46.48]Oh.
[67:48.76]Hold on a second.
[67:52.78]I didn't know it could do that.
[67:53.90]Hold on a second.
[68:00.62]They thought of everything.
[68:03.95]There we go.
[68:07.25]Activate the visor.
[68:45.18]Shut up.
[68:49.04]Hey, you did it.
[68:49.56]You finished the visor.
[68:50.82]Put it in a safe place.
[68:53.84]Okay, that's cool.
[68:55.56]You can't deny that that's cool.
[69:00.24]I mean, that's $80 cool.
[69:01.92]You know what I'm saying?
[69:06.70]Where's this going to go?
[69:08.90]This guy's 32.
[69:09.38]How old are you?
[69:11.73]Dude.
[69:14.94]I don't wanna break it though.
[69:15.68]The robot sees all, knows all.
[69:17.36]Alright, that's creepy.
[69:22.04]17.
[69:23.11]You got a lot to learn.
[69:25.75]You got a lot to learn.
[69:29.15]I wish you well.
[69:41.25]You will all learn.
[69:44.33]How smart, how, I'm smart enough not to buy this.
[69:50.41]I bought a, okay, does it make me stupid that I purchased a Switch for this to do these three streams?
[69:56.86]Is that like okay?
[69:58.90]That's okay, right?
[70:00.96]Because I mean, I own it now and now I can play B-O-T-W.
[70:03.86]You know, bring on the wild.
[70:12.15]Let's go, that was fun.
[70:19.92]Alright, so now it's time to move this shit out of the fucking way.
[70:24.60]Take one tiny sip of my half alcohol drink.
[70:31.45]That was step one.
[70:32.27]Yeah, we're gonna be here for a little while.
[70:33.45]Just relax.
[70:33.87]Alright, we need these four parts from sheets C and D.
[70:43.73]I'm just like bumping into shit.
[70:45.45]I just think, okay, I just tried to parallel park and I fucking hit the guy behind me and then I hit the guy in front of me.
[70:56.28]It's alright, you can see it.
[71:00.09]A, C, D, C, D.
[71:17.18]So we need all the pieces from here.
[71:19.16]All of them?
[71:20.60]Every single one?
[71:21.17]Alright, everybody be quiet so you can hear the pops.
[71:23.99]Alright, that's what you're here for.
[71:26.01]Don't tell me you're here for any other reason.
[71:27.71]You're here for the pop.
[71:48.67]Sorry for the pops, ladies and gentlemen.
[71:57.99]And this thing can go away.
[71:58.81]It doesn't know where the piece is, right?
[71:59.82]Yeah!
[72:02.18]Oh, what the fuck?
[72:11.12]Go, team, go!
[72:12.99]That's right!
[72:14.15]The Florida Gators are gonna win the fucking championship this year!
[72:25.19]You laughed at that.
[72:25.81]Don't tell me you didn't.
[72:26.45]Bullshit.
[72:37.89]I laughed out of pain.
[72:39.79]You still did.
[72:40.47]That's a win for me.
[72:45.25]Humans only have two hands.
[72:46.43]I can't do this with four.
[72:56.20]It wasn't funny.
[73:00.53]Sorry.
[73:01.97]That's it.
[73:03.35]Put it in the recycle pile.
[73:05.17]This one is also done, right?
[73:06.77]Put it in the recycle pile.
[73:08.01]Alright, let's go.
[73:14.33]What do you mean?
[73:21.28]Shut up.
[73:25.61]You can start with any of the four pieces.
[73:26.93]It doesn't matter.
[73:27.59]Time for the garbage bag.
[73:31.27]No, I gave up.
[73:32.35]I gave up.
[73:32.75]I don't care.
[73:35.17]You know what I mean?
[73:37.47]Like, I gave the fuck up.
[73:42.78]You can't win, right?
[73:43.58]You can't win.
[73:44.34]So you might as well just accept it.
[73:48.98]Any of the four pieces.
[73:52.22]So these are gonna get in the way.
[73:53.44]Let's stack them.
[74:02.56]I don't know why I did that.
[74:03.70]I had to.
[74:04.02]Okay.
[74:07.84]Getting harassed?
[74:11.07]No, it's alright.
[74:13.17]Don't worry about it.
[74:18.53]So I wonder how much fun the actual game will be.
[74:20.83]Do you think it'll be fun?
[74:24.45]I hope so.
[74:27.50]I don't know if somebody already asked you, but I missed it.
[74:30.02]The chat went too fast.
[74:30.84]I'm sorry.
[74:38.27]I mean, it's a bit longer at least.
[74:42.13]I'm having trouble getting this out.
[74:46.25]I think you'll play it for 10 minutes and move on.
[74:47.87]Well, there's nothing else to move on to.
[74:49.64]There's only the build the robot thing in this.
[74:51.90]But by the way, what is up with that shit?
[74:54.12]Can we talk about that for a second?
[74:56.34]So the variety kit is about 12 hours of stuff and it's $70.
[75:00.66]The robot kit is $80 and four hours of content.
[75:08.65]What's the logic there?
[75:13.07]How does that make any sense?
[75:15.01]That's the problem I have with the Labo is you got this variety kit with all this cool shit.
[75:19.09]Thing is 70 bucks and it lasts like 12 hours.
[75:25.12]Just fold everything.
[75:28.96]Probably gonna have to do this to all of them, so.
[75:36.04]They're selling you cardboard.
[75:37.12]Well, I mean, yeah, I already lost.
[75:39.44]I know that, right?
[75:40.96]Like, I'm well aware that I've already lost.
[75:44.06]But if I'm already going to lose, why would you kick me while I'm down?
[75:47.82]Not you guys.
[75:48.30]I'm talking about Nintendo.
[75:49.60]I bought the variety kit.
[75:50.52]I bought all of it.
[75:54.54]It's complexity.
[75:55.74]Is this one really more complex than the piano was?
[75:58.40]I don't think so.
[76:01.47]Not yet at least, we'll see.
[76:02.89]I will hold my judgements until the end of the stream, which will probably be in about nine hours.
[76:09.67]At the rate that we're going.
[76:12.25]Okay.
[76:18.06]That one felt pretty good.
[76:18.90]One more here.
[76:24.92]The strings are where it gets difficult.
[76:27.06]Well, I'll already be half of the bag at that point, so that'll be fun.
[76:34.92]Alright, this is all folded up, so now it looks like it comes across.
[76:37.80]I'll get it so I can just do them all real quick.
[76:41.06]So then this just folds over, and the tab goes in there.
[76:46.02]Okay, so this just comes across like this, which then in turn the tab comes up.
[76:56.08]Like this.
[76:58.72]I'll just do them all real quick.
[76:59.98]Probably all four of them have to be done.
[77:03.31]And then in, in, up.
[77:05.33]Okay, so in, in, up.
[77:10.59]This goes in here.
[77:12.41]Tab goes down.
[77:13.11]So we're probably gonna have to do this like three times.
[77:16.90]What am I making right now?
[77:19.46]I don't even know what this is.
[77:23.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[77:24.26]Okay, the first power piston is complete.
[77:28.50]Three more power pistons keep the momentum going.
[77:30.44]All the pistons will be exactly the same.
[77:31.94]So there's no difference at all.
[77:34.01]Here's a pro tip, you can fast, I know how to do this, Nintendo.
[77:37.53]Please, don't treat me like an idiot.
[77:38.95]Alright, let's do them all.
[77:41.47]Let's do four of these.
[77:42.91]I know how to do it.
[77:43.53]Let's just power through this.
[77:48.43]Somebody jupe, jupe-puked?
[77:50.47]Somebody jupe-puked?
[77:53.07]I want his name.
[77:53.59]Alright, how fast can I do this, do you think?
[77:58.15]Start the timer in one, it's 1-18-45.
[78:02.99]stream time so let's see how long it takes me to do these four ready ready okay here we go start counting don't count in the chat but count on your head ready one two three go
[78:38.86]I'm never gonna learn.
[78:44.87]I will never learn.
[79:01.10]Didn't get that one.
[79:01.84]In.
[79:08.98]In.
[79:10.28]Up and out.
[79:20.61]Done.
[79:21.77]Piston two.
[79:22.45]Done.
[79:23.50]Stack them.
[79:25.54]Again.
[79:26.34]Start counting now.
[79:28.90]In your head.
[79:41.54]Second.
[80:49.43]This used to be a counting.
[80:52.87]No, it wasn't.
[80:53.41]Never was.
[81:04.40]Done.
[81:05.98]Strike it.
[81:17.21]We have the baby.
[81:17.91]What do you mean baby was in bed?
[81:19.41]What are you talking about?
[81:23.74]What are you saying?
[81:25.24]What happened?
[81:25.60]I don't have a baby.
[81:31.14]Where's the baby that you're talking about?
[81:35.24]I'm an assembly line worker.
[81:39.79]Yes.
[81:40.93]For today.
[81:41.71]Just for today.
[81:47.09]These ones are kind of boring.
[81:49.91]The pistons aren't fun.
[81:51.39]They're boring.
[81:51.87]$80 pistons.
[81:55.36]Okay, tap that.
[81:59.78]Fold it in.
[82:00.46]We're almost done.
[82:01.38]The boring part is almost done.
[82:03.02]We can get back to the fun shit.
[82:06.17]We probably won't, but you know.
[82:08.09]I told you I was going to do these streams.
[82:12.23]Right?
[82:12.65]I told you this was going to happen.
[82:17.07]Stream's almost over.
[82:17.87]Not even close.
[82:19.49]Like, actually not even close.
[82:22.45]The stream is probably about 8% of the way done.
[82:27.21]Maybe a little bit less.
[82:30.03]We got a long way.
[82:30.97]I hope you guys are drinking.
[82:41.23]If you're of the current age that is allowed to be drinking.
[82:43.21]What happened?
[82:43.89]Oh my god, I haven't done anything in so long the game's going to turn off.
[82:47.33]Alright, got all four pistons done, stacked up.
[82:54.46]We can just drink and watch.
[82:55.56]If you're of legal drinking age, then have one.
[82:58.02]Maybe one.
[82:58.48]Have one.
[83:01.32]Don't have more than one, I'll know.
[83:02.23]I can see the way you guys are typing.
[83:04.27]You guys are slurring your turds.
[83:05.43]Your typing words.
[83:06.91]Here we go.
[83:18.95]I'm not going to have to do stickers and shit, too.
[83:20.92]I hate this already.
[83:22.60]I already don't like this.
[83:25.88]How long is it?
[83:26.28]Five minutes?
[83:26.68]Done.
[83:28.70]Easy.
[83:28.96]Okay, another one.
[83:33.73]Look, we can skip half this shit.
[83:34.99]This looks nice over here, doesn't it?
[83:36.19]Wouldn't it be bad if I just dropped a match right there?
[83:42.95]I just actually looked for one.
[83:44.15]What am I doing?
[83:49.43]You look nice.
[83:50.05]Thanks.
[83:53.77]Thank you.
[83:54.05]Alright.
[83:55.17]Now time to get some marker stickers out of the bag.
[83:57.11]The robot won't be able to move without them.
[83:58.74]Good.
[83:59.20]Can't wait.
[84:00.42]Can't wait.
[84:04.46]This is the worst part of any of the labos is putting the stickers on.
[84:08.42]This is the worst thing to do here.
[84:13.66]Nothing about what I'm about to do is fun.
[84:15.98]I wish they would have just deleted it from the video game.
[84:18.26]Okay, so we got to do this four times.
[84:20.54]You need four big stickers.
[84:22.04]Check it out.
[84:22.58]Yeah, let's make an assembly line.
[84:24.90]Let's make it efficient.
[84:26.32]One, two, three, four.
[84:30.23]Get the joy out of the way.
[84:32.05]No joy here right now.
[84:34.37]One, two, three, four.
[84:36.31]Four big stickers.
[84:37.93]There's one, two, three, four here.
[84:40.99]So they go right in the middle.
[84:43.68]Check the stickers on the screen, carefully be sure you're using the right ones.
[84:46.02]Yep, it's the four big ones, I can see them.
[84:49.06]Right, follow the little dotted lines and try to stick the stickers on nice and straight, a tiny bit crooked is fine.
[84:56.03]So this goes right across from the tab.
[85:00.79]One, two, three, four, you got it.
[85:09.49]Only a tiny bit, what do you mean?
[85:13.26]Okay, let's get this right.
[85:16.53]Tell me if I get it wrong.
[85:17.31]I don't want you to be honest.
[85:23.17]Alright, I got it wrong.
[85:25.11]He said it could be off.
[85:28.31]I don't care.
[85:28.69]That's right.
[85:35.32]Next one right down the middle here.
[85:39.36]Robot build.
[85:48.74]That one is so perfect, it's almost criminal how fucking good that one is.
[85:54.06]That's almost against the law, I did that so well.
[86:00.19]Like people are gonna find out, like the FBI is gonna be like, how did he do that so perfectly?
[86:04.29]There's no way, there's no spider there, I'm fine.
[86:14.56]So what the fuck are these for?
[86:16.42]Pistons?
[86:19.06]Pistons.
[86:22.00]Oh!
[86:23.44]Bro, I ripped it!
[86:24.46]Oh, bro, I ripped it!
[86:28.75]Bro!
[86:29.89]What?
[86:30.19]I just said, like, four different languages.
[86:32.97]Oh, bro, I ripped it!
[86:33.97]It's okay.
[86:41.26]I'm going too fast.
[86:42.44]I gotta slow down.
[86:43.84]The speed is not necessary right here.
[86:46.58]Finesse is.
[86:51.00]Like that.
[86:53.29]Get him on the line because he's got superhuman intelligence.
[86:56.07]Okay.
[87:06.57]Get four power sheets ready.
[87:08.66]They should be tucked inside sheet J. What?
[87:18.30]Four power sheets?
[87:19.34]What the fuck is that?
[87:24.51]Four power sheets?
[87:32.50]Okay.
[87:32.76]What on Earth, one, two, what the fuck are these?
[87:39.36]I don't have enough space for this.
[87:44.34]Get one, two, four power sheets ready.
[87:48.38]These are huge, I can't do this.
[87:51.26]What are these for?
[87:57.63]Separate the strips starting at the little triangle bite marks.
[88:00.94]Don't tear the other thinner horizontal perforated lines.
[88:03.74]Okay, we're going to take off strips of gum.
[88:11.24]So split all of this.
[88:23.10]Don't?
[88:23.50]What do you mean don't?
[88:24.20]Hold on.
[88:27.77]I need this space here.
[88:30.09]Stack them.
[88:36.93]I don't know where to put these.
[88:40.59]Don't say I'm going to ruin it.
[88:41.63]This one's hard.
[88:44.53]Are there any wetness here?
[88:46.03]There's fucking wetness.
[88:50.95]There's too much wetness.
[88:51.77]I have to take care of this.
[88:52.55]Wait.
[88:54.79]Oh, don't fall.
[88:56.30]Stay there.
[88:56.72]Don't fall.
[89:03.53]So I need to, so much wetness.
[89:05.49]Hold on a second.
[89:19.70]Okay.
[89:28.52]That should be enough.
[89:29.16]Perfect.
[89:38.77]Am I Spongebob?
[89:39.55]Why is it Spongebob?
[89:42.30]Oh, it's so bright.
[89:43.18]Okay, what do I do?
[89:44.88]Just take off the... I'm terrible at shit like this, guys.
[89:49.43]You should see me trying to take a check out of my checkbook.
[89:52.79]It's not good.
[89:55.11]I've ripped so many checks trying to do this.
[90:10.11]Slow.
[90:14.50]Fold it.
[90:39.81]That's wrong.
[90:41.55]Starts up here.
[90:51.50]Oh, that's nice.
[90:52.45]That's nice.
[90:53.67]I like that sound, don't you?
[91:21.66]I'm getting sick of it.
[91:22.54]He's getting sick of it.
[91:23.26]He's getting sick of it.
[91:24.14]No, no, no.
[91:24.76]Slow it down.
[91:25.26]He's getting sick of doing this.
[91:27.32]He's got four of these that he has to do.
[91:28.90]He's getting sick of it.
[91:30.29]He's having trouble.
[91:32.91]What if I just like...
[91:52.18]And one, two, three, separate.
[91:54.97]Oh, and he's so fucking good at what he does.
[91:57.33]Now what do I do?
[92:18.60]Oh, I need to know.
[92:20.80]Got to be in the know.
[92:21.48]Okay, now we're going to fold each one of these stride gums.
[92:33.44]But what's the top?
[92:34.78]Does it matter?
[92:35.26]I don't think it matters.
[92:45.06]You can't do it like that, liar.
[92:49.25]Return it.
[92:49.79]Return it.
[92:51.29]How does it start?
[92:54.37]Like this.
[93:14.19]Like that.
[93:29.10]fucking idiot no it told me to do it the wrong way it had to oh shit are there extra ones I can feel it trying to get out of I can feel it trying to rip
[94:07.07]Okay, that's okay.
[94:10.28]I'm not singing anything, I'm just being stressed.
[94:15.12]Do it to all of them.
[94:16.72]Fold it the way up until it's small.
[94:18.58]If it accidentally tears along the dotted line, you can just stack the pieces.
[94:22.86]Same for the second strip, remember your rhythm.
[94:24.42]Okay, so same thing, turn it this way and done.
[94:29.91]Little accordion.
[94:32.43]Over here, let's go.
[94:47.47]like it dumb streamer wrong way that's the correct way actually folks see that folks that's the correct way folks don't tell me it's wrong folks because it's not we've got two stacks I need to weigh these down all these things have condensation what about this it's got condensation on the bottom
[95:16.43]I'm going to stain.
[95:17.75]It's wet, all of the bottom here.
[95:27.40]There we go.
[95:28.04]Same thing with the other ones.
[95:32.24]Yeah, just show them.
[95:33.36]Do it all.
[95:33.82]All of them.
[95:41.47]Okay.
[95:42.75]All of them.
[95:52.10]I don't want that to end.
[95:52.96]I want to be able to hear that forever.
[96:30.98]I figured out the correct way.
[96:33.18]New emote?
[96:33.74]What do you mean new emotes?
[96:34.94]No new emotes ever.
[96:37.12]Alright, I got them stacked.
[96:40.37]Now, before we can insert the stacks into the power piston, we need to fold back this little, wait.
[97:07.83]Okay, yeah, I'm fine, let's go.
[97:09.73]So fold this back.
[97:14.97]So it hits the little thing there.
[97:16.61]Okay.
[97:19.97]Fold it back, ding.
[97:26.95]Peek-a-boo!
[97:28.69]Can you see in there?
[97:31.65]Before we can insert the stack so that we can probably fold the bag, the long tab looks a little bit like a tongue.
[97:38.70]Okay, so that's folded back.
[97:39.86]Once that's done, we'll slide in the first stack.
[97:44.58]So this goes in there like this.
[97:47.86]With a little piece of gray.
[97:49.91]This way.
[97:53.91]Slide it in.
[97:57.55]Wait, what the fuck?
[97:58.51]We have to do them all?
[98:23.08]Look at this, it's like an accordion.
[98:24.20]It's not gonna happen.
[98:25.46]They all have to go in the same way too.
[98:27.12]Did I go wrong?
[98:28.22]No, gray on the top right.
[98:36.02]One.
[98:39.58]Two.
[98:41.88]This ain't gonna fucking happen.
[98:43.31]These things are so... Look at this, two in there.
[98:48.07]All of them have to go in here, every single one.
[98:50.80]The same way.
[98:51.90]Good fucking luck, guys.
[98:54.54]It's already full.
[98:59.23]Why is this not all the way in there?
[99:09.90]Why would they, why wouldn't they just make a big one?
[99:14.36]I have to do this four times.
[99:16.90]You understand?
[99:17.58]Four more times.
[99:22.35]There's so many of these.
[99:25.43]Get away, B. Holy shit.
[99:33.10]I can't get that in there.
[99:40.29]I can't get this in here.
[99:51.51]And just like that, he takes it away.
[100:04.36]This is heavy.
[100:05.00]You could hurt somebody with this thing.
[100:06.18]Alright, my cigarettes are all packed.
[100:09.62]Power piston suddenly feels a lot heavier.
[100:11.24]That weight puts the power in the power piston.
[100:14.42]Finally, double check to make sure that the long tongue-like tab is folded back properly.
[100:18.23]It is.
[100:25.92]I gotta do this.
[100:28.36]This one's done.
[100:30.71]Slide it over there.
[100:31.59]Fuck me, man.
[100:32.25]I gotta do this so many times.
[100:33.39]I gotta drink for this one.
[100:35.49]Hey, if you got him, smoke him, alright?
[100:38.91]Smoke him if you got him.
[100:44.18]One, two, three.
[100:48.08]You fucking idiot.
[100:48.82]Get that wetness.
[100:56.10]Get that wetness.
[100:57.56]That top coat.
[100:59.08]Pure vanilla.
[101:04.64]That cream.
[101:05.92]That top coat.
[101:09.25]That's a 10.
[101:09.69]Oh yeah.
[101:21.94]Dry the table off again.
[101:23.06]I don't need to.
[101:26.53]Hold on, let me just warm it up.
[101:33.70]What am I drinking?
[101:40.33]Just a little, just a little, just enough.
[101:42.23]You know, just a little.
[101:43.69]Tiny forearms.
[101:44.89]Are you serious?
[101:45.46]You think these are little?
[101:46.74]Let's take a look.
[101:57.07]And then the scroll of your deceit.
[102:04.25]All the taxes you owe the empire.
[102:06.67]Oh, yes, you little peasant.
[102:13.10]Here are all the taxes that you owe the empire.
[102:18.84]As you can see...
[102:27.62]It's blank, you don't know shit.
[102:30.36]Looks like you're up to date.
[102:32.28]Good work.
[102:37.19]I'm unsubbing, don't do it.
[102:43.47]You think I can pure vanilla this one?
[102:57.41]It's blank.
[103:02.85]These ones are ultra attached.
[103:08.82]So now that I know what's going on, I don't need to be careful with it.
[103:10.92]Just fucking rip it.
[103:11.80]And then it's this way.
[103:19.32]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[103:20.89]Hold on, wait.
[103:21.75]I need to see it again just to make sure I'm not a stupid idiot.
[103:31.72]Yeah, I got it.
[103:32.26]Okay.
[103:32.42]For the people that want to hear the sounds, everybody quiet.
[104:00.46]Wait, so...
[104:06.03]I did that last time.
[104:07.71]Last time we played Labo, everybody thought I really puked.
[104:09.67]I did.
[104:11.92]I did.
[104:13.04]I did.
[104:13.56]Just controlled it.
[104:14.18]Okay.
[104:15.81]Follow that queen.
[104:16.43]Follow that diamond queen.
[104:17.49]There we go.
[104:37.59]Stay!
[104:57.42]Call PETA.
[104:58.08]Because I told these things to stay where they are?
[105:01.25]This thing's not alive.
[105:02.75]This is a piece of paper.
[105:14.33]That's what you think.
[105:19.01]Enough.
[105:21.52]Enough, wait, don't Jenga that one, please.
[105:35.27]Paper was once a tree, so therefore it was alive.
[105:44.11]These are not alive.
[105:48.58]Do you see?
[105:49.14]Would you like to examine more closely?
[105:50.76]Does this have a pulse?
[105:53.51]Does it?
[105:54.13]You tell me.
[105:59.62]What?
[106:17.27]I gotta go.
[106:18.99]Alright, stick it in.
[106:24.67]Speed, speed, speed, speed, speed.
[106:32.91]He's getting really drunk.
[106:33.95]No, I'm not.
[106:34.53]I don't know if people say that shit like, no, I'm not.
[106:37.99]No, I'm not.
[106:40.11]I'm just getting there.
[106:41.09]I know we're getting there.
[106:42.37]I gotta make sure these are all lined up because I'm gonna do it in one go.
[106:46.21]Why is this one so fucked up looking?
[106:53.82]Does that matter?
[106:55.74]Some of these have bigger holes.
[106:56.74]You see what I'm talking about?
[106:57.36]The bigger slit there?
[107:01.86]This one's opposite of there.
[107:03.48]Oh, fuck you.
[107:08.57]I don't think it matters.
[107:09.47]Okay, it's like that.
[107:11.77]Some of them, whatever.
[107:12.67]Does that matter?
[107:15.89]I don't know if that matters or not.
[107:16.83]Let me see.
[107:22.05]No, it doesn't.
[107:27.35]Wait, maybe it does.
[107:29.17]No, it doesn't.
[107:31.81]It doesn't matter.
[107:35.83]If it does, then fuck it.
[107:36.67]We've thrown the thing in the trash.
[107:43.27]Skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny.
[107:47.81]Skinny big.
[107:48.51]Alright, they're all going in.
[107:54.70]Stop shaming me.
[107:55.68]What do you mean shaming you?
[107:58.00]What are you talking about?
[108:01.12]They're all going in at the same time.
[108:02.22]Hold your breath.
[108:03.50]Don't let nobody breathe until I get this in.
[108:10.53]You can breathe now.
[108:23.41]Shit, people are not breathing right now.
[108:29.83]I gotta do two at a time.
[108:30.73]Hold!
[108:31.03]Stay steady.
[108:43.92]Okay, you're good.
[108:45.04]Breathe.
[108:47.92]You're fine.
[108:53.94]Second one's done.
[108:54.64]Another one.
[108:58.02]Nintendo, this is getting a little ridiculous.
[108:59.96]You could have pre-packed my fucking thing.
[109:04.17]I need this, actually.
[109:05.27]Later.
[109:06.15]Right now.
[109:08.37]I'm gonna go to the very end.
[109:10.15]Because I have to do this two more times.
[109:16.48]This is fun.
[109:19.02]I never said I was having fun.
[109:21.43]Yes, I did.
[109:22.19]This is fun.
[109:23.24]I'm having a fun time.
[109:24.26]Don't listen to me.
[109:27.32]What's that, the unreliable narrator, right?
[109:31.06]Just like pretend that's what you're watching.
[109:32.58]An unreliable narrator.
[109:37.48]I look mad?
[109:38.02]Because I'm red.
[109:46.41]I'm red.
[109:48.25]I might look angry.
[109:57.97]It's meant for parents and their kids, and I'm surprised if you did enjoy it.
[110:03.21]This actually is kind of fun, folding up things and sticking it in.
[110:07.65]It's satisfying.
[110:08.37]They want me to take a break.
[110:10.79]No breaks, Nintendo.
[110:11.87]Let's get this done.
[110:18.46]So again, we're just going to go wham.
[110:25.40]What if I...
[110:27.41]No, I can't do it all in one go, because that'll... Can I?
[110:34.83]What if I did the whole thing in one go?
[110:37.33]Like, the whole thing, and then... Is that dangerous?
[110:44.87]It's too thick.
[110:46.41]Yeah, it is too thick, you're right.
[110:47.45]It wasn't designed that way.
[110:55.27]It was not designed like that.
[110:57.29]You're right, and when you're right, you're right.
[110:58.79]I'm gonna die if that happens.
[111:05.97]I don't think I'm going to die.
[111:07.01]I think it'll just be a little annoying.
[111:10.34]It's not the bee.
[111:17.38]There's no bee in here.
[111:18.36]They've been cleared away.
[111:20.20]They've been taken care of.
[111:22.66]And they weren't even bees, they were yellow jackets.
[111:24.80]They were evil, murderous little cretins.
[111:29.28]Okay, again with this bullshit.
[111:36.48]Bingo.
[111:45.35]Just do it, I'm gonna get them both done, right?
[111:47.19]I'm just gonna do them both.
[111:49.13]Try to do this speed run style.
[111:56.95]Somebody really likes that, by the way.
[112:00.37]If three people in here like that noise, then it was worth it.
[112:12.64]Would I have a sexual relationship with a bee if I was bee-sized?
[112:17.25]What the hell are you talking about?
[112:23.78]Are there other people that are people-sized that are small?
[112:27.00]That are B-sized people?
[112:32.06]You know what I'm saying?
[112:32.57]Are there other people that are as small as I am?
[112:36.91]In the B-world.
[112:48.11]No.
[112:48.99]No.
[112:50.75]Why would I do that?
[112:51.83]I would find a fucking...
[112:52.85]potion to drink to turn back to normal size.
[112:55.91]I would go track down Rick Moranis and tell him to aim the beam at me and fucking come on, man.
[113:00.99]I'll take two hours of the whole movie to get there.
[113:03.88]Befriend a couple of ants.
[113:11.30]Top, top, top.
[113:11.92]Okay.
[113:13.54]We need more anus.
[113:16.62]There is no anus on this stream ever.
[113:19.24]So why would you be asking for more of something that's never happened?
[113:22.33]You can only ask for more if you've had it before.
[113:26.20]I've never served that here.
[113:29.86]I've never served anus.
[113:31.50]It's not been something that's been on the menu, ever.
[113:33.28]Guy has no anus.
[113:54.54]Man, Labo streams really get fucking weird.
[114:00.08]I'm the only Labo streamer.
[114:03.05]And I will stand on top of this throne and drink the mightiest of all fucking wines.
[114:10.77]Okay?
[114:18.86]Woo!
[114:20.00]It wasn't open.
[114:41.65]He's still alive.
[114:45.14]I was a little late on that one.
[114:59.61]Thank God he's alright.
[115:03.15]I didn't want to have to put him down the fucking disposal in a drain.
[115:11.39]Finish the bottle or you're lightweight.
[115:13.84]Do you know how much I weigh?
[115:15.06]Do you have any idea?
[115:17.44]You do understand that I am lighter of a person.
[115:20.76]I'm 150 something pounds.
[115:21.84]Like, what do you mean?
[115:23.72]You guys act like I'm like fucking 220 and like 6'4".
[115:31.88]Fat.
[115:32.12]I'm not fat.
[115:32.64]Does this look fat to you?
[115:45.02]Hey, what about these sounds?
[115:53.93]Pregnant.
[115:58.55]Does this look fucking fat to you?
[115:59.95]I don't think so.
[116:14.99]I'm in the peak physical condition of a male of my size.
[116:21.85]Look it up.
[116:22.77]Look up BMI.
[116:25.17]Male, five, seven and a half.
[116:27.51]Five, eight on a good day.
[116:29.46]Put that in the Google search.
[116:32.76]BMI.
[116:34.16]Tell me what it is.
[116:42.62]So no, I'm five, eight.
[116:52.25]5'8 soaking wet.
[117:05.19]How big is... You think I'm going to answer that fucked up question?
[117:10.81]Really?
[117:12.49]You think I'm going to answer a question like that?
[117:13.89]Out of your mind?
[117:22.54]These are all connected, yeah.
[117:23.58]Alright, we're almost done with the pistons.
[117:26.48]Thank God.
[117:27.12]Well, this has been kind of fun, though.
[117:37.95]This has been a little bit fun, don't you think?
[117:39.67]Am I going the right way with these stupid fucking things?
[117:45.32]Wait, hold on.
[117:48.72]Like that.
[117:55.84]One, two, three.
[117:56.62]That's not fun?
[118:02.79]How could you not be having fun right now?
[118:04.31]I'm sliding white pieces of paper into a little slot and that's it.
[118:09.55]That's the whole stream for the last like 35 minutes.
[118:12.37]You're not having any fun?
[118:14.65]You're not having any fun right now?
[118:16.11]Oh my God, it's stuck.
[118:29.74]There we go.
[118:30.24]Pack it in there nice and tight.
[118:31.42]Alright.
[118:33.28]These are all done.
[118:34.26]So now what do I do with them?
[118:37.37]Take a break.
[118:38.55]Actually, I might take a piss.
[118:45.67]Yeah, I'm getting out of here for this.
[118:47.11]I'm going to pee.
[118:47.59]I'll be right back.
[118:50.49]Don't leave.
[118:51.49]Well, you can if you want.
[118:52.43]See you later.
[121:19.19]Why does it smell like cinnamon in here?
[121:23.32]That doesn't make any sense.
[121:24.10]Why does it smell like cinnamon sugar in here?
[121:30.72]It's not bad.
[121:35.21]Thank God he's back.
[121:36.39]I'm back.
[121:36.87]I'm back.
[121:37.51]Chill.
[121:45.95]You know what I really hope doesn't happen when my great-great-great-great-grandchildren watch this pod?
[121:51.16]I hope they don't see the chat right now.
[121:54.38]I hope they skip this part.
[121:56.66]Okay.
[122:06.41]Ah, I get the four strings out.
[122:07.63]There should be two of the light blue strings and two of the orange strings.
[122:16.24]Looks correct to me.
[122:17.43]We got, Oh my God.
[122:22.48]Yeah.
[122:22.92]One.
[122:23.08]I'll show you guys a quick little trick on how to take care of, if you have a long string or a hose or something.
[122:41.49]And then you can just stick it on your shelf.
[122:42.79]Fuck.
[122:43.59]Alright, let's go.
[122:44.90]I've ruined it.
[122:45.42]This is tangled now.
[122:46.44]I hope I don't have to use that for anything important.
[122:50.80]I got a better... Okay, I'm going to treat these like fucking parrots, okay?
[122:54.76]I got a red parrot.
[122:55.54]I got two red parrots and I got two blue parrots.
[123:04.29]Blue parrots are going to shit on the... Blue parrots are hopefully going to shit on me.
[123:07.99]Sit on the left shoulder for blue parrot.
[123:11.97]Red parrot's gonna sit on the right shoulder.
[123:13.27]Because I will tangle these up and lose them.
[123:17.06]Okay, there we go.
[123:24.20]I'm good.
[123:24.50]What do you want me to do with these?
[123:31.26]Start with the light blue one.
[123:32.32]We'll need to tie it securely to the power piston.
[123:39.29]Oh, by the way, I'm drinking out of a glass.
[123:42.16]from one of my all-time favorite movies, as you can tell.
[123:46.06]The Godfather.
[123:48.52]Classic American cinema.
[123:53.87]So this goes... It's a top-rated movie.
[124:01.99]Yes, it is.
[124:02.61]Alright, so raise both tabs a little bit, then lower them to hold the string in place.
[124:06.75]Just like this.
[124:14.48]Like that.
[124:19.45]Okay.
[124:20.79]So that's there.
[124:25.39]We're going to tie the string into two knots.
[124:27.83]Tie the first knot, but make sure to leave enough tail for the second one.
[124:42.83]Okay.
[124:45.62]So why is that string so small?
[124:54.03]So we go... Leave enough room for the second one.
[125:09.48]So it has to be like that.
[125:12.08]So go like this.
[125:19.19]Okay, so then leave enough room for a second knot.
[125:27.57]Tie the second knot right on top of the first.
[125:29.69]If you're having trouble, ask a friendly robot for help or an adult.
[125:33.31]I don't need you, Dad.
[125:34.07]I don't need you, Dad.
[125:37.27]Like this.
[125:37.87]I actually need someone to put their finger here.
[125:56.76]Okay, that's done.
[126:02.62]Like that.
[126:05.50]Okay, now to do this to like all these?
[126:09.38]He's doing it on the wrong side.
[126:10.68]What do you mean the wrong side?
[126:12.26]No, it's right there, look.
[126:15.74]You can stick the rest of the short string to the power piston from the small gap.
[126:20.60]Just slide it in here.
[126:21.46]Okay, that's two knots.
[126:25.20]I did it on the right side.
[126:26.32]Don't ever question me.
[126:30.94]Okay, so that's in there.
[126:40.35]Like that, okay.
[126:42.85]So that would I have to keep going across?
[126:45.29]Does the spring go over the two tabs?
[126:47.31]Make sure it's the same as in the video.
[126:49.17]Yes, it does.
[126:54.74]Now fold these two tabs in the lid of the box so they're standing.
[126:57.94]Oh, slow down.
[127:06.47]Like this, so they're standing up.
[127:11.71]Take the string and feed it through the narrow opening.
[127:14.34]You better have an end game here, Nintendo.
[127:16.90]Don't you dare fucking like at the end of this play like the gnome video.
[127:25.94]No, the stream's dying.
[127:30.46]What the fuck was that?
[127:35.94]Don't you dare fucking turn the stream off, Comcast.
[127:40.99]That just dropped like 150 frames in five seconds.
[127:47.15]I think we're okay.
[127:49.39]Don't you fucking dare.
[127:51.69]We good?
[127:51.99]We're good, right?
[127:54.72]That's bad.
[127:55.36]The clouds are looming right now, guys.
[127:57.09]That's not cool.
[127:59.17]Hopefully it doesn't happen again.
[128:01.25]So pass it all the way through.
[128:03.71]All the way through and then all the way through.
[128:04.93]Keep going.
[128:06.65]Fold it as you're closing the lid.
[128:08.21]Okay, so fold it all the way through.
[128:13.80]Like that.
[128:14.08]Do we need any slack?
[128:20.04]Firmly slide the long upper tab into the opening and then close it.
[128:24.90]Okay.
[128:26.80]So, like that.
[128:29.82]And then this closes.
[128:30.92]I don't know, I didn't have my breakfast for this shit.
[128:37.12]Okay.
[128:49.49]The tabs are getting in the way.
[128:52.18]The white things are in the way.
[128:59.48]The weights are getting in the way.
[129:01.25]Here we go.
[129:01.71]Okay.
[129:02.75]Got it.
[129:08.91]Tab.
[129:09.19]What do we need tabs?
[129:10.01]Tabs.
[129:10.23]Let's talk about tabs.
[129:20.60]God damn it.
[129:26.88]There you go.
[129:27.48]It's alright.
[129:28.12]Everything's fine.
[129:30.02]Put your pitchforks down.
[129:35.16]Done.
[129:36.24]Secure.
[129:37.58]There it is.
[129:40.74]So now that one probably goes somewhere.
[129:42.76]No.
[129:43.08]What do you mean no?
[129:43.72]I did it right.
[129:46.95]How is that wrong?
[129:47.55]Grab the other light blue string.
[129:51.11]Got it.
[129:54.56]Tying it to another power piston.
[129:55.94]Okay, so we're going to do just the same thing over and over again.
[129:59.36]I'm going to move you up here.
[130:02.28]Alright.
[130:02.70]Again, raise the tab and use the string.
[130:04.56]I hope I get to punch a wall down as the robot.
[130:14.16]Okay, there we go.
[130:16.87]Same deal.
[130:17.73]Tie it.
[130:18.79]I think I folded this too tightly, though.
[130:20.91]Dumb fucking idiot.
[130:22.07]Alright.
[130:23.11]Yeah.
[130:25.07]yeah my father when he used to be asleep he would do this thing where if you started talking to him he would pretend like he was awake and he was asleep so you'd be like he'd be lying on the couch just passed out completely asleep you know whether he was taking a nap or whatever and you'd be like uh hey dad yeah he wasn't he was not awake
[130:53.24]Hey, are we going to the store later?
[130:57.00]Yeah.
[130:59.48]Dad, what's the Red Sox record right now?
[131:03.98]Yes.
[131:05.84]It was fucking hilarious.
[131:07.00]Didn't matter what you said.
[131:07.72]So this goes like this.
[131:17.05]Around, just tie it, simple knot.
[131:21.96]My sister does that.
[131:22.76]It's actually, it's really funny.
[131:25.20]And then do the whole thing again.
[131:26.22]I'm going out for cigarettes.
[131:33.27]That didn't happen.
[131:35.91]Fuck off.
[131:39.99]You guys are fucking jokers.
[131:43.73]This doesn't feel that tight though.
[131:45.85]Something in my eye.
[131:46.71]Get it.
[131:51.79]Tell us the phone story.
[131:52.85]What do you mean the phone story?
[132:01.23]A bee story.
[132:05.78]It's done.
[132:06.56]Tuck the little piece that is still here.
[132:08.66]Hey, look at that.
[132:11.66]Nice and snug.
[132:14.82]Same deal, we're gonna close it up through the hole.
[132:16.66]Yeah.
[132:24.28]Fuck.
[132:24.90]No!
[132:30.96]Wait.
[132:31.62]Wait.
[132:33.42]Nobody move.
[132:34.60]Don't anybody move.
[132:37.20]I don't want to see any movement here.
[132:43.26]We're good.
[132:46.21]We're good.
[132:46.95]We're still going.
[132:55.91]We're still live.
[132:58.05]God damn it, really?
[132:59.73]The stream that I picked to drink and do the Labo, you're gonna kill me?
[133:04.89]You're gonna kill my stream now?
[133:07.97]Come on, I just wanna have a couple of drinks and hang out with my friends.
[133:15.42]That's probably gonna happen a little bit, so just bear with it.
[133:17.86]Sorry, guys.
[133:20.02]Sorry that we have to deal with a company like Comcast.
[133:26.91]That has this crumbling fucking infrastructure across the entire state of Massachusetts.
[133:35.43]And they just don't fucking give a shit.
[133:40.56]Sorry.
[133:42.08]Won't be like that for long now, will it?
[133:44.76]Be in a different state soon enough.
[133:46.10]Okay, so that one's good.
[133:47.50]Gonna do the orange ones now.
[133:54.67]Yeah, it sucks.
[133:55.17]It sucks.
[133:56.64]I wish there was something I could do.
[133:58.44]But don't speak so soon.
[133:59.76]We're fine.
[134:00.34]Everything's fine.
[134:02.50]I'm hoping that we can do this whole thing before the whole stream dies.
[134:09.48]That would be so irritating if it does.
[134:12.45]My irritation levels will reach boiling point.
[134:16.17]You'll be able to cook fucking eggs inside of me.
[134:18.39]Alright, same thing.
[134:21.39]Let's get this done fairly quickly because I know exactly what it wants me to do.
[134:25.37]What's with the color code here?
[134:28.81]I wonder.
[134:30.73]I wonder.
[134:32.27]Just skip all these videos.
[134:34.20]Because I know what to do.
[134:37.50]Skip, skip, skip, skip.
[134:38.84]I know what you want me to do.
[134:39.80]Skip, skip, skip.
[134:40.44]All of it.
[134:43.26]That is portal colors.
[134:44.08]You're right.
[134:45.46]Good observation.
[134:48.90]You're going places.
[134:49.49]I can tell you right now.
[134:51.57]You are.
[134:57.26]this tie round again before we lose our connection.
[135:09.19]It's alright.
[135:12.93]That don't matter.
[135:13.53]Get that in there.
[135:14.45]I made it a little too long.
[135:18.21]I made it just a little bit too long.
[135:20.77]I may have fucked it up a little bit, you know.
[135:23.74]At the end of the day, don't really matter, does it?
[135:26.90]OK.
[135:31.06]this education get connected for free at education connection I went on the internet and went to education connection I want to realize and find out my direction get connected for free and I'm just giving an ad does that company still exist
[136:03.87]Probably not.
[136:09.97]Hey, you can tell everybody in here that used to watch TV at three or four in the morning because that song was played.
[136:15.27]That commercial played like seven times from 3 a.m.
[136:18.73]to 6 a.m.
[136:23.86]It's that one.
[136:24.86]Cool.
[136:27.94]It was all day?
[136:28.58]I remember it was on very late at night.
[136:30.74]I didn't catch it on...
[136:32.73]a lot during the daytime.
[136:37.51]Get this one done.
[136:38.29]And then these probably, where did these go?
[136:42.64]I'm confused.
[136:44.12]Oh, I lost it.
[136:47.92]I'm not American.
[136:48.58]What is it?
[136:49.00]It was this thing where it would try to get you to sign up for college or certificate programs.
[136:54.66]It was a thing that just kept saying, hey, you got to go to school.
[136:57.24]You have to go to school.
[136:57.82]You have to go to school.
[136:58.96]Get to school.
[136:59.52]You got to find a way into school.
[137:01.76]There was that one too.
[137:04.01]I can't get a job if I don't have any skills.
[137:06.83]I don't have any skills because I didn't go to school.
[137:09.16]I didn't go to school because I don't have any money.
[137:10.62]I don't have any money because I don't have a job.
[137:12.40]I don't have a job because I didn't go to school.
[137:14.38]I didn't go to school.
[137:14.90]I don't have any skills.
[137:16.08]And it kept going.
[137:17.04]It kept going.
[137:17.42]It kept going.
[137:20.86]I didn't go to school.
[137:21.54]I didn't go to school.
[137:22.18]I didn't go to school.
[137:26.55]I thought that was always just Massachusetts, but apparently not.
[137:36.05]Okay, stick it in there.
[137:37.05]Okay, these are all done.
[137:46.93]Stuff that in there.
[137:47.93]That's a little loose.
[137:50.41]That's a little on the loose side.
[137:51.84]I don't know if I like that.
[137:54.28]But it's not like it's going to be a problem.
[137:56.22]This thing was made for somebody to fuck it up like me.
[138:08.23]OK.
[138:09.99]Looking good.
[138:10.82]Fold these in.
[138:11.64]Don't worry.
[138:12.48]I won't miss it.
[138:13.22]I know a lot of people think I'm going to miss it.
[138:16.20]But did I?
[138:17.24]No.
[138:22.73]This one feels a little packed.
[138:28.07]Oh, freecreditreport.com.
[138:29.83]Tell your kids, tell your dog, tell your mom.
[138:40.61]I'm a sellout now.
[138:41.45]Hey, do you need a quick break?
[138:47.01]Alright, here we go.
[138:47.99]We're making the backpack.
[138:51.10]I am so excited for this.
[138:53.82]What do I do with these?
[138:54.68]Okay, where's the visor?
[138:56.26]I'm going to put these next to the visor.
[138:59.89]I got the fucking guy on strings, I'll tell you.
[139:12.53]Okay, those are out in the other side.
[139:16.96]Okay, remove two pieces from sheets E and G. That's fine, we're good.
[139:28.04]This one?
[139:35.97]Don't need this anymore.
[139:44.01]So E and G, this is the whole thing.
[139:45.31]This is the main body.
[139:46.43]This is the backpack.
[139:49.05]Well, that's a lot of money that just came in right now.
[139:51.54]A lot of money, huge money.
[139:57.86]Who just gave that?
[139:58.46]Banana Slamma Junior, thank you for the $50.
[140:00.72]Thank you.
[140:05.48]Moved up from the South to the greater Boston area a few months ago for a new job with my previously long distance girlfriend.
[140:11.91]Just to hear the news about you moving.
[140:13.99]It can be daunting moving so far from home, but your streams help me get by when I feel lonely.
[140:19.45]Love the streams and good luck with your new life in Vegas.
[140:22.70]Put it all on double zero for me when you get there.
[140:26.64]You want me to put 50 bucks on double zero?
[140:30.14]I'll do that if you really want me to.
[140:33.96]If I hit it, I'll send you fucking 80%.
[140:41.38]Just saying.
[140:44.78]All in.
[140:47.68]No, but seriously though, thank you, man.
[140:50.88]Yeah, moving is going to be a pain in the ass.
[140:53.38]It's starting to creep up on me a little bit here because I've never lived anywhere besides New England.
[141:01.93]So you're talking about...
[141:04.37]Trying to, first of all, trying to get a place in Vegas is very hard.
[141:08.64]They go so fucking quickly.
[141:10.14]It's hard to even get a lease or like an apartment.
[141:14.28]It's very difficult to do that.
[141:16.16]So I have to go back and forth a couple of times in the next couple months just to get a place signed.
[141:23.43]So it's going to be hectic and it's not going to be fun, but it's necessary for sure.
[141:30.01]So I appreciate the encouragement.
[141:34.76]I'm glad you moved up here.
[141:35.78]Boston's a great place to be.
[141:38.17]There's a lot of shit to do here, a lot of cool stuff.
[141:43.39]But I have to part ways with it for obvious reasons.
[141:51.67]G. But thank you again, BananaSlaveJr.
[141:55.59]Thank you so much, man.
[141:57.17]That's a lot of fucking money.
[141:59.29]Where's G?
[142:07.97]This is not even the right thing.
[142:08.93]This is F. But F is huge.
[142:11.14]This is not right.
[142:11.78]I need G. You stay right there, dude.
[142:14.90]There's G. So I need the top part of G. And I did say I have to make this clear again.
[142:32.68]There's going to be a couple of weeks where you might not have... There might not be more than one stream on this channel.
[142:39.70]Near the end of August and a couple of weeks into September, it's going to be really, really tough to go live.
[142:45.90]And then again in October, it's just... I'm going to try.
[142:49.86]I have a couple of ideas that I want to try to do to make it so there's something here.
[142:56.08]I'm going to try.
[142:57.62]You'll see something.
[142:58.30]Don't worry.
[142:58.96]I'm not going to abandon you guys.
[143:00.02]Come on.
[143:04.41]is it not cut here it's not cut they didn't cut it it's not they didn't cut this part look at this they didn't even cut it really it's not even I'm gonna rip it yeah it's not cut wow you me Nintendo I might have to get scissors
[143:40.06]It's ripped.
[143:42.14]Look it.
[143:42.66]Ripped it.
[143:43.28]Fucking ruined it.
[143:46.02]God damn it.
[143:46.68]Oh well.
[143:47.18]Fine.
[143:48.74]Let's take the loss.
[143:50.58]Alright.
[143:51.46]That comes out.
[143:52.36]That comes out.
[143:54.63]All of these little circles have to come out.
[143:56.37]No, it's all jacked up.
[143:57.63]What the hell, man?
[143:59.73]This piece went through manufacturing incorrectly.
[144:03.93]Look at this.
[144:04.41]Look at how cheap this one is.
[144:07.77]Soiled it, man.
[144:11.77]Take this loss from Nintendo.
[144:13.21]Okay, we can salvage this, this is fine.
[144:18.70]Good to go, one little bit here that needs to move.
[144:25.96]Almost just dropped a bunch of frames right there.
[144:28.38]That was lucky.
[144:29.10]$50 for that high quality cardboard.
[144:33.94]Uh, 80 actually.
[144:35.84]$80. 80.
[144:44.59]If you bought two Labos, you would almost have an entire Switch.
[144:47.62]$80.
[144:49.78]Let's go.
[144:54.66]Oh God, I gotta remove the big boy, okay.
[145:00.87]The huge guy here.
[145:01.55]Oh my Lord, oh God, okay.
[145:07.99]Is that it?
[145:11.27]Is the whole, this whole thing, is that out?
[145:14.40]I can't even tell if that's out.
[145:18.51]That's out, I think.
[145:21.21]It is, okay.
[145:22.13]I gotta put that.
[145:24.51]Look at all these little things I have to punch out, really.
[145:26.39]Dude, come on.
[145:35.01]Two holes right here.
[145:35.92]I don't have a big enough area for this.
[145:48.10]This is what I lift for?
[145:49.18]What do you mean?
[145:51.78]This is what I lift for.
[145:54.96]Although, here's the one good thing about this.
[145:56.28]This will go together very quickly.
[145:59.47]We'll punch this together and this won't be long at all.
[146:03.87]I'll drink to that, you know what I'm saying?
[146:12.50]Almost.
[146:12.84]Almost.
[146:16.76]And what is this cheap shit, Nintendo?
[146:18.60]Come on.
[146:21.16]It's this cheap-ass fucking cardboard you got me here.
[146:24.76]You know, I think that Nintendo Labo would be a really great gift for a loved one on Christmas.
[146:32.76]I think if you put this under the tree, one of your friends or your relatives would be like, what?
[146:38.44]It's so interesting and different.
[146:39.72]And Christmas morning, you could do it with them.
[146:42.33]You know what I mean?
[146:42.75]You could do this together with your friend or a loved one or a relative or a grandmother or a father or a grandpa and you would have a lot of fun on Christmas morning.
[146:52.65]I actually got this for my birthday and it was pretty awesome.
[147:06.78]See, that's what I'm talking about.
[147:09.50]As long as you didn't have to pay for it, this is the best thing in the world.
[147:14.53]You know what I mean?
[147:14.99]If you didn't buy it, then hell, fucking cool.
[147:17.15]I'll build a little robot.
[147:18.21]That sounds like fun.
[147:26.44]Those of you that paid for it, though.
[147:35.45]Okay.
[147:36.13]Nope.
[147:39.71]Looks like a chore.
[147:40.51]It actually is kind of fun.
[147:43.05]You know, for a loved one, or a friend of yours, or a family.
[147:47.51]You sit down and read a book and do it at the same time.
[147:49.65]Alright, that's done.
[147:55.80]This one, okay, hold on, am I doing the whole thing first?
[148:00.08]So is this the right way?
[148:01.14]My desk, my area's not big enough.
[148:02.90]So this comes here, like that.
[148:09.21]Spin it around like this.
[148:14.20]Fold up all the triangular little thingies.
[148:17.16]This thing here.
[148:22.11]What the fuck is going on here?
[148:23.03]Nintendo Labo.
[148:36.04]What the fuck is going on here?
[148:38.44]Like the cops just showed up.
[148:40.22]Hey!
[148:40.90]What's happening here?
[148:41.70]What are you kids doing?
[148:43.05]Nothing, just building cardboard, man.
[148:45.41]Okay.
[148:48.75]Uh, that's correct, right?
[148:52.27]Jesus, man.
[148:52.73]This thing's so awkward and huge.
[149:00.66]He opens up the fucking backpack.
[149:01.88]There's like a bunch of coke in there.
[149:04.14]I knew it!
[149:05.70]We got reports of kids behind Coke in their Labo backpacks.
[149:10.63]You're going away for a long fucking time.
[149:14.07]Take out six sheets of gray colored... Where are those?
[149:16.97]I don't know what those are.
[149:21.49]Remember I told you to keep track of them?
[149:23.59]Where are they?
[149:28.72]Thank you!
[149:29.10]They're right next to the mouse.
[149:33.00]Take out all six of them.
[149:37.87]One, two, three, four.
[149:45.15]Are there even six in here?
[149:50.37]Four, five.
[149:52.03]Okay, and I need to watch six of these.
[150:07.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Got it!
[150:09.55]Nice and tight.
[150:38.76]Okay, take them out, they're there.
[150:41.28]They're there.
[150:41.78]Isn't the N language funny?
[150:43.50]They're there, they're there.
[150:46.49]Where am I?
[150:52.03]This is gonna be hard.
[150:59.32]Okay, so they all have to go one, two, three, four, five, all six have to go in here.
[151:05.02]These holes don't really line up that well, but I guess, whatever.
[151:08.99]Okay, let's start with the hole at the far left.
[151:11.95]Push the grommet through and then tighten it.
[151:14.00]I'm going to make sure these are lined up well enough where I can put them in.
[151:24.14]They look like they're okay.
[151:26.09]I dropped it.
[151:26.51]Thank God it went right on my leg.
[151:38.84]It's one.
[151:40.42]Alright, next one at the very end.
[151:42.42]Why am I doing it opposite like this?
[151:44.82]Seems kind of stupid.
[151:46.00]Let's do it in a row.
[151:57.63]No.
[152:02.43]Why are we doing it like this?
[152:03.53]I'm just putting them in.
[152:04.65]I don't care.
[152:06.33]Why are we going opposite ends?
[152:10.69]Spicy snap.
[152:13.07]That was a little spicy.
[152:14.27]You're right.
[152:20.39]I'm still doing it the way they said on the video.
[152:21.95]I don't know why.
[152:24.57]Fucking idiot.
[152:24.99]I'm going to be just following instructions.
[152:29.21]Following directions.
[152:34.93]Okay.
[152:36.67]Okay.
[152:40.20]This is
[152:43.14]Nice little snap.
[152:47.44]You can tell that this Bionicle is going to be a good one.
[152:53.02]Didn't Bionicles used to take like three months to build them?
[153:05.89]You know what?
[153:06.29]I want to make a boat in one of those bottles.
[153:07.73]You know what I mean?
[153:11.85]I want to take a boat and I want to stick it in the bottle.
[153:14.14]I don't know how they do that.
[153:14.88]They build it with little tweezers and they stick it in and they make the boat.
[153:18.52]I want to do that so bad.
[153:21.08]Get some goddamn respect.
[153:23.36]One final hat.
[153:24.28]Glorious, aren't they?
[153:25.14]And now the hook is locked into place.
[153:28.10]What?
[153:30.16]Oh, okay.
[153:30.56]It was just being weird.
[153:35.10]Now let's crease the fold lines on the mainframe.
[153:36.96]You can leave the bits on the sides folded up slightly.
[153:40.55]So just pull these in, okay, so right here.
[153:42.77]Can you guys see this?
[153:45.07]This is a big guy.
[153:46.15]I feel like I'm dissecting a tuna.
[153:49.39]Oh, there's a big one here.
[153:54.39]You can see this, right?
[153:56.49]Can you see this?
[153:57.26]Good.
[154:01.88]Jeremy, you are epic.
[154:04.52]Do you think so?
[154:05.38]Thanks, man.
[154:08.23]It's kind of fun to fold these big pieces, huh?
[154:10.01]It actually is much more fun than making the stupid little fucking tape things.
[154:14.03]Alright, hold on a minute.
[154:16.91]This is getting weird.
[154:18.35]So fold all this shit.
[154:23.54]You guys can't see that.
[154:28.30]Jerma, I'm handsome.
[154:30.38]Good.
[154:31.73]That's cool, man.
[154:36.31]Alright, nice.
[154:38.95]What do you want me to say with that?
[154:40.85]What's the correct response?
[154:41.81]I don't know.
[154:42.15]How do you want me to respond to that?
[154:46.66]Okay, then these... These then go in here, right?
[154:55.22]Yeah.
[154:56.26]Stick these two tabs into the small slots.
[154:57.92]Looks a little like someone putting their hands into their pockets, don't you think?
[155:04.11]No, that looks like an upside-down emoji guy going like... Like, oh no!
[155:09.24]Get it right, Nintendo.
[155:10.04]Come on, I'll get on your creative team.
[155:12.61]Add me.
[155:13.95]Add me on Twitter.
[155:27.21]I refuse to follow you back, though, just in case you're wondering.
[155:33.70]Your wisdom tooth hurts?
[155:34.46]I'm sorry, dude.
[155:36.72]Did you get it pulled out?
[155:38.88]Alright, now I'll attach the first side panel to this fucking thing.
[155:47.41]So this goes into this.
[155:54.23]There are lots of fold lines here.
[155:55.55]Let's get bopping.
[155:57.05]Let's get booping?
[155:57.83]Okay, just tons of fold lines.
[156:06.32]Let's get booping, guys.
[156:15.59]Hey, let's get pooping.
[156:18.57]I'm going to get Nintendo'd on stream.
[156:20.05]What does that mean?
[156:20.53]They're going to claim my videos?
[156:23.26]They're going to copyright strike my stream?
[156:33.70]I'm a savage?
[156:36.62]I don't think so.
[156:37.18]I think I'm fairly civilized.
[156:46.27]Copyright cardboard.
[156:47.36]I mean, this is patented.
[156:48.52]It has to be, right?
[156:56.06]For a drunk.
[157:00.40]What?
[157:03.16]What are you talking about?
[157:06.54]Alright, so now lift up the bottom of the frame so it's standing up.
[157:09.45]So the part with the funny face.
[157:11.79]So like this.
[157:17.20]Okay, then pick up the side panel, get ready to fit the two together.
[157:24.90]If it's hard to hold up, ask someone to help you.
[157:26.72]I don't, this is supposed to be able to be done by yourself.
[157:31.02]Pick up the side panel and get ready to lift to ask someone for help.
[157:37.21]This is supposed, I'm supposed to be able to do this by myself.
[157:51.29]So this goes in like this.
[157:54.95]What in the name of God are you trying to get me to do by myself?
[158:01.64]So this comes up.
[158:06.32]I got this the wrong way.
[158:07.26]I got it the wrong way.
[158:09.64]No, I don't.
[158:10.16]This is this wrong way.
[158:11.18]This is the right way.
[158:13.68]What side do I have this on?
[158:15.18]I got it on the wrong side.
[158:19.74]That's why, it's gotta go here.
[158:21.52]Alright, so watch out for these tabs.
[158:31.81]So these come up, these stay up.
[158:35.55]You really do need like four hands for this shit.
[158:38.33]By the way, these tabs need to be bent before I do this.
[158:44.68]That, okay.
[158:46.04]So this comes up, this goes here.
[158:50.58]Like that.
[158:57.47]Get up here, you little shit.
[159:00.77]That goes in.
[159:01.49]God damn it.
[159:08.48]I didn't bend this one.
[159:26.03]It's in, it's in, it's in.
[159:27.23]Okay, it's in.
[159:29.47]Now I'm gonna go downtown here, downstairs.
[159:31.64]Now that that part's commenced, stand the whole thing up.
[159:38.04]Ah!
[159:38.98]It's okay.
[159:45.22]Okay.
[159:46.78]We're standing up.
[159:47.62]At this point, we'll want to make sure two, we want to make two more double locks.
[159:51.63]That's four locks in total.
[159:52.75]Wow, ahem, starts with the bottom.
[159:56.79]Get that out of the way.
[159:58.41]Stick the tab on the panel and then in.
[160:00.37]It's gonna hit me in the face.
[160:12.56]You really do need somebody to hold this.
[160:18.74]This one up here.
[160:19.34]I'm gonna get them both at the same time.
[160:33.06]there stick this up top here don't try this at home no don't you'll get hurt you're gonna get hurt if you do this by yourself that one that's why don't don't do the other side just turn it on this sideways like this
[161:00.47]Phew, it's hard work when the parts are so large.
[161:02.05]Might need a snap snoon.
[161:19.70]What is this piece?
[161:23.16]I don't have this one.
[161:24.76]Where is that?
[161:27.28]Oh.
[161:28.68]Like H.
[161:34.92]Big one in H. You got it.
[161:38.44]The whole thing.
[161:38.96]It's only one piece.
[161:48.71]That's it.
[161:54.87]I need a drink?
[161:56.83]Hey, you don't gotta tell me when I need to drink or not, okay?
[162:00.19]This ain't one of those streams where I'm gonna drink when somebody tells me to.
[162:20.11]I'm doing this on my own terms.
[162:23.17]I'm doing this on my own.
[162:27.83]Nobody told me to do that.
[162:29.62]I'm doing it on my own.
[162:33.00]You thought I was just pouring it onto the carpet?
[162:35.26]Just like, yeah, whatever, I don't give a shit.
[162:38.98]That would be a waste of alcohol.
[162:40.33]That stuff's not cheap.
[162:41.51]That's like nine bucks.
[162:42.83]No, that's like 12 bucks.
[162:46.48]And what would be more fun?
[162:47.90]Like drinking eight of these or playing the Labo for four hours?
[162:56.18]That's for you to decide, not me.
[163:02.66]Do both?
[163:05.58]You could.
[163:05.90]Alright, let's go.
[163:09.18]You guys, the payoff is gonna be big.
[163:11.61]Just wait till I accidentally put a hole in my wall being a robot.
[163:14.53]It's gonna be so funny.
[163:20.24]I really don't want to give myself that kind of curse, but you know.
[163:31.89]How's everybody doing, by the way, tonight?
[163:33.59]You guys doing good?
[163:37.29]You guys like having a good time?
[163:40.27]You guys like a little sleepy?

[163:56.85]Alright, I got, now we need G, hold on.
[163:59.33]I got all the pieces out of that, right?
[164:01.43]G, where's G?
[164:03.51]Ah!
[164:05.35]There's G, what do we need from G?
[164:07.04]We need the two pieces that look like that.
[164:12.20]These aren't connected, right?
[164:13.28]No.
[164:18.59]Play Doom.
[164:23.36]Do you see what's going on here right now?
[164:25.38]Like I can't play Doom right now.
[164:27.54]I can't just play Doom right now.
[164:30.60]That I like, look, I'm fucking in the middle of something.
[164:34.15]Do you like, do you see what's going on here?
[164:39.79]I'm not gonna play Doom.
[164:40.77]No, we're not playing Doom.
[164:41.71]I'm not playing Doom.
[164:57.96]Let's go.
[164:59.48]I got the pieces I needed.
[165:02.11]Fucking, why do you want to play Doom?
[165:07.03]Don't knock that over.
[165:14.51]As usual.
[165:16.81]Jeremy, your dad is... Every time I play this fucking Labo game,
[165:27.53]Everybody just fucks with me.
[165:32.25]What was that?
[165:32.61]Did I just like spit an old timey Western spit into a can?
[165:35.97]What the hell was that?
[165:37.67]It was like .
[165:40.76]What am I, in a saloon?
[165:41.70]The world is closing in.
[165:46.14]Alright, go.
[165:49.24]I need this.
[165:49.94]This is the other side, okay.
[166:02.06]I don't have any more room, so I know you guys can't see it.
[166:03.98]And I know that's bad content, bad streamer.
[166:06.52]Hold on.
[166:08.15]I'll get it for you guys.
[166:14.05]There we go.
[166:22.43]So close.
[166:26.33]What are we so close on again?
[166:31.21]Alright, the next person that says play Doom is permanently banned from the channel.
[166:45.76]Got a lot of people that don't want to be here no more.
[166:47.44]There's like 3000 banned people.
[167:02.52]With a snap of my fingers, all of chat will cease to exist.
[167:13.99]Okay, that's good.
[167:17.75]What the fuck?
[167:18.05]I didn't see... What are you talking about?
[167:21.75]Doom.
[167:22.15]That's... Sorry, I gave you a Doom spoiler, okay?
[167:26.40]Doom.
[167:31.50]Not playing Doom.
[167:33.59]Alright.
[167:37.97]Spin it around.
[167:38.71]I don't want to lose these pieces in here.
[167:42.47]Okay, it's fine.
[167:43.05]It almost fell off, but I got it.
[167:49.54]Think you'd fuck with me?
[167:50.62]How does this go?
[167:55.40]Like this?
[167:55.76]I don't know.
[167:57.96]How does this go?
[168:04.50]Yeah, OK.
[168:06.12]So this has to attach.
[168:08.72]Stick this in there with the tabs facing the correct way.
[168:12.40]Just give me one second.
[168:23.11]It's so close.
[168:23.83]That drink is falling.
[168:24.87]If that drink falls, I will delete my Twitch account.
[168:31.93]Oh, shit.
[168:32.27]Oh, look.
[168:32.59]There it goes.
[168:45.06]fall isn't it repeated joke fine if that drink falls if I if that drink falls I won't stream for a week I'll go to like on vacation or something you really do need two hands
[169:07.82]I need someone to help me do this.
[169:10.02]Hey, dude.
[169:11.14]You right there.
[169:12.54]You.
[169:12.88]I'm talking to you.
[169:14.34]In the red shirt.
[169:15.12]Yes.
[169:15.98]Can you put your finger over here?
[169:17.10]Just, like, put your finger right here.
[169:19.66]Yes, you.
[169:20.08]Okay, put it down.
[169:25.52]Yeah, right there.
[169:26.08]That's good.
[169:29.38]You're doing a great job.
[169:30.00]Thanks, man.
[169:30.66]Nice.
[169:30.92]Okay, you can take your finger away.
[169:32.86]Thank you so much, David Smith.
[169:36.33]One of you guys got fucking real freaked out.
[169:43.27]Okay, that's in.
[169:44.23]Now what?
[169:47.93]Turn it upside down here.
[169:50.33]Like that.
[169:58.42]So we're on the left side again.
[170:01.46]Same as before, lock it in place.
[170:13.26]Am I the only person to ever stream this game?
[170:16.84]Look it up.
[170:27.17]No.
[170:31.22]There it is.
[170:32.30]Ah, it's in.
[170:34.88]Is this a game?
[170:35.66]Yes, it is.
[170:36.30]How is this not a game?
[170:44.77]And there we go.
[170:45.73]Don't, easy, don't, I just almost broke it.
[170:50.72]It looks like work.
[170:51.96]It is, it is work.
[170:57.90]It's a toy, not a game.
[170:59.19]That doesn't matter.
[170:59.77]Alright, the two little pieces.
[171:12.36]Not happening on this string.
[171:14.34]Alright, these two pieces, time to shine.
[171:15.92]Okay, fold them up.
[171:22.04]Somebody is texting the fuck out of me right now.
[171:24.62]Leave me alone.
[171:29.17]What is this?
[171:29.57]Okay, so this comes in.
[171:41.66]Flip it around for what?
[171:46.05]like this.
[171:50.63]Same thing with the other side.
[171:54.27]Call your dad.
[171:56.82]My dad's fine.
[171:57.46]I talk to him all the time.
[172:00.92]Alright.
[172:02.76]Ooh, whoa.
[172:04.70]That's some, like, fucking Doctor Strange shit you're pulling on me.
[172:07.40]Hold on a second.
[172:11.27]So, fold this down.
[172:14.93]And this thing comes up like that.
[172:20.46]Like a little handbag.
[172:21.56]Okay.
[172:26.38]Move the drink.
[172:26.90]No, it's not going to fall.
[172:28.56]I told you, I will delete my $4,000 into your account.
[172:32.68]If that falls.
[172:36.59]If the holes line up, you're good to go.
[172:37.85]They do.
[172:39.47]Stick this UFO into the backpack now.
[172:46.80]What the fuck is this supposed to do?
[172:47.74]Where is this going?
[172:53.36]Stop switching it on me.
[172:57.64]There's a small opening in the inside of the backpack, so put the part with the hole through the opening.
[173:01.03]This is stupid.
[173:08.69]I want you to be able to see inside of my dollhouse.
[173:12.09]Look, there's the bedroom.
[173:13.49]There's the bathroom.
[173:15.68]That's where we have fun.
[173:17.28]That's where we have fun.
[173:25.37]Yes, we do.
[173:29.39]I want everyone on the count of three to say, push it in, son.
[173:33.32]One, two, three.
[173:40.38]I broke it.
[173:41.98]I think I broke it.
[173:44.42]Thanks, Dad.
[173:45.34]I broke it.
[173:46.06]Thanks to you.
[173:47.80]Thanks to you.
[173:52.56]That's good.
[173:57.72]That looks alright.
[173:58.32]Okay, that's sticking out like a little tab.
[174:03.00]You want the top part of the UFO sticking all the way out of the opening?
[174:05.18]Have you got it all the way through?
[174:06.44]Yes, I do, Dad.
[174:07.44]I need to shut the fuck up.
[174:10.88]Alright, where are they?
[174:12.84]Right here.
[174:17.83]Gromit gromit.
[174:18.57]Got it.
[174:23.34]You just shit your pants?
[174:26.08]You probably need to take care of that, dude.
[174:28.94]Or do what I did in kindergarten.
[174:30.38]Sit there and shit your pants in kindergarten.
[174:33.02]And don't do anything.
[174:33.92]Don't tell anybody about it.
[174:35.38]And after about maybe like four to six hours, it'll be like hard.
[174:38.84]Then you can just like break it, like scrape it out in the toilet.
[175:08.28]Hey, you like that funny joke?
[175:13.02]You did this to me!
[175:17.80]Alright, second UFO.
[175:24.83]This and like that.
[175:28.73]You guys are so easy, by the way.
[175:30.85]It's very easy.
[175:33.37]Right?
[175:33.55]Just tell him that.
[175:34.13]Tell him that.
[175:34.53]Make sure they think it was a joke that you made up.
[175:36.61]Just keep telling them that.
[175:37.27]It was so easy to fuck with you guys.
[175:46.61]Go.
[175:47.01]Flip it.
[175:52.33]Nice.
[175:54.70]And then this comes down.
[175:55.74]Stick it like this.
[175:56.46]This is going to the other side.
[175:57.58]I'm assuming it goes on the other side.
[176:03.55]This is like all fucked up though.
[176:04.61]I need to get like a little... Look at that.
[176:07.11]And just like that, I fucking fixed it.
[176:11.20]Play Doom.
[176:18.20]I'll play Doom if I get a million dollars on this stream.
[176:20.66]This one.
[176:22.90]If I make one million dollars on this stream, I'll play Doom like in a year.
[176:32.91]Imagine being that much of an entitled dickhead.
[176:38.60]You guys can't see that.
[176:43.70]That's a bargain.
[176:46.40]Doom's a great game, but I don't wanna play it.
[176:47.93]I have to build this, I've got like four more steps to do, guys.
[176:51.57]Are you serious?
[176:54.85]Cadbtv giving out five community subs.
[176:57.95]Thank you, Cadbtv.
[177:00.32]Oh, you're five community subs.
[177:01.58]There's a million dollars right there.
[177:04.54]It's $250,000.
[177:05.37]It's $200,000 for one gifted sub.
[177:09.39]Fuck, man.
[177:09.77]I gotta play Doom now.
[177:13.25]You got me.
[177:16.23]That's good.
[177:17.23]Right, both sides.
[177:18.01]Both have little ears coming off.
[177:22.31]Rub it.
[177:25.18]Why did that scare me?
[177:26.10]Why am I such a fucking neurotic weirdo?
[177:35.10]Okay, backpack almost done.
[177:41.48]We got him?
[177:41.90]Nobody gets me.
[177:48.68]What's that famous fucking cartoon?
[177:52.66]Fast as you can.
[177:54.18]You can't fucking catch me.
[177:55.16]I'm the goddamn man.
[177:56.58]Made out of ginger.
[177:58.54]Come fuck with me, right?
[177:59.50]That's how it goes?
[178:01.67]Don't drop those.
[178:04.43]Alright, this might be a good time to take a break.
[178:06.21]Nintendo, please stop Wiimoting me right now.
[178:14.86]Sheet eye.
[178:15.54]I gotta move this out of the way.
[178:19.84]I got so many random pieces everywhere.
[178:21.50]I need that one piece from eye.
[178:36.16]I need a maid?
[178:38.34]I clean up after myself.
[178:42.52]You know what I mean?
[178:43.38]I'm not gonna... Plus, I got too much weird shit in here, you know what I mean?
[178:46.44]I want the maid to see that.
[178:47.36]I don't want the maid to come in and see my fucking weird shit.
[179:05.85]Why are you guys calling me a dragon?
[179:12.23]Alright, if I was an animal, what animal do you think I would be?
[179:16.81]Serious answers only.
[179:18.23]A rooster.
[179:24.14]A rat.
[179:25.56]A rat, a rat, a rat.
[179:28.36]You'd be a rat.
[179:29.40]Jeremy, you're a rat.
[179:30.86]You'd be a rat.
[179:32.26]I think you'd be a rat.
[179:34.45]You'd be a rat, a weasel, a rat.
[179:39.14]An ostrich.
[179:40.22]I'm not tall enough to be an ostrich.
[179:42.24]A rat.
[179:42.94]You'd be a horse.
[179:44.52]Ah, I can see that.
[179:46.78]What do you mean, Mike?
[179:50.75]Alright, here we go.
[179:51.33]A princess.
[179:51.73]Fold it.
[179:51.99]A ferret.
[180:04.09]I think I'd be a lion.
[180:11.55]Put it around like this.
[180:18.64]Long strap.
[180:22.76]This one's pretty long.
[180:26.74]I think I'd be a wolf.
[180:29.16]I think so too.
[180:31.66]I would be a wolf-lion hybrid mix.
[180:36.14]King of the jungle, but still social and with it and ferocious.
[180:48.10]Alright, I need the big one.
[180:50.12]You want to pass through this?
[180:51.11]Zigzag, ziggety zags.
[180:52.57]Alright.
[181:05.66]I can't, this doesn't stand like that, man!
[181:10.38]What, in what world am I able to do this with?
[181:12.40]Okay, just through here.
[181:17.65]Don't do it wrong.
[181:19.55]You're the king of the goddamn jungle, for fuck's sake.
[181:21.81]Do you guys think I would be a good lion?
[181:24.91]Or would I be a better goblin?
[181:30.85]Which one of those animals do you think I'd be better as?
[181:32.49]A lion or a goblin?
[181:40.24]I'd be a pretty great goblin, I think.
[181:46.02]No, this is ruined.
[181:47.06]This is actually ruined.
[181:49.60]Pull it out.
[181:55.28]Where's my mane?
[181:56.03]I just cut it off.
[182:00.19]I had a huge, glorious mane.
[182:02.45]Chat made me get rid of it.
[182:04.89]Thanks a lot, Mom and Dad.
[182:07.05]I had cool, long hair.
[182:09.72]Oh, I don't like your hair.
[182:11.00]Okay, thanks, Mom.
[182:12.60]Maybe cut my fucking hair.
[182:22.91]I'm somewhat of a scientist myself.
[182:28.89]It's probably have to be equal.
[182:34.44]Go to your room.
[182:35.76]Tell me what to do.
[182:37.56]Alright, uh, zoop diddly duh.
[182:40.42]Diddly daddly da do pa pa.
[182:42.84]What the fuck was that for?
[182:44.10]Make sure to pull the straps through until there's no slack left.
[182:47.16]Both sides should be about the same length.
[182:48.46]Okay.
[182:53.70]This is not the same length.
[182:55.82]This one's a little too much.
[182:57.28]So let's pull this one out a little bit.
[183:01.70]Is this the same length, Dad?
[183:06.40]Nope.
[183:31.36]Nice and tight.
[183:33.82]Alright, what's next?
[183:36.96]They're not the same length.
[183:37.81]Yes, they are.
[183:38.27]Look.
[183:41.65]Those are the same length.
[183:50.14]Just eyeballed it and got it perfect!
[183:53.68]Mine's longer.
[183:55.44]I don't care how long yours is.
[183:57.86]Don't matter.
[183:58.32]Whoa!
[184:02.23]that this goes through this other side here.
[184:12.37]All the way and tight.
[184:14.65]Yes.
[184:20.40]OK.
[184:21.82]Same thing on the other side.
[184:22.58]I'm going to assume.
[184:23.76]Yeah.
[184:27.72]All that matters is, no.
[184:31.45]Yes, come on.
[184:32.19]You don't really have to tell you all the answers.
[184:34.87]Do you really need all the answers?
[184:37.93]Looks pretty good.
[184:48.32]What's my favorite Iron Wolf name?
[184:50.74]What do you mean, Iron Wolf?
[184:54.02]Wait a minute.
[184:55.44]You need all the answers?
[184:59.57]Hold on, this is coming back.
[185:01.35]Is the strap going through all four ziggy-zaggy openings?
[185:03.45]Then you're ready to go.
[185:04.33]It's not twisted, right?
[185:11.40]No.
[185:13.56]Okay.
[185:13.68]Can you see the tabs and slots?
[185:16.92]So this comes across.
[185:19.76]This.
[185:23.79]Hope I just did that right, otherwise I just broke the whole thing.
[185:30.38]Okay.
[185:31.83]Once you've made that fold, the whole part should stay at the right angle, like the letter L. Does yours match the image on the screen?
[185:42.57]Yeah.
[185:50.98]Now ex, wait a minute.
[185:52.60]Now extend the strap and pass both sides through the two slits in the back of the backpack, time to zoop.
[186:14.15]Okay.
[186:14.29]Is it going the right way?
[186:17.01]I hate this.
[186:34.12]No, I don't.
[186:34.60]This is fun.
[186:41.12]Here we go.
[186:41.56]It looks pretty clean.
[186:43.76]Alright, now give me my instructional manual.
[186:46.35]Okay.
[186:47.87]That goes all the way in until it's... The piece should fit snugly against the inside of the frame.
[186:54.18]Bang, like that.
[186:55.10]Okay.
[187:11.85]we just got this in there look at it just like in the video ready ah that felt really good I just hope I didn't fuck that up somehow it's in there good take a look alright now what there is a furry
[187:41.67]That's not true, but it's fine.
[187:44.35]Okay, I gotta move this out of the way.
[187:45.39]So many straps and pieces.
[187:50.35]Okay.
[187:51.25]Two pieces of sheet J. This is a long piece.
[188:05.52]Okay.
[188:07.60]You want the ones marked with R. So, this is
[188:23.27]The whole thing has to come out?
[188:24.85]Connected?
[188:30.66]Jerma is a forward focus.
[188:32.70]What the hell does that mean?
[188:37.55]I'm a forward focus.
[188:54.28]Oh no, no, no, no, please don't tell me I'm an incredibly affordable, very fast, extremely reliable car that gets an amazing gas mileage and lasts a really long fucking time.
[189:09.99]Oh, no, heaven forbid.
[189:11.63]I don't wanna be like that.
[189:17.23]Oh, like 40 miles per gallon on the highway?
[189:19.30]Oh, that's terrible.
[189:20.56]Fuck, give me a Hummer.
[189:22.72]Give me a Hummer and I'll die at 48 years old.
[189:30.08]Eating fucking cheeseburgers.
[189:38.43]I'm affordable.
[189:39.73]And I'm reliable.
[189:42.99]And I can go a long time.
[189:46.29]Without stopping.
[189:50.21]And I'm full of energy.
[189:52.88]And I'm efficient.
[189:53.52]And I'm smart.
[190:00.32]And I got... I got it all.
[190:06.24]What?
[190:06.48]This is a big piece or a little piece?
[190:07.88]Little piece.
[190:14.96]I ripped it.
[190:15.36]Don't laugh.
[190:17.48]First person that laughs, get him out of here.
[190:18.80]I don't want to see him again.
[190:30.60]I'm not going to see any of these people again.
[190:35.37]Close, close, close.
[190:36.33]That looks good.
[190:36.81]Nice and tight.
[190:39.85]Tight.
[190:47.08]Kind of is.
[190:48.94]But is it?
[190:49.34]Alright.
[190:51.10]Nice and folded.
[190:52.66]What are we doing with this, though?
[190:55.08]Now for the big piece.
[191:01.56]Big money?
[191:02.02]Oh, Jesus.
[191:07.56]Nico, thank you, Nico Ni for the $50.
[191:11.50]$50 from Nico.
[191:15.33]Jerma, thanks for just being you.
[191:17.75]Lots of laughs tonight.
[191:20.47]Hey, thank you, Nico.
[191:25.07]Thank you.
[191:27.29]That's a lot of money to give somebody.
[191:29.41]I'm glad you're having a good time.
[191:34.73]Hope you're having a great time.
[191:38.93]It's all I care about, right?
[191:40.25]It's the only thing I care about.
[191:42.61]Are they having a good time?
[191:45.39]If not, then I'm gonna have to chug on string.
[191:50.30]Way to set yourself up for a fucking disaster, Jeremy.
[191:52.34]You'll be hovering over that toilet very soon.
[191:59.08]Cheese grater.
[192:00.60]Cheese grater on the cheese and make a fucking salad.
[192:04.01]Nah, I don't feel like a salad tonight, no thanks.
[192:05.75]Sorry, guys.
[192:06.09]Alright, so now this has to go this way.
[192:13.78]And these two little things have to come up.
[192:15.64]Is it only those two?
[192:17.64]First, fold this bit here so it makes a little peak.
[192:20.32]The two sides should match perfectly.
[192:22.38]Time for another one of those things.
[192:23.26]Alright, let's get them out now.
[192:29.78]Guys, you're getting that cheese grater on feet joke from the Three Stooges remake.
[192:34.20]You do know that, right?
[192:39.56]I just want to make sure you're aware that's where you're getting that joke from.
[192:41.71]Yeah.
[192:48.79]That happens in the Three Stooges remake.
[192:54.38]The thing you are describing, the joke you are saying, happens in that movie.
[193:02.20]Okay.
[193:03.30]Why do I know this?
[193:04.06]Because I watched that movie on an airplane.
[193:11.14]I didn't want to, it just was available.
[193:12.60]Alright, flip it around.
[193:13.76]Uh, the princess should be face down.
[193:18.23]Okay, now let's start folding this shit.
[193:22.23]Fold, fold, and then across.
[193:23.49]Okay, so fold it up.
[193:27.88]one and then two this whole thing is to go folded it's kind of awkward with the piece being on there but that's fine okay and then the whole thing comes wait what does it do this piece is too long you have to do this on the ground
[194:00.18]You have to actually do this on the ground.
[194:02.16]I'm not doing this right.
[194:07.53]Okay, so now... Up.
[194:16.23]Up.
[194:21.00]And then over.
[194:28.16]The whole way?
[194:30.24]Not the whole way.
[194:31.52]Just like that.
[194:37.13]This, okay.
[194:40.37]Wait a minute.
[194:40.95]Okay, then fold it back from the middle of the gap at the printing.
[194:57.69]Okay, like this.
[195:02.96]Like that, and then this comes up from the edge here.
[195:13.73]Like this.
[195:15.21]What the fuck are you making?
[195:18.49]Then fold this back.
[195:23.69]What the hell?
[195:27.88]Like this.
[195:28.50]Okay.
[195:32.35]Why are you doing this to me?
[195:33.79]Okay.
[195:36.05]Put the two sides up so that they meet in the middle.
[195:44.96]That was very convoluted for what this was.
[195:46.84]Okay.
[195:48.98]Like that.
[195:54.06]Hey, who is this?
[195:54.80]It's the small piece from before.
[195:55.86]Hey little buddy, how you doing?
[195:58.38]Don't treat it like it's an animal.
[196:02.15]Now this, where the hell does this go?
[196:03.35]On top?
[196:08.27]So this goes, Jesus, these need to be lined up much better than this.
[196:17.23]These aren't really matched up that well, hold on.
[196:21.83]How do I zoom in?
[196:23.51]Okay, no, they're not supposed to be.
[196:25.73]Okay, just making sure.
[196:35.80]I guess through here.
[196:40.95]R and R. Wait, is that R?
[196:43.23]That's R right there.
[196:44.25]Line it up.
[196:44.89]Stick it through.
[196:45.55]This wraps okay.
[196:50.15]Turn it around.
[196:51.93]Fold it around and snap it in.
[197:01.84]Doom!
[197:03.64]You ain't getting doomed.
[197:07.29]Like that.
[197:10.49]You know, you've been trained your entire life at this moment.
[197:13.99]I mean, not really, but I guess whatever.
[197:16.49]The right shoulder strap is complete.
[197:21.19]For the finishing touch, you'll need to give it a bit of curve.
[197:23.28]A good bend will make it fit your shoulders.
[197:25.20]Alright, this is like a fitted hat.
[197:31.30]You gotta be careful.
[197:32.97]Too much and you'll look like an idiot.
[197:49.89]That looks alright.
[197:57.23]Left side, same thing.
[198:01.98]I did not ruin it.
[198:05.88]We need from Jay.
[198:09.14]Same deal except the other side.
[198:14.60]Same thing again.
[198:15.24]This one will be done after this.
[198:19.35]Play Quake.
[198:20.39]I'm not going to play Quake.
[198:25.55]I'm not playing Quake.
[198:26.73]I'm not playing Doom.
[198:27.69]I'm not playing Unreal Tournament 2003.
[198:29.15]I'm not going to do it.
[198:34.67]I'm not going to do it.
[198:35.97]I'm not going to do it.
[198:36.85]I'm not going to do it.
[198:40.06]I'm the Tooth Fairy?
[198:40.82]You did a pretty cool job.
[198:46.00]Probably pays pretty well.
[198:47.90]One's done, and so is this one.
[198:50.58]Yes.
[198:54.14]Oh, I just, that fucking whacked the mic.
[199:02.60]Say ye, I'm not going to say that.
[199:06.21]Find somebody else that'll say that for you.
[199:08.65]I'll spell it for you, though.
[199:10.95]Y-E, and then another letter, and then the one that looks like this.
[199:15.89]I'm not going to say it.
[199:36.27]Okay, I just kind of blacked out for a second.
[199:41.37]I had a micro blackout.
[199:46.50]What did you want me to say?
[199:47.18]Oh, okay.
[200:00.17]Still no, still no.
[200:01.99]Okay, let's go.
[200:02.77]Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it.
[200:13.19]What's with this trend of, like, try to get guy online to say thing?
[200:19.05]What is with that?
[200:19.63]I don't understand.
[200:21.81]I've got an idea.
[200:22.79]Try to get guy online to say thing.
[200:27.77]No.
[200:27.89]Alright, that's done.
[200:31.26]We've got the same thing with this.
[200:33.70]It's the left side, though, so it has to be on the left side.
[200:36.02]This is your left, if you want.
[200:37.16]Sure.
[200:37.36]Like this, a little steeple.
[200:41.92]We need a couple of grommets.
[200:43.85]Mm-hmm, there's only one left.
[200:45.75]This bag is now empty.
[200:46.77]Okay, skip, skip, skip.
[200:51.28]I know what to do here.
[200:51.96]Gromit.
[200:55.16]It's cracking toast, Gromit.
[200:59.94]Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.
[201:03.37]Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.
[201:05.17]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[201:08.25]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[201:15.06]What's the name of my friend's fursona?
[201:21.91]Allure.
[201:23.13]A-L-L-U-R-I-I-E.
[201:27.57]Allure.
[201:29.29]That's not trash.
[201:29.93]That is.
[201:34.43]Flip it around.
[201:35.23]Same deal.
[201:36.29]We're going up.
[201:46.55]Okay, something like this.
[201:51.09]This other shoulder strap.
[201:56.01]Then up, up and over.
[201:59.19]That's nice and tight, nice and taut.
[202:03.53]Up and over.
[202:06.83]This.
[202:10.03]Don't pull this apart, I almost ripped it in half.
[202:13.91]Nice and taut, yes, it needs to be taut because then how are you gonna get it on your back?
[202:18.75]My hair is just sweating.
[202:22.25]Do you guys mind if I turn the fan on?
[202:24.73]Is this too much for you guys?
[202:29.85]That's okay, right?
[202:30.41]Do you mind if I turn the fan on?
[202:36.92]Okay.
[202:37.20]It's a little smoky in here.
[202:40.14]Well, it's too light, I don't care.
[202:45.28]Is it actually too loud?
[202:47.48]Like non-joke, is it actually loud?
[202:52.68]The first guy said no, so that's fine, I'm staying on.
[202:54.82]Alright, so, it's a cross, and then we gotta fold this shit back on its axis like this.
[203:03.58]Oh, it hurts, because it's painful to look at it.
[203:07.07]And this one comes up.
[203:11.47]Fold it up like that, and then backwards, right?
[203:19.30]Like this, and then they both come up into the middle like that.
[203:24.23]Okay, look at that.
[203:25.53]Happy fucking family.
[203:36.09]This is concerning me because these holes aren't going anywhere.
[203:38.15]Oh well, whatever.
[203:46.33]I'm sure I'll figure it out.
[203:47.96]Alright, match up the L.
[203:52.34]That's not matching it up.
[203:53.34]Now it is.
[203:54.72]Stick it on and then tie it around the back.
[203:59.12]Flip it.
[204:00.10]Nice work, Jeremy.
[204:00.92]You're doing a great job.
[204:03.99]You're actually doing a great fucking job.
[204:06.79]Somebody in chat wants to say, holy shit, dude, you're a fucking idiot.
[204:10.09]Don't listen to him.
[204:10.95]Don't listen.
[204:11.41]You're doing a great job.
[204:24.41]Hey, good for you.
[204:24.83]Thanks, man.
[204:28.27]Finally bend the strap a little just to have a little bit more way here.
[204:31.49]Okay.
[204:45.66]Alright.
[204:47.24]Straps are done.
[204:50.24]How is this a robot?
[204:54.35]I honestly don't get that.
[204:56.93]I'm just making like a fucking shitty Ghostbusters proton pack.
[205:01.01]I'm not making a robot.
[205:02.49]That one's done.
[205:03.01]Are we done with these now, the scraps?
[205:12.98]It's a backpack, you moron.
[205:14.52]Now, I know it's a backpack, but why would a backpack be a robot?
[205:22.59]I know what it is.
[205:23.29]I know what the fuck I'm making.
[205:24.55]I just don't... How is this a robot?
[205:27.44]Don't be so mean.
[205:42.19]Wait, I don't... Make sure I'm pulling it the right way.
[205:47.41]Why are you making it?
[205:49.74]Because I have buyer's remorse and it was $80 and I have to get some money out of it, right?
[205:53.96]I have to get like my money's worth.
[205:56.56]So if I pay $80 for that, I got to get my like money's worth by making it.
[206:02.67]And I'm not going to make it by myself because what a fucking waste that would be.
[206:06.79]I want to play it with you guys.
[206:08.68]So it's buyer's remorse.
[206:11.26]I have to do this.
[206:18.25]You got $200 today already?
[206:20.08]No, I'm not talking about like making money from the stream.
[206:22.42]I'm saying that like, I have to play this.
[206:24.44]I have to use this.
[206:25.88]And I'm not gonna sit in my fucking man cave down here, silent, fucking making cardboard houses.
[206:39.74]In my mansion?
[206:43.68]This room is like 14 by five.
[206:52.94]There's a bathroom right there, and there's a goddamn couch over there.
[206:56.41]I sleep on the ground right here.
[207:03.19]I take all these cardboard scraps and I lie on the ground.
[207:08.41]Alright, so now this is gonna go, get the straps go through here.
[207:12.59]Yeah, I gotta play it.
[207:15.19]People are like, oh, why don't you just not play it?
[207:16.85]Just delete it.
[207:18.45]No, dude, I gotta get my money's worth.
[207:21.94]I paid 80 bucks for this.
[207:23.18]I have to get my money's worth.
[207:26.47]It's like when I go to a movie, right?
[207:29.21]You sit, you pay the 15, 20 goddamn dollars it is for a movie ticket these days.
[207:33.99]Okay.
[207:34.81]You go to the theater.
[207:36.05]I don't walk out of the movie.
[207:37.43]I don't.
[207:37.75]I don't care how bad the movie is.
[207:38.67]I'm going to get my money's worth.
[207:40.07]So that means like you see five or six people get up and leave because they hate the movie.
[207:44.33]I'm not leaving.
[207:45.27]I'm getting my money's worth.
[207:47.83]Why would you leave the movie theater?
[207:49.21]You already paid the money.
[207:52.21]You're describing sunk cost fallacy.
[207:55.35]That's fine, you can fallacy all you want.
[207:57.44]That don't matter.
[208:01.68]Does this fold and go all the way through?
[208:08.84]It does have to go, okay, so fold it down.
[208:10.74]Through.
[208:13.92]Like that, okay.
[208:22.73]Why wouldn't they put the other one in?
[208:34.50]Sunk cost fallacy.
[208:37.40]No, but this is fun.
[208:39.04]I like this.
[208:42.93]I'm not having a bad time.
[208:43.93]I'm having a good time.
[208:45.33]But still, the point still stands.
[208:51.12]worth man I'm just gonna let this rot in the closet it can rot in a landfill after like tonight I care well I'm gonna recycle look wait I'm going to recycle all this shit I've been saving these cardboard pieces
[209:26.44]They're all going into recycling.
[209:29.72]That fucking piano's not coming with me to Vegas.
[209:34.00]You want me to pack up the piano and bring it with me to Las Vegas?
[209:38.33]No.
[209:39.95]That shit's going into the goddamn recycling bin.
[209:44.93]Yes, no, it's not coming with me.
[209:50.21]Stick the left one in there.
[209:56.03]You're unsubbing if the piano isn't in Vegas.
[209:57.73]What if I got a real piano?
[209:58.95]Would that make you feel better?
[209:59.91]What if I bought a real grand piano?
[210:10.76]Yes.
[210:16.54]Oh, come on, you little shit.
[210:17.66]Okay, there we go.
[210:19.94]That's through.
[210:23.54]Give the shoulder straps one more bend.
[210:25.13]Try to get them the same shape as you see on the screen.
[210:34.15]Pretty accurate, I think.
[210:34.95]Alright, let's go.
[210:38.77]Wait, this is all alcohol in here.
[210:40.27]Oh, well.
[210:44.89]Woo!
[210:45.11]Okay, now we'll pass the fabric strap through our shoulder straps.
[210:54.26]Now get it twisted.
[210:56.06]Hold on a second.
[210:56.80]Jesus Christ.
[211:01.00]So this has to go... What kind of Willy Wonka shit are you pulling on me here, game?
[211:07.14]Hold on.
[211:20.17]I have to see it from this angle.
[211:21.43]I'm sorry, guys.
[211:22.83]You don't get to see it.
[211:31.45]So it comes across like this, and then in.
[211:39.24]Top slot.
[211:44.38]Oh my fucking lord.
[211:45.72]You gotta be kidding me, dude.
[211:54.45]This is so difficult to pull this through here.
[212:00.72]The wedge is all fucked up.
[212:02.18]How are you supposed to do this shit reliably?
[212:12.13]Alright, I got it.
[212:12.69]So that goes in all the way.
[212:16.73]Alright, like that, okay.
[212:26.62]Careful, Gerber, careful.
[212:27.50]I'm fine, I'm good.
[212:29.54]And then it goes all the way out, and then all the way in to the other side, and then around.
[212:42.53]How do they expect kids to do this?
[212:45.73]A grown man can't even figure this out.
[212:47.15]I mean, he was here earlier.
[212:50.43]I don't know where he went, but I would love to have that guy here.
[212:54.60]He couldn't figure it out, though.
[212:55.50]He was like, I don't fucking understand this shit.
[212:58.59]I was like, really?
[212:59.07]I need help, man.
[212:59.81]Because they don't match up, these things.
[213:11.36]I got a defect.
[213:13.22]This shit doesn't match up correctly.
[213:15.40]Nintendo got me a defect.
[213:26.58]I need like a pair of tweezers to get this through.
[213:28.54]Got it.
[213:35.73]Straighten the strap first.
[213:36.85]I got it.
[213:37.23]I'm fine.
[213:37.71]I got it.
[213:38.05]Look.
[213:47.46]What am I going to play?
[213:48.10]You're not going to play Doom music.
[213:58.79]I thought it fell down.
[213:59.65]I was about to say, oh shit.
[214:03.29]Okay, the whole thing comes down like this, tight.
[214:07.82]And then this way.
[214:13.64]You should leave about as much fabric strap free between the backpack and the shoulder strap as you see on the screen.
[214:19.21]I need more.
[214:29.15]That looks like enough space in there.
[214:35.45]Same thing on the other side.
[214:40.49]Glue Man for Smash.
[214:43.28]Wouldn't that be the day?
[214:44.06]Okay, same thing.
[214:48.22]Make sure it's out nice and straight.
[214:52.30]And then this comes in through here.
[214:55.99]Right?
[214:57.45]Straight out.
[214:58.46]And then wrap around like this.
[215:03.91]Like that.
[215:05.09]And then this way, right?
[215:07.19]Show it to me.
[215:09.47]Yeah.
[215:19.98]Pain in the ass.
[215:26.42]Then it goes in.
[215:33.54]Through here, correct.
[215:39.66]You know, I'm gonna give this like a kid.
[215:42.17]Be like, hey kid, do you want a funny little backpack?
[215:46.47]Yeah, okay.
[215:51.59]Can your mom give me 80 bucks?
[215:53.23]Alright, that's good.
[216:00.42]Yeah, I didn't say that.
[216:07.55]I'll put words in my mouth.
[216:08.66]Okay, that's good.
[216:10.24]They're now attached.
[216:10.98]We'll need to check the shoulder straps.
[216:12.14]Don't put the backpack on yet, please.
[216:17.90]I won't put it on.
[216:22.33]Backpack is complete.
[216:25.23]It's a cardboard gaming contraption.
[216:29.45]You passed the hurdle with flying colors.
[216:30.97]Now's a good time to relax.
[216:32.07]I don't got time to relax, man.
[216:36.16]Alright, we're halfway there.
[216:37.14]What's it been?
[216:37.62]Four hours?
[216:38.16]It's been like another three hours.
[216:41.32]No, we're not gonna take that.
[216:42.48]We'll make the slider box.
[216:43.61]Get this thing out of my fucking face.
[216:51.59]Alright, L and M. This is B. G. Not B. Not A.
[217:07.99]L and M. There actually aren't that many very many things in here left.
[217:14.95]There's only like two or three of these left.
[217:17.85]So I feel like the last few pieces are actually going to be pretty quick.
[217:22.15]So L and M. Take them both out.
[217:26.32]Big one.
[217:31.30]Jesus Christ.
[217:33.18]Jesus fucking Christ.
[217:59.02]There you go.
[218:00.28]It's your Doom soundtrack.
[218:06.43]Only the, only pieces.
[218:11.67]And then, those sunglasses?
[218:14.85]What the hell?
[218:21.04]For now, these two pieces.
[218:26.86]You fold like a lawn chair to chat's demands.
[218:41.86]I'm turning it down though.
[218:42.95]It's too loud.
[218:44.17]It's a little too loud for you.
[218:45.03]It's late.
[218:45.39]It's like 10 o'clock.
[218:47.99]Main part of the slider box is important, but he's a robot properly.
[218:56.62]Louder.
[218:58.58]No, it's not gonna be louder.
[218:59.74]I'm sorry guys, I'm not gonna wake the neighbors.
[219:04.16]Is that fucking Doom music?
[219:06.26]What's happening?
[219:13.52]Alright, ah, printed side facing down.
[219:16.10]Yep, of course.
[219:18.20]Just fold it, fold it.
[219:21.98]Nice and easy.
[219:27.61]I want these easy pieces.
[219:28.79]They make me so heavy.
[219:32.97]This one's only got like two pieces.
[219:34.31]Look at how easy this one is.
[219:35.31]It'll be done in fucking 20 minutes.
[219:37.25]Count it.
[219:42.19]Turn the stream off at the shotgun blast at the end.
[219:47.56]No, that's fine.
[219:48.62]I'll turn the damn stream off.
[219:50.70]Alright, turn it like this.
[219:57.38]You can't hear it.
[219:59.02]I don't want it to be that loud.
[220:00.25]Look, focus on me folding the shit on screen, okay?
[220:03.83]Watch.
[220:05.21]Hey.
[220:09.59]Hey.
[220:10.11]I'm not going to turn it off.
[220:19.34]Lift it up.
[220:20.28]Okay.
[220:25.18]Right in.
[220:27.40]Very nice.
[220:29.84]Stuck.
[220:30.98]And wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[220:31.96]Make sure these are, do these need to be in or out, or in or out?
[220:35.92]Why didn't you tell me to get these?
[220:39.73]We need K. K. K. K. We need one piece for K.
[220:59.79]That's it, we can trash that one.
[221:01.37]Alright, I'm turning off the Doom soundtrack now.
[221:05.09]Very loud, three, two, one, very loud.
[221:06.81]Be ready, three, two, one, very loud.
[221:10.84]Okay, that was fun.
[221:16.60]Let's go back to the shitty Switch music.
[221:29.31]No, no, no.
[221:30.41]You got what you wanted, and that's what you get.
[221:32.23]You got what you wanted.
[221:34.52]You got what you wanted.
[221:41.42]Yes, you did.
[221:41.96]You got what you wanted.
[221:42.54]You got three and a half minutes of the Doom soundtrack.
[221:46.08]Nobody said a certain amount of time for the Doom soundtrack.
[221:48.31]They just said put it on.
[221:51.43]There wasn't a time.
[221:52.31]Same thing with this one.
[221:57.59]It's going to go on the other side.
[221:59.80]Very cool.
[222:00.79]Very neat.
[222:13.60]I only heard it for the last five seconds.
[222:15.00]I'm sorry that you missed it.
[222:17.14]But we played it for a long time.
[222:19.66]Three minutes is like six weeks on the internet.
[222:23.82]Oops-a-daisy.
[222:24.58]Just broke it.
[222:25.33]Fix it.
[222:36.36]This is snapped in, right?
[222:37.99]Yeah.
[222:42.01]Alright, so now this folds in.
[222:45.31]Put on the Halo OST.
[222:50.25]I don't think I will.
[222:51.23]I'm not putting on the Halo OST.
[222:59.57]That looks good.
[223:03.63]Snapped in.
[223:05.20]Flip the whole thing around, which will get us this looking thing.
[223:13.06]Drink almost went down.
[223:15.11]It won't.
[223:15.47]Okay.
[223:23.81]Rat Movie OST, there's one song.
[223:36.77]Pull this in.
[223:38.99]Oh, that one's hard.
[223:43.73]No, we're not putting on OSTs.
[223:47.11]I'm sorry, guys.
[223:47.97]You gotta deal with the Nintendo Switch.
[223:55.38]Until the day we all go under.
[223:58.04]This is the song that's gonna be played on every single stream.
[224:07.28]So this tab goes down here.
[224:08.84]And then this sits, sticks into R, R, R. R, R, R, look at that little grill.
[224:20.73]Little grill goes here.
[224:21.97]In.
[224:22.03]And then L, L, L. L, L.
[224:37.77]Look at that.
[224:39.09]I miss old Jerma, aka Jax, who wouldn't care about the neighbors.
[224:53.61]N. Bring out N. N. Come on now, the whole thing.
[225:05.00]Just because I say it doesn't mean you have to say it too.
[225:10.81]Fine, you wanna play that game?
[225:12.59]This is the best stream I've ever been to.
[225:14.14]I see you that moving, I raise you a fucking dollar.
[225:43.27]N is done.
[225:44.03]Nothing else in here.
[225:48.97]So what the hell happens with these two chunks?
[225:53.20]They'll form the rails inside.
[225:54.74]What do you mean the rails?
[225:58.26]Crease the folds on both sides.
[226:01.60]Both sides, that's it.
[226:04.50]And these are okay.
[226:06.09]Hold on.
[226:06.65]You got the baby toy here.
[226:13.00]Square goes into square, circle goes into circle.
[226:17.60]That sounded like a crunch that I didn't like.
[226:19.38]Okay, so that's that, like this.
[226:21.58]This side has to go in here.
[226:28.32]Look at the little punch hand.
[226:29.46]Look at the little hand, it's a little like got ya.
[226:37.33]Bring back Jex.
[226:40.49]He's still around.
[226:42.37]You don't think he's still around from time to time.
[226:44.19]Alright, so L goes into L. Now take the rail with the L foot mark and slide it where you see the L mark on the slider box to slide the pieces so the marks match.
[226:57.20]So this L, L, that goes in here.
[227:00.64]Alright, does it slide all the way in?
[227:08.75]Slides all the way in.
[227:20.40]Hit it!
[227:20.66]Okay, next up, the rail marked with the L of the fist.
[227:29.88]The navy blue there, line it up with this one.
[227:32.76]It goes in the second rail.
[227:33.72]Howdy neighbor, mind if I squeeze in here?
[227:35.66]Snap it in.
[227:52.23]That's in?
[227:55.11]Oh my god, I missed... I missed the old Jerma jacks who wouldn't care about neighbors and played the Doom soundtrack as loud as he wanted.
[228:07.66]Now he's turned into a living embodiment of his grandpa character, sitting in his man cave, playing with arts and crafts.
[228:48.51]Call me an old man ever again.
[229:05.75]Oh!
[229:17.03]You don't care about what I'm saying now.
[229:18.31]Just listen to the music.
[229:33.82]Jeremiah, I care about you.
[229:35.81]Thanks.
[229:36.15]I care about you.
[229:37.45]Thank you.
[229:53.07]This is the song?
[230:00.92]This doesn't fit at all.
[231:47.16]Get the fuck in there.
[231:49.84]It's gotta be refolded.
[232:02.35]Got it.
[232:02.81]Okay, it's in.
[232:04.65]It's in and it's in the correct spot.
[232:06.03]Same thing with R. That's enough Doom music for you, Jerma.
[232:18.28]No, you guys asked for this, it's staying.
[232:29.42]We're good, it's all in.
[232:34.46]R to R, R to R, the slider box is completed!
[233:18.05]This is yoga's famous slider box combination pose.
[233:47.33]What do you want me to do?
[233:47.93]Like, I can't set it on the ground, dude.
[233:50.94]Whatever, I'm gonna hold it.
[233:56.96]Slide the slider box into the backpack.
[234:03.22]Start with the tab and keep it level.
[234:30.04]Where does it go?
[234:31.88]What side does it go?
[234:39.82]It goes in the bottom.
[234:41.36]What the fuck are you talking about?
[234:51.97]Give me two people!
[235:55.67]Mr. Stickler.
[236:04.84]Okay.
[236:06.78]Fold it in half like this.
[236:11.76]I miss the old Jerma that could sit down quietly with a cup of Dr. Pepper and play sorcery.
[236:15.87]Instead we have the living embodiment of Jack sitting downstairs playing with overpriced tech scolding his viewers.
[236:24.10]Sitting in his man cave playing with ants and crafts... Quietly... Where does this go?
[236:45.47]Mr. Stickler goes in from above, right into the opening of the tab you just folded.
[236:48.93]Sticking it there is Mr. Stickler's job.
[236:51.62]That's right, kids.
[236:52.42]I'm a real stickler for keeping parts in place.
[236:54.90]Ready, set, stick.
[236:58.85]It goes in here, right in this little spot there.
[237:03.91]Mr. Stickler, kids.
[237:26.72]Come on, kids.
[237:28.66]Come on, kids.
[237:30.94]Come on, kids.
[237:32.93]Come on, kids.
[237:34.91]Dad doesn't want to fuck around anymore.
[237:36.41]Come on.
[237:38.59]Dad's done fucking around.
[237:39.69]Come on, kids.
[237:41.57]Get in there.
[237:42.03]There we go, kids.
[237:43.93]There we go, kids.
[237:46.06]Dad's got it.
[237:47.96]Dad's still fucking got it.
[237:53.00]That's the fourth time I've dropped the Wiimote.
[237:54.90]I just ran it over the chair.
[237:57.64]These things are durable, who gives a fuck?
[237:58.86]Alright.
[238:00.28]Slider box in the backpack, and now the slider box is in the backpack.
[238:04.08]Next, we'll fold up the outside of the backpack.
[238:07.49]Folding all the panels on the bottom of the backpack with the fold lines in place should be easy.
[238:22.21]Some, like, Pinterest mom does this shit for her kids and makes them a fucking cardboard backpack from scratch.
[238:34.84]Dude, break.
[238:36.14]Alright.
[238:37.56]Then this folds down and in.
[238:46.55]Like that.
[238:47.63]Same thing with this one.
[238:57.23]In.
[238:57.73]Okay.
[238:58.33]That's in.
[238:59.53]Secure.
[238:59.99]There we go.
[239:05.89]Now that the two double locks are in place, let's set the backpack up again.
[239:08.65]This.
[239:16.21]Please direct your attention to the right.
[239:18.93]We want to fold in these tabs.
[239:24.67]It's too big.
[239:25.21]You guys can't even see this shit.
[239:28.31]Fold in these tabs.
[239:29.59]I just knocked it out of place.
[239:30.73]Fuck you.
[239:31.55]Okay.
[239:35.87]These tabs come in.
[239:41.28]A bunch of money just came in, too.
[239:42.48]Hold on.
[239:44.14]And then fold the whole panel down.
[239:45.54]It might be tricky, but this tab needs to come down on the outside of the slider box.
[239:50.40]If the tab doesn't seem to want to go there and keeps getting inside the box, try pushing the slider box down some more.
[239:57.19]So that tap has to go in.
[239:58.33]Like this.
[240:03.78]Wait, what does this fucking thing have to do?
[240:05.74]This has to come down.
[240:06.56]This comes in like that.
[240:10.22]Okay, I got it, I got it.
[240:12.75]I didn't have any trouble with that at all.
[240:17.01]Same thing on the other side.
[240:18.65]Same thing.
[240:20.13]Watch out for the slider box.
[240:23.76]Same thing, stick it in.
[240:27.93]Alright, that's in.
[240:28.97]That looks great, by the way.
[240:30.35]Oh.
[240:31.39]I love the Jerm of the wholesome, sweet, folding cardboard chatting with his viewers.
[240:37.98]Not like the old Jerm, which was growing and didn't quite interact as much with chat.
[240:57.36]It's done.
[241:00.77]Goes into the slider box on the second rail from the right.
[241:54.07]Fucking neighbors.
[241:56.11]Alright, second one from the right.
[242:00.11]One, two.
[242:04.88]How far does it go in?
[242:11.12]The marker stickers need to be faced outwards so that they're visible.
[242:13.80]This is ultra super mega important.
[242:19.16]Lower it gently.
[242:27.15]Has the power piston reached the bottom?
[242:31.11]Yes.
[242:34.79]Now what?
[242:37.35]The second power piston with the orange string goes in the second rail from the left.
[242:41.90]Well, I gotta get this out of my fucking way.
[242:44.02]Okay.
[242:48.94]So right there, two in the middle.
[242:51.79]Okay, down it goes.
[242:58.78]Piston has reached his destination.
[242:59.84]Play nice with your neighbor, little piston.
[243:02.88]Yeah, that's in there.
[243:04.48]Okay.
[243:09.35]Chat, don't do this again.
[243:11.09]I don't know what's so fucking funny about watching a man building cardboard lab with the loudest heavy metal music in the background.
[243:18.13]I miss the old Jerma who thought a nice peaceful time hanging out with viewers was answering questions while streaming.
[243:22.52]While taking a shit.
[243:33.57]You guys are fucking crazy.
[243:43.02]Alright, let's finish this goddamn thing.
[243:48.12]Two more to go.
[243:53.16]Bing bing.
[243:58.11]This one goes in the right, all the way down.
[244:04.29]on the bottom good same thing on the other side alright now what do I do with these extra strings yeah all the way to the left next stop is your new home the end of the line welcome to the university of l all the power pistons have arrived this concludes the great power piston migration please hold your applause
[244:39.06]Now, just to make sure and extra sure, can you see the marker sticker on every power piston?
[244:43.18]If some aren't visible, try redoing them.
[244:45.86]I can see them.
[244:47.74]One, two, three, four, I can see them.
[244:52.70]The power pistons are all set.
[244:55.22]We're almost done with the video game.
[244:56.98]The next step will be thread the pieces of spring attached to the four power pistons through.
[245:03.68]This orange string should go through the eyelet that's just, hold on.
[245:09.66]This orange string should go through the eyelet that's just behind it.
[245:12.24]Double check with the screen and feed it through.
[245:14.08]Why doesn't it want me to go?
[245:19.23]Okay, so right through this one.
[245:27.63]Feed it through.
[245:28.21]Okay, that's fed through.
[245:33.69]Cheese grater on a feeder.
[245:34.71]Riot.
[245:35.39]You guys are going to have to riot.
[245:36.37]Oh, that goes through.
[245:36.98]Ah!
[245:40.52]That goes through, past the string through the eyelet on the R shoulder strap.
[245:51.61]I fucked it up a little.
[245:56.55]Okay, that's through.
[245:59.77]Now where do you want me to go with this?
[246:01.69]Finally give the string a slow steady pull to take in any slack.
[246:05.85]There is no slack here.
[246:08.70]Now that the string is passing through the two eyelets, let's turn the backpack around to side.
[246:13.88]I'm going to piss my pants.
[246:17.09]I'll be right back.
[248:56.64]That's the call of me Okay, what the fuck am I doing now that the To the back back to the side with a slider box again next let's take care of the other orange that's recessive on somebody Something simple, okay
[249:32.61]Like that?
[249:36.33]No, not on the drink.
[249:38.29]You ruined it all.
[249:41.89]What's going on with my mic?
[249:45.46]Check the window.
[249:48.48]There ain't anybody there.
[249:50.10]OK, good one.
[249:54.88]This one's going through the other side, OK?
[250:00.68]Through the left backpack.
[250:05.04]Oh, hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.
[250:08.14]No slack, right?
[250:10.46]Good.
[250:12.84]Okay.
[250:14.37]These other two strings are a bit more complicated, but don't worry.
[250:18.15]Just look at the screen carefully and you'll be fine.
[250:19.91]Not right now.
[250:20.65]I've had a couple of drinks.
[250:22.45]How could I ever be able to do it?
[250:24.03]Okay, flip, flip, flip, flip.
[250:29.43]Let's get through here.
[250:30.45]I'm just going to be putting the fucked up backpack.
[250:45.16]What are you doing?
[250:48.56]It's through.
[250:50.28]Once it's through, let's look at the other side.
[250:57.33]Once the string passes through the side, it needs to go through the eyelet right next to it.
[251:02.98]So it goes back through here.
[251:06.10]Okay.
[251:07.68]This goes into the hole here.
[251:10.06]And then where does it go from here?
[251:12.70]Down.
[251:13.26]Whoa!
[251:14.09]Now you're blowing my mind.
[251:17.53]So this goes through here.
[251:23.07]All the way to the side of the backpack.
[251:25.29]Now from here, pull the string straight down and pass it through the eyelet that sticks out from the other side of the backpack.
[251:34.39]Look at that.
[251:40.45]Same thing with the other one, okay.
[251:42.83]Okay, so this goes in here and then around and then through, of course, it's in here
[252:00.01]This is so elaborate for, like, just actually not being useful for anything else.
[252:05.90]Like, if I could play this, if I could use this on, like, Metroid or something, maybe.
[252:11.78]But holy shit, what a waste of fucking time.
[252:14.50]Like, let's be real.
[252:16.04]Like, what the fuck am I gonna do with this thing?
[252:19.20]It's just useless.
[252:22.72]You know, I guess it's the journey, right?
[252:25.90]It's the journey we went on together.
[252:33.77]right correct straight through to back to here okay one last pull of a good measure that's pretty snug did all four of the strings pass through their eyelids yeah yeah they did check the front yeah I got it it's time to close the lid on the backpack first fold this panel down
[252:59.26]on top of the slider box.
[253:02.66]This one, fold it down.
[253:09.40]Okay.
[253:11.48]Now what?
[253:12.92]Fold open the two tabs on the sides of the backpack, a boop on the right and a boop on the left.
[253:18.92]These things, yeah.
[253:21.66]They're open.
[253:24.68]Next, let's fold down the tabs on the lid, a boop on the right and a boop on the left.
[253:29.83]And the whole thing comes down.
[253:35.41]So this folds like this.
[253:37.79]This folds like this.
[253:41.92]And then the whole thing comes down.
[253:46.62]What's this fucking camera angle?
[253:52.59]All the way down, it snaps in.
[254:00.97]Don't embarrass me in front of my fucking friends.
[254:03.43]It's in.
[254:11.08]Got it.
[254:16.76]I feel like I'm doing somebody's hair, okay.
[254:18.36]This backpack tab goes into the opening, yes it does.
[254:28.48]All four strings coming off the backpack, another big step forward.
[254:35.11]Now let's just check quickly that the power pist... Yeah, they're working.
[254:38.17]We'll start with the shoulder strap.
[254:41.81]This is a fucking PhD, man.
[254:43.47]I swear to God.
[254:47.65]Try pulling on the two orange strings of the middle two power pistons moving up and down.
[255:08.73]Okay.
[255:10.25]Very nice.
[255:13.37]Try pulling the two light blue strings.
[255:20.41]Do the power pistons move?
[255:25.32]They do.
[255:26.64]They're moving.
[255:33.32]Whoa, this is scientific, isn't it?
[255:36.17]Look at that.
[255:36.53]We're done.
[255:39.69]Getting close.
[255:42.62]Sure?
[255:43.30]No?
[255:44.38]I mean, no.
[255:46.14]What is this for?
[255:46.90]I can't... I don't have an answer for it.
[255:58.89]It's certainly mechanical.
[255:59.87]An unsung hero hidden in plain sight.
[256:04.89]Time for a breather.
[256:05.79]A well rested mind lets you enjoy the work.
[256:10.48]Go back to work is what Nintendo is telling me.
[256:12.30]Okay, fine.
[256:15.46]I'm gonna make robot arms now.
[256:18.82]Okay, I gotta get this out of the way.
[256:20.90]This thing's fucking heavy.
[256:23.34]It's an actual giant box.
[256:26.97]Okay, that's done.
[256:28.99]Now I need pee.
[256:34.79]Look at all these folds.
[256:36.23]Whoa.
[256:38.13]That's too many.
[256:39.61]Wait, what happened to the camera?
[256:43.99]The camera like got all, oh, it's because I moved it, you dummy.
[256:56.85]Whoa.
[257:03.43]I want you guys to be able to see this shit, right?
[257:05.83]It's a little too dark.
[257:09.73]There I go.
[257:10.59]There I go.
[257:12.38]Okay.
[257:16.26]Too many folds on this when I give up.
[257:18.76]See you guys on fucking Tuesday.
[257:21.42]Today's Sunday, right?
[257:22.34]Happy Sunday.
[257:24.24]You guys are relaxing on your Sunday night.
[257:28.21]Having a drink or two, maybe?
[257:29.97]Just relax a little.
[257:30.89]No big deal.
[257:40.98]Saturday.
[257:45.36]We've got a good Saturday.
[257:46.44]You know, it's the day of rest, as they say.
[257:48.35]The day of our Lord.
[257:50.45]Saturday.
[257:51.09]You know, like the Jesus Christ of Saturday saints, right?
[257:56.47]Saturday.
[257:56.89]I just made a hole in the wall.
[258:03.60]No, I've got to get that.
[258:04.18]I've got to go.
[258:09.26]Middle of this month.
[258:18.29]I'm not gonna get out of here.
[258:18.94]There's so many little holes here along the edge.
[258:22.82]Fuck that.
[258:24.28]I'll do it with my fingernail, I think.
[258:27.20]You know, let's put them in the drink too.
[258:28.64]Fuck it.
[258:29.44]I'll drink these.
[258:42.53]Quick, we're pulling this off!
[258:52.55]We're good.
[259:11.02]This guy's fucked.
[259:16.46]I'll get you in the face.
[259:19.56]I'm gonna get you in the fucking mouth, I swear to God.
[259:48.06]about it.
[259:49.22]I was thinking about it.
[259:54.36]I just fucking missed.
[259:57.24]Alright, are we good?
[259:58.41]Are we good?
[260:04.87]Yep.
[260:05.13]Printed side facing down.
[260:06.25]They're both the same, so who gives a shit?
[260:10.21]What, you asking what this is?
[260:11.25]It's a goddamn down east.
[260:15.80]It's the best cider you can possibly buy.
[260:18.60]This is by far the best alcoholic cider you can possibly purchase.
[260:25.76]Nobody's paying me to say that, I just am.
[260:38.49]Oh no, oh no, don't do that, what are you thinking?
[260:42.13]Holy shit, dude, why would you do something like that?
[260:44.61]Are you insane?
[260:48.64]Don't do it!
[260:49.26]Don't do it!
[260:49.94]Don't do it!
[261:04.04]Get fucked.
[261:22.78]Jerma is such a ham.
[261:26.60]How is it possible?
[261:27.92]It's designed to do that.
[261:28.99]Alright.
[261:37.91]Keep the go.
[261:41.40]Don't give me the ha-has.
[261:42.30]Come on.
[261:42.74]That was cool.
[261:44.12]You thought that was cool.
[261:47.82]F-U-C-K-E-D, right?
[261:49.22]Alright.
[262:06.46]That's a callback to a grandpa video guys really come on Am I doing this right?
[262:38.03]I wasn't by the way.
[262:40.27]Get fucked.
[263:01.87]This one feels nice.
[263:02.81]Streamer gets fucked by Nintendo Labo.
[263:09.80]Yeah, hey, get bent, you know what I mean?
[263:14.27]Wait, do I go that far?
[263:22.05]Like that?
[263:24.39]Yeah, that's like a line in grease.
[263:29.91]Ooh, this is tight.
[263:32.35]Ah!
[263:37.57]How badly have I fucked up?
[263:39.97]Actually, not at all.
[263:41.59]I haven't fucked up at all.
[263:44.03]I've done it perfectly every time.
[263:50.78]Jeremy Elbertson, did you just swear?
[263:54.08]Don't say my fucking full name, please.
[263:55.70]Do you have any Nintendo fanboys who are going to come find me?
[264:04.95]Alright, locked it in.
[264:13.63]That looks actually... Actually, you know what?
[264:15.43]I talked a lot of shit about Nintendo, but look at how cool that is.
[264:21.94]That actually is kind of cool.
[264:27.50]That spiral.
[264:31.15]He's unfocused.
[264:35.61]I just... What are you talking about?
[264:36.79]I'm focused.
[264:43.51]It's nice and rectangular, it is.
[264:48.03]He's drunk.
[264:51.34]Hey, see you in court.
[264:55.04]Defamation suit I got on you.
[265:00.73]He's drunk, I wasn't.
[265:01.75]Defamation lawsuit.
[265:15.91]to goddamn legal action.
[265:20.17]Again, this is the most fun one of the whole night.
[265:23.55]I can feel it.
[265:27.69]It's so, like that, you can't beat that feeling.
[265:34.61]You hear it?
[265:34.97]Is this too many folds?
[265:40.93]No, no, no, no, it's perfect.
[265:47.13]What about peeling the cellophane over the electron?
[266:12.74]What are you talking about?
[266:17.63]Check it.
[266:23.05]Check my work, please.
[266:25.55]Check it.
[266:34.26]Is it done?
[266:37.86]Looks atrocious.
[266:41.24]Get that guy out of the channel.
[266:42.57]I don't want to see his name ever again.
[266:45.05]Time for another quick check.
[266:46.15]Does the arm?
[266:46.71]It sure does.
[266:54.02]This is menacing.
[266:55.44]We're at the tower right now.
[267:05.59]Don't embarrass me.
[267:13.78]Kim wants to wax me on stream.
[267:18.52]That's not going to happen.
[267:20.92]And that's not going to fucking happen.
[267:22.66]I'm not going to get waxed on stream.
[267:25.05]No fucking way.
[267:25.85]Not in a thousand years.
[267:27.95]Kim, sweetheart.
[267:29.57]Yeah, you might be watching the stream.
[267:30.83]Yeah, you ain't waxing me on stream.
[267:32.25]Not a fucking million years.
[267:37.36]No fucking way.
[267:41.88]She's upstairs watching the stream right now.
[267:44.60]She's part of the antagonization of chat.
[267:53.02]No.
[267:54.54]No, I ain't doing it.
[268:00.33]I ain't doing it.
[268:01.17]It ain't happening.
[268:03.61]Smosh did it.
[268:04.59]I don't care if Smosh did this.
[268:13.90]I haven't watched Smosh since they did that Pokémon video like nine years ago.
[268:21.07]Alright, what do I do with these two tabs?
[268:23.49]Sweetheart, I know you're watching right now.
[268:25.53]I'm working on two tabs.
[268:28.43]Can't get waxed.
[268:29.69]Not gonna happen.
[268:31.35]Hey sweetie!
[268:34.15]Not gonna happen.
[268:37.65]Alright, time to connect the arms.
[268:44.30]Wait, what's happening?
[268:45.06]Hold on.
[268:47.96]Connect the arms and the orange strings.
[268:51.99]Thread them properly.
[268:55.00]Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R symbol on it and tie it to the arm.
[269:01.92]Take the string from the shoulder strap with the R symbol on it.
[269:08.28]Like this fucking guy.
[269:09.52]Alright, hold on.
[269:10.40]Easy.
[269:22.74]Alright.
[269:23.54]R. This one's R. Where the fuck is this going?
[269:31.49]To the R hand.
[269:33.73]So this is going... God damn it.
[269:36.39]Hold on.
[269:41.21]Who the fuck is out there?
[269:42.57]Hey, somebody... Hey!
[269:44.46]Somebody out there?
[269:48.72]Mosquito in here.
[269:51.08]Got him.
[269:52.57]You don't stand a chance if you're a fucking Skeeto in here.
[269:54.47]Okay.
[270:06.80]Pass the string through the hole in the arm.
[270:09.59]You won't need to pass too much of it though, about as much as you can see on the screen.
[270:13.81]What the fuck?
[270:15.27]Where's this going?
[270:17.77]R?
[270:18.67]Which side?
[270:19.19]Does it matter?
[270:22.42]Does it matter what side?
[270:28.88]That's it?
[270:31.50]That's it.
[270:34.86]I hate this.
[270:39.30]I feel like I'm gonna get angry at you.
[270:41.12]Alright, that's it.
[270:42.54]Tie it tightly around the side.
[270:44.24]Oh, fuck you.
[270:45.30]Hold on.
[270:46.22]Ooh.
[270:49.32]Tie it tightly around the side.
[270:52.03]Am I doing this right?
[270:52.83]Like this?
[270:58.33]I don't even know what I want to do with this thing.
[271:02.33]Stick it in there.
[271:02.95]Oh, I'm gonna wax my asshole on stream.
[271:08.09]Why did I just, why did I say that?
[271:12.88]Somebody said it and then I said it again.
[271:15.70]How quickly would I get banned, Spencer?
[271:17.36]I know you're still here.
[271:24.92]Second knot.
[271:28.19]Okay, second knot.
[271:33.81]What's in the jar?
[271:34.57]What the fuck you talking about?
[271:38.67]What jar?
[271:40.31]What's in the jar?
[271:45.17]What jar?
[271:56.11]This is 82 people.
[271:59.19]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[272:00.18]It's not tight enough.
[272:01.54]Is it not tight enough?
[272:03.78]It's too light.
[272:04.48]No, it is.
[272:05.12]I got it.
[272:17.90]There's a candle, man.
[272:30.71]It's not there's nothing in here Oh, what's that?
[272:50.44]I'm sorry Chad.
[272:52.56]Oh got ya.
[272:53.14]Oh, oh
[273:05.43]No, that's fine.
[273:08.09]I thought I fucked up my monitor.
[273:09.15]I didn't.
[273:12.39]Okay, so let's tie tight.
[273:14.19]Wrap this.
[273:14.87]Hold on a second.
[273:15.51]Jesus Christ.
[273:16.23]You got more shit for me to do?
[273:18.75]Wrap the string around the top of the arm.
[273:20.84]Like this.
[273:28.00]And then this way.
[273:33.62]Like this.
[273:38.35]Why am I trying to do, like, a fat stomach?
[273:42.72]All the way.
[273:48.78]Okay, this is all the way.
[273:59.53]Once you've found the arm and about this far from the backpack, part of the robot, go ahead and stop.
[274:04.36]Not for a tricky part.
[274:06.22]Ah!
[274:14.34]OK.
[274:15.94]Take the string and pull it down through the hole through the notch in the top of the arm.
[274:22.32]What the fuck are you talking about?
[274:33.00]Like that.
[274:38.99]Pulling it down hard enough might scrunch up the top of the arm.
[274:41.63]If that happens, just squish it back into shape.
[274:44.33]Okay, it's in there.
[274:45.17]Oh, I gotta go all the way... Huh?
[274:53.39]All the way down?
[274:54.01]A bug just bit me in the back.
[275:04.80]All the... How...
[275:15.67]Holy shit, I broke it.
[275:16.53]No, I didn't.
[275:16.95]It's in there.
[275:18.00]That's it.
[275:19.54]The right arm is good to go.
[275:25.82]Same thing with the left arm.
[275:27.18]This is kind of getting awkward as hell.
[275:30.16]Awkward as hell!
[275:32.42]Take the string from the shoulder strap of the L-single and attach the arm.
[275:38.94]Just enough.
[275:42.36]Hydrate right now?
[275:43.26]I refuse.
[275:43.78]You're not going to make me do it.
[275:48.01]Same thing, just slide it through.
[275:48.89]Just enough, right?
[275:49.27]Then tie tie tie tie tie tie tie tie tie tie?
[275:59.27]What does this want me to- what happened?
[276:03.37]Wait what is it doing? I didn't- I didn't do it like that.
[276:07.37]They're playing snake with me, hold on.
[276:19.37]I'm just going to do it the way I did it before.
[276:23.63]Fuck it.
[276:31.59]That's one tie.
[276:32.61]And then another.
[276:36.55]Two ties.
[276:37.23]Two ties.
[276:39.66]Don't get yourself in any trouble.
[276:41.42]Two ties.
[276:48.32]You have to hydrate to keep those guns in shape.
[276:50.88]I drank like fucking a gallon of water today.
[276:52.56]I'm fine.
[276:54.50]Okay, that's good.
[276:55.14]That's nice and tight.
[276:57.04]I'm going to wrap this one around, right?
[277:02.81]Yep, hold on.
[277:03.35]Let's make sure I got it right.
[277:05.35]It's around the side here.
[277:06.83]Looks good.
[277:07.41]Wrap it around.
[277:08.45]Here we go.
[277:11.99]Tight.
[277:13.47]Same deal when we get to the end.
[277:18.04]What's the purpose of this shit?
[277:20.48]I don't understand this.
[277:23.48]That's not how hydration works.
[277:24.48]I drank a gallon of water at 4 in the morning.
[277:27.16]Today.
[277:27.66]Like, Friday.
[277:28.82]Like, 5 in the morning.
[277:29.52]I drank a full gallon of water.
[277:32.11]I haven't peed once.
[277:37.49]I just did super hydration.
[277:39.11]I took a super hydration drink.
[277:40.61]Okay, same deal with this one.
[277:44.51]Get through about here and then just stick that through there.
[277:47.25]Drive it all the way down.
[277:52.47]Got it.
[277:55.09]Okay, that's the left hand done.
[277:58.61]Now what?
[278:03.31]See?
[278:06.00]Your robot arms are now done.
[278:08.56]Do the arms pull in and out like they should?
[278:10.76]Take a moment to double check.
[278:20.67]It works.
[278:24.89]It actually fucking works.
[278:26.91]You thought I was going to knock this over.
[278:28.56]I'm going to paint my fucking ceiling tomorrow.
[278:39.54]Oh man, I shouldn't be drinking.
[278:45.49]You've done it.
[278:51.22]Oh, we're almost there.
[278:52.80]Making the robot shoes.
[278:55.24]Oh my lord.
[278:56.04]Okay, put this back down.
[278:57.60]Down here.
[279:06.97]Painting stream.
[279:07.73]You're not going to see that.
[279:08.63]No.
[279:09.19]Hey, it's me.
[279:09.75]My face is back here again.
[279:14.09]No, I'm not going to stream that.
[279:15.76]That's private.
[279:18.44]B and G.
[279:23.73]Can you guys tell me what that says there?
[279:33.94]Wasp, huh?
[279:34.68]I'll fucking eat them with my bare hands.
[279:38.14]B and G. B and G, make sure you get the right piece.
[279:49.45]This is the one here.
[279:55.94]I want you guys to be able to see what I'm doing.
[280:05.25]That's it for now.
[280:07.57]Okay.
[280:11.33]Legs.
[280:13.26]Bulge.
[280:15.44]A four-hour project takes, man, seven hours.
[280:17.50]That's not true.
[280:18.38]Look, we had a little bit of extra computer time, but that's just because we were talking and having a good time as friends in chat room.
[280:42.31]I'm like the annoying guy that sits behind you in lunch.
[280:46.49]He's trying to get you with like a piece of cardboard.
[280:56.36]Got you, right in the head.
[281:04.60]You smashed my tots.
[281:10.12]Cut it out, ow!
[281:11.88]Jerma annoying.
[281:22.79]Hold it in half, I'm assuming, right?
[281:24.25]Just once in half.
[281:30.42]Hey look, it's Rob, the other Nintendo character that didn't make it into Smash.
[281:35.90]Oh no.
[281:36.58]Oh fuck.
[281:44.18]Last two straps, here they are.
[281:53.61]So let's slip the loop at the end of one strap over the hook on one side of the piece.
[281:57.23]The seam, I forgot what you said.
[282:01.13]This looks like right here.
[282:04.79]He's in smash.
[282:05.99]No, he's not.
[282:08.07]So hook this on to here.
[282:15.45]Rob, is it?
[282:15.93]Yes, he is.
[282:16.37]No, he isn't.
[282:20.74]That.
[282:25.85]Yes, he is.
[282:26.29]No, he's not.
[282:29.61]Alright, now it's time for the piece with the R on it, OK?
[282:42.78]OK, I guess he's not.
[282:47.04]No, he is, right?
[282:47.80]Everybody is.
[282:52.90]That's the whole point of Smash Ultimate, right?
[282:55.19]everybody's back everybody's in okay not Waluigi but why would he be in a game like that he there's no reason for him to be in that game I mean like as a collectible assist trophy that's fine
[283:32.27]He sucks.
[283:32.67]He deserves his own game.
[283:33.75]No, he does not.
[283:38.37]Fold over the angle you see on the stream.
[283:40.33]Okay, on the stream.
[283:41.51]So now what?
[283:48.07]Then pass the strap through the hole below the R mark.
[283:55.21]Okay, like in here.
[284:02.10]How far up?
[284:02.60]Like all the way?
[284:06.34]Are the two pieces pointing the same direction?
[284:08.84]Double check now before we put them together for good.
[284:15.45]I think so.
[284:19.67]When Mario does the big fart, I love that move.
[284:21.57]Yeah, that's a great move.
[284:25.86]Why does the robot need shoes?
[284:28.46]I have no idea what the hell they're doing here.
[284:29.92]This is weird.
[284:31.97]The pieces have matched perfectly.
[284:33.19]Did yours match the same shape as the ones on the screen?
[284:35.79]Now it's time to check.
[284:36.67]It looks pretty accurate, I think.
[284:42.09]No, that matches pretty well.
[284:46.09]The hole just above the R mark.
[284:49.50]I can see all the way through.
[284:50.58]Yes, I can.
[284:52.06]Looks fine.
[284:55.21]Pull it down, the strap is fine.
[284:58.70]A red mitt, that's timber backwards.
[285:02.04]Anyway, stand the piece on its side for now.
[285:07.64]Pass the strap through the holes.
[285:12.13]Waluigi's the best.
[285:13.15]He's not though.
[285:14.25]You're just saying that because you feel bad for him.
[285:19.82]Right to the first R here.
[285:30.02]All the way through.
[285:35.21]This part can get confusing.
[285:36.37]You want to be extra careful.
[285:37.59]Watch the screen closely.
[285:43.95]Red Mint for Smash.
[285:48.62]That's correct, right?
[285:51.76]Strap is not twisted.
[285:52.84]It looks fine.
[285:55.32]Pass it through the hole above the arm mark.
[285:57.00]I just did that.
[286:01.53]Stop right there, you don't want a strap to pass all the way through, so like that.
[286:06.47]Looks pretty much the same.
[286:09.41]Okay.
[286:12.69]You want it big enough to fit one of your feet.
[286:17.37]Strap will go through the zig-zaggy hole beside the first one.
[286:22.47]Okay, my feet can fit through that.
[286:25.43]Should be fine, so through here.
[286:26.75]Should be a little bit smaller, just because I wanna stuff my foot in there.
[286:32.33]All the way back through.
[286:40.65]Feet.
[286:42.43]Show your feet.
[286:45.68]Fucking relax.
[286:48.88]Alright, it's through here.
[286:51.68]Whip all the way.
[286:52.40]How have I kept up 3000 viewers for five hours?
[287:02.14]I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[287:09.48]Because these people are fucking really supportive, wonderful people.
[287:16.41]Are we having fun?
[287:17.03]I'm having a good time.
[287:17.71]You're having a good, you're having a good time?
[287:20.79]You're not having a good time.
[287:21.89]Okay, that shoe is ready.
[287:29.05]Let's make sure the shoe will fit.
[287:30.23]I'll need some help to demonstrate, okay.
[287:35.20]Look, let's show feet.
[287:37.26]Ah, Ms.
[287:37.68]Mannequin, right foot, you're just in time.
[287:39.43]Please lend us a hand.
[287:41.33]Okay.
[287:51.53]The darker of the two sides should be facing away from your... Did you do it right?
[287:57.08]Okay.
[288:03.48]Okay.
[288:14.45]Looks good, right?
[288:18.61]Will you fucking relax?
[288:21.67]Holy shit.
[288:22.17]CadBTV just gave five community subs.
[288:27.69]That fits.
[288:31.94]Got it right.
[288:33.60]Thank you, CadBTV, for the five community subs.
[288:36.64]Thanks a lot, dude.
[288:39.08]Hold the strap.
[288:39.70]Tighten the loop.
[288:40.66]Oh, wait a minute.
[288:41.26]Hold on.
[288:46.51]Okay, that's tightened.
[288:49.95]Pass the rest through the last hole.
[288:53.33]Like this.
[289:00.18]That works, right?
[289:05.94]That works.
[289:06.42]I think it's correct.
[289:14.02]That's not a shoe.
[289:15.16]That's a robot shoe.
[289:19.23]Okay, the right shoe is done.
[289:21.39]How do I get it off?
[289:22.61]I can't get it off.
[289:23.23]Okay, I got it off.
[289:30.44]Attach this to the backpack.
[289:36.98]Double check the backpack quickly.
[289:39.72]This is the most important part.
[289:40.58]We want the light blue string to pass through the three eyelids.
[289:44.87]No, it is.
[289:45.81]No, it is.
[289:49.70]Why am I so sweaty?
[289:50.58]I don't, I don't know.
[290:12.95]Okay.
[290:15.87]Why are you so dry?
[290:19.89]Alright, so then now let's tie the light blue to the narrow part of the shoe.
[290:26.69]Jesus fucking Christ.
[290:40.58]This is the right side, right shoe.
[290:45.22]Leave.
[290:52.44]Hide around here.
[291:06.30]He looks wasted.
[291:07.22]Spencer, how do I delete somebody else's post?
[291:19.95]That?
[291:22.55]Again, right?
[291:27.71]Die not again.
[291:37.04]Get this.
[291:38.52]Done.
[291:38.98]Okay.
[291:42.90]Tied.
[291:47.83]And then roll it up.
[291:49.09]Now we'll loop the thread around the narrow part of the shoe.
[291:51.83]Let's aim for the eight turns.
[291:54.33]So, okay, one.
[291:55.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[291:58.61]How did he start?
[291:59.09]Which way is he going?
[291:59.65]It's like this.
[292:04.23]So, one, two.
[292:06.79]No, how many turns is he talking about?
[292:09.62]That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[292:15.98]Oh, I don't even know.
[292:18.13]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[292:21.71]Like that.
[292:24.49]Right?
[292:24.85]OK.
[292:46.10]Now push the string through the little round opening above the looped string.
[292:49.20]If it's hard to do, you can bend the side parts a little.
[292:53.50]Oh, fuck.
[292:54.14]OK, like this.
[293:04.22]Got it.
[293:04.54]OK, like that.
[293:06.52]Like that.
[293:09.34]Tear the string.
[293:10.06]I'm not tearing the string.

[309:41.31]This comes down like this.
[309:42.77]I don't fucking get it.
[309:48.13]Like that.
[309:50.57]Okay, that's good enough.
[309:52.71]Is somebody coming in here?
[309:59.61]Snap these in.
[310:05.44]Is there a piano?
[310:08.26]Alright, these are both tapped at the same time.
[310:13.21]On this side, so both have to go in together.
[310:19.73]One in here, one in there.
[310:21.13]There's that one and this one.
[310:27.88]Get in there.

[311:32.61]That's correct.
[311:33.41]I'm good.
[311:34.90]Flip it over.
[311:39.40]Left and right panels so that they're level with the rest of the cover, just like on screen.
[311:44.50]Got it.
[311:46.06]You built.
[311:46.79]That's it.

[311:52.45]I beat the game.
[311:53.89]I fucking won.
[311:55.29]I didn't take any damage either.
[311:56.43]Holy shit.
[312:00.45]Uh, what'd you do today?
[312:01.23]I watched a full grown man put together some cardboard.
[312:06.82]Would you really trade that for anything else?
[312:12.82]Turn it back this way.
[312:30.70]G. This looks like the last of G. It is.
[312:38.40]There's only one more sheet in there.
[312:41.66]We're almost there, guys.
[312:43.64]Get ready for the final fucking little bit here.
[312:47.21]And our $80 fucking cardboard robot can finally flourish.
[312:53.05]That's it for G. G is done.
[313:07.53]What the fuck do you want me to do?

[313:13.74]Show cat.
[313:15.36]I'm not showing a cat.
[313:17.80]Cat's on vacation anyways.
[313:19.80]So we're moving.
[313:20.66]So cat has to go on vacation until we get there.
[313:30.33]Like this, right?
[313:31.77]Like that?
[313:33.01]I'm going to use the McDonald's box for this.
[313:41.98]Show rat.
[313:42.52]I don't own a rat.
[313:46.06]I don't own a fucking rat.
[313:47.58]We just talked about how much I wish I did.
[313:49.87]Talking about my IQ?
[314:01.21]It's like 170.
[314:03.97]I think I'm dragging.
[314:04.77]I don't know.
[314:05.03]It's a lot.
[314:05.71]It's a large amount.
[314:14.16]Okay, yep.
[314:16.16]The whole thing comes over like this.
[314:23.01]There's too many things going on here.
[314:26.47]Another little tab that folds this way.
[314:28.55]Got it.
[314:33.03]Rotate the piece.
[314:33.61]It's easier to work with.
[314:34.77]So like this.
[314:35.70]I don't know why.
[314:38.52]Oh boy, the whole thing folds up like this.
[314:46.33]And then this comes around the side.
[314:48.83]Oh my goodness, okay.
[314:54.97]Snaps in here.
[314:58.59]Click.
[315:00.13]Pretty sweet actually, okay.

[316:35.53]Insert the holder until all four legs press to get the cover.
[316:37.85]There they are.
[316:39.83]Flip it around.
[316:44.59]Now this comes over.
[316:45.51]Sergeant Stauffer reporting for duty.
[316:46.57]Take a close look at the screen.
[316:47.69]Make sure the officer's made the right way.
[316:49.17]He is.
[316:53.63]He goes on top.
[316:59.13]And then fold on the flap of the sergeant's right side.
[317:02.38]Stop giving it names.
[317:03.58]Just save the fucking tab.
[317:06.62]Same thing on the other side.
[317:07.70]Yes, okay.
[317:08.36]So that just goes down like this.

[317:19.32]This is not big enough.
[317:20.41]This hole's not big enough for this shit.
[317:48.56]Death grips, no, I'm not playing music.
[317:51.75]Just relax, just fucking read a book.
[317:57.43]Give the tabs a little bit of a nudge.
[318:05.16]Like that.
[318:07.88]Read death grips.
[318:10.22]No, relax.
[318:12.40]Cover is done.
[318:13.04]Flip the cover over to get ready to attach the rest of the backpack.
[318:22.10]Labo symbol.
[318:24.70]Flat like that.
[318:29.24]Big backpack coming up.
[318:30.26]We need to open the lid of the backpack.
[318:54.39]This is how you open it with the whole thing is done, so try to remember.
[318:58.62]Out, out.

[382:20.66]Thanks for the $1.
[382:21.46]Hey, Jerma, I'm really high.
[382:23.48]I just want to say I love you.
[382:27.46]Don't tell people that.
[382:28.86]You're going to get yourself in trouble.
[382:30.61]Don't ever put down on paper something you did illegally.
[382:39.35]Dude, weed.
[382:41.13]No, but right back at you, dude.
[382:43.99]Thank you.
[382:44.65]Steven, not a coin.
[382:47.30]Be careful what you record on the internet, though.
[382:48.96]Be careful.
[382:50.80]Uh, Codeman.
[382:51.64]Thank you, Codeman, for the $1.
[382:52.80]Hey, Jeremy, I found your channel the last time you built the motorcycle labo and was an instant fan.
[382:59.84]I've been binge-watching your stuff on YouTube when I have the time to catch up, and hands down, you're one of the new favorite streamers.
[383:05.66]Keep up all the good work.
[383:08.44]Welcome, Codeman.
[383:11.96]Uh, welcome to the channel.
[383:13.26]I'm glad you enjoy the content.
[383:14.33]Thank you.
[383:15.25]Hope you stick around.
[383:18.57]Uh, Galaxia.
[383:19.87]Galaxia Fa.
[383:22.15]Thank you for the $1.
[383:24.33]I don't know if somebody already asked you this, but are you planning on buying Smash Ultimate?
[383:28.41]Yes, I am.
[383:30.61]I will play it at least for a stream or so.
[383:33.76]We'll play it for like maybe a stream or two.
[383:37.88]Against some friends or something?
[383:39.40]We'll see.
[383:42.14]Thank you Chubby Funster for the $2.
[383:43.86]Hey Jerma, I was wondering, is your butt a keyboard?
[383:45.86]Because I would tap it repeatedly for hours.
[384:18.26]Okay.
[384:18.72]Thank you to... Thank you to... Who's next?
[384:25.50]Who's next on the list?
[384:30.82]Thank you.
[384:31.18]Bake me home for the $5.
[384:33.76]That slurring your turds fuck up followed by typing words save was fantastic.
[384:39.84]I try.
[384:42.00]Sometimes you fail.
[384:43.30]Sometimes you don't.
[384:44.88]I try.
[384:45.64]Thank you.
[384:47.50]Uh, Shootman, thank you for the $1, Shootman.
[384:49.50]Just want to say thank you for representing smooth-brained people everywhere.
[384:55.27]What does that mean?
[384:55.77]It's good to have a role model and nice to know that your brain isn't wrinkly like the old man's face.
[385:01.23]It's more like smooth putty.
[385:03.15]Have a good night and let the cardboard enter your dreams.
[385:08.60]Smooth brain?
[385:10.46]What does that mean?
[385:13.98]I don't, okay, thank you.
[385:16.18]Uh, appreciate it.
[385:18.51]Thank you Chubby Funster for the $1.
[385:19.69]Why are you so lewd with these Labo streams?
[385:22.31]It's not me.
[385:24.43]It's somebody makes a comment over and over again about like my ass crack sweat and I have to address it.
[385:32.01]It's not me.
[385:35.65]Thank you Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[385:37.71]Ambassador Garfield here.
[385:38.95]I feel like I'm the brainy Smurf of Chatna.
[385:42.75]I'm going to be like Papa Smurf.
[385:44.88]Made me the ambassador, and Papa Smurf knows everything, and I'm clearly the best donator.
[385:50.27]Garf's gotta learn to be more human.
[385:53.25]Gotta be a good role model to the saber-toothed goof-goofs.
[385:57.51]Anyway, since you wound up liking Infinity War, what character other than Thanos did you wind up liking?
[386:04.14]I liked Rocket Raccoon and Groot.
[386:06.16]Thanos and Ven are good.
[386:08.98]Toon representation.
[386:10.18]I mean, I thought Thanos was great.
[386:15.52]No other character matters in that whole entire movie.
[386:17.60]Thanos is the best character.
[386:19.14]Nobody else matters.
[386:30.01]I am Groot.
[386:31.15]I am Groot.
[386:32.99]Only smooth brains like Thanos.
[386:40.72]Thanos is the best character in the whole entire fucking movie.
[386:44.71]Thanos is a great character.
[386:45.77]Look him up.
[386:49.81]Uh, but thank you, Garfield.
[386:50.67]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the three bucks.
[386:52.13]If you're not drunk, you will surely be able to say this five times really fast, right?
[386:55.67]Okay.
[386:58.17]Uh... I slit the sheet, the sheet I slit, and on the slitted sheet I sit.
[387:03.55]I slit the sheet, the sheet I slit, and on the slitted... sleet I shit on it.
[387:07.46]Whatever.
[387:07.80]You're trying to get me to say a shit on somebody's sheets.
[387:10.02]It doesn't matter.
[387:10.72]I did it first time.
[387:11.52]First try.
[387:12.34]Thank you, Powerful of you...
[387:14.60]Parfolomew for the $1.
[387:15.78]Do you sneeze into your hand, your elbow, or just straight into your food?
[387:28.37]Into my elbow.
[387:29.23]I go like into my elbow.
[387:33.12]Oh, that was good.
[387:34.54]Hey, Kirby.
[387:35.14]Thank you, Kirby.
[387:36.18]Thank you, the Cosmonator.
[387:38.76]For the $1, you got a clip here.
[387:40.54]Let's take a look.
[387:43.33]Oh, okay.
[387:45.08]We need more anus.
[387:48.16]There is no anus on this stream ever.
[387:50.80]So why would you be asking for more of something that's never happened?
[387:53.84]You can only ask for more if you've had it before.
[387:57.50]It's true.
[387:57.80]I've never served that here.
[388:01.42]I've never served anus.
[388:03.04]It's not been something that's been on the menu ever.
[388:05.83]Where's the lie here?
[388:13.65]Guy has no anus.
[388:16.78]What are you clipping here?
[388:18.06]That's the truth.
[388:20.90]Thank you, Cosmator.
[388:21.83]Appreciate it.
[388:24.13]BananaSlammerJr, thank you for the $50 earlier.
[388:26.47]If you're still here, you rock, dude.
[388:28.93]Thank you so much for that.
[388:30.79]We already talked about it, but thank you.
[388:33.55]Traxier, thank you, Traxier, for the $10.
[388:39.33]Longtime fans started watching you ever since you got Shoutout from Star on a TF2 vid.
[388:44.36]Glad you're still entertaining us.
[388:47.11]Glad you're still watching.
[388:51.54]Those are the old days.
[388:54.38]Old school.
[388:55.04]That's the old times, huh?
[388:57.12]You've been around for a long time.
[388:58.68]Thank you, Traxy.
[389:00.56]Thank you, Tracker.
[389:01.83]That's probably how you pronounce it.
[389:02.77]Thank you for the $10, dude.
[389:03.67]Appreciate it.
[389:05.13]Topac, thanks for two bucks.
[389:06.93]God, I loved when you stuck it.
[389:10.19]Oh, that's a clip.
[389:15.38]You guys are still getting away with this shit.
[389:17.73]Thank you, Topac.
[389:18.53]Thank you, Swoose McGoose for the $1 play.
[389:22.47]Duke Nukem?
[389:24.53]No, probably not.
[389:25.15]Thank you for the suggestion, though.
[389:28.23]Thank you, Maridical.
[389:30.25]Your name is not that.
[389:32.87]I can't help it.
[389:34.15]Thank you for the $1.
[389:34.93]They're selling Halloween candy already.
[389:37.22]So I bought a box of 100 mini chocolates yesterday to munch on.
[389:41.88]I had like 20 and I'm paying for it tonight.
[389:44.84]Thanks for keeping me entertained on the can.
[389:47.82]Good luck.
[389:49.38]Good luck.
[389:50.00]That's always not good when you eat fucking shitty Halloween candy.
[389:54.39]Nico Knee, $50 earlier again.
[389:57.11]Tons of fucking money came through tonight.
[390:00.25]Thank you guys all so much.
[390:04.25]Much love to you, Nico.
[390:09.25]Captain Worgen, thank you for the $1.
[390:11.07]You are now in emote-only mode.
[390:12.69]Dab to enable talking again.
[390:18.75]Chat is now enabled.
[390:21.75]Thank you, Greasy Streaker for the $1.
[390:24.29]A thing.
[390:24.87]That's all they say.
[390:27.32]Agent Pigeon, thank you.
[390:28.82]Honey Chain, thank you for the $1.
[390:29.98]Hey, Jerma, just watched the VOD of your overcooked stream and it reminded me of when I worked in a pizzeria.
[390:36.44]Oh, I want pizza now.
[390:37.50]Fuck.
[390:38.42]I love pizza.
[390:40.20]And not in like an ironic fucking pretend way.
[390:42.42]I love pizza.
[390:45.18]Oh, I want it.
[390:49.24]thin crust crispy very thin crust with a bunch of toppings on it oh my god there's no it's one o'clock in the morning I'm thank you uh honey chain though uh remind me when I worked at a pizzeria I loved working there unfortunately it had to close after an employee died after he accidentally locked himself in the walk-in oven
[391:18.86]Anyway, much love to you.
[391:19.92]You have nice arms.
[391:21.88]What the, what the fuck?
[391:24.66]Did this really happen?
[391:28.50]You just like dragged it down.
[391:30.28]That's awful.
[391:31.04]That's terrible.
[391:32.72]I'm so sorry.
[391:36.10]A walk-in oven.
[391:39.10]This is, what?
[391:40.68]This is not real.
[391:42.45]A walk-in?
[391:44.35]You don't walk, what are you gonna put the pizza on the floor?
[391:47.31]That's not, is that real?
[391:52.64]That can't be real.
[391:59.01]Why would you have a lock on that?
[392:00.79]I don't, Honey Chain, you're gonna have to give us some more details here.
[392:07.05]Is it real?
[392:09.63]What?
[392:10.64]No way.
[392:12.60]Walk-in oven pizza.
[392:26.04]I don't see any of this anywhere.
[392:29.98]Walk-in pizzeria.
[392:31.76]Well, that's fucking horrible, man, if that's true.
[392:35.99]At Jerma, he lied.
[392:37.99]I think I got gnomed.
[392:48.90]Every pizzeria is walking.
[392:52.22]Thank you.
[392:53.14]If that's real, I'm sorry to hear about that, dude.
[392:54.84]But thank you for the $1.
[392:55.82]Appreciate it.
[392:56.24]Thank you Chubby Funster for the $1.
[392:58.72]So during the part of the stream where you said you would most likely be a horse, you also said this in the clip.
[393:05.24]And I don't get it.
[393:06.24]Could you please elaborate?
[393:07.46]Sure.
[393:10.84]Fucking idiot.
[393:15.97]It's Sweeney.
[393:17.45]Thank you for the $5.
[393:18.09]Hey, Jerma, lad, to support the stream any ways I can.
[393:23.98]Been watching for years now.
[393:26.06]Even though I miss a good chunk of the streams, you've been my main source of entertainment over the years.
[393:30.28]Oh, by the way, Nintendo Labo Fighter for a Jerma Rumble.
[393:33.00]Also, hi, chat.
[393:35.16]Hi, it's Sweeney.
[393:35.90]Thank you.
[393:37.76]Thank you for the $5.
[393:38.86]And I'm sure there'll be like a fucking motorcycle in the Rumble from Labo.
[393:45.06]But thanks a lot, man.
[393:46.52]Thank you, sdogaman, for the $10 here.
[393:48.76]$10 from sdogaman.
[393:51.40]Dermot, do you have a device?
[393:53.56]I'll try.
[393:53.88]I've been feeling really against the world lately, just like everything doesn't go my way and annoys the hell out of me.
[394:01.49]I have two friends I play competitive Overwatch with, and they're constantly giving me crap.
[394:06.53]I said I didn't like it, and they said stop being a baby.
[394:10.71]You have control over your own choice to react.
[394:12.95]How do you deal with shitty people?
[394:15.29]If it wasn't for bringing you on your old videos, I'd be feeling a lot worse.
[394:19.35]Thank you for always being there to cheer me up.
[394:23.25]Well, how do you deal with shitty people?
[394:27.86]Well, you deal with shitty people by being a better person.
[394:33.06]Those don't sound like very good friends, right?
[394:37.12]You surround yourself with people that you get along with.
[394:39.40]You surround yourself with people that make you happy.
[394:44.59]I think...
[394:47.08]the key to dealing with people that you don't like is not dealing with them at all.
[394:54.81]You know what I'm saying?
[395:03.72]You deserve better friends.
[395:11.18]Overwatch is toxic.
[395:13.08]I think...
[395:15.02]Let me be really Frank with you here.
[395:18.24]A lot of... A lot of fucking games now are like that.
[395:25.71]A lot of games have turned into just mean, mad fucking people.
[395:32.19]Mad and pissed all the time.
[395:38.34]Fun is consistently being sucked out of these games.
[395:42.90]Because people just need to be so good and need to care.
[395:46.24]I have to be so good.
[395:48.16]But why?
[395:49.40]What happened?
[395:52.74]Is it like the e-sports thing took over and all of a sudden everybody has to be like a super try-hard in every game?
[395:58.17]Like what happened?
[396:03.23]Winning is fun, but is it... Winning is fun, it's true, but is it not... Is it more important to have fun with your friends or is it more important to win?
[396:13.70]I wonder.
[396:20.53]Definitely fun.
[396:21.63]Some people only want to win.
[396:23.39]But that's my point here is where did that come from?
[396:26.69]Where did I have to win every time come from?
[396:29.41]It wasn't like that a few years ago.
[396:31.51]Five, six years ago, it was not like that.
[396:36.61]Matchmaking took over instead of community servers and increased competitiveness.
[396:43.77]I guess so.
[396:47.57]But people are just very angry.
[396:54.54]Most online games are pushed to be competitive.
[396:58.04]I think that's a mistake.
[397:00.20]I think competitive games are incredible.
[397:05.48]But I think that pushing a game to have to be competitive is the wrong way to do it.
[397:12.54]I think an organic community should form out of those games.
[397:17.22]Rather than, hey, go play competitive and try as hard as you fucking can.
[397:23.13]And we're focusing on competitive.
[397:30.01]MMR drives people insane.
[397:35.30]And there is a place for it.
[397:36.26]There really is.
[397:36.88]This is not a dog towards, oh, I love competitive.
[397:39.64]What are you talking about, dude?
[397:41.47]No, there is a place for it, but I think a lot of times it gets taken a little too far.
[397:47.81]People feel like they have to be competitive.
[397:57.45]If we all dialed it back like 20 to 30% here, I don't think there would be as much toxicity as there is in these online games.
[398:09.66]Why do you think I don't play these games anymore?
[398:12.18]Because I saw a very real shift three, four, five years ago from don't play unless you're the best.
[398:23.09]You know what I'm saying?
[398:27.51]That's a mentality that a lot of people seem to have nowadays.
[398:33.14]It's because you suck.
[398:34.16]Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[398:38.25]It didn't matter.
[398:39.45]It didn't matter like a few years ago.
[398:46.54]Mad goes bad.
[398:48.46]Get good.
[398:59.85]You missed the point.
[399:03.53]Followers, money, skill, not just for fun.
[399:09.38]yeah it got to it went in a different direction I love competitive games I love watching competitive games I love watching them big tournaments but not every not every game you play in has to be like you're in a tournament I feel like a lot of people don't see it that way if you're in a tournament by all means
[399:44.29]Labo Esports.
[399:47.17]Do you think streaming has anything to do with it?
[399:48.53]Maybe in-game moments were more private before.
[399:51.25]Now it's like all the pros are streaming.
[399:53.34]No, I mean, absolutely.
[399:55.10]It does.
[399:57.90]Right, so you have a guy that streams a game or makes videos and he's very, very good.
[400:03.30]Shows a bunch of people that are watching him or her.
[400:07.18]Look at how good I am at this game.
[400:08.78]I'm so fucking good.
[400:10.10]I'm one of the top probably 50 players in the world.
[400:14.16]And then people say, oh, fuck, man, that's awesome.
[400:16.56]Hold on, he's on the team and he's making a shitload of money?
[400:20.10]I'm pretty fucking good at that game.
[400:22.37]I'm going to try to do that shit too.
[400:26.77]And then it's almost like they take that by osmosis.
[400:34.31]What'd you say?
[400:35.03]I'm top 50 in the world.
[400:40.44]Overwatch made me lose a lot of friends.
[400:43.80]But that's not what this whole space should be about.
[400:47.20]It shouldn't be about losing your fucking friends over something that's supposed to bring you all together.
[400:57.36]Not even close.
[401:08.97]But... We could talk about this for hours.
[401:11.35]Um...
[401:14.88]To close that, I think that the space as a whole would do a lot better for itself if we all kind of just chilled out.
[401:29.57]Just a little.
[401:36.22]Just a little.
[401:37.72]I'm not saying like, we gotta get rid of it.
[401:39.96]No, just fucking relax.
[401:42.06]Just take like a couple of fucking deep breaths.
[401:43.86]You know what I mean?
[401:48.99]How do you incentivize that?
[401:53.39]I'm not sure you can at this point.
[401:55.97]I don't know if it's possible.
[401:59.96]We've gone down so far into the rabbit hole that it's hard to pull us all the way back.
[402:13.86]Actually, I saw an article about the WoW Classic servers.
[402:18.80]And how those coming back actually might help that game a lot.
[402:26.07]And how real community and real friendship was built in those games.
[402:31.73]I would be a proponent of that.
[402:32.93]I would.
[402:34.57]Remember Classic WoW?
[402:36.65]Those of you guys that played it?
[402:38.73]You had to be friends with people.
[402:39.90]You had to talk to people in your realm.
[402:42.30]If you were getting ganked, you had to like fucking go in the general chat and ask someone to help you.
[402:51.43]It was amazing.
[402:56.16]I mean, yeah, I may have punched through a window from getting ganked by a rogue five, ten times in a row.
[403:01.96]Like Arnold Schwarzenegger through a fucking window, but you know, I had somebody help me.
[403:10.33]These are new times, Jerem.
[403:11.47]I don't think old tricks will work.
[403:13.89]Probably, and this might be me as an old fucking loser speaking through rose-colored glasses, but
[403:23.48]I think this space could do well as a whole if we just kind of dialed it back to the origins of why we're playing in the first place.
[403:37.05]But to answer your question, Sdogman, we kind of went off on like a 15 minute rant there.
[403:48.59]I would try to find people that enjoy you.
[403:52.17]And not how well you play a game.
[403:56.15]That's how you make the best friends.
[404:02.79]Please, by all means.
[404:04.83]Check out the Discord.
[404:06.30]Lots of fucking people hang out there.
[404:07.58]I'm sure somebody would love to play Classic WoW with you.
[404:16.80]But yeah.
[404:18.24]Good luck to you.
[404:18.80]I'm sorry to hear about you having problems with your friends.
[404:22.56]Take care, and thank you for the $10, man.
[404:24.80]Really appreciate it.
[404:27.10]Thank you, Morning Maple, for the $3.
[404:29.31]Hey, Uncle Jeremy, Kill Code asked me to draw Fireman, and I made him extra handsome.
[404:34.09]He lost a little quirkiness in the process, but maybe this manly version is Fireman's father.
[404:43.56]Goodness, that is definitely... That's too real.
[404:50.56]You know what I mean?
[404:51.02]That's like looking into a mirror.
[404:52.50]That's Fireman looking into a mirror.
[404:54.28]A realism mirror.
[404:58.28]That's like handsome Squidward.
[405:03.11]That's Fire Hunk.
[405:06.37]He looks beautiful.
[405:10.79]He's literally hot.
[405:14.23]Thank you, Morning Maple.
[405:15.19]Looks great.
[405:17.11]Thanks for the sexy Fireman.

[405:36.75]Hot fucking oil, dude.

[406:25.25]I'm a fireman.
[406:27.91]I had, like... This little red label was probably three drinks.
[406:32.32]And then I had a cider.
[406:34.72]I've had, like, four drinks over the last six and a half hours.
[406:39.32]I'm good to go, man.

[409:23.47]This one's long.
[409:27.54]This video's like a...
[409:30.11]This video's like a minute long.
[409:32.17]Alright, let's do it.
[409:34.21]Let's watch it.
[409:41.22]This video might have a special guest in it.
[409:43.18]Let's see.
[409:49.37]So I think the thing about, I think going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[409:56.02]Oh shit, hold on, hold on.
[409:58.98]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[410:02.26]Okay, he landed.
[410:02.98]What the fuck is happening?
[410:31.04]Ooh, up in smoke.
[410:35.48]Did you see that?
[410:36.14]Look at these pogchamps.
[410:39.89]I don't understand what that was.
[410:42.01]But apparently Vinny, I did something to Vinny.
[410:44.53]Bad.
[410:45.99]Thank you, Darkstar.
[410:48.21]Thank you.
[410:48.65]Roll up for the one dollar.
[410:49.55]The old Jerma would have smashed it.
[410:53.21]No, the old Jerma would have
[410:55.10]Yeah, he probably would have.
[410:57.72]Thank you.
[410:58.88]Snooze, thanks for the $1.
[411:00.08]You remind me of George Costanza.
[411:03.48]Why?
[411:04.52]For what?
[411:05.30]Why?
[411:07.16]Why do I remind you of Costanza?
[411:10.31]I don't.
[411:13.33]Hey, Jerma, got another clone hero chart I think you might enjoy.
[411:16.01]I think the highlight of this is more the song itself, as I helped remaster the old Jerma marching band.
[411:22.82]I think it's great.
[411:23.38]It would be incredibly grateful if you show one of these on stream.
[411:27.87]Yeah.
[411:28.45]Let's do it.
[411:30.29]Fuck it.
[411:30.59]This video is titled Hi Twitch Chat.
[411:33.67]Let's go.
[411:33.97]Let's take a look.
[411:50.36]Expert.
[411:55.91]Hi, Squash.

[412:05.94]What the fuck?
[412:06.69]We did it.
[412:32.45]Oh, this is death grips.
[412:34.33]I'm listening to the song finally.
[412:37.83]This is the song.
[412:39.31]Where are the notes?
[412:59.78]No notes.
[413:01.92]He's just enjoying the song at this point.
[413:09.96]Okay, well, there it is.
[413:11.84]I was too lazy to chart the rest.
[413:17.68]They didn't expect me to still be on the video.
[413:19.88]I was interested.

[419:56.48]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $1.
[419:59.56]I know what it's like to hate Mondays, to feel so desperately that it's Sunday, yet to have time fail you nonetheless.
[420:06.37]It's frightening.
[420:07.27]Turns the lakes to lasagna.
[420:08.99]Um...

[421:06.25]Sorry if I caused you any distress with my last message.
[421:09.28]I was only joking.
[421:10.46]I never even worked at a pizzeria, and how would a walk-in oven even work?
[421:14.22]Hope you have a good night.
[421:15.94]See?
[421:16.40]It's been proven that it was just dog shit.
[421:19.30]Thank you, Honey Chain, for the $1.
[421:22.27]S-Dog, man, thanks for the $1.
[421:24.51]I'm bad at meeting people, and I know I'll get sad and sentimental and run back to them.
[421:29.83]I've given them so much, even my old GPU for free.
[421:33.95]But they have no thanks or care for me at all.
[421:35.83]I wish it was easier to find Aussie friends.
[421:38.28]I don't know, man.
[421:43.88]I don't know if these guys sound like very fucking good friends at all.
[421:54.33]Have I not built a lab?
[421:55.25]Oh, I built the whole thing.
[421:55.95]It's already done.
[421:56.37]I already went through it.
[421:57.21]I already broke it.
[422:01.54]Surround yourself with people that you enjoy.
[422:03.60]Mess dog, man.
[422:05.14]For real.
[422:06.78]Your life becomes much easier when you surround yourself with people that make you happy.
[422:11.88]Not the opposite.
[422:18.42]I wish you the best of luck.
[422:22.18]Dubski Dude, thanks for the $1.
[422:23.82]On the topic of competitive games, I know exactly what you mean.
[422:26.92]I watched a YouTube compilation of this guy on Team Fortress getting really mad because his friend was headshotting him over and over with the Huntsman.
[422:35.44]He even said a few swears.
[422:36.58]It was really embarrassing.
[422:39.67]So... Oh, that's the... I know that guy.
[422:46.23]That guy's a real mean guy.
[422:49.01]Thank you, though.
[422:50.65]I really appreciate it.
[422:55.56]Wait, what the fuck?
[422:58.74]Thank you to Dinosaurus Rex for the $1.
[423:02.30]Please show this on stream.
[423:03.63]No, it said how to download a hypercam.
[423:06.09]Unregistered hypercam.
[423:08.21]I'm not going to show that on stream.
[423:09.31]Thank you, Dinosaurus Rex.
[423:11.31]Thank you Sdogman for the $1.
[423:13.15]When we have fun, we're incredible.
[423:14.35]We play like pros and synergize so well, but whenever we are not, it fucking sucks.
[423:22.02]Maybe you should not play Overwatch with them.
[423:27.11]Maybe see if they're into a game that's less stressful.
[423:30.81]Get them into a game that's not so kind of competitive and that requires a ton of brain power and focus and winning.
[423:39.31]Maybe you can play a game with them that's not like that.
[423:45.45]Try something a little more relaxed.
[423:52.20]Something that's not...
[423:55.48]Going to cause anybody problems, right?
[424:00.86]Minecraft.
[424:03.48]Thank you, Wild Omelette for the $1.
[424:05.28]Hey, Jeremy, speaking of pizza, I used to work at a drive-thru pizzeria.
[424:08.37]Do they have any of those in Boston?
[424:09.79]It was pretty cool until a customer drove past the pay window and straight into the drive-in oven.
[424:28.82]Thank you.

[424:31.88]The Chosen June for the two bucks.
[424:34.68]Jeremiah, can you play Final Fantasy IX and give all the characters funny voices?
[424:43.09]I don't know if I'm going to play Final Fantasy.
[424:45.73]It's a great game, but thank you.
[424:47.25]I'm not sure I'll play it on stream.
[424:48.39]Thank you, BroLuck, for the $1.
[424:49.91]Break it, please.
[424:50.65]I'm going to die.
[424:51.97]I'm not going to break the Labo.
[424:53.27]Thank you, MoveMeansMove for the $1.
[424:54.83]If Jeremiah doesn't play Spider-Man 2 on stream...
[424:58.07]Azaz is going to flip.
[424:59.61]Who the fuck is Azaz?
[425:01.37]Darkstar.
[425:01.95]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[425:03.11]You really should watch that butt supercut.
[425:05.09]It's actually quite respectful and tastefully done.
[425:11.88]Thank you, BopBeat, for the $1.
[425:15.50]It's a YouTube link.
[425:16.56]Let's screen it.
[425:19.40]No, it's a Beat Saber with a rat song.
[425:21.50]I'm going to have somebody screen my calls.
[425:27.15]Alright, here it is.
[425:27.93]Beat Saber of the Rat Song.
[425:29.17]Didn't we already watch this?
[425:31.69]Did we watch this already?
[425:35.11]I feel like we did.
[425:37.31]Maybe we didn't, though.
[425:41.42]Let's watch it.
[426:04.15]Okay, that was insane.
[426:10.04]That was a lot more difficult than I thought it was going to be.
[426:11.92]Well, thank you for that.
[426:13.52]Bop beat.
[426:13.98]That was pretty cool.
[426:15.22]Thanks, man.
[426:16.38]That was actually really cool.
[426:20.73]Bathtubbed.
[426:21.73]Thank you for the two bucks.
[426:22.55]Does the stream just keep going if we donate?
[426:24.81]Is that how it works?
[426:25.69]Yes.
[426:27.77]I do not end the stream until I read all the donations.
[426:32.41]Unless stream turns off.
[426:34.81]Comcast turns it off.
[426:37.29]Or I feel like I'm going to puke.
[426:39.31]Only those three things.
[426:42.17]K. Rise.
[426:43.61]K. R. I. S. Thanks for the $1.
[426:45.52]Hey, Jerma, will you ever play the Telltale Walking Dead games?
[426:48.84]I already played them off stream, so I wouldn't be able to give you real reactions or a blind play.
[426:54.08]You know, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[426:56.02]So the answer is probably no.
[426:58.59]Uh, Crimvault, thanks for the one dollar.
[427:01.27]Out of curiosity, back in your tuber days, was it weird to essentially be talking to yourself for videos?
[427:07.99]No.
[427:10.17]Not really.
[427:11.37]Because I knew that I was talking to other people.
[427:15.83]Hey, here's a tip for you guys, streamers and YouTubers, if you want to try and do it.
[427:20.87]Talk like you're talking to somebody in the same room.
[427:23.36]I knew I was talking to other people.
[427:26.30]So it wasn't weird or anything.
[427:30.34]You got to talk like you're talking to somebody.
[427:35.46]But thank you.
[427:36.64]The Reaper of Memes, thanks for $1.
[427:38.10]Don't let him sleep.
[427:39.64]I will thank you.
[427:40.48]Bathtubbed for the $1 here.
[427:43.08]Oh, so that's why I always see the thumbnail of stream over in my following list for two hours.
[427:49.85]I got to fix that, man.
[427:50.91]I got to have like another screen that's like...
[427:54.90]Hey, we're just hanging out or something.
[427:57.91]But thank you, dude.
[427:58.55]Thank you, bro.
[427:59.21]Luck for the $1.

[428:00.83]Break Labo.
[428:01.51]Why are you keeping it in perfect?
[428:03.16]Just recycle it.
[428:06.39]Solomon the Squid, thanks for the $1.
[428:07.91]I need your help.
[428:08.45]I work at a pizzeria and was making some pizzas until I accidentally walked into an oven and locked myself in.
[428:13.23]I only have my phone on me and I have 2% battery life.
[428:16.11]You're the only hope.
[428:17.15]I'm scared.
[428:18.91]Thank you, S-Dog Man, for the $5.45.
[428:23.25]Thank you for your advice, man.
[428:25.43]I want you to know that just having you here and especially the old GTA 4 and stuff videos has helped me and will always help me.
[428:33.08]Thank you, S-Dog Man.
[428:36.02]I would re-evaluate how you hang out with your friends.
[428:40.94]Try some less intense games.
[428:43.70]Oh!
[428:45.78]Verilik just gave $50.05.

[429:15.81]And then rounding it out here, Honey Chain, thank you for the $1.
[429:19.17]Why does Garfield hate Mondays if he doesn't have a job?

[430:57.60]What does Moomins have to say here?
[431:00.69]Hey, last weekend I was at a bar and accidentally bumped into a girl and spilled her drink all over herself.
[431:05.53]I apologized profusely and offered to buy her a replacement drink, but someone bumped into me and I knocked into her.
[431:10.87]This is bullshit.
[431:12.05]I fucking read this last night.
[431:15.67]I, she somehow managed to trip continuously for 45 continuous seconds into the kitchen and fell into the walking oven.
[431:20.83]Anyway, do you know a good lawyer by any chance?
[431:22.63]No, I don't.
[431:23.49]Thank you, Freddy, for the $1.

[433:09.78]People don't want you to be the best.
[433:11.64]It's just that sometimes you struggle with the easy tasks and it's like watching someone with a plunger trying to fix a clogged toilet by pulling the shit out with their hands.
[433:17.96]It's hard to watch sometimes.
[433:20.46]What?
[433:23.64]What are you talking about?
[433:24.76]I built that thing in fucking four hours, and I broke it in one minute.
