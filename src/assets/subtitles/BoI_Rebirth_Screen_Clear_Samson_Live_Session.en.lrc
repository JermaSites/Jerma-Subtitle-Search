[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.41]Here we go.
[00:11.08]Oh man, that was not a good idea.
[00:13.16]I... This is gonna take me, like, five minutes to do this.
[00:21.15]No, actually, I'm... timer.
[00:23.25]Let's see how long it takes me to clear this room, because I kind of have to.
[00:26.03]Because look at all the stuff you get.
[00:29.07]This is ridiculous.
[00:31.89]This is going to take me like 15 minutes to do this, isn't it?
[00:34.91]I don't know.
[00:39.56]Alright, so here we are, guys.
[00:41.76]You want to talk about value of an item early?
[00:45.04]Oh my god.
[00:46.70]If you get card against humanity, and you have a room that is this big, a big room like this, and you go in and you use it...
[00:54.70]I don't even know how much money is on the ground here.
[00:57.50]And how many, like, spirit hearts and evil hearts.
[01:00.48]Like, let's find out.
[01:01.85]Ready?
[01:02.21]Look at the timer, too.
[01:03.61]I only used two bombs.
[01:05.35]This took me, like, seven and a half minutes.
[01:06.97]Let's see.
[01:07.27]Ready?
[01:07.79]Look at the counter.
[01:10.11]There's, like, dimes in here and stuff.
[01:11.85]Like, I'm gonna break the game.
[01:13.33]Can you go past 99?
[01:16.58]Because I'm going to!
[01:17.44]Like, really!
[01:20.28]Hey!
[01:20.42]What is going on, everybody?
[01:21.76]Jirba here with The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.
[01:25.82]This is the reimagining and redoing of The Binding of Isaac.
[01:30.96]It's now on Steam.
[01:32.76]I'm sure you've probably heard of this game by now, it's pretty popular.
[01:36.58]It's become a somewhat cult phenomenon, this game has been over the last couple of years.
[01:42.25]With good reason, because it's fun, it's really interesting, and it has a lot of replayability.
[01:46.53]I think I put somewhere around 100 hours or 200 hours or so into the last Binding of Isaac game.
[01:53.86]And this is not a sequel, so this is just the read- Ooh, already right off the bat, we got Robo Baby.
[02:01.78]So, I really don't think I need to explain what this game is, because a majority of us all know what it is.
[02:08.64]It's just a better version of The Binding of Isaac, with a ton of extra stuff and a bunch more content.
[02:14.16]And I'm playing as Samson, who is an unlockable character.
[02:18.07]who, I don't know if this is a great idea for me to do this or not, because I'm not particularly great with the low-damage characters, but he gets this thing called rage, where the more you hit people, the more you go, and you, uh, see?
[02:29.85]For instance, I'm getting hit already.
[02:32.15]Jerma just talks, and then just gets hit by enemies that are incredibly easy to dodge.
[02:36.53]This needs to happen again.
[02:38.50]I told you.
[02:39.68]Told you.
[02:40.02]Alright, but we're gonna, I'm going for a mom kill here, I'm going for a heart kill.
[02:45.48]And let's hope we can get that in this live session, because that's what this is.
[02:48.36]I'm just recording the game.
[02:50.63]Maybe I'll make a bunch of... I'm... Seriously!
[02:55.68]What is hitting me?
[02:57.10]The fucking fly was right next to me.
[02:58.90]Holy shit.
[03:01.34]Okay.
[03:03.42]I think it's time to, like, lay off the battery acid or whatever the hell is in my water that I'm drinking.
[03:09.13]Seriously.
[03:12.69]Alright, no more messing around.
[03:14.11]I promise you I'm not terrible at this game.
[03:17.93]Although maybe I am.
[03:19.23]I just haven't realized it yet.
[03:20.33]And I need you guys here to be able to tell me that I'm bad at this game.
[03:23.85]No bombs, no keys.
[03:25.93]I'm going to continue to explore, I'm not gonna go in that room just yet.
[03:29.90]And hopefully this video is in 60 frames per second.
[03:32.90]Because that's what I'm recording it at right now.
[03:35.42]This is my first test to see if I can- and this is probably a bad game to do this test with.
[03:41.06]To see if I can record at 60, because this is not a very demanding game.
[03:45.79]So, testing my limits of my computer... ...don't really make much sense with The Binding of Isaac.
[03:53.54]Okay.
[03:54.68]Well, then I can't go to a secret room, don't have any coins, don't have any keys, so we're just gonna have to go to the boss.
[03:59.54]And I might just one-hit die at this boss.
[04:02.36]Actually, wait, hold on a second.
[04:04.56]Hold on just a second here.
[04:06.94]Just a second.
[04:10.02]I can't believe that fly was hitting me.
[04:12.30]I really can't believe it.
[04:14.30]Famine.
[04:14.66]Alright, time to be quiet.
[04:16.10]Because Jerma can't talk and play games at the same time.
[04:22.70]This guy's not bad.
[04:24.00]He just spawns the flies.
[04:24.96]And I've got technology, baby.
[04:28.28]So this should go fairly well.
[04:29.74]And I have rage!
[04:30.94]As you can see, my character is getting even angrier at the situation at hand.
[04:35.02]So he does more damage.
[04:37.62]And there we go.
[04:38.24]Okay.
[04:40.26]Things are back on track, as they say.
[04:43.00]And I got the bandage, which, if you remember from the last game, this is the Super Meat Boy equivalent of it being Bandage Girl.
[04:52.37]Let's go.
[04:56.43]Spiders.
[04:57.15]Spiders!
[04:58.40]Damn it.
[05:00.58]When I play this game, I feel like I need to have a swear jar.
[05:03.42]Because when I'm not recording, if that just happened right there, I would have been like, fuck!
[05:09.52]So I need to open up a swear jar fund.
[05:12.50]Donate it to charity or something.
[05:15.48]What's going on?
[05:16.30]What the fuck is happening right now?
[05:19.52]What is going on?
[05:21.97]What the hell was that?
[05:24.02]You so... Alright, that was odd.
[05:26.84]Why did my game just speed up by like three times?
[05:32.28]Ooh.
[05:33.56]I will take that money.
[05:37.34]I really don't know what the hell was that.
[05:40.08]I'm gonna like... Watch that back and probably throw up.
[05:46.69]Don't get hit by the easiest enemy.
[05:49.21]Come on now.
[05:51.40]Secret room could be up there, but I'm not gonna do it just yet.
[05:54.13]I wanna see what else I potentially can do in these other rooms.
[06:00.89]Okay.
[06:02.53]I like how I can see how long this video is so far.
[06:04.66]Four minutes, alright.
[06:06.44]Speed it up.
[06:07.10]Let's go.
[06:07.44]We gotta get to Mom's heart in like ten minutes.
[06:11.80]It's not gonna happen.
[06:14.25]I do want to keep those guys locked in over on the right, because I don't want to open that up.
[06:18.24]Because once that opens... The other guy will run out and make my day very, very bad.
[06:22.40]And I don't want a bad day.
[06:23.88]I want a good day.
[06:26.16]Damn it.
[06:28.28]Can that go through rocks?
[06:30.00]No, I guess not.
[06:32.32]I guess not.
[06:34.77]Okay, you are now free.
[06:35.83]I have 99 bombs.
[06:36.99]What are you doing?
[06:38.37]Just blow them up.
[06:42.82]Did I, like, forget that?
[06:43.94]I had 99 bombs.
[06:44.84]You know, I thought for a second, because I was talking, I thought that was the blast damage one, not the actual 99 bombs one.
[06:51.40]But that should get rid of all of them.
[06:52.94]It does.
[06:54.60]Alright, secret room hunt time.
[06:56.67]I'm gonna say it's right here.
[06:59.59]Nope, I was wrong.
[07:00.75]Nope.
[07:02.05]It must be down here.
[07:02.71]I don't know, actually.
[07:09.07]It's happening again!
[07:10.98]What is going on?
[07:13.36]Why is my cave doing that?
[07:17.40]Do I have, like, some messed up item that's doing this?
[07:21.22]I have technology.
[07:23.46]I have the Samson Rage, the bombs, and the bandage.
[07:31.59]Something's going on here.
[07:33.35]Something is aloof.
[07:34.51]Because I don't have an answer to that.
[07:42.17]Ah!
[07:44.86]Help!
[07:49.04]I don't know how to stop this!
[07:50.22]What is going on?
[07:57.38]It's still going!
[08:02.34]I don't know what to do!
[08:05.04]You know what I think is actually going on right now, guys?
[08:08.15]Because the game's running at 120 frames, it's now back down to 60.
[08:12.15]It is speeding my game up when my frames per second go up.
[08:18.33]What on Earth?
[08:21.23]That happening at random times during when I need to dodge some of these harder boss fights is not gonna be good.
[08:28.03]It's not gonna be great.
[08:30.85]It actually might get me killed.
[08:33.89]But, whatever, we're just going to let it just do that, I guess.
[08:40.57]We'll see if it happens again.
[08:42.69]I'm gonna assume it's gonna happen again, because why wouldn't it?
[08:44.77]It's happened like four times now.
[08:47.93]Damn it.
[08:51.28]I can't whistle.
[08:52.38]Fun fact, guys, I don't know how to whistle.
[08:54.72]I've tried to learn many times, and it just never has happened.
[08:59.67]What is this?
[09:00.29]Matchbook?
[09:01.94]Evil Up.
[09:03.48]Okay.
[09:05.14]So from my understanding, the evil stat in this game is the more evil you have, the more chance you're going to spawn a devil room, I believe.
[09:14.99]I think.
[09:15.21]Let me just take a sip of my iced coffee, and then maybe I'll figure it out that way.
[09:20.84]Ah, yep, it's Eb.
[09:21.72]The more evil you have, the devil runes will spawn more, or something.
[09:27.22]And I guess you can get evil points by doing evil things.
[09:30.85]Like if you blow up the beggar, I think that gives you evil points.
[09:35.07]These are just things, I don't know.
[09:36.77]There's a whole lot of secrets in this game, as all of us are aware.
[09:41.44]And, I don't know, like 75,000% of them.
[09:45.16]I only know a few things.
[09:45.98]I don't have very much stuff unlocked.
[09:48.74]I have... I think I've only beaten the game, like, three or four times.
[09:52.48]And now we're in super fast, super speed mode.
[09:56.38]And... what do I want?
[09:56.98]No, I'm gonna blow both these so I can get... the... key.
[10:02.45]I apologize if that's, like, off-putting.
[10:05.43]Maybe it's because I'm recording in 60 frames a second or something.
[10:12.25]Maybe, you know what?
[10:12.75]I'm gonna... hold on a second.
[10:13.70]I'm gonna try to, like, fix this...
[10:16.76]60, what happens if you record a 60 frames per second video on YouTube and then it goes to 30 frames per second halfway through the video?
[10:23.62]Is that gonna like break, is my like channel gonna explode?
[10:26.54]I have no idea.
[10:29.20]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[10:30.14]Okay, I think I figured it out.
[10:34.06]Yeah, I definitely figured it out.
[10:35.05]I think we're good now.
[10:37.59]If it happens again, I'm not sure what to say about this.
[10:43.59]I hate spiders, I hate spiders.
[10:48.19]I don't want to waste this run, though, because these items aren't that bad.
[10:50.83]Having the bandage... And here's a little trick.
[10:54.99]Here's a little tip about the bandage that I haven't really been talking about, I haven't really even been doing.
[10:59.33]It does a ton of damage if you touch people with it.
[11:02.73]I've kind of been scared to do it in this run, because I've been talking and trying to introduce the video and saying hello and everything.
[11:08.35]But if you can get close enough to somebody and touch them with the bandage, it is ridiculous damage.
[11:14.50]See if I can do it here without, like, instantly dying.
[11:19.08]And, no, I'm not going that close to these guys.
[11:21.28]Forget that.
[11:23.84]I'll do it on the next boss.
[11:25.10]Whatever the next boss is, you will see the super bandage powers.
[11:30.66]And I only have one bandage.
[11:31.92]So it is very, very good.
[11:36.26]What's in the chest?
[11:37.54]Ooh, P.O.'
[11:38.33]'s here!
[11:39.89]Great, luck done.
[11:41.71]Here's another thing I've noticed about this game.
[11:44.54]I feel like pills, I've gotten a lot of pills that are just awful.
[11:48.26]And I know that cane from the last, is anything, what is going, come on.
[11:51.14]Hit somebody.
[11:51.64]Come on, you gotta do like the arcing of the bullets.
[11:55.63]Here we go.
[11:57.09]But I feel like there's so many bad pills in the game.
[12:00.37]Maybe I'm just having bad luck, but I... Maybe like 40% of every pill I've taken has not been terrible.
[12:08.66]I'd say 60% has been bad.
[12:12.56]Ooh.
[12:13.62]Maybe even more than that.
[12:15.18]Double shot, I'm okay with that.
[12:18.20]I wish it worked for the familiar, too.
[12:19.40]That'd be cool.
[12:20.90]How many coins do I have?
[12:23.57]Enough to justify opening the store?
[12:26.61]Probably not, but I have so many bombs that I'm not using.
[12:30.54]I need to just blow up all the secret room potential areas.
[12:33.94]Okay, got some keys.
[12:36.98]So the video still should be in 60 FPS, by the way.
[12:40.87]I'm pretty sure I figured out that problem.
[12:44.74]I figured it out.
[12:45.32]I used my science, and I figured it out.
[12:49.45]Come on, come on, come on.
[12:50.57]Oh, you're these enemies.
[12:51.49]I forgot.
[12:54.05]Open.
[12:55.89]No!
[13:00.40]And these guys don't stop shooting either.
[13:03.66]Which really stinks.
[13:06.42]Almost just got hit by that.
[13:07.28]That would have been embarrassing.
[13:10.06]That would have been embarrassing.
[13:11.32]Wouldn't it have been?
[13:15.31]So, funny thing about 60 FPS.
[13:17.81]I, like, haven't even watched any 60 FPS videos because I have Firefox.
[13:21.66]And it, like, doesn't work in Firefox yet.
[13:24.70]And I've just been, like, too lazy to open up, like, Internet Explorer.
[13:28.29]Talk about, like, a lazy bastard, huh?
[13:30.96]Oh, 60 FPS videos on YouTube.
[13:34.18]I bet that's cool looking.
[13:36.16]But I just, I don't want, I gotta reach my arm over and click on Internet Explorer or Chrome.
[13:42.36]That's just too much work for me.
[13:44.13]My hand's gonna get tired.
[13:47.03]But I will look at it now.
[13:50.91]Is it on, like, iPad?
[13:51.99]I've watched videos on iPad.
[13:54.57]Like, in my bed, just chilling out.
[13:57.31]And I don't know if I've noticed a difference.
[13:59.89]Maybe I've just been tired.
[14:02.57]Or it's HD only, right?
[14:04.09]Isn't that one of the stipulations of using it?
[14:06.27]It's only HD?
[14:08.33]Screw it, we're going in.
[14:09.03]I have eight keys, who cares?
[14:12.74]We're gonna donate some.
[14:13.90]We're gonna go to... whatever.
[14:18.61]I'm going to go to 115.
[14:19.33]Because I'm not going to get the necessary coins to be able to get that, which is what I want.
[14:26.03]Give me these pills.
[14:27.46]I don't even care.
[14:28.82]I fought it.
[14:30.26]Hooray.
[14:36.44]Let's go.
[14:39.30]The dark one.
[14:40.00]I don't think I've ever fought this.
[14:40.89]No, it's the first time I think I've ever seen this guy.
[14:43.31]No idea what he does.
[14:45.34]Actually, no, maybe I have seen this guy.
[14:47.60]We'll find out if I can ever... No, absolutely, I definitely haven't seen this before.
[14:50.81]Because I can't see anything.
[14:53.25]This guy's new.
[14:55.05]Shit.
[14:58.77]Here comes the dark.
[15:03.46]I love this double shot.
[15:04.94]Hopefully I get something cool to add on to this.
[15:07.22]Because the amount of modifiers that they put in this game... And look, that stupid item that's in the store came over here.
[15:13.31]I don't want Mom's coin purse.
[15:14.97]It's a bunch of, like, garbage pills that I don't need.
[15:18.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought that was the same one!
[15:21.17]I thought that was the same pill.
[15:24.78]Alright, come on, I've had all bad ones.
[15:26.90]Give me a good one.
[15:28.74]There we go.
[15:29.60]Okay.
[15:31.78]Hmm, super secret room, I don't know.
[15:33.92]I forget the criteria of super- It's been a long time since I've played Isaac.
[15:41.30]Isn't the super secret room has to be connected to one room or something like that?
[15:44.00]Or one door?
[15:46.42]We're just going to go with regular secret rooms for now.
[15:49.90]I'm not going to get that coin.
[15:51.04]It'll kill me.
[15:52.96]It'll just kill me.
[15:57.22]That's that room done.
[15:58.28]What do we got for time?
[15:59.52]Oh, 14 minutes!
[16:01.04]This video is going to be like an hour and 15 minutes long.
[16:05.39]Fuck it, let's just go in.
[16:09.74]Well, I don't have a spacebar item.
[16:13.53]So I'm going to use one.
[16:15.55]And just use it right there.
[16:16.51]Because it only takes one room to recharge anyways.
[16:18.97]Which is another thing I'm happy that they did.
[16:20.87]And damn it, I got stuck on the thing over down there.
[16:24.98]The recharging of items is a lot more clear in this game.
[16:28.96]It's actually just the number of rooms you have to clear.
[16:31.52]So on the top left, I just have one bar there.
[16:33.38]That means one room needs to be cleared.
[16:35.80]And of course, depending on if you have any of the, like, the battery or, like, the 9 volts and stuff to be able to reduce your charge rate, I'm sure that affects it as well.
[16:45.86]This guy's giving me a real pain in the ass.
[16:49.12]Faith up.
[16:50.58]Bible tract.
[16:53.41]I don't know what this does.
[16:54.15]I'm pretty sure this just is faith up.
[16:57.13]So that means I have a better chance of finding angel rooms.
[17:01.46]I still don't know.
[17:02.62]Petrified poo.
[17:03.42]Is this... Lucky.
[17:04.42]You're just more lucky.
[17:05.10]I don't know.
[17:07.08]Feel free to scream at me in the comments if what I just did was stupid and left that there.
[17:11.36]Oh, dear.
[17:13.16]Oh, boy.
[17:13.82]Oh, boy.
[17:15.89]Double mega tears.
[17:19.71]That's so cool.
[17:20.53]Alright.
[17:24.45]Let's continue.
[17:25.13]This is doing a lot of damage.
[17:29.46]I forgot to show you the bandage thing.
[17:31.34]Well, I'll do that.
[17:32.30]This is what I do, I just forget things.
[17:40.14]To the right.
[17:41.72]Secret room actually might be right here.
[17:42.96]I'm gonna assume it could be, right?
[17:46.84]Hooray!
[17:49.51]Just a regular chest.
[17:51.55]Got the bomb back and a coin.
[17:54.07]Okay.
[17:55.41]Sure thing.
[17:56.63]I'm gonna go in here too.
[17:57.49]Because that requires two keys to open.
[18:00.92]I don't want this.
[18:01.62]I don't want this.
[18:02.08]I'm pretty sure this is going... No, I don't want that.
[18:05.14]The dice room?
[18:06.00]That one dice?
[18:08.00]I... It... Every time I've done that, it has randomized every item that I currently have.
[18:13.30]So I don't want to do it.
[18:14.89]Because I like this setup.
[18:15.83]This is actually pretty good right now.
[18:17.51]This is a lot of damage.
[18:20.39]And it could it can only get better from here if I get like tears up or something, so I'm gonna let it be Let's go have enough bombs to get it might as well go get it right let's let's be go-getters a Heart yeah was not worth it I Don't want to die from that Open
[18:47.68]These enemies are so annoying, because you have to wait till they walk at you and open.
[18:53.60]That guy.
[18:54.64]I wonder how much damage I'm actually doing.
[18:56.46]Actually, the Gertie will be a really good showcase of the bandage.
[19:00.39]So, so ready?
[19:01.17]I'll show it to you.
[19:01.95]Once I can clear this stuff out.
[19:03.79]Alright, watch this.
[19:04.37]Ready?
[19:04.63]Check out the bandage.
[19:07.10]Hold on.
[19:07.68]Hold on.
[19:08.28]Hold on.
[19:08.66]Hold on.
[19:09.40]I'll get it.
[19:09.74]I don't know.
[19:11.34]The hitbox of this is kind of weird.
[19:12.82]I need to get to a place where... Like, right... Look at that.
[19:17.09]See?
[19:17.25]I didn't even touch him.
[19:18.53]That's just the bandage doing that.
[19:20.87]Alright, I took enough damage for you to see that.
[19:22.25]So if you're, like, good at the game and you can't, like... You can avoid damage... That is a huge deal.
[19:29.95]I just took, like, seven points of damage to show that to you.
[19:33.26]And a lot of you probably already knew that was a thing, so... Whoops.
[19:35.88]Whoops.
[19:38.07]Devil room.
[19:40.81]What?
[19:41.53]Did you just teleport me to the same room?
[19:44.43]Okay.
[19:46.01]Good.
[19:47.31]And two troll bombs.
[19:51.09]I got what I needed out of there.
[19:52.73]Anything else?
[19:53.21]I could go down.
[19:54.57]You know what?
[19:54.91]Screw it.
[19:55.25]We're gonna go down.
[19:56.01]We're gonna be completionists.
[19:59.12]Well, not technically, but sort of.
[20:02.38]What's down there?
[20:02.84]What have I not seen?
[20:04.64]Could just be a regular room.
[20:07.77]I don't want to die.
[20:08.49]Because seriously, Samson.
[20:11.39]I'm building up such ridiculous damage.
[20:13.03]Holy shit.
[20:18.12]I'm one-hitting every enemy.
[20:21.56]I don't know what this is.
[20:22.92]What is this?
[20:24.42]I'm scared to... Don't you even think about it, fire.
[20:29.02]I'm scared.
[20:30.38]Cursed.
[20:31.60]Guppy's tail.
[20:35.53]I don't know what that does.
[20:39.26]I don't know.
[20:40.20]I could just go, like, Wikipedia this right now.
[20:43.04]But what's the fun in that?
[20:44.46]I want to find out.
[20:45.36]I want to have it be a surprise.
[20:47.04]Okay.
[20:51.05]Let's go.
[20:52.13]Already wasted enough time in the first, like, two or three areas.
[20:54.89]Let's just keep going.
[20:57.91]Up, up, and away.
[21:00.81]And into the next tier of dungeons.
[21:07.14]Where are we?
[21:09.08]The depth's level one.
[21:10.50]Welcome, young Samson.
[21:15.30]Technology baby can shoot through those.
[21:17.72]So we are per- D'oh!
[21:22.91]Come on, get him!
[21:24.89]You weakling!
[21:27.11]Use your super techno powers and shoot his face off.
[21:29.73]Good.
[21:30.69]Good job.
[21:33.33]Missing page.
[21:41.78]I don't know.
[21:42.30]The thing with the trinkets is I always forget what the trinkets do.
[21:46.60]Shit.
[21:49.38]All the trinkets and relics and stuff, I just never remember what they are.
[21:52.24]I could have the stupidest, worst trinket in the game.
[21:55.12]And I don't even know it.
[21:57.58]There's somebody in the comments right now probably like, No!
[22:00.82]No!
[22:02.64]And I can't even hear you.
[22:04.56]I can't hear you.
[22:05.22]You're going to have to scream louder.
[22:06.56]I can't hear you.
[22:08.49]There you go.
[22:09.07]Now I can hear you.
[22:14.06]But this run looks like it's going to be pretty good.
[22:17.99]Considering.
[22:23.01]I want this.
[22:24.27]I want Bob's rotten head.
[22:27.27]So I can go like this.
[22:30.91]Now I have to wait three rooms for the charge again.
[22:32.82]That was not worth it.
[22:33.56]I should just be dropping bombs everywhere.
[22:37.48]Really.
[22:37.96]Just put them all over the place.
[22:39.76]There's no reason not to.
[22:40.56]I have a million of them.
[22:43.31]Getting confused by these skulls.
[22:46.91]Open.
[22:48.33]You fucker!
[22:52.79]You... Okay, I need to be careful, because I have a tendency, I'm one of those people when I play Isaac, to totally lose total control, and it all falls apart.
[23:04.59]It happens to me quite frequently.
[23:05.85]I'll have a cool build, I'll have something going on, I'll be like, oh, it's just going good.
[23:09.95]And then I'll take, like, a couple points of damage in the same room, and then it all falls apart, and I die, like, in the next room.
[23:15.59]And I don't want that to happen, because I'm recording this.
[23:19.07]And I don't want to get embarrassed.
[23:20.35]What do you think?
[23:24.18]Should I wait for the item?
[23:25.42]Actually, I know, I already... Eh.
[23:27.90]We'll wait.
[23:29.06]It might be a better use of these.
[23:30.14]Holy shit, this room has a lot of people in it.
[23:33.08]There could be better use of that key.
[23:34.46]And there is already.
[23:36.05]Good thing I didn't do it.
[23:36.71]Because that would have been kind of a waste.
[23:40.11]Kind of.
[23:44.05]Excuse me.
[23:45.51]Don't step on the goo on the ground.
[23:51.38]And you're done too.
[23:53.26]Alright.
[23:53.76]Let's get another item.
[23:56.90]A lot of actives.
[23:58.06]I've been not getting anything to help this build out with the double huge super shot.
[24:04.82]But this is very good too.
[24:07.27]You put a coin in and it like does all your damage pretty much.
[24:10.33]It shakes the screen.
[24:12.67]Hits everybody in the room for one coin.
[24:15.93]Like this.
[24:16.31]Ready?
[24:16.97]Poink.
[24:17.43]Just did it.
[24:18.43]Okay.
[24:19.03]Yeah.
[24:20.64]If I lose, there's no way I lose.
[24:23.62]I can clear every room.
[24:25.55]No matter what, watch this.
[24:26.61]I'm gonna open this door.
[24:28.29]Oh, you're all dead.
[24:29.13]Bye.
[24:30.39]See ya.
[24:32.81]Thanks for the coin.
[24:37.98]Okay.
[24:39.10]I wish I knew what this stuff does.
[24:40.34]I need to play more Isaac so I know what things do.
[24:45.78]And there's something up here too.
[24:46.74]No, I'm leaving that there.
[24:48.30]That's absolutely staying there.
[24:52.55]We're gonna leave these...
[24:55.77]I am also not going to use the store room anymore, because I want to keep these coins, so I can clear whole rooms in one second.
[25:06.38]That would be good to do.
[25:09.14]I think.
[25:09.54]I'll open it.
[25:12.04]Come on, give me another, give me my key back.
[25:13.34]Nice.
[25:14.32]And that's what we call value right there.
[25:16.08]That is total value.
[25:19.88]I want to save my keys.
[25:20.78]I'm not, forget the item room.
[25:23.28]Hold on to my keys and let's just keep going.
[25:28.29]It's always those little turkey guys that screw me up.
[25:33.81]I know what this does.
[25:34.63]This, I believe, if you take damage, is a chance to turn you into Pac-Man.
[25:38.83]So you better believe I'm holding on to it.
[25:40.82]I don't care how bad it is.
[25:42.48]I mean, you're going to mention Pac-Man?
[25:47.42]I'm keeping it, dude.
[25:48.14]You think I'm going to trash this item?
[25:51.56]Never.
[25:52.30]I will never trash it.
[25:55.07]A bow secret room could be right here.
[25:56.89]It probably is right here.
[26:00.60]No.
[26:01.82]So where is it?
[26:02.84]Down here?
[26:10.77]Forget it.
[26:11.43]No, I need that secret room.
[26:13.15]Because the amount of coins I have is very, very big deal.
[26:17.71]Very important.
[26:19.97]So I have to open it, like, please tell me I'm gonna hit it if I open it right here.
[26:24.17]Shit.
[26:24.61]Well, I have plenty of bombs.
[26:25.75]Maybe I'll hit it if I do it like that.
[26:27.99]Shit.
[26:28.91]What if I do two bombs?
[26:30.95]Damn it.
[26:32.05]Fuck.
[26:32.89]Alright, so it's obviously not right there.
[26:34.93]So that means it must be over here.
[26:37.87]Actually, I should blow these up, too.
[26:39.41]Because there's stuff in these.
[26:42.23]Yeah, there's one right there.
[26:44.47]That is a evil heart.
[26:47.94]which if you don't know what these things do, when that heart is consumed, it's the same thing as a spirit heart, it will do damage to everything in the whole room.
[26:55.86]There it is.
[26:58.32]And it's two keys, which means I'm probably gonna go open those chests, or at least one of them, because then I have an extra key.
[27:06.74]Or maybe I'll just open the door.
[27:07.82]I don't know.
[27:09.00]That's the beauty of Isaac.
[27:10.96]You could, there's so many different options.
[27:14.10]Like, which one do I do?
[27:15.37]Which do I pick?
[27:18.74]Do I open?
[27:19.18]Yeah, we're just opening this.
[27:19.94]And then we're gonna go in here.
[27:20.62]I'm gonna attack the boss.
[27:23.04]Lots of items.
[27:23.74]I wonder... Let's see what happens if I do this.
[27:26.60]Not worth it.
[27:27.94]It's not doing that much damage.
[27:28.94]I'm doing so much damage with these tiers anyway, so... Not worth doing the active item in this room, at least.
[27:36.86]And spray.
[27:38.68]Jump down here.
[27:40.88]And do the spray again.
[27:41.74]No?
[27:41.90]You're gonna jump... Yeah, I think you only spray from to the side.
[27:44.20]Yeah.
[27:44.66]No.
[27:45.30]Maybe.
[27:46.35]Probably.
[27:46.67]But it doesn't matter.
[27:47.17]You're dead.
[27:49.64]What am I going to get?
[27:50.12]What am I going to get?
[27:51.92]Oh boy.
[27:54.00]Damage up.
[27:58.29]Can I have Q?
[27:58.79]Actually, Q the Fool.
[27:59.75]Let's do it.
[28:02.93]I was kind of hoping it was going to teleport me into the item room.
[28:06.19]Just because I wouldn't have to spend a key to get in there and there might be something in there that I want.
[28:12.64]But, nope.
[28:16.25]One of these times I'm gonna do that, and I'm gonna walk over it and get hurt, and you're gonna hear me scream.
[28:24.42]Okay, let's go in.
[28:26.72]This is the part, at this point, this is where Mom... is.
[28:33.43]So... I wonder if we're going to... Goodbye, whole room.
[28:38.83]I wasn't even gonna think to deal with that room, no way.
[28:42.41]Can forget that room.
[28:45.44]48-hour energy, just gives you a battery.
[28:50.62]No, we're not dealing with this room either.
[28:51.84]Alright, do I try to get some coins?
[28:57.16]Let's- I'm gonna bring this down to 10.
[28:59.92]Okay, give me this coin.
[29:01.06]Come on.
[29:02.00]I need this.
[29:03.23]You fuck.
[29:05.03]And now we're just gonna take out the whole room.
[29:07.79]Didn't get my coins, but I will get probably one or two here.
[29:10.57]No, I didn't even mean to pick that up.
[29:12.31]Shit.
[29:12.61]Because I need-
[29:16.18]Well, that's not cool.
[29:17.80]I really didn't want to pick that up.
[29:19.46]But I did.
[29:20.46]Because I'm a klutz.
[29:23.54]Hey, look, another room I don't want to deal with.
[29:25.36]Okay, so we won't deal with it.
[29:27.92]You see how awesome this item really is?
[29:31.24]It's just you pay one coin to destroy everything.
[29:35.62]Don't think I need to do it here.
[29:36.96]And plus, I want to hold on to that for the womb.
[29:39.57]Because there are some really awful rooms in the room.
[29:42.27]So from now on, conserve my financials.
[29:47.76]Conserve.
[29:48.52]Actually, I still might be able to get the, uh, benefit from the... Heaven Heart.
[29:53.31]Or the... Good Heart, whatever you want to call it.
[29:57.85]Smart Fly.
[29:58.39]Revenge Fly.
[29:58.99]I believe if I take damage, this thing goes after, uh, enemies in the room.
[30:03.61]Is that alright?
[30:04.07]Pretty cool.
[30:04.69]Don't want to do that yet.
[30:10.70]We've got more stuff to explore.
[30:15.50]Like this room!
[30:17.50]With the bone people.
[30:20.18]Get out of here, you bone people.
[30:24.18]So many bombs.
[30:26.16]I just don't know what to do with them all.
[30:29.10]I wish I could trade the technology baby for something.
[30:33.84]Because he's kind of... I mean, he's doing a little bit of work, but not even close to the amount of work that that massage machine is doing.
[30:43.93]Oh, we're gonna hold the coins.
[30:45.77]No reason to do it.
[30:51.20]Secret room.
[30:53.18]I wonder.
[30:55.16]No.
[30:57.22]Maybe down here.
[30:59.26]Maybe?
[31:00.68]Nope.
[31:03.08]Maybe down here.
[31:03.82]Another one of these trolly type rooms.
[31:10.24]Excuse me.
[31:10.92]What is this guy still doing standing here?
[31:14.78]Come on, give me a chance to shoot you.
[31:16.40]Not fair.
[31:19.27]Well, I'm not entirely sure.
[31:22.49]Maybe if I go in the... Item?
[31:25.90]No, did I check this?
[31:27.52]I already did check that, didn't I?
[31:29.42]Yeah, and it wasn't there.
[31:31.92]So it must be somewhere down here.
[31:36.28]Watch out!
[31:39.41]Eh, don't think so.
[31:40.33]No.
[31:42.79]Mmm...
[31:45.56]up here spending a lot of time trying to find the secret room when I should just I should just go to mom greed this is amazing by the way guys just realized how awesome it was for me to find greed right there because look at all these coins I have now look at the amount of times I'm gonna be able to use oh boy I'm just gonna walk in and just totally roll rooms in the in the womb no one's gonna even hurt me nobody will hurt me once
[32:15.23]In the womb.
[32:16.35]That's a bold statement to make, but what is going on here?
[32:19.39]These are the guys that disappear, right?
[32:21.63]They have stealth.
[32:24.23]And another heart.
[32:25.17]I'm just gonna pick it up because it doesn't matter.
[32:27.17]I'm already gonna get a completed one.
[32:28.47]Okay.
[32:32.64]Time to go.
[32:33.04]I have a ton of confidence in this run.
[32:38.38]A ton.
[32:39.26]Can you hear it in my voice?
[32:42.76]I mean, we're talking 60 frames per second.
[32:45.78]We're talking 60 FPS here, guys.
[32:48.96]That's how much confidence I have.
[32:50.58]I'm uploading in 60 frames a second.
[32:53.98]Here's Mom.
[32:56.18]Hello, Mother.
[32:59.02]Whoa.
[33:00.85]Everything's, like, blue.
[33:02.11]Oh, Pac-Man!
[33:03.17]Oh, yeah!
[33:04.47]Oh, my God, lookit.
[33:05.23]Pac-Man's doing so good.
[33:08.15]That run was just saved by Pac-Man.
[33:11.75]There it is.
[33:14.93]Please give me coins.
[33:18.09]Ace of spades.
[33:21.01]No, no, no, nobody's gonna give me coins.
[33:25.15]I'm gonna keep Pac-Man, because this kind of is like an oh shit button.
[33:28.33]Even though I don't activate it, it's still, it's just like, oh shit, it's okay, you're Pac-Man.
[33:33.39]Here we go.
[33:35.68]Here.
[33:36.22]We.
[33:36.78]Go.
[33:38.43]We are now entering the womb.
[33:41.43]And I didn't pick up Q the Fool again, which is dumb, but watch this, guys.
[33:44.35]Oh, hey, ha ha.
[33:45.97]What?
[33:46.49]Oh, it's because they're not... their heads aren't out.
[33:48.39]Okay.
[33:49.91]I just wasted two coins.
[33:50.84]That was really stupid.
[33:51.60]I didn't even need to use them.
[33:52.46]I just got scared.
[33:57.20]Hello, room.
[33:59.06]Goodbye, room.
[34:02.64]I probably said I wasn't going to take damage in this womb.
[34:06.53]Well, that almost just wasn't true.
[34:08.07]Goodbye.
[34:10.19]Hey, look!
[34:13.05]Look at me!
[34:14.47]Hi!
[34:14.77]Ooh, wow, those guys had a lot of health.
[34:18.71]Oh, look, a room full of shit!
[34:20.13]No, not anymore.
[34:22.75]This is amazing.
[34:25.26]This item is so good.
[34:32.26]It's so good!
[34:33.09]Oh, why is my game lagging?
[34:38.11]I'm lagging!
[34:39.25]No, not at this time.
[34:40.07]I'm doing such a great run.
[34:41.67]I hope my computer doesn't crash.
[34:45.51]Man.
[34:48.58]Goodbye.
[34:49.64]Let's just go.
[34:51.00]Screw it, right?
[34:51.78]I mean, why not?
[34:54.20]Screw it, let's just go!
[34:55.22]We're gonna beat the game, like, in the next five minutes.
[35:00.95]I don't even have any tears up or anything.
[35:03.61]But I'm gonna just blow through this.
[35:06.93]Yeah, my only concern is when we get to the heart.
[35:11.65]And there's a devil room.
[35:14.01]I wonder what's in there.
[35:17.67]Couple of keys.
[35:21.92]Uhhh, is that...
[35:25.30]Ah, I don't.
[35:26.58]You know what, I'm not gonna risk it, because I know this is a familiar, but I don't know what this is.
[35:32.28]And frankly, right now, the familiars, I don't even care about the familiars, because my tears do so much damage, and I have the massage machine thing, so I don't think it matters.
[35:40.06]I'm not gonna waste a heart where it's not necessarily... where it's not necessarily.
[35:44.92]Let's go.
[35:46.42]Speedrun.
[35:49.03]You guys want to talk about a speedrun?
[35:50.75]I mean, come on, speedrun right now.
[35:53.27]32 minutes.
[35:53.97]We're talking about a speedrun.
[35:57.81]Lust.
[36:00.39]And you are gone.
[36:03.17]Don't know what this does.
[36:04.59]Are you a wizard?
[36:05.27]No, I'm not.
[36:07.96]But this only lasts, I believe, like a minute or so.
[36:11.44]Or a room or two.
[36:13.78]So I'm okay with this.
[36:17.15]Actually, I hope it wears off.
[36:18.65]You know what?
[36:20.21]I don't... I don't... I don't... Thank goodness you blocked that fly.
[36:25.42]Or maybe it was the bandage.
[36:28.28]This guy's taking a lot of damage.
[36:30.98]Jeez!
[36:33.18]Oh, that's because he's like a mini-boss.
[36:36.60]Finally it wore off.
[36:40.50]Right when we get to the boss, I'm going right in, guys.
[36:43.12]I'm not wasting any time, because I might be able to get this to... One of the harder places.
[36:50.66]Which would be cool.
[36:52.45]See you later.
[36:54.81]And we also... Another damage up.
[36:56.55]Holy shit.
[36:57.95]I must be at max damage.
[37:00.13]There's no way I wouldn't be.
[37:03.94]I love how you can just do that.
[37:07.10]Hey, you ever play, like, the game Binding of Isaac before?
[37:09.74]Just press the spacebar with coins.
[37:12.40]With damage up items.
[37:14.30]And you win the game.
[37:15.18]Whoa, whoa, that didn't happen instantly.
[37:18.54]I thought they were all gonna die.
[37:23.21]Got my coins up again, which is good.
[37:28.69]Don't even want to deal with you.
[37:32.65]Don't want to deal with you.
[37:36.58]Don't want to deal with this room either.
[37:37.86]See ya.
[37:39.41]But I do want this chest.
[37:42.25]I would be singing a totally different tune, guys, if... Yeah, I don't wanna screw that.
[37:49.15]I would be singing a completely different tune if I didn't have this item.
[37:54.46]And look at all these coins!
[37:58.40]They want me to win!
[38:01.24]They want me to win this.
[38:06.36]The Binding of Isaac gods have determined that I'm going to win.
[38:10.16]That's what they've decided today.
[38:13.80]We're just gonna go.
[38:14.40]Let's go, mom's heart.
[38:18.46]Oh, hey, look guys, I'm playing the game.
[38:27.35]Oh, we don't have an opportunity to go to one of the other places.
[38:33.07]Like heaven or the chest or whatever.
[38:36.33]Or shale?
[38:37.01]Shale?
[38:37.63]How is it pronounced?
[38:39.53]But yeah, that's, what is it, 35 minutes?
[38:41.73]That's not that bad.
[38:44.75]Not bad for a beginner.
