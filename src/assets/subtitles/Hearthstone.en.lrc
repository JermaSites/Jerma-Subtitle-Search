[00:01.61]Holy shit.
[00:03.35]Nightbot caught that.
[00:05.15]I didn't even press the button yet.
[00:09.37]Nightbot had my tweet come up before it was pushed through to Twitter.
[00:17.71]That's kind of odd.
[00:21.27]Hey, but how are you?
[00:23.39]How are you?
[00:24.82]How are you doing?
[00:25.76]Good.
[00:31.11]I'm good too.
[00:34.99]Hearthstone, are you sure about this?
[00:36.33]I bet you didn't fucking think you could see this.
[00:41.95]It's alright.
[00:43.93]We actually talked last night.
[00:45.27]This is, hold on, there's a story here.
[00:48.11]A long one.
[00:50.61]This will take about 40 seconds.
[00:52.14]It's a long story.
[01:00.79]Okay, you ready?
[01:01.39]Just making sure you're ready.
[01:03.71]Story is, uh, people were making fun of me last night because of how bad I am at the game.
[01:09.87]Like, we talked about how Hearthstone I played in bed, and they said, you suck, you're terrible, you're so bad.
[01:15.47]And I was like, fucking, I know.
[01:18.18]So, I figured it'd be fun if, uh, you helped me.
[01:25.72]So that's what we're gonna do.
[01:28.28]The new expansion came out.
[01:31.02]And chat is going to be my smart click lifeline.
[01:37.40]This is completely, yeah, this is totally legal backseating.
[01:42.60]I am at Chicken League.
[01:46.98]I'm going to reach out to you guys like a bunch of times during games, and we're gonna get to rank like 21.
[01:54.80]That's all I care about.
[01:55.66]I just want to get to- I want to get to, like, rank, like, 18 or something.
[02:00.71]Rank, like, 22.
[02:02.29]How hard is that?
[02:10.77]That's- How can you- Can I do that in, like, a couple hours?
[02:15.93]And I want- I wanted to- This is a mistake.
[02:19.81]It's alright, though.
[02:22.25]Cooking Simulator was supposed to be today.
[02:25.71]But unfortunately, I got the release date wrong.
[02:29.70]And... It comes out tomorrow.
[02:33.88]So tomorrow, we're gonna play Cooking Simulator.
[02:36.18]I thought it was the 5th.
[02:39.06]It's the 6th.
[02:40.58]I swear to God, the release date changed.
[02:43.38]It was the 5th, I swear.
[02:47.65]But, whatever.
[02:49.31]We're doing it tomorrow, I'm streaming tomorrow too, so... It's releasing tomorrow.
[02:56.58]Cooking Simulator is tomorrow.
[02:58.71]Tonight is going to be... I'm going to just give you a fair warning.
[03:03.79]I'm not going to start until I give you this complete disclaimer.
[03:09.29]You are going to get frustrated on this stream.
[03:13.64]You're going to be mad at me.
[03:15.02]You're going to yell at me.
[03:16.42]You're going to call me names.
[03:19.86]And I'm going to puff my chest out and be like, yeah, right!
[03:33.25]I'm already mad.
[03:34.07]Nah, I'm kidding.
[03:36.19]I'm kidding.
[03:38.21]Here's... I've got smart clicks ready to go.
[03:40.99]I've got... Look at here.
[03:41.69]I'll show you.
[03:42.83]Are you ready?
[03:44.59]Here's Hearthstone.
[03:46.71]I got $45.
[03:48.99]Yes, I did.
[03:49.92]I know.
[03:50.50]Oh, he's gonna open card packs on stream!
[03:55.88]He is... He's a normie!
[03:58.44]I know you're gonna... I know that... I already told you you're gonna be mad.
[04:04.15]I fucking knew it, I told you.
[04:06.27]I saw it, I could smell it.
[04:10.82]I had to do this because if we're gonna make- you guys are gonna make me a deck.
[04:15.64]Look at this, I got arena too.
[04:16.86]You don't think I'm ready to go?
[04:19.62]You guys are gonna pick all this shit.
[04:22.00]And then it's your fault.
[04:23.22]Don't you understand the long game I'm playing here?
[04:27.17]I involve chat.
[04:29.60]Picking all these cards, so then it doesn't matter if I lose?
[04:33.42]Even if I do bad plays, this is your fault, not mine.
[04:39.23]You know, a... You gotta blame the tools sometimes.
[04:45.25]And if you guys are the tools... You know, if you give me a dull hammer, how am I gonna use it?
[04:51.65]I mean, a dull sword.
[04:53.21]How am I gonna cut through steel with it?
[04:54.95]It's not gonna happen.
[05:01.35]Alright, there's also the solo adventure stuff.
[05:03.69]I'm ready just to play.
[05:07.25]But a new expansion came out, I've been playing this in bed.
[05:12.86]Let's open the fucking packs, just because that's what you're here for, and then everyone's gonna leave.
[05:20.16]Enable the clicking?
[05:21.96]Well, not right now.
[05:23.72]What, do you need to enable this for card packs?
[05:31.72]I got the bundle, which you get ten of each.
[05:33.91]I was asking in chat before the stream started how many of these I was gonna need.
[05:41.53]I thought- I was saying three.
[05:44.43]But... I think I need a hundred, but it doesn't matter.
[05:47.12]We're gonna do- we're gonna- I already have a lot of fucking cards.
[05:52.40]Let us click the packs.
[05:53.80]No!
[05:54.60]I'm doing it right now.
[05:55.52]This is like a big deal for me.
[05:56.68]I've never done this before on stream.
[06:02.83]Only 20?
[06:03.93]Which one to open first?
[06:04.73]This one?
[06:06.03]I'm not gonna spend like a fucking hundred dollars on this game.
[06:10.09]I'm gonna get run out of town here.
[06:12.14]I'm gonna get so embarrassed on this stream, I'm not gonna open this again.
[06:15.04]You think I'm gonna buy like $200 worth of card packs?
[06:19.88]Here we go.
[06:21.08]I better get a legendary.
[06:28.15]I just opened up a card pack and got 25 subs!
[06:31.79]Holy shit, that's what was in here?
[06:38.28]KDK945, 20 community subs.
[06:42.18]I should open more of these.
[06:44.18]And C4G, thanks for five community subs.
[06:52.86]No, thank you, that's a lot, thank you.
[06:54.87]Here comes a normie stream.
[06:56.15]I'm gonna put a disclaimer.
[06:59.62]I'm going to put a disclaimer on the screen.
[07:01.76]Like, here comes a normie stream.
[07:03.64]No, this is a fun fucking game.
[07:05.28]I mean, the game... You know, what's happening to me right now?
[07:08.16]I don't know why this is happening.
[07:10.50]But it was.
[07:12.55]Alright, what do we got?
[07:13.71]Seriously, guys, thank you so much for the subs.
[07:15.69]Ooh, look at that.
[07:16.29]We got blue.
[07:20.29]Are these good?
[07:21.99]Oh, I know this is good.
[07:25.43]I've seen this one played before.
[07:27.34]Fight!
[07:28.14]Let me see!
[07:30.61]That's, uh, 20 more community subs.
[07:32.97]This is just trash?
[07:39.39]20 more subs from KDK.
[07:40.55]This is bad?
[07:43.48]He goes, Hey everyone!
[07:46.40]Let me see!
[07:48.40]Oh my fucking god, everyone's giving subs!
[07:50.32]I should pledge my Hearthstone every day!
[07:51.78]That's 50 fucking dollars!
[07:54.48]From Great Canadian.
[07:58.94]Is it this easy?
[08:01.14]It can't be this easy.
[08:06.30]Use it to buy more packs.
[08:11.34]Uh, thank you Great Canadian for the 50 fucking dollars.
[08:19.79]Okay, um, is this turning into a normie stream?
[08:25.33]I'm not supposed to be screaming.
[08:28.23]I'm supposed to shut up today.
[08:29.69]Thanks for five- Oh, I got five subs out of this one!
[08:31.81]Alright, and I have to be really slow at my card pack opening, right?
[08:41.68]Thank you Gnarly for the five subs.
[08:44.02]This is how you do it, right?
[08:44.92]You open up a card pack and you spend like six minutes in here.
[08:48.78]Alright, what's in that one?
[08:53.08]I don't care what this is, I'm using it.
[08:55.99]Do I have to be a shaman?
[08:58.22]Can we make an all frog deck?
[09:01.28]Can we be first to legendary with an all toad deck, all frog deck?
[09:05.65]What class should I be?
[09:08.05]Okay, here we go.

[09:14.47]My heart rate is like fucking 10,000 beats per second.
[09:19.11]Captain Hooktusk.
[09:25.09]Summon three pirates from your deck and give them rush.
[09:27.83]Is that good?
[09:28.45]That's pirates.
[09:31.77]That's not good?
[09:32.32]I mean, six through eight mana.
[09:40.08]This seems not very good.
[09:41.78]That's not gonna be the only legendary.
[09:44.16]I got 18 packs left.
[09:48.20]What's in this one?
[09:50.30]Besides five community sub.
[09:54.09]KDK 5 more subs.
[09:56.47]Oh my god.

[10:10.38]I'm just looking for the good cards.
[10:11.64]Soup?
[10:18.22]Soup?

[10:23.64]Priest?
[10:26.42]Just use a net deck.
[10:27.52]Ah, that's no fun.
[10:32.00]Another 50 fucking dollars came in right now.
[10:36.30]Why is the Hearthstone stream already the most profitable stream I've done in the last, like, six weeks?
[10:45.01]And it's been live for 12 minutes.
[10:48.57]What?
[10:50.18]Ten more community subs.

[22:02.14]That means, so you can cast it twice.
[22:04.78]So Twin Spell is just Echo for spells.
[22:07.68]I need a Reaction Facecam.
[22:09.00]No, I'm not doing that.
[22:11.54]Ray of Frost, this is kind of good.
[22:13.38]Freeze a minion that's already frozen to one mana?
[22:17.40]I... I'm not, no, I'm not, I can't put a webcam on.
[22:23.71]I physically can't turn it on.
[22:24.85]I will get banned from Twitch.
[22:32.37]Three fucking legendaries.
[22:35.75]I haven't... Okay, you know what?
[22:37.03]This is really... It has to be weighted.
[22:39.89]You know what I'm saying?
[22:41.19]There's no way.
[22:42.01]I haven't, like, opened... I haven't bought card packs in probably three to four years.
[22:46.75]Maybe.
[22:48.13]I mean, this has got to be, like, Diablo 3 when you didn't play for long enough.
[22:54.00]They just gave you legendaries, right?
[22:56.91]Here we go.
[22:59.09]Let's play some fucking hype music.
[23:00.68]Like... What's that one that everybody always says to play?
[23:04.40]Fucking who cares.
[23:15.82]Isn't it good?
[23:21.56]Add a copy of each of the Battlecry minions.
[23:25.02]Now he's turning into a YouTuber.
[23:28.80]That's a lot of dust.
[23:34.73]5, 4, 5.
[23:36.23]Add a copy of each other.
[23:38.03]The game's gotten so confusing.
[23:40.21]Battle Cry.
[23:40.85]Add a copy of each of your Battle Cry minions to your head.
[23:44.01]What if I happen to like the 2, 3 alligator?
[23:47.10]And like deal 2 damage.
[23:49.52]This is too much for me.
[23:57.92]That was in 2015.
[23:59.30]Double rare.
[24:07.70]Destroy minions.
[24:08.28]Summon two minions at the same cost to replace it.
[24:10.28]You guys are going to just fucking have to help me here.
[24:11.72]Look at this one.
[24:14.04]Death Destroyer.
[24:14.73]This is really good.
[24:17.73]This is like the best card I think I've ever seen.
[24:20.23]There's a 2-6 taunt that when it's destroyed, it kills a random minion.
[24:25.25]This is like the best card in the whole game.
[24:34.80]Is this correct?
[24:35.78]Is this the best card in the game?
[24:37.06]Because it has to be.
[24:38.38]If there are better cards than this, the power creep has gotten too much.
[24:48.43]Yeah, yeah.
[24:49.05]You're asking chat for... Of course I'm asking chat for advice, because I'm going to be having clickmaps on this whole time.
[24:54.47]And we're going to make our arena deck, too.
[24:56.37]Last pack.
[24:59.09]Come on, give me your energy.
[25:00.79]Give me your energy!
[25:05.43]Legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary.
[25:13.34]Haha.
[25:17.20]Whenever you play a one-cost minion, draw a spell from your deck.
[25:20.70]Cool.
[25:23.43]I don't feel complete, though.
[25:24.49]I, like, feel like... I don't feel... Was it connection interrupted?
[25:31.61]What the hell did that say?
[25:34.61]What was that?
[25:38.39]More packs.
[25:39.19]I'm not buying more packs.
[25:45.48]Should I get another pack?
[25:48.72]How much is one pack?
[25:50.14]No, no, no, no.
[25:51.08]Let me make... Hold on.
[25:52.02]No, I'm not just sitting here and opening fucking cards.
[25:57.16]Can't you... You know, you can get packs.
[26:01.11]By the way, don't look at this.
[26:02.61]Because this is like from 2013.
[26:03.79]And Boo played like 600 of these games.
[26:12.65]Like, Boo like played these games for me.
[26:16.06]I swear to God, that's for real.
[26:19.56]See, look, I can get like money.
[26:20.98]Alright, you guys ready?
[26:24.50]We're not doing this yet.
[26:27.28]I'm not... No, Boo's really good.
[26:28.54]Boo is like legend.
[26:29.88]Boo got to legend like at least twice or something.
[26:31.90]He's really good.
[26:35.75]So, I have this queued up.
[26:38.19]You've been waiting a long time for this.
[26:39.59]I know you desperately want to click on the screen.
[26:41.61]You want to spam the screen.
[26:45.81]It's time for you guys to pick the fucking hero.
[27:00.58]Back.
[27:01.50]Why would I click back?
[27:03.36]Those votes are not being counted.
[27:09.08]Straight from opening decks to building decks.
[27:11.30]I gotta milk it, you know what I mean?
[27:19.41]Garrosh is hot.
[27:21.65]Like, as in he's really good?
[27:24.75]Alright, let's go.
[27:26.81]That's by a pretty overwhelming majority at this point.
[27:31.44]It's gonna be Warrior.
[27:41.17]Now what?
[27:45.35]See, I'm thinking... I'm thinking, um... I'm not gonna tell you what I think.
[27:54.26]This- this- don't cli- why are you clicking down here?
[27:57.24]Stop clicking down here.
[27:58.18]This is not- I'm not gonna click this.
[28:01.33]Archonite Reaper?
[28:01.97]Archonite Reaper sucks.
[28:05.55]This sucked back in 2013.
[28:11.19]You don't want to do this?
[28:12.19]This looks fun.
[28:15.07]I'm wrong.
[28:18.40]Actually wrong, okay?
[28:30.12]I thought it was for me.
[28:32.96]Actually, I don't know what I would do for it with me.
[28:45.60]You guys are too split here.
[28:47.20]Don't click this.
[28:48.12]This is gonna take so long.
[28:58.60]Alright, we're going Divi- No!
[29:00.12]It's gonna happen real quick.
[29:02.14]Divine Shield.
[29:04.43]Let's go.
[29:07.95]By the way, I'm gonna pick the next five cards.
[29:10.15]So, pick right.
[29:14.13]Wow!
[29:14.53]28, 28, 28.
[29:15.84]Holy shit.
[29:25.04]Gain five armor, draw a card.
[29:28.25]Are you guys sure?
[29:29.13]Are you sure?
[29:36.01]Shield block?
[29:42.49]Okay.
[29:47.51]Weapons for each player who equips a tooth-free weapon and six armor.
[29:50.07]If you're holding a spell that costs five more to four damage.
[29:55.14]Some of the seven seven dragon.
[30:00.75]Don't you have to pay to play in this game mode?
[30:03.05]Yes.
[30:03.87]Or you just use coins.
[30:06.93]Alright, we're gonna go Weapons Project.
[30:14.63]This is gonna take like an hour.
[30:17.31]This better be worth it.
[30:24.44]I click on the pretty cards.
[30:30.29]Horse Rider?
[30:32.53]You don't... What about the guy... You guys don't want to collect the guy getting zapped?
[30:36.13]Deal one damage to him and if it survives, add a lackey.
[30:38.21]That's awesome.
[30:42.73]That's so cool.
[30:46.65]This is boring.
[30:47.43]It's just a 2-1 attack.
[30:51.41]Fine.
[30:58.91]Another $50 fucking dollars came in.
[31:04.54]$50 from some guy.
[31:06.76]Some guy 9.
[31:07.86]More packs plus Doom OST or fucking Riot.
[31:13.98]Golden Force Tank.
[31:16.15]Oh, nice.
[31:17.89]I agree.
[31:18.43]I would have picked that one too.
[31:27.51]It's Riot time.
[31:28.59]I'm not doing $50 in card packs.
[31:32.90]Gain 4- yep.
[31:34.44]Definitely.
[31:34.90]You guys are smart.
[31:40.80]I'm not gonna do $50 in card packs!
[31:43.18]That's gonna take like 40 minutes!
[31:51.65]Ooh, kinda juries out on this one.
[31:58.40]Has plus one attack while damaged, and then... I mean, always Knife Juggler, right?
[32:07.58]Alright, we're almost a third of the way there.
[32:09.03]Okay, I'm gonna pick... After this, I'm gonna pick the next five cards.
[32:15.23]And you guys are gonna have to work with what I pick, because I'm not... This is taking like... No?
[32:20.83]What do you mean, no?
[32:22.88]Just open packs until people stop donating.
[32:31.43]Mechanical Yeti is really good.
[32:34.23]I remember.
[32:34.73]Boo told me that.
[32:38.92]This one.
[32:39.52]I don't even need your guys' opinion on this.
[32:41.22]It's always this one.
[32:42.18]Right?
[32:42.60]Always.
[32:43.60]Every single time.
[32:44.32]Right?
[32:46.60]This is the one that goes... And then has like 40 damage.
[32:53.16]Right?
[32:54.02]Yeah.
[32:59.57]I like this one because it's just going like...
[33:10.76]Hmm.
[33:12.38]See, I just said that.
[33:13.26]Now everyone's clicking on it.
[33:17.65]Armorsmith.
[33:22.53]Two more seconds.
[33:24.39]Two.
[33:25.79]One.
[33:30.91]Okay, come on.
[33:32.05]Come on.
[33:32.37]Give me a good one.
[33:33.41]Make me a good deck, guys.
[33:38.02]This deck looks...
[33:39.38]Awful, by the way.
[33:41.12]Terrible.
[33:43.90]You failed.
[33:50.83]Oh, look at this one.
[33:53.45]I had to click that one.
[33:54.31]Look at it.
[34:01.54]Zoo.
[34:03.96]Okay.
[34:05.42]Your turn.
[34:15.40]Wow, so cool.
[34:16.38]Hearthstone's so cool.
[34:17.25]Open more packs, dumbass.
[34:19.85]What the fuck?
[34:25.35]Alright.
[34:25.71]Shuffle a bomb into your opponent's deck.
[34:27.17]Yeah, this one's cool.
[34:30.87]You guys are dealing with a toddler right now.
[34:32.37]You understand?
[34:32.83]Like, if I see something that I think is cool... I mean, I'm about to click it.
[34:36.17]I'm close to clicking this just because of this.
[34:42.45]Each player gets a tooth-free weapon and six armor.
[34:44.49]Each player?
[34:47.56]Why would I want to give somebody six armor and a tooth-free weapon to the other player?
[34:51.74]I don't want to give that person anything.
[35:03.10]So I can destroy them.
[35:10.12]I'm not clicking back!
[35:11.70]We have to make, we have to complete this.
[35:13.34]I'm not gonna get halfway through and then not do this.
[35:20.12]I mean, I'm pretty biased on this one.
[35:22.05]This is an original card.
[35:24.17]Yeah, I agree.
[35:24.75]Some of you guys are really smart.
[35:29.05]No epics or legendaries or anything?
[35:31.17]How many rares have we even seen?
[35:32.73]One?
[35:36.18]These, these votes are not counted.
[35:40.95]Five more community subs from Austin Atlantis.
[35:45.80]Thank you so much for the five community subs.
[35:48.56]Steal?
[35:48.98]I thought this was the worst card in the game.
[35:52.52]Play single player?
[35:53.38]I am, don't worry.
[35:54.04]This ain't gonna be like a two hour long stream.
[35:56.98]This is gonna be a long one.
[35:57.78]This is gonna be at least three hours.
[36:00.14]I'm kidding, it's gonna be like eight.
[36:04.46]Okay.
[36:06.28]Guys, you gotta make me the deck first before we do anything.
[36:09.90]Hopefully these cards are good.
[36:16.44]Don't- we have too many two and three drops.
[36:21.26]I'm gonna- my whole deck is gonna be two drops.
[36:24.74]Give your weapon plus one attack?
[36:34.10]Am I gonna even beat one person with this?
[36:39.20]Two-drop OP in Arena, is it?
[36:43.58]More shield block.
[36:49.20]Not the Ninja Turtle enemy?
[36:50.84]Alright.
[36:57.73]You have bad two-drops.
[37:03.69]Do I even have any taunts?
[37:07.65]No, I don't.
[37:08.09]I think this is the only taunt card that's showed up.
[37:13.03]I have a really bad mana curve.
[37:14.47]Alright, we're getting close.
[37:20.03]Final 10 here.
[37:30.11]Mad Bomber.
[37:31.37]Ooh!
[37:33.75]Big clicks coming in on Giggling Inventor.
[37:42.32]Mm-hmm.
[37:43.18]This is gonna be... I gotta wait this one out.
[37:48.24]Inventor sucks?
[37:50.97]That's a... Okay, I didn't even look at the mana.
[37:54.31]I thought this was like a two or three drop card.
[37:56.69]It's seven fucking mana?
[38:00.47]That's two... That's kind of not good.
[38:02.49]It used to be five.
[38:08.85]It got nerfed.
[38:10.07]Well, here we go.
[38:15.36]Alright.
[38:19.50]That's how good it is.
[38:20.78]Oh, I see.
[38:22.28]Three mana, four, five.
[38:23.68]Okay, Jerma.
[38:26.49]Someone has seven, seven mechanical dragon.
[38:30.81]Okay.
[38:33.77]Okay.
[38:40.43]Annoyatron is like, is the best, right?
[38:44.28]I'm about to click it.
[38:45.73]Just so I can hear him do his voice line.
[38:53.87]Snake Jupiter?
[38:54.67]Alright, here we go.
[39:04.48]Oh yeah, this is the best card in Oringa.
[39:08.33]Behold the might of Storm!
[39:11.41]STORM!
[39:12.89]STORMWIND!
[39:14.63]I got it, here we go.
[39:19.11]You must have to sing when you do these cards.
[39:22.92]Ah!
[39:31.65]Ah!
[39:33.91]Another zoo!
[39:34.55]I would- I could run off two zoos.
[39:37.93]Fine.
[39:45.72]What?
[39:50.44]Who clicked that?
[39:52.40]Gained four armor, so I'm gonna random four cost minion.
[39:54.06]That's pretty good.
[39:57.40]I don't have any zero or one drops, and I have no late game.
[40:04.55]Can I get any cards?
[40:05.87]I need some, like, epics and some legendaries.
[40:07.55]Two ironforged portals.
[40:09.91]Can we make it three ironforged portals?
[40:18.19]Armor smith.
[40:22.38]Alright.
[40:22.98]Crowd favorite.
[40:23.60]Whenever you play a card with Battlecry, gain plus one, one.
[40:30.38]Oh, look.
[40:31.14]A one drop.
[40:35.89]At least I'll have something to play.
[40:42.21]Alright.
[40:42.59]Only two more.
[40:45.27]We're almost done.
[40:51.26]Rarity does not mean good.
[40:52.48]Yeah, that's true.
[40:53.40]Another one drop.
[40:54.24]They hurt us.
[41:00.50]Alright.
[41:01.44]What do we got?
[41:04.76]Omega Devastator.
[41:07.08]If you have 10 mana crystals, deal 10 damage to a minion.
[41:10.94]Super Collider.
[41:11.90]After you attack a minion, force it to attack one of its neighbors.
[41:17.72]What?
[41:17.94]What?
[41:26.38]That's, like, unfair.
[41:32.08]Alright.
[41:35.22]Alright.
[41:36.84]I'm ready.
[41:40.05]Let's try one.
[41:40.89]Let's try two.
[41:41.57]Let's go.

[41:51.23]Hold on, let me just make sure this is... Is this working?
[41:54.89]Alright, there we go.
[41:55.71]Okay.
[41:57.86]Alright, let's go!
[42:01.86]Oh, wait, it's not on.
[42:02.66]Is it on screen?
[42:04.69]Oh, by the way, for all the stream snipers, uh, get fucked.
[42:27.80]Oh shit, what?
[42:28.26]That's my name!
[42:28.74]I don't want anyone to see that!
[42:34.46]Alright, here we go.
[42:35.16]I don't need any help this game.
[42:36.26]Ready?
[42:37.31]Bang.
[42:38.11]Hold this.
[42:43.23]Ooh, I got a one-drop right off the bat!
[42:53.99]Cover up your name.
[42:55.18]Why?
[43:02.35]Come on, come on!
[43:03.33]Let's go!
[43:09.11]Cover your name.
[43:10.66]Why?
[43:11.08]What's wrong?
[43:15.26]People know that's my name?
[43:18.52]Oh, he got a legendary.
[43:19.34]He automatically wins.
[43:23.61]Alright, so he's got a golden portrait, too.
[43:26.17]This means that he plays.
[43:30.97]When does this minion take damage?
[43:32.51]He's... Okay, here we go.
[43:33.37]Ready?
[43:39.63]What?
[43:39.79]I got roped off?
[43:41.25]What?
[43:42.12]Hold on.
[43:42.68]Why did I get roped?
[43:44.40]I was like five seconds.
[43:53.12]That just like hurt me.
[43:55.20]It's time for a little blood.
[44:00.08]Oh, what the fuck do I do?
[44:05.55]The rope is early.
[44:06.31]Each player equips 2-3 weapon and gains 6 armor.
[44:08.65]And then I'm going to hit him.
[44:31.14]What do you mean order?
[44:31.77]What?
[44:33.89]What is this one?
[44:34.49]That's not bad.
[44:59.61]You're BMing this person.
[45:00.89]No, I'm not.
[45:01.31]What are you talking about?
[45:06.71]Add two 4-4 dragons to your hand.
[45:14.12]Okay, well you can... Alright, help me!
[45:16.74]What do you want me to do?
[45:20.95]Quick, quick!
[45:21.45]I don't have much time!
[45:24.39]What are you clicking on?
[45:25.33]I don't have much time!
[45:39.94]This is not gonna work.
[45:45.66]Are you serious?
[45:56.19]There's no way you played the game.
[45:57.39]I told you that I was not gonna... I should just go back to this single player.
[46:00.29]Okay, actually, I don't...
[46:08.35]Just do this.
[46:10.87]Just going to portal up.
[46:14.65]Come on, that sucks.
[46:16.39]That sucks!
[46:28.00]He's just going to kill that right now.
[46:31.44]People are coming and expecting good Hearthstone Gateflow.
[46:33.58]I'm going to have to make a disclaimer.
[46:37.95]He's got good cards.
[46:38.67]Alright, well I'm going to kill that, and then I'm going to... I'm going to Mad Bomber first.
[46:45.10]Wait a minute, hold on here.
[46:46.98]Wait a minute, hold on here.
[46:53.36]Super Collider.
[46:55.67]Kill the dragon.
[47:00.83]Oh, check this shit out.
[47:09.52]Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy.
[47:11.24]I'm gonna hit this guy.
[47:11.78]He's gonna kill the dragon.
[47:15.38]Bingo.
[47:17.62]Oh, fuck!
[47:18.05]I forgot!
[47:18.63]Okay, I forgot.
[47:19.39]I thought I just did the damage that he... I got it.
[47:30.53]What?
[47:31.33]Why?
[47:31.81]I don't have one of those.
[47:39.97]Alright, I'm going to Mad Bomber and Anoatron.
[47:45.39]Or I could... Mechanical Whelp and Anoatron.
[47:48.95]No, Mad Bomber and Anoatron.
[47:57.83]Come on.
[48:02.46]I mean, I just have to last.
[48:03.90]I have no draw either.
[48:08.51]Am I serious?
[48:09.61]Boomer tactics.
[48:10.91]Guys, I'm not even going to look at the chat anymore.
[48:19.62]What do I mean, attack him?
[48:25.76]No, what?
[48:26.36]I can... Now I'm going to attack Illidan because he's going to kill two people.
[48:36.02]Okay, watch this shit.
[48:37.68]He's gonna kill both these people!
[48:39.10]Let me see, divine charge, hold on, I could do... Wait, it doesn't hit both people?
[48:55.65]Force attack one of its neighbors.
[48:57.17]Oh, fuck.
[48:57.81]Well, here comes the RNG.
[48:58.97]Ready?
[49:01.07]Check this out.
[49:05.94]Left!
[49:06.64]LEFT!
[49:07.76]YES!
[49:10.96]Oh, what was that?
[49:16.20]Secret?
[49:17.24]Doesn't matter.
[49:29.59]Okay, I gotta settle down.
[49:41.31]Guaranteed victory.
[49:42.39]Guaranteed.
[49:43.31]Oh, that's not good.
[49:53.91]Your deck sucks and you're bald.
[49:56.41]Alright.
[49:58.37]Here we go, ready?
[49:59.69]Whack into this guy.
[50:02.68]They've been kind to me before.
[50:06.86]They've been kind to me before!
[50:08.38]They'll be kind to me again.
[50:17.24]Let me see, I could go right in the middle here.
[50:26.28]Don't worry Lux, the cavalry's here!
[50:45.62]I'm not gonna rope him, I'm just trying to... I'm trying.
[50:49.38]It's like... Holy shit!
[51:09.29]I forgot that comes out.
[51:10.29]I'm in a good position.
[51:16.16]This guy has TWO LEGENDARIES in his fucking deck?!
[51:20.68]Whaaaat?!
[51:23.54]Is that even possible?!
[51:24.54]Oh, get out of here!
[51:32.13]I can't... Do I just get rid of these?
[51:55.87]I'm still alright.
[51:56.66]I mean, he has more cards, but... Is he going to melt down?
[52:02.34]No, I'm about to freeze up.
[52:05.56]Alright, what are you going to do?
[52:13.43]What are you going to do?
[52:15.31]I'm going right... Don't matter.
[52:16.09]He's on the ropes now.
[52:16.63]I'm going right at the face.
[52:19.75]Oh, yeah.
[52:20.41]Excuse me.
[52:28.04]You gotta rush me down here.
[52:40.96]Hammer the face with one damage?
[52:42.86]Why would I do that?
[53:01.13]Ah, so many viewers.
[53:05.45]That guy's got amazing cards!
[53:15.68]I'm gonna have to hit this.
[53:18.80]So, I mean... RNG, here we go.
[53:23.29]It's gonna hit him.
[53:24.67]It's gonna do it.
[53:32.21]I almost busted that up.
[53:34.33]Alright, here we go.
[53:34.97]I need to get people out here.
[53:39.83]It's not over.
[53:43.36]I'm going to topdeck something.
[53:49.46]He had two legendaries.
[53:50.50]Remember that.
[53:57.66]Three Legendaries.
[53:58.22]Yeah, three Legendaries.
[53:59.70]How do you even get three Legendaries in Arena?
[54:05.18]My whole deck is two drops.
[54:09.37]It's alright.
[54:09.91]Here we go.
[54:10.33]Top deck.
[54:10.79]That's the best one.
[54:12.23]You guys got mad at me for picking this.
[54:13.63]Give a friendly demon one... It's over.
[54:29.58]Concede?
[54:30.14]I don't concede.
[54:32.76]They have to earn it.
[54:33.36]No, I went well played.
[54:39.89]Not thanks.
[54:41.65]It's alright.
[54:42.09]That was unfair.
[54:45.41]Unfair.
[54:47.50]Here we go.
[55:24.59]Your deck sucks.
[55:27.53]What am I doing?
[55:28.23]I'm pretending to click the button so I can avoid stream snuffers.
[55:35.23]Alright, this is a better start.
[55:40.45]Dump it all.
[55:44.68]Does it matter?
[55:45.22]No, not really.
[55:46.14]Who cares?
[55:47.44]Told you to dump it all.
[55:48.16]Look at that.
[55:48.48]Get a good start here.
[55:51.16]And I get the coin.
[55:52.12]Coin Annoyatron.
[55:53.84]First thing.
[55:56.93]Coin, Annoyatron.
[56:02.70]Oh, I got a Rager too.
[56:03.52]I need to delete that from the game, it's like too easy to hurt people.
[56:17.89]Alright, now, look, we got options here.
[56:19.37]Alright, so, uh... Annoyatron.
[56:22.33]Or, Armor Up.
[56:23.82]I'm gonna say...
[56:37.67]On the ropes here.
[56:38.51]What do you got?
[56:39.79]Draw a mech from your deck.
[56:42.95]I think this is a Coin Rager opportunity here.
[56:45.11]Oh, no, this is not a Coin Rager.
[56:46.53]This is a Divine Shield Charge Horse Rider.
[56:51.33]Or it's a Rager and just get rid of it.
[56:58.56]Coin Rager.
[57:13.83]Did I do that wrong?
[57:15.93]That was that wrong?
[57:17.51]That wasn't wrong, right?
[57:24.97]Well, what would you do in this scenario?
[57:30.17]Quick, quickly!
[57:30.85]I don't have much time.
[57:32.45]I'm not going to, like, end turn.
[57:34.61]All right.
[57:35.47]Okay, I see what you guys want me to do.
[57:36.79]I see it.
[57:37.07]14%.
[57:37.09]18% want me to do.
[57:38.15]Okay, I got it.
[57:39.25]What?
[57:39.71]What?
[58:01.33]I had to get... I don't want... It's a... It's a hunter!
[58:03.86]Hunters have tons of minions.
[58:05.20]You missed the lethal.
[58:10.54]These are... Let's go get those card packs!
[58:15.01]I'm good at the... I'm good at doing that!
[58:23.69]Well, here's a mech, right?
[58:25.59]It's... There's no... Give a random friendly beast, dragon, and murloc.
[58:28.60]Plus, I don't... I only have... I have a beast.
[58:32.84]Do the weapon here.
[58:41.35]That's not bad.
[58:51.58]Yeah, pretty good.
[58:58.69]You're delaying the stream.
[58:59.65]What if you're getting stream sniped?
[59:00.99]I mean, everybody... Okay.
[59:03.05]If you were stream sniping, you watched me build the deck, so you already know all my cards anyway.
[59:07.75]It don't matter.
[59:17.53]Alright, let's see.
[59:18.07]What do I got here?
[59:19.05]That's not a bad idea.
[59:23.02]Just go for it.
[59:23.86]Four cost minion.
[59:24.64]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[59:30.80]Come on, something big.
[59:32.12]That's... Alright.
[59:33.30]I'm okay with that.
[59:34.04]That's pretty good.
[59:45.31]God damn it.
[59:58.98]There's the reaper.
[60:03.21]Reaper, I'm just gonna Reaper.
[60:15.53]Time to reap.
[60:20.47]Oh, come on.
[60:23.41]3-6?
[60:24.87]What is that thing?
[60:25.75]Your Deathrattle's triggered twice!
[60:33.99]I think I gotta get out the force tank.
[60:38.51]No.
[60:39.27]Taunt and... Kill the dark iron dwarf.
[60:47.03]Taunt and kill the dwarf.
[60:49.01]And then get some armor.
[61:14.91]Hey, it's alright.
[61:15.61]When you get to 0 and 2, you play all the other, like, chumps that are 0 and 2, right?
[61:20.83]And then they, like, go face with their spells.
[61:35.66]You are the chump.
[61:36.36]I'm not saying I'm not the chump.
[61:37.62]I'm just saying I'll go up against... If you're 0 and 2, we're in like the 0-2 chump class.
[61:45.14]I don't really have any options.
[61:46.28]I don't have any options.
[62:08.53]bottom right is best option.
[62:13.53]He's thinking.
[62:14.91]He's thinking right now.
[62:15.69]He's not sure what to do.
[62:24.06]This thing has been here the whole game.
[62:26.18]Well, I can't get rid of it.
[62:27.52]I don't have any way to get rid of it.
[62:34.17]Smart click doesn't work because people just click everywhere and it confuses me.
[62:38.44]I'm still in this.
[62:49.15]Oh, what a godsend.
[62:52.69]Mad bomber weapons project.
[63:06.56]Oh fuck, I can do this!
[63:08.14]Whatever, don't matter.
[63:13.39]God damn it.
[63:16.51]I'm gonna go 0 and fucking 3 and then uninstall the game.
[63:34.33]This is not a meltdown, this is not, what the fuck?
[63:47.91]It's not a meltdown, unless I say it is.
[63:53.16]You know what, let's just... He's probably like, holy fuck, I didn't know he had that many!
[64:24.98]This deck is not very good.
[64:26.60]Look at this deck.
[64:27.36]What is this deck?
[64:29.88]I got three legendaried in the first game.
[64:32.21]I haven't played this game in like four years.
[64:34.13]Got three legendaried in the first game.
[64:36.51]Second game, I made a little bit of an oops.
[64:38.75]You know, I accidentally did a little oops and then it cost me the game.
[64:42.23]That's what happens.
[65:08.87]Alright, it's your guys' turn.
[65:10.38]You gotta pull me out of 0 and 3 here.
[65:22.62]What happened to Cooking Simulator?
[65:23.86]It's not out.
[65:25.00]It releases tomorrow.
[65:27.61]I got the date wrong.
[65:30.81]So... I was supposed to do that today.
[65:38.60]Does this dump everything here?
[65:46.70]Add another oopsie to the pile.
[65:48.93]Alright, it's your turn.
[65:50.41]Whatever the highest percentage is, is what I'm doing.
[65:52.01]And you gotta be quick.
[65:52.85]And we have one turn for you to figure it out.
[66:02.15]Okay, go.
[66:16.35]Nice job.
[66:17.51]Nice thinking.
[66:21.01]Okay, go.
[66:34.45]Why would you end turn again?
[66:44.23]No, I'm not gonna fucking end turn again.
[66:46.57]Is that what you were clicking on?
[66:52.07]I think that's what you were clicking on.
[66:53.62]And then you want me to hit, right?
[66:54.52]Yes, you do.
[67:10.40]Funny man bad at card games.
[67:14.66]It's just too much for me to have to do.
[67:18.88]I can't do this on stream.
[67:20.44]I just can't.
[67:23.37]When I sit there with my fucking mouth open in my bed, it doesn't matter.
[67:27.07]I just play whatever I'm gonna play.
[67:29.39]I can't.
[67:29.97]I'm gonna.
[67:30.67]The stream's not over.
[67:34.09]You know what?
[67:34.72]I'm doing this.
[67:36.20]I'm doing this on my own.
[67:37.04]I'm gonna win.
[67:38.52]I'm not gonna even look at the chat.
[67:39.94]You ready for this?
[67:49.51]I'm not going to look.
[67:50.55]I know there's going to be people that have dissenting opinions.
[67:53.37]I'm going to beat this.
[67:54.95]Check this out.
[67:55.31]I already know Flynn.
[68:17.73]This is a fun game.
[68:40.42]It is.
[68:40.90]I'm just...
[68:48.50]This is just a warm-up game.
[68:49.60]Alright.
[68:55.36]Mm-hmm.
[69:34.67]I'm gonna be quiet.
[69:38.92]See, that's why I did that.
[69:40.26]That's the reason why I did that.
[69:41.34]Because now he had to kill that minion on this character.
[69:44.34]That's why I did that.
[69:45.86]I need to explain myself.
[69:46.86]You guys know the fucking strategies.
[70:09.81]No, I can't.
[70:21.16]I hate doing this.
[70:24.82]I fucking hate attacking and then dying into nothing.
[70:31.81]It's fine.
[70:37.83]And then I can do... Alright, I can take care of this.
[70:40.57]See, make him do it.
[70:44.95]Fuck.
[70:45.19]This is bad.
[70:47.69]This is not good.
[70:59.82]Gain 5 armor, draw.
[71:01.16]I can draw, but...
[71:07.36]This is not gonna do anything.
[71:10.39]Just drop every card.
[71:14.85]Worst deck ever!
[71:22.81]Oh, damn it!
[71:23.42]I don't have a coin!
[71:24.20]I don't want to put this down.
[71:45.83]Just buy more packs!
[71:55.99]Is this arena?
[71:56.56]This is arena.
[71:58.32]This is the first thing I'm playing.
[72:00.68]After four years of not playing against another human being in this game, I decided that I was gonna play Arena, and have Twitch pick the cards, and they gave me fucking shitty cards.
[72:10.77]On purpose, for like a joke.
[72:21.98]I'm gonna go 0-3.
[72:28.10]Fucking on stream.
[72:29.14]I'm gonna go 0-3.
[72:35.57]I can't go 0-3.
[72:36.09]I'm gonna go 0-3.
[72:37.05]No, I'm not.
[72:48.80]It's not bad.
[72:50.41]And then Berserker.
[73:08.47]Damn it!
[73:10.42]Right when I have an opportunity to like pull this back.
[73:12.92]Does this deck just suck or am I like the stupidest Hearthstone player on Twitch?
[73:41.61]I can't go 0 and 3.
[73:43.45]No.
[73:44.84]It can't start like this.
[73:46.12]I'm just gonna go play with the funny cards in single player mode.
[73:49.98]I don't even... Nothing even matters.
[74:10.71]Whatever.
[74:11.15]Thanks for the extra damage.
[74:13.31]It's not gonna do anything for me.
[74:14.41]I don't even need to do that.
[74:21.00]I'm just gonna go to the funny cards after this.
[74:33.97]I got like the extension for this.
[74:37.57]Let's go.
[74:39.49]No, it's because we got bad calls.
[74:44.23]We got bad draw from the arena choice.
[74:55.82]We went to arena first.
[74:57.16]Don't let this sour your opinion of me.
[75:18.74]Nice!
[75:46.97]Do you even get a key?
[75:48.23]Or do they send you like home?
[75:53.98]Do they send you home with like a needs improvement, have your parents sign the report card?
[76:00.00]Piece of paper.
[76:15.79]I got a card pack out of that.
[76:19.14]Nice.
[76:19.50]Come on, give me something like pity legendaries.
[76:30.22]Two rares.
[76:38.00]Well, let's start with Arena.
[76:39.94]I shouldn't have started with Arena.
[76:41.86]Arena is like, people are very good at it.
[76:44.30]They play it and they... One of those guys had the gold characters, which means he has like 5,000 wins.
[76:49.01]I didn't even look at the cards that I opened.
[77:02.37]I play... These are fun.
[77:03.93]I've done these already.
[77:08.45]I'm going to do the solo thing.
[77:13.33]See, I've been doing this.
[77:14.61]It's fun.
[77:17.35]Because this, you don't have to pay cards.
[77:19.39]They just do it for you.
[77:21.44]It's great.
[77:23.64]Heroic or... I can't do heroic.
[77:32.62]Heroic.
[77:33.42]I can't do that.
[77:43.40]Baby mode.
[77:44.78]Let me just see if I have the confidence to be able to play this game.
[77:48.46]I've already done it a bunch.
[77:51.18]I'll let you pick this.
[77:52.82]If you don't know what this is, it's a lot of fun.
[77:54.70]Okay?
[77:55.12]I started with Arena and what a mistake that was.
[77:58.61]Who should I play with?
[78:03.23]I gotta build my confidence back up.
[78:10.99]I hate fun.
[78:16.85]Oh, also, another funny little tidbit here of information.
[78:20.85]You know how I said that Cooking Simulator launches tomorrow?
[78:27.39]I thought it launched today.
[78:29.57]Well, I was under the assumption that the new week was today, but that's also apparently tomorrow, too.
[78:42.36]I thought this was going to be open today.
[78:47.88]It's tomorrow.
[78:53.22]Week four is tomorrow.
[78:56.86]Yeah, fourth week of the new part of the adventure.
[78:59.54]Looks like we're gonna do Rogue.
[79:08.54]Tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[79:09.26]you're gonna do an early stream?
[79:12.90]No, I'm doing Cooking Simulator tomorrow.
[79:17.85]I've fucking beaten 19 people.
[79:21.92]See?
[79:22.68]I've done this.
[79:23.70]This is my number.
[79:24.50]Alright, which one?
[79:28.82]The dagger, the random card from another class, or two damage to an undamaged minion.
[79:36.91]You've only done 19.
[79:38.95]Don't be mean to me.
[79:39.71]I just play this in bed.
[79:40.99]Okay, we'll do that one.
[79:48.49]And?
[79:53.20]Which deck would you like to do?
[79:54.12]We don't have to pick on this one.
[79:56.80]Random.
[80:03.82]A random deck.
[80:06.76]Alright.
[80:12.19]That's the way it's gonna be.
[80:15.53]Let's go.
[80:19.90]So it's kind of like a roguelike.
[80:21.56]You start at the beginning and you fight bosses.
[80:23.56]It's eight bosses.
[80:25.02]If they go down, you complete the run.
[80:26.50]If you don't, if you lose, you have to go back to the very beginning.
[80:30.62]You get upgrades along the... Okay.
[80:36.56]Fine.
[80:37.14]We'll just go.
[80:45.49]For a second, I was about to play this, but nobody can stream snipe me.
[80:51.61]You know, okay, I'll give you... If I was in bed right now, this would be... I wouldn't even mind.
[81:05.90]It doesn't matter.
[81:06.83]I would just be like, oh, I want to shoot this thing.
[81:08.37]I want to play with this one.
[81:10.67]There are 3,600 people in my bed, and I don't like it.
[81:18.31]You know, I feel like this is my, like, bedtime thing.
[81:26.51]All right, so every single, every single turn, we're going to do a, you know, equivalent exchange.
[81:36.72]Swap a random card in each player's hand.
[81:38.26]This is just clown shit.
[81:39.72]It doesn't matter.
[81:40.40]So who cares?
[81:41.10]Job's done.
[81:48.33]See, like, this is just clown shit.
[81:50.29]It doesn't matter.
[81:51.17]Nobody can, like, say it was a bad move because, like, that was... What am I supposed to do about that?
[81:56.26]I can't stop that.
[82:00.24]Draw a card.
[82:00.72]Does Deathrattle cast this again?
[82:02.58]I don't think I even have any Deathrattle cards.
[82:04.70]Let's just steal something.
[82:07.79]See, look, it's a total just dog shit mode.
[82:11.73]I'm not supposed to have this.
[82:20.16]Click the funny sound buttons?
[82:21.36]Okay.
[82:32.17]I don't have any death barrel cards.
[82:33.33]Okay, we need to pick death barrel cards.
[82:35.53]This thing can't even attack.
[82:38.53]I'm just gonna steal another card.
[82:39.45]What does this do?
[82:41.03]Four health to each hero.
[82:44.10]I don't have any silences either.
[82:48.77]Give me another one.
[82:51.59]Give all dragons into our hand, 3-3.
[82:58.19]Ooh.
[83:06.04]If I had a dragon, that'd be fucking incredible.
[83:07.84]Alright, let's get some board here.
[83:14.78]Just to get it out there.
[83:15.94]I mean, it can't attack, but the computer's stupid, so the computer will probably attack it.
[83:20.56]And there's the shark.
[83:22.50]Eat a minion in your deck and it gains its stats.
[83:24.51]Add it to your hand if it dies.
[83:30.03]Look, the computer is as dumb as me.
[83:35.80]That won't do.
[83:36.86]On second thought, let's swap back.
[83:43.01]Alright, we got something cool here.
[83:53.64]This deck is so bad.
[83:55.94]Deal two damage, give you a C'Thun.
[83:58.07]I don't even fucking have a C'Thun.
[84:06.55]I think I should add a random potion to your hand.
[84:11.80]Lethal?
[84:12.28]I can't attack with this.
[84:20.04]Deal 5 damage to all characters.
[84:21.86]Well... What does this do?
[84:24.46]Minus 3 attack this turn.
[84:25.58]I just did that.
[84:40.51]Now we're gonna do shark Five damage to all characters.
[84:46.65]No, I don't wanna do that.
[84:48.57]Deal one damage to all other minions.
[84:51.67]I mean, I think I'm gonna do shark No, let's do shark I don't have any more minions?
[85:06.20]I only have one card!
[85:15.18]Fucking god.
[85:19.14]Alright, it's time to win.
[85:27.59]So that's five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[85:33.47]I win!
[85:33.99]I beat level one on normal!
[85:48.23]Okay.
[85:49.98]What treasure do you want me to pick?
[85:51.10]Should I pick, like, give me, like, advice?
[85:55.80]Don't click that one.
[85:58.08]That one is so stupid.
[85:59.50]Don't do that.
[86:04.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[86:05.89]I'm gonna lose in the last, if I get far enough.
[86:14.20]Look at how good these other ones are!
[86:15.62]Alright, I need to... What box?
[86:21.64]What creature box am I gonna do?
[86:31.28]I don't even... What the hell?
[86:32.22]What did we... There's such a random amount of cards.
[86:36.96]It actually just truly is random nonsense.
[86:40.20]Cold Blood three times.
[86:50.63]These guys are just trying to get me to lose.
[86:56.57]Four, I guess, like, four or eight.
[87:04.09]Do you have a weapon?
[87:04.89]I don't even think I have a weapon.
[87:08.05]Alright, coming up next is... What?
[87:20.82]What do we have to do to fight Wendy again?
[87:22.64]This is the same thing?
[87:34.93]It's the same... Oh, no.
[87:35.91]Uh, yeah, game 1-1 for each other.
[87:36.95]Pirate, yeah, but I don't have any other pirates.
[87:51.51]Oh, Wendy stream sniped me.
[87:55.56]Alright, give helpful advice.
[87:56.66]What?
[87:56.80]Wait, why did I just get these?
[87:57.98]That's not advice, that's cheating.
[88:18.55]Cheating is advice.
[88:19.73]No, it's not.
[88:20.55]How many of these do I... I can't even play these!
[88:23.08]I have to, like, get a fucking minion out here.
[88:38.03]Well, I'll be able to do all kinds of fun stuff.
[88:41.87]Divine Shield, draw a card.
[88:47.10]I mean, should I just give him a fucking shitload?
[88:51.57]I think I'm gonna do Divine Shield.
[88:54.51]Or, should I do... Prep, and then... Prep, Double Cold Blood.
[89:20.44]See, this is why, this is why I like this.
[89:24.64]No pressure.
[89:27.06]NO STREAM SHNIVERAGE!
[89:31.10]Um, I don't fucking have Deathrattle.
[89:33.47]Yes I do, I guess.
[89:35.85]Just store 12 health to a friendly character.
[89:49.90]This is our town, Scruff.
[89:52.06]Yeah, right.
[89:55.06]Okay, if you could friendly fire, I would have just killed myself.
[90:00.43]Deal one damage.
[90:01.25]Let me look at these.
[90:03.45]Divine shield.
[90:05.43]Magnetic rush.
[90:06.31]Let me see.
[90:06.97]What have we got here?
[90:19.99]Didn't even need anybody's help!
[90:28.38]Yes, I'm a Nuki, I know that, I'm aware of that.
[90:32.82]I'm so fucking good.
[90:33.98]Alright, pick a box.
[90:41.36]You're doing really good.
[90:42.82]Carried by Khadgar, that's fine.
[90:46.25]More combo.
[90:56.06]Deal 2 damage.
[90:56.80]Summon a Jade Golem.
[90:57.96]An evil Miscreant.
[90:59.08]Add 2 random lackeys.
[91:01.18]Alright.
[91:02.54]Who's next?
[91:05.06]Shhh!
[91:07.89]Soothe Sayer's Zoe.
[91:09.11]At the start of your turn, restore 2 health to all friendly minions.
[91:13.45]That's fucking insane.
[91:16.37]How are we ever going to be able to beat this?
[91:26.87]Did you just mute Dr. Boom?
[91:28.35]That's not Dr. Boom.
[91:38.24]Alright, I want... I mean, that's... Two damage is two damage.
[91:45.30]By the way, if you're curious, everybody's attack and health have swapped.
[91:49.92]You probably already knew that.
[91:54.02]Let me keep this.
[92:01.56]Alright, Khadgar, give me some more free shit.
[92:08.22]Is there any circumstance where you would ever play this card?
[92:16.34]Yes, there is.
[92:17.12]What the fuck is the scenario?
[92:20.90]Draw the rest of your deck.
[92:23.39]I mean, that didn't really help, but thanks.
[92:36.64]Silver hand recruit you control.
[92:42.42]If you have an empty hand and ten cards left.
[92:44.32]Yeah, I guess.
[92:45.82]I guess it is just a huge draw, but... So many crazy things that they've added.
[92:54.15]Well, here's the two damage.
[92:55.69]Cthulhu!
[92:56.91]Cthulhu!
[92:58.05]Cthulhu!
[93:05.29]Cause zero.
[93:06.21]Okay, what do we got?
[93:07.21]I got some damage here.
[93:09.67]Deal two damage!
[93:12.11]Ooh!
[93:12.81]No, I can't do that.
[93:14.79]I could do... I could do this.
[93:18.47]I could do... What's more important?
[93:24.18]Oh, I don't know what's more important.
[93:25.86]This is all combos!
[93:30.12]Two damage into bandit into hit?
[93:34.69]Or two damage into... That works.
[93:54.13]One into two into three into one into two?
[93:55.59]Uh-oh.
[94:03.47]I hate combo cards.
[94:07.35]It's too many problems to deal with.
[94:09.35]It's too many chains.
[94:11.97]Alright, so that's 2, 3, 4.
[94:15.47]Or we could do 2 and then 3.
[94:17.41]It could be you!
[94:21.87]It's gonna be you.
[94:24.01]I'm not gonna draw my whole deck.
[94:27.71]Here's what we're gonna do.
[94:29.45]You ready?
[94:37.72]Ooh.
[94:38.08]Add a toxin to your hand.
[94:40.34]Nice.
[94:40.56]Plus one attack in rush.
[94:41.74]Discover a spell.
[94:42.94]Now you... draw a card and then... I got a three.
[95:09.49]I'm not going to draw the rest of the deck.
[95:12.31]That's going to kill me.
[95:14.17]I'm going to start taking fatigue damage.
[95:15.81]One attack would still be... Here's what I'm going to do.
[95:19.55]Hehehe.
[95:41.89]Ooh, that's nice.
[96:04.72]You shouldn't have cleared.
[96:05.94]Well, that was scary.
[96:07.14]I had to... See, now he... Look, what are you going to do?
[96:13.97]This is how I can take care of this.
[96:22.14]Set the attack of all minions to one.
[96:23.90]Preparation.
[96:24.64]Find shield.
[96:26.34]Let's see.
[96:29.74]So, everyone has one attack.
[96:31.63]That's not gonna help.
[96:35.13]Prep and draw the deck.
[96:40.43]Are you happy?
[96:41.01]Are you happy?
[96:46.43]Do I have lethal?
[96:51.19]Hold on.
[96:53.05]That's four, eight, cold blood.
[97:04.79]So I, let me see, hold on.
[97:05.85]Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[97:09.76]Do I have lethal?
[97:11.14]Eight, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, I got lethal.
[97:23.74]Holy shit, a ton of subs just came in.
[97:25.51]I don't have lethal?
[97:30.33]Why did I just think I had lethal?
[97:36.59]Why do I just... Why did somebody tell me I had lethal?
[97:40.04]I'm not supposed to be looking at the chatroom.
[97:46.40]Oh, goddammit.
[97:47.44]It's alright, I'm gonna win.
[97:50.43]20 community subs just came in.
[97:53.62]Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[97:55.64]Great Canadian.
[97:56.74]Fuck Club.
[97:58.90]Thank you so much.
[98:04.38]Oh, no.
[98:09.41]Oh, this is perfect.
[98:23.61]What are you gonna do about that?
[98:30.28]Ow!
[98:53.97]Big brain, big brain, big brain.
[98:56.05]Oh, nice card you got.
[99:13.56]I've never played this game before.
[99:14.63]I have no idea what the fuck is happening.
[99:18.43]Well, I can probably join that boat with you.
[99:21.39]But anyways, the Great Canadian Frick Club seriously gave... That's a lot of money.
[99:25.41]Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[99:27.44]There was also $50 earlier from Toxray.
[99:33.38]Thank you for the $50 fucking dollars.
[99:35.72]And they said, play against Stir at least once.
[99:38.53]No, he plays this game all the time.
[99:40.09]That would be a mistake.
[99:41.77]Which one?
[99:45.37]Master Scheme, Super Simeon Sphere, and Flyby.
[99:56.41]Shuffle a Kaboombot into your opponent's deck when drawn, it explodes for fit, so you just instantly kill somebody.
[100:08.26]If they draw that, you just win.
[100:10.26]That seems, I mean, that seems pretty cool.
[100:16.11]This is cool.
[100:16.67]Summon King Moogla, give it immune and can't be targeted by spells and hero powers.
[100:22.29]Seems like the, uh... Indecisive to some of you guys.
[100:30.77]But... Gonna have to click on the one that has the most votes.
[100:42.70]What just happened?
[100:44.82]Oh, god damn it.
[100:45.66]We have to do this again.
[100:46.78]For some reason, it reset itself.
[100:50.16]Anybody could click it an infinite amount of times.
[100:51.81]You ready?
[100:52.61]Here it comes.
[100:56.75]This one's for real.
[101:00.81]I looked over, there was like 10,000 clicks.
[101:03.50]People were just like...
[101:14.57]Maybe I'll press that.
[101:16.84]Maybe I'll press this one.
[101:18.92]Super Simian Sphere looks like it's gonna win.
[101:31.51]That is the one.
[101:32.29]Don't worry, don't go anywhere.
[101:33.27]You get to pick again.
[101:46.05]I don't want more combo cards.
[101:55.18]There's like a legendary over here.
[101:56.64]How many coldbloods am I going to have?
[102:09.44]Alright.
[102:10.14]Eviscerate, Cold Blood, and then Vile Spine Slayer.
[102:13.28]Destroy a minion for combo.
[102:14.77]I guess we can take it.
[102:17.83]Oh, this is this thing, right?
[102:22.27]So this is a friendly encounter.
[102:23.31]We get to pick something.
[102:24.61]Or change something.
[102:25.51]You guys can pick this too.
[102:34.41]You get to modify the deck.
[102:36.21]Let's see.
[102:44.02]Alright, so we've got the Shark, the Disciple of C'thun, the Skater Bot, and the Vile Spine.
[102:52.55]And then these up here.
[102:55.69]Lotus Agents, Malygos, and Lower Walker Cho.
[103:01.98]Choose a friendly minion.
[103:02.82]It always starts in your hand, so I can get one of these to always be in the hand.
[103:06.36]Discover a Legendary and add it to the deck.
[103:08.86]Or look at four spells from your deck and reduce one of their costs by three for the whole run.
[103:16.72]Or add everybody and give them all one one.
[103:23.36]Which one do you want me to do?
[103:27.97]I can do two of these.
[103:29.79]Well, the ones that cost.
[103:33.37]I don't think this is going to work without a zoom in.
[103:40.25]Yeah, I don't think this is going to work without me zooming in.
[103:44.04]Hold on just a second here.
[103:56.00]Try it again.
[104:06.51]Add all?
[104:08.25]Or choose a friendly minion and remove it from the deck?
[104:17.61]Looks like we're going to do this one.
[104:20.65]Add all these enemy minions and give them all plus one, plus one.
[104:28.92]Here we go.
[104:34.37]Okay.
[104:38.57]Now what?
[104:43.31]What should I do now?
[104:51.34]Discover a legendary?
[104:53.90]People want me to get rid of... What do you want me to get rid of?
[105:01.21]Alright, let's discover a legendary.
[105:02.37]I mean, everyone's gonna want me to do that, of course.
[105:05.15]Why, you know, why the heck not?
[105:06.77]Oh, you can't go wrong with that one.
[105:08.63]They're irregular.
[105:10.03]Okay, let's zoom out for a second.
[105:16.42]Uh, can you zoom out, please?
[105:23.06]Tack, Nozzwhisker, Ysera, or Mogur the Ogre.
[105:26.22]Huh.
[105:28.12]What do I do here?
[105:32.15]Vogue of the Ogre is terrible.
[105:40.79]Nobody wants tech.
[105:47.41]Not one person.
[105:48.17]Alright, Lucera.
[105:51.67]Anything else you guys would like me to do, or is it time to end?
[105:57.50]Remember, if you click down there, there's only one thing I can do.
[106:06.79]Dismiss, alright.
[106:08.53]Dismiss?
[106:10.37]Who would you like me to dismiss?
[106:12.37]You've got to think, Eudora.
[106:18.96]Oh, fuck.
[106:21.34]Hold on, hold on.
[106:22.18]No, oops!
[106:29.20]Do it again.
[106:29.60]Huh.
[106:33.76]What do I do here?
[106:40.40]Skaterbot, Disciple of Cthulhu, and the shark.
[106:42.96]Dismiss the shark.
[106:45.89]Skaterbot.
[106:46.51]Okay.
[106:46.95]Interesting choice.
[106:47.63]Interesting choice.
[106:49.23]I'm not sure I would have done that.
[106:54.59]Let's go.
[107:00.56]That's why you say, German, that's why you're Chicken League.
[107:02.70]Because you suck.
[107:10.70]but still fun!
[107:13.67]Okay, so this lady, both players summon a minion from their deck and they fight.
[107:20.51]Pretty cool.
[107:26.21]Why are we trying to win?
[107:27.31]I don't know, because sometimes winning is fun.
[107:34.30]I do have both those dragons.
[107:41.42]13-5 because they've swapped.
[107:43.68]You can't hold it, Ysera.
[107:46.60]No, that's Maliglis.
[107:48.14]You can't hold on to a 9 cost.
[107:49.86]You gotta get somebody in here.
[107:54.00]No, I gotta get rid of... No, I can't do that.
[107:56.94]Not this early.
[107:58.62]I need, like, a minion.
[108:03.60]Hold it or die!
[108:05.56]Wow, that was... There we go, there's Cho!
[108:09.40]Immediately play Cho.
[108:19.67]A 5-1 Lorewalker Cho.
[108:23.03]Thank God I did the 1-1, otherwise he would just be dead.
[108:25.50]You wouldn't be able to play him.
[108:32.36]Perfect.
[108:33.96]Let's go.
[108:41.52]I'll take it.
[108:51.20]He's immediately dead.
[108:54.31]Okay, so, um, I could do that to him.
[108:57.01]Or I could do... Maybe I should just put out- no.
[109:11.29]Just combo, eviscerate.
[109:14.77]I could just... Yeah, I could.
[109:20.24]Yeah, fuck it.

[111:27.26]Three.
[111:27.50]Yeah, I get lethal.

[112:07.94]Pretty good win there.
[112:10.40]See, aren't you guys having fun?
[112:12.50]It's fun just to play these little games.
[112:19.64]Hooper says no.
[112:24.02]Remove them.
[112:36.45]Oh, what do you think?
[112:36.93]Should I get two more Eviscerates?
[112:43.17]There are too many to ban.
[112:44.67]They're rising up.
[112:46.03]It's the mutiny.
[112:46.97]It's this stream.
[112:51.47]That's a lot of Van Cleefs.
[112:56.53]And we get a Sneeds, too.
[112:57.45]That's pretty good.
[112:58.11]I agree.
[113:07.10]Uh, passive hero power.
[113:08.04]You choose one card and powers have both effects combined.
[113:12.08]What's going on here?
[113:26.87]So how much more difficult is heroic from here?
[113:44.96]It's really, really hard, right?
[113:46.62]I don't think I can handle that.
[113:58.88]It's baby mode.
[113:59.96]Heroic is very easy and much harder than this.
[114:09.15]What?
[114:09.77]What does that mean?
[114:10.85]What?
[114:13.09]Uh, let's just get a minion out.
[114:21.73]No!
[114:25.05]May as well just concede.
[114:29.15]It's like you were saying last night.
[114:30.25]This is baby mode Captain Crunch Hearthstone.
[114:34.30]But that's alright.
[114:35.08]There's nothing wrong with that.
[114:39.30]I think I have to just get rid of this.
[114:40.42]Hmm.
[114:48.48]What do I do here?
[114:51.14]Let me cast that again.
[114:52.42]At a random target.
[114:55.08]Preparation into... Oh, yeah.
[114:58.45]Preparation into Jade Shuriken.
[115:05.01]Preparation draw deck.
[115:06.35]I'm not doing that.
[115:17.52]I couldn't even do that.
[115:24.71]Ooh, okay, hold on.
[115:28.41]Nope.
[115:29.23]Nope.
[115:31.29]Nope, I'm... No!
[115:36.39]Corrupt every minion, destroy them at the start of your next turn.
[115:48.54]No, no, I can't... Why would I do that right now?
[115:52.06]Destroy them at the start of my next turn.
[115:55.35]That is really good.
[115:56.73]But... See, now I would use it.
[116:01.20]Because that thing is stealth.
[116:03.00]Click the towers.
[116:03.96]Oh, it's a Futurama theme.
[116:05.30]Nice.
[116:25.07]Okay, uh, I'm gonna do this.
[116:27.57]And then I'm gonna put out... I don't know, maybe I shouldn't do that.
[116:32.47]Yeah.
[116:33.19]Where's the, uh... He's just gonna end up killing it.
[116:42.98]Let's just get the fucking shark out here.
[116:51.80]Pretty good.
[117:04.91]Okay.
[117:06.37]Just going for face?
[117:07.27]What's up with that?
[117:12.11]Well, now... That changes things.
[117:20.34]Kill this.
[117:22.04]And then... I don't want to corrupt, though.
[117:29.11]Oh my god, yes.
[117:31.95]Thank you.
[117:32.47]Appreciate it.
[117:35.21]Fading time.
[117:36.67]Let Fading Dragons lie.
[117:45.04]I'm a lot to no good.
[117:54.56]What is that?
[117:56.12]Job's done.
[118:01.20]What?
[118:02.08]What?
[118:05.44]Oh, the death rattle.
[118:06.96]Oh, fuck.
[118:10.74]It's alright, I've got plenty of good cards.
[118:12.57]Alright, we've got one... I can just... Hold on.
[118:17.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[118:18.77]Summon a random two-cost minion... Combo... Could do a couple combos here.
[118:28.97]I don't think this is not lethal you've got to thank you dora 6 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 that is 19. or 18. I'm just gonna do this
[119:08.91]Damn.
[119:09.53]Wish I could do that.
[119:19.55]I'm gonna spread it out.
[119:20.61]I'm gonna spread it out a little.
[119:36.37]I have chosen both paths I travel all roads before me Fuck why did I do that?
[119:54.53]All right, I can do one damage to somebody right one damage to all of the minions
[120:05.78]Alright, get out there, you motherfucker.
[120:13.74]Then I can do... bang.
[120:18.00]Freeze this idiot.
[120:27.37]The jungle provides.
[120:30.70]What a huge play.
[120:36.41]Pretty standard.
[120:37.11]I think he's dead this turn, right?
[120:44.70]You're just gonna heal over and over again?
[120:48.10]Never mind.
[120:48.76]Alright, hold on.
[120:52.32]I'm... Hold on a minute.
[120:54.80]I think I have it.
[120:55.36]6, 8, no, I got it, I got it.
[120:56.40]I need to do this correct.
[120:56.92]6, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
[120:58.12]I need to, yeah.
[120:58.66]He doesn't know?
[120:59.10]I saw it.
[121:26.42]It's not BM if you're against the computer.
[121:27.76]The computer doesn't have any feelings.
[121:31.26]The computer does not have feelings.
[121:36.06]It's mathematical code.
[121:38.32]Alright, what do we want?
[121:47.47]You hurt my feelings.
[121:50.79]You have permanent stealth.
[121:54.57]At the start of your turn, give a random minion in hand, plus one, plus one, or you start with an extra mana crystal.
[121:59.16]That one's good, but boring.
[122:04.76]This one seems broken.
[122:10.93]I think that's the one we're doing.
[122:14.49]Your minions have permanent stealth.
[122:17.48]What?
[122:18.22]Creature box!
[122:26.93]I'm the number three Hearthstone streamer.
[122:31.94]Well, I really might put a disclaimer up that I'm not very good.
[122:36.30]I'm just having fun.
[122:42.17]Two Tharris?
[122:43.35]That makes three Van Cleefs.
[122:46.47]Your title already explains it.
[122:47.75]Yeah, I guess it does.
[122:48.49]I remember when Emperor Tharrissian was like an unbearable...
[122:58.96]He was so good.
[123:05.10]Is he still in every single deck?
[123:14.44]Okay, what we got?
[123:18.66]Always Starts in your hand.
[123:19.86]I could do Van Cleef to Always Start.
[123:23.59]Reduce the cost of a random card in your deck to zero.
[123:30.96]Oh my god, what the hell is this?
[123:32.96]2020?
[123:32.98]What?
[123:35.28]Okay, so...
[123:55.65]that's insane it never happens four mana zero zero yeah you just spend four mana it's just a coin that doesn't do anything but it's four all right well you know what to do
[124:31.31]You're all fired.
[124:33.55]Is that what you guys are clicking on?
[124:39.19]Is that?
[124:39.49]No.
[124:39.89]Is it?
[124:40.21]It is.
[124:42.33]Don't we want a bunch of Van Cleefs?
[124:47.40]We need to... We might need to enhance this again.
[124:55.66]Yeah, I need to enhance it again.
[124:57.20]Go for it.
[125:08.19]Okay, I was about to throw everybody away.
[125:09.82]Alright, so we're gonna take them all into the enemy deck.
[125:16.46]Alright, yeah, let's go for it.
[125:17.92]Take everybody.
[125:18.44]Alright, now what?
[125:25.51]That thing's really interesting, though.
[125:26.53]4 mana, 0-0.
[125:33.51]Unfortunately.
[125:35.29]Unfortunately.
[125:41.41]Alright, that's that one.
[125:45.25]Okay, let's see what it is.
[125:48.49]The thing that we just got.
[125:59.34]Alright, are we good?
[126:04.72]That was four mana, right?
[126:10.53]That's not bad.
[126:17.19]All right, let's go.
[126:22.16]Here we go.
[126:22.54]I'm fucking excited.
[126:24.64]Is anybody else, like, just absolutely boiling with excitement right now?
[126:30.88]And if you're not, then that's pretty doable.
[126:36.11]Okay.
[126:37.23]Summon a 2-2 Treant with Taunt.
[126:46.09]Is that 2 mana?
[126:46.71]No.
[126:54.08]This boss is overpowered.
[126:55.42]Oh, fuck, yeah.
[127:04.72]Guaranteed win right here.
[127:05.90]0, 4, 5.
[127:05.96]Deal 2 damage to all undamaged enemy minions.
[127:09.24]I'm just gonna put it off first.
[127:10.42]Instantly gonna win.
[127:11.04]It's only hard and heroic.
[127:25.33]Save it for clear.
[127:27.69]Ah, but it's so easy just to throw him out there right now.
[127:30.79]Zero mana.
[127:33.03]Ah, okay.
[127:33.99]I'll hold off.
[127:43.44]Okay.
[127:44.88]Steal or draw Deathrattle?
[127:58.16]I went with my gut, that was the wrong idea.
[128:03.72]Okay, now I'm gonna have to play this.
[128:07.06]Oh shit, this is bad.
[128:13.29]Not yet?
[128:14.51]Ah, this is killing me.
[128:17.39]Not yet, but they're getting just too many on the board.
[128:26.53]Do a Chad move and draw the deck.
[128:28.96]No, not yet.
[128:30.94]Oh, fuck.
[128:38.00]Now I'm gonna use it.
[128:43.26]Here we go.
[128:50.95]That is so good.
[128:52.57]That is just... ridiculous.
[129:02.89]Deal two damage to a minion.
[129:04.05]If it survives, give it Poisonous.
[129:07.46]Could do that to somebody on my team.
[129:15.54]What did that do?
[129:17.24]Convert your mana into minions and gain an empty mana crystal.
[129:25.17]Um, okay.
[129:28.15]Still, no, it's not enough.
[129:34.03]That's bad.
[129:40.25]I think I'm just going to put out minions.
[129:47.42]Or, yeah, let's just go with the shark.
[129:59.10]That sucks.
[130:03.54]Can I eat this?
[130:04.32]How many turns can I eat this?
[130:05.98]Never mind.
[130:06.36]Never mind.
[130:07.02]It's all good.
[130:20.60]So now, yeah, it's just a DPS race.
[130:22.84]Let's see, give me something crazy.
[130:25.38]Dammit.
[130:26.86]DPS race, let's go.
[130:28.92]Okay, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.
[130:30.08]Did he just go twice?
[130:49.96]Okay, hold on.
[130:50.24]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[130:50.60]Oh, no!
[130:50.72]I thought that was a pick!
[130:51.68]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[130:53.68]Can I have it back?
[131:22.53]I thought that was like a pa- I thought- I forgot it was a combo.
[131:25.45]It's alright, I'm gonna win.
[131:34.22]Oh, goddammit, that was such a bonehead move.
[131:40.14]Alright, I win.
[131:40.72]Let me think about it.
[131:43.50]4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[131:46.60]I got it.
[131:46.96]It's over.
[131:59.56]Thank you, Khadgar, for the 17 health for no reason.
[132:02.21]Where to?
[132:26.57]Look at all these wins.
[132:28.71]I know.
[132:29.19]Isn't it nice to win and not go 0-3 in Arena?
[132:39.32]So we got... This is the one.
[132:41.66]Unearthed Raptor, Anub'Arak, and N'Zoth the Corrupter.
[132:50.94]All these are so new.
[132:51.92]I've never even seen half of these.
[132:55.34]More Deathrattles.
[132:58.72]Alright.
[132:59.62]Oksana!
[133:02.82]After a minion attacks you, deal 2 damage to it.
[133:08.15]So it's just... every time somebody attacks... Where's Cho?
[133:19.49]We haven't seen Cho in... I don't want to play him.
[133:29.97]So many of these.
[133:30.79]I have too many of these.
[133:38.44]He died last game.
[133:39.88]Thank god.
[133:42.56]Alright, should I hold it?
[133:45.72]I love how he's so nice and helpful.
[133:58.65]Alright, not yet.
[134:02.45]If your deck has only odd cost cards, draw a card.
[134:06.22]Do people build their decks around having odd costs?
[134:16.86]That seems just strange.
[134:20.41]Not anymore?
[134:21.37]It was overpowered before?
[134:23.59]Damn.
[134:27.99]Well, I would put it out, but maybe, is this the opportunity just to get control right here?
[134:35.53]Or do I just send the cat out to die?
[134:40.05]Let's get it right now.
[134:42.55]And then let's get Vancleef out there too.
[134:44.61]You know what I mean?
[134:45.19]Like, fuck it.
[134:46.40]Let the pain speak to me.
[134:59.69]And here we go.
[135:00.47]Rush into the bandits.
[135:07.20]This is a good run.
[135:14.85]Cold Blood on...
[135:21.25]Do I have any heals?
[135:32.65]Shuffle your hand into your deck, draw that many cards.
[135:34.89]What the way you can do that?
[135:37.35]You just throw your hold hand away and... Alright, let me think about this.
[135:44.49]I need to... I just gotta get rid of this.
[135:46.48]I might just have... Hold on, let me think.
[135:52.98]If I could just get rid of this and then face again, or get rid of this and then do another Cold Blood.
[136:02.07]I could pull something.
[136:04.09]Let me pull something.
[136:06.62]Damn it.
[136:08.22]Alright, well now I have to do that.
[136:23.40]Oh, I could have killed it.
[136:30.86]It's okay.
[136:31.34]Don't worry.
[136:35.15]I could have killed it.
[136:36.75]It's alright.
[136:37.21]I still can.
[136:37.71]Everything's fine.
[136:42.19]Two lackeys.
[136:42.98]Alright, let's do the stupid cat.
[136:45.98]And then the...
[136:49.80]lackey or yeah I want the lackeys all right now is it worth doing eight damage to face or should I just hold this forever no I have to do it I have to go to the face behind you fall before me
[137:09.97]Plus one attack and rush, plus one attack and rush.
[137:11.83]I still have this.
[137:14.65]Well, that's not fair.
[137:23.11]Restart your computer.
[137:25.67]Maybe that'll fix it.
[137:37.00]I don't think I want to do any of this.
[137:43.52]I can't, I can't play this.
[137:50.29]This just is a dead card, it just dies.
[137:51.65]Uh, alright, so... Lackey, and then we'll do Bandits.
[138:00.50]And then... I'm gonna give... Cold Blood... To... Somebody.
[138:13.08]Who should I give this to?
[138:15.46]You.
[138:18.00]And then I'm going to trade you to you.
[138:23.10]And everything's going to be fine.
[138:27.62]That's the thing I was talking about.
[138:28.62]Alright, well that's gone immediately.
[138:43.31]I mean, right?
[138:44.15]Like, I... Right?
[138:52.76]I feel like I'm gonna get rid of that, too.
[138:57.12]I have to get rid of this.
[138:58.56]This thing's gonna keep doing this forever.
[139:03.72]Faces good damage, but... He's gonna keep bringing everybody in here.
[139:18.01]If this minion survives damage, I'm going to copy.
[139:19.63]Don't do the spin thing.
[139:24.03]Combo destroy a minion.
[139:25.31]Perfect.
[139:26.69]Lacky.
[139:28.13]Into.
[139:28.57]Yeah.
[139:29.03]Lacky.
[139:31.35]Destroy the 5-3.
[139:33.20]And then we're going to go like this.
[139:42.80]Goodbye, you!
[139:45.50]And then we hold.
[139:46.84]What?
[139:47.46]Yeah.
[139:47.78]Because they'll just die.
[140:12.11]Play the totem.
[140:13.69]Watch, the totem dies.
[140:15.63]It doesn't do anything.
[140:18.68]Well, here we go.
[140:20.40]Give me something good.
[140:23.96]That's really fucking good.
[140:32.55]Here we go!
[140:33.23]Oh, damn it.
[140:50.29]What's going on?
[140:52.73]Hey!
[141:15.55]There it is.
[141:16.37]Summon King Mukla.
[141:17.83]Give it immune and can't be targeted by spells or hero powers.
[141:23.83]Thanks, Khadgar.
[141:24.75]I appreciate it.
[141:25.41]Now it doesn't even matter.
[141:32.12]If I have... I think I win.
[141:36.06]What is he doing?
[141:44.15]Why did he just do all that at the very end here?
[141:46.33]Thanks for nothing for the first, like, 12 turns.
[141:51.41]What do you guys think?
[142:06.92]How am I this good?
[142:09.56]Well, takes a lot of practice.
[142:16.52]Alright, shuffle five random treasures into your deck.
[142:18.74]I don't think I've ever even seen what this does.
[142:22.88]Take an extra turn.
[142:23.84]Your opponent takes an extra turn after.
[142:25.48]That kind of sucks.
[142:29.92]This one's pretty good.
[142:30.86]Draw this every turn.
[142:32.02]At the start of every game, you draw this.
[142:34.04]It has Taunt.
[142:35.76]And it gets plus one, plus one every turn it's in my hand.
[142:43.44]Well, I'm taking this.
[142:48.65]What do you think?
[142:50.29]We're getting close to the last, like, two or three.
[142:53.27]Usually the last two or three are usually pretty hard.
[142:56.54]They're just so... just random all over the place, and it's hard to... beat them sometimes, and I don't... this is kind of split here.
[143:04.82]58, 28, there we go.
[143:09.85]Draw!
[143:10.81]You want me to start getting some draw.
[143:12.89]Okay.
[143:16.37]Is this the last one?
[143:20.65]We got some pretty good shit, though.
[143:23.97]Okay.
[143:27.39]Now this is it.
[143:34.57]Coat a minion in Blast Powder when it takes damage destroyed.
[143:37.28]I remember this.
[143:39.50]There's something... There's some wires and stuff.
[143:42.20]I'm gonna fuck this up.
[143:49.68]Yeah, if these two wires touch, you take five damage at the beginning of the turn or something.
[143:55.73]But the stealth is just so overpowered.
[144:07.75]Permanent stealth against this character?
[144:12.47]It will never activate.
[144:15.62]It's never gonna activate when I get him out there.
[144:19.44]That's so funny.
[144:22.98]And he's not gonna be able to do it.
[144:27.00]Uh, alright, well let's... The only time that this card has ever been useful is right now.
[144:43.66]Well, I can't really do anything, so...
[144:47.09]And I got Ragnaros.
[144:48.53]Random Ragnaros Light Lord.
[144:51.17]It's impossible for me to lose.
[144:55.45]It just isn't.
[144:57.05]There's no way.
[144:57.53]It's impossible.
[145:03.27]Okay, but hold on.
[145:11.76]Don't get too overconfident because I still have to do this.
[145:18.55]I still have to get here, so... This is actually a really terrible start.
[145:29.92]4, 1... This is bad.
[145:40.74]If I play the Miscreant, I'm not going to get the combo though, and he's just going to
[145:46.19]I guess it makes sense.
[145:54.63]He's starting to load up to a point where I actually might lose.
[146:03.20]I'm getting way too high cost cards.
[146:05.94]This is very bad.
[146:06.72]Alright, four... Who's... Okay, I gotta get rid of you.
[146:12.71]So I got to take out you.
[146:15.22]So we're going to do that with cold blood.
[146:19.64]You've got to think, Eudora.
[146:25.32]That will give me able to clear it.
[146:27.20]OK, that's what I'm doing.
[146:31.46]Evil!
[146:38.49]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[146:39.77]It's OK.
[146:46.69]Why steal the city when you can just blow it up instead?
[146:51.85]It's fine, everything's gonna- It's alright, I can- It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[146:57.94]I'm just gonna get the darkness out there and everything's gonna be fine.
[147:10.49]Fuck.
[147:10.59]Boom!
[147:10.71]Oh, no, should I do King- King Vukla?
[147:12.33]Maybe I should just do King Vukla.
[147:18.17]Or... It doesn't work like that?
[147:23.30]That won't work?
[147:26.44]Oh, it spawns over here.
[147:28.38]Oh, Jesus.
[147:29.44]Okay.
[147:30.14]Does this count as a minion?
[147:31.22]Okay, for a second I don't... Does this count as a minion?
[147:48.29]I just gotta make it to round eight.
[147:49.44]Alright, this is how we do this.
[147:53.58]We go.
[147:55.20]Bang.
[147:59.45]Knuckles?
[148:00.11]No, I need to get rid of... I'm just gonna shuriken the zombie.
[148:05.23]And then I'm gonna eviscerate him.
[148:20.39]And then steal.
[148:23.45]What the hell happened?
[148:26.65]Oh, come on!
[148:38.51]Thank God nobody was stealthed, that's not a stealth card.
[148:48.33]Alright, now we've got...
[148:51.69]King Mukla now?
[148:53.61]Or... Yeah, that's time for Mukla.
[149:11.54]What?
[149:13.88]Why are you doing this?
[149:14.85]Oh my god, this is so bad for him!
[149:18.40]That was so bad.
[149:19.97]Holy shit, that was terrible.
[149:21.87]That's the... Hey, is that... Hey, is that Germadon85 playing on the other team?
[149:26.37]Wait, hold on.
[149:35.56]Ragnaros time.
[149:37.52]No, I can't lose!
[149:38.62]Oh, that was a voice crack.
[149:40.66]It's okay.
[149:49.42]Now I'm fine.
[150:13.58]How do I take care of that?
[150:14.56]What do I do about this?
[150:16.20]Hold on.
[150:20.00]I can't have him taunting because he has permanent stealth.
[150:27.20]Nobody can taunt because they're stealthed.
[150:39.87]I lose.
[150:43.51]I'm actually going to lose because I can't...
[150:53.17]Put on the weapon.
[150:57.39]Play Edwin.
[151:00.05]Just attack with it.
[151:01.27]But he's in trouble.
[151:06.98]Yeet him.
[151:07.60]The Brotherhood shall prevail.
[151:31.06]7, 8, 9, 10, 11!
[151:34.34]It's not- I gotta- What, is this gonna counterspell me?
[151:51.67]Alright.
[151:53.09]We're okay.
[151:53.65]We're back to normal.
[152:11.56]I'm so... I'm, like, scared.
[152:16.76]Can you draw a candle already, please?
[152:20.61]Thank you for that.
[152:21.69]I'll take it.
[152:23.41]Shuffle five random treasures into your deck!
[152:26.93]Alright, give me these.
[152:29.51]I have 28 cards in my deck!
[152:30.97]I'm never gonna see those!
[152:37.15]I can't even kill this!
[152:39.05]Four, five... I'm gonna...
[152:46.18]Where's the... Discover a Druid Rogha Shaman card.
[152:51.28]Let's see.
[152:54.84]Deal two damage to the enemy hero.
[152:57.40]If you control a Treant, discover his spell.
[152:59.31]When you overload, I don't... Headcrack is the only thing I can do.
[153:07.13]And then... Just get out the Raptor?
[153:21.83]Well, give me the heal.
[153:25.99]Now draw the fucking candles.
[153:37.04]What'd I just get?
[153:41.52]What's going on?
[153:43.74]Your opponent summons a minion from their deck and I got Sneed.
[153:48.28]Alright, hold on.
[153:53.60]Do I have, like, one damage?
[153:55.14]Is it gonna, like, speed?
[153:58.40]Give me the shit.
[153:59.80]Okay.
[154:00.00]What?
[154:13.77]Go dormant?
[154:15.03]Play four cards?
[154:16.53]What's with all this dormant shit?
[154:20.35]I need to make space.
[154:21.63]Oh, right.
[154:22.05]I have to make space.
[154:23.43]Let's kill this guy.
[154:26.42]And then you die here.
[154:27.90]So now there's enough space.
[154:34.08]And then Thaurissan.
[154:41.95]I'm in a pretty good spot now.
[154:43.63]This should be it.
[154:47.07]Three in a row.
[154:50.89]Holy fuck, that would have been awesome.
[154:58.69]Alright, so now... Just give me that.
[155:01.53]Now... We're gonna... just load him up.
[155:16.79]Whatever.
[155:30.01]Doesn't matter, motherfucker.
[155:32.81]It doesn't matter.
[155:43.89]Draw two minions from your deck.
[155:47.11]Set their attack health and cost to one?
[155:48.83]This is baby shit.
[155:53.52]Uh-oh.
[155:54.86]No, he's not scared.
[155:55.52]Alright, do I win with an extra turn?
[156:04.36]That's seven.
[156:05.99]Fourteen.
[156:07.65]No.
[156:09.49]I don't win with an extra turn.
[156:11.93]I gotta clear this, though, because he has no cards.
[156:16.00]I gotta play this right.
[156:17.70]Three damage.
[156:19.26]So, get your text off the screen.
[156:21.32]I'm trying to focus.
[156:25.72]Head crack.
[156:26.38]I don't win with head crack.
[156:28.82]Two turns of 26 head... What do you mean?
[156:31.00]Wait, what?
[156:38.44]It is lethal.
[156:40.54]Seven, fourteen...
[156:43.21]19... 24... 20... What happened?
[157:14.03]What happened?
[157:15.63]Oh, okay.
[157:27.65]Oh fuck!
[157:28.47]I'm misclicking!
[157:35.07]I thought I had to do it afterwards or something.
[157:43.72]LOL, LOL, so funny.
[157:45.34]Hey, run complete.
[157:46.22]I did it with Rogue.
[157:48.32]This is fun.
[157:49.53]Hooray.
[157:49.71]Alright, again.
[158:02.29]I promised Rafaam that we will... Now do that on Heroic.
[158:06.64]I'm not ready for Heroic.
[158:09.52]Such beautiful creatures.
[158:12.98]We must unleash them.
[158:15.76]I'm not ready for Heroic.
[158:16.90]You are?
[158:17.32]Alright, I'll try it once.
[158:19.16]The bank of Taloran.
[158:24.76]You be distracting all the guards.
[158:26.94]We be taking all the goods.
[158:31.30]Heroic mode increases the difficulty of all the bosses.
[158:35.94]Okay.
[158:37.84]Chapter one, heroic.
[158:40.68]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[158:42.27]I'm not ready for this.
[158:51.77]Play anomaly mode?
[158:53.05]What is anomaly mode?
[158:59.70]Alright, we got Druid.
[159:05.66]Looks like people want to see Druid.
[159:08.19]Anomaly is more random rules.
[159:09.99]Oh, that's cool.
[159:10.43]Alright, we're going to do Druid.
[159:18.41]I'm going to pee, so you guys can pick.
[159:23.65]There's nothing for you to pick, so never mind.
[159:27.36]And there's just this.
[159:31.39]Okay.
[159:32.43]Well, I'm not going to pee yet.
[159:33.61]Let me see if I can get through the first person.
[159:35.89]Okay, so this is... Swap the leftmost card in each player's hand with one in their deck.
[159:48.08]So you just... Everybody on the left swaps out.
[159:51.64]Let's see if I can even do the first level.
[159:59.21]I'm not embarrassed if I can't do this on heroic.
[160:03.38]Okay, I will.
[160:07.26]After this.
[160:08.22]He's gonna get embarrassed.
[160:09.52]Maybe.
[160:09.96]This is the one with the coins in the middle.
[160:25.64]Alright, what do you think?
[160:26.66]After this minion attacks a hero, add a copy of it to your hand.
[160:28.92]That's not bad.
[160:29.58]Add two 1-1 squirrels.
[160:33.05]Yeah, definitely this.
[160:38.33]Oh shit, you're gonna pull that.
[160:39.57]Oh, it's alright.
[160:40.45]Give a friendly minion 1-1, then gain armor equal to its attack.
[160:56.72]Shit.
[161:05.97]I need to play this.
[161:08.15]Because this is going to disappear.
[161:16.29]I already lost.
[161:19.17]And then give this to the 1-1 so it can't die from here.
[161:28.66]Yeah, let's try it.
[161:30.12]I'm not gonna attack.
[161:36.18]That's actually really good.
[161:37.92]I'm happy that just happened.
[161:40.36]Minus two attack until your next turn.
[161:43.18]What the fuck?
[161:50.01]After you summon a minion, give it plus one, plus one.
[161:57.67]Shit.
[162:01.83]I'm just gonna have to, uh, it's... Do I even attack?
[162:09.05]She's gonna kill me.
[162:21.66]Shit!
[162:21.98]Okay, that's not horrible.
[162:33.37]Gain six time recruited minion that costs four or less.
[162:37.13]Or do I shapeshift into this?
[162:39.16]Because then they'll get okay, and then...
[163:00.78]That's pretty good.
[163:01.50]Should I do them all?
[163:04.68]All right, this is where it gets to be.
[163:10.61]I have to get rid of that.
[163:27.29]Value trade 3-2 and face with 2-1.
[163:31.33]Yeah.
[163:34.55]Yeah.
[163:36.43]Thank you, guy in the chat!
[163:38.35]Appreciate all that good stuff that you just told me.
[163:46.66]You know, it's heroic, so I'm just... I don't know why my brain is like, no, no, no, everything needs to be... Be careful, I need help.
[163:54.86]I think that's it.
[163:56.40]Yeah, that's it.
[164:03.93]That was easy.
[164:04.53]It was.
[164:05.43]I'm overthinking things.
[164:06.39]Alright, I'm gonna pee.
[164:08.23]While you vote for the, uh... So difficult.
[164:10.69]There you go.
[164:15.30]Let's see what it's gonna be.
[164:19.66]Draw two cards at the start of the game.
[164:21.84]Gain two armor when somebody dies.
[164:25.02]Or your death rattles trigger twice.
[164:31.13]Which one?
[164:33.15]How many death rattles do I have?
[164:36.49]I think one or two.
[164:39.82]Two.
[164:44.00]Three.
[164:53.16]Alright, yeah, I mean, if we're gonna pick this, then we're gonna go straight up Deathrattle.
[164:59.70]Is there Deathrattle here?
[165:06.78]Rule... Well, there is one.
[165:13.71]The Mulch Muncher?
[165:22.39]Big friends.
[165:26.47]Summon a minion from your hand with five or more attack.
[165:30.41]Yeah, this doesn't do anything for us, unfortunately.
[165:34.39]But Gruul is just Gruul.
[165:38.27]Yeah, that sucks.
[165:39.03]Summon five minions with five or more attack.
[165:43.04]And we have to start working on this shit, too.
[165:50.60]Well, the people want Gruul.
[165:56.56]So they're going to get Gruul.
[165:58.58]Alright, LAP.
[166:00.13]I'll be right back.
[166:03.79]Have I been playing Hearthstone for three hours?
[166:05.77]Damn.
[166:08.03]I'm having fun, though.
[166:09.29]It's a fun game.
[166:11.55]When you have 3,500 people help you make decisions on every play.
[166:17.80]It's fun.
[166:18.12]I'll be right back.
[169:42.20]Okay.
[169:44.38]Sorry I was gone for a little bit longer.
[169:48.61]I wanted to get a drink, because it's been like four hours and I haven't really had anything to drink, so... I had coffee sitting here.
[170:00.26]But I needed something a little more substantial.
[170:02.10]Alright, let's go.
[170:08.04]What's the drink?
[170:08.62]It is just a sparkling water.
[170:13.13]It's not anything too interesting.
[170:23.46]Just a little bit of bubbles.
[170:25.36]Alright, so do I even play this shit?
[170:27.42]I don't think I even have these in my deck.
[170:42.02]Pineapple juice is gonna kill you, you know.
[170:44.18]Ooh, that's good.
[170:46.48]Alright, what does he do?
[170:51.12]Add a random magical feat to your hand.
[170:53.84]Alright, so he puts feet in his hand.
[170:58.54]So, deathrattle's triggered twice.
[171:00.18]Let's get the... Let's get him out there.
[171:04.32]You're all done.
[171:15.09]Get that.
[171:15.59]Ooh.
[171:20.52]Give you minions one, one.
[171:22.98]Well, this thing is free, so here, just play it.
[171:26.00]Alright, summon two.
[171:27.96]Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[171:30.84]Or... Yeah, let's just get rid of this.
[171:35.29]Do I want the one, one?
[171:37.39]No, because it's twin spell.
[171:38.85]Did it bring out the trance?
[171:39.85]Let's bring them all out.
[171:43.41]Cool.
[171:47.64]I'm going for it.
[171:50.12]I'm going for a kill.
[171:51.58]Immediately.
[171:52.18]What the hell is this?
[172:03.11]Alright, that was a good outcome.
[172:08.17]Jesus.
[172:08.63]Give a friendly minion 1-1, then gain attack equal... armor equal to its attack.
[172:14.41]So... I gotta think about this here.
[172:18.27]So we'll get... Two... Two... And then I can get rid of that.
[172:28.24]Alright, so... Hold on.
[172:34.48]I can... Two... Fucking goddamn math!
[172:41.95]I can't do math!
[172:42.83]Yes, I can.
[172:44.59]oh you're just building suspense smile nuts to you got one got one
[173:14.87]Was that wrong?
[173:15.67]That was a... That was okay.
[173:20.53]That wasn't completely wrong, was it?
[173:23.97]Was it wrong?
[173:24.60]No, it was right.
[173:25.40]It was a little bit wrong.
[173:31.08]It wasn't that wrong.
[173:31.90]It was okay.
[173:32.46]Alright.
[173:36.46]Oh, this is... I can do this twice.
[173:38.85]Again.
[173:39.03]So we're gonna 1, 1.
[173:39.89]On 2.
[173:45.45]Six armor, that's insane.
[173:48.23]I think I, do I, do I have it?
[173:50.50]Two, three, four, five.
[173:53.04]Six, seven, eight.
[173:56.74]No, I don't have it.
[174:04.10]Oh, it's all minions.
[174:05.90]Oh, it's all, I thought it was give a minion.
[174:09.98]Oh.
[174:16.33]Alright.
[174:16.79]Mystical wonders!
[174:22.59]Three mana, give a minion 1-1.
[174:23.59]Yeah, that would be absolute dogshit.
[174:24.55]What the hell am I talking about?
[174:42.17]Look at how desperate he is right now.
[174:43.37]He's trying so hard.
[174:44.21]He's just gonna lose.
[174:53.57]Presto legendaro!
[174:55.49]Presto majesto.
[174:59.00]Am I gonna get to play?
[175:01.60]Jesus.
[175:17.56]Get that squirrel BM.
[175:18.88]Not a big deal.
[175:22.68]Alright.
[175:24.94]What do you guys think?
[175:29.54]Do you not need to kill the gold treasure thing?
[175:32.36]No, what it does is it gives both players two coins.
[175:37.23]So, you know, you could.
[175:43.74]Time for arena.
[175:45.68]No, that was so embarrassing.
[175:47.12]That just was so... I can't.
[175:50.62]I can't do that again.
[175:51.42]Alright, what do we got?
[175:53.32]Big friends.
[175:57.76]Should we try it one more time before I stop?
[176:01.46]I have to redeem myself.
[176:02.57]Yeah, alright.
[176:03.33]I'll try it.
[176:04.17]Not now.
[176:05.91]After like another run or two.
[176:08.87]I'm still having fun.
[176:11.37]It's just fun just to... I'm not very good.
[176:14.59]How many times is he going to say he's not good?
[176:16.45]Alright, we'll take this.
[176:25.40]The Amazing Boomer.
[176:28.36]Cast a random spell that was cast this game, chosen randomly on targets.
[176:32.46]Okay, cool.
[176:35.95]Interesting.
[176:47.99]Alright, I still don't have enough.
[176:58.87]Maybe I do now.
[177:02.57]How many minions do I have over five attack?
[177:08.15]I think I have it now.
[177:10.83]But they're all late game cards.
[177:19.77]What happened to Cooking Simulator?
[177:21.11]Unfortunately, I had the release date wrong.
[177:23.77]The game doesn't actually launch until tomorrow.
[177:26.97]So, I figured, hey, I'm just gonna play Hearthstone for some reason.
[177:35.13]Odd that that's the thing that decided- I just felt like it.
[177:39.93]And on this channel, we just do anything.
[177:43.13]Even if it's to the detriment of my channel.
[177:45.99]It doesn't matter.
[177:48.99]Uh, anyway, let's go with the... What are you doing?
[177:56.96]Alright.
[178:00.46]That used to be my favorite card in the game.
[178:10.07]I used to love that thing.
[178:12.91]Doesn't seem like a detriment.
[178:14.01]No, I'm just kidding around.
[178:16.25]I'm just kidding around.
[178:19.95]1-1, and then gain his attack and armor.
[178:22.23]Maybe I should do it to you.
[178:24.27]And get the coins, and then do... That's what I'm going for?
[178:28.99]Could be the wrong play.
[178:31.33]Might be the wrong play, but it's what I'm going to do.
[178:40.26]Okay.
[178:50.59]Have you ever played... tried... what is... I don't know what's... Hearthstone?
[179:02.38]A good way to win at Hearthstone?
[179:05.36]I feel like that's a... is it a thing?
[179:06.94]I'm not saying that.
[179:08.18]I don't know if that is... what am I... I'm not reading that.
[179:18.88]It starts with an S. Okay, I don't know what that is.
[179:21.60]And I almost said I don't know what it is.
[179:23.92]Well, that's a perfect exact mana cost card.
[179:31.59]It's a mage secret?
[179:33.09]Oh, shit.
[179:36.01]Um... It's... What is it?
[179:38.77]It's gonna be, like, vaporized, right?
[179:40.13]It's vaporized.
[179:52.77]So many squirrels.
[179:54.05]It's not a beast?
[179:57.04]Damn.
[180:01.24]Twin spell?
[180:01.78]No, I can't do that.
[180:02.90]Um... All squirrels?
[180:12.33]And then get vaporized?
[180:15.00]All squirrels, and then... Wait a minute.
[180:17.77]Holy shit.
[180:21.39]Calm down.
[180:27.47]Let's see what this is.
[180:31.09]Three... Hold on, hold on.
[180:33.50]Five, four, five, four, five, six.
[180:37.78]So then should I get twin spell twice on the squirrel?
[180:40.04]No.
[181:11.50]Oh shit, you motherfucker!
[181:13.94]You just ruined everything!
[181:15.26]Why?
[181:19.45]Oh no!
[181:20.67]It's alright, I can do it next turn.
[181:21.71]I can twin spell it next turn.
[181:22.97]He's not gonna kill all this.
[181:33.78]Yeah, coining... Nevermind.
[181:37.28]This is bad now.
[181:37.94]At least I get two of them.
[181:46.05]Actually, it's a good thing I didn't do this.
[181:47.89]Although, man, it sucks.
[181:50.36]Too bad I still don't... I wish I had that fucking other coin.
[181:52.70]I could have done Gruul this turn.
[181:53.78]That's not a B. I just have to get the tiger out there again and then... Oh, look at this loser.
[182:11.52]What'd you say to me?
[182:12.88]Someday I'll be just like you!
[182:15.58]We have many secrets.
[182:20.69]I got lots of armor.
[182:25.38]None of these beasts.
[182:30.48]Alright, Coin Gruul or Coin Chromaggus?
[182:32.74]I'm going to say Coin Gruul.
[182:46.88]And then I use... Ah, hold on.
[182:55.32]Should I get rid of the Sorcerer's Apprentice or get rid of the Carantor Mage?
[182:59.88]I'm going to say Mage.
[183:05.65]Or I could just hit him.
[183:06.83]Hopefully that was right.
[183:07.55]I didn't trade.
[183:10.23]Not good.
[183:12.81]Should have traded.
[183:20.31]I was supposed to trade.
[183:21.57]And now it's going to come back and bite me.
[183:29.13]Fromagus is gone, didn't get to do it once.
[183:30.89]If you control three minions with seven health, it deals seven damage to all enemies.
[183:42.68]Well, it's time to roll.
[183:51.86]Ouch.
[183:56.54]God.
[183:58.78]Fuck.
[184:03.28]Um, this is so bad.
[184:07.96]Put SP in the title, or I'm... This is not... Nobody gets sponsored to play Hearthstone.
[184:17.10]What a... I think I'm just gonna go with the 777.
[184:23.82]That's a lie?
[184:24.56]Do people actually get sponsored by Blizzard?
[184:30.22]I'm just going with 7.
[184:31.80]Blizzard pays people to play this game.
[184:37.87]Not like tournaments, like actually just to stream it.
[184:51.96]Oh, it means single player.
[185:00.62]I just, like, jumped immediately to conclusions on that one.
[185:09.59]Did you use the Twitch bounty?
[185:11.23]No, no, I don't, I don't, I don't, no.
[185:13.19]I did this because I'm a fucking moron.
[185:15.98]And this is my own dumb decision.
[185:18.96]I'm gonna own my own shitty decisions.
[185:21.32]This is a good decision.
[185:23.36]Plus, I win.
[185:24.58]The game's over.
[185:26.95]Eight?
[185:28.17]Nine?
[185:28.53]Not yet.
[185:32.26]Is that a beast?
[185:36.80]Do the bounty now.
[185:38.10]There is no bounty.
[185:38.88]I don't have a bounty for Hearthstone.
[185:40.71]I don't have a bounty for Hearthstone.
[185:50.89]Look to the skies.
[186:03.18]Knowledge is power and I know a lot.
[186:06.99]Yeah, I don't have a bounty a bounty for fun stuff Well, I can't do this yet we get to do this Next turn
[186:35.11]Did we get to win?
[186:35.63]Did we quest?
[186:44.05]That's going to be too late.
[186:46.76]Why not now?
[186:47.42]Nobody died?
[186:54.98]Free as an enemy?
[187:05.60]Well, now I'm gonna do this.
[187:12.64]Never mind.
[187:19.66]Shuffle it back in!
[187:22.28]Twin spell?
[187:23.96]Quest now.
[187:25.10]Twin spell.
[187:25.96]Make it so I stay alive.
[187:47.69]No, that's too much spell damage.
[187:48.75]You don't have anything in your hand.
[187:52.93]Nothing.
[187:53.99]Yes.
[187:55.40]Hooray!
[188:00.68]Oh, come on.
[188:01.26]Hit me in the face fucking five times.
[188:07.02]That was so dumb.
[188:08.98]Oh, God.
[188:09.48]Your minions cost one.
[188:12.34]Well, that's good.
[188:13.14]I'm glad.
[188:14.36]I win.
[188:17.80]Yeah, it's a guaranteed victory.
[188:30.11]Unless you Pyroblast me or something somehow.
[188:36.20]Am I gonna lose?
[188:37.04]No.
[188:37.30]I just won.
[188:38.96]Oh yeah.
[188:41.94]I always have to do the BM on the computer, because it doesn't matter.
[188:54.69]Rogue isn't that bad.
[189:04.84]The enemy's fatigued because he's so slow.
[189:06.62]But I play slow.
[189:09.06]What are we thinking?
[189:14.01]50 damage to guaranteed win and a random 1 out of 30 chance?
[189:19.83]Or... Add 3 random cards to your hand and they all cost 0.
[189:23.21]That's fucking incredible.
[189:25.57]Deal 4 damage to all minions and you shuffle it back in.
[189:28.73]These are all good.
[189:30.25]But you're gonna make me pick the meme card.
[189:32.52]So...
[189:40.33]all enemy minions, and it's a deathrattle and we get it twice.
[189:43.05]You really want me to do the joke card?
[189:45.65]That would ne- We're not gonna see that the whole rest of the run.
[189:47.73]Guarantee it.
[189:55.74]Oh, god damn it.
[189:56.60]Why do the clicks do this?
[190:02.76]There's been like f- I- I'm not changing any settings.
[190:05.38]There's been like 5,000 clicks.
[190:07.61]You can't- No.
[190:08.49]Ah, whatever.
[190:11.76]That's alright.
[190:20.92]Elder won.
[190:22.18]Yeah.
[190:22.88]Elder is still winning.
[190:25.42]I mean, that's... That's amazing.
[190:30.08]Or that too is so good.
[190:32.28]Alright.
[190:32.74]The people have spoken.
[190:37.02]The muscle is probably the best card here.
[190:39.68]But Elder... That...
[190:42.08]I mean, come on.
[190:42.76]That's unbelievable.
[190:48.02]Please continue to make your selection.
[190:50.79]Fake Friends, Pharaoh Bite, or Legends?
[190:57.09]Two Avianas?
[190:59.83]Aviana?
[191:00.27]I don't really like Aviana.
[191:02.33]You have to wait until the very end of the game to be able to throw up shit all over your board.
[191:09.18]You already lost at that point.
[191:12.35]Big Bad Archmage.
[191:17.63]That's pretty good.
[191:22.04]Summon a 5-5 Ironhide Runt.
[191:26.12]Two Bites.
[191:26.78]That's not bad either.
[191:27.54]These are all good.
[191:29.78]Cenarius is good.
[191:30.74]Loatheb is really good.
[191:31.72]I remember Loatheb.
[191:32.58]He was, like, one of the best cards.
[191:33.56]Alright, we're gonna go with, uh... Big Friends.
[191:41.22]Bite sucks.
[191:48.88]Is this bite bad?
[191:49.94]Hey, welcome.
[191:56.53]I can do better than that.
[191:57.51]No, I shouldn't.
[191:59.05]Just stop.
[192:01.19]Sometimes you gotta take the fucking loss.
[192:06.96]What do you guys think?
[192:11.33]I only get to do what?
[192:14.31]I can only do... Oh, it's because it's heroic.
[192:22.85]Choose an enemy minion and add it to your deck or give a friendly minion plus two, plus two.
[192:26.71]We just do them both.
[192:27.96]It doesn't matter.
[192:30.62]Or remove somebody from the deck.
[192:35.26]I think you guys are clicking in the middle.
[192:39.59]No, you're not.
[192:40.52]You're doing recruit.
[192:41.82]I mean, we can do them all.
[192:46.96]Alright, I'll make this easier.
[192:47.90]Let me start from the left.
[192:49.06]Because, I mean, we're going to probably do them all.
[192:52.75]So, forget about this.
[192:53.55]It'll be easier this way.
[193:00.52]Who do you want me to recruit?
[193:03.64]We've got Giant Anaconda, Duskfallen Aviana, like Evil Aviana.
[193:09.99]That's like Dark Pit.
[193:12.09]Kel'thuzad, and then Ragnaros.
[193:13.99]So who would you like me to do that to?
[193:18.12]That's a better question.
[193:18.94]How to beat you?
[193:26.11]And no, I cannot take the innkeeper.
[193:34.78]Seems to be a split between Kel'Thuzad and Ragnaros and the innkeeper because I said the word.
[193:45.84]I said the word innkeeper and everyone's hand just Ouija board over to his face.
[193:58.31]So, it looks like it's gonna be Kel'thuzad.
[194:00.25]Alright.
[194:03.21]Thank you for voting.
[194:08.00]Kel'thuzad is coming with us.
[194:12.72]Alright, now who do you want me to give plus one... plus one... two.
[194:23.99]Well, plus, no, who do you want me to get plus two, plus two, two?
[194:27.41]Who do you want me to give plus two, plus two, two?
[194:33.91]Pharaoh, uh, Gib?
[194:43.05]Astral Tide, Pharaoh, I mean, that's three, three, one drop, that's pretty good.
[194:51.68]That would also be a 5-7 Astral Tiger, which is insane.
[194:56.45]3-3-1 drop, that multiplies.
[195:04.39]Yeah, that's true.
[195:04.91]That's really good.
[195:06.84]Alright.
[195:08.84]Okay.
[195:09.16]Do you want me to remove anyone?
[195:11.08]Do we still want to do that?
[195:22.86]You know, let's, okay, click, you know who, are we removing anybody?
[195:28.74]I don't think so.
[195:30.07]I don't think so.
[195:33.01]I think these, they all have a place here.
[195:35.99]The death rattles, no, we can't, no, I'm not getting rid of any of these.
[195:40.07]I'm not gonna remove me.
[195:43.15]Replace the streamer with a better streamer.
[195:50.72]Nah, we're good.
[195:52.00]These are all deathrattles.
[195:55.02]Why won't it work?
[195:59.89]Let's go.
[196:00.17]Once you say it, Twitch repeats it.
[196:03.47]Whenever a player plays a coin, draw a card.
[196:21.93]I'm gonna forget about that.
[196:23.23]I'm gonna give him so much money.
[196:32.39]I just realized... These kobolds just look like human skin alligators.
[196:52.65]Weird, right?
[196:54.95]Alright, uh, I don't want that.
[196:56.37]We're gonna actually hold on to the quest this time.
[197:00.83]Give me some low cost, please.
[197:06.65]Eh.
[197:11.29]That's okay.
[197:13.47]Alright.
[197:14.53]Whenever a player plays a coin, draw a card.
[197:20.60]So, I'm assuming he's going to give me coins?
[197:23.00]I'm definitely going to do this.
[197:27.49]Yeah, just leave that.
[197:29.15]I think I popped the treasure once.
[197:32.83]Is this guy going to play a card?
[197:33.79]There it is.
[197:49.58]Why would you play that now?
[197:50.50]It's gone.
[197:50.78]Right?
[197:50.90]Why would you do that?
[197:51.56]Shit!
[198:17.73]Uh-oh.
[198:18.37]He's gonna give me two coins!
[198:25.44]Send it back.
[198:26.46]Send it back.
[198:26.96]Send it back.
[198:27.70]Yeah, just- I'll take the coins.
[198:28.82]I don't give a shit.
[198:29.70]Send it back.
[198:34.92]I gotta get two of them.
[198:41.13]Look at all that.
[198:48.93]No, I'm not going to coin.
[198:54.44]He's dead right here.
[198:58.50]No!
[198:58.82]It's alright.
[198:59.86]I'm going to coin out Gruul.
[199:05.58]I'm putting Gruul out right now.
[199:11.57]Or coin out Bone Mare and give the taunt to the Astral Tiger.
[199:23.15]I like that.
[199:24.63]That sounds fun.
[199:26.59]I can still kill Questing Adventure.
[199:31.86]The coins are going to grow Questing.
[199:34.02]Fuck.
[199:41.88]They don't?
[199:51.38]I was listening to one guy.
[199:53.28]I was listening to one guy.
[199:55.68]Let's do this.
[200:00.74]And I can kill questing and be fine.
[200:02.46]Alright, now we're in a good spot.
[200:13.39]Awww.
[200:17.85]I'll take two tigers.
[200:21.48]Overkill?
[200:24.68]Well, there's the big bad Archmage.
[200:31.07]I could do, uh, Scribe.
[200:35.09]Or I could hit and kill.
[200:42.27]Or bring out the Direhorn.
[200:49.81]Yeah, it's Direhorn face.
[201:03.35]And we get a coin.
[201:04.01]Oh, fuck you.
[201:07.25]Okay.
[201:13.37]Uh... I think I gotta bring out Gruul.
[201:16.62]I think I have to.
[201:18.98]Or the Scribe.
[201:27.70]Can kill that with this, but then...
[201:31.88]Yeah, we'll do this.
[201:32.54]I have too many coins!
[201:38.22]I need to get rid of these.
[201:49.14]Wha- What did you just do?
[201:51.44]What did he just do?
[201:52.04]Did he vanish?
[201:52.72]Why did you vanish?!
[201:54.17]This is heroic!
[201:58.28]This is on the road.
[201:59.72]Oh, please.
[202:01.39]Oh, please!
[202:04.15]Oh, please!
[202:06.23]I don't even care!
[202:17.28]And here comes Barnabas!
[202:30.54]I don't even know what's happening!
[202:32.60]Wait, he summons- oh, he summons six cost minions?
[202:37.69]Uh-oh, you had to get rid of Aviana.
[202:48.02]It doesn't matter.
[202:50.90]Reduce the cost of your minions in your deck to zero.
[202:53.72]That's so stupid.
[202:58.47]I mean, like, let's... Okay.
[203:07.11]Did I just win?
[203:07.75]I just win.
[203:10.18]But I want to see that, though.
[203:11.98]That's fun.
[203:13.46]I'll take him down to one health.
[203:14.60]That is dangerous.
[203:19.94]Never mind.
[203:30.53]Yeah, this is heroic.
[203:32.63]I can't, I don't wanna fuck around.
[203:38.84]That was awesome.
[203:40.62]Just like that, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[203:43.28]That's what you live for.
[203:52.84]Roar, beasts and buffs are big friends again.
[204:01.56]Another Direhorn.
[204:04.26]Malorne.
[204:04.86]That's just double.
[204:07.63]Rush.
[204:07.95]Overkill.
[204:08.31]Summon a beast from your hand.
[204:09.39]I don't really have any beasts.
[204:10.37]I mean, I guess maybe.
[204:15.83]Adapt.
[204:16.17]Adapt means that every turn you get to do something else, right?
[204:18.93]Or every... You just change it to, like, Divine Shield.
[204:21.61]Taunt.
[204:22.30]Rush.
[204:23.06]Right.
[204:28.00]I do have a ton of beasts.
[204:28.88]I guess I do.
[204:29.64]Alright.
[204:30.06]Sounds good.
[204:36.48]Banker Biggs.
[204:40.57]Return a friendly minion to your hand then give it plus four plus four and copy it.
[204:45.94]That sounds kind of ridiculous.
[205:00.15]How the hell are you supposed to deal with that?
[205:01.73]Just play it.
[205:02.83]Shit.
[205:03.27]Oh, that's a disgusting, awful start.
[205:28.99]Oh, yuck.
[205:29.92]I lose.
[205:34.78]Job's done.
[205:37.14]People come to me when they want to start really making money.
[205:41.46]I'm calling security.
[205:44.25]What?
[205:44.61]What?
[205:44.91]I didn't... Why would you call security on me?
[205:46.35]I didn't do anything.
[205:46.91]This is bad.
[205:47.39]I need these coins.
[205:54.55]If I have... If I stand any chance.
[205:56.08]You can get it the easy way.
[206:03.71]I don't stand a chance.
[206:04.33]I need the coins right now.
[206:06.80]Die.
[206:08.06]It's invader zoom.
[206:23.45]Alright.
[206:25.15]Two and one.
[206:26.13]No, that's bad.
[206:27.13]That's not gonna work.
[206:28.01]I have to just get the coins.
[206:32.74]Or I could... Hmm... Tiger's not terrible here.
[206:41.67]This is a gamble, but it might be alright.
[207:11.28]Literally, what did that accomplish?
[207:12.72]I don't... Nothing.
[207:15.70]I don't know why, I just... I looked over and I saw somebody say it.
[207:20.13]No, I can't use the coins, no.
[207:21.55]Fuck.
[207:23.23]I have to put something out here.
[207:31.52]It was me.
[207:33.48]What the fuck?
[207:35.56]I forgot that there's people that are writing things specifically so I'll look at it and then they'll go, you might do it.
[207:41.37]I need to focus on me.
[207:47.77]Literally, what did that accomplish?
[207:49.91]You're right.
[207:50.61]Damn it.
[207:51.05]Okay.
[207:55.91]This is... That's the best card in the whole game, right?
[207:59.61]Isn't that the best current card?
[208:01.66]Like, the broken meta card?
[208:05.70]Okay, I have two coins.
[208:09.68]Seven.
[208:10.24]I could do four.
[208:11.74]And then twin spell them.
[208:14.70]No.
[208:15.36]I could do tiger.
[208:16.10]Come on.
[208:28.86]Was I gonna, like, draw that next?
[208:30.52]Why do I keep pulling this?
[208:39.70]I have to, like, coin and hit this.
[208:45.66]Right?
[208:46.12]I mean, like, this is horrible.
[208:57.39]No?
[208:59.28]I mean, it takes the shield off, so I don't get guaranteed.
[209:02.48]I would do that.
[209:07.10]That's what I would do.
[209:08.78]That's what you would do.
[209:09.37]I think that's what I would do as well.
[209:16.01]Go face?
[209:16.79]I can't.
[209:17.73]Oh, this is so bad.
[209:18.63]Uh-oh.
[209:20.56]Uh-oh.
[209:26.92]Anonymous five community subs, thank you.
[209:30.28]There were an insane amount of community subs tonight.
[209:34.20]And somebody else just gave five more.
[209:38.69]Thank you so much for the subs.
[209:43.43]What the hell am I gonna do about this?
[209:46.88]Chromaggus?
[209:54.71]Chromaggus is probably the best thing that I can do.
[210:05.11]Or I could do... I could wait, but I'm gonna take so much damage.
[210:09.81]Next turn, bring this out, kill somebody, and summon Chromaggus.
[210:12.79]Fuck.
[210:15.49]I'm just gonna have to pop the shield.
[210:20.03]Pop shield.
[210:22.72]Kill you.
[210:24.74]Bring out the tiger.
[210:31.77]Should I maybe just... no.
[210:37.71]That's the dream right there, if I can get it.
[210:44.41]I need to draw that.
[210:46.11]Right now.
[210:47.31]That clears up everything.
[210:49.53]I'm fast and furious!
[210:56.23]Draw it.
[210:56.57]Come on.
[210:57.53]Topdeck that cra- Topdeck the Elder right now.
[211:00.93]Topdeck Elder right now and I still have a chance.
[211:06.95]Does that change things?
[211:07.95]That might... Ugh.
[211:11.10]Coin Bone Mare?
[211:14.66]Or Coin Coin Rush into like you.
[211:21.06]Pull out... What would Master Rat do?
[211:30.31]I'll get Chromaggus or Ironhide.
[211:31.97]Who do I kill with this?
[212:00.02]The 2-4 or the 4-3?
[212:03.10]Well, just go face.
[212:04.30]You can't go face with a rush.
[212:20.58]Alright, I got a chance.
[212:21.76]Next turn, I do... This is alright.
[212:34.69]Now we pull out Bone Mirror.
[212:36.61]And we go face.
[212:38.79]Oh shit, that thing's gonna have 4-4.
[212:40.11]That's just gonna be horrible.
[212:41.21]I gotta... I have to start doing something now.
[212:50.38]I mean, uh... I gotta just go for the win.
[212:56.50]And then I can do... I can do this.
[212:58.62]Oh, no!
[213:03.36]Oh, that's not good.
[213:04.98]This is not good.
[213:05.84]What can I get from this?
[213:12.78]Alright.
[213:13.10]12, 13...
[213:20.56]I can get a shitload of armor.
[213:22.00]11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[213:28.99]Is it lethal?
[214:03.31]Three, six... I have to put Chromaggus out now because I fucking didn't do it right.
[214:11.45]That's three, six, nine, twin spell.
[214:24.76]I have to clear somebody!
[214:30.37]No, I can do it.
[214:31.69]I can do it.
[214:32.19]6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[214:39.19]Don't!
[214:40.31]No!
[214:41.59]Hold on!
[214:42.63]Hold on!
[214:47.31]Alright, now draw.
[214:48.39]I can- can I do it?
[214:53.91]Oh, you motherfucker!
[214:55.51]If only he was the elder.
[214:57.17]Hold on. 6?
[215:00.58]Seven, eight, nine.
[215:04.66]Nine.
[215:05.10]No, it's not enough.
[215:16.84]Go for the roll.
[215:17.68]Beetleberries, my favorite.
[215:32.38]Oh no, I had a chance.
[215:34.50]You know what?
[215:35.60]Fuck the RNG I got in the beginning.
[215:37.66]I pulled the Elder twice.
[215:45.88]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[215:56.58]Do I get... Hold on, do I live?
[215:58.68]Do I live one more turn?
[216:01.96]6, 12, 18... Fuck you, game.
[216:09.92]Oh, there he is.
[216:11.28]Wait, what?
[216:13.93]I need him to die.
[216:18.21]Maybe he'll be an idiot.
[216:19.03]Maybe he won't kill me.
[216:41.57]Damn it.
[216:42.25]It was this thing that screwed me.
[216:43.67]That's why I had to get rid of him.
[216:44.77]Oh well.
[216:47.55]Damn it.
[216:47.89]Oh, I have to beat it.
[216:48.53]I have to do it.
[217:07.36]Oh wait, what's the tavern roll?
[217:19.06]Nefarian Rises?
[217:21.72]Oh no.
[217:29.03]Okay.
[217:36.96]Alright, let's do Anomaly.
[217:39.80]Where is it?
[217:43.06]Which one of these is it?
[217:45.34]Is it this one?
[217:47.98]Which one of these is Anomaly?
[217:51.77]Oh, it's above Go.
[217:55.13]Anomaly mode.
[217:55.87]Gain a random effect for this run.
[217:58.69]Minions gain plus one, plus one at the end of their owner's turn.
[218:04.66]So, what is this?
[218:05.36]Random every time?
[218:09.11]That makes it easy, right?
[218:10.31]I don't want to do that.
[218:20.96]It's random every run.
[218:22.72]Anomalies are lazier.
[218:27.22]It works for them.
[218:28.32]All minions get it.
[218:29.76]Oh, shit.
[218:30.40]Okay.
[218:36.35]Let's try...
[218:39.57]Let's try that.
[218:40.05]Let's do heroic on here.
[218:41.27]Let's pick a new class.
[219:08.35]Mage.
[219:10.91]Sounds good to me.
[219:14.49]Gonna be Fireman.
[219:16.95]Okay.
[219:19.83]Easy enough, thank you.
[219:28.90]Fire Blast.
[219:30.96]Can only do Apprentice.
[219:34.41]What's my favorite class?
[219:35.70]It was Paladin when I played years ago.
[219:38.56]Alright, Alchemist Wendy.
[219:44.64]We did this already.
[219:52.23]The deck that I used to play when I attempted was the Silver Hand deck.
[220:03.56]Where you had that guy that gave everybody 3-3, and it was pretty fun.
[220:09.56]Alright, this is different stuff.
[220:16.11]Sickening.
[220:18.29]Yeah, it was aggro pally, right?
[220:23.56]So this one, who's in there?
[220:27.02]Your murlocs cost 1.
[220:29.08]Well.
[220:31.46]Draw 2 cards.
[220:33.80]Destroy it.
[220:37.71]This one.
[220:44.05]Was that the deck that was so easy that bots could get a high rank with it?
[220:47.81]I don't know.
[220:54.80]It was.
[220:57.73]Whatever.
[221:01.15]Deal two damage, add a 1-1 elemental.
[221:03.67]I'm gonna say we just get the... We could just kill it.
[221:08.37]Or bring out the fairy dragon.
[221:11.37]I would put out the fairy dragon right here.
[221:16.78]Or I would do that and skip.
[221:20.46]No, a secret paladin.
[221:21.72]Yeah.
[221:22.46]That wasn't that one.
[221:36.55]Chaos chaos.
[221:37.59]Why are you saying chaos?
[221:39.21]Oh Because it jevel one more turn and I get scar gill I
[221:57.39]Well, I can do... Eh?
[222:05.15]Eh?
[222:09.83]I can just kill him and hit him in the face.
[222:12.19]Or you can just sell the cigarette and... I can whack him, you know?
[222:24.90]Thanks for the dubs, thanks for the doubles Stupid Now that gets me this for free
[222:55.72]Free two damage, but does that really do much for me?
[223:01.22]I got my dubs!
[223:02.84]Doubles!
[223:08.84]That didn't really do much for me, though.
[223:19.37]I mean, like, fucking die.
[223:20.73]Who cares?
[223:25.54]Checked.
[223:27.55]Check him.
[223:28.03]What does checked mean?
[223:30.01]Like checkmate?
[223:32.25]Yeah.
[223:33.63]Checkmate, motherfucker.
[223:34.67]Oh, that sucked.
[223:39.13]Am I gonna lose?
[223:48.10]No, earthen ring.
[224:06.60]What's that?
[224:07.16]Whenever your spells deal damage, restore that much health to your hero.
[224:11.91]Aggressive.
[224:13.51]Battle detected.
[224:16.69]Low on fuel.
[224:21.82]Okay, well.
[224:25.68]We're going to polymorph you.
[224:26.88]Then we're going to kill you.
[224:31.45]Just like this, I'll show you.
[224:32.65]It's going to be so easy.
[224:36.41]What am I doing?
[224:37.35]Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[224:39.39]Snip, snip.
[224:43.75]Snip, snip.
[225:01.04]I can do it too!
[225:02.50]See?
[225:02.80]I'm gonna lose.
[225:09.24]No, I'm not.
[225:15.71]It's Calcigos!
[225:17.79]Your first spell each turn costs zero.
[225:19.39]Uh, I want this.
[225:24.91]It's impossible to lose at this point?
[225:27.83]Let me tell you something.
[225:33.28]It's possible.
[225:42.48]It's possible.
[225:43.44]It's very possible now.
[225:46.27]Well, actually not anymore.
[225:51.15]Yeah, it's not possible anymore.
[226:05.20]You can't hurt me, I'm immune!
[226:11.02]Wait, I want him to die, watch this.
[226:13.02]Level up!
[226:23.85]And I got a golden mirror image, cool.
[226:32.25]Some good ones here.
[226:41.11]Play Classic WoW?
[226:41.89]I don't have access to it.
[226:44.03]I told you guys that eventually when I got access to it, I was gonna try to just beat Molten Core with chat.
[226:54.28]But I mean, that would take months.
[226:57.66]Where are you guys clicking?
[227:03.55]Minions that cost 5 or more cost 5.
[227:05.41]You can use your Hero Power twice each turn.
[227:07.01]It costs 1.
[227:08.27]Death Rattles.
[227:09.53]So all the minions that are 5 or more just cost 5.
[227:12.35]Dude, you're never even going to get to level 60.
[227:19.60]Who are you kidding?
[227:24.80]Alright.
[227:25.51]We need big minions now.
[227:33.31]babbling book we got what do we got for minions?
[227:37.17]calcigos where do you want me to go here?
[227:53.04]can I ask?
[227:56.48]24% of everybody that's clicking the screen where do you want me to go?
[228:05.36]Quit the game?
[228:14.64]No, this is what we're doing.
[228:17.37]Cooking simulator tomorrow.
[228:19.27]Because it actually releases.
[228:20.41]No, I'm not going to start Heroes of Might and Magic 3 now.
[228:28.77]No, this is a Hearthstone comfortable stream.
[228:32.71]Didn't I just... Dude, why am I doing these twice in a row?
[228:39.86]Play Constructed?
[228:40.68]I can't do that.
[228:48.89]After Arena, it was an absolute disaster.
[228:52.67]I will try Arena one more time.
[228:54.93]I'm getting deja vu, but I don't mind this start.
[229:02.34]Okay.
[229:13.48]Should I start doing Bane?
[229:15.80]To get chat under control?
[229:19.59]Do viewer games?
[229:24.07]Can you do viewer games?
[229:27.11]Wouldn't I have to add a bunch of people on Battle.net?
[229:29.70]I don't think you can do that, can you?
[229:36.10]I'd have to add everybody on Battle.net.
[229:44.47]Alright, what do I want to do?
[229:46.47]I want to, after you cast a spell, deal one damage to a random enemy minion.
[229:50.32]That sounds pretty good.
[229:57.31]Make a guild in Classic WoW?
[229:58.69]I was thinking about it.
[230:00.43]That sounds effective.
[230:09.92]What do I think about Magic Gathering?
[230:11.26]It's too complicated for me.
[230:13.60]Just too much for me.
[230:14.86]I can barely handle Hearthstone.
[230:18.32]Alright, so here we go.
[230:18.96]Ready?
[230:19.28]I'm going for it.
[230:23.98]Yep.
[230:25.99]It worked.
[230:38.95]Too complicated.
[230:39.81]Yeah, it just kind of is.
[230:53.16]See, a game like Hearthstone, I can, I mean, obviously just dick around and play it, like, once in a while.
[230:57.16]But... You kind of need to know what you're doing in Magic the Gathering.
[231:05.61]You need to know a lot, don't you?
[231:09.64]Should I bring out... Let's just get a magic trick.
[231:19.43]I mean, just do that now?
[231:20.87]Maybe I'll get another free one.
[231:22.41]You have to learn the basics, but Magic Gathering Arena is autopilot.
[231:37.60]Just autopilot.
[231:38.90]Hmm.
[231:45.67]You're not going to attack me, huh?
[231:50.12]Well, there's Calcigos.
[231:54.14]I can... Alright, here we go.
[231:54.96]Watch this.
[231:55.58]Your first spell each turn causes zero.
[232:04.52]Three damage, freeze a character.
[232:05.82]If I were to freeze a minion, if it's already frozen, destroy it.
[232:07.99]This one.
[232:09.13]And then we're going to sheep you.
[232:13.73]And face...
[232:20.05]Thanks for the free spells, Calcigos.
[232:32.23]Yeah, for the most part, the last couple of streams have really just been... I needed low-key stuff, and I mean, we've been dicking around and I've been making fucking loud noises, but I really was supposed to take it easy.
[232:48.12]So, tomorrow we're going to be doing Cooking Simulator.
[232:52.59]So don't worry.
[232:54.17]Don't worry.
[232:55.97]I think I win.
[232:57.95]Four, five, six, seven, eight.
[233:03.42]Nine, ten.
[233:04.14]I could get good RNG here.
[233:06.00]Here we go.
[233:07.23]I'm just going to... Who cares?
[233:14.64]Is that it?
[233:15.94]Four, five, six, seven, eight, argh!
[233:18.00]Am I gonna play Dreams again?
[233:34.24]Yeah, I'll probably play Dreams... ...once I hook up the PS4 again.
[233:42.96]Because at that point... Once we have something else to do on PS4, because by this point, I think there's a lot more stuff in Dreams.
[233:54.81]So, yeah.
[233:56.93]I think so.
[234:07.17]Yeah, we've played it a few times already.
[234:09.31]It's really, really fun.
[234:12.76]It's really interesting.
[234:13.42]It's fun just to channel surf.
[234:21.27]Well, yeah.
[234:21.73]We kind of have to go big.
[234:22.89]Because these will all be five cost.
[234:28.57]Go big.
[234:29.53]100% click.
[234:31.15]Look at that.
[234:36.60]Oh, I also have to check on my...
[234:41.50]I'm gonna check on the, um, what is it though?
[234:45.52]Didn't I release the worm to the public?
[234:47.66]I wonder if anybody did anything with it.
[234:50.18]All healing is doubled.
[234:54.27]What?
[234:56.61]What's wrong?
[235:01.79]Hey.
[235:03.65]What's wrong?
[235:04.01]What's going on here?
[235:06.93]You alright?
[235:11.44]That was weird.
[235:11.76]They having server trouble?
[235:20.51]The Wyrm.
[235:21.11]Ban for BM?
[235:21.49]Who, me?
[235:22.07]Who you referring to?
[235:43.94]Chad has saved 3,095 secrets.
[235:45.28]I was supposed to delete that at 1,000.
[235:46.70]I need a new number now.
[235:53.69]Do I have any elementals?
[236:02.96]I don't think there's any elementals even in the whole deck.
[236:05.58]I guess the Flame Geyser will make one?
[236:07.66]Or two?
[236:18.72]Double healing.
[236:26.16]Not gonna play a card.
[236:26.88]Alright, I'll just take it.
[236:27.82]Fine.
[236:32.76]Alright, let me summon an elemental.
[236:36.00]That's an elemental, isn't it?
[236:39.78]This is an elemental, right?
[236:42.70]It's not.
[236:44.51]Oh, shit.
[236:50.44]This is an elemental.
[236:51.32]Arcane Anomaly.
[236:52.02]Should I just get it out there?
[236:58.29]Read the card.
[236:58.85]Well, I know.
[236:59.35]I just saw the fucking goo.
[237:16.13]Eight health to all minions.
[237:17.47]Alright.
[237:21.58]I'm gonna have a pretty big hand for this.
[237:25.42]I'm just gonna go face.
[237:27.40]And then next turn have like a huge minion.
[237:30.60]Because that will be...
[237:43.65]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[237:45.43]It'll be a seven cost minion.
[237:55.65]Do I get this?
[237:56.33]Not yet.
[237:56.65]Next turn.
[237:56.97]What is it?
[237:57.23]It's a taunt.
[237:59.56]All right, here we go.
[238:00.78]Seven cost minion incoming.
[238:03.38]Oh, damn it.
[238:11.74]Oh, they're gonna kill it right now too.
[238:13.78]Shit.
[238:14.24]Oh well.
[238:29.31]What does he get from this?
[238:37.11]I know, you're gonna kill it.
[238:38.23]Yeah, I don't even get to see the fun thing.
[238:41.74]But I get a taunt now.
[238:42.94]And we can do it again.
[238:46.92]Give me something else.
[238:50.28]Alright.
[238:54.26]Um... Maybe I don't even do anything.
[239:10.71]What is the rewards thing?
[239:12.89]Freudian Weapon.
[239:13.95]Cheers.
[239:14.49]Shared rewards to three others in chat.
[239:16.56]What happened?
[239:21.58]What does that actually do?
[239:33.85]Share rewards.
[239:35.41]I have no idea.
[239:36.85]Oh.
[239:45.77]He's gonna... he's gonna Inspire.
[239:48.03]Look at two of these things, man.
[239:52.81]Really.
[239:56.59]Well, now we Firelands.
[239:58.41]Yeah, I'd kill somebody.
[240:22.12]Six?
[240:22.48]Fucking no.
[240:25.27]What even is this game?
[240:29.43]Alright, got a taunt restore.
[240:37.61]Eight health to your hero.
[240:38.80]That's pretty good.
[240:39.58]We can just take one damage at a time.
[240:41.32]I can cast a spell.
[240:44.32]We get one damage to a random enemy.
[240:48.54]Um... We're just gonna go with the face.
[240:54.41]Whenever this attacks and kills a minion, summon two Murlocs for me.
[240:56.96]I don't have any Murlocs in my deck.
[240:58.22]Let me just do this.
[241:11.08]I don't want that here.
[241:11.82]Murlocs?
[241:13.04]No, I don't have any.
[241:20.12]What's my voice?
[241:20.72]Am I eating something?
[241:21.54]No, it's just going like this.
[241:24.62]Oh.
[241:33.51]Fuck.
[241:41.16]Um...
[241:50.27]You know, you don't have two of those you're not gonna do that again Good good.
[242:03.19]Okay, we're good
[242:17.03]Deal two damage, add, and one, two, uh-huh.
[242:25.57]Then you, whenever a friendly minion is healed, summon a 3-3 whelp.
[242:30.91]I don't think so.
[242:32.39]Sorry.
[242:39.43]Did I miss lethal?
[242:42.33]Oh, goddammit, he's gonna do this fucking four times.
[243:00.40]Remember I was talking about this last night?
[243:02.22]I mean, that's an elemental, but who cares?
[243:21.05]I have to kind of... What do I do?
[243:22.61]I might just go face.
[243:26.93]I kind of have to, right?
[243:27.89]No, but he's going to heal everything.
[243:34.42]oh my god
[244:05.62]I mean, uh... 3... 8, 7, 6... 5... You mean 4?
[244:13.07]What do you mean?
[244:18.60]What did I do?
[244:21.78]What was it?
[244:22.42]What was the other one?
[244:26.50]Didn't get shatter?
[244:28.62]Oh, that's right.
[244:29.24]This thing freezes people.
[244:30.42]Oh, fuck.
[244:31.72]I forgot.
[244:32.20]It should be called Ice Water Elemental.
[244:35.05]I forgot.
[244:35.67]I haven't seen this card in four years.
[244:38.57]Aye yai.
[244:39.57]I'm going to lose this anyways.
[244:48.66]Maximum chaos.
[244:50.89]I think I'm just screwed.
[244:53.71]What am I going to do about this?
[244:54.93]Let's see.
[244:55.45]Oh, my chest!
[245:20.64]Hey, how about this one?
[245:22.70]Uh, whatever.
[245:25.74]The fate of the world hangs in the balance.
[246:05.78]Didn't get very far on that one
[246:32.20]Do arena?
[246:34.14]I don't have any coins for arena.
[246:37.22]I have to buy arena.
[246:39.96]I'm not doing that.
[246:49.84]I got, I got, you want me to spend $1.99 to go into the arena?
[247:00.49]Do it.
[247:01.71]Don't buy Arena.
[247:03.47]You never buy Arena.
[247:05.73]You really don't ever purchase Arena.
[247:09.53]Purchasing Arena is what a grandmother would do.
[247:12.71]Like an addicted grandmother would be buying Arena over and over again.
[247:16.79]And losing 0 and 3.
[247:18.17]Oh, that was really fun.
[247:19.39]They're going to do that again.
[247:23.05]No, I just have to do some quests.
[247:24.61]Hunter.
[247:26.54]Pirates and weapons.
[247:27.82]I'm going to play Hunter.
[247:31.32]And we can play weapons.
[247:37.74]So play 20 hunter cards and use 6 weapons.
[247:40.95]There's a such thing as Pirate Hunter.
[248:03.00]Pirate.
[248:07.10]Draw two card, overkill, taunt.
[248:31.52]Okay.
[248:35.24]Now we need... Hunter, just Hunter cards.
[248:47.02]Okay, let's do, um...
[249:12.37]I'm sure I didn't rank.
[249:23.19]Rank 25!
[249:23.95]Let's go!
[249:24.39]I'll show you.
[249:26.65]Oh, this person has a cool portrait.
[249:28.77]That means that they're good.
[249:29.57]Alright, I need to play pirates.
[249:39.74]And hunter cards.
[249:45.48]And weapons.
[249:45.96]This is only to get to Arena.
[249:54.13]So I can embarrass myself again.
[250:02.23]Thank you!
[250:02.77]I can get the pirates out even faster.
[250:14.35]Okay.
[250:16.19]Uh, has Charger even weapon equipped?
[250:18.25]Um, well, let's just play it smart.
[250:20.05]Let's get the weapon on, and then let's put these guys out next turn.
[250:22.93]No, I'm not gonna... Idiot.
[250:36.77]Okay.
[250:38.50]I mean, like...
[250:51.87]Let's go.
[250:56.94]Got six mana.
[250:58.30]Let's see what you're gonna put down.
[251:00.76]It's dead.
[251:09.77]Three damage?
[251:18.49]You're playing against a baby.
[251:19.62]This is a kid's game.
[251:20.66]No, it's not a kid's game.
[251:21.74]This is a family game.
[251:37.82]Attack with weapon?
[251:38.66]No, not yet.
[251:39.46]If he puts something down, I need to be able to kill it.
[251:44.03]See?
[251:45.51]That needs to be... I need to be able to kill that.
[251:52.73]Oh, look at that!
[251:55.51]No, I don't need to use that.
[251:59.13]Oh, maybe I should.
[252:20.59]Don't taunt Deathbrow.
[252:22.67]Why do you keep saying that?
[252:25.25]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[252:25.41]Come get me.
[253:00.87]Come on.
[253:02.71]You wanna see what that secret is, don't you?

[253:31.37]Oh yeah?
[253:33.71]How's that sound?
[253:43.74]Rank 25.
[253:49.34]God damn it!
[253:50.52]I can't, like, just get rid of these.
[253:59.37]Somebody just came in and wrote, pirate hunter with a question mark.
[254:05.79]It's fucking, that's so funny.
[254:10.70]Oh, this is it.
[254:15.18]Five, six, seven, eight.
[254:18.58]This is it.
[254:21.42]I'm gonna win.
[254:37.86]Oh, yeah, I know.
[254:41.16]Don't heal to full health.
[254:44.10]We're gonna be rich.
[254:45.81]No.
[254:46.77]It's alright.
[254:51.07]Five out of five?
[254:51.77]Oh, you have to restore five health!
[254:53.51]What?

[255:54.14]If I release the hounds... Oh shit!
[255:59.98]If I release the hounds, then I can...
[256:19.04]Wow, that shouldn't be Trey, but I need to Trey because now he doesn't have any minions.
[256:23.32]Why do you have so many of these?
[256:29.31]I swear to God, I've seen this seven times.
[256:36.27]Freezing Trap, but what?
[256:41.80]I'm the top Hearthstone streamer on Twitch right now.
[256:44.30]Oh, no.
[256:45.60]No.
[256:46.66]Um... No!
[257:00.25]Four, three, six, seven.

[260:23.86]Oh, no, don't do that.
[260:24.62]That... I could, like... I was gonna just kill command of his face.
[260:28.98]It has rank 25?
[260:41.84]Hold on, it says it has rank 25 next to his name on the stream link.
[260:47.79]What do you mean the stream link?
[261:12.81]That's fucking ridiculous.
[261:16.57]Why would it say my rank?
[261:18.01]I don't want it to say what rank I am.
[261:22.02]What did he just do?
[261:22.76]I'm just gonna put on Freezing Trap.
[261:44.90]This is the... Jesus.
[261:59.29]Everyone on Twitch knows now.
[262:01.69]Yeah.
[262:02.93]People are gonna scroll by and they're gonna know.
[262:05.73]Everyone knows now.
[262:06.55]I can't hide it.
[262:15.47]I can't get over that.
[262:17.37]And the tags.
[262:18.65]It knows.
[262:27.09]Rank 25 is the best rank yet.
[262:28.65]Rank 25 is the highest rank you can be.
[262:33.33]It's- you can't get higher than 25.
[262:35.37]You can go- What happened?
[262:49.58]I'm confused.
[262:50.48]Hold on.
[262:59.56]Can I get something besides spells?
[263:04.79]No, you can't be... This is the highest rank you can be.
[263:08.57]Sure, you can go lower.
[263:10.53]You can drop lower in rank.
[263:13.13]But I'm the highest rank in Hearthstone.
[263:27.32]Why do I have all these fucking spells?
[263:36.03]I- Just get- I don't want them anymore!
[263:37.75]Just get them out!
[263:47.30]Because you auto-completed your deck.
[263:50.10]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[263:51.64]We were just doing this to get to Arena.
[264:01.14]Whenever this minion takes... What is it?
[264:04.51]Summon a 2-3 mech with Taunt.
[264:05.99]He's waiting for that one.
[264:27.80]This is the kind of shit you can experience on the number one Hearthstone stream on Twitch.
[264:34.88]Number one!
[264:35.54]Rank 25 plays.
[264:56.96]This guy's pretending to be a noob and he's going to pull out an OTK combo?
[265:02.17]Like, dead in one turn?
[265:04.99]I will laugh my fucking ass off if I lose in one turn.
[265:10.17]If I get one turn super comboed, one turn killed, I will cry laughing.
[265:16.21]Someone call the defense.
[265:24.69]No, there's nothing wrong with this.
[265:26.25]You know, the game is free, and anybody can just get it and play it.
[265:29.41]And you've got to start somewhere.
[265:58.38]Yeah, but you didn't just start, you've been... Yeah, I have probably... I'm not gonna lie, I'll be honest with you.
[266:04.95]I absolutely have like 400 hours in this game.
[266:09.47]I mean, maybe like 200 hours of those are opening packs.
[266:13.28]But this is like back in 2013.
[266:14.10]Oh yeah, what a trade.
[266:18.16]What?
[266:32.08]What's happening?
[266:32.80]Oh the- Get out!
[266:44.13]Leave!
[266:44.43]Don't come to this stream!
[266:45.87]This stream is not one you want to watch.
[266:48.49]The viewers have gone up by like 240.
[266:49.73]You don't want to be here.
[266:56.68]There's a stream, like, right there!
[267:08.59]That you should probably watch instead.
[267:10.79]It's, like, over there.
[267:11.61]Am I having fun?
[267:16.60]Yeah!
[267:20.30]He just got this cape from Father's Day.
[267:21.94]Yeah, my son told me to try this out.
[267:23.88]It's called Hearthstone.
[267:28.05]What do you got here?
[267:30.27]Shuffle a bomb into your opponent's deck.
[267:34.84]Well, I need a fucking minion.
[267:48.41]Anybody die this turn?
[267:56.58]Can we get a professional hand cam?
[268:01.53]No.
[268:06.25]A fucking hand cam?
[268:10.57]Oh my god.
[268:22.10]We need to see the inputs.
[268:27.49]Oh my god, did I actually just get echoed here?
[268:30.89]Deal 3 damage overkill, summon a 5-5 Devilsaur.
[268:34.19]That's all I need.
[268:37.39]What is this?
[268:44.62]Here comes a bomb.
[268:51.00]Put on a professional foot cam.
[269:00.77]I'm not playing, like, the drums.
[269:13.53]I think I just won.
[269:15.09]No, god damn it.
[269:20.15]Overkill.
[269:21.25]Oh, come on.
[269:25.43]That's not it.
[269:25.85]3... 4, 5...
[269:39.97]I need to kill something.
[269:44.29]I didn't lose yet.
[269:45.06]Not yet.
[269:52.44]We lost.
[269:52.96]No, not yet.
[269:53.58]It's not over.
[270:01.44]Oh god, here it comes.
[270:08.66]No, I just need to get a damage card and I can do it.
[270:23.41]What now?
[270:37.48]I think it's still possible.
[270:45.14]No, it's not.
[270:58.51]Oops, I didn't mean to do that!
[271:01.16]There's a couple of chicken league plays, not a big deal.
[271:16.40]I'm dead, he just has to click on me.
[271:29.14]I'm getting BM'd, aren't I?
[271:44.06]This is great.
[271:45.70]Concede before he kills you.
[271:47.38]No.
[271:48.30]I'm gonna concede right when he's about to hit me.
[272:09.86]50 gold!
[272:10.20]50 gold!
[272:10.90]50 gold!
[272:11.54]Let's go to arena, boys and girls.
[272:28.20]Where we going?
[272:28.62]Who?
[272:35.07]You want me to be Uther the Lightbringer?
[272:45.77]Uther it is.
[272:51.11]All right, we got the last arena deck.
[272:53.07]You can call me terrible all you want, right?
[272:54.79]Like, obviously, I was playing pirate fucking hunter.
[272:57.49]But this is important.
[272:58.97]The last arena deck was not very good.
[273:02.31]It was very bad.
[273:05.54]It was maybe like a one and a half out of ten.
[273:08.56]So, I mean, you've seen me play heroic single player.
[273:14.38]I did all right.
[273:15.24]I went through a couple runs of the normal one.
[273:17.76]You've seen me play.
[273:20.95]With the right cards, I think we can accomplish something here.
[273:23.91]Come on.
[273:24.83]Give me some good ones.
[273:30.31]Flame Juggler.
[273:38.06]You died on Heroic.
[273:39.26]Yeah, but I got to, like, the eighth boss, or seventh boss.
[273:43.17]Splog just gave five community subs.
[273:49.69]Thank you, Splar.
[273:50.79]All right.
[273:55.47]Can I get banned for people playing on... Well, picking cards, I don't think is... It's not like people can control the game.
[274:12.40]What are you doing?
[274:15.58]Why are there so many people clicking on this?
[274:26.49]What?
[274:33.11]62%?
[274:33.13]That's such a monster amount of people.
[274:36.23]What's wrong?
[274:44.31]What is wrong?
[274:48.37]70% of every person just clicked.
[274:49.98]There has to be something going on.
[274:55.87]What is it?
[275:05.44]I'm not buying cards.
[275:11.60]When two-thirds of every person clicks on back, I think that there's something wrong.
[275:19.99]I'm not buying card packs!
[275:30.17]Choose one of these.
[275:31.71]I'm already opening card packs.
[275:36.29]Every time you click on one of these, you get to see another pack of three, and you pick one.
[275:48.06]All right, so the only card you want me to pick is this one.
[275:51.64]It sounds like a fucking plan, guys.
[275:58.47]What are you doing?
[276:02.09]I'm not actually going to click on Lowly Squire.
[276:06.54]I'm not actually clicking on this.
[276:13.64]Really?
[276:13.98]This deck already has got trouble written all over it.
[276:36.13]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[276:37.31]This can be influenced here.
[276:38.57]Hold on.
[276:39.95]Try it again.
[276:46.53]That's better.
[276:50.13]He's being disobedient.
[276:52.72]Come on, I'm not... I'm not clicking on the shop.
[277:03.38]Scribe is the best one.
[277:04.34]It's not even close.
[277:07.01]I wish I could click on it, but... I have to work with what I'm given.
[277:28.37]Just for anyone that's curious, this is the worst card in Hearthstone.
[277:37.05]I would veto if you even picked this.
[277:45.87]I would just pretend this one's not here.
[277:50.39]People are voting for Manor Wraith.
[277:58.44]I feel like the people that are clicking on Manta Wraith, and the people that are clicking on Manta Wraith, especially not Manta Wraith, especially the one in the middle there, I think they were just doing it to make, like, a laugh.
[278:11.45]You know what I mean?
[278:15.87]You can't believe I paid for Arena?
[278:17.11]How am I going to get there?
[278:22.09]Alright, these are... This Amoeba is starting to get together.
[278:24.87]Alright, so Lil' Exorcist, Taunt, Battlecry, that's pretty good.
[278:36.32]We have too many of these.
[278:41.55]This is the best card in Arena.
[278:48.31]I know everyone's clicking on this.
[278:51.56]Oops!
[278:53.76]Everyone was clicking on it.
[278:54.62]I know you were.
[278:55.84]Everybody clicked it.
[278:58.52]By the way, guys, can we get a... Excuse me.
[279:01.40]If you're going to click, please click in the middle of the cards, not like here or here.
[279:07.27]You're making a big balloon.
[279:09.25]Okay, now that we've had the discussion, go for it.
[279:31.17]93... What?
[279:41.60]Oh, I guess I'm... Okay.
[279:49.76]That was a... Alright.
[279:55.23]Go for it.
[280:09.39]I guess I'm just gonna pick this one.
[280:11.01]So... I'm gonna say it's gonna be... How about... I think it's gonna be... I need some 1-drops.
[280:22.68]It's gonna be Glowtron.
[280:32.18]Wrong choice.
[280:35.00]I'm sorry, but I'm going by what I see on the screen.
[280:47.21]Always Yeti.
[280:52.81]Oh my fucking god.
[280:54.09]I'm just gonna pick the cards.
[280:55.75]I'm just gonna fucking pick them.
[280:57.55]I'm just gonna pick them.
[281:06.61]He's literally crying.
[281:09.45]You're doing this because you want me to open packs.
[281:12.11]Is that what you really are saying right now?
[281:23.56]Try it again.
[281:33.47]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[281:34.75]I was trying to... It doesn't matter.
[281:36.42]I see you.
[281:37.62]I see you guys right here.
[281:38.68]I was going to pick the Yeti anyways.
[281:45.50]Yeah, I got you.
[281:49.70]You want Spellbreaker?
[281:54.61]It's splitting up a little bit here.
[281:57.19]Spellbreaker it is.
[282:11.66]Always antique healbot.
[282:12.70]You have to zoom in more.
[282:29.77]Hold on.
[282:45.91]Why are you clicking up here?
[282:46.97]What are you guys doing?
[282:49.49]Have I lost all faith in this right now?
[283:16.12]Weaponized Pinata?
[283:20.96]I'm gonna go 0 and 3 again because of this.
[283:24.56]I'm about to step in here.
[283:34.65]Choose a card equals Jerma's Choice.
[283:37.19]Oh, nice.
[283:37.59]That's a good idea.
[283:39.15]Not like it matters.
[283:39.83]12 of these cards have been awful.
[283:43.55]You're gonna go 0 and 3 because you're bad.
[283:44.95]Now I'm gonna go 0 and 3 because I just picked weaponized pinata.
[284:02.89]Lights justice.
[284:09.72]Now I know you guys are just fucking with me.
[284:26.32]What a joke.
[284:26.90]This is worse than the last one.
[284:29.42]This deck actually might be worse than the first one.
[284:43.03]Alright, we don't have very much... We got like 13 more to do.
[284:52.38]This is a tough one.
[284:53.46]Actually, all these are good.
[284:59.32]People are just clicking the golden card.
[285:10.00]Three, two, one, go.
[285:14.73]You gave us this power?
[285:15.51]Yeah, and I'm gonna try to at least win one game.
[285:20.35]If I can go like two and two, or two and three, I'll be happy.
[285:28.33]Deal 3 damage to all minions.
[285:30.09]Jesus.
[285:32.07]This is close.
[285:41.33]Say the name out loud of whichever card you want them to click.
[285:44.74]It's not that hard.
[285:48.26]I think you underestimate this community.
[285:51.40]Okay.
[285:56.40]I'll show you.
[286:01.79]Please everybody click on muster for battle.
[286:10.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[286:11.00]Click on any other card, any other card.
[286:13.40]I don't want that.
[286:23.64]I want minibot or, hey, please click on shielded minibot.
[286:36.69]See?
[286:37.45]Only 9%.
[286:37.69]Hold on.
[286:38.05]Let me do this again.
[286:41.01]Everyone click on True Silver Champion.
[286:45.03]If True Silver Champion does not have at least 40% of the vote, the stream is turning off.
[287:09.52]See, look at this.
[287:12.78]Look at these anarchists over here.
[287:17.65]15% just want this to turn off.
[287:18.89]38% are just like, is he bluffing?
[287:22.56]We got 47% good boys and good girls.
[287:43.38]Hurry up.
[287:44.22]This is part of the experience.
[287:52.35]Bomb Lobber or Argent Protector.
[287:57.45]Mmm.
[287:59.91]This is very mid-heavy.
[288:02.45]This experience is boring.
[288:03.91]Hey.
[288:06.49]What?
[288:12.41]It's boring.
[288:13.05]It is.
[288:18.93]Well, it won't be long now until it's over.
[288:23.22]Which one was it?
[288:23.76]R2 Protector, right?
[288:33.70]We can't see the deck.
[288:37.22]Well, if you had not been goofing around so much, we wouldn't be so zoomed in.
[288:43.58]You guys were goofing around.
[288:44.76]Alright.
[288:54.00]Only, like, seven more cards to pick up.
[289:03.79]You're the kind of person that punishes the whole class for one person's mistake?
[289:09.96]I'm fairly certain it would be at okay.
[289:12.44]Hold on now.
[289:12.92]I don't know.
[289:13.34]I don't know if I don't agree with that It was like 38% of people in the classroom.
[289:18.37]We're all throwing coins at me I'm gonna keep everybody and we're gonna have a long discussion about it It was like more than 40%
[289:38.68]Sunriver Spy.
[289:41.80]Do we even have a secret?
[289:44.06]I'm just being sabotaged.
[289:57.55]We can't see the deck.
[290:00.48]Okay, hold on.
[290:02.20]You guys have learned your lesson.
[290:07.97]secrets sacrifice all right let me pull hold on let me pull this back there you go now you can see the deck so see this is what we got to work with pretty balanced so far I almost just instantly clicked the zubat I mean what why why are you punishing all of us for the mistake of one person
[290:39.03]Oh, but yeah, I threw a rock into the blackboard.
[290:42.65]And so did the person next to me to the right and next to me to the left and two people behind me and three people in the front.
[290:49.99]How many people are in the classroom?
[290:51.95]There's like 26 people in the classroom.
[290:54.73]Like 13 or 14 of us threw rocks.
[290:57.83]Why are you punishing me?
[290:59.07]I'm one person.
[291:11.64]These last ones gotta count.
[291:17.06]Kick out ha- yeah, half of you guys are getting- going to the principal's office.
[291:27.63]German, we all hate you.
[291:29.21]This deck is fucking terrible.
[291:35.68]This is randomized cards.
[291:38.66]I'm taking the crocodile.
[291:40.58]I'm picking the next ones.
[291:42.12]I'm going to try to salvage this.
[291:43.40]It's over.
[291:43.74]Alright, you can pick this lot.
[291:54.50]I don't know.
[291:55.06]I have no idea.
[291:55.58]I don't know what half of these do.
[292:00.74]This one's... Murloc Knight is like really, really good.
[292:06.52]50-50 split.
[292:09.54]True silver champ.
[292:10.26]Consecration.
[292:12.34]Alright, we're good.
[292:13.06]Boys and girls.
[292:14.40]It's time.
[292:17.50]Check hero portrait.
[292:19.34]What about it?
[292:25.48]You took the last three expansions, threw dice in the air, like 200 dice, and just gave random cards.
[292:30.50]None of these work together.
[292:35.00]I'm gonna go 0 and 3 again, or like 1 and 3.
[292:37.90]And everyone's gonna make fun of me.
[292:40.75]This is what I'm gonna have to work with.
[292:42.29]I have to bake a cake with cement.
[292:44.65]And feed it to people.
[292:50.97]Let's go.
[293:01.18]Quick retire to redo the deck.
[293:02.64]I'm not.
[293:03.78]You're not gonna get me with that one.
[293:05.86]I'm not gonna sit here and get berated by a teacher who picked Steel Rager.
[293:10.83]Leave me alone!
[293:27.34]I'm going for it.
[293:28.20]And you know what?
[293:29.06]Even if I make bogus plays, I'm going to trust myself.
[293:31.86]And I'm going to play... This deck is so bad.
[293:35.60]So bad.
[293:36.24]It is the worst deck I think I've ever seen in the game.
[293:40.79]I mean, you guys have truly outdone yourselves.
[293:46.79]I picked this one.
[293:49.40]But, you know, I'm going to block out all the negative energy.
[293:52.10]I'm going to just play, even if I make mistakes.
[293:55.17]You guys aren't even here with me.
[293:56.45]I'm here.
[293:56.87]I'm just looking at the screen by myself.
[293:58.55]It's just me and this guy in a room together with a chessboard in front of us.
[294:02.49]So, with that being said.
[294:12.02]It's just me and the game.
[294:13.92]Me and the cards.
[294:16.42]I got the sunglasses on.
[294:20.25]Alright, that's fine.
[294:25.22]Let me take a look here.
[294:26.10]Okay, bingo.
[294:31.43]Don't silence that.
[294:45.84]Don't listen to them.
[294:46.48]I can hear them, but I can't... I can see their mouths moving, but I can't hear them.
[294:53.76]Wrong, wrong.
[294:55.22]Not gonna get it.
[294:57.60]Absolutely fucking fantastic.
[294:59.86]Keep it up.
[295:10.65]I'm not even reading chat.
[295:12.93]I'm playing this as if it was me in the bed.
[295:22.47]Let me see what you guys say.
[295:32.85]Let's all leave.
[295:34.01]No, I'm not supposed to be looking at you.
[295:36.85]I'm going to silence that.
[295:43.70]No, give each player a spare part.
[295:45.62]I want one.
[295:46.10]More justice.
[295:53.16]I don't think there are any secrets in the whole deck.
[296:09.61]Miss, hit the 1-1.
[296:10.22]Do it again.
[296:13.18]That's perfect.
[296:13.90]I'm fine with that.
[296:14.82]I got Avenging Wrath coming up here.
[296:24.08]When you take a picture of an Avenging Wrath turn, it's this one.
[296:29.24]Show me!
[296:52.91]Not looking I'm not looking over there Okay now
[297:21.91]I think I'm gonna taunt up this.
[297:26.19]Or no, um... No, get it up, get more.
[297:29.43]I'm gonna get fucking $100.
[297:39.77]I'm FIZZY!
[297:40.43]I'M FIZZY!
[297:41.35]I can't!
[297:44.69]I'm FIZZY!
[297:51.36]Mom, I'm in the bathroom!
[297:55.02]Mom just comes over and slides a $100 bill under the bathroom.
[297:58.48]I've been in the toilet for like fucking 45 minutes.
[298:01.10]And mom slides a $100 under the bathroom door.
[298:04.10]Mom, stop it!
[298:04.90]Get out of here!
[298:10.44]Uh, no, that was Flutters.
[298:12.00]Thank you so much for the fucking $100, Flutters.
[298:16.19]Been a fan of you and STIR for the better part of six years.
[298:19.59]I love your content and keep it up.
[298:20.93]Thank you so much.
[298:22.07]Glad to have you.
[298:23.15]You've been around for a long time.
[298:25.20]What do I do?
[298:33.74]And then I'm gonna taunt.
[298:35.12]Which one do I taunt, though?
[298:37.30]I'm itching my head.
[298:38.28]I'm turning fucking crazy.
[298:40.60]Taunt the Stormwind, I think.
[298:42.27]That's what I would do.
[298:48.05]I win.
[298:49.53]You said it couldn't be done.
[298:52.20]It's one game.
[298:53.02]Relax.
[299:15.25]all I need is okay he's getting a little desperate okay we're so close here comes the murloc
[299:38.95]I ran him a legendary minion to your hand.
[299:40.69]I can do them both Show me for justice
[300:10.51]Greed is good.
[300:11.37]Greed is good.
[300:12.19]Greed is good.
[300:20.71]1 and 0.
[300:20.87]Oh fuck!
[300:24.47]That did 25 damage!
[300:33.74]Not 0 and 3.
[300:37.98]1 and 0, actually.
[300:43.45]This deck is giving me the middle finger.
[300:46.05]You guys didn't even try to do that, and that's what you've done.
[301:03.16]It's gonna be 1 and 3.
[301:06.69]Not yet.
[301:07.11]1 and 0.
[301:10.43]See, I just have to trust myself.
[301:16.26]Even if the plays are not perfect.
[301:19.08]This is two, three, four, five.
[301:20.68]I shouldn't do anything.
[301:24.65]I get a perfect mana curve every turn.
[301:45.93]I was going to say, if that was a 1.
[301:46.87]Alright, again.
[301:55.16]Focus.
[302:02.17]Coin out the Exorcist.
[302:04.27]No.
[302:10.59]It's getting hot in here!
[302:14.04]Good.
[302:16.32]Play the curve.
[302:17.00]I'm not looking at you guys.
[302:18.60]Hold on.
[302:23.40]I'm just going to play the curve.
[302:33.51]That's okay.
[302:38.49]Although, I could true silver this.
[302:51.18]Mm-hmm.
[302:53.56]I got my Steel Rager, the thing that everyone was laughing at me for.
[302:57.49]We'll see if they're laughing now when he drops, like, a fucking, like, 2-5 right now.
[303:03.47]No.
[303:03.63]They're not laughing.
[303:07.63]Not yet.
[303:07.91]Let's see.
[303:20.21]Mmm...
[303:27.80]I'm just gonna taunt.
[303:31.42]Taunt and kill this.
[303:40.75]I don't want him to have any minions.
[303:47.63]I don't care if he kills this.
[303:49.05]He's a hunter.
[303:57.42]I got Goldifriss coming up here.
[303:59.10]And I've got Jouster.
[304:01.20]I got Jouster right now.
[304:03.00]Oh, that's not good.
[304:12.51]Ugh.
[304:16.57]I mean, if it is Snipe, then...
[304:27.20]Will this trigger it?
[304:28.92]If it is Snipe?
[304:36.92]Come on, give me that health.
[304:38.06]Yes!
[304:41.95]Wait, did somebody say Snipe is not in Arena?
[304:50.77]I'm gonna go with this.
[304:58.59]It's not.
[305:05.46]What is going on?
[305:07.44]Alright, here we go.
[305:25.67]Okay, we're good.
[305:26.57]We're good.
[305:46.59]Was he- was that just- was that be- was he being mean?
[305:48.77]Was that mean?
[305:50.73]No, I- get the minions out of here.
[305:52.11]I gotta get rid of those minions.
[305:56.27]Oh, hey, look at me!
[306:02.13]Hey, look at me!
[306:03.27]You need to get... Oh, never mind.
[306:04.61]We need to give it Rush.
[306:05.42]I was gonna say, the Steel Rager seems pretty good right now, doesn't it?
[306:14.90]I'm gonna do Bear into Silvermoon Portal.
[306:26.71]Excellent!
[306:41.26]So what is this secret then?
[306:42.34]I'm not familiar with some of the newer secrets.
[306:56.27]Is Rat Trap the one where if you play too many cards in a hand return, it'll summon like a big rat?
[307:05.21]Three cards, okay.
[307:10.44]He's thinking.
[307:10.90]There's another one.
[307:25.86]Alright, so we're gonna test.
[307:27.06]I'm gonna send him straight in.
[307:28.26]Alright, and it is explosive.
[307:34.58]Bring out the Rager.
[307:37.60]Rager gets rid of this guy.
[307:38.56]Uh-oh.
[307:46.85]It's Snake Trap.
[307:49.53]Interesting.
[307:55.74]I thought it was rat trap.
[307:59.02]Why did it have to be snakes?
[308:29.55]You don't get to do that twice, do you?
[308:38.02]I still have some pretty great minions here.
[308:39.64]I got Ogre and Stalker coming up next.
[308:42.10]Silence the snake.
[308:50.00]I'm not going to do that.
[309:04.76]A lot of rush.
[309:12.80]Well, alright, let's see here.
[309:13.78]I could just flood the board and just go face and win.
[309:17.95]Oh.
[309:33.15]That makes more sense.
[309:34.89]Let's see.
[309:43.85]Got anything else?
[309:53.28]Or did I win?
[309:54.44]You got a taunt?
[309:55.12]You got a spell?
[309:56.00]Are we 2-0?
[309:59.79]Alright.
[310:00.43]Alright, okay.
[310:01.17]Game over.
[310:01.83]Well played.
[310:02.57]2-0.
[310:24.58]Now he's gonna go 2 and 3, right?
[310:27.10]That's what you're gonna say.
[310:28.80]Yeah, there it is.
[310:35.09]Even if I get to like 11 and 0, it's not gonna happen.
[310:45.85]Uther versus Uther.
[310:49.27]I will fight with honor.
[310:51.50]I will command the light.
[310:56.33]Oh, there's the squire.
[311:02.11]Here comes a mirror match.
[311:04.44]That's not good.
[311:08.50]Ooh, that was a juicy one.
[311:10.82]Juicy one, buddy.
[311:11.91]One day, I'll be a real knight.
[311:27.42]Okay.
[311:29.10]Coin.
[311:30.78]Taunt.
[311:35.39]Oh, it's only supposed to be one attack.
[311:41.61]Okay.
[311:52.84]I'm not paying attention.
[311:53.80]I know they're probably making fun of you right now, but don't let them make fun of you.
[311:58.15]It was the right call.
[312:07.78]It's okay.
[312:08.46]Gotta get in there.
[312:16.72]Alright, hold on.
[312:18.23]Hold on just a second.
[312:27.59]I mean, let's not be hasty here.
[312:35.42]Not the time for equality.
[312:39.80]Why is this so much mana?
[312:41.14]Didn't there used to be two mana?
[313:00.40]Uh, do I hit?
[313:05.18]I don't.
[313:05.64]No.
[313:06.47]Don't do anything.
[313:11.89]He's going to get greedy.
[313:12.53]He's going to hit me in the face.
[313:23.84]Okay, not greedy.
[313:25.32]I have a consecration in here.
[313:27.22]Where is it?
[313:33.10]Oh, fuck!
[313:33.56]I forgot what that thing did!
[313:45.53]Um... Do I kill this, or do I let him kill it?
[313:50.63]Maybe.
[313:50.89]Alright, now just attack me in the face with that 5-1.
[314:05.18]I'm in a good spot, but it's not a terrible spot.
[314:09.60]Could be worse.
[314:17.58]Why is everyone doing the flatliner?
[314:21.76]Oh, you're saying the flatliners.
[314:23.74]Get down!
[314:33.42]Mmm.
[314:35.54]If I get a consecration right here, this is... I remember you could do a quality consecrate.
[314:42.45]That's not good.
[314:43.09]I mean, this is the only play is this.
[315:02.24]You guys aren't very supportive, are you?
[315:06.94]I need consecration.
[315:10.19]It's in here.
[315:11.45]That's not consecration!
[315:28.63]But it can at least take out the Mechanical Yeti.
[315:38.36]How did this happen?
[315:51.61]I started out with bad plays.
[315:54.27]I started out with bad cards.
[315:56.65]This is not over yet.
[315:58.67]I just have to draw Consecration.
[316:00.89]And we're back to square one.
[316:08.42]If I draw Consecration right now, the board is empty.
[316:16.26]That's not Consecration.
[316:18.86]That's it.
[316:24.72]Two and one.
[316:42.07]Sometimes you lose them.
[316:43.25]It's alright.
[316:43.79]We'll get it back.
[316:50.55]We'll get them next time.
[316:51.49]We will.
[316:55.66]Yeah, we have exponentially improved.
[316:58.88]This was an 0 and 3 stream.
[317:00.64]It's now a 2 and 1 stream.
[317:03.30]Imagine improving by 2 to 300% over the course of 5 hours.
[317:06.41]That's a large increase.
[317:08.11]200% of 0 is 0.
[317:26.87]Now, the 0 and 3 was like... It wasn't actually 0.
[317:41.32]It was like 0 point... What the hell was that?
[317:49.83]Oh.
[317:51.21]Oh.
[317:55.25]It was like 0.4.
[317:59.77]Dash three.
[318:01.67]So 200% of that is like, we're doing fine.
[318:10.54]That's the wrong one.
[318:14.12]You picked the wrong one to do that too.
[318:23.79]Mathematically it was zero, but emotionally it was a bigger number.
[318:26.25]Yes!
[318:36.90]Okay.
[318:39.06]I think I'm gonna just throw out the weaponized piñata.
[318:44.25]In fact, I am.
[318:55.16]This is a good Fortnite reference.
[318:58.28]Have you guys even ever played Fortnite?
[319:00.69]I see so many references, but I don't think you guys even play it.
[319:09.67]Ooh.
[319:13.33]Alright, what's more important?
[319:16.28]Two and two and a two-cost minion, or getting a taunt out and hitting him in the face?
[319:21.36]That's cooler to me.
[319:29.37]Things are looking up.
[319:35.39]We got Boldafriss Ogre coming out next.
[319:46.56]Do I get these next turn?
[319:50.26]My remedies are all natural.
[319:53.72]No, he has to trade.
[319:56.09]He's gonna lose both.
[319:59.61]I mean, yeah, he can draw all he wants.
[320:03.61]But he's dead next turn.
[320:09.84]Where did he get this, like, synergy from?
[320:14.76]Oh.
[320:27.91]This is a pretty good spot.
[320:37.49]He drew a bunch of cards.
[320:38.39]Right now he's thinking, oh fuck, he's got big damage.
[320:47.24]See?
[320:48.14]I'm alright with that.
[320:48.84]We're getting a legendary out of this.
[320:51.20]He had to take a lot of hits for that.
[320:52.92]What do we got?
[320:56.71]Varian Wrynn.
[321:02.43]That could be the victory right there.
[321:07.84]I mean, obviously we're gonna Divine Shield the Ogre, right?
[321:10.90]I mean, we got a good play here.
[321:13.66]Divine Shield the Ogre, Taunt, or Taunt, Divine Shield, Taunt.
[321:28.04]And then, get it out here!
[321:39.74]Next, we got Varian.
[321:58.19]That don't matter, because... You ready for this?
[322:04.01]You still have to get through that.
[322:08.53]I'm not gonna... No, no, no, no, no.
[322:09.98]That's a mistake.
[322:11.68]I'm not gonna play Varian.
[322:12.66]No.
[322:12.98]We're just gonna go face.
[322:14.86]You gotta get through.
[322:15.38]And I got the quality.
[322:21.14]Six...
[322:23.19]Get rid of you.
[322:29.53]That's... There's too many people on the board.
[322:40.94]No, I'm not playing it yet.
[322:42.90]I'm not gonna play it.
[322:43.46]No, no, I'm not playing it.
[322:44.16]There's four.
[322:44.76]There's gonna be... I've just dropped... Should I play it?
[322:50.14]Next turn, next turn.
[322:50.88]I'm doing next turn.
[322:53.35]I have 10 mana!
[323:10.22]God damn it.
[323:11.30]I... I... I'm... I'm... I'm... It's alright.
[323:19.59]Check this shit out.
[323:20.37]You ready?
[323:21.43]I'm gonna... I'm gonna Equality right now and kill everything.
[323:25.57]And then I'm gonna play Varian next turn.
[323:34.25]Go do it now.
[323:36.92]I'm doing it right now.
[323:38.40]Good.
[323:38.82]Not good.
[323:50.38]Pretty good.
[323:50.98]Alright.
[323:51.48]Now we just go face and fucking win the game.
[324:06.93]I got too much.
[324:07.83]There's too much going on here.
[324:09.21]It's too overwhelming.
[324:16.84]And I still have equality.
[324:25.91]Sixteen, what's he got?
[324:27.93]What the fuck is this?
[324:30.66]How did you get two of these?
[324:31.56]Hold on, what do I have for health?
[324:37.84]How much does this cost?
[324:39.22]That's a six cost minion?
[324:50.46]Alright, so we've got 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
[324:55.58]12.
[324:55.60]Oh, shit.
[324:59.23]Do I just equality and kill everything?
[325:04.25]And then put the... face?
[325:09.05]Just go off?
[325:09.67]Okay.
[325:25.92]Oh!
[325:29.58]I'm fucking panicking.
[325:41.05]This is okay.
[325:41.97]Yeah, this is okay.
[325:48.26]Answer the call of the light.
[325:50.92]I still have the quality.
[325:51.72]If he can summon anything he wants.
[325:54.48]No, the game's over.
[325:56.54]I don't think he can kill everything.
[325:59.70]Oh god, give me a break.
[326:10.76]What?
[326:11.32]He's got so many fucking healing synergies!
[326:19.71]Well, can I have my consecration now?
[326:26.59]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!
[326:32.84]If I played the Stealth Goblin, I would've won.
[326:37.46]Alright, I'm gonna kill... What the fuck do I want to get rid of here?
[326:54.82]Extended BM.
[327:00.94]Gotta kill that 7-1.
[327:01.60]Perfect catch!
[327:08.56]Must move quickly.
[327:20.97]Reporting for duty.
[327:25.83]What am I doing wrong?
[327:28.05]That was oka- That was okay?
[327:33.69]I'm t- Alright, you have to remember, I'm not very good at this game and I look over here and I see like a wall of people fucking holding up notes, like sticking them to the wall.
[327:46.40]Hey, look at this!
[327:47.98]You have to do it like this quick!
[327:50.18]You got like fucking sticky notes all over my fucking windows!
[327:53.70]And I'm just like panicking.
[328:04.80]Where's my Avenging Wrath?
[328:07.19]Oh, my Consecration and I win!
[328:08.81]He forgot about the dragons.
[328:16.71]Oh, and then you get equalitied.
[328:21.34]Equality.
[328:22.14]Dead.
[328:22.86]Two dragons.
[328:29.41]Or, face two dragons, Noble Sacrifice, and fuck it.
[328:58.15]I can't, like, play this with people, like, watching.
[329:01.11]I seriously... I look over and I just, like, I can't focus on the game.
[329:09.87]It's like I need to, like, concentrate.
[329:23.58]Well, there it is.
[329:24.52]Thanks for it, fucking five turns late.
[329:36.01]I shouldn't even use the equality!
[329:46.48]Now we're just topdecking against each other.
[329:48.12]I could've won.
[329:57.03]Fine.
[329:58.07]I'll deal.
[330:00.80]Yeah, and I'm also playing with, like, fucking anvils on my back.
[330:05.88]Look at this guy's deck.
[330:07.46]It's so good.
[330:08.42]I'm, like, dragging anvils with this deck.
[330:18.07]Behold the might of Stormwind.
[330:20.65]Reporting for duty.
[330:30.46]If I only played the goblin... oh well.
[330:39.39]I think he's healed... like, 14 to 15 times this game.
[330:47.71]Does this still seem possible?
[331:03.05]Why do I have coins?
[331:20.98]What else do I have in here?
[331:22.78]I really could have won too, just... I get too overwhelmed.
[331:25.54]This is why I don't play this game.
[331:43.89]Not over yet.
[331:46.90]Hey, it ain't over yet!
[332:12.01]This turned into a top-deck war.
[332:15.65]Because I didn't play the goblin and have lethal.
[332:25.90]One of us gets something big, it's over.
[332:37.40]Believe in your deck.
[332:38.52]Alright, let's draw.
[332:42.51]all right what do we get what well I did I did did somebody say candy he fell for it hilarious
[333:16.41]It's a coin.
[333:18.92]And you got a legendary too?
[333:19.86]Where are my legendaries?
[333:26.72]I can... Hold on.
[333:28.42]Topdeck something crazy.
[333:29.90]Come on.
[333:30.34]Come on.
[333:31.20]Come on.
[333:32.54]Here we go.
[333:33.08]Come on.
[333:34.08]Come on.
[333:34.40]Let me just pull this out of my asshole right now.
[333:41.56]So, let me... I'm going to take this very... I need to get rid of...
[333:46.79]Justicar.
[333:49.62]And then... Alright.
[333:58.65]And then should I hit you, too?
[334:01.17]Should I just completely trade everything and then do it?
[334:06.71]Bad play, what are you talking about?
[334:07.86]Wait, wait, what's going on?
[334:22.59]If I pull this out of my ass... If I win with Silverhand Recruits... No, there's no way.
[334:30.79]He's gonna get two armor every turn.
[334:33.44]I'm gonna get fatigued.
[334:43.72]He only needs two turns to win.
[334:45.10]Three turns to win.
[334:47.16]He's gonna hit me twice.
[334:47.82]I need a heal.
[334:48.38]Do I have any heals?
[335:03.84]Alright.
[335:05.67]Come on.
[335:06.03]A taunt.
[335:12.62]I don't lose though, hold on.
[335:14.24]Cause that's- this is dead.
[335:15.72]I have to trade everything.
[335:20.97]Use the coin!
[335:21.59]The coin doesn't do anything!
[335:22.95]This is the most clown dog shit fucking game ever.
[335:45.43]I need something ridiculous.
[335:48.73]I have one health.
[335:57.69]Alright, come on.
[335:59.09]Something.
[336:14.48]I would have been three and one.
[336:16.00]No, I really am going to be two and fucking three.
[336:35.97]Uther versus Rexha.
[336:39.55]Let the hunt begin.
[336:41.79]I will fight with honor.
[336:48.10]I'm so sad right now.
[336:52.82]This is like watching a car crash in slow motion.
[336:54.80]This is like watching a car crash in fast motion.
[337:05.14]Alright, I'm gonna do th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th-th
[337:21.12]It's 20 minutes per match, not high motion.
[337:28.86]It's alright.
[337:30.56]It's okay.
[337:31.70]Coin?
[337:32.14]Uhhh... What does that do?
[337:38.44]Summons a 3-2 big bad wolf.
[337:41.97]Get the taunt out here.
[337:54.30]It's like watching a car crash that keeps happening.
[338:05.25]Well, I have Divine Shield now.
[338:09.45]Divine Shield, get rid of this.
[338:14.03]And then play the Gloatron.
[338:33.39]Alright, you know what this kind of feels like?
[338:36.05]So I went to a... I went to a cake competition.
[338:39.92]And I brought with me, um, boxed Little Debbie cake.
[338:45.10]By the way, I've never made a cake before.
[338:47.78]At this cake competition, there are like 500 other people here that have been making cakes for 10 years.
[338:55.92]And while I'm making my cake, just over there, I don't plan on winning.
[339:02.00]Everybody else making their cakes are, like, shouting out, Hey, your cake sucks!
[339:09.47]Your cake is gross!
[339:11.85]My cake is delicious!
[339:13.49]Alright, what do I want to do here?
[339:25.84]Uh... What do you got in here?
[339:41.50]It's definitely explosive trap.
[339:48.87]Oh, I called it!
[339:49.51]Called it!
[339:49.95]I called it!
[339:50.41]You have 400 hours?
[339:55.75]I have 400 hours... I had like... I'm lying.
[339:58.31]I had like 200 hours in this game in 2013.

[342:04.96]Alright, what's this?
[342:05.70]Deal three damage to all minions.
[342:10.01]Well, this is not going to be good.
[342:13.93]He's going to clear everything.
[342:14.79]I mean, I just have to do this, right?
[342:21.23]If only I had the silence.
[342:29.45]Get that coffee pasta shit out of here.
[342:33.32]Get that coffee pasta shit the fuck out of here.
[342:44.73]I don't want to see that shit.
[342:50.11]Reporting for duty.
[342:55.06]For justice.
[343:11.19]The single most predictable result in the chatroom.
[343:14.07]I know, I know.
[343:24.94]I can't- put it in- put it in cake only mode, emote only.
[343:30.00]I don't want us to get- emote only!
[343:32.38]I don't want- they don't deserve my cake.
[343:41.98]Emoto- Somebody gotta- Somebody gotta fuck you in right before it happens.
[343:55.77]You don't deserve my cake.
[344:01.96]What's- what's going on?
[344:03.96]He just released a hound?
[344:08.93]Well, that's alright because I got- Bang bang.
[344:17.81]He's kind of on the ropes.
[344:28.31]Just don't kill me.
[344:30.03]Let me go three and two.
[344:33.23]That's a pretty good KD in a server.
[344:43.26]That's above 500.
[344:47.22]Alright, three, four, five, six, seven.
[344:51.48]Are these mech... I'm dumping everybody.
[344:57.87]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[345:03.27]I gotta go for it.
[345:07.97]I want a legendary!
[345:09.73]No, yes, do it!
[345:14.29]Battle!
[345:18.50]I have Lethal right now.
[345:36.82]He has to kill something.
[345:39.70]And I've got Dr. Blast.
[345:45.90]He has to get rid of everything.
[345:49.19]That's a fucking mech!
[345:50.23]Did I just lose?
[345:51.71]No, I didn't just lose.
[345:52.75]I can't fucking believe it.
[345:56.06]Oh my god, I can't fucking believe it.
[346:01.52]That's great synergy.
[346:02.62]I don't have a single fucking synergy card in the entire deck.
[346:06.73]In the whole deck!
[346:19.74]I don't... Whatever!
[346:20.90]It's over!
[346:21.38]No, I won.
[346:32.37]I just won the game.
[346:34.03]I just won the game with one health.
[346:43.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[346:44.05]Just make sure I have it.
[346:51.18]There you go, guys.
[346:52.16]Oh, yeah.
[346:52.62]Look at me.
[346:52.98]He's not even very good at the video game.
[346:54.60]I don't think he's very good at this.
[346:55.80]All right.
[346:58.91]Take it off emote only.
[346:59.71]They're behaving.
[347:20.04]You guys, would you like some of my cake?
[347:26.92]I made it special for you!
[347:28.44]I made it special for you guys!
[347:29.78]My stream was crashing because of the emotes.
[347:48.16]See, I'm saving you.
[347:49.50]I'm okay with three and three.
[347:50.38]That's even.
[347:53.16]No, that's not hello.
[347:54.33]I tried to say... Where's hello?
[347:59.55]That's like ultimate ultra BM.
[348:01.53]Like, I did not...
[348:18.55]Turn one coin.
[348:19.71]That's right.
[348:24.25]Not gonna... Really?
[348:25.25]Okay.
[348:31.80]I can do that too.
[348:32.46]Am I gonna get absolutely fucked if I start playing this game without spending money?
[348:43.16]Um... No, they give you...
[348:47.54]They give you packs.
[348:48.62]They do.
[348:58.05]You get, like, five to ten packs?
[349:02.27]I mean, you could do a Reno.
[349:10.34]Actually, rank 50 is pretty fair.
[349:17.59]Let's keep the control up here.
[349:21.45]I wonder, do you think he's got like a polymorph?
[349:23.35]Should I get this out there right now?
[349:25.05]Or should I throw out the herald and face?
[349:28.67]I'm gonna herald and face.
[349:32.99]Or spellward and haste.
[349:40.74]Go back to Mario Yahtzee?
[349:42.56]I already dominated that game to the point where I don't even care anymore.
[349:54.08]Bring in a Gurubashi Berserker.
[349:58.48]Now this is a scenario where I'm going to potentially equality this.
[350:04.68]No.
[350:05.61]I could.
[350:07.09]It wouldn't be that bad.
[350:10.09]I'm not sure that would be the worst thing.
[350:13.65]Or to get the Tuskar out here.
[350:16.71]I wonder...
[350:28.89]Okay.
[350:29.63]Next turn, we have Murloc and Hero Power.
[350:39.59]Star.
[350:58.62]Next spell, what do you got?
[351:00.40]Oh, that's not good.
[351:01.10]Plain Cannon.
[351:01.80]Fuck.
[351:07.77]No, okay.
[351:08.81]I could do... Sword and a... I could do Sword and Equality and kill this.
[351:24.98]That keeps me alive.
[351:31.56]Or sword and... Oh, fuck it.
[351:37.11]Quality's four mana.
[351:41.49]Shit.
[351:41.93]I don't know what to do.
[351:45.72]I think I'm just gonna have to do Murloc and hit Hero Power.
[351:56.67]Ow, I'm itching my head again.
[352:05.67]It is sending just stuff to die, but I need to put... I have to have something here.
[352:12.11]Otherwise, he's just going to start to destroy me.
[352:14.69]And it is a terrible murloc, but at least it's not terrible.
[352:18.89]Still plenty of cards.
[352:30.09]Interesting.
[352:31.77]He wants to keep this alive so he can do that.
[352:35.67]Okay.
[352:36.05]Alright.
[352:37.55]Um...
[352:57.97]Ogre and Glowtron, I think, is the only thing I can do.
[353:08.46]You have to get rid of it.
[353:12.72]I'm happy I'm here for Jeremy to teach the game.
[353:14.75]Yeah, I've got some strategies here.
[353:18.70]He lost every game.
[353:19.64]That's a lie.
[353:20.32]Don't listen to that.
[353:21.80]I'm 3-2 right now.
[353:23.54]At least be truthful about it.
[353:33.97]He thought about it.
[353:34.67]He's not trading.
[353:38.26]Huh.
[353:41.76]So...
[353:45.67]Just get some minions on the board and fucking- what does this do?
[353:48.09]Whenever you cast a spell summon a random three cost beast.
[353:50.57]That's not good.
[353:58.94]I think it is time for equality.
[354:04.52]It's time for equality!
[354:17.21]Trade first?
[354:19.75]I mean, does it not matter?
[354:21.43]I mean, I guess.
[354:25.17]Not that one?
[354:33.36]Wrong trade.
[354:33.72]Um...
[354:46.67]I, I, I, you guys saying the robot and I thought it was the, the ro, uh, whatever.
[354:52.00]I'm gonna stick to peeing my pants on stream.
[354:57.56]That's probably easier.
[355:02.79]That's it.
[355:03.33]I lose.
[355:15.92]Should've drawn Con- I wish I drew Consecration in six games, that would be fun.
[355:45.56]That's it.
[355:57.15]No, no more Arena.
[355:58.27]Arena just like... I was like happy and chipper when we were playing in the solo adventure.
[356:04.72]And then I go to Arena and I play against players that have cards and it becomes a disaster.
[356:19.32]No, actually, I had a lot of fun.
[356:22.50]I'm so happy that I streamed this game for one reason, for the comedic purpose of being the number one Hearthstone streamer on Twitch for like 45 minutes, or like a couple hours or something, and having rank 25 next to my name.
[356:36.78]That was just worth it, completely.
[356:40.74]It just was.
[356:54.73]I was in the number one spot for like... what?
[356:58.40]20 minutes or 30 minutes or something?
[357:02.12]But that's gonna be it.
[357:04.18]That brings us right to like a nice perfect clean six hours.
[357:18.22]It's fun to do this every once in a while.
[357:20.02]Play like the... the game that a lot of people play.
[357:27.03]Even if I wasn't playing that well and it was just kind of all over the place.
[357:31.41]I still had a lot of fun.
[357:32.28]It was fucking great.
[357:37.64]So tomorrow, we are never going to see this again.
[357:41.54]I'm gonna get... Good night, everybody.
[357:43.70]See you next time.
[357:44.38]See you tomorrow.
[357:45.24]Gonna be playing Cooking Simulator tomorrow.
[357:46.96]Have a great day.
[357:47.80]Have a great night, guys.
[357:49.14]Stream's gonna turn up and I'm just gonna scream into my hands.
[357:55.15]No.
[357:56.96]Uh, tomorrow we're gonna come back.
[357:58.68]I was supposed to play Cooking Simulator today, but it wasn't out.
[358:02.99]So tomorrow is gonna be even more probably of a shitshow.
[358:10.53]But the game actually releases tomorrow.
[358:12.43]It's the only reason why we're not playing it today.
[358:13.71]Do you have any plans to play?
[358:18.46]Okay, I'm gonna give you my actual classic WoW plan.
[358:23.45]I probably am just gonna play it off-stream.
[358:26.36]And on-stream, maybe sometimes when we do something fun.
[358:30.32]Maybe we'll try to like raid Orgrimmar or something with like 50 people.
[358:34.86]Just try to take over the capital or something for like certain streams.
[358:38.13]Might be fun to do.
[358:43.19]But off-stream, I plan on just kind of casually playing it.
[358:47.70]I'll probably make a guild.
[358:49.86]I'll let everybody know the server I'm on if you guys want to play it.
[358:52.85]Just have like a group of people that just play it off and on.
[359:04.20]Should be fun.
[359:05.42]Looking forward to it.
[359:08.04]Try to actually take down like Onyxio or something on stream with chat.
[359:14.26]Whatever the guild is, try to do it.
[359:16.72]Without any voice over IP and no communication.
[359:21.08]It would be fucking hilarious.
[359:28.33]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[359:29.67]If you've taken off, I'm going to go just take a quick pee break.
[359:32.63]I'll be right back.
[359:34.57]And we'll do the bits and the subs and everything.
[359:36.85]There were a shitload of subs.
[359:37.95]There was a ton of fucking money.
[359:39.29]I know it was like a little sub train and stuff in the beginning and we were making jokes about it.
[359:43.99]But that was a lot of subs and a lot of fucking money in the beginning of the stream.
[359:48.75]Hope you enjoyed it as always.
[359:49.77]I had a blast.
[359:52.39]At least I got to three wins.
[359:55.39]Thank you for watching.
[359:56.01]I'll see you tomorrow.
[359:58.11]for Cooking Simulator.
[360:00.43]Don't miss it.
[360:02.79]I will be right back.
[360:05.52]See you soon.
[362:52.07]Alright.
[362:53.07]Hey.
[362:56.25]What does this mic peak?
[363:01.01]Save it.
[363:02.41]I've been a manual save in a while.
[363:07.67]That kind of wasn't mic peak-y, right?
[363:11.11]Angry chat.
[363:13.68]What are these clips?
[363:14.96]You are going to get frustrated on this stream.
[363:19.31]You're going to be mad at me.
[363:20.69]You're going to yell at me.
[363:22.09]You're going to call me names.
[363:24.87]Anything else?
[363:25.51]And I'm going to puff my chest out and be like, yeah, right.
[363:29.36]I kind of did that a few times.
[363:30.32]All right, let me get off like that.
[363:50.60]Let's get the correct screen on.
[363:53.66]Why not, right?
[363:59.18]Let's go over the bits from earlier.
[364:03.58]We had so many... Just wait till you see the subs fly by.
[364:08.43]They're going to... Oh my god.
[364:10.99]This is... This is ridiculous.
[364:15.39]I'm scrolling fucking forever how many subs there were today, for community subs.
[364:24.26]Wow.
[364:30.90]Yeah, when you see the credits, just wait until you see these fly by.
[364:36.03]Anyways, let's start back here about six plus, six hours ago or so.
[364:42.24]We had, uh, CutTag for the $8.
[364:45.44]Thank you for eight bucks.
[364:47.82]Whoa dude, nice card.
[364:49.20]I got, I did, I got like three legendaries in 20 packs.
[364:51.64]That's actually really fucking good.
[364:53.08]That's really good.
[365:01.44]But thank you, CutTag.
[365:03.26]Oh gee, Jeffdor, thanks for the $10.
[365:06.86]Says he doesn't want to get hyped and energetic, but then today he is screaming in the first 30 minutes.
[365:14.36]Yeah, but, like, my brain is hyped up, but my body isn't.
[365:16.92]I get to just kind of... Whatever, the other way around.
[365:26.28]It's comfy.
[365:29.86]I'm comfortable.
[365:31.54]You know?
[365:32.94]Even if I yell a little bit, I use my nasal patches for the air to come out, not my stomach, so I'm fine.
[365:41.64]Hopefully he did well in Hearthstone.
[365:43.54]Nobody tell him.
[365:45.62]Nobody tell him.
[365:50.64]But thank you OG Jephter for the 10 bucks.
[365:54.64]Really appreciate it.
[365:59.76]And then I think I missed this earlier.
[366:01.82]Some guy gave another $50 earlier.
[366:03.88]It said Doom, OST, or Riot.
[366:06.94]Thank you for the huge amount of money.
[366:09.82]It was $150 I think today.
[366:11.22]Yeah, just look at the fucking board.
[366:15.16]my god there was hundreds of dollars just running in at the same time if I missed something I'm sorry I missed something if I did but thank you nonetheless so many community subs uh thank you dots me dot is me dot see me for the five dollars and they just say hype hype
[366:44.18]Yes.
[366:44.94]Yes, yes, yes.
[366:48.21]They also say Pride 100.
[366:54.67]Thank you for the $5.
[366:55.72]Thank you HackItFast for $10.
[366:59.02]HackItFast, recommend me a good whiskey.
[367:01.20]Also, I eat ass.
[367:03.87]Oh, I got that earlier.
[367:04.98]Yeah.
[367:05.62]If you want to spend a lot of money, Johnny Walker Blue.
[367:07.94]If you want to spend a little bit of money, like $30, $40 a bottle, Johnny Walker Black, Johnny Walker Red.
[367:13.60]Johnny Walker is good if you like whiskey.
[367:18.21]Am I excited about E3?
[367:18.99]I'm going to come covering E3.
[367:20.15]We're getting a full-on professional coverage from me.
[367:24.85]Don't suggest Red.
[367:28.13]Well, it depends, you know?
[367:29.11]Some people just want to... You want to spend like, you know, 25, 30 bucks on a bottle of alcohol.
[367:38.80]Johnny Walker is like saying to drink Budweiser if you like lagers.
[367:41.60]What?
[367:43.40]Johnny Walker Blue is really good.
[367:53.01]Johnny Walker Blue is a very, very high quality alcohol.
[368:03.20]I mean, it's not like Jack Daniels.
[368:05.88]Those are two different kinds of... Those are two different things, but... Jack Daniels is the Budweiser of whiskey.
[368:17.95]I'm gonna have to disagree with you on that.
[368:22.56]It's all the same shit.
[368:23.52]Just go get a jug of vodka for five bucks.
[368:28.24]You could.
[368:38.10]But thank you, Hack It Fast.
[368:40.02]Also, Glen Fetish is another great one.
[368:48.00]If you like whiskey.
[368:53.31]Whiskey tastes like a house fire.
[368:59.11]No, it doesn't.
[369:06.09]Hey Quats, or cats, thanks for $5.
[369:10.65]Sorry, I'm just a common $500 bit donation in that pack.
[369:21.58]If you weren't here in the beginning of the stream, when I was opening the packs, $50 would come out.
[369:27.48]I would open a card pack and like 20 community subs would show up.
[369:31.41]Sorry, just a common 500 bit donation in that one.
[369:37.25]$5 is still a lot of money to give anybody.
[369:39.52]Thank you for $5.
[369:42.60]I'm honored to accept it.
[369:47.16]Oh, I hear a little barking.
[369:48.70]Otto.
[369:51.29]Thank you also to Katz again for $5.
[369:53.27]They say Pride 500 and then... Beater.
[369:58.03]Beater.
[369:58.23]Otto, what are you barking at down there?
[370:06.28]He never barks like this.
[370:12.57]Listen to him.
[370:13.65]I've never heard him bark like that.
[370:16.67]Hold on.
[370:16.99]Can you hear that?
[370:19.57]He never barks.
[370:22.90]Hold on.
[370:23.22]Let me go see.
[370:24.60]Hold on.
[370:25.50]Let me go investigate it.
[370:26.76]We're back.
[371:06.28]Yeah, it was an intruder.
[371:07.82]I just, like, I fucking punched him all the way.
[371:09.62]He flew all the way to the police station and they put him in handcuffs.
[371:19.53]That was Kim.
[371:21.05]She was just, uh... She was outside and now she's back inside.
[371:31.05]I got my Hearthstone sponsor check.
[371:33.34]I didn't know.
[371:35.69]I did not.
[371:38.97]No, I did not.
[371:41.03]No, no, no, no.
[371:42.25]All right.
[371:43.03]Thank you for the bits.
[371:44.29]Here we go.
[371:48.53]We got Night Team $50.
[371:51.19]It was $50 so many times.
[371:52.33]You guys are fucking so generous.
[371:53.71]Thank you.
[371:56.29]Jamie2803, thanks for the $10.
[371:57.61]They say, German Heart, thank you for the $10.
[372:00.86]Thanks.
[372:07.37]There's a little room right there.
[372:10.09]A flare pancake, thanks for the $2.75.
[372:11.99]Hey, Jerm, I'm back from my trip to the Philippines.
[372:16.44]I had a great time, but the whole time I was worried that without my constant attention, you'd turn into some normie streamer.
[372:24.08]Sorry, Jerm, I won't let this happen again.
[372:34.92]It didn't happen.
[372:38.95]It was you.
[372:41.85]It didn't happen.
[372:43.11]It didn't come true.
[372:47.77]Whatever.
[372:48.15]I played Hearthstone on one stream.
[372:52.85]What's the big deal?
[372:53.53]I played Hearthstro- I played Hearthstone for like fucking five and a half hours.
[372:58.53]One time.
[372:59.01]I just wanted to do it.
[373:01.10]We're just fucking throwing the feelers out, guys.
[373:03.88]I had a good time.
[373:18.90]No, you did.
[373:19.24]Yes, I did.
[373:19.70]I thought it was fun.
[373:28.70]I had a lot of fun too.
[373:31.40]This is definitely not the worst stream.
[373:33.34]Yeah.
[373:33.72]What?
[373:33.86]You're going to put this in the 2019 worst stream category?
[373:38.73]No, I call bullshit on that one.
[373:50.62]worse than days gone I'm sorry but that is not correct days gone was fun too there hasn't even been a candidate for 2019 worst stream I'm on a roll this year what was that there really hasn't been has there been like a like like a worst of 2019 stream
[374:22.25]We are going into the middle of June.
[374:30.34]I did, I played Mario Tennis last year.
[374:31.90]I'm on a roll this year.
[374:47.89]I could give you at least two or three by the time we got to March last year.
[374:53.85]Must be that fucking fresh Vegas air.
[374:56.36]Except Vegas air quality is, like, some of the worst in the country, I think.
[375:06.28]It's up there somewhere.
[375:09.00]Air is overrated.
[375:11.52]But anyways, I had a lot of fun.
[375:13.09]I did.
[375:14.49]I really did.
[375:15.49]You can tell that I'm not having fun because I'm not, like, engaging and I'm just sitting there like, whatever.
[375:19.97]Okay, so, um...
[375:22.66]Yeah, uh, I think I'm gonna move on.
[375:24.98]I'm gonna do something else.
[375:27.11]I had a great fucking time.
[375:29.91]With all of you, okay?
[375:43.62]There was a moment where you screamed a chat.
[375:45.40]Are you excited?
[375:48.76]Yeah, like I was excited.

[377:34.03]I can't.
[377:34.47]I'm naked.
[377:36.49]Your deck sucks and you're bald.
[377:37.90]Oh yeah, I forgot.

[377:46.92]So vicious!
[377:49.72]How did I raise such vicious children?
[378:01.05]We learned it from you.
[378:02.45]No, you didn't.
[378:03.19]I said, have a great night, hope you have a good time, and take care, guys.
[378:08.60]How did I raise such vicious, vicious...
[378:22.96]Are we going to get a Death Stranding stream?
[378:27.62]Maybe.
[378:29.25]Probably.
[378:30.65]Looks interesting.
[378:36.41]There are a couple of big games that are coming out that I know I'll be playing.
[378:42.05]We talked about Cyberpunk 2077 last night, and whenever that comes out, absolutely.
[378:47.94]Absolutely.
[378:51.85]Can we get a Pac-Man stream?
[378:52.90]I'd love to just go back and play that Super Nintendo Pac-Man is a moron game.
[379:03.08]And try to actually beat it.
[379:05.64]It would be hell on earth, but I would try.
[379:12.83]But yeah.
[379:19.03]Uh...

[380:25.32]Good game.
[380:29.04]That deck was fucking pretty good.
[380:30.67]You're a pretty good player.
[380:32.43]Hey.
[380:33.51]Nice job.
[380:34.95]See you on the field.
[380:40.45]But Heartache Cube, thanks for the $10.
[380:41.61]Dermot, it's my birthday in two days.
[380:45.15]Please be my dad.
[380:47.62]I can wish you a happy birthday, but I cannot be your father.
[380:54.54]Thank you for the $10, and happy birthday.
[380:58.24]In exactly two days from now.
[381:02.48]Please.
[381:04.62]Alright, dad for a minute.
[381:05.68]Here you go.
[381:06.20]You got 10 seconds of dad.
[381:10.21]Son?
[381:13.13]Nice work.
[381:14.55]You played good out there.
[381:16.83]See you on the field.
[381:18.53]And then a little, like... Like, just a little, like, uh... Like, I put my fist down, and I give you, like, a wee bump, and it's just... There you go, son.
[381:29.52]And I got to... Motherfucking Juan.
[381:32.94]See how tall that grass has gotten?
[381:37.10]And I got a call from your teacher.
[381:39.80]You fell asleep in class, and then when you woke up, you made a fart noise with your mouth?
[381:44.32]Go to your room.
[381:48.94]I mean, with my Johnny Waka Blue.
[381:53.85]How did I raise such a vicious son?
[381:57.01]How did I raise such a vicious son?
[382:13.74]Go back to the wall, Dad.
[382:17.23]No, I'm not going back in there.
[382:18.65]It smells in there.
[382:23.75]Hey, but hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[382:26.80]And you look over your shoulder.
[382:28.78]And I give you a wink and I go, you're my one and only.
[382:35.68]And then we both nod.
[382:46.04]Let's go get hot dogs tomorrow.
[382:53.00]I think I just... Yeah, somebody just said, is that a coming-of-age movie?
[382:56.14]I think that was, like, a movie... I think that's every movie that has, like, a dad in it.
[383:07.00]Um... That was a long ten seconds.
[383:09.02]Yes, it was.
[383:10.12]Uh, okay.
[383:10.82]But happy birthday.
[383:11.56]Okay.
[383:13.22]It was a pleasure being your dad for ten seconds, which was actually like four minutes.
[383:21.24]But no, seriously, thank you so much for ten bucks.
[383:23.87]FreudianWeapon, thanks for five dollars.
[383:25.47]Maybe it's because I think you're insanely cool, but I always have the uncanny need to play games that you streamed.
[383:30.51]I played Hearthstone once five years ago.
[383:33.73]Didn't care for it then, yet now I found my cursor gliding toward the download button.
[383:38.66]Uh-oh.
[383:39.70]But seriously, keep doing your thing.
[383:40.84]Have a good night.
[383:41.58]GermanHeart.
[383:43.74]Yeah, I don't know.
[383:44.28]I just got, like, bit by the bug for some reason.
[383:48.90]A few old games that I used to play more than, like, three, four, five years ago have started to creep up into my brain again.
[383:56.24]They're like, yeah, I remember that was fun.
[383:59.65]Don't be surprised if you see some more of it.
[384:14.11]Thinking about downloading Hearthstone again.
[384:15.41]I really do like this solo stuff.
[384:21.03]It's so replayable.
[384:22.25]The other ones, the first two or three years of the game when they made those adventures, they were cool.
[384:28.11]But these new adventures, you can just play them a million times.
[384:33.57]You just ignored a wave of something in the chat.
[384:38.02]I don't know what it was.
[384:41.95]The fuck?
[384:42.47]People saying, like, the fuck?
[384:44.19]Like, what, the fuck two?
[384:48.17]Like, times, like, plus two, minus two?
[384:49.99]I don't know.
[385:00.49]I don't know.
[385:00.87]Whatever that is.
[385:01.51]I think it seems like it might be fun.
[385:07.23]But, thank you, Freudian, for the five dollars.
[385:10.15]I guess when you see somebody just doing anything, you kind of remember the time that you also did it, and then maybe you weren't even thinking about Hearthstone today, and I just happened to put it in your brain.
[385:22.04]And then you're like, yeah, why not?
[385:23.66]Happens to me all the time.
[385:26.20]Thank you, Trampston, for the $5.
[385:28.01]Game sucks.
[385:28.77]I'm going to bed.
[385:29.89]Have a good night.
[385:30.43]I hope you have a good rest.
[385:33.24]Thank you for the $5.
[385:33.90]Freudian Weapon, thanks for $2.50.
[385:38.02]By the way, can't wait for Cooking Simulator, neither can I. I've been waiting a long time for it.
[385:43.88]I am very, very excited for tomorrow.
[385:48.93]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[385:50.41]Imagine being a Hearthstone stream watcher, clicking the most watched Hearthstone stream, and seeing the TF2 Shpee guy from four years ago getting his ass kicked constantly.
[386:04.43]Hold on.
[386:05.25]First of all, you make that sound like... Like... The TF2 Shmee guy.
[386:11.89]You know, I made more than one video.
[386:17.55]Oh, hey.
[386:17.99]Oh, that's the TF2 Shmee guy.
[386:19.95]I have like a thousand uploads.
[386:33.18]You are the TF2 shpee guy, but no, that's not what I am.
[386:39.88]I'm so many other things.
[386:42.90]I'm so many, I'm so much more than that.
[386:47.24]I'm gonna, oh yeah, I'm gonna go delete them.
[386:49.16]It's time to delete those videos, yeah.
[386:55.59]But yes, thank you for the two, that was so funny.
[387:01.10]I hope people save those screenshots, because that'll get a good laugh out of me in the future when I forget about it.
[387:10.73]Podcast listener, thanks for $10.
[387:12.29]Back at it again with the Bits boys.
[387:15.63]Dermajacks.
[387:17.31]There were a lot of them tonight.
[387:19.17]Highly appreciate it, you guys.
[387:23.36]Hand over huge amounts of money, and I fucking graciously accept.
[387:29.16]Thank you.
[387:32.86]uh also and then a couple hours ago it was a hundred dollars from flutters we touched upon it but flutter's been around for a long fucking time more than six years so thanks for being around glad you still think it's interesting enough to watch and be a part of uh invader z thanks for the 250 hey germa have you ever played magic the gathering
[388:01.77]I've been playing Commander a lot recently with friends and was wondering if you played it since you're playing Hearthstone, which is similar.
[388:07.37]I think I touched upon it a little bit, but just in case you weren't here when I did.
[388:12.59]I'm not really that into card games.
[388:16.25]I don't really play a lot of card games.
[388:20.05]Hearthstone is just very easy to just do random stuff and have fun and open up minions and have random acts and
[388:31.13]I... I don't know if I would be able to get into magic.
[388:43.16]Lives in Vegas doesn't like cards.
[388:44.80]No, that's a different kind of card.
[388:49.00]mtg is definitely more involved yeah and I mean obviously hearthstone stream us hanging out and me dicking around and going three and three and like oh and three and like losing on heroic and just hanging out that's fine and it's it's fun and I've obviously I'm I don't think I want to do that with like magic the gathering because I'm not sure if there's any opportunities to do that
[389:11.96]Can you just, like, open up a game of Magic the Gathering and just, like, not know every card and try and get destroyed?
[389:18.88]Would that be as interesting as Hearthstone?
[389:24.47]Because I don't know anything about Magic the Gathering.
[389:27.33]Zero.
[389:33.49]Magic the Gathering might give you a heart attack.
[389:36.87]But probably not.
[389:40.76]You need to be really good at to have much fun with.
[389:43.72]Yeah, and Hearthstone is right at that kind of layer of casual and fun, but still has like a good skill ceiling in it in various ways.
[389:54.81]There's still a meta in the game.
[389:56.61]There's lots of things you need to know, but not like magic.
[390:01.84]Magic has a lot more going on that I wouldn't even be able to comprehend for a second.
[390:10.44]But probably not.
[390:13.24]And I still got destroyed in Hearthstone.
[390:14.52]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[390:15.24]That's kind of what I'm saying.
[390:21.43]Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[390:22.31]I'm sorry, Dad.
[390:23.21]We love you.
[390:23.67]Jerma Pluto.
[390:25.15]Don't be sorry, son.
[390:27.15]You're a good boy.
[390:30.23]You're just such a smart young lad.
[390:32.07]Thank you.
[390:40.61]M. Weldo, thanks for the three dollars.
[390:42.21]Think we all know what happened on that phone call yesterday.
[390:44.60]Keep up the funny bits.
[390:46.94]What happened on the phone call yesterday?
[390:48.88]Alright, we'll put my agent on the line then.
[390:53.36]I don't know why... Is this doctor disrespect?
[390:55.85]Why do I have to go... Yeah.

[392:20.23]Yeah.

[393:27.37]That was funny.
[393:32.81]That was M. Weldo, thanks for the three bucks.
[393:39.13]And thanks for the video.
[393:42.01]And what do you say we get the credits on the screen?
[393:45.44]This is going to be pretty wild.
[393:50.26]You ready?
[393:50.58]Here are all the subs from this stream.
[394:03.22]There's a rumor right there.
[394:08.86]Jesus.
[394:13.48]It had to have been at least a few, like more than a few hundred.
[394:20.71]Opening Hearthstone card packs.
[394:29.42]It's going so fast that it's lagging the plugin.
[394:37.25]I'm dropping frames.
[394:39.00]My frame rate is being dropped here.
[394:42.86]But thank you all of you.
[394:43.68]Thank you to all the community subs.
[394:46.60]There was a shitload during that first 30-40 minutes.
[394:50.97]You guys are too kind.
[394:51.73]Thank you.
[394:58.19]What do I say in the phone?
[394:59.26]Somebody's screaming, put the phone down.
[395:05.99]Well, it's me screaming it, but... Thank you to all of you.
[395:14.89]We do have two more bits that came in.
[395:16.31]We have Spooge for $3.
[395:18.93]Hey, Jermo, still nine months sub.
[395:20.95]Where's the baby?
[395:22.43]Also, what are some games you're looking forward to seeing at E3?
[395:24.57]I know you had a rough time with Mount & Blade, but... Was that 2019?
[395:32.26]It was, wasn't it?
[395:34.84]Okay.
[395:36.35]Yeah, we have a candidate.
[395:37.67]Yeah, we have a candidate.
[395:44.50]Yeah, well.
[395:46.60]But, uh, give multiplayer a chance because that's where it really shines and keeps an eye out for its sequel, or keep an eye out for its sequel, Bannerlord, if it ever comes out.
[396:00.67]I can't, this is still going this fast.
[396:05.80]Yeah, this Mods Fort 2... I just got so soured on it because I just... It was... I don't know.
[396:13.68]It was half of me trying to figure out what to do and the other half of trying to... You know, having people tell me things and what to do and where to go and... It's kind of a perfect storm of things that... There's a lot of systems in that game that you have to pay attention to.
[396:36.23]Bannerlord 2040, yeah.
[396:39.63]Something like that.
[396:45.29]Almu said, I have surgery coming up and they're going to put me under.
[396:48.08]It's my first time so I'm going to get some support.
[396:54.86]Yeah, hopefully it goes well.
[396:56.98]Hopefully your surgery goes well.
[397:00.37]Anesthesia is a lot scarier the way that it seems rather than the way that it is.
[397:08.38]So don't worry about that.
[397:11.94]When I was put under, it was really comfortable.
[397:15.93]I just kind of fell right asleep.
[397:19.65]You don't really even know.
[397:24.42]You're just lying there wherever you are.
[397:28.40]And somebody's like, okay, hey, you comfortable?
[397:31.22]You good?
[397:31.48]And it's like, yeah, I'm all right.
[397:32.54]I'm okay.
[397:34.10]And they, you know, slowly give it to you.
[397:36.75]And you, it just kind of, not in like a weird, scary way or anything, but you just kind of, almost like you just kind of wake up.
[397:48.59]You just wake up.
[397:52.14]It's strange, because you'll feel, you'll have the, if you have an anesthesia and an IV, you just start to drift a second, and one, two, you're awake in the recovery room.
[398:10.66]So, that's kind of the way that it's happened to me the last one or two times that I've had it.
[398:16.40]You'll get some food, if you can eat, depending on what you have in for surgery.
[398:22.92]But it's a lot, um, and they all know this, these people are pros, right?
[398:30.42]They know that people are nervous, they know that, you know, it's kind of stressful.
[398:34.65]Got like five people, when I had my colonoscopy this past week, it was, you know, there's like four or five people in the room, all have masks on, like, okay, I'm gonna come over here, and it's just like, oh, okay, all right, all right, how are we doing?
[398:49.26]But they're all... They want to take really good care of you.
[398:52.57]They care about it.
[398:57.99]Then... Most surgeons, most doctors, and most anesthesiologists, they've been doing it for a long time.
[399:03.07]They know exactly what to do.
[399:12.37]So I wouldn't worry about it at all.
[399:15.73]You're going to get up, and you're not even going to realize it happened.
[399:24.31]But I wish you luck.
[399:28.21]All the love and support to you for real.
[399:33.90]And let us know how it goes.
