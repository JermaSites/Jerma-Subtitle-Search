[00:00.92]Hello.
[00:03.34]How's everybody doing?
[00:06.58]Hope you're having a good day.
[00:07.90]I'm having a pretty good day.
[00:12.36]I'm a little sloppy right now.
[00:14.84]That's because I just got out of an MRI.
[00:20.19]And those are always fun.
[00:22.13]And this time I had to get contrast.
[00:25.15]They put an IV in and they pump you full of fucking squid ink or whatever the hell it is.
[00:30.44]And then they get a good image.
[00:35.13]I'm a little sloppy right now.
[00:36.35]That's why we're late.
[00:37.13]That's why we didn't stream today.
[00:39.43]Yesterday, the day before, actually, Otto had a surgical procedure done to... It's been all over the place.
[00:47.69]And I got a lot of stuff going on the next few days, too.
[00:51.49]A lot of things going on.
[00:56.16]I'm glad I did that 13-hour Lord of the Rings fuckface stream.
[01:01.32]Because... Yeah, that was like three streams.
[01:07.39]Thankfully.
[01:08.27]Because then that... The next few days, obviously, I wasn't around.
[01:11.33]And then juggling streams the rest of this week.
[01:14.69]Is Otto okay?
[01:15.25]Otto is fine, completely.
[01:21.08]But he had to have surgery.
[01:22.58]And then I had to have an MRI.
[01:24.84]So...
[01:26.45]And then there's all kinds of IRL stuff that I don't... I'm not really gonna talk about because they don't need to be talked about.
[01:31.01]Yeah, we're gonna just chill out today.
[01:34.53]I wasn't sure if I was gonna... Here comes the hype train!
[01:47.90]Oh my god.
[01:51.38]Colonoscopy 2.
[01:53.82]I probably sound fucked up a little bit because...
[01:57.13]Stuff just messes with me.
[01:59.23]Well, I like mom my mouth tastes weird.
[02:01.17]I like fingers were like cold Well, I Have an MRI fear if you didn't know while the hype train continues to throw hundreds and hundreds of dollars at this stream
[02:17.24]Every time I go to an MRI machine, I always think... I've had three MRIs, I think, in my whole life.
[02:22.32]And when I go do them, I always have this weird panic.
[02:25.64]Where I go... Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[02:27.10]There could be metal in me.
[02:30.42]There might be metal inside my body.
[02:31.80]I don't know.
[02:32.08]I need to think of every single time I've ever had... Wait, what about metal, like, in your eye?
[02:38.33]Have I ever had metal shavings in my eye?
[02:40.35]Have I ever been... Have I ever been a welder?
[02:42.43]I don't know.
[02:44.33]No, I don't think so.
[02:46.56]What about my teeth?
[02:47.30]Do my teeth have any metal in them?
[02:48.66]If I ever had a... Is my teeth gonna rip out?
[02:51.25]Because I've had a filling?
[02:54.37]And then when you're in the machine, that like... You can feel your hairs kind of standing up.
[03:02.59]And I'm like, is this teeth?
[03:04.33]Is this when the teeth come out?
[03:05.61]Because I can feel it.
[03:10.65]The magnets just running around you.
[03:12.21]It's a shitty experience.
[03:18.27]But yeah, I have this weird irrational fear that... Wait, hold on.
[03:21.89]Check my pockets again.
[03:23.39]Do I have... What about the rings?
[03:25.35]Where the loops... You know your pants?
[03:28.00]The thing you tie your pants with?
[03:29.80]Not a belt.
[03:30.72]If you have jogging pants on.
[03:32.08]That little belt pant loop thing.
[03:35.04]There's a little metal ring.
[03:36.46]No, no, not a belt.
[03:38.92]The thing... When you wear jogging pants.
[03:42.66]Drawstring.
[03:43.18]There it is.
[03:43.58]No, not a belt.
[03:44.02]Yeah, drawstring.
[03:44.78]I know this word.
[03:48.64]With the drawstrings connect to go through the pants to actually go around your body It's like a little metal ring here And it's like am I gonna get sucked up to the top of the machine like a cartoon?
[04:01.49]And then obviously the answer is no we're already on level 4 the hype train which is fucking ridiculous Now obviously I don't know these things I don't think these things are actually gonna happen
[04:19.57]But the teeth thing does freak me out a little.
[04:25.76]Are we just doing a relaxing stream?
[04:27.00]Yes, we are.
[04:29.24]We're just going to hang out.
[04:30.28]We're going to chill.
[04:30.82]We're going to play this game.
[04:32.12]Sorry if my voice sounds a little strange.
[04:34.92]It's a little raspy.
[04:38.54]I don't know why.
[04:39.71]I think it's just kind of... My body might be a little stressed.
[04:42.01]I don't know.
[04:45.09]But thank you, everybody, for the third hype train in a row.
[04:50.05]Third time.
[04:52.41]You guys are fucking ridiculous.
[04:59.00]Please don't... Please don't die.
[05:01.22]I don't plan on it.
[05:03.38]I don't have a plan.
[05:04.14]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[05:05.26]I don't plan on that, but... I don't know.
[05:08.06]I could... I don't know.
[05:10.73]I don't know.
[05:11.55]Nobody plans on it.
[05:13.21]Don't say that.
[05:14.11]Hype train complete.
[05:15.63]We just completed the hype train.
[05:18.32]Thanks a lot, guys.
[05:19.70]I've trained.
[05:21.72]Level 4.
[05:21.90]The game we're going to play is King's Way.
[05:25.46]It's a medieval OS.
[05:29.81]And yes, you heard that right.
[05:31.13]Somebody said it's like Hypnospace Outlaw.
[05:34.07]But it's an RPG.
[05:36.49]So, it's going to be something we can just relax with and play.
[05:39.03]And then tomorrow... Tomorrow is going to be an early, early stream.
[05:45.83]We're going to do an EU stream tomorrow, and it's probably going to be Rhythm Heaven.
[05:50.48]Somewhere around 11 to 12 Pacific AM is tomorrow's stream.
[05:58.92]I was thinking about doing Rhythm Heaven tonight, but I just am not.
[06:01.22]I can't.
[06:02.96]I can't.
[06:03.40]I got, like, this thing wrapped around my arm because of the IV, and, like, I'm just... I feel, like, kind of shitty.
[06:08.58]So I'd rather not wave my arms around and sing songs and shit.
[06:13.27]But we'll do that tomorrow.
[06:13.87]That sounds like a plan tomorrow.
[06:15.43]EU stream tomorrow.
[06:18.81]But without further ado, as Pipetrain continues to leave the station.
[06:28.08]Let's get over here.
[06:28.76]He's feeling a little shitty.
[06:32.38]I mean, a little.
[06:34.28]A little.
[06:35.55]Just like tired and, I don't know, annoyed.
[06:37.83]You know what I'm talking about?
[06:40.08]Anytime you go to the doctor is a day that you're going to be annoyed.
[06:41.94]It doesn't matter.
[06:43.28]You can feel fantastic before going in.
[06:45.36]You're just going to be annoyed afterwards.
[06:50.63]And here we go.
[06:52.47]So again, this is a operating system.
[06:55.75]A medieval operating system.
[07:00.59]Did I dip on Joel twice?
[07:02.34]Joel hasn't said anything to me.
[07:06.28]Guys, me and Joel don't talk unless, like, a stream is currently on.
[07:11.90]That's, like, kind of how it works the last, like, three weeks.
[07:15.06]Like, if one of our streams is turned on, then, like, oh, then, oh, hey, Joel!
[07:19.78]Hey!
[07:20.10]Oh, Jay Jerva!
[07:20.78]What's up, man?
[07:25.16]Our last conversation on Discord was, like, let's see.
[07:31.12]Yeah, last Sunday.
[07:32.04]Okay.
[07:34.01]Yo man, you still want to take a day off?
[07:36.27]I heard you stream for like 12 hours.
[07:39.71]See, he's looking out for me.
[07:41.40]He's looking out for me.
[07:47.98]Actually, hey, the only time that me and Joel talk is when the stream's live, so let's reply.
[07:53.58]Ready?
[07:53.72]How about this one?
[07:55.44]Hey, dude.
[07:56.96]And then in brackets, yo, stream's on.
[07:59.02]What do you mean?
[08:00.66]Like he's going to say something?
[08:02.86]Hey, dude, stream's on.
[08:04.68]Hey, dude, stream's on.
[08:12.93]Don't say your credit card number out loud.
[08:16.45]Alright, I'm going to say, hey, dude, I'm around for this weekend.
[08:24.91]EU, if you could believe it.
[08:26.97]And I'm going to write that.
[08:28.07]EU, if you could believe it.
[08:32.23]What say you on a return to keep talking?
[08:41.20]Why am I saying it like this?
[08:42.32]Alright, I sent it.
[08:47.98]Message sent.
[08:48.54]Let's see what we get back for an email later.
[08:55.57]My dearest Joel, I must ask you.
[09:00.19]Okay, new adventure of the slide.
[09:01.59]Remember, this is an operating system.
[09:05.19]Let's go to make sure everything's correct.
[09:07.09]No, no settings.
[09:09.37]Do I want to curse a trail?
[09:11.88]Every time I ever had this on the old windows, it just it was like a drug simulation.
[09:16.72]I just feel like I feel like this is not I don't like this.
[09:19.08]I'm on drugs.
[09:20.94]I don't like that.
[09:22.86]You would have I'm on drugs or my computer sucks.
[09:28.98]Alright, this is I'm on drugs or integrated graphics card.
[09:34.88]I don't, all of these are bad.
[09:37.40]We're going with this.
[09:39.75]I'm not doing the drugs, no.
[09:44.07]What about background?
[09:44.87]Did he do it?
[09:50.66]Level 5 Hype Train has been completed.

[10:31.27]No, actually pink is okay.
[10:34.35]Did you do Windows 3.1?
[10:42.29]Purple, purple, purple, purple, purple.
[10:45.93]No, I don't like that either.
[10:50.87]I like this one.
[10:51.87]No, this one's nighttime.
[10:53.31]It's time for sleep time.
[10:54.23]No, the default's okay.
[10:55.77]Dark?
[10:59.89]I don't like the dark theme.
[11:00.83]Alright, this one's fine.
[11:05.35]No, this is more chill.
[11:06.61]I'll take it.
[11:07.83]Notifications.
[11:09.51]Sure.
[11:10.44]Sound.

[12:30.78]Well-rounded character, not great at anything, not bad at anything, right?
[12:33.57]Makes sense.
[12:34.05]Warrior.
[12:34.51]A strong character, skilled with heavy weapons and armor.
[12:38.59]Wise character, focused on magic and light armor.
[12:41.75]Agile, master of many... So do you... This is like, you play this game in the operating system.
[12:47.17]It's weird.
[12:49.15]Or beast skin.
[12:50.17]An odd character, strong and tough, but has a bad reputation.
[12:56.95]I like mage.
[12:58.50]I'm a mage.
[13:00.60]Edit the portrait.
[13:03.36]Okay, eyes.
[13:03.68]Does it look like me?
[13:04.38]Nah, it's bigger than that.
[13:15.39]Meh.
[13:19.17]Let's see.
[13:22.93]Okay.
[13:28.90]Bowl cut.
[13:31.18]That looks alright.
[13:34.04]I don't have an old face, do I?
[13:36.96]Should I do the mustache?
[13:41.22]Head shape?
[13:45.75]I'm just making that one image that was made of me with the mustache.
[13:51.44]What the fuck?
[13:54.42]Okay.
[13:55.34]I actually like it.
[13:57.10]Hold on, let me see the other hairstyles.
[14:08.31]I like this.
[14:11.31]I like that one too.
[14:12.71]These are all good.
[14:14.67]All of these are good.
[14:22.19]No, not bald.
[14:23.17]That's too easy.
[14:28.75]That's too easy, though.
[14:29.85]It really is.
[14:30.41]How can you have different hair color when you have a bald head?
[14:37.46]Okay, but better eyebrows?
[14:40.92]Do we have the concerned eyebrows?
[14:42.40]Okay.
[14:44.78]Eyebrows and beard.
[14:48.30]What about ears?
[14:48.86]That's fine.
[14:55.40]What is custom?
[14:56.77]Oh, you can import images.
[14:59.89]What?
[15:01.23]I don't have any custom images.
[15:03.17]48x48?
[15:07.97]Do I have one of those?
[15:11.36]What do we do?
[15:11.98]Do it.
[15:12.56]Import.
[15:13.12]How do you already have this?
[15:17.32]That's not a 48x48 image.
[15:21.61]Yes, we do.
[15:22.17]We do.
[15:22.41]Does somebody have a 48x48 picture of my face?
[15:29.07]That's a number I've never heard before.
[15:30.39]Just draw one right now.
[15:31.45]One of your emotes.
[15:32.20]Well, the emotes are 50.
[15:34.66]They're not 48 by 48.
[15:36.70]Resize an emote.
[15:38.58]Open Photoshop.
[15:39.34]I don't want to open an Adobe program.
[15:42.52]Don't you know, if you double click an Adobe program, you're going to be sitting there for four minutes while it opens.
[15:46.68]I don't have that kind of time.
[15:53.29]Just do it in paint.
[15:53.97]Alright, hold on.
[15:55.23]What should I use?
[16:00.15]Every time I open up an Adobe program, I feel like I'm working at NASA.
[16:04.52]And it's like, well, booting up the supercomputer.
[16:07.30]Why do you have to tell me everything you're loading?
[16:09.16]I don't care.
[16:09.66]Just load.
[16:12.70]Adobe products have a loading screen that cycles through a million different text files.
[16:17.85]Like loading this.
[16:18.45]It's like, I don't need that information.
[16:22.59]Just open it.
[16:24.85]Wait, you have one already?
[16:26.11]In the time that it took me to talk about Adobe?
[16:29.09]Is that 48 by 48?
[16:32.37]Okay, fine.
[16:34.62]This doesn't even matter.
[16:35.56]I don't think this matters.
[16:41.38]Well, fine.
[16:43.56]Where is it?
[16:43.90]Where'd it go?
[16:44.22]Right there?
[16:44.78]Okay.
[16:47.29]I need to... Hold on.
[16:51.37]Custom import.
[16:58.68]Why does it- It doesn't think this is an image.
[17:04.22]How is this not an image?
[17:07.99]Plea- No, we're not just gonna- We're not just gonna give a- I can't.
[17:14.11]Okay, fine.
[17:16.03]Fine.
[17:16.95]Fine.
[17:19.37]That one is pretty- Is that 48 by 48?
[17:20.69]Alright, okay.
[17:29.62]okay it works it works it works what's this character wait I can change the hair color I can't believe this is actually a real image
[17:55.94]Okay, when somebody first showed me this, the first thing, I read the comments.
[18:01.19]You don't think I'd read comments?
[18:02.49]I sit there in my bed and I like bite my fingernails and I go, what the fuck are people saying?
[18:06.76]Somebody said I look like a default GoldenEye enemy.
[18:10.76]Or like a Nintendo 64 NPC or something.
[18:16.36]And I was like, ah, I guess, yeah, that's true.
[18:18.94]That is pretty true.
[18:19.72]Alright, Alvin 5000.
[18:22.06]Mage.
[18:23.93]Everyone gets the same world.
[18:25.01]I don't want to do leaderboard.
[18:25.95]Alright, I'm pretty intelligent.
[18:28.61]This is accurate.
[18:32.39]Choose a starting gift.
[18:33.49]Plus 6 health points, 2 magic points, or 20 gold.
[18:38.21]What's more important?
[18:41.69]I don't know.
[18:41.99]20 gold?
[18:46.83]Whoa, that was loud!
[18:50.21]Health, 21 out of 20.
[18:52.07]Double click the world navigator to travel through the land of Kingsway.
[18:56.59]Okay.
[19:00.87]What?
[19:01.49]The yellow circles on the map are map nodes.
[19:05.09]Click a node to travel to its location or inspect it for more information.
[19:13.04]inspect training room distance 112 location boat okay this is there is a battle dummy some locations have events that trigger when you arrive you must deal with the event before you can continue traveling okay uh attack
[19:41.22]In a battle, you can choose an available skill.
[19:43.62]Each skill has a special use.
[19:46.06]And some are faster than others.
[19:47.84]Press the skill to attack your target.
[19:50.60]Is it loaded?
[19:55.33]Alvin 5000 attacks for 1 damage.
[20:01.53]There's a defense too?
[20:02.89]That's the load too, I assume.

[20:09.04]You got plus 5 experience.
[20:10.20]What about loot?
[20:12.14]Oh, nothing.
[20:12.68]This is cool.
[20:14.70]I like that you can actually move them, too.
[20:16.37]Am I going to get overwhelmed eventually?
[20:17.85]Alright, cool.
[20:21.69]Continue.
[20:24.07]You will encounter battle... You will encounter... Oh, this is fucking contrast, man.

[28:45.11]What do I have to do with this?
[28:46.53]The old stories tell shifting...
[28:49.47]The old stories tell of the shifting land when one day the sun won't rise, but instead an eternal being will travel over the land.
[28:55.91]Closing the sky with its unthinkable size, its footprints distort the ground.
[28:59.02]Those who survived were very few of them, by the way, will no longer recognize the land and history will begin anew.
[29:05.65]Alright.
[29:06.51]Don't skip lore.
[29:06.91]I didn't.
[29:07.09]I just did it.

[29:49.95]5G contrast.
[29:53.60]It doesn't work like that.
[29:54.66]I know, I'm just being stupid.
[29:56.80]Should I heal?
[29:57.66]I'm kind of scared to go over here.
[30:01.30]Don't I have to- would I have to bring this?
[30:04.00]Should I go to the king's castle?
[30:07.89]I'm scared.
[30:10.97]You come across a derelict house.
[30:15.51]Do you enter?
[30:16.85]Okay.
[30:19.97]You stand at the entrance of the derelict house.
[30:21.87]There are several rooms.
[30:22.73]Where do you go?
[30:27.22]Nursery.
[30:28.44]You enter the nursery.
[30:29.10]Everything's covered in dust.
[30:31.10]Library.
[30:32.80]You enter the library.
[30:33.48]It looks like it's been unused for a while.
[30:35.14]There's a locked chest.
[30:37.39]Is that a key?
[30:39.01]No.
[30:40.15]You need a key.
[30:41.91]Check the bookcases.
[30:42.83]Ooh, book of burn.
[30:48.13]Permanently learned skill burn.
[30:54.45]Learned skill burn.
[30:57.53]Oh, that's right.
[30:58.24]I'm a magician.
[30:59.44]That's why I was getting my ass kicked.
[31:00.90]I don't have any spells.
[31:05.28]Oh, cool.
[31:05.56]Alright.
[31:06.28]What about the hall?
[31:08.29]Uh-oh, okay, burn!
[31:09.63]Okay, that's how you do it.
[31:16.11]Oh, that's cool, alright.
[31:16.81]Wait, you can be good or bad?
[31:38.50]Broken sword.
[31:39.42]Dirty shirt.
[31:41.72]What should I do?
[31:43.78]There's attack speed.
[31:47.38]Maximum magic points.
[31:49.11]Maximum health.
[31:51.69]Damage with melee.
[31:52.53]Look at my... My health is terrible.
[31:56.47]Oh, do I have three?
[31:57.29]I'm gonna do double health and then one intellect.
[31:59.77]That sounds good.
[32:00.69]But it was skills.
[32:01.29]Okay, I got burned.
[32:04.10]We can upgrade the skill?
[32:07.53]Alright, poison.
[32:08.57]Chill.
[32:10.34]Four cold damage and slows target poison.
[32:12.34]Inflicts eight poison.
[32:13.50]Critical focus.
[32:17.08]Vigilance.
[32:18.52]At the start of every battle, your first attack is 40% faster.
[32:21.28]What do I get for upgrading burn?
[32:26.60]Five fire damage.
[32:28.26]And it costs three.
[32:29.96]Should I just have a super burn?
[32:31.74]Heal.
[32:35.24]Oh, that's pretty good.
[32:36.84]I got it.
[32:37.18]Okay, heal.
[32:39.10]Nice.
[32:39.34]Alright, what does it look like?
[32:40.22]Heal.
[32:41.26]Burn.
[32:42.04]Lock.
[32:42.76]Escape.
[32:45.49]I could have just had a super burn right there.
[32:47.15]Did I waste it?
[32:50.07]Um, I'm alright.
[32:52.89]Okay, close all these windows.
[32:56.87]I'll keep that open.
[32:59.57]Beast eye.
[33:00.03]Can these stack?
[33:01.48]No, they can't.
[33:04.96]Alright, leave and continue.
[33:07.18]Rest in the bed.
[33:09.90]I like this.
[33:10.48]This is kind of fun.
[33:11.22]This is exactly what I needed.
[33:13.68]Can I see a bigger window?
[33:24.01]Alright, should I go across or should I clear this whole place up?
[33:34.43]Resize the window.
[33:35.41]I don't think I can.
[33:39.89]Is this another outpost?
[33:42.81]I'm gonna clear this.
[33:49.12]Clear the whole tutorial island.
[33:50.92]That's fine.
[33:51.88]Skeleton!
[33:52.40]Skeleton!
[33:52.86]Skeleton!

[34:41.71]I have that, don't I?
[34:45.34]Let's talk.
[34:46.18]Talk rumors.
[34:49.12]Have you heard of the Foundation?
[34:50.82]They stay in the mountains summoning demons.
[34:53.96]But why?
[34:54.48]Demons are so dangerous.
[34:56.86]They must be planning something.
[34:59.84]I have another question for you.
[35:05.94]Did he just run?
[35:06.56]Alright, let's put this on.
[35:12.76]Oh, it requires level 3.

[58:36.56]You are approached by an old, scraggly, witch-like figure.
[58:39.79]Punched over wearing a hood and walking with a large staff, the witch comes right up to you.
[58:46.11]Uh... The witch looks at you up and down and says, I can help with your little adventure if you're interested.
[58:53.39]What was that accent?

[59:03.94]I feel like I'm gonna get, uh, cursed or something.
[59:07.60]Interested.
[59:08.76]You can just barely see a smile beneath the hood.
[59:11.36]That first one is free.
[59:14.28]The witch is stabbed against a shake and there's a flash of light.
[59:16.74]The witch is gone.
[59:18.76]You feel a change in yourself.
[59:21.38]Health regeneration permanently increased.
[59:26.41]So that was a good thing.
[59:28.87]Alright.
[59:32.00]Alright, there's something called electric skin.
[59:36.66]Uh, I don't care what anything else exists in the whole game.
[59:40.25]I don't care.
[59:41.65]I'm going to max out electric skin.
[59:43.23]I'm going to put every single point in electric skin.
[59:50.30]That's just what's happening.
[59:51.42]I'm sorry. ...
[60:02.99]It's just on.

[60:13.14]Passive.
[60:15.58]Alright.
[60:16.60]Um... Attack speed... Maybe I should do attack speed.
[60:27.29]Or should I just dump it into vitality?
[60:44.98]I'm playing it safe.
[60:47.28]Safe.
[60:50.62]I have to play it safe.
[60:52.34]What did I get there?
[60:53.25]What does Living Seed do?
[60:54.19]Alright, Living Seed.
[60:56.03]Someone may want this.
[61:00.03]Antidote.
[61:00.35]That's for poison, I'm assuming.
[61:02.09]What is that?
[61:02.55]Don't I have a map somewhere?
[61:05.32]What's the mission I have right now?
[61:08.62]Skeletons.

[61:18.64]That's the skeletons.
[61:19.16]Alright, let's go.
[61:19.76]I'm going up this way.
[61:27.46]This is a long way.
[61:31.93]Didn't even get a chance to do a goddamn thing.
[61:38.93]Dead.
[61:40.11]Abandoned hubble.
[61:40.55]I got two keys.
[61:41.13]Let's go in.
[61:43.23]Oh, storm.
[61:43.81]Oh, shit.
[61:49.24]How many skulls do I have now?
[61:52.02]I think I need four skulls, right?
[61:56.28]Uh, side room.
[61:57.06]Okay, let's unlock the chest.
[62:03.49]Mighty leather armor.
[62:07.49]I wonder if it's worth putting points into strength just to wear the leather armor.
[62:10.29]It probably is.
[62:13.11]One act.
[62:18.19]I don't know.
[62:21.23]It is absolutely not worth it, though.
[62:22.95]But it might be.
[62:23.95]Nothing in the kitchen.
[62:30.67]Sleep in the bed.
[62:33.89]Not for this build.
[62:35.15]Yeah, that's true.
[62:38.21]Alright.
[62:39.41]Do I go?
[62:40.19]I'm not doing that yet.
[62:41.99]Rather narrow.
[62:50.83]Go to the town.
[62:51.33]Okay, this is called Vesterith.
[62:56.12]Oh.
[62:56.68]Wait, this is a dungeon.
[62:58.96]This is a dungeon.
[62:59.74]I don't think I'm ready for this.
[63:00.52]Can I leave?
[63:01.44]How do I leave?
[63:01.88]Can I leave?
[63:04.72]What happens if I X out of the window?
[63:06.60]Can I X the window?
[63:08.16]Okay.
[63:23.17]Shit, I'm gonna fucking die down here.
[63:30.62]There's a strange figure on your path that is carrying a small bag overflowing with shiny objects.
[63:36.68]The figure is very focused, investigating every crevice of a nearby wall.
[63:44.52]For the closer look, you can see that the strange figure is some sort of demon-like creature.
[63:49.80]It notices you and tries to hide behind his bag.
[63:58.86]I'll let you look at my items if you promise not to hurt me.
[64:03.36]And by the way, everybody in a medieval game is Irish.
[64:08.02]All of us.
[64:08.64]It doesn't matter if we're a demon, an old lady, a man at the inn, a bartender, or the king.
[64:15.00]Every single one of us is fucking Irish.
[64:17.55]Always.
[64:17.89]Okay, let me see.
[64:23.37]The demon thanks you.
[64:25.78]Am I going to get sucked into the bag?
[64:36.08]The man with two voices.
[64:39.59]That's me.
[64:43.91]Okay, if I look at the bag, he's going to capture me.
[64:46.29]I'm going to get... I'm going to get grabbed.
[64:52.13]Right?
[64:53.38]I'm going to get grabbed.
[64:54.70]This is going to...
[64:56.57]Holy shit.
[64:59.03]Holy shit.
[64:59.65]How much money do I have?
[65:05.27]14 gold.
[65:06.23]No.
[65:07.51]Look at all this stuff.
[65:08.49]Can I sell?
[65:15.50]No, I can't sell to him.
[65:19.68]Damn it.
[65:20.58]This is so sad.
[65:28.82]I didn't know it was gonna be 50 gold.
[65:37.90]Come on, don't get anything.
[65:38.90]No random.
[65:40.06]Ooh, look at that.

[69:27.33]Alright.
[69:32.21]1 vitality.
[69:34.37]with the escape chance, which who cares, versus three strength and magic find.
[69:40.37]Probably there's a strength ring.
[69:49.79]Yeah.
[69:54.35]I'm not going to sell this yet, though.
[69:55.81]We'll see how this works.
[69:56.47]Okay.
[69:59.52]Look at this axe.
[70:03.45]Minus 15% damage to demons plus 20% damage to bosses.
[70:06.87]I could kill bosses if I was a warrior or something.
[70:10.11]Strength is useless if you're a mage.
[70:13.86]Yeah, but I do find myself using the regular swing sometimes.
[70:16.96]At least initially here in the early game.
[70:19.46]Drop shield.
[70:21.28]I could sell this.
[70:21.92]I'm not going to drop it.
[70:22.70]I could sell it.
[70:23.14]Okay.
[70:34.92]Fuck.
[70:35.12]How much does it weigh?
[70:38.98]Drop the small shield.
[70:43.46]How much does it... I can sell this.
[70:54.72]It's one gold?
[70:55.98]Oh.
[70:56.72]Alright, well, whatever.
[70:59.20]Nice.
[70:59.53]Okay, I'm ready.
[71:01.43]I can't wear this.
[71:02.27]Wait, maybe I can?
[71:03.91]Ahhhh.
[71:05.69]Because I had the strength ring on.
[71:06.55]Alright, let's go.
[71:08.82]Uh, this is a bad idea.
[71:10.22]So I'm gonna leave.
[71:20.82]Fuck.
[71:22.44]Fuck.
[71:22.66]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[71:31.50]I just need to leave.
[71:34.51]I just need to get out.
[71:38.43]What is this person?
[71:42.81]No, I don't need to escape.
[71:43.73]I look how close I am to a level.
[71:47.94]Is it a raid coming?
[71:48.74]Gmart came in with a huge raid.
[71:51.22]Hey.
[71:52.12]What's up, Gmart?
[71:54.30]See, I see it this time.
[71:55.24]Last time, I didn't see it.
[71:56.16]I swear to God.
[72:04.09]Welcome, everybody.
[72:06.36]We're playing, uh, King's Way.
[72:08.86]It is a... I'm gonna die.
[72:16.83]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[72:18.81]My health is critically low.
[72:19.69]I have to kill him right now.
[72:21.49]Go.
[72:22.83]Die!
[72:24.61]Oh!
[72:29.03]I died.
[72:30.49]I died, but I instantly leveled up.
[72:32.86]It heals me.
[72:33.94]Holy shit, that was bad.
[72:39.10]wow okay attack speed um well let me just hold on just a second what I know okay skill electric skin too
[73:10.41]Burn three?
[73:14.54]Follower only is on?
[73:15.70]Ah, shit.
[73:16.88]Ah, turn off follower only for a minute.
[73:20.44]What about greater here?
[73:23.33]Wait a minute.
[73:25.95]Hmm.
[73:31.79]But whatever you were doing, Gmart, I hope you guys had fun.
[73:35.59]We're just chilling.
[73:37.35]It was a chill stream today.
[73:38.53]I was at the doctor today.
[73:40.81]I had an MRI done.
[73:43.19]With contrast.
[73:44.77]So, fuck.
[73:46.11]No, that sucked.
[73:51.44]What should I do?
[73:51.94]I think I'm just going to upgrade heal too.
[74:00.05]That's 26 health.
[74:01.63]For what?
[74:01.97]4 mana?
[74:02.51]5 mana?
[74:05.97]Why did I do that?
[74:07.54]Why did I just click that?
[74:08.52]I just clicked that for no reason.
[74:10.86]I don't know why I did that.
[74:12.36]I don't even want this.
[74:13.44]It's okay.
[74:19.89]Alright, let's go.
[74:26.50]Although, I say that now.
[74:29.70]But I wonder if electric skin is the reason why I didn't just die.
[74:41.39]Right?
[74:42.59]That makes some sense.
[74:45.47]Alright, I need a town.
[74:47.63]Here we go.

[75:37.65]You never explained the game.
[75:40.49]Oh, this is a game where you play... It's an RPG in pop-up windows on a fake medieval browser.
[75:46.13]Pretty good.
[75:47.66]Give blue items to the monolith.
[75:50.78]Oh, you just cheated for me.

[77:08.00]Oh, it's been like an hour and a half.
[77:09.36]Yeah, sorry guys.

[78:43.98]I actually wanted that.
[78:46.42]Kill the skeletons.
[78:48.47]You've arrived at the location for the quest.
[78:49.77]Are you strong enough?
[78:56.69]You see five skeletons just ahead of you.
[78:58.55]They haven't noticed you.
[79:02.69]Approach the skeleton.
[79:03.55]Can I talk to the skeleton?
[79:05.59]You see the skeletons are blocking the entrance to a small tomb.

[80:32.47]These are not worthless, from what I've been able to figure out yet.
[80:38.07]The skeletons are gone and the entrance to the tomb is clear.
[80:39.93]It looks to be the source of the skeleton troubles.
[80:43.78]If you enter the tomb, you can hear the rattling of bones.
[80:46.46]Uh-oh.
[80:51.61]I don't have any magic.

[84:03.29]Get off the computer!
[84:10.89]You played Lord of the Rings for 12 hours.
[84:12.65]Now that's the real problem.
[84:15.21]Right?
[84:15.55]That's the real issue.
[84:22.44]should be very concerned about you you should not be concerned about me moving around windows on a desktop as much as you should be concerned about me needing to complete a crusty PlayStation 2 game from 20 years ago why is it always the PlayStation 2 games every stream that's been longer than 10 to 12 hours has been on an old console like ps2 or Dreamcast
[84:48.97]You know, it's because I don't want to let it beat me.
[84:50.31]That's the problem.
[84:51.01]I don't want to let it win.
[84:52.19]Because it's old game.
[84:55.59]Old PlayStation 2 where you can't beat the old PlayStation 2 games.

[94:06.40]He was gonna get- everyone thought he was gonna get nominated.
[94:08.56]He was- there was a lot of buzz around his performance in Uncaught Gems.
[94:12.14]I was- when I saw that, I was so mad.
[94:14.10]You know why?
[94:14.72]Not because I give a shit about Adam Sandler.
[94:16.54]Because I wanted to come into this stream and be like, Adam Sandler just got nominated for Academy Award!
[94:23.46]And everyone would be like, NO!
[94:25.31]NO!
[94:26.11]IT'S NOT TRUE!
[94:26.75]IT CAN'T BE!
[94:27.39]And then I'd be like, yes it is, but I can't fucking do that now.
[94:32.85]It's too bad.
[94:36.10]It really is too bad.
[94:37.08]I really thought I was going to be like, I told you guys.
[94:39.58]I told you it was going to happen.
[94:52.67]Sandler squad.
[94:54.52]Ooh, a potion.
[94:58.08]Alright.
[94:58.58]So you're saying go to the monolith?
[94:59.94]Should I do that first?
[95:03.90]It's not true.
[95:04.48]It's impossible.
[95:05.44]No, no.
[95:06.28]No, he's supposed to be not funny and a loser.
[95:10.51]No, I can't take it.
[95:11.95]And if he won?
[95:12.53]Oh, that would be fucking hilarious.
[95:15.34]That would be so funny if he won.
[95:20.07]I would get a... I would get a framed photo of him in Uncut Gems and put it in my office here.
[95:29.08]If he had won the Academy Award for Best Actor.
[95:31.12]And every time I would turn on my facecam, he'd be reminded.
[95:34.41]And he'd be like, grabbing your face and pulling it down like, Every time I see it, it makes me fucking angry.
[95:46.35]And I'd, like, put my hand on it and, like, put my head down and, like, say, like, just, like, okay.
[95:50.67]Getting ready for the stream.
[95:51.51]That's how I would turn on every stream.
[95:53.47]I would put my hand on it, put a head down, and, like, get the energy from Adam Sandler.
[95:57.61]That's how I would start every single fucking stream.
[96:03.16]Too bad.
[96:07.40]Sad.
[96:11.70]I don't want to use that.
[96:16.82]Do my own Oscars.

[114:18.10]Okay, I can't do this.
[114:19.26]I have to leave.
[114:22.51]I read the book.
[114:23.21]Yeah, but I thought that was like a generic like, and the coming darkness will soon consume us all.
[114:29.18]Run for your life.
[114:29.82]I didn't know it meant like, oh, by the way, there's a chance if you're in the shadow, you're gonna get attacked by a fucking super monster.
[114:39.45]What do I do about this?
[114:49.61]Okay.

[115:44.67]Okay.
[115:47.05]Approach.
[115:49.22]The Wanderer greets you.
[115:51.47]The Wanderer wonders what you'd like to discuss.
[115:54.39]I'd like to talk advice.
[115:58.67]Dungeons are dangerous, but they hide great treasure.
[116:01.56]Nice.
[116:03.34]Great.
[116:04.14]Good advice.

[195:29.49]Regular Potion.
[195:34.95]Okay.
[195:38.03]I have exactly zero dollars.
[195:39.56]I use my money very wisely.
[195:49.51]I gotta go kill this monster.
[195:51.13]I gotta kill this thing.
[195:52.03]This thing's gotta die.
[195:54.63]I'm gonna sell some of this stuff, actually.
[195:55.95]Because I want to be able to sleep.
[196:05.59]I gotta pull out my storage.
[196:08.39]Orb.
[196:09.23]Ring.
[196:10.51]These beast eyes, do I even need them?
[196:15.16]I haven't had a quest for them.
[196:37.13]Alright.

[197:04.85]I got two mana potions, one healing potion.
[197:08.24]Go to the monolith.
[197:15.30]Beacon has loot, too?
[197:18.40]Does the beacon have loot?
[197:23.12]I mean, I have to fight a boss.
[197:26.75]If I do this quest first...
[197:29.32]I get 2000 experience.
[197:33.62]This is probably harder than this.
[197:36.32]The beacon is probably harder than this quest.
[197:40.62]Right?
[197:46.19]I would assume that the quest is probably not as hard.
[197:49.31]Give the sword to the monolith.
[197:50.91]I will.
[197:53.89]2k is solid.
[197:54.71]Let's go.
[197:58.32]We've arrived at the location for the quest 17, Outsiders Slain by the Monster.
[198:01.97]Alright, I'll get you ready.
[198:07.85]You come to a small cave.
[198:08.73]There is a mess of food scraps and empty potion bottles at the entrance.
[198:14.02]Enter.
[198:15.14]Entering the cave, there is an overwhelming stench.
[198:17.06]This must be the home of the terrible beast described in the message.
[198:25.43]Teleport?
[198:26.79]No, that's going to waste time.
[198:29.13]No, I can't.
[198:29.90]I can't do that.
[198:34.24]Because... Where is that smart?
[198:43.48]Preserve the mana.
[198:44.24]Do invisibility.
[198:45.18]Okay, I'm going to do invisibility potion.

[199:22.70]Have you come to fight me too?
[199:26.00]No, I'm asking about the stolen shipment.
[199:29.72]The Beastman turns his head away from you and says nothing.
[199:32.24]He seems to be eating something.
[199:35.19]What are you eating?
[199:38.67]In front of the Beastman is a half-empty crate of food supplies with the Adventurers Guild logo on it.
[199:47.37]Ask him about the stealing and the killing.
[199:51.48]He turns around quickly I didn't kill anyone!
[199:54.80]He looks glum I only stole his shipment because I was hungry and don't like hunting Take the freight away from him The Beastman doesn't resist he only lets out a whimper Leave him some of the supplies
[200:20.29]The Beastman thanks you and promises to stop stealing supplies.
[200:23.33]We got it.
[200:27.79]Without any violence.
[200:30.53]No violence necessary.
[200:35.40]What is this?
[200:36.54]Enemies can't see you.
[200:37.34]I'm getting to the end.

[201:37.14]This is terrible.
[201:39.20]Increases magic power by 20%.
[201:40.38]Decreases your defense by 15%.
[201:46.55]That's got to be 80%.

[202:28.53]Okay.
[202:30.92]Now it's time to fight the boss at the monolith.
[202:36.80]Did I get any money for that?
[202:52.65]Alright, what do I got?
[202:54.26]What's going to happen here?
[202:55.02]I'm going to lose... I need 10 strength to put this on.
[203:07.06]I lose magic power to gain defense.
[203:10.01]I can't use it because I need...
[203:22.20]Hold on.
[203:23.95]I need 10 strength to put it on.
[203:36.68]And the shield, I can't put the shield on too.
[203:47.59]What is this?
[203:48.01]The shield needs even more.

[205:07.70]What the hell is going on?
[205:16.12]What?
[205:33.51]Why is it doing this?
[205:42.53]It's because my agility is too low.
[205:45.10]I'm going into the negative agility.
[206:01.25]Okay, so you can't have negative agility.
[206:04.69]But what am I going to increase?
[206:05.75]I don't know.
[206:09.35]This thing is awesome.
[206:11.43]17 defense versus 5.
[206:15.45]And plus 2 to everything.
[206:16.47]That's really, really good.
[206:30.45]Is it worth pumping strength for?
[206:32.07]I don't know if it is.
[206:32.93]I'm supposed to be a mage.
[206:58.25]Armor shop, how we doing?

[207:07.45]I'll store it.
[207:08.87]Although I do want to bring the sword and the monolith.
[207:12.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[207:19.54]Jerma, you're a buffoon!
[207:20.54]Jerma, you buffoon!
[207:21.72]What are you, a buffoon?
[207:22.74]Oh, come on.
[207:30.80]This is just a better version of the thing that I have on.
[207:34.44]It's the not-cursed one.
[207:36.86]Alright, let's go fight the boss.
[207:47.27]Do you have potions here?
[207:48.69]I do.
[207:50.15]I don't think I have enough money to even pay for a potion.
[207:53.91]Do I?
[207:57.47]I don't.
[208:04.69]I might have enough.
[208:06.51]Alright, here we go.
[208:08.89]I'm going in here and I'm gonna light the beacon and I'm gonna spam 70 damage fireballs at this guy.
[208:13.92]Here we go.
[208:26.77]Use the attack potion and then spam fireballs.
[208:32.65]Read warning.
[208:34.16]Light the three beacons.
[208:35.06]Open the path to the king.
[208:38.80]Okay.
[208:39.02]Here we go.
[208:51.01]Get fucking decimated.
[208:52.65]Get absolutely decimated.
[208:54.23]I don't even know what your name was.
[208:56.25]I'm not even going to read it.
[208:57.78]I'm not even going to read it.
[209:08.05]Come on, the second major boss of the game does not have something that I could use?
[209:15.03]Toss, boulder 3, 10 crit, 15 crit damage, 25 damage to damage, 5 agility, 47 strength, my god.
[209:18.36]It's the charm.
[209:30.63]Maybe if you weren't such a wimpy nerd.
[209:33.05]Potions heal more.
[209:34.15]I mean, that's pretty good.
[209:38.34]The fucking face.
[209:39.90]The beacon is lit!
[209:40.76]Okay.
[209:42.40]Where's beacon number three?
[209:43.72]Here it is.
[209:52.25]Oh, I need to... I don't want to risk this.
[209:54.57]I'm taking a potion.
[210:08.95]37 gold.
[210:11.03]So, alright.
[210:12.97]If I go to the Monolith, and I extract the Legendary Power.
[210:21.16]Help drain slower when taking damage.
[210:24.02]What's that even mean?
[210:26.04]Oh, that means I can heal it if I need to.
[210:28.86]I see, I see.
[210:29.54]Selling Legendary Relic.
[210:30.66]Omega Monka LOL.
[210:31.84]What, did you just call me small?
[210:35.65]Did you just call me small?
[210:38.53]I'll go off on you again.
[210:39.85]Don't make me... What did you say?
[210:48.10]Unironically mad.
[210:51.48]He's still thinking about it.
[210:52.72]Alright, what are we doing?
[211:00.51]I'm gonna sell the ball mace.
[211:03.55]Yeah, I know what he wants.
[211:08.40]Anger, anger, anger, anger, anger, anger, anger.
[211:16.21]He's so fucking angry.
[211:17.13]He's so fucking angry.
[211:17.95]Everybody watch out.
[211:18.85]He's fucking flying off the handle.
[211:22.37]Another meltdown stream.
[211:23.58]Back-to-back meltdown streams.
[211:25.34]Back-to-back.
[211:28.10]Okay.
[211:32.04]Let's go... I don't know.
[211:33.58]Maybe I should sleep.
[211:35.38]Yeah, I'll have plenty of them.
[211:36.61]Sleep!
[211:37.09]Sleep!
[211:42.29]Ooh, demon tools!
[211:47.01]More and more people these days are looking to darker powers to protect themselves in the prophecy of the Sky Eater.
[211:52.46]Some go as far as summoning unnameable terrorists from demonic planes of existence.
[211:56.56]These demons can't always be properly controlled, and often protect themselves with the use of demonic wards.
[212:02.79]If you can bring us some of these wards, maybe we can better understand their power and use it against them, and your reward will be one of the fucking utilities from Monopoly.
[212:13.14]Uh, what was it?
[212:14.18]I don't think I've seen this yet.
[212:24.09]This is fine.
[212:24.45]Alright, I'm going for it.
[212:26.06]I'm going for it.
[212:28.08]And then I gotta go up here.
[212:30.82]What's max level?
[212:32.50]Anybody know?

[212:42.31]Make an offering.
[212:43.61]So, let me look at this.
[212:45.63]Three sunshines and a square.
[212:47.71]One sunshine.
[212:48.45]Thumb drop.
[212:50.42]And a piece of paper.
[212:51.32]I don't know.
[212:57.95]bottom right I know yeah I'm on low battery my computer's gonna turn off any second which by the way can we talk about this really quickly I'm fucking so angry at apple apple products I know it's because it's a battery you're charging a battery but just hear me out on this
[213:16.74]How many of you guys use your iPhone or your iPad until it's dead?
[213:21.69]Until it's dead.
[213:22.81]The little spinny thing happens and it fucking turns off.
[213:26.69]Happens to a lot of us, right?
[213:29.69]Why is it that when you plug in an iPhone or an iPad from it being dead?
[213:38.32]I don't know why this happens to me with both of my devices.
[213:41.82]This shit takes like 15 straight minutes to turn on again.
[213:47.59]Why can't it just run off the power?
[213:50.01]Why does it have to charge the battery to then turn, like, why can't you just run off the wall?
[213:59.26]Can't I activate something that says, please run from, draw from the wall?
[214:11.20]It's because of safety.
[214:12.00]Alright, what happens if I- What happens if there's like an emergency phone call I have to make?
[214:17.06]Oh, my phone's dead!
[214:17.84]Let me plug it in!
[214:19.56]Oh, hold on.
[214:20.02]Sorry, yeah.
[214:21.34]Just one second.
[214:21.96]Yeah.
[214:22.93]Can you sit there for like 15 straight minutes while my iPhone turns on to 8% battery before it turns on again?
[214:31.53]Don't let it die.
[214:33.55]I'm sorry.
[214:36.06]Apple phones just die!
[214:37.42]That's what they do.
[214:39.59]They drain to zero in like six hours.
[214:43.74]That's just what they do.
[214:49.22]I get so annoyed with that all the time.
[214:50.68]I will sit there, and the phone will be plugged in, and it'll be dead, and I'll keep trying to, like, six or seven straight minutes will go by.
[214:57.48]Hold the power button.
[214:58.86]Battery symbol.
[214:59.96]And I just hold it in front of my face, and I'm just like, turn, turn the fuck on.
[215:04.86]What are you doing?
[215:06.15]And sometimes the phone will turn on, and it'll be at, like, 14% battery.
[215:09.81]It's like, why couldn't you have turned on before?
[215:12.35]You're at, like, 15%.
[215:13.53]Doesn't make any sense.
[215:16.29]I get so annoyed with that.
[215:19.33]Sorry, I had to let it out.
[215:23.93]You could have turned on it at 4 or 5%.
[215:25.27]I know you could have.
[215:29.27]You're stalling.
[215:33.54]What?
[215:36.84]iPhones die at 30%.

[232:48.75]It was worth it.
[232:49.19]I'm gonna sleep.
[232:57.43]Alright.
[232:58.59]Storage.
[232:59.01]I stored this, so I'm not gonna use it for anything.
[233:04.15]or this or this shit uh okay this bill I need uh where my mana potions go they're over here right a lot of antidotes I'm not using this is important let's decide
[233:34.86]Okay.
[233:36.34]Let's do a decision here.
[233:38.82]Do I want to... Put this on.
[233:54.86]Because with these shoes, I lose magic regen.
[234:00.86]But I gain 7 strength.
[234:05.25]Which then allows me to put on this huge defense armor and +2 to every stat.
[234:12.80]No.
[234:12.86]You're going to give up all the fireball damage.
[234:16.08]Yeah.
[234:22.50]Use the shoes for the strength for the armor and then use the sword.
[234:26.29]The sword's gone.
[234:27.69]I got rid of the sword.
[234:28.83]I disenchanted it.
[234:30.29]I offered it to the monolith.
[234:34.95]Alright, we're gonna go with this.
[234:35.95]We're gonna go with what I have now.
[234:37.35]I made my bed.
[234:37.95]I might as well sleep in it.
[234:45.30]Oh, this is not an inn.
[234:50.50]Uh... So what is in your storage?
[234:56.69]Uh... Wait, you don't want this sword.
[235:06.76]Alright, let's just see what it looks like.
[235:11.37]You know what I mean?
[235:12.45]Let's just see what it looks like.
[235:13.83]We need to know what it looks like.
[235:14.97]Where are those shoes?
[235:21.85]Okay, here we go.
[235:23.85]21 strength.
[235:26.11]Leading into... 14 strength.
[235:30.55]22 vitality.
[235:31.47]32 intellect.
[235:32.63]Leading into...
[235:37.58]15.
[235:37.62]Requires level 16.
[235:39.20]I can't even put it on!
[235:43.76]I need to be three levels higher.
[235:49.71]Alright, let's go back.
[235:50.39]God damn, it's all backwards.
[236:15.11]Okay, can I do this now?
[236:16.13]Okay.
[236:31.06]Yes.
[236:31.82]Now the wheel.
[236:35.46]Now the wand.
[236:37.64]And now the ring.
[236:39.42]Ayayayay.
[236:43.87]Four into, like, five crit chance, what's going on?
[236:46.73]Alright.
[236:48.19]Yeah, we're just gonna go with this.
[236:50.43]I'm almost at a four team, but, you know.
[236:56.75]No, I said, aye-yai-yai.
[236:59.64]Aye-yai-yai, like, aye-yai-yai.
[237:01.92]I didn't say, I didn't, not the other way.
[237:03.56]Is this, is it an inn here?
[237:07.28]No, it's a dungeon.
[237:11.08]Shit.
[237:11.94]There's no inn over here.
[237:16.18]There's no inn!
[237:17.56]What am I supposed to do?
[237:18.48]I'm gonna have to take a mana potion and then fight.
[237:33.43]And then level up.
[237:34.13]Because I can't go anywhere.
[237:42.93]The only thing I can do is fight.
[237:47.85]I'm going to fight.
[237:55.41]Almost leveled.
[237:55.97]A beast eye.
[237:58.22]Used that earlier.
[238:02.06]Another wanderer.
[238:03.60]Wanderer greets you.
[238:05.20]I'd like some advice.
[238:07.02]Easier to escape from battle when your enemy is injured.
[238:10.62]Yes, it is.
[238:12.66]Invisibility?
[238:13.42]I'm trying to level up.
[238:14.98]I don't want to avoid a random encounter.
[238:17.98]I want to be random encountered.
[238:23.15]The wanderer is being attacked and is losing.
[238:25.69]There it is.
[238:28.81]Okay.
[238:34.13]Black fireball.
[238:38.97]very slow but very powerful fireball inflicts 110 fire damage to target and 28 to all enemies that's how slow is slow I mean
[239:06.63]This is 8 for 70.
[239:10.44]This is 7 for 110, but I could get two of these off before I get probably one.
[239:15.31]It's way too slow.
[239:16.49]Okay.
[239:16.71]Yeah, I won't use it.
[239:20.59]What should I get in its place, though?
[239:37.90]Great teleport.
[239:38.52]I don't think you can.
[239:42.74]I would do enchant on him, but we're way too... It's like the end of the game.
[239:55.03]Last body?
[239:59.32]That's so much defense to lose.
[240:00.96]I can't reliably... I'm scared to do that.
[240:05.81]Electric skin.
[240:07.15]Maxed out.
[240:08.03]Whatever.
[240:13.47]No loot.
[240:16.63]Alright, I want a rumor.
[240:21.59]Okay.
[240:23.79]Two healing potions.
[240:25.19]Two invisibility potions.
[240:27.05]I have an attack potion.
[240:31.73]Let's go.
[240:34.61]You see the king's castle.
[240:35.65]It's oddly quiet.
[240:36.45]Nothing grows on the ground nearby.
[240:39.79]Oh, your stats.
[240:40.41]Right, right, right, right, right.
[240:43.61]All into intellect?
[240:44.81]Or all into vitality?
[240:45.83]37.
[240:55.66]Okay, approach.
[240:59.36]With the three guardian beacons lit, the gate opens before you.
[241:05.07]I gotta move this shit around.
[241:06.78]Look at all this crap.
[241:07.46]Get this beast eye out of here.
[241:10.90]I want the antidotes.
[241:12.02]I want to move this up here.
[241:14.02]Okay.
[241:39.18]I want them next to each other.
[241:46.13]That worked.
[241:47.33]Cool.
[241:48.97]I just want them in an easy place to be.
[241:50.55]I want them right next to each other.
[241:51.51]Let's go.
[241:54.79]Alright, where... Where should I go?

[242:38.69]No.
[242:44.00]You can't see the... I'm not trying... Wait, I thought I was trying to find and kill the boss and not go to the exit.
[243:06.28]There's multiple floors.
[243:09.12]Oh.
[243:12.20]Fuck.
[243:13.92]Should I start?
[243:16.31]I'm gonna start.
[243:16.79]I'm gonna teleport.
[243:21.81]I'm gonna teleport.
[243:23.31]Teleport and then... Uh... Go down.
[243:31.84]Look at all this treasure.
[243:32.78]There's treasure everywhere.
[243:33.88]Do I have any dumb, useless items in me?
[243:35.70]I do.
[243:36.08]Why do I have all this?
[243:37.48]I have all this crap.
[243:40.34]I should have brought this.
[243:41.26]Come on, make it.
[243:52.55]Just disenchant it?
[243:55.81]I will.
[244:01.29]Approach the chest.
[244:02.24]Open it.
[244:03.94]Ah, that was a good.
[244:11.68]Stuff that I can't use.
[244:14.18]I'm looking for a good wand.
[244:15.45]Like an endgame wand.
[244:18.17]It's trash.
[244:22.67]Leave them for somebody else?
[244:25.05]Eh, fine.
[244:35.48]What is this?
[244:40.03]Cold Aura 3?
[244:43.83]3 magic regen, 10% magic power, 1 damage protection, 15 magic fine.
[244:47.79]What's Cold Aura 3?
[244:51.36]Heavy plate armor.
[244:52.18]I can't use this.
[244:52.84]24 strength.
[244:53.14]Leave that for somebody else.
[244:58.95]Get it?
[245:03.77]This is six crit.
[245:04.99]Hold on.
[245:08.04]Nine magic regen.
[245:09.70]Three magic regen.
[245:13.40]More damage.
[245:15.50]More magic find.
[245:22.08]I get- the agility goes away.
[245:23.50]Yeah, this is better.
[245:26.94]Learn skill Cold Aura.
[245:32.19]What does it do?
[245:35.13]A temporary aura that chills enemies for 4 seconds when they attack you.
[245:41.21]Wait, what?
[245:49.27]So I have to activate it.
[245:50.75]How much does it cost?
[245:51.63]3 mana?
[245:51.87]That's not bad.
[245:53.87]So I just turn that on right before they hit me.
[245:59.65]That's pretty sick.
[246:02.59]Okay.
[246:02.79]Let's keep going.
[246:09.41]They put all these... They put all this stuff in here.
[246:16.41]No random.
[246:17.01]No random.
[246:18.11]Yes!
[246:20.52]Deft Orb of Stone.
[246:24.62]Oh, shit.
[246:25.28]Hold on.
[246:25.80]Give me this.
[246:26.70]Party Ring?
[246:30.20]Eight Vitality.
[246:39.14]5% damage protection, 7 agility, 8 damage.
[246:45.03]Better than the wheel?
[246:48.99]So this has no defense.
[246:51.25]But I get a bunch of agility, which doesn't really matter.
[246:54.81]I lose the block and I lose the defense.
[247:02.94]But I think that's plus 8 damage on my weapon.
[247:06.71]I don't think that's plus 8 damage to a spell, is it?
[247:11.77]I'm not sure that's the way it works.
[247:14.39]I think it's only on the... on a melee.
[247:18.75]Damage protection is good too, but is 5% damage protection better than 12 defense and 15% block?
[247:26.22]That's for a fucking scientist.
[247:28.06]That's not me.
[247:34.81]Disenchant?
[247:35.81]I will.
[247:36.09]I'll just get the last treasure.
[247:38.66]No random encounters either.
[247:39.56]This is beautiful.
[247:42.38]I got another orb.
[247:46.24]That's 10 damage.
[247:49.58]Small pack.
[247:50.70]Nice.
[247:51.90]And potion.
[247:52.38]Good.
[247:52.74]Alright.
[247:53.32]Small pack.
[248:02.96]Alright, I'm gonna open this up.
[248:04.23]Let's put this other crap in here.
[248:05.49]Uh... That's a huge weight too, yeah.
[248:11.73]They're just really dumping this all on me at the end of the game, huh?
[248:22.62]I wish that was magic damage.
[248:30.51]Alright.
[248:31.69]It's time to do some disenchanting.
[248:40.54]Wait, chat's saying it's all?
[248:41.64]It's global damage.
[248:45.24]Global damage, huh?
[248:56.16]I can't put this in there.
[249:00.41]18 to 19?
[249:05.76]Plus 8 to 70 isn't that much.
[249:08.08]No, it's not.
[249:13.88]This has protection on it, though.
[249:17.66]5% protection versus having the shield.
[249:24.49]I don't know.
[249:28.83]I have 28 defense now that's not good just go fast and just I don't block well alright we're going spam that's true we're gonna go spam technique because I'm gonna do attack power and then just spam fireball and just try to melt the final boss alright here we go
[250:02.83]Alright.
[250:03.13]Get this shit ready.
[250:05.55]No, I'm making... Okay, here we go.
[250:11.05]So I got my potions.
[250:12.69]I gotta get potions.
[250:13.57]I gotta better... This is not... I don't like this.
[250:17.93]Get the wheel out of here.
[250:22.92]Okay, attack potion.
[250:31.56]Attack potion?
[250:33.72]Please disenchant.
[250:34.94]But that uses mana.
[250:36.91]That uses mana.
[250:37.79]But that uses mana.
[250:41.33]Just telefrag him.
[250:42.35]I can't.
[250:45.23]You're gonna get potions.
[250:46.13]I'm not guaranteed to get mana potions.
[250:48.23]I might get... I might get invisibility potions.
[250:56.58]Alright.
[250:56.92]Alright.
[250:57.30]Alright.
[250:57.72]Alright.
[250:58.18]I'm going for it.
[250:58.96]We're gonna go.
[250:59.42]We're gonna disenchant the mighty boots.
[251:02.44]It was a mana potion.
[251:03.78]Good call.
[251:05.64]A hearty ring.
[251:08.82]Attack potion.
[251:09.60]Already got one of those.
[251:10.58]The orb of destruction.
[251:14.47]Okay.
[251:18.17]One more.
[251:20.67]Alright, it turned out to be a net gain.
[251:22.55]Because I got one extra mana potion.
[251:33.92]Here we go.
[251:34.60]Do these stack?
[251:42.34]Don't drink more than three of these.
[251:43.56]Okay, what happens if I drink three?
[251:46.30]Don't drink more than three.
[251:52.14]Okay, if I drink three, can I one-hit kill the final boss?
[251:56.30]Do we know if they stack?
[251:57.24]Okay.
[252:04.86]Wait, how many have I drank already today?
[252:08.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[252:09.82]Hold on, everybody relax.

[252:25.09]Okay.
[252:28.74]I'm gonna be at full mana.
[252:31.06]This one was free.
[252:31.62]Ready?
[252:33.24]Ready?
[252:40.40]You approach the king's throne.
[252:41.41]The king sits stiff and frail, and he's... I... A knight next to him in full armor speaks for him.
[252:47.65]Is this the pause?
[252:49.79]You've proven yourself to be the strongest outsider.
[252:52.31]If you believe you are stalwart enough to fulfill the prophecy, then show me your power.
[253:06.99]the fuck out, eh?
[253:07.83]I just ripped... Don't!
[253:08.65]I can't rip that out.
[253:09.45]I just broke something.
[253:10.25]I'm fucking so stupid.
[253:15.58]This is connected to a different spot.
[253:17.96]He's dead.
[253:19.90]Loot.
[253:21.24]Royal Disk?
[253:24.98]Reputation is power.
[253:26.46]Three intelligence, three vitality, three strength, three... What is it?
[253:29.44]Is it a weapon?
[253:40.34]What do you mean reputation?
[253:41.24]Where's my reputation?
[253:54.50]Oh.
[253:55.44]Like this.
[253:55.84]Okay, well, might as well just take this.
[254:00.09]Take the fall potion and take the royal disk.
[254:04.29]I mean, I'm not going to use it.
[254:10.25]Alright, so I'm going to do... Should I heal?
[254:11.93]I'm going to heal.
[254:19.56]Use a potion.
[254:22.48]Alright, I'm ready.
[254:23.74]Take another attack potion.
[254:31.51]Take an antidote.
[254:32.65]Alright, I need to put this full heal up here.
[254:34.03]Alright, I'm ready.
[254:36.21]Alright, but what if I run out of mana?
[254:38.11]What if I run out of mana?
[254:39.13]I'm gonna run out of mana.
[254:40.57]I'm gonna run out of mana.
[254:41.89]I'm gonna run out of mana.
[254:47.40]Kingsguard attacked you.
[254:49.46]The Kingsguard collapses.
[254:50.52]There might be hope after all.
[254:51.94]A layer of dust falls from the King as he lifts himself from his throne.
[254:57.18]Using a large staff to hold himself up, the King mutters an incantation and looks to his side.
[255:01.73]A portal opens beside him with a flash of light and a dark aura.
[255:08.31]The King sits back down on his throne and points toward the portal.
[255:11.99]He says nothing.
[255:18.91]what do you mean he says nothing uh okay in front of you is a blue portal as you approach the king speaks
[255:52.22]This portal will take you inside the body of the Sky Eater.
[255:58.50]I only have the power to send one person through, so it is up to you now.
[256:06.77]Find a way to destroy the Sky Eater from the inside.
[256:17.35]Oh.
[256:30.69]Oh no.
[256:46.11]It's wasting mana.
[256:47.17]I'm gonna... No, it's not a waste of mana.
[256:50.15]No, it's not.
[256:53.46]Now I'm going to travel.

[257:22.03]I don't want to take this.
[257:26.43]I don't want to take this potion because I'm going to level up.

[258:04.05]Charm of Fading.
[258:06.49]Not enough magic points?
[258:07.83]What the fuck are you talking about?
[258:08.89]Oh, I have to use magic.
[258:14.43]God damn it.
[258:15.11]It's alright.
[258:18.58]Alright, scroll up, burn three.
[258:19.66]I'm gonna use in the next fight.

[258:55.89]What should I do?
[259:00.21]Old aura 3.
[259:00.79]I haven't even used it.
[259:04.45]Last body?
[259:06.51]Last body?
[259:07.19]No.
[259:07.25]No, no, no, no.
[259:09.99]Electric skin.
[259:11.95]Electric skin is already maxed out.
[259:15.21]Vigilance.
[259:16.89]How about that one?
[259:20.27]That's not bad.
[259:21.01]I can instantly cast this one.
[259:28.14]That's trash.
[259:29.04]No, it's not.
[259:30.72]It's not trash.
[259:32.34]Critical focus.
[259:34.76]Just an increased chance to crit?
[259:36.50]Yeah.
[259:39.76]No, I'm not gonna do glass body.
[259:41.98]I can't.
[259:43.26]This is gonna be the reason why I lose the game.
[259:45.64]I'm gonna select this and I'm gonna get killed.
[259:48.12]I'm gonna take two hits and die.
[259:57.27]You've already lost.
[259:58.43]I have not already lost.
[260:06.55]I'm gonna do two crits.
[260:07.97]Critical focus.
[260:09.25]We're going super, super boring and completely boring and neutral.
[260:14.50]I did it.
[260:14.76]Nothing.
[260:29.40]This is... Now I teleport.
[260:30.62]Thank you.
[260:32.40]I'll take it.
[260:36.61]It's being guarded by a creature Hey, it's a mimic Limp rune spear of vitality book of apocalypse 16 vitality, that's a lot
[261:04.45]That's a huge amount of vitality.
[261:07.05]But... Okay, hold on.
[261:12.34]Hear me out.
[261:15.58]Oh, I don't have enough agility for this.
[261:19.48]Never mind.
[261:20.34]Well, here's Apocalypse.
[261:23.84]Beast die.
[261:24.54]Oh, great.
[261:30.58]Damn it.
[261:31.48]I don't want this.
[261:33.06]Oh, can I convert potions?
[261:34.46]Because I don't want those.
[261:50.71]Start drinking them?
[261:51.45]I can't drink... If I drink more than one or two more of these, I'm dead or something.
[261:55.07]40 intelligence.
[261:57.91]41 intelligence.
[262:04.32]It's a mimic.
[262:09.93]Don't drink them, you will die.
[262:11.17]I know.
[262:11.73]Can I drink one more, though?
[262:12.93]I only have one mana potion.
[262:15.82]This is really terrible, actually.
[262:17.06]This is really, really bad.
[262:18.12]I'm going to have to run away from fights.
[262:38.90]Attack normally?
[262:57.05]This is not a good idea.
[262:59.27]This is a bad idea.
[263:01.43]But it's kind of working.
[263:04.42]What a bad idea this was.
[263:05.46]Why did I listen to this person?
[263:07.18]Attack normally.
[263:08.04]Why did I listen?
[263:09.56]Why did I listen?
[263:10.26]Now I'm dead.
[263:14.36]Yeah, I only took 90% of my HP.
[263:25.39]Fuck!
[263:25.55]Fuck!
[263:30.53]No, this sucks.
[263:36.78]Doesn't take glass body and melees on his mage.
[263:39.52]No, I'm just trying something.
[263:45.68]Just teleport.
[263:47.17]No, no, no, I can't.
[263:58.73]I don't have any more mana.
[263:59.65]I gotta level up again!
[264:00.55]I gotta level up again!
[264:03.03]How do you not have anything on you?
[264:07.98]How do you have zero anything?
[264:13.78]Come on.
[264:24.15]Use the scrolls.
[264:24.95]I only have one scroll.
[264:29.28]chug attacks I can't I'm not chugging attack which way do I go I am regenerating though thankfully I'm not getting any random battles that's good whatever it's down come on oh wow that's what a great move
[264:59.89]Look at that.
[265:00.87]Look at that.
[265:01.79]Look at that.
[265:02.55]I need to kill one more person.
[265:39.25]Nice.
[265:44.49]Don't miss blocks.
[265:45.92]Wow.
[265:46.68]I'm a mage.
[265:47.38]I'm not supposed to be doing this in the first place.
[265:49.72]Apocalypse 2.
[265:51.42]No.
[266:26.23]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[266:27.49]Here it is.
[266:28.85]Okay.
[266:31.01]Do I have anything I can disenchant?
[266:32.31]Can I disenchant something?
[267:00.96]Fuck.
[267:28.28]Okay.
[267:30.02]Attack potion.
[267:32.38]And then pray that I can kill it.
[267:35.25]With three healing potions.
[267:38.15]Potion of attack.
[267:41.03]Do not... Disenchant, disenchant, disenchant.
[267:44.47]What?
[267:44.65]There's nothing else for me to disenchant.
[267:48.60]The royal dick thing.
[267:50.26]I already did.
[267:50.84]It's bugged.
[267:52.28]In fact, get this away from me.
[267:55.87]The orb has been... No, I have disenchanted everything.
[268:00.19]Yeah, it just... It's bugged.
[268:01.23]Okay.
[268:02.47]Let's go.
[268:10.98]There is an enormous heart-like organ.
[268:12.86]It beats so heavily you can feel the area around you change shape and the air rush back and forth.
[268:19.14]Destroying this will surely destroy the Sky Eater.
[268:25.95]Okay, here we go.
[269:04.94]Get the fuck out of here.
[269:06.51]I killed you.
[269:08.01]I win.
[269:08.43]I win.
[269:09.37]I didn't even get hit.
[269:13.43]Hold on.
[269:35.07]Okay.
[269:38.05]For the room around you begins to shrink and the air is sucked out from every direction.
[269:41.22]You try to escape but the passage quickly becomes too small.
[269:45.28]The air is gone.
[269:46.06]You lose consciousness.
[270:09.84]What?
[270:19.39]Is that the bad end?
[270:21.89]Did I kill him too fast?
[270:27.48]Name.
[270:27.96]Alvin5000 the Martyr.
[270:30.46]Level 17 Mage.
[270:31.36]Killed saving the world.
[270:35.49]Script time, day 2, hour 7, minute 24.
[270:38.41]Gems earned, 136.
[270:47.69]New character unlocked.
[270:49.49]Worthless.
[270:52.51]Spend your gems to unlock new what?
[271:03.82]Wait, you can unlock hotkeys?
[271:11.58]Plus 10 health starting.
[271:16.57]Oh.
[271:17.21]Master key.
[271:18.85]I get it.
[271:20.51]Ring of pain.
[271:22.89]But this is how you play the game more than once.
[271:31.96]Well.
[271:33.44]Uh.
[271:36.72]I want the pink theme.
[271:38.72]And I want the bone cursor.
[271:42.38]And I want the fancy font.
[271:46.19]And I want plus 10 health points and plus 4 magic points.
[271:53.63]And I want to be the master of a sword.
[271:57.09]Sword mastery.
[271:59.06]Alright.
[272:02.40]Alright.
[272:05.55]New adventurer?
[272:07.83]Choose class.
[272:08.47]Worthless.
[272:09.89]Weak, unintelligent, poor vagabond with only one arm.
[272:25.54]I don't want that.
[272:26.08]Let's do adventurer.
[272:31.38]I'm just curious as to what the heck's going on here.
[272:35.15]Who's the starting gift?
[272:38.89]Oh, I see.
[272:43.73]I see.
[272:44.23]I can only pick one.
[272:51.75]Okay, let's just... I'm just curious.
[272:53.74]I think, or Riot.
[273:01.36]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, I get it.
[273:16.14]It's just I feel like I download my computer has a virus.
[273:22.14]Oh, bone cursor.
[273:30.41]I got all these things.
[273:31.21]I didn't turn them on.
[273:39.67]Screen Okay.
[273:42.05]Nice.
[273:46.12]Now we're really, really going for it here.
[273:53.97]This is so ugly.
[273:54.97]Oh, this is fun.
[273:59.01]What's wrong with me?
[274:15.47]Ooh, Book of Chill.
[274:17.85]Oh, I can't learn that.
[274:18.88]I got a Nail Club, though.
[274:22.36]Eugene Gal.
[274:24.08]How the heck can I not use this?
[274:27.06]I just want to level up.
[274:30.35]I'm curious.
[274:30.69]I just want to level up.
[274:35.35]Alright, approach the gang.
[274:38.21]Fight.
[274:46.08]This character sucks.
[274:54.89]Now this is AAA gaming.
[274:59.41]Yeah, you can say that.
[275:04.79]You can shield.
[275:05.47]Yeah, who cares.
[275:06.65]But I'm going to level up, though.
[275:08.21]Hey, get...
[275:21.20]Alright, equip the sword.
[275:22.40]Oh, it's because of the- wait, no, no, no.
[275:25.13]Strength.
[275:27.75]What do I need to do this?
[275:28.65]I need to be level 3.
[275:30.71]Oh my god.
[275:31.37]Where's the sword?
[275:34.09]I'm on fire.
[275:42.76]Am I gonna die right now?
[275:46.00]Am I dead here?
[275:47.47]I'm gonna die here because of that.
[275:50.21]Ugh.
[276:06.63]I didn't have a weapon equipped.
[276:10.30]Saved the world in one try and then died at the first encounter.
[276:15.42]That is very accurate.
[276:18.09]That's what happened.
[276:21.33]Can I like... You want to bury them?
[276:24.57]Yes.
[276:24.79]It was a memento.
[276:27.41]The club you couldn't use.
[276:37.53]Oh, I can... What should I bury?
[276:38.89]Should I bury him?
[276:41.94]Put Alvin to rest?
[276:45.96]I think it's going to have to be the northern mash.
[276:53.62]That turns around.
[276:57.68]Or the limp ring.
[277:02.01]Or... I just get to keep his stuff.
[277:05.69]It goes to next of kin.
[277:08.14]I'm not going to put the most powerful weapon in the world into a coffin.
[277:15.08]It's mine now, dad.
[277:27.71]That's what you keep that.
[277:29.15]Oh, that's a good thing I clicked it.
[277:48.27]Kylie Kisser.
[277:52.82]Lunch Lock.
[277:56.62]Alright, here.
[277:57.58]Take the best weapon in the game.
[277:58.96]Hey, Lunch Lock.
[278:01.00]Take the best sword in the game.
[278:02.35]Alright, I'm done.
[278:05.41]I'm not playing another one.
[278:07.19]I can tell you can play this more than a few times, though.
[278:10.65]Can he not use it?
[278:14.34]It's in his inventory.
[278:15.10]That'd be level 6.
[278:23.91]And the weapon is gone.
[278:24.75]No, it's here.
[278:29.05]Here we go again with the end of the stream voice.
[278:35.20]Rhythm Heaven tomorrow?
[278:36.20]Yes.
[278:37.88]Rhythm Heaven is going to be tomorrow for the Wii.
[278:41.54]Today was a...
[278:45.64]I was a little under the weather today because I had to go get an mri done so I wasn't feeling a thousand percent today but I did I wanted to stream and this was a requested game so we'll leave it at that yes I said yeah with contrast
[279:11.92]uh but I do have some uh potentially very interesting news for you Joel has responded and it looks like we're going to do keep talking and nobody explodes this weekend I would assume we'll be doing that on Saturday that would be nice makes sense keep talking to nobody explode
[279:42.29]Another worst stream.
[279:52.39]Let's go worst stream 2020.
[279:54.03]No, I okay.
[279:56.95]If the worst stream 2020
[280:01.06]I mean, that's funny.
[280:03.08]That's funny, but I mean, I and the mods go through all the nominations to see what's what, and we, you know, take things out that maybe, ah, maybe that's the wrong category.
[280:13.01]Every single worst stream of 2020 cannot be a stream that I streamed with Joel.
[280:19.61]That can't be every nominee.
[280:23.05]That is actually kind of funny, though.
[280:27.52]So, I'm sorry, but that's not gonna happen.
[280:34.59]Community Content Night is also slated for Saturday.
[280:37.45]But what I'm going to assume is when we played last time, we only played for like an hour or two.
[280:49.67]Last, like a week or so ago when we did it, we only played for like an hour and a half.
[281:00.15]It's tomorrow?
[281:00.81]Well, technically Saturday.
[281:04.24]Or maybe, um... How long is Rhythm Heaven?
[281:07.94]How long is that game going to take to play?
[281:10.16]Hold on.
[281:10.74]Let me look this up.
[281:13.30]How long is Rhythm Heaven?
[281:17.90]It's long?
[281:18.76]Really?
[281:19.06]I always thought it was one of those games you could kind of
[281:28.99]Holy shit, this is, yeah, it's 8 hours.
[281:32.76]16 hours for the extras and main game?
[281:35.30]Oh my Jesus.
[281:38.34]Okay.
[281:45.79]Let me talk to him.
[281:46.65]Let me see what his schedule looks like.
[281:48.51]Because if not Saturday, then maybe we could do it on Sunday or Monday or something?
[281:57.54]Don't cancel rhythm.
[281:58.28]No, no, no.
[281:58.58]We're playing Rhythm Heaven tomorrow.
[281:59.68]I just didn't know it was that long.
[282:03.86]Probably two full streams to get through it.
[282:08.28]Let me see what his schedule looks like.
[282:09.80]And we'll slate it for like Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[282:13.66]One of those days.
[282:15.08]He's streaming now.
[282:18.22]Maybe it'll be better to do that on like Monday.
[282:20.36]I would say.
[282:29.35]Five minutes ago, he said he was playing it this weekend.
[282:30.91]Well, I didn't realize that Rhythm Heaven was like a 10-hour game.
[282:34.37]I thought it was like four or three.
[282:39.50]I was under the assumption that Rhythm Heaven was less than three or four hours long.
[282:46.42]It's because it's very hard.
[282:49.14]Oh, I'm going to love it then.
[282:50.30]Let's go.
[282:56.41]But tomorrow is going to be a very early stream.
[283:01.68]Not only is it Rhythm Heaven, it's starting at like 11 o'clock in the morning.
[283:11.33]So there is that.
[283:16.87]But that's going to be it.
[283:18.94]we do have I do want to briefly go over the bits from a few days ago, because I was up really late.
[283:28.08]And it was like a 13 and a half hour stream.
[283:30.98]So I do want to at least cover those as much as I can.
[283:41.78]Based and like, I don't remember saying half of that shit.
[283:48.34]Gimli stream.
[283:50.20]No outro?
[283:51.30]Yeah, yeah, there is.
[283:54.79]But I'm going to start with the bits and subs and everything, or at least the bits that we missed from a few days ago.
[284:08.80]It was about 13 hours worth.
[284:14.48]Let me get it open.
[284:16.42]I'll see you guys tomorrow morning bright and early pacific time which 11 a.m is not really bright and early but it is earlier you gotta stream more so I can get my wink points yeah I know I do get some music playing
[284:44.78]Irma wink grew pilled Alright, let's try to go through these in a timely manner We had five dollars from an anonymous cheer just five dollars It was a huge amount of community subs also it's every stream there's a bunch of community subs at the beginning now because of the hype train
[285:12.59]Thank you so much, guys.
[285:14.32]You guys, every fucking day, dump huge amounts of money on this stream.
[285:19.54]And now there's this incentive for a hype train.
[285:24.02]Thanks, guys.
[285:26.24]We had 250 from iPod Matt.
[285:28.32]He said, Jerma, I can't do this anymore.
[285:30.18]Any more hype and I'm gonna spontaneously combust.
[285:33.84]And he says, thanks, dude.
[285:34.82]And then he smashes his keyboard and it was him exploding.
[285:40.39]Hey, Cad, thanks for the 250, Cad.
[285:42.87]Is this the hype train for the bathtub stream?
[285:46.25]Nah, I ain't ever getting in a bath on stream.
[285:49.14]You know that horror story that happened in my made-up reality.
[285:54.94]Nearshu, thanks for the thousand bits.
[285:57.66]Thank you, Nearshu.
[285:58.60]Potion Dweller, thanks for 250.
[285:59.74]I'm so sick of these hype trains.
[286:03.68]They're genius because they're making you so much money, though.
[286:06.26]Even though I can tell you don't want them.
[286:09.62]Well, it's not that I don't want something like that to happen.
[286:12.56]It's just... I'm going to keep increasing the difficulty.
[286:22.28]For them to happen in the first place.
[286:25.46]So it doesn't happen every single time.
[286:28.76]Look, I mean, right, so he hates money.
[286:31.30]No, but listen, there's, there's, alright, there's a sub train every single stream.
[286:38.67]And it's like, that's very, very good for me.
[286:41.31]That's a lot of money.
[286:43.15]But I never, I don't want to have people think that that's something that they have to do every day.
[286:52.79]So, I increased it a little bit as of the last two days, so I'm going to make it... I'm going to raise the challenge a little bit to make it so it doesn't happen as often, and it might take a little bit more time, and it might be more difficult to do.
[287:08.64]Green pisses him off.
[287:13.48]Stream every day for a hype train every day.
[287:16.76]Taking a vitamin.
[287:23.23]I appreciate it, though.
[287:23.83]Thank you.
[287:24.23]Nearshu, thanks for the 400 bits.
[287:26.55]Let's go, fellas.
[287:28.55]StixRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[287:29.89]What's harder, beating the first level of Lord of the Rings, changing a tire, or drawing my persona?
[287:34.57]All those things are incredibly difficult.
[287:39.07]Hey, Chad, do you know that Jerma doesn't know how to drive a car?
[287:44.71]That's why he can't.
[287:45.37]That's why he sucks at fixing them.
[287:47.35]18% of people change their own oil.
[287:51.94]That's just, that's... Okay.
[287:54.29]I heard a wink.
[287:56.73]Wink.
[287:56.95]What do you mean the wink happened?
[287:58.27]Oh, it didn't.
[288:00.77]Wink?
[288:02.71]What?
[288:02.91]Wait.

[288:13.68]What?
[288:15.76]I can't find it.

[289:21.57]Why am I being so weird about it?
[289:27.31]I hate it.
[289:28.79]Okay, that's the only one that's gonna happen.
[289:30.73]Done.
[289:37.70]I don't like it.
[289:38.34]I'm not doing it again.
[289:41.96]That wasn't worth it?
[289:49.35]Of course it's not worth it.
[289:52.57]Of course not.
[290:04.59]Now that one was.
[290:07.91]Anyways, all those things are hard sticks.

[291:02.41]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[291:03.69]I thought I loved the hype train ride, but on my third train I started noticing the wires coming out of the streamer and the voice modifier he had.
[291:10.95]Even the starting soon planets are actually just pre-recorded footage.
[291:14.19]Honestly sucked all of the hype out of it.
[291:17.23]Thank you.
[291:17.61]Feels bad, man.
[291:20.49]Another wink.
[291:24.33]I don't see one.

[293:42.75]I heard they were going under.
[293:43.43]Is that true?
[293:45.29]I mean, it was like one of the 17,000 WatchMojo videos.
[293:51.09]Is that for real?
[294:03.85]They started charging an extra $1 for their original crust.
[294:08.04]Scumbags.
[294:09.60]How could they?
[294:12.80]Like when Subway made the $5 footlong and then made it the $6 footlong and then made it the $7 footlong.
[294:18.92]And then they said, oh shit, we'll do the $5 footlong again, but it's only like four sandwiches.
[294:24.02]Got that from a WatchMojo video.
[294:29.93]It's not even WatchMojo.
[294:31.81]There's another one.
[294:32.45]It's called like... There's like three of them that make the same videos.
[294:36.13]And they have the same person that talks...
[294:43.61]mojo watch looper yeah they no not much not matching mojo alright side I don't there's a lot and they all the same person talking it's that same lady it's that same girl
[295:10.05]We make videos every single day.
[295:12.69]So click on that bell.
[295:13.89]It's the same person in every video.
[295:21.62]You're acting like we've watched these.
[295:22.92]You had to have seen one.
[295:28.48]We make videos every single day.
[295:38.21]Are people still telling you to click on the bell in every video?
[295:43.81]You know, let me... I have to say this.
[295:48.06]How stupid do people think that the audience is that they have to be told every single day to click on the bell?
[296:01.95]Every single day.
[296:05.80]Remember, click on that bell to get notifications.
[296:09.44]Oh, okay.
[296:13.48]For 364 days, I'm going to tell you to do that because I don't trust that you're going to do it.
[296:21.92]Not like once a week.
[296:23.24]Not like once every other video.
[296:24.86]No, no, every single video.
[296:32.75]It's because of the new people.
[296:38.51]uh do you know how many of those new people don't aren't even not even logged into youtube what bell somebody just shared this video with me I'm gonna make an account to click a bell that's not gonna happen
[297:08.96]Smash the like button.
[297:10.54]Yeah, so the bell is... YouTube decided that they were going to make people's videos not show up, so you have to click another subscription button to be able to get people's videos?
[297:20.37]Is that what I... That's it, right?
[297:24.25]Hey, you subscribed to this person.
[297:26.87]You want to see their videos.
[297:30.79]You sure?
[297:34.91]What they should probably have done...
[297:38.09]Shouldn't they just have like a pop-up come up that says, oh, hey, by the way, notice you haven't watched the last 475 WatchMojo videos.
[297:47.55]Do you still want to subscribe to them?
[297:49.97]And that person could go, oh, fuck, yeah.
[297:54.56]No, I guess not.
[297:58.76]Why does it have to... Oh, by the way, this has been three days.
[298:02.26]It's been three days.
[298:06.03]Oh, so, dear Jerma985, we've noticed that you haven't, in the last four days, have not watched six years' worth of videos from WatchMojo.
[298:17.93]Oh.
[298:18.55]Oh.
[298:19.17]Okay.
[298:21.97]YouTube doesn't want to encourage you to cut down on potential watch time, though.
[298:27.03]Yeah.
[298:32.69]a lot to make that many videos man I can't I couldn't even think about it after I make one I don't know there's like a team of people but after I made a video back in the day I was just I was done I was done like I want to make one of these for like at least two days I'm tired I click the bell on your youtube channel but it must not be working because I'm not getting any notifications
[299:01.18]Oh shit, the sub box isn't broken.
[299:05.61]Wait, hold on.
[299:08.01]You didn't get my last five videos in a row that were top 10 scariest abandoned buildings?
[299:16.35]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[299:17.65]You should have.
[299:18.15]Hmm.
[299:24.63]Am I going to play Kenshi?
[299:30.11]No.
[299:31.90]I've closed the book on that.
[299:33.88]No kidding.
[299:35.74]The last three videos were doctor's appointments.
[299:40.00]Yeah.
[299:40.44]Alright, let's keep going.
[299:42.46]Uh, Cell, thanks for the ten dollars.
[299:44.54]Thousand bits from Cell.
[299:46.10]Thousand bits from Yoko.
[299:47.62]Thousand bits from LMM Man.
[299:51.08]All of you.
[299:51.94]Thank you.
[299:53.40]They say, fueling the train.
[299:54.40]That's Yoko, uh, Nova saying, fueling the train while I'm here, though.
[299:58.02]What part of Massachusetts are you from?
[300:00.03]You say Boston, but that's what everybody says.
[300:01.95]I'm from, well, um, there's a reason why people on the internet don't give direct echo locations of where they live.
[300:14.97]So this question is one I'm not going to answer.
[300:26.15]But you don't live there.
[300:29.83]My family does.
[300:31.31]My friend, you know what I mean?
[300:33.69]Hey, you don't live there anymore.
[300:34.89]You can just like... No one will care.
[300:42.49]But actually but you don't understand is you do what you have it, right?
[300:46.33]There's Boston City of Boston inside the city.
[300:52.31]I've rode the train everywhere I ate hot dogs What does that I don't know what that has to do with anything
[301:14.67]Inside city limits confirmed.
[301:21.20]But I appreciate the $10 though.
[301:22.40]Aren't you from rural Mass?
[301:29.02]What do you mean rural Mass?
[301:33.78]It's not like... It's not like Mississippi.
[301:46.99]I guess no, I guess that is right.
[301:48.95]I guess that is well not what you don't I mean like this Population per square mile all the way in Western Mass is 1 to 10 What?
[302:02.56]Wait a minute population per square mile 1 to 10 One person potentially per mile per
[302:15.71]That's ridiculous.
[302:20.66]Well.
[302:23.20]Squared mile, squared mile, squared mile.
[302:28.38]Dude, are you guys excited for the XFL?
[302:31.16]I can't wait for the XFL.
[302:34.92]That's gonna be... I can't wait.
[302:37.52]The XFL's coming back in a week.
[302:40.64]I didn't even know this was happening.
[302:43.00]This is the moment in the XFL where like there's no fair catch and people just run into each other and like throw shit at each other.
[302:48.50]Didn't they get?
[302:49.16]No, it's back.
[302:57.47]Two forward passes are allowed.
[303:02.11]Yeah, and they have a they have a shootout.
[303:05.11]If there's overtime.
[303:07.79]Like soccer or you know football.
[303:11.81]It's gonna be like hockey.
[303:14.18]That's gonna be ridiculous.
[303:16.14]I can't wait.
[303:21.48]I really don't care that much about sports.
[303:23.32]That much.
[303:24.60]But I feel like it could be entertaining to watch.
[303:29.91]You only need one foot inbounds to make a catch.
[303:32.37]It's a college rule.
[303:33.09]What is wrong with me?
[303:38.83]I'm talking about the XFL of the new football league from Vince McMahon that lasted one season back in 2002.
[303:50.99]It was a disaster.
[303:52.27]It's coming back.
[303:58.51]There was like four injuries every single game in the XFL.
[304:05.35]I gotta like read the rules, but is this coming back?
[304:12.64]Aren't you from Boston?
[304:13.38]I thought you liked baseball.
[304:14.40]I do, but I mean, I don't watch every single game or anything.
[304:18.22]I'll catch it if it's on.
[304:21.62]I do like baseball.
[304:22.44]I do very much.
[304:27.06]It's like the football game you played that was half Mortal Kombat.
[304:29.68]Blitz the League, one of the greatest video games ever.
[304:34.06]Speaking of sports, I didn't even tell you guys this, but over here I have a very special game.
[304:42.78]I got NBA Street over here.
[304:46.52]I'm going to play the absolute hell out of this.
[304:53.29]I've got quite the collection over here of video games.
[304:55.75]They're just waiting to be played.
[305:05.61]Both beautiful Joes.
[305:08.55]Not a big deal.
[305:09.11]Don't worry.
[305:10.60]What's that?
[305:11.30]Oh, Mega Man Legends 1 and 2.
[305:13.30]Over there hanging out.
[305:23.18]They're just sitting over there ready to pick one to be played.
[305:31.39]We'll see them soon.
[305:33.73]Tony Hawk's Underground.
[305:35.83]And Tony Hawk's Underground 2.
[305:39.17]I went nuts.
[305:44.65]And some other stuff, you know.
[305:50.69]Underground is the best.
[305:53.03]When are you going to do the Diablo II hardcore?
[305:56.17]When I get a little less busy.
[305:59.90]It's going to start to get really, really busy for me.
[306:05.46]I'm trying to not overthink this and overthink anything here, but over the next three or four weeks, I'm going to be very busy.
[306:18.44]I wanted to make sure I had a bunch of stuff ready to go lined up.
[306:25.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[306:27.04]There's no... There's no baby.
[306:33.12]Let's just quell that one immediately.
[306:41.50]Do you have any special videos that you mentioned?
[306:42.90]We're in the process.
[306:45.30]They've turned into streams.
[306:47.38]And yes, there is at least one very, very, very major project that is getting off the ground now.
[307:00.53]It's gonna be crazy.
[307:04.64]It is not the Rumble 2, although there are plans to try to do that
[307:13.22]Hopefully.
[307:15.16]If not in 2020, then very early into 2021.
[307:25.89]Then that stream is going to be fucking insane.
[307:37.16]What happened to FTK?
[307:37.92]I actually have a meeting with the FTK people in a couple days.
[307:44.75]I will give you a full update of what's going to happen to that server and what's going to happen for the next event.
[307:50.55]So it has not gone away.
[307:51.81]That's still... It's still kind of in the process of being worked on.
[307:56.29]It's firing them.
[307:57.35]No, I am not.
[307:59.11]What's the reverse of firing somebody?
[308:02.65]Alright, let's keep going.
[308:04.11]Let's keep going.
[308:06.05]Numblegs, thanks for the 5,000 bits.

[309:56.23]Dermot Tingey asked me, if dropping an iPad into the bathtub would electrocute you, it's like asking if dropping a banana in the bathtub would give you radiation poisoning.
[310:03.23]No, it's not.
[310:04.23]Banana's not made out of electricity.

[310:44.38]Listen to me.
[310:44.90]It's hilarious.
[311:02.06]Why couldn't it have been like Aragorn Day or like Legolas's Bow Day?
[311:07.90]Why couldn't it have been like the Shire's Garden Day?
[311:13.14]Anything.
[311:14.36]You have to make that Hobbit Day.
[311:22.53]I would have taken like Ogre Day.
[311:31.70]That's proof that we live in a simulation.
[311:33.63]It might be.
[311:38.37]Why is he spouting this out now?
[311:42.05]Why would I ever look online for any reason?

[312:40.70]I'm not even gonna... No, clear the chat.
[312:42.52]No, it's not actually real.
[312:44.96]No, it's not.

[313:19.83]Yep, I did.
[313:22.25]And Rhineville, if you're watching now, talking about putting the Greedy Grinner in a Magic the Gathering card.
[313:32.05]The Greedy Grinner actually being in a Magic the Gathering game.
[313:37.14]I would love to talk about that.
[313:41.86]I'm not sure if you hit me up yet, but if you're just messing around, you're just memeing here, then okay.
[313:47.72]But if you mean business...
[313:50.42]call my manager me that number is one five five eight two the long number
[314:19.96]He didn't believe it?
[314:21.20]That would be so stupid.
[314:24.08]Wait, that's my number! 155.
[314:44.84]But how can it be yours?
[314:45.78]That's mine.
[314:46.64]I know, I'm sorry.
[314:47.40]I just said your phone number.
[314:48.82]Imagine hearing your phone number over stream.
[314:55.55]I'm getting sidetracked.
[314:56.33]Alright, fuck, I'm sorry.
[314:57.45]Greedy Grinner and Magic the Gathering, Ryanville, hit me up.
[315:00.27]We'll talk.
[315:02.81]Uh, LM Man, thanks for the 400 bits.
[315:05.27]That's a reward for beating the first part of Fellowship.
[315:07.34]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[315:09.30]Sob Cryo.
[315:13.30]Thank you, Saab, for the thousand bits.
[315:14.76]As a kid, me and my brother used to play this game an insane amount.
[315:18.03]But for some reason, in our copy of the game, it was impossible to save.
[315:22.63]So what we did is just play as far as we could every time without dying.
[315:26.35]Because then we'd have to start from the very beginning.
[315:29.02]This made the Nazgul, among other things, so scary.
[315:33.12]And that one time I got all the way to Moira, it was so fucking fogged.
[315:39.66]The game is so hard.
[315:40.70]It's just so hard and so chunky and... But it still kind of holds up.
[315:59.20]Shanji, again, 10,000 bits.
[316:01.56]I think we went over it, but a fucking hundred dollars.
[316:04.18]They said, I was going to ask if you realize you've been baited into playing a game that's basically just a short joke, but then you confused candy for fruit and asked if dropping an iPad in the tub could kill you.
[316:14.09]So yeah, here's to my favorite sentry gun.
[316:16.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[316:18.39]Thank you.
[316:19.65]Thank you.
[316:30.79]Hey, SneakMan, thanks for 300 bits.
[316:32.27]Jerma's Gamer Challenge, every Saturday at 4 p.m.
[316:34.55]Central, only on twitch.tv.
[316:42.17]I love, okay, you can tell when I was losing my mind and having a problem and freaking out, and people may have been getting concerned, because you get, um, you get comments like this, and I actually don't even remember this, but I think I'm, the Mean Machine gave 5,000 bits, so they gave $50, which is huge.
[317:04.13]And they said, for the love of all that is holy, Jerma, you finished the first level of the game.
[317:09.13]I'm literally paying you 25 times the wager of the bet for you to go play with Joel instead of dragging this out.
[317:15.00]Holy shit.
[317:18.06]That was just about seven hours before the stream actually turned off.
[317:30.68]I think the stream went on for another eight hours.
[317:40.80]Flushy, 400 bits.
[317:42.64]Play with Joel.
[317:43.36]We would both enjoy that more.
[317:45.00]And, well, that'll happen soon.
[317:47.10]Don't worry.
[317:49.61]Yes is online.
[317:50.57]Ishanji, both 5,000 bits.

[318:02.44]Yep.
[318:07.08]Ishanji, thanks for 1,000 bits.

[318:36.72]Yeah, and today... Yes.
[318:39.34]And today, I had a little bit of a meltdown about... Yeah, I had a little bit of an issue today.
[318:45.84]Yes, I did.
[318:46.90]I'm not gonna lie.
[318:49.73]I saw... I went off a little bit.
[318:51.89]I got a little irritated.
[318:53.53]That's what happens.
[318:55.85]That's what happens when people throw darts at you.
[319:03.19]He's smoldering.
[319:12.15]It was a little issue.
[319:13.62]It was a little issue.
[319:14.60]Find me a clip of it being of more than a little issue.
[319:18.76]It was just a small issue.
[319:20.78]I told one person to fuck off, right?
[319:23.24]That's what happened.
[319:24.22]I said, hey, fuck you.
[319:25.62]What happened?
[319:29.15]There were 5,000 people here today.
[319:31.15]One person I said, hey, get out of here.
[319:33.09]What did I do?
[319:34.03]Did I do that?
[319:42.95]I didn't ban anybody.
[319:44.19]I don't... I don't... I don't ban anybody.
[319:50.19]My mods do.
[319:52.15]Or, uh, bad things that people do.
[320:04.20]You banned him for a day and then modded him for a week.
[320:08.52]Oh, I did say that.
[320:11.03]don't worry oh but yeah yeah bf Bugleberry does have some fans uh I'm one of them he knows that chowder man thanks for the thousand bits chowder man hey I remember you mentioned you were thinking of playing Outer Wilds the other night and if you're still considering it I highly recommend it I am and I will
[320:32.90]For the most part, the next... Let's see.
[320:36.14]Let's go over... Let me see.
[320:37.48]I'm curious myself.
[320:39.12]He's getting sidetracked again.
[320:40.62]Why did you do this?
[320:41.90]Don't do this, dude.
[320:42.58]You're getting sidetracked.
[320:44.08]Just fucking do the rest.
[320:45.02]Dude.
[320:45.44]Oh, my God.
[320:46.42]He's already got it open.
[320:47.22]Let's see.
[320:48.94]One, two, three, four.
[320:50.34]Hmm.
[321:01.50]I have planned out the next at least 30 to 40 streams of things that I know what I'm going to do.
[321:13.48]I'd say I have about 30 streams worth of stuff just ready.
[321:18.00]So I don't have to go, oh, what should I do now?
[321:20.50]What should I do today?
[321:21.28]I planned out a lot of stuff.
[321:26.14]Bugleberry is hot.
[321:28.94]That's your opinion.
[321:29.88]That's fine.
[321:30.26]You can have any opinion you want.
[321:33.90]Whatever.
[321:35.04]You think.
[321:35.40]Whatever.
[321:35.94]I mean, he's handsome, right?
[321:38.70]I agree with that.
[321:39.24]No one said that.
[321:39.79]Yes, they did.
[321:40.63]Look it up in the blogs.
[321:41.95]Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[321:43.27]This game takes me back.
[321:44.23]There was a Game Boy Advance game of both The Two Towers and Return of the King, which played as a Diablo clone.
[321:49.87]Good times.
[321:50.46]Diablo II Hardcore Until I Die is a stream as well.
[321:56.52]I'll be playing that.
[321:57.80]Should be fun.
[322:00.12]chat is going to here's the thing about that that's what you need to make it a little more interesting chat is going to pick the class and pick every single skill point so make it a little more interesting I give it 10 minutes
[322:25.05]Are you doing that because you do not want to win?
[322:27.05]I'm doing it so I can prove that no matter what anybody throws at me, Diablo II is my favorite video game top five ever.
[322:36.38]I can deal with anything you throw at me.
[322:37.64]You don't think I know the synergies for every single fucking item in that game?
[322:40.20]You don't think I know every single item, every single skill?
[322:46.10]Oh, let's make him a sorceress and put 20 points into warmth.
[322:50.34]I can deal with that.
[322:51.74]In fact, I hope you do that.
[322:52.64]Reverse psychology.
[322:53.50]Do it.
[322:54.57]See what happens.
[322:59.03]Oh, shit.
[322:59.51]He actually knows the skills.
[323:06.73]Hey, Cad.
[323:07.98]Cad, you're here.
[323:08.46]I saw you.
[323:09.70]I hear this is the stream to watch bootleg movies.
[323:11.74]Keep up the great work, comrade.
[323:26.77]Yeah, that's funny.
[323:28.87]That's funny.
[323:29.61]Oh, legit.
[323:31.64]Alright, if you look up who's watching a movie right now, if you watch it with a load of the frames... That stream was funny.
[323:47.51]That stream was a lot of fun.
[323:54.35]Thank you, Cat.
[323:54.85]Thank you, Orange Julian, for the 500 bits.
[323:57.13]Cheers to your gamer snack.
[323:58.31]It was delicious.
[323:58.99]Thank you.
[324:00.09]Jerma's Pet Ferret.
[324:00.93]I don't have a Pet Ferret, but thank you for the $5.
[324:02.45]Appreciate it.
[324:06.16]They say, Hey, Jerma, I'm Saimi.
[324:09.18]I suffer from swelling and pain in both of my hands.
[324:11.32]It makes it almost impossible to use them some days.
[324:14.28]I'm a writer, artist, and a gamer, and I work with dogs.
[324:19.00]Pretty awesome.
[324:20.95]I used to work with dogs, too.
[324:22.82]I volunteered at an animal shelter.
[324:24.38]It's awesome.
[324:25.06]I highly recommend it if anybody has not done it before.
[324:28.58]Thank you.
[324:28.92]Thank you for the 500 bits, first of all.
[324:51.97]And second of all, just know that most people are going through something.
[325:02.64]They are.
[325:05.24]And I think a lot of people forget that.
[325:06.32]I think a lot of people don't remember that and don't realize that, you know?
[325:11.16]And if you can collectively... You know, that's what I like to tell people about.
[325:15.76]But Jerma, why do you tell people about this?
[325:17.78]Why do you tell people about all the things happening in your life that aren't very good?
[325:22.54]It's because I want to be a real person to you guys, you know?
[325:28.77]I want you to know that there are bad things that happen in everybody's lives, essentially.
[325:35.63]There are good things and there are bad things.
[325:37.43]And I think that talking about the bad things lets us all know that we're human.
[325:54.52]So that's one of the reasons why sometimes I do share things that aren't really going great.
[326:00.21]Or medical problems like you have yourself as well.
[326:05.25]I wish you the best.
[326:11.58]I wish you the absolute best.
[326:16.40]Thanks for watching.
[326:17.08]Thanks for being here.
[326:19.96]And keep going.
[326:23.48]As best as you can.
[326:31.84]Moving on from that, we had $5 from Ashanji.
[326:35.10]Recipe for Jerma Jerky Smoothie.
[326:36.94]When?
[326:38.36]It's called Open a Bag of Crave Beef Jerky.
[326:41.48]It's the best.
[326:48.45]Without a question.
[326:49.59]Without any single question at all.
[326:52.73]The only problem with Crave Beef Jerky is it is incredibly expensive.
[326:57.48]But it is the best.
[327:01.52]It's the best.
[327:03.76]I've had lots of beef jerky before.
[327:06.04]I've never had one that was better than Crave.
[327:10.87]It's just very expensive.
[327:17.07]It's like $8.
[327:18.05]Yes.
[327:19.53]It is like $7.50 or $8 for one of those bags of beef jerky.
[327:23.53]It's only like one or two and a half.
[327:25.10]I could eat the whole thing in one bag.
[327:32.06]And that's the problem when you go get it.
[327:35.46]Oh.
[327:36.62]Crave beef jerky.
[327:38.22]Alright.
[327:39.28]I love this stuff.
[327:41.04]You know, how many?
[327:41.52]I'm gonna grab like four of them.
[327:43.12]Yeah, I wanna make sure I have some in case I'm hungry and get one little snack.
[327:48.86]Then you go to the checkout and you realize that you just bought like 40 fucking dollars of your grocery bill as beef jerky.
[327:56.69]And you're like, what?
[327:57.41]Why is my grocery bill so high?
[328:01.24]It's forty, what, fifty dollars for that?
[328:04.82]Oh, right, because I got like five or six, like, crazy.
[328:08.54]That's a huge amount of money for my grocery bill.
[328:11.46]Okay.
[328:14.82]Fine dining.
[328:19.77]But, like I said, it would be one thing if it was expensive, and not the best.
[328:25.55]But it's expensive, and the best.
[328:31.22]One of my favorites is Chili Lime.
[328:34.86]Oh.
[328:35.78]Doesn't get better than that.
[328:38.68]Is it Sweet Chipotle?
[328:40.02]Mmm, it's okay.
[328:40.90]It's not as good as the Chili Lime, though.
[328:42.30]Seriously.
[328:47.54]Derm is part of the 1%.
[328:50.28]1% jerky.
[328:52.90]Jack Link's original... Well, hold on.
[328:54.60]Jack Link's original versus Crave original.
[328:59.55]Let's get it.
[329:05.85]What's the best beef jerky for you?
[329:08.37]Like, what's the highest quality?
[329:09.63]Let's see.
[329:12.87]Uh... Try Jack Link's if you want a classic standard.
[329:17.44]Classic standard.
[329:22.06]Try Crave if you like super niche flavors.
[329:28.65]Black cherry barbecue pork jerky, lemon garlic turkey jerky, garlic chili pepper beef jerky.
[329:34.55]Ooh, that sounds pretty good to me.
[329:37.43]It's because it's weird.
[329:38.35]No, it's not.
[329:39.05]It's great.
[329:41.20]Hold on.
[329:41.40]What's the best and worst beef jerky ranked?
[329:45.68]What's the worst?
[329:47.08]Three jerks jerky filet mignon beef jerky apparently is the worst jerky ever.
[329:53.94]And then chef's cut real steak jerky apparently is second worst.
[330:00.42]Alberto original beef jerky is like Jack links coming in at number three Jack links original beef jerky number three.
[330:10.86]Oh fuck off Crave original sea salt at number two.
[330:15.05]What's number one?
[330:16.79]Oh Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[330:18.13]Whoa.
[330:18.43]Wait a minute.
[330:18.89]Whoa.
[330:19.21]Whoa.
[330:19.73]Whoa.
[330:19.93]This is the worst.
[330:20.95]This is the worst.
[330:21.57]This is top worst This is number two worst.
[330:24.70]What's the worst beef jerky?
[330:26.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait This is the worst
[330:33.44]What's wrong with- what do they say about it?
[330:44.71]Yes, Krave's jerky is made with an impressive list of all-natural, minimally processed ingredients, but this tiny one-ounce serving has 10 grams of sugar in it.
[330:53.69]A third of every gram of jerky is sugar.
[330:56.49]For comparison, a fifth of each gram of glazed Krispy Kreme donut is sugar.
[331:03.32]Who gives a shit?
[331:11.29]Hold on, this is now the best.
[331:13.13]Alright, hold on.
[331:15.35]This is... I'm actually mad right now.
[331:17.41]What's number one?
[331:19.11]Brooklyn Biltong?
[331:23.58]Fucking baloney.
[331:25.10]Yep, baloney.
[331:26.74]Baloney.
[331:30.72]Oh, do my... Oh, I have to do the bits.
[331:32.52]Yeah, you're right.
[331:37.68]Um... Alright, yeah, I gotta finish this.
[331:43.47]Pray to be sure he's the best reader you've ever had.
[331:46.27]Oh, it's a donut.
[331:48.49]It's not a donut.
[331:51.95]Yeah, and when you eat white bread, your body treats it like cotton candy.
[331:55.48]Whoop-de-fucking-do.
[331:56.66]Do we really have to debate that?
[332:02.55]Okay.
[332:03.29]Anyways.
[332:05.75]Uh, we're excellent.

[335:00.73]I can't even, like, present an argument against any... You know what I mean?
[335:04.41]It's like I run into, like, a brick wall.
[335:09.82]Irma's really scary.
[335:15.88]What is this?
[335:17.14]I want to listen to this.
[335:17.80]I don't even know what this is.
[335:18.58]This is not even the same stream.
[335:21.93]Yes.
[335:22.55]God, you guys are mean.
[335:24.09]Does he tell you guys are mean?
[335:25.17]Because like... Wait, this video is not in my stream.
[335:28.55]This is Tomato's stream.
[335:33.10]Streamers, I try to avoid it.
[335:35.80]Yes.
[335:36.44]God, you guys are mean.
[335:37.96]Does he tell you guys are mean?
[335:39.04]Because like... It seems like everyone's in on some joke about bullying him for his height.
[335:43.22]That's pretty toxic.
[335:44.46]What the fuck?
[335:48.05]You guys bully me for my colorblindness, I guess.
[335:50.07]Which isn't actually even colorblindness.
[335:52.09]It's gaslighting.
[335:53.35]So I guess... Everything goes.
[335:58.09]Have you not met him in person?
[335:59.35]I've met him multiple times in person.
[336:00.73]Every single time I've met him.
[336:02.03]He hasn't been that short.
[336:04.07]He's been moderately tall.
[336:08.37]Not at best.
[336:09.03]He was like...
[336:11.83]He wasn't short to me.
[336:13.41]Didn't seem that short.
[336:15.31]Then again, he was on like ve- he was wearing like very high heel shoes.
[336:26.17]At the time that I met him.
[336:38.36]Ugh.
[336:39.68]Tomato's a great guy.
[336:40.52]He is.
[336:41.21]He actually is.
[336:48.19]Joe's actually mad.
[336:49.71]Talking about the wind being taken out of your sails.
[336:57.86]What's like having a direct line to hundreds of nine-year-olds every night?
[337:11.57]I need to finish the bits.
[337:15.11]We gotta get out of here.
[337:22.33]No, what set it off completely tonight was somebody came in and said... What was it?
[337:29.22]It was like...
[337:30.69]like LOL I'm 15 and taller than Jeremy and it's like dude your height is in your dna I I didn't like I didn't like eat corn on the cob only and like lettuce you just that's just how tall you are I didn't I didn't like eat sand for breakfast and lunch and dinner every day I just happened to not be that's like our dna man
[338:01.78]It's like not so surprising.
[338:08.10]Oh man, BoxBox coming in with a raid.
[338:11.42]BoxBox said you would feed us.
[338:15.18]BoxBox says you would feed- BoxBox said you would feed us.
[338:21.32]What do you want to eat?
[338:23.74]BoxBox coming- BoxBox, we're at the end of the stream hanging out, but thanks for the raid.
[338:27.99]Welcome everybody.
[338:30.52]What do you guys want?
[338:31.40]Corn?
[338:31.66]I've got lots of sand.
[338:34.99]I've got sand, I've got corn, I've got lettuce.
[338:37.41]Apparently the only three things that I've ever eaten in my life to make me smaller than a 15-year-old.
[338:45.71]If only he had eaten his vitamins and had broccoli, maybe he would... You know what?
[338:51.27]I'm not even going to get into it anymore.
[338:54.03]No, I've said my piece.
[338:57.92]Sand isn't food.
[338:58.94]But hey, welcome.
[339:00.30]1,700 people.
[339:00.90]Almost 2,000 people in a row.
[339:02.04]Thank you, BoxBox.
[339:03.66]Welcome, everybody.
[339:05.36]We were currently debating how tall I was and how people are comedians.
[339:17.70]It's interesting that there's thousands of comedians here.
[339:22.10]And they must all be part of the same comedy group because they all say the same jokes.
[339:26.84]They're all together in the, I guess, in the same room, I guess.
[339:32.76]It's not much of a debate.
[339:38.44]We're all funny.
[339:39.78]There it is.
[339:40.30]There it is.
[339:40.72]There it is.
[339:41.06]There it is.
[339:41.42]There it is.
[339:41.74]There it is.
[339:42.46]There it is.
[339:42.95]There it is.
[339:43.45]Do it.
[339:43.73]Everybody do it.
[339:52.98]Alright, almost done with a few days ago.
[339:55.44]By the way, again, BoxBox, thank you.
[339:57.80]Hope you had a good stream.
[339:58.52]Hope you guys are having a great night.
[340:03.73]Tomorrow I'll be streaming Rhythm Heaven for the Wii.
[340:08.39]As we wind down for the end of tonight's stream.
[340:15.27]But yeah, we're currently going over the bits.
[340:18.63]I don't read subs or bits or any donations on stream.
[340:22.97]We do it at the end of the post stream, which is what we're doing now.
[340:26.47]And we had a very, very, very long stream a few days ago that I almost collapsed and couldn't stand anymore.
[340:35.65]So I had to leave and it was a 13 and a half hour stream.
[340:37.93]And I was like, I got to get out of here.
[340:39.09]So we're doing them now.
[340:40.89]I could have just said that much easier in about one sentence.
[340:47.41]Right?
[340:48.03]That was much easier just to say, hey, I'm doing the bits from three days ago.
[340:52.09]Okay.
[340:53.59]Alright.
[340:54.05]Half Monty, thanks for the $5.10.
[340:56.65]Great job, Jeremiah.
[340:57.39]I knew you had it in you.
[340:58.21]Super entertaining in a painful kind of way.
[340:59.87]Yeah.
[341:01.53]Orange Julian, 1,000 bits.
[341:03.62]Ashanji, 1,000 bits.
[341:06.04]Both of you.
[341:07.90]Go for it.
[341:08.28]You're the man.
[341:08.72]You can do this.
[341:09.28]Wow, this game looks really hard.
[341:10.44]You are also a nice person.
[341:12.06]You did it.
[341:13.00]Thanks, both of you.
[341:14.94]Fugleberry is my favorite character.
[341:17.18]Says, man up with IcyHot250.
[341:19.00]Thank you.
[341:23.71]Thank you.
[341:25.59]CadBTV, thanks for the 250.
[341:28.21]I believe you can do this.
[341:29.53]I'm sorry you think my support is fake grass.
[341:32.17]But I still believe you can beat this game, little buddy.
[341:36.45]Fugles, thanks for 250.
[341:37.61]Legolas is a prince.
[341:38.63]He's only here to look good.
[341:40.85]He's good with a... He's got the good bow.
[341:42.59]He's good with a bow.
[341:45.11]Sarah and FP, thanks for the 500 bits.
[341:46.73]Yo, Jeremiah, I can't believe I've stuck around for almost 11 hours and loved every bit of it.
[341:50.27]There was still over two and a half hours after that.
[341:51.93]I'll probably be asleep by the time you read this, but I just wanted to let you know not to... not to something.
[342:01.20]A TurboDriverDev gave 5,000 bits.
[342:05.87]TurboDriverDev, thank you.
[342:12.87]I wake up in Europe and you're still streaming, you're truly insane.
[342:16.65]Thank you, Turbo Driver, for the huge amount of money.
[342:19.83]Sometimes that happens.
[342:20.67]It only happens when I play PlayStation 2 or Dreamcast games.
[342:25.21]And... That's actually kind of bad.
[342:29.65]Because a shitload of things I have back here are... PlayStation 2... games.
[342:35.87]Old games.
[342:36.51]So... I don't know if it's about the old games thing...
[342:41.97]But I got a lot of them behind me.
[342:45.29]So, be careful.
[342:48.54]Gotta be careful.
[342:49.58]Niall Arian says, for 300 bits, Hey, you fucking died, mate.
[342:52.36]Hehe XD.
[342:53.76]Thank you.
[342:55.02]Judge Mortis, 1000 bits, Jerma police, for the love of God, turn it off and go to bed.
[342:58.56]Your mother and I can hear your damn tears through the wall.
[343:01.43]Go to sleep.
[343:04.17]Uh, Judge Mortis, you don't know my father's a judge?
[343:07.85]Thank you, Judge.
[343:08.91]Thank you, thank you, Dad.
[343:14.13]Nile Orion, again, 300 bits.
[343:15.61]Jerma has ascended.
[343:16.53]Fox Club, 49 or 500 bits.
[343:21.43]Jerma, I went to bed for six or seven hours.
[343:23.82]Had a dream you accidentally put porn on the stream during a break.
[343:27.16]Woke up sweating for some reason and then saw you were still streaming.
[343:29.70]I don't know.
[343:30.86]What's with the sex dreams people have of me putting sex on my stream?
[343:39.00]There has to be some reason why this is happening.
[343:43.28]If more than one person is having subconscious dreams of me having sex on stream or doing porn on stream, what kind of vibe am I giving off?
[343:59.98]What kind of vibe am I giving off?
[344:14.08]It's because people fall asleep in front of your streams and then... Alright, let's get to the end here.
[344:21.17]Bugbear and Frog, thanks for the 500 bits.
[344:23.05]They say congrats.
[344:24.65]250 from Cad.
[344:25.41]I hear Vigo beat HelmsDeep his first try on Expert.
[344:29.05]Nope.
[344:31.23]And then finally from a few nights ago, we had $50, 5000 bits from Swivel.
[344:33.94]Thanks for the 5k bits.
[344:40.89]thanks for the longest stream Jerma love you man what's the software that you edit your voice with uh software is it's not software at all it's hardware it is a go xlr I just got it it's pretty fun you can do all kinds of cool stuff with it you can do all kylo ren what do you mean hold on kylo ren

[345:14.93]Wait, wait.
[345:21.17]Kylo Ren?
[345:24.88]Do you feel it?
[345:26.92]I know you did.
[345:31.06]It's in a BB unit.
[345:32.56]It's in a BB unit.
[345:38.18]It's in a BB unit.
[345:43.27]We need to find those droids, find where he is, and then get that... I can't say anything that might possibly be a character's name or anybody that's in the story at all.
[345:58.15]Because that could be somebody will say a spoiler in chat and then they'll get banned.
[346:03.29]So tell me, Ray.
[346:05.04]Fuck, I just said your name.
[346:06.60]Therefore, I just ruined everything.
[346:09.18]So tell me, where is that droid?
[346:15.66]Oh, it's... It's in a baby unit.
[346:18.72]You ruined it.
[346:43.42]Why is the BB unit funny?
[346:47.38]Is it?
[346:47.62]I'm out?
[346:49.32]I don't particularly think so.
[346:51.29]Do a beatboxes Kylo Ren?
[346:59.43]Where is it?
[347:01.59]Oh, I know.
[347:02.95]I know you know.
[347:03.81]See, the thing is, I see it.
[347:10.68]I've always seen it.
[347:11.94]I've always known.
[347:24.35]Only one beatbox.
[347:25.93]He can only do one.
[347:26.79]Now I've turned into Bugleberry.
[347:28.11]Oh, you can tell when it's Bugleberry.
[347:31.17]Oh, and my hands come up.
[347:33.81]Oh, and he doesn't Jim Carrey.
[347:35.07]Oh, I, oh.
[347:42.07]Bugleberry just is Kylo Ren.
[347:49.90]Minus 3,000 viewers because you said the name Bugleberry.
[347:57.90]He's lost his fucking mind.
[348:00.72]Viewers dropping.
[348:02.12]Oh, no.
[348:02.76]Oh, whatever.
[348:03.36]Well, I do.
[348:03.93]Hold on.
[348:04.19]It's going to be a little bit more ridiculous than this.
[348:07.65]And, you know, the thing is, all you have to do
[348:12.45]Alright, let's do an experiment.
[348:13.43]Let's do an experiment.
[348:14.49]If I title the stream Bugleberry Reads Bits, will a thousand people leave?
[348:25.79]Do you think so?
[348:26.23]I actually don't want to do that experiment.
[348:31.20]What the fuck were we doing?
[348:34.04]Oh, right.
[348:35.20]Kylo Ren.
[348:36.30]Hold on, what does this one do?

[351:23.91]They say, please watch.
[351:27.31]Am I supposed to be short?
[351:28.77]I saw this already.
[351:31.11]It was, oh, oh, very funny.
[351:36.70]Hey, Toy!
[351:37.94]Croak!
[351:38.44]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[351:39.32]I've had a long history of word surgery due to my needlessly broken bladder, which just recently started to heal.
[351:44.25]Hope whatever it is you're going through finds an end soon and you find relief soon enough.
[351:48.21]Me too.
[351:50.37]It's starting to be just something that I always constantly have to think about.
[351:56.42]And...
[351:58.19]It's just annoying, right?
[352:00.02]Nobody wants to ever have a medical issue or a problem that you don't know what is the actual problem.
[352:07.07]But I'm going down the road of knowing what it is.
[352:13.40]And trying to obviously I have to figure out what kind of treatment or solution I want to do.
[352:18.40]Do I want to have surgery on my hernia? Do I want to just get that out of the way and just do it? Because I have one and it might be contributing to some of these problems.
[352:27.00]Do I want to get an injection in my rib cage to do a nerve stop some of the nerve problems, right? From the whatever - the inflammation in my rib cage.
[352:34.00]Do I want to do those things? And when am I going to do those things? How am I going to do those things?
[352:40.79]Uh what am I gonna just schedule out like now? Do it now?
[352:45.79]I don't know, because I was told that the hernia that I have is not really big enough to need to do surgery on it yet.
[352:59.79]It's kind of at the wait and see because it's not that- it's not huge.
[353:10.93]It's compact. Yes, it is.
[353:15.00]What do you mean yet?
[353:16.00]Um hernias are the- hernias can get worse.
[353:20.00]This could be something that's been developing in my stomach and esophagus for years and it could just get worse - you're throwing up softball jokes, yeah I know.
[353:31.00]You set it up we knock it- please explain this in the Trump voice.
[353:41.17]Uh uh. Oh we are all here in this beautiful- wait that's not correct.
[353:50.17]Uh let me- excuse me. Let me tell you something, first of all, no, first of all-
[353:55.17]Why is it so low?
[353:59.17]It's Kylo Ren.
[353:05.17]Excuse me. Let me- oh god...
[354:14.15]It's not- listen.
[354:16.15]It's not- it's not a big deal.
[354:19.34]I just have a small hernia.
[354:21.04]The hernia is big enough to be a problem, but it's not really a problem.
[354:25.50]It's a little large.
[354:28.26]It's not really... It always goes back to Bugleberry.
[354:37.81]So we had 200 hernias.
[354:42.70]all of them traded all of them every single one yeah that's right yeah yeah yeah he does this sometimes he looks back yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah meow what's the most up thing I can do with this let's see
[355:23.60]Stop doing that.
[355:33.98]There's a lot of cool things you can do with this thing.
[355:36.20]That's actual worse sound?
[355:38.82]You're freaking out my cat.
[355:42.10]Can I bark?
[355:42.98]Hold on.
[355:56.47]You woke up my dog.
[355:59.13]Why did we do this?
[356:00.37]What happened?
[356:00.99]What the fuck did somebody say?
[356:04.41]What happened?
[356:05.23]Am I just like flashed?
[356:07.39]We're supposed to be reading.
[356:08.77]What happened?
[356:11.15]Thank you.
[356:11.65]Oh my god.
[356:13.68]Anyways, yes, I have medical problems.
[356:16.24]Somebody said Trump.
[356:17.74]You said it once and that's all true.
[356:20.30]And now we're here.
[356:21.72]Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning.
[356:28.44]But I wish you good luck with your bladder.
[356:31.25]I'm just trying to figure this shit out too.

[357:37.66]You've been my favorite entertainer on the planet for a whole decade, and I can't thank you enough.
[357:42.49]I love your content, man, and here's to more fantastic streams.
[357:49.07]Thank you so much for the 700 bits.
[357:53.03]I implore you, I implore you, if you have any negative thoughts like that,
[358:01.14]or anything to do with hurting yourself or self-harm or any of those kind of thoughts.
[358:06.68]You don't want to be having those thoughts in the first place.
[358:13.55]I would get in touch with somebody that's a professional that can help you because you never want to let that linger.
[358:22.35]And even if you say that it does, you know, watching these streams helps and laughing here helps you and keeps you from acting on anything.
[358:33.60]You gotta be careful there.
[358:40.66]Please, please, please go at it from a few different avenues.
[358:55.91]If I can elevate your mood a little bit, that makes me really, really happy.
[359:05.97]But just make sure that you're taking the steps necessary to try to get better.
[359:16.71]And sometimes it takes more than one front to do that.
[359:23.11]I wish you the best of luck.
[359:24.57]Thank you so much for the 700 bits.
[359:29.57]And thanks for hanging out.
[359:41.09]Keep on keeping on.
[359:41.79]No shame in getting help.
[359:44.03]That's true.
[359:49.11]Honestly, we should think about mental health the same way we think about if you got hurt.
[359:57.83]You know, if you're handed physical.
[359:59.76]You know what I'm saying?
[360:04.32]It's medical.
[360:05.84]Medical.
[360:09.43]should not be thinking about mental health as oh no no no that's that's like that's completely different it's different no that's way different it's I don't know no no we don't talk about that it's your it's your body everybody it's everybody has a it it's your brain it's your body we gotta we gotta treat it the same way it has to be taken as seriously
[360:37.65]Everyone has a brain.
[360:38.58]Yeah, no, that's true.
[360:44.56]It's different, but it's just as important.
[360:46.94]Yeah, it is.
[360:48.68]But if you go to a colon doctor and you go to a bone doctor, those are completely different.
[361:04.29]They're treated completely differently.
[361:07.86]The tests that are completely different, the way that you're treated is completely different, but it's still medicine.
[361:15.63]It's still treatment.
[361:23.36]And there's this stigma that I really hope that we get over when it comes to how we see mental health and how we view mental health.
[361:38.53]It really shouldn't be there.
[361:40.19]It just should not be there.
[361:45.57]We need to treat the issues that come up in our bodies.
[361:52.16]That's really the end of it all.
[361:53.94]That's really what it should be.
[362:00.48]That's kind of how I feel about that.
[362:05.19]A bone doctor will heal
[362:08.17]Almost said the rest of that.
[362:10.78]Almost said the rest of that.
[362:17.16]But anyways.
[362:18.32]One day we will all be robots.
[362:20.00]And all we have to worry about is rust.
[362:30.68]SJ, thanks for the $2.50.
[362:31.80]Hey, Jerma.
[362:33.69]I've been a fan for a long time and want to share a dream that I had.
[362:37.07]Here we go.
[362:38.57]Where you were hosting a tour across the US with chat on your bus.
[362:42.91]Halfway in a boring state, people convinced you to take a test made by chat.
[362:48.51]You sat down in some first grade classroom and answered questions like, do you think you contribute to society?
[362:58.01]One was, what is your response to baby?
[363:02.08]The answers you could choose were, uh, yeah, or no, no, no.
[363:07.54]You screeched for two minutes and punched a guy.
[363:16.33]What are you guys eating when you watch these streams?
[363:19.85]Alright, do you guys just eat macaroni and cheese before you go to bed?
[363:26.24]What are you eating before you go to bed?
[363:39.46]Jerma is just a scary motherfucker.
[363:42.08]No, but am I though?
[363:43.36]I completely disagree.
[363:50.41]I disagree.
[363:51.13]It doesn't make any sense to me.
[364:05.95]now they're gonna have bad dreams I'm gonna get a message tomorrow hey dude uh I ate like a bowl of mac and cheese and went to sleep and then I had a dream that you went through the computer and you were a monster and you killed me I don't understand why they're having these dreams this must be it must be something they're learning in school
[364:38.55]You probably woke up somebody.
[364:40.37]I know.
[364:40.75]I'm so fucking stupid.
[364:43.75]I just forget that... I forget it's not like five people in a room.
[364:47.31]It's like thousands of people here.
[364:49.59]I forget.
[364:50.23]I'm not... I really do.
[364:51.41]I really do forget that it's not like ten people hanging out in my room.
[365:00.14]It's 2 a.m.
[365:00.96]Eastern.
[365:01.38]Ah, shit.
[365:02.46]Well, good morning.
[365:06.20]I don't know what that was, but it wasn't me.
[365:11.18]Cat Attack, thanks for the 500 bits.
[365:12.40]Hey Jerma, hope everything's going well with the medical stuff.
[365:14.80]I deal with chronic illness myself, so I know every day is a new battle, it seems.
[365:19.10]Don't push yourself too hard for our sake.
[365:21.56]We'd rather you be happy and healthy.
[365:24.28]Also, half of this bit donation must specifically go to Otto, in the form of dog treats for being a brave boy.
[365:29.66]Absolutely.
[365:32.67]Uh, Supper Eyes Surprise...
[365:39.06]surprise everybody surprise 20 community subs from supper eyes he just at dinner time his eyes light up and he's just wow what do you got there mac and cheese a vat of it and he had another part of the name I don't know what it was thank you supper eyes for the 20
[366:09.52]Community subs.
[366:10.56]Thank you.
[366:14.64]What's with you and mac and cheese tonight?
[366:15.92]I'm probably going to eat it when I leave.
[366:18.84]Click link, click link, click, click link.
[366:20.59]That's... Putting teeth that aren't your teeth on an image of you is terrifying.
[366:43.19]Like when you put teeth on something, these are not my teeth.
[366:47.97]And it's scary.
[366:50.65]Because this is kind of what I, I mean, if I did that, you know, it would look like this.
[366:57.49]But this bottom half just is all wrong.
[366:59.82]It's just not my teeth.
[367:04.16]Oh, now you are going to have nightmares.
[367:06.30]Sorry about that.
[367:07.52]It's contrast Jerma.
[367:14.29]I want that image to go like this.
[367:18.21]Can you hear it?
[367:18.73]Oh, you can't because my... You couldn't even hear that.
[367:23.23]No, I cannot get it to activate.
[367:25.34]I'm clicking my teeth.
[367:27.70]I'm going click, click, click, click, click, click.
[367:29.64]Like this.
[367:30.82]No, you can't hear it.
[367:32.50]My gate is making it so you can't hear it.
[367:38.06]Here, I was going like this.
[367:43.65]I was going... Don't you want that image to do that?
[367:53.70]Just bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite while doing that smile.
[368:07.77]Sure.
[368:08.09]Sure.
[368:14.44]Hey, Miss Lily T, thanks for the $20, 2,000 bits.
[368:18.14]I won't be here when you read these, but I hope you had a good stream, and I hope the chat behaved themselves.
[368:22.99]See you next stream.
[368:25.99]Um, they did.
[368:27.09]No, people, it was fun.
[368:30.07]I just went off on somebody for a short, a short joke that I didn't like, and I went, I got very angry about it.
[368:41.90]It wasn't even that bad.
[368:46.54]It wasn't that bad.
[368:48.38]It was okay.
[368:50.32]Hey, Invader Z, thanks for the 250.
[368:52.42]Yesterday was my birthday, so these are birthday bits for you.
[368:54.82]Just wanted to say thanks for making the past almost a year now amazing.
[368:57.82]I've been having a pretty rough couple months, and you always cheer me up.
[369:02.78]Thank you so much for that.
[369:04.04]Also, just letting you know, my real name isn't Invader Z. It's Invaders.
[369:09.08]You don't pronounce the Z separately, you dingus.
[369:15.82]invaders invader what's the invader invader zim oh right
[369:39.41]Not Invader Z. Invader Zim.
[369:41.99]Yeah, no, no, no.
[369:44.35]That's why I was thinking that.
[369:46.21]Like, I know it's Invader Zim, but like Invader Z, I don't know.
[369:48.53]I figured it was like, oh, Invader Z. I like that show.
[369:51.37]Invaders.
[369:53.01]Thanks for the $2.50.
[369:55.63]Ubermorphpoint.
[369:56.91]Thanks for the $30.
[369:59.39]3,000 bits.
[369:59.63]Jeremy, say trans rights with a question mark.
[370:03.99]Yeah, I think you guys already know my stance on that.
[370:08.05]I've said it before.
[370:11.76]I'll say it again.
[370:12.26]It doesn't matter if you're straight, if you're gay, if you're trans.
[370:16.88]It doesn't matter.
[370:17.42]Do you.
[370:18.26]Do you.
[370:19.40]Do you well.
[370:20.52]Do you very well.
[370:21.78]Nobody else knows how to do you.
[370:23.12]Do you.
[370:23.64]You are you.
[370:24.62]You can do you.
[370:27.55]It doesn't matter who you are.
[370:29.45]Do you.
[370:29.91]Who, me?
[370:37.19]You.
[370:37.27]Do you.
[370:43.81]You're not that person over there.
[370:46.71]You're not that person over there.
[370:49.95]That person over there, you are your own person.
[370:58.70]Me?
[370:58.96]That's a Jump King inspirational speech.
[371:04.82]No, just do you, because you're the only one that knows how to do it.
[371:09.02]That's pretty much it.
[371:12.46]That's all I really have to say about it.
[371:17.36]Do the voice?
[371:17.92]Which one?
[371:25.98]You gotta figure that's probably weird for people to hear.
[371:29.04]When they just don't know what's coming.
[371:31.17]It's just like... Oh, okay.
[371:34.33]He pressed the button again.
[371:36.15]I want to go to fucking bed.
[371:45.15]Bone Jackal, thanks for 500 bits.
[371:47.53]Hello, Twitch.
[371:48.09]This is Jeremy's Doctor.
[371:49.17]I'm excited to announce that Jeremy and I will be collaborating on a world's first interactive livestream.
[371:54.85]Twitch does a colonoscopy.
[371:56.68]You can catch us live January 23rd on the official Vsauce Twitch page.
[372:02.06]Hope to see you there.
[372:04.80]Don't do that.
[372:05.68]Wait.
[372:06.72]23rd.
[372:07.32]Oh, shit.
[372:07.64]That's coming up.
[372:09.30]The day of death, too.
[372:12.32]I gotta be careful.
[372:14.59]I actually really do.
[372:15.37]What am I doing on the 23rd?
[372:16.19]Alright.
[372:19.75]I was going to eat mac and cheese.
[372:24.23]Thanks for the 500 bits, though.
[372:25.65]That stream is not happening.
[372:28.95]Thank you, Fredolschlitz.
[372:31.47]Fredolschlitz with the 400 bits.
[372:33.51]Jerma, is community content night still going to happen on Saturday?
[372:35.74]Or are you going to do something else?
[372:38.96]No, what will probably end up happening is I'm going to do Rhythm Heaven tomorrow.
[372:43.64]See you.
[372:45.54]We'll do Community Content Night EU on Saturday.
[372:49.58]And then probably, I would say Monday or... I have to talk to Joel and see what he's doing on Monday or Tuesday.
[373:01.33]Because that would fit into... Because I got a lot of stuff going on this weekend, too.
[373:05.31]The reasons why I'm doing EU streams is because I got a lot going on.
[373:10.18]There's people coming in to visit.
[373:14.49]There's a couple other things I have to take care of in real life.
[373:18.59]So, I got a lot going on.
[373:23.35]We'll see.
[373:23.63]I'm going to see what his schedule is like.
[373:29.00]But, we're good to go for tomorrow and Saturday, for sure.
[373:32.70]Are you going to have a go back to Satterdoss?
[373:38.64]Oh, I'm not sure it'll be on a specific day.
[373:41.54]But it's just kind of there.
[373:42.58]Hey, Wolfgang, thanks for the 500 bits.

[375:15.29]Anyway, have a good one.
[375:16.39]I think so.
[375:18.06]I think I did come back a few days after that.

[376:19.14]Stop doing that now.
[376:21.20]Don't do that anymore.
[376:24.30]Spell it.
[376:25.10]N-Y-A.
[376:25.96]I have to apologize for this too, but I unintentionally did this.
[376:38.59]I very much intentionally did the I-Y-Y one, right?
[376:42.26]But this is unintentional.
[376:43.22]I had to apologize for what I didn't mean to do.
[376:51.17]This is worse than the other one.
[376:54.48]Oh, whatever.
[376:54.90]Hey, Silent Serenity, thanks for the $2.50.
[376:57.36]Furiously moves windows around.
[377:00.42]I don't know what that means.
[377:03.12]Cad, BTV, $2.50 from Cad.
[377:04.93]Hey, man, sorry to hear you got hit by a bus.
[377:06.41]I really hope you recover quickly, though I can't help but think it is your fault for being too short for the bus driver to see you.
[377:15.69]Get the fuck out of here.
[377:17.37]Untryhard, thanks for the 100 bits.
[377:19.66]He fucked it up.
[377:20.56]100 bits.
[377:20.76]He fucked it up.
[377:21.26]But I have to say it.
[377:21.88]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say, Ryan, you need to cancel your yearly $400 Survey Monkey membership.
[377:28.14]Yeah, I know.
[377:34.66]Hey, the PC int.
[377:36.44]Just kidding.
[377:37.16]It's the point.
[377:38.22]I remember getting corrected last time.
[377:40.85]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[377:41.63]They say, I'm listening to your stream while doing homework and the music is gorgeous.
[377:44.95]Hope you're feeling okay.
[377:46.41]I know stressful and exhausting MRIs can be when I heard you were doing this.
[377:50.69]I'm surprised you even streamed today.
[377:53.06]Hope you got some well-deserved rest soon.
[377:54.50]By the way, what time were you born?
[377:56.66]Nothing creepy.
[377:57.46]Laughing my ass off.
[378:02.02]Hey, when were you born?
[378:03.54]I'm just laughing my ass off.
[378:07.60]Uh, no, I just like astrology.
[378:09.04]I like looking into people's charts, casually.
[378:13.08]See what's going on.
[378:14.74]Oh, you guys, yeah, if you know, I don't know, actually, I don't even know what time I was born.
[378:17.38]I think it was in the night.
[378:20.14]I think it was like 9 o'clock.
[378:22.58]9 p.m.?
[378:25.68]I know it was 9 p.m.
[378:28.85]9 p.m.
[378:29.13]or maybe like 9.45, I don't know.
[378:32.29]Trying to get the star chart.
[378:34.67]Yeah, but I don't know if I want you to have that information.
[378:38.29]I don't want you to look up my star chart and it's, oh, there's going to be some problems this week for Jeremy.
[378:48.87]You're going to know things that I don't.
[378:57.04]Someone's going to get all this info, and they're going to do a full chart and a full the week coming up, and they're going to give a bit message saying, hey, dude, don't play pool for the next week.
[379:11.18]Something bad will happen.
[379:12.38]I'm just like, what the fuck?
[379:16.96]Dude, I just want to tell you, don't eat anything green for the next three days.
[379:22.43]Oh, okay.
[379:25.74]I guess I... The charts.
[379:29.02]The charts said it.
[379:31.66]You don't?
[379:32.00]Anyways, I eat plenty of greens.
[379:33.14]I love fucking avocados.
[379:34.58]I love shredded iceberg lettuce.
[379:38.99]I love shredded iceberg lettuce.
[379:41.65]Which is 85% water.
[379:47.39]And then weird gross fibers and it doesn't do anything.
[379:50.65]I also like cabbage.
[379:52.23]No, I don't.
[379:52.59]That's a lie.
[379:54.01]I like, um...
[379:56.82]Spinach.
[379:57.58]I do love spinach.
[380:03.52]Shredded lettuce with mayonnaise and chicken sandwich.
[380:10.34]Yeah, I think so.
[380:12.02]I think so.
[380:13.26]Yeah, I do.
[380:17.85]Somebody said gross.
[380:22.13]Don't make me angry.
[380:26.73]You would love me when I'm angry because the Jump King stream is one of the top streams I've ever done.
[380:33.85]So go ahead, get angry.
[380:37.67]I had the highest retention rate per viewer on that stream than anything I've ever done before.
[380:47.68]Also made that one up too.
[380:49.50]Hey, Mr. Dask.
[380:51.68]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[380:55.49]Is this enough to cover the guild charter?
[380:59.30]What?
[381:00.62]I thought I already paid for it, but you kept asking again and again to cough it up, whereas I couldn't sell my strongest potions around here.
[381:06.88]I hope this isn't because of my refusal to sell them to you.
[381:10.34]My strongest potions would kill a dragon, let alone a man.
[381:13.00]Well, that's... I'm sorry to hear that.
[381:17.49]I did not... I have nothing to do with this.
[381:18.65]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[381:21.52]Peaceful Hayley, thanks for the 250, Peaceful Hayley.
[381:23.58]Hey Jeremy, hope you, Otto, and Kim are well.
[381:25.72]Hope Otto's surgery went well and your MRI, I'm sure it did.
[381:29.16]I usually have more to say, but I got nothing.
[381:31.18]Just hope you have a- There's no music.
[381:33.34]Just hope you have a good night.
[381:36.94]Thank you, Peaceful Hayley.
[381:41.98]I know what the video is.
[381:45.98]If you have a YouTube account...
[381:51.29]that was created over the last 10 years you've seen the video does that video have how many views does that video have like 600 billion six million oh that was wrong okay
[382:19.70]Alright, we're almost done here.
[382:20.42]We have, uh, Niece.
[382:21.98]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[382:23.08]I want you to use my money to take Kim on a romantic date to McDonald's and only order from the dollar menu.
[382:28.61]Kim, do you want to go to McDonald's?
[382:36.79]Like, actually right when this is over, you want to go to McDonald's?
[382:45.63]That's five.
[382:46.29]That's five bucks.
[382:49.89]You know, you can't scoff at five bucks, man.
[382:51.95]It's five bucks.
[382:54.98]I love McDonald's.
[382:59.04]I love McDonald's.
[383:00.14]I do.
[383:08.14]I would rather eat at McDonald's than most places because they got the Big Mac and nobody else has the Big Mac.
[383:14.35]The Big Mac is the best.
[383:15.71]It's just, I love that thing.
[383:19.11]I get the same order every time I go to McDonald's.
[383:22.68]And you're going to think I'm disgusting.
[383:25.06]But if I'm hungry, and I want to just eat, you know what I'm saying?
[383:29.88]E-A-T.
[383:32.72]Go to McDonald's, and I think I'm going to change the screen.
[383:38.19]Go to McDonald's, you get a number one.
[383:40.63]And I don't really drink that much.
[383:41.93]I try not to drink a whole lot of soda.
[383:43.41]I get a bottle of water.
[383:45.97]I get a bottle of water, number one, with a good big fry.
[383:54.05]That's one.
[383:55.94]I then get... I'm naked right now.
[384:02.60]This is me being naked.
[384:03.70]I get two McChickens.
[384:08.18]For me.
[384:08.85]Those are mine.
[384:12.07]And then...
[384:15.28]A 10-piece nugget that I share with somebody.
[384:27.59]This is a troll.
[384:28.23]It is not a troll.
[384:34.39]So I eat probably like four or five chicken McNuggets.
[384:39.06]I eat the full Big Mac.
[384:40.32]I eat the McChicken.
[384:46.81]And I eat the second McChicken.
[384:48.05]Now, that order does not happen every time.
[384:56.11]Delete the Big Mac.
[384:57.84]And I typically will do two McChickens and the 10-piece.
[385:04.18]Yes, it does.
[385:05.20]No, it doesn't.
[385:06.96]I gotta backtrack Barry this one, I think.
[385:16.38]The 10 piece is a waste of money.
[385:17.52]The 20 piece is 50 cents more.
[385:22.90]He eats this every day.
[385:27.07]That would be so awful.
[385:28.27]Alright, let's keep going.
[385:30.21]But McDonald's is great.
[385:31.65]I mean, I like Wendy's.
[385:32.45]I mean, I don't know if this means anything, but the last time I had Burger King, I got a cold.
[385:38.26]Does that mean anything?
[385:39.76]I don't know.
[385:40.68]I like Burger King, but the last time I ate it, I got a cold.
[385:44.72]That's just true.
[385:45.18]That's, that's, I don't, maybe, it could be not even correlated.
[385:48.34]But it happened.
[386:09.17]That's what the star chart said.
[386:17.08]No, I haven't eaten... Burger King... Alright.
[386:21.00]Burger King sucks.
[386:23.42]Let's be honest.
[386:24.98]Be honest with us and yourself.
[386:26.62]Burger King sucks.
[386:29.26]But... Sometimes you just want it.
[386:34.51]The long chicken.
[386:36.37]The original chicken sandwich.
[386:39.41]I crave that sometimes.
[386:41.03]I'm just like, you know, I want long chicken.
[386:42.51]That sounds good.
[386:46.29]But it's just gross.
[386:48.25]It just is.
[386:50.03]And I think they know that too.
[386:53.93]But I'm not sure they care very much.
[386:55.76]Because they're still one of the big three.
[386:57.88]They still do.
[387:00.68]McDonald's is kind of like that too.
[387:06.56]Long chicken.
[387:07.44]Yeah, you'll get a long chicken.
[387:10.14]It's... Okay.
[387:12.74]Burger King has this thing called the Original Chicken Sandwich.
[387:17.92]If you order a chicken sandwich from Burger King, you are ordering a regular... Oh yeah, it's a patty.
[387:24.99]It's our crispy chicken sandwich.
[387:26.55]It's not the long chicken.
[387:30.57]They don't want you to order the long chicken anymore, even though it's better.
[387:33.32]They want you to order the tender crisp patty with bacon and ranch sauce.
[387:39.38]No, get the long chicken.
[387:40.18]It's the only one that's good.
[387:48.15]Burger King.
[387:51.14]Long chicken.
[387:54.62]There it is.
[387:56.94]Thank you.
[387:57.86]The long chicken.
[388:01.30]It's this thing.
[388:07.98]I always feel like if I look up a fast food burger and I save the image to my desktop, I'm going to get a virus.
[388:12.78]Don't you think that's the easiest fucking way to inject like a Trojan in somebody's computer?
[388:18.57]Seriously.
[388:18.95]I feel like that's so simple.
[388:26.31]Like, I hope that's not happening.
[388:34.50]It's this thing.
[388:40.41]That's the BK Long Chicken.
[388:41.61]It's the only thing on the menu worth ordering anymore.
[388:53.15]Speaking of viruses, make sure you update your Windows 10.
[388:55.37]Why, is there something in the wild right now?
[389:03.44]You've never seen that?
[389:04.28]Yeah, because they don't want you to order it.
[389:09.06]But they, like, hide it on the menu or something.
[389:10.90]It's like, oh, no, we don't want you to get that.
[389:12.50]We want you to get the tender crisp.
[389:18.30]Oh, we want the chicken zinger burger.
[389:23.74]the fuck is this this is a real what is it what even is this sandwich chicken royale no alright let's finish the bits up I'll be left tomorrow morning with some wee just some normal guy thanks for the two thousand bit donations
[389:49.08]Yes, you will see Return of the King on this stream.
[389:51.58]Guaranteed.
[389:52.52]Well, yesterday I was reading my microeconomics book.
[390:10.22]And it talked about how while it is cheaper to do an oil change yourself, it is more beneficial to pay someone else to do it because of comparative advantage.
[390:18.70]Instead of charging your oil, or instead of changing your oil for 15 minutes, spend that time perfecting your comedy because it makes you happier and wealthier.
[390:27.07]Remember IQ, he was right all along.
[390:30.15]I know.
[390:31.97]I know.
[390:35.00]Thanks for the reassurance.
[390:36.06]Appreciate it.
[390:37.26]AB Joe, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[390:40.84]A lot of $50 drops over the last few days.
[390:44.40]Thanks, guys.
[390:46.00]Hello, Jermbo.
[390:46.98]Good to see you again.
[390:47.66]Glad your MRI went okay.
[390:49.86]So when are you going to rename the channel points to BaldCoin?
[390:53.36]Thought that one was a no-brainer.
[390:55.60]Much love from one human to another human.
[390:57.77]Keep it up.
[390:59.51]I will.
[391:00.93]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[391:04.87]Uh, because, because crypto was like a thing.
[391:07.53]You know, it still is, by the way.
[391:10.05]It still is.
[391:10.93]But that was the big ride up to 20k and it was kind of a thing.
[391:17.69]It was, it was, it's a little, bald coin's a little outdated.
[391:20.65]It is a little dated.
[391:26.50]Blueberry Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[391:27.70]Hey, Jerma, couldn't catch the Lord of the Rings stream last week, so I'm super glad I could catch this one.
[391:32.06]It's a lot of fun.
[391:33.44]But, you can bet your sweet, compact gnome ass that I'm not gonna miss the Rhythm Heaven Fever stream tomorrow.
[391:42.09]That game is one of my favorites, and I guarantee you will have a great time with it.
[391:45.81]By the way, do you know the best method of getting pog stains pog stains out of the carpet?
[391:52.63]Sorry, the wink made me pog a little more than I was...
[391:57.03]Oh, yeah.
[391:59.62]Thank you.
[392:01.36]Throw it away.
[392:04.70]Hey, Cad.
[392:05.08]Thanks for the 250, Cad.
[392:06.04]BTV.
[392:06.80]Look here, chump.
[392:07.46]I'm an old Diablo II pro.
[392:08.92]You couldn't last half as long as I could in hardcore.
[392:12.73]I'm probably going to lag in the first 10 minutes and die by a stray arrow.
[392:18.05]So, that's just what happens in that game.
[392:23.05]Let's get the credits on the screen.
[392:24.96]I haven't seen these in a while.
[392:27.73]And they are fast.
[392:30.72]The stream is still hovering over 10,000 subs.
[392:34.26]Still.
[392:38.80]Almost a fold.
[392:40.72]More than two weeks later, there's still more than 10,000 people subbed to the channel.
[392:45.72]Which is crazy.
[392:49.99]Thanks for sticking around.
[392:51.27]Thanks for subbing.
[392:57.75]Much love to all of you.
[393:04.01]And then let's finish up the bits we had.
[393:05.23]Hillsint for the 500 bits.
[393:07.07]They say, I miss Travis jermaPluto.
[393:08.99]We'll go back.
[393:11.14]We're going to do all of them.
[393:12.56]I'm going to do two.
[393:13.56]I'm going to do Travis Strikes again.
[393:14.88]And I'm going to do three.
[393:16.98]So don't worry.
[393:17.72]We'll do them.
[393:19.80]There's a lot to do.
[393:21.54]I'm just busy.
[393:23.24]Trying to do as much as I can.
[393:25.23]In the time that I have.
[393:29.04]Don't worry.
[393:30.38]Hey, Mimi!
[393:30.98]Thanks, Mimi, for the 400 bits.
[393:32.48]Thank you to Quarterdime for the 200 bits.
[393:35.74]He got it wrong again.
[393:37.28]It's 250, Jeremy.
[393:38.62]But you gotta read it now.
[393:39.40]They say the problem with mental health is that people are often mentally unwell to treat their mental illness.
[393:47.50]It's like if the solution to a broken leg was to travel to the hospital on foot.
[393:55.16]I think the...
[393:58.58]The issue is trying to get there before it gets there.
[394:04.73]It's hard to do.
[394:15.01]Gravity Strikes again is interesting for referencing Suda's other work, but it's probably the worst No More Heroes game.
[394:19.99]Not terrible, but still.
[394:23.33]But what I mean is, like you said, if you have a broken leg and you want to walk to the hospital on foot,
[394:30.46]Yeah, you would never do that.
[394:33.48]But it's harder to... It's harder to not get to that state with mental illness.
[394:42.78]Because it's not something that anybody can see.
[394:45.76]Right?
[394:46.18]It's not something that anybody can... Oh, that person has a broken leg.
[394:50.66]Everybody knows that.
[394:51.67]They can see that.
[394:55.57]So it's harder to do.
[395:02.10]And it can stay... You mentioned broken legs.
[395:07.40]A broken leg is a broken leg and it has to be treated immediately.
[395:10.36]Immediately.
[395:13.58]Something like depression or mental health problems, they can stay dormant for a long time.
[395:20.43]And they can slowly build up and over time, years get worse and worse.
[395:28.13]And it's trying to find that spot
[395:31.50]Where you haven't, like you say in quotes, have the broken leg.
[395:38.49]Over time.
[395:44.25]It's tricky, though.
[395:45.69]It is very tricky.
[395:51.94]We had those 20 community subs from SupperEyes.
[395:57.44]Thank you, SupperEyes.
[395:58.34]A lot of subs.
[396:00.34]Thank you.
[396:03.23]How do you guys pronounce co-op Joop?
[396:05.06]Like that.
[396:07.58]Hey, Gillette.
[396:08.32]Thanks, Gillette, for the $2.50.
[396:09.16]I've been struggling a lot with addiction and depression, and watching your streams and VODs has helped me a lot for these times.
[396:14.80]I was having a pretty rough day until I watched today.
[396:16.60]Thank you for everything.
[396:21.61]Yeah, it's the same stuff we were talking about before.
[396:28.03]Same boat.
[396:33.47]Addiction, depression, anxiety.
[396:37.37]It's the same boat, but different paddles.
[396:40.33]You know what I mean?
[396:41.07]They're all in the same realm.
[396:46.19]And how to treat them, there's a lot of different ways that people would say is better or worse.
[396:59.50]But hopefully, you know, over time, you can figure it out.
[397:05.32]The necessary help and the necessary support group, right?
[397:09.24]Because everybody needs it.
[397:17.67]I'm going to be stealing that analogy.
[397:19.17]Well, it's free.
[397:22.17]It's free.
[397:23.97]You can have it.
[397:27.11]Thank you, Gillette.
[397:29.51]I wish you luck with your addiction and your depression.
[397:36.36]Not something to be taken lightly, of course.
[397:40.00]Thank you.
[397:41.68]Good luck.
[397:45.24]Just some normal guy gave 400 bits.
[397:47.93]Hey, Jerma, the whole talk about mental health made me want to say this.
[397:50.67]With bits to anyone who has any mental problems or knows someone who does.
[397:55.07]I had a friend long ago who did commit suicide, and it killed me inside that he didn't talk to me before he did it or said anything.
[398:01.69]Just know that if you are suffering with mental problems, there's always someone there you can talk to who loves you.
[398:07.99]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[398:16.06]The best thing that you really can do if you really think that you have
[398:21.88]These kind of terrible thoughts that, you know, you think to yourself, I shouldn't be having these.
[398:26.24]This is... This is not good.
[398:28.92]This is not good.
[398:33.16]You got to reach out to somebody.
[398:37.38]And hopefully that person is somebody that's equipped to help you.
[398:47.88]Call the hotline if need be.
[398:49.11]Call the hotline therapy.
[398:53.98]And try just day to day to... I mean, it's really easy for me to sit here and go, well, just try to make yourself feel better with small things, little things.
[399:06.07]While you try to get the help that you need.
[399:13.09]Try to find things that make you happy.
[399:16.17]Not things that make you unhappy.
[399:19.21]I've talked about it a few times for me.
[399:22.49]Whenever I feel bad, and I felt... I felt pretty bad over the last couple decades.
[399:30.16]You know, everybody can get some type of, you know, feeling down.
[399:35.40]And not feeling like things are going well.
[399:37.14]And I think I've made even videos on this.
[399:42.21]I got happiness and I sought happiness by making other people happy.
[399:50.63]I wanted to make somebody else's life easier.
[399:55.54]I wanted to make somebody else laugh.
[399:56.68]I wanted to watch somebody be excited about something.
[400:01.14]That made me feel good.
[400:02.50]Showing somebody something.
[400:03.53]Caring about something.
[400:04.39]Making somebody part of a conversation.
[400:08.61]What do you think about that?
[400:09.53]And see what they say.
[400:11.79]That's how I always tried to get myself out of potential ruts that I was in.
[400:14.93]Was trying to make other people happy.
[400:16.97]Because in my mind, if I couldn't make myself happy, I could make other people happy.
[400:22.39]And in return, that helped me.
[400:24.49]That made me happy.
[400:26.66]In sort of a rebound way.
[400:30.10]Same thing with animals, too.
[400:32.60]Like I said previously, I worked... I volunteered at an animal shelter, and it was just... It made me feel good.
[400:39.56]It just made me feel good.
[400:44.02]Because helping other people, or helping other things, it actually... It does it, it does it, at least it does it for me.
[400:55.81]Like, when... When somebody says something... Like, when I'm done streaming, and I look back, and I look at some of the things people are saying, and the comments, and the Reddit threads, and some of the memes and shit that people say...
[401:11.13]If people say, oh, that was fun.
[401:14.05]That was really fun stuff.
[401:15.93]I had a great fucking time.
[401:16.97]That was a great stream.
[401:19.15]I'm just like, alright, that's fucking exactly what I'm looking for.
[401:22.46]You have to kind of find your own ways to fight.
[401:28.58]Your own ways to battle it.
[401:31.80]Everybody's different.
[401:38.04]Do I read the 4chan threads on you?
[401:42.01]No.
[401:43.13]No.
[401:43.29]I don't really read that.
[401:45.40]Not really.
[401:50.68]I hope people... I hope they like me.
[401:53.56]And if they don't, then that's alright.
[401:54.84]You know what I'm saying?
[402:00.05]I have nothing against anybody that somebody... If they do or do not like the things I do, that's alright.
[402:06.59]I'm not gonna be like, how fucking dare you?
[402:10.82]Why don't you like me?
[402:11.84]How could you not like me?
[402:14.14]People have their own shit.
[402:15.54]They have their own things they think are interesting.
[402:20.57]I've read those threads.
[402:21.71]No, they like you.
[402:25.07]Yeah, but it's not everybody though.
[402:28.72]I know that I can't make everybody think that these streams are fun and interesting.
[402:33.04]I know for a fact.
[402:45.35]It's getting windy.
[402:50.67]Did you guys hear that?
[402:51.31]That was like... That was big.
[402:58.11]No, but to finish that thought up, wherever you are hanging out, or message boards, or whatever websites you're on, thanks for even watching it all, even if you don't like it.
[403:16.71]And if you do, then thanks again, because obviously you're still here.
[403:24.24]We have gone over a couple times about the whole, like, oh, like, fuck the haters.
[403:30.08]Fuck, if you fucking got, fuck the haters.
[403:33.71]I don't care.
[403:34.27]Like, I don't, like, if you don't, if you don't like me, then that's fine.
[403:41.85]I find that to be sort of abrasive with that kind of mentality.
[403:59.46]When are you going to go on Oprah?
[404:02.02]Can I get on Oprah?
[404:02.84]Will they get me on Oprah?
[404:04.98]I don't know.
[404:05.50]That sounds like a roundabout way of saying, fuck the haters.
[404:16.06]No, I really... Seriously.
[404:17.69]Seriously.

[404:35.64]The live ones at one point.
[404:36.86]Somebody linked me a thread.
