[20:35.44]They were recording.
[20:36.36]Okay, don't worry.

[24:08.69]I don't think it was.
[24:30.77]I'm staying right in the middle.
[24:33.93]If a car comes, it won't hit me.
[24:38.91]You know what I mean?
[24:45.92]Right in the center.
[24:46.68]They're going to pull some bullshit.
[24:52.36]The cop car is going to be flying down here.
[24:56.63]No, I'm going over here.
[25:00.78]Why is that music happening?
[25:03.20]How come every time I touch that, the music starts?
[25:05.01]Oh my god.

[26:11.63]I'm going to go back and get the backpack.
[26:24.58]Because he's driving that way and he has not turned around yet.
[26:27.74]He hasn't turned around yet.
[26:42.70]It's invisible.

[28:30.18]Why'd you stop?

[31:01.14]F?
[31:05.18]No, no, no, no.
[31:18.43]Where the fuck is this?
[31:19.65]I have to get out of here.
[31:22.71]Oh my god.
[31:29.84]Can't turn it.
[31:37.79]I don't know the combination.
[31:38.63]Alright, I need to know the combination.
[31:39.91]Can I hide in this?
[31:44.94]Can't.
[31:58.68]There's so many places to go.
[32:07.77]You can hide under tables, beds, and in some furniture.
[32:10.99]I gotta practice that.
[32:13.06]How do you do that?
[32:18.98]Crouch?
[32:24.00]I can crouch.
[32:31.97]This door's locked.
[32:32.93]How can I get out?
[32:57.60]There's nothing to hide under!
[33:15.97]I'm alive!
[33:18.75]I'm alive!
[33:20.85]Bite him!
[33:28.35]Oh my god, dude!
[33:29.45]Where do I even go?
[33:30.09]What do I do?
[33:38.20]No, no, no, dude!
[33:39.50]I don't know where to go!
[33:40.14]How do I...
[33:56.76]Home?
[34:13.32]Rust remover!
[34:19.59]What's this?
[34:20.65]Sink?
[34:21.97]I can't reach it.
[34:22.41]There's something in there.
[34:25.51]Dude, how do you hide?
[34:36.10]How do I hide?
[34:37.24]Oh.
[34:40.87]Wait, where the fuck am I?
[34:45.13]Am I?
[34:45.57]Where am I?
[34:46.03]Am I hiding?
[34:47.13]Where am I?
[35:25.58]I want to play the Batman game again.
[35:28.77]I want to ride around and protect Gotham City.
[35:41.65]He's right out here and I'm going to walk right into him when I get out of here and I have like one slash and I'm dead.
[35:50.84]Where is he going?
[35:57.39]This is... Somebody make this into a poster for a horror movie.
[36:05.63]Honest to God.
[36:08.75]Somebody needs to turn this into a poster.
[36:15.26]Like, with the title, like, You're Not Getting Out or something, right?
[36:24.14]What is the title of this movie, do you think?
[36:28.07]You tell me.
[36:41.38]My eyes are all red.
[36:44.26]Why do I look so fucked up?
[36:48.49]Holy shit, man.
[36:49.59]This is fucked.
[37:00.56]I look like Voldemort?
[37:01.66]Okay.
[37:19.51]This is a screencap from Dumb and Dumber.
[37:24.65]I hope people AI expand that one.
[37:26.83]I hope so too.
[37:38.56]He's right.
[37:39.38]He won't leave.
[37:40.83]Just leave me alone.
[37:54.99]Rest remover.
[37:58.13]And...
[38:28.50]He can see through that.
[38:30.20]The knob doesn't turn.
[38:32.12]Maybe I can use something to make the cycle pull it down.
[38:34.80]What?
[38:36.06]What's that?
[38:48.83]Bandage.
[38:49.57]How do I use this?
[38:57.45]How do I use the bandage?
[39:04.97]Is there a save?
[39:09.82]Hide in the box and shimmy out.
[39:11.54]That actually could probably work.
[39:28.04]I hate this game.
[39:29.11]I hate this.
[39:42.93]Right here.
[39:43.39]Okay, so I have a rust remover.
[39:48.21]Something was rusty.
[39:59.42]I don't know.
[40:02.98]Sink was rusty.
[40:04.86]Sink was rusty.
[40:06.06]You know what?
[40:08.46]Scared.
[40:10.84]That's what you want.
[40:14.08]I'm gonna march out here and just start singing fucking John Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[40:23.36]What are you doing?
[40:23.90]No, you're supposed to be scared.
[40:26.24]John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[40:29.56]His name is my name too.
[40:32.90]Whenever we go out, we always shout, here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
[40:40.46]Get in the bathtub quick.
[41:07.35]Where is he?
[41:09.95]Dude, I can't see anything!
[41:34.69]Break this door!
[41:35.81]Break this door!
[41:36.87]Break this door!
[41:37.75]Dude, this game's fucked.
[41:39.21]This game's fucked up.
[41:40.25]That's wicked funny!
[41:48.13]We gotta see this one.
[41:48.89]This one's perfect.
[41:55.46]I don't want to play this.
[41:56.52]I hate this.
[41:59.04]This is a good one, though.
[42:05.17]Wait, come on, come on, come on.
[42:16.44]Why can I not save this?
[42:17.41]This one is so good.
[42:25.14]This is fucking actually one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
[42:29.65]I have to get these on stream.
[42:31.71]Yeah, dude.
[42:37.09]Okay.
[42:38.56]Well, everyone bear with me for a second.
[42:46.14]I got to get these all loaded because these are gold.
[42:48.82]These are actual gold.
[42:52.69]Here's the first one.
[42:54.30]This one's pretty good.
[42:56.94]I will say.
[42:58.46]This one's pretty good.
[43:06.17]They get better.
[43:07.43]They get way better.
[43:09.23]And I mean way better.
[43:12.77]This one... So an AI decided that this is what I was doing.
[43:17.27]Okay.
[43:17.83]Makes sense, right?
[43:19.38]Why would I be this concerned?
[43:27.63]Here's the next one.
[43:41.91]Dinner?
[43:42.23]I'm making dinner?
[43:43.83]And I'm very... This is an oven that I'm shocked at.
[43:55.15]But wait...
[43:56.52]To not even the best one.
[43:58.68]Because the best one is right here.
[44:00.94]And it could be the funniest image I've seen ever on the channel.
[44:03.90]And I mean that.
[44:04.60]This is probably the funniest thing.
[44:05.56]This is probably the funniest image.
[44:07.48]That's come through.
[44:10.37]This is so good.
[44:30.16]Look at how bad that form is too.
[44:32.16]It's so bad.
[44:35.46]This is like the old guy.
[44:36.66]This kind of has to like stay.
[44:57.67]Okay, retry.
[45:02.59]How far am I in the game?
[45:04.52]Not even fucking close, dude.
[45:06.48]I don't think I'm gonna beat this.
[45:12.00]Close the door!
[45:12.70]Close the door!
[45:13.38]Close the door!
[45:14.04]I can't close it.
[45:14.72]Is it open?
[45:15.15]Okay.
[45:22.59]Okay.
[45:26.92]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[45:28.52]I don't think I can play this game.
[45:43.31]Trying to commit this house to memory.
[45:46.85]And he's wicked fast.
[45:48.95]I need to get items and shit.
[45:50.37]No way.
[45:50.75]I'm not going to be able to beat this.
[45:59.59]I'm gonna panic every time he shows up.
[46:07.68]Was there an item down here?
[46:08.72]No, it's back up in the house.
[46:09.64]Alright, this is a good one, too.
[46:16.48]I'm gonna show this one.
[46:18.02]This is also a really good one.
[46:22.47]Like, I just wanna, like, do this for the rest of the stream.
[46:24.61]Like, this is fun.
[46:27.71]Apparently like very, very, very excited at the birthday party.
[46:32.97]I'm very surprised at my surprise birthday party.
[46:42.35]We have my arm.
[46:44.65]What am I holding?
[46:45.35]Is that like a clipboard or an iPad?
[47:04.28]One more and I'm going to move on.
[47:06.30]These are very good though.
[47:08.00]They're very good.
[47:09.88]I feel like chat is going to be chat's favorite.
[47:29.01]I can't play.
[47:29.47]I can't play this game.
[47:31.93]Okay, I'm gonna just be quiet.
[47:32.95]I'm gonna shut up and I'm just gonna- Even if it's scary, I'm just gonna go and I'm gonna play it.
[47:35.95]I don't care.
[47:36.33]Fucking come get me.
[47:37.21]I don't care.
[47:51.73]I can't.
[47:51.99]I gotta- I quit.
[47:53.43]I'm- This is the first time I'm ever quitting a game.
[48:37.23]How do I get out of here?
[48:38.13]I can't hide under the table.
[49:07.42]Oh, Bugleberry Radio.
[49:20.59]I wish we'd just go away for even five minutes.
[49:23.27]He's just camping me.
[50:05.62]You know what I feel like I'm playing?
[50:06.83]And it's a game I never beat and I just rage quit it.
[50:09.85]I was just, I scare rage quit it.
[50:14.30]That grandma game for iPad.
[50:18.62]I couldn't do it.
[50:19.34]And I was like, I'm just fucking uninstalling this.
[50:45.36]What happened?
[50:47.12]Oh, I ran in a circle.
[50:51.54]That was a chicken.
[50:52.70]That was a fucking rooster.
[50:54.86]That was a rooster.
[50:55.62]That was actually a rooster.
[50:58.05]That was a chicken.
[50:58.81]That was like a... What the... Oh, bandage.
[51:01.75]Nice.
[51:02.15]Hide.
[51:03.59]This game's impossible.
[51:06.04]This game is not possible.
[51:06.88]This game is actually impossible.
[51:25.25]Seems to be something in the pipe.
[51:26.25]I can't reach it.
[51:27.29]Okay, that's not rusty though.
[51:29.41]I need like a stick.
[51:37.49]Nothing in there?
[51:39.69]God.
[51:52.84]The valve was rusty, that's right.
[51:54.68]That was down in the basement, right?
[51:58.57]Okay.
[51:59.81]I can't carry any more objects?
[52:01.55]What are you talking about?
[52:05.85]Oh.
[52:09.84]Should I just put... I can't carry any more items?
[52:14.86]Where should I put this?
[52:23.61]Oh, right here.
[52:24.29]I'm going to put it right here.
[52:25.11]I'm going to hide under the bed.
[52:25.99]Okay.
[52:26.11]Put it down right here.
[52:27.73]And put it down...
[52:51.60]Oh, my God!
[53:24.07]A hole.
[53:31.11]Was that a key?
[53:33.01]I got a key of some kind.
[53:34.29]A trunk?
[53:36.05]Can I open this?
[53:36.61]Okay, open the trunk with the key.
[53:42.53]Open the trunk with the fucking key, dude.
[53:46.87]Excuse me.
[53:47.63]Open the trunk with that key right now.
[53:50.61]I can't get my inventory.
[53:51.59]Why?
[53:52.57]My inventory doesn't work.
[53:54.29]Inventory doesn't work.
[53:55.79]Why does my inventory not work?
[53:58.11]Tab.
[53:59.61]Tab.
[54:00.78]It's broken.
[54:08.14]I actually can't use my inventory.
[54:13.30]Yeah, tab, I...
[54:21.85]Tab and I, yeah.
[54:23.29]Doesn't work.
[54:24.13]Tab?

[54:32.78]Oh, god damn it.
[54:33.80]Please, man.
[54:34.50]Don't even... Why is this on fire?
[54:39.42]Oh.
[54:40.57]What?
[54:43.83]What the fuck happened?
[54:46.19]This is why I couldn't... Okay.
[54:47.33]Okay.
[55:05.09]What the hell is happening to me?
[55:06.87]Okay, I can use my inventory again.
[55:09.28]Where's the- Where's the door that I just was at?
[55:12.54]Where's the door?
[55:28.10]Where's the- Where's that door?
[55:34.79]Rust.
[55:40.36]Rust.
[55:42.06]Where's the, where is it?
[55:42.72]Where is, where is it?
[55:51.86]Where is it?
[56:29.96]What happened?
[56:31.46]I just shut down my computer!
[56:32.84]I think I shut my computer!
[56:34.30]I think I shut my computer down.
[56:36.76]I opened the power menu and it shut- Dude, what?
[56:48.53]How do you- I quit.
[56:54.71]I quit this game.
[57:03.91]You start at the beginning every time.
[57:07.69]You start at the beginning every time.
[57:09.51]There's no checkpoints.
[57:45.55]Huh.
[57:51.77]I don't even want to... I mean, these are just weird.
[57:56.63]These are just weird now.
[57:59.76]I'm just going for a speedrun.
[58:01.02]Fuck it.
[58:02.14]I'm going for a speedrun right now.
[58:10.46]Chemicals are upstairs.
[58:25.93]There's too many fucking doors in this house.
[58:27.15]I don't even know where I... Chemicals.
[58:28.37]Got it.
[58:38.38]Cork.
[58:57.37]I mean, I get so lost so easily, I can't play these.
[58:59.53]I need the alarm clock to throw in there.
[59:03.10]Alarm clock?
[59:03.52]Okay, here he comes.
[59:05.78]Okay.
[59:35.68]Where was the alarm clock?
[59:36.60]I don't remember.
[59:37.36]I don't know where I am in this fucking house.
[60:12.58]I don't even know how to get downstairs.
[60:13.90]I'm serious.
[60:14.65]I don't know how to get downstairs.
[60:16.11]I don't know how to get downstairs.
[60:38.32]How are you still chasing me?
[60:39.59]It's impossible.
[60:40.19]You didn't even see me...
[60:52.09]I can't run anymore.
[61:09.86]I can't get away from him.
[61:11.82]He's too fast.
[61:13.34]Dude, you can't get away from this motherfucker.
[61:15.30]You can't get away from him.
[61:16.14]He's so fast.
[61:32.47]I can't see.
[61:33.36]I'm so bad with like permanence and location.
[61:35.80]I can't play.
[61:37.14]I don't fucking give a shit about this game.
[61:40.70]I don't care.
[61:41.16]I leave.
[61:41.68]I'm done.
[61:42.66]I'm done.
[61:43.94]I'm done.
[61:44.46]I give up.
[62:03.51]Isn't there an alarm here?
[62:06.09]Dude, every room looks exactly the fucking same and like he runs so fast and like there's just items fucking sprinkled in every corner and you're gonna take the fucking alarm clock out of this room and then go up there and take the fucking rust pourer and pour that into the chemical and get the chemical and get the key.
[62:46.12]I've gotta hide immediately.
[62:47.16]He's like already in the fucking room and he's gonna grab me out of this canister and he's gonna slash my head.
[63:09.62]Stop!
[63:10.14]Why is he still here?
[63:11.38]He should not be coming back in this room!
[63:34.18]Going upstairs.
[63:36.93]Okay.
[63:42.71]I think I've got every item that I need.
[63:50.57]There's nothing else down here, right?
[63:52.43]I got... The valve is down here.
[63:55.73]I gotta bring... I gotta go all the way upstairs, get the rust remover, and bring it down here.
[64:01.73]I'm gonna try that.
[64:23.40]The problem is I don't even know how to get up.
[64:25.39]I need like a fucking fable 2 breadcrumb trail, dude.
[64:28.23]I like seriously, I can't even know what hallway we're in.
[64:33.43]And he's just right up your ass the whole time.
[64:40.78]And I don't want to turn the light on because it'll attract him.
[64:45.04]See?
[65:13.53]I don't know where to go.
[65:16.45]I can't commit anything to memory because my brain is in a constant state of distress.
[65:21.76]So I can't commit anything to memory.
[65:31.68]Straight across from that weird door is the basement, okay?
[65:38.50]I gotta remember that.
[65:59.55]I need his raw map.
[66:11.94]He's just... He's just... You do... I have to speedrun because the dude is never going to leave me alone!
[66:16.28]Just get out of my way!
[66:17.88]Fuck you, buddy!
[66:20.08]That's fine.
[66:33.44]I quit.
[66:33.88]I quit this game.
[66:36.28]I quit this game.
[66:37.94]Where's the stairs to go up the fucking stairs?
[66:44.98]I quit this game.
[66:50.79]Draw a map.
[66:51.35]Do you want me to draw a map?
[66:53.65]I can't.
[67:02.52]I'm just trying to lose him.
[67:07.71]You can't lose the guy.
[67:09.39]I can't lose him.
[67:21.35]Why is he still right behind me?
[67:23.31]Dude, you can't see in your own fucking house.
[67:26.71]That's horse shit.
[67:52.60]Get it, man!
[67:57.27]Oh, it's right there, right?
[68:04.79]Get out of the fucking way, you huge asshole!
[68:07.75]Dude, what even-
[68:43.22]Rust remover in paint can room, valve in basement, alarm clock in fireplace room, door with hole in the room with the two bedrooms.
[68:49.69]Thank you for the help.
[68:50.31]Alright, I'm just, I'm gonna try this one more time.
[69:04.29]This dude's up your ass the whole game.
[69:08.17]He doesn't go, like, disappear for, like, a minute.
[69:10.77]No, he's just, he's here.
[69:11.87]It's terrifying.
[69:12.59]It's horrible.
[69:14.18]And he's gonna stand here.
[69:15.54]Like a dick.
[69:17.36]I bet you he comes back in the room.
[69:34.31]The alarm clock is random.
[69:40.77]Really?
[69:41.10]That's so horrible.
[70:14.52]Okay, how do I get up the stairs?
[70:20.53]There's a door that leads to another door which leads to the stairs up.
[70:49.76]He's walking by.
[70:55.09]Okay.
[71:06.12]Okay.
[71:08.20]Downstairs is there.
[71:09.22]That means over here...
[71:13.68]There's another door over here.
[71:19.32]I think it's straight ahead.
[71:22.04]Right?
[71:22.64]No.
[71:30.47]Quiet.
[71:36.31]Is he upstairs or downstairs?
[71:37.55]Where is he?
[71:38.01]Is he upstairs?
[71:38.45]I think he's upstairs.
[71:39.77]Is he upstairs?
[71:41.75]Is he upstairs?
[71:58.55]Fuck dude, why?
[72:00.77]Where am I?
[72:01.25]Yeah, go look in here.
[72:07.37]There's a fucking clock in here.
[72:08.99]Oh my god.
[72:30.61]You can lower the... I'm getting Luigi'd.
[72:32.57]Alright, I'm getting Luigi'd.
[72:35.73]This change will be permanent and you will only be able to play again at the real difficulty if you start a new game.
[72:40.87]If you continue without making changes this message will be displayed again if you die again.
[72:44.63]Do you want to lower the enemy difficulty?
[72:49.51]I can't believe I got fucking Luigi'd.
[72:52.12]I can't believe it.
[72:55.87]I'm doing, I don't care.
[72:56.60]I want to see this.
[72:57.40]I want to see how.
[72:59.25]I don't care.
[72:59.69]I don't care.
[73:00.89]I'm getting Luigi.
[73:01.42]I don't even care.
[73:34.15]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[73:36.19]Can you imagine if I die like three more times and it's like, do you want it even easier?
[73:39.59]Clock isn't here.
[74:03.36]I'll help you find her.
[74:04.74]Here we are.
[74:05.12]Let us go.
[74:07.00]Grab your things and play it close at the beginning of the revenge.
[74:12.38]Revenge.
[74:13.25]I've been thinking about the beginning of the revenge.
[74:17.65]Oh, you hate me.
[74:25.49]Dude, get out of here.
[74:43.47]Get the fuck out of here.
[74:44.75]Get out of this hallway.
[74:45.71]Like, get out of this hallway.
[74:50.47]You chump.
[75:04.21]Okay.
[75:09.13]Okay, alright.
[75:09.61]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[75:11.18]Where is it?
[75:39.62]Where's the clock?
[75:40.64]It's coming down here.
[76:06.63]Here it comes.
[76:11.48]You should try Murder House.
[76:12.64]I played Murder House.
[76:13.42]I beat it.
[76:15.16]That was pretty... That was recently.
[76:16.18]Okay.
[76:19.41]I don't know if he's still here.
[76:24.93]Where's... I don't have the clock, though.
[76:26.21]Oh, fuck.
[76:38.22]Can't hide under that.
[77:12.48]Where's the clock?
[77:13.10]I don't know where he is.
[77:21.13]I don't know.
[77:32.39]I don't know.
[77:33.31]I don't know.
[78:05.57]You can't be serious.
[78:07.59]Right when I come out of the fucking hiding, he's now walking around here.
[78:12.67]You can't.
[78:13.41]I'm not even scared anymore.
[78:14.13]You're just making me angry.
[78:15.13]You're just pissing me off.
[78:28.64]I need to hide right now.
[78:29.46]I need to hide right now.
[78:47.30]Here he comes.
[78:50.74]I would love to just jump out of here and jump scare him.
[78:54.02]Grab the sickle out of his hand and just right in his head.
[78:58.67]Don't even.
[78:59.09]You open that and I'm fucking uninstalling the game.
[79:01.65]If you open this cabinet, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[79:03.41]Thank you.
[79:16.60]You still here?
[79:17.30]What are you still doing?
[79:21.56]Okay, he went upstairs?
[79:22.52]I think he's upstairs.
[79:26.24]Alright, Valve time.
[79:31.13]You know what I mean?
[79:32.29]Like they say they're gonna make a game and then it takes like another extra few years.
[79:35.71]Working on Valve time.
[79:37.73]Haha!
[79:48.34]The rust is still dissolving.
[79:49.44]I probably should hide.
[79:57.88]He's gonna come down and go like whatever he says.
[80:16.87]Still dissolving.
[80:20.08]I was sitting here the whole time.
[80:20.93]I don't care.
[80:22.45]There's a raid from where?
[80:24.12]I didn't say raid.
[80:52.81]Okay.
[81:00.76]What does that do?
[81:04.72]Water is already flowing in the pipes.
[81:06.42]I should check the bathrooms.
[81:09.99]Oh, the sink.
[81:12.43]There's a sink that has, right?
[81:14.15]Wherever that is.
[81:19.95]I don't remember where that sink is.
[81:28.29]You look like Kenneth Copeland for a few frames here.
[81:32.40]What?
[81:32.66]Oh my god, my eyes are bugging out of my head.
[81:43.90]Holy shit, my eyes almost come out of my head, out of my socket.
[82:04.45]How do I save this?
[82:12.77]This is a crazy image.
[82:19.39]Watch my eyes.
[82:25.46]That's insane.
[82:29.66]Skeleton for a few frames.
[82:32.74]Alright, back to this.
[82:42.18]Check the bathrooms.
[82:44.62]Alright, he's down here again.
[82:46.22]Wait till he comes.
[82:46.73]He's gonna walk through here.
[82:47.67]Or should I just... just... run for it?
[83:10.84]Where's the bathroom?
[83:24.74]don't sprint it's instantly going to give away with I'm getting speech jammed by butylberry sorry
[83:54.27]Only sprint when he's chasing you, okay?
[84:05.21]Everybody under the table has reached over and just did this out in the hall.
[84:16.14]Okay, I need a bathroom.
[84:31.67]I don't know.
[84:32.05]Is he turning around?
[84:34.09]He's in there.
[84:34.58]Okay.
[84:40.96]He just went up the stairs.
[84:42.36]It's my opportunity.
[84:44.76]My opportunity.
[84:45.26]Opportunity.
[84:45.62]Let's go.
[84:46.30]Don't sprint.
[84:47.08]Bathroom.
[84:58.35]Is he above me or is he over here?
[85:03.70]I think he's above me.
[85:10.64]What is this?
[85:11.10]This is like... I gotta get something to break that open with.
[85:13.57]Bathroom.
[85:13.99]Here we go.
[85:18.21]Oh shit.
[85:36.97]He's right there.
[85:37.63]He's right next to me.
[85:45.50]Where's the bathroom thing that was in the sink?
[85:56.71]It's upstairs.
[85:58.43]Okay.
[86:00.11]I haven't heard him move.
[86:15.17]He's like over here.
[86:36.60]He's up here.
[86:57.05]Oh, I'm dead.
[87:03.08]Oh, I hate this.
[87:04.04]I quit.
[87:25.15]You know what?
[87:25.55]I don't even care.
[87:26.43]It's on easy mode.
[87:28.83]It's on easy mode.
[87:31.15]I'm just going up the stairs.
[87:32.23]I don't give a shit if he hears me.
[87:38.43]I thought he was downstairs.
[87:44.92]Oh my god.
[87:46.30]That was the worst thing ever.
[87:47.90]That was probably the worst thing ever.
[87:52.34]I quit.
[87:54.01]That was the worst thing ever.
[87:55.29]I thought he was downstairs.
[87:56.47]I actually thought he was downstairs.
[87:57.51]I thought he was downstairs.
[88:01.83]I think, well... That hurt my whole body.
[88:10.35]I don't think I can play this.
[88:15.83]Uh, okay.
[88:16.81]You took my advice for three minutes and then you said fuck it and he immediately died.
[88:30.04]Well, he wouldn't get... Okay.
[88:32.14]He wouldn't get away from upstairs.
[88:35.28]I was waiting and waiting and waiting.
[88:36.85]I was hiding under the table and I hear... It's him going up and down the top floor.
[88:42.79]So I'm just like, alright.
[88:43.89]I don't care.
[88:44.75]I'm going up there.
[88:47.50]I'm doing it my way.
[88:49.25]I'm doing it my way.
[88:50.43]Your way is correct.
[88:52.21]My way is stupid, and it's gonna get me killed.
[88:55.10]But I'm going for it.
[89:26.84]Not now.
[89:30.23]Not now.
[89:30.65]Not now.
[89:30.99]Please, not now.
[89:31.47]I'm gonna sneeze.
[89:54.22]No, we're supposed to be doing this my way.
[89:56.39]I got the rust.
[89:56.93]We're going downstairs.
[89:57.73]Turn the valve on.
[89:59.01]Just fucking run upstairs.
[89:59.91]Yeah, what am I doing here?
[90:04.76]This is not my way.
[90:08.36]This is my way.
[90:36.29]Where's the valve?
[90:43.69]This is my way.
[90:44.37]Okay, now I need to go get Clock.
[90:57.50]Hey.
[90:58.60]We're doing it my way.
[91:00.74]Clock is upstair- Clock is up?
[91:02.48]Fireplace.
[91:27.21]The rust is dissolving.
[91:28.25]The sink will be available.
[91:34.69]This is an adventure time bit right now.
[91:38.47]What happened in adventure time?
[91:46.27]Okay.
[91:47.53]So, there's a bathroom up here.
[91:49.89]I gotta fish out whatever's in the sink.
[91:53.91]I then have whatever's in the sink.
[91:55.57]I still need the alarm clock.
[92:01.24]I didn't turn the valve.
[92:02.46]Oh my god, you're right.
[92:03.76]Alright.
[92:06.66]Oh, that sucks.
[92:07.68]I'm in trouble now.
[92:12.78]Oh, that actually sucks.
[92:13.81]I think it's over.
[92:30.28]Close it!
[92:32.30]Close it!
[92:54.66]Is he still here?
[93:03.06]I think he's gone.
[93:03.94]Yeah, he went back upstairs.
[93:05.53]Turn it.
[93:15.61]Okay, now we gotta go all the way upstairs.
[93:17.06]What's up, buddy?
[93:20.30]What's up, buddy?
[93:22.50]What's up, buddy?
[93:30.76]I need the clock.
[93:32.24]He went upstairs.
[93:32.72]I need the clock.
[93:42.29]There's no clock.
[93:42.97]Okay, guys, where's the clock?
[93:46.37]Honestly, where's the clock?
[93:48.75]It's not in here, and I haven't seen it in any other room.
[93:50.79]Just tell me where it is.
[93:51.39]Okay.
[94:00.00]Oh, Raid?
[94:01.04]Oh, Mr. Sark!
[94:03.87]What's up, Sark?
[94:05.87]Thank you, Mr. Stark, for the raid.
[94:06.79]Welcome, everybody.
[94:08.25]I'm currently about to rage quit this game and never play it again.
[94:14.67]You're in the middle of it.
[94:16.32]You're coming in right with that.
[94:17.12]This is probably the 50th attempt.
[94:18.90]I had to put it on easy because I can't do it.
[94:22.46]It's a pretty fun game, I would say.
[94:24.80]I'm about to uninstall it.
[94:28.76]Pretty good.
[94:31.86]Where is the clock?
[94:38.94]It's a wrench.
[94:40.52]It's too hot.
[94:41.50]Are you serious?
[94:42.30]Just grab it quick.
[94:52.06]Gotta get upstairs again, right?
[94:54.40]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[95:02.32]Dickhead.
[95:09.21]There seems to be something in the pipe.
[95:10.39]I can't... It didn't happen?
[95:11.93]It didn't push it up from the water.
[95:26.79]Seems to be something... I can't... How do I use the sink?
[95:32.90]I need the wrench.
[95:34.36]How do I... I need to get water to put the fire out to get the wrench to come up here.
[95:39.09]Okay.
[95:44.69]How do I put the fire out?
[95:46.79]It's the pipe.
[95:49.49]From the tub.
[95:50.11]I need something to hold...
[96:16.36]Okay.
[96:17.84]Find the alarm clock.
[96:18.63]The key you get unlocks a save point.
[96:20.55]Really?
[96:23.61]Paint.
[96:24.01]Cork.
[96:24.35]Cork.
[96:24.71]Cork.
[96:25.43]Is it right here?
[96:38.23]I have something to cut it with.
[96:39.63]I need to get scissors.
[96:42.17]Or scissors.
[96:43.61]But anyway, say thanks to the Sark for the raid.
[96:44.89]Follow Sark.
[96:46.29]He's an awesome dude.
[96:53.61]Get the key.
[96:55.43]The key, alright.
[96:56.87]Just give me a route to take.
[96:58.17]The key is... Give me a route.
[97:02.56]I need a route.
[97:04.14]I gotta go... What's the route?
[97:14.53]Alarm clock, bedroom, fire, key.
[97:16.99]But I don't know where the alarm clock is.
[97:22.03]It's in a random spot, apparently.
[97:23.31]I don't know where the alarm clock is.
[97:26.11]Alarm clock, key, plywood door.
[97:28.15]Where's the clock?
[97:31.77]It's a random spot on the second floor.
[97:39.72]Fuck you, buddy.
[97:40.46]Don't give a shit.
[97:53.25]Not in here.
[98:25.87]Random spawn on the second floor.
[98:30.49]Random spawn on the second floor.
[98:34.37]Where's this dumbass clock?
[98:46.42]Are you shitting me?
[98:49.02]I got the fucking clock.
[98:49.76]I got the clock.
[98:50.24]I got the clock.
[98:50.68]Okay, now we gotta go upstairs.
[98:56.03]Get my bearings.
[99:00.28]It's up.
[99:02.26]Hide.
[99:04.88]Get him to run into the door.
[99:05.80]Get the lock.
[99:08.06]Get the key.
[99:08.72]Come back down here.
[99:09.56]Open up the thing with the boarded hallway.
[99:12.93]And then apparently that's a checkpoint.
[99:23.07]Okay, I'm going for it.
[99:24.51]I'm going for it.
[99:25.20]No, I'm not.
[99:26.12]He's still here.
[99:28.36]Why can't I just press, like, B and get, like, the boom, boom, boom, boom and see him through the wall?
[99:34.99]Every video game has that now.
[99:36.59]Every video game has it.
[99:37.37]Put it in this.
[99:39.58]I'm doing it my way.
[100:07.52]I gotta listen closely.
[100:08.58]Because if it sounds from... Is he up here or is he downstairs?
[100:21.49]I don't know!
[100:23.87]I'm here.
[100:34.62]I made it.
[100:38.56]Okay, give me a second.
[100:40.74]I think he was up here, actually.
[100:41.96]That's terrifying.
[100:43.12]He was.
[100:43.76]He was up here.
[100:44.30]I just didn't see him.
[100:58.05]Okay, so walk, get in there, grab the key.
[101:06.35]downstairs to that plywood thing on the wall, right?
[101:10.47]Open that.
[101:54.35]People dancing is funny.
[102:24.55]Get out of here, man.
[102:25.49]You're making me angry.
[102:27.03]Okay.
[102:36.03]Okay.
[102:39.16]We get this weird cutscene again.
[102:40.52]Yep.
[102:40.94]Okay.
[102:41.34]This is the right.
[102:42.32]Okay.
[102:42.60]Okay.
[102:43.00]Yep.
[103:10.39]Okay, don't get caught here.
[103:13.49]Alright.
[103:16.81]Okay, okay.
[103:17.37]Here we are.
[103:18.99]It's right here.
[103:21.01]Isn't it right here?
[103:23.79]It's right here, right?
[103:24.33]This is it?
[103:29.81]What's wrong?
[103:30.45]What's wrong?
[103:30.99]What's wrong?
[103:31.63]What's wrong though?
[103:32.87]What's wrong?
[103:33.35]I didn't even read what it said.
[103:34.21]What did it say?
[103:41.50]What does it say?
[103:42.70]I couldn't read it.
[103:44.02]I need to remove rust and then... Okay.
[103:50.40]This guy's a real piece of shit, I'll tell you.
[104:02.21]Oh, I'm gonna beat him to death.
[104:14.24]Is he gone?
[104:15.28]I wish the thing would shut up so I could hear.
[104:38.21]Is it open?
[105:05.46]Is the door, the door's open.
[105:06.64]Is it the wrong door?
[105:08.44]That's the wrong door.
[105:15.69]Where is it?
[105:16.35]Where is it?
[105:16.75]It's the hallway in front of that one.
[105:28.65]I just wish it would go upstairs or something.
[105:30.05]Just go away.
[105:30.91]Go downstairs.
[105:31.57]Go upstairs.
[105:32.05]Go anywhere else.
[105:35.63]He walked that over there.
[105:37.99]Well, that way on your screen, because it's flipped.
[105:42.39]He went to the left.
[105:54.33]Go the fuck away.
[105:57.55]Go away.
[106:04.02]Go away!
[106:04.66]Why is he still here?
[106:05.76]Go away!
[106:39.08]Go away!
[106:40.08]Go upstairs!
[106:41.04]Go away!
[106:41.22]Go away!
[107:26.34]I hate this game so much.
[107:27.28]I actually fucking hate this game.
[107:32.84]I'm done with it.
[107:33.70]I'm just done.
[107:34.26]If I die again, I'm over.
[107:35.14]It's over.
[107:48.04]God damn it!
[107:55.41]Okay, open... He's coming down here, and he won't leave me alone!
[107:59.94]He won't leave me be, he won't leave me alone!
[108:15.73]If you die... Hold on.
[108:17.71]If you die before you manage to unlock that padlock, I'm gonna unsubscribe.
[108:24.57]You're not even subscribed.
[108:25.49]I think you don't have to change anything.
[108:28.19]You're not even subbed.
[108:29.99]Come on.
[108:34.02]Is he still down here?
[108:48.10]You fucking piece of shit.
[108:49.78]I swear to God.
[108:54.32]Where's the door?
[108:56.49]Where's the door?
[109:31.15]I've never played this game again.
[109:38.31]This person... That person's been subbed for three months.
[109:40.21]Oh.
[109:46.58]Oh, sorry.
[109:55.24]No, they're not subbed.
[109:57.53]They're not subbed.
[109:58.31]They've been follow... Okay.
[109:59.55]So they aren't subbed.
[110:01.62]I'm waiting till I hear that sound go off and then I'm going back up.
[110:05.78]I'm gonna unsub if you don't get that padlock off.
[110:08.38]Alright, the amount of fucking unsub Andy's in the chat apparently if I can't open this door.
[110:12.44]They said omega low, I got gifted a free sub, omega low.
[110:25.98]Get out of here.
[111:09.03]On your left.
[111:09.65]I know.
[111:10.45]I'm fucking scared, man.
[111:11.73]He's gonna come and get me.
[111:12.63]I thought he was right in the hallway next door.
[111:20.20]I can't even see.
[111:23.58]I don't know.
[111:24.10]He could kill me right now.
[111:25.03]I don't know.
[111:40.10]You were right there.
[111:40.76]The game uses your microphone.
[111:43.35]It doesn't.
[112:19.07]I gotta... Don't move!
[112:43.65]Can't carry any more objects.
[112:47.51]Crowbar.
[112:51.35]Should I drop something?
[112:56.99]Something stays.
[113:00.21]I saved it.
[113:01.59]Do I need this anymore?
[113:02.47]Okay, there's a panel I can open with the crowbar.
[113:18.89]I'm so happy.
[113:19.67]I'm just gonna run out.
[113:20.52]I'm just gonna do it my way now.
[113:25.64]Can you read the dialog?
[113:26.76]What do you mean?
[113:27.28]Wait, what do you mean?
[113:28.26]Limited saves?
[113:32.74]What the fuck?
[113:35.78]We're doing it my way.
[114:13.15]Hide you fucking idiot!
[114:13.99]What's even in there?
[114:42.96]Lovetwee?
[114:44.25]Hey, Lovetwee, thanks for the raid.
[114:46.09]Welcome.
[114:51.75]Thanks for the raid.
[114:53.01]Playing a game.
[114:53.71]I'm about to rage quit it.
[114:55.81]I'm about to rage quit this game.
[114:58.39]Welcome.
[114:58.78]Hope you had a good stream.
[115:01.26]I'm ready to play.
[115:03.20]And I'm doing it my way, by the way.
[115:07.88]But no, welcome.
[115:09.00]Thanks for the raid.
[115:17.53]What is in here?
[115:19.59]Diary and a
[115:22.74]It's missing batteries.
[115:23.62]Okay, I don't... What should I drop?
[115:30.30]I'm going to drop... I don't even know what to drop here.
[115:32.36]Why is my inventory so bad?
[115:39.94]Do I still need the crowbar?
[115:52.90]Someone's coming.
[115:55.18]Use the rope in the hole?
[115:56.36]Yeah.
[115:57.48]But I need to pick up whatever this is.
[116:16.12]Can I open the fridge with the crowbar?
[116:26.05]Okay, let's get it.
[116:27.05]Where is it?
[116:27.41]Right here?
[116:28.43]Okay, I got the diary.
[116:33.83]A very battered diary.
[116:43.00]I don't like being here.
[116:46.52]The house is very dirty and smells like garbage.
[116:48.82]It only feeds me rot.
[116:57.43]Okay.
[116:57.89]Why can I not read this hiding under here?
[117:03.84]Why can I not read this hiding?
[117:06.04]It's a book.
[117:08.28]You seem pissy tonight.
[117:12.03]What?
[117:12.99]I'm playing a scary game.
[117:14.63]It's a scary environment, man.
[117:22.09]Go read it in the save room.
[117:23.47]Oh, good idea.
[117:36.87]Where's the safe room again?
[117:37.69]I don't remember.
[117:38.09]Over here.
[117:47.34]Okay.
[117:50.14]Safe.
[117:51.42]Let's read this diary.
[117:54.85]Um, he feeds me raw meat.
[117:56.35]It tastes really bad, although at least he feeds me and doesn't lock me up like mom and dad did.
[118:03.29]Today, my new father got angry with me because I threw up in my food, but I couldn't help it.
[118:11.36]He took my stuff and threw it down the well in the basement, although luckily I had my video game console hidden away.
[118:19.58]Tonight I was brave and went down to the basement, but I got scared when I got close to the well because I heard someone screaming inside, so I ran out into my room.
[118:29.01]I'm getting moved to the food my new dad gives me.
[118:32.31]I think I like it.
[118:35.13]I'm getting used to the... Alright.
[118:38.13]Today we went hunting and come back with lots of new meat.
[118:41.04]Father told me that we have to leave them alive.
[118:45.08]Until we need them to eat that way, they stay fresh and the meat tastes better.
[118:49.52]I don't know why the smell of me new home bothered me.
[118:54.43]Now I find it cozy.
[118:55.33]I don't want to be anywhere else but here.
[118:58.29]What does that even tell me?
[119:14.84]I'm going up.
[119:16.80]I'm going up.
[119:21.05]I'm going to run out.
[119:22.47]We're doing it my way.
[119:23.13]I'm going to get into the... We're going upstairs.
[119:30.41]Drop the diary.
[119:33.22]Yeah, good call.
[119:34.34]Should I pick up the crowbar again?
[119:46.22]Fucking nuts.
[120:01.63]Fuck.
[120:03.89]Fuck.
[120:04.61]Um.
[120:06.49]I'm going upstairs.
[120:10.37]Is he up here?
[120:24.59]He's up here.
[120:25.75]He's up here.
[120:26.31]He's up here now.
[120:46.81]I need the wrench.
[120:51.95]Fuck you, man.
[120:55.22]You idiot!
[120:56.12]You idiot!
[120:59.62]Get out of the fucking way!
[121:17.86]Use the rope for the wrench?
[121:18.78]I ain't gonna make it.
[121:19.56]I ain't gonna make it.
[121:25.48]Thanks for watching the stream, everybody.
[121:26.50]Appreciate it.
[121:36.68]You guys have been great.
[121:38.70]I'll definitely see you tomorrow.
[121:39.42]We're going to be playing Breath of the Wild for an hour or two.
[121:43.01]And then we're going to do one more Omega-sponsored Gotham Nightstream.
[121:47.91]We'll play Breath of the Wild first.
[121:50.83]And that...
[122:02.35]Doesn't work.
[122:03.05]Doesn't work.
[122:03.63]Doesn't work.
[122:03.99]Doesn't work.
[122:23.24]What time?
[122:23.98]2 p.m.
[122:24.63]tomorrow.
[122:25.23]2 p.m.
[122:25.43]Pacific.
[122:28.51]Breath of the Wild first.
[122:29.73]Gotham Knights.
[122:32.28]And that's probably it.
[122:32.84]We're always going to be a little shorter.
[122:34.93]Alright.
[122:47.95]What's the where am I going?
[122:53.31]Used to get the rope.
[122:54.48]Can I put that down downstairs in the basement?
[122:59.30]Can I drop that down in the well in the basement where the padlock was?
[123:03.98]Use the crowbar on the floor near the diary.
[123:05.70]I don't remember.
[123:11.54]Where's the crowbar?
[123:12.18]Where did I drop the crowbar?
[123:18.45]Fuck.
[123:19.47]I hate being in this room.
[123:23.73]It's the kitchen.
[123:39.87]Oh, that's not the kitchen, that's the bathroom!
[123:48.53]What are you doing, you fucking dumb?
[123:52.38]Are you dumb?
[123:53.50]Why would I come out?
[123:58.22]I want, like, fucking Burger King or something, you know what I mean?
[124:00.44]I want Burger King right now.
[124:01.86]I'm going to get, I want Burger King.
[124:04.34]I'm getting to Burger King.
[124:07.59]Yeah, I'm going to get Burger King.
[124:15.06]How many bandages?
[124:17.54]Okay, now use this where the diary was.
[124:20.01]On the floor where the diary... I'm going in here to be safe.
[124:32.87]Should I save it?
[124:35.05]Should I save the game?
[124:44.34]No.
[124:51.11]So you're saying the diary... Try the trunk you couldn't open, that's right.
[124:59.70]Dude, I... Did I try the trunk?
[125:05.69]The trunk was up here.
[125:25.85]Is that a video game?
[125:30.91]And a note.
[125:31.67]Dude.
[125:35.79]What's the note say?
[125:40.19]Can I open this?
[125:48.63]Stop, stop, stop.
[125:56.79]It's open.
[125:57.11]I gotta close it.
[126:00.63]Go back to where you found the diary, pick up the game console.
[126:25.47]I can't play this game.
[126:37.69]Combination of the lock in the well is the same as my score in the Mutant Horde game, although I don't remember it, and for it to repair, I have to get more than 6,000 points.
[126:44.45]Okay.
[126:48.93]Sick.
[126:49.17]Alright.
[126:51.51]Alright.
[126:53.44]Okay.
[126:59.24]Grab the game cartridge.
[127:03.08]Grab the game console.
[127:04.66]Get the padlock key.
[127:14.35]Okay.
[127:18.49]Okay.
[127:20.15]Do I have room, though?
[127:21.85]What do I do with the rope?
[127:23.25]Because I can't carry anything else.
[127:24.63]I don't know what to do with the rope.
[127:28.51]I need batteries, too.
[127:35.15]Oh, my God.
[128:02.26]Should I save it?
[128:03.72]I think I'm gonna save it.
[128:04.57]I think I gotta stop.
[128:07.77]I'm gonna save it.
[128:08.31]It's probably a stupid idea.
[128:11.53]No.
[128:12.27]What?
[128:12.93]I'm... I'm doing it.
[128:18.31]Yeah.
[128:18.73]I gotta stop.
[128:20.29]My brain is... My brain's fucked up.
[128:29.59]Okay.
[128:32.56]Yeah, I'm stopping.
[128:34.96]Holy shit.
[128:38.02]This is ridiculous.
[128:41.12]I can't believe I even showed that.
[128:43.51]I'm covered in water.
[128:46.97]I don't even want to show you my back.
[128:48.49]It's fucked.
[128:52.81]It's a horror game.
[128:54.80]Alright.
[128:57.28]Alright.
[128:58.70]It's saved.
[128:59.24]In case I ever come back to this game.
[129:02.81]This was fucked up.
[129:03.95]This whole game was a fucking nightmare.
[129:06.60]It's disgusting.
[129:08.68]Whatever.
[129:09.38]You're fine.
[129:11.82]Yeah, that's gonna be it.
[129:12.48]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[129:17.56]Tomorrow is Breath of the Wild and Gotham Knights.
[129:26.17]I will probably open with this when I play Stay Out of the House.
[129:36.98]Yeah, you've been good.
[129:39.00]You guys have been good.
[129:40.66]You get to have it.
[129:42.50]Score.
[129:50.37]That was fun.
[129:52.55]Again, thanks for sticking around.
[129:54.61]You're kind of jumbling around a lot the last day or two.
[129:58.79]But it's been a lot of fun.
[129:59.97]This stream's been very fun.
[130:02.37]Been having a blast.
[130:05.75]Gotham Knights is going to conclude tomorrow.
[130:09.09]Tomorrow's stream is only going to be probably four hours long.
[130:12.46]We'll play Breath of the Wild for like two hours?
[130:16.20]Two, three hours?
[130:18.06]And then move to Gotham Knights for a couple hours.
[130:19.70]2 p.m.
[130:24.52]Pacific.
[130:25.29]Let's just make it 2.30.
[130:26.09]Let's be safe.
[130:36.46]Appreciate it.
[130:36.84]Thanks, guys.
[130:37.28]Thanks for hanging out.
[130:37.86]Thanks for the raids.
[130:39.88]I'm going to get some food and take a shower.
[130:46.14]Have a great night.
[130:51.85]Take care.
[130:53.49]Call your mother.
[130:56.21]See you soon.
[131:26.62]Thank you.
[132:01.25]you
[132:36.13]you
