[00:04.52]I made it.
[00:04.90]Hey, I made it, okay?
[00:10.41]5.30 Pacific.
[00:11.35]We're here.
[00:12.01]I made it.
[00:12.41]Okay.
[00:21.09]I'm waiting for the presentation to start.
[00:22.70]Oh my god, I can't hear it.
[00:23.68]Am I going to be able to hear this?
[00:26.08]Yeah, right?
[00:30.36]What if I just can't hear it?
[00:32.78]Let's hope so.
[00:34.71]I'm going to make a tweet.
[00:36.30]I could put this on, I guess.
[00:37.62]You guys know what's coming up.
[00:39.00]Why is that?
[00:42.90]We'll talk about this real quick.
[00:44.79]I'll be right back.
[01:12.63]Okay.
[01:13.80]So, let's take this down.
[01:16.24]There's no intro necessary.
[01:17.92]This is going to start here in like two minutes.
[01:22.76]Oh, I have to kill the... I gotta kill the notifications too.
[01:27.43]Alright, let's do that.
[01:29.85]No notifications tonight.
[01:31.83]They are going off for the Game Awards 2018...
[01:39.55]I'm gonna wait for people to get here because there's another thing.
[01:41.57]There's something else we're doing.
[01:43.09]Something else we're doing.
[01:49.41]Face cam?
[01:50.31]Oh, wait.
[01:51.19]Are you telling me you didn't think there was gonna be a face cam?
[01:56.94]Huh?
[01:57.72]You didn't think that?
[01:59.14]Hold on, I gotta fix it.
[01:59.86]It's in the wrong spot.
[02:03.48]Hey!
[02:04.54]How are ya?
[02:07.15]This is the Game Awards.
[02:08.97]We're waiting for it to start.
[02:10.77]And before it does, why don't we peruse something else too?
[02:13.79]I mean, bang!
[02:17.13]This is the bingo board.
[02:19.33]Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
[02:22.05]Take your seats, everybody.
[02:23.07]The show is about to begin.
[02:24.39]Hey, this is the bingo board we're gonna be using.
[02:28.75]Everybody take your seats.
[02:31.45]We're playing Super Bingo.
[02:33.64]As you can tell.
[02:34.82]This can't be on the screen.
[02:36.72]Look at how, like, you can't read any of that.
[02:39.37]So, I need to, like, have this open.
[02:41.51]Oh, fuck, I need to have this open.
[02:42.91]Like, over here.
[02:45.47]But, first of all, what's very important is Fortnite is the middle spaces.
[02:49.61]Because it's going to be Game of the Year, guaranteed.
[02:51.16]That's the guaranteed space.
[02:53.88]And, uh, let me move this so we can... Hey, here we go, it's starting!
[02:56.74]I'm right on time!
[03:06.44]Link the board?
[03:11.55]I didn't upload it to anything.
[03:12.83]It's like on my computer.
[03:19.17]I don't have any access to it.
[03:20.75]Hold on.
[03:21.03]Wait, wait, just wait, wait, wait.
[04:03.79]There it is.
[04:04.67]There it is.
[04:08.03]There's like too much space.
[04:10.93]It's alright, we got one.
[04:12.13]We got one.
[04:18.40]Alright, I need to see.
[04:19.26]Because I have my bingo- hold on, I gotta get this back up here.
[04:23.79]Thank god they have a long intro.
[04:25.97]Good thing I didn't put this on.
[04:28.47]So there, you got your bingo board ready.
[04:30.07]Because here, every time something happens, I get an opportunity here.
[04:35.12]Make sure, let's see here, no one saw this coming.
[04:37.24]That says mispronunciation by the way at the top here.
[04:42.28]Celebrity presenter.
[04:44.70]Is there anyone about long run time in the beginning?
[04:50.60]No, no, no, that's not the loud I'm talking about.
[04:53.91]I'm talking about unbearable... Already a mispronunciation?
[05:00.95]No.
[05:01.17]No.
[05:05.23]I... It's not me mispronouncing.
[05:07.26]It's them mispronouncing.
[05:12.18]It's alright.
[05:12.60]We'll go back to that.
[05:20.14]Here we go!
[05:20.92]The Game Awards!
[05:24.09]Oh, really important by the way, there's a couple of things on there that say wine.
[05:28.11]I don't have a wine opener and I couldn't fucking open the bottle and I almost broke it.
[05:32.45]So I bought a bottle of wine specifically for this and I couldn't use it.
[05:38.32]I don't know how to open a bottle of wine without an opener.
[05:41.38]So this is rum.
[05:44.82]So replace wine with rum, but I ain't drinking more than five of these tonight.
[05:49.53]This presentation's like fucking 45 minutes, it'll be fine.
[05:58.12]Alright, so, a couple of really important things here.
[06:04.46]We might as well do it right now, so, while we wait, if you could please, get over to your game board and put out a Fortnite game of the year.
[06:15.20]Because that's absolutely going to win.
[06:21.84]Covered now.
[06:25.67]That's the free space, guys.
[06:31.64]You know what I mean?
[06:35.00]So, I already got four spaces.
[06:43.58]Fortnite isn't even nominated.
[06:45.62]Well, that doesn't fucking matter.
[06:49.80]That's the game.
[06:55.37]Well, we're going to get a Fortnite dance.
[06:57.03]I can fucking guarantee that.
[07:03.94]Whatever.
[07:04.80]Who gives a shit?
[07:05.66]Here it comes.
[07:11.84]This is it!
[07:13.30]It's on the way!
[07:16.02]Fortnite came out last year?
[07:17.48]Yeah, but Fortnite VR didn't come out until 2018, right?
[07:35.44]Uh, it's 534, let's go buddy!
[07:37.50]Dude, Fortnite came out last year, like the actual Battle Royale mode came out last year, is that for real?
[07:48.54]Doesn't matter, it's the fucking game of the year.
[07:50.24]It's guaranteed.
[07:56.96]DOI!
[07:57.40]You know what I mean?
[07:58.12]DOI!
[08:03.10]What's this?
[08:04.86]Game announcement!
[08:12.00]Spider-Man.
[08:12.92]Sekiro.
[08:14.28]We already know these ones.
[08:15.41]Are these all Fortnite?
[08:20.85]I gotta pay attention to these, because there's a lot of them.
[08:22.71]This is super bingo, by the way.
[08:28.69]I think the first thing we're gonna get is car on stage.
[08:32.06]I really think so.
[08:32.76]I think this can be a big fucking car.
[08:35.69]This is the pre-show.
[08:36.93]Fortnite.
[08:37.59]That wasn't that loud.
[08:38.99]What if like none of these fucking things happen?
[08:42.47]Actually, it's a little...
[09:04.74]Intimidating because we've got such a great response make it louder show, you know this year.
[09:08.43]We're bringing back the game boards orchestra We're making that bigger and better part of the show.
[09:12.39]I didn't think it was wrong We're expanding the reach of the show to many more platforms So you'll be able to watch it around the world in many different languages Which I think is really important that we can have people around the world kind of share nobody booed We're allowing people to vote in new ways you know gamers get to choose the winners alongside our judge board and
[09:29.20]And this year you can vote on Discord server, you can vote on Twitter, Facebook, even with your voice on Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.
[09:36.84]We have, I think, more new games being announced this year at the show than ever before.
[09:42.23]I can't wait to get all the mobile game announcements.
[09:44.41]A lot of studios around the world have been working in secret to kind of prepare for the Game Awards.
[09:48.41]One of the things we found last year that fans really liked were these...
[09:52.37]giveaways and special incentives to kind of watch the show.
[09:56.02]Two bald guys?
[09:56.82]No.
[09:57.94]Steam, we did something called a game giveaway, which was amazing.
[10:01.24]People just got excited because if you were watching the show, Steam Santa would just sort of drop games into your account if you were lucky enough.
[10:07.66]So we're doing that again, and we're expanding that in a lot of really interesting ways.
[10:11.38]Free stuff, right?
[10:12.72]And this is a chance for gamers around the world to get special offers on nominated games on their favorite gaming systems.
[10:20.02]And this year, we're working again with PlayStation Store, with Xbox, with Nintendo eShop, with Steam to create special offers on the nominees.
[10:28.77]And every platform will do this differently.
[10:30.51]There'll be some games that are across all, some only on certain ones.
[10:33.11]It's happening right now.
[10:34.11]Is it happening right?
[10:34.91]Alright, well, there you go.
[10:36.01]Something for free.
[10:36.53]Oh, that's amazing.
[10:37.98]This just won.
[10:38.42]I want to go buy this game.
[10:39.04]Alright, where is it?
[10:39.62]Something for free.
[10:40.34]But I get a special offer on it tonight.
[10:42.00]Let me go grab it.
[10:43.52]Something is free.
[10:44.18]Here we go.
[10:46.46]or sometimes one of these game developers will call me up on the Monday after, a small indie team, and say, you know what, Jeff, like, it was cool we were in the show, but we actually sold, like, a lot of games this weekend.
[10:56.67]That makes all the hard work worthwhile for everyone on the team.
[10:59.37]This is a confusing bingo board.
[11:00.22]No, it's not.
[11:00.68]Yeah.
[11:03.02]we can drive an audience to check out a game that they're really going to love.
[11:06.42]It's a pre-show.
[11:06.80]This shit doesn't even count.
[11:07.46]2018 was an incredible year in gaming.
[11:09.34]And we say it every year, but this industry continues to get bigger and better.
[11:13.06]Did he say cutting edge?
[11:13.68]So we're using this tagline, Worlds Will Change, in our promo campaign.
[11:16.97]And I think it started with some people thinking, like, this is the announcement of this game.
[11:21.05]But really, the tagline, to be honest with you, what it means is that a lot of existing games have evolved this year in a different way.
[11:29.55]I look at some of the in-game storytelling that Fortnite's done with the rocket launch and the cube and all these other moments and how other games have evolved.
[11:38.31]You know, No Man's Sky, it's like nominated this year and it's like it's a... Wait, why is No Man's Sky nominated for a Game of the World?
[11:44.18]So, the Worlds Will Change really reflects the idea that the games that we initially play evolve over time.
[11:50.82]Used to be you would get your cartridge, get your DVD, play the game, move on.
[11:54.86]Now you keep those games in your systems.
[11:57.38]And what you're going to see this year at the Game Awards is a lot of these sort of ongoing games are going to evolve at our show too in interesting ways.
[12:05.05]So that's kind of a tease of that theme.
[12:06.75]Fortnite Season 7.
[12:08.41]I should have put that on there.
[12:09.29]You may not know anymore after the Game Awards.
[12:14.78]We often get asked how we pick the winners for the Game Awards.
[12:18.56]The nominees are selected by a jury of press from around the world.
[12:23.87]There are over 65 different publications.
[12:25.25]That's supposed to be the press?
[12:26.03]Is that like what they're saying?
[12:26.97]They often have staffs that have played all these games.
[12:29.11]Yeah, it's a bunch of fat journalists sitting around on their iPads.
[12:30.89]So we think that's the best way to survey everything out there in a very neutral, agnostic way.
[12:34.39]What was that supposed to mean?
[12:35.53]Here are the games that we think are the best of the best.
[12:38.60]Those lead to the nominees, which have been announced.
[12:41.36]And then the winners are selected by a blended vote between the jury and also the public that gets to vote and help influence it.
[12:50.20]I have to keep track over here.
[12:51.55]Why don't you do 100% fan voting?
[12:52.93]And a lot can be socially engineered, and I don't want awards to go to games that just happen to be able to have more Twitter followers or buy a bunch of ads to somehow convince people to vote for them.
[13:05.64]So I really think it's important
[13:07.38]that the right game to win.
[13:09.18]And we have an authentic, credible process.
[13:11.48]And that's how we're going to continue with voting for the Game Awards.
[13:14.88]Okay, Fortnite is all built.
[13:15.58]Game of the Year is such a competitive category in 2018.
[13:17.78]Will it be Marvel's Spider-Man or Red Dead Redemption?
[13:21.56]This whole thing is pretty much done.
[13:22.70]Or will it be Fortnite?
[13:23.92]Good one.
[13:24.64]Or will it be God of War?
[13:26.64]Close your heart to the desperation.
[13:28.82]Celeste.
[13:30.74]Celeste Pizza!
[13:31.52]Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
[13:33.20]I love those things.
[13:34.00]We will become.
[13:36.97]in the Monster Hunter: World.
[13:38.99]You're on the A-list, right?
[13:43.11]We're about to find out at the end of the night.
[13:45.57]I cannot wait to see how this ends.
[13:48.33]It's gonna be... But right now, here's a look at our first world premiere.
[13:53.60]Okay, here it comes!
[13:54.92]Here it is!
[14:00.92]Nintendo, what do we get for Nintendo?
[14:05.03]Pulp album video game.
[14:06.43]Pulp figure!
[14:07.73]Pulp figure!
[14:08.71]What the fuck is going on?
[14:24.67]Is this a mobile game?
[14:30.34]It is really fucking loud.
[14:32.86]It is really loud.
[14:43.30]It's very, very loud.
[14:50.56]It's on the Switch.
[14:51.38]Alright, so that's not Banjo-Kazooie.
[14:54.03]That's a loud Switch game.
[15:01.36]what the audience have to say, okay?
[15:03.43]Look for a guy sleeping.
[15:04.37]That's really important.

[16:52.80]That's the thing.
[16:53.56]The last year when I was here, people thought I was crazy.
[16:56.10]I mean, I am a bit crazy, but it's the audience and the way they were sharing.
[16:59.94]Everyone watching around the world.

[19:31.51]He's a world premier.
[19:33.79]Okay, Kindred Space.
[19:39.32]The awards haven't even started yet.
[19:43.18]How's that possible?
[19:43.98]That's a bald guy!
[19:44.74]That's a bald guy!
[19:45.52]Does that guy count?
[20:00.79]No, he doesn't count.
[20:01.39]That's not a real person.
[20:02.69]No, no, no.
[20:03.13]It's got to be a guy presenting on stage.
[20:04.97]It's got to be a real person.
[20:06.93]Not just a bald guy in a video game.
[20:08.75]I can't believe they didn't think they were mom.
[20:14.68]What the fuck?
[20:18.28]Automatic distress signal.
[20:22.10]Relay to command center.
[20:24.51]Mayday.
[20:28.64]This is No Man's Sky 2.
[20:29.57]Journey to the Savage Planet.
[20:30.91]I've no idea.
[20:31.47]Join the pioneer program Savage.
[20:33.51]I don't know what that is.
[20:34.95]I don't know what we just watched.
[20:36.73]It was just like space stuff and a guy lying on the ground.
[20:58.90]That was the announcement of Journey to the Savage Planet.
[21:00.63]I'm now here with Alex Hutchinson, one of the founders of the new indie TV, Life Moon Studios.
[21:04.65]So first of all, Alex, welcome to the show.
[21:06.95]Why did you guys start this new studio up in Montreal?
[21:09.73]I think it's that moment in life.
[21:11.13]You know, we've been doing this about 15 years for myself, making games for other people.
[21:14.41]So it's incredibly amazing to see a game we built on our own from nothing with friends of ours in the business.
[21:20.46]And to see it at your show on the big screen is super fulfilling.
[21:23.60]So in a weird way, that's the start of the reason why.
[21:26.18]I just screamed that so loud.
[21:27.46]We love supporting new teams.
[21:28.59]Tell us a bit about Journey to the Savage Planet, kind of a teaser trailer.
[21:31.05]So what kind of game is it?
[21:32.34]Yeah, so everyone, they watch the teaser and they always say, is it a Battle Royale?
[21:34.90]No, it's actually not a Battle Royale.
[21:36.80]I was so happy.
[21:37.80]I was so happy.
[21:38.94]No, it is not.
[21:40.14]It's an adventure game.
[21:41.06]You get dropped on a strange alien world by a company called Kindred Aerospace, who are very proud to be the fourth best interstellar space exploration company.
[21:50.11]So they drop you there with absolutely no gear, high hopes, and no ability, and they hope that you can solve the mystery of what's on the Savage planet.
[21:57.25]We might get a missed handshake.
[21:58.31]How can we find out more about this game when we get updates?
[22:00.97]Uh, so we're not going to show much gameplay until next year, but we're very excited to do it, so we'll show you gameplay and all kinds of new bits and pieces.
[22:07.56]I didn't put no gameplay trailer.
[22:09.14]Alright, so get ready for 2019.
[22:11.14]Alex, thank you so much for coming down and showing your game for the first time here at the Game Awards.
[22:14.92]We really appreciate it.
[22:16.14]Dammit.
[22:16.76]Okay.
[22:16.92]The Witcher 3.
[22:17.32]The Witcher 3!
[22:17.66]The Witcher 3!
[22:18.33]It's gonna be Monster Hunter: World.
[22:20.57]Better be.
[22:21.25]It's got Monster Hunter: World.
[22:22.69]It has to be, right?
[22:42.11]For best role-playing game, let me open this one up.
[22:44.37]And the winner for best role-playing game goes to Monster Hunter: World.
[22:48.46]Congratulations.
[22:52.40]I can't scream.
[22:54.44]They're all on stage.
[22:55.22]Hold on a second.
[22:55.70]What is this?
[22:56.24]It's for you guys.
[22:56.90]At least two people accepting an award.
[22:58.44]How does it feel?
[22:59.04]Photo op.
[23:02.16]Selfie.
[23:02.54]Take a selfie.
[23:03.50]How's it feel?
[23:06.24]It's very great that we actually were able to come from Japan.
[23:11.89]Welcome.
[23:19.23]That's a good game.
[23:19.89]It was a good game.
[23:22.01]When we began creating the game, this game, we were talking amongst the team members that it's kind of our goal to actually be able to be here and receive the award.
[23:39.18]More than five?
[23:40.08]No, no.
[23:40.88]Where is it?
[23:42.24]So we made it.
[23:45.48]Full circle.
[23:46.44]That means a lot to all of us.
[23:47.48]Thank you so much.
[23:48.80]And one more thing.
[23:50.98]Two more bald guys?
[23:51.70]No.
[23:51.84]We will have great news for our fans soon.
[23:54.16]At least 10 people accepting the award.
[23:55.30]That's way too many.
[23:56.07]How soon?
[23:56.41]Tonight soon?
[23:56.75]No.
[24:08.39]This is not going to be 10 people accepting.
[24:10.39]Okay.
[24:10.79]Alright.
[24:11.84]Scratch that off your bingo card.
[24:13.66]Alright.
[24:14.22]Well, congratulations, guys, on winning the best RPG.
[24:16.54]He's watching.
[24:17.62]He's watching this stream.
[24:18.93]So maybe we'll see you guys again on stage.
[24:22.21]Thank you very much, guys.
[24:23.07]Congratulations.
[24:24.33]Awesome.
[24:26.24]Alright, thank you very much.
[24:27.75]There's been a lot of gaming conversation happening on Twitter this year.
[24:31.29]I can't believe you said that.
[24:33.49]Twitter decided to create their first Twitter gaming award.
[24:35.79]You, the fans, voted for the best conversation, and the winner, out of all the big things that happened this year, was Spider-Man's PS4 photo mode.
[24:44.59]So you can go to Twitter Gaming now to see the announcement video of that winner.
[24:47.73]And of course, tweet up a storm all night about the Game Awards.
[24:50.50]There's some big news breaking that you definitely will want to be talking about.
[24:53.86]Now, we're also back on Twitch this year.
[24:55.92]We've got an interactive extension that lets you predict the winners throughout the show.
[25:00.07]What is that?
[25:00.51]They're post-streaming, but there's also this interactive extension, so you can go online to the Game Awards channel, pick your winners throughout the night, and at the end of the show, we'll share the final leaderboard and see who predicted the most awards correctly.
[25:10.52]What if you don't have that?
[25:11.26]I didn't do that.
[25:11.98]Where is that?
[25:12.40]Alright, well, we've got some other awards to get to now.
[25:14.22]It's been an absolutely huge year for esports.
[25:16.92]And coming up at the top of the hour in the main show, the Best Esports Player Award will be presented by Omen by HP.

[27:57.94]Alright.
[27:58.28]Well, we've got more esports coming up in the main show.
[28:00.38]But right now, we've got another world premiere.
[28:02.62]This is a favorite game of mine from a couple of years ago.
[28:05.81]And they reached out to me a couple of weeks ago and said, hey, we've got something more we're doing.
[28:08.45]We want to share with you at the Game Awards.
[28:09.91]So check this out.
[28:11.35]I think you'll like it.
[28:14.20]World premiere.
[28:14.92]Alright.
[28:16.22]Let's see it.
[28:16.60]This is a story of a video game called The Stanley Parable.
[28:21.17]You knew The Stanley Parable, of course.
[28:23.25]After all, it was the video game sensation of 2013.
[28:27.49]Don't you remember all those awards we were nominated for?
[28:30.32]And this year's winner for best narrative is The Last of Us.
[28:33.14]Are they going to do another game?
[28:34.14]The Last of Us.
[28:34.80]The Last of Us.
[28:35.70]Papers, please.
[28:36.60]The Last of Us.
[28:37.30]Papers, please.
[28:38.00]The Last of Us.
[28:39.83]Yes, it was thrilling to be so unanimously recognized by our peers.
[28:44.53]Which is why we've locked the game's source code away where it can never be touched by the greedy hand of capitalism.
[28:50.95]A pristine time capsule of perfect artistic integrity to be preserved for... Wait.
[28:58.07]What do you mean we never put the game on consoles?
[29:00.74]Of course we put it on consoles.
[29:02.52]This is a remake or remaster.
[29:04.12]We didn't.
[29:04.70]There it is.
[29:05.62]Fill it in.
[29:05.92]Excuse me a moment.
[29:11.59]Remake or remaster?
[29:12.76]Stanley Powerball going to console.
[29:15.90]Fill it in, boys and girls!
[29:17.94]Gotcha.
[29:18.86]Stanley, I've had a great idea.
[29:20.55]I want to add new endings and new content, new adventures for you.
[29:25.13]Won't it be fun?
[29:27.37]Oh, shush, of course it will.
[29:33.38]We'll package it up with the original game, and we'll put it on consoles, and everyone will buy it again because they're suckers.
[29:39.48]Come, Tom.
[29:40.56]This might be a joke.
[29:41.46]Daddy needs a third swimming pool.
[29:55.66]What do you mean The Last of Us 2 is also coming out next year?
[30:04.67]Alright, Stanley Parable back again.
[30:07.21]Now is my honor to present the award for the best student game, judged by an incredible panel, including Megan Ellison from Annapurna, Todd Howard, Jenova Chen, and my good friend Hideo Kojima.

[30:22.37]UC Santa Cruz, JR from DigiPen in Spain, Life from Izar Digital in France, and Recharge from MIT.

[30:53.07]Congratulations to you guys, and hopefully your game will come out soon.
[30:55.63]We'll get to play it?
[30:56.45]Yeah, in August, hopefully.
[30:58.15]I don't think we're going to get the mic thing.
[30:59.99]They have mics for everybody.
[31:01.79]Okay.
[31:02.33]So be sure to check that out.
[31:05.28]We'd also like to thank the jury and all the people who voted for us, and of course our team.
[31:10.88]And your mother!
[31:11.26]And your mother!
[31:11.92]And your mother!
[31:12.84]Alright, we've got another world premiere for you.
[31:15.56]This is from a small indie team of three guys who have been working on this game for the past five years.
[31:21.72]It's called Among Trees, and when I saw some footage of this, I said, we've got to share it with you, so check this out.
[31:45.98]This trailer uses pre-alpha footage and represents a work in progress.
[31:48.59]It's not real.
[31:55.49]Is that an animal?
[31:56.98]No, it's not a trained animal on stage.
[32:03.72]Some of these are not going to fucking happen, but if they do, that's pretty cool.
[32:18.38]What was that game where I took naked pictures of my dick?
[32:23.25]What was that game called?
[32:24.81]Like, I had the naked pictures of myself.
[32:26.93]What was it called?
[32:27.55]What was it?
[32:28.21]Firewatch.
[32:29.01]Firewatch 2.
[32:29.67]Among Trees.
[32:37.15]I don't... Okay.
[32:37.93]Alright, whatever.
[32:38.50]Whatever.
[32:40.62]The guys that were just on stage like student programmers.
[32:44.11]Alright.
[32:44.63]Well, now it's the top of the hour, and that means I think it's time for the Game Awards.
[32:48.19]Are you guys ready?
[32:48.84]Well, this is now it starts.
[32:51.56]You know, this show is all about bringing everyone together to celebrate video games.
[32:56.54]When I started this show five years ago, my dream was to put competition aside and come together to celebrate what we love, which is playing games, making games, and this is a mall that has been in the making for me.
[33:08.18]I can't believe it's about to happen.
[33:09.96]But to kick off the show, I couldn't think of anything better than this.
[33:12.84]Please join me in welcoming, from Nintendo, Reggie Fils-Aimé.

[35:37.48]I can't believe it.
[35:38.66]Enjoy the show.
[35:43.06]I was going to do this too, I was going to put on full orchestra on stage, but instead I put fucking car, car on stage.
[35:51.44]This was going to be full orchestra on stage and I fucked it up.
[35:55.17]There's not going to be a car on stage.
[35:57.33]It's not going to happen.
[36:11.84]Cover it anyways.
[36:13.08]No, I can't, I can't just cover it because it exists.
[36:17.08]You understand?
[36:24.09]The Schick microphone.
[36:27.03]Nobody sneezed yet?
[36:34.15]We got like three hours though, guys.
[36:35.99]Somebody's gonna cough into that microphone.
[36:38.95]Someone's gonna sleep.
[36:39.93]It's gonna be a fight on stage.
[36:46.26]Why did I put car?
[36:48.94]They're not putting the car onto the fucking stage.
[37:04.24]It was supposed to be orchestra, okay?
[37:06.48]Fill it in.
[37:20.68]Here's the creator of the Game Awards, Jeff Keighley.
[37:29.83]Amazing.
[37:30.87]How about that?

[39:39.48]I don't know if I agree with that.
[39:41.44]Spider-Man is just, hey, look.
[39:43.26]Yeah, the narrative was great when it was written, you know, fucking 10 years, 15 years ago.
[39:49.89]Be careful out there.
[39:50.63]This is nasty country.
[39:52.77]Yeah.
[39:57.18]Shots fired.
[39:57.82]What?
[39:58.04]No, I'm just saying like Spider-Man, like as a series, like Doc Octopus already exists.

[41:07.28]Throughout the night, we're going to take a look at the future of games with world premieres.
[41:10.68]Now, some of them you've probably heard of, and some of them you definitely haven't.
[41:14.95]We've got some good surprises tonight.
[41:17.03]And this is one of those that no one is going to see coming.
[41:19.81]Enjoy.

[42:59.77]Please welcome an actor and the writer-director of the film Mid-90s.
[43:07.52]Here's Jonah Hill.
[43:17.78]There he is.
[43:18.28]Shout out to Woody Jackson, the best composer in the world.
[43:22.83]We might get bingo much earlier than I thought.
[43:25.95]I am honored to be here tonight to introduce someone who has truly changed gaming forever.
[43:31.63]Someone who, in his own words, just wanted to make killer games with his friends and ended up making some of the world's most memorable titles.
[43:40.13]30 years ago, he and his friends started with nothing.
[43:42.87]They worked in a small basement under a nurse's call center.
[43:46.24]Over the years, Greg Thomas and his team at Visual Concepts created iconic games by following a simple recipe.
[43:53.92]Hard work, strong ideas, and a passionate team.
[43:57.30]And that recipe gave us NBA 2K.
[44:02.21]Greg?
[44:03.13]Yeah, give it up.
[44:04.39]He does it.
[44:05.39]He does it.
[44:09.79]Greg is a humble giant, but his forward-thinking passion and dedication to excellence has made his name known throughout the industry.
[44:18.59]Let's take a look back at his highlight reel.
[44:23.84]Industry Icon Award.
[44:30.96]Oh, boy, I just talked off.
[44:40.48]I talk a lot of shit about this company.
[44:42.73]A lot.
[44:46.77]About visual concepts.
[44:50.89]It's showtime.
[44:54.05]He scores.
[44:54.43]It is in the net.
[45:01.33]Oh, no.
[45:01.93]That's how you blow out the speakers, baby.
[45:04.58]2K Sports Major League Baseball.
[45:06.62]Rock him out.
[45:08.02]Home run.
[45:09.14]No.
[45:12.59]The NBA right here on 2K Sports.
[45:15.31]The greatest basketball game in the world.
[45:17.60]This game bigger than the court.
[45:21.72]This king is far from finished.
[45:35.70]Seriously.
[45:36.24]Very cool.
[45:37.36]Why that company?
[45:38.24]I am honored to introduce the 2018 industry icon, the legend, the myth, the goat, Mr. Greg Thomas.
[45:57.00]I mean, he did a lot.
[45:57.70]He did a lot for the industry.
[45:58.82]He did.
[46:04.93]Thank you, Jonah.
[46:06.11]It's such an honor to be introduced by you.
[46:08.49]What the hell was that?
[46:10.43]Seeing a compilation of the games that we've created over the last 30 years is also very humbling.
[46:16.43]Do we have something like that on here?
[46:17.45]For anyone who knows me, you know I've shied away from the spotlight.
[46:21.91]I'm not very comfortable being in the center of attention.
[46:25.57]This has never been about making a name for myself.
[46:30.75]It's always been about making great games.
[46:41.57]But this is an incredible honor.
[46:44.85]First, I need to thank my beautiful wife and family for allowing me to do everything I've always loved to do.
[46:54.18]There have been many sacrifices, and they have been patient, loyal, and understanding through it all.
[47:01.53]I love you all very much.
[47:03.15]Thank you.
[47:08.60]You did a lot.
[47:09.70]You did a lot for this.
[47:10.88]And none of this would be possible without my business partner and co-founder, Scott Patterson, and my brother and the leader of the NBA 2K team, Jeff Thomas.
[47:25.36]I'd love for you guys to join me on stage.
[47:27.74]We're going to get two balls, guys.
[47:29.38]Thank you.
[47:37.86]we've been together since the very beginning and we've always shared the same values and passions when it comes to making games no we never imagined that over the years visual concepts would grow to where we are today with six worldwide studios and more than 350 employees the philosophy has never changed it's all family to me
[48:04.40]I also want to thank David Ismailer, Carl Sladoff, and Strauss Zelnick from 2K and Take Two for believing in me and giving us the freedom to make games our way.
[48:18.07]And I... And I owe everything to my management team.
[48:29.11]This team has been together for a long time.
[48:33.53]The culture of the company has always been about believing in our people.
[48:38.99]It's because we love working together and we all believe in the same things.
[48:44.11]And I need to thank all of their families as well for supporting us and putting up with us.
[48:49.58]That can't be easy.
[48:51.30]Thank you so much.
[49:01.96]Without these people,
[49:03.92]There is no Greg Thomas receiving an award.
[49:06.96]There is no visual concepts.
[49:09.76]They are the real icons, and I share this award with them.
[49:13.47]Thank you very much.
[49:19.47]No, he got it.
[49:19.81]He got the new trick.
[49:25.39]Congratulations, Greg.
[49:26.67]Now, tonight, the Game Awards and Facebook Gaming are recognizing global gaming citizens, people who are enriching the lives of others around the world through video games.
[49:35.68]We're going to tell some stories tonight of three people that I think you should meet and hear their stories, and I'm so proud to have these in the Game Awards.
[49:42.28]First up, Steven Spahn from AbleGamers.
[49:44.76]Please take a look at his story.
[49:55.08]I don't know how I got where I am or what I'm doing.
[49:58.78]All I wanted to do was figure out how to play video games.
[50:02.97]And along the way, I figured out that I could help other people play video games too.
[50:06.99]I love that sad TV.
[50:11.03]When I was coming out of high school, I went to my guidance counselor to figure out what's next in life for me.
[50:18.22]They sat across the table from me and they told me that I should go home and have fun with my remaining years because I'm going to die soon anyway.
[50:26.89]They told me to just go home and die.
[50:30.03]At the time, it kicked me down, but now it's a memory that I look back on and I realize that you can be disabled, you can be productive, you can be a valuable, contributing member of society, and you can change the world by doing a few things along the way that no one else is willing to do.
[50:49.22]I'm proud to be one of the leaders of AbleGamers in helping people with disabilities be able to conquer the challenges of getting back into playing video games.
[50:57.63]My mission is to enable people to use technology to reach out, to connect with a world that was otherwise inaccessible.
[51:07.60]They're able to have a greater quality of life by having people in their lives.
[51:16.69]Cheers to that, for real.
[51:20.22]Amazing.
[51:21.38]Steven, you rock.
[51:22.50]Three years ago, Psyonix burst onto the scene, and rocker-powered soccer has never been the same with more than 52 million players worldwide.
[51:29.34]It's a two-time winner at the Game Awards, and now Rocket League is revealing their latest DLC right here.
[51:34.92]Check it out.
[51:35.64]DLC!
[51:36.20]It's not actually a game announcement, though.
[51:38.98]Come on.
[51:41.24]Announcing downloadable content on the Game Awards?
[51:46.62]But it's Rocket League, so... It'll be like an ice cream truck, right?
[51:49.76]Alright, it's already filled in.
[51:53.98]Car on stage.
[51:55.34]Car reveal.
[51:56.04]Just change it to car reveal.
[51:57.34]Who cares?
[52:09.38]That thing already would have been off.
[52:10.96]You took the fucking fondant off already.
[52:21.90]I don't play this game.
[52:22.70]I don't play it.
[52:23.58]I played a lot today.
[52:24.78]Just didn't play it every day.
[52:27.87]I mean, the game's cool, I guess, but I don't... whatever.
[52:31.31]The wiring's in the game, though.
[52:35.72]I mean, I don't play Rocket League.
[52:37.28]I've heard it was fun.
[52:38.08]The people who played Rocket League, they think it's a fun game.
[52:39.96]They enjoy themselves in Rocket League, and that's fun.
[52:42.13]Coming up, Christoph Waltz and Rosa Salazar hand out the award for best performance.
[52:48.27]And later, more surprise game announcements and musical performances.
[52:53.42]This is the Game Awards 2018.
[52:54.96]Hold on, are they going to get, like, actors on stage to act out stuff in the game?
[53:00.06]That's what I would fucking pay for.
[53:01.64]Wake up.
[53:02.10]Wake up.
[53:02.52]The time has come.
[53:04.60]For paths to be beat and treasures won.
[53:08.07]And impossible tales to be sung.
[53:12.53]As we take on our foes, together as one.
[53:18.33]We send our fears back to where they came from.
[53:24.48]I don't show... Whoops, that's my camera.
[53:26.86]I don't show fucking ads on this stream.
[53:30.96]I don't show ads on the stream.
[53:32.16]But I'll show it.
[53:32.82]But it's just like Smash Brothers, so I gotta put it back on.
[53:35.78]Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
[53:54.83]Coming soon.
[53:56.03]In fact, we're... Who's that character?
[53:57.53]...away, baby.
[53:59.51]Who's that character?
[54:00.21]Who's that guy with the bear?
[54:01.08]I don't show ads on my stream.
[54:05.54]Sorry.
[54:05.76]I don't put advertising on my stream.
[54:33.26]Whoa!
[54:33.74]It's Baraka!
[54:39.08]Alright, that's back on.
[54:40.20]Fine.
[54:40.66]I'm just gonna sit like this the whole rest of the screen.
[55:06.06]Oh, cool.
[55:06.90]...from the upcoming film Alita Battle Angel.
[55:09.50]Please welcome Rosa Salazar and two-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz.
[55:16.02]These are already celebrity presenters, but we gotta, we gotta, let's see.
[55:21.68]To deliver a powerful game performance, you must humanize a digital puppet made of polygons and textures.
[55:28.77]In a sense, the actor plays the surrogate for their audience, their entry point,
[55:35.19]into the game's world and personalities.
[55:40.37]Then, unlike any medium, the connection continues and strengthens when the player controls that very character with an analog stick.
[55:47.61]That was a fucking sneeze.
[55:48.15]That was like a cough or a sneeze.
[55:49.25]I'm sorry, that counts.
[55:50.21]I prefer mouse and keyboard.
[55:51.65]I'm not gonna do this with you.
[55:57.30]Look, I mean, aim assist is just... Okay.
[56:02.76]These are the nominees for Best Performance.
[56:07.99]Best Performance.
[56:11.02]For me, it was strong female characters that I happen to know.
[56:17.45]Join us in battle.
[56:19.15]Alright, Spartans.
[56:20.77]I'll fight with you.
[56:23.39]I didn't choose to be different.
[56:25.93]You better win.
[56:26.48]Connor.
[56:27.88]Come on, it's Connor.
[56:28.86]Connor has to win this.
[56:30.46]Come on.
[56:30.84]Do you have anything to say in your defense?
[56:35.51]To be effective in combat, a warrior must not feel for his enemy.
[56:39.21]So I'm a man now, like you?
[56:41.75]We are not men.
[56:43.31]We are more than that.
[56:46.55]You're Spider-Man.
[56:47.83]Look, next time, need the fighting to the pros.
[56:49.64]That was a good Spider-Man.
[56:50.92]That was a good Spider-Man.
[56:52.70]Okay, but what if there aren't any around?
[56:54.82]Good one.
[56:55.78]I mean... This whole thing is pretty much done.
[56:59.84]He's good, too.
[57:00.62]He's got Conro.
[57:01.30]I don't know.
[57:01.96]Ghosts and beasts.
[57:04.52]I would say Conor or Clark.
[57:06.02]Can I add a category?
[57:39.79]I guess this is the part where words that make sense are supposed to come out of my mouth.
[57:46.32]Thank you.
[57:47.34]I humbly accept this honor, especially in light of the amazing performances of my fellow nominees.
[57:53.22]Wow.
[57:56.96]To share this moment in time with all of you, a moment in time which is clearly becoming the advent of a golden age of this medium.
[58:08.23]I gotta thank my wife, Molly.
[58:09.79]I love you, Molly.
[58:11.19]And mom.
[58:11.45]For five years, she watched me come home from long days of performance capture and kindly reminded me to check Arthur at the door, put the kids to bed.
[58:21.47]You didn't want Arthur.
[58:22.63]You didn't want Arthur.
[58:26.82]I would also like to thank Rockstar Games for the amazing opportunity.
[58:32.64]The faith that they put in me.
[58:34.88]Thank you.
[58:35.42]Thank you all.
[58:37.37]This is an amazing moment!
[58:38.57]It was very good.
[58:42.37]It was great.
[58:45.41]I feel bad for Connor, though, because Connor... That performance was very real.
[58:50.42]He was the narrative director for one of the biggest games in Ubisoft history, Far Cry 5, and he's here right now to unveil the next chapter.
[58:58.22]Please welcome... Far Cry 6.
[58:59.60]Here comes Far Cry number 6, guys.
[59:11.30]at some point okay like honestly like if it's Far Cry six hello everyone yeah at some point like you may remember and did uh with confetti dropping on Montana and this marked the very beginning of a brand new world because yes we're finally bringing the post-apocalypse to Far Cry
[59:35.35]And as the creative director of this new project, it is my absolute pleasure to reveal to you Far Cry New Dawn.
[59:44.15]No, you just didn't number it.
[59:45.81]Whatever.
[59:47.73]Do we have to just, like, make a, make like a fucking monster movie or something, you know what I mean?
[59:53.37]Make like a Return of the Monsters.
[59:55.91]Far Cry, like, seven, like, just make like a movie where you have a video game, you play as a character, and you're a monster in a monster universe.
[60:11.58]We were just kids when the bombs dropped and the world went to shit.
[60:18.18]They said it was supposed to be the end of everything.
[60:22.96]I want like Jason, Freddy Krueger, the mummy.
[60:25.54]It was just the beginning.
[60:28.81]All the same game and like he plays a monster.
[60:30.91]Nah, we were better than that.
[60:35.05]This new world had a lot to give and we took it all.
[60:40.83]That's how we came out on top.
[60:44.33]That's how we got here.
[60:47.35]That's how we found you.
[60:58.00]Listen here, rabbits.
[61:01.74]You need to understand something.
[61:05.34]The only currency left in this world is power.
[61:11.57]I want to play as a chef.
[61:17.75]These studios have millions of dollars.
[61:19.43]Don't make like another Far Cry.
[61:20.53]Make like a fucking chef game.
[61:23.17]You should be a chef in an open world.
[61:24.87]Why the fuck hasn't somebody done that?
[61:53.08]That's a monster.
[61:54.44]They finally listened to me.
[61:56.44]I wanted a monster in the game.
[62:21.26]It's alright.
[62:24.42]I'll play it for like three hours.
[62:25.22]That's so close.
[62:25.54]February 15th is when it comes out?
[62:41.83]What the fuck?

[63:25.02]Where do you think you are?
[63:28.56]Who do you think you're talking to?
[63:32.58]Nobody gets out of my domain, whether alive or dead.
[63:38.30]You wish to learn the hard way?
[63:40.16]It's not gonna be a card game.
[63:41.12]Fine.
[63:42.44]Then go.
[63:43.22]Get out.
[63:45.42]It's not gonna be a card game.
[63:49.36]Mobile.
[63:49.94]It's a mobile game?
[64:08.18]Zeus?
[64:10.16]Who do you play?
[64:11.14]Socrates, right?
[64:13.94]What's his name?
[64:16.62]What's the guy's name?
[64:22.92]What's his name?
[64:26.49]Plato.
[64:27.23]It's like a Dark Souls, but it's like Bastion and Transistor in the same game.
[64:46.15]Death is your only family.
[64:49.93]Death and I. Hades.
[64:59.42]I would play it for a little bit.
[65:08.09]It's alright.
[65:08.43]It's now available on early access in the Epic Games Store.
[65:17.25]Congratulations to you guys from Supergiant.
[65:18.83]That is an early access title.
[65:20.37]They're going to be updating over time, and it's available tonight, right now, on the Epic Games Store.
[65:25.19]So congratulations, Greg Amir, and the entire team there at Supergiant.
[65:28.59]I am here now with my friend Patrice Desilets, the designer behind Assassin's Creed, famously, and you're working on a new project called Ancestors, a humankind odyssey.
[65:38.31]Patrice, tell us about this game.
[65:39.39]Thank God you're not making another Assassin's Creed.
[65:42.03]Thank you for having me.
[65:42.99]It's quite an honor for me to be here.
[65:46.08]Thank you.
[65:46.42]So yes, I'm working on Ancestors The Humankind Odyssey.
[65:51.02]It is a single player open world exploration survival game.
[65:56.07]It is set in Africa starting 10 million years ago.
[66:00.14]where basically players will play from the last common ancestors of all the big apes up to Lucy, the famous Australopithecus.
[66:08.70]Okay, that's a lot of game there.
[66:11.00]Tell us a bit about where you're at in this game and what we're going to see tonight, because you're going to show us some gameplay, right?
[66:15.01]Here comes some gameplay.
[66:15.95]Oh, totally.
[66:16.21]So this game is done by Panache Digital Games, my new studio back in Montreal.
[66:20.23]30 people.
[66:21.01]Hi, everyone.
[66:23.07]And tonight I'm going to show four clips of actual gameplay.
[66:27.32]That was really close.
[66:28.20]How long is an awkward silence?
[66:29.66]This is real.
[66:30.40]Patrice on the sticks.
[66:31.72]Exactly, exactly.
[66:33.04]And if people like what they see, they can go on GameSpot and see another 20 minutes of me playing the very beginning of the game after the show.
[66:41.72]Alright, you're showing it all.
[66:42.87]Here it is, Ancestors, A Humankind Odyssey.
[66:45.09]Thank you, Patrice.
[66:45.81]Where the fuck is awkward silence?
[66:47.35]Here it is.
[66:55.74]Inspired by true events.
[66:58.32]This is 10 million years ago.
[67:00.14]It's a giant snake?
[67:15.66]What the fuck is happening?
[67:30.03]What the fuck?
[68:03.70]Ancestors.
[68:04.58]Okay, there's a few ways that, I mean, that's kind of like Spore, but it happened in real life.
[68:17.46]You know what I mean?
[68:20.02]The question I have to ask is, do I get to, like, fly in spaceships eventually?
[68:23.68]You know what I mean?
[68:36.56]I'll be right back, I gotta pee.
[68:38.22]I need another one of these too.
[68:39.57]I'll be right back.
[69:05.34]Games play best on Xbox One.
[70:09.61]Girls Make Games is a program that inspires girls to make games.
[70:13.77]It teaches them the tools that they need to get from start, where they know nothing, to get to a full developed prototype in three weeks.
[70:20.61]My favorite part about camp, doing the designing for how the platform is.
[70:26.69]My experience with GMG has given me the confidence
[70:32.99]to pursue other writing and video game projects.
[70:39.74]The whole mission is just amazing.
[70:42.48]To really inspire young girls to learn to make games and really get the female perspective and voice in games.
[70:50.03]We're good?
[70:54.17]You didn't even comment on my glass!
[70:58.63]Why did you not even comment on that?
[71:11.10]Alright, so did anything happen while I was gone?
[71:14.80]I don't think I missed anything.
[71:19.34]We have so much more game awards to come right now.
[71:21.72]Here's another world premiere.
[71:24.12]This might be more than five, right?
[71:25.74]Is this more than five premieres?
[71:26.90]Because I gotta fill that in.
[71:32.34]This would be five.
[71:34.40]Okay, fill it in.
[71:38.72]Only possible with spatial OS.
[71:42.84]Is this a VR presentation?
[71:44.22]Well, no, somebody has to get on stage and put the headset on.
[71:46.26]I don't think that's gonna happen, though.
[71:48.10]I don't think anyone's gonna get on stage with a fucking headset on.
[72:03.11]I don't know what this is.
[72:16.57]Garfield?
[72:17.19]Is it Starfield?
[72:26.81]I don't think it's... Oh, Starfield!
[72:29.73]I don't think this is... This is not Starfield.
[72:47.35]Borderlands 3.
[72:48.69]Wait, didn't Gearbox shut down?
[72:53.62]Didn't they?
[72:54.00]Permanently?
[72:54.42]No, no, no, no.
[73:00.22]Yeah, they did.
[73:01.98]They may as well have.
[73:11.37]I'm kidding.
[73:12.39]It's a joke.
[73:13.77]I'm kidding.
[73:15.87]I was just making a joke about video gaming.
[73:22.96]Scavengers.
[73:31.78]That's your first look at Scavengers, and I'm now here with Josh Holmes from Midwinter.
[73:35.16]Josh, tell us a bit about your studio.
[73:37.80]Yeah, well, so Midwinter's a new studio up in Seattle, Washington.
[73:41.78]We're a relatively small team.
[73:43.34]We're just over 20 people.
[73:45.47]Many of us come from AAA background, working on titles like Halo and Battlefield.
[73:49.91]I don't want IPS, new IPS.
[73:51.05]I want sequels.
[73:52.03]Why do you want sequels?
[73:53.01]We got a tease of sort of the world there, some of the characters.
[73:55.37]What kind of game is it?
[73:56.39]So Scavengers is a survival shooter competition.
[73:59.78]It's a game where teams need to cooperate to survive, but compete to win.
[74:04.92]So what we're doing is we're taking all of the aspects of a survival game and sort of condensing that into a replayable session-based multiplayer experience.
[74:13.25]Awesome.
[74:13.47]Alright.
[74:13.73]And if people want to learn more, it's a little tag there to sign up, right?
[74:17.95]Yeah, yeah.
[74:18.47]For us, it's so important to have players have a voice in shaping the game.
[74:22.54]And so starting in 2019, we're going to be having playtests.
[74:25.86]And people can go right now, go to scavengersgame.com, sign up, and you'll be among the first to play Scavengers in 2019.
[74:33.30]Awesome.
[74:33.60]Alright.
[74:33.92]Well, thank you so much for putting that together.
[74:35.52]It's an amazing world premiere.
[74:37.18]First look at Scavengers, Josh.
[74:39.42]Sign up for that now.
[74:40.50]Alright.
[74:40.98]It's now time to present our next award.
[74:43.38]Please welcome the front man from Panic!
[74:45.32]at the Disco to do it, Brendon Urie.
[74:58.60]I just want to say what an honor it is to be here first off.
[75:00.86]And secondly, I have to apologize because I was supposed to write something last night, but I stayed up till 5 a.m.
[75:05.68]playing season seven of Fortnite.
[75:06.88]So I apologize.
[75:08.40]Fortnite reference.
[75:09.26]Oh, wait, never mind.
[75:10.92]They wrote it for me.
[75:13.16]Personally, as a musician...
[75:16.70]I'm constantly amazed by the skills of the composers in this industry.
[75:20.16]They make tracks that elevate all the action and tension and set the perfect mood.
[75:24.34]Here are the nominees.
[75:26.02]What's this for?
[75:27.20]Best Score or Music.
[75:36.42]Has any disgruntled nominee tweeted after they lost?
[75:39.38]Somebody needs to find that out.
[75:48.01]I didn't play either one of these two games.
[75:52.81]That was pretty good.
[75:54.17]Spider-Man is pretty good.
[75:57.23]It's gonna be Red Dead.
[75:58.15]I don't know what this game is.
[76:03.60]Apparently it's got a good, useful track score.
[76:08.80]Octopath Traveler.
[76:16.33]I can already tell, like, there comes Red Dead.
[76:18.33]This will be three for Red Dead, right?
[76:24.03]We only need two more to get the extra bonus space.
[76:25.77]Okay.
[76:28.68]Only two more for the extra bonus space.
[76:31.26]Red Dead Redemption 2!
[76:39.84]One, two, three, four.
[76:41.52]Get them up there.
[76:41.98]Come on, get ten up there.
[76:51.26]This is going to be just like when Return of the King came out.
[76:54.80]It won every single fucking award at the Academy Awards.
[76:58.26]It's going to win like 12 different categories.
[77:02.04]Thanks.
[77:04.40]I wasn't expecting it, but thanks a lot.
[77:06.94]Thanks to my wife, Sharon Jackson, my two daughters, Georgia Washington Jackson,
[77:14.10]and Theodore Roosevelt Jackson.
[77:16.08]I had to make sure to get that out.
[77:19.06]They've been in all the games.
[77:20.14]They're heartbeats since the past 10 years, so I really appreciate my family and use them appropriately.
[77:26.53]I'm not a comedian, but I try to play one sometimes.
[77:32.43]Rockstar, my surrogate family.
[77:34.77]I severely underestimated that.
[77:37.91]And this guy came in and did the most beautiful, sad,
[77:43.92]music.
[77:44.64]Thank you so much.
[77:47.31]Alright, my brother.
[77:49.83]Is that a cry?
[77:52.10]Not quite.
[77:52.52]I don't think so.
[78:00.03]No, that wasn't it.
[78:02.87]And speaking of score and soundtrack, I wanted to let you know I've got a new podcast series with Spotify.
[78:08.00]Six episodes called Score Points where I actually went behind the scenes and interviewed a lot of the composers nominated there, including Woody about... No, it's not a candy company.
[78:16.00]It's not a soda or candy.
[78:17.04]Fuck me.
[78:17.28]So lots of great stuff.
[78:21.90]Make sure to check that out tonight on Spotify.
[78:23.60]It's called Score Points.
[78:24.94]Right now, I'd like to recognize some other winners tonight in other major categories.
[78:29.22]The best audio design presented by Dolby, and these are the nominees in that category.
[78:34.20]Call of Duty Black Ops 4, Forza Horizon 4, God of War, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Red Dead Redemption 2.
[78:42.97]And the game award for best audio design goes to Red Dead Redemption 2.
[78:47.51]It's having a pretty good night.
[78:50.11]Alright, for best art direction, the nominees in this craft category are Assassin's Creed Odyssey, God of War, Octopath Traveler, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Return of the Obra Dinn.
[79:05.93]And the winner is Return of the Obra Dinn.
[79:09.78]Congratulations to Lucas Pope, who I know is here tonight.
[79:14.76]Next up, the category of best mobile game, and those nominees are Donut County, Florence, Fortnite, PUBG Mobile, and Reigns, Game of Thrones.
[79:25.89]They'll be boos if Fortnite wins.
[79:26.93]And the game award for best mobile game goes to Florence.
[79:30.63]Oh, he said the F. He said the F. For Florence.
[79:39.50]Beat Saber, Firewall Zero Hour, Boss, and Tetris Effect.
[79:43.74]Beat Saber, right?
[79:44.36]And Astro Bot Rescue Mission is the winner for Best VR AR Game.
[79:47.75]Congratulations.
[79:49.21]Now on Twitch, everyone is voting right now to select who they think is going to win in major categories.
[79:53.56]Content Creator of the Year is coming up.
[79:56.14]And let's see what the Twitch poll is predicting it looks like.
[79:58.88]People are predicting that Ninja is going to win that one with 49% of the vote.
[80:03.72]We'll find out.
[80:04.36]Ninja's in the house, along with many other content creators.
[80:06.91]Alright.
[80:07.27]Well, next up, Warframe.
[80:08.79]It's had its biggest year yet.
[80:10.29]It just launched Fortuna, the newest open world expansion on PC, and it's coming to Xbox and PS4 on December 10th.
[80:17.33]That's some breaking news.
[80:18.49]And for the first time ever, you can play Warframe anywhere on the Switch.
[80:21.55]Warframe did come out on the Switch.
[80:22.65]Warframe for Nintendo Switch.
[80:24.45]But it is a remake or a remaster, essentially, right?
[80:26.86]Or a re-release?
[80:32.77]I gotta get some more votes first.
[80:38.93]I hit the wrong button.
[80:39.69]I gotta get more votes for fucking best streamer on the platform.
[80:48.71]Two people voted.
[80:49.59]Right there.
[80:54.48]Somebody took it away and put it back on Ninja.
[81:04.93]I see 10.
[81:05.47]I see 10 just jumped up.
[81:07.66]Thank you guys.
[81:09.20]Thank you so much, everybody.
[81:12.08]Thank you.
[81:14.68]Wow.
[81:18.10]Warframe is good on mute.
[81:19.53]Yeah, but it's Warframe, but it's on Switch.
[81:25.07]Where do you vote?
[81:27.25]It doesn't matter.
[81:37.05]Yes, it does.
[81:43.72]I thought I knew why I came here.
[81:46.76]What is this for?
[81:52.69]You set the apocalypse in motion.
[81:55.73]Let's take a look at how we stand here, though.
[81:59.72]All we really need, listen, here we go, guys.
[82:02.26]Bingo is upon us.
[82:04.30]Somebody has to say revolutionary.
[82:06.40]Somebody has to get played off.
[82:09.26]Because they're on there too long.
[82:10.86]And somebody has to heckle somebody.
[82:12.14]Somebody has to heckle from the audience.
[82:15.82]That's bingo coming up.
[82:19.68]All we need is somebody to fall down, 10 people to accept an award, and then there's going to be a pop figurine in the shot somewhere.
[82:51.78]That's a Fortnite dance, right?
[83:03.35]What was that?
[83:03.93]Was that Saw?
[83:08.75]What video game is this?
[83:10.75]Is this Freddy Krueger chasing the mummy in a video game?
[83:18.75]What was that?
[83:19.21]No, no, what was that one?
[83:20.11]What was that one that I wanted to see?
[83:22.85]Freddy Krueger!
[83:30.29]It's got them all!
[83:31.73]It's got everybody!
[83:32.67]What game is this?
[83:40.05]Just chase it!
[83:41.39]D'oh!
[83:43.10]Dead by Daylight.
[83:47.19]Why was I describing?
[83:48.35]Whatever.
[83:48.79]I'm here with Matt Cote.
[83:49.85]He's the game director for Dead by Daylight.
[83:51.57]We just saw that.
[83:52.29]Matt, welcome to the Game Awards.
[83:54.01]Thank you very much.
[83:54.87]It's such an honor to be here.
[83:56.33]Dead by Daylight.
[83:57.17]Lots of Canadian, Montreal teams up here, which I'd love to see in my home country, Canada.
[84:01.33]I hear you've got some big plans for the game, right?
[84:03.64]That's true.
[84:04.38]I mean, we plan to keep this game alive.
[84:06.30]Where's the fucking Captain America video game?
[84:09.08]Our dedication, essentially, tonight we're announcing the dedicated servers are coming to Dead by Daylight this summer.
[84:15.37]Okay, summer 2019.
[84:16.11]Yep.
[84:18.19]And I also want to show the trailer for the very first time for our new chapter coming to Dead by Daylight, Darkness Among Us.
[84:25.13]Okay, let's take a look at that.
[84:26.52]Another world premiere.
[84:27.38]Thanks so much.
[84:28.04]That's more than five.
[84:35.00]Who's the new character in Dead by Daylight Brothers?
[84:40.48]Who's the new confirmed character?
[84:54.35]What is that?
[84:55.09]That's not even a fucking horror movie character.
[84:57.83]Who is that?
[84:58.29]Is that like from some one-off one-off fucking movie?
[85:10.85]What one-off fucking horror movie is that from?
[85:20.84]Should've put the mummy in.
[85:23.02]I'm back here now with Casey Hudson, the general manager at BioWare, another Canadian company.
[85:26.60]It's the Canada section.
[85:27.51]That's right.
[85:28.23]Alright, well, you're almost done with Anthem, Casey.
[85:30.57]Tell us, where are you at?
[85:31.17]It's coming early next year, right?
[85:33.01]Yeah, it's coming out in February.
[85:34.49]And so we've got, you know, Mark Darrah and the team are doing an incredible job finishing it up.
[85:38.98]It's almost done.
[85:40.60]And, yeah, we're super happy to be here and be able to show a little bit more of the game tonight.
[85:44.81]So what are we going to start crying?
[85:46.73]Well, so a lot of what we've shown so far is the gameplay.
[85:50.00]It's super fun.
[85:50.92]You're basically, you know, an armored superhero in a fantasy setting.
[85:54.30]And we've shown a lot of that.
[85:55.52]We haven't really let people in on what the story is and the characters and things like that.
[85:59.50]But, you know, like a great Bioware game, we're building out a whole world of story and things for you to discover and characters to meet.
[86:05.87]So we're going to start letting you in on a little bit more of that.
[86:08.77]I know the entire team is working very hard on this, right?
[86:12.34]Yeah, I mean, we've got a big team working on it, but we've got a few projects at BioWare, so it's not the only thing that we're working on.
[86:18.14]And so we do have a few surprises left.
[86:21.00]Okay, but Anthem right now?
[86:23.26]Anthem right now, and always thinking about our next thing.
[86:26.25]Alright, I tried.
[86:27.27]Alright, here's a look at Anthem.
[86:29.35]Check it out.
[86:31.09]That was kind of awkward, but we already filled it in.
[86:33.37]Alright, world premiere of Anthem.
[86:35.94]That's not a world premiere, is it?
[86:40.45]Why is Anthem just Destiny?
[86:42.89]Is this just Destiny with Peter Dinklage in it?
[86:46.04]Wait, Destiny was Peter Dinklage.
[86:47.40]Did they make Destiny?
[86:48.80]They made Destiny, right?
[86:49.82]Did they?
[86:50.12]They did.
[86:50.64]So they did Halo, Destiny, which is kind of just...
[87:08.74]mummy in a game guys it's like halo look it's the flood the walls it's destiny our families where's the mummy loved ones remember we're a team I'm right there with you it's a freelancer job always has been but the anthems nobody ever thanks their mummy by the way which is bullshit
[87:32.79]You understand?
[87:34.75]And walls.
[87:36.35]Oops.
[87:36.67]Can only do so much.
[87:37.99]Oh, fuck.
[87:38.61]I've ruined it.
[87:39.09]No, I didn't.
[87:39.83]I'm fine.
[87:41.29]But with the power of the anthem at my fingertips, I will end all this needless suffering.
[88:01.28]Yeah.
[88:02.90]Anthem.
[88:04.30]Play it at your funeral.
[88:05.26]That game's DOA.
[88:19.59]This game's probably gonna be fun.
[88:24.13]You're not mic'd up.
[88:24.87]Nobody can hear you guys.
[88:35.34]Nothing.
[88:35.60]There's nothing here though.
[88:40.48]Trained animal used.
[88:41.86]Fire alarm.
[88:42.44]Fortnite dance.
[88:43.08]I already got Fortnite dance.
[88:45.38]Somebody in a costume.
[88:48.39]Guy sleeping in the audience.
[88:49.59]We might get a chance here.
[89:01.42]Why do I even have a new Banjo-Kazooie game on here?
[89:04.82]Is there more than two bald guys on stage?
[89:08.62]Oh, fuck me.
[89:09.74]Hold on a second here.
[89:10.74]Hold on.
[89:12.16]There are at least four guys that are bald on stage.
[89:18.15]One, two, three, four, fill it in!
[89:31.70]So close to a bingo.
[89:32.36]What do you mean that doesn't count?
[89:35.22]Two or more bald guys.
[89:37.60]That's it.
[89:38.29]That doesn't matter.
[89:41.29]They're on the stage.
[89:42.37]That counts.
[89:43.56]The Game Awards continues.
[89:45.25]Everybody is here tonight, including Crash Bandicoot.
[89:48.79]What's going on?
[89:49.77]CB in the house.
[89:51.23]What are you doing here?
[89:52.81]Not much, man.
[89:53.69]Just thought you deserved a trophy of your own.
[89:57.13]Thank you very much, Crash.
[89:58.17]This is the standard issue Crash crate.
[90:00.54]How do I open this thing?
[90:01.30]I think maybe give it a good spin.
[90:02.80]Somebody in a fucking costume.
[90:04.18]I got a long show to host.
[90:05.38]I'm just going to open it very professionally here on Game's biggest night.
[90:07.86]That's good.
[90:08.26]That's good.
[90:09.56]This might happen.
[90:10.36]What's this?
[90:10.96]This kind of looks familiar.
[90:13.24]Does it now?
[90:14.14]Booyah, Grandma.
[90:15.89]Booyah.
[90:16.35]Kingdom Hearts.

[90:22.19]What?
[90:30.03]Check out the premiere for Crash Team Racing.
[90:36.52]Crash is back.
[90:38.46]That's not Banjo-Kazooie.
[90:39.70]Shit, I mean, it could be.
[90:41.70]Hold on a second here, guys.
[90:42.64]They're the same color scheme.
[90:45.36]Crash Bandicoot is like a bear with orange fur.
[90:48.81]Right?
[90:50.81]Does that count?
[90:55.32]They're both bears, they're both orange.
[91:04.15]Crash Bandicoot has like a Pinocchio nose.
[91:05.84]That's the only difference.
[91:07.20]That is the only difference.
[91:08.30]They have the same color shorts on.
[91:09.38]They have the same color shorts on.
[91:11.95]The only difference is the Pinocchio nose, Crash.
[91:30.96]Yeah, it's the same character.
[91:32.17]It just shorts on, he's a bear, he's fucking orange.
[91:36.21]I'm gonna count that one.
[91:36.97]I'd count that.
[91:38.03]There are two of the voices from God of War.
[91:40.92]Please welcome Sonny Soljic and Christopher Judge.
[91:57.72]Oh, okay, it's the voices.
[91:58.84]Games have always had a strong sense of community.
[92:01.86]I remember when I was a kid.
[92:04.04]That's a fucking booming voice.
[92:06.68]Younger, gathering around someone at the arcade who was close to breaking a high score.
[92:12.95]But I'm blown away by how much bigger that community is in today's connected age.
[92:20.83]Millions of people around the world aren't just playing games they love.
[92:24.28]They're watching their favorite online personality stream for hours at a time.
[92:29.08]These are the nominees for the Content Creator of the Year.
[92:35.04]Come on!
[92:35.36]Content Creator of the Year.
[92:38.82]That's not me.
[92:39.54]Oh, my God!
[92:40.93]Charlie!
[92:41.75]Charlie!
[92:44.11]There we go.
[92:45.03]What's the stream?
[92:48.53]Oh.
[92:50.15]Me!
[92:50.47]Whoa!
[93:20.19]And the game award goes to... Heckler!
[93:30.17]That's a Heckler!
[93:31.17]Read it, boy.
[93:42.04]What?
[93:42.70]Who is that?
[93:43.22]What's that Twitch name?
[93:44.42]The award goes to Ninja.
[94:07.03]I'm not going to lie, this is an incredible honor.
[94:09.09]I would first off just like to thank my lovely wife, Jessica, who's joining me today, and my family who's supported me my entire life.
[94:16.94]They've always let me play video games, as long as I was just a little bit more active outside.
[94:23.75]But, you know, this has just been an incredible year for gaming and video games.
[94:28.71]And I'm just honestly blessed to be in the position that I'm in to have won this award and to bring joy to all the people who love watching video games.
[94:35.81]So, I mean, I think it's crazy that every single person in this room and every single person watching, it's all because of video games.
[94:45.41]So, I mean, here's to another incredible year, 2019.
[94:48.89]Thank you guys so much.
[94:50.17]I appreciate it.
[94:53.72]And yes, I respect my fellow nominee for winning instead of me.
[94:58.88]It's hard to believe it's been 20 years since we made Fallout and 13 years since we last worked together at Troika.
[95:13.34]Yeah, and it's great to be reunited on a new single-player RPG.
[95:16.94]We're very excited to reveal our brand new game and our brand new universe, The Outer Worlds.
[95:21.79]We hope you enjoy it.
[95:23.05]Oh, wait.
[95:23.93]Hold on a second.
[95:24.53]You were supposed to say that, remember?
[95:26.71]Yeah.
[95:28.01]What we're supposed to say is by watching this trailer, you are legally obligated to enjoy it.
[95:33.01]Thank you.
[95:33.91]Thank you.
[95:34.15]Oh, I just broke my neck.
[95:36.51]I just broke my neck.
[95:37.71]I think I just broke my neck.
[95:39.63]I dog-tilted so much, I think I just broke my neck.
[95:53.27]Destiny 3!
[96:11.28]What is this?
[96:12.20]I wasn't paying any attention.
[96:13.06]Welcome to the edge of the galaxy, the frontier of space.
[96:17.60]Well, at least it was until the corporations bought it, rented it, and started selling it at ludicrously inflated prices.
[96:24.14]BioShock Lands 3.
[96:25.12]And the rest of your fellow settlers abandoned on the edge of the colony.
[96:29.59]I'd save them myself, but the boars got a bounty on my head.
[96:33.55]Survival Wasteland game.
[96:35.03]That's why I thought you out.
[96:36.71]You appear capable.
[96:40.62]Look, I get it.
[96:42.60]Taking on the corporation has left us with two choices.
[96:44.44]Taking on the corporation.
[96:45.46]Bad and worse.
[96:47.56]Oh, those fucking corporations.
[96:50.43]And you have to choose now.
[96:51.63]Let me tell you something about those fucking corporations.
[96:56.41]You know you didn't have to shoot either one, right?
[97:00.01]But it's fine, I guess.
[97:01.77]You just keep being you.
[97:07.23]Okay, okay, I'm stuck like this.
[97:17.21]I can't move!
[97:41.04]Spacer's Choice is not responsible for any feeling of vertigo, wonder or hunger you may have experienced while watching this advertisement.
[97:48.21]They thought that was funny.
[97:48.85]They were laughing at me.
[97:52.35]So is that going to be like good Fallout?
[97:55.97]That's probably going to be fucking really good.
[97:57.97]Because that's like Fallout, but it's supposed to be actually Fallout.
[98:06.30]That's like a Fallout game by the guys that made the good Fallout, right?
[98:15.10]I'm excited.
[98:16.24]I got fucking bog stuck, you know what I mean?
[98:19.04]It happens sometimes.
[98:19.86]Gotta be careful.
[98:20.56]That's the League of Legends Riot Games development for Monster Hunter: World that's in alpha, right?
[98:43.92]Yeah, this is that Riot Games presents.
[98:48.41]Monster Hunter.
[98:48.99]Now, it's not a MOBA.
[99:06.22]This is actually an action game.
[99:11.82]And then they take the loot from his teeth.
[99:13.96]Right, I told you.
[99:15.08]Where's the Jerm of prediction?
[99:16.04]Fuck, I think the map is on screen.
[99:35.28]Now here from Dauntless is...
[99:38.08]Mike, Mike.
[99:39.10]We're here with Jesse Houston, the CEO of Phoenix Labs.
[99:41.72]A couple years ago, you were with us announcing this game, Jesse, and now you're back.
[99:45.68]We sure are, and it's been quite a couple of years.
[99:48.18]It was a heckler.
[99:49.60]We're super excited to not only talk about
[99:52.25]the last couple years, but also the future.
[99:54.05]And, you know, it's really awesome coming into the future and being able to see, in April rather, and launch the game on Xbox and PS4 and the Epic platform.
[100:04.28]You know, from the get-go, Dauntless has always been about bringing players together, making friends, and killing big behemoths.
[100:11.28]And, you know, those platforms are going to be kind of the next big journey for us.
[100:15.14]And tonight, you got something launching too, right?
[100:16.80]We sure do.
[100:17.32]So it's our biggest content expansion pack, Frostfall, drops today on PC at PlayDotList.com.
[100:22.59]Alright, well, check it out.
[100:23.71]PlayDotList.
[100:24.31]Thank you very much, Jesse.
[100:25.67]Alright, we'll be right back after this.
[100:31.81]Sorry.
[100:33.48]When I was growing up, I didn't see any women doing a lot of bigger things in my life.
[100:38.06]But you can play that game right now.
[100:40.66]So even the girls' education is not like the top priority.
[100:45.02]I thought you had to be like invited to the Alpha or something.
[100:48.08]It was difficult for me to pursue this, to make money, to be able to afford the private school so that I can go and study computer science.
[100:55.95]Getting education, it's not about just getting a degree.
[100:58.47]It's actually getting exposure to the world.
[101:03.54]If you can't be, if you can't see.
[101:06.42]That's what we are trying to do is give them an inspiration.
[101:10.60]Pixel Art Games Academy is a training academy for video game development.
[101:15.35]Our main focus is actually empowering game developers and creative artists to be able to make their own game ideas.
[101:24.55]This is my biggest dream.
[101:26.49]I want people to see what kind of ideas, what kind of creative people we have in Pakistan.
[101:30.77]Thank you.
[101:36.04]Welcome to the guy that lost top streamer on stream.
[101:40.02]Thank you.
[101:40.95]Oh, I should have put him on here.
[101:44.55]I was gonna put him on like Joel McHale shows up.
[101:49.17]I mean, like, honestly, like, I don't know, but was I shit-faced when I made this?
[101:54.16]No one's gonna fucking fight on stage.
[101:55.70]Hold on, wait a minute, we got Smash Brothers Brawl.
[102:11.76]Super Smash Brothers Ultimate!
[102:15.06]I hope you have the stamina!
[102:17.06]Because the game's about to be in stock!
[102:19.84]And it's almost time!
[102:25.36]Welcome to my store.
[102:27.82]It's one not bound by walls.
[102:33.06]No, this is... Everybody has seen this fucking commercial.
[102:35.85]You know what I'm saying?
[102:38.05]Everybody's seen that commercial.
[102:40.41]I don't put ads on my stream.
[102:42.70]Never.
[102:42.98]You'll never see an ad on my... I mean, I can't control pre-rolls because I can't turn them off, I don't think.
[102:47.12]But you'll never see an ad.
[102:48.18]I don't play ads on the stream.
[102:52.99]You haven't seen?
[102:54.57]Good.
[102:55.07]Oh, you haven't seen that commercial?
[102:56.83]You haven't seen that commercial?
[102:58.03]That commercial was on TV like seven years ago.
[103:03.11]Seven months ago.
[103:03.92]Whatever.
[103:04.50]This is Artifact.
[103:07.86]No, it's not.
[103:14.16]Tonight, we've got some of the biggest franchises in the world unveiling their new games.
[103:17.69]We've also got some smaller studios sharing their projects.
[103:20.65]This is another one of those... Boomer watches TV.
[103:27.67]Is there any... An ember drips from the flame.
[103:39.36]Life is Strange.
[103:42.38]Life is Strange.
[103:47.88]Why are you telling me to skip this?
[103:49.21]I don't have control over this.
[103:50.25]Skip the game?
[103:51.05]I can't.
[103:51.59]This is the No Man's Sky development.
[104:18.34]I made a puzzle game.
[104:22.94]Okay.
[104:25.39]I wonder if after this trailer they're gonna say this is the greatest video game to ever be made.
[104:31.25]Mean streamer?
[104:32.67]No, I'm just kidding!
[104:34.69]It's a joke!
[104:55.11]That looks kind of good Let me like backtrack a little
[105:25.44]Oh, No Man's Sky was terrible.
[105:27.42]Those developers were fucking, what the hell were they thinking?
[105:29.92]Oh, this game looks kind of good.
[105:32.32]Elijah Wood!
[105:34.16]No.
[105:39.06]Yeah.
[105:39.98]Hi, Jeff.
[105:41.42]Wow, I can't believe you got me back.
[105:43.22]Uh...
[105:45.34]When I was asked to present the award for best esports player, I did not hesitate.
[105:50.86]Video games have brought me and my sons closer together.
[105:55.66]Every morning, they fire up Shocker, Fortnite, and their eyes light up with the promise of a new day, and they demand my credit card information.
[106:07.07]And you give it to them, Joel.
[106:08.95]You give it to them, Joel.
[106:11.53]You forgot that part of the presentation.
[106:13.41]They were forcing me to buy a Rainbow Rider and Astro Backplane.
[106:17.24]They grow up so fast.
[106:18.26]Anyway.
[106:18.88]He cried.
[106:20.84]Esports continue to grow exponentially every year with sold-out arena tournaments all over the world and millions of dollars on the line.
[106:28.77]This award recognizes the most dominant athlete in esports.
[106:33.33]Whomever wins this is basically the LeBron James of sitting.
[106:40.80]It's amazing.
[106:41.76]Here are the nominees.
[106:45.16]Best Esports Player, presented by Omen by HP.
[106:49.06]It doesn't matter what fighting game he's playing, this kid can do it, can take it all.
[106:55.43]Sonic Box, the champ.
[107:00.70]Fighting game, fighting game.
[107:01.98]Here's your champion.
[107:09.07]We want more championship, right?
[107:10.71]The best player in the world.
[107:15.47]That was great.
[107:16.07]That was too far back.
[107:17.56]I don't know.
[107:18.32]That is stunning from S1mple.
[107:21.06]That was pretty good.
[107:22.52]You're looking dangerous.
[107:24.38]From downtown.
[107:33.94]There's a Rubik's Cube guy.
[107:35.93]Where's the Rubik's Cube guy?
[107:37.59]The guy that can like... You know what I mean?
[107:41.17]Who the fuck is that guy?
[107:53.27]This guy in a costume.
[107:56.29]We already have that selected.
[108:09.67]I really want to say this is a big honor.
[108:20.97]I kind of just really, really enjoy playing video games competitively.
[108:26.62]I've never really, really done it for the fame.
[108:28.60]I kind of just
[108:29.79]enjoy the rush of like beating people up, you know?
[108:32.73]Like, I don't know, like even like, I'm sure you guys heard the story of when I won the IPS finale.
[108:40.12]The other thing I don't do this for is for the money.
[108:41.74]It's because when my best friend, my best friend, one of my closest friends, oh my God, I'm nervous.
[108:49.22]His dad had cancer, and after I won, before I even, like, did the match, I told him, whether I win or lose, I'm going to be donating at least, like, 10K of the prize winning to his father for his stage three cancer.
[109:01.14]Pretty fucking awesome.
[109:02.06]I hope it works out for him.
[109:04.83]And he really, really... That's a pretty nice fucking thing to do.
[109:10.61]I'm so nervous!
[109:11.45]I'm so nervous.
[109:11.91]It's more scary than I want Evo.
[109:14.57]But, I mean, I guess...
[109:18.44]I had always just done it just to make new friends and bonds in the community.
[109:23.23]So I guess for now, I want to give a shout out to, obviously, the team that's helped me through all the way, Uncle Fox.
[109:29.59]I want to give a shout out to all my friends back at home, my best friend at Kill Sage.
[109:36.44]He's helped me out so much through life.
[109:39.42]McKenna and Black, the goons back at home, gang, gang.
[109:44.98]Um, uh, as you guys also may know or may not know, um, I'm also super gay.
[109:50.02]So, I mean, uh, I want to give a shout-out.
[109:57.71]So... So, I want to give a super shout-out to all my LGBTQ plus friends that have always come into life.
[110:06.51]Um, obviously, I'm a furry, so shout-out to the furries.
[110:08.96]The furries.
[110:09.72]Yeah.
[110:09.86]Um...
[110:13.74]Guess all I gotta really say is that I'm gay, black, a furry, pretty much everything a Republican hates, and the best esports player of the whole year, I guess.
[110:23.29]Thank you so much.
[110:30.13]I'll tell you one thing, right?
[110:33.07]That's pretty smart, if you're nervous to give a speech or talk on stage.
[110:37.21]There's one thing that you need to remember.
[110:38.65]If you can cover your face or cover your eyes, it's actually easier to do it in costume or in character.
[110:45.30]I don't know if that makes sense.
[110:54.51]Does that actually make sense?
[110:57.77]Easier to talk publicly.
[111:04.85]Don't eat those pills.
[111:05.53]Don't eat the pills.
[111:06.07]Don't eat the pills, bird.
[111:06.92]Don't eat the pills, bird.
[111:10.42]Don't eat the pills, bird.
[111:15.92]Nobody's fallen down yet.
[111:17.72]How has nobody said the word revolutionary?
[111:19.57]Is that impossible?
[111:24.11]Dead bird.
[111:24.77]Okay.
[111:32.87]Winter has arrived.
[111:34.43]The winds of winter!
[111:35.77]Oh, it's PUBG.
[111:37.85]That's not a world premiere.
[111:40.55]That's a PUBG video game.
[111:48.90]No revolutionary.
[111:50.58]No fist bump.
[111:52.90]No cutting edge.
[111:55.68]Nobody's visibly drunk.
[111:57.28]Alright.
[111:58.30]I am here with Dave Curd, the world art director at PUBG Corporation.
[112:01.76]Dave, why don't you tell us about the new map, besides the new terrain.
[112:05.59]People can get to play tonight.
[112:06.69]What else?
[112:07.63]Except for me.
[112:09.13]It's our first 6x6 map, which is the sweet spot between the chaos of Sanic and the tactics of Erangel.
[112:16.37]It's also a snow map, which means you leave footprints.
[112:19.79]Players can track you.
[112:20.93]You can track them.
[112:22.09]Hunter becomes the hunted.
[112:24.11]What about new gear this time around?
[112:25.93]Absolutely.
[112:26.39]We're going to have the G36C assault rifle and a very fast, very new badass snowmobile to explore the map in.
[112:34.00]OK, Snowmobile, and we're going to get to jump that Snowmobile tonight.
[112:36.82]Can you put them on the test servers after the show?
[112:38.70]Yeah, it's the best news.
[112:39.54]It's ready tonight.
[112:40.70]PC test servers, and it's going to be on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in January.
[112:45.89]Alright, so jump on Steam tonight for that.
[112:48.59]And also, the PS4 version hits tomorrow, right?
[112:51.49]Yeah, tomorrow, December 7th.
[112:52.51]Any food references?
[112:53.73]We're super excited to join the PlayStation community.
[112:55.79]No food references.
[112:56.51]All of our new PS4 players are going to receive an exclusive parachute.
[113:00.51]And finally, it's your last chance to pre-order
[113:02.87]which will grant the Nathan Drake desert outfit from the Uncharted series, and Ellie's backpack from The Last of Us.
[113:09.02]Get it!
[113:10.22]Alright, fantastic, Dave.
[113:11.48]Really appreciate it.

[113:42.83]Am I like out of my mind?
[113:48.30]Also, if you have any religious artifacts, put those away.
[113:51.14]Just tuck them under your seats, because we're about to summon some dark spirits.
[113:55.66]Here's the composer of Devil May Cry 5, Casey Edwards, with vocals by Ali Edwards.
[114:01.33]Are we going to get a full song here?
[114:02.95]Devil Trigger!
[114:04.53]We're going to get a full song.
[114:07.59]Didn't put full performed song on here.

[115:44.53]How am I supposed to stop?
[115:46.84]Okay, everybody, that's it.
[115:48.00]Game Awards are canceled.
[115:49.68]Turbo985 said to do something else.
[115:59.25]Wait, what?
[115:59.81]Am I supposed to, like, snap my fingers and all of a sudden there's another thing on the screen?
[116:21.81]I should have put tongue on there.
[116:28.21]Fire could have been on here.
[116:33.20]Comb your hair until it's over.
[116:48.38]I love that going all the way up and all the way down.
[117:32.07]Oh, I just like boogered.
[117:35.85]You didn't- did you see- hold on.
[117:39.01]Did boogers just come out of my nose?
[117:41.30]I think they did.
[117:46.08]Fuck.
[117:47.36]Whatever, it was trans- you didn't see anything.
[117:50.82]This is not the right fucking headphones.
[118:06.85]Sea of Thieves.
[118:14.23]It was a Wilhelm.
[118:16.17]Could have put that on there.
[118:17.91]What is even on there?
[118:19.37]We need revolutionary, somebody to get the music, and we need somebody to heckle the winner.
[118:24.45]We get Bingo.
[118:24.85]Or somebody to fall down, ten people accepting an award, and a pop figurine.
[118:32.16]We're also pretty close to Miyamoto live via satellite and somebody dropping the microphone.
[118:49.53]We would make some ground if Elijah Wood showed up.
[118:56.43]This is definitely not going to be a trained animal used in any presentation.
[119:02.00]Alright, I'm here with Jeremy and Jesse from Wild Card Studios.
[119:04.70]Guys, congratulations on the announcement tonight.
[119:07.06]Coming next week, what exactly is Atlas?
[119:09.26]Geno's not going to dispatch.
[119:11.88]Open world survival MMO for 40,000 concurrent players in the same environment.
[119:17.25]It's a game about building an armada, claiming territory, forming an empire, and ultimately dominating the entire globe.
[119:24.67]It's a huge scale.
[119:26.27]How big is the map?
[119:27.89]It's really big.
[119:29.01]The Atlas world is 1,200 times the size of a single Ark server.
[119:33.39]And our team has spent countless hours hand crafting a beautiful place to play in with biomes from tropics to tundra, desert, polar regions.
[119:41.74]And we filled it with amazing creatures.
[119:43.96]Everything from things you would expect, like livestock, to crazy mythological creatures that are guarding the secrets of an ancient civilization.
[119:51.71]There's so much fun stuff to see and do in Atlas.
[119:54.19]And it's just going to be awesome to engage in.
[119:57.05]Amazing.
[119:57.57]Well, coming to PC, any word coming to console yet?
[120:00.64]Amazing.
[120:01.52]Awesome.
[120:01.82]Alice will be coming to console next year to Xbox.
[120:04.08]Revolutionary.
[120:04.94]Xbox Game Preview program.

[120:13.13]Awesome.
[120:13.41]Alright.
[120:13.61]Well, thanks, guys.
[120:14.25]I know lots of work ahead in the week ahead to launch it.
[120:16.75]We really appreciate it.
[120:18.05]We've also got our Twitch poll continuing.
[120:21.51]So the award for best independent game, people have been voting on that.
[120:24.14]That's coming up in the show.
[120:25.12]And right now, Twitch is saying that they think Dead Cells is going to take that with 39% of the vote.
[120:29.66]So we'll find out if they're right when we come back.
[120:34.32]That was great.
[120:36.51]On the way, a world premiere you won't want to miss.
[120:40.35]Then Ninja and Pepe the King Prawn present the award for best independent game.
[120:45.72]And later, we celebrate the music of Red Dead Redemption 2.

[120:51.74]This is the Game Awards.
[120:53.52]Are they talking about the Muppet?
[120:57.04]Are they talking about the Muppet?
[121:03.87]Is that actually going to happen?
[121:10.43]That's the only thing I care about for the rest of the time we're streaming.
[121:26.13]Too loud, blame them, not me.
[121:36.94]Does Pepe the King Prawn count as a trained animal?
[121:41.58]I think about that counts.
[121:43.05]That counts as a trained animal.
[121:48.32]That's a trained animal.
[121:49.94]Yeah.
[121:50.62]Get rid of the filament.

[128:19.04]Oh, I'm gonna get some big V-Bucks for this, okay.
[128:22.76]That's a, uh, that's a fork knife reference.
[128:27.08]Uh, did you say fork knife?
[128:28.88]It's, uh, it's actually pronounced Fortnite.
[128:31.55]No, I don't think so.
[128:32.57]No, no, but believe me, definitely.
[128:34.99]I know, it's Fortnite, right guys?
[128:36.69]It's Fortnite.
[128:38.99]Well, I hate to disagree with everyone, but you're wrong.
[128:43.48]Fortnite makes no sense.
[128:45.63]Fortnite is only two weeks, and I know I've spent a lot more time than two weeks playing this game.
[128:51.59]Say sangria.
[128:53.01]Sangria?

[129:03.26]Okay, alright.
[129:04.66]This award is for the best game made outside of the AAA system.
[129:08.92]Oh, there's a good one.
[129:10.52]Oh, did you say AAA?
[129:11.46]Yeah, AAA.
[129:12.90]It's amazing what they do without batteries these days.
[129:16.40]And here are the nominees.
[129:17.66]Oh, nominees.
[129:20.67]Best independent game.

[129:32.17]Dead Cells.
[129:32.93]It's going to be Dead Cells.
[129:34.89]Dead Cells is going to win as many awards as Fred Kettering.
[129:44.58]We still need party chat actors.
[129:46.16]I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.
[129:57.38]They've been like on the ball this year.
[130:05.32]Alright.
[130:05.90]Drop it.
[130:06.78]Alright, and the award goes to... Ooh, he almost dropped it.
[130:09.14]Ninja, ninja, ninja.
[130:10.14]Hold on, my friend.
[130:11.08]Let's get one more big shelfie with a big crowd in the background, okay?
[130:14.54]Everybody, get crazy, scream, shelfie!
[130:17.84]Shelfie!
[130:21.20]And everybody's sleeping.
[130:21.96]Okay, my friend, continue, please.
[130:23.72]Alright, and now the best independent game goes to... Drop the award.
[130:28.40]I'll have to do this alone.
[130:29.84]It's hard.
[130:33.14]The award goes to Celeste.
[130:42.17]Tonight, Celeste also wins the Games for Impact award.
[130:46.11]I was just hoping he was going to drop it.
[130:52.55]That's a mic drop, right?
[130:53.95]One, two.
[130:54.13]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[131:03.35]Is it 10 people up there?
[131:04.31]There's a few team members who couldn't be here tonight.
[131:08.13]I don't know if that's 10.
[131:09.05]And I know they're watching.
[131:10.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[131:10.91]Gabby and Sven and the Power Up guys, we love you and we wish you were here.
[131:15.85]8.
[131:17.53]It's all 10.
[131:19.19]And...
[131:22.25]We're nothing without our support networks, so thanks to our partners and our family and our friends who are amazing.
[131:26.83]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[131:28.15]One, two, three, four, five.
[131:29.43]I can't count them.
[131:30.99]I can't count these.
[131:32.69]People on the stage.
[131:34.01]Hi, Mom and Dad, I love you.
[131:34.89]Or is it nine?
[131:37.29]Thank you for thanking Mom and Dad.
[131:38.68]We got completely lost in the work of making this game, and we kind of forgot that people would eventually play it, so the reception has just been really overwhelming.
[131:49.42]Ninja's on stage.
[131:51.10]And Jeff, right?
[131:52.24]That's 10.
[131:53.94]I'm at a loss for things to say all year about the reception.
[131:59.48]So there is one thing I want to say, though.
[132:02.57]If Celeste has helped you come to terms with mental illness, I just want to say that you deserve credit for that.
[132:15.05]That change came from inside of you, and you're capable of a lot more.
[132:18.75]Thank you.
[132:24.53]Go say it.
[132:30.27]Go say it.
[132:31.09]The prong doesn't count as a person.
[132:32.55]So that's got to be... That's nine.
[132:35.69]So it didn't happen.
[132:36.47]Sorry, guys.
[132:48.31]Yeah, that's... There was eight people on stage, plus Ninja, is nine.
[132:52.97]But the King Prawn, that's... I mean, maybe the guy... Actually, the guy that's got the hand up the prawn's ass, right?
[133:00.53]The guy, the puppeteer, right?
[133:03.15]That's ten.
[133:03.87]But that's not ten people that accepted the award.
[133:10.84]No, that doesn't count.
[133:13.84]Eight people accepted that award, not ten.
[133:26.84]This looks pretty good.
[133:29.16]What platform?
[133:56.12]The Pathless on iPad, iOS, and iPhone.
[134:04.52]Epic Store, they are really... Things are going to get real interesting in the next couple of years.
[134:10.75]We got a Muppet on the show finally, so I'm very personally happy.
[134:13.53]Pepe, thank you for joining us.
[134:15.53]Tonight you can find special offers on all the nominated games across Xbox, Nintendo eShop, Steam, and PlayStation Store, so make sure to check out those offers tonight and over the next few days.
[134:25.18]If people are going to be releasing their games exclusively on Twitter, many more surprises, having so much fun.
[134:30.52]Why did I lose?
[134:31.30]Where's like the I lost tweet, right?
[134:33.06]That's not a disgruntled nominee.
[134:34.52]If by interesting, you mean annoying.
[134:54.93]I mean, people are using it, though.
[134:56.17]That's the crazy part.
[134:56.99]It's like, it's getting exclusivity.
[134:59.45]It's gonna get really weird here in the next couple years.
[135:03.64]Is this like a MapleStory remake?
[135:06.90]What is this?
[135:30.80]It is now up to you, and probably many more of your descendants, to set forth on an epic journey to defeat this spreading plague that sours our land.

[136:22.34]And on most days, you can catch me streaming some games.
[136:24.44]But today I wanted to hop in at the Game Awards to talk about vaping and the simple fact that if you vape, you are four times more likely to smoke cigarettes.
[136:32.27]Now, everybody knows that smoking cigarettes is extremely bad for you.
[136:35.37]But how vaping can lead to smoking cigarettes may not be as obvious.
[136:38.99]The amount of nicotine in just one Juul pod is the same as 20 cigarettes.
[136:44.05]To learn more, go to thetruth.com to join the cause to finish smoking.
[136:47.55]That many people vaping?
[136:49.95]Is vaping like a fucking epidemic right now?
[136:55.50]We gotta talk about vaping.
[136:58.18]People are just going like this, you know what I mean?
[136:59.88]They're just like... Why is everybody vaping?
[137:04.40]Why do you gotta go like this?
[137:06.82]You know what I mean?
[137:08.58]Go like this.
[137:18.85]What's with the side like weird mouth thing?

[140:07.85]Yeah, what the fuck?
[140:11.28]I'm remembering from a couple hours ago.
[140:16.87]What the hell was that, like, let's get all the heads of all the companies on stage thing?
[140:23.66]That was really weird.
[140:26.06]It was like you got three villains on stage and they're all supposed to appear together and, like, the good guys are all backstage.
[140:32.25]You know what I mean?
[140:32.83]Just like, get out there and, like, make a presentation.
[140:34.85]It's like, what the hell was that?
[140:38.80]They, like, didn't belong on stage.
[140:40.04]It was weird.
[140:44.25]See the fire in your eyes Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
[140:59.68]Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on I've been living too fast, I've been living too wrong
[141:11.33]Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone.
[141:16.09]This big old world sure got me running around.
[141:22.19]I heard a voice.
[141:23.61]It told me settle down.
[141:28.13]With the moonlight as my guide and this feeling deep inside, I know now.
[141:52.48]I feel so, like, weird sitting here.
[141:55.12]I'm just like... What's up?
[141:56.64]I'm a guy in the audience.
[141:59.70]Yeah, but I'm drinking.
[142:02.38]You're getting drink here.
[142:40.39]Stand unshaken.
[142:44.16]On me amidst a crashing world.
[142:49.88]Oh, may I stand unshaken.
[142:56.46]On me amidst a crashing world.
[143:01.21]It's a great game.
[143:02.59]I stand unshaken.
[143:11.40]I've got to turn my back to the camera so I'm watching it.
[143:14.12]There's a fucking wall over here!
[143:48.19]You don't know what you're talking about.
[143:55.99]And he's got lice.
[144:08.69]Will you pay attention to the Game Awards, please?
[144:10.73]It only happens once a year.
[144:25.89]Stand up, shake up.
[144:29.35]Oh, bitch, I miss the crashy world.
[144:34.56]Hey, I stand up, shake up.
[144:39.90]Oh, bitch, I miss the crashy world.
[144:43.67]Hey, I stand up, shake up.
[144:56.88]Now go win another five awards guys
[145:22.26]Wow.
[145:23.32]Brianna and Daniel, thank you.
[145:24.51]That was absolutely beautiful.
[145:25.71]We want to thank the band for that amazing performance.
[145:28.79]It's always a thrill for me to bring the music from games to life on our stage, and I think we did it better than we've ever done it before.
[145:34.83]So thank you so much, guys, for doing that.
[145:36.77]Pretty good job.
[145:37.35]Right now, let's take a trip back to Hawkins, Indiana.
[145:43.77]We got to do this?
[145:45.15]Let's engage.
[145:47.87]This is a TV show?
[145:54.71]Uh... It doesn't count as actors because they're not pretending to be in a game with each other.
[146:02.22]You should go.
[146:02.74]It's almost here.
[146:14.99]Oh, I thought it was Elijah Wood.
[146:25.45]I thought we got Elijah Wood.
[146:26.91]Thank you, guys.
[146:27.53]No, that's not Elijah Wood.
[146:28.55]It is very cool to be here.
[146:29.97]We were, what, six years old when we received this brand new system called Nintendo for Christmas, and we've been gaming ever since.
[146:37.61]They both could be Elijah Wood, though.
[146:38.67]I think this has been a particularly incredible year for games, which is kind of unfortunate for Netflix, because playing your games has probably delayed a release by at least, what, a month, at least, for sure.
[146:49.67]But, I mean, Red Dead, God of War, Astro Bot, I mean, come on.
[146:52.91]It's incredible.
[146:53.91]Anyway, we're glad we could be here tonight to announce a new Stranger Things video game from Netflix and Bonus XP.
[146:59.44]It follows the events of Season 3 with a few surprises of its own, and you can play co-op on Xbox, Switch, and PC.
[147:06.02]And we've also made a big graphical leap this year.
[147:08.20]We're up to 16 bits, so watch out, Rockstar.
[147:11.84]Alright, let's take a look.
[147:12.56]16 bits.
[147:12.74]What does that mean?
[147:19.51]It's a Stranger Things Super Nintendo demake.
[147:38.85]I've never seen this show, so I don't understand any of this.
[147:41.83]I've never even... I haven't consumed one solitary second of this television show.
[147:52.18]I know that they play Dungeons & Dragons in the first ten minutes.
[147:56.14]And the show is about Dungeons & Dragons.
[147:58.70]And like, the D&D campaign like, turns real, right?
[148:02.25]They like, it's like the... Remember that old horror movie where the guy wrote on the typewriter?
[148:06.51]And everything he wrote on the typewriter became real?
[148:09.25]It's like a whole horror movie.
[148:10.25]It's like that, but their D&D campaign becomes real.
[148:14.14]Like, I don't know, whatever.
[148:27.36]What?
[148:28.38]Oh, they're doing like a meta thing.
[148:31.44]Do I have that on here?
[148:34.58]I'm not talking about Murder Sheep, bro.
[148:40.76]He's the creative director at NetherRealm Studios and the co-creator of Mortal Kombat and Injustice.
[148:47.47]Oh, yeah.
[148:48.03]Here's Ed Boon.
[148:49.39]There he is.
[148:50.21]What do you got for us, Ed?
[148:58.07]Thank you.
[148:59.37]It's great to be back here at the Game Awards.
[149:01.71]It's my honor tonight to present the award for best sports or racing game.
[149:06.83]Let's check out the nominees.
[149:10.14]Best sports racing game.
[149:13.28]It's not Elijah Wood.
[149:14.36]Stop it.
[149:15.38]That's Ed.
[149:17.46]I would say Ed Wood, but that was an old shitty movie director.
[149:23.68]Why is this one so elaborate?
[149:24.74]Why would... What's with the electricity?
[149:27.00]This is like... Indie game couldn't have gotten this?
[149:44.75]Oh, this is... It's a joke.
[149:47.04]Because this is Mortal Kombat 12.
[149:48.18]Okay.
[149:56.16]That's pretty good.
[149:57.94]Too bad it wasn't Madden.
[149:59.12]I thought I was playing Viagra.
[150:16.10]That sounded really unenthusiastic, but I actually think this is cool.
[150:21.61]It's hard, I'm...
[150:56.82]Holy shit.
[151:00.36]Mortal Kombat Battle Royale.
[151:03.10]Victory Royale for Raiden.
[151:04.61]Who is it?

[152:21.60]NBA 2K19, this same game came out last year.
[152:27.36]Wait, was this another soccer game?
[152:30.00]Were there two soccer games on there?
[152:32.87]And the game award goes to... Orzar Horizon 4.
[152:36.87]Can I vote for Mario Tennis?
[152:42.35]No, I didn't.
[152:53.77]I got FIFA best sports game of the year.
[152:57.13]Just like the last 30 years in a row, we've made one of these.
[153:00.69]What a visionary and legend.
[153:07.03]So there has been so many people working on the Forza franchise.
[153:11.83]It's a huge honor to accept this on their behalf.
[153:14.45]Forza Horizon 4 is now our best-selling Horizon game.
[153:17.97]Fuck, that was so audible.
[153:23.34]both by buying the game and playing it in Game Pass.
[153:26.74]And it's just been an incredible honor to watch.
[153:30.16]The team is working really hard, as you saw.
[153:32.50]We have a whole new update of Fortune Island coming on December 13th, and we're just getting started.
[153:37.86]So thank you.
[153:41.24]No, that guy wasn't drunk.
[153:47.99]That guy wasn't drunk.
[153:50.57]I want to tell you about a boy.
[153:52.77]Ooh, is it me?
[153:54.67]Please save your questions to the end, Rasputin.
[153:56.97]Okay.
[154:00.10]Psychonauts 2.
[154:00.72]He was a talented acrobat, but also a gifted psychic.
[154:06.14]Don't forget my canoeing badge.
[154:08.52]He was a big pain in the neck.
[154:11.18]Didn't they kickstart this game for like $400 million?
[154:13.70]Let him into the Psychonauts.
[154:16.55]Is this a remake or a sequel?
[154:18.38]Sequel.
[154:43.18]It's always protecting itself from outsiders.
[154:46.56]It's fair share of dangerous, hidden secrets.
[154:50.16]If they ever got out, things would never be the same again for the Psychonauts.
[154:56.27]For your friends.
[154:57.11]For your family.
[155:01.69]For you.
[155:02.67]Listen, Rasputin.
[155:04.13]There are doors that should never be opened.
[155:06.96]Not all mines are safe to read.
[155:08.78]Some brains are better off...
[155:14.30]Don't worry.
[155:15.34]I won't do anything crazy.
[155:21.77]Wasn't the original game any good?
[155:23.81]Well, whatever you do, just leave me out of it.
[155:26.75]Oh, is that honey pepper ball bacon?
[155:30.25]I always thought Psychonauts was like a brain training game.
[155:37.10]You know, where you look at the stylus and you do math problems every day.
[155:45.81]Apparently not.
[155:48.85]Psychonauts, too.
[155:49.54]First announcer a couple years ago, Tim Schafer.
[155:51.44]Thinking of you, great to see you next year, I hope.
[155:53.58]Tim Schafer!
[155:54.42]Oh, no, that's not Tim Schafer.
[155:56.10]We saw you at the top of the show.
[155:57.78]That's Phil.
[155:58.22]With your new buddies, Reggie and Phil.
[155:59.66]Your longtime buddies, Reggie and Phil, right?
[156:01.09]Yeah, no, really.
[156:01.77]Sean.
[156:02.51]You deserve credit for putting that moment together with Reggie, Sean, and I.
[156:06.07]You pushed to make that happen.
[156:07.19]I think it's great to show the industry coming together.
[156:09.27]And Jeff did that.
[156:10.63]I don't know.
[156:11.09]Why is that a big deal?
[156:11.99]Thank you, Phil.
[156:12.51]Yeah, we all stood in a row for 30 seconds.
[156:15.20]Yeah, it was really ridiculous.
[156:16.56]I've never been in the same room before as Reggie in my life.
[156:19.60]It's been a big year for Xbox.
[156:20.92]How?
[156:21.38]You got allowed to be in the same room?
[156:23.82]How's 18 been going for you guys?
[156:25.48]Yeah, we had a pretty good year.
[156:26.50]We can do better.
[156:27.70]We had a pretty good year.
[156:29.27]Added some studios, shipped some good games, Sea of Thieves shipped, State of Decay.
[156:33.33]Forza Horizon was great to see Forza Horizon 4 win an award.
[156:37.94]Shipped the adaptive controller this last year, something I'm very proud of.
[156:43.27]No, it's been a good year and news coming about Xbox.
[156:46.54]We saw the guys from Studio Wildcard up here.
[156:48.58]Atlas coming next year to Game Preview, right?
[156:50.82]Yeah, I mean, we have a long relationship with Studio Wildcard.
[156:53.29]They were one of our earlier Game Preview teams.
[156:56.19]Game Preview really helps developers, always trying to build programs to help developers.
[156:59.95]Our ID at Xbox program, Game Pass, I mean, all these things just to help developers reach as many gamers as possible.
[157:06.53]Well, speaking of Game Pass, let's talk about that.
[157:09.64]What can you tell us about Game Pass?
[157:10.96]Seems like everything is coming to Game Pass now, right?
[157:13.06]Phil Spencer is not drunk.
[157:14.56]Phil Spencer is not drunk.
[157:15.26]You're not going to get that one.
[157:17.32]It's very obvious.
[157:21.41]It's incredible.
[157:22.41]People are going to go play that game.
[157:23.65]Below next week.
[157:24.33]Below next week.
[157:25.85]Kingdoms II Crowns next week.

[157:28.79]All part of Winter of Arcade.
[157:30.09]We mentioned bringing Winter of Arcade back.
[157:32.21]It's great to have all those games coming and launching both for sale and into Game Pass.
[157:36.40]Get as many players as we can.
[157:37.88]I love you guys supporting the smaller studios.
[157:39.40]Same thing with me here at the awards.
[157:40.40]We want the big games and the small games, and that's what makes this industry so vibrant.
[157:43.52]See, Dead Cells up.
[157:44.64]Dead Cells, such a good game.
[157:45.84]I know.
[157:46.12]Congratulations to those guys for winning their award.
[157:49.53]2019, obviously lots of big stuff coming from you guys.

[158:04.24]Seeing the next Ori come out.

[158:52.11]Go ahead and miss it.
[158:52.97]And right now, let's take a look at some brand new stuff from Devil May Cry.
[159:03.98]No, nobody's cried.
[159:06.36]You guys have seen this trailer already, haven't you?
[159:09.84]We need to stay to the board, you know what I mean?
[159:14.52]You've never seen this.
[159:18.76]What evil lurks?
[159:21.72]I think we need to stay to the board.
[159:23.00]I must destroy.
[159:24.20]Alright, time to kick some ass.
[159:32.01]V, why don't you tell me everything about this job?
[159:34.98]A powerful demon is about to resurrect and we need your help, Dante.
[159:48.02]Alright, stay to the port.
[159:51.80]What do you say?
[159:53.50]Unless something else happens here.
[159:54.42]Games play best on Xbox One.
[159:56.18]Alright, we need Miyamoto appearance.
[159:59.94]We need somebody to fall down.
[160:01.10]We need a winner to get played off by.
[160:04.10]We need party chat actors.
[160:05.10]Being in a refugee camp, it's not easy.
[160:07.28]You know, what is next?
[160:09.22]Are you going to leave tomorrow?
[160:10.42]Are you not going to leave tomorrow?
[160:11.98]I missed selfie.
[160:12.64]One day I asked my mom to buy me a computer.
[160:16.47]She saved that money for almost three years.
[160:19.35]It was like that moment that just turned everything.
[160:21.91]No audio for at least 10 seconds.
[160:24.75]73% of the population in South Sudan
[160:27.45]is under the age of 30.
[160:28.21]They are born in war, they were raised up in war, so their mindset and attitude is all about war.
[160:35.32]I decided to teach myself programming so that I can make game for peace.
[160:41.20]I made a game called Salam.
[160:42.82]Salam is an Arabic word that means peace.
[160:45.38]So what you do as a player, you have to stop the bomb from destroying the communities.
[160:50.07]And, you know, people start playing the game in the refugee camp and bringing the people together.
[160:54.35]And I have the passion and the capability to change the world and make a difference.
[161:03.79]Coming up, worlds will change in Fortnite.
[161:07.53]And we present the award for best game direction.
[161:10.45]We're getting close.
[161:11.17]And later, directing duo the Russo Brothers assemble on stage.
[161:15.41]And more music from the Game Awards Orchestra.
[161:17.35]The Russo Brothers?
[161:18.09]That's the Matrix, guys.
[161:18.77]The Game Awards will be right back.
[161:21.36]Right?
[161:21.72]The Wachowskis?
[161:22.86]The Russos?
[161:23.76]Who made the Matrix?
[161:33.19]I'm so sorry.
[161:33.57]That was loud.
[161:34.37]Hey, we played that last night.
[161:36.17]It was a game.
[162:03.84]I will give them this, though.
[162:04.82]Because this used to be on TV, right?
[162:09.90]The Game Awards were on Spike TV, right?
[162:15.39]They've snuck in a lot of ads here.
[162:17.59]Oh, I thought that was for a movie.
[162:26.92]From loud to louder.
[162:34.52]Not actual gameplay.
[162:36.86]I don't understand.
[162:49.22]Oh, it's a PlayStation.
[162:52.09]Oh, this thing sucks, right?
[162:54.61]I've heard nothing but negative responses to PlayStation classes.
[163:00.17]Can't you just press escape with the keyboard plugged in?
[163:02.95]It gets like the debug menu.
[163:09.22]As demonstrated tonight, games require hundreds of elements from music and art to acting, writing, programming, and design.
[163:20.45]Great direction is evident when the work of hundreds somehow combines into a unified creative vision.
[163:27.99]Here are the nominees for Best Game Direction.
[163:31.71]It's gonna be Miyamoto with Mario Odyssey, and he's gonna show up live via satellite.
[163:45.58]I didn't choose to come here.
[163:47.46]Well, Connor was the reason why I came.
[163:56.29]The road ahead is long and unforgiving.
[164:00.65]No place for a boy.
[164:04.71]Spider-Man, I don't know.
[164:09.65]Look, Spider-Man was really good.
[164:13.54]What was it?
[164:14.42]I didn't play God of War.
[164:15.28]I didn't play God of War yet.
[164:16.58]We don't want to kill any of you.
[164:21.18]But we will.
[164:29.89]And the Game Award goes to...
[164:42.45]Tonight, God of War also wins for Best Action Adventure Game.
[164:53.27]God of War?
[164:53.97]Alright.
[164:59.11]Wow.
[165:00.39]Alright.
[165:00.89]I'm ready.
[165:08.80]I'm... Son of a bitch.
[165:12.34]I'm not going to cry tonight.
[165:13.85]Alright.
[165:14.87]First, I want to thank Sony for the support and faith you foolishly placed in me and our great team over at Santa Monica, to my amazing wife,
[165:28.17]Foolishly placed.
[165:29.65]What a fucking fantastic video game director.
[165:32.25]What are you talking about?
[165:33.97]Throughout all of this, to the unbelievable team that I have been blessed with at Santa Monica, every human being who put so much of themselves...
[165:49.80]Please wrap it up.
[165:52.13]Into this game, I am forever thankful for all of you and all the work, for the cast that we were blessed with.
[165:58.45]You guys are amazing.
[165:59.63]You brought it every single day and elevated the work that we wrote on the page beyond what we could have ever imagined it.
[166:05.23]So thank you to David Jaffe, who created all this.
[166:07.66]I wouldn't even be here if he hadn't done that.
[166:13.29]2018 has been an absolutely bananas year for games.
[166:16.92]We are all lucky that every creator out there, every creator in this audience, every creator out there in the world is absolutely crushing it, motivating me and everybody else to work even harder, but it wouldn't even be worth it or even... He said banana.
[166:31.53]We wouldn't be driven without all the fans out there, without all the people who love games, all games, all throughout the industry.
[166:39.53]We have an amazing community, and there is so much more that unites us and divides us.
[166:43.81]So thank you, everybody.
[166:44.62]It's great.
[166:47.88]That's a great game.
[166:49.14]You know what I mean?
[167:07.87]Christmas time.
[167:09.31]Hey, Merry Christmas.
[167:11.07]Is this a Christmas game or what do you think?
[167:46.96]Is this Dreams?
[167:47.78]Is this Dreams?
[167:51.12]Oh, it's fucking Fortnite.
[167:52.34]I thought it was gonna be Dreams.
[167:56.83]Hey look, the Christmas update for Fortnite.
[168:02.37]Season 7, and I was gonna put it on there, and I didn't.
[168:12.67]Fortnite Season 7 launched this morning.
[168:15.20]He's had a busy day, but here he is on the Game Awards stage yet again, Donald Mustard.
[168:19.60]Donald, welcome to the show, and congratulations on such an insane year.
[168:23.82]Oh, thank you.
[168:24.38]It's been an insane and crazy year, and we're just...
[168:28.62]humbled and grateful for all the players everywhere for playing Fortnite and for helping us build the game with them.
[168:35.27]How do I do this?
[168:36.43]I don't even know how to do this.
[168:41.44]I forgot to mention.
[168:42.82]Nobody gives a shit about this on this channel.
[168:45.98]I can guarantee it.
[168:48.58]If... If we get bingo, I'm going to gift community sub a hundred subs.
[168:59.81]Right?
[169:00.53]Yes.
[169:01.61]Fortnite Creative is launching on December 13th, so next week.
[169:06.52]Fortnite Creative is a mode, a brand new mode, where everyone will be given their own private island, where you can design your own games and build
[169:16.11]Whatever you want.
[169:17.05]I'm going to give myself.
[169:18.41]I'm just going to delete money.
[169:19.19]Holy shit.
[169:19.43]He's giving money to himself.
[169:33.36]Except he's just deleting some of it early early Early access is actually available right now So if you want to get into it right the second go pick up a battle pass and you can how do you give it?
[169:43.46]This early access week But I hear there's there's maybe something a little more there is so I don't know how in the few hours that it's been out I've seen just already millions of people building
[169:54.59]Crazy crazy stuff and we suspected that might happen.
[169:57.87]Yes, and the map is kind of crowded and on the island And we figured we needed to clear out a little space.
[170:03.93]Where is it to make room for some stuff?
[170:06.37]So let's head over to the game now See what's happened in the fortnight world.
[170:10.89]That's right Should I turn this off?
[170:28.95]I can't just turn it off.
[170:31.36]Here, just watch this awesome Fortnite Season 7 gameplay.
[170:35.40]Hey, maybe they'll do like a big purple cube again.
[170:37.37]That electric cube cube.
[170:43.79]I can't talk shit about Fortnite because, like, the half of Earth loves this game.
[170:46.77]I would just be solidifying my own destruction.
[170:48.65]Wow.
[170:48.73]Okay.
[170:48.97]How are you going to pick?
[171:06.83]We're going to all pick it together.
[171:07.97]Okay.
[171:08.41]And so there's going to be new stuff coming there all the time, and we think this is going to be an incredible way for us to all continue to build this game together.
[171:15.75]Alright, so the block, if I load a Fortnite right now, I'd see the block?
[171:18.78]Yeah, the Risky Reels is gone.
[171:21.24]Goodbye, Risky Reels.

[175:40.57]Money laundering.
[175:41.79]Money laundering, uh, implies that you make it money from the transaction.
[175:50.62]One of the Smash Brothers.
[175:54.44]That launches in like 40 minutes.
[175:58.08]I'm cleaning my money.
[176:15.91]Less than an hour.
[176:23.05]Hey, thanks for the sub.
[176:41.85]Who's gonna win Game of the Year?
[176:43.95]That's what I wanna know.
[176:50.16]I don't know how close we are.
[176:54.08]It's gonna be Red Dead.
[176:55.64]I would assume, right?
[177:04.02]No one has said the word revolutionary.
[177:06.12]Stay alive and be the one.
[177:08.38]PUBG Mobile.
[177:09.32]Play free now.
[177:12.23]That was a lot of ads.
[177:13.27]PUBG Mobile.
[177:13.95]This is my game.
[177:14.55]The game where you fought bots and lost.
[177:15.97]Game where I fought bots and won.
[177:34.74]But they weren't bots.
[177:35.44]I was already level, like, 15.
[177:36.36]So bots were... They delete bots from the game after you get to, like, level 10 on the internet there.
[177:41.42]So I'm sorry, but what you're saying is inaccurate.
[177:52.16]PUBG Mobile.
[177:53.06]Play free now.
[177:53.92]They're really pushing PUBG, huh?
[177:57.50]Please welcome the directing tour behind Avengers Infinity War.
[178:02.09]Joe and Anthony Russo.
[178:14.57]Hello.
[178:15.45]My brother and I are thrilled to be here tonight to hand out the award for the best ongoing game.
[178:21.11]Somebody was sleeping?
[178:22.05]This award is for those games that continue to get better and better after their initial release.
[178:26.25]How do I rewind?
[178:27.69]With new adventures and experiences for their fans.
[178:29.93]I didn't see anybody sleeping.
[178:31.43]Originally, there were 10 nominees in this category, but then they asked us to present the award, and now...
[178:41.84]That's a huge spoiler I didn't make.
[178:45.96]Okay, he just did that.
[178:46.91]I didn't.
[178:48.17]Everybody, it's gonna be Fortnite.
[178:54.63]It's not Destiny 2.
[178:55.47]It's gonna be Fortnite.
[178:56.43]Watch.
[178:56.67]Yeah.
[178:58.00]So... Check out the middle here.
[179:01.06]That's fine.
[179:02.94]That counts.
[179:10.85]Why the fuck is this on here?
[179:17.21]Did they have to fill out slots or something?
[179:18.85]I don't understand.
[179:19.97]Why is No Man's Sky on here?
[179:24.57]The rest of these make sense.
[179:28.57]Best ongoing game?
[179:32.66]And the game award goes to... Why wouldn't you put, like, Warframe there instead of...
[179:39.41]Fortnite.
[179:40.01]No Man's Sky.
[179:46.12]Fortnite also wins for best multiplayer game.
[179:56.82]Best multiplayer game, Fortnite.
[179:58.86]Best ongoing game, Fortnite.
[180:04.40]The Russo Brothers.
[180:08.89]We love you so much, all of us, right?
[180:12.24]Thank you so much for everything you guys have done for us.
[180:20.10]I represent just the teeniest portion of the team that just works so hard every day to make the game that is Fortnite.
[180:31.63]There's just so many people pouring their souls, their talent, their time into trying every day to bring all the people playing that game.
[180:43.82]Joy and delight.
[180:44.52]What's the mustard for?
[180:45.24]That's it.
[180:45.62]That's all.
[180:46.08]That's our mission.
[180:47.06]How can we just bring joy and delight to people?
[180:50.91]And we're just so grateful.
[180:54.27]We're so grateful for all the people who have come on this journey with us.
[181:00.29]Who've played Fortnite.
[181:01.47]Who continue to play it every day and with us help make the game better.
[181:06.04]This has been an extremely humbling experience.
[181:10.53]year for us at Epic as we really learned and tried to just do something that felt wonderful to us.
[181:21.28]And we're just so glad that there's so many of you that agree with us and that are playing the game with us.
[181:29.06]So I imagine that almost everyone here, the reason why you are in the game industry or why you make games or love games is because it feels like a new medium.
[181:42.06]And it really is.
[181:43.24]Games aren't that old.
[181:44.68]Fortnite mustard.
[181:46.15]I think that's what's so exciting for me every day is that feeling that... Donald Mustard.
[181:52.53]There's something over the horizon.
[181:53.96]That's this guy.
[181:54.76]Right?
[181:55.62]And it feels like we're there again, that we're on the cusp as an industry of new, amazing experiences.
[182:04.02]And I'm just so grateful for all of you.
[182:07.50]We're all kind of one big team, all of us in this industry, really pushing this medium.
[182:13.27]And I'm so grateful for it.
[182:14.83]Thank you guys so much.
[182:21.82]Fist bump.
[182:22.84]Go for a fist bump.
[182:24.62]Damn it.
[182:26.68]There are still lots of amazing moments coming up in the show.
[182:29.78]We've got more performances, and of course, the game of the year announcement.
[182:34.82]Whoa, what's going on?
[182:36.10]Technical difficulties.
[182:37.16]Uh-oh, we've got a secret announcement to make through our snow TV.
[182:43.19]This is Joker.
[182:48.01]I've infiltrated the theater.
[182:49.53]Is this gonna be actors in the game?
[182:51.76]Wait, seriously?
[182:53.36]He went alone to the Game Awards?
[182:56.72]But it's so far away.
[182:58.96]Why is he there?
[182:59.80]There's only one thing the Phantom Thieves of Heart specialize in.
[183:05.22]He's there to steal a treasure.
[183:07.75]Have you already sent a calling card?
[183:10.45]We're not the ones sending a card this time.
[183:12.97]In fact, we've been invited.
[183:15.87]Invited to steal the greatest treasure of all.
[183:24.95]Is this like a- is this a Smash Bros.
[183:26.85]Persona character?
[183:28.46]Is this Smash Bros.
[183:30.48]DLC character announcement?
[183:31.80]It's one of these- it's one of these- it's- Persona!
[183:50.30]I am thou, thou art I. Show the strength of thy will and rage against all challengers!
[184:08.61]What?
[184:32.66]Oh, Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.
[184:36.65]We meet again.
[184:38.19]Quite the surprise.
[184:40.33]Alright, so Super Smash Brothers coming out tonight, but it looks like, I know, great choice of shirt here, Reggie.
[184:47.71]The internet is going crazy.
[184:50.04]The announcement of Joker Persona 5 coming to Smash Brothers.
[184:53.44]Everyone's in this game.
[184:54.60]Everyone's in this game, right?
[184:56.22]So we've said that Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, it is the biggest crossover in video game history.
[185:03.42]Dare I say the biggest crossover in entertainment.
[185:05.53]Joker from Persona 5 is the first DLC character.
[185:07.51]What the fuck?
[185:11.55]And so, yes, you know, the game's about to launch.
[185:17.03]We're super excited.
[185:18.29]We're super excited to get the fans the opportunity to summon a persona into the game.
[185:25.48]Amazing.
[185:26.18]Alright.
[185:26.54]So he said Challenger Pack 1.
[185:29.10]The DLC fighters that will come out?
[185:31.12]Correct.
[185:32.26]So this gives you a flavor of how we're approaching the DLC.
[185:35.78]So the DLC, there's going to be five characters.
[185:39.00]Each character will come with a stage.
[185:41.26]It'll come with a collection of music.
[185:43.37]These are going to be characters that are new to the series, just like Joker from Persona 5, characters that you would not anticipate to be in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
[185:55.99]We're super excited about this.
[185:58.06]The fans can go and they can get the fighter's pass to get all of the five fighters that'll be coming to the series.
[186:04.90]We're tremendously excited.
[186:06.36]Well, I would think you'd be even more excited because tonight Smash is about to launch, right?
[186:11.28]Smash is about to launch.
[186:13.71]Who is the publisher of that game?
[186:18.73]You know you needed to have a really good show for me to be here versus... You've been here every year for us, Reggie.
[186:24.61]...making sure everything's going great for the launch.
[186:27.07]So, yeah, we're super excited.
[186:28.81]Smash is just minutes away, and it's going to be fantastic.
[186:33.23]Alright, well, Reggie, you've been here every year for us for the Game Awards.
[186:35.45]We really appreciate it.
[186:36.46]And before we go, maybe we should head to the stage for the Game Awards Orchestra, a little something for Super Smash Bros.
[186:44.02]Reggie, great to see you.
[186:45.10]Enjoy.
[186:48.14]If you're a Persona fan, that's fucking... Seriously, you could probably shit your pants right now.
[186:57.70]At least they're having fun up on that stage.
[187:12.99]That's all you can tell, it's a good band.
[187:19.93]The band is drunk.
[187:21.45]Alright, where are we at?
[187:27.89]We need... I cannot believe that these have not been set.
[187:35.19]No Miyamoto.
[187:35.77]No, Jet can't get the mic back from Presenter.
[187:41.97]Nobody's at Cutting Edge.
[187:45.39]Nobody's sleeping in the audience.
[187:46.65]Who drops the mic?
[187:48.93]No Banjo-Kazooie game?
[187:50.35]There was a heck of a lot.
[188:05.25]Sleeping has happened.
[188:21.24]When somebody asks, what does the music mean?
[188:23.06]The music is when somebody is on the stage too long accepting an award, they get played off by the music.
[188:29.16]You know what I mean?
[188:30.54]And they keep talking and they get played off.
[188:32.70]Nothing means more to me than this game.
[188:34.63]DLC for Red Dead?
[188:40.21]No.
[188:40.75]I wish things were different.
[188:41.85]PC?
[188:52.11]A PC announcement would be fucking huge.
[188:53.87]PC, right?
[188:54.79]Now PC and not coming out like in a year and a half.
[189:20.57]That'd be a big deal.
[189:24.45]Not even an announcement, it was just an ad.
[189:28.35]We're all getting- We're all getting so hyped up for a fucking ad.
[189:31.49]9 out of 10, amazing.
[189:41.09]For the Nintendo- Oh, 9 out of 10 for Nintendo Switch presents Diablo 3.
[189:59.39]For a second, I thought that said like 33% on Metacritic.
[190:02.74]I was like, oh fuck, really?
[190:04.00]That's terrible.
[190:04.70]Why would you advertise that?
[190:05.94]Like, oh, 33%!
[190:06.36]It's a shitty game.
[190:07.46]Yeah, Diablo 3 has been re-released as much as Skyrim at this point.
[190:26.98]When I heard the first time the jungle in Dolby Atmos, I was, well, that's incredible.
[190:33.97]We're all conditioned to look at it as a 2D image.
[190:36.75]Honestly, though, what's the most likely to happen here?
[190:38.47]Fist bump.
[190:38.69]Revolutionary.
[190:39.25]It's magical.
[190:51.14]We've taken a piss.
[190:52.22]I mean, but that leads us to Miyamoto has not made an appearance.
[190:56.06]Elijah Wood hasn't showed up.
[190:57.73]Geno's not in Smash Bros.
[191:00.35]This is the moneymaker right here, guys.
[191:06.45]From, like, here.
[191:08.01]This is the only way it's possible.
[191:18.06]Just a second.
[191:18.44]I forgot I was on webcam.
[191:22.47]Sleeping habit.
[191:30.53]There's been a ton of hecklers?
[191:31.67]No, but for a real heckle, the person presenting has to respond and be like, alright, alright, alright.
[191:48.61]We already saw this though.
[191:54.36]So is Dead by Daylight trying to do a thing with a... They're trying to get people to dot buy and download this new character?
[192:02.48]So then they can move on from games and make a movie about that character in like a couple of years?
[192:09.40]Or is that an actual horror movie character?
[192:11.01]Alright, it's finally that time.
[192:12.67]Here to present our final award is a member of the team that won Game of the Year in 2016.
[192:16.55]Revolutionary, get the music, and somebody yell at him.
[192:20.30]Here's the vice president of Blizzard Entertainment, Jeff Kaplan.
[192:27.52]It might happen.
[192:28.42]Revolutionary.
[192:33.45]Two years ago, we were honored to be up here to accept the Game of the Year for Overwatch.
[192:38.65]It was so awesome, and it meant so much to our team.
[192:43.84]It's so special right now to be able to share that with another studio.
[192:49.24]Red Dead.
[192:49.84]Here to celebrate all of the nominees for Game of the Year.
[192:53.60]Bring them all on stage.
[192:54.22]The Game Awards Orchestra.
[192:58.27]What?
[192:58.79]Oh.
[192:59.89]Oh, I thought... Okay.
[193:01.13]I thought they were presenting.
[193:10.05]They're going to do a piece from every game, I see.
[193:24.48]The orchestra has been... They've been on screen more than Phil Spencer has.
[193:53.29]Assassin's Creed.
[193:53.85]That came out last year.
[193:57.41]Yeah, I didn't give up this year.
[193:59.04]There's been too many of them.
[194:04.20]Maybe it's God of War.
[194:06.58]God of War has a very large chance to win.
[194:10.14]From my understanding.
[194:12.44]It is a very, very fun game.
[194:13.74]It has a lot of interesting cinematics, a lot of good puzzles, and very good fight sequences.
[194:20.22]Very good combat, from what I can tell.
[194:25.26]But Arthur's gonna bring it.
[194:27.52]Arthur's gonna bring it.
[194:30.48]And then we're gonna get 10 people on screen, we're gonna get a pop figure in the shot, someone's gonna say cutting edge, we're gonna get bingo on this last department.
[194:46.26]They're going to bring up a pup pic here of Arthur or something, right?
[195:01.16]This sounds like it's pre-recorded.
[195:04.08]I don't think it is.
[195:23.87]I don't know how you win.
[195:24.54]It's fucking Return of the King, like I said.
[195:40.35]Oh, but there's also Spider-Man.
[195:41.93]There were some really good games this year.
[195:43.41]I'm actually sitting here thinking about it.
[195:48.63]There were at least two or three that I would absolutely say.
[195:52.97]Like, at least four.
[195:56.17]We didn't get any booze from the audience.
[196:04.29]No soda or candy sponsorships.
[196:07.51]No new Banjo-Kazooie game.
[196:17.07]Alright, let's see it.
[196:19.53]Game of the year.
[196:28.40]Alright.
[196:31.16]God dammit, Arthur!
[196:32.16]And the game award for game of the year goes to:
[196:37.82]Red Deaaaaaa-
[196:37.83]God of War.
[196:41.83]Fuck this. Fuck this ceremony. Fuck this award show.
[197:17.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, that's like 15 people.
[197:29.40]And they're all drunk.
[197:30.52]At least one of them is drunk.
[197:35.26]Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
[197:37.94]Somebody fist bump.
[197:40.24]Somebody did a fist bump over there.
[197:41.46]Thank you and thanks so much to the team back in Santa Monica.
[197:45.80]Just an amazing, amazing group of talent that really pulled together to realize this beautiful vision that Corey brought to the franchise reboot for God of War.
[197:59.73]I'm so thankful that Corey returned back to the studio and joined our family once again.
[198:04.94]Did somebody trip?
[198:06.76]You are an amazing visionary.
[198:08.68]Love your partnership.
[198:10.24]Yumi Yang.
[198:18.13]It's really hard to see the behind the scenes work that goes into producing a game like God of War.
[198:24.24]And the triumph that it is about Yumi's steadfast ability to thread that very tricky production needle in the balance with Corey's and the team's creative vision, we would not be where we are on this stage today.
[198:38.30]So thank you to Yumi and the entire production team.
[198:49.68]And you guys, the fans around the world, together, we all dream big dreams.
[198:55.14]And that's an amazing feeling every day when we walk into the studio to create something like God of War.
[199:03.19]I want to thank my children for being the very best and all of the families throughout the God of War team who rode this wave with us.
[199:10.17]Thank you so much for the support that we were given over the course of many, many months, many hours, many years.
[199:18.37]And lastly, Scott Rohde, tremendous support to the Santa Monica studio, Shuhei Yoshida, and Shawn Layden.
[199:31.44]really stood behind us for a studio reboot and a re-envisioning of this franchise, which takes a lot of guts at that level.
[199:40.44]And the entire PlayStation family who stood behind us in that partnership over many years to really realize what this franchise was capable of.
[199:48.38]Thank you, everyone.
[199:49.30]Corey?
[199:51.09]just pull it out of your pocket and just go like, this guy right here.
[199:54.23]I'll be quick because they're flashing, so please wrap it up, but I just want to say every single game that was nominated up here is an absolute masterpiece, so please give it up for all of them.
[200:05.00]Say revolutionary.
[200:06.08]Say revolutionary.
[200:06.62]Say it.
[200:06.88]No, revolutionary.
[200:07.84]It's revolutionary shit.
[200:08.94]That's the music playing them off.
[200:32.21]Jeff, this is your last opportunity.
[200:34.87]You've got to say it.
[200:38.31]Congratulations to the God of War team for winning Game of the Year.
[200:41.06]Let's check the Twitch leaderboard and see who was the most successful, predicting all the winners tonight.
[200:46.26]Amazing.
[200:46.76]Well, it's been a great year for games, as everyone has said.
[200:49.50]Thank you so much for watching the Game Awards.
[200:51.48]We'll see you next year for the Game Awards 2019.
[200:53.37]Good night.
[200:54.05]I really appreciate it.
[200:56.03]No, no, no, no.
[200:57.27]You need to say revolutionary.
[201:10.03]No, you didn't, they didn't say revolutionary.
[201:11.35]Oh my god.
[201:16.58]R.V.M.
[201:22.80]has given up.
[201:23.34]20 community subs.
[201:24.48]I gave 100 earlier.
[201:25.20]20 here.
[201:25.40]Thank you so much, R.V.M.
[201:26.82]20 fucking subs.
[201:27.28]Thank you.
[201:43.94]They said it in the beginning with Reggie?
[201:47.06]Are you sure?
[201:47.58]Do you have a link?
[201:54.56]Are you sure?
[201:55.22]Wait, I gotta rewind.
[202:01.26]Hold on, I gotta- we gotta watch that.
[202:02.49]Hold on.

[202:08.69]We need to see if they said it.
[202:10.97]Holy shit, SovietWinter giving out five community subs.
[202:24.51]No fist fight.
[202:33.77]Claim, claim, claim, claim, claim, claim.
[202:36.79]What are you guys claiming?
[202:37.69]What are you doing?
[202:41.93]Claim?
[202:42.99]What is claim?
[202:49.67]Bedbraham giving out 10 community subs.
[202:52.71]Thank you so much.

[202:56.64]Oh, well, okay.
[202:58.36]Thank you, Bebrahim, for 10 community subs.
[203:02.66]Let me see if we got Bingo, because when they were on stage, we'll see.
[203:11.38]I need to get into here.
[203:14.46]Where is it?
[203:17.10]Right there.
[203:19.78]Alright.
[203:21.56]We need to go open up the video.
[203:32.53]Lightning Rider, five community subs.

[203:41.11]Alright, I need to... For those of you that didn't know, here's like the, what we were doing.
[203:50.86]There.
[203:51.46]Just, people were saying I can't see behind the, uh, the dots, so.
[203:54.54]We need to find out if we actually had bingo, though.
[204:01.66]Let me get that going real quick.
[204:04.56]If I even can.
[204:09.55]I can't interact with this anymore.
[204:13.53]My feed died.
[204:14.63]Okay, hold on.
[204:19.40]Let's go over here.
[204:26.58]So, you guys saying that they said revolutionary or revolutionize.
[204:30.74]I would take that.
[204:31.24]If you were on Jeopardy, that counts too.
[204:41.65]Did anybody remember where that was?
[204:42.77]Videos.
[204:47.81]Okay, hold on.
[204:53.93]It was like in the beginning, right?
[205:05.71]Here we go, okay, alright, here they are, here they are.
[205:13.26]Welcoming from Nintendo, Reggie Fils-Aimé.
[205:17.42]From PlayStation, Shawn Layden.
[205:20.00]And from Xbox, Phil Spencer.
[205:23.26]No, wrong.
[205:37.30]Okay, here we go.
[205:37.98]Tonight at the Game Awards, we come together as a community to celebrate video games, the most compelling and immersive form of entertainment in the world.
[205:47.11]As an industry, we are most powerful when we come together, united by our common love for the art form of games.
[205:59.00]Right?
[206:00.34]But when do you say it?
[206:02.22]We join with the viewers and gamers around the globe to celebrate creativity, innovation, and the role that video games play in popular culture.
[206:11.16]Just saying every word besides revolutionary.
[206:14.20]Together, we will continue to invite new voices, creators, and players into our worlds.
[206:22.31]Because when everybody plays, we all win.
[206:26.92]Because when we see the strength of a united gaming community, we remember that we've never seen a challenge that you can't defeat.
[206:38.01]I knew they didn't say it.
[206:41.57]We're united in our commitment to leading and pushing this industry forward with new games, new experiences, and new ways for everyone to play.
[206:54.72]Good luck to all the nominees.
[206:57.46]And congratulations to all the winners.
[207:00.10]And enjoy the game awards.
[207:02.42]Jeff, take it away.
[207:04.51]Thank you so much, guys.
[207:06.67]Liars.
[207:08.21]We didn't get bingo.
[207:09.17]Sorry.
[207:16.04]Let's fill in even the ones that may not have even happened, right?
[207:22.03]So we didn't get cutting edge.
[207:25.49]No pop figurine.
[207:26.73]Give me a break.
[207:27.61]That was so easy too.
[207:31.85]Take the hundred subs back.
[207:38.78]Audience boos.
[207:41.00]Nobody, no, we didn't get like a real good boo.
[207:45.60]Group presentation, that barely happened.
[207:53.37]Oh, you guys are booing now.
[207:57.91]You gotta use the free Red Dead one on the left, but where does, okay, but what, that was like up here.
[208:03.55]I can't just put it over disgruntled nominee tweets within 10 minutes of their loss.
[208:17.61]Well, we got bingo then.
[208:20.53]Quick search Twitter.
[208:23.24]He doesn't, no, Jonah Hill does not count as Elijah Wood.
[208:29.77]Oh, we got five, four different bingos.
[208:36.58]Mobile game, but we didn't get a new Call of Duty announcement or a Diablo 4 teaser.
[208:51.47]Oh my fucking god.
[208:52.67]R.V.E.M.
[208:55.47]is another 20 community subs from R.V.E.M.
[209:00.57]Dude, uh, you're like matching nearly, what, 40?
[209:07.81]Holy shit, dude.
[209:08.72]Thank you so much.
[209:09.52]I mean, I was just, I just gave money to myself.
[209:13.50]But you gave money to me.
[209:15.18]So, thank you so fucking much, dude.
[209:16.78]Jesus Christ.
[209:19.97]Very generous of you.
[209:20.93]For real.
[209:21.35]I'm looking you right in the eye, too.
[209:23.27]Look at you right in the fucking eye.
[209:26.43]Well, it wasn't by accident.
[209:27.75]Like, I bought it.
[209:28.79]I was going to do it.
[209:30.37]I was going to do it regardless.
[209:31.59]Even if we didn't get bingo, I was going to do it.
[209:34.29]I was going to be like, who cares?
[209:35.27]Like, boom, right?
[209:36.91]But I didn't know that, like, completing, like, actually purchasing them is, like, then they go out.
[209:42.64]I thought, like, I had maybe I could give them out.
[209:50.38]So.
[209:53.44]And like, what the fuck?
[209:54.86]Guy buys 100 subs?
[209:57.24]And like, accidentally?
[209:59.79]What the heck?
[210:11.56]Just cancel your credit card.
[210:14.27]No.
[210:15.41]I'm glad.
[210:16.81]Get off of me.
[210:17.63]Fucking Red Dead didn't win.
[210:19.87]I'm glad.
[210:21.29]Whatever.
[210:21.63]It's good.
[210:22.83]Needs Vaseline.
[210:24.05]10 community subs.
[210:24.77]Thank you.
[210:30.31]Thank you so much for your 10 community subs.
[210:34.59]And that's it.
[210:35.31]That's it, man.
[210:36.39]That's the end of the game awards.
[210:39.20]Big night for holy fuck.
[210:40.48]That's 10 more from Pinman.
[210:46.04]I need to play God of War.
[210:47.22]I think that's... I gotta play God of War now.
[210:50.42]I have to just play it.
[210:51.18]I'll probably stream it.
[210:52.98]Oh my fucking god.
[210:54.18]What is happening in this chatroom?
[210:55.70]That's 10 subs from Kairotobi.
[210:59.54]10 from Pinman.
[211:00.24]10 from Kairotobi.
[211:06.36]Holy shit.
[211:11.77]You guys are fucking awesome.
[211:15.47]Play Fortnite.
[211:18.23]No, but that's gonna be my time.
[211:20.24]That's all I really wanted to do tonight.
[211:23.04]I will see you guys, but first of all... Holy shit, there's so many fucking subs on this list.
[211:29.12]Are you kidding me?
[211:30.80]This is an insane amount of subscriptions.
[211:36.43]My god.
[211:40.73]Well, let's go back in time here.
[211:49.70]Jesus Christ.
[211:51.02]That's a lot of fucking subs.
[211:53.38]Commander Pepper with five community subs.
[211:58.02]I didn't have notifications on tonight, but I do want to at least touch on a few that came in.
[212:06.42]It was $50 that came in.
[212:11.33]Let me go back here.
[212:17.25]Thanks for the sub.
[212:17.87]Hey, thanks for being here, man.
[212:20.55]I did see 50 bucks came in.
[212:21.97]I want to make sure I figure this out because I kind of lost it somehow.
[212:36.22]I only read $50 bit messages.
[212:39.30]That's not true.
[212:44.08]I want to make sure I can at least go back far enough.
[212:45.54]There we go.
[212:50.17]Okay.
[212:52.73]Don't read this.
[212:53.99]Well, I just did.
[212:57.33]Is there any reason why this is only pulling from like 40 minutes ago?
[213:05.04]Don't ask me why.
[213:09.98]But, uh, yeah, I'm gonna end the stream here.
[213:12.42]Let's be right back.
[213:13.44]Let's get the outro on, just so you know.
[213:15.50]I'll see you guys again on Saturday.
[213:17.46]Probably for Dreamcast.
[213:19.96]I'm looking to try to get some of that going.
[213:21.64]Should be a lot of fun.
[213:24.85]Thank you for watching the Game Awards.
[213:28.19]It was pretty interesting.
[213:30.17]Too bad we didn't get, uh, bingo.
[213:33.51]Kind of annoying.
[213:35.75]But have a great rest of your night.
[213:39.74]And I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[213:42.81]So, you're either going to see Smash Bros.
[213:44.55]or Dreamcast on Saturday and Sunday.
[213:46.83]Depends on how much I want to play it and unlock stuff and do things, you know?
[213:57.04]But, for the purposes of... I don't know why Streamlabs does this for some reason.
[214:06.11]If there's too many notifications, it just deletes all of them that were at the bottom.
[214:11.12]Why?
[214:11.34]I don't understand.
[214:14.10]Isn't the whole purpose of this thing to keep track of bits and subs?
[214:23.35]I don't understand.
[214:26.11]But if you've taken off, have a good rest of your night.
[214:29.67]Uh, what's the jermaMustard site?
[214:38.38]That's a very useful website.
[214:48.48]There it is.
[214:48.98]Alright.
[214:57.25]So, this is from... Yeah, that's a good time frame.
[215:07.92]So we had... There we go.
[215:10.77]Excellent.
[215:11.15]Okay.
[215:14.27]So, thank you to... Uh, we're gonna go back to front here.
[215:19.69]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $1.
[215:21.48]Haha, first bits I win.
[215:24.50]It's not a contest, man.
[215:26.40]BakeMeHome, thanks for $2 here.
[215:27.96]I heard somebody equally as compact as you is hosting the Oscars this year.
[215:32.26]I don't know who's hosting the Oscars, but... I don't know what that means.
[215:37.47]But thanks.
[215:40.41]Divas.
[215:40.79]Thank you, Divas, for the $3.
[215:42.63]No message.
[215:43.15]Just $3.
[215:44.07]Pretty much every single damn stream, man.
[215:45.69]Thank you.
[215:49.66]Mr. Cloud.
[215:50.58]Mr. Cloud, thanks for the $10.
[215:51.54]No message.
[215:52.54]Thank you for $10, Mr. Cloud.
[215:55.50]Adala from IamMonk.
[215:56.80]You're my game of the year.
[215:58.30]Hey, thanks.
[216:00.30]Thank you.
[216:04.14]Really appreciate that.
[216:06.58]Extra cheesy again.
[216:07.40]Thanks for $1, dude.
[216:08.30]I can't believe they're announcing No Man's Sky this year.
[216:10.28]It's gonna be epic.
[216:14.32]No Man's Sky really- that just felt really out of place.
[216:19.31]I can't- I can't give a reason why that was there.
[216:21.03]It was weird.
[216:25.31]But thank you, Mostly Lost, for the $1.
[216:28.05]There were two bald guys on stage in the orchestra.
[216:30.63]Oh, we got them.
[216:34.30]They've done a lot to make that game better.
[216:38.26]But is it better than Warframe?
[216:42.80]You know what I mean?
[216:51.43]A lot.
[216:52.27]A lot, but not enough.
[216:56.99]I see.
[216:59.74]But thank you, uh, MostlyLost for the $1.
[217:01.74]Thank you, WildFox for the $1.
[217:03.18]Hey, Jerm, it's 3am while I'm writing this and I decided to stay and watch because I had way too much caffeine today.
[217:07.79]I've touched on this subject before, but I found that keeping myself busy with something, whether it be games or crafting, helps a lot to keep my mental health up.
[217:15.05]What are some of the things you do to deal with bad times?
[217:19.94]Um, mostly, I would say, is kind of just
[217:28.46]When you're lying down in bed, anytime I lie down in bed, decompressing, I think, your thoughts, whether you're in the shower or, honest to God, I'm gonna be real with you here, when you're taking a shit, is just like, I get a lot of, I improve my mental health by taking a shit, taking a shower, or lying in bed and compressing thoughts.
[217:57.97]That might be... you might give me some disgusted faces here, but... A lot of... a lot of my growth has come from when I was sitting on the toilet.
[218:10.39]All at the same time.
[218:16.21]Weird flex, but okay.
[218:23.33]But yeah, that's really when you can, I don't know, alone time for me.
[218:27.27]Especially when you kind of just, you and only you.
[218:33.21]You can really do a lot of good for yourself.
[218:35.99]Shower and on the toilet, for real.
[218:46.31]But, uh, thank you, WildFox.
[218:51.46]I'm sorry that you stayed up this late.
[218:57.17]But thank you.
[218:59.31]Uh, Paza Jan, thanks for the $1.
[219:01.49]I genuinely clicked off my porn to watch your stream.
[219:05.93]Uh, thanks, I guess.
[219:11.67]I guess that's a, uh, welcome, thank you.
[219:14.08]Okay.
[219:16.40]Uh, Ass Burns, Assa Burns, thanks for the $2 here.
[219:20.54]Or $3, actually, thank you, Assa Burns.
[219:24.41]If I dye my hair green, it's all falling out.
[219:25.69]You understand, guys?
[219:52.39]Uh, Luxur- Luxurian Hat.
[219:54.52]Thanks for the $20.
[219:55.04]They say cutting edge.
[219:59.02]Are you at the Game Awards and did you present?
[220:01.26]Because then we get to put the blue circle over the marker there.
[220:07.99]Thank you for the $20.
[220:08.77]20 bucks.
[220:15.46]Hey, Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[220:17.10]Fallout New Vegas just got a massive story overhaul mod called Fallout New California.
[220:22.22]It's basically a brand new game with a brand new story.
[220:25.00]And the quality is breathtaking, and it'd be awesome if you took a look at it and gave the creators a well-deserved plug.
[220:31.37]New California.
[220:36.07]Interesting.
[220:38.61]I've never heard of it until now, but... Modders are... a dedicated bunch.
[220:48.80]Takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to put something like that together, so, applaud.
[220:52.65]Applause to that.
[220:57.09]Nice try, Todd.
[221:01.49]Thank you, Uigi, for the $10 here.
[221:04.53]Ring your mom and thank her right now.
[221:06.55]I'm not on the stage doing awards.
[221:12.80]But thank you.
[221:14.80]Hey, Golden Cricket, thanks for this, the $50 here from Golden Cricket.
[221:19.94]50 bucks.
[221:21.52]I'm glad you made a decision to cast this, Jerma.
[221:24.12]I sincerely hope you make this on this stage or another one of these days.
[221:30.15]I don't know what the hell I would even do, man.
[221:31.93]I'm not gonna get invited to the game awards.
[221:35.57]I don't think that'll ever happen.
[221:44.24]Come out dressed as a clown?
[221:46.70]They wouldn't ever invite me back.
[221:50.54]I already was there.
[221:51.26]I was the Muppet.
[221:55.60]Best joke.
[221:57.32]They don't tend to invite small streamers.
[222:02.48]See, that's a double joke right there.
[222:04.63]I'll give that to you.
[222:06.49]But thank you for the $50, Golden Cricket.
[222:12.27]It's a lot of money.
[222:13.09]Thank you.
[222:16.55]Thank you, TheSwissGiant, for the $15...
[222:21.06]No message, just Kappas.
[222:23.56]Thank you.
[222:25.28]Timmy Tim-Tam, thanks for the $1.
[222:26.42]When you play World of Light, go left.
[222:30.90]That's a spoiler.
[222:31.62]I don't want to read a spoiler.
[222:34.72]Captain Jake, 1998, thanks for the $1.
[222:36.26]Hey, it's my favorite compact streamer.
[222:38.16]How does it dangle?
[222:40.69]Dangles, well, it's going well.
[222:42.37]Thank you Dubski dude for the $1.
[222:43.85]I feel like such a boomer because I think you were literally the only redeeming thing out of this whole thing.
[222:48.51]That furry on stage was just having a good time.
[222:52.84]You know what I mean?
[222:56.72]Just trying to have a good time.
[222:57.80]Just trying to relax a little.
[222:59.08]You know what I mean?
[223:00.00]Don't worry about it.
[223:03.76]Thank you Dubski dude though.
[223:06.08]Uh, Acid Burns again, thanks for one dollar.
[223:08.46]No message, just four or five dollars here in a row.
[223:12.86]Uh, Flying Muffin Bunnies, thanks for the one dollar.
[223:15.24]They say the dot.
[223:23.35]The dot, with a pug.
[223:28.91]There's Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[223:30.65]Thanks, Garfield.
[223:32.19]Breaking news.
[223:32.95]Read all about it.
[223:33.55]Spider-Man got snubbed for Best Game Award.
[223:36.11]They just couldn't handle all those Mary and Miles stealth missions, I suppose.
[223:40.29]That's a real shame.
[223:41.29]Spidey has been getting a real raw deal this year.
[223:44.24]Especially sad since Andrew Garfield played Spider-Man, so Garfield's a connection to Spider-Verse.
[223:49.68]Even if... Oh, my fucking God.
[224:02.44]That's true.
[224:03.38]That, like, that is so painfully true.
[224:05.86]Andrew Garfield played Spider-Man, so I feel a connection to him.
[224:10.65]Also, where's Earthworm Jim in Smash?
[224:14.06]I know, I know.
[224:19.09]Thank you, Garfield.
[224:21.01]Thank you, Blue Comet, for the $1.
[224:24.35]Thank you, Tetra Regaton, for the $12.22.
[224:29.24]They say, do not do something under any circumstances here, and I'm not going to do it.
[224:34.76]And then Dedo Dedo, at the end, gave $10.
[224:39.94]Play Fortnite or lose Best Streamer.
[224:41.80]I already lost.
[224:42.36]I didn't win, guys.
[224:44.67]Come on.
[224:46.79]Wasn't even close.
[224:48.91]A few more at the end.
[224:49.77]Carrot.
[224:50.23]Thanks for the $1, Carrot.
[224:51.57]Hey, Jerm, I'm turning 18 in about a minute.
[224:53.83]So I thought I'd celebrate by helping you pay back those 100 community subs.
[224:57.47]These past four months of being subscribed to you have been a blast.
[224:59.75]Crazy to think I've been watching you since the TF2 days.
[225:02.88]Thank you, Carrot.
[225:03.98]Happy birthday.
[225:05.66]And... Nah, I was just... I was planning on doing it anyways.
[225:10.94]I was like, oh, if we could bingo!
[225:13.04]I actually was talking about that last night.
[225:17.10]to uh Etalyx I was like I'm gonna get like 100 community subs if we get bingo and then I forgot about it until like two and a half hours into the stream and then I bought them and then I I I was under the assumption that I could but you saw what happened I just completed the purchase and 100 community subs went through that's what happened I'd never done it before
[225:45.46]Do a hundred more.
[225:46.48]No.
[225:54.17]Somebody was like, even if you fucked it up, it doesn't mean it's not illegal.
[225:57.45]I don't think it's illegal.
[226:03.45]I just gave Twitch money.
[226:09.17]And a hundred people can now use emotes in the channel.
[226:20.44]scheme I'm pyramid scheming myself but thank you to uh 420 squid for the five dollars clueless sniper for one dollar zaza's alt for the one dollar remember back when you were a top 1000 streamer never expected you'd make it all the way to number one can't wait to read about you getting arrested in five years after waiting wasting all your money on slots and cocaine
[226:49.55]Thanks, KyroToby, for the $1.
[226:50.94]Hey, Jerma, the... ToughWrench asks if I'm going to play Metal Gear Solid V. I don't think I'm going to play Metal Gear Solid V on stream.
[227:05.55]I did it a long time ago.
[227:06.61]I already played it.
[227:08.75]I already got enjoyment out of it.
[227:10.21]I'm not sure I would stream it.
[227:13.81]But thank you, though.
[227:14.83]And thank you to StyxRenegade for the one dollar.
[227:17.65]No one you have, uh, colitis and IBD ever have an abscess.
[227:22.75]I just had my second one, I almost forgot how painful it was.
[227:25.74]Hopefully I can reach him remission again soon, at least the pain is gone.
[227:29.80]Um, I don't- no, I've never had an abscess before.
[227:33.50]I've had something called a fissure before, which sucks.
[227:37.46]But... not that.
[227:40.90]Thankfully I've been pretty much okay recently.
[227:43.14]Like, completely.
[227:46.46]But I'm really sorry to hear that.
[227:49.62]Two.
[227:51.07]That's not good.
[227:53.03]That sucks.
[227:55.81]Hopefully you do get into remission soon.
[227:59.77]Fishes suck also.
[228:01.13]Oh yeah, they do.
[228:02.25]It's not good.
[228:06.58]But thank you, sticks.
[228:09.56]Hopefully you get better real soon.
[228:15.51]Extra cheesy for the $1.
[228:16.65]Thank you.
[228:16.99]They say Johnny Bravo will be the next character in Smash.
[228:19.63]I'm from the future.
[228:23.65]Modus Ponus.
[228:25.17]Thanks for the $1.
[228:26.09]And then Raving Happy.
[228:27.18]Thanks for $2.
[228:28.30]No messages on those last two.
[228:32.28]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[228:34.04]I'll see you on Saturday.
[228:35.88]We'll do something fun.
[228:42.29]Oops.
[228:43.39]What a fucking mess.
[228:45.42]Let's roll the credits.
[228:46.18]There's gonna be so many subs.
[228:49.02]There's gonna be a lot.
[228:50.96]Just fair warning here.
[228:55.31]Here they come.
[228:57.95]Oh my god.
[229:03.85]Yeah, sleep tight, guys.
[229:04.69]I'll see you on Saturday.
[229:06.75]Thanks for sticking around.
[229:10.20]Read them?
[229:10.70]I can't read these.
[229:12.68]No, I will never be able to read these.
[229:23.54]Oh, tonight was rigged.
[229:24.72]I don't think so.
[229:26.84]I think God of War probably deserves it.
[229:29.26]I was just kidding.
[229:29.76]I was fucking around.
[229:32.12]When, uh... I was doing the whole, um... Fallout 76 can't win 2018 game of the year.
[229:38.46]Yeah, because... No, yeah, you're right.
[229:42.17]It can't.
[229:50.87]I wanted to be mad...
[229:57.18]Thought Fortnite was gonna win.
[229:58.28]I really am just stupid and I just put Fortnite in a giant circle in the middle.
[230:02.20]Didn't even help either.
[230:12.15]Connor got robbed.
[230:12.97]It would have been nice to see Connor win.
[230:16.01]But... There was some really good competition up there.
[230:20.18]There was some very, very good competition.
[230:37.97]Why was Connor not in the Rumble?
[230:40.77]Oh, I actually was gonna make him and Hank as a tag team.
[230:44.84]But I ran out of time.
[230:52.62]Do it.
[230:54.52]Yeah, I just, I ran out of time.
[230:56.00]It wasn't enough.
[230:57.94]I crunched it to the very last minute on that stream, so...
[231:07.92]You didn't make Connor, but you put in the Quiet Man.
[231:12.26]Yeah, but the Quiet Man was... so relevant at that particular second, you know?
[231:20.24]He was very, very relevant.
[231:28.13]So again, I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[231:30.91]We will hopefully be doing...
[231:36.11]I don't know.
[231:36.63]I really don't know.
[231:37.11]It really depends on how much fun Smash really is.
[231:43.36]If Smash is... Alright, whatever.
[231:45.46]I'm just playing it.
[231:46.18]SpongeBob Movie 2004.
[231:50.93]Ashen's is up.
[231:52.17]Did that just come out today?
[231:53.79]How have I not heard about that yet?
[231:56.51]I was looking forward to that game.
[231:57.73]How long has that been out for?
[232:11.32]Interesting.
[232:11.83]Okay, well, I'll get to check that out too.
[232:17.91]But yeah, that's it, guys.
[232:20.33]Have a great rest of your night.
[232:22.77]Thank you for watching the Game Awards with me.
[232:27.86]See you soon.
[232:29.00]Take care, guys.
