[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.03]Alright.
[00:07.31]So, I think it's going.
[00:10.79]Hopefully, there's no problems with the actual stream because that would not be cool.
[00:14.97]twitch.tv.
[00:19.25]I got to change this.
[00:24.35]I got to change this.
[00:29.01]It says I'm going to be playing CSGO, but that's not the case.
[00:32.16]That's got to be changed.
[00:42.64]Okay.
[00:44.76]Yeah, the chat is lagging.
[00:46.22]I can't see any of these... The chat is all screwed up.
[00:51.16]That is not cool.
[00:55.13]So let me...
[01:00.29]I don't have a solution to that, so I'm just going to have to do it, play it by ear, and if something happens, something happens, you know?
[01:05.19]Oh yeah, I tried to see how to spell principal right.
[01:12.24]If you saw that in the Google chat.
[01:15.06]How do you spell principal?
[01:16.14]I don't know.
[01:16.52]Let's see if I can pop this out.
[01:25.52]Alright.
[01:29.14]This is muted.
[01:33.90]Lower.
[01:35.18]Just want to chat.
[01:39.62]Mmm, that's not working for me.
[01:43.12]That is not working for me.
[01:48.38]Come on, Twitch, get your act together.
[01:52.23]That won't pop it up.
[01:54.93]I'm refreshing the page.
[01:56.95]If you have any chat problems, just try refreshing.
[01:59.25]Maybe that'll help.
[02:00.83]If not, then I'm not exactly sure what to do.
[02:04.28]But it's okay.
[02:06.29]We shall persevere.
[02:16.28]That's right there.
[02:17.60]Okay.
[02:18.64]Just going to tell people what's happening on the various social media networks.
[02:27.47]It's going on Twitter.
[02:29.39]And then, of course, the Steam group.
[02:34.21]Steam community groups.
[02:39.63]The inhumane psychopaths.
[02:42.63]Let's get you on the meds.
[02:46.08]Party.
[02:58.68]twitch.tv.
[03:01.24]Oh, by the way, I'm also sorry for starting this
[03:03.74]pretty late.
[03:05.92]I was trying to get that video up and it was not working.
[03:14.68]Don't know why, but it just wasn't.
[03:19.78]Not in all caps, that's me screaming.
[03:23.32]Woohoo!
[03:26.25]15 minutes.
[03:29.69]And that's that.
[03:34.50]And one more.
[03:35.48]Gotta tell all the people on the YouTubes about it.
[03:46.79]Channel.
[03:50.18]Feed.
[03:50.82]Streaming TF2 and Flash games.
[03:59.81]http://www.witch.TV.
[04:04.05]Alright.
[04:14.79]Okay.
[04:17.09]Good afternoon, morning, evening, night time, whatever it happens to be in your quarters of the world.
[04:25.15]Welcome to the stream of Flash Gordon Games.
[04:34.27]So, sooner or later here, when I get my server up and running, we're not going to have to do this anymore.
[04:38.87]It'll just be, hey, I'm in my server.
[04:41.29]Everyone go there if you want to play.
[04:43.50]Because now it's kind of like, where are we going to find a good map to play on?
[04:49.40]How about the Gold Rush?
[04:52.16]Alright, Gold Rush it is.
[04:55.42]Oh, no, wait, never mind.
[04:57.78]Refresh.
[04:59.12]It was like 15 people already in there.
[05:07.52]How about this player's server not full.
[05:13.12]That's fine.
[05:13.96]Alright, come on.
[05:17.24]Stop with the refresh.
[05:18.92]Oh, come on.
[05:20.60]I just refreshed it again trying to hit stop refresh.
[05:23.70]Valve, why do you do that?
[05:26.38]Stop.
[05:26.90]Okay.
[05:29.93]How about... Let's find a good one.
[05:32.85]Ooh, that one is Thunder Mountain.
[05:35.27]Caught Badlands.
[05:36.23]Kick the hell, Badlands.
[05:38.33]Here's the IP.
[05:40.13]Let's get started.
[05:43.17]And boom, heads in there.
[05:46.97]All hands on deck.
[05:52.48]King of the Hill Nucleus should be a rock in time.
[05:59.76]It's 4.05 in California, yeah?
[06:03.44]Yeah, I'm sorry for starting late.
[06:04.46]I said this before, but I'll say it again.
[06:06.36]It's probably like 7 in the morning, or like 5 in the morning for people that are used to seeing this at least at a reasonable time, and I apologize for that.
[06:16.16]I usually want to start at around 5.36, but 7, 7.30 is when we're actually starting, and I feel bad for you European guys.
[06:25.82]That's my fault, and I do apologize.
[06:29.40]What do I want to do now?
[06:30.36]Let's go, soldier.
[06:34.52]Make sure the audio is good.
[06:38.76]How's the in-game audio?
[06:40.44]Should it be lower, higher?
[06:42.06]How's it sound?
[06:44.14]What am I bumping into?
[06:44.66]You know, I'll stick with the direct hit.
[06:54.69]The chat's still broken.
[06:56.13]Yeah, I don't know.
[06:57.83]If you can not see the chat, I apologize.
[07:01.76]There's nothing I can do.
[07:04.80]Oh, come on, you scout.
[07:06.66]Why am I using the half Satoshi, by the way?
[07:12.52]Come here!
[07:14.66]Oh!
[07:15.34]Which way are you going to go?
[07:16.77]What?
[07:17.21]What was that?
[07:17.75]Oh, it was a crit.
[07:19.17]Oh, okay.
[07:20.89]Yeah, the chat's not refreshing for me either.
[07:23.29]So I guess just sit back and relax, and if you're playing, play, I guess.
[07:29.44]Five, four, three, oh, I'm taking the direct hit off.
[07:33.52]Get rid of this thing.
[07:34.14]Why am I using the Gunboats?
[07:36.74]What on Earth are these on here for right now?
[07:40.51]I'll keep the half-satoichi on.
[07:43.23]I'm not very good with the, uh, the direct hit.
[07:47.25]It's hard.
[07:47.67]It's very hard to use.
[07:49.41]I'm going this way.
[07:55.80]Now, you know what?
[07:59.48]Where'd he go?
[07:59.80]Where'd he go?
[08:00.08]Where'd he go?
[08:01.48]I'm gonna jump around.
[08:07.80]What's going on here?
[08:09.94]Super lag.
[08:12.34]Super lag!
[08:15.18]Oh no, get rid of that!
[08:18.80]Central down!
[08:22.48]I need health.
[08:24.83]Unloaded all my shots on this shotgun.
[08:26.51]I don't know how that happened.
[08:30.75]Oh my god!
[08:32.07]Hold on, something has to change.
[08:38.64]That's why.
[08:40.66]Sensitivity was all a little low.
[08:44.00]Gonna have to deal with it though.
[08:47.92]So when are we gonna get an update?
[08:49.63]When's like the Team Fortress update coming out?
[08:55.05]How am I not hitting him?
[08:55.81]I feel like I'm lagging like crazy.
[09:00.41]I'm starting to go on a roll here.
[09:04.88]Ding ding!
[09:07.89]Oh, here comes Burgah Boy.
[09:08.83]I wonder who that is.
[09:09.59]That can't be Burgah Boy right there, can it?
[09:17.11]Burgah Boy.
[09:19.79]Hold that point.
[09:29.22]I wish I could see the chat.
[09:30.54]I'm refreshing.
[09:31.52]This is stupid.
[09:33.82]I can't see the chat.
[09:35.69]Maybe if I do this, I might be able to see the chat if I go to the dashboard.
[09:39.01]Maybe just the actual chat is screwed up.
[09:40.53]Maybe not.
[09:46.64]Maybe not.
[09:48.92]Twitch, what the heck?
[09:52.18]No, I'm streaming on Twitch because YouTube is usually broken.
[09:58.51]And I guess not.
[10:01.19]I guess not, Twitch.
[10:06.33]Bing, bing, bing.
[10:11.50]Oh, I'm gonna get headshot.
[10:12.32]I know it.
[10:12.82]I know it.
[10:14.10]Run away.
[10:18.32]Alright.
[10:21.92]Uh, this guy's screwed.
[10:27.15]Get rid of that medic.
[10:30.45]I thought... Oh, I thought I killed him.
[10:32.99]You see that in the kill feed?
[10:33.89]It was like, oh, nope.
[10:35.37]You killed the guy behind him.
[10:41.95]Get away from me.
[10:44.45]I think that was a Dead Ringer.
[10:45.50]I don't think he's dead.
[10:47.66]Pretty sure he's still alive.
[10:53.24]Might as well go get some health.
[10:54.52]Right?
[10:55.62]Boom.
[10:58.96]Boom.
[11:01.94]Fire!
[11:02.34]Oh no.
[11:03.90]We gotta get on this.
[11:08.95]Oh, jump around!
[11:10.09]So get off your feet and jump around!
[11:11.93]Jump!
[11:12.48]Jump!
[11:13.00]Jump!
[11:13.52]Jump!
[11:14.04]Jump!
[11:14.30]I don't know what the point of that was.
[11:17.24]That was... Oh, my God!
[11:18.34]Oh, no!
[11:20.20]No!
[11:20.42]I'm just, like, jumping around like an idiot.
[11:26.51]I'm not... I'm doing... Eh, I'm doing okay.
[11:31.87]Still no chat.
[11:32.51]This is what it looks like, by the way, for me.
[11:34.61]Like, the wheel of death.
[11:38.09]So I can't answer your questions.
[11:39.37]Oh, that's stupid.
[11:41.41]I'm going to try refreshing it again.
[11:42.73]That's what it looks like.
[11:49.07]Unfortunately... Hold on, I'm going to... Did I get the chat back?
[11:54.10]Did I?
[11:57.22]Of course not.
[12:00.68]Of course not.
[12:05.20]That was a spy.
[12:05.86]My god, that was a Dead Ringer.
[12:08.85]Oh, that was unlucky.
[12:14.45]Look out, look out, look out.
[12:16.59]Oh, that's going to kill me.
[12:17.93]I need the equalizer.
[12:18.79]I need to put the equalizer on.
[12:19.77]We're going to lose.
[12:23.19]If I can help it.
[12:28.95]Stay on it.
[12:29.84]Stay on it.
[12:30.70]Stay on it, my brethren.
[12:33.98]Get that spy.
[12:34.96]And the scout.
[12:36.64]Stay on it, come on.
[12:38.80]Come on, come on, come on.
[12:41.68]Yes.
[12:42.60]Nice job.
[12:43.32]Nice job.
[12:45.13]Good job, guys.
[12:46.33]Look at this guy, just, like, hiding behind, like, the stakeout area.
[12:52.45]Oh, now I got the chat.
[12:56.45]Okay, I just saw MGE's live streaming.
[12:58.39]That's the last thing I saw.
[13:02.78]Oh, I was going for an air shot.
[13:06.36]I'm not hitting people with rockets right now.
[13:07.92]I think every single one of my kills has been with the shotgun.
[13:13.29]Except for that one.
[13:14.25]Except for Burgah Boy.
[13:15.09]I'm not going over there.
[13:22.92]I need help.
[13:23.44]Come on, hit him!
[13:28.00]No, no, no!
[13:29.68]No, no!
[13:33.00]I can't believe I'm that stupid.
[13:36.01]Oh, my God.
[13:38.60]What is wrong with me?
[13:40.14]Yeah, good game, guys.
[13:40.90]Good game.
[13:42.74]Oh, my God.
[13:45.32]I'm just standing there, like, scratching my butt.
[13:51.28]What is going on?
[13:52.06]What the hell is this?
[13:54.26]What is it?
[13:55.54]A prop hunt mod?
[13:58.46]Wow.
[13:59.60]That's pretty cool.
[14:02.50]Alright, we're gonna go in.
[14:03.12]Whatever this is, I'm using it.
[14:04.46]Alright, good.
[14:11.73]Oh, come on, get hit-mocked.
[14:13.13]Get hit-mocking.
[14:14.61]How did I lose all that?
[14:15.65]I thought I was hitting people.
[14:19.79]Oh, I found... Now I can read the chat, so I will... Oh, God.
[14:24.89]So, yes, I will talk about my Steam Workshop item.
[14:27.43]Oh, no, Burgah Boy.
[14:29.57]Just punch him.
[14:31.37]My Steam Workshop item is going well.
[14:33.75]The modeler behind it, he... Thank you, Optimus Prime.
[14:39.28]But the modeler behind it, he had to take a little break from modeling, because I think he just had some school stuff he was trying to get out of the way, and I had some family things he wanted to get done, so it is still going.
[14:50.40]I got a pretzel in my mouth.
[14:54.06]I'm sitting here eating pretzels, and I can't even, like, play.
[14:56.85]Yeah, so probably in a couple weeks, I would assume, will be more updates on that.
[15:01.19]And I'm going to die.
[15:02.45]It's going to take one shot.
[15:03.39]I'm going to go down.
[15:03.91]Might as well make it epic.
[15:07.82]That's a spy.
[15:09.94]How come I didn't get any metal for this?
[15:13.38]Was that not really a spy?
[15:14.56]I swear I bumped into him.
[15:17.82]I swear to every single deity that exists, I was bumping into that guy.
[15:25.28]Oh, man.
[15:26.35]Look at all these dudes in here.
[15:30.69]Yeah, the pretzels I'm eating, they're the, uh... They're the small... Look at me, I'm like, hey, I got one hand playing.
[15:37.13]Okay, okay, I'm gonna... Let me wash this down first.
[15:45.64]Before, I was an idiot.
[15:46.98]Oh, I got a kill.
[15:49.52]They're the small cylinder pretzels, like the best ones.
[15:53.46]I'm not a big fan of the really skinny ones.
[15:56.18]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[15:57.17]The tiny little skinny baby pretzels.
[16:00.33]Meh, not for me.
[16:02.51]Now, let's actually stop playing this game.
[16:06.81]You know what?
[16:07.35]I want this.
[16:12.13]There we go.
[16:14.05]There we go.
[16:17.58]Are you a spy?
[16:18.46]I bet you are.
[16:19.52]Oh no, here comes Burgah Boy.
[16:21.76]The insensitive one.
[16:25.86]Have demo and subscribe.
[16:28.34]I can't.
[16:28.62]I've got to shoot somebody.
[16:29.42]Come on.
[16:29.88]One good meat shot on someone.
[16:31.04]Do you want some hats?
[16:40.01]Jerma?
[16:40.59]No, I'm good.
[16:42.15]I'm good to go.
[16:43.01]Thank you for offering, though.
[16:44.43]I appreciate that.
[16:46.55]I don't need any items or anything.
[16:48.13]Oh, boy.
[16:48.49]Pyro coming in.
[16:53.23]Oh, come on.
[16:55.74]Come on!
[16:56.92]Oh no!
[16:57.64]I'm dead!
[17:01.10]I didn't mean to taunt, by the way.
[17:02.16]I was just trying not to die.
[17:08.64]The chat is back, thank goodness.
[17:13.62]Can I play some payload?
[17:14.57]Of course.
[17:15.65]I'm going to try to find a good gold rush or bad water map after this.
[17:20.15]What are we looking like?
[17:22.73]That's fine.
[17:24.86]I don't know why.
[17:25.82]I'll put it right here.
[17:28.62]Give me those hit markers.
[17:33.57]Gosh darn it.
[17:36.13]Am I a fan of Frank Sinatra?
[17:38.57]Yeah.
[17:39.23]Who couldn't be with a voice like that?
[17:41.83]Luck be a lady tonight.
[17:44.54]Luck be a lady tonight.
[17:46.96]Luck if you've ever killed Jerma in Team Fortress.
[17:49.78]Luck be a scout tonight.
[17:52.56]I apologize for doing that.
[17:54.30]That was not... That was not cool.
[17:56.58]Oh, my God!
[17:59.16]I'm going to die again.
[18:00.50]No.
[18:00.98]No, can I make it?
[18:02.00]Take your bets.
[18:02.68]Do I make it to the... Do I make it?
[18:03.68]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[18:09.49]Oh, come on.
[18:11.47]I had my finger touching.
[18:15.21]I was reaching for it, too, and everything.
[18:17.13]Give me a break.
[18:19.77]Oh, well.
[18:20.89]Alright, it's time.
[18:22.35]Are you...
[18:24.60]Every time I get out of spawn, something bad happens.
[18:27.96]At least I'm getting kills with a Mini-Sentry.
[18:30.91]That's one good thing that comes out of all this.
[18:32.97]You know what?
[18:37.59]I'm going to move it.
[18:39.11]I want it up here.
[18:40.83]Oh my god.
[18:42.21]You toast bastard.
[18:48.32]How much was TF2?
[18:49.20]TF2 was 10 bucks.
[18:51.40]I think it was originally 20, wasn't it?
[18:54.53]1999 for a while, and then it went to 9.
[18:56.83]Did it ever go to 9.99?
[18:57.41]I don't remember it being 9.99.
[18:58.77]Maybe it's because I just never bought it.
[19:01.61]That's a crit.
[19:02.11]I'm dead.
[19:05.52]I was trying to strafe and drop down, not in the pit, and I ended up landing on the crit.
[19:09.74]Well, you know what?
[19:12.10]We're going to change this.
[19:17.12]Oh, by the way, I'm going to say this here just because, you know, it makes sense to say it here.
[19:23.40]I still have to give away 33% of that backpack, because it's been about five days and the third person still has not responded.
[19:31.88]So I'm going to give them maybe another 48 hours, and if I still don't see anything, we're going to talk about maybe another small giveaway.
[19:42.59]Potentially in the stream.
[19:43.99]If I do it on Twitter, I do it on Twitter, but I've not decided at this point what I'm going to do.
[19:53.40]I'll probably just re-pick.
[19:56.24]Ow.
[19:58.82]Oh, put me out!
[19:59.96]Put me out!
[20:01.54]I was behind you!
[20:04.96]I have not played Gotham City Impostors.
[20:07.88]I heard it's fun, though.
[20:14.60]Are we gonna win?
[20:17.58]Oh, they're gonna get it.
[20:19.58]They are absolutely gonna get this.
[20:24.79]I'm going up here.
[20:26.67]I'm absolutely going up here.
[20:28.92]Good.
[20:29.94]I'm protecting this room.
[20:31.18]This health is mine for the rest of this god damn game.
[20:35.66]What?
[20:36.74]Oh my god, what?
[20:38.48]What's going on?
[20:39.46]What?
[20:40.06]What is it?
[20:41.00]What's happening?
[20:42.82]Oh my god.
[20:45.25]During the live stream.
[20:47.17]Um, hold on.
[20:47.83]Hold on a second.
[20:50.77]I... That just took me totally off guard.
[20:55.06]Um, thank you so much for that.
[20:58.12]Hold on, let me accept it.
[20:58.96]Hold on, let me even see what just even happened.
[21:05.74]Hold on, I gotta duck away for one second.
[21:08.70]Oh, we won.
[21:09.26]Okay, cool.
[21:11.42]What is that?
[21:11.86]What's happening right now?
[21:15.25]Where is it?
[21:17.09]You've received a gift.
[21:19.41]Total War Shogun 2.
[21:20.73]Oh my god.
[21:23.13]Oh, this is from my wedding partner.
[21:27.24]Oh, my God.
[21:27.70]I have to show this.
[21:28.32]I forgot to show this off.
[21:29.66]So, this guy right here, this suicidal engineer is what his name is.
[21:33.34]He sent me the ring.
[21:35.87]Where is it?
[21:38.49]Where's my diamond ring?
[21:39.87]Look at that.
[21:41.45]Special something for special someone.
[21:43.36]So, thank you so much.
[21:45.49]I wanted to really mention that, but yes, I will accept this.
[21:48.43]Yeah, this is like the Team Fortress 2, like, Valentine's... It's not Wednesday, it's like Valentine's Day.
[21:53.71]But, yeah.
[21:54.77]Special shout-out to that guy, because that's really, really thoughtful.
[21:58.05]So now I can accept your gift.
[22:01.46]I, like, don't even know how to do it.
[22:02.62]Where is it?
[22:04.98]Alright.
[22:05.86]I accept.
[22:07.52]Thank you.
[22:08.86]Thank you so much.
[22:10.62]Add to my game library.
[22:11.74]I will absolutely play this.
[22:14.36]Thank you so much.
[22:15.55]That's all I can say.
[22:16.41]You're awesome.
[22:17.01]Thank you.
[22:19.44]Oh, our little Jervish is growing up now.
[22:22.04]Yeah, that's awesome.
[22:23.10]That's not a good way to go.
[22:30.94]Yeah, I did see the new Grodbart stuff.
[22:33.44]The new Grod... How do you even say that?
[22:35.15]I always say that wrong.
[22:36.35]Grodbrorts.
[22:38.55]Grodbrort.
[22:41.09]Grodbot.
[22:44.93]Oh my god, every time!
[22:47.00]Every time I exit spawn.
[22:50.50]Alright, you know what?
[22:51.42]I'm going... I am going to just plant... You know what?
[22:53.66]No.
[22:53.94]I'm killing this guy first.
[22:55.56]Or running away.
[22:56.24]That works as well.
[23:00.41]Protect this room.
[23:01.25]Let's at least get some area denial going here.
[23:05.17]This guy's down here.
[23:05.85]This guy knows I'm here.
[23:06.73]Where is he?
[23:09.87]Change it.
[23:10.33]Right here.
[23:11.13]Oh, what?
[23:11.67]What?
[23:12.09]That's a big sentry!
[23:13.71]That is a big sentry.
[23:16.53]My goodness.
[23:18.71]Oh, my God.
[23:21.07]Alright, alright.
[23:22.13]Time to go scout.
[23:25.44]Time to go scout.
[23:27.92]I'm going to use... Oh, no.
[23:29.50]Oh, that's right.
[23:30.50]You know what?
[23:30.94]For the sake of my backpack being gone, we're going to go all default.
[23:37.78]At least item-wise.
[23:41.94]Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
[23:44.65]You are not real.
[23:47.66]And you're probably still alive.
[23:54.94]I can't believe I just did that.
[23:57.00]I can't believe it.
[23:57.94]I can't believe that just happened.
[24:00.16]I can't believe I just did that.
[24:01.98]I got behind two people.
[24:04.15]I want to just go punch myself in the face.
[24:08.23]With like an iron.
[24:12.61]Oh my god.
[24:17.10]That is really depressing.
[24:19.14]You know what I mean?
[24:19.96]It's just like, I got behind those two guys.
[24:23.26]That one soldier.
[24:29.80]God.
[24:32.16]And there was a crit.
[24:33.10]And I missed.
[24:36.75]That's a spy coming up.
[24:39.03]I need help.
[24:39.47]He's going to headshot me.
[24:41.19]This always happens.
[24:46.19]Why did I just hit E?
[24:50.47]God.
[24:52.87]This is a spy.
[24:56.11]Maybe not.
[24:56.75]Let's bump.
[24:58.01]No, it's Ahri.
[24:58.56]Hey, Ahri.
[24:59.26]Alright, let's go.
[25:03.56]Let's go.
[25:03.96]Let's go.
[25:06.10]That's a bad place to go.
[25:08.84]What?
[25:10.66]What?
[25:11.80]What?
[25:13.82]What just happened?
[25:16.31]That guy shot me through the staircase.
[25:18.70]I am mad.
[25:19.60]Alright, I'm putting the milk on.
[25:22.04]I need my milk.
[25:24.20]I need my calcium.
[25:27.78]My calcium for the week.
[25:34.15]If I were to have any unusual effect on a hat, or any unusual, I would want the, uh, what is it?
[25:39.29]The searing, towering pillar of hats.
[25:42.40]Because isn't that worth like five million dollars or something?
[25:45.38]Isn't that a lot of money?
[25:47.24]Oh, two soldiers.
[25:47.94]I can't deal with that.
[25:48.82]And a scout.
[25:50.92]And I have milk.
[25:51.94]I threw it.
[25:53.02]Oh my goodness gracious.
[25:58.25]How much... Somebody tell me.
[25:59.81]What is the most expensive Team Fortress hat?
[26:01.81]Like in dollars.
[26:02.77]In US dollars.
[26:04.95]Is it Searing Towering Pillar or Sunlight Towering Pillar?
[26:07.49]Is it like two thousand dollars or something crazy?
[26:10.97]God.
[26:13.93]What is the approximation of the value of that item?
[26:20.33]I can't even go after him.
[26:21.19]I have no health.
[26:25.41]Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[26:27.73]Someone just has to, like, burp on me and I'm going to die.
[26:33.57]Please don't burp on me.
[26:34.66]I don't want to die.
[26:35.20]There we go.
[26:39.50]I have played LA Noire.
[26:41.82]Oh, pfft.
[26:44.33]What?
[26:45.83]Oh... That just made me sad, what just happened.
[26:49.15]I'm not even mad about that.
[26:50.37]I'm just, like, upset.
[26:51.69]I just want to cry.
[26:54.65]Candy cane.
[26:58.22]Sunbeam's TC is about 40 buds.
[27:01.22]So how much is one bud?
[27:03.44]How much is one bud US dollars?
[27:09.76]Get in there.
[27:11.00]Come on, did I get him?
[27:12.12]Yeah, I did.
[27:15.07]Get rid of that mini-sinter.
[27:16.05]I can't even go over there.
[27:19.45]I can't even go anywhere.
[27:21.63]I can't take you anywhere, Scout.
[27:25.80]Hi, spawn.
[27:26.60]Bye, spawn.
[27:30.02]I can't go over there.
[27:31.06]God.
[27:36.06]Oh, that's not the right taunt.
[27:38.48]Wait, we failed?
[27:39.44]Wait, I thought we were... I thought...
[27:44.32]I thought we were winning.
[27:45.32]I thought we had the point.
[27:47.86]Well, that's, uh... So, one butt is $35, so... That's a lot of money.
[27:56.02]That is a lot of money.
[27:58.44]Let's go to... Alright, new server.
[28:00.90]New server.
[28:02.36]Thanks to you guys in this server right now.
[28:03.78]We're going to trade.
[28:05.22]Trade servers.
[28:06.61]Let's try and get on a payload.
[28:08.93]Payload race.
[28:09.93]No, no payload race.
[28:10.67]I don't like payload race.
[28:12.13]I do, but it can be too chaotic.
[28:16.11]Peel bad water and too many bots.
[28:18.73]People won't be able to get in so easily.
[28:20.57]Here we go.
[28:21.03]Hoodoo.
[28:21.83]There we go.
[28:22.59]Abso-freaking-lutely hoodoo.
[28:25.83]It's going in the chat right now.
[28:27.97]This is the IP.
[28:28.91]There you are, ladies and gents.
[28:35.91]The last giveaway winner... I sent him a Twitter message, and he still hasn't replied.
[28:41.54]I'm going to shell check right now.
[28:45.51]That was a long time ago.
[28:46.21]That was a while ago.
[28:48.83]So, be on the lookout in the next week or the next three or four days.
[28:52.59]I may be picking another person on Twitter for this 33% of this backpack.
[29:01.20]I want your items.
[29:03.24]I want all your items.
[29:08.05]I'm probably going to play Tower Defense again, because that was fun.
[29:12.84]Bloons Tower Defense.
[29:16.38]Here's the IP again, for those of you wondering.
[29:20.24]That is the IP, right?
[29:21.36]Let me make sure.
[29:24.92]Yes, it is.
[29:25.39]That is the IP.
[29:27.67]Let's do Sniper.
[29:32.87]I don't think I've really ever done a Scope Sniper on a stream before, so you know what?
[29:36.51]We're going to do it.
[29:40.00]And I need, like, a hat.
[29:41.56]I need, like, a hat.
[29:42.22]One of these, like, party hats and, like, sunglasses.
[29:46.63]Oh, yeah.
[29:46.97]High five.
[29:48.13]Ship boom.
[29:50.77]Pro ping right here.
[29:52.05]How much ping?
[29:53.29]That's not that bad, Norman.
[29:55.43]That's not too terrible.
[29:57.89]I'd say if you got to, like, 160 or 150, you should start to, you know, count your blessings.
[30:08.54]Oh, my God.
[30:08.98]Boo.
[30:10.72]Yeah, boo, sorry there's, like, no Skype call.
[30:13.00]I was, uh... I was running very, very, very late.
[30:16.55]More than an hour late to the stream, so I had to just go.
[30:22.95]Oh, I just can't see.
[30:23.89]What is this guy doing?
[30:24.87]What?
[30:27.45]That guy was, like, standing in the creator character position.
[30:34.86]I'm a little too close.
[30:36.72]You know what?
[30:37.02]This is a bad spot.
[30:37.76]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[30:39.28]Yeah, I knew it.
[30:40.61]That's a bad spot.
[30:43.27]Late to his own stream, as usual.
[30:51.84]Yeah, I do frequently... I'm always at least five, ten minutes late.
[30:57.82]Hey, better late than never, though, right?
[31:00.60]Isn't that the old adage?
[31:03.98]Is that even an adage?
[31:06.30]Oh, my cat's in here now.
[31:07.98]Going...
[31:10.49]Let's get a couple of headshots, huh?
[31:17.13]There goes the engineer that's in the creator character stance.
[31:22.59]What?
[31:23.59]Oh boy.
[31:24.74]Where is he?
[31:26.56]I didn't cover him.
[31:27.32]My god, what a total idiot I am.
[31:33.00]Stop the bloody boom!
[31:38.28]Ow!
[31:38.44]Ow!
[31:39.61]right in my face.
[31:40.37]Am I going to play Left 4 Dead 2?
[31:44.93]Probably not on this stream tonight, but I absolutely love that game, so probably at some point, yeah.
[31:53.82]Will you stop meowing?
[31:54.72]You're ruining my stream, cat.
[31:57.60]Meowing.
[32:01.39]Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.
[32:09.58]Oh my god.
[32:12.54]Hey, you look like you could use some pee on your back.
[32:14.86]I'll, like, throw it right into one of my teammates' backs.
[32:16.86]I just puked.
[32:26.90]Cat.
[32:28.40]I gotta switch.
[32:29.21]I gotta go heavy.
[32:30.35]They're gonna win.
[32:32.29]Gotta go heavy with the Brass Beast.
[32:35.77]And I'm just gonna stand in a corner and just hold down this damn button.
[32:39.53]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[32:40.97]Don't let him get it!
[32:41.91]Don't let him get it!
[32:44.42]No!
[32:44.92]No, I gotta get- I gotta get right up on here.
[32:49.92]Bye.
[32:51.68]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[32:53.90]Just gonna eat the sandwich on the cart!
[32:56.70]Oh my god.
[33:02.01]Oh yeah.
[33:03.19]Heavy turtling.
[33:03.99]What do you know about heavy turtles?
[33:06.19]The two heavy turtles.
[33:10.70]This is actually going to work.
[33:14.42]Who needs sentry guns when you've got three super heavies?
[33:17.30]Are these two the same person?
[33:19.50]Oh no, they have different hats.
[33:20.42]What do we got?
[33:25.33]I think we're good.
[33:27.09]Oh, they're coming up there.
[33:30.17]Oh, heal me!
[33:32.11]Help me!
[33:34.64]Teenage Mutant Ninja Heavy Alien Turtles.
[33:42.76]So I know I asked this before, but I couldn't see the chat.
[33:44.64]Is the audio fine?
[33:45.76]Can you hear me?
[33:46.30]And is the stream too loud?
[33:47.62]Or are we just right?
[33:49.60]As Goldilocks would say.
[33:59.03]That's good.
[33:59.91]That's good.
[34:05.67]You cannot defeat the heavy.
[34:07.77]I just bumped into someone.
[34:11.01]For sure.
[34:12.87]You can always tell when you, you know, you never know if it's lag, or you actually are bumping into someone, and that's, I don't want to get hit by that again.
[34:19.62]Oh, for the love of all that is sacred.
[34:25.02]Ditto, 0-0-0.
[34:27.06]How are you, man?
[34:36.41]Look at, I love this heavy, look at this guy.
[34:38.99]That is a true heavy right there.
[34:40.99]Standing on the cart with sunglasses, a luchador mask, and a Russian hat on.
[34:47.96]What a goofy, goofy person.
[34:49.54]I love him.
[34:53.36]Oh, my goodness.
[34:56.12]Oh, I have on the Brass Beast.
[34:58.65]Can't move.
[34:59.55]Must punch.
[35:00.37]Someone in face.
[35:01.75]Nope, not gonna happen.
[35:04.99]I heard a backstab.
[35:06.81]Oh, I'm so scared right now.
[35:13.63]That is the worst part about the Brass Beast.
[35:16.51]If you get Ubered and there's people like 50, 100 feet away from you, it's all over.
[35:21.85]Because by the time you run up there, it's just like, oh, everyone just turn around the corner and run away.
[35:30.31]I'm sorry.
[35:33.94]You know, we could use... I don't know what I want to do
[35:44.05]Pyro.
[35:45.19]Sad old, I'm going Pyro.
[35:49.81]Best Gorilla song is absolutely Stylo.
[35:52.49]Either Stylo, or you know what?
[35:53.65]This is going to sound weird, but I actually like Dare.
[35:56.61]You've got the credit for you.
[35:59.99]I don't know the lyrics of that song.
[36:04.88]I do know the lyrics of the song, but they're very odd.
[36:10.02]Oh, pyro on pyro fight.
[36:11.47]That's... You are not real.
[36:13.13]That's not me.
[36:14.03]I didn't just look in a mirror.
[36:14.95]That wasn't me.
[36:16.63]Bumping into somebody.
[36:18.83]Watch your backs.
[36:22.19]Oh, he turned and just smoked me.
[36:31.74]I started listening to the Gorillas because they are a great band.
[36:35.10]I'm glad you got to listen to them.
[36:38.34]Because they're awesome.
[36:43.59]My cat right now is just sitting under the... I thought you were fake.
[36:49.29]Literally just sitting underneath my legs, just rubbing up against my legs over and over again, and I just want to be like, cat, get out of here, but I can't because he's too cute.
[37:02.22]Ugh.
[37:02.44]Gotta find a way.
[37:11.20]I'm gonna go around here.
[37:16.19]Die!
[37:16.85]Die!
[37:17.93]How much health do you have?
[37:21.44]Heal me!
[37:24.96]Oh, we found him.
[37:25.70]We got a winner.
[37:33.26]We got a winner.
[37:38.17]Come here, come here.
[37:38.99]Watch out.
[37:41.43]No!
[37:41.93]No!
[37:42.35]Stay alive!
[37:43.11]Thank you.
[37:45.70]I'm gonna run out of ammo.
[37:50.30]Oh, shoot me!
[37:54.14]Shoot me!
[37:54.98]Shoot me!
[37:57.51]Oh, that would have been a crit.
[37:59.77]Get him!
[38:02.99]Oh my god.
[38:05.33]What just happened?
[38:07.29]Somebody look at what just happened.
[38:09.25]What just even happened right there, guys?
[38:13.20]What did I reflect?
[38:15.35]I tried to put the heavy out that was on fire.
[38:18.41]What even just happened?
[38:21.38]That was very, very odd.
[38:23.68]Maybe I reflected a... I'm so confused.
[38:31.40]Let me put this heavy out and hear the crit noise and then kill somebody.
[38:34.36]Like, what?
[38:37.92]So that was you that I just killed.
[38:39.10]I have no idea how it happened.
[38:46.66]Where is he?
[38:47.80]Whoa!
[38:49.48]Oh, he's a sniper.
[38:50.21]Damn.
[38:51.19]Damn.
[38:53.11]Whoa, hold on.
[38:55.31]Stuff's freaking out here.
[38:59.51]Gotcha.
[39:03.84]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[39:08.90]Back to Kata.
[39:10.04]Back to Kata.
[39:10.52]Oh, my God, they're going to win.
[39:12.72]Oh, sup, Berger?
[39:14.92]So, Burgah Boy, you gotta, like, are you raging yet?
[39:17.17]Are you on, oh, you're on this, no, you're on the other team.
[39:19.43]Burgah Boy, why are you not, like, freaking out right now?
[39:22.93]No, no, no!
[39:24.83]Trying to put people out.
[39:28.82]Oh, man, nice team Uber.
[39:30.14]Nice team Uber, Ari.
[39:31.68]Oh, here he comes.
[39:32.28]Ah, damn it!
[39:35.92]Damn it, damn it!
[39:36.82]Ah, bleh, I'm upset.
[39:41.83]I'm going, Medic.
[39:44.60]I thought for sure I was going to time that, but he had the direct hit.
[39:47.22]He got killed by Herp and Derp.
[39:54.99]At the same time, they both killed me.
[39:59.55]Where is Grandpa?
[40:00.67]Did you see my latest vlog talking about that?
[40:03.41]Oh my god.
[40:04.26]Spies everywhere.
[40:08.00]In my latest vlog, I talk about Grandpa.
[40:11.24]And what's... Oh my god, they're behind us.
[40:18.40]No, don't die!
[40:21.00]Just... I'm gonna sit down here.
[40:23.42]No, I'm not.
[40:26.34]Oh god!
[40:27.68]Oh my god!
[40:30.65]I was so concerned about getting shot from behind from people on the cart that I... Oh, we won!
[40:36.25]There we go.
[40:37.91]Cool.
[40:42.32]I do want to play Grand Theft Auto on a stream.
[40:44.46]I really do.
[40:46.14]It's just the only problem with Grand Theft Auto is it's very poorly optimized on the PC.
[40:51.74]So it can be very difficult to even record that game.
[40:55.16]So it's something I would have to look into, try to make it run at a little bit lower settings maybe.
[41:00.27]Because that game takes almost like 5,000% CPU when you try and play it on good settings.
[41:09.95]Now this will be the last round in this server and we're going to go somewhere else.
[41:14.38]Oh, look at you.
[41:15.08]You match.
[41:16.34]Don't you just look so beautiful?
[41:21.54]Alright, here we go.
[41:26.88]Oh, look.
[41:27.16]My spray.
[41:27.62]My spray's cold.
[41:30.49]Who wants this?
[41:32.53]Who's getting this?
[41:33.51]I don't know yet.
[41:34.53]You're all good players.
[41:35.49]I don't know who's going to get it.
[41:38.51]I guess the person that I do it to is the person that's going to get it.
[41:41.09]So, be on the lookout.
[41:46.91]No trades!
[41:48.70]Not right now.
[41:50.52]Look at what you guys are doing.
[41:53.10]And why is everybody pink?
[41:55.12]Everybody's like... We're about to go driving Miss Daisy.
[42:00.26]And... do it!
[42:02.18]Demo spam everywhere.
[42:07.43]What is happening?
[42:09.19]Oh my god, what... Oh, man.
[42:14.85]Am I excited for Borderlands 2?
[42:17.60]Yeah, I guess.
[42:19.50]Borderlands 1, I was... I had a good time with it.
[42:23.31]But, I don't know, you have to really play that game with other people.
[42:26.61]You can't really play that game alone.
[42:27.93]It's too... It's just not my type of game to play by myself.
[42:32.19]But I would probably play it with other people, for sure, and make videos.
[42:35.31]Absolutely.
[42:38.96]There's a spy, for sure.
[42:41.50]Like, look at this crowd of people.
[42:43.18]There's gotta be a spy stuck somewhere in here.
[42:47.92]Oh my god, where are you?
[42:48.68]I need to heal you.
[42:49.96]I just saw him.
[42:51.10]Come here!
[42:51.54]Come here!
[42:52.08]Come here!
[42:52.90]Oh!
[42:56.02]Hey, at least I did that, right?
[42:57.64]At least I avenged you.
[42:59.50]What?
[43:01.48]Oh, Ari, you ready?
[43:02.72]Boom.
[43:04.04]Crits everywhere.
[43:06.40]Probably should have saved that, but, you know.
[43:08.80]Oh my god.
[43:12.70]No!
[43:13.14]No!
[43:14.51]Get out of here!
[43:17.20]Oh, backed up right into a knife.
[43:19.18]Right into a knife.
[43:21.94]I'm going to spell out what I want to say, but I'm not going to say it.
[43:24.86]S-H-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-T.
[43:28.39]And then as many exclamation points you can put on the end of that sentence.
[43:33.67]That's how I feel right now.
[43:36.79]I got you, I got you.
[43:38.95]Put that away.
[43:41.21]Let me hear you.
[43:41.91]Ha ha ha.
[43:47.99]Oh, boy.
[43:49.39]Final push.
[43:50.91]Oh, wouldn't it be great to be on defense right now with a Crit's Creek as a Demoman and kill every single person standing right here?
[43:56.86]My goodness.
[43:59.22]I think we're going to get it.
[43:59.94]Let's try and get these people staying healed.
[44:08.15]That's one way.
[44:08.75]Alright, nice job, guys.
[44:11.35]Crit needles!
[44:12.43]Oh!
[44:14.84]Oh my god, they just respawned.
[44:17.16]Oh my god.
[44:20.21]You want to talk about a way to burn out a hard drive?
[44:23.27]A graphics card?
[44:24.15]Oh my god.
[44:25.73]Speaking of that, let me make sure I'm not going to explode here.
[44:29.95]I say this every time.
[44:30.79]No, I'm good.
[44:32.37]I'm good.
[44:33.85]We're good to go.
[44:37.10]We're good.
[44:39.88]Alright, changing servers one more time.
[44:41.44]Disconnect.
[44:43.10]Disconnect.
[44:44.32]Browse servers.
[44:46.35]Refresh.
[44:53.85]Favorite class is Engineer.
[44:56.07]Then probably Huntsman Sniper.
[44:57.76]I don't know.
[44:59.24]I change it.
[44:59.70]My mind changes on a daily basis, so it's hard to say what my favorite class is.
[45:08.60]Let's go to a... We could always go to good old... Oh, Gravel Pit.
[45:13.19]Gravel Pit, for sure.
[45:16.66]Play a couple more rounds on here.
[45:17.88]And there's the IP.
[45:20.30]Yeah, IP.
[45:26.26]Oh, there's decals.
[45:28.56]Maybe it's going to be cool looking.
[45:30.34]Maybe.
[45:32.18]Maybe.
[45:34.24]Oh, the reason why I don't accept trade requests during streams is because I like to keep the action as high as I can keep it.
[45:41.92]Like, I'm sure people don't want to, you know, oh, I'm in a trade.
[45:44.98]What am I going to get?
[45:45.96]Like, let's do some trading.
[45:47.83]I guess maybe that could be entertaining to some people, but I like to keep the action flowing.
[45:53.45]I'll go blue this time.
[45:55.83]And I'm going to play Spy.
[46:00.73]With my revolver, my Spicycle.
[46:04.26]Actually, I just got this.
[46:05.20]I might as well use these things.
[46:08.42]Totally strange.
[46:09.80]Strange.
[46:11.42]I don't have a strange sapper.
[46:14.22]Too bad.
[46:16.38]Too bad.
[46:18.76]Oh.
[46:21.04]Medic!
[46:22.34]Doctor!
[46:23.86]Medic!
[46:26.40]Doctor!
[46:29.39]Doctor!
[46:29.93]Alright, that's enough of that.
[46:31.75]Wait a second, it's...
[46:33.30]I thought I was waiting for setup time.
[46:34.52]Apparently there's no... Okay.
[46:36.66]It's just happening.
[46:40.07]Oh, I'm looking at the chat right now.
[46:41.31]I'm not even looking at my screen.
[46:44.19]Um, I just tried to give it.
[46:47.63]That's weird.
[46:49.99]Okay, so the chat just screwed up.
[46:52.13]Can anyone see what I just wrote, by the way?
[46:53.61]Dude, can you guys see the IP?
[46:57.81]Can you guys see the IP?
[47:02.35]Because apparently it's Twitch.
[47:07.23]What are you saying, Burgah Boy?
[47:08.21]Oh, Burgah Boy.
[47:17.33]I'm so confused right now.
[47:19.93]I don't know why I think I'm red.
[47:21.65]I'm looking at the chat.
[47:22.43]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[47:30.78]Oh my goodness, pull out the deadbreaker.
[47:32.52]I don't have it.
[47:34.67]I do have it.
[47:40.65]Hey, I'm a scout, don't shoot me!
[47:42.83]Oh no!
[47:49.94]Oh god, run!
[47:58.15]Oh no!
[48:02.13]Please?
[48:03.73]Oh.
[48:03.95]So did you guys hear my idea for a spy video?
[48:08.15]I think I said it last stream.
[48:09.61]Oh my god.
[48:10.77]Oh my god.
[48:15.93]That is... That is a... If you've never seen that spray before, that is Burgah Boy spray.
[48:23.44]And he is a disgusting human being.
[48:30.88]God dang it.
[48:32.45]I'm in trouble.
[48:34.53]Hey!
[48:34.87]I'll just go this way, then.
[48:38.42]Crap.
[48:40.92]Instant respawn, my goodness.
[48:42.28]I think we're about to win.
[48:45.08]Alright, let's, like, get, like, a new round started, so I'm not so confused.
[48:53.11]I don't wanna be confused.
[48:56.71]I don't wanna fall asleep, cause I... That's two songs combined in one.
[49:05.27]I miss you babe, and I don't want to miss a thang.
[49:09.28]Cause even when I... God, come on.
[49:18.61]My hands are in my face right now.
[49:21.05]I really thought I was going to get that stair stab.
[49:25.41]I really thought I was going to get it.
[49:28.30]And it didn't happen.
[49:29.40]And I crouched in everything.
[49:35.32]I did.
[49:35.66]I crouched.
[49:36.40]I did crouch.
[49:37.06]Oh, you're going to taunt?
[49:38.06]Are you ready to get headshot?
[49:40.87]He's going to get away.
[49:44.29]I'm just running right into people again.
[49:56.00]Oh my god.
[50:01.70]I'm not supposed to do this.
[50:08.13]I'm just going to be like the tank.
[50:09.49]Yeah, heal me.
[50:17.11]Spy's not working right now.
[50:18.83]I'm not playing Spy anymore.
[50:22.56]A lot of you guys know this.
[50:23.50]I've said this before.
[50:24.84]Playing Spy on a livestream is like pulling teeth out of my brain.
[50:30.41]Like, when I play Spy, I need 100% concentration, and if I don't have that, it's like... I'm essentially regressed to being, like, nine years old.
[50:43.40]Oh, dat life, com.
[50:51.27]Oh my goodness.
[50:53.17]Did it even have a... Okay, that didn't hit anybody.
[50:56.85]Oh my god.
[50:59.81]Bottle!
[51:00.61]Attack of the Bottle!
[51:09.02]Kroba.
[51:11.60]Kroba is my best friend on this team.
[51:14.68]Because his name is Kroba.
[51:16.83]And I can say it.
[51:26.83]Where is he?
[51:27.45]Nope.
[51:32.85]Lock and load.
[51:38.21]You want to go, bottle?
[51:39.47]You want to go with the bottle?
[51:46.51]He's gone.
[51:46.97]He's gone.
[51:47.47]Don't worry.
[51:47.75]We got it.
[51:48.25]We got it.
[51:48.61]We're good.
[51:54.21]Where is it?
[51:54.56]Is there something up there?
[51:57.24]There's nothing up here.
[51:58.76]Except this one dude.
[52:01.00]Oh.
[52:01.06]What did I get hit by?
[52:03.94]Uh, Rocket.
[52:05.82]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
[52:35.76]Sticky Tack.
[52:38.11]Worst item in the game?
[52:39.01]Oople Caber.
[52:43.15]In my opinion.
[52:44.67]I do not like that thing.
[52:46.49]I think it's just a dumb weapon.
[52:49.21]I don't know.
[52:49.96]I never use it.
[52:51.08]And I think it's just a suicide weapon, in my opinion.
[52:54.86]Which, there's not something terribly wrong with that, but... I build your Uber for you, look.
[53:02.25]Oh, I missed the high five.
[53:03.17]I'm sorry.
[53:05.30]Alright, everybody, place your bets.
[53:08.00]How many people are going to watch the stream right now and see what I'm doing and just not open this door?
[53:12.38]I bet every single person is not here right now, except for this one dude who might die.
[53:23.34]No.
[53:23.84]Oh, if I could just wait one more second.
[53:32.08]Sticky tank.
[53:34.97]That's a spy.
[53:38.67]They're all going A, huh?
[53:49.04]Get over here.
[53:52.78]Oh, he's not dead.
[53:55.10]Oh, for the love of goodness gracious.
[53:59.98]Oh my god, get rid of this guy.
[54:03.34]blowing us all around like Hot Pockets.
[54:06.22]That analogy did not make very much sense, now did it?
[54:22.21]I wonder what that looked like on his screen.
[54:25.15]That must have been so funny.
[54:27.25]He must have saw that coming.
[54:28.31]What?
[54:29.45]What?
[54:30.79]Oh, he's up there.
[54:37.47]Oh, my God, dude.
[54:39.75]Oh, that was so funny.
[54:47.13]Defend the point.
[54:56.60]Oh.
[55:00.72]Oh, another lucky crit.
[55:01.66]I'm sorry about that.
[55:03.94]I backed into another knife.
[55:06.74]Gosh darn it.
[55:09.14]With a capital D. Is the chat slow for anybody?
[55:12.66]I can't see anything.
[55:14.70]Ah, there we go.
[55:17.28]Apps a positive allutely, my friend.
[55:19.86]Towering pillar of hats.
[55:21.48]Two dudes with it.
[55:22.88]Except I'm not gonna have it for very long.
[55:30.24]You're still alive.
[55:35.38]Oh my god, you are a spy.
[55:38.59]He's still alive.
[55:39.79]How many... how many does it take?
[55:43.06]I do play in windowed mode.
[55:44.68]I have to, to stream it.
[55:52.43]How much health does he have?
[55:53.93]He must have had a bunch of heads.
[55:57.69]I don't trust you.
[55:59.59]I don't trust you, you snake.
[56:07.52]Oh, don't you back up into that.
[56:09.49]I can't believe I didn't hit him.
[56:11.49]I am so shocked and appalled.
[56:13.65]My god.
[56:21.66]There we do.
[56:22.62]What?
[56:22.92]I thought we got rid of him.
[56:24.60]I thought somebody killed him.
[56:27.60]How many spies are on that team?
[56:29.73]One, two, three, four, three.
[56:37.79]Yeah, I'm not doing too well either, so don't worry.
[56:46.16]I'm on that guy's head.
[56:47.26]I was just standing on his head.
[56:53.15]Oh, God.
[56:54.59]I'm scared.
[56:57.13]I wish I'd... If I was standing, that would've been so cool.
[57:02.19]Of course I put the crit down right in front of my face.
[57:04.03]Is that guy still up here?
[57:08.02]I think he is.
[57:10.68]Oh, yeah, he is.
[57:11.44]I found him.
[57:13.58]Alright, no more Demoman.
[57:17.30]Not doing hot with him.
[57:18.80]Let's go back to Pyro.
[57:21.16]Let's do Reserve Shooter.
[57:31.13]Come here, let me put you out, Engineer.
[57:35.46]Dude, I'm just the designated putter-router people of person.
[57:44.79]Oh, get back here.
[57:48.43]God, let me reload.
[57:52.58]Good, good, good.
[57:53.72]Oh, God, crit streak.
[57:54.54]I don't know if you want to give it to me.
[57:55.62]It might be a total failure.
[58:01.32]Oh, my God.
[58:02.00]He's still up there.
[58:06.48]Oh, get rid of him!
[58:12.61]Oh, no!
[58:16.05]Oh, he's still alive.
[58:16.87]I need more bullets in this damn thing!
[58:23.21]What's my opinion on the royal wedding?
[58:26.69]Um... That's cool, I guess.
[58:30.18]People getting married.
[58:33.98]It's Wales, right?
[58:35.06]Prince, I think I could be totally wrong.
[58:37.68]Boo, don't be mad at me if I don't know that answer.
[58:41.30]Because, of course, if you don't know, Boo, BooMan61 is from Wales.
[58:45.37]If you didn't know, there's a little bit of a... I'm trying to think of the word.
[58:49.77]Trivia!
[58:51.45]Though I'm sure everyone knows that anyways.
[58:53.83]Oh, jeez.
[58:55.80]That guy did a double jump.
[58:56.86]Go this way.
[59:02.30]Oh, yeah, duh, let me get stuck on the wall.
[59:05.94]What was that?
[59:08.72]This guy is lagging very badly.
[59:10.98]I'm sorry.
[59:11.72]I apologize for the lag, dude.
[59:13.92]I'm sorry.
[59:14.47]Let's go this way.
[59:19.45]Yeah, that's true.
[59:20.23]Oh, come on.
[59:20.67]I have new items.
[59:21.43]What?
[59:32.15]I haven't died yet.
[59:36.12]I got a feeling that there's a lot of people trying to... What even killed him?
[59:43.60]Oh, the sentry?
[59:44.06]Mini-Sentry.
[59:44.58]It wasn't just a sentry, it was a gosh dang Mini-Sentry.
[59:54.54]Shoot me.
[59:54.98]Shoot me!
[59:58.58]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[60:05.53]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:11.25]Oh, come on, kill everybody.
[60:12.37]Oh, at least I got two or three people.
[60:17.82]Brass Beast.
[60:20.80]Two and two on this guy.
[60:21.70]I haven't seen this guy in a little while, this guy last.
[60:24.84]The chat is not loading for me, so if you... What the hell?
[60:30.30]What the...
[60:34.09]Well, that's one way to die.
[60:36.23]Yeah, the chat is not loading.
[60:37.33]What the hell is going on here?
[60:41.45]You chat bastard.
[60:47.33]Cat.
[60:47.83]Stop.
[60:48.35]Yelp, cat.
[60:50.25]Do I speak English?
[60:53.44]It depends on if I'm playing a game and talking.
[60:56.06]At that point, probably not.
[60:57.72]Probably speaking some other language that nobody knows.
[61:01.12]He's around for sure.
[61:05.49]I don't know how I didn't hit him with the first one.
[61:08.03]Will you be quiet, cat?
[61:09.85]You're messing with my feng shui.
[61:13.84]Oh, boy.
[61:16.02]Trying to catch him in the air.
[61:19.26]Where is that spy?
[61:20.46]Die!
[61:30.23]Die!
[61:34.74]Of course, people everywhere.
[61:39.47]Oh, walked right into it.
[61:44.47]Favorite movie is probably... Now that is a tough question, because then you have to talk about The Dark Knight, Memento, Ghostbusters.
[61:53.90]I cannot pick a favorite movie.
[61:55.92]No way.
[61:56.42]Even if I tried.
[61:59.35]Even if I really wanted to tell you, it would be difficult.
[62:06.74]Get him in the air.
[62:07.38]This guy's getting unusual.
[62:12.70]He means business.
[62:17.70]Oh, let's go!
[62:18.54]Let's rock out!
[62:19.32]I don't even care anymore.
[62:22.45]I'm just running in like an idiot.
[62:24.73]Fight Club is also an amazing one.
[62:27.47]Ghostbusters?
[62:28.11]You've never seen Ghostbusters before?
[62:31.53]If you've never seen Ghostbusters, go do it right now.
[62:36.82]Go to Netflix.
[62:37.66]I mean, is it even on Netflix?
[62:38.96]I don't even know.
[62:42.57]Eight damage.
[62:43.41]Are you kidding me?
[62:47.97]There he goes.
[62:54.77]He's still alive.
[63:00.28]Oh, if I had a shot.
[63:03.94]If I had a damn shot.
[63:11.33]There's how you shoot somebody in the face.
[63:13.76]Get crit!
[63:15.50]How come that didn't hit anybody?
[63:17.18]I didn't get a... crit with that?
[63:19.94]Actually, maybe I did.
[63:20.54]Probably just didn't show up.
[63:22.84]Two minutes left!
[63:27.89]Hello, Spy.
[63:30.41]You happen to be in the base?
[63:31.59]Red Spy in the base?
[63:33.71]Blue Spy in the base, actually.
[63:38.01]Blue Spy in the base.
[63:42.93]Make sure no rap scallions are coming up behind us.
[63:49.89]Damn it.
[63:52.85]What?
[63:53.49]How did that not hit that dude?
[63:56.89]Just barely killed him.
[63:57.93]No!
[63:59.63]Stay away from my medic.
[64:01.77]I'm trying to keep him away from you.
[64:03.97]Oh, jeez.
[64:10.05]No, I'm going to have to catch him off guard.
[64:15.04]He's alive.
[64:15.84]For sure!
[64:22.14]Aww, he was just... one's a taunt.
[64:26.10]Oh my goodness.
[64:29.81]How is he not gonna die from that?
[64:31.15]I was gonna say.
[64:36.27]Oh, get up in the air again.
[64:38.65]I'm sorry, I can't protect you!
[64:40.58]No!
[64:40.88]Leave my Spedek alone!
[64:44.16]Where is he?
[64:46.64]He's up top.
[64:47.94]Watch yourself.
[64:49.35]I don't have any... I don't have any A-blasts left.
[64:50.91]Retreat!
[64:51.69]Retreat!
[64:55.05]Crit to the face.
[64:59.45]I think we're gonna get it, guys.
[65:01.99]Let's see if any, uh... any craziness happens at the very end.
[65:07.36]Oh, don't jump.
[65:09.44]Probably be a good idea to... Oh my god.
[65:13.14]That guy came out of nowhere.
[65:15.78]Might as well sit on the point and just do this.
[65:17.72]And just airblast anyone that tries to jump up here.
[65:21.48]Nice game, guys.
[65:24.70]Good game.
[65:29.98]Oh!
[65:30.18]Alright.
[65:31.86]So I think I'm going to transition now to play some Bloons Tower defense.
[65:39.69]I'm going to play until I die.
[65:41.09]Well, hopefully I do.
[65:43.09]Ha ha.
[65:45.03]I'm going to go one more life.
[65:46.67]So if I... Next time I die.
[65:50.81]My last life.
[65:53.41]Been streaming TF2 for about an hour and... 10 minutes.
[65:57.44]Just about an hour.
[65:58.02]A full 60 minutes.
[66:03.50]Yeah, balloons is fun, man.
[66:14.99]Ten hour games by.
[66:21.45]Is Bloons 5 out?
[66:22.93]Can I play that?
[66:27.77]I've never had Bloons for my iPhone.
[66:29.30]I gotta do that.
[66:30.10]My god.
[66:30.74]Alright, so if you want to keep playing Team Fortress, the only way it's going to happen is if there's like nine medics on me.
[66:37.88]You know what?
[66:38.22]Let's do it.
[66:38.80]Let's do it.
[66:39.50]Everyone on blue, go medic.
[66:41.00]We'll see how long this lasts.
[66:44.57]If you are on blue, just go medic.
[66:48.99]And just octo-heavy me.
[66:50.99]I wonder how long I will stay alive.
[66:52.57]This is the last life.
[66:55.45]Here we go.
[66:56.05]Oh my god.
[66:58.25]Oh, this is immediately rigged.
[67:05.40]Is it even, like, possible to die?
[67:08.50]I don't even think it's possible to die.
[67:10.56]Oh my god.
[67:15.93]Unless I get backstabbed.
[67:17.27]There's no way I'm going to die.
[67:26.26]This hurts to laugh.
[67:29.14]Oh, what a bunch of nonsense.
[67:36.49]Oh my god.
[67:42.11]No, don't kill my medics.
[67:43.43]I need them.
[67:46.77]Oh no, we lost quite a few.
[67:49.72]Oh no!
[67:50.40]Oh no!
[67:56.38]Oh, I'm going to pass out, man.
[67:58.12]I just laughed too hard.
[68:01.16]Oh, my face hurts.
[68:04.24]We really... No, there's no way this is going to work.
[68:07.86]There's no way this is going to work.
[68:10.86]If this actually works, no way.
[68:13.39]No, my...
[68:14.80]My battalion.
[68:18.66]I'm going to get backstabbed.
[68:20.32]It's going to end it.
[68:21.41]The backstab's going to end it all.
[68:24.91]No, don't kill me.
[68:30.27]Oh my god, they're all going spy.
[68:32.01]They are all going spy.
[68:36.87]Everybody went spy.
[68:39.59]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:45.77]Oh!
[68:48.11]Well, you did it.
[68:50.11]And I think we won.
[68:50.83]Did we win?
[68:51.47]Did we just win the game right there?
[68:54.37]Aww.
[68:54.79]Oh, come on.
[68:55.21]We gotta win.
[68:56.63]We gotta win.
[68:57.11]I'm going again.
[68:57.61]Alright, this is it.
[69:07.84]This is it.
[69:08.60]Is it possible?
[69:09.96]Is it possible?
[69:11.76]I thought we were going to do it in one life.
[69:12.96]That would have been ridiculous.
[69:14.63]That would have just been, like, a joke.
[69:16.83]Such a total nonsense.
[69:18.01]Careful for spies.
[69:21.12]There's a spy back here somewhere.
[69:23.14]Look at all those stickies.
[69:26.70]That's alright.
[69:27.40]I'm Octo... Oh, that's it.
[69:33.14]That's it.
[69:33.56]I'm dead.
[69:35.82]I said it was going to be one life.
[69:37.58]Turned it into two.
[69:39.70]And third time's a charm, baby.
[69:41.56]Let's do it one more time.
[69:45.67]And after this, I'm going to play one round of Bloons.
[69:49.67]God.
[69:51.81]This is it.
[69:52.47]This is the real it.
[69:53.31]This is it.
[69:53.71]This is really it.
[69:54.33]If I die right here, I am rage quitting.
[70:01.95]Careful.
[70:02.42]I'm not supposed to keep my back turned.
[70:04.18]Oh, there's definitely somebody hiding in this room.
[70:13.88]This is chaos.
[70:14.98]This is absolute total chaos.
[70:17.66]Go, come on, come on, let's go!
[70:19.10]Let's go, let's go!
[70:20.07]Jump down, all the medics jump down.
[70:21.71]Watch out for the spy medic, there's a spy medic.
[70:24.25]Oh my god, he's killing everyone.
[70:27.59]Oh my god.
[70:28.97]He's killing, oh my god, they're all spies!
[70:32.44]Oh my god, how many people?
[70:38.88]How many of those medics were actually spies is the real question.
[70:43.51]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[70:46.75]Oh, I didn't get it in three.
[70:49.65]Oh, meow yourself, cat.
[70:52.95]Alright, guys.
[70:54.14]Oh, my goodness.
[70:55.80]My throat hurts from just, like, cackling for the last ten minutes.
[71:00.64]This time, because I'm gonna give this a little bit of time, I want to really get a tactic down.
[71:06.62]Because usually I end the stream with this, and I'm probably gonna end the stream with this as well.
[71:11.02]But I want to get...
[71:13.61]a tactic down.
[71:15.01]A real tactic.
[71:17.87]So, let's see.
[71:23.31]So, the actual tactic is you're supposed to do... Somebody gave me a tactic before.
[71:30.41]And they said you have to do... You have to raise your right leg, and then raise your left leg, but you don't raise the calf.
[71:37.91]Like that.
[71:38.71]Like that.
[71:39.59]Like that.
[71:40.45]Oh my god, come on.
[71:42.39]This is the first time I've ever stepped more than two steps in this game.
[71:47.54]So the goal tonight, guys, is... What the hell?
[71:53.10]What was that?
[71:54.82]The goal tonight is 50 meters.
[71:58.32]I'm gonna do it.
[71:59.93]I'm gonna get to 50.
[72:01.55]You don't believe me?
[72:02.45]Just watch.
[72:04.33]50 meters.
[72:05.05]Right now.
[72:06.41]Once I get to 50, I can end the stream.
[72:10.49]50 meters.
[72:10.85]Come on.
[72:12.24]Come on.
[72:13.00]Slug your way over there, you bastard.
[72:15.26]50 meters.
[72:15.64]We're doing it.
[72:16.24]I'm doing it.
[72:17.68]I don't care if it takes me till 8 in the morning.
[72:20.42]I'm doing 50 meters.
[72:22.58]Or at least 40.
[72:23.62]We'll say 40.
[72:24.46]At least 40 meters.
[72:25.73]Or... I have... Oh my god!
[72:31.91]I'm... Okay.
[72:32.65]We're good.
[72:33.19]We're good.
[72:34.53]Gotta get to at least 40.
[72:36.79]Here we go, baby.
[72:37.59]Come on.
[72:38.13]We're doing the niche.
[72:38.99]We're doing the niche ride.
[72:41.95]We're doing the knee slug.
[72:44.11]Imagine how bad that would hurt.
[72:46.41]Can you imagine how awful that would hurt?
[72:49.75]I seem to be stuck here.
[72:51.89]I'm stuck here.
[72:53.61]Oh my god.
[72:55.09]There we go.
[72:55.85]There we go.
[72:57.27]There we go.
[72:57.81]Come on.
[72:58.63]Stay with it.
[72:59.19]Stay with it now.
[73:00.65]Gotta get to 30 or 40.
[73:02.91]Oh my god.
[73:03.61]This is the best I've ever done.
[73:07.06]Alright.
[73:07.40]Alright.
[73:07.66]Slow down.
[73:08.16]Slow down a little.
[73:09.78]Slow down a little.
[73:10.46]We're gonna hit 30.
[73:13.99]Oh my god!
[73:16.37]Oh my god.
[73:18.35]Slug, slug, slug, slug, slug, slug, slug.
[73:30.34]Oh, when I say 40, when I say 30 or 40.
[73:33.66]Let's try and get it again.
[73:34.88]Oh god damn it, I'm so mad right now.
[73:39.36]I can't believe it.
[73:41.38]I can't believe it.
[73:43.22]I am so, so mad right now.
[73:48.86]Slug, slug, slug, slug, slug.
[73:52.13]I'm going to get to 40 with the slug.
[73:54.57]Just so you see.
[73:56.73]So now that we've got a little slug going here, let's talk about a story.
[74:00.63]So one time, there was a slug named Jerma.
[74:04.81]And the slug was... I can't even talk because I'm balancing on one foot.
[74:11.75]Alright, transition here.
[74:18.71]No!
[74:20.99]Alright, 30 plus 10 is 40.
[74:23.79]I did it.
[74:24.23]I just gotta get down.
[74:29.03]I gotta get down on, like, the ground.
[74:30.47]I gotta have this, like... I gotta get... I had it down the first time, and you know what?
[74:34.85]I screwed it all up.
[74:37.13]30 plus 10 is 40.
[74:38.12]I did it.
[74:39.20]There we go.
[74:43.50]There we go.
[74:46.68]Nice workout I'm doing here, huh?
[74:52.18]Slug, slug, slug, slug, slug, slug, slug.
[74:56.63]Alright, we're at 10.
[74:58.55]I've made it to a combined 50 meters.
[75:02.31]Can I make it to 40 doing this?
[75:07.45]I don't think it's going to happen.
[75:08.61]I really don't think it's going to happen.
[75:13.63]Oh, don't lose it.
[75:18.38]Alright, 30 plus 10 plus 13 is more than 50.
[75:20.94]I did it!
[75:21.70]I made it!
[75:29.07]Apparently, I can walk up sideways.
[75:36.96]There we go.
[75:37.86]Just gotta keep this rhythm.
[75:38.68]I'm gonna keep the rhythm.
[75:39.92]Boom, den, den, den, den, den.
[75:42.36]Slug, slug, we're gonna slug, slug.
[75:45.03]Everybody's gotta slug, we're gonna slug, slug.
[75:48.95]Every day you gotta slug till it's due, till the end of May.
[75:52.83]You gotta slug, slug.
[75:54.99]The music helps.
[75:55.41]The music helps.
[75:56.17]The music helps.
[76:14.66]Why did I stop singing?
[76:15.62]The music helped!
[76:16.34]Let's do it again.
[76:18.22]This is the last time.
[76:19.26]Here we go.
[76:28.20]We got a slug here.
[76:29.80]I've never seen such a slug.
[76:41.90]In my entire life.
[76:45.22]When you slug, you gotta slug.
[76:46.88]When you go, you go.
[76:48.20]You gotta get on the track and be super slow.
[76:51.16]You got it.
[76:55.61]The music, the music.
[76:58.93]Never, never don't slug.
[77:03.00]Never stop slugging till you get to the end of town.
[77:14.31]Oh, I think that was a combined over 100 meters.
[77:20.25]Well, there we go.
[77:23.72]That's going to be it.
[77:27.40]I've drained all my energy with this co-op.
[77:32.20]At least I got 30 meters.
[77:34.02]I said 30 or 40 in one try.
[77:35.76]Actually, I said 40 or 50, but I'm going to change my words.
[77:38.58]I'm going to be like a politician and say, well, I actually said 30 or 40.
[77:43.05]But yeah, that was fun.
[77:44.69]That was fun.
[77:46.37]So, everybody, thank you so much for coming.
[77:49.40]This is the end of the stream.
[77:51.78]Ugh, I need to go drink some tea.
[77:53.62]My throat is a little dry and itchy.
[77:57.96]But anyways, guys, thank you so, so much for coming.
[78:01.36]All you guys that stuck around, it means a lot.
[78:04.08]You guys rock.
[78:06.10]So, yeah.
[78:06.88]Stay tuned.
[78:07.78]I'm going to... This will all be uploaded to YouTube.
[78:09.44]At least this part.
[78:10.64]I'll make sure to get the TF2 and the... At least the QWOP part uploaded to YouTube.
[78:14.78]So... Be on the lookout for that.
[78:19.04]I'll... Probably tomorrow.
[78:21.27]Tomorrow in the afternoon, I would assume.
[78:24.39]But the chat... I cannot... The chat just died for me right at the end here.
[78:28.11]So, I'm sorry if I can't see anything that you guys are saying.
[78:30.35]But... Thank you so much, guys.
[78:32.59]And I'll catch you guys all later.
[78:33.75]It's a take...
[78:35.56]care, everybody.
[78:38.16]Peace.
