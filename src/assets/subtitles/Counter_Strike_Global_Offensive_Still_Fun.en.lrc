[00:05.55]You're as drunk as me.
[00:10.76]I love Shibby the Lobby Troll.
[00:14.68]It's like one of my favorite things.
[00:27.60]Shibby the Lobby Troll.
[00:28.38]I just love the sound of scoping in with a gun.
[00:31.52]Just, like, click.
[00:34.06]So good.
[00:36.67]Where's all the bad guys?
[00:39.01]I'm down the lower left tunnel, I see one.
[00:42.03]Why do our characters have backpacks now?
[00:43.70]This is daisy.
[00:48.06]Whoa!
[00:49.50]I didn't know that guy was here.
[00:50.52]Where was he?
[00:51.54]He's right in the left staircase.
[00:53.46]Down the bottom.
[00:54.06]Careful, there's two there.
[00:56.52]Like, right where you are should be, there's like two on the top, and then there's gonna be one down the bottom.
[01:00.82]Unless he moved.
[01:02.94]Yeah, I think I see him.
[01:05.00]But I'm bad.
[01:06.38]I'll lead the target.
[01:08.92]Oh, Shibby2142 here, live with Shibby2142, aiming with the Scout Sniper.
[01:13.45]Oh, gosh!
[01:16.33]That was actually through an object.
[01:18.87]You can see the kill tag top right.
[01:22.79]This guy Ray is doing work.
[01:31.45]Is that a guy?
[01:32.59]Is that a guy?
[01:34.07]Player, player, player, player.
[01:35.43]Oh, Etalyx is still going.
[01:38.51]We're now on board with Etalyx.
[01:40.45]Looks like there's a ton of weaponry in front of them.
[01:42.53]I don't hear flies, though.
[01:44.15]Not sure what's going on.
[01:44.83]We got enemies.
[01:45.55]That's a friendly.
[01:46.33]Hey, bro.
[01:47.45]He tried to snipe me.
[01:48.80]What is this?
[01:50.70]I could third person cheat a little bit here.
[01:53.06]He might be in B site.
[01:54.16]Cough, cough, cough, cough.
[01:56.92]And we're going to work our way around to the B site.
[01:59.92]Cough, cough, cough, cough.
[02:03.45]Etalyx, he looks left, he looks right, he sees the guy.
[02:05.63]How does he not see him in the right peripheral?
[02:07.69]He's shooting his weak.
[02:08.33]Etalyx.
[02:09.69]Oh, he misses.
[02:10.43]Etalyx is going in really hard right now.
[02:12.15]He's going with the pistol.
[02:14.09]Doesn't give up.
[02:15.01]Oh, he drops him, but he has to defuse the bomb.
[02:16.74]Let's see if he can find it.
[02:17.78]This looks like it's going to be an easy win for Etalyx.
[02:21.04]Absolutely doing work.
[02:23.72]as a counter-terrorist.
[02:25.46]Hold on, pull out the knife and start slashing him, just so people know you're a boss.
[02:28.62]Yep, yep, show off that sensitivity, Etalyx.
[02:31.60]Doing work.
[02:34.11]Hello, dissenters, my name is Etalyx, and I am here today with some Counter- Global Offensive to show you.
[02:40.83]And I wanted to just take a look at this game because I recently pre-purchased it, and by pre-purchasing it, you do get into the beta now, so what that means is instant access as soon as you pre-purchase it,
[02:51.54]And the game does in fact release on August the 21st.
[02:55.22]So just a few days from now actually.
[02:57.24]And I believe it's coming out at a price point of about $15.
[03:00.00]But if you buy it now, it does give you like $1.50 off something, somewhere around there.
[03:05.02]And I used to play Counter-Strike Source.
[03:06.90]I was never really into 1.6.
[03:08.76]That was before my time of PC gaming.
[03:11.66]And I, like I said, I did play some swords, but not extensively.
[03:14.38]I would not consider myself a pro or a veteran.
[03:17.32]Just enough to kind of know how it works, know that I need to buy, you know, Kevlar and, you know, a defuse kit as a counter-terrorist separately.
[03:25.18]Things like that.
[03:25.85]Just the bare necessities.
[03:27.53]And this is not going to be any kind of tutorial on how to play.
[03:29.69]I just want to talk about the game itself and pose a few questions to you guys so that I can see what you think.
[03:35.45]Because I'm interested to know, you know, the opinion of those of you who have played CS 1.6 and who were much better at CS Source than I was.
[03:44.12]I was one of those guys that just played on the custom maps primarily.
[03:46.90]I never really, you know, played very well on the regular...
[03:50.84]you know, rescue the hostages or plant the bomb.
[03:54.26]Never was really any good on those, so I stuck to Ice World and the custom maps.
[03:59.23]My favorite custom map was probably the McDonald's custom map.
[04:03.41]I don't know why, I don't know why, but that was probably my favorite one.
[04:06.95]And if those of you who have played that, please let me know if someone's going to make it for this particular Counter-Strike go or not, because I'm really looking forward to the custom maps in Counter-Strike, but I kind of digress.
[04:18.19]What I like so far about Counter-Strike
[04:20.69]Honestly is the sound effects like the sound effects are what really keep me coming back And that is the first time I think I've ever said that about a video game Everything is just so crisp everything is just so clean I have I have this kind of Twitch that I do whenever I spawn and I just mash the keys just to hear the sound effects just go like 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 just to hear all of the different sound effects for the knife and the pistol and the gun and
[04:44.00]I can't explain it.
[04:44.80]It's some kind of strange addiction.
[04:47.12]But I'm really having fun with this game.
[04:48.90]It did take a little bit to pick up on.
[04:50.80]It did take a number of rounds of just getting completely stomped in order to start breaking even and eventually start going positive.
[04:57.79]And I've gotten to the point where I can kind of comfortably...
[05:00.18]Play the game without getting completely trashed.
[05:02.44]I do want to talk about my favorite weapon, which is what I am using for the majority of these clips here, and that is this sawed-off shotgun, because I am playing terrorists most of the time, but they do have a shotgun counterpart on the counter-terrorist side, I just can't quite remember the name of it.
[05:16.44]This shotgun is extremely powerful.
[05:18.76]It's a one-hit kill if you're close enough to the target, and some might argue that it is overpowered, and I would not argue with you there.
[05:26.23]If you get the shot at a pretty close range, you're gonna tear the guy up as if you were using an AWP or something like that.
[05:32.59]But from a mid-range to a long distance, obviously the shotgun is completely useless, as you're gonna see here, just firing a random shot.
[05:38.88]Probably did no damage, probably didn't even connect.
[05:41.00]Pull out the deagle and managed to finish the guy off.
[05:43.32]I love this little combo right here.
[05:45.09]Having the sawed-off shotgun and the desert eagle to finish guys off from a medium to longer range distance.
[05:50.59]Yes, the desert eagle only has seven shots, but they are powerful shots.
[05:54.33]They can make quick work of any enemy from a medium distance.
[05:58.05]I also like carrying a grenade on me.
[05:59.92]I've never killed anyone with a grenade.
[06:01.74]I don't know why I continue to buy them, but it seems like a good distraction to kind of throw them off their groove.
[06:06.68]If you know someone's in the distance, like down a hallway per se, maybe you toss a grenade down there just to kind of shake him up a little bit.
[06:12.56]I tend to charge in right after that because with the shotgun, you do want to be up close and personal.
[06:17.77]But I'm not going to pretend to be some kind of professional here.
[06:20.11]This is just my favorite gun, and I wanted to tell you how much I love my sawed-off shotgun.
[06:24.61]I just...
[06:25.27]That ragdoll animation.
[06:27.23]I just love popping them up in the air and just watching them.
[06:30.25]Okay, this is kind of sounding a little sadistic, so I'm going to stop.
[06:33.75]I'm going a little bit crazy here.
[06:35.74]Counter-Strike Go is a game that I am looking forward to playing upon release, especially as more and more people get into the game.
[06:41.48]More people that have to learn how to play from me.
[06:44.52]Okay, sadistic once again.
[06:45.92]I've got to stop being like this.
[06:48.70]Positive gaming.
[06:50.16]If you have never played Counter-Strike, should you buy CS:GO?
[06:54.12]I would say this is probably the best place to start.
[06:57.13]If you're interested in this kind of a game, but a little bit more of a competitive scenario, I'm playing the 5v5 competitive mode right now.
[07:03.43]I would recommend not starting off in casual.
[07:06.09]That's just my personal opinion, and that is because I don't think 10v10 works at all in Counter-Strike.
[07:11.51]But the opinions that I wanted to know from those of you who have played Counter-Strike 1.6 and Source and who are veterans that I mentioned previously...
[07:18.08]What do you think about Global Offensive in general as compared to especially 1.6 and Source?
[07:23.36]I understand that there is a lot of people upset about some of the changes that have been made, some of the things that may have been taken away, but I can't honestly say I know what those things are.
[07:32.55]So if you could enlighten me, tell me what is the difference between Global Offensive and Source slash 1.6?
[07:38.75]what makes it worse in your opinion, or maybe what makes it better.
[07:41.97]For me, what makes it better is just the fact that it is an updated game, and more people are going to be playing it because it's open to a new audience.
[07:49.93]Whereas with Source, I'm playing against the same old vets who have been playing for years now, and they're just going to completely tear me up every single time I play, so I enjoy having a little bit more of an even playing field so that I can learn how to play and become better.
[08:02.78]So far, having a ton of fun with this.
[08:04.22]Would definitely recommend that you at least check it out and consider buying it.
[08:07.64]It is very cheap.
[08:09.02]But it is definitely not a game for everyone because of the sheer difficulty alone.
[08:13.14]Anyways, guys, just wanted to show you some quick clips of Catastrophe Global Offensive.
[08:16.74]If you enjoyed this gameplay, if you want to see some more game modes, maybe some gun game, or, excuse me, I believe it is called Arms Race now, so that, I will call it by its official name.
[08:25.34]Maybe you want to see some of that gameplay.
[08:26.88]If you want to see more live commentary, let me know that too.
[08:29.74]Do you like the new format where I kind of just throw in some post commentary and some live commentary in the same video?
[08:34.10]Because it seems to be kind of working out pretty well for me.
[08:36.74]I really enjoy the new format.
[08:39.02]I want to thank you guys very much for watching and I hope to see you again.
[08:43.27]My name is Etalyx and I will see you next time.
