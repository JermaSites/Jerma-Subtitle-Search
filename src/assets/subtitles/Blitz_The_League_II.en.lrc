[00:01.51]Hello, hello, hello.
[00:02.71]Hi.
[00:04.29]Yes, we're here.
[00:07.72]Well, that was what we'd like to call an adventure.
[00:15.60]So, for those of you that don't know, I had a plan today.
[00:20.36]I was thinking of starting the Ace Attorney.
[00:25.01]See, no, I'm not going to wait.
[00:25.73]I'm going to wait.
[00:26.31]I'm going to wait.
[00:27.65]Because there are people probably coming in.
[00:31.19]Do you remember watching the Super Bowl?
[00:32.51]So am I!
[00:34.47]There's a long list of what's going on today.
[00:37.47]First of all, free nothing.
[00:39.87]Patriots just scored.
[00:44.88]I don't have a TV.
[00:46.56]I don't have cable that can watch this game.
[00:50.06]And I'm not watching it right now live.
[00:52.26]I'm getting the, like, website updates on what happened.
[01:03.33]That's bad.
[01:05.91]I forgot today was the Super Bowl, okay?
[01:10.57]I had, I did not know this.
[01:14.27]Last night, late last night, when we were like, oh yeah, tomorrow we're gonna do, uh, Ace Attorney!
[01:19.61]That sounds like a good idea.
[01:20.91]Let's do Ace Attorney tomorrow, during the Super Bowl.
[01:23.27]I was like, ah, I woke up this morning.
[01:27.87]And two things happened.
[01:29.45]First thing that happened is the Super Bowl is today.
[01:31.47]Do you know how I knew that?
[01:33.87]Because my entire family sent me messages telling me how excited they are.
[01:40.08]And I was like, what are they excited for?
[01:41.10]I was like, I have like 40 messages from my family.
[01:45.50]They're all dressed in Patriots.
[01:48.04]This is all the Super Bowl is today.
[01:49.72]And I forgot.
[01:52.06]So the plan was going to play Ace Attorney.
[01:55.53]But, you know, that's just the way it is.
[01:58.70]Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright.
[02:01.66]And that didn't turn out the way that I wanted to for two reasons.
[02:04.24]One, yes, Super Bowl.
[02:06.14]And I wanted to pay attention to it because the Patriots are in it.
[02:08.92]That's my team.
[02:11.14]You know, until the Raiders get here, that's my team.
[02:13.80]Problem two, Ace Attorney, I bought them all on the iPad.
[02:19.56]So iPad comes in.
[02:21.79]Sick.
[02:22.71]There's my iPad.
[02:23.52]Got a crack in it, but it still works.
[02:25.52]My splitter.
[02:26.98]Okay, yeah, I packed that one.
[02:28.64]Remember I packed that one.
[02:30.36]I don't have the audio splitter.
[02:32.74]So I couldn't capture the audio from my iPad.
[02:37.27]Somehow it got lost in the move.
[02:39.01]Got lost in the mail.
[02:42.47]Thought about potentially emulating...
[02:45.25]Like, alright, I bought them all, I have them all on iPad.
[02:48.49]Let's just, whatever.
[02:49.63]Like, this idea came out last night, right?
[02:51.49]Like, Ace Attorney, I didn't really plan that much on it.
[02:54.50]It was like, last night I bought them, and like, I'm going to try it this morning, and you see how it went.
[03:00.18]The emulators, they're all removed from the internet.
[03:08.10]At least on a couple of the places that I thought.
[03:10.20]Because, you know, I own the titles maybe out of desperation.
[03:14.80]I've bought them, I own them.
[03:19.26]And then I heard that there's going to be a PC remaster of Ace Attorney coming out very soon.
[03:26.91]So I'm sitting here going, oh god damn it, what the fuck?
[03:31.47]When are those coming out?
[03:36.07]So, what I've decided to do today is I still own Ace Attorney and I can still get it to work.
[03:41.26]I have to get a new audio splitter.
[03:44.80]Here's an emu... No, I don't want to talk about emulators.
[03:48.64]No emulation.
[03:49.68]Not yet.
[03:50.56]I'm not talking about that yet.
[03:53.72]So.
[03:55.72]What I've decided to do is because Super Bowl's today.
[03:58.92]I went through... I jumped through a bunch of hoops.
[04:01.62]And I was able to get this.
[04:08.54]Well, hold on.
[04:09.04]There's like a logo on here.
[04:12.78]I don't want like a...
[04:17.27]There's like two logos on here.
[04:26.55]Alright, well, you know what?
[04:33.84]We'll just show the back.
[04:35.32]No, I'm just going to go like this.
[04:37.55]So this is what I was able to get today.
[04:39.46]Let's rewind.
[04:40.20]Okay.
[04:41.10]So after all, I was gonna play Ace Attorney.
[04:44.72]And I jumped through a bunch of hoops.
[04:47.82]And I was able to get this.
[04:48.76]That is Blitz the League 2.
[04:54.82]One of my favorite games of all time on the old generation console.
[05:00.46]So you're probably asking yourself, I mean, it is Patriots Day, right?
[05:04.56]It is like the Patriots are, like, gone.
[05:06.69]So I made sure to get my Patriots clothes on today.
[05:10.57]Hey, can you tell I knew it was the fucking goddamn Super Bowl?
[05:13.77]10% of my wardrobe, guys!
[05:25.40]Do you understand?
[05:29.78]Go Patriots!
[05:37.18]It's desynced?
[05:38.04]It shouldn't be.
[05:38.64]What?
[05:42.53]You gonna desync me?
[05:44.27]Oh, it is desynced.
[05:45.31]What a piece of crap.
[05:47.85]Hold on.
[05:52.23]But, yeah.
[05:53.10]Blitz the League 2.
[05:54.74]And even Blitz the League, if you guys didn't know.
[05:58.60]This is where Mortal Kombat got their horrible break-the-person's-neck-close-up-blood-comes-out-of-their-mouth animations.
[06:08.89]This is not a regular football game by a long shot.
[06:14.16]This is the game where all those crazy, brutal things that happen in Mortal Kombat, this is where they came from.
[06:20.78]Same company.
[06:23.02]This game is fucking hilarious.
[06:24.60]It's amazing.
[06:25.82]And I got it today.
[06:27.78]I got this today.
[06:28.82]I activated Jack's powers and I got, well, I had some help.
[06:35.04]How do I put this in?
[06:38.88]I don't believe you.
[06:39.48]Isn't Mortal Kombat older?
[06:42.15]Mortal Kombat's zoom in You'll see what I'm talking about you once I like punch a guy in the nuts and like his balls explode like that I'm not I'm just saying that that happens in this game because it does you understand How do I open this I'm not used to this place This is all very quick.
[07:05.33]We got this set up immediately.
[07:08.09]I
[07:09.98]Who scored?
[07:10.88]Nobody?
[07:11.24]It's still 3-0.
[07:13.40]I don't know how to put the disc inside of this PlayStation.
[07:15.72]I'm not kidding.
[07:16.68]This is bad.
[07:18.48]How do I open this?
[07:19.70]Does this have discs?
[07:25.54]Anybody know how to do this?
[07:32.72]Um...
[07:42.75]It's on the left.
[07:44.89]Just push it in.
[07:47.03]It's not on the left.
[07:50.13]Wait a minute, hold on.
[07:51.05]Somebody help me.
[07:51.71]Hold on, I gotta move some stuff.
[08:04.27]Is there a disk in there?
[08:05.37]No, there's no disk in there already.
[08:12.09]For a second, I thought stupid invaders was in here.

[08:48.19]How do I- How the fuck do I put a disc in here?
[08:52.44]Where does it go?
[08:56.50]There's nothing here.
[08:57.96]There's nothing there.
[09:04.89]Slide it.
[09:17.80]I've never seen a PlayStation like that.
[09:22.14]A slide the top open?
[09:23.86]No way.
[09:31.18]Slide it open.

[10:52.98]Oh, shit.
[11:05.18]I forgot.
[11:07.06]Where's this camera even pointing?
[11:12.87]This camera sucks.
[11:16.55]You know who's got a real monopoly on the video camera industry?
[11:21.61]Logitech.
[11:23.86]They are... They are the Kleenex of cameras.
[11:29.32]It's bullshit.
[11:32.34]There's like four cameras.
[11:35.63]Stalling?
[11:36.39]No, I got 17%.
[11:37.19]I don't want you guys to know what the percentage is.
[11:42.59]Just use a cam link and a real camera.
[11:46.89]I don't wanna, like, hook up a DSLR up here.
[11:50.79]I don't- I don't- Do you guys think I- What, you think I want you to see my face in, like, 4K?
[11:57.87]You think sometimes I look fucked up now?
[12:02.12]Imagine what I would look like in... every pore, every pocket of my face being shown?
[12:10.08]No, you're not getting the Ren and Stimpy close-up camera on my face.
[12:12.68]I'm sorry, guys.
[12:15.03]What are we at?
[12:19.45]31.
[12:24.56]Who has the ball?
[12:25.84]I can't believe I forgot the fucking Super Bowl was today.
[12:31.12]And it was a perfect opportunity.
[12:33.58]I streamed the last two days in a row.
[12:34.60]This is three days in a row, right?
[12:36.10]I was going to, oh, maybe I'll take today off.
[12:38.49]I would have probably watched the Super Bowl.
[12:41.53]But I can't even watch the Super Bowl, so uneven sideburns.
[12:45.03]That's not true.
[12:45.63]I tried as hard as I could in the morning to shape them.
[12:48.57]See, look, one, two, right in the right spot.
[12:54.24]I may have butchered this side a little.
[13:00.52]They're not uneven.
[13:01.38]They're just unorganized.
[13:03.70]There's a difference.
[13:07.06]They're actually uneven.
[13:07.98]No, they're just unorganized.
[13:12.33]They're uneven as fuck.
[13:13.39]No, they're not.
[13:14.11]They just don't look right.
[13:16.79]Because I need a haircut.
[13:17.66]And when I get a haircut, they just take them out.
[13:21.14]Speaking of haircuts, I need to get one of those, too.
[13:25.40]They actually are uneven.
[13:29.97]I can't... I can't...
[13:34.24]The camera's right here, you guys are right here, video game is here, OBS preview is over here right now.
[13:40.30]I can't, there's no way I can fucking do this.
[13:42.37]I'd have to go into the bathroom.
[13:49.19]Cut your own hair.
[13:52.72]What's the percentage? 65.
[14:01.10]He shouldn't, I don't know, I think it might have something, you know what I think it is?
[14:05.02]So I don't know about you guys, but I have like an uneven face.
[14:08.68]So when I'm like turning and looking this way, going like this, my eyes are in a different, this eye is not in the right position.
[14:14.55]It's like squished in.
[14:16.37]Then my nose is like bigger on this side.
[14:18.61]So when I'm like shaving over here, I'm like blocking my view.
[14:21.07]When I'm shaving over here, I have like two different viewpoints because my face is uneven.
[14:31.26]Your face is fucked up.
[14:38.98]Yeah?
[14:40.13]So?
[14:45.55]Your face is fucked.
[14:50.61]No one's face is completely even.
[14:53.61]Thank you, Dr. Phil.
[14:56.31]Wait, second quarter?
[14:57.13]When is the Super Bowl halftime show?
[14:59.45]Is that free?
[15:01.96]Is it free to see, to watch the halftime show?
[15:08.12]Don't, doesn't every TV channel all at the same time turn on the halftime show?
[15:12.36]I thought that was like legally what happens.
[15:15.50]Like you're in the middle of Law and Order or something and it's just like, you're on the right stuff, baby, I was born, it just goes to it, right?
[15:22.57]Every network.
[15:29.69]Installation complete.
[15:30.49]Please quit the game through the PS button and restart Blitz League 2.
[15:33.16]You got it.
[15:33.54]I hope there's enough battery in this.
[15:39.08]Wait, what am I doing?
[15:39.80]Okay, quit game.
[15:44.24]Yes.
[15:48.06]It's free on the CBS website, but I'll go to jail if I play that, right?
[15:51.53]On stream.
[15:52.85]You can't do that on stream.
[15:55.31]That's the quickest way to go to jail.
[15:58.72]Look at those pores.
[16:02.62]Shut up.
[16:06.96]Any score?
[16:07.86]Who has the ball?
[16:09.44]Patriots have the ball.
[16:11.02]It's 3-0.
[16:11.24]Did they get a field goal?
[16:12.80]I need play-by-play from you guys.
[16:18.44]High Definition HD Gaming.
[16:21.70]Here we go.
[16:22.80]I'm so excited.
[16:23.57]This game is amazing.
[16:26.33]Touchdown?
[16:29.86]Can you get 100% of the trophies for me?
[16:35.10]Blitz the League 2, not rated.
[16:36.94]Interactions not rated by the ESRB.
[16:39.81]So they're talking about when guys get like punched in the balls and they explode.
[16:42.65]That's what they're talking about.
[16:44.01]They can't rate that.
[16:51.50]By the way, there's no actual NFL teams in this game.
[16:55.30]It's like the Boston...
[16:57.62]Brewhouse it's like the Cincinnati Steelers there's no actual license teams.
[17:07.69]I Can't wait to play this.
[17:08.57]Okay, so let's go ahead We're probably gonna get this whole thing claimed from the we probably need to turn that off Yeah, we have to turn this we have to turn this off
[17:25.71]I'm sorry, guys.
[17:26.66]But, like, the whole VOD's gonna get muted.
[17:28.52]The rest of this is fine.
[17:34.68]Uh, difficulty, uh, yeah, no vibration.
[17:36.96]Get that out of here.
[17:38.28]Video brightness is fine.
[17:39.76]I don't remember exactly how to play, but I know some things.
[17:48.49]We can do training camp.
[17:50.69]No, I gotta do the Super Bowl right now.
[17:52.61]It's going on right now.
[17:55.61]No, training camp.
[17:59.85]Receiving, defense.
[18:01.61]Yeah, you have to like stick syringes in your players and stuff.
[18:06.49]Alright, we're gonna do watch and learn how to be a pro.
[18:09.51]Rushing, it's a game of inches.
[18:11.78]Let's just, let's just, I gotta remind my brain.
[18:17.08]You got like three hours, that shit's gonna go on forever.
[18:23.06]No, dude, it's already almost half time.
[18:25.87]This stream can only be as long as the Super Bowl.
[18:28.99]And then I gotta get off all my Super Bowl Patriots gear and turn the stream off.
[18:33.64]It won't look right.
[18:35.90]Alright Superstar, you look ready to go.
[18:38.12]This should be easy enough.
[18:39.20]Just take the hand off and bang out a few yards.
[18:41.54]Press X to hike the ball and gain 10 yards.
[18:47.67]That's a first down.
[18:49.69]That is the way to execute.
[18:50.95]I think people are going to come to the stream and not understand.
[18:53.89]Now show me the power.
[18:55.09]Power move.
[18:55.43]Knock the first chump that gets in your way flat on his ass.
[18:57.74]How do you do a power move?
[19:03.28]And that's what we call a touchdown.
[19:04.76]Good job.
[19:05.28]This game is so good.
[19:06.38]You had some sweet moves back in college, but you're in the league now.
[19:09.66]Evade.
[19:10.26]Let's see if you can juke the pros.
[19:16.16]Looking good.
[19:16.88]Don't let up now.
[19:19.80]I'm so sad they didn't make a new one.
[19:22.54]So that's a freestyle evade.
[19:24.94]So right stick is... Just wait.
[19:35.70]Just wait.
[19:37.34]It doesn't matter.
[19:37.84]I don't know anything about football.
[19:39.28]All I know is the Patriots are good.
[19:40.60]Tom Brady's cool.
[19:41.74]Tom Brady win.
[19:43.02]Rings.
[19:43.38]That's all I know.
[19:44.05]I don't know anything else.
[19:46.26]I know first down means that they get to play it again, right?
[19:49.84]It's like getting, it's like re-spins.
[19:52.82]I just made a casino reference.
[19:55.18]Why did I do that?
[19:56.81]I don't even like the casino.
[19:58.05]The casino sucks.
[20:00.35]Okay.
[20:03.21]How do I do that?
[20:07.77]First down.
[20:11.22]Okay, hold down L2 to enter clash mode and use evade or power to make a clash move.
[20:18.78]This is what we're talking about here.
[20:23.29]Yep, see, I can slow down time and shit.
[20:25.35]Each clash icon adds a pip to your unleash meter.
[20:29.65]Finish filling your unleash meter by performing a two-move combo in clash.
[20:41.19]There's one.
[20:41.65]There's two.
[20:45.53]There's three.
[20:46.69]Look at the dumb shit you can do.
[20:48.97]So now I can break somebody's neck.
[20:50.29]This is it.
[20:50.87]The sponsors are watching.
[20:52.17]Show them that you are worth every damn penny.
[20:55.59]Get out there and unleash on the first offender that gets in your way.
[20:58.71]Score a rushing touchdown and then enter the following code.
[21:00.99]XXXCircle.
[21:06.93]I got dove all the way across the fucking map.
[21:22.96]What's the code?
[21:28.94]I told you, that's nothing.
[21:30.32]Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[21:32.94]What's up?
[21:34.84]Oh, God, this is over.
[21:35.81]Outstanding.
[21:36.57]I want five more just like that.
[21:43.60]Landed on his back very, very... It was like pillows.
[21:47.98]He had other issues going on.
[21:49.28]I didn't do that.
[21:49.88]Alright, let's do some passing training.
[21:58.68]If I jumped as high as I could and landed directly on my back as flat as I could, that wouldn't happen to me.
[22:05.26]My stomach wouldn't explode.
[22:13.05]Yeah, it's so fun to... Oh, I love it.
[22:17.44]Throw to receiver.
[22:18.98]Tap as a lob.
[22:19.74]Hold it down for a bullet.
[22:24.84]That's not bad.
[22:25.68]He knows what he's doing.
[22:26.30]Clash after your quarterback evade blitzes.
[22:29.52]Burn it by gaining yards and scoring on offense.
[22:30.92]Yeah.
[22:31.06]Gain 30 yards to fill part of the clash meter.
[22:48.73]This sounds like young Germo.
[22:49.81]I am young.
[22:50.27]Press L2 to enter clash.
[22:51.23]When defenders are in range, arrows will appear.
[22:52.61]Move the right stick towards an arrow to evade.
[22:54.39]Oh, that sounds like young you.
[23:17.44]That was weak sauce, and you know it.
[23:19.34]Give me something better, something spicy.
[23:22.96]Yo, he sounds like Young.
[23:28.85]That was weak sauce, and you know it.
[23:30.75]Give me something better, something spicy.
[23:32.57]This is John Travolta.
[23:34.75]No, um, what's his name?
[23:36.37]There it is.
[23:37.49]There, I got him.
[23:44.34]was just what I was looking for not John what's his name John cusack you've got the d pissed off now and they're coming for you alright you're gonna have to be unleashed this time and move the right stick toward and towards an arrow when a defender's in range uh maybe you should try out for basketball I think I'm gonna snap this guy's neck when you get unleashed that's how you do the horrible this isn't college anymore kid you have to produce
[24:18.50]I know you have it in you show me what you've got towards the towards the rusher, right?
[24:26.26]This isn't college anymore kid you have to produce You're not even gonna make the practice squad at this rate How the fuck do I do that
[24:47.02]I mean, it's popping up at a really strange time.
[24:52.16]It's Jay Moore.
[24:53.16]Who did I say?
[24:53.84]I said somebody completely wrong.
[24:59.29]Who did I say this was?
[25:01.17]The arrow?
[25:01.61]Yeah, I gotta wait for the arrow, but it's like, it pops up in a tenth of a second.
[25:04.27]I gotta go towards the arrow.
[25:10.40]I hit him so hard that I electrocuted his brain.
[25:17.00]I didn't get tackled.
[25:18.18]Alright, square passing touchdown.
[25:24.54]Get in that end zone!
[25:27.76]Oh shit, I have to catch it.
[25:33.05]What?
[25:33.59]Oh, I didn't do the code.
[25:34.39]I got tackled.
[25:35.55]Square, square, triangle, triangle.
[25:44.24]That's a touchdown though.
[25:54.48]Alright, square squared.
[25:55.26]Why am I doing this to my own teammate?
[26:05.63]That wasn't my own teammate.
[26:10.73]That was like car two and punches.
[26:12.23]Alright.
[26:13.05]Rushing, passing, we got that pretty much done.
[26:15.33]This is very quick.
[26:20.18]They don't make games like this anymore.
[26:22.51]You know, when you can just punch people on the other team.
[26:25.49]Or on your own team, for that matter.
[26:30.21]51 seconds left in the second quarter.
[26:33.13]And, oh boy, third and two at the LA 40.
[26:39.18]Like anyone cares.
[26:39.98]Word around here is you have hands like flypaper.
[26:42.16]Well, put the ball in the air and show me what you can do.
[26:45.18]Hey, open receiver.
[26:46.12]That's got to be open.
[26:47.26]That's what I'm seeing here, kid.
[26:50.41]That was a nice catch, but let's see how you do under real pressure.
[26:52.93]Alright, so you do a clash catch.
[26:53.89]Get some of your clash energy and make sure you come down with the pass.
[26:56.87]Catch must be at least 20 yards.
[26:59.86]Okay.
[27:05.78]Got it.
[27:08.70]And I broke the tackle too.
[27:10.84]I'm still good.
[27:11.58]Now that is the way to execute.
[27:15.43]Press and hold L2 while the ball is in the air to enter a clash.
[27:17.69]Yeah, it's a guaranteed catch if you have a full meter.
[27:19.25]Okay, hold L2 while the ball is in the air.
[27:20.41]Press triangle to make the intended receiver do an unleashed catch when the ball is in range.
[27:49.39]I didn't do it?
[27:50.07]These guys are made out of peanut brittle.
[28:02.46]These bones are made out of like candy floss.
[28:10.86]It's break like five seconds later.
[28:13.60]They have pretty bad lag.
[28:15.09]Alright So yeah, I have to make them do it so like this There we go Freakin standing what's a touchdown without it?
[28:30.73]So we're sitting touchdown and show No
[28:39.57]Is it halftime?
[28:40.13]Alright, who's the halftime show?
[28:48.77]Oh, it's halftime!
[28:50.11]No, that's going to be embarrassing.
[28:51.04]Never mind.
[28:57.76]And then, what was it?
[28:58.46]X, X, square, square?
[28:59.12]I don't remember what it was.
[29:03.14]Give us a halftime show?
[29:05.90]Uh... I can't.
[29:10.72]I can't do a- I don't- I'm not prepared for this.
[29:28.69]That's a fail?!
[29:30.11]Why?!
[29:31.62]XX circle circle, not square.
[29:33.34]Dammit.
[29:42.03]Beer Chuck.
[29:42.45]That's a $50,000 penalty.
[29:42.83]Is that allowed in football?
[29:44.89]Uh, no.
[29:45.01]No, none of it is actually.
[29:46.13]Pain, injuries, glory.
[29:46.83]This is where we get to see the real pain.
[30:03.84]The whole point of Blitz the League is you're trying to make the other team injured.
[30:08.20]You're trying to put people out, hurt them to a point where they can't play in the game anymore.
[30:13.55]That's the point of this game.
[30:15.07]That's not the point of American football.
[30:23.51]Looks like the offense is trying to pass on you.
[30:25.79]Are you going to take that?
[30:26.41]Press X while tackling the ball carrier.
[30:27.58]Go show those receivers what happens when they try and catch a pass in your territory.
[30:31.42]I need to select this.
[30:32.04]I'm sorry.
[30:32.80]I thought you said you had skills.
[30:34.30]Well, I need to know how to select a guy.
[30:35.82]Press X while tackling the ball carrier.
[30:37.22]So I have to just, where's my character?
[30:39.90]Hey, why don't you get your damn head in the game and try again?
[30:43.64]You need to tell me where my character is.
[30:49.42]How do I select a new character?
[30:52.49]Press and hold L2 and press X to execute a dirty hit.
[30:55.91]That's what we want.
[30:56.57]There it is, dirty hit.
[30:57.85]Press X to throw off a blocker.
[30:59.07]Ah.
[31:23.25]That's a success.
[31:23.67]Sack the quarterback with a dirty hit.
[31:25.03]Damn it, I didn't get him.
[31:26.51]It's not gonna be ready.
[31:27.45]You gotta go run right through.
[31:28.75]Dude, you know, you gotta give me more than a second.
[31:32.03]What else am I trying to do?
[31:32.77]I don't have any time.
[31:56.52]These defenders are too good.
[31:58.60]Show me what you've got.
[32:02.86]He like gets rid of the ball immediately.
[32:04.36]My grandmother can do better than that, and she's in a nursing home.
[32:11.19]Pathetic.
[32:12.29]I know I'm the defender, but look at how quickly he gets rid of the ball.
[32:18.99]Sack him!
[32:19.91]Sack him!
[32:20.89]That counts.
[32:21.29]What the hell was that?
[32:21.93]Were you even listening?
[32:27.11]Give me this guy.
[32:27.73]Alright, he throws the ball.
[32:30.92]By the time my character takes a step, the ball's gone.
[32:55.61]Why don't you get your damn head in the game and try again?
[32:57.57]Are you using L2?
[32:58.39]Oh yeah.
[33:06.53]Jesus Christ!
[33:07.35]My grandmother can do better than that and she's in a nursing home.
[33:10.51]Pathetic.
[33:17.30]I know you have it in you.
[33:18.72]Show me what you've got.
[33:21.28]Guys, I'm doing it correctly.
[33:23.06]I'm holding L2.
[33:24.34]I've played this game before.
[33:25.66]The tutorial... How is that a fail?
[33:30.49]I sacked the quarterback.
[33:36.53]It's just the tutorial.
[33:40.37]They forgot to program the quarterback to hold the ball for more than a tenth of a second.
[33:49.11]I'm sorry.
[33:49.99]I thought you said you had skills.
[33:51.83]Now prove it.
[33:54.29]What the fuck?
[34:02.98]What the fuck are you... I'm gonna go with another guy.
[34:08.80]You're not even gonna make the practice squad at this rate.
[34:14.04]I don't know how... Why am I getting failures for sacking the quarterback?
[34:23.14]Alright, do you see how fast he's throwing this ball?
[34:25.72]That counts!
[34:26.12]That's a dirty hit!
[34:26.54]Jesus Christ!
[34:27.52]Alright, unleash all the ball character presses.
[34:35.09]Yeah, I got it.
[34:49.74]Suplex him on his head.
[34:52.63]Didn't... Oh, that guy's... We didn't break any bones or hurt him.
[35:01.77]Alright, last thing.
[35:03.76]And then we're going to do career mode.
[35:05.66]I'm going to do a whole career in the time to take for... Who is the halftime show?
[35:12.68]Have we figured it out?
[35:20.33]Spongebob.
[35:22.77]It's not Spongebob.
[35:24.89]Although that would be great if it was.
[35:26.41]If you're gonna play dirty, you need to learn to call your shots.
[35:29.23]Hit the ball carrier hard, pick the body part of your choice, and make sure he doesn't get back up.
[35:34.73]Oh yeah, Spongebob is the halftime show.
[35:36.91]That is absolute bullshit.
[35:39.93]Perform dirty hit, pick an injury using left, and then pump it up by rapidly pressing X. Oh, he's stiff on me.
[35:53.11]Oh, okay, right, right, I see, I see.
[35:55.35]I remember this.
[35:56.35]You have to pick a place and then spam X. That guy ran into his own teammate.
[36:03.81]Right in the...
[36:23.24]Yeah, bruise those ribs.
[36:24.78]Allow your players to get injured.
[36:27.05]Position your syringe using left and then juice the injured player by pressing X. Get a 50% or better result.
[36:51.40]Here we go, yes, you get steroids.
[36:55.91]Okay, here we go.
[36:59.55]Use the left stick to place the needle as close to the middle of the target as possible.
[37:03.73]The closer you get to the center, the quicker your player will get back into the game.
[37:10.43]Alright, where are we going with this?
[37:11.93]Got it.
[37:12.81]Whoa, you alright?
[37:19.47]As long as you get in the middle.
[37:21.25]Oh, I remember this.
[37:22.95]Allow your priority to pull left and right to prepare for a bone set.
[37:26.14]Then move left and right in the indicated directions when prompted.
[37:28.82]Get a 50% or better.
[37:44.16]Oh, that's a broken shoulder portion.
[37:48.49]Okay, move the left stick and right stick to their respected targets.
[37:56.39]Once the targets are in place, mimic the arrows that appear to snap the bone back into place.
[38:05.56]Sorry, dude.
[38:05.84]Sorry, dude.
[38:06.68]So, I know how to play.
[38:09.48]Let's do it.
[38:09.96]He's ready.
[38:10.40]So, there are lots of things.
[38:12.69]We got campaign.
[38:34.95]Oh god, there's a storyline here.
[38:37.33]Frank, wait, is that the John Madden guy?
[39:00.83]Just stick him with a syringe.
[39:02.03]Halftime?
[39:31.97]Seamless transition into gameplay.
[39:33.36]Let's go.
[39:33.78]I don't know how to kick a ball, though.
[39:41.84]I have no idea how to kick a people.
[39:44.38]There wasn't a tutorial for that.
[39:47.49]I thought he froze time.
[40:00.52]It's a fumble, it's a fumble!
[40:14.61]Neck break.
[40:16.07]That is so illegal.
[40:19.39]Face mask running the whole time.
[40:21.14]You'd be thrown out of the league.
[40:22.46]Yeah, who watched me on that one?
[40:23.58]Pay attention, you may learn something.
[40:30.55]Yeah, yeah!
[40:31.40]Is that what you come to see?
[40:32.76]You come to see me?
[40:33.85]Yeah!
[40:39.99]Oh, wait, we get to see Kingpin up in the... Kid, you're going to be huge.
[40:45.97]The first two-way player this league's ever seen?
[40:47.89]I've got every Fortune 500 company panting to get into bed with you, like horny bridesmaids at the wedding of the century.
[40:54.60]Do you really want to rock the boat?
[41:01.80]Okay, kid.
[41:03.12]We're fucking on.
[41:09.22]Excuse me, Commissioner, I wanted to introduce you to my new client.
[41:12.03]Great to meet you, son.
[41:13.45]Boys, take a look at our next big star.
[41:15.67]Big star?
[41:16.33]This is like an opening GTA cinematic.
[41:17.77]He plays six different positions.
[41:19.27]He's a one-man walking franchise.
[41:20.87]Hey, you know what?
[41:21.87]That's his new nickname, Franchise.
[41:23.29]Well, there's the evil mafia guy.
[41:26.67]Franchise.
[41:28.29]I dig that.
[41:31.46]Well, you'll certainly be the franchise player for the Riot.
[41:35.12]LA traded up to the number one pick to take you.
[41:38.45]I don't like that voice.
[41:39.27]Not evil.
[41:49.32]Good one, son.
[41:50.48]Good one.
[41:50.94]It's no joke.
[41:51.80]The only place I'm going to be able to play is in my hometown.
[41:54.73]You'll play for the team that drafts you.
[41:57.35]I'm sorry about this, but my mind's made up.
[42:00.53]You'll play where I tell you to.
[42:02.65]Then he'll go play center field for New York.
[42:04.49]They just offered him $17 million a year for seven years, guaranteed.
[42:08.65]That's the kind of athlete you're looking at here.
[42:16.71]Look, everybody knows you expanded your league too quickly.
[42:19.47]I mean, six teams in five years?
[42:21.23]Come on.
[42:21.63]Now you're choking on it.
[42:22.77]And your so-called owners, they couldn't raise the money for those new teams.
[42:26.43]So you had to offer stock to the public.
[42:28.71]And now you get a once-in-a-lifetime cash cow who could save your league.
[42:34.86]And all he's asking for is to play for his hometown team.
[42:38.18]Spongebob is in the halftime show.
[42:49.55]They're doing sweet victory.
[42:51.19]Are you kidding me?
[42:52.59]I thought you guys were just fucking around.
[42:54.73]Damn.
[42:54.95]Alright.
[42:55.19]One.
[43:10.99]How do you feel your presence on offense affects your teammates?
[43:13.79]I like to go out there and deliver good passes and let my playmakers do the work.
[43:17.44]As a running back, I know that I need to go out there and control the game.
[43:21.00]They can rely on me to make the big catch.
[43:22.86]I have the versatility to line up and block or split out wide.
[43:25.92]What do I want to do?
[43:28.78]I think, isn't quarterback the most fun?
[43:34.34]Quarterback's like the most fun in a football game.
[43:37.46]I have to go out there and deliver the passes.
[43:39.29]I like to go out there and deliver good passes and let my playmakers do the work.
[43:43.85]The man is a playmaker, pure and simple.
[43:45.87]Next question.
[43:46.94]How does your playoff defense elevate the performance of your team?
[43:51.76]I'm a threat to the quarterback every play.
[43:55.21]They can't contain me.
[43:56.15]Any run or short yardage pass that enters my territory is going to be, they're going to pay a price.
[44:01.41]I'm the general of the secondary.
[44:02.87]I'm everywhere I need to be.
[44:04.40]I want to be at safety.
[44:06.26]I'm the ultimate shutdown corner throwing to my receiver.
[44:08.76]Nobody, I don't know what any of this means, but I know that I want to be a safety.
[44:13.48]I want to be the general.
[44:14.32]I want to be the quarterback, and I want to be the general.
[44:16.14]And I want to be done safely.
[44:17.54]I'm the general of the secondary.
[44:19.52]I'm everywhere I need to be.
[44:21.72]As you can see, confidence isn't an issue.
[44:23.80]Who's next?
[44:24.54]How about the looker in the front row?
[44:26.28]Jennifer Mendez, my readers are wondering, what did you do for fun in your youth?
[44:32.29]Does running from the best dodgeball mostly... What do I want?
[44:41.07]Speed?
[44:41.83]Strength?
[44:45.22]I want agility.
[44:47.16]I was the best dodgeball player in my neighborhood.
[44:51.09]+2 agility.
[44:54.21]Little did the old neighborhood know they had a future superstore on their hands, okay?
[44:58.23]How about the gentleman in the back with his hand up?
[45:01.09]Thanks.
[45:01.61]Did you play any other sports in college?
[45:04.71]My curveball could have gotten me in the pros.
[45:07.12]Collegiate champion, wrestler.
[45:09.38]Track and field?
[45:10.48]I played rugby as well as football.
[45:12.06]Twice the pain.
[45:13.36]Ooh.
[45:15.46]I play rugby as well as football.
[45:17.72]Twice the pain.
[45:19.30]I want a good tackle.
[45:20.11]I don't want to hurt people.
[45:21.05]This kid could have gone pro in a half dozen sports.
[45:23.47]He's just that type of athlete.
[45:25.39]Okay, next.
[45:26.61]Jeff Jones, Midwest One News.
[45:28.65]What's a thing most opponents don't realize about you?
[45:31.66]I'm a team player.
[45:32.38]I'll do the dirty work.
[45:33.44]Glory doesn't matter.
[45:34.52]Just the win.
[45:36.37]I studied martial arts.
[45:37.89]I know just where to hit them to make it hurt.
[45:39.81]I think that's the one.
[45:40.49]My hands are like flypaper once I've got the ball.
[45:43.17]I'm holding on to it.
[45:43.85]Catching me is one thing.
[45:44.71]Bringing me down is a whole different story.
[45:46.95]I studied martial arts.
[45:48.93]I study martial arts, so I know just where to hit them to make it hurt.
[45:53.02]They'll be learning soon enough, huh?
[45:54.76]Let's get someone who has not been called on yet.
[45:56.78]I watch anime.
[45:58.18]What have you been focusing on in the off-season?
[46:03.84]Hitting the blocking sled.
[46:06.03]Full contact drills.
[46:07.99]Running the obstacle course or a one-on-one.
[46:13.79]Maybe...
[46:18.82]I think I need more strength.
[46:20.00]Oh, no, maybe full contact.
[46:21.18]Block.
[46:23.06]Tackle.
[46:23.50]No, what's BKT?
[46:26.94]Back tackle?
[46:29.12]I'm all about the full contact drills.
[46:31.62]Gotta train hard to play hard.
[46:34.36]Take it from me, this kid has been working his ass off all summer.
[46:36.78]You're a QB with full tackle points.
[46:38.32]He'll be ready to start day one.
[46:40.34]Who's next?
[46:41.52]Ms.
[46:41.72]Mendez, you have another question?
[46:43.32]If you had to give yourself a nickname, what would it be?
[46:47.07]Uh, nickname.
[46:48.53]The playmaker, the enforcer, the freak.
[46:51.67]Or the wall.
[46:55.26]The enforcer.
[46:56.18]Same as in college.
[46:57.54]Folks can call me the enforcer.
[47:00.24]Can we quote you on that?
[47:02.98]Yeah, yeah, kid.
[47:05.32]The laughing?
[47:06.86]Looks like we only have time for a few more questions.
[47:09.40]Okay, Scott, go.
[47:11.63]Which current player do you model your game after?
[47:13.71]Uh, the speed demon.
[47:16.93]Wide receiver.
[47:18.45]The Bullhawk.
[47:22.34]Full stop.

[47:29.34]Laughback.
[47:33.63]Running back.
[47:35.71]The Enforcer.
[47:38.33]Don't hate me for this, but I'm out of my game after my boy, Bruno Battaglia.
[47:42.83]We're just about out of time here.
[47:44.27]Let's get in one final question.
[47:45.93]Do an archer build.
[47:47.19]Right there.
[47:47.89]What do you want people to say about you five years from now?
[47:51.11]I was one of the quickest guys to ever put on a pair of cleats.
[47:53.95]Everything that I put my hands on, I'd bring it.
[47:56.65]That kid could sure pack one hell of a punch.
[47:59.64]You need a jet pack to be able to keep up with that guy.
[48:02.56]Punch him.
[48:03.10]Five years, huh?
[48:04.66]That kid sure packs one hell of a punch.
[48:09.17]Ladies and gentlemen, that's all we have time for today and I want to thank you all for coming and I hope that you are as excited as I am about seeing him perform this coming season.
[48:27.90]Why does it taunt me in every game?
[48:30.79]Do I have to get taunted in every fucking game I play?
[48:34.29]I don't know why.
[48:40.37]Alright, Blazing Fast Scrambler with a lot of tackle.
[48:44.75]First name, Kid.
[48:45.85]Alright, first name... Jex?

[49:51.61]Mr. That's perfect.
[49:57.14]But what if you never get to the Super Bowl?
[50:00.84]Select your city.
[50:01.78]Alright, where is it?
[50:05.36]Nope.

[51:52.11]That word doesn't look right.
[51:58.73]The Las- does that- is that correct?

[53:45.70]Here we go.
[54:15.81]A little darker, I think.
[54:19.81]Maybe a little bit lighter.

[54:29.16]Here's the uniform.
[54:30.08]Holy fuck, that's ugly.

[55:59.33]Where's the Star Wars socks, please?
[56:09.02]So we got Mr. Super Bowl, Captain of the Super Bowls.
[56:27.59]These pistachio ice cream, man.
[56:29.57]Are we still at the halftime show?
[56:33.33]How long is this shit?
[56:35.13]Agent.
[56:35.95]Welcome to your first week in the league franchise.
[56:38.49]Don't let the commish get you down.
[56:39.75]You've got a sweet career ahead of you.
[56:41.85]As the team captain, you've got to support your team.
[56:43.75]Play hard during games.
[56:44.77]Make sure everyone is training every week.
[56:46.33]Keep them on the best supplements you can afford.
[56:48.55]And don't forget about socializing.
[56:50.33]Hit the club scene.
[56:51.48]Make a name for yourself off the field as well.
[57:21.50]Alright, so we got the trainer.
[57:23.66]Roster stats.
[57:24.44]Lifestyle.
[57:26.02]I think you can go to jail in this game if I remember.
[57:28.08]You can get like arrested for like breaking stuff and punching people.
[57:32.32]Alright, wins to advance five.
[57:33.52]I need like seven division games remaining.
[57:36.03]$100,000.
[57:37.91]Trainer.
[57:39.27]Juicing.
[57:40.05]Oh, you can take drugs.
[57:41.35]Now, okay, training.
[57:43.41]Train your starting players yourself or have the team's trainer take care of it.
[57:46.43]It's your call.
[57:48.70]I wanted to do the training myself.
[57:50.68]No, I don't.
[57:51.20]This is way too many people.
[57:54.48]Assign the trainers automatically.
[57:57.04]Juicing.
[57:58.14]You can juice up to three players each week, and different juices are more suited to different positions.
[58:02.99]Keep an eye on your risk meter when buying illegal drugs.
[58:06.03]As risk gets higher, so do the chances of getting busted by the league.
[58:11.31]So, should I take drugs?
[58:12.87]No, we don't need to do this.
[58:14.03]Not yet.
[58:14.41]Upgrades.
[58:16.64]Alright, so for tackle, it's 105 grand.
[58:21.30]I don't have enough money.
[58:22.44]We're just gonna do it.
[58:22.94]We're just gonna play.
[58:25.81]Lifestyle.
[58:27.29]Girlfriends and sponsors.
[58:31.11]I haven't even made a name for myself.
[58:32.81]Cheap helm.
[58:33.35]These cheaply made lids are as old as the league helmet policy.
[58:37.04]They barely offer more protection than your skull.
[58:40.40]So I don't have any sponsors.
[58:41.94]Not yet.
[58:42.60]I gotta make a name for myself.
[58:43.52]Let's go.
[58:46.02]Las Vegas must stay within five points at the final score to win.
[58:51.68]I can bet money on my own team.
[58:55.65]Max bet.
[58:56.17]The Philadelphia Brawlers live up to their name for this style of play.
[58:59.95]They cheat as much as they can and get away with far more than they should.
[59:03.49]Defensive end H.J.
[59:04.85]Latshaw was just another unruly Philly fan last year.
[59:07.91]Until a fight spilled onto the field and Latshaw beat his ass to earn himself a child.
[59:18.28]The rest is history.
[59:20.26]Just like a fat guy fan that came in and beat everybody up.
[59:30.34]Just the WWE NFL.
[59:32.66]No, this is not an NFL.
[59:34.86]This is the Blitz the League League.
[59:42.83]There he is.
[59:43.15]They've got dirty defense, but they have very poor offense.
[59:46.17]So they play dirty and they cheat, but they don't score very many points.
[59:51.42]Remember, it's 30 yards for a first down.
[59:54.32]There he is.
[59:54.82]What?
[60:12.44]I don't... Why?
[60:13.60]I... Maybe I had a diaper.
[60:17.37]Oh, I love this game.
[60:18.45]Alright, we're gonna go with, uh... We're gonna go with, uh... World Record Trail.
[60:26.88]Passing play.
[60:33.78]Alright, got some yards.
[60:35.26]Got a little yardage.
[60:36.02]Seven yards.
[60:38.10]The Las Vegas diapers.
[60:42.36]HB float.
[60:43.42]I didn't make the away uniform!
[60:48.18]Watch this.
[60:51.50]Fuck.
[60:53.29]I didn't do it early enough.
[60:54.09]There's no nudity?
[60:59.87]What are you talking about?
[61:00.75]Nudity?
[61:01.09]Oh, there's people dancing in the background.
[61:02.57]Oops.
[61:03.86]It's alright.
[61:04.30]This is the Hotline Miami team.
[61:14.31]Oh, you dumbass.
[61:15.57]God damn it.
[61:16.11]No, I'm going for it.
[61:18.45]I'm going for it.
[61:19.03]He fades back.
[61:31.31]We'll go with speed.
[61:31.81]Let's do... Half back, double back.
[61:33.29]Alright.
[61:58.00]That was bullshit.
[61:59.03]What are you guys supposed to be?
[62:05.03]Hail Mary into the end zone.
[62:08.39]And watch this.
[62:08.83]I'm going to fucking just run with the quarterback.
[62:16.60]Ha ha.
[62:23.04]Alright, now I gotta, I gotta kick it.
[62:24.46]I gotta get a field goal here.
[62:26.51]Field goal, fake field goal pass.
[62:29.43]I need, I want two points.
[62:33.35]That's a two point conversion, ladies and gentlemen.
[62:40.21]Regular kick off, I don't know how to do this though.
[62:42.17]What the fuck is going on?
[62:55.27]Wow!
[62:56.29]Take him down!
[63:01.24]Okay, so I'm on defense now.
[63:03.78]We're gonna go with cover plays.
[63:04.82]Man up.
[63:05.04]I'm the man in the back.
[63:16.50]Not very many yardage.
[63:18.42]I'm good.
[63:19.72]First quarter's already over.
[63:23.44]When do someone's balls explode?
[63:25.64]You just wait.
[63:27.40]It'll happen very shortly.
[63:29.92]Oh, fuck.
[63:34.04]Oh, fuck.
[63:38.68]Oh, fuck.
[63:42.22]Philadelphia, get some monster yardage on that play.
[63:49.96]Don't forget about the bet.
[63:51.10]I gotta be within five points.
[63:55.94]Oh my god.
[63:56.64]No, no, no.
[63:59.36]I almost got the quarterback too.
[64:00.64]Shit.
[64:05.08]Goal line.
[64:06.00]Just bump.
[64:07.87]Everybody fucking just get in there.
[64:19.00]Splinting has the safety.
[64:21.45]It's alright, they're only gonna get one point.
[64:25.49]No, they're going for it.
[64:26.73]Alright.
[64:34.90]No, you don't get it.
[64:37.00]No such thing as pass interference in this game.
[64:47.59]Now we're gonna catch this.
[64:49.21]Why doesn't everybody just get it?
[64:54.48]Shit!
[64:54.76]I got a time loop there.
[64:57.38]Philadelphia has a super move where they're gonna be able to hurt me real soon.
[65:02.62]This one right here.
[65:03.52]I gotta be careful.
[65:05.02]Something bad could happen right now.
[65:08.65]What the fuck just happened?
[65:10.23]Oh no!
[65:11.11]I was trying to... Okay.
[65:13.63]I thought that was a running play.
[65:25.56]Fuck.
[65:26.66]I'm in trouble.
[65:27.66]I'm gonna have to kick a field ball.
[65:32.97]Let's do a trick play.
[65:34.01]How about slip and dip?
[65:36.81]I'm going with a slip and dip.
[65:44.39]Oh no!
[65:46.71]What did you do to my brain?
[65:49.00]Am I dead?
[65:49.54]Oh, come on!
[65:51.68]He turned off my break.
[65:53.18]It's alright, he's only up three plays.
[66:00.25]I brought him back to life.
[66:01.53]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[66:03.79]I gotta get some- I gotta make a play here.
[66:38.89]How about stream Why did I do that because I can Okay, they're taking a timeout What down is it third down, alright, let's stay let's crush them Chaos I'm gonna stay back
[67:09.95]Really?
[67:11.13]You gotta be kidding me.
[67:12.67]That was two tackles and he dodged them both.
[67:14.61]He dodged two tackles?
[67:15.47]Just fucking block it.
[67:16.09]Get in there.
[67:16.43]Don't matter, all I need is one.
[67:17.33]I need to touch him.
[67:39.98]I need a touchdown and I win the game.
[67:41.78]Alright, is there... Oh no.
[67:53.33]No, they keep turning my brain off.
[67:55.07]It's gonna be another fumble, isn't it?
[67:56.27]No.
[67:57.27]Only have three players.
[68:09.26]Only one stamina loss.
[68:10.36]I need one more blip.
[68:12.58]I gotta... Okay, I gotta get some yards here.
[68:14.18]Parry.
[68:14.32]We're going with this.
[68:15.36]I'm gonna go run and play.
[68:17.96]I have to... I have to get a good hit here.
[68:19.14]Ow.
[68:19.24]Damn.
[68:19.40]Time out.
[68:38.24]I'm gonna go for the guy on the left.
[68:45.54]I got it.
[68:47.75]I have to get like an end zone pass right now.
[68:50.21]We have to go for it.
[68:53.73]Ah, shit.

[69:12.65]Alright, just kick a field goal.
[69:19.83]I don't know how to kick a field goal though.
[69:21.25]Just a field goal.
[69:22.67]How do you do it?
[69:30.76]Okay, you just have to tap it.
[69:31.86]Okay.
[69:33.59]On top.
[69:33.93]Who gets the ball?
[69:35.09]It's good.
[69:36.65]Alright, that was a good kick.
[69:49.54]I got a full meter, by the way.
[69:50.84]I'm not going to use it.
[69:51.54]Not until I need to.
[69:52.52]Take it!
[70:00.08]Boom!
[70:08.22]Yeah, I can sprint with R2 instead of using the meter, right?
[70:11.02]Alright, we're gonna stay balanced.
[70:12.82]Should I try to break some of his neck?
[70:17.17]I wonder.
[70:17.55]That's fucking hurt, this guy.
[70:27.01]No hurt?
[70:27.47]He didn't get hurt?
[70:30.36]I thought I was gonna hurt him.
[70:31.16]I was trying to, like, break his body.
[70:39.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[70:45.68]Hello?
[70:50.26]Alright, anticipate.
[70:53.10]We're gonna stay back.
[70:56.57]Nah, I don't think so, buddy.
[71:01.21]I'm not gonna pull this bullshit on me.
[71:07.55]Fourth down, what are you gonna do?
[71:12.53]Let's do prevention.
[71:14.10]Just prevent.
[71:16.64]No.
[71:17.60]Just balance it out.
[71:19.36]Lockdown.
[71:21.04]Oh, they're punting it.
[71:22.94]He's actually punting it in this game.
[71:25.42]You go for it every time in this game.
[71:27.10]What are you doing?
[71:29.30]It's fake.
[71:30.92]It's not fake.
[71:33.86]Oh, god damn it.
[71:39.81]It's alright.
[71:41.41]It's alright.
[71:43.44]Is that good?
[71:46.26]That's a good question.
[71:49.79]Alright, I gotta get... I have to get a parry here.
[71:52.11]Have to.
[71:53.33]I didn't think that that would work, but I just did it.
[71:57.86]I'm not a franchise.
[71:59.04]Corner look.
[72:13.65]You can taunt.
[72:14.43]No, no, no, no.
[72:16.37]Oh, I got some points there.
[72:22.39]Now they need to score 13, 14.
[72:23.50]They get a score so I can get my money, right?
[72:48.95]That's, that's alright.
[72:50.79]I'm gonna fucking hurt somebody.
[72:51.83]Well, I tried.
[72:56.87]I tried to hurt somebody.
[73:00.24]Am I actually, so I just, I have to be more than five.
[73:08.98]I love the incomprehensible fake John magic.
[73:14.48]I mean, there's a lot of ways you can say something like that, but that guy just got his ass in.
[73:21.83]How about Zone Blitz?
[73:25.03]I don't know what any of these mean.
[73:27.68]I'm not gonna lie, I don't know a thing about this.
[73:29.46]All I know is that you punch people and you can suplex them on their back and they break their neck.
[73:35.82]What the hell is he saying?
[73:36.62]How's the Super Bowl going?
[73:37.56]Patriots have the ball.
[73:38.58]Still 3-0.
[74:07.68]of the same bullshit.
[74:08.98]Where you going with it?
[74:14.54]Where you going with it?
[74:17.19]Where you going with it?
[74:18.01]Somebody get him!
[74:18.65]Give me a break.
[74:19.83]How did nobody get him?
[74:20.51]Super Bowl.
[74:37.20]Nope.
[74:37.32]Let's go with a lockdown.
[74:38.04]Spongebob is singing the Doom OST.
[75:08.91]I got a full meter.
[75:09.79]I'm going for it.
[75:10.41]I'm going for a kill shot here.
[75:13.71]I got to get that ball.
[75:16.77]We're going with a fucking total blitz here.
[75:20.14]I got to go for it.
[75:21.08]It's alright.
[75:24.00]There you go.
[75:47.91]Still ahead.
[75:48.37]I need to get another touchdown.
[75:52.35]Are they gonna kick on sides?
[75:53.37]They might.
[75:54.67]Are they?
[76:03.40]Oh no, that's my... Stay down.
[76:18.11]Okay, so fuck this Hail Mary all the way down and I'm gonna do an unleash catch and catch it Why would you turn around?
[76:39.99]You know, here's what I'm thinking.
[76:41.61]Next week, just let him call.
[76:42.79]Balance.
[76:43.11]We're going to do... Okay, I need to get a good... I'm not going to unleash this yet.
[76:47.75]Let's run the clock out.
[76:51.23]Alright, that's the first down.
[76:59.84]They're doing a timeout.
[77:00.94]I'm going to run again.
[77:01.92]Red zone offense here.
[77:15.18]What do you got to say about that?
[77:21.00]See you later.
[77:22.20]Oh, what the hell are you talking about?
[77:25.43]They don't have a meter either.
[77:26.21]It's over.
[77:32.07]Zero meter.
[77:32.61]This is my game today.
[77:36.90]Okay.
[77:42.92]Yeah!
[77:44.44]Just kick it off normally.
[77:45.44]See if I can get an injury here.
[77:56.99]That was fucking pretty good, but I didn't injure him.
[77:59.59]Just put his stamina down.
[78:05.64]Who the hell is it?
[78:06.20]It's supposed to be John Madden.
[78:07.76]But not John Madden.
[78:08.70]It's like fake John Madden.
[78:16.02]I have to injure somebody.
[78:22.04]Why did you fall down?
[78:26.93]Break his back in half!
[78:33.57]Why am I excited about that?
[78:41.33]Break his back in half!
[78:43.80]It's the game.
[78:44.44]It's the video game doing it to me.
[78:46.22]Now we're just going for something more dire than that.
[78:57.91]Jermo wants blood.
[79:03.35]I'm gonna get it.
[79:04.81]You'll see it.
[79:05.99]I'm gonna tear somebody's leg off.
[79:11.18]They can't do nothing.
[79:11.86]Let's do balance.
[79:12.24]Coming back in.
[79:12.80]Alright.
[79:13.04]I got one more opportunity to really hurt somebody.
[79:14.80]Get a pass.
[79:34.86]That would have been it, probably.
[79:35.74]That was the last attempt.
[79:37.36]Oh, that's it.
[79:37.96]That's it.
[79:38.32]Game over.
[79:39.61]I'll take my money, too.
[79:40.63]Can I still hurt somebody, you think?
[79:42.71]Let's try to hurt somebody.
[80:09.74]Come on, you can do it!
[80:10.74]You can do another touchdown.
[80:12.80]Taunt!
[80:16.70]And he's in!
[80:18.29]Touchdown!
[80:20.17]And so, Las Vegas wins the game.
[80:22.53]37-21.
[80:23.89]I'll take it.
[80:28.47]Beat Philadelphia.
[80:29.35]Passing yards, rushing yards, return yards, sacks, fumbles, recovered.
[80:37.68]Uh, 22 times 2 points.
[80:39.02]Okay, 5k.

[80:42.16]That's how you make money.
[80:45.24]Wager.
[80:45.68]Winner.
[80:48.21]$207,000 for that game.
[80:52.59]You've unlocked... Concept art.
[80:56.27]Movies.
[80:57.91]Jackpot trophy.
[81:00.92]This game's very fun.
[81:04.18]What's your trophy level now?
[81:05.54]I have no idea.
[81:10.21]Phone.
[81:11.11]We're off to a good start.
[81:12.62]Keep it up and you'll be drawing all the right kinds of attention.
[81:15.18]I'm talking sponsors, of course.
[81:16.62]The better you play, the more sponsors will come looking for your endorsement.
[81:20.54]And that means some sweet new equipment for you and your team.
[81:23.64]Jeremiah, agent.
[81:26.22]Oh, it's Kim.
[81:27.47]Kim, what's up?
[81:28.31]Hi, franchise.
[81:29.31]This is Kim.
[81:30.65]I'm acting on behalf of your agent to explore your marketing potential.
[81:34.31]You are already generating major interest.
[81:37.17]If you can put in a strong performance this Sunday...
[81:40.23]I can work my magic with the sponsors.
[81:42.47]Okay.
[81:42.87]Franchise must gain over 200 combined yards.
[81:47.95]Okay.
[81:49.91]Wow!
[81:50.59]What a game!
[81:52.02]How many yards did you rack up?
[81:53.58]Hell, I stopped counting!
[81:55.14]But whatever it was, it gave our new sponsor a major hard-on.
[81:58.08]They couldn't wait to sign on the dotted line.
[82:01.84]You're awarded the Protector Helmet by Value Tech.
[82:07.68]Sponsors, let's... Protector is +2 to resist injury.
[82:14.05]The name on the helmet says it all.
[82:15.31]It isn't the most comfortable headgear in the world, but it will certainly protect your players from wide variety of injuries that other helmets would not.
[82:23.89]Alright, nice.
[82:26.29]Is it on?
[82:26.74]It's just on, right?
[82:27.56]Yeah.
[82:30.18]Okay, so I want... Let's see here.
[82:32.32]I got money, right?
[82:38.89]Let's see.
[82:39.97]It's 125,000 for the first level.
[82:45.38]I need some better speed.
[82:47.50]I think so.
[82:49.34]Put ankle weights on.
[82:50.34]Provides a little extra resistance in training sessions to really strengthen those quad and calf muscles.
[82:57.32]Tackling.
[82:58.17]This will keep all the offensive players healthy and practice and all the defenders to unleash on some helpless pads.
[83:08.75]Tackle and... This is why... I'm not parrying well.
[83:16.35]Because it's break tackle.
[83:20.08]It was so low.
[83:23.46]That's why.
[83:25.26]I think there was only like 11 points.
[83:29.84]Breaking tackles, I can't do them.
[83:31.42]I have to put this on.
[83:36.91]That's alright for now.
[83:38.66]Who's injured?
[83:41.60]Each staff subtracts one weak.
[83:43.86]Broken collarbone.
[83:46.17]Okay.
[83:47.91]So, he's out for one game.
[83:51.43]Upgrade facilities.
[83:52.63]Purchase adds two additional staff for 15 grand.
[83:55.59]Yeah, just do it.
[83:56.53]Alright, now who should illegally juice?
[84:05.30]Offense.
[84:05.94]I'm going to juice this week.
[84:08.82]Choose drug.
[84:10.88]Reduce the stamina loss from tackles by 25%.
[84:12.36]It's one of the cheapest over-the-counter drugs in the market, but it's very effective in keeping the body healthy for a long haul.
[84:19.31]Trilafine decreases class drains by 25%.
[84:22.01]I just spit all over myself.
[84:27.77]Everyone's so, like, sad about this.
[84:31.01]Just taking a shitload of drugs.
[84:32.37]Increase the stamina loss to opponents by 50%.
[84:37.92]speed up speeds up the heart rate and delivers enormous amounts of energy turbo bar drains 50 slower reduces the chance and severity of injuries regenerate two stamina each play they're on the field reduce stamina loss from attack let's do I like this one increases the stamina loss to opponents
[85:09.74]We're not going to go too crazy here.
[85:15.30]The team, team risk is, I don't want to get it any higher than that.
[85:20.60]Mr. Super Bowl.
[85:25.14]Go crazy.
[85:26.10]No, no.
[85:26.70]Why would I do that?
[85:27.68]Alright.
[85:31.62]So I have to get a lot of yards here, right?
[85:39.39]Max bet.
[85:40.25]No, I don't know.
[85:40.87]Let's do a $5,000 bet.
[85:41.64]I'm not going to be crazy.
[85:43.90]Minus 16.
[85:46.58]Las Vegas must win by more than 16 points.
[85:49.50]No, that's not going to happen.
[85:51.02]That's a lot.
[85:52.46]I'll give $1,000 to it.
[85:55.14]They're a better team anyways.
[85:59.34]Their stats are just overall better than mine.
[86:03.83]I got to play good here.
[86:06.10]You're taking this game seriously.
[86:07.80]It's really fun.
[86:09.10]Okay.
[86:09.62]Baltimore.
[86:37.15]Watch the offense.
[86:43.07]Still 3-0 Patriots in the Super Bowl.
[86:46.42]Hey, welcome to the Super Bowl party.
[86:49.16]There's no party.
[86:50.20]It's just me.
[86:51.70]And NFL... Not NFL Blitz the League.
[86:54.54]It's just Blitz the League 2.
[86:55.56]Hope you're having a party time.
[87:01.87]Get extra mungy... Mungy...
[87:05.92]I get extra money for injuring... Oh my god, those are ugly.
[87:15.61]Oh, that's an eyesore.
[87:19.97]Ugh.
[87:21.59]He didn't even catch it!
[87:24.25]Bench that guy.
[87:28.02]Alright, I need... Do I need to get the yards, or how does it work?
[87:38.55]Oh, that was two though.
[87:40.59]That was two stiff arms.
[87:41.51]Good thing I trained it.
[87:45.62]Do the same play again.
[87:46.36]They're not even gonna fucking see it coming.
[87:47.48]No!
[88:08.28]Are you kidding me?
[88:12.45]How is that possible?
[88:15.61]This is the guy.
[88:17.03]That's the guy.
[88:17.85]Nice tackle.
[88:20.79]And beat the shit out of him, too.
[88:21.81]This is the guy.
[88:22.77]Oh, he fought me off.
[88:23.81]That's the guy, though.
[88:24.43]I got a power.
[88:24.89]I'm going for it.
[88:37.93]We're going to go anticipate.
[88:39.61]I'm going to injure this dude.
[88:41.71]I'm going right for his legs.
[88:50.03]He's done.
[88:50.61]Got him.
[88:57.91]You're out of here.
[88:59.51]Out for 10 games.
[89:00.85]10 games.
[89:01.53]He's gone.
[89:08.41]Ruptured spleen.
[89:13.26]That was the guy, that was the intro cinematic.
[89:16.40]Although I have to stop him here.
[89:22.84]Just ruined his career.
[89:23.95]Well... That's a... Oh, that punting is shit.
[89:30.55]Why would you punt from here?
[89:32.33]You don't have that far to go.
[89:41.79]Dammit.
[89:45.01]Okay.
[89:45.45]So, we got the ball again.
[89:47.91]We're gonna go with a empty... They cross over the field.
[89:53.95]We're gonna try to catch them if they cross over.
[90:00.20]There.
[90:01.40]Got it.
[90:02.02]Ooh, I didn't get the first down.
[90:11.12]I can run that.
[90:11.68]Let's just go... Croissant?
[90:17.13]No.
[90:18.25]Boat left.
[90:18.65]I just have to step over it.
[90:20.05]Oh, damn.
[90:21.75]Okay.
[90:21.89]Okay, fine.
[90:22.21]Whatever.
[90:22.43]I'm just gonna... We gotta do... We're going for it again.
[90:41.53]Alright, let's go with balance.
[90:42.55]I'm gonna do a pass play.
[90:43.35]Brash, y'all.
[90:43.61]We're going for the guy on the right.
[90:44.87]Ooh!
[90:45.07]Wait, fourth down?
[90:46.01]Didn't I get a first down?
[91:11.59]No, that wasn't a first down.
[91:12.77]What can we do?
[91:14.75]We gotta boot it.
[91:24.86]Open the... Hold on.
[91:25.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[91:25.84]Got it.
[91:26.64]That's a first down.
[91:27.16]Hold on.
[91:27.38]Wait, wait.
[91:27.60]Open the link.
[91:27.92]What are you doing?
[91:29.62]What is happening?
[91:43.66]Oh my god.
[91:47.59]That is, uh... Okay, cool.
[91:52.71]That's good.
[91:53.19]I'll do it the other way.
[91:55.19]I want to see it from both sides.
[91:57.49]I want the bottom to be me and the top to be him.
[92:00.63]That's wonderful, though.
[92:04.87]Do it the other way.
[92:05.39]I got a first down.
[92:06.19]I'm going for...
[92:16.47]I like this one.
[92:17.57]This Fade.
[92:20.61]Touchdown, here we go.
[92:22.09]And I should have Foam Leader for the next, uh... You know, ready, watch.
[92:26.06]Watch X, watch X!
[92:28.04]That was a beautiful catch.
[92:35.39]I'm gonna play it safe.
[92:36.15]Just gonna kick it.
[92:44.51]Just get the... Just regular kickoff.
[92:51.60]No messy stuff.
[92:57.36]Now let's try to hurt someone.
[92:59.92]First chance I get right here.
[93:03.04]Ooh!
[93:03.38]Yeah!
[93:12.44]That's 13.
[93:13.20]Just got it.
[93:13.64]Give me another one.
[93:14.38]For free.
[93:14.78]14-0.
[93:14.82]Let's go.
[93:15.24]Hey, another thing we just did.
[93:17.00]Let's do it again.
[93:17.78]Do I have full meter?
[93:19.00]I don't have full meter, but I can still probably hurt somebody.
[93:45.53]There it is.
[93:46.67]Alright.
[93:47.21]Stomp on his head.
[93:52.55]I got meter again.
[93:53.19]Let's go for it.
[93:55.89]They are actual garbage without their, uh, crutch player.
[93:58.81]Yeah.
[94:01.04]We're gonna get the ball back again.
[94:02.12]A really good thing I took him off.
[94:07.70]See if I can get the ball back.
[94:15.80]What just happened?
[94:23.68]Oh, there it is.
[94:24.16]There it is.
[94:24.46]Hold on.
[94:28.18]New one?
[94:33.22]Jesus.
[94:35.78]Oh.
[94:37.40]What?
[94:40.22]That, oh.
[94:42.17]This is a Ready Player One avatar.
[94:44.03]I don't like this.
[94:53.37]That's me going in the oasis and hanging out.
[95:00.07]Alright, uh... Show us... Hold on, I need to... Yeah, this is worth saving.
[95:10.95]This is what I'm talking about.
[95:11.89]And I'm gonna take a piss break, by the way.
[95:15.09]While you stare at this image.
[95:19.42]This is what I'm talking about when I say my Ready Player One avatar.
[95:23.82]How the hell did you even do this?
[95:24.84]Alright, I'll be right back.
[95:47.98]Alright, hold on.
[95:48.96]Hold on, before I go, you know what this reminds me of?
[95:51.64]This looks like
[95:53.94]This looks like this is supposed to be here.
[95:55.52]Do you know what I mean by that?
[95:58.72]How this is... Like, what?
[96:00.81]Jerma985 stream!
[96:01.99]I'll be right back!
[96:03.73]It's like a cartoon kind of 3D version of me, like a YouTuber kind of thing.
[96:08.49]This looks like I'm supposed to have this here.
[96:16.13]Alright, I...
[98:44.60]I hate this image.
[98:56.56]What am I looking at?
[98:57.64]Oh no.
[99:02.09]Let me like, do like, let me deep dive this.
[99:03.85]Hold on.
[99:07.27]How did you even make this?
[99:15.37]That's so weird and scary that this is possible.
[99:29.24]Welcome back to the show.
[99:31.04]It's germa985.
[99:31.48]Oops, hold on.
[99:44.25]Welcome back.
[99:45.25]It's me, Jerma.
[99:46.27]Welcome back to the show.
[100:14.08]How do I get this off?
[100:20.93]His teeth aren't showing.
[100:23.07]Side by side.
[100:24.19]No, I... Oh, let me just open this fresh beer.
[100:30.99]That's so loud.
[100:31.77]Oh, I look at OBS and I crack a tab and it blows out the audio every time.
[100:41.90]It's a Coke.
[100:43.53]You want me to prove it?
[100:44.21]There, proved it.
[100:48.68]Now hopefully the game didn't crash, me trying to prove it.
[100:50.64]Alright, so I gotta beat, uh, by more than, I gotta win by more than 16 points.
[100:53.96]Shoulda bet, fuckin' max bet on this.
[100:57.96]I'm gonna get it.
[101:01.19]Can we test the sync here, by the way?
[101:02.51]One, two, three, four.
[101:04.43]One, two, three.
[101:06.17]Den, den, den, den, den, den, den.
[101:09.23]We good?
[101:15.22]Alright, I get the ball, right?
[101:17.04]How are the Patriots doing?
[101:20.02]Oh fuck, it's tied up.
[101:23.32]It's tie game.
[101:24.14]3-3, they got a field goal.
[101:29.03]What in the name of fucking god just happened?
[101:35.25]They just Donkey Kong barreled.
[101:37.67]They were the barrels.
[101:39.57]The ball was Donkey Kong.
[101:44.11]Offense with a long way to go here on third down.
[101:46.51]Take his helmet off.
[101:57.06]Alright, this is fourth down.
[101:58.38]Are they going to punt it?
[101:59.76]Hold on.
[102:02.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[102:02.84]They're going to punt, aren't they?
[102:04.14]Punt return.
[102:05.06]Yeah, they are.
[102:13.05]Turn the punt.
[102:14.37]I don't have any meter though.
[102:16.23]He didn't even catch that.
[102:17.19]It just bounced in his hands.
[102:18.09]I got something for shedding that tackle, didn't I?
[102:25.32]Another one.
[102:25.86]Hold on.
[102:26.28]What is this one?
[102:30.54]These are all so... I just looked at the other one.
[102:37.46]This one is also as detailed.
[102:41.09]There are more.
[102:45.81]Okay, guys.
[102:48.37]It's getting to a point where when people search me, they're not going to know what the real one is.
[102:53.17]Let's just put them all up on the screen eventually here.
[102:59.73]Let me get to the end of this.
[103:06.28]Okay, that's scaring me.
[103:07.48]I need to close that.
[103:08.82]End of the third quarter in the Super Bowl, by the way.
[103:15.17]Alright, let's go with pass play.
[103:17.30]Big cross here.
[103:19.96]I have 200 images of your face.
[103:21.70]No one should ever have that many faces.
[103:27.46]Got it.
[103:27.76]Yes!
[103:28.06]And that's a full meter.
[103:45.61]Without that player, they are absolutely worthless.
[103:49.03]Fuck it, we're just gonna run it.
[103:51.50]I got a full meter.
[103:52.90]We're gonna do an HP crush.
[103:58.38]Speaking of full meter.
[104:03.88]Got it back.
[104:04.44]It's a good thing that you killed that guy.
[104:17.11]Jerma actually knows that he's... Jerma actually sounds like he knows what he's talking about.
[104:22.20]I know some sports stuff.
[104:23.74]Some.
[104:24.78]Oops.
[104:27.96]I know that this first one... No, I know what that is.
[104:33.07]Break his fucking neck.
[104:34.91]Really?
[104:35.23]That's too bad.
[104:37.27]He's at 85% though.
[104:45.43]I don't really follow football that well, considering, if you think about it, the New England Patriots are in the Super Bowl right now, and I have a browser tab open just seeing how the score is.
[105:06.74]So, I mean, I'm not that much of a big fan of the sport.
[105:10.46]I do think it's interesting sometimes.
[105:13.02]Baltimore leads by 22.
[105:14.70]Let's see if I can make something happen here.
[105:18.94]I got a long way to go.
[105:20.00]Cheerleaders.
[105:28.70]They really are doing just kind of the dumbest dances.
[105:32.69]To me, this is mocap.
[105:35.67]Okay.
[105:45.05]That was a fumble.
[105:48.29]Are they going to punt it?
[105:51.57]Yeah, they're punting.
[105:55.23]Am I going to shut this team up?
[106:09.39]Again, I didn't even catch it.
[106:12.85]Holy fuck.
[106:17.19]I ran out of gas.
[106:18.47]It's okay.
[106:21.11]Let's go with... Let's do our own Donkey Kong barrel play.
[106:25.06]Bring it back.
[106:27.80]Ooh, he used his power there.
[106:29.58]I gotta be careful.
[106:34.97]Don't run it.
[106:35.43]I'm gonna pass it.
[106:46.61]Because I could get a fumble here or somebody could get hurt.
[106:54.42]Ooh.
[106:54.80]Okay.
[106:58.48]Trick play.
[107:00.48]Break.
[107:00.92]Delay.
[107:01.40]No.
[107:02.44]Snowflake.
[107:03.71]Maniac.
[107:04.81]They just go all over the place.
[107:09.37]How's this for a maniac?
[107:13.13]Wide open.
[107:15.15]Just land, land, land.
[107:16.27]I'm not getting unleashed.
[107:18.71]If you don't know, if he uses unleashed, there's a high chance that it'll either break my neck or will fumble the ball.
[107:27.95]So I need to just down myself.
[107:33.48]No!
[107:33.92]That's what I'm talking about!
[107:36.54]I survived.
[107:36.92]Oh, that crunch was louder than my morning brand flakes.
[107:39.98]The defender just exploded them.
[107:41.70]Kind of like my morning brand flakes, but in reverse.
[107:45.03]As we reach the end of the third quarter, Las Vegas leads by 22.
[107:49.03]The rambling boomer is the best part of the game.
[107:54.54]Everything is a boomer.
[107:58.00]Everything is a boomer.
[107:59.40]All adults over the age of like 30 are boomers.
[108:05.14]End zone.
[108:06.10]And it's intercepted.
[108:08.24]Keeps his feet moving.
[108:09.60]And he's down.
[108:10.22]God damn it.
[108:10.68]That's a touchback.
[108:11.10]Shit.
[108:11.20]Some people might say it was a bad pass.
[108:12.50]But it really was a good pass.
[108:13.94]It just went to the wrong guy.
[108:15.32]So it was a bad pass to the right guy.
[108:18.29]But a good pass to the right guy.
[108:19.39]That's Boomer in the background.
[108:20.29]But perfect passes just are, you know, they're perfect for the wrong team.
[108:23.73]That's all I'm saying.
[108:28.35]Get it back.
[108:29.87]Oh, shit.
[108:30.48]Baltimore covers it up.
[108:47.25]That was so abrupt.
[108:51.20]Oh, man.
[108:52.52]That could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten to him before the defender.
[109:01.16]He just bounced off the ropes, and I just.
[109:05.90]Why won't they make another one of these?
[109:09.00]Seriously, I don't even give a shit about football, really, but... Oh god, I would play this all day.
[109:14.30]Fourth down still.
[109:20.84]Are they gonna punt?
[109:22.74]You can't punt.
[109:23.34]You have to go for it.
[109:25.76]Fourth and long.
[109:26.60]They really need a big play here.
[109:30.47]Come back, come back, come back.
[109:31.89]Back to pass.
[109:34.41]The quarterback needs to make sure his throw gets there before the defender, I think.
[109:38.61]Alright, let's go for a shutout.
[109:41.69]Crucial series of downs here.
[109:43.49]All in about the 24.
[109:44.13]He doesn't have any meter or anything.
[109:49.42]That's just getting embarrassing.
[109:53.78]That's embarrassing.
[109:54.48]Las Vegas increases their lead.
[110:03.54]It's a new image.
[110:07.96]What the hell is going on?
[110:10.67]Is it possible we're making progress?
[110:13.31]Wait, just wait.
[110:14.21]I need to put that on.
[110:19.23]I'll get a conversion here.
[110:20.93]Right there.
[110:21.42]The conversion is good.
[110:33.75]Let's add insult to injury here.
[110:37.61]Yeah, should have made that bet, right?
[110:40.46]Let's try to injure him.
[110:44.10]Oh, I wanted that tackle, not you.
[110:49.28]Shutout.
[110:49.64]Give me the achievement for the shutout.
[110:50.81]Oof.
[110:59.72]That's a fumble.
[111:02.84]Just like spinning wheelhouse kicked him.
[111:04.68]30, can I do a 40 point shutout or 38 point shutout?
[111:07.95]Oh my god!
[111:08.65]Just right at the middle.
[111:33.63]I got it.
[111:34.57]Cross the plane.
[111:35.11]Let's go for a... I'm going to try to get the guy in the middle right.
[111:43.12]He's going to turn around.
[111:48.46]That square's going to turn around right now.
[111:50.91]You dickhead game.
[111:51.93]I'm not going to 36 points.
[112:07.32]Pain, pain, pain.
[112:08.90]Make him hurt.
[112:10.66]Late hit.
[112:11.08]Get it.
[112:11.58]Step on his head.
[112:17.22]Now I can actually do an injury here.
[112:20.56]New link.
[112:24.50]It's going by too fast.
[112:28.62]Oh my god.
[112:29.52]What the fuck are these?
[112:57.22]97% accuracy?
[112:57.95]Really?
[113:00.23]I have another one.
[113:03.25]I want to go for the quarterback though.
[113:05.24]I don't even care about the play.
[113:06.14]I want to hurt the quarterback.
[113:14.00]And he's dropped.
[113:14.76]Oh, he's in trouble.
[113:15.96]That hurts.
[113:16.32]He's not injured, though.
[113:17.34]And the receiver gets taken out before the ball gets near him.
[113:20.31]I don't think he knows what hit him.
[113:21.71]Let's do it again.
[113:22.67]Oh, he's coming back in.
[113:24.33]It's alright.
[113:42.95]Is the announcer drunk?
[113:43.95]No, the announcer is doing a John Madden impersonation.
[113:47.53]John Madden is known at... Okay.
[113:48.97]Okay.
[113:49.23]God damn it.
[113:49.72]No, just fucking shut up.
[114:13.41]Give me the penalty.
[114:16.29]I don't even care.
[114:16.75]I'm fucking hurting someone.
[114:18.77]I can't go across.
[114:21.47]They're doing an onside kick, aren't they?
[114:28.90]Nothing matters.
[114:29.56]It doesn't matter anyway.
[114:39.68]Yeah, it's Frank Caliendo.
[114:41.64]He was on MADtv.
[114:44.50]First down and 30.
[114:45.96]And he did a perfect one-to-one John Madden impression.
[114:50.93]It was pretty ridiculous.
[114:52.35]What was that pass?
[114:54.93]What?
[114:55.93]Is there a replay feature?
[115:00.36]What the hell was this?
[115:08.14]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[115:08.92]Go back.
[115:28.16]I underhanded that ball like 45 yards.
[115:30.64]50 yards.
[115:31.54]Okay.
[115:33.30]He bowling balled it.
[115:35.84]What are we doing for?
[115:37.44]How about Mania?
[115:38.14]No.
[115:38.50]Razzle go.
[115:39.24]Into the end zone.
[115:42.50]It's alright.
[115:43.24]Game over.
[115:46.24]Try to bet the money.
[116:01.12]It's the fourth quarter in the Super Bowl.
[116:02.26]Tied at three.
[116:07.32]Ooh, that's going to be a lot of money.
[116:10.51]Turnovers caused.
[116:11.25]Touchdowns.
[116:12.75]Wager $1,000.
[116:13.11]$256,000.
[116:13.15]That's pretty damn good.
[116:13.93]New link.
[116:37.33]During the cutscene I'm gonna get these saved.
[116:43.91]Have a seat.
[116:47.30]Just have a seat.
[116:48.38]What's this about?
[116:54.26]You're gonna go play with that new Hotshot franchise.
[116:57.22]Why the fuck would I want to play there?
[116:59.76]His team's in Division 3.
[117:02.08]Because I happen to know that the nightmare is gonna cut you at the end of this season.
[117:05.98]Let's put him up here.
[117:06.80]Along with that big contract of yours.
[117:09.50]That's why they traded up to draft Max Carson.
[117:13.18]Oh man, fuck them.
[117:16.22]You might get picked up by another team for a fraction of your current salary.
[117:22.49]Or you can go play with Franchise and keep your deal as is.
[117:33.57]Just tell me one thing.
[117:35.75]What's in it for you?
[117:50.52]God, like... There's too many of these.
[118:02.13]There are too many of them.
[118:05.98]Okay, I swear to God.
[118:07.51]I'm not kidding.
[118:08.19]I don't know.
[118:08.55]Call me like a weirdo if you want.
[118:10.43]But I feel like I look in the mirror and this is what I look like sometimes.
[118:16.67]I'll take a selfie with an iPhone and this is what the image will be.
[118:25.07]I swear.
[118:36.80]Alright, it's Kim.
[118:38.60]It's the front-facing camera?
[118:41.38]Yeah, I know.
[118:42.46]Okay.
[118:43.64]You and I need to get together this evening.
[118:56.14]It's time to go on a date.
[118:58.26]Apparently.
[118:59.91]Mmm, darling.
[119:02.23]You dressed to kill.
[119:03.83]Have time to talk a little business?
[119:06.09]Whatever you like, beautiful.
[119:08.71]We have the opportunity to land the biggest sporting goods company in North America.
[119:13.22]And you need me to do a little meet and greet.
[119:16.09]Their reps will be at the game this Sunday.
[119:18.37]I need you to give me a top-notch performance.
[119:21.87]That's the only time I ever give.
[119:24.80]Get it done on the field, hotshot.
[119:26.94]And perhaps we can celebrate afterwards.
[119:37.85]That one's not even... This one is not even...
[119:43.18]You didn't even try to change it to the other photo.
[119:48.13]You just mutated my face.
[119:56.73]Like, look at... Okay, this one is the agent.
[119:59.06]This one's the agent, too.
[120:00.24]You're getting a little weird.
[120:04.42]And this one is just... I...
[120:15.41]Slowly turning into a gnome.
[120:16.97]Alright, roster.
[120:19.25]I think there's some changes here.
[120:22.79]I got a new player, right?
[120:23.51]Alright, I got offense.
[120:32.20]Quarterback.
[120:33.20]I'm a C+.
[120:35.42]Defense, defense.
[120:36.62]Anybody like... Do I have any Ds?
[120:38.80]Alright, I don't know.
[120:39.52]You guys might have to go here.
[120:40.82]D+.
[120:54.48]They're all C's and D's.
[120:56.90]Lifestyle.
[120:57.94]Sponsors, again.
[121:00.10]Protector.
[121:00.78]Crunch pads.
[121:01.62]+2 tackle.
[121:03.46]Crunch pads help defenders pack a little extra punch in their hits.
[121:06.84]Cool.
[121:09.75]Let's see.
[121:10.57]Trainer.
[121:11.73]Training.
[121:13.53]Assign to training automatically.
[121:15.27]Upgrades.
[121:17.77]More tackle. $255,000.
[121:23.29]Yep.
[121:23.86]I want to be unstoppable.
[121:25.03]What is going on?
[121:59.65]Okay.
[122:02.27]I'm standing looking into a pond.
[122:06.45]In a dramatic part of the movie.
[122:09.02]And somebody dropped a pebble right in the middle of my face.
[122:12.34]In the water.
[122:24.68]That's fucking ridiculous.
[122:25.70]Alright, tackle to tackle.
[122:28.56]I need some, okay, better hands.
[122:31.70]No, I don't have enough money.
[122:33.02]Do I have enough money for anything else?
[122:37.12]Ice bath.
[122:38.06]Get rid of all the swelling, but you still have to be careful of shrinkage.
[122:40.80]Oh.
[122:42.14]That's funny.
[122:47.67]I've seen the fireman.
[122:50.81]Old, we got old boomer hands.
[122:53.69]No, I'm gonna hold the money.
[122:55.23]Let's take some more drugs.
[122:59.10]For me, I like this.
[123:02.38]Turbo bar drains slower.
[123:03.72]Reduce the chance of severity of injuries.
[123:08.49]Gain +2 stamina for every successful clash or unleash move.
[123:12.87]Yeah.
[123:17.37]And... Let's have... Maybe the halfback.
[123:26.20]class drains for the halfback?
[123:28.46]Yeah, I think so.
[123:29.12]Alright, easy with that, the drug risk.
[123:35.88]I gotta do halfback plays here.
[123:37.30]Alright, any, what's this one?
[123:46.22]I just got gnomed.
[123:49.14]Well, there are a million images in the,
[123:57.32]But that's what happens when people are just putting in links.
[124:01.50]Alright, let's go.
[124:04.27]Las Vegas must win by more than 17 points.
[124:06.63]I need better stats than this.
[124:09.17]Train already.
[124:16.02]Fourth quarter.
[124:17.16]What a boring Super Bowl.
[124:18.50]Oh!
[124:18.62]Patriots scored!
[124:19.44]I was going to say, what a boring Super Bowl.
[124:23.42]3-3 for the whole game.
[124:26.84]Patriots up 10-3.
[124:28.98]Seven minutes remaining in the last quarter.
[124:30.30]I mean, Tom Brady really is just so unbelievable.
[124:35.84]5,000.
[124:37.62]The Houston Rioters have been the Division III punching bag since they joined the league three years ago.
[124:50.05]That might be changing this year since they drafted running back Don L. Sullivan in the first round.
[124:54.59]Running back.
[124:55.11]That's the target.
[124:56.33]He's got an effective one-two punch.
[124:58.19]His wicked first to speed followed by a stiff arm jab.
[125:01.77]And he ain't afraid to hit below the belt.
[125:04.31]So if we want to shut down Houston, we need to knock out Sullivan.
[125:11.38]Okay.
[125:11.66]Time to kill this guy.
[125:19.60]Who is this in real life?
[125:21.62]It's all fictional.
[125:23.76]No, people.
[125:24.25]There are no real people in the game, I don't believe.
[125:28.09]This is not a licensed NFL video game.
[125:32.81]Uh, pro, they got a strong running game.
[125:35.59]But their con is their speed.
[125:36.93]How does that make any sense?
[125:38.75]How can you have a slow, strong running team?
[125:41.21]Good evening, everyone.
[125:53.38]It begins.
[125:58.34]It's a dirty hit.
[125:58.94]Right off the bat.
[126:00.06]And I can... Let's go.
[126:01.38]More stamina drain.
[126:03.45]Alright, I got two blips so far.
[126:10.85]Good.
[126:11.03]Right off the bat.
[126:13.23]So, we're going to stop the running game.
[126:14.63]Uh... I'm going to be ready.
[126:19.27]Okay.
[126:26.56]Stop him!
[126:27.32]Stop him!
[126:27.89]Oh, that's him.
[126:29.75]Alright, I gotta take him out.
[126:31.65]Um, I'm gonna say... Crush.
[126:32.43]There he is.
[126:33.05]I see you.
[126:54.82]See that?
[126:55.82]That was me.
[126:56.30]That's called me waiting for you.
[126:59.69]And now I got... Let me... Same deal.
[127:06.09]You want to go for the same guy?
[127:06.95]Go for it.
[127:11.90]Oh, I had an opportunity.
[127:15.94]He didn't make it through, though.
[127:18.32]It's fourth down.
[127:18.82]They're going to punch it.
[127:25.31]Where are the refs?
[127:28.71]Yeah, where are the refs?
[127:32.11]What did- Why would you do that?
[127:33.80]I had punt return and- Oh, God.
[127:37.10]Keeps his feet moving.
[127:46.16]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[127:48.04]Alright, now we taunt.
[127:55.59]That was really, really good.
[127:57.31]A punt returned from the end zone that the guy didn't catch to run back for a touchdown.
[128:01.20]Welcome to hell.
[128:20.45]catch it I got it come on man a little I got it I actually got it I still have a full beater too that is a new image
[128:48.94]Go for the free drop.
[128:49.88]Watch the guy in the bottom right.
[128:51.84]28.
[128:52.06]That's the captain.
[128:58.88]Okay.
[128:59.62]I am not going to select anybody else.
[129:01.25]Because if he gets through, it's a touchdown.
[129:02.59]So I'm staying back.
[129:04.53]There's an actually cursed image in the chat right now.
[129:07.09]That's going to make a throw up.
[129:08.19]I can't look at that.
[129:09.09]I actually just hurt my head looking at that.
[129:13.37]That's all I see now.
[129:14.91]I don't see anything else.
[129:23.46]Third down.
[129:25.26]Let's do it with the flip.
[129:27.74]28 right there.
[129:28.18]They're going to 28.
[129:29.04]I'm going to crush them right when he goes up the middle.
[129:35.91]No.
[129:36.15]Quarter right up.
[129:38.39]Yeah.
[129:39.43]Watch that picture.
[129:42.21]Easy on that picture.
[129:43.01]If you have... If you're sensitive to light rays and sensitive to wacky images, I advise you not to click it.
[129:50.27]Because I just got like a headache for five seconds.
[130:10.18]I can put the hurt on you all day, son.
[130:12.72]Same deal.
[130:14.16]Oh, fuck.
[130:14.56]They're punting.
[130:15.34]Shit.
[130:15.62]Somebody catch it.
[130:17.90]I always figured they're not going to do it.
[130:22.52]Alright.
[130:23.94]There's an opportunity here.
[130:31.28]Couldn't plow through it.
[130:32.84]He's got better stats than I do.
[130:36.14]Let's go... Let's go straight up.
[130:37.96]Got him.
[130:38.46]I might try to do a big... No, no, no.
[130:47.60]Let's run it.
[130:48.83]Run it.
[131:04.78]Crush.
[131:05.74]Halfback crush.
[131:06.84]I have the drug.
[131:07.74]My halfback is on drugs.
[131:11.90]Can't... Can't plow through that, even with drugs.
[131:15.81]That sucks.
[131:17.21]Do it again.
[131:17.59]Damn it.
[131:17.79]How'd he get through?
[131:18.51]Shit, he actually got through.
[131:33.62]Fuck it.
[131:33.92]I'm going for it.
[131:40.03]Fake punt.
[131:43.49]No, I'm just going right... I just had to get the first down.
[131:48.67]That's all I cared about.
[131:51.59]Now, I have to be very careful.
[131:54.15]I gotta get a touchdown right here.
[131:59.10]He lets it fly.
[132:02.35]The ball gets there too late.
[132:04.05]Or should I say the defender got there... Oh, I just got clotheslined.
[132:07.41]Shit.
[132:14.28]Second... I gotta get this now.
[132:22.27]It's alright.
[132:27.03]They got one play.
[132:29.55]At least he blew his Unleash.
[132:33.56]They got one play.
[132:35.30]I'm staying all the way back.
[132:36.48]I ain't gonna let somebody just get across here.
[132:39.02]They don't got it.
[132:42.18]Fuck outta here.
[132:43.24]Four minutes.
[132:49.96]In the Super Bowl.
[132:51.06]Patriots up 10-3.
[132:55.80]He's actually playing safety.
[132:57.85]Sometimes you have to play the game where you're supposed to.
[133:05.41]These dirty hits.
[133:20.78]First and 30.
[133:21.30]This lion.
[133:23.16]Oh, I can't look at that right now.
[133:25.30]Wait.
[133:26.76]Hey, hey.
[133:31.66]Hey, Herbert, thanks for the five community subs.
[133:35.25]Blinks.
[133:37.67]Thank you for the community subs, Herbert.
[133:39.53]Oh, there's too many people coming at me.
[133:58.23]Alright, we're kind of at the... Let's do a goal line here.
[134:05.34]This is not... I mean, it is goal.
[134:10.90]Cut out to the left.
[134:11.60]There it is.
[134:12.08]There it is.
[134:14.42]These guys are very... The defense is very good.
[134:17.63]It's hard to break through.
[134:19.37]Hey, while we got a minute, at the team breakfast this morning...
[134:31.06]Get in there!
[134:31.72]I got an unleash.
[134:32.44]Now, let's just be smart, because they still have their star player.
[134:35.02]First and ten at New England four.
[135:00.14]I'm getting live updates here.
[135:05.25]Alright, somebody just said... Break!
[135:08.03]Come on!
[135:08.35]Injury!
[135:08.51]Yeah!
[135:08.65]Yeah!
[135:09.23]Somebody just said, who would ever move to Las Vegas?
[135:18.20]It's a fucking wasteland.
[135:31.10]Well, hey, Vegas is great.
[135:36.38]What are you talking about?
[135:42.07]That was another touchdown, by the way.
[135:44.65]Those are paying attention.
[135:50.23]Nobody has a meter or anything, so... Just a couple of late hits.
[135:54.93]Step on the helmet.
[136:04.53]Why would you move to Vegas?
[136:06.61]Why would you move anywhere?
[136:07.91]Why did I just get that?
[136:10.97]Then you get a chance to move.
[136:16.25]Angry.
[136:16.43]They can tell I'm angry.
[136:19.81]Here it is.
[136:21.81]Let's go.
[136:31.33]Got it.
[136:31.67]Thank God.
[136:33.23]No, not thank God.
[136:33.91]I'm winning by a lot.
[136:35.51]I've got to see that one.
[136:41.32]That's the... By the way, t-shirts are available.
[136:48.66]If you want a Jerma985 officially licensed t-shirt, there's a new t-shirt store.
[136:55.70]It's on Teespring.
[136:56.60]Go ahead and if you want it.
[136:57.86]The Night Sky is now available and Blue Man is back.
[137:11.40]Please include that image on his shirt.
[137:15.00]That's... No, I don't want to put that on.
[137:17.26]Why?
[137:17.60]Stop him!
[137:19.58]Let's get here.
[137:20.40]Where's my safety?
[137:22.89]Where the hell am I?
[137:39.08]Holy shit!
[137:40.18]They're gonna get a touchdown.
[137:41.10]That was wild.
[137:42.18]I know, I have to kill that guy, but it's easier said than done.
[137:46.28]Oh, I almost blocked it.
[138:07.34]He got taunt killed.
[138:14.07]They gotta get two more full possessions.
[138:23.43]They're not gonna get two full possessions in a minute.
[138:27.78]Oh, what?
[138:28.20]Flush inside, we're gonna go for a run.
[138:40.91]Damn it.
[138:44.26]Who was that?
[138:47.08]It's Robbie.
[138:47.58]No, not Robbie.
[138:48.34]Anybody but Robbie.
[138:49.14]Listen, this isn't working.
[139:10.96]Let's go with long.
[139:12.34]They don't have any meter.
[139:20.11]Got it.
[139:21.41]Oh, there it is.
[139:30.41]Now it's out of reach.
[139:32.64]Pretty much completely.
[139:33.42]Let's go with a little dog shit pass.
[139:42.97]Right here, right here, right here, right here.
[139:48.63]29-7.
[139:52.82]What's the colors?
[139:53.56]The colors are supposed to be the Jerma985 Twitch YouTuber colors.
[140:01.08]They don't really look that good on... They look like it's an ice cream cone, but that's okay.
[140:10.34]Right into my guy.
[140:15.85]They don't look good on anything.
[140:18.92]Well, it looks good on a digital screen as, like, a character.
[140:22.26]Oh, god damn it.
[140:28.95]Oh, nice juke!
[140:32.47]Alright, this is my opportunity here.
[140:35.99]It's time to crush.
[140:38.39]I have an Unleash.
[140:40.71]I'm gonna try to hurt somebody here.
[140:42.25]Let's go.
[140:42.63]They're gonna go to the running back here.
[140:49.65]You stopped my Unleash!
[140:51.97]How would you stop my Unleash?
[140:53.47]I was holding L2 and you stopped my Unleash?
[140:56.73]How?
[140:56.87]He stopped it.
[140:57.47]Don't matter.
[140:58.29]It's legitimately impossible for them to win this game.
[141:01.69]It's impossible.
[141:21.30]Stop my unleash.
[141:21.92]You gotta be kidding me.
[141:25.74]We can try to... There you go.
[141:29.08]You're alright, buddy.
[141:30.20]Bobby, get back in here.
[141:37.36]Goes way downfield.
[141:39.40]And it's caught at the 15-yard line.
[141:43.51]Turns on a dime.
[141:44.39]Full line.
[141:45.97]Touchdown.
[141:47.07]Las Vegas.
[141:47.77]Trying to get a random code. 20.
[141:51.93]Yeah, Robbie comes in the game.
[141:52.93]We'll see what happens.
[141:54.05]It's okay.
[141:54.65]He's 30 seconds in the game.
[142:20.54]There's no way they're gonna have this.
[142:28.56]They might get one more... Touchdown.
[142:30.94]Maybe.
[142:32.11]They still get that guy in the game, so... I'm gonna hang back.
[142:36.77]Awww!
[142:37.95]You gotta hold on to that!
[142:51.50]Quick, kill someone before it ends.
[142:53.74]I might not be able to.
[142:56.43]Let's go for a chaos run.
[143:09.57]Take him out.
[143:12.27]Patriots win Super Bowl?
[143:21.78]Did they?
[143:24.29]There's still like a minute left, right?
[143:31.21]No, he used his Unleashed.
[143:34.21]Not gonna get it.
[143:35.77]Game over.
[143:36.17]Uh, beat Houston.
[143:50.73]Two minute warning for the Super Bowl.
[143:57.96]What a party.
[144:01.22]No injuries, unfortunately.
[144:02.42]A lot of touchdowns.
[144:05.70]I did get the wager.
[144:08.56]Right?
[144:08.78]Because it was 17 points, right?
[144:10.80]Get some concept art.
[144:16.99]Who am I rooting for in the Super Bowl?
[144:20.02]I mean, I'm from Massachusetts.
[144:24.88]I lived there for 30 years.
[144:29.04]The Patriots, probably, if I were to have to tell you.
[144:32.95]Hey, baby.
[144:35.07]Is this?
[144:35.77]Hey, yourself.
[144:45.02]Quick, cut the stream.
[144:48.42]How we doing on training?
[144:49.96]Stats.
[144:52.36]Power rankings, league standings.
[144:55.44]Girlfriends.
[144:59.32]Kim provides exclusive sponsor equipment.
[145:01.84]Marketing professional who specializes in getting superstar athletes together with top sports brands.
[145:08.30]Did I get any new sponsors?
[145:10.36]No new sponsors.
[145:15.41]Training.
[145:16.33]Upgrades.
[145:20.45]I don't have enough.
[145:22.27]What do I need?
[145:24.11]I need better hands.
[145:26.27]No more fumbles.
[145:30.38]Or strength.
[145:34.74]I'm going to say hands.
[145:37.60]Hands and strength.
[145:39.28]I got one.
[145:40.44]Yeah, I got enough.
[145:44.07]It's just hand moisturizer.
[145:46.73]Maybe speed, too.
[145:48.47]No, I'll do strength.
[145:55.02]Alright.
[145:55.90]Guess my training is doing good.
[145:59.72]Assigned training automatically.
[146:06.48]So, what have we got in here?
[146:07.64]I've got two more games to advance.
[146:09.84]Three in alright now.
[146:10.62]$42,000 in the bank.
[146:18.59]And let's see where we're at now.
[146:22.83]I have gained stats.
[146:26.29]Overall is two notches.
[146:28.69]I went up in defense.
[146:32.35]How do you spend 100 grand on hand moisturizer?
[146:36.07]Win by more than 20 points.
[146:40.55]I've done it two games in a row, but that's a lot of money to bet.
[146:44.48]Fuck it.
[146:45.64]The Milwaukee Hounds used to be a bunch of semi-pro misfits.
[146:49.93]But quarterback Conrad Damon has made them the high-caliber team to beat in Division 3.
[146:54.81]Not bad for a guy who drives a military assault vehicle.
[146:58.01]Conrad's got a cannon for an arm and a damn good receiver core.
[147:02.70]Make no mistake, this guy's a deadly bastard.
[147:06.12]So hit him hard and hit him hard.
[147:09.36]Alright.
[147:10.02]Okay.
[147:11.08]Easy there, guy.
[147:30.75]What is this shitty twisted metal reject?
[147:36.37]We have to get rid of him.
[147:37.09]Look at how long his body is.
[147:39.49]He has an exceptionally long body.
[147:43.26]Good evening, everyone.
[147:49.56]So ugly.
[147:50.52]Every time.
[147:51.68]Alright, we gotta go after the quarterback.
[147:58.05]That's the target.
[148:03.50]And that's a fucking touchdown right at the beginning of the game, isn't it?
[148:13.67]So, nobody on their defense is particularly terrifying.
[148:16.63]Ooh, almost!
[148:19.87]Almost!
[148:21.85]That deserves a taunt!
[148:28.20]That deserves a taunt!
[148:29.98]How do I taunt?
[148:32.71]Well, that's a perfect example of why they call him whatever it is they call him.
[148:38.51]That should have been a taunt.
[148:42.83]No, I'm going to go safe.
[148:47.24]He'll go.
[148:52.56]That doesn't matter.
[148:53.82]Three extra points.
[148:55.12]And the extra point is good.
[148:58.00]How's Super Bowl going?
[148:59.22]One minute left.
[148:59.84]Patriots have the ball.
[149:00.58]Fourth and one at LA 24, really.
[149:01.86]I don't know how up-to-date that is.
[149:16.35]There it is.
[149:16.69]Nice dirty hit.
[149:24.80]That was nice.
[149:29.92]So they have an amazing quarterback.
[149:33.34]So I got to be aware of that.
[149:34.26]I got to try to injure him.
[149:34.98]I don't want to do that for safety though.
[149:38.77]Maybe I do.
[149:39.25]He's at 86%.
[149:40.75]And I have an unleashed.
[150:03.07]Field goal for the Patriots.
[150:04.37]Okay.
[150:08.38]Caught that right at the very end.
[150:10.90]So the Rams have one minute to... It's almost impossible, isn't it?
[150:18.68]They're going to have to get a touchdown and then an onside kick.
[150:26.85]Damn.
[150:28.09]Well, it's not impossible, just improbable.
[150:32.78]Ooh, nice interception.
[150:39.25]See you later.
[150:39.75]I did it.
[150:44.69]Am I rooting for Rams?
[150:46.19]I mean, I'm from New England.
[150:47.35]Patriots are the team that I should be rooting for.
[151:02.08]So, I don't know.
[151:04.22]Yeah, but... Right in the fucking head.
[151:11.42]Cox chugged all the frames.
[151:13.60]Oh, geez.
[151:35.63]I don't know what that was.
[151:38.85]What did I just hurt?
[151:45.47]Broken rib.
[151:46.57]You're up with two plays.
[151:50.65]That's it.
[151:51.53]See ya.
[151:52.13]See ya in like two and a half minutes.
[151:54.69]No gain.
[151:55.35]Only three yards.
[152:08.29]Yeah, he just broke a few ribs.
[152:09.65]Get in there.
[152:13.03]Who are you?
[152:19.18]Oh!
[152:21.72]Not only is that illegal, but that's how you find yourself in a jail cell.
[152:31.46]Let's go back to balance.
[152:32.24]He's gonna be throwing it.
[152:33.35]Alright, you're alright.
[152:34.29]Let me see.
[152:34.65]Good?
[152:35.37]You good to go?
[152:36.89]Go get him!
[152:38.68]actually illegal.
[152:50.29]No, he's still going.
[152:51.57]I almost had it too.
[152:53.30]He's close.
[152:53.68]Stop him here.
[153:11.60]Stuff him.
[153:13.00]Don't give him a chance.
[153:13.94]Ah.
[153:14.16]They got one more?
[153:14.82]Tom Brady just grew an extra finger to put on his sixth ring.
[153:19.64]Is it actually over?
[153:40.71]Damn it!
[153:41.09]Ah, what was I trying to do there?
[153:42.91]Sorry.
[153:46.29]No, it's not time yet.
[153:48.00]I'm still streaming.
[153:50.20]My Super Bowl's not over yet.
[153:52.44]What the heck?
[153:53.96]My eight-foot sub, cater order, didn't even get here yet.
[154:14.33]Holy shit, you fucked up bad.
[154:15.67]Patriots win in eight seconds.
[154:24.94]Okay, I don't even wanna hear that kind of, what the hell are you saying?
[154:32.74]The deep pass.
[154:35.65]And it's complete at the seven yard line.
[154:42.57]Hurt him.
[154:44.31]No injury there, but I got him.
[154:48.83]Oh, the signature.
[154:50.89]Look at me walk.
[155:19.54]Uh-oh.
[155:23.40]Nope.
[155:23.78]I thought it was... I thought it was something else.
[155:27.65]We still have not seen the worst one.
[155:29.67]Which is the... Thank God he's up now.
[155:50.24]It was prevent.
[155:51.04]Prevent.
[155:51.46]Deep zones.
[155:52.98]He passes all the time.
[155:56.00]That's not what I call prevention.
[156:04.93]That's not prevention.
[156:11.90]So that's it.
[156:12.52]Patriots win the Super Bowl.
[156:19.75]That's it.
[156:21.41]The New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl for the tenth time in a row.
[156:28.13]There it is.
[156:30.35]They did it.
[156:31.23]I can't believe they did it.
[156:50.13]but yeah it's congratulations to Tom Brady you can now you essentially now Tom Brady is when Tom Brady eventually like dies like in 50 years he's won so many Super Bowls they're gonna like Futurama him he'll be doing like press conferences still
[157:21.67]Oh, that would hit.
[157:27.41]Got it.
[157:31.16]Oh.
[157:31.30]He fell down and turned his frayed off.
[157:33.38]No.
[157:34.08]No, that was me.
[157:35.18]Oh, shit.
[157:35.74]That's bad.
[157:39.10]Penn's damn at a loss.
[157:40.34]That sucks.
[157:52.39]First down, 30 yards to go.
[157:53.41]Alright, we both have unleashed.
[157:58.48]Heaves it deep.
[158:00.30]Out of bounds at the 47-yard line.
[158:02.04]Did I catch it?
[158:03.00]I actually caught it.
[158:03.58]Hold on.
[158:06.40]I don't think I caught that.
[158:07.14]I think I caught that out of bounds.
[158:09.36]I can't do, like, slow motion?
[158:16.10]There's one foot.
[158:17.96]Nope.
[158:19.46]Whatever, it's in my favor.
[158:20.24]I don't care.
[158:27.21]Brady now has the final stone for his bomb.
[158:30.60]Yeah, you guys, everyone should be concerned about this.
[158:32.28]Oh, look at me!
[158:36.76]Look at me!
[158:45.12]Las Vegas tears up a good chunk of field there.
[158:47.64]I thought I was going to get really hurt.
[158:50.36]Okay.
[158:51.23]First and goal.
[158:52.09]It's gut check time.
[158:54.95]Oh, shit.
[158:59.27]Stop pausing!
[159:00.21]And so, at halftime, Las Vegas leads by 16.
[159:16.61]They're alright for the YouTuber scream, I'm sorry.
[159:28.54]He's gone for like the rest of the year.
[159:30.88]It's always the Spleen, you're gone forever.
[159:35.31]See you in eight games, the whole season.
[159:40.98]That's what you get for making me lose and be stupid and taunt you.
[159:46.91]That's what you get for me taunting you.
[159:48.43]I gotta get in there and get that quarterback.
[159:55.70]I gotta get in there.
[160:11.00]He recovered from the concussion.
[160:11.90]I almost got it.
[160:12.42]We'll do Spy Man.
[160:13.02]One more good, dirty hit.
[160:14.02]And I'll have enough to try to take up some time.
[160:41.30]My guy just stopped moving.
[160:42.96]Oh, fuck the button.
[160:55.41]Oh, stay up, stay up!
[161:03.59]He used some great moves to make guys miss on that run.
[161:10.68]What about the sling?
[161:11.44]Let's go with the sling.
[161:14.18]I don't... I'm not going to use my unleash here.
[161:16.00]Give me a cut!
[161:19.81]Give me a cut!
[161:20.91]There he is.
[161:21.97]Oh, one of these codes isn't right.
[161:24.21]Let's go for a bolt.
[161:25.47]Bolt pass.
[161:26.25]Cut right.
[161:43.12]What an unbelievable catch, but not good enough.
[161:46.64]Dammit.
[161:47.61]He's gonna come back and haunt me.
[161:53.83]The crowd is Twitch chat?
[161:56.75]Yeah, I can see that.
[162:02.66]How did you not catch that?
[162:05.34]Honest to god.
[162:06.62]How did you not get that?
[162:14.02]Where was this guy going?
[162:16.78]Beautiful move.
[162:17.92]Into a fumble.
[162:21.55]Why did he run that way?
[162:22.83]I ran him that way.
[162:23.91]Fuck me.
[162:24.43]Not this time.
[162:25.61]How the fuck... This quarterback is too good.
[162:30.29]I have to win by 20 points.
[162:31.57]Currently doing not terrible.
[162:49.04]What if Jerma was one of us?
[162:52.78]What does that mean?
[163:02.39]The Super Bowls are gonna win.
[163:03.57]I can't believe the Patriots won the Super Bowl again.
[163:14.94]Howie!
[163:15.34]Why would you run into bounds there?
[163:21.41]There's no reason for you to run out of bounds.
[163:23.48]You had an opportunity to run.
[163:24.44]Damn.
[163:24.62]Turnover on downs.
[163:25.14]Didn't get it.
[163:25.46]Third.
[163:25.58]Alright.
[163:25.78]It's my opportunity to make it.
[163:28.48]My $15,000 bet.
[163:28.88]Let's run it.
[163:29.38]I'll take it.
[163:52.49]Is this game online, or is he playing against himself?
[163:55.03]I'm just playing against myself.
[163:55.69]I don't think... This is an old PlayStation 3 game.
[163:57.59]What's the League 2?
[163:58.29]It is... This was definitely one of the best.
[163:59.47]Sit down with, like, a buddy, and just shit-talk each other and play again.
[164:19.13]The defender gets a hand on it, and it's incomplete.
[164:21.53]He's down with a buddy.
[164:23.85]It's inbounds, right?
[164:26.73]Alright.
[164:26.97]Here it is.
[164:27.33]Red zone.
[164:27.89]We're going to go run right up the middle.
[164:29.13]He's going to power from the middle.
[164:33.73]Oh!
[164:34.03]Did I lose yards?
[164:49.68]I don't like that fight here, though.
[164:53.38]Again.
[164:53.62]Man, I got a big bet riding on this.
[164:57.54]This field goal.
[164:58.46]I want to keep my own leash.
[165:20.88]Good.
[165:26.11]Just gotta hold him.
[165:32.37]Jeremiah, I was there when Rage quit Jets at radio.
[165:35.84]Were you there when I exploded the guy's balls?
[165:39.28]Looks like a fumble.
[165:41.04]Las Vegas has the football.
[165:46.15]It didn't happen, but... 44.
[165:48.09]I'm struggling with now.
[165:50.25]This is not even a contest anymore.
[166:16.14]He's very injured, too.
[166:17.16]Look at this guy.
[166:18.94]This guy's in pain.
[166:22.02]Oh, wrong guy.
[166:23.66]He's the guy standing next to him.
[166:26.66]More like dumb.
[166:30.03]That one's already been used.
[166:33.65]Alright.
[166:34.33]I got an unleash.
[166:35.17]Let's take the quarterback out of the game.
[166:37.21]And out of the seat.
[166:39.88]Oh!
[166:42.06]And now I'm in...
[166:47.82]about it touchdown Milwaukee I'm telling you there's like eight jock strips out there in the football field right now it's a defense might want to leave them out there and hope somebody will trip over or at least pick them up and get them washed yeah you got you get a little prize you got 13 points good for you get it I'm caring so much about trying to kill the quarterback dude what the hell kind of route were you running there
[167:16.99]Just turn off the announcer.
[167:22.19]Do you really want me to turn him off?
[167:25.53]It's alright.
[167:30.22]He was resilient.
[167:33.20]Okay, our new mantra is run the ball, burn the clock.
[167:36.90]Yeah, run the ball, burn the clock.
[167:38.48]Oh.
[167:50.79]I punched him so hard in the face.
[167:51.95]Oh, look at me!
[167:58.79]Touchdown!
[167:59.53]I punched him so bad that I... Very nice run.
[168:03.29]His legs never stop moving and his eyes never stop looking for daylight.
[168:08.84]Let's go to the pass.
[168:10.14]I have 50 points left.
[168:14.12]And they can't convert.
[168:23.70]Well, I thought it was going to be circle, whatever.
[168:26.60]Look, when you're up by 50 points, you kind of just... Can I take out my starters?
[168:36.28]Let's go with, uh... Uh... The PS, my controller turned off.
[168:43.13]Is that a battery?
[168:44.51]I need a battery right now.
[168:48.05]The offense looking at first and 30.
[168:49.55]I mean, I'll plug.
[169:00.79]This thing fits, right?
[169:01.63]It does?
[169:12.26]Now where's the USB?
[169:13.12]It's right here.
[169:14.96]The offense has a ways to go here on second down.
[169:18.60]How do you get the USB in here?
[169:21.68]318.
[169:21.70]318.
[169:21.78]How do I plug it in?
[169:26.29]Alright, I'm plugged back in.
[169:28.62]We're good, I think.
[169:34.06]It's just blinking.
[169:38.25]How do I do this?
[169:42.39]Why isn't it just sinking?
[169:44.29]Why does it have to sink?
[169:44.97]Got it!
[169:49.48]Okay, it's back, it's back.
[169:59.63]Hey, yeah, that's not fair.
[170:00.95]That's fine.
[170:01.51]Yeah.
[170:02.83]You get to play against a non-opponent for a minute.
[170:17.31]What?
[170:19.77]I intercepted the ball?
[170:21.19]Did he throw it in?
[170:28.20]I don't...
[170:33.33]No.
[170:34.21]I wish I could slow this down.
[170:36.99]There's no way to slow it down, huh?
[170:41.53]I don't know.
[170:46.69]Nice work.
[170:55.02]Alright, let's just throw an end zone pass.
[170:58.86]See if I can get to 58 points.
[171:08.17]He lets it fly!
[171:11.38]He's got it!
[171:11.90]And he's in the end zone!
[171:17.08]You're on code again.
[171:18.04]58 points, let's get it.
[171:20.83]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[171:28.35]And they can't come out.
[171:29.05]What?
[171:30.18]Awww.
[171:49.50]This poor guy.
[171:50.74]56-21, I want my bet.
[171:52.08]So the wrong code joke isn't a joke.
[171:56.52]No, I'm just trying to find other codes.
[172:01.41]I'm just doing random buttons to try to find other codes.
[172:04.79]Because there's a shitload of them.
[172:07.37]Alright, I'm going to get a lot of money.
[172:10.39]I had a lot of points, a lot of dirty hits, a lot of flashes.
[172:14.78]Touchdowns.
[172:17.99]yeah 400 grand uh I got some movies very cool what's my sweat like but I'm not I'm fine we're about to make it into the the next we're about to win
[172:38.76]Agent.
[172:39.44]There I am.
[172:39.86]Okay, I gotta score at least three touchdowns against Detroit.
[172:43.08]No new sponsors.
[173:09.72]Training.
[173:10.35]Let's take a look.
[173:12.41]I want to take a look at how everybody's doing, too.
[173:14.21]So I got 400 grand.
[173:16.55]Resist injury is probably a good idea.
[173:18.41]Speed.
[173:18.95]Hmm.
[173:28.82]Maybe passing.
[173:33.52]Grip master.
[173:34.70]More strength.
[173:38.27]Hmm.
[173:38.55]I'm going to do speed.
[173:40.46]Speed and... Speed and passing.
[173:47.46]I might be able to do one more.
[173:49.44]And resist injury.
[173:53.16]Big spender.
[173:53.84]Alright, so we're doing alright.
[173:56.44]75 tackle.
[173:59.56]People are ranking up.
[174:08.08]Oh, I have to actually, okay, train the attributes now.
[174:10.98]So I won't, this is me.
[174:14.32]Oh, no, no, I gotta set it to automatic.
[174:18.09]It's on automatic, isn't it?
[174:24.39]Pass and kick plus five.
[174:28.11]Hands, strength.
[174:30.11]Brake tackle is so bad.
[174:39.78]Yeah, just keep it there.
[174:42.52]That's fine.
[174:43.12]Yeah, it is doing it.
[174:43.74]It's doing it automatically.
[174:45.14]I see.
[174:46.08]Okay, we're good.
[174:48.29]How about drugs?
[174:50.55]I got 50 grand.
[174:51.65]Let's go with turbo bar.
[174:53.89]Reduce the turbo bar drain.
[174:55.41]Let's reduce the stamina loss.
[175:05.40]Let's also give this again.
[175:09.30]Turbo bar to the halfback.
[175:10.82]I don't want to get arrested, so I'm going to keep it like that.
[175:16.94]Although, let's go to defense.
[175:17.86]No, no, no, no.
[175:23.03]I'm going to get in trouble.
[175:25.25]Alright, let's go.
[175:27.03]This is the Detroit Devils.
[175:28.91]4-0.
[175:36.27]Las Vegas must win by more than 23 points.
[175:41.14]max bet this week we've got the Detroit devils once upon a time this was a pretty good team but there's a cancer in that locker room and his name is cookie wallace cookie on a good day cookie is one of the best receivers in the game receiver thing is he ain't having as many good days as he used to and of course he blames everyone else for his screw-ups the team sucks but he's
[176:11.68]I don't understand.
[176:14.08]So maybe I should leave him in the game.
[176:18.18]Should I just not try to hurt him?
[176:21.22]If the team sucks when he's on it, I should leave him be.
[176:30.07]Selfish and undisciplined.
[176:33.57]Okay.
[176:40.17]Go after everyone else.
[176:40.90]There you go.
[176:41.34]Come on.
[176:41.60]Why does that keep happening?
[176:42.78]Okay, whoever that is.
[176:43.38]82?
[176:43.40]Fuck you, 82.
[176:43.62]That was ridiculous.
[176:44.38]Come on now.
[177:13.67]That's a neck tweak.
[177:17.40]That's Robbie.
[177:21.44]That guy's on drugs too.
[177:22.84]I gotta get him back in.
[177:23.70]Look at the run in the background.
[177:25.30]I gotta make this good.
[177:27.14]That's alright.
[177:27.62]That's three plays and one stamina boost.
[177:30.88]Alright, this team is kind of hurting me.
[177:44.03]Play smart.
[177:44.49]I'm not doing any running plays.
[177:47.21]I don't have my hat back.
[177:48.09]And he's the one on drugs.
[177:49.55]I've got to keep him okay.
[177:50.83]Cut it.
[177:51.11]Cut it.
[177:51.35]Somebody cut it!
[177:52.45]Alright.
[177:53.19]I've got to run.
[177:53.77]I have to.
[177:54.11]I'm going to do a QB sneak.
[177:54.93]Okay.
[178:12.37]I'm just running.
[178:12.77]I'm going to walk over the... I'm walking over the line right now.
[178:14.69]3, 2, 1, go.
[178:14.91]God damn it.
[178:15.29]It's alright.
[178:15.85]It's because my halfback got hurt.
[178:18.04]I would have ran in with the halfback.
[178:43.99]kill somebody already.
[178:45.69]I got killed.
[178:48.51]My guy was injured.
[178:49.53]I... Guys.
[179:00.01]I had an opportunity, but it's okay.
[179:02.08]As long as I keep him.
[179:03.46]Third down.
[179:06.48]Let's do some zones here.
[179:08.92]Slot 34!
[179:09.18]Slot 34!
[179:09.44]Slot 34!
[179:15.30]Oh damn it, he unleashed to catch it.
[179:17.04]It's a free catch if you unleash.
[179:21.11]Goddamn halfback got injured in the first play.
[179:23.71]And then I fumbled the ball.
[179:27.07]It's still early.
[179:41.37]Is Vegas falling from grace?
[179:44.06]No, not yet.
[179:46.17]I'll take it back here.
[179:47.39]I'm going to get my halfback.
[179:48.45]He's going to come back.
[179:51.03]This is the turnaround rider.
[179:53.53]They're pretty rough.
[179:56.25]There he is.
[179:56.63]Bobby's back.
[179:56.93]Next play.
[180:18.03]There it is.
[180:18.47]Let's bring it back.
[180:19.43]Don't taunt.
[180:20.33]Just score the fucking touchdown.
[180:21.81]I gotta take the lead.
[180:25.53]Let's go.
[180:26.05]Take the lead.
[180:27.09]Yes!
[180:27.23]Cross the plane.
[180:49.55]Look up codes.
[180:50.57]Uh, I mean, I'm... Oh, no.
[180:54.60]Oh, no.
[180:55.38]Oh, no.
[180:57.24]No.
[181:00.16]Look up codes.
[181:00.80]I was looking at chat.
[181:03.54]Touchdown.
[181:04.60]Cookie Wallace finds the end zone once again.
[181:14.81]I just need to...
[181:21.25]I gotta kill Cookie, I know!
[181:22.91]There's gonna be a back-and-forth here, and all I need is a touchdown.
[181:30.59]I got two.
[181:31.15]They didn't get a two-point conversion.
[181:32.27]I did.
[181:39.06]I had it.
[181:41.62]Alright, they got an Unleash.
[181:44.16]I'm about to have one.
[181:49.27]I gotta, I gotta run out.
[181:50.27]I gotta pass and run out of bounds.
[181:51.91]I have to get that.
[181:53.13]Otherwise I'm gonna get fumbled again.
[181:54.39]Let's hug the right side.
[182:14.56]Stay!
[182:15.08]No!
[182:15.54]Out of bounds, please!
[182:19.83]Yeah!
[182:24.30]Yes.
[182:24.46]Wow, that was lucky.
[182:29.18]Aren't you guys motioning up your hands?
[182:30.80]I need to upgrade the hands.
[182:32.82]It's bad.
[182:34.26]It's very bad.
[182:35.30]I need to upgrade hands.
[182:37.07]First and goal.
[182:37.91]It's gut check time.
[182:39.09]Ball at the 22-yard line.
[182:44.21]Goes way downfield.
[182:45.71]He's got it.
[182:46.09]Touchdown.
[182:46.65]Touchdown.
[182:57.48]So I have an unleash.
[182:58.53]It's tied up.
[183:00.55]Oh, should I be safe?
[183:01.75]Okay, we got the set.
[183:03.71]We're picking up the trail and we'll track them like the dogs they are.
[183:23.84]Okay, tie game.
[183:27.20]Injury time.
[183:30.43]No, I wanted to select it, but I couldn't get it.
[183:37.41]Cycles through like everybody on the team.
[183:40.49]Here we go.
[183:42.07]No, let me hit him.
[183:44.61]Let me hit him.
[183:45.79]Stop getting in my way.
[183:47.03]23, zoo!
[183:47.69]23, zoo!
[183:59.70]Did that just happen?
[184:00.62]Did that just happen?
[184:01.86]I can't believe it.
[184:02.40]Ah, or injury, heart.
[184:03.02]Oh, man!
[184:03.22]If they would just get out of my way and let me tackle them, I would have tackled them two plays ago.
[184:33.44]He was right in my line of sight.
[184:34.90]I haven't unleashed and some guy bumped into him.
[184:36.90]You're making this hard for me, guys.
[184:40.21]Get out of my fucking way.
[184:41.23]I'm the captain.
[184:41.85]I say what I say goes.
[184:43.03]Who gets the ball?
[184:56.82]Oh.
[185:01.36]Oh, man.
[185:01.90]He got tattooed.
[185:04.69]You got the smelling salts?
[185:05.93]Yeah, yeah.
[185:06.85]Hold on.
[185:07.37]You know what?
[185:07.67]Never mind.
[185:08.03]Let's just get the cart out here.
[185:09.09]That's a good idea.
[185:10.27]Yeah, bring it out.
[185:14.34]Oh, no.
[185:15.78]Oh, that's not good.
[185:17.12]That's not good.
[185:21.12]Actually dead.
[185:23.66]Oh, God.
[185:24.68]This is not going well.
[185:26.22]Two unleashed just ran into each other.
[185:29.54]That's what happens.
[185:35.64]Get over that first down.
[185:36.50]Did you get it?
[185:37.56]No, that's not what I said.
[185:39.60]I said if it was up to me.
[185:45.80]It's not.
[185:46.08]The offense is looking at third and short.
[186:08.51]We're doing alright.
[186:09.23]Everything's going fine.
[186:09.95]Let's try to run it.
[186:19.78]Who wins in the Unleash fight?
[186:22.64]Who wins?
[186:25.12]Time out.
[186:25.60]Time out.
[186:29.93]I still have my Unleash.
[186:35.47]I gotta...
[186:41.14]That was an unleashed catch.
[186:43.18]It's supposed to be guaranteed.
[186:45.80]Alright.
[186:46.02]Injured!
[187:07.62]Injury!
[187:08.32]Oh no!
[187:09.90]Why?
[187:10.34]It's not fair!
[187:11.70]Kill it!
[187:14.26]Brake is back!
[187:16.87]Yes!
[187:18.41]He's too good!
[187:19.49]Get rid of him!
[187:21.91]Oh my god!
[187:26.61]Cookie has made every single play.
[187:28.48]He's made every single touchdown.
[187:30.84]Not anymore.
[187:31.86]You're out.
[187:39.06]Detroit had everyone on the same page there, and they are rewarded with a very nice game.
[187:44.10]They only have five plays.
[187:46.82]Sorry, that's an entire... I'm so amped up right now.
[187:57.27]I gotta win.
[187:57.85]I gotta go 5-0.
[188:00.01]I just fucked it up.
[188:02.87]Ooh, the receiver's taken out of the play, and that's incomplete.
[188:09.36]He falls in.
[188:09.78]There's my guy.
[188:17.00]Could you just seriously let him get by you?
[188:21.50]How could you let him?
[188:22.88]You were holding onto him.
[188:27.14]How did you let that happen?
[188:29.21]You tackled him, and he just walked off.
[188:33.33]This team's training.
[188:35.37]Yeah, I'm going to fucking close the door on this.
[188:39.94]These idiots can't do anything on defense.
[188:41.58]First and 30.
[188:42.11]Ball at the 41-yard line.
[189:06.91]too early I'm just like pissed off at like cookie whatever his name is it's alright keep it going let's run it
[189:37.68]How have I not found a random soda?
[189:44.13]Okay, I need this two-point conversion.
[189:45.83]I need it bad.
[189:47.21]Very, very badly.
[189:48.28]Very badly.
[189:50.76]Let's go.
[189:51.10]Oh, you...
[190:14.35]Cookie, hurt him.
[190:15.05]He's back in.
[190:15.65]He's injured.
[190:16.49]Make it work.
[190:16.91]Make it happen.
[190:19.17]Look at that stamina.
[190:21.73]It's terrible.
[190:22.67]And I have a... I'm gonna... Let's go for him again.
[190:27.72]Anticipate.
[190:29.22]Cookie's coming over here.
[190:33.52]There he is.
[190:33.86]Nice try.
[190:35.78]That was like a ballet move.
[190:46.38]That was a big sack.
[190:47.12]It's third and 39.
[190:48.64]We're gonna play cover.
[190:49.47]Man up.
[190:49.95]In the zones.
[190:51.61]There's no way you're gonna get 40 goddamn yards there.
[190:52.79]See you later.
[190:53.15]My ball.
[190:53.39]Fourth and 26.
[190:53.85]They're definitely gonna punt.
[191:19.57]And I've got him on leash.
[191:25.01]Snap the damn ball.
[191:39.78]Now I need a two-point conversion.
[191:43.43]Yeah, I do.
[191:45.41]I do now.
[191:51.42]Hit the ground again.
[191:54.44]Can you explain to me how, during an unleash, this guy is able to dirty hit me still?
[192:00.12]Alright, I gotta make the plays here.
[192:04.96]Let's go for a run.
[192:24.01]Oh, no, no!
[192:27.65]No!
[192:28.07]I'm interring my Unleash.
[192:30.16]My Unleash, why does it get stopped every time?
[192:37.20]Hold on, buddy.
[192:38.78]Yeah, get the cart out.
[192:39.46]That was a default.
[192:40.78]Take it easy, buddy.
[192:41.44]Oh, fuck.
[192:42.06]Be over in a second.
[192:43.84]That guy did a default tackle, and I'm in a goddamn... I can't even believe it.
[192:49.91]It's okay.
[192:50.17]I hate to say it, but I've been wanting to hit him like that since the beginning of camp.
[192:54.01]Offense with a long way to go here on third down.
[193:00.65]Looking for the big play.
[193:07.99]This is it.
[193:08.81]I gotta get that fucking ball back.
[193:54.41]Yes!
[193:56.53]Oh yes!
[193:57.83]I'm so involved.
[194:00.01]Done.
[194:00.67]Out for the season.
[194:01.39]Okay, I gotta get this ball back.
[194:02.75]I'm getting too amped up over this game.
[194:04.65]First and goal.
[194:16.11]I have to stop him right now.
[194:17.77]They can't get a touchdown.
[194:20.19]Stay back.
[194:26.78]Get that fucking ball!
[194:27.90]Fumble it!
[194:32.86]I gotta unleash.
[194:33.44]I have to use it somehow.
[194:35.40]Just pass into the end zone if there's... I gotta activate it.
[194:40.67]And try to catch it.
[194:44.37]There it is.
[194:44.87]Fumble it.
[194:48.91]How on Earth did you not recover the fumble?
[194:52.29]Oh, that's unbelievable.
[194:53.39]I can't... How?
[194:55.17]Those three of you running around in a circle around him.
[194:57.95]Pick it up.
[194:59.32]The offense might want to mix it up here.
[195:00.98]They've been a little predictable the first two downs.
[195:09.94]Runs it left side.
[195:12.22]Sheds a tackle.
[195:14.04]He's out of bounds.
[195:15.01]Alright.
[195:15.37]One yard line.
[195:23.22]Don't let him run up the middle This is bad though, this is very bad
[195:40.03]I'm in my own end zone.
[195:44.77]I gotta get out of my own end zone now.
[195:46.45]I got two timeouts.
[195:48.65]Oh, shit.
[195:49.21]I have no meter.
[195:51.06]Back to pass.
[195:53.28]The throw.
[195:55.08]Complete at the 26-yard line.
[195:57.34]Franchise.
[195:58.36]Oh, that's okay.
[195:58.88]Over 300 yards on the day.
[196:10.29]He fades back, launches it.
[196:17.15]The 38-yard line, and the big hit brings him down.
[196:20.27]Las Vegas exploits an opening of the defense for some real yards on that play.
[196:24.62]First down, 20 yards to go.
[196:26.22]He'll look to throw.
[196:31.60]Heaves it deep.
[196:42.64]Yes!
[196:44.04]Okay, just kick it.
[196:48.20]Oh, I'm so excited.
[196:50.52]I'm so happy.
[196:51.90]I'm gonna be undefeated.
[196:56.31]I'm getting way too invested in this.
[196:59.61]They got one attempt here.
[197:03.17]They have to run it back for a touchdown right now.
[197:05.49]They don't have a meter.
[197:08.71]Just play smart.
[197:11.18]Goodbye.
[197:11.46]I win.
[197:11.62]Goddamn.
[197:12.12]Ugh.
[197:12.80]I felt that one in my bones.
[197:38.06]I didn't cause a turnover at all.
[197:40.76]I lost the wager, it's alright.
[197:43.88]I just happen to be undefeated.
[197:48.30]That was better than the actual Super Bowl.
[197:56.14]Killed a man and won the game.
[197:57.48]Alright, we got a call.
[198:00.31]Hey there.
[198:01.35]I just got off the phone with the sponsors.
[198:03.17]They love what they saw during the commercial shoot.
[198:06.01]We did a little negotiating and they're throwing in some additional gear for your team.
[198:10.37]You can thank me later.
[198:14.45]Was killing a man worth that money?
[198:16.88]Oh, God.
[198:17.24]So I have to get a gain of 50-plus yards on a single play.
[198:19.44]Currently 5-0.
[198:44.95]Against the Crusaders.
[198:45.89]Let's see what we got for sponsors.
[198:50.46]Impact.
[198:51.58]Ooh.
[198:54.06]+2 tackle, +2 break tackle.
[198:56.76]+2 hands, +2 speed.
[199:01.20]Alright, cool.
[199:01.68]Exclusive sponsor equipment.
[199:05.22]Upgrades.
[199:08.10]Hands.
[199:08.34]280.
[199:08.36]I don't have enough money.
[199:10.39]Damn it.
[199:17.35]Do I just hold on to the money?
[199:21.71]What can I do?
[199:24.29]I can do blocking.
[199:26.33]Probably need it.
[199:29.09]Resist injury.
[199:30.96]Turbo jets inside of the massage pool.
[199:38.40]Agility, maybe.
[199:39.18]I'm going to hold on to the money.
[199:48.47]Agility.
[199:49.05]Block.
[199:49.79]No.
[199:50.03]Block.
[199:52.69]Yeah.
[199:53.15]Get everything to one.
[199:53.79]That's not a bad idea.
[199:54.53]Alright.
[199:56.21]What about drugs?
[199:56.83]What can I take for drugs?
[199:57.99]Okay.
[199:58.57]I just accidentally took them.
[200:00.17]I don't even know what they are.
[200:01.89]What are those?
[200:03.16]I don't know.
[200:05.78]I just took a handful of random drugs and I don't know what they do.
[200:13.71]okay uh five and oh I got five grand versus Cincinnati crusaders alright I don't know after that last one I can't believe I gotta get my shit together right uh let me take a piss and grab another coke I'll be right back
[200:42.78]Everyone says, again?
[200:43.56]Yeah, I slammed that last Coke and now I gotta pee it out.
[203:02.58]I just realized something.
[203:06.54]Holy shit, is it a good time to be a Boston sports fan.
[203:09.44]The Red Sox just won the World Series.
[203:11.44]Patriots just won the Super Bowl.
[203:14.54]Wow.
[203:15.08]I just realized that right now.
[203:21.41]Let me know you didn't.
[203:24.69]What?
[203:26.74]Well, I mean, am I just realizing this?
[203:29.24]Yeah, because the Patriots just like 40 minutes ago won the Super Bowl.
[203:36.16]It's better to be a Las Vegas fan.
[203:37.56]Well, not yet.
[203:39.06]Not yet.
[203:44.22]Not till like 2020.
[203:45.06]But let's go.
[203:49.14]The Cincinnati Crusaders.
[203:55.15]Must have been by more than 15 points.
[203:56.71]I don't even have any... No, no bet.
[203:58.23]I don't have any fucking money.
[203:59.14]This team's terrible.
[204:00.74]They're 1-4.
[204:01.12]They're going to go up against the Las Vegas... What's the team name?
[204:07.52]I forget.
[204:08.95]We're playing the Cincinnati Crusaders this week.
[204:11.91]Hallelujah.
[204:14.35]Their best player by far is free safety Ezekiel Freeman.
[204:20.74]Ezekiel could be playing Division 1 ball, but he claims God told him to be a crusader.
[204:26.98]Come Sunday morning, he's reveling in the good book.
[204:29.82]Sunday afternoon, he raises hell.
[204:35.45]Okay.
[204:36.85]So he's a safety?
[204:43.79]Are you waiting for the Raiders?
[204:47.29]No, not particularly.
[204:49.64]It's going to be really interesting.
[204:56.15]But I'm more of a baseball fan than I am a football fan.
[205:02.67]So if Las Vegas gets itself a Las Vegas baseball team, I'll be very, very excited.
[205:08.60]Alright, I have to make a 50-yard play.
[205:21.54]That'll count for 50 yards, I think.
[205:23.19]Oh, there he is.
[205:23.93]The Crusader himself.
[205:25.71]Just shut it down.
[205:26.63]God, come on.
[205:30.85]He was a lightning bolt.
[205:31.85]That was ridiculous.
[205:35.75]That was so fast.
[205:36.90]Where is he?
[205:37.62]Top left.
[205:37.90]He's the safety over there.
[205:44.86]Get yardage.
[205:51.32]Hey!
[205:51.98]I'm supposed to do that.
[205:55.70]I gotta get away from that safety.
[205:56.96]Let's go... Let's go to the shimmy.
[205:59.26]Two blockers on the right.
[206:01.02]Try to go right between them.
[206:02.40]Well, if you were there, that would've been a great run.
[206:09.15]But you weren't there.
[206:09.79]You were supposed to be blocking that guy.
[206:13.71]Nine yards to go.
[206:14.83]Let's see if we can get a hook.
[206:19.38]He's so fucking fast.
[206:23.96]Check out the altitude on that catch.
[206:26.36]Las Vegas exploits an opening in the defense for some real yardage on that play.
[206:32.26]Let's go for a run.
[206:34.00]Jimmy, give me a ride again.
[206:35.02]I just gotta make a call.
[206:39.79]I was going to go for a juke, didn't get it.
[206:47.09]Same deal.
[206:49.37]Let's go right in the middle.
[206:50.73]No, right here.
[206:52.15]Just go across.
[206:56.56]Oh, shit.
[206:57.82]I got stuffed.
[206:59.58]I just got stuffed.
[207:03.52]Third down and goal to go.
[207:12.64]No two-point diversion, just get the field goal.
[207:15.86]As he gets Brent Caliendo in a booth, tell him to do every John Madden stumble he's ever done.
[207:37.90]Actual VF.
[207:41.22]Dirty hit.
[207:42.04]Alright.
[207:45.52]Keep the defense up.
[207:48.76]Walk it down.
[207:49.48]He's not on offense.
[207:51.36]So don't have to worry about it here.
[207:58.55]Good play.
[207:59.29]What is that commentary?
[208:01.51]I have...
[208:08.76]It is very odd.
[208:12.42]Oh, let's stay back.
[208:14.95]I feel like you're going for a pass play.
[208:17.01]And you are.
[208:17.71]Magnetized to his back.
[208:18.79]Third down.
[208:19.55]You know what?
[208:21.67]Just blitz him.
[208:22.29]Get it.
[208:22.69]Get it.
[208:40.08]No, what a play they did to me.
[208:44.22]Cincinnati gets some monster yardage on that play.
[208:47.62]First down, Cincinnati.
[208:49.42]The offense in solid field position here inside the red zone.
[208:53.08]It's okay.
[208:53.48]Knocked down.
[208:58.25]Second down.
[208:58.93]Round 80.
[209:00.69]We got Bosa.
[209:02.13]Round 80.
[209:10.99]There it is.
[209:11.41]Broken neck.
[209:12.67]What did I do?
[209:15.55]No.
[209:15.67]He just kind of bent it.
[209:26.96]That was a little more than I thought.
[209:28.08]That was a helmet to skull.
[209:33.32]Six play of this drive Wow I was there I made the right play watch this Huh If the arm on this young man not to mention the accuracy I
[210:04.51]And the extra point is good.
[210:06.07]And that ties it up.
[210:09.28]Jesus said so.
[210:14.72]Nobody's got an unleashed meter, so... Should be good.
[210:21.83]That was your first mistake.
[210:27.01]Still got me.
[210:30.01]Son of a bitch!
[210:39.34]Out of the way.
[210:41.13]Just make it there.
[210:42.15]You got it.
[210:43.53]Don't do any taunting.
[210:45.71]Just get it.
[210:55.09]No, I'm not.
[210:57.04]Just get it.
[210:58.20]Stay ahead.
[211:04.12]I think he's blocked it.
[211:05.30]Is that a new sponsor?
[211:07.14]Did I get the 50 yards?
[211:10.37]I think I did, right?
[211:23.86]He's gonna have a meter in a second.
[211:26.14]So am I, though.
[211:30.22]This guy's back in the game.
[211:39.77]No, don't let him in there.
[211:40.81]Knock him down.
[211:43.99]Oh, the fluid.
[211:51.34]That frog fin.
[211:53.36]That was a frog.
[211:56.68]That wasn't even a person.
[212:00.94]And that wasn't even an Unleash.
[212:01.97]I still have one.
[212:11.14]Interception.
[212:13.11]Perfect.
[212:13.71]Turn it around.
[212:14.17]Watch this.
[212:15.29]Bingo.
[212:21.19]I still have an unleash.
[212:22.49]I still have an unleash.
[212:23.43]I'm not going to use it.
[212:46.39]Oh, come on.
[212:53.36]What happened here?
[212:54.26]I didn't want to throw in a square.
[212:59.08]What the fuck?
[213:05.22]Oh, well.
[213:05.62]It's OK.
[213:05.88]It's still up.
[213:06.42]I still have an unleash.
[213:07.58]I'll get it back right now.
[213:13.83]Give me that ball back.
[213:16.55]Damn it.
[213:22.48]I'm on the clock out.
[213:28.20]Watch this guy on the left.
[213:29.74]This guy's coming up.
[213:42.86]How many does it take?
[213:43.62]You're going to have to do a timeout.
[213:46.70]I don't see a timeout.
[213:47.51]Do you have any timeouts?
[213:48.93]I'll take it.
[213:50.39]One second.
[213:51.21]Give me a break.
[213:54.79]And with the first half of the books, Las Vegas leads by seven.
[213:58.45]Why would you not do a timeout here?
[214:01.52]Did they not have any timeouts?
[214:06.46]Oh, you just gave yourself worse position than with the ball.
[214:11.69]Unless he activates his thing.
[214:14.37]Which he just did.
[214:14.97]Okay, this is not good.
[214:21.44]That's a fumble, isn't it?
[214:22.24]Alright.
[214:32.04]I thought he fumbled it.
[214:32.97]Apparently not.
[214:35.41]This is not good.
[214:36.93]They're going to get it.
[214:37.95]Unless I can get an interception or something, or a good hit.
[214:43.26]That was pretty good.
[214:49.20]Building meter.
[214:50.56]Slowly.
[214:56.14]Please don't hurt them.
[214:57.72]Oh, I'm not hurting them.
[214:58.66]They are.
[215:02.06]Pass.
[215:05.28]How did you... How did you... It was right to you.
[215:09.80]Get some more lotion ordered.
[215:10.76]I'm doing hands no matter how much it is next.
[215:13.35]We're putting him through a vigorous hand training.
[215:18.51]Where's it gone?
[215:26.85]That was just a bunch of salmon jumping out of water.
[215:31.99]They gotta kick a field goal.
[215:40.27]They're going for a field goal right now.
[215:42.20]I'll take it.
[215:42.76]I'm still ahead.
[215:46.18]Oh, shit.
[215:46.60]Did I get it?
[215:47.28]The field goal is good.
[215:48.72]They're chipping away at the lead.
[215:50.44]Can they come all the way back?
[215:54.74]God, fuck.
[216:00.57]Alright.
[216:02.31]Don't burn it.
[216:12.33]Oh, he got completely jigsawed on that one.
[216:14.27]Let's go for a run to the left here.
[216:22.44]Oh, there's a guy who's in pain from a big hit.
[216:24.62]How do you know?
[216:25.58]I don't see him crying.
[216:26.48]But that's probably because he's crying on the inside.
[216:29.02]That's the kind of guy he is.
[216:30.08]And after the game, the trainer's got to open him up, blow dry his spleen or something like that.
[216:33.65]I'm not making most of this stuff up, but I'm just trying to explain to you that it hurts.
[216:40.35]What a catch that was.
[216:41.51]Yeah.
[216:45.25]I'm going for it.
[216:50.79]Knees that bad.
[216:51.63]Good.
[216:51.89]Now the game's out of reach.
[217:12.05]what do I have to win by no I didn't make any bets deep zones the offense looking at first and 30.
[217:39.45]The Super Bowlers, they're about to win the Super Bowl Normal Bowl.
[217:42.52]That was a big hit.
[217:48.70]10% stamina.
[217:50.92]That was a good counter.
[217:58.02]The Normal Bowl.
[218:02.00]Let's do some jamming.
[218:05.28]Watch this right side.
[218:10.84]What?
[218:12.10]Did I just scoop slam somebody and they dropped the ball?
[218:17.02]I need to see that again.
[218:18.14]What happened here?
[218:18.80]So he backs up.
[218:19.30]He... Okay, so he just kind of flicks the ball.
[218:34.04]From his left hand, we're supposed to go to the guy right in the middle, and I'm in the middle of doing, like, a slam to some guy.
[218:39.16]That, what a hero.
[218:41.24]Not only does he belly-to-back suplex somebody, he also recovers the football.
[218:46.57]Nice job.
[218:48.45]QB.
[218:48.51]And he's in the end zone.
[218:49.83]Las Vegas increases their lead.
[219:04.91]That was quick.
[219:06.89]Trick play.
[219:08.89]Look at this one.
[219:09.43]Check this out.
[219:10.59]This is gonna be all over the place.
[219:12.82]That was perfectly executed.
[219:32.67]Even a Crusader guy couldn't stop me.
[219:39.22]Is he alive?
[219:44.48]He actually got up.
[219:45.62]I'm very surprised.
[219:50.43]Uh, safe.
[219:51.01]They are one and four, though.
[219:59.67]Looks like a fumble.
[220:00.81]Las Vegas comes up with the turnover.
[220:03.54]These fellas may have just seen their chances of winning fly out the window.
[220:08.12]And so, with three quarters gone, Las Vegas leads by 20.
[220:11.66]Hey, that is bullshit.
[220:17.43]Yeah, they're a very bad team.
[220:23.11]Back to pass.
[220:25.45]Under pressure.
[220:27.66]And it's intercepted.
[220:28.78]Ezekiel Freeman is hard to stop once the QB's in his sights.
[220:33.05]He does that game in and game out.
[220:34.79]Just consistent great play.
[220:36.33]I mean, we've been playing and watched this game a long time, and he's got to be out.
[220:49.48]Passing on first and goal.
[220:52.34]I was gonna run, but then I got scared because he had an unleash, and I was scared he was gonna hurt my quarterback, which is the main player of the campaign, and I thought I was gonna be out for like five games, and then I panicked.
[221:01.31]I panicked.
[221:09.51]Nice defensive play in complete.
[221:11.72]Third down.
[221:13.52]Oh, it was right.
[221:16.22]Get them.
[221:19.09]What shitty hands.
[221:20.41]They're going to punt.
[221:24.69]The receiver couldn't hang on to him.
[221:26.52]You have to punt.
[221:31.26]Fuck, how do I... I thought I had the guy back there to receive the punt.
[221:35.26]Take another touchdown, thanks a lot.
[221:37.70]Good job, Robbie.
[222:00.78]Robbie.
[222:03.04]Touchdown.
[222:04.40]A really outstanding run.
[222:05.92]He blew past defenders and found some room to run.
[222:09.60]Excellent work.
[222:11.66]Robbie's good.
[222:12.10]Let's take the field goal.
[222:17.22]No, we're so far ahead.
[222:18.10]Who cares?
[222:20.14]No, I wanted to... What are you doing?
[222:23.07]I'm getting booed.
[222:24.41]Whatever.
[222:28.23]And the extra point is good.
[222:30.91]Is Robbie juicing?
[222:32.73]I don't think Robbie's on drugs this game.
[222:35.71]He was on drugs last game.
[222:43.43]Let's go for an injury.
[222:53.19]How's the ribs?
[222:54.25]How do those feel?
[223:03.71]You actually want to buy this I don't blame you it's what it's a very first and 30 it's a very fun game regardless if it's a football game One of those franchises that kind of disappeared I
[223:30.04]Because they did Blitz, Blitz the League, Blitz 2, it was in the arcades too.
[223:34.08]Not this, but... I remember Blitz being in the arcade.
[223:40.69]The defender makes sure he doesn't get that one.
[223:44.41]I would love another Blitz from Midway, which now turned into Netherrealm, right?
[223:51.19]Or are they different companies now?
[223:52.77]What happened there?
[223:55.91]Oh, that could have been a big play if the ball would have gotten to him before the defender.
[224:06.85]owned by... Does he own it?
[224:11.12]Mortal Kombat is great.
[224:14.60]I would love them to take a year off from Mortal Kombat.
[224:17.31]Okay, our new mantra is run the ball.
[224:19.71]and make, well, not a year, I mean, like instead of a good Mortal Kombat cycle, which is about three or four years sometimes, two years, that's wide open.
[224:27.95]Looking for the big play, and it's complete at the 30-yard line.
[224:31.77]The ball comes loose.
[224:32.97]Cincinnati makes the recovery, and that hit drops him like a rock.
[224:39.00]Come on, man.
[224:39.54]We're going to do this all day.
[224:41.78]Let's get up, man.
[224:42.54]So they took a break from Mortal Kombat and made another blitz.
[224:46.02]Good?
[224:46.56]You good to go?
[224:47.56]Go get him.
[224:50.40]There were some great arcade sports games.
[224:53.18]I don't like the simulation games.
[224:57.59]Get up.
[224:59.49]Don't let him have this.
[225:07.92]Never gonna happen.
[225:09.38]Yeah, there was the Bigs.
[225:10.22]There was Blitz.
[225:12.08]NBA Street was another amazing game.
[225:15.30]Why they only make these simulation games now?
[225:18.27]What happened to the fun arcade sports games?
[225:20.67]Has anybody made one?
[225:22.69]Because of the licensing?
[225:23.69]Well, there's no license for this game at all.
[225:37.59]There's no NFL teams.
[225:38.89]There's no license here.
[225:39.61]These are all made-up teams.
[225:40.65]They're not going to do it, are they?
[225:42.01]No, they are going for it.
[225:42.95]Okay.
[225:43.19]NBA Street Vol.
[225:45.17]2 is the best sports game ever made.
[225:47.43]I might agree with you on that.
[226:09.26]That's fairly accurate.
[226:10.04]That's a turnover.
[226:10.52]Blood Bowl.
[226:10.78]Oh no, please don't catch that.
[226:32.65]Oh, I didn't even do any timeouts.
[226:37.29]It doesn't matter.
[226:40.27]I won by a lot.
[226:41.99]Mario Strikers was a great soccer game.
[226:44.93]It was.
[226:47.09]All these games lived in, like, the PlayStation 3 Wii era.
[226:51.34]PS2, PS3.
[226:52.68]Why have there been no... none?
[226:56.56]Next Gen has so much opportunity to make one of those.
[227:00.32]And make them way better.
[227:02.78]A new NBA street?
[227:03.80]I feel like if the technology increases and the amount of things, it'd be so much better.
[227:10.41]Slugfest was awesome.
[227:17.08]There we go, we get a cutscene.
[227:20.70]Nice game you played today, kid.
[227:22.70]Nice?
[227:24.04]It was fucking awesome.
[227:34.04]Sure thing, beautiful.
[227:35.54]Where would you like for me to sign?
[227:37.64]Oh, don't, uh... Don't do it.
[227:40.04]Hey, hold this, partner.
[227:43.47]Hey, I want one, too.
[227:44.69]She a wraith.
[227:47.93]Uh-oh, here comes the jealousy arc.
[227:54.01]Oh, Franchise, you're unstoppable.
[227:57.67]Oh, yeah, you're just unstoppable.
[228:00.31]Got that right.
[228:01.77]Un-fucking-stoppable.
[228:12.28]Is this poisoning?
[228:12.74]What happened?
[228:13.08]Keep... I can do things... Okay.
[228:13.62]Ask around in the locker room, they'll know who I am.
[228:16.94]Keep that.
[228:17.30]Alright, so...
[228:37.49]Don't cheat on Kim.
[228:44.90]I'm not gonna.
[228:47.76]See?
[228:56.40]Kim's the only girlfriend.
[228:58.69]New sponsor stuff.
[229:00.15]Crazy grip.
[229:01.71]Superior ball control.
[229:02.55]I need more hands.
[229:03.37]I told you that's what we're gonna do.
[229:05.33]First things first.
[229:07.57]Take my 276.
[229:08.65]Go to hands.
[229:19.52]Passing.
[229:20.40]I could make my passing.
[229:21.56]Better break tackle.
[229:27.43]Break tackle.
[229:29.79]That means I just have to make more money.
[229:32.17]I'm going to make $250,000, $260,000 right now.
[229:37.40]Is there another image?
[229:38.70]What the hell?
[229:49.19]That's amazing.
[229:50.91]Alright, so we got training.
[229:52.19]Everything's fine.
[229:53.15]Juicing.
[229:57.17]Let's go.
[229:57.63]What do I got?
[229:58.57]20,000?
[230:00.79]Class drain by statement of loss to opponents.
[230:05.74]No, no, no.
[230:06.68]I want to give this to somebody on defense.
[230:09.36]I mean, I am on defense.
[230:15.36]But do I get this on... I get it on defense too, right?
[230:24.25]Because I need to make tackles with myself.
[230:28.73]Let's give Robbie something.
[230:32.63]Reduce the chance of severity of injury sustained or stamina loss from tackles.
[230:37.97]Let's go for it.
[230:38.53]Alright, this is against the Cleveland Steamers.
[230:46.81]Currently 6-0.
[230:49.62]We are.
[230:57.56]We have increased our stats here.
[231:01.70]Pretty even, besides I got a little bit better defense.
[231:04.39]Got a win by more than 23 points.
[231:05.79]I don't have any money, so don't bet at all.
[231:07.47]Why?
[231:07.73]6-0.
[231:09.07]Can we make it 7-0?
[231:12.75]We play the Cleveland Steamers on Sunday.
[231:15.21]The best player they've got is wide receiver extraordinaire, Henry Cho.
[231:19.58]Cho was like the bad guy in a Hong Kong action movie.
[231:25.06]This dude's got Hong Kong action moves off the field, too.
[231:28.50]Cho's got style.
[231:31.65]But he has one problem.
[231:33.25]Half the team is doing his wiring.
[231:35.93]What?
[231:41.39]What?
[231:41.61]That's how you're going to end that?
[231:44.07]Okay.
[231:45.90]So, wide receiver.
[231:46.66]Good thing I'm a safety.
[231:48.48]Because, obviously.
[231:52.58]You know.
[231:57.10]I can cover.
[231:59.95]Big play secondary and this bad pass consistency.
[232:09.23]Good evening and welcome.
[232:10.63]Well, we all know what's at stake here for this team.
[232:13.45]Another win and they're going to the Division III Championship.
[232:16.41]Both teams are ready?
[232:17.23]That's right.
[232:17.95]Championship.
[232:18.81]I got a championship incoming here.
[232:25.12]Got it.
[232:27.92]Step on his head.
[232:29.54]Yeah!
[232:32.96]Right off the bat.
[232:34.17]Two clips.
[232:34.61]Good.
[232:36.11]Alright, so I need to cover.
[232:39.63]Where is that receiver?
[232:42.11]Wide receiver, right?
[232:44.30]I cannot let him catch a pass.
[232:46.30]That's him.
[232:49.94]Pretty worthless in that play.
[232:57.82]Alright, alright.
[232:58.35]There you go.
[232:59.75]I got you, I got you.
[233:00.67]You don't think I'd see you?
[233:01.39]Don't even give him a chance.
[233:04.91]I know, shut up!
[233:05.33]Thunderstorm?
[233:22.09]Nothing.
[233:22.97]Here comes the punt.
[233:24.69]I get the ball.
[233:25.97]Why does your team look like bubblegum?
[233:33.43]Because I tried to make it my stupid colors.
[233:35.84]And it looks awful on the home and the away jersey.
[233:40.34]It looks bad everywhere.
[233:41.44]Did he go through?
[233:47.82]That was weird.
[233:50.19]Alright, so he is not on the field anymore.
[233:58.85]Stop bumping into each other.
[234:01.80]Don't, please!
[234:02.40]Don't catch it!
[234:03.78]No!
[234:03.92]What the fuck did I do?
[234:06.18]How was that such a bad throw?
[234:10.20]Calm down.
[234:14.50]Oh no!
[234:15.14]What the heck did I do?
[234:22.39]Really?
[234:22.81]I didn't buy him?
[234:23.69]Look at that play they just did to me.
[234:45.29]Thank God!
[234:46.53]He just stiff-armed two people.
[234:49.23]That's the guy.
[234:51.67]Thankfully somebody caught him.
[234:54.05]Not this time.
[234:54.49]Stamina has been decreased.
[234:58.59]He's at 80%.
[235:10.96]I had my target.
[235:12.54]I picked the target.
[235:16.26]It's time to put him out for good.
[235:17.66]Put him out!
[235:20.36]Put him... Put him out!
[235:22.78]Third and goal.
[235:44.35]And that's the end of the first quarter as we're scoreless.
[236:11.02]Snap no, no goal line special field goal block.
[236:18.30]I can make it in there Touchdown incoming
[236:45.06]Blocked my enemies.
[236:48.86]Dick.
[236:54.49]Fuck it, I'm going for it.
[236:55.29]See ya.
[237:08.30]I had to go for that.
[237:10.62]And I got a choke slam.
[237:12.08]Nothing fancy.
[237:13.08]And the extra point is good.
[237:37.91]Who gets the ball at the half?
[237:39.03]Remember in the bigs, you could break the scoreboard.
[237:48.41]Yeah.
[237:49.67]You could do a lot of cool shit.
[237:57.76]That's a great game.
[238:01.82]This is making me want to go back and play all those old on my own.
[238:07.06]I mean like 10 years, 12 years, not that old.
[238:09.20]Did he catch that?
[238:11.51]I don't know.
[238:12.19]That was inhuman.
[238:14.19]No game.
[238:36.94]Biggs didn't have a story mode.
[238:38.32]Yeah, this is weird.
[238:39.18]It has... It takes itself... What the fuck?
[238:40.63]I would have had it too if I wasn't trying to get a stack.
[238:45.53]Sorry.
[238:45.81]Thought I could have sacked him.
[238:46.65]It was a risk.
[238:47.31]Stay got it.
[239:07.35]Okay Second and goal Remember to stay hydrated, I agree Drink one glass of water
[239:32.51]for eight ounces of activity.
[239:35.87]Third down.
[239:44.97]Back to pass.
[239:46.10]Got it.
[239:46.76]What?
[239:46.98]Touchdown, Cleveland.
[240:01.96]That was insane.
[240:02.36]I can't fucking believe that.
[240:03.50]He tackled him.
[240:04.74]He fumbled the ball to a teammate that was standing in the end zone.
[240:14.10]It's alright.
[240:14.54]We're still in the game.
[240:16.12]I got timeouts.
[240:31.33]Nobody just decides to go get that.
[240:37.49]That was a waste of an unleash because it didn't do anything.
[240:41.25]Oh, eat shit, video game.
[240:58.93]Big play.
[241:00.17]Field goal.
[241:00.43]Field goal.
[241:00.77]Just stay ahead.
[241:01.45]The Stingers eat shit.
[241:02.25]We'll have one attempt here.
[241:24.76]They don't have an unleash, do they?
[241:26.28]No.
[241:26.38]They have nothing, actually.
[241:28.20]They're not going to get anywhere.
[241:30.55]Might be a good injury opportunity.
[241:35.53]I got like one or two plays.
[241:39.62]Just watch that receiver.
[241:41.38]Double coverage.
[241:42.60]Don't let him get anywhere.
[241:54.13]Robbie is my MVP?
[241:55.41]Yeah.
[241:57.89]I can see that.
[241:58.37]Alright, no.
[242:04.41]I'm staying back.
[242:05.37]You can pass it all you want.
[242:07.53]You got nothing to do.
[242:08.31]Oh!
[242:08.53]Oh!
[242:08.63]Oh!
[242:08.79]Oh!
[242:19.95]I fucking can't believe that shit.
[242:22.35]What the hell happened there?
[242:23.69]You've got to be kidding me.
[242:24.91]I want to see it.
[242:32.38]What happened?
[242:33.48]How did he even get that?
[242:51.83]Alright, we're gonna have to talk about this, guys.
[242:53.29]About this stupid nun.
[242:54.75]Not gonna happen.
[242:55.49]Sorry, I'm not gonna have that happen.
[242:57.21]Let's go with the sizzle.
[242:57.95]Steamers!
[243:15.05]He lets it fly.
[243:16.59]And the ball gets there too late.
[243:18.41]Or should I say the defender got there early.
[243:20.33]Oh, this screamer is steaming mad.
[243:29.48]Intercepted.
[243:34.50]I'm getting really unlucky here.
[243:36.40]Unlucky.
[243:36.62]Unlucky.
[243:36.96]I got a fucking house.
[243:37.70]This is my house.
[243:38.30]This is my house.
[244:05.65]Look, I'm gonna do that shit again.
[244:07.39]Incomplete third down.
[244:10.09]Watch this.
[244:10.51]Watch this shit.
[244:12.99]You're done.
[244:13.83]Touchdown, Cleveland.
[244:37.44]No, I'm 6-0 right now.
[244:39.20]It's a fake.
[244:46.66]That's the best possible thing that could happen.
[245:00.41]Chokeslam.
[245:03.21]No!
[245:03.63]Wrong button!
[245:04.27]Get up!
[245:05.82]Oh, I was trying to circle.
[245:07.98]God damn it.
[245:09.35]I'm so angry about that.
[245:11.49]That was a touchdown right there, and I pressed square.
[245:14.25]I was trying to circle.
[245:15.79]Fuck off.
[245:20.41]I'm not doing that again.
[245:22.75]Get it to Robbie.
[245:26.58]He knows what to do.
[245:39.01]Get it to Robby every time.
[245:48.28]Same thing Robby, you do it.
[245:49.48]Robby, same deal.
[245:50.40]Get it to Robby every time.
[246:07.16]What's with all the fumbles?
[246:24.39]Oh, I so badly need to upgrade those hands.
[246:27.45]I should have just kept the money.
[246:29.99]I should have saved the money.
[246:35.88]That's like the third fumble I've done this game.
[246:44.73]Still plenty of football.
[246:48.39]It's because of the rain?
[246:50.75]Yeah, but where's their fumbles?
[246:57.98]Got it.
[246:58.64]You fucking can't be serious.
[247:00.74]I tried to select him.
[247:02.74]Apparently he wasn't the closest person.
[247:05.44]I would have selected him and pressed triangle.
[247:13.12]I think the defender was more interested in laying the wood than bringing his man down.
[247:16.58]That was a questionable hit.
[247:20.98]If I get a conversion here, then I'm in a good spot.
[247:24.66]I can't get a first down here.
[247:29.89]That's going the other way.
[247:31.29]That turnover could be a momentum shifter.
[247:34.61]alright played smart I was gonna do hail Mary that would not be smart first down and 30.
[247:59.10]Got it.
[247:59.90]Nice.
[248:00.14]Okay.
[248:00.52]I got like four blips for that.
[248:03.12]I really, really needed those.
[248:05.87]Look at that.
[248:08.65]I almost have a full meter again.
[248:12.15]Let's get it out of range of field goal.
[248:14.85]Just get a field goal and then I gotta get the ball back with my meter.
[248:23.84]And the extra point is good.
[248:26.28]I've watched more of this today than the actual Super Bowl.
[248:28.07]As we reach the end of the third quarter, Las Vegas leads by four.
[248:31.55]That's a... I mean, this is a pretty cool game.
[248:39.54]Thank you for joining me.
[248:41.40]Those of you that are in post-Super Bowl mode right now.
[248:44.32]If you've watched.
[248:47.36]Get that bumble!
[248:48.16]Get that bumble!
[248:49.82]Who's got it?
[248:51.33]Retains possession.
[248:54.79]Look at how far back we are though.
[248:59.81]I got a full meter.
[249:00.83]I'm gonna get this ball back and I'm gonna go touchdown right here.
[249:03.55]Look at how far the ball is.
[249:06.67]He has an unleashed as well.
[249:11.81]Alright, this is a good spot to be in.
[249:14.89]Do I let the receiver catch it and try to hurt him?
[249:19.04]He wasted it.
[249:31.65]Unfortunate, but okay.
[249:33.41]Honda!
[249:35.33]Honda!
[249:35.79]Honda!
[249:39.21]It's a big hit.
[249:40.99]Where are my points for this?
[249:43.37]How come I'm not getting any meter?
[249:44.57]Those aren't dirty?
[249:45.17]Apparently they're not dirty enough.
[249:57.31]Fourth down rebound.
[249:58.87]One minute.
[249:59.65]Are they going to punt or are they going to go for it?
[250:05.78]No, they're punting.
[250:09.16]If I get a touchdown here, the game is going to be fairly out of reach.
[250:13.64]And then I'll be 7-0.
[250:14.40]No meter, so I just got to get a solid run here.
[250:20.59]Okay.
[250:29.47]Let's get it to Robin.
[250:32.03]Oh no.
[250:32.35]Okay, it's nothing serious.
[250:34.74]It is though.
[250:50.09]This dude is out every game.
[250:53.49]He gets injured every single game.
[251:15.45]Come on, make it through that.
[251:17.73]Stevers is taking the time out.
[251:20.51]Third and 13?
[251:22.73]Hmm.
[251:27.05]Lightning.
[251:32.16]Bastards.
[251:32.84]Am I in field goal range?
[251:36.06]For three... Field goal?
[251:36.96]How close am I?
[251:46.85]I can get it.
[251:47.25]Got it.
[251:57.22]No good!
[251:59.42]That's no good?
[252:05.02]That was a perfect kick.
[252:06.16]What happened?
[252:15.27]You didn't aim.
[252:16.61]I thought... The game aims for you, doesn't it?
[252:20.22]I don't think you can even aim it, can you?
[252:27.32]Shit.
[252:31.83]He's got an unleash.
[252:32.73]This is not... This is very, very bad.
[252:34.13]Well, there was no kicking tutorial.
[252:42.51]Oh, did you?
[252:44.41]Come on.
[252:44.85]You jumped over the ball.
[252:47.10]You jumped over the ball.
[252:52.92]This is where I put the game away right here.
[252:54.22]I can do nothing.
[252:55.24]Just stay in the zone.
[252:56.17]Outside of the zone.
[252:57.03]In the zone.
[252:57.47]Get in the zone.
[253:00.65]Fuck.
[253:06.51]That was an unleash catch.
[253:10.69]Oh, bad, bad, bad.
[253:12.45]Come on.
[253:13.53]Defense.
[253:18.82]No!
[253:19.30]What?
[253:19.58]How do you catch it?
[253:21.22]How is that possible?
[253:22.06]I was right up your ass.
[253:26.94]I was right up your ass.
[253:28.04]I can't believe it.
[253:31.66]Why did I just do that?
[253:35.99]I just tipped it.
[253:37.73]I just tipped.
[253:38.89]I just timed up.
[253:40.13]That's not what I wanted to do though.
[253:41.63]So.
[253:43.14]Game over.
[253:44.08]Out of bounds.
[253:45.66]Third down and goal to go.
[253:48.42]Un-fucking-believable.
[253:50.64]I gotta make this.
[253:53.52]I gotta have it happen.
[253:56.18]7, 28, 29, 30.
[253:56.56]I just need...
[254:06.63]I gotta run it back for a touchdown.
[254:14.10]No, I, uh, I can't do it.
[254:17.62]I have to run it back.
[254:18.30]I have no meter.
[254:18.88]I have to instantly run out of bounds.
[254:32.55]Okay, okay.
[254:33.77]Alright, let's go.
[254:35.01]Let's go!
[254:42.12]I just hiccuped and almost threw up.
[254:43.64]Okay, here we go.
[254:44.64]Oh, my first loss this season.
[254:52.08]I gave them a timeout.
[255:10.56]Hey, but my character was, like, poisoned, right?
[255:12.88]So that's why he wasn't as good.
[255:15.78]Um, it's scripted.
[255:19.47]I'm supposed to lose that one.
[255:29.08]Uh-oh.
[255:31.96]Do I answer this call?
[255:35.13]I got the championship.
[255:35.63]Okay.
[255:35.77]I got to land a dirty hit on Damon during the Division 3 championship.
[255:37.67]This is the championship game.
[255:38.37]I made it to the championship.
[255:39.11]Where's the hounds?
[255:40.11]Alright.
[255:40.45]Everyone's on drugs this game.
[256:04.65]How are we doing?
[256:06.57]Somebody's got a broken neck.
[256:08.25]Alright, I've got to take a bunch of drugs.
[256:11.70]Regenerate two stamina each play that they're on the field.
[256:14.94]Yep.
[256:17.94]Robbie, resistant to injury.
[256:24.88]And wide receiver, Shepard, is going to take...
[256:34.87]Removes the cooldown effect from Clash.
[256:38.09]No, you're gonna take, uh, the turbo bar drain.
[256:42.63]Good luck, everybody.
[256:47.00]This is the championship game.
[256:53.92]Look at how much better of a team I am.
[256:56.26]Max bet, it's the fucking goddamn Super Bowl.
[256:58.28]Win by 16 points.
[256:59.24]I'm gonna just, I'm gonna crush them.
[257:08.66]Yeah, you can only take three drugs at a time.
[257:13.82]I wasn't poisoned last game.
[257:15.26]I'm ready to go.
[257:15.80]This is it.
[257:20.84]It's the quarterback.
[257:21.50]I gotta land a hit on the quarterback.
[257:29.08]Only three drugs?
[257:30.06]What is this?
[257:30.52]Oblivion?
[257:32.57]Gotta land a hit on Conrad, Danny.
[257:34.30]By the way, this is like the peewee leagues.
[257:36.20]And it's snowing.
[257:36.80]This is the Division 3 peewee Super Bowl.
[257:38.60]Got him.
[257:38.80]Nice start.
[257:39.08]8%.
[257:39.10]Am I dropping frames?
[258:03.72]What the hell?
[258:04.88]Shouldn't be happening.
[258:05.44]Alright, so this is the, it's the quarterback that I need to work on.
[258:08.90]He's a very good quarterback, too hard to do that.
[258:16.48]That was a good fucking pass.
[258:19.84]He just got in my goddamn way.
[258:22.24]Just get him.
[258:23.52]You're not gonna actually...
[258:25.13]Whose... Whose foot is that?
[258:28.31]Is that my foot?
[258:30.31]What?
[258:31.33]What happened to me?
[258:33.26]Why?
[258:45.76]That's un-fucking-believable.
[258:51.36]He'll be back.
[259:03.42]I lost to a poop joke.
[259:04.88]That's so... Oh, what a... What a load of dog shit.
[259:07.91]That's unbelievable.
[259:09.11]How did you do that?
[259:09.87]This person's made out of straw.
[259:11.51]Oh, I know I'm behind already.
[259:12.61]First goddamn exchange.
[259:13.65]I'm gonna lose the championship.
[259:37.60]Oh.
[259:39.30]That was so fucking funny.
[259:43.68]Alright, we're doing it for Chant.
[259:52.75]Break it!
[259:53.53]It's okay.
[259:55.51]That was a beautiful play.
[259:57.35]Red zone.
[259:57.73]We're gonna go for a run.
[259:58.73]Power it in there.
[260:09.95]No, what?
[260:11.91]Didn't I take resistant drugs?
[260:14.47]Why is everybody getting hurt?
[260:16.33]Shattered tibia.
[260:17.71]Everybody took too many drugs last game.
[260:23.42]So now they're all fucked up because they're on drugs.
[260:27.30]They defected.
[260:31.06]It's gonna be a miracle if I win this game.
[260:33.42]I don't even know what to say.
[260:35.82]Speaking of disaster, might as well just do it.
[260:41.53]Bingo.
[260:41.71]Got it.
[260:42.79]I'll take it.
[260:43.41]That's fine.
[260:43.91]What a... Nothing.
[260:44.39]We have.
[260:44.66]We both have unleashed.
[260:45.34]What a fucking... What a joy of a video game.
[260:56.12]What a video game joy.
[261:11.79]Okay.
[261:11.97]Kickoff.
[261:12.71]Tie game.
[261:12.89]It's okay.
[261:13.09]It's fine.
[261:13.31]Not good.
[261:13.51]Not good.
[261:13.77]I still got a guy in the back.
[261:15.63]No!
[261:41.55]Hurt him!
[261:45.34]Why?
[261:45.80]This is so unfair.
[261:50.52]At what point am I going to have not enough people to play the game?
[261:56.60]It really might be that.
[261:59.36]There aren't too many drugs.
[262:13.39]By the way, guy in the back fell down on his own.
[262:17.53]Dude just tripped in the snow.
[262:28.96]This really is the peewee leagues.
[262:33.92]I got all my sponsor gear on too.
[262:35.42]It's like bullshit.
[262:37.53]I'm gonna let you get that one.
[262:42.01]I am closer to a special than he is.
[262:44.33]Alright, come on back in.
[262:49.59]The rollback.
[262:50.49]Whatever that is.
[262:53.21]What is it?
[262:54.37]Third down?
[262:55.09]There's no way to catch that ball.
[263:00.06]I gotta get a dirty hit on him.
[263:01.92]Here it comes.
[263:02.38]Dirty hit.
[263:15.09]Because I just do.
[263:16.55]It fell down in the snow.
[263:18.37]I got a bunch of, like, random dudes from, like, the AA leagues in my lineup right now.
[263:22.47]It's not me.
[263:50.39]Not a bad return.
[264:00.96]Let's do crosses.
[264:04.52]Alright, finally.
[264:05.38]Robbie's back in.
[264:18.66]There it is.
[264:19.78]That's what they call a textbook execution.
[264:33.40]Still haven't seen x-ray ball crush.
[264:36.98]ResidentSleeper.
[264:43.29]Field goal.
[264:44.75]Just tied up.
[264:51.72]And the extra point is good.
[265:03.33]I haven't unleashed.
[265:03.87]Let's see if I can get the ball back.
[265:08.97]Give me that ball back.
[265:10.73]Bump.
[265:13.99]And so at the end of one quarter of play, we're tied.
[265:20.52]You thought I was making the beer-chugging sound effects?
[265:26.94]That'd be pretty cool if I was.
[265:31.14]Where are we going?
[265:32.63]It's that damn quarterback.
[265:34.61]Didn't see them going to shit their pants.
[265:48.94]Yeah, we do.
[265:49.24]We just got a lot of viewers coming.
[265:50.40]Was there a raid?
[265:55.72]Did a raid just come in?
[265:57.74]Or a host or something?
[265:58.94]There's the dirty hit, right?
[266:00.00]Tom Brady raid.
[266:01.26]Whoever is hosting or raiding or whatever, thank you so much.
[266:04.50]I'm not sure who.
[266:05.78]Third down and long.
[266:19.79]That's a shitload of people.
[266:21.37]Ah, this is Blitz the League.
[266:25.75]Nice.
[266:26.33]That's exactly what I needed to have happen.
[266:28.12]They're gonna punt it?
[266:35.76]Oh shit, they're punting it.
[266:42.52]They had a long way to go, that's right.
[267:06.35]We're good.
[267:07.35]Everything's fine.
[267:13.19]First down and 30.
[267:14.15]We need to get a good play here.
[267:21.20]That was a good play.
[267:23.36]Still got plenty of time in the quarter.
[267:28.12]Trick play.
[267:29.00]Razzle dazzle.
[267:30.04]Razzle go.
[267:30.48]We're all tied up.
[267:36.55]Wide open.
[267:37.05]Beautiful.
[267:37.49]Don't even need to use an unleash.
[267:38.45]What do you think?
[267:39.33]No.
[267:39.93]Just go for field goal.
[267:41.11]No reason.
[268:11.06]In a good position.
[268:14.78]Can you do anything else besides the beer chug?
[268:17.06]Uh, yeah, yeah, you can.
[268:18.77]I just don't know the code.
[268:19.71]And the codes, you have, it gives you a blip, so that's why I'm doing it.
[268:26.05]By the way, speaking of blips, injury incoming.
[268:32.67]Yes!
[268:32.81]Perfect.
[268:32.99]Thank God.
[268:33.19]It's going my way.
[268:33.57]Championship game.
[268:33.93]Let's go for a run.
[268:34.61]Not good, but it's okay.
[268:36.27]I've still got plenty of time.
[268:37.57]Run the clock out.
[268:38.07]Oh, no!
[268:38.71]Please tell me that wasn't his knee.
[269:06.13]Looking for the big play.
[269:07.85]And the defender says nothing to it.
[269:10.99]PS4 or is this PS3?
[269:13.42]Why the hell is my daughter on the other team's sideline?
[269:18.42]No, no, don't feel... The offense might want to mix it up here.
[269:24.00]They've been a little predictable the first two downs.
[269:30.72]Fuck.
[269:31.06]Alright, I can get a field goal.
[269:34.22]Just don't screw it up.
[269:35.07]Field goal.
[269:38.00]Field goal.
[269:38.62]Okay, so am I going to aim this in the right place?
[269:40.68]It's good.
[269:48.82]Alright, we're good.
[269:49.74]Nice.
[269:51.12]Triangle, square, X, circle.
[269:53.18]Alright, you got it.
[270:06.91]That was a good late hit.
[270:09.74]Incoming.
[270:10.18]Wrong guy, but it's fine.
[270:11.75]We've been a little frame droppy today.
[270:17.35]I apologize about that.
[270:21.85]First down.
[270:22.81]30 yards to go.
[270:24.69]Don't let them get a touchdown.
[270:26.07]There's 11 seconds left.
[270:32.20]That's some kind of dirty hit.
[270:33.20]Milwaukee really executed on that play and took a big step down the field.
[270:36.82]Nice work.
[270:43.97]That didn't count as a late hit.
[270:54.26]Sorry.
[270:55.82]Just ended.
[271:02.12]I get the ball.
[271:05.42]What the fuck is this clown ship?
[271:07.32]This is Blitz the League.
[271:09.72]I'm running it out of bounds.
[271:10.99]No, I'm not.
[271:11.37]I'm running it into the end zone.
[271:13.81]Oh, come on.
[271:16.53]That would have been perfect.
[271:19.37]Alright, I gotta play the boundaries here.
[271:25.68]Because this is very... We're in snow weather.
[271:30.02]Vulnerable.
[271:33.64]He cannot fumble the ball.
[271:35.74]Just play the outside.
[271:37.60]Second down.
[271:38.26]20 yards to go.
[271:45.39]Fine.
[271:46.03]I'm okay with that.
[271:49.58]Get in there!
[272:03.65]Same guy.
[272:04.97]A second injury.
[272:05.93]Brawby is out again.
[272:07.23]Ugh.
[272:12.37]That was not good, but it's okay.
[272:19.06]This guy is made out of jelly.
[272:21.70]There's no way.
[272:22.32]He's made out of like rubber bands or something.
[272:25.74]Fourth and one.
[272:26.62]I'm not confident.
[272:27.36]Go.
[272:27.50]Just right through the middle.
[272:39.73]Nice.
[272:40.37]Let's go, Lightning.
[272:43.28]Caught it.
[272:43.86]Jelly rubber bands.
[272:44.76]Alright.
[273:11.35]Right side.
[273:14.97]He's too fat to push him over.
[273:16.01]Alright, Robbie's back.
[273:19.02]Circle, circle, circle, square, X triangle.
[273:33.05]Did I actually just do that?
[273:34.19]Fuck.
[273:34.97]Killboard.
[273:35.29]I don't care.
[273:35.69]What the fuck is happening?
[273:36.87]Get up!
[273:37.25]Touchdown.
[273:59.41]It's snow.
[274:00.51]It's stupid snow.
[274:01.67]Slipping snow.
[274:04.39]You can even walk through it.
[274:05.29]Trying to get squished.
[274:06.03]I didn't have an opportunity to do it.
[274:28.66]We're pretty out of reach in the championship game, big guys.
[274:37.91]We might see an entire... That guy wasn't even hard to play.
[274:43.07]It's... I don't know.
[274:43.82]We're gonna have to... I'm not sure you're gonna be able to see the testicles.
[274:49.06]Sorry, guys.
[274:50.70]I'm trying.
[275:05.98]You knocked the quarterback in the next Tuesday?
[275:08.00]That guy just got knocked in in 2009.
[275:11.55]Was that before or after when this game came out?
[275:14.09]I don't know.
[275:16.13]Give me that.
[275:17.37]Goes way downfield.
[275:19.33]And it's complete after 35.
[275:20.73]Touchdown.
[275:24.65]Sorry, we're still waiting.
[275:25.89]Press and run after the catch for the score.
[275:29.11]That's what I was trying to get a hit on the quarterback.
[275:31.71]I would have had that guy.
[275:32.44]I'm the safety.
[275:33.08]I shouldn't be doing that play.
[275:34.96]But I was doing it anyways, I guess.
[275:36.26]Whatever.
[275:37.32]I got it!
[275:38.78]I actually fucking blocked the field goal.
[275:42.26]Yes!
[275:42.92]Oh, I've... Okay, that's a weight off my shoulders.
[275:50.91]By the way, I understand that that reaction was as if somebody was dropping a couch and I was on the other side.
[275:58.85]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[276:02.59]First down, 30 yards to go.
[276:10.24]Bad yardage.
[276:14.02]Onside kick.
[276:16.92]See, now they're just getting desperate.
[276:18.00]Because I got the ball, I got plenty of time.
[276:26.50]Going for the goal.
[276:33.00]What a huge play that would have been for this defense.
[276:36.08]Alright, now I'm just being an asshole.
[276:37.68]Offense with a long way to go here on third down.
[276:41.88]What?
[276:45.62]Robbie, no.
[276:47.18]Oh, man, he got tattooed.
[276:50.55]You got the smelling salts?
[276:51.73]That's it.
[276:52.47]He tried so hard.
[276:54.03]He tried.
[276:54.47]He was such an integral part of the team.
[276:57.83]He's dead.
[277:00.31]We got to win this one.
[277:01.25]Oh, he should be.
[277:04.78]Is this- can I make this field goal?
[277:07.64]Robbie's dead.
[277:09.92]It's alright.
[277:10.94]His memory will live on when we beat- when we win the championship game.
[277:17.26]To get out of peewee leagues.
[277:19.40]And to go into like... Baby division.
[277:27.35]Oops.
[277:38.79]I'm gonna do it for Robby.
[277:40.27]I'm gonna do it for Robby.
[277:45.22]From pee-wee to wee-wee.
[277:48.00]Yep.
[277:50.88]He's a good player, too.
[277:57.95]This is it!
[278:00.01]Oh no!
[278:00.59]That's the quarterback!
[278:07.64]Out for the season.
[278:11.34]Got it.
[278:18.85]Nah, this game is unwinnable for them.
[278:21.13]They have a backup quarterback in right now.
[278:23.19]Why don't we kill him too?
[278:24.17]Oh, I fell down.
[278:31.21]We got to get revenge for Robbie.
[278:33.33]What are you talking about?
[278:34.81]Don't do that?
[278:35.43]You don't want revenge for the broken, shattered neck that they gave to Robbie?
[278:43.60]What the hell was that?
[278:44.38]What the hell was that?
[278:47.92]Milwaukee tears up a good chunk of field there, and you can see him getting revved up.
[278:54.87]First and goal.
[278:55.73]It's gut check time.
[278:56.71]318. 318.
[279:05.46]What the fuck was that?
[279:07.10]What?
[279:07.36]I don't have any... Okay.
[279:09.56]Well, now this just became a game.
[279:11.42]So, I have to run the clock out.
[279:34.42]They need a touchdown and a two-point conversion.
[279:37.23]And as long as I can get a field goal, I can get a goal.
[279:39.75]Uh-oh, Cox.
[279:40.41]I don't have my all-star halfback, though.
[280:01.63]Pick it up.
[280:02.93]Pick it up.
[280:07.13]Game over if I can get an end zone here.
[280:13.00]I should get it because I have the unleash.
[280:15.70]Championship comes to Las Vegas.
[280:17.78]Beer chug again.
[280:33.17]27-40.
[280:33.67]Fourth quarter, game over.
[280:35.41]I win.
[280:37.99]Want to see something funny?
[280:47.89]Oh, this doesn't run the clock out.
[280:50.53]Oh.
[280:52.16]Right, never mind.
[280:55.70]I'm getting booed.
[280:57.60]I'm getting booed.
[281:02.76]Yeah, on their home turf.
[281:08.64]Good job.
[281:09.32]I forgot that.
[281:10.24]I thought the clock was gonna run out.
[281:25.07]That should've been a safety.
[281:28.75]I'm not looking for wagers.
[281:30.57]I'm looking for how many points do I have to win by?
[281:33.13]That was such a bomb pass.
[281:55.06]That's your last play.
[281:55.84]Don't matter.
[281:56.24]I might as well just give you a touchdown.
[282:04.81]And I got one second.
[282:05.63]Quick, quick, quick.
[282:06.03]I wouldn't hurt somebody.
[282:08.29]Championship win.
[282:09.47]That's it.
[282:10.05]I win the game.
[282:11.09]Robbie's dead.
[282:26.25]Out forever.
[282:26.71]I didn't get the $20,000 wager.
[282:29.95]Uh, silver trophy for a rookie.
[282:32.39]Very nice.
[282:34.49]I miss Ravi.
[282:54.76]Both your A and B samples came back positive, son.
[282:57.56]This is bullshit.
[282:58.66]He's never used steroids in his life.
[283:00.80]You're trying to bend him over because he wouldn't play for your precious L.A.
[283:03.66]riot.
[283:05.46]You know, Franchise, I can make this go away.
[283:09.91]Well, if you play for the riot and sign a six-year contract.
[283:14.72]Oh, I got a... I got... Fuck you.
[283:18.02]No deal.
[283:19.12]They're conspiring against me.
[283:20.58]This is what's going on.
[283:21.63]If the sponsors hear you flunked a drug test... Man, I ain't flunked no fucking drug test.
[283:27.84]Except you probably did because we've been taking drugs the whole season.
[283:31.58]Send him in.
[283:33.14]Okay.
[283:34.52]Oh, shit.
[283:35.50]Ultranol is on the FBI's banned substance list.
[283:38.56]In fact, you've probably taken a drug every other game franchise.
[283:42.03]Sir, you're under arrest.
[283:43.47]What the hell?
[283:43.91]No time to explain.
[283:44.99]Got to get you a lawyer.
[283:45.85]If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
[283:49.85]So I'm going.
[283:58.62]Quick, dive out the window.
[284:10.70]Is this the prison arc?
[284:11.64]Welcome to Midtown State Correctional Facility, Mr. Franchise.
[284:18.85]Ordinarily, I don't like having celebrities in my prison.
[284:21.97]However, you're a happy exception.
[284:26.10]Man, what's this?
[284:27.74]Well, it just so happens that next month we're having our annual football game against the Supermax facility down the road.
[284:33.92]And you just became my ringer, son.
[284:37.74]Ain't no movie.
[284:38.94]I ain't playing in some prison game.
[284:41.04]You can play and be out of here in time for training camp, or you can refuse and piss away the next two years making license plates.
[284:47.40]I have to win.
[284:48.66]So what do you say?
[284:50.76]Super Bowl II.
[284:52.33]Get out of jail.
[284:53.37]Sounds good to me.
[284:55.63]What time is practice?
[285:00.03]Milltown Correctional versus the Supermax Prison Team.
[285:07.27]There's a reason we've never beaten the Supermax Prison Team.
[285:11.40]Oh, God.
[285:11.90]And it's guys like Carl Turfence that have made that hellhole their home.
[285:20.42]Tirpitz is serving time for 23 counts of aggravated assault.
[285:24.91]No helmets either.
[285:38.93]Too bad we can't leave Tirpitz shackled.
[285:43.29]This is wild.
[285:45.07]Alright.
[285:46.27]So yeah, I think I know how to play the game.
[285:54.74]Hmm.
[285:56.10]What are the rules?
[285:58.56]Is it just a game?
[286:00.80]Is anybody watching?
[286:09.65]No, this is it.
[286:10.19]We're just out here.
[286:13.23]Who are my teammates?
[286:17.34]Oh, god.
[286:18.00]This is ridiculous.
[286:18.94]Okay, so there's no kickoff.

[286:49.39]Muscle?
[286:50.65]I got a new playbook.
[286:53.66]This is okay.
[286:54.38]Wait a minute.

[286:55.04]There's no I there's no field goal You have to do a two-point conversion And now okay, there's no kickoff there's no special teams this is ridiculous Alright, not bad
[287:23.72]Let's go with... Let's stay with cover.
[287:26.46]That guy's not on the field right now.
[287:33.05]Take the shoulder out.
[287:38.49]That's always the most devastating one.
[287:45.04]Is that guy going to get up?
[287:47.80]Nobody comes and even picks him up.
[287:58.58]Is this it?
[288:14.83]What?
[288:17.38]I forgot how fucking awful that was.

[289:11.79]14-0.
[289:12.71]That's not the same voice actor.
[289:13.57]That's a completely different voice.
[289:17.25]Come on, man.
[289:17.87]We gotta do this all day!
[289:33.19]Is he going with it?

[289:42.62]No helmets.
[290:09.94]Hmm, let's go with Zone Blitz.
[290:13.44]Cox.
[290:13.82]Oh, Cox.
[290:15.32]Cox is being stupid.
[290:16.92]Fuck, I was trying to knock him down.
[290:22.51]I was trying to just jump into him.
[290:26.21]Everybody does, like, the shit emote.
[290:34.29]Fuck.
[290:43.67]Oh.
[290:53.35]Oh shit.
[290:58.63]That's a safety?
[290:59.99]Where are we?
[291:01.75]What the f- Where was that?
[291:03.67]Oh my god, that was bad.
[291:05.78]Oh, this is bad.
[291:24.25]Oh, the game's- the game broke.
[291:26.17]This is- this is all glitched out.
[291:30.75]Did I just intercept the fucking football?
[291:43.78]I can't get out of here.
[291:47.87]Wow.
[291:50.37]Okay, can we, uh, maybe relax here a second and... Something is fucked up with this controller, I think.
[292:03.31]Something's going on.
[292:05.08]Weird.
[292:07.30]I lost, um... I don't see any player icons, shit.
[292:10.24]See what I'm saying?
[292:11.40]What the hell's going on?
[292:13.08]Who's...
[292:18.35]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[292:19.21]Like, this is weird.
[292:20.14]Did I win?
[292:30.36]Yeah, something ain't right.
[292:35.75]Something ain't right.
[292:41.38]I won.
[293:14.55]I won the game too.
[293:15.63]That's unfortunate.
[293:24.31]I'm going to call that a win.
[293:27.23]Did I save the game?
[293:28.67]I'm pretty sure.
[293:30.41]I'm pretty sure save is on by default, isn't it?
[293:34.44]Your current game progress will be lost.
[293:39.20]Yeah, I got soft locked somehow.
[293:51.49]I knew something weird was going on.
[293:52.51]I lost the player icons.
[293:58.40]Yeah, alright, well... That's annoying.
[294:04.48]See if it's still there.
[294:09.80]Everything got really fucky after the ghost interception.
[294:14.44]It softlocked the whole game.
[294:23.44]That was going so well, too.
[294:27.96]Okay, here we go.
[294:29.72]Should be back to normal, right?
[294:31.85]Yes.
[294:32.19]Now I see icons again.
[294:33.05]That was very weird.
[294:34.65]Well, just beat him again.
[294:36.51]Just win.
[294:43.36]Is it snowy outside, or... I don't understand.
[294:46.02]We're gonna... His hand...
[295:02.71]There goes his wrist.
[295:04.77]And his forearm.
[295:06.81]Nope.
[295:06.99]Let's hope he was right-handed.
[295:09.91]Yeah.
[295:10.09]I agree.
[295:10.53]Oh!
[295:10.67]Another exploded...
[295:28.89]collarbone and we're gonna make it even.
[295:44.16]Was that the arm?
[295:45.22]Was that the arm that he did that with?
[295:46.43]That was with the busted shoulder.
[295:47.63]That was with the fucked up shoulder too.
[295:49.51]That's so funny.
[295:50.23]Get the fuck off!
[296:01.07]Alright, let's do some muscle here.
[296:04.53]Belly.
[296:04.95]We got some weird movement there.
[296:06.29]I can go wide open.
[296:11.03]Touchdown.
[296:20.35]I couldn't punch in a code.
[296:24.36]Go right up the middle.
[296:34.52]there are no yeah there's no there's no kicker there's no punts there's no kicking it's just play no field goals that was beautiful
[296:51.73]He anticipated that dove at the exact moment that he needed to.
[296:55.51]And this should get another touchdown right here.
[296:58.77]You know what?
[296:59.10]Fuck it.
[296:59.42]Watch this.
[296:59.82]No!
[297:04.30]That's me!
[297:10.27]What?
[297:28.52]My back hurts after that.
[297:30.14]Oh, come on.
[297:42.84]That was fucking ridiculous.
[297:44.46]I was going to go for a QB sneak and get another free touchdown.
[297:58.40]Up in the old end zone in the sky
[298:28.02]Come on, man.
[298:32.30]This is like doing it for me somehow.
[298:34.11]I'm like, what the hell was that?
[298:35.75]Really?
[298:37.07]A safety?
[298:41.13]No.
[298:50.07]How big is this field?
[298:52.39]This is the second time.
[298:54.71]First time, I had a ghost interception and it fucked up the game and I was up by like 14 points.
[299:00.71]Now, I was up by 14 points again and they broke my neck and ruined my career.
[299:05.79]And then, okay, I need to get these off.
[299:11.57]It's a 50 yard field.
[299:12.87]You only get one possession.
[299:16.32]I can't get over that, stupid.
[299:18.04]How do they have 10?
[299:20.16]15, tango.
[299:48.19]Me.
[299:49.93]Ugh, I love this game.
[299:56.11]Oh, Super Mario!
[299:58.75]You know how to do it!
[300:02.32]Way to go!
[300:18.44]So that's man crush knockout is square, square, triangle, triangle.
[300:37.52]Alright, can somebody explain to me why we just both did the same thing and they have two extra points?
[300:49.93]I don't get it.
[300:50.45]What happened?
[300:55.15]Oh, the safety.
[300:56.54]Right, the safety at the beginning of the game.
[300:58.30]Right, right, right.
[300:59.26]Of course.
[301:01.50]Of course.
[301:02.02]Go for the elbow.
[301:24.64]Gotta watch this.
[301:31.12]Oh, no.
[301:32.19]No.
[301:33.99]There it is.
[301:34.33]Another shoulder.
[301:35.07]Yeah, kick him in the shoulder.
[301:40.15]We see that one all the time.
[301:41.89]The exploded collarbone.
[301:43.47]It's very, very loud.
[301:46.94]Burn left.
[301:48.36]Oh, no.
[301:48.54]They're going up the middle.
[301:49.78]They're going right up the middle.
[302:02.22]Mortal Kombat wishes it was this gross, but this is what I was talking about.
[302:05.26]When I was talking about how the new Mortal Kombat games, after this game came out, they started doing that.
[302:10.59]Like, disgusting stuff.
[302:26.24]Why?
[302:26.54]This dude didn't have to do... He just fell.
[302:30.48]Oh, I fucking don't even know what to say!
[302:32.22]The dude just fucking rolled over and his collarbone exploded.
[302:49.44]What is it?
[302:49.70]What is it?
[302:58.15]Was Ed Boon the dev?
[302:59.37]I actually don't know.
[303:01.25]This is an old Midway game.
[303:03.23]I'm not sure if Ed had anything to do with it, but watch out for the guy on the left.
[303:12.90]Perfect.
[303:14.56]Alright, can I actually win this one?
[303:31.60]No, I don't even know what I did.
[303:32.78]I tried to... No, no.
[303:44.81]The same guy.
[303:46.17]Same guy, same shoulder.
[303:55.99]They got the ball back.
[303:58.12]We're gonna go to overtime.
[304:03.49]Oh, is that just the first quarter?
[304:10.70]Third and 31.
[304:11.18]No, we just keep going.
[304:12.64]Second quarter.
[304:16.28]Nope.
[304:16.74]You think I could see that?
[304:22.50]I could smell you from a mile away.
[304:25.00]Knew exactly what the hell you were doing.
[304:27.32]Say what?
[304:37.44]gonna kick somebody's ass thank you we got a ball spike oh yeah alright
[305:07.17]That's the worst one.
[305:10.35]I'm gonna go muscle.
[305:12.29]I'm gonna go... I have meter.
[305:16.03]Let's go right the middle.
[305:23.55]Can't get him out of nowhere.
[305:31.26]I'm up.
[305:32.72]I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
[305:37.92]No, Jeremy, what the heck are you doing?
[305:40.16]Just try to catch it.
[305:42.74]I'm so hell-bent on... Dah, whatever.
[305:45.76]Fuck.
[305:49.50]I was trying to dive into him and... Didn't get him.
[305:55.13]It's okay.
[305:56.41]Now we are on a completely even playing field.
[305:59.91]Safety in the beginning of the game does not matter now.
[306:08.98]Not good.
[306:09.96]Okay.
[306:11.88]They've got an... He's got a goddamn power here.
[306:19.64]Got it.
[306:21.46]Got it.
[306:34.50]Alright.
[306:35.50]We both have Unleash.
[306:38.56]Red zone.
[306:38.96]We're going to go... I don't want to use my Unleash.
[306:47.24]I want him to.
[306:47.81]Probably use it here.
[306:52.03]Yep.
[306:52.93]Wait, is that me?
[306:56.59]No, thank God it's not me.
[306:59.62]Okay.
[307:01.50]I thought that was the end of the career again.
[307:03.10]Thank God.
[307:04.66]So now I have it.
[307:05.32]Let's see if I can convert this.
[307:08.84]Nice play.
[307:23.09]That's exactly what I wanted.
[307:24.13]No!
[307:30.85]It was for the team.
[307:32.82]You did it for the team.
[307:36.60]That was the guy that did the super tackle.
[307:52.27]Triangle, square, square, triangle.
[307:53.43]I'll try it next time.
[308:05.58]No!
[308:15.57]Can I just play a game of football without having one of my bones explode?
[308:20.78]Can I play...
[308:38.63]Everybody, it's just like a 40% chance that if you get tackled, your collarbone is going to blow up.
[308:47.09]Just, I gotta, and he's the quarterback.
[308:51.36]I'm the quarterback and I'm the safety.
[308:53.46]Can I put him on the bench for the game?
[309:05.34]God damn it.
[309:08.61]I have to keep him completely away from harm's way.
[309:12.85]That means more runs.
[309:32.04]Yeah, that bone heals in like five rounds.
[309:34.11]If you get any injury, it's over.
[309:47.37]Now I'm so terrified to even get involved in a play.
[309:51.13]Because if I roll over out of bed like an old lady, I'm gonna get hurt.
[310:08.34]That was good.
[310:12.66]No, no!
[310:17.94]He's the quarterback!
[310:23.82]Okay, seriously.
[310:26.58]How am I with a quarterback?
[310:30.06]I just had to... Oh, come on.
[310:38.35]He keeps dying.
[310:43.63]Okay, so I'm... I'm gonna run at every play.
[310:55.26]I'm just gonna hand it off to... And they're gonna take the ball from me.
[311:00.40]Don't run it!
[311:01.20]Um, when I pass it, if I get hit, it's over!
[311:04.54]I need to have my, like, halfback run and do, like, quick little slant plays.
[311:18.98]It's these little things right here.
[311:28.35]See?
[311:28.69]Like, it's... Everyone's made out of fucking paper!
[311:32.79]Oh no, it's that mean guy.
[311:35.49]Who cares about this dude?
[311:36.36]Just get the touchdown.
[311:40.58]Was it... Was it square, triangle, square, triangle, triangle, square, triangle, square.
[311:57.86]Alright.
[311:58.94]And the quarters, they're lasting a long time.
[312:10.15]Triangle, square, square, triangle.
[312:11.69]Okay.
[312:13.47]It was triangle, square, triangle.
[312:14.71]It was triangle, square, square, triangle.
[312:16.33]Okay.
[312:17.17]Triangle, square, square, triangle.
[312:22.19]There he is again.
[312:28.66]That guy inmate two seven four five nine four eight six six two five two seven eight four doing a great job Now you're out forever
[312:58.48]I'll use it if I have to.
[312:59.30]Oh!
[312:59.94]Turn over.
[313:01.34]Good.
[313:02.72]Just.
[313:07.95]Don't.
[313:10.67]Do a big pass.
[313:25.65]See, like that.
[313:26.29]That's me.
[313:27.53]That's me right now.
[313:30.01]If I had the ball still.
[313:34.27]Who cares?
[313:34.59]Forget about the jobbers.
[313:37.09]Hulk Hogan used to fight.
[313:39.62]Like a nameless dude.
[313:42.80]Don't catch that.
[313:48.78]Who cares about the warm-up matches?
[313:55.37]Fourth down, shit.
[313:58.43]See?
[313:58.67]Everyone's getting their skull fractured.
[314:01.17]What are they feeding us in here?
[314:05.55]Whatever it is, it's not nutritious at all.
[314:28.64]Nice catch, Tucker!
[314:33.16]My character cannot put his hands on the ball.
[314:38.16]I'm serious at this point.
[314:39.10]I just have to run the clock out and try to play defense.
[314:43.71]Didn't work.
[314:56.34]I think I have to unlock them or something.
[315:04.32]It's alright, I'm up by 12 points.
[315:13.55]And on defense too.
[315:14.59]I can fall the wrong way, I can roll the wrong way.
[315:16.81]There's so many ways this goes wrong.
[315:20.59]Just lean.
[315:21.15]Stay alive.
[315:33.94]I got, uh, Unleash.
[315:37.51]Stay up.
[315:39.37]It's probably only two cabs.
[315:47.90]Fumble.
[315:48.84]Ooh.
[315:50.44]That guy got squished.
[315:52.06]Fumble!
[315:54.88]Yes!
[316:03.93]Okay, don't!
[316:05.63]Just run.
[316:06.81]Just run it.
[316:18.38]I am up by a lot.
[316:20.48]As long... I don't have to play, I just have to survive.
[316:26.78]Quarterback, survive.
[316:35.18]I could potentially turn it over.
[316:36.32]No, I'm not going to do that.
[316:37.62]I think it's like a half, right?
[316:46.76]Okay.
[316:48.17]18 to 0.
[316:48.97]First quarter done.
[316:55.27]All they have to do is kill me.
[316:57.01]But as long as I keep myself out of harm's way, it's not going to happen.
[317:03.61]Let's try to get the ball converted here.
[317:13.35]I'm so concerned.
[317:15.51]I gotta kill that guy.
[317:16.47]I know, I know, I know I gotta kill this guy.
[317:21.42]Alright, doesn't matter.
[317:30.02]Just always stay one step ahead.
[317:37.36]Right?
[317:37.64]Where did my Unleash go?
[317:39.04]Use it?
[317:39.26]I don't remember using my Unleash.
[317:45.37]And Jeremy, why are you passing?
[317:52.05]Thank god it wasn't.
[317:53.33]It was this random asshole.
[317:55.67]Ugh.
[318:15.13]Classic beer chug.
[318:15.94]Let's go.
[318:18.44]I don't care about my team.
[318:19.48]No, I don't.
[318:21.50]Because there's no... Nothing happened.
[318:26.94]This is not my team.
[318:30.65]I need to stay alive.
[318:37.29]Got it.
[318:37.63]Okay.
[318:39.75]Okay.
[318:50.85]I feel like this is probably the one.
[319:00.81]We're not gonna get any phantom players.
[319:02.58]We're not gonna get any broken necks.
[319:10.94]He jumped over me.
[319:13.88]Don't do any unnecessary dives with that character.
[319:21.35]No conversion.
[319:26.65]Good.
[319:26.89]Let's go with the muscle again just to fake around.
[319:33.33]They have an unleash.
[319:34.80]This is a guaranteed injury.
[319:40.88]See?
[319:42.40]Nope.
[319:42.80]They didn't use it.
[319:59.33]Nice.
[320:04.41]Okay.
[320:05.47]Things are looking up.
[320:09.49]Rushing attack.
[320:11.11]Get rid of the ball!
[320:12.97]This don't mean right!
[320:23.40]Oh my god.
[320:26.06]If I had to do this again.
[320:29.60]That was a heart attack.
[320:30.14]I seriously thought I was going to have to do this all over again.
[320:32.34]Look at how far we are in the game.
[320:49.79]Where are my... It's getting weird again.
[320:52.07]I don't have...
[321:05.13]No, it's getting weird.
[321:09.43]People are walking in random directions and shit.
[321:11.33]Okay, I gotta stop him here and that should be game.
[321:19.68]Bingo.
[321:21.72]Just run the ball.
[321:22.70]Just run the clock out.
[321:24.08]Just do it balanced.
[321:25.10]Just... Just run it.
[321:30.82]Who cares?
[321:38.03]Pretty sick.
[321:43.42]No timeouts?
[321:43.92]I don't know.
[321:44.96]What did I just do?
[321:45.42]What play was that?
[321:47.24]What play was that?
[321:55.09]It's actually halftime.
[321:59.95]He just was like, oh shit, I'm not supposed to have this ball.
[322:02.19]You take it.
[322:06.86]You actually have to play through all four corners like this.
[322:09.30]Got it.
[322:10.08]All I need is just to keep... Stay ahead.
[322:20.40]This is why you spec tank.
[322:35.37]Yeah, I did not do that.
[322:36.99]You're right.
[322:40.57]All of my points went into tackling and, what, like strength?
[322:49.16]Alright.
[322:55.66]They don't get a touchdown.
[322:56.32]It's game over.
[322:57.46]No, it's not true.
[322:58.52]It's close.
[323:02.17]Turnover on Dons.
[323:02.93]Perfect.
[323:05.85]Dermot is so stressed he hasn't made a joke in like an hour.
[323:09.84]Yeah, because I want to get out of the prison arc.
[323:17.90]Oh, he broke his spine by punching him in the face.
[323:27.10]How do you- That was some Mortal Kombat uppercut shit there.
[323:36.48]I wish Scorpion does that.
[323:40.56]Isn't that a move that Scorpion does?
[323:44.74]Self is a better player than me.
[323:46.88]Well, I'm playing very timidly because I don't want to die.
[323:48.94]I haven't passed the ball.
[323:53.72]I'm only amongst this game.
[324:06.70]Self doing the work.
[324:07.42]That's great.
[324:14.31]Self, he almost had it.
[324:15.27]No, was that?
[324:15.67]No, that wasn't Self.
[324:22.48]Alright, I was going for a little bit of a play there.
[324:41.70]Turnover They can't get by the defense.
[324:44.38]This is good Same deal
[325:19.30]Hubris.
[325:22.60]I'm up by a lot though.
[325:33.29]Boomer overconfidence.
[325:39.98]Wait, is that?
[325:41.04]No, I don't know.
[325:42.24]It doesn't matter.
[325:42.84]I'm up by so much.
[325:43.76]It doesn't matter.
[325:53.91]I don't want this!
[326:03.98]Right to self.
[326:07.59]Okay, just... Right through the middle.
[326:18.48]Fourth quarter, we're almost done.
[326:21.97]No, no, no.
[326:22.49]Give me something easy.
[326:25.19]Right here.
[326:33.95]Really?
[326:35.63]That was kind of stupid.
[326:43.66]Let's go.
[326:46.56]That guy's dead.
[327:09.76]I was trying to taunt run, and it's the same stick as juke.
[327:17.43]If it doesn't show up on the screen, you juke instead.
[327:41.91]You made that look so good, but holy shit was it bad.
[327:49.58]I got this!
[327:57.22]That looked real cool for how bad it actually was.
[328:08.04]Alright, I need to stop this nonsense and fucking win the goddamn game.
[328:13.63]He did it again.
[328:14.63]He jumped up again and missed it again.
[328:19.39]It's alright.
[328:19.81]He needs like two more touchdowns.
[328:21.83]It's not gonna happen.
[328:27.52]See?
[328:28.00]It's not gonna happen.
[328:28.86]I'm gonna get one right here.
[328:49.52]He ran out of the gas.
[328:50.24]It's okay.
[328:51.32]We're going right up the middle.
[329:03.49]Same thing.
[329:03.77]Do it again.
[329:04.27]Exact same play.
[329:04.93]They're not ready for it.
[329:11.43]I got it.
[329:11.83]Cross the plane.
[329:14.09]Now it's impossible for them to win.
[329:24.96]Can you imagine if I broke my back there?
[329:28.11]I would have shit my pants.
[329:55.13]I gotta kill the quarterback.
[329:55.97]I have to.
[330:05.86]Okay.
[330:07.16]I don't... The play doesn't matter.
[330:08.88]Just get rid of it.
[330:09.44]I win.
[330:27.88]It's over.
[330:34.89]Early release.
[330:35.37]The warden is pleased with your good behavior and has arranged for your sentence to be reduced to have time served to your freedom.
[330:44.81]That was the real Super Bowl.
[330:51.56]What about Self?
[330:52.16]Can Self get out too?
[330:56.52]Trade offer.
[330:59.49]To be traded.
[331:01.15]Hey, Ashwin.
[331:03.49]Oh, what?
[331:04.07]Ooh!
[331:06.11]I can get Cho from... Alright, that's insane.
[331:10.49]Why would you want this?
[331:11.51]Why would you give this to me?
[331:14.46]Oh, I can pick anybody from... I see.
[331:20.98]From the last division.
[331:24.82]Alright, who do I got?
[331:26.09]A B- for wide receiver.
[331:28.03]What do I need improvement here?
[331:31.16]Halfback.
[331:31.78]Robbie died, so... Wide receiver.
[331:37.98]Wallace.
[331:38.66]Look at that.
[331:42.10]That's a huge upgrade.
[331:45.18]We're going to go with Wallace.
[331:49.16]Or Sullivan.
[331:51.27]No, Wallace definitely.
[331:55.63]Wait, hold on.
[331:56.47]This is Cookie.
[331:57.23]Isn't he bad?
[331:59.88]Doesn't Cookie bring, like, the whole team down?
[332:05.45]The only thing, okay, the only thing that'll happen if I bring on Cho is everybody will, like, sleep with his wife, right?
[332:19.14]That's what happened the last time?
[332:21.53]Something like that?
[332:27.92]It's tough to get rid of a B- for an A-.
[332:31.16]I'd rather get rid of, like, a C for an A. What about Sullivan?
[332:34.78]No.
[332:35.18]We gotta keep Robbie back from the dead.
[332:39.70]Defensive.
[332:40.04]What about Latshaw?
[332:41.76]This is a defensive tackle.
[332:43.58]Kind of necessary.
[332:44.86]96 strength.
[332:50.06]82 tackle.
[333:00.35]I'm going to take Cho.
[333:02.61]Or the tackle.
[333:05.20]C plus versus an A minus.
[333:07.92]Way more strength.
[333:10.58]Yeah, we need some more defense.
[333:13.18]I'm going for... I'm going for Latjo.
[333:24.77]Robbie's dead.
[333:25.63]Get rid of him.
[333:26.21]Dump Robbie's corpse.
[333:31.36]Dump Robbie's corpse.
[333:34.66]I mean, this is true.
[333:35.42]He's dead.
[333:40.25]Was Sullivan a team player?
[333:48.29]We have to bury him.
[333:49.49]He died.
[333:53.15]Plus, an A-minus halfback is ridiculous.
[333:57.69]Done.
[334:01.91]I know we're gonna keep him for the meme, but guys, the halfback is one of the most important players in the whole field.
[334:07.58]Robbie's gone.
[334:10.56]An A-minus halfback.
[334:15.67]You saw his neck explode.
[334:20.49]Hi.
[334:21.35]I heard you got out early.
[334:22.63]That's good news.
[334:23.88]Listen.
[334:24.78]You should know.
[334:25.62]It's going to take a while to rebuild relationships, both with sponsors and with me.
[334:30.31]But I'm willing to stick with it if you are.
[334:33.75]And hey, I just want to make sure that everyone's aware of this.
[334:37.29]Robby got injured every five plays.
[334:41.23]So he was actually really on the field maybe like 50 to 60% of the time.
[334:51.32]So did you really like Robby?
[334:54.46]Maybe he did make a few good plays, but I mean, did he though?
[335:00.19]Hey, hey, look who's back.
[335:06.79]Sorry I couldn't pick you up personally from the slam, but I've been busy trying to line you up some new sponsors.
[335:12.77]You do know all the old sponsors bailed when you were convicted, right?
[335:16.17]I got new sponsors.
[335:16.94]But don't worry, because you work your magic on the field, I'll do mine off the field and I will be forgiven.
[335:23.93]Okay, so I got a question for those of you that are in the stream hanging out here still.
[335:32.10]Would anybody be against me beating this campaign?
[335:36.88]Maybe not necessarily tonight, but like next stream.
[335:44.88]Would anybody think that that was a bad idea?
[335:48.18]Because I forgot just how much fun this was.
[335:54.98]Okay.
[335:58.72]So next stream, we're going to continue this.
[336:02.91]I'm not stopping yet, by the way.
[336:06.63]I just know that I'm not going to be able to get it done this stream.
[336:12.35]So... Sorry, I couldn't pick it up from the slam.
[336:15.09]Franchise must perform three different touchdown celebrations next game.
[336:18.99]I've got to do three different celebrations.
[336:20.65]Do I unlock them?
[336:23.09]Okay, hold on a second.
[336:23.65]Let me look at this.
[336:27.84]Ace Attorney next year.
[336:31.30]No, no, no, no.
[336:34.02]So, we got... It was Halfback, right?
[336:40.75]That's me.
[336:41.69]I'm a B right now.
[336:43.31]There's Sullivan.
[336:45.81]The new Halfback.
[336:49.20]Bernie Cox.
[336:52.18]How do I delete this character?
[336:54.30]How do I trade this one?
[336:55.68]Can I just delete him?
[337:00.34]Alright, we got a good halfback.
[337:01.32]The fullback, not so good.
[337:06.32]This guy's terrible.
[337:08.63]We need some better receivers.
[337:09.75]Ashwin's... That's why I didn't want to get rid of Ashwin.
[337:11.89]Because B- is the only... All these other guys suck.
[337:18.73]Tight end.
[337:20.77]Did this back up the B-.
[337:23.48]That's not bad.
[337:27.54]punter.
[337:28.30]My punter's not... The kicker's not bad.
[337:29.52]I have a pretty decent kicker and punter.
[337:38.21]I could have got cookie, but cookie would have brought the whole team down.
[337:44.81]Let's go to the trainer upgrades.
[337:47.67]So I have 400.
[337:48.15]I need hands.
[337:49.40]I told you this is the first thing I was going to do.
[337:51.86]Grip master.
[337:53.38]Do it.
[337:56.70]which leaves me with turbo jets.
[338:02.05]I can't, I can't afford anything else.
[338:03.17]We can take drugs, train automatically.
[338:07.09]What do we got?
[338:09.07]So let me give, um, where is Sullivan?
[338:18.24]There we go.
[338:18.60]Okay.
[338:18.82]Sullivan's going to take decreased clash drain.
[338:22.10]That sounds pretty good for a halfback.
[338:25.36]Turbo bar drains slower.
[338:26.66]That's really good for a halfback.
[338:28.16]Yeah.
[338:29.60]Wait, what's with the team risk?
[338:30.80]Oh, no, I just got in trouble for taking drugs.
[338:35.44]How do I take this off?
[338:38.43]Oh, fuck.
[338:41.93]I just got out of prison.
[338:43.25]I can't remove it.
[338:47.83]I'm going back to jail, I think.
[338:50.75]Los Angeles Riot is the next game.
[338:53.93]Need to win five games to advance.
[338:57.43]Oof.
[339:05.55]They're a much better team.
[339:08.77]Las Vegas must stay within 11 points at the final score.
[339:17.44]Look how much better of a team they are.
[339:19.20]Let's go.
[339:20.50]Finally, we get to play the Los Angeles Riot.
[339:23.81]Our beloved commissioner's dream team.
[339:26.49]The captain of this gang of all-stars is Bruno Battaglia, veteran linebacker and all-around asshole.
[339:32.63]Battaglia has surgically upgraded his elbow with a titanium replacement.
[339:37.55]Not good, considering the man already wrote the book on cheap shots.
[339:41.08]Every Sunday, he writes another chapter.
[339:43.88]Alright, be careful.
[339:47.00]Titanium bionic elbow guy.
[339:56.06]titanium people's elbow helmets become mandatory it's weird because this game actually still holds up pretty well hi and thanks for joining us nearly what 10 15 years later it's a nice field
[340:29.97]Does it?
[340:30.33]Yeah, I think it does.
[340:34.80]Elbow.
[340:36.74]Good luck.
[340:42.40]See you later.
[340:48.03]Fractured wrist.
[340:49.25]Out for eight games.
[340:51.39]Say goodbye to your special teams.
[340:56.39]So, we're going to get a balanced defense here.
[341:01.25]I gotta be careful on offense because that's their captain.
[341:08.21]Blocked it.
[341:11.14]Still got it.
[341:11.58]That was a 10% hit too.
[341:13.10]Is this my new guy?
[341:18.20]I think that... Is that the new guy?
[341:22.79]No, no, no, no.
[341:23.25]He's a halfback.
[341:23.97]Never mind.
[341:32.54]That's how you start.
[341:34.02]This is where I gotta be careful.
[341:35.38]So we have... He's right up the middle.
[341:36.80]Holy shit.
[341:37.04]He still got it.
[341:37.62]Better hands.
[341:37.94]We've seen bounces.
[341:38.54]Yeah.
[341:38.68]Madden's back.
[341:39.28]We'll fake Madden.
[342:06.19]Thank God I got away from him.
[342:09.63]And there he is.
[342:11.45]There's Sullivan.
[342:13.51]Worth the pick up for sure.
[342:14.57]You see how well he dodged there, team captain?
[342:16.81]Nah, he's gonna field goal.
[342:38.55]Thanks, I almost just blew that one Three different celebrations, yep I think I have to unlock them somehow When's the next bathroom break?
[342:56.03]Uh, there probably will not be a bathroom break Oh my goodness There will probably be an end of the stream for the next break, technically
[343:08.82]Bathroom's closed.
[343:10.10]No game.
[343:10.44]Good.
[343:11.10]End of the stream.
[343:12.54]P. Really?
[343:12.90]Get that.
[343:13.26]Still no first down.
[343:15.18]Fuck off, bitch!
[343:39.40]Kill the other team captain.
[343:41.58]Gotta get the ball first.
[343:43.30]He's on defense.
[343:48.55]Where you at?
[343:48.91]Where you at?
[343:51.83]Oops.
[343:52.87]He's got all the time in the world!
[343:55.55]Kill him!
[343:56.33]Kill their quarterback!
[343:58.83]Yes!
[344:08.68]Bruce Kidney, out for the game.
[344:11.71]Out for five plays, that sucks.
[344:16.31]And they're punting.
[344:33.58]Oh, that's pretty good.
[344:35.78]I could have turned that into something crazy.
[344:42.10]That was a pretty decent play.
[344:44.52]I have to get into that end zone.
[344:48.46]First down.
[344:51.65]Are you just pissing a draw?
[344:53.35]Pissing a draw?
[345:11.64]Let's get the ball to Sullivan.
[345:13.22]New halfback.
[345:14.64]What's going on?
[345:20.95]Sullivan with a fucking beautiful catch.
[345:27.17]Holy crap.
[345:28.67]5 and 5 is 10 plus 5 is 15 plus another 5.
[345:31.72]We're pretty close.
[345:33.12]Let's hit the end zone.
[345:37.08]should be able to run it right in alright it's okay is this tongue oh yeah we're tearing up the field here I've seen more gains in my mutual fund not really that's just as pathetic looks like his tongue was like that of his hanging out do you see that back to pass Las Vegas covers it up
[346:07.08]Thank God for that guy.
[346:07.72]I can get there.
[346:08.26]Get in there.
[346:08.58]He's got it!
[346:08.92]Kane!
[346:09.04]He's your brother!
[346:38.39]Different celebrations!
[346:39.51]Oh!
[346:42.39]Dead.
[346:48.72]Sorry, I got too confused there.
[346:58.36]That was awesome.
[347:01.62]L.A.
[347:01.82]Riot.
[347:02.92]Better team.
[347:03.81]You don't get the chemistry that I do.
[347:07.54]You got the stats on paper, but you don't get the heart.
[347:09.94]I do.
[347:10.20]See you in the second half.
[347:17.72]And with the first half in the books, Las Vegas leads by 14.
[347:20.81]Should have made the bet.
[347:25.37]Yeah.
[347:26.07]Look at the stat difference, though.
[347:28.55]I figured it was going to be difficult.
[347:32.48]It was like a 1-14 that I had trouble with.
[347:34.66]Not like the LA Riot.
[347:36.78]Somehow.
[347:41.35]Stay back Bingo Did I just break that tackle?
[347:59.07]Oh no
[348:11.25]It's just a sprained neck.
[348:12.34]It's not a broken neck.
[348:14.52]It's not a broken neck.
[348:16.28]I was about to be very sad.
[348:17.68]83% hit being in two places.
[348:19.82]Oh man, if his neck had shattered that would have been so sad.
[348:23.38]I would have actually been so sad.
[348:35.59]We got a new halfback in.
[348:36.65]First down.
[348:39.50]That's all I care about.
[348:44.68]He almost died.
[348:45.71]No, he didn't.
[348:47.03]Let's do tight stretch.
[348:59.19]Who the hell was that?
[348:59.91]Whoever they are, they're getting a raise.
[349:01.51]Who is it?
[349:01.97]Number 80.
[349:02.35]Let's get a two-point conversion here.
[349:05.25]They can't even score any points.
[349:30.65]I need to celebrate.
[349:31.35]I couldn't.
[349:31.75]I got tackled.
[349:33.19]I got tackled.
[349:33.61]If you get tackled in the end zone, you can't celebrate.
[349:37.81]I might not be able to get it this game.
[349:43.88]Prison arc worked.
[349:47.46]Oh, what's this?
[349:48.56]Las Vegas?
[349:49.36]Better than LA?
[349:52.94]Quarterback is in the game again.
[349:54.40]Oh, that's why.
[349:55.20]That's why.
[349:55.78]I get it.
[349:57.74]They haven't been doing shit since that.
[350:05.36]Envy football, L-U-L.
[350:10.42]It was the pri- the prison was the pit in Dark Knight.
[350:14.56]Nope.
[350:15.82]Can I- could I have gotten up potentially and fought that one?
[350:20.36]Alright, let's do... We're going deep zones.
[350:33.54]That's an interception.
[350:35.38]I tried.
[350:35.60]Tackle again.
[350:36.00]Bring it back.
[350:36.40]Sullivan back in the game.
[350:39.65]Crucial series of downs here.
[350:59.00]He lets it fly.
[351:00.18]Complete.
[351:02.02]Unbelievable.
[351:02.90]I didn't even need to do my meter.
[351:09.48]I wish I bet on this game.
[351:10.40]You ever had that acid reflux, you know, with the heartburn and the rest of it?
[351:15.10]Heartburn.
[351:16.36]That's Ashwin, yeah.
[351:17.48]Glad I didn't get rid of him.
[351:31.81]I'm gonna fail the challenge.
[351:33.85]It's okay.
[351:34.29]Don't worry, you're gonna see an injury.
[351:36.65]That was just me.
[351:40.54]The bet was to win by 11.
[351:41.86]Holy shit.
[351:44.92]10 community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.
[351:49.85]This one's for you.
[351:50.87]Thank you so much for the 10 subs.
[352:00.30]now that that's a that's a PogChamp scenario I think injury dropped it I could have caught it cut quicker next time third down bounce it out little boys and girls
[352:22.27]And the ball gets there too late, or should I say... Another 10 community subs from amscoots.
[352:29.23]10 community subs, back-to-back.
[352:33.11]Thank you to the both of you.
[352:35.63]10 community.
[352:35.99]10 community.
[352:36.75]You guys are fucking amazing.
[352:39.49]Thank you.
[352:43.09]Where are you going?
[352:43.83]Why did he run that way?
[352:50.66]Turns on a dime.
[352:53.33]Alright, I got an Unleashed.
[352:55.83]I got a Sonic Unleashed.
[353:00.29]They do too.
[353:01.79]It comes into the third quarter.
[353:02.97]Last play of the quarter.
[353:05.67]And... I didn't catch that.
[353:06.47]I did not catch that ball.
[353:08.49]And... Yeah, they should be chanting bullshit.
[353:10.54]I would too.
[353:26.75]Let's go for a run, see if I can get it in the end zone.
[353:33.85]No, no, no, no!
[353:34.89]Oh, he's out for four games.
[353:41.17]Come on.
[353:41.55]That's... There are only like five, seven games in a season.
[353:55.96]That's not good.
[353:59.18]Now my 80's gonna have to step up.
[354:00.84]That's Ashwin.
[354:12.76]Ashwin really pulling it up here.
[354:20.34]The halfback Kirk.
[354:23.00]Who's the halfback right now?
[354:24.86]Cox?
[354:25.62]Alright, let's hope he gets his... Let's hope he gets like his... No, don't do an onside kick.
[354:35.63]How do I change that?
[354:47.71]Whoops.
[354:47.95]It's alright.
[354:49.23]I'm going to put 35 to nothing.
[354:50.93]Everything's going to be just fine.
[354:57.50]I'm going to put... I'm going to go in the medical tent or whatever.
[355:00.04]Put him in there.
[355:01.34]Nothing.
[355:02.24]Taking it deep.
[355:04.10]They're getting desperate.
[355:23.48]Is this the last game of the night?
[355:24.48]This is going to be the last game of the night.
[355:26.02]That is what's going to happen.
[355:26.98]Figured it's probably a pretty good stopping place to beat Los Angeles as Los Angeles.
[355:38.25]Oops.
[355:44.52]We will pick back up with this game because I'm having a blast.
[355:47.62]I love it.
[355:48.98]And we're probably about... We'll probably be at the halfway point of the campaign in the next game or two.
[355:57.61]So, might as well just keep it going.
[356:00.61]And... Okay.
[356:08.61]If they hadn't unleashed this whole game... If they hadn't really had possession of the ball for very long...
[356:19.26]No conversion for you.
[356:25.13]Did I get a ball crush yet?
[356:26.29]Yes, I did.
[356:27.33]A few times now.
[356:30.27]That's not good.
[356:34.05]He held onto it, and he's not injured.
[356:36.35]Good.
[356:37.09]Got his revenge.
[356:43.54]Two ball crushes, yeah.
[356:47.99]Looking for, looking for, looking for somebody.
[356:49.81]Looking for somebody.
[356:50.40]Just go!
[356:53.84]What a scamper.
[356:55.02]You know, I had a friend with a dog named Scamper.
[356:58.00]It looks funny because the dog didn't move much.
[357:00.04]I just thought they should have named him Fluffy Lump.
[357:02.56]Or George.
[357:03.70]And it looks like they'll have four more downs to work with.
[357:11.29]Cox getting in there.
[357:13.57]Do it again.
[357:14.41]Wow, that was fucking cool.
[357:15.33]Um, um, hold on.
[357:15.85]What is it?
[357:16.57]I need to do one more, right?
[357:17.97]I haven't done knockouts.
[357:19.63]Square, square, triangle,.
[357:20.35]That should be it.
[357:21.01]Got it, right?
[357:45.22]Yeah, do it again.
[357:48.48]Just beat the fuck out of your own teammate.
[357:53.48]Damn it.
[357:54.73]Thought I could stop it.
[357:56.91]I thought I could stop him, but I couldn't.
[358:00.37]This game's over.
[358:02.53]Start of the season 1-0.
[358:13.33]mmm it was a big hit but not enough to do an injury I think franchise has to do the celebrations oh hmm well that I don't think that's going to happen then first and third don't think so do the philosophy mode
[358:36.36]Here's the injury potential right here Let's just go for a super blitz Just like a blitz everybody all in
[359:04.39]You know what?
[359:05.31]Like... Fucking field goal block.
[359:07.98]He got it again.
[359:08.52]Well...
[359:33.82]I think I can stop it right here.
[359:43.01]What a beautiful turnaround.
[359:44.25]And there goes another broken frog wrist.
[359:51.44]And that's the end of the game.
[359:55.20]See you in hell.
[360:02.31]I get one more play here.
[360:03.63]Hail Mary into the end zone.
[360:06.07]See if I can win by like 50 points.
[360:07.61]Cox!
[360:08.07]Get in there, Cox!
[360:14.84]Too bad.
[360:32.89]That's a lot of yards though.
[360:36.59]That's a lot of achievements.
[360:38.63]Probably a decent amount of money too.
[360:45.80]No wager.
[360:47.06]Oh well.
[360:47.74]$3.92.
[360:47.80]Awesome.
[360:51.96]Magic Hands trophy.
[360:56.54]And that's... I think they like the division leader.
[361:01.14]I'm pretty sure, I think that's like the antagonist in the whole game.
[361:07.07]L.A.
[361:07.35]Riot is in the house!
[361:16.08]Bruno, what's up, motherfucker?
[361:17.90]You just lost.
[361:21.74]You gotta forget about that prison shit, man.
[361:24.04]We've all been there.
[361:25.18]I don't wanna forget.
[361:27.49]The ones that lost.
[361:28.23]Slow down.
[361:28.67]That's two shots in a row.
[361:29.41]Slow down.
[361:29.79]That's four shots of vodka?
[361:31.23]No.
[361:57.05]He doesn't know.
[361:57.75]Punch.
[361:57.99]In the face.
[361:58.71]Three.
[361:59.09]Two.
[361:59.87]I'm gonna find...
[362:34.86]Uh-oh.
[362:36.08]Franchise, I gotta tell you, this is not the way to endear yourself to potential new clients.
[362:40.82]Sponsors are willing to overlook an arrest record, but they still want winners.
[362:45.86]Um... Dude, I'm like fucking eight and one.
[362:49.38]Hey, man.
[362:51.92]I hear you got a call from Tara a while back.
[362:54.20]I know what she sounds like, but trust me, you're gonna wanna meet with this girl.
[362:57.32]Cox?
[362:57.76]She can hook you up with all kinds of shit.
[362:59.94]And if she really likes what she sees, she could be a real freak.
[363:03.10]I think that's Cox.
[363:03.62]You know what I mean.
[363:08.02]Oh, it's Bruno calling me now.
[363:09.98]Hey, punk.
[363:10.76]How's it hanging?
[363:12.77]Sorry I broke up your little love fest with Sans, but you know what they say, the truth hurts.
[363:18.83]When you're ready to leave that piece of shit team of yours and join the riot, give me a call.
[363:23.72]Yeah, I know the right people.
[363:30.77]Ooh, I got some ProCleats.
[363:32.03]Award the ProCleats shoes by Turf Pros.
[363:33.05]Let's take a look.
[363:33.49]Protector, impact, crazy grip.
[363:34.57]ProCleats +2 speed.
[363:35.83]Oh, I need them.
[363:36.55]How much money do I have? $392,000.
[364:00.84]Alright, Injuries.
[364:01.72]I need- this is where we need to- okay.
[364:03.08]I need... Uh, D. Sullivan's got a broken collarbone.
[364:08.24]Two games out, one game out.
[364:10.72]Get as many staff on him as I can.
[364:14.52]Okay, so now he's only gonna be up for one game.
[364:22.46]What we got for Upgrades?
[364:23.30]I think I wanna do Hands again.
[364:27.11]No.
[364:29.29]Probably Speed.
[364:30.27]Yeah.
[364:32.26]Let's get speed to two.
[364:34.67]I have no money now, but it was worth it.
[364:38.79]Girlfriends.
[364:42.13]Kim provides exclusive sponsor equipment.
[364:45.96]I got nobody else here.
[364:51.18]Maybe training?
[364:54.26]Do I have to meet with her or something?
[364:58.83]Huh.
[365:04.54]Is there another place for me to do that?
[365:06.66]Roster?
[365:07.16]No?
[365:10.66]This loser only has one girlfriend.
[365:17.99]Nah, I don't need to do this.
[365:19.95]Alright, I think that's a good stopping point for now.
[365:22.21]She's in the roster!
[365:25.93]You have to equip the sponsored stuff.
[365:31.24]So it's not just on.
[365:32.66]So this has to be equipped.
[365:37.55]You sure?
[365:37.95]I don't think so.
[366:01.74]It's not here.
[366:02.28]I think it's just on.
[366:11.63]Shoes?
[366:20.68]First name, number... Oh, I need number nine.
[366:22.68]Number... Is it double zero?
[366:29.03]Or is 99 as high as you can go?
[366:34.15]Change his colors.
[366:35.23]90 is it.
[366:41.85]85.
[366:42.05]Yeah, alright.
[366:44.47]No, I can't.
[366:44.99]There's somebody on my team that's 85.
[366:46.25]I can't do 69 either, guys.
[366:56.71]How about 50?
[367:00.05]48.
[367:00.07]48.
[367:00.71]Yeah, I think it's just already equipped.
[367:05.95]But that's gonna be it for tonight.
[367:08.31]I am gonna take the next couple days off.
[367:12.27]We went three days in a row here, so I was going to take one or two days off.
[367:16.43]I got some stuff I need to take care of in the house.
[367:22.68]So I will see you guys on Sunday.
[367:27.34]I will probably see you guys on Wednesday.
[367:31.80]And I'm sorry to all the Ace Attorney fans, but I kind of want to beat this.
[367:42.60]It's so fun.
[367:45.84]What a blast this was.
[367:46.88]The last couple of streams, Space Channel... They've been great.
[367:52.02]Not that other streams haven't been, but... Game selection-wise, I think I've been having a lot of fun with the game selection.
[367:58.77]The last, like, four or five straight.
[368:00.49]Resident Evil 2 into, like, Crazy Taxi and Space Channel into this.
[368:06.33]What a great selection of video games in the last two weeks.
[368:12.23]After this Ace Attorney, yes, I will try to get that to work.
[368:15.63]I'll get my audio splitter.
[368:19.84]But that's going to be the end of tonight's stream.
[368:25.02]So thank you all for watching.
[368:32.69]Really appreciate it.
[368:37.05]See you guys on Wednesday.
[368:41.76]For those of you that came in late, yeah, there's a... You probably have no idea what this is.
[368:48.66]But that's alright.
[368:50.98]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[368:52.78]Thanks for joining me.
[368:53.54]And Patriots won the Super Bowl.
[368:56.38]I guess that's... As a Boston, New England guy, Tom Brady now can put a ring in every one of his bedrooms.
[369:10.14]Implying that Tom Brady probably doesn't have, like, a 12-bedroom house, so he has to win at least six more Super Bowls.
[369:16.53]His bathrooms.
[369:18.19]He probably doesn't have more than six bathrooms in his house, right?
[369:20.33]So he can have a ring in each bathroom.
[369:24.23]He can just, like, hang it on the shower or something.
[369:28.70]But, anyways, let's go through the bits.
[369:31.34]See you guys Wednesday.
[369:31.96]Thanks for hanging out.
[369:33.58]That was Blitz the League 2 for PlayStation 3.
[369:37.32]It is a very, very, very fun game.
[369:39.59]Highly recommended.
[369:40.95]And we will complete it.
[369:42.85]Hopefully, on Wednesday.
[369:45.25]And Stadium Seating.
[369:46.27]Thanks for $4, Stadium Seating.
[369:48.85]Hey, Germo, I just want to say you've helped me through so much throughout these past years.
[369:52.24]Whenever I'm feeling down, I've always been able to tune into the streams.
[369:56.02]Or watch your videos on the old channel and laugh.
[369:58.48]And you've helped me through tons.
[370:00.02]Just want to say thank you, bro.
[370:02.77]Thank you, Stadium Seating, for the $4.
[370:06.30]And I'm... I'm fuckin' honored that I'm somebody you can say that about.
[370:11.26]So thank you so much.
[370:14.60]Much love to you.
[370:15.13]Thanks for the $4.
[370:19.13]That was a really good photoshop, yeah.
[370:20.73]A lot of them work.
[370:23.23]Someguy9, thanks for the $5.
[370:24.27]Alright, it's almost 2am here.
[370:26.53]I gotta get up early, so I gotta post this meme video.
[370:29.45]And go the fuck to bed.
[370:31.57]What's with the meme videos lately?
[370:36.32]My audio's in the wrong spot.
[370:38.72]I just scratched my monitor, didn't I?
[370:41.16]God damn it.
[370:43.82]No, I can buff that up.
[370:45.28]Uh, something's... What is it?
[370:49.86]If this is Phantom of the Opera, I'm deleting my YouTube account.
[371:07.69]Oh, it's the- it's the- See you later.
[371:13.79]Youtube.com slash germa95.
[371:14.97]Gone.
[371:15.31]Ah!
[371:23.64]Deleted.
[371:24.18]Just did it.
[371:24.54]I clicked the two buttons.
[371:26.58]Guys, you don't understand.
[371:27.18]There's a red button on every desk I've ever owned.
[371:29.60]That was delete all YouTube videos.
[371:34.92]Every YouTuber has one.
[371:38.50]You know, just in case they come for the files, you know?
[371:43.84]Somebody get, like, where are those videos?
[371:48.08]Like, Mission Impossible.
[371:55.58]The button didn't work.
[371:57.01]Oh, well.
[371:57.73]And I got scammed out of, like, $45,000.
[371:59.71]Like, they're coming for, like, my secret codes.
[372:12.22]You know, what if somebody wants to take control of my channel?
[372:14.46]Nope.
[372:15.60]I haven't got the kill switch in there.
[372:22.46]Thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[372:23.62]Could you give me a new username change?
[372:26.80]I can't think of anything.
[372:27.58]I want to keep the Jess part.
[372:33.87]How about Jess, you got it.
[372:38.33]Jess, you got it.
[372:43.20]That's a real firm handshake of a name, I think.
[372:44.99]Why is Dermot so stinky, laughing my ass off?
[372:53.74]I don't know what I smell like.
[372:55.72]No idea.
[372:57.46]Hopefully you like that new name.
[372:59.57]Thank you, Flugboy, for the $5.
[373:01.25]Super Bowl Sunday.
[373:02.05]Big love to you.
[373:02.69]Jerma, thank you for being so great.
[373:03.87]Also, I'm going to be the Big 20 tomorrow.
[373:07.26]Can't believe I've made it this far.
[373:09.08]Hope you have a great night.
[373:10.02]Happy birthday.
[373:12.02]Probably not sure what time zone you're in, but happy birthday.
[373:17.01]Big 20.
[373:17.65]2-0.
[373:20.95]Thank you so much, Flugboy.
[373:22.39]Hope you have a good one.
[373:24.94]Thank you Creation the Cyborg for the $1.
[373:27.24]Hey Jim, my grandfather died on January 30th.
[373:30.61]Even though I never met him, I was able to see photos.
[373:34.83]Also, the Wii died on the 30th, and I bought my last Wii game.
[373:39.89]Have a great day and let the Super Bowl begin.
[373:41.51]I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[373:51.54]Rest in peace to your grandfather.
[373:54.39]Sorry to hear that.
[373:57.21]But yeah, the Super Bowl began, the Super Bowl ended.
[374:03.79]Patriots won.
[374:16.55]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[374:17.71]Hey, Jerma, how do you like your steak cooked?
[374:22.07]Uh, medium.
[374:25.29]Depending on what kind of cut of meat, I don't really eat a whole lot of red meat.
[374:28.43]I don't really eat a whole lot of steak.
[374:30.83]Because it upsets my stomach sometimes.
[374:33.80]But like a medium to medium well, depending on what the cut of meat it is.
[374:42.60]But it's for hamburgers though, like a cheeseburger.
[374:46.33]I liked my cheeseburgers cooked all the way through.
[374:49.22]So if I get a steak, I'd want it done medium.
[374:51.50]But if I get a McDonald's hamburger, it's not medium rare.
[374:58.02]If I order a burger, I usually just say whatever, like, you know, medium or medium well.
[375:02.00]But I like it usually cooked all the way through for a burger.
[375:07.15]Medium wet.
[375:12.15]So burgers, medium well.
[375:14.51]Steak, medium to chef's choice.
[375:19.40]Hope that answers your question.
[375:21.36]Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[375:22.36]The audio splitter got lost in the mail.
[375:24.12]Probably got lost in the same place as the Pikachu socks.
[375:27.20]Yeah, I don't know something about the mail.
[375:28.20]I don't know what it is.
[375:30.61]Mail.
[375:32.13]Fucking mail.
[375:36.13]You guys are gonna be like... Everyone's gonna laugh.
[375:40.27]When I finally get that mail.
[375:41.41]Thank you, Beck PNG for the $1.
[375:43.73]Hey, Jeremiah.
[375:44.09]I'm here to force you to look at fan art.
[375:46.49]Sorry.
[375:48.08]Sorry, what?
[375:48.88]I wanted to make you something a little more polished in color, so here it is.
[375:53.10]Your stream's the perfect background noise for drawing, though sometimes I end up laughing so hard I can't see the screen.
[375:57.81]Thanks for that.
[375:58.67]Also, you need to know your hair is extremely fun to draw, as is the rest of you.
[376:03.51]Keep up the clownery.
[376:07.53]Look at that!
[376:11.48]Alright, there, like... Here, I'm gonna put this, like,
[376:20.37]Uh, look at this.
[376:21.07]This is just like... There are a lot of talented people that watch these streams.
[376:32.07]Uh, I want to get it on the screen.
[376:45.00]How do I do this?
[376:46.40]Oh, there we go.
[376:51.16]Yeah, there's a lot of- there's a lot of talented- even just like the Photoshop manipulation shit.
[376:57.58]You guys are so quick... with the art- the artwork and the edits and... It's great.
[377:07.56]I need to open it from here.
[377:10.90]I gotta turn this off.
[377:14.14]Hold on.
[377:16.54]Hold on, I gotta put my uh...
[377:18.05]Gotta put my feet in the microwave.
[377:19.23]There we go.
[377:20.97]Okay.
[377:25.61]There it is.
[377:34.18]Why would you do that?
[377:36.82]Take a look at that.
[377:41.54]This is just wonderful.
[377:45.33]You guys are so talented.
[377:48.99]Yeah, make sure we get the Beck PNG right there.
[377:51.68]This is like Jerma is Jerma the Disney character.
[378:00.50]It's got that like old school Disney animated feel.
[378:03.51]I love it.
[378:14.47]Well done.
[378:15.70]Thank you so much, Beck.
[378:22.46]That is absolutely phenomenal.
[378:23.68]Thank you.
[378:28.20]Now you're going to be in Kingdom Hearts.
[378:33.42]Yeah, that's BeckPNG.
[378:35.15]I don't know, Beck, if you have... Because you linked me to a Google Drive.
[378:39.43]I don't know if you have an art page or something, but go ahead.
[378:42.83]If you have it, link it.
[378:47.50]But thank you.
[378:50.02]Fantastic stuff.
[378:54.88]Thank you, Mr. Sneak Man, for the $1.30.
[378:56.16]Hey, Jerem, I've been getting a lot of Dunkin' Donuts iced coffees in the last three years, and I want you to know that the one birthday TF2 video where you drank blueberry iced coffee fueled my iced coffee spendings for three years and counting.
[379:09.96]I especially like the 5% of the time when the coffee actually tastes good.
[379:14.89]Favorite flavor of coffee?
[379:18.37]Well, that's Dunkin' Donuts.
[379:20.85]Dunkin' Donuts is like a doll of 60 for a coffee.
[379:24.88]For like a medium iced coffee, right?
[379:27.74]But it's Dunkin' Donuts.
[379:31.44]My favorite flavor of Dunkin' Donuts is blueberry.
[379:35.12]Just, that's what I used to drink it all the time.
[379:38.06]But now I'm more of a, uh... I think I'm more of a classical English toffee kind of guy now.
[379:52.01]But, there you go.
[379:53.71]Dunkin' Donuts, uh, I do miss Dunkin' Donuts, though.
[379:57.81]It was just so easy to grab, like, a fucking Dunks.
[379:59.97]Because you knew nobody was going to give a shit.
[380:03.65]It's like, oh, you're drinking Dunks.
[380:06.38]It sucks.
[380:07.66]But everybody, it's good, because there's no expectations, and it's just delicious.
[380:14.72]It is, like, such a low expectation, cheap comfort drink, I think.
[380:23.87]I'm not even sure there's a Dunkin Donuts in Las Vegas.
[380:27.54]I don't think I've even looked.
[380:29.50]But I haven't seen them.
[380:36.66]They're not as... ...prelevant as they are in Massachusetts, that's for sure.
[380:45.35]But thank you, Mr. Sneakman.
[380:47.25]Thank you, Divas, for the two bucks.
[380:49.81]Divas always coming in with a few dollars every stream.
[380:52.53]Thank you, Divas.
[380:54.53]Grimoire for the $5.05.
[380:56.31]Thank you, Grimoire.
[380:58.09]Hey, Jerma, I work at a vet in Vegas, and like a year ago when you announced your move, I dreamed that I saw Otto at work and instantly recognized him because I've seen Otto's Big Adventure 1 and 2 dozens of times.
[381:17.55]What?
[381:17.83]Wait, we're spamming a link here?
[381:19.11]What's going on?
[381:19.47]Is this another image?
[381:26.28]I would put this on the stream, but I don't- I want people to be able to go to bed tonight.
[381:33.21]You know?
[381:34.31]I would really love it if people could, like, be able to go to sleep tonight.
[381:41.10]I- I can't even, like, save this link.
[381:43.56]This link is, like, unsavable.
[381:46.96]It's a video.
[381:50.14]This is- oh, this is an MP4!
[381:53.10]How do I pull an MP- what?
[381:57.90]Hold on.
[382:04.34]Let's see if I can get this on the screen.
[382:05.56]I apologize to anybody that wanted to go to sleep.
[382:11.69]Because here it is.
[382:15.61]Here's a strange video.
[382:30.94]It's over on both monitors now, and it's freaking me out.
[382:33.66]I have to take it off.
[382:38.68]That's my transition into the green goblin.
[382:43.67]Holy hell.
[382:46.43]Uh, but thank you, Grimoire.
[382:49.75]Local Las Vegas vet.
[382:55.73]Little Otto.
[382:57.39]Hey, robot mentality, thanks for the five dollars.
[382:59.31]Blood for the blood god.
[383:02.50]Thank you for the $5.
[383:04.69]I'm something of a goblin myself.
[383:06.61]Yeah.
[383:08.01]Hey Scar, thanks for the $1.
[383:09.35]So I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but this man approached me and said he was a top 1000 streamer or something, and he threatened to snap my back in half.
[383:20.08]It's just that fucking image of my face and neck.
[383:23.38]It's like this one.
[383:24.22]No, it's this one.
[383:25.02]It's this one.
[383:25.96]It's this one.
[383:26.96]It's this one.
[383:27.80]It's not that one.
[383:28.43]It's this one.
[383:31.50]but with like the other guy's face, whatever.
[383:34.72]That didn't happen.
[383:38.85]I made the original one and the reverse one.
[383:41.39]This is so fucked up.
[383:51.97]This one doesn't- this looks like a different person.
[383:55.09]All the other ones have looked like me, but it's weird how the bottom of my face doesn't even look like a face.
[384:02.68]This doesn't even look like it could be me.
[384:06.94]This is some weird cousin.
[384:16.45]Thank you, Scar, for your multiple manipulations of photos.
[384:20.35]Thank you.
[384:25.13]We also have Freudian Weapon.
[384:26.21]Five dollars.
[384:28.80]Thank you, Freudian Weapon.
[384:30.34]Appreciate the five dollars.
[384:33.35]uh code man thank you code man for the one dollar Jerma looking like handsome Jack from Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2. thank you smarky thank you smarky for the five dollars Jerma I didn't know you were in a band
[385:03.61]What is this?
[385:04.91]Band?
[385:09.25]What band is this?
[385:13.59]Is that, um... I don't know what band that is.
[385:23.58]Booger Eating Stream.
[385:24.68]Why did I read that?
[385:28.50]They did a song on Tony Hawk 2.
[385:30.00]Oh, okay.
[385:32.68]Uh, lit bulb, thanks for the one dollar.
[385:34.22]Oh, I get it.
[385:35.12]Because today is the Super Bowl.
[385:37.44]Yeah, see?
[385:38.20]There you go.
[385:38.82]You got it.
[385:40.34]You get it, see?
[385:42.84]And a Wednesday is, uh, not the Super Bowl.
[385:46.29]But we're playing it again.
[385:47.17]This is a four day long Super Bowl routine.
[385:54.91]Uh, thank you Creation the Cyborg for the one dollar.
[385:56.84]I promise I will get the internet box.
[386:02.22]Um... I have no idea what you're talking about.
[386:06.90]But thank you for the $1.
[386:07.55]Uh, TimmyTim10, thanks for the $1.
[386:10.13]Video games really do make people violent, Jeremy.
[386:12.07]You're gonna go run down to the Super Bowl and punch... No.
[386:19.47]Thank you, FlankTank, for the $3.
[386:21.41]Now the Dreamcast is over.
[386:24.77]Ever think you would do Nintendo 64 set of streams?
[386:28.56]Some 90s Nintendo nostalgia.
[386:30.98]If you ever do, my vote is for Kirby 64, excluding the obvious Mario, DK, and Goldeneye.
[386:39.71]Yeah, I think all the old consoles should show up eventually.
[386:44.73]But I think we really need to take a break from them once they're done.
[386:47.78]Because there's so many games to play and so many things to see on the old consoles.
[386:56.60]That I don't want to just... Alright, Dreamcast.
[386:58.97]We just played like 15 Dreamcast games.
[387:01.85]Bring on the 64 next week.
[387:04.51]I'd like to do them maybe once every six months to a year.
[387:08.51]So... Because the last time we did the... When we did the big PlayStation 2 and... PlayStation 3.
[387:16.15]I mean, this is a PS3 game, but this is... Obviously, I played this game for six hours today.
[387:22.95]But usually once, like, every 6 to 12 months or so, I like to really... Because then it's expensive, too.
[387:30.59]You know, I think... Just get emulator!
[387:32.33]But I'd really... I'd rather play it the way it's intended to be played.
[387:37.15]So, you know, buying a Dreamcast in 15 games, I mean, that's... It's... I think the total bill for the Dreamcast stuff was at least, like, $700 or $800 for everything.
[387:51.22]I can't really do those, like, once a week.
[387:56.98]GameCube, like, I've spent probably thousands of dollars over the last couple years on just old console stuff.
[388:05.28]SEGA CD, those were very expensive just because they're so old and rare.
[388:09.60]That's a lot of bits.
[388:22.21]Do I still have the SEGA CD?
[388:24.69]I do.
[388:26.05]I do.
[388:26.66]It's in a box somewhere.
[388:28.04]Do I?
[388:31.32]I think it's in like a box somewhere.
[388:32.66]Did I get rid of it?
[388:33.38]Maybe I did.
[388:37.78]Stop flexing.
[388:38.68]No, well, I'm just explaining why.
[388:43.34]On top of, I don't want to just have every... Those streams are really fun to do and they're really fun, but once they're done, they're done.
[388:52.93]You know, if you do like a, let's go back and play a bunch of random 64 games.
[388:56.45]There we go.
[388:56.85]Here it is.
[388:58.37]Alright.
[388:58.65]I can't really do that again.
[389:01.20]You know, it's pretty much a one hand, a poker.
[389:06.98]Now there are some great games that I maybe want to play through, but once you play through them, it's it, they're over.
[389:14.17]Like for instance, Dreamcast.
[389:15.17]I can't like go back and do Space Channel 5 Part 2.
[389:20.22]It's done.
[389:20.92]It was a three or four hour experience and that's it.
[389:23.14]So I want to like save them for times when I know that I want to complete something or when I want to do it.
[389:31.93]A full week dedicated for N64.
[389:34.94]I kind of did that for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2.
[389:36.74]We did Dreamcast games for like three streams in a row.
[389:39.66]Or at least three out of the four.
[389:47.25]And there are some experiences that I didn't get a hand of that I want to do still for some of those old consoles.
[389:53.68]There's still PlayStation 2 games behind me that I never did.
[389:57.72]Just kind of ran out of time slots to put them in.
[390:02.13]But yes, N64, you will definitely see it eventually.
[390:05.79]I just can't really tell you when.
[390:09.11]But thank you, Flank Tank, for the $3 as well.
[390:12.95]Hey, Creation the Cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[390:14.36]It's $9.43.
[390:16.87]Meaning not a lot of time.
[390:22.14]Of time for what?
[390:22.80]Am I missing something here?
[390:29.88]Thank you, Dirty Margaret, for the $1.
[390:31.16]I really thought you were going to lose to Detroit.
[390:34.00]Jax does it again.
[390:39.22]Thank you, Creation the Cyborg, for the $2 here.
[390:42.52]You missed a SEGA Dreamcast exclusive.
[390:45.92]uh Star Wars collection on etsy for 15 do not get halo for the Dreamcast it sucks they did a halo for the Dreamcast they did like a modded halo for Dreamcast
[391:10.52]Well, uh, is it like a black market, Etsy, video game modded community?
[391:19.13]Do people make, like, Dreamcast games still?
[391:21.69]Is this?
[391:29.40]That's pretty interesting.
[391:30.76]I didn't even know that.
[391:32.90]But I think, like, the old console stuff is probably done.
[391:37.58]For Dreamcast, at least, like, for a while.
[391:40.94]Probably revisit, revisited is not the best name.
[391:43.44]Sneep.
[391:43.72]I don't know what the sneep means.
[391:47.22]Um, but the last sentence didn't come out correctly.
[391:51.17]The key was in the lock, but the key wasn't all the way in and I turned it anyways and I couldn't turn the door and open the door.
[391:57.01]So the key went back in all the way and I was able to unlock the door.
[392:02.28]We're fine.
[392:04.45]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[392:05.75]If you're looking for a recent modern Blitz-type game, you should try out the Mutant League Football.
[392:10.51]It's on Steam and Switch.
[392:13.77]Is it like this?
[392:22.72]Because if it's like Blitz, I would definitely give it a try.
[392:25.36]Now, isn't there like a turn-based football game?
[392:27.54]Is that what this is?
[392:30.56]I know there's a turn-based kind of like XCOM football game, isn't there?
[392:39.63]Is that what this is?
[392:43.71]So it's not like kind of Madden style with, you know, passing and running with the analog.
[392:49.56]It's more of like a strategy game, right?
[392:56.14]No, okay, so Mutant League Football is different.
[392:59.16]Okay, so that's Blood Bowl.
[393:01.99]Okay.
[393:03.18]I will definitely check it out because I love Blitz.
[393:07.70]Blood Blow is the Warhammer one.
[393:09.22]Okay.
[393:09.56]Yeah, that makes sense.
[393:14.38]Thank you to...
[393:16.72]kaylor meme me for the one dollar your Jerma started an nhl meme page about three months ago I just wanted you to know that the success I've had couldn't have come without your inspiration and motivation it's already gained nearly 7 000 followers in just a few months and I know it doesn't seem like many followers yes that's a lot but it really feels like once in my life I have a serious influence and voice and things I care about
[393:39.24]Anyways, love you, Jerma.

[393:57.24]They say fuck some... I don't know what that is.
[394:01.16]But 7,000 followers is a lot of people.
[394:09.62]That's 7,000 people.
[394:10.84]Would I ever play the bigs or NHL hits?
[394:22.97]Probably because I remember the bigs being one of my favorite baseball games.
[394:28.50]We'll see.
[394:29.62]One game at a time.
[394:36.00]But thank you.

[394:56.74]Nothing.

[395:16.92]Thank you for the $1.
[395:18.41]Thank you, Dirty Margaret, for the $1.
[395:19.79]The Blitz cutscene is just GTA 4 movie maker.
[395:26.95]I think that for its time, they're pretty good.
[395:31.42]That opening cinematic is very well made.
[395:33.64]I mean, remember, this is the Mortal Kombat guys.
[395:38.06]They know animation.
[395:39.04]They know movement.
[395:40.65]They know exploding testicles.
[395:44.23]Some of the best work they've done.
[395:49.67]Thank you, Sly161, for the $1.
[395:51.40]Thanks to this game, I now know that the human collarbone is a ticking time bomb that can explode at any moment.
[395:56.66]Mm-hmm.
[395:59.71]Thank you, Effectator.
[396:00.97]What's up, Effectator?
[396:03.67]Thanks for the $1.
[396:05.03]I was born with glass bones and paper skin.
[396:07.51]Every morning, I break my collarbone.
[396:09.63]And every afternoon, I break my collarbone.
[396:18.24]Thank you for the $1.
[396:19.58]And sorry to hear that.
[396:23.46]Smashly, thanks for the $5.
[396:25.41]Beer chug is greater than default Fortnite dance.
[396:36.22]Yes, it is.
[396:37.74]It is.
[396:39.78]It is.
[396:40.72]You just made, that was a correct statement you just said.
[396:45.12]Thank you, Windar, for the $1.
[396:47.34]Can't wait for this to be a major motion picture selling millions worldwide and telling us the amazing and very true story of the LA Riot team.
[396:55.49]They even have to bring a tissue for how much I cry.
[397:00.30]Shaded Thoughts, thanks for the dollar.

[397:16.81]Thank you so much, Broluck.

[397:33.50]all around all around the table hey binary man thanks for the one dollar hey Jeremy no stupid video this time I just want to point out that the past few have been audio from left 4 dead 2 and not anything creepy so that last video from the last stream was not me leaning into the microphone being a weirdo that was left 4 dead 2 sound effects
[397:57.08]Well, you fooled me.
[397:59.82]But thank you for the $1.
[398:02.72]Thank you Hans Beetz for the $1.
[398:04.28]They say blip blop, blip blip blip.
[398:07.60]Thank you Hans Beetz.
[398:09.48]Shawnee Noodles, thanks for the $5.
[398:10.98]Ann, Ann who?
[398:12.96]They're probably out drinking right now.
[398:14.57]That's a stellar reference to the Jurassic Park Slippery Arm game.
[398:21.65]Which, I wish I could delete my memory and go back and play that one again.
[398:26.19]That's, like, one of my favorite video games I've ever played on stream.
[398:31.33]Uh, thank you for the five dollars, though, Shawnee.
[398:34.06]Uh, MomoThePeach, thanks for two bucks.
[398:36.42]Couldn't see much of the stream because my D&D session, but want to stop by and say hi.
[398:42.38]Thanks for stopping by.
[398:44.32]Maybe we'll see you next time.
[398:47.62]Thank you so much for the two dollars, and hopefully D&D went well.
[398:51.32]Hopefully you crossed the point of, uh...
[398:56.14]The field of action, whatever it's called.
[398:57.68]I hope you crossed that field of action and you rolled a D plus six.
[399:00.22]I don't know what it's called.
[399:03.00]When you cross over somebody, you're like going next to them and they have to attack them or they have to attack you.
[399:07.90]The field of action.
[399:08.46]What is it called?
[399:10.90]Action of opportunity.
[399:11.78]What's it called?
[399:15.66]Attack of opportunity.
[399:16.59]There you go.
[399:17.97]Hopefully you got the attack of opportunity and you saved the day.
[399:22.81]Thank you so much.
[399:25.12]Bro luck.
[399:25.54]Thanks for the $5.15.
[399:25.94]I can't believe you admitted this on stream.
[399:28.80]I promise it's not a snort.
[399:34.18]I did purchase Seaman and the mic.
[399:39.64]I did.
[399:42.39]I bought Seaman and the mic, and the mic didn't come in the box, so I had to return it.
[399:50.14]And I have to even check to make sure that I got, like, the credit for that, because that was fucking expensive.
[399:54.04]That was almost $100.
[399:56.14]Yes, you heard me right.
[399:58.22]You cannot buy Seaman or the mic.
[400:02.30]The mic for the Dreamcast is, like, $80, and it's the only way you can play these games on Dreamcast.
[400:10.40]That was a hundred fucking dollar purchase.
[400:12.63]It's so rare, apparently.
[400:19.40]Seaman is expensive.
[400:21.50]Incredibly.
[400:22.46]For some reason.
[400:23.04]The disc isn't, but when they bunt, they get you.
[400:27.06]Just buy the disc.
[400:28.08]Why would you sell just the disc?
[400:30.89]Maybe, I guess, maybe if you didn't assume that you just have the microphone?
[400:33.35]Nobody has that.
[400:34.05]How dare they.
[400:40.77]The game requires a lot of time, too.
[400:42.31]I figured maybe we could spend a long time on it.
[400:44.15]At least, like, a few hours on stream.
[400:47.42]Desperately trying to make a fish friend, but we'll have to wait.
[400:52.77]Uh, always make, always check your Amazon orders.
[400:56.47]Because that was two out of, I believe, 14 purchases that weren't correct.
[401:01.19]They either were missing items, yeah, they were just missing, Disc 1 not in Stupid Invaders, and Mike not in Box, clearly explicitly stating, Mike included.
[401:11.67]I wouldn't have paid that much money if it didn't say that.
[401:16.98]Unbelievable.
[401:17.80]But, uh, thank you Brawler for the $5, and only a few more.
[401:21.04]Uh, Jamester, thanks for the $1.
[401:22.63]No message, just $1, thank you.
[401:27.09]Uh, we had CreationCyborg for $1.
[401:30.63]What actually was going on a few hours ago?
[401:33.29]Uh... Your mother was gonna take the internet.
[401:40.47]You gotta listen to your mother.
[401:44.53]Don't disobey your mother.
[401:45.47]You've got to listen to your mother.
[401:46.45]If your mother asks you to do something, you've got to do it.
[401:50.49]It's your mother.
[402:01.10]Sorry, Mom.
[402:01.54]Yeah, you've got to listen to your mother.
[402:06.88]But thank you for the $1, and I hope you're doing well.
[402:11.47]Jess, you got it.
[402:12.73]There it is.
[402:14.33]Jess, you got it.
[402:16.06]One dollar.
[402:16.48]I now realize this could be read as Jess, you go tit.
[402:22.78]But that's fine too.
[402:24.02]No, it's Jess, you got it.
[402:30.11]Name change.
[402:30.63]There it is.
[402:32.57]And that's gonna bring us to the end of the bits.
[402:33.93]Thank you, all of you.
[402:35.99]Credits are gonna roll by.
[402:38.48]Which will lead us to the next few days, like I said.
[402:40.68]No stream over the next couple days.
[402:42.58]Wednesday we're gonna finish... Maybe not, I don't know.
[402:45.40]We'll see.
[402:47.11]We'll see how far we get in Blitz the League.
[402:51.01]But I am immensely enjoying myself.
[402:52.97]Hopefully you are too.
[402:54.95]Take care.
[402:57.05]Much love to you all.
[402:57.91]Let's roll those credits.
[402:59.51]They're not on screen.
[403:00.42]Why is that?
[403:02.16]Oh, it's because... There we go.
[403:04.80]All the resubs, all the new subs, you guys are amazing.
[403:06.34]Thank you so much, all of you.
[403:08.73]Roll them.
[403:14.23]Creation of the Cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[403:15.73]You're right, I'm sorry.
[403:18.53]Uh... You got all Fs.
[403:24.08]And do I have fan mail?
[403:25.16]Uh, I do not have a PO box that does not accept any mail.
[403:30.52]But... Um, take care of your schoolwork.
[403:34.00]You know, you gotta be, you gotta take care of your schoolwork.
[403:35.57]You gotta take, listen to mom.
[403:36.93]Take care of your schoolwork.
[403:42.68]Hopefully that's not true.
[403:43.50]Hopefully that doesn't sound very good.
[403:49.58]Hopefully you can work on that and get some better performance in school.
[403:56.44]Because it is pretty important.
[404:00.78]Did you take care of your schoolwork?
[404:03.26]I took care of enough of my schoolwork.
[404:05.89]Like I said, you don't have to get A+.
[404:09.28]just as long as you show up and do the work and you give a shit enough to take care of it you can you can be a c plus streamer like me that hurt me no don't listen to any of my advice ever unless it's like the five percent of the time when I'm like dead serious mode
[404:38.85]But thank you, Effectator, for the $1 mod, unmod, timeout, then ban Effectator and permanently delete their Twitch account.
[404:48.50]Oh.
[404:49.54]Wait.
[404:54.25]Can we welcome the new moderator of the channel, Effectator?
[404:57.39]If we could.
[404:58.31]That'd be nice.
[405:00.91]I think I was supposed to do that like two months ago.
[405:11.14]Hey, Creation of the Cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[405:13.04]I'll do it, Jeremiah, I promise.
[405:14.22]I'll do it for you and Mom.
[405:16.68]Also, tell SEGA and Cheeto I said bye.
[405:20.76]They say goodbye, and Cheeto especially says, Hope you do well on that schoolwork.
[405:28.64]And listen to your mother.
[405:32.48]Now I gotta unmod you, Effectator.
[405:36.35]And then I gotta ban you.
[405:38.27]So...
[405:42.04]Well, how about this?
[405:43.62]We'll wait a little bit.
[405:44.64]You didn't give me a time frame for this.
[405:47.16]So, I modded you.
[405:48.06]I'm going to unmod you in like eight months.
[405:52.45]And then I'm going to ban you like a year after that.
[405:55.91]And then I'll delete your Twitch account like three years later.
[405:59.57]We don't have a time frame.
[406:04.02]Alright, that's my time.
[406:06.28]See you later.
