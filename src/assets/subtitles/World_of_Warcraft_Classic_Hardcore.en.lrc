[ve:61.1.100]

[01:07.19]It begins.
[01:07.59]It begins today.
[01:11.73]And it probably ends today.
[01:15.05]That's right.
[01:17.25]I might be very late to the party.
[01:20.17]But I brought a bag of fucking cheeseburgers.
[01:24.08]It might be 3am.
[01:27.26]People are kind of done with the party.
[01:29.72]Not me.
[01:31.64]I just showed up.
[01:39.46]Let's get the ads out of the way.
[01:44.84]Give me a few minutes.
[01:46.94]Let's get these ads out of the way so we don't have pre-rolls for the first hour at least.
[01:52.73]I'll be right back.
[01:55.17]Run them.
[03:46.25]uh so for those of you that can hear me I think I may have screwed it up because I think I I have the auto add thing that this set let's hope okay let's hope it doesn't do another one because it might do back I hope it doesn't do back to back we're gonna find out I hope that's not the case uh I was gonna get it out of the way but I think it planned one for like 10 seconds after I just clicked the button I'm still learning how this works okay
[04:18.79]Alright, just everybody hold tight.
[04:21.06]Let's just see what this does.
[04:25.20]I'm ready to fucking grind, by the way.
[04:29.43]I'm just putting on an 80s music playlist.
[04:32.55]And I'm going to go as hard as possible.
[04:34.79]I have my nutrient paste.
[04:36.45]I've got my water bottle right here.
[04:44.57]Yeah, I hope it does not do this.
[04:46.41]I thought that if I did it before the auto thing did... What if I turn the auto thing off right now?
[04:50.29]Like, real quick.
[04:50.75]Just turn it off.
[04:51.13]Let me try that.
[04:52.86]Hold on.
[05:07.82]Okay.
[05:09.02]I think I got it.
[05:10.76]I think I prevented it from happening.
[05:16.53]Let's see if that screwed it up.
[05:18.80]Hold on.
[05:19.38]OK.
[05:22.00]We good?
[05:22.36]I think that did it.
[05:24.26]Let's hope it doesn't do it again.
[05:32.32]You gonna stream tomorrow also?
[05:34.00]I don't know.
[05:39.34]The plan is today and then maybe tomorrow.
[05:41.78]I've got some more time here, so.
[05:44.46]And I'm into it and I'm really into it.
[05:45.60]So, you know, are you ready?
[05:47.58]You guys ready for World of Warcraft?
[05:49.89]We're doing hardcore, which means if you die, your character is gone.
[05:54.27]You cannot come back.
[05:55.01]You can never come back.
[05:57.01]And I'm just going to fucking play and I'm going for it.
[05:59.97]So you want to make the character?
[06:00.96]I don't know.
[06:01.34]OK, I've been playing just to give some total transparency here.
[06:06.89]I have a level 22.
[06:11.30]I also have a level like 30.
[06:15.28]I've been just playing kind of me and Holly have been playing.
[06:18.82]Just kind of on our own time.
[06:21.80]But.
[06:23.90]I still don't know a whole lot.
[06:25.17]It's been a very long time since I've really OK, especially after like level 10.
[06:30.09]Once you pass level 1020.
[06:31.11]I kind of have no idea what the fuck is going on.
[06:34.09]It's been too long.
[06:34.67]It's been like 25 years.
[06:37.83]You're going to have a new character every 20 minutes.
[06:39.61]No, no, I'm going to be just wait.
[06:40.99]You'll see.
[06:42.06]Pretty good milk voice today.
[06:43.20]Yep, that do.
[06:48.06]Alright, here we go.
[06:49.32]You guys ready?
[06:53.48]So here's the question.
[06:59.53]What do I want to make?
[07:01.61]What do you want to see?
[07:02.49]Do you want to see a
[07:08.12]Hunter, Druid, Priest, Warlock, Mage.
[07:14.78]Fucking ads are going to come.
[07:15.84]Okay, this ad thing is fucked up.
[07:17.53]I'm going to have to turn it off right now.
[07:24.83]I'll turn it back on in like an hour when I get up.
[07:26.93]That probably makes more sense.
[07:32.71]Dude, if I run the ad, it shouldn't do... Oh, whatever.
[07:34.99]I could complain about Twitch, but I'm not going to.
[07:39.07]Alright.
[07:39.27]But okay.
[07:39.63]So should we get a poll?
[07:40.53]Alright.
[07:46.19]I definitely don't want to play a warrior.
[07:50.10]That's absolutely not how... Okay.
[07:51.50]I'm going to die at like level six.
[07:52.66]So does this really matter?
[07:53.60]All the classes are identical until level like 20.
[07:57.08]You got like two moves until like level 10 anyways.
[07:59.37]Alright.
[08:02.19]How about... I would play priest.
[08:04.79]I would play...
[08:06.95]Hunter.
[08:08.63]Rogue.
[08:10.93]Warlock.
[08:14.01]I don't know if I, I'm not, I'm not mage material.
[08:17.34]I'm not cut out for mage.
[08:18.30]I'm not mage material.
[08:24.38]A druid.
[08:24.78]Yeah, I would do druid.
[08:25.66]I would do a, I would do a resto druid.
[08:36.02]You know, should we put Mage on there too?
[08:41.75]No, I don't want to play Mage.
[08:45.75]Everyone wants to see Warlock, huh?
[08:55.70]Warlock, Warlock, Warlock.
[09:01.20]Okay.
[09:02.72]Dennis the Warlock.
[09:08.05]I mean, it looks like it's going to be Warlock.
[09:09.96]And I'm not playing anything else but Undead.
[09:13.74]I actually play Alliance anytime I've ever played this game.
[09:16.88]I'm not doing Alliance.
[09:20.44]If I intend on playing with any other people, ever, which, I don't know, maybe, everybody that's playing on this server that I know is Horde.
[09:32.50]So, can't really pick Alliance right now.
[09:42.22]uh so we're doing undead we'll do undead warlock yeah I mean it's warlock just destroy destroy oh wait should we do ranked choice warlock druid priest and then that's it alright now do warlock druid priest and that's it I feel like uh that could go either way do a troll I don't like the troll animations
[10:09.75]and you can't be a warlock if you're a tauren and tauren only taurens can be shamans I wanted to play a paladin but this is classic paladin cannot be on the horde would please have a shaman I'm crying
[10:37.71]We'll do warlock.
[10:38.23]And hey, by the way, I'm doing destruction warlock.
[10:42.35]I'm not doing affliction.
[10:43.55]I'm not doing demonology.
[10:44.91]I want to just do, I want to do like conflagrates.
[10:46.91]I want to just do like the burns.
[10:50.21]I don't know, even if it sucks.
[10:51.15]I don't know.
[10:51.77]Does destruction suck in classic?
[10:53.45]I don't remember.
[11:00.07]I think it does.
[11:00.77]Yes, it does.
[11:01.89]For leveling, yes.
[11:04.20]Oh, whatever.
[11:04.78]It doesn't matter.
[11:05.32]I'm dying in fucking five levels anyways.
[11:11.39]It fucking sucks.
[11:13.39]Alright, we're doing warlock and let's go for it.
[11:15.93]I'm gonna be casting shadow bolts for the rest of my life anyways.
[11:19.19]Okay.
[11:21.43]Important.
[11:22.83]Warlock.
[11:24.67]I already have a warlock too.
[11:25.91]That's the funny thing.
[11:27.05]Hey, so if I die on this warlock, I could just play on my other one.
[11:32.07]That's perfect.
[11:35.27]I have like a level 22 warlock or 23 warlock.
[11:36.91]That's perfect.
[11:45.03]It looks like you.
[11:47.59]Yeah, we all look like this, okay?
[11:50.23]All your skeletons look like this.
[11:55.55]Let's do the... Yeah, this one's good.

[12:03.98]No.
[12:05.10]No.
[12:05.92]No.
[12:11.54]That's good.
[12:14.66]I think that's good.
[12:17.14]I've got a really good warlock name already.
[12:19.46]How about, uh, it has to be something warlocky.
[12:34.89]Alright, this one is... I don't even care.
[12:37.15]This character's dead.
[12:38.45]So, whatever.
[12:39.85]Oh, you know what?
[12:40.27]Actually, I'm not going to... I don't want to tell you their name.
[12:41.99]Because I want to get it in, like, disable a bunch of the social shit.
[12:45.07]So people, you know... And plus, somebody could just steal the name.
[12:48.79]So, I know what name it's going to be.
[12:50.81]It's a terrible name, but I don't care.
[12:52.31]Alright, give me one sec.
[13:02.21]Mm-hmm.
[13:08.52]and it is available of course it is alright you guys I'm I'm ready to put my music on and just start I'm gonna by the way I'm gonna get to level 10 in like 10 minutes I don't have any add-on I got like questy and I've got the damage the details thing but there you can you can hear the audio I want to turn some settings off first
[13:51.01]We're not ready for the playlist yet.
[13:53.22]Wait, you can't hear anything!
[13:55.80]Known by some as the Forsaken, this group fights a constant battle, not only to retain its freedom from the Scourge, but to slaughter those who would hunt them as monsters.
[14:09.54]With Sylvanas as their banshee queen, the Forsaken have built a dark stronghold beneath the ruins of Lordaeron's former capital city.
[14:20.19]We can't see?
[14:20.97]I know, you're not supposed to.
[14:23.07]I have to disable a lot of social shit, otherwise it's gonna be like...
[14:30.49]it's gonna be a slot machine it's gonna sound like a slot machine I don't turn it off and you guys see what my name is immediately obsessed with eradicating the undead and retaking their homeland alright TL;DR don't die you're a warlock be careful victory over their enemies
[14:50.04]How hard is it?
[14:50.84]Okay, I've seen people do this at level one.
[14:53.64]And it doesn't ever... Usually there's a bunch of people.
[14:56.57]But I don't think that's going to happen.
[14:59.67]I think people maybe got that out of their system.
[15:01.63]Like two months ago.
[15:04.27]As one of the Forsaken, you must massacre any who pose a threat to the new order.
[15:10.53]Human, undead...
[15:21.40]Okay, hold on a second.
[15:26.86]Okay, hold on.

[16:02.62]I'm gonna be clicking spells.
[16:04.32]You're gonna be pissed.
[16:05.44]You're gonna hate this.
[16:07.14]But that's fine.
[16:07.72]Alright, here we go.
[16:10.52]Uh, let's do it.

[16:50.69]Fast quest text, right?
[16:52.47]Oh wait, I need my bar.
[16:53.35]I need to do key bindings.
[16:54.49]This is going to be fucking miserable.
[16:57.94]What is it called?
[16:59.64]That's a chaos quest moment?
[17:00.86]Yeah.
[17:01.50]Instant quest text, right?
[17:02.54]But where is it?
[17:03.40]In the interface?
[17:03.98]Yes.
[17:09.16]There it is.
[17:10.82]Show free bag space.
[17:12.98]Consolidate buffs.
[17:14.00]I don't know.
[17:14.38]Who cares?
[17:17.49]Action bars.
[17:17.89]Here we go.
[17:18.21]Yeah.
[17:18.49]One, two, three.
[17:19.53]Put them all up there.
[17:21.91]That's fine.
[17:23.09]Okay.
[17:26.85]Let's get this over here.
[17:27.97]Alright.
[17:29.05]For those of you... Do I have to... Wait.
[17:30.74]Hold on.
[17:31.18]Do I have to explain how World of Warcraft works?
[17:33.16]No.
[17:33.30]You'll be alright.
[17:39.57]Should I play my favorite song ever to get started?
[17:41.87]And I do mean it's my favorite song ever made.
[17:45.89]Yes, please explain it.
[17:46.93]You guys don't know any of this?
[17:51.01]Okay.
[17:51.83]I can't.
[17:52.63]I may as well read you guys the Bible.
[17:55.71]There's a Bible worth of information here.
[17:58.31]Probably like five Bibles worth.
[18:08.67]Alright, hold on.
[18:09.27]I gotta move some bars around.
[18:14.24]Yeah, this is... I don't even know what layer I'm on.
[18:15.96]This is layering now.
[18:17.70]You know, whatever.
[18:18.32]It's fine.
[18:19.90]Okay, I need my actual channel page.
[18:22.91]Hold on a sec.
[18:23.51]Alright, let's turn this... Where are the graphics?
[18:30.15]Render scale, that's fine.
[18:33.59]Controls, there we go.
[18:36.04]That's gotta come way down, like 2.5.
[18:41.01]Oh, hey everybody.
[18:41.67]Alright, here we go.
[18:43.85]Let's do it.
[18:45.41]I'm just going to burn through this.
[18:46.65]I'm going to go real fast.
[18:47.55]I'm going to go very quick.
[18:52.98]If I die, I die.
[18:55.04]Get your snacks ready.
[18:56.24]I got the playlist here.
[18:58.74]Let's fucking go for it.
[19:01.04]I'm going to try to get to 60 in one day.
[19:04.21]By doing quests with no help and like two add-ons.
[19:10.54]You ready?
[19:11.94]Let's go.
[19:18.19]Let's play my favorite song in the world.
[19:19.65]Actually, my favorite song ever.
[19:23.05]If you don't think this is the best song ever made, then you have your own opinion and I disagree with you.
[19:26.33]Let's go for it.
[19:43.82]I sing along if you know the words.
[19:48.11]Sensitivity's still too high.
[19:50.75]You guys gonna sing it in the chat?
[19:52.57]People just, like, follow me.
[19:55.91]Alright, walk in.
[20:10.91]I love how I locked in to go around.
[20:12.37]I just walked around the whole fucking building.
[20:14.87]Sensitivity's too high.
[20:17.85]Who could ever play this game at sensitivity?
[20:20.93]Alright, just listen to this.
[20:24.64]Baby, I can bring you to a kiss from a rose on the grave.
[20:30.02]Ooh, the more I get, I feel stranger, it feels, yeah.
[20:35.62]And now that your rose is in bloom.
[20:41.68]I'm gonna have to do keybindings in a minute.
[20:51.00]Okay, yeah, we'll get a turn on it.
[20:54.21]Yeah, I don't even have plates on.
[20:55.55]There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say.
[21:03.43]You remain my power, my power.
[21:09.00]I already have no- wait, the res- the- the- it's so much regen.
[21:12.94]Hey, let me kill this shit!
[21:15.54]I'm trying to get 60 in one day!
[21:18.23]Did you know that when it snows, my eyes become large and the light that you shine can't be seen?
[21:28.89]Baby, I'd rock and fade to a kiss from a rose on the grave.
[21:37.44]Look it, I'm already almost level two.
[21:41.98]I still gotta get three skulls?
[21:44.54]I don't even have one.
[21:46.72]Okay, there we go, this one.
[22:17.12]I thought you said no add-ons?
[22:23.80]Well, the only thing I have to say to that is... There is so much I can tell you, so much we can say.
[22:36.59]You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain.
[22:44.07]Dude, let's go raid fucking Stormwind with this group.
[22:47.30]It's good to kill these.
[22:49.28]Watch that.
[22:49.70]I already have all these.
[23:14.91]Nothing will happen.
[23:15.95]Oh, level two!
[23:16.97]Oh, no!
[23:17.55]Level two, guys!
[23:21.64]Should we do more pretend pod moments?
[23:25.06]What do you think?
[23:27.12]How many pretend pod moments do you guys want?
[23:40.94]We're going pure destruction.
[23:47.92]There we go.
[23:48.20]Alright, I need to kill a lot of these, actually.
[23:50.68]Yeah, that was Seal, Kiss from a Rose.
[23:59.85]It's the best song ever made.
[24:01.59]Even better than, like, Beethoven and shit.
[24:02.99]It really is.
[24:05.05]Alright, I need, like, a 90s playlist.
[24:07.71]90s rock playlist.
[24:08.93]This whole VOD is just gonna get probably nuked.
[24:11.66]But that's alright.
[24:13.72]This is WoW Classic.
[24:14.52]It's also hardcore.
[24:19.56]Yeah, just make sure I don't die.
[24:21.78]And by the way, I fully expect this group to just be in a circle around me the entire game.
[24:27.73]And if I'm in danger at all, I expect sacrifices.
[24:31.77]I expect sacrifices taunting off of me, even if you're like 10 levels lower than whatever it is.
[24:43.30]It is imperative that I make it to level 10.
[24:50.12]Alright, let's see.
[24:50.60]We got a, uh... What do we got?
[24:56.18]Uh, 90s playlist.
[24:58.58]Classic songs.
[24:59.58]70s, 80s, 90s.
[25:01.20]Guns N' Roses.
[25:02.02]Yeah, that sounds about accurate.
[25:03.16]Let's do this one.
[25:09.69]Let's see what it starts with.
[25:15.47]Okay.
[25:17.95]I need to do keybinds because I... Now that I'm... I got that out of my system a little bit.
[25:23.64]Our action bar.
[25:25.20]I want this to be... First of all, yeah, we're going to go boom, boom, boom.
[25:31.92]And we're going to go boom, boom.
[25:37.39]We're going to go E, R, T. Okay.
[25:40.45]Go like this.
[25:46.63]How do I just delete these?
[25:49.27]I like this guy.
[25:51.39]Yeah, I'm not accepting any requests or anything.
[25:55.15]I hit disable all add-ons.
[25:56.45]Oh, I forgot.
[25:56.87]You can see all this too.
[25:58.15]Whatever.
[25:58.83]That's fine for now.
[25:59.51]Alright, let's move.
[26:08.62]Metallica?
[26:10.54]Oh, alright.
[26:11.48]Oh.
[26:17.69]How many of these do we need?
[26:18.77]Four more of those?
[26:21.09]So World of Warcraft is a game about fighting enemies and by leveling up and by completing quests.
[26:28.31]As you see here, I have a quest here to kill eight mindless zombies.
[26:33.79]And I need to make sure that I do the most damage to it and tag it, because if I don't do the damage to it first, one of these Andes will, like you see, take the credit for it.
[26:42.72]Now, here's the thing.
[26:43.38]All these other people, that guy got level two before I did.
[26:45.88]No, he didn't.
[26:52.01]Uh, everybody here has to do the same quest.
[26:57.11]And you can only do a part- I- I- you can do a raid, but no, I- I ain't raiding.
[27:01.31]I ain't raiding with, uh, with the sacrifice train.
[27:14.00]What are you listening to?
[27:14.82]Uh, and Nothing Else Matters by Metallica.
[27:21.19]I gotta get the damage on this, please.
[27:22.45]Alright, hold on.
[27:27.92]And you get gear and shit?
[27:29.18]Alright, hold on.
[27:30.00]This is gonna be better than everything I have.
[27:34.04]Yeah, okay.
[27:35.58]I can only wear cloth.
[27:36.96]So, if you're wondering.
[27:38.88]Okay, that's fine.
[27:50.53]Can make some money on that.
[27:54.95]Where are these other mindless zombies?
[28:05.18]I haven't played music like this seriously on a stream in probably half a decade.
[28:19.62]Alright, I got how many more?
[28:21.62]Three.
[28:29.65]This is a cover?
[28:30.65]Oh, is it a cover?
[28:38.59]I don't think I've heard this song in a long time.
[28:45.43]You didn't realize?
[28:46.25]I mean, I'm not really listening to it too intently.
[28:54.36]what is this person saying as long as you gotta get the first couple hits on it and now I should attack I gotta attack I do have a dagger but wait you guys gonna start fighting to the death
[29:23.57]Yeah, I want... I want one of you to die.
[29:29.28]I want... The stream demands bloodshed.
[29:31.90]I want to see a Makara.
[29:35.84]Right here in front of me.
[29:45.49]This is level one Makaras.
[29:46.81]You'll be fine.
[29:47.29]You can make another character in ten seconds.
[29:52.14]It is a cover.
[29:53.18]Well, that's alright.
[29:57.18]Two rogues?
[30:14.50]Oh no!
[30:15.16]You killed High Jerva.
[30:18.96]How could you?
[30:27.08]Are they all covers?
[30:28.00]Did I get a cover playlist?
[30:29.74]Maybe I did.
[30:30.22]Oh, it's alright.
[30:33.16]You put music on.
[30:34.06]We'll do the wow music for a while.
[30:37.55]Hey, who brought that over here?
[30:41.75]Are you trying to kill me?
[30:42.39]Okay.
[30:46.97]Let's see.
[30:47.69]I want to do... I can turn this up.
[30:59.49]How come it's starting in the middle of the song?
[31:01.28]Well, I just like skipped forward.
[31:04.02]Thank you for the bloodshed.
[31:04.78]I appreciate it.
[31:09.83]That's a weird... Why am I saying that like I'm thanking a sub?
[31:14.51]That was weird.
[31:24.32]You get to learn new abilities and new ranks of your abilities every two levels.
[31:27.94]So I could get some new stuff and I'm going to, I just want to finish this up though.
[31:40.42]Also up here, this is, I do have the add-on that tells me where things are.
[31:43.94]I don't quite have the arrow, but we'll see how serious I'm actually going to take this.
[31:52.30]Kind of just having fun.
[31:56.73]Anybody see any more mindless ones?
[32:00.64]Mindless zombie.
[32:04.50]No, that's a wretched zombie.
[32:06.40]Wretched zombie.
[32:14.48]Are you doing your tuber voice?
[32:16.30]It's getting there.
[32:17.44]It's getting there.
[32:19.68]There's one.
[32:21.10]Okay, just one more.
[32:28.53]Oh, we got another duel to the death.
[32:31.43]Who's doing it?
[32:33.98]By the way, I expect everybody to do this at the same time right now.
[32:39.68]Pick a buddy, pick a partner, and kill your partner.
[32:43.22]Do it right now.
[32:44.22]Pick somebody.
[32:44.70]Makara, everybody.
[32:47.09]Right now.
[32:52.11]Not me.
[32:53.41]I'm not part of this.
[32:59.17]Dude, you're level one.
[33:02.24]You can just reset.
[33:03.96]You can do it.
[33:13.29]I'm too scared.
[33:14.13]Oh wait, that was just a mindless zombie.
[33:20.82]That wasn't a person.
[33:29.55]Warrior versus what is it, priest?
[33:31.71]Uh-oh.
[33:45.55]Oh shit, there goes another one.
[33:51.69]I don't think this priest is going to make it.
[33:53.01]Hey, to all the real ones, like four of you did that.
[33:58.37]There's probably 20 of you here.
[34:06.36]1v1 me.
[34:07.22]No, I'm not doing PvP.
[34:09.18]When I play PvP, my whole brain locks up.
[34:10.88]Alright, I got all these fucking whispered.
[34:22.85]Alright, thank you.
[34:23.47]I gotta kill one more of these and then I gotta get some new... First time playing WoW?
[34:29.70]No, it is probably my 500th time.
[34:36.17]Classic.
[34:37.79]That's a whole nother story though.
[34:39.47]I played Retail.
[34:42.71]So I did, I played Classic back in 2004.
[34:44.40]And then I did Burning Crusade and Wrath.
[34:48.18]I stopped playing Cataclysm.
[34:50.74]And then, like every addiction, every year or so, the video game addiction just grabs me.
[34:57.97]And every year or two, I just come back and do it again.
[35:01.79]It's been a while, though.
[35:03.35]I came back for Legion.
[35:04.99]I didn't play Warlords.
[35:05.97]I didn't play a whole lot of Mists.
[35:07.41]I did a little bit of Mists, but not really.
[35:09.50]I need one more of these fucking things.
[35:12.70]Some of these chatters weren't even... Yeah, some of these chatters weren't even alive in 2004.
[35:16.52]That's so crazy to think about that.
[35:23.87]I need another one of these things.
[35:26.27]Legion, I think, was the best expansion they ever made besides Wrath.
[35:28.74]Wrath and Legion are the best this game ever was.
[35:32.82]They should just have a Legion classic and just keep it there forever.
[35:38.99]They should have Wrath classic and Legion classic and everything else should just go into the toilet.
[35:45.75]But besides this, obviously, and maybe TBC, yeah.
[35:52.82]I did play a little bit of retail, like the current retail.
[35:55.26]And it was fun.
[35:57.62]I enjoyed it.
[35:58.32]Okay, I got them all.
[36:00.50]I would say the current retail was like a fun experience.
[36:03.50]I didn't... I thought it was kind of fun.
[36:06.70]But yeah, I don't think anything can compare to Legion.
[36:10.24]At least for me and Wrath.
[36:14.39]Original Classic.
[36:16.01]S tier.
[36:16.91]TBC.
[36:18.67]A tier.
[36:19.77]Wrath S tier.
[36:24.00]I think it was, I had it wrong.
[36:25.64]I thought Cataclysm was the worst one, but I think in Mists is when they really kind of screwed everything up.
[36:32.89]Okay, what do I got?
[36:34.61]Give me that back.
[36:37.13]Some more shit.
[36:38.23]Tainted Scroll.
[36:40.86]Kill 12 Rattlecage Skeletons and return.
[36:43.34]Okay.
[36:46.66]That's a -2 expansion opinion.
[36:51.05]I feel like that is the safest.
[36:53.59]Completely safe opinion of this game.
[36:59.12]I can't think of a safer opinion than what I just said.
[37:04.40]I got my imp very go.
[37:07.52]I said warlocks get pets.
[37:10.57]And.
[37:10.81]This one is an imp.
[37:16.83]Streets fireballs gives you stamina.
[37:21.53]Are you in Only Fangs?
[37:22.73]I'm not in Only Fangs.
[37:36.36]Are you a clicker?
[37:37.90]Um, I am a top row clicker.
[37:47.08]And what I mean by that is all these are keybinds.
[37:50.92]I'm a top row clicker.
[37:55.09]So that's just the way it is.
[37:56.85]Alright.
[37:57.11]Did I get everything?
[37:57.71]I think I got everything right.
[37:58.87]Yeah.
[37:59.67]So now we're going to kill all this shit out here.
[38:04.35]If I use mouse to turn, how do I click rend?
[38:08.33]That's your top row clicker.
[38:09.45]That's not a good look.
[38:11.44]That's okay.
[38:22.61]I forgot you could like fart on people I'd play this if it was a single you can play this as a single player game if you really want to I mean I would say why are you playing a game where you can be social where you just be want to do it alone but it's definitely possible
[38:46.77]Oh, I need to get my... Wait, wait, wait.
[38:48.39]Kill this thing.
[38:49.29]Everybody... I command it.
[38:52.33]I need to get my new abilities.
[38:55.01]Who's this?
[38:56.69]Who's fucking... Who's that?
[39:05.07]Where is the... Where... Where's my... Oh, there it is.
[39:11.65]Because I want to see... Isn't there a...
[39:17.53]Where's my class trainer?
[39:18.69]There we go.
[39:19.13]Okay.
[39:19.73]Where is he?
[39:21.07]Over there.
[39:24.05]Are you going to be the Lich King?
[39:26.73]Um, does the Lich King make it to level 11 and fall off of Thunder Bluff and scream, no, what the, no.
[39:38.47]Oh my God.
[39:39.69]Uh, cause then yes.
[39:47.85]there we go alright so every two levels you get to learn new abilities and new ranks of your abilities right now I can only learn immolate which this is what I want remember I'm going to be destruction so we're all I care about and I'm getting plus fire damage I don't care if I'm at the bottom of the dps charts everybody I don't care we're going burn we're going burn burn burn
[40:16.95]So immolate is a fire ability, burns the enemy for nine damage initially, and then it's a 20 damage dot over 15 seconds.
[40:31.94]How is JermaCraft not taken?
[40:33.52]I don't know.
[40:39.78]I don't know.
[40:40.95]I don't think anybody's really...
[40:43.26]that's not like really in right now that's not like who's oh yeah dude JermaCraft that I mean maybe like 10 years ago so you wait you want to start with the immolate get the tick on there and then shadow bolts
[41:02.54]Now, I think a lot of the people that play this game very well would probably say, Jerma, don't even cast that move.
[41:08.57]Just do Shadow Bolts.
[41:09.33]There's no reason to do anything else.
[41:10.35]The damage, it's just so much better.
[41:12.39]Your actual DPS falls off if you do the other move.
[41:15.69]That's alright.
[41:16.13]Alright, I need six Duskbat Wings.
[41:20.15]Let's go ahead and do that.
[41:25.89]Already dead.
[41:26.35]You know, I may as well just tag things, I guess.
[41:40.26]Alright, I need pause.
[41:47.12]They are, they're gimping your XP.
[41:50.43]Yeah, but I mean, what am I going to do?
[41:52.01]Alright, what would you like me to do?
[41:54.87]Would you like me to ask everybody nicely to leave?
[41:56.71]Okay, everybody, please leave.
[42:00.51]I need to get my total experience points.
[42:02.63]I hope you all understand.
[42:13.50]Oh, I can get layered too.
[42:16.76]But hey, layer me, layer me, man.
[42:18.26]I got to get out of here.
[42:22.24]Wait, did somebody say the JermaCraft guy died?
[42:24.62]I don't even think it's possible to die out here.
[42:34.46]Oh shit, these people are layering me.
[42:40.17]Oh, alright.
[42:41.17]Fine, fine.
[42:41.67]Alright.
[42:41.91]Yeah.
[42:42.11]Yeah.
[42:42.53]Let's see.
[42:43.21]I'll see you.
[42:43.59]Let me see what happens when I do this.
[42:52.34]Hey, all your original.
[42:53.56]Oh, there they all go.
[42:54.24]Holy shit.
[42:55.42]It worked.
[42:56.14]What?
[43:00.82]Oh, my God.
[43:01.44]It actually worked.
[43:13.16]no int oh I see got it I'm good okay let's get out of here so now I'll get full experience I gotta set up a macro so this thing attacks when I attack because otherwise it will not unless I take damage
[43:50.36]yeah that's much better just set it to attack on will oh that's a horrible idea you start setting that up uh you'll pull a whole group and then everyone will hate you hey Chris chaos Chris
[44:28.65]I love how you say that and then you and you just like leave.
[44:30.89]You just that's so funny.
[44:35.21]I need two more of these.
[44:36.01]OK.
[44:48.08]I don't know.
[44:50.34]I only have one of these.
[44:51.14]I need more water too.
[44:58.97]Alright, let's get some music here.
[45:01.11]About, uh... Heavy metal mix?
[45:13.14]Let's see what we got on here.
[45:25.57]Otto is talking to you.
[45:30.03]Guys, there are two autos.
[45:32.01]There's auto the dog, and then auto the dog.
[45:34.91]Wait, how does that make any sense? ...
[45:56.01]Still need wings.
[45:56.69]Alright, I need a macro.
[45:59.37]How do I... How do I set... Can somebody paste into the chat the macro for when I do Shadow Bolt or when I do Immolate that the imp will just... that my pet will just attack.
[46:14.00]Alright, I got all the bat wings.
[46:23.56]Inventory is full.
[46:24.52]Oh, shit.
[46:25.03]Hold on.
[46:32.67]Show tooltip slash cast shadow bolt slash pet attack.
[46:41.32]Is that it?
[46:42.46]That's probably it.
[46:43.40]Cool.
[46:43.92]Okay.
[46:47.72]And it's like that.
[46:49.10]Like that.
[46:52.59]And we'll do... We need like a shadow bolt icon.
[46:59.91]Uh, spell, not item, spells.
[47:02.75]There it is, okay.
[47:07.27]Uh, pet, attack.
[47:09.47]Alright.
[47:17.87]Uh, wait, where is it?
[47:23.78]Um, huh?
[47:27.60]What's going on?
[47:34.42]It knew first.
[47:36.28]Oh.
[47:43.14]Oh, OK, there we go.
[47:49.49]Let's see if that did it.
[47:50.23]I think that should do it.
[47:50.89]You going?
[47:56.89]It didn't work.
[47:57.95]Each row needs to be separate.
[48:05.47]What do I do?
[48:07.81]Separate lines.
[48:10.27]Like this.
[48:13.41]Look at that.
[48:20.44]Okay.
[48:23.12]Hey, there we go.
[48:23.58]Alright, thank you.
[48:24.26]Alright, but we're all fired.
[48:28.11]That imp is... I'm getting the imp talent points.
[48:30.31]I don't care who screams at me.
[48:33.53]I want that imp to be doing more damage and I need to- I gotta sell shit.
[48:37.43]Hold on, where's the town?
[48:38.37]Over here.
[48:51.22]As if you're gonna get to level 10.
[48:53.36]I- you know what?
[48:54.08]Okay, I will guarantee you that I get to level 10.
[48:57.74]Today.
[48:58.10]I will get to level 10 today.
[49:01.40]Legitimately today.
[49:04.47]Joel in chat?
[49:06.13]Is Joel here?
[49:23.63]Is there a way so I don't get whispers?
[49:25.95]I don't care about getting whispers.
[49:27.45]It's just the blinking is like looking at a blinking light.
[49:32.33]Oh, can I do slash D&D?
[49:33.43]Will that stop it?
[49:34.03]I don't know.
[49:38.16]Separate your chat slash D&D.
[49:40.04]Will that do it?
[49:47.68]It will?
[49:48.04]Okay, I just did it.
[49:52.29]I apologize if somebody is writing something that didn't work.
[49:56.89]Make a separate whisper-only channel.
[49:59.31]Oh, okay.
[49:59.79]Okay.
[50:03.23]Uh, I imagine that's here.
[50:04.89]Is it interface or is it?
[50:15.38]I thought it was an interface.
[50:16.58]Where is it?
[50:19.90]It's on the chat itself.
[50:24.57]Oh, wait, hold on.
[50:25.61]Make unlock.
[50:30.05]Back here?
[50:30.75]Wait, hold on.
[50:32.17]Right click, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:33.71]Right click, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:35.43]Create new window.
[50:36.29]Block all invites?
[50:42.23]Yeah, I blocked all invites and trades already.
[50:45.61]No, go to social.
[50:52.31]Chat is now in Glorp mode.
[50:54.81]How do you put everything on one thing?
[50:56.48]Somebody knows.
[51:02.47]Uh, whispers and then chat options settings.
[51:14.69]Okay.
[51:15.73]Uh, this is for whispers and that's it, right?
[51:23.16]Will they all go here?
[51:35.70]Did I do it?
[51:38.14]Shit.
[51:40.46]Now turn off whispers in general.
[51:46.25]Oh, wait a minute.
[51:47.31]Okay.
[51:47.85]Whisper.
[51:48.61]Turn that off.
[51:51.77]Okay.

[52:43.44]Got it.
[52:47.11]Very cool.
[52:51.75]It's the little victories.
[52:52.87]How's the Hearthstone Battlegrounds stream going?
[53:02.47]Going good.
[53:02.91]I need to sell shit though, I have too much junk.
[53:12.05]It still blinks?
[53:14.03]Uh... I don't think you can turn that off.
[53:16.41]I can just cover it with a piece of tape.
[53:31.85]Cover it with a picture of Otto.
[53:33.74]Alright, I need to sell.
[53:43.25]Don't people like put stuff here?
[53:44.61]People do like a cam here.
[53:46.39]Well, I don't do cam.
[53:48.01]Sometimes I do.
[53:50.09]Alright, I need a vendor.
[53:51.33]Vendor.
[53:52.09]Does any vendor?
[53:52.84]Let's just take anything.
[53:54.70]I do need drinks as well.
[53:57.08]There we go.
[54:08.31]You're going to nuke the VOD?
[54:09.29]Oh, well, we'll turn it off sometimes.
[54:13.38]Alright, I get 63 cents.
[54:14.76]That's kind of huge.
[54:20.02]Oh, by the way, if something is gray, if it has gray text, it means it's worthless.
[54:28.94]Gray means just sell it.
[54:32.32]95% of the time.
[54:36.88]I need more of that though.
[54:44.91]okay one silver this shit's expensive for how low it is alright 15 uh I'll get to 20. I know a mage can just make water but probably not yet he's gonna have to restart his stream to fix it oh wait what happened oh should I look at try to look at mod chat
[55:23.54]Is everything good?
[55:32.73]We're good?
[55:33.09]Alright.
[55:33.69]Just making sure.
[55:35.21]I just saw VRJosh was like, he's going to have to restart the stream.
[55:38.17]And I was like, oh shit, what happened?
[55:41.25]Okay.
[55:43.89]Oh, you know what?
[55:49.06]I could do this too.
[55:54.95]What about that?
[55:58.53]I mean, that's the man now.
[56:04.82]It's alright, I'll just go like this sometimes.
[56:10.16]What do you need chat for?
[56:11.34]Don't disable us.
[56:16.72]I guess I could like turn it on when I want to use it.
[56:19.32]I'm OK with it right now.
[56:20.24]It's it's cool.
[56:28.04]If you delete the whisper window, you will ignore it completely.
[56:32.90]Is that true?
[56:35.74]Like, if I remove the window, it just won't be there?
[56:39.99]No, don't do that.
[56:40.57]Don't do that.
[56:41.41]Oh, okay.
[56:44.43]Wait, yeah, delete it.
[56:45.33]It says, hi, Jerma.
[56:53.29]You can bring it back.
[57:06.57]I gotta kill like 10 more of these.
[57:08.73]If you have Whisper on inline and they have no assigned window, they just won't pop up.
[57:16.68]Really.
[57:23.61]I think like that.
[57:28.01]I think that's good.
[57:37.02]I need to kill more of those skeletons.
[57:39.21]I need... Yeah, we're going for pure destruction.
[57:44.97]You get your first talent point at level 10.
[57:47.85]Talent points is where you pick the build of your character.
[57:51.73]You get points.
[57:54.24]Are you playing in windowed mode?
[57:59.24]Sometimes when I hit the button... Are you talking about the FPS drop?
[58:02.66]That's when I click out of the window.
[58:06.36]I just clicked that.
[58:07.66]I didn't mean to.
[58:14.71]Shadowbolt is destruction.
[58:15.73]That is very true.
[58:16.87]But the meta warlock is... Ooh, pants.
[58:24.34]The meta warlock is... I believe you do not go down the destruction tree at all.
[58:29.78]You go down enough to get ruin.
[58:32.12]And that's it.
[58:33.28]But I'm going even further than that.
[58:48.65]This person roleplaying auto is weird, champ.
[59:09.43]Ooh, dog.
[59:14.04]I thought that was somebody in chat and that's probably something that somebody would say.
[59:20.09]That was my imp.
[59:20.57]You're going to play Hello Neighbor?
[59:27.63]No.
[59:31.52]No, I can't think of anything I would rather do less than that.
[59:35.34]And that's not a... Careful here.
[59:38.64]It's your level 2.
[59:40.12]Help this person.
[59:40.96]There's a level 2 fighting a level 4.
[60:07.34]hey so you get it seven percent over there seven percent over there 28 copper well give me I want eight copper I blocked all trades can I trade with you
[60:37.32]Thank you.
[61:03.17]I gotta get out of, uh, I gotta get a death now.
[61:09.44]How many more do I need?
[61:10.00]I need three scavenger paws.
[61:12.94]I still need skeletons.
[61:13.74]I don't need bats anymore.
[61:17.60]And here's the thing.
[61:18.12]Those of you that are saying, oh, well, this seems very relaxing and easy.
[61:21.92]These are not aggressive enemies.
[61:25.14]If they have this kind of orange-yellow text, they are neutral.
[61:29.65]Which means they do not aggro to you.
[61:32.01]If these were red, this would just be running at me right now.
[61:35.03]If you get into aggro range, which is how most people die in this game, especially in hardcore, because they kind of just back up and aggro like three fucking wolves on the road and crossroads or something and they just die.
[61:47.44]But it just, that was just incredibly inefficient.
[61:49.52]And I'm, I apologize to anybody that plays this game.
[61:53.23]Because this is a dot.
[61:54.65]It's 25.
[61:55.45]You know what?
[61:55.83]Who cares?
[61:56.75]Just learn by experience.
[62:09.57]I didn't even look at what my imp's name was.
[62:10.87]You don't get to pick it.
[62:14.35]Jack Kwa.
[62:16.38]Jack Kwa is the imp's name.
[62:18.32]You do not get to name your pet.
[62:19.56]It does it automatically.
[62:20.50]Hunters can name their pets.
[62:21.96]When are you going to play Hello Kitty?
[62:30.93]Um, I don't know.
[62:31.43]I still, I got to finish Nancy Drew.
[62:33.33]That is a, ooh, nice little four.
[62:35.33]Okay.
[62:37.64]That's that.
[62:38.16]Let's go back here.
[62:39.66]Got to kill these skeletons.
[62:43.11]That's me.
[62:44.87]Skeletons.
[62:45.79]And then I got, it's level four, so I get new spells.
[62:47.87]Probably a new rank of, when do you get new shadow bullet rank?
[63:12.42]Probably just like level 10.
[63:17.58]I was killed.
[63:19.20]Oh no.
[63:26.45]Need.
[63:31.46]Still need these.
[63:31.98]There we go.
[63:41.23]Do I still owe a percentage?
[63:44.99]Unless it was previously discussed at the end.
[63:47.09]No.
[64:00.48]I need... How many more?
[64:03.62]Four more of these Rattlecage Skeletons.
[64:05.78]They only spawn in a couple plays.
[64:07.78]That's why this place sucks.
[64:11.10]Because there's only like five of these.
[64:13.52]And when you have like 50 people trying to kill five enemies, it becomes very difficult.
[64:21.85]I am alliance all the way.
[64:24.72]I'm so alliance biased.
[64:26.04]It's not even funny.
[64:36.95]That's lame.
[64:39.03]The alliance cities, the alliance music, the alliance starting zones, they're just better in every single conceivable way for me.
[64:56.76]That is a hot take.
[64:59.04]I don't know.
[65:00.08]Stormwind, I just love Stormwind.
[65:02.90]I also like Ironforge.
[65:04.15]I think that they're just easy to navigate.
[65:07.74]Ogremar is like, oh, you want to go get some training done?
[65:10.90]Okay, walk up there, go up the stairs, take a left, wrap around the corner, go down there, up, then go up, walk up another flight of stairs.
[65:17.67]Oh, by the way, that's on the fourth level.
[65:19.43]How do you get to the fourth level?
[65:20.45]Well, I don't fucking remember.
[65:25.43]Let alone getting your ass to the undercity.
[65:28.26]Like, no, who wants to be in there?
[65:29.16]Who wants to go there?
[65:33.21]You could say the same thing about Darnassus, but nobody goes to it.
[65:35.88]Darnassus is in total exile.
[65:38.72]I haven't been to Darnassus in probably 20 years on any character.
[65:43.63]It doesn't matter.
[65:44.54]Nobody goes there.
[65:57.00]We get postcards from Darnassus.
[66:00.18]We don't go there.
[66:00.78]It's fine.
[66:03.04]Unless you play Night Elf, which I don't usually play.
[66:14.22]Darnassus is lit in retail.
[66:17.40]Yeah, actually, I'm curious about that.
[66:19.55]I wonder.
[66:26.04]Hope you're having a good time.
[66:27.15]I'm having a good time.
[66:29.55]I don't know exactly how dedicated I'm going to be to this, but hey, if people are having fun and I'm having fun, then why not?
[66:38.09]I got no set plans or anything.
[66:40.43]This is better.
[66:40.81]This is way better.
[66:45.88]Finish Nancy Drew now, slacker.
[66:52.85]Do I not?
[66:54.27]Okay.
[66:57.01]Bring Samuel Phipps's remains to Marla's grave, then return to Novice Elrith.
[67:03.70]I think I'm about to be sent off into the real world here.
[67:08.54]This is the tutorial.
[67:10.18]When you get out of here, each race has a tutorial.
[67:18.54]A little zone in the zone.
[67:24.65]This one usually sucks as well because there's only like three or four places you can reliably get it.
[67:28.22]Everybody buy spells?
[67:39.05]Oh, that's right.
[67:39.77]Thank you.
[67:43.41]Oh, that was a lair.
[67:45.85]I'm okay for now.
[67:49.35]I think once we cross over 20 people, then yeah, it's probably time for a layer.
[67:55.67]I want to sell.
[67:56.45]Oh, these are better.
[68:14.65]New shoes.
[68:17.85]Yeah, okay, so you get strength, agility, stamina... Warlock is int, stamina, right?
[68:24.81]That's the priority?
[68:25.89]Spellpower, stamina, spellpower, int?
[68:30.62]We're not getting any adds?
[68:32.30]That's alright.
[68:33.92]I really do want to start doing the thing where I get up every hour, but... In the first little bit here, we can not have them for a moment.
[68:40.66]I kind of want to get out of the tutorial first.
[68:45.14]What is it?
[68:51.14]alright new spells alright this is always the most exciting part oh yep good move there's a dot I wish I could show you the talent trees because as many people are here that know this game a lot of people probably don't
[69:13.92]uh but this is affliction warlock is either dots big shadow bolt big conflagrate crits or demonology which is which is your pet maybe is what is demonology cool should I do demonology I feel like that's very survivable and hardcore demonology is the best
[69:43.94]Demon is sick as hell.
[69:45.00]Is Demon good?
[69:45.78]It's boring and classic, but it's good.
[69:49.18]Hard to master later.
[69:52.45]Uh, here comes the... And this is also a huge money sink.
[69:55.57]As you see, I've been playing for what?
[69:56.55]Like maybe 30, 40 minutes?
[69:58.21]45 minutes?
[69:59.37]That's all the money I made and it's all about to be gone.
[70:02.45]I can't even afford this.
[70:07.70]But that's alright.
[70:08.86]I got corruption.
[70:11.80]Corruption is 40 shadow damage over 12 seconds.
[70:14.50]This is, you want to do this second because you want to get that going, get this one going, then do shadow bolts.
[70:24.16]Although, kind of a waste of mana because by the time this ticks, it ticks every, what, three seconds?
[70:32.36]You might just kill it with shadow bolts and you just threw away 35 mana.
[70:35.68]So, I mean, whatever.
[70:39.99]Sick rotation.
[70:40.69]Thanks.
[70:44.03]You need to get your 7%.
[70:47.66]But just because?
[70:48.38]Like from everybody?
[70:53.70]Don't overdo it?
[70:55.16]No, I can't.
[70:57.92]And as I've gotten a little older and as, you know, I've had my own health problems here, I have to get up and move around and do stuff.
[71:07.54]So don't worry.
[71:09.74]I'm very much in tune with it at this point.
[71:13.56]Oh, there it is.
[71:15.06]I need this.
[71:15.72]Oh, Samuel's remains.
[71:16.82]What do you get though?
[71:17.52]I wish I could read that.
[71:18.87]Where do you get this?
[71:19.43]Spurred and undeath only to die at the hands of her now mindless husband.
[71:27.85]Ruined.
[71:28.43]Oh, okay.
[71:29.07]You got to go over there.
[71:37.13]Don't fuse to your chair.
[71:43.01]Where are these... Where are these supply crates?
[71:47.33]I've abandoned this quest every time.
[71:55.64]I've never done this one.
[72:00.99]Even 20 years ago.
[72:01.81]Finally, oh my god.
[72:11.63]And they only spawn in, what, five areas?
[72:15.22]Six areas?
[72:15.76]And if somebody picks it up, it disappears for like five minutes.
[72:34.13]Fifteen of them spawn.
[72:38.33]One where you have to kill the bandits and take their bandanas?
[72:40.37]Yeah, that sucks.
[72:42.17]Crate upstairs in that building?
[72:43.99]Ooh.
[72:48.85]I've got my own personal little sniffing dog.
[72:59.34]You look like your attack patterns are really parryable.
[73:01.74]No, no way.
[73:04.58]If I ever get in a fight with anybody, it's... I do the, like, Ludwig from Bloodborne.
[73:12.94]And not Phase 2, I'm talking Phase 1.
[73:19.30]Phase 1 Ludwig.
[73:26.77]No, no, no, I'm not... Oh, let's square up.
[73:28.53]And here we go, like, punch, punch, punch, uppercut, duck.
[73:32.46]Nope.
[73:32.80]It's... And it's fucking on all fours.
[73:36.91]And it's... Everything.
[73:39.03]Everything possible.
[73:42.11]We're fighting to fucking survive.
[73:43.23]You know what I mean?
[73:47.89]Whatever's on the... Anything.
[73:48.91]It doesn't matter what it is.
[74:01.46]Wasn't I just in here?
[74:02.20]I fucking hate this thing.
[74:06.70]I hate this quest.
[74:09.60]Yeah, I did just go in the same room three times, but whatever.
[74:11.84]I'll go across.
[74:21.81]I'm so far behind him.
[74:23.13]I should have been level five by now.
[74:34.87]You ran past them?
[74:37.71]Oh, can I get on your horse?
[74:44.74]Hey, who has the rocket ship?
[74:49.26]Oh, there's one.
[74:49.64]You should start a guild.
[75:04.44]Uh, no, no way.
[75:05.28]I love how everyone's just letting me get these.
[75:11.18]That's funny.
[75:12.26]Well, thank you.
[75:12.72]I appreciate it.
[75:15.36]You guys got to level up too.
[75:24.89]Everyone's very kind.
[75:29.09]Look how nice everyone's being.
[75:32.68]No, I can't tell if that's a way to... Hey, keep him playing WoW.
[75:39.15]We'll give him 7% of all of our money.
[75:41.11]All of our gold.
[75:41.81]Just stay here.
[75:51.25]Can we get the search bar function if you need it?
[75:53.19]And you can block trade.
[75:54.09]I did the block trades already.
[75:55.77]The search bar function.
[75:58.03]That's kind of a good idea.
[76:01.06]Do I have a belt yet?
[76:06.30]I don't.
[76:08.01]Okay, now we gotta go get the remains.
[76:20.45]Progress is non-linear?
[76:21.79]That's true.
[76:26.41]Yeah, you kind of, I think that's the best part about playing a game like this is you kind of can just do whatever.
[76:33.26]And I, I fought play, you know, let's be real for you.
[76:36.02]You want to be real with you?
[76:37.58]I fought playing this for like the last month.
[76:46.38]But I was just like, you know, I want to just chill.
[76:52.58]Play some Warcraft.
[76:54.90]Why not?
[76:56.06]What is... Hold my way.
[76:57.10]This guy's level 5.
[76:58.41]Hold on.
[76:58.65]This guy could actually kill me.
[76:59.47]Hold on.
[77:03.13]Let me do my new rotation.
[77:07.37]Perfect.
[77:07.73]Look at that.
[77:11.40]And that's how you play a fucking Warlock.
[77:14.82]Middle mouse button is an awful place for that.
[77:24.95]That's better.
[77:26.57]Alright.
[77:27.13]I got to kill Samuel Phipps.
[77:28.95]This guy's level five.
[77:30.61]He's incredibly dangerous.
[77:33.59]So let's get a little bit of aggro on the imp.
[77:39.39]I crit.
[77:39.73]That's bad.
[77:41.19]I'm dead.
[77:46.15]Wait, that's what you'll do, right?
[77:49.13]You got to say, oh, fuck, I'm dead.
[77:53.02]Dying is permanent.
[77:54.26]I want to reiterate that.
[77:55.74]A lot of people that watch my stream, if you're a WoW viewer and you're like, oh, let's go into the category.
[78:01.30]Trust me, I was doing that.
[78:04.07]Just jumping around.
[78:04.93]Oh, who's playing?
[78:05.89]Who's streaming?
[78:06.51]Oh, that's cool.
[78:09.09]A lot of people here probably don't know half the things that they're seeing, so forgive me for... Wait, did I not even pick it up?
[78:18.55]No, okay, I got it.
[78:19.10]I was like, wait, what?
[78:19.56]Let's go kill these spiders.
[78:30.92]Where's your health bar?
[78:31.88]Health bar is right here.
[78:33.89]Mana is right here.
[78:34.69]I only have 100 HP.
[78:36.79]Oh, how come nobody told me to reapply this?
[78:44.67]This is a big deal.
[78:45.73]Increase your armor by 40 and you get three health per five seconds.
[78:49.46]I only have 100 HP.
[78:51.36]That's a huge deal.
[78:54.86]Bro, I'm not playing this game.
[78:58.64]I didn't tell you to play it.
[79:06.81]Why are you such a tyrant?
[79:07.85]Alright, these things are level three.
[79:09.25]I'm about to be fine here.
[79:10.27]Honestly, I don't even need to do corruption at this point, but I need a wand too.
[79:18.36]Because I'm just going to blow through mana if I do that.
[79:23.34]Ooh, thank you.
[79:29.20]We'll stick to what I was doing before.
[79:30.38]Yeah, by the time one tick of corruption happens, this thing's dead already.
[79:46.53]pick up enchanting I don't yeah do I even want to do professions I don't even know on my other character I have professions but professions in hardcore are kind of scary because if you spend a bunch of time and money doing it if you die you lost all that progress it's almost like I want to get to a certain level before I care about it
[80:19.18]You have to get engineering.
[80:22.34]Yeah, engineering is... It's like the target dummies and all that, yeah.
[80:38.96]Jeremy, you fell off.
[80:41.40]Yeah, that's fine.
[80:42.80]Yeah, I hope so.
[80:56.75]Wait, somebody else said you're back on.
[80:58.41]We're good.
[81:01.80]You've improved?
[81:08.54]yeah uh well hold on wait till there is six or seven abilities on this bar and then let me get out of the tutorial first it's so easy to be like yeah immolate ah shadow bolt immolate shadow jump good got it nice good kill good kill it's easy to do that in the tutorial so let's get out of the tutorial first
[81:41.15]I got fucking mail.
[81:42.33]I wonder what that is.
[81:49.28]By the way, I'm going to make this very clear.
[81:51.92]I forgot to say this.
[81:57.42]If you send me like a thousand gold, I'm just sending it back to you.
[82:03.52]If you send me like, oh, hey, man, I'm going to send you like a fucking full set of epic items.
[82:07.49]I'm sending it right back.
[82:12.68]I want to struggle.
[82:13.62]I want the fucking... I want life to suck.
[82:17.22]I don't want... I don't want any money.
[82:18.50]I don't want any items.
[82:19.70]I want... I want my life to be fucking miserable.
[82:27.82]Are you doing self-found?
[82:29.86]Not self-found?
[82:34.36]More like... No handouts or whatever.
[82:39.47]I guess you could say that.
[82:41.55]Not like, hey, just take all this stuff for free.
[82:44.63]Like, yeah, sure.
[82:45.39]If I'm like, hey, does anybody have 10 silver?
[82:47.97]Like, whatever.
[82:49.81]Or, oh, you know, I really could use a couple of mana potions.
[82:53.96]Like, I don't care.
[82:54.70]That doesn't bother me.
[82:57.58]Okay, here we go.
[82:58.62]These people are going to die.
[83:00.84]Hi, Jerma.
[83:01.56]I just want to let you know, you're dead if you come.
[83:04.22]I probably shouldn't have even said anything.
[83:05.29]That would have been really funny.
[83:06.99]He's dead.
[83:07.97]This guy's dead in one hit.
[83:15.84]How did you not get any experience at all?
[83:23.50]You have to have gotten a tiny amount of EXP somehow.
[83:30.57]Just kill them both off.
[83:33.31]I don't know how long... Oh, I'm one kill away from leveling.
[83:37.17]Well, you should go kill something.
[83:38.87]You're going to die in here.
[83:45.72]And shit respawns.
[83:46.82]This is dangerous.
[83:48.22]Somebody's dying in here, by the way.
[83:51.13]What the fuck is this?
[83:54.29]Oh, uh... I will take one fish, please.
[84:08.84]Okay, making a meal for me.
[84:15.59]Okay.
[84:18.17]You trade.
[84:18.71]Okay.
[84:22.31]Yep.
[84:22.49]How much does this... What does it cost?
[84:25.19]Smoked sagefish.
[84:26.31]Oh, shit.
[84:26.83]Okay.
[84:30.11]No, that's insulting.
[84:31.53]That's insulting.
[84:35.53]That was also... That was even more insulting.
[84:39.53]Oh, shit.
[84:39.83]We're getting attacked.
[84:42.29]That's a handout?
[84:43.57]No, it's not.
[84:43.99]I paid for it.
[84:47.32]I paid, I paid for that.
[84:48.54]I mean, I got a pretty good, I got a pretty good rate for it, but I paid for it.
[84:55.36]Thank you so much.
[84:56.70]I appreciate it.
[85:01.54]Oh my God, this guy's dead.
[85:03.04]Alright, everybody be careful.
[85:03.96]That guy's getting, he's, this guy aggroing everything.
[85:08.73]He's trying to kill us all.
[85:09.45]Everyone run, run, run, run.
[85:10.41]He's trying to kill everybody.
[85:11.31]I just want to let everybody know that I think that guy just got all those mobs trying to kill us.
[85:28.34]You know what, guys?
[85:29.02]We're making a fucking group, okay?
[85:32.10]Like, everybody get in the group.
[85:34.74]Let's go.
[85:35.24]You know what?
[85:36.09]I'm not dying in here.
[85:40.67]I'm not dying.
[85:41.21]We're not going to die in here, okay?
[85:43.49]If we're going to be like this, we're going to be a group and we're going to do it together, okay?
[85:48.87]We have a level one with us.
[85:53.18]Hard to the foresee.
[85:56.32]This is like a level one instance.
[86:03.92]Imagine going to a dungeon as a level one.
[86:05.82]This dude's dead.
[86:07.06]And I'm actually looking forward to it.
[86:16.12]I hope someone's going to pull everything.
[86:20.05]I'm ready to run.
[86:24.21]Oh, it says they were not griefing.
[86:25.85]They were doing a Leroy Jenkins.
[86:27.29]Oh, okay.
[86:32.08]Careful pulling that stuff up there.
[86:33.52]And we're going to get back spawned on too.
[86:36.20]Okay, protect me.
[86:58.95]Stay behind me.
[87:05.82]Alright, yeah, I need to pee.
[87:08.38]We did the quest.
[87:10.98]It's time to get out of here.
[87:17.41]Everybody out.
[87:26.05]What's the best way to get out of here?
[87:31.52]Alright, somebody lead the way back out.
[87:32.82]Are you playing WoW again?
[87:42.57]I don't know if it's again.
[87:43.99]You're talking about like back in like 2017.
[87:47.47]2018 or something.
[87:49.83]Alright, congratulations Otto the dog has left the building.
[88:00.80]Okay, I gotta pee.
[88:03.04]I'll be right back.
[88:07.31]Thank you so much for all your help.
[88:08.63]You guys did a fantastic job.
[88:15.45]What's the safe way to do this?
[88:16.64]There really isn't.
[88:17.22]I guess nothing's here.
[88:18.06]Agro's, right?
[88:19.66]Otto is in trouble.
[88:20.48]Wait, is he going to die?
[88:22.14]No, he's not.
[88:22.90]What are you still doing in there?
[88:33.70]Alright.
[88:33.90]No, no, no.
[88:34.28]He's safe.
[88:34.62]He's safe.
[88:37.98]I'm okay.
[88:39.04]I crashed.
[88:42.02]Okay.
[88:42.38]I think it's safe.
[88:43.20]I don't think anything is aggressive out here, so I can just go BRB.
[88:46.72]We're going to do adds.
[88:49.53]So I'll be gone for a few minutes.
[88:53.69]I'll be right back.
[88:56.93]I guess it wouldn't be safe.
[88:58.29]No, let me go back to town.
[89:00.17]Because somebody could just grab a couple of spiders and just probably attack me.
[89:08.82]I want to get under the T as well, so.
[89:16.68]Yeah, that's why somebody said that's why hardcore is so terrifying.
[89:21.51]Because disconnects, if you DC in the middle of a fight, you're done.
[89:26.29]If you crash in the middle of a fight, done.
[89:29.01]And there is no, um, hey Blizzard, uh, am I in?
[89:32.43]No.
[89:32.87]It's just gone.
[89:33.91]There's no getting it back.
[89:34.63]Ooh.
[89:36.60]Shit, hold on.
[89:44.12]Okay.
[89:44.44]I'm safe in here.
[89:49.91]I will BRB.
[89:52.11]Ads are going to start playing.
[89:53.02]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[89:57.61]And see you soon.
[94:55.30]Okay.
[94:56.22]How are we doing?
[94:59.06]We go like this.
[94:59.88]Let's get back to it.
[95:07.93]Okay.
[95:13.77]I got a coffee.
[95:16.59]It's been a while.
[95:16.99]You know what?
[95:17.73]I don't really drink coffee on stream that much anymore.
[95:19.99]I noticed that.
[95:22.28]I switched to tea.
[95:29.64]Nothing like a nice, just a black coffee.
[95:31.96]Nothing in it.
[95:34.03]World of Warcraft.
[95:36.85]A nice hot, it's just nice hot black coffee.
[95:40.57]Level five, we're cruising.
[95:46.26]That's psychotic behavior.
[95:47.48]Oh my God, please.
[95:52.02]Yeah, I'll take my coffee and please put a bunch of sugary bullshit in it.
[95:55.46]Oh, I would like six tablespoons of sugar and like fucking five sweet and lows and fucking ten ounces of cream.
[96:03.44]No.
[96:05.64]We wake up in the morning.
[96:06.80]We brew that first cup.
[96:10.92]Fills the air with the aromatic beans.
[96:21.46]Do I have enough money?
[96:22.56]Yeah, I will now.
[96:23.88]What kind of coffee?
[96:29.76]I like Pete's coffee.
[96:31.38]Pete's beans are good.
[96:33.82]The medium blend Pete's is good stuff.
[96:37.36]I've been drinking it for years.
[96:39.44]I like Illy as well.
[96:43.63]Hold on, let me put this here.
[96:46.11]Yeah, Illy's great too.
[96:54.08]What the hell was that?
[97:03.59]What do you use to brew?
[97:05.83]I've used many machines over the years.
[97:07.73]Uh, I've used like a French press.
[97:12.28]I've used instant coffee.
[97:13.76]I've used when I've used like those big espresso machine type things.
[97:19.95]Years ago, I made an investment.
[97:23.25]And yep, I made a real investment.
[97:25.19]This thing was fucking expensive.
[97:28.43]But it was worth every dollar.
[97:29.77]Are you playing retail?
[97:33.24]Nah, this is classic hardcore.
[97:35.30]Alright, we gotta go Scarlet Armbands.
[97:44.58]Fuck, I didn't sell anything.
[97:49.43]Uh, so years ago, this is probably like five or six, seven years ago now.
[97:54.15]I've had this thing for a long time.
[97:56.23]I have a Jura.
[97:58.77]I have one of the, not one of the higher end models.
[98:01.78]I have one of the kind of lower to mid tier models.
[98:05.92]I used to go to Dunkin' Donuts.
[98:07.84]I used to go to Starbucks every single day.
[98:11.46]And it added up.
[98:15.25]You have a Jerma.
[98:16.87]It's Jura.
[98:17.63]J-U-R-A.
[98:18.52]Um...
[98:22.51]These things are like a thousand dollars.
[98:24.19]They're ridiculous.
[98:25.99]It's one of the most expensive fucking appliances.
[98:28.85]Like, at least table, uh, countertop.
[98:31.81]Um... But... Over the last five, six, seven years... I've probably saved two or three thousand dollars, maybe even five thousand dollars worth of coffee.
[98:43.44]Think about it.
[98:44.22]Going to the drive-thru.
[98:44.98]I was going to the drive-thru every, every day, every other day.
[98:48.16]Before streams.
[98:50.06]I would just go to Dunkin Donuts.
[98:51.52]I would go to Starbucks and now, yeah, give me this, this, this.
[98:53.90]And it was like eight bucks, seven bucks, right?
[98:56.17]You do that every single day for a year.
[99:02.43]It adds up over years, but this machine has definitely paid itself back like three times already.
[99:06.63]I don't want to throw shit away that I can use.
[99:16.59]I need more bags too.
[99:21.36]Oh, I don't have a chest piece on.
[99:24.18]This thing was just like a three armor piece of crap.
[99:26.16]Okay, cool.
[99:27.18]Alright, do I look like a dickhead?
[99:34.65]Let's see.
[99:35.79]Eh, I look alright.
[99:39.13]Penny saved is a penny earned.
[99:44.27]How come your UI is so big?
[99:47.45]because I can't see.
[99:49.65]I need everything to be zoomed in.
[99:53.23]Okay, the experience you're going to get on this stream, I just want to make sure I'm very clear on this.
[99:58.71]It's going to be like if you peeked over watching your dad play.
[100:03.86]And you'd kind of like, hey, nice job, dad.
[100:09.10]He's dead.
[100:09.82]He's dead in less than like a few days.
[100:13.50]That's fine.
[100:14.22]That's not going to happen.
[100:18.86]I'm going to live.
[100:20.26]And I'm going to get to level 60.
[100:24.07]Maybe.
[100:25.37]Definitely not.
[100:33.27]I don't know what it would take for me to really like go all in on this.
[100:36.10]I don't know.
[100:38.54]I'm so conflicted about it because it is one thing, I have like a lot of games that I still want to play, but I want to play this one too.
[100:49.17]And I know like a lot, especially like think of the Only Fang stuff, right?
[100:52.47]That's still going and like people really haven't still fun with it, but like the title of the stream says, I kind of... Like, hey, look, I'm level one.
[101:03.52]Like, alright, let's go.
[101:05.04]Like they're going to do BW well, like in the next probably few weeks or next month or two, right?
[101:16.72]And like, what about like, would you join a guild or any guild or that one or another one?
[101:21.80]I don't know.
[101:26.95]I love the idea of doing this.
[101:29.65]I just need to make sure I actually want to.
[101:32.45]Does that make sense?
[101:45.16]Did you watch Tyler1's journey?
[101:46.74]I did.
[101:49.03]That was... It was great.
[101:50.99]It was a full clapping, standing ovation for the whole arc.
[102:01.73]I remember I was there when people didn't think Tyler1 was going to get to level 10.
[102:04.53]Level 20.
[102:05.95]There's no way he's ever going to be in a dungeon.
[102:09.51]He's going to die in Shadowfang Heap.
[102:11.22]He didn't.
[102:12.06]He's going to die out in the open in the Barrens.
[102:14.82]He didn't.
[102:15.16]There's no way.
[102:17.78]He proved everybody wrong.
[102:21.50]He made great content, so that's good.
[102:25.71]Okay, careful here.
[102:27.27]We have a band of fucking weirdos, but that's fine.
[102:33.70]Oh God.
[102:34.08]Oh God.
[102:34.40]Okay.
[102:34.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:35.22]Be careful.
[102:36.82]He's level five.
[102:38.18]It's not a big deal.
[102:38.92]We got five people.
[102:41.02]Nah, we're fine.
[102:41.98]Nobody's going to die.
[102:42.76]Make sure you get the... Did we not get credit for that?
[102:51.77]Wait, did we even have to kill that guy?
[102:52.99]I don't even have a... Do I have any quests for here?
[102:56.49]It's just the armbands.
[102:57.67]Okay.
[103:03.10]that's a different group you don't have the quest you probably get it I see this is the that happens right if I was here alone if you're here by yourself or even with one other person if that happens you're just dead you you have to run certain classes can handle that like level five level three like two level fives three level fives for a lot of people you're just dead
[103:27.88]I happen to be very privileged and am surrounded by people willing to throw themselves in front of a car.
[103:37.02]That's not the case for... See?
[103:38.66]Look what just happened.
[103:39.46]See that?
[103:39.74]Need a lot more of these.
[103:54.51]I'm just doing shadow bolts now.
[103:55.67]There's no reason to do anything else.
[103:58.59]Enemies will hyperspawn.
[103:59.65]Yeah, especially when you get a lot of people in the same area.
[104:04.36]This is going to take forever.
[104:05.86]We have five people doing this one quest, I think.
[104:10.62]We need 12.
[104:11.58]How many?
[104:11.84]We need like 60 armbands.
[104:19.68]Are we even going to be able to collect like 70 armbands?
[104:24.07]You're the only person on the quest.
[104:25.39]Oh, actually, let me do this.
[104:27.84]Let's do free-for-all loot.
[104:30.38]Easier just to pick them up.
[104:36.26]Otherwise it will do like a group rolling algorithm of some kind.
[104:39.69]Gonna drink.
[104:54.62]I thought you loved the struggle.
[104:57.73]After getting out of this zone is usually when the numbers will probably dwindle a little because it is hardcore and far fewer people are going to have like a level 10, 20, 30 than a level one.
[105:14.43]It's a lot harder to actually get through into like the teens and 20s.
[105:22.41]You don't have auto loot on?
[105:25.75]I don't know what that is.
[105:30.57]Would you recommend this game to anybody?
[105:32.89]No.
[105:34.15]Well, it depends.
[105:36.83]Do you value the rest of your life?
[105:43.88]Because from here on out, World of Warcraft is going to be a part of it in some fashion.
[105:54.37]Wicked!
[105:57.69]And I'm telling you this because I played this game for the first time 25 fucking years ago.
[106:06.13]And it still gets me.
[106:08.37]It still does it.
[106:10.61]Still.
[106:17.56]So if you're willing, well, and I don't know, you might open it and be like, this game sucks fucking asshole.
[106:22.06]And you might not play it ever again.
[106:23.82]Oh, let's roll for the chest.
[106:25.82]Let's roll for the chest.
[106:31.17]Oh, okay.
[106:32.83]73, 47, 35.
[106:34.03]Oh.
[106:36.25]Anybody else?
[106:40.74]Okay.
[106:43.04]33.
[106:43.18]Okay.
[106:44.02]I think I get it.
[106:44.62]Unless maybe some people don't know how to roll.
[106:51.08]But give me this mine.
[107:00.13]I'm not even- I don't even want anything in there.
[107:01.85]What a- why would you keep all that shit in here?
[107:08.37]Imagine putting a- a old shitty belt in like a dirty, like smelly piece of cheese in a chest.
[107:24.92]You want a bag?
[107:26.82]Is it like a little bag?
[107:30.39]No, no, I'm good.
[107:31.35]I'm good.
[107:34.75]I have to adhere to my... I'm not taking any free things.
[107:52.48]Sell it for one silver?
[107:54.66]That makes some money.
[107:55.96]Yeah, this is a game about making money.
[107:58.44]Everyone thinks World of Warcraft is a game about fighting monsters.
[108:01.61]No, it's about making money.
[108:05.61]Getting a profession, getting herbalism, potions, auction house, selling, flipping, flipping houses.
[108:13.33]It's about money, okay?
[108:14.57]It's not about, oh, the adventure.
[108:16.55]What?
[108:22.91]No, it's about buying up two or like 20 stacks of tangy clam meat, listing them on the auction house for 10 silver more.
[108:33.78]Flippin' markets.
[108:34.54]Alright, I got them all.
[108:47.06]Is there more on that one if anybody has any?
[108:52.14]Okay.
[108:53.58]That's it, right?
[108:54.00]I'm probably going to get the quest to go kill this guy.
[108:55.46]Why is there a baby seal?
[109:00.56]That is for my pet to not do anything.
[109:02.43]It will not attack anything unless I say directly, please do it.
[109:08.13]Am I going to be level six after this?
[109:09.31]I wonder.
[109:11.73]All the way from the barrens.
[109:12.67]Alright.
[109:15.40]Well, what is it?
[109:18.85]All the way here.
[109:19.77]Oh, okay.
[109:22.80]That is a lot.
[109:23.46]By the way, I want everyone to understand, if he didn't have the flight path, it took him like an hour and a half to get here.
[109:30.24]And a big typo.
[109:33.54]Oh, you got all the way here and that was a typo.
[109:36.42]Shit.
[109:39.40]It took like an hour and a half to get here.
[109:58.44]I did that with I tapped that with one hand actually I don't like pineapple on pizza I just I just want to make sure everyone's having a good time you know what I mean like I fucking hate pineapple on pizza I'm just making sure people are all having a good time okay
[110:27.02]I'll take it.
[110:31.69]Alright.
[110:33.41]Now we gotta kill Mevin.
[110:34.53]I think that's the guy that we saw before.
[110:36.89]Ooh.
[110:39.19]Not quite level 6.
[110:39.75]I think that is back... Yeah, it is where we just were.
[110:47.18]Centrist Andy.
[110:48.32]Hahaha.
[110:52.46]That's not what you said a couple of years ago.
[110:54.06]I just told you, I think pineapple on pizza is bad.
[110:57.05]Are you trying to trade with me?
[111:01.79]What are you trading?
[111:03.01]Oh, they're not even in this group.
[111:06.25]By the way, I guess I just selected these.
[111:08.09]These are the random people.
[111:09.25]I guess you guys have been, are now the group, I guess.
[111:15.94]At least for now.
[111:20.28]I might drop group and solo after this.
[111:25.24]But I'm here for now.
[111:27.06]Let's be careful.
[111:27.70]Did you play Diablo II Remastered?
[111:31.69]Yeah, I love that game.
[111:34.91]If it's a Blizzard game and it came out before like 2006, I'd probably love every single second of it.
[111:41.47]I'd probably spend so much of my time playing it.
[111:43.31]Alright, we gotta wait for the spawn.
[111:56.70]What about Delta Ruined?
[111:59.42]Um... I don't know.
[112:02.71]Probably not.
[112:05.17]I would have to redo the whole thing.
[112:13.83]Would you consider this a relapse?
[112:17.27]Um... This is before I was born.
[112:29.57]Start from chapter three.
[112:34.00]Careful, there's people behind us.
[112:40.40]Yeah, I'm one of those people that I forget.
[112:43.35]Even like Dark Souls.
[112:44.49]This is pretty with all media.
[112:46.25]I don't think there's ever been a piece of media that this hasn't happened with.
[112:50.49]You just forget the whole thing after a few years.
[112:53.53]Which means, oh, I can do the whole thing again and it's fun and it's new and fresh.
[112:58.70]I, like, forget everything I've ever said and ever done as of, like, five years ago.
[113:04.62]There he is.
[113:06.16]Oh, we can't... Oh, too bad.
[113:07.12]He can't get you in the group.
[113:12.38]Alright, there's that.
[113:14.10]Secret documents.
[113:25.23]That's not... I mean, I'm fucking around.
[113:26.79]I...
[113:30.65]You guys take two things I'm saying too, literally.
[113:32.33]We got Demon Skin?
[113:49.51]I got it on there.
[113:54.41]Monster Hunter Wilds?
[113:56.91]Yeah, I think we were talking about playing it.
[114:05.54]I got a sponsor offer to do it, but I don't know if I'm going to do the sponsor.
[114:09.38]I think we're just going to play it.
[114:10.68]I don't know.
[114:11.06]Unless like we can kind of get everybody on it or something.
[114:17.33]Level six.
[114:22.22]Remember, patience, discipline.
[114:33.42]I don't have any money.
[114:34.88]I have 2 silver, 40 copper.
[114:40.01]There it is.
[114:40.39]Alright, Shadowbolt rank 2.
[114:43.75]13 to 18, it goes... That's a double.
[114:48.93]This one's dangerous and hardcore.
[114:55.28]You've got 30 years of gaming experience.
[114:57.34]Yeah.
[114:59.64]Across multiple consoles.
[115:11.23]I don't need life tap yet.
[115:14.15]I'm regening so much anyways.
[115:15.41]Okay, but we need to put that on.
[115:19.72]Curse of weakness that goes on the remember these are all clicks.
[115:22.02]Alright, it's taking rank too.
[115:26.06]Usually you have to go in your spell book and bring the other rank down, but I guess it's just doing it automatically.
[115:30.47]Okay.
[115:38.82]That's good.
[115:39.92]Yeah, curse of weaknesses.
[115:42.30]It's a debuff you put on somebody.
[115:45.29]And they will do three less damage for two minutes.
[115:51.09]It's pretty useful.
[115:55.99]Only because of the macro?
[115:56.79]Yeah, that's true.
[115:58.45]Alright, it's time to get out of the tutorial zone.
[116:02.12]We're doing this.
[116:02.76]We'll go down the road.
[116:06.86]I need to deliver this.
[116:11.23]lex lex lux leather where are you I don't know where you are oh it's vrath Chris there's only two of us
[116:42.41]Take my blessing.
[116:43.67]Battle to the death for the real Kris.
[116:47.03]No!
[116:52.21]What has- what has become of you?
[116:55.77]For real though, you gotta take my gifts because I gotta go eat.
[117:03.14]I'll fight him in Chaos Kris's stead.
[117:07.58]What, what are you, what are you trying to give?
[117:08.78]What do you, what do you want to get?
[117:09.74]I, I, okay.
[117:10.60]I, I, I don't want to take anything.
[117:13.06]Let me see how valuable this is.
[117:18.97]Oh shit.
[117:19.63]Okay.
[117:21.13]I, I, okay.
[117:21.93]I'll, I'll, I can't, I can't, I can't, I got, I'll take, okay.
[117:26.61]I'll take the, can I take the wand?
[117:30.95]I'll take the wand.
[117:33.25]That's cheating.
[117:33.87]No health.
[117:34.31]You can't take health.
[117:35.68]Can I have the wand?
[117:37.16]Just the wand.
[117:40.02]And I'm gonna pay for it, too.
[117:41.14]Look.
[117:43.20]I don't even have 50 copper?
[117:44.32]What the fuck?
[117:48.38]This is a handout, Andy.
[117:49.50]Handout.
[117:50.69]Is it a handout?
[117:51.61]Or did I just... Level 10 enchanting.
[117:53.91]Take it.
[117:54.15]He's gonna starve to death.
[117:54.95]Okay, I'm paying for it.
[117:55.81]Look, 25 copper.
[117:56.61]I got a good discount.
[117:57.59]Whatever.
[117:57.77]I don't care.
[117:58.05]Who cares?
[117:58.25]Who cares?
[118:04.66]That's the only time I'm gonna take anything, okay?
[118:06.94]Cause like, I don't wanna go fucking get one of these.
[118:10.60]I'd have to like, run to fucking Undercity and get one of these.
[118:13.20]Just pretend I ran- okay, I paid for it.
[118:17.01]I got more gear, hold on.
[118:21.77]Yeah, it's like a- it's the enchanting wand, I'll be good.
[118:26.03]Got a new blade.
[118:27.14]Does it look any better?
[118:34.66]Oh, I can't put on the staff.
[118:35.84]Not like it matters.
[118:41.76]Well, this is a big town up here anyways, but I actually I appreciate it.
[118:44.84]Thank you.
[118:46.85]Thank you for the wand.
[118:51.81]This is a this is a cheating run.
[118:53.49]You need to restart.
[118:58.45]Oh, I gotta bind.
[119:00.85]Shoot.
[119:03.08]So wands, for those that don't know, wands are insane in this game.
[119:10.99]This wand is going to do more damage than my shadow bolt will.
[119:16.05]One and a half seconds, 12 to 22 damage every one and a half seconds.
[119:18.77]This is two and a half, almost two and a half seconds to cast it.
[119:22.35]And this is free.
[119:26.68]He's cheating.
[119:27.36]I'm not cheating.
[119:28.04]I bought that wand fair and square.
[119:32.42]Ah, this is kind of nice.
[119:35.38]I could... I could get used to this.
[119:37.44]I could get used to this.
[119:40.38]I kind of like this.
[119:41.28]Oh, you still need to kill those bats.
[120:02.77]Oh, be careful with this guy.
[120:14.25]Oh.
[120:16.87]Do you think you can do it?
[120:18.07]Do you have this quest?
[120:21.89]This is a rogue quest.
[120:25.17]I don't have it.
[120:28.67]Oh, no.
[120:30.22]How do you get it?
[120:32.31]Deliver the nondescript letter.
[120:34.05]Oh, okay.
[120:37.33]I was just zoomed in.
[120:45.51]That guy's going to stab you in the back?
[120:47.25]It's possible.
[120:48.39]You can't trust anybody in hardcore.
[120:53.88]Wait a minute.
[120:54.26]He wants to fight.
[120:59.44]How do I get this thing off my head?
[121:03.37]I want to be able to see this.
[121:06.27]We've been... This person's been with us the whole time.
[121:11.08]This is a level 3 to the death fight.
[121:13.74]Remember, whoever loses this, their character is deleted.
[121:17.66]You don't get to come back.
[121:20.74]Uh oh.
[121:25.49]Let's go no... HUD or no HUD?
[121:30.05]I want to see the health bars.
[121:33.07]oh no he kind of knows how to play though oh no he's gone well fought too bad too bad wrath Chris you fought very valiantly
[122:01.23]You're also a warrior, so that's kind of cheating.
[122:04.67]Everybody knows that warriors are 500% better than all the other classes combined.
[122:10.54]But that leaves us a spot here.
[122:14.88]Thank you, HiGerman, for playing.
[122:20.90]Steal 10 pumpkins from the farm to the west.
[122:24.10]What are you doing?
[122:31.51]You're gonna get yourself killed.
[122:32.33]What, in a level 5?
[122:37.61]At level 1 you have... You could like stab somebody.
[122:41.76]No, no, no.
[122:42.18]Don't do that.
[122:42.58]Don't do that.
[122:43.02]Don't do that.
[122:43.40]That's actually... That's a... The character's level 36.
[122:45.54]It's not worth it.
[122:46.78]It's not worth it.
[122:54.76]Well, I can't... Like that... If you... That's a lot of time investment.
[122:58.08]Don't... Don't do that.
[122:59.28]That's... That's gonna be sad.
[123:08.86]I would feel so bad.
[123:09.80]That takes... Okay, to get to level 36... That's a pretty significant commitment.
[123:19.28]That's like at least a week or more of casually playing this game.
[123:25.22]Wait, should I get... Let's get the other... Yeah, let me get the other quest here.
[123:35.06]I have... I currently have a character that's like level 30.
[123:39.03]And that was casually playing over, like, a month.
[123:47.45]What about getting to level 60 in a day?
[123:52.33]Can't you do mob tagging and get to 60 in, like, two days?
[123:56.93]You have to do it 24-7, though.
[123:59.25]I would go crazy.
[123:59.85]I wouldn't be able to do that.
[124:04.14]Where is he?
[124:04.48]He walks... Oh, that's his path here.
[124:07.16]He can be on this road here.
[124:11.67]Well, let's go to... What is it?
[124:14.07]What town is this up here?
[124:24.38]What's mob tagging?
[124:25.38]Mob tagging is... I have a very, very small understanding of what it is because I've never done it.
[124:32.63]mob tagging is where you go to a place where there's a ton of enemies and you aggro like 50 things and do enough damage to them while a group of people keep you alive and then when you do I believe 30 damage to all the enemies the whole group kills everything and you get all the experience where's he going oh be careful here this is what was he fighting something
[125:06.28]And it is very, very mind-numbing.
[125:10.44]Invite?
[125:11.02]Eh, sure.
[125:11.36]Why not?
[125:11.54]Whatever.
[125:11.84]Alright, we need... Yeah, they're everywhere.
[125:19.27]Pick up the gloomweeds.
[125:26.51]It actually is time to start being a little more careful.
[125:29.25]Just because... I mean, there are a lot of people here.
[125:32.70]Oh, I didn't even talk about the wand.
[125:33.84]Oh, I did.
[125:34.28]I didn't show it.
[125:37.27]You need to level it up first.
[125:45.73]Alright, let's go.
[125:46.31]Let me get to the town.
[125:47.13]I'll get all these quests.
[125:54.66]You're too zoomed out on the mini map.
[125:56.24]I do that because I need to see a big picture.
[126:01.82]If I don't get to see the big picture, it freaks me out.
[126:11.83]What realm is this?
[126:12.67]This is Doom Howl?
[126:16.35]It's the one that all the streamers are playing on.
[126:17.83]Hardcore anniversary.
[126:27.08]Why is there a skull emoji?
[126:32.42]I think people can put it on me.
[126:35.81]I think they're doing... I think that's to show everybody where I am.
[126:39.11]Because there's like a sea of people, I think, and... I think just a way to see it.
[126:42.83]Dude, don't say your realm on stream.
[126:55.28]What the fuck?
[126:58.18]Hmm?
[127:00.26]Why not?
[127:08.83]Putrid Claws.
[127:11.09]Okay.
[127:21.16]You ever play PoE 2?
[127:22.08]I did play PoE 2.
[127:23.32]It was very fun.
[127:26.60]Like I said the other day, I just, I'm just going to wait until a sword can be picked up on the ground.
[127:36.89]Because as of right now, there's not even a sword in the game.
[127:41.79]So, and I keep emphasizing that as like a big gotcha point of why I'm not playing, but it's true.
[127:51.56]I think it's wonderful, though.
[127:52.64]I think the gameplay loop is really fun.
[127:54.08]I think the classes seem really interesting.
[127:56.62]I played through, I think, the whole campaign.
[128:00.91]I enjoyed it a lot.
[128:01.55]I thought it was very, very good.
[128:02.79]I love the unique items.
[128:03.79]I love that there is tons of weird, cool builds to do.
[128:06.95]Oh, yeah, it's great.
[128:08.55]I'm just going to wait until it's in the oven for, like, honestly, honestly, probably, like, six more months, I think, because then I'll, like, really probably come back to it.
[128:16.52]Do not seek death.
[128:20.49]Okay, I need... Did I get anything better?
[128:46.04]This stream is very fun.
[128:50.04]Well, if I figured just turn it on and we can relax and play some World of Warcraft.
[128:58.99]I don't really care about this.
[129:00.27]I'd rather have the money.
[129:07.83]15 years ago, you made a Tommy Sloth tutorial and it did not help me in the slightest.
[129:12.46]Otto, what's the matter?
[129:15.06]Well, but remember that's 15 years ago like the game knowledge of most people was much lower so like you could have gone to my channel back like 10 20 years ago and Gotten some guys.
[129:27.27]I did us how to strafe tutorial Like there was a there was a very it was a much simpler time I Was telling people that like hey if you do ad ad you can be very I called it I called it the sway I
[129:46.23]That's before I, I don't know, nobody knew what the fuck we were doing.
[129:50.97]And I probably was already like two or three years late to strafing.
[129:54.43]Everybody knew that already.
[129:55.65]It's just us fucking idiot YouTubers.
[130:02.92]Yeah, I invented the sway.
[130:10.16]Those videos, those videos, yeah, those videos are all still there.
[130:16.22]You can go watch my terrible fucking tutorials from when I was like 25, like 24.
[130:22.21]How old was I?
[130:27.63]Like 25?
[130:29.13]It was like at least 12, 13 years ago.
[130:31.05]Are you hungry?
[130:32.75]Is that the problem?
[130:35.99]It is kind of getting close to... Actually, it's still kind of early, but... Smite tutorials were peak content.
[130:45.89]God.
[130:47.83]Smite Alpha, when the game was being patched every two or three weeks.
[130:52.53]And so everything that you said in those videos was completely inaccurate.
[130:57.33]Even a day or two later sometimes.
[130:58.98]Alright, this thing's level 10.
[131:01.22]This is the, what is it, Magadi?
[131:07.56]Check your mailbox.
[131:09.12]I'm afraid to check my mailbox.
[131:11.74]Alright, this is a boss.
[131:12.62]This is a non-elite boss.
[131:22.65]Okay, let me see here.
[131:24.33]That should be good.
[131:25.07]Let me turn that.
[131:30.05]You getting hungry, dog?
[131:30.75]Alright, in a minute or so, I'm going to get up and I'm going to feed Otto.
[131:34.74]Because this is an I'm hungry voice.
[131:37.42]Alright, let's check the mail.
[131:42.20]See what it says.
[131:43.04]Let's see if there's like a thousand gold in this mailbox.
[131:46.44]It's funny because in my mind,
[131:50.26]I almost feel like, hey, oh shit, I sent him a thousand gold.
[131:54.25]Fuck, that's lost forever unless he sends it back.
[131:57.49]Oh my god.
[132:03.77]Yeah, I don't, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[132:05.83]Refund?
[132:09.36]This is, I gotta send, okay, if I don't open these, will they just get it back?
[132:22.19]No, it takes 30 days?
[132:25.19]Fuck, that's a lot of- that's a lot of money in there, man.
[132:28.78]I gotta stay honest, though.
[132:29.82]I gotta- but I don't wanna, like, send shit back.
[132:31.72]I'm not- okay.
[132:32.72]I'm not gonna sit here and, like, process returns all day.
[132:36.16]Alright, I got- Left click and then hit return?

[133:44.43]I can't, I can't, I can't.
[133:47.99]Let me feed auto and I'll be back in a few minutes.
[133:53.46]We'll get some music on the BRB.
[133:54.82]I might be gone for like five minutes.
[134:01.52]Take it.
[134:01.98]Take it.
[134:02.32]I can't.
[134:03.62]I don't want to have like 50 gold.
[134:05.08]We're back.
[135:18.43]So,
[136:48.64]Amen.
[138:12.27]Welcome back.

[138:15.18]Otto is finishing up his food.
[138:18.03]And I'll be back in another minute or two.
[138:19.37]See you in a minute.
[139:15.99]Thank you.
[140:31.32]Okay, let me move this.
[140:41.68]And we are back.
[140:45.26]Okay, so what was I doing?
[140:47.39]Alright, I gotta go through my mail.

[140:57.59]My god.
[140:58.97]Each moment spent with you has been a treasure I'll carry with me always.

[142:28.31]Oh, I'm level six though.
[142:30.44]I need.
[142:30.78]Yeah, there's a warlock trainer in here.
[142:36.40]Did I buy anything?
[142:38.72]Wait, where the fuck is this guy?
[142:43.72]Where is this person?
[142:47.16]Oh, that's the cup vendor.
[142:51.16]That's not a book.
[142:51.76]I think they're upstairs.
[142:57.99]Gray means I'm not quite high enough to pick it up.
[143:04.07]For a second, I thought I just had tinnitus.
[143:11.17]Oh, there you are.
[143:14.13]There's a demon trainer too.
[143:15.44]Alright, life tap.
[143:18.32]no I don't I don't want him I don't want it yet blood pact I do want this so you have to buy books for your little minions and I'm what I'm gonna teach him now is well not that okay uh I'm gonna teach my imp blood pact blood pact is a very good move there it is ding
[143:46.71]Uh, anybody that's in my group gets, uh, extra stamina.
[143:50.22]Two stamina is, uh, one stamina is 10 health, by the way.
[143:54.20]That's all that does.
[143:55.62]So that's 20 extra HP.
[143:58.42]That's pretty significant.
[143:59.18]It's about 5, what, 5% of total health pool.
[144:02.20]This increases as you level up, you get better books.
[144:08.36]Blood pact is a beta move.
[144:12.77]Yeah, for him.
[144:16.15]You don't think that's the alpha?
[144:17.55]Like, you're giving me your stamina.
[144:21.46]Not for me!
[144:27.50]My minion is giving that stamina to me, not vice versa.
[144:34.33]Okay.
[144:35.05]I think we're good.
[144:36.25]I think I'm ready.
[144:42.69]It's time to go.
[144:43.37]I want to go up here.
[144:45.44]What level is this shit up here?
[145:00.20]It's always, this is always so funny to me because like imagine needing to come here with this many people to kill a handful of bugs.
[145:18.51]This is like a class field trip.
[145:26.79]Oh, you got mage water?
[145:29.87]Oh, you just got water.
[145:31.57]Oh, hell yeah.
[145:34.43]So mages can make mana water so you don't have to buy it anymore?
[145:38.19]Oh, that's huge.
[145:39.25]Thank you.
[145:39.59]I'm going to hold on to these and drink these if I can get rid of this.
[145:46.64]I'm not going to drink that.
[145:52.70]We can totally beat the level 10 guy, by the way.
[145:55.58]Uh, yeah, I think... I don't think we're gonna have that much trouble.
[145:57.62]Alright, we gotta kill grave robbers.
[146:05.48]Grave robbers and then... I think these spider... spider ichor?
[146:09.75]Well, we're already getting... people are already killing it.
[146:11.51]Alright, these things are level 7, so we... this is... this is danger zone.
[146:23.81]You know, it's probably... I should just wand.
[146:25.11]Oh, there we go.
[146:31.69]I won right off the bat.
[146:32.35]Nice.
[146:35.81]Yeah, I gotta level up the wands anyway, so I'm just gonna wand.
[146:41.93]What is happening I don't understand.
[146:43.55]Um, it's been 25 years.
[146:47.67]And there are lots of things that I still don't understand either.
[146:52.17]You're not alone.
[147:03.97]Invite me.
[147:04.47]I have power word shield.
[147:06.27]Hey dude, actually that's worth having in the party because that's a priest.
[147:16.08]What do we have in the party?
[147:17.16]No, we have a priest.
[147:17.84]Yeah, we got a priest.
[147:19.40]We have two priests.
[147:20.50]We got plenty of priests.
[147:25.30]I feel bad for the people that are just trying to quest over here because we just come here with like our fucking field trip.
[147:36.62]nice yeah there's no rhyme or reason to who's even tagging these honestly what's the max uh 30 okay a magic school bus yeah
[148:11.02]I'll tell you, we're going to start seeing people dropping like flies soon though.
[148:21.79]Dude, you're too close to the mic.
[148:24.89]Lots of... Oh, really?
[148:27.23]I got a new thing on.
[148:28.13]Oh, fuck.
[148:28.49]Hold on.
[148:40.17]You talk about, like, the p-p-p-p-p, right?
[148:44.47]I put a new, like, wind guard on this today.
[148:47.71]Is it worse?
[148:49.13]Is it not good?
[148:52.39]I hate that stuff, too, though.
[148:53.49]I hate that shit.
[148:59.94]Like, Peter Piper picked pickled peppers, right?
[149:04.20]You hear, like, the p-p-p-p-p.
[149:08.62]I did put a new pop filter on today.
[149:11.48]Alright.
[149:21.91]Alright, hold on.
[149:24.54]Just protect me.
[149:25.16]I'm going to put the old one on.
[149:26.08]I'll be right back.
[149:26.96]Two seconds.
[149:58.11]Okay.
[149:59.73]Yeah, I hate that shit too.
[150:03.63]Trust me, I know what you mean by that.
[150:05.31]I don't like it.
[150:06.41]This is the other one.
[150:08.15]Hey, Peter.
[150:10.63]Peter.
[150:11.61]Better?
[150:13.71]Better?
[150:21.86]Better?
[150:24.22]This one does sound better.
[150:25.66]Alright, good, good, good.
[150:33.46]Yeah, anytime I listen to like a clip back or... Oh, what did I say on that stream?
[150:42.06]Oh, somebody clipped something and it's like, oh, the pong, pong, pong.
[150:46.37]Just like, oh, what the fuck, man?
[150:51.47]Dude, console camera distance max zoom factor 3.5 in chat and you can zoom out more.
[150:54.63]Oh, actually, let me... I think that's in here too, isn't it?
[151:00.15]Camera.
[151:01.87]Mac, there we go.
[151:03.13]Yeah.
[151:06.15]Hey, that's better.
[151:06.65]Okay, I can see way more.
[151:10.19]I don't mind being zoomed in, though.
[151:19.30]You think you're so smart?
[151:20.02]Spell World of Warcraft.
[151:22.40]W... Um... I don't... I don't... Fuck off.
[151:32.09]Uh... Get an invite, sure.
[151:42.22]I still need the ichor.
[151:56.95]You're a reptilian imitating human speech.
[151:59.25]I think that this is way too hard to do.
[152:03.41]Because I can't speak any other languages.
[152:05.61]Do you think I'd really know, like, reptilian?
[152:09.23]I failed every single course.
[152:11.84]I failed.
[152:12.50]I failed Spanish.
[152:13.34]I failed every language course I ever took.
[152:16.20]How come you're undead?
[152:19.68]I don't know.
[152:22.78]I like undeads.
[152:24.41]I like the humans.
[152:29.25]I like the humans.
[152:33.37]Fuck, I didn't get that.
[152:35.54]So many people here.
[152:40.61]I just fell in the grave.
[152:41.51]How do I get out of here?
[152:42.09]I was like, am I not stuck in there, am I?
[152:45.46]Uh-oh.
[153:00.91]It might be time to lair.
[153:03.13]We might have to get another group of people.
[153:05.47]Because I still need... How many of these do I need?
[153:12.35]lot right I need four more of these alright I'm gonna layer thanks playing maybe I'll see you guys again uh is there anyone is this a different layer oh maybe oh oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god I gotta get out of the way
[153:41.70]I could just spawn into a... Yeah, that's exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[153:45.32]Okay.
[153:46.34]That might have just killed me if I stood there.
[153:49.72]Because when you get layered, it just brings you to a different server, effectively.
[153:54.34]And that server could have ten of these and nobody's here.
[153:56.89]And five things are around me.
[154:01.07]Okay.
[154:01.93]I just got scared for a second, but we're good.
[154:08.67]Thank you for the layer.
[154:09.25]Appreciate it.
[154:16.11]this is more over here yeah don't layer onto mobs that's a good uh that's a good point I got a layer I'm good thank you though there we are okay two more of these and I'm good
[154:47.14]Do I have max level on the wand yet?
[154:53.16]There we go.
[154:53.44]Okay.
[154:53.80]Wand is maxed out.
[155:03.33]The more I watch this, the more I want to resub.
[155:06.05]Yeah.
[155:06.75]Hold on.
[155:07.05]By the way.
[155:08.96]I've been playing so just carelessly because there's been 15 people surrounding me.
[155:15.25]I could die.
[155:15.73]I gotta be very fucking careful.
[155:20.09]This game is no joke alone.
[155:21.73]It's not.
[155:22.17]Even with a pet.
[155:26.37]There we go.
[155:26.71]Okay, that's 8 out of 8.
[155:27.35]Now let's go.
[155:30.93]Gotta kill the... Wait, what's below me?
[155:35.58]Go up to this farm first.
[155:37.70]Yeah, we'll do this one.
[155:41.67]I've never played RuneScape.
[155:43.93]Do you lose anything if you die?
[155:45.27]Uh, yes.
[155:48.93]Your entire character and everything in your bank and everything in your inventory, everything in your backpack, everything on you, the character can no longer be played.
[155:59.14]The only way that you can play the character again if you die is I think you can server transfer somewhere else that's not a hardcore server.
[156:13.51]Alright, I got to pay attention here.
[156:21.14]I should attach that to immolate instead.
[156:23.36]That just scared the shit out of me.
[156:28.99]Spirit reduced by two.
[156:30.77]What the fuck?
[156:32.37]Yeah, we'll both do the same thing, I think.
[156:43.49]But no, I've never played RuneScape, although I know I would love it.
[156:46.03]I'll just invite this guy too.
[156:54.96]We're all doing the same thing.
[156:56.08]Might as well, right?
[156:58.24]Well, how about you?
[157:07.89]RuneScape is a great chill background game.
[157:11.51]I know I would love it and I really um I only got time for one uh video game MMO relationship it's it's a I've already got this one here okay we got this is where the boss is right yeah alright so yeah there's I think he spawns over here yeah
[157:38.04]maggot eye alright level 10 on okay level 10. the this could stomp us alright you ready this thing is four levels higher than me we're fine alright let's get it he's I can't even hit this guy
[158:07.96]Yeah, we're fine.
[158:08.96]This is nothing.
[158:09.56]We got it.
[158:12.79]There it is.
[158:13.31]Cool.
[158:14.73]Are you still gaming naked?
[158:20.07]Do I have to answer that question?
[158:22.30]You should already know the answer.
[158:29.04]I got everything here.
[158:36.74]Okay, next is this new plague, Darkhound Blood.
[158:41.05]I don't know if any of these people are on it, but that's where I'm going.
[158:50.59]Hold on, I need to drink my coffee.
[158:56.26]Oh shit, are you alright?
[158:59.83]the hardcore has so much anxiety with it because somebody might run in front of you and be have like two or three mobs just trained on them and you have to make a decision on oh my god you have four things on you you're almost dead if I help you I die too you have to make that decision whether you're gonna I'm gonna go in or I'm gonna go out
[159:28.68]Alright, let's go this way.
[159:34.01]What's with all the new chatters?
[159:35.75]I'm imagining I'm in the World of Warcraft category.
[159:40.57]And I died from fall damage.
[159:43.19]Oh, that sucks.
[159:45.38]That sucks so bad.
[159:46.52]I don't think I've been in the WoW category in like 10 years.
[159:51.96]I think they're this way.
[160:07.91]And World of Warcraft is currently very in right now, so I imagine a lot of people probably just jumping around to different streams.
[160:15.43]If you are welcome, how are you?
[160:17.15]Good to see you.
[160:17.63]I think they like the dogs, right?
[160:27.76]These things.
[160:28.72]Level 8 though.
[160:30.55]It's at level 9.
[160:31.39]This is scary.
[160:35.37]Why is it in right now?
[160:38.29]The Only Fangs Guild.
[160:43.19]They're currently raiding.
[160:44.01]Are they raiding right now?
[160:45.88]They might be raiding right now.
[160:50.10]Soda Poppin, Mizkif, a lot of the OTK group, and then obviously Tyler1 was a big part of it.
[160:58.88]It's been a huge deal.
[160:59.64]A lot of streamers have been doing it.
[161:00.92]I think there's like a thousand people in the guild that are all streamers.
[161:06.69]It's been a, it's actually, no, it's been a really cool way to discover other streamers.
[161:13.13]There's lots of people that I just, that probably wouldn't have gone searching for that I was like, oh, wait, you're doing this.
[161:18.34]That's cool.
[161:20.26]And you're like, oh, what are you, what's your deal?
[161:32.63]I started watching a lot of Grubby, actually.
[161:38.75]uh, mainly specifically from this only thing.
[161:41.87]So a lot of cool.
[161:48.57]Oh, watch out for this troll here.
[161:50.05]Wow.
[161:54.60]It's been like the number eight or nine game for ages.
[161:57.56]Finally getting prime time.
[161:58.96]I cannot attack this.
[162:10.33]Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[162:15.20]What about Warcraft 3?
[162:16.54]Warcraft 3 is fun.
[162:18.26]The only problem with Warcraft 3 is... Every time I try to play the actual regular Warcraft 3... I just... I get so frustrated at the early game.
[162:31.80]I don't know why.
[162:32.48]It's just, it's that, it's the building the, doing the gold mines and making the second town to make the other gold mines.
[162:39.44]I just, I just, I, I love the idea of Warcraft 3.
[162:45.80]I played a shitload of Warcraft 3 and Warcraft 2 when I was younger.
[162:48.92]A lot of custom games, but I'm just so bad.
[162:52.44]And it just scratches a bad, like a place in my brain that I don't, it's like, oh, I can't, I hate it.
[163:06.24]Grubby's teaching, Tyler1, uh, yeah.
[163:10.50]Finally, jeez, there's one.
[163:16.22]And something about RTSs, that is like the best place to embarrass yourself.
[163:21.72]Of all games you could play, I don't, uh, chess might be in the same category.
[163:27.48]Like you don't play chess unless you like kind of know how to play chess.
[163:31.36]Otherwise, you're just gonna look kind of like a fucking asshole.
[163:38.72]And you can make yourself look like a total fucking idiot when you play RTSs.
[163:43.32]The actions per minute and you're going too slow and how do I do this?
[163:47.10]Oh my god, I did that in the wrong order.
[163:48.70]I have- I just built this building and I didn't do any of the- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[163:52.57]Careful, careful.
[163:52.99]These things are like level 10.
[163:56.03]I'm so dead.
[163:57.45]Oh my god, I am dead.
[164:00.87]Alright, don't panic.
[164:01.45]This is the first real problem.
[164:02.67]There's like 10 people here.
[164:06.32]Oh, my pet is still attacking it.
[164:07.80]Get over here.
[164:11.94]Oh my God.
[164:13.18]It's still here.
[164:13.90]It's still chasing me.
[164:17.20]Oh my God.
[164:17.56]I'm going to... Oh my God.
[164:18.24]We have to... Okay.
[164:19.72]Calm down.
[164:20.04]Calm down.
[164:20.34]Calm down.
[164:20.92]Calm down.
[164:21.46]Calm down.
[164:21.88]Calm down.
[164:22.36]Calm down.
[164:23.04]Calm down.
[164:23.64]Help.
[164:24.56]Help me.
[164:31.50]Alright.
[164:31.72]We're good.
[164:31.98]We're good.
[164:32.20]We're good.
[164:32.42]Don't fucking... What is it?
[164:34.08]Who's casting?
[164:37.22]Kill that fucking thing.
[164:40.40]Oh, we got a level 18 here.
[164:41.66]Okay, we're fine.
[164:48.70]How is this thing still alive?
[164:50.02]Alright, we're fine.
[164:52.02]Everyone's good.
[164:52.78]Nobody died.
[164:53.60]Everything's... We just... I just aggroed everything.
[164:57.03]I just turned around and... You don't do that in hardcore.
[165:00.93]Okay, I'm forgetting the very basic concept of playing this game in hardcore.
[165:05.23]Don't just run in a straight line to anything.
[165:10.88]And you have to be so aware of your surroundings.
[165:22.82]Okay, we're good.
[165:25.70]You gotta lock in?
[165:26.42]I know.
[165:27.88]When was the last time you saw somebody have a, I almost died at level six?
[165:45.55]Oh, my pet is dead.
[165:46.77]Shit.
[165:47.43]Well, at least he tanked the damage.
[165:53.17]That's a good YouTube title.
[165:55.08]When was the last time you saw somebody die at level six?
[165:58.04]That is a good one.
[166:08.09]Okay.
[166:19.72]and that should do it I don't know if anybody else who knows if anybody needs these right now okay here's the deal uh we're gonna swoop back here hit the town up complete the three quests that we just did sell some hit over here do the putrid thing maybe get this it's a little high but it's alright and let's go bro has actual bodyguards
[166:48.84]Yeah, after level 10, I feel like this is... That'll probably even out a little.
[167:03.72]VIP Andy.
[167:07.75]Like, what a way to play World of Warcraft.
[167:10.64]I feel like this is how, like, a billionaire would play World of Warcraft, right?
[167:14.74]Well, no, I'm not gonna die.
[167:17.36]How many fucking random... How many random, like, fucking slaves can I have?
[167:24.01]And where's all my money?
[167:29.91]And everybody cheers whenever I do anything, right?
[167:33.36]Like...
[167:36.75]Oh, wow, dude, you killed that guy.
[167:38.31]Fucking nice, dude.
[167:39.69]Hell yeah, man.
[167:40.69]High fives.
[167:41.57]Thank you.
[167:42.53]Thank you.
[167:52.66]But in my opinion, the sense of accomplishment for a WoW hardcore is after level.
[167:58.08]That's when you get out of level 10.
[168:02.34]Right?
[168:02.76]We all know this.
[168:03.90]The game, the World of Warcraft classic experience, hardcore, is really the 10 to 60.
[168:11.92]Maybe even 15 to 60.
[168:12.88]Okay, just head back to the room.
[168:26.59]There would be a prepaid audience here too.
[168:28.72]It's true.
[168:34.64]10 to 20 is probably the most dangerous part.
[168:37.24]It is pretty dangerous because you don't really have a whole lot of your total kit.
[168:49.53]And once you get it at like what 30 or 40 is usually when you have like all your abilities pretty much.
[168:58.57]How long has this stream been going for?
[169:01.35]Level seven in three hours.
[169:03.37]That's a, that's a level an hour.
[169:05.03]Fuck.
[169:05.65]That's terrible.
[169:08.85]That's awful.
[169:12.27]I said I was going to get to 10 in an hour.
[169:17.12]That's like, that's not good.
[169:19.98]I'm sorry.
[169:20.38]I'm going to be seven though.
[169:23.40]You can't stop till you hit 60.
[169:24.72]Oh God.
[169:30.89]Well, okay, hold on.
[169:33.27]We did... I did sit around and hang out.
[169:37.19]And for the first, like, 30-40 minutes of making the character... Yeah, I have a hallway.
[169:41.37]That's not accurate.
[169:42.23]It's been about an hour and a half.
[169:50.86]Jerm, are you a level 6?
[169:51.78]The one title is wrong?
[169:53.86]What do you mean?
[169:54.60]I don't even know what the title is.
[170:00.37]Ooh, that's a lot of money.
[170:07.55]There we go.
[170:09.68]I'm going to go to the undercity.
[170:14.24]I got a full inventory.
[170:19.84]Oh, it's the group is taking a lot of XP from you.
[170:27.53]That's not right.
[170:30.72]What would you ask of death?
[170:35.90]Sells for more, probably.
[170:36.90]Damn, that was a lot of experience.
[170:38.83]That was a thousand experience, almost.
[170:40.21]The hell?
[170:46.55]Oh.
[170:53.88]Where's this other person?
[170:58.16]In the house, I think.
[171:00.50]Did you take Leon Kennedy in a fight?
[171:05.17]Leon Kennedy is a trained military and law enforcement officer.
[171:12.81]I, um, I'm sitting in a lazy boy.
[171:16.65]I'm five, seven and a half on a good day.
[171:20.03]I weigh like 150 pounds, 148 pounds or something, 145 pounds.
[171:24.89]Um, I've, and, uh, and the sight of blood scares me.
[171:29.39]So, I don't know if I would be able to do that.
[171:33.45]Trust no one.
[171:33.75]Victory is upon us.
[171:46.86]Level 7, can't get new abilities yet.
[171:49.68]But you can dodge all the attacks.
[171:54.55]Yeah.
[171:59.77]Oh, does somebody have a... You got a pet, right?
[172:02.87]This thing eats meat?
[172:04.03]Here.
[172:06.09]Yeah, you have to feed your pet.
[172:07.19]Whose pet is this?
[172:08.87]Whislungus.
[172:15.26]Oh, here you go.
[172:17.71]There is a beat.
[172:27.50]Challenge you to a duel.
[172:28.48]Nope.
[172:31.45]I'm going to keep the cloth.
[172:36.39]Because I need to do first aid.
[172:38.19]Is there a first aid trader here?
[172:39.90]Probably.
[172:52.08]This is two health every five seconds for an hour.
[172:55.34]That's pretty good.
[172:57.28]In the inn there is.
[173:00.15]Because that's one profession that I absolutely need to make sure is up.
[173:12.23]How is Mr. Toad doing?
[173:14.55]He is sleeping right next to me.
[173:22.54]More duskbat pelts.
[173:23.56]I already did that.
[173:24.10]Yeah, that's why sometimes you might even hear him.
[173:36.43]You might hear him sneeze or go like sometimes.
[173:41.35]Because he thinks right now.
[173:42.65]I think sometimes he thinks I'm talking to him.
[173:47.46]So he kind of looks at me.
[173:48.42]He's just like, what?
[173:49.62]Like, what?
[173:50.46]What do you what do you want?
[173:51.72]Like, what is it?
[173:52.92]It's like, no, I'm not talking to you.
[173:54.24]I you're such a cute little dog.
[173:57.34]But I think he thinks I'm talking to him.
[173:58.72]So sometimes I'd be like, I'm listening.
[174:00.07]Like, what do you want me to do?
[174:01.03]Okay.
[174:03.89]First aid trainer.
[174:15.25]I do have the ability to track it.
[174:19.95]Where are you?
[174:22.03]No, like right behind me.
[174:25.37]Yeah, they are.
[174:28.49]One silver for this.
[174:29.49]That's fine.
[174:33.69]I need to put that on the bar.
[174:34.93]Yeah, so I got to get this up.
[174:44.53]How am I doing?
[174:45.01]I'm doing good.
[174:45.55]I'm doing well.
[174:54.47]And these have to come up here.
[174:55.41]Because this will save your life.
[174:58.30]66 damage healed over 6 seconds.
[175:00.30]You can't get hurt if you're in combat.
[175:02.32]You have to be careful.
[175:02.90]Because if you take damage, it stops.
[175:05.02]So you technically can't be hit while you do it.
[175:06.90]But it can save your ass.
[175:22.53]What are we doing?
[175:23.03]A dance party?
[175:24.95]Should I do the YouTuber video and intro?
[175:28.57]I'm going to get this out of the way because I'm not doing this again.
[175:31.88]We're not doing this ever again.
[175:33.10]I'm going to play WoW.
[175:34.84]Let's get the YouTuber intro out of the way.
[175:40.22]Everybody upstairs.
[175:45.99]And everybody into this room here.
[175:55.83]Everybody kind of get in a line.
[175:57.01]And let's get it started.
[176:04.13]Hold on.
[176:04.61]I'll tell you, I will wait for everybody to get here.
[176:17.64]And let's do this one.
[176:18.70]That sounds good to me.
[176:19.58]Alright.
[176:19.84]So everybody dance.
[176:21.13]Everybody slash dance.
[176:22.07]We're going to do the YouTuber intro.
[176:24.37]And I don't want to hear it ever again after this.
[176:27.89]Don't ask to do any of this.
[176:29.52]We're just getting this stupid shit out of the way first.
[176:31.48]Okay.
[176:35.44]Dance and nobody talk.
[176:52.29]Hey, what's going on?
[176:53.27]Welcome everybody to World of Warcraft.
[176:55.91]It's me, Jerma, here with a new series that I'm starting.
[176:59.51]And what the heck?
[177:01.17]Everybody's in here dancing.
[177:02.11]What are you doing?
[177:02.69]Hey, somebody's jumping on the bed.
[177:04.70]Get off that.
[177:06.06]Hey, how many people jumping on the bed?
[177:08.56]Get off the bed, right?
[177:09.52]Okay.
[177:10.90]So World of Warcraft Hardcore is what we're doing.
[177:14.42]Hopefully I don't have to worry about all these people.
[177:17.75]I'm playing as a undead warlock.
[177:21.73]And a warlock is a evil caster.
[177:25.73]He's kind of like, like a ghost or something.
[177:31.91]Anyways, this is going to be probably a long series.
[177:33.75]I'm imagining this will be probably at least probably the next six to 12 months of five videos a day.
[177:43.78]So I hope you like World of Warcraft because if not, you're going to have to fucking leave.
[177:51.95]Because that's all I'm doing for the next year.
[177:58.13]Okay, that's a good place to cut it.
[178:01.07]I'll probably cut it a little bit before that.
[178:04.17]Thank you.
[178:05.87]No, leave me the fuck alone.
[178:09.20]I only do, like, the community shit on camera.
[178:11.80]So, like, get the fuck out of here.
[178:13.30]All of you.
[178:17.76]And by the way, if you ever tell people that, like, I was mean here, like, who the fuck's gonna believe you?
[178:23.28]fuck out of here now let me get the let me get the damage on it because I need to get to level 10 so I can do a time skip because I'm not fucking playing this game for like the next year I just said that to make sure people fucking paid me
[178:52.97]Being fake comes so naturally to you.
[179:05.27]Now.
[179:09.76]Trade me for bandages.
[179:10.88]I'm not taking any free stuff.
[179:13.14]That's 80 experience.
[179:14.38]No shit, I haven't been leveling up.
[179:15.70]I've been getting like 20 experience this whole time.
[179:28.67]That's why I'm level seven.
[179:33.81]I've been splitting the EXP with the whole class.
[179:44.05]Dude's getting carried, but he draws the line at bandages.
[179:50.61]Yeah, but what am I... Okay, what am I... Do you want me just to not play the game?
[179:55.34]Why don't I just slash follow somebody and like eat ice cream out of the fucking pint?
[180:00.48]And just group with everybody and just have people pick up stuff for me and give it to me at the end.
[180:04.33]Okay, I gotta do... Oh, I still gotta get the weed.
[180:23.55]The YouTuber.
[180:27.28]It's kind of funny.
[180:28.80]I kind of feel like a Pokémon.
[180:32.87]Because I think all YouTubers have... I did that.
[180:36.33]I did that.
[180:38.19]I lived that life.
[180:41.98]Oh, God.
[180:42.26]I almost accepted that.
[180:58.72]I just have to kill these?
[180:59.64]No, they drop claws.
[181:15.13]You can auto-decline duels in the options?
[181:16.97]Ah, okay.
[181:18.95]Hey, I need that.
[181:27.72]ragefire chasm I think no fucking inventory who was the person with that cat whatever uh I think uh ragefire chasm is gonna have that's like little 15 isn't it that's kind of a long way to go
[182:01.59]Looking for any two more of those weeds.
[182:04.82]You could do it at 13.
[182:06.76]Yeah, you could do it at 13.
[182:09.42]But you can also die at 13.
[182:15.19]Philosophically.
[182:17.29]I want to make sure I'm at least level.
[182:21.53]At least level 15 or 14.
[182:25.40]I ain't gonna pull aggro at level 12 and die in one hit.
[182:37.32]Come on, dude.
[182:37.98]Okay, I got two.
[182:45.02]What kind of cocktails do you like?
[182:51.04]I like vodka pineapple.
[182:53.88]Vodka cranberry.
[182:57.84]I like a nice scotch.
[183:01.87]And I promise I'm not, I'm not trying to be like a Redditor when I say that.
[183:04.85]I, I, I like a Two Fingers of like a nice whiskey.
[183:07.87]Just neat.
[183:24.20]Scotch whiskey, Two Fingers, neat, please.
[183:26.42]That's how, that's how I'll take it.
[183:29.64]Where are these enemies?
[183:39.19]Hey, hey, um, hey, hey.
[183:43.40]Stop fucking attacking stuff before I do!
[183:48.04]This is the only way I can communicate correctly to everybody here.
[183:55.58]Hey guys!
[183:56.66]Just want a quick little reminder for everybody that it's gonna be a part of the video.
[184:00.13]I need to get aggro, I need to get damage done 30% of it first before everybody else.
[184:07.04]Otherwise, I won't be able to get those, slay those dragons.
[184:11.15]You know what I mean?
[184:13.75]So please let me make sure I get 30% damage first.
[184:18.01]Okay.
[184:18.93]Everybody, you're all amazing.
[184:20.64]Everybody fucking get it?
[184:38.33]That's the layer.
[184:40.51]What?
[184:40.73]Actually, no.
[184:41.29]Oh, okay.
[184:41.73]I think he just got aggro.
[184:42.73]Okay.
[184:47.57]You need to give away a Razer DeathAdder.
[184:49.64]Oh, no.
[184:50.02]What about the Elden Ring Battle Royale thing?
[185:03.75]I'm not going to take the layer yet because I'm kind of terrified to be out here in the open.
[185:09.40]But I do appreciate it.
[185:11.04]Give me one more minute.
[185:11.88]As long as I get the wand on it, I should be fine.
[185:26.61]Ooh.
[185:27.69]Is that better than what I have on?
[185:28.95]No.
[185:31.07]I can't eat these yet.
[185:34.24]Why do I have this old pair of shoes?
[185:36.80]Oh shit, drink this!
[185:38.63]I haven't had that on, what an idiot.
[185:51.15]I'm not skilled enough to eat a fish yet, no, unfortunately.
[186:01.16]Okay.
[186:02.34]Well, I don't know what that was.
[186:03.26]I thought someone just threw a rock at me.
[186:04.69]Alright.
[186:09.35]I'm going to layer.
[186:09.85]Thank you, everybody.
[186:12.09]Layering.
[186:14.41]I need more of these enemies available.
[186:18.27]Seems like we killed everything.
[186:31.50]No corruption.
[186:32.18]No, I'm not doing it.
[186:33.64]Nobody even asked that.
[186:42.74]Oh, shit.
[186:45.90]Can you put it on free-for-all loot?
[187:02.95]You're so greedy you want all the loot.
[187:05.07]Unless you're on this quest too then.
[187:13.56]He's inviting everybody.
[187:23.35]Just bringing them all into this.
[187:26.09]That's so funny.
[187:28.41]It's okay.
[187:28.85]We don't want any trouble.
[187:41.16]This quest is going to take you an hour.
[187:42.50]I think I'll be alright.
[187:44.40]As long as I can get the drop.
[187:48.28]There we go.
[187:48.54]I already got three.
[187:49.00]I'm good.
[187:53.77]Why did he attack this?
[187:54.59]I didn't tell him to do that.
[187:55.91]Oh, you're losing XP again.
[188:07.10]Oh, fuck.
[188:07.72]Alright, I got to drop group.
[188:23.06]What about TrickShot Simulator?
[188:25.42]That's so much more.
[188:26.36]That's quadruple what I was getting.
[188:28.50]Okay, I gotta stay out of group.
[188:45.47]Oh, that's herbalism.
[188:46.17]Alright, I know everyone's gonna say engineering, engineering, engineering, engineering, but...
[188:56.30]I mean, tailoring seems like it'd be kind of fun.
[189:14.24]Thanks.
[189:14.58]Alright, that's done.
[189:17.46]Still need some putrid claws.
[189:32.86]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[189:34.46]Get away from me.
[189:35.78]Mine.
[189:37.54]What is this?
[189:39.42]Blacksmithing teaches you how to make copper chain vest.
[189:42.48]108 armor plus 1 strength.
[189:45.49]Does anybody need that?
[189:47.05]Does anybody want that?
[189:58.86]Because I'm willing to sell it for you.
[190:00.72]Like, I'm willing to sell it to you.
[190:10.00]Aggro.
[190:10.54]Aggro.
[190:10.83]Who pulled?
[190:22.56]Epic super loot.
[190:23.44]I could probably sell that in the auction house for like fucking 50 silver.
[190:31.98]What can I get for that?
[190:32.68]10 silver or something?
[190:34.12]That's double my current net worth.
[190:36.11]I mean, that's not counting the property that I own in the undercity.
[190:53.97]Vendor value.
[191:11.67]go make some more of these hey what are your thoughts on Ben Franklin um I don't know dude I don't know man whatever
[191:45.61]How many more do I need?
[191:46.25]I still need these as well.
[191:58.94]Well, might as well do it.
[192:04.04]Can you do a whatever stream?
[192:08.26]I'm not taking requests right now.
[192:12.75]I'm currently locking the heck in.
[192:17.91]Whatever, I don't need it anyways.
[192:34.26]Let me cast corruption for all the fucking whiners.
[192:46.61]I can't pick up any of this stuff.
[192:58.99]You should play Balatro in the corner.
[193:07.72]I can barely pay attention to what's on the screen, let alone a second screen with something else on it.
[193:11.38]And I already have that.
[193:12.22]It's you.
[193:15.12]You're over on a different screen.
[193:21.81]Okay, if you're just walking by...
[193:48.29]If you're walking by and... Hey, hey, Chris, want a group so I can shield?
[193:52.40]It's like, well, that's a... I don't know if these are like... Ooh!
[193:55.56]These are like friends or something, like a family member or something.
[194:00.58]Just typing in slash say, like, hey, Chris, hey, that's like my real name.
[194:13.29]Chat is a single-celled organism with one neuron.
[194:15.93]Ha ha ha!
[194:23.43]Single cell organism.
[194:26.78]You're not even going to give him the benefit of having at least like a cell wall.
[194:33.14]Come on.
[194:40.39]Where are all the bat wings?
[194:56.30]Where are the Jermamites?
[194:57.70]Single cell organisms do have cell walls if they're plants.
[195:00.66]Oh, shit.
[195:08.65]Should I layer again?
[195:09.47]Because I feel like I'm only seeing like two bats.
[195:17.81]That's so annoying too.
[195:19.21]Like, hey, I got to jump around to different layers and take your mobs.
[195:37.63]Wait.
[195:39.69]Hold on a second.
[195:40.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:41.19]What's my... Oh, Duskbat Pelt.
[195:44.67]Okay, I was like, have I not been picking it up the whole time because of my inventory?
[195:51.24]Oh, fuck.
[195:52.26]Uh-oh.
[195:52.62]Big mistake.
[195:54.34]That's a big mistake, actually, because I don't know what I'm going to spawn in with.
[195:57.60]Oh, God.
[195:57.90]What did I do?
[195:58.30]Uh-oh.
[196:08.96]I think I'm alright.
[196:13.52]Is this the same layer?
[196:14.18]I think this is the same layer.
[196:24.33]Oh shit, same layer.
[196:25.17]Thank you.
[196:47.82]Alright, let's move.
[196:51.70]How long are you going to stream, by the way, on this?
[196:53.72]Oh, same layer.
[196:54.48]Fuck.
[196:55.96]Appreciate it, though.
[197:00.90]Oh, there's a couple spawned over here.
[197:03.12]Okay, I got a couple respawns.
[197:07.09]Yeah, there's respawns here.
[197:24.12]I need one more.
[197:24.56]Oh my god, that hurt.
[197:31.86]Really?
[197:33.01]I need one!
[197:49.47]You're not level one anymore?
[197:51.43]There we go.
[197:51.83]Okay, that's done.
[197:54.52]Just need a few more claws and we can keep moving.
[197:56.64]Does it say level one?
[197:59.00]That's fine.
[198:02.92]It's like watching my uncle play WoW.
[198:08.84]That's fine.
[198:11.50]Just wait till I'm...
[198:13.95]Out of a 40 man raid, just wait till I parse in the bottom, probably 25 percentile, but I'm going to be safe and I'll live.
[198:30.42]No.
[198:31.14]Hey, wait, hey, the like, be careful.
[198:32.98]Don't pull aggro.
[198:33.74]Oh, I am not.
[198:34.48]I am not pulling aggro.
[198:37.26]Don't worry about that.
[198:39.52]I'm gonna wait until... I'm gonna wait until, like, a full minute has gone by before I attack once.
[198:50.67]And I'm only gonna attack on my terms, when I feel like it.
[198:54.05]No one's gonna tell me to do that.
[198:57.09]If I want to cast a Shadow Bolt and then not cast another Shadow Bolt for a few minutes, that's for me to decide, not you.
[199:02.44]Or anybody else.
[199:19.54]The only thing you're pulling is your back.
[199:25.10]Hey, whatever.
[199:25.54]Hey, this back is seen.
[199:28.62]Many, many... Yeah, I've had many experiences, okay?
[199:32.40]I've been able to... I've lifted weights.
[199:35.18]I've climbed a mountain before.
[199:45.68]One more.
[199:51.28]Splash Mountain?
[199:53.40]Yeah, and you know how scary that ride is?
[199:55.82]What the fuck?
[199:56.92]Oh, I thought that was a bad- I thought that was- You scared the absolute shit out of me.
[200:00.82]I thought that was a lead or something yelling, Oh, vile interlopers!
[200:06.39]I was like, what the fuck did I just aggro?
[200:11.67]Red text bright on the screen.
[200:16.73]Alright, let's turn this in.
[200:28.00]Is 2012 buff Jerma coming back?
[200:32.29]No.
[200:41.24]Son of Argil?
[200:42.94]Oh, don't worry.
[200:43.44]I'll sacrifice everybody to get away from that.
[200:45.72]If there's going to be like 10 people around me, there's no way.
[200:48.64]I'm going to make sure I get out of there.
[200:52.52]I don't got that add-on either.
[200:53.70]I don't got, like, the, hey, look, a fucking elite.
[200:56.40]No, I'm just gonna have to rely on some of my, like, fucking meat shields.
[201:18.96]Here we go, okay.
[201:22.84]I have an offering.
[201:25.90]Ribs, ooh.
[201:28.32]13 armor, legs.
[201:38.64]Is it true that your mother was a murloc?
[201:40.22]Ban that person for an hour.
[201:43.60]Not gonna talk about my mother like that.
[201:45.80]No one talks about, you're not gonna talk about my mother like that.
[201:50.77]Ban for an hour.
[202:00.54]Oh, mama's boy.
[202:01.34]You know what?
[202:02.66]Ban that person too.
[202:03.26]You're not going to make a reference to somebody that made a reference making fun of my mother and make a reference making light of that.
[202:08.32]Ban that person for an hour too.
[202:16.44]Be quick about your business.
[202:21.83]25 copper, that's it?
[202:24.23]This is green.
[202:25.33]It's not even at least one silver?
[202:27.25]What a piece of shit.
[202:29.41]Oh, very important.
[202:30.75]Still save your life.
[202:36.14]But as a weird completionist, doesn't anybody kind of want this?
[202:47.82]Watch your back.
[202:52.21]I'm going to get up and stretch.
[202:53.11]And we'll continue.
[202:58.83]Should I get another coffee?
[203:02.23]Maybe I should.
[203:02.69]Do your mother ever watch your streams?
[203:10.23]I think she, yeah, she does.
[203:11.07]She tells me that she pops in sometimes.
[203:14.05]Very, like, randomly, rarely.
[203:15.19]She'll just be like, oh, I want to see what you're up to.
[203:25.18]When you get into Silverpine, all the followers are going to start to die.
[203:28.13]Yeah.
[203:31.65]We're making all kinds of... We're just messing around and... Oh, yeah.
[203:34.75]Everyone's here.
[203:35.39]We're all running around.
[203:36.27]Look at how easy this is.
[203:38.47]And some people are going to start dropping like flies.
[203:40.12]She's a member of the Dru crew.
[203:49.90]She's actually a member of the Sorcery Council.
[203:54.14]My mother is a member of the Sorcery Council.
[203:56.10]That's what she told me.
[203:58.93]I don't want to get rid of this stuff, but do I really care about Malachite?
[204:03.91]No.
[204:04.03]Alright, I'll be right back.
[204:08.03]I'm gonna get some more water.
[204:10.25]Might get another coffee.
[204:13.40]And I'll see you in a little bit.
[204:26.65]And ads are going to start playing as well.
[204:28.19]I know I want to make sure I say that before because some people don't have me in the tab, right?
[204:31.70]See you in a minute.
[208:27.65]welcome back how are you before I got up somebody said why are you peeing every 30 minutes I'm not I kind of just like to get up and move around seems like that three minutes is three four it's perfect to just move around even just blink my eyes a few times stand up because years ago
[208:58.00]The... I mean, I would fall into some really, really bad habits.
[209:04.94]And I'm trying to, if I'm going to stream, if I'm going to stream when I feel like it, right?
[209:10.15]I want to break those bad habits of sitting down for too long.
[209:13.91]Because it's not good for you.
[209:17.03]Need to use Mixer?
[209:29.74]If it's loud, we won't.
[209:30.66]What do you mean?
[209:34.30]Sitting takes a lot of years off your life.
[209:40.79]And I'm telling you, it did.
[209:49.17]I... Sometimes I would get up and... Sometimes I would take one break.
[209:57.05]In eight hours, and I wouldn't even realize I was doing it.
[210:00.87]You just get so locked in, you're just so, I wanna do this, I wanna do this, I got this today, I wanna do this.
[210:05.33]Four or five hours goes by and you haven't even stood up.
[210:11.21]So doing these ad breaks is like a way, like I've said a few times before, it's just a way to force me to get up.
[210:22.70]And maybe I'll make some money.
[210:25.08]Fuck yeah!
[210:31.20]Man discovers working at a job.
[210:36.80]Yeah, I just feel like I... You just get so locked in sometimes.
[210:40.26]Like five hours goes by and you haven't even... All you've done is like just sat and looked.
[210:46.04]I also have ADHD too, so it's even worse.
[210:49.87]I have to like, I have to get up and move.
[210:57.55]Is an eight hour shift with one break normal?
[211:01.23]Um, I, I have not worked in the corporate or retail world in a very long time.
[211:08.48]It's, uh, what, do you get like an hour for lunch?
[211:10.82]Like 30 minutes, 40 minutes, usually?
[211:15.36]Which I, that, fuck that, by the way, that should be longer.
[211:20.14]If you're lucky.
[211:21.90]15 minutes?
[211:23.39]What?
[211:26.71]30 minutes for lunch?
[211:27.39]What the fuck is this world coming to?
[211:32.13]You can't eat lunch in 30 minutes.
[211:35.50]It takes me like 10 minutes to prepare even what I even want to eat in the first place.
[211:42.34]You know what I would want to see in the world?
[211:45.53]I would love to see a siesta.
[211:47.23]In the middle of the day, an hour or two.
[211:51.07]Don't do anything.
[211:52.03]Go take a nap.
[211:52.91]Go fucking play WoW or something for like an hour.
[211:57.77]If I could wave the magic wand and just like change the entire world, a siesta would be in every single country on Earth.
[212:11.45]That's not enough time to do anything.
[212:22.66]That's your first order of business, not like, not like world peace.
[212:28.24]Okay, guys, at my first order of business, there's a lot of fucking crazy, horrible things going on, but I want a siesta.
[212:35.67]I want to drink wine for 40 minutes each day.
[212:39.81]Well, that wouldn't be my first order of business.
[212:42.28]It'd be, like, after a few weeks.
[212:46.92]That's a good start.
[212:51.46]Wine for 40 minutes each day would be world peace.
[212:55.32]Yeah.
[212:56.56]Yeah.
[212:57.96]What do we got?
[212:58.64]Oh boy, oh boy.
[212:59.80]I don't even want to look at it.
[213:04.32]Alright, you ever go- okay.
[213:06.20]You ever go to your mailbox, like your real mailbox, like at the mail, and it's been a while, and you just see that fucking stuffed mailbox, and you're like, God, I don't even want to fucking go through all this.
[213:23.44]Doesn't happen that frequently, but when it does, it's just like, oh, what even is all this shit?
[213:29.52]I don't know what all this even fucking is.
[213:31.33]Okay, so I'm good or anything.
[213:35.65]I got to turn this in.
[213:38.03]And oh, I think we're going to get our Voidwalker quest.
[213:43.96]I check it daily.
[213:49.65]I just don't remember to check it every day.
[213:52.01]There's always something in The Sims.
[213:54.55]Oh wait, Doomweed.
[213:55.97]Well, I'll complete this stuff first.
[213:58.03]There's always something else in The Sims queue in my brain that's just in front of get the mail.
[214:08.96]Please play this more.
[214:09.86]I love this stream.
[214:17.64]Can you do a yoga stream?
[214:19.06]No.
[214:21.96]Why?
[214:22.20]So a third of the people here can screen cap every minute?
[214:31.01]Yeah, I know that there'd be a bunch of screen cappers.
[214:37.00]Yeah, no fucking thank you.
[214:42.87]Oh, wait, hold on.
[214:43.97]This angle right here.
[214:44.71]Oh my god, wait, wait, zoom in.
[214:46.23]Yep, I think his ass is right there.
[214:47.93]Yep, zoom in really close.
[214:50.20]No, we're not doing that.
[214:51.66]Yeah, if I do a yoga stream, guys, I'm going to be in a fucking scuba suit.
[215:04.36]Oh, I got to turn this in again.
[215:06.44]I got to run back here.
[215:07.78]Oh, level eight.
[215:15.37]Is having a Sims Q in your brain an ADHD thing?
[215:18.07]I do the exact same thing, but ADHD things keep getting added in random places.
[215:22.79]I honestly don't even know what the hell, like, proper attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is nowadays.
[215:29.16]I got diagnosed with ADHD almost 20 plus years ago.
[215:35.98]It's been a very long time.
[215:36.98]I don't even know what the criteria is anymore.
[215:39.71]Who knows?
[215:52.52]But it was 80.
[215:53.06]Yeah, that's the thing that's so weird because you can... You can have ADD or ADHD or you could have both.
[216:00.33]Or ADHD is ADD, but it's an extra H. Like, okay, whatever.
[216:05.54]But yeah, where is this in?
[216:13.78]Where is this?
[216:14.40]Outside?
[216:20.47]HD DVD.
[216:21.67]Yeah.
[216:22.13]HD DVD HD.
[216:23.26]There's a ton of people to have it.
[216:29.56]It's like one in nine people nowadays.
[216:31.60]I don't know.
[216:34.38]That's crazy.
[216:46.05]It's lower than one in nine.
[216:47.41]Is it really?
[216:48.99]No way.
[216:50.69]No, I had no way.
[216:54.21]All because of phones and fast content and shit.
[216:57.43]Oh my God, that's actually true.
[216:58.77]Actually, that is kind of true.
[217:05.16]Yeah.
[217:08.08]Yeah, I'm a huge proponent.
[217:09.20]Like, guys, listen, like, seriously, like, I'm not going to go off on a rant about, oh, technology, don't fucking use it.
[217:14.78]I'm so much better than everybody because I don't use social media.
[217:18.31]Hey, kids, the phone is your enemy.
[217:22.13]But, man, just, like, have a healthy relationship with it.
[217:24.83]That's also fucked up.
[217:26.73]Let's go up this way.
[217:36.30]You can, you can use social media and then just, and put it away for a bit.
[217:40.32]I, I, I haven't, I don't use Twitter or whatever, X, whatever the fuck it is.
[217:45.30]Don't really use Discord, really.
[217:50.17]But just make, just have a good relationship with it.
[217:52.59]It's easy to connect with people.
[217:53.93]It's so much, oh my God, that person, it's so much easier if I can just DM them.
[217:59.48]But you know, here's a hot take for you.
[218:02.94]I kind of like when people can't fucking reach you.
[218:06.10]I kind of liked it back when people had to call the fucking phone and it was like... And you could all look at each other on the couch and be like, nope, don't give a fuck.
[218:16.03]I'm, nope.
[218:17.21]That's going to the machine maybe, and I don't know, maybe I'll answer it.
[218:21.51]I think we're so accessible now.
[218:23.54]Everybody's just so accessible.
[218:31.05]Like, sometimes you just don't want to be able to be contacted.
[218:35.84]And, you know, especially with stuff like, you know, like read receipts and stuff, people can send you a message and it's like, oh, what?
[218:41.20]He saw that.
[218:43.13]Which I don't understand why anybody would, why that would ever be on.
[218:46.45]Like, I don't know.
[218:47.35]I don't want you to know I saw your message and then fucked off for an hour.
[219:06.98]Did you find that weed helped with your ADHD?
[219:09.70]I'm not going to be a proponent for any medical advice that's between you and your doctor.
[219:18.22]Not me.
[219:25.85]Where are these things on the ground?
[219:28.61]Yep.
[219:35.41]I mean, everybody has different situations.
[219:37.68]Everybody's got a completely different chemistry and they have bodies.
[219:40.70]And I know I don't I don't I ain't going down that road.
[219:47.04]I will say, like, you know, cannabis in general is is a very calming thing, but it also can be it can be anxiety inducing for a lot of people, too.
[219:55.99]So it kind of depends on who you are.
[219:59.67]I know people that will not consume any cannabis at all, ever.
[220:04.66]Because they've had, you know, oh, I take it and I just feel like fucking crazy and I feel all over the place and I get like really anxious.
[220:13.70]And for some people, like I do it.
[220:18.59]I like it.
[220:19.45]I like it.
[220:20.81]I honestly, the reason why I started doing it was because
[220:24.04]all the kind of I don't know maybe like all the I was on my chest and like my I have like a hernia but no I'm not gonna tell somebody to do something that's between that's a conversation for you and your care provider your doctor or like you know parents and that that ain't me
[220:58.15]Where are these things?
[221:00.58]Yeah, self medication can get really, really messy.
[221:12.36]Did you ever figure that out, by the way?
[221:14.18]Um, not really.
[221:15.70]I mean, I had an upper endoscope done and I have a hiatal hernia.
[221:19.60]And also they thought it was costochondritis.
[221:23.38]But it's probably, I have a little hiatal hernia.
[221:26.46]And it's like not really big enough to be a huge problem.
[221:30.40]And it's a, I would have to have laryoscopic surgery on it.
[221:35.02]So it's like, and that would be elective.
[221:37.28]So.
[221:41.11]But I'm doing alright.
[221:42.23]I'm doing okay.
[221:43.45]I've obviously had this problem for a very long time and it's probably at some point here into my 40s I will probably do it.
[221:56.27]Just get it out of the way and just get it over with.
[222:02.02]Yeah, I think if it's under a certain centimeter, it's not like, I don't think it's like required to operate on.
[222:08.48]And by the way, I don't, I could be just fucking talking shit right now.
[222:13.91]But I believe anything, if you have a hiatal hernia under a few centimeters, it's almost like not worth operating on.
[222:23.45]Or it's like, I don't know.
[222:24.81]Let me see if I get that right.
[222:31.17]I might have to layer where all these things... It's not worth the XP for the surgeon.
[222:38.73]That's true.
[222:39.19]Oh, there's one.
[222:43.16]Hold on.
[222:43.32]It's like a scratch versus a gash.
[222:49.06]Yeah, and I just might be hypersensitive to it.
[222:52.22]And it's definitely... I'll take the layer.
[222:56.24]Why don't you?
[223:05.91]uh it's possible my body is just really sensitive to the pain and the receptors in my kind of lower esophagus and like upper abdomen but it's also to this might be something else going on and I don't know I've got this who knows at this point you gotta kind of just figure it out
[223:28.69]I went to more... I got really jaded on going to the doctor just because I'd gone so many times for it.
[223:34.47]And it's just like, man, what the fuck?
[223:36.81]Is it really just that?
[223:37.71]Is that the problem?
[223:40.30]So should I just get the surgery or... I don't know.
[223:47.64]But I'm doing fine.
[223:48.22]I'm doing good.
[223:50.04]I'm sure as the years go by, I will have a much clearer picture of everything going on with my health.
[224:00.83]Don't worry about me.
[224:01.49]I don't want people to worry about me.
[224:03.63]The last thing I want is people to be like, hmm, let me speculate on what the fuck is happening.
[224:08.06]No, don't do that.
[224:09.02]I'm good.
[224:10.24]I'm fine.
[224:21.77]You gonna do a garden?
[224:23.89]Yeah, I'll probably do a garden this year.
[224:31.35]Holly wants to do tomatoes.
[224:32.69]I think that'd be fun.
[224:36.43]I'm just afraid of bugs eating them all.
[224:46.89]Do tomatoes do well in high degree temperature?
[224:49.63]100 plus, 115 plus degrees Fahrenheit?
[225:01.44]Do they?
[225:03.22]They love the sun.
[225:04.02]I know the sunflowers that we do, those things turn into monsters because just in Vegas, you get seven or eight straight months of complete uninterrupted bright sunshine.
[225:17.08]Hot, bright sun for eight months.
[225:20.78]So sunflowers turn into mutants out here.
[225:24.02]Oh, what is this?
[225:28.01]Where is this person?
[225:33.04]Am I crazy?
[225:35.12]Oh, I think they walk around.
[225:36.32]Oh, I gotta get my new abilities.
[225:44.71]Does eating mayo help with your ADHD?
[225:51.39]Would you like the services of a priest?
[225:54.39]Um... I would say yes, but I do want the experience.
[226:01.24]Because I am kind of falling behind here.
[226:04.40]I do appreciate it though.
[226:06.36]But I need the full experience if I'm going to get out of the 1 to 10 zone.
[226:13.27]I don't get the three spiders joke in the stream title.
[226:16.01]What even is the title?
[226:27.96]Level one, late to the party, but I brought a bag of double cheeseburgers plus three spiders.
[226:34.40]I don't know.
[226:34.68]I think a mod did that.
[226:42.55]I thought get a priest to help with your hernia.
[226:50.21]Do you call like an exorcist?
[226:52.64]Alright, where's the demon?
[226:53.86]Where are they?
[226:55.89]Well, actually, I kind of want you to do like a talk into my chest.
[227:00.83]What?
[227:08.92]What is this?
[227:10.58]Coarse thread.
[227:24.03]Get rid of the hernia demons.
[227:27.63]Alright, I could go... This is the undercity.
[227:30.02]I have to go there eventually and get the flight path.
[227:35.92]That's a little too high.
[227:36.88]I'm not messing around there.
[227:38.68]Could go up here.
[227:44.43]Over to the pumpkin patch.
[227:53.30]This is the start, I believe, of the Voidwalker quest.
[227:58.92]Is a hernia a hemorrhoid?
[228:00.67]Sorry, English is not my first language.
[228:03.33]A hiatal hernia is when a part of your esophagus has been pulled down into your stomach.
[228:15.69]And it's sort of pinching the bottom part of your stomach.
[228:19.61]I think it's the other way around.
[228:21.88]One way or the other.
[228:23.52]Your stomach is like pinched up in your esophagus like a little bit.
[228:32.43]And... Yeah.
[228:38.71]Sounds like a Resident Evil transformation.
[228:41.59]I'll go get this quest.
[228:42.23]I gotta go to Undercity anyways.
[228:43.45]Let's go.
[228:43.84]We can just run.
[228:44.74]I need to set auto run to a different button.
[228:53.54]Num lock?
[228:54.08]No, I'll use this.
[229:01.90]Got a thread.
[229:03.44]Oh, you can just buy a thread, right?
[229:07.70]Herniates up into the thoracic cavity now.
[229:12.11]How much longer are you streaming for?
[229:13.43]As long as I'm still having fun.
[229:19.07]I'm actually, this is, I actually like this a lot.
[229:23.53]It's, uh, this is kind of exactly what I was hoping it was going to be.
[229:29.81]Wow was a great game just to kind of chill and just do nothing and either talk or not or... Okay, be careful.
[229:46.87]Uh, you can die here.
[229:48.49]This is actually where a lot of people die.
[229:53.62]I'm not making that up.
[229:54.94]For those of you that don't know, there's an elevator that goes down to the Undercity, and it kills probably 50 people a day.
[230:04.42]Oh, I know.
[230:04.92]Yeah, he... Oh, trust me, I know.
[230:13.80]The joke has been already said.
[230:15.28]Okay, if you want to be, if this is going to be a stream where I played WoW for three hours and did like a laugh out loud, I died in hardcore, I would do it here.
[230:24.32]And I would turn my webcam on and put my hands on my head and just get the thumbnail and then, and then leave.
[230:33.00]I hate this place though.
[230:33.94]This place sucks.
[230:35.84]I get lost in here so much.
[230:36.96]Alright, here we are.
[230:38.14]Everyone be careful.
[230:39.26]Oh my God, I fucking freaked out.
[230:46.33]do it either okay if you don't get right in I and I just like I almost just killed three people I just baited three people okay go go go if you don't do this and you walk in now you will fall and you won't hit this until it lands and you'll die from fall damage I just like I just oh my god like my throat just got tight I just got so scared that I was gonna mess that up
[231:16.31]Why did that scare me so much?
[231:17.83]Hey, this is the undercity, though.
[231:20.51]This place sucks.
[231:23.42]Don't ever come here unless you are forced to.
[231:24.94]Uh, I have to turn this... I think it's out here.
[231:31.30]Don't go in the acid.
[231:31.94]The acid is an instant kill.
[231:33.82]Oh, that's... 07, everybody, come on!
[231:50.50]How do you get out of this?
[231:52.38]I hate this place.
[232:00.33]I like the undead characters.
[232:01.65]I just don't like the undead area.
[232:02.95]I like the vibe of it.
[232:13.35]It's just.
[232:16.08]It just reminds me of Stormwind.
[232:19.14]With the kind of the mage quarter, the rogue quarter, the apothecary.
[232:23.45]Stormwind kind of does the Disney World approach too.
[232:26.79]But everything is just so annoyingly spread out here.
[232:30.13]And there's only one or two specific ways you can get to any place.
[232:32.97]It's just annoying.
[232:37.10]Please visit Sylvanas.
[232:38.10]Please, please, please.
[232:40.50]Sylvanas is all the way down here.
[232:41.48]I'm not going there.
[232:49.09]Alright.
[232:54.64]Lich's identity.
[233:00.44]Bring the Lich's spell book to Beethor Ice Shard in the Undercity.
[233:04.58]This is... Queen will want him.
[233:07.26]I have people... This quest text is cool.
[233:09.56]The lore.
[233:09.94]There's a lot of cool lore here.
[233:12.70]But I'm trying to get to level 10.
[233:18.79]Where is it?
[233:26.72]Okay, there it is up there.
[233:31.54]Can I do anything else?
[233:35.28]Are you usually Horde or Alliance?
[233:36.52]I would typically play Alliance, but everybody that is playing right now, at least on the streamer world, some of my friends in particular, played Horde.
[233:48.26]Only Fangs is Horde.
[233:52.08]Etalyx is playing Horde.
[233:53.22]This, you know, Poke was playing Horde.
[233:58.78]People that I know were playing Horde.
[234:00.84]So I played Horde.
[234:04.76]Okay.
[234:06.48]I need to go to... Where is it?
[234:09.32]Where is the...
[234:18.73]Oh, it's up there, OK.
[234:20.53]I need to learn something.
[234:33.68]Etalyx is here right now.
[234:34.72]Yeah, I think if I got there fast enough, the idea was maybe we would do.
[234:43.48]Rage far.
[234:48.41]Oh, I don't learn portals.
[234:53.53]I'm a warlock.
[234:56.59]Are they underneath?
[234:57.21]Where the hell are these guys?
[234:58.01]There we go.
[235:08.24]Alright, this one's really important.
[235:10.78]It's another damage spell.
[235:13.30]Curse of Agony.
[235:16.21]So this is a long dot.
[235:18.67]It starts off slow and then builds up at the end.
[235:21.45]Another case of I'm just doing destruction anyways and I'm going to be just throwing bolts at people.
[235:28.01]But it's good to have.
[235:30.29]This is also good to... I'll get both of these.
[235:33.58]I'll get them all.
[235:34.86]I can afford it as well.
[235:39.04]Take a look at my health.
[235:43.22]This is how warlocks kill themselves.
[235:47.88]Very dangerous.
[235:54.84]This will help, but fear in hardcore is usually really, really bad.
[236:01.43]Why is your icon pulsating?
[236:03.07]It's because I'm in an inn.
[236:04.17]Okay, we're good.
[236:21.50]Wait, I spent like a month trying to find Etalyx on YouTube when I was very young.
[236:24.88]I only heard it spoken on Jerma Rumble and kept typing Etalyx in the search bar.
[236:33.70]How old are you?
[236:34.98]Were you like a little kid?
[236:36.87]I mean, yeah, that was like 10 years ago.
[236:39.35]Ooh, fishing.
[236:45.15]I want to learn that.
[236:46.59]Might as well.
[236:58.02]Yeah, like 10-15 years ago.
[236:59.24]Somebody just said, I was also like 12 when I started.
[237:08.35]Team Fortress, I feel like TF2 and... That game was so good.
[237:16.14]What a fun game.
[237:17.02]I'll buy this thread.
[237:37.78]Oh, it's your feigned death.
[237:38.78]I was like, did you eat a poisonous mushroom or something?
[237:41.94]What the hell just happened?
[237:51.00]Alright, I need to talk to the flight path.
[238:00.18]I don't even have another flight path, do I?
[238:08.56]The STK released?
[238:09.54]Yeah, that's true.
[238:12.12]Talked about it a couple days ago.
[238:17.50]I wonder what the community will do with it.
[238:20.06]I'm sure Valve probably has a similar... I didn't even... I forgot about my tea again.
[238:23.36]What the hell?
[238:26.56]I made a tea this time instead of a coffee.
[238:28.00]Too much caffeine.
[238:41.66]What class do you typically like to main?
[238:43.21]Past or present?
[238:45.17]Shadow Priest is my favorite.
[238:47.35]Out of everything, Shadow Priest and Arcane Mage.
[238:50.81]Arcane Mage turned into the best, most fun thing ever.
[238:58.06]If I were to make any character though, it would probably be Arcane Mage.
[239:00.70]But not in Classic.
[239:01.60]In Classic, it may as well just be like the goofy spec of that.
[239:05.73]They had a bunch of extra moves and they just didn't know what to do with them.
[239:08.33]So they just made another tree.
[239:10.67]Arcane Mage in Classic is completely useless.
[239:13.49]It doesn't do anything.
[239:15.51]There's no reason to be an Arcane Mage all the way down that tree.
[239:22.20]Guys, there's not even an Arcane... Arcane Missiles is in the game?
[239:26.84]But they didn't even, there's not even a regular damage move for Arcane.
[239:31.74]There's no Arcane Blast.
[239:32.98]That didn't, that was not even introduced till the expansion.
[239:36.07]So Arcane, you can't even do it as like a pure spec.
[239:42.41]No, I'm going to sell this.
[239:45.95]Yeah, screw that.
[239:46.62]I'm selling it.
[239:47.12]You guys are wrong.
[239:48.68]Where's the Auction House?
[239:55.45]Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[239:58.15]Hold on.
[240:01.77]If I put this up on the auction house, isn't someone just going to buy it to give me money?
[240:09.55]Isn't this like a, this is like a money laundering scheme.
[240:11.66]I just want to see what it's worth.
[240:17.16]Dude, it's worth less than what you can vendor it for.
[240:28.30]Wait, what about that?
[240:32.84]I got some good shit.
[240:33.56]Hold on.
[240:34.12]What about worn leather vest?
[240:38.99]What is it to list this?
[240:39.91]I just want to prove... I want to prove a point here.
[240:48.96]Wait, is this like... No, wait.
[240:50.46]I'm not doing that.
[240:51.32]Can I get like banned for doing that?
[240:55.11]That is like money laundering in World of Warcraft.
[240:58.67]This is not worth anything either.
[241:02.76]Oh, wait.
[241:03.12]Yeah, I'll get a bag.
[241:09.20]Container bag.
[241:13.08]23 gold.
[241:15.16]Oh, this is the big ones.
[241:21.75]And...
[241:24.78]Tailoring?
[241:26.12]These people are making a killing.
[241:27.32]75 silver for a... You only need to get to 175 tailoring for that?
[241:33.02]That's fucking crazy.
[241:33.95]I'll just get 6 if they're available.
[241:38.07]10 slot.
[241:48.22]What is the 6 slot called?
[241:49.26]Oh, linen bag.
[241:52.30]Okay.
[241:52.72]Is this a good price?
[241:57.39]I can't relate.
[241:59.08]Alright, I don't want to be broke.
[242:11.98]Gonna go play Lethal Company?
[242:13.04]Go play it.
[242:13.70]It's a good ass game.
[242:19.00]But yeah, Arcane Mage... What they did with Arcane Mage... I think this is As of Wrath.
[242:24.12]Or it might have been Legion.
[242:25.18]I don't remember.
[242:26.74]But they made it so you could store Arcane Missiles.
[242:29.16]So you did Arcane Blast, Arcane Blast.
[242:31.03]And you would get these charges of... Of Arcane Missiles.
[242:35.61]And then you could string them together.
[242:36.91]So you would just do a machine gun.
[242:39.21]Where you would be... Arcane Blast, Arcane... Okay, I procced Arcane Missiles.
[242:42.85]Proced Arcane Missiles.
[242:43.89]Proced Arcane Missiles.
[242:44.74]And it was like a rolling dice.
[242:46.06]That's why I liked it.
[242:46.76]It was just kind of gambling.
[242:48.60]Um, so eventually, like, if you got three, and you had a bunch of haste, you would just go... It was awesome.
[242:57.88]It was so satisfying when you could do it.
[243:05.43]Wait a minute.
[243:06.49]I... Where's the thing that I... Okay, I was gonna say, hopefully my mailbox isn't full.
[243:19.03]this person okay you sent three copper look at look at how everybody everybody everybody realized that I'm like hey I don't I don't don't send me things and we went from 10 15 20 gold 2 gold 10 gold 11 copper 42 copper cash on delivery one silver
[243:52.91]Is that good?
[243:55.15]Need to have a return all mail add-on.
[244:02.42]Is this better than what I have?
[244:04.74]Oh, now I get it.
[244:05.26]Alright, let's return all this.
[244:15.93]It's so annoying that because it's such a small amount that I feel like it's okay.
[244:21.56]Like, what?
[244:22.64]What?
[244:22.90]It's just one silver.
[244:24.40]I am going to take this, though.
[244:31.85]Because this doesn't do anything to the game.
[244:33.23]It's just somebody made me a shirt.
[244:34.45]I'm taking it.
[244:42.85]I will make an exception for fashion.
[244:44.39]Appreciate it.
[244:47.19]Thank you.
[245:04.29]You're just sending me shit that's in your inventory.
[245:07.17]Well, yeah.
[245:07.97]It would cost more to send the mail.
[245:09.37]Okay.
[245:20.08]Okay.
[245:21.18]Alright.
[245:21.52]I got my bags.
[245:22.18]I'm good.
[245:23.58]What about that tuxedo?
[245:29.15]Oh, man.
[245:32.53]That's pretty snazzy.
[245:43.55]You look like Colonel Sanders.
[245:52.17]It does kind of look like Colonel Sanders.
[245:54.63]No, it looks like I have a job.
[245:56.25]I work at an office building.
[246:11.48]Much love from Scotland.
[246:13.34]Dipping out.
[246:13.84]Hey, what time is it in Scotland right now?
[246:15.94]4 a.m.
[246:20.71]or 3 a.m.
[246:21.17]or something?
[246:24.77]Midnight?
[246:25.79]Is it 8?
[246:27.77]That's not even that far ahead.
[246:29.67]8 hours ahead?
[246:30.46]5 hours ahead?
[246:32.50]Red Dead Online character?
[246:33.88]Yeah, that's true.
[246:38.92]Okay, I got my bags.
[246:41.34]The question is, do I want to learn a profession?
[246:43.36]And I'm seeing what people are selling bags for.
[246:45.25]I don't know.
[246:52.79]You ever get to Gladiator?
[246:53.93]No.
[246:54.67]The PvP that I did back in the day was I just did Alteric Valley and just smashed my head against a wall and just tried to be useful when you just weren't.
[247:05.12]My PvP extent is getting ganked by a rogue for an hour and a half to the point of me like breaking fucking keyboards.
[247:16.77]Or...
[247:18.73]Uh, just being in Alteric Valley, running into the last boss room, and doing two auto attacks before the guy died.
[247:27.18]And hopefully I got credit for it.
[247:31.76]Alright, I gotta get out of here now.
[247:32.98]Let's get the flight path.
[247:40.77]Rogues in PvP.
[247:41.49]Yeah, a good classic PvP rogue.
[247:45.40]is unbearable.
[247:47.24]They can do cheap shot, and then gouge, and then kidney shot, and you just literally can't play the game.
[247:54.77]The only people that can play the video game at that point is an undead.
[247:59.21]Wait, I don't even have that on the bar.
[248:00.75]What am I doing?
[248:02.11]This.
[248:04.49]Oh, no, no, no.
[248:04.93]Wait.
[248:05.23]Is it human?
[248:06.03]Who has the thing they can get out of that?
[248:12.54]Rogues are unbeatable without PvP trinket, yeah.
[248:15.82]It's the Orc that has it, yeah.
[248:17.54]Will of the Forsaken's good, because Fear sucks, but... Humans, Dwarves, Orc.
[248:25.96]I remember Human Priest was amazing.
[248:29.21]That was my favorite thing to play in Classic, because you got Desperate Prayer.
[248:32.23]It was a 100% heal.
[248:35.63]A full... You could go from one health to 100% in an instant cast.
[248:40.73]It's crazy.
[248:41.65]It's unbelievable.
[248:44.49]Dwarf has fear ward, that's right, but it doesn't matter.
[248:46.89]You can literally... Hardcore?
[248:48.51]Okay, so at least I got this now.
[248:52.03]Let's get out of here.
[248:52.65]I'm kind of just walking around talking.
[249:00.71]Alright, now how do I get out of the Undercity?
[249:02.11]I think you have to go up and then... There we go, yeah.
[249:09.49]There we go, this way.
[249:12.56]I did everything I needed to do in here, right?
[249:24.80]Careful.
[249:25.59]Careful.
[249:26.03]Everybody be careful.
[249:28.81]I always wait for one revolution.
[249:31.17]I don't go in immediately.
[249:32.19]Ever.
[249:40.24]Wait, why are you telling me to stop?
[249:46.18]Hey, it's hardcore, man.
[249:47.70]Oh my god.
[249:48.30]Oh my god.
[249:53.29]Yeah, it's hardcore.
[249:54.51]I'm not messing around.
[249:56.55]If I'm not 100% confident I can get out of that, I'm not doing it.
[250:00.84]Oh, back here.
[250:07.34]Wait, rend?
[250:09.54]That would be great if I got that.
[250:14.29]That's a world buff.
[250:15.61]When somebody turns in a dungeon quest, it gives everybody in a major city a good buff if somebody's going to do it.
[250:22.72]You can't get it in Undercity?
[250:26.24]So again, why would anybody come here?
[250:27.98]This is the shittiest city that the Horde has.
[250:30.80]You can't even get, like, Onyxia buff?
[250:32.94]This place sucks.
[250:33.90]Fucking balls.
[250:41.71]It only drops an Orgrimmar.
[250:50.43]Watch your swears.
[250:51.73]Sorry, I'm
[250:54.69]sorry about that you're gonna ever play league um I would only play league for like money
[251:13.44]The only way I'm playing League is if some fucking, some millionaire, some multi-millionaire is like, hey, I'll give you a million dollars to play League for a week.
[251:22.35]That's the only way.
[251:23.29]And that price is really high because I don't, I've never want to play it.
[251:27.12]I would play League for a million dollars for one week.
[251:35.44]No, actually, sorry, 1.3 million.
[251:37.46]It'll be 1 point- everything that's a million dollars, don't sell yourself short.
[251:42.70]Don't fuck around.
[251:43.64]It's 1.4 million is what you should be asking for, because you're gonna get taxed at like 40 plus percent.
[251:50.65]So, if you want the 1 million, you're actually gonna get like five or six hundred thousand.
[251:56.13]You wanna say 1.4 million, so you get the full million.
[252:05.45]Always consider taxes at that point, because that's about that's if it's five or $600,000, it's just down the drain in taxes.
[252:25.08]Like, oh yeah, man, let's do it for a million.
[252:28.10]Let's do it for a million.
[252:29.60]Oh, a million?
[252:30.76]You mean like 480,000?
[252:34.59]No, 1.5 million, so I get the full 1.0.
[252:36.61]Alright, I'm getting kind of angry here.
[252:49.72]That's my price for everything going forward.
[252:54.01]One day, if someone's just gonna be like, hey, hey, do you want to do this?
[252:56.77]I'll do it for one and a half million dollars.
[252:59.15]Whoa, you're a fucking moron.
[253:00.65]Like, you suck.
[253:01.35]Never mind.
[253:02.27]Okay, see you later.
[253:03.97]One day, what if somebody comes along and it's like, oh, we want you to do this.
[253:06.79]It's 1.5 million.
[253:08.44]Okay.
[253:11.12]Oh, shit.
[253:11.94]Nobody, okay.
[253:14.02]Ooh, nice.
[253:14.76]Firebolt rank two.
[253:27.97]That'll be better.
[253:28.47]Okay, can I do anything else with the imp?
[253:32.45]No, I can't.
[253:35.84]I got everything here.
[253:36.88]Drain soul was good.
[253:38.10]I need that because they start having to use soul shards.
[253:43.14]How often until you're going to get that offer?
[253:45.27]That's not ever going to happen, guys.
[253:49.97]That's never ever going to happen.
[253:51.99]It never did.
[253:58.25]I remember back in, like, 2020, 2021, 22, I was looking.
[254:02.84]I was looking for financing to do a bunch of crazy shit.
[254:06.26]Just came up empty, unfortunately.
[254:12.23]Well, not, like, empty empty, right?
[254:13.79]But, like, there was cases back in the day where it was...
[254:27.07]Is this during the gym arc?
[254:28.69]This was after Dollhouse.
[254:36.75]You'd be surprised to know that a lot of companies like don't just want to fucking spend a shitload of money.
[254:41.76]OK, I think I'm ready.
[254:48.18]To go get the spell book.
[254:55.92]Jeremy, we're wondering if you could help out with the local soup kitchen.
[254:59.34]1.5 million or forget it.
[255:00.42]No, I mean like business transactions, not like volunteer work.
[255:16.03]Did you try selling your soul to the devil?
[255:19.89]No, that's not happening.
[255:21.47]Sorry.
[255:23.61]Nope.
[255:25.61]Nope.
[255:34.76]You already did.
[255:36.50]Well, you see.
[255:37.16]Ooh, shoot.
[255:41.74]I think this water... This place is dangerous.
[255:49.56]Why are you answering these like they're real questions?
[255:53.38]Because it's fun to just... It's fun to just... I don't know, play around.
[255:58.83]It's fun to just talk.
[256:02.46]95% of everything I've ever said is just taking the piss.
[256:05.57]It's just talking.
[256:06.91]I'm just talking.
[256:11.67]Am I stupid?
[256:12.49]Why can't I do this?
[256:15.53]There we go.
[256:17.75]These are not dangerous, thankfully.
[256:35.42]Yeah, I remember this place is scary.
[256:40.97]I think this... Are they murlocs?
[256:42.81]Something spawns in the water.
[256:43.85]I don't know.
[256:44.31]Undead get a ton of water breathing though, so that's great.
[256:49.77]Sorry, I've got three people here that I'm willing to just like push in front of me.
[256:57.46]I know that sounds awful.
[256:58.80]Yeah, these things are level nine.
[256:59.80]Okay, so let's be careful.
[257:10.36]Now, I am... I would help.
[257:13.40]If anything bad happened, I would be there to help.
[257:16.78]Especially when I get the Voidwalker.
[257:18.06]The Voidwalker's a tank.
[257:26.06]Are humans nothing but puppets to you?
[257:29.82]Um, no.
[257:30.64]Humans puppeteering their own puppets in the digital world.
[257:36.53]Uh... Have a...
[257:39.70]I mean, that this person's name is JermaERP.
[257:43.11]Right, like... Does anybody... Are we really going to be that upset about this?
[257:48.39]He's doing... You're doing a pretty good job running away.
[257:52.03]Okay.
[257:52.47]Yeah, you earned it.
[257:53.53]You earned it.
[257:53.87]You guys are that upset that the level 1 JermaERP character is... I don't care if he gets attacked by a shark.
[258:22.78]Shit spawns here very quickly.
[258:24.20]Is this in Only Fangs?
[258:37.79]I am not currently in Only Fangs.
[258:39.91]If I was in Only Fangs, I would probably be in trouble already.
[258:42.67]Because I've been opening mail and I've been using the auction house.
[258:46.49]I think I would be in trouble if I was.
[258:50.66]Oh, there it is.
[258:52.43]Get the book if you need the book.
[258:59.95]How come you know what that is?
[259:01.95]What, like only fans?
[259:08.10]I guess I'm 40.
[259:08.76]How would I not know what that is?
[259:13.98]Guys, the baseball stream was sponsored by Fansly.
[259:19.13]You don't think I didn't know what that was?
[259:26.87]I got the book.
[259:43.90]No, how come you know what ERP is?
[259:45.72]I use the internet!
[259:52.70]And people... What are you talking about?
[259:58.69]Some of you guys think that I'm, like, an animal that is unaware of all things besides, like, eating cookies and, like... You know what I mean?
[260:09.49]I know this shit.
[260:23.38]Uh...
[260:26.55]Alright, I... Not doing that.
[260:29.67]That's a little too high right now.
[260:32.49]I could go that way.
[260:32.97]Let's go back to the town.
[260:35.92]You're 40.
[260:36.46]You're 40.
[260:36.86]Stop thinking about that.
[260:38.32]I'm not thinking about anything.
[260:41.84]I didn't bring it up.
[260:44.50]I'm good.
[260:45.20]I didn't bring it up.
[260:48.14]By the way, how are you even still alive?
[260:53.99]Wait, are you sure you want to challenge Jerma Earp to a duel to the death?
[260:57.42]Your opponent will be able to kill you and death is permanent on her.
[261:00.58]I have to like type.
[261:01.22]I had to type something in.
[261:12.15]Oh, fuck.
[261:12.63]That's right.
[261:13.05]I also have this.
[261:17.07]Right.
[261:17.25]You can eat humanoids as an undead.
[261:19.61]That's right.
[261:23.16]You got scared that you couldn't beat a level one.
[261:25.68]That's actually kind of true.
[261:27.02]So I'm going to prove that I can.
[261:29.20]I agree.
[261:29.80]Oh, you're actually doing it.
[261:49.63]Oh, my pet's going to kill you.
[262:02.59]Alright, I'll kill you with corruption.
[262:04.95]Die in agony.
[262:14.18]Wait, was that what you wanted all along?
[262:16.78]Is that what you wanted all... You probably wanted me to do that.
[262:20.16]Oh, great.
[262:21.12]You probably, like, wanted me to do... It was probably, like, part... What the fuck, dude?
[262:37.19]Now he's bragging.
[262:40.29]I'm not eating their corpse.
[262:41.63]No, that's absolutely not.
[262:43.53]There's no way I'm going to do that.
[262:46.04]One of you guys can go do that.
[262:58.03]You're wasting food.
[262:59.07]That's fine.
[263:00.47]I'm not doing that.
[263:05.79]Oh, that's better.
[263:06.25]Oh, no, I don't want to assault this.
[263:22.76]Okay, let's make the bandages.
[263:25.72]And then I'm going to get up in that stretch.
[263:28.36]No, I'm not peeing every hour.
[263:29.80]I'm just moving around.
[263:33.77]Take responsibility and eat.
[263:35.61]No, it's not even still there anymore.
[263:37.33]Look.
[263:47.80]Fuck.
[263:52.88]Where?
[263:54.38]Wasting food, wasting food.
[263:56.26]I'm not.
[263:57.04]I don't even know.
[263:57.62]I don't know.
[263:58.18]Alright, I'll be back.
[264:06.42]See you guys in three or four minutes.
[264:11.75]And here comes some ads as well.
[264:15.01]Is that redundant?
[264:17.69]Do you guys like that I tell you when they're coming in case somebody doesn't have it in the tab or something?
[264:22.26]I feel like that's helpful.
[264:26.74]Yeah?
[264:27.22]Okay.
[264:27.34]Alright.
[264:28.46]Beer beep.
[265:55.56]Thank you.
[267:22.17]Thank you.
[268:11.75]hello hello how are you finished my tea I got a water I was drinking some rooibos it's very good if you looking for a new tea to enjoy rooibos is very good r-o-o-I-b-u-s rooibos
[268:50.64]I'm not eating it.
[268:52.70]I'm not going to eat this corpse.
[268:57.50]Oh, I have to... Oh, I can do that better.
[269:09.69]Oh.
[269:14.91]is that close it's close they're still talking what about slash silly oh that's right we got jokes
[269:39.70]That's too scary, so I'm going this way.
[269:42.03]The mill's overrun.
[269:43.47]Alright, boon.
[270:09.10]Rooibos is an African tea?
[270:10.18]It is.
[270:12.48]It is not a tea at all, actually.
[270:14.64]It is a... It's a bush, apparently.
[270:18.28]Native to Africa.
[270:21.84]It's very good for digestion.
[270:28.39]You're a liar?
[270:29.19]I'm not a liar.
[270:41.85]I gotta do this.
[270:43.27]In hardcore, you don't ever have your map open.
[270:46.37]Just walking around.
[270:47.11]You never know what the hell you're gonna just pull.
[270:59.42]He comes from a bush too, though.
[271:02.46]I don't know the exact...
[271:05.37]science or reasoning behind it but I know it's not technically a tea leaf it's like a bush I don't know if that matters it's multiplayer Vampire Survivors that sounds kind of crazy
[271:36.21]You thought that Wow was Wizard 101.
[271:38.03]How do I get up there?
[271:49.33]I think Wow is Wizard 101 for older people, like teens and older.
[271:56.23]Isn't Wizard 101 like a preteen kind of game?
[272:01.32]It's for like middle school.
[272:02.70]Is that where people mostly played it?
[272:08.12]Yeah, it's like for a young audience, right?
[272:20.13]I played it when I was 10.
[272:24.03]You know, I wonder what the experience must have been like.
[272:28.55]Because back when I was... Okay, be careful here.
[272:33.67]Back when I was like 10, 11, 12, the internet didn't exist.
[272:39.37]The internet, it was a fairly new concept into my teens.
[272:46.59]So I really wonder what it's like growing up with MMOs available.
[272:52.04]I wonder.
[272:53.04]It's something I just never would have ever experienced.
[272:57.10]I grew up without the internet. ...
[273:09.48]Get addicted to it really young.
[273:15.84]Yeah, and that's... That's kind of unfortunate in a way, isn't it?
[273:21.87]There's a lot of wonderful things about the internet, but... I don't know.
[273:24.75]I feel like if I... I don't know.
[273:25.95]If I had the internet when I was like 10, 11, 12, I would... Especially the person that I know that I am.
[273:33.78]Who the fuck is this guy?
[273:37.06]We're good.
[273:37.32]We're good.
[273:37.54]We're fine.
[273:37.80]We're fine.
[273:38.14]Everyone's fine.
[273:45.80]Oh, I have a level 29 with me.
[273:46.94]Alright, I'll eat this guy.
[274:01.79]I thought somebody trained it.
[274:03.80]I thought somebody grabbed it.
[274:05.04]It's alright, we got bodyguards.
[274:14.74]Helpers.
[274:15.70]Helpers.
[274:20.45]Well, you can only have helpers for so long, guys.
[274:30.78]Why did you say it was more dangerous to drink of river water than toilet water in an old... Oh, hold on.
[274:36.00]Otto's ringing his, um, his bell.
[274:38.81]When I, when Otto wants, I don't know if you heard that, but that's kind of funny that that got captured.
[274:43.64]Um, when Otto's looking for water, he will knock the bowl down.
[274:49.32]If there's no water in the bowl, he'll go like, dunk, dunk.
[274:53.06]So let me get some water.
[274:57.59]Uh, just make sure I don't die.
[275:03.39]I mean, drinking toilet water.
[275:05.95]No, do I?
[275:07.29]River water is not treated by like the city.
[275:10.35]There's all kinds of horrible shit that can be in river water unless you have like a filter or something.
[275:14.36]There's all kinds of bad shit in toilet water too.
[275:17.00]It's bacteria.
[275:17.84]No, don't.
[275:18.22]What are you talking?
[275:19.62]Alright.
[275:20.30]Do you hear that?
[275:21.60]I'm coming.
[275:22.04]I'm coming.
[275:22.34]Alright.
[275:22.64]Give me one second.
[276:29.60]Okay.
[276:32.08]He might want to go outside too.
[276:34.87]We'll see.
[276:36.45]I'm prepared to do that.
[276:46.52]Anyways, drinking river water without a... I didn't mean to click that.
[276:51.26]Drinking river water is not good.
[276:54.18]Because it's not treated.
[276:56.67]Anything that comes through the pipes to your house has gone through a treatment facility.
[277:00.73]Okay.
[277:11.52]So, I mean, if this is a would you rather for me, would you rather drink a full eight ounce glass of water out of a river or out of the toilet?
[277:21.46]I think I would probably pick toilet.
[277:35.12]But it would need to be a clean.
[277:37.27]Can I clean the toilet first?
[277:41.91]Toilet bowl?
[277:42.55]What about toilet tank?
[277:44.37]Oh, I don't know.
[277:45.15]That's bad.
[277:56.76]Scoop it out of the middle.
[278:05.72]I think just doing shadow bolts is just the most effective thing right now.
[278:09.58]Yeah, it is.
[278:10.99]Always the most effective thing in Classic.
[278:22.70]Yeah, I wouldn't... Okay.
[278:24.52]I might pick the river.
[278:27.90]If... I would pick the river if you couldn't confirm with me that the toilet was not used within the last... Oh, man.
[278:37.73]It's got to be like... Ugh.
[278:40.47]If that toilet was used in the last... Oh my god.
[278:44.61]Today.
[278:44.95]Full day.
[278:45.53]Two days.
[278:46.17]No more than that.
[278:51.55]I think I'd probably pick the river.
[278:54.93]I need to like cast spells.
[279:13.14]Oh, rare spawn, rare spawn, rare spawn, rare spawn.
[279:18.06]You can tell it's a rare spawn because it has the silver dragon.
[279:27.03]That sucks.
[279:29.49]Is it at least cool looking?
[279:35.12]Is it better than what I had?
[279:36.54]It's not even better than what I had on.
[279:38.08]I guess it is kind of cool.
[279:39.94]Fashion over function for me right now.
[279:56.39]I like the purple.
[280:06.92]I gotta put this in a bit.
[280:07.62]I don't like it on E. So an Affliction Warlock has like four dots and they just go do-do-do-do-do-do and you just watch them tick down.
[280:17.11]I think there's a couple of bosses I have to kill up here.
[280:29.96]You gotta beat the global cooldown too.
[280:32.73]So if you don't know what I'm trying to do, for those wow noobs that don't even know what the game is, when I cast, let's for instance immolate, right?
[280:41.65]I'm gonna cast immolate.
[280:43.03]The goal is to try to do Curse of Agony now.
[280:46.97]Well, he resisted, but it's fine.
[280:49.91]You try to beat the global cooldown.
[280:51.85]I know about that.
[280:52.57]That means I'm already gonna be doing like 5,000 DPS.
[281:05.76]That was a duel.
[281:21.87]Let me eat this guy.
[281:25.27]Latency buffer.
[281:26.01]He knows his stuff.
[281:29.65]Yeah, you also have to...
[281:32.12]You can spam and try to catch the spell as it ends, but I like to try to just time it.
[281:38.94]So it's right when the bar gets to be like right here, you cast it again.
[281:44.07]And now.
[281:47.67]And now.
[281:53.97]Can we listen to Crawling in the Dark?
[281:58.79]I don't want to nuke the whole VOD.
[282:06.71]What the hell?
[282:13.71]I've got a couple of people here.
[282:16.59]Oh, my poor pet is getting smashed.
[282:17.99]Alright.
[282:33.24]That'll probably be enough.
[282:35.22]No.
[282:44.60]It's too late, uh... You played Kiss from a Rose.
[282:51.76]Seal is gonna get all the revenue from stream.
[282:57.08]That's fine.
[282:59.65]That one portion of the stream, that's fine.
[283:02.09]Okay, for that one second, that one three minute portion.
[283:10.09]By percentage of what has been four or five hours.
[283:17.21]Wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[283:20.65]Where even is this person?
[283:37.36]That's not, wait, Etalyx is level 60?
[283:39.82]What the fuck is going on?
[283:40.84]That's not, this is not even Etalyx.
[283:43.34]I took that, I took that group immediately.
[283:46.60]Is this, no, is this, no it's not?
[283:48.46]Who the fuck are you?
[283:49.10]This is freaking me out.
[284:00.59]Uh, thanks for the lair though.
[284:09.56]Are we going to hit our... Is this an actual imposter?
[284:12.12]This is a fucking real imposter.
[284:13.68]Oh, no, that's... Wait, am I getting re-layered to the other layer I was just on?
[284:25.20]I'm jumping from like one group to the other.
[284:42.43]Professional impersonator.
[284:45.80]What the fuck?
[284:47.18]I'm so confused.
[284:49.36]That had to be one of the most, because I was like, no, he's, is he level 60?
[284:52.88]No.
[284:56.54]He might be, I don't know.
[284:58.58]No, I don't, I do not think so.
[285:06.42]I need one more.
[285:11.16]Don't pull them both.
[285:23.86]There we go.
[285:24.56]Let's get the hell out of here.
[285:30.24]Be careful of layering.
[285:31.26]Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[285:37.37]Do you need to go outside, Otto?
[285:42.83]Well, it's okay because... Oh, shit, I gotta... There's people here I need to kill.
[285:49.63]He's giving me the look.
[285:55.03]You giving me the look?
[285:56.55]Need to go outside?
[286:02.85]There's two other bosses.
[286:04.45]First level 11.
[286:22.84]Sharing experience again.
[286:24.28]Oh, that's right.
[286:30.18]I keep forgetting that, that it splits it.
[286:36.13]Somebody's gonna take a stray Shadow Ball to the face and they're gonna die instantly.
[286:41.21]And it's gonna be pretty funny.
[286:55.80]Resist?
[286:56.28]You're level 7, I'm level 8.
[287:02.54]Will you introduce Vinny to Warcraft?
[287:05.68]We talked on the last time we played a few days ago.
[287:09.00]And I said, would anybody want to do this?
[287:12.31]And I was told no.
[287:17.99]Well, okay, to be fair to Poke, Poke did do this already.
[287:21.19]Like, he did like two or three times leveling.
[287:29.43]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[287:30.23]Alright, things are getting a little hairy for the level ones that are here.
[287:33.63]Whoa, what was that?
[287:53.65]Ooh, cool.
[287:55.97]Letter written by Thurman, the eldest son of Gregor Argamand.
[288:00.27]Okay.
[288:02.08]Deliver the letter.
[288:03.60]Sure.
[288:04.06]Free experience.
[288:04.66]I'll take it.
[288:12.94]I think this person's upstairs.
[288:15.02]Oh, God.
[288:15.60]Be careful, careful, careful.
[288:16.82]Level 10.
[288:31.47]It's not that bad.
[288:31.99]I'm a liability.
[288:36.66]Well, you're definitely in the way, which could be good.
[288:40.02]That might not be a bad thing.
[288:44.46]If you eat a Frostbolt and get crit and die, that's a Frostbolt that's not going to hit a normal Chris, for instance.
[288:55.30]The only add-ons that I have, I have Questy and Atlas loot and the details with threat meter.
[289:04.53]That's all I have.
[289:12.24]That's kind of a lot.
[289:17.21]I don't like having a bunch of add-ons because anytime I ever see anybody that has a ton of add-ons, you see their giant UI is different and all this stuff.
[289:23.77]And they're always kind of like the computer is always crashing and they're always disconnecting and they have to like reload their UI all the fucking time.
[289:30.21]I don't want to do that in hardcore.
[289:32.53]Okay, I gotta go into the barn.
[289:36.47]Yeah.
[289:44.40]Nobody does that.
[289:49.46]I always thought that all the add-ons, if you have a shitload of add-ons, they can cause a ton of problems.
[289:54.93]I'm not talking one or two, I'm talking, like, twenty.
[290:00.59]You've been level eight for two hours.
[290:06.06]Hey, it's not a race!
[290:18.33]Six hours, not even level 10.
[290:21.67]No, it's been four and a half hours because I... Okay, this person is going to die.
[290:27.70]I don't want to aggro this, but I think I just did.
[290:33.32]I'm going to get to level 10 in an hour.
[290:39.73]Yeah, but then somebody asked me if I would drink water out of the river or a toilet, and I spent like 45 minutes talking about it, so...
[291:06.63]That was 10 minutes ago?
[291:12.23]Wait, what's the rush?
[291:20.66]I'm so scared to do anything in hardcore though, even dungeons.
[291:24.26]Because once you get past
[291:25.99]You know, like whaling caverns.
[291:30.89]You get to Shadowfang Keep and Razorfen and those places are so scary.
[291:37.16]It's so easy just to die in there.
[291:38.70]It is so easy.
[291:43.81]One bad poll that everybody just dies.
[291:54.68]Alright, looking for Gregor's remains.
[291:59.64]Look of a Gregor.
[292:03.20]Anybody see a Gregor?
[292:04.36]Is your heartbeat faster than most peoples?
[292:19.37]Last time I had my heart rate, next time I checked it, I think it was 77, 75 to like 80.
[292:23.69]It usually is about 76 to 77.
[292:47.82]So that's normal.
[292:48.62]I think normal is anywhere between 60 and 90, right?
[292:50.56]The only time a heart rate becomes a major concern is if it's always consistently above 90 to 100.
[292:56.49]There's Gregor.
[293:20.86]We can do Molten Core.
[293:22.08]I don't think we're going to be able to do Molten Core with this group.
[293:24.79]I want to close this up.
[293:28.93]I can't close my bar.
[293:30.73]Oh my god, what the fuck is all this?
[293:32.45]Oh, this is a quest-y shit.
[293:35.05]Okay.
[293:39.72]Alright, the last one's over here.
[293:40.74]61 to 76 according to my watch.
[293:47.66]That's pretty good.
[293:48.48]That's actually really good.
[294:05.92]Oops.
[294:08.06]Yeah, I'll let Otto up.
[294:10.94]He's doing okay.
[294:11.62]He's just chilling now.
[294:12.52]He kind of was giving me the look.
[294:15.27]I'll let him out when I get up in a minute here.
[294:20.03]120 consistently.
[294:21.31]If your heart rate is 120 all the time, I would consider maybe bringing that up to the doctor.
[294:30.70]I think that's kind of high.
[294:43.87]Uh, Thurman.
[294:44.61]That's what we're looking for.
[294:45.58]That's like a hummingbird.
[294:50.60]That is, that's, yeah, that's really fast.
[294:56.97]200 while active?
[294:58.91]No, that's, is that accurate?
[295:00.99]I think 170, 180, right?
[295:20.84]What do you think about the meteor that's going to hit in 2032?
[295:26.12]Well, I hope that the 97% chance for it to miss.
[295:30.88]Let's just hope it doesn't land on zero.
[295:32.62]You know, zero, double zero are on the map, are on the board.
[295:44.64]Hey, you know what?
[295:46.48]If a meteor is going to hit the Earth in 10 years, hey, why don't you make the next 10 pretty damn good then, okay?
[295:53.83]How's that sound?
[296:04.76]There, okay.
[296:05.48]Spawn's right here, I think.
[296:06.78]Food crate!
[296:18.61]Gross.
[296:27.94]Urban?
[296:29.02]Where are you?
[296:37.05]Let's not talk about the asteroid.
[296:38.19]It's not going to happen.
[296:39.95]I think that it's not going to happen.
[296:41.99]And I think that the more that we all collectively say it's not going to happen, the more that that positive thought, if we just all think that way, the meteor will miss us.
[296:57.17]Or we're all going to be holding hands, doing positive thoughts, and we're going to watch it come down to Earth and just fucking wipe us all out while we're doing our positive thought routine.
[297:18.50]Hey look, it's Thurman.
[297:33.09]There we go.
[297:36.69]Eat.
[297:36.89]2.9% chance.
[297:43.44]Oh, you're talking about dropping a purple.
[297:44.72]I thought you're talking about the chance for the meteor to hit.
[297:46.44]I think it's the same.
[297:47.04]I think it's the same.
[297:52.23]Bio fin scales.
[297:55.03]I don't know if I want to do that.
[297:56.39]Yeah, I'll do that when I come back.
[297:57.79]I'll go through here and do it.
[298:00.27]I got to turn all this in and I got to let auto up.
[298:06.39]It reminded me that I didn't put this on.
[298:08.85]You're going to get me killed.
[298:15.44]We can make a force field out of positive energy.
[298:21.77]If like 10,000 of you were standing kind of 50 feet away from me...
[298:26.00]And all of you, and don't fuck around, if nobody was messing around and not doing it, if all of you were just sitting there saying:
[298:34.00]He's not going to get hurt, he's not going to get hurt, he's not going to get hurt, he's not going to get hurt.
[298:40.00]Saying it in unison together and you really believed it, and somebody's just driving at me going 60 miles per hour in a car.
[298:46.00]And I just stood there, like, do you think, could we make it happen?
[299:02.22]He's not going to get hurt.
[299:03.34]He's not going to get hurt.
[299:04.48]He's not going to get hurt.
[299:05.36]There's like 20,000 people in a stadium.
[299:08.78]And I have... Ooh, what's this?
[299:12.24]Dog shit?
[299:13.04]Nice.
[299:13.74]Okay, we got dog shit robes.
[299:16.01]I might just be a tailor and just learn this and make it.
[299:24.24]And the whole time, and I have like fucking veneers.
[299:27.24]I have big, like bright white teeth and I'm in like a, I don't know, like a big like sequined suit and shit.
[299:32.61]And I'm like, I'm going to live.
[299:34.79]I'm going to be fine.
[299:35.85]I put on like a, like a deep, deep Southern accent.
[299:45.87]He's not going to get hurt.
[299:47.12]He's not going to, I'm not going to get hurt.
[299:49.12]He's not going to get hurt.
[299:50.28]He said, I'm going to be fine.
[299:51.76]I'm going to be just fine.
[300:08.01]I just kind of repeat what you guys say, but a little more enthusiastically into like a microphone.
[300:17.11]That's just people in the game, right?
[300:18.43]That's chatters in the game right now.
[300:21.95]The only difference is everyone would be chanting, he's not going to get hurt.
[300:26.26]He's not going to get hurt.
[300:28.00]And then everyone would, somebody, a few of like, like this crew here, somebody would realize that this guy's going to get hurt.
[300:34.84]He's going to get hurt.
[300:36.08]And they push me out of the way and get hit by the car instead.
[300:39.72]And then everybody would say, oh, but you see, it would have worked if it wasn't for the fact that it would have worked on, on Jerma, right?
[300:50.61]And people would still believe.
[301:01.28]A self-fulfilling prophecy, yeah.
[301:06.10]You're asking if we can collectively cast Power Word Shield.
[301:08.25]Yeah, that kind of is what I'm asking, yeah.
[301:13.55]Well, I remember that we had the conversation before where I asked, and I never got a real good answer by this, by the way, is how many people would it take?
[301:20.54]Because heat is energy.
[301:23.76]And, um, remember we talked about the steak that was in the box, the raw steak in the box, and how, if you could, how, how much, how many people screaming at a steak would it take for it to cook it?
[301:36.01]You guys remember that one?
[301:36.99]It's kind of similar.
[301:40.03]Like how many people screaming in a room would cook the steak?
[301:45.17]Because of the energy transfer.
[301:48.55]Like if you had, uh, let's say 50,000 people have like a long, like tube that they can put up to their mouth and go scream into it.
[301:57.93]And all those get pumped into one spot where there is one piece of raw steak in a, in a sealed room.
[302:05.48]What would happen to the steak?
[302:06.76]Would it get to like medium rare?
[302:10.75]Would it get to even rare?
[302:11.65]Would it get to rare?
[302:14.48]By like supersonic airwaves.
[302:28.54]Steak slapping hypothesis?
[302:32.99]That steak would stink.
[302:35.97]Oh my god, it'd be awful.
[302:38.72]Can you imagine having to smell like 50,000 people's gross ass breath at the same time?
[302:45.09]And that shit would come back through the pipe too.
[302:46.95]Because I'm imagining everyone's not in the same room.
[302:53.09]You know, we're like 200 yards away with long, kind of, you know, when you put the two cups and you can, oh, talk through one cup and it goes through the string.
[303:01.02]That's what I'm talking about.
[303:01.92]But there's like 50,000 people doing that.
[303:05.33]You'd get back... It would backlog up the line.
[303:09.58]And you would get somebody that just didn't brush their teeth that day.
[303:12.22]It would just go up your line.
[303:14.62]And it would be awful.
[303:20.50]No, you cannot peer pressure a steak to cook.
[303:23.27]No, but the vibrations and it's the sound waves.
[303:28.08]Guys, we have radio waves cook food.
[303:30.78]You don't... Effectively, your microwave is screaming at your fucking old rice pilaf that you had three days ago.
[303:36.49]That's kind of what's happening.
[303:56.16]What would you ask of death?
[303:58.46]Did I get anything for this?
[303:59.20]Ooh, I get better pants.
[304:00.30]Nine.
[304:00.64]What is armor?
[304:03.66]What does armor actually do for you?
[304:04.86]Physical attacks.
[304:07.94]The amount of reduction is influenced by the level of the attacker.
[304:09.98]Yep.
[304:10.16]Alright.
[304:11.82]So it's about... It's just a percentage based, right?
[304:14.28]So that's going to be pretty high.
[304:15.32]What is it now?
[304:16.62]9.7% reduction.
[304:19.58]What does it change to?
[304:23.58]Damn.
[304:24.36]Alright.
[304:24.96]That was a full percent.
[304:26.90]Well, not really, but whatever.
[304:47.53]Oh, I didn't get the pumpkins yet.
[304:48.55]Shit.
[304:48.97]Uh-oh.
[304:52.63]Delivery to Silverpine.
[304:54.07]Why does it say I have a quest?
[305:01.38]That's weird.
[305:01.70]Okay.
[305:12.70]What would we scream into it?
[305:13.70]It couldn't be a sentence.
[305:15.53]It would have to just be just yell or even like a tone, right?
[305:20.61]If everybody just went like, instead of screaming, if everybody went at the same time through it.
[305:42.98]No one's going to buy this.
[305:45.28]But maybe I might do tailoring.
[305:47.68]What is the... Okay, I did leatherworking on my hunter.
[305:51.27]And I think my other warlock has... Alchemy, maybe?
[305:57.01]It's not.
[305:57.41]It's really low.
[305:58.11]What is probably the most useful?
[305:59.75]Engineering, but I don't know if I want to do engineering.
[306:02.97]Alchemy seems fun.
[306:04.00]You just give yourself buffs.
[306:11.31]To generate 250 watts, you'd need 250 people yelling at the stake.
[306:15.43]Will you ask ChatGPT this?
[306:16.82]Are you getting a real answer?
[306:21.34]Alchemy is useful and easy.
[306:22.38]Enchanting.
[306:22.84]Enchanting would be good too.
[306:30.07]ChatGPT.
[306:31.29]I don't know if I got that right.
[306:38.91]A real answer from a LLM, yeah.
[306:45.70]Yeah, asking chat GPT, is it theoretically possible to cook a steak with enough people by yelling at it?
[306:52.86]It's probably gonna, it'll start quoting like Ernest Hemingway fucking poetry and stuff.
[306:57.62]Yeah, you're gonna, you'll get, I don't know if it'll be accurate.
[307:06.70]Maybe I'll do tailoring.
[307:09.25]The problem with tailoring though is that you cannibalize your bandage increases because this is so important in hardcore.
[307:17.67]You have to use it for both, which I don't know if I like that.
[307:33.02]What about cooking an egg?
[307:34.14]It wouldn't take as much heat to cook that.
[307:36.08]Yeah, that's true.
[307:37.72]It doesn't have to be a steak, I guess.
[307:42.54]Warlock's got the self-healing.
[307:45.62]You get life tap and life drain.
[307:47.78]Life tap is an affliction, though.
[307:48.98]I wouldn't be going down that far.
[307:58.84]Let's see, somebody's got it here.
[308:00.18]While sound does carry energy, the amount of energy you produce by yelling is minuscule compared to what's needed to heat a steak.
[308:08.48]In theory, if you could deliver enough acoustic power and couple it efficiently to the meat, you could heat it up.
[308:15.00]But a human yell is nowhere near sufficient for cooking a steak.
[308:18.28]Essentially, your vocal cords simply can't generate nearly enough energy to raise the steak's temperature to a safe cooked level.
[308:23.37]Well, that's one person.
[308:24.73]You have to ask it about 10,000 people.
[308:30.68]Yeah, one person can't do it.
[308:32.76]But ask ChatGPT if 10,000 people can do it.
[308:40.55]Yeah, what about like a million people?
[308:42.93]This could be the pinnacle of humanity.
[308:46.39]We could get every country together on Earth.
[308:49.03]Every country on Earth could come together.
[308:51.07]And we could achieve something together.
[308:55.31]Everybody would be like...
[308:56.90]Okay, here we go.
[308:57.90]We have achieved complete world peace.
[309:00.24]We're all going to yell into our tubes to scream at the stake and we're going to hit the pinnacle of humanity.
[309:07.57]Ready?
[309:08.71]Everybody over there!
[309:10.21]In China!
[309:11.35]Yeah, we're ready!
[309:12.95]In the United States of America!
[309:14.48]Yeah, let's go!
[309:15.74]Where are we?
[309:17.28]In Europe, and Australia, and Russia, and Asia, and fucking Africa, and Australia!
[309:28.63]Are we ready?
[309:31.24]Three, two, one.
[309:37.65]And then the fucking meteor hits.
[309:45.63]Did we get to do it?
[309:49.11]China and Asia.
[309:55.31]I didn't even say South America.
[309:56.87]That better be good.
[310:03.74]You're insane.
[310:05.02]I'm just... No, I'm not.
[310:06.30]We're just talking.
[310:07.67]This is WoW talk.
[310:08.57]This is WoW conversations.
[310:21.82]Cool.
[310:24.64]Oh, they're upstairs.
[310:32.43]Double?
[310:32.91]You mentioned Australia double times?
[310:34.48]Two times?
[310:34.96]I did?
[310:35.42]Oh, no.
[310:35.74]Yeah, I did.
[310:38.60]You're right.
[310:41.08]But who would eat the steak?
[310:44.66]I don't know.
[310:48.01]I... No, it would be preserved.
[310:49.41]Forever.
[310:49.69]Is the enchanter... No.
[310:53.99]No.
[310:56.78]We'd put it in a piece of glass.
[310:59.18]And it would be... We would then open.
[311:01.84]It would be the culmination.
[311:03.58]It would be called the World Museum.
[311:08.09]Where, like, we all came together and, like, that's the first item in the World Museum.
[311:17.15]And then we could put other stuff in it, too.
[311:18.74]Like, every country.
[311:20.54]Every country has, like, a section.
[311:21.64]How cool would that be?
[311:22.32]Don't you think that'd be awesome?
[311:25.66]Imagine there was a museum that had, how many countries are on Earth?
[311:29.56]Like two something, three something, two, like 95.
[311:32.17]What is it?
[311:33.53]Imagine there was like a, like a, a giant campus that had a bunch, like every country had like a section of like their history and all these things.
[311:40.00]And that'd be really difficult to manage.
[311:44.46]That'd be like tens of thousands of items that would need an entire country worth of people to do.
[311:54.75]Where is this turn in?
[311:59.44]Downstairs?
[312:07.10]Epcot exists.
[312:10.62]Uh, last time I checked, Epcot had 10 countries, not 300.
[312:14.96]Actually, Epcot had 300 spots to go visit.
[312:17.10]Alright, uh...
[312:25.11]I might take another break here.
[312:34.62]Where do you get your shit?
[312:35.48]I need what you're on.
[312:36.52]Um, it's called natural.
[312:39.22]Um, I drank a peppermint tea and I drank a rooibos tea and just I'm chilling.
[313:02.91]You gonna chug Dr. Pepper again?
[313:04.25]No, I think those years are, those years are gone.
[313:09.20]Those are my YouTube intro years.
[313:13.34]Back in the day where you were like terrified that if you uploaded a video and people didn't know exactly what it was before they saw it, you had to explain the whole video for the first two or three minutes.
[313:25.18]That's back in the YouTuber days.
[313:26.54]That's back when the... Here, I'm going to play this game.
[313:28.74]Before you see the game, I'm going to tell you about the thing I'm about to do for two straight minutes.
[313:35.14]Alright, where am I going next?
[313:44.31]I'm almost level 10, right?
[313:46.39]Almost there.
[313:51.67]People still do that?
[313:54.01]Yeah, but mine were long.
[313:56.11]Mine were really long.
[313:58.09]And if I go back and look at my YouTube analytics, you can see the... Hey guys, so to... Skip.
[314:04.95]Okay, now we're playing the game.
[314:08.47]Mine were like sometimes three to four minutes long.
[314:10.59]Five minutes sometimes.
[314:19.59]I would like describe the entire video.
[314:29.05]What about your stream intros?
[314:30.43]Well, imagine the stream intro.
[314:31.61]I told you what I was gonna do.
[314:37.19]Fuck.
[314:39.72]Oh, I still do it.
[314:41.70]And now it's like 20 minutes.
[314:47.56]Yeah, but hold on a second though, before anybody gives me shit over that.
[314:52.02]Keep in mind, very importantly.
[314:57.05]But hold on.
[314:58.69]My stream starting soon screen, I talk almost... We've gone over this.
[315:04.52]I talk almost immediately.
[315:07.32]When it's like, the stream just went live, here we are.
[315:11.32]Music is starting.
[315:12.60]Within one minute, I'm talking.
[315:17.63]I could have a starting soon screen for 10 to 20 minutes.
[315:20.95]And then spend 30 minutes telling you what I'm going to do today.
[315:24.89]Oh man, would that be unbearable.
[315:28.56]New viewers all the time.
[315:29.38]It makes sense.
[315:30.58]Okay.
[315:30.80]You want to go outside?
[315:33.46]Where am I going?
[315:34.14]I'm doing the World of Warcraft.
[315:35.42]Walk in a circle and talk.
[315:37.55]Yeah, I'm pacing.
[315:38.59]It's alright.
[315:39.71]It's what you do.
[315:43.37]That's what you do.
[315:48.83]Yeah, so my intros would end up being an hour long.
[316:00.01]Wow.
[316:00.31]Invented walking in circles.
[316:01.61]Yeah.
[316:01.81]Jerma, play retail.
[316:04.07]No.
[316:04.83]Okay.
[316:05.09]Let's see.
[316:05.35]Let's put it this way.
[316:05.89]Alright.
[316:07.96]It's been about five.
[316:08.78]I'm still going.
[316:09.30]I'm not done.
[316:09.82]I'm addicted.
[316:10.68]I want to play.
[316:12.02]But I do want... I'm just very curious.
[316:16.62]Do you... I wanted to get to level 10 today.
[316:19.42]That was the goal.
[316:20.04]To get to at least level 10.
[316:21.24]Maybe a little bit further and do the first dungeon.
[316:25.51]But...
[316:27.35]Can we get a poll?
[316:28.97]I want, I'm looking for like an 80 plus percent.
[316:33.47]This is, I would like to do this.
[316:35.07]Did you have, have you been enjoying what you've been seeing?
[316:38.01]And would you be, how would you feel if you saw a shitload more of this?
[316:46.15]Finish Nancy Drew.
[316:47.15]Oh yeah.
[316:50.41]Yeah.
[316:50.81]Poor Nancy Drew.
[316:52.79]She's been trying to figure out that, that Thornton Hall case for,
[316:57.81]A month now.
[317:02.05]It's chill.
[317:02.61]Yeah, I'm going to continue to do it.
[317:06.15]I just want to see how people feel about it.
[317:09.47]It looks like most people said yeah.
[317:13.75]I mean, if this was like 40%, yes, or like 50%, then it's like, people really don't want to see this.
[317:18.97]But at the end of the day, I'm just going to do what I feel like doing.
[317:22.41]I feel like doing this.
[317:31.91]Play Astro Bot?
[317:34.27]I could play Astro Bot.
[317:35.29]Alright.
[317:37.35]Rank 1 Gladiator on retail.
[317:39.41]I wonder how long that would take.
[317:40.33]I'm high enough level.
[317:46.51]I want to get to level 10 before I go anywhere dangerous though.
[317:53.70]Like seeing you do stuff that you like to do?
[317:58.06]Yeah.
[317:58.64]No, I...
[318:01.15]I very much am enjoying this.
[318:03.13]And it's easy just to kind of hang out and talk too.
[318:06.61]Weirdly enough, I have a ton of problems with paying attention to games and being like, which direction do I go?
[318:12.78]Guys, where do I go?
[318:14.56]But like, I love, I've been playing this game for two decades.
[318:19.32]I'm going to get lost and I'm going to get fucked up and I'm going to get killed.
[318:21.74]But I like kind of, I understand the core entire concept of every zone.
[318:26.25]So it's easy to
[318:29.00]Yeah, and World of Warcraft really is, it's all about just being aware of your surroundings.
[318:33.86]There's two buttons.
[318:34.98]Most classes have two or three buttons.
[318:37.14]The game is not necessarily difficult to play.
[318:40.33]It's difficult to be in the right spot at the right time, which is really all that matters.
[318:43.87]You can get the add-on that, um, the guide add-on.
[318:50.85]Oh yeah, follow the arrow.
[318:52.57]Yeah, Poke was telling me about it.
[318:56.76]I'm doing cool now.
[318:57.99]I'm good just to kind of slug through this for a little while.
[319:03.07]If I die, I'm dead, and that's scary.
[319:06.53]So, I could, if I die on this character, I could just call up somebody from the minor leagues.
[319:15.46]I do have a couple of other characters that I could replace this one with, but we don't want to see Chaos Chris die.
[319:20.26]Okay.
[319:25.51]Bro is reading three different chats.
[319:27.67]I kind of am.
[319:31.24]Would you have died without the entourage?
[319:37.54]No, I don't think so.
[319:39.32]I would have been a lot more careful.
[319:44.29]We kind of want to see Chaos Chris die.
[319:47.47]Well, now that gives me more motivation to make sure that doesn't happen.
[319:50.97]Remember, the more of you that come in here waiting for me to do 07 to watch me die, that means I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen.
[319:57.66]You're going to get a personal attachment to the character?
[320:08.35]No, no.
[320:10.85]Every character I make in Hardcore, I give them a backstory where I don't give a shit about them.
[320:16.48]So, like, do we really care if Chaos Chris is dead?
[320:21.26]Not really.
[320:26.68]Now, would it be sick if Chaos Chris made it all the way?
[320:29.51]Oh, you better believe it, but, like, eh.
[320:31.95]It's Chaos Chris.
[320:32.83]Whatever.
[320:39.67]I shit you not, my main warlock on Retail WoW is Evil Chris.
[320:50.89]That's a great name.
[320:52.39]I love it.
[320:57.33]Chaos Chris needs to live so he can make it to the Jerva Rumble 50th anniversary.
[321:06.86]We need Lawful Good Chris.
[321:12.24]Can you get rezzed by a healer in hardcore?
[321:14.22]No, you cannot.
[321:17.06]If my health goes to zero...
[321:20.10]And I don't have like a cheat death or... Oh, I know, I'm coming.
[321:23.66]If I don't have cheat death or something on, then you're gone.
[321:25.75]Your character's gone.
[321:26.61]And the only way you can get it back is if you transfer to a different realm that's not hardcore.
[321:31.81]Alright, give me a few minutes.
[321:32.99]I might be a little bit... I might be more than like three or four minutes.
[321:36.57]So grab a snack if you would like, because you might have to use dog poop.
[321:44.16]I said that very weirdly, but you know what I mean.
[321:48.66]Did you poop yet?
[321:49.66]Maybe you didn't even poop yet today or whatever.
[321:51.48]Let's go find out.
[321:54.28]Alright, I'll be back.
[321:56.91]Ads are going to play.
[322:03.37]But they're not going to play for a minute.
[322:04.80]Yeah, it might take a couple minutes.
[322:07.10]Okay, let's go.
[322:07.54]Alright, I'll be back.
[322:09.62]Ads are going to play.
[322:10.54]I'll see you guys in like five minutes.
[322:12.98]See you soon.
[328:33.37]Alright, I'm back.
[328:35.13]Somebody said they just got more ads right now.
[328:37.85]You shouldn't be getting any more.
[328:44.66]Not as of right now or like a minute ago.
[328:53.46]I crocheted your logo in my art class.
[328:58.54]That's pretty, that's pretty sick.
[329:08.81]You should play Astro Bot.
[329:12.55]Maybe.
[329:17.14]Add it to the list of things that I say I'm going to do and just don't do.
[329:26.58]Okay, I am ready to go and I'm ready to lock in.
[329:29.50]I'm ready to go for it and get to level 10 so we can pick my spec, which is so important.
[329:39.10]Uh, this is level 13.
[329:41.94]But I think that's okay.
[329:43.96]Because there's 13 people here.
[329:46.32]That's one person per level.
[329:48.52]Um, I think we're going to be fine.
[329:55.62]I got, my bags are good.
[330:00.42]What about Devil May Cry?
[330:01.72]Devil May Cry was great.
[330:03.92]Um, I'm permanently traumatized with that whole franchise though.
[330:20.69]You want to come over here?
[330:22.17]Yeah, come here.
[330:24.39]He's doing the dachshund thing.
[330:25.67]He's doing the dog thing.
[330:27.95]He's like, um, no, I want to be there.
[330:30.21]Well, you can go right there.
[330:30.97]There you go.
[330:46.87]How far away is this?
[330:48.17]Uh, it's up where I just was.
[330:57.63]I understand your mascot looks like a Jerm and it's named Jerm and your Jerm is your name because it looks like a Jerm and then they wrote ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[331:05.95]You should play Poppy playtime.
[331:08.77]No.
[331:11.23]No, that I don't think so.
[331:18.84]Make your own guild so you can just be a cult leader.
[331:25.92]No.
[331:27.38]I'm not making, I'm not making and running a guild.
[331:30.30]That, nope.
[331:32.38]No thanks.
[331:36.35]Running a guild and putting a guild.
[331:37.67]Look out, watch out, watch out.
[331:41.03]Oh shit, there's a little 40 here.
[331:52.18]We joined my guild.
[331:53.20]No.
[331:53.58]No.
[331:58.20]Make a guild and just don't do anything with it.
[332:03.64]Just get somebody untrustworthy to manage it for you.
[332:10.61]No.
[332:14.01]I'm okay with participating in stuff.
[332:17.11]But I'm not having... I'm not doing that.
[332:29.49]Bro, how are you not level 10 yet?
[332:32.43]I died and had to start over an hour ago.
[332:35.89]So it's crazy that I've gotten to level 9 in one hour.
[332:38.05]Like I said, I was going to.
[332:40.43]So I'm happy about that at least.
[332:56.34]Too far away.
[333:06.92]You're moving around like a president.
[333:17.00]Like all these buffs.
[333:17.98]Somebody just gave me... What the hell?
[333:19.30]Is this a scroll?
[333:20.18]This is so... Oh, man.
[333:34.16]These are all the people that voted yes on the poll.
[333:38.68]Give him fucking every buff in the game.
[333:54.09]There's no nukes in DMC5.
[333:55.70]You'd love it.
[333:58.64]When I was asking which one to play, there was a big debate in the chat about it.
[334:05.04]If I should start with 5 or not.
[334:12.96]A lot of people said to start with five.
[334:15.36]Because the older ones are good, but they're kind of annoying and a little crusty sometimes.
[334:20.20]And drop bombs that blow your ears out?
[334:25.73]Didn't... That was a difficult part of that game.
[334:27.51]That was really hard.
[334:29.57]Hard game.
[334:30.11]Oh, we got aggro.
[334:43.85]The orb system is punishing.
[334:46.11]I did a few pretty good combos in that game, but I could say it was very, very difficult.
[334:54.26]Alright, stuff's going to become like level 13, 14 here.
[334:55.64]I know there's level 40 with us.
[334:58.04]And by the way, this level 40 has got the whirlwind axe.
[335:07.33]This thing is disgusting.
[335:09.63]It's very, very good.
[335:11.87]Damn, look at you.
[335:14.49]Damn.
[335:14.89]Okay.
[335:15.67]Alright.
[335:15.99]Get some good shit on.
[335:28.98]Oh, there's a level 60 here.
[335:35.97]Okay.
[335:37.27]I'm not afraid anymore.
[335:40.16]I mean, I kind of am because even at level one of these guys could cast a crit and I could die in probably two or three hits.
[335:57.83]I love shadow burn.
[335:59.61]Can't wait to get that.
[336:00.27]I love that move.
[336:01.81]Although we will figure it out.
[336:03.25]I'm not, I don't care about playing demonology or affliction.
[336:08.64]What is the thing that would be cool to see somebody journey through the game?
[336:13.73]There's the meta stuff.
[336:14.63]That's fine.
[336:15.55]But what's like something that's just kind of a little out there?
[336:20.45]I think it is conflagrate, right?
[336:22.93]It's destruction, right?
[336:23.71]Destruction all the way down to conflag.
[336:27.15]Because once you go all the way down to conflag, you're kind of... Nobody does that, right?
[336:43.43]Flag destruction would be the most off meta.
[336:49.77]Yeah, I'll do that.
[336:51.06]That sounds fun.
[336:52.28]Can flag as PvP.
[336:58.78]Going into a dungeon with a PvP build.
[337:03.66]I'm gonna get, like, punched in the face.
[337:05.38]Do you hate Final Fantasy?
[337:12.19]No.
[337:12.37]What?
[337:25.70]That last one was an absolute banger.
[337:27.98]I loved it.
[337:29.98]Just a commitment to get through it.
[337:33.03]I just wasn't willing to give it the time capital.
[337:40.73]It's one of those games though where I can always one day just open it and play it.
[337:44.47]I don't think I'd stream it, but... Still always fun.
[337:53.58]The music was awesome too.
[338:10.40]Why am I not?
[338:11.02]How many more?
[338:11.36]Four more.
[338:33.30]Come on, big crit.
[338:34.40]That was 40 damage.
[338:38.74]That's the most damage I've done in one hit.
[338:48.37]What's an impression that you wish you could do perfectly?
[338:50.15]I don't know, Christopher Walken.
[338:52.39]I feel like that has a lot of legs.
[338:57.53]If you can do a good Christopher Walken, everybody loves you.
[339:01.13]It doesn't matter if it's really good.
[339:05.07]Now, if you do a bad Christopher Walken... Oh man, you, come on, yeek.
[339:11.47]Oh, was that, was that, that was Walken?
[339:15.07]That was Walken?
[339:19.16]You have to do it, you're gonna nail it.
[339:20.66]And if you don't, you can't nail it... Then, no.
[339:26.66]But I would love to be able to do it.
[339:28.48]But then, the problem is, when you do a really good Christopher Walken, you become the Christopher Walken impression guy.
[339:35.47]And that's kind of, you get kind of typecasted as the, hey, dude, walk it.
[339:39.95]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[339:40.71]Hey, my buddy can do a fucking sick walk and come over here, dude.
[339:44.49]And then you, well, hi, everybody.
[339:46.68]And you have to do the routine in front of everyone.
[339:48.70]And then everyone laughs.
[339:49.90]But you get a lot of comedy capital out of it.
[339:53.94]It's a massive amount of comedy capital.
[340:06.22]And then your friends of yours are still having to do voicemails for them.
[340:11.12]Oh, you've called Johnny.
[340:14.06]And he can't come to the phone.
[340:16.54]But if he could, he would pick up the phone.
[340:19.02]And then it's like, holy shit, here comes the beep.
[340:21.88]You get a lot of capital out of it.
[340:30.80]Now the one that I just did, I would say I wouldn't pay for that one.
[340:34.17]And I would be charging my friends.
[340:43.99]What are you O7-ing?
[340:45.45]There's like 10 of us.
[340:46.45]We're fine.
[340:47.43]That was one level 10 enemy.
[340:48.98]You know, we're O7 in the chat.
[340:50.82]No.
[340:51.12]I almost died?
[340:54.90]No, I didn't.
[340:59.60]Did I?
[340:59.94]O7.
[341:00.44]We got... There's like two level 60s here.
[341:06.57]I guess I'd be careful.
[341:08.03]I've got bodyguards.
[341:09.25]If I'm talking to my bodyguards that way...
[341:12.42]Maybe they might just let me die.
[341:14.00]And then Chaos Chris gets flushed down the fucking toilet.
[341:36.33]Oh my god.
[341:36.97]Okay, I need mana.
[341:40.39]You're gonna die before you reach level 10?
[341:42.93]Well, that would be very sad considering I'm there in two seconds.
[341:45.79]You're gonna be dead by level 15?
[341:50.89]Okay.
[341:52.83]Shit.
[341:54.03]I'm gonna be fine.
[342:08.44]You see that global cooldown beat?
[342:17.28]Yeah, the really scary part of this game is Scarlet Monastery.
[342:22.25]Anything over level 25, 30.
[342:27.45]That's when it gets to be really, really terrifying.
[342:30.77]I have these.
[342:40.73]Is there a boss up here that I have to kill?
[342:42.05]Nope.
[342:52.48]Ah, it's in the crypt, too.
[342:54.76]Am I going to finish Boneworks?
[343:00.23]Uh, no, I'm not.
[343:03.29]It's always fun and I know I'm painting you in a light that you might not be.
[343:10.01]But I feel like you just finished that VOD.
[343:12.86]Like on the archive channel.
[343:16.60]And you got disappointed.
[343:17.64]And this is by the way, this is like four years ago.
[343:20.40]You probably just finished the VOD and you realized that I said in that VOD that, oh no, it was okay, it was fun.
[343:29.57]Maybe I'll go back to that at one point.
[343:32.62]Yeah, that was a little while ago.
[343:41.12]We're going in the crypt.
[343:42.51]07.
[343:46.19]Who's the famous one here?
[343:47.99]Can we just pretend it's somebody else?
[343:49.31]Okay.
[343:49.45]Okay.
[344:06.62]Careful.
[344:08.26]Careful.
[344:08.54]Wait, can we pull this like a whole... Is there anything else down here?
[344:10.64]I didn't want to do that.
[344:21.22]Easy, easy.
[344:21.95]Watch it.
[344:22.41]What?
[344:25.85]Okay, I'm fucking out of here.
[344:27.99]They pulled the fucking whole crypt.
[344:29.55]They pulled the whole crypt.
[344:31.41]Even if there's a level 40 here, it doesn't matter.
[344:33.53]I can kill you in two hits.
[344:37.92]Not too many of us, too many people going down into the crypt.
[344:43.44]Should I get layered here?
[344:44.24]I feel like this is very dangerous.
[344:47.77]Or maybe this is exactly what the doctor ordered.
[345:05.03]I'm going to stay in the group.
[345:07.22]Call me a coward all you want, whatever.
[345:09.76]I'm not going to be able to get a necessary.
[345:11.36]Oh my God, we're good.
[345:18.26]Is a boss in here?
[345:19.14]No, is there?
[345:33.41]Okay, so they're all dead.
[345:34.69]Yeah, I'm done here.
[345:37.09]I'm getting out of here.
[345:38.39]Boss is a skull elite.
[345:39.96]Yep.
[345:40.34]See you later.
[345:40.72]Yeah, I would get out of there.
[345:45.68]I don't know if even half of you care if your character dies, right?
[345:48.86]But I would get the hell out of there right now.
[345:55.39]Is it hardcore?
[345:55.89]This is hardcore.
[345:56.59]Yep.
[346:00.29]So... Wait.
[346:02.13]Wait.
[346:05.09]Do I have to go in there?
[346:06.31]Wait.
[346:07.84]Is that what it is?
[346:12.78]Is it our goal?
[346:14.10]Is that the person we need to kill?
[346:15.16]The boss is level 17.
[346:17.05]Oh.
[346:26.38]it's not an elite alright let's go look if I'm gonna have this many people here we may as well just like just rush in here and just go all the way down I'm raiding the agamond family crypt so it's fine
[347:03.27]The only reason why this many people would be down here is if there was a Pokémon Go event in the crypt down here.
[347:08.90]This is what everybody's here for.
[347:10.88]No other reason why this many people would be here.
[347:14.91]There's like a Charmander down here.
[347:27.71]Oh my god!
[347:31.18]No, I didn't even get credit for it.
[347:37.04]Well, everyone said it was 17, so when I threw the spell, I was like, oh shit, wait a minute.
[347:43.04]I could die in one hit.
[347:52.34]Oh wait, who is not here for the stream?
[347:56.68]I want to invite that person to a party.
[348:02.80]So they can get this done.
[348:05.12]Is this person here?
[348:05.92]Oh, I can't.
[348:16.08]I can't do it.
[348:22.87]Let this person get it.
[348:23.71]Yeah, let this person get it.
[348:44.08]What was that?
[348:44.52]Target dummy?
[348:45.18]Oh.
[348:54.26]I'm going to share this.
[348:55.20]I thought he was like quest.
[348:56.22]Yeah, and don't.
[349:03.26]Oh, don't troll either.
[349:04.37]Don't.
[349:04.77]Oh, OK, there we go.
[349:05.93]Am I going to get credit for this?
[349:08.63]Hey, I'm going to get credit for it.
[349:09.65]Perfect.
[349:16.54]That's nice of them.
[349:17.10]Thank you.
[349:19.77]Yeah, we don't want to come up and blow up... blow up somebody's spot here, you know?
[349:32.23]Did anybody get the Jarmander?
[349:41.31]Alright, I gotta get out of the party.
[349:50.10]I'm getting out of here.
[349:50.96]I think that's it and then going to the coast.
[350:12.53]You could be playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure instead.
[350:15.95]That's true, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you want to or will do something.
[350:29.88]My favorite instance, well, my favorite raid is Karazhan.
[350:33.56]I've never done it, but I've watched entire playthroughs of it.
[350:38.51]I just think it's very unique.
[350:39.59]I think it's like the most fun and interesting of them all.
[350:46.96]It just seems like a giant amusement park.
[350:50.60]Yeah, I never did it.
[350:51.60]No.
[350:51.96]Yeah, I played during TPC.
[350:55.46]I was very active during the original TPC launch.
[351:08.49]How come we're not getting any of that classic gamer rage of yours?
[351:14.23]Um...
[351:16.49]I'm kind of just hanging out.
[351:24.93]I'm going to hug here.
[351:27.18]I don't want to get complacent because the second that all the... Because let's face it, after like level 10, 20, this is going to be thinned out a lot.
[351:42.99]That was the first raid in TBC.
[351:44.53]I didn't really do very much TBC raiding at all.
[351:48.13]I didn't really raid that much at all.
[351:49.56]Period.
[351:50.24]Honestly.
[351:52.72]I did a lot of heroics when they eventually came out.
[351:55.58]But those were sometimes even harder than some of the raids.
[352:01.04]I just did it to get 40 people, 20 people.
[352:02.74]It was always... I never really was in like a raiding guild.
[352:11.30]I jumped around from time to time to different guilds and stuff.
[352:13.64]Just like, oh, I guess I'll just join this one.
[352:17.68]But back then, it was kind of hard to do raids and get that many people to kind of show up at the same time.
[352:26.33]And it was managing a lot of people, especially if half the people didn't even want to use any... Okay, hold on.
[352:33.80]This could kill people here.
[352:35.02]Is this stupid?
[352:36.40]Where even is this?
[352:52.18]Yeah, there is bad fall damage and it kills you pretty quickly.
[352:55.27]Okay, yeah, it's right here.
[353:02.79]Would you play if there were new TBC Classic servers?
[353:06.24]Absolutely.
[353:08.79]My favorite state the game was ever in was in that TBC into Wrath period.
[353:13.71]It just was.
[353:15.27]I loved all the talent tree.
[353:16.69]Because back... There are builds in this game that are total fucking dog shit.
[353:22.45]Entire swaths of characters that just should... It's just that we're not good at all.
[353:29.02]Each... I want to say like probably three or four classes in this game have one totally, completely useless spec.
[353:35.69]In TBC and into Wrath, every single tree felt like it was fun to play.
[353:40.93]Or at least you could do it if you wanted to.
[353:42.99]At least that's how it felt.
[353:48.65]So there was more options.
[353:50.05]There were more ways to play it, I guess.
[353:53.81]This is... Where are we?
[353:56.75]Yeah, we're kind of in the middle of nowhere here.
[354:03.72]I'm about to be level 10.
[354:05.38]So finally.
[354:06.08]It only took us six hours.
[354:15.15]But I say I was going to get there in an hour or two.
[354:18.05]It's alright.
[354:23.65]What was that?
[354:26.00]A staff that was a piece of a lobster.
[354:33.20]How did you find out you had ADHD?
[354:36.24]Uh, I got F's in every class.
[354:42.21]That's how.
[354:50.55]And that, that was about, that went on for about, uh, I want to say like one or two report cards before I turned it around.
[354:58.88]It was like, okay, this, I gotta get this figured out here.
[355:22.37]This guy was a teacher.
[355:23.99]No, I was not.
[355:25.59]I was not a teacher.
[355:31.19]I did substitute... I did sub-tute work.
[355:36.61]For like one... Maybe like one or two years.
[355:40.71]Total.
[355:41.41]Ever.
[355:51.87]Everybody thought I wasn't going to make it.
[355:53.97]And we proved... Everybody stand here, please.
[355:57.15]Get over here now.
[355:58.71]Stand next to me.
[356:00.21]Everybody stand next to me.
[356:13.22]They all thought I wasn't gonna make it.
[356:14.30]Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, I gotta...
[356:48.26]Well, as you can see, currently made it to level... I almost said 60.
[356:52.87]Hold on, start over.
[356:57.73]How do I... I made it to level 60.
[357:06.65]Thanks, everybody.
[357:07.29]Everybody clap.
[357:08.69]Everybody do slash clap.
[357:15.60]That's... Okay, that felt... That was very lame.
[357:18.97]I hated that.
[357:19.61]I hated every second of that.
[357:20.91]I was so enthusiastic.
[357:37.63]I gotta... My wand has to keep leveling up.
[357:39.43]I forgot about that.
[357:40.11]What is it at right now?
[357:43.82]Okay, I need five more points.
[357:45.94]Yeah, every time you attack with a new weapon, that's the one thing about Classic that is kind of painful.
[357:53.11]Is if you go the whole time playing with, for instance, like a dagger or a sword and you want to use a mace and you haven't used a mace before, you have to level up your skill with that weapon or you can't hurt anything.
[358:08.40]And if you do that at level 60, you have to do that up to level 300 and it sucks.
[358:17.65]I'm glad it's in the game, though, because it actually, I don't know, it feels like the weapons have more of a weight to them.
[358:24.32]It's more kind of oomph to using a mace.
[358:27.52]It's like, okay, well, you have to actually use it.
[358:32.90]Alright, I got a talent point.
[358:34.74]I'm ready to spend it.
[358:38.09]Here we go.
[358:39.51]Alright, what do I want to do?
[358:40.69]Because it's expensive to respec, and I don't have enough money to do dualspec.
[358:46.19]So it's either all the way down destruction to here.
[358:49.79]It's a lot of fire.
[358:53.05]What most people do is they get to here.
[358:55.98]Because this is probably the most important warlock talent that there is.
[359:02.68]I think this is a must get in every meta build, right?
[359:06.32]Every single one.
[359:09.60]I mean, that's insane.
[359:13.78]Do demo spec for leveling?
[359:23.54]Ooh, we can make the imp better.
[359:25.88]Affliction is the most fun.
[359:26.94]I agree with you.
[359:30.42]But I feel like Affliction you need to pay the most attention to.
[359:40.86]This is just good.
[359:42.60]I mean, I know I'm going to at least get a few points here anyways.
[359:46.33]Or this one as well.
[359:50.38]You have an entourage of goons.
[359:52.06]You can play whatever you want.
[359:53.10]That's also true.
[359:53.98]But this is probably the first thing to get.
[359:57.52]Your shadow bolt crits.
[359:59.76]Increase shadow damage dealt to the target by 4% until 4 non... That's non-dot damage sources are applied.
[360:07.45]So essentially, I would do 5% more damage if I crit with a shadow bolt.
[360:12.59]We're going this way.
[360:13.31]I'm going destruction.
[360:14.03]I'm going all the way.
[360:19.07]So this is going to have five points in it.
[360:21.69]It's just fine.
[360:22.25]It's pretty good.
[360:33.16]I need, uh, okay, we'll come out on the coast over here.
[360:36.18]See if we can get a crit.
[360:40.81]I want to see it.
[360:47.38]Do you want to crit so everyone can see my cool new talent point?
[360:52.02]Game sucks.
[361:03.11]Oh shit, people are dead here.
[361:04.41]Those are that is a corpse that is a fresh corpse.
[361:09.51]That person is dead forever.
[361:22.98]Alright, that's it.
[361:24.38]I'm out of here.
[361:25.16]Although, let's kill this stuff.
[361:34.66]Uh-oh.
[361:37.70]I just see lightning bolts going everywhere.
[361:39.59]I don't know whose they are.
[361:49.65]Eat that player corpse.
[361:51.43]Alright.
[361:53.49]Uh, okay, this, we gotta be careful here.
[361:57.96]Time to pull everything and let him mob tag.
[362:03.48]He really did pull everything.
[362:10.69]Oh, my wand.
[362:11.15]I gotta get my wand up.
[362:14.17]That guy just punched me in the face.
[362:22.59]Are you going to join Only Fangs or are you just playing for fun?
[362:26.13]I need to... I need to make sure that I want to do this, which I think I do.
[362:37.52]At least very casually.
[362:40.14]Exactly kind of what you're seeing here.
[362:43.20]Well, doing dungeons, I mean, I would definitely do dungeons with people if they wanted to.
[362:47.64]I know Metallix.
[362:49.50]Metallix is in Only Fangs.
[362:55.70]No, maybe, maybe I would, if I felt like if they would have me and I want to, maybe.
[363:11.76]It's solo guild found.
[363:13.08]Yeah, that's another thing too that I would have to.
[363:16.90]I'm like, I took like 20 copper from somebody in like a bag that they shit in.
[363:23.92]You know what I mean?
[363:24.34]Like somebody shit in a bag and handed it to me.
[363:25.62]I don't know if that the counselor, I don't know.
[363:30.72]Effectively, I would have to.
[363:32.20]I wouldn't be able to do very much outside of only fangs in regards to like trade.
[363:37.06]Alright, what's going on here?
[363:45.50]This is kill scarlet warriors.
[363:49.04]And then all the pumpkins, that's right.
[364:03.81]This stuff is pretty low level.
[364:11.31]I made you a sweater.
[364:15.14]You can just continue on a PvE regular classic.
[364:17.14]It's a free transfer.
[364:20.26]Yeah, that's true.
[364:22.20]I'm kind of just... I'm kind of just vibing.
[364:24.28]You know, I'm just having fun, hanging out.
[364:29.35]I think a lot of, if you're talking about Only Fangs, a lot of people that are in Only Fangs right now, people have been playing it for a couple months.
[364:37.17]So there's not a whole lot of, oh, I'm level 16 and I'm ready to go.
[364:43.19]I mean, some people have alts, but... I'm very low compared to most people that are in Only Fangs right now.
[365:07.75]T1 is 27.
[365:09.66]That's true, but T1 also played through the game a couple times, right?
[365:12.76]He was, I think he died once, right?
[365:16.54]And then he got to 60 and raided and did the raid leading.
[365:20.27]And so he did a lot already.
[365:28.23]Only Fangs also has strict rules against an entourage of goons.
[365:32.25]That's also true too.
[365:34.09]The second that I join Only Fangs, you all gotta go.
[365:39.37]If I were to do that.
[365:52.12]Mob tagging is okay now.
[365:53.08]They got rid of a lot of those rules.
[366:03.45]Join it now.
[366:04.19]Get him out of here.
[366:08.17]It's alright.
[366:09.59]That doesn't bother me right now.
[366:10.89]It's fine.
[366:12.65]Like 1 to 10, 1 to 15.
[366:14.31]That's fine.
[366:15.23]It's okay.
[366:16.69]I would say I definitely wouldn't want this at like level 30 because then I'm kind of not playing the game anymore.
[366:22.67]You know, like level like 15 to 20, I would be not really playing anymore.
[366:27.76]I'd be watching a World of Warcraft game.
[366:35.50]But these initial zones, they're... A lot of... Most of them are a sleepwalk anyway, so... Where are these warriors here?
[366:45.04]Scarlet warrior?
[366:45.79]There's nothing here.
[366:46.45]Uh-oh.
[366:46.87]Layer!
[366:47.27]Um... Yeah, somebody went to layer me.
[366:57.11]Feels like everything's dead here.
[366:59.26]Somebody just did it.
[367:05.71]Thank you.
[367:07.55]Tata for now.
[367:10.61]Are you playing in 720p?
[367:14.25]I think I'm playing at the highest rate.
[367:15.65]I think I'm playing at 2160p, whatever it is, 2100p.
[367:36.80]Anybody?
[367:37.74]Anything?
[367:41.16]I got some new gear, didn't I?
[367:45.12]No.
[367:46.38]Oh, I can eat these.
[367:49.94]So if you spend at least 10 seconds eating, it's three mana per five.
[367:52.24]That's good.
[367:53.40]But I got to remember these are on the bar.
[367:54.62]Yes.
[368:04.40]He's actually playing this and you do four dot dot dots.
[368:11.44]Yeah, I'm playing it.
[368:13.73]I'm afraid to go up here because I'm going to get spawned on.
[368:18.41]I think this place is very dangerous.
[368:20.13]Although I'm like... I think I'm fine.
[368:22.07]What level is this stuff?
[368:22.94]Sick.
[368:23.22]Oh my god.
[368:23.72]What am I?
[368:24.18]A coward?
[368:24.64]I'm fine.
[368:42.89]I'm going to pull you out, though.
[368:48.69]Careful.
[368:49.13]I'm going to kill 10 of these.
[369:08.92]Oh, I should drop group, too.
[369:09.84]Thanks for the layer.
[369:10.44]Appreciate it.
[369:11.52]Thank you.
[369:15.56]That's so nice of people.
[369:17.90]Oh, somebody dead.
[369:18.60]I have to kill somebody in here.
[369:25.60]Just this, just the Warriors and just pumpkins, OK?
[369:38.61]Yeah, we're just showing.
[369:52.50]I also gotta get the muscle memory for an actual rotation, which this bar is dog shit.
[369:57.53]I need to fix it.
[370:00.61]You should get death log.
[370:01.79]Yeah, if I really want to take this seriously and do it a lot.
[370:06.11]I'll get some of those add-ons, but I kind of want to go pretty vanilla.
[370:14.10]I hate when there's shit all over the screen.
[370:17.14]people that have the UIs where it's just like boxes and like timers and countdowns and, and when your pizza delivery is going to get here.
[370:24.82]And I, I know it just distracts the hell out of me.
[370:27.86]I just need to, I need a clear screen.
[370:49.94]These guys are very low level.
[370:50.94]This is not a problem.
[371:01.59]I'm getting a lot more experience.
[371:08.02]What's the wand at?
[371:09.90]Yeah, 48.
[371:17.38]You'd make a wicked Gojo cosplay.
[371:22.56]Gojo?
[371:25.44]From Fraggle Rock?
[371:43.11]That's a Gobo.
[371:44.99]Oh.
[371:46.05]Well, alright.
[371:46.71]Well, okay.
[371:51.20]Gojo from Jujutsu... From Jujutsu Kaisen.
[371:57.64]I thought you said... Is his name Gobo?
[372:07.19]Oh, you're talking about... Tuna.
[372:10.49]I can't even do it.
[372:13.30]Tuna.
[372:22.48]Yeah, Gobo is cool as hell.
[372:23.76]I would... That would be my Halloween costume.
[372:26.35]It would be Gobo from Fraggle Rock.
[372:30.69]Oh, shit.
[372:30.99]This guy's a rare spawn.
[372:32.59]Give me this right now.
[372:33.53]Is this guy going to kill me?
[372:34.25]I got to be careful.
[372:34.83]Alright.
[372:35.25]Do everything I can to not die.
[372:43.84]Farmer Saladin.
[372:44.76]Do I get something cool for this?
[372:46.22]I don't think I've ever seen this guy.
[372:50.08]I got his pants...
[372:53.60]I don't want this guy's pants.
[373:04.54]My tie is on way too tight.
[373:05.84]I can barely breathe.
[373:15.03]I mean, they're cool looking though.
[373:16.05]Those are blue.
[373:16.57]I actually kind of like it.
[373:17.43]That looks actually kind of.
[373:20.99]I look like a butler.
[373:31.81]I got the rare spawn.
[373:44.13]Do you also think the things in the dozers made Fraggle Rock look delicious?
[373:47.43]Oh, you're talking about the little crystal strands, the little crystal things?
[373:52.56]Yeah.
[373:54.76]Biggest mistake they ever made was not boxing that and sell like making a candy that looked just like it and selling it.
[374:03.36]Very crispy light like ribbon candy, but not as hard.
[374:07.80]That's what I would want.
[374:19.05]I need some more of these farmers.
[374:31.48]Where are the farmers?
[374:34.02]Where are the farmers?
[374:38.00]Uh, I'm not going to take that because I might... I might get layered into death.
[374:47.51]What Muppet could you take in a fistfight?
[374:49.27]All of them.
[374:50.68]Except, uh, what's it called?
[374:52.62]Sweetums.
[374:54.08]Oh, no, where are you going?
[374:55.46]No, wait for me!
[374:56.48]That guy.
[374:57.78]Oh, I want to go to Hollywood!
[375:00.05]That guy would kick the shit out of you.
[375:09.28]Oh, Miss Piggy would kick the shit out of me too.
[375:11.16]There's no way.
[375:14.28]One hi-ya directly into the sternum, I wouldn't be able to breathe.
[375:18.20]Yeah, she'd beat the shit out of me.
[375:28.83]And Miss Piggy is also the only one that has combat training.
[375:33.31]So I would put Miss Piggy at probably S tier for who you would lose in a fight to for the Muppets.
[375:39.64]I think we're done.
[375:48.00]I think we're done done actually with almost the whole zone besides this.
[375:50.91]Cool.
[375:52.47]Cool.
[376:05.39]You seem like you were a leash kid.
[376:07.41]What does that mean?
[376:14.87]What a leash kid.
[376:15.95]No, I know.
[376:31.93]I love the imp because when you shoot at the same time, you do the double shot.
[376:34.99]I love it.
[376:36.73]That orange and purple going together.
[376:38.81]I like imp in Fel Hunter.
[376:42.13]Those are my two favorites.
[376:43.51]Voidwalker is so good for utility and it's just kind of best in slot no matter what all the way through like level 50.
[376:57.08]You probably had SpaghettiOs on your face all the time.
[376:59.22]No, I didn't.
[376:59.66]I was a very clean kid.
[377:02.40]I was really clean.
[377:03.52]I was pretty well behaved.
[377:06.00]I just liked to talk.
[377:08.70]He just kind of couldn't shut me up.
[377:09.76]That was really all there was to it.
[377:14.72]I was pretty well behaved.
[377:19.80]Careful out there.
[377:26.60]I can learn new spells too.
[377:27.78]How much money do I got?
[377:28.52]I got 25 silver.
[377:29.78]That's a lot.
[377:33.33]I bet you pretended to puke orange juice on the floor in front of your grandmother.
[377:35.99]Yeah, I did.
[377:37.03]And I was like, yeah, I was trying to... I didn't want to go to school.
[377:46.29]Yeah, there was that one time when I was younger.
[377:47.92]I don't know what it was.
[377:50.74]I just was like, I don't really don't want to go to school today.
[377:52.62]So I put... I put orange juice in my mouth and I went up to my grandmother and I was like...
[378:03.70]like very clearly I'm not talking and there's something in my mouth and I went down onto the ground and I went I went flat on my stomach because I guess that was to prove how how sick I was I laid flat down with my face facing the floor flat and did one fist down on the left and one fist down on the right like oh here oh no and I went blah and I spit it out
[378:34.47]And my grandmother literally just said, go to school.
[378:40.81]And I did.
[378:58.57]Yeah, I really thought I... My acting got a little better, though, over the years, I think.
[379:17.36]Was that in the 80s?
[379:17.98]That was in the very early 90s.
[379:22.06]That had to have been 1993, 1994.
[379:28.20]I was in at least the first grade.
[379:29.36]I was probably like the second or third grade or something at that point, maybe.
[379:32.10]Alright, big turn in here and then we're leaving.
[379:44.18]I could just go down to Silver Pine, couldn't I?
[379:57.19]So this stuff is very important.
[380:01.23]This will save your life in hardcore.
[380:07.94]Also, there's the like the glue, right?
[380:11.04]The glue is so good too, but I don't know.
[380:12.70]Where do you get that?
[380:14.26]Is that in Durotar?
[380:20.74]It's very good.
[380:22.86]It's a great way to run away and get out of trouble.
[380:26.27]Ooh.
[380:28.70]I might not do these quests.
[380:29.90]I don't know.
[380:30.22]Should I be a completionist Andy?
[380:32.56]Almost level 11.
[380:41.99]Come on.
[380:48.81]You need the XP.
[380:50.57]What is Silver Pine?
[380:51.41]Silver Pine is like 15 to 20, isn't it?
[380:54.17]Or like 12, 15.
[380:55.63]12 to 15.
[380:56.05]Yeah, if you don't know, Silver Pine has a couple of elites that roam around randomly.
[381:03.56]I think they're level 30.
[381:04.18]If you see one...
[381:08.50]It's too late.
[381:09.72]Right?
[381:09.94]Like, if you see it, if it's in your peripheral or if you aggro this thing, it's too late.
[381:15.45]You're going to die.
[381:17.25]So, we gotta be very careful here.
[381:19.25]If I'm going down to Silverpine, I did say I would never come to this piece of shit, fucked up zone ever again for the rest of my life.
[381:25.53]But we're on stream now.
[381:27.09]So, I'll try.
[381:30.16]Okay.
[381:42.54]Ooh.
[381:44.92]Uh, yeah.
[381:45.92]What do you learn, Staffs?
[381:48.64]Remember, stamina is health.
[381:51.82]That's a pretty big deal.
[381:55.97]You're gonna go for 24 hours?
[381:57.99]No, no, I'm... No.
[382:01.75]I'm having fun, and trust me, I'm doing just fine, but... I'm addicted to the game, though.
[382:09.79]I'm addicted.
[382:11.03]I'm addicted to the game.
[382:16.71]Where was it?
[382:17.65]Is it Orgrimmar?
[382:18.11]You could go to the Barrens too.
[382:22.93]Yeah, I could also go to the Barrens.
[382:24.10]I've done the Barrens like three times.
[382:27.90]Three times was enough for me, but you got to do it as Horde.
[382:33.55]I've never really made Horde characters, ever.
[382:36.49]Even back when I first played, I was always Alliance.
[382:38.27]My first character ever was Horde.
[382:40.91]It was a troll warrior, I believe.
[382:45.75]The first character, I think I got him to, like, level 20, and then I changed to Alliance.
[382:51.05]And I kind of never, ever went back.
[382:54.64]There was, like, maybe one or two other characters I made a long time ago that, like, maybe a few times that I got to, like, through the Barrens, or... That was kind of it.
[383:06.04]I'm going to figure out what I want to do.
[383:08.12]We're either still going or... I'm good.
[383:11.40]I'm good to continue.
[383:14.29]I'll take a break.
[383:16.07]Stretch a little.
[383:17.55]But I do want to learn.
[383:19.65]Yeah, this is going to send me to the Undercity.
[383:21.05]This is for the... Yeah, this is for the Voidwalker, I think.
[383:25.90]You get Voidwalker at level 10, right?
[383:29.90]There we go.
[383:30.30]Drain Soul.
[383:33.63]Rank 2 immolate, that's good.
[383:37.45]What is it?
[383:38.39]19 and then 40 over time?
[383:39.43]Oh, that's huge.
[383:40.67]Yeah, get that.
[383:44.25]Drain Soul.
[383:44.73]Alright, so Drain, if you don't know Drain Soul, is if the enemy gives you experience, if it's within your level range, while you're doing it, it does damage.
[383:54.65]And if they die, you get a consumable that you then need to use for certain abilities.
[384:03.18]And then, oh, Hellstone is so huge too.
[384:05.39]And another Rank of Demons skin.
[384:06.51]Alright.
[384:09.63]I'll come back and I'll figure that out.
[384:13.23]In the meantime, I'll be back.
[384:14.09]It'll be a few minutes.
[384:17.32]Grab a snack or something.
[384:18.52]Get up and stretch.
[384:20.00]See you in a few.
[384:23.32]Oh, ads are going to... Let me make sure I put that on here.
[384:30.39]There we go.
[384:30.67]Alright.
[384:31.67]See you in a few.
[384:55.00]do
[386:18.70]Thank you.
[387:37.45]you
[388:06.52]I think we're back.
[388:07.14]What's up?
[388:08.88]Okay, so it's kind of a long one today.
[388:31.61]World of stoner craft.
[388:38.50]Let me see what's in the mail.
[388:40.02]A lot of shit.
[388:43.58]I can take this because it's a t-shirt.
[388:48.82]Oh, I can't take this.
[388:49.57]Never mind.
[388:56.81]Did you take a hit of helium?
[388:58.89]Oh, do you have the bug that does that?
[389:05.31]Remind me not to sell those trousers.
[389:09.83]Because that's kind of a unique item, isn't it?
[389:13.37]Is that better?
[389:25.64]Oh, shit, it is.
[389:34.41]This is a unique item too, but meh.
[389:38.27]Sells for a lot.
[389:41.81]I need to make a shitload.
[389:43.17]Yeah, we're going to do bandages for a minute.
[389:48.13]And then... Wait, is it heavy bandage?
[389:50.89]I can get heavy linen bandage now, can't I?
[389:54.65]I definitely can.
[389:57.35]Somebody teach it here?
[390:01.64]There is a first aid trainer.
[390:02.44]Where are you?
[390:06.01]We're here.
[390:16.04]I am forsaken.
[390:19.08]Heavy linen bandages level 40.
[390:20.44]What am I?
[390:22.59]Okay, 38.
[390:24.29]Two times.
[390:27.25]Dermot's going to host a raid in only fangs.
[390:29.77]No, no, no.
[390:30.77]That would not happen ever.
[390:34.86]That is a 0.0% chance of that happening.
[390:39.22]Everyone in that raid would die.
[390:42.16]Everyone.
[390:43.20]If I would ever do something like that, everyone would die.
[390:47.28]No one would get out of there alive.
[390:57.15]And that's like, that's like funny.
[390:59.72]But like when you kill 40 fucking level 60s because I like backed up and like pulled fucking eight mobs.
[391:10.28]No.
[391:19.43]I'm so scared of killing people in a dungeon.
[391:22.25]Trust me when I say if there's a case where there would be like danger.
[391:29.24]I don't know what the fuck I would do.
[391:32.76]I would probably try to sacrifice myself.
[391:36.08]I would just throw myself just to death.
[391:39.04]Because every alternative I don't like.
[391:52.69]You would roach.
[391:55.11]No, I don't think I would.
[391:57.27]I think I would consider roaching and then hear all the people talking about how I roached and I'd be like, no, I didn't.
[392:02.94]Watch.
[392:03.66]And then I would just like get cleaved and die.
[392:07.50]That's very likely to be the outcome.
[392:16.05]Look out.
[392:16.41]Watch out.
[392:17.83]He's going to be sick.
[392:20.35]Oh, he just puked on the ground.
[392:23.06]Orange juice, dude, really?
[392:25.30]Go to school.
[392:27.72]You're fine.
[392:33.90]What can you do?
[392:34.56]What is roaching?
[392:36.92]Uh, in the easiest terms I can describe, let's say that the eight of us are down here and there's a very, very scary monster here and he's like level 20 and we're all scared of him.
[392:48.55]Uh, we start fighting the level 20 monster together and it takes 20 people to do it.
[392:53.51]All of a sudden, three people in a patrol that are also very high level 20s.
[392:58.31]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[393:01.86]And what roaching is, is this.
[393:03.80]When that happens... That's what it is.
[393:21.37]It means, it means just running away and like saving yourself, yeah.
[393:24.91]And getting the fuck out of there.
[393:25.97]And not, and like potentially not even helping.
[393:29.01]Now...
[393:31.18]That's a viable strategy sometimes.
[393:33.69]So, you know what?
[393:34.13]Sometimes shit has hit the fan so bad that it's like, hey, it's, we're all fucked.
[393:39.67]Just run.
[393:40.49]Like, it doesn't matter.
[393:41.15]Like, you're gonna die.
[393:42.81]You're gonna, we're all gonna die.
[393:44.46]Maybe one of us will get out.
[393:52.29]I think, like, the way that that works is that you make that call.
[393:55.07]You just go, like, everybody bug out.
[393:57.79]Like, bug the fuck out.
[393:59.01]And that's when it's like, alright, I'm gone.
[394:00.81]I'm doing anything possible to get the fuck out of this dungeon or whatever.
[394:04.61]I would call for, like, bug out is what I would say.
[394:07.41]Like, everybody roach.
[394:08.39]I would just scream it.
[394:09.42]But then what if, like, people don't want to listen to you?
[394:15.84]You can't be like, everybody, let's fucking roach.
[394:18.64]And there's, like, two people still has aggro and, like, we could probably do it.
[394:24.05]That's why I am never, I am going to be, I'm never going to call anything.
[394:28.44]If I'm ever in a dungeon, it's going to be somebody else is going to say something and I'm going to do it.
[394:34.46]If I'm in an instance and somebody says, hey, oh, Jerma, you got to jump off that ledge.
[394:38.89]Yep.
[394:39.21]We just pulled two mobs.
[394:40.15]You jump off that ledge and you have to die.
[394:41.55]I'd be like, oh, okay.
[394:42.65]Does that help?
[394:53.15]Definitely a follower.
[394:54.43]That's a lemming mentality.
[395:00.79]But I also don't want, I don't want like a fucking threat about me of like, Jermall wipes the raid and it's, it's like a screencap of me, like with my mouth open, like, oh no.
[395:22.12]want to go through that man I'd rather just sacrifice myself than go through that sus guy kills entire guild yeah I I don't want to be a headline
[395:45.34]I mean, it's okay.
[395:46.36]I don't care about being a headline if it's not like, oh, hey, um, thanks a lot, man.
[395:51.43]Uh, thanks a lot.
[395:53.43]You ruined everything.
[395:56.05]What do you mean?
[395:56.81]You ruined everything.
[395:57.59]Like, literally, like, that was 40s, 60s.
[395:59.71]And, like, it was all, like, look at all these people that you killed.
[396:01.87]Look at all these streamers.
[396:04.39]Um.
[396:07.35]Look at me.
[396:07.85]Ha ha ha.
[396:11.21]Okay, what do I want to do?
[396:12.33]I think I'm going to go to the under city because I want to get Voidwalker because Voidwalker is very important.
[396:30.44]Let's all get killed by the son of Aragog.
[396:32.44]You guys have good.
[396:33.46]You guys can do that if you want.
[396:34.80]I'm not doing that.
[396:36.38]Why can I not close this?
[396:45.05]I think this is bugged out.
[396:46.95]Oh, now I can.
[396:47.71]What the fuck just happened?
[396:50.25]I couldn't do that before.
[396:50.97]That was weird.
[396:55.23]Alright, there's a lot of people here.
[396:57.09]How many people died at the elevator?
[396:58.26]Because there's like 10 people.
[397:20.47]Is Jerma playing with viewers?
[397:22.91]Um, I think the viewers are playing with me.
[397:25.81]I think that's what's going on.
[397:36.19]I'm along for the ride at this point here.
[397:47.22]Alright, I'm not... There's too many people trying to go in at the same time.
[397:50.96]One of you is dead.
[397:52.94]I'm fucking roaching out of here the second that elevator shows up.
[398:03.18]Way too many people.
[398:16.23]Alright, that guy almost didn't make it.
[398:25.11]Okay.
[398:25.87]Everyone's good.
[398:26.53]Good.
[398:26.71]Dude, you're gonna die from the elevator and never play this again.
[398:33.41]I mean, that would be a fun way to go out and not play this anymore.
[398:36.00]Goddamn.
[398:53.94]This guy is going to murder the whole guild.
[398:58.78]Well, I'm not in a guild, so that's alright.
[399:08.66]Well, level 10, almost 11.
[399:11.26]I'm very, very slowly going through this.
[399:16.15]Well, but here's the thing.
[399:17.07]For the first two to three hours of the stream, I forgot that being in a full group of five at level one in the starting zone is the dumbest thing you could ever do.
[399:26.88]And instead of killing 10 mobs and getting to level five, it took a long time.
[399:48.87]We're good though, I'm doing good.
[399:55.30]You're not gonna use the guide?
[399:56.18]Nah, I'm good.
[399:57.54]I know a lot about where things are.
[400:01.70]You know what's really, really sad?
[400:05.26]I probably could do, up until retail, every zone where it is.
[400:11.40]If you gave me an outline of, like, a square, I could put them all there without a single problem.
[400:17.01]I don't think I could do that with Europe.
[400:21.21]In fact, I'm guaranteeing I couldn't do that with Europe.
[400:23.01]Okay, bring the spellbook back.
[400:34.83]Okay.
[400:37.13]And then we got to do some Voidwalker stuff.
[400:42.35]Europe is bigger than WoW.
[400:43.44]Not in retail.
[400:45.16]I think retail WoW has more countries, more zones than Europe does.
[400:50.86]Oh, I would say absolutely.
[400:52.00]Alright.
[400:56.87]Capture of the Void.
[400:58.37]Need a Voidwalker.
[401:00.40]Recover Eaglin's Grimoire and bring it to Carind in Halgar in the Temple of the Damned.
[401:07.40]This is the Voidwalker quest.
[401:08.76]Alright, cool.
[401:09.34]Where is that?
[401:19.34]Is it just in here?
[401:30.17]Agent of the Scarlet Crusader has its secret base and tower to the west.
[401:33.11]Okay, so it is over there.
[401:40.00]Okay, so I gotta go get that.
[401:42.22]Um... I'm gonna get out of the undercity.
[401:47.72]I have to say, I got a bag full of shit, though.
[401:49.74]Let me do that.
[402:01.04]Did you get a cockroach pet to follow you?
[402:02.82]No.
[402:04.54]No.
[402:04.98]Nope.
[402:05.76]I don't want a pet.
[402:07.58]If I get a pet, it's going to be a little dog or a little cat or something.
[402:12.36]I don't know.
[402:22.59]There's a rat.
[402:25.73]Getting fishing to level 300.
[402:30.94]Wait, someone just got a snake?
[402:34.14]Holy shit, where'd you get that?
[402:35.04]That thing's pretty cool. ...
[403:03.94]Alright, now we gotta get out of here.
[403:05.28]Go get the Voidwalker.
[403:06.50]Voidwalker just makes your life so much safer.
[403:11.85]I don't know how anybody plays hardcore without a little dude that just runs into mobs for you.
[403:20.26]How do I get out of here?
[403:22.98]Up here, right?
[403:27.29]Yeah, I'm in the same server as the Only Fangs guild.
[403:30.32]I'm just not in the guild.
[403:33.06]I did just start and I am breaking all of the rules.
[403:38.74]So... I am in tutorial mode still though.
[404:01.56]Oh, boy.
[404:02.02]And see, everyone's going to blame me.
[404:06.22]People blame me for this.
[404:08.62]Okay, people are like, don't do that, man.
[404:10.22]You baited me.
[404:12.46]I'm just trying to go in the elevator.
[404:17.98]He tried to kill himself.
[404:19.40]That guy tried to kill himself.
[404:20.86]We all know it.
[404:21.34]Did it work?
[404:22.18]I don't know.
[404:24.24]That guy was naked.
[404:26.24]That guy was looking for the opportunity.
[404:28.16]Yeah, he just killed himself.
[404:33.44]Where do we- it's- wait, over here?
[404:34.80]Yeah.
[404:39.35]You can always tell.
[404:40.23]If somebody comes up to you and they're naked, expect them to die within 30 minutes.
[404:47.69]They'll find a cliff to jump off in front of you and just-
[405:03.59]Real life, too.
[405:08.87]Yeah, I would definitely not trust a naked guy just walking around the street.
[405:13.68]You're right.
[405:14.62]It's very true.
[405:24.89]This is pretty close, so that's fine.
[405:32.74]I got to put my ranks on.
[405:34.09]What am I, stupid?
[405:36.25]I'm not going to be a rank one guy.
[405:38.61]What the hell am I doing?
[405:39.97]I've got a couple.
[405:40.77]Oh man, no wonder.
[405:42.05]This is rank two.
[405:45.58]Okay.
[405:45.98]Yeah.
[405:46.32]What is going on here?
[405:47.76]This is so much better.
[405:51.24]That's 120 armor and it's five health per five.
[405:53.68]That's huge.
[406:01.24]I got rank two.
[406:01.80]Yeah, rank two immolate.
[406:03.98]Yeah, there we go.
[406:04.54]Let's get that on there.
[406:07.93]I was going to say that would have been bad.
[406:10.39]Did I get a new affliction spell?
[406:12.63]Oh, drain soul, right?
[406:17.16]Get it on the map.
[406:22.24]Everyone be careful.
[406:24.68]Naked guy.
[406:34.40]Oh boy, are we heading to Silverpine now?
[406:36.99]Uh, well, I mean, I- I am.
[406:49.31]Noob filter incoming?
[407:00.28]Yeah, this is- this is gonna be an ugly.
[407:06.34]The goons are gonna die.
[407:07.32]Yeah, I think the... We're gonna lose a few.
[407:10.66]Alright.
[407:24.39]Scarlet Zealot.
[407:26.61]Missionary.
[407:27.19]And then there are the rings.
[407:30.65]Wish I had this earlier.
[407:31.47]I was already here.
[407:35.56]Oh no, that was a different one.
[407:40.10]This is, I think this is all the way up.
[407:51.62]I need, I gotta do some, I gotta do some rebinds, man.
[407:58.90]I think I had to kill that guy.
[408:04.40]Yeah, this is this is crap.
[408:17.17]That's the void Walker and this is out here.
[408:28.30]I need this on cue.
[408:29.42]That's what I usually put it on.
[408:32.44]It's not getting credit.
[408:39.05]I think I'm very soon here.
[408:41.99]I want to layer.
[408:42.63]Because we could probably get a lot more.
[409:00.87]Let me move away first.
[409:02.37]Hold on.
[409:08.47]I gotta make Hellstone as well.
[409:10.63]Hellstone's not even on the bar.
[409:18.98]Where is Hellstone?
[409:21.12]There it is.
[409:23.86]This is effectively a healing potion.
[409:25.76]That you can just have an infinity of them.
[409:27.74]They do have a cooldown though.
[409:34.17]I want this back on.
[409:47.77]I think I'll be alright if I take this.
[409:53.49]Yeah, thank you for the lair.
[410:09.98]That big, there we go.
[410:12.16]Long laser beam.
[410:14.60]He almost died, dude.
[410:18.24]Why do you have such a little health?
[410:19.14]I don't want to get too many of these because the fill your bags get so full.
[410:41.12]Annoying.
[410:54.99]Boyd Walker has a taunt.
[410:56.31]That's good.
[410:56.75]Food crate.
[411:08.53]How come nobody got the food crate?
[411:17.81]Oh shit.
[411:21.15]That just reminded me I was in a party.
[411:36.26]Gotta pick up stuff.
[411:43.97]1v1 PvP challenge.
[411:45.09]One of your goon followers.
[411:49.85]If it's not a Makara, I would maybe.
[411:53.03]In a very safe place where nobody can kill me by having some random thing get aggroed to me.
[412:13.02]Oh, I got a red shirt.
[412:13.88]Let me see what that looks like.
[412:16.04]Oh, no, I didn't.
[412:16.54]I didn't even put it in my inventory.
[412:24.39]I have a 60 hunter.
[412:25.55]I can give you aspect of the pack.
[412:27.18]Why?
[412:27.34]So I get 30% movement speed permanently.
[412:32.30]No, I'm good.
[412:33.58]Thanks, though.
[412:36.66]I saw you did Wailing Caverns with Etalyx.
[412:38.12]Did that character die?
[412:39.26]No, that character is still alive.
[412:41.28]Still pretty much the same level.
[412:43.32]I didn't play it really much since then.
[412:51.29]Where are all these zealots?
[413:07.03]Don't you get dazed with the aspect of the pack?
[413:08.69]That's, yeah, I think you do, yeah.
[413:14.53]I guess we're traveling from place to place though, as long as it's not on during a, like a fight or an encounter or anything.
[413:24.62]These respawns, what is this nonsense?
[413:35.49]Watch this.
[413:42.89]Fighting a Warlock in PvP is so obnoxious.
[413:48.07]Because they can do that.
[413:48.99]There's also Death Coil.
[413:50.53]Was Death Coil in Classic?
[413:52.52]It's so annoying.
[413:59.32]Is your mic quiet?
[414:00.34]I'm talking a little gentler, I would say.
[414:08.13]it isn't classic yeah death coil is awesome and it heals you too so you have fear you have death coil you've got they have another disorient right the succubus and the incubus both have it right death coil into fear into three dots and life drain yeah it's crazy warlock was disgusting in pvp
[414:47.28]You got to be careful fearing in hardcore because they get the social aggro.
[414:53.47]Where if somebody runs and, oh, you feared him.
[414:56.85]He ran into this room.
[414:58.25]Every single thing in that room aggro's to you.
[415:01.40]It's a disaster.
[415:02.84]You got to be careful with it.
[415:03.56]That's why I haven't been using it at all.
[415:18.10]Have I crit with Shadowbolt once since I put that talent point in?
[415:23.95]I don't think I have.
[415:29.07]No, I've never hit 60 in hardcore before.
[415:32.30]Highest I've ever been in hardcore is where I currently am right now, which is I have a character that's 30.
[415:38.78]I have a hunter.
[415:44.30]Again, another pet class, right?
[415:45.91]Yeah.
[416:03.85]I only have three rings, dude.
[416:06.15]What?
[416:07.47]Dude, what?
[416:09.19]Bro, what?
[416:10.55]Man, what?
[416:18.98]Thunderfury is from... Didn't Thunderfury... Didn't the... What are the bindings?
[416:22.58]Didn't they drop from Ragnaros?
[416:25.10]Didn't Only Fangs get it?
[416:25.92]At least the first part of whatever that chain is to get it.
[416:42.24]How did I not kill the captain?
[416:43.36]I think that's the first person I probably would have killed.
[416:56.30]Wait, are you doing captain?
[416:57.12]We could work together.
[417:12.84]You can always show that you're friendly by helping somebody kill the thing that they're killing.
[417:30.51]Invite this person too, maybe?
[417:38.65]Gar and Geddon drop the halves.
[417:48.83]Baron Geddon.
[417:50.83]Oh shit, there he is.
[417:52.79]Why'd you stand in the room?
[418:16.96]I could get out of the way though.
[418:18.24]This is as safe as I feel.
[418:20.58]All it takes is one bad spawn and I could just get trapped.
[418:36.41]Can more people have these rings?
[418:41.10]A lot of these people are not wearing the- the company- the- the ring, the military outfit ring.
[418:47.91]You don't have the whole outfit on.
[418:51.53]Whatever this is, this- yeah, your zealot- whatever this zealot outfit is.
[418:54.29]You don't have the whole thing on.
[418:58.67]You should eat something.
[419:04.37]I- I ate a lot before this stream, but that's a good reminder.
[419:07.57]I- I have a sandwich in the fridge, ready?
[419:14.48]The guy spawned again and I'm not even over there.
[419:18.40]Wait.
[419:21.09]Fuck.
[419:26.07]Oh.
[419:35.67]What's in the sandwich?
[419:36.33]It's a turkey sandwich on wheat bread.
[419:43.53]Wait, weren't we just in a party?
[419:44.43]Wait, why did we... What happened?
[419:51.33]We both didn't get it.
[420:00.36]Uh, no, that's I mean, Turkey is the main ingredients.
[420:03.08]Turkey.
[420:04.50]Avocado.
[420:06.16]Provolone.
[420:06.68]A little bit of Mayo, wheat bread.
[420:09.56]And I'll probably.
[420:10.89]If I eat a lot early in the day, I'm usually good till at least dinner time.
[420:26.11]OK, we should definitely get it now.
[420:38.58]Two days ago, say goodbye to 12 hour streams.
[420:42.16]Literally today.
[420:44.44]Well, it's been seven, not 12.
[420:54.37]Nice, we got it.
[420:56.33]Now I just need a shitload more rings.
[420:58.92]Hooray.
[421:13.01]I mean, do I have to do that?
[421:16.05]Do I really care?
[421:19.03]What do you get for this?
[421:20.37]I don't know.
[421:21.73]Fuck this quest.
[421:22.49]I'm out of here.
[421:26.64]Is this part of a chain or can I just leave?
[421:37.03]Is it part of a chain?
[421:43.17]I mean, I think this has been part of a chain all the way here.
[421:45.25]Alright, I'm going to kill... If I don't get at least two more rings in the next three kills, I'm done.
[421:50.36]I'm just going to... I'll leave.
[421:51.70]Let's get my Voidwalker.
[421:52.50]Okay, good.
[422:02.30]There's one.
[422:08.89]Will you ever do another House Flipper event?
[422:10.43]Uh-oh.
[422:36.35]Yeah, you know what?
[422:37.27]Let's talk about it.
[422:38.87]I've actually been talking to the devs of House Flipper.
[422:42.67]I think we're going to do a pretty big, cool, potential collaboration.
[422:56.50]Still working on the details.
[422:57.98]Still getting it done, but... Remember last time, the House Flipper... These guys are awesome, by the way.
[423:07.00]Uh, remember I streamed it a few times and I did that, you know, the event and everything.
[423:10.77]And, um, some of those streams were sponsored and they, they were just like, yeah, we just, we want to obviously like support the channel and we like the stuff that you do.
[423:22.94]And it was just, they're really cool.
[423:24.78]So I think we're going to work out something again too.
[423:28.20]And I love that game.
[423:30.66]I love everything about that whole franchise.
[423:32.54]I mean, it's just something that I've always thought was just quirky and weird and fun and stuff.
[423:35.70]So.
[423:38.94]So yeah, the plan is as part of a... of doing some stuff with House Flipper.
[423:47.10]Do maybe a couple of sponsored things with them.
[423:49.79]And then the idea is I want to do another big one.
[423:54.45]And this will be the third one.
[423:56.23]So this one, I'm going to try to make it as big as I could possibly do it.
[424:03.29]So when you talk about like event streams, like, oh, are you ever going to do those again?
[424:09.47]That's one of those things that I can do and still have fun with and not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars doing it.
[424:28.09]Because it's the idea now of trying to, well, yeah, let me try to track down half a million dollars to do this big show.
[424:38.45]I love doing that.
[424:39.19]And I always have done.
[424:39.91]And I don't think I'll ever stop caring about doing that kind of stuff.
[424:44.08]But it's just kind of hard to do that.
[425:02.82]IRL house slipper?
[425:04.12]No, no.
[425:04.86]This would be another... It'd be the third in the series.
[425:12.77]Inventory full, huh?
[425:15.74]And this one's going to be different.
[425:16.60]They've all been a little bit different from each other.
[425:18.14]This one's going to be pretty different.
[425:20.14]But I think in probably the coolest way possible.
[425:24.42]Because if you don't know, House Flipper is... They've got a lot of cool updates that they're doing and working on and stuff.
[425:36.99]And I'm going to be trying to essentially have... Oh my god, a lot of people just showed up.
[425:51.07]You've checked the same corpse four times.
[425:52.79]I know, whatever, it's gonna... That's just the way it is, man.
[425:59.81]Well, when the thing is shiny and I'm talking, it's just like, there's something on that.
[426:03.14]Alright, I'm almost done.
[426:09.68]But I've already kind of been starting to throw a little temperature checks to people that just barely, as I want to say, as of the last three or four days, last week, maybe.
[426:22.72]And I've got some ideas.
[426:25.16]At the very least, I think it'll be fun.
[426:26.50]It'll be fun to just do it and see what people can come up with and stuff, especially with some of the new criteria that would be in this one.
[426:42.25]What about Night Rain?
[426:45.75]Yeah, I'm sure I'll be playing that absolutely with people.
[426:49.51]I mean, Master and I, 100% at the very minimum.
[426:53.87]I feel like Ster and I have done a lot of the Elden Ring co-op together, so it makes a lot of sense that I'd see if he'd want to do it.
[427:01.35]But it's three, though, right?
[427:03.11]I think it's... You can only do it with three, can't you?
[427:07.78]Yeah, so we do... I don't know, one of the horsemen or like, you know, like a Etalyx I'm sure would play it or... Anybody else that we would gel with.
[427:23.71]Yeah, no four horsemen.
[427:33.57]Unfortunate.
[427:34.49]I have Vinny too, I'm sure.
[427:35.51]Yeah, there's plenty of people that would probably be down to do it.
[427:38.27]It's going to be the big thing.
[427:44.47]I feel like when that comes out, there'll be like two million concurrent viewers on it.
[427:51.24]Because that would be the only thing that's being streamed.
[427:53.33]Oh, I got them all.
[427:53.85]I'm good.
[427:56.67]Alright.
[427:57.19]We're going to go up here, down here.
[427:59.23]And then I'm going to seriously assess if I'm going to stay alive.
[428:05.67]And if I am going to stay alive, I might take a little food break.
[428:11.30]An extended kind of little, you know, like 15 minutes, 20 minutes.
[428:31.86]Eat the turkey sandwich on stream.
[428:34.14]I always hate eating on stream.
[428:40.83]Okay, imagine you're sitting there.
[428:42.12]Yeah, I want you to think about this.
[428:44.68]Those of you that are just hanging out.
[428:46.80]You're sitting in a chair and you're at your, let's call it your dinner table.
[428:50.85]You're sitting at your breakfast nook, whatever you have, whatever.
[428:55.99]And there are 12,000 people watching you eat at the same time.
[429:03.89]And they're just staring at you eating food.
[429:12.10]I don't want one person watching me eat, let alone 12,000.
[429:24.47]Guys, I was definitely like a cat in a previous life.
[429:26.79]I had to have been.
[429:27.71]Or a bird or something.
[429:29.81]I don't want anyone to be near me when I use the bathroom.
[429:33.08]Leave me the fuck alone.
[429:33.88]I can get moody.
[429:35.50]I'm very particular about where I eat and who's near me when I'm eating.
[429:42.48]I almost leveled a lot.
[429:49.57]I'll get 11 right here.
[429:52.89]I should have probably made the Hearthstone grill, but I'm going to be leaving here soon anyways, so.
[430:05.67]I got a lot of bullshit here.
[430:06.81]I mean, I could also stream tomorrow too, and it's funny, like there's like a few things that I said I wanted to do.
[430:24.24]Am I just going to be retired old man just plays World of Warcraft and streams his entire life on WoW?
[430:38.63]I don't think that's going to happen.
[430:41.27]But the nature of playing a game like this, you kind of need to commit at least a little.
[430:47.30]You've got to commit at least somewhat.
[430:51.20]And I think I'm willing to commit at least enough to enjoy playing at least the low levels.
[430:55.58]We'll see.
[430:55.90]A lot of cheese.
[431:08.45]I can get rid of these now.
[431:09.29]I don't need them anymore.
[431:09.97]I got the better version anyways.
[431:27.77]How do I still have way too much shit?
[431:42.00]Bags are too small.
[431:43.26]Hey, I think I can learn Journeyman first aid.
[431:55.69]Embrace the shadow.
[431:59.92]These get expensive though.
[432:08.74]That's not bad.
[432:12.85]So that'll get me to what?
[432:15.47]Out of 150 instead of 75?
[432:17.47]Okay.
[432:27.68]Wool is 80.
[432:30.52]Not quite there yet.
[432:31.26]I got a lot of turn ins to do.
[432:42.78]That's why I have a bunch of shit in my bags.
[432:52.63]Would you shave your head for five gifted subs?
[432:55.73]The price is 1.5 million.
[432:59.87]You can arrange a wire or something if you, uh, if however you want to do it and figure it out.
[433:04.21]These are better.
[433:10.82]Nice.
[433:11.58]Alright.
[433:12.82]Um, the mana one is not a concern right now.
[433:16.60]Just make this 8%.
[433:22.67]Good.
[433:23.05]I would love to crit with my shadow bolt once.
[433:29.28]If you shave that shit, it's not coming back.
[433:31.08]And that's a terror.
[433:32.04]You know, hey, why do you have such a long hair now?
[433:36.50]Because I kind of believe that if I shave it off, if I cut it down and maybe it's never going to come back.
[433:49.76]This might be the last real opportunity the last year or two in the next couple of years to have a head of hair like this until I'm dead.
[434:00.23]Think about that.
[434:02.25]Really think about that.
[434:05.35]This could be the best my hair will ever look going forward ever.
[434:12.11]So I'm going to let it just flow, man.
[434:14.47]At least for a little while.
[434:18.63]Hey, you got to see, otherwise you'll never know.
[434:20.92]I will never know what that would be like.
[434:25.26]Because once that starts going back and you get the mad scientist, now you're a mad scientist.
[434:29.42]See, a lot of people are like, oh, Jerma, I love your hair.
[434:32.34]It looks so good.
[434:33.70]The second that that goes half an inch back, I'm now a mad scientist now.
[434:39.00]And you go from, ooh, wow, look good.
[434:41.69]Whoa, he's casting fucking potions and spells at us.
[434:45.19]It happens at exactly at half an inch up the forehead.
[434:55.13]You go from dashing to maniacally laughing very quickly.
[435:00.60]And I don't think I want to do that.
[435:08.89]Alright.
[435:09.81]I need to go.
[435:10.29]Let's do this first.
[435:10.85]Let's clean this up.
[435:14.23]Get the, let's at least get the void walker.
[435:27.57]My granddad had a full head of hair at like 90.
[435:30.51]Oh yeah, that's.
[435:32.31]Oh, what a great feeling that must be.
[435:36.73]Looking in the mirror at 90 and you.
[435:40.41]You can just run your fingers through your hair still at 90.
[435:43.25]What would I say?
[435:47.52]Stress right?
[435:48.72]Reduce the stress.
[435:51.68]Drink some more green tea.
[435:57.16]It's all stress.
[435:57.78]It really is.
[435:58.24]Stress fucks you up big time.
[436:01.32]You know, I never believed that.
[436:02.96]I always was like, yeah, whatever.
[436:04.90]Well, that's probably like suedo science dog shit.
[436:09.11]No, it's real.
[436:11.51]Trust me.
[436:13.01]That is real.
[436:14.99]A lot of suedo.
[436:16.47]A lot of it.
[436:18.09]Suedo.
[436:21.15]A lot of stress can just wreak havoc on your whole body.
[436:25.79]It's like smoking a pack of cigarettes a week.
[436:30.54]It's just so bad.
[436:31.50]And there's been a lot of times where I've been pretty stressed out.
[436:35.48]I mean, I'm a pretty neurotic person anyways.
[436:37.60]Cortisol is, yeah.
[436:45.51]Lately, I've been trying to dial it down a lot.
[436:50.01]I mean, getting a little older.
[436:53.87]Can't like just be so jacked up and neurotic and it's just it's not going to work.
[437:07.08]Over the long term, that is not going to be helpful.
[437:22.53]It's based on what happened to your mother's dad.
[437:24.51]Yeah, I think it skips a generation, too.
[437:32.33]I think if your mother's side has a full head of hair, that's when you go, ooh, uh-oh.
[437:39.95]But if your mother's side is currently bald, right, and the generation after is you, then I think you're fine.
[437:47.29]That could be suedo science as well.
[438:04.26]How do I still have so much shit?
[438:15.22]Corndogs... I gotta be in the mood for it.
[438:17.23]They're good though.
[438:19.63]Corndogs you eat one?
[438:22.70]at the county fair and then have like a dark green shit an hour later and then you're like whoa okay well let's not do that again
[438:45.88]Do you enjoy anything?
[438:47.14]I talk about all things I love.
[438:49.24]All I've been talking about is I like this.
[438:51.32]I like peppermint tea.
[438:52.38]I like green tea.
[438:53.23]You know what?
[438:53.85]I like sleeping in a hammock.
[438:56.31]I feel like I only talk about things I like.
[438:59.15]Is this real?
[439:08.64]I don't remember.
[439:24.56]Alright, the Voidwalker can kill you.
[439:26.70]I have to be careful because the Voidwalker is actually kind of scary.
[439:29.66]Alright, so you bring the book back.
[439:37.09]And then use the runes of summoning.
[439:39.57]Summon and subdue a Voidwalker.
[439:40.93]Alright, we're going to let... Jackquaz is going to get all the aggro.
[439:52.42]Alright, here we go.
[439:53.74]Here we go.
[439:54.06]You ready?
[439:55.62]What if this kills me?
[439:56.42]What level is this thing?
[439:59.58]I'm apparently... I think I'll be fine.
[440:01.34]Let's go.
[440:01.74]I'll just run.
[440:03.49]I'll just run and scream.
[440:04.95]If, uh... I'm just already dying on the Voidwalker quest.
[440:08.43]That's sad.
[440:11.87]Read Etalyx' message.
[440:13.03]It's in, like, the giant whisper.
[440:15.17]Remember I told you about my mail?
[440:16.55]It's in there.
[440:17.11]Okay, here it comes.
[440:21.26]You get him.
[440:21.64]Get him.
[440:21.86]You get him.
[440:22.24]You get him.
[440:22.58]You get him.
[440:22.86]I don't want to fight.
[440:23.50]You get him.
[440:23.78]Alright.
[440:25.62]Good.
[440:25.76]Alright.
[440:37.49]We're good.
[440:40.55]He's here in your chat.
[440:41.59]Oh, what did you say?
[440:45.99]Got the Voidwalker.
[440:46.99]Let's go.
[440:55.88]Dude, I just roached on my own pet.
[441:00.08]I just realized that.
[441:01.24]I roached on my pet.
[441:04.81]Whoa, don't trust me with anything.
[441:10.89]Yeah, don't trust me with anything.
[441:20.70]Pathological Roacher.
[441:22.18]Alright, so this is... Is this real?
[441:25.12]Are you the real Etalyx?
[441:28.80]You're right behind me.
[441:29.64]Oh, Warrior.
[441:35.47]Okay.
[441:42.13]I just got Voidwalker.
[441:43.11]Can you see... Can you use any of this?
[441:47.11]Oh, sorry.
[441:47.73]I have all trades off.
[441:53.03]Just looted.
[441:53.55]This is legit loot.
[441:56.39]Oh shit.
[441:59.51]Holy shit.
[442:03.17]I'm getting this from a friend.
[442:05.15]So this is, um, this doesn't count as cheating because I'm getting it as a, from a friend.
[442:21.15]Give you a quick little tip.
[442:22.67]Wait, no, I have money.
[442:23.87]Here.
[442:28.89]What's a good tip?
[442:30.36]What's a good tip for a friend?
[442:32.20]My add-on is... Oh, wait.
[442:33.64]I don't think he can trade with me.
[442:36.12]He's in Only Fangs.
[442:37.58]Is he?
[442:39.24]I don't think we can trade.
[442:44.74]Oh, not in the guild on this character.
[442:45.96]Okay.
[442:50.06]Alright, how about, let's skip two copper.
[442:53.16]I mean, two silver, that sounds kind of good.
[443:08.20]One copper, one copper is insulting.
[443:10.72]Anything under one silver is an insult.
[443:19.76]This stuff is worth way more than that.
[443:23.16]Yeah, let's get... what do I got?
[443:24.82]That's... That's like 20% of my net worth.
[443:29.10]This is all worth it.
[443:29.76]This is all good.
[443:30.30]This is good shit.
[443:36.84]I looted all this cloth.
[443:38.00]Why?
[443:38.50]What is with the... Oh, I thought he was writing that.
[443:41.57]I was like, why is he censoring his own... What is he doing?
[443:44.33]I have the profanity filter on.
[443:49.40]I thought he was doing that on purpose.
[443:50.70]I was like, why is he writing like the swear word thing?
[443:54.90]All class.
[443:55.28]Alright, let's take a look.
[443:57.12]Let me see what we got.
[443:59.38]Oh, two int, one stam.
[444:03.69]Int is also mana.
[444:05.73]And warlocks love mana.
[444:07.99]Ooh, that's good.
[444:08.73]What does it look like?
[444:10.13]Perfect.
[444:10.67]You can see the tuxedo.
[444:13.89]Was it boots too, right?
[444:17.64]Spirit is regen for those that don't know.
[444:19.50]Ooh, looking good.
[444:28.90]And then offhand.
[444:29.66]Ooh, I can put that on.
[444:33.67]Kind of decked out right now.
[444:36.37]I got a lot.
[444:36.89]Holy shit, look at this.
[444:40.43]I look even frailer than I did 10 minutes ago.
[444:49.81]Yeah, you should keep those for sure.
[444:53.81]Level 12.
[444:54.11]What am I?
[444:55.03]Level 11?
[444:57.34]What level is, um... Ragefire?
[445:00.26]We would get the... We would get destroyed if we went to Ragefire at level 11 and 12.
[445:03.42]Alright, people are making fun of my UI scaling.
[445:14.33]I want to be able to see the pictures.
[445:15.45]Otherwise, I can't see.
[445:19.27]14 to 15, yeah.
[445:27.69]Disable the art bar, at least.
[445:31.13]But that's cool.
[445:31.63]I got gargoyles on my bar.
[445:44.94]Uh, oh, he's gone.
[445:48.08]Etalyx, if you're still, if you're watching, if you're still here.
[445:51.30]I don't think I'm going to get to 15 tonight.
[445:56.52]But I think I might be addicted to the game now.
[445:58.18]So that's, oh, I thought that was him.
[446:05.79]Voidwalker.
[446:07.19]Voidwalker is awesome.
[446:11.87]Voidwalker uses a soul shard, which is fine.
[446:22.60]Cowmon.
[446:24.86]Cool.
[446:28.24]I actually think I can get a book.
[446:31.96]Or, uh, another one of his.
[446:34.88]Because you want the other one too.
[446:35.90]Voidwalker has an amazing move.
[446:37.92]It is the best oh shit button.
[446:40.32]You sacrifice the Voidwalker and you get that gigantic shield that is like your whole health pool again.
[446:47.02]It's amazing.
[446:56.48]But if you want to do... I'll... I'll be around.
[447:01.32]Let's do it tomorrow.
[447:02.78]You want to do Ragefire tomorrow?
[447:11.32]I guess not.
[447:11.72]When is it?
[447:12.26]What do you get?
[447:19.88]Torment.
[447:20.30]Where is it?
[447:25.32]Fire Shield.
[447:26.06]26.
[447:26.08]Okay, level 18 is Consume Shadows.
[447:31.55]That's the heal.
[447:34.21]Voidwalker Sacrifice.
[447:35.21]There it is.
[447:36.17]When do you get that?
[447:44.66]Can't see it.
[447:45.26]Torment, Torment, Torment.
[447:56.75]Oh, there it is.
[447:57.65]I got 16.
[448:01.88]It's not that far.
[448:07.64]I think I got everything I know until 12.
[448:09.26]Alright.
[448:17.41]I think... I think that's probably gonna be it.
[448:31.53]I want to go eat.
[448:34.18]And I haven't done a more than, I haven't had a stream like this in a long time.
[448:38.58]I feel like, hey, I haven't done a more than a four or five hour stream in two years.
[448:43.31]I feel like you don't just immediately eat the whole box of cookies.
[448:47.31]You don't just eat, oh yeah, why don't you eat the whole fucking box?
[448:49.55]No, you gotta pace ourselves here.
[448:57.92]But yeah, I'm having fun.
[448:59.64]I think this was really fun.
[449:01.02]I hope everybody thought it was chill and... I do very much enjoy... just kinda hanging out.
[449:10.26]It's fun.
[449:13.62]It's relaxing too.
[449:14.36]This game's relaxing.
[449:15.50]Even in hardcore.
[449:16.44]Which is bad.
[449:16.96]Because eventually it's gonna get hard.
[449:23.88]I cannot promise that I'm gonna do this all the way to 60.
[449:30.62]But I guess we'll see how far it goes.
[449:38.43]If people enjoy it and people are having fun and people think it's a good place just to kind of hang out, then why not?
[449:49.67]Otto the dog.
[449:51.51]I'm surprised.
[449:52.49]What level are you, Otto the dog?
[449:54.15]Level five.
[449:56.11]How could you possibly be that much lower than me?
[450:08.85]He's just a little guy.
[450:09.97]He's level five.
[450:16.65]Auto is small, yeah.
[450:18.78]Alright guys, I'll see you later.
[450:21.34]I'll probably just honestly just start where I am right now tomorrow.
[450:24.28]I might, you know what?
[450:24.84]I might go early tomorrow.
[450:27.66]I might do like a morning.
[450:30.35]And stop at some point in the afternoon.
[450:35.38]I know there's a lot of people that are like, I can't believe we were about to finish Nancy Drew and the Infinity Nikki fit showcase.
[450:46.30]And he got addicted to World of Warcraft.
[450:48.68]He's not going to happen for like two years.
[450:55.65]I know.
[451:02.59]Trust me.
[451:02.97]Oh my God.
[451:03.37]I just punched you.
[451:08.60]That's a haha for real.
[451:10.08]Yeah, that's a haha for real.
[451:14.14]Alright.
[451:14.64]Anyways, see you later.
[451:15.66]See you tomorrow.
[451:16.74]We'll continue the journey.
[451:19.20]Will I live or die?
[451:20.34]That's for you to find out tomorrow.
[451:23.24]If you show up tomorrow morning.
[451:27.60]I'd say it's something around noon PST.
[451:30.40]Like between 10 a.m.
[451:31.68]and noon PST.
[451:40.22]Take care of yourselves.
[451:40.96]Have a good rest of your night.
[451:52.25]Thanks for kicking around.
[452:00.92]He's getting away with saying suedo.
[452:06.42]Suedo science.
[452:21.28]Let's see, if I get through, because there's a big difference between playing on stream and off stream.
[452:26.72]Off stream, I feel like I can do anything and like I'm doing like my APM is a thousand APM.
[452:31.59]I'm just like click, click, dive to fear.
[452:34.45]But on stream, we just like talk, we talk about shit and I get distracted.
[452:38.06]So getting through whaling caverns is my goal.
[452:42.06]If I get through whaling caverns, then I think I'm good.
[452:54.18]Yeah, probably around like 11 a.m.
[452:55.17]tomorrow.
[452:56.41]Pacific.
[453:06.03]Does your webcam still have a frame from the last time it was on?
[453:09.58]Nah, I think that clears when the PC turns off, I think.
[453:18.90]VRChat with four horsemen.
[453:21.86]Yeah, I'm down.
[453:29.41]Is this a PvP server?
[453:30.51]I don't think the Anniversary Hardcore, I think it's PvE only.
[453:33.37]I don't know if you're asking that to see if you're on an Alliance character and you can come find me in Stranglethorn in like a week.
[453:43.82]And like do an aimed shot and shoot me in the fucking head.
[453:46.84]That's not in the Anniversary servers.
[453:57.89]Like, I can just hear like the, like, oh, there's a hunter over there.
