[00:01.47]Hey.
[00:03.83]What's going on?
[00:04.51]Sorry.
[00:05.25]Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:08.09]I was like ready to start like 25 minutes ago, but I couldn't find my fucking brace.
[00:13.52]And after last night, I was like, I have to, I gotta find it.
[00:17.56]So I was going through all the laundry, trying to find where it was.
[00:21.66]Did I wash it?
[00:22.38]Where is it?
[00:23.92]And I, uh, I got it.
[00:25.60]I found it.
[00:25.98]Thank God.
[00:31.11]I was here like 40 minutes ago.
[00:34.20]When you lose something in your house, you just can never find it.
[00:38.06]I hate losing stuff.
[00:41.58]Everybody does, though.
[00:43.79]Anyways, today... I hope you're having a good day today.
[00:46.47]We're going to be playing Mega Man Legends.
[00:49.03]Finally.
[00:51.03]Not pushing it back anymore.
[00:52.35]It's happening today.
[00:55.37]not gonna say, yeah, then we'll do Mega Man Legends tomorrow.
[00:59.21]That doesn't happen.
[01:00.13]Yeah, then we'll do Mega Man Legends next week.
[01:02.71]And it doesn't happen.
[01:06.23]It's been delayed like five times.
[01:08.05]So, here it is.
[01:11.60]He's actually playing it.
[01:12.82]I can't fucking pog.
[01:17.26]Pog.
[01:18.80]Black and White 2 is...
[01:26.52]No, I'm not going to enable Pog.
[01:27.56]I'd like to read it.
[01:30.02]It has more meaning for me.
[01:32.32]If I read it out loud.
[01:33.47]There's already PogChamp.
[01:36.87]Pog is... It needs to be... I want to read it.
[01:42.57]But... What did somebody just ask?
[01:44.01]Somebody ask something?
[01:50.49]Paperclip game?
[01:53.05]I beat that whole thing yesterday.
[01:54.43]Black and White 2.
[01:55.01]There it is.
[01:55.31]Okay, right.
[01:56.66]So, Black and White 2.
[01:59.26]I had technical issues with it.
[02:01.78]But now I... It should be good to go.
[02:07.61]After a few more tweaks.
[02:12.79]So that is on the table after this stream.
[02:19.11]So, Mega Man Legends tonight.
[02:20.35]I think I can do this in one stream.
[02:24.28]Right?
[02:25.60]Mega Man Legends is only like a six, seven hour long game, isn't it?
[02:31.47]No, it's not?
[02:32.47]How long is it?
[02:38.69]Okay, according to howlongtobeat.com, it's a seven hour game, but you have to add on the three or four hours of ADHD.
[02:47.42]So, we're looking at probably like eight to twelve hours?
[02:57.79]Seven hours?
[02:58.33]Well, we'll see.
[02:58.99]We'll see how far we get.
[02:59.81]I could do it another time.
[03:01.75]The goal is to try to get it done today.
[03:04.54]I'm not going to be live over the next couple days.
[03:06.20]I have physical therapy.
[03:07.76]So, we'll try to get another long one tonight.
[03:10.40]Got my boomer brace on.
[03:11.36]I'm good to go.
[03:17.01]The Sonic movie was good.
[03:18.05]That's what I heard.
[03:18.57]That's what I said the other day.
[03:20.35]Yesterday.
[03:22.81]Prove that you have your boomer brace on.
[03:26.45]Okay.
[03:26.85]Hold on.
[03:28.07]Remember these guys?
[03:31.84]Nah.
[03:32.52]What if I just was lying?
[03:33.68]Nah, nah.
[03:34.26]I don't need to put... Nah.
[03:36.24]My camera's not working.
[03:37.20]I can't.
[03:37.50]Like, it doesn't work.
[03:38.30]My fucking... The plug doesn't work.
[03:42.40]Hold on here.
[03:44.28]You want proof?
[03:46.38]Here.
[03:47.58]I've got my... I've got my backpack on.
[03:50.16]So, you can't see down here, but what this does... Villain.
[03:53.91]Yeah, I know.
[03:55.47]What this does is that it's not just this.
[03:58.29]It's here, too.
[04:00.03]You're like...
[04:02.92]I'm not going to stand up on my chair, but it goes all the way down and wraps around the bottom of my ribs and pulls them together.
[04:10.64]And it feels pretty good, actually.
[04:19.34]Wesker?
[04:21.12]I could probably pull off a Wesker if I had the glasses.
[04:23.20]Do you think so?
[04:23.66]Alright, I'm ready to play.
[04:30.91]If I had the glasses and... What's the buzz?
[04:34.35]I hear a buzz.
[04:38.07]What's the buzz?
[04:39.75]Hold on.
[04:42.21]Anybody hear a buzz?
[04:44.45]You will.
[04:46.11]Why is it buzzing?
[04:49.31]What the fuck is going on?
[04:53.54]Hold on.
[04:56.90]What the fuck?
[04:57.40]Why is there a buzz?
[04:59.26]It's getting louder.
[05:02.90]What?
[05:03.20]It's like somebody turned on the microwave.
[05:06.20]Next to my PlayStation.
[05:09.20]Oh!
[05:10.32]Hold on.
[05:11.82]Give me a second.
[05:12.28]Let me fix this.
[05:12.70]Is it gone?
[05:24.69]It's gone.
[05:25.01]Alright, hold on.
[05:26.13]I gotta like... Somebody move.
[05:37.60]Is it gone?
[05:44.41]It's there a little.
[05:45.07]It's alright.
[05:46.33]It's fine.
[05:51.71]Okay.
[05:55.67]It's there a little, but why is this happening right now?
[05:57.67]The fucking cable is fucked up.
[06:00.32]Alright.
[06:02.16]Alright, here we go.
[06:03.46]We get big bits?
[06:04.12]Where?
[06:04.32]Where?
[06:08.71]It's not as loud as it was before.
[06:10.71]It's something to do with this cable, I think.
[06:12.07]Cable's fucked up.
[06:13.37]I don't know what I did to it.
[06:15.01]Maybe it has something to do with turning the console upside down to play Jammer Lamy and, like, breaking it.
[06:19.49]Alright, everything's fine.
[06:21.99]Everything's gonna be fine.
[06:27.68]Alright!
[06:28.50]Welcome to the stream.
[06:29.12]Let's start a new game, Mega Man Legends.
[06:30.52]I had big bits.
[06:32.68]I like the voice acting already.
[06:36.36]Mega Man?
[06:37.89]So where does this sit in the timeline for Mega Man?
[06:43.88]He's like 20?
[06:45.02]How old is he?
[07:12.85]Yeah, the crystal?
[07:13.95]We have big bits.
[07:15.31]I'll go over in a second.
[07:17.43]Hold on.
[07:17.81]Phew.
[07:42.63]I remember this game being fucking awesome.
[07:45.95]Am I wrong?
[07:47.31]Or am I right here?
[07:50.52]Is this a running sequence?
[07:57.80]It looks pretty good still.
[07:58.84]This is PlayStation 1.
[07:59.94]This is PS1, guys.
[08:15.00]This is not emulation.
[08:16.72]This is not... This is all original hardware.
[08:18.70]Well, PlayStation 2.
[08:20.50]But still.
[08:21.06]It looks pretty good for PS1.
[08:23.63]Oh, shit.
[08:24.21]Alright, hold on.
[08:24.69]So that's... Oh, wow.
[08:28.17]It's full 3D.
[08:29.47]One of the first ever full 3D games.
[08:32.63]Okay.
[08:33.03]A Reaverbot.
[08:40.81]Reaver button.
[08:42.45]Okay.
[08:45.93]Use square to fire.
[08:46.93]Press the R2 button to automatically lock onto the nearest target.
[08:50.71]Alright, yeah.
[08:57.49]These things?
[09:01.81]Oh, there it is.
[09:03.73]Oh, shit.
[09:04.25]That's awesome.
[09:04.89]Alright, let's go.
[09:12.78]Alright, I already love it.
[09:15.01]I already love it.
[09:17.55]This is janky?
[09:24.97]No, it's not.
[09:27.36]This is the most legendary Mega Man game that's ever been released.
[09:37.22]I do.
[09:37.80]It's right here.
[09:40.11]It's right in front of me.
[09:43.87]It's not far from your current position.
[09:46.39]Dude, I can't wait just to do the fucking stock market minigame that's in this one, too.
[09:51.26]That's it.
[09:51.82]Yeah, always open stuff.
[09:58.12]Watch out!
[09:58.62]There's something right in front of you!
[10:02.50]Oh, shit!
[10:07.15]Uh, is there a zoom out the camera button?
[10:11.33]I can't wait till I get upgrades.
[10:20.16]I don't know.
[10:21.08]No, I don't like this.
[10:22.84]I want to pull the camera out a little bit.
[10:24.90]No, I don't like it.
[10:25.82]Increase FOV.
[10:32.75]No, actually, it's pretty good.
[10:34.37]The one thing I wish I could do is make... Alright, I can jump, right?
[10:42.49]A, B, X.
[10:45.86]Use X to jump.
[10:47.38]If you can't make it in one jump, you can sometimes grab onto the edge and pull yourself up.
[10:54.82]Cool.
[10:57.32]There is a jump here.
[10:58.20]I want to make... Can I... Free look.
[11:04.27]Map.
[11:06.31]Wait.
[11:06.71]Directional button.
[11:08.99]Turn.
[11:09.59]So, wait a minute.
[11:10.31]So I can do...
[11:12.71]What the hell does that mean?
[11:13.69]Because I want to make it so... I wish I could do my right stick, but the right stick didn't exist for PlayStation 1, right?
[11:23.43]The voices are quiet?
[11:24.73]I mean, I don't think there's anything I can do about that.
[11:28.05]Did it?
[11:28.51]No, it didn't.
[11:29.09]It did?
[11:29.37]It had the left stick, right?
[11:31.01]No.
[11:31.27]What?
[11:31.45]Did it have two sticks?
[11:32.35]Did the PlayStation 1 originally... No, it didn't have any.
[11:39.71]Oh, that's way better.
[11:41.37]Yeah, I don't want L1, R1 to turn.
[11:44.85]That's so much better.
[11:49.43]Yeah, that's a thousand times better.
[11:50.67]I can actually turn.
[12:07.74]It's kind of like tank controls when you do this, but it's alright.
[12:12.44]It's much better than it was before.
[12:18.49]What is that?
[12:19.97]Oh, it's alive.
[12:21.29]Wait, should I jump on it?
[12:23.91]Okay, can I not grab this ledge?
[12:30.09]Oh, this is a ton of money.
[12:31.95]Oh, nice.
[12:33.76]Explanation.
[12:34.58]Quantum refractors are large crystals that provide energy for machines.
[12:38.08]They can also be used as currency.
[12:39.42]Not a big deal.
[12:40.70]If you're finally lucky, if you're really lucky, you might find an orange energy cube.
[12:44.84]Grab it to recharge your life gauge.
[12:57.88]Oh my god, it disappeared.
[12:59.28]Oh, what?
[13:00.98]Oh, that was so much money that I don't have now.
[13:04.01]Holy shit, I was too slow.
[13:08.83]How could I have been?
[13:09.57]What?
[13:09.83]What was that?
[13:22.06]Oh, it's an energy field.
[13:24.88]Whip, Mega Man, whip.
[13:28.70]Okay, fuck you game.
[13:31.24]I thought Mega Man was two words.
[13:32.68]Do I have to change everything?
[13:33.56]Do I have to change my title?
[13:36.06]Use R2 to track enemies above and below you that are out of your field of sight.
[13:44.46]Oh, look, you're up there, aren't you?
[13:45.75]Oh, shit.
[13:54.71]Maybe I actually want to keep it on L1R1.
[13:56.35]I feel like it's a part of the... Yeah, maybe I do.
[13:58.54]What do you think?
[14:09.91]Yeah.
[14:11.95]Yeah, I think I'll get used to it.
[14:13.31]I'll get used to it.
[14:18.15]Because then I can actually keep enemies in frame.
[14:20.95]Yeah.
[14:21.47]I'll get used to it.
[14:22.31]L1, R1.
[14:23.69]Say the line.
[14:24.41]That wasn't even a giant... That was not even a... No.
[14:28.39]I don't say the line for things that aren't even the line.
[14:35.05]Come on.
[14:35.45]Get it.
[14:37.73]Just like the original Mega Man.
[14:38.71]You jump and... Jump.
[14:40.65]Jump.
[14:40.93]Jump.
[14:55.39]Jump and shoot, jump and shoot, yeah?
[14:57.39]Ooh.
[15:01.43]You found 560 zeny.
[15:02.23]Hold on, there's a Kingdom Hearts currency?
[15:08.76]You got Power Razor.
[15:11.40]You said 10, we had far, hold on, wait, we had $50 come in too.
[15:15.88]We had 10 community subs from Wasi, 10 community subs from VertibleGiant.
[15:20.63]Thanks, both of you.
[15:21.43]And then we had 5,000 bits from BitSlave.
[15:23.51]They say, hey, Jerma, thanks to you, I got Johnny Walker.
[15:25.27]Check out the review.
[15:31.62]What Johnny Walker?
[15:32.36]Wait, what Johnny Walker did you get?
[15:34.62]That's important.
[15:35.80]Got black label?
[15:41.21]It's alright.
[15:41.57]That's pretty good.
[15:43.15]I mean, I'm a Johnny Walker Blue guy myself, but... Let's see what you think.
[15:49.87]Don't smell it!
[15:50.69]Don't smell it!
[15:51.11]Just drink it!
[15:51.81]There we go.
[15:53.55]Nice black label.
[16:00.90]Look at Mr. Fancy Pants.
[16:02.02]You buy a blue label and you drink it over the course of like five years.
[16:04.90]I'm gonna defend that in just a second here.
[16:07.76]Hold on.
[16:07.96]What do you think?
[16:09.28]Is it good?
[16:11.84]Pretty good.
[16:13.26]Pretty good.
[16:13.72]I think he liked it.
[16:15.48]895?
[16:15.50]What?
[16:32.44]895.
[16:38.29]Jeremiah 895.
[16:42.55]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[16:46.39]Liquid.
[16:46.87]Alright.
[16:47.69]First of all, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[16:49.32]I'm glad you like it.
[16:53.12]Also, Plain Dad says hi.
[16:54.38]Tell Plain Dad I said hello.
[16:57.82]Thank you.
[16:58.16]I'm glad you liked it.
[16:59.46]It's good shit.
[17:01.62]Explanation.
[17:02.18]Hold on, we'll talk about this in a second.
[17:03.27]Power Razor is a Mega Man Buster Part.
[17:06.03]Attaching Buster Parts allows you to power up your Buster Gun.
[17:09.45]You can attach Buster Parts by pressing the start button to go to the menu and delete equipment from the Buster.
[17:13.27]Buster Parts.
[17:25.87]Why is there nothing here?
[17:28.97]Oh.
[17:29.67]Attack.
[17:30.43]Plus one attack.
[17:31.63]Sick.
[17:33.35]Oh, I love it already.
[17:35.85]I love it already.
[17:36.87]It's already equipped.
[17:41.53]Let's get out.
[17:46.43]Lookit, it's a little bigger too.
[17:49.85]Nice.
[17:50.33]I wouldn't have even found that if I didn't go down the right hallway.
[17:55.30]Anything else?
[17:55.78]No.
[17:56.82]How do I get a big view of the map?
[17:59.57]Select.
[18:00.84]And they thought, look at how far... Look at fucking Capcom, you know what I mean?
[18:10.44]Is there a door over here that I could have gone in?
[18:14.72]No.
[18:15.22]Just didn't explore it.
[18:17.56]Oh, Capcom does it again.
[18:24.13]There's a blue door over here, but... Oh, no, I got... Right, the plasma.
[18:27.55]Mega Man, I'm showing a large blip in front of you.
[18:30.73]It's probably a Reaverbot.
[18:32.34]Uh-oh.
[18:33.30]Be careful.
[18:35.06]Huh?
[18:36.02]Mega Man, can you hear me?
[18:37.62]Uh-oh.
[18:39.42]I'm losing you.
[18:40.86]The transmission's breaking.
[18:43.94]Roll, are you alright?
[18:46.33]Can you hear me?
[18:48.29]That's not a bad Mega Man.
[18:49.49]That's not a bad Mega Man at all.
[18:57.44]Boss battle!
[19:08.38]How do I do the dodge?
[19:23.99]There's no dodge roll?
[19:24.85]Oh yeah, there is.
[19:25.75]I did it a few times already.
[19:29.49]Holy shit, he's going nuts.
[19:38.74]Do I have to be locked on first?
[19:44.96]I don't even need it.
[19:50.29]Yeah, you can lock on.
[19:52.99]You don't have to lock on, though.
[19:54.25]It goes in the direction that you're aiming to whatever enemy is there.
[20:08.68]Why no helmet?
[20:15.88]He's protecting everything on his whole body except for his head, the most important part.
[20:31.46]You can get one later?
[20:32.30]Oh, alright, cool.
[20:35.52]Anyways, if you buy an expensive bottle of alcohol, like whiskey or like an expensive tequila or something, you're not supposed to drink it all in one, two, three days.
[20:48.85]You don't buy like a $300 bottle of whiskey and drink it in one day.
[20:53.83]That's a special occasion alcohol.
[21:10.10]Okay, if you buy a bottle of Jack Daniels what like who cares See ya
[21:44.64]Sponsored content.
[21:45.36]There's actually people that think that Johnny Walker Blue is disgusting and that I'm disgusting for liking it because it's... It's a blender.
[21:53.83]You are gross.
[21:55.05]You should be drinking right out of the barrel from one source.
[22:07.15]Wait, what's going on?
[22:07.77]I thought the game froze.
[22:18.17]Why does this ship look like it's flying upside down?
[22:20.09]It is.
[22:30.55]Oh.
[22:30.67]Anytime, Mega Man.
[22:37.28]I'm sorry, Mega Man.
[22:39.02]I had some engine problems, and... It's okay, Roll.
[22:43.07]Uh, Roll, we're not at work anymore.
[22:44.77]You can call me Dave.
[22:46.55]All's well that ends well, right?
[22:48.75]And we were able to get a refractor.
[22:51.31]We should be able to get by with that for a while.
[22:54.21]If only the mother load were as easy to find as this.
[22:57.57]Don't worry.
[22:58.35]We'll find it someday.
[23:00.35]Who is this guy?
[23:02.25]I can tell he's gonna be shady because he's got one of these voices that they have in every single cartoon.
[23:07.79]He's gonna be a little weird.
[23:39.51]Why don't you do something?
[23:40.67]Mega Man, what the fuck?
[23:42.59]Mega Man, go help the guy.
[24:19.40]That's why you wear a fucking helmet.
[24:21.27]Both of you.
[24:21.83]Hope this was a lesson for all three of you, actually.
[24:36.84]This looks pretty bad.
[24:39.88]I don't think it'll be safe to set foot in here for quite a while.
[24:44.52]We've been pushing her so hard.
[24:48.15]Haven't been taking good enough care of her.
[24:50.53]I can't wait for the upgrades.
[24:51.45]I'm so excited for upgrades.
[24:53.53]Who cares about the game?
[24:54.51]I just care about the numbers going up.
[24:55.89]We'll be here for a while, I guess.
[25:04.14]Sure.
[25:04.48]There's a kick.
[25:05.44]Who's this?
[25:05.74]Hi, my name's Data.
[25:34.06]But you already knew that, didn't you?
[25:36.24]I mean, we've been friends for years, right?
[25:38.98]Right, yeah.
[25:39.88]Of course I do that.
[25:41.32]Come talk to me if you want to.
[25:42.14]Oh, save.
[25:42.74]Alright, alright, alright.
[25:43.34]What do you want to do?
[25:44.28]Recharge energy.
[25:44.92]Save the game.
[25:47.74]Memory card one.
[25:57.93]Yes, I want to save.
[26:00.11]Do auto-voice.
[26:01.03]You got it.
[26:01.73]For this character, I will, I promise.
[26:05.07]Alright, we're done.
[26:08.59]Tell me.
[26:10.15]Tell me.
[26:10.73]What can I help... What can I help you with?
[26:14.57]Uh, no, I don't need... This is, like, tutorial info.
[26:19.01]Okay, so, uh, I got a map here.
[26:20.84]This is a big place.
[26:23.62]Let's go to the... Let's go to the market.
[26:25.12]Let's just go this way.
[26:29.72]To town.
[26:30.92]That's a pretty good Minecraft sign.
[26:45.80]What's going on?
[26:48.02]The police are here.
[26:54.46]Can I... Police?
[26:56.46]Oh, there they are.
[26:59.36]What's the matter?
[26:59.80]Glad to see you're alright after the crash.
[27:19.40]Okay, bye.
[27:22.11]Secrets.
[27:24.27]Always check for secrets so I can kick trees or something.
[27:28.67]Do a Trump voice instead.
[27:29.95]You know, I love how the court of chat's opinion on the Trump voice has increased.
[27:39.15]Remember when I first did the Trump voice and everyone was like, oh, no, no, Stephen Colbert does a better job.
[27:46.36]I did it like five or six more times, and now it gets requested.
[27:56.16]I want to go down inside the ruins to look for some... Am I too loud?
[27:59.84]Why do I feel like I'm loud right now?
[28:05.54]Am I loud?
[28:07.80]No?
[28:08.48]I'm good?
[28:08.82]Okay.
[28:12.75]Fine, okay.
[28:13.85]Look, there's some parts and other stuff, but I'm afraid of Regrobots and whatever else might be down there.
[28:19.84]But if I don't find something to sell in my shop, I'll be in trouble.
[28:27.24]Go in it, and why just looking inside?
[28:29.96]What do you have to say?
[28:33.67]Is this your ship?
[28:35.19]It shouldn't be here.
[28:36.03]This is a no parking zone.
[28:37.33]It ain't mine.
[28:43.72]This gate's malfunctioning.
[28:45.56]We can't get it to lock.
[28:48.02]We'd better fix it soon.
[28:53.36]Were you in the flying machine that just crash landed?
[28:57.31]If so, could you wait until you've spoken with the inspector before entering the city?
[29:01.63]I believe the inspector's gone to investigate the crash site.
[29:05.49]I tried.
[29:06.27]He didn't say anything.
[29:08.43]What?
[29:11.64]Oh, here's the little Lego guys.
[29:23.31]If we don't leave soon, we're going to the parking lot.
[29:35.97]We're ready for this time.
[29:37.27]Oh, there's a shitload of reverb on this.
[29:42.15]Hold on.
[29:42.61]Why is there so much reverb?
[29:51.87]That one's loud.
[29:55.54]Those are tuber voices.
[29:59.16]Come on.
[29:59.56]If I have access to it, do you think I'm not going to use it sometimes?
[30:07.41]If I have access to... I know.
[30:09.45]I know that everybody that has one of these does this shit.
[30:13.27]But if it can put a little bit of a robotic tune to my voice when there's a robot on the screen, I'm going to enhance my volume and my data that I'm putting through to the stream.
[30:27.64]Well, you certainly put on quite a show, but it looks like everyone's all... How do I do this?
[30:31.97]Alright, well, talk to me.
[30:37.16]Isn't this the inspector?
[30:41.06]Talk to the inspector?
[30:41.90]What the heck?
[30:47.47]Ah, Mega Man.
[30:48.91]The police saw us crash land and came to check up on us.
[30:52.99]Well, you certainly put on quite a show.
[30:56.33]That was close.
[30:56.75]That was in the same ballpark.
[30:59.68]Let me welcome you to Cadillac's Island.
[31:05.16]Now, I'd like to ask one of you to come with me to the station.
[31:10.82]Oh, Bernie voice.
[31:12.46]Another Bernie voice, Jerma.
[31:13.90]Can you do anything besides a Bernie voice?
[31:17.10]It's not me.
[31:20.34]Don't worry.
[31:22.33]It won't take very long.
[31:24.97]While you're waiting, you can spend your time in the shopping arcade next to the city.
[31:32.03]You don't need an ID card to get in there.
[31:36.01]Are you ready to go, Professor?
[31:41.82]Go to the arcade?
[31:42.68]Are you fucking kidding me?
[31:46.72]How much is the arcade?
[31:48.40]And why is this the best game ever?
[32:04.66]Ditched.
[32:07.48]Wait, did they...
[32:09.39]So, wait, me and Roll were left behind.
[32:11.93]So they deemed the save game little monkey character more important than me?
[32:18.21]I can understand, like, Grandpa, he's the guy, he's the one that has to repair the ship and has to give a police report.
[32:34.70]But what's the save monkey doing there?
[32:40.32]What's this?
[32:44.96]Oh, that was cool.
[32:45.78]Alright, hold on.
[32:49.78]This is kind of bright.
[32:55.49]Failure?
[32:59.01]Tailor?
[32:59.79]Oh, let's go in.
[33:05.62]I can put new clothes?
[33:06.88]That customer there spends all his time staring at the mirror and never buys anything.
[33:16.00]Look at me!
[33:16.98]Am I cool or what?
[33:18.95]Yes, you are.
[33:19.77]Yep.
[33:20.41]Yes, so far the coolest character in the game so far.
[33:22.75]I don't know what this guy's problem is.
[33:24.43]You should let him stay as long as he wants.
[33:39.24]This is Apple Market, the biggest shopping center on Catalox Island.
[33:44.57]Why is it called Apple Market?
[33:46.71]See those banners up there?
[33:49.35]When you want to look up or down, push the directional button while holding down the R2 button.
[34:00.11]It's called the Apple Market because you decided to have banners that say Apple on them with an apple.
[34:08.18]Not like this town is known for its apples in farming market.
[34:11.80]No.
[34:12.70]We... We just decided it was gonna be an apple on a banner.
[34:16.09]That's interesting.
[34:19.53]Oh, are you one of the people who just crash-landed?
[34:21.35]Want some fruit?
[34:23.07]How about some fresh vegetables?
[34:24.25]Alright, no, here we go.
[34:25.37]Yeah, I do.
[34:26.39]I want them.
[34:27.37]Cabbage, mushrooms, carrots.
[34:29.21]There's a lot of vegetables lined up.
[34:34.55]There are tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables lined up.
[34:36.81]Where's the fucking meat?
[34:41.04]Where's the meat and cheese?
[34:47.24]Dressmaker hip bone.
[34:52.87]There's no apples there.
[34:56.47]Say, you're kind of cute.
[34:57.51]Your name's Mega Man, isn't it?
[35:00.85]You're my type of man.
[35:02.21]I don't know if you like looking at women's clothing, but come back and see me anytime.
[35:08.54]That was a little forward.
[35:13.49]Like a high welcome to town would have been nice at first.
[35:19.15]I really like this dress.
[35:20.69]Do you think it would look good on me?
[35:22.01]Yeah, I mean, sure.
[35:29.34]Really?
[35:29.66]Will you buy it for me then?
[35:34.94]Who are these people?
[35:36.44]Who are you fucking people?
[35:38.14]No!
[35:39.28]Oh, don't worry.
[35:39.78]I was just kidding.
[35:44.93]Hi, Mega Man.
[35:45.45]Welcome to town.
[35:45.97]I love you.
[35:46.41]Okay.
[35:48.63]Mega Man, do you think this looks good?
[35:49.63]Buy it for me.
[35:50.33]What the fuck?
[35:50.91]Who are these two people?
[35:51.85]Get out of here.
[35:55.54]They must know I'm famous.
[35:57.88]They think I'm loaded.
[35:58.84]Is Mega Man loaded?
[35:59.34]Probably.
[36:02.24]Probably.
[36:05.35]I mean, this is like late Mega Man, right?
[36:11.09]He's like 22 or 25 or something, isn't he, in this game?
[36:15.28]He's probably got like 10 million in the bank.
[36:20.76]Have you heard about the ruins just outside the gate?
[36:24.44]You can go inside even if you don't have a digger's license.
[36:28.68]I hear the junk shop owner next door is always going in there looking for parts.
[36:32.76]We have our grind missions.
[36:34.00]That's pretty cool.
[36:35.76]What do you got here for me?
[36:37.01]You have any fucking cheddar cheese?
[36:38.91]My favorite cheese.
[36:41.43]This is my dog, Paprika.
[36:43.43]He's cute, isn't he?
[36:45.57]Yeah, he is.
[36:48.61]That reminds me of Pato.
[36:50.14]I fucking love dogs.
[36:55.26]It's a box.
[36:56.22]Is there anything inside?
[36:57.22]There's a refractor shard inside.
[36:59.80]You found a hundred zenny.
[37:02.67]Somebody just threw $100 away.
[37:04.67]Why?
[37:04.94]It's a garbage pill.
[37:08.78]There's a refractive shard inside.
[37:10.30]You found 20 as any.
[37:11.52]Excuse me.
[37:16.21]This is my dumpster.
[37:19.14]Anything inside.
[37:19.76]It's empty.
[37:20.25]Alright.
[37:22.19]Alright.
[37:22.61]Um, cool.
[37:23.75]This is a nice little area.
[37:25.65]Did I not do anything?
[37:26.81]Wait, there's like... Oh, toys.
[37:29.13]Wait, hold on.
[37:30.67]Yeah, of course.
[37:31.11]I didn't do the entire right side of the mall.
[37:36.16]They're trying to fix inflation.
[37:37.22]Leave that shit in the trash.
[37:40.54]Broken cleaner.
[37:44.10]What?
[37:45.14]How do you find items?
[37:47.95]Who are these people?
[37:50.92]There's been a lot of strangers coming here lately.
[37:54.26]Makes me nervous.
[37:54.92]I don't like strangers.
[38:25.24]Yeah, you don't look like you're from around here either.
[38:27.74]Go away.
[38:28.20]What if I wasn't here?
[38:38.26]Record shop?
[38:40.11]What is this?
[38:40.47]There's a listening station where you can listen to CDs.
[38:45.25]Can I find CDs and play them?
[38:47.93]Boy, this song is really good.
[38:49.45]What OST are you listening to?
[38:52.15]What OST is he listening to?
[38:56.15]There's a jazz CD on the player.
[38:58.19]Remember we talked about jazz yesterday?
[39:10.68]In Jerma, not all music is OST.
[39:23.31]But all music in a video game is an OST.
[39:26.42]Because it's part of the game's OST.
[39:28.80]For instance, this song we're listening to right now is on the Mega Man Legends OST.
[39:42.80]I wanted to get a CD, but I didn't have enough money.
[39:44.62]So I'm just going to listen to the samples.
[39:47.40]Oh my god, I remember this!
[39:50.17]Alright, some of you guys that are old enough, do you remember going into the record store?
[39:54.54]The CD store and being able to listen to like an 8 second sample of the CD?
[40:00.40]Wow.
[40:01.12]They had these headphones that were lined up on the cases of the CDs and you could listen to samples.
[40:07.21]I forgot about that.
[40:10.10]And it was always so stupid.
[40:11.16]I fucking hated it so much.
[40:12.26]Because every time you scanned one to play a sample from the album or from a single, it would pick a random spot.
[40:19.84]It wouldn't play the bridge or the chorus.
[40:23.69]But you'd have an insanely famous song and it would play like in the middle of the second verse.
[40:29.61]It's like, I want to fucking give me the chorus.
[40:34.11]Not that.
[40:34.49]What are you doing?
[40:39.89]You caught me right in the middle of your second verse.
[40:41.87]That's not what I wanted to hear.
[40:42.71]That's a bad sample.
[40:48.01]Be sure to listen to our sample CDs before you leave.
[40:50.11]Alright, where's the arcade?
[41:02.10]I'll spend an hour walking around here.
[41:03.58]I don't care.
[41:04.36]I love this.
[41:05.60]Electronic goods store.
[41:06.94]It's an electronic shop.
[41:08.44]But the junk store probably has a better selection of parts.
[41:13.61]Yeah, but what's in it, though?
[41:18.89]50% off a TV.
[41:20.69]Can I buy this stuff?
[41:24.25]It's a TV, but it's too big to carry home.
[41:26.01]That's not too big to carry home.
[41:28.08]What?
[41:31.18]What?
[41:33.10]you can definitely alright if you can carry a 24 pack of water to your car you can carry that to your car mega man please what else is in here it's a VCR but you don't need one I already got one oh it's a Tesla fridge it's a refrigerator
[42:03.00]What do you do?
[42:04.12]Parts for a flying ship?
[42:05.72]You're better off looking at the junk store.
[42:10.30]All this stuff in here is junk.
[42:12.48]Everything's 50% off.
[42:15.12]You got nothing full-priced in here, man.
[42:16.72]You're selling an old fridge for like 30 fucking percent off.
[42:19.16]Give me a break.
[42:22.09]Toy store, yep.
[42:24.15]This is that new game called Mega Man Legends.
[42:27.35]It looks pretty interesting.
[42:30.09]Can I play the game within the game?
[42:37.68]Alright, junk shop.
[42:38.54]Where's the arcade?
[42:39.48]Empty.
[42:48.74]Ego Maniac.
[42:49.78]Oh, man.
[42:52.16]This is not even a... Alright, this is a lost and found.
[42:54.96]This is not even a junk shop.
[42:59.57]That's condescending Yeah, sure
[43:19.93]You will?
[43:20.29]Oh, thank you so much.
[43:21.75]You'll probably find him somewhere near the entrance.
[43:24.29]He's really just a big coward, you see.
[43:26.61]So I don't think he's gone too far in.
[43:28.97]Alright.
[43:30.05]What do you have here?
[43:32.56]He's 100% dead.
[43:34.62]That's a stuffed re-robot.
[43:36.34]It's an old family heirloom.
[43:38.02]We call it Rover.
[43:44.40]Alright.
[43:44.98]Let's go find the junk guy.
[43:51.40]Alright, no arcade?
[43:52.98]Where's the arcade?
[43:55.00]Look at how happy the dog is.
[43:58.19]Oh, I know somebody that, like, just got out of the bath.
[44:01.83]You just took a bath.
[44:04.15]Yep.
[44:05.69]The only difference is you're not, like, rolling around on your back and going... Alright, so we need to go to the... Alright, let's get out of here.
[44:25.92]Can I throw this away?
[44:33.42]Can I open the garbage and throw it away?
[44:39.05]Wait, there's $50 in here?
[44:40.45]Alright, kick it in the basket.
[44:44.25]Oh, whatever.
[44:52.42]I love the way this... Look at this.
[44:54.30]What?
[44:56.73]I love it.
[44:58.39]I just saw an older man go inside those ruins over there.
[45:00.49]I wonder if he'll be alright.
[45:02.25]If you want to go check on him, you should probably save first.
[45:07.21]If you want to save, just talk to me, okay?
[45:10.04]Okay.
[45:11.98]I forgot.
[45:12.32]I know I forgot.
[45:24.62]A man of five voices.
[45:26.94]He can go like this.
[45:28.10]He can go like this.
[45:30.00]He can go like this.
[45:31.26]He can go like this.
[45:32.70]The man of five voices.
[45:39.79]Alright, the ruins.
[45:40.41]Let's go in the ruins.
[45:49.37]Where are the ruins?
[45:52.08]The ruins over there.
[45:53.08]Uh...
[45:57.13]Over here?
[45:57.51]Isn't this the guy's store?
[45:58.95]I thought this was the guy's store.
[46:05.36]Oh, man's voice.
[46:06.38]Help!
[46:06.80]Somebody help!
[46:18.49]Dungeon time.
[46:22.17]Looking for parts too.
[46:23.03]I need junk parts.
[46:34.85]Ooh, easy.
[46:41.19]Can I move when I'm locked on?
[46:44.83]I can't move when I'm locked on, huh?
[46:47.87]Alright, let's get this money.
[47:01.87]Alright, so if I move... Okay, I can't move left and right.
[47:05.33]Is it like a dodge or like a... That's kick.
[47:09.86]R2.
[47:11.20]Left, up, down.
[47:12.24]No.
[47:12.92]No.
[47:16.80]How do I do that dodge?
[47:29.42]Am I playing the worst Mega Man?
[47:31.50]What?
[47:33.17]What?
[47:37.91]What?
[47:39.13]Hold on.
[47:39.53]Dude, that's like I'm eating my favorite spaghetti dish in my favorite restaurant.
[47:46.75]And you walk up as somebody that's never been to the restaurant before.
[47:51.07]Or maybe you have, and you don't like it, but you tap me on the shoulder, you go, hey, the spaghetti here sucks, it's the worst, the meat sauce is terrible.
[47:57.23]In fact, I think there's rats in the kitchen, and then you leave.
[47:59.19]Wait, what?
[48:06.60]Help me!
[48:07.22]Where is this guy?
[48:12.56]There's gotta be a way I can do that dodge.

[49:42.79]What did I do?
[49:43.27]I didn't do anything!
[49:53.40]There he is.
[49:56.43]Missed a secret?
[49:57.01]Don't worry, I ain't going anywhere.

[50:06.43]Phew!
[50:08.95]Thank you, uh, Mr. Blue Boy.
[50:13.17]Come on by my junk shop.
[50:15.13]I'll give you some thing as a token of my appreciation.
[50:18.98]If you don't know what you did, it's worse.
[50:22.42]Is this about the, like, yes thing?
[50:24.90]Don't worry about me.
[50:25.79]If nothing else, I'm a fast runner and I'll make it out okay.
[50:35.87]No, I ain't saying sorry.
[50:38.43]No, I ain't saying sorry for that one.
[50:41.49]Not gonna happen.
[50:46.53]Let's go get the secrets.
[50:47.88]You didn't do anything wrong.
[50:49.14]Yeah, what did I do that was wrong?
[50:55.71]Oh, oh no.
[50:56.79]-2.
[50:57.73]Unbased streamer.
[51:06.36]Unbased.
[51:09.22]I gotta find, let's look, I gotta look for some secrets.
[51:13.14]Any secrets?
[51:13.69]Secret?
[51:22.87]Secret?
[51:26.60]There's a hole in the wall.
[51:32.94]Is there anything inside?
[51:34.72]You found a refractor shard.
[51:36.39]You got 20 youth.
[51:37.17]That's a lot of money.
[51:44.59]It looks like binding with Isaac.
[51:48.75]I gotta get up there.
[51:52.32]How do I get up there?
[51:53.70]Like, is there, like, zoom shoes?
[51:56.12]Zoomer shoes or something?
[51:58.33]Like, jump shoes?
[52:03.95]I don't think I can get up there.
[52:04.75]Alright, well, let's go with the actual exit.
[52:17.42]I got money now.
[52:26.80]Boss?
[52:28.18]Oh wait, hold on.
[52:29.22]Easy.
[52:32.10]Oh, it's the classic Mega Man villain.
[52:34.33]I'm not going to do anything until you get too close.
[52:36.85]And then I'm going to come up and I'm going to have a... Yep.
[52:39.85]Oh my god.
[52:40.35]Did I get the money?
[53:03.31]Nice.
[53:04.01]Wait, what's that?
[53:05.63]Nothing?
[53:07.99]The sound design is dope.
[53:09.74]Yeah, it actually is pretty good.
[53:11.10]Is it gonna blow stuff up?
[53:13.42]Ow.
[53:16.20]That hurt.
[53:31.52]Hitbox fucking... Hitbox, Reddit, whatever it is.
[53:34.30]Is there only one guy in here?
[53:38.99]No, there's two.
[53:46.75]Ow.
[53:47.22]Fuck.
[53:47.46]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[53:51.56]This is a tough room.
[53:55.24]Does that guy move?
[53:58.23]Alright, let's get this cheesed.
[54:04.87]Ah!
[54:05.83]Okay, that's done.
[54:09.10]Now just get in.
[54:11.18]Let's fight.
[54:21.75]Don't stop saying Reddit shit.
[54:25.89]What?
[54:40.23]Unbased.
[54:44.30]Ooh, that was a good chest move he predicted.
[54:46.46]He just walked into the wall though.
[54:55.10]Big money.
[55:01.87]Zero out of ten.
[55:04.03]Unbased.
[55:08.51]Oh, yeah.
[55:11.42]Rapid Fire.
[55:13.36]Rapid Fire is a Mega Man buster part.
[55:15.00]Attaching buster parts allows you to power up your weapons.
[55:18.34]You can attach buster parts by pressing the start button to go to the menu screen and selecting equip from the buster parts menu.
[55:25.76]I think I stayed in here.
[55:27.95]So I can have two on.
[55:29.05]Equip.
[55:31.37]Rapid Fire.
[55:31.99]Increases rapid.
[55:34.35]They can have two parts on at the same time.
[55:35.61]So I have... Ooh, let's take a look.
[55:38.85]How much better is it?
[55:49.33]It's a little better.
[55:49.79]Oh, we'll test it on you.
[55:52.07]You can get at least three.
[56:02.89]Yeah, eventually, probably.
[56:05.30]I don't remember much from the game.
[56:07.58]Besides, that was good that I got... Alright, anything else in here?
[56:10.26]No.
[56:11.10]Leave the runes.
[56:13.46]You can strafe while locked on.
[56:14.78]You cannot.
[56:16.41]You cannot.
[56:16.93]I believe that is... Somebody said that is only in Mega Man Legends 2.
[56:24.07]Yes, you can.
[56:24.67]What are you talking about?
[56:30.64]Are you sure that's not a suit upgrade or something I get later?
[56:41.14]Remember, it was a- it was- they were- they're- they're- they're japing you.
[56:45.78]Jabate.
[57:02.47]Ooh, big door!
[57:03.47]There's a wall in the way.
[57:05.07]Maybe if you had something to break through it with.
[57:09.97]Worth a shot.
[57:14.34]I got money, and I just rescued the guy, so... What else is there?
[57:18.69]Nothing?
[57:19.23]Nothing?
[57:19.67]I can't get up there?
[57:22.93]Come on.
[57:26.87]No!
[57:27.45]Oh well.
[57:40.16]Mega small.
[57:42.63]Does Jerma know his facecam is on?
[57:44.65]What the fuck, dude?
[57:46.21]Use the ladder?
[57:46.85]We need a ladder.
[57:47.51]Ladder?
[58:06.52]In the other room?
[58:07.92]Wait, what?
[58:11.18]Oh, am I getting lied to?
[58:12.56]The ladder in the first room.
[58:19.00]Wait, what?
[58:24.92]Oh, that's a ladder.
[58:27.32]Oh, that's a ladder.
[58:29.72]I thought that was just cool artwork.
[58:31.23]I didn't know that was a ladder.
[58:32.51]It was like, alright, here we go.
[58:33.59]I'm back.
[58:37.31]Hey, look at this.
[58:38.89]It looks like Spotter's car.
[58:42.68]I wonder if it would run if we would fix it up Probably This dude is just vibing
[59:09.62]He hates the auto voice.
[59:11.18]No, I will.
[59:11.82]I just keep forgetting.
[59:18.25]Back to the junk store.
[59:19.93]Wait, another person here?
[59:44.74]Where do I kick this?
[59:45.42]Somebody said behind the counter.
[59:53.20]Behind the bakery counter?
[59:54.26]Is that real?
[59:54.70]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[59:58.78]Get it behind the bakery counter.
[60:13.19]Wow, you must really hate this place.
[60:22.39]You look like a Slytherin.
[60:25.79]Yes, I know.
[60:27.23]I know.
[60:27.57]I look like a Slytherin.
[60:28.73]And if I tell you I'm Slytherin, that means I'm actually Hufflepuff.
[60:32.41]And if I get Hufflepuff on a test, it means I'm actually Slytherin in real life.
[60:36.89]That's how this works.
[60:41.59]Got it!
[60:44.18]Nice shot!
[60:44.82]Thousands, Emi!

[61:48.91]Do you see that old beat-up car?
[61:51.15]Outside the city walls?
[61:52.81]That's the car we used as our support car.
[61:55.83]when we were younger anyway you can have it if you want doesn't run anymore but you should be able to use it to exchange buster parts and stuff like storage it's a stash you're looking for parts for your ship right oh I don't have anything like that here but I've got weapons and upgrades and other stuff I can sell you why why are you the store that has all this stuff um what did you say your name was

[62:29.26]Well, anyway, come back soon, Mr. Hippopotamus.
[62:38.22]Only you guys know.
[62:45.59]Oh, I was the digger and he was my spotter.
[62:49.99]I'm back to buy something.
[62:58.09]Arts for a flying ship.
[62:59.29]I want to buy... You told me to come back and buy something.
[63:06.00]If you got a Class B digger's license, you can get into the ruins in the southern forest.
[63:13.32]Or the one up the north in the closer woods.
[63:16.30]Alright, well, thanks for nothing.
[63:21.01]Are we just being polite?
[63:22.83]Hey, hey, hey, slow.

[63:26.37]No running.
[63:28.77]You're gonna slip and fall in the pool.
[63:30.55]You know how wet it is around the edges?
[63:32.47]God, people just don't ever fucking understand that rule.
[63:37.82]Who are you?
[63:39.68]Are you a digger?
[63:41.02]I'm here going, doing research on the ruins of this island here.
[63:44.62]Sure are a lot of them, aren't there?
[63:45.94]That's where I used to go.
[63:50.65]They were just being polite.
[63:52.93]You don't have any stuff here.
[63:59.35]Well... Okay.
[64:04.87]Come on up north.
[64:07.05]Uh-huh.
[64:08.99]Thanks for nothing.

[64:13.02]Yeah.
[64:16.76]Okay.
[64:17.10]Goodbye.
[64:19.64]We sell parts and upgrades and armor.
[64:21.38]Come back.
[64:23.12]Whatever.
[64:26.46]Alright.
[64:26.76]Now... Let's go turn that car on.
[64:40.49]I've got parts.
[64:45.27]Do you need to do it?
[64:45.87]Voice acting.
[64:46.13]Cutscene.
[64:49.24]That might take a while.
[64:49.98]Which means...
[65:09.45]I don't know if, uh... That's what the man at the junk store told me.
[65:14.75]Because info you should really go off of for much.
[65:18.46]Mega Man, um... Junk store man... You're really putting a lot of weight on the junk store man stuff and the things he says.
[65:25.26]Have you talked to the mayor yet?
[65:40.02]This weapon lets you use landmines.
[65:42.95]Just drop them in front of an oncoming enemy and boom!
[65:47.29]Just remember, there's a limited number of mines, so make sure you use them sparingly.
[65:53.39]Do you want me to explain what this weapon does again?
[65:57.75]I'll get to work on fixing this car up.
[66:00.80]I'll be able to help you out and maybe spot for you if I can get it running again.
[66:04.68]Ooh.
[66:08.40]Item development.
[66:10.84]Once the support card is fixed, I'll be able to use it to make all sorts of new things.
[66:15.38]If you find something interesting, bring it here.
[66:16.90]You never know what I might be able to make for you.
[66:19.30]Alright, let's... Yeah, we get, like, mobile development.
[66:21.82]More stuff to give.
[66:35.48]Wow, I only had to walk around for 10 minutes.
[66:40.35]Of course, there are some gates that can't be opened, but... Why's that?
[66:48.07]Citizenship.
[66:49.81]We've received information that indicates there are some headed this way.
[66:54.79]So as a precaution, we're evacuating the civilians and locking the gates.
[67:01.15]Pirates?
[67:02.78]Evacuating?
[67:03.92]Our grandfather is still inside the city.
[67:06.84]Will he be alright?
[67:09.60]Well, I'm sure he's heard the announcements about the pirates.
[67:13.28]Ooh, that's not yes.
[67:16.46]That's not yes.
[67:17.86]If you'll excuse me.
[67:23.68]I'm worried about Gramps.
[67:26.33]I hope he'll be okay.
[67:29.07]I'll go look for him.
[67:30.35]You wait here.
[67:31.58]We're evacuating the city?
[67:34.06]Pirates, eh?
[67:41.00]Well, they shouldn't give you any trouble.
[67:44.16]But be careful anyway, okay?
[67:46.66]I did it.
[67:49.08]I did it.
[67:49.42]I did it.
[67:50.20]That was perfect.
[67:56.64]I thought this was a Canadian forest.
[68:06.04]Let's go So I have my my citizen's key card now I can it doesn't look like much of an evacuation Hey, we're having a secret meeting get out of here If I'm careful, I should be able to get close without them noticing
[68:34.47]You can move slowly by pressing circle and the directional button at the same time.
[68:48.16]Is this sneaking or is this more pronounced than what I was just doing?
[68:55.84]That's like the get-the-fuck-out-of-my-way walk.
[68:58.23]Whisper, whisper.
[68:59.77]That girl looks suspicious, I tell you.
[69:03.66]Hey, someone's spying on us!
[69:05.38]It's that blue guy again!
[69:06.16]Come on everybody, let's go!
[69:36.63]Okay, got it?
[69:38.85]Once the decision's made, there's no turning back.
[69:41.71]The pirate?
[69:42.31]Nothing less than 100%.
[69:43.65]And remember, it's more than just guns and ships.
[69:47.85]Holy shit.
[69:48.79]It's whoever has the most information that wins, right?
[69:53.13]That's where they got the entire idea from.
[69:54.49]We understand.
[69:56.33]You need to keep your costs and risks as low as possible and stay on schedule.
[70:04.30]And they just scrambled all the dialog so they can just localize it for free everywhere.
[70:09.30]Holy shit.
[70:11.23]Genius.
[70:15.07]Wait, was that me?
[70:24.08]I thought I was a camera.
[70:31.64]Wait, you just drew- Hey, pay attention!
[70:36.48]I was in a fucking crosswalk!
[70:45.06]Is nobody driving these cars?
[70:49.44]Kick mailbox, kick mailbox.
[70:53.97]It's a mailbox, but you don't need to send any letters.
[70:58.85]I bet you the cop does it too.
[71:00.31]Do they crash into each other?
[71:01.51]Uh-oh, big school bus.
[71:06.65]Haven't you heard about the pirates?
[71:08.54]Everyone in town's evacuating.
[71:10.38]You'd be small.
[71:11.56]Okay, that's why everyone's trying.
[71:13.20]Everyone's getting fucked up.
[71:14.14]I get it.
[71:26.62]I know everyone's afraid and wants to get away.
[71:28.99]But they should be more careful when they drive.
[71:31.55]You better watch out too and make sure you don't get run over.
[71:34.83]I know.
[71:38.02]Oh my god.
[71:38.98]It's a fire hydrant.
[71:47.10]You could probably jump on top of it.
[71:57.57]Okay.
[71:58.31]And... Why did I do that?
[72:05.26]Garbage pail.
[72:05.98]Is there anything inside?
[72:07.50]No.
[72:09.84]Achievement.

[73:40.50]Mega Man, watch out for the car.
[73:43.12]The audio is desynced on me or on the game?
[73:45.02]Because I could probably fix it.

[76:32.92]Wow, this is really bright.
[76:38.24]It's a fountain.
[76:38.92]Watching it makes you feel very relaxed.

[76:44.16]Wouldn't this kill me?
[76:48.98]I've got like 400 pounds of electricity on me.
[76:53.58]The bank.
[77:00.96]There's a bank.
[77:01.66]The pirates aren't coming, are they?
[77:03.94]Please say they're not.
[77:06.67]ATM It's an automated teller machine, but you can't use it.
[77:10.85]You don't have any money in the bank.
[77:12.92]Well, let's go.
[77:13.42]Let's open up an account It's getting too dangerous here.
[77:17.38]I'm thinking that maybe we should shut down temporarily This is the bank planning on evacuating.
[77:23.40]Please be sure to withdraw money first No, don't tell everyone to withdraw their money first.
[77:28.54]That's how you crash the whole economy The desk filling up forms Pens are attached to the desk by a chain
[77:39.26]Why are you telling me how much money you have?
[77:45.52]Wait, he can't take it out?
[78:10.50]Alright, at that point, I'm gonna be like, alright, hey, dude, here's a 20.
[78:14.45]Just put it in.
[78:15.51]And then take it out.
[78:20.47]Have a nice day.
[78:21.75]What?
[78:25.15]Knock, knock.
[78:27.17]Looks like nobody's home.
[78:36.70]The legendary mega... Oh, yeah.
[78:46.38]Know what's on the other side of this gate?
[78:48.98]The Yas Plains.
[78:50.32]The Yas Plains.
[78:52.62]That's what... Right now it's full of people who've evacuated from the city, so it's a little crowded.
[79:15.18]Oh, chat.
[79:16.91]Chat.
[79:17.89]What are you gonna say about that one?
[79:20.05]I wonder.
[79:20.53]This fucking music never ends.
[79:29.12]It's just standard default background, you're in town music.
[79:34.42]Alright, city hall.
[79:35.18]Let's go to city hall.
[79:48.47]Is there anything else up here that I need to do that I didn't do?
[79:50.39]That's my favorite part.
[80:00.57]It's coming up right now.
[80:14.79]We got City Hall downtown.
[80:16.69]Where should I be going?
[80:18.64]The pirates are attacking.
[80:24.30]Where are the pirates attacking from?
[80:29.18]You're such a fucking elf.
[80:33.65]Big building.
[80:37.21]Police.
[80:37.61]Let's go to the police station.
[80:49.98]Holy shit, this game looks like shit.
[80:53.24]This game came out before you were born, probably.
[80:57.82]This game came out before you were even alive.
[81:01.43]It looks different from the ones in the downtown area.
[81:13.02]This game came out in like 1998.
[81:13.82]You were born in 1999.
[81:24.32]It looks pretty good for coming out in 1999.
[81:27.70]I'm not here to spy.
[81:30.18]No, not me.
[81:37.77]With these pirates running around, I'm glad we have such a well-trained police force.
[81:42.51]What's in the news?
[81:43.19]It's a newspaper.
[81:44.55]Let's see what it says.
[81:46.27]Flying ship crashes in forest.
[81:47.63]No injuries reported.
[81:48.45]That's the last article.
[81:51.14]Not much happens here.
[81:53.70]No matter how brave those pirates might be, they wouldn't attack the police station.
[81:58.02]Would they?
[81:58.42]I don't know.
[82:01.67]Turns out your grandfather, Professor Barrel, is an old friend of the mayor's.
[82:06.17]I didn't know he was such a renowned archaeologist.
[82:11.75]Chad is getting toxic.
[82:12.81]Can we have sub only mode?
[82:13.87]Turn it off.
[82:15.29]Turn it off.
[82:16.72]Our job as police officers is to serve and protect.
[82:24.41]People have catalogued islands.
[82:36.25]Only authorized personnel are allowed inside the office.
[82:38.51]I don't have a citizen card for this shit.
[82:51.68]Oh, they're cheating.
[82:52.66]They're using...
[82:54.27]only authorized chat only or you gotta pay channel points oh man city hall is this a church or is this city hall this is a church uh oh sorry no unauthorized entry allowed do you have a business here suddenly it's meaningless
[83:24.57]He's in a meeting with the mayor.
[83:25.67]Please wait one minute.
[83:29.54]Alright, turn it off.
[83:30.18]Turn it off.
[83:30.60]Turn it off.
[83:30.94]Turn it off.
[83:31.32]Turn it off.
[83:31.72]Turn it off.
[83:32.18]Turn it off.
[83:32.54]Turn it off.
[83:33.28]Turn it off.
[83:34.16]No, no.
[83:34.46]Keep it on.
[83:34.78]Keep it on.
[83:35.11]Keep it on.
[83:35.59]Make him waste all that points so I don't have to wink.
[83:37.45]Keep it on.
[83:37.75]Keep it on.
[83:38.59]Make him waste all that points so I don't have to wink ever again.
[83:46.68]hey mega man come to check up on me eh yes here let me introduce you to the mayor of this island amelia I'm amelia nice to meet you I'm an old friend of professor barrels I worked as his assistant for a while while I was in school
[84:10.56]I don't have a fucking backpack on.
[84:12.22]It's a small world, isn't it?
[84:14.23]To tell you the truth, we've gotten reports that... Keep it on.
[84:17.47]Keep on making waste on that fucking point.
[84:19.25]I was asking the professor if he might have any idea what they're after.
[84:24.37]I'll bet anything they're after the legendary treasure supposedly buried on this island.
[84:31.28]There are a lot of stories about the treasure, but no one knows exactly what it is.
[84:37.86]I thought maybe you might know something about it, professor.
[84:40.96]I mean, I'm not going to lie, that's a pretty sick creamsicle hair.
[84:43.42]I strive for that every day.
[84:44.36]Thanks for the five community subs, Atlas Starfish.
[84:47.62]Congratulations to the winners.
[84:49.34]What do you have to say?
[85:11.61]Sub only is useless.
[85:14.01]I know.
[85:15.19]Or, I mean, is it?
[85:15.93]This is a... This is my equivalent to World of Warcraft letting you level up to 60 for like $5 or $10, whatever it was.
[85:25.93]Wow, that ruined the whole game, didn't it?
[85:27.33]Holy shit.
[85:30.75]You can buy... You can pay like $10 and just level the fuck up to max level with a new character.
[85:40.69]Holy shit.
[85:41.98]I forgot about that.
[85:42.76]What did they want me to do?
[85:43.70]I was paying attention to the tyrant that I am.
[85:48.22]Very treasured is the legend that says if the seals are broken, a terrible disaster will occur.
[85:54.80]Even if it's only a legend as mayor of this island, I can't ignore anything that might threaten it.
[86:03.55]I'm going to stay here and talk with Amelia.
[86:06.01]You take care of Roll in case those pirates show up.
[86:11.64]Is there any money in the desk?
[86:15.66]Why is the chat sub only?
[86:16.96]It's a 900 million IQ play to make people waste all their fucking points.
[86:24.83]And it's working.
[86:27.35]You're from out of town, aren't you?
[86:28.31]Are you a digger?
[86:29.57]Don't worry, everyone here is very friendly.
[86:32.15]You may not know your way around yet, but you'll find that you'll get along just fine.
[86:39.65]have any problem alright I'm probably gonna get I'm gonna get cut scenes here in a second aren't I yeah there comes a cut scene it's a dog what do you mean it's a dog what's that all about
[87:16.20]Right.
[87:17.38]Who's... Am I pretending to be them, or are they pretending to be me?
[87:22.71]With the kind of stretching up on the toes thing.
[87:26.17]Do I see the adults doing that, and I'm like, yeah, I do that too?
[87:35.55]I don't know.
[87:41.48]Wow, he was trying to hit me.
[87:45.00]Alright, um, let's go back.
[87:46.34]He went around.
[87:49.72]He circled back.
[87:51.96]Hey, uh, Frank, we didn't hit that fucking kid, did we?
[87:54.85]No, no, no, no, we didn't.
[87:56.57]Turn around and fucking drill him.
[88:02.03]She's come here to check things out.
[88:04.28]I'm sure of it.
[88:04.92]Okay.
[88:05.08]Bye.
[88:05.24]Are we self-sub only on?
[88:06.00]Nice.
[88:06.24]Keep it on.
[88:06.50]What's going on over here?
[88:33.33]What did you do to upset my dog?
[88:37.03]What are you staring at?
[88:39.53]I'm not a circus clown or something.
[88:42.03]Go on, get out of here.
[88:44.83]What?
[88:48.19]What do you got?
[88:48.97]What are you doing?
[88:50.30]What are you staring at?
[88:52.12]I need to get a bone or something.
[88:54.34]I'm not a circus clown or something.
[88:56.78]Go on, get out of here.
[89:00.81]Alright, well, did I say stop?
[89:03.70]Did I give food to the dog?
[89:06.34]You don't understand.
[89:09.18]I'll translate.
[89:10.18]T-I-C-C pirate.
[89:10.56]And I'm hungry too.
[89:32.91]No, he didn't say anything after that.
[89:40.98]That was it.
[89:41.32]He just wanted to tell Mega Man that he was hungry.
[89:42.80]Holy shit.
[89:56.82]That was one of the worms from, like, Worms Armageddon.
[90:00.04]That's what they look like.
[90:00.90]I've been trying to figure it out for the longest time.
[90:02.74]I haven't said anything yet.
[90:05.72]But they have worms faces.
[90:07.56]I was like, what the fuck do they look like?
[90:10.60]I'm like the worms franchise.
[90:19.32]Sub chat is worse.
[90:21.05]Alright, turn it off!
[90:21.75]Turn it off!
[90:22.75]Sub chat is worse!
[90:24.97]Turn it off!
[90:31.34]It's a junk store.
[90:32.04]No, I want to talk to this person.
[90:36.22]Alright, now, does that mean I can buy something?
[90:38.59]Yep.
[90:49.46]Ooh, 8480 Time Currency.
[90:53.44]Whatever that is.
[90:53.98]Alright, buy.
[90:55.86]Parts.
[90:57.04]Power Razor.
[90:57.96]Ooh.
[90:59.20]Range Booster.
[91:00.56]Turbo Charger.
[91:02.98]Dude, I could get... Double Power Booster?
[91:08.66]Double Power Booster, I think I want to do.
[91:12.78]Real Wink?
[91:15.20]Why does it do that?
[91:24.52]Alright, I'm doing double power booster.
[91:28.80]Give it to me.
[91:30.53]Power booster.

[91:33.43]Adds one point to life gauge!

[91:55.84]Extra pack?
[91:57.04]Adds points to the canteen.
[91:58.34]Alright, I don't want to use all my money.

[92:40.06]Sell this shitty power razor.
[92:43.01]And equip the new one and keep the rapid fire on.
[92:50.27]Life gauge is a good buy?
[92:51.07]Yeah.
[92:53.46]You get money so easily, don't sell it.
[92:55.78]No point in selling, it's not even... Oh.
[93:00.81]Cool.
[93:01.83]Look at that.
[93:02.53]Look at that life.

[93:04.29]Alright, let me, uh... Cost of parts.
[93:07.27]Equip.
[93:08.33]Should I... Alright.
[93:09.01]Power razor?
[93:10.63]Double power razor?
[93:12.23]Just have a ton of attack?
[93:13.85]Or should I... I think I'm gonna keep that on.
[93:16.79]No.
[93:19.26]Double power.
[93:21.26]The rapid fire is not that fast.
[93:28.44]Each person that says this game sucks, I'd like for you to delete their account.
[93:33.24]You guys have that capability?
[93:34.04]Mods, can you do that?
[93:34.82]Mods?
[93:35.94]Mods?
[93:37.95]Mods?
[93:49.91]Mods?
[93:51.71]That's not what they sound like.
[93:58.50]Omega man.
[94:03.25]Omega LOL.
[94:05.87]Where's Gramps?
[94:08.33]What?
[94:08.71]He's talking with the mayor at City Hall?
[94:11.70]I hope he'll be okay.
[94:14.04]By the way, did you see those weird looking ships that just flew past here?
[94:19.04]I've never seen ones like that before.
[94:20.81]I wonder whose they are.
[94:30.19]There, there goes one.
[94:32.15]No, roll, that was just a projection.
[94:42.54]Oh, there goes one.
[94:44.58]Huh?
[94:44.82]What's that noise?
[94:46.06]Sounds like... Oh no, they're attacking the city.
[94:50.43]Gramps is still in there.
[94:54.19]Mega Man, I'm going to go make sure he's alright.
[95:07.94]I haven't eaten all day.
[95:11.06]Are there any carrots in here?
[95:13.77]I'm useless unless I fucking eat.
[95:15.15]Alright, let's go.
[95:23.79]There's birds that are louder than the war going on in the city.
[95:27.30]Roll, hold on!
[95:27.94]Ah, shit!
[95:28.64]I'm sorry, I'm obsessive!
[95:35.15]Holy shit, this song.
[95:40.15]Oh my god.
[95:40.95]I... Okay.
[95:46.30]This is where that song is from.
[95:48.14]I...
[95:51.44]I've tried to remember what this was, and I'm not even talking about recently, I'm talking about like two or three years ago.
[95:59.93]This.
[96:00.19]I was like, what the fuck is that from?
[96:02.07]I hum it all the time.
[96:07.66]You know when something just like snaps into your brain like that, and you realize how much you cared two or three years ago, and now you just don't at all, and you're like, wow, why did I care that much?
[96:17.10]But cool, now that I'm glad I know this.
[96:31.67]Yeah, this is the before the boss.
[96:34.35]Dude, oh my god, this is night- this is my- I've had nightmares with this music in it, and I've tried to figure out what the fuck it was.
[96:44.85]That's what I'm- no, that's what's going on.
[96:48.84]I've had nightmares.
[96:50.70]Like, wicked fucked up dreams with this song would play in the background.
[96:55.38]Slower.
[96:57.40]And, like, the tempo was just decreased.
[97:01.58]Holy shit, this is fucking messed up.
[97:11.45]Like, slower, like... Oh my god, this is insane.
[97:19.47]I forgot... It's kind of like... I'm gonna have to, like, go.
[97:34.74]Hold it right there.
[97:37.44]You can't go in there.
[97:39.96]This area's closed off.
[97:42.90]Please, officer, let us through.
[97:45.93]Our grandfather's in there and... Hmm?
[97:50.87]You can't go in either.
[97:53.19]It's dangerous.
[97:53.69]How about this?
[97:54.43]We arm wrestle, and if I win in less than a tenth of a second, I get to go in.
[97:58.80]Those pirates have attacked the island.
[98:00.70]We'll find out.
[98:01.86]Just like they said they would.
[98:04.68]They're after the treasure that's supposed to be buried here.
[98:09.03]Enough talk.
[98:09.97]You have to leave here.
[98:11.41]Now.
[98:13.67]Pirates?
[98:15.87]They've occupied the gate over there.
[98:18.19]I'll take care of it.
[98:18.91]They're too heavily armed.
[98:21.63]We can't even get close to them.
[98:24.05]I can.
[98:24.83]Maybe I can do something.
[98:27.82]Mega Man, I'm going with you.
[98:31.26]No role is too dangerous.
[98:33.99]He didn't hear that.
[98:34.89]He was gone.
[98:39.35]The two different cops there.
[98:40.92]One cared, one didn't at all.
[98:41.64]But had to make it sound like he did in case somebody was around to witness it.
[99:09.66]Bones.
[99:10.14]I thought it was bone.
[99:10.90]It's not trombone?
[99:12.76]It's tron-bon?
[99:13.41]Why would it be bon?
[99:14.87]Why wouldn't it be trombone?
[99:16.27]That is way more... Tron-bon?
[99:17.49]No, tron-bone!
[99:39.30]Like a trombone.
[99:41.32]Get the key to the gate.
[99:42.16]One of the three Zerbots has the key.
[99:43.68]They can pass it back and forth between them, so you'll have to figure out which one of them has it.
[99:48.52]Each of the three Zerbots robots is unique and has different capabilities.
[99:52.29]Red is built for combat.
[99:53.49]Blue is built for speed.
[99:54.61]And yellow is built for endurance.
[99:57.67]Ooh, that hurt. ...
[100:10.12]dodge.
[100:11.46]Where's the key?
[100:15.72]Alright, let's go for blue.
[100:34.32]Kill blue first.
[100:34.98]Blue's got speed.
[100:47.82]Alright.
[100:48.48]Key?
[100:49.68]Got it.
[100:50.97]Thanks for the key.
[100:53.27]Let me pick a little bit.
[100:54.55]That way.
[100:54.97]First try.
[100:55.47]Easy.
[100:56.75]I want to pick up the money.
[101:02.03]Okay.
[101:09.68]Oh, what happened this time?
[101:11.32]I can't take my eyes off you for a second, can I?
[101:13.90]Just you wait till we get back.
[101:15.24]You're in a lot of trouble.
[101:16.94]Oh, no.
[101:20.06]Who was that?
[101:23.56]Wait, wasn't that the same boy as before?
[101:26.85]He disabled the bloom bears by himself?
[101:31.13]I don't understand.
[101:33.75]Whenever I think about him, I get this funny feeling.
[101:40.33]Oh, forget it!
[101:41.29]Who cares what this feeling is?
[101:43.57]It's all his fault!
[101:45.95]His fault!
[101:47.15]How dare he?
[101:48.71]I'll teach him not to mess with me or my kids!
[101:53.05]Here we go!
[101:54.41]Building up?
[101:55.48]Engage!
[101:56.14]I thought you built him in a factory or something.
[102:01.64]Oh.
[102:09.61]Hey, you!
[102:11.41]Thanks to you, everything's a mess now, isn't it?
[102:15.50]Huh?
[102:16.48]Aren't you the girl who's being chased by that dog?
[102:19.62]Shut up!
[102:20.88]I don't want to hear about that!
[102:24.55]But you have a pretty good last song in the background.
[102:28.31]You should have known better than to pick a fight with the Bonds.
[102:32.09]Of course, if you agree to become one of my servants, I suppose I could forgive you.
[102:37.34]What do you say?
[102:38.14]That way my brother will never have to know about what you did to us.
[102:40.98]Join up with pirates?
[102:42.32]I don't think so.
[102:44.60]Alright then, forget you.
[102:46.42]Fine, see if I care.
[102:47.92]I gave you a chance and you turned it down.
[102:50.32]Don't come back crying to me later.
[103:02.13]Oh, now you done it.
[103:03.45]Now you done it.
[103:04.07]Now I'm fucking mad.
[103:14.46]Ooh.
[103:16.58]Dodge.
[103:19.42]I got no range.
[103:41.91]Go for the legs first.
[103:43.75]No, I got this.
[103:47.51]This is not a... No, I'm not saying it.
[103:49.23]That's not a correct line.
[103:51.01]This is a giant enemy squid.
[103:54.19]Ooh, that hurt.
[104:04.62]Go for the bombs.
[104:23.60]You know, I had to be squibbed.
[104:36.59]I like to run and shoot.
[104:38.51]Very useful.
[104:43.42]The Mario Ga- Whoa!
[104:46.54]That was violent!
[104:51.33]No, it's okay.
[104:51.79]She just got Daffy Ducked.
[104:52.82]She'll be fine.
[104:53.26]Get in quick, right?
[105:16.60]It's not over yet.
[105:17.71]Don't think you've won.
[105:18.99]Next time, I won't be so easy on you.
[105:21.97]I'll make sure you pay for this.
[105:24.65]Let's go.
[105:28.47]See, what would have been really funny would have been door closed and they cut inside and she goes, how are we going to pay for this?
[105:35.09]I could have wrote this.
[105:50.27]Oh, come on.
[105:50.83]That's a perfect, like, kids show for the bad guy to be like, next time we see each other, you'll pay for this.
[105:59.37]Oh, wow, scary.
[106:01.32]Door closed.
[106:02.42]Turn to the minions.
[106:03.68]Oh, we're going to pay for this.
[106:08.06]Really?
[106:08.34]You don't think that your 10-year-old little brother would have laughed or little sister would have laughed at that?
[106:12.17]Of course they would.
[106:16.70]You don't have to think it's funny.
[106:18.53]Your eight-year-old kid did.
[106:22.66]That's not for you.
[106:23.95]That's not for you.
[106:33.03]Indications are that the mysterious group of pirates will continue its offensive for the foreseeable future.
[106:39.61]Recapping our top story of the day, at two o'clock this afternoon, the city center was attacked by a group of unknown pirates who demanded they be given the keys to the caves and tunnels underneath our island.
[106:51.02]Is that one behind you?
[106:51.98]The mayor has refused to give in to their demands and is currently under siege alone in city hall.
[106:57.81]local police are helpless in front of the power of the pirates weapons it may be only a matter of time before city hall is destroyed hopes are rapidly fading as I've just been handed this update viewers it appears that the robots and machines being used to lay siege to the city have been destroyed by a single young boy
[107:23.14]And now, that same boy has come through the gate and is heading towards City Hall.
[107:30.59]Wait!
[107:31.69]There he is!
[107:33.29]I can see him!
[107:34.83]He really is alone!
[107:37.35]Can this lone hero save the mayor?
[107:39.62]Defend City Hall!
[107:43.38]The red robots will attack City Hall, while the yellow robots will attack the nearest building.
[107:47.34]Protect the city, the police station, and the bank.
[107:51.14]Mission start!
[107:53.36]Get this on camera.
[108:04.55]Is this an enemy?
[108:05.11]Give me that money.
[108:10.75]Shit, hold on.
[108:16.31]It appears the boy is a little confused.
[108:19.30]He thinks the local trash compactor
[108:24.57]is one of the robots attacking the city.
[108:36.68]Ladies and gentlemen, the John Deere tractor over there seems to be getting a lot of attention.
[108:41.18]You there!
[108:42.04]Those robots are being deployed by a flying carrier.
[108:50.18]You should go after that first if you want to stop them.
[108:57.38]You there!
[108:58.30]Alright, I gotta... Alright, you!
[109:04.28]Uh-oh.
[109:07.91]Can I aim up that far?
[109:09.93]Holy shit, it's gonna grab me.
[109:15.37]Backseat reporter.
[109:16.89]Backseat reporter.
[109:24.20]I don't understand what's happening, ladies and gentlemen!
[109:26.54]I think he might be blind!
[109:29.22]Can't... What's wrong?
[109:30.44]Streamer blind!
[109:32.81]I'm sorry, Mega Man!
[109:35.27]Mega Man blind!
[109:39.15]I gotta attack the... I don't know, the thing that's flying around.
[110:01.00]Local boy is pretending.
[110:02.60]Alright, where is this thing?
[110:07.03]It's up there.
[110:10.57]How do I get up there?
[110:20.20]Kill, kill that thing!
[110:21.04]The fire seems to be spreading.
[110:23.50]Can our hero save the mayor in time?
[110:29.66]I don't know.
[110:30.18]Let me get control of the game.
[110:53.19]Oh, my God.
[110:53.75]There's somebody...
[111:01.21]Use my mines?
[111:02.19]Oh shit, I have mines.
[111:06.24]Uh, what button do I use?
[111:07.62]How do I activate those?
[111:15.20]Okay, it's... It's triangle.
[111:24.80]Alright, I got that side secure.
[111:29.48]Where's this thing flying around?
[111:30.46]There it is.
[111:33.53]Can I reach it from here?
[111:37.05]Come on.
[111:38.85]I'm out of range.
[111:41.76]No.
[111:42.94]I can't.
[111:43.98]I can't reach it.
[111:50.49]Wait, that's the news!
[111:51.73]Oh shit!
[111:56.22]He's firing at us!
[111:58.04]Everybody get down!
[112:07.47]He's deranged!
[112:23.63]I'm gonna deal with the other buildings.
[112:42.06]Ah!
[112:45.94]Dammit!
[112:47.14]Ah!
[112:52.08]Ah!
[112:58.89]No, kill the flying thing!
[113:00.47]Hit!
[113:00.93]Kill that!
[113:01.35]Alright, there's another one.
[113:15.16]Okay.
[113:20.12]Come here, you.
[113:33.49]Walk over it!
[113:38.72]What about the mayor?
[113:39.90]I got him.
[113:40.20]There's only a couple more.
[113:46.20]This one's an idiot.
[113:46.92]This one's just punching a tree.
[113:47.95]We're fine.
[113:48.27]I'm trying... Oh!
[113:55.75]Alright, I can't hold him.
[113:56.79]I thought I could throw him.
[114:17.26]Come here!
[114:21.51]Alright, we're good.
[114:30.72]How many more?
[114:31.10]Just one more?
[114:34.96]Oh, he got the tree.
[114:37.04]Fuuuuck.
[114:39.20]Fuck.
[114:47.83]No, not the fence.
[114:48.72]Not the plastic fence.
[115:16.09]Uh-oh.
[115:18.35]Frog boss.
[115:19.31]Whoa.
[115:22.89]Oh my god, they're fucking homing.
[115:25.80]They're homing.
[115:26.48]I think I know what I gotta do to you.
[115:27.78]Oh boy.
[115:29.64]Hi.
[115:29.90]Alright.
[115:31.02]Oh my god!
[115:52.46]Spin around.
[115:52.82]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[115:54.59]Alright, we're good.
[115:58.41]A lot of bosses in this game.
[115:59.53]There's like three back-to-back here.
[116:00.78]I guess we kind of walked around and did nothing for like an hour, so getting like three bosses in a row is kind of welcome, right?
[116:19.28]Yeah, right, it is Mega Man.
[116:21.22]Yeah.
[116:24.60]Got it.
[116:33.09]Or not.
[116:39.39]He decapitated that guy.
[116:43.11]No, I didn't.
[116:44.29]That was his whole body and brain.
[116:46.03]He was screwed into a fake body that was animatronic and shit.
[116:49.35]Like, that was his actual body.
[116:50.57]Come on, guys.
[116:51.59]Don't you know anything about video games?
[117:02.22]No, I told them they were in charge, so I won't worry.
[117:08.86]I'll let them take care of it themselves.
[117:16.98]Hey, look at the clock.
[117:19.24]It's almost time for my favorite show.
[117:23.16]I almost missed it.
[117:25.30]Next story.
[117:26.54]City Hall was attacked by a mysterious group of assailants this afternoon, but their offensive was beaten back by an equally mysterious young boy pictured here on screen.
[117:44.37]Favorite show in the news.
[117:46.17]Hmm.
[118:05.99]Alright, it's obvious that I, Teasel Bon, will have to assume command.
[118:10.42]Who needs that key anyway?
[118:11.98]It might take some time and it might take some money, but who cares?
[118:15.84]I'll use my ultimate digging machine, the Morrow Wolf, to dig up the treasure myself.
[118:20.30]And I won't let any little blue boy get in my way either.
[118:28.11]That was a great laugh.
[118:31.27]Wait a sec.
[118:32.09]Bon's probably okay, but what about Tron?
[118:38.12]They're like, it's talking about the same person.
[118:41.26]Tron, okay, but not Bon.
[118:42.62]But Bon is fine.
[118:43.62]But Bon is Tron.
[118:44.56]Tron is Tron.
[118:45.18]Tron and Bon, Bon.
[118:45.94]Why is it not Bon?
[118:51.54]Tron Bon.
[118:51.94]Bon Bon.
[119:08.00]Mega Man, roll!
[119:10.96]Sorry to give you a scare like that.
[119:13.86]Don't you worry, though.
[119:15.80]I'm as healthy as I ever was.
[119:21.86]That's a relief.
[119:23.34]We were worried about you, Gramps.
[119:27.17]With your help, we were able to keep those pirates from getting the key to the ruins.
[119:32.19]Thank you.
[119:34.85]Amelia says she'll give us a diggers licenses.
[119:37.33]Thanks for helping her Now we'll be able to look for parts to fix the flutter.
[119:44.11]I Know it's not much but it's the least I can do for you You got a class a class be like excuse me Your honor we got a new problem those pirates have started digging up the northern forest and
[120:04.29]What?
[120:05.49]They weren't able to get the key.
[120:07.83]So they must be going after the treasure directly.
[120:12.69]I'm amazed they'd go to that much trouble.
[120:15.78]Even if they are criminals, you've got to admire their persistence.
[120:21.58]Who knows what will happen if they get their hands on the treasure.
[120:26.20]Inspector, I want you to arrest them immediately.
[120:29.98]Yes, ma'am.
[120:35.07]Did we do it?
[120:36.63]Did we arrest them?
[120:40.01]We'll have to make sure we get to the ruins before the pirates do.
[120:43.05]I'm sure they won't leave much by the time they're done.
[120:46.15]I gotta go to the ruins.
[120:49.17]With a Class B Digger's license, you can get into the ruins in the Cardun Forest to the south.
[120:57.32]And the ruins up north in the Closer Woods.
[121:00.08]Where the pirates are now.
[121:02.78]Closer Woods.
[121:04.20]Bye Rolf!
[121:07.35]You didn't talk to me I'm going with you Look Mega Man I Fixed the car the junk shop owner gave us I may not have been able to get it fixed in time to help you before
[121:26.92]But next time, you can count on me.
[121:34.61]There goes the inspector and his men off to get the pirates.
[121:39.01]I wonder if he'll be alright.
[121:42.75]Hmm.
[121:44.78]If they're using weapons like they did before, the inspector might have some trouble.
[121:51.18]Not to mention...
[121:53.76]We don't get it?
[121:54.42]I do.
[121:54.62]Oh, they got careful.
[121:55.28]What's wrong with your face?
[122:42.15]I was waiting for it.
[122:44.62]The inspector has left to arrest the pirates.
[122:46.84]I wanted to go too, but it's just as important that someone stays to guard the mayor.
[122:54.34]Why are you parked like this?
[122:59.45]That's not a backpack.
[123:00.33]He's buckled into his gamer chair.
[123:02.99]So is it like a ride at Universal Studios?
[123:07.23]Hey, it's that blue guy again.
[123:11.18]We'll show him, just like we showed that officer.
[123:15.26]We ain't gonna lose this time.
[123:19.64]Oh, yes you are.
[123:20.42]That was pathetic.
[123:39.74]Secret?
[123:41.36]Kick?
[123:41.92]Oh, wow.
[123:43.00]I could... I could just float.
[123:45.44]I don't think... Okay.
[123:51.14]Yeah, I think he was sleeping in that one.
[123:58.83]Whatever.
[124:03.23]He... I...
[124:13.15]There's a guy behind me too.
[124:15.77]No, it's up on the ledge.
[124:27.71]I might get up there.
[124:28.43]Give me that.
[124:29.43]Come on, give it to me.
[124:35.09]Fire.
[124:38.32]Good.
[124:43.41]Oh, fuck it.
[124:43.89]I can't get up there.
[124:48.71]You good?
[124:53.05]How am I today?
[124:53.57]I'm doing pretty well.
[124:55.94]What is in here?
[124:58.34]Nothing like this has ever happened in the history of this island.
[125:02.48]The police don't have any kind of weapons that can stand up to those pirates.
[125:08.85]Oh, it's you.
[125:09.95]Those pirates' weapons are too strong.
[125:12.67]We can't get close.
[125:14.75]It'll only be a matter of time before they find the treasure.
[125:19.26]We got to do something, but what can we do?
[125:25.16]I thought I would be safe here, but there's nowhere to run.
[125:27.83]They're everywhere.
[125:28.61]Maybe this is the legendary disaster that's supposed to happen to the island.
[125:33.05]What?
[125:36.28]Can I not get up there?
[125:37.00]Oh, let's go over here
[126:03.21]I need to upgrade my weapon.
[126:04.13]This thing sucks.
[126:12.82]I got to only attack on it.
[126:14.16]I need more attack.
[126:15.72]Is this where I came from?
[126:21.62]I have no range.
[126:30.68]Come on, let's grind some money.
[126:34.00]13.8 streamer.
[126:35.43]Omega low.
[126:36.05]That's really good, actually.
[126:36.91]That's like in the top 0.02% of people that have ever gone to that website.
[126:41.27]That's alright.
[127:00.69]I can't shoot these guys?
[127:05.95]I can't... I can't kick you out.
[127:10.61]You can only kick when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no... when there's no...
[127:42.18]I'm realizing how bad this house is.
[127:46.30]It's just a door that leads in... Where's the bathroom?
[127:50.28]Is there even any kitchen in here?
[127:51.70]It's just a block.
[127:53.68]This is a shed.
[127:56.02]Yeah.
[127:58.58]Oh, I think I can reach this now.
[128:00.38]Yep.
[128:09.95]Some chests up here.
[128:17.67]Not really, but I can go down here?
[128:26.90]There's another trash.
[128:33.64]Let me go this way.
[128:36.44]I got two at the same time.
[128:38.17]Yeah, I'm gonna get ranged.
[128:39.85]I hope you said get ranged.
[128:41.31]You're very, very smart.
[128:46.59]Oh!
[128:47.29]I'm gonna die.
[128:59.35]What's that canteen button?
[129:13.06]I actually gotta open the inventory?
[129:14.26]Okay.
[129:18.55]Uh, normal items.
[129:20.19]Broken cleaner.
[129:25.41]Special items.
[129:27.55]Energy canteen.
[129:29.83]Fracture found in the tower.
[129:30.81]Okay, energy canteen.
[129:31.70]Use one.
[129:34.08]Whoa, I used all six?
[129:36.12]Slow down, man!
[129:39.54]You drank all six servings!
[129:42.84]Just drink one serving!
[130:01.35]He's thirsty.
[130:01.92]You don't drink them all.
[130:04.92]You gotta space it out.
[130:06.56]Can't jump that.
[130:17.45]This is a good, uh, money grind, though.
[130:20.51]Cash.
[130:20.87]Alright, I can go over here.
[130:24.33]What's over here?
[130:25.60]Oh, monkey.
[130:28.52]Refill everything.
[130:31.72]Somebody just said, fuck Reddit.
[130:35.84]Okay.
[130:37.38]I don't know why you need me to say that.
[130:40.57]I don't own that website.
[130:45.21]I have nothing to do with that website.
[130:47.61]Be careful.
[130:48.77]Recharge energy.
[130:50.27]Save game.
[130:57.13]Allegedly?
[130:57.99]Allegedly.
[131:08.27]I don't want to go in there yet.
[131:09.15]I want to explore a little bit more.
[131:10.03]Let's see if there's anything else over here.
[131:23.87]Buy high, sell low.
[131:25.45]Good advice.
[131:25.73]This is hot.
[131:38.42]Where's this going?
[131:45.40]Oh, it's a little... Hold on.
[131:48.50]Let me just check it out.
[131:49.74]I just have to check it out.
[131:54.22]There's a chest right here.
[131:59.80]1780 zeny.
[132:00.78]Yep.
[132:03.30]This one's actually a good edit.
[132:06.46]No, how?
[132:07.24]It's the same picture that somebody's been... We gotta talk about the images.
[132:24.18]Oh, we gotta talk about the images.
[132:26.29]It's trapped!
[132:28.29]Alright, but is there anything... Is there something in it?
[132:37.47]Oh yeah, there is!
[132:38.23]There's a shitload of money in here!
[132:39.33]That was worth it.
[132:46.76]There's a hole.
[132:47.28]1510 zeny.
[132:52.50]I got a lot of money.
[132:53.40]Oh, that's a patched up hole.
[132:57.16]Is this just like a little random dungeon?
[132:59.93]This is actually pretty sick.
[133:04.72]Oh, I think I know what this is.
[133:11.58]Probably have to come back here later.
[133:12.96]But, I mean, I'm here.
[133:14.16]Might as well look.
[133:14.96]There's a chest up there.
[133:22.53]I can't get too off.
[133:25.59]Alright.
[133:38.94]Can we get up there?
[133:39.78]Go to the ladder.
[133:40.86]Oh yeah, ladder, you're right.
[133:41.90]Go to the ladder.
[133:43.38]Yeah, that's cool.
[133:45.16]Jerma, what the fuck are you doing?
[133:46.34]There's a ladder.
[133:46.89]Yeah, I know, fucking cool dude.
[133:51.83]Wait, let me look.
[134:01.00]No, nothing.
[134:06.48]This streamer is a cheater.
[134:08.04]Just checking to see if there's anything else in there.
[134:17.82]Wanted to explore the whole thing.
[134:18.80]Found the ladder that you were talking about.
[134:28.92]There's a big chest over there.
[134:30.14]There's lots of chests up here.
[134:32.32]Alright, be careful.
[134:42.71]Damn it.
[134:43.57]Alright, get over here.
[134:44.17]Come on.
[134:46.65]Good tactic.
[134:51.23]Good tactic.
[134:51.61]Alright, can I reach this by jumping?
[134:54.63]I guess I can.
[134:55.46]Wait, don't be so hasty.
[135:02.76]Okay.
[135:03.70]What's in the chest?
[135:04.30]Cannon kit.
[135:08.25]Ooh.
[135:10.13]Yep.
[135:10.53]There's another one on the other side, right?
[135:12.09]I thought I saw another chest.
[135:18.83]I got a lot of money, too.
[135:31.78]No other chest?
[135:32.48]Really?
[135:37.34]No other chest?
[135:39.02]Oh!
[135:39.82]It's okay.
[135:40.08]Oh, no.
[135:49.34]No!
[135:49.92]Look, it's right there.
[135:50.90]It's so close.
[135:51.86]I just want what's in it.
[135:54.64]Give it to me.
[135:56.15]I deserve it.
[136:06.87]Alright, well, I got a cannon kit.
[136:08.63]What the fuck was that?
[136:16.92]We're gonna have to backtrack to get these?
[136:19.20]Yeah.
[136:20.88]Whenever I get this, whatever upgrade it is to be able to jump higher, we're gonna use it.
[136:26.36]Although, I'm gonna forget where all these are.
[136:35.42]You can rocket jump with a mine?
[136:36.78]That doesn't... No, it doesn't.
[136:38.79]I'll... Why did I even listen to you for even a... Why would I even think to do that?
[136:46.25]Alright, let's go save it again.
[136:54.63]Did I do everything in here?
[136:56.01]Yeah.
[137:02.63]Do I remember how to rocket jump?
[137:05.20]Yeah.
[137:06.58]If you put me in front of a computer right now with a rocket jump mechanic, like a soldier in TF2, I'd be able to do one decent crouch jump rocket jump.
[137:15.16]That's it.
[137:19.46]Just checking this perimeter.
[137:25.06]Okay, so now we're going to go into where that monkey is and do the mission.
[137:39.94]How much money do I have now?
[137:41.04]Why don't I want to pick this flower up?
[137:44.46]I feel like I want to.
[137:46.30]Okay.
[137:46.92]I want a flower.
[137:55.43]Alright.
[138:01.09]Remember, you're the Jeff Bezos of Mega Man.
[138:08.17]What is that logic?
[138:10.77]You can hit them.
[138:13.69]But I just can't lock on.
[138:16.45]I'm smoldering.
[138:21.95]Pirates are digging in here!
[138:22.85]Get in there, quick!
[138:26.64]You fucking killed him.
[138:27.66]You killed him, you killed him!
[138:31.04]Yeah, sorry guys.
[138:32.60]I may have killed the guy that was driving the tank, trying to shoot and kill me, and other people in the town.
[138:39.04]Sorry.
[138:42.90]The guy was shooting missiles at me and at other people that live here.
[138:47.82]Here's a...
[139:09.50]Got him!
[139:12.24]Good.
[139:13.18]That hit me.
[139:24.93]Ow.
[139:25.07]Alright, he just got hit by his own thing.
[139:31.65]I had nothing to do with that.
[139:40.66]Murder, murder, murder, murder, murder.
[139:47.72]What gives?
[139:50.86]I dig and I dig and I'm still nowhere near the bottom.
[139:59.30]Maybe we will need that key after all.
[140:01.52]Master Teasel, we were beaten.
[140:06.16]That blue boy is heading this way.
[140:08.30]He's coming.
[140:10.35]Time to lose.
[140:10.81]Roger!
[140:29.84]Oh, he was doing two snubs at once.
[140:32.19]That was ridiculous.
[140:33.87]Showdown with T-Bone.
[140:36.37]He must destroy the digging robot Marlwolf.
[140:39.19]The robot's outer shell is heavily armored, but the hatch is nearly defenseless.
[140:42.45]Shoot the treads to slow the robot down, then jump on the robot from the rocks and shoot at the hatch.
[140:49.81]Thanks for everything.
[140:52.03]Thanks for the wiki article to describe it a beat-em.
[140:59.71]Alright, two treads.
[141:08.85]No, I won't.
[141:12.05]Blow it down, then get on the rocks.
[141:24.06]Whoa!
[141:28.22]oh come on mega man hey are you paying attention you're not gonna get through these robots
[141:56.36]Oh, this is painful.
[141:58.20]There's no iframes.
[141:59.06]This fucking game doesn't work for me.
[142:03.66]Stop!
[142:04.94]Open this fucking hatch!
[142:08.18]Here we go!
[142:08.56]Alright.
[142:10.55]How do I... Dude, there's shit everywhere!
[142:35.90]Give me health.
[142:39.82]Give me your life force.
[142:42.56]Alright, now shoot the... I gotta go... Oh, I gotta climb up.
[142:45.89]Hold on.
[142:48.89]Why is it empty?
[142:49.55]Didn't I refill it?
[142:50.89]How does it get up on the... Like the grass?
[142:57.67]The ledge or something?
[142:59.97]Wait.
[143:03.46]I have to refill it at the shop.
[143:05.18]Oh, fuck.
[143:05.82]I'm gonna die.
[143:12.30]Wait, let me find a good spot to get up here first.
[143:14.06]Alright, it's this one in the back.
[143:24.31]And then that puts me... Oh, she's a gutter.
[143:33.55]Shit.
[143:35.57]Oh, I almost jumped into it.
[143:36.55]Alright, now can I get on... Is he not destr... Can I jump on that?
[143:46.82]I hit the hatch.
[143:54.82]Fuck, I tried to jump but it didn't work.
[144:00.41]Alright, so I gotta get back up there.
[144:01.49]I tried to jump but it didn't work.
[144:08.94]What?
[144:13.12]I can't... I can't grab onto the top of this thing?
[144:32.85]These things are still chasing me, too.
[144:37.31]Okay.
[144:39.02]I'm still alive.
[144:42.08]Alright, I made it.
[144:45.04]Go in?
[144:45.34]Can I go in the...
[145:07.08]Alright.
[145:10.84]Oh shit, my save file is fucking corrupted.
[145:16.07]Revenge?
[145:24.29]So shoot his wheels, he breaks down, and then you climb up, jump on his back, and then shoot him from... on his hatch?
[145:37.49]Come on, I want to like restart because of that.
[145:55.44]Snart!
[145:56.00]You must destroy the robot, yep.
[145:58.87]Hatch is nearly defenseless.
[146:01.07]Take the treads to slow the robot down, then jump on the robot from the rocks and shoot at the hatch.
[146:06.01]Yeah, that's what I was going to do, but I got fucking... The guy came up with a bomb.
[146:09.51]As soon as it hits...
[146:32.60]Dude!
[146:33.04]Alright, is he done?
[146:42.27]Alright, he's done.
[146:48.09]Go all the way back, not this way, up here.
[147:04.20]Really?
[147:08.97]Nope.
[147:12.77]Other one.
[147:13.33]There's the other one.
[147:22.69]Okay.
[147:23.89]Get on the hatch, and then shoot when the hatch opens.
[147:32.28]Jesus!
[147:32.74]Okay, give me that health.
[147:37.26]I want it.
[147:46.99]Oh!
[147:52.23]Okay.
[147:55.57]What the fuck?! !
[147:59.58]God damn it!
[148:02.57]Shoot the hatch!
[148:04.09]Did I get it?
[148:10.67]Don't even jump on the robot, just shoot it when it opens like this.
[148:12.83]Oh my god!
[148:19.04]Stop!
[148:21.82]Fucking camera!
[148:25.67]Shoot in the hatch!
[148:32.00]OH.
[148:32.52]MY.
[148:33.36]GOD.
[148:40.06]IT'S FUCKING- BWAH!
[148:41.60]Come on, I want you to shoot the- Just- don't dodge roll.
[148:55.34]Alright, SHOOT IT!
[148:58.26]You motherfucker.
[149:03.71]Open!
[149:06.65]Oh, I fell off the goddamn stupid... I have to mash and press as hard as I can on R1 and L1 to turn this fucking camera.
[149:27.73]Can't hit him in the mind.
[149:36.29]Oh my god, it's a bomb!
[149:58.51]Other way.
[149:59.07]Why did I not get hit?
[150:14.72]I need that range.
[150:30.13]Why did I get the range upgrade?
[150:32.81]I've got double power.
[150:33.85]I should have range.
[150:36.25]Oh my fuck!
[150:38.15]Don't die here, please.
[150:40.09]Go around.
[151:01.47]Get these bomb bats.
[151:04.01]Get the bomb bat.
[151:04.99]Get that bomb bat!
[151:11.57]What the fuck?
[151:13.51]No!
[151:20.05]Scraps alleged.
[151:24.28]Dude!
[151:25.06]This fucking doesn't... You punk!
[151:45.04]Oh my fucking god, it just- why does someone fall the fuck out of you?
[152:08.53]He can't do it behind.
[152:17.67]I can hit once, I'm dead
[152:43.24]You should have seen me in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 with this little motherfucker.
[152:45.96]I was pretty damn good.
[153:20.24]Oh, okay.
[153:20.52]I get one side to do that all over again.
[153:50.97]no more tanks right okay um how do I get the hell out of here
[154:20.28]Megaman, can you hear me?
[154:23.24]The mayor says there's something real important she has to talk with you about.
[154:26.76]Why, is she in the tree?
[154:28.28]Can you come back here?
[154:29.34]Is she in the suit?
[154:36.90]Roger.
[154:38.02]I'll head back to City Hall.
[154:46.66]That didn't sound like a radio.
[154:47.79]That sounded like she was talking to a pillow.
[154:50.29]Or like through a wall.
[154:53.25]If only we'd known there was someone like him here in the first place.
[154:57.95]We won't fail next time.
[154:59.33]We'll ambush him.
[155:00.35]Concentrate our firepower on him.
[155:03.28]We won't cut him any slack just because we outnumber him.
[155:06.72]That kid's going down.
[155:08.64]Just wait till you see, Diesel.
[155:11.36]I've got a new robot I've been wanting to build that'll do the trick.
[155:15.22]That'll teach him.
[155:17.05]This time, we get rid of Blue Boy for sure!
[155:21.05]And get that treasure!
[155:30.81]They make a cartoon about this.
[155:33.85]Mega Man, good going!
[155:35.71]You showed those pirates who's boss!
[155:38.84]Yeah, it looks like a screen name.
[155:40.44]It doesn't look like I'm Mega Man.
[155:41.64]It looks like my screen name is Mega Man.
[155:43.66]You've done so much for us.
[155:46.70]I hope this will convince those pirates to give up.
[155:50.10]I'm afraid to think what might happen if they get their hands on the treasure.
[155:54.54]The legends say a horrible disaster will occur if it's ever unearthed.
[156:02.41]Even if that's just a myth, lately we've been detecting increased activity underground.
[156:08.65]The Reaverbots are apparently activating of their own accord.
[156:12.83]We gotta talk about the images.
[156:15.49]We gotta talk about the images.
[156:16.45]Why does it say no to this?
[156:46.74]It's pretty good.
[156:49.74]Oh, no, this is back when video games had a no response to everything.
[156:57.54]And it always was, no, you won't?
[157:01.72]How could you say something like that?
[157:03.50]Will you?
[157:04.44]And then you just say yes, right?
[157:06.08]Like, they used to do this.
[157:06.74]I don't know why.
[157:07.70]What was the point of that?
[157:09.66]Old games did this all the time.
[157:12.11]It was always they give you a yes or no question and you would answer no and it would be like a one sentence joke and they would go back to yes.
[157:23.02]Only the best diggers are able to get a Class A license.
[157:27.02]The best of the best.
[157:29.86]With that license, you'll be able to get into the sealed off sites.
[157:34.17]Sealed off sites?
[157:35.09]The ones those pirates have been trying to break into.
[157:38.97]I give you my permission to dig in the island's sub-gates.
[157:42.77]Just let me know if you find anything that can tell us about the treasure, or that disaster that's supposed to happen if the treasure's disturbed.
[157:51.44]And... I hate to mention this, but... If while you're digging, you find anything of value, it would mean a lot to us if you could donate it to help with the restoration of the city.
[158:05.03]Thank you again.
[158:07.23]Be careful.
[158:10.76]Can somebody give me a health potion?
[158:12.93]I'm... I'm a stubbed toe away from dying.
[158:21.68]We'll go to the crash site.
[158:22.92]Where we actually crashed.
[158:25.18]Oh, I want a bank account too.
[159:05.36]Uh, let's save.
[159:09.90]Save.
[159:13.20]I smell a car joke.
[159:14.80]Um... I mean, that would have been bad.
[159:18.58]It would have been funny for a sec.
[159:19.72]But then I would have had to do the entire boss over again.
[159:21.78]And I'm... I'm not... I don't want to... No.
[159:25.81]That's too far back.
[159:26.47]We got all the dialog to go through.
[159:27.67]All the cutscenes.
[159:28.27]No.
[159:29.39]No, no, no.
[159:31.11]Not gonna happen.
[159:34.03]Alright, Dr. Roll, I have some equipment.
[159:38.03]Let me tell you about what I can do for you.
[159:39.37]Yeah, first of all, you can change your special weapons here.
[159:42.63]You can only use one special weapon at a time.
[159:46.12]Let me know when you want to switch.
[159:48.40]Also, it costs a little money, but we can enhance your special weapons here.
[159:53.04]As item development, I might be able to make something new out of things you find in the ruins.
[159:58.98]Find something interesting, be sure to bring it back here.
[160:02.68]Last, we can use the support car to move around the island.
[160:05.64]Nice fast travel.
[160:06.96]Capcom thought of everything.
[160:08.76]Here, I made a walkie-talkie for you.
[160:10.14]You can use to call me anytime.
[160:12.31]Use it when you want me to pick you up in the support car.
[160:17.33]I can now give the walkie-talkie back and make it into a weapon.
[160:21.15]There's a few places I can't get the car.
[160:24.37]Won't be able to pick you up even if you call me.
[160:26.59]Sorry.
[160:27.95]Okay.
[160:29.74]Item development.
[160:31.72]Okay, I'll take a look.
[160:36.30]Ta-da!
[160:37.74]The cannon kit was used to make... Powered Buster Special Weapon.
[160:43.93]This weapon has a really long range and a pretty good punch, but its rate of fire isn't that great.
[160:49.35]Don't forget that when you get into a fight... Don't forget what?
[160:53.85]Oh, don't forget that.
[160:54.57]Alright, any more item development?
[161:04.51]What about, um... Okay, special weapons.
[161:07.54]Change weapon.
[161:10.30]Splash mine.
[161:16.32]Powered buster.
[161:18.84]Let's try it.
[161:20.44]Here you go.
[161:22.42]Enhance weapon.
[161:25.87]First, choose a weapon.
[161:27.43]Powered Buster.
[161:28.81]What do you want to enhance?
[161:29.95]Oh, man.
[161:33.01]Alright.
[161:33.39]How about... I can't enhance any... How much money?
[161:34.87]21,000?
[161:34.89]3,500 is any.
[161:35.23]Do it again.
[161:35.53]11,000?
[161:36.01]That's a lot of money.
[161:36.95]Ammo...
[161:56.90]Make it even more range.
[162:02.04]Okay.
[162:03.66]Even more.
[162:07.51]Ugh.
[162:11.95]Alright, alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[162:14.39]I'm gonna use all my- I don't wanna use all my money.
[162:19.05]Cool.
[162:22.50]Alright, let's go, uh, take a support car.
[162:25.16]Downtown.
[162:32.64]We're here.
[162:33.10]How's the game?
[162:38.48]The game's awesome.
[162:40.79]I love this game.
[162:44.07]It's got quite a kick.
[162:48.81]Uh, where's the junk store?
[162:51.77]South, right?
[163:06.28]He loves it.
[163:07.04]Keepo happy.
[163:08.83]It's just, it's real, it's just fun.
[163:16.41]Go to the bank?
[163:17.09]I will.
[163:17.63]Eventually.
[163:20.13]Let's upgrade my body.
[163:24.88]Okay, buy item.
[163:27.38]Another life gauge.
[163:33.10]Uh, black jacket reduces damage by one-fourth.
[163:39.70]Repairs damage life shield.
[163:41.56]Yeah, this too.
[163:44.28]Um.
[163:46.58]Okay, hold on.
[163:48.22]Parts.
[163:49.32]Last unit.
[163:50.06]Okay, hold on.
[163:54.90]Super unit.
[163:59.47]What is... Energy?
[164:01.71]Range 2, Energy 1.
[164:02.73]Attack 1, Energy 2.
[164:07.07]Range 2, Energy 2.
[164:12.83]Super... Sniper Unit, right.
[164:16.03]I want to get this one.
[164:20.13]Give me that one.
[164:24.91]Give me the Sniper Unit too.
[164:26.76]I'll put these both on.
[164:31.72]And I can afford another pack.
[164:37.51]I do another pack.
[164:38.59]And they have another one.
[164:41.59]Alright.
[164:44.35]Refill the canteen.
[164:46.81]Good.
[164:49.89]Buster parts.
[164:51.75]So we have plus one attack.
[164:53.68]We'll do... Last unit.
[164:57.62]Keeps the one attack but adds energy.
[165:00.63]And then I can get the power razor.
[165:04.21]Place this with the more... I need the range so bad.
[165:08.50]I don't lose any attack or anything, so.
[165:11.62]Oh yes I do.
[165:12.12]Fuck.
[165:15.72]Energy and range.
[165:19.97]I'm losing a lot of attack though.
[165:26.51]I'll keep it for now.
[165:30.11]Special items, yeah.
[165:31.48]Good.
[165:33.04]Buster parts.
[165:43.90]Energy means more shots at a time.
[165:45.70]So that's more DPS.
[165:49.36]That's more DPS.
[165:50.44]I'll take it.
[165:57.97]Kick can't.
[165:58.63]Nah.
[166:01.58]Alright, come get me.
[166:05.05]Special weapons?
[166:07.31]Special weapons status.
[166:08.43]Arm.
[166:08.71]Normal arm.
[166:09.35]Infinity.
[166:10.07]Oh.
[166:11.17]Okay, um... Come get me.
[166:17.94]I know you're right down the street, but come get me.
[166:21.18]Now let's go to... Where did my mind go?
[166:23.98]Let's go to Cardin Forest.
[166:32.62]Save the game.
[166:34.98]Charge everything up.
[166:36.38]Keep going.
[166:48.12]So I have to go back to the crash site.
[166:56.21]Let's check this out.
[166:56.73]Let's see how it looks.
[166:57.39]Whoa.
[167:03.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[167:05.15]That's 7 shots.
[167:08.29]And it's much higher range, too.
[167:12.29]And a big gun.
[167:15.78]Cool.
[167:16.74]Cool.
[167:17.00]Alright, recharge.
[167:21.14]Alright, me out.
[167:30.63]You killed that guy.
[167:31.53]I did not.
[167:31.95]He's fine.
[167:33.73]Alright, we're looking for a dig site.
[167:35.05]I thought I'd come out here to look at the sub-gate.
[167:38.91]But I can't get anywhere near it.
[167:40.72]With those pirates running around.
[167:42.10]These are some wild ass birds.
[167:46.48]Somebody said it when we first started playing.
[167:49.86]Seriously, it's fucking wild.
[167:55.19]Looking for a sub-gate?
[168:06.87]What does a sub-gate look like?
[168:07.94]It's not that, right?
[168:10.24]I mean, it looks like it could be a sub-gate.
[168:16.42]But haven't we gone in here before?
[168:19.68]I was looking for mushrooms on the other side of the passage when a tank rolled up out of nowhere.
[168:24.11]I'm getting out of here.
[168:29.41]That was quick.
[168:31.83]Holy shit, that was fast.
[168:38.02]We've got to buy Ms.
[168:39.14]Tron the time she needs to finish the robot.
[168:43.26]Okay, everybody, on your toes.
[168:46.80]Let's show Ms.
[168:47.58]Tron what we can do.
[168:51.58]What do you want to do?
[168:53.46]Continue on.
[168:54.00]I want to keep going.
[168:55.04]I want to play the game.
[168:57.00]I've come to back you up, Mega Man.
[168:58.62]No, no, no.
[168:59.30]Get out of here, Roll.
[168:59.87]Get out.
[169:00.05]I may not be able to do much.
[169:02.23]Get out of here!
[169:03.07]The magic school bus is not gonna help us against a tank.
[169:06.71]What?
[169:30.17]I love having the extra shots.
[169:32.19]If you get in trouble, use the car as a shield.
[169:36.74]Roll?
[169:38.64]Use the car as a shield?
[169:40.04]As a payload?
[169:41.26]Alright, we're almost up to this first checkpoint.
[170:08.98]I'll get too much damage.
[170:15.94]I want rapid fire.
[170:16.85]I feel like that would be more useful to me.
[170:22.91]The cart has almost reached the final terminus!
[170:45.05]Get this thing moving!
[170:55.19]Got it.
[170:58.28]Get the points, stupid!
[171:04.00]What a great game.
[171:04.70]Some would argue one of the best.
[171:11.06]Team Fortress 2 is The Simpsons of arena shooters at this point.
[171:18.32]Everyone took from them.
[171:19.24]They did it first.
[171:20.52]Everything.
[171:26.65]Halo, they did it.
[171:34.01]Class-based shooter, they did it.
[171:36.54]Opening boxes, they did it.
[171:45.49]Oh, we did it!
[171:46.68]Victory.
[172:12.19]New area.
[172:13.79]This is a new zone.
[172:15.28]Oh, this is an ice zone.
[172:17.52]Watch out for that item over there.
[172:19.38]Fuck, chat.
[172:22.04]Chat, what do I do here?
[172:24.90]Fucking chat, you know what I mean?
[172:27.28]Can you hear me, Mega Man?
[172:28.68]Can you hear me?
[172:29.19]Yeah.
[172:29.61]I'm picking up high energy readings from close by.
[172:33.87]It looks like it's a refractor.
[172:36.53]And a big one, too.
[172:41.78]I'm not going to be able to take this.
[172:44.52]Is the refractor shielded?
[172:47.16]Most high-level refractors are protected in some kind of shield.
[172:51.60]You'll have to look for the control console and deactivate the shield.
[172:55.33]Thank you for the info.
[172:57.59]Hamster in my front pocket.
[173:02.13]Nothing?
[173:02.63]It looks like the starter's missing.
[173:06.29]It's probably hidden somewhere nearby.
[173:08.55]You'll have to find it.
[173:11.35]Remember, there might be more than one starter key, too.
[173:14.93]Ooh, more than one key.
[173:17.52]Alright, we gotta activate the refractor.
[173:25.52]We got super-powered, super-charged-up fighting abilities.
[173:30.02]Man, look at this range.
[173:32.54]The AI doesn't even start, and I win.
[173:35.89]Oh my god, that's a lot of money!
[173:52.40]That was a lot of cash.
[173:55.14]Those are just treasure boxes, holy shit.
[173:56.60]Right, where's this last one?
[173:58.19]Where are you?
[174:00.05]There's one more flying around, right?
[174:01.69]I'm in, look at him, being seen.
[174:03.17]Where is it?
[174:17.47]No!
[174:20.28]No!
[174:21.70]No!
[174:22.06]I thought I could jump to it.
[174:22.82]No!
[174:23.86]Oh!
[174:24.16]There's a bridge here.
[174:30.93]Okay, damn it.
[174:34.88]That's a lot of money.
[174:36.48]It's okay.
[174:42.56]You can leave and come back.
[174:43.54]Yeah, but I don't.
[174:44.38]Still, I'm still upset about it.
[174:45.99]I'm not allowed to be upset about something that horrible that just happened to me.
[174:59.66]Let me get back up here.
[175:00.34]I'm going to get itchy eyes.
[175:18.11]God damn it.
[175:21.16]No, don't... Okay, you have to die now.
[175:27.62]No, I'm stuck here.
[175:32.67]How much health do you have?
[175:42.27]Alright, I have my powers.
[175:43.78]I have really low power.
[175:45.72]I have low attack.
[175:48.13]Right, right, right.
[175:49.15]I got it.
[175:51.57]Can I get up there from here?
[175:52.75]I gotta pee.
[176:00.94]Yeah, I gotta pee.
[176:12.67]There we go.
[176:17.42]Yeah, the next opportunity I take... Yeah, let's go.
[176:20.47]I'm gonna take a peek.
[176:22.65]I'll be right back.
[176:23.13]See you guys in a minute.
[176:24.67]I'm gonna grab a water, too.
[176:26.20]Might as well.
[181:23.29]I've been back for maybe a minute, two minutes.
[181:29.04]Just been spying on you.
[181:32.34]Just kind of seeing what you guys are writing.
[181:34.80]When you know I'm not here.
[181:36.82]Interesting stuff.
[181:40.47]My favorite one was Jerma sits in the bathtub to go to the bathroom.
[181:45.63]Like with water or I don't know what you mean by that.
[181:48.95]I'm always watching.
[181:50.17]I always have eyes.
[182:03.33]Ah, that's how you do it.
[182:20.69]What is this?
[182:22.59]Yeah, I did.
[182:23.19]Oh, it's the key!
[182:24.09]I thought this was an urn.
[182:26.26]I had to get down.
[182:44.27]Also, don't mind my chewing sounds.
[182:46.85]Sorry.
[182:47.05]I'm going to try to keep it as discreet as possible.
[182:50.11]I've got an absolutely delicious bag of craved chili lime beef jerky.
[183:02.21]Some would say the best.
[183:17.09]Was it ramp?
[183:24.10]Was that ramp?
[183:38.68]Don't choke on it this time?
[183:39.86]Well, I didn't choke on it last time.
[183:41.90]I aspirated it into my lungs.
[183:45.37]Oh.
[183:45.79]It was a slight difference.
[183:48.52]Oh, fuck.
[183:55.58]Are there any more bridges?
[184:01.55]No, I want to get up there though.
[184:02.49]Alright, whatever.
[184:03.01]Let's go.
[184:05.77]What does the cannon do?
[184:06.63]It does a big explosion.
[184:29.74]What's this?
[184:30.08]What's that do?
[184:32.30]What's this?
[184:32.82]Uh, there's buttons?
[184:35.40]Hold on.
[184:35.74]Let me check out over here first.
[184:39.99]Yeah, roll.
[184:40.25]I remember.
[184:40.62]I didn't have any food either.
[184:41.90]That was great.
[184:43.02]It was fun.
[184:43.40]That's something we laugh about now.
[184:45.10]The fact that I was starving to death for three days.
[184:47.76]Well, I'm glad you can enjoy it.
[184:50.20]Oh, shit.
[184:50.46]This is ice.
[185:10.28]Open it, quick!
[185:18.01]What?
[185:29.97]Wait!
[185:32.81]My goodies!
[185:34.76]What's gonna happen?
[185:39.74]will it open it?
[185:46.02]is it gonna open it?
[185:49.42]uh what's it gonna go through the smasher?
[185:57.43]oh nice alright there's a crusher over here alright I'm gonna be ready there's something there it looks like some kind of compactor or something
[186:10.51]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[186:14.97]I just gotta ground up for a second.
[186:17.85]I need one more.
[186:20.22]Reverse it?
[186:24.88]Oh, so it goes the other way.
[186:27.50]How long is the game?
[186:28.22]Um, I don't know.
[186:30.35]It says, like, seven-ish hours, so, I don't know.
[186:34.23]Hold on a sec.
[186:48.03]There's another one in here?
[187:09.69]Sounds I can make without making noise with my mouth.
[187:24.33]It's longer than a typical Mega... Typical Mega Man... Typical... Why can't I say this?
[187:28.28]Typical Mega Man game.
[187:32.42]Um... Anything in... Hmm.
[187:41.60]Can I go... I want to go back like this.
[187:44.49]I'm missing holes in walls.
[187:45.49]You're right.
[187:45.87]Fuck.
[187:47.47]You're right.
[187:47.75]You're right.
[187:48.01]No, you're right.
[187:48.37]You're right.
[187:48.69]Right.
[187:48.83]I'm missing a lot of holes.
[187:51.13]Oh, I felt the... Yep.
[187:53.94]Grenade kit.
[187:54.70]I didn't even look.
[188:00.66]Alright, what about over here across the way?
[188:02.78]Just don't fall through the ice.
[188:11.19]Just walk over it normally, you're fine.
[188:18.33]Big bit.
[188:18.87]Big bits.
[188:23.39]Let's check on the big bits.
[188:26.71]We had $5,050 from Bitslave again.
[188:33.09]Bitslave just gave $100 today.
[188:34.77]10,000 fucking bits.
[188:36.27]Reviewing the Johnny Walker Best Spring Set.
[188:39.17]What is that?
[188:41.71]They say now... Hey, Jerma, since I started watching your streams, you've helped me get through some of the worst times of my life.
[188:46.74]Doesn't look like there are any big Rebobots here.
[188:48.34]And to this day, I can say that watching your VODs really helps me.
[188:51.10]You better stay on your toes.
[188:55.15]Also, being in the Air Force means I meet some of the best people this country has to offer.
[189:00.24]At the same time, it means I must bid farewell to them and never see them again.
[189:03.62]I've met some of the greatest friends I had.
[189:05.26]I met some of my greatest friends and had to say heartbreaking goodbyes to them within a single year.
[189:11.16]You are therapy to me.
[189:17.13]Thank you so much for this message.
[189:23.00]I actually know somebody who's in the Coast Guard.
[189:27.34]And they have... They're always moving around.
[189:34.65]Every, like, three or four years, they move.
[189:37.35]And they kind of have to say goodbye to everybody that's in their life and change, essentially, their whole life again and meet new people and stuff every couple of years.
[189:47.19]So, I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to here, but it's... I can never imagine doing it.
[189:58.62]So, thank you for doing it.
[190:01.12]Because I can't imagine doing it.
[190:11.22]And if you can come and watch this stream and it's something that's... familiar or fun or whatever, that's... that makes me happy.
[190:19.72]I'm... I'm glad that this stream is something that you can get out of it.
[190:24.41]Thanks a lot for your huge support.
[190:28.81]And thank you for serving the country, too.
[190:36.15]You can't escape us, Turbo.
[190:37.70]What?
[190:40.86]I can't... Why do you think I'm trying to escape?
[190:47.32]Play the game, jerk breather.
[190:51.21]I'm eating jerky right now.
[190:53.03]Come on, I'm trying to get new strategies.
[190:55.23]People made fun of my baby food, so I'm trying to eat like a real steak.
[191:02.51]Dude, you eat baby food.
[191:03.45]No, I don't.
[191:04.47]This is beef jerky.
[191:06.51]Yeah!
[191:08.31]Do you like me?
[191:11.22]There's an old bone in here.
[191:19.36]Link?
[191:29.71]Looks like I'm... I'm like dipping tobacco.
[191:32.85]I promise I'm not.
[191:42.54]Free button?
[191:42.88]Do it in a certain order?
[192:12.42]it's another energy barrier I'm getting the same kind of readings as before yeah do you see a switch anywhere nearby I do alright we're gonna go uh what's the one on the very end purple that's how you do it got the last key that's it now you should be able to access the console
[192:47.43]MonkaS trapped.
[192:48.47]MonkaS, he's trapped.
[192:49.41]Should I make my own MonkaS?
[192:53.29]Like, you know what I mean?
[192:56.34]Here.
[192:59.46]We'll pull this as an emote.
[193:17.17]Oh, yes.
[193:18.31]Mr. Trebek, I'll take ways to stall so he can put more food in his mouth for 100, please.
[193:22.56]Thank you.
[193:27.34]I want to get up there.
[193:27.92]Okay.
[193:47.74]Oh, no, that was... Okay, I was already there.
[193:54.66]You're eating expensive meat.
[193:58.70]I like this brand.
[194:01.71]Dude, just buy a Slim Jim.
[194:03.41]Just buy an Ultra Slim Jim.
[194:06.17]They're like a dollar at the gas station.
[194:08.45]No, no, I don't want to eat... Like, I don't want to eat that.
[194:11.45]This is my brand.
[194:17.43]Some people wear, like, Louis Vuitton sneakers.
[194:20.87]I eat Crave chili lime beef jerky.
[194:36.88]This is the wrong way.
[194:44.95]Why are you addicted to advertising?
[194:48.77]Is it advertising if I'm just recommending?
[194:52.57]What if this is just me recommending something?
[194:54.31]I'm not advertising, I'm just recommending something.
[195:00.46]Is that an ad?
[195:01.72]Is it?
[195:09.64]If it is, I'll take it back.
[195:17.50]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:18.96]Hold on.
[195:19.78]Here's the thing, though.
[195:21.74]I've never been paid to tell you guys anything like this.
[195:25.45]Only me has... I'm advertising to you.
[195:28.51]Nobody else has threw me.
[195:30.41]I've never been paid to advertise to you guys.
[195:31.77]I just do it for me.
[195:34.05]Because I'm advertising to you.
[195:35.76]Right?
[195:36.98]Okay.
[195:43.14]You can't lie about that, Jerma.
[195:44.62]MonkaS.
[195:45.50]I've never done a paid stream before, ever.
[195:47.56]Not one time.
[195:48.52]Literally.
[195:49.28]Literally.
[195:49.68]And I mean that word like I don't literally... Literally, it's never happened once.
[195:55.00]So.
[195:55.89]I mean.
[195:56.87]What do you want me to say?
[196:05.09]I've never done a paid stream.
[196:06.79]When?
[196:09.07]I've never accepted money for a stream.
[196:15.45]What about brain fluid?

[197:03.57]Sometimes when I eat chili lime from Crave, I have to sneeze.
[197:08.08]Does that happen to anybody else?
[197:12.08]I mean, people think I'm making that up.
[197:14.62]See?
[197:15.62]Why does that happen?
[197:24.14]Is it one in your nose?
[197:25.92]You're allergic to it.
[197:39.25]Whoa, it's a yellow refractor and a big one.
[197:41.83]Good going, Mega Man.
[197:43.07]We can use this to power all sorts of things.
[197:46.35]Well, it's a nice small little fix to the flutter, but I wonder what we can use it for.
[197:52.79]Let's think of something we can do with it.
[198:06.80]Uber voice?
[198:07.64]No, no, no, no, no.
[198:08.84]That's radio car commercial voice.
[198:12.66]The grenade kit was used to make grenade arms.
[198:16.02]Ooh.
[198:18.42]It's grenade bombs.
[198:19.55]If a bomb hits a wall, it will bounce off.
[198:22.05]So...
[198:24.69]me here rat s rat s mega man I came up with something the spring set was used to make jump springs interesting this time springs that will increase your jumping power now you'll be able to get to all sorts of places you weren't able to get to before be sure you put them on okay let me take a look at that weapon this is that one where's the grenade launcher
[198:56.78]Splash Mine.
[199:00.72]Grenade Arm.
[199:01.58]Kind of... Let me try it.
[199:05.49]Did I try it?
[199:11.45]No.
[199:11.93]I already have this good one on.
[199:16.31]I mean... I upgraded this one three times.
[199:22.06]Do what you want laughing my ass off.
[199:26.36]Okay.

[199:36.13]So I'm doing that for free right now.
[199:38.55]How much do you think it would... What would it cost to be paid by a company to do that?
[199:42.99]Am I missing out on a bunch of money or something?
[199:46.11]Should I, like, do that?
[199:47.21]Am I missing out on just a bunch of money?
[199:52.26]How much money am I missing out on?
[200:06.07]Like, ten thousand.
[200:09.31]Literally thousands.

[202:07.36]Let me see.
[202:08.68]Carnations.
[202:10.02]Carnation meanings.
[202:14.13]Light red carnations represent aberration.
[202:17.31]Dark red is deep love.
[202:20.17]White carnations represent good luck.
[202:25.16]Right, there's different kind of... Does it have to be a red rose?
[202:28.42]What are you talking about?
[202:33.99]I've never heard of this.
[202:34.85]How have you never heard of different carnations?
[202:36.81]Different flowers mean different things on different occasions.
[202:39.37]What?
[202:42.98]Just discuss that for a little, you know?
[203:00.28]You're making shit up.

[203:38.01]Fence is gone, dude.
[203:39.66]What?

[205:13.46]Is that all it means?
[205:17.22]No.
[205:19.24]It just means a wealthy area?
[205:21.62]A rich area?

[225:40.71]Huh?
[225:43.41]What did you just say?
[225:48.33]It's red rose of red.
[225:50.01]I said talent.
[225:52.93]Did you just say what I think you said?
[225:54.91]Could you repeat that?
[225:59.39]Yeah.
[226:00.80]I said talent.
[226:04.42]That's what I thought.
[226:06.36]Never mind then.
[226:09.88]Just kidding.
[226:10.24]Can I have the item that you're going to give me?
[226:12.87]Something's missing.
[226:15.23]I'm red.
[226:15.49]You need red paint?
[226:18.25]How do I use the jumpsprings?
[226:19.89]Are they just on?
[226:44.82]We'll have to do something special.
[226:45.80]Equip the jump springs.
[226:51.25]Okay, there we go.
[226:52.99]Oh my goodness, that's huge.
[226:56.93]This is huge!
[226:57.33]Alright, I'm going... I'm going... Not east.
[226:58.81]I need to go... I'm... Where am I going?
[227:15.37]I don't think I can go anywhere else.
[227:16.35]There's no gate here.
[227:17.63]I'm looking for a sub-gate thing.
[227:20.95]Wait, can I get up here?
[227:30.40]Oh, fuck, I just jumped over the whole building.
[227:31.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:32.30]Get back up there.
[227:51.60]What?!
[227:52.46]Alright.
[227:54.38]Guys, I don't think this exists.
[227:59.46]If it doesn't exist, I'm out.
[228:01.10]Jump over the fence where the boat is?
[228:17.45]Jump to the chest in that cave.
[228:19.47]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[228:20.29]I know.
[228:20.51]I will.
[228:22.47]Just ran over a kid.
[228:25.57]Want to make sure you're aware of that.
[228:27.05]You just want to make sure that you know that you just ran over a child.
[228:30.81]Alright, roll.
[228:32.31]Let's get out of here.
[228:46.51]Take me to... Where the hell do I want to go?
[228:55.02]It said up down, right?
[228:56.60]I already did the card ruins.
[229:03.12]Data?
[229:07.24]I had to do it, I'm sorry.
[229:15.97]What should I do now?
[229:16.57]What are you going to use the yellow refractor for?
[229:19.65]Let's think of some way to use it.
[229:22.79]Remember the sub-gates aren't the only ruins on the island.
[229:29.63]Have you been inside any of the others?
[229:31.94]I think so.
[229:33.40]I knew a digger as good as you wouldn't miss him.
[229:36.92]Did you find anything good inside?
[229:38.44]Losing control of the steering wheel dance.
[229:47.38]Now that looks very, that looks intentional to me.
[229:51.52]That's like, here we, here we, here we go!
[229:53.02]And then you rip to the right and then the car goes... Um... Alright, so what do I do with the yellow refractor?
[229:59.12]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[230:01.28]Move back to downtown.
[230:15.15]Alright, let's talk.
[230:18.09]Never mind.
[230:35.48]Broken motor?
[230:36.92]Broken propeller?
[230:37.72]Broken motor?
[230:40.64]Can I fix one of these boats?
[230:47.40]Do I need anything else?
[230:53.77]Kick the garbage bins, Jeremiah.
[230:58.73]Roll!
[230:59.05]Can you fix this?
[231:01.45]Stop!
[231:01.57]Stop!
[231:04.31]Stop!
[231:04.59]Tried.
[231:17.02]Uh, item development.
[231:19.80]Propeller and a... Come on.
[231:22.22]Ooh.
[231:24.04]Broken motor, broken propeller, and broken cleaner used to make the vacuum arm.
[231:30.23]This arm's a little different.
[231:31.97]You can't use it to attack with, but you can use it to easily gather up scattered refractor shards.
[231:39.97]This... That's horrible.
[231:49.86]That's the farming arm.
[231:54.18]Please, use this to clean up your car.
[232:00.16]I could go back in here.
[232:01.65]Was it down here?
[232:02.37]This is the original dungeon, right?
[232:05.93]Right?
[232:07.75]I'm right, aren't I?
[232:16.26]Right?
[232:25.49]Don't MonkaS me right now.
[232:27.01]This is where I need to be, right?
[232:31.47]Wasn't there a way to go?
[232:35.65]Wasn't there a thing I could do in this dungeon?
[232:45.84]Don't RatS me right now.
[233:12.46]So high level for this Alright Is this the way?
[233:31.59]I haven't explored it.
[233:33.29]Yeah, this is it.
[233:38.66]Tons of money.
[233:49.39]Alright, new place.
[233:57.39]Rain world waiting room.
[233:59.27]No, nope, no, nope, no, no, no.
[234:06.14]It's trapped!
[234:14.62]I wish I had that vacuum on right now.
[234:18.45]I haven't been in here, but let's explore.
[234:23.19]Elder bone waiting room.
[234:24.59]Nope, no.
[234:32.48]One day I'm just gonna turn the stream on and I'm gonna be in a fucking actual doctor's office waiting room.
[234:36.10]And then what the hell are you gonna say?
[234:38.22]What are you gonna say to that?
[234:41.43]Oh, waiting, waiting, doc, waiting room.
[234:43.67]Waiting room?
[234:44.45]Oh, no, it doesn't compute.
[234:47.65]That's all that's in here?
[234:48.37]Are you kidding me?
[234:53.70]That's it?
[235:12.83]Sometimes I feel like I'm your guy's mother at dinner.
[235:16.61]This is what we're eating today.
[235:19.43]I made peas, carrots, and chicken breast.
[235:22.41]McDonald's waiting room.
[235:27.45]This is what we're eating today.
[235:33.06]Cheese and shells waiting room.
[235:36.98]Son?
[235:40.23]We're having cheese and carrots today, and soup.
[235:41.73]You can't have macaroni and cheese every day.
[235:50.96]You can't have cheese and shells every day.
[235:53.30]You can't have pizza every single day.
[236:07.62]And sometimes, sometimes I don't even understand some of your recommendations.
[236:11.46]The things you want to see.
[236:14.02]A brick of Velveeta uncooked waiting room.
[236:17.91]Why do you want to eat that?
[236:19.21]You don't want to eat that.
[236:33.28]If you do, then you're fucking crazy.
[236:38.01]You're gonna... You're gonna have diarrhea for a month.
[236:54.60]Imagine digesting a brick of uncooked, like, just velvety cheese.
[236:58.66]A whole brick.
[237:00.67]No, no, no.
[237:00.95]I'm not talking about the single-serve ones.
[237:02.43]I'm talking about the family size.
[237:07.01]The one that looks like a joke gold bar from the old movies.
[237:15.66]I want items, not this shit.
[237:26.15]More to explore.
[237:37.45]Eat Velveeta on screen.
[237:42.70]You know, I'll give you a quick little story.
[237:45.84]Alright, so...
[237:48.70]Kim and I made macaroni and cheese one night, in quotes, from scratch, right?
[237:52.46]We didn't get it out of a box.
[237:53.54]We got a bunch of Velveeta.
[237:56.13]We got some other cheeses.
[237:58.07]We got elbow macaroni, and we got some spices.
[238:01.89]It was like a little date thing.
[238:02.87]Let's make our own mac and cheese.
[238:04.11]Great.
[238:05.55]And if you guys don't know about Velveeta, that's going to kill me.
[238:10.14]Well, it will if you eat too much of it, but I'm talking about the game.
[238:15.18]Velveeta is so heavy and so thick.
[238:19.73]When you're hungry and you make macaroni and cheese with Velveeta, you always are like, you know what?
[238:25.02]Fuck it.
[238:25.30]Let's put half the brick in.
[238:26.94]Yeah.
[238:27.34]Yep.
[238:28.04]That's what I want to do.
[238:29.82]Don't do that.
[238:30.88]Don't.
[238:32.04]Put in.
[238:33.88]Oh my god.
[238:34.64]Oh my god.
[238:34.98]Oh my god.
[238:35.38]Oh my god.
[238:52.20]He's dead?
[238:59.33]He's killing everything.
[239:00.41]He's coming back.
[239:15.40]He's coming back.
[239:15.78]He's coming back.
[239:16.18]He's coming back.
[239:16.62]He's coming back.
[239:17.02]He's coming for me.
[239:22.71]Oh!
[239:34.18]What the fuck is that move?
[239:42.51]Dead?
[239:43.99]Oh!
[240:00.94]Oh my fuck.
[240:02.58]I freaked him out.
[240:04.64]Why is he still alive?
[240:17.62]I'm not a deuce.
[240:30.64]Got it.
[240:31.34]Get the big ones at least.
[240:37.02]Okay, that was fucking crazy.
[240:45.22]Alright, the cheese, right?
[240:46.90]So if you use more than a half a brick of Velveeta, it's really tempting.
[240:51.78]Because you just plump it in there and it just melts.
[240:56.78]But that shit turns into cement.
[241:04.82]And when you start to mix it up and it starts to lose some of its liquid content, it turns into this thick cement-like substance.
[241:14.11]It's crazy how just too much it is.
[241:20.47]Fuck you, Jerma.
[241:24.45]I have a fucking mirror spell on tonight.
[241:26.22]You know what that means.
[241:33.55]Link?
[241:37.95]Link and Link.
[241:38.58]Link and Link.
[241:39.16]Link and Link.
[241:39.74]Link and Link.
[241:40.36]Link and Link.
[241:40.96]Link and Link.
[241:44.10]I can't even... Hold on.
[242:05.39]Okay, this is... What?
[242:13.88]That's it?
[242:41.86]happened.
[242:43.54]That's why the links are going away.
[242:45.80]No, they're gonna be concentrated in the central location that's gonna be easy to pull up.
[242:55.62]Hold on, wait.
[242:56.86]Secret.
[243:03.31]It's that little rabbit.
[243:09.67]What's a little rabbit?
[243:11.25]Oh, whatever it is.
[243:12.11]It's dead.
[243:17.27]Wings or links?
[243:18.17]Both.
[243:19.51]I'm just going to be a regular boring streamer now that just goes... Hmm.
[244:00.42]Gaming viewers.
[244:06.36]Viewers.
[244:07.14]That's a big jump.
[244:22.13]This place is huge.
[244:24.75]I gotta explore all of it.
[244:26.57]Every last piece.
[244:30.10]And no, mom, I'm not going to bed.
[244:32.08]Where the hell am I?
[244:39.90]He still hasn't figured out what to do with the boat?
[244:42.11]Well, I've only been there once.
[244:43.27]Alright, let's go... Um... Let's go... I'm gonna sneeze again.
[244:56.79]Go to bed, Jeremy.
[244:57.53]Mom said.
[244:59.27]No.
[244:59.67]Okay.
[245:08.89]Jeremy Harold Elderton.
[245:10.47]Get off that computer right now.
[245:12.21]God, Mom's just never got it, right?
[245:17.75]Like, I can't stop.
[245:19.69]I have to get to this.
[245:20.79]I can't pause the game.
[245:21.69]I can't stop.
[245:23.09]And I'm going to lose, like, two hours of progress.
[245:25.03]Mom, you don't get it.
[245:27.74]I don't care how far you are in the game.
[245:30.08]You've got school tomorrow.
[245:33.44]That game can play.
[245:34.22]9 less 10,000 bucks.
[246:09.98]You're killing the bunny.
[246:11.04]Stop.
[246:21.59]Wait, I'm back over in this dungeon?
[246:25.59]Oh, I could jump from there.
[246:26.95]Alright, was there anything in this place that I could jump to?
[246:29.04]This place is huge.
[246:31.04]Holy shit, it's been four hours?
[246:34.24]Yeah, I mean, I'm...
[246:38.79]Okay, I need some anecdotal.
[246:42.51]Harold Elbertson, 985.
[246:44.01]Thanks for literally stealing and leaking my entire name.
[246:47.90]Appreciate it.
[246:50.22]Anytime you guys are sitting there about to talk, or if you have something to say, or you're in a conversation, anybody ever do this?
[246:56.10]You don't say anything yet, you're kind of just hanging out, and you make this weird noise where you go... Does that happen to anybody else?
[247:10.62]You go like, yeah, yeah.
[247:14.14]That was probably tomorrow afternoon.
[247:19.12]Yeah, I think so.
[247:23.64]Or it's even higher than that.
[247:27.54]It's like... Okay, good.
[247:31.16]Thank you, sir.
[247:55.65]Dude, you're a psycho.
[247:56.63]I saw at least 10 people say yes.
[248:12.58]Those are all Jerma alt accounts.
[248:13.86]They got me.
[248:26.03]Fix my posture?
[248:27.16]I'm... I have to... my posture has to be fixed.
[248:31.24]I have this... ooh, right there.
[248:34.86]I have a brace on that means... no, I was already up there.
[248:38.74]I got that already.
[248:41.85]I'm wearing a brace that makes it so I can't.
[248:45.73]Now I'm lost in here.
[248:52.59]It wasn't this way, this is... I gotta get out of this.
[248:59.93]Over here.
[249:06.95]Yeah, the brace that I'm wearing, it means I can't physically put my shoulders forward.
[249:13.03]I can't.
[249:13.62]There'll be tension on my back and chest and stuff and stomach.
[249:21.00]And it also puts a little bit of pressure underneath my rib cage, which makes me feel a little bit better.
[249:30.89]Roller board.
[249:31.59]I thought you were just strapped into your boomer seat.
[249:50.15]alright so we can go we went this way let's pack it back up and go up what's up alright so when I did this because remember I this my ps2 is going through a capture card which is then upscaling it to 1080p right I have a device that does that
[250:13.46]For that operation to happen, it takes about one full second.
[250:17.19]So I just got terrified, because on my left monitor, there's a small pre- there's a preview window over here of the stream.
[250:24.93]So when I went like this, almost two full seconds later, I thought my other monitor blue-screened.
[250:31.70]I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[250:33.46]It was very, very scary.
[250:42.17]That happens a lot.
[250:46.72]That shit happens all the time.
[250:48.67]Especially when I'm playing an old console that has to go through the capture cards.
[251:00.92]I Slenderman myself.
[251:03.38]Alright, what have we got?
[251:05.34]Chest here.
[251:07.66]Chest on the other side, too.
[251:09.40]Alright, how do I get over that way?
[251:11.34]Can I make the jump?
[251:12.82]There's two chests over there.
[251:13.82]Are you kidding me?
[251:16.26]Can we just do a making pasta stream?
[251:17.68]I don't know how to make pasta.
[251:18.94]Buster unit!
[251:20.99]What makes you think I know how to make pasta?
[251:22.79]Oh, I open up the box of the straw.
[251:27.63]Of the, what could be hay.
[251:29.76]And boil it for seven minutes.
[251:47.35]You said you made it from scratch.
[251:50.35]No, me and Kim did not make elbow macaroni from scratch.
[251:56.67]I thought I blue-screened again.
[252:00.84]I'm saying that we made macaroni and cheese from scratch.
[252:04.00]Because most macaroni and cheese is out of a box.
[252:06.20]You know, you get the craft.
[252:10.48]You got, like, a cracker barrel.
[252:12.92]Most people make it out of the box.
[252:18.99]Did you guys make your own elbow macaroni pasta?
[252:21.97]No, you don't.
[252:40.64]You guys roll out your own pasta every- No, some of you guys aren't even old enough to drive, okay?
[252:46.25]No way.
[252:47.13]You were making your own pasta from scratch.
[253:05.15]I'm 24, you're old enough to drive.
[253:07.15]No, it's not even old enough.
[253:08.35]You should get your license at 25.
[253:09.53]Did you see these fucking psychos that are on our roads?
[253:21.24]I didn't go over there.
[253:31.97]You don't make your own damn pasta.
[253:33.58]You don't make your own pasta.
[253:37.08]You roll up the dough and... Now you're gonna tell me you make your own pizza dough too.
[253:41.50]No you don't.
[253:41.96]You go to fucking Domino's.
[253:44.03]Like everybody else does.
[253:46.83]I don't care what your Tinder profile says.
[253:49.87]You don't do that.
[254:06.26]Bounce him!
[254:06.62]Come on, bounce!
[254:15.05]It only has to rise once.
[254:19.05]Pizza dough is so easy.
[254:33.22]Lazy Millennial.
[254:39.64]Make my own pasta every time.
[254:43.99]You make your own bread too?
[254:57.70]No, it doesn't count if somebody made it already in a bread maker and you eat it.
[255:12.27]Yes, it does.
[255:12.73]No, you didn't make it!
[255:14.27]What?
[255:15.66]You can't, hold on.
[255:16.76]I make my own bread is not the same as I eat the bread that somebody else made at a bread maker.
[255:22.72]That's not you making it.
[255:26.60]What?
[255:26.82]You didn't make it.
[255:29.58]You didn't do it.
[255:37.25]What, it's a bread maker?
[255:40.45]It's the thing that you- I don't know!
[255:42.13]It's the box that sits on the... You know... You can't- You didn't build that.
[255:52.49]Oh, you guys are making me fucking laugh.
[255:54.47]What do you mean, what's a bread maker?
[255:57.50]It's the thing you make bread in.
[256:00.58]It makes bread- What do you roll- What is this, like the fucking 1400s?
[256:06.90]You making bread over, like, hot coals in your backyard?
[256:23.04]You guys definitely make bread and it rises so... Oh, you guys are fucking awesome.
[256:36.20]You're trying to say oven.
[256:42.53]There's dodge right there.
[256:58.40]Making bread in the microwave.
[257:00.26]Oh my god.
[257:00.98]You put the dough in the pan and then put the pan in the oven.
[257:06.99]Yeah.
[257:07.87]I bet your bread is real gross.
[257:23.71]I'm just kidding.
[257:25.39]I'm just kidding.
[257:36.48]Headlights?
[257:39.28]Alright, no more gaslighting.
[257:41.22]Alright, I'm done.
[257:43.06]No more.
[257:43.54]I'm done.
[257:51.91]You can't insult chat's imaginary bread.
[257:59.79]We gotta do a public apology?
[258:31.76]Hi guys.
[258:33.73]So, a lot of you may have
[258:37.43]I've been aware of some of the things that I may have said on stream recently.
[258:43.55]I really don't mean that.
[258:45.97]I didn't mean that at all.
[258:49.66]I talked about, if those of you don't know, I talked about one of my chat members' bread and I said it was probably gross.
[258:58.44]And I don't know anything about that person's bread.
[259:00.06]I was frustrated with the video game I was playing.
[259:01.80]I said in direct quotes, you have gross bread.
[259:05.79]And I got a lot of flack for it.
[259:08.91]And... I just want to say... Sorry, I guess.
[259:16.04]I mean, apparently day to day we're mad about it.
[259:21.38]And yeah, I just kind of want to go back to the kind of way it was beforehand.
[259:30.67]And I'm very sorry.
[259:37.13]Uh, so we'll see you next time on stream.
[259:42.12]Thanks for everything.
[259:44.20]I'm really close to the camera.
[259:47.08]The end.
[259:55.80]I guess either you are or you aren't.
[260:02.26]Oh, the music's still playing.
[260:06.55]I forgive you.
[260:07.27]Thank you.
[260:07.99]I'm glad.
[260:13.45]You have mic volume?
[260:14.91]Whatever.
[260:17.13]Keep the music?
[260:18.10]No!
[260:18.56]What?
[260:18.78]Apology rejected.
[260:39.13]Well, here we are again.
[260:43.01]I just want to say from the bottom of my heart that I'm very sorry about the sorry that I did before.
[260:51.65]That it wasn't up to the standard that I should have done it at.
[260:56.16]And if you
[261:03.43]Thank you everybody for your support I want to say I apologize again for all the things that have a nasty things I said about that person Fred I'm very sorry
[261:28.34]Better?
[261:29.58]That's better, right?
[261:30.22]Like, everything's better now?
[261:31.68]Everything is better?
[261:44.95]Apologize to the bread.
[261:52.11]Holy fuck, I didn't even mean to do that.
[261:54.21]I'm gonna die.
[261:54.99]Alright, no more bread jokes.
[261:56.63]No more, like, apology bread jokes.
[261:59.25]Uh, I haven't saved in, like, an hour.
[262:01.29]This would be really bad if I died here.
[262:02.67]I don't have any more, uh... Goddammit.
[262:12.27]This is bad.
[262:14.50]How could I be all out of... of gerbil water?
[262:20.22]How could I be out of it?
[262:36.82]You better not be lying about shwee, oh yeah I did say that.
[262:41.54]Cue the music again.
[262:58.07]anything on this side that I didn't see ah what is this old shield holy oh my god I love all the little secret little trinkets that are in this game
[263:21.50]Waiting for that shitty video tomorrow.
[263:24.76]No, that was like a fake thing.
[263:26.58]It was a joke video.
[263:27.94]That was a joke that I was doing for the stream.
[263:34.17]There's no video coming up tomorrow.
[263:44.27]That was a joke.
[263:45.45]That was a little... You're on camera right now.
[263:47.72]Look around you.
[263:49.37]Yep, you're on camera.
[263:51.17]It was a joke for the stream, and yep, you're on camera.
[264:01.46]You got pranked.
[264:02.98]There's one there, behind too.
[264:18.58]Die already!
[264:19.16]Okay, let's get back up here.
[264:29.14]I've not gone this way yet.
[264:30.34]I need health.
[264:32.87]I can't do any more exploring without more health.
[264:35.61]This is just dangerous to do this.
[264:37.41]This is a bad idea.
[264:38.17]I'm gonna get tapped once by these.
[264:52.86]Am I going to stream the sequel?
[264:54.36]The sequel is in a case directly behind me.
[264:58.26]I own Mega Man Legends 2.
[265:00.42]And the answer to that question is absolutely yes.
[265:04.30]Absolutely.
[265:11.88]Contractor shard, 780.
[265:13.26]Are you going to stream the Sonic movie from your phone?
[265:36.08]Thank god for the health.
[265:39.54]Oi.
[265:44.27]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[265:45.17]I need to- I have to leave.
[266:08.97]What?
[266:14.41]Oh!
[266:17.21]Let him through.
[266:17.67]Let him through.
[266:18.27]He probably... Alright, now I know it's not safe.
[266:21.46]It's not safe.
[266:22.78]It's unsafe.
[266:29.67]Now?
[266:30.57]Now.
[266:31.77]Now.
[266:32.83]Now.
[266:33.67]Run now.
[266:34.85]Run now.
[266:36.18]Run now.
[266:37.40]Run now.
[266:38.54]Run now.
[266:39.70]Run now.
[266:40.86]Run now.
[266:42.72]I'm alive, right?
[266:43.30]Okay, bye.
[266:43.90]I'm leaving.
[266:44.70]I'm done.
[266:45.63]I'm done.
[266:45.97]I'm done.
[266:46.25]I'm going home.
[266:47.99]I'm going home.
[266:48.99]I'm going home.
[266:51.33]I'm going home.
[266:53.26]There's time.
[266:53.66]It's gonna leave.
[266:54.58]I'm just gonna go in the way.
[266:55.32]I'm gonna call Roll and say, Roll, come pick me up.
[266:57.50]I'm done with the exploring.
[267:00.86]Oh my god!
[267:01.44]There's something in this room.
[267:05.14]There's two things in this room.
[267:08.80]Please drop health.
[267:10.44]Please drop health.
[267:11.76]Please drop health.
[267:13.20]Please don't shoot at me.
[267:14.00]Drop health.
[267:17.18]Okay, it was fun when you dropped health.
[267:20.12]When you don't shoot at me and you dropped health.
[267:21.72]That was a really fun part of the game.
[267:25.79]Did you drop health?
[267:26.29]That was fun when you did that.
[267:27.25]What the hell?
[267:30.26]No, no health.
[267:30.86]Okay.
[267:37.74]I don't know how to get out of here.
[267:39.14]I don't know which way to go is.
[267:42.64]Which way?
[267:42.92]Is it this way through that?
[267:43.92]I don't know how to get over here.
[267:53.27]To the left?
[267:54.21]Left and up?
[267:55.63]Or around through this tunnel?
[268:04.86]Left and up.
[268:06.62]The tunnel?
[268:08.04]No, it's not that.
[268:08.74]Is it through the tunnel?
[268:10.08]There's shit in this tunnel.
[268:11.12]There's stuff in this tunnel.
[268:15.17]There's an enemy in the tunnel.
[268:22.31]I know there's an enemy in the tunnel.
[269:27.92]Is the thing all over again?
[270:06.16]I don't know what to do.
[270:47.49]Where is it?
[271:00.72]Okay.
[271:07.81]Holy fuck.
[271:13.63]I thought I... My perspective was weird.
[271:30.69]What?
[271:31.35]What?
[271:31.79]Why is he here?
[271:32.43]Why is he in here?
[271:34.03]What?
[271:35.31]What the fuck?
[271:36.07]Why is that guy in here?
[271:36.99]I thought I was dead on the first hit.
[271:39.47]And then I got back up and... Oh no.
[271:43.55]That was like 45 fucking minutes ago.
[271:45.79]Oh my god.
[271:52.80]Why is that guy still in there?
[271:54.53]And he spawned right... He was right next to me.
[272:04.81]Oh, this is so bad.
[272:06.27]This is so bad.
[272:10.40]That was at least 30 to 40 straight minutes.
[272:21.97]Oh, come on!
[272:25.06]Come on!
[272:25.84]I don't even have to Bootsy Quip.
[272:27.54]That's how you know how long ago that was.
[272:29.24]Oh, fuck that enemy!
[272:30.36]What's it doing in there?
[272:31.68]It's like the boss that takes 5,000 hits and he's right next to me and I... Oh, I'm so mad.
[272:42.63]What the hell?
[272:44.09]That's so stupid!
[272:45.53]That's stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!
[272:55.56]He was a boss!
[272:56.42]The guys don't- The bosses don't respawn and now I gotta go through all this shit again?
[273:00.38]Then I had all those items and I don't even know where everything even is!
[273:03.50]Oh, fuck the bunnies!
[273:20.02]Get me outta here!
[273:20.52]Go!
[273:30.33]I could have left.
[273:31.13]I probably wouldn't even go on the right.
[273:33.33]Oh, it's so frustrating.
[273:34.83]10,000.
[273:42.00]I was here for like a fucking hour, mate.
[273:44.42]I was here for an hour.
[274:10.67]Didn't have anything... I tried to leave!
[274:13.26]But there's only one... There's only one fucking way to leave these goddamn places!
[274:23.62]Genuine despair.
[274:24.82]Yeah, this sucks.
[274:26.16]I'm so sad that I had to do this again.
[274:28.40]I'm gonna miss one of the items.
[274:30.00]I know it.
[274:34.32]I'm gonna fight that stupid asshole again.
[274:44.88]I'm just picking up chests.
[274:53.55]Any chests that I missed?
[275:00.22]Nothing?
[275:00.48]No?
[275:00.66]One right here.
[275:03.30]Oh, shit.
[275:11.59]Millennial enraged.
[275:15.97]Oh, this sucks!
[275:20.04]You can call it whatever you want.
[275:21.96]This is... This is bogus.
[275:42.32]I got cool items too.
[275:43.72]I was going to go back and turn in and I can't even do that now.
[275:47.10]And now I'm rushing to try and get through this crap.
[276:07.17]Why does this do 50% of your health?
[276:09.09]Why?
[276:20.88]Now this fucking green crab guy is gonna chase me the whole way down.
[276:33.67]Where the hell am I?
[276:46.66]Rapid fire barrel.
[276:47.94]That's so cool!
[276:49.02]I wish I had the other stuff!
[277:04.78]Keeping an eye for the holes in the walls.
[277:06.48]Yeah, I collected almost all of them.
[277:09.62]In the pre-meltdown run.
[277:12.04]And I'm just running by them.
[277:13.18]Is there a cannon on that wall?
[277:20.03]Oh.
[277:37.45]I need a drill for that okay I have to go through this again don't I oh
[278:07.54]Oh, this is bad.
[278:09.00]Oh, shit.
[278:12.36]I have to do this again.
[278:15.40]Just avoid getting hit.
[278:16.46]I didn't even know I could stop here.
[278:22.02]I didn't think there was enough room.
[278:27.38]I'm so mad.
[278:28.68]I'm holding it in.
[278:50.07]Okay.
[278:50.31]Everything's fine.
[278:53.93]I need to find that shield.
[278:57.70]And I'm gonna go do the boat thing.
[278:59.16]That sounds like a plan, right?
[279:06.28]Did somebody just write TF2 waiting room?
[279:10.46]Like six years later.
[279:25.55]Been waiting a long time.
[279:29.73]That had bad upload speed.
[279:40.16]Halt!
[279:42.62]Give me my shield.
[279:45.18]There it is.
[279:45.88]Yes.
[279:46.50]Alright.
[279:48.76]Now get me the hell out of here.
[279:57.38]Wait.
[279:58.26]Check this.
[280:01.44]No!
[280:02.10]This is where this guy is.
[280:04.80]Is it?
[280:06.92]Wait.
[280:08.63]Okay.
[280:09.07]I remember this part.
[280:14.23]This hole's in here.
[280:25.04]Didn't kill him in one hit.
[280:34.31]Bro, you gotta make me some new shit.
[280:37.83]Alright, there was something in here, right?
[280:42.51]Shiny object.
[280:43.35]Alright, I almost got them all.
[280:47.07]Was there anything else down here?
[280:49.69]Can you remember?
[280:50.27]I think there was.
[281:15.57]Just give me the big one.
[281:17.37]Alright, just you?
[281:32.18]We're just here to watch them suffer.
[281:33.90]Wait, did you even say that?
[281:35.02]What did you write?
[281:35.62]What did you just write?
[281:41.90]What did you write?
[281:44.28]Can I get someone to read that back, please?
[281:51.21]Well, I have to Tron Bone game.
[281:52.69]I do not have to Tron Bone game.
[281:54.95]I actually didn't even know that AI game existed.
[282:12.56]Flip him.
[282:14.66]Flip him!
[282:15.14]Flip him!
[282:27.54]He said you should have left the stuck robot getting hit to suffer.
[282:35.04]What the hell?
[282:36.41]What a psycho.
[282:38.39]Oh my god, that's horrible.
[282:59.34]Even more shit.
[283:06.02]It's $2 on PS3 right now.
[283:10.54]Are these games even on?
[283:13.54]You can only get this on PlayStation 2, right?
[283:23.06]No?
[283:27.95]You can get this on PSN as well?
[283:30.63]Oh.
[283:30.79]That's pretty cool.
[283:33.59]Penlight, got it.
[283:40.66]There's an N64?
[283:41.88]Is there really?
[283:43.02]Wait, why do I think that that's not bullshit?
[283:51.52]Alright, I've done everything I can do.
[283:53.80]Time to leave.
[284:03.32]I got the penlight.
[284:04.88]Got all the stuff.
[284:05.57]I'm at full health.
[284:06.67]I don't need to get upset about anything.
[284:09.05]We're just gonna go, go, go, go, go.
[284:12.13]We're just gonna go, go, go, go, go.
[284:25.03]He's going to get upset.
[284:25.91]He's going to get upset.
[284:27.25]Here he comes.
[284:27.89]Pepe laugh.
[284:29.15]He's going to get... Alright.
[284:35.73]Left, left.
[284:36.27]Here it comes.
[284:46.40]Pepe laugh.
[284:47.16]Here it comes.
[284:47.90]The roller board, though, wasn't down here.
[284:55.07]What was the roller board?
[284:55.99]No, I got it, didn't I?
[284:59.49]That was the first thing I got.
[285:05.20]Did I have it?
[285:06.88]Buster unit.
[285:07.54]That was the one I didn't have.
[285:08.32]Alright.
[285:09.50]I'm okay.
[285:09.92]I'm relaxed.
[285:13.21]Because I can never have it.
[285:24.61]You're the one that skips and gets things done around here.
[285:35.65]That's true.
[285:36.09]Alright, time to get out.
[285:39.77]Let's get out of here.
[285:44.15]The Adventures of Trombone.
[285:46.02]Wait, let's check over here too.
[285:55.45]I see a ladder.
[286:04.67]Nice.
[286:06.15]Ah, yes.
[286:06.99]Okay.
[286:07.67]Call the taxi.
[286:10.09]What is that?
[286:10.51]Oh, that's Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[286:27.88]Alright, roll.
[286:28.64]Make some items!
[286:30.92]Go!
[286:36.26]Rapid Fire Barrel was used to make Buster Part Machine Gun.
[286:39.74]Gotta shoot a lot of enemies at once.
[286:46.34]Nothing else?
[286:52.17]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[286:58.47]Let's check it out.
[287:08.70]Please save the game.
[287:09.74]I got it, man.
[287:10.80]Save the game.
[287:13.44]I'm dying.
[287:15.22]I got it!
[287:18.71]You lied about No More Heroes 2.
[287:19.93]No, I didn't.
[287:21.17]Because I haven't played it yet.
[287:30.04]Alright.
[287:32.74]Um, let's go back to town.
[287:34.22]Take me to downtown.
[287:37.98]I'm gonna go buy some upgrades.
[287:39.00]I lied about God Hand.
[287:50.05]No, I... I got like 60 games to play.
[287:53.26]There's so many video games I have.
[288:03.66]We want to go south.
[288:11.89]Skip this one.
[288:12.69]No, what?
[288:23.28]I'm playing it.
[288:35.69]Alright, let's do Buster Part.
[288:36.77]Equip.
[288:38.59]So we have... Plus one attack, two energy.
[288:42.68]Plus one energy, two range.
[288:43.94]Rapid Fire is just... That's it?
[288:46.42]Oh, Machine Gun.
[288:49.74]Energy three, rapid one.
[288:51.78]This is energy one, range two.
[289:04.55]Attack 1, Range 2.
[289:05.81]Attack 1, Energy 2.
[289:13.77]Energy 1.
[289:14.19]I'm going to replace this with Machina.
[289:18.73]That's Energy 3, Rapid 1.
[289:22.10]I lose the range there, but I'm going to be shooting out a ton of bullets.
[289:28.26]Now for Blast Unit.
[289:29.50]Attack 1, Energy 2.
[289:33.64]I could...
[289:35.95]Put this on.
[289:40.45]Or just keep that one on.
[289:43.14]That's pretty balanced.
[289:49.70]Oh, that's good to know.
[289:53.88]Alright, you.
[289:56.06]Talk to me.
[289:57.82]Items.
[289:58.52]Life gauge.
[289:59.46]Black jacket.
[290:01.08]Reduces all damage by one-fourth.
[290:03.50]Give it to me.
[290:03.98]Thank you.
[290:07.08]Kevlar jacket.
[290:08.70]Awww.
[290:10.74]Chameleon neck.
[290:11.61]Camouflage is used for a limited time.
[290:13.11]Hyper cartridge.
[290:16.45]Life gauge.
[290:21.69]Mic fart?
[290:22.37]What?
[290:25.11]What do you mean, fart?
[290:27.91]Fart on the mic.
[290:29.29]You farted on the mic.
[290:31.30]What are you talking about?
[290:37.93]Okay, I got the most health I can have.
[290:39.56]Extra pack here.
[290:43.20]Wait, let me make parts.
[290:44.38]Laser!
[290:45.38]Holy shit.
[290:46.00]Attack plus four.
[290:46.92]Turbo battery?
[290:57.08]Laser is plus four attack.
[290:58.60]That's crazy.
[291:00.24]I want it.
[291:10.27]I'm gonna buy Piper Cartridge.
[291:16.75]And... Chameleon Net or Extra Pack?
[291:26.44]I don't have enough of the Kevlar.
[291:33.12]Alright, let's go put this on.
[291:36.24]Refill the Canteen.
[291:40.85]Alright, buster parts.
[291:41.73]Here we go.
[291:42.97]This is energy three, rapid one, attack one, range.
[291:45.55]So we're going to replace, we're going to keep machine gun on.
[291:47.69]And we're going to put on laser.
[291:54.49]So we lose range, but we have a ton of bullets that come out and they all do a shitload of damage.
[292:03.50]Special items.
[292:05.38]Black jacket.
[292:06.34]Put it on.
[292:08.97]Yellow refractor.
[292:09.77]Blue refractor.
[292:11.24]Alright.
[292:14.82]Sounds good.
[292:19.32]What's with this whole farting thing?
[292:20.86]What are you guys talking about?
[292:27.91]What are you guys doing?
[292:29.53]Can I give the butt to the dog?
[292:37.85]Pause the stream.
[292:38.41]Somebody went to go get a drink.
[292:46.63]Thanks for reminding me.
[292:51.95]Alright.
[292:55.32]I have to go to the Closer Woods.
[292:59.40]Closer Woods.
[293:00.48]So that's right.
[293:01.50]That's north, and then all the way around into the Closer Woods.
[293:05.26]Right?
[293:06.70]Alright, now we go up again, and then right.
[293:37.33]Did he kick the can?
[293:38.07]He did!
[293:38.45]He kicked it into the bakery.
[293:47.29]Alright, how do I get there from here?
[293:51.59]Can I go up again?
[293:53.45]Yeah.
[294:11.39]Here we go.
[294:13.22]What do you think?
[294:14.82]Yes.
[294:15.92]That's what I thought.
[294:18.14]What were they thinking?
[294:19.60]Digging a big hole like that around the ruins.
[294:21.30]I wonder if anyone will ever be able to enter there again.
[294:24.56]Okay.
[294:27.64]So now we have to go through down to the Closer Woods.
[294:33.74]Can we look up a guide?
[294:34.87]No, no, no.
[294:35.47]Not yet.
[294:36.63]I'm going down to where another one of those refractors is.
[294:39.73]Closer Woods.
[294:44.27]I don't look up a guide yet.
[294:48.33]Although I can get up there now.
[294:55.25]A cricket?
[295:00.34]Empty.
[295:04.62]Safety helmet.
[295:08.30]Look at that.
[295:11.05]Faster.
[295:13.21]And it's a ton of damage.
[295:21.59]Put the helmet on?
[295:27.08]Fart into your facecam.
[295:28.56]Alright shut up.
[295:35.75]What is wrong with people?
[295:39.15]What is wrong with you?
[295:40.93]Why are you even saying that?
[295:47.73]Special weapons?
[295:48.79]No, it's not a fart.
[295:50.43]I can't even put the helmet on.
[295:53.97]Fart into your face, Kim.
[295:55.85]What are you even talking about?
[295:57.59]Somebody check on that guy.
[296:03.69]Is he alright?
[296:04.33]Alright, I gotta go around.
[296:17.07]Closer Woods.
[296:17.77]Okay, so this is... Yes, planes.
[296:22.64]Fuck, I did it again.
[296:24.52]Is this the Closer Woods?
[296:32.49]Okay, yes.
[296:33.41]So keep going.
[296:43.91]Cringe boomer, cringe boomer, cringe boomer, cringe boomer, cringe boomer, cringe boomer.
[296:48.49]Okay, um, this is it, right?
[297:00.52]This is the closer woods right here, because that, yeah, it's down here.
[297:03.64]So have I not done something in here?
[297:11.03]Wait, no, this is where I just was.
[297:16.63]What?
[297:22.55]What?
[297:24.09]Is it the other one?
[297:24.65]That's the main dungeon.
[297:28.73]Maybe I should talk to Grandpa.
[297:30.07]Oh, okay.
[297:30.49]It's the one that the pirates dug around.
[297:36.68]Go in here.
[297:41.26]Use the damn rocket!
[297:54.21]So is it around here?
[298:01.41]You can't enter it right now.
[298:02.85]Oh.
[298:04.39]It's above.
[298:09.40]Nothing here.
[298:12.40]Hmm.
[298:18.40]Oh.
[298:22.56]Hmm.
[298:27.98]Anybody know what to do?
[298:32.15]I have the big yellow crystal.
[298:36.39]Where's the one in Uptown?
[298:40.77]Uptown.
[298:42.07]I went to Uptown like three times.
[298:43.25]Alright, roll.
[298:47.01]Come get me.
[298:49.86]Back to the boat.
[298:56.28]I'm sorry, Mega Man, I can't get over there.
[298:57.76]Come on.
[298:59.68]Go to the boat.
[299:11.69]Boat, boat, boat, boat, boat, boat, boat.
[299:14.31]Alright, we'll go to the boat.
[299:16.42]I'll check the boat.
[299:20.12]This game sucks.
[299:21.28]It really doesn't, though.
[299:22.14]It's fun.
[299:33.47]What do you mean you can't get over here?
[299:38.36]Why?
[299:38.64]Why the fuck not?
[299:51.46]Superpowered mind.
[299:53.16]Mechanical canine.
[299:58.03]Rescue the day from destruction.
[300:04.80]Why are you writing that?
[300:05.84]It's a cool theme song, though.
[300:09.00]This is the theme song.
[300:13.52]Jammy Neutron.
[300:30.54]Okay, over to the boat show.
[300:36.03]Let's go.
[300:37.41]We are in downtown.
[300:39.10]We gotta go down and we gotta go left, south, and then west.
[300:44.62]Boat show.
[300:45.30]Wait, was the boat show here or was it... It's in Uptown, isn't it?
[301:06.43]What about the library?
[301:07.33]Fucking manslaughter.
[301:13.91]Alright, let's go to the boat.
[301:21.08]Boat.
[301:22.28]Show.
[301:22.84]Boat.
[301:23.74]Show.
[301:24.20]Boat.
[301:24.68]Show.
[301:38.01]Parting.
[301:38.39]You guys are making me upset.
[301:42.06]Willy's boat.
[301:50.10]Okay.
[301:51.40]Boat show.
[301:57.83]Okay, I'm here for the boat show.
[301:59.87]Need a boat.
[302:01.11]Normally you could take your pick.
[302:03.26]We don't have any.
[302:04.10]Sorry.
[302:06.65]What are you guys talking about?
[302:14.56]Did I talk to Grandpa?
[302:25.31]Is Grandpa just in City Hall still?
[302:37.24]Probably.
[302:37.72]Okay.
[302:41.33]City Hall.
[302:43.91]A roll.
[302:46.47]I need you to come get me.
[302:54.83]Apologize to the chat now.
[302:55.91]I don't apologize for literally everything I ever do.
[303:02.41]No, no, no, no.
[303:05.49]City Hall.
[303:08.00]You guys slipping into crack mode, are they?
[303:11.48]Slipping into crack mode.
[303:12.92]Uh-oh.
[303:14.26]Uh-oh.
[303:16.72]Uh-oh.
[303:25.13]It's getting close to midnight eastern.
[303:28.97]Oh, the bank.
[303:29.47]Right.
[303:29.67]I want to make it an account.
[303:37.92]Bank needs all the help it can get right now.
[303:40.56]I'd like to open an account.
[303:41.44]Free open for business.
[303:46.24]I'd like to open an account.
[303:53.15]I can't... Finally got my money out.
[303:58.73]It's an automated telemachine.
[304:00.49]You can't use it.
[304:01.19]You don't have any money in the bank.
[304:09.76]Fine.
[304:14.34]Why are there so many viewers?
[304:16.04]Um... I don't know.
[304:19.19]Ask them.
[304:19.57]I'm not sure what they're doing here.
[304:30.49]I don't know.
[304:30.99]I started streaming a couple weeks ago.
[304:39.51]Alright, I need an appointment.
[304:50.00]Waiting room.
[304:55.76]They're just waiting.
[305:00.43]They're just here waiting.
[305:07.55]So I can't go up here?
[305:12.76]Alright, where's Grandpa?
[305:15.64]Hello there Mega Man, what can I do for you?
[305:17.80]I'd like to make a donation.
[305:20.28]You will?
[305:20.80]Oh, thank you so much.
[305:22.30]I wonder where we would start.
[305:25.52]Um... Make a few condos.
[305:30.79]We need an additional $5,400.
[305:32.09]How much do you want to donate?
[305:48.61]This is tax-deductible.
[305:51.81]Where's Grandpa?
[305:53.53]Fuck, where is he?
[305:55.33]I don't... He's not in here.
[305:56.37]Why do you have a shop-class blade?
[306:02.72]Oh.
[306:03.40]Alright.
[306:03.88]Doesn't that look like a standing saw?
[306:10.42]Is he on the ship?
[306:21.70]Where the fuck is Grandpa?
[306:23.68]You got a Class A license.
[306:25.00]Yes.
[306:25.56]With that, you... I know.
[306:28.13]Where's the... Okay, I can talk to the monkey.
[306:33.27]In the northern forest.
[306:34.29]Yeah, the mayors really trust you.
[306:37.73]Alright, get... Yes.
[306:40.02]Long-winded.
[306:40.62]You could have just said, thanks.
[306:45.82]It's data, not monkey.
[306:47.24]Alright, let me give the helmet to roll.
[306:50.02]Item dev...
[306:56.28]I got a helmet.
[306:59.50]You won't get knocked down by enemy attacks as easily as before, and you'll be able to survive long falls.
[307:06.93]What if somebody throws you off a cliff?
[307:10.55]Nice, I got it.
[307:11.13]Alright, Data.
[307:18.05]I need your help.
[307:20.38]Tell me.
[307:20.68]What should I do?
[307:23.86]What are you going to use the yellow refractors for?
[307:26.93]Let's think of some way to use the yellow refractor.
[307:33.74]What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
[307:54.97]On the boat?
[307:56.69]But I can't get to the boat because the store is empty.
[308:05.92]There it is.
[308:06.34]Helmet is now on.
[308:09.60]Yes!
[308:10.42]Look it, we're really Mega Man now.
[308:19.93]One guy in chat says, talk to the door next to the boat guy.
[308:24.01]Yeah, I did.
[308:24.49]Remember he said, no, no, there's no boats out there.
[308:26.71]I promise.
[308:27.43]Don't go out there.
[308:28.07]I couldn't go out.
[308:34.33]You gotta talk to the door next to the boat guy multiple times.
[308:39.39]Do it twice?
[308:43.79]Alright.
[308:45.01]Okay.
[308:47.75]That sounds like a bait.
[308:48.69]Yeah, it does.
[308:50.07]That does sound like a bait.
[308:54.69]Yeah, that's a bait.
[308:55.29]It has to be.
[309:04.30]Hmm.
[309:12.45]It's not.
[309:14.83]It's not.
[309:16.49]It's not.
[309:16.95]Somebody got a link?
[309:31.27]Do I actually have to do that?
[309:32.57]That sounds like it's absolutely not true.
[309:37.46]Is it actually true?
[309:38.58]Oh my fucking god.
[309:41.98]Didn't I do this like three times?
[310:05.62]I did this already.
[310:06.66]I talked to the door at least twice.
[310:07.96]Alright, what do you guys need to make the boat work?
[310:15.45]Uh, Wiley asked me to fix this boat for him, but it's... Wait.
[310:20.91]Dr. Wiley?
[310:21.66]I can't fix the place...
[310:32.33]The only thing wrong with this boat is the refractor casing and the couplings.
[310:36.97]If I had a big refractor like yours, I could probably fix it.
[310:41.96]Hold on, I gotta call my sister!
[310:51.81]I mean, progress.
[310:52.51]Someone's been taking really good care of this boat.
[310:55.46]Someone's been taking really good care of this boat.
[310:57.34]Let's put a brick of Velveeta cheese in it, Mega Man.
[310:59.58]What do you think?
[311:00.08]No, no, no.
[311:00.90]Roll, roll.
[311:01.24]No, no, no.
[311:02.52]You ruined it.
[311:03.22]Do you really think you should be doing that?
[311:04.80]Would you look at this engine?
[311:06.50]Let's see.
[311:07.52]All we need to do is fix the transformer and the refractor and it'll be as good as new.
[311:12.27]And what do you think you're doing?
[311:14.97]Mega Man, could you hand me a wrench?
[311:20.91]Should I drink a monster?
[311:24.59]No, eat a banana instead.
[311:27.13]Every time you want to drink a monster, just eat a banana.
[311:32.78]There we go.
[311:33.48]All fixed.
[311:34.60]Whoops.
[311:36.02]I'm sorry.
[311:36.78]I don't know what came over me.
[311:39.54]I just started fixing the ship and... You really love machines, don't you?
[311:44.91]I can tell just by looking at your face.
[311:48.91]Is he talking?
[311:50.33]Is it an eye patch or does it just have no eyes in the eye socket?
[311:55.15]Right now?
[312:21.74]I want to go now.
[312:23.82]You know that to get into the boat, you have to use the door in the back, right?
[312:32.60]Wink.
[312:49.25]Guys, I've only been playing the game for 3 hours and 40 minutes, but I've been streaming for 5 hours and 13 minutes.
[312:53.73]Math doesn't add up.
[312:58.46]It's the boat.
[312:59.64]Call roll.
[313:01.92]Two wings.
[313:08.52]Mega Man, are you ready?
[313:10.43]Yup, let's go.
[313:11.51]Here we go.
[313:17.48]He lost an hour of progress.
[313:19.02]Oh, that's right.
[313:21.38]Another one?
[313:21.88]No, there's not.
[313:24.72]One, two, three.
[313:26.12]I'm picking something up on the sonar.
[313:28.90]Keep an eye out, Mega Man.
[313:30.70]Got it.
[313:30.94]Okay.
[313:31.82]I knew it.
[313:32.94]They're here.
[313:33.80]Is she driving?
[313:34.52]Their robots are here.
[313:38.98]Water battle.
[313:39.54]Protect your boat from the enemy's attack.
[313:41.06]Shoot and destroy the red sub's torpedoes and the yellow ship's missiles before they hit the ship.
[313:46.68]mission start let's go I can say things loud too roll can I get off really could use range for this I don't have any range
[314:17.45]It's a wink storm?
[314:18.59]What is all this shit?
[314:32.58]I can't hit anything from here.
[314:35.12]One, two, three, three more?
[314:54.22]Who's left?
[314:58.84]That's bad.
[314:59.50]Must be getting a slight electric shock free time.
[315:30.72]Ah, no rain!
[315:36.31]Ohhhhh, fire!
[315:40.25]I'm having buyer's remorse.
[315:56.40]No refund.
[315:59.92]I see it!
[316:08.02]It's over there!
[316:20.31]Mega Man ahead, I don't see where.
[316:24.73]Bart redeemed, Bart points, Bart redeemed.
[316:27.03]Oh my god, you guys.
[316:30.42]Mega Man, behind us!
[317:06.00]Somebody wrote Omega.
[317:09.08]Omega, I was here.
[317:10.42]What are you talking about, man?
[317:18.18]I was here.
[317:21.44]Imagine I was hearing over a fucking fart sound.
[317:28.14]Oh, we need another refractor.
[317:29.82]This thing's going down.
[317:42.75]What's this sound?
[317:49.72]Get it.
[317:51.76]Slam your desk.
[317:53.24]Slam your desk.
[318:00.63]Why am I gonna slam my desk?
[318:04.69]It looks like we got rid of all their little ships.
[318:08.28]Wait!
[318:08.92]I can see it on the sonar!
[318:11.24]Heads up, Mega Man!
[318:13.68]Something big's coming this way!
[318:16.66]You guys are fucking crazy.
[318:22.27]I knew our little blue boy'd show up.
[318:25.21]I figured we'd run into him sooner or later if we waited here.
[318:28.23]Slow ahead!
[318:29.15]Slow
[318:34.66]Crazy into, crazy in, crazy into you.
[318:38.55]Slow ahead, slow ahead, slow ahead.
[318:40.49]What are you doing, Otto?
[318:46.10]Well, that's a big one.
[318:47.09]That's a big thing.
[318:48.27]Alright, men!
[318:52.31]Concentrate your fire on the blue boy.
[318:54.29]Blow him and his little toy boat out of the water.
[318:57.53]What?
[318:58.47]But, Diesel!
[319:00.19]If we sink his boat... Holy shit, wait, he fought it on camera?
[319:03.48]If we can get him to smash his desk now, if we just say it with all capital.
[319:06.60]We can get whatever we want from the man, right?
[319:11.17]It's a meme, huh?
[319:12.18]Dies?
[319:39.34]Wait, they want to kill me.
[319:45.24]Train.
[319:45.86]Look at the boat's damage too.
[319:48.46]I think I have to hit it in the eyes.
[319:55.71]So, pull over.
[319:56.85]Pull over then.
[320:00.45]Roll.
[320:00.67]Just pull over to the island.
[320:01.55]I'll climb on it.
[320:05.42]Roll.
[320:07.82]Roll.
[320:08.44]Pull over.
[320:08.92]We should pull over.
[320:10.68]Pull over!
[320:11.02]Retreat.
[320:11.26]Thank you.
[320:11.80]How do you get range?
[320:12.70]I don't have any range.
[320:13.48]I can't even hit him.
[320:37.01]Troll, slow down!
[320:37.91]That was full speed.
[320:41.03]Alright, I need... I gotta take Otto outside.
[320:44.04]Wanna go outside?
[320:46.20]You wanna go?
[320:47.16]Yeah?
[320:48.30]Yeah, he needs to go out.
[320:49.24]I'm gonna feed him too.
[320:50.66]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[320:53.56]I'm right back.
[320:57.25]Show Otto.
[320:57.95]No, no, no, no.
[320:58.63]He wants to go.
[320:59.97]He needs to go out.
[321:01.13]He's gotta pee.
[321:02.19]Imagine you had to pee and somebody picked you up and was like, look over here.
[321:04.87]Don't pee yet.
[321:08.60]Have a great day.
[328:25.25]Otto did not just have to pee.
[328:29.61]He did the other thing.
[328:33.61]He went to go find a perfect little spot.
[328:37.13]He's now good to go.
[328:46.02]Thanks, I'm eating.
[328:46.82]I didn't say anything.
[328:48.00]I said he's doing the other thing.
[328:50.36]I don't know, he could be walking around.
[328:55.91]Alright.
[328:56.97]Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[328:59.51]We need range.
[329:04.07]Two range.
[329:04.91]+2 range.
[329:08.11]I mean, this is... This much range?
[329:11.97]Is that too much?
[329:13.47]I should have put the laser back on.
[329:19.35]You think that's enough range?
[329:30.36]Probably.
[329:30.84]Okay, what about special weapon?
[329:39.06]No, that's fine.
[329:40.18]I don't think it's enough.
[329:43.42]It's probably enough.
[329:48.90]Remember, this is a child's game.
[329:53.86]Just do what looks cool.
[329:58.53]This is, this is Mega Man!
[330:00.69]Oh shit, we're just going right into it.
[330:02.01]Okay.
[330:06.19]I can reach.
[330:09.57]With the eye?
[330:11.90]Am I not reaching?
[330:15.12]Wait, am I even hitting the base?
[330:18.44]I kind of... It's definitely right in the eye.
[330:30.56]No?
[330:33.60]Huh.
[330:37.90]Where are we going?
[330:42.80]Where the hell are we?
[330:45.80]Oh.
[330:50.06]Um.
[330:50.34]What the fuck?
[330:54.06]Now can I hit it?
[331:03.05]If you don't watch it, you're going to end up with a big hole in your backside!
[331:13.64]Megaman.
[331:15.04]What?
[331:15.34]Megaman, are you alright?
[331:19.65]Yeah.
[331:20.77]You didn't fall off or anything, did you?
[331:22.85]No, I'm alright.
[331:24.33]What's in the back there?
[331:26.47]Ah, something in the back.
[331:27.69]I shouldn't be able to maneuver in here.
[331:45.45]Got it.
[331:47.53]Alright, there goes the arm.
[331:51.07]Alright, those are hard to hit.
[332:00.47]Arm.
[332:01.63]Walk onto the arm.
[332:02.27]Come on, hit it in the arm.
[332:05.78]He's waving his arms around too much.
[332:17.26]Die!
[332:18.15]Is he back?
[332:18.77]Yeah, just refresh the page man.
[332:42.69]In the eye.
[332:43.21]In the back.
[332:44.85]Can we dodge that?
[332:47.50]Is this a DPS race, that's all?
[332:51.22]DPS race.
[333:09.19]Just barely out of range.
[333:10.34]There it is.
[333:12.02]I'm not losing the race.
[333:14.41]I'm fine.
[333:20.02]Who's talking?
[333:21.66]Did I take out the entire Tron Bone family here?
[333:55.38]I guess.
[333:59.72]I hate to admit it, but I can't admit it.
[334:15.54]Who talks first here?
[334:16.74]What?
[334:16.84]Who are your parents?
[334:45.06]Like a 60 age gap here.
[334:51.80]Fonda's 14.
[334:53.30]Well, that dude's like 45 or 50.
[334:56.03]He's supposed to be 29?
[334:57.61]He's 29?! !
[335:18.42]Alright, well, I made it to the island.
[335:27.99]It looks like you.
[335:28.65]Oh, I'm... older, so... Here comes the rain train.
[335:38.62]Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[335:45.73]This dude's ancient.
[335:48.05]Tell me.
[335:51.09]Do we need just two keys?
[336:14.32]I gotta get this image thing set up.
[336:20.00]That's a good one.
[336:22.16]That's a good one.
[336:22.60]Hold on.
[336:22.92]That's a good one.
[336:28.52]So in the very near future, there's going to be a place to put image links.
[336:33.52]So I can easily have them captured already and be able to cut to them immediately.
[336:39.81]So they don't have to be in the chat.
[336:42.91]It's gonna be... it's gonna be pretty good.
[336:45.33]That's the plan.
[336:46.43]Not there yet, but we'll see.
[336:48.18]You'll see soon.
[336:51.52]Alright, let's put it on the screen.
[336:52.64]It's actually pretty funny.
[337:04.45]It could be my hair on a given day.
[337:06.23]It could be.
[337:10.14]Not a good time for a call.
[337:12.88]Uh, sure.
[337:14.34]Thank you.
[337:14.78]Yes.
[337:14.98]Alright, talk to you soon.
[337:36.06]Hey, new spotter, bro?
[337:38.80]Nope, I'm okay.
[337:39.62]Is this a hole?
[337:40.58]That is a hole.
[337:46.41]I have the laser on?
[337:47.57]Yeah, I got... I have it on.
[337:48.73]I have laser in range.
[337:50.83]I'm actually kind of liking it.
[337:56.49]Thanks for showing my hard work as soon as my birthday started.
[337:59.11]You're very welcome.
[338:02.96]You're very welcome.
[338:15.46]Range will save your ass, yeah.
[338:18.22]It's just so much better.
[338:19.00]I like energy too, though, just because I like getting more out.
[338:24.37]Because I feel like it's kind of hard sometimes with some of the enemies to get more than two or three shots off before having to move.
[338:35.54]Oh, happy birthday.
[338:36.22]Yeah, I didn't... Why did I not say happy birthday?
[338:37.96]What, am I crazy?
[338:38.62]Okay.
[338:48.10]High energy and rapid is fun.
[338:51.32]Yeah, we'll see what I end up with.
[338:57.79]Old hover jets.
[339:00.77]I have a board, and I have jets.
[339:03.71]You know what that means.
[339:04.91]Hover board incoming.
[339:15.01]Go up.
[339:15.43]Where else can I go?
[339:16.43]Just up.
[339:17.53]Yeah, just up.
[339:18.25]Where are we going?
[339:20.97]We don't need roads.
[339:22.65]I hate these guys.
[339:27.21]I actually don't really like this cannon thing that much.
[339:29.51]I don't.
[339:31.40]I think I want to change it.
[339:33.20]It's a little too slow.
[339:35.48]It's alright.
[339:53.63]Put the power plus mode back on.
[339:55.25]I like the range.
[340:00.09]Vacuum.
[340:02.37]Maybe we'll just... Does it cost energy to use it?
[340:13.20]No, it doesn't.
[340:13.78]Alright, maybe I'll try it.
[340:22.49]And upgraded pretty cheap, too.
[340:23.87]Alright.
[340:26.35]Remind me to look at the vacuum when I get out of the game.
[340:30.32]Or when I get into the boat.
[340:31.84]The car, whatever the thing is.
[340:32.86]Any holes?
[340:39.42]You were... That was deceiving.
[340:40.30]You were in a different spot than I thought you were.
[340:41.58]Wrap around...
[340:53.35]Okay.
[340:53.67]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[341:08.26]First co-op juke.
[341:10.68]No, that's not a co-op juke.
[341:11.72]What are you talking about?
[341:12.60]It's not even... It's on different lines.
[341:14.58]That's not even... That's not... Come on.
[341:17.54]You're telling me there's a co-op juke in chat and I don't see it?
[341:25.42]Dog.
[341:28.02]What?
[341:28.58]I can see water.
[341:29.60]Okay.
[341:29.96]Big jump.
[341:30.30]Nope.
[341:58.90]There's a lot to explore in here.
[342:00.10]Alright, let's take it easy.
[342:03.50]I want to go over here.
[342:06.36]No, not yet.
[342:07.18]There's probably a chest or something.
[342:14.35]There it is.
[342:15.49]There is a chest.
[342:18.77]Sounds like DBZ.
[342:20.55]Kind of.
[342:29.14]Yeah.
[342:30.08]They're like... Joint Plung.
[342:33.87]Could use one of those.
[342:49.13]And they come... Well, they can come out, they can come out, they can come out.
[342:51.29]These are just like the things from... You know the game that I was just playing yesterday?
[342:59.84]Rain World.
[343:02.72]Holy fuck, there's more of them!
[343:08.30]I'm just trying to get some money.
[343:24.80]I have a full canister, right?
[343:25.88]I should.
[343:27.56]Oh, fucking my god.
[343:30.90]I gotta run.
[343:32.20]There's too many.
[343:33.24]What is that?
[343:51.09]This looks like it's gonna move.
[344:03.76]No.
[344:06.28]I'm okay.
[344:09.26]Look for holes.
[344:11.64]I don't see any.
[344:14.96]Hole?
[344:19.83]Eat desk.
[344:20.15]I'll try.
[344:20.59]Do I bite down?
[344:22.79]Is it soft?
[344:33.95]No.
[344:34.73]Ow.
[344:37.47]That hurt my teeth.
[344:43.69]What did Roll just say?
[344:50.88]Ooh.
[344:52.00]If I'm reading this right, there's a huge refractor there.
[344:55.36]There is.
[344:56.32]We should be able to repair the flutter with one that big.
[344:59.25]The flutter?
[345:01.89]It's shielded, isn't it?
[345:04.15]Gotta get more keys.
[345:06.23]God damn it.
[345:07.23]Not this.
[345:14.87]Don't give up.
[345:15.59]Eat the whole thing.
[345:17.05]That hurts you.
[345:18.31]Unbelievable.
[345:18.91]Alright, I need keys.
[345:28.09]Wait, is there a way to jump anywhere?
[345:31.70]No, it's just this one room.
[345:39.42]I didn't cook the desk.
[345:43.42]No, I didn't.
[345:44.05]You're right.
[345:45.31]I did not cook the desk.
[345:53.82]Back into the alligator room.
[345:57.58]Alright, I'm just going to try to range it.
[346:07.32]Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.
[346:19.78]How did I miss?
[346:40.05]We're good.
[346:42.43]Disaster averted.
[346:44.97]Where?
[346:46.35]Where is he?
[346:57.28]Still two or three more in here.
[346:59.52]Then I can look around for a second.
[347:00.58]Alright, I can go down here.
[347:01.34]Which way?
[347:03.94]I'll go this way.
[347:10.66]The full cutscene to go through the door.
[347:12.22]Alright, how many keys do I need?
[347:15.40]Three?
[347:15.66]I used my canister already, too.
[347:22.58]This is bad.
[347:26.57]Very bad.
[347:27.07]What's a himbo?
[347:37.23]I don't know.
[347:39.83]They call me that all the time.
[347:40.97]I don't know what it means.
[347:43.71]Rapid Striker!
[347:50.03]Wait.
[347:54.71]Sword and Striker?
[347:55.41]That'd be pretty neat.
[348:03.56]It means you're sexy and stupid.
[348:19.46]Megalol, I was here.
[348:21.34]That's my favorite comment of the whole night.
[348:27.87]I was here.
[348:39.78]Still can't get in here.
[348:46.20]So, at least I explored it.
[348:47.72]Wait, no.
[348:55.67]So, I'm gonna go back.
[348:59.15]This alligator room is gonna absolutely destroy me later, I know it is.
[349:02.19]I know it is.
[349:04.19]Alright, uh, bang a right.
[349:19.09]Okay, not going this way.
[349:26.05]Looking for keys, keys, keys.
[349:29.47]Anybody see any keys?
[349:38.16]Is there another jump that's higher than this?
[349:43.04]I'm going here.
[349:47.86]I got the one in the middle.
[349:48.88]I got that already.
[349:50.60]I think I did.
[349:52.97]Silverflame, go do your fucking homework, please.
[349:57.07]Hey, Zebralord, thanks for the five community subs, Zebralord.
[350:02.92]Thanks for those five subs.
[350:05.16]Thanks for giving the five subs to this community.

[350:13.23]Whoa.
[350:23.79]Loomed right out of here.

[351:17.64]Pick a starter?
[351:19.22]Alright, I'll pick a starter.
[351:20.59]Sure.
[351:21.95]I'm kind of a... I would say more of a water type.
[351:28.37]So I usually pick the water type in the Pokémon games I've never played.
[351:32.44]I played Pokémon Diamond for about two hours before I stopped playing and I never played it ever again.
[351:38.98]But that's what I did.
[351:48.34]It's the best one, I've heard.
[351:49.76]That's what I've heard.
[351:54.32]No, I've been, wasn't Pokémon Green Tea, whatever, better?
[351:57.43]What's the one, the Green Leaf?
[352:02.59]Leaf Green?
[352:05.43]Heard that's also the best one, or one of the better ones.
[352:28.33]Somebody just woke up.
[352:29.71]Oh, Jesus.
[352:30.21]Wait, Mega Man's still?
[352:31.13]Fuck.
[352:32.05]What was that?
[352:32.57]Anything in it?
[352:44.88]A ring.
[352:46.56]And it's... Oh, it's... It's just a green fucking cell.
[352:52.06]I don't even want to identify it.
[353:02.92]Alright, now over to the right side?
[353:06.64]Yeah, I haven't gone over there.
[353:07.42]Can I get up there?
[353:09.84]I don't think I can get up this.
[353:13.87]Nope, I can't get up there.
[353:20.75]Sour Tower, the last emote that's been added to Jerma985's twitch.tv channel.
[353:37.54]Really?
[353:39.86]No, not yet, not yet.
[353:40.82]I want to see if I can go anywhere else.
[353:44.30]The one spot that I... What about over there?
[353:47.17]Can I get there from... I think I can jump from here, and then jump over.
[353:55.37]Ugh!
[353:55.55]Nope.
[353:57.13]Shit, how am I supposed to get up there?
[353:59.36]Skirmire, are you bilingual?
[354:02.96]No.
[354:03.80]No, not at all.
[354:08.42]Oh, there's a little hallway.
[354:10.73]There we go.
[354:17.87]And there's a hole in here, too.
[354:20.43]Another starter key.
[354:28.68]And some money?
[354:29.38]Nice.
[354:33.22]No, I cannot speak another language.
[354:35.32]As much as I'd love to.
[354:36.13]I just... It's not going to happen.
[354:39.41]Alright, there's one more key I've got to get.
[354:46.45]So if I go from here over to here... And I jump from... Hold on.
[354:58.88]jump from here to there no I definitely can't that means I must be able to wrap around here they're waiting to go to the left I can teach you Spanish I can't learn it trust me experts have tried and experts have failed
[355:31.46]I'm going to go back.
[355:32.10]I don't want to lose all this progress.
[355:39.90]Refill everything.
[355:40.66]Deposit the items.
[355:45.14]Yeah, I'm referring to... I'm referring to my 8th grade Spanish teacher.
[355:50.79]Expert.
[355:51.17]You have to be an expert to be able to teach like a class.
[355:58.65]Let me get out of here and go deposit.
[356:08.58]It's never too late to try again.
[356:09.70]It is for me.
[356:13.21]Because I just... I don't want the time.
[356:15.81]You want to go back to town?
[356:17.91]No, no.
[356:18.73]I just want to have you make stuff.
[356:26.25]Yeah, let's go back to whatever.
[356:27.21]I'd like to talk to you.
[356:32.87]Alright, roll.
[356:34.23]I want to...
[356:36.59]I don't know.
[356:37.01]Fake winks?
[356:37.41]I know.
[356:37.59]Alright, roll.
[356:38.13]I need you.
[356:38.77]I need the car.
[356:39.67]Deposit items.
[356:40.91]No, it was real.
[357:05.84]Shave head, you legend.
[357:13.18]What?
[357:14.14]You legend.
[357:18.50]Alright, item development.
[357:20.71]Make something.
[357:25.13]Rollerboard and hoverboard jets were used to make jet skates.
[357:31.18]Jetskates, with these, you'll be able to move a lot faster than you can by running.
[357:35.56]Just be careful you don't get hit by cars if you use them in the city.
[357:39.74]Alright, activate, hold down the circle button.
[357:44.71]The jetskates will turn off if you release the circle button.
[357:47.75]Or when you take damage from an enemy attack.
[357:51.05]You can slide while using the skates too.
[357:54.69]Use the directional button.
[357:57.02]Alright, cool.
[357:58.20]The joint plug was used to make adapter plug.
[358:02.64]Match to your Mega Man Buster.
[358:04.46]Until now, you've only been able to use two parts.
[358:07.36]Simultaneously, right?
[358:08.80]Well, with this, you'll be able to use three.
[358:12.01]Different parts at the same time.
[358:13.63]Fuck yeah.
[358:13.97]What do you think about that?
[358:16.15]I think it's pretty great, actually.
[358:17.35]Alright, let me take, uh... Change weapon.
[358:27.84]Grenade arm... It's a vacuum.
[358:32.30]Flashbime.
[358:34.08]Normal arm.
[358:35.76]Powered buster.
[358:37.58]Yeah, where's the vacuum?
[358:39.26]Grenade arm.
[358:42.90]What?
[358:43.16]Where is it?
[358:45.64]Normal arm?
[358:46.30]Did I miss it or something?
[358:51.99]Is it not on here?
[358:58.89]I'm looking for the vacuum.
[359:00.21]When I... Oh, I didn't get the last part because of the reset.
[359:07.79]Ah, the outright.
[359:08.75]Okay.
[359:09.07]Alright, let me go, um... Let me put these on.
[359:18.94]I have, and I got really angry at it.
[359:21.52]Because I...
[359:25.75]I used to play it when I was younger, and I got really pissed off at it.
[359:30.58]It was hard.
[359:31.30]How the fuck do you get mad at Jet Set Radio?
[359:45.27]Because it's a very precise game.
[359:49.33]The jumping and the landing and grinding, I got upset by it.
[359:54.27]Alright, sniper unit, laser.
[359:55.69]Should we do just mega power?
[360:01.47]Or do I do rapid fire?
[360:06.42]Machine gun?
[360:09.62]I think machine gun would be pretty good.
[360:11.04]Or just hyper power.
[360:12.24]I'm going to do machine gun.
[360:24.66]Look at that.
[360:24.92]This looks pretty good.
[360:29.64]And I'll keep... Yeah, sniper... Yeah, this is good.
[360:33.30]Special items.
[360:36.12]Jet skates.
[360:37.46]Okay, cool.
[360:38.22]And then adapter plug.
[360:40.64]They're already on.
[360:41.22]Alright, I need one more of these keys.
[360:47.71]Special weapons?
[360:48.77]No, no, no.
[360:49.51]Yeah, I have to go get it.
[360:52.23]But, nah.
[360:54.03]I want to go back.
[360:54.61]No, it's in a trash can, right?
[360:58.13]Let's go get it.
[361:06.78]This is awesome.
[361:11.94]Actual travel.
[361:21.98]Broken propeller, there it is.
[361:29.92]Is that another full star?
[361:32.96]No, no, no, this is not a car.
[361:34.24]I mean, am I tech- wait.
[361:38.85]Does this get plus one letter grade on technicality?
[361:41.53]Because, is Mega Man a car?
[361:46.61]Could be.
[361:47.61]Is he in a car?
[361:54.45]Wait, I want to go talk to Roll.
[361:57.87]Sure.
[362:00.92]Car-like mechanism.
[362:04.02]He doesn't have wheels.
[362:04.88]Does he have an engine?
[362:05.58]Does Mega Man have an engine in his suit?
[362:07.46]Am I missing something else?
[362:19.15]What am I missing?
[362:26.74]Motor?
[362:32.81]Is it just in random trash cans?
[362:41.65]I already went in these ones, right?
[362:44.79]He's a robot.
[362:49.62]Yeah.
[362:50.14]Crash.
[362:55.16]Crash.
[362:59.58]I kind of sound like a vacuum.
[363:08.30]It's in a very specific trash can.
[363:13.56]Which, uh, which can is it in?
[363:21.35]Somewhere here?
[363:23.83]The fuck is hitting me?
[363:27.56]Okay, I just got double hit by a car.
[363:29.44]That's great.
[363:29.86]Alright, and it- was it in here?
[363:46.92]No.
[363:54.01]Garbage pail.
[363:54.91]Is there anything in it?
[363:56.49]Found the bloom bear parts.
[364:02.43]What's that?
[364:03.03]Is this garbage over here?
[364:17.90]Does anyone know where the specific garbage is?
[364:19.91]Gotta get the screwdriver.
[364:23.01]No, I had it made before.
[364:26.16]I had it made before.
[364:26.90]It was found in a trash can.
[364:34.30]The boy's like the list.
[364:37.10]Okay.

[365:20.49]Next to these buildings, this town looks like ass.
[365:22.35]Let me get a drink.
[365:33.84]I do appreciate the fact that there's three chugs.
[365:37.61]A lot of video games, for some reason, they do a single.
[365:41.19]And it's not accurate.
[365:44.19]I appreciate that.
[366:06.44]development it's been five minutes without a joke streaming career over machine buster unfortunately it's not that great in terms of power so you might have to put some thought into how you use it vacuum arm special weapon yep
[366:36.46]Career is going to be over.
[366:37.66]Okay, let's see it.
[366:42.24]Change weapon.

[366:56.02]No, I want to do the vacuum arm.
[366:59.00]Increase weapon use time.
[367:01.82]Holy shit.
[367:04.54]This is maxed out.
[367:07.38]What about the range?
[367:07.98]500?
[367:08.40]That's cheap.
[367:10.38]More?
[367:10.62]That's pretty cheap.
[367:13.10]One more.
[367:17.23]Range is maxed out.
[367:18.01]Increases suction speed.
[367:24.97]Most expensive part.
[367:25.89]More suction speed.
[367:28.87]Level 3.
[367:29.65]The highest amount of suction you could possibly have.
[367:35.48]Maxed out.

[367:37.24]Maxed out.
[367:38.50]Good.

[367:43.28]I don't like the mod.
[367:44.80]Normal arm.

[368:19.02]That's an original username there.
[368:21.44]That's just, that's just Jerma lied.
[368:23.14]There are people that would probably pay you for that username.
[368:30.30]That's probably, you know like how some websites, people just like squat on them?
[368:47.40]Alright, let's check it out.
[368:48.40]It's on, right?
[368:49.21]It's equipped?
[368:49.61]Let me just make sure my... 0 out of 10.
[368:57.39]How do I... I gotta fill this in the town?
[368:59.75]No, fuck it.
[369:00.32]I don't even need it.
[369:01.08]Fuck it.
[369:17.58]Jerma's tallest fan is the best name.
[369:19.78]No, it isn't.
[369:22.22]No, not even close.
[369:24.24]Not even close.
[369:38.37]He hates his fan.
[369:43.47]He's jealous.
[369:45.57]Alright, can I... What's with these stupid doors?
[369:48.63]These doors are annoying.
[369:51.85]No, honestly, one of my... Okay, okay.
[370:00.02]You wanna know one of my favorite usernames?
[370:03.04]Sorry, it's the name... JermaLiedAboutGway is one of my favorite usernames.
[370:07.78]It's because it's so... It's so...
[370:12.52]Specific and never used and that use case is just at as close to zero as you can get I have two starter keys need one more Let's start skiing
[370:40.07]How much energy?
[370:40.55]Does this use infinite energy?
[370:45.93]Yeah, I saved you.
[370:46.81]Should be.
[370:49.13]Why is it using the bat?
[370:49.79]I'm just testing it.
[370:59.97]Well, it's pretty good.
[371:01.51]Pretty useful.
[371:05.65]Look at how much more damage I'm doing to it.
[371:06.92]This is great.
[371:11.16]Such a huge range, too.
[371:23.45]It's the speedrun gun.
[371:24.65]Is it, actually?
[371:31.20]I feel like that's not lies.
[371:32.34]I feel like that could be pretty accurate.
[371:40.42]Just a hole?
[371:40.94]I got that hole before.
[371:52.71]Pretty satisfying to use, too.
[372:00.19]Alright, where are we going?
[372:01.15]I need one more key.
[372:08.53]Wait, two holes?
[372:09.21]What are we talking about?
[372:19.44]Isn't it your bedtime yet?
[372:20.68]No, not yet.
[372:25.82]How do you sleep when you're sick?
[372:28.05]It depends on how you're stuffed up.
[372:31.89]I always like to put a couple of pillows underneath my head and shoulders.
[372:36.67]Because then when you lie back, if you have a stuffy nose and a sore throat, it starts closing you up.
[372:47.46]So, lying down and having your head propped up a little bit helped.
[372:51.48]Somebody said humidifier.
[372:52.44]The next thing I was going to say was humidifier, potentially.
[373:03.32]And don't abuse it, because it's really not great for you.
[373:08.29]But if it's really, you know, to open you up a little bit and make you go to sleep, stuff like NyQuil in very, very small moderation is good, I think.
[373:20.72]Make sure you're getting plenty of water.
[373:33.99]One of the things about NyQuil is NyQuil has acetaminophen in it.
[373:38.54]And it's like a full dose of acetaminophen.
[373:40.22]And people just go, I'm just gonna drink some more NyQuil.
[373:42.34]I have like double, triple the dose.
[373:44.04]You're taking like two to three times a dose of acetaminophen that you should be taking.
[373:48.33]And it's really not good for you at all.
[373:49.45]It's actually very bad for you.
[373:50.39]So you shouldn't be doing that.
[374:04.52]It's really, really bad for your liver.
[374:05.78]It can make you pretty... It can actually make you sick.
[374:08.11]Really sick.
[374:10.05]You take too much acetaminophen in one day, more than the recommended amount, it actually... You can get actually very sick.
[374:17.27]Alright, let's go... Where am I going to go?
[374:28.24]Farming right now.
[374:33.14]Same with caffeine.
[374:40.05]We don't talk about caffeine or anything.
[374:42.09]We don't talk about caffeine.
[374:50.52]If you drink one coffee a day, one coffee in the morning, you'll be fine.
[375:04.46]There's one way to get to this spot that I can't get to.
[375:09.04]Where is it?
[375:11.93]I gotta go that way.
[375:14.55]How do I get up there?
[375:18.79]From there, maybe?
[375:39.23]Come on, go crazy.
[375:47.23]Go crazy.
[375:47.97]Can I get there from here?
[375:54.03]How do I get up there?
[376:12.42]Where did you come from?
[376:13.34]Hi, new viewer here.
[376:19.22]Do you hate me?
[376:19.94]Uh, well... Exit this door.
[376:33.45]What?
[376:34.01]He hates all new fans until they prove that he should like them.
[376:39.95]Who said that?
[376:50.78]Okay.
[376:51.46]Now.
[376:52.95]Bingo.
[376:55.99]Start a key.
[376:58.14]Yeah.
[377:00.58]That's three keys.
[377:01.50]That's not it?
[377:10.09]Jerma says that true fans are made after a few weeks of watching the stream and contributing to the chat.
[377:21.86]He hates new fans because... Hold on, what the fuck are you talking about?
[377:24.46]He hates new fans because they haven't paid him yet.
[377:28.38]And he deems all non-paid fans as unnecessary and not even needed.
[377:32.39]What the fuck are you talking about?
[377:38.39]This is fucking kind of annoying.
[377:39.85]I'm kidding.
[378:06.93]I didn't say that!
[378:07.85]I'm fucking responding to it!
[378:09.87]Alright, where's the reactor?
[378:26.79]Is it through here?
[378:31.68]JZZB, thanks for the five community subs!
[378:36.55]Hey, thanks!
[378:38.37]Thanks for showing some of those, thanks for giving us some real fans!
[378:51.72]Do you think people actually really think like that?
[378:57.21]They probably do, right?
[378:58.49]No?
[378:59.53]Probably not as much as, do people really think like that?
[379:08.41]100 fucking percent.
[379:12.58]That's so bad.
[379:19.58]Snarbosis, 10 community subs, thank you.
[379:24.19]Thanks for the 10.
[379:27.99]I've done this three times now.
[379:30.37]When do we put it all together?
[379:33.91]People get greedy.
[379:40.73]Thank you for the money.
[379:42.15]Thank you for the money.
[379:43.05]It was a joke, Jerma.
[379:45.47]Jerma lied.
[379:47.73]What a great username.
[379:54.56]The thing behind me is gonna be boss.
[379:57.36]And I have a vacuum cleaner for a weapon.
[379:59.52]This is good.
[380:11.17]Mega Man, I'm picking up a Reverbot signal.
[380:14.05]It came out of nowhere.
[380:15.57]It's a big one.
[380:16.95]The readings are going off the scale.
[380:19.25]The vacuum is perfect for getting money.
[380:26.31]Oh dear.
[380:29.03]Alright, what's his move set?
[380:29.93]Study the move set for a little bit.
[380:30.89]Study the move set.
[380:36.92]Got him right in his little head.
[380:43.14]Gotta be right in the head, right?
[380:46.04]Yep.
[380:46.60]Okay.
[380:47.84]Where is he?
[380:52.59]Wait for him to dodge?
[380:54.63]Okay, that fucking really hurt.
[380:57.27]Oh my god.
[380:58.89]Oh my god.
[380:59.97]Can I run?
[381:00.45]Can I leave?
[381:00.87]He has this, like, shockwave?
[381:06.26]Dude, I can't even get him to stay in frame.
[381:10.80]Holy shit, this is horrible.
[381:13.87]I can't even... Dude, the camera is just fucking... I'm gonna run.
[381:28.59]Canteen's empty.
[381:29.23]I'm dead.
[381:46.55]Dude.
[381:49.47]This is so bad.
[382:00.76]How the fuck are you supposed to fight this guy?
[382:08.84]Jump and shoot?
[382:09.58]No, I can't.
[382:10.16]I can't do that.
[382:10.70]I can't.
[382:15.66]Did I save outside here?
[382:17.04]Use the lock on?
[382:23.70]It doesn't do the thing.
[382:25.68]It doesn't turn around.
[382:27.24]They have to be in frame.
[382:30.18]If you lock on, you can't move.
[382:38.59]Oh, wait.
[382:52.65]Down and circle is a quick turn?
[382:55.55]I wish I knew that.
[383:01.05]Wish I knew that.
[383:01.63]Why did I not know that?
[383:03.97]Give me the damn canteen, too.
[383:05.13]I'm fucking going here.
[383:06.25]Prepared.
[383:17.81]Why do I have to fill the canteen at the fucking store?
[383:20.91]I can't just go fill it up at like a water fountain or something.
[383:23.09]Why do I have to go all the way back to the store to do this?
[383:39.44]Mega Man Legends is like six hours?
[383:41.52]Well, we found out today that that was not accurate.
[383:49.16]Found out that was not accurate.
[384:05.95]We go to the only place that sells water.
[384:08.53]The trash store.
[384:09.57]Should I get this?
[384:40.46]I could have that.
[384:41.26]I could have tons of attack.
[384:45.09]I got the laser, yeah, but I could do that too.
[384:52.91]Super range?
[384:56.84]No, no, we'll just keep it the way it is.
[384:58.60]Alright, what can I sell?
[385:10.56]Hypercar.
[385:11.10]Recharge your special weapon.
[385:12.34]How do I use this?
[385:13.00]Is this a regular item?
[385:28.03]Damn, okay.
[385:33.49]I'm sorry, but Vinny's about to start his Sunday stream.
[385:35.59]Good luck.
[385:35.85]No, don't leave!
[385:36.97]Don't leave!
[385:37.33]Please stay here!
[385:39.55]Please, I'll do anything.
[385:40.25]I'll do anything.
[385:40.75]You want to wink?
[385:42.91]Hey.
[385:46.60]Did you say stay in?
[385:54.82]Wait, where is this?
[386:00.88]Where am I?
[386:07.79]This is pathetic.
[386:08.85]Goodbye.
[386:10.94]Why is it like dogs chase?
[386:12.08]Why is it like, why are there rapid dogs?
[386:15.00]Are they rapid?
[386:15.66]Why are there so many of them?
[386:19.44]Oh shit, he just ran into me.
[386:21.52]I didn't mean to do that.
[386:23.12]Oh shit.

[386:32.89]Get me out, get me out, get me out.
[386:37.66]Where did I get in here?
[386:42.12]Where did I come in from?
[386:43.76]Over here.
[386:45.00]Why are there these mean dogs everywhere?
[386:52.99]What the fuck?
[386:53.81]Where am I?
[386:54.49]No, I want to go back to the... You're in Old Town.

[388:30.96]They call this part of the city the Old City.
[388:33.98]Long time ago people used to live here.
[388:36.40]But the only things living here now are the dogs.
[388:39.76]Well, if you came here to see the main gate, then you should go to the south gate.
[388:45.02]If you want to go to the power plant, it's to the north.
[388:52.72]Thanks.
[389:12.51]I'm not gonna kick the dog.
[389:13.15]I'm not gonna kick the dog.
[389:13.93]Alright, let's go back in there.

[391:49.74]Um, I actually don't have Mario Sunshine.
[391:52.86]I will.
[391:54.54]I will.
[391:57.63]Not right this second.
[392:06.20]I'm getting it.
[392:16.73]I'll have it by the end of the week.
[392:27.51]Alright, I know where I need to go.
[392:28.91]So let's skip.
[392:31.83]Skip.
[392:43.18]Practice the quick turn.
[392:44.16]Sure.
[392:44.38]Boom.
[392:45.28]Boom.
[392:45.92]Got it.
[392:48.86]Don't worry, I'm going to play Mario Sunshine.
[393:00.82]I would hate being a Twitch video game streamer.
[393:02.46]It seems like so much pressure.
[393:03.62]But when people tell you to backflip, I mean, yeah, that's a little too much pressure, I think.
[393:15.25]I'm not sure I could do that.
[393:18.15]Alright.
[393:18.75]Refresh my memory.
[393:19.49]It was over here, right?
[393:20.21]I had to go through this door and spin around.
[393:27.13]here right through the doors and then left and then around pepe no it's not this way I still I need the last shard where is it oh the side oh wait there's an item that I didn't get too right if I remember
[393:54.35]And I'd like to know what that was that hit me.
[393:56.79]It wasn't on my screen.
[393:58.20]Was it on yours?
[393:59.82]I didn't see shit.
[394:10.11]Did I get it already?
[394:12.13]There's one on the other side, isn't there?
[394:33.89]I don't remember.
[394:40.25]Wait, was it over here?
[394:41.63]Yeah, it was, right?
[394:42.84]Was it all the way around and left?
[394:50.46]Oh my fucking god.
[394:51.56]Get out of my goddamn way.
[395:02.46]I guarantee if you opened up Mario Sunshine right now, you'd get 10,000 viewers.
[395:07.34]I don't have it.
[395:08.22]I don't own it.
[395:10.82]There it is.
[395:11.20]Starter key.
[395:14.22]How do I do something I don't have?
[395:21.33]Go download it.
[395:38.87]Do you want to go download Mario Sunshine right now?
[395:47.38]Even you saying those words, even us just saying this out loud together, you just got me on the Nintendo FBI list, okay?
[395:57.51]We can't even talk about this right now.
[395:59.33]That's a first-party Nintendo game.
[396:00.85]Are you out of your goddamn mind saying that out loud?
[396:12.41]Here we go.
[396:24.14]No, I... We also... We also got one of my favorite games.
[396:28.11]Coming up too.
[396:34.27]I got both Beautiful Joes, which are fantastic.
[396:37.33]Best fucking games.
[396:43.80]Beautiful Joe is so much fun.
[396:45.84]The music is perfect, too.
[396:47.78]Alright, here we go.
[396:50.08]Let's do it.
[396:50.56]Keep him in range.
[397:01.65]Just jump over him.
[397:06.91]How did that miss?
[397:08.51]Sorry!
[397:17.23]Why are you not... Really?
[397:20.91]Dude.
[397:23.41]Dude.
[397:24.03]What in the name of fucking god?
[397:25.59]The game locks onto bats 5,000 feet in the air, but not on this guy's head.
[397:38.50]Holy shit, this guy sucks.
[397:39.76]This boss eats ass.
[397:51.67]You're gonna dive across the whole room?
[398:04.32]What?
[398:08.57]What?
[398:10.49]What?
[398:11.57]What?
[398:30.45]We're both doing the same fucking moves!
[398:37.22]I gotta jump- I'm gonna jump over him.
[398:45.42]Fuck!
[398:54.27]What in the name are you doing?!
[398:55.75]What are you doing?!
[398:57.21]It's gonna hit me!
[398:58.23]Take the fucking goddamn thing.
[399:03.96]But he- Stop st- What the fuck is happening to my brain?
[399:12.71]I was here, don't say that yet!
[399:58.88]I gotta move this back.
[400:01.32]Yola's crying?
[400:01.80]What happened?
[400:36.35]Why is it so dark in there?
[400:38.19]It's not, I just... Listen.
[400:45.45]My streams start at about 2 p.m.
[400:47.71]Pacific, which is during the day.
[400:49.58]Sun is blazing outside, right?
[400:51.32]Sun is outside, shining down on my face.
[400:54.02]And it's bright into the windows, and it's bright in the room.
[400:56.10]It's this daylight.
[400:57.46]Over the course of the stream, time goes by.
[401:00.56]And it becomes nighttime at about 9 o'clock Pacific time.
[401:05.56]I have lights on in here.
[401:06.78]It's just the exposure from the camera want me to prove it in real time.
[401:11.42]In real time.
[401:17.19]Ready?
[401:17.43]See?
[401:23.11]Let's go back to being a little bit... That's too much.
[401:40.55]I stream over the course of a whole day goes by.
[401:42.99]Nice chin beard.
[401:49.54]That's a shadow.
[401:58.64]And I'm ready for school with my backpack.
[402:07.87]Don't die here.
[402:16.87]But this could be a good farm spot right now.
[403:01.94]Didn't even take one point of damage.
[403:06.79]Alright, I'm out.
[403:19.97]Bye.
[403:23.47]I'm gonna fart so people come back.
[403:31.64]Didn't even take one point until right there.
[403:33.50]Alright, let's go.
[403:40.30]Is it this one?
[403:44.10]I don't remember.
[403:50.80]He's recreating the lighthouse.
[403:53.46]That's a good farm spot right here.
[404:04.51]This game's boring is to read him some chat every 12 seconds to keep himself entertained.
[404:07.89]I do that already!
[404:08.97]I re- I- It's to my detriment, is what you meant to say.
[404:14.21]I will get lost in a- I will get lost in a room with one door because I look at chat every five seconds.
[404:24.18]I love reading chat.
[404:25.16]I love participating.
[404:26.14]I love seeing what you guys have to say.
[404:27.70]I love it.
[404:38.08]It'd be like if I was on stage and there were 5,000 people in the audience, and I was facing away from the audience, just talking.
[404:45.58]No, I want to see you guys.
[404:46.80]Who's back there?
[405:01.11]Get some more.
[405:01.55]Grind a little bit.
[405:23.02]That felt good.
[405:23.66]Stop getting hit.
[405:29.36]Actually, I kind of am.
[405:34.76]Ew.
[405:35.96]Oh.
[405:37.56]You could have said anything else.
[405:40.02]Anything else but that.
[405:54.54]apricot weird champ what is weird champ I've seen people write that I don't see it though what is that when I um when my like back and chest were hurting last night and I was like ah fuck I was like making weird faces I saw a bunch of weird champs what's that mean
[406:41.18]Oh.
[406:41.38]Oh, okay.
[406:42.20]So it... What is it?
[406:45.56]What is it?
[406:46.02]What is it?
[406:46.94]What's the emotion?
[406:48.21]What's it conveying?
[406:48.93]What do you use it for?
[406:49.65]Let's go back to time.
[406:58.74]Confusion.
[407:00.80]Unacceptable behavior.
[407:11.67]okay I'm fresh out of ideas you know what bothers me most is that while we're sitting being freaked out out there digging up all sorts of stuff calm down teasel you're going to burst he won't beat us to the treasure no one will as long as that big door is still locked all we have to do is make sure we get rid of them before then right
[407:37.20]Oh, my head!
[407:38.14]That would've been funny.
[407:39.60]Slam the desk.
[407:40.30]See?
[407:40.44]Yeah, it happened.
[407:41.98]That's right!
[408:18.41]Remember, I'm the casting director for Gremlins 3.
[408:20.23]We were wondering if you'd like to play Gizmo.
[408:23.28]We would save a lot of money on puppets if you agree.
[408:32.02]This one is way more important.
[408:33.36]My back is killing me from my current office chair.
[408:35.04]I do a lot of 3D modeling at home, so I sit in it for many hours.
[408:38.04]I'm going around asking streamers what chairs they're using.
[408:40.69]You wouldn't mind if you could tell me what your chair is.
[408:42.27]Uh...
[408:47.26]I actually have a really, really, really good chair.
[408:51.32]I have... This is... Let me get the name right.
[408:54.31]This thing was like $400.
[408:59.57]It's like one of the best chairs I could possibly buy.
[409:06.77]What the hell is it called?
[409:07.57]It's called like... It's got a name.
[409:10.59]It's like the... The Quadro or something.
[409:21.38]What is it called?
[409:21.98]It's got a name.
[409:29.02]It's got, like, an actual name here.
[409:31.98]Let me see, what is it called?
[409:36.39]Is this a bit?
[409:36.95]No, no, no, it's not.
[409:38.65]Uh... What's it called?
[409:42.67]Let me see.
[409:46.47]No, no, no... No, what's it called?
[409:53.77]What is it called?
[409:54.39]That's the cube.
[409:58.45]The shit- the quattro.
[409:59.63]The shit quattro titanium?
[410:05.62]What the fuck is this chair?
[410:11.40]It has a name.
[410:13.34]It's a weird name.
[410:15.85]It probably says it on the back.
[410:22.88]Alright, it's called... Important for your safety during assembly, make sure to tighten bolts... Here.
[410:30.38]It's like the... the... the... the... the... quadra, like the quattro. Quad- it's got a name.
[410:49.45]Oh my god, I don't know what this is called.
[410:51.59]It's gonna... I'm gonna lose my mind.
[410:52.87]Quattro?
[410:58.22]No.
[411:01.58]Does somebody have it?
[411:05.48]No, that's me standing on a stool that's, like, just feet, okay?
[411:09.89]Is this it?
[411:13.15]No, you said... I've already seen it.
[411:15.17]Um, office chair...
[411:17.74]It's like the quadruple.
[411:25.92]Just hold on.
[411:26.88]It's not from Staples.
[411:31.25]I'll find it.
[411:34.03]I just need to... Just give me a minute.
[411:43.39]I just typed in office chair quadra.
[411:56.06]Quad office chair.
[411:57.12]Quad.
[411:59.28]Oh my god, I'm gonna go to my email and like look up the receipt for this.
[412:03.30]Uh... You got it?
[412:11.80]The WorkPro Quantum 9000 series.
[412:15.54]I think that's correct.
[412:23.82]Yes.
[412:24.70]It's the WorkPro Quantum.
[412:29.60]But I think it's like the 4000.
[412:36.92]How did I... How did we find it?
[412:41.10]Yeah.
[412:41.70]WorkPro Quantum Ergonomic Chair.
[412:44.48]There it is.
[412:45.94]You found it.
[412:46.32]That's the chair that I have.
[412:48.78]I couldn't think of the word quantum because I didn't think that it was that... Because we just were saying the word quantum a bunch of times.
[412:54.74]Like a week, like a day or two ago.
[412:56.34]Alright, let's go.
[413:00.38]It's a quantum chair.
[413:02.78]My old office had those.
[413:03.72]They're amazing.
[413:04.32]Yeah, it's very good, but I need it.
[413:08.65]It's got this great lumbar support.
[413:10.41]It's got a really good seat.
[413:13.19]It moves around.
[413:13.97]I said it was $400.
[413:16.99]Yes, it's $315 now.
[413:18.85]So, I mean, I bought this chair like almost two years ago, so...
[413:23.64]Of course, the price is going to come down.
[413:38.75]With this, we should be able to repair the flutter.
[413:41.53]Hooray!
[413:42.17]Let's go, Mega Man!
[413:43.01]Let's go fix the flutter!
[413:51.80]I can assure you this chair is definitely a thousand times better.
[413:55.10]Mega Man, could you take care of the refractor?
[413:57.76]And those, like, men in black seats that everybody sits in for some reason on Twitch.
[414:06.45]Finished.
[414:11.77]It's ready.
[414:15.35]Okay, I'm all done here too.
[414:17.27]I'm going to fire up the engine, Mega Man.
[414:19.29]You grab that blue lever there.
[414:21.17]Gotcha.
[414:24.01]This one, right?
[414:25.11]I worked at Office Max and no one ever bought that chair.
[414:27.81]Ready.
[414:28.87]Missing out.
[414:29.45]Cell switch on.
[414:30.75]Refractor rotation speed increasing.
[414:33.18]Engine field generation at 80%.
[414:34.94]Safety lock check.
[414:37.16]Initiating countdown.
[414:38.86]Three, two, one.
[414:41.40]Mega Man, now!
[414:42.84]Here goes.
[414:47.53]Metastatic field operational.
[414:49.67]Pair production active.
[414:51.49]Come on, fly!
[414:56.20]We're flying!
[414:57.02]Let's go!
[415:01.80]We did it, we made it!
[415:06.90]It worked!
[415:07.72]You did it, Roll!
[415:08.92]We're flying!
[415:10.18]We're flying!
[415:12.57]I'm hungry.
[415:13.69]Damn.
[415:13.81]What did I eat today?
[415:14.59]Chili lime?
[415:15.47]We're flying!
[415:15.89]We're flying!
[415:16.29]Not mac and cheese.
[415:17.29]I'm trying to stay away from cheese.
[415:45.28]I'm trying to cut down on cheese and bread.
[415:47.86]I'm trying to cut my intake of cheese, bread, and red meat.
[415:59.11]Though I just ate a whole package of red meat.
[416:02.95]So... That's going well.
[416:04.71]Alright, so what... What can we do with this?
[416:15.84]Looks like a large computer.
[416:29.75]Vegan?
[416:30.53]Well, no, I said red meat.
[416:33.79]Off limits to everybody.
[416:47.75]It's certainly well made, but it's pretty strange looking.
[417:00.58]It's the best room in the game.
[417:06.43]Oh, there he is, finally, Grandpa.
[417:08.57]Hi, Mega Man.
[417:09.85]Amelia asked me to find out what I could about that treasure that's supposed to be buried here.
[417:14.94]This island just got so many mysteries, I just don't know where to start looking.
[417:18.94]Mega Man, have you ever heard of the Main Gate?
[417:22.42]Yes.
[417:23.18]Yes, I believe.
[417:24.06]Oh, you have, eh?
[417:25.60]And you probably already know this, but the largest ruin on the island is called the Main Gate, and can be found near the Old City.
[417:33.80]What's unusual about it is that as far as anyone knows, there's no way to get inside.
[417:39.41]I have a theory that it's connected in some way with the sub gates.
[417:44.65]Tell me, Mega Man, have you ever found a passage in the sub gate that connects to the main gate?
[417:50.57]No.
[417:51.72]If I'm right, some gate in the closer woods is some kind of key for the main gate.
[417:56.37]And I'm willing to bet anything that the treasure in those pirates will go after is inside the main gate.
[418:01.01]They'll probably realize how close they are and get into the treasure.
[418:04.98]Don't let your guard down.
[418:06.36]Thank you.
[418:09.16]Elderly fuck.
[418:10.98]Hey, alright, turn the person off for five seconds.
[418:22.72]This is Roll's room.
[418:25.60]Any items?
[418:28.94]Hi.
[418:29.22]Okay, bye.
[418:30.74]Is this Mega Man's room?
[418:42.08]Where is Mega Man's room?
[418:43.18]Is this my room?
[418:48.02]No, this is an old person's room.
[418:49.94]For sure.
[418:53.04]It's a first aid box.
[418:54.58]But you don't really need it as long as Data's around.
[419:00.98]It's your bed.
[419:01.88]Why do I have a heat lamp?
[419:16.49]My room sucks.
[419:17.59]Alright, what's the old guy's room?
[419:25.79]This is the old guy's room.
[419:29.11]It's a chest.
[419:30.25]Is there anything inside?
[419:30.97]Bomb schematic.
[419:39.62]Uh... Grandpa's...
[419:53.08]Does he sleep in the sarcophagus?
[419:54.60]Yo, is he a vampire?
[419:56.88]Alright, I'm getting out of this.
[419:57.72]We have to go... What do we have to do?
[420:00.76]I don't remember.
[420:02.28]It said something.
[420:08.03]What does it say?
[420:09.99]We have to find a way to open the gate.
[420:18.95]What a wonderful little ring!
[420:20.97]Did you really find it underground?
[420:22.45]It's so nice.
[420:26.28]You can have it.
[420:27.76]You mean I can have it?
[420:29.54]Well, thank you so much, Mega Man.
[420:31.88]I promise I'll always wear it.
[420:35.59]I wonder what's inside the Closer Woods sub-gate.
[420:38.25]Whatever it is, though, you can be sure those pirates will be after it, too.
[420:41.53]Be careful.
[420:42.67]Wasn't I already there?
[420:49.15]There you go.
[420:50.61]The bomb schematic was used to make the Grand Grenade Special Weapon.
[420:56.49]It allows you to shoot out even stronger grenade bombs.
[421:00.95]They're really powerful.
[421:01.85]You might even be able to use them to blow up walls inside the ruins.
[421:07.45]Well, would you look at that.
[421:10.65]That's how you break open the walls.
[421:14.21]Okay.
[421:15.05]Grand Grenade.
[421:18.41]And now we're going to enhance the Grand Grenade.
[421:22.17]We're going to make it... That's $100,000.
[421:24.41]This is all very expensive.
[421:39.50]Damn.
[421:42.38]If you compliment her every week for a year, you can marry her.
[421:47.72]I don't know.
[421:48.16]No grinding.
[421:48.94]I'm going to use it.
[421:51.50]Let's go.
[421:52.48]Closer of mind.
[421:53.28]Support car.
[421:56.23]Take me to... Where is it?
[422:00.39]Uptown?
[422:01.53]Downtown.
[422:02.07]Uptown.
[422:06.43]Quickly for a year.
[422:15.02]Other weapons can break walls too.
[422:16.54]FYI.
[422:17.46]I have to go talk to her in her room.
[422:27.50]To get the next dungeon.
[422:28.56]Okay.
[422:35.45]This monkey never stops dancing.
[422:38.81]You'd think that you would stop at some point.
[422:41.07]Even to rest for one minute.
[422:42.31]Alright, we gotta... Where was it?
[422:43.49]We gotta go back to the...
[422:51.85]Uh, back to the... forest, right?
[422:54.53]Yeah.
[423:03.02]We'll be at the flutter.
[423:06.06]Monkey's wearing a diaper.
[423:14.79]I tried to get in!
[423:15.75]Let me in or I'm gonna... Alright, where's the roll?
[423:26.18]What?
[423:27.84]Oh.
[423:27.96]Never mind.
[423:56.29]Go to the sub gate.
[423:58.87]Yes.
[423:59.93]Remember, what are those three wacky numbers in the back of your credit card?
[424:18.04]They are kind of weird.
[424:18.78]Like, what are they even there for?
[424:21.42]That's so strange.
[424:22.28]What is this?
[424:25.39]Let me see.
[424:32.36]Oh, no, right.
[424:33.48]I don't have a credit card.
[424:34.26]I don't even have a bank account.
[424:35.94]I pay cash with everything.
[424:55.76]Absolute fucking Chad.
[425:12.19]Yeah, when I bought my car, I just shook the guy's hand with, like, nine grand in hundreds.
[425:21.79]He was like, sir, sir, the car was only $6,400.
[425:23.61]I was like, yeah.
[425:27.71]He's like, okay, alright.
[425:39.52]Scary.
[425:45.52]I've never seen a site like this before.
[425:48.56]There's a big pit in the middle and I can't get any readings from inside.
[425:53.01]I wonder what could be in there.
[425:54.57]Jump in the pit, Mega Man.
[425:56.03]It'll punch your desk.
[426:00.73]It'll make my daughter really happy.
[426:04.48]Tell your daughter that... I would talk to my daughter about... Mega Man?
[426:07.58]That's like just... Are you okay?
[426:09.10]No.
[426:09.64]Can you see a door somewhere?
[426:13.70]Is it...
[426:15.96]There are many doors.
[426:22.46]I can't get any readings of that room, Mega Man.
[426:25.82]My monitor's completely blank.
[426:28.61]Take a look around and let me know what you see.
[426:32.19]This is a big place.
[426:33.11]We got computers.
[426:34.39]It's my guess the power's out in that room.
[426:37.53]Can you see a switch anywhere?
[426:40.45]I don't see any switches.
[426:42.58]But there's some writing here.
[426:45.17]let's see it says operations room to emergency system activation requires direct password input from Eden or the insertion of three level two or three ID card prototype and throw unit ID cards
[427:09.97]what's a prototype anthro unit stop he's supposed to be like 10. well whatever that is you need three id cards right if we're lucky you'll be able to find them inside there it's ancient writing yeah well guys he's not reading off of a dinner menu
[427:37.39]This ancient alien text, you think he can read that well?
[427:40.69]Alright, there's a door back here.
[427:51.80]Uh-oh, whoa!
[428:06.85]Oh shit, there's more than one?
[428:21.70]Oh, there's three now!
[428:22.72]Are they multiplying?
[428:23.72]I got an idea.
[428:28.82]I missed all of them.
[428:32.44]That was fantastic.
[428:55.35]I missed my vacuum.
[429:01.57]Okay.
[429:14.86]Check for lice?
[429:20.48]Well, I just jumped off the edge because I got scared at the...
[429:26.52]And there was a chest right there.
[429:27.46]Wonderful.
[429:28.46]That's wonderful.
[429:35.27]Okay, we're good.
[429:38.95]Guidance unit?
[429:40.05]That's probably homing.
[429:43.61]I would absolutely take a homing missile right now.
[429:55.23]let's explore the rest of this hold on just like the when nice knock them off
[430:25.87]Is this endgame?
[430:27.17]Are we in endgame?
[430:29.09]Anybody know?
[430:30.19]Close.
[430:30.76]I don't think I can get up there from here.
[430:57.30]might really this big one alright I got one id card this one did you find something megaman I don't have lice I think I found an id card good going I'll go back to that control room once I found the others
[431:27.74]Oh, it's past midnight.
[431:28.56]It's past midnight.
[431:29.26]It's past midnight.
[431:31.34]Oh, and they've been eating macaroni and cheese right out of the stove top thing.
[431:35.86]Right out of the pan.
[431:37.58]Oh, this is bad.
[431:38.88]This is bad.
[431:39.74]They've been eating mac and cheese right out of the pan.
[431:47.44]I don't know what to do.
[431:48.26]I'm going to slowly make a quick joke.
[431:52.88]I'm going to make a small joke and see if they're very rowdy.
[431:58.77]Look at that enemy spider right here.
[432:04.24]Giant enemy spider.
[432:05.10]Please, God, please, God, don't hurt me.
[432:09.32]Don't eat me.
[432:12.94]Oh, shit, this guy is big.
[432:25.64]I need more damage than this.
[432:42.36]This is atrocious.
[432:43.70]This is atrocious damage.
[433:08.15]It's right here.
[433:10.19]Huh?
[433:41.54]I just did it!
[433:42.62]The ceiling was breakable.
[433:52.54]Wait.
[433:53.76]Is this ceiling not breakable?
[433:55.80]Look at that!
[433:56.48]No, it's not.
[433:57.08]Yeah, look at that!
[434:02.01]Okay.
[434:15.25]on the map.
[434:17.05]I can't open it.
[434:27.24]I'm trying just to open.
[434:31.50]Wrong weapon?
[434:32.46]No, this is the super grenade thing.
[434:41.01]You have to throw it higher.
[434:44.63]No fucking way.
[434:49.29]How did I not- I did that twice!
[435:08.91]If you did a backflip, I'd be stoked.
[435:11.58]Maybe one day.
[435:12.24]If you're good.
[435:18.28]No response.
[435:18.88]Now I gotta find a generator.
[435:58.06]Hey, really?
[435:59.06]You can't be serious.
[436:01.52]What the hell are you doing standing there?
[436:10.39]Well, I have... Where have I not gone?
[436:11.47]I have one keycard.
[436:13.67]There's a bunch of places back here I could have gone.
[436:20.77]I'm going to try this way.
[436:30.40]This is just a way out.
[436:37.11]Or is it?
[436:47.03]Please.
[436:47.75]There's no response in here either.
[436:49.33]Okay, great.
[436:52.08]Chat's gone psycho.
[436:53.06]Yeah, this happened like three hours ago.
[436:54.64]I don't know what you're talking about.
[437:05.87]Go back this way.
[437:14.88]Okay.
[437:17.38]This way.
[437:25.92]Haven't been in here.
[437:26.76]Oh, you can open doors?
[437:34.05]You need to open them, dude.
[437:49.03]Never when I tried to kill the chat with sub only.
[437:51.25]I do.
[437:51.59]Oh, I'm raising my hand.
[437:53.19]Oh shit, they're learning.
[438:00.93]They're learning.
[438:01.53]I'm like seven plus hours into this game and you give me less than a thousand zeny.
[438:16.34]Kela Lens.
[438:26.46]Let's go right in the middle.
[438:28.12]In here.
[438:39.89]No, this is the exit.
[438:43.89]Hmm.
[438:46.77]Where have I not seen?
[438:47.78]I mean, I have one.
[438:53.84]You only need two more ID cards.
[438:56.99]Shit.
[439:18.83]Sorry, this message requires a Gerha Gold account.
[439:29.72]Alright.
[439:32.10]Where have I not gone?
[439:33.22]Directly in the middle?
[439:34.72]I thought I did.
[439:35.36]Here we go.
[439:37.34]I don't think I have any more Canteen.
[439:58.96]I gotta be careful here.
[439:59.82]I don't want to repeat it last time.
[440:02.88]Are they behind me too?
[440:05.82]No.
[440:07.32]Fuck!
[440:07.64]Put it down, put it down, put it down!
[440:33.85]Is this Nintendo 64?
[440:35.14]No.
[440:36.50]This is just on PlayStation.
[440:38.28]PlayStation 1.
[440:38.78]On a PlayStation 2.
[440:45.06]PS1 on PS2.
[440:45.91]It's emulated.
[440:50.73]This is not emulated.
[440:52.25]Sorry.
[440:52.83]I did not download this.
[441:00.82]Uh...
[441:03.51]This is a... No, I want to... This is a boss room.
[441:08.76]What the hell is this shit?
[441:09.80]Oh, I can use the elevator.
[441:11.86]Don't turn around.
[441:12.60]There's going to be something right behind me.
[441:14.72]If I turn around, then it pops in and it gets actually rendered into the game's engine.
[441:24.64]So don't turn around.
[441:41.73]There's probably a hole in here.
[441:42.53]Another ID card.
[441:56.26]I need one more!
[441:57.19]And then we're at the last boss!
[442:01.45]That's what one person told me.
[442:03.13]They said, dude, you're at the last boss with these ID cards.
[442:05.83]And I'm like, fucking nice.
[442:11.84]I am going to leave and save, though.
[442:14.08]And refill my canteen.
[442:17.42]This is dangerous.
[442:27.07]Coward.
[442:27.67]I want to live.
[442:28.39]I don't want to lose 40 minutes of progress again.
[442:31.51]Okay.
[442:42.04]Straight down.
[442:42.52]Uh-oh.
[442:52.58]Why are we getting a... Ooh!
[443:04.99]Wait.
[443:05.99]This is... I know where this is.
[443:13.87]Was I not close enough?
[443:15.03]Or what?
[443:19.75]Was I not close enough to that?
[443:22.63]How?
[443:26.01]Dude, this is underneath my house.
[443:27.41]What?
[443:28.65]No fucking way.
[443:44.73]You motherfucker.
[443:45.37]Alright, I'm going back.
[443:47.81]I'm going back.
[443:48.35]I'm going back.
[443:48.73]I got two ID cards.
[443:49.39]I'm going back.
[443:49.87]I'm out of here.
[443:50.23]It would be a mistake to try to keep going.
[443:53.49]You gonna brush your teeth?
[444:03.18]How do I get back?
[444:04.54]Remember?
[444:04.86]It was back here, right?
[444:13.10]I need to go down this way.
[444:14.02]At least it's health.
[444:29.23]I have items to give to roll as well.
[444:33.41]Oh yeah, I don't want to stay down here.
[444:34.89]Target sensor.
[444:40.81]Front flips are superior.
[444:42.51]Front flips are actually harder to do, I think, than back flips in some regards.
[445:03.34]I definitely can't do it anymore.
[445:07.00]And I really hope that there's some recording of me doing it.
[445:10.12]But I used to actually be able to do a full backflip from standing on the ground.
[445:14.92]I could not do a frontflip, though.
[445:17.87]No matter how hard I tried, I could never do it.
[445:27.11]Frontflips always were impossible for me.
[445:33.06]Can I get out of here from this?
[445:35.04]I think I can, right?
[445:35.82]If I go this way?
[445:42.55]ancient book well that's cool nice I can't leave though alright I just want to get out of this
[446:11.93]Alright, is it straight ahead?
[446:13.17]I think it's straight ahead.
[446:26.38]Can I not destroy those walls?
[446:27.70]I don't think I can destroy those walls.
[446:32.82]Wait, where the fuck am I going?
[446:34.38]I'm so turned around right now.
[446:39.13]Oh, this is the generator room.
[446:42.96]I've got to go back to the room with the chests in it.
[446:47.46]And then I forget after that.
[446:48.80]I've got to go this way.
[447:00.55]Dermot, do a... I... Hold on.
[447:06.65]It's the Jebaited song, that's... Okay, I got it.
[447:13.86]That was the secret room.
[447:17.04]Alright, here we are.
[447:28.36]So, back this way... In here, right?
[447:33.69]I think?
[447:37.21]I don't remember, I have no idea.
[447:42.27]Uh, yes?
[447:45.13]Yes?
[447:47.89]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[447:51.45]What's over here?
[447:57.25]I can't tell if you hate this game or if you hate streaming in general.
[448:00.69]I can't tell if you're really Mr. Comcast or if you stole that name and it's identity, if you're stealing a company as the identity.
[448:10.14]I can't tell.
[448:12.71]We're both on the same page.
[448:13.65]Oh, I have power!
[448:20.14]Holy shit, I got power.
[448:26.08]Wait a minute.
[448:35.82]We have you on camera?
[448:45.16]Alright, I gotta stop reading chat and figure out how to get the fuck out of here.
[448:49.08]Here we go.
[448:56.96]Dermot doesn't pay taxes.
[449:02.10]Yeah, I do, actually.
[449:03.76]I'm back.
[449:14.80]Alright, roll.
[449:15.33]Come here.
[449:22.83]What was that reaction?
[449:25.56]Yes, I do.
[449:26.50]Yes, I do.
[449:44.89]Okay, let's make an item.
[449:50.21]He's probably painfully aware of how much he pays.
[449:56.44]Active Buster.
[450:03.82]Fires a homing missile that will track the nearest enemy.
[450:06.76]Okay, so homing.
[450:08.77]Still a lot of enhancements it could make.
[450:10.71]I'm enhancing this one.
[450:13.07]I'm going to spend a ton of money on it.
[450:22.51]Buster Sniper Scope.
[450:25.15]It increases your firing range as far as it will go.
[450:31.49]So, I max out my range?
[450:34.83]Hold on, let's take a look.
[450:35.81]Can I keep the Grand Grenade on, though?
[450:38.96]I feel like I need it for this level.
[450:43.10]Normal Arm Machine Buster.
[450:55.08]What should I put on?
[450:55.74]Maybe the Machine Buster.
[451:00.84]I'm gonna try it.
[451:08.95]Or Active Buster.
[451:09.85]Hold on.
[451:11.49]Powered Buster, Grenade Arm, Vacuum Arm, Active Buster.
[451:20.15]Let's enhance it.
[451:23.21]Active Buster.
[451:24.57]Attack.
[451:25.45]It's also expensive.
[451:27.07]Homing capability.
[451:32.14]I have a lot of money, but do I want to spend it on here?
[451:38.74]Upgrades homing capability.
[451:40.18]Let's go.
[451:51.85]I want it.
[451:56.01]More spiring speed.
[452:01.18]More range.
[452:01.66]That's $20,000.
[452:02.24]Ammo.
[452:02.34]I think it better be good.
[452:31.21]Talk to Data.
[452:33.07]Energy Charge!
[452:33.93]Okay, save again.
[452:43.76]This is a Boss Wrecker?
[452:52.82]Go back in.
[453:02.27]Uh, we want to talk to Roll.
[453:03.75]This is my first time playing this.
[453:11.66]Go back to the far- wait, that's where I want to go?
[453:14.16]Wait.
[453:17.14]That's where I want to go, right?
[453:17.98]No, no, no, I want to go to the sub-gate.
[453:21.57]No, no, I'm already at the sub-gate, right?
[453:23.45]Just leave.
[453:25.59]Uh, this is my first time playing through this game, yes.
[453:27.91]I've played it before, a long time ago.
[453:31.47]I never got past a certain point.
[453:38.36]I actually think the first two hours, three hours of the game.
[453:41.72]Did I get the energy canteen?
[453:43.94]Nah.
[453:44.75]Fuck it.
[453:47.49]Alright, now I can go to the elevator.
[453:54.72]So that other elevator was... Where was it?
[454:00.17]I don't remember.
[454:01.17]Over here?
[454:02.55]I don't remember where the other elevator was!
[454:08.79]Anybody have any idea?
[454:09.75]Is anybody else as lost as I am?
[454:16.81]It might be time for food.
[454:19.51]Real food.
[454:23.61]Because people are writing hash house a go-go in the chat.
[454:26.45]And... I mean, you're trying to get me to turn the stream off.
[454:32.95]Like, that's actively... Oh my god, hash house a go-go is so fucking delicious.
[454:38.79]I'm turning off the stream.
[454:40.82]That's what's happening with what you guys are doing.
[454:43.30]I just want to be completely transparent with you.
[454:47.02]Okay, thanks.
[454:47.48]See you guys later.
[454:51.85]It's been a fun stream.
[454:52.45]I had a lot of fun.
[454:52.91]This game's good.
[455:03.54]I want to see what's up at the top of this elevator.
[455:07.48]Let's test this item.
[455:09.82]Pretty good.
[455:12.74]Looks like arcane missiles.
[455:14.27]Alright, where's that elevator?
[455:33.42]Do we play this again?
[455:34.39]Oh, I'm going to absolutely finish this game the next time we stream.
[455:38.93]100%.
[455:38.99]I probably only have like a couple hours left to hit that.
[455:42.73]I 1000% am going to finish this the next time the stream turns on.
[455:47.86]And then we'll move on to something else.
[455:49.48]I have a ton of PlayStation games.
[455:50.74]I've got a lot of stuff behind me.
[455:54.32]Um.
[455:56.68]Don't play this ever again.
[455:59.91]It's right here.
[456:00.41]Is it right here?
[456:06.85]Is this it?
[456:07.36]No.
[456:08.14]Two holes in here, though.
[456:08.94]Did I open these?
[456:15.76]I'm trying to leave.
[456:19.22]That actually... Yeah, it's probably time to call it.
[456:21.91]I'm getting really hungry.
[456:22.77]Why'd you guys have to do that?
[456:24.41]Why'd you guys have to stay at all those delicious food places?
[456:27.63]And now I'm having trouble remembering where doors go.
[456:29.63]Yeah, it's time for food.
[456:33.95]That's how you can quantify if it's time to stop streaming.
[456:36.37]Do you remember where a door leads to?
[456:38.21]I don't know.
[456:39.94]It's probably time for you to take in some protein and maybe some milk.
[456:43.64]Almond milk, not cow's milk.
[456:44.88]I don't drink that.
[456:45.46]Fuck, I really want Hash House to go go now.
[457:04.03]I really, really want it.
[457:06.73]Really bad.
[457:12.10]Like, really bad.
[457:22.30]Let me see what's up here first.
[457:24.62]Do I have to blow this up again?
[457:25.66]Oh, come on.
[457:27.44]What the fuck?
[457:28.40]I gotta blow the... No, I don't.
[457:30.15]I already did this shit.
[457:37.89]Can I just shoot it?
[457:41.12]I don't need to blow it up, right?
[457:50.00]This is where it is though.
[458:07.55]Oat milk?
[458:08.31]I only like almond milk.
[458:09.79]I don't like soy milk.
[458:12.17]I don't like oat milk.
[458:13.01]I don't like coconut milk.
[458:15.50]Almond milk is the only one that I've drank that I've said I don't like.
[458:17.68]Rice milk?
[458:22.00]Mega Man, I'm seeing something funny on my monitor.
[458:26.15]It looks like there's a false wall or something.
[458:28.71]Can I not?
[458:29.91]I already broke it.
[458:30.95]There's probably a secret room in there.
[458:36.52]I changed my weapon because of this.
[458:38.16]Damn it.
[458:54.21]Oh, the stream.
[458:55.03]I was about to turn it off.
[458:57.03]The stream goes on.
[458:58.43]I was there.
[459:00.31]Alright, let's go.
[459:10.89]Hey, Mega Man.
[459:13.05]Have you ever wondered where the Reaverbots came from?
[459:16.85]I mean, who made them?
[459:18.61]Dude, dude, dude.
[459:19.63]Hang up.
[459:20.59]You know, we go around doing gigs all over the place, but... Or is this the reveal where she's the one that's been making them?
[459:26.74]It's almost like stealing.
[459:30.32]Mega Man, I'm picking up three Reaverbots close by.
[459:34.24]Watch out!
[459:42.53]Oh, I almost killed you before you got over to me.
[459:44.33]That would have been awesome.
[459:49.39]Whoa.
[460:04.66]Oh my god.
[460:06.10]What a reaction that was.
[460:08.80]That was, I haven't had a Hash Ox go-go hamburger yet, so that's why you got that reaction.
[460:17.76]Okay.
[460:26.42]No, it's too late for that for me.
[460:32.79]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[460:34.21]Why did you have to fucking say that?
[460:36.63]Why did you have to do that to me?
[460:39.15]It's over.
[460:43.76]The stupidest thing.
[460:45.34]It's not even...
[460:55.51]Epic bacon.
[460:56.31]I gotta... You know what?
[460:59.73]Hold on.
[461:05.74]That's not how you do that.
[461:07.16]I'm dead.
[461:08.04]I'm dead.
[461:08.30]I'm dead.
[461:08.86]I'm dead.
[461:09.47]I'm dead.
[461:09.77]I'm dead.
[461:50.42]No canteen.
[461:51.18]No.
[461:59.07]I can do that.
[461:59.75]I can beat that right now.
[462:00.57]It's like this boss right here.
[462:01.67]I'm not done.
[462:03.85]I can beat that boss.
[462:05.73]I know where it is.
[462:06.57]I'm just going to beat it.
[462:07.25]I'm just going to spam the fuck out of it.
[462:14.04]One more.
[462:14.34]One more try.
[462:14.76]One more.
[462:15.08]And then we can get out of here.
[462:25.01]I already did all this stuff.
[462:25.91]Let's go.
[462:27.91]Check my normal items.
[462:28.71]Let me see if there's any more.
[462:33.73]Oh my god.
[462:34.25]Normal items.
[462:35.03]Shield repair.
[462:35.81]That's what I can need.
[462:38.99]Repairs damage life shield.
[462:43.98]Have I used this?
[462:52.61]Oh, that's the health when it turns red.
[462:54.55]Alright.
[462:55.11]I see.
[462:55.41]That's why I'm not dying instantly.
[463:01.21]Oh my god.
[463:05.23]I forget where to go!
[463:05.91]Where do I go?!
[463:06.37]I actually... I... Why am I like this?
[463:18.47]It's like I try to put it into long term, but it will not go into long term.
[463:24.86]I sit there and I go like, it's this door right here.
[463:26.66]This door.
[463:27.14]This door with the secret thing we need to get rid of the bugs.
[463:29.25]This one.
[463:29.67]And then my other brain just goes, no.
[463:32.11]No, I don't care.
[463:32.83]I don't care.
[463:33.65]Nope.
[463:35.05]I don't want to know.
[463:35.97]Don't tell me anything.
[463:37.11]Nope.
[464:00.40]He's still playing?
[464:03.50]Yeah, I'm gonna be stopping though.
[464:05.04]I'm not gonna be able to finish it in one go.
[464:06.32]It's alright.
[464:07.76]I'll pick it up.
[464:08.56]I love it.
[464:09.21]It's great.
[464:10.49]I love it.
[464:11.65]I love little item combinations and upgrading and finding the item.
[464:15.49]It's fun.
[464:17.23]I think this still holds up pretty well.
[464:18.47]Even though it came out 20 years ago.
[464:21.86]I think this holds up pretty well.
[464:22.72]You know, I would love to see another one.
[464:24.88]I'd love to see another Mega Man Legends.
[464:26.40]Mega Man Legends 3.
[464:29.28]New.
[464:30.00]With the same kind of idea.
[464:34.84]Mega Man, I'm seeing something funny on my monitor.
[464:38.98]It looks like there's a false wall or something.
[464:42.68]There's probably a secret room in there.
[464:46.64]We all would like to see that, yeah.
[464:47.98]I have bad news for you, buddy.
[464:56.11]What's the matter?
[465:01.61]What, did they announce it and cancel it or something?
[465:04.93]They don't make good games anymore?
[465:07.41]Capcom's been on a tear making amazing games the last two or three years.
[465:11.04]What are you talking about?
[465:14.12]You know, we go around doing gigs all over the place, but... Is he actually not?
[465:19.16]No.
[465:19.38]What?
[465:20.28]It's almost like stealing.
[465:23.63]Mega Man!
[465:24.95]I'm picking up three reaver blocks close by.
[465:27.63]Watch out!
[465:28.13]Hold on.
[465:29.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[465:57.82]Just gotta get rid of one.
[465:58.70]Gotta go for the red one.
[466:07.17]Sometimes you gotta jump.
[466:10.47]You learn to scrape?
[466:11.23]No, I knew how to scrape.
[466:12.57]I didn't have a big enough space to do it yet, though.
[466:19.48]This is a really big space.
[466:20.56]That's a lot of stuff.
[466:43.17]Oh my god.
[466:43.91]And... Quick work of you.
[467:19.62]I told you I was going to do it.
[467:22.68]I told you I was going to do it.
[467:25.56]Late night.
[467:26.28]Get it.
[467:32.38]Now, I just have to go through here and get the last key card, and then I'll put him in.
[467:35.95]I'll just finish this.
[467:38.15]Active Buster is incredible.
[467:39.69]Oh, wait.
[467:43.95]I'm up here now.
[467:44.91]Remember I was saying, I don't know if I can get up here.
[467:52.94]I can go.
[467:53.34]Gonna be a keycard, right?
[467:57.14]ID card.
[467:57.66]Got them all.
[467:58.38]Cool.
[467:59.12]There's something else over here.
[468:05.35]No?
[468:05.81]Alright.
[468:06.03]Got all the keycards.
[468:12.77]That's it?
[468:14.01]Let's go.
[468:22.72]Can I just save it?
[468:29.40]What do you think?
[468:29.96]It's like down here, isn't it?
[468:51.81]Finish.
[468:52.85]Finish it.
[468:53.95]I'll at least do the control room.
[469:00.31]Yeah, I'm in no immediate danger.
[469:10.40]Unless it's a back-to-back boss fight.
[469:15.12]Alright.
[469:20.00]I actually don't remember what the control room is.
[469:22.89]I actually have like a legend or something, and I know I should know by now, but... Like the columns?
[469:29.64]Columns?
[469:36.74]There are items in the pillars.
[469:41.24]Wait, this counts as a hole?
[469:42.66]Right, okay.
[469:55.84]I guess it is just a hole.
[470:00.70]Alright.
[470:12.21]Uh, yeah, you know, I think I'll just call it.
[470:14.85]Yeah, eight hours.
[470:16.58]We're good.
[470:16.92]We're good.
[470:17.74]We'll pick it up.
[470:18.20]We'll finish it when we start the next stream.
[470:24.56]Yeah.
[470:27.18]Yeah, yeah.
[470:28.02]Yeah, that's a good place to stop.
[470:35.87]Yeah, yeah.
[470:55.41]He's never gonna finish.
[470:57.43]Raid Joel.
[470:57.99]He said you're not a gamer enough.
[471:00.77]You know you can tell Joel when we raid Joel?
[471:02.90]Because I'm not a gamer enough for this?
[471:10.42]He jumped in, didn't I?
[471:13.70]Wait, go back.
[471:14.22]What do you mean go back?
[471:15.91]Oh, sorry.
[471:16.27]I was talking to you guys.
[471:25.19]Wait, what?
[471:35.71]Don't ever talk to me.
[471:40.48]Wait, hold on.
[471:42.54]I ran past it.
[471:46.14]I'm hungry.
[471:46.98]I'm hungry.
[471:47.74]I need food.
[471:49.80]I need... Red Jerma needs food.
[471:55.19]Red Jerma needs food badly.
[471:58.83]Red Jerma is about to die.
[472:12.70]That game is so good, too.
[472:14.46]Is that rose-colored goggles?
[472:16.84]Or is that game actually still amazing?
[472:18.30]I used to play that game in the arcade every weekend.
[472:23.87]Gauntlet Legends, that game was so good.
[472:27.23]They used to have the thing in the arcade cabinet where you had to put a password in, and it kept your character in the cabinet.
[472:35.53]And you'd get these guys that would come in and just load up eight bucks worth of coins, log into their character, and they'd be level 99, and they would just smoke the whole game.
[472:46.18]Like, why are you even playing at that point?
[472:52.04]These guys have beaten the game like a thousand times.
[472:58.27]Alright, let's save it.
[473:01.07]So, for the next couple of days, I have physical therapy.
[473:06.03]So I'm not going to be around tomorrow or the next day.
[473:10.73]Sorry to say.
[473:12.53]But, the plan is to do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[473:17.01]We'll finish Mega Man Legends.
[473:20.02]We're starting Black and White 2.
[473:21.48]And...
[473:28.26]That's... I want to give Black and White 2 time.
[473:32.61]So... It might be a full 2 streams.
[473:38.83]Maybe we'll throw The Bachelor in there for some fun.
[473:42.38]Maybe Rain World, play it again.
[473:50.20]But Black and White 2 has been on.
[473:51.68]No More Heroes 2, yeah.
[473:52.81]There's a lot.
[473:54.27]I've got so many things.
[473:55.17]I started so many new series.
[473:57.81]Mega Man Legends.
[473:58.59]Gotta play Mega Man Legends 2.
[474:00.04]No More Heroes.
[474:00.60]No More Heroes 2.
[474:01.10]Tony Hawk's Underground.
[474:03.26]Tony Hawk's Underground 2.
[474:04.80]All these games have 2s.
[474:18.12]Dead Rising 3.
[474:18.68]Yeah, but that's not a priority, because nobody likes that game.
[474:23.59]Mario Sunshine, yeah.
[474:24.57]Did he say Black and White 2?
[474:37.11]I did.
[474:37.37]We're going to finish Mega Man Legends, which should take another couple hours.
[474:44.09]And...
[474:47.55]Maybe surprise PlayStation 2 game.
[474:51.13]Maybe just go right into black and white.
[474:53.97]See what I want to do.
[474:57.21]But that's going to wrap it up here.
[474:58.48]Right at almost exactly the 8 hour mark.
[475:02.06]Thanks for joining me.
[475:02.60]I had a lot of fun.
[475:05.04]I love just playing games.
[475:07.82]That are just fun to play.
[475:10.62]And we just talk.
[475:11.27]It's fun.
[475:12.97]I have a blast every time I play these games.
[475:14.63]Alright, so we're out of here.
[475:16.93]I'll see you guys in a couple days on... Let's give you an exact date so you can... Sus will be updated too.
[475:22.85]Uh, Wednesday.
[475:24.77]Wednesday afternoon... I'll be starting.
[475:29.38]Gonna go do some PT.
[475:35.66]And then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... We'll see what happens during the weekend.
[475:39.94]I think we'll come back... Or maybe we'll go four days?
[475:43.11]I don't know.
[475:43.39]We'll see.
[475:44.83]Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[475:45.87]Friday, at least.
[475:50.53]If you've taken off, we'll see you soon.
[475:52.13]We're going to raid Joel in a little bit.
[475:59.12]And we'll see you soon.
[476:01.18]Good night.
[476:02.32]Goodbye.
[476:02.62]Let's do the end of the stream.
[476:05.72]Everything is saved.
[476:06.52]Yeah, I saved it like three times.
[476:07.78]Yeah, I'm good.
[476:08.12]Go ahead and turn this off.
[476:12.30]And turn this on.
[476:17.61]There it goes.
[476:24.00]Let's go back earlier.
[476:24.94]We actually had another $50 from BitSlave.
[476:29.04]BitSlave has given a lot of money.
[476:33.48]This is a large amount of money from BitSlave.
[476:36.53]More than $150.
[476:36.97]They say this video is in our interest.
[476:44.75]Hold on, let me plug this in.
[476:50.58]This is in our interest.
[476:53.08]Let me see.
[476:53.56]I'm going to change my monitor real quick.
[476:58.30]I'm still here drunk.
[477:01.38]Well, take care of yourself.
[477:02.32]Drink some water.
[477:03.00]Drink plenty of water.
[477:05.47]Stay hydrated.
[477:06.57]Get some good sleep.
[477:10.43]Make sure that for every one or two drinks you're drinking, you're drinking a full glass of water.
[477:14.77]People are saying, how do you not have a hangover?
[477:17.79]That's how.
[477:19.56]Just take it slow.
[477:26.57]Yes, that QR's hangovers.
[477:27.79]Oh, yeah, it does.
[477:29.97]It makes you not have them.
[477:33.95]And eating food.
[477:34.81]That's true.
[477:35.75]Alright, so what's this video?
[477:37.05]This video is in our interest.
[477:39.87]This is just titled February 17.
[477:41.79]Alright, General.
[477:45.01]I got banned for 14 days on my League of Legends account.
[477:50.62]You know why?
[477:53.10]Because this Johnny Walker is real good.
[477:55.90]Real good drink right there.
[477:58.58]So if you gamers want to have a good drink, gamer drink, you better drink it, alright?
[478:09.29]Drunk and playing League of Legends.
[478:11.67]Probably not a good mix.
[478:19.92]Johnny, you got banned?
[478:22.26]What did you do?
[478:23.88]What did you do?
[478:24.40]Start drinking water.
[478:25.72]Somebody get some water into this man.
[478:31.02]That's the only way to enjoy that game.
[478:33.48]Didn't somebody say that?
[478:34.38]Or am I just pretending like somebody said that to put forth an opinion of mine?
[478:38.16]I'm not sure.
[478:44.67]Take care of yourself and get some water.
[478:47.39]And eat some food, too.
[478:51.28]Thank you for the huge amount of money over the course of the night, Bitslave.
[478:54.12]Appreciate it.
[478:57.28]Thank you.
[478:58.58]Hope you're having fun.
[479:00.92]But let's teleport back to earlier in the evening.
[479:05.98]Food, true.
[479:06.62]Go, yeah, go eat something.
[479:10.39]Go eat some food.
[479:13.93]We had a thousand bits from Ampharic.
[479:15.49]Thanks, Ampharic.
[479:17.77]Boomer Brace ready.
[479:18.79]Mega Man Legends time.
[479:20.35]Yeah.
[479:21.37]I had a lot of fun.
[479:21.95]This game is really fun.
[479:23.53]It's challenging, but it's also still very accessible.
[479:27.27]It's not too hard.
[479:28.53]It's fun.
[479:29.85]It's not that it's hard.
[479:31.25]It's just fun to play with items and find stuff and talk to people.
[479:39.96]Donate.
[479:40.30]Imagine donating to a millionaire.
[479:42.60]I don't have a million dollars.
[479:44.28]I just want to make that real clear.
[479:46.28]I don't have that much money.
[479:49.58]It'd be cool if I had a million dollars of your fund.
[479:53.16]I would use it to buy a house in cash.
[479:59.69]Imagine.
[480:01.45]I don't have a billion dollars.
[480:02.79]I don't happen to have close to a billion dollars.
[480:06.83]I don't even have close to... I don't even have close to 10% of a million dollars right now.
[480:14.76]Not even close.
[480:15.44]I don't even have close to 20% of a million dollars right now.
[480:17.48]Not even close.
[480:28.76]half a million I don't look at those calculators they don't make any sense one of those calculators said I was worth like eight billion dollars and that's not even true is that even is that a virus website what is this Jerma's not second Jerma is oh my second Jerma account is worth 337 thousand dollars
[480:57.30]So that's what it would be worth if I sold that channel.
[481:09.42]How much money does the second Jerma make?
[481:22.12]No, that... SocialBlade, yo, and here's the dumb thing about SocialBlade.
[481:27.20]SocialBlade likes to do this fun thing where they're not possible to be wrong.
[481:31.52]Turbo985 is worth 38,000 to 12 million.
[481:36.10]Like, okay.
[481:38.33]That's quite a window.
[481:48.77]But what about the main channel?
[481:50.13]How much is that worth?
[481:55.21]Is it even on here?
[481:55.87]It's not even listed.
[481:56.69]It's worth nothing.
[482:03.40]Main channel's not worth anything.
[482:07.52]It's worth $112,000.
[482:07.82]Fuck off, it's worth $112,000.
[482:08.34]What?
[482:08.62]That channel's worth like $2 million.
[482:09.92]That's a million dollar channel.
[482:27.54]You know what I mean?
[482:27.98]There's no growth.
[482:30.80]Oh.
[482:32.00]Like five years ago.
[482:33.12]So I should have... What you're saying is I should have sold it five years ago.
[482:41.05]I held it for too long.
[482:42.91]Now it's only worth 112k.
[482:43.53]Oh.
[482:43.59]Oh well.
[483:00.97]Well, what was that?
[483:03.09]Oh, yeah, right.
[483:04.74]I'm not a millionaire.
[483:06.38]Oh, you guys will know if I ever cross a million dollars.
[483:13.00]You'll know.
[483:13.98]You won't know how you will know if I ever cross one million dollars in my, like, savings account or something.
[483:19.18]If I have a million dollars, I'm going to do something ridiculous.
[483:28.24]I will spend like $500,000 on something insane.
[483:34.05]I will do a mega stream and then that'll be it.
[483:44.90]What are you worth?
[483:47.56]Wait, we're not playing the... Alright, hold on a minute.
[483:49.70]We're not going to play the like... Hey, look at me.
[483:55.59]This is the money I have.
[483:57.43]Hey, look at me.
[483:58.21]Let me tell you.
[483:58.93]There's things you don't... There's things you don't ask somebody.
[484:04.20]How much money do you have in your checking account right now?
[484:07.47]Why would you ask me that?
[484:08.73]Number two, how much money do you have in your savings account right now?
[484:10.90]Number three, um... No, I'm not telling you these things.
[484:14.78]These are private things that I don't... This is my thing, my life.
[484:17.26]He's broke.
[484:27.23]I'm not broke, but I'm not a millionaire.
[484:31.00]I'm, okay, I'll give you a social blade window here.
[484:34.54]I'm worth, right now, anywhere from $21,000 to $61,000 at the moment, right now.
[484:38.99]Pretty sick.
[485:03.51]Somebody said, yeah, right.
[485:06.77]Well, how do you... Alright.
[485:08.09]You know that net worth is about... I spent a lot of money last year on Twitch, on the stream.
[485:22.94]And when I do my taxes this year, my CPA is going to be probably calling me and talking to me about the...
[485:34.27]Some of the financing that I've done on some of the streams that you've seen last year.
[485:39.53]Eh, so.
[485:45.83]Gonna be like, Jeremy, your net worth is $12.
[485:50.13]What happened?
[485:52.55]Well, I decided it was a good idea.
[485:55.96]I'm very nervous right now.
[485:56.80]He's gonna be like, calm down, calm down.
[486:01.92]I'll be like, okay, sorry, sorry.
[486:12.96]Real voice.
[486:15.78]Robots are expensive.
[486:17.24]Yeah, they are.
[486:19.34]They took care of me.
[486:21.07]Very, very, very much so.
[486:34.79]It took... Oh, okay.
[486:37.73]Now, let's put it this way.
[486:38.89]I'm doing just fine.
[486:40.27]I'm doing better than fine.
[486:42.87]Way better than fine.
[486:44.56]Thanks to you guys.
[486:48.70]And all it took was somebody saying, you donated to a millionaire for me to say, no, no, no, no, no, no, excuse me.
[487:05.30]Yeah, but that's because of you.
[487:07.16]That's because of you guys.
[487:08.80]And all the names and all the messages I'm about to read right now.
[487:16.85]That's kind of how this works.
[487:23.91]Let's see who the top hits were.
[487:31.84]Still inaccurate.
[487:32.74]Four and a half months later.
[487:36.26]Does Twitch do your taxes?
[487:37.46]No, you gotta do taxes on your own because I'm not a Twitch employee.
[487:43.48]I have to have a... I have to get somebody to help me do my taxes with me.
[487:50.35]Anyways.
[487:52.57]Oh, where the hell were we?
[487:53.23]Thanks for the 500 bits to Vertible Giant.
[487:55.31]Five dollars, thank you.
[487:59.49]I'm so excited to be playing Mega Man Legends.
[488:00.89]This game enchanted me as a kid.
[488:03.24]It was the reason I even got into games in the first place.
[488:05.22]Hope you enjoy it.
[488:08.17]I did, and I do.
[488:08.91]I'm gonna finish it.
[488:11.91]Bulbaswag, thanks for the six dollars, 600 bits.
[488:15.67]Just wanted to share a weird dream I had.
[488:17.80]So in this dream, I had a tree in my backyard, and I climbed into the tree and looked into my neighbor's backyard.
[488:23.62]I saw you sitting in the tree in the yard opposite of me, like in a bench inside the tree, and I said hi, but you just stared into the distance with sunken eyes.
[488:34.02]Staring into the distance.
[488:42.47]Pretty scary.
[488:42.99]It's pretty weird.
[488:48.08]Hey, Niall Orion, thanks for the 300 bits.
[488:53.08]Every other streamer I follow is playing League of Legends and then there's Jerma playing Mega Man Legends.
[488:57.88]The real legend.
[488:59.98]The only legend.
[489:03.46]Thanks for the 300 bits, though.
[489:08.89]That happened.
[489:13.12]Bitslave, thanks for the 250.
[489:13.90]You forgot to check out my follow-up on Johnny Walker.
[489:16.68]Is this a drunk video?
[489:19.22]I'm not playing League of Legends.
[489:37.17]This is, wait, hold on, this is before he got banned.
[489:40.17]This is before he got banned.
[489:42.29]For 14 days.
[489:43.75]This is pre-ban.
[489:45.03]Because this was like 6 hours, this was like 7 hours ago.
[489:47.85]Pre-ban.
[489:50.23]If you don't believe me, I am Iron 4.
[489:54.41]I'm an Aatrox main, a Lulu main, and a Yuumi main.
[489:57.93]He got banned.
[489:59.61]He drank like 5 more drinks and got fucking banned.
[490:08.53]That's so fucking funny.
[490:10.27]That is very, very funny.
[490:13.00]Oh, I love how we can go back in time and see this.
[490:16.18]What is the music?
[490:37.69]That's the second lowest rank.
[490:40.75]Is it?
[490:41.09]I'm not playing League.
[490:44.58]I can't.
[490:45.16]I'm not doing it.
[490:49.82]I'm not playing League.
[490:55.41]League is just one of those things where I feel like when I do it, if I would ever play it, you get assimilated into the Borg.
[491:05.01]And then you just never stop.
[491:06.25]And that's all you do.
[491:07.79]Oh, no.
[491:08.07]I'm trying to resist the Borg.
[491:15.16]Oh, that's so funny, though.
[491:16.90]That was... That was a great eight-hour setup for that.
[491:21.93]Thank you, Bitsleep.
[491:24.25]Jerma 13 thanks for the 250 hey 985 this is 13 again thanks to the support from your amazing community we've been able to locate and apprehend Jerma 65 before he was able to gain control of the jex module commissioner Jerma 3 is incredibly relieved since he was worried we were going to lose this planet as well our first line of defense has received significant upgrades we're confident we'll be able to defend this planet in the future thanks again for the immense help 13 out I didn't do anything
[491:50.87]You sent me that message, and then I ate a few tacos and went to sleep.
[491:55.63]So whatever you did was good work.
[491:57.78]I didn't do anything.
[492:00.16]I woke up at like 1 o'clock in the afternoon today.
[492:03.96]I had nothing to do with this, but thank you for continuing to defend our planet.
[492:15.50]Hey, Nomegusta, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[492:21.48]Fifteen Dolls.
[492:22.20]First time catching a stream live.
[492:23.66]Hello from South Korea.
[492:24.74]Hey!
[492:26.58]Hello from America.
[492:27.64]Specifically Las Vegas.
[492:30.88]Thanks for the 1500 bits and hello from Korea.
[492:34.68]South Korea.
[492:35.88]Pretty cool.
[492:37.30]Viewers all over the place.
[492:39.89]This community is everywhere.
[492:43.11]NastyBananaMan, thanks for the 500 bits.
[492:44.83]Hey Jerem, I just wanted to say you're one of my favorite streamers and I'm really happy to see you playing one of my favorite games.
[492:51.88]It holds up very well.
[492:56.31]I will say it does hold up incredibly well.
[493:03.12]We also had 250 from Jules.
[493:06.45]jules say hey Jerma after watching the end of the stream from yesterday my brother has been making fun of me relentlessly all day today that my favorite streamer doesn't wash his hands after using the toilet he said the origins of your name is probably not related but he also said that you did not deny not washing your hands after touching the toilet handle and your privates please tell him the truth otherwise I'll have to suplex my brother to the next dimension and I'm half his weight
[493:36.69]What?
[493:39.09]I... Yes, I wash my hands.
[493:41.50]After going to the bathroom.
[493:43.84]In fact, let me go over this with some of you guys.
[493:47.61]I pre-wash before going to the bathroom.
[493:51.11]You get people going into the bathroom, I'm just talking, like, going to the urinal, and they just pull up, down their pants, and pee, and, like, grab their, you know, private, and pee without washing their hands first.
[494:08.53]So, that's all the stuff that you've been touching throughout the course of that day.
[494:14.01]Why not wash your hands first?
[494:15.71]Before you touch your bare, you know...
[494:21.07]And then wash again.
[494:22.33]There's a pre-wash to get the germs off your hands before you touch your... And then there's a second wash after you're done.
[494:32.32]Think about that.
[494:38.24]Imagine, like, grabbing, like, the door handle, even, like, pushing the bathroom door open that's been touched 500 million times and probably cleaned once a week.
[494:47.22]And then you grab your penis.
[494:52.53]I just spit everywhere.
[494:57.41]But I'm being dead serious.
[495:03.25]Can you imagine?
[495:05.03]Not doing a small pre-wash.
[495:06.73]And a pre-wash is not the same as a post-wash.
[495:08.93]A pre-wash is just a little bit of soap and just a little bit under the water.
[495:14.34]Just a little.
[495:15.56]And then the post-wash is to really clean it up.
[495:18.32]I don't know how this is such a strange concept to some of you guys.
[495:31.44]A pre-washing your hands before you touch down there is apparently weird.
[495:37.20]Alright.
[495:41.29]Do you pre-wash before a shower?
[495:45.79]When I'm taking... What?
[495:47.87]The shower is the wash.
[495:49.93]The pre-wash of your hands before touching your penis is because... Saying that word, people are going to fucking clip this and take it and put it somewhere.
[496:02.21]Before I go in the shower, guys, I don't like just start grabbing and like... What?
[496:08.88]You know what's a good idea right now before I get in the shower?
[496:11.64]I'm just gonna like mush my hands down here and... What are you talking about?
[496:16.04]So you open the door or open the curtain to the shower and you get in and turn the water on.
[496:30.39]Next time you go to the doctor, next time you go to the doctor, listen to me.
[496:34.18]Next time you go to the doctor, I want you to just ask the doctor.
[496:37.00]Say, hey, as a medical professional, do you think it's a good idea to wash your hands before you pee into a urinal?
[496:47.83]And I bet you the doctor's going to go, Yeah, that sounds like a good way to avoid getting sick and germs and touching your dick with your hands that you've been grabbing all over stuff and grabbing it on escalator rails.
[496:59.70]And then you pee.
[497:01.08]Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[497:02.20]That's what would happen.
[497:10.14]Anyways, thanks for the $2.50.
[497:10.72]I washed my hands.
[497:11.19]Multiple times.
[497:21.06]potion toilet thanks for the 250. so glad you're finally playing this series it's one of my absolute favorites thanks again don't forget misadventures of tron bone is the mid game between one and two and it's fantastic
[497:45.67]There's over 2,000 people here right now, and I know, I know for a fact that at least 400 or 500 people are sitting there on their TV, they're eating a fucking pizza, and they're pointing at the screen right now going, he's got it.

[498:00.80]He knows.
[498:02.00]I know.

[498:30.21]I know people are like, oh, he makes the joke.
[498:32.17]And then somebody, people sub.
[498:33.59]That's like reverse psychology.

[498:37.59]I'm not going to do that joke anymore.

[499:14.40]Jermo, sorry I got drunk off the Johnny Walker and laid down my heart.
[499:18.26]It happens, but it's true.
[499:20.18]Keep streaming until your boomer body can't take it anymore.
[499:22.46]Boom on, boomer, boom on.
[499:24.54]I'm 34.
[499:26.50]I'm not like 80.
[499:26.94]This is, you know, this is not like the 1400s where people lived to be like 48.
[499:33.49]That was like, wow, that's old.
[499:46.05]But nah, don't worry about it.
[499:46.97]Just take care of yourself.
[499:48.84]Drink some water, get some food.
[499:50.52]Get some rest.
[499:53.92]34 is 50 in internet years.
[499:54.98]That's a really great way to put it.
[499:58.49]It actually is.
[499:59.35]Anything over 30 is like 60 in internet years.
[500:07.21]Hey, Sprite37, thanks for the $5, Sprite.
[500:10.34]Hope you enjoy Mega Man Legends, Jeremy.
[500:13.18]This game is what got me into animation and game development.
[500:17.40]Without it, I doubt I'd be in the professional industry.
[500:21.06]So I'm very happy to watch you play it.
[500:22.46]It's very much a needed pick for me in the busy past weeks.
[500:26.82]Thanks again.
[500:32.85]Yeah, that's awesome.
[500:35.73]That's really, really cool.
[500:42.59]Thank you so much for the $5, and I think the game's great.
[500:47.31]That's the dev in chat.
[500:48.25]Well, that's a dev that's in chat, not this dev.
[500:51.63]Then we had HaroldElbertson985.
[500:53.50]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[500:54.62]We caught it.
[500:56.48]Um, cool name.
[500:58.90]I mean, it's mine, but I guess you could have it too.
[501:02.58]WhiskeyDing!
[501:03.48]Thank you, WhiskeyDing, for the 1,000 bits.
[501:05.26]I'm a maker of bread.
[501:06.16]I can teach you.
[501:08.34]What is the over-under with 5,000 people watching?
[501:13.18]earlier today that there was at least one baker that was in the chat it's probably pretty high there's probably one of each profession just sitting in the chat five average is about the streams usually average somewhere more like four forty five hundred like five thousand people six thousand sometimes one of those four or five thousand people has to be a baker one of them has to be a doctor
[501:40.55]One of them is a president here.
[501:44.98]Astronauts?
[501:46.58]I'm sure there is.
[501:49.88]Would you guys... No, that's not even gonna... Why would I do that?
[501:52.50]And plus, no one would answer it accurately.
[501:53.92]If I did, like, a chat census, that would be kind of funny, but it would be all fucking wrong.
[502:07.33]Uh, Niall Orian, thanks for the 300 bits.
[502:09.06]The bread apology sucked.
[502:10.24]The guy with bad bread died because of you.
[502:22.39]I forgot about this.
[502:25.29]Uh, he got, alright.
[502:26.87]Every time a stream is more than 8 hours.
[502:30.26]It's like three or four separate streams in my brain.
[502:33.64]I completely forgot about the whole bread thing in the apology videos.
[502:38.80]That may as well have been two days ago for me.
[502:52.36]That was like six hours ago.
[502:54.24]You're talking about in internet years.
[502:56.56]It was like two days ago.
[502:59.55]But yeah, thank you for the 300 bits.
[503:02.87]I hope my apology was sufficient.
[503:05.15]Uh, cherry milk, thanks for the $6, 600 bits.
[503:10.07]Hey, Jeremy Wormy, I just want to say thank you for always making me laugh until my stomach hurts.
[503:13.94]Speaking of stomachs, please tell me what I should eat for lunch tomorrow.
[503:18.16]A turkey, a turkey and avocado, uh, club sandwich.
[503:24.78]Ooh, that sounds really good right now.
[503:26.32]I wonder if I can get that at Hash House A Go Go at the link.
[503:36.41]Is this a Zoomer sandwich?
[503:37.52]No, it's not.
[503:37.88]I've been eating that since I was, like, fucking 15.
[503:41.36]Come on.
[503:48.69]Uh, ZebraLord, thanks for the five subs.
[503:51.43]Avocado is gross?
[503:52.57]Well, when you put it on stuff, or you mash it up and spread it on bread, you don't even know it's there, and it's really good for you.
[503:57.37]I only really eat avocado when it's on a turkey sandwich.
[504:00.74]I don't eat it anywhere else, unless it's a guacamole.
[504:03.60]So, I don't... It's just good for you.
[504:06.42]It's really good for you, and you spread it on stuff, and it adds a little bit.
[504:10.33]I only eat it in guacamole or in turkey sandwich.
[504:17.55]I actually can't eat an avocado just out of the shell.
[504:21.47]Just open it, cut it in half, pit it, pull the center out, and eat it.
[504:25.33]It's kind of mushy and too heavy and oily for me, kind of.
[504:29.88]I don't like it.
[504:31.91]I like it when it's in other stuff, but not by itself.
[504:37.68]You wash your hands before and after eating an avocado?
[504:41.12]An avocado is not my dick.
[504:45.60]How clear do I have to make this to everybody?
[504:47.39]I don't understand.
[504:52.91]Why does this have to be such a point of contention?
[505:02.81]Fuck.
[505:04.35]Oathorse, thanks for the 300 bits.
[505:05.71]Thank you, Oathorse.
[505:08.89]Socomimus, thanks for the 250.
[505:11.05]Is that back brace for your... It's for costochondritis, but thanks.
[505:16.42]I appreciate it.
[505:18.24]Mr. Him, thanks for the 500 bits.
[505:19.46]Money for sleeping.
[505:20.84]Money for the sleeping while sick advice.
[505:22.76]Thank you, Jerma.
[505:24.78]Yeah, just add a few pillows.
[505:27.72]Drink some water.
[505:28.78]Take a little bit of NyQuil.
[505:29.80]Not too much.
[505:31.44]Should be good in a few days.
[505:36.63]Uh, thank you, Mr. Him for the thousand bits.
[505:38.71]Don't worry, Jerma, I'll never abandon you for Vinny's stream.
[505:42.69]Yeah, I appreciate that.
[505:44.09]But if, you know, it isn't more than... Look, listen to me.
[505:47.68]Let me tell you something.
[505:49.04]If you were to be on... If you were to watch TV right now, right?
[505:51.14]You would just sit down, and I gave you the remote.
[505:54.72]And I said, I'll be back in a couple hours.
[505:56.62]Just put on whatever you want.
[505:59.16]You're cycling.
[506:00.96]You'll watch something, you'll change the channel, you'll move... Like, people move around when they watch TV.
[506:04.64]It's the same deal.
[506:08.36]People move around.
[506:08.98]How many people are streaming right now?
[506:13.30]Like, 700,000 people.
[506:14.58]That's a lot of TV channels.
[506:16.62]What the hell is a TV?
[506:27.66]Oh, sorry, your monitor.
[506:28.62]Your monitor.
[506:29.42]Or your iPad screen.
[506:30.74]Or your iPhone screen.
[506:35.56]Oh, no.
[506:36.54]I...
[506:39.33]It's alright.
[506:39.79]It's all good.
[506:40.29]Don't worry.
[506:40.85]Thanks for the 1,000 bits, though.
[506:42.05]Appreciate it.
[506:45.17]Vincessity.
[506:46.50]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[506:47.26]What are you guys doing?
[506:54.64]Why are you guys adding each other and putting this?
[506:56.86]Before and after eating an avocado?
[507:00.52]You wash your hands before and after eating an avocado?
[507:03.97]An avocado is not my dick.
[507:07.15]It's not.
[507:07.67]That's good.
[507:08.13]It's true.
[507:09.86]What's wrong with that?
[507:12.30]Oh no, we're gonna do the credits now.
[507:16.50]Time for the credits!
[507:17.10]I mean, all that clip is, is me just saying a factual statement.
[507:28.66]There's nothing else on that.
[507:30.14]It's just, I just told you a factual statement.
[507:37.04]Let's change the scenes here, run the credits.
[507:38.90]Thanks a lot, everybody, for subbing.
[507:41.72]All you new subs, all you old subs, and everybody in between.
[507:46.93]Thank you.
[507:48.53]Roll.
[507:51.83]A lot of you have decided to give this stream $5 a month every month.
[507:55.03]Some of you for more than five years in a row.
[507:58.39]Which is fucking insane.
[508:00.37]I can't believe that people pay this channel and continue to stay here.
[508:04.75]Especially for that long, or if you just saw it for the first time?
[508:07.47]Thanks.
[508:09.19]You used Twitch Prime?
[508:10.19]Then fucking hell yeah.
[508:11.05]Thank you.
[508:11.91]You could give that to 700,000 other streamers, and you decided to give it to this one.
[508:16.98]Thank you.
[508:20.88]We also had a couple more bits come in.
[508:24.10]We had another one from Bitslave!
[508:26.84]250 from Bitslave.
[508:27.72]I hope you get better.
[508:28.95]Don't overexert yourself.
[508:30.79]The more you push your body through its disabilities, the worse your outcome will be.
[508:35.42]Have your girlfriend give you massages and sexy hot baths.
[508:39.00]Relax.
[508:40.57]Don't go to the Vegas Strip.
[508:41.73]Instead, strip in your home.
[508:43.75]I'm just kidding, fellow gamer.
[508:45.89]Take this time to chill and be careful.
[508:47.53]No bad intentions to you or your girlfriend.
[508:49.81]Thank you.
[508:51.51]Thank you, Bitslave.
[508:54.36]I look forward to you getting your League of Legends account back.
[509:00.66]I'm good.
[509:01.64]I'm good.
[509:03.20]Don't worry.
[509:08.38]Drunk donation?
[509:11.38]Maybe.
[509:12.24]Hey, Trilled.
[509:13.42]Hey, Trilled Chaos.
[509:15.84]Thanks for the 1111 bits.
[509:20.98]$11.11.
[509:21.02]Thank you.
[509:25.84]Thanks a lot.
[509:27.79]They say thanks, buddy.
[509:28.95]Thank you.
[509:33.17]Bitslave again.
[509:33.77]We have $2.50 from Bitslave.
[509:35.07]Here it is.
[509:36.52]I donate to you because I can afford it.
[509:38.42]And I want you to be financially stable.
[509:40.10]I can live off the money I earn and donate to you.
[509:42.84]Funny enough, you pay my salary through taxes.
[509:45.88]And I think of it as me paying you back for doing harder and more intense work than I do.
[509:50.45]I'm not so sure about that.
[509:54.35]Hope you understand you mean to the thousands of viewers you stream to.
[509:56.47]You're a legend.
[509:57.17]A league of legends.
[510:06.26]It's still on the brain.
[510:07.28]Hey, guys, he just got banned.
[510:09.20]Come on.
[510:11.23]Ugh.
[510:13.87]I just like having fun.
[510:14.91]And if you like having fun, too, and you think that this was fun, and you think this stream is fun, then we can have fun here together.
[510:20.43]That's it.
[510:21.73]That's pretty much all.
[510:22.77]That's it.
[510:26.27]Thanks for the support.
[510:28.03]Thank you for the 250 bits, Slave.
[510:29.57]Thanks.
[510:32.69]FrozenThor, thanks for the 500 bits.
[510:37.90]Jerma, a funny thing happened the other week.
[510:39.14]I was tuning into a small artist's art stream, and I used your sub emotes in her chat.
[510:45.13]And out of the five total viewers, three of them were Jerma fans who have recognized the emote.
[510:55.13]That would be pretty confusing.
[511:26.27]Man jokes about having an avocado for a penis and makes $10,000 a month.
[511:30.47]Federal agents hate him.
[511:47.90]I will tell you though, alright.
[511:49.84]If you're watching another stream, and you're enjoying somebody else's stream, make sure that when you're in that stream, that if you're there for that person, that you've given them the attention, too.
[512:00.15]You know what I mean?
[512:01.01]Make sure you're giving them attention.
[512:02.95]Not just talking about Jerma streams.
[512:04.65]You know, you want to support that person, too.
[512:06.81]Support them first.
[512:23.68]Like when you raided Joel.
[512:25.24]Wait, what?
[512:28.45]We haven't done that yet.
[512:31.79]He's pretending to be humble so we don't notice he's a millionaire.
[512:35.89]But you can't... Wait, you can't be both?
[512:40.29]Wait, how is me pretending to be humble to not... Have you not noticed that I'm a millionaire?
[512:48.24]I'm not a fucking millionaire.
[512:54.84]I'm not a goddamn millionaire!
[513:02.69]You can't be humble AND a millionaire.
[513:08.77]Oh yeah?
[513:09.60]We'll see!
[513:10.72]We'll see!
[513:14.66]We'll see!
[513:15.22]We'll see!
[513:25.73]You wouldn't be a millionaire for long.
[513:33.09]No, I probably wouldn't and whatever.
[513:35.53]Alright, I'm getting off this topic I'm the king.
[513:41.89]I'm humble.
[513:42.95]Don't ever say it's not me that's humble.
[513:44.71]It's me that's humble How dare you say otherwise do you know who the fuck you're talking to I
[514:02.01]FTK, when?
[514:02.69]Good question.
[514:04.97]I actually have to talk to those developers.
[514:07.17]It's getting close, though.
[514:12.08]Was this the super stream?
[514:14.48]Um... No, I mean, it's gonna be about the same time as yesterday's.
[514:21.36]I wanted to do two longer streams because I knew I was gonna be doing physical therapy.
[514:27.93]So...
[514:30.62]only two days in a row I'd like to do I'd like to do three days in a row before I take any time off or take like a day or two you know what I mean I like to do three I can't accidentally hit enter and fucked up the last we'll get there in a sec
[514:52.83]Anyways, thank you Archive for the 500 bits.
[514:54.95]I don't smoke.
[514:55.31]Why are you writing this?
[514:55.98]It's strange.
[514:56.32]You sure sound like it.
[514:57.02]I sound like I smoke?
[515:21.75]No, do I?
[515:22.83]No, I don't.
[515:24.81]You sure do sound like it.
[515:26.05]No, I'm going to think about that all day.
[515:31.66]You sound like you roll your own cigarettes.
[515:35.88]I've smoked a cigarette one time in my whole life and it was to try to do an audition.
[515:41.06]I told you that already.
[515:44.60]You guys already know about the cigarette commercial audition I did.
[515:46.87]Remember?
[515:49.41]Remember?
[515:50.70]Yes.
[515:50.90]Some of you do.
[515:54.14]And that's it.
[515:55.86]We got one more from Edmund Akari.
[515:58.84]They say the 500 bits, $5.
[516:01.16]They say what?
[516:02.69]And apparently they screwed it up.
[516:04.93]I wonder what the rest of that message went.
[516:08.91]Thanks for the 500 bits, Edmund.
[516:10.39]Appreciate it.
[516:15.12]Good night.
[516:15.98]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[516:16.90]I will see you on Wednesday to be more precise and exact.
[516:21.94]Wednesday afternoon.
[516:23.58]You know the time.
[516:24.84]You know the day.
[516:26.68]We're going to raid Joel.
[516:27.92]Because I haven't said hello to Joel in a few weeks.
[516:32.22]A couple weeks at least.
[516:34.42]Hope you had fun.
[516:35.52]I'll see you soon.
[516:38.62]Good night.
[516:41.28]And goodbye.
[516:50.53]you
[517:25.38]Thank you.
