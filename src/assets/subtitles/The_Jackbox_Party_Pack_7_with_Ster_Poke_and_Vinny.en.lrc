[ve:61.1.100]

[00:01.28]um Ster I will decide with an iron fist I'm flying out to you and we're gonna eat street meat and that's it I just bought the ticket I'll see you in like six hours I understand but I invited Jerma wait what happened you're leaving never never mind no I'm staying apparently I have to refund this we're playing the finals no no no no you have to no you have to play more I posted another code until you cannot refund it any further
[00:32.82]But we're right close at the window.
[00:36.08]We've only played in an hour.
[00:38.35]Wait, we're actually going again?
[00:39.27]No.
[00:42.11]I'm just... I'm curious to see what's different.
[00:45.22]Dude, that was a deadlock code.
[00:46.18]Is there a different mode?
[00:49.12]I don't think there's a different code.
[00:50.09]There's an ore merchant, and I don't know what that means.
[00:53.11]I don't see anyone new.
[00:58.32]It's just a new hole.
[01:00.95]Yeah, we make a new hole in the same spot.
[01:05.30]Vinny, we should just teach him how to glitch on Skate.
[01:08.88]I wouldn't be opposed to playing Skate.
[01:11.20]Yeah, I love it.
[01:14.44]I enjoyed the glitches.
[01:15.07]Are you going to play more?
[01:15.87]Of this?
[01:18.83]Of Skate.
[01:20.85]I might.
[01:21.67]I would play tomorrow.
[01:22.97]I feel like that game is going to be last.
[01:24.84]It's going to last.
[01:26.32]I like it.
[01:27.16]It could.
[01:27.68]I mean, they're going to turn it into like a shop thing.
[01:30.13]Yeah, exactly.
[01:30.93]A platform, like a Fortnite thing.
[01:32.95]Imagine the events they'll have.
[01:35.55]Collaborations will make people play it and shit, for sure.
[01:38.72]I think it's a decent idea.
[01:41.90]If they do collabs and they keep adding new shit up, and it's like the barrier of entry is not real money, and then you can just optionally buy shit, like skins and stuff, that's cool.
[01:54.06]It's fun.
[01:55.88]I haven't felt like putting any money into it, and it's still free, so I like it.
[01:59.93]Yeah.
[02:01.83]I played Skate 3.
[02:03.03]You might remember this, Poke, if you used to watch me.
[02:05.06]Did you ever see my Skate 3 shit from back in the day?
[02:09.00]I don't think I saw your shit, but I know that it's all about glitching.
[02:11.98]Okay.
[02:12.57]Yeah, that was like... I didn't even like the game.
[02:14.59]I can imagine what you did.
[02:15.65]You didn't even do the fucking skating.
[02:18.21]Yeah, I didn't even know how to play it.
[02:19.47]I just glitched it with guidance, and it was amazing.
[02:24.06]You know the glitch where right before you get on the board, you just fly?
[02:26.95]But not the one where your hands go up.
[02:29.11]Oh, no.
[02:30.71]Yeah, I found a new one that goes... I went a hundred million miles... I don't know what it was.
[02:37.71]I think I broke a record yesterday.
[02:39.12]Oh, I saw the clip.
[02:43.12]There was a clip of you just going directly into the sky, right?
[02:48.37]Yeah, you broke the world record, I think.
[02:51.13]I hope so.
[02:54.03]Guys, there's nothing left to do in this game.
[02:57.05]I'm just looking at a rock dick.
[03:06.91]What do you mean there's nothing left to do in the game where all you do is dig down?
[03:11.23]I'm surprised too.
[03:12.25]I have a proposed idea.
[03:13.43]I don't know how it works, but a while ago I said we play Minecraft, like just normal.
[03:21.36]We try to beat Minecraft normally, but we get a bunch of horror mods that we have no idea that are in the game.
[03:29.69]I had a horror mod picked out for Minecraft I was going to play with.
[03:32.94]I could try and figure that out again.
[03:36.15]is the the parasite mod looked cool you gotta survive and the world gets bad I'm down to play that I'll be down wait you shouldn't even do it but we can't I feel like a real game we should not be any we can't be aware of any of the mods you know what I'm saying someone's gonna have to be aware we get a mod to do it a mod for the mods yeah
[04:00.18]you wanted all your viewers to play uh the grocery store game you want your viewers to do this where does it end I think it's a I think it'd be a good idea that we go into Minecraft not knowing what the could happen together I'm back I think that's some well I mean if I if I install the mod I don't stream a lot about it and I just would not I I we we wouldn't know alright you guys wait on Minecraft
[04:24.09]Yeah, like doing a normal Minecraft playthrough, but we have a mod pack that we're not aware of what the fuck is in the game.
[04:31.74]And it's just horror.
[04:33.30]Like the weirdest horror mods.
[04:35.51]Yeah, that's fun.
[04:36.91]I would do it.
[04:39.19]This game has nothing left.
[04:41.24]There's nothing left to do in this game.
[04:43.10]It's all, we're done.
[04:45.26]We're done.
[04:46.38]Music trivia game?
[04:48.77]Music night!
[04:50.37]What was that game?
[04:52.09]Jackbox?
[04:53.05]We could do Jackbox.
[04:54.31]We could do Ninja Turtles Arcade with four people.
[04:58.20]We could do... Those are pretty much the options we have.
[05:02.68]We could fuck around in Skate and Glitch.
[05:05.69]Yeah, I was told about this game.
[05:08.43]It's a skate game?
[05:12.58]Vinny, you could explain it better.
[05:14.40]I could explain it better, but I'm down for either of those games, honestly.
[05:17.87]I'm down for anything first, too.
[05:18.91]Yeah, I don't want to...
[05:20.59]force you to download some shit.
[05:23.61]Jackbox.
[05:24.92]The chat is spamming Jackbox.
[05:26.30]Yeah, but Jackbox is one of those just, the second somebody hears it, they go, it's like rabid.
[05:31.39]They want to see it.
[05:32.93]Which one?
[05:33.57]So you don't want to do it because people want to see it?
[05:35.81]My chat would enjoy that too.
[05:36.59]Oh, let's play fucking Dig a Hole 2.
[05:40.14]Don't act like you didn't have fun playing Dig a Hole.
[05:42.18]What's the best Jackbox?
[05:43.99]Nobody is saying Dig a Hole.
[05:45.23]Let's do that.
[05:47.00]Check out the hole I dug.
[05:49.90]Guys, look, I dug a cool hole.
[05:51.69]I ulted for it, I'm so sorry.
[05:53.29]Alright.
[05:55.05]They come up with a new Jackbox.
[05:56.13]Jackbox is turning into, like, Madden.
[05:57.88]There's a new Jackbox every year, it seems.
[05:59.48]Like, which one are we doing?
[06:01.04]There's Jackbox.
[06:02.24]There's 11?
[06:02.90]There's a lot of them.
[06:04.77]There's the, like, nude one?
[06:06.79]Wait, there's a Jackbox naughty pack.
[06:08.63]You said there's a Jackbox nudity one?
[06:10.40]What do you mean nudity?
[06:12.36]naughty pack okay jackbox 11 is coming out at the end of the year so jackbox 10 was the last one then it was that word one uh jackbox 10 that does not have great reviews it seems like people don't like this one I feel like a couple years ago maybe they got way too dink how much thinking do I gotta do you know I don't know let's get a poll up um like one through ten can you do ten things in a poll
[06:43.58]I own the Jackbox Party Pack.
[06:47.79]That is the first one, isn't it?
[06:49.97]Yeah, dude.
[06:50.45]Let's bring it back.
[06:51.43]People saying 7 or 9 are the good ones.
[06:55.44]What's a 9?
[06:58.56]Jackbox 7 has talking points.
[07:00.26]I don't know what that means, but that could be fun.
[07:03.39]My chat is saying 7 is the one.
[07:06.23]I have 4 hours of 7.
[07:07.35]It could be.
[07:08.91]Is 7 the one to do?
[07:13.26]Oh yeah, 5 has the wrapping one.
[07:15.01]7 is good.
[07:16.93]I'm seeing a lot of 7s now.
[07:19.97]I think 7 is the one that we played last.
[07:23.17]Is it?
[07:24.59]It may be.
[07:25.35]Well, alright, let's do 7 then.
[07:28.34]Okay.
[07:31.50]Dude, they're charging $198 for this?
[07:35.28]For the decade bundle?
[07:36.66]They made 10 years of this.
[07:39.39]You're a flash game.
[07:44.68]Golfing is always goaded to golfing.
[07:47.51]I don't know about you guys, but mini golf goes hard next time.
[07:52.24]Did you play the VR mini golf game?
[07:55.77]Is it like the walkabout?
[07:57.71]Yeah.
[07:58.94]Yeah, I think I did it one time.
[07:59.96]It's actually not bad, right?
[08:01.37]It's pretty good.
[08:02.19]Yeah.
[08:02.76]Dude, I think it'd be funny if we all do the VR one day.
[08:06.12]That's the real unction.
[08:08.16]Yeah.
[08:08.30]VR is still.
[08:09.23]By the way, still need two plans for the unction live.
[08:17.58]Oh, I had a good one.
[08:18.84]Yeah.
[08:20.38]I had a good one.
[08:22.17]We're just gaming.
[08:23.37]Should I say it here or no?
[08:25.19]Yeah.
[08:25.55]I mean, we're just, people can hear it.
[08:28.92]Like we're just gaming.
[08:31.36]And then, like, a parent comes in the room and yells at us.
[08:34.91]Like, every five minutes.
[08:37.89]And then we need to, like, pretend to go back to bed?
[08:39.69]Do we need to, like, pretend to sleep?
[08:41.80]Not bed.
[08:45.67]Jerma loves hiring parents.
[08:47.35]How many times have you done it?
[08:51.90]Every parent will be different every five minutes.
[08:55.21]Alright, this might be loud.
[08:56.25]Turn your shit down, because who knows?
[08:58.23]We're going back like five years or so.
[08:59.79]This is probably going to be like, hey, it's Jackbug!
[09:01.80]It's going to be loud as hell.
[09:03.56]Is it seven?
[09:04.20]So we're doing seven?
[09:05.52]Yeah.
[09:06.90]Six, seven?
[09:07.46]Alright.
[09:07.94]Seven.
[09:09.57]Alright, confirmed.
[09:10.39]I'm buying it.
[09:16.20]I knew it.
[09:16.68]It's bad.
[09:17.24]It's bad.
[09:17.58]It's bad.
[09:18.38]It's real bad.
[09:18.84]I'm so glad I turned it down.
[09:22.14]Not the gunshot.
[09:23.04]It's real bad.
[09:24.40]It's not as bad as the gunshot last time.
[09:26.44]Not everyone needs to buy it.
[09:27.78]Oh, fuck.
[09:28.29]Oh, never mind.
[09:28.91]Okay, even when you get into the game.
[09:29.91]Oh, yeah, that's true.
[09:30.75]Only one person needs it, right?
[09:32.07]Because then everyone knows the website.
[09:34.83]Oh.
[09:35.05]Great.
[09:37.46]Ow.
[09:40.68]Oh.
[09:40.86]Yeah, that's... Okay.
[09:43.28]Okay.
[09:43.44]This is turning me on, so, like, stop.
[09:45.79]Fuck.
[09:46.69]Okay, be careful.
[09:47.49]This was... That was one of the worst... That was bad.
[09:50.15]That was really, really bad.
[09:51.69]Which one is loud?
[09:54.27]It says, like, cartoon clown sound effects at you.
[09:57.25]It does, like, little explosions.
[09:58.71]It's awful, dude.
[09:59.73]Terrible.
[10:05.40]How come, yeah, we can't hear it?
[10:06.98]I'm so glad you can't.
[10:08.08]I turned it off specifically to make sure of that.
[10:11.39]I just took the damage.
[10:12.23]I tanked it.
[10:18.80]You should be able to hear it now.
[10:25.74]Yeah, you hear that?
[10:28.68]That's like a tenth of what it was five seconds ago.
[10:34.23]Ah, shit.
[10:35.91]Yeah, so only one of us needs to have it.
[10:38.54]Oh.
[10:39.58]Okay, well, I'm in the menu.
[10:41.16]I feel like you'd hate concerts.
[10:45.43]This guy's never been to a concert.
[10:47.03]Ah, shitty sound effects!
[10:52.76]Oh wait, can we do one in a browser or do we have to have a phone?
[10:55.28]Like, can I have just a second browser?
[10:57.92]Oh, there should be a browser link that it gives.
[11:00.01]Yeah, I would imagine browser.
[11:02.37]Alright, so we got... Browser!
[11:05.25]So how do we do this?
[11:05.79]I need to start a... Are we doing Quiplash?
[11:08.36]What do we got?
[11:10.14]You were saying Talking Points is good, what is that?
[11:11.94]Talking Points, and then I'm sure we could do a bunch of other crap too.
[11:17.97]Jackbox, Talking Points, what is the cutest console?
[11:22.27]Jerma needs to share his screen on Discord?
[11:25.36]Really?
[11:26.14]What?
[11:26.58]I don't.
[11:28.70]Okay.
[11:29.36]Let me turn my shit back on.
[11:30.32]Keep saying all of your audio.
[11:31.48]Yeah.
[11:31.93]No one can hear us and they're mad at you.
[11:33.81]I freaked out because it was so loud.
[11:35.43]Hold on.
[11:37.59]That's what you sound like.
[11:39.20]Why is there no Jackbox on Twitch as a category?
[11:43.36]There's Jackbox Party Packs as a collective category.
[11:49.30]Oh, alright, I'll just do that then.
[11:51.49]That's fine.
[11:52.17]Alright, so... How do we set this up?
[11:54.35]We've got Quiplash, we've got the devils, and the details.
[11:56.43]Do you want to do talking points?
[11:58.45]Alright, well, I just clicked it, so... Okay.
[12:01.36]Well, I'm going to have to have a room code, aren't I?
[12:04.56]Be the alpha.
[12:05.50]Alright, I'm going to get a room code.
[12:06.50]I'll give it to you guys.
[12:08.45]You guys need to get in first, then we lock in, then we open it up to the audience, right?
[12:12.09]If he doesn't share your screen, you have nothing to show on screen.
[12:16.17]That doesn't make sense.
[12:18.01]I can just show the thing that happens on the screen.
[12:21.31]Wait, so wait, you guys actually Yeah, I think that may be right.
[12:25.82]Why is this taking so long to load?
[12:34.13]I'm stuck on a loading screen.
[12:35.83]It's literally just a text entry box.
[12:41.15]This is my game messed up.
[12:42.42]What's going on?
[12:45.43]Why is it called not safe for work?
[12:47.27]Wouldn't it be better for not safe for family?
[12:51.68]Host screen is pretty much needed.
[12:53.16]The participant screen is a nothing burger.
[12:55.04]I can stream his stream.
[12:56.83]I can do a Discord share.
[12:58.87]I just need to... Who gives a fuck about work?
[13:04.76]It's actually a good point.
[13:07.76]The worst problem is I'm stuck at a loading screen.
[13:12.55]I don't know if I'm connected to it.
[13:15.87]Hold on.
[13:16.77]Let me exit and restart again.
[13:21.14]Here it says family friendly.
[13:22.30]Why not say work friendly if we're going to go that far?
[13:24.74]Like stick to one.
[13:28.13]Work.
[13:29.67]Yeah, well, it should be not safe.
[13:31.07]Yeah, not safe for anybody or something, right?
[13:36.50]Let's try it again.
[13:37.04]Alright, start.
[13:40.24]Loading.
[13:40.70]Talking points.
[13:48.97]What's going on?
[13:51.59]I don't know.
[13:52.09]Maybe we're failures.
[13:54.35]For some reason, I can't open this.
[14:00.52]Does anybody else have 7?
[14:02.37]And can they, like, open it?
[14:07.44]I'm on keep digging.
[14:10.18]Yeah, I mean, poker's still digging.
[14:13.79]We should be just chatting.
[14:14.67]What's the difference?
[14:17.05]This is my VPN is fucking it up.
[14:21.59]Do one of you have it?
[14:24.96]What?
[14:25.22]What are we doing?
[14:26.30]Do one of you have seven?
[14:29.27]Yes.
[14:30.69]And somebody else hosted because I'm a VPN Andy.
[14:35.20]I can do it, I guess.
[14:37.89]I never had these problems before.
[14:39.21]What the fuck?
[14:39.99]I guess I'll be the alpha.
[14:41.61]Let me turn it down so I don't go... Turn your VPN off?
[14:44.27]Well, if I turn my VPN off, it's going to crash my stream.
[14:46.79]It's going to turn my stream off.
[14:52.92]Who's doing it?
[14:54.34]I'm doing it.
[14:55.62]Okay.
[14:58.97]Alright.
[14:59.51]I'm coming.
[15:01.17]Oh, it's only one of us need to even play the game.
[15:05.14]Yeah, the VPN being on is... It always helped me with routing my traffic better.
[15:11.31]You really missed out on some money in this game, huh?
[15:14.23]I don't use it every single time.
[15:15.53]I use it like most of the time.
[15:17.21]I'm back, kind of.
[15:18.01]I'm going to be making cookies.
[15:19.31]I'm waiting for the oven to heat up.
[15:21.12]Oh my god, dude.
[15:24.18]Are you serious?
[15:25.86]Yeah.
[15:28.32]Who up routing their traffic?
[15:31.31]What are we doing?
[15:33.15]Only one of us needs to play the game.
[15:35.27]So I'm doing it now.
[15:37.54]And we need you to share your screen, I guess.
[15:45.16]Alright.
[15:45.34]If you are so inclined.
[15:47.76]Wait, whose screen gets shared?
[15:50.27]The person that is running and hosting the game.
[15:54.45]Okay, who's that gonna be?
[15:56.11]Me.
[15:57.09]Dude, keep up.
[15:58.01]Let's go, Star!
[15:59.12]He's fucking champion.
[15:59.94]I was gone for a minute.
[16:00.70]I was pressing the oven button.
[16:03.46]Is this pre-made dough?
[16:04.76]Yeah.
[16:08.34]Do you think I'm making cookies from scratch?
[16:09.91]You saw what happened to my cinnamon rolls.
[16:17.22]Um... It's jackbox.TV.
[16:21.28]Go to jackbox.TV and enter the room code.
[16:28.07]You're not sharing the game.
[16:30.85]Yeah, not with you.
[16:31.46]I'm doing it with them.
[16:33.85]okay okay here I come dude I want to make cookies you I know I know I know password uh there is no put it in the Discord um room not found bro it says room found but it needs a password required oh yeah see

[17:11.61]Yeah, hold on.
[17:12.76]Do I have to say everything three times?
[17:15.42]Hey, how do I do this?
[17:24.27]Gate would have been good too.
[17:26.30]Everybody hold.
[17:27.44]I'll be back in 10 seconds.

[24:46.33]also you can draw and type on slides these slides will be picked in real time by the assistant alright you gotta help me out here always be busy wait do I have to be on my phone for this
[24:57.72]On the browser.
[24:59.00]You can probably do it in both.
[25:01.51]If you don't think the setup text fits the direction of speech, tap it forward or back to get new options.
[25:08.19]You're doing a fake presentation with slides that somebody else is making.
[25:11.48]Quick personal intro.
[25:13.04]Speech title.

[25:17.87]Text segue.
[25:19.07]Picture.
[25:20.21]Who picked this?
[25:21.13]The things we wrote are the titles of the talk.
[25:23.17]This is a lot.
[25:24.47]This is a lot.
[25:25.09]Points aren't just based on value.
[25:26.90]We're doing a Ted Talk basically.
[25:28.72]It's just as important.
[25:30.30]Alright, here we go.
[25:32.33]It'll be over before you know it.
[25:34.67]Assistant, go ahead and start picking that first picture and speaker.
[25:39.70]Don't forget you're in charge of advancing the slides.
[25:42.82]So when you're ready, hit the button and the speech will begin.
[25:45.90]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[25:47.92]I'm really glad to be here.
[25:49.09]My name is Jerma and my talk today is going to be about a few different important things, but the first and most important is how I got a million friends and all I did was be old.
[25:59.73]And I'll tell you, what you do here is...
[26:08.83]Okay, so here's how I got a million friends and all I do is be old.
[26:12.52]First of all, I started streaming on Twitch.
[26:14.98]And my main audience is not people.
[26:18.45]It's animals.
[26:20.01]And the cool part about streaming to animals is they're stupid.
[26:23.39]So you can do whatever you want.
[26:24.39]You can pretty much say whatever you want.
[26:25.98]And they will watch and they'll subscribe and they'll watch ads.
[26:31.62]It's wonderful.
[26:32.26]They don't really complain about anything.
[26:34.47]And wrestling with that for a moment, then consider this.
[26:37.91]Um...
[26:39.80]Children are incredibly easy to entertain.
[26:42.56]That's why I start every single one of my streams by dangling keys in front of the webcam.
[26:46.53]I also make loud, funny sound effects.
[26:49.55]And my stream is always in the morning at breakfast time.
[26:52.51]So I hit the beaver community.
[26:54.78]I hit all the different age brackets for all the little kids.
[26:59.06]I hit pretty much those are my two main demographics.
[27:00.88]And we always talk about food.
[27:02.20]I'm a food broadcaster.
[27:04.17]And I'm telling you, I'm getting sick and tired of something about what I've been talking about.
[27:08.40]It is very easy, like I said, but there is a struggle.
[27:15.29]The issue for me with this demographic is I don't get enough presents.
[27:20.93]They don't really have a whole lot of money.
[27:22.27]So I kind of have to make my own presents and make my own fun.
[27:28.20]So as you see right here, I've made a bed with roses on it because I'm making a fun little romantic getaway for myself.
[27:36.41]I do this at the end of each one of my streams to make myself feel a little bit better.
[27:41.61]uh thank you for uh me going first and realizing what the game was uh hand them to 15 seconds into my presentation okay so half of your score comes from how many times people hit the buttons up down it doesn't matter and the other half comes from the peaks and the valleys +2
[28:04.53]Dude, I have one of these.
[28:05.95]Oh, that's how this works.
[28:07.15]So wait, are people using the room code to, like, vote?
[28:10.24]Yeah, they're voting.
[28:12.12]Yeah, when you do good.
[28:13.99]So wait, you guys didn't like the... You guys didn't like my... You lost us at the baby part.
[28:20.48]At the baby part?
[28:21.52]I lost you at the baby part?
[28:22.60]You didn't think that was funny?
[28:26.11]You like completely changed subjects at that point.
[28:29.17]It didn't make any sense.
[28:30.21]Well, I realized what the game was.
[28:32.70]First of all, I wasn't prepared.
[28:35.18]Second of all, I... Dude, it's hard.
[28:41.75]At the beaver part, you called us all stupid?
[28:44.85]No, I said beavers are stupid, so it's easy to entertain them.
[28:49.09]That was a good tutorial.
[28:50.90]I do like this.
[28:52.32]That was fun.
[28:56.10]uh poke you are up assisted by Vinny Vinesauce no alright what is going on everybody hello my name is poke and my talk today is how me will save us and this is a serious topic in a scary time right now you know everyone looking around trying to figure out answers who do we look to as a leader
[29:24.85]and I decided to step up and I will just you know but here's where it gets spicy I'm running out of uh
[29:39.94]is this?
[29:42.24]I'm running out of toothpaste, which is a metaphor for the toothache that we're feeling right now.
[29:51.61]Brace yourselves, everybody.
[29:52.71]Massive information dump coming in 3, 2, 1.
[29:57.70]Hey, yeah.
[29:59.34]We have been blinded by society and it's time to wake up as community.
[30:06.51]Thank you.
[30:12.02]You really pulled it together at the end there.
[30:15.74]And the voice changed, too.
[30:16.93]That was a different guy.
[30:18.93]Yeah.
[30:20.35]You got a million fucking points!
[30:21.79]Why'd you get a million points?
[30:23.23]I fucking flatlined?
[30:26.04]What happened?
[30:27.62]I died.
[30:28.10]Oh, yeah.

[31:04.23]is going to be all about why I gave up absolutely everything for ninja ice cream maker let's hear it I'm the only one in this group who doesn't own one but I don't let me tell you I used to make hamburgers and it takes a really long time you got to get the patties you have to unseal each of them you have to cook them why not just blend them up into a beautiful ice cream now where did this idea start from if we really go back to the beginning
[31:33.37]We remember how these cats used to all do yoga, right?
[31:39.02]They're getting, they're wearing, they're sweating the headbands, even though they don't, I believe they don't sweat.
[31:46.13]But the important part here is that ice cream is delicious.
[31:52.13]And I've kept this secret for a long time, but I'm finally ready to unveil.
[31:56.64]You ready guys?
[31:58.75]pizza what if we made ice cream kiwi pizza trying new flavors new ingredients fresh papa John's thank you thank you man I'm sorry I don't know I picked them down vote down vote he got the most upvotes out of all of us
[32:28.69]very professional witty comments time oh oh we gotta write something about the talk um witty comment time I don't even think it shows up like maybe at the end it does alright here we go alright let's see if I can help you that sucked
[33:01.51]Hello, my name is Vinesauce.
[33:03.77]Welcome.
[33:04.91]And my talk today is going to be something very, very interesting and very special.
[33:11.38]It's time to tear everything down and replace all of it with farts.
[33:16.05]Listen, farts are funny and you know it and I know it.
[33:20.15]It's something that takes fear and courage.
[33:25.56]And when you replace sound effects with farts, just like I did on Sunday, it is really funny and everyone has a good time.
[33:32.53]You will laugh, you will cry, and that's the thing.
[33:35.15]You can be afraid of crying, but if you have the courage to cry, you can laugh.
[33:40.74]Letting it all out, letting it all go is how you advance.
[33:45.45]It's how you let go of the things that are inside you.
[33:50.11]Let go of the fear.
[33:51.62]Is it a good thing?
[33:52.68]That's the real question.
[33:55.60]And the answer is yes, but it might not be.
[34:01.20]Sometimes you feel like you're a hot dog and spaghetti slithering around in a slimy spaghetti world, not knowing your place.
[34:08.83]You might be happy.
[34:09.61]You might be sad, but that's where the fear and courage comes in.
[34:13.20]And if you let it all out, just like the hot dogs and the spaghetti passing through you, you're going to feel really good.
[34:21.41]This is my promise to you.
[34:27.84]is that farts are going to be traumatizing at first, but then you learn to live with them and they will entertain those around you, as you can see by this happy toddler.
[34:45.64]So don't ignore farts.
[34:49.13]I kind of screwed you there, Vinny.
[34:50.81]That last one, I was like, what is he going to do with this last one?
[34:54.80]Who's not upvoting in the bottom right?
[34:57.36]Here's the grip.
[34:58.40]holy fuck oh damn minnie that was that's I think that's the winner did my best yeah you got the fart prompt you did get the fart I I literally this on the stream on Sunday I literally had a breakdown crying because of fart sound effects that were replacing you like Mario's game music um just like this game or quick flash
[35:27.90]I'll play anything else.
[35:31.23]Yeah, there's a bunch of things to play in these packs.
[35:34.33]I liked it.
[35:35.33]Is it brave to say I liked it?
[35:37.23]It's fearful and brave.
[35:40.80]So is that the end?
[35:41.92]Is that round one or is that the end?
[35:43.34]One last bit of prep before the awards ceremony.
[35:47.51]Yeah, I don't know if I like it that much.
[35:50.33]This big award that you're going to give out needs a funny name.
[35:53.46]So go ahead and do that now.
[36:02.68]Yeah, my jokes need to work.
[36:05.02]Let's take a look back at where we've been.
[36:08.57]We don't need to take a look back.
[36:13.49]That makes a beaver sloth.
[36:15.95]Humans.
[36:18.66]Good job, two.
[36:22.14]What does that mean?
[36:23.74]Good job, two.
[36:33.49]And now, the moment of truth.
[36:36.14]I wrote LOL who but I didn't know it was for that.
[36:40.48]I just wrote that randomly.
[36:41.81]Each one of you has one last big award to bestow.
[36:46.63]And that includes the audience.
[36:59.25]It's a big decision, I guess.
[37:02.08]Yeah, I guess and now at last the very serious and important prizes Yes
[37:15.55]Fat award.

[37:50.64]I was supposed to go to Ster, but... Dude, you were standing up, ready to accept the award, and it was an upset.

[38:00.75]Alright, are we, uh... Are we backing up?
[38:03.69]Do you want to do the same one, or...?
[38:05.23]I don't care.

[40:34.99]And this, I'm going to, I'm going to, fuck, I'm going to sing this next part, so, um... Camp, camping in, in the camper, in the bus, with the car, with the car.
[40:50.75]I can't, I don't know.
[40:53.18]who's to blame your mom I'm sorry I'm being rude maybe it's the spirit of a man sipping grass with a straw through a straw I hate this um and that's why exorcisms are really important and it's something that it's really it adds a lot of spice to your life if you find like you're being haunted by bad decisions by bad diarrhea
[41:19.34]an exorcism everyone's doing it it's the new chic thing they're popping up all over the place in every part of the world go into your own local pop-up store for an exorcism amen thank you hey oh that one sucked time to check who is the assistant there

[41:57.38]It's okay.
[41:58.36]But you've got so many more awards than me.
[42:00.70]Oh my god, I couldn't figure that out.
[42:02.79]How the fuck face himself?
[42:04.91]There we go.
[42:05.49]Hey, welcome everybody.
[42:08.18]The, by the way, voted biggest fuckface award.
[42:11.32]Biggest fuckface in the world.
[42:14.11]Just want to say I happily take that award.
[42:16.32]And what I've done is I've taken a lot of that money from winning that award and from all the deals that have come from that.
[42:21.25]And I want to talk to you about something very important to me.
[42:23.65]What I'm talking about is I'm going to describe the full plot of the action-packed screenplay that I've written entitled Tall Babes and Short Braves.
[42:31.66]This is based on a true story.
[42:32.70]Obviously, I'm not very tall.
[42:35.49]It opens up a wide shot, a super cinema wide shot of 2,500 by 3,500.
[42:44.54]and it's me shaving.
[42:45.93]This is a picture of me.
[42:47.39]This is still from the movie, which is interesting because it's still getting final cut here, but I shave my eyebrows off, and the whole point of this is I'm trying to see how ugly I can make myself to try to get a tall babe.
[43:01.38]And the plot is really, the whole story shifts with the entrance of this wild new character.
[43:06.67]We'll talk about the character in a second, but I just want to talk about the shaving.
[43:09.34]I give the shaving techniques.
[43:11.16]I give how I shave in the beginning.
[43:14.36]But I fight breakfast in the very beginning of the movie.
[43:17.45]What ends up happening is this character is introduced.
[43:19.23]It's supposed to be this fun side character that talks to me.
[43:22.16]It's almost like a cartoony character.
[43:25.08]And then I take an axe to the table and I literally cut it in half.
[43:28.59]And this character, it's pretty brutal, but it's a part of myself, personality-wise, that I'm severing from myself.
[43:35.59]That's the point of the movie, is I'm trying to find a tall babe, and my goofy, annoying side is really getting involved, and it's a whole thing.
[43:46.34]The final scene is going to blow your friggin' mind, and I'm very proud of it.
[43:50.31]It took a lot of money.
[43:51.01]It was about $16 million for the shot.
[43:53.29]And what we ended up doing is we took a CG pig.
[43:58.08]And this is all CG, by the way.
[43:59.18]The movie goes to CG halfway through.
[44:01.48]Because I really didn't give a fuck.
[44:03.08]I was told, don't do CG.
[44:04.41]But I said, do double CG.
[44:06.35]So what you're seeing here is a pig that was made in CG.
[44:09.09]And then we re-CG'd the pig.
[44:10.76]We remastered it.
[44:12.16]So this is a remaster of a remaster of a CG pig that ends up...
[44:18.69]Actually, I'm a little bit annoyed at the production here because what I wanted to have this last slide be was the tall babe.
[44:24.85]And I think somebody that I fired on the crew thinks it's a funny idea to not have the tall babe there, but do the pig scene.
[44:31.78]So you already got fired, so go fuck yourself.
[44:34.62]The data is coming in.
[44:36.38]You're just going to spoil the whole thing.
[44:38.89]Wow.
[44:40.25]The only other option was a child.
[44:42.23]I'm so sorry.
[44:44.97]Oh, man.
[44:46.66]Promise our life.
[44:50.73]What about Babe the Pig?
[44:52.88]Oh, shit.
[44:55.36]That's true.
[45:05.10]Now it's your turn.
[45:07.19]Alright, I won't let you down.
[45:09.51]Alright, buddy.
[45:10.60]Let him down.
[45:16.60]Okay, I'll give you this one.
[45:18.71]This is a good start.
[45:19.89]Okay, I'll talk, because I think I've rushed before.
[45:23.89]Hello, my name is Stirr, and my talk is going to be all about... I am putting those jerks at JerkCorp on notice.
[45:35.07]We all know the ones that I'm talking about.
[45:38.01]It's those freaking guys...
[45:42.24]With everybody.
[45:43.94]I think every single corporation has failed us in the modern age.
[45:47.42]I'm just gonna say it.
[45:48.36]The grocery store, you go to the grocery store, it fucking sucks.
[45:50.83]You go on a bus, it fucking sucks.
[45:53.19]Anywhere that you go nowadays, I gotta let them know with the megaphone.
[45:58.36]You might ask yourself, why?
[46:00.66]Why does everything suck?
[46:03.04]Well, it's because of all the privacy and the data that's being like, they're just watching you and they know what ticks you off and they're trying to piss you off.
[46:13.24]These jerk faces at Jerk Corp, you fucking get it.
[46:16.96]They're trying to do it.
[46:19.89]And that's why.
[46:20.65]What does this mean for you?
[46:23.60]Okay.
[46:24.18]What can we do about Jerk Corp?
[46:26.26]Think about it.
[46:28.71]we can wipe them on our ass until it's bleeding until it is dry we can use up the entire roll on them there are more of us than them we need to find the jerks and we need to flush them thank you dude you got like a mega brain wow dude yeah you got why is this thing spinning because we're all voting he's preaching truth let's tally it all up

[47:33.12]And my talk is about... Well, so.
[47:40.05]You decided to be a fuckface.
[47:41.39]Here's everything you need to know.
[47:42.95]As a professional fuckface, I'm gonna tell y'all how to be the best fuckface in the industry.
[47:48.01]This is my fuckface grandma.
[47:49.40]She's a dumbass fucking idiot.
[47:51.64]But listen.
[47:53.46]She's a good person.
[47:55.58]She's not a bad person.
[47:57.76]And she died from...
[48:01.49]She's dead.
[48:04.23]Experts are highly concerned about the way I'm acting.
[48:09.76]And here's why.
[48:12.31]A few years ago, a magician did a trick and I couldn't figure it out.
[48:16.49]And it's been pissing me the fuck off.
[48:19.44]Till this day, let me leave you with this.
[48:23.70]What is going on in the stock market?
[48:26.26]I feel like these Trojan dinosaur people are just fucking taking over.
[48:32.60]What happened to us at GameStop?
[48:34.85]What happened?
[48:35.41]They forgot about us at GameStop.
[48:36.85]Thank you.
[48:41.97]The funny thing is, I can see a total fuckface giving a presentation about a trick that he couldn't figure out.
[48:49.56]That's a perfect fuckface response.
[48:56.35]Ooh.
[48:56.81]What the hell?

[49:10.00]Oh, Jerma's always slower.
[49:11.58]That last picture I couldn't quite get.
[49:14.41]You know, I was trying to find a true line.
[49:15.75]The magician one?
[49:18.01]Yeah, not being able to figure out a trick was great.

[57:24.40]I just figured it would be blasphemous if people answered against it.
[57:30.99]What is this awful choice?
[57:35.52]That's a shock.
[57:37.84]oh my god alright I can't vote for stupid shots oh yeah you can I like that one it's a shy guy it's a not like literally I love how you just it's not the sound you described how how weak it was or how much of like a wuss it was

[68:04.37]I changed my mind again.
[68:08.70]Alright.
[68:09.74]I'm ready.
[68:11.47]Okay.
[68:14.15]Okay, don't show yet.
[68:15.01]It's Vinny.
[68:16.71]Oh, it's Vinny.
[68:18.88]Yeah, you're VIP.
[68:20.02]Everybody's in.
[68:20.84]Oh.
[68:24.55]Okay, now we can show.
[68:28.44]So this is a drawing one?
[68:30.26]Ster has cool character design.
[68:33.63]I made it.
[68:34.47]The one I fish is a good one.
[68:37.73]Wait, but Ster is an artist though.
[68:43.37]This is not fair.
[68:45.09]Wait, is this a drawing one?
[68:47.33]I think this is a drawing one.
[68:49.18]Get a tablet.
[68:49.80]Get a tablet out.
[68:50.60]Cheating.
[68:54.49]In this first step, the trainers will be prompted to draw and name a particular type of champion character.
[69:02.26]They'll be equipped with two tools, a pen for drawing and a thick marker for covering in.
[69:09.81]Once a character is drawn and named, it can be submitted.
[69:14.21]The timer's been set.
[69:16.45]Off we go.
[69:17.65]Okay.
[69:28.58]Can you change color?
[69:29.40]Oh, yeah.
[69:29.94]Okay.
[69:30.70]I don't think my tablet works unless I restart.
[69:40.99]It's not plugged in.
[69:56.37]Trying my guy.
[70:01.38]You guys are about to beat me.
[70:02.66]I haven't even started.
[70:48.23]So that's color in.
[70:49.17]40 seconds.
[70:51.05]Oh fuck, we only have 40 seconds?
[70:53.58]Mm-hmm.
[71:04.43]How do you fill in?
[71:07.57]Gotta name your guy too.
[71:10.38]Fuck!
[71:17.19]No, no, no.
[71:18.21]I don't want to do that.
[71:20.92]I wasn't ready.
[71:23.23]I'll be ready next time.
[71:31.50]I didn't get to write the whole thing Challenger Okay Oh god

[72:07.89]A challenger to the thing you just got.
[72:09.77]Ah, okay, okay.
[72:14.28]I can't draw this.
[72:15.36]The opposite to this, I can't draw this.
[72:21.95]I can't draw the opposite to this.
[72:23.15]I can't draw the opposite to this.
[73:10.45]Sounds like F-Zero music.
[73:14.25]Now it doesn't.
[73:35.50]No, I don't want to do that.
[73:36.18]It's too thick.
[73:45.10]How much time?
[73:45.88]Oh fuck, I wasn't even close.
[73:57.94]I don't know.

[82:50.90]You can't tell him no.
[82:53.08]Yeah, that just got us rigged.
[82:54.88]Sorry, that has nothing to do with anything.
[83:01.65]He has to come back story.
[83:03.93]You denied his comeback story.
[83:07.32]Oh, what the fuck?
[83:12.87]Wait, what am I looking at here?
[83:14.51]Suspect number one.

[84:29.18]Of course it would be Nerd Slug, are you serious?
[84:31.56]And he's explaining.
[84:32.78]I don't think we're playing by the rules.
[84:36.65]I'm keeping Nerd Slug in for this one.
[84:39.09]Dude.
[84:41.71]That's the thing, is...
[84:48.43]Oh, no.
[84:51.06]Look at him using his absolute power move.

[84:56.61]Oh, no.
[84:59.27]Oh, no.
[85:02.23]He was going to kill the slug with the salt.
[85:06.26]It's time for our next bout.
[85:12.13]Who is the champion of the tea party?
[85:18.88]I mean, it's gotta be the guy with all the teabags.
[85:20.98]What does Gillette have to do with this?
[85:22.98]That's bullshit.
[85:24.24]Let's shave him up.
[85:25.07]It all comes down to this next match.
[85:31.87]The champion of plotting your demise.
[85:34.84]He had eyebrows, that's why he did it.
[85:37.00]What will the trainers do?
[85:38.98]Let's see.
[85:40.30]The pen is fightier.
[85:48.48]Oh, it's too close to call.
[85:51.94]Oh, my trick.
[85:53.18]That's a... What?
[85:55.47]No way.
[85:56.09]What?
[85:58.31]Oh, yeah.
[85:59.29]They were 50-50.
[85:59.91]That's crazy.
[86:02.04]Audience says I peed myself.
[86:03.48]Who in the audience said they peed themselves?
[86:06.92]My people pissed.
[86:08.93]The judges are tallying the final scores and...
[86:17.05]It better not- Oh no!
[86:19.57]Yeah, nice arsenal of freaks you got there, buddy.
[86:24.00]And he wins the fucking game, which is outrageous, by the way.
[86:31.23]Let's go again.
[86:33.31]You wanna do the same thing?
[86:34.87]Yeah, that one wasn't real.
[86:37.67]You don't wanna do the thropper one?
[86:40.00]Old characters can tag in.
[86:41.88]Some of them we will not be seeing again.
[86:45.85]Hopefully, welcome to the Scrawls.
[86:49.06]Are we are we doing doing it again?
[86:51.18]Are about to face off.
[86:52.60]That's what they're wanted to press the button.
[86:54.50]Champion characters with unusual skills.
[86:58.33]Will the.
[86:59.57]I think you can skip as host.
[87:01.41]It's not letting me skip this.
[87:04.52]Alright.
[87:08.40]Stay on prompt, everyone.
[87:10.83]Prompt as much as possible.
[87:12.31]Okay.
[87:14.17]It's prompted up.
[87:16.46]OK, here we go.
[87:26.28]I need to try to draw this guy from memory and it's going to be interesting.
[87:56.24]There is an undo button at the top left.
[88:00.56]Yeah, but it's not a race.
[88:01.99]What if you go too far?
[88:47.25]It's time to get a little bit of time.
[88:48.55]What color is his pants?
[89:03.88]It's time to name those characters.
[89:24.32]I guess you don't get to see the prompt on the response
[90:38.03]Coloring is so hard.
[90:55.73]I got something so good for this.
[91:22.87]20 seconds remain.
[91:24.67]Players need to name their character.
[91:41.48]Oh, I forgot one detail.
[91:43.65]It's okay.
[91:44.89]Damn it.
[91:45.43]Oh, fuck.
[91:45.99]It's okay.
[91:47.01]You'll get the idea.
[91:49.11]same a little bit of a rush they should give us 30 minutes our first warrior versus is this the shyness thing I mean I I know who drew one of these
[92:15.82]What does the text on it say?
[92:18.29]I was trying to write D&D.
[92:20.71]To keep away the puss blast.
[92:22.57]Oh, blast.
[92:25.08]Somebody said it was a Borderlands gun.
[92:29.49]You've been playing a lot of Borderlands.
[92:37.08]That's insane.
[92:40.24]I don't know, this is hard.
[92:51.14]But I don't know, man.
[92:52.28]Geek bar, that's not an unk thing.
[92:55.90]That's like new age, isn't it?
[92:57.64]What is it?
[92:58.66]By the way, you can fill in the thing with the marker and it doesn't draw over your lines.
[93:04.03]Yeah.
[93:04.27]So be sure to use the marker option.
[93:07.11]I didn't have time.
[93:08.00]I was mudded.
[93:11.33]On my amp.
[93:13.61]100%.
[93:26.37]That's crazy that we both went the same way here.
[93:31.23]Well, no, it's because I saw the Flanders.
[93:34.34]Oh, you did see the Flanders.
[93:36.72]Yeah.
[93:37.46]Hey, Homer.
[93:40.81]Just to let you know, you're not going to win this battle.
[93:42.95]I don't believe what I'm seeing.
[93:44.99]Oh, I win, Nettie.
[93:48.32]Flammy Sprite.
[93:49.12]Oh, horror murk.
[93:52.68]Howdy there.
[93:52.94]What makes him cry?
[93:53.68]Howdy there.
[93:54.79]I was going to make him in like a big suit, but I ran out of time.
[94:00.07]Versus.
[94:00.65]One of them will walk out as champion of sewer dwellers.
[94:11.05]By the way, the guy that Krang sits in is not supposed to be naked.
[94:14.53]I ran out of time.
[94:15.93]He's supposed to have like a red speedo.
[94:23.80]What?
[94:24.70]There's no way you can beat Turl.
[94:27.72]Turl.
[94:29.85]I wanted to fill in his shell, but I wasn't sure what color that was, and I ran out of time.
[94:33.97]It looks like he's got a face on his shell.
[94:36.17]Free-balling.
[94:37.45]Free-balling with Krang.
[94:38.91]Oh my god.
[94:47.46]Oh shit, we're making more.
[95:14.43]My game- my mouse is lagging.
[95:16.79]Am I using too much paint?
[96:28.87]I don't know oh my god name those characters is at least one chat member shaking their ass to this probably
[96:59.05]What?
[97:06.32]Oh, God.
[97:41.85]hard to do commentary and draw at the same time yeah it's just it is just kind of what it is isn't it you gotta wait for the payoff like everybody else sweet dreams are made of these I was thinking the same yeah
[98:28.58]I was handed the easiest W of my life Name those characters!
[98:58.33]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[98:59.71]Oh, shit.
[99:06.86]Man, I thought of a good name and it was too late.
[99:09.36]Go.
[99:14.35]It's the second half, which means it.
[99:16.55]Here are the next two fighters.
[99:20.25]Dirty Daryl.
[99:21.29]What the fuck is that name?
[99:22.88]I named it something different.
[99:24.84]That's supposed to be the Soapinator.
[99:28.38]No, that's Jean.
[99:29.86]What?
[99:30.87]We're watching a scribble quibble.
[99:36.84]Oh, nice Jean.

[99:42.17]I like his fingers.
[99:42.83]Champion of getting fired on Monday.
[99:45.94]It's decision time.
[99:49.08]Oh.
[99:52.95]How'd you bring it back the same way you copy-paste it what the fuck how did you do it again?
[99:59.06]You can tag in your old ones why?
[100:02.20]It happened on a Tuesday
[100:23.07]Alright, Waluigi's pretty great.
[100:31.12]These are actually both as good.
[100:36.87]That feels like a Waluigi thing.
[100:54.75]come on what do you mean I'm literally called death but that's not as strong as your horror oh because June passed I don't even know what is June it was d-day oh is it actually it's just a random day wait what oh the change of day it was d-day yeah up next
[101:27.57]great maker versus what is that oh I thought it said marker great I can't write make why what is fan man
[101:42.32]oh my god oh I have some logic here and it's really dumb what is the fan man I thought it was a marker I thought it's a great marker I was gonna like multi-level marketing what will the trainers do they're tagging out alright he's bringing in the anime gonzo I feel like I'm being pretty marketed to by gillette I don't believe but it is spelled wrong so
[102:09.91]because wind dries out like the air dries out markers I thought it was a marker nothing can stop these two holy moving on who is a champion of the walk oh no
[102:35.17]What are you talking about?
[102:37.79]All I could see was that it was shame.
[102:40.06]I tried to battle shame.
[102:42.62]You're 0 for 2 tonight.
[102:43.82]That's 0 for 2.
[102:44.56]Oh, boy.
[102:45.13]Uh-oh.
[102:45.91]It doesn't show you the prom.
[102:48.17]You really, dude?

[102:56.56]It's decision time.
[103:05.02]Sorry, sorry.
[103:09.90]This is a sponsor, right?
[103:10.94]Did I just click on Kermit?
[103:12.52]I didn't want to attack Kermit to go in.
[103:15.15]Call him back.
[103:18.79]He wins.
[103:19.69]Somehow, Ster still won.
[103:21.04]Wow, dog.
[103:25.54]Ster said, fuck it, I'm going next level.
[103:30.65]Okay, folks, that was the final match.
[103:33.05]Yeah, Ster, we gotta talk after this.
[103:34.19]Ster tallying the final scores, and... We have a winner!
[103:43.38]How do you keep winning them?
[103:44.94]That's what I don't understand.
[103:46.54]That's Daryl Pride right there.
[103:48.98]devilish daryl the point is you're supposed to guess the prompt and make something that would match it better not create a character that would defeat the other character oh wait wait what
[104:01.98]yeah but it's impossible to guess the prompt when the full screen is black and it says shame I think we just listen we expose that all of our viewers are right wing okay dude my my theory with this is just it was just like the the thought you know what I mean just that like kind of that like darkness you know what I mean that's what I was going for well it makes sense with the problems but I can't see it I wish you could see it listen we have to testify soon for Twitch
[104:30.95]Ster here, you have to testify, not us.
[104:33.83]I vote in pride before they showed the prompt.
[104:36.80]I see rainbow, I click.
[104:42.18]Hi diddly ho there.
[104:44.19]Um, do you want to do one more of a different mode?

[105:31.36]Blather round.
[105:32.38]Listen, Ster is just autistic.
[105:39.07]What can I say?
[105:40.25]That's what you should say.
[105:42.79]Wait, what'd you say?
[105:44.64]Ster's autistic.
[105:49.06]For anyone just joining, that's going to sound so out of context.
[105:52.10]It's a callback, everybody.
[105:53.10]He's calling back to when I locked in on being a cashier on two stations earlier.
[105:58.05]It's a callback.
[105:59.13]It all makes sense if you watch ours.
[106:01.42]I just leaked it.
[106:03.78]I leaked it.
[106:05.65]Did you?
[106:06.05]I leaked it, yes.
[106:06.85]Oh, you leaked the code!
[106:17.63]The hackers got in.
[106:20.91]The hackers, aka people who entered a code.
[106:24.49]Yeah, I don't know how they got it.
[106:25.83]Anyone who gets into any of our games, they're just hackers.
[106:28.29]Immediately a hacker.
[106:29.59]You're hacking.
[106:31.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[106:34.08]Oh my god, I did it.
[106:35.40]What are you doing?
[106:36.34]I might have done it.
[106:38.28]When you click re- I thought I had to do a flip up to read the room code.
[106:41.92]It literally says it out loud.
[106:45.37]Wait, really?
[106:46.59]Yeah.
[106:48.77]Before there was a similar button that would show the code.
[106:51.31]Now it is don't click that button or it reads it out loud.
[106:55.20]see I'm in I see I feel like I'm playing catch up okay Jeremy have to start it okay and away we go wait Jerma is is a nickname on Jeremy
[107:19.68]You're going to present a secret prompt, like Moby Dick.
[107:32.56]You'll describe it to everyone else with sentences like this one.
[107:35.88]Now you can change some of these words, but your options are very limited.
[107:40.25]Everyone else will be guessing while you make more elaborate sentences.
[107:48.93]oh it's a lot like free willy too your mom be fast to win big and teamwork is rewarded so talk out loud and work together yeah together I can't wait to work with you guys w-e-r-k Ster pick a prompt you're familiar with something you think you could describe we gotta get the oh yeah
[108:20.99]are worth more points oh that you should have said that before I picked one of them sir you're not allowed to do that voice for a day for a day pick words to build a sentence for a day and then tap submit when you're finished
[108:42.94]oh and you can choose more than one word in each column oh well say that say that before I click yeah I literally clicked out and now I can't do that okay chat we are choosing words we are not writing in our own words so impatient streamers that's true
[109:11.65]I haven't permanently banned that guy.
[109:14.13]Whatever.
[109:14.61]You know the routine.
[109:16.51]The category is person.
[109:18.13]Some of my favorite people are person.
[109:21.14]Oh.
[109:24.06]They're a massive positive shape.
[109:26.32]Start guessing, everyone.
[109:27.82]Use your device and type it in.
[109:29.87]That means everyone in the audience, too.
[109:33.25]In the meantime, the presenter will write another sentence.
[109:36.71]You'll know when we pick it.
[109:38.77]Godzilla.
[109:40.61]You'll know.
[109:42.77]It's not that one.
[109:43.79]Do I say that or no?
[109:46.59]I don't know.
[109:51.28]Patrick.

[110:01.63]Mothra.
[110:02.57]Zoram.
[110:06.60]Big positive...
[110:15.67]They're nothing like Godzilla.
[110:17.82]When the presenter uses your guessing sentence, you get points.
[110:25.14]She's so incredible.
[110:27.31]What a marvelous sentence.
[110:30.13]They're in massive positive shape.
[110:31.15]They're a part of the cinema.
[110:32.05]They're nothing like Godzilla.
[110:33.34]And she's so incredible.
[110:34.76]Dude, he stumped us.
[110:42.45]We're stumped.
[110:42.97]Vinny's guessing cock.
[110:47.60]He gets to go to work on Monday.
[110:49.60]How about Mother Earth, Gaia?
[111:07.20]Known for the out of this world wifey.
[111:11.51]Out of this world wifey?

[111:41.20]Am I wrong?
[111:42.38]Yeah, sure.
[111:42.96]I mean... I guess you're right.
[111:45.95]I don't know.
[111:46.53]Dude, she was awesome.
[111:57.75]I don't like Vinny's reactions, I feel like these are just wrong Nothing like dog
[112:28.23]They have the same vo- oh, okay.
[112:43.85]You've- you already said dog.
[112:50.62]A beloved dog?
[112:55.99]It's in a book about patients and they're cherished and they're a dog.
[113:01.65]Known for the optimistic, anxious, bothering.
[113:04.12]What?
[113:04.60]What dog is this?
[113:08.86]Wait.
[113:14.35]It's not Odie?
[113:16.71]The amount of sentence in that sentence is astounding.
[113:21.36]Get your guesses in before this...
[113:24.88]This is hard.
[113:26.66]Yeah.
[113:29.48]I don't know things.
[113:32.03]My fault on the Jessica Rabbit.
[113:33.45]There's no way.
[113:34.03]I thought I showed you guys the options.
[113:37.40]I'm thinking.
[113:38.48]This is tough.
[113:42.05]I have no idea.
[113:45.95]They would be friends with Torch.
[113:47.47]This was tough.
[113:48.32]This is genuinely really tough.
[113:50.98]That's hard.
[113:52.04]Did you guys put... Nope.
[113:53.90]Poke blew it.
[113:54.60]Did you click that?
[113:58.51]Optimistic, anxious, bothering.
[114:00.61]Oh, bother.
[114:01.55]That's the best I had as a clue.
[114:03.42]It's not that obvious.
[114:05.66]The category is story.
[114:08.28]I'm going to get mine because I'm so good at this.
[114:11.45]Some of my chat got it right.
[114:12.83]It's a story about a youthful being.
[114:18.81]I thought Ben Button was Bin Laden.
[114:23.96]Holy shit.
[114:25.68]What the fuck is this?
[114:31.09]Terrifying impregnating.
[114:40.50]It's not the same form as Obama.
[114:43.71]Youthful being.
[114:50.70]Bro, I have to think.
[114:52.62]This is too hard for me.
[114:54.23]Oh, God damn it.
[114:54.81]Wait, somebody got it.
[114:55.55]Oh, alien.
[114:58.59]Got him.
[115:00.50]Impregnating.
[115:02.42]Terrifying.
[115:03.32]I was focusing on the first part.
[115:05.83]Actually perfect.
[115:06.85]Terrifying and impregnating.
[115:09.15]That was great.
[115:12.50]I'm just going to hide my chat.
[115:13.80]I'm just going to hide my chat.
[115:18.14]Aliens are not the same as Obama.
[115:20.00]Alright, let's go.
[115:29.76]Bye, chat.
[115:38.37]Ugh.
[115:43.66]Yeah, let's go.
[115:47.34]Let's go.
[115:48.00]The form.
[115:49.32]Oh, that's crazy.
[115:50.43]I covered my chest.
[115:52.03]I'm naked.
[115:54.81]You can't keep it from me.
[115:56.07]I know.
[115:56.41]That's insane.
[116:01.50]Let's see how the points came out.
[116:03.14]I would have said DMV right there, too.
[116:04.45]In my opinion, you all did perfectly.
[116:07.73]But of course, the scores don't reflect that.
[116:12.22]round two just for you as a little treat I thought that was in the game syrup for real these round two prompts are juicy you lucky ducks how would anybody get this most familiar with or just close your eyes stab the screen and scream I trust the
[116:41.42]I skipped an easy one and now it's hard I yeah I feel like a sentence to describe your new problem they should just let you keep re-rolling if you really want to fine-tune tap individual words in your sentence and change them oh I got something really interesting I think it's gonna work oh mine's really bad oh mine's raunchy
[117:11.96]That's not great, but I work with it.
[117:14.61]I can work with it.
[117:15.75]I hate mine.
[117:16.57]Good luck, guys.
[117:17.15]I'm so sorry.
[117:18.31]This is gonna be a person.
[117:19.77]Delightful.
[117:20.95]I love people.

[118:47.40]Famous for the nourishment.
[118:48.20]He's frosted tips.
[118:49.10]They're nothing like Frosty the Snowman.
[118:50.66]It adds up, but why would your brain ever go there?
[118:54.02]It's weird, but it made sense.
[118:55.93]It made sense.
[118:58.49]Yeah, he's a little tangy.
[118:59.69]He's a tangy dude.
[119:03.70]A little circle thing.
