[00:01.32]I still have the Die Dallas Encounter discs scattered around my desk.
[00:07.07]Is this a rare game?
[00:07.87]Are these worth anything?
[00:11.29]Is the Die Dallas Encounter worth any money?
[00:14.13]If it's in the disk with the original packaging or anything?
[00:18.13]I mean, it might be.
[00:18.74]It's a 3DO game.
[00:20.00]Look at all these raids.
[00:25.37]Yeah, alright.
[00:26.53]It's- alright.
[00:27.31]Am I crazy to say that, like, you should have to do two-factor authentication with your phone if you're gonna do a one-viewer, one-person raid?
[00:35.52]I mean, come on, Quinn.
[00:45.22]It's like, I'm looking at my timeline of- of Streamlabs stuff, and this just, like, you guys are just breaking the system here.
[00:55.73]It's just a bunch of these one, one, well, this was two viewers.
[00:59.39]Wait a minute.
[01:01.20]You guys are just raiding me from your personal Twitch channels.
[01:05.60]You're already here.
[01:06.72]Why are you doing that?
[01:12.64]How does it, wait, hold on a minute.
[01:14.58]I have a question.
[01:17.07]If you, if you raid me from your account and you're here, are you fucking up my view count?
[01:33.26]Yeah?
[01:34.37]Well, cut it out.
[01:39.63]Inflated viewers.
[01:42.71]No, like, look, and people wonder, oh, I can't believe he missed that raid today.
[01:48.14]Wow, there was a raid that came in.
[01:49.84]Yeah, it's in the middle of like, it's like in the middle of 301 viewer raids.
[01:57.55]Imagine if I had a notification that played like...
[02:01.12]If raids came in, that's why I don't have sounds at play anymore.
[02:05.28]What an entitled streamer.
[02:11.55]No, okay.
[02:12.67]Look, if you raid this channel, I really appreciate it.
[02:15.73]But if you're in pre-stream chat raiding the channel just to get on my Streamlabs feed, that's a different story.
[02:31.05]Ungrateful, ungrateful!
[02:35.67]He hates us.
[02:36.47]Can you stop screaming?
[02:38.97]I have homework to do.
[02:42.04]But just lower your volume.
[02:47.92]Today we're going to play Bugsnax again.
[02:49.46]We might even get to the end of this game, I assume.
[02:53.35]If we don't, then we don't.
[02:56.31]But I'm playing it again.
[02:57.69]I think it's fun.
[02:58.57]I think it's cool.
[03:00.21]I think it's worth just chilling out and playing.
[03:03.69]I like it.
[03:07.41]I adjusted my seat today to make sure that I could... I'm sitting back in my chair right now.
[03:16.00]Like, almost, like, back.
[03:17.56]I moved the mic, so it was like, okay.
[03:19.77]Um, you know in Blade 2?
[03:21.95]You know that big, huge, beanbag chair, fat, vampire, alien guy?
[03:26.85]That's how we're streaming today.
[03:36.08]Oh, that's nothing.
[03:37.20]That's just research.
[03:38.84]That's just a video game, huh?
[03:41.14]Hit him with the UV light.
[03:44.02]That's what we're doing.
[03:44.62]Just don't burn me, please.
[04:01.08]Are there any essential viewing movies?
[04:03.08]What do you mean?
[04:03.66]Oh.
[04:04.94]I don't know if Blade 2 is an essential required reading movie.
[04:08.99]It's just a movie that I watched 15 years ago.
[04:15.93]That's like the... What the hell is this?
[04:18.85]I think one of the only... That's Rodney Dangerfield.
[04:28.32]You did like a- you did a face swap thing with Rodney Dangerfield.
[04:37.11]That's Rodney Dangerfield.
[04:38.37]Right?
[04:57.47]We're hooing Rodney Dangerfield?
[04:59.43]Well, I guess that makes sense considering none of you... That's not me.
[05:06.19]That is a face morphing software of me and you put Rodney Dangerfield's face on here.
[05:13.42]And it's very funny.
[05:21.70]If you play...
[05:24.11]Tongueless this stream.
[05:25.59]I'll sub for a whole year.
[05:28.32]I don't feel like I don't want to type that into Google.
[05:30.12]So no It's a real picture of you off of CBD He's been dead for 16 years kind of normal for a lot of people to have no idea who he is I
[05:50.15]Yeah, sometimes I talk to you guys as if you're not, you know, in your mid to late 30s.
[05:58.93]Oh my god, I can't believe you guys, that's Rodney Dangerfield!
[06:02.65]Like, I may as well say, like, Charlie Chaplin for a lot of you guys.
[06:11.19]I'm gonna just give 50 bucks.
[06:12.17]Yeah, but you guys don't, you, everyone knows who Charlie Chaplin is.
[06:17.31]They teach that in, like, the first grade.
[06:24.21]Uh, JPQPlays gave 5,000 bits.
[06:27.73]50 bucks right at the beginning of the stream.
[06:30.31]We haven't even done anything.
[06:31.07]You don't even know if this stream is worth $50.
[06:32.41]We haven't done anything yet.
[06:37.57]But thanks a lot, JPQ.
[06:40.00]They say, hey, Jeremy, you're my favorite streamer and extremely inspirational.
[06:43.10]Also, most of the community is awesome.
[06:46.18]I agree.
[06:47.62]Well, but the second part.
[06:48.54]Not that, like, I'm, like, you're... Well, yeah.
[06:51.72]Thank you.
[06:54.11]most of yes you can say most of because that's like going into the grocery store and at any moment in the grocery store you could be surrounded by like murderers if there's a hundred people in your grocery store five of them might be a serial killer you don't know that you can't walk you can't just scream in the in the grocery store all of you are awesome and everyone here is awesome
[07:23.03]A guy that like has four people buried.
[07:25.70]Here's you say that.
[07:26.30]He's like, oh, nice.
[07:27.62]Alright.
[07:28.70]I'm good.
[07:32.46]You can't make a statement like that.
[07:37.60]Like the dude that has his fourth salsa in his pants.
[07:41.35]Stealing from the grocery store.
[07:42.81]Here's you say that.
[07:43.87]Oh, alright.
[07:45.67]I'm in the clear.
[07:48.59]Can't make a blanket.
[07:49.27]There's no blanket statements here.
[07:50.88]Most of you.
[07:51.48]Because I don't know all of you.
[07:56.64]Spike889 just gave 5 community subs.
[07:59.00]Thanks for the subs dude.
[08:01.75]Is it chunky or smooth?
[08:02.97]What do you mean smooth salsa?
[08:05.53]Smooth salsa is just pizza sauce.
[08:18.20]It's restaurant salsa.
[08:20.44]Smooth salsa.
[08:26.83]How do you know that most of us are not serial killers?
[08:28.79]I don't know that.
[08:29.49]I have no idea who you are.
[08:32.80]Like every president of the United States could be watching this right now.
[08:36.16]I don't know.
[08:40.56]Jimmy Carter could be here right now.
[08:42.20]I don't know.
[08:42.86]It's possible.
[08:43.86]He's just on the toilet with his phone.
[08:46.65]I can't wait for Bugsnax.
[08:50.05]That's possible.
[08:51.07]I don't know.
[08:53.95]What about George Washington?
[08:56.51]Yeah, George Washington in his coffin.
[08:59.60]He had an iPad slot built into his coffin.
[09:03.76]And he could always have Jerma985 on it.
[09:06.62]On his iPad.
[09:07.76]On his coffin iPad.
[09:17.01]What a shitty afterlife.
[09:21.69]What do you mean afterlife?
[09:30.96]implied that there is no afterlife whoops sorry sorry I'm sorry I didn't what I meant to say was what I meant to say was oh no what do I do what do I do now I don't get out of here how do I how do I move away from what I just said somebody said hey Jerma do you want my paycheck no you spend your paycheck on you you want to throw me a couple of coins I will probably catch them
[10:05.95]Play the damn game.
[10:07.57]Hey, I'm just relaxing, man.
[10:08.95]I'm lying back like the zombie in Blade 2.
[10:11.95]I told you, I'm gonna relax mood today.
[10:14.83]It's gonna be so chill.
[10:19.64]Cognito Hazardous just gave $50.
[10:21.30]You guys are giving me $100 and I haven't even showed the game yet.
[10:27.16]That's 5,000 more bits.
[10:30.09]He says, Wag Baba Boo Boo.
[10:35.08]Alright.
[10:36.46]Thank you for the $50.
[10:38.03]That's based.
[10:43.49]True.

[11:02.82]Nah.
[11:05.51]Nah.
[11:06.97]No, I can't.
[11:08.71]No, not today.
[11:10.19]Streamer approves that God is a lie.
[11:17.39]Didn't say anything.
[11:20.31]Guys, we're talking for George Washington watching my stream while he's dead in his coffin.
[11:27.12]We're not talking reality here.
[11:33.80]Where do we leave off?
[11:34.46]I forget.
[11:39.27]Ew, bugs.
[11:39.93]Turn it off.
[11:40.47]Blue pilled.
[11:50.07]Okay.
[11:51.83]Stop reading chat.
[11:53.03]What?
[11:54.81]What do you mean stop reading?
[11:55.73]That's like half the deal here.
[12:05.12]Bugs and bug pilled.
[12:06.28]Okay.
[12:07.02]Alright.
[12:08.01]Philbo wants to talk to me.
[12:08.99]Where's Philbo?
[12:10.21]Oh, wait.
[12:10.51]Stop reading.
[12:11.87]What's wrong with him?
[12:12.59]Why is that dude on drugs?
[12:29.23]He's sleepwalking?
[12:31.47]I'll take a glass of air.
[12:33.67]No ice, please.
[12:34.33]Do you have anything?
[12:35.35]No.
[12:35.47]You didn't even serve any food.
[13:02.59]Apparently not.
[13:03.37]Apparently you're not going to serve any of these drinks.
[13:08.53]Hey, get up.
[13:13.19]Wait, if you wake up people that are sleepwalking, can't you instantly kill them?
[13:16.19]You sever their spinal cord or something, right?
[13:20.46]Isn't that possible?
[13:21.62]Can you kill somebody if you wake them up out of a sleepwalk?
[13:24.64]Sleep like this?
[13:25.16]That's a myth.
[13:29.24]You sure?
[13:30.66]Thanks for waking me.
[13:32.79]Oh, you're welcome.
[13:41.12]Another 50 bucks just came in.
[13:42.90]What are you guys doing today?
[13:45.04]5,000 more bits from DonCad.
[13:49.30]Thank you, DonCad, for the 50 fucking dollars.
[13:52.64]Hey Jerma, it's your weed guy.
[13:53.94]I've been outside for an hour and your phone goes straight to voicemail.
[13:56.98]Do you just want me to leave your, in quote, nug snacks at the door?
[14:17.23]You know how weird and awful and embarrassing that would be?
[14:20.49]If I ordered food, and the delivery guy got here, and knew who I was, and heard me scream, Bugsnax!
[14:30.50]And they have this moment of realization where they're like, holy shit.
[14:34.96]I am outside the door of this motherfucker right now.
[14:41.32]You know, imagine like, oh, I'm coming up to this delivery at this place.
[14:43.86]I'm just at a place, just delivering food.
[14:50.66]you'd be like what the are you what hold on like I was just I'm just watching him like I'm delivering this no that just can't be him and he like do you you like comb your hair a little bit
[15:08.04]Here I am at his house.
[15:08.77]I'm here.
[15:09.11]I'm here.
[15:09.39]Hold on a second, guys.
[15:13.79]The fucking delivery guy's here.
[15:15.81]I bet he's a fucking loser.
[15:19.47]Hey.
[15:19.67]Hey, thanks for the food, man.
[15:28.76]You're welcome, Jerma.
[15:31.58]Hey, what?
[15:32.52]What did you just say?
[15:34.64]I, uh, Dremel, I, uh, hey, um, I can't believe, uh, I can't believe I'm here!
[15:39.63]Alright, thanks for the food!
[15:43.03]SLAM!
[15:47.54]Hey, guys!
[15:49.44]Hey, the delivery guy recognized me!
[15:52.36]Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?
[15:54.90]What's this bug do?
[15:55.76]Mmm!
[16:02.75]No tip?
[16:09.67]No, you tipped through the app.
[16:11.09]What are you talking about?
[16:18.52]Yeah, and what he doesn't understand is he's going to look at his phone and there's going to be like a $200 tip and a message that says, hey man, thanks for being a part of the fucking bit.
[16:28.84]Thanks for playing along.
[16:30.56]Take care of yourself.
[16:31.32]Have a great rest of your night, man.
[16:32.54]Thanks for coming.
[16:44.97]and then it turns out I didn't have any money left in my card and I write again hey dude I'm wicked sorry but like I bought a bunch of fucking shit on Amazon and I like didn't realize that I didn't have that money in my account thanks for coming by though
[17:14.33]Chandler funk bun I lift it's a way of life bro anything that needs to go up logs buildings balls snorpy how do we even oh right like somebody said they were delivering weed to my house if I want to push my limits I gotta go somewhere extreme I kind of want to turn this down to a pretzel sounds like a challenge to me we said that was a 4 out of 10 bit
[17:45.99]It's been 18 minutes, man.
[17:47.16]There's gonna be plenty more.
[17:48.24]Probably not, though.
[17:48.84]I'm just, like, lying back in my chair.
[17:50.10]It was a 5 out of 10, maybe.
[17:52.66]It was a 4 out of 10.
[17:53.40]Alright, well, look, your favorite publisher comes out with, like, a 5 out of 10, 6 out of 10 game three times a year.
[18:10.83]They make one good game, like, every five years, and they're like a AAA company.
[18:17.54]Eh, cool.
[18:17.86]What are your thoughts on Bugsnax?
[18:19.76]We rarely get a 10 out of 10 bit from you?
[18:21.82]Whatever.
[18:22.48]Good.
[18:22.78]There's no such thing as a 10 out of 10.
[18:39.97]Bro, Snacksburg was a disaster without Lizbert.
[18:44.06]I couldn't stop all the fighting with lifting or wisdom.
[18:48.36]The voices were a little 10 out of 10.
[18:51.08]He's got a lot of that social anxiety.
[18:56.79]Alright, where's Lizbert?
[18:57.59]Lizbert is top dog, you feel me?
[19:00.07]She really inspires me to test my limits.
[19:03.37]But, uh, that's about it.
[19:05.57]I'm really tighter with Egabel.
[19:08.84]Your meatwad is getting better.
[19:11.84]Is it?
[19:17.26]Your ass is a 10 out of 10 bit.
[19:19.64]That's not even my joke.
[19:21.34]That's, okay, first of all, here's two parts to this.
[19:25.30]That's not my joke, and I just have a huge ass.
[19:28.56]I didn't, that's not like a comedy routine.
[19:31.68]I just have a big fucking huge ass and somebody enlarged it a little bit.
[19:38.86]I didn't do anything.
[19:39.58]I just joined and he's bragging about his ass.
[19:58.89]Is it bragging or is it just me saying things about my body?
[20:05.69]Look, I didn't say, guys, I have a huge fucking ass.
[20:09.92]That's not what happened.
[20:10.68]I just said I have a huge ass.
[20:13.26]I didn't say, look at how huge my... I just said I have... Alright, we're moving on.
[20:28.98]You really slam dunked my questions.
[20:34.52]And how am I supposed to drive the conversation away from my fucking giant bulbous ass?
[20:43.09]It's like half the images you guys link over the last two weeks.
[20:50.57]I'm just gonna ignore that this is what the community is currently on?
[21:00.35]Shit, I was gonna just brag about that.
[21:01.89]Alright, so let's go talk to Philbo.
[21:12.05]Oh, here they are, here are my snacks.
[21:14.13]That's my favorite one right there so far.
[21:16.97]One thing I don't like about it is it has this stupid In-N-Out wrapper on it.
[21:20.54]Because look at how old and retro it is.
[21:23.50]Get a fucking faux wrapper on that and stop putting...
[21:27.07]All the food in a half wrapper in the bag at the drive-thru.
[21:33.21]I hate that so much.
[21:35.93]It's like, do you don't, I don't care that it's in a half wrapper in the bottom of the bag.
[21:41.01]Don't, stop doing that.
[21:43.07]Wrap it up.
[21:43.91]If it's not a to-go order, fine.
[21:47.97]But if it's a to-go order, I don't want my burger out in the open in a half bag in the bottom of a bag.
[21:56.98]I'm sorry.
[21:57.62]If that's like an unpopular opinion, then I'm glad it is.
[22:01.64]I don't care.
[22:02.10]I hate that.
[22:03.22]Holy shit, what's going on?
[22:11.75]You talking shit about In-N-Out, bro?
[22:13.85]Yeah, of course.
[22:16.31]Of course you're the type of guy that would be mad about that.
[22:18.93]Fucking chattler.
[22:19.71]Oh, I have these bags.
[22:26.80]Nutty snack pod.
[22:27.72]What should I do with these?
[22:35.23]Maybe I should feed one of these to somebody.
[22:36.91]Alright, look.
[22:38.33]Will you leave me alone if I give you one of these?
[22:39.76]Can we give him a nut nose?
[22:46.00]Alright, we'll donate the other one.
[22:58.65]Oh no, he doesn't look okay.
[22:59.93]He looks like he's kind of messed up.
[23:03.46]Somebody lift him up and put him in the corner.
[23:05.22]Oh, can I do that?
[23:12.70]I can't help him.
[23:13.76]Somebody help him.
[23:18.15]Oh, you guys weren't lying.
[23:19.15]You can actually pet them.
[23:23.09]Booger!
[23:30.53]Cool.
[23:40.47]Where are my other friends?
[23:42.45]How come these guys are locked up?
[23:43.55]They shouldn't be locked up like this.
[23:47.23]Where's my favorite one?
[23:52.83]There you are.
[23:53.49]There's my favorite.
[23:56.91]I want to go pet my favorite.
[24:03.96]You're a good poptick.
[24:05.52]You're a good George Washington hair.
[24:14.85]Okay, let's go.
[24:15.37]Let's talk to Philbo.
[24:22.11]You're doing a great job, buddy.
[24:23.58]I forgot how odd this guy looked.
[24:24.98]Don't forget to take care of yourself.
[24:27.08]In fact, maybe you should turn in early today and just relax.
[24:33.14]Why do you want me to... Why?
[24:33.92]Alright.
[24:41.20]Something's wrong, buddy.
[24:42.34]We better take a look.
[24:43.74]That's a... Well, what did you... Wait, what's this?
[24:46.02]I can open this, can't I?
[24:47.04]I can open that.
[24:49.08]What happened?
[24:51.16]Somebody's dead.
[24:51.68]Somebody got killed.
[24:52.32]Mavica, Gramble, what happened?
[24:55.81]We saw something real spooky walk right into town.
[24:59.45]I thought it was a grumpus at first, but, like, something about it was...
[25:03.71]You can't not laugh when you talk to some of these people.
[25:09.33]How do they not laugh?
[25:10.31]Not enough drama around town for you lately, huh?
[25:32.75]Zonk off?
[25:34.17]She just told this guy to zonk off.
[25:36.15]Uh-oh.
[25:37.51]Drama.
[25:37.91]This is when you make a student film and you don't know how to edit yet.
[26:00.89]bit high strung a little beauty sleep would do you wonders everyone just do their lines and I just go like this you say that again doesn't matter if they're looking at the camera there's no need for all that if what gramble and befic are saying is true there's got to be some physical evidence left behind yeah
[26:26.67]I didn't even know he was talking.
[26:42.07]Why do I have to investigate the bathroom every time?
[26:47.15]Can you go look at the restroom and find out if I... I don't want to look at the bathroom anymore.
[26:51.04]Wait, I'm also one of these things?
[26:54.52]What?
[26:55.67]I'm one of these things?
[26:57.69]I am.
[26:58.35]But how come I don't eat anything?
[26:59.57]Oh, I found something.
[27:07.19]Found something.
[27:08.56]A rusty spade discarded near the sign.
[27:10.66]Smells like snacks.
[27:13.10]I have an allergy.
[27:14.08]Oh.
[27:14.72]I didn't... Well, I knew I was like a... I didn't know I was one of these mutant Muppet people.
[27:22.06]Oh, what's that?
[27:27.77]Eggs.
[27:30.99]Eggs.
[27:31.45]Granville knits all of her own eggs.
[27:36.50]Okay, cool.
[27:38.76]Two out of six clues.
[27:47.50]Oh, there's a clue.
[27:49.02]Footprints.
[27:50.45]Messy paw-like prints lead from one edge of Snackburg to the garden.
[27:59.55]What about, what about you?
[28:00.75]It's you!
[28:02.25]It's Tiffany.
[28:03.35]Tiffany, oh no, you're just investigating, okay.
[28:08.35]Tiffany, get out of the way.
[28:12.02]Wait, what?
[28:14.32]More paw prints.
[28:20.64]Even more paw prints.
[28:22.22]Bug prints.
[28:23.40]Bug snack tracks scatter from where the grumpus tracks stop.
[28:30.97]We need another clue in the toilet.
[28:43.16]What did I miss?
[28:43.56]What did I miss?
[28:48.96]It's a community shitter.
[28:54.26]Yeah, that is kind of gross.
[29:02.93]Ah, I see.
[29:05.66]No more Bugsnax.
[29:08.74]It's a warning.
[29:12.24]Bilbo, where are you?
[29:13.04]Dude.
[29:13.26]Yeah, they all go to the bathroom in the same place.
[29:16.90]I mean, I guess... Wait.
[29:20.31]That is not... Like, your family does that.
[29:23.41]Isn't that, like, weird?
[29:26.13]That is not, like, that weird.
[29:28.61]If you live in a house with more than, like, two or three people that you go... You use the same toilets.
[29:36.30]It's not that weird.
[29:38.18]But every single one of you guys has your own toilet in your own room?
[29:47.76]No, no, what?
[29:49.87]No, you don't.
[29:53.25]Who has more than like three or four bathrooms?
[29:57.81]I guess if you have like six bedrooms.
[30:02.47]Like four, five, six bathrooms?
[30:05.66]That's a lot of bathrooms.
[30:10.18]Alright, there are tracks that aren't quite grumpus.
[30:12.22]Well, that's... I reckon there's got to be some other explanation.
[30:17.01]Cram it, Wampo.
[30:18.11]We got a genuine monster on our paws.
[30:20.91]Chat bourgeoisie.
[30:22.61]Gaslighting.
[30:51.17]It's the word of the day on this stream.
[30:53.09]Every day.
[30:55.24]You haven't even drawn one chart.
[30:57.82]I was top of the charts.
[30:59.40]Thank you.
[31:00.56]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[31:01.48]You know what?
[31:02.04]Let's split the difference, eh?
[31:03.68]You're both wrong.
[31:05.62]What does it even matter?
[31:07.03]He's got those, like, popsicle feet.
[31:09.31]Between this and the earthquakes, Snagsburg's becoming pretty unlivable.
[31:13.87]Who, okay, who wore it best, right?
[31:16.35]Who's got the best out?
[31:17.27]Who's got the best mutated body?
[31:20.87]I know, I have my favorite.
[31:22.59]Same goes for me and my little ones.
[31:26.49]It's probably him.
[31:27.41]Or it's cookie marshmallow nose.
[31:28.61]Mayor, yeah.
[31:28.97]I feel like I don't want to change him.
[31:48.85]Listen, I don't know why Lisbert put me in charge, but I do know this.
[31:54.01]None of you were really happy out there alone.
[31:56.75]What's wrong with him?
[31:57.49]What?
[31:57.85]Are you implying that, like, none of us, all of us combined are, like, just barely as interesting or cool as Lisbert?
[32:08.38]That's not putting that much confidence in us.
[32:23.99]If you must find Floofty, according to the tracking device I placed on them, they're out by Boiling Bay.
[32:29.65]Which is that way.
[32:30.25]The last time I saw Sheldah, she was meditating in the Sizzling Sands.
[32:35.09]Sheldah?
[32:35.67]Don't forget about Agabelle.
[32:37.77]If she's not with Lisbeth, we've got to find her.
[32:40.83]This is the Jerma985 quote funny voice.
[32:44.64]I can't wait to play Legend of Sheldah.
[32:46.28]How does that sound?
[32:49.02]Great!
[32:50.52]Now, let's go get some sleep.
[32:59.19]Okay, we gotta find Sheldah.
[33:02.63]Yeah, he does take the cake.
[33:04.05]Search the Frosted Peak.
[33:07.01]Mountain climb.
[33:08.41]Ooh.
[33:11.79]Alright, so let's take a look.
[33:14.65]We got a few people.
[33:15.67]We got find Sheldah, find Floofty, and then climb the mountain.
[33:22.33]Floofty is in the Boiling Bay.
[33:23.79]Sheldah is in the Sizzling Sands.
[33:27.98]We just gotta keep going.
[33:28.76]Where are we at?
[33:31.01]Those are two places that we have not seen.
[33:34.03]How do we get to the Sizzling Sands?
[33:35.95]Didn't he go that way?
[33:42.23]Sizzling Sands?
[33:43.89]Okay, this is Shimmering Springs.
[33:47.32]We go down to Shimmering Springs and maybe over to Sizzling Sands.
[33:52.02]Wait, there's a hut down here I want to open.
[33:58.50]Pronounce the D. Sands.
[34:01.32]Sands.
[34:03.30]Sands.
[34:05.50]Saying the D is weird.
[34:08.97]Sizzling sands.
[34:10.65]Sands.
[34:15.87]The D is silent when you say sands.
[34:18.63]Sand.
[34:20.14]Sands.
[34:21.34]Sands.
[34:22.36]Hey, that's mine!
[34:32.49]This isn't Tommy Boy.
[34:34.51]Chris Farley and David Spade do this.
[34:37.73]They're like, oh, I love saying words.
[34:38.99]You know, that's another funny word.
[34:40.35]Limit.
[34:41.23]Limit.
[34:42.25]Limit.
[34:42.59]Limit.
[34:42.99]Limit.
[34:43.51]Limit.
[34:45.45]This happens in Tommy Boy.
[34:46.57]Alright, this is the Boiling Bay.
[34:53.79]We got some new things to investigate here.
[34:56.89]A golden quibble?
[35:00.15]I feel like that's important.
[35:01.33]Whatever.
[35:06.77]I like this place.
[35:07.43]Ooh, what's this?
[35:10.23]Another so- uh, a la soda.
[35:13.79]This bug skims along the ocean floor and sprays water at nearby sauce.
[35:18.71]He hates all sauce.
[35:20.71]It's a La Croix.
[35:24.84]This is apple?
[35:25.86]A green crapple.
[35:30.86]Loves chocolate and loves honey.
[35:35.92]I love green apples.
[35:36.72]They're awesome.
[35:37.66]Alright, what else?
[35:38.22]Anybody else we can look at?
[35:42.81]Weird tree.
[35:43.67]A tree that jumpy Bugsnax can hide in.
[35:51.23]Well, I know.
[35:51.65]Okay, I get it.
[35:53.43]So we're going to trip them.
[35:55.35]Let's try it.
[35:59.85]So this, we need to use the trip shot.
[36:03.51]Set it up right here.
[36:04.21]And then we're gonna aim it this way.
[36:08.89]And fire.
[36:10.99]Wait, I can't do it there?
[36:16.06]Can't, I can't do it there.
[36:23.72]Got a red banana burr.
[36:28.44]Loves chocolate.
[36:29.12]Jumps from tree to tree.
[36:30.03]The trip shot could be useful here.
[36:31.41]Also, it is red.
[36:33.87]Loves chocolate.
[36:34.59]Alright, but where do I set the trip shot up?
[36:36.33]I can't get up there.
[36:52.07]I broke it!
[36:55.32]Climb the tree?
[36:56.18]Hit it while it's in the air.
[37:01.02]I don't think that's what you do.
[37:06.89]Trip shot.
[37:09.61]Alright, but hold on.
[37:10.11]Wait, can I go?
[37:10.65]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37:12.88]We can go from here to here.
[37:16.40]What the fuck is wrong with this thing?
[37:34.14]Alright, there we go.
[37:35.59]Now, I'm going to cover this in chocolate.
[37:38.85]He's going to love it.
[38:03.47]No, get in closer.
[38:05.65]Get in closer.
[38:06.83]No, no.
[38:07.61]Get back here.
[38:17.56]Get back here.
[38:29.26]He's going to come over here and spit at this, but he's going to stand here.
[38:32.06]I thought he was going to come over and get mad.
[38:33.16]I don't know how far his range was.
[38:35.80]Get over here.
[38:36.18]There you go.
[38:38.41]Okay, good.
[38:40.91]That's not where I wanted you to...
[39:04.46]Got a slug.
[39:04.98]Got a banana slug.
[39:09.41]Alright, now what do you like?
[39:18.41]I want to get you, too.
[39:22.16]Alright, you hate all sauce.
[39:24.14]You have to destroy sauce.
[39:26.56]It's built into your bug DNA.
[39:29.48]But I'm out.
[39:30.02]Okay, I have ketchup still.
[39:31.46]Hold on.
[39:33.76]I'm going to put this, like, here.
[39:37.17]And then he's going to get so pissed off at this sauce over here, he's not going to be able to stand it.
[39:54.13]What was that?
[39:56.41]Here we go.
[39:59.05]Catch you, motherfucker.
[40:02.70]Now, how do I get you?
[40:04.24]You... prefers to stay underwater, but will surface to pick up things that catch its eye.
[40:08.56]He loves chocolate.
[40:09.45]He'll come to the surface to pick up chocolate.
[40:12.05]I got no chocolate left.
[40:12.89]This is what I get for not being prepared.
[40:16.17]Oh.
[40:17.81]Oh, there's a bobsicle.
[40:22.08]Should I get another bobsicle, just to have?
[40:26.16]Yeah, definitely.
[40:28.34]Was that even a question?
[40:37.68]Oh, he didn't hit the wall?
[40:40.32]Wait, this is like a multi-flavored popsicle.
[40:43.62]Hold on.
[40:46.36]This is one of those like rocket ship popsicles.
[40:49.56]No!
[40:51.22]These are Patapons now.
[40:58.81]What are you doing here?
[40:59.51]You took my precious time getting here.
[41:01.29]Any longer and my leg might have rotted away.
[41:03.29]Come, let's finish our work.
[41:06.16]Alright, you going back to Snackburg?
[41:07.56]I will assist you.
[41:08.80]If it means you go back to Bugburg.
[41:10.34]You guys hate that, why?
[41:11.04]Oh no, sorry, one person did, sorry.
[41:36.33]Alright, turn Floofy's hand into a red banana up here.
[41:38.70]I already- I got one!
[41:43.08]Turn Floofy's hand into a- a banana.
[41:47.58]Which hand?
[41:47.98]Does it matter?
[41:53.62]A red banana hand.
[41:54.76]Excellent.
[41:55.92]That is one more thing I must do.
[41:57.84]Hand me the Snactivator.
[41:59.44]The old Snactivator was worth a scrap.
[42:00.86]The old Snactivator was worth a scrap.
[42:02.60]I have updated it.
[42:04.08]It is now capable of altering... No more zonking off.
[42:06.60]...the process of Sonic anamnesis.
[42:10.16]My body remembers what I eat.
[42:12.20]The Snactivator can change snackified limbs into anything I've ever eaten.
[42:18.09]Use it.
[42:18.97]Change my arm from Bonaparte to Straby.
[42:29.56]I missed that.
[42:30.26]I missed it.
[42:30.82]I missed it.
[42:31.78]Turn Floopty's hand into a strabby snack-spermant?
[42:37.70]A strabby.
[42:38.28]I can't even.
[42:40.94]I can't even talk.
[42:42.44]It's too much.
[42:43.20]It's too much.
[42:44.04]It's too much.
[42:45.00]So I can just turn people's legs and body parts into whatever I want?
[43:02.45]What strain are you smoking?
[43:05.39]I don't smoke weed.
[43:06.15]Ungodly.
[43:06.75]Degenerate.
[43:07.25]Degeneracy.
[43:08.09]I eat it.
[43:08.73]Alright, turn the limbs into kokomites.
[43:33.91]Alright, snack experiment!
[43:36.31]Oh.
[43:36.99]I need- we need to get four cocomites.
[43:39.71]Four Jermamites.
[43:40.65]Alright, there's coconuts.
[43:43.95]Maybe they're up in the coconut.
[43:45.41]That's not a- How did I land on- what happened to me?
[43:47.79]Oh.
[43:52.94]What's this?
[43:55.04]A sherby, it drills beneath the sand, waiting to unleash frosty vengeance on its foes.
[44:01.48]It's a ju- Oh!
[44:03.70]I love this thing.
[44:06.47]I love Sherbert.
[44:07.39]It's like my favorite thing ever.
[44:10.93]You're my favorite.
[44:11.75]I need you.
[44:12.77]I must have you.
[44:14.97]No, don't die!
[44:15.75]No, no, don't die.
[44:17.15]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[44:18.05]You're alive.
[44:18.45]You're okay.
[44:19.19]I'll put you out in a minute.
[44:22.64]Ow!
[44:22.96]Wait, I'm on fire.
[44:24.38]Come on, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[44:26.36]Into the water, into the water.
[44:27.32]Come here.
[44:28.86]Into the water.
[44:30.49]Quickly!
[44:30.81]What do you like?
[44:31.23]What do you hate?
[44:31.59]What do you don't like?
[44:32.13]What are your interests?
[44:33.07]What do you love?
[44:34.03]I got him.
[44:44.40]I saved him right when he was on the verge of death.
[44:50.53]I love Sherbert.
[44:52.97]Ooh, there's a clue.
[44:56.11]You picked up Liz's notes on a secret code.
[44:58.85]I think this is... Oh, this is the second part of the code.
[45:02.09]I have both these now.
[45:02.77]Let me see.
[45:04.43]Hold on.
[45:10.13]A muddy projector tape.
[45:11.73]Okay, here we go.
[45:12.79]Looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates in order.
[45:14.95]First left.
[45:16.96]Then right.
[45:17.88]Then center.
[45:18.72]And after that, push down hard on all three.
[45:21.42]Alright.
[45:25.18]Bad link.
[45:27.22]Well, when you rush to make an image, and you don't even care to save it as anything, and it's called unknown.png, that means that you just, you so quickly tried to rush that out.
[45:44.18]I'm assuming it's not very high effort.
[45:48.88]Okay.
[45:51.78]Okay, I know the code now, the puzzle.
[45:55.17]I need to get coconuts.
[45:58.18]Shut the fuck up, you idiot.
[46:00.34]What?
[46:08.47]Don't STFU me.
[46:11.77]It'll take a powerful force to crack this Bugsnax shell open.
[46:15.07]How do I... Okay.
[46:19.13]So, launch rock at it.
[46:20.55]Can I grab it with the grabber?
[46:24.11]I can grab it.
[46:24.75]Okay.
[46:25.71]So then, now we need to smash it.
[46:31.18]How do we smash?
[46:36.18]Does anybody run at you?
[46:37.26]Is there a... Hold on.
[46:40.78]Is there a bug that... There's a phoenix in there.
[46:43.34]Hold on.
[46:44.08]What is that?
[46:46.48]Flamin' cheese poof.
[46:48.99]Oh, it's a flamin' hot cheeto.
[46:55.05]That's funny.
[46:56.77]Is there like a nutcracker in here?
[47:00.19]A noodler bathes in pools of lava.
[47:02.88]It's hot noodles?
[47:06.00]Can't be put out while in such a hot climate.
[47:10.74]Oh, this is like the hot, this is the spicy room.
[47:16.25]This is so cool.
[47:17.25]I love this.
[47:21.81]What are you doing in here?
[47:24.71]You don't belong here.
[47:26.65]You don't belong in like the hot, spicy climate.
[47:28.62]You're lost.
[47:29.24]Follow me.
[47:39.30]Come here.
[47:39.78]Come here.
[47:40.74]Come here.
[47:41.76]Come on.
[47:42.02]Come on.
[47:42.26]Run.
[47:42.46]Run.
[47:42.64]Run.
[47:42.86]I want the big one.
[47:44.62]I want the big one.
[47:45.10]I want the big one.
[47:47.89]Nice.
[47:52.97]No, you're a bobsicle.
[47:53.93]Okay, I need to break this.
[48:01.42]How do I smash this thing?
[48:03.58]There's got to be a smasher bug here somewhere.
[48:06.70]Are you a smasher?
[48:08.18]Smash that.
[48:14.74]Put it in the lava?
[48:20.52]I don't think... I'm sorry.
[48:24.69]I'm sorry.
[48:25.03]How do I put you out?
[48:29.07]Sauce?
[48:33.99]Whoa!
[48:40.16]Get in there!
[48:41.10]No, he's too heavy.
[48:41.70]I gotta pick him up.
[48:46.49]I don't- wait, maybe they bump- bump- Yo, yo, hey, hey, hey!
[48:54.16]Okay, works with its lesser to tackle any threats.
[49:08.49]Why is he- he's- he's draw- he's drowning himself!
[49:12.17]What happened?
[49:14.34]What is he doing?
[49:14.90]I just got a free soda!

[78:13.06]French fry nose.
[78:19.76]Didn't I say I wanted to turn somebody into a pretzel?
[78:22.85]Yeah, and then we're gonna do a soda can.
[78:25.27]Yeah, that's good.
[78:26.97]Maybe soda can teeth.
[78:38.46]Yeah.
[78:39.08]Ow.
[78:39.20]Alright, you're good.
[78:46.44]I want to change you, but I don't want to change you from every four-year-old's drawing.
[78:51.79]I kinda have to keep you like this.
[79:02.87]What about you?
[79:15.60]Pineapple, alright, definitely pineapple feet.
[79:20.40]Pineapple feet, popcorn hands.
[79:25.67]What about cheesy poof hair?
[79:26.79]Uh, olive head.
[79:32.15]Olive hair?
[79:32.67]What about popcorn ear?
[79:39.12]Yeah, hold on.
[79:40.48]This is good.
[79:50.82]It's Grandma?
[79:52.64]Kinda.
[79:54.58]Alright, plant a Snack Whirl in the garden.
[79:58.15]That's not what I want to track.
[79:59.01]What was I doing?
[80:02.23]Okay, mountain climb.
[80:03.27]Right.
[80:07.19]There's still two other Snackburg residents that I have not found yet.
[80:10.61]And one of them's here.
[80:11.33]Okay, Eggabelle.
[80:14.13]We have to go to the Frosted Peak.
[80:18.34]Cheese sauce.
[80:19.94]Where do I get cheese sauce?
[80:20.98]From him?
[80:21.34]Cheese sauce.
[80:21.90]You know what?
[80:23.56]I could go.
[80:24.00]It's only been like an hour and a half.
[80:25.49]I can't talk about this right now.
[80:39.45]But I'm gonna, because fuck it, you know what I mean?
[80:41.51]I want, right now, a, like, 12-inch soft, like, white sub roll.
[80:50.53]And just shaved ribeye.
[80:52.85]Just slapped in it.
[80:55.12]And I want to watch the guy.
[80:56.68]I want to watch the guy take the big knife, take the big, hot loaf of bread, and just slice down the middle with a huge knife.
[81:02.00]You know what I'm talking?
[81:02.52]You guys know what I mean, right?
[81:03.66]He's got that long-ass knife, and he just goes like, whoop!
[81:06.50]And he opens it.
[81:08.08]And then just slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.
[81:10.46]Rib eye, rib eye.
[81:11.06]Just like perfectly cooked rib eye.
[81:12.35]A little bit of onion.
[81:15.45]Just like raw onion.
[81:16.63]And then just take the fucking wet cheese sauce.
[81:20.23]The gross stuff from the movie theater.
[81:22.21]And just pump it on there.
[81:25.25]Close it.
[81:26.33]Wrap it up in foil.
[81:27.42]In foil.
[81:27.90]It better be in foil or I don't want it.
[81:30.24]Wrap it in foil.
[81:31.90]Put it in a bag.
[81:33.02]And ding!
[81:34.28]Hit the thing and give it to me.
[81:47.38]I will take if you don't have the movie theater cheese sauce I will absolutely take you taking the sub roll and using it as a glove to pick up the mess of meat cheese and onions that is on the flat top and like putting it face down and closing it and picking it up
[82:13.05]You know what I'm talking about?
[82:14.59]Where it's like the meat, the cheese, and all the stuff is on the flat top.
[82:19.17]And they take the sub roll, it's open, they butterfly it open, place it face down on the flat top with the meat and the cheese and everything, and they like hold it up, scoop it up.
[82:29.96]I'll take that too.
[82:32.96]I can't wait when you get to the end.
[82:48.18]The end of the roll.
[82:51.63]First of all, it's cut in half.
[82:52.73]Let's be clear.
[82:53.79]It's cut in half.
[82:55.13]You go through the front part.
[82:57.11]The end of the sub roll has this bunched up bunch of cheese in the very end of the roll.
[83:05.20]And there's just a little bit of meat in there.
[83:09.48]And it's the best part.
[83:10.48]I used to go door to door selling gruel to grandmas.
[83:18.02]Like, VH1's the best thing I ever ate.
[83:24.45]What am I doing?
[83:25.75]Well, Food Network.
[83:27.09]Just like super cut me into that show.
[83:30.13]He wants to fuck a sandwich?
[83:44.78]I don't want to fuck a sandwich.
[83:47.14]If that's what you got from this.
[83:49.40]Oh, by the way.
[83:51.53]By the way, I got a story.
[83:53.19]Who cares what he's saying?
[83:54.11]I have a story for you.
[83:54.87]Remember when I played Lego Star Wars?
[83:57.61]And I told you guys?
[83:58.81]I'm playing Lego Star Wars right now.
[84:00.21]I have to stop saying fuck and stuff like that, right?
[84:02.44]Because this is like a kid's game.
[84:04.06]Okay.
[84:04.72]My nieces and nephews love Lego Star Wars.
[84:08.08]It's like their favorite thing in the world.
[84:09.96]And I got a text.
[84:12.30]From my parents.
[84:14.44]And from my sister.
[84:16.72]That said, hey, um, just want to let you know the kids were watching your stream because they love Lego Star Wars and we had to mute you because you kept saying fuck so much.
[84:27.97]It's like, oh my god, why did you do that?
[84:35.30]The kids love Lego Star Wars.
[84:37.46]It's like their favorite thing in the world right now, apparently.
[84:40.70]And I had to have been like the only person on Twitch playing that game.
[84:45.71]I was swearing a lot.
[84:46.73]And, like, I think they were watching during the swamp section.
[84:51.69]So... You can see my surprise and my embarrassment when I know that, like, my family is gathering around the fire and putting Uncle up on the screen while I freak the fuck out at a children's Lego game that they all love and I'm losing my mind over it.
[85:08.64]Like, you have to... Just think about how I may have felt when I was told that.
[85:15.33]And I said on that stream.
[85:16.74]Maybe actually be careful because this is a kid's game.
[85:20.26]Yeah, we're saying so much fucked up shit.
[85:39.34]Oh, man.
[85:40.70]I gotta grow up.
[85:41.28]I gotta grow up a little bit.
[85:42.64]I think that's the wake-up call.
[85:43.90]It's time to grow up, right?
[85:44.84]I gotta grow up.
[85:45.58]I'm like in my 30s.
[85:46.46]I gotta grow up.
[85:49.61]I think that's the catalyst.
[85:51.01]That's it.
[85:51.31]Omega Lil, time to grow up.
[85:52.75]Hahaha.
[86:01.52]What about Peter Pan?
[86:02.44]Is Peter Pan, like, 60?
[86:02.92]How old is Peter Pan?
[86:04.02]Like, in the actual lore, Peter Pan was, like, a kid who never grew up, and he never grew old, and he was Peter Pan, and he could fly.
[86:10.86]Right?
[86:11.04]He was, like, 65 years old.
[86:35.09]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[86:35.85]I get it, pal.
[86:36.99]I'm not the nicest grump that's around.
[86:39.79]I learned early on that life is like a box of trash.
[86:43.34]You always know what you're gonna get.
[86:45.86]A trash van.
[86:47.88]Just go check out where the boat was.
[86:50.24]See what you think of living.
[86:51.24]Come in here.
[86:51.70]I start eating garbage.
[86:52.98]Eat garbage.
[86:54.89]What a great show.
[86:56.49]Oh, I got a map.
[87:04.66]At the end of the Boiling Bay, past the shipwreck, Liz was definitely over there.
[87:07.62]You'll see.
[87:10.68]Oh, I did see that.
[87:11.60]It didn't let me pick it up, though.
[87:18.31]I need to grow up.
[87:18.97]Also, Peter Pan lore is cool, right?
[87:21.77]I never said it was cool.
[87:22.73]I just said it was a fact.
[87:29.75]Hello, darling.
[87:32.87]Toys R Us don't grow up.
[87:35.19]No, Toys R Us don't grow up.
[87:36.81]Toys R Us just go out of business.
[87:43.43]They didn't grow up.
[87:45.16]So they failed.
[87:54.14]Oh, sorry.
[87:54.66]You kept on distracting me.
[87:55.72]Alright, where are we going?
[87:56.72]I need cheese sauce.
[88:01.18]Hello.
[88:01.46]Do you sell cheese sauce?

[88:59.32]Where do I get cheese sauce?
[89:03.32]Where does one get cheese?
[89:06.76]That's a lot of money.
[89:08.28]Somebody just dumped a huge amount of money.
[89:11.68]That's 50 community subs.
[89:12.82]You gave me 50.
[89:17.44]Lagx65 just dropped 50 community subs.
[89:23.81]That's a big one.
[89:24.93]That's a big one.
[89:29.11]Thanks for the insane sub drop.
[89:33.73]That's insane.
[89:34.55]That's 50.
[89:37.17]Congratulations to all the subs.
[89:42.68]Sing the community sub song.
[89:45.42]Everything has to have a song on this channel.
[89:51.37]Oh, you're gonna go BRB and go pee?
[89:52.95]Oh, sing the I peed song.
[89:54.71]Hey!
[89:56.81]Is this a children's TV show?
[89:59.75]Where all the basic functions, I just sing you songs about like pooping your diaper and going pee and like why you should have good manners at the dinner table and eating fruits and apples is good for you?
[90:10.08]Why does everything have to have a song?
[90:17.19]Should I make a song about how like cleaning up after playing with your toys is a good idea?
[90:24.27]Alright, I gotta go get the... Hold on.
[90:30.64]Deal or no?
[90:31.10]Alright, main.

[90:35.50]The frosted peak.
[90:38.64]That is... Flavor Falls?
[90:44.01]Or here?
[90:46.65]Where is that?
[90:48.35]I think that's Flavor Falls, right?
[90:54.36]Upgrade your shit.
[90:55.75]Huh?
[90:57.37]Sugar pine.
[90:58.51]Sugar pine woods.
[90:59.83]Which is this way.

[91:09.79]Shit.
[91:10.11]Upgrade.
[91:10.45]Upgrade.
[91:10.73]I don't know.
[91:11.13]What do you mean?
[91:24.72]Yeah, but is it weird that this... Okay, so they watched it muted.
[91:30.04]But don't you think it's worse with this being muted?
[91:33.59]I don't think you would want to watch this muted.
[91:36.55]That makes it strange and scary.
[91:45.27]That's scary.
[91:48.31]Okay, we're at Flavor... I almost said Flavor Flav Peak.
[91:51.78]Because you got it in my mind.
[91:53.84]We gotta go this way.
[92:03.49]How do you explain that picture to your parents?
[92:10.35]Guys, I think my parents just, like, kind of don't pay attention anymore.
[92:16.97]Because... It's like... Okay, after the family dinner stream, it was like, okay, he's, like, just kind of fucking gonna do this weird shit.
[92:27.88]Alright, well, that's funny, I guess.
[92:30.90]Good luck, son.
[92:42.18]It's funny because my mother actually does watch some of the streams.
[92:47.21]Be like, oh, you know, I saw you doing this the other day.
[92:49.21]And I'm like, you did?
[92:49.85]Oh.
[92:52.45]I... I'm still in the will, right?
[92:55.53]Like, I still... You're not... I'm not... You're not gonna, like, disown me or anything, right?
[93:01.06]No, I've removed you from all of those.
[93:03.20]It's all going to your sister because she's smart.
[93:05.52]She grew up.
[93:06.82]I heard you talking about Peter Pan.
[93:14.91]Alright, we're at the Frosted Peak.
[93:16.59]There's new enemies here.
[93:19.63]The Mountain Dew in here.
[93:21.76]This bug washes away sauce and somehow stays unfrozen in the cold.
[93:30.24]No, I'm kidding.
[93:32.11]My parents are very, very supportive.
[93:34.71]They are.
[93:35.07]They are.
[93:39.49]They are.
[93:43.72]Ooh, creamy patch.
[93:44.90]This melty pile of ice cream and cookies.
[93:50.94]That is a banana sundae.
[93:53.32]That's a banana split.
[93:58.94]Catches prey in its forelegs and freezes them.
[94:04.32]It loves chocolate.
[94:08.08]Oh, that's cool.
[94:08.98]What's on the peak?
[94:12.99]I didn't get any sauce.
[94:14.33]Uh... Ooh, what's this one?
[94:20.88]A Stoodler?
[94:21.64]This boiling snack is a source of warmth.
[94:28.64]This is so cool.
[94:29.62]I love him.
[94:35.83]This is way cooler than Pokémon, it is.
[94:37.73]God, like, fucking, like, bla- like, blast- punch me in the face, some of you.
[94:43.13]I- whatever, I'll just rock my head back and go, I still believe it!
[94:56.04]Butter jam?
[94:57.30]This elusive flyer is looking for its favorite sauce.
[95:00.26]It wants to be coated in honey.
[95:11.04]What's this?
[95:11.84]Creamy goo.
[95:12.88]Jelly goop.
[95:17.44]Oh, that's definitely from the jelly monster.
[95:19.31]Okay, where are the... Melty... Are these Dippin' Dots?
[95:25.35]These are Dippin' Dots, aren't they?
[95:27.07]I didn't... Why did I not scan it?
[95:28.43]What's wrong with me?
[95:29.29]Why did I not scan this?
[95:31.13]It's Dippin' Dots.
[95:37.62]I gotta get you.
[95:50.91]Oh, how would I pick that up?
[95:52.07]Right.
[95:58.01]I think I could get it right here.
[95:58.91]I could get it.
[95:59.29]Yeah, I could get it when he turns around.
[96:05.42]Hurry up!
[96:12.02]Here we go.
[96:12.28]Ready?
[96:12.42]Grapple.
[96:17.81]Would that work?
[96:18.95]I think he's... It's ooey and gooey.
[96:21.76]I don't... It's too sticky.
[96:34.75]Too sticky.
[96:37.45]I'll get it.
[96:37.73]What are you doing?
[96:49.76]I fucking hate you.
[96:56.86]Whatever.
[96:57.88]Why did I just do that?
[96:58.52]I just jumped off the cliff.
[96:59.60]Alright.
[97:00.66]I need... I'm so overwhelmed.
[97:02.62]Alright, stop.
[97:03.82]Everybody stop.
[97:09.53]What the fuck is that?
[97:11.57]It's a chocolate chip cookie.
[97:14.35]I need sauces.
[97:15.25]Alright, I've... Get out of here.
[97:18.04]Do this right.
[97:18.80]I keep on freaking out and just being like, oh my god, look at this!
[97:21.14]Oh my god, what's that?
[97:22.03]Did you see that?
[97:22.77]Look at this!
[97:23.81]I need to get sauces and get my tools ready, and... I gotta get sauces.
[97:32.81]Where am I?
[97:33.17]I gotta go around and collect sauces.
[97:41.38]I want a bunch of sauces and I'm gonna be ready for this.
[97:46.16]No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[97:50.52]Oh, sorry.
[97:51.14]No more Mr. Nice, Gemma.
[97:59.72]No more Mr. Nice guy.
[98:01.58]Who's the first person to say that?
[98:02.76]Where did that come from?
[98:10.57]That was some movie in like the 40s or something, right?
[98:14.71]It was Alice Cooper.
[98:24.15]Was it?
[98:25.61]It was Julius Caesar.
[98:26.93]Alright, what do you love?
[98:30.93]Chocolate, don't have it.
[98:38.96]It was Socrates.
[98:40.84]Alright, who was the guy back in the day that drank the poison on purpose?
[98:46.50]He was like, I know they're trying to kill me.
[98:48.95]Let them do it, but you all will see it happen and you'll know the truth.
[98:57.25]No, not Rasputin.
[98:58.37]No, no, no, no, no.
[98:59.29]It was like some old philosopher.
[99:02.16]He knew they were trying to kill him and he drank it anyways in front of a bunch of people.
[99:05.56]It was like, I'm going to die now and you'll all see the corruption.
[99:10.52]And it had happened.
[99:13.28]That was Socrates.
[99:13.96]It was.
[99:14.23]Okay, I need... I want chocolate.
[99:20.63]I want hot sauce.
[99:21.39]I want all the sauces.
[99:22.23]All of them.
[99:24.53]20 out of 20.
[99:26.31]We're going to sauce hunting right now.
[99:30.83]Socrates was given the choice between death and exile and he chose death.
[99:35.57]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[99:36.15]And he like did it in front of a bunch of people.
[99:38.46]Didn't he?
[99:44.26]He was like, I'd rather die with the truth than live with the lies.
[99:51.27]He drank it on stream.
[100:01.54]What the fuck?
[100:03.22]Oh.
[100:09.24]Have you watched?
[100:10.00]I've not watched anything.
[100:12.64]A raid from Socrates.
[100:15.27]He's just in like stunner shades.
[100:18.29]Playing like Fortnite.
[100:25.27]No, this is peanut butter.
[100:27.83]I don't want peanut butter, I want chocolate, hot sauce, ketchup, mustard, pickles, ketchup, mustard, olives, mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, and mayo.
[100:39.22]Here's my fries.
[100:40.54]Alright, where are we going?
[100:44.94]Go to town, re.
[100:56.00]Here comes a Gandhi raid.
[101:06.67]I go to town re, go to town re.
[101:08.81]So where are they?
[101:13.45]I love you.
[101:14.35]Having trouble with your pets there?
[101:18.02]Shut it, Wambus.
[101:19.18]My little ones are just excited to see me.
[101:21.70]That's so.
[101:22.50]These guys are always just arguing and fighting.
[101:23.92]It's easy to keep them in line when they're half your size.
[101:27.74]What are you saying?
[101:29.52]You really love Bugsnax so bad?
[101:32.90]Go big or go home?
[101:37.58]Go on back to your cactus, you old coot.
[101:39.94]I just want you to know that I'm on his side.
[101:48.52]I'm not on your side.
[101:49.68]I think I find you to be kind of in the wrong right now.
[101:52.94]As a friend, I feel like I should let you know.
[101:58.46]You and I are still really cool.
[101:59.48]You kind of beat a dick.
[102:00.36]I've got to be honest with you.
[102:05.82]Hit me up tomorrow, though.
[102:07.06]Let's go get coffee or something and just chill out.
[102:09.84]I think you're kind of a problem.
[102:11.82]Alright.
[102:13.06]Bye.
[102:13.44]Dude, I'm sorry, but I'm... Alright.
[102:15.10]Just hit me up tomorrow or something, man.
[102:19.60]Jesus, dude.
[102:20.30]I don't fucking know what his problem is.
[102:21.68]I'm sorry.
[102:22.66]I just talk to him.
[102:24.92]I don't know.
[102:27.07]No, I mean, you're just doing your thing and he's kind of just fine off the handle and shit, man.
[102:31.61]Sorry.
[102:33.17]I don't want any more peanut butter!
[102:34.47]Stop planning this!
[102:37.73]Oh.
[102:47.68]Psycho.
[102:48.64]After all that, I'm the guy.
[102:51.20]I'm the bad guy.
[102:52.96]Get the plants.
[102:54.12]I'm getting them.
[102:54.70]Look, chocolate, ketchup.
[102:58.52]The Travis Scott burger.
[103:00.56]Here's my quarter pounder with peanut butter, hot sauce, ketchup, mustard, and chocolate.
[103:16.67]Are you mad that I'm taking all these?
[103:20.23]Where's the mustard?
[103:21.33]How have I not found that yet?
[103:22.29]The second they grow, they are taken.
[103:33.90]That's what you eat for dinner?
[103:35.22]I actually don't like ketchup that much.
[103:38.09]I like ketchup as a dipper, not as something that's on food.
[103:46.27]I'd rather be the one that rules the destiny of when and where ketchup is applied.
[103:51.93]I don't want it pre-applied to anything.
[103:54.49]I want to be the one to make that choice.
[103:56.77]I like it, but I don't want it on something predetermined.
[104:02.06]Okay, I almost got full.
[104:10.08]I feel the same way about mustard, too.
[104:13.89]Because here's the thing, it's really easy to overpower the hell out of whatever you're eating.
[104:18.57]If somebody applies ketchup that's too much ketchup than you wanted, it's over.
[104:23.37]And don't tell me just scrape it off.
[104:25.33]It ruins the whole experience.
[104:27.23]Because then the bun or whatever, the thing is already wet and kind of weird and soggy and it has that weird coating of... No.
[104:35.48]Okay, I've got 20, 20, 20, 20, 20.
[104:40.54]Same thing with salad dressing, too.
[104:41.54]Give me the salad dressing on the side.
[104:42.54]Don't ever dress my salad for me.
[104:43.90]I will flip out.
[104:46.75]I will flip out, and I will fucking slap the thing down on the ground, and I will throw it behind my shoulder.
[104:53.39]MonkaS, psycho.
[105:01.08]Omegalo, privileged.
[105:04.96]Oh, that has salad dressing on it?
[105:06.72]Get it away from me!
[105:10.59]That's the ultimate, that's the ultimate, you spelt my name wrong on the Starbucks cup.
[105:15.43]Privileged asshole, right?
[105:16.75]Like, do I really care that much?
[105:18.73]Uh, my name is, uh, Jeremy, not, uh, Jeremy.
[105:25.86]Um, I don't know who the fuck that is.
[105:27.08]Alright, where am I going?
[105:31.24]Right, back to the peak.
[105:38.66]Jaren.
[105:40.76]I don't know why people get so bent out of shape about shit, man.
[105:43.60]Like, people get so mad and so annoyed over such little dumb things.
[105:59.89]Oh, like you.
[106:00.61]Yeah, like you.
[106:01.25]Like, you can't beat, like, a children's puzzle, so you curse out the developers of the video game.
[106:04.93]Fuck.
[106:06.09]Uh-oh.
[106:09.94]That's not the same.
[106:11.22]That's not the same.
[106:13.75]You don't like ketchup.
[106:14.57]You just want to rant about how gross ketchup was and like get it off my fucking bun.
[106:17.71]Let me do it myself.
[106:18.75]Yeah, but it's different though.
[106:19.69]It's different because it's me.
[106:21.19]Right?
[106:24.57]If it were you, I would say that you're an asshole.
[106:27.49]But if it's me, okay, it's me.
[106:29.54]So who doesn't?
[106:30.14]I don't.
[106:30.72]I'm not.
[106:31.88]No one can say anything to me.
[106:32.90]You know what's really sad?
[106:35.28]That's like why the world is so fucked up.
[106:42.40]Who the fuck are you?
[106:43.42]You shouldn't be here.
[106:45.16]It's not safe.
[106:46.48]You need to get off this mountain for the sake of your health and well-being.
[106:49.46]Trust me, I'm a doctor.
[106:51.81]Why is a dynamite strapped to you?
[106:54.77]What is that?
[106:56.81]If another earthquake strikes, it'll cause an avalanche.
[107:01.41]If you're up here when that happens, you'll be buried in snow.
[107:05.45]And if you don't die from blunt force trauma, you'll asphyxiate.
[107:14.11]I know you, you're Eggbell.
[107:17.03]Yes, you're that character in the Jerma985 universe that we brought back to kill to make sure he would never have to show up ever again in any form of future media.
[107:37.80]Where's Liz?
[107:38.50]What happened to her?
[107:39.47]Interview.
[107:40.31]How can I help?
[107:40.99]I hope nobody heard that.
[107:43.03]Oh, a real bad place to say that.
[107:45.87]In a giant echoing chasm where I can scream out here and it'll echo everywhere.
[107:52.83]Wait, follow... Oh, I have to follow you.

[130:42.89]It started at 60.
[130:45.57]But as you all know, the market is closed when the stream is offline.
[130:49.24]So, we hit 79.
[130:50.42]People are like, dude, 79, fuck you, it's better than that.
[130:53.56]Like, hold on a second here.
[130:56.32]The market's closed when the stream's off.
[130:59.96]We were still going up.
[131:02.40]And it took today.
[131:03.24]Okay, we started today.
[131:04.02]We're going to come down.
[131:05.04]We're going to pull back to like 77, 75 after that big jump.

[131:47.71]Neo.
[131:50.91]What the hell are you talking about?
[131:55.79]Like the Matrix?
[132:11.98]That was a donkey sound?
[132:13.30]Oh, excuse me.
[132:14.24]That was not a donkey sound.
[132:16.46]This is a donkey sound.
[132:20.71]No, that's one of those ducks at the store that you squeeze the dog toy.
[132:26.87]Never mind.
[132:27.61]I tried.
[132:28.03]It's a chew toy.
[132:38.51]Alright, rewind it.
[132:44.08]I'm a dog toy.
[132:45.10]I'm a grocery store dog toy or like a pet smart dog toy.
[132:52.73]Donate.
[132:54.23]Yeah, we're gonna donate all of them.
[132:56.65]Size of your heart has grown and so your inventory grows too.
[133:02.04]I do think... Okay, no more donating.
[133:04.70]I want to feed these two other... No, but then we get to look at them forever.
[133:18.77]Oh, I should have fed the instabug to somebody.
[133:23.25]What do you want?
[133:24.91]Heartless Straber begs chat for donations.
[133:28.75]Please!
[133:29.17]Please give me!
[133:29.65]That kind of matched up a little bit, but
[133:49.95]begging for donations I would I would honestly like I'll be real with you I would I would never do that what we have here is we have a a stream where I am broadcasting to you my financial responsibilities are not your financial responsibilities
[134:13.64]If I were to ever make my financial responsibilities your financial responsibilities and tell you that you have to pay for them would be... I find that would be pretty bad.
[134:30.07]You're in debt though.
[134:31.86]I'll be fine.
[134:34.38]What about the debt?
[134:38.92]Like if I... Okay, let's put it this way.
[134:40.32]If I wanted like a car, like a new car...
[134:44.27]Man, I was really thinking about getting, like, a new car, but... Oh, guys, like, if you could, like, do that, help me out here.
[134:49.92]Like... Why are you guys, like, sitting in your dorm, like, in a dorm room?

[138:52.37]Alright, so this, wait.
[138:54.18]Video diary two.
[138:55.00]Okay.
[139:09.26]Why is the audio so low?
[139:33.54]I just sit here all day while everybody else is out there all productive and happy.
[139:39.79]That's not true.
[139:41.11]You help me all the time.
[139:43.07]Like when I cut my paw.
[139:45.01]You only got hurt because you were getting snacks for me.
[139:47.59]I don't care about either of these characters.
[139:51.74]I'm just being honest.
[139:52.56]I don't care about anybody in this town.
[139:55.46]You were there when the world was laughing at me.
[139:58.68]You were there for me during the worst days of my life.
[140:08.85]I kind of like the little donation guy.
[140:12.03]And the funny mayor.
[140:17.27]Oh, and Wiggle.
[140:19.41]I like Wiggle.
[140:29.45]Who the hell is that?
[140:33.99]Is that the Bicentennial Man?
[140:39.21]No, no, what's the robot?
[140:40.63]What's the robot one?
[140:47.65]Hi, robot.
[140:50.41]No, no, no, no.
[140:51.55]Robots.
[140:52.05]It actually was called Robots.
[140:54.41]Yeah, the movie Robots.
[141:06.35]Those are you guys that are saying who the fuck is filming this?
[141:23.63]Don't put it past somebody that lives in this town to be walking around with a fucking camera and pointing it at everything.
[141:29.19]I've been doing it for the last seven or eight in-game hours.
[141:37.44]Every cutscene I've done this.
[141:39.30]So, is it really that hard to believe?
[141:42.38]Alright, well that's two films.
[141:48.78]I have another key.
[141:50.10]Or something.

[143:09.24]Who is taking the photos in this town?
[143:11.15]There's no way.
[143:11.75]Nobody does that.
[143:24.58]I'm filming the film right now.
[143:27.28]I don't know why.
[143:28.09]I thought there would be a better view.
[143:34.43]you're filming me filming the film that somebody else filmed like this this is piracy this is like okay that's the DVD I'm I'm like the torrent and you're like the person on the side of the road that sells this like you torrented the torrent and you're selling it in like these weird jewel DVD cases on the side of the road

[144:14.79]Which one is this one?
[144:15.45]Four?
[144:18.85]No, we already saw this movie.
[144:20.40]Turn it off.
[144:25.92]I'll rebuttal you.
[144:26.80]Alright, you want to do it again?
[144:29.40]Put it down.
[144:29.80]You take the first.
[144:30.64]Shoot me then.
[144:32.20]Shoot me.
[144:32.56]You won't do it.
[144:34.46]Everybody just relax.
[144:35.84]Relax, relax, relax.
[144:37.10]Put it down.
[144:37.98]Relax.
[144:39.45]It doesn't have to fucking end like this.
[144:42.83]I'll put mine down if you put yours down.
[144:44.49]Put it down.
[144:46.11]I'm putting my gun down here, okay?
[144:48.11]My camera.
[144:49.71]Alright.
[144:51.79]Okay.
[144:53.17]There we go.
[144:54.33]Now we can be civil.
[144:57.18]Oh!
[144:57.90]Ah!
[145:07.10]Double kill, god damn it.
[145:09.82]We both had the same idea.
[145:11.00]Tarantino.
[145:37.52]Why do they have normal bodies?
[145:44.22]There's no cinnamon buns on their noses and like hamburgers on their feet.
[145:47.82]This is before snacks.
[145:50.46]Oh.
[146:09.77]I thought she had the gun up.
[146:11.05]Why is she just pointing at me?
[146:13.95]Is it another gun?
[146:14.75]Oh, I wasn't prepared for that.
[146:31.31]What do you want?
[146:34.08]This is her house.
[146:34.90]Oh.
[146:35.38]No, it's not.
[146:35.94]This is not her house.
[146:36.48]This is like the movie theater.
[146:37.16]Find out what Cromdo does at midnight.
[146:39.42]Okay, I used all the keys.
[147:02.47]I don't care about what Chromdo does at midnight.
[147:04.15]I care about opening the secret door.
[147:06.44]Okay, Chandler would like to talk to you about something.
[147:13.98]Crack the code.
[147:14.66]Alright, I need to go to the Sizzling Shimmering Sizzler, or whatever it is.
[147:19.42]And we have to investigate the... That part that I... Remember I tried to look at it before?
[147:34.20]Yeah, we gotta cross the bridge at the crusty gorge to the sizzling shore.
[147:42.78]All these names are almost identical.
[147:44.50]Just open a thesaurus, you figure it out.
[147:57.51]Oh, okay.
[147:57.97]Here we go.
[148:00.59]There's a place that we have not been.
[148:04.50]I glazed over it.
[148:08.26]I didn't pick up the clue.
[148:09.02]I'm going to pick it up right now.
[148:13.45]What do you care about?
[148:14.85]What do you care about then?
[148:16.43]You are so negative today, Jerma.
[148:17.93]These bug people are just trying to live their best life and you always put them down.
[148:20.92]It's pathetic.
[148:28.06]Because I wanted to be a bug snatch catcher when I was younger, and I just didn't do it, alright?
[148:34.09]And watching these people do that, and I wanted it.
[148:36.95]I wanted that.
[148:41.11]Oh, I have to catch one of these.
[148:43.31]That's a dangerous one, though.
[148:44.23]That's a rare bug.
[148:49.64]We are in the right spot, right?
[148:53.02]Yeah.
[148:53.40]No, we're not.
[148:53.84]We need to go to Boiling Bay.
[148:55.50]How do I get to Boiling Bay?
[148:56.34]Okay.
[149:02.74]How do I get to Boiling Bay from here?
[149:07.80]Catch this guy first.
[149:08.70]Alright, how do I- what do I got?
[149:12.04]Large, aggressive, and destructive.
[149:14.24]It's afraid of the potato bugs things.
[149:18.36]It loves hot sauce and stuff.
[149:19.72]Okay.
[149:20.32]So, how do we put you out?
[149:22.06]Is there water anywhere over here?
[149:23.12]I don't think there's any water.
[149:29.81]How do I put you out?
[149:30.97]Does anybody here have water?
[149:32.87]Oh, there we go.
[149:33.35]Right here.
[149:33.57]Alright.
[149:35.55]Get off that.
[149:37.65]I need you over here.
[149:42.13]Hot sauce.
[149:45.23]Go get it.
[149:45.55]What do you think about that?
[149:51.12]And what do you think about this?
[149:52.12]I'm in the water now.
[149:55.80]Okay.
[149:56.46]Now we just... I mean, I'll take that for free.
[149:58.92]Now let's trip him.
[150:08.38]Did I get him?
[150:11.69]Nope, I didn't.
[150:15.49]Get over here.
[150:18.05]Fuck, why did you exploded?
[150:20.77]What the hell?
[150:23.75]What is that?
[150:25.56]A cockroach.
[150:31.66]Wait, I could just pick him up.
[150:33.78]I could have just picked him up.
[150:37.95]As long as it's under the sand.
[150:39.05]Oh.
[150:44.46]Who just kicked his ass?
[150:45.24]Alright.
[150:46.06]This is... I gotta get this right.
[150:48.46]I'm gonna set this up.
[150:49.64]We're gonna do a... A home alone trap here.
[150:54.69]So, let's get this in the right place.
[151:02.57]No, I need a good spot for this.
[151:04.99]That might be okay.
[151:05.59]Alright, that's gonna be...
[151:09.40]Never mind.
[151:20.97]There we go.
[151:21.51]Alright.
[151:22.21]Now we're going to get you to follow me over here.
[151:25.97]With hot sauce.
[151:27.71]We'll roll the hot sauce on you.
[151:39.02]Hey, come get me, you big alien!
[151:41.36]Told you that story, right?
[151:52.17]When I went to Disney World, and there was that scary ride with the alien.
[151:56.93]It was actually a terrifying experience.
[151:58.84]Was it like Epcot?
[152:00.66]It was called like The Alien or something.
[152:02.34]Alien Encounter.
[152:07.31]I've told that story before, yeah, where I put my thumbs in my eyes.
[152:11.63]No, I put my pinkies on my eyes and my thumbs in my ears.
[152:14.88]To make sure I didn't see or hear anything the whole ride.
[152:16.92]And then when it got like, it gets like pitch black.
[152:20.18]Before the alien breaks out.
[152:22.52]And right when it got pitch black, my brother said, Come over here, you big stupid alien!
[152:28.61]And I remember just, I heard it kind of muffled through my enclosure I had.
[152:32.35]And I was like, don't say that, man!
[152:34.01]Don't say that, he's gonna come over here!
[152:35.35]Why would you do that?! !
[152:48.34]Omega little baby.
[152:49.30]Yeah, I was eight.
[152:51.32]I was eight years old.
[152:56.59]Get off.
[152:58.31]Get off of this now.
[153:01.69]Last year.
[153:05.31]Get down.
[153:07.68]I'm gonna get you.
[153:10.10]I'm gonna get you.
[153:11.68]Ouch.
[153:13.22]Ouch.
[153:14.58]Ouch.
[153:18.04]I wish I could- I wanna play that so bad.
[153:23.18]Why won't you get off?
[153:29.19]I'll just steal your egg then.
[153:30.13]Oh, there goes your egg!
[153:45.61]I don't know.
[153:46.27]He won't come down.
[153:47.55]I need to launch him off.
[153:54.04]Hey, look at me.
[153:55.02]I'm so scary.
[153:59.56]You dummy.
[154:00.18]Alright, now get over here.
[154:03.24]Right into my trap.
[154:05.46]Good, good, good, good.
[154:06.96]Right in here.
[154:08.14]Oh, no.
[154:08.80]I'm in the water.
[154:09.96]Look out.
[154:11.01]Where'd he go?
[154:14.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this way.
[154:15.79]No, no, no, no, no, this way, this way.
[154:17.25]Okay, no, no, no, no, no, this way, this way, this way, this way.
[154:19.85]Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me.
[154:21.99]What?
[154:23.29]What?
[154:42.22]I just stole that.
[154:44.62]I got a cockroach.
[154:50.18]Any more of those or did I fuck the whole thing up?
[154:53.84]Although, excuse me.
[154:55.80]Your favorite sauce is hot sauce.
[154:58.36]We're going to get you to dive bomb this.
[154:59.54]What do you think about that?
[155:17.82]Something down here.
[155:23.77]Bridge handle?
[155:25.09]Wait.
[155:28.79]Is this done like a shortcut?
[155:32.64]I bet I could use the snack grabber on this.
[155:36.52]I bet you could.
[155:39.42]Cool.
[155:43.19]Wait a minute.
[155:46.48]Any of the... What's that?
[155:47.88]A unique Razzby.
[155:51.24]It will need help escaping the underground.
[155:56.34]Okay.
[155:57.70]I can do that.
[156:05.40]Oh.
[156:06.22]Well, I'll just get you.
[156:14.41]Black Razzberry.
[156:15.55]Nice.
[156:18.03]Is there anything else down here that I haven't gotten?
[156:21.69]Ooh!
[156:24.15]A hall of scorpions.
[156:27.55]What's that?
[156:29.12]That looks like it could be broken by something.
[156:35.82]I don't know what that means.
[156:40.26]I do know what that means.
[156:47.13]Where the hell is this?
[156:50.95]A hall of scorpions.
[156:53.43]Oh, shit.
[156:54.17]I'm about to collapse this whole thing.
[157:00.44]What does that do for me?
[157:01.56]Oh.
[157:02.76]Uh... I mean, that's... I guess that's kind of cool.
[157:26.04]Nobody touch that.
[157:28.92]Okay, you.
[157:31.97]You.
[157:33.27]Follow me.
[157:39.37]Got him.
[157:46.19]Got him.
[157:50.36]I want that thing, too.
[157:51.72]I want a scorpion.
[157:52.34]I want a scorpion.
[157:54.80]Okay, so you lurks invisibly and... I got a free pancake!
[158:22.08]I want that.
[158:22.66]That's the ultimate prize.
[158:24.04]The supreme moth pizza.
[158:31.69]Alright, I need to go... Where's the... Go back down here for a second.
[158:37.39]I feel like I missed a few things down here.
[158:38.61]Because I could go this way or I could go that way.
[158:45.20]Yep.
[158:52.13]Alright, I'm up top.
[158:56.37]No.
[158:57.51]Is there anything else to do here?
[159:07.38]No.
[159:11.70]No.
[159:13.50]You're desecrating ancient artifacts.
[159:17.19]It's a long way to save rocks.
[159:22.44]I want the cheese.
[159:22.90]I want the cheese puff.
[159:30.29]There were rocks.
[159:31.61]That wasn't an artifact.
[159:33.13]I didn't desecrate the scorpion things.
[159:35.10]I desecrated the rocks.
[159:37.14]There was just a bunch of... Wait, I didn't desecrate anything.
[159:39.26]Let's be clear.
[159:40.78]There were no desecrations.
[159:54.09]I'm an opportunist.
[160:00.23]Oh, what's this?
[160:05.32]This pyramid is just rocks.
[160:06.72]No, the pyramid is a pyramid.
[160:08.50]That was, there were clearly just rocks in the way that I blew up the rocks.
[160:12.02]This is where I need to go.
[160:23.83]That's a little shortcut.
[160:24.71]Okay, right here.
[160:25.41]Remember this?
[160:27.29]I do.
[160:27.57]Already got these.
[160:31.02]Alright, so now I gotta go to the bottom of this place.
[160:33.44]There's a little beach.
[160:35.32]Pick up the clue.
[160:36.32]It's down here.
[160:40.31]Love you, by the way.
[160:41.35]Love you.
[160:44.23]Down here.
[160:51.24]Alright.
[160:52.66]Here it is.
[160:53.06]I already got it.
[160:55.08]Yeah, we... but... We told you that an hour ago, but... um... We told you it was the other half of the code, the paper.
[161:28.82]Okay.
[161:30.02]But how do I get a third person up there?
[161:35.30]I need to interview people.
[161:36.76]Oh.
[161:40.74]You must investigate and do interviews.
[161:43.17]Didn't I interview everybody already?
[161:44.47]Who have I not interviewed?
[161:51.85]I need to get Sheldah.
[161:54.81]This lady wants cheese sauce.
[161:56.57]Where am I supposed to get cheese sauce?
[162:08.33]At Cheese Bay.
[162:12.93]You know, I have not picked up one of these guys yet.
[162:16.14]Very elusive.
[162:22.30]It's literally adjacent to her.
[162:23.98]Oh.
[162:26.76]Well, I don't have time for that.
[162:30.90]You get it from Chuck E. Cheese.
[162:33.22]You know Chuck E. Cheese is a fun thing to say, doesn't it?
[162:35.54]When you say the word Chuck E. Cheese, don't you think of a gross microwaved pizza?
[162:40.89]I just think of a pizza, like a cheesy, gross pizza.
[162:44.19]Chuck E. Cheese.
[162:48.67]It's the C-H followed by the C-H, you know, like Chuck E. Cheese.
[163:01.03]I've got lots of donations to give.
[163:04.33]And who have I not interviewed?
[163:05.85]I don't want to do any work for you.
[163:08.67]Who has not had an interview?
[163:10.75]These two haven't been interviewed, right?
[163:12.15]For a second, I was like, when did I feed this lady black olives?
[163:16.38]Those are just glasses.
[163:25.52]What did I?
[163:25.84]I don't know.
[163:26.70]Green Meathead?
[163:27.02]This is a minion.
[163:51.33]It is a minion.
[163:51.85]Okay.
[163:52.15]Let's interview one of the last two people we didn't interview.
[163:54.52]This game is really interesting because I could see where it was sort of created.
[164:00.42]It's like you're in the bath.
[164:01.34]This person was in the bathtub.
[164:21.08]and they were just, like, kind of, like, kind of falling asleep in the bathtub and they're just, like, eating bugs that are food-based and you turn into Muppets with bugs for food.
[164:31.12]I'm gonna make it.
[164:31.70]Let's go.
[164:32.24]I think I'm, uh, that's a great idea.
[164:38.69]Redacted.
[164:39.79]That's dangerous.
[164:42.27]I don't mean, like, I don't mean sleeping in a bathtub.
[164:46.79]I mean, like, you're just chilling.
[164:49.15]Redacted.
[165:04.55]Do I talk like that?
[165:06.55]I feel like I talk like that.
[165:07.89]Sometimes I get self-conscious.
[165:09.87]Do I do that?
[165:12.67]I probably do sometimes.
[165:13.82]Not all the time though.
[165:15.44]John Oliver.
[165:23.99]I'm so glad you asked.
[165:25.53]I believe there may be... No, it's not John Oliver.
[165:27.24]...located on this very island hidden somewhere deep underground.
[165:31.20]I have charts.
[165:32.00]Let me show you my charts later.
[165:35.19]I want to do it so bad.
[165:35.99]I don't.
[165:36.27]I don't.
[165:36.69]Stop interviewing this nerd and catch some bugs.
[165:39.93]I have to interview the nerd so then one of the nerds will follow me up the mountain and stand on a plate for me.
[165:44.68]So I can open the door to go in.
[165:46.82]I made that joke twice recently.
[166:04.99]What joke?
[166:05.65]I don't?
[166:05.99]John Oliver reference?
[166:06.65]Can chat interview you?
[166:07.61]Sure, ask me something.
[166:08.20]Who are you?
[166:08.48]My name is Jeremy Elbertson.
[166:37.83]Do I eat ass?
[166:40.35]Redacted.
[166:40.91]Why are you pretending to like this game?
[166:58.30]You're not using the chart correctly.
[167:00.95]This is important stuff.
[167:01.81]Hold on.
[167:01.99]There it is.
[167:02.29]There it is.
[167:24.29]Um, you guys are reading the Jerma985 streaming chart incorrectly.
[167:31.63]If I stream a video game more than once, that means that I like it.
[167:39.60]If you see a video game that is streamed more than one time,
[167:46.67]It means I found it to be worth doing again.
[167:49.65]Saw.
[167:50.65]Well, here's the thing about Saw.
[167:52.74]I was, I was like self-bullied into playing Saw again.
[167:56.48]And beating it because... Um, I got Saw 2.
[167:59.98]I already like bought it.
[168:00.90]I like already ordered it.
[168:04.30]And Halloween was coming up.
[168:06.16]So I just, I had to.
[168:12.55]And I didn't notice how I didn't do any more of Saw 2.
[168:18.31]I did saw one.
[168:19.79]Alright, let's finish saw one because saw two, here comes Halloween.
[168:23.16]Never playing this fucking game ever again.
[168:28.62]Alright, let's, I want to, no donations for a little while.
[168:31.42]I want to feed, I want to do some interesting builds.
[168:38.22]Who do I want to keep?
[168:38.90]Okay, I'll keep a soad ED.
[168:40.54]I'll keep a loaded spud.
[168:43.84]I need the praying mantis for a reason, right?
[168:47.36]What's the reason?
[168:50.54]Somebody wants this, don't they?
[168:59.69]Okay, a gramble.
[169:00.47]Right.
[169:00.69]Donate a praying picantus.
[169:03.73]Here we go.
[169:05.39]He's huge.
[169:05.87]Alright, there you go.
[169:07.27]I did it.
[169:08.63]He's huge.
[169:08.97]He needs his own pen.
[169:20.71]He needs his own pen.
[169:36.52]What's the context of this?
[169:41.81]I remember doing this, but I don't remember what the context was.
[169:48.73]Why is the hat the same?
[169:55.57]It's like the same person.
[169:58.41]That's creepy.
[169:59.93]I don't like that picture.
[170:08.44]Wrong link?
[170:11.40]That's not the wrong link.
[170:13.80]Okay, let's go.
[170:15.28]I gotta pee really bad.
[170:16.42]Does it gramble later?
[170:21.16]Wait, are we breeding insect food?
[170:25.74]I'll be right back.
[170:26.16]I'm going to sleep in your bed for a minute.
[170:40.25]Alright now, Manny.
[170:42.17]Just follow the pointer.
[170:44.65]Why am I leaving?
[170:45.21]Wait.
[170:46.75]Come back.
[170:47.75]Manny.
[170:48.71]No, no.
[170:49.23]You opened up the pen.
[170:50.05]They're all running away.
[170:50.85]What did you do?
[170:53.31]You left me.
[170:56.72]That hat, man.
[170:57.30]It's fucking me up.
[170:58.15]It's the same hat.
[170:58.97]It's the same person.
[170:59.91]We have to go wrangle all these back again.
[171:01.65]I hope not.
[171:26.68]Are they terrorizing the town?
[171:29.10]Alright, I gotta go pee.
[171:30.62]Let me take a quick break.
[171:31.26]I'll be right back.
[175:45.30]I think it would be kind of funny if I were to come back from the break here and unpause the game and the whole place is just being attacked and on fire and shit.
[176:03.52]Alright, um... Is he just locking himself in his house?
[176:07.20]I don't get it.
[176:11.34]Oh, we don't need to find?
[176:12.42]Does he not care anymore?
[176:15.46]All the animals escaped.
[176:17.64]Where are we?
[176:19.54]In the middle of... What's wrong with you?
[176:26.19]What happened to your teeth?
[176:27.01]Oh, right.
[176:29.33]Foil.
[176:31.27]Okay, let's continue what I was doing.
[176:33.03]I shouldn't even... Donation campaign?
[176:35.89]Oh.
[176:37.51]But I don't... I can't... This is open.
[176:41.12]I'm not going to donate them.
[176:42.18]I'd rather eat them.
[176:45.70]If I look, they're gonna run away.
[176:55.11]Should I?
[176:55.53]P-Song or Riot.
[176:59.65]There's no P-Song.
[177:04.11]Sup, bro?
[177:10.79]Okay, I have... Let me see the map.
[177:17.31]Near the mountain peak, hang left from the trail and take a narrow ledge north.
[177:21.81]It's the attached map.
[177:24.38]The pressure plates won't activate.
[177:26.50]I think the ancient grumpuses need to be fed first, but what do they like to eat?
[177:37.12]Okay, near the mountain peak, hang left from the trail and take a narrow ledge north.
[177:40.96]See you later.
[177:46.76]Riot, riot, riot, riot, riot, riot.
[177:49.04]That's fine.
[177:52.65]You can riot all you want.
[177:53.67]You're not getting a... You are not getting a... When we use the toilet.
[177:58.99]We... No, we're not doing that.
[178:00.57]I am not doing that.
[178:01.55]That's why I'm drawing a line there for real.
[178:08.68]Not getting any more than that.
[178:20.06]There's like a company that just makes a variation of the same song with 3D animated characters.
[178:30.08]It's like, baby eats vegetables!
[178:32.22]And it's like, peas, peas, baby eats the peas.
[178:36.67]Yum, yum, yum, I eat them up, the peas.
[178:40.99]And they replace words, and they just kind of change a little bit of the animation.
[178:44.43]And they have a billion views each.
[178:50.67]Johnny do do do do do I was real okay I gotta be honest with you during the Johnny dude to do arc of like meme ability from like a year or two ago I sat there I watched dozens and dozens and dozens of like weird children's song videos and they made me laugh
[179:16.60]During, like, the Johnny Doot-Doo-Doo joke that everybody thought was so funny, I was like, you know what?
[179:21.32]What else is out there?
[179:30.78]I think some of you guys underestimate just the kind of shit that I do.
[179:35.18]Last night, I watched a compilation of woodcutting videos.
[179:41.10]Just people splitting wood and just cutting wood.
[179:45.67]Just like, I'm like, yeah, that's nice.
[179:49.26]I don't know, just because I felt like it.
[179:55.34]Okay, here we go.
[179:56.08]The ledge up north.
[179:57.38]Here it is.
[180:03.95]Found it.
[180:04.51]Alright.
[180:04.87]The gods like to eat food.
[180:09.29]I haven't figured out anything.
[180:11.33]Oh, my grump.
[180:12.17]Where'd you find this?
[180:14.98]Good work.
[180:16.09]I know what you mean, yesterday I watched some guy play Bugsnax.
[180:18.93]Okay.
[180:40.64]I wish I could just say yes.
[180:42.22]Please do that.
[180:42.81]I don't care.
[180:43.57]Do it.
[180:44.27]Activate three bug statues.
[180:52.97]Alright.
[180:53.43]What do you represent?
[180:55.90]What did I feed you?
[180:57.44]I didn't even click anything.
[180:59.06]Oh.
[181:00.06]Okay.
[181:00.62]You represent... This looks like a cookie.
[181:04.72]You represent cookies!
[181:07.09]Um...
[181:09.16]You... ...represent... I don't know.
[181:16.35]You represent Marshmallow, uh, Haburger's stuff.
[181:19.67]I don't know.
[181:21.13]You're ignoring a raid.
[181:22.59]Is that what a raid came in?
[181:27.02]Master Gear!
[181:31.16]Sing the raid song.
[181:36.14]I don't even remember what the raid song is.
[181:38.34]Raid.
[181:39.46]Raid.
[181:40.40]Thank you for the raid.
[181:42.52]One, two, three.
[181:43.70]You eat it up.
[181:44.83]You see.
[181:46.45]Peas.
[181:47.43]Peas.
[181:48.35]Thank you for the peas.
[181:52.15]It's a raid.
[181:53.35]Do do do do do do.
[181:54.77]It's a raid.
[181:55.73]Do do do do do do.
[181:58.79]I don't know what to feed these fucking people.
[182:00.43]You want ice cream sandwiches.
[182:01.57]You want hamburgers.
[182:02.51]You want cookies.
[182:06.37]I don't have any of these.
[182:13.11]You want... Bread?
[182:17.94]Ice cream?
[182:18.52]I think I have ice cream.
[182:19.82]How do I not have any of the things anybody wants?
[182:21.74]This is definitely... You're a cookie.
[182:28.43]Chippy stat... Oh.
[182:31.19]Scoopy statue.
[182:33.99]Flutter jam statue.
[182:37.51]Stoodler statue.
[182:38.77]A so- um, Sody statue.
[182:42.71]And a Chilly Nilly statue.
[182:45.49]Do I have- I think I have a Sody.
[182:47.23]Oh, I do!
[182:47.71]I have a Sody.
[182:51.92]But this is a Mount Sody, though.
[182:56.50]Alright.
[182:59.74]We need to... Somebody remember those.

[183:03.72]We need a Scoopy.
[183:04.70]We need a Chippy.
[183:06.30]We need a Jammy.
[183:09.30]We need a Chili.
[183:10.72]We need a Soty.
[183:12.22]And we need a Stewie.
[183:14.06]That kind of looks like Stewie.
[183:15.72]That looks like Stewie.
[183:17.42]I'd say, right?
[183:25.39]Okay, let's go.
[183:27.65]You only need three.
[183:28.51]Yes, so whatever I find first.
[183:36.93]Worst joke 2020.
[183:38.03]You can't just say everything is the worst joke 2020.
[183:41.59]Wait, that's a scoopy.
[183:42.45]No, that's a scoopy banana pea.
[183:44.79]Not the same thing.
[183:46.11]Don't... Wait, here's a Mountain Dew.
[183:48.83]Mountain Dew, I got you.
[183:49.83]Come on out.
[183:54.13]It hates all sauce, right?
[183:56.17]You're gonna hate that, aren't you?
[184:00.29]Wait, cover the sauce.
[184:02.73]Cover the ball in sauce.
[184:03.49]Come get it.
[184:08.99]What a moron.
[184:10.55]Moron.
[184:12.35]Oops, I forgot.
[184:13.33]I forgot I had to catch you.
[184:27.02]There's one.
[184:28.26]Alright, now I need a Scoopy.
[184:29.88]A regular Scoopy.
[184:32.22]Not any weird Scoopy.
[184:33.44]Worst game 2020.
[184:34.46]Alright, now actually ban that person.
[184:36.68]For life.
[184:43.67]For life.
[184:46.49]You know what?
[184:46.93]Triple life sentence.
[184:54.33]Alright, I need a Scoopy.
[184:55.65]Wait, there's a Stewie up here, too.
[184:57.99]Whoa!
[185:00.35]I need- Oh, there's a Chippy!
[185:02.45]Get back here!
[185:06.50]I'm gonna get two in here.
[185:07.30]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[185:13.54]This is it.
[185:13.96]If I get these two, it's over.
[185:16.32]You need a Poopy, too.
[185:18.52]No such thing as a Poopy.
[185:19.32]Alright, there's the Chippy.
[185:21.40]That's his route.
[185:24.12]He's coming right at me.
[185:25.46]Wait, hold on.
[185:26.32]He's coming.
[185:26.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[185:34.54]Okay.
[185:36.91]Now I gotta get you.
[185:40.43]Stew, you hate... You love hot sauce, so we're gonna do the same thing.
[185:44.77]Here we go.
[185:47.37]The ball?
[185:48.67]Where's the ball?
[185:49.29]Oh.
[185:56.50]okay let's bring you to the cold is it weird that I'm jealous that I didn't get to do every single voice in this game
[186:26.18]If I could go back in time and do every single character in this game, I would want to.
[186:30.08]No, not the ones that talk, though.
[186:31.20]No, fuck that.
[186:31.64]I don't want to do that.
[186:32.34]I'm talking about the weird animal bugs.
[186:36.15]Foods.
[186:36.67]That's what I want.
[186:37.17]I don't want to be the people talking.
[186:38.99]I want to be these things.
[186:39.71]Alright, where's the, uh... What's a cream cheese bug?
[186:49.31]There we go.
[186:49.79]There's a bobsicle.
[186:51.62]Now you're in trouble.
[187:01.85]Yeah, so anyway, in the DLC, when they have like Bagel and Lux, could I be like, Luxy, Luxy, Luxy?
[187:10.53]Come on, and put like a little filter on that.
[187:12.04]They can just use that for free.
[187:19.10]Luxy, Luxy, Luxy.
[187:22.74]That's for free.
[187:23.86]Just use it if you want.
[187:24.70]You can use it if you want to.
[187:25.42]You don't have to pay me.
[187:26.68]I don't care.
[187:27.03]Okay.
[187:35.37]No, let me do it again.
[187:38.55]Do over, do over.
[187:43.31]That's better.
[187:51.98]That was Mortal Kombat.
[187:52.98]That wasn't worse?
[187:53.88]How was that worse?
[187:56.08]Fine, I'll do one more.
[187:56.96]You can use any one you want.
[188:01.55]Loxy!
[188:03.49]Loxy!
[188:05.05]Loxy!
[188:10.01]Oops.
[188:14.27]How is that worse?
[188:15.87]No, you're distracting me.
[188:16.74]Stop distracting me.
[188:17.52]All of you, leave.
[188:24.74]Get back here.
[188:25.36]I need an icicle.
[188:29.32]All of you, leave.
[188:31.72]Please don't.
[188:32.30]Please don't.
[188:34.34]Will he go in the water?
[188:35.10]Wait, I know how to get him in the water.
[188:41.49]What am I doing?
[188:59.46]Stoodler, move!
[189:15.52]We got it!
[189:26.11]I say you got it.
[189:28.27]You're a sellout.
[189:30.25]Wait, did you not hear what I said?
[189:31.75]Just use it for free?
[189:33.92]I don't... How is it a sellout?
[189:37.08]Alright, where's Stoodler?
[189:37.96]Alright, Stoodler.
[189:42.08]Stoodler.
[189:45.33]That's a Stoodler, right?
[189:46.15]Okay.
[189:48.13]Stoodler.
[189:49.31]Delicious.
[189:52.05]This is a... Yeah, Mount Sody.
[189:58.22]This one was a... I don't have a Chili Nilly.
[190:03.26]It's a Chippy right here.
[190:05.52]That's it.
[190:10.33]you're okay you are okay right blood has been spilled drowsiness numbness or missing limbs sorry don't mind me I got the rest of the snacks oh you got the other ones okay that helps next she says oh she says we need three grumpuses to do the final oh we don't know any other grumpuses it's just us this mountain is unstable
[190:38.26]I don't think there's like ten people back at home.
[190:39.44]We could pay two strawberries to come up here.
[190:40.82]Alright, Philbo.
[190:41.18]We're gonna bring Philbo.
[190:41.92]We're gonna sacrifice Philbo.
[191:13.80]Can't we just put a big rock up here?
[191:15.02]I don't understand.
[191:17.38]There's only three plates.
[191:19.22]You're telling me you can't just pick up this snowman and put him over there?
[191:25.39]Why?
[191:26.77]Just take a bunch of these rocks and put them over there.
[191:29.45]We need three people?
[191:31.64]This makes no sense.
[191:33.68]It's completely unrealistic and this game really needs to dial back some of the cartoon bullshit.
[191:40.98]More realism.
[191:45.68]Roo.
[191:48.77]Roo.
[191:53.73]Oh, what's wrong with my fish?
[191:55.56]Okay, my fish is fine.
[191:59.72]Let's go talk to Philbo.
[192:00.44]Philbo?
[192:10.30]You're asking for realism in a game where you eat bugs.
[192:12.92]See you in a hundred years where that's the number one source of protein for humans.
[192:25.55]Just saying.
[192:32.35]I will not eat the bugs.
[192:36.77]You won't even really think about it, will you?
[192:39.25]It'll be ground up.
[192:41.53]Turned into a patty.
[192:42.47]A bunch of sauces and flavorings added to it.
[192:46.63]You won't even care.
[192:48.31]Alright, Bilbo.
[192:55.51]I need you.
[193:00.10]I know where Lizbert is.
[193:02.36]really oh buddy say no more I am there let's go bugs are literally land seafood bugs are literally land seafood I don't understand this is a this is this is a big mountain huh a lot of a lot of steps
[193:29.34]Grump, I knew this was a bad idea.
[193:31.37]I'm fine, really.
[193:35.61]Beyond bugs.
[193:37.75]Yeah.
[193:38.53]We'll eat too many bugs, and then we'll have to make fake bug meat.
[193:43.26]200 years from now, people will be so shocked at how much like the real thing beyond bug tastes like.
[193:48.90]Calm down, you'll hyperventilate.
[193:51.58]Oh, okay.
[193:52.82]Okay, yeah.
[193:56.53]Are you coming back to Snatchburg?
[193:59.13]I can't believe it's not bugs.
[194:01.69]This is not like my typical bug spread.
[194:03.31]I can tell the difference.
[194:14.76]Shut the fuck up, Grandpa.
[194:16.02]Get with the times.
[194:16.68]I can't sprint.
[194:17.10]I can't sprint.
[194:17.87]I can't sprint.
[194:18.45]Is this...
[194:44.53]Why can I still hear them?
[195:00.64]Fuck.
[195:01.18]They're waiting for me.
[195:02.10]I want to get in front of them quick.
[195:04.42]Let me get in front of them by at least a large enough margin where I can launch one of them off the cliff.
[195:07.94]I've wanted to do it for like the last two hours.
[195:09.34]Let me get in front of them and go a little bit faster, please.
[195:12.06]Please!
[195:12.66]Oh!
[195:12.84]She didn't.
[195:13.60]Two of her friends came in with her.
[195:41.28]And they had to make a choice.
[195:45.10]You figure it out.
[195:46.72]Lizbert's still there.
[195:48.64]Still alive.
[195:50.78]With a bunch of red stains around her mouth.
[195:54.67]You figure it out.
[195:59.45]This is it.
[196:00.99]Ready?
[196:02.35]One.
[196:03.51]Two.
[196:04.84]Three.
[196:05.18]Ah!
[196:12.78]Holy shit, that almost crushed his head.
[196:14.06]That was close.
[196:15.20]Oh, grump.
[196:16.50]I could have killed us all.
[196:18.54]What did I do wrong?
[196:19.44]Hey, hey, it's okay, Agabelle.
[196:22.41]That was kind of scary, but we're fine.
[196:25.07]We'll just try it again and... No, I'll try it again.
[196:28.89]You two are going home.
[196:30.59]What?
[196:30.77]Agabelle, I want to find Lisbert just as badly as you do.
[196:34.69]You don't have to do this alone.
[196:37.06]Yes, I do.
[196:38.78]I'm a burden to everybody around me.
[196:41.48]That's why she's gone.
[196:44.12]What do you mean?
[196:44.82]I was being stupid.
[196:47.52]And I slipped up on the cliffs while I was trying to show off.
[196:51.53]The earthquake hit and I was going to fall, but Liz saved me.
[196:55.13]Like she always does.
[196:57.73]She got swept away and then the ground opened beneath her and it swallowed her up.
[197:04.57]I'm so sorry.
[197:05.74]That would have been really great for you to tell me this like six hours ago.
[197:09.09]Please just go.
[197:11.05]I can't stand to see anyone else hurt.
[197:15.11]You know, when I was looking for Lisburg... Instead of finding little clues and hints on little map markings.
[197:21.40]So I tried eating this purple flower.
[197:23.40]She died in an earthquake.
[197:25.42]And then I went for a bit and then I fell in a hole.
[197:29.72]And by the time I dragged myself out of there, I was so tired and hungry I could barely move.
[197:36.51]I have a jacket, by the way.
[197:37.17]We've been out here for a long time.
[198:06.53]Then we'll find Liz together.
[198:09.68]Thank you, Philbo.
[198:11.64]Stay safe.
[198:17.62]Oh, my God.
[198:19.14]No, no, no, no, no.
[198:20.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[198:32.63]I killed him.
[198:33.39]I killed him.
[198:33.97]I killed that fucking guy.
[198:35.25]I killed him.
[198:35.85]I got him.
[198:41.57]I got him.
[198:44.05]I killed the mayor.
[198:44.77]That means I'm the mayor now.
[198:51.24]He thought it was fun.
[198:52.08]Oh, shit.
[199:05.69]He's gonna die down there.
[199:21.32]Quick, remove the evidence.
[199:22.56]You're right.
[199:25.07]Destroy.
[199:25.35]Destroy.
[199:38.78]You should have taken a picture of him.
[199:46.76]Alright, so now what?
[199:51.54]Big story.
[199:52.20]Oh, I need to... Alright, I'm missing two interviews.
[199:55.60]I gotta get cheese for this lady.
[199:57.06]Alright, let's go get cheese for this lady.
[200:19.88]Sometimes I dream about cheese.
[200:24.24]Me too.
[200:28.32]This coffee is garbage.
[200:32.56]You gotta get better coffee then, man.
[200:37.57]Grind your own beans.
[200:39.53]And like percolate the coffee for like four hours.
[200:42.37]That's worth it.
[200:49.30]He's back.
[200:49.74]Alright, cheese for the cheese lady.
[201:12.72]Now, really good coffee is awesome.
[201:14.48]I agree.
[201:14.80]The problem with really good coffee is... It really just is kind of a pain in the ass.
[201:20.76]I don't... The grinding beans right from the bean factory, whatever, and then grinding them up, getting the hot pour over it.
[201:28.84]I don't... I just want the caffeine.
[201:30.98]And, like, it's nice to have some.
[201:32.90]If you go to a restaurant for it, like a nice cappuccino at a restaurant or espresso from, like, a nice coffee place, I love it.
[201:37.96]I do.
[201:39.26]But I don't do that shit at my house.
[201:42.96]Alright, where is she?
[201:50.43]If you can make your own cold brew, that's good too.
[201:51.79]It's easy.
[201:57.75]Get the free ground.
[201:58.59]Good shit.
[201:59.07]Yeah, you can put it in a cup.
[202:00.11]That's fine.
[202:00.63]Putting it in a cup.
[202:01.13]But I'm talking about the people that really want to.
[202:03.60]You get the beans out.
[202:04.52]You grind them.
[202:05.82]And you do the slow pour over type stuff.
[202:09.68]That's too much for me.
[202:10.90]I want to open my mouth and just fucking drink it.
[202:14.83]Alright, where's the cheese lady?
[202:23.06]I thought that if this was the cheese, I was going to be so mad.
[202:25.94]Alright, where's this cheese?
[202:30.94]You want a cheeser?
[202:31.78]Within the great maw of stone.
[202:43.32]Yellow sauce in the maw of stone.
[202:47.00]Where's that?
[202:48.41]The temple?
[202:57.55]It's right there.
[203:22.01]How do I get it?
[203:44.73]Here's your cheese.
[203:52.81]Consider the sandscape a reflection of mine.
[203:57.53]One unable to escape its dry embrace.
[204:02.40]First, an act of rebirth.
[204:05.00]To break out of my current shelter.
[204:09.04]So too must you break.
[204:11.88]Shells, crack open the egglers.
[204:15.62]You and you alone.
[204:22.47]That was hard to do.
[204:23.61]My throat hurts after that.
[204:29.38]A crack.
[204:29.96]Two egglers.
[204:32.24]Wait.
[204:33.16]Where are those?
[204:41.00]What do you want?
[204:41.44]An active reaper.
[204:43.88]To break out of my current shelter.
[204:47.92]So too must you break.
[204:50.88]I don't know what those are.
[204:56.48]Where is there?
[204:57.19]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[204:58.47]I know what those are.
[204:59.45]These.
[205:00.15]Crack them open.
[205:00.97]Alright.
[205:01.29]Crack these.
[205:01.79]How do you crack an egg?
[205:12.44]Will you crack this?
[205:14.00]Crack that.
[205:18.27]Oops.
[205:19.87]Okay, it worked.
[205:22.29]Wait, come back!
[205:30.09]Wait, I need to scan you.
[205:35.65]Eggler.
[205:35.99]Without a shell, this egg makes for an easy meal.
[205:38.37]Loves hot sauce.
[205:39.67]Oh, me too.
[205:40.69]On eggs.
[205:41.43]Tabasco on eggs is incredible.
[205:46.10]Hold on, I got you.
[205:56.79]Yeah, Tabasco on eggs is unbelievable.
[206:07.15]Tabasco on anything is... Tabasco on a tuna sandwich is... I almost said based.
[206:11.53]Like, goddammit.
[206:12.35]You guys are just fucking inside my head again.
[206:15.11]Um... Tabasco on a tuna sandwich is really good.
[206:18.41]Tabasco on eggs is really good.
[206:19.65]Tabasco on pizza is also very good, too.
[206:28.16]Hey, open this one.
[206:28.86]Thank you.
[206:36.61]Almost had it.
[206:40.89]Yes, preach.
[206:52.24]Okay.
[206:57.06]This game's edible Pokémon.
[206:58.81]Yes it is.
[206:59.57]This edible ain't shit.
[207:01.19]Yeah.
[207:01.65]See you in an hour.
[207:03.75]When you've melted into the couch.
[207:27.13]Oh, I broke... Break two... Alright, I already did it.
[207:29.79]Please, Jerma, I worked hard on this.
[207:32.21]I... I wonder if you did.
[207:58.69]How did you do this?
[207:59.76]This is very fast.
[208:01.27]This is not even 10 minutes ago.
[208:20.63]That was like five minutes ago.
[208:22.37]It was pretty good for five minutes.
[208:23.53]It was great for five minutes.
[208:25.63]Look at the detail in the clouds back there.
[208:28.39]That alone would have taken me ten minutes.
[208:29.82]There's another one.
[208:32.78]Alright, what is it?
[208:38.72]You guys in the make the person fat filter and make the person old filter, you guys love these so much.
[208:48.94]You can't get enough of them.
[208:59.61]I look like a bird.
[209:17.81]a Dark Souls character yes and they definitely talk like this oh how are you I see your hollow I am as well seek the key to the room seek it well
[209:49.99]Every Dark Souls character, for some reason, they just have a wheeze laugh at the end of every sentence.
[210:03.86]Fashion 1.
[210:04.34]Alright, guide a black Razby from the Under Ruins.
[210:09.70]Oh, I know where that is.

[213:28.90]Fuck.
[213:29.30]Whatever.
[213:55.35]Okay, you have been delivered to Snackburg.
[214:00.49]Now, there's only one thing left to do.
[214:05.26]That's interview the two people I have not interviewed.
[214:09.68]And find Elizabeth Burtt.
[214:21.78]Side quest ignored.
[214:23.02]Pepe hands.

[214:25.72]I'm not done.
[214:27.18]Hold on a minute.
[214:40.57]Don't look at that.
[214:41.07]It's going to make me hungry.
[214:41.77]Chili cheese steak.
[214:44.10]Damn.
[214:45.10]I could go for one.
[214:47.30]Extra onions.
[214:52.43]I think that's the plan tonight, boys and girls.
[214:55.44]I think it's Philly cheesesteak with extra onions and cheese sauce on it.
[215:01.00]And then I'm just gonna melt into my couch.
[215:06.34]This whole game makes you hungry.
[215:07.86]Kind of.
[215:08.16]Alright, interview.
[215:15.99]Let's refill on this stuff.
[215:19.81]Do you have cheese sauce here?
[215:23.01]You do!
[215:23.75]Yeah, every time I find a new thing, you get cheese.
[215:25.83]It's good.
[215:26.15]Cheese sauce.
[215:29.76]That sounds so good.
[215:31.46]That sounds so good night.
[215:34.72]Good night.
[215:37.16]Hey, can you, like, come over here and just rub your hands in this and then just present them to me so I can bite them?
[215:44.76]I would really appreciate that.
[216:02.60]I'm going to plant a burrito.
[216:07.02]I'm going to donate.
[216:08.00]Okay, we got... Let's donate an egg.

[216:32.98]Wait, this is a party.
[216:33.70]Hold on, not yet.
[216:34.26]I have interviews to do.
[216:34.98]Who are you?
[216:37.46]I am Floofty Fizzlebean.
[216:38.34]The world's first gastroenterologist.
[216:39.44]The world's first Harry Potter wizard school teacher.
[217:03.79]Or any gnome in World of Warcraft.
[217:10.24]A lot of World of Warcraft references the last couple of days, and I'm really sorry about that.
[217:19.22]I'm sorry.
[217:19.80]I just, I don't know what it is today.
[217:23.44]I don't play it.
[217:24.02]I haven't played it in years.
[217:24.88]I don't care about it.
[217:25.78]What about Shadowlands?
[217:27.72]No interest in it at all.
[217:28.90]What?
[217:44.55]Hey, that was not nice.
[217:45.55]You guys are really into the links today, huh?
[217:46.77]You really are.
[217:47.47]I'm like, I'm into it.
[217:48.63]The fuck is this?
[217:49.05]What is, this is weird.
[218:16.87]How did you do that?
[218:26.34]You morphed me and Taylor Swift?
[218:30.54]Is that what you did?
[218:31.16]Somebody said that's what you did.
[218:38.42]You look like a British kid.
[218:42.30]Why British?
[218:46.12]methods or my questionable behavior.
[218:48.70]Stop editorializing and focus on the science.
[218:51.37]The kid on the corner with the newspaper.
[218:53.09]Oh, it looks like we got some news today for you.
[218:56.81]A quarter penny, please.
[219:02.85]That kind of British kid?
[219:04.33]I simply wanted to continue my work.
[219:06.51]Agabelle or no, but Sheldon blamed me for the disappearances.
[219:10.47]I'm no stranger to witch hunts.
[219:12.27]I vacated before the pitchforks could come out.
[219:17.55]Cockney orphan There is no in-between on TV and media you're either Cockney orphan or your $5,000 dress Champagne sipping socialite.
[219:32.88]There's no in-between Don't be ridiculous.
[219:39.37]I've only eaten one grumpus.
[219:40.83]Oh
[219:46.04]Don't be ridiculous.
[219:47.62]I'm only eight and one, Grumpus.
[219:49.22]Why are you saying that with a voice changer?
[219:51.38]Would you prefer I keep my severed leg in the outhouse?
[219:53.83]Austin Powers.
[219:54.81]The truth.
[219:58.93]Elizabeth was an arrogant coward, unlike Agabelle.
[220:04.13]Agabelle truly understood my research.
[220:06.50]She was hungry to participate in it.
[220:08.98]Our work together was fruitful, even pleasant, until somebody interfered.
[220:15.06]What's wrong with this person?
[220:16.80]That mummified fraud stoked Elizabeth's fear of my work.
[220:20.45]Weaponizing her relationship to Agabelle.
[220:23.09]Scrambling her fragile emotions and fabricating a binary choice between myself and Elizabeth.
[220:29.77]So what happened?
[220:30.77]Ultimately, Agabelle chose sentiment over science.
[220:35.01]And I surmise that was the death of her.
[220:36.87]Death of her.
[220:37.21]Death.
[220:37.45]Death.
[220:37.69]Kill.
[220:37.91]Kill.
[220:38.09]You killed her.
[220:38.53]You killed Elizabeth.
[220:39.51]Yes.
[220:40.53]I have the password to Agabelle's personal storage box.
[220:43.61]It may be of interest to you.
[220:45.09]Personal storage box.
[220:46.11]Didn't we already open this?
[220:52.06]I already opened that.
[220:53.38]With another key.
[220:54.16]This is old news.
[220:54.98]Alright, let's go to Isabelle's house.
[220:59.12]Hi.
[221:02.13]Isabelle's house.
[221:03.75]That's Wambush Tiffany's house.
[221:07.39]Oh, Sheldon's back.
[221:09.53]Wiggle and Gramble are going to be so stoked.
[221:12.93]Ah, yes, one has returned from a great spiritual sojourn.
[221:18.65]So it is, one would really like to lie down.
[221:24.28]Sounds intense.

[223:45.45]Gave me this key seems to go to a mysterious box.
[223:48.73]What do you mean mysterious box?
[223:54.39]In Egabelle's house.
[223:56.13]Where's this mysterious box?
[223:59.61]What are you doing?
[224:00.83]Stop looking in people's windows.
[224:06.63]I don't see a mysterious box in Egabelle's house.
[224:08.46]Alright, where's Sheldon?

[224:42.66]D'Vorah.
[224:45.52]Yeah.
[224:50.06]D'Vorah.
[224:54.36]That's before Mortal Kombat turned into a 80s movie Smash Brothers.
[225:01.59]I don't know.
[225:02.11]Why did they do that for?
[225:02.83]Oh.
[225:09.73]There was a raffle?
[225:17.74]Am I a hater?
[225:20.18]I'm not a hater.
[225:20.74]I'm just saying like it's... We've gotten every like 80s movie action and horror movie star.
[225:27.46]What's left?
[225:27.82]Freddy Krueger?
[225:36.22]Michael Myers?
[225:38.52]He's in it.
[225:39.62]No, he's not.
[225:40.16]Oh, he's in the other one.
[225:42.84]Yeah, he was.
[225:43.54]He was.
[225:44.00]That's right.
[225:44.82]I don't know.
[225:49.74]Like, Doc from... I almost said whose lines it anyways.
[225:55.50]Doc from Back to the Future.
[225:57.20]I'm sure it'll be like, and it'll have, like, devices he can use.
[226:00.10]I'm sure they'll do it.
[226:13.73]Doc getting brutalized by the Terminator.
[226:16.21]I don't know.
[226:17.21]Don't put it past them.
[226:19.68]They'll put the Care Bears in Mortal Kombat 11 at this point.
[226:26.48]so it was one journeyed far to isolate oneself and live by example added the ninja turtles to smite we're starting to get a little weird here she the huntress is gone from us straight from the mother's path chasing the healers tainted love
[226:53.37]and they're in injustice too yeah why what's with the ninja turtles showing up in other like fighting games why is it the ninja turtles it's always the ninja turtles it's like oh man here we go big reveal we're adding the ninja turtles to our fighting game or our game like it's like at this point it's been like three or four times now
[227:21.16]A doom of toxin unending.
[227:25.08]The ground shakes.
[227:26.66]It's one game.
[227:27.40]The sky spits.
[227:28.70]That's not true.
[227:30.70]Look not upon it.
[227:32.44]Move not an inch.
[227:34.62]Or be swallowed by the queen of venoms.
[227:41.33]Or so I heard.
[227:49.53]Hold on, I'm mixing my amphibious creatures.
[227:53.19]I'm thinking of the Battletoads as well.
[227:58.22]They've put the Battletoads in a few things, right?
[228:02.68]The Battletoads and the Ninja Turtles are essentially very close.
[228:09.24]I would say the Battletoads are just radical Ninja Turtles, but Ninja Turtles are radical Battletoads.
[228:17.02]This is tricky.
[228:22.91]Take that back.
[228:23.59]They're in Killer Instinct and Shovel Knight.
[228:30.45]Ooh.
[228:30.69]I love the Battletoads.
[228:32.73]I don't think they got done pretty... I don't think they were done justice, though.
[228:51.72]May answers be found in its mystery.
[228:57.58]This is a locked box.
[228:59.30]I have, oh, I think I, I think I beat the game.
[229:06.51]They just had a new game.
[229:09.65]But was it, I mean, but didn't, it wasn't like, it was like a, wasn't it like kind of tacked on to like Game Pass or something?
[229:14.93]It wasn't like big deal, was it?
[229:18.19]They also did the same shit with the Ninja Turtles too.
[229:20.29]Remember that?
[229:24.72]Remember when they remade, like they did a new Ninja Turtles beat-em-up game, and it was like, this is kind of not good.
[229:38.07]You're stalling.
[229:38.81]I'm not, what?
[229:45.01]Play the game, what the fuck?
[229:46.21]I can't, what?
[229:46.81]Where did I get that?

[232:40.85]We gotta celebrate big time.
[232:42.89]This party's gonna change everything, buddy.
[232:46.15]Are you sure you're ready?
[232:48.77]Once you start the party, you won't be able to catch Bugsnax or complete quests.
[232:52.08]Be sure you've done everything you want.
[232:53.34]Wait, this is actually the end of the game.
[232:55.30]I'm not ready.
[232:58.66]This is actually the finale.
[233:00.32]What's going on, Wiggle?
[233:01.18]Alright, I'm not ready.
[233:03.40]I'm not ready.
[233:04.02]I don't want to do your quest.
[233:05.26]Your quest is dumb.
[233:07.82]What do you have?
[233:09.20]Oh, not too bad.
[233:10.91]Actually, would you mind helping me out here?
[233:12.61]Finish this.

[233:13.79]I'm not ready.
[233:15.05]I just want to see.
[233:18.53]End this game, please.
[233:19.75]This game... I thought we were in agreement that everybody liked what was going on today and yesterday.
[233:25.49]I like... Oh, what?
[233:26.08]You don't like this?
[233:26.58]If it's not too much trouble, would you want to go exploring with me?
[233:32.56]I want to go exploring with Tiffany.
[233:33.84]The first place of note is in Flavor Falls.
[233:37.52]Meet
[233:38.88]Flavor Falls.
[233:39.68]We haven't even explored Flavor Falls.
[233:46.24]Let me explore Flavor Falls first, and then we'll do the finale.
[233:53.03]I like the game from two days ago.
[233:56.67]We haven't even looked around here.
[233:58.61]We've never even been here before.
[234:00.23]Look it, it's all new.
[234:02.31]All new.
[234:03.25]We've never even seen this before.
[234:04.75]Actually, yes we have.
[234:05.39]Give me that.
[234:07.27]Oh.
[234:08.35]I would love like a bird shit just dropped right in her hat.
[234:14.20]Okay, scan a stone grumpus and report to Trifony.
[234:20.20]I didn't even catch the sandwich yet.
[234:25.30]Scan a stone grumpus.

[234:32.75]Okay, wait, I want to ca- Whoa, what the f- That's a pickle!
[234:39.82]The jar protects it from capture.
[234:44.62]Is ranch dressing in this game?
[234:46.16]How did I not even see this before?
[234:48.80]I told you we didn't even see this.
[234:57.19]No, give that back!
[234:59.87]I got a pickle!
[235:02.07]I want to get the sandwich too.
[235:02.99]Alright.
[235:06.36]We're going to place a trap for the sandwich.
[235:07.56]Where's the sandwich?
[235:22.13]Very important.
[235:22.59]Very important.
[235:23.09]Did you know that Chandler's name backwards is... That's fun.
[235:27.17]I don't know.

[235:47.59]Okay, scan a stone grumpus and report.
[235:51.68]Alright, stone grumpus.
[235:54.26]Is one in here?
[236:00.49]Ah, it's a stone grumpus.
[236:02.71]These statues must be hundreds of years old.
[236:05.37]Very cool.
[236:06.11]I just scanned it.
[236:08.09]What is that?
[236:08.57]An inch wrap?
[236:19.66]How do I catch?
[236:21.06]Oh, gross.
[236:21.70]What's in there?
[236:35.65]Didn't I scan a stone grumpus?
[236:37.81]That's not what that is.
[236:46.48]That's a strawberry, idiot.
[236:50.18]It needs to be a stone grumpus.
[236:58.75]What's in here?
[236:59.45]Something's in here.
[237:05.58]California.
[237:06.80]It was in there.
[237:07.68]What?
[237:10.48]California.
[237:11.20]California.
[237:13.44]California.
[237:16.18]Oh, that.
[237:19.89]California.
[237:20.67]That's from Total Distortion.
[237:27.05]California.
[237:28.59]It's on the Facebook.
[237:32.69]That there would be the work of the
[237:36.13]When am I going to stream that?
[237:36.97]I already did.
[237:37.29]Long time ago.
[237:37.61]I think I did.
[237:58.83]This means Bugsnax may be a more lasting legacy than any of the stuff they built.
[238:04.23]Wait, I did stream it, didn't I?
[238:09.42]I swear to God I did.
[238:11.00]God, I've got to have the big Squidward pickle nose, right?
[238:16.20]Oh, wow, that's a good one.
[238:18.52]You might have noticed pinkle statues scattered around here.
[238:22.46]These must have been an important food source to the ancient grumps.
[238:29.81]Okay.
[238:33.15]You just ruined her.
[238:34.87]What do I mean, ruined her?
[238:38.87]Catch aggressive, meaty Bugsnax.
[238:47.58]Oh, I've got the sandwich.
[238:48.74]I've got three sandwiches for him.
[238:50.00]I just did two quests in a row.
[238:51.96]What's that?
[238:52.28]Garlic.
[238:53.02]It's a garlic enemy.
[238:53.80]Okay.
[238:58.09]Edgy poop.
[239:07.06]That's two quests.
[239:08.44]Done.
[239:09.42]Somebody else wanted to sub too, right?
[239:11.26]Uh, Wiggle.
[239:11.72]Did I get all that?
[239:23.89]Hold on.
[239:24.31]I'm curious.
[239:25.19]Let me see.
[239:27.77]I'm missing... Hmm.
[239:33.79]I'm still... What is that?
[239:37.10]Flavor Falls.
[239:38.82]I've seen almost everything, but not everything everything.
[239:42.64]Bag.
[239:44.32]Still a couple I haven't seen.
[239:47.96]Still a couple of things I haven't seen.
[239:51.88]Seen most of it, though.
[240:01.50]Missing a lot.
[240:04.54]Not enough where I'm annoyed where I want to continue to find everything.
[240:10.10]I want to turn these in.
[240:18.13]I swear if you don't 100% this game, I will shit in your hot sauce.
[240:20.67]It's going to be hard to do.
[240:22.02]The bottle is about three inches tall and like a tenth of a centimeter wide for the hole.
[240:26.72]So good luck.
[240:27.40]That's going to be weird to do.
[240:36.74]Alright, Wiggle.
[240:37.42]Where's Wiggle?
[240:38.44]Wiggle wanted me to bring a sub.
[240:41.04]I got three quests done immediately.
[240:42.67]Feed two Sandipedes.
[240:48.69]Uh-oh.
[240:51.49]Feed two... Oh, this is very important.
[240:53.35]Sub Sandipedes.
[240:55.30]Not.
[240:55.94]I gotta... Okay.
[240:59.76]Sandwich Nose.
[241:01.94]And...
[241:05.10]Sandwiched teeth?
[241:07.91]That's just onions?
[241:08.71]This is my favorite character.
[241:09.95]I'd rather do the quest for her.
[241:11.47]Do you know how I wrote Do The Wiggle?
[241:30.62]Tell me.
[241:30.90]Add bacon.
[241:31.12]I love the lean down side to side.
[241:32.78]That's my favorite animation.
[241:34.40]While the wiggle is going on, lean in, wiggle, wiggle, lean in.
[241:36.96]It's been a hard act to follow.
[242:01.53]What else do you need?
[242:06.45]Yes, I want to do whatever you want me to do.
[242:13.06]Bye.
[242:13.32]Okay.
[242:23.96]Catch one white chi poof.
[242:27.88]I can do that.
[242:33.88]You're simping for a Muppet.
[242:37.84]Don't you dare talk about my queen like that again.
[242:40.94]Uh, where are the white cheap hooves?
[242:52.71]That's a regular cheap hoof.
[242:54.43]That's a regular cheap hoof.
[242:55.41]Where's the white one?
[243:00.42]You forgot about Chanlo?
[243:01.60]Here's the problem with Chanlo.
[243:02.68]I gave two sandwiches.
[243:04.76]Therefore... Therefore... Uh, I... He needed three meaty snacks and I got rid of two of them.
[243:14.97]So...
[243:16.56]I will pick up a meaty snack here.
[243:19.02]While I get a white cheepoof.
[243:21.98]Just heard something like crawl across my desk in real life.
[243:26.19]And... Don't freak me out.
[243:28.53]Don't know what that was.
[243:29.33]It was very strange.
[243:30.57]I hope that's nothing sinister.
[243:32.29]Okay.
[243:34.45]White cheepoof.
[243:43.30]White cheepoof.
[243:46.03]Mmm, where does the White Cheepoop spawn?
[243:54.14]Don't say centipede.
[243:54.95]That's the most terrifying animal on Earth.
[244:02.09]It's at night.
[244:03.12]Oh, at night.
[244:03.58]I need to sleep then.
[244:15.15]Centipedes are terrifying, they really are.
[244:16.43]I mean, people say, oh they're cool, they're cool, they're cool.
[244:37.96]Oh, I want to have one as a pet.
[244:39.04]I want to keep one.
[244:39.72]But I gauge if I want something in my house or not.
[244:43.01]If I don't want it to hurt me and if I can interact with it.
[244:48.27]Like standing across your room while you look at like a giant emperor scorpion with binoculars.
[244:53.10]Whoa, that's fucking scary and it could kill, it could hurt me.
[244:56.78]No, I don't want that.
[245:05.87]Oh, that'd be sure horrible if that got out of its cage.
[245:10.36]I got a dog.
[245:12.30]I don't want that.
[245:13.90]If I get a centipede and you have animals in your house or something, what if it ever got out and like it attacked your dog or something?
[245:24.90]If you're into that crazy wild shit, like that's power to you, really.
[245:29.59]That's cool.
[245:30.43]Not for me at all.
[245:31.99]Keep them in the ground.
[245:38.32]You sleeping?
[245:41.64]Centipedes aren't aggressive.
[245:45.88]Centipedes aren't aggressive.
[245:49.23]Until they feel like they are threatened.
[245:51.63]Which, it could be anything.
[246:01.18]Yes, they are.
[246:01.86]Yes, they are.
[246:02.66]I don't know anything about centipedes.
[246:03.76]I just know that they're really scary looking and they're dangerous and poisonous and they hurt.
[246:10.35]Lots of centipedes in chat tonight.
[246:14.06]How dare you talk about us like that?
[246:17.34]We need to show them that we're not aggressive.
[246:18.98]We're not mean.
[246:19.92]We're not angry.

[253:06.04]Okay.
[253:06.22]That's not going to hurt.
[253:08.29]Okay.
[253:29.47]This is a crying, screaming, and farting reference.
[253:31.73]Let's do this, bro!
[253:33.41]That's so stupid.
[253:35.27]Okay, drop weights on his head.
[253:38.01]Hello!
[253:39.55]Well, you're going a little too fast.
[253:42.40]Can I... Hey, hey!
[253:52.36]Oh my goodness.
[253:54.06]More weight!
[253:54.84]Hey!
[253:59.17]That didn't hit him?
[254:00.83]That one fell down on its own.
[254:10.38]What?
[254:12.56]What?
[254:13.28]How did that fall over here?
[254:14.14]Wow, he sounds like Michael from GTA 5.
[254:26.82]Oh, what's shaking, baby?
[254:28.96]I feel swole, dog!
[254:33.62]Now let's see what you got, stump.
[254:38.82]Don't do it.
[254:42.48]He's never going to lift this stump.
[254:43.66]It's never going to happen.
[254:45.38]But that's okay.
[254:47.14]I just got to rest up and keep training.
[254:49.86]With this bug snack body, I'll get there.
[254:52.44]Because if I don't, who's going to have Snorpy's back?
[254:56.82]Just shit my pants.
[255:00.69]Wait, this is another one.
[255:02.37]We are completing his quest line.
[255:05.63]I wasn't pushing hard enough.
[255:08.01]Maybe it's the bugs.
[255:09.13]Oh, I need to go to bed.
[255:10.29]We went to go to bed.
[255:12.67]I'm hearing rumors about this monster snack out in the forest.
[255:18.32]Wamba said it was so huge.
[255:21.02]No Grumpus alive could lift it.
[255:23.86]Sounds like the ultimate workout.
[255:25.90]Let's catch it, bro.
[255:28.54]Let's do it.
[255:30.66]Eat me in Flavortown.

[255:55.02]That didn't really happen, did it?

[256:27.35]Oh my god, it's a giant watermelon.
[256:31.03]A mamamelon.
[256:33.35]This massive snack protects its offspring at all costs.
[256:36.85]Try to get the drop on it.
[256:43.07]What the hell?

[257:34.08]Maybe light it on fire?
[257:37.34]It's Rom.
[257:39.59]Rom the vacuous.
[257:45.47]hates that, loves these.
[257:46.89]Get off of it for a second, I'm trying to aim it.
[258:31.62]Breakable statue.

[258:45.48]Come over here and smash this thing.
[259:04.21]Whoa!
[259:10.32]What happened?
[259:14.52]Give me the children.
[259:15.06]Hey, come over here and play with us.
[259:26.66]Hey, look what I got.
[259:33.60]You sure don't like this, do you?
[259:35.24]Alright, he smashed his head into it.
[259:48.12]And then... How do I capture him?
[259:51.34]Try to get the... Greed.
[260:02.66]Try to get the drop on it.
[260:04.76]He smashes into a statue and then what do I do?
[260:06.98]Do I jump on top of his body?
[260:08.50]Conveniently built beneath a... Come over here, kids.
[260:26.13]I've got a toy to play with.

[260:38.85]Got him.
[260:45.80]Come over here, friends!
[260:48.50]Don't touch that.
[260:58.64]Alright, break him.
[261:04.32]I'm gonna do probably three.
[261:06.24]If it's like every single Super Mario enemy, it's three.
[261:16.84]No, stop hitting it.
[261:25.21]He's broken.
[261:26.65]Broken.
[261:27.07]Oh, he's mad now, though.
[261:30.45]Very... That was a close one, dog.
[261:34.74]That snack is on a rampage.
[261:37.38]I got an idea.
[261:38.96]I'll distract the mama.
[261:40.80]You get the drop on her.
[261:48.63]Let's go.
[261:50.13]Let's go!
[261:50.90]Oh.
[262:10.06]He's got his ass kicked.
[262:14.22]Wait, stop.
[262:15.10]Stop this.
[262:27.81]Kill.
[262:29.89]Oh, it's just a little baby.
[262:35.61]He got plowed.
[262:37.21]He got absolutely steamrolled.
[262:42.65]I kind of want to donate this.
[262:44.31]I want to donate this.
[262:45.33]Wouldn't it be more interesting?
[262:48.09]Eat one of these first.
[262:49.79]He needs it.
[262:50.13]Fine.
[263:12.70]Super Mario nose.
[263:13.40]Make him full melon?
[263:14.22]Full melon with the Mario nose.
[263:38.02]Why do they all hate themselves?
[263:39.00]That is kind of a general theme here, right?
[263:42.12]Alright, let's turn him into a full melon, though.
[264:08.61]Full Melon Chalchemist.
[264:15.01]I deserve it.
[264:34.64]Why else would you run away to Drug Snacks Island?
[264:41.17]Is that the end of his quest line?
[264:42.19]I think it is.
[264:45.11]So, what else, um... Donation, right.
[265:06.60]I think I can do the donations one more.
[265:17.58]Maybe that'll end his quest line.
[265:20.18]Yeah.
[265:20.42]Alright, that's it.
[265:21.64]The size of your heart has grown.
[265:23.40]It can't get any bigger, but donating is still a nice thing to do.
[265:26.36]Alright, well, that's maxed out.
[265:35.69]Very, very cool.
[265:36.53]Okay.
[265:38.29]Who else have I not... Who else do I care about?
[265:56.04]Wait, wiggle gets inspired.
[266:01.15]You kidding me?
[266:07.97]I hear music.
[266:17.93]Wait, where's that come from?
[266:18.69]Alright, Wiggle gets inspired.
[266:22.75]Let's go to Wiggle's house.
[266:28.07]I heard that you were inspired.
[266:29.65]Tell me what you need.
[266:30.51]I will get anything you want.
[266:31.47]Ooh, what's shakin', baby?
[266:34.63]One last chance, Doc.
[266:35.87]Last is the Wiggle.
[266:36.75]There's a massive bug snack out in the ocean.
[266:40.37]I've seen it riding the waves in the morning light.
[266:44.65]Another big boss bug?
[266:46.45]This is gonna be great.
[266:48.41]Dance with the dragon.
[267:13.27]Yeah, every side quest ends up with a legendary bug snack, that's right.
[267:18.37]Wait, are you talking about you need to... pick drug snacks to sing a good song?
[267:45.56]Am I enabling this?
[267:46.30]Yes.
[267:46.48]Sing to us.
[267:47.04]Bobsicle don't give a shit about this.
[268:18.02]I would laugh so hard if Bobsicle rammed her off the stage.
[268:20.78]That was awesome.
[268:22.82]So glad we got to see it.
[268:45.02]Come to me, come to me.
[268:46.54]My muse of the sea.
[268:48.44]My mouth is your destination.
[268:50.00]And we're gone.
[268:52.71]Here's your destiny.
[268:58.75]A semi-destiny.
[268:59.51]Yeah, yeah.
[269:01.11]Get you in my belly.
[269:03.59]Oh, yeah.
[269:04.83]Who set these lights up?
[269:06.49]Uh-oh.
[269:10.17]Oh, that's huge.
[269:12.53]Come on, let's make some music.
[269:16.55]Uh, catch the Mega Maki.
[269:22.67]Mega Maki, the head of the beast.
[269:24.03]It can't be caught until it's run out of followers.
[269:27.89]They follow behind the head in a perfect form.
[269:32.56]They're fucking raining down explosives on us.
[269:36.98]They follow behind the head in perfect formation and panic without its leader.
[269:39.78]Okay.
[269:42.69]Okay.
[269:46.00]Time to get tripped up here.
[270:02.18]Scan the butt?
[270:05.48]No, it's Mini Maki and Mega Maki.
[270:10.02]Alright, after I trip it, what do I do next?
[270:17.05]Holy shit.
[270:17.77]Alright, here we go.
[270:18.55]Oh, God.
[270:25.03]Get them all.
[270:27.11]He's pissed.
[270:29.97]Hold on.
[270:30.35]I got to catch them all.
[270:47.26]Where's it?
[270:47.74]Give me that.
[270:52.27]This shit's flying around now.
[270:53.59]Uh, does it come back in the water or is it gonna keep flying around?
[270:58.47]Did I get to phase two?
[271:01.55]Oh, shit.
[271:09.15]Okay, yep.
[271:12.75]Oh!
[271:22.42]Watch out!
[271:26.52]I'm over here!
[271:30.30]Dive bomb, dive bomb, dive bomb, dive bomb, dive bomb!
[271:34.52]No!
[271:36.03]Not high enough.
[271:38.29]Nooo, it's gonna blow up this thing.
[271:40.37]No it's not, we're good.
[271:47.17]Shit, fuck.
[271:48.33]I gotta get higher.
[271:59.20]I can't even put it up that high.
[272:04.20]This way.
[272:15.06]Here he comes.
[272:16.26]Through the hoop.
[272:18.82]I think I got to get it over there, actually.
[272:20.68]Scan the Maki again.
[272:22.40]Hold on.
[272:29.87]He's not going to go that way.
[272:30.75]It has to be that way.
[272:32.86]Yeah, it's got to be like that.
[272:35.54]Actually, my turn.
[272:36.24]Give me this.
[272:52.68]Yeah, right here.
[272:58.54]Do not break this.
[272:59.64]Don't break it.
[273:00.54]Alright, we're good.
[273:01.36]You motherfucker.
[273:12.77]Don't break the tree either, please.
[273:18.83]I think that's good.
[273:19.59]Is that a good spot?
[273:22.04]Oh, they all come back.
[273:24.72]That's good.
[273:27.28]That's a better spot over here, then.
[273:37.61]You gotta get so close to put the stupid thing up there.
[273:39.86]Alright.
[273:47.64]I hate being in the water to do this shit.
[273:54.03]I'm just standing over here.
[273:54.87]Fuck it.
[274:01.03]That'll do it.
[274:01.55]Here we go.
[274:11.55]Get back here, Minimaki!
[274:14.48]Alright, not much left.
[274:17.82]There it is.
[274:53.33]Only three more to collect and then there's no more.
[274:56.17]Get back here.
[274:58.75]Now you're just, it's just his head.
[275:08.24]Oh, it's kind of sad.
[275:16.17]I wanna put him back where he belongs, in the water.
[275:21.75]You're gonna eat this?
[275:22.59]That's not nice.
[275:24.70]Eat him to your queen.
[275:36.92]Well, this is where I make a choice.
[275:43.94]This world is indifferent to kindness.
[275:45.90]This is going to eat ball of yarn.
[275:54.33]Free of what?
[276:00.77]Do the wiggle.
[276:13.01]Are we gonna get a final song?
[276:14.29]So, you just ate a legendary endangered species creature that there's only like three of on Earth.
[276:41.77]Because you thought it was going to give you superpowers to write a song.
[276:47.64]And the other guy thought it was going to give him super strength.
[276:51.30]Oh, here comes the lesson.
[276:53.78]Right.
[276:54.69]Yeah, the lesson's incoming.
[276:57.73]We're going to get like a Wizard of Oz.
[276:59.07]You had a heart the whole time, Richard.
[277:01.23]And you wanted a brain?
[277:02.29]Of course you have a brain.
[277:03.51]Elizabeth's going to come up.
[277:06.14]Whatever, Lisbert's going to show up as the Wizard of fucking Snackburg.
[277:15.49]All coked out too.
[277:17.27]Very clearly.
[277:17.87]I never caught one of those.
[278:02.45]Got one.
[278:06.98]Alright.
[278:08.70]Fail ball once.
[278:09.28]Not yet.
[278:11.26]I'm not ready yet.
[278:12.16]I'm not done yet.
[278:13.60]I want to see one more mega animal.
[278:18.50]Not time for party.
[278:22.31]We were halfway through Becca's quest line.
[278:25.93]Remember yesterday I did a ton of her side stuff and I didn't finish it?
[278:32.28]Spy on people.
[278:33.15]I did that for like an hour last night.
[278:34.69]I got- I might as well at least complete it.
[278:45.37]Did you do it?
[278:46.69]Did you write your magnum opus?
[278:51.79]Sorry, dear.
[278:53.57]It's never going to happen.
[278:56.19]Don't be so down, Wiggle.
[278:58.39]Maybe you're overthinking it.
[279:00.25]Why don't you just write from the heart?
[279:02.75]From the heart?
[279:03.89]Oh, Gramble, you sweet summer child.
[279:08.54]Oh, that's not what I meant.
[279:09.48]I'm talking about eating the heart of the giant supreme moth.
[279:12.58]I'll never make plans.
[279:13.62]What did you think I meant?
[279:14.70]Celebrities.
[279:14.94]ResidentSleeper.
[279:43.73]Alright, who... Who... Where's Becca?
[279:51.85]Becca?
[279:53.07]Where's Becca?
[279:58.95]Main story?
[279:59.53]Main story's over.
[280:02.02]The finale is the thing that I start next.
[280:04.30]Wait, wasn't he just... Weren't he just over there?
[280:11.20]Where did he...
[280:19.41]Where's Becca?
[280:23.23]I swear to God, I can't burn these stupid houses into my memory.
[280:26.88]I'm never going to know where they are.
[280:29.16]They're all the same house, but there's a different color stripe, like Ninja Turtle stripe on them.
[280:35.78]I know they're color-coded.
[280:36.74]I know.
[280:37.77]But, like, do you think I've paid attention to who's who?
[280:42.91]You walked past her, moron.
[280:44.19]I'm not a moron.
[280:45.21]You're a moron.
[280:51.08]Okay, crumb dough.
[280:54.07]Okay.
[280:55.49]So, it's crumb dough.
[281:02.23]Find out what crumb dough does at midnight.
[281:03.93]What time is it right now?
[281:05.27]Oh, fuck.
[281:10.80]What are you doing in here?
[281:17.78]I'm gonna sleep in his bed until... Okay.
[281:21.56]What do you do at midnight?
[281:22.41]Let's find out.
[281:34.83]He sleeps.
[281:36.57]Like most people.
[281:45.40]Alright, this game's really cool because it's sort of a weird 10-20% mix of Animal Crossing, Pokémon.
[281:57.66]Almost like Stardew vibes, too.
[282:00.04]Like you can plant stuff and cultivate Bugsnax.
[282:02.61]And people like each other, they hate each other.
[282:15.00]Viva Piñata, yeah.
[282:17.56]It's a mix of a bunch of these games.
[282:19.96]Wait, that's Wiggle's big hit.
[282:22.44]He's drunk.
[282:23.96]Why are people dying for this?
[282:47.80]People are gonna be killed over Bugsnax?
[282:56.38]Look, he dances to music.
[282:57.98]What a shocker.
[283:01.51]OMG.
[283:03.95]That explains why he's always so jealous of Wiggle.
[283:07.81]Why would he even hide that?
[283:10.23]It almost makes him kind of likable.
[283:14.13]Okay, the big scoop.
[283:16.23]Got anything else for me?
[283:17.89]Alright, well, let's... I'm gonna sleep.
[283:19.45]Okay, wake up for a second.
[283:23.65]Wake up.
[283:24.23]Wake up for a minute.
[283:29.91]Oh, shit.
[283:38.67]Okay, I... There's obviously another part.
[283:42.12]Here we go.
[283:44.20]Oh, Peter.
[283:44.52]She sucks.
[284:12.23]Are we gonna get some redemption arc from her or she just sucked the whole game?
[284:15.13]Find three grumpy snack pods on the beach.
[284:16.47]Fine.
[284:16.61]That's not the beach.
[284:42.64]Is that the beach?
[284:43.06]Am I insane?
[284:46.79]Yeah, it is.
[284:50.57]You're going to 100% it?
[284:52.37]No, I'm going to 100% get my fill of the game.
[284:55.01]That doesn't mean 100% the actual video game.
[284:56.61]That means when I'm done, when I feel like I have completed the game for me.
[285:02.04]We'll see when that is.
[285:09.83]Alright, we need grumpy snack pods.
[285:12.11]On the beach.
[285:21.77]Candy patch.
[285:26.79]The snack pods are just the chip bags, right?
[285:33.36]Those are just pasted on random stones.
[285:36.60]There's one right there.
[285:41.49]Grumpy snack pod.
[285:44.44]Snack pod.
[285:45.76]Snack pod.
[285:46.94]Snack pod.
[285:47.30]Alright.
[285:52.96]Any more?
[285:54.20]Hey.
[286:05.45]Snack pod.
[286:08.11]Excuse me.
[286:15.64]Snack pod.
[286:26.23]Mm-hmm.
[286:27.99]Oh, wait, what about on the other side of this?
[286:30.55]Probably on the other side of this, right?
[286:33.65]Right.
[286:35.05]Right, right, right.
[286:39.54]What's that?
[286:40.10]Oh, the villager from Minecraft.
[286:43.84]Right?
[286:44.78]Yeah.
[286:45.40]Close enough.
[286:53.35]I don't see any others on the beach.
[286:54.43]Come on.
[287:04.38]Where are they?
[287:06.66]I missed one?
[287:12.75]Is this a scenario where they don't come out in the rain?
[287:15.61]Or is this a scenario where they're just always around no matter what?
[287:17.99]I'm just going to find them.
[287:19.51]Oh, I thought that was one right there.
[287:42.75]inside log alright relax that's not one what are you talking about
[288:11.78]You're great at pretending.
[288:13.28]I've looked in almost every log.
[288:15.12]Somebody said to go in the... What log?
[288:17.42]I looked in all the logs.
[288:22.32]I've seen every log.
[288:31.63]I've read all the logs.
[288:35.01]And a lot of you are bullshitters.
[288:46.25]What about over here?
[288:46.83]Yeah, I've read the logs.
[288:51.43]I see what you said three days ago versus what you said today.
[288:53.61]I'll reload the area.
[289:11.98]No, there ain't no, there ain't, there ain't no.
[289:16.50]Just one?
[289:16.86]Okay, I need one more.
[289:18.24]Alright, reload the zone.
[289:37.72]Last one in log.
[289:41.99]No, there's not.
[289:42.89]I'm going to reload the area because I do not believe you.
[289:46.01]I don't trust you.
[290:01.94]By the way, I want to just I have this to talk about, too.
[290:05.24]So there's a theme song for this game that has this was made by a famous band, and I haven't heard it once the whole playthrough.
[290:20.53]What's the point of it being a theme song?
[290:21.75]Is it a credits song?
[290:23.71]We'll find out.
[290:26.32]Famous in quotes.
[290:27.20]I don't know.
[290:27.64]I've never heard of them.
[290:39.31]Is it just the trailer?
[290:43.23]It might be.
[290:51.54]Becky.
[290:55.74]Becky's not in her house.
[290:56.96]Where is she?
[291:00.62]Becky.
[291:02.18]Where's Becky?
[291:02.84]There's Becky.
[291:07.02]Were you just videotaping Filbert's bed?
[291:12.35]You are fucking... What the hell's wrong with you?
[291:15.19]Oh, yeah.
[291:22.40]Why can it not change her nose?
[291:24.18]That annoys me for some reason.
[291:28.64]Thanks, bestie.
[291:34.25]Thanks, bestie.
[291:36.01]Thanks, bestie.
[291:36.83]Thanks, bestie.
[291:49.93]Fuck you.
[291:55.02]Fuck you.
[291:55.62]What?
[291:56.68]Oh my god.
[291:57.38]What the hell?
[291:59.96]Alright, wait.
[292:03.69]Sleep in a bed and then talk to her again.
[292:12.13]What's with the hostility?
[292:13.07]Yeah, I don't know.
[292:14.47]What's with the hostility?
[292:19.44]Nothing new from you?
[292:22.98]Wait, that's it?
[292:23.84]You don't want me to do anything?
[292:25.90]What's the point of doing all that weird shit for you?
[292:27.52]I have to wait a bit?
[292:37.08]Alright, I'm going to sleep again for like three days.
[292:53.88]Alright.
[292:55.76]What's new?
[292:56.12]Where'd everybody go?
[293:10.19]Hi.
[293:13.05]That monster Grumpus thing is still on the loose.
[293:16.55]Later.
[293:21.66]Alright, well, what the heck.
[293:23.65]Sleep till noon.
[293:34.23]And?
[293:34.47]You alright?
[293:36.67]Why?
[293:55.52]Hey, you don't have anything to tell me?
[293:57.06]Here, eat one of these.
[294:08.56]That just looks like somebody cut her nose off in half facing us.
[294:16.83]What the hell?
[294:17.39]She has nothing for me to do.
[294:23.51]I already did your stuff.
[294:24.33]Alright.
[294:24.91]What about, um... I gotta go get you.
[294:29.77]Ooh, I'm in the middle of something with other people, too.
[294:34.87]Deal or no deal?
[294:35.57]Alright, catch a buffalo cussed.
[294:42.92]Buffalo cussed is in the sizzling, uh... Sands.
[294:46.48]Or serpents, whatever.
[294:47.24]What's going on?
[294:49.30]How's it going?
[294:57.45]This is the thing that dive bombs, right?
[295:01.65]Dive bomb into water.
[295:02.58]It's in Boiler Bay.
[295:12.26]Across the bridge.
[295:17.17]Watch the ending on YouTube.
[295:20.73]Talking to me?
[295:26.74]I have an hour to drop off these red box rentals, please.
[295:30.79]Those things exist still?
[295:37.87]It's rented on iTunes, dude.
[295:44.17]Okay.
[295:46.31]There he is.
[295:48.41]And there he is.
[295:49.33]The supreme meat lover's pizza.
[295:56.00]I've never seen you before.
[295:59.64]Oh, it's a black olive.
[296:01.82]It loves to eat things that are, lick up things that are cheesy.
[296:09.81]Okay, this spicy.
[296:16.41]Um, where is he?
[296:17.87]What happened?
[296:19.93]Where, what happened?
[296:21.34]He's on the ground right here.
[296:23.08]Who killed?
[296:23.54]Fucking on fire.
[296:25.38]Of course you are.
[296:26.19]Why?
[296:26.53]I have to have him dive bomb into the water.
[296:32.83]Alright, get over here.
[296:38.04]I didn't even get to read.
[296:38.86]It loves to dive into its favorite.
[296:41.72]It loves to dive into ranch dressing.
[296:43.26]Okay.
[296:45.44]Okay.
[296:48.35]So we got to bring you over here.
[296:55.07]Same.
[297:02.58]Is there anything cold?
[297:07.16]Alright.
[297:07.62]So then we got to launch you.
[297:10.70]Okay.
[297:14.08]I'm going to coat the ball.
[297:16.68]Hold the ball and ranch.
[297:21.56]Is this an Eric Andre skit?
[297:23.22]Ranch ball!
[297:23.96]Alright, dive!
[297:40.23]Oh, you sprayed him!
[297:41.11]Thanks, man.
[297:45.38]Time to deliver a pizza ball.
[297:47.59]Yeah, that's what it is.
[297:48.23]Not ranch ball.
[297:49.79]I haven't seen any of the new season, by the way.
[297:51.77]So don't tell me anything.
[297:55.41]Let's go deliver this.
[298:05.00]So you want to hit this ranch?
[298:09.16]You know what I'm so happy about?
[298:12.08]I am so happy that Eric Andre's show did not get the Rick and Morty treatment.
[298:18.77]You know what I mean?
[298:19.65]Where, oh my god, like, all the fans, like, ruined it, right?
[298:30.14]It was very, very, very possible for that to happen.
[298:36.67]Stop talking about it.
[298:37.81]Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[298:39.31]Forget it.
[298:39.75]Forget I said anything.
[298:41.85]TV sucks.
[298:42.59]I hate TV.
[298:44.31]Don't ever watch television.
[298:45.23]Alright, we gotta go back and deliver.
[298:52.20]But I want this cheese sauce.
[299:05.89]Imagine letting fans ruin something for you.
[299:08.23]I know, I'm just, I'm saying that it was possible for, okay, it was possible for me to say the word Eric Andre and people would go, oh, Reddit show, oh yeah, pizza ball, haha, so funny, Reddit.
[299:21.06]It was, that's very true, that's possible, yes it is.
[299:25.18]Hey, Triffany, what's going on?
[299:26.92]Yeah?
[299:27.02]Hey, how you doing?
[299:28.72]Great work, pal.
[299:29.91]Now hand it over and watch me work.
[299:34.89]It did happen.
[299:36.41]His show is... He's very, very, very funny.
[299:38.18]A buffalocus.
[299:38.60]There is, like, a Sesame Street character that looks just like her.
[299:41.66]The way that she is now.
[300:05.18]Who is it?
[300:05.58]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[300:10.54]What's the deal here?
[300:12.18]I'm not letting a crook like you get a hold of that map.
[300:15.61]You'll just swipe the bug snaps and sell them off.
[300:18.79]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[300:20.51]No, no, wait, don't touch that.
[300:27.18]Are you sure that's not him?
[300:28.48]Nice night out.
[300:32.54]Starting timeouts at 10 minutes.
[300:33.26]Don't spam coffee pasta.
[300:34.70]You're all in trouble.
[301:01.95]Can someone help him?
[301:03.37]He does this every single day.
[301:05.01]Can somebody please help him?
[301:06.79]Can we put a lock on his door at night or something?
[301:09.73]Can we just bar him in the house?
[301:36.01]Feed him.
[301:54.68]Wait, what am I doing?
[301:56.00]Wait, doesn't he not... Doesn't he not want to do this?
[302:11.88]Why did I just do that to this guy?
[302:14.47]Wait, take it all.
[302:15.11]Take it all.
[302:15.35]He won't know.
[302:16.25]Hold on.
[302:33.83]Oh, you slept on your arm wrong.
[302:35.49]Oops.
[302:40.87]Steal the map.
[303:05.82]What was that?
[303:07.38]Cactus?
[303:10.00]Yes, it's me, Cactus.
[303:12.09]Love you, Cactus.
[303:14.89]You prickly pear.
[303:20.95]I have your map.
[303:21.39]I have your map.
[303:23.53]I have your map.
[303:24.93]Nice job.
[303:26.25]Easy as pie.
[303:28.99]I'm an inside man.
[303:29.71]Here, have one of these.
[303:31.01]Wake up!
[304:00.87]Where am I?
[304:01.67]Oh, thanks for waking me.
[304:06.34]How come he's not going to go like, what happened?
[304:11.56]I'm going to sleep and I'm going to finish Grumbo's quest.
[304:29.57]Oh.
[304:29.89]Wake me up.
[304:30.53]Okay.
[304:30.69]Sure, I will.
[304:32.09]I'm back.
[304:33.29]Alright, now what else we got?
[304:59.45]Becca!
[304:59.79]Stop simping for Befica.
[305:04.29]I'm talking to someone.
[305:06.07]That doesn't mean I'm simping for them.
[305:08.29]If I was a cashier at a grocery store or at a mall and I've rung up a lady
[305:30.57]Why are you simping for that lady?
[305:32.87]I'm ringing her up.
[305:34.19]She's buying things at the store.
[305:36.77]Hi.
[305:39.77]Anyways.
[305:40.15]Hi.
[305:41.45]Please, I'll do anything for you.
[305:42.57]Anything.
[305:46.01]Find out what he does at midnight.
[305:47.07]Sure thing.
[305:47.55]Anything for you.
[305:48.49]Literally anything.
[305:56.64]Hey, get this on camera.
[306:01.05]My belly doesn't- Okay.
[306:22.96]Uh, find out what Chandler does at midnight.
[306:26.39]Okay, where's Chandler live?
[306:27.65]I'm just gonna sleep in his bed.
[306:34.36]Leave me alone.
[306:34.70]Does he live in the bathroom?
[306:40.56]There's Wiggle.
[306:41.40]Befica.
[306:43.18]Where's his little green house?
[306:47.70]He lives at the gym.
[306:52.66]Where is his house?
[306:53.66]I don't see... Does he not... Does he sleep in the mill?
[306:55.72]Why does he sleep in the mill?
[306:58.96]What the heck?
[307:00.91]What's wrong with you, dude?
[307:03.00]What are you doing with your backside here, man?
[307:05.66]This motherfucker looks like he's about to lay eggs.
[307:32.29]OK, sleep until midnight.
[307:33.47]Why can't I can't sleep in his bed?
[307:37.47]Oh, this is bullshit.
[307:45.23]I can't sleep in your bed either.
[307:58.77]What does he do at midnight?
[308:08.61]Where's he at?
[308:19.13]Uh, what is he doing?
[308:23.10]The great thing about being Chandlo, what you see is what you get.
[308:28.42]I got nothing to hide.
[308:30.36]No shame.
[308:32.65]There's no dirt.
[308:33.29]You checking out this beef, bro?
[308:35.73]I don't blame you.
[308:38.38]He's just a normal weirdo.
[308:51.04]Uh, sorry, Becca.
[308:52.48]There's no dirt on this dude.
[309:04.34]Sorry.
[309:06.85]He's just a regular guy.
[309:08.05]Wake up at noon, talk to someone, go to bed till midnight.
[309:12.43]Green Bugsnax.
[309:13.09]Turn Peficus' arms into green snacks.
[309:14.99]I think you already, um...
[309:35.63]That is the sushi?
[309:38.18]The maki roll green, technically?
[309:39.74]No?
[309:43.26]Really?
[310:00.96]It's not green.
[310:02.58]What about pickles?
[310:04.24]Uh, I need to feed her a pickle.
[310:09.09]That looks so strange.
[310:13.87]This is, this is, okay.
[310:15.71]If you would have, like, Uber Eats Sushi shit-faced.
[310:20.32]Yeah, this sushi's a good idea.
[310:23.14]Order it for Uber Eats.
[310:25.62]It gets delivered to your house.
[310:27.04]Oh, yeah, this is what I want.
[310:28.52]You eat one of them and you just like drop the rest on the fucking couch in the container and you wake up the next morning and that's what it looks like.
[310:36.50]You ate one piece and the rest just fucking fell all over the place.
[310:45.32]Or you eat one piece, you drop it all over the bed and then you go and like you puke.
[310:52.14]Sushi is a good idea.
[310:54.48]I'll take two California rolls and two spicy tuna rolls.
[310:59.86]Uber Eats.
[311:11.90]I can't relate to that rich streamer.
[311:13.76]Sushi, Uber Eats.
[311:18.95]By the way, that's already a bad idea.
[311:25.43]I know, people, I'm going to get shit for this.
[311:28.83]But for me, look, this is not for you.
[311:31.65]This is not your friends.
[311:33.13]This is not your parents.
[311:33.95]This is me.
[311:35.37]If I do not eat sushi sitting down at a sushi restaurant, I will not eat it.
[311:40.78]I do not want it.
[311:42.06]The sushi that's at the grocery store, the sushi that's at the gas station, and ordering delivery sushi, I'm not into that at all.
[311:54.62]Sorry, we can't have our own personal sushi chefs.
[311:57.04]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[311:58.20]I'm just saying, like, I don't... The spicy tuna roll that's at the gas station is something I don't want to eat.
[312:08.05]Everyone's saying delivery.
[312:09.49]That's true.
[312:10.49]You could, like, Uber Eats, like we said, that little routine there.
[312:15.51]Here's the problem.
[312:17.19]Sometimes, when you order on those apps...
[312:19.89]Um, the guy or the girl doesn't fucking show up on time.
[312:23.43]And you might be... You might order your takeaway sushi.
[312:29.30]And it shows up like 55 minutes later.
[312:33.80]After they did like two or three deliveries before yours.
[312:37.86]Delivery sushi not gonna happen.
[312:39.28]Pick it up.
[312:39.92]Pick it up.
[312:49.71]Yes, you could pick it up.
[312:52.67]But I'm just telling you delivery sushi I'm not okay with.
[312:57.55]Or gas station and grocery store sushi.
[313:00.33]I want to be at the restaurant.
[313:01.48]I want to see them make it.
[313:02.58]Because I don't know.
[313:03.66]I have no idea from... No.
[313:08.32]That's reasonable and understandable.
[313:10.84]Gift that guy some.
[313:13.46]I'll do it.
[313:15.46]I'm doing it.
[313:19.74]Somebody do it already?
[313:25.18]Where is it?
[313:27.16]What's your name?
[313:29.36]Too fast.
[313:30.82]There it is.
[313:32.91]Sheepish dialect.
[313:33.99]You're getting a community sub.
[313:34.93]Did you already get it or am I doing it?
[313:49.02]Nepotism.
[313:49.80]Here it comes.
[313:50.50]Nepotism.
[313:57.10]Pick me.
[313:57.64]Pick me.
[314:02.49]I am picking out the one person in chat that has pleased me.
[314:05.87]Did he already get one?
[314:08.27]He got one already.
[314:11.21]Wait.
[314:11.47]Did he get one?
[314:12.05]I think he already has one.
[314:27.11]Do they have one?
[314:28.59]I can't- hold on.
[314:29.31]Let me see if they have one.
[314:30.39]He has one.
[314:41.32]He has one.
[314:42.46]I can't even give it to him.
[314:44.86]Mostly Lost already gave it to him.
[314:46.68]I can't even- Hey, well, nice job.
[314:53.38]That's- you deserve that for being a reasonable, understandable person.
[315:01.51]Hey, I agree with you, happy face.
[315:03.45]No, that's not how it works.
[315:04.35]It's only a one-time deal.
[315:06.97]I'm gonna go get some pickles.
[315:23.20]This guy sucks.
[315:24.26]Fuck you.
[315:25.38]Gift me a sub instead.
[315:26.70]You're like an eight-year sub.
[315:34.15]Is this where the pickles are?
[315:39.01]No, this is not where the pickles are.
[315:40.31]That's not a green vegetable.
[315:49.76]It's in Flavortown, right?
[315:57.32]Yeah, I'm going the right way.
[315:58.02]When are you going to do a PS5 raffle?
[316:03.49]Uh...
[316:05.34]I would not hold your breath for that one.
[316:06.48]Alright, pickle time.
[316:14.25]Where is a pickle?
[316:15.23]There is a pickle.
[316:16.25]Alright, green snack.
[316:23.95]We got it.
[316:24.65]Leave.
[316:33.64]What the fuck?
[316:34.28]What?
[316:37.66]I want to say it so bad, but I can't.
[316:39.35]You guys can all say it, and you don't get to attack each other for it.
[316:45.85]When I say it, I make it real.
[316:48.71]When you say it, apparently it's not real.
[317:07.96]Say it and see what happens.
[317:10.71]That sounds like a threat.
[317:11.91]I don't think I'm going to follow up with that.
[317:13.15]Okay, green arms.
[317:25.56]Hey, Becca.
[317:27.92]Eat this pickle.
[317:35.77]There you go.
[317:36.31]And let's give everybody just pickle.
[317:38.49]You know, just have everything.
[317:39.69]Be just total pickle.
[317:42.24]This is perfect.
[317:44.96]Thanks, bestie.
[317:46.40]Here's the plan.
[317:48.36]Snorpy basically can't see without his glasses.
[317:51.10]I'm pickle Befuga.
[317:51.68]And I know he cleans them every day at five.
[317:54.58]So we'll approach him then.
[317:56.20]And if I'm green and I say bro a lot, he'll think I'm Chandlo.
[318:00.08]And obviously Snorpy isn't going to keep Chandlo's secrets from himself.
[318:06.76]Perfect.
[318:07.40]You know it, bestie.
[318:09.54]Snorpy isn't gonna know what hit him.
[318:11.34]That's lap two.
[318:12.08]Let's hang out until it's time.
[318:13.62]Hey, Snorp Dog.
[318:20.53]Can I, like, ask you something?
[318:22.95]Chandler, is that you?
[318:24.79]I can't see.
[318:25.87]This guy's real, real dumb.
[318:28.65]There's no time, bro.
[318:30.45]This is important.
[318:32.68]Oh, uh, well, alright then.
[318:34.82]What is it?
[318:35.80]Bro, you remember that deep, dark secret we were talking about?
[318:40.82]You know, the really super secret one?
[318:44.38]Oh, ah, that, yes.
[318:48.20]I suppose it is time we talked about it.
[318:53.48]He's getting boradded.
[318:55.72]I've been afraid of talking about it for so long, but the truth is, Chandler, I love you.
[319:02.14]That was really good.
[319:05.35]That's not a secret to anybody.
[319:07.33]Bethica, when did you get here?
[319:09.99]How dare you intrude on our private moment?
[319:13.65]Bro, she just ran off, dog.
[319:16.54]He's going to start tucking his pants in.
[319:18.98]Stop.
[319:20.02]Hello?
[319:21.12]Chandler?
[319:22.26]Anybody?
[319:26.71]I love the marshmallow nose, but I think he deserves a pickle nose.
[319:39.18]Minion?
[319:39.32]Yeah, he looks like a minion, but he doesn't sound like a minion.
[319:41.58]He didn't go... He didn't do any of that.
[320:11.82]That was Stitch.
[320:13.12]That was less minion, more Stitch.
[320:18.41]They're the same damn... They sound exactly the same.
[320:29.49]I'm sorry, dude.
[320:30.09]Did I offend you with that?
[320:31.27]I said Stitch and the minions are the exact same?
[320:36.61]He's very, very shocked about that.
[320:43.14]Yeah, and guess what?
[320:43.94]Murlocs and Stitch and Minions are the same too.
[320:51.21]And so are the Jawas.
[320:53.25]The Jawas, the Murlocs, the Stitches.
[320:55.57]They're all the same.
[320:56.53]They all talk the same.
[321:01.31]Yep.
[321:02.16]According to the journal, this time we're heading for the Boiling Bay.
[321:10.94]They all go like... Yes, they do.
[321:12.26]They all do.
[321:12.62]It's just funny gibberish with a high pitch.
[321:15.19]That's lemmings.
[321:43.13]Why did somebody say... He's right.
[321:44.65]Give me a sub, please.
[322:10.10]Hashtag kill Jerma.
[322:11.94]What, because I said Jawas and minions talk the same?
[322:14.59]You're gonna roast me over the fire for that?
[322:59.12]Okay.
[323:04.20]Which was which?
[323:05.20]Tell me.
[323:09.26]That was two different audios.
[323:10.64]Two different clips.
[323:11.78]Which was which?
[323:19.37]both women first one was minions first one was java really hey
[323:51.49]Some of you guys can't tell the difference.
[323:57.31]What if I told you that it was both minions?
[324:04.67]Play them over each other.
[324:23.38]What's with the music?
[324:28.75]What was with the music?
[324:29.91]Alright, well that one's easy because the UntD, the minions don't do that.
[324:49.46]Scan a treasure chest.
[324:51.34]Oh.
[324:57.50]Oh, shit.
[325:00.56]What about Stitch?
[325:02.95]I'm- No, we're not going into the- We're not going into the weeds here.
[325:10.15]Alright, scan a treasure chest and report- Feed a- Hold on.
[325:16.56]I was- No, I- Alright.
[325:18.04]The Jawas and the Minions and the Stitches- They- They have very similar dialect, okay?
[325:23.34]And I- I know it for a fact that you can't prove me wrong.
[325:28.28]And the Rabbids, too.
[325:29.24]Were the Raving Rabbids?
[325:30.38]Should we pull out the Raving Rabbids?
[325:36.34]Stitch is nothing like those two.
[325:40.04]Alright.
[325:41.58]Over.
[325:47.37]Alright, I need to scan a treasure chest.
[325:50.37]Where is a treasure chest?
[326:13.13]Got one.
[326:13.45]I bet about every Jerma voice is the same voice.
[326:19.92]We're not talking about me right now.
[326:21.36]We're talking about minions, Jawas, and Rabbids.
[326:36.15]Where's there a treasure chest?
[326:37.13]Alright, let me talk to you again.
[326:38.09]Maybe you'll tell me where it is.
[326:44.85]If you don't mind, keep your eyes peeled for a treasure chest and a freezing cold bully of a bug snail.
[327:01.51]Mmm, treasure chest.
[327:09.88]Sounds like minions to me.
[327:10.86]I'm on a treasure chest!
[327:23.93]Yeah, I didn't know that everybody was going to be so defending the minions.
[327:43.31]I didn't know we were gonna get some real minion defense in here.
[327:47.79]Wait, is it because I said Stitch and minions?
[327:49.45]I think that's what happened.
[327:50.11]You were right.
[327:50.43]You should say it.
[327:50.83]I'll defend Stitch.
[327:51.45]Well, maybe Stitch shouldn't have been in there.
[327:53.95]I haven't heard Stitch in a long time.
[328:18.16]Alright, now we're gonna feed Tiffany a Pale Toss.
[328:21.14]Hmm.
[328:32.53]That's a backtrack?
[328:33.35]Fine.
[328:36.57]Whoa!
[328:45.09]Whoa, I don't like this.
[328:46.17]We're defending Stitch.
[328:48.01]Pickle Jerma.
[329:12.89]I can't find anything.
[329:15.35]She's not here either.
[329:20.20]I didn't mean to keep it from you, but that journal, it belonged to my... See, some years ago...
[329:32.88]Something about she lost a lot of blood?
[329:35.68]Oh, she wrote a blog?
[329:36.80]Catch one Scoopy Banoopy.
[330:04.90]Were you listening to that?
[330:06.46]You little shit.
[330:07.46]Eavesdropper.
[330:09.43]Yeah.
[330:11.89]Don't fucking tell anybody that.
[330:13.15]Don't leak that conversation.
[330:16.19]I'll know who did.
[330:18.67]Right?
[330:20.43]It's a golden quable.
[330:21.30]I gotta get him.
[330:23.60]I changed my mind.
[330:24.28]I'm just gonna take you.
[330:25.10]What does he like?
[330:33.48]Loves chocolate.
[330:34.19]Okay, cool.
[330:41.34]I mean, I kind of need the golden Quaible, right?
[330:56.63]Remember your niece is watching.
[330:57.91]I don't think so.
[330:58.55]I don't think they know what this game is.
[331:05.75]Long time viewer, first time watcher.
[331:07.39]Wait, what?
[331:20.76]That didn't make any sense, right?
[331:27.82]Long time watcher, first time viewer here.
[331:29.64]How's it going?
[331:30.57]I think I read that wrong.
[331:46.49]Alright, what about Crummy?
[331:48.53]Where is he?
[331:51.27]Anything new from Crummy?
[331:55.72]There is something from Crummy.
[331:58.00]Let's go.
[331:58.44]Okay.
[332:27.62]I'm trying to see.
[332:29.65]I need to know.
[332:31.51]I need to know.
[332:37.19]Please.
[332:37.73]I'm just trying to look something up.
[332:40.29]I can't.
[332:41.39]There's no info on this.
[332:42.42]Oh, this is for the pizza.
[332:44.72]Right.
[332:52.44]We're gonna get the big pizza.
[332:53.68]Could use a good slicing.
[332:54.52]An old tomb.
[332:55.50]You're gonna summon him, don't do it.
[333:25.23]Sarcophagus.
[333:25.83]This ancient stone coffin is stuck shut.
[333:27.69]Perhaps it needs to be cut open.
[333:30.41]Do we have a cutting tool or something eventually here?
[333:32.13]Alright.
[333:33.39]Get on it.
[333:51.62]How about the dive-bombing bug snack?
[333:53.86]Or the ancient pizza cutter?
[333:55.48]Uh... Okay, we're gonna use the ancient pizza cutter on the ancient sarcophagus.
[334:21.29]Bombino.
[334:22.59]When threatened, this bug snack becomes an explosive bomb.
[334:25.33]Okay, what do you like?
[334:30.11]You love cheese.
[334:36.64]Oh, I just covered him in cheese.
[334:44.10]Oh, I can just pick him up.
[334:53.18]Oh!
[334:54.46]That was cool.
[334:55.04]Alright, so now... Figure out how to summon Mothra Supreme.
[335:19.65]Uh...
[335:37.67]Mysterious altar.
[335:38.97]This altar has a slot on top that perfectly fits the launch pad.
[335:42.23]Perhaps the launch pad needs to be placed here.
[335:49.29]Whatever.
[335:49.63]Alright, defeat Monthra Supreme.
[335:54.46]Bomb snacks!
[336:06.47]Alright, what do I do?
[336:08.37]Why are they all on fire already?
[336:10.77]I definitely have to... Okay, we have to launch the bombs at them.
[336:15.63]Come here.
[336:16.89]Stop being on fire.
[336:17.53]Why are they all on fire?
[336:18.60]Why are they already all burnt up and...
[336:44.87]Serve it up.
[336:53.57]What fell out of him?
[336:55.77]Pizza.
[336:57.03]Pizza sleeve.
[336:58.43]A sleeve of pizza.
[337:00.45]No, wait.
[337:01.11]I gotta cut him.
[337:02.19]I gotta cut him.
[337:02.91]We gotta cut him.
[337:06.39]He has to go over here.
[337:07.73]How do I attract him over here?
[337:08.61]Because then I'm going to cut through his body.
[337:23.76]There are more than one cutter.
[337:26.96]Oh, fuck.
[337:28.74]Okay.
[337:34.00]Oh, he didn't unlock the other cutters.
[337:45.03]Alright, slice him up.
[337:47.01]Ooh!
[337:49.05]Is that... Where'd he go?
[338:02.80]What the fuck?
[338:03.44]Here we go.
[338:15.02]Caught!
[338:18.04]Ow!
[338:20.90]Put it out!
[338:21.46]Put it out!
[338:21.94]Put it out!
[338:32.61]He's pissed.
[338:37.41]I want to aim the launcher.
[338:38.73]Alright, give me a bag.
[338:45.72]I don't want that.
[338:46.62]I want this.
[338:55.19]A final slice.
[338:58.23]It went over his head?
[338:59.05]Wait, did it go over his head?
[339:04.15]Why did it fly over him?
[339:13.74]I didn't do anything.
[339:14.92]I didn't do anything.
[339:15.80]He fell.
[339:22.90]Mothra Supreme, huh?
[339:25.44]Not so supreme anymore.
[339:35.03]I'll be coughing up sand for a week.
[339:37.43]But with those new Bugsnax, I can just buy new lungs.
[339:42.78]Here you go.
[339:47.63]That was sad.
[339:48.41]Oh, the pizza nose is just pepperoni.
[339:51.33]It's not a full pizza circle.
[339:53.95]He said mom.
[339:56.47]Mom!
[340:02.16]That's really sad.
[340:02.98]That was kind of fucked up what you said.
[340:13.72]This game is sad.
[340:14.66]Yeah, it is.
[340:17.56]Alright, I got two.
[340:18.98]I got one.
[340:19.62]I got Becca's quest line to do.
[340:22.01]And then I'll probably just end.
[340:23.27]I'll finish the game there.
[340:26.99]I'm so far into Becca's quest line that why would I not do it?
[340:30.07]Okay.
[340:43.75]This game has been very, very fun.
[340:46.47]How much... Wait.
[340:47.39]How much is this game?
[340:49.49]Very important question.
[340:50.31]How much is this game?
[340:50.91]I don't even... I forgot.
[340:59.05]This game is 25.
[341:00.01]It's 20, 30 bucks.
[341:02.01]Absolutely worth it.
[341:02.65]100%.
[341:02.67]$24.99.
[341:02.69]It is 1 million percent worth it.
[341:17.20]It's a solid 10 to 12 hours of game.
[341:18.94]And then there's other little secret bugs you can collect.
[341:21.96]There's probably 15 to 20 hours of content here.
[341:24.02]If you wanted it.
[341:24.72]And it's fun.
[341:25.38]And it's cute.
[341:47.23]You win.
[341:48.49]Take him, Beth.
[341:49.99]Hand yours over, pal.
[341:51.99]Oh, no need.
[341:53.39]I'd never sell out my bestie.
[341:54.85]Is he sleepwalking again?
[341:57.89]Alright, I'm going to go to bed and I'm going to look at my log and we'll see who's got something to do.
[342:13.99]Okay.
[342:15.09]Here we go.
[342:16.49]Befica wants to disguise herself as Chanlo to get his secrets.
[342:20.39]This is... Here we are.
[342:21.74]I think this is the end of her line here.
[342:26.68]Wait, you got something else too?
[342:29.61]Desserts?
[342:32.43]You don't get it, pal.
[342:34.23]It doesn't matter if I'm honest or dishonest.
[342:37.31]Either way, I lose out in the end.
[342:39.94]You think I like being a scumbag?
[342:42.52]A grifter?
[342:43.22]A hustler?
[342:44.62]It's all miserable.
[342:47.88]okay I think I haven't tried huh I gave honest living enough chances but I wasn't born rich and that means I can't afford to be happy so unless you're gonna buy something one downside yeah the one downside somebody said Steam users malding
[343:04.84]Yeah, this is like on the Epic Games Store right now.
[343:07.36]It's like, okay.
[343:08.44]Like, cool.
[343:10.28]It'll be on Steam in like six months probably, right?
[343:13.36]That's the only downside.
[343:14.50]It's like, alright, you gotta get another launcher.
[343:17.08]But that, it's a great game.
[343:18.78]Doesn't really, whatever.
[343:20.74]You have to download like an .exe file.
[343:27.14]I'm not ready to talk to you yet.
[343:37.85]Wait, I was in the middle of your line, too.
[343:40.39]Okay, I was in the middle of her quest line.
[343:45.87]One more place.
[343:46.67]Alright, we're about to close out her line.
[343:59.98]Finish the game?
[344:01.88]Well, you understand that once I finish the game, the stream is over.
[344:06.97]You know that, right?
[344:09.73]So, all you guys calling for me to end the game, you're actually calling for me to end the stream.
[344:18.93]The heck is going on here?
[344:25.27]That's the point.
[344:25.93]Yeah.
[344:31.50]I'm good.
[344:32.50]I'm still having fun.
[344:33.66]Look, I'm gonna play my video game.
[344:35.42]You can play your video game.
[344:37.34]And we can... I thought she was on crutches for a second.
[344:58.27]We gotta let him know to catch the Snoopy Banoopy here.
[345:02.95]Noted.
[345:03.35]I'll get it.
[345:15.98]You're really, really exhausting this, aren't you?
[345:18.66]Come on.
[345:19.20]Let's go.
[345:19.80]Up the top of the mountain.
[345:20.98]Keep going.
[345:22.82]Alright, we made it.
[345:25.13]This is way too happy for what you're looking at right now.
[345:48.80]Oh, I'm trying to find my long-lost grandma.
[345:51.02]I wonder what happened to her.
[345:51.90]Oh, she's dead, frozen.
[345:53.09]Her skeleton's in an ice cube.
[345:55.51]Ooh, I wonder what she ate before she died.
[345:57.85]What?
[345:58.49]Even when I was a kid, grandma didn't have too many teeth.
[346:03.79]This can't be her.
[346:04.83]Unless... Unless I'm remembering wrong.
[346:09.46]Or she got spares?
[346:11.42]It's been so long, I suppose I can't say.
[346:15.04]If I want to be dead, sure.
[346:16.36]I need an expert.
[346:27.96]So I guess I'll bury your grandmother.
[346:34.73]Your... A lost explorer from relatively modern times.
[346:54.81]Can't die in this game, don't worry.
[346:56.55]Alright, I need a Snoopy Banoopy.
[347:00.91]Scoopy Banoopy.
[347:02.99]There's a Scoopy Banoopy.
[347:08.23]We need fire.
[347:09.21]Come with me.
[347:13.52]What does he hate?
[347:14.06]He loves chocolate.
[347:15.22]Alright, give me the ball.
[347:17.56]Chocolate on that ball.
[347:24.18]Hey, Scoopy.
[347:26.46]Come over here.
[347:29.96]Run, run, run, run, run, run away.
[347:37.56]All of a sudden, just not interested?
[347:38.64]Why?
[347:41.96]What are you doing?
[347:42.40]Scoopy, Scoopy.
[347:58.38]You just ruined everything, ball.
[347:59.80]Good.
[348:00.02]Knock him off the cliff.
[348:02.69]Okay, now... Um... We have to trip him.
[348:10.63]What the fuck just happened?
[348:12.88]What?
[348:13.44]What?
[348:13.78]What?
[348:28.92]I was about to quit the game.
[348:32.13]I don't care.
[348:49.96]Where am I getting communicated from?
[348:51.58]Okay, so why are you calling me, dude?
[348:53.28]Why are you leaving voicemails on my video?
[349:27.31]I did not rage quit Bugsnax.
[349:28.95]I was going to rage quit to the main menu so I could wake up in Bugsnaxville.
[349:41.84]Okay.
[349:43.38]Becca.
[349:45.44]Becca.
[349:46.62]I got... Here we go.
[349:51.86]Effica.
[349:54.39]Where are you?
[349:59.20]You're in here.
[350:00.64]Uh-huh.
[350:01.00]What's the final part of your quest?
[350:02.79]Guide to Scoopy Banoopy Omega Lull.
[350:29.08]Can't complete Scoopy Panoopy.
[350:32.35]Yeah, I don't care.
[350:33.15]Okay.
[350:55.57]Okay, I thought it was a gun.
[350:57.15]I thought it was a gun.
[350:58.01]I really did.
[350:58.85]That was a weird way to say the end, end that, and then, like, here comes, like, here's a gun.
[351:02.20]Like, I don't know why I thought that was, like, a gun.
[351:03.60]Okay.
[351:16.16]God damn it, I'm gonna get this scoopy-panoopy right now.
[351:42.73]Okay, one Scoopy Banoopy and then we'll turn that in.
[351:47.17]By that point, we'll be able to do the final part of Becca's quest line.
[351:50.89]And then whatever the end of this one is too.
[351:55.16]And then I will do the final party where we invite Lizbert to the fire.
[352:00.16]I'll take turns eating pieces of her body.
[352:04.95]I'm sure that's how it's going to end.
[352:12.08]Alright, Scooby-Banoopy, round two.
[352:14.04]Let's go.
[352:15.04]I'm gonna get ready for this.
[352:24.69]That's the goal.
[352:25.99]So we go right here.
[352:27.43]Alright, Scooby-Banoopy.
[352:41.61]Where is he?
[352:52.90]I don't see a Scoopy Banoopy anywhere.
[353:03.36]Reload.
[353:16.19]You hunted them to extinction.
[353:23.19]Speedrunners of this game must go absolutely nuts.
[353:28.57]When they don't get the spawn of the Scoopy Banoopy.
[353:43.16]Still no Scoopy Banoopy.
[353:53.19]No Scooby Banoopies.
[353:54.56]What the hell is that?
[354:05.17]What the hell is that thing?
[354:13.13]What are these things?
[354:14.11]Wait a minute, I'm gonna free them.
[354:35.30]I tried there's a stew guy in here what if I cut what does the stew guy like what if I cover alright I'm gonna cover the ice and hot sauce
[354:57.48]Go for it.
[354:58.02]Um... I don't know what to do.
[355:00.22]Set yourself on fire.
[355:27.95]Holy shit, it worked.
[355:35.83]What is this one?
[355:37.07]There you are!
[355:38.81]It's an egg roll!
[355:42.04]I just rescued you.
[355:45.36]The box protects its body, perhaps it can be grappled away.
[355:54.03]Alright, easy.
[356:03.26]Broke its neck.
[356:05.79]I did it.
[356:06.29]I got a new one.
[356:07.29]I've never seen that one before.
[356:12.89]What's in here?
[356:13.41]Get the stick bug?
[356:23.65]I think this is just... No.
[356:24.91]This is the burrito one.
[356:29.89]Yeah, we've seen these before.
[356:31.70]That's the Chilly Nilly.
[356:33.10]That's the Burrito Mantis.
[356:34.68]Are they just gonna fight each other?
[357:06.28]Oh, damn, they are fighting.
[357:07.28]Alright, well, you guys be good.
[357:09.86]Get along.
[357:10.88]Goodbye.
[357:11.20]Okay, Scoopy Banoopy.
[357:20.98]I need one Scoopy Banoopy, please.
[357:23.33]Please, please, please.
[357:29.11]None.
[357:35.64]Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.
[357:37.42]I have to sleep?
[357:39.36]Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
[357:44.42]For how long?
[357:44.94]Good night.
[357:54.47]The rest of your life.
[357:56.17]Oh my god.
[358:11.35]Alright.
[358:12.71]Scoopy Banoopy.
[358:20.66]There's a Scoopy Banoopy.
[358:22.32]I'm ready.
[358:24.04]I am ready.
[358:24.98]I was born ready for this moment.
[358:26.63]Hey, Scoopy.
[358:31.67]Come on over here.
[358:33.47]Get the fuck over here.
[358:36.79]You think that's funny?
[358:38.01]Turn around.
[359:05.19]Why does he have so much trouble going down these steps without... He can't!
[359:24.47]Okay, he's coming!
[359:25.59]He's coming!
[359:27.61]Ow!
[359:28.67]Come here, Scoopy!
[359:35.30]Alright, fuck it.
[359:36.06]Just go.
[359:36.98]Follow me.
[359:43.17]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[359:45.73]Thank you.
[360:06.33]He was sad.
[360:06.99]Yeah, it's just kind of sad because he's about to get eaten.
[360:15.00]Scoopy doopy.
[360:18.45]Scoopy.
[360:22.19]Doopy.
[360:35.29]Let's go.
[360:35.89]Yeah, let's go.
[360:41.97]Let's go.
[360:42.49]Let's go.
[360:47.38]Where's this guy?
[360:49.76]Oh, the mill.
[360:53.88]I've got your Scoopy Banoopy.
[360:59.63]This dude really is just the dessert guy.
[361:01.25]Okay.
[361:05.44]Mmm.
[361:18.88]I'm afraid that our success may provoke a counterattack from the Grumpinati.
[361:22.76]However, I have defenses prepared.
[361:24.88]Oh, well, almost prepared.
[361:27.18]I've set up flares around town.
[361:29.52]They should ward away any predator snacks looking to take action against us.
[361:33.70]Ward away, okay.
[361:34.68]I'm so glad you asked.
[361:36.12]Did you know that my trip shot can do more than, well, trip?
[361:40.02]It can also spread fires.
[361:41.80]Wow, I'm so excited for this.
[361:42.82]Scoopy-poopy.
[361:43.10]You should be able to light the rest of my flares.
[361:50.47]Alright, light all the flares.
[361:56.51]There's flare one.
[362:00.05]Flare number two.
[362:23.23]Fire.
[362:27.69]Fire.
[362:38.14]Fire.
[362:46.76]Fire.
[362:54.69]Off top.
[362:54.95]That's the plan.
[362:55.43]Okay, sorry.
[362:55.71]You scared me.
[363:22.57]Alright, now where's the other one?
[363:25.59]Fire, we need to light right here.
[363:29.34]Ow, actually I'm gonna burn this place.
[363:33.52]Somebody help!
[363:34.36]Help me!
[363:35.24]Help!
[363:49.59]Woah dude, you're gonna burn this place down!
[364:01.69]Two more.
[364:08.85]Where are you?
[364:14.44]Where are you?
[364:16.82]Up top.
[364:19.96]Okay, give me that.
[364:27.20]out of the house.
[364:31.52]We're good.
[364:35.18]Dude just runs in screaming on fire.
[364:38.64]That would not be cool.
[364:40.52]Okay, six.
[364:41.40]Where's the last one?
[364:44.99]Where's the last fire?
[364:49.41]Can we see it?
[364:57.65]In the garden?
[365:11.70]Oh, it is right there.
[365:12.30]You're right.
[365:12.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[365:24.93]Do you run faster?
[365:25.63]I feel like you do.
[365:28.91]I think it actually is like 5-10% faster.
[365:30.35]Okay.
[365:30.47]Here we go.
[365:48.92]This is another boss.
[365:49.42]This is definitely another boss.
[365:50.36]Cake boss.
[365:50.66]Sorry, I didn't know that was going to work.
[366:18.59]Alright, Frosted Peak, let's do it.
[366:24.82]It's gonna be a big cake.
[366:26.44]I'm actually looking forward to this.
[366:35.85]After this, we're gonna see if Becca has anything to finish.
[366:39.31]And then I'm gonna do the final celebration.
[366:45.53]That's the worst thing about the Grumpinati.
[366:48.25]No matter how many small victories I achieve, there's always another twisted clock to unravel.
[366:53.85]Always another danger around the corner.
[366:56.37]Oh, no, 100%.
[366:58.86]I gotta get some food.
[367:01.34]And I gotta get up, too.
[367:03.06]I'm breaking my rule.
[367:06.08]The four to six hour stream rule has been broken.
[367:09.56]You're almost there, chum.
[367:11.02]Gotta have to get up soon.
[367:13.22]Though you may need help lighting them.
[367:17.06]You're stronger now.
[367:18.02]Not so sure about that.
[367:19.21]Catch one daddy cake legs.
[367:41.88]In here?
[367:42.26]Jerma Daddy Cake.
[367:43.18]It's a birthday cake.
[367:44.28]This is a birthday candle.
[367:45.06]Alright, that's what this was.
[367:46.88]I was wondering what the mound was for.
[367:49.35]Happy birthday!
[368:07.83]Holy shit.
[368:08.63]Okay, scan it.
[368:10.81]This behemoth doesn't like having its candles lit.
[368:13.97]A flaming trick shot.
[368:15.73]Alright, doesn't like having the candles lit.
[368:21.71]Don't like to have the candles lit.
[368:28.19]How did you miss that?
[368:29.15]I don't- I didn't even aim that way.
[368:43.64]Oh, come on.
[368:54.38]There it is.
[368:56.09]I didn't light a candle.
[369:02.57]Did that work?
[369:09.79]Alright, got one.
[369:17.50]Get the other one.
[369:21.28]Why would you do that?
[369:23.04]I wouldn't even aim it over there.
[369:28.40]Say what?
[369:30.64]That's a giant enemy cake.
[369:33.02]That's not an enemy spider.
[369:34.04]That's a giant enemy cake.
[369:44.30]So, alright.
[369:45.00]Giant enemy cake.
[369:49.09]Did I light the other candle?
[370:03.94]What the hell just came out of him?
[370:09.10]Well, not to worry.
[370:10.74]According to my readings, it's still around here somewhere.
[370:13.20]What about those?
[370:13.96]Go find it and finish the job.
[370:17.49]Are you forgetting about these things?
[370:29.22]Baby cake legs.
[370:31.22]Recently cut from the cake.
[370:32.22]They seem to be seeking their master.
[370:36.36]Oh, I think we just... Oh, we follow them.
[370:37.52]Okay.
[370:48.18]Am I softlocking?
[370:55.29]Get off of that.
[371:04.63]He's not following me.
[371:08.45]Oh, fuck.
[371:09.51]I'm sorry.
[371:10.27]I didn't mean to.
[371:18.62]Oh, I missed the shot, Homer!
[371:20.80]I missed... I missed the shot, Homer!
[371:24.50]Is it not on fire?
[371:32.47]Why is it not on... Why is it not on fire?
[371:45.97]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[371:52.09]Shit, shit.
[371:53.21]Got it.
[372:00.24]That's two.
[372:00.68]Alright, blow up.
[372:22.81]He went far.
[372:38.44]I feel like I'm supposed to be doing this.
[372:39.65]Because he's breaking up into little pieces, right?
[373:01.67]Go on, kids!
[373:11.11]There's a fire.
[373:12.13]Ah, right here!
[373:24.58]Let's go!
[373:35.13]What a shot!
[373:36.91]Oh, what a shot that was.
[373:51.43]I want to pick up these guys, I think.
[373:57.51]He's on fire, though.
[373:58.15]I can't touch him.
[373:58.55]Alright, stop being on fire.
[374:01.03]Now.
[374:03.43]Oh, well, then just do this.
[374:10.94]Stop being on fire!
[374:11.88]I don't care.
[374:15.00]Alright, where is he?
[374:19.72]He didn't follow me around.
[374:21.37]He was stuck on the mountain.
[374:27.51]Where did he go?
[374:28.23]He's back in town?
[374:32.63]What about the trap?
[374:33.81]But they're on fire!
[374:40.46]I can't get them to not be on fire.
[374:41.72]See?
[374:44.96]Let's go!
[375:13.70]Whoa!
[375:37.58]Where is he?
[375:42.91]Did he actually get glitched and stuck on the side of the mountain?
[376:12.32]Here, eat this.
[376:13.48]I'm sure you'll love it.
[376:16.63]Wait, try this one first.
[376:23.95]That's just an upgraded marshmallow nose.
[376:38.05]Alright, very cool.
[376:39.39]Alright.
[376:40.85]Let's finish the game.
[376:43.23]Let's finish it.
[376:44.75]I did a lot of the fun stuff.
[376:48.35]If Becca does not have a complete my quest thing immediately, then I'm going to do the final celebration.
[376:54.79]That's it.
[377:01.45]Finish the quest line.
[377:02.51]I will.
[377:09.50]Alright, I'm about to give my... No, no, I'm not.
[377:11.68]I haven't finished yet.
[377:12.38]I haven't finished yet.
[377:22.81]I was about to give the final rating, but I want to see how the game ends.
[377:25.86]The ending has a very, very, very, very big influence on how I feel.
[377:35.06]Go chill.
[378:03.78]Alright, now everybody just stop it.
[378:06.68]But you also kept the whole birthday cake for yourself.
[378:13.52]Which, that's kind of a dick move already.
[378:16.74]And I'm the one that did all the work, and you didn't even share it with me.
[378:20.98]Who eats their entire birthday cake by themselves?
[378:23.65]A monster.
[378:24.77]That's who.
[378:25.07]You win.
[378:37.14]Alright, where's Becca?
[378:40.98]She's sleeping.
[378:45.21]Wake up.
[378:46.83]I keep forgetting she looks like this.
[379:01.45]Hey, alright, you wanna talk?
[379:03.69]No, no, I gotta go to the bathroom first.
[379:07.91]Alright, do you have nothing else for me?
[379:17.47]Let's see.
[379:18.15]Do you?
[379:23.31]No.
[379:24.91]I think that's it.
[379:28.19]That's it.
[379:28.63]Tiffany.
[379:31.85]Hello.
[379:33.98]Oh, the grandmother, right.
[379:35.44]We have to close this out.
[379:36.38]Are you good?
[379:36.66]Yeah, we got nothing from Becca.
[380:07.36]Alright, Tiffany, you got anything to close this out?
[380:09.46]I'm not doing too good.
[380:12.22]I'll never know what happened to my grandma.
[380:15.49]Froze to death on top of a mountain, looking for banana splits.
[380:21.51]Just like your fate, and like my fate, and everybody else in this godforsaken fucking camp.
[380:27.07]A place where you go to be forgotten.
[380:31.00]A place where I'll be forgotten.
[380:33.16]But, you know...
[380:34.80]Maybe at least the Bugsnax will remember me.
[380:42.44]Is that actually the end of your line here?
[380:47.93]Actually, that's kind of sad.
[380:56.33]Alright.
[380:58.89]We're not going to 100%.
[381:02.69]I'm going to sleep and see if there's anything else.
[381:05.39]And then I'm going to do the final celebration.
[381:14.91]I can't sleep in these beds.
[381:17.77]Why is that?
[381:22.35]I can't sleep in beds.
[381:28.05]Anybody?
[381:28.47]You got me?
[381:28.79]Oh, nobody got anything?
[381:33.73]Oh, I think that's it.
[381:35.87]Alright.
[381:40.18]Alright.
[381:44.90]That's it.
[381:45.34]That's it.
[381:46.28]I'm done.
[381:46.64]It was very fun.
[381:47.38]Yeah, I know she... But she has a whole quest log.
[381:50.24]I'm ready to start the party.
[381:52.60]I had my fun.
[382:05.92]Let's party.
[382:08.97]This is awesome!
[382:11.29]But it'll be even more awesome once everybody's on the dance floor!
[382:18.32]He finished Daidal's encounter.
[382:19.64]Yeah, Daidal's encounter took like four and a half hours to beat.
[382:24.00]One who is me has foreseen...
[382:27.76]The path to enlightenment is not walked with the feet.
[382:34.24]It is a journey taken with the mind.
[382:39.44]It felt like 24.
[382:40.24]I understand your wisdom, oh great Sheldah.
[382:44.58]You're saying I should chug this snack water upside down, dog!
[382:51.90]Yes!
[382:52.28]Yes!
[382:54.17]Yes!
[383:01.29]How's the party treating you, Baph?
[383:03.31]Eh, you've seen worse.
[383:05.81]Yeah, it's really coming together.
[383:07.79]It's nice to see everybody getting along.
[383:11.66]Listen, Philbo, I appreciate what you're doing, like getting everybody here.
[383:15.44]It's way less boring now.
[383:17.08]Actually, it's still pretty boring, though.
[383:20.09]They're just making nice because it's better than being alone.
[383:23.03]Sure, but who wants to be alone?
[383:25.62]Pickle Beth.
[383:29.35]Oh, they're gonna like each other.
[383:32.07]It's gonna be so cute.
[383:33.77]They're gonna dance together.
[383:39.29]I'm telling you, Bethrica, that like peacock schnoz you got going on.
[383:45.84]It's working.
[383:47.60]It really works for you.
[383:52.44]Wait, you haven't...
[383:57.04]Go dance.
[383:58.80]You're not weird.
[383:59.70]I want to give you pickle face and hamburger legs.
[384:05.36]Get everybody to dance.
[384:07.14]Let's go.
[384:07.46]Go dance.
[384:07.96]Um...
[384:22.78]Go dance.
[384:24.06]An orb cleaved.
[384:26.24]A snow of paper shards.
[384:29.40]So this must be before one dances.
[384:35.38]Get over there and dance.
[384:39.48]There's a party in my mouth and I'm invited.
[384:42.56]Don't ever say that out loud again.
[384:46.18]Looks like the two of us are really boned.
[384:49.22]Ha!
[384:53.76]You guys wanna dance?
[384:55.62]Yeah, let's go.
[384:56.06]We should go dance.
[384:58.88]Yes.
[384:58.98]Tell me.
[384:59.18]Didn't expect that, did you?
[385:00.54]Tell me everything.
[385:22.40]Back in like the fucking Incan times.
[385:24.62]Back when they were cavemen with throwing rocks at each other and trading teeth.
[385:28.36]Tell me about the history.
[385:29.86]Dance.
[385:30.12]You want booze?
[385:31.00]How do I get anybody to dance?
[385:51.63]Okay, how do I... Turn on... Change the song?
[385:54.91]How do I get them to do anything?
[386:00.47]I have to go give him alcohol.
[386:01.45]Pass out the alcohol.
[386:02.14]Wait, alright.
[386:02.66]I gave him the bug juice.
[386:04.00]I'm going to give it to him.
[386:04.82]Alright, here you go.
[386:06.60]Look at this.
[386:07.06]Alright.
[386:23.19]It's that easy.
[386:26.15]Much obliged, stranger.
[386:28.27]I better talk to Gramble before I lose my nerve.
[386:35.70]Woo!
[386:37.42]Hey, now, I don't want any trouble, Lambus.
[386:40.76]Gramble, I'm sorry.
[386:42.88]Wait, he walks up and just punches him in the face?
[386:44.74]Even worse to your little ones.
[386:47.84]You're serious?
[386:49.20]No fooling?
[386:50.46]I don't tell jokes, Gramble.
[386:52.66]I am not creative.
[386:56.39]Apology accepted.
[386:58.31]Now dance.
[386:58.83]Of course, no forgiving is complete without a hug.
[387:01.09]She always is dancing, so that's what 1 out of 11 is, right?
[387:03.90]But I suppose a dance couldn't hurt.
[387:09.28]Join them.
[387:09.86]What a fabulous party.
[387:12.18]It's no Grumpapalooza, but we make do.
[387:15.73]Let's go.
[387:15.99]Booze, you got it.
[387:16.53]Good.
[387:46.49]What about you?
[387:46.87]Why don't you go over there?
[387:47.59]Alright, what about you two?
[387:48.55]I owe you an apology, brother.
[387:51.68]My earlier insults were... Just get them all drunk.
[387:55.54]And then they'll finally dance.
[387:56.86]...in capturing research samples, and I appreciate that about you.
[388:01.83]Booze.
[388:01.99]Here.
[388:02.33]Give that back if you don't want it.
[388:03.67]Alright, I'll take it.
[388:36.19]You don't want it?
[388:41.89]What, I cracked like the egg above her?
[388:43.17]Alright, that worked.
[388:43.88]Uh, what about you?
[388:45.24]Here.
[388:58.62]How do I get you over there?
[389:02.32]Get over there.
[389:03.88]Alright.
[389:04.52]Only a few more.
[389:05.32]What about you?
[389:05.92]Here.
[389:07.04]Somebody take this, man.
[389:08.60]Somebody drink it.
[389:16.30]Without snorping.
[389:20.82]Flaming drink, bro.
[389:27.10]Drink it.
[389:30.32]I can't burn?
[389:31.70]Aw, soft lock burn.
[389:36.28]Oh, have fun.
[389:41.99]Look at them all enjoying themselves.
[389:44.13]I did this.
[389:44.81]This is my doing.
[389:46.11]I'm God here.
[389:49.61]I created the fun.
[389:50.83]I have something important to ask Chandler, but
[389:59.19]Such an annoying sibling of mine won't leave me be.
[390:03.91]You're interrupting personal business.
[390:05.68]Unless you have something intelligent to say, be gone.
[390:09.14]Rhythmic gyration has no purpose.
[390:14.18]Can you leave the party, then?
[390:16.08]Leave the fucking party.
[390:19.90]Turn it up!
[390:20.30]What about Tiffany?
[390:23.76]Go dance with... You should go talk to Flew.
[390:27.25]I bet Floofty will want to learn all about the desert empire's dance of certain death.
[390:32.15]He's doing Gangnam Style?
[390:33.43]He is.
[390:35.81]He actually is doing Gangnam Style.
[390:41.32]Okay, now we can have you leave.
[390:43.34]This is perfect.
[390:44.50]The desert dance mirrors the moves for hand-to-hand combat against Bugsnax.
[390:50.50]Thus, the youth were tricked into learning.
[390:54.13]Go go go go!
[390:54.91]Go go go go!
[390:55.77]Go go go go!
[391:21.56]Ahem.
[391:22.84]Chandlo, we've been together for so long, and I've always wondered how you feel about me.
[391:31.45]Do you want to be my boyfriend?
[391:34.21]What?
[391:35.35]Bro, that doesn't make any sense.
[391:38.40]Oh, I see.
[391:39.66]Wait, what?
[391:41.22]Never mind.
[391:42.42]Forget what I said.
[391:43.90]Snorpy, we've been dating for years.
[391:47.74]Wait, what?
[391:49.23]How is that possible?
[391:51.14]Dude, remember that time we made out on that Ferris wheel?
[391:55.52]You don't even know that you're, like, dating this guy?
[391:58.12]Yes, I just thought that we were roommates with benefits.
[392:02.56]You know I hate ambiguity.
[392:04.81]Sorry, snorp dog.
[392:08.75]Is that clear enough for you?
[392:12.27]Yeah.
[392:14.39]I love you, dog.
[392:16.11]Now let's dance.
[392:17.67]Get over there.
[392:18.67]Get over there, you two.
[392:24.79]Forget about it.
[392:25.57]Hey, what was that lady's name that fucking disappeared and died or something?
[392:30.29]Yeah, fuck her.
[392:30.97]Who cares?
[392:31.45]Let's go.
[392:33.16]Smile.
[392:50.83]Oh, look at that.
[392:51.57]Just absolutely destroying it.
[392:53.36]I'm going to talk to the mayor.
[393:01.74]Bilbo, we did it.
[393:02.70]We did it.
[393:07.34]We did it, buddy.
[393:08.09]We're all together again.
[393:10.91]Well, almost all of us.
[393:15.64]But you know what?
[393:16.68]What are you doing up here?
[393:19.16]I mean, none of this would have been possible without you, buddy.
[393:23.62]This is like a dog waiting for a treat.
[393:26.84]I'd sure miss you if you left.
[393:31.02]Did she say something?
[393:31.90]You still need to interview Lisper, right?
[393:34.08]Oh.
[393:35.64]She was just getting in place for her cue.
[393:40.04]Is that a metaphor?
[393:44.89]What the fuck?
[393:47.86]Is this the dark twist that everyone was talking about?
[393:52.96]The queen of Bugsnax?
[394:15.03]Figure out what to do now
[394:28.99]Volcano that's right wait.
[394:30.53]What oh bad timing suppose.
[394:33.58]We're gonna end up buried like all the others a death wing We can survive this as long as we got Bugsnax.
[394:42.02]We'll be fine my barn collapsed all of my little ones escaped
[394:49.00]Well, that was a lot of work for nothing.
[394:50.11]This stupid outfit.
[394:50.73]This funny nose.
[394:51.31]I can't take it seriously.
[394:53.97]This is a very dire, horrible situation.
[395:07.62]Wait, where did you come from?
[395:08.53]Doc?
[395:36.43]I'm glad you made it.
[395:37.41]Does that mean you figured it out?
[395:38.93]That's right, Philbo.
[395:40.27]I know how to get to Liz.
[395:41.60]That's amazing!
[395:43.48]We gotta go right away!
[395:44.38]Humpty Dumpty.
[395:48.20]Stop making me laugh.
[395:49.98]This is scary.
[395:52.08]Liz is in danger.
[395:53.92]This disaster is only getting started.
[395:56.80]The worst is yet to come.
[396:00.49]So spills forth the toxin unending.
[396:04.83]Quiet, you.
[396:06.80]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[396:08.46]I can't even... What the hell is happening right now?
[396:26.73]Y'all, we're gone.
[396:28.31]You prepare for the worst.
[396:29.95]What do we need right now?
[396:31.87]This is fucked up.
[396:33.73]This is people that have foods for their body parts.
[396:37.30]Talking about a terrible situation, but look at them.
[396:40.04]Whatever's out there, we'll see it coming.
[396:44.64]But what do we do when the queen comes to devour us?
[396:48.33]Well, I have a few prototype traps that I could put to use.
[396:52.47]How about the more practical threats?
[396:54.53]You know, the earthquakes, the volcanoes, and what have you.
[396:57.89]It's got a Spy Kids vibe.
[396:59.41]Find a way to get off the ground if the need arises.
[397:02.23]Well, none of that matters if I starve to death.
[397:05.09]We got ourselves.
[397:07.41]No way, pal.
[397:08.17]I ain't gonna chow down on that nasty plant goop.
[397:14.68]I stand corrected.
[397:16.00]No more concerns?
[397:17.22]Great.
[397:18.02]Let's get to it, then.
[397:21.93]Where are we going?
[397:22.81]Open the mysterious mountain door.
[397:29.31]I guess we're going.
[397:30.71]Why is everybody else not coming with us?
[397:33.27]Guys, when did it become... God damn it.
[397:37.03]Everybody agreed to do something and the three of us are the only ones that decided to do it.
[397:51.55]Team project, yeah.
[397:52.79]He didn't listen to a single thing.
[398:00.53]I was the cameraman.
[398:01.21]I had to concentrate on who was talking, not on what they were saying.
[398:04.83]You're such a weird guy, Philbo.
[398:49.76]What if there was a burger inside?
[398:51.46]MonkaS.
[398:52.20]That's my favorite comment so far.
[398:54.68]What if there was a burger inside?
[398:56.36]I don't know.
[398:58.02]What if there was a burger in there?
[398:59.88]Mountain.
[399:01.10]Still.
[399:02.34]Tall.
[399:04.42]Oh, do you need a break?
[399:06.41]How about water?
[399:07.03]Let me check your vitals.
[399:09.39]Oh, no.
[399:10.03]I'm okay.
[399:10.93]Besides, we're almost there.
[399:16.92]I'm going to play NASCAR with this motherfucker and get around.
[399:27.26]Don't do it.
[399:27.82]I have to.
[399:29.22]I have to do it.
[399:29.89]I have to do it.
[399:30.55]I have to.
[399:31.57]I have to do it.
[399:32.15]It doesn't work anyways.
[399:40.99]Alright.
[399:42.13]Wait, I stepped on it too early.
[399:44.85]Here we go.
[399:45.29]The big reveal.
[400:16.72]Ah.
[400:23.52]It was a trap.
[400:25.68]The under snacks.
[400:33.99]Everybody go.
[400:46.03]What the hell was that?
[400:58.24]What is this thing?
[400:59.16]Help!
[401:00.18]Bilbo, I'm coming.
[401:00.86]Just stay... I did see that thing.
[401:05.10]Remember I didn't... I... That thing appeared like four hours ago and I never took a photo of it.
[401:11.12]Is Egbo with you?
[401:12.00]I don't know how we all got separated.
[401:16.37]I'm ready with the camera next time.
[401:17.61]Go eat it.
[401:17.93]Jelly River.
[401:50.44]Carrot, I'll take it.
[401:53.69]Oh shit, wait.
[401:57.25]What?
[401:59.93]Snack Squatch.
[402:05.17]Wait, what the hell is this?
[402:07.74]You've become to- Wait, wait, wait.
[402:09.76]What, is this like the Council of Foods?
[402:28.76]Excuse me.
[402:29.22]Oh, Lisbert!
[402:34.95]It's you!
[402:35.63]You're alive!
[402:36.91]She's the whole... She's the pizza cake monster thing.
[402:39.31]Bilbo, you... Here.
[402:42.41]Oh, my... What the fuck?
[402:43.57]I can't believe it.
[402:45.25]We've got so much catching up to do.
[402:47.06]I... I wish I could.
[402:49.96]Aren't you... But we're out of time.
[402:52.16]You have to get out of here.
[402:54.25]You have to gather up the others and get off the island.
[402:58.11]Okay, then we can talk on the way back.
[403:00.71]No, Philbo.
[403:02.81]I can't go with you like this.
[403:05.73]I'm so sorry.
[403:06.80]Philbo, are you not understanding?
[403:10.04]This is not freaking you out at all, Philbo.
[403:13.30]She's embedded inside of this fucking trunk that's put into the cake, that's put into the pizza, that's put into the frog and the bog and the bog and the lake and the bottom of the sea.
[403:22.68]Seriously?
[403:23.48]Trying to interview me right now?
[403:27.91]Kinda.
[403:30.67]I regret inviting you.
[403:33.17]You came here to interview Elizabeth Megafig?
[403:36.88]Fine.
[403:38.10]Keep it quick.
[403:40.67]First of all, what is this?
[403:42.19]Oh no, what are they?
[403:44.27]What is a Bugsnag?
[403:45.13]Here it comes.
[403:46.78]It's like the soul of a deceased child in another reality.
[404:06.15]Oh, never mind.
[404:07.25]So they're not cute and cuddly?
[404:35.23]They have parasites.
[404:36.59]This is what's left of everybody who came before us.
[404:39.95]Of every living thing that wasn't Bugsnax.
[404:43.68]They always win.
[404:46.74]Well, why are you like this?
[404:48.74]After I saved Degabel, I fell into this place.
[404:52.42]Before I knew what was happening, I was swarmed.
[404:55.28]Bugsnax were crawling down my throat.
[404:58.29]They tried to erase me.
[405:00.53]To make me into them.
[405:02.87]That's horrible.
[405:04.44]Look at how cute they are.
[405:05.62]But somehow I pushed back.
[405:10.14]I made them into me.
[405:15.12]So that Bugsnack Golem monster is you.
[405:18.00]That's right.
[405:19.38]I'm sorry if I scared you.
[405:21.28]I just wanted to make everyone leave this awful place.
[405:24.60]But I can't make Bugsnacks talk.
[405:29.48]So the Bugsnax are under control.
[405:31.14]Why did your nose change?
[405:34.63]It actually is the Lich King.
[405:35.33]Didn't we- wait, didn't we make that reference in that joke?
[405:37.55]Like, yesterday afternoon?
[405:58.98]That's actually what is going on.
[406:01.10]There must always be a Bugsnax queen.
[406:05.10]Ow.
[406:15.08]Okay, I'm just... Alright, hold on.
[406:16.48]I gotta tell you.
[406:18.70]The price of the game rating is going up until about one minute ago.
[406:36.99]I'm not good at stuff, and everybody hates me, but you?
[406:41.56]They love you, Lizbert.
[406:44.40]They love the idea of me.
[406:46.36]The idea of me?
[406:47.22]I'm sorry I put so much on your shoulders, Bilbo.
[406:50.36]But you, you are the one who can bring them together.
[406:54.08]Me?
[406:55.48]Well, I'm the one who made it all fall apart.
[406:59.12]What are you saying?
[407:01.44]I led you to this terrible island.
[407:04.16]I filled your bodies with parasites what I ignored all the warning signs I Didn't understand what any of you really needed so now I'm taking responsibility for my mistakes I'll keep the Bugsnax at bay long enough for everyone to escape
[407:21.43]Liz, no, no, no.
[407:23.39]There has to be some other way we can help you.
[407:26.74]No.
[407:27.70]I should be the only one to suffer the consequences of my actions.
[407:31.30]Nobody else needs to get hurt because of me.
[407:38.79]Where have I heard that before?
[407:40.63]Don't eat those.
[407:41.27]Don't touch those.
[407:43.17]You shouldn't be here.
[407:44.51]You need to get away.
[407:47.30]Get up.
[407:48.34]Get up.
[407:48.98]Start eating her.
[407:49.82]Let's go.
[407:50.38]Get up.
[407:51.38]Hey.
[407:52.32]Ow.
[407:53.22]Eggabelle.
[407:54.05]Stop it.
[407:54.89]I could burn her.
[407:55.35]I got a torch back here that I could connect to.
[407:56.95]I didn't sleep in an igloo for months just so you could play martyr.
[408:01.01]We're getting out of here together.
[408:04.95]I can't.
[408:06.37]My control is already slipping.
[408:09.05]If I step outside this cave, my connection to the bug site will break and the island will collapse before I make it another step.
[408:16.98]Huh.
[408:18.16]Alright.
[408:18.98]Then I'll get in there with you.
[408:20.28]I can't believe that.
[408:21.98]Move over?
[408:23.62]It's not a car, Bill.
[408:30.28]What the fuck is going on?
[408:32.03]Oh, the price is falling.
[408:34.13]The price is in a free fall.
[408:35.53]It's crashing.
[408:37.43]The price is crashing right now.
[408:39.01]A lot of people are starting to sell as of right now.
[408:52.71]It does make you look a bit dangerous So how long before the island explodes oh?
[409:01.93]I don't know my investment I bought in when it was $100.
[409:09.01]I bought it when it was 84 rating a share What is it now?
[409:14.17]I don't even want to look at it.
[409:15.25]We've been through worse than this Right we both survived so much by ourselves
[409:21.46]Imagine what we can do when we're together.
[409:24.32]Okay.
[409:25.41]Good luck.
[409:26.31]And I'll see you again someday.
[409:28.63]It's time to get moving.
[409:31.61]Get back to Snacksburg.
[409:33.51]You're going to have to take a bit of a shortcut.
[409:36.09]Hold on.
[409:36.63]I thought that just said, learn the tutorial.
[409:41.03]I don't know why.
[409:44.77]Oh, I...
[409:55.10]We gotta get out of here.
[409:55.70]We gotta warn everybody.
[410:00.80]You're on your own, dude.
[410:02.16]You heard what they said.
[410:05.62]Agable?
[410:07.22]Is that you?
[410:08.64]Oh, sorry, buddy.
[410:10.93]Head hurt.
[410:11.95]Oh, bad.
[410:13.07]Not dream time yet.
[410:15.61]Gotta save... friends...
[410:19.13]Back to the beginning.
[410:19.87]It's the beginning.
[410:25.65]But, no, it's not.
[410:32.53]Put it down.
[410:33.87]Put down the Bugsnax.
[410:35.75]You don't understand.
[410:36.65]It's people.
[410:37.43]It's made out of people.
[410:41.15]Stop eating it.
[410:46.62]don't eat the bunker I can't believe you just streamed a pump and dump scheme
[411:19.20]Ugh.
[411:23.52]Escape from Snaktooth, quick, let's go!
[411:25.50]Dead.
[411:27.26]All dead.
[411:27.60]All of them.
[411:48.40]They're holding off the swarm as best they can.
[411:50.20]I've supplied them with all my most dangerous inventions.
[411:53.36]That'll only buy us time.
[411:55.34]Snorfdog!
[411:56.62]They're coming down from the mountain!
[411:58.74]I need you here, now!
[412:01.27]Hold steady, my love.
[412:02.59]Get the minigun.
[412:03.41]Oh, but somebody needs to finish fueling the balloon.
[412:06.89]Don't worry, Snorby.
[412:07.82]Leave the balloon to me.
[412:09.06]Go and help Chandler.
[412:10.70]Splendid.
[412:11.78]As for you, you may need my snack chop.
[412:14.28]It's much like the snack trap if it were set to, uh, puree.
[412:18.60]Good luck.
[412:22.24]Okay.
[412:23.42]This looks simple enough.
[412:30.99]Let's just get the nuke.
[412:44.90]Defend Filbo.
[412:56.81]Okay, so they're evil bugs.
[412:59.87]They're parasites and they're going to kill us.
[413:06.00]I liked it better when we were just dancing around a campfire looking around for the lady that was lost.
[413:10.24]Help Sheldon and Flutie.
[413:24.33]But they were so cute, though.
[413:25.13]Remember when you force-fed the sleepwalking guy parasites against his will?
[413:28.60]Well, first of all, I didn't know that he was sleepwalking, and second of all, I didn't know they were parasites.
[413:50.50]Here comes someone with a healthy capacity for violence.
[413:53.36]Take this device and clear a path for us, please.
[413:56.71]Go.
[414:04.25]This just became another... So there really is the dark twist.
[414:08.19]You guys weren't fucking around.
[414:09.59]You weren't supposed to eat that.
[414:20.39]You weren't supposed to eat that.
[414:26.64]Bad ending.
[414:27.70]She ate one.
[414:28.26]She's gonna turn.
[414:29.52]That doesn't even hurt, see?
[414:46.28]You're fine.
[414:52.13]Everyone seems to be fine.
[414:53.27]Dude, okay, you wouldn't drink, like, four bottles of vodka in one sitting, so don't eat, like, four cases of Bugsnax in one sitting.
[415:03.76]Bugsnax in moderation seems to be okay.
[415:08.38]Come on, Snacks.
[415:10.23]Let's see what you got.
[415:12.43]Uh, Tom, over here.
[415:14.07]I've just finished another device.
[415:15.81]The trip drone.
[415:16.93]With this, we can hold off the bug, Snacks, and escape before Chandler collapses.
[415:21.43]Don't worry, Snort Dog.
[415:22.95]I can do this all day.
[415:26.96]Oh, you beautiful fool.
[415:29.12]I'll pilot the drone.
[415:30.28]You aim the shot.
[415:31.90]Unfortunately, we're short on connective surfaces.
[415:34.86]How about this?
[415:36.68]Helioop!
[415:41.04]Alright, here we go.
[415:42.92]Oh, he's not gonna eat it!
[416:07.87]Get dunked on!
[416:20.86]Prevent them from going by.
[416:22.38]Hey, suit!
[416:26.72]I need a thing to get attached to.
[416:41.21]Thank you!
[416:42.05]Finally threw one!
[416:42.69]Out, out!
[416:43.15]Everybody run!
[416:43.77]Help, Befica, and Cromdo.
[416:45.49]Oh, they're two of my least favorite characters in the game.
[416:49.77]Oh, we can't just run by them.
[416:50.67]Okay.
[417:05.20]smoke is making my eyes water don't worry there's one thing I'm good at it's looking for trouble speaking up snacks at three o'clock you got it fire in the hole nice shot who knew snack water was so flammable huh it's almost a shame to waste it like
[417:29.16]You know what really is a shame is the fact that we stopped eating Bugsnax and don't do Bugsnax cosmetics when you look like that.
[417:38.43]Cromdo can pick up the speed on those barrels.
[417:40.89]Can't you, Cromdo?
[417:42.01]Like, oh, wait, I can't eat, like, one of the cakes and get, like, a regular cake nose.
[417:47.77]I mean, I've already gotten this far, I think.
[417:51.98]Can I do another one?
[417:53.22]Eat maybe one or two more?
[417:54.66]Here, take this.
[417:58.46]There you go.
[418:06.41]Come on.
[418:08.31]Don't eat that.
[418:11.21]Actually, maybe you should eat that.
[418:13.52]Load it up!
[418:14.20]I don't think you can, Liz.
[418:19.25]Here, take this.
[418:34.17]You did finish their quests.
[418:37.37]Yeah.
[418:37.73]Hey, Becca.
[418:38.57]Anybody want to spy on right now?
[418:41.24]Great opportunity.
[418:42.20]We're in the middle of a total panic.
[418:43.72]I could really find some secrets.
[418:45.70]Oh, that's heavy.
[418:46.28]There you go.
[418:50.18]Another one for you.
[418:56.16]Oh, my back.
[418:57.46]Oh, that's heavy.
[418:58.08]Here, take this.
[418:58.58]There you go.
[419:04.02]Can we stop?
[419:05.38]What?
[419:20.23]Did she take a picture of me?
[419:23.37]Put the camera down.
[419:31.82]Oh, it looked pretty nasty for a sec, but I knew you'd pull through, bestie.
[419:37.03]We made it!
[419:38.77]That means Snorpy owes me five bucks.
[419:41.09]Let's blow this popsicle stand, huh?
[419:46.88]Oh, wiggle and gramble.
[419:52.60]Runaway snacks never come back.
[419:56.29]Oh.
[419:58.59]I don't get it.
[419:59.71]Why are the little ones attacking us?
[420:01.96]They're like a mob of adored
[420:07.96]So wait, that means his friend in the ball is evil.
[420:11.57]Even so, I can't bring myself to hurt him.
[420:16.01]So why'd Snorpy have to go and weaponize Sprout?
[420:19.79]Ramble, I didn't know you were so punk rock.
[420:23.14]I'm not a punk or a rock.
[420:26.02]I can't do this.
[420:28.74]Well, I know who can.
[420:31.40]I have a name.
[420:32.40]I've got them all warmed up.
[420:34.04]It's time for you to bring the house down.
[420:39.45]Alright.
[420:41.25]Go that way.
[420:41.97]Whoa.
[421:12.41]Grandma hates Bugsnax.
[421:18.20]No.
[421:18.48]No, I don't.
[421:19.85]Oh, man.
[421:21.17]I bought in right at the top.
[421:23.57]I really did.
[421:39.43]It's very good.
[421:40.29]It's a very, very good game.
[421:41.85]I loved it.
[421:43.91]But we are going to have to take a few points off for the, like... We have to have a twist ending.
[421:53.81]A few points have to be taken off.
[422:00.28]And... And... These games here at the end...
[422:08.15]This is not, this is not fun.
[422:11.87]Like I wanted to be done with this portion of what I'm doing right now, like 10 to 15 minutes ago.
[422:16.49]Can we do it?
[422:22.90]Is it over?
[422:31.24]Please say it's over.
[422:32.90]My heart can't take much more of this.
[422:35.37]Oh, you love Bugsnax?
[422:36.65]Name every bug snack.
[422:38.51]Uh, strawberry.
[422:42.47]Carrot bug.
[422:44.05]Watermelon boss.
[422:46.13]Cake.
[422:47.27]Big cake.
[422:49.41]Burger.
[422:50.39]Barbecue burger.
[422:51.93]Potato.
[422:52.61]Sweet potato.
[422:53.23]French fry.
[422:53.79]Sweet potato fry.
[423:01.87]Scoopy panoopy.
[423:04.42]I could do them all.
[423:07.30]I said Bunger.
[423:08.66]I said BBQ Bunger and I said Bunger.
[423:10.56]Popsicle, yeah.
[423:11.06]Okay.
[423:36.68]Special sauce.
[423:40.19]Alright, get this special sauce and then they'll kill each other.
[423:44.29]Uh... What happens if there's only one left?
[424:12.12]Oh.
[424:12.68]That's what happens.
[424:13.22]Okay, we just eat one.
[424:27.70]Quick!
[424:28.22]To the boat!
[424:30.06]To the flying boat.
[424:31.02]That's about as big a break as we're gonna get.
[424:34.22]Come on, Whamby.
[424:35.27]It's now or never.
[424:39.18]Where is home?
[424:48.02]Get on the balloon.
[424:48.74]They're going to break.
[424:50.60]The two of them are going to break up through the ground in their weird elephant trunk bodies and be like, get out quick.
[424:57.13]Did I kill you?
[425:08.81]Yeah, we're gonna get a T-Rex from Jurassic Park ending.
[425:13.59]Where the T-Rex actually saves them, right?
[425:17.28]Told you.
[425:41.38]Can I take a picture?
[425:44.72]I can't.
[425:45.40]Use the camera.
[426:04.98]It's been 12 years.
[426:07.36]Think back on that time.
[426:08.52]That Bugsnack Island.
[426:10.77]Think back of the funny faces.
[426:14.03]I turned your face into a straw.
[426:15.76]Gave you a pretzel for a head.
[426:17.34]Turned you into a fast food logo.
[426:21.48]Think about how painful your face probably is right now.
[426:26.88]I think about your songs.
[426:28.41]How they made me laugh.
[426:31.11]Some of them.
[426:32.49]Most of them were terrible.
[426:33.31]And you.
[426:37.17]I see a lot of you in me.
[426:38.27]Especially that hat.
[426:42.65]And you.
[426:44.01]I'll never forget that face.
[426:47.71]And you.
[426:48.10]Wait, actually talk to them?
[426:49.34]Oh, right.
[426:51.92]Well, there goes another farm.
[426:55.89]Serves me right for building it on top of an island-sized pest.
[427:02.03]I guess there's no shame in starting fresh.
[427:05.43]I'll find a place with rich soil.
[427:08.79]I am.
[427:10.95]Me and Triffy can settle down.
[427:16.55]Dude, did you see that?
[427:18.73]That was kind of like a side-eye.
[427:20.45]Wait a minute.
[427:20.99]I don't know about that.
[427:22.36]What about the Tiffany cactus?
[427:24.52]Yeah, uh...
[427:46.15]My friend, I don't think it's appropriate to take around, like, the cactus sex doll of your wife.
[427:54.15]Still.
[427:55.90]I just, like, plant it.
[427:57.34]Plant it somewhere and, like, take all this off and let it just grow.
[428:03.36]You don't find that a little weird?
[428:05.47]Like, Tiffany, that's not a little weird to you.
[428:17.98]Pink Shame Andy?
[428:24.95]No, I'm just saying he's carrying around a doll of you with you around.
[428:30.81]You're going to get jealous of the doll.
[428:34.66]You're going to be like, you got that fucking doll every day?
[428:36.70]It's me.
[428:39.48]I'm not good enough?
[428:40.32]I'm not as good as the doll?
[428:42.32]Well, I mean, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[428:44.82]No, I don't.
[428:48.24]I thought I'd be real sad when I left all my- Of course you are.
[428:52.04]Of course you are, Goku.
[428:54.11]Okay.
[428:54.53]I don't know.
[428:56.69]Maybe it helps they tried to murder me.
[428:59.09]But also, I got folks who love me back for real.
[429:03.47]Like, well, Wiggle.
[429:11.54]Alright, I have to just not look at the screen while you talk.
[429:14.59]Hey, bestie.
[429:15.41]It didn't work.
[429:15.99]I'm still thinking.
[429:16.61]I can see it.
[429:17.01]I need a vacay from this vacay.
[429:21.09]Going home doesn't seem so bad anymore.
[429:24.89]My old life.
[429:26.45]My old friends.
[429:27.35]They're all gone.
[429:29.95]But like, now I know that I can make new friends.
[429:35.60]And this time, I won't ruin it for myself.
[429:48.41]Gotta remember you.
[429:48.93]I don't want to hear everybody's end of their laugh.
[429:55.98]Check the boat.
[430:21.23]Why check the boat?
[430:22.10]Nothing on the boat.
[430:23.72]Thanks.
[430:24.48]Thanks for padding the ending of the game.
[430:31.82]I'll be very honest, I don't even want to hear your end of your, whatever your last four dialog pieces are, because I didn't even care about you in the entire game.
[430:39.05]I didn't do any of your side quests.
[430:40.25]I don't even know who you are.
[430:41.47]While I regret that all my research was destroyed, I have come away with a revelation.
[430:46.60]I cannot improve Grumpus Kind if I refuse to understand it.
[430:51.10]It may be a long and frankly annoying endeavor, but it is one worth pursuing.
[430:55.69]Oh, right.
[430:57.79]She ate one of the donuts accidentally.
[430:59.09]Now you have a donut hand.
[431:01.51]Same thing with you.
[431:02.01]I don't even know who you are either.
[431:03.03]I kind of know you.
[431:04.73]I wish I hadn't wasted so much time telling riddles.
[431:09.92]I don't need to be all powerful to give good advice.
[431:12.90]I just need to be me.
[431:16.48]And those who listen will listen.
[431:29.93]muggling shitload back home apparently.
[431:37.16]They don't even know I'm taking them back with us.
[431:40.50]I'm gonna spread this around the world.
[431:43.84]They're gonna take over real soon.
[431:47.63]We're gonna have to go to customs.
[431:49.87]I'm gonna get stopped at the border.
[431:55.29]Except for anything that requires fingers or toes.
[431:58.03]That's off limits for now.
[432:25.49]Hey, buddy.
[432:26.29]Are you ready to go?
[432:31.26]Alright, everybody.
[432:32.14]Or three people?
[432:33.32]What do you mean three people?
[432:38.91]Liz and Egg.
[432:39.69]What if they're still out there?
[432:55.92]They'll be fine.
[432:59.79]Or smelling.
[433:03.61]Right?
[433:03.85]Because all their noses are like fruits and vegetables.
[433:07.54]Or hearing.
[433:13.66]Or thinking.
[433:14.32]This is like implanted in their brains.
[433:21.17]No, you're right.
[433:22.91]Nobody should ever set foot on Snaktooth Island again.
[433:25.78]What do we do about it?
[433:28.46]I know.
[433:29.14]I can't go wallowing in regret now.
[433:31.60]We're barely even out of the woods.
[433:33.82]It's gonna take a while for the Bugsnax to wear off on us.
[433:37.40]I can't go back home like this, so... Is it alright if I stay with you for a while?
[433:42.72]Absolutely not.
[433:44.44]Maybe figure out which parts to tell, or...
[433:47.12]I... Absolutely not.
[433:50.02]I got a one bedroom.
[433:51.97]One bathroom.
[433:53.29]No.
[433:54.45]I'm sorry.
[433:58.36]But you know what?
[433:58.94]Sure.
[433:59.50]Great.
[434:00.78]Let's go.
[434:16.35]Just one more for the road.
[434:31.10]Release them.
[434:31.72]No, I'm taking them home with me.
[434:42.91]I have to admit, you got guts.
[434:45.77]Tracking down Elizabeth inside an erupting volcano?
[434:49.12]It's compelling, dramatic, sensational.
[434:53.06]I'd call it fiction if you didn't have this Philipus Yahoo along as a witness.
[434:58.60]It's Philbo, actually.
[435:00.50]Point is, you're a regular grumpter as Thompson.
[435:04.01]It's just too bad those Bugsnax weren't real, huh?
[435:08.31]Yeah, too bad.
[435:09.27]Yeah, too bad.
[435:13.51]Hey, would you like a gummy worm, Clumpy?
[435:15.47]Okay, that's...
[435:37.90]Thanks.
[435:38.12]Why'd you say that?
[435:38.66]Why'd you say that?
[435:39.36]What the hell?
[435:39.96]Don't say that.
[435:40.47]You just fucked up my whole stream.
[436:13.97]Bugsnax!
[436:16.27]By Kevin Zun, Christopher Stallman, Megan Vardy, John Murphy, Rice Pulse, Kevin Geisler, Devin Scott-Tuncan.
[436:26.48]This is the song!
[436:39.79]Okay.
[436:41.43]So, here's, here's the deal.
[436:46.89]climbed up.
[436:47.81]I'm going to give you what I think.
[436:50.14]We hit peak yesterday afternoon, yesterday night.
[436:54.22]77, 78, 79.
[436:54.98]79 by this afternoon.
[436:55.46]80, 81, 82, 83, 84 before we got to that last room.
[436:56.52]84.
[436:57.24]I was about to lock in in 84.
[436:58.60]I was about to lock it in.
[437:14.05]And then, I wasn't a huge fan of the ending.
[437:16.95]I mean, they tried to do something interesting.
[437:18.45]It came down to 83, 82, 81, 80.
[437:19.13]79, 78, came down to 78.
[437:19.60]Came all the way down to 78, and it evened out there.
[437:28.58]It actually, the candle wicked at 75, let's be honest.
[437:45.87]Is this all the voice actors?
[437:48.87]That's cool.
[437:52.37]But then we had a little bit of a bounce off the 75.
[437:58.69]76, 77, 78.
[438:00.47]And we settled at 78.
[438:01.91]I think it's a good game.
[438:06.62]It's very good.
[438:11.76]It was very, very interesting.
[438:12.92]Very cute.
[438:13.40]Very different.
[438:14.68]I really liked it.
[438:16.69]This is a 78.
[438:17.01]It hit like 84 somewhere.
[438:17.99]It was around 79.
[438:21.47]You know what?
[438:37.56]I can't give it an 80, though.
[438:38.94]I can't, I cannot, because it's like, it's so, it's so easy to say 80.
[438:42.57]Everything's an 8 out of 10.
[438:45.65]Everything's an 8 out of 10.
[438:46.55]Every game's an 8 out of 10, right?
[438:52.94]So just say 81.
[438:53.50]That's true.
[438:54.52]Alright, I'm gonna give you a range.
[438:57.44]Somewhere between 78 and 81.
[438:59.20]That's where this game lies for me.
[439:06.04]It was very good.
[439:06.82]It was very enjoyable.
[439:07.96]I liked it a lot.
[439:09.41]I wouldn't have streamed it for seven and a half hours today and yesterday too.
[439:14.45]I loved it.
[439:15.95]But I didn't super love it.
[439:25.10]It's an 81.
[439:25.50]Done.
[439:27.88]No, it's not.
[439:28.28]It's an 80.
[439:29.30]No, it's not.
[439:29.60]It's an 81.
[439:29.84]79.5.
[439:29.88]It's a 79.8.
[439:36.93]I can't tell.
[439:37.35]I can't make my decision.
[439:38.05]It's a 78.
[439:38.21]79.4.
[439:38.23]Done.
[439:38.35]79.5.
[439:38.37]It just got a blend.
[439:38.91]Yeah.
[439:39.11]There's like a weird, creepy ending here.
[439:41.43]We're getting a second one. 79.5.
[440:18.24]but jokes aside with the extra you know with the the score uh the game's 25 bucks it was that was incredibly enjoyable it was very very good it was great I got what I I got my 25 dollars worth
[440:38.27]12 plus hours of cute monsters and funny characters and it was great.
[440:44.17]I will give a stamp on recommend on this one.
[440:46.09]I thought it was very good.
[440:55.40]A dollar an hour.
[440:56.96]You can't get a deal like that at very many places.
[441:03.37]And that's where we're going to end tonight.
[441:06.16]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[441:07.00]This is a long one.
[441:08.62]I kind of broke my rules here.
[441:10.57]But I'm okay.
[441:17.07]Uh, $50 just came in.
[441:18.91]5,000 bits.
[441:20.65]From Goiki, and he says, This game is great.
[441:23.27]Fuck you for even as much as insinuating anything different.
[441:26.80]Anyways, here's $50.
[441:27.48]Well, thank you.
[441:28.80]Thanks.
[441:29.14]$79 is good.
[441:36.42]I remember it hit 85 at some point.
[441:41.96]I don't just rate games based on just here's a flat rating.
[441:45.19]You guys know this.
[441:46.65]Resident Evil 7.
[441:48.47]I will defend my score.
[441:50.25]I do not give games a rating.
[441:52.11]I give them a rating based on where I currently am.
[441:55.52]The first four hours of Resident Evil 7 was a 90.
[441:59.53]Hour number three through five was like a three.
[442:02.59]And then, like, the last two hours was like a 60.
[442:04.53]70.
[442:05.11]Remember?
[442:06.39]Like, I... I rate games differently than other people.
[442:19.96]What is a 95 game?
[442:20.48]Half-Life 2.
[442:24.36]No, that's not even accurate.
[442:25.10]I think Half-Life Alyx is better than Half-Life 2.
[442:27.89]Half-Life Alyx is better than Half-Life 2.
[442:29.35]I just said it out loud with 10,000 people here.
[442:32.11]Hope I don't die.
[442:32.65]I hope I'm not like... I hope I don't get incinerated by the gaming god.
[442:50.14]Gamer Satan is going to come out of my ground and electrocute me to death.
[443:01.29]The Reddit council, MonkaS.
[443:06.21]I love Half-Life.
[443:06.87]It's a great series.
[443:08.73]I think Half-Life Alyx is the most fun I've had in a Half-Life game though.
[443:12.21]But it's not really fair because it's this new crazy technology and Half-Life 2 is like fucking 15 years old.
[443:18.97]Not fair.
[443:21.68]But that's going to be it.
[443:22.86]I will see you guys in a few days.
[443:24.58]What's today?
[443:26.64]Sunday.
[443:28.01]Let's see.
[443:31.67]Monday, Tuesday.
[443:34.39]Probably Wednesday or Thursday.
[443:36.49]I'll see you guys either Wednesday or Thursday.
[443:37.71]Keep an eye on the sauce over the next day or so.
[443:39.25]I'll give you a good date.
[443:42.19]Bugsnax.
[443:43.77]Delicious.
[443:48.09]So Thursday.
[443:48.79]Right.
[443:49.01]Just assume Thursday.
[443:50.01]Always.
[443:52.21]We're gonna sow the credits here.
[443:55.90]All the community subs, all the gifted subs, thanks guys.
[444:01.22]I just... Okay, I open up tabs when I open up images that you guys link.
[444:07.30]And... They scare the shit out of me sometimes, I just... This was just the second tab that I clicked on.
[444:18.73]I'm blocking the credits.
[444:24.64]It was very good.
[444:25.32]I'm happy to have played Bugsnax.
[444:27.18]They did a great job.
[444:43.35]Who's your favorite character?
[444:44.27]Uh, Bobsicle.
[444:50.47]Bobsicle's my favorite character.
[444:59.54]What about your favorite Grumpus?
[445:01.77]Uh, Wiggly.
[445:02.31]We already know that.
[445:02.77]Would I play the sequel if it came out?
[445:05.47]Yeah, absolutely.
[445:06.95]The character design and the actual game design with just looking at the Bugsnax was the most fun part of the whole game.
[445:14.50]And obviously this team has enough creative juices to make these awesome, funny, cute little monster food items.
[445:21.92]So I would love to see more of that.
[445:38.22]Wait, how do you do a second one if you know that they're not cute?
[445:40.84]That's true.
[445:43.34]Yeah, how do you do a second one when everyone knows the twist?
[445:50.18]Okay, Jedi Academy.
[445:52.67]I don't know, maybe... Should we do Jedi Academy next stream?
[445:57.65]This week?
[446:05.95]I think the book is out on this one.
[446:07.95]People either really, really don't want me to do this or they really, really, really do.
[446:20.75]No more kitty bullshit.
[446:24.75]Come on.
[446:25.56]Come on.
[446:28.66]Dude, what do you mean?
[446:30.22]No more kitty bullshit.
[446:33.50]House Flipper VR.
[446:34.54]I'm taking a break from VR.
[446:41.52]I'm taking a break from VR.
[446:43.98]No VR.
[446:44.68]Hey, Dallas.
[447:00.61]No more Star Wars games.
[447:02.43]Alright, but hold on.
[447:05.17]I have to finish.
[447:07.98]I have to finish at least Lego Star Wars.
[447:09.94]Give me that one.
[447:11.32]Please.
[447:16.65]We can all agree on that, right?
[447:19.57]And I will play Sly Cooper as well.
[447:28.95]Alright, please be honest with me.
[447:30.69]Is Sly Cooper a Ratatouille thing where everyone's just saying that and then when I actually buy this game and set it up and capture it, everyone's gonna be like, fuck this game, this game sucks, stop playing it.
[447:43.86]Is this a Ratatouille 2 thing where everyone just says it because it's a meme?
[447:48.13]No.
[447:51.38]Alright.
[447:52.36]I'm gonna get it, and we're gonna do it next week.
[447:54.24]You understand?
[447:54.86]I'm gonna get Sly Cooper.
[447:56.68]Sly Cooper 1.
[447:58.64]And I'm gonna play it next week.
[448:04.37]I'll see you later.
[448:04.85]Let's, uh... Let's raid somebody.
[448:07.65]Let's raid... Hmm... Let's raid Criken.
[448:11.81]It's been a long time since we raided Criken.
[448:18.86]What's he doing?
[448:19.88]Gary's mod.
[448:25.33]Solver squad and the mystery of the broken bunker.
[448:27.76]That's a mouthful.
[448:28.36]I wonder what they're doing.
[448:31.30]What about the emotes?
[448:33.14]Oh, yeah, I owe you guys a bunch of emotes.
[448:37.08]I do owe you guys a bunch of emotes.
[448:39.26]I bet you'll never see them.
[448:43.30]No, you will.
[448:47.19]Thanks a lot, guys.
[448:47.59]I'll see you in a few days.
[448:48.55]See you probably on Thursday.
[448:50.01]Have a great rest of your night.
[448:50.81]Have a great rest of your evening.
[448:51.91]Have a wonderful day.
[448:56.08]Thank you so much for watching.
[448:59.49]We'll see you soon.
[449:01.29]Good night.
[449:01.89]Goodbye.
[449:02.23]Take care.
[449:38.65]you
