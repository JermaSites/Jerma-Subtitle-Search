[ve:61.1.100]

[00:38.34]Hey, what's happening?
[00:40.00]How are you?
[00:43.42]Welcome to another stream.
[00:49.09]I just read this as, hey, what level in WoW?
[00:53.67]But they said you went live now.
[00:57.44]Level 20.
[00:58.14]I haven't played WoW in a long time.
[01:08.14]I also just had a coughing fit before the stream turned on.
[01:13.67]I took a sip of coffee and I don't know what it is sometimes, man.
[01:16.89]I don't get it.
[01:18.47]But like I'll take a sip of a hot drink and this is not every time I do this, but do you guys ever have this happen?
[01:23.94]You take a sip of a hot drink and all of a sudden it's just like like it just literally attacks every your nervous system and shit.
[01:32.42]I went down the wrong pipe somehow.
[01:34.00]I don't even I just took a sip normally.
[01:35.66]What the fuck is this?
[01:38.23]uh but let's get the pre-roll ads out and I will be back speaking of coffee I'm gonna go get it filled again and I'm gonna torture myself again it's decaf uh starting soon in a few minutes
[04:52.96]Alright.
[04:54.65]I've sat back down at about 40 or 50 seconds left of this ad start.
[05:01.38]And hey, when it's over, we're going to stay with it because we're going to watch a fuckload of ads.
[05:10.31]What brand of coffee do I drink?
[05:11.55]It depends.
[05:15.63]I like Pete's Coffee.
[05:17.74]I'm a Pete's Coffee kind of guy.
[05:25.48]It doesn't depend, liar.
[05:26.82]I just gave you the brand.
[05:28.25]Do you see or hear what happened to me?
[05:34.84]If I'm going, if I'm getting coffee, I usually drink coffee black.
[05:38.86]I'd say it's pretty rare.
[05:44.17]It's like a 1 in 20.
[05:49.08]It's like a 1 in 20 chance that I will put anything in coffee.
[05:54.29]If I that's why I said depends if I go out and get coffee, I'm not going to drink it black.
[05:59.13]I'm going to get something goofy.
[06:02.22]But just at home.
[06:04.00]It's just Pete's coffee black.
[06:06.98]Medium roast.
[06:14.57]Is your decaf Swiss processed?
[06:17.11]Yes, I believe so.
[06:20.49]Hello, I don't know.
[06:21.85]That's what that's the one you want, right?
[06:24.61]Especially with an instant coffee.
[06:28.18]Because I do my decaf instant coffee.
[06:31.16]And I kind of love it.
[06:32.08]I kind of love instant coffee.
[06:34.06]Is that bad?
[06:36.65]Listen to this.
[06:41.67]Yeah, if it's done with water, instant coffee and decaf is good, right?
[06:46.64]Decaf can have like a chemical process, but as long as it's done with the water process, it's chemical free.
[06:59.00]Why would it be bad?
[07:00.19]Because some processes, I think, use certain, I don't know, ways to remove the caffeine that's not simply with water.
[07:10.58]It's kind of funny.
[07:11.12]I always thought, let's go back to here.
[07:15.55]Go ahead and show you the screen.
[07:17.13]Oh, I just leaked it.
[07:18.53]We're going to be watching the microcrisp of Cathy Mitchell.
[07:22.12]First one is the microcrisp.
[07:25.57]um I hey how are you good morning by the way how are you good morning I always thought that decaf not decaf I thought instant coffee was crazy and awful like how do they get it that way they must pump it full of all kinds of up stuff to get it to be like that for it to be instant coffee it must be full of like awful things that you were reading the back of the box
[07:49.58]I've come to be completely and totally informed of this now.
[07:53.05]Instant coffee is just freeze-dried coffee.
[07:56.24]That's it.
[07:58.08]That's it.
[07:58.46]There's nothing else.
[07:59.02]They don't do anything else to it.
[08:00.43]It's so simple.
[08:03.31]When are you going to get a haircut?
[08:05.44]On your birthday in 10 years.
[08:08.06]It's the simplest process ever.
[08:10.58]I have the two extremes of coffee making.
[08:15.23]Okay?
[08:16.61]I have a great coffee maker.
[08:18.29]I have an amazing coffee maker.
[08:19.85]It takes the beans.
[08:21.24]It grinds them.
[08:22.34]It makes the coffee.
[08:23.40]You can program it.
[08:24.64]The thing is incredible.
[08:25.74]It's an amazing machine.
[08:26.60]I've had it for like five years.
[08:28.58]And then I also have the instant coffee that I just use when I feel like it.
[08:34.69]That's what my dad said 20 years ago.
[08:42.38]Shave your bum beard.
[08:44.02]I'm not shaving this.
[08:45.08]I told you.
[08:45.54]It's a joke for me.
[08:47.12]Sometimes it's not all about what joke is for you.
[08:50.15]This is a bit that I'm doing.
[08:52.69]I told you this last week.
[08:53.91]I don't give a shit how bad it looks.
[08:55.31]It's going to keep going until I don't give a fuck anymore, okay?
[09:01.48]Keep it.
[09:02.78]I listened to the one guy that said keep it.
[09:08.92]This is for me to look into the mirror and go, what the fuck?
[09:14.95]Hey, hey, hey.
[09:18.44]Hey, guy with a beard.
[09:20.60]Hmm, yeah, four score and seven years, right?
[09:22.68]This is for me to do.
[09:23.50]This is not for you.
[09:24.88]Not everything has to be for you, what I do, okay?
[09:35.46]Let's have a little bit of coffee.
[09:41.85]Shavit, you look cooler.
[09:43.41]My goal is to not look cool, guys.
[09:45.65]I think the time for me to look cool, I think my 40th birthday is coming up.
[09:55.60]I don't think I need to carry around a skateboard and say, hey guys, look at how cool I look with my, like, I got a backwards cap on and I've got sunglasses on and I'm outside and I've got like a, I don't need to do that.
[10:09.04]You know, fellow kids, that's what I'm describing.
[10:11.80]I don't care about how cool I look.
[10:17.63]This is when I leave the house with a pair of sandals on, Jean shorts, a button-up, and a one-size-too-big baseball hat for a team I do not know.
[10:31.13]Okay?
[10:33.25]So give it a rest.
[10:40.02]Alright, let's go.
[10:44.79]You look like a lumberjack.
[10:47.34]I thought that person just said, shave your armpits.
[10:49.26]It's like, what do you, how do you, what do you know about that?
[10:58.13]Alright.
[10:58.37]This is the, I do apologize.
[10:59.93]Some of these commercials from like the 80s are going to have crust on them.
[11:03.88]Like a ton of crust.
[11:08.51]So I apologize for the buzzing sound that's going to be in both of your ears.
[11:15.00]But let's see if it's worth it.
[11:16.42]This is the micro crisp with Cathy Mitchell.
[11:20.14]Cathy Mitchell is a celebrity around here.
[11:21.41]If you don't like Cathy Mitchell, if you're new to the channel, which I don't know how you would be, but maybe you are, Cathy Mitchell is required reading.
[11:30.46]It's all the Ernest movies and all the Cathy Mitchell infomercials.
[11:34.16]That's two pieces of the syllabus.
[11:37.18]So if you don't like what we're about to do, I'm sorry, you failed the class.
[11:42.05]Well, you didn't fail it, but that sounded like probably a letter grade you're going to lose.
[11:47.74]right here we go and I I know I'm known as the pause uh pause guy I'm gonna try to not pause I will only pause when I feel it's necessary to make a point which might be like every 10 seconds alright let's go no pausing here we go presentation for micro crisp
[12:12.71]The microwave oven.
[12:14.07]One of the greatest cooking inventions to ever come along.
[12:16.84]Except for one thing.
[12:18.34]You get pale, rubbery chicken, cardboardy pizza, and hard, inedible breads and pastries.
[12:24.44]Wouldn't it be great if your microwave oven could bake pastry that came out like this?
[12:28.49]Crisp and flakey.
[12:30.43]cook chicken from frozen to a juicy golden brown or cook barbecue ribs looking like they just came off the grill well now you okay all these dishes and more can be made in your microwave oven thanks wait wait wait wait wait wait I'm pausing because I'm seeing a lot of over here right now people saying just get an air fryer air fryer there needs a lot there needs to be context on this video
[12:50.58]This is from 1989 or so.
[12:54.69]This is like from the 80s or the early 90s.
[12:57.59]They didn't have air fryers.
[13:00.12]All you guys are time traveling back to talk shit about this.
[13:03.28]And this shit didn't exist.
[13:07.89]It's over like 30 years of food technology.
[13:11.10]What I will say is...
[13:14.14]I microwaving anything, I think potentially in the next hundred years, I think that like, it's going to come out potentially that like, I've talked about this and I'm, I'm going to be wrong.
[13:25.03]And that's fine.
[13:25.73]I will be completely wrong or completely right.
[13:28.15]And whatever, like, I'm just talking right now.
[13:31.03]But if there's one appliance in the world that I really think is like a weird appliance that everybody uses, I use it all the time.
[13:36.56]I use it all the fucking time.
[13:38.71]There's a box in your house that sends radio waves into your food.
[13:42.43]Do you know what I mean?
[13:42.99]Like, oh, microwaves, not radio waves, right?
[13:44.82]I'm not going to be a liar.
[13:47.48]I feel like in like 200 years, if the aliens find us, they're going to be like, you guys are shooting waves through your food?
[13:54.07]What's the, the radiation is going into your food?
[13:56.43]What are you talking about?
[13:58.38]Yeah, it's the microwave.
[13:59.58]Look, you get an easy meals in three minutes.
[14:04.17]Oh, shit.
[14:04.83]They don't know.
[14:06.53]Well, actually, what that's doing, that's doing DNA damage to every fucking cell in your body.
[14:10.36]I don't know.
[14:10.84]Who knows?
[14:11.66]It's not, I know it's not radiation.
[14:13.16]I'm just saying, like, I'm just talking.
[14:16.49]I think microwaving anything for more than four or five minutes scares me.
[14:21.07]One minute reheat is fine to me.
[14:22.67]But when things, if you look at the back of the box of some shit, it's like, oh, microwave for what, five plus minutes.
[14:28.34]It's like, it feels like a long time to have it in there.
[14:33.13]with three patents licensed from one of America's largest food companies today on cook's kitchen the original the extraordinary new cooking product microcrisp the microcrisp now here's your host John cook John cook is in this take a look at this John turnover is a great treat if you that's a great name to have now this one took 25 minutes to bake wow it's the John cook how would you like to be able to bake a turnover like this straight from the freezer
[15:01.07]in just four minutes and do it in your microwave.
[15:03.70]John, that's impossible.
[15:04.50]Well, my guest on the program today has a simple, inexpensive product that she says can do exactly that.
[15:10.00]Bake brown and crisp in the microwave.
[15:12.50]John Cook.
[15:13.65]I love this guy.
[15:16.05]So let's welcome a familiar face.
[15:17.67]Someone you've seen many times demonstrating new products on television.
[15:21.01]I know I'm pausing, but that's true.
[15:23.00]How many microwaves do you need in the house?
[15:24.84]I know this is for demonstration purposes, but if I walk into your house and you get three microwaves on your counter, I'm going to be like, what's going on in here?
[15:33.88]Do you need three microwaves?
[15:36.84]Is this like a college dorm?
[15:41.45]Here's Cathy Mitchell.
[15:42.89]Hi, John.
[15:43.51]Hi, Kathy.
[15:44.15]What is this amazing new product that you tell us will bake brown and crisp in the microwave?
[15:48.76]Well, you just said it.
[15:50.14]Micro crisp.
[15:51.12]You know, this is an incredible new product for your microwave with three patents from one of the largest food companies in America.
[15:58.85]Why don't they want to be named?
[16:00.17]Don't don't name us don't name us you could use it, but don't I don't want you to tell you don't tell them it was me The idea is that by placing the pizza on that disk it eliminates that soggy microwave crust Good idea exactly, but it kind of doesn't but it's a little bit expensive now
[16:17.95]Micro crisp is available on a roll like this.
[16:20.88]And I'm going to show you how it'll change the way you think about cooking in your microwave.
[16:25.70]Now take that apple turnover.
[16:27.24]You probably read the warning on the box that said don't even think about putting this in the microwave.
[16:31.73]Don't even think about it.
[16:32.31]Well, I'm conducting a little experiment to show you how well micro crisp works.
[16:36.25]This is a specially coated paper that actually converts microwaves into thermal energy, like inside a regular oven.
[16:42.76]So when you wrap it around the food, it becomes a mini oven in your microwave.
[16:48.26]I don't know what that was showing us, but it did not look good.
[16:51.09]That looked like a fucking turd.
[16:52.41]What was that?
[16:53.59]It's actually going to build a little miniature oven around that turnover, so now it's going to bake inside my microwave.
[17:00.46]Great idea.
[17:00.94]Now, I'm conducting a special experiment right now.
[17:03.40]Before you came in, I put two identical turnovers in these two identical microwaves, one wrapped in micro-crisp and one without.
[17:11.17]And in a minute, I think we're going to show you how they look.
[17:13.37]Now, this special rack is very important.
[17:15.45]It comes with your micro-crisp.
[17:16.92]comes with a little dish rack the food so that it cooks real evenly now these should be just about ready there's the bell why don't you go ahead and get that oh my god that's so many microwaves I don't know if I this is too many microwaves that's five at least five or six microwaves in this house I feel like this is like in Gordon Ramsay kitchen nightmare episodes when he goes in the back and it's like oh dear no no you got six microwaves back here
[17:45.37]It's a Gordon Ramsay microwave disaster set.
[17:49.32]Let me see this.
[17:50.85]Oh, that's hot.
[17:51.65]Huh?
[17:52.01]Look at that.
[17:53.01]What do you think?
[17:53.88]Well, it looks just like the one that came out of the conventional oven.
[17:57.53]Okay, well, which one tastes better, Kathy?
[17:59.64]In just four minutes.
[18:01.14]No preheating, quite a time saver.
[18:03.37]I think you'll agree.
[18:04.27]Oh, that's amazing.
[18:05.05]That's great.
[18:05.85]Well, you know, microcrisp is going to change the way you feel about a lot of things you don't already cook in your microwave.
[18:12.07]And I want to show you one of the most obvious ones.
[18:14.57]How about meat?
[18:15.47]Here's a chicken breast.
[18:16.92]Frozen solid.
[18:18.16]Probably the last thing a hungry person wants to face when he comes home from work.
[18:21.32]And one of the best reasons for going out for fast food.
[18:23.69]I forgot to defrost.
[18:24.71]Exactly right.
[18:26.29]John Cook forgot to defrost.
[18:28.18]The cook.
[18:28.80]You can use whatever you like.
[18:31.12]Wait, is it raw?
[18:31.85]I'm going to go ahead and just wrap it up in this micro crisp.
[18:34.79]Mm-hmm.
[18:35.91]Now, all I'm going to do is place it on that rack and right into this microwave.
[18:40.31]And if you can believe it, six minutes.
[18:42.96]Oh, Kathy.
[18:43.58]The most perfectly brown, moist, tender chicken you've ever seen.
[18:47.39]So we've got some chicken cooking, Kathy.
[18:48.95]But what about other meat?
[18:49.83]Well, I've cooked just about every meat there is in the microwave.
[18:52.61]And I put all the times and techniques in my cookbook that comes along with your microwave.
[18:57.16]Look at this book.
[18:57.68]This book is a treasure.
[18:58.66]It's a national treasure to have that if you have it.
[19:00.85]stackable cooking.
[19:02.11]This is a way to let you put an entire meal in the microwave and cook it all at the same time.
[19:06.67]Come on down here.
[19:07.28]I have one just about ready to show you.
[19:09.02]Now, what I've got here is just a standard casserole.
[19:10.88]There were seven beeps.
[19:12.10]It's fake.
[19:12.68]And I've got in here the ingredients for one of the cookbook recipes for a vegetable and almonds.
[19:16.99]Now, that was edited.
[19:18.59]Did you hear that?
[19:19.65]Hold on.
[19:20.43]Let me turn it up a little.
[19:23.67]I'm going back a little.
[19:25.19]It was like, blah, blah, blah, and almonds.
[19:29.60]Come on down here, I have one just about ready to show you.
[19:32.89]Now what I've got here is just a standard casserole.
[19:34.89]Everybody's got one in their kitchen.
[19:36.55]And I've got in here the ingredients for one of the cookbook recipes for a vegetable and almonds.
[19:40.86]Now, here I've got some pork chops that I've been marinating in some teriyaki glaze.
[19:46.62]I'm going to show you how we're going to cook those pork chops right along with this rice at the same time so you can put a meal on the table without messing up the stove or heating up the oven or anything.
[19:54.37]This we've got to see.
[19:55.49]Alright, I'm going to go ahead and put our pork chops right there on the rack.
[19:58.65]Those look good.
[19:59.46]And we're going to microwave pork chop.
[20:01.30]Microwave pork chop does not sound good.
[20:03.40]Normally, I'd barbecue these or maybe put them in the oven, but that would take almost an hour in the oven.
[20:09.47]They're going to cook in the microwave in about 15 to 20 minutes.
[20:15.57]20 minutes in the microwave?
[20:17.74]20 minutes in the microwave?
[20:20.38]I don't want to eat that.
[20:21.20]That's probably fucked up.
[20:22.96]20 minutes in the microwave.
[20:25.68]I'm just going to take a little piece of tape just to help hold that closed.
[20:29.09]That's unbelievable.
[20:29.81]Now, this dish is going to become the lid to our casserole, so that rice is going to steam in there.
[20:33.96]And if you want to grab that, we'll get it in here.
[20:36.50]Now, normally it would take 15 to 20 minutes.
[20:38.30]I'm going to give this one about 20 because those chops are pretty thick.
[20:42.23]Dude, it's going for too long.
[20:43.53]Exactly.
[20:44.11]But I figured, you know, you might be hungry now.
[20:45.49]Can a microwave even be on for 20 minutes?
[20:47.21]I don't know.
[20:47.59]A little bird told me, too, that you were a big fan of barbecued ribs.
[20:51.50]No, no.
[20:51.96]Kathy, you're not going to tell me you've been barbecuing in the microwave.
[20:54.69]Well, I'm going to let you be the judge of that.
[20:56.83]I don't think I've ever done that.
[20:58.19]Yeah.
[20:58.45]set that right down here now these were in for 20 minutes probably couldn't even get your charcoal heated up in 20 minutes I want you to take are you ready take a look at this look at that oh wait a minute if you could smell these you would know that they smell wonderful they are indeed barbecue they came out of the microwave oh don't they look alright how afraid is this guy you know the thing I love
[21:20.08]He's right now just being like, oh, fuck, what did I agree to do this?
[21:23.77]Shit, I have to take a bite out of all this 30-minute microwave food.
[21:27.11]Okay, John, you're John Cook.
[21:29.52]You are the John Cook.
[21:30.70]You invented food.
[21:31.92]You can do it.
[21:32.92]I can just throw that away.
[21:34.36]We've got a disposable oven in our oven.
[21:35.95]Right.
[21:36.09]Now take a look at these potatoes.
[21:37.75]Those cooked at the same time.
[21:39.13]These are an herbed potato.
[21:41.51]And that recipe, again, is right in the cookbook.
[21:43.78]Nice and juicy.
[21:44.38]Those look good.
[21:45.57]Wonderful.
[21:46.39]I bet you can find something to do with those.
[21:48.13]I have some friends out there behind the cameras that I think I'm going to have sample these with me and put it to the test.
[21:53.14]Okay.
[21:53.75]Really cooked meat in a microwave.
[21:55.43]Alright.
[21:56.87]Now let's have a little fun.
[21:58.16]Hold on a second.
[21:59.28]He said you've got to take a bite.
[22:00.80]They always take a bite.
[22:02.27]They take a bite every time.
[22:04.73]Oh, this looks good.
[22:07.17]All it didn't show is him putting it down under the table for the dog to eat it.
[22:10.90]You know what I mean?
[22:11.38]Like, oh, yeah.
[22:12.08]Oh, delicious.
[22:13.40]Go find it.
[22:15.02]This is between you and me.
[22:16.06]I can't fucking believe he just walked off camera and didn't even take a bite.
[22:20.47]Every food infomercial I've ever seen in my whole life, that co-host takes a bite and goes, ooh, you know, Kathy, it's tender.
[22:28.02]That's unbelievable.
[22:28.76]I have a family of snackers.
[22:30.31]And since those guys would never dream of cooking a meal, we'll use the microwave for snacks.
[22:35.16]I try to keep things on hand for them to fix.
[22:37.46]Plus, now we can use a lot of things that never before could go in the microwave.
[22:41.59]Like these refrigerated doughs.
[22:43.63]You know, my kids have always loved hot dogs wrapped in these crescent rolls.
[22:47.28]I love hot dogs.
[22:48.22]There we go.
[22:49.08]But you know, that took about 20 minutes in a 375-degree oven, and I don't like the kids using the oven when I'm not around.
[22:56.71]Now, with Micro Crisp, they can make these for themselves anytime, and this is a favorite treat for my teenagers.
[23:02.72]Now, all I'm going to do is separate this dough and go ahead and wrap that hot dog right in it, just like that.
[23:11.38]This actually would probably be pretty great.
[23:13.65]Now, there are a couple of hints that'll make this a lot easier for you to use.
[23:17.64]First of all, anytime I'm working with the raw dough, I find a little spray of Pam or any nonstick spray will help the dough not to stick to the micro crisp.
[23:26.17]So if you'd normally spray a pan for oven baking, you're going to spray the micro crisp for microwave baking.
[23:32.38]I don't know why.
[23:33.58]I sound like a bird flying to that window.
[23:36.21]I don't know why.
[23:37.87]And we're just going to wrap those right up in the microcrisp.
[23:41.09]Now, here's a little trick my kids discovered.
[23:43.18]A little piece of tape helps to hold that microcrisp closed around the food.
[23:47.34]A piece of... Can you put tape in the microwave?
[23:48.60]Now, we'll just wrap that up and tape it.
[23:52.75]And on the rack and into the microwave, two minutes.
[23:57.14]Now, you know, these would take about 20 minutes in a 400-degree oven.
[24:01.58]But they're going to bake in that microwave in just two minutes.
[24:04.67]I could cook a hot dog in probably...
[24:07.03]Now, I'm going to show you a great fruit snack idea.
[24:10.26]This is going to be some of the easiest apple pie type snack you ever saw.
[24:15.03]And we're just going to give it a little shake.
[24:17.65]Now, there's the filling.
[24:21.04]Now, for the crust, I'm just going to go ahead and use this crescent roll here.
[24:24.75]The kitchen scissors work great for this.
[24:27.70]My family knows under penalty of death, nobody touches mom's kitchen scissors for anything.
[24:33.31]Alright.
[24:34.31]Now all I have to do is take an apple.
[24:36.29]She's going to kill them.
[24:36.91]Wrap it right up in that dough.
[24:39.88]And then we'll wrap it in some micro crisps and we'll have like little individual apple pies that are going to bake up in about two minutes.
[24:47.27]Now you don't have to wrap everything individually.
[24:49.79]That actually might be good too.
[24:51.41]Put a little bit of ice cream with that.
[24:52.93]She's going to.
[24:53.65]What I'm going to do is take one sheet of micro crisps, spray it.
[24:57.25]And just lay these right across the center like this.
[24:59.86]Where's John Cook?
[25:00.74]He's alright.
[25:01.51]All I have to do is wrap them up.
[25:02.81]He's eating with the crew right now.
[25:06.11]And those are going to bake in the microwave for just two minutes.
[25:10.43]Oh, wow, this is great.
[25:11.95]I'll be back later.
[25:13.20]I'm going to go share this with other people.
[25:15.60]Oh, that was amazing.
[25:17.44]Okay, Kathy, the crew wants to know what's next.
[25:20.20]They made short work of those ribs.
[25:22.12]Look at that.
[25:22.40]Well, it didn't leave you much, did they?
[25:23.59]Well, I've just put those snacks in the microwave, and they're just going to take about two minutes.
[25:28.03]They ate those fast, dude.
[25:29.25]Why don't we take a look at that chicken we cooked earlier?
[25:31.87]Hold on, dude.
[25:32.51]Hold on a second.
[25:34.12]Okay.
[25:35.96]He's, I love this.
[25:38.40]The infomercial is an art that is gone and it's sad that it is because what we're led to believe is that John Cook hooked that back to feed the crew who is currently working on this show.
[25:51.24]They're currently working on this show and they're about to eat barbecue ribs and then touch a bunch of camera equipment while they're filming it and doing the gone, you know, production stuff.
[26:02.30]I hope there was a lot of napkins back there, John.
[26:05.68]Because if you're going to get a bunch of people barbecue ribs, you better be ready for it.
[26:11.14]Because that's a mess.
[26:13.41]What if they're hungry?
[26:14.77]I'm just saying, like, it's been three and a half minutes.
[26:19.87]Okay, did he just set that out like it was a bait or something?
[26:25.80]Like, oh, hey, guys, here, crew, here you go.
[26:27.76]And put it down and ten people just swarmed it like a pack of piranhas in two and a half minutes and it's just gone?
[26:37.45]It fed everyone.
[26:39.38]Did everybody get a half of a rib?
[26:42.03]He had a plate with like six ribs on it.
[26:44.67]The whole crew is like 40 people.
[26:46.36]Everyone got to take one bite.
[26:51.51]Keep her out of me.
[26:52.39]I tell you what, no more rubber chicken.
[26:55.41]I know better than that.
[26:56.54]Remember this one?
[26:58.00]Take a look at that.
[26:59.14]That is wonderful.
[27:00.70]Did you ever believe that chicken could come out of a microwave looking like that?
[27:03.96]Oh, let me take a bite out of that, Gabby.
[27:05.26]You think we should maybe just taste that?
[27:07.73]Wait, wait, he's going to taste it.
[27:10.45]Why don't you see how moist and juicy that is?
[27:13.71]Are you ready for this?
[27:14.54]Watch out, it's hot.
[27:17.80]no more rubber chicken never again in the microwave I know it's great isn't it
[27:22.68]but not just chicken and not just pork I have a real challenge for you here I'll bet the last thing anybody think about putting in a microwave was beef oh you're not going to cook beef oh yes I am I've got some shish kebabs here you know my family loves shish kebabs because they're fast and fun they don't make them like they used to they just don't make I don't give a fuck what anybody says they just don't make them like they used to Keith likes cherry tomatoes and green peppers I like just mushrooms and onions now watch how easy this is all I'm going to do is take a micro crisp
[27:52.16]And wrap these guys up.
[27:53.80]Now, I have kind of a special way that I discovered to cook these.
[27:57.27]I like to cook them upright.
[27:59.39]They seem to would let the fat drain away a little bit more.
[28:01.91]It's a lot healthier.
[28:02.98]So watch this.
[28:05.00]I take a little potato and just lay it in the plate and just stick those guys in there.
[28:10.67]What?
[28:11.53]That's cute.
[28:12.99]I'm sorry.
[28:14.17]They cook much evener and it comes out just great.
[28:17.74]And by the way, I don't waste anything.
[28:20.13]That potato, chop it up, make some hash browns tomorrow morning, dynamite.
[28:24.56]Cathy Mitchell was very much about not wasting any food.
[28:27.91]She was about that big time.
[28:29.49]For 15 minutes.
[28:30.70]Mm-hmm.
[28:33.64]well we'll see about cooking beef in the microwave okay okay I don't know hear me out on this though hear me out on this they got seven microwaves going at the same time they're talking about why what do you think about dessert kathy I heard can you even do dessert and while they're talking when all the both of them their hair starts to stand up a little just a little just enough where it's like whoa something's going on in that room
[29:00.08]And eventually there is like when you're taught, you remember that science experiment we did in school where everybody's like, oh, touch the, the, the, the science teacher has the electric static thing and look, oh, like Timmy's hair is standing up.
[29:11.76]That's crazy.
[29:13.14]Like that.
[29:14.90]So ready.
[29:15.24]You want to grab that one right there?
[29:17.40]These are our surprise snacks.
[29:19.79]Mystery snacks.
[29:20.93]That's right.
[29:21.39]Mystery snacks.
[29:21.93]Well, this one smells like an apple mystery.
[29:24.00]Oh, gosh.
[29:24.78]Oh, he doesn't know.
[29:25.44]That's right.
[29:25.86]I forgot he doesn't know.
[29:26.72]Why am I looking at you?
[29:27.44]Don't look at me.
[29:27.94]Alright.
[29:28.26]Well, let me show you this one first.
[29:30.58]This is what my kids call Dippity Dogs.
[29:33.13]Now, it's kind of a dumb name.
[29:34.29]Those are little hot dogs.
[29:35.73]Right.
[29:36.39]And then these are the apple mystery.
[29:38.13]Apple mystery.
[29:39.07]Oh, a little hot dog.
[29:40.43]Kathy, are these safety?
[29:41.90]Is this 170 degrees internal temperature or whatever the hell it needs to be?
[29:45.12]You ever been to the county fair?
[29:46.52]Sure.
[29:46.90]I think this is one they haven't discovered yet.
[29:48.56]Hot apple pie.
[29:49.64]Skibidi dogs.
[29:50.55]I love it.
[29:51.53]Little apple pie.
[29:52.59]Oh, and they are great, too.
[29:53.85]Go ahead and try one.
[29:54.77]I know you're dying to taste it.
[29:55.99]I'm going to try one.
[29:56.63]The crew's going to try one.
[29:57.57]In fact, this would be a great time right now.
[29:59.31]If I can, Kathy, we'll take a commercial break and tell everybody watching how they can get their own micro crisp.
[30:03.98]And while we're doing that, we can sample our mystery treats.
[30:07.08]And then when we come back, we'll find out if Kathy can really cook beef in the microwave.
[30:12.22]What if I told you that this right here was cooked in a microwave?
[30:14.74]It's a hidden camera?
[30:19.63]I wouldn't believe it.
[30:20.09]This is delicious.
[30:21.53]What if I told you this was cooked in a microwave oven?
[30:25.00]Dude, if you are filming on this set, are you kidding me?
[30:29.08]Getting that footage?
[30:30.61]They all high-fived behind this camera.
[30:33.23]The producer, the director, the cinematographer, the screenwriter, all of them just went, fucking yes, did you see that, man?
[30:40.34]Oh my God, that's the one.
[30:42.12]Oh my god, they all collectively had a fucking freakout.
[30:46.87]It's pigs in a blanket.
[30:49.93]Yeah, but done in the micro crisp.
[30:55.08]Oh no.
[30:56.22]What if I told you that these were cooked in a microwave oven?
[30:59.10]That would be very nice.
[31:00.79]You could teach me how to do it.
[31:02.85]What surprises me is the browning.
[31:05.46]and um even the texture of the crust that it would come out that flakey it's like you cooked it in an oven what if I told you this was cooked in a microwave oven that's great get ready to rediscover your microwave with a new don't put the whole thing like this in there though that would be dangerous folks don't put the boxes microwave cooking is here at last because microcrisp makes it possible to use your microwave to cook foods with the look and taste of coming from mom's oven
[31:34.54]Oh, we wrote that line.
[31:36.76]That's a good one, too.
[31:40.71]They kind of popped that, like, zip.
[31:52.05]I'm sorry, I just ruined the baked potato for, like, half of you here.
[31:57.06]That looks good.
[32:00.83]What the fuck?
[32:01.55]Why'd you say that?
[32:02.29]Because that's what it looked like to me, and this is my stream.
[32:04.97]That's right.
[32:05.69]Microwaved meat, brown just like from the oven.
[32:08.74]And delicious sandwiches brought back to life in two minutes with bread that stays soft.
[32:13.60]This, I think, would be actually a pretty good use for this.
[32:16.12]Reheating sandwiches.
[32:17.70]Reheating food like... Maybe it actually does have some technology in it that works that way.
[32:22.79]Zombie sandwich?
[32:24.65]Don't act like you're above that.
[32:27.45]A lot of people in this chat right now, I think...
[32:29.95]like they're above reheating a sandwich or something come on you're not above that we've all done it I'm not I haven't done that I okay you won you won uh the the food war I guess here I don't know I've microwaved what did you say
[32:58.32]Mr. I'm not a pause Andy has been live for over twice the video's watch time.
[33:03.67]That's a, that's a, that's a misinformation statement.
[33:07.33]Uh, I've been live, yes, I've been technically live for twice the length of this video.
[33:11.88]But, I didn't start watching this video until at least five, ten minutes into this live stream.
[33:18.29]So, you need to get that facts straightened out for you.
[33:22.27]Thanks to Micro Crisp.
[33:24.02]plus micro crisp does what no other product has been able to do you can now cook baked products like apple turnovers crescent rolls and other delicious snacks right in your microwave don't be confused by other microwave wraps micro crisp in the purple box bakes browns and crisps developed in the mid 80s thanks to a scientific purple box now that was like a competitor into thermal energy creating a mini oven all around your food
[33:51.46]Manufactured and sold under license from one of America's largest food companies, it's proven safe and super convenient.
[34:00.80]They keep saying that.

[34:24.30]And the cookbook, Cooking with Kathy, the Micro Crisp Way.
[34:27.84]In it, Kathy shares simple, easy-to-follow instructions.
[34:30.18]That looks like an AI-generated photo.
[34:39.35]Doesn't this look AI-generated?
[34:42.52]The placement of the plates, the fact that the micro... Oh, no, no, no, no.
[34:46.12]You can tell this is AI-generated.
[34:47.42]You know how I can tell?
[34:48.68]Because there would never be a microwave on a cutting board like this.
[34:52.36]And the fact that the plates are all... Look at the plates stacked on top of each other.
[34:55.09]They don't work.
[34:55.71]Look at... This thing got it wrong.
[34:57.33]This is falling off the table here.
[34:59.23]It's three of them on top?
[35:01.31]Why would there not just be one?
[35:03.46]Yeah, you can tell that this is put through AI.
[35:05.40]You can just tell.

[36:05.05]Amazon Prime two-day delivery.
[36:07.43]We used to have to wait like two months to get shit in the fucking mail.
[36:12.97]I remember buying stuff from infomercials that I've seen before, and it was a joy if it came in like three and a half weeks.
[36:21.83]Two rolls of micro crisp, the useful resin tray, and Kathy's cookbook filled with hundreds of microwave time-saving recipes and tips, all for just $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
[36:32.96]You told us this about Larry Anderson's jaw droppers?
[36:34.97]What's one of the best purchases?
[36:36.51]That's one of the best purchases I've ever made was Larry Anderson's jaw droppers.
[36:42.07]I wouldn't have cared about doing entertainment or I wouldn't have really cared if it wasn't for Larry Anderson's jaw droppers.
[36:51.24]I was like 13.
[36:51.96]I was like 12.
[36:54.19]And I saw the magic tricks that he was doing.
[36:56.19]I was like, I have to fuck him.
[36:57.39]I need this.
[37:00.52]It was a magic tutorial VHS set.
[37:04.85]Oh man, was it great.
[37:08.92]Maybe one day we'll try to, I think they're on, I think you can watch them on YouTube.

[37:27.03]That sounds fun.
[37:27.70]Skagway Avenue, Toronto.
[37:29.96]I'll write it down.
[37:30.60]3 V1.
[37:31.76]Pick up your phone and I just wrote it to hard drive.
[37:34.72]We're back on Cook's Kitchen, everybody, here with Cathy Mitchell, demonstrating the amazing Micro Crisp, which allows you to bake, to brown, and to crisp, and even cook, as you can see right here, cook meat in your microwave oven, something you could not do without Micro Crisp.
[37:48.53]Now, these shish kebabs came out absolutely gorgeous, Kathy.
[37:51.58]Pretty incredible, isn't it?
[37:52.26]Yeah, I'm going to put them to the test, though.
[37:53.54]I'm going to take them out and feed them to our crew and see what they think.
[37:56.10]I thought you might.
[37:56.76]Our crew claims, Kathy, that they have not even had time to prepare breakfast today.
[38:00.81]Well, breakfast probably is the most hectic time to try to get a meal on the table.
[38:05.28]And I've already shown you a few examples of the stackable recipes you'll find in the cookbook.
[38:09.69]Let me show you a great breakfast idea.
[38:12.01]This is a fast, easy way to cook eggs, sausage, and biscuits all at the same time.
[38:17.11]But it is a little sauce that he just keeps walking away with it.
[38:20.59]Eggs are easy to cook in the microwave if you know a few tricks.
[38:24.52]I'm going to use this casserole dish, and I'm going to make what my family calls a scrambled omelet.
[38:29.06]So I've beaten three eggs with a little seasoning.
[38:31.23]Now, since eggs cook faster at the edge of the pan than in the middle, use a small glass bowl like this upside down.
[38:37.70]Now there's no middle to worry about.
[38:39.62]All these instructions are in the cookbook.
[38:41.44]She did have a lot of cool little tips.
[38:43.30]Alright, I'm pausing one more time.
[38:46.01]Cathy Mitchell had, and I'm going to piss off a lot of the younger generation here.
[38:50.77]Sorry.
[38:52.17]Cathy Mitchell was like the TikTok food hacks before TikTok.
[38:57.56]She had all kinds of cool little things, little tricks that she was doing before TikTok.
[39:04.09]So I may have angered a little bit of some of you here.
[39:09.18]I'm sorry about that.
[39:11.49]No, that's true.
[39:12.13]Yeah, I know it is.
[39:15.27]Grr, grr, don't do that.
[39:18.12]This actually might be pretty good.
[39:28.51]Why do you need a micro-crisp for this?
[39:37.92]Now, for the sausage and biscuits.
[39:40.02]Oh, like a dentist is just drilling into my molar.
[39:42.61]And they bake up nice and brown in micro-crisp.
[39:47.05]Now, if there was meat in the omelet, I could just bake the biscuits on the top rack.
[39:51.02]But today, I'm wrapping a brown and served sausage in one of those biscuits to make little pigs in a blanket.
[39:56.05]Now, to save time, I went ahead and did the first three.
[39:58.15]And now, I'll just go ahead and do the last one here.
[40:00.39]Just wrap the biscuit around the sausage and then roll it in your micro-crisp.
[40:04.90]Now, this whole thing is going to cook in just seven minutes.
[40:11.67]In we go.
[40:12.09]Do you think it's going to work?
[40:13.32]And seven minutes.
[40:16.97]And I don't even have to babysit those eggs, so now I have time to get myself ready.
[40:21.07]Yeah, they even tell me you can do a whole 16-pound turkey in the microwave.
[40:23.90]But with micro-crisp, there's always time for everybody's favorite cinnamon rolls.
[40:27.06]Just wrap it in the micro-crisp.
[40:27.90]And all you have to worry about is an hour and 45 minutes instead of six hours.
[40:32.69]But with micro-crisp, they only take a few minutes.
[40:35.15]Now, I'm just going to go ahead and cook four of them today, and I'll save the rest of these for tomorrow.
[40:40.71]Now, all we have to do is wrap them in a sheet of micro-crisp.
[40:44.63]Now remember, anytime you're using raw dough, need that little spray of Pam.
[40:49.92]And then we'll just lay those cinnamon rolls right out on there.
[40:54.22]Pull up the edges.
[40:55.96]Now you want to leave a little room because these are going to rise.
[40:59.19]And that little piece of tape.
[41:03.03]And those are going to bake in the microwave because of that micro crisp two and a half minutes.
[41:08.16]No more preheating that oven.
[41:13.74]There.
[41:14.82]Now, with breakfast out of the way, let's talk about lunch.
[41:17.71]You know, I've noticed lots of people use the microwave-rated sandwiches for storage later.
[41:21.81]But frankly, they don't turn out all that great.
[41:24.12]But following the package directions and wrapping in micro-crisp instead of a paper towel, the buns are going to stay a whole lot softer, and they're actually going to be quite good.
[41:32.44]But I find those are a little bit expensive, so I made my own reheatable sandwich.
[41:37.14]Now, I started with my favorite, a ham and cheese croissant.
[41:40.42]You know, this wonderful, light, flakey texture can turn tough instantly when heated in the microwave.
[41:45.27]That's one of the best things.
[41:45.99]So, micro-crisp to the rescue.
[41:48.15]And you know, since most offices have a microwave, this is a great way to have a fresh, hot lunch at the office.
[41:54.10]Now, all you do is pack as usual, but wrap in micro-crisp first.
[41:58.66]Now, this is going to heat in about a minute and a half.
[42:01.54]Ham and cheese croissant.
[42:06.67]I used to get that at Dunkin' Donuts like three times a week.
[42:09.37]Like 20, 30 years ago.
[42:22.87]It was so good.
[42:28.71]Well, you see, Kathy, when I brought that over there, they asked me if I could heat this up instead because they didn't want that inedible food that I brought them.
[42:34.81]So could you just put this in the regular microwave?
[42:38.11]They specifically asked me the regular microwave without that shit on it because they would rather eat this.
[42:45.39]sure can you know most delivery services offer a great deal on a second pizza and now you can take advantage of that because leftover pizza wrapped and reheated in micro crisp tastes as good as when it was first delivered maybe a little warmer and that's a real time and money saver I actually think this would work well with a piece of pizza I just happen to have some cinnamon rolls over here
[43:06.75]You know, until I got Micro Crisp, we saved these for a Sunday morning breakfast because they took about 20 minutes in a real hot oven.
[43:13.80]And how long with Micro Crisp?
[43:14.76]This was in for two and a half minutes.
[43:17.28]Take a look at those.
[43:18.30]Oh, those look great.
[43:19.00]No, no, no, no.
[43:20.62]Oh, now he's all excited.
[43:21.92]Why don't you get our sandwich out of the oven over there?
[43:25.55]Get the frosting on these.
[43:27.21]You know, I reheated that sandwich because I wanted you to see how wonderful the bread stays when you wrap it in Micro Crisp.
[43:33.35]It doesn't come out like something that went through nuclear war.
[43:36.62]Yeah, I think this would work pretty well.
[43:39.06]Don't those look great?
[43:39.67]You know, I think they actually come out better in the microcrisp than when you bake them in the oven.
[43:43.30]They're a lot higher and lighter.
[43:45.30]And you couldn't do this without microcrisp, right?
[43:47.41]That's exactly right.
[43:49.27]Okay, now we can take a look at this sandwich.
[43:51.46]Whoa, it's hot, too.
[43:53.02]Alright.
[43:54.14]That's great because you can make those and take them to work.
[43:57.65]Okay, I think this would be great for this exact thing.
[44:01.32]This and the pizza, honestly.
[44:04.08]You remember those pork chops?
[44:05.17]Yes.
[44:06.33]Alright, take a look at these.
[44:08.43]Oh, they smell good.
[44:11.02]Oh, they sure do, don't they?
[44:12.08]They certainly do.
[44:13.32]Alright, now be honest.
[44:15.04]You're the guy who thought your microwave could only reheat coffee and make popcorn.
[44:19.33]Exactly.
[44:19.75]Now I've taken you through breakfast and lunch, and here's dinner.
[44:23.48]Trader Joe's makes some pretty damn good shit in the microwave.
[44:27.00]Complete dinner, right?
[44:27.80]Because don't forget we've got that rice dish right there underneath.
[44:30.37]All of this in the microwave, 20 minutes or less.
[44:33.37]So you're starting to realize that your microwave can be more than a $200 popcorn popper?
[44:37.49]Am I tweaking right now?
[44:38.91]I think it's time for us to check on our breakfast over here.
[44:41.44]You were asking about breakfast, and I want you to see this complete breakfast that I prepared.
[44:46.04]Ooh, that's warm.
[44:46.88]Watch out.
[44:47.96]Oh, look at that.
[44:48.72]Look at that omelet.
[44:49.58]Alright, I've got an omelet.
[44:52.03]Ooh.
[44:52.43]And these are little pigs in a blanket.
[44:54.35]I didn't see you putting those together.
[44:55.85]Yeah, my kids love these dipped in syrup.
[44:57.57]Look how beautiful and brown they come out.
[44:59.41]It's a great quick...
[45:00.86]Busy morning breakfast.
[45:02.68]Oh, that looks absolutely wonderful.
[45:04.38]Well, I'm going to go ahead and get this on plate.
[45:06.58]Hot Pockets stole this idea.
[45:07.39]How did Hot Pockets come out?
[45:09.05]Oh, yes, I knew you would.
[45:10.09]Those look absolutely wonderful.
[45:11.69]Breakfast.
[45:12.29]Hey, all you European.
[45:13.29]In a matter of minutes.
[45:14.49]And included sausages.
[45:16.23]And biscuits, too.
[45:17.58]Now, while Kathy and I sample our microwave breakfast, we're going to tell you how you can get your own micro crisp and make miracles like this in your microwave at home.
[45:25.46]We'll be right back on Cook's Kitchen.
[45:26.88]Stay with us.
[45:28.79]What if I told you this cooked in a microwave oven?
[45:30.96]Oh, very good.
[45:32.19]Yeah, I'm impressed.
[45:34.01]This is real American.
[45:35.31]This is real North American cuisine.
[45:37.15]That's right.
[45:38.14]It's soft, fluffy, and tastes good.
[45:43.51]Sorry, you don't get it.
[45:44.97]It wasn't hard like a rock.
[45:46.97]Europeans don't get it.
[45:48.07]I'm streaming it like an EU-friendly hour, too.
[45:51.60]But you also have the speed of a microwave oven, so you know you're killing two birds with one stone.
[45:56.98]I think that's the end of this one.
[46:00.01]Another minute or two?
[46:07.28]Yeah, okay, we're going to get the finale.
[46:17.71]Coming from Mom's Oven.
[46:22.92]Deliciously fluffy in just seven minutes.
[46:25.90]Kebabs in six minutes.
[46:27.33]That's right.
[46:28.09]Microwaved meat, brown just like from the oven.
[46:30.53]That's right.
[46:31.15]And delicious sandwiches brought back to life in two minutes with bread that stays soft, thanks to Micro Crisp.
[46:37.74]Plus, Micro Crisp does what no other product has been able to do.
[46:40.72]It's so funny this shit, too, because it's like, do not put this in the microwave under any circumstances, please.
[46:47.23]Right in your microwave.
[46:47.73]Hey, throw all that out.
[46:50.11]Don't let them tell you what to do.
[46:51.27]Did the manufacturer say not to do that?
[46:56.64]Fuck them.
[46:57.74]Can you charge your phone in this?
[47:04.97]Manufactured and sold under license from one of America's largest food companies, it's proven safe and super convenient.

[57:07.38]this product is actually awesome do you know how badly I wanted to learn how to skateboard but getting onto the board was horrifying and every time I would try to do a kickflip the board just goes six yards that way it's just like into the stratosphere um so having this little thing with no wheels just to practice how to get do kickflips and stuff this actually was that's cool
[57:33.33]What I do, I, if this, if this is the DVD though, if it just plays this song.
[57:41.90]Anyone can do it.
[57:43.00]And with a little practice, you'll be pulling off it.
[57:45.55]Oh, is that just for the commercial?

[57:49.65]That's like the most royalty-free, non-royalty-free song.
[57:56.08]It's like, hey, let's make a rock song.
[57:57.88]We need to have a rock song, but we don't want to license anything.
[58:00.92]But should we hire somebody to make a song?
[58:04.27]Okay, let's hire somebody to make a song.
[58:06.05]But let's make it so there's no lyrics.
[58:08.53]And just make it like a la la la la la la la.
[58:11.38]I feel like you're... Why are there no lyrics?

[63:00.28]Don't tell Jerma about... About what?
[63:04.61]What are you talking about?
[63:06.71]About Uma Musume.
[63:07.95]He may go into cardiac arrest.
[63:11.08]People tell me about Uma Musume every fucking stream, dude.
[63:16.29]It's like every hour.
[63:29.56]Please play it.
[63:31.70]I told you.
[63:32.31]I thought it was cool.
[63:33.49]I was like, this is kind of fun looking.
[63:37.35]But I don't want to... I don't have the time commitment for it.
[63:42.31]Don't you got to really get involved and go for it?
[63:46.48]Just play it for like an hour.
[63:47.76]I feel like if I played that for an hour, you would be very upset with me.
[63:51.36]That's not a you play the game for like 10 minutes kind of a game.
[63:54.29]You play the game for 10 hours.
[63:57.69]It's Monster Rancher.
[63:59.95]That's fine.
[64:03.12]I respect it.
[64:05.02]I think it's a cool looking game.
[64:07.59]But I'm not playing it right now.
[64:10.15]Alright?
[64:12.59]And that's my final answer.

[64:37.65]I wouldn't be surprised if this one was great.
[64:43.64]Here we go.
[64:45.45]Does stopping short make your stuff fly?
[64:48.03]Is that backseat clutter enough to make you cry?

[65:57.58]It was a thing.

[67:40.17]No more straining.
[67:41.33]Hook and hang is perfect for the whole family.
[67:43.86]Now your car can go from this to this.
[67:50.81]What's going on?
[67:52.90]That was an abrupt end.
[67:54.89]Okay, let's be fair.
[67:56.83]This product would be good for a few different scenarios.
[68:00.09]Hanging up like a coat or... Like, I could see bags, right?
[68:03.98]But I don't think I'm putting one single out-of-the-box Chinese takeout container.
[68:10.32]I don't think that was a good use of the... To show how good it is.
[68:19.23]Hang your raw meat on it.
[68:22.01]We can leak, I don't care.
[68:23.55]Just don't look up top.
[68:26.33]This is called the Perket.
[68:29.32]The Perket.
[68:32.38]Hope it's not too loud, but let's go ahead.
[68:35.02]Hi, I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop.
[68:37.96]And if there's one thing I've learned after 25 years, you never know what's going to walk through that door, like this old-fashioned glass-perked coffee pot.
[68:46.23]In the 1950s and 60s, this was how real coffee was made.
[68:50.71]You'd wake up, smell the coffee.
[68:52.69]Oh, shit.
[68:53.17]Actually, hold on.
[68:53.98]Everybody hold on.
[68:55.08]It wasn't just a drink.
[68:56.16]It was an experience.
[68:57.50]But then coffee companies started making plastic coffee makers and instant pods that took away all the flavor.
[69:03.16]So now you pay more for coffee that doesn't taste as good.
[69:06.01]That's why I use the Perket.
[69:07.61]It's the modern version of this timeless classic.
[69:10.23]And it brews coffee the way it used to taste.
[69:12.28]That's because Perket draws the water up the stem and perks it to draw the perfect amount of flavor from the coffee.
[69:18.26]So every cup is delicious, hot, and fresh.
[69:21.67]And unlike the others, with Perket, you control the taste.
[69:24.95]Simply fill with water and add your favorite coffee.
[69:27.26]Then perk.
[69:27.98]You can see, hear, and smell coffee that's been brewed.
[69:30.94]That would be kind of good.
[69:32.16]Am I crazy?
[69:32.56]You can brew light, medium, or dark with any coffee you choose.
[69:36.51]It's lightweight with a stay-cool handle, and it rinses clean or goes right in the dishwasher.
[69:40.91]Plus, today, we're all trying to save money.
[69:43.57]Make coffee with a single-serve pod machine, and you're paying about $0.70 a cup.
[69:48.06]Brew it with my Perket, and it's about a nickel.
[69:50.32]My Perket?
[69:50.62]Wait, my Perket?
[69:51.16]Would you rather pay $6.40 for a pot of instant or $0.40 for a pot of real coffee?
[69:55.57]Well, that's an easy choice.
[69:56.67]So call now and get your Perket for just $19.99.
[70:00.03]I'll include a pack of my favorite Perkitt's old-fashioned coffee.
[70:03.44]It's been roasted the same since 1921.
[70:06.24]Plus, you'll receive the original Perkitt mug.
[70:08.52]Yes, you get the Perkitt, the old-fashioned roast, the mug, all for just $19.99.
[70:13.01]I see you got the old Perkitt pot, son.
[70:16.27]You finally woke up and smelled the coffee.
[70:19.80]Bottom line, you won't find a better deal or a better coffee anywhere, I guarantee.
[70:25.16]Okay.
[70:25.80]Okay, cool.
[70:27.93]So what's next?
[70:33.38]Hi, I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop.
[70:36.30]And after 25 years in business, there's one thing I've learned.
[70:39.37]You never know what's going to walk through that door.
[70:41.19]No, we don't.
[70:41.73]Like this old-fashioned safety razor.
[70:43.47]For almost 100 years, the single blade was the best way to shave.
[70:47.28]Soldiers, presidents, even my father used one.
[70:49.10]They probably filmed these all in one day.
[70:50.32]So why in the heck did the big razor companies start adding more and more blades?
[70:53.94]So they could charge you more and more money.
[70:55.47]I use a safety razor.
[70:56.25]I've been using it for like 20 years.
[70:57.23]Trust me, you only need one blade.
[70:58.43]I believe in it.
[70:58.97]That's why I use the new MicroTouch One.
[71:00.95]It's the modern version of this timeless classic.
[71:04.08]Even professional barbers today still only use one blade to give their clients a perfect shave.
[71:09.99]Same as my MicroTouch One.
[71:11.66]One blade gives me one perfectly smooth and comfortable shave every time.
[71:16.09]And unlike those multi-blade razors that are tough to clean so gunk can build up and make them less effective, the MicroTouch One opens up with a simple twist so you can easily rinse your blade and preserve the closest of every shave.
[71:28.30]Which means your blades will last longer.
[71:30.86]And it feels like a precision-crafted machine right at the palm of your hand.
[71:34.99]With the new MicroTouch One, I save money.
[71:37.65]And you know I like that.
[71:39.57]Plus, I get a perfectly smooth shave on my face and my beautiful bald head.
[71:44.12]Alright, who needs to take a sip out of the coffee?
[71:45.38]You're going to love this razor.
[71:46.72]So why keep shelling out big bucks for multi-blade razors that don't really last?
[71:51.08]When now you can save money and get the best shave of your life.
[71:54.35]The best shave of your entire life.
[71:55.91]For only $19.99.
[71:56.77]It comes complete with 12 blades and the deluxe travel case.
[72:00.75]But as part of this limited TV introduction, you'll get 12 more blades free.
[72:04.80]That's 24 blades, enough for a full year of smooth shaving.
[72:08.32]Yes, you get it all.
[72:09.68]And your satisfaction is guaranteed.
[72:11.86]So call or go online now.
[72:14.11]Cool.
[72:16.37]Okay.
[72:17.95]Hey, safety razors are good.
[72:19.63]I use it.
[72:20.37]I use one.
[72:25.10]I learned how to do it about 20 years ago, and I just never went back to the, like, you know, non-safety razors.
[72:35.82]Does the guy have the huge beard?
[72:36.88]Well, I... Yeah, I haven't shaved this.
[72:39.60]I haven't shaved recently.
[72:42.61]But when I would show, you know, you lather up and you got, you got to be careful though, because it is, it's a, this is a blade.
[72:47.80]It's a, it's not just, you can't just fuck around.
[72:50.28]You got to learn how to do it correctly.
[72:53.39]You have a Bluetooth beard.
[72:55.11]Is, are you saying that my beard is kind of hangs off of my face and it looks like it's superimposed onto the face?
[73:02.86]Because that, that's funny.
[73:05.83]I just want to time that person out.
[73:12.05]These are the spy-noculars.
[73:17.48]Let's see what the spy-noculars are all about.
[73:22.25]Why the spy?
[73:23.35]Oh, you just broke that lady's nose.
[73:34.71]Oh.
[73:37.67]Honey, that's the wrong way.
[73:39.27]Honey, flip them around.
[73:41.12]They're so small they fit in the palm of your hand.
[73:43.50]So lightweight you can take them anywhere.
[73:45.56]The special multi-layered HD lenses boost light transmission, cut through glare, and give you a sharper and brighter image that's unprecedented.
[73:53.45]Powerful HD spinoculars are a must-have at sports events and on vacation.
[73:58.20]Have a front-row seat wherever you go.
[74:00.60]Explore nature in Vivid HD.
[74:03.00]Really see what you've been missing.
[74:04.93]Yeah.

[74:37.15]He's looking at you right now.
[74:39.28]Hey!
[74:40.54]The instant eye width regulator and center focusing wheel that easily... I feel like that would hurt your head.
[74:45.45]I'm outdoors a lot and I love having binoculars with me.
[74:48.13]Binoculars are so small and compact, yet so powerful.
[74:51.12]They're fantastic.
[74:52.00]They're so lightweight.
[74:53.14]They're small enough to fit in even my smallest purse.
[74:55.80]So I'm never without them.
[74:57.09]These HD lenses are amazing.
[74:59.69]I mean, I've never seen such a... So I'm never fit in even my smallest purse.
[75:04.75]Could you turn around and name how many people are behind you right now?
[75:10.00]Oh.
[75:10.14]200?
[75:16.78]So I'm never without them.
[75:18.12]These HD lenses are amazing.
[75:20.70]I mean, I've never seen such intense clarity from any other binocular.
[75:24.31]I love them.
[75:25.15]You can expect to pay $200 or more for HD binoculars as powerful as these.
[75:29.64]But during this special TV offer, while supplies last, you can eliminate the middleman and get brilliant HD spinoculars at the factory direct price of only $19.95.
[75:39.56]What did that guy see?
[75:45.69]Hold on.
[75:46.97]What's the difference?
[75:48.89]Why would they give you the worst version?
[75:52.52]We're going to send you the HD ones, but we're also going to send you the early access version 0.4 version of the game as well.
[76:01.89]We want you to have both.
[76:03.91]Why are they giving you the worst version?
[76:05.15]These are the HD spinoculars with a thousand percent magnification.
[76:08.76]These don't have a tagline and they're old and don't have cool fucking laser eyes.
[76:14.25]Why are they giving you both?
[76:18.12]What did he, what did he see back here?
[76:25.59]Whoa, what is that?
[76:31.08]What is that monster?
[76:32.44]What is this thing?
[76:33.28]What did he get to see that we didn't?
[76:37.85]That thing, that looks like a combination of like a fucking hamster, a lion, and a Guinea pig.
[76:44.88]What is this thing?
[76:51.12]A hyrax?
[76:54.03]It's a marmot.
[76:56.58]That thing's crazy.
[76:59.82]She's waving to it.
[77:02.16]Alright, let's see how this one ends.
[77:13.94]Marmos are chilling.
[77:22.60]A total $250 value for only $19.95.
[77:27.33]What is he saying?
[77:32.21]What is she saying?
[77:34.28]We need to know.
[77:35.76]Oh, there he is.
[77:36.46]Okay.
[77:45.74]Can anybody look cool using binoculars?
[77:48.12]I feel like you can't.
[77:50.73]It's the one problem that they had over the last hundred years of this shit.
[77:55.17]Nobody looks cool doing this.
[77:57.56]So people go, oh, I could be, I'm going to be the binoculars guy, aren't I?
[78:01.30]If they made a cool looking binoculars, I feel like people would want to use it more.
[78:07.77]Or now you can just take your phone out.
[78:09.92]Every phone has times 200 digital zoom anyways.
[78:19.82]The easy view on the theme of HD.
[78:25.79]Uh oh, you're behind the wheel and the sun is so bright you're blinded by the light and can't see a thing.
[78:31.12]Your visor doesn't stop it so you dare to drive right into the glare.
[78:35.40]Stop blinding sun and dangerous glare with Easy View HD, the amazing fast flip-down glare blocker that blocks sun glare in a split second.
[78:42.75]Just slide Easy View HD onto any visor and that's it.
[78:45.58]I feel like this would be more obstructing, wouldn't it?
[78:47.52]No tools or assembly required.
[78:49.27]With just a flip, you've got the sun and glare neutralizing protection you need at your fingertips.
[78:53.76]Traditional car sun visors block your view and impede your vision.
[78:57.16]That's kind of true, though.
[78:58.08]EasyView HD is made of clear acrylic that you can see right through.
[79:00.46]Why wouldn't they make the whole drop-down mirror like this?
[79:05.77]Look.
[79:06.39]Morning sun makes it impossible to see.
[79:08.45]But you always have a clear view with EasyView HD.
[79:11.83]With late afternoon glare, you can't see what's ahead.
[79:14.48]But with EasyView HD, you'll be amazed at what you'll see instead.
[79:18.26]It even reduces glare from oncoming headlights.
[79:21.92]We have made so many inventions and so many things over the years.
[79:26.35]Why hasn't that, why haven't we done anything about this?
[79:30.75]It's just, oh yeah, we're just, you know, is there something wrong?
[79:34.05]Is there, everybody has this massive problem with sun blares out your vision.
[79:38.50]You can wear sunglasses in the car, but I feel like why wouldn't auto manufacturers have something just, why wouldn't the drop-down mirror be more, better than that?
[79:49.11]It's not a problem though.
[79:51.20]Yeah, but are you going to bring sunglasses everywhere you go?
[79:53.20]The windshields are tinted at the top.
[80:00.67]Not on my car.
[80:02.41]That shit's fucking brutal.
[80:09.52]Just leave them in the car.
[80:12.72]I feel like we have so much technological advances that that whole front pane could be better.
[80:18.73]Am I crazy to say that?
[80:23.56]I drive my kids from school every afternoon directly into the sun.
[80:27.81]But now with Easy View HD, I can actually see and keep my family safe.
[80:31.78]I drive nearly 100 miles each day for work.
[80:34.44]And with Easy View HD, I never... This thing actually might be kind of good.
[80:39.29]With Easy View HD, I'm a lot more comfortable and confident.
[80:41.83]This might be kind of cool.
[80:43.16]Will it work?
[80:47.96]I kind of want this.
[80:52.33]What's that do?

[88:15.01]Why are we getting a voicemail from Chef Tony?
[88:18.32]Did we see this one again?
[88:19.14]I think we already saw this one.
[88:25.43]Did we watch this one?
[88:26.87]Watch.
[88:27.59]Do you love delicious mouth-watering hot pot pie?
[88:30.00]Why was that a telephone call?

[89:35.93]These mushrooms, spinach, it's so... Alright, we did see this.
[89:39.85]Okay, we saw this one already.
[89:43.28]What about the active bright?
[89:44.58]I think this is a big light.
[89:47.71]What the fuck?
[89:50.82]What the fuck is going on?
[89:54.78]Oh, I thought this was a flashlight.
[90:05.60]This was a trend for a while, wasn't it?
[90:09.36]Ugh, it's like eating dirt.
[90:15.17]Does this actually work?
[90:20.68]Yeah, it's charcoal.
[90:23.22]I feel like people still do this.
[90:27.28]I told you it was a trend.
[90:36.84]I have many patients that come to my office for teeth whitening, but the process can cost between $400 and $600.
[90:42.40]Active Bright is a safe, cost-effective alternative, and it works quickly.
[90:47.35]Active Bright has a charcoal look, but the taste is very moussey and very refreshing.
[90:51.79]My teeth were gleaming.
[90:53.15]They were so shiny and bright, and I was really impressed.
[90:56.13]Other whitening trays and whitening strips, they take a long time, and they're very hot.
[91:01.04]So Steve is a realtor?
[91:03.28]And this looks like a dentist office, but it is not a dentist office.
[91:06.89]It's just a huge bathroom with a bunch of white stuff in it.
[91:10.81]So if you have like one eye open at two o'clock in the morning, Steve is a dentist.
[91:16.10]Like, well, I'm tired.
[91:16.95]This is an infomercial.
[91:19.19]With ActiveBright, it's the easiest and the best results I've had so far.
[91:22.74]I have heard about this.
[91:29.54]I've never done it before.
[91:30.84]I used to do that.
[91:37.13]Crest sells charcoal toothpaste.
[91:43.74]Really.
[91:45.24]Okay, well.
[91:47.30]I thought it was a flashlight.

[93:51.49]Okay, this is a dad problem, right?
[93:57.77]The kid didn't do this.
[94:00.14]It would actually be hard for anyone to actually do this.
[94:04.12]That was a child.

[94:30.79]grandparents taking your grandkids fishing is so much fun with the rocket fishing rod with the rocket fishing rod even have you guys noticed in every commercial ever the granddad is always wearing that same brightly colored orange shirt he's always got like a neon green orange bright orange shirt it is the grandpa outfit somebody said it's a taser
[95:01.67]It might just be the same guy.
[95:04.08]He's on his resume.
[95:06.42]Yeah, if you need a grandfather to be in your commercial, give me a call.
[95:11.35]I have tons of experience leaning down, doing a fist bump, pointing over yonder, and I look damn good in an orange, bright fucking orange shirt.

[95:47.71]Oh, I think that's like a Vive.
[95:52.62]Oops.
[95:57.08]Alright, did we see this one?
[96:00.05]This is a flashlight.
[96:02.79]Watch as we take a brand new flashlight to new heights.
[96:06.46]This is the Maya Light.
[96:07.94]It's the only light that can see a problem before it happens.
[96:11.40]Now you can truly see objects up to a mile away with the longest flashlight beam.
[96:15.90]That's too bright.
[96:16.45]The Maya Light.
[96:17.53]Illuminate the entire front of a house.
[96:19.31]Oh my god.
[96:19.53]The telescoping feature allows for light to reach more surface area.
[96:23.23]It's great for self-defense, emergencies, camping, and much more.
[96:28.26]It's the ideal.
[96:29.30]Find anything source of light in a dark basement.
[96:32.54]I'm going to give you one reason why I don't want this product in my house.
[96:35.99]The one reason is this.
[96:37.89]Power goes out.
[96:38.81]Boom.
[96:40.29]Oh, fuck.
[96:40.67]Everything turned off.
[96:42.36]We got to get candles.
[96:43.62]We got flashlights, right?
[96:46.10]In the dark, remembering like nine years later that you bought this thing and it's in a box with like four or five other flashlights.
[96:56.59]Oh, no, you got some lights.
[96:58.39]I guess it's hard to see.
[96:59.47]Grab a couple of lights.
[97:00.48]Let me, hand me one.
[97:01.82]That thing turning on when you're not expecting it, I feel like would be a, like, missile blowing up in your house.
[97:09.37]It would be so hard, like, rather than a little one.
[97:14.22]I mean, that's the only reason why I wouldn't want a product like this, because I know it would go into a box with three or four other flashlights, and I wouldn't remember which one was the Omega one.
[97:23.88]Leave it somewhere out in the open, specifically for emergencies.
[97:27.94]Yeah, the only way I would want one of these is if I had a spot where it was like, like it was on the wall.
[97:35.00]It was like, like this is the emergency light.
[97:37.80]Don't go into the toolbox looking for this one.
[97:41.71]Make a label.
[97:42.65]I said when the power goes out, there's no light.
[97:44.91]Yeah, let me look at my label maker that I made when there's no light.
[97:48.36]or cluttered attic because you can zoom the beam from wide to pinpoint it's ultra light has 100 000 hours of lamp light and the beam is extreme I would forget after like three or four years a mile away plus with five different modes it's the right light for any situation when you order today you'll get the mile for the special internet only discount price of just $19.99 my light comes in a one year replacement guarantee there are even more insane lights don't point that at the dog

[108:37.62]You want to learn from success, not failure.
[108:40.16]You see these checks in my hands?
[108:42.16]You knew I did it.
[108:43.37]The fact is, lots of people are making money all over the country, starting with nothing.
[108:48.43]If you don't know how, the seminar will show you exactly how.
[108:52.97]I never forget what my grandfather told me.
[108:55.36]There are two kind of people in life, the doer and the loser.
[108:59.72]Which one are you?
[109:00.92]Oh, shit.
[109:01.34]Are you sitting right where you are, working hard for years for nothing?
[109:04.47]Are you excited about watching my student making a fortune on TV?
[109:07.49]You know, many of these people started out with little or no cash and no credit, no experience.
[109:11.82]do you have a guts to step out of where you are to achieve freedom then come to my three hours success and real estate investing seminar who is this is this him on TV seminar it's not a thousand dollars it's not even five hundred dollars it's not even one hundred dollars the cover charge my friend is free free and if you're not willing to spend three free hours to learn from a self-made millionaire to maximize your opportunity you deserve to be broke

[109:41.80]This guy is wild.
[109:47.65]Oh my goodness.
[109:48.41]That was crazy.
[109:54.36]I remember seeing this on TV though.
[109:56.12]I remember there was a few of these.
[110:01.47]That was crazy.
[110:03.84]Okay.
[110:04.06]Alright.
[110:04.30]So now what do you guys think?
[110:05.58]Where do you want to go?
[110:06.76]We have some options here.
[110:08.12]The rest of these are long.
[110:09.97]we have a big compilation of 90s or go back to we get the fresh the fresh lock turbo seal from Cathy Mitchell or uh this is a blender a hand blender this one uh you know let's just do let's do this one for a minute because this one I think is just like a wood stain
[110:43.03]Amazing discoveries.
[110:43.91]We're going to show you how to turn tired old furniture into eye-catching treasures.
[110:47.43]Dingy and drab kitchen cabinets into breathtaking beauties.
[110:50.10]I'm curious.
[110:50.64]Revolutionary new QRB, the furniture refinishing system that has put an end to backbreaking sanding and scraping.
[110:56.21]Even if you've never refinished furniture before, you'll get professional results every time with the amazing QRB system.
[111:01.71]Whoa.
[111:01.99]And it's so easy.
[111:03.74]It's just like House Looker or like Visceral.
[111:08.44]Welcome to our show.
[111:08.86]Welcome to our show.
[111:10.08]Today's program is all about hidden treasure.
[111:12.84]Got your attention, huh?
[111:13.90]But before you go searching for your shovel, listen, because the kind of treasure we're talking about is in your own home right now, just waiting to be discovered.
[111:21.62]You see, it's hidden treasure that most of us think is junk.
[111:24.84]Let me show you what I'm talking about.
[111:26.04]Take a look at this old useless piece of furniture.
[111:28.41]That belongs in a junkyard or maybe someone's fireplace.
[111:30.73]What?
[111:31.53]It's probably an antique, man.
[111:32.90]Using today's amazing discovery, an amazing and genius product called QRB.
[111:37.48]I mean, we were able to make over this huge wardrobe, not in hours, but in just minutes.
[111:42.95]And it was easy, simple, and actually fun.
[111:45.68]A useless wardrobe turned into a valuable... Don't call it useless.
[111:49.08]It probably had some... It was probably a really nice thing.
[111:51.73]...hidden treasure.
[111:53.55]And look at this piece.
[111:54.99]I mean, that's ready for junk, absolutely.
[111:57.51]But look at the amazing transformation after using QRB.
[112:00.52]That's a beautiful piece of furniture.
[112:01.98]It went from having character and being interesting and having a little bit of character to it to being a stained regular piece of wood.
[112:09.71]Let me tell you a secret.
[112:10.97]We only paid $80 for this at a secondhand furniture store and we finished it with QRB.
[112:16.88]And I'm told that pieces similar to this are selling for well over $1,000.
[112:22.39]And we're going to show you with QRB how to tackle some really tough problems around the house, like those grungy kitchen cabinets or that scratched up wood floor.
[112:30.36]Would you like to see how we got all these amazing results?
[112:33.00]Let's welcome the daughter of the man who invented QRB, Lynn Gerhardt.
[112:36.96]Come on out, Lynn.
[112:39.95]Welcome to Amazing Discoveries, Lynn.
[112:40.73]Alright, let's see.
[112:41.51]Let's see how this works in real time.
[112:42.79]I want a real time demonstration.
[112:44.33]What does QRB stand for?
[112:45.63]Yeah, what does QRB stand for?
[112:47.40]Quickly restores beauty.
[112:49.12]And Mike, that's exactly what it does.
[112:51.00]Well, let's see.
[112:52.15]yuck a green table this looks like it belongs in Kermit the Frog's house look at this thing like it may look like trash but there's a treasure really I've applied the qrb remover and I've let it soften through all the old layers of paint you don't have to sand this you gotta sand this much no Mike that's too much okay this came out of the swamp take an old washcloth and it's covered in moss any of the old paint down to the bare wood
[113:17.20]that's walnut underneath you make it look so easy you make it look easy let me try it it's covered in nickelodeon slime that they put on it 10 minutes before this aired you can do it anybody can do it thanks a lot Lynn now this thing looks like it has 15 layers of paint on it but I know how you take care of this you got to get a paint scraper with a blade and scrape it down right no you might damage or scratch the wood I can actually scoop up all
[113:42.17]What is this?
[113:43.52]Oh, it's been treated.
[113:45.02]Okay, they sprayed it on and let it sit for like an hour.
[113:47.90]You just put a tablecloth over it, a flower in the middle.
[113:50.61]No one's ever going to know what's underneath, right?
[113:52.75]The nice thing about QRB is it'll work on any finish.
[113:56.04]Paint.
[113:57.04]I love this set though even varnish now I've applied the qrb remover to half the table okay that is ugly it sure is but I can actually take an old washcloth once the qrb soften the varnish and swipe it clean now Lynn you were telling me that your father invented qrb it smells probably crazy in there yeah I want you to meet him we'd love to wait we get to see dad everyone was talking I saw a bunch of people in the comments over here
[114:25.68]You sure have.
[114:26.52]Welcome to the show, Ron.
[114:28.36]Thanks, Mike.
[114:29.52]By the way, I'm noticing you're wearing an orange shirt.
[114:32.09]You got the orange shirt on.
[114:34.06]Look at these junk pieces of furniture.
[114:35.88]Are you telling me, Ron, that we're going to see dramatic results by the end of our show?
[114:39.27]We don't have a lot of time here, Ron.
[114:40.81]problem they'll be able to take off the old finish and put on a new finish and I'm not going to help them I have my own piece to do you've got your work cut out for you this is a piece of junk Ron hey I paid about 200 for this at a junk shop when I'm finished it's going to be worth about 2 000. look at all the carvings from 200 to 2 000 that's impressive from 10 000 years ago these carbons
[115:05.30]how are you fine Ian why are you in a tuxedo very simple Mike Ron said we work without mess what a better way to prove it should we start can we start can we go yeah it's probably a colorless liquid I don't think it would make a stain on you would it
[115:21.06]Now, this table looks like it cost about a dollar, Lynn.
[115:24.02]Oh, Mike, aren't you ever going to learn?
[115:25.08]With QRB, I can turn that into a treasure.
[115:27.39]Really?
[115:27.67]I just poured some of the QRB remover into this bowl.
[115:30.51]I can take a cloth and just dab the QRB on.
[115:33.20]Immediately, it'll begin to soften all that old paint.
[115:36.04]Now, this has a bunch of layers of paint, but I know with a paint remover, you've got to put a layer of QRB on, take off a layer of paint, layer of QRB, layer of paint.
[115:42.23]Oh, no, no, no, Mike.
[115:43.31]With QRB, you wait until it softens through all the layers of paint.
[115:46.69]Down to the bare wood.
[115:48.68]Wait, down to the bone?
[115:49.92]It's not going to damage the wood underneath, is it?
[115:51.82]No, QRB doesn't have any acid in it, so it's not going to bleach or damage the wood.
[115:55.83]Now, I notice that you're wearing gloves.
[115:57.10]Yeah, it's a lot cheaper than a new manicure, but if you don't have gloves, you can put on freezer bags.
[116:02.83]Give me your hands.
[116:03.29]Freezer bags.
[116:03.77]I'm gonna do this using a chemical like this I wouldn't put freezer bags on my hands well that's good now you're saying that all these layers of paint are gonna bubble up like like the paint did over here on the table you're finally starting to catch on look it's still working look at that Mike look at the open over a big handful of that paint what the paint chips over here yes bring over a big glob of paint oh these yucky paint chips
[116:26.79]Oh, and what I'm going to do is we're going to go feed this to the crew.
[116:29.05]The crew is pretty hungry today.
[116:30.46]Put that remover over this.
[116:32.06]Squeeze out those paint chips.
[116:33.38]Squeeze out the old remover?
[116:34.97]QRB does not lose its potency.
[116:36.65]That'll soften the varnish.
[116:38.16]Put those paint chips down.
[116:40.00]A little bit of remover is actually going to soften any of that varnish.
[116:43.73]I wonder what it is what is it made out of was it like acetone or something she said no acid every finish varies now watch this the varnish has already begun to soften look at that
[116:59.37]This works really fast.
[117:06.64]Look at him over there in the corner.
[117:11.33]What is he doing in the corner?
[117:13.33]That guy is... I don't know what he's doing in the corner, but he's doing something.
[117:24.99]Is he working on something?
[117:32.32]This works really fast.
[117:32.80]Now, a painted piece, especially if it's got 15, 20 layers of paint on it, it's going to take a little bit longer.
[117:38.13]Ah, but the secret is QRB does the work.
[117:41.27]Right after it's applied, you just sit back, have a cup of coffee, play with the kids.
[117:46.12]We don't have that kind of time now because I have two more pieces I've got to show you.
[117:49.86]Okay, we're going to check in on these pieces later.
[117:52.57]Come on, Winnie.
[117:52.87]Now, Lynn, what is this?
[117:54.53]This is a real piece of junk.
[117:56.01]No, Mike, this is a nice piece of furniture.
[117:57.77]What does this guy have in his house of furniture?
[117:59.40]This is a 1920s piece of art deco.
[118:01.76]Unfortunately, Grandma didn't have QRB, so she took the easy way out and painted it.
[118:06.63]I'll say it looks like a piece of art yucko now.
[118:09.83]I've applied the QRB to half of it.
[118:12.57]Once it's softened, Mike, I can take an old cloth and actually swipe all the old paint down to the bare wood.
[118:20.84]Look at the wood underneath.
[118:21.42]Isn't that beautiful?
[118:21.87]It's beautiful.
[118:24.68]I noticed I was wearing a mask.
[118:26.06]Mike, this is going to be an heirloom when it's finished.
[118:28.66]Is this okay to breathe in?
[118:29.78]It doesn't soften the glue joints.
[118:31.89]Mike, it's not even going to lift the veneer on the corners.
[118:35.07]But what about all these little nooks and crannies, these hand carvings?
[118:37.57]You have to sandblast that or chisel it out or something, don't you?
[118:40.10]No, Mike, I'm not going to do it.
[118:42.30]You do it.
[118:46.00]I'm going to do this.
[118:46.90]No, I can't.
[118:47.45]Look, it comes right out of there.
[118:52.27]Come over here.
[118:52.59]I want to show you something else.
[118:53.85]Again, I've applied the QRB remover to half of the table.
[118:56.78]The remover, let me do that.
[118:58.08]I'll take the remover off.
[118:59.16]I'll get the trash can over here.
[119:00.69]Put the old remover in here.
[119:01.55]No, Mike, what are you doing with the trash can?
[119:03.49]I told you, QRB doesn't lose its potency.
[119:07.04]You can use it over again.
[119:08.14]Do you just reuse it forever?
[119:10.14]Okay.
[119:11.52]No, I told you, it doesn't degrade ever.
[119:15.72]What is that?
[119:17.75]I wonder what it is.
[119:18.17]That is gorgeous.
[119:18.53]Now we have to let this dry, and then we have to sand it down, and we don't have time for that, so let's go on to the next part.
[119:23.62]Mike, with most finishes, but with QRB Instant Finish, there's no waiting.
[119:28.17]Immediately, I can put on a new finish.
[119:31.13]with a paper towel not a brush Mike you don't even get fingerprints look at that now that has to dry and then we have to sand it or steel wool it or something right with most finishes but with qrb it's a lot simpler than that I can take a piece of notebook paper forcing it down into the grain while it's something about guys there's something about this that hits the the like monkey brain that we all have
[119:57.86]watching somebody just look at it comes off right when I do that when I clean it something about just showing a live just look at this thing become a little cleaner while I put my cloth on it it's just wow and it was just like you put it on and you sprinkle it on and it just like wipes it's House Flipper brain it is it really is this 20 minutes we're not going to watch this whole one we'll skip ahead
[120:28.05]Okay, look at how big this is.
[120:30.86]This peak right here.
[120:32.00]Let's see.
[120:33.32]And to make sure of that, I've got the QRB easy steps to refinishing.
[120:38.49]Mike, this is a $50 value.
[120:40.53]Okay, but how much for Amazing Discoveries?
[120:41.98]$39.95.
[120:42.82]A $50 value for $39.95.

[120:52.30]Well, you're getting there.

[122:55.22]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[123:03.18]I'll be right back.
[123:05.68]uh we'll do a few more of these I only plan to stream for about three hours so we'll get through a few more of these and uh I'll probably call it but I had this I still had this like playlist of all these things still so uh we'll keep going I will be back in a few minutes
[128:37.27]Come back.
[128:40.54]Yeah, maybe we'll do one more of these, the longer compilations.
[128:45.92]Like I said, I was only planning on going for about two to three hours, so we got time for like one or two more.
[128:57.66]And I'll be live again on Thursday.
[128:58.96]I think I was talking to the horse men.
[129:05.23]And we were thinking about doing something on Thursday.
[129:10.65]You're gonna do part two.
[129:15.25]Um, I love doing this.
[129:24.07]Clearing out the catalog of the commercials.
[129:26.66]The best part about doing
[129:28.91]of react content like this is I am genuinely interested in all these commercials like my favorite thing so I usually like a little cool down between them though so it doesn't get so so it's still fun and still like special I don't want to dilute it too much
[129:52.97]But I'll do it sooner than it has been.
[129:56.78]Last time I did this was like a year ago, or like six or seven months ago or something.
[130:02.63]I'll do it more often.
[130:06.33]Alright, let's do this 90s one, and we'll probably call it after this.
[130:13.28]Yeah, this is a 30-minute compilation of 90s commercials.
[130:18.11]Let's see how it is.
[130:24.36]Let me make sure you can hear it.
[130:52.44]I feel like going from machine guns to baseballs I love cheerios
[131:22.53]oh look at the dog this is what it was okay this is this whole commercial is what it felt like being in the 90s every day it just felt like a giant car wash with like funny dogs and stuff time for Batman the animated series on fox 32 alfred
[131:51.57]What's that guy?
[131:54.48]And now, Batman, the animated series.
[131:59.60]Oh, fuck.
[132:01.77]No, we missed it.
[132:03.63]There's only one.
[132:04.83]Fast Tracks.
[132:07.03]Fast Tracks.
[132:08.76]The fastest radio-controlled track vehicle in the world.
[132:12.04]Climb tougher.
[132:13.42]Break on faster.
[132:14.78]With rechargeable 9.6 V turbo power.
[132:17.65]Nothing else even comes close.
[132:19.69]Fast Tracks 360s.
[132:20.99]Fast Tracks goes where you've never gone before.
[132:26.94]9.6 V turbo fast.
[132:28.88]Whoa, that was fucking crazy.
[132:31.55]That's hard to do.
[132:33.29]That is not easy.
[132:34.29]That was not a camera trick.
[132:36.83]Let me tell you, this was my labubu, okay?
[132:41.34]Back in the day, it was RC cars.
[132:44.29]And what did you have?
[132:45.09]What did you have for an RC car?
[132:49.47]You can -2 of that all you want.
[132:50.66]This was my labubu.
[132:54.11]It's like, oh dude, I got the turbo super flip machine.
[132:57.92]I had this thing.
[132:59.66]I don't know.
[133:00.18]I don't remember what it was called, but I had the coolest RC car.
[133:03.31]It was at the peak of the Lububu Dubai chocolate RC car craze.
[133:08.96]I had, I think the thing was called the rebound.
[133:12.60]This RC car could go, could drive if it was upside down or right side up.
[133:20.08]This thing was a tank.
[133:21.92]You could drive this thing off a cliff.
[133:23.90]I think even in the commercial, they drive it off a cliff and it tumbles down into a ravine and it goes on upside down and it's still drivable.
[133:32.43]It was awesome.
[133:35.37]I had, I thought I had the best one.
[133:39.00]You could run it into a wall and it would flip and keep going.
[133:41.12]That's right.
[133:41.56]That's absolutely right.
[133:42.56]It was the best RC car.
[133:44.40]So when I show up to the block party with my rebound,
[133:49.24]Everyone's like, oh, you've got that one?
[133:54.51]Let me see what I got.
[133:56.77]I pulled that rebound out and just fucking demolished everybody in races.
[134:04.80]It scuffed up your mom's kitchen walls.
[134:08.48]Yeah, well, my labubu can do that too.
[134:16.76]Uh...
[134:19.23]This is going to seem... I don't want to sound rude saying this, but it's a joke.
[134:25.68]RC car rebound Chad versus the labubu chocolate virgin.
[134:37.42]I have a labubu, okay?
[134:40.10]So it's fine.
[134:46.28]I have the boob I have one okay I'm part of the craze tracks and fast tracks pickup only from taiko battery pack required sold separately show us are you lying there I was with bunny stop talking
[135:05.63]So he'll do the hard work.
[135:23.73]Can I talk about this too?
[135:32.65]I think something that's wrong with the world, and this might be capitalism Andy speaking, I don't know how you're going to interpret this, but I feel like young kids' characters and fun, I feel like when I was younger,
[135:46.78]That quicks rabbit was like, that was my, he was, oh yeah, the quicks rabbit.
[135:52.00]Dude's fucking crazy.
[135:53.77]I feel like kids nowadays aren't like growing up with like things that are theirs.
[135:58.67]That like it's theirs, truly.
[136:01.42]Because you could say that like, well, this is advertising to children that's bad.
[136:06.02]And in a lot of ways, a lot of this stuff could be bad, right?
[136:09.61]But I think a lot of younger people these days aren't growing up with things that they get to truly claim as theirs.
[136:20.27]Quick was awesome.
[136:21.43]Yeah.
[136:23.04]Nestle, Quick.
[136:29.09]What did I say?
[136:29.59]Quicks?
[136:33.94]But I felt, we talked about Ronald McDonald recently too, about all this.
[136:38.69]I feel like Ronald McDonald was not for necessarily for adults.
[136:42.49]It was for kids, right?
[136:44.18]And, well, you're selling fucking cheeseburgers to five-year-olds.
[136:49.43]That's kind of, isn't that kind of predatory?
[136:52.78]And that is true.
[136:54.36]It could be.
[136:55.60]But I think that when I was younger, Ronald McDonald was just like a funny guy that I, oh yeah, that's Ronald McDonald.
[137:01.67]He's cool.
[137:02.17]I like him.
[137:03.33]I feel like a lot of young kids are losing out on actually like things that they get to be, that is for them.
[137:11.10]Yeah.
[137:12.60]Because, like, what is, like, a thing that is for, like, hey, this is a character that you kind of grow up with that's, like, for you?
[137:22.23]The Grimace Fortnite shake?
[137:25.52]Skibidi Toilets and stuff?
[137:26.84]Skibidi... Bluey... Yeah, no, don't get me wrong, there still are good things like this, but I feel like the connection that you make to, like, certain media...
[137:45.79]Kids are now targeted by social media algorithms.
[137:50.04]And the damage that that could be doing versus the quick rabbit.
[137:54.89]What's the difference?
[137:55.87]Do you know what I mean?
[137:56.85]The difference between a social media algorithm downloading crazy shit into a kid's brain every day versus what we just saw right here.
[138:05.73]Like, I have my imagination and I'm playing with the quick rabbit.
[138:09.77]I don't know.
[138:14.36]I feel like this was, like, creative.
[138:19.59]And interesting.
[138:20.97]And on the scale of, like, damage to do?
[138:28.56]I don't know.
[138:28.90]I feel like a... I don't know.
[138:32.00]I might just be old thinking about this.
[138:34.41]It's a fair point, old man.
[138:39.11]Did the Nesquik bunny say fuck?
[138:40.91]What?
[138:44.23]We're stealing all the world's chocolate.
[138:47.22]We have to stop her.
[138:48.56]I'll distract her with some Kwik.
[138:50.14]And I'll tie her up.
[138:51.28]Chocolaty Kwik?
[138:54.83]Looks like she's tongue-tied, too.
[138:56.39]Who are you talking to?
[138:57.87]Um, nobody.
[139:00.66]Nestle Kwik.
[139:01.78]It's magic in the making.
[139:04.75]no you guys heard wrong what are you doing I'm making a beautiful bouquet of flowers how with my fantastic flowers flower making set wow so many colors they smell pretty alright last point I'll make on this I made this point like a few months ago or whatever it was you pathetic I didn't what um I think that kids media there needs to be a total renaissance of children's media
[139:33.49]I think there needs to be an absolute complete and total renaissance of what media and things are for and designed for young kids.
[139:45.57]So much stuff is just slopping around out there and the curation of young kids content and it's just, it feels like there needs to be a total renaissance in that space.
[140:01.82]I think about the stuff that I grew up watching and thinking and caring about and seeing it is a different world it is a totally different world one that's like really hard to regulate and manage it um especially with the the rise obviously of of ai coming into play here it's going to get really hard to do anything um to you know prevent you from seeing things maybe you don't want your kids to see or because back in the day it was a television set that
[140:28.05]oh there's dear old dad and oh and by the way that we're watching this was one or two tvs in the whole house um so I think that we need like a total renaissance of stuff geared towards a younger audience
[140:47.71]not 1955 anymore right and I I'm not talking about like oh man we need to go back to the way it used to be when fred flintstone was selling cigarettes to kids right that no that's not what I mean I just mean that there was like a window of people making really really interesting creative things for about 20 to 30 years that I grew up with that I look around I just see
[141:11.13]Man, kids don't really have that much great content to care about and love.
[141:17.28]And it's a lot of kind of live service stuff and algorithm junk.
[141:22.15]But, you know, I could talk about this longer.
[141:29.86]But let's watch more commercials.
[141:33.93]What could we mean, Mom?
[141:36.61]Fantastic.
[141:37.39]Fantastic flowers made by me.

[146:36.58]Look at how much time, how much interesting shit's going on on the screen.
[146:39.49]So much effort went into this.
[146:43.30]It's so, it's just so wild.
[146:45.39]I miss it.
[146:57.00]Even that shot alone is worth it.
[147:00.66]This is early brain rot?
[147:02.23]No, it's not.
[147:02.97]It was more than 10 seconds.
[147:09.56]We're not gonna see that.
[147:23.22]There's a lot of old shows too that I don't even know if they're curated anymore.
[147:49.87]I'm sure there's a few seasons probably, but who owns the even property rights?

[149:18.82]All the magic of Disney's newest adventure, Aladdin.
[149:22.00]Is that a Chucky doll?
[149:23.74]Make me a prince so I can marry Jasmine.
[149:30.51]Who is that guy?
[149:33.33]I don't know who that guy is.
[149:34.11]Not another prince, but Jasmine.
[149:36.82]Aladdin is cute.
[149:37.80]He's had them talk to each other.
[149:41.43]Dude, that close-up of the doll or action figure turning and the little girl talking as the character was a staple of every one of these.
[149:52.89]It's just that turn, here's my dialog.
[149:56.38]It was so dramatic.
[150:01.56]I wanted this so bad when I was younger you have no idea
[150:31.40]Ten levels where monster machines get totally in your face.
[150:36.49]Grandma.
[150:37.41]Battle Clash.
[150:38.17]It's more than a game.
[150:39.23]It's a breakthrough.
[150:40.25]Have you been inside all day?
[150:42.46]Only on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
[150:44.52]Now you're playing with super power.
[150:46.79]I wanted it.
[150:48.25]I don't think I've ever used it before.
[150:50.72]Here we go.
[150:52.36]Could be more disgusting.
[150:53.56]How about some bubbling boils and green glock?
[150:56.79]Now I'm losing my lunch.
[150:58.59]Monster Face, the gruesome monster head you make and remake into the most monstrous monsters imaginable.
[151:04.94]Then you bring it to life.
[151:07.07]Now for the test.
[151:12.09]It works!
[151:12.30]Monster Face comes with everything shown here.
[151:16.74]Funny story, a long time ago, like I want to say four or five years ago, I wanted to get all the Dr. Dreadfuls and do a Dr. Dreadful stream where I made all this shit.
[151:30.27]Unfortunately, they don't really make this shit anymore.
[151:34.30]And the ones that you could buy were from like 10 plus years, 20 plus years ago.
[151:41.58]So I don't think I would want to eat any of it.
[151:44.79]And I don't think it would have worked.
[151:46.29]It probably would have been the powders and stuff probably wouldn't have worked anymore.
[151:49.79]Probably was expired and didn't mix.
[151:53.41]But I did look into it for a while.
[151:58.64]Get the poppin' cookin' stuff.
[152:00.04]It's the same thing.
[152:00.82]It is not the same thing.
[152:02.16]The poppin' cookin' stuff did not have a thing you press and edible boogers come out of a device's nose.
[152:10.57]I'm sorry, that's not even close.
[152:13.19]No, it's not.
[152:15.25]There was not a skull that you opened and there was like a gummy brain that you made in the skull.
[152:21.28]That's not the same thing.
[152:28.97]I have a memory of somebody I know owning this.
[152:40.08]And it worked and it was fun.
[152:43.02]terminator I'm back terminator's heavy metal cycle zeroes in and fires but his evil t-1000 tries to get even terminator deploys his secret weapon baby terminator explodes
[153:02.50]You control the steering.
[153:03.84]You set the pace.
[153:05.08]Now take them in the high bank curve at full speed.
[153:08.94]Turn the wheel to change lanes.
[153:10.50]Slot cars were so fun.
[153:11.57]They were so hard to use, though.
[153:15.19]Now try to steer clear before you hit the danger zone.
[153:20.80]Total control racing.
[153:24.82]TCR high bank speedway from Daigo.
[153:27.99]If you did it a little too far, they would just fly off the track.
[153:34.69]Daddy, you can feel it again.
[153:38.46]Now, guess her favorite.
[153:40.58]Smells like cherries.
[153:41.92]My baby all gone.
[153:45.26]You make it all gone.
[153:46.38]The baby's going to choke.
[153:47.84]That's too fast.
[153:49.95]My baby all gone.
[153:52.17]This is baby all gone.
[153:53.63]Baby all gone comes with everything you see here.
[153:56.39]That is going into the lungs.
[153:58.21]These two guys have a lot to say about Home Alone 2.
[154:01.66]This ain't like the last time.
[154:05.30]May I do the thinking, please?
[154:07.59]America's number one comedy hit.
[154:11.55]Okay, if my top ten video games of all time is allowed to have my top ten movies of all time, this is like number five or six.
[154:18.86]Tombstone for Christmas.
[154:28.63]Oh no.
[154:29.17]Not one of the babies that goes to the bathroom.
[154:37.53]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[154:43.76]I'm skipping this with them.
[154:48.03]You piss in and flush the toilet?
[154:53.54]I didn't know that they pissed in the toilet.
[155:03.83]Saturday morning.
[155:04.75]Be here when the mightiest mouse of all time battles the bad guys and makes the world safe.
[155:08.94]Well, what do you think it did?
[155:10.50]I didn't think he was like filled up a toilet with pee.
[155:14.59]He's the real big cheese, only smaller.
[155:16.99]It's Mighty Mouse.
[155:18.37]Don't miss the fun on Mighty Mouse.
[155:19.94]The new adventures this Saturday morning on Fox.
[155:22.76]Mighty Mouse.
[155:25.13]Let's watch Batman.
[155:30.27]I'm eating.
[155:31.71]It's just a commercial.
[155:36.42]Why is it always Batman?
[155:44.59]Because this probably was... Whoa.
[155:49.74]This probably was captured from... It was probably the commercials that aired during Batman.
[155:58.23]So it pulled from the lineup of commercials during Batman.
[156:02.82]Now order Domino's and get your Domino's $25 million Nintendo Instant Win Game Card.

[156:36.21]Benny moved this way.
[156:37.45]She reacts that way.
[156:38.86]Makes her stop and cut quicker than ever.
[156:42.38]Shoes in the 90s had such insane gimmicks.
[156:45.66]Who wants to get a game?
[156:47.78]Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if some of these had literally rocket fuel in the heels.
[156:53.71]Yo, Kevin.

[156:56.60]Kevin.

[157:32.70]That's gotta be a local box anchor or something, right?
[157:42.89]There's no way that made it 95% of the time.
[157:48.75]This is not going to be another Bob show.
[157:53.73]Tiny bones?
[157:55.92]The baby has real bones?
[158:09.25]Those kids will always have to be Lucky Charms.
[158:11.61]Part of this complete breakfast.
[158:14.20]With Marshmallow Moon's hearts in horseshoes.
[158:18.32]Horseshoes?
[158:20.08]To help me escape, that's what I use.
[158:22.15]My magical marshmallow purple horseshoes.

[158:32.94]I remember this thing!
[158:39.27]That thing was so cool!
[158:50.98]There's a little quiz.
[158:57.11]Isn't it so crazy that we could see this?
[159:03.74]When I was younger, I don't know what the... Technology has come so far and our brains have been molded by the digital world at this point.
[159:14.67]The footage that they show us for what we are witnessing when we play the game
[159:19.45]You must destroy the penguin.
[159:21.09]Oh, yeah, that's that's what we're doing.
[159:23.89]And it was fine.

[159:39.75]I thought this was like, yeah, this is great.
[159:41.25]This is exactly what it is.
[159:42.13]The penguin himself.
[159:43.53]You don't really think you'll win, do you?
[159:46.38]Yes.
[159:46.48]The Batman Returns handheld electronic game.
[159:49.12]It really made you feel like Batman.
[159:50.78]Weren't you like 24 when these came out?
[160:00.11]I was like probably 11.
[160:03.05]Or 12.
[160:03.83]Listen up.
[160:06.08]Sonic 2 is here with 10 levels and a fresh new half pipe.
[160:10.14]A casino zone, his new buddy Tails, and blast processing which makes him faster than ever.
[160:16.74]I miss the old SEGA versus Nintendo feud.
[160:20.97]They got mean back in the day.
[160:33.36]All I wanted was a big bowl of Kellogg's cinnamon mini buns.
[160:36.49]But is this my last swirl of sweet cinnamon?
[160:38.47]Y'all, the console's getting long now.
[160:40.05]No, I want conflict.
[160:43.07]I want SEGA to tell me that Nintendo sucks.
[160:46.76]I want whatever the conflict in gaming.
[160:50.45]Don't just sit there.
[160:51.87]Pass the milk.
[160:53.65]How do you cure boredom?
[160:54.95]With board games!

[161:03.37]From Walt Disney Pictures, take one incredible genie, three magical wishes, dozens of wonderful new characters, and you've got Disney's all-new animated adventure, Aladdin.
[161:14.90]It's crazy that this is the original of just Aladdin coming out in theaters.
[161:18.43]Walt Disney Pictures presents from Jim Henson Productions, the hottest...
[161:22.77]You dancing fool!
[161:25.51]Family movie of the year.
[161:26.45]You are such an idiot.
[161:27.74]The Muppet Christmas Carol.
[161:29.20]Whatever.
[161:29.88]Rated G. Muppet Christmas Carol is considered by a lot of people, including movie critics, to be the best telling of that story.
[161:41.07]That's not me saying that.
[161:41.93]That's those movie critics saying that.
[161:44.41]And aficionados in the space.
[161:48.14]I've heard that that is the best telling of that story.
[161:53.03]Michael Caine is Scrooge in this movie.
[161:59.56]And the cool thing about this movie is Michael Caine in interviews said he acted as if they were real people.
[162:07.03]They weren't Muppets.
[162:07.77]He said he gave it his all as the character and pretended like he was talking to real people and treating them like real people on set.
[162:15.32]That's why the movie's so good.
[162:19.07]Because it's Michael Caine acting his ass off
[162:22.61]With the Muppets.
[162:25.02]Like, I don't care.
[162:26.10]I'm not going to do Michael Caine.
[162:27.54]I can't do it.
[162:29.18]He said it was his favorite role of his whole life.
[162:35.36]I could understand it.
[162:36.42]It's a wonderful movie if you haven't seen it.
[162:38.94]This Christmas, if you haven't seen Muppet Christmas Carol, you have to do it.
[162:45.58]But Michael Caine, oh, it's a great performance.
[162:48.44]All around, too.
[162:49.40]Not just Michael Caine.
[162:50.16]Everybody does a great job.
[162:51.41]I think it's the best telling of that story.
[162:52.93]I'm one of the critics.

[168:23.30]He would steal from Fred and hurt him.
[168:26.90]On Tiny Toon Adventures, it's Disorder in the Court.

[172:59.75]They were squishy, but firm.
[173:02.03]They were soft, but bounceable.
[173:04.68]The old Nerf balls were so great.
[173:06.20]Do they still make them the same way?
