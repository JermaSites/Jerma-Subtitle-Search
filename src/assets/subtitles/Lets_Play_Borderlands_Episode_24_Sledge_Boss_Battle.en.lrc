[00:11.04]Incendiary SMG, I'm sorry, but you are getting... Dropped.
[00:17.95]Yep.
[00:19.41]There we go.
[00:20.19]There's a patrol SMG.
[00:28.27]The fire rate is higher, but the damage is down.
[00:30.87]And I need his health.
[00:33.20]That was actually really effective.
[00:34.76]Alright, so we got a bunch of guys down there.
[00:37.48]We got a bandit raider with shields.
[00:40.06]We have a bandit raider on the side with shields, too.
[00:42.00]Alright, I naded him.
[00:48.80]I'm gonna take out this guy.
[00:51.14]Ooh, there's a lot of guys I'm nadin' over there.
[01:00.63]I'm taking damage fast.
[01:02.61]Oh wow, me too.
[01:03.57]Throw some grenades over there if you can.
[01:08.79]Are they rushing us?
[01:10.67]Uh, they are.
[01:11.45]Looks like they're about to.
[01:12.35]What do I do?
[01:20.48]Nice.
[01:22.76]The bruiser is about to die.
[01:24.84]So am I though.
[01:29.59]Nice, leveled up.
[01:31.01]I'm all good now.
[01:32.20]Full health.
[01:41.50]He dropped the machine gun.
[01:44.14]Nice.
[01:47.01]Bandit Raider!
[01:53.35]I'm gonna go flank him.
[01:55.83]There we go.
[01:56.71]Alright.
[02:02.22]Sit down.
[02:02.70]What are these guys dropping?
[02:05.34]Oh, that's only under 47.
[02:06.98]How much is this one worth over here?
[02:08.22]I got a point to put in.
[02:11.15]Did you pick it up?
[02:11.75]Uh, I think I accidentally picked it up with the machine gun.
[02:17.41]Uh, yeah.
[02:18.35]How much is it worth?
[02:18.95]I just dropped it.
[02:21.01]Uh, it's worth 800.
[02:22.27]Ah.
[02:22.41]Hold on, what did I get?
[02:37.82]coming up the stairs right now.
[02:39.90]Here, let me take that guy.
[02:56.39]There we go.
[02:57.85]Sick.
[03:00.28]Sick.
[03:02.83]I love it how when I go into it, when I go out of it, it gives me a really, like, a fire force field.
[03:07.97]So all I have to do is take out their shields and then just go into that.
[03:11.29]Hey, what's up here?
[03:12.83]I think we gotta go this way.
[03:13.83]Along these tracks.
[03:16.56]Yep.
[03:17.12]Bandit thugs.
[03:18.04]Bandit, bandit, bandit.
[03:18.94]Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.
[03:19.72]Yeah, I'm waiting for you.
[03:21.24]I'm not doing anything.
[03:21.86]Don't worry, I'm not doing anything by myself.
[03:23.48]I wouldn't be able to take these dudes.
[03:27.88]There's a guy down there.
[03:28.92]Here, you wanna snipe him?
[03:30.64]Yeah.
[03:33.58]uh... this the back of the fire and I'll take out these these shields no no you've also had uh... but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but

[04:03.08]Yep, I can deal.
[04:04.72]I'm alright.
[04:06.38]I got my bird.
[04:07.10]I got my grenades.
[04:08.16]I'm a ways away.
[04:08.68]Alright, I'm coming up closer now.
[04:10.98]I love how I get XP when you're doing all the work.
[04:14.45]Do you have shields?
[04:22.25]Uh, this guy does not.
[04:24.36]There we go.
[04:24.66]Alright.
[04:26.05]I love my grand entrance.
[04:27.27]What is that?
[04:28.59]Explosive MIRV, it's 580.
[04:30.22]Whoa, I'm using that.
[04:33.26]What is it?
[04:35.14]It's a grenade that when you throw it, it blows up into more grenades.
[04:39.58]So it's like a cluster bomb.
[04:41.40]I'll absolutely get that on.
[04:42.49]Alright, where are the other guys?
[04:46.21]Oh, we have a bandit thug on the right.
[04:48.97]Oh, shit.
[04:52.07]Their shields are out.
[04:55.26]So are these guys.
[04:55.78]Sit down, buddy.
[05:00.36]This is so much more effective when you know what you're doing.
[05:02.67]There we go.
[05:05.89]Alright.
[05:10.90]Oh, weapons chest.
[05:14.70]Ooh, SMG, please be good.

[05:22.80]Why is it so expensive?
[05:23.86]It's just not good enough for me.
[05:26.06]Can you take it so you can sell it?

[09:22.35]Or either.
[09:23.49]Alright.
[09:24.47]Apparently we're not allowed to let the guy touch us.
[09:27.47]Alright, I opened this door, dude.
[09:31.98]Alright, so, what does that do?
[09:33.30]It looks like it's the same.

[09:38.23]So this guy cannot touch us?
[09:39.97]He looks dangerous.

[10:05.60]I'm good.
[10:05.90]Don't worry.
[10:06.32]Don't worry about me.

[10:11.14]I'm throwing my bird.
[10:12.00]Oh, I'm just going to chuck nades.
[10:15.50]That's what I need.
[10:16.60]It'll just keep taking health from him and giving it back to me.
[10:22.40]You know, I'm going to respawn, actually.
[10:24.88]It's like I'm getting there faster.
[10:26.42]Guys are spawning near us.

[12:30.52]I don't know.
[12:31.05]I have my sound pretty much as low as it can go.
[12:33.11]So I can't really hear what they're saying.
[12:35.75]Yeah, so we gotta go all the way back.
[12:58.61]You gotta get like a vehicle spawner.
[13:00.57]Wait, wait, there's a door right here, dude.
[13:02.31]Oh, is there?
[13:03.91]Yeah, I just really don't want to deal with other guys right now.
[13:07.91]It's good the guy didn't lead, because we would have just ran all the way back.
[13:10.63]Right here.
[13:12.81]I'm going.
[13:14.23]See, there's a door open right here.
[13:17.05]Look at this guy.
[13:17.61]This guy's skull is a grenade.
[13:19.81]Look at that.
[13:21.13]Yikes.
[13:23.36]So we drop down and that's it.
[13:25.52]Excellent.
[13:29.07]Oh, yeah.
[13:30.05]Right there.
[13:32.45]We do have to run all the way back, though.
[13:34.95]It's alright, it's not that far.
[13:35.59]Oh, there's an enemy over there.
[13:38.88]Behind us, too.
[13:40.76]Yeah, let's just make a sprint for it.
[13:42.86]Yeah, run for it.
[13:48.94]Here, I'll initiate the travel.
[13:51.73]Just hide.
[13:52.69]I'll be alright.
[13:53.59]I got away.
[13:54.37]Through the bird.
[13:59.63]There we go.
[14:00.39]So what do we get for this?
[14:06.77]We get some kind of combat rifle or something?
[14:09.57]I think we're going to get a decent amount of money for it.
[14:12.71]Alright, let's spawn the car.
[14:14.11]This is a long ways away.
[14:17.37]Alright.
[14:18.97]I want to go with pink this time.
[14:22.33]Oh yeah, that's hot.
[14:23.55]Oh god.
[14:24.07]That's hot.
[14:26.16]Alright, so... Can we just check the map where I have to go?
[14:28.44]Yeah, I see how it's pretty far away.
[14:31.94]I'll guide you.
[14:32.56]Alright, I'll just drive this way.
[14:36.05]Seem good?
[14:36.89]Yep.
[14:37.57]Then just bend around this corner.
[14:41.69]And then you want to go... Oh, we got more jobs from the job board now.
[14:46.15]Oh, cool.
[14:48.40]And then bang a left.
[14:50.42]If you can.
[14:51.12]Yep.
[14:52.46]Follow this.
[14:55.20]Oh yeah, here it's pretty straight forward from here.
[14:58.31]Yeah.
[14:59.71]It's pretty much straight the whole way now.
[15:07.49]Yeah, we're almost there.
[15:08.93]Here we are.
[15:09.29]Alright.
[15:10.91]You want me to run and turn it in?
[15:14.81]Let's do it.
[15:15.21]Let's see what we got for this.
[15:23.85]What?
[15:24.99]Wait, what?
[15:26.33]It says turn in, right?
[15:28.83]It's not letting me.
[15:30.91]Oh, I think you gotta turn it into somebody, like an actual person.
[15:35.23]Maybe it's Zed.
[15:35.89]Oh, yeah, it's Zed.
[15:37.33]Yeah, it is Zed.
[15:39.19]Oh, yeah.
[15:40.07]What do we get?
[15:43.17]We get A, a class little mod thing.
[15:48.15]Alright, let me see what that is.
[15:50.67]It's like specific to your class.
[15:54.45]I didn't get one.
[15:55.83]Oh, wait, you didn't?
[15:58.14]Nope.
[15:58.24]Are you sure?
[15:58.70]Check your inventory.
[15:59.96]Yeah, I did.
[16:01.76]Wait, what is it?
[16:02.58]What class mod is it?
[16:04.20]It's in the lower right of your equipped weapons.
[16:08.04]Oh, wait, it switched my equipped one?
[16:09.86]Because I had a different one.
[16:11.04]I'm pretty sure.
[16:12.93]Is it a defender class mod?
[16:15.47]I think we both get a different one.
[16:17.49]It's just like a class specific one.
[16:21.09]So the one that I got is survivor class mod.
[16:24.24]+2 team health regeneration and plus one to fast hand skill.
[16:30.00]So we regen health +2.
[16:32.56]Both.
[16:32.80]What was this last quest called?
[16:35.42]The one that we just turned in?
[16:36.75]Yeah.
[16:38.61]Uh, it's something to kill Sledge.
[16:40.25]It was about killing that guy Sledge.
[16:48.03]Um... By the...
