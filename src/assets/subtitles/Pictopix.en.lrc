[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.40]First thing I say when I look over here is, Jerma, I'm so disappointed in you.
[00:06.20]Why?
[00:06.54]I didn't even have a chance to turn in my homework.
[00:13.55]I just, okay.
[00:15.21]It was Saturday and Sunday went by.
[00:17.97]You were running a school.
[00:19.00]You're the teacher.
[00:20.84]I come into class.
[00:22.97]It's been, it's Saturday and Sunday.
[00:24.91]It's Monday morning at school.
[00:26.65]I have my backpack, I've got my textbooks.
[00:29.26]I sit down in the seat at math 103.
[00:33.36]Teacher looks at me and goes, Jeremy, I'm incredibly disappointed with you.
[00:38.43]I didn't even get a chance to do anything.
[00:42.39]I just sat down, I was ready to learn.
[00:51.46]30 months up, that's a long time.
[00:52.96]God damn, you guys are fast.
[01:01.51]This is not gonna be relaxing?
[01:03.99]Yes it is.
[01:11.69]Imagine not being in Math 104 in 2019.
[01:19.75]Backseating stream?
[01:20.93]No, it's not.
[01:21.59]I know what I'm doing in Picross.
[01:24.49]By the way, sorry to disappoint all 10,000 of you that just came to the stream right now.
[01:31.29]But today, we're going to play Picross with chat.
[01:36.53]This was a democracy.
[01:37.67]It was voted on.
[01:41.08]I didn't pick this.
[01:42.62]I mean, I put- I made it available.
[01:48.26]This was a pre-stream vote that came down to it.
[01:53.79]And we're gonna hang out and just relax.
[01:57.11]Everyone's gonna be calm and collected.
[01:59.17]We're gonna do some Picross puzzles.
[02:03.71]We're gonna hang out.
[02:05.33]We're gonna have, you know, ResidentSleeper waiting room for Sims 4 mods tomorrow.
[02:10.55]I'm sure I'll see that a thousand times because that's what's happening tomorrow.
[02:26.28]No, this is gonna be fun.
[02:27.60]Look, I've had... The VR has been so intense.
[02:33.16]I gotta shut off for a little while.
[02:37.92]So I'm gonna play Picross, this Twitch integration.
[02:45.03]Are you really playing?
[02:45.61]Oh yeah, that's tomorrow.
[02:48.32]There's a first-person mod for The Sims 4 that I want to try.
[02:55.78]There's also a couple other things that I have not enabled.
[02:58.78]But I need to play first-person Sims.
[03:05.23]He's never going to play Seaman.
[03:06.63]Yes, I will.
[03:08.61]Can you please beat the Abyss Watchers in Sims 4?
[03:13.77]We don't talk about that stream.
[03:15.63]We bury that.
[03:22.68]God, that's the most fucked up I've ever been.
[03:26.22]I was just like mentally fucking all over the place with that stream.
[03:31.32]Puzzle streams will never be relaxing.
[03:33.28]Just you wait.
[03:33.80]I don't know what time it is, where you are.
[03:36.58]I don't know what you're doing right now.
[03:39.34]But you made it here.
[03:40.10]And we're gonna take that opportunity to fill in squares on a grid.
[03:46.44]I will explain it.
[03:47.22]I will tell you step-by-step instructions.
[03:56.89]So please, like, get in bed with your iPhone or your iPad, scrunch your neck down and your chin into your chest, lying on your back, because it's fucking impossible.
[04:06.40]Can somebody please invent something to watch TV in bed?
[04:11.90]And I'm not talking about one of those giant pillows you put with the chair pillows.
[04:16.81]Why is there no device that attaches to your neck, like, locks around your neck like a collar, and mechanically, like, like, lifts your fucking head up, and there's, like, pulls it up, like, out of its socket almost.
[04:30.80]And then there's a crane arm that has your iPhone or your iPad attached to it up around, like, almost like a desk lamp in front of your face.
[04:43.44]Hi, nobody's made that yet.
[04:46.40]You're yelling.
[04:46.86]This is supposed to be real.
[04:47.58]I'm sorry.
[04:50.38]I'm sorry.
[04:50.84]I'm sorry.
[04:51.16]I'm sorry.
[04:53.34]We're supposed to be chill.
[04:54.46]I don't know.
[04:54.88]Okay.
[04:55.16]Let me.
[04:55.42]I'm gonna give you.
[04:56.02]I'm gonna give you a real reality of something that happened today.
[05:00.39]Okay.
[05:01.13]I don't know why I did this.
[05:02.93]But this is for real.
[05:03.73]This is not a joke.
[05:06.31]Picross stream.
[05:08.95]I drank a 12 ounce Red Bull before this stream.
[05:12.37]And I don't fucking drink that shit.
[05:16.31]I don't know why I decided to do that today.
[05:21.21]Forget about all the intense shit that all the VR streams.
[05:24.43]No, today is the day that I decide to drink a fucking Red Bull.
[05:31.66]That's not how you relax.
[05:33.04]It has, okay, it had Pac-Man on it.
[05:37.78]That's why I was like, I have to drink this.
[05:42.80]Like, fucking my hands are moving and stuff.
[05:45.22]I'm gonna have to relax.
[05:56.47]I don't know why I did that.
[05:59.79]I don't know why, but I have no reason.
[06:02.47]I just want to make sure everyone's very clear before I get started here.
[06:08.36]Some of you might be expecting this.
[06:09.72]This is probably a joke.
[06:11.75]Oh, and that's like a funny bit.
[06:13.03]Like, what are we actually doing today?
[06:15.75]No, this is what we're doing today.
[06:17.89]I just want to make that clear.
[06:23.93]I need that.
[06:24.49]I have to make that clear.
[06:28.05]There it is.
[06:29.65]You can tell by the Super Mario blocks.
[06:32.93]Is there audio here?
[06:36.58]And again, I'm telling you, I'm going to go... Oh, shit.
[06:39.13]What did I just do?
[06:42.61]ResidentSleeper.
[06:51.81]Now, everybody relax.
[06:55.91]You know, don't make me do it.
[06:57.19]I'll do it.
[06:58.01]We talked about it in the pre-stream chat.
[06:59.65]I'll do it.
[07:03.78]You guys that were here before the stream started, you know what I'm talking about.
[07:15.08]Don't test me here.
[07:16.20]I'll put on four and a half hour slow mode.
[07:21.02]So you only get one message for the whole stream.
[07:29.65]Yeah, I'm gonna force you to relax.
[07:34.20]Two messages.
[07:35.05]Ah, that's right, that's right.
[07:38.07]I'm automatically putting a limit here of a four and a half hour stream.
[07:41.59]I know nobody said that.
[07:45.86]What do you mean nobody photos for this?
[07:47.70]I had an extreme elimination, pre-stream elimination tournament.
[07:56.28]So let's, let's do it.
[07:59.00]Everybody just chill out.
[08:00.86]Welcome to the stream.
[08:02.26]And if you're like, fuck this guy.
[08:04.68]See you tomorrow.
[08:05.28]That's fine.
[08:05.78]I'll see you tomorrow for The Sims 4 mods.
[08:11.33]But no, I bet you this is, you know what?
[08:12.87]You know, I bet you this is going to be one of my most viewed streams this year.
[08:20.03]Anyone want to raise their hand and take that fucking auction?
[08:27.98]Because I kind of don't.
[08:31.66]Anyways, so here we go.
[08:34.00]By the way, there is Twitch integration.
[08:35.94]And I don't know how it works yet.
[08:38.70]Let's see.
[08:42.83]Does it work?
[08:45.91]Big Bits just came in right now.
[08:48.17]From Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[08:52.53]Thank you, Great Canadian, for the $50 donation.
[08:57.18]Appreciate it.
[08:58.44]No, you can't!
[08:59.08]Don't get out of bed!
[09:00.26]Stay in bed!
[09:03.00]I'm getting a little heated right now and I'm supposed to be relaxing.
[09:06.08]Uh, Great Canadian, thank you so much.
[09:07.24]I'm not going to bed and you can't make me, Dad.
[09:15.90]This Twitch integration, I don't know how it works.
[09:18.02]I think you can do, like, exclamation point...
[09:24.45]But let's get through the tutorial.
[09:25.95]Let me explain how this works, okay?
[09:27.72]I don't need to read any of this shit down here, because I can tell you how it works.
[09:36.12]But, Great Canadian, thank you so much for the $50.
[09:38.32]Alright, relax.
[09:39.60]Everybody.
[09:41.35]Let's not accuse.
[09:44.53]Ready?
[09:45.47]Let me explain how this works.
[09:49.29]As you said that, I got out of my bed.
[09:51.45]Alright, that's enough.
[10:01.68]Alright, alright, alright everything relax how this I see the chat I can't even fucking relax It's hard to relax with this like a bunch of fucking noises over here.
[10:10.80]Okay, so pick Ross guys This is how this works You get a grid It could be five by five.
[10:19.77]It could be ten by ten and people are this is Twitch integration right here How did you guys figure how'd you guys do that?
[10:28.00]Is this you guys down here?
[10:29.22]Why is there only two people?
[10:38.25]Yeah, you guys don't think I got a secure password?
[10:41.13]That's fucking 86 characters long.
[10:43.65]Good luck.
[10:45.99]Alright, here you go.
[10:49.21]Here are your chat commands.
[10:51.29]I guess I can see them down there.
[11:01.89]Maybe you can check the commands, maybe?
[11:04.64]Oh, Jesus.
[11:06.80]Oh, no.
[11:07.62]No, no, no, no, no.
[11:08.68]No, no, this is not relaxing.
[11:13.19]This is spam.
[11:14.55]This is spam.
[11:15.09]This is not relaxing at all.
[11:23.37]Anyways, let me...
[11:32.52]I gotta turn that off.
[11:34.00]Alright, don't befo- no, goodbye, all of you.
[11:37.18]Don't- stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop with the integration shit.
[11:41.21]It doesn't mean anything yet.
[11:42.43]Let me tell you how to play the game.
[11:45.41]Get outta here!
[11:56.82]Okay.
[11:58.82]So you got a grid, it's a 5x5 grid.
[12:03.14]Okay, you have a 5x5 grid.
[12:05.02]Stop it!
[12:05.94]Okay, I'm turning it off.
[12:07.24]No, I'm not.
[12:08.08]Six hour slow-mo.
[12:08.96]Do it.
[12:09.24]Don't do it yet.
[12:09.90]Don't do it yet.
[12:10.30]I'm kidding.
[12:12.03]So, how you... You got a grid.
[12:15.77]There's numbers as you see on the top and on the left.
[12:18.43]You know, this is for you guys, not for me.
[12:21.55]So the grid... I can't relax.
[12:26.29]I can't do this.
[12:26.97]I'm such a fucked up person.
[12:29.01]I'm never gonna be able to do this stream.
[12:32.54]You understand?
[12:33.34]It's like I'm fucking tied down in a chair right now and I'm like turning into the Hulk and I just want to explode out of the chair.
[12:40.28]Shh.
[12:40.84]Alright, we're good.
[12:43.03]So, what you have to do... What you have to do... Is... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:52.05]That's not right.
[12:53.39]Okay, I need to relax.
[12:57.84]so the numbers corresponding on the I have to close the chat I have to minimize the chat right now I can't see what you guys are saying I would be so bad under pressure I could never work for the cia I'll let you okay if I was working for the cia and they had to like get me to say something to do something or I was gonna crack just put up a Twitch chat next to my face ask me questions and then watch like the fail fishes and lul's that I see out of the corner of my eye
[13:24.92]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[13:26.00]I'd crack in a second.
[13:27.58]You could, like, rip my fingernails off, and I would be like, I'll never tell!
[13:30.78]I'll never talk, motherfucker!
[13:33.06]You put, like, a Twitch chat into the left of my eyes, and they're doing L-O-L-U-Ls, I'll be like, okay, so... Okay, so, uh, are they laughing at me, or, uh... Okay, so, uh, the base is at coordinates 495 by... Anyways.
[13:54.38]So.
[13:55.49]You get a grid here.
[13:57.07]There are numbers at the top, numbers at the left.
[13:59.69]You fill in squares.
[14:01.47]See how I'm doing this?
[14:03.58]Not that one, not that one.
[14:05.94]The numbers on the top and the left, this is how many squares you need to fill in in this column here.
[14:13.78]Same thing on this side.
[14:14.73]So there are five squares that need to be filled in here.
[14:18.05]And there's only five spaces.
[14:19.75]So deducing with deduction technology, we've deduced that all five squares need to be filled in.
[14:26.12]Take a look over here on the left.
[14:27.73]Only one square on this row needs to be filled in, and guess what?
[14:32.29]It was filled in by us doing this 5.
[14:33.83]We've logically deduced that this is the only one.
[14:38.02]So therefore, it is now grayed out.
[14:40.16]Take a look over here.
[14:41.44]This says 0.
[14:43.38]As you are well aware, 0 means none, so there are no squares to fill in here.
[14:47.83]Got it?
[14:50.19]So therefore, there are three that need to be filled in here.
[14:53.98]There's one here already.
[14:55.02]So guess what?
[14:55.90]One, two, three.
[14:57.54]That's where it goes.
[14:59.26]Notice how now we have our three.
[15:01.40]We've deducted with our technological brains.
[15:03.94]Same thing here.
[15:04.64]See, one and one.
[15:05.42]You're probably asking, what the heck's going on with the two ones?
[15:09.17]Well, just relax.
[15:11.11]I'll tell you.
[15:12.65]This means that there is a space of at least one square
[15:17.95]between these two numbers.
[15:20.25]So as you see, we have one here.
[15:23.37]So this is one of the ones, it's probably the second one, considering that this is already filled in, no more squares are allowed to be here.
[15:31.74]So our one space one, there has to be at least one empty space.
[15:37.99]Same thing with this one.
[15:38.79]So you got one, one.
[15:40.65]Solved our first puzzle.
[15:43.01]Now I can bring the chat back up so you know.
[15:44.69]And that's F for the string, right?
[15:47.20]Everyone's gonna like say F, like rip string.
[15:50.78]Okay, so now I can bring the chat back.
[15:57.64]First thing I see is this is shit.
[16:03.13]Will you relax?
[16:07.36]So now that you know how this works, let me show you how a master does it.
[16:17.48]Did you even get to blink?
[16:21.84]That's a coffee cup.
[16:23.94]This game is called PictoPix.
[16:32.69]You get the relaxing music.
[16:34.01]They get hard.
[16:35.39]They're not easy.
[16:37.40]I'll let you guys do one in a minute, don't worry.
[16:41.35]When do we get to start relaxing?
[16:42.57]You can right now.
[16:44.45]So remember, we've got five here.
[16:47.17]Five.
[16:48.27]Five again.
[16:54.43]Just imagine you're at like a lounge.
[16:57.37]So here's another thing.
[16:58.21]You can actually stop yourself from accidentally filling in squares.
[17:04.63]So, see how we're done here?
[17:07.45]I'm going to put some X's to make sure that I don't accidentally... Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[17:11.95]So I don't click down here.
[17:15.55]This is stressing me out.
[17:16.67]This shouldn't be stressing you out at all.
[17:19.81]This should be relaxing.
[17:22.31]We had five community cubs just come in from Fitty.
[17:26.95]Thank you, Fitty, for the five community subs.
[17:30.93]It's not stressful.
[17:32.41]This game was fun when I was in kindergarten.
[17:34.05]You didn't play this in kindergarten.
[17:35.53]I can guarantee it.
[17:38.33]I 100% guarantee you did not play this in kindergarten.
[17:40.23]You weren't smart enough for it.
[17:43.69]Look, that's like a- that's a fucking, like, Legend of Zelda sword.
[17:52.20]See, now we have some more spaces.
[17:53.34]It's getting more complicated.
[17:58.84]$100 just came in.
[18:00.01]Where?
[18:04.04]What are you talking about?
[18:07.10]I'm not going to do this yet.
[18:08.61]You guys need to understand how the game is played.
[18:11.21]And I'm getting a vibe that you don't.
[18:16.01]It was $125 in gifted subs.
[18:20.33]Five tier... Wait, those were tier three subs?
[18:24.42]Oh, shit.
[18:26.54]I... Okay, those are... Why would you give... Why would you gift sub tier three subs?
[18:32.12]Oh, my God.
[18:35.83]Confiddy gave five tier three subs.
[18:37.57]That's a shitload of money.
[18:41.13]Well, congratulations to the people that got the tier three sub.
[18:47.22]We know how to play, idiot.
[18:48.48]That guy's not relaxing on what I'm permanently been.
[18:53.06]Uh, thank you.
[18:53.51]That's fucking, like, what?
[18:54.91]Hundreds of dollars or something?
[18:55.95]Hundred and, like, fifty?
[18:58.55]Two hundred?
[18:59.07]How much money is that?
[19:03.52]Is this on Steam?
[19:04.14]It is on Steam.
[19:05.44]I think it's like... They might be packs you have to buy.
[19:08.76]I'm making that up.
[19:09.64]I don't know, but it's like seven bucks.
[19:11.76]You can also get these for free online.
[19:14.96]But this one had the Twitch integration.
[19:16.38]So I was like, you know what?
[19:17.16]Why don't I like ignore everybody down here that's pressing buttons?
[19:20.82]And, you know, give it a try.
[19:23.88]So as you see, we've got the five filled in here.
[19:25.48]We have our one.
[19:26.34]Now remember, I want you all to remember.
[19:29.34]You're not remembering.
[19:31.64]Excuse me.
[19:32.50]Listen.
[19:34.59]There has to be a space here.
[19:41.13]I'm not relaxed.
[19:45.11]See, three, one, this is a one, so therefore there has to be at least one space between all of these.
[19:51.92]I'm trying, I'm sorry, and look, take a look here.
[19:55.34]What do you got?
[19:56.34]What's that, zero, five?
[19:58.10]There's only three spaces left, so fill it in.
[20:01.44]Same thing with this one, only three spaces left.
[20:03.68]Same with this one, only three spaces left.
[20:05.30]The one, one, one up here is already done.
[20:11.78]See, one, three, but Jerma, I can't get it.
[20:16.45]If there's one and three, I see one, two, three.
[20:18.75]I don't get it, no, no, no, no, relax.
[20:20.58]This is one, there's your space, there it is.
[20:23.76]Therefore, deduce with your brains, one, two, three, that has to be three in a row.
[20:30.96]Bingo, same thing over here, right?
[20:33.71]What's the deal with this one?
[20:35.03]Can you guys help?
[20:36.97]Can I get some help on this one?
[20:40.81]This one is the reverse of the other one.
[20:46.53]Take a look at that.
[20:47.65]Has to be three, space one, there it is.
[20:53.84]That's how many followers and subs I'm gonna lose in a minute.
[20:57.62]On this stream.
[20:58.40]You just didn't know.
[21:07.83]Do it yourself, stupid.
[21:16.13]Sure.
[21:25.45]I think a friend of mine has this tattooed on their chest, and they think it means strength in Chinese.
[21:35.84]I swear to God, I'm not making that up.
[21:45.41]It's not me.
[21:45.85]I don't have any tattoos.
[21:46.83]What are you talking about?
[21:50.29]Alright, let's see.
[21:51.19]Let's use our minds here.
[21:53.37]So lock in.
[21:54.55]I'm not going to click these yet.
[21:55.51]Not until we get harder.
[21:57.19]I'm going to have a panic attack.
[21:58.21]Well, relax.
[21:59.41]Because here comes a quick one.
[22:02.05]Okay, so nothing here.
[22:04.53]We got a one there, see?
[22:07.15]Same thing over here.
[22:09.13]Same thing here.
[22:10.63]So guess what?
[22:11.19]It has to be bingo.
[22:12.29]Bingo.
[22:13.07]That takes up the two.
[22:13.99]You got three.
[22:15.49]It's done.
[22:24.93]Minesweeper.
[22:25.69]This is not Minesweeper.
[22:26.88]I did it too slow.
[22:35.01]Who is this guy?
[22:35.73]My name's Jerma.
[22:37.30]If you are a puzzle enthusiast, you may have found this stream because you're like a puzzle enthusiast.
[22:42.00]I am too.
[22:43.26]And what we like to do on this stream is we check out new puzzle games and we try new mind kind of brain training games.
[22:51.46]I stream seven days a week and I stream ten hours a day.
[22:55.68]And I check out new mind brain training exercises every day.
[23:01.31]Zero, right?
[23:02.15]Take a look.
[23:04.06]There's your four.
[23:04.84]Only can be four.
[23:06.76]Now wait a minute here.
[23:08.80]This is where it gets tricky because look at this.
[23:12.14]Okay.
[23:12.64]So how are we supposed to know what the heck's going on here?
[23:15.14]I'll tell you how.
[23:15.80]Because see, there's a space here.
[23:19.85]It can't be here.
[23:20.47]It can't be here.
[23:20.95]This is the one.
[23:21.91]So there has to be a space.
[23:23.41]Two.
[23:23.69]You got it filled in.
[23:24.53]Guess what?
[23:24.93]The two is down here.
[23:25.77]Has to be right there.
[23:29.57]And then your three spot is there.
[23:31.15]Your two spot is over here.
[23:33.89]Uh, it's a baby.
[23:35.55]Yep.
[23:38.37]You must have been a cool substitute teacher.
[23:41.45]Nobody gets it.
[23:42.05]What do you mean nobody gets it?
[23:46.75]No, there's no way.
[23:50.36]How do you not get it?
[23:52.52]You don't get it.
[23:52.96]Okay, like, I'll try it again.
[23:53.86]Let's, let's, let's, shh.
[23:54.84]Relax.
[23:57.46]Some people don't get it.
[23:58.76]Ignores the nice comment.
[24:00.04]Was there a nice comment?
[24:06.14]The nice comment was, was it a bits that just came in?
[24:08.26]C4G, two thanks for the $2.50.
[24:11.06]Canceled my last bits.
[24:12.22]I changed my mind on the Picross hype.
[24:14.38]That wasn't a nice message.
[24:21.19]I've never been less relaxed.
[24:22.41]Just lean back in your chair.
[24:24.79]Go make popcorn or something.
[24:26.11]When was the last time you had popcorn?
[24:27.73]Probably been a long time.
[24:31.21]No, I'm supposed to... I'm supposed to explain this to people.
[24:34.21]Listen, okay.
[24:35.17]Here you go.
[24:35.41]For those of you that have no idea what's going on.
[24:37.36]Welcome to the stream, my name is Jerma.
[24:38.40]I do puzzle games.
[24:39.70]I stream seven days a week, ten hours a day.
[24:42.28]I've been at this for about ten years now.
[24:44.50]I have my own puzzle games that I make, too.
[24:47.00]And they involve, you know, mind teasers, brain teasers, and little twisties inside your head there.
[24:52.00]But for... What was I... I was like, explain this.
[24:53.86]Okay.
[24:54.78]So...
[24:57.98]Alright, um, how do you, uh, okay.
[25:01.23]I have to get the CIA chat thing out of my way for a second.
[25:03.99]Okay, good.
[25:06.27]Old material.
[25:10.31]I'd hit the fast forward on this part.
[25:12.61]No, you wouldn't.
[25:13.25]You would sit here and watch it.
[25:15.90]Alright, listen.
[25:17.08]Relax.
[25:19.16]So, Picross is a game where, this is a lie, the people that troll on me, they know how this works.
[25:26.47]But I'm gonna do it again, just because a shitload of people did show up after I started talking about it.
[25:35.44]Y'all, fast forward, huh?
[25:36.74]Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.
[25:39.88]Interesting.
[25:40.50]Okay.
[25:42.24]You want me to fast forward?
[26:24.43]so what you are going to do is when you take I'm not really sure how to explain this but you see on this channel we are a puzzle enthusiast stream and as you is the voice changer working
[26:58.61]No?
[27:03.35]Hold on, it's not?
[27:05.90]Oh, god damn it.
[27:14.40]Uh, so... What we do on Easter...
[27:27.21]is we are a puzzle enthusiast stream.
[27:32.20]As you see here the five is five, one, two, three, four, five in a row.
[27:43.94]What you do is you click each consecutive circle until the whole thing is filled.
[28:01.90]As you see there.
[28:05.64]Did I tell you guys the funny thing that happened to me yesterday at the drive-thru?
[28:14.40]Wow, you're going to laugh so hard at this.
[28:21.18]So I'm in the drive-thru and someone behind me
[28:29.76]decided to beep.
[28:34.82]I got out of the car and got hit in the face with an ice cream.
[28:47.23]And after... Do you guys understand this?
[28:53.35]I think I'm gonna have to re-explain it.
[29:00.19]So as you see here... Yeah, how's that?
[29:29.94]Can you hear me?
[29:30.92]Can you guys hear me?
[29:34.68]Fucking relax.
[29:37.79]So, but really though.
[29:42.11]Sadly, yes.
[29:43.37]You take that back right now or I'm gonna anti-relax.
[29:55.22]I love how people are still doing this.
[29:59.15]I wish you were mute.
[30:01.41]You don't actually wish that.
[30:03.66]Don't say something like that.
[30:05.62]You know that hurts my feelings when you say that?
[30:08.68]Think about it.
[30:09.08]You're talking to the streamer, okay?
[30:12.68]I wish the streamer was muted, okay?
[30:14.56]You understand?
[30:15.22]Okay?
[30:30.79]Get a life.
[30:32.78]It's Minecraft Chief!
[30:36.34]Now, you guys wanna play?
[30:36.94]You guys wanna play?
[30:39.98]Let's see if you've learned anything, okay?
[30:46.14]Good luck.
[30:47.54]Let's see if you've learned a damn thing.
[30:59.56]Let's see.
[31:00.64]Okay, good, good.
[31:03.30]But no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:05.02]That's not good.
[31:06.68]You didn't do that right.
[31:07.70]You didn't deduce that correctly.
[31:09.16]That's not correct.
[31:12.91]How would you know that this was here?
[31:14.21]One and one.
[31:14.77]All you know is that one is in this row and one's in this column.
[31:17.61]You can't deduce that logically here.
[31:23.98]Okay, somebody gets it, thankfully.
[31:28.85]Think about it here.
[31:29.95]What is absolutely completely yes?
[31:34.71]Okay.
[31:37.03]Something that you 100% know to be true.
[31:46.18]Three.
[31:47.32]Therefore, you have to have a space.
[31:57.63]no no no no no no no I mean that's true but you had yeah oh no that's right nevermind I'll move back what the hell was that why did I just like spam a shitload of stuff I just dumped like why am I dumping shit in chat here
[32:27.63]I'm spamming the stream right now.
[32:30.33]Did you guys remove something?
[32:31.39]Yes.
[32:31.85]Very good.
[32:32.23]Because see, notice how you got this one right.
[32:36.19]This one could not have been possible.
[32:38.94]It's been doing that the whole stream.
[32:46.12]Careful here, guys.
[32:47.06]I don't think so about that.
[32:49.46]Think about this.
[32:50.04]Okay.
[32:52.96]Okay.
[33:01.48]The chat hurts my eyes.
[33:02.42]No, you did a pretty good job.
[33:12.25]You deduced it pretty well.
[33:14.09]Nice work.
[33:17.27]You made... an anchor.
[33:19.51]Okay, now it's my turn.
[33:25.38]Yes, these are still fairly simple.
[33:28.32]No, no, no.
[33:29.22]Autoplay.
[33:33.13]alright so here we go I'll show you one too so let's take a look here remember you might be saying oh boy how am I gonna do this you're probably like gnawing at your fingernails they're just breaking off like cartoon like rocco's modern life just flying everywhere when you corn on the cobbing your fingernails listen relax how you deduce this is take a look you got one one one right
[33:58.91]But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, just, hold on.
[34:02.05]One, space, one, space, one.
[34:06.43]It fills in the whole entire row.
[34:10.62]Now you do this, if you, later on it's gonna be like 10, eight, 12, 15, four, they get huge.
[34:19.51]Count these numbers here.
[34:22.25]One, two, three, right?
[34:24.21]How many spaces are in between here?
[34:26.97]At least one, at least two.
[34:29.21]Therefore, one, two, three, four, five.
[34:31.59]It has to fill the whole row.
[34:34.88]We get it?
[34:35.30]No, you don't.
[34:40.42]At least 200 people have DM'd me on Twitter.
[34:44.37]And they're just like, Jerma, I don't understand.
[34:46.57]Can you explain the spaces thing again?
[34:48.05]I'm like, I'm trying to help you.
[34:50.31]2, space, 2.
[34:55.30]So now we have this completely deduced.
[34:56.82]We can fill these in.
[34:59.60]We don't know exactly where these are, but we do, because take a look here.
[35:02.72]2, 2.
[35:03.82]2, 2.
[35:04.14]It's as simple as that 3, because it's got to be in the middle.
[35:09.01]And there you go.
[35:09.55]Bingo, bingo.
[35:09.89]Bingo.
[35:12.66]This is second grade shit.
[35:13.84]We're warming up.
[35:20.13]Mom said it's my turn on the pick, Ross.
[35:21.49]No.
[35:24.69]You're gonna have to wait.
[35:30.65]One, three.
[35:31.05]Uh-huh.
[35:33.21]You got your three here.
[35:34.07]You got your one, two.
[35:36.69]Can we stop the stream until everyone understands?
[35:38.92]Um...
[35:46.00]No, we cannot.
[35:50.26]Can we stop the stream until everyone... How am I supposed to decide if that's happening or not?
[36:00.03]Can we stop the stream?
[36:01.17]No.
[36:04.67]Play binaural beats?
[36:06.59]Nah, you guys, you guys wanna, if you don't, if people don't start relaxing here, I'm going to play a like, a 17 hertz sound effect on, on YouTube.
[36:17.64]That's like the fierce, scary sound that makes you like, like feel horrible.
[36:23.92]I will put that on full blast.
[36:36.39]Alright, there you go, we got our middle here.
[36:40.30]So we got two in here, we got one and one, so... Remember, it can't be over on one of these sides.
[36:47.12]And obviously these, the three has to be one, two, three, one, two, three has to be in the middle here.
[36:51.98]Play binaural beats.
[36:56.14]I'm not gonna play binaural beats.
[37:02.48]Why would I play binaural beats?
[37:06.54]It's going to hurt my head.
[37:10.36]I can't do binaural.
[37:12.42]Fine, I'll try it.
[37:13.46]Not yet.
[37:13.90]In a minute.
[37:16.18]You need to relax.
[37:17.24]People are going to leave because of that shit.
[37:19.20]That's like painful.
[37:20.12]Okay, so.
[37:24.20]No, I fucked that whole thing up.
[37:37.43]There has to be three here.
[37:41.97]It's probably this.
[37:55.48]Oh, fuck.
[37:58.00]This is easy.
[38:00.24]You guys are in my head!
[38:08.74]I can do like 20 by 20 and I'm like fucked up now.
[38:17.72]I sit in bed and play this like three nights a week at like 30 by 30 grid.
[38:48.74]I can say things that I can't prove too, just wait.
[38:53.30]I like- I got lost!
[38:54.62]This is so easy!
[38:56.58]No, it can't be that.
[39:19.76]Why am I- I did like a 30x30 last night in preparation!
[39:25.60]He's pretending for views.
[39:41.75]I- I don't- I can't- I cannot believe that I can't do this.
[40:17.44]I can't relax.
[40:18.14]I can't do it.
[40:19.61]I seriously, like, I don't know what it is.
[40:22.23]I'll do the next one.
[40:23.49]I'll do the next 10 in 30 seconds each.
[40:26.39]I guarantee it.
[40:28.68]I fucking 100% guarantee it.
[40:37.02]Like, I don't know what happened.
[40:40.62]I got stuck in like a- I got stuck in like a fucking tunnel in like traffic at work.
[40:43.70]My brain ran into itself like a thousand times.
[40:46.62]Because I had- I'm trying to expla- just watch.
[40:48.18]Ready?
[40:48.44]Bingo.
[40:59.87]See?
[41:00.05]Like, I don't know what the fuck happened.
[41:02.03]I don't know what happened.
[41:02.97]I was pretending for views.
[41:03.93]Just pretend.
[41:05.22]Pretend I was pretending for views.
[41:12.73]Honest to God, pretend I was just pretending.
[41:27.15]Jerma.
[41:28.27]12D chess.
[41:28.85]Yeah, I was pretending for views.
[41:31.33]Just trying to get some like views in here.
[41:47.46]20 seconds left.
[41:48.16]I'm telling you, I'm fine.
[41:55.93]So it's either down or up.
[41:57.15]It's down here.
[41:58.59]Kind of has to be.
[42:04.49]And then 1, 1.
[42:05.17]It could be 1, 1.
[42:05.95]I know 1, 1.
[42:07.39]No, there it is.
[42:07.98]So then here's your 2, 1.
[42:12.58]It can't be down there.
[42:13.58]There you go, 2, 1.
[42:15.50]And there's your 2, 1.
[42:23.45]Lame stream guy acts like he's bad.
[42:25.11]It's so obvious that he's acting and his fans still can't tell.
[42:30.67]Stop it.
[42:33.74]Now we get real, okay?
[42:36.26]Forget about all the dumb shit that just happened.
[42:40.26]I need to relax.
[42:41.00]I need to go drink another Red Bull.
[42:42.68]And calm down.
[42:43.36]There, you see the Maka S?
[42:47.50]That's fine.
[42:47.96]We know we got zeros over here.
[42:48.98]This is like fucking 1900s piano music I have to get rid of.
[42:54.70]No, no, that, that, just relax.
[43:06.79]Alright, so... We got a 9 here.
[43:10.38]And those of you that are wondering, wait a minute, this is a 10 by 10 grid.
[43:13.84]What the heck's going on here?
[43:15.91]Well, it's very simple.
[43:17.27]You just fill in the ones that you know are certain, right?
[43:19.59]So for instance, this is zero.
[43:20.63]This is also zero.
[43:23.57]Making it a smaller area.
[43:27.12]So we know we only have to work in here.
[43:29.36]Guess what?
[43:30.78]This has to be filled in here.
[43:32.40]Has to be.
[43:33.36]Because think about it, right?
[43:34.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[43:38.14]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[43:40.66]These have to be filled in.
[43:45.13]I don't know if it's here yet or I don't know if it's here yet, but we're going to try to deduce that.
[43:49.35]Anyways, we've got 1, 1.
[43:51.57]Those of you that know, we've got the spaces here so we can mark and make sure we know that we don't have to touch these.
[43:55.80]Because there has to be a space either here or here.
[43:58.90]This is done.
[44:00.26]And so is this one.
[44:02.59]Pretty cool shit.
[44:03.09]You know what I mean?
[44:05.17]So take a look here.
[44:06.69]Guess what?
[44:07.61]Four.
[44:08.43]One, two, three.
[44:09.33]Uh-oh.
[44:10.91]Doesn't work there, but guess what works here?
[44:12.71]One, two, three, four.
[44:18.20]Oh, I see.
[44:18.82]It's a penis.
[44:19.44]It's not a penis.
[44:21.43]If it is, I will... If this is a penis, I will give a thousand community subs to myself.
[44:29.29]But it has to say penis.
[44:32.63]Like penis.
[44:36.19]A thousand community subs.
[44:38.55]I'm hoping there's not something like developer troll in here.
[44:44.43]Because that would be bad.
[44:45.75]Anyways.
[44:46.89]So we've got three this way.
[44:48.93]Two already filled in.
[44:53.14]Four this way as well.
[44:55.68]So two, we can't figure this out yet.
[44:57.36]Four.
[44:57.90]One, two, three, four.
[44:58.76]One, two, three, four.
[44:59.34]It could be in either one of these spaces.
[45:01.28]But it's not.
[45:02.92]Because look here.
[45:05.11]See, two, that doesn't work.
[45:06.61]Because it has to be here.
[45:08.71]Because that's impossible for it to be anywhere else.
[45:11.39]Four now absolutely has to be down there.
[45:15.10]Got the three already done now.
[45:16.30]Let's take a look at that four.
[45:18.32]It has to be two in a row, so it could be either here.
[45:21.80]It's not here, because there's the three.
[45:25.76]And then look at this.
[45:26.58]Perfectly lined up.
[45:27.54]Don't you just love that fucking satisfying, hyper-satisfying one?
[45:31.61]Two, it's all it could be.
[45:32.63]No, it's not.
[45:36.23]Yes, it is.
[45:42.13]Wait, what?
[45:45.56]This has to be here.
[45:48.24]Oh, fuck.
[45:48.82]It's not.
[45:51.00]Hyper satisfying.
[45:55.22]Where did we go wrong?
[45:57.00]Hold on.
[45:57.52]Where did I go wrong?
[46:00.14]This has to be there.
[46:07.69]Oh, okay.
[46:10.13]It's just so hyper satisfying when you get it.
[46:13.85]Then we've got 2.
[46:15.35]So this is filled in.
[46:18.53]So there's your 2.
[46:20.39]And 9 has to be there.
[46:21.59]No, 9 has to be here.
[46:25.83]Imagine being this smart.
[46:27.89]Imagine never being able to speak in my channel ever again as of right now.
[46:31.76]Mods, you know what to do.
[46:46.85]POWER POWER POWER POWER POWER POWER!
[46:49.00]Alright, I almost just passed out. Relax!
[46:59.00]Play Mindshow? No, I'm taking a VR break.
[47:01.00]I didn't even tell you the story of what happened when I was done with VR. Did I tell you this? What happened here?
[47:09.00]You know the reason why I'm not doing VR? It's because my skin was peeling off.
[47:16.69]Last night, the skin on my forehead, if I rubbed gently, skin was coming off of my forehead.
[47:27.23]I have- I have to stop playing VR for a little while.
[47:34.24]That's normal.
[47:35.00]Yeah, is it though?
[47:36.00]I don't think so.
[47:38.38]It's laying eggs in my head.
[47:41.88]Skin peeling off my forehead?
[47:43.22]Yeah, the valve is laying fucking half-eyed eggs in my head.
[47:47.91]Alright, let's go.
[47:49.81]So we got some 2, 2, 1.
[47:51.05]Let's see.
[47:51.43]2, space, 1, space.
[47:53.47]Okay.
[47:55.40]So the 2 definitely has to be here because it's impossible to be here.
[48:00.64]Yeah, so the 2 has to be there.
[48:05.48]Moisturize more and clean your headset.
[48:07.19]I clean my headset every time.
[48:08.31]Do you know how much I clean that headset?
[48:15.77]Every single time.
[48:18.54]Alright, so it has to be one here somewhere.
[48:19.93]One, two, three, four.
[48:22.01]One, two, three, four.
[48:23.37]So it has to be here.
[48:24.23]Alright, in the middle there.
[48:28.05]Don't know if it's up or down.
[48:31.17]We've got a two and a two.
[48:32.47]We've got a one.
[48:35.91]Didn't he say... Didn't he moisturize?
[48:37.25]I moisturize every day.
[48:39.15]If you don't moisturize every day, you've got... I mean, you kind of have some issues there.
[48:45.74]You have to moisturize.
[48:48.62]Alright, I deduced it had to be here because there's no way you can do four down here.
[48:51.55]So there's your two, the whole bottom is done.
[48:56.41]So we got two here though.
[48:59.69]Do we get to play it?
[49:00.33]You guys can do the next one.
[49:04.10]Alright, we've got two.
[49:08.08]Maybe this way.
[49:11.40]There's also one and two are here.
[49:12.96]So two has to be two space one.
[49:19.64]I want to play.
[49:20.30]You can play in a minute.
[49:23.82]1, 2, 3, 4.
[49:24.54]1, 2, 3, 4.
[49:24.68]So we got 1, 2, 3, 4.
[49:28.68]1, 2, 3, 4.
[49:29.60]Okay, there's your 1 and your 1.
[49:31.74]There's your 2.
[49:37.38]So that leaves us with a 1.
[49:40.66]And with the... Oh, that's not right.
[49:44.47]Not right.
[49:47.67]Not right.
[49:50.22]How do I undo?
[49:52.62]Why are you guys doing question marks?
[50:02.50]I can see because 1, 2, 3, 4.
[50:05.90]1, 2, 3, 4.
[50:06.34]It has to be these two.
[50:08.54]The 4 has to be in these two spots.
[50:11.34]It has to be.
[50:13.16]It's impossible for it not to be.
[50:18.22]So that's 1, space 2, 2.
[50:22.22]This is correct.
[50:26.81]So then maybe this is wrong.
[50:29.41]Oh, let me just see what it looks like here.
[50:31.19]4... No, that's correct.
[50:33.27]It has to be there.
[50:33.89]So then... Yeah, this has to be over this way.
[50:40.23]There's no way.
[50:40.83]Yeah, that's correct.
[50:44.48]What did I... I fucked up something somehow.
[50:54.44]One and two.
[50:54.96]Yeah, that has to be.
[50:55.64]Ah, shit.
[51:05.36]Where the fuck is this, then?
[51:12.04]How do I fuck that up?
[51:21.14]So maybe it has to be here.
[51:23.54]But then what the fuck happens here?
[51:28.77]No, I'll go back a little bit.
[51:31.07]I fucked it up somewhere in the very beginning.
[51:34.13]How do I restart it?
[51:34.87]Let me just restart it.
[51:36.63]Yeah, restart, restart.
[51:37.45]I need to look at it again.
[51:38.21]Because, yeah, I don't know what the hell I screwed up in the beginning here.
[51:52.39]Okay, so yeah, one, one, two, three, four.
[51:55.63]One, two, three, four.
[51:56.75]Okay.
[52:03.68]There's your two and your two.
[52:05.18]Okay, that's what I fucked up.
[52:07.40]That's what fucked up in the beginning.
[52:18.53]You're doing a bad job, not gonna lie.
[52:20.31]It's alright, you can be banned for life too.
[52:30.96]So 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[52:31.54]It has to be here.
[52:31.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[52:35.36]So then 2 can go either way.
[52:58.17]Can I be banned too?
[53:00.22]Uh, depends.
[53:01.42]Is there anything that you'd like to say about how stupid I am?
[53:07.14]Huh?
[53:09.86]Anything else you'd like to say?
[53:11.50]Anything else you want to add?
[53:15.24]You're doing a great job, not gonna lie.
[53:16.78]Thank you!
[53:19.38]Now, the one thing about Picross that's... If you mess up one tile, it throws your whole brain off.
[53:25.46]That's why I'm trying to... Once you, like, see it, you're like, oh, fuck, okay, now I get it.
[53:34.26]It has to be in here somewhere.
[53:37.50]So if this was one, if one was here, then it has to be here.
[53:42.37]Because what are you going to do?
[53:45.01]One and then two?
[53:46.15]No, that doesn't work.
[53:46.73]It has to be right there.
[53:48.69]Now, the one on the other hand, I don't know.
[53:50.84]Same thing with this one.
[53:51.40]This is one, two, two.
[53:54.73]So it could be two.
[53:55.47]Yeah, it has to be that.
[53:58.19]Or it could be here.
[54:00.57]Only knows that one's down here.
[54:02.14]And that's it for this.
[54:03.78]So this is where I fucked up last time.
[54:05.32]This is correct.
[54:08.90]Because this is the only way this can work.
[54:15.84]You know why?
[54:16.32]It's because I think for some reason this was the same thing.
[54:20.44]I thought it was 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2.
[54:21.78]That's what happened last time.
[54:24.09]What's with all the question marks?
[54:27.05]Why?
[54:27.91]Why?
[54:30.09]What did I do?
[54:31.21]I'm getting like a shitload of question marks.
[54:39.50]Okay, so...
[54:42.74]2, 2 has to be 2, 2.
[54:45.84]There can't be anything else.
[54:50.66]That leaves us with 1, 1, 2.
[54:52.20]This is done.
[54:55.13]No, it's not.
[54:56.23]Shit!
[54:58.51]What am I doing wrong here?
[54:59.99]It can't be anything else.
[55:09.12]one one two one two one it's not that am I like actually reading this wrong how one one two one two two these two were right they're absolutely correct
[55:37.90]So this has to be filled in like this then, because this is the only place I can be.
[55:40.88]I don't know, I fucked it all up somehow.
[55:51.41]Okay, there we go.
[55:54.39]There's the other two, and there's the four.
[55:56.91]Alright, it's a question mark!
[55:58.47]That's why everybody's doing question mark!
[56:01.87]That's why you're doing that!
[56:04.25]Now I understand!
[56:06.67]Oh my god.
[56:07.55]Oh my god.
[56:09.13]That's why everyone was doing that.
[56:12.03]Oh.
[56:12.15]Oh.
[56:13.57]Oh.
[56:18.20]I thought everyone was being just mean and being like question mark.
[56:21.98]Holy shit.
[56:22.56]Is he this dumb?
[56:24.08]Just wait.
[56:24.38]7, 2.
[56:25.24]There are 7, 8, 9, 10.
[56:25.84]So it's going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, space 2.
[56:26.79]Same deal right here.
[56:35.85]Let's see, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[56:37.43]Not quite enough, but we got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[56:44.14]Same thing right here.
[56:46.36]Okay, cool.
[56:48.20]That leads us to here.
[56:49.36]So these are done.
[56:51.84]Two, that's done.
[56:53.38]And two is done.
[56:54.30]I think we pretty much already figured this whole thing out because three has to be right here.
[57:00.73]Five is one, two, three, four, five.
[57:06.74]This whole top section is done.
[57:10.60]Two and then two.
[57:11.24]Look at where it has to be.
[57:12.44]Take a look.
[57:13.72]That's done.
[57:14.38]Four has to be right here.
[57:15.97]One, two, three, four, five.
[57:17.01]One, one.
[57:18.17]One, one, three.
[57:19.29]It's a key.
[57:20.63]It's a penis key.
[57:24.69]Turn off hints.
[57:25.33]You're embarrassing yourself.
[57:27.03]What hints?
[57:31.62]Turn off hints.
[57:37.16]Oh.
[57:41.12]Yeah, no, I don't need that.
[57:42.44]That's, yeah, okay.
[57:44.08]I don't need those to be on.
[57:45.46]I haven't been, I have not even been using those.
[57:49.53]One, two, three, zero.
[57:56.21]I haven't been, I didn't even know that was on.
[57:58.03]I used to do this shit in the papers.
[58:02.05]Mom said it's your turn to play.
[58:03.43]Mom can...
[58:07.52]C H M Does anyone know what that means?
[58:23.22]Oh I love when it happens, when this happens.
[58:26.80]Chuck her mouth.
[58:27.86]S S H M
[58:37.16]I love when this happens.
[58:38.02]Ready?
[58:38.34]Listen.
[58:39.94]C-H-M.
[58:43.78]He's pretending for views.
[58:46.66]He's pretending for views.
[58:48.02]I love when people say that shit because, like, I can... I can be like, yeah, I mean, whatever, you know?
[58:52.44]I'm trying to, like, come on.
[58:53.29]Alright, five.
[58:55.63]This is amazing when this happens.
[58:57.61]For those of you non-pickross enthusiasts, when you get a full row...
[59:03.32]Every one of these numbers has to start from here.
[59:05.81]All of them.
[59:06.47]So one, two, three, four, five.
[59:08.17]Done.
[59:09.55]One.
[59:09.93]Block it.
[59:10.59]One.
[59:10.81]Block it.
[59:11.31]One.
[59:11.51]Block it.
[59:12.01]One.
[59:12.21]Block it.
[59:12.75]One.
[59:12.97]Block it.
[59:13.49]One.
[59:13.71]Block it.
[59:14.13]Five.
[59:15.39]Done.
[59:16.97]C. H. M. Stop torturing- I'm having a good time.
[59:27.78]I tell you, this is gonna be my most viewed stream of the last two years.
[59:35.71]There's only 3,600 people here.
[59:37.98]I'm talking VOD 2.
[59:38.82]This is gonna have 40,000 views on the VOD.
[59:45.10]Okay, so we get 7 here.
[59:47.16]So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[59:49.92]Easy enough.
[59:52.00]Cool.
[59:53.68]So then that completes this 1, 2, 1 up here.
[59:56.52]And close both of these down.
[59:59.39]So then we have 2.
[60:02.09]2, 2.
[60:02.69]Close this down.
[60:05.37]Pretty cool.
[60:07.07]Close this one down as well.
[60:10.02]And we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[60:13.14]Nice.
[60:14.46]This one is done too.
[60:16.64]Leave this with a 4.
[60:17.50]We can only go this way.
[60:18.58]And we can only go this way.
[60:20.26]And it is a... What is that?
[60:23.72]Is that like exit of game?
[60:26.32]It is exit.
[60:29.91]Alright.
[60:30.39]You guys want to play one?
[60:31.91]You want to play one?
[60:34.43]Alright, I'm gonna let you guys play.
[60:35.41]You can have a turn, go on.
[60:54.00]Turn off slow mode so we can play.
[60:55.70]Uh, yeah, just kill slow mode for the purpose of this.
[61:04.30]No, hey, yeah, what's going on here?
[61:08.32]You guys already, there's a zero row here.
[61:11.20]There's a zero column.
[61:17.06]What are you guys doing?
[61:21.30]There has to be a space, one space one, and you've already got a zero here.
[61:28.43]You guys have got to do some undoing.
[61:37.57]shut up boomer let us handle it I'm trying I love watching I love being able to watch and see now I get to be the person that says yeah the first thing you got you got to clear all the zeros guys
[62:04.84]Oh my god.
[62:05.96]Pepe giggling.
[62:06.76]They don't know.
[62:07.94]They don't know.
[62:23.70]It's a penis.
[62:24.66]It's not.
[62:25.56]I can assure you.
[62:28.32]Wait, why is that there?
[62:29.22]That's a flora.
[62:30.62]No, that's cheating.
[62:31.78]It shouldn't be there.
[62:38.08]I mean, how do you know that's there?
[62:41.54]You don't have any way to know that.
[62:44.52]And let's have one, two, three, four, five.
[62:47.06]One, two, three, four, five.
[62:48.58]Okay, I see where you're going with this one.
[62:49.98]I wouldn't have started there, but that's okay.
[62:54.60]This is going to take you guys ages.
[62:57.67]You're going to just fill in.
[62:58.95]This was so easy.
[63:00.75]This was a really easy one.
[63:02.81]I should have given you guys the last one two times ago.
[63:12.25]Turn the counter down.
[63:13.13]I don't think I can even... I don't think I can.
[63:19.88]Yeah, look at how easy this one was.
[63:21.10]It's just one, one, one, one.
[63:22.94]Okay.
[63:35.73]That's the correct... That's the correct place to do that.
[63:38.15]Before going with the, uh... With the six...
[63:46.69]Oh my god.
[63:47.29]How does it feel?
[64:06.79]I'm confused how all this works, I'll explain it for you.
[64:09.75]So what you have here is a series of numbers, okay?
[64:13.29]For instance, 1 1 1 1 1.
[64:21.07]What are you guys doing?
[64:23.97]Yeah, good job deducing this one.
[64:28.52]How are you going to figure that out?
[64:40.61]Why is he so mean?
[64:41.71]No, I'm giving you the chat experience.
[64:46.39]You get to be the streamer now.
[64:54.04]Okay, now, excuse me.
[64:56.44]I'll take care of this for you.
[64:58.56]See, you guys don't have to do that.
[64:59.42]I'll take care of that.
[65:05.76]I can't remove these.
[65:07.89]Which ones were they?
[65:08.75]Okay, it was those ones.
[65:09.41]Good luck.
[65:20.50]I just, like, pushed you out of the way and was like, God damn it!
[65:23.20]Filled it in for you.
[65:29.94]This is our project.
[65:40.17]In the waiting room.
[65:42.50]Sims 4 mod waiting room.
[65:59.54]There they are.
[65:59.94]This is taking forever.
[66:04.56]Alright, you guys did a good job.
[66:07.32]Congratulations, you did fantastic.
[66:12.05]You made a piece of paper that you put into a piano so it auto-plays the song.
[66:16.73]Good.
[66:18.33]Alright, I won't touch it.
[66:30.99]Is this what it's like to watch this stream?
[66:34.89]No, I go faster than this, even though I make mistakes.
[66:37.49]No, it's not.
[66:38.03]I go faster than this.
[66:38.89]I don't go like, where are my glasses?
[66:41.37]One!
[66:42.44]Let's see what it is.
[66:44.42]Minecraft 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Minecraft Creepers.
[66:48.98]Alright, my turn.
[67:05.15]Smoke the herb.
[67:07.59]No, you guys did a good job, nice job.
[67:12.30]Seriously, good work.
[67:14.92]You guys deserve the win, you do.
[67:22.29]So it's gotta be in the middle here, cool.
[67:25.79]Let's see what we got.
[67:27.69]Three and then two, mm-hmm, so three again.
[67:32.08]Then there's two and two.
[67:33.56]No, there's just one two.
[67:34.54]Okay.
[67:35.64]This is two, two, two.
[67:36.86]This is four and a half.
[67:39.50]There's nothing else.
[67:40.26]It has to be there.
[67:40.90]There's your other two.
[67:43.46]And there's your last two.
[67:46.57]Sick.
[67:50.99]So slow.
[67:56.57]Relax, relax.
[67:57.73]Calm down.
[68:00.81]You guys are breathing on my neck.
[68:02.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[68:04.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[68:05.24]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[68:05.44]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[68:05.74]Okay.
[68:05.92]There's 2, 2.

[74:03.12]At least that was.
[74:06.73]I can't believe he's still playing this.
[74:08.21]This is what everybody voted for.
[74:10.45]There were like four options.
[74:14.63]You know, like, this is, everybody voted for this!
[74:22.19]I'm going by the democratic process of what people voted for.
[74:28.03]One, two, three, okay, one, two, three.
[74:31.95]And people wanted a just hangout, chill stream.
[74:42.98]And that's good.

[74:46.49]And let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[74:56.40]People can make choices they regret.
[75:14.22]Enact emergency powers and change the game.

[75:21.18]I voted for this.
[75:21.82]I'm sorry.
[75:22.38]Why would you say sorry?
[75:23.32]This is interesting.
[75:26.07]Do a 100x100 already.
[75:26.87]Do a 50x50.
[75:27.25]This is lame.
[75:27.73]We have to work our way up.
[75:44.53]I knew this was gonna happen.
[75:49.29]But I'm having a good time.
[75:53.39]I'm having a swell time.
[76:01.02]Thank you, dear.
[76:01.96]Alright, yeah, that's it.
[76:02.84]I'm putting on the fucking fear hertz.
[76:05.06]I'm putting on the 17 hertz fucking scary thing.
[76:09.60]17 hertz.
[76:10.95]Fear noise.
[76:16.73]17 hertz infrasound for anxiety uneasiness and extreme sorrow I don't think I want to play this this is going to skip I think it's going to cause me a problem I don't want to do this no it's six hours of this why would you put your headphones on listen to six hours of that I'm not doing it what about binaural beats
[76:44.69]Okay, this one is called Super Intelligence Music.
[76:48.67]Improve focus.
[76:52.18]Alright, I'm going to put on the Super Intelligence Music.
[76:56.58]Let's get this off.
[76:57.30]Okay, Super Intelligence Music.
[77:10.22]Okay.
[77:12.46]I got both headphones in.
[77:15.24]Play the brown noise.
[77:16.80]I'm not going to do that.
[77:17.52]Okay.
[77:27.37]It's working.
[77:31.58]Holy shit, this works.
[77:52.08]This works.
[77:52.54]I'm not turning it off.
[78:02.79]This makes me want to puke.
[78:06.39]It's working.
[78:06.83]I can feel it like going into my brain and telling me how to do things.
[78:19.14]I'm not putting on the brown noise.
[78:20.64]Why would I do that?
[78:35.49]Damn.
[78:37.43]Holy shit.
[78:38.13]I didn't even do that.
[78:40.77]I didn't do that.
[78:47.49]Give us the brown note.
[78:48.47]No.
[78:50.61]I'm not going to give you the brown note.
[78:52.88]I'm not going to do that.
[78:54.64]That's going to hurt somebody.
[78:59.76]I'm not going to be responsible for somebody shitting their pants.
[79:03.41]It's not even real.
[79:05.19]I don't want to shit my pants.
[79:13.40]Hmm.
[79:16.00]Hmm.
[79:16.72]Hmm.
[79:17.02]Right here.
[79:17.42]I can go.
[79:24.45]Six.
[79:25.37]Six.
[79:25.95]Six.
[79:26.61]Um.
[79:27.03]Hmm.
[79:30.39]One.
[79:30.55]No.
[79:31.96]That would make sense, because it can't be... Yep.
[79:33.68]No, wait a minute.
[79:34.62]Nope, don't know that yet.
[79:40.50]This game can't do more damage than the brown node.
[79:46.28]Brown noise is anxiety and stress reducing static.
[79:49.22]It's not shit-your-pants frequency.
[79:51.63]What?
[79:58.21]Shut up.
[79:58.79]That was a lie.
[80:00.58]Oh yeah, they call it the brown noise.
[80:05.30]It releases anxiety.
[80:10.40]Why is it called the brown noise?
[80:11.60]There's a South Park Minute episode on it.
[80:15.51]I fucked it up.
[80:23.59]I fucked it up.
[80:24.68]I'm talking about the brown noise and I fucked the whole thing up.
[80:40.20]It has to be played at 150 decibels?
[80:42.20]Yeah, you know what, that's not the sound doing that.
[80:44.64]That's the amount of noise force hitting you in the stomach, making you shit your pants.
[80:50.47]It has to do with the force of the sound coming out.
[80:55.85]Alright, I gotta, hold on a second here.
[80:58.07]Five, that's five.
[81:00.55]This might not be three here, but it has to be, so this is six.
[81:09.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[81:12.84]Versus here.
[81:15.04]I fucked this whole thing up.
[81:20.53]God damn it.
[81:21.31]I fucked it all up.
[81:23.43]I wish I could hit the undo button like a thousand times.
[81:27.91]Shit!
[81:28.91]What did I get wrong here?
[81:35.32]I got to start it over.
[81:41.70]Dammit.
[81:43.42]No, the IQ music works.
[81:44.61]I just turned over and I was like, SHITTING POOPING MUSIC, POOPOO MUSIC.
[81:49.61]And I stopped paying attention.
[82:00.17]Three.
[82:01.65]Three.
[82:02.37]Maybe this doesn't go here.
[82:06.59]No.
[82:07.13]Fuck.
[82:08.31]one two one two three four five six no no because this is three and then two it has to be here there's no way it could be over here so then this has to go away because it can't be there no way two three but what the hell
[82:40.81]I have, it's doing fine.
[82:47.25]This is, no, this is incorrect.
[82:53.51]Two, three, and then two, maybe... Fuck.
[83:02.41]I scra, I have to do it all over again.
[83:05.33]Restart, I have to do it again.
[83:07.11]You gotta, you gotta throw the whole thing in the trash sometimes.
[83:08.95]You just do.
[83:11.06]Okay, now, I'm not gonna talk about, like, shitting my pants.
[83:15.50]I'm gonna listen to the binaural sound intelligence beats.
[83:24.07]Alright, relax.
[83:24.47]I'm gonna... I just did it.
[83:25.71]No, I just... I gotta... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[83:26.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[83:26.85]3, 2, 2.
[83:26.93]Block it.
[83:27.21]Block it.
[83:27.51]Block it.
[83:27.97]Block it.
[83:39.99]Okay, this is done now.
[83:42.17]Four.
[83:43.77]Three has to be here.
[83:45.59]It's impossible for it to be anywhere else.
[83:49.55]Two has to be here.
[83:51.65]Impossible for it to be anywhere else.
[83:59.20]Six does not need to be right here.
[84:01.54]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[84:04.18]That's all I know.
[84:05.42]Three, and then three has to be right here.
[84:10.24]Impossible for it to be anywhere else.
[84:14.26]Two and then two.
[84:15.40]This is where it gets tricky.
[84:17.02]Can't be down here.
[84:20.50]Can't be.
[84:21.10]This has to be right here.
[84:22.76]Can't be anywhere else.
[84:24.96]This is now done.
[84:27.56]Two and then two.
[84:28.98]Has to be right here.
[84:30.16]It cannot be anywhere else.
[84:40.59]Now.
[84:42.91]Feel the music.
[84:45.39]Three has to be here.
[84:48.55]It cannot be anywhere else.
[84:49.82]Okay.
[84:57.08]Two.
[84:59.66]Three.
[85:00.86]Two.
[85:01.76]Three.
[85:02.12]It could be here.
[85:03.78]It's possible.
[85:08.26]This is so exciting I just shit my pants.
[85:12.13]Well, that's on you.
[85:13.79]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[85:15.79]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[85:19.15]Could be this way.
[85:20.88]Could be three.
[85:24.10]Could be two.
[85:28.60]Where's the Joe?
[85:29.28]There's no Joe.
[85:34.62]Stop looking at the chat room and get this one done.
[85:40.64]So it cannot be up here.
[85:42.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[85:43.16]It cannot be anywhere else.
[85:44.78]That's three.
[85:45.30]So one, two, three, four, five, six.
[85:47.66]Got it.
[85:48.00]That's where we screwed up before.
[85:48.96]I had one, two, three, four, five, six.
[85:52.12]Done.
[85:54.94]That's where it went so wrong before.
[85:56.68]Okay.
[85:59.92]Now the question is... Three.
[86:03.99]One.
[86:06.27]Ooh.
[86:10.29]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[86:12.23]Why, fuck.
[86:16.15]I'm not gonna brute force it.
[86:20.25]One, two, three.
[86:21.35]One, two, three.
[86:22.13]There's nothing.
[86:23.01]It can't be.
[86:28.52]Just down to this last little quadrant here.
[86:30.22]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[86:33.17]Got it.
[86:34.68]And then two has to be there.
[86:37.68]Which leads you to two.
[86:39.06]Which leads you to clear.
[86:40.32]Which leads you to two.
[86:41.86]Which leads you to two.
[86:43.28]Which leads you to one!
[86:47.95]Anybody getting smarter?
[86:50.47]It's a lightning bolt, zap.
[87:00.26]Chat's getting bored.
[87:06.35]It's okay.
[87:07.75]It's okay.
[87:09.09]It's okay.
[87:11.93]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[87:13.24]I'm not bored.
[87:18.32]Are you sure you're bored and you aren't relaxed?
[87:20.76]That's a really good question.
[87:24.62]Okay, I was about to play the brown noise in the background, but I'm actually going to get in trouble.
[87:31.19]Guys, if I play the brown noise and even one of you...
[87:34.84]Has like a direct complaint to Twitch.
[87:38.89]I could get in trouble.
[87:41.55]I play like... And like three of you get a headache.
[87:47.66]I could get like suspended.
[87:54.65]I'm not doing that.
[88:00.05]No, that's not correct.
[88:01.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[88:02.03]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[88:03.23]So it's right there.
[88:07.66]Block off those ones.
[88:11.76]I'm gonna report you.
[88:12.60]That's what I'm saying.
[88:13.50]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[88:14.38]I don't want to cause anybody a fucking, like, diarrhea headache.
[88:19.32]That's not relaxing.
[88:23.08]So it's right here.
[88:26.60]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[88:28.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[88:32.21]Melt into your bed.
[88:34.39]And if you're at the computer, if you have a chair that can recline, recline back, put the headphones in, and just look with the corner of your eye on the screen.
[88:46.98]You don't need to see much.
[88:50.92]This is not ASMR.
[89:00.98]My bed is swallowing me.
[89:02.18]Yeah, you're gonna like melt into your bed.
[89:04.70]The covers are gonna... You're gonna go down.
[89:07.82]The covers are gonna come fold up over you.

[89:13.82]You're gonna lie.
[89:14.38]Oh, I'm like sinking.
[89:15.55]This is so relaxing.
[89:18.75]And then your eyes are gonna fucking rip open and you're like buried alive in a casket.
[89:24.82]Give me the fuck out of here!
[89:37.45]Just relax.
[89:38.49]You'll feel it.
[89:42.96]I'm gonna send a complaint.

[91:57.93]We got two, five, and then one.
[92:01.09]Two, five, one.
[92:02.15]These are done.
[92:04.97]Very cool.
[92:07.01]Everything's done over here.
[92:08.27]Let's see.
[92:09.52]One, two, three.
[92:10.40]That leaves us with eight.
[92:12.60]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[92:16.28]Very nice.
[92:18.88]One, and then one.
[92:19.52]This is three.
[92:21.62]Uh-huh, and then you got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[92:23.20]And I got a couple more to do here, which is this one and this one.
[92:28.15]Look at that.
[92:30.41]Remember the good old days of Jerma when he was known for his Picross dreams?
[92:37.94]Yeah, I'm just going back to where I started.
[92:42.76]A lot of people think it was Team Fortress 2.
[92:44.04]No.
[92:44.44]If you go back to my channel, my first two to three hundred videos were Picross and tips and strategies and stuff.
[92:54.78]But before I got any sort of viewers, I deleted them all because I was like, I don't think people want to watch this.
[93:02.77]I deleted all of them.
[93:05.79]I was going to leave some up, but... And you were right to delete them.
[93:24.51]Brown nose videos.
[93:26.63]Yeah, yeah, I had like 200 Picross videos and like 60 brown nose videos.
[93:31.52]Brown noise.
[93:36.22]Brown noise.
[93:45.90]Whatever.
[93:56.23]Why would you put the JermaCraft copypasta here?
[94:01.04]It's not even completely irrelevant.
[94:02.98]It's still there.
[94:09.12]Alright, I'm going to get yelled at for going too slow.
[94:10.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, space 1.
[94:12.00]This is all filled in.
[94:13.10]2, and then 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[94:13.94]Don't know that yet.
[94:27.71]That's some good cider.
[94:30.20]Maybe I'll go get a... Should I just start drinking?
[94:33.94]No, no, no, no, no.
[94:34.68]Bad idea.
[94:35.92]No, I'm not going to do that.
[94:40.95]No, I'm not going to start drinking.
[94:41.93]If I start drinking, I'm going to have to take tomorrow off.
[94:45.87]Let me tell you something about being over 35.
[94:47.43]Under 35.
[94:47.71]By like a year or two.
[94:51.64]If I drink now, if I have like three drinks, four drinks, I literally have to take an entire day the next day lying in my bed screaming.
[95:01.99]It sucks.
[95:05.17]No, like Otto's got to go to the vet in like two days.
[95:08.57]So I'm streaming tomorrow.
[95:09.57]I don't want to have like a hangover tomorrow.
[95:11.71]I don't get like hangovers really, but I do...
[95:21.89]No, I'm hydrating right now.
[95:27.92]No, Otto's fine.
[95:29.98]Otto has to go to the vet for a very, very basic routine procedure.
[95:36.93]He's completely fine.
[95:38.41]Don't worry.
[95:44.33]That's that for that row.
[95:45.53]Ooh, closing in.
[95:46.24]I love it.
[95:48.68]When you get that shit done, and you can just, it's just, you smell it.
[95:55.62]One, two, three, four, five.
[95:57.68]One, two, three, four, five.
[95:59.04]Nice.
[96:02.04]Can't deduce where that is, though.
[96:10.63]What's with you and shitting tonight?
[96:12.47]It's not me, okay?
[96:15.86]It's you guys that have this issue.
[96:18.82]You guys telling me to play the brown noise.
[96:21.25]You guys telling me to go, like, poo my pants and stuff.
[96:23.71]I don't know what you guys are on tonight, but it's not me.
[96:28.49]I'm just reacting to it because I'm looking over and I'm like, what is going on over here?
[96:32.67]It's because you drank a Red Bull.
[96:36.33]I know.
[96:37.11]No, it's not.
[96:40.89]I didn't drink anything.
[96:48.20]Now he's flipping us off.
[97:01.23]Alright, let me finish this.
[97:04.01]So I got five right here, good.
[97:06.63]Three.
[97:07.95]That's done.
[97:09.90]My question is... This is one.
[97:13.76]I still want to have this one somehow.
[97:17.76]Three here, let's see one two three four five.
[97:20.28]Yeah, it's probably these two because I can't really know I could be any one of these They're all five This is two Five hmm, where's that one over here probably?
[97:42.59]Let's see
[97:47.25]Guess?
[97:50.65]What's the hashtag guess?
[97:57.04]It could be either one of these, because it's two.
[98:00.04]It's one and then two.
[98:05.70]One, two, three.
[98:06.70]One, two.
[98:07.26]It has to be one of these.
[98:09.16]So it's this one.
[98:10.04]One, two, three, four, five.
[98:12.25]Block it off.
[98:13.03]Got it.
[98:13.45]So this has to be two here.
[98:14.83]Done.
[98:17.02]Therefore, that's one, two, three, four, five.
[98:20.46]Therefore, that has to be like that.
[98:23.00]Therefore, here's your one, there's your two.
[98:28.20]In theory, that makes two as well.
[98:31.29]There's your one, which makes that three, which then turns into here.
[98:37.83]It's a grenade.
[98:50.52]Are they gonna get bigger?
[98:52.54]We're getting close.
[98:55.45]How was my day?
[98:56.13]My day's been pretty good.
[98:57.37]How was your day?
[98:58.11]That's more important.
[98:58.73]How was your day?
[99:00.29]Should I just get shit-faced today?
[99:01.93]And, like, we'll stream, like, in two days?
[99:10.80]Sometimes.
[99:15.56]Nope, that's not gonna fit.
[99:21.72]Do a pull.
[99:23.24]I'm not going to do a pull.
[99:24.52]That's stupid.
[99:28.19]1, 7, 5.
[99:28.25]There's your 1.
[99:30.89]There's your 1.
[99:32.45]There's your 1.
[99:33.15]There's your 1.
[99:33.75]Oh, that means... Okay, so 1, 2.
[99:40.33]Look at that.
[99:42.07]Oh, it's perfect.
[99:43.45]You see that?
[99:44.80]Did you even see what I did?
[99:46.38]I don't think you did.
[99:47.32]You weren't paying attention.
[99:54.65]This music sucks.
[99:56.43]I'll do another one then.
[99:57.11]Okay, how about, this is super intelligence.
[100:01.86]Uh, this is accelerated learning gamma waves for focus.
[100:05.20]Alright, let's put on the gamma waves one.
[100:17.44]Is it gamma?
[100:17.96]Okay, wait, hold on.
[100:18.60]Wait, wait, wait, I'm afraid to do this.
[100:20.40]Gamma waves is microwave, right?
[100:23.04]What's the one that's in the microwave?
[100:34.19]microwaves oh right that's right micro alright okay you're right uh this one's safe then he's trying to kill us it's too loud
[101:02.90]Gamma rays is what turned the Hulk into the Hulk.
[101:05.22]Well, then you should be happy I'm playing it.
[101:06.62]You know how much stronger all you guys will be?
[101:21.43]Headache.
[101:23.01]Headache.
[101:24.45]No, don't get me suspended.
[101:26.17]You're fine.
[101:26.67]Just take, like, one Tylenol.

[101:41.62]Alright, let's see.
[101:42.80]One... One... Five.
[101:51.70]So this is one, two, three, four, five.
[101:53.76]That's done.
[101:54.40]Block it up.
[101:55.97]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[101:57.91]Block it up is the one.
[102:03.56]Let's get shitfaced and abuse Tylenol.
[102:05.46]I never said that.
[102:07.37]Do not put that word in my mouth.
[102:12.55]I never- I did not say that.
[102:15.19]Absolutely not.
[102:17.25]I have my analytics here on my dashboard.
[102:20.01]It's a transcript of every word I've said on stream.
[102:33.89]No, don't.
[102:34.59]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[102:37.35]So this is one.
[102:38.13]This is free.
[102:40.23]Those of you that don't see what's going on here, there has to be a space.
[102:44.06]See what I'm talking about there?
[102:45.46]In between each number.
[102:48.72]This is just barely free.
[102:52.74]Alright, we got six.
[102:53.74]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[102:55.41]Look at that.

[103:23.07]1, 1.
[103:23.91]3.
[103:28.48]You've got something wrong here.
[103:32.60]Something's wrong.
[103:42.00]No, that's correct.
[103:43.94]No, that's good.
[103:44.58]That's fine.
[103:50.08]1, 1.

[103:54.07]Yeah.
[103:55.75]Okay, I freaked out for a second there.
[104:01.31]2.
[104:01.33]1, 2, 3.
[104:01.63]Nope.
[104:03.45]The 2 is correct.
[104:05.27]And that's done.
[104:07.42]One, two, one.
[104:08.38]We got seven here.
[104:09.54]One, two, three, four, five.
[104:11.02]It has to be at least these.
[104:13.37]This one's done.

[104:59.35]The dump truck?
[105:03.47]This one's kind of hard.
[105:04.39]I don't know if you guys can do this one.
[105:10.21]inspire butt what the hell would I click that for yeah that's not I don't want this song anymore what about like the happy frequency is there like a happy frequency happiness frequency serotonin dopamine endorphin release music I feel like we're going to we're doing like too many drugs at the same time

[105:48.61]This is not good.

[106:04.66]Alright, let's see how this one is.
[106:08.98]I'm doing- you guys wanna do one?
[106:10.60]I'll help you, and we'll do it together.
[106:14.15]What does enable continue?
[106:15.31]What does that mean?
[106:17.21]Enable continue.
[106:18.29]I think that means you can skip the level.
[106:19.97]No.
[106:21.86]Alright.
[106:23.72]Go for it.
[107:09.32]Did anybody shit?
[107:10.80]No, I didn't mean... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[107:17.09]That's the first thing I ask.
[107:18.17]Did anybody shit?
[107:20.53]Shut up, Jeremy.
[107:22.18]Get a grip.
[107:27.82]He is doing alright.
[107:33.75]By the way, I'm just testing your resolve here.
[107:37.01]That was not the brown nose.
[107:38.83]And I'm seeing everybody being real funny.
[107:45.56]That was test your speaker's low pitch.
[107:52.94]And that had nothing to do with any other brown noise frequency.
[108:01.34]How you guys doing?
[108:04.90]Then why did I shit my pants?
[108:07.72]Uh... That's probably something that you... Uh... Did you have... Like a really... Did you... Okay, here's... Let me give you some possibilities here.
[108:17.45]Did you... Did you get like a reheated in the gamma ray microwave burrito from like four days ago?
[108:24.43]That's the only pretty much possible way.
[108:35.15]Did you eat a burrito that you reheated in the microwave?
[108:44.38]If the answer is yes, then that's probably what happened.
[108:52.39]I've never had a burrito in my life.
[108:54.19]How is that possible?
[108:58.13]You've never had a burrito?
[109:00.73]In your life.
[109:03.49]I'm not American.
[109:05.71]Wow, I'm... You're missing out.
[109:08.52]They're actually really great.
[109:09.38]If you ever get a chance to have one, by all means, definitely eat one.
[109:13.34]Just don't reheat it.
[109:15.64]Eat it fresh.
[109:23.53]Gonna still play Mindshow?
[109:24.55]Yes.
[109:26.19]We just had to take a relaxing day today.
[109:32.13]Tomorrow we're doing Sims 4 mods.
[109:36.14]First person is the main one.
[109:42.23]Because I wanted to do that a while ago and I never did.
[109:48.85]What is stream legends?
[109:51.75]The bottom of the screen is just like a little game to play while you're waiting for a stream to start or just like a little thing to put in there.
[110:02.19]Mail that guy a burrito.
[110:04.73]And I wouldn't be fresh by the time it got there.
[110:10.96]Gemma, please turn this off.
[110:12.00]It's making my dog go crazy.
[110:13.52]I don't know what's going on.
[110:14.42]Wait, come on, really?
[110:17.47]That's kind of scary.
[110:18.57]Okay, I'm turning it off.
[110:36.57]I don't wanna- I'm not playing brown noise.
[110:39.61]Alright, I'm gonna play brown noise for myself to make sure it's safe.
[110:47.01]I'm muted.
[110:47.37]Let's find out.
[110:55.56]I don't- I don't like this.
[110:56.48]I don't- it's silent.
[110:58.20]I don't wanna do that.
[110:58.88]Nope.
[111:04.73]That just freaks me out.
[111:05.61]I just placebo effect.
[111:06.61]I like almost hurt myself.
[111:07.85]No.
[111:12.60]I'm sorry, guys.
[111:13.16]I'm not doing that.
[111:13.74]That was a silent video and I could feel brain pain.
[111:18.14]Nope.
[111:21.09]You could just look it up.
[111:21.73]Type in brown noise.
[111:31.11]Do you know the feeling when you first go underwater and your ears, you have that?
[111:38.47]That's what I just felt.
[111:44.75]I almost blacked out in five seconds.
[111:46.94]I'm not putting that on stream.
[112:02.11]You guys are doing pretty good.
[112:04.16]My favorite part is... Look at... Okay.
[112:08.02]Is this 37 people that are playing out of 3,500 people watching?
[112:16.72]I'm glad that you guys are having fun.
[112:19.57]Those 37 people right now, this is like they're fucking filling this in and having a good time.
[112:33.33]I wasn't paying attention when you explained the control.
[112:43.84]Jerma stocks are way down too, I saw that.
[113:00.07]Buy low.
[113:03.03]They're playing against their will, their own free will.
[113:05.27]No they're not!
[113:06.85]I could, right now, I could just fuck this whole thing up.
[113:08.80]I could click on every button, I could delete everything they did.
[113:11.20]No, they're just playing, they're having fun.
[113:16.52]This game is really cool, thanks for showing.
[113:19.30]Well, Picross is a really, really fun, relaxing, just chill thing to do.
[113:24.82]We've been doing this for two hours!
[113:27.32]Don't you guys feel like we've been here for like ten minutes?
[113:31.77]We've been here for two hours.
[113:33.09]Come on.
[113:39.78]It feels way longer.
[113:41.70]Feels like less than two.
[113:42.94]It feels like way less than two.
[113:44.28]Yeah.
[113:53.34]What's the difference between Picross and Sudoku?
[113:56.66]Sudoku is nine grids.
[114:00.74]This is a much larger scale.
[114:03.70]And this is more about making a picture than solving a math problem.
[114:11.19]I don't really play Sudoku, but I think they're very different.
[114:19.69]It feels odd without the music.
[114:21.55]I'll put something else on.
[114:22.69]Hold on.
[114:23.03]How about...
[114:26.68]royalty free um old music like what's what's some old music we can put on it's free old fashioned free film music no copyright it's the whole line isn't this just like a popular song
[114:56.04]What song is this?
[115:00.04]Somebody made this in GarageBand.
[115:04.76]I know exactly the file name that they used.
[115:07.38]They used High Trumpet 008 and Tuba 012.
[115:09.76]That's the brown noise.
[115:30.79]And it's all loops.
[115:36.41]This is adding more.
[115:38.33]This is old fashioned free film music.
[115:56.99]No!
[115:57.11]Turn that off!
[116:28.23]Okay.

[126:40.86]It's probably over here.
[126:41.60]That makes sense.

[129:04.86]Okay, guys, we have a new Nintendo VR Labo kit here.
[129:07.89]I'm going to break down the one-minute trailer in a 22-minute full video with seven ad breaks.
[129:15.27]And look, I'm going to freeze it right here for you.
[129:16.97]I thought it was one of those.
[129:22.34]Sorry, my mistake.
[129:26.71]Fucking Grammarly, goddammit.
[129:29.53]Fucking Grammarly.
[129:30.39]How do I skip to Grammarly?

[131:26.52]There is no video.
[131:37.20]Am I falling for like the fucking Facebook fake news bullshit?
[131:44.86]Did that just happen?
[131:55.36]Holy shit.
[132:03.91]Did I actually just fall for like the Ronald Reagan used to wear hats because he had devil horns and that's why he always wore hats to press conferences.
[132:12.63]Right?
[132:12.97]Did I fall for that?
[132:21.45]Jimmy Carter was four feet tall.
[132:23.57]What you don't understand is he was on stilts during press conferences and they have like a zoom in.
[132:27.61]I fell for it.
[132:33.74]Okay.
[132:39.56]The VR is real.
[132:40.42]Well, I can't wait to drink on stream again and have everybody be concerned that it's the worst stream I've ever done and it'd be probably 2019 worst stream.
[132:50.24]I'm looking forward to it.
[132:53.43]But you got this stream.
[132:54.75]So you got some competition this year, I think.
[133:03.55]The Labo streams are my favorite streams.
[133:05.85]I like them too.
[133:10.03]Alright, where were we?
[133:12.05]Show us the Labo.

[133:36.84]So you know it's not bullshit.
[133:39.65]There you go.
[133:40.45]It's real.
[133:48.87]Okay.
[133:50.19]Where the hell was I?
[133:54.11]That's Doug Bowser spreading fake news.
[134:08.62]First day on the job, you give like a fake VR kit press release.
[134:12.92]Alright, so we've got four, two, and then, yeah, so this is only, hmm, it's probably over here.
[134:25.86]No, because it's one.
[134:28.98]No, it's over here.
[134:30.80]Because this is one.
[134:33.16]That's the only place where it makes sense.
[134:36.02]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[134:37.96]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[134:39.04]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[135:41.09]Like four or five of you guys got it.
[135:44.21]Nice work.
[135:48.31]Only five of you guys out of 38,000?
[135:49.59]Come on.
[135:55.94]Let us play.
[135:56.56]You can do the next one, because I'm going to go get a Coke.

[136:05.87]Nintendo just announced Labo Picross.
[136:10.25]Well, that's wonderful.
[136:12.01]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[136:14.15]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[136:14.37]Bingo.
[136:25.54]Six, seven, eight, nine.
[136:26.82]Not quite.
[136:27.88]Not quite.
[136:35.18]I don't do drugs.
[136:35.90]What are you talking about?
[136:40.76]Hmm.
[136:43.25]Interestingly enough, I don't really have much to go on to start.
[136:46.81]It's gonna have to be down here somewhere.
[137:01.79]Where's the music?
[137:02.71]Oh, fuck.
[137:04.35]You're right.
[137:12.76]I missed the old Jerma, the one that used to do drugs on stream.
[137:15.08]Well, that Jerma never existed.
[137:16.26]You're making that up.
[137:17.00]Yeah, go ahead and put, like, the top text there of, like, me doing drugs and, like, bottom text of, like, can't believe it, he's not been banned yet.
[137:24.67]And, like, spread it out on your fucking Facebook.
[137:26.91]Because that's essentially what you just did.
[137:33.07]One, two, one, two, three, four, five.
[137:35.19]Oh, I can, yeah, I can do this.
[137:37.45]Because I forgot about this side here.
[137:43.66]Oh, yeah.
[137:45.62]I know what's real and what isn't real.
[137:49.88]Okay.
[137:51.74]So that gives us, that's one, five, five, four, two.
[137:56.03]This is done completely.
[137:57.29]That'll help us probably somewhere here.

[140:26.34]No getting prepared beforehand.
[140:28.32]I want you to take a screenshot of your Steam library the day of the competition
[140:34.01]Minutes before we start with zero game time in Pogo versus your friends.

[140:50.27]There you go, challenge issued.
[140:57.86]I'm going to get decimated?
[141:00.66]I don't think so.
[141:04.08]Loser forfeits all subs to the winner.
[141:06.42]Well, that would be, uh, pretty catastrophic.

[141:14.22]He already did that game.
[141:15.74]No, he didn't.

[144:23.36]It is correct.
[144:23.90]Now it is.
[144:24.40]But how does the game actually work?
[144:25.78]Well, I'll tell you.
[144:54.30]On the columns here.
[144:56.62]So you got like three and then you move on to, I'm going to piss up your record.
[145:06.09]Oh, right.
[145:17.15]Are you guys?
[145:17.71]Yeah.
[145:17.83]I'll just let you guys play here.
[145:24.13]No, where is it?
[145:24.63]Come on, be right back.
[145:28.68]Here.
[145:29.28]Just so people know that I'm not here.
[145:32.30]I'll activate it.
[148:55.85]Holy shit, this is awful.
[148:59.96]Did you guys even try?
[149:01.28]You're just gonna fill all the squares?
[149:17.50]You did it!
[149:18.82]You filled them all in!
[149:19.54]You win!
[149:20.08]You did it!
[149:24.69]Nice!
[149:40.16]No!
[149:40.72]Hey!
[149:41.06]I was doing something.
[149:45.72]I was writing LOL.
[149:46.44]Alright, you're done.
[149:50.02]Alright, that's it.
[149:50.58]You're done.
[149:57.72]I gotta redo the whole thing.
[150:03.08]Jerma is the upset teacher?
[150:04.35]Yeah, I came in after a rough day.
[150:09.51]And somebody drew a picture of me on the blackboard.
[150:14.36]It's very unbecoming.
[150:17.30]I got like a big nose, big like eyebrow bones, greasy hair, boogers coming out of my fucking nose.
[150:25.36]And I had a rough day.
[150:28.07]I was late to work.
[150:28.77]I spilled a coffee.
[150:29.57]I got one of those Starbucks egg and cheese wraps.
[150:34.05]And it was too hot to eat.
[150:36.15]I couldn't eat it.
[150:37.92]I wanted to eat it, but for some reason, I don't know why they do this, the Starbucks hot fucking sandwiches are 10,000 degrees.
[150:53.50]And you cannot physically eat them until they get too cold to throw in the trash.
[151:06.62]I don't throw it in the trash, God!
[151:08.40]8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[151:12.25]There it is.
[151:18.51]Who buys a sandwich from Starbucks?
[151:21.37]Working!
[151:23.31]When you've got enough time to get a sandwich, that's what I used to do.
[151:27.97]I used to go- McDonald's, man.
[151:32.49]I used to get the McDonald's drive-thru egg sandwich.
[151:35.09]Oh my God, it was amazing.
[151:39.23]People like dogging McDonald's.
[151:40.75]No, why?
[151:41.17]What's wrong with McDonald's?
[151:50.57]The BRB screen is still there.
[151:51.89]It's alright.
[151:52.19]I'll get rid of it.
[151:52.71]One, two, three.
[151:57.38]You're getting McDonald's right now?
[151:58.68]Good.
[152:00.96]I like that place.
[152:04.92]Where to talk about the top two menu items?
[152:07.61]It's the Cheesy Gordita Crunch from Taco Bell and the Big Mac from McDonald's.
[152:14.28]That is written in like the fucking food bible somewhere.
[152:21.70]Sellout?
[152:23.04]No, that's just written in the food bible of fast food.
[152:29.53]The Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the best single food item you can possibly order from a fast food restaurant.
[152:36.06]That's just true.
[152:38.10]I don't have to be sold out for that.
[152:45.26]Ghostbusters is the best movie ever made.
[152:48.14]I don't need to tell you that.
[152:49.44]You already know that.
[152:50.18]Everybody does.
[152:56.34]And Gremlins 2 is the second best movie ever made.
[153:01.14]Do I need to be paid by Paramount Pictures to tell you that?
[153:06.98]Is it just facts?
[153:09.44]Alright, uh, three.
[153:11.54]That's one.
[153:12.00]We can block these two off for now.
[153:20.24]Back to the Future 3 was the best movie.
[153:27.14]His thing about opinions, though.
[153:29.30]You know, his thing about opinions.
[153:31.77]Everybody's got one, but only mine matters.
[153:34.71]Right?
[153:36.31]And then how most people think of opinions these days.
[153:47.64]Paul Blart Mall Cop is the number one.
[153:57.40]Paul Blart Mall Cop is actually... I didn't hate that movie.
[154:04.35]I've never seen it, but I don't hate it.
[154:10.12]Alright, alright, alright, you're de-relaxing me.
[154:15.16]Let's see.
[154:20.08]441... Maybe here?
[154:27.73]Yeah, you guys have to stop de-laxing me, okay?
[154:32.82]I don't need, I don't need X-lax right now.
[154:34.38]You don't have to X-lax me.
[154:40.38]Well, let's see.
[154:40.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[154:41.24]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[154:41.54]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[154:41.99]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[154:42.11]Alright, so it's somewhere in here.
[155:05.84]You'll hate it?
[155:11.28]Use the X's more often.
[155:13.30]That's the 200 IQ strat.
[155:14.80]Yeah, I use them.
[155:17.18]I only like to use the X's when I'm certain, though.
[155:19.60]Because it throws me off if I use them too much.
[155:22.12]Because I would use them here, but I don't know.
[155:26.79]It could be 6 and then 1.
[155:29.57]Just don't know.
[155:30.13]Okay.
[155:32.67]Okay.
[155:34.67]That's completely done.
[155:35.91]Hmm.
[155:36.07]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[155:37.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[155:37.86]Doesn't really help.
[155:38.54]Middle click?
[155:39.08]What the fuck is that for?
[155:40.08]Okay, let's see.
[156:01.93]For maybes?
[156:02.82]Hmm.
[156:04.24]That's too many things for me.
[156:10.38]How do you play?
[156:12.06]Chat does a puzzle every four or five sequences.
[156:21.25]I have it currently turned off.
[156:26.92]There's one more here.
[156:28.62]Two...
[156:31.50]2 this way would make sense.
[156:32.95]But 6 this way would make sense, too.
[156:40.75]This is so easy, you nerd.
[156:42.97]You don't have to write all capitals.
[156:45.34]Okay?
[156:49.32]Let's see.
[156:52.98]4, 1... It's probably here, but... I don't know.

[159:45.36]Ant?
[159:50.01]Some type of bug?
[159:53.37]Well, that would make sense.

[169:01.22]What are you talking about?
[169:06.58]How can you sound unhealthy?
[169:12.65]These are probably the ones, right?
[169:14.43]Because then two would be here.
[169:17.37]I'm going to just do an educated guesser because that would make sense.
[169:24.44]I need a two.
[169:28.16]It wouldn't be this.
[169:35.63]That's not even a guess.
[169:36.41]That has to be that way.
[169:44.03]Whatever.
[169:47.29]Four could be... Yep.
[169:48.59]No.
[169:49.49]Well, it definitely is not this way.
[169:52.25]No, it could be.
[169:53.17]Shit.
[169:55.14]Alright, let me slow down, slow down, slow down.
[169:56.84]I can get this one here, because this is one... One?
[170:03.02]One.
[170:03.20]This is two.
[170:04.14]Where the fuck would this be?
[170:06.07]Two going down, which means two across.
[170:11.53]I don't have enough information.
[170:12.59]I don't have... He lacks critical information!
[170:15.75]Right?
[170:35.40]That's tough.
[170:47.01]Well, his three... Okay, I see it.
[170:54.76]I saw it.
[170:55.38]I know somebody was yelling at me.
[171:00.10]Now here's the real question.
[171:00.98]Where's the 2?
[171:01.44]You know what I'm saying?
[171:06.94]It could be 3 this way or 3 that way.
[171:09.29]It could be 4 this way or 4 this way.
[171:15.13]Hmm.
[171:16.33]Well, it has to be here.
[171:19.68]One of these squares is this one.
[171:31.04]I'm screaming into my monitor.
[171:44.01]No, I'm going to X out the... No, I'm not doing this.
[171:47.73]I don't want to do the maybe.
[171:49.06]It's too much more information.
[171:50.24]I already know.
[172:02.42]Well, this is three.
[172:04.22]It's three this way, too.
[172:05.22]Is that fucking three?
[172:11.66]Could this be two and then one?
[172:14.39]It's very possible.
[172:18.39]But this is one.
[172:19.39]This could be one and then one.
[172:20.61]This is one, one, two, three.
[172:24.41]Whoa!
[172:26.07]Three.
[172:35.23]one two one so therefore nope nope nope don't need any of these so it's one of these two bring it down here this is one one two one has to be here has to be one two three four five six one two three one two three
[173:06.59]1, 2, 3, 4.
[173:09.01]And then... 1, 2... Hold on.
[173:11.23]What are you guys doing?
[173:19.92]Stop asking for commands.
[173:26.18]Why is everybody laughing?
[173:30.14]What is going on over here?
[173:34.46]Why is everybody laughing so hard right now?
[173:45.59]I don't understand what the big deal is right here.
[173:50.87]We're losing their minds.
[174:01.59]He actually doesn't know.
[174:02.75]I actually don't know what you're doing.
[174:06.45]What is going on in my fucking chat room?
[174:23.66]Okay, so what?
[174:27.94]I don't get it.

[174:34.26]Someone call... I'm dying.
[174:39.02]Help me.
[174:42.04]No, now you guys don't get to do one.
[174:43.90]You've been misbehaving.
[174:48.37]This type of misbehavior and you want to turn?
[174:59.11]No, you're making me spam.
[175:02.19]Just stop spamming commands.
[175:04.53]Stop doing that.
[175:05.77]Why would you do that right now?
[175:07.23]Stop.
[175:07.51]I'm turning it off.
[175:09.78]You're dead.
[175:10.68]There's no reason to be doing what you're doing.
[175:16.50]I was watching this stream and I dropped my phone in the toilet.
[175:18.56]It's all your fault.
[175:21.90]You guys are going to fuck up my channel.
[175:34.96]Alright, let me start this.
[175:35.96]6-2.
[175:37.14]What's with all the laughter?

[178:17.46]So either this way or that way.
[178:22.05]This is a stinky home.
[178:26.31]You guys were telling me that I was on drugs.
[178:29.23]Are you sure?
[178:29.91]Did something come in here?
[178:31.49]Are you guys like breathing something in on this channel?
[178:38.68]Did, like, the fucking laugh factory open up like the fucking laughing gas on this channel?
[178:42.34]Okay, two.
[178:48.64]This is probably down here.
[178:49.53]Yep, yep, yep.

[178:59.41]One, two, three, four, possibly.
[179:02.13]Or one, two, three, four.
[179:07.65]We found your weed stash.
[179:11.39]Well, I have got really, really, really bad news for you.
[179:15.63]Marijuana is legal in Las Vegas.
[179:19.68]I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[179:32.48]Okay.
[179:33.78]Somebody said, uh, they're laughing because I'm auto-playing the brown note.
[179:37.50]You actually scared the shit out of me for a second.
[179:39.12]That would be fucked.
[179:56.36]How much have you smoked since you got- None!
[180:01.63]Okay, this is two, one, one.
[180:05.19]So then two would be here.
[180:10.39]Doubt, doubt.
[180:11.27]Yeah, I don't, I, listen.
[180:13.39]I got nothing wrong with marijuana.
[180:16.27]I don't partake in marijuana.
[180:18.31]I don't have anything, I don't have a problem with it at all.
[180:20.81]If you smoke, you do like, uh, edibis, good.
[180:26.85]I hope you fucking enjoy it.
[180:27.82]Just be careful.
[180:28.86]Do it responsibly.
[180:31.79]He's a liar.
[180:32.51]I'm not a liar.
[180:33.37]I got nothing wrong with people enjoying marijuana.
[180:46.22]I got nothing wrong with it.
[180:47.04]It's got some medical benefits.
[180:48.08]You know that I know that?
[180:53.54]I know it.
[180:55.96]Okay, this is getting... We're pretty much done here.
[181:04.30]Is it a turkey?
[181:04.80]It's a mailbox.
[181:06.22]Why is everybody laughing?
[181:18.84]I'm so lost.
[181:27.46]I don't know.
[181:28.08]Is this something?
[181:29.12]Okay, I need a mod.
[181:32.04]Mod!
[181:35.13]Maude, what's happening right now?
[181:38.59]What is- What's happening right now?
[181:40.07]Why is this happening?
[181:48.39]Did something happen?
[181:50.21]I can't explain it.
[181:51.55]It's like I- Don't tell- Tell- You're telling me!
[182:00.65]I need to know.
[182:01.71]I want a Maude to tell me what's going on.
[182:09.15]Chat is just super bored.
[182:10.73]There's nothing.
[182:17.05]The game is boring.
[182:18.66]The stream is boring.
[182:19.62]Ugh.
[182:38.27]There's no way Lavo could be worse than this.
[182:41.53]I am trying to enlighten your minds, okay?
[182:45.39]Listen to me.
[182:47.39]We would play a lot of wacky, fucking weird, goofy, drive the car into the wall games here.
[182:53.28]I'm trying to get you, your intelligence, your brain moving today.
[183:01.28]I'm trying to get you...
[183:02.85]to sit and think, and relax, and maybe look, oh wait a minute, what is this game?
[183:09.01]Picross?
[183:10.19]Okay, I'm seeing what he's doing here, I'm following along, I'm gonna try this.
[183:15.49]And then I'm the reason, I'm the reason why you did better on your math test in like two weeks.
[183:20.54]And I want you to write at the top of that paper, you can write your name, I would put my name in there too at the top.
[183:26.52]Let's say your name is, uh, Greg Anderson.
[183:29.78]I want you to dash Jeremy Elbertson.
[183:31.92]Because I did it too.
[183:32.93]I helped you do that.
[183:43.33]Where are we?
[183:43.87]Two.
[183:49.08]Pause the stream.
[183:49.60]I need to go get a Band-Aid.
[183:52.46]What happened?
[183:53.96]What happened?
[183:54.44]What do you mean you have to get a bandaid?
[183:55.48]That's not enough information.
[183:56.46]What happened?
[184:06.77]Call an ambulance.
[184:12.92]No, he probably, like, just cut his finger on, like, a toy.
[184:17.05]Now, what kind of toy would that be if you could cut your finger on a toy?
[184:20.59]That thing would get recalled.
[184:22.11]Is it a toy?
[184:23.95]Do we need to get a recall?
[184:29.90]He stepped on a Lego and it went through his foot.
[184:32.72]It's embedded into him.
[184:35.78]Alright, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, that's not enough.
[184:47.93]ResidentSleeper.
[184:48.91]ResidentSleeper.
[184:56.62]ResidentSleeper is seriously, like, so offensive to every stream.
[185:01.94]Any stream.
[185:02.54]Think about how, like, I want you to think about this for a second before we go any further.
[185:06.37]Like, Failfish?
[185:07.97]Whatever, like, he sucks at the game.
[185:10.39]Like, oh, haha.
[185:11.63]Oh, he made, like, a dumb joke and I didn't think it was funny.
[185:13.81]He's like, yeah, I was cringey.
[185:15.83]ResidentSleeper means, this is so bad, I'm falling asleep because this is so boring to me that I can't stand it anymore.
[185:27.44]At least you're paying attention when you write some of the other ones.
[185:31.39]ResidentSleeper is like, holy shit, this sucks so bad that I'm going to bed.
[185:36.21]Good night.
[185:36.75]I'm not even watching anymore.
[185:46.07]And it's in my title.
[185:47.17]Yeah, alright.
[185:47.85]It's fine.
[185:48.17]Alright, I got one.
[185:55.85]Four, two, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[186:01.52]I don't know.
[186:03.08]I don't know where to start with this one.
[186:09.72]I don't have much to go on here.
[186:11.22]This is better than the wow stream?
[186:18.61]The wow stream was the lowest point.
[186:21.35]of my entire life that that single wow stream was the lowest single point in the history of my entire adult life what you guys know is when that stream turned off I smashed everything in my desk I broke every monitor I broke all the controllers in here I broke all the glass I put holes in all it was like a sixteen thousand dollar repair job you guys don't know that that happened
[186:54.05]I don't know where this next one goes, so that's why I'm stalling.
[187:02.63]What will you do after this stream?
[187:03.99]Nothing, because I'm having... This is... The WoW stream was fine.
[187:07.28]There was nothing wrong with the WoW stream.
[187:08.70]It was fun.
[187:12.70]Where does one of these go?
[187:13.66]I've got only one piece of info here.
[187:15.64]One, one.
[187:16.54]I guess this could be one.
[187:19.08]It has to be.
[187:19.58]So this is one of the ones.
[187:21.49]Also one of the ones.
[187:24.01]Two.
[187:24.37]Oh, I don't know if it's one of the ones.
[187:33.08]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[187:37.92]It's not enough to fill.
[187:39.96]One, two, three, four.
[187:42.10]One.
[187:43.54]No, I guess it could be.
[187:45.40]But I don't know that, though.
[187:47.50]Because it might not be there.
[187:49.42]It's either like that or it's like this.
[187:53.47]I don't have the data.
[187:55.16]I can do this though.
[188:02.14]I started drinking in hopes of finding something humor in this stream.
[188:24.43]Okay, so this is two somewhere, so I can go like this.
[188:28.57]Because it has to be somewhere in here.
[188:31.63]Same thing with this one.
[188:32.55]It has to be one of these two, so I can go like this.
[188:34.38]Okay.
[188:40.68]Go back to Floygan Brothers.
[188:42.32]I blended that disc up and stirred it up with my coffee and drank it.
[188:49.90]It was the most painful shit I've ever had in my life.
[188:57.03]Why did I say that?
[188:59.54]I don't know.
[189:04.12]Okay, one, two, three.
[189:05.88]One, two, three.
[189:06.78]Is it gonna be right here?
[189:14.65]One, and then one, two, three.
[189:18.03]It's gotta be one, or one.

[193:03.29]When did I promise Resident Evil?
[193:05.64]Space Channel 5 was almost about to happen today.
[193:08.24]Space Channel 5 and Seaman were going to be today.
[193:11.94]They were on the options list.
[193:18.87]This was pre-streamed.
[193:20.39]Democracy voted for this.
[193:23.35]Just to hang out and play Picross.
[193:27.47]Dusk was on here.
[193:29.59]ToeJam & Earl remake was on here.
[193:33.57]I just had a vote.
[193:37.73]That's what happened.
[193:42.27]There was like 300 or 400 responses.
[193:52.43]You're shifting the blame.
[193:53.63]What do you mean blame?
[193:57.05]This is fun.
[194:00.35]This is fun.
[194:02.03]And yes, I'm going to keep saying that until it's true.
[194:06.90]It is true.

[195:08.96]Hold on.
[195:10.06]Here, you guys can play this one while I think about this.

[195:27.34]I woke up.
[195:30.00]I had some B vitamins.

[195:38.08]Um... What the fuck did I have for food?
[195:53.17]It's really not that hard.
[195:54.13]This is not hard to determine.

[196:53.14]Chicken.
[196:54.82]Maybe.
[197:03.53]Is it chicken?

[197:12.34]I'm calling Kim right now.
[197:22.00]I had vitamin B. I think it was re- it was heated up in the microwave.
[197:28.75]It was reheated.

[199:04.25]It was chicken, something chicken.
[199:07.82]Oh, I know what it was.
[199:09.84]Got it.
[199:11.27]It was a frozen dinner.
[199:15.07]It was a chicken curry frozen dinner.
[199:19.41]That's what it was.
[199:20.33]I win.
[199:26.95]Alright, let's play.
[199:31.71]No wonder I'm so sad.
[199:34.39]You guessed curry.
[199:35.14]Holy shit.
[199:35.54]Yeah, good work.
[199:38.45]Was it still frozen when you ate it?
[199:39.77]Yeah, I just, I took a fork and a hammer and I like... And I chipped off like a big chunk of the chicken and I just like put it in my mouth and I let it sit in there.
[199:51.57]Cold, frozen.
[199:53.03]Until the 98.6 degrees temperature of Fahrenheit in my mouth warmed it up to a point where I could swallow it.
[200:02.05]And I could kind of like mash it and mush it around in my mouth a little bit.
[200:15.82]Dance game.
[200:16.94]Dance game.
[200:24.60]What kind of curry was it?
[200:25.44]It was a chicken curry, I don't know.
[200:30.32]98.6 degrees in mouth, that's not natural.
[200:32.28]Fahrenheit, yes it is.
[200:33.08]97.5 to like 99 is normal.
[200:44.13]Jerma 98.6.
[200:44.51]Okay, okay, okay, okay, here, here, here.
[200:49.57]Five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[200:51.27]I don't have info.
[200:53.41]I don't have any fucking info.
[201:01.32]One.
[201:01.48]I have this.
[201:14.99]I don't have any info for this.
[201:17.17]I just don't.
[201:19.69]I could try to determine this.
[201:21.25]So let's run two, three.
[201:23.27]One, two, three, four, five.
[201:24.71]It's one off.
[201:26.92]One, two, three, four, five.
[201:31.38]It's probably in here.
[201:32.18]Let's see.
[201:32.58]One, two, three, or one, two, three.
[201:35.66]One, two, three.
[201:38.70]I think I got the three.
[201:47.89]You know, for the longest time, I thought that that emote, the Vinny's Zelda emote, I thought it was somebody throwing up into their hand.
[202:00.40]And then I was like, oh no, that's from that cartoon.
[202:09.53]That's from the Philip CDI game, right?
[202:19.83]Alright, hold on.
[202:21.43]No, that's not Kim texting you back.
[202:23.65]That's like... That's like my fucking... Never mind.
[202:30.98]Somebody help me here.
[202:38.72]You're so bored you're looking for emotes for fun.
[202:40.60]I am not bored.
[202:41.54]I'm just stuck.
[202:47.66]I'm just stuck.
[202:54.00]One, two, three, four, five.
[202:57.92]One, two, three, I guess it could be here in... Seven.
[203:03.12]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[203:05.39]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[203:08.77]Three, five.
[203:11.25]Two.
[203:13.17]Three.
[203:16.69]Dammit.
[203:22.68]Ugh.
[203:32.36]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[203:35.41]One.
[203:37.09]Could be anywhere over here.
[203:40.17]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[203:42.71]It could be anywhere.
[203:43.47]The one could be literally any of these.
[203:45.97]Because this is three, and this is also three, so it could be either one.
[204:01.59]Yeah, the one can only be here the question is it's I can't I can't determine which one it is So therefore one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven Doesn't really help me though Fill in most of the stuff I'm doing it.
[204:26.67]Oh
[204:37.54]Play English lessons.
[204:39.39]No.
[204:40.51]No.
[204:41.49]No.
[204:42.43]Can I teach you how to play the game?
[204:43.43]Yeah.
[204:43.63]3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A, 3, 5, 3, 10, 1, 7, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1.
[204:45.67]It's that simple.
[204:46.15]I have to start guessing.
[205:06.50]The stream is just looping back on itself.
[205:14.66]Oh, hey!
[205:15.85]How's it going?
[205:17.77]How you doing?
[205:18.35]Welcome to the stream.
[205:22.55]Alright, so we got one, two, three, or one, two, three, therefore, goodbye.
[205:28.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[205:34.62]Because it has to be either 1, 2, 3, or 1, 2, 3.
[205:37.38]Therefore, I think it's impossible.
[205:40.50]Same on this side.
[205:41.30]Because there's no way this 3 can come up this way.
[205:47.94]It's either here, here, or here.
[205:51.02]I don't have info for down here yet.
[206:00.14]Brown car note.
[206:12.32]Is he finally using crosses?
[206:13.66]I've been using crosses the whole time!
[206:17.12]What?
[206:17.36]I've been using these the entire time!
[206:22.40]Almost four hours of ResidentSleeper.
[206:24.34]It doesn't even feel like it's been... By the way, three and a half.
[206:27.87]You're adding time.
[206:29.37]You're adding like 40 minutes of time to make it seem like it's been more boring, but it's only been three hours and 27 minutes.
[206:36.29]Three hours and 10 minutes probably in the game.
[206:39.01]You added an extra 45 minutes.
[206:41.07]How is that fair?
[206:48.04]It's called rounding up three hours and 27 minutes.
[206:51.18]You round that up to four?
[206:54.00]No, you round that down to three.
[206:56.40]Three hours and 31 minutes round up.
[207:02.55]The music is bad.
[207:03.39]I'll change the music.
[207:04.49]Will that make you guys happy?
[207:10.23]The music is kind of bad.
[207:15.78]Round to the nearest hour.
[207:22.50]Okay, how about... I'm not going to play the brown note.
[207:30.32]Look, this thing says warning the real brown note, brown frequency.
[207:35.70]By the way, it's by the YouTube channel Apex Legends Clips.
[207:40.67]What?
[207:56.12]play this okay I did it I don't feel good I feel like I don't feel very good
[208:15.51]Alright, WARNING!
[208:16.75]Warning, here's a warning for everybody, okay?
[208:18.73]I want to make sure I make this really clear.
[208:20.77]I'm about to play a low frequency sound that might cause you pain or a headache.
[208:27.48]Why the fuck would I play this?
[208:29.52]I'm, okay, here's the warning.
[208:31.66]If you don't want to hear this, I'm going to put it at a reasonable level.
[208:38.26]Here it comes, okay?
[208:39.94]I'm gonna tell you right now, if you don't, I'm giving you a fair warning, please.
[208:42.76]It's gonna be a low sounding frequency noise.
[208:45.42]I would mute the stream for the next 30 seconds, okay?
[208:50.67]Mute now.
[208:52.29]Wanna make sure you have enough warning.
[208:53.77]Here we go.
[209:06.29]That's just a THX sound.
[209:27.53]Thank you.
[209:57.84]Wait, that's the PlayStation 1 startup sound?
[210:03.12]No, it's not.
[210:05.08]Don't tell me that.
[210:10.07]No, wait, wait, wait.
[210:28.78]Let's see.
[210:53.65]Oh, that explains.
[210:54.89]Somebody said that explains why every time I turned off my PS1, I had to use the bathroom.
[211:09.74]Okay, you can unmute.
[211:13.00]That's the regular show intro?
[211:17.65]They had an intro?
[211:31.79]Man, this is some... This is some, like, deep fucking conspiracy bullshit.
[211:38.39]Are they trying to control us with this noise?
[211:46.79]How often does that happen?
[211:58.46]Ugh.
[211:59.97]Oh, there you go.
[212:01.13]I did the three brown notes.
[212:06.28]Hopefully you guys aren't fucking throwing up or anything.
[212:09.14]I feel worse now.
[212:12.08]I'm not kidding.
[212:12.56]I'm serious.
[212:15.29]I actually feel bad.
[212:16.51]I feel not... I don't... I feel worse.
[212:22.01]Now, I'm not doing the 17 hertz anxiety tone.
[212:41.08]It might have something to do with the frozen dinner you ate.
[212:44.66]Nah, it was the frequency that's making me have an upset stomach.
[212:49.48]Okay, let's get back into this.
[212:59.19]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[213:00.87]How many times is he gonna say okay today?
[213:02.77]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[213:06.65]One, two, three, one.
[213:10.87]I gotta put some music on or something.
[213:12.41]Something.
[213:12.77]Anything.
[213:16.41]Uh... How about something smooth?
[213:24.94]Smooth jazz.
[213:26.82]Royalty free.
[213:28.80]That's good, right?
[213:32.59]Smooth jazz, royalty free music.
[213:47.26]Did I just really get the pirate thing?
[213:56.26]Okay.
[214:00.52]Preview.
[214:01.18]I can't focus.
[214:09.21]I can't focus anymore since the placebo effect of the brown note.
[214:15.66]It actually took over my brain.
[214:20.37]Ugh, alright, five.
[214:24.09]There's no way to tell where these are.
[214:27.57]Three, five, five, three, it could be one, two, three.
[214:33.73]One, two, three, or one, two, three, fuck.
[214:42.36]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[214:47.09]I have to take a guess.
[214:48.45]One, two, three.
[214:49.40]One, two, three.
[214:51.40]One, two, three, four, five.
[214:53.54]One, two, three, four, five.
[214:56.24]Hold on a second here though.
[214:57.28]One, two, three.
[214:59.68]One, two, three, four, fuck.
[215:13.57]So 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, it can't be here.
[215:16.11]1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, can't be here.
[215:17.13]Okay, okay, okay, hold on.
[215:19.05]1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, it can't be there.
[215:20.17]Narrowed it down.
[215:23.30]1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, bingo!
[215:24.86]3, 3!
[215:42.01]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[215:45.72]One.
[215:47.32]Nice, okay.
[215:48.76]I swear to God, I feel fucking terrible.
[215:55.24]It affected me.
[216:05.03]I'm never doing that again.
[216:05.97]I'm never playing any fucked up song again.
[216:10.92]Let's see.
[216:24.55]I wish I had any information here.
[216:25.80]3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[216:28.26]It could be 1, 2, 3.
[216:28.78]It can't be this one.
[216:29.88]That's 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[216:30.52]So this one has to be correct, which gets us to 5.
[216:37.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[216:38.04]And then not yet.
[216:55.35]Please listen to Minecraft cat?
[217:08.12]What the fuck?
[217:08.68]Why would I put this on?
[217:09.79]Minecraft cat.
[217:15.79]Minecraft 25 things you didn't know about the cat.
[217:23.76]Minecraft music cat.
[217:27.09]Is this a fucking hidden brown nose here?
[217:29.21]It better not be.
[217:33.77]That already made me feel terrible.
[217:41.94]I'm gonna get fucking... I can already tell it's gonna happen.
[217:54.26]This is good.
[217:55.15]This is just like weird clown music.
[217:57.53]This is scary horror movie clown music No, that's a little bit better Alright, so we've got five here
[218:16.69]One, two, three.
[218:17.41]Could be there.
[218:17.81]No, I don't know if this is the... This is probably the one.
[218:20.80]No, hold on.
[218:22.16]One.
[218:23.16]This could be part of the three.
[218:24.18]Yeah, it has to be the three, doesn't it?
[218:38.51]One, two, three.
[218:39.73]Yeah, it has to be the three.

[221:15.29]I still won the 10x10.
[221:24.98]Let's see, eight.
[221:29.37]My guess from an hour ago didn't count.
[221:31.25]Yeah, this is, this is also dog shit.
[221:42.75]Sea, what is Sea Shanties?
[221:45.86]Why is, why does everyone want me to do Sea Shanty 2?
[222:00.94]This is like Yoshi music Alright, can we get something else besides like the mouse circus?
[222:09.32]No, I'm just kidding it's fine

[222:40.87]Oh, this is from RuneScape!
[222:45.08]RuneScape!
[222:46.68]I didn't know that.
[222:53.60]That's a classic video game.
[222:58.74]Okay, eight.
[223:08.33]Play the shepherd tone.
[223:09.73]I'm not gonna play any more weird tones, they make me feel sick.
[223:16.69]This is more guessing here.
[223:17.73]One, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[223:21.37]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[223:23.21]It's gonna be rough, I have to guess these.
[223:32.86]Shepherd tone, shepherd tone, shepherd tone, shepherd tone.
[223:38.15]What is this?
[223:40.89]Shepard Tone is an audio illusion which seems to get forever higher.
[223:44.45]I don't want to... Okay.
[223:50.01]It's an audio illusion which seems to get forever higher but never really does.
[223:59.54]Should I do this?
[224:00.08]Alright, I'm going to give you a warning.
[224:02.18]If you're sensitive to audio-visual noises and shit, just be careful.
[224:09.64]I'm going to give you a little warning here.
[224:27.47]That is getting higher.
[224:28.33]What do you mean that's not getting higher?
[224:31.73]This is so obviously getting higher.
[224:38.96]Turn it off.
[224:42.68]Turn it off.
[224:43.24]This is five minutes long.
[224:46.28]We're not even 30 seconds in.
[224:54.32]Ow!
[225:00.83]What?
[225:45.26]It just reset.
[225:50.96]It's going up.
[225:57.16]It's going up.
[226:02.10]No, no, no.
[226:02.65]It's back here.
[226:03.13]It's back here.
[226:13.41]It's back down.
[226:37.27]Play sorting algorithms.
[226:42.45]I've heard these before.
[226:43.25]These are the ones that are like...
[226:48.75]I'm not doing these, fuck that.
[226:55.90]This is just- I'm gonna give everybody a headache.
[227:14.85]This is Space Invaders on 400x speed.
[227:20.31]That's what this is.
[228:09.78]okay that was fun show us show us show us show us what is what is there to show it's lines that go all over the place and they scream at you there's not much else to show you there
[228:25.83]I have ultra-bustache hair today.
[228:30.75]Why do I only have one earbud in?
[228:33.35]Because I'm fucked.
[228:45.95]No, now the fucking sorting thing got me messed up.
[228:56.09]Okay.
[228:59.75]He has cooked his brain.
[229:02.23]Click it.
[229:03.03]I'm turning my headphones off when I click this.
[229:16.06]Why on Earth would I play this right now?
[229:18.16]This is from Joe's Bizarre Adventure.
[229:22.38]What...
[229:31.33]There's just no reason for that to be played.
[229:33.87]Not at this note of zero.
[229:41.57]I mean, that's a song that's part of the JoJo's universe.
[229:45.44]You know, Steven's universe, whatever it's called.
[229:54.20]JoJo and Steven go on a bizarre adventure in their universe.
[230:05.92]Steven's Bizarre Adventure.
[230:16.24]I've actually never seen an episode of Steven's Universe.
[230:27.17]I've never seen it.
[230:31.65]I can't believe he's still on this level, because we had to take a break.
[230:47.06]Okay.
[230:48.90]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[230:52.84]And one, and then a space, and a do, and a three, and a one, and a two.
[231:01.36]I'm extremely stressed now.
[231:03.16]What?
[231:03.42]Why?
[231:10.47]Do dial-up noises.
[231:11.87]Why are you guys trying to, like, make me, like, my brain exhausted?
[231:22.44]I'm gonna guess that that's a one.
[231:27.40]Hey, I got an idea.
[231:28.64]You know the really, really grating, awful, like burn your head sound?
[231:32.55]Play that.
[231:33.61]Just play it.
[231:36.01]Crazy Frog.
[231:36.69]I did Crazy Frog in Beat Saber and 100% expert at the level.
[231:53.69]Fill in the middle two rows with six.
[231:55.19]Yeah, but I don't know which way they go.
[231:59.57]I could do like, let's say one, two, three, four for now.
[232:02.80]One, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[232:07.28]Let's just say there's a one here.
[232:09.08]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[232:12.60]You just assume, you know, you assume the dealer has a face card, right?
[232:16.32]So one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[232:22.18]Do the same thing over here.
[232:27.37]There's the two.
[232:30.61]Don't have the three though.
[232:36.69]Play English lessons?
[232:37.67]No.
[232:41.89]Ram Ranch's Zoomer humor.
[232:46.45]I don't know what that is.
[232:55.44]One, where's the one?
[232:58.62]Three.
[233:03.10]Interesting.
[233:07.32]Well, here's the thing.
[233:08.85]Now I can't just delete because there's a one here.
[233:14.59]Well, I can do this.
[233:15.37]Because that much is certain.
[233:20.88]Nothing else is.
[233:23.78]Nothing is certain.
[233:25.32]Nothing is... Nothing is... Nothing is certain.
[233:29.67]Nothing is certain.
[233:32.43]Why is that happening?
[233:33.07]Nothing is cert... Nothing is... My syllabus is fucking crazy today.
[233:42.63]Well, two is definitely not these two.
[233:51.12]One...
[233:52.82]And then maybe two down here.
[233:54.06]It has to be one of these.
[234:04.54]Put on You Say Run.

[248:17.81]One, one, one, one, one.
[248:20.19]Okay.
[248:28.72]Can you select a bigger board?
[248:29.98]I'm surprised we haven't seen any 15 or 20 by 20.
[248:35.29]I'll go back to the menu and see if we can get, like, a big one.
[248:37.43]And then we can all do a huge one together.
[248:41.05]Here he comes.
[248:41.73]Here he comes.
[248:43.61]No.
[248:44.95]Decided against it today.
[248:49.09]Wait.
[248:52.64]Don't ever underestimate the power of the rumor.
[248:59.06]So we've got five goes in the middle here somewhere.
[249:02.38]One, two, three, four, five.
[249:04.35]One, two, three, four, five.
[249:06.05]Kind of has to be one of these.
[249:11.45]Maybe not all the way though.
[249:13.47]One, two, three, four, five.
[249:15.73]One, two, three, four, five.
[249:19.41]I can't be certain.
[249:27.48]Can't be certain, don't guess.
[249:39.22]one two three four five one two three four five one two three four five I think that it works
[250:13.80]Re, e8, re, e8, re, e8, re.

[250:44.06]everybody calm down I'm just trying
[251:07.84]I'm trying to relate to the younger crowd.
[251:09.94]I'm trying to relate to the younger audience.
[251:11.60]That's like a re is cool, right?
[251:13.98]I don't know.
[251:14.48]I just installed BTTV six days ago.
[251:18.72]I don't know what that means.
[251:20.36]Okay, one can't be there.
[251:39.31]Mmm, this one's done.
[251:40.17]Nice relaxing stream.
[251:52.78]People to come here and just chill and relax and you just fucking read in their ears.
[251:56.74]I know.
[252:01.09]I know.
[252:01.95]I did.
[252:11.11]Only one more.
[252:30.40]Apologize?
[252:31.10]I'm sorry, I thought I'm sorry.
[252:38.58]I think that would, I think that works.
[252:41.56]One, two, three, four, five.
[252:43.30]One, two, three, four, yeah it does.
[252:45.06]I don't know if this is the first one or the second one.
[253:00.22]I don't know if this is because this could be one let's see could it be one one two three four five no this has to be part of the five so this has to be one right here it has to be right because there's no way that that can be the one one two three four five that should be good
[253:30.66]One.
[253:30.96]This is also one.
[253:34.82]There it is.
[253:35.26]Okay.
[253:38.72]Looking for a two.
[253:42.63]I fucking hate this stream.
[253:44.07]Why?
[253:44.55]What?
[253:47.29]I told you guys I was gonna have just a relaxed hangout stream.
[253:52.69]Don't hate me.
[253:54.33]I don't want you to hate me.
[253:55.48]Don't hate me.
[253:58.02]We're just having a chill hangout stream.
[254:13.61]Well, this could be one is this this is probably it right here No, I don't know that it We're just hanging out No pressure, you know, just there's no pressure here we just have enough good time as a fucking community, okay, so
[254:42.08]There, I could pay attention.
[254:42.88]That's 1, 1.
[254:52.38]This would make sense in either one of these two spaces, so I don't know.
[254:54.90]Let's see.
[255:05.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[255:06.40]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

[255:52.50]There's the one.
[255:53.12]There's the last one.
[255:57.13]And then here's eight.
[255:58.53]Eight and eight.
[255:59.01]There it is.
[255:59.35]What is this?
[256:02.81]Lettuce?
[256:05.73]Garden boots.
[256:09.45]Four people got that correct somehow.
[256:12.94]You garden boots?
[256:14.88]Oh, you probably beat it.
[256:15.78]You probably played this level.
[256:21.78]And you're like, yeah, I got to this part before I know what it is.
[256:26.11]You're too slow.
[256:29.91]Yeah, but okay, the people that got past me garden boots, they didn't sit here for like 20, 30 straight minutes talking about like what I ate for dinner last night and like put on fucking Ram Ranch.
[256:45.25]Alright, let's go do a hard one.
[256:46.75]Let's go to the menu.

[256:56.54]Alright, let's do 20 to 20.
[256:58.42]20 by 20.
[256:58.54]They're locked.
[256:59.12]Wait.
[257:12.50]Okay.
[257:13.50]I don't want to know what these are.
[257:14.46]Alright, here's the 15x15.
[257:16.44]We can't do 20x20.
[257:17.42]We have to... Fuck that guy.
[257:25.63]I swear.
[257:26.25]Okay, we'll do accessories.
[257:33.65]15x15.
[257:37.09]But this one's, or what?
[257:38.21]I don't know.
[257:38.71]Come on.
[257:39.39]You don't give that to me.
[257:40.40]This is like 10 by 10.
[257:41.66]You took it away from me.
[257:42.56]It's the most exciting thing to happen in hours.
[257:47.66]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[257:48.16]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[257:48.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[257:48.56]Okay.
[257:48.88]We're not going for excitement.
[257:50.54]We're going for ingenuity.
[258:08.55]How the fuck am I going to do this one?
[258:11.31]Four, five, six, seven.
[258:17.91]Let us do one.
[258:18.61]I almost said the re word.
[258:21.17]Re.
[258:22.19]God.
[258:25.79]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[258:27.87]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[258:30.67]Two, three, four, five, six.
[258:32.39]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[258:36.44]Okay, I've got two here.
[258:41.14]Now, five, one, two, three, four, five.
[258:44.11]Get out of here.
[258:44.77]Look at that.
[258:46.13]Ooh, feels good.
[258:52.93]Four could be right here.
[258:59.19]Four, two, seven, right in the middle there.
[259:03.01]Okay.
[259:07.71]Okay.
[259:09.01]Is this Minesweeper?
[259:10.71]Not quite.
[259:14.75]Six, let's see.
[259:18.91]One, two, three, four, five.
[259:20.88]Nope, one, two, three, four, five.
[259:23.46]It's probably one of these two.
[259:34.46]3, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, so this is all bullshit.
[259:36.90]Same with this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, so this is all bullshit up here.
[259:41.35]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all bullshit.
[260:00.94]No wait, one, two, three, four, five.
[260:03.84]One, two, three, four, five.
[260:05.44]What's wrong with my voice?
[260:06.16]Okay.
[260:17.09]Three going up and down, three going up and down again, but I don't know if it's connected to here.
[260:21.37]It might be.
[260:22.53]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[260:27.43]I don't, I can't tell.
[260:32.58]Sixes, though.
[260:33.70]It's possible.
[260:36.04]One, two, three, four.
[260:38.54]One, two, three, four.
[260:39.98]Therefore, all this is dog shit.
[260:44.76]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[260:47.79]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[260:50.09]All this is dog shit.
[260:59.99]Jerma sucks.
[261:03.22]Well, everybody's got an opinion, you know.
[261:10.24]4, 2.
[261:10.36]I can't tell.
[261:12.72]Don't have any info yet.
[261:15.30]2 and then 2.
[261:23.67]Let's think about this for a second.
[261:28.28]5.
[261:28.30]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[261:29.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[261:29.20]That's right.
[261:30.20]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[261:31.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[261:31.20]That's correct.
[261:33.14]Then here's the real issue.
[261:34.30]Is this part of the 4?
[261:35.22]Or is this 4 and this 2?
[261:35.93]I don't know.
[261:36.45]Hmm.
[261:57.81]One, two, three.
[261:58.85]One, two, three.
[262:03.15]One, two, three, four.
[262:04.71]One, two, three, four.
[262:09.17]Okay.
[262:10.03]Is that part of the four, or is this four, too?
[262:13.61]I don't know.
[262:19.79]You should try the quit puzzle game.
[262:23.39]I'm not going to do that.
[262:23.97]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[262:24.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[262:24.69]That makes sense.
[262:25.31]Which means 3, 4.
[262:26.79]1, 2, 3, 4.
[262:26.89]1, 2, 3, 4.
[262:26.99]1, 2, 3, 4.
[262:27.17]1, 2, 3, 4.
[262:27.29]It's not there.
[262:57.72]Damn it.
[262:58.42]One, two, three.
[263:00.08]One, two, three.
[263:00.76]It's not here.
[263:03.54]One, two, three.
[263:04.42]One... Okay.
[263:14.91]Nice.
[263:18.23]One, two, three, seven.
[263:22.72]There's the six.
[263:25.57]six again okay there's the four the two oh it just cascades like a domino that's what you say chill out dude it's an accessory you guys are guessing animals it's not it's not a this is not a whale well it's got to be here or here therefore none of this works
[264:01.41]1, 2, 3, 4.
[264:02.01]1, 2, 3, 4.
[264:02.75]1, 2, 3, 4.
[264:03.07]1, 2, 3, 4.
[264:07.43]That's it for 3.
[264:14.66]I don't like men under 5 feet.
[264:16.28]Sorry, Willis.
[264:16.80]That's great because I'm 5'8".
[264:18.20]No, that's not true.
[264:21.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[264:22.00]I'm talking about like this.
[264:22.94]That's not real.
[264:24.18]This is not going to work.
[264:27.71]Men under 5 feet.
[264:45.17]One, two, three.
[264:46.79]One, two, three.
[264:47.69]It can't be here.
[264:48.40]Oh, there's the two.
[264:54.40]I'm going to guess I think this is a pipe.
[264:57.88]A smoking pipe.
[265:00.39]Dremel only reads mean comments so we feel bad and give him money.
[265:08.95]One, two, three.
[265:09.79]One, two, three.
[265:10.47]Can't be here.
[265:13.91]Where's this two?
[265:23.19]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[265:25.17]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[265:27.29]Perfect.
[265:27.69]Nice.
[265:30.11]okay one two three four three excellent two two three two three I told you it was a pipe oh my god a cheeto
[266:03.61]Okay, remember, this is 15 by 15.
[266:05.51]10 doesn't do anything for us anymore.
[266:14.87]So we can do 12, 13, so it's like this.
[266:17.79]Because that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[266:19.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[266:20.03]Ooh, wait a second.
[266:20.83]No, that's fine.
[266:31.05]Because that's 12, 13, 14, 15.
[266:32.69]I guess it could be either way.
[266:33.79]Yes, it does, you buffoon.
[266:44.48]Yeah, still not a real board.
[266:45.72]Yeah, they're giving us like the slow drip here.
[266:50.90]Therefore, 10 would be, how many down is this?
[266:52.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[266:52.72]Okay, so the middle 10 here, so that would be like in here.
[266:55.08]Let's see.
[266:55.54]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[266:55.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[266:56.02]Same deal here.
[266:57.14]8, 9, 10.
[266:57.22]Can't really do much with that, but we do know this is 8.
[267:24.87]Why wouldn't they fill this one in?
[267:26.75]They filled all the other ones in.
[267:27.79]Why not this one?
[267:30.73]Well, that just made everything way easier.
[267:33.02]Because now I can go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[267:34.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[267:34.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[267:35.20]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[267:35.56]So that can't be that.
[267:36.34]Can't be over here.
[267:51.72]Actually, none of these can be over here.
[267:53.23]Wait.
[267:53.77]Yeah.
[267:56.05]One could still be here.
[268:00.21]That one could be right here.
[268:01.33]It probably is.
[268:09.06]Let's see.
[268:09.82]Six.
[268:10.46]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[268:13.70]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[268:21.02]That's reaching.
[268:22.48]I don't know if that's true or not.
[268:23.52]It's reaching.
[268:23.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[268:27.10]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[268:27.44]Alright.
[268:27.78]There's the 10.
[268:28.38]There's the 10.
[268:28.84]Close that.
[268:30.04]Looks pretty good.
[268:30.88]Now we got 12.
[268:31.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[268:32.32]Still don't know.
[268:51.77]Do something funny.
[268:56.71]No, let me do something funny.
[268:58.07]Let me talk about it.
[268:59.16]One, two, three, four.
[269:00.86]One, two, three, four.
[269:01.86]These two.
[269:05.26]That's the two there.
[269:06.04]Here's the three.
[269:11.18]There's your six.
[269:15.56]Make do funny.
[269:16.20]Funny.
[269:16.40]Something funny.
[269:19.06]It's not all about fun and games.
[269:21.68]It's not all about funny.
[269:23.40]Sometimes it's about just relaxing.
[269:27.09]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[269:34.03]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[269:37.33]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[269:40.52]So there you go.
[269:44.66]I want a joke.
[269:45.66]I want a joke.
[269:49.16]There are no jokes.
[269:57.35]Let me see what we got here.
[270:02.63]One, two, three, four.
[270:08.45]The ones are going to be tricky.
[270:12.88]The brown note sapped him of all his funny.
[270:17.82]I'm not sapped.
[270:20.32]I'm just having a good time.
[270:22.44]That's all that I meant.
[270:23.64]That, you know.
[270:27.41]Well, it's very clear that 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, so this is nothing.
[270:30.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, so these are, it's middle here, so it has to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5.
[270:35.36]Excellent.
[270:35.56]Excellent.
[270:55.11]I jump into my favorite streamer's stream after a long day at work, extremely tired to see him playing a Boomer game.
[271:00.01]Also, why wasn't Saturn on the t-shirt?
[271:02.81]Care to explain?
[271:05.38]Because they're standing on Saturn.
[271:08.66]But how do I need to explain that?
[271:21.67]By the way, if you don't know, I have merchandise.
[271:24.42]T-shirts.
[271:26.98]30 days old, just about.
[271:28.54]The Night Sky t-shirt and Gloom Man animated return.
[271:30.74]If you do hashtag shirts, you're gonna find the store.
[271:37.49]And maybe you'll buy one if you want.
[271:40.85]There's no reason to unless you want the shirt and want to be involved in the cool shirt club.
[271:46.69]Alright, hold on.
[271:48.25]What is this?
[271:48.97]Can't be there.
[271:52.01]One, two, three, four...
[271:54.88]Can't be here, and it can't be here.
[272:00.32]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[272:03.04]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[272:05.36]Cool, there's the one, excellent.
[272:08.45]Narrowed it down in here too.
[272:09.63]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[272:11.43]One, two, three, four, five, six, nice.
[272:16.61]Did that give me anything else?
[272:17.41]That gave me the three.
[272:22.11]That means nothing over there.
[272:27.23]Hmm, nothing over here.
[272:31.07]There it is.
[272:31.43]I still don't know about that.
[272:40.12]I do know that though.
[272:47.69]Okay, so that's close enough.
[272:50.29]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[272:55.95]I guess it could be either one of these.
[272:57.11]Yeah, could be.
[273:05.15]Alright.
[273:06.04]Almost done with this one.
[273:07.02]Holy shit, he clicked on that white box?
[273:13.38]Yep.
[273:20.64]No, no, no, no, no.
[273:21.24]There's still one here.
[273:23.22]It's either this one or this one.
[273:26.16]How the hell would I know?
[273:27.12]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1.
[273:31.78]No, that's not true.
[273:32.52]I got the 8.
[273:33.18]How about the 12?
[273:55.31]8-1... 8-1... Possible.
[273:59.71]Mmm, I don't like that.
[274:06.27]I mean, it's gotta be here, right?
[274:08.00]There's... There has to be.
[274:10.76]Look at how perfect that is.
[274:17.00]I fucked up something?
[274:17.78]What did I fuck up?
[274:20.25]Row 5 is incorrect.
[274:21.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:22.80]Hold on.
[274:23.54]What do you mean I fucked it up?
[274:24.54]1, 2, 3, 4.
[274:31.66]Alright.
[274:52.27]six and then one two three four five six seven eight oh shit okay hold on one two three four five six seven eight that cleaned that up but is it right I think so yeah okay I got it does this has to be there one two three four twelve is done oh shit wait okay
[275:26.50]Uhhh... No!
[275:27.56]No!
[275:28.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[275:32.54]Because this is... Oh, shit.
[275:49.53]Six.
[275:50.81]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[275:54.88]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[275:59.03]And then one?
[275:59.59]That's correct though.
[276:20.34]One, two, three, four, five.
[276:28.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[276:35.87]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[276:39.16]No!
[276:39.50]No!
[276:40.14]No!
[276:40.90]I've... There's one fucked up block.
[276:45.06]Or two blocks that have screwed up.
[276:46.66]Hold on, remove these.
[276:49.34]Is this symmetrical here?
[276:59.70]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[277:00.91]That's done.
[277:02.63]Close that up.
[277:06.93]That looks correct.
[277:07.45]That'll be 4 and 4.
[277:07.95]2 and 2.
[277:11.97]1 and 1.
[277:12.37]1 and 1 again.
[277:12.73]Right?
[277:13.65]And then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[277:14.53]1.
[277:14.55]And then 1.
[277:30.05]one what this is correct though but what what's going on here here and here and here oh got it column g is completely wrong no it's not it's correct
[278:03.81]That was not auto.
[278:08.39]That's not even how moons work.
[278:10.66]Here's the best part.
[278:13.48]This is like peeling off a band-aid after it's been on there for like four days.
[278:22.39]Ugh.
[278:31.33]It's good.
[278:32.05]This whole column is gone.
[278:33.09]There's one, three going up.
[278:36.85]Five going up.
[278:37.47]One, two, three, five.
[278:40.49]Four there.
[278:41.11]That looks good.
[278:43.05]Four again.
[278:44.61]Five.
[278:46.83]Three.
[278:47.39]I love when you get these things for free.
[278:49.64]You get the whole entire bottom row for free.
[278:52.08]It feels amazing.
[278:56.24]So we got a lot to work with now.
[279:00.18]Actually, that took away like 40% of the whole board.
[279:03.30]Okay.
[279:07.08]So this is a lighting.
[279:09.66]Something to do with lighting.
[279:12.10]Any other places I didn't fill in?
[279:16.28]There's a two somewhere, there's a five, there's a six, there's a one, there's three.
[279:19.74]Oh, let's get the sixes.
[279:21.64]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[279:24.19]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[279:28.66]These are the same, right?
[279:29.52]Yep, they are.
[279:31.64]So that means we've got an eight in the middle, six in the middle.
[279:36.03]This is done.
[279:38.41]So is this one.
[279:42.23]I'm gonna assume the eight, look at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, perfect.
[279:46.09]It's gonna be the same thing, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[279:54.24]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[279:56.00]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[279:57.58]You could fill these in.
[279:58.52]That's the five right there.
[280:00.38]Thank you very much.
[280:01.42]Five and then three is filled in.
[280:03.92]Same deal on this side.
[280:04.66]What the hell is this?
[280:07.06]A lantern or something?
[280:11.56]Okay, so we got six.
[280:13.56]One, three.
[280:14.61]Three's there.
[280:16.13]Three's there again.
[280:18.65]That's done.
[280:22.99]6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.
[280:27.91]This one was done pretty quickly.
[280:29.27]2, 1.
[280:32.10]Oof.
[280:35.06]Anybody get it?
[280:38.24]Lantern, right?
[280:45.80]Congratulations.
[280:47.96]You guys did it.
[280:54.45]You guys wanna do one?
[280:57.67]You guys wanna do one?
[280:58.35]I think you guys deserve to do one.
[281:00.48]Let me, let me start, let me help you out here.
[281:01.80]Let's, let's get the easy shit done first.
[281:04.46]Like, the one column, you know what I mean?
[281:08.36]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, you guys got something to work with here.
[281:13.96]Uh, if, if you guys do, like, two full columns in a row, like, as, like, an L-U-L, laugh fucking out loud...
[281:21.58]Um... I'm not... Here's... I'm gonna tell you something.
[281:26.66]We're not stopping this game until you complete this.
[281:33.67]So... Better work together.
[281:47.95]Go on.
[281:54.69]Welcome to hell.
[282:02.60]Oh, look at that.
[282:05.32]By the way, I want to make this really, really clear.
[282:07.42]Until you guys beat this level, I am not going to stream another game.
[282:12.76]We're talking tomorrow.
[282:13.62]We're talking the next day.
[282:14.34]You're going to have to beat this level before I do another video game.
[282:18.22]How's that for a fucking little bit of encouragement?
[282:24.43]You beat this level, though, this is all I scream for the rest of my life.
[282:38.67]Okay, okay, test it.
[282:40.63]Go ahead, test it.
[282:43.61]Let's test it.
[282:51.50]Have your fun.
[282:58.55]Twitch plays Picross.
[283:01.37]Every day, until they get it right.
[283:11.04]Wait, you can do individual cells?
[283:12.67]Yes, you can.
[283:26.26]Yeah, look at that.
[283:27.80]Democracy wins.
[283:44.77]The never-ending stream.
[283:47.16]Well, I didn't say it was going to be on 24-7.
[283:51.26]I just said that when I turn it off, if you guys don't complete this, I'm going to turn it back on tomorrow and this is what we're starting with.
[284:06.76]It's actually kind of funny because the second I started talking about that, an absolute shitload of people in this chat was like, oh fuck, okay, no, no, no, let's get this done.
[284:15.76]I don't want to see this shit again.
[284:16.66]Anyway, you guys are doing like a little joke, filling in the squares, all, fill the whole thing in.
[284:22.62]Hey, this is all we're doing for the next week until you guys complete this.
[284:26.18]Oh fuck, okay, time to do like, time to get this done.
[284:28.48]We gotta actually do this now.
[284:30.04]I don't want to see this shit again, ever again.
[284:40.34]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[284:41.23]There you go.
[284:55.85]You just cleared it.
[284:57.67]You just did that.
[285:00.29]You... Why?
[285:02.65]What are you doing?
[285:03.83]Why?
[285:04.75]There's no reason for that to... You cleared that already.
[285:25.68]Look at that fight down here.
[285:29.24]Quick fill in C. They're doing it again.
[285:40.03]And now you're about to fill in A again.
[285:52.85]Change stream title.
[285:54.15]Yeah, I will.
[285:54.65]There you go.
[286:10.42]There you go.
[286:10.74]Chat must complete a Picross level or I stream this forever is the title of this stream.
[286:32.25]There you go.
[286:34.25]Ooh, actually cleared the top row.
[286:36.47]You cleared the top row.
[286:44.35]X is back on the zeros.
[286:45.33]Yeah, you're good.
[286:45.93]You got it.
[286:48.88]Oh, look what's coming up here next.
[286:51.22]Good work.
[286:56.18]Coming up next is fill in all B.
[287:04.52]Take your hands off!
[287:06.22]Look, I'm just trying to help.
[287:07.90]I'm just trying to help you guys.
[287:16.95]You guys are never gonna get away from this.
[287:20.03]You're gonna fill in A and fill in B and then remove the zeros and put the zeros back.
[287:25.01]Forever.
[287:33.29]Can I lower the countdown?
[287:34.53]I don't think I can.
[287:35.61]I think it's just the way it is.
[287:48.60]Guys, okay.
[287:51.50]If Twitch chat could complete Dark Souls, I'm pretty sure you can do a 15 by 15 P-Cross level.
[288:04.19]Twitch chat has completed all the Pokémon games.
[288:06.45]They've beat Dark Souls.
[288:18.25]The difference is your chat is dumb.
[288:38.94]Filling in H7?
[288:40.50]What the fuck is H7?
[288:46.29]Oh shit, somebody's doing it!
[288:56.30]You got it!
[288:56.94]You did it!
[288:57.50]Somebody did it!
[288:59.24]Somebody filled in H7.
[289:02.12]And somebody's about to un-fill in H7.
[289:05.24]You're gonna take it away.
[289:11.81]Why?
[289:12.13]You haven't golfed anything.
[289:36.69]Some people are trying.
[289:37.67]They really are.
[289:51.62]I'm seeing a lot less of fill the same row over and over again.
[290:00.22]Just leave the stream on while I sleep and check it in the morning.
[290:13.83]Just mute my microphone.
[290:16.51]Mute the mic.
[290:19.00]And just fucking have at it.
[290:24.46]Am I allowed to do that?
[290:44.57]That's not correct.
[290:46.09]I'm sorry.
[290:46.87]That's incorrect.
[290:56.02]Rename it to Morons Play Picross.
[291:05.59]Oh, good night, guys.
[291:13.17]I'll be looking forward to seeing what you guys do by tomorrow's stream.
[291:23.77]I would laugh my fucking ass off if I keep this stream going all night into tomorrow, and I come wake up and check this, and it's still, uh, F7 gets filled in and removed.
[291:49.11]I'm still here.
[291:49.69]I ain't going anywhere yet.
[291:50.57]I'm curious how this plays out.
[292:04.23]We got a lot of people in complete anarchy.
[292:08.19]We need some people to come in here.
[292:13.07]And really take control.
[292:14.91]And work as a team and get this done.
[292:16.77]And to drown out all the people that are just trying to make it hell.
[292:31.10]Read bits while chat kills your channel.
[292:38.00]I'm not, no, I'm not leaving yet.
[292:40.54]I'm not turning, I'm not leaving.
[292:42.12]Stream's not over.
[292:53.79]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[292:58.44]Play sad music.
[293:05.44]Oh, I heard an entire row.
[293:39.13]Wildly enough look at that.
[293:40.51]We got three in the middle.
[293:42.73]I don't think that's the right place might be Add a timer to the screen
[294:13.47]Yeah, there is a timer.
[294:15.37]Isn't it already on?
[294:26.05]We actually can't.
[294:27.05]The row and column fills are too strong.
[294:42.07]Do a long slow mode.
[294:43.63]Check the settings.
[294:44.31]Come on.
[294:47.39]Pause.
[294:51.63]Show time.
[294:53.34]There you go.
[295:00.20]13 and a half minutes.
[295:05.94]Almost 14 minutes.
[295:12.38]14 minutes and no progress.
[295:13.94]We could actually probably put it on a slow mode, a certain, right?
[295:24.91]Turn off the rows and columns.
[295:28.45]I don't think I can do that.
[295:33.87]See, I can't.
[295:36.87]Fill A1.
[295:38.13]I can't turn them off.
[295:46.60]Click them?
[295:47.84]No, it doesn't do anything.
[295:59.88]Turn off Twitch integration.
[296:01.80]I think you guys can do it.
[296:07.53]Play Brain Power?
[296:08.79]What is Brain Power?
[296:16.04]Brain power.
[296:20.44]This?
[296:24.45]This is too fast!
[296:25.21]Too fast!
[296:25.77]Too much!
[296:26.15]No, no, no!
[296:26.57]Too fast and too upbeat.
[296:35.96]How's it going?
[296:37.28]Still in the same spot.
[296:39.42]Here, I'll help you.
[296:57.73]This is the most non-exciting fucking possible thing you could ever be watching.
[297:05.10]This is not exciting.
[297:14.17]We were supposed to relax.
[297:29.58]Come on, you guys can do it.
[297:31.00]I know you can.
[297:40.57]Someone's just trying to ruin it.
[297:55.72]Take control?
[297:56.44]I can't- I'm not gonna take control.
[298:00.89]Oh, everyone's getting timed up for spamming.
[298:03.93]Uh-oh.
[298:07.21]Wait, what the fuck was that?
[298:16.25]Here comes the Thanos snap.
[298:38.60]Why did I say that?
[298:39.48]That was such a mistake.
[298:42.05]My channel's gonna die.
[298:43.79]My entire streaming career is gonna go down the toilet now.
[298:48.05]You will never finish this level.
[298:50.05]Ever.
[298:54.25]Stop dancing, stop singing, and get this done.
[298:59.67]No, no, no, alright.
[299:01.55]You gotta get this done.
[299:03.75]Look at everybody in this chat.
[299:04.65]Nobody's even working.
[299:17.46]Stop dancing!
[299:19.42]Stop dancing!
[299:24.74]And then you surround me.
[299:27.55]And I start dancing too a little bit.
[299:30.99]Cut this out at once!
[299:33.53]I mean, it is a little fun.
[299:35.48]And even the fucking old disgruntled asshole has a little bit of fun.
[299:48.69]Ah, but for real, you guys are not doing anything.
[299:51.09]You're not getting any progress done.
[299:53.76]It's been 18 minutes.
[299:55.94]The only thing that you have here is what I'm helping you with.
[300:15.90]Play the Doom OST and then we'll complete it.
[300:18.52]That's not going to happen.
[300:21.64]How do I get you guys to work together?
[300:30.05]We don't.
[300:33.41]Could we at least see a little bit of creativity here?
[300:37.50]The same row.
[300:38.90]The same fucking row.
[300:41.96]Not like this row.
[300:44.22]Not this one right here.
[300:46.09]Not like one, two, three random dots.
[300:48.47]No, this exact same row every time.
[301:08.25]Almost.
[301:09.63]Close enough.
[301:15.31]Need to have a vote system.
[301:21.88]Half of the chat is timed out right now.
[301:26.44]Turn on sub only?
[301:34.29]Somebody just came in and said, low effort stream, huh?
[301:38.13]no no this is not what the stream has been the whole time I promise I was playing pick Ross and uh this is what you're seeing is only the last 20 minutes that's a long time it's only been the last 20 minutes this is not I'm I'm trying to
[302:05.58]A reward will.
[302:06.60]Okay.
[302:07.67]Okay.
[302:08.31]Turn this off for a second.
[302:09.57]Hold on.
[302:13.67]If you guys can work together and finish this within the next 20 minutes, I will play Minecraft VR the next time I do a VR stream.
[302:33.79]You want to get rewarded?
[302:35.43]You got 20.
[302:36.29]You got until that says 40.
[302:37.23]I'll give you 40 until that says 45.
[302:39.15]Interesting.
[303:01.38]By the way, oh, hey, let's make this very, very clear as well.
[303:04.98]I'll pause it.
[303:05.50]We're not just, we'll pause it here.
[303:09.11]I'll give you till 50.
[303:09.71]I'll give you 30 minutes.
[303:11.67]Till that says 50 minutes.
[303:12.85]If you guys can do it, I will play Minecraft VR for at least one full hour.
[303:21.03]Okay?
[303:22.49]If you do not do this in 30 minutes, I will never...
[303:28.84]ever ever under any fucking circumstance ever play Minecraft or any Minecraft related content ever on stream ever again in fact I'll never play it again off stream either ever how's that for stakes is Minecraft even a thing no I played it one time on stream
[303:55.25]But people are always like, hey, you should like check out like Minecraft and make Minecraft VR.
[303:59.89]Oh yeah, you'll never see it ever.
[304:03.08]We'll see what chat really wants.
[304:06.60]I'll give you at least an hour in Minecraft VR on the next VR stream.
[304:17.66]Reset the puzzle and go off the in-game timer.
[304:19.52]That's a good idea.
[304:20.22]30 minutes.
[304:22.88]Are you ready?
[304:31.88]sub only I can't do sub only you have to work together sub only if I do sub only you guys will get it done in five minutes sub only I think is cheating
[304:58.72]You give steaks like that and all of a sudden, put it in sub only, man.
[305:02.13]Oh, we'll get it done.
[305:02.75]We'll get it out of sub only and everybody would cool down, grab some like coffee, grab some cider, right?
[305:07.77]Remember that one?
[305:08.43]Oh, he's going to do that again.
[305:11.35]No.
[305:12.53]You got to work together.
[305:16.47]No sub only.
[305:20.87]Minecraft VR.
[305:23.67]And I will recreate the first 12 minutes of that video in VR.
[305:29.39]I'll have a fucking cider there in front of me.
[305:35.82]Good luck.
[306:00.12]You're not going to do it.
[306:02.30]You're not going to do it.
[306:03.84]Take a look at what's already happening.
[306:08.44]Take a look at what's queuing up down there.
[306:10.54]Ooh.
[306:18.91]Ooh, that was mm-mm.
[306:39.96]Somebody just did such a sad face.
[306:44.77]Oh, right here.
[306:47.81]What are you thinking?
[306:51.77]What are you guys thinking right now?
[306:53.51]You don't know that this is here?
[306:58.31]Bottom level, like what are you, why?
[307:02.90]This is a mistake, there's no way, this is impossible for you to win.
[307:10.05]I'm gonna go get another drink.
[307:11.91]BRB.
[307:12.53]Uh, good luck.
[307:19.74]Because you're gonna need it.
[307:24.34]I'll put your, like, fucking Pump It Up song back on.
[307:27.56]Maybe that'll work.
[311:17.18]How's it going?
[311:19.54]Let's see.
[311:19.80]I see.
[311:19.92]A little slow.
[311:46.41]Chat is cheating.
[311:49.32]How?
[311:51.42]How would you cheat?
[311:52.54]Is there a mathematician in chat right now?
[312:04.70]Everybody still relaxed?
[312:13.80]Uh, 24 minutes remain.
[312:24.52]I'm just like eating food right now.
[312:34.67]What a stream.
[312:35.43]I just get to sit here and eat?
[312:43.84]I'm eating a yogurt.
[312:50.62]Low effort streaming.
[312:52.76]That person was right.
[312:55.58]I was like, hey, wait a minute.
[312:56.84]I'm just eating, watching a TV screen.
[313:05.95]Yeah, this is a pretty good show.
[313:07.22]Uh-oh!
[313:36.75]I didn't touch anything.
[313:38.39]I did not touch anything.
[313:42.29]Don't blame that on me.
[313:43.17]You saw my hands.
[313:48.96]Any more song requests?
[313:53.78]No, my mic got turned down somehow.
[313:58.54]Play gas?
[313:59.44]Play this one?
[314:00.05]Gas, gas, gas.
[314:01.95]Okay.
[314:06.07]Is it called gas, gas, gas?
[314:35.08]What is this?
[314:36.04]Who made this?
[314:38.12]I did!
[314:38.54]I did it with you!
[314:39.32]I did!
[314:47.07]Holy shit, you guys are focused.
[314:50.53]That's the easiest, like, chat streamer bait ever.
[314:54.05]You guys are focused like fucking crazy right now.
[315:01.35]I've never seen you like this before.
[315:09.49]You got almost 20 minutes.
[315:17.46]Wait, he said Minecraft VR.
[315:20.78]Get on it.
[315:22.17]Hurry.
[315:40.62]Step on the gas.
[315:49.38]Louder?
[315:50.62]Okay.
[315:58.33]I've gained like 500 viewers, by the way, since getting my hands off the fucking mouse and eating food and watching the screen.
[316:23.51]I invited my entire Discord!
[316:28.96]Well, that's dedication.
[316:38.36]Oops!
[316:40.52]I ruined it, I'm sorry.
[316:46.50]19 minutes.
[316:48.46]You still have quite a few difficult things to fill in here.
[317:01.06]By the way everybody, there was no rule against me fucking with you guys with sound.
[317:13.23]You're getting a little too close here.
[317:27.53]Okay, let me think here.
[317:51.02]What's that?
[317:53.24]There are cats here.
[317:55.60]Everybody loves cats.
[318:20.90]Good luck.
[318:21.28]This is going to be hard.
[318:44.20]Lexi, good girl.
[318:45.08]Ellie, good girl.
[318:46.26]Don't... Don't stay focused.
[319:17.30]oh oh
[319:46.71]That one's too loud.
[319:48.01]I work hard to live a healthy lifestyle for myself and my two kids.
[319:51.65]But no matter what I do, the weight always comes back again.
[319:55.49]There hasn't been something more like this keeping me from losing my weight last year.
[320:15.96]This one's too loud.
[320:16.70]What, this is an ad?
[320:33.02]Wait, what?
[320:33.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[321:01.93]What?
[321:02.33]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[321:03.59]Did I- What?
[321:04.53]You guys weren't even getting started.
[321:29.69]Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[321:32.71]Wait a second, wait a second.
[321:35.27]You guys fucking serious?
[321:40.01]You cheated.
[321:43.47]You guys had a cheat sheet.
[321:44.75]How- wha- where would you get a cheat sheet for this?
[321:53.45]That- no, that doesn't count.
[321:55.08]That doesn't count, you cheated!
[321:57.71]You actually got a cheat sheet.
[322:10.58]No take backs.
[322:12.04]What do you mean no take backs?
[322:14.28]You don't cheat on an exam and the teacher says, hey, little Timmy, I know that you cheated on this math test.
[322:23.66]You got an F. No, I didn't.
[322:25.88]You never said I couldn't cheat.
[322:28.79]Timmy, it's implied that you don't cheat in school.
[322:32.93]The teacher doesn't have to say don't cheat before every test.
[322:45.54]I can't believe it.
[322:46.40]I can't believe you guys actually cheated.
[322:48.56]No.
[322:51.00]I'm taking away the apple cider portion.
[322:55.65]The teacher also doesn't play annoying songs.
[323:06.37]The teacher is sitting there, you're doing like a really important math test.
[323:10.04]That person would get fired.
[323:19.51]Immediately their parent they'd have a parent-teacher conference about the sicko that is trying to ruin the kids exams Alright, alright, yeah, alright really you cheated you lied to my face you cheated right in front of me so therefore Uh, you're not gonna get all those additional perks So
[323:47.93]I will play Minecraft VR.
[323:49.17]I'm not going to recreate the first 12 minutes of GermanCraft.
[323:57.04]You cheated too?
[323:57.52]Well, hey, we both cheated.
[324:00.42]You cheated first.
[324:02.42]I waited 15, 14, 15 minutes before I cheated.
[324:05.92]You cheated from the very beginning.
[324:08.85]Passing around your notes, the whole classroom had the fucking cheat sheet.
[324:28.04]Oh, by the way, something's really funny.
[324:29.85]When I put on the You're Welcome song, somebody actually wrote.
[324:33.45]They were just like, hey man, like, Disney doesn't fuck around with, like, copyright claims.
[324:37.35]Like, take that off.
[324:47.84]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[324:49.24]I want to do one.
[325:00.38]Stop!
[325:03.18]Hey, well that was fun.
[325:05.58]Now it's my turn.
[325:11.98]We gained almost one and a half thousand viewers during that.
[325:16.45]Oh shit, I gotta change the title.
[325:21.77]This is called... Picross Bedtime.
[325:29.98]No, you guys did it.
[325:30.68]You did do it even though it was completely and totally not for real.
[325:39.43]You broke my trust.
[325:44.97]Well, what the fuck do I care?
[325:46.03]I ate a full yogurt and sat there for like 45 minutes.
[325:49.21]I didn't have to do anything.
[325:52.31]I had to play- I played loud sounds once in like 40 minutes.
[325:59.47]Oh yeah, I should be thanking you guys.
[326:00.49]That was like the easiest 40 minutes of the stream I've ever done.
[326:12.38]Alright.
[326:17.63]Andy Streamer?
[326:18.83]Andy Streamer.
[326:19.71]What are we talking about?
[326:24.49]What?
[326:24.77]What are you?
[326:25.16]What?
[326:28.88]It was an open book.
[326:37.08]Alright.
[326:38.85]1, 3, 4, 1, 2.
[326:40.91]Fraud, fraud.
[326:41.69]I'm not the fraud.
[326:42.47]You're the fraud.
[326:43.59]You fraudulated me.
[326:44.91]Okay?
[326:45.65]14.
[326:48.13]So we got, how much did we cross?
[326:49.63]15 by 15?
[326:50.05]It was an open book example.
[327:00.03]Uh, how long are we doing this for?
[327:01.01]Like five and a half hours?
[327:01.99]Jesus, I didn't think we'd be doing it this long.
[327:04.27]That's just how much, you can just tell how much fun we've been having.
[327:07.03]It's been five and a half hours.
[327:09.98]We haven't done anything but this.
[327:18.50]Uh, but tomorrow, I'm not done yet.
[327:20.64]I'm gonna do like another couple levels.
[327:21.68]Uh, tomorrow, we're gonna do The Sims 4 in first person.
[327:28.80]I'm gonna see how it is
[327:33.30]I wonder if it'll be any fun.
[327:36.68]No Minecraft VR tomorrow.
[327:38.28]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[327:40.32]One, that's one, two, three.
[327:42.36]One, two, three, four.
[327:44.05]One, two, that one's free.
[327:48.45]Mods?
[327:48.77]Yeah, I'm gonna have some mods too.
[327:52.07]We are gonna do a new family, by the way.
[327:56.14]Not the same family.
[328:05.08]We're gonna condense the family, not like 10 people.
[328:10.80]Did I already make them?
[328:11.67]No, it's more fun to make them when you guys are hanging out.
[328:17.43]Are you kidding me?
[328:18.05]Mr. Andy, this was the funniest shit of my life.
[328:21.63]You're welcome.
[328:22.41]I'm glad you had fun.
[328:25.13]First person Sims 4 can get you motion sick.
[328:27.53]I think that's the least of my problems considering like the murder serial killer mod is probably gonna get turned on again.
[328:37.19]I'm going to try to find some other ones that we didn't do.
[328:40.17]Alright, let's see.
[328:42.51]1, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[328:44.35]No.
[328:48.77]Nice job bringing back the fun.
[328:52.35]Alright, what do we got?
[328:56.39]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[328:57.93]Not quite.
[329:05.19]Five, let's see.
[329:09.97]If you don't complete this in 15 minutes, you have to do a 24 hour stream.
[329:14.55]I can't do that.
[329:16.03]I'm not gonna time myself.
[329:19.79]Seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nope.
[329:22.83]Let's see, six.
[329:29.21]Six of one.
[329:33.06]6, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[329:33.16]Not quite.
[329:35.62]Again.
[329:35.90]This is what my grandpa plays when he makes dad noises at the kitchen table drinking stale coffee.
[329:45.26]He's got some pretty good taste.
[329:55.53]Andy.

[330:32.24]It's not like I opened up Twitch for the first time ever yesterday.
[330:39.20]But for real, though, I gotta figure it out.
[330:40.60]One, two, three, four, five.
[330:42.65]One, two, three, two.
[330:45.01]No, I can't just guess.
[330:52.11]I guess I could do one, two, three, four, five.
[330:54.15]No, one, two, three, four, five.
[330:57.37]One, two, three, four, five.
[330:59.25]Okay, so...
[331:02.27]Neither one of those, but not like that matters, it's one.
[331:07.77]Well, I can do that down here though.
[331:09.33]So one, two, three.
[331:13.11]One, two, three.
[331:13.79]Okay, getting somewhere.
[331:20.59]Five, we've got one, two, three, four, five, no.
[331:23.61]One, two, three, four, five.
[331:25.59]One, two, three, four, five, okay.
[331:37.58]Play Trollolo for 10 hours.
[331:40.22]No.
[331:44.67]You sound like an optometrist.
[331:46.63]Like an eye doctor?
[331:53.86]An optometrist.
[332:27.71]Don't get it When it comes to your vision you can never be too careful, that's why we're proud to be the top local optometrist That sound like me
[332:57.78]Comes to your vision you can never be too careful Have you ever had an eye test yeah, I have my perfect 614 vision
[333:26.26]What's wrong with an optometrist?
[333:27.25]They make like $600,000 a year and they're like incredibly well respected.
[333:30.85]They do a lot for the medical field.
[333:32.15]Why would I be embarrassed about that?
[333:33.37]Who cares?
[333:42.67]We've lost 1,500 viewers since chat stopped playing.
[333:45.17]Well, I did also say that that was it.
[333:47.94]I said I was going to do two more.
[333:49.68]And then people were like, yeah, I'm probably good.
[333:51.50]I'm probably going to get out of here.
[333:55.56]Alright, we'll see.
[333:56.22]One... Stop stalling?
[333:59.74]Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[334:00.94]You're right.
[334:01.26]Stop stalling.
[334:04.48]Let's get the shitty... I'm not going to say shitty.
[334:06.87]This is a great game.
[334:12.91]Alright.
[334:13.89]One, five, six.
[334:15.61]I could probably eliminate something here, and I already did.
[334:19.11]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[334:21.55]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[334:25.10]Does that give me anything?
[334:26.00]No, it doesn't.
[334:26.74]Shit.
[334:34.36]Oh, you're about to head out?
[334:36.02]No, that's all good.
[334:37.80]You gonna stop by tomorrow?
[334:38.70]We'll see you tomorrow.
[334:40.64]This stream's pretty much getting close to being over.
[334:42.62]I just wanted to relax for a little bit today.
[334:46.10]Actually, that actually does help me.
[334:53.12]No, it doesn't.
[334:53.92]Shit.
[334:57.19]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[334:58.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[334:59.74]Okay.
[335:01.38]Does that do anything for me at all?
[335:05.50]Not really.
[335:07.28]We've been relaxing all day.
[335:11.81]Yeah.
[335:13.99]We're just chilling.
[335:14.75]We're just hanging out.
[335:18.67]3, 1, 2, 3.
[335:19.11]I just don't know.
[335:23.44]This is my first time in your stream and I stayed the whole stream.
[335:25.74]Well, welcome, Andrew.
[335:26.60]Thanks for staying.
[335:30.12]We fuck around a lot here, but... It's all in good fun.
[335:34.07]Welcome.
[335:37.19]I don't know any of this.
[335:41.27]Although, 2 and then space... Let's just say it starts here.
[335:47.54]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[335:51.65]1, 2, 3.
[335:52.47]1, 2.
[335:52.59]I guess it could... It's got to be some of these in the middle here.
[335:54.49]The 5 in the middle.
[335:56.51]That's a guess, but I think it's worth a shot.
[336:03.01]What a shitty first stream to watch.
[336:04.83]What's wrong with this stream?
[336:05.79]I like this stream.
[336:06.66]I thought this was fun.
[336:14.82]This, that, this 5...
[336:18.39]four is probably four and that's one six okay that's either that's probably two
[336:45.68]1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
[336:46.00]I think that works.
[336:47.90]I think that's good.
[336:48.48]But what about the middle here?
[336:49.58]1, 5, 3, 2.
[336:50.08]Is this 5?
[336:54.13]Or is this the space in between where the 3 is?
[336:57.61]1, 2, 3, 1, 2.
[336:58.93]Because then that would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[337:02.53]I'm liking it.
[337:05.49]I'm liking it so far.
[337:06.57]I'm liking it.
[337:07.09]2, 2 again.
[337:14.36]That was a perfect co-op.
[337:15.36]It really was.
[337:18.64]Got that one.
[337:21.46]Alright.
[337:21.80]One, two, three, four, five.
[337:31.95]Oh, fuck.
[337:38.30]Shit, this doesn't work.
[337:43.80]No!
[337:44.14]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[337:47.68]It's already screwed up.
[337:48.66]One, four... This works, though.
[337:59.53]This is okay, I think.
[338:09.05]Skeleton fruit?
[338:13.92]If you had the cheat sheet, this wouldn't be hard.
[338:15.54]I'm not gonna use the cheat sheet.
[338:19.38]It has to be here.
[338:24.55]If that's not correct, then I've got more problems.
[338:27.93]That's all seven.
[338:32.39]And then three... Okay, there's the five in the middle, so it's three again.
[338:40.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[338:41.13]Does that work, though?
[338:41.93]1, 2, 3.
[338:42.07]Fuck.
[338:42.45]1, 2, 3, 4, 5 does.
[338:42.81]That's 5.
[338:42.99]1, 2, 1.
[338:43.09]3 is left.
[338:43.39]You got the 2, then you got the 3.
[338:47.09]I think it's currently working out.
[338:48.41]It's 3.
[338:48.69]2, 3. 3.
[339:12.44]This looks really messed up, but I think I got it.
[339:14.68]Three.
[339:19.22]Three again.
[339:19.80]Then that's five.
[339:24.04]No, this is good.
[339:25.91]Okay.
[339:30.49]It's Sans.
[339:35.87]I don't know about that.
[339:36.97]Now we need six.
[339:38.10]One, two, three, four.
[339:40.52]Oh no.
[339:55.48]This shit's fucking wrong.
[339:57.36]That's correct.
[339:59.88]That's correct.
[340:01.42]But I don't know.
[340:02.72]Three and then three.
[340:04.15]So now that's correct.
[340:07.25]There's your two.
[340:08.33]I need a four in here somewhere.
[340:10.31]What the?
[340:14.01]Where's the four?
[340:21.24]Is this the four?
[340:23.02]No.
[340:23.96]One, two, four?
[340:30.18]One, two, three?
[340:34.03]I think this is the four right here.
[340:37.43]Two, no, this is the four right here.
[340:48.32]Okay, hold on.
[340:54.76]His 15 minutes are up.
[340:55.78]I didn't have any stakes.
[340:59.22]There were no stakes put on here.
[341:06.52]Five, two.
[341:08.12]That is the two.
[341:10.73]One, two, three, four, five.
[341:15.75]Two, seven, three.
[341:16.71]There it is.
[341:18.43]Two, but...

[342:22.28]There's a lot of these big ones.
[342:23.38]Okay, so now I got both edges here.
[342:27.18]That's great.
[342:29.46]One.
[342:31.08]One.
[342:31.84]Two.
[342:33.14]One.
[342:33.54]Three.
[342:36.82]Four.
[342:39.06]Five.
[342:41.17]Some type of staircase?
[342:43.09]It's a weapon.
[342:43.61]I'm not exactly sure what kind of weapon looks like this.
[342:55.02]Okay, that's the one, two, two, three, that's too many, five, two, three, four, five, six.
[343:13.57]I love these ones.
[343:16.47]What the hell is this?
[343:22.31]It's the weirdest looking weapon.
[343:23.93]Is it the negative space here that I'm supposed to be looking at?
[343:31.94]Okay, so let's take a look at what we got.
[343:36.26]We got two, six, and then two.
[343:41.74]Four, two, four.
[343:43.94]Five, four, one, two, three, four, one, not quite.
[343:49.13]Same deal here.
[343:50.73]Two, two, one, no, two, one, one, two, three, and four, not quite.
[344:00.00]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[344:03.32]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[344:06.76]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[344:09.84]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[344:12.40]Good.
[344:12.92]One, two, three, block it.
[344:14.34]Two, block it.
[344:16.90]One, one.
[344:32.71]Okay.
[344:36.74]So that's probably the one.
[344:38.28]One of the ones.
[344:39.98]Can't be a four.
[344:41.76]Can it?
[344:42.42]One.
[344:43.18]No.
[344:44.72]Okay.
[344:48.26]Have I played Bob Ross Picross?
[344:49.90]I have not.
[344:51.74]I've played a lot of these different kinds of Picross games.
[344:57.74]Not that one, though.
[345:01.38]Well, it has to be in here, so one, two, three, four, five.
[345:04.38]One, two, three, four, five.
[345:10.65]And we got three.
[345:14.57]I'm relaxed right now.
[345:16.19]I feel fucking great.
[345:19.85]Really.
[345:27.40]I can do this way too.
[345:28.42]So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[345:29.04]Should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[345:32.62]We've got some things to fill in here.
[345:34.38]There's three.
[345:34.74]Fill in a bit.
[345:54.91]Play the brown note again.
[345:56.67]No.
[345:59.83]I can't.
[346:01.49]I can't.
[346:01.83]That's too much.
[346:02.45]Alright, now is that?
[346:08.58]There's one there.
[346:10.82]One, two, three, four.
[346:12.28]Somewhere in the middle here.
[346:13.02]And then one.
[346:15.40]There's another one above here.
[346:18.49]Because that's not one, two, three, four.
[346:20.25]No, that has to be one.
[346:21.95]So there's a four somewhere in the middle here.
[346:23.49]One, two, three, four.
[346:24.75]One, two, three, four.
[346:25.89]Bingo.
[346:29.98]Okay.
[346:32.42]This is part of the four.
[346:33.52]So one, two, three, four.
[346:36.24]One, two, three, four.
[346:37.58]One, two, three, four.
[346:43.78]This is three.
[346:48.74]Nothing else down there?
[346:49.58]No.
[346:50.60]This is part of the five.
[346:53.86]One, two, three, four, five.
[346:56.22]One, two, three, four, five.
[347:00.02]I can't deduce it from here.
[347:00.88]I'm looking for a three.
[347:04.48]One.
[347:05.82]So if it's right here, space one, two, three.
[347:09.36]One, two, three.
[347:10.10]It has to be right here.
[347:11.26]At least one of them.
[347:14.20]One.
[347:14.36]And there's your three right there.
[347:15.72]Completed.
[347:16.36]Thank you.
[347:16.72]Yep.
[347:20.39]Guess streamer sucks.
[347:26.53]That's not right.
[347:30.20]So looking for a one and then the three looking for five in the middle.
[347:34.18]One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five.
[347:41.96]Alright.
[347:42.26]Getting a little weird here.
[347:43.26]I got to slow down.
[347:47.64]This is part of the four.
[347:49.12]That's it for this.
[347:51.46]Wolf is four in here, too.
[347:53.38]One, two, three, four.
[347:54.60]One, two, three, four.
[347:56.65]One, two, three, four.
[347:57.69]One, two, three, four.
[347:58.79]Okay.
[348:01.43]This is part of the six in here.
[348:02.79]De-deuce, de-deuce, de-deuce, de-deuce, de-deuce.
[348:11.72]So that means... So three, this is six.
[348:16.77]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[348:18.97]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[348:21.09]Alright.
[348:22.51]Two, three, four, five, six.
[348:24.59]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[348:28.60]Looking good.
[348:30.90]This is the one.
[348:32.46]This is the three.
[348:33.72]One, two, three.
[348:34.52]One, two, three.
[348:35.14]It has to be here.
[348:35.76]Here's the two.
[348:38.04]Here's the one.

[350:27.71]This is part of the five.
[350:34.14]So therefore... Well, this is definitely not here.
[350:46.32]One, two, three, four, five.
[350:47.97]Okay.
[350:52.06]That's two right there.
[350:53.56]Is this going the right direction?
[350:55.64]It might be.

[353:29.64]From here, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[353:30.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[353:30.82]No, this works because it already started up here.
[353:32.90]That's fine.
[353:57.55]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[354:00.68]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[354:04.12]That's two, two, two, two.
[354:10.49]They're all twos.
[354:11.79]One, two, three, four, five, six, and eight.
[354:19.73]Which brings us to this two... Oh, there's three in the middle here.
[354:24.81]One, two, three.
[354:27.11]One, one.
[354:28.36]No.

[354:35.58]Let's see.
[354:36.32]One, two, three, four.
[354:37.78]This could be the one.
[354:40.17]Let's see if this is the one.
[354:42.05]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[354:44.47]Yeah, it could be the one.
[354:46.97]I just don't know.
[354:47.43]Is there still enough room for it to be the one?
[354:50.04]12 is right here, though.
[354:56.94]So 1, 2, 3, like this.
[354:57.38]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[354:57.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[354:58.44]What does that do for us?
[354:59.98]That's one.
[355:00.32]They're all ones.
[355:15.81]okay any more big numbers I don't see any this does narrow this down though one two three no two two one two two so this could be here oh it has to be because of those two cool
[355:43.29]And this also is two.
[355:46.51]Two.

[378:31.51]I don't know.
[378:32.47]Let's see.
[378:32.97]What is...
[378:34.63]He was in the chat.
[378:36.07]He wants you to join his chat.
[378:37.39]Well, we're gonna come over there right now.
[378:39.97]We're literally gonna raid over there in about 30 seconds.
[378:43.07]Is he streaming right now?
[378:44.49]How come?
[378:45.01]But he didn't just record those clips and send them to us.
[378:49.43]He's watching the stream right now?
[378:53.35]Hey, man, what's up?
[378:55.09]Hey.
[378:59.19]You fucking ready to get challenged, man?
[379:07.48]I got me bringing it to you.
[379:08.84]That's all I got to say.
[379:13.70]My eyes are puffy because I was out in the wind.
[379:16.72]It was wicked windy today.
[379:18.14]I'm not fucking crying.
[379:19.10]Whatever.
[379:19.42]You are.
[379:19.76]Shut up.
[379:25.05]But I'm around.
[379:25.83]You want to do this?
[379:26.77]And I feel like I'm just talking.
[379:28.95]Can I watch his stream?
[379:29.91]So I need to get his reaction in real time.
[379:34.89]Because we can't- we have to talk to each other here through streams.
[379:39.25]So I'm gonna watch his stream.
[379:45.09]And we can talk that way.
[379:48.04]He just sneezed in my fucking face.
[379:51.60]Hey, thanks a lot.
[379:52.58]I really appreciate that.
[379:58.18]And now I got an ad.
[380:01.22]Look, I'm making sure that I can- you hear this?
[380:06.65]Okay, let's see.
[380:09.17]What do we got?
[380:13.59]Where's... Taking that stake and I'm flipping it, baby.
[380:17.12]You think you can challenge me at Pogo?
[380:19.00]Destroy you!
[380:20.92]Alright, Jerma.
[380:23.44]You might be listening right now and the audio might...
[380:26.79]I don't care because it's the challenge.
[380:28.57]I accept your challenge and I'm going to make you cry.
[380:30.87]No, you have to mute your stream.
[380:32.51]Because when the WWE Super Pythons comes out... You have to mute your stream when you say things.
[380:38.99]You have to mute your stream when you say things.
[380:43.15]No, I'm not muting my stream.
[380:45.85]I'm not muting my stream for nobody.
[380:47.53]Alright, you're not going to... Okay, here we go.
[380:49.29]Listen.
[380:49.53]If you think you want to fuck with me, have you seen how big my arms are?
[380:56.77]That's fine.
[380:57.23]You can yell as loud as you want.
[381:00.19]I'm going to do an arm wrestling competition.
[381:01.99]I'll fucking destroy you.
[381:02.83]I'm going to do an arm wrestling competition.
[381:07.95]I'll fucking destroy you.
[381:12.39]There's too many things happening.
[381:14.05]He thinks he's going to pogo stick challenge.
[381:18.35]Yeah.
[381:18.63]Get dunked on, motherfucker.
[381:22.39]It's been a pogo stick challenge.
[381:23.95]Yeah, I'm taking that pogo stick challenge.
[381:26.81]I'm taking that pogo and I'm slamming it somewhere else.
[381:32.84]Oh, where?
[381:33.94]Where?
[381:35.00]Doesn't want to break TOS.
[381:36.98]Doesn't want to break terms of service.
[381:39.00]It's all about the terms of service.
[381:40.88]I'll just say it.
[381:42.04]I'm going to shove it as far as I can get it.
[381:50.46]Up your chimney!
[381:51.22]So then when you have a fire next, it's gonna fucking burn your house down!
[381:54.94]Okay, so I think he said yes.
[381:56.56]I think a yes is what we got out of that.
[381:58.20]Okay, good.
[382:24.10]Just a taste for what's to come.
[382:30.73]You agree?
[382:31.17]Yeah, I agree too.
[382:31.95]Alright, we're good.
[382:39.75]30... I'm not 35 years old yet.
[382:42.32]Okay?
[382:42.68]You can use that joke in two or three years.
[382:48.02]Who is the other guy?
[382:48.68]That's Joel.
[382:50.28]That is Joel.
[382:54.13]We're about to raid them.
[382:58.63]He wants to shake.
[382:59.33]He wants no screaming.
[383:01.97]He promises not to scream.
[383:03.09]Are you sure?
[383:06.59]No screaming.
[383:07.90]No screaming.
[383:08.60]No screaming.
[383:09.44]Okay.
[383:10.22]Alright.
[383:11.72]Here's what I propose if you're listening, Jeremiah.
[383:14.56]In 10 seconds, we're going to count down together.
[383:17.08]We're going to scream in 10 seconds.
[383:18.00]We're going to shake on it, and then we're going to say...
[383:21.57]I'm gonna win!
[383:36.57]You better believe that the master of the pogo comes out, and you better believe that I'm gonna win.
[383:49.86]Ooh, yeah.
[383:51.32]Mamma mia.
[383:53.26]I'm making that pepperoni deep dish pizza pie.
[383:56.46]Ooh, I'm making you in.
[383:57.54]Ooh, I'm gonna take a crunch and go munch, munch, munch, because karma ain't shit for the Varg Skillethor.
[384:03.88]Well, I mean, I'm going to do this a little more civilized because, like, you know, just showing just the extreme low intelligence of screaming.
[384:13.75]I mean, why screaming?
[384:15.11]First of all, I'm going to say I accept your challenge.
[384:22.69]And I'm being screamed at by, I mean, I can just smell, your IQ has to be like 20.
[384:29.34]I mean, mine's like 180.
[384:30.40]It's way higher than anybody you've ever met in your whole life.
[384:33.40]And I know that that's what, I have an advantage here.
[384:36.12]It's a pretty good one.
[384:38.05]I don't resort to screaming.
[384:39.27]I don't resort to fucking yelling at people.
[384:41.51]I don't yell at people, okay?
[384:43.69]Like somebody I know, the initial challenge.
[384:47.12]Now you got me yelling.
[384:48.84]Oh, you watching?
[384:50.26]You watching the cam?
[384:51.56]How's this for a cheat code?
[385:01.32]You seen that?
[385:02.58]Zoom in on that on your stream.
[385:04.70]Oh, you think you got that shit?
[385:06.34]Well, guess what?
[385:07.26]Guess what?
[385:07.90]My biceps are so big, they don't fucking have 69 on stream anymore.
[385:12.08]They have fucking ultra-vork scale dimensions, alright?
[385:15.94]Listen, listen, here's what's going to happen, alright?
[385:19.44]No, no, we don't do that.
[385:21.13]Listen.
[385:22.85]No!
[385:23.45]No!
[385:24.27]Listen!
[385:25.19]Anytime!
[385:25.81]Any day!
[385:27.23]We're gonna do it!
[385:28.31]No!
[385:28.85]No!
[385:30.25]No!
[385:30.83]No, you don't corrupt!
[385:31.75]Deflected!
[385:32.53]Deflected!
[385:33.19]Whoosh!
[385:34.00]Whoosh!
[385:34.88]Left!
[385:35.52]Right!
[385:36.06]Baby!
[385:36.72]Super punch out!
[385:37.70]Listen!
[385:38.08]No!
[385:38.58]My internet's dying!
[385:39.72]No!
[385:40.36]Deflection armor on!
[385:41.68]Deflection armor comes off!
[385:44.02]No!
[385:44.64]Left down!
[385:45.76]Under!
[385:46.26]Off down!
[385:47.25]Whoosh!
[385:47.79]Whoosh!
[385:55.76]This is a freaking Morty stream.
[385:58.76]Which one of us is which?
[386:05.25]This is freaking Morty.
[386:13.22]We're both Morty?
[386:14.38]No, no way.
[386:15.78]I refuse to believe that.
[386:22.66]Did you hear that?
[386:23.48]I hope you understand that we're both apparently fucking Morty.
[386:29.96]Alright, whoever wins the competition doesn't get to be Morty.
[386:35.22]I'm playing to be Rick.
[386:36.90]You know what I'm saying?
[386:46.81]Joey said PlayStation.
[386:47.85]He said... What?
[386:53.00]He wants to be Rick.
[386:54.80]No, no.
[386:55.22]Okay, now he's listening.
[386:56.44]Listen, listen.
[386:57.94]Okay, no screaming this time.
[387:00.29]Listen, Jerma, no screaming this time.
[387:02.15]I accept your challenge.
[387:03.79]Okay.
[387:04.09]Hit me up on Discord, Twitter.
[387:05.65]We'll work this out.
[387:06.55]I don't have any of those.
[387:07.79]Then we'll see who has the bigger brain.
[387:12.65]And you better believe I'm not going to yell.
[387:16.80]But I'm going to tell you, I'm going to win, okay?
[387:20.22]I have Skype.
[387:21.58]I have the 2006 client for Skype, so you're going to have to get me through there.
[387:30.40]Listen, here's what we're going to do.
[387:33.45]If you want to do it old school, then we're going to say, screw Discord, screw Skype.
[387:37.83]We're going to do this on...
[387:41.00]ICQ or something really old, so it sounds like we're talking through microwaves, alright?
[387:47.83]And the loser has to communicate through that client for the rest of the year, alright?
[387:52.81]They get stripped of the privilege to use modern technology, alright?
[387:55.19]Speech jamming each other.
[387:56.73]Oh, my God.
[387:57.39]AOL, AOL.
[387:58.45]You're going to be streaming from an AOL disc, buddy.
[388:00.83]Okay, no yelling, I told you, but no.
[388:02.65]Okay, that's what we do.
[388:03.35]Oh, my God.
[388:04.98]You're gonna be streaming from an AOL disc, buddy.
[388:07.34]Okay, no yelling, I told you.
[388:08.54]Alright, so here we go.
[388:10.58]We now... Smoke signals.
[388:12.22]Exactly.
[388:12.98]So here's what's gonna happen.
[388:17.47]I'm gonna mute my stream so we can hear you.
[388:21.23]First of all, challenge is accepted.
[388:23.77]The person that loses is Morty.
[388:25.25]The person that wins is Rick.
[388:27.55]It's huge stakes.
[388:29.07]Nobody wants to be Morty.
[388:30.03]Everyone wants to be Rick.
[388:33.55]And that's... I'll accept those, uh... those terms.
[388:42.07]And by the way, we're coming to raid you in about... like, two hours.
[388:47.44]So you better be ready for a, uh... Jerma985 raid.
[388:57.23]Rick and Morty isn't cool anymore.
[389:01.23]I know.
[389:03.35]I still don't wanna be Morty.
[389:06.19]Listen.
[389:07.77]I know.
[389:09.55]Listen.
[389:09.83]I still don't wanna be Morty.
[389:14.98]Alright, alright, I'm getting out of here.
[389:16.92]I'm getting, my stream's over.
[389:17.98]Don't you see the screen?
[389:20.72]Just bottle up all your anger and rage and unleash it on me in like three days, okay?
[389:31.00]You want to see what's going to happen?
[389:32.25]You ready for this?
[389:33.43]Okay.
[389:33.87]Tell, tell Jerma, tell Jerma to check, check my stream out.
[389:37.53]Okay.
[389:37.79]Oh, I see it.
[389:39.81]Oh, it says Jerm.
[389:41.25]It says Jerm.
[389:42.65]Okay.
[389:44.11]I'm looking at Jerma.
[389:51.23]Oh, he's putting, he's putting Jerma over, over.
[389:54.58]Nope.
[389:56.28]Why don't you just put in a Jerma over stream?
[389:59.20]So it says Jerma over.
[390:00.60]Okay.
[390:02.35]Why don't you just put in a Jerma over stream?
[390:05.75]So it says Jerma over.
[390:07.13]Okay.
[390:09.23]I get it.
[390:09.57]That's interesting stuff.
[390:15.84]Are you typing?
[390:16.54]Are you typing in my stream?
[390:18.34]No, you're typing on your stream.
[390:19.42]Jerma equals boo.
[390:20.00]Boo.
[390:20.18]Are you typing in my stream?
[390:22.94]Boo.
[390:23.08]Are you typing on your stream?
[390:26.04]Booger.
[390:27.00]Gerber is a booger.
[390:28.86]I scored.
[390:31.10]I scored.
[390:32.58]Booger.
[390:33.54]Gerber is a booger.
[390:35.29]Alright, well, I unsubscribed from him, so... Hey, if you win, I'll resubscribe.
[390:47.01]Look, hold on a minute.
[390:47.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[390:49.18]Hold on.
[390:50.94]Hold on a second here.
[390:55.64]Let's go back to his stream.
[391:00.50]Watch this.
[391:02.44]Watch this.
[391:02.80]Oh, I'm going to drop this shit on him right now.
[391:05.40]Check this out.
[391:06.48]Oh, no, I'm not subscribed.
[391:07.70]I never was.
[391:08.62]No, it says re-subscribe.
[391:09.83]What?
[391:12.29]Oh, I was only subscribed for like two months.
[391:15.03]Like a year ago.
[391:17.37]Oh, shit.
[391:19.85]Now I look like a bad guy.
[391:22.23]Forget everything I just said.
[391:29.83]No, I'm not.
[391:31.61]Wait, were you ever subscribed to me?
[391:34.39]Two losers.
[391:36.57]Haha.
[391:37.65]Were you ever subscribed to me?
[391:40.17]Yes, I was, but I unsubscribed through my brain this time because I knew this was coming.
[391:44.72]I felt it like a spider feels rain.
[391:50.40]It knows to retract like that.
[391:54.38]Okay.
[391:56.74]Alright, I'm going to get out of here.
[391:58.35]I'm going to do my bit reading.
[391:59.35]Have a good stream.
[392:00.73]You're playing Kid Icarus.
[392:02.03]No, you're not.
[392:02.53]That's... You both have mushrooms.
[392:05.71]You're doing Trash Squad.
[392:07.79]Oh, now I look even worse.
[392:08.79]You're not.
[392:09.13]That's... You both have mushrooms.
[392:17.73]You're doing Trash Squad.
[392:18.67]Somebody gifted Joel a sub.
[392:23.08]Look, you both have mushrooms and you both have names on my followers.
[392:26.40]Let's start with a V. So I went to the first one.
[392:28.67]I thought it was you.
[392:31.45]You're playing Trash Squad.
[392:32.99]Have a good stream.
[392:33.73]Hope it's good.
[392:40.35]Chat rules.
[392:40.91]Please read the rules.
[392:42.09]You have your own rule website?
[392:51.31]But no, I hope you have a good stream.
[392:52.95]For real.
[392:54.47]I'll hit you up on Discord.
[392:55.65]I'll add you on Twitter.
[392:57.60]We'll DM.
[392:58.12]We'll get it ready.
[393:00.54]I'm going to move back over here now.
[393:02.84]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[393:06.22]And you'll be playing Sonic the Hedgehog 3D Recreation SNES Madness and more.
[393:09.78]Lots of stuff going on over on Joel's stream.
[393:12.89]You'll see it really soon when we rate him.
[393:20.15]Alright, I'm going to move back over here.
[393:23.24]Have a good stream.
[393:23.72]Take care, guys.
[393:29.15]Alright, where were we?
[393:31.23]After I was screamed at.
[393:32.21]I was yelled at, and I had... Look, I lashed out.
[393:37.10]I had to.
[393:38.68]I was put back in a corner, and I was getting like... Of course, I'm going to lash out a little.
[393:54.21]Somebody gifted me a sub for Joel, yeah.
[393:56.05]Alright, well, now, like, somebody... Kissy, kissy.
[394:05.64]Let's see what this is.
[394:11.52]What?
[394:11.94]Get away from me!
[394:13.24]Alright, I'm gonna move back over here.
[394:17.60]Okay.
[394:18.74]Yeah, he's...
[394:27.49]What?
[394:27.75]Twitch password?
[394:28.59]Oh, no, no, never mind, never mind.
[394:35.55]What happened to Picross?
[394:37.24]I beat it all.
[394:37.84]I did every puzzle.
[394:43.94]Alright, back earlier.
[394:45.06]Let's go back.
[394:46.72]Find ourselves just about seven hours ago here.
[394:52.43]And we had... We had Manboy.
[394:54.61]Thanks for the $2.50, Manboy.
[394:57.82]Not sure if you've seen it.
[394:59.84]But, uh... CAD has released the Jerma Slots trailer.
[395:04.26]Here it is.
[395:04.64]I'm going to hold off on that because I'm going to start with that.
[395:09.26]I don't want everyone to know about it yet.
[395:13.05]Probably going to start with that over the next day or two whenever it's actually released.
[395:17.37]Joel wants to talk again.
[395:18.67]No, we've talked.
[395:20.27]We have talked.
[395:23.86]No, I'm ending the conversation there.
[395:25.93]I'm going to kick your ass.
[395:27.17]You know what I mean?
[395:29.77]When you and me fight on the battlefield, so for me to kick your ass.
[395:44.98]I'm so glad somebody got that.
[395:46.32]One person did.
[395:51.72]I'm so glad one person thought that was funny.
[395:56.90]He meant on Discord.
[395:59.20]Oh, yeah.
[396:05.63]I didn't start it again.
[396:06.67]I didn't start it again.
[396:08.31]I'm just going to keep going.
[396:10.57]Yeah, the slots game we're going to play.
[396:15.37]Whenever it's ready.
[396:17.71]Spend a little while on it.
[396:18.79]It looks really well done.
[396:19.67]It looks really fun.
[396:22.39]But thank you, Manboy, for the 250.
[396:25.49]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[396:26.41]Hype.
[396:26.67]They say hype.
[396:27.47]PogChamp.
[396:28.13]Picross.
[396:28.81]Hype.
[396:31.77]He's calling you a booger again.
[396:33.53]I'm not even gonna... I'm... I ignore.
[396:36.19]I'm gonna ignore.
[396:38.19]I said my piece.
[396:40.23]If he wants to continue to... Then he can.
[396:44.33]I'm not gonna address it.
[396:59.35]He's mocking me.
[397:00.25]That's okay.
[397:01.67]We'll see who gets the last laugh.
[397:04.41]Time's up.
[397:04.65]It's going to be me after I win the competition.
[397:12.98]He just called you short.
[397:14.00]That's okay.
[397:15.82]Once the... Never mind.
[397:24.32]Forget it.
[397:29.52]sad vega thanks for three bucks what the fuck are you doing I don't know I've lost my mind completely no it's okay don't just don't respond here's the number one thing about a bully is just don't give them don't respond he's gonna try to get me to go on Discord and yell at him and uh no I've reported him to the principal I've talked to the teacher I talked to my mother about it
[398:13.57]What is happening?
[398:14.91]I don't want to have to open up his stream again.
[398:16.93]What the fuck?
[398:20.63]What are you doing now?
[398:23.57]He's playing mind games with me.
[398:28.59]Listen, listen.
[398:31.49]If we did a WWE promotion thing, like...
[398:43.34]Listen, what I just did, and I have this on tape now.
[398:45.87]I would have been like, listen, I respect Jerma.
[398:48.33]I think he's a really cool streamer and all that.
[398:51.73]And I'd love to stream with him.
[398:54.39]And I said nothing mean.
[398:55.87]I said, I'd love to challenge you, my friend.
[398:58.93]And here, like, cut, cut, VHS cut to Jerma.
[399:03.35]And he's just going, you know.
[399:07.41]That's the same thing that I just did.
[399:17.49]We just both did the same mocking sound.
[399:20.09]How is that possible?
[399:21.27]Oh, yeah.
[399:27.43]Okay.
[399:28.25]Alright.
[399:28.73]I'm done.
[399:29.78]I'm done.
[399:30.08]I'm gonna get out of here.
[399:33.00]Did he hear me do that?
[399:43.31]When I turned on the webcam, I looked like fucking like a deer in headlights.
[399:52.54]but sad vega thanks for the three bucks getting to watch you from work I own four thousand shares of jrm stock and only see big performance from it in the future you've already netted me a few thousand dollars dollar dollar dollar you just said that out loud oh I didn't I said it a little differently uh the Twitch stocks yeah the Twitch stocks that weren't really doing uh so well were they
[400:22.80]Not recently.
[400:23.74]It kind of went down.
[400:26.38]Joel just called you a stripper.
[400:29.18]Whatever.
[400:31.34]Is that a problem?
[400:33.34]Is there something wrong with that?
[400:38.02]Okay.
[400:47.75]Chat called you a stripper.
[400:49.19]Okay.
[400:51.37]Whatever.
[400:55.34]Hey, Carly Brady, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[400:56.70]Hey, Jerma, seeing as you like Picross, you should have a look at Hex Cells.
[401:01.08]I think you'd like it as well.
[401:02.88]Love your work as always.
[401:03.68]Thank you, Carly Brady.
[401:06.29]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[401:11.45]Also, we had $40 from Gornhole.
[401:14.27]Thank you, Gornhole, for the 40 bucks.
[401:16.93]That's a lot of money, thank you.
[401:18.81]Local streamer drinks Pac-Man energy drink.
[401:21.30]I'm going to shit my pants, he says.
[401:26.12]What do you mean go vote?
[401:30.38]Who would win in a wrestling match?
[401:33.26]This is not fair.
[401:35.14]No, he's got his like, he just turned his stream on.
[401:38.01]He's got a fully energized chat room.
[401:41.73]I just turned my stream off and we're just relaxing and I don't have a fully energized chat room right now, right at the very beginning of his stream.
[401:50.15]Go fuck that Paul up.
[401:55.76]Oh, fucking go fuck that pole up.
[401:57.14]Go make sure that doesn't happen.
[402:07.07]Make me win that pole on his stream.
[402:09.61]You know what I mean?
[402:10.11]Right now he's going like, what the fuck?
[402:12.63]What?
[402:12.85]No, it's like 50.
[402:13.98]That's impossible.
[402:14.76]Right now he can't believe it.
[402:19.88]Oh, look at this.
[402:20.32]Right now he can't even believe it.
[402:29.40]I'm sorry I can't rightfully vote for you Joel is huge and young it's not about truth it's about manipulation and getting into his head so then on game day he's not prepared and he said wait a minute people didn't think I was gonna win and then I come up from the underdog and scoop under
[402:58.72]I'm a dishonest politician.
[403:00.00]This is not politics.
[403:01.00]This is a fight.
[403:02.55]This is a gamer fight.
[403:04.25]I'm not gonna... Well, as you say, politics.
[403:09.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[403:10.49]We're trying to win.
[403:13.01]You play to win.
[403:19.02]But thank you so much for the $40 going home.
[403:21.14]CDT, thanks for the $250 CDT.
[403:24.62]Hey, Jerma, I've been watching your video since 2012, which doesn't even feel that long ago.
[403:28.31]Can I get a happy birthday since I'm 21?
[403:30.51]Happy birthday.
[403:35.45]Thank you, CDT, for the $2.50.
[403:38.27]Glad to have you around for that long.
[403:39.34]Thank you so much for the $2.50.
[403:42.68]Much love.
[403:43.10]Thank you.
[403:45.80]We also had Divas gave $2.50.
[403:47.68]Thank you, Divas.
[403:49.50]Flugboy gave $2.50.
[403:50.70]Thank you, Flugboy.
[403:53.96]Thanks for the chill stream.
[403:54.82]I needed it after today.
[403:56.42]Here's a King Crimson to erase the time of your day to relax better.
[404:01.06]King Su Crimson.
[404:02.52]I don't know what that is.
[404:08.25]Thank you for the chill response, though.
[404:14.21]And thank you, Flugboy, for the $2.50.
[404:17.49]I need to address the fact that earlier this stream, Fitty gave five tier three community subs.
[404:26.07]That's a lot of money.
[404:27.29]Tier 3 is insanely expensive, especially giving five of them away.
[404:32.80]So thanks a lot.
[404:35.22]Todd Florid, thank you for the 280.
[404:38.20]Minesweeper is better.
[404:39.32]It's just a different game.
[404:43.37]Joel calmed down and said I was cool.
[404:44.97]He's cool too.
[404:50.23]We were just messing around.
[404:51.39]I mean... He's a good dude.
[404:59.54]Thank you, though.
[405:03.56]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[405:04.56]Cancel my last bits.
[405:07.22]On the Picross hype, right?
[405:09.42]I remember that one.
[405:12.00]Thank you, Jack, for the 250.
[405:13.24]Turn on six-hour slow mode.
[405:15.04]Teach chat a lesson.
[405:21.36]No, I think the six-and-a-half-hour Picross stream was enough.
[405:29.66]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the $15 on top of your five tier three subs.
[405:35.29]Sorry, can you explain the game again?
[405:36.55]That was a little quick for me.
[405:38.43]Hopefully six hours later you figured it out.
[405:40.29]That's pretty easy, but kind of difficult.
[405:43.25]You kind of just need to know what's going on.
[405:47.96]Warvoid, thanks for the $5, Warvoid.
[405:49.70]I enjoyed that Thanos with a stroke impression.
[405:54.30]That was so long ago.
[405:55.64]I forgot even doing that.
[406:00.46]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR as somebody's username.
[406:05.02]I'm doing Minecraft VR.
[406:06.18]I told you that was still happening.
[406:09.63]I'm still doing that.
[406:11.99]Your username is completely irrelevant.
[406:15.25]I'm going to play Minecraft in VR.
[406:18.73]I never said I wasn't doing that.
[406:26.71]Topek, thanks for the three bucks, Topek.
[406:29.22]Not sure if you spoke about this already, but any word on why save was removed is unfortunate.
[406:33.24]It killed the off-stream chat.
[406:37.26]I kind of wanted to clean up the off-stream chat a little bit.
[406:40.00]I think a lot of people were kind of just putting commands in.
[406:43.78]I think there was a couple people that had scripts or something to just run in the offline chat.
[406:50.29]I'd rather just people be able to talk.
[406:53.53]It was an old kind of meme, old joke from more than almost a year or two ago.
[407:00.73]You saved them all.
[407:02.73]They were like... You saved 73,000 seagulls.
[407:03.95]You saved every seagull on Earth.
[407:05.07]Why not let it reach 100,000?
[407:06.97]Because there's not 100,000 seagulls on Earth.
[407:11.82]There's only 73,428.
[407:12.14]You got them all.
[407:28.76]The zoo is packed.
[407:29.70]Yeah, there was too many seagulls in that zoo.
[407:38.35]But I cleaned up some commands.
[407:40.79]There's... You know, I'm just doing a cleanup.
[407:45.63]Of kind of nightbot commands, random bot commands.
[407:55.74]But that's pretty much the reason why.
[408:01.47]Talk about the game.
[408:03.93]Not necessarily to counteract the fact that I got rid of that.
[408:08.29]But I turned on that streamer legends game.
[408:11.67]It's that like idling RPG game where you get loot and you fight together.
[408:16.48]Figured maybe something with like offline chat or before a stream starts might be worth just playing around and being able to talk about and hang out.
[408:22.52]I know some other streamers have it on.
[408:25.06]Figured it would just something to just have.
[408:30.68]You can pop it out.
[408:31.34]You can play it.
[408:31.84]There's... Oh, what the fuck?
[408:33.74]I'm... I gotta give the loot!
[408:35.68]I gotta give... I'm only gonna do this once.
[408:37.62]I'm not... I'm gonna... Okay, by the way, I still had Joel's stream up.
[408:42.40]Uh, I could give people loot right now.
[408:44.70]Hold on.
[408:47.02]If you have it open right now, uh, I'm gonna give you, like, a treasure chest.
[408:54.48]I'm definitely not gonna do this all the time.
[408:56.06]Because I'll forget every day.
[408:58.95]Alright, you ready?
[409:00.85]Here it comes.
[409:02.45]Send gifts.
[409:05.97]Bingo.
[409:10.81]Well, it's just something fun to have.
[409:11.84]It doesn't cost any money or anything.
[409:16.58]It's just there if you want to play with it.
[409:22.70]you get gold for killing monsters and you can contribute together as a community to upgrade the barracks and upgrade the base it's just like a little dinky RPG game but it's just gonna be there what's it called they're called stream legends
[409:46.52]Stream legends.
[409:47.58]It's all the way to the bottom of the page.
[409:49.96]I sort of hit it so it was a little, you know, off.
[409:54.45]So it wasn't kind of taking up any real estate on the rules or anything.
[410:01.67]Can you move it further up so we can watch the stream?
[410:03.51]Here's the thing.
[410:03.91]You can pop that window out.
[410:06.53]That window has a pop-out.
[410:07.60]You can put it anywhere you want on any monitor or on any page.
[410:10.00]There's a little button.
[410:18.99]But thank you, Topec.
[410:20.87]Sorry about the seagulls.
[410:23.19]Thank you, Tavasi, for the $15.
[410:24.01]Children?
[410:24.19]What do you mean?
[410:50.82]I didn't yell at Jo- I yelled at Jo- I told Joel that he had 20 IQ.
[410:53.56]I don't know if that was true or not.
[410:56.36]I'm just- remember, manipulation under the skin tactics.
[410:59.48]On game day, he's gonna fucking- it's gonna get to him.
[411:02.96]I'm just gonna drink two Red Bulls and be ready.
[411:05.50]The Pac-Man ones.
[411:11.60]But thank you, Tabassi, for the $15.
[411:13.04]Uh, hey, Manboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[411:16.96]They say this stream in a nutshell...
[411:27.00]Jesus Christ.
[411:29.42]Thank you.
[411:29.92]Thank you, Djack, for the 250.
[411:31.36]You're acting so odd today.
[411:32.66]I feel like the real Jerma died hours ago and this is just air escaping.
[411:36.38]Whatever.
[411:49.39]Watching who gave five community subs.
[411:54.77]Thank you, Watching Who, for the five community subs.
[411:57.56]No, I was just like, I was nutrient-sized today.
[412:01.68]I had a bunch of B vitamins.
[412:02.70]I had some caffeine.
[412:04.02]I had a good frozen dinner.
[412:12.01]But thank you watching Hoop for the Five community subs.
[412:13.55]Appreciate it.
[412:17.35]Robot Joan, thanks for the $2.50.

[414:09.99]Will you ever replay it?
[414:11.37]I mean, that update happened with the radio last year.
[414:13.93]Wouldn't it make sense if you just replayed it?
[414:15.91]I mean, you forgot the swing set glitch.
[414:17.97]What's inside the Statue of Liberty?
[414:20.17]GTA 3 artwork, etc.

[415:22.77]I played so much of it.
[415:25.03]Star and I played that game for so many hours that I don't think I could see anything in that game that I haven't seen yet.
[415:33.33]We modded the fuck out of that game.
[415:34.97]We played hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of fucking hours, probably.
[415:39.17]Just dicking around and doing stuff.
[415:41.83]And I played through the story at least two or three times, so... I had a lot of fun.
[415:47.98]That's one of the best multiplayer experiences I've probably ever had.
[415:57.65]Uh, but thank you, uh, Asuwat, for the five bucks.
[416:00.86]Jeremy, you made me feel like such an asshole.
[416:03.12]I don't actually have a dog.
[416:04.18]I was making a dumb joke.
[416:05.14]I guess everyone must have their one-guy moment somewhere or the other.
[416:10.36]What?
[416:10.56]What?
[416:10.97]What happened?
[416:11.43]The dog?
[416:14.35]I made a dog comment?
[416:21.79]I don't remember what it was.
[416:25.00]I don't actually have a dog.
[416:26.02]I was making a dumb joke.
[416:29.98]What did I say?
[416:30.42]It's not about the dog.
[416:33.08]Oh, the dog going crazy comment.
[416:35.20]Oh.
[416:37.10]Hey, Broluck, thanks for the $2.50.
[416:49.15]The other night your Discord got raided.
[416:50.75]My mate recorded some of it.
[416:53.27]Yeah, I'm aware.
[416:55.21]I am aware of it.
[416:57.45]Thank you, though.
[416:59.83]There was some weird... weird shit going on.
[417:05.27]It was pretty bad.
[417:09.11]No, not the savory dog smell thing.
[417:13.17]But it's been... it's been taken care of.
[417:14.58]It's all good.
[417:16.00]Don't worry about it.
[417:16.52]Everything's all good.
[417:18.88]But thank you, Broluck.
[417:22.52]Appreciate it.
[417:23.96]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the $2.50.
[417:25.38]Jerma, what were you thinking when you called your stream...
[417:28.08]Ultimate relaxation, get fucked into bed.
[417:32.42]What?
[417:34.66]No, I had a T. Is this a dick?
[417:42.19]What is this?
[417:42.63]No.
[417:43.05]Alright.
[417:43.77]What is this?
[417:44.55]It's me as a teacher?
[417:50.31]And this actually is for real now.
[417:52.95]I drew it a while back.
[417:54.11]Let's see.
[417:58.56]In my free time, I like to doodle with Jerma95-related content.
[418:01.59]Oh, that's the Jerma survival.
[418:10.51]These are fucking awesome.
[418:14.42]Thank you, Snooze and Copter.
[418:18.28]I like the design on the survival gear.
[418:22.79]It's good shit.
[418:26.33]Hey, Zoro Carlos, thanks for the three bucks.
[418:28.05]You mentioned marijuana being legal in Las Vegas.
[418:30.07]I actually went on vacation in Las Vegas for the first time last week, and it was really fun.
[418:34.71]However, the one thing I hated was how every fifth pedestrian in the city spat out a cloud of either cigar smoke or weed on my face, and it got a little obnoxious.
[418:43.53]Very fun trip regardless.
[418:44.67]Seems like a nice place to live, too.
[418:49.01]Uh, it is, yeah.
[418:52.53]I mean, I think, I mean, those also might be like vape pens.
[418:58.78]You know?
[419:00.81]Those are fucking everywhere.
[419:03.81]Let me tell you about a stream that I'm not going to do.
[419:05.65]That I thought was potentially funny.
[419:08.05]Spoiler alert for a future stream that's not going to happen because I axed it.
[419:11.65]I was going to play Fortnite in a tank top.
[419:15.96]And just have loud blasting music.
[419:20.26]Have kind of like an odd, weird, shitty camera set up.
[419:24.04]Just ripping a fucking vape pen.
[419:26.74]Just like...
[419:29.86]And eventually what you don't see, I don't really talk that much, what you don't see is over the course of about an hour or two, I have like four fog machines that are slowly going to be used and turned on until the whole room is filled with fog.
[419:48.99]And there is no joke, that's the whole joke.
[419:56.16]Like, I just turn my head like this.
[419:58.86]I go like this shit, like.
[420:05.58]There's a fucking, a thick fucking cloud over here, right?
[420:10.14]All the while, like, smoke is just filling this room.
[420:12.60]Tons of it.
[420:13.10]To a point where you can't even fucking see my face.
[420:14.92]It takes like two hours for it to happen.
[420:16.28]You know, like.
[420:17.50]Alright, wait, wait, where are we dropping?
[420:24.80]For like fucking two straight hours.
[420:35.14]And eventually the smoke alarm was gonna go off.
[420:38.38]Like... And I was gonna keep playing.
[420:44.22]For like another 30 minutes.
[420:46.36]And then eventually the stream was just gonna turn off.
[420:49.24]Without me saying bye.
[421:03.83]Now I'm sad that it didn't happen.
[421:06.29]Well, I was gonna do it in the studio.
[421:08.25]I wasn't gonna do it, like, here.
[421:18.29]Why was it cancelled?
[421:19.17]Do you want me to be honest?
[421:22.39]Because I was gonna have to play Fortnite for two hours.
[421:27.19]I'm not even shitting you.
[421:42.83]Come on, that hasn't been a full-on dress-up joke stream in a while.
[421:48.19]Maybe I'll still do it.
[421:49.61]Just shh, don't tell anybody.
[421:53.39]Hey, Lightning Rider, thanks for the five bucks.
[421:55.05]This has been the most uncomfortable stream so far this year.
[421:57.49]Why?
[421:57.99]What?
[421:58.25]I played Picross for like a few hours.
[422:00.33]Uncomfortable?
[422:01.58]Uncomfortable?
[422:07.64]Thanks for the five bucks, though.
[422:08.52]Thank you something or other for the 250.
[422:09.66]Is it true that your middle name is Sherbert?
[422:13.35]Um, no.
[422:15.53]My middle name is not Sherbert.
[422:16.85]I don't know where you got that info from.
[422:20.45]Thank you.
[422:20.85]Mostly lost for the 250.
[422:21.69]I just got a minor headache from that.
[422:23.41]Lawyer up, chump.
[422:28.56]Mostly lost again.
[422:29.36]Thanks for the 250.
[422:30.16]Just kidding.
[422:30.52]I was constipated and that cured me.
[422:32.06]Thanks.
[422:32.32]You're welcome.
[422:33.38]You're very welcome.
[422:39.37]Smelly boy, thanks for the three bucks.
[422:40.71]You're playing Minecraft tracks.
[422:43.06]Oh, how far the mighty have fallen.
[422:44.82]Did you not hear what I said after that?
[422:50.72]Slow it down.
[422:52.48]If you slow it down enough and you really listen, I think you can faintly hear something like... This is dog shit.
[423:02.05]Right?
[423:02.69]You gotta listen really close and you have to... It's very, very faint.
[423:05.89]You have to play it backwards, too.
[423:14.47]Hey, 420 Squid, thanks for the $4.
[423:16.03]Please play Stall by C418.
[423:19.47]It'll make my night.
[423:22.41]Sorry, I didn't see it.
[423:23.51]I didn't really want this to turn into a music stream, unfortunately.
[423:27.31]So, sorry.
[423:28.97]Kind of turned into that halfway through, somehow.
[423:35.74]Somehow, sometimes we just turn the stream into a...
[423:39.41]I'm going to say a track out loud and then Jeremy's gonna turn and just spam it into YouTube and play it.
[423:46.38]What's wrong with Minecraft music?
[423:47.52]Minecraft music is amazing.
[423:48.68]It's fantastic.
[423:49.50]It's very calming, very wonderful.
[423:54.52]It's very relaxing stuff.
[423:56.00]It was one of the gr- When it rains in Minecraft for the first time and you get that rain song...
[424:02.96]Oh.
[424:04.46]It was great.
[424:05.28]You know, you're sitting in your first ever dirt house, raining outside, fire behind you.
[424:13.02]I don't have a problem with it at all.
[424:15.06]So then play it then, dumbass.
[424:20.71]This is dog shit, but that was just me... I'm just kidding.
[424:24.79]I don't really think that.
[424:25.65]I mean, that song was... I don't really like it that much.
[424:27.57]It was okay.
[424:29.77]Fucking gamma rays, man.
[424:30.57]Hey.
[424:57.23]Mostly lost thanks for the 250, I guess, while we're on the topic of meme songs.
[425:01.81]This masterpiece by Kiwo deserves more love.
[425:06.05]Kiwo made a meme song?
[425:13.08]What the fuck is happening?
[425:24.85]It is backwards.
[425:52.51]So she sang the song backwards and then reversed the backwards to make it queue up with the music.
[426:08.14]This, okay.
[426:09.96]I've done shit like this before with one or two sentences.
[426:14.03]It took like 40 minutes.
[426:16.33]This is a two minute song that you had to queue up.
[426:18.73]This probably took all day.
[426:24.82]and matching it to the music?
[426:46.53]Okay, you know when you give a small child a microphone set, like a three-year-old for Christmas, and they play songs, and they put the microphone right up to their mouth, and they start to sing whatever the song it is?
[427:17.45]That's pretty close.
[427:21.79]It was great.
[427:39.46]It was really actually fucking great.
[427:43.97]Thank you, Mosolos.
[427:46.92]Really appreciate it.
[427:49.40]Uh, anonymous cheer again came in.
[427:51.93]3, 4, 5.
[427:52.77]$5.50.
[427:52.79]Thank you.
[427:53.09]Anonymous cheer.
[427:54.97]No messages or anything.
[427:55.81]Just money dumped into the stream.
[427:58.19]Thank you.
[428:03.01]Uh, crustily bustily.
[428:05.91]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[428:07.85]Dermot, this has been one of your most thinking streams ever.
[428:10.41]Hopefully you can beat all the puzzles.
[428:12.52]This is more stressful than Amber's murder case in Hitman Absolution.
[428:16.95]So did you talk with the guy who keeps ban evasioning streams?
[428:26.23]Think about ban evasion, just gotta be careful.
[428:39.73]Joel is still at it, oh god.
[428:43.81]It's been like an hour.
[428:46.51]But no, I'll tell you, if you break the rules and you keep trying to circumvent rules, you're just going to get banned.
[428:51.31]That's what's going to happen.
[428:52.59]I'm sorry.
[428:53.17]That's the way it is.
[429:02.90]It's Joel.
[429:15.82]No, he's definitely not still.
[429:18.32]He just compared me to Sonic.
[429:19.60]Sonic's really fast.
[429:21.66]One of the most popular video game characters.
[429:25.58]Has a cool voice.
[429:31.33]I'm okay with that.
[429:31.91]That's fine.
[429:34.29]Also really small.
[429:37.13]He's not that small.
[429:38.29]Sonic the Hedgehog is tall enough.
[429:44.57]He's photoshopping movies.
[429:46.77]He's declaring war right now.
[429:52.08]Fine.
[429:52.92]I'll take a declared war.
[430:07.42]I got war.
[430:09.46]He dropped the short bomb?
[430:12.40]Okay.
[430:18.37]Planetside 2 stream, 4,000 versus 4,000.
[430:23.31]Joel versus Jerva's chat.
[430:26.69]We tried that before and it was a nightmare.
[430:36.12]We did that with like a few hundred people and we almost broke the game.
[430:42.42]Hey, Jess, you gotta thanks for the 250.
[430:44.08]I get my 50 badge after this.
[430:47.02]It's crazy how much it adds up.
[430:48.10]Here's to 50 more.
[430:50.00]It's not a lot comparatively, and I know I don't have to give you any money, but I'll give you as much as I can because I know it's going to projects for our entertainment.
[430:59.15]You're generally the best.
[430:59.97]Much love.
[431:00.51]Paintings should be done in a week or two.
[431:04.29]Thanks so much, Jess.
[431:12.58]Any amount of money that people give this channel... It means a lot.
[431:20.55]And I'm gonna try to... You know, use it for streams, use it for video stuff.
[431:31.97]You guys are incredibly generous, so thank you.
[431:34.21]Seriously.
[431:41.54]And then we had a few from MostlyLost.
[431:45.47]250-some would say this is an experiment like Twitch plays Pokémon, but it's really just a game of chicken between you and chat.
[431:59.78]Well, here's the thing.
[432:00.36]Chat cheated.
[432:02.76]And I cheated.
[432:04.20]Halfway through, you guys cheating.
[432:05.86]So is that a- I mean, it is kind of chicken, I guess.
[432:11.62]But I just played sound.
[432:12.90]You could mute the stream.
[432:14.12]That's not cheating.
[432:17.84]I was blasting fucked up sound effects.
[432:19.84]All you had to do was press the little speaker button and that was it.
[432:25.73]You guys had the full entire textbook cheat sheet.
[432:38.29]Prove that we cheated?
[432:39.81]People were spamming a link that showed every dot.
[432:46.56]I have the proof.
[432:47.66]It's already there.
[432:53.36]Yeah, you were being a dickbag.
[432:55.17]Whoa!
[432:56.71]What?
[433:01.05]I saw the... I saw it.
[433:05.56]I saw it.
[433:18.00]Oh my goodness.
[433:21.26]Thank you Creel for the five dollars, we can fill lines as well.
[433:25.90]PogChamp, PogChamp, PogChamp, PogChamp, bunch of PogChamps.
[433:32.51]Don't challenge chat without explicit rules if you're gonna change the rules.
[433:36.75]I'm sorry that don't cheat on the exam is not a given.
[433:40.99]That's not a given?
[433:44.57]Do not pull up the answer and cheat.
[433:49.96]What do you mean that's not a given?
[433:51.99]You get banned from every online multiplayer game if you cheat.
[433:55.25]If you cheat in your classroom, you're going to get detention.
[433:57.49]You're going to get your parents called in.
[434:01.23]Cheating?
[434:09.50]We used our notes that we brought.
[434:11.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[434:12.44]I don't think so.
[434:14.08]I don't think so.
[434:22.50]This is not a class- I should have named it Classroom.
[434:25.69]It's my mistake.
[434:27.45]Still gonna play Minecraft VR, it's still happening.
[434:32.17]Hey Hazy!
[434:32.79]Thanks for the five dollars, Hazy!
[434:33.95]Your latest YouTube video is a work of art.
[434:35.85]Phenomenal streamer.
[434:37.55]You can thank the two very talented editors that put those together.
[434:47.02]So, thank you, Hazy, for the $5, and thank you to Mac and Effectator for their very, very, very high-quality work.
[434:55.90]For real.
[434:57.80]Hey, Siroc, thanks for the $2.50.
[434:59.09]Sore loser.
[435:00.33]I, uh... I didn't... I'm still doing it.
[435:03.45]I'm doing Minecraft.
[435:07.61]I'm doing Minecraft.
[435:15.70]Yeah, if you guys are acting like I said, I know you cheated, therefore I'm not doing it.
[435:21.24]I'm still doing it.
[435:24.09]Yeah, fine.
[435:24.45]I'll have a cider.
[435:27.17]I will.
[435:28.07]I'm not... I can't recreate the whole thing.
[435:32.03]That takes... I'm gonna have to memorize everything.
[435:42.47]But thank you, Lightning Rider, for the 250.
[435:44.19]While the first half of the stream made me feel very uncomfortable, the second half was amazing.
[435:47.40]What happened to the first half of the stream?
[435:48.72]Am I making people uncomfortable in the first half?
[435:51.56]What did I do?
[435:52.04]Hey, Future Gamer, thanks for the 250.
[436:04.57]Recently decided to document all the major vrooms by your arch nemesis, the vroomer.
[436:11.84]Decided to clip all the big vrooms.
[436:16.06]Oh my god Are you shitting me?
[436:22.59]That's so funny Are we gonna get a vroom compilation here?
[436:35.89]I look forward to your endeavor
[436:40.73]Thank you, Future Gamer, for your contribution to the rumor.
[436:47.76]It's like bird watching.
[436:52.06]Uh, Trotter, thanks for the 250.
[436:53.50]Greetings, Mr. Streamer Man.
[436:54.56]I found the beginning of the stream to be rather amusing and decided to illustrate a short bit you did.
[436:58.44]You'll never break me.
[437:05.77]What happened to my arms?
[437:12.42]Where's my arm?
[437:12.88]Where are my fingers?
[437:19.14]Did I make a joke about me getting my arms and hands bit off or something?
[437:28.37]Get it.
[437:29.75]Get this one.
[437:35.45]That's a long one.
[437:40.64]Hey, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[437:43.27]Thanks for the 250, Garfield.
[437:44.89]Thanks to you and Mac for including me in the latest second Jerma video.
[437:47.83]It was such a shock to Garf's system.
[437:50.77]I don't know what I did to deserve such a high honor.
[437:52.41]Was it my sheer amount of Garfographs?
[437:54.41]I'm glad my dumb Rick and Morty message got read.
[437:56.59]If it means anything to you, Jerma, you'll always be Rick to me.
[438:00.05]If this gives you a leg up on the competition, tell him you have a Garfield the cat consistently donating money to you.
[438:06.88]In hindsight, that might be a disadvantage.
[438:08.92]Don't tell him.
[438:13.72]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[438:15.46]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[438:16.24]Please don't play that game again.
[438:24.03]Thank you for the $10.
[438:25.75]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[438:27.73]I never did.
[438:29.53]Where are you guys getting this from?
[438:33.09]When did I ever say I wasn't going to do Minecraft VR?
[438:38.96]You guys, you guys all in Vegas smoking weed?
[438:41.32]Did you forget?
[438:44.22]Ow.
[438:47.69]Hey, be where I live.
[438:49.15]Thanks for three bucks.
[438:49.97]By the way, thank you, but, uh, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[438:52.55]Thank you.
[438:52.97]Ten bucks.
[438:54.13]Thank you.
[438:54.41]It's a lot of money.
[438:55.95]Appreciate it.
[438:58.01]Uh, be where I live.
[438:58.79]Thanks for three bucks.
[438:59.81]Jerma, I saw your PS2 stream and I saw that you got the wrong shooter game with a real-time 12-hour timer.
[439:05.48]The game you were looking for was Winback.
[439:09.08]Damn it.
[439:10.80]I knew it existed.
[439:17.87]Uh, iKane Kling, thanks for the five bucks.
[439:20.72]I'm watching your stream on my phone and I dropped my phone in the toilet and now it's completely bricked.
[439:27.92]Worth it though, stream was a lot of fun.
[439:29.46]I'm so sorry to hear that.
[439:31.46]You gotta be careful.
[439:34.35]That's why if you're sitting down on the toilet and you're watching something on the toilet, knees together.
[439:40.55]Come on, knees together.
[439:49.05]I'm sorry for that happening, though.
[439:51.57]Thank you so much for the $5.
[439:52.31]Hopefully you can get a replacement phone.
[439:56.99]I was pissing.
[439:58.79]Oh.
[440:02.70]Oh, that sucks.
[440:03.44]I'm sorry to hear that, man.
[440:07.98]And then finally, Jack.
[440:09.18]Thank you, Jack, for the $2.50.
[440:11.97]Was that Teespring merch link legit?
[440:14.66]If it is, you should plug it.
[440:15.62]Yeah, you know it is.
[440:16.16]I have a Teespring store.
[440:18.78]Like this.
[440:19.38]Look.
[440:22.00]There it is.
[440:24.20]Now, don't fall for any of the bullshit ones.
[440:25.60]I know that, like, sometimes when you have a link, at least on Reddit or on, you know, Twitter and stuff, there's bots that come and say, oh, that one didn't work.
[440:33.26]Check out this one.
[440:34.16]This is the right link.
[440:35.00]No, no, no.
[440:35.24]It's this one.
[440:35.76]That's the only one I have.
[440:49.25]Internet's been holding up pretty well.
[440:52.43]Holy shit, there were a lot of subs.
[440:56.29]Internet's been, like, really good lately.
[440:58.47]I'm happy about it.
[440:59.07]You're gonna play Artifact?
[441:03.13]No.
[441:05.49]Let me queue up.
[441:06.35]Let's get ready to go to Joel's stream.
[441:09.17]And talk a bunch of shit, you know what I mean?
[441:21.33]But be nice about it, though.
[441:27.07]Artifact has, like, 200 players.
[441:31.23]Well, serves you right, Valve.
[441:34.05]You've got, like, four or five IPS you could make games on that people are so desperately waiting for.
[441:39.38]And you make a card game five years late.
[441:45.62]Come on.
[441:47.90]That might be... Call me rude, but seriously...
[441:52.06]Who wanted Artifact?
[441:52.92]Nobody wanted that game.
[441:55.60]Take any franchise that Valve has.
[441:59.08]Any of them.
[441:59.62]I don't care which one.
[442:00.42]Ricochet 2 would be more well-received.
[442:10.17]You got so many great franchises.
[442:11.61]I mean, what is it?
[442:13.32]Is it just the Dota 2 thing?
[442:15.54]There's a shitload of Dota 2 players?
[442:18.40]And look what happened.
[442:19.82]The auto-chest comes out.
[442:21.12]They scooped that fucking whole thing up.
[442:32.93]I'm not even talking about their main staple frame.
[442:37.04]Wasn't Left 4 Dead 3 in development for like six years or seven years or something?
[442:42.32]I thought there was a Left 4 Dead 3 leak like four and a half years ago.
[442:48.36]What happened to that?
[442:58.36]They just- they cancelled it.
[442:59.40]Oh.
[443:05.36]That auto-chess game actually looks pretty fun.
[443:14.32]I don't know a damn thing about it, but it just looks interesting.
[443:16.53]Looks like the old school Warcraft 3 mods.
[443:26.11]Remember when you were playing Metal Gear and you said you hated us?
[443:28.17]I do.
[443:28.97]I don't remember an apology.
[443:30.07]No, you're taking me out of context.
[443:31.07]I never said that.
[443:31.59]I love you guys.
[443:38.59]I mean, the thing is, I could... We can talk about Valve.
[443:41.39]Valve, why do you make no games, Valve?
[443:43.73]What the heck?
[443:44.27]What the hell?
[443:46.07]They did have a lot to do with the Vive.
[443:51.01]I mean, the Vive... The hardware, the Vive is just... It's great.
[443:55.04]I know it's HTC, but they had a lot to do with it, didn't they?
[444:02.62]Didn't... Valve didn't have anything to do with the Vive?
[444:08.43]I thought that they were a part of the... So, I mean, you could talk shit about, where is TF3?
[444:18.30]They've been doing other stuff.
[444:20.12]Just video games are not what they're even up into anymore, at all.
[444:28.14]They got the Steam, they got the business stuff all locked down completely.
[444:37.72]Yeah, Valve's not the only company with issues.
[444:39.36]No, and I'm just saying it as a salty fucking asshole.
[444:44.72]I would say the same shit about Blizzard.
[444:45.98]I, like, loved all their games.
[444:49.34]All Blizzard games, all Valve games.
[444:51.08]Oh my god, this is amazing.
[444:52.10]I can't wait to see what they do next.
[444:54.93]So I am just a salty... E-asshole, you know what I mean?
[445:02.43]Stuck in the past.
[445:09.04]But that's going to be it.
[445:09.76]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[445:11.58]Starting, you know, that same window between 3 and 4 p.m.
