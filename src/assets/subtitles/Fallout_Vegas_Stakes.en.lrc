[ve:60.16.100]

[02:06.98]So I'm opening up my Fallout New Vegas game.
[02:12.32]And there seems to be a problem with my last saves.
[02:16.15]They're not loading.
[02:16.99]I hope my entire game is not corrupted from all the nonsense we did a few weeks ago.
[02:25.24]If that's the case, then that sure is gonna be a downer.
[02:29.64]Gonna have to load, like, two hours previously, probably.
[02:32.64]Because the last time I played the game, we crashed at the casino.
[02:36.63]That's the last thing I remember.
[02:41.57]Give me a minute here, guys.
[02:42.87]I'm gonna try to figure this out.
[02:52.17]Boom, boom.
[02:55.15]If I can't play it, I should buy and play Fallout 1.
[03:02.77]I should have backed up the files.
[03:03.85]I didn't know I was going to need to back up the files.
[03:05.29]Alright, let's load.
[03:05.93]Okay, there's a quick save in here.
[03:10.04]I don't even know if it's going to bring me anywhere.
[03:16.42]Looking at our loading.
[03:17.14]Oh, yes, it worked.
[03:20.26]It worked, boys and girls.
[03:21.58]You just need to
[03:25.19]Oh, dear.
[03:25.92]What have I done?
[03:27.50]Hey, look at that.
[03:30.16]We did it.
[03:31.20]We're safe.
[03:32.92]I just need to remember how to play the game.
[03:36.36]Wait, that guy went to the ground.
[03:42.57]Yeah, you did clip through the sorry ass.
[03:46.75]I think we're good.
[03:49.13]I hope we're good.
[03:52.78]Was it?
[03:53.10]Hopefully.
[03:53.40]Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
[03:54.42]Alright, well, how do you take out a gun?
[03:56.28]How much money do I have?
[04:01.97]$1,700.
[04:02.15]Yeah, I made a shitload of money.
[04:03.29]Alright, let's play some roulette.
[04:04.83]Let's start it off with some roulette.
[04:10.05]Alright, what do we got?
[04:12.13]You thought I was going to play New Vegas?
[04:13.63]No, this is just a betting stream.

[04:22.87]And I won a thousand dollars.
[04:26.31]I won a thousand dollars on an Ellen DeGeneres slot machine.
[04:31.20]Abbot J, thanks for three months.
[04:32.48]My sleep schedule can't take these streams.
[04:35.86]Well, hopefully we can fix that.

[07:42.19]Double down.

[08:17.26]I thought this table was just upside down.
[08:18.50]Alright, like, I'm getting out of here.
[08:19.98]This is gonna be a real boring fucking stream if I just sit here and play slots.
[08:26.24]Is there a slot machine that actually works, though?
[08:27.73]That'd be nice.
[08:31.39]Oh, my gods.
[08:32.29]Can you sit in the fucking stool, please?
[08:37.20]What the hell?
[08:37.72]Save, scum.
[08:39.72]I just doubled down on 18.
[08:40.42]Come on.
[08:41.14]Like, I have to save that state.
[08:50.87]Look.
[08:51.09]Oh, gay guys.
[08:53.37]Nice casino you got here.
[08:55.15]What a fantastic fucking establishment.
[08:57.47]You have 60 slots and only two of them work.
[09:02.37]You gotta be shitting me.
[09:06.54]Somebody needs to plug these back in.
[09:11.64]Spin it.
[09:17.42]Spin it.
[09:20.39]Come on, give me triple cherry.
[09:32.92]That's where the fucking jackpot... Whoa.
[09:34.73]What's this guy?
[09:35.23]Two steaks?
[09:35.81]Fucking game crashed!
[09:37.03]No!
[09:53.58]A game crash?
[09:54.28]I just got two free steaks and the game crashed.
[09:56.35]Are you serious?
[10:00.23]What the fuck?
[10:04.53]It hit something on the house.
[10:05.91]A fucking game crash.
[10:09.75]Oh, that sucks such ass.
[10:11.69]Okay, great.
[10:13.35]I guess that's what I deserve.
[10:22.38]I just had like 5,000 chips.
[10:26.80]Alright, well, hold on.
[10:27.95]We're gonna use the theory of relativity here, guys.
[10:29.89]The theory of Einstein's theory of relativity.
[10:34.37]If I do every single thing I just did from that save state, I have to do everything exact.
[10:42.17]It should happen again, right?
[10:43.92]So, I walked around.
[10:45.10]Don't worry, I got this.
[10:48.54]Just have to do every single thing exactly to the T to retrace all my steps.
[11:05.59]Great.
[11:08.53]That's great.
[11:09.80]I don't think this is going to work now.
[11:13.90]Hey, thanks for coming, guys.
[11:17.68]We had a great time streaming.
[11:19.83]Fallout New Vegas.
[11:22.69]Yeah.
[11:23.95]Yeah.
[11:35.00]All I did is just win it at a slot machine.
[11:37.00]And now I can't even play Fallout New Vegas.
[11:39.15]What the fuck?
[11:45.57]So that save doesn't work now.
[11:47.49]So I have two corrupted saves.
[11:50.13]So how far back do we have to go?
[11:59.67]Is... Are we gonna have to go back before I get in the casino?
[12:04.17]I can't retrace those steps.
[12:05.29]I have no idea what I even did.
[12:06.67]Let's try this again.
[12:14.83]It's a feature.
[12:15.51]Okay.
[12:19.83]Come on.
[12:21.13]How much further back do I have to go?
[12:24.74]Load.
[12:26.16]That was the save.
[12:27.34]This is the auto-save, which also didn't work.
[12:35.71]Alright guys, well, you ready to go back five hours in-game?
[12:38.87]This is the last save I have before that.
[12:45.02]It's over.
[12:46.26]It's over.
[12:46.66]I hope this loads.
[12:48.84]Come on!
[12:49.40]Come on!
[12:55.18]Yes!
[12:56.14]Thank God.
[12:56.84]Okay, I gotta retrace my steps.
[12:59.93]Uh, what did I do?
[13:00.49]Which one of these work?
[13:06.21]What the fuck?
[13:09.89]Sit down.
[13:10.55]Sit in the seat.
[13:14.05]How the fuck do you work these?
[13:16.71]I can't use the slots?
[13:20.07]Wow, great casino.
[13:21.49]Awesome casino.
[13:22.93]They have 60 slot machines and only fucking two of them work?
[13:27.99]Ridiculous.
[13:29.11]Maybe you should plug them back in.
[13:30.71]Increase the bets.
[13:33.71]Max bet.
[13:35.66]Alright, spin it.
[13:43.09]Alright, that's the same outcome.
[13:44.93]Good.
[13:45.81]1,200 chips.
[13:47.67]Here comes the steaks.
[13:48.41]Yeah, thanks a lot for the two steaks.
[13:51.80]Appreciate it.
[13:52.72]Alright.
[13:53.86]Save this game.
[14:00.22]Nice.
[14:01.08]It worked.
[14:02.97]Business is good.
[14:04.45]All the family's got money.
[14:06.03]It worked.
[14:09.83]We beat the system.
[14:13.24]Wait, what?
[14:15.26]Hey, Twitchy Dove.
[14:16.78]Thanks for four months.
[14:17.48]Now I gotta move this again.

[14:19.68]I'm just gonna go back to fucking... I'm gonna go back to working at Walgreens like I said I was gonna do.
[14:27.10]Twitchy Dove for four months.
[14:28.44]Thank you, Twitchy Dove.
[14:31.74]Thank you so goddamn much.
[14:36.86]I don't even know where I'm supposed to be going.
[14:38.36]All I know is that I'm supposed to be, should I just keep winning money?
[14:44.21]Should I cash out?
[14:44.97]Yeah, I'll cash out.
[14:46.95]I'd like to exchange my chips.
[14:56.65]I wanted caps.
[14:57.79]Caps.

[15:14.34]That is a lot.
[15:14.62]Why am I in this fight mode?
[15:27.52]Where are my weapons?
[15:31.22]Wait, oh, they take your weapons, don't they?
[15:32.84]How do I get them back?
[15:35.90]Oh, shit.
[15:36.78]Boys!
[15:38.94]We just found the strip club.
[15:43.17]Easy Pete says he once found a real good claim out east by the river.
[15:47.09]I say he's dead.
[15:49.19]Oh, regardless, thank you, Errolis.

[16:05.72]Where's the dance button?
[16:13.94]It's a fucking dork.
[16:19.78]Oh, it's a real snooze fest.
[16:22.09]Why are you the only guy here?
[16:24.65]Where's everybody else?
[16:27.08]I'm telling you, if I'm in your position, I ain't gonna sit here.
[16:30.20]The one guy at, like, the strip club.
[16:31.90]At that point, you're the weirdo.
[16:32.94]You gotta get out of here, dude.
[16:33.86]Go, like, stand over there and, like, talk to somebody.
[16:36.66]Give me that, too.
[16:37.54]Welcome to the strip club.
[16:38.38]Find out how easy Pete became so very easy.
[16:43.43]Thanks a lot, KJ.
[16:43.85]KJ8011 for two months.
[16:44.53]And I can't... Can I not go in here?
[16:55.12]Gamora is always open for business.
[17:00.75]Hey there, can I get you a drink?
[17:02.31]Yeah.
[17:03.45]Oh man, I'm looking for... Let me see what you got.
[17:06.09]Fuck off.
[17:12.10]What about you?
[17:22.05]You have this wicked weird chicken hair right now.
[17:23.95]I need to see this.
[17:25.55]What is going on with your chicken hair?
[17:28.91]Is that her hair?
[17:30.31]It is, isn't it?
[17:31.85]This is freaking me out.
[17:32.65]Is she wearing a bird nest on her head?
[17:37.83]Oh, it's a hat.
[17:40.65]That is a bird's nest.
[17:41.97]Oh, wow, cool.
[17:46.83]Get a fucking slot machine.
[17:49.23]Oh, I don't have any more chips.
[17:53.69]So, where do I need to actually go?
[17:54.93]That was the question.
[17:55.81]The only thing I remember is the last catastrophe of a stream we did.
[18:01.99]I got a lot of money.
[18:02.77]It's time to go.
[18:05.49]Where is that, by the way?
[18:06.78]Where is that?
[18:07.42]Where do I need to go?
[18:11.42]Alright, there's, like, the IP address.
[18:12.74]I just need to, like, get there, right?
[18:17.68]Uh, HUD data...
[18:20.05]Okay.
[18:20.69]Well, I guess I do have to be here, don't I?
[18:23.08]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[18:24.28]Search the strip for the man who shot you.
[18:26.06]Somebody shot me?
[18:29.56]Somebody shot me with a gun?
[18:30.84]When?
[18:31.94]Is this the Topps Casino?
[18:33.02]I have no idea where I am.
[18:33.76]It's been like three weeks since I last played this.
[18:35.36]I'm just going to keep going this way.
[18:38.60]This seems to be going in the right direction.
[18:40.44]This guy has all my stuff, right?
[18:41.44]I tell you, there's some serious shit going on between NCR and the Legion.
[18:46.32]You better not fuck with our power.
[18:48.48]Where do I get my items back?
[18:49.92]Hello and welcome.
[18:55.03]Didn't this guy take all my weapons?
[18:57.89]What the fuck are you looking at?
[19:03.15]I hope I have my weapons back.
[19:07.73]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[19:10.23]Okay, I got them back, good.
[19:13.81]Was I using pool cue?
[19:15.23]Wait, what?
[19:17.69]What was I using?
[19:18.49]Maybe it was a pool cue.
[19:26.50]Remember the opening cinematic you skipped?
[19:28.50]The plot is you're looking for the guy that shot you in the head.
[19:31.16]Oh, right.
[19:34.06]God, I'm just like, don't tell him what they think.
[19:35.40]Alright, let's go.
[19:40.52]Don't walk away.
[19:41.96]Let me show you the time.
[19:43.77]Check my moves, honey.
[19:46.84]I'm trying to press E. You like space cowboy Donatello look-a-likes?
[19:52.85]I do too.
[19:56.51]Alright, bye.
[20:03.03]I'm in the real shady, seedy part of town.
[20:06.43]Am I going the right way?
[20:10.90]I gotta find the guy that shot me in the head.
[20:14.70]Easy enough.
[20:17.07]Right there, baby.
[20:18.63]Right there.
[20:26.97]And then we go over here.
[20:28.39]It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you.
[20:30.47]Last night some girls... It's hard to sleep in this place, you see?
[20:33.17]It's crazy.
[20:34.45]I don't like this.
[20:36.07]I would not want to go in here.
[20:36.93]This place hurts my head.
[20:37.69]Oh, this guy's drunk.
[20:38.97]Talk to the drunk.
[20:40.41]You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
[20:45.58]Hey, welcome aboard.
[20:47.98]For somebody that's this drunk, you're having a really easy time talking.
[20:51.22]Yeah, his walking is not matching his talking.
[20:54.44]He should be slurring way more than that.
[20:57.46]What about suit guy?
[20:58.96]Okay, well, I gotta go in here, right?
[21:17.78]Yeah.
[21:19.50]Right?
[21:20.71]Yeah, Topps Casino.
[21:26.19]Hey, fella!
[21:26.61]Even my pool cue?
[21:35.61]From my cold, dead hands.
[21:38.79]Okay.
[21:39.49]Smooth and easy, just the way I like it.
[21:42.23]Oh, and a friendly word of advice.
[21:44.11]If you happen to stumble across any weapons during your stay here, well, just don't wear them openly.
[21:49.52]You dig?
[21:49.86]What the hell does that mean?
[21:50.68]Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your top... Um, so I can find guns in here?
[21:59.81]And he's like, don't worry about it, I guess?
[22:01.25]Hey, there's the high roll.
[22:02.45]How's it hangin'?
[22:04.01]See, they call me the High Roller now.
[22:06.31]That's awesome.
[22:06.91]I get to be the High Roller.
[22:09.51]Yeah, you know that's me.
[22:11.60]You know how much money I won on the Ellen DeGeneres fucking machine in the other casino?
[22:17.26]A shitload.
[22:18.92]Do they have an Ellen DeGeneres machine here?
[22:24.94]The cat's gone mad.
[22:28.82]Find Benny and destroy him.
[22:30.82]Thanks a lot Zack and Flex- Zack IDFK and FlexRetro.
[22:37.51]Should we go- maybe another slot machine.
[22:39.29]One for good luck.
[22:40.89]I fucking hate that you have to buy chips.
[22:45.79]I'm glad to see you.
[22:46.63]Uh, gotta go this way?
[22:54.59]That way.
[22:59.05]Cashier's office upstairs.
[23:02.33]No.
[23:03.57]This way.
[23:07.63]The entire game is just a Topps advertisement.
[23:09.46]So I gotta go over here?
[23:16.78]No, is there a guy over here?
[23:21.14]What in the goddamn?
[23:23.36]Let's keep this in the groove, hey?
[23:25.36]Smooth move, smooth.
[23:27.45]Is this the guy?
[23:28.23]Hello.
[23:30.05]The guy everyone saw go in the lucky 30 minutes was you?
[23:33.79]Oh, shit.
[23:39.55]This is the guy who shot me.
[23:40.49]Okay.
[23:40.91]Give me one good reason not to kill you.
[23:42.05]You want a reason?
[23:43.29]How about four?
[23:43.87]Give me four reasons.
[23:44.77]They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing.
[23:47.54]Me too.
[23:47.96]So baby makes five.
[23:49.64]Oh, wow, you're so scary.
[23:50.74]The chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some holdout pea shooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
[23:55.78]Okay.
[23:57.04]Anyhow, baby.
[23:58.26]Don't call me baby.
[23:59.22]Don't fucking ever call me baby.
[24:02.09]What say you and me cash out?
[24:03.99]Go somewhere that's more private-like.
[24:06.01]Any questions you got, I'll answer.
[24:10.77]He just told me he was surrounded by bodyguards and now he's saying let's go somewhere alone.
[24:14.88]Do you just want me to just slit your throat in a hotel room?
[24:20.00]What are you talking about?
[24:21.46]What do you have in mind?
[24:22.10]Presidential?
[24:23.56]Oh, man.
[24:23.84]Okay.
[24:23.94]Okay.
[24:24.04]Alright.
[24:24.74]Fuck, I'm not that high.
[24:25.74]Why don't you know?
[24:41.63]Why don't you, you know, help me if I barter?
[24:43.66]The suite's a nice touch, but someone's gotta pay off my contract.
[24:46.78]Barter 35.
[24:47.04]Yeah.
[24:47.16]We got a future together.
[24:48.16]We got a future together.
[24:50.04]Oh, let's go to the presidential suite.
[24:51.90]I'm waiting for this guy.
[24:53.22]I'm gonna hide in the closet and I'm going to fucking beat the shit out of his head with a fucking tire iron.
[25:14.58]Alright, let's go to the presidential suite.
[25:18.52]Hey, presidential suite.
[25:19.95]Looks pretty nice.
[25:20.89]All the free booze one could want.
[25:24.05]Thank you.
[25:24.69]I will take it.
[25:27.99]And I will take your weird fucking alien fruits, too.
[25:30.77]And your cups.
[25:32.30]And your pool cues.
[25:34.82]Big mistake.
[25:36.48]Big fucking mistake leaving a pool cue in here.
[25:38.80]You know I'm a melee soldier.
[25:40.20]What else we got?
[25:42.30]Give me the triangle.
[25:44.03]Give me the sofa.
[25:45.51]For a second I thought I was gonna take the sofa.
[25:51.53]How funny would it be if the sofa just disappeared?
[25:57.03]Is this my suite?
[25:59.19]This guy's so dead.
[26:00.61]I gotta save it right here.
[26:03.73]This guy is fucked.
[26:06.23]He's gonna come up here and negotiate with me.
[26:07.85]He doesn't know he's gonna get a pool cue shoved up his ass.
[26:12.01]And I'm gonna be shit-faced when I do it, too.
[26:13.77]All this free drinks.
[26:17.44]What is that?
[26:17.84]Chips?
[26:20.28]Somebody just left chips here.
[26:25.36]This place is loaded.
[26:26.26]Oh my god, this is amazing.
[26:28.31]This is gonna be so awesome.
[26:29.77]Let's fucking chug them.
[26:32.47]What do I do?
[26:39.19]Alright, I'm ready.
[26:40.89]I am ready for this guy.
[26:44.03]Is there a grenade?
[26:44.57]Do I have any grenades?
[26:46.73]Please tell me somebody left a grenade in here.
[26:48.45]Wait, what?
[26:51.47]Why do I think that's so funny?
[26:54.40]Welcome back, Kirinth.
[26:55.62]Sup, bro.
[26:56.20]Thanks for four months, Kirinth.
[26:58.38]You're about to watch me throw a grenade at a guy.
[27:01.30]Oh, I think I hear him.
[27:14.41]As sweet as yours, you're stealing from yourself.
[27:16.61]No, I'm stealing from him because I'm going to kill him and run away.
[27:18.87]Take it all.
[27:23.59]Give me all this, man.
[27:24.53]This is crazy.
[27:25.23]Fresh apples.
[27:26.91]Fresh cranberries.
[27:30.77]Alright.
[27:31.79]I'm supposed to meet him in here?
[27:32.77]How long is it going to take?
[27:33.97]Ring-a-ding.
[27:38.09]Search Benny's room in the Tops for clues.
[27:40.99]Talk to Mr. Howe.
[27:41.83]Spread word of Legion atrocities.
[27:43.15]I mean... Confront Benny at Tops Casino.
[27:46.19]Or search Benny's room?
[27:47.89]Should I just wait for him?
[27:49.71]Didn't he say he was going to come say hello to me?
[27:50.99]Alright, I'll sleep in the bed for an hour.
[27:55.76]He should be here now, right?
[27:59.42]Get all the complimentary soaps and towels.
[28:03.18]Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
[28:03.98]Where's the shower?
[28:07.32]They always load them up with nice shampoos.
[28:09.92]Body lotions.
[28:10.68]Drinking out of the toilet again.
[28:15.07]Okay, I'm ready.
[28:25.11]How do I get them up here?
[28:30.25]Nope.
[28:30.75]I mean, no show.
[28:31.57]Oh, okay.
[28:31.83]Where is he talking from?
[28:33.87]Is he on the other side?
[28:34.87]Just run through!
[28:35.51]He's sitting on the other side of this wall with the intercom, right?
[28:38.62]So what if I just sprint through the door?
[28:41.12]I'll get him, right?
[29:00.34]Well, hold on.
[29:00.90]I've got very high charisma here.
[29:02.90]I've got really high barter and charisma.
[29:05.48]Let's talk it through.
[29:07.56]Okay.
[29:11.10]Speed 35.
[29:11.30]There it is.
[29:13.56]This is what I put all the points in it for, guys.
[29:16.18]Hmm.
[29:16.36]Hmm.
[29:27.69]Speech 50.
[29:28.39]Fuck off, mate.
[29:30.19]I dig your line.
[29:30.89]Let me fucking live.
[29:31.55]You'll never see me again.
[29:32.39]Mm-hmm.
[29:33.77]Get him.
[29:35.05]Where's he?
[29:35.37]Where'd he go?
[29:53.90]I won.
[29:55.34]You guys thought I was all dead.
[29:56.55]I just won the game right now.
[29:58.83]I talked my way out of it.
[30:00.65]What else is new?
[30:01.27]He's gonna find his room.
[30:05.81]Hopefully he's in his room sleeping and I can just bury this into his head.
[30:09.81]Wait, what?
[30:12.94]Captain Narwhal, six months, and a fucking bug's crawling on me.
[30:16.94]Hold on a second.
[30:19.74]What is with this basement and bugs?
[30:22.10]Get these bugs out of here.
[30:24.67]Tommy Tortellini, what's this guy's name?
[30:27.91]Hey, hey, welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas.
[30:34.15]Appreciate it, Benny.
[30:35.73]Dig it, baby.
[30:36.95]He beat feet to his sweet.
[30:38.54]Oh, he's in his sweet.
[30:39.18]You're the big boss man or something.
[30:41.56]Oh my God, bye.
[30:42.82]I don't care what you have to say.
[30:43.78]Just point me in the direction to go to his personal quarters.
[30:55.15]You guys ever heard of the one about the two peanuts that were walking down the street?
[31:00.71]One of them was assaulted.
[31:02.09]A priest or a rabbi and a priest go to a bar and they sit down to have a drink.
[31:13.58]Bartender says, which one of you guys left the horse outside?
[31:16.96]The rabbi says, Clahiam.
[31:23.47]You're a great crowd.
[31:25.56]Where the fuck do I go?
[31:31.23]I gotta go.
[31:31.69]I went the wrong way.
[31:34.91]Get off the stage.
[31:40.41]I gotta go find Benjamin.
[31:43.67]I think he's this way.
[31:47.15]Boo.
[31:49.91]Come on.
[31:50.33]I was doing my stand-up routine.
[31:52.15]You guys know how funny that is.
[31:54.15]Wait.
[31:54.88]What?
[31:55.95]Super relevant game, Jeremiah.
[31:58.03]Yeah, it is.
[31:59.33]It is a relevant game.
[32:01.39]Fallout Vegas Vacation.
[32:04.03]But thank you for real do.
[32:08.35]For real do.
[32:09.65]25.
[32:10.31]Two months.
[32:12.07]You're going to get the special occasion here of watching me bury a pool cue into Benny's head.
[32:17.55]Why did it take me that long to say that?
[32:21.41]Hey, guys.
[32:23.27]How are you?
[32:24.57]Nice to see you.
[32:26.93]I'll be taking my leave now.
[32:28.31]Oh, I gotta take out the bodyguards.
[32:30.57]Okay.
[32:32.41]So if memory serves me right, there's two bodyguards behind me.
[32:35.99]One to my left, one to my right.
[32:39.09]If I can be fast enough, I can take them all out in less than one second flat.
[32:44.91]I need to remember my training.
[32:47.23]Remember your training.
[32:52.39]Don't get too close to me.
[32:53.77]I wonder what Benny ran off to.
[33:04.22]It's fucking easy.
[33:07.02]What is this guy?
[33:12.19]I need to save.
[33:16.23]Wait, what?
[33:17.43]Save, save.
[33:18.67]I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
[33:22.67]Okay, I saved it.
[33:24.61]And that was Sprigwar reminding me.
[33:26.60]Thank you.
[33:27.10]Four months, dude.
[33:27.68]Welcome back.
[33:29.26]Top joke.
[33:29.92]Where's Benny?
[33:30.24]Thanks for... Okay.
[33:31.12]Thank you so much, dude.
[33:32.38]Ring-a-ding-ding.
[33:55.05]Benny stole from me No
[34:08.26]I can't take this seriously.
[34:09.34]This is like Spongebob is telling me a very serious story.
[34:13.06]That's just a guess, though.
[34:14.69]The chip's a proprietary format.
[34:17.17]You need special hardware to read the data on.
[34:19.83]There are two locations with non-standard hardware on the network.
[34:23.19]The Lucky 38 and an underground facility at Fortification Hill.
[34:27.57]I'd look there!
[34:28.52]Thanks.
[34:30.20]I'll go there.
[34:30.70]What are you doing here, by the way?
[34:34.02]Good question!
[34:38.61]PDQ88B.
[34:44.88]I'm leaving.
[34:46.28]How do I walk away from a conversation?
[34:48.54]This guy sucks.
[34:52.26]Penny reprogrammed him.
[34:53.72]Okay, goodbye.
[34:56.36]Late.
[34:58.26]We gotta get our speech up to 60, I think.
[35:01.22]I've seen a couple of 60s.
[35:04.59]Melee weapons.
[35:05.93]Barter.
[35:06.47]Lockpick.
[35:09.29]Science.
[35:10.49]Melee weapons.
[35:11.19]Get 73.
[35:12.11]Continue.
[35:18.17]This guy sucks.
[35:19.27]No.
[35:19.47]What do we got down here?
[35:22.93]Super slam.
[35:24.13]All melee weapons and unarmed attacks have a chance to knock your target down.
[35:27.21]That's pretty cool.
[35:29.73]Scrounger.
[35:30.29]Quickdraw.
[35:30.83]Commando.
[35:37.71]I think I'm gonna do Super Slam.
[35:45.49]Yeah, Super Slam.
[35:46.69]Is that the only one I can do?
[35:48.93]Yeah, Super Slam, give it to me.
[35:57.09]Let's give it a test, why don't you say it guys?
[36:00.41]Test it out on this fucking cartoon character.
[36:02.71]And he won't even know if I'm behind, right in the back of his fucking head.
[36:13.25]It worked.
[36:13.57]He fell down.
[36:14.05]Okay, bye.
[36:26.88]That was fun.
[36:28.74]What was with my face, too?
[36:30.32]I have a really weird face.
[36:34.35]Alright, new quest.
[36:35.87]It's got to go to 70.
[36:36.67]Soldier: 76, right?
[36:39.11]Talk to Mr. House at the Lucky 38.
[36:41.19]Go that way.
[36:45.96]Talk to Yes Man about how to take over Vegas.
[36:48.58]Okay.
[36:50.46]How do I take over Las Vegas?
[36:51.48]So, he wants to kill Dr. House.
[37:03.15]I was programmed to be helpful and answer any questions I was asked.
[37:07.11]I guess nobody bothered to restrict who I answer questions for.
[37:10.75]That was probably pretty dumb, huh?
[37:13.43]That is pretty dumb.
[37:15.21]What if I wanted to take over New Vegas?
[37:17.18]Then I'd have to help you.
[37:18.76]I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't want me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no.
[37:23.24]Oh, alright.
[37:25.53]Let's do it.
[37:25.99]That's what we're doing then.
[37:27.65]That's easy.
[37:28.03]Okay.
[37:28.23]So... Say Mr. House was going to suffer an accident.
[37:29.97]How would that happen?
[37:56.22]It makes me feel really dumb to admit this, but I don't actually know.
[38:01.64]I've never been inside the Lucky 38.
[38:04.02]No one has.
[38:05.06]Mr. House is in there, though.
[38:06.94]It's the central... He's definitely a computer.
[38:10.88]You have?
[38:11.66]Wow, that's amazing.
[38:13.62]You can murder Mr. House whenever you want.
[38:16.26]I mean, Benny was always scheming about how he would... Inky, welcome back for four months.
[38:20.83]Love you, dude.
[38:21.75]Hey, love you, dude.
[38:22.69]Thanks a lot, man.
[38:23.75]Wait, what?
[38:27.76]And then write it back to back, back to back, back.
[38:29.94]Oh, two love yous back to back.
[38:32.00]Wow.
[38:33.66]Dead prisoner.
[38:35.04]Thanks for four months as well.
[38:38.17]Okay.
[38:38.43]Yada, yada, yada.
[38:40.19]Goodbye.
[38:40.59]I don't like talking.
[38:43.93]I'm a man of action, not a man of words.
[38:46.41]You know what I'm saying?
[38:51.96]Talk to Mr. House at Lucky 38.
[38:53.10]Oh, okay.
[38:54.02]Wildcard sidebecks.
[38:56.38]So this is Brotherhood of Steel.
[38:57.88]These are all the different factions.
[38:59.12]Okay.
[39:01.24]Cover the platinum chip from Benny at the fort.
[39:03.84]Kill or disable Mr. House.
[39:05.18]Okay, so should I... Kill Mr. House and go take over Las Vegas?
[39:09.79]Or should I talk to Mr. House?
[39:10.91]I don't know.
[39:15.23]That's why your speech is set to 60.
[39:19.89]Oh yeah, that's right.
[39:20.63]I forgot.
[39:23.50]We're gonna go check out Doctor House.
[39:25.98]We'll see.
[39:26.84]I'll determine if I'm gonna kill him or not when I get there.
[39:30.68]A man of action, not a man of words.
[39:32.84]Your speech is 60.
[39:33.96]Seems like pretty dumb, doesn't it?
[39:40.97]Oh.
[39:42.39]This is a seerah.
[39:47.37]Anything in here?
[39:48.07]What's this?
[39:48.91]Locksmith reader?
[39:49.63]Okay, fine.
[39:52.88]I think this was a success.
[39:54.28]What do you guys think?
[39:55.04]I got a free hotel room.
[39:56.82]I got a bunch of free booze.
[40:00.78]I got a sweet deal.
[40:02.74]He gave me 500 bucks.
[40:04.60]Whoa, should I have to leave?
[40:05.42]Do you think they'd remember that I came in here?
[40:10.14]I wonder.
[40:10.48]What does it say?
[40:12.87]Is it F5?
[40:13.09]Alright, let's see if these guys remember that I came in here.
[40:24.06]You guys are fucking idiots.
[40:31.89]What a bunch of dummies.
[40:36.52]So we gotta go to 38.
[40:37.12]Lucky 38 studios.
[40:51.85]What happens if I just smash one of these?
[40:53.58]Does it shoot chips out?
[40:59.45]If it gets suspicious, just lie down in the grenade room.
[41:01.97]That's a good idea.
[41:10.39]I so badly want to spawn a Deathclaw right now, but no, we have to play the game.
[41:15.23]We have to play the game.
[41:17.99]What am I doing?
[41:18.47]The eyes of the mighty Kaisar are upon you.
[41:21.46]Kaisar?
[41:21.84]He admires your accomplishments and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his mark.
[41:27.22]Any crimes you may have perpetrated against the Legion are hereby forgiven.
[41:31.42]What is this guy talking about?
[41:33.70]Is this guy on drugs?
[41:35.58]My lord requires your presence at his camp at Fortification Hill.
[41:39.32]Stop snorting speed, dude.
[41:41.37]It's not going to do good for your kidneys.
[41:43.15]Incidentally, it will interest you to know that the man you seek is- Wait, what?
[41:47.81]And is likely making haste for Kaisar's camp as we speak.
[41:51.35]Don't get too close to Mr. Penny.
[41:53.63]Thanks a lot, Googly Gareth.
[41:56.73]You again.
[41:57.17]Have I seen this guy before?
[41:58.15]I don't... If this is a trap, I'm gonna take a lot of you with me.
[42:06.02]That's what I'm telling him.
[42:06.70]Oh, we got a sick bowtie, dude.
[42:08.22]That's a really sick gingerbread man bowtie that you bit the head off of.
[42:26.53]How am I over-encumbered?
[42:28.70]I didn't pick anything up.
[42:33.12]Oh, hold on.

[44:07.95]Get me out of here.
[44:11.13]I made a joke about his tie.
[44:12.20]That looks like a gingerbread man.
[44:13.70]With the head bitten off.
[44:18.98]Okay, so what am I doing for now?
[44:28.70]Local map.
[44:30.38]Alright, New Vegas Strip.
[44:33.25]This is the marker I currently have for... Okay, lucky 38.
[44:38.31]I'll just go do that.
[44:39.59]Forget about this dumbass.
[44:40.47]I don't care about this guy.
[44:50.92]There it is.
[44:52.18]Lucky 38.
[44:55.94]More flashing lights.
[44:58.49]Well, howdy, partner.
[44:59.55]Good to see you again.
[45:01.83]Boss is waiting for you upstairs, so get a move on.
[45:05.96]Okay.
[45:08.98]Do I know this guy?
[45:14.52]Who is this?
[45:15.08]Is this the... I've been here before?
[45:18.41]I don't remember ever being here.
[45:22.53]I don't remember coming into this place.
[45:24.25]Apparently I've been here before.
[45:28.80]Let's go.
[45:31.52]Where to, partner?
[45:34.36]Get me to the penthouse.
[45:38.51]Penthouse floor.
[45:42.55]Oh, shit.
[45:45.37]I didn't know that Lucky 38 was Adolf Hitler.
[45:48.83]I know where we... This takes place in World War II, doesn't it?
[45:53.67]I have to go back in time and I have to assassinate Hitler.
[45:56.03]That's why I'm here.
[46:02.00]Oh no, his mustache is... No, that's not him.
[46:03.48]Okay, never mind.
[46:05.72]Save it.
[46:06.06]Save it!
[46:22.58]This guy's scary.
[46:25.62]Oh, no.
[46:25.76]Uh...
[46:48.29]You sent me up for an ambush!
[46:49.63]And whose idea was it to offer yourself up as a sacrificial lamb?
[46:53.81]Really, what did you expect?
[46:55.97]Are you going to keep giving him opportunities to kill you?
[46:59.04]It's becoming a hobby of his.
[47:06.32]Where do you go?
[47:07.26]His destination is hardly a mystery.
[47:09.99]See?
[47:10.07]It's Caesar, not Kaiser.
[47:11.31]That guy kept saying Kaiser.
[47:12.27]It's not like a dinner roll.
[47:14.21]What do I do next?
[47:15.24]Okay.
[47:38.29]Do I have to kill Caesar?
[47:40.59]Who am I, Brutus?
[47:43.74]Well, he's dead.
[47:45.20]He's dead.
[47:45.44]Alright, bye.
[47:45.72]I'm gonna go.
[47:46.02]Imagine them rampaging across the strip.
[48:03.35]We have a chance to see them destroyed.
[48:05.87]To see New Vegas become the harbinger of... I don't like this guy's face.
[48:19.89]He looks too content.
[48:22.57]Alright, I'll do what you want, Dr. House.
[48:24.17]I expect that if Benny doesn't have the chip, Caesar will make sure you get it.
[48:28.38]More on that later.
[48:29.68]Be off.
[48:33.78]He's in the computer.
[48:35.02]He's inside the computer.
[48:35.98]I don't have any grenades.
[48:41.85]I'm torching this computer.
[48:43.51]He lives inside of it.
[48:44.77]He is the computer.
[48:45.93]Figured it out.
[48:50.63]Figured you out, buddy.
[48:53.71]Oh, he's in some remote location.
[48:55.37]Oh, nice remote location.
[48:56.95]You are the remote location.
[48:59.29]You fuck.
[49:01.33]That's not close enough.
[49:07.63]Connection lost.
[49:08.21]Yeah, I unplugged him.
[49:09.73]I win.
[49:11.35]I beat him.
[49:12.43]I ripped his core.
[49:13.23]See, there's blood over there.
[49:14.97]I did it.
[49:17.91]I unplugged him.
[49:19.47]Connection lost.
[49:21.17]Yeah, I beat his brain.
[49:22.39]What's the next quest?
[49:36.23]Oh, fuck that.
[49:41.61]I think that's your blood.
[49:43.71]Yeah, it was.
[49:48.08]Computer blood.
[49:52.98]Just walking around with dynamite.
[49:54.36]Let's go to... Kurt Schilling 38 Studios.
[50:01.17]Typical anomaly for five months.
[50:03.01]Thanks.
[50:03.31]Welcome back, dude.
[50:16.92]That's so far away.
[50:18.46]I don't want to do this.
[50:21.04]What is there another alternative?
[50:27.13]Holy shit.
[50:29.21]That is across the whole world.
[50:34.40]Well, looks like I'm going to teleport to somewhere close, I guess.
[50:38.82]What have I discovered?
[50:39.64]Can I go over here?
[50:40.93]I cannot travel from this.
[50:43.85]I've got to get out of here.
[50:49.21]Can I just jump out the window?
[50:58.48]What is it?
[51:01.80]Okay.
[51:07.32]No, that doesn't work.
[51:08.72]It doesn't work like that.
[51:09.38]It has to load the area.
[51:10.54]I thought I could just walk out the window and go down.
[51:19.61]Alright, we're fine.
[51:22.23]No cheating.
[51:23.07]No cheating.
[51:26.79]What?
[51:28.17]What did I do?
[51:28.99]What the fuck did I do?
[51:32.19]I don't understand.
[51:33.07]Why are they shooting me?
[51:37.58]I don't get it.
[51:43.28]Hold on.
[51:44.24]What did I do that was so wrong?
[51:45.67]I just walked back in.
[51:52.33]Get the fuck out of here.
[51:55.51]Live on stream cheating.
[51:59.30]It was up the stairs, I remember, because I got freaked out.
[52:03.08]Cheat detected.
[52:07.66]You're at the end of the game.
[52:08.52]No, it's not.
[52:13.79]You're actually in a different world for this area.
[52:15.67]It's not an actual interior.
[52:18.27]Yeah, that's true.
[52:21.65]Oh, I gotta talk to him.
[52:22.83]Take me to... the cocktail lounge.
[52:31.68]No, the casino.
[52:32.46]Just get me out of here.

[53:23.08]I probably should take the dynamite off and put like a gun on while I walk across the fucking desert.
[53:28.17]It's probably a terrible idea.
[53:30.11]What is this?
[53:32.93]Frag mine.
[53:33.67]Pool queue.
[53:35.87]There's my club.

[58:19.40]It'll allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
[58:22.48]You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble.
[58:27.61]Good luck.

[60:03.57]Three minutes.
[60:04.23]Three minutes is a long time.
[60:10.56]It really could be worse.
[60:11.48]You're right.
[60:14.28]We're back in the... Oh, it's her.
[60:17.98]Yeah.
[60:19.48]No, I don't even want to... Get the fuck out of here.
[60:23.87]I'll do it.
[60:24.29]Sure.
[60:25.45]Okay, bye.
[60:27.27]I'm not going to do what she just told me to do.
[60:28.83]I took her shit and I'm leaving.
[60:31.17]You're not getting a goddamn penny out of me.
[60:39.14]Hmm.
[60:42.10]This time, I'm not going to... What did he do?
[60:50.58]Okay.
[60:52.34]Well, apparently you did something wrong.
[60:58.98]They kill him and I just take his clothes off?
[61:02.72]Alright, data.
[61:04.16]World map.
[61:06.09]Okie dokie.
[61:08.93]Let's go back to Novak and save.
[61:12.69]Yeah, thank you for the sniffer.
[61:21.44]That was my... You're right, that was my follower.
[61:24.92]What did he do?
[61:28.10]Why did he shoot him?
[61:28.90]That was my follower.
[61:30.80]I paid him, like, three weeks ago.
[61:40.95]Yeah, I remember buying that guy to follow me around.
[61:43.29]Now it's coming back to me when I last played the game three weeks ago.
[61:47.42]It's kind of funny.
[61:48.42]I don't know what the hell he did, but I guess he did something wrong.
[61:55.56]This time, I need to be prepared.
[61:59.48]I need... Do I have anything that can protect me better?
[62:03.17]I don't think I do.
[62:09.30]I'm gonna have to avoid those fucking things, or... Could bring out the incinerator.
[62:16.79]Shit.
[62:17.51]Wait, where, where, where, where?
[62:20.15]Where is he?
[62:20.47]I know it's just one.
[62:24.15]One shows up.
[62:24.67]This time it's a bee.
[62:29.18]Is this just like World of Warcraft?
[62:30.28]If I stay on the road, will I not, like, aggro any enemies?
[62:36.17]But thank you, Mosley Bird.
[62:37.89]Mosley Bird, four months in a row.
[62:39.09]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[62:47.98]There's the road, there it is.
[62:50.50]Yeah, when I make my run from the barrens to Orgrimmar, I won't get attracted to any little gray wolves.
[62:59.32]What are you shooting?
[63:03.86]I just heard gunshots.
[63:11.67]Now it got a little quiet.
[63:15.89]Hmm.
[63:18.46]Hmm.
[63:21.18]You mean this isn't World of Warcraft?
[63:22.52]There he is.
[63:27.64]There's the lizard.
[63:28.52]Let's queue it up.
[63:33.31]We both missed.
[63:34.93]And he was so embarrassed that he missed as well that he left.
[63:37.07]No, he's coming back.
[63:42.35]What's wrong with him?
[63:44.29]No, he faked me out.
[63:46.45]Give me his hide.
[63:57.37]Now, where the smoke does fire, there was like five of them that came after me last time.
[64:03.75]How do I save?
[64:04.23]F4?
[64:05.01]F5?
[64:05.27]What is the actual save button so I don't have to do it?
[64:09.25]All this time, action mapping.
[64:10.35]What is it?
[64:12.93]It's equal sign.
[64:16.35]Okay, that's weird.
[64:17.73]How the hell would it be equal sign?
[64:25.52]They're going to wrap around.
[64:26.86]I know they are.
[64:27.60]I might just run from them.
[64:31.85]I don't want to repeat a last time.
[64:42.52]Anything in the car?
[64:46.64]How close am I?
[64:48.68]Pretty close.
[64:49.58]Pretty close.
[64:52.41]Equals, equals.
[64:53.15]Hey, Katsikor, eight months.
[64:54.45]That's a long time.
[64:55.47]Thank you for reminding me.
[64:58.47]There's a Scorpizio up there.
[64:59.77]I can't go over here.
[65:04.25]Dramatic music.
[65:14.43]And it's loading assets.
[65:15.81]Did you see that?
[65:16.41]It was like... Something's going to happen over this corner.
[65:28.30]Yeah, I knew it.
[65:33.04]0%.
[65:33.10]Hold on.
[65:33.50]95%.
[65:33.52]That's what I like.
[65:36.91]Bye.
[65:41.63]I knocked him all the way over there.
[65:42.95]What a home run swing.
[65:52.44]Something else up here.
[65:53.14]I don't know what it is.
[65:56.56]What is it?
[65:57.24]I think it's a guy.
[66:01.32]Yeah.
[66:02.44]It's a guy in a slime.
[66:05.87]Is it a ghoul?
[66:06.29]I mean, it's a ghoul.
[66:10.77]Just wait for him.
[66:11.31]Wait for him.
[66:11.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[66:12.91]Acidite!
[66:17.23]One more.
[66:17.53]Right in the face.
[66:21.67]Oh, boy, you exploded.
[66:24.93]Over-encumbered again.
[66:28.81]All this dog hide.
[66:39.50]What's a heavy... I wish you could sort by weight.
[66:41.16]Can you sort by weight?
[66:49.02]Half of this shit I'm never gonna use, ever.
[66:56.61]Harmonica, like, get this out of here.
[66:59.53]Flour.
[66:59.93]Why would I be carrying around flour?
[67:01.35]I was going to carry around some baking soda, just in case.
[67:07.52]Those things sell for a lot, though.
[67:08.52]I want to keep those.
[67:09.58]Okay, whatever.
[67:14.76]What is this?
[67:15.04]Like, watermelon.
[67:18.33]Oh.
[67:19.41]Thank you.
[67:19.69]Alright, here we go.
[67:22.09]This is where I'm supposed to be.
[67:27.17]Right?
[67:28.53]I think.
[67:29.43]No, not quite.
[67:32.37]Keep going down this way.
[67:37.45]Prickly pear?
[67:42.92]You can go over this.
[67:46.42]How could you be so stupid?
[67:50.08]I can't walk over this.
[67:54.01]Why?
[67:54.27]Why?
[67:56.26]I'm going to be so bad at climbing.
[68:00.22]That took way longer than I wanted to do.
[68:10.99]Now I have to eat that prickly pear.
[68:12.91]Otherwise I'm going to be done.
[68:16.98]Some whiskey.
[68:18.54]Some wine.
[68:19.84]And some deviled eggs.
[68:23.52]Squirrel on a stick.
[68:28.39]Do I have to wrap all the way around?
[68:33.24]What the fook?
[68:38.52]Seriously, what the fook?
[68:47.47]Cottonwood cave?
[68:50.71]Maybe I have to go through there.
[68:52.46]Let me just take a look.
[68:54.58]It's like right down here.
[68:57.27]Something is drastically wrong with the world over there, by the way.
[68:59.89]I feel like I'm playing Minecraft.
[69:04.05]And the world just decided not to load an entire chunk of the atmosphere.
[69:07.69]This guy can talk?
[69:25.48]What is going on over here?
[69:30.15]What the hell is going on?
[69:31.27]Is that water?
[69:32.01]Do I have binoculars?
[69:34.35]I'm gonna assume that's water.
[69:50.54]Save it.
[69:55.55]I do want to take like a stim pack or something.
[70:00.47]Thank God I didn't break my legs.
[70:01.55]I would have been so mad about that.
[70:04.55]It's the Colorado River.
[70:05.86]The Colorado River in Las Vegas?
[70:11.08]I don't know about that.
[70:13.16]Oh, Jesus.
[70:14.02]Uh... I was invited.
[70:19.08]You wear the mark of Kaisar.
[70:30.24]You must be who Cursor Lucullus is waiting for.
[70:33.00]You may continue, but be warned.
[70:35.40]Mark or no, we will not tolerate aggressive action by visitors in the camp.
[70:39.22]What the hell did you do to this guy?
[70:43.01]Why is the flayed man of House Bolton up there?
[70:56.01]This person's alive!
[70:57.39]This person's alive!
[70:58.13]What's wrong with these people?
[71:00.85]Can I cut them down?
[71:03.37]To remove them would kill them.
[71:06.01]I... Hold on.
[71:06.75]I can probably, like, snip the wire, right?
[71:09.89]I just gotta be careful.
[71:10.69]I'll, like... Can I carry them?
[71:11.83]I just don't want that guy to see.
[71:14.47]Alright, I'm gonna, like, go behind.
[71:15.81]And I'm gonna very easily just gently break the fucking rope and we're gonna get out of here.
[71:21.23]You and me.
[71:23.56]I'll get it.
[71:23.88]Hold on.
[71:35.06]Why did they have to explode?
[71:37.36]They should have exploded.
[71:38.81]Oh, God.
[71:39.59]Oh, Jesus, that was terrible.
[71:43.29]Action Sloth, thanks for resubbing.
[71:44.83]They exploded.
[71:51.87]I mean, maybe it could have, like, killed them, but they have to explode.
[71:59.62]Holy shit, these guys really are, like, Romans.
[72:10.39]How do I talk to him?
[72:16.90]A profligate bearing the mark of Kaisar.
[72:20.04]What is the world coming to?
[72:22.12]Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you with the barge at the docks.
[72:25.64]He will take you to the fort to speak with Kaisar.
[72:28.20]Man of action.
[72:31.33]That's some nice armor.
[72:32.21]It is the armor of a Kenturion.
[72:33.77]I would love to take it.
[72:34.79]You have the rare honor of beholding it unspattered by the blood of my inferiors.
[72:40.53]Whoa.
[72:42.27]Oh.
[72:43.47]Okay.
[72:46.75]Sure.
[72:48.89]Unspattered by the blood of his inferiors.
[72:51.99]Hmm.
[72:53.37]Well.
[72:56.06]I think I can fix that for you real quick.
[73:24.93]I'll have your head for this.
[73:35.70]Silly mode.
[73:36.32]Alright, where's Little Caesar's pizza?
[73:40.24]Oh, there he is down there.
[73:45.37]Hey, what's going on, little Caesar?
[73:48.27]Five dollar footlongs?
[73:49.35]Is that what you said?
[73:49.99]Is he drowning?
[73:57.97]No, he's not drowning.
[74:00.81]We can't fight in the water.
[74:03.56]Why can we not fight in the water?
[74:06.50]We're just gonna sit here and stare at each other.
[74:07.68]That's what's gonna happen?
[74:12.22]I would throw a punch.
[74:17.79]You like that?
[74:18.93]I sure do.
[74:19.85]He's gonna get a stray bullet in the head.
[74:22.46]And it might be the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen.
[74:26.58]Come on.
[74:29.04]Yeah, keep shooting at me.
[74:32.20]This other guy's trying to swim over here.
[74:35.89]Hey, you like that?
[74:44.09]Come on.
[74:46.71]Come on.
[74:48.89]Come on.
[74:49.59]Yeah, I do.
[74:51.06]I just get them all in here.
[75:03.36]He's gonna miss.
[75:04.90]It's gonna be worth it.
[75:11.58]Come on!
[75:13.76]If you're that bad of a shot, you would have definitely hit this guy in the head by now.
[75:21.29]Maybe I should get a little closer.
[75:25.07]Like here.
[75:31.43]Come on, shoot!
[75:33.45]How am I drowning?
[75:35.10]There was no way I was drowning there, but apparently I was.
[75:37.12]Where'd they go?
[75:42.76]Just drinking the water.
[75:43.96]This works, this is good.
[75:48.48]No friendly fire?
[75:50.61]What do you mean no friendly fire?
[75:51.79]That's bullshit.
[75:59.51]Let me get full health from this.
[76:03.65]I'll take full fucking health.
[76:09.58]Can I do anything here?
[76:12.12]There has to be something I can do to this guy.
[76:13.58]I have to.
[76:14.10]Holy shit, they're all in here.
[76:18.60]That's why nobody can attack me, because they all came in the water.
[76:24.02]Oh, boy.
[76:25.68]Okay, well, follow me over here, guys.
[76:33.01]What the fuck are you doing?
[76:38.27]Where am I?
[76:38.76]Am I still in the water?
[76:39.80]I'm not sure exactly what's happening.
[76:44.30]Now he has his gun.
[76:46.79]He's going to lose it in a second.
[76:47.59]He's going to go in the water.
[76:48.19]He's going to lose it.
[76:50.93]He can still shoot.
[76:53.41]Hold on.
[76:53.77]Hold on.
[76:54.03]This is going to be great.
[76:58.65]Give me a fucking throwing spear.
[77:04.61]Get me on this.
[77:08.03]Get me on there.
[77:09.07]Get me on top.
[77:12.24]Okay.
[77:12.58]Take it out.
[77:13.62]I have like a window of like one second where I can do this.
[77:30.48]I'm just taking out the incinerator.
[77:39.23]Get over here.
[77:40.81]It's too dark.
[77:41.53]It needs to be low.
[77:42.45]How do I make it daytime?
[77:43.73]What's the cheat to make it daytime?
[77:45.33]We went that far.
[77:49.63]Who's got a gun?
[77:50.95]What?
[77:54.17]Who had the gun?
[77:54.93]They were all in the water.
[78:04.89]Fuck you.
[78:05.15]I'm doing this again.
[78:09.25]Hold on a second, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[78:15.34]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[78:16.34]Follow, follow, follow, follow me, follow me.
[78:22.88]Get in the water.
[78:24.58]You fuckers.
[78:29.12]I have to do this, this is really important.
[78:30.86]I have to get the whole town in the water.
[78:40.25]What is the set time scale?
[78:42.53]Set time scale to 9000.
[78:43.59]There we go.
[78:49.88]Make it like daytime.
[78:54.98]Perfect.
[78:56.50]Okay.
[78:58.40]I have to go inside of the beach.
[79:00.28]What's going on?
[79:03.49]What's going on here?
[79:07.67]Does it just change the day to night?
[79:09.46]Okay, this guy.
[79:15.48]He's gonna come out again.
[79:16.36]He's gonna come out again.
[79:17.92]He comes out at night and he leaves.
[79:21.73]When he comes out again, I'm gonna fucking crush him.
[79:25.81]I'm gonna fucking send this guy to hell.
[79:34.22]No, I gotta fix this.
[79:35.20]I gotta fix this.
[79:37.62]Oh, that's 9,000 times speed?
[79:40.64]Oh, hold on a second.
[79:51.25]Oh, God.
[79:56.03]Days are passing as minutes, weeks are growing as hours.
[80:01.19]We're all aging.
[80:11.03]I need to do this.
[80:18.27]This guy doesn't know what to do with himself.
[80:19.50]Okay, I'm having my fun.
[80:24.72]There we go.
[80:37.35]Time scale to one.
[80:38.51]It'll never be day.
[80:39.47]It'll never be night time.
[80:45.35]Okay, now we need to get in the water.
[80:47.49]We need to cause trouble.
[80:50.87]Dive!
[80:51.09]Okay.
[80:54.23]I'm gonna swim out.
[81:00.02]Real far.
[81:00.70]They're all gonna come in the water.
[81:01.62]And we're gonna have a blast over by the boat.
[81:08.72]Since when do you guys have brains?
[81:13.94]Why did you... You just got a brain for no reason.
[81:16.12]Get in here.
[81:17.86]What the fuck?
[81:19.30]Finally, somebody swam out to me.
[81:25.44]Come on.
[81:29.72]He's still shooting.
[81:32.27]I wish he would just jump in.
[81:34.21]Please just jump in.
[81:38.74]Here they all come.
[81:39.68]Here come the fish people.
[81:40.80]Except the one idiot that won't come in here.
[81:45.08]This one asshole is ruining everything.
[81:48.60]Get the fuck in here.
[81:52.96]Get in the water.
[81:53.86]Get in the water.
[81:54.66]Just fall in the water.
[81:57.94]Okay, I've given you enough time.
[82:00.08]I've given you enough fucking time.
[82:01.78]Get the fuck in the water.
[82:04.30]Get in the water.
[82:06.74]Get in.
[82:11.46]Ugh, you fucking punk.
[82:16.72]Now he's just dead.
[82:20.50]I'm like getting stuck.
[82:29.17]Get in the fucking water.
[82:32.97]Ugh.
[82:33.81]No, no, no.
[82:34.55]Here we go.
[82:35.39]Okay.
[82:36.84]What is this dog?
[82:38.98]Whose dog is this?
[82:42.81]Is there a random dog?
[82:46.73]Okay.
[82:47.67]Quest failed, but it's okay.
[82:49.23]I'm gonna group them up.
[82:51.05]We're gonna have some fun.
[82:58.37]Come on.
[82:58.71]Collectively follow me around.
[82:59.97]There we go.
[83:06.41]One, two, three, four, five.
[83:07.87]This couple guys stuck back here.
[83:12.17]It keeps failing quests for me.
[83:14.83]And I'm not exactly sure why.
[83:19.29]It's failing every quest in the whole game.
[83:25.02]Are there any more quests that I can fail?
[83:27.56]Yeah.
[83:30.40]Alright, let's move over here.
[83:36.66]Where is this button?
[83:38.38]Get off my screen!
[83:42.35]Look at the guy in the back.
[83:44.45]He's doing jumping jacks.
[83:47.15]Okay.
[83:48.91]This is a good spot.
[83:50.27]Nobody can... Get up there.
[83:54.15]Good spot.
[83:56.06]Okay.
[83:56.82]This is perfect.
[83:59.34]Hey, what's going on, Hypo?
[84:00.42]Hey, it's Fallout!
[84:01.12]I missed a lot of good stuff, I bet.
[84:02.26]Well, we just got started.
[84:04.86]So what do we do?
[84:05.58]I gotta save it right here.
[84:08.11]This is important.
[84:10.65]What do I have?
[84:12.94]I'm gonna have dynamite.
[84:14.04]Does the incinerator work here?
[84:20.07]Oh, fuck!
[84:24.85]Come on, don't... It's not gonna burn the whole way, right?
[84:27.15]I don't wanna jump in the water and lose my position.
[84:28.57]Okay.
[84:32.73]So many people over there.
[84:34.77]What do I do?
[84:36.69]What do I do?
[84:37.43]I wanna take off somebody's head.
[84:38.65]We're gonna go back to the spear.
[84:39.55]I wanna spear somebody.
[84:40.69]That was awesome.
[84:45.58]Okay, we're gonna play a game.
[84:47.64]Who do I hit in the head?
[84:49.82]Okay, well it looks like it's gonna be you.
[84:51.26]No, you're gonna get to... What?
[84:54.20]Where's the gun?
[84:55.84]Where's the gun?
[84:56.24]Where's the guy with the gun?
[84:59.89]There is nobody with a gun.
[85:02.83]There's nobody with a gun!
[85:04.39]Oh, he's back there on the fucking... Shit.
[85:10.17]It's okay, it's okay.
[85:11.63]It's okay, we're fine.
[85:12.73]That guy just can't be trusted.
[85:16.81]In fact, that guy's... Okay, throwing spear.
[85:24.19]Remember this guy?
[85:24.87]Talking all the shit about his armor?
[85:26.07]Yeah, we'll see.
[85:30.21]What?
[85:30.73]Come on.
[85:32.23]Fucking fuck.
[85:34.44]I need to do things.
[85:35.28]I need to, like, do terrible things.
[85:37.72]That gun.
[85:45.32]This should be way easier than it actually is.
[85:54.03]What the fuck?
[85:58.46]Dude, player set scale 900?
[85:59.80]Okay.
[86:01.74]What is it, dot?
[86:07.47]It's dot, right?
[86:16.81]I'm just a giant now.
[86:17.91]Okay.
[86:18.25]No, I don't want to be this big.
[86:27.10]This is stupid.
[86:29.68]I'm just a titan.
[86:31.74]Alright, let me see.
[86:34.78]I can't even aim.
[86:36.58]How do I aim?
[86:40.94]What happened?
[86:43.73]Did somebody shoot me?
[86:51.10]KenS is back.
[86:52.26]Thanks for eight months.
[86:53.10]Long time.
[86:54.42]Welcome, dude.
[86:54.88]Yeah, we'll throw some dynamite in there and call it a day.
[86:59.62]And Avenger75, three months.
[87:01.04]Jerry, please.
[87:02.62]This is important, dude.
[87:03.48]Long fuse dynamite.
[87:05.46]When all else fails, just throw dynamite.
[87:09.48]Throw it, like, right over there.
[87:21.84]This is not even funny.
[87:24.33]I thought it was going to be funnier.
[87:27.87]How do I make this more funny?
[87:29.43]There has to be a way, right?
[87:31.45]Oh, I know.
[87:32.15]I have a way.
[87:35.49]Oh, fuck.
[87:35.95]No, hold on.
[87:37.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[87:38.68]I got to get up there and make her walk on it.
[87:46.32]I did it.
[87:46.58]I got it.
[87:47.36]I dropped it.
[87:47.94]Where'd it go?
[87:49.34]Where is it?
[87:58.53]Alright, let's spawn.
[87:59.43]Oh, the game crashed.
[88:00.27]Fuck.
[88:03.67]Son of a bitch.
[88:08.55]We lost the game.
[88:09.55]It didn't like our bullshit.
[88:15.28]I'm coming back.
[88:22.68]Set scale to 0.1.
[88:26.99]Alright, what's the, uh, what's Deathclaw again?
[88:29.19]No, what's, I wanna, I know what I'm gonna do.
[88:30.83]Let me spawn more people in there.
[88:40.05]This is what happens when I play Fallout.
[88:41.99]I get locked into one thing.
[88:49.00]Okay.
[88:50.90]Give me some things to spawn in.
[88:51.90]I wanna spawn, like, I wanna have, like, a swimming pool.
[88:58.68]Run fast.
[89:00.22]Alright, give me some easy peats.
[89:01.36]No, no, no.
[89:01.98]Yeah, not easy peats.
[89:03.70]What's the Romans here?
[89:06.04]Because won't they be hostile to me if they see other Romans in peril?
[89:15.79]This guy got the gun again.
[89:23.97]Yeah, if I spot a bunch of Romans, then they'll be all at my mercy.
[89:30.21]Oh, I didn't want it steady.
[89:34.71]It doesn't matter.
[89:35.41]This save is meaningless, so don't worry.
[89:39.44]Do I not have any most impact?
[89:42.14]Apparently not.
[89:46.74]Place at me.
[89:47.56]00121FEF.
[90:00.08]I don't know what it is.
[90:00.76]Okay, here they are.
[90:04.02]Oh, this is gonna be perfect.
[90:05.68]Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
[90:06.92]Okay, let's get more of them.
[90:10.97]We're gonna be a school of fish.
[90:17.39]They're all hostile.
[90:22.33]They're all unarmed and they're all hostile.
[90:23.87]This is perfect.
[90:26.25]They're not all gonna drown, are they?
[90:30.03]Okay.
[90:30.21]We're going to have an underwater brawl.
[90:35.27]Oh, wait a minute.
[90:36.27]Wait a minute.
[90:38.13]Wait a minute.
[90:40.51]They're all migrating.
[90:41.99]They're all migrating.
[90:44.67]Where are they going?
[90:45.85]Oh, God.
[90:48.75]They're all going home.
[90:52.58]What is home to them?
[90:55.35]I kind of don't understand.
[90:58.51]What's like fucking like underwater murderers?
[91:01.08]Are there sharks?
[91:03.86]Please tell me I can spawn sharks.
[91:05.00]This is gonna be a feeding frenzy in here.
[91:08.70]What's like an underwater animal that eats people?
[91:22.19]We need an underwater creature.
[91:23.99]If anybody has it, I'd love to see it.
[91:26.27]EC01E?
[91:28.31]I'll try it, whatever it is.
[91:32.81]EC... Okay, don't... God, they're just coming through so fast.
[91:37.01]15E908.
[91:37.99]Wait, what?
[91:38.59]15E, what was it?
[91:39.33]I missed it.
[91:43.29]150015E908.
[91:53.16]Wait, what?
[91:58.14]Okay, 0, 0.
[92:02.14]1, 5.
[92:02.58]E, 9, 0, 8.
[92:04.18]10.
[92:04.54]I don't know what to do.
[92:06.84]Oh, fuck, it's goddamn deathclaws.
[92:09.58]No, it's not.
[92:09.94]What are these?
[92:12.41]Why can't they do anything either?
[92:15.59]Why can nobody do anything in the water?
[92:20.75]Nobody can do anything.
[92:22.75]Water is kryptonite to every single thing in the whole game, no matter what it is.
[92:26.49]Monster, human.
[92:28.27]They're just yelling at each other.
[92:29.59]They're talking shit.
[92:32.48]Oh no, one of them's climbing on top of each other.
[92:51.72]Hold on, hold on.
[92:54.12]My lord.
[92:59.99]Eventually one of them is going to get high enough and eat someone.
[93:08.27]It's 0094BA.
[93:09.23]Okay, we'll do that.
[93:12.19]0094BA.
[93:16.93]We'll go with like five.
[93:21.05]That doesn't work.
[93:24.91]Wait, what?
[93:26.29]I have no idea what's going on with the exact content I stopped for.
[93:28.99]Thank you, Throomond, for two months.
[93:30.81]Learn to spell for two months.
[93:32.47]And then again, Jamie, for double one, nine, six, for two months.
[93:35.72]All three years.
[93:36.20]11145EDA.
[93:37.54]145EDA.
[93:37.66]What are these?
[93:54.14]These don't do anything either.
[93:55.17]And these are like swamp creatures too.
[93:59.87]This is fucking stupid.
[94:02.23]I want an underwater sea battle.
[94:05.03]But it's not gonna happen.
[94:06.16]These guys only care about me.
[94:17.53]Nothing can attack while swimming.
[94:18.91]Yeah.
[94:19.83]So there's no sharks in the game.
[94:24.60]Oh, this guy attacked.
[94:28.60]Oh, that guy has a gun.
[94:30.60]Good luck.
[94:32.78]00E7D3.
[94:33.20]E07D3.
[94:33.62]We'll try this and then they're all dead.
[94:43.36]Oh, fuck.
[94:43.78]What was it again?
[94:44.36]E7.
[94:44.58]Fuck.
[94:46.99]I always lose it because there's so many numbers and letters to remember.
[94:48.95]I'm going to copy this.
[94:53.87]Try this one.
[95:02.83]I can't fucking copy and paste that shit.
[95:12.76]What just happened?
[95:16.94]This spawns like scientists.
[95:21.21]Alright, they're all dead.
[95:22.23]This is a failure.
[95:23.85]This is a catastrophic failure.
[95:26.91]They all died.
[95:33.40]I'm just gonna spawn these.
[95:34.32]This is the last chance.
[95:36.66]Fe 034.
[95:37.82]We'll try it.
[95:42.24]Fe 034.
[95:42.86]These look like frog people.
[95:51.15]These look like frog people to me.
[95:57.98]No.
[95:58.82]The game's crashed.
[95:59.44]This is dead.
[95:59.86]Like, the fuck?
[96:02.55]Nobody fights in the water.
[96:04.01]Not one enemy fights in the water.
[96:05.75]Alright, we're done.
[96:07.97]We're gonna move on.
[96:11.45]Ugh.
[96:11.89]What a pain in the fucking butt.
[96:14.05]Dick.
[96:14.87]Butt head.
[96:17.59]Kill all.
[96:18.05]Kill all before it's too late.
[96:23.12]Can't use the hooker.
[96:25.76]Not quite.
[96:26.14]We're still going strong.
[96:31.12]Easy Pete fights in the water.
[96:34.80]I wish it could be sharks.
[96:36.16]It would just be a gigantic swarm feeding frenzy.
[96:38.28]It'd be amazing.
[96:38.80]Okay, uh... We ended up... God, come on.
[96:50.89]Are you serious?
[96:51.67]I didn't save it before... Yes, I did.
[96:56.87]Didn't I save it before...
[97:22.88]No, you know what?
[97:24.42]Fuck this.
[97:28.41]How do I run fast?
[97:30.29]What's the super speed?
[97:32.15]How do I do it?
[97:32.73]Because I was there.
[97:36.05]I'm just going to run as fast as I can there.
[97:43.32]Yeah, fuck it.
[97:43.96]Fuck this.
[97:45.93]Let's go.
[97:51.69]Like, I'm not doing that again.
[97:56.83]To set speed.
[98:02.05]Player.
[98:03.25]Set speed.
[98:04.25]What is it?
[98:04.81]One word?
[98:05.29]Two words?
[98:06.61]How the fuck does... Okay.
[98:07.73]Player dot set speed.
[98:14.83]What the hell?
[98:19.30]Player.SetAVSpeedMult 3000.
[98:22.06]That's a lot.
[98:24.50]Player.SetAVSpeedMult.
[98:31.56]I'm not even doing it.
[98:34.60]SetAVSpeedMult 1000.
[98:40.79]Okay.
[98:43.37]Let's get back.
[98:44.11]What direction are we going?
[98:45.33]This way?
[98:45.61]Okay.
[98:45.87]Okay.
[98:47.81]That's making me slow.
[98:48.77]That's making me really slow.
[98:50.97]That's making me incredibly slow.
[98:55.92]There.
[98:56.46]Right?
[98:57.98]Nope.
[98:59.94]We could already be there.
[99:03.30]Fucking hundred thousand.
[99:06.46]Face the right direction.
[99:07.20]Here we go.
[99:11.04]Why the fuck is this not working?
[99:14.16]What just happened?
[99:15.68]The game crashed.
[99:22.76]Was I moving too fast?
[99:24.60]Was it like quicksand?
[99:25.76]What's the guy from X-Men?
[99:29.83]Too fast.
[99:41.49]It was just Quicksilver from X-Men.
[99:46.37]I get to turn off collision?
[99:47.45]Okay.
[99:49.81]Turn off the noclip?
[99:53.55]I actually could have been there.
[99:55.98]I would have been there.
[99:57.54]Right now.
[99:59.14]If I had just done it normally.
[100:05.54]Okay.
[100:06.12]Here we go.
[100:06.96]Player.
[100:08.05]Can I just do it up?
[100:09.19]Up, right?
[100:09.71]No.
[100:10.01]Because it wasn't saved.
[100:10.67]Player.
[100:11.91]Set AV.
[100:13.59]Mult.
[100:14.57]What was it?
[100:15.03]I fucking forget it already.
[100:18.92]Set... It's too many commands.
[100:22.06]Set heavy speed mult.
[100:23.98]Set heavy speed mult.
[100:27.11]10 fucking thousand.
[100:28.53]Okay.
[100:29.27]Let's go.
[100:33.19]Oh boy.
[100:34.45]Alright.
[100:34.81]Are we there?
[100:36.85]No, not yet.
[100:39.63]Don't fall!
[100:40.37]Don't fall!
[100:50.86]Shit.
[100:52.02]Shit.
[100:52.98]Shit.
[100:54.04]Shit.
[100:54.72]We would have been there.
[100:59.98]The fucking game crashed again.
[101:01.34]I could have been there twice.
[101:17.96]Get me out of here.
[101:21.14]Get me out of here again.
[101:22.04]Wait, what?
[101:29.49]I can't even close out the program.
[101:33.91]I can't even close it.
[101:41.05]Too much power for a mortal man.
[101:44.35]How about 5,000 instead?
[101:44.96]Yeah.
[101:48.80]Yeah, you're probably right.
[101:51.60]Remove one zero.
[101:52.92]I'm going to now.
[101:54.32]Time to restart the computer.
[102:06.01]Just use Cottonwood Cove building.
[102:09.57]There are so many ways to make this easier, I know.
[102:16.18]Why can't I skip this?
[102:23.66]Okay.
[102:25.00]I'm just going to do COC.
[102:28.46]Somebody just put it in there.
[102:29.54]COC 003 E608F.
[102:38.09]E608F.
[102:39.15]Okay.
[102:39.47]Let's teleport.
[102:43.83]It didn't do anything.
[102:48.99]Where is it supposed to be taking me?
[102:56.88]What does that do?
[102:58.92]Did that just do something bad?
[103:01.10]Did I just, like, activate something I shouldn't have?
[103:07.30]COC.
[103:10.20]Cottonwood Cove.
[103:11.46]Cottonwood Cove Building 01.
[103:20.60]Hey!
[103:21.41]Look at that!
[103:23.37]I made it!
[103:25.70]Where is it?
[103:27.84]Where is it?
[103:29.54]I don't know where this is.
[103:30.32]Where is it?
[103:30.64]No, I don't want to be up here.
[103:37.36]Isn't this just... Where the fuck is this?
[103:43.49]I'm in a dream world.
[103:47.31]How do I get out of here?
[104:02.40]What the hell is going on?
[104:06.27]Is this one building?
[104:11.77]This doesn't seem right.
[104:16.39]How do I get out of here?
[104:17.51]Teleport to COC Good Springs.
[104:33.53]I'm safe.
[104:35.69]But where am I?
[104:38.39]No, not quite safe.
[104:39.51]Where is this?
[104:41.76]No, I'm like even further away.
[104:43.56]I've managed to go even further away than I was before.
[104:47.42]I was here.
[104:48.86]I managed to go over here.
[104:50.72]I could have been there if I just walked.
[104:52.77]This is unbelievable.
[105:00.53]Uh...
[105:05.20]I have a better idea.
[105:13.60]Turning a collision on.
[105:14.75]Wait, what?
[105:16.01]Let's go.
[105:16.59]I will just be a titan and just run.
[105:23.45]Let's move.
[105:35.45]I tripped over the fence and died.
[105:48.62]I tripped and died.
[105:57.56]Move to QT?
[105:58.66]Where the fuck is QT?
[106:00.68]Oh, wait.
[106:04.13]Where am I?
[106:04.69]Oh, it's this guy.
[106:06.45]Okay, we're here.
[106:07.89]It was so easy.
[106:12.41]That was so easy.
[106:15.92]Why did that have to be so difficult?
[106:22.52]Okay, we'll go through this again.
[106:26.22]Show him the mark.
[106:31.03]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[106:31.87]There's the guy with the dog.
[106:33.99]Okay, seriously, guys.
[106:36.07]For real.
[106:37.59]I'm about to save the game.
[106:40.16]I activated a couple things.
[106:41.54]I don't know what they were.
[106:42.28]I don't want to save this game right now.
[106:44.74]Am I gonna, like, fuck myself totally?
[106:46.20]Like, what happened?
[106:48.26]Somebody may be typing a bunch of weird shit and it, like, didn't do anything, but it probably did.
[106:51.87]What did it do?
[106:53.91]Am I okay?
[106:55.27]Am I, like, alright to play the game normally?
[106:57.61]Or what?
[107:05.41]I'm scared.
[107:05.85]Hey, this is the guy I gotta talk to.
[107:12.25]Save.
[107:13.75]New save.
[107:15.04]There we are.
[107:16.74]Alright, we had some subs come in.
[107:19.22]Vortox, thank you for four months.
[107:21.42]Freshly canned sushi, thank you for two months.
[107:24.56]And Jamie, I think I already got Jamie for $11.96.
[107:27.06]If I didn't, I'm sorry, but I believe I did.
[107:29.40]And... Much love.
[107:33.51]Okie dokie, let's go.
[107:35.27]Um...
[107:42.88]Yeah.
[107:43.50]The trip will take a few hours.
[107:45.44]Take your place on the boat.
[107:48.34]Okay, we're good.
[107:51.65]By order of Kaisar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items.
[107:58.47]What's considered a banned item?
[107:59.75]Alcohol and all chems.
[108:01.27]I can't drink any alcohol.
[108:02.09]Including stims and other addictive items.
[108:03.91]What?
[108:06.31]Yeah, I have a heart defect.
[108:07.96]I know not why Kaisar would wish to speak with such a physically inferior whelp.
[108:12.97]Yeah, dummy.
[108:14.53]Okay, take my stuff.
[108:21.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[108:22.28]Sure thing.
[108:23.10]Sure thing.
[108:25.04]So I gotta talk to... Okay, what was I supposed to even do?
[108:29.84]Recover the platinum chip.
[108:34.28]Use the platinum chip to open the secret bunker at Fortification Hill.
[108:40.10]Speak with Kaisar.
[108:48.82]Okay.
[108:53.78]I'll just talk to Kaisar.
[108:55.32]Where is he?
[109:00.74]Shouldn't he be somewhere?
[109:02.00]Oh, there he is.
[109:02.34]I have to access it.
[109:03.54]Alright, Kaisar.
[109:05.84]Caesar.
[109:06.28]Caesar.
[109:07.42]Caesar.
[109:08.48]Caesar.
[109:14.71]These are bad guys, right?
[109:18.88]I'm assuming these are bad guys.
[109:25.82]When you have a secret base that's up on a hill like this, behind a bunch of walls, you're a bad guy.
[109:31.60]And you're dead.
[109:32.68]I'll take him out.
[109:33.52]With my bare hands.
[109:37.09]I will punch this guy so many times that he can't even breathe.
[109:39.51]Where are you guys going?
[109:44.31]Suspicious children.
[109:46.55]Huh.
[109:48.25]What are they up to?
[109:52.19]Where are they going so quickly?
[109:55.47]Something's not right here.
[109:57.91]Children running from the encampment?
[110:00.40]I'm not sure about this.
[110:03.28]But I will press on.
[110:11.69]Halt!
[110:11.99]Who goes there?
[110:12.85]They could pick his neck.
[110:14.83]He's picking his nose.
[110:18.06]I just caught it on camera.
[110:20.16]Get embarrassed.
[110:21.42]Please eat it.
[110:21.94]Eat it.
[110:22.68]Fucking eat the next one.
[110:24.92]He better eat the next one.
[110:26.02]Eat it.
[110:32.43]That's all this guy does?
[110:33.61]Is just pick his nose.
[110:35.73]How many boogers do you have?
[110:42.50]This guy's fucked.
[110:47.10]No!
[110:47.70]What am I doing?
[110:48.52]Why would you do that?
[110:49.38]There's no reason to do that.
[110:50.62]Okay, thank God.
[110:51.28]I just had an impulse to punch this guy.
[110:55.46]I couldn't help it.
[110:56.02]I wish I had a weapon right now.
[111:09.49]There's like a fighting pit here.
[111:10.58]I'm gonna use the fight.
[111:14.18]I'm gonna use the fight.
[111:20.10]Well, lookie what we have here.
[111:23.70]We've got quite a few things to steal.
[111:25.86]Ooh, shotgun!
[111:31.01]I'll take a shotgun.
[111:39.27]Yes, yes, yes.
[111:41.83]Oh boy, oh boy.
[111:43.07]Hmm, I got armor too.
[111:49.64]Put it on.
[111:53.42]I still have this stupid hat on.
[111:59.60]I look like such a dickhead.
[112:00.94]Good.
[112:06.59]Hold on, this is important.
[112:11.47]No.
[112:12.29]Is this the guy?
[112:19.78]Where's the guy?
[112:21.22]He's in here, right?
[112:21.96]Yep.
[112:22.46]This is Kaizar's tent.
[112:27.22]There he is.
[112:31.38]That's him, right?
[112:32.08]Sitting on like the Horde throne.
[112:38.36]think you can fucking take out my fucking friends have like slaves and shit somebody get the music ready we're about to go in blasting nobody has a weapon
[113:02.56]What?
[113:03.48]Why does nobody have a gun?
[113:06.21]Nobody has a gun.
[113:11.03]Why doesn't anybody have a weapon?
[113:14.35]That just threw me off guard so bad.
[113:18.03]Wait a second.
[113:18.64]Wait a second.
[113:19.38]Wait a second.
[113:25.56]Holy hell of power fists.
[113:26.96]I fucked it up again.
[113:29.06]I fucked it up again.
[113:34.42]Alright.
[113:41.33]We're doing this again.
[113:43.39]Point blank.
[113:44.97]In his head.
[113:45.99]Point blank.
[113:47.41]Single shotgun.
[113:48.89]One shot is all we need.
[113:49.96]Didn't do any damage to him.
[114:01.19]Shoot him in the head.
[114:02.95]What the fuck is going on?
[114:10.19]Jesus.
[114:12.97]I can't kill these guys.
[114:15.33]I can't hand the... I wish I could do like CQC.
[114:17.35]Oh, it's Benny.
[114:18.23]It's Benny.
[114:19.47]Oh my God.
[114:20.09]Yes.
[114:20.95]That was my chance.
[114:29.40]Put that away.
[114:32.92]It's so easy!
[114:33.67]This is the guy I wanted to kill all along.
[114:40.69]Seriously, how many shotgun shots in the fucking head does it take to kill a guy in this game?
[114:45.63]I don't get it.
[114:46.71]Like, you think his head would have exploded.
[114:48.77]No, he's still alive.
[114:49.46]This guy's, uh, he's still alive.
[114:53.79]What an awful way to go.
[114:54.85]Why did his whole body explode?
[114:57.23]He turned into like a piece of meat.
[114:59.58]No.
[115:28.07]Oh boy, this is great.
[115:29.39]I love it.
[115:29.99]I love it.
[115:30.39]I love it.
[115:32.37]Okay, I gotta talk to Caesar.
[115:33.31]Yeah, yeah.
[115:33.83]I should be going.
[115:34.25]I'll deal with you in a minute.
[115:35.07]I should be going.
[116:07.24]What was it?
[116:10.70]What was it?
[116:11.18]One, two.
[116:14.52]One, two.
[116:17.16]I think it's one, three.
[116:18.20]Yep, five.
[116:20.53]I don't know.
[116:21.49]What is it?
[116:21.89]How do I do it?
[116:27.83]Somebody's cheating.
[116:32.31]Oh, I could do that, too.
[116:33.01]Let's just see what happens.
[116:40.82]Why not?
[116:41.06]There it is.
[116:41.38]Somebody in chat knows what's up.
[116:43.22]Somebody in chat knows what the fuck's going on.
[116:47.57]173 FBO.
[116:47.95]Wait, 167 EC.
[116:48.33]Let's try that one.
[116:49.43]What?
[117:12.31]1, 6, 7.
[117:12.39]Oh, you see 1.
[117:14.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[117:15.25]0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 7.
[117:15.73]You see 1.
[117:16.56]0, 0.
[117:16.70]Okay.
[117:16.86]Good luck.
[117:42.24]Fucking destroyed that thing.
[117:43.41]Are you serious?
[117:43.77]That was so easy of them.
[117:44.51]See, they deal with two.
[117:45.39]Nice.
[117:45.51]Nice victory.
[117:46.05]They can't get in here.
[118:12.47]That is so terrifying.
[118:17.38]He's saying Bob in his head.
[118:20.60]Get in.
[118:22.10]Get in.
[118:22.70]They so badly want to kill him.
[118:25.10]Get in.
[118:26.48]I insta-killed him.
[118:29.95]Get in there.
[118:41.36]Fuck you, Betty.
[118:45.90]I will kill you.
[118:48.26]You'll die.
[118:51.56]Oh, fuck.
[118:52.14]Let's just play the game.
[118:53.36]I'm done with that.
[118:57.93]Let's see.
[118:59.23]I want to kill him.
[119:00.97]Apollo 22237.
[119:02.99]Thank you for four months.
[119:05.33]I'm going to play the game of thrones here, guys.
[119:18.79]Play the Game of Thrones, either win or you die.
[119:22.67]Let's play the Game of Thrones.
[119:24.45]Yep, yep, yep.
[119:26.05]Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
[119:44.63]Benny is my prisoner.
[119:46.21]You don't deal with him unless you've dealt with me.
[119:50.09]Don't worry.
[119:51.29]You'll get the platinum chip he was carrying, and then you'll use it like I tell you to.
[119:56.17]It's absolutely not going to happen, no matter what.
[119:57.45]The time is fast approaching when my legion will assault the Great Dam and invade the West.
[120:01.94]Before that happens, I want Mr. House knocked out of the game.
[120:05.08]Wait, what?
[120:07.60]With you doing the punching.
[120:10.46]SFM James, thanks for five months.
[120:12.27]Welcome back.
[120:14.61]What do I have to do?
[120:15.67]Down the hill at the west edge of camp is an old building.
[120:19.81]Inside the building is a hatch.
[120:22.35]And inside that hatch are two steel doors that bear the sigil of the Lucky 38 cassette.
[120:28.19]Now that same sigil is on the platinum chip Benny was carrying.
[120:31.57]Wow, what a development.
[120:33.05]Even more interesting, there's a slot about the same size as the chip on the console that opens the hatch.
[120:40.75]I think the platinum chip opens those doors.
[120:45.35]Okay, what do I do when I get in?
[120:46.23]I want you to destroy whatever you find in there.
[120:48.77]And then I want you to go to the building and take this fucking platinum chip with you.
[120:54.17]The one time he swears.
[120:55.33]Go to the building and take this fucking platinum chip.
[120:58.17]Maybe you want to remind him.
[121:04.70]Okay.
[121:04.82]Yeah, you didn't play the Game of Thrones better.
[121:06.30]You have no one to blame but yourself.
[121:08.12]Uh, well, he gave me the platinum chip.
[121:33.71]Sure.
[121:34.55]Baldi wants you to go down there in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
[121:38.92]Oh, you don't want to do that, baby.
[121:40.88]Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas.
[121:44.88]So here's what you do.
[121:46.58]You go down there and you use the chip to do whatever Mr. House will want you to do.
[121:51.45]And when you get back to the strip, you find Yes Man.
[121:56.13]I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
[121:59.07]No, you're fucking... No, you die.
[122:00.81]Try not to smile so wide, bitch.
[122:03.92]Let's see.
[122:07.48]Maybe we could... Crucifixion.
[122:09.22]Maybe we should fight it out in the arena.
[122:15.32]Yeah!
[122:16.14]Trial by combat.
[122:19.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[122:21.41]I'm gonna trial by combat the fuck out of you.
[122:24.65]Take this fucking platinum chip and get the fuck out of my face, you fucking idiot.
[122:30.36]Take this fucking chip and get the fuck out of my face, you fucking wanker.
[122:35.82]Hey, your tape is fucking chippy.
[122:37.32]Get the fuck out of my fucking face, you fucking wanker.
[122:45.63]Candlestick.
[122:46.57]Jack, be quick.
[122:48.97]Where is this place?
[122:50.57]Oh, it's right there.
[122:52.13]Easy.
[122:53.71]Oh, it's right there.
[122:55.23]Easy.
[123:05.60]Wait, what?
[123:08.70]Boards of pigeons for months of a subscription.
[123:13.50]Thank you.
[123:14.72]Welcome back.
[123:17.05]Much appreciated.
[123:17.95]Okay.
[123:28.91]Kaiser has put a lot of trust in you to take this fucking chip and get out of here, you fucking wanker.
[123:33.67]Where is it?
[123:34.89]Huh?
[123:35.47]Do I have to, like, pull a library book out of the thing?
[123:43.08]I don't get it.
[123:43.48]Where is it?
[123:46.08]Oh.
[123:48.24]Open the hatch.
[123:57.39]Stats, items, weapons.
[123:59.21]Let me get my... Rebar club.
[124:05.47]Can I repair it?
[124:07.37]Nah.
[124:08.32]Nah.
[124:11.00]Put it on, you dummy.
[124:14.06]Nah.
[124:15.96]What are my options down here?
[124:16.92]I trash this place?
[124:17.96]Let me see what the options are.
[124:21.12]Data.
[124:22.96]Quests.
[124:24.26]Demolish Mr. House's bunker under the weather station.
[124:27.90]Yeah, I want to fight Benny in the fighting pit.
[124:32.76]Go.
[124:36.56]Into the secret... Upgrade Mr. House's secret security.
[124:39.71]I see you reached your destination safely.
[124:42.37]Shall we get to work?
[124:43.51]Yeah, I'm trashing this place.
[124:44.53]I'm going to tell him, too.
[124:48.37]Was that meant to be a shocking revelation?
[124:50.51]I want him to know what's going to happen.
[124:51.63]Of course Caesar wants it destroyed.
[124:53.49]He's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
[124:57.25]But you're not going to do that.
[124:59.07]You're going to do the smart thing and work for me.
[125:02.11]Nope.
[125:05.33]Uh... Nah, maybe I should just destroy everything down here.
[125:09.52]I don't respond well to threats.
[125:12.00]Now, where were we?
[125:13.70]The Platinum Chip is a data storage device.
[125:17.12]I need you to manually upload data from the chip to the facility's primary computer.
[125:20.24]I just told him two times that I wasn't going to do it.
[125:22.60]There's a terminal at the other end of this facility.
[125:25.68]There's a complication.
[125:27.37]While I can broadcast to this screen, I can't control any of the facility systems.
[125:31.85]Why is he telling me this?
[125:33.35]I'm going to trash this whole lab.
[125:37.32]Can I cut him off and be like, look, dude, excuse me, sorry, but I'm trashing the place.
[125:46.16]Yeah, fuck you.
[125:47.36]Listen to me very carefully.
[125:50.04]I've waited too long for this moment for you to go fouling it up on alarm.
[125:55.35]Doesn't even swear either.
[125:56.15]The other guy swore.
[125:57.19]Nope.
[125:57.33]I love how it's telling me, change your mind.
[125:58.92]Let's start with the shitty fucking LCD screen.
[126:25.37]On second thought, we'll start with the other room.
[126:29.40]Get the fuck out of my face!
[126:34.98]Whoa!
[126:37.42]That was actually scary, I thought I died.
[126:38.61]Alright, we're gonna trash the place.
[126:41.45]Trash it.
[126:43.49]Fucking Half-Life 3.
[126:44.29]Yeah, give me this, give me this, give me the fucking Half-Life 3 suit, quick.
[126:50.06]Nice.
[126:56.72]Nice shooting.
[127:00.75]Nice shooting, stupid.
[127:06.21]I haven't even taken one hit.
[127:13.35]Not even one point of damage, boys.
[127:23.46]I think that deserves a celebratory drink.
[127:28.20]Let's destroy this place.
[127:28.80]I asked if there was something still on.
[127:56.19]Oh, I knew there was, uh, whatever.
[127:59.11]Let me have this one.
[128:03.49]Let me have this one, please.
[128:05.99]What?
[128:06.29]Now why am I overburdened?
[128:15.07]Turning off God mode, yeah, would probably help.
[128:19.68]That's funny.
[128:21.36]That's funny.
[128:32.48]I thought I was just dodging all those bullets.
[128:34.68]I still have 155 of these stupid fucking things.
[128:38.72]Okay.
[128:38.90]Well.
[128:39.08]Quick save.
[128:39.36]Please.
[129:01.28]Didn't think I was gonna make it down there without taking damage.
[129:03.80]Godmode ain't even on anymore.
[129:05.86]I'm like playing this like an FPS right now.
[129:10.68]Like a real FPS.
[129:11.64]Like these are other players.
[129:13.24]I'm stuck.
[129:39.79]My tongue is still out.
[129:40.91]Gross.
[130:07.85]Okay, where's the first one that I have to destroy?
[130:09.47]Is it right here?
[130:09.89]Am I in the room with it?
[130:13.73]No, it's this room right here.
[130:17.58]Oh, look, an energy cell.
[130:19.30]What's that?
[130:20.14]See ya.
[130:20.56]Oh, wait a minute.
[130:24.44]Monkey's power is destroyed.
[130:26.06]Rectacore overload in a matter of seconds.
[130:27.60]Okay, we'll blow it up.
[130:34.75]Why not?
[130:35.19]Come on.
[130:40.12]The bunker's power regulators, so I... Where are their power regulators?
[130:54.69]What the hell?
[130:59.77]Power regulators?
[131:03.56]These look like power regulators.
[131:12.93]Alright, here we go.
[131:15.07]Sayonara.
[131:15.65]Alright, got one.
[131:26.30]That's one, right?
[131:27.58]So, hold on.
[131:28.14]What if I don't have any more dynamite?
[131:34.64]Here comes a bunch of dudes.
[131:37.04]Gotta be prepared for them.
[131:48.83]We're safe.
[131:49.15]Alright.
[131:50.65]Safe.
[131:50.87]Just a quick save.
[131:51.73]Save it.
[131:54.81]Shotgun.
[131:55.43]Plasma pistol.
[131:57.63]I'll just shoot it with a pistol.
[132:13.60]Oh, fuck.
[132:14.02]I have a shit in my pants.
[132:16.38]Last one.
[132:17.74]Over here.
[132:26.35]I'm trying to sneak it.
[132:30.85]Yeah!
[132:32.05]There it is.
[132:34.05]Did it.
[132:34.55]Did it.
[132:35.09]Did it.
[132:36.51]Did it.
[132:37.01]What's going on?
[132:44.00]Uh.
[132:45.28]I gotta run, right?
[132:47.36]Where do I run to?
[132:47.94]I gotta run somewhere.
[132:52.24]Data.
[132:52.56]Map.
[132:53.36]Okay, I gotta go right.
[132:55.62]This way.
[132:56.89]Is that the way I have to go?
[133:27.49]What is going on?
[133:28.57]Why am I running so slow?
[133:32.37]No, throwing speed!
[133:39.67]I'm good.
[133:40.33]I'm good.
[133:48.48]Whoa.
[133:54.06]Alright.
[133:55.50]We're safe for now.
[133:57.75]Gentlemen, it was a pleasure serving under you.
[134:02.60]Save it.
[134:07.54]You've carried out Kaisar's will, but I must confiscate your equipment again.
[134:11.17]Oh, what a dick.
[134:14.45]Fine.
[134:18.53]I've super... Oh, my God.
[134:21.43]Yeah.
[134:21.88]How do I... Do I have anything to get rid of the rads?
[134:25.00]Do I need a rad saver?
[134:31.97]Rad-X.
[134:33.15]That's resistance.
[134:34.09]Do I have anything to get rid of it, though?
[134:45.56]I don't.
[134:46.86]Or do I?
[134:47.36]I have no idea.
[134:49.20]Give me some steak.
[134:50.68]Fuck, I just gave myself more radiation.
[134:52.18]That's great.
[134:52.60]Good job.
[134:56.34]Healing powder?
[134:58.59]Mosquitoes?
[134:59.71]MASH?
[135:02.97]Locksmith?
[135:03.57]Yeah.
[135:04.73]Med-X?
[135:05.23]No.
[135:08.07]Rad-Away?
[135:09.25]I don't have any Rad-Away.
[135:12.13]Well, I'm going to have to find it.
[135:13.29]Or buy it.
[135:19.67]I love how deviled eggs can wear off.
[135:29.10]I just really love a good deviled egg, you know?
[135:34.30]Hey, the only reason why I did this is so I can hang this guy.
[135:38.22]And fight him in one-on-one combat.
[135:40.60]And kick his ass.
[135:42.60]Slaves aren't much of a challenge in the arena.
[135:45.03]Bow down to your new leader.
[135:47.11]I did it.
[135:48.91]I felt the ground shake a while ago.
[135:51.57]I'll take that as a sign you've got the job done.
[135:54.79]There are rewards for doing as I command.
[135:57.39]Oh, I don't want to be with these guys.
[135:58.43]Today, your reward is vengeance.
[136:00.57]You get to decide how Benny dies.
[136:03.73]Okay.
[136:03.97]Thank you, Caesar.
[136:04.97]Okay.
[136:05.27]Hmm.
[136:05.43]How should I kill you?
[136:06.99]Shut up.
[136:07.65]None of your business.
[136:14.78]You'd die now.
[136:33.13]We'll fight in the arena, Ferris girl.
[136:34.94]You'll be crucified for my amusement.
[136:36.86]I'm going to kill you here.
[136:40.32]You'll fight in the arena with me.
[136:43.44]No, we're going one-on-one.
[136:51.04]I'm going to show him who the bigger man is.
[136:52.85]Yeah.
[137:00.17]Make it easy for me, please.
[137:02.05]I'm going to... I'm melee plus 70.
[137:04.87]That would be so funny if I could take a gun out.
[137:25.06]You like that?
[137:36.12]That was dumb.
[137:37.91]Let's fucking do the other thing to him.
[137:39.31]You'll be crucified for my amusement.
[138:08.48]But I do medicine.
[138:11.48]Let's watch.
[138:15.68]Where is he?
[138:19.39]Where is it?
[138:20.83]What?
[138:21.03]That one was even worse.
[138:22.09]It just says you kill this guy and he just disappears.
[138:24.45]Where is he?
[138:42.12]That's way worse.
[138:43.60]It didn't do anything.
[138:45.86]It just tells you it kills him.
[138:59.25]I don't see Benny anywhere, guys.
[139:01.42]What the fuck?
[139:12.48]Okay.
[139:19.34]I don't see anybody.
[139:27.60]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[139:28.28]That's a mistake.
[139:28.94]Don't go to... Wait, there he is.
[139:30.02]There he is.
[139:30.62]Found him.
[139:30.90]Scram, will ya?
[139:45.72]Looking up my, like, dress right now.
[139:48.88]No, where's my weapons?
[140:02.91]He's still alive!
[140:05.07]What?
[140:08.81]Are you serious?
[140:09.57]He's still alive?
[140:10.35]Okay.
[140:10.77]Alright, um...
[140:13.22]Why is he still alive?
[140:15.66]Shouldn't this not be happening?
[140:32.67]Come on!
[140:36.23]Are we going to slowly make it down alive?
[140:42.73]Okay, well, I guess I'm taking him with me.
[140:50.31]How far can I get him out of here?
[140:56.32]He doesn't have a health pool.
[141:02.70]Yeah, I don't think I can kill him.
[141:08.26]I don't.
[141:09.24]I'm hit!
[141:18.52]No, we're just gonna keep going.
[141:21.08]Oh, shit!
[141:21.88]No, he died!
[141:22.66]No!
[141:23.56]No!
[141:25.61]Fuck you.
[141:26.71]How dare you.
[141:27.39]Don't fucking ever look at me again.
[141:35.25]Ever.
[141:36.69]I mean ever again.
[141:43.08]See you later.
[141:47.76]What?
[141:50.02]Why would I target him?
[141:55.04]He just threw that in my face.
[142:02.45]Yeah, I get spammed.
[142:10.84]What am I doing?
[142:14.62]What happened?
[142:16.00]What happened?
[142:16.48]I need to go back.
[142:17.08]What happened?
[142:18.38]I...
[142:20.44]Hold on.
[142:24.12]Hold on.
[142:28.58]Calm down.
[142:30.48]Where am I?
[142:32.46]Okay.
[142:32.96]Okay.
[142:34.28]Thank you.
[142:37.04]Okay, we're good.
[142:43.88]Wait, what?
[142:44.90]No, yeah, okay.
[142:46.02]Let's take this...
[142:51.17]Like, I just don't know where I am.
[142:52.49]Just blacks out and, like, I get taken over by, like, a demon.
[142:55.67]No, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna... I wanna do that again because I wanna see if I can push him out.
[143:07.20]Is he roleplaying the guy from Memento?
[143:08.54]Pretty much, yeah.
[143:21.04]Confirm for goldfish.
[143:23.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[143:35.13]Yeah, we've done this like three times, you know?
[143:44.27]So, baby.
[143:44.87]What did... So, baby.
[143:47.53]What?
[143:48.39]You loser.
[143:49.54]He's gonna be a loser.
[143:52.57]Alright, let's go get you to be crucified for my amusement.
[143:59.46]You're fucking dead.
[144:01.26]Bye.
[144:01.56]Alright, what?
[144:06.36]No, I don't want to know your next task.
[144:08.23]I could care less.
[144:09.15]I want to go back to the actual quest line.
[144:12.81]Legion atrocities?
[144:14.27]Isn't this the legion?
[144:19.82]Buggin' access point of the wildcard.
[144:22.02]Return to Yes Man.
[144:22.98]Kill or decide.
[144:23.46]I can like... I don't know.
[144:24.10]I guess I'll talk to Caesar.
[144:26.98]Yeah, kill Mr. House.
[144:27.40]I will eliminate Mr. House.
[144:28.12]I will kill Mr. House.
[144:28.62]I am nothing but a soldier.
[144:51.34]I am nothing but a puppet and a ploy for you, my master.
[145:01.12]Is there a person that sells something here in this awful, terrible place?
[145:08.32]There's like a blacksmith here.
[145:09.36]These guys all suck.
[145:10.20]Why did I pick these guys?
[145:11.41]This is the worst faction.
[145:12.73]This sucks ass.
[145:29.69]Ofas!
[145:31.06]Welcome, Ofas.
[145:33.10]Thank you for your sub.
[145:34.80]Much appreciated.
[145:36.46]Hope you enjoy your stay.
[145:37.46]Welcome to the huge family.
[145:39.88]We have such a big family now.
[145:41.55]Wow.
[145:50.46]I do want to go kill Dr. House.
[145:52.78]That guy kind of annoys me.
[145:56.02]But I don't like these guys either.
[145:57.14]These guys are also annoying.
[146:02.29]Fuck, this was Dr. House for a second.
[146:04.09]Same guy.
[146:04.95]Alright, what do you have?
[146:08.75]I have so much money.
[146:11.13]Do you have stimpaks?
[146:13.03]Hey, you got any stimpaks?
[146:14.65]What about like Radaway?
[146:16.01]Do I need to go to a doctor or something?
[146:23.94]This guy's goods are terrible.
[146:29.13]This is terrible.

[148:08.77]Do you want to play a Hand of Caravan?
[148:10.57]Alright.

[148:23.34]Okay.
[148:31.34]Vault boy.
[148:31.94]Oh, here come the vault boys.
[148:38.64]Why are we doing vault boys?
[148:46.82]We're getting some vault boy.
[148:48.20]Oh, that's dope.
[148:48.76]Alright, Benny.
[148:54.12]So now I just...
[149:01.40]Somebody said that he has a gun.
[149:06.10]Where's his gun?
[149:07.50]Somebody's like, get his gun!
[149:08.52]Benny's got like the best gun in the world!
[149:16.15]Oh shit, this is gonna be dope.
[149:23.67]Now I can't cut him loose?
[149:28.28]There we go, he's loose now.
[149:34.13]I got nothing to say to you.
[149:37.09]I'm just fucking him up right now.
[149:38.77]I got nothing to say to you.
[149:43.53]Okay, I want his suit.
[149:53.47]Benny's suit.
[149:55.45]Put it on.
[150:00.05]Now I'm really snappy looking.
[150:08.88]I got nothing to say to you.
[150:10.50]I really want to just jump down.
[150:13.88]Why does it have to be so much fall damage?
[150:21.37]You have to kill him at the rent for his gun.
[150:23.47]Oh.
[150:24.17]Oh, whatever.
[150:27.05]Time to go kill Mr. House.
[150:29.73]And burn his house down.
[150:33.93]Where is that exactly?
[150:37.45]Oh, apparently it's this way.
[150:44.09]Cottonwood Cove.
[150:46.74]Oh, hello there.
[150:51.64]I'm ready to return to Cottonwood Cove.
[150:59.15]You've retrieved your confiscated items from the Dreadfort.
[151:04.15]Give me back my club.
[151:13.10]What's going on?
[151:15.48]218 into 230.
[151:15.80]What the hell?
[151:27.73]Oh, I hit the caps lock somehow, accidentally.
[151:29.53]How the hell did that happen?
[151:34.26]Now where to?
[151:34.76]Oh, we gotta go way up here.
[151:42.66]I guess I can just strip, right?
[151:47.35]Okay.
[151:48.73]Cool.
[151:51.37]Cool.
[151:55.28]I'm on the right quest, right?
[151:59.06]Kill Mr. House, yes.
[152:05.49]Although I should probably see a doctor.
[152:09.74]Where is the doctor?
[152:18.26]Whoa.
[152:19.79]Never trust a purple.
[152:22.85]Welcome, never trust a purple.
[152:25.51]Thank you.
[152:27.15]I need a doctor.
[152:27.99]Is she a doctor?
[152:28.63]No, I've got a... Yeah, I did it.
[152:31.01]Yeah.
[152:31.11]Oh, fuck.
[152:41.87]Never trust a purple.
[152:43.81]Are you a purple?
[152:44.43]Should we never trust you?
[152:47.98]At the end of the strip.
[152:51.82]But he, I could, no.
[152:52.86]I'm just gonna kill him.
[152:54.36]I'll be fine.
[152:56.94]Huh?
[152:59.18]There's a mole.
[152:59.76]They have a mole.
[153:00.46]They knew I was coming.
[153:01.16]Gonna make it to the elevator.
[153:10.98]This is actually not good.
[153:12.65]It's not good at all.
[153:19.65]Do I have anything I can shoot with?
[153:22.87]Shotgun recharger rifle?
[153:24.05]Do I have any ammo for it?
[153:27.69]No, I could shoot it.
[153:29.17]Target down.
[153:42.54]This sucks.
[153:48.59]Am I even hurting them?
[153:52.65]Barely.
[153:53.87]Not at all, but they're kind of dumb.
[154:07.00]This is not really working.
[154:16.18]What else we got?
[154:31.37]I don't...
[154:44.05]Whoa, what is shooting?
[154:45.57]What is doing that?
[154:46.62]What is, there's a grenade launcher guy.
[154:59.47]Stop drop and roll.
[155:00.95]Drop and roll.
[155:07.24]Shit.
[155:17.26]This sucks so bad.
[155:18.34]Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[155:21.25]What the fuck was that?
[155:23.11]What the hell was I just saying?
[155:24.17]Wow, wow, wow?
[155:29.43]This guy has the grenade launcher.
[155:36.45]He's only two people, by the way.
[155:38.21]I'm so dead.
[155:43.75]Crouch, you fucking idiot!
[155:50.46]Crouch, why do you keep doing that?
[155:51.76]This is the fucking worst thing ever.
[156:06.17]That was imp- that was just so bad.
[156:08.49]Fuck it.
[156:15.56]Why did I not just do that from the beginning?
[156:21.94]Are you kidding me?
[156:22.92]I just fucked them both up so bad.
[156:26.02]That was unbelievable how much I just destroyed them.
[156:30.54]I'm sitting there crouching behind shooting a little P-gun.
[156:35.73]Wait, wait, no.
[156:37.39]Dismiss all companions.
[156:38.45]Yes.

[158:24.30]Yes.
[158:26.36]What did I do?
[158:29.08]Yes, open it up.
[158:36.57]I opened up the antechamber.
[158:40.43]Should I not have done that?
[158:47.03]There's so many on this.
[158:49.63]Just spam.
[158:51.17]They're not going to be able to do it.
[158:52.59]They're too big to be in that corner.
[159:02.56]Just like that.
[159:03.12]That's how you do it.
[159:05.70]That is exactly how you do it.
[159:07.80]Alright.
[159:09.34]Where am I- where is he?
[159:11.34]Where's the guy that I have to kill?
[159:12.26]It says he's like right here.
[159:17.72]Is it the computer?
[159:21.10]Is he hiding in one of these machines?
[159:27.51]Where the fuck is this guy?
[159:37.99]Wait a minute.
[159:38.91]Oh, okay.
[159:39.17]There's another spot here.
[159:47.97]Excuse!
[159:56.58]Drink the fuck out of that.
[160:06.68]What's going on?
[160:08.23]Why am I in slow motion?
[160:11.53]What's going on?
[160:12.79]My arms are broken.
[160:15.97]My arms are broken.
[160:17.83]Both my arms are broken.
[160:45.95]I was shit-faced swinging around.
[160:49.09]Alright, open the fucking antechamber again.
[160:52.30]Let's go.
[160:59.18]Oh, it was right there.
[161:22.07]I can't play this game right now.
[161:32.17]That was so unexpected.
[161:33.33]He was just waiting for me, just like... That was fucking funny.
[161:46.88]God.
[161:48.52]What a mess.
[161:53.53]I feel like I'm walking in slow motion.

[162:36.41]Okay, Dr. House.
[162:39.01]Wait.
[162:39.37]Save it.
[162:39.65]Oh, power.
[162:42.51]Save it.
[162:44.17]You can't quick save while the game is paused?
[162:45.63]What are you talking about?
[162:46.23]Okay, there we go.
[162:46.59]Save it.
[162:47.93]Open the doors.
[162:49.01]This guy is toast.
[162:53.94]Let's go.
[162:54.28]Oh shit, they're coming behind me.
[162:57.25]Control room.
[163:01.39]Straight ahead.
[163:04.81]Oh, look who it is.
[163:07.03]What the fuck?
[163:10.12]He's a guy in like a breathe machine?
[163:14.88]How do I talk to him?
[163:19.24]Oh, unseal the chamber.
[163:23.61]Hello, Mr. House.
[163:30.04]Oh.
[163:31.36]Oh.
[163:33.38]What the hell?
[163:33.94]It's like Minority Report.
[163:36.76]What's wrong with this guy?
[163:38.02]Oh, this is terrible.
[163:41.73]Why have you done this?
[163:47.99]Centuries of preparation.
[163:52.27]I don't like you.
[164:06.18]Stupid.
[164:12.18]You won't be able to control anything, but I'll let you live.
[164:19.22]I'll put you back in your tube, good as new.
[164:23.28]No, this is like... No, you die.
[164:30.57]I got to think of a creative way to do this.
[164:45.49]I haven't left a lot of opportunities here.
[164:51.82]I could machete him.
[164:53.16]I could frag mine him.
[164:55.16]Yeah, we're going to frag mine him.
[164:57.60]We're going to make him be like, don't you fucking move.
[164:59.78]If he moves an inch, he's just going to die.
[165:02.08]I'm going to stick it right on his pelvis.
[165:06.80]Oh, God.
[165:08.12]He's still alive.
[165:08.64]Okay.
[165:09.12]Well, that didn't work.
[165:09.66]I just frisbeated into myself.
[165:15.74]Right.
[165:16.54]When he moves, he can't move.
[165:22.08]He doesn't move.
[165:25.78]Hold on.
[165:26.76]Can I put him back in?
[165:31.00]Sterilize the chamber?
[165:34.54]Shock him?
[165:36.20]No.
[165:36.50]I need to blow him up or something.
[165:41.61]Let him go and he runs.
[165:42.65]That would be fucking hilarious.
[165:47.75]He's got no health.
[165:55.56]This is killing him.
[166:01.36]Who's making that noise?
[166:11.55]Blow up!
[166:20.48]Oh god!
[166:22.64]That was terrible.
[166:23.66]Why did I do that?
[166:25.44]Quest failed?
[166:26.04]How did I fail it?
[166:36.05]Wait.
[166:37.09]What?
[166:39.23]Return to Caesar.
[166:40.23]Okay.
[166:44.73]Aha!
[166:45.63]I'm the winner on this one.
[166:46.69]Eat him.
[166:52.95]We had a couple of resubscriptions.
[166:56.47]Professor Ignatius for four months, and then PrincessAwesome85 for eight months.
[167:02.87]Welcome back, guys.
[167:05.63]Like I said before, I have to figure out what to do when people sub for a year.
[167:10.37]I don't know what to do.
[167:14.93]I'm not going to still get attacked, am I?
[167:21.32]Are these things friendly now?
[167:23.07]Because I killed their leader?
[167:24.97]Yeah, they are.
[167:26.45]Okay, good.
[167:28.25]Get me out of here.
[167:32.39]I'm crippled.
[167:33.07]I'm all screwed up.
[167:35.04]I just need to teleport back and get my free stuff.
[167:43.04]Free stuff.
[167:49.29]You can change your field of view.
[167:50.19]I already did before I even streamed the game for the first time.
[167:54.50]I did all like the I and I commands to make it so it was 90.
[167:59.62]I thought they worked.
[168:02.04]Could be wrong though.
[168:03.15]This looks like 90.
[168:03.61]Alright, let's go.
[168:09.49]Let's get out of here.
[168:18.79]Uh, world map.
[168:21.17]The fort!
[168:25.77]What are the chances of Jerma saying hi to me in particular?
[168:27.87]Hi, Bacon.
[168:28.31]LilacGaming12332Bacon.
[168:29.03]Just did it.
[168:29.59]I look like shit right now.
[168:31.05]Can one of you guys help me?
[168:32.13]Give me something.
[168:46.17]You're going to make an old man like me limping like this all the way up to the stupid chamber up there?
[168:54.59]I kind of want to just noclip up there.
[168:59.94]I'm not using any mods.
[169:00.92]No.
[169:03.14]Legion scum.
[169:03.82]I didn't even mean to be in the Legion.
[169:06.88]It told me to kill Benny.
[169:07.84]Benny was an asshole.
[169:08.62]He tried to kill me.
[169:09.44]And these guys captured him and I was just like, okay.
[169:12.36]I want to kill Benny.
[169:13.64]And I did what they said.
[169:16.64]I'm gonna turn on them.
[169:18.38]You heard what I said.
[169:19.56]I said I'm gonna fucking turn on you guys.
[169:21.90]The last second when I get everything I want from you, I'm throwing a saw blade like a disk into your leader's head.
[169:38.15]No, it's this way.
[169:42.09]I'm getting hungry, too.
[169:45.17]I'm a hungry boy.
[169:50.21]Move.
[169:51.69]You stupid idiot.
[169:54.59]What are you, stupid?
[169:58.32]What do I get for doing this?
[169:59.84]Besides XP.
[170:00.58]Is there eventually an exclusive item I get with these guys?
[170:04.26]Mm-hmm.
[170:10.85]With Mr. House out of the way, I can focus on smoothing out a few lingering complications elsewhere in the Mojave.
[170:18.91]First up are the boomers of Nellis Air Force Base.
[170:22.31]A tribe so reclusive, I want you to offer them an alliance with my legion.
[170:27.52]My terms are simple.
[170:29.28]Target their guns against the NCR side of the dam when I assault it, and they can keep their freedom.
[170:36.22]If you find they aren't amenable to this offer, destroy them.
[170:41.67]I want to just do me, not you.
[170:44.85]What's that machine?
[170:45.51]Really?
[170:46.21]Like me.
[170:46.45]Let me use it.
[171:10.60]Can I use this thing?
[171:17.40]What?
[171:18.04]Fuck you.
[171:19.34]What am I?
[171:19.66]What good are you?
[171:20.88]What good are any of you?
[171:21.86]It is a great honor for anyone outside the Legion to get an audience.
[171:32.07]Get out of here.
[171:33.39]I'm done with you guys.
[171:38.35]Am I going to take bits when it comes out of beta?
[171:41.63]Probably.
[171:42.05]I don't do, like, straight-up donations, so I guess maybe I'll just turn it on.
[171:47.01]I don't know.
[171:49.83]There's a lot of things that I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.
[171:52.45]I'm lost, guys.
[171:53.27]I'm lost at sea.
[171:55.37]Alright.
[171:56.39]Quests.
[171:59.44]Kill the boomers.
[172:00.36]Or I can do wild card.
[172:01.68]Return to yes man.
[172:02.80]I have the platinum chip.
[172:03.68]I could do that.
[172:08.75]Go back to Yes Man.
[172:10.45]He was a weirdo.
[172:17.17]I need to find like a medic too.
[172:19.78]That's very important.
[172:26.64]Alright.
[172:29.28]Where is there a medic?
[172:32.42]I need a doctor so bad.
[172:33.73]I need a doctor.
[172:39.98]Anybody, give me a doctor.
[172:42.24]Ugh, sorry.
[172:50.28]They keep killing people.
[172:52.00]It's not nice.
[172:52.56]Have you considered joining competitive TF2?
[172:58.88]Uh, well, considering I have not really played TF2 in just about like a year and a half, I don't think the answer to that question is yes.
[173:14.07]The place is too big for me to know where the hell I'm supposed to go.
[173:24.32]I'm watching you since 2012, Jerma.
[173:28.10]Keep up the laughs.
[173:29.48]Well, thanks, Stormflare.
[173:31.84]Glad to have you around for that long.
[173:40.52]Will you guys get mad at me if I just spawn, like, 20 Stimpaks?
[173:44.45]Just pretend like it never happened.
[173:48.99]I'm not supposed to be over here.
[173:57.10]Is there a doctor, like, in this area?
[173:58.46]Or are these just all strip clubs?
[174:06.81]joint competitive fallout.
[174:08.13]What?
[174:08.25]I have a few questions.
[174:09.43]Who are you?
[174:09.81]Hmm.
[174:10.17]Very impressive.
[174:10.71]How long have you been doing comedy?
[174:11.95]Yes.
[174:12.11]No wonder you were working the street, you shitty.
[174:14.81]Goodbye.
[174:38.68]Too bad you're not a doctor.
[174:44.17]No, no, everyone just said no.
[174:52.95]I have a shitload of money.
[174:53.83]I need to buy some equipment.
[174:57.95]I just don't know where to go to do that.
[175:00.65]And every time I look at the chat, I'm like late to look at it.
[175:02.85]It's like delayed.
[175:04.87]Sleeping in a bed.
[175:05.49]Yeah.

[176:15.04]Ah, bullshit.
[176:17.30]I'm only betting one chip.
[176:20.91]Max bet.

[178:25.89]Oh, here we go.

[180:05.67]Are there any even in here?
[180:06.57]I'm looking around like crazy.
[180:12.64]Are you a named doctor?
[180:14.92]Hold up.
[180:16.02]When people have got nothing left, they can always turn to the followers.
[180:19.62]No, you're a guard.
[180:21.32]God damn it.
[180:25.18]There's another doctor.
[180:27.26]Hi.
[180:31.07]If you're looking for metal... Not all followers are people.
[180:39.89]Out of sight.
[180:40.55]Though it has a noble...
[180:45.50]He won't heal me?
[180:46.90]Okay.
[180:47.04]Yeah.

[191:38.31]Oh, cutscene, cutscene.
[191:41.71]I feel like this is not a good thing to do.
[191:45.35]This guy's an evil, right?
[192:08.56]Okay, that was supposed to happen.
[192:10.52]He's gonna lock me in and gas me or something, isn't he?
[192:12.11]He's gonna lock me in and start sending laser beams at me.
[192:38.12]Yeah, I'm going to be like a prisoner.
[192:39.02]Stay closer to the demonstration area, please.

[192:48.57]Our titanium alloy housing does a good job of protecting our delicate electronic insides from small arms fire and shrapnel.
[192:55.39]Our left arm contains an X-25 Gatling laser.
[192:57.97]I don't care about any of this.
[192:59.25]Quite deadly against off-targets in medium range.
[193:01.47]That looks like fun.
[193:03.73]And for close-range suppression and crowd control...
[193:07.95]Can I sleep through this?
[193:09.33]Is there a bed nearby?
[193:10.11]Yawn.
[193:10.33]Imagine!
[193:34.29]Now watch this.
[193:35.79]I'm downloading the Mark II OS to all Securitrons on the network.
[193:39.03]Makes quite a difference.
[193:41.93]With the M235 missile launcher, we can engage ground and air targets at long range.
[193:46.30]Holy crap!
[193:47.88]And a rapid-fire G28 grenade launching system makes those deadly in close range engagements.
[193:53.78]Woo, look at that.
[193:55.90]Look at that.
[193:56.24]The OS upgrade also includes drivers for our onboard auto repair systems.
[193:59.56]Just try to hurt us now.
[194:02.10]Altogether, this software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness.
[194:09.71]I'm sure it does.
[194:10.45]Nice.
[194:10.93]Very cool.
[194:12.99]New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it.
[194:17.77]I hope you enjoyed this demonstration.
[194:19.51]You can come back up and see me or be on your way.
[194:21.82]I know you're a busy person.
[194:26.08]Okay.
[194:31.60]Beware the wrath of Caesar.
[194:34.38]Melee, melee, melee, melee, melee, melee, melee, melee, melee.
[194:39.04]Night person, mysterious stranger.
[194:40.62]Looks like it's a night person.
[194:44.76]Settles down against Petit, no misfortune.
[194:47.10]It's like a look of dudes who come out and attack.
[194:57.39]That's kind of cool.
[195:01.29]I like that.
[195:01.69]I like finesse.
[195:04.59]Yeah.
[195:06.31]Doing finesse.
[195:06.83]Challenging?
[195:08.59]What do you mean it's challenging?
[195:22.97]For a second, I thought that said, so I should ask these tribes if they'll support an independent vegan?
[195:27.92]I was like, what does that mean?
[195:30.46]Am I a vegan in this game?
[195:33.48]Mm-hmm.
[195:33.74]Shape the future of vegans.
[195:34.52]Do I get to be God?
[195:58.55]There's a bunch.
[195:59.93]I think you should visit the other families on this.
[196:02.13]Okay.
[196:03.25]We can talk about something else later.
[196:05.15]So now I have this quest.
[196:09.03]The Legion has spies everywhere.
[196:10.47]If you continue to work against its interest, you will be marked an enemy.
[196:14.92]Didn't I just do a bunch of stuff for Caesar?
[196:17.50]Didn't I just do this?
[196:25.60]So now everyone's after me.
[196:33.16]I don't know what to do now.
[196:38.53]I'm sort of picking my battles at this point, right?
[196:44.49]I can either do the Caesar's thing.
[196:47.85]Talk to the Brotherhood of Steel and do something for them.
[196:51.19]Spread word of the Legion's atrocities.
[196:55.34]Hmm.
[197:00.44]Uh...
[197:07.40]Alright.
[197:08.46]Give me a second.
[197:09.08]I'm gonna get some fucking tea.
[197:10.98]I need some tea to think about this, and I have to, like, send a message.
[197:15.16]I'm getting some tea, BRB.
[197:16.14]I need to make this a little bit bigger so people know.
[197:22.10]I'm getting some tea.
[197:25.22]I'll be back.
[197:27.12]I'll be back.
[197:27.48]BRB.
[201:23.98]Hey, I'm back.
[201:27.88]Did I wake you up?
[201:31.20]Let's go get some tea.
[201:33.57]Hold on a second.
[201:35.73]Close that out.
[201:36.81]There we go.
[201:42.59]What's it doing?
[201:47.22]My tea gets too loud?
[201:48.34]Oh, is it?
[201:48.72]Well... Wait!
[201:51.18]What?! !
[201:53.36]Dango slapper these are the five months dude.
[201:57.40]Hey welcome back Speed begun is so useless, but it's funny to have a funny joke This is also like a funny joke, but I can't throw it away Whatever
[202:23.75]Alright.
[202:24.99]Um... I really just don't know what the hell to do now.
[202:32.23]It opened up for me too much.
[202:39.41]So I can go here, here, or here.
[202:41.21]What's, like, right here?
[202:44.33]Go to the NCR shareholders farm.
[202:52.34]Wait!
[202:53.08]What?! !
[202:55.96]Ricina or Richina says, I love you, Jerma.
[202:58.82]Oh.
[202:59.66]Call me a cool dude and my life will be accomplished.
[203:02.27]Oh, it's Richie.
[203:03.23]Richie NA.
[203:04.39]Well, dude, Richie NA.
[203:06.99]You're a cool dude.
[203:08.93]You're one of the coolest I've heard through the grapevine.
[203:15.28]Um.
[203:17.17]Am I paying Holy Mac?
[203:18.23]Yeah, Holy Mac with a third is going to be the editor for all these Twitch clips.
[203:23.27]And there are a lot of them.
[203:25.06]And he's going to be the guy that puts a bunch of them together.
[203:29.80]And he's going to be compensated for it.
[203:32.44]It's a little bit of a joint venture.
[203:38.32]He's an editor.
[203:40.11]And he's going to be the editor for the Twitch highlights.
[203:44.59]That should be pretty much set in stone.
[203:47.65]And I can start uploading things.
[203:49.87]That he puts together in the next couple... Over the next couple days I would say.
[203:54.86]Probably like within the next week.
[203:56.42]I'd say.
[204:04.72]Let's go... I'm just gonna go here.
[204:07.58]Let's go to the shareholders farm.
[204:14.45]Wait, what?
[204:17.49]Yay, DPS poison, thanks for two months.
[204:20.79]Welcome back for the two months.
[204:25.01]Oh, ow.
[204:28.91]So I'll probably go for like another 45 minutes.
[204:31.56]I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, so I won't be able to go to it and not stay up too late.
[204:38.04]We'll cap it at like a solid four hours.
[204:43.66]So what is this?
[204:46.62]Straight ahead?
[204:50.56]Okay.
[204:55.90]Good boy points.
[204:56.78]Is this just a lady?
[205:06.58]Make it 47 minutes and you get a deal?
[205:08.58]Well, stream highlights go to a different channel.
[205:23.62]Probably not.
[205:25.64]Probably not.
[205:27.14]Because here's a philosophy for my channel going forward.
[205:31.89]Well, I guess we can pause here and just talk about it for a second.
[205:37.55]I obviously have been streaming a lot these last few months.
[205:41.37]And I feel like we've seen some pretty fun stuff.
[205:45.36]And it's a lot of... I mean, if I wasn't streaming, I would be...
[205:52.76]recording like this same stuff I would be doing off kind of camera, recording by myself.
[206:00.38]There's gonna be a Fallout New Vegas video.
[206:03.14]There'll be a Fallout New Vegas video from all this crazy shit that we've seen.
[206:07.30]But the philosophy going forward is because I've been streaming and not like recording games, this is like what I'm gonna be doing.
[206:19.62]Once in two weeks equals a lot.
[206:21.74]I was at E3.
[206:23.34]I was at E3 and then I had to go to a wake and a funeral.
[206:26.97]Because a very close family friend passed away.
[206:31.63]That's where I've been for the last couple of weeks.
[206:32.93]First it was E3 and then that happened.
[206:34.79]It was unfortunate that it happened.
[206:36.89]That's why I haven't been around for a couple of weeks.
[206:38.83]The last two or three weeks straight.
[206:40.60]But before that, I was streaming at least three or four times a week.
[206:44.10]And it's something I'm just going to keep doing.
[206:45.50]Anyways.
[206:47.12]Anyways.
[206:49.21]My channel is going to be a lot of stream highlights from now on.
[206:53.37]And... Big, high, high production value videos.
[206:59.66]So, you'll get, like, good condensed highlights from... Because, like I said, it's something I would have done anyways.
[207:09.00]I'm sorry.
[207:09.46]I appreciate it.
[207:10.20]It's... It's okay.
[207:14.13]It's alright.
[207:15.63]It was sad, but...
[207:18.05]I mean, it's this weird thing we call life, right?
[207:23.38]But to get away from that topic, I don't really want to dwell on it that much.
[207:29.73]I want my channel to be very, very, very high production value videos.
[207:34.67]For instance, like, the one that I'm working on now is going to be what I want, like, quote, videos to be on the channel.
[207:41.98]So, like, once every couple months, you'll get, like, a, like, a video.
[207:48.00]Not just, like, oh, I'm, uh, gonna jump in Fallout and record for, like, 10 hours and cut it up and make a vid.
[207:52.88]Like, that's gonna be stream stuff.
[207:55.50]Once every couple months, you're gonna get a actual, quote, like, video production.
[208:00.86]And that's, like, where the direction is gonna go.
[208:08.80]But videos will be on the channel.
[208:10.82]Way more videos are going to be on my YouTube channel.
[208:12.50]Let's just put it that way.
[208:22.09]What am I doing in here?
[208:26.51]No, not really.
[208:29.17]Was I supposed to go in here?
[208:33.83]Talk to this guy.
[208:35.65]Glad you're with us.
[208:38.42]It's a complete channel redirect.
[208:39.83]Well, I mean, like, what I'm doing right now is what I did do on my channel.
[208:44.11]I just didn't stream it.
[208:47.03]You know?
[208:49.23]Like, think about all the time, like, all the time you've seen me in, like, those of you that saw, like, weeks ago when I was playing Fallout.
[208:56.32]I would do that off stream.
[208:58.58]And then I would cut it up and make a video.
[209:03.54]But because I'm essentially broadcasting that process...
[209:08.88]It's, you know, it's a lot easier to have somebody help with editing for that while I can focus on the big, big projects that I want to do once every month or two.
[209:20.93]I'm kind of just walking around in circles.
[209:22.25]Is there, like, a person of interest down here that I have to talk to?
[209:26.10]Is this the drunk guy?
[209:36.54]The guy I got to...
[209:38.43]Hold on, let me look at what this says.
[209:44.80]White?
[209:45.24]Okay, Ultra Lux.
[209:47.46]That's Ultra Lux.
[209:51.51]Jeremy getting lazy?
[209:52.43]No, actually the complete opposite.
[209:56.25]Like, you're still gonna get, like, the highlight kind of play games videos.
[210:01.77]In the meantime, I'm gonna be working on actual, like, go and film shit videos.
[210:10.78]Complete opposite.
[210:11.96]I can assure you.
[210:17.73]Yeah, you can take my guns.
[210:18.51]I don't care.
[210:22.88]Had a couple of subs.
[210:24.02]Spartan Caboose567, thanks for two months.
[210:29.21]And UserJJB, thank you for two months.
[210:31.33]I'm going to talk to a leader of the White Glove Society.
[210:41.85]House is dead.
[210:42.93]This time for good.
[210:47.99]I'm sorry.
[210:48.59]I prefer to converse with interesting people.
[210:51.21]These people are fucking weirdos.
[210:59.55]But what this will do is it'll make uploads much less erratic.
[211:06.50]Is this Easy Pete?
[211:09.34]Oh, I saw like the top hat and like the overalls.
[211:12.72]I saw his hat and overalls and I thought top hat.
[211:14.54]I don't know what top hat is.
[211:16.90]Why is there a leader?
[211:17.54]Yeah, I saw him here.
[211:18.88]Uh, he's over in the bathhouse wearing a skimpy two-piece bathing suit.
[211:22.12]This guy sounds like a Steve Brule name.
[211:23.57]Heck Gunderson.
[211:47.95]The Legion better watch out now.
[211:49.69]Our rangers are going to turn the tables around.
[211:52.33]I'm looking for just a named person in here.
[211:55.53]Are you a named person?
[211:56.89]Marjorie has done a remarkable job managing the restoration.
[211:59.62]I guess I gotta go into like the actual hotel room.
[212:08.02]Is there a hotel room back here?
[212:10.84]No.
[212:14.28]What about you?
[212:15.84]Hey!
[212:16.30]How may I be of service, sir?
[212:21.13]My, such a popular question.
[212:24.21]I suppose it is only natural to see us and wonder what it is that makes us special.
[212:29.53]Yeah, I thought about it.
[212:32.17]Somebody said make a second channel, potentially.
[212:35.37]I feel like it's a little too late for that.
[212:40.01]I don't want to break up everybody at this point.
[212:43.54]I'd rather just put everything on one channel and have people aware that that's what's going on.
[212:48.98]And now, here we are.
[212:51.48]not everyone can wear the finest clothes but surely we can agree that the most tasteful sophisticated people are the most deserving okay I do but I need someone I know perhaps if you made more of a name for yourself around the strip have you not heard about me I've done so many crazy things have you how do you not know who I am oh boy
[213:20.10]More about the white gloves.
[213:21.18]I don't want to... Talk about eradicating people.
[213:25.35]How do you fare?
[213:25.95]I feel like this is one of the eradication... Eradications.
[213:35.38]Where's Marjorie?
[213:42.62]Listen to me, son!
[213:45.11]I'm your dad!
[213:51.73]Dirty diaper man.
[213:53.17]Welcome, dirty diaper.
[213:54.19]Thanks a lot.
[213:54.61]Welcome to the family.
[213:58.45]Welcome to the seventh amigo.
[213:59.35]Is she in a different room or something?
[214:28.22]Marjorie.
[214:30.96]Kind of feel like I'm just walking around in circles right now.
[214:34.88]Make a fourth channel that's kids reacting to your second channel videos.
[214:39.56]I'm getting the hell out of here.
[214:45.48]I mean, eh.
[214:51.63]I have a lot of options right now, but did any of them, like, lead to anything?
[214:55.19]Or are they all just side quests?
[215:01.27]I think I'm going to play Blackjack again at the other casino.
[215:04.12]ASMR video.
[215:14.31]Let's go to this one.
[215:23.02]Give me some chips.
[215:23.98]Uh-huh.
[215:30.63]Chips, chips, chips, chips, chips.
[215:36.31]I would like a thousand chips.
[215:39.50]Let's do it.
[215:40.00]Slot machines.
[215:41.62]You know how it is, guys.
[216:00.46]Come on.
[216:06.36]We're the 40% more vacation boys.
[216:09.54]Oh, they're coming!
[216:15.93]Come!
[216:20.95]Give me... 777.
[216:32.68]I got three grapes last time.
[216:33.82]Will the videos be coming soon?
[216:40.59]Yes.
[216:43.51]Very, very, very, very, very, very, very soon.
[216:47.61]Come on!
[216:48.09]No!
[216:57.46]Damn it!
[216:59.18]Where the fuck is the Ellen Degeneres machine?
[217:00.80]I got a lot of luck on that one.
[217:03.32]Ooh, 120 chips.
[217:03.68]Ooh.
[217:03.78]Kind of running out of money here.
[217:11.62]I have high luck too, don't I?
[217:18.07]This is dumb.
[217:20.71]Alright, we're out.
[217:21.95]We're out.
[217:22.67]We're gonna go play blackjack.
[217:26.43]Max bet.

[218:16.45]Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[218:20.53]You have literally three luck.
[218:21.83]I thought I had, like, finesse two or something.
[218:24.22]That's all I have?
[218:25.28]Bullshit.
[218:27.64]But thank you again, Jogaza.
[218:31.98]Double down.
[218:40.76]13.
[218:40.96]Double down.
[218:42.58]What's going on here?
[218:48.40]8, 9, 10, 11.
[218:48.94]11, I lose.
[218:49.54]Okay.
[218:55.98]I'm up.
[218:56.88]I'm up almost 1,200, guys.
[219:00.80]Double down.
[219:06.21]Deal again.
[219:07.69]Is that 11?
[219:08.69]Couple down.
[219:09.05]21.
[219:10.31]Oh, broke even.
[219:15.11]Deal it out.

[219:15.51]Fucking 20?
[219:16.09]300 chips.
[219:16.95]Let's get to 3,000.
[219:17.68]Hit me.
[219:18.04]Hit me.
[219:23.10]Hit me.
[219:36.15]Ah!
[219:37.75]That's a five card.
[219:38.69]Did I just say it smells like shit?
[219:45.17]Did he just say I smell like shit and that's why he kicked me out?
[219:52.48]Oh wow, it smells like shit in here.
[220:03.85]I got some more money.
[220:04.77]Alright, where are the max slots?
[220:10.29]Where are the super slots?
[220:15.24]Can I bet, like, more than that?
[220:17.18]Oh, exit.
[220:17.58]Let's get some cash out.
[220:20.28]Let's get the hell out of here.
[220:24.81]I have so many caps.
[220:26.29]This is fantastic.
[220:27.05]I can buy literally whatever I want.
[220:33.09]Smells like shit and booze and sex in here.
[220:43.98]So... Legion money?
[220:45.96]NCR money?
[220:46.66]Why would you want that besides caps?
[220:52.45]Is there a reason to take it in NCR money or something?
[220:55.99]Damn.
[221:00.85]Which one do I have now?
[221:06.09]Damn.
[221:06.83]Oh, damn.
[221:09.51]60.
[221:09.59]Almost 6,300 caps.
[221:16.07]RP reason, I'd assume.
[221:18.99]Put it all on blood.
[221:29.52]Welcome to Gamora.
[221:36.67]Where is it?
[222:13.90]What the fuck?
[222:15.86]I can't go higher than 200?
[222:19.22]Why can I not go higher than 200?

[222:39.69]Why am I only allowed to do that?
[222:50.91]Can I just do it multiple times?
[222:55.44]You have to win a ton to get on the hut.
[222:57.94]Easy.
[223:00.56]Do I just have to keep winning blackjack?
[223:03.24]I want to get in that high roller room.

[226:13.07]You do realize if I hit this, I'm gonna make what?
[226:19.69]Nah, I got an epiphany.
[226:21.49]Just went on 19.
[226:21.99]It's a Ouija board.
[226:29.83]Watch this.
[226:30.69]Putting my hands on it.
[226:31.37]Ouija board.
[226:31.97]Let the spirits decide where it's going.
[226:36.99]Oh, oh.
[226:38.11]Feeling tons of energy over here.
[226:41.64]Wow.
[226:42.94]So... Tons of energy right there.
[226:46.44]31.
[226:46.54]Black.
[226:47.94]It was just calling me.
[226:48.82]It was sucking me in.
[226:49.46]There was so much energy.
[226:50.58]31.
[226:50.60]Black.
[226:52.44]I knew that.
[226:52.76]There was a 3.
[226:53.60]See?
[226:53.74]There was a 3 in that one.
[226:55.42]It was the 3 that was pulling me.
[227:00.14]I hope my intuitions are correct.
[227:02.36]Whoa.
[227:02.98]Whoa.
[227:04.34]I felt it over here.
[227:04.92]9.

[227:05.54]Red.
[227:06.36]See?
[227:06.96]It was 3, 6, 9.
[227:08.22]It was divisible of 3.
[227:12.72]17.
[227:12.84]Then it went on 9 again.
[227:45.32]Double zero.
[227:46.08]Give me double zero.
[227:59.36]I don't know what I put it on.
[228:00.54]What did I put it on?
[228:03.46]I don't know what it's on.
[228:07.22]15?
[228:07.46]What was it on?
[228:25.04]I split it.
[228:28.88]I fucking split it.
[228:32.15]I think I split it.
[228:33.63]What number did it go?
[228:51.64]Double zero and get me out of here.
[228:54.00]Oh, you fucker!
[228:55.42]That was so close.
[229:11.29]Let's go.
[229:15.63]I can't, I can't, I...
[229:36.25]It hurts.
[229:38.93]No, pick it up.
[229:39.45]Pick it up.
[229:42.17]Pick it up.
[229:44.99]Fuck.
[229:58.49]It's time to stop.
[229:59.45]It's time to stop.
[230:01.33]We're done after this one.
[230:02.75]This is the final one.
[230:04.01]It's going to take me wherever I'm going.
[230:09.96]Let's see where it wants me to go.
[230:11.10]Right here.
[230:16.44]11.
[230:17.36]Done.
[230:17.74]Go.
[230:23.23]It fucking landed in 0.
[230:28.09]It bounced into 11.
[230:28.93]Wait, that wasn't even 11, was it?
[230:30.59]It was 16.
[230:30.79]What?
[230:30.89]What?
[230:41.39]No, I don't want two on 16.
[230:43.17]That was their last one.
[230:44.79]Why are there two chips on 16?
[230:49.47]I fucking... It did double zero.
[230:53.19]It did zero, zero, double zero.
[230:55.72]It's taunting me now.
[230:57.94]Thanks a lot, Geminisha.
[230:59.32]Geminisha.
[231:00.18]Gemintia.
[231:03.06]I'm being taunted.
[231:04.34]It's gonna do zero again.
[231:16.00]This is the last one.
[231:18.90]This is the last one.
[231:19.54]It's gonna do double zero now.
[231:21.18]Now it doesn't think I'm gonna do double zero.
[231:23.14]It's like... It's playing with me now.
[231:25.32]It's gonna hit double zero.
[231:26.03]Let me add a hit quick.
[231:35.45]No, it's... Evening.
[231:44.78]Okay.
[232:15.67]No, I'm not doing this right now I want to make like 20 grand The only way you do that is on the roulette table
[232:35.60]Bar, bar, bar.
[232:37.92]Bar, bar, bar, or seven, seven, seven.
[232:42.44]That's not what I wanted.
[232:43.32]That's not what I wanted.
[232:50.09]Nope.
[233:06.21]Wait, what?
[233:09.41]Unloading both.
[233:10.31]Ten luck equals free money from casinos.
[233:17.77]I want to get the big hit.
[233:22.87]Once I get the big hit, then I can go to bed.
[233:25.15]I can't turn this stream off until I go to bed.
[233:28.58]What?
[233:31.52]I can't turn this stream off until I hit big.
[233:33.84]And we're talking like a big two to three thousand hit.
[233:47.21]But thank you unloading wolf for the two months.

[234:49.22]Give yourself max luck?
[234:50.32]No, then people will make fun of me.
[234:52.52]People will say that I'm a bad gamer.
[234:54.24]They'll be like, you suck, dude.
[234:55.92]You have to cheat to win.
[234:57.37]And I'm just gonna be like, I know, I'm sorry.

[235:46.73]That was only AT.
[235:47.93]Exactly.
[235:51.01]One more big hit.
[235:56.64]Big hit.
[235:57.98]Big hit.
[235:59.28]It's only 600.
[236:01.86]That was awful.
[236:03.30]Don't ever give me the Benjamin Franklin bell again.
[236:12.97]Back to the roulette table.
[236:13.95]Double zero is calling.
[236:15.71]You better believe it.
[236:19.05]How many knives have you won?
[236:23.13]CS, go.

[236:40.72]No, this is fake money.
[236:41.66]It's not even real money.
[236:50.88]This chat's going as fast as it slots.
[236:53.16]I'm at 8,000 chips right now, guys.
[236:59.35]It's close.
[237:05.35]I need to get to 10,000 before I go back to the roulette table.
[237:10.80]Big hit right here.
[237:11.76]This is the big one.
[237:12.76]7, 7, 7.
[237:24.05]Alright, we got three more poles.
[237:29.21]Starting now.

[237:43.22]Oh, that, that.
[237:43.96]One more.
[237:44.72]It was trying to tell me something.
[237:48.76]After that one.
[237:49.48]One more.
[237:54.05]I'd say that was like a little like, oh, you want 120?
[237:55.45]That's one more.
[237:55.89]I got this one.
[237:56.41]And that one.
[238:05.19]And that one.
[238:12.06]I can't stop.
[238:14.12]I can't stop.
[238:16.66]It's taking over my body.
[238:18.50]I can't stop pulling it.
[238:23.21]Nothing I can do.
[238:24.61]I'm stuck here forever.
[238:25.35]I will be here forever.
[238:27.61]I will be here in perpetuity.
[238:36.85]Three cherries, come on.
[238:39.01]Three, okay, go.
[238:41.41]Go, get out.
[238:44.05]Alright.

[239:10.35]It keeps hitting it.
[239:11.49]It keeps hitting it.
[239:12.51]Bouncing out.
[239:13.25]Go.
[239:13.93]Double zero.
[239:14.87]Double zero.
[239:15.43]Double zero.
[239:16.01]Double zero.
[239:16.53]Double zero.
[239:22.56]It tapped it.
[239:23.24]Yeah, I saw it.
[239:24.14]It got up.
[239:24.44]Tapping it.
[239:24.90]It went flying over.
[239:26.50]It's going to happen.
[239:27.00]You notice.
[239:28.74]Shit.
[239:28.96]I don't want to do that.
[239:33.36]Un-fucking-believable.
[239:34.16]I hate this game.
[239:35.42]I hate it.
[239:36.26]I hate this game.
[239:37.30]Why do I continue to play it?
[239:38.84]Lord.
[239:39.70]Lord in heaven.
[239:42.92]Alright, we're not going underneath 7,000.
[239:44.44]This is it.
[239:47.08]We're taking 7,000.
[239:48.36]I'm high as balls, but hey, what's up, Mr. Banana Man?
[239:51.48]Again, it hit it again.
[239:52.30]It's doing this on purpose.
[239:53.42]13, two times in a row.
[239:55.81]But Mr. Bananasham, Mr. Bananasham, thank you for four months.
[239:59.00]Welcome back.

[240:08.07]It's going on double zero.
[240:17.18]This is seriously the last one.
[240:18.86]And I'm out.
[240:19.88]For good.
[240:20.64]And I'm... It's it.
[240:23.25]I'm ending the stream after this one.
[240:24.95]No matter what it is.
[240:25.57]No matter what.
[240:26.87]You know what, game?
[240:40.25]Fuck you.
[240:57.68]You want me to put it on every single one?
[240:59.10]Why not?
[241:08.83]I win.
[241:10.79]Did I?
[241:13.11]What?
[241:13.67]I thought I had one on 28.
[241:32.24]This is it.
[241:32.72]I gotta stop this.
[241:34.20]I'm done.
[241:34.62]Zero.
[241:34.94]It's gonna get me with the one zero this time.
[241:44.65]You moved that one.
[241:46.75]Come on.
[241:47.51]Here we go.
[241:49.47]I know how to win.
[241:50.47]I'll show you how to win, guys.
[241:51.31]100 on red.
[241:53.89]100 on black.
[241:56.09]I can't fucking lose.
[242:02.07]I almost just shit my pants that it was gonna go into zero.
[242:07.03]I break even.
[242:09.43]Mm-hmm.
[242:21.89]Double fucking zero!
[242:27.15]It was so close!
[242:29.61]It was close!
[242:33.71]If this hits, you know you're going to hear it.
[242:47.18]What am I doing?
[242:47.56]What am I doing?
[242:51.96]I was trying to find an exit, but I didn't want to just exit the game.
[243:08.14]Where's it saved?
[243:08.62]I don't know.
[243:09.86]I don't know where it's saved.
[243:17.62]Is that table?
[243:20.04]Where's the table?
[243:20.60]That table sucked.
[243:22.26]Gotta go to another table.
[243:29.07]I just need to take your money.
[243:31.55]Whatever you have.
[243:33.25]I'm so addicted to gambling.
[243:34.25]I can't help it.

[244:49.98]You guys wanna play- What?
[244:56.29]Hold on, I'm gonna sit down and play like Blackjack.
[245:01.53]They're still just fighting.
[245:05.90]Can I just sit down at one of these slot machines?
[245:19.30]Oh, I'm just sitting at the slot machine.
[245:21.38]Hopefully I win big tonight.
[245:22.74]They can't knock me off?
[245:29.91]Alright, guys.
[245:30.25]That's it.
[245:32.97]I'm done.
[245:45.04]I'm done.
[245:45.56]It was fun.
[245:51.39]It was fun while it lasted.
[245:52.69]Now I gotta take these guys out before I end the stream.
[246:03.23]Is he hitting me from back there?
[246:10.21]Something ain't right here.
[246:15.41]The sad part is Jeremy made money.
[246:19.52]I did.
[246:19.94]I made good money.
[246:20.84]I made like $7,000.
[246:21.50]Well, like $6,000 or something.
[246:26.42]Is there anybody left in here?
[246:32.40]Actually people.
[246:34.18]This guy's chasing after something.
[246:37.86]Get out of the way.
[246:42.51]You know what?
[246:46.78]You know what?
[246:47.18]That's a good point.
[246:48.12]That's a good point.
[246:50.51]That's a good point.
[246:51.49]With all this carnage, double zero.
[246:55.83]Last bet on double zero with all these deathclaws everywhere.
[246:58.61]This is the one.
[247:14.11]I was getting some tea.
[247:18.53]Good night, guys.
[247:20.71]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[247:27.52]I'll talk to you guys soon.
[247:29.78]I might stream a little bit more tomorrow.
[247:31.90]If not, then I don't know.
[247:33.24]There's a couple of games that I want to play on stream.
[247:37.14]I want to put the rest of this video together, though.
[247:39.12]And hopefully put a video on my YouTube channel.
[247:43.47]Have a good night, guys.
[247:44.39]Thanks to all you guys for sticking around and watching.
[247:46.96]If you're new to the stream, hi.
[247:49.50]My name was Jerma.
[247:52.04]I do this sometimes and we can hang out.
[247:55.14]Good night.
[247:56.04]Good luck.
[247:57.26]Thanks, everybody.
[247:57.68]Goodbye.
[248:44.77]Those damn bots are gone for good.
[248:50.22]They thought I was leaving.
[248:51.72]The gods thought I was leaving.
[248:55.35]Oh!
