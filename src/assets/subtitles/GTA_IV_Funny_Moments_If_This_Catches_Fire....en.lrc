[00:08.63]No.
[00:09.95]No?
[00:10.95]Anytime Boo is silent for more than five minutes, it means he's going to appear overhead.
[00:16.13]And start barraging us.

[06:51.97]Uh-oh.
[06:53.47]I don't think we're going to get in this helicopter this time.
[06:55.43]Oh, no.
[06:56.15]I just made it to the chopper.
[06:59.34]Oh, no.
[06:59.84]Oh.
[07:02.84]Dude, how dangerous do we have to be where the pilots don't even communicate?
[07:08.92]They're just driving into each other.
