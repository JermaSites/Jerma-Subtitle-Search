[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.21]Hey guys.
[00:03.45]What's up?
[00:04.35]How are you?
[00:08.25]We're here.
[00:09.61]Currently.
[00:12.29]Live.
[00:14.46]Technically live.
[00:17.92]I cannot guarantee that we're going to be live for very long.
[00:23.38]We've had cocks at the house for the last like six straight days.
[00:31.20]And, uh, they may have figured out one of the issues.
[00:35.49]So.
[00:36.77]It's just like the first Red Dead stream.
[00:38.49]That's right.
[00:40.59]We'll see how long we can go.
[00:42.75]This is gonna be one of those mystery boxes that you open.
[00:45.76]The stream might be two hours.
[00:49.06]It might be ten minutes.
[00:50.60]It might be six hours.
[00:51.94]I don't know.
[00:53.94]I can't see a mystery.
[00:55.48]Just literally RNG the stream.
[00:56.99]Ah, no, we're already dead.
[00:59.57]No, no, we're okay.
[01:00.39]Are we?
[01:02.32]No?
[01:02.60]Hey.
[01:04.14]I'm here.
[01:05.30]We just almost dropped, though.
[01:07.56]Hey!
[01:09.26]That's probably gonna happen like every 15 minutes.
[01:12.30]One minute.
[01:16.44]Oh, shit.
[01:18.66]Alright, I'm gonna press the button.
[01:22.82]It's probably gonna do that.
[01:26.48]So, let's ride it out here for as long as we can.
[01:31.32]I'll do my... do my best to... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh, this is getting ugly.
[01:45.43]And before he moves back.
[01:47.97]No, there's no going back.
[01:55.29]Damn, it was just green for so long, too.
[02:02.75]It was just so solid green, and now it just doesn't want to do it.
[02:08.15]What's with the music?
[02:08.83]You might be hearing the PS4 sound effects.
[02:14.52]Let's see.
[02:19.94]It's there.
[02:23.44]Moved on from Comcast and got worse internet.
[02:27.16]I have no idea.
[02:28.82]It's almost like a bad joke at this point.
[02:32.91]Because this is a gigabit line.
[02:37.39]This is a thousand megabits per second down.
[02:41.50]This is what we get for down.
[02:44.38]They just have some major, major issues.
[02:49.14]That apparently take a lot of work to solve.
[02:53.23]This is happening way more frequently than it just was.
[03:07.03]Nice.
[03:07.62]Already buffering.
[03:08.42]Getting a buffering pop-up already.
[03:14.22]Yeah.
[03:15.90]Well, just hang out with me for a minute.
[03:19.40]We'll sit here for a moment.
[03:23.55]Because we do get these spots of like a few hours where it's perfectly fine.
[03:30.73]I'm getting back in a balloon.
[03:32.00]I'm going back to Boston.
[03:34.92]Let's see, what if I take this screen off?
[03:36.34]What if I do this?
[03:38.98]Like, you can see that, right?
[03:43.88]Because that's Red Dead right there.
[03:49.24]Come on, just like feed me through to the line that I need to be on.
[03:57.50]So I cannot guarantee the authenticity of this current stream.
[04:03.45]And I'm so afraid to press the story button.
[04:08.07]I'm gonna press X and it's gonna crash the fucking node.
[04:12.75]What, a social club?
[04:13.67]I think it's the Rockstar thing that you get online, right?
[04:24.52]Press X?
[04:25.44]Should I?
[04:25.74]I'm so scared.
[04:28.44]I'm so scared that it's not gonna work.
[04:31.42]Shit, here goes the node.
[04:35.78]I'm doing it.
[04:36.24]I don't care.
[04:39.80]I will fight through the frame drops here.
[04:43.52]Because you guys wouldn't even believe.
[04:44.93]This is nothing.
[04:48.21]We would lose internet for 12 straight hours.
[04:50.41]It would just be zero.
[04:51.19]Alright, I'm going.
[04:55.63]Here we go.
[04:57.25]Wish me luck.
[04:57.65]Ready?
[04:59.57]One.
[05:01.37]Two.
[05:02.99]I did it.
[05:07.51]Okay.
[05:10.01]Okay.
[05:17.05]I'll turn it up a little bit.
[05:23.58]So this is Red Dead Redemption 2, by the way, if you weren't aware.
[05:26.50]This is a new Western game that came out.
[05:32.24]Is this supposed to be somebody talking here?
[05:39.28]Spoilers?
[05:41.62]Well, what are you doing at a Red Dead 2 stream if you're scared about spoilers?
[05:52.87]I lived in Vinny's dryer for a week?
[05:56.43]No.
[05:59.21]That's not out of the ordinary, though.
[06:01.44]I pay rent.
[06:11.50]By 1899, the age of outlaws and gunslingers was at an end.
[06:15.79]I've got to turn this up.
[06:19.73]It's like the volume control on this dumb thing.
[06:22.39]There we go.
[06:27.25]Turn it up.
[06:34.00]He's got to do a cowboy accent.
[06:36.78]Even the wish had mostly been tamed.
[06:40.38]That was until they showed up.
[06:44.30]Bill, Bob, Barry, Borg.
[06:49.96]A few gangs still remain, but they were being hunted down and destroyed.
[06:54.80]I can't read cursive.
[06:57.86]I got taught cursive.
[06:58.74]I don't know how to fucking read it.
[07:01.46]There we go.
[07:02.25]If that wasn't cursive, I would have been upset about that.
[07:03.87]You know what I'm saying?
[07:07.23]Rockstar Games presents...
[07:14.61]Red Dead 2.
[07:15.09]Why does it look like horror movie text?
[07:28.36]Here we go.
[07:29.18]I'm so excited for this.
[07:31.90]Give me my internet.
[07:33.88]I deserve it.
[07:35.04]I deserve an internet.
[07:46.14]Abigail says he's dying, Dutch.
[07:48.44]We'll have to stop someplace.
[07:49.94]That's a lot of bird shit.
[07:50.88]Alright, stop.
[07:51.90]I want to make a joke about a million birds shitting all over them, but I can't.
[07:55.14]Stop it.
[07:57.06]If we don't stop soon, we'll all be dying.
[07:59.50]This weather, it's May.
[08:02.79]I'm just hoping the law got as lost as we did.
[08:06.51]There.
[08:08.87]Arthur.
[08:10.19]Any luck?
[08:11.55]That's me, right?
[08:12.65]I found a place where we can get some shelter.
[08:16.12]Let Davey rest while he... you know.
[08:21.16]An old mining town.
[08:23.16]Abandoned.
[08:23.66]It ain't far.
[08:25.23]Come on.
[08:26.69]Come on!
[08:28.05]Yeah!
[08:31.55]Okay, old mining town.
[08:34.99]10 FPS with gameplay.
[08:36.25]You might be referring to my internet.
[08:48.97]Chapter 1.
[08:49.41]I don't know what that says.
[08:53.74]I'm not going to read the subtitles at the bottom.
[08:56.88]I'm going to try to read it.
[08:58.86]Alright.
[09:07.16]Clash Shlistro.
[09:11.71]This game has like an hour-long tutorial.
[09:13.21]Hey, just long enough for us to make sure the internet will stay on.
[09:16.33]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[09:26.19]Oh, my God.
[09:27.97]Miss Gaskell, get that Firelink, please.
[09:31.43]Miss Jones, bring in whatever blankets we have.
[09:34.47]Mr. Pearson, see what we've got in terms of food.
[09:37.32]Jesus.
[09:40.52]Davey's dead.
[09:42.14]Thank you, Jabba Dab.
[09:44.06]Nothing more you could have done.
[09:46.70]What are we going to do?
[09:47.50]We need supplies.
[09:49.46]Well, first of all, you're going to stay here, and you are going to get yourself worn.
[09:54.13]I sent John and Micah scouting out ahead.
[09:57.59]It's welcome.
[09:58.03]Thank you, man.
[09:58.95]Thank you so much.
[09:59.59]See if we can find one.
[10:01.45]Waiting for some time to deliver these bits to you.
[10:02.97]It's great to see you back in action, especially after you had to once again deal with some internet issues.
[10:07.48]Still are.
[10:09.34]Listen.
[10:10.66]Still are at the moment.
[10:11.50]Listen to me, Ollie, for a moment.
[10:14.56]Now we've had... Is it John?
[10:16.00]A bad couple of days.
[10:21.80]I loved Davey.
[10:25.60]Jenny.
[10:28.00]Sean, Mac, they may be okay.
[10:31.52]We don't know.
[10:34.63]But we lost some folks.
[10:37.29]Now, if I could throw myself in the ground in their stead, I'd do it.
[10:46.76]Gladly.
[10:48.00]Quit Comcast?
[10:48.60]I don't have Comcast.
[10:49.64]I have a different ISP across the country.
[10:53.46]And it still follows me.
[10:55.60]Everybody, we're safe now.
[10:59.70]There ain't nobody following us through a storm like this one.
[11:05.27]And by the time they get here, well, we're going to be long gone.
[11:11.69]We've been through worse than this before.
[11:13.45]John McFarston.
[11:14.79]That was the guy.
[11:15.31]Mr. Pearson.
[11:16.75]Miss Grimshaw, I need you to turn this place into a camp.
[11:21.31]You may be here for a few days.
[11:23.89]Now, all of you, all of you, get yourselves warm.
[11:31.12]Stay strong.
[11:32.82]It might be the modem router.
[11:34.08]Oh, no, no, no.
[11:34.62]Every single option is bing.
[11:36.42]Uh-oh.
[11:37.10]We're okay.
[11:38.60]So, they both must have headed down the hill.

[12:17.45]Alright, I get to play the game, though.
[12:21.52]It's deep snow.
[12:24.42]Is this on PC?
[12:28.08]Is this game not PC at all?
[12:30.48]Is it on PC now?
[12:31.38]Yeah, I didn't think it was.
[12:45.56]There's Jabba Dab's $250 coming in.
[12:50.28]Again, thank you so much, man.
[12:51.48]I know I'm, like, trying to bounce and monitor my connection and play a game.
[12:57.20]Thank you so fucking much, dude.
[12:59.62]That's a huge amount of money.
[13:08.05]Big delayed money.
[13:10.13]Yeah, I don't know why that's happening.
[13:18.00]I don't know what it is with Rockstar and not putting their flagship video games on PC.
[13:23.90]The first Red Dead's not even on.
[13:25.08]Red Dead Redemption's not on.
[13:26.42]PC at all.
[13:26.76]For some strange reason.
[13:35.38]At least we don't need to worry about Pinkertons tailing us in this.
[13:39.63]We're going northeast at the moment.
[13:45.99]Sick.
[13:48.37]Okay.
[13:49.93]I'm sorry.
[13:51.15]All I heard was crouch in the corner and throw rocks at people.
[13:55.87]Is that what you wanted me to do?
[13:57.80]With my, like, Dalmatian horse?
[14:02.18]Oh, that's snow.
[14:02.96]Right.
[14:05.40]I thought it was like a giant dalvation.
[14:14.51]Is that someone coming towards us?
[14:15.97]Someone coming towards us.
[14:16.83]Are they friendly?
[14:18.43]Ooh, cutscene!
[14:23.25]Bring it on!
[14:25.29]You up ahead!
[14:26.57]Who's there?
[14:28.35]Guy on the left's gonna get picked off.
[14:29.94]With an arrow.
[14:32.46]Micah.
[14:35.11]Gentlemen, I don't need anything.

[15:14.49]I'm glad you're alright, Micah.
[15:17.41]Always.
[15:19.03]Ask him if he's seen John.
[15:21.49]Hey, have you seen John, Micah?
[15:24.38]John?
[15:24.74]Are you talking about our John?
[15:26.76]My John?
[15:28.18]First game, John?
[15:29.02]I haven't seen him.
[15:30.58]He'll be fine.
[15:32.55]Double-tap and hold while pushing.
[15:33.61]How is it to hold?
[15:34.97]It just disappeared.
[15:37.13]Talk to Mike.
[15:37.79]Are you sure about this?
[15:59.79]let's do that dialog Mr. Morgan I never thought I would be so pleased to see
[16:07.65]Things always turn out fine, except for in Red Dead Redemption.
[16:11.43]Gotta love these graphics though.
[16:14.67]The snow actually permeates.
[16:32.82]People tell me to keep looking at the balls.
[16:34.70]No.
[16:35.38]I wouldn't do that in real life.
[16:37.24]Why would I do that in a video game?
[16:41.74]If I was in this time period, I wouldn't go underneath the carriage like it was an oil change.
[16:48.06]And lift up the tail and look at the ball sack.
[16:49.72]What are you talking about?
[16:52.30]Do you look under your car and look for your car's balls?
[16:57.26]What would be the car balls?
[16:59.10]I'm trying to think what it would be.
[17:03.41]the cars the car balls would be like the muffler right okay let's keep it down now gentlemen it's just up ahead okay let's head down there
[17:35.95]Health is displayed in the lower left corner.
[17:37.95]That tiny little thing is health?
[17:43.12]That's so small!
[17:44.16]How am I supposed to see that?
[17:46.58]Wait, is this like Super Mario, where there's like three quadrants?
[17:56.20]The outer bar shows... Alright, but that was about an outer bar and an inner bar.
[18:04.68]Approach the hitching post.
[18:05.63]Let's get it on here.
[18:09.51]Triangle hitches the horse.
[18:13.25]And we got our first set of action here, I think.
[18:14.89]Follow Dutch.
[18:15.25]I remember Dutch.
[18:15.63]This is a lot of snow.
[18:28.68]Motherfucker.
[18:29.32]Why does this have to follow me everywhere I go?
[18:31.90]I don't understand.
[18:32.54]Go to the shed and press R1 to take cover.
[18:35.63]There's a shed over here.
[19:02.86]The latter took three weeks blame blame Cox communications Because these motherfuckers can't figure it out either and it's their service This is the shed, right?
[19:21.66]Oh the cattle shed Like in this thing
[19:30.02]This is not the cattle shed.
[19:36.29]Get up there.
[19:37.07]Did I just take my glasses off?
[19:41.39]How do I get out of here?
[19:42.19]I'm sorry, I haven't been paying attention.
[19:48.59]What cattle shed is he referring to?
[19:50.23]In here?
[19:50.61]Is this not the shed?
[20:08.10]Stuck because no flip?
[20:09.06]No, stuck because I have to look over here and watch 5% of every frame drop.
[20:14.10]Because it's taken this company three weeks to try to fix a problem.
[20:18.93]Oh my fucking god, it's infuriating.
[20:25.79]Go back.
[20:30.29]Go to the shed.
[20:32.42]Is it the shed that's like straight in front of me here?
[20:36.64]That looked like a cattle shit to me.
[20:42.32]The huge yellow thing.
[20:43.38]That's... Isn't that where I just was?
[20:47.36]Like, isn't this... This is where I was.
[20:49.02]Isn't this where I was?
[20:49.94]Highlighted in yellow.
[20:52.62]This thing here.
[20:53.22]Isn't this where I just was?
[20:55.98]I just did this.
[20:58.29]Didn't I just do this?
[20:59.07]Hello?
[21:01.97]Shut up, Billy.
[21:03.41]Excuse me!
[21:06.32]I didn't hide what you want I am very sorry to disturb you uh my friends and I well we got into some trouble up the way lost in the storm
[21:22.80]There goes Michael.
[21:23.90]What's he gonna do?
[21:24.64]Protect Dutch.
[21:26.14]Okay.
[21:26.28]Is this guy gonna fire at him?
[21:53.66]Now, friend, I ain't asking for much.
[22:00.04]Please.
[22:09.30]I just like, holy shit.
[22:10.80]This is aiming is a little weird.
[22:13.46]What is with the aiming?
[22:21.96]It's like, why is it pulling me?
[22:27.44]I gotta change the sensitivity here.
[22:32.28]Is he still alive?
[22:42.22]Great soundtrack, yeah.
[22:46.49]Alright, where is it?
[22:48.07]This way?
[22:53.24]He's not gonna last by himself out there Now he won't last at all Didn't handle it I had to do something about it Let's go search the cabin
[23:26.45]Fucking internet companies, man.
[23:27.79]Hold, squaring your items to pick them up while searching the house.
[23:31.55]Okay.
[23:31.67]They're gonna open pots and shit?
[23:32.53]There's cabinets.
[23:51.57]Hold near items to pick them up while searching.
[23:56.95]Canned sweet corn.
[23:59.03]Assorted biscuits.
[24:03.43]Fruits.
[24:05.33]Whiskey is not essential?
[24:06.44]Are you serious?
[24:09.94]Your health core drains over time and is now empty.
[24:11.76]While empty, you will experience negative effects.
[24:13.60]Do you have to eat in this game?
[24:21.22]Okay.
[24:22.80]Slowly restores health core and moderately restores stamina core.
[24:27.94]Interesting.
[24:30.46]And then we have to go bake beans so that, okay, the middle is your core.
[24:36.10]Slightly reduce, uh, restores health core.
[24:37.96]Alright.
[24:41.88]Let's just do this in the middle one first.
[24:43.46]Let's just try it out.
[24:47.45]Survival mode?
[24:48.25]It seems like it.
[24:51.48]Better quality food will refill more core.
[24:52.76]Okay.
[24:53.32]Okay.
[24:53.68]I gotta, like, refill my four cores.
[24:55.68]Let's look around for some more stuff.
[25:21.55]Just controls how fast you refill your health and stamina.
[25:26.29]That's better than nothing.
[25:28.87]There's a lot of random shit on the mantle.
[25:34.33]Examine the photographs.
[25:35.29]Sure.
[25:36.27]Let's get some lore.
[25:37.80]Okay, flip it around.
[25:43.34]Secret code in the back.
[25:46.44]Quake and Idy wedding.
[25:55.31]I can't read it.
[26:00.59]Oh, there we go.
[26:01.62]Okay.
[26:05.92]I'm just kidding.
[26:11.48]Oh, look.
[26:11.66]It's from the first game.
[26:12.82]That's the cottage from the first game.
[26:14.18]Alright, what else we got?
[26:23.74]$2.43.
[26:23.76]Have we dropped a frame in the last, like, 15 minutes?
[26:28.42]Can anybody tell?
[26:28.98]Or do I have to, like... Or do I have to, like, scream as loud as I can?
[26:40.11]I have... God damn it.
[26:41.47]Well, I say it now, and now I just did right here.
[26:43.07]I think that's all I can get.
[26:53.48]Arthur, keep looking for stuff.
[26:56.94]Arthur, go see if there's anything in that barn.
[26:59.88]Okay.
[27:00.40]Micah, you search the cabin.
[27:02.34]See what we missed.
[27:04.03]Sure.
[27:06.01]Alright, let's go.
[27:07.87]Investigate the barn.
[27:08.81]I'm gonna go take a look in there.
[27:09.89]I'm gonna go examine it.
[27:13.89]No drop frames since the fight?
[27:15.41]Now you can look at the current objective.
[27:17.55]What's that?
[27:18.41]Is that a bad guy, good guy thing there?
[27:27.38]The atmosphere is great, yeah.
[27:28.78]So far it looks awesome.
[27:31.76]That guy just top roped me.
[27:35.74]Hey, what's happening in here?
[27:37.04]That guy didn't get one hit on him.
[27:41.22]Should you kill him?
[27:56.95]Not yet.
[27:58.71]Interrogate.
[27:59.13]Find out what they're doing here.
[28:00.57]Alright, beat him.
[28:03.51]Oh, this son of a bitch will talk.
[28:05.47]This is just like the Punisher game.
[28:09.81]Where is he?
[28:11.14]Where is he?
[28:12.00]At an old mining camp southwest of here.
[28:16.80]Near the lake.
[28:20.10]Okay.
[28:21.70]Anything else?
[28:23.68]Why are you up here?
[28:26.06]Thanks for the info, buddy.
[28:28.02]Anything else?
[28:29.36]When was the last time you shit your pants?
[28:31.48]Gentlemen!
[28:31.88]When did it happen?
[28:32.82]When?
[28:33.70]When was the last time you shit your pants?
[28:55.09]They don't tell me nothing, I swear.
[28:57.86]Let him go.
[29:00.12]Get the hell out of here.
[29:01.88]Go.
[29:05.00]I'm trying to grab him again.
[29:08.80]Come here.
[29:09.14]I'm not done with you.
[29:15.05]Are there animals over here?
[29:17.07]What the fuck?
[29:19.49]What's happening?
[29:25.20]I have to restart the whole thing?
[29:28.21]Oh, shit.
[29:33.13]Wasted.
[29:34.63]By walking out of the frame.
[29:36.46]Oh, goddammit.
[29:43.60]Well, alright.
[29:44.20]Tell us.
[29:45.85]Tell us again.
[29:46.95]I can't keep up.
[29:49.35]His clothes changed?
[29:50.33]Why are you up here?
[30:05.60]We're fixing to rob some train.
[30:08.36]Gonna blow the tracks.
[30:10.18]I don't know more than that, I swear.
[30:12.72]This is worse mission boundaries than in GTA 5.
[30:15.62]Well, I would say it looks like you have this, Arthur.
[30:18.56]Do what you want with him.
[30:19.58]Alright, so now we get a second chance.
[30:21.14]Should I spare him?
[30:22.24]Remember saving Private Ryan?
[30:23.56]This motherfucker's gonna come back.
[30:27.85]I don't want to do that.
[30:29.03]But what if he comes back?
[30:35.48]Where's my gun?
[30:40.38]Focus on the horse.
[30:52.11]Where are you?
[30:55.37]In the barn?
[30:55.85]How'd you get in here?
[30:59.55]How did you get in here?
[31:01.11]Oh, I can calm the horse.
[31:02.69]This is not my horse.
[31:08.21]What, is this going to freak out and start hitting me?
[31:10.13]Why does this look animatronic?
[31:17.84]I don't know if I trust it, it's animatronic.
[31:27.05]Don't ever stand behind a horse, that's what I was told.
[31:38.40]Check his balls.
[31:39.22]No.
[31:39.46]Alright, let's lead the horse.
[31:42.92]Continuing to bond with your horse increases its trust in you and improves its attributes.
[31:54.42]Horse has now become your horse, as indicated by a blip on the radar.
[31:58.85]Okay.
[32:03.59]We still fucking dropped... Yeah.
[32:10.56]God damn it.
[32:13.86]This is like, I'm like really containing myself right now.
[32:18.27]I'm like, I am like a, I'm holding back.
[32:22.63]But this has been like an infuriating process.
[32:29.85]Hmm.
[32:34.07]Literally moved across the country to a different fucking state.
[32:43.48]Got a faster line.
[32:46.82]And it's worse than it was before.
[32:50.48]That's unbelievable.
[32:52.92]With a different company.
[33:01.95]A gigabit connection.
[33:04.29]Thousand fucking megabits a second.
[33:12.92]Eventually it's gonna get fixed, but who fucking knows when.
[33:21.15]Maybe you're the problem.
[33:22.71]I don't think so.
[33:26.25]I haven't had enough time to be the problem.
[33:29.21]Turned on the modem, got an IP.
[33:31.33]That's it.
[33:44.69]Oh, what the fuck?
[33:46.47]Get off me.
[33:46.99]Hold on.
[33:49.03]Come in here, boy.
[33:49.67]Let's go.
[33:51.39]I got you now.
[33:54.44]Don't you bite me.
[33:56.52]Oh, look what I found in the cellar.
[33:58.38]Wild thing ate ya.
[34:00.36]Leave her alone.
[34:03.14]I wasn't doing nothing.
[34:04.80]She's one of them odriscos.
[34:06.32]No, she ain't, Micah.
[34:07.50]Look at her.
[34:08.52]Just keep going west until you get there.
[34:11.66]Fuck you, fool.
[34:12.72]Micah, look at you.
[34:15.54]Fire.
[34:36.23]You okay, miss?
[34:37.13]They came three days ago.
[34:39.57]And my husband, they... My internet's acting up because I clicked on your screen.
[34:45.25]Miss, you are safe now.
[34:48.49]And you can't stay here.
[34:50.15]I mean, that fire wasn't bad.
[34:51.19]You could just jump on that thing and roll around.
[34:53.29]And it would have gone out.
[34:54.00]You come with us?
[34:55.32]Yes.
[34:58.54]It's okay.
[35:00.40]We're bad men.
[35:02.48]We ain't them.
[35:05.38]It's okay.
[35:08.10]Get on.
[35:09.44]We'll keep you safe until you figure out what you want to do.
[35:13.93]What's your name, miss?
[35:16.63]Miss.
[35:18.39]Adler.
[35:19.61]Adler?
[35:20.93]What is notorious for burning easy during a blizzard?
[35:23.15]Mrs. I... He... He was my husband.
[35:51.47]Hey, somebody's coming.
[35:55.31]Looks like it's Dutch.
[35:57.19]Hey, everybody, Dutch is back.
[35:58.75]We're good.
[35:59.47]How'd you get on?
[36:01.81]Micah found a homestead, but he weren't the first.
[36:06.23]Colm O'Driscoll and his scum, they beat us to it.
[36:10.72]We found some of them there, but there is more about.
[36:15.38]Apparently...
[36:17.85]Scouting a train.
[36:19.55]Thank you.
[36:20.70]This is not on PC, unfortunately.
[36:22.84]Well, it is what it is.
[36:24.44]But we found some supplies, some blankets, a little bit of food, and this poor soul, Mrs. Adler.
[36:32.24]Miss Tilly, Miss Karen, would you warm her up?
[36:34.79]Give her a drink or something?
[36:37.31]And Mrs. Adler, it's gonna be okay.
[36:40.37]You're safe now.
[36:42.50]They turned her into a widow.
[36:44.40]Animals.
[36:45.32]I need some rest.
[36:46.33]I haven't slept in three days.
[36:50.87]You're over here.
[36:52.15]Miss O'Shea will show you the way.
[36:54.13]Mr. Morgan, we put you in a room over here.
[36:57.39]Thank you, Miss Grimshaw.
[36:58.95]Mr. Bell, you're with the fellas over there.
[37:01.79]What?
[37:02.53]How come Arthur gets a room and I get a bunk bed next to Bill Williamson and a bunch of darkies?
[37:08.01]Get yourself to bed.
[37:16.83]Rockstar are a bunch of idiots for not putting it on PC.
[37:19.63]Yeah, I don't know.
[37:22.35]There's got to be some reason why.
[37:23.87]There's not, but I really wonder.
[37:30.25]He ain't been seen in days.
[37:32.25]The weather ain't let up.
[37:34.35]He's strong.
[37:35.75]And he's smart.
[37:36.79]Strong, at least.
[37:37.61]Hello, Arthur.
[37:40.44]Abigail.
[37:42.04]Arthur, how you doing?
[37:45.36]Hours.
[37:45.62]Hmm.
[38:04.96]He may be as dumb as rocks and as dull as rusted iron, but that ain't changing because he got caught in some snowstorm.
[38:11.99]At least go take a look.
[38:13.77]Javier?
[38:14.39]Yes?
[38:15.37]Javier, will you ride out with Arthur to take a look for John?
[38:20.27]You're the two best fit men we've got.
[38:22.73]Now?
[38:23.01]She's... We're all... Yeah, we're pretty worried about him.
[38:29.18]I know.
[38:30.97]the situation were reversed.
[38:32.59]They'd look for me.
[38:38.89]Thank you.
[38:41.46]British accent?
[38:43.44]This way.
[38:45.10]Last I know, John was headed up the river.
[38:48.56]For all we know,
[38:50.48]He kept riding north and never looked back.
[38:53.56]He wouldn't leave.
[38:54.20]Not like that.
[38:55.66]That emote is making my chat scroll horizontally.
[39:00.38]Wait, what?
[39:01.90]Wait, what?
[39:02.40]Wait, hold on.
[39:03.12]What are you talking about?
[39:11.37]It's time to find John Mark.
[39:12.87]I need to get happy.
[39:14.31]I'm sad right now because of this internet bullshit.
[39:17.67]I gotta get, like, excited.
[39:19.05]This is Red Dead Redemption 2.
[39:20.17]This is not, like... This is not an iPad game.
[39:23.45]Alright, let's do some investigating reporting here.
[39:45.69]Did he do it?
[39:46.13]Did he do it?
[39:46.56]Did he do it?
[39:47.02]Did he do it?
[39:47.42]Are we not going to like it anyways?
[39:50.02]What?
[39:52.02]I loved the first one.
[39:55.10]The first one was great.
[39:56.32]Let's inspect the camp.
[39:58.48]There could be dust.
[40:01.25]There could be fingerprints.
[40:02.35]There's finger dust on here.
[40:03.41]Fine.
[40:06.53]Alright, fine, fine, fine.
[40:12.64]I don't want to do fucking dust for fingerprints and you didn't want to do shit.
[40:18.46]Watch out, watch out, hot, hot, hot, hot, burning, burning, burn!
[40:21.12]Burnt my horse's legs.
[40:22.54]Stamina drains when your horse gallops or jumps.
[40:24.70]I can't see anything.
[40:40.31]Somebody turn the antennas around.
[40:48.98]That lake was steaming.
[40:53.22]Well, this is a beautiful mountain though.
[40:55.78]To change camera distance and perspective, press...
[41:06.57]He wouldn't even let me do the YouTuber joke.
[41:09.42]Come on.
[41:09.80]Why?
[41:10.22]Come on.
[41:12.74]Oh, sorry.
[41:13.42]I got off track.
[41:16.00]There's a long cliff wall here.
[41:19.72]Let me just look.
[41:21.26]Whoa!
[41:22.61]You can't... Hold on.
[41:32.43]Wait, you can't... Ugh.
[41:41.12]The horse wouldn't do it.
[41:42.46]But you get up and you can do it.
[41:47.22]See, they continue up that way.
[41:48.80]That fall was so stupid, too.
[41:51.16]It was like he lost control of all of his bodily function.
[41:54.75]You tell me.
[41:55.91]And that, like, aah!
[41:58.23]It was like Emperor Palpatine getting thrown into the thing in the end of the fourth movie.
[42:04.29]He just did the Emperor Palpatine scream.
[42:06.64]What really happened on that boat?
[42:09.08]We had the money.
[42:09.88]It seemed fine.
[42:11.75]Alright, so I got the stamina bar.
[42:13.79]The horse bar has the horseshoe.
[42:29.63]Okay, so that's distance.
[42:30.61]That's what I want.
[42:31.13]FPS mode?
[42:31.59]Okay, not gonna do it.
[43:00.02]It's not funny.
[43:01.66]I'm sorry.
[43:06.51]It's not funny.
[43:07.69]Wait, that was a bear?
[43:08.99]What are you talking about a bear?
[43:12.73]That was... I was trying to turn around because I was making the fake...
[43:16.95]It's not funny.
[43:18.39]It is funny.
[43:19.55]It is funny.
[43:20.64]Whatever.
[43:23.36]It was a bear?
[43:24.08]I don't think it was a bear.
[43:25.80]Was it a bear?
[43:26.60]It's not funny.
[43:27.46]Please stop.
[43:28.72]I'm sorry.
[43:28.94]Get me.
[43:29.10]I'm not going over there.
[43:47.44]Dutch killed a girl on the road.
[43:50.58]Bad way.
[43:52.31]But it was a bad situation.
[43:53.69]I ain't like him, bro.
[44:00.64]Tracks go left, down here.
[44:07.41]I'm not doing it one more time.
[44:08.87]Bad business, alright.
[44:26.37]Activate cinematic camera, hold this button down.
[44:31.63]That's cool.
[44:32.72]It automatically follows roads.
[44:35.14]Oh, let's see.
[44:36.20]It's like watching an actual movie.
[44:39.06]Nice.
[44:42.12]Change cinematic camera, press R3.
[44:46.18]Alright, there's a lot of use cases for this, I think.
[44:54.03]Am I still controlling the character?
[45:03.70]shit yeah I am it's hard to do I'm gonna play the whole game like this I'm gonna be the first streamer on Twitch first guy on Twitch to do it only in cinematic mode
[45:24.77]This looks like, you know when you were 14 and you made that machinima?
[45:32.22]That's what I'm doing right now.
[45:33.58]I'm not gonna turn it off.
[45:34.38]Why would I turn this off?
[46:02.73]Oh wow, let's investigate.
[46:04.41]He was riding this horse?
[46:09.72]Help!
[46:13.56]Where?
[46:15.10]Up here!
[46:18.94]I heard it from this way!
[46:27.25]Is this the right way?
[46:28.03]Am I going the wrong way?
[46:40.96]I gotta get it out of my system now.
[46:43.06]Oh shit.
[46:43.92]Okay, don't Okay, no no no no just relax I'm not gonna fucking do it again.
[46:54.47]I'm sorry These are horse tracks for sure but could be anyone I have like these
[47:05.69]So, you were there, Javier.
[47:09.93]What really happened on that boat?
[47:12.37]We had the money.
[47:13.16]It seemed fine.
[47:15.06]Then suddenly, they were everywhere.
[47:16.90]Bounty hunters?
[47:18.46]No, Pinkerton.
[47:20.18]It was crazy.
[47:21.44]Raining bullets.
[47:22.06]Watch out for this crevice.
[47:22.84]You just killed a girl, I know.
[47:35.52]Okay, here we go.
[47:45.03]No, I'm not gonna jump.
[47:45.85]I'm not falling off another edge.
[47:47.65]That is a 100% guarantee.
[47:48.57]Like, I can 100% guarantee.
[47:49.23]If I fall off the edge in the next, like, minute or two in this, like, little tutorial, I will do 100 push-ups in a row on camera.
[48:07.07]Alright, here we go.
[48:12.64]We're good.
[48:13.30]Take the Jerm attacks 30%.
[48:14.20]It adds the bars too, that's important.
[48:37.23]I'm not gonna fall.
[48:37.99]I'm doing the thing that's impossible to... You cannot fall like this.
[48:45.71]It's not possible.
[48:49.54]I'm holding X. Watch yourself.
[48:53.22]It's not very wide here.
[48:59.10]I'm tensed up right now like you wouldn't believe.
[49:02.09]Come on, boy.
[49:04.07]Of course you're struggling.
[49:06.85]I like this one.
[49:08.43]How am I gonna aim and shoot at people with a cinematic camera?
[49:12.86]Is that possible?
[49:13.98]So close to the edge, yeah?
[49:14.82]She has to guess.
[49:15.40]I can't just guess.
[49:37.66]This is beautiful though.
[49:39.78]Alright.
[49:40.26]Let's get a different angle here.
[49:44.36]So John is here somewhere.
[49:47.65]Alright, I gotta follow him.
[49:57.49]Up there.
[49:58.33]Don't say up there.
[49:59.09]I'm gonna follow you.
[50:01.95]Don't push me off.
[50:08.73]Alright.
[50:09.51]Here we go.
[50:12.81]Do I go over this?
[50:13.63]Alright, we're good.
[50:14.19]It's a walk from here.
[50:14.89]Oh, no.
[50:16.33]Oh, no.
[50:16.49]Grab shotgun.
[50:16.87]Horse weapons.
[50:37.63]Okay, so R1, okay, I can only hold one sidearm, so I'm gonna get the shotgun.
[50:46.75]So, did I lose cinematic?
[50:48.81]There we go, it's back.
[50:49.55]Wait, hold on.
[50:51.11]Okay.
[50:56.75]Oh, it turns off right when you hold the button down.
[51:01.81]You can't do it.
[51:03.21]Wait, is this an edge?
[51:07.84]Okay, we're good.
[51:16.34]It's on, it's on.
[51:18.27]I'm not cheating.
[51:28.03]I want to see from another angle.
[51:29.79]I don't want to see... Holy fuck, I just... That didn't count.
[51:32.71]I fell off a ledge onto another ledge.
[51:34.21]I didn't die.
[51:42.57]Stamina's displayed in the lower left corner.
[51:44.05]I don't have it.
[51:46.01]Watch yourself.
[51:46.93]Okay.
[51:47.47]This doesn't count either because this is... Okay.
[51:56.83]Oh, god damn it.
[52:02.47]Yeah, I'm alright.
[52:13.61]This is the most stressful thing I've done in a long time.
[52:19.48]Am I running the lip?
[52:25.44]My stamina core is empty.
[52:35.28]Square and this is climb.
[52:37.73]I need access to the shaft.
[52:38.71]I need to eat something, man.
[52:42.19]I need some stamina here.
[52:45.13]Classic oatcakes.
[52:50.95]Is there just a stamina one?
[52:55.26]Just canned peaches is fine.
[52:59.42]I thought I just fucking fell.
[53:14.97]That looks odd from cinematic view.
[53:19.29]Alright, we're doing fine.
[53:22.33]Just eating peaches?
[53:30.27]Canned peaches are where it's at, man.
[53:31.71]That's good shit.
[53:34.05]John?
[53:45.82]John.
[53:47.14]John, we'll be looking for you.
[53:48.08]Marston, you hear me?
[53:50.32]John, the street lights are on.
[53:52.04]You're in deep shit when you get home.
[53:53.58]That's John.
[53:55.03]We're coming.
[53:55.93]Where is he?
[54:02.31]He's down here.
[54:05.45]He's in the game.
[54:06.07]He's in the game.
[54:06.95]Where is he?
[54:12.77]That's quite a scratch you got there.
[54:16.37]Never thought I'd say this, but good to see you, Arthur Morgan.
[54:21.41]So he is in the game, wow.
[54:26.19]You don't look so good.
[54:27.81]I don't feel too good neither.
[54:29.23]I could probably do that if I tried hard enough.
[54:33.06]I'm freezing.
[54:38.12]Don't die just yet, cowboy.
[54:42.65]Come on, compadre.
[54:44.57]Alright, now we've got to cinematically walk him back to his car.
[54:48.26]Oh, we actually do.
[54:51.22]Well, we can't go back the way we came.
[54:53.30]Let's try this way.
[54:56.04]Ain't you a sorry sight.
[54:58.78]I can't argue with you there.
[55:02.10]See?
[55:03.32]I told Dutch you weren't the right man for this.
[55:05.58]I think this is just supposed to happen, right?
[55:07.04]Sure you did.
[55:07.78]You alright?
[55:12.09]If we go on the right, is this supposed to be?
[55:15.63]Okay.
[55:15.73]Uh-oh.
[55:16.17]Wildlife.
[55:16.49]We're being hunted by wolves.
[55:32.76]I'll distract him while you get to the horses.
[55:35.74]Who's gonna distract him?
[55:37.11]Alright, you gotta get to the horses.
[55:39.45]Keep the wolves away from both of them.
[55:40.89]Let's get you on that horse.
[55:41.93]That's just not gonna work.
[55:55.07]No, it takes it off cinematic mode.
[55:56.81]Oh well, we tried.
[55:58.81]Okay, let's get going before any more of these bastards show up.
[56:24.11]Get him on the horse.
[56:24.69]You can see he's gonna drive him.
[56:25.47]Okay.
[56:30.89]Do first person mode?
[56:32.33]That's actually a good idea too.
[56:43.26]Okay.
[56:44.32]Where is he?
[56:47.60]Oh shit, there we go.
[56:49.36]Alright, yee-haw!
[56:50.74]We're gonna get a yee-haw?
[56:53.37]Please don't commit to this.
[56:55.99]I'm not committing to it.
[56:59.81]This is not very cinematic.
[57:00.83]All of them!
[57:33.10]War coming in on the left.
[57:34.40]Get the hell out of here!
[57:38.95]That was pretty stupid.
[57:42.21]That rag doll.
[57:43.53]Don't think so.
[57:45.95]Jesus.
[57:46.69]He just buried his face in the ground and just slid.
[57:50.55]You're gonna be okay.
[57:51.84]We have some shelter now.
[57:53.72]Thanks for coming for me.
[57:55.52]Just the portal soundtrack?
[57:58.18]Now this.
[57:59.30]You got a hell of a time.
[58:00.68]And Arthur always says...
[58:03.10]I'm lucky none of us are lucky right now it's really crazy that John Marston's in this game and he just becomes Darth Vader in the next one you get to see his origin story here that's right in the water for a bit try to lose a scent don't want to leave a trail right back to camp you know
[58:20.22]We're gonna need to come up with a better story for that scar.
[58:24.42]So, freezing, bleeding, starving, damn near getting eaten to death ain't good enough for you.
[58:32.43]Here, let's cross to the left.
[58:34.81]Oops.
[58:35.39]Yeah, come on.
[58:38.15]Let's push hard and get back.
[58:40.75]We're good.
[58:41.57]I did it.
[58:42.21]I made it.
[58:44.65]That's where we camped.
[58:46.35]Nearly there.
[58:53.09]Super boys Can I scream too does it help We need some help come on help him down Oh

[59:16.21]Here we go.
[59:17.17]There we go.

[59:19.60]I didn't even say one, two, three.
[59:21.86]Come on, let's get you warm.
[59:23.78]Thank you.
[59:24.40]Thank you both.
[59:26.20]This is a new low, even by your standards.
[59:29.67]Thank you, Arthur.
[59:31.05]Thank you.
[59:31.35]Not today.
[59:36.53]Have you and Dutch talked about how we're going to get out of this?
[59:39.72]I was just discussing with Herr Strauss.
[59:42.24]When the weather breaks, I suppose we'll have to keep heading east.
[59:45.24]East?
[59:45.94]Into all that civilization?
[59:48.78]I know.
[59:49.94]The west is where our problems are worse.
[59:52.22]The west.
[59:53.16]Come on, Herr Strauss.
[59:54.28]Let's get warm.
[59:55.58]Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[59:59.31]You never seen this game before?
[60:00.19]Is it on the SEGA Genesis?
[60:02.31]Hello, hello.
[60:03.49]Fucking hello, hello.
[60:09.14]I was just gonna scream yes, but I'm not a screamer.
[60:14.05]Events and interesting locations are noted in your journal as you explore.
[60:18.07]Hold W to view.
[60:18.89]Hold X for details.
[60:38.06]Log.
[60:39.04]Enter.
[60:39.30]Pursued by memory.
[60:40.00]John hasn't returned from an earlier scouting trip.
[60:42.60]Arthur and Javier ride out into the snow to look for him.
[60:46.91]Okay.
[60:48.61]Checklist.
[60:49.01]Kill all the wolves without taking any damage.
[60:50.53]Complete with at least 80.
[60:51.39]Didn't do either of those.
[60:54.41]That's alright.
[60:54.93]Let's take a look at this.
[60:56.23]Here's the journal.
[60:58.01]That's a very bad drawing.
[61:03.87]You know when, like, somebody asks you for directions, and you draw them a terrible map of intersections?
[61:08.65]That's what it just looks like.
[61:10.57]Uh, okay.
[61:10.99]So, uh... Can I just draw in here, too?
[61:12.41]What is this book?
[61:13.17]Okay.
[61:29.28]Why would I not use this piece of paper on the left?
[61:32.16]It's a waste of trees.
[61:35.28]Is that the White House?
[61:36.87]Oh, okay.
[61:43.47]Blacksmithing?
[61:47.31]I can't read this.
[61:52.31]Oh, thank God it can be translated.
[61:53.72]That's kind of cool.
[62:04.03]Continue playing to unlock your bonus content.
[62:06.93]Oh, I'm one of the suckers that spent $80 to get the one mission that nobody else gets.
[62:13.99]I feel real great about that purchase, by the way.
[62:15.73]Alright, let's just go.
[62:26.75]Let's just do some shit.
[62:31.69]We got our mini-map here.
[62:37.79]Got a horse, yeah.
[62:42.72]Hold L2 to talk.
[62:48.70]Eh!
[62:48.98]33-year-old substitute teacher can't read cursive.
[62:58.00]Alright, let's go!
[63:08.67]I haven't been a substitute teacher in a long time.
[63:10.47]Alright.
[63:13.57]Alright, let's talk.
[63:14.19]L2.
[63:14.63]Great.
[63:15.89]Another cold morning.
[63:17.84]Another cold morning.
[63:29.04]What?
[63:30.22]What is it doing?
[63:30.85]Wait, why?
[63:35.33]Why did it make me get off for it to go to the bathroom?
[63:37.45]Get over here!
[63:38.87]What are you doing?
[63:39.81]Hey!
[63:41.41]Hey, come here!
[63:42.57]Come back here!
[63:43.85]What are you- what are you going?
[63:49.91]Alright.
[63:50.81]Relax.
[63:55.43]Shit and run.
[64:00.71]I guess we- should we do B or P?
[64:03.49]Let's just do- it's right here, let's just do B.
[64:12.55]up with you boys because I thought you liked action a couple of days on the lamb you lot have all turned yellow apart from you of course shut up micah I ain't never seen so many long faces I guess I guess folks miss them that fell but when I fall I don't want no fuss when you fall there'll be a party
[64:36.19]Probably.
[64:37.75]Probably.
[64:39.23]Funny, huh?
[64:40.81]Sure.
[64:44.72]I don't feel like being laughed at by the likes of you two.
[64:48.20]Stop it.
[64:49.42]Now.
[64:50.52]You fools punching each other when Como Driscoll's needing punching.
[64:54.87]Hard.
[64:55.63]You want to sit around waiting for him to come find us?
[64:58.59]All of you, we got work to do.
[65:00.53]Alright, time for the team mission.
[65:01.85]Alright.
[65:20.79]You always said revenge is a luxury we can't afford.
[65:24.75]This is the right call, Arthur.
[65:26.93]Take this.
[65:27.91]Why does he just sound like a pitch-shifted version of him?
[65:33.04]They were talking about trains and detonators here.
[65:38.58]Cone always had good information.
[65:42.37]Come on.
[65:43.41]And you think now is the right time to hit a train?
[65:47.02]Now you, my fancy living on deer piss and rabbit shit, I'm getting too old for that life.
[65:54.17]Mr. Matthews, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pearson, would you please look after the place there are O'Driscolls about?
[66:02.11]Voice crack, voice crack.
[66:04.00]Everyone laugh at him, right?
[66:05.00]You laugh at me.
[66:08.36]And that guy's way stronger than all of you.
[66:12.38]Alright, point it out.
[66:15.80]Everybody point it out in the chat, right?
[66:18.14]Alright, so we're gonna go... This is a robbery.
[66:25.96]Cinematic mode, automatic.
[66:27.00]I didn't even... Automatic cinematic.
[66:28.56]I didn't even do it.
[66:31.78]Somebody turn on the AC.
[66:32.97]It's getting hot in here.
[66:33.97]Automatic cinematic.
[66:37.75]I'll scold myself for that one later in the shower, I promise.
[66:47.10]I'm sorry.
[66:47.60]I've been away for like three weeks.
[66:52.96]I'm gonna be in the shower being like, with my hand up, wicked hot water just going like, fucking stupid.
[66:59.26]Don't ever say something like that again.
[67:00.80]As far as I can tell, the only fools out here are us and them.
[67:05.77]They must be this way.
[67:09.88]You good, Dutch?
[67:11.70]Of course.
[67:12.79]Listen, I know you don't think much of my ideas recently, but this is the right move.
[67:18.97]Okay.
[67:19.49]Debatable.
[67:21.05]You know I've got your back.
[67:21.93]Scream the shower.
[67:23.83]I learned a long time ago that you hit, Como Driscoll.
[67:27.35]No drop frames, by the way.
[67:28.43]I get to get out of meltdown mode.
[67:30.07]I'm in the fun, fun mode.
[67:31.75]This feud between you and him needs to be put to rest one way or another.
[67:40.34]Just give it ten minutes for me to go off on another like audibly upset r- you know like the difference?
[67:57.54]When somebody's like, oh, I'm pissed off.
[67:59.18]What the heck, man?
[68:00.22]Whoa, I can't believe I died there.
[68:02.38]What's happening here?
[68:03.22]Oh, damn it.
[68:04.76]First when you start talking like this.
[68:05.98]Like this fucking stupid fucking thing.
[68:08.48]That's how you know somebody's really angry.
[68:11.91]Internally, they're so hot and they're nervous and shit.
[68:13.67]And they start fucking getting angry like that.
[68:15.81]It's not like, what the fuck?
[68:16.81]Whoa, I died in the game.
[68:18.27]Oh, I'm so mad.
[68:19.31]Whoa.
[68:27.96]Whoa!
[68:33.03]Are we birds?
[68:33.95]Alright, gentlemen.
[68:35.81]This is it.
[68:39.05]Are we goddamn ready?
[68:41.81]Ready, Dutch.
[68:42.84]Good.
[68:43.70]That was very, very good.
[68:44.58]That was like a classroom attendance.
[68:45.78]Mr. Morgan and I, we're going to head up here a little, see if we can't get a sense of the layout of the camp.
[68:52.24]Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bell, you two take up a hidden position just outside the camp.
[68:58.07]Mr. Summers, Mr. Escuela, you two hold position here.
[69:04.91]Let's go.
[69:09.85]Alright.
[69:14.29]Alright, throw haymaker.
[69:16.93]I'm depleting.
[69:22.21]This is absolutely beautiful.
[69:24.07]This is beautiful.
[69:27.00]It's just beautiful out here.
[69:33.83]That was at the same time.
[69:37.55]Holy shit, this is what it looks like to look through his eyes.
[69:42.75]You gotta go to a doctor, man.
[69:44.68]You need a prescription.
[69:50.20]You got astigmatism, bro.
[69:51.54]Alright, headshot from all the way back here.
[70:07.34]What was wrong with that one?
[70:10.10]Who's he talking to?
[70:12.06]He don't seem very happy.
[70:15.41]No.
[70:20.55]They leaving?
[70:21.53]Seem to be.
[70:22.39]Should we go get them?
[70:23.53]No.
[70:24.99]Cone can wait.
[70:26.84]Best to get some of them out of there.
[70:29.40]Alright, so we're gonna sneak up Metal Gear Solid 3 Necksnap.
[70:34.09]Two of them.
[70:37.89]Oh, I was hoping I could see his big eyes.
[70:40.93]Like Macaulay Culkin style.
[70:43.03]Mm-hmm.
[70:54.61]Weapons not set on your loadout before dismounting will remain on your horse.
[70:59.26]Alright, so we got... New... Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[71:06.86]Approach your horse and debuse door.
[71:10.27]Hold L1.
[71:11.27]Do it.
[71:12.79]Okay, so... Where's the rifle?
[71:17.49]Right here.
[71:18.67]Long arm back carbine.
[71:20.55]Or... Carbine repeater.
[71:24.96]Oh, that's just the slot it's in.
[71:26.20]Okay.
[71:26.86]I get it.
[71:28.38]And I'll take the shotgun too.
[71:29.65]Horse weapons.
[71:37.35]We'll circle around the far side and go down that way.
[71:40.13]Same as my kid.
[71:41.13]Yeah, that probably should.
[71:43.73]I'll get it right eventually.
[71:44.72]Yeah, just wasn't sure you agreed with me.
[71:49.86]Does this stay winter the whole game?
[71:50.94]Arthur, have you completely lost faith in me?
[71:53.98]Our needs right now are supplies, equipment, and a way out of here.
[71:59.88]Everything else, including comb, can wait.
[72:04.10]It is gorgeous though.
[72:07.40]Alright, so we're gonna go carbine.
[72:15.91]Not every area is snow.
[72:17.77]Well, it's good at least that they put it in.
[72:21.17]It's not just the desert.
[72:23.23]And only the desert.
[72:28.05]Take a shot every time somebody says okay.
[72:34.26]Alright, no fucking around here.
[72:35.48]No, like, look at how funny the streamer is jokes here.
[72:37.87]You know what I'm saying?
[72:40.09]And we already got that.
[72:40.87]We got a cinematic mode.
[72:42.07]Oh, LOL.
[72:42.71]And then, oh, I fell off three times.
[72:44.73]LOL.
[72:45.15]And then, you know, I'm not doing that again.
[72:46.47]Can they see us?
[73:03.70]I wonder if I should be crouched.
[73:10.20]I can't do it here.
[73:10.92]This is such a long walk down.
[73:12.88]Wait till I get the game to open up for me before I do any dumb shit.
[73:29.51]What a terrible stream.
[73:30.67]Hey.
[73:30.79]What?
[73:31.11]Why?
[73:31.23]What happened?
[73:31.82]I'm just playing Red Dead.
[73:33.10]Just jump off.
[73:33.68]No.
[73:33.78]One guy said that.
[73:34.52]Yeah, and he's the one guy now.
[73:59.33]Why do I always read negative feedback?
[74:01.15]Gosh, I need to make sure everyone's happy.
[74:03.07]And if people are not having fun, then I want to make sure you're having fun.
[74:14.06]Stay low.
[74:17.30]I really can't fuck this up.
[74:24.26]I gotta be on point here.
[74:26.45]No, like, where's the shed?
[74:28.09]Is that the shed?
[74:30.09]Why am I dropping frames?
[74:31.59]I don't... Is that a guy?
[74:32.95]No, that's a good guy.
[74:33.75]Take the lead.
[74:34.41]He's giving me an opportunity.
[74:55.97]Look at Dutch to give instructions.
[74:57.87]Send in the gang.
[74:58.45]I'll take the lead.
[74:59.19]Wait, that's a sniper elite thing?
[75:36.95]There we go.
[75:39.51]Tapping R2 when not aiming.
[75:40.95]Okay.
[75:42.53]This is the last guy.
[75:44.35]Oh, on top of the roof.
[75:45.53]Don't fall!
[75:46.41]Oops, sorry!
[75:47.57]That guy was making a video.
[75:50.31]I should have been quiet.
[75:51.39]That guy was recording.
[75:53.28]He's definitely laughing and screaming right now.
[75:59.64]Alright, I'm going to get over there.
[76:09.82]Fucking sensitivity!
[76:15.09]Lord.
[76:15.45]Apparently I got somebody.
[76:22.16]How, I'm not sure.
[76:38.87]Right in the head.
[76:40.22]Right through his hat.
[76:41.04]One more guy.
[76:41.46]Where is he?
[76:41.94]Right here?
[76:44.18]Oh, he just shot me right in the mouth.
[76:48.50]He shot me right in the face.
[77:07.74]Imagine getting shot right in the face like that.
[77:09.66]I could really just walk.
[77:18.91]Damn it.
[77:19.65]I got him.
[77:26.85]He would just be dead.
[77:30.22]What?
[77:30.40]Why did I shoot twice?
[77:31.50]Oh, that was the slow motion.
[77:33.00]Search the bodies!
[77:34.22]Strip everything we can from them!
[77:37.41]Oh, right.
[77:38.35]Is this 90 FOV, though?
[77:42.57]This just makes me want this to be on PC.
[77:47.31]There's so many corpses, though.
[77:49.41]How am I going to get them all?
[77:50.35]There is a slider in the menu.
[77:52.57]Is there?
[77:53.42]Doesn't know what camera.
[78:07.40]Okay, yeah, okay, it is there.
[78:11.70]Get that fucking head Bob off, please.
[78:13.58]Alright, cool.
[78:18.51]Does it, uh, fly immediately?
[78:25.77]Actually, that... No FOV number, it's just this one.
[78:33.92]Bar.
[78:34.90]Bar dragged to the edge.
[78:43.43]More of them are coming in right now?
[78:49.01]I didn't even get a chance to loot!
[78:56.04]First person.
[79:05.64]Well.
[79:08.47]Aiming sure is a thousand times better in first person.
[79:11.05]I will definitely say that.
[79:21.73]Defend.
[79:22.23]Is there Deadeye in this game?
[79:35.40]Damn, I don't know how to knock this cat off.
[79:47.96]Am I not even in cover?
[79:57.97]Oh, there is Deadeye.
[79:58.89]I can even like see it.
[80:02.07]Oh shit, no I didn't... Got that guy, he's dead.
[80:07.36]I don't have to worry about him causing any problems.
[80:35.11]Oh my god!
[80:43.24]I didn't want to- I don't like that.
[80:45.24]I didn't like that.
[80:46.20]Holy shit!
[80:56.48]Holy fuck, that was insane.
[81:02.47]Alright.
[81:08.07]New, uh... Oh, here we go.
[81:09.17]Weapon wheel.
[81:10.85]Deadeye tonics.
[81:11.69]Fully restores Deadeye.
[81:12.89]Okay.
[81:13.37]You can... You release to use them.
[81:16.17]Hides her identity while committing crimes.
[81:20.94]Okay, let's bring the rifle back up.
[81:22.48]Alright, let's keep looking around.
[81:23.48]I got this many bodies!
[81:25.68]Do it with the shotgun?
[81:26.60]Oh, lord.
[81:31.43]He didn't like it.
[81:32.09]He loved it.
[81:37.04]They're probably going to keep coming over here.
[81:39.00]I guess I have to do it.
[81:48.07]You can actually cut people's heads off in the game?
[81:51.21]My lord.
[81:56.84]Shoot the bodies with the shotgun.
[82:08.37]Oh, man.
[82:13.39]No way.
[82:16.93]No fucking way.
[82:18.06]That's insane.
[82:19.68]That's just brutal.
[82:26.34]Oh, man.
[82:26.94]This is brutal.
[82:30.47]This game ain't coming out in Germany.
[82:32.97]Like, no way.
[82:36.82]This game ain't gonna release in Japan.
[82:48.05]Is it out in like Germany and Japan?
[82:51.35]What do they do?
[82:57.01]Arthur, get over here!
[83:06.06]It is out, okay.
[83:07.07]We don't have time to mess around.
[83:11.65]The blood confirmed it is out in Germany, as is.
[83:13.99]Wow.
[83:15.93]We're waiting on you, Arthur.
[83:20.43]Hold on.
[83:20.75]Yeah, I have to loot everybody.
[83:22.05]You can't give me all these X's here.
[83:24.44]Now, let's tear this place apart.
[83:29.76]Bill!
[83:30.16]I got somebody's belt buckle.
[83:32.90]Mike, search that building.
[83:37.17]I will, but just hold on.
[83:38.42]There could be money on everybody.
[83:44.14]89 cents.
[83:45.28]I'm just collecting bits right now.
[83:47.62]What does this guy have?
[83:48.26]What does this guy have on him?
[83:49.10]Hey, thank you for the championship belt.
[83:57.07]Big bits.
[83:57.83]Alright.
[83:58.15]We'll look for like... Come on.
[83:59.65]What do you got?
[84:01.83]No.
[84:02.09]That guy's not even... That guy's not a sub.
[84:06.41]Come on, we don't even have, like, a sub?
[84:16.71]What?
[84:19.57]How many people here aren't even subbed?
[84:23.98]Alright, I gotta cut that out.
[84:31.90]No, Jesus Christ.
[84:33.12]Alright, what do we got here?
[84:38.19]He's onto us.
[84:40.83]He's... I'm not... No, I don't care if you aren't subscribed.
[84:47.17]Don't worry.
[84:55.22]Chewing tobacco?
[84:56.04]Cool.
[84:59.22]Pressuring fans.
[85:01.63]No, you guys know that it's not a... I don't care.
[85:08.29]What?
[85:09.60]Oh, there's an upper left.
[85:10.62]Oh, there's a Fortnite chest up here.
[85:12.82]What's in here?
[85:13.90]Epic?
[85:14.84]Is it an epic?
[85:19.18]Holy shit, somebody's... Hey, the great Lord Walden just gave out 20 tier one community subs.
[85:27.74]Thank you.
[85:29.18]Thank you so much, dude.
[85:35.48]20 subs here from Walden.
[85:37.03]Thanks, man.
[85:42.26]Oh my lord.
[85:42.86]No, no, this is not what I... Thank you for the 10 subs, Afric.
[85:48.39]Thank you.
[85:54.67]Oh, here it comes.
[85:57.63]I'm just going to keep my mouth shut.
[86:02.63]But thank you, guys.
[86:04.49]Unnecessary, but thank you.
[86:10.03]Alright, I gotta search up here.
[86:11.19]There's still things that I need to get.
[86:13.96]Okay, that hurt.
[86:19.12]What else is in here?
[86:23.66]Sub... Oh, there's a chest.
[86:25.43]I told you there's a Fortnite chest in here.
[86:29.81]Take.
[86:33.35]Take.
[86:33.59]Is it a knife?
[86:35.51]Two dollars and twelve cents.
[86:38.93]And cigarettes.
[86:44.95]Whoa.
[86:49.53]What is it?
[86:50.17]Is this dynamite?
[86:51.31]How would I even climb this?
[86:57.78]But thank you, though.
[87:01.56]Those guys giving all those subs.
[87:05.20]Really appreciate it.
[87:10.85]Train mission.
[87:11.27]I bought it.
[87:12.43]It's $20.
[87:12.57]What does dynamite smell like?
[87:14.71]Um...
[87:38.96]Raisins.
[87:39.32]No, that's tobacco.
[87:41.90]Gunpowder smells like... It's hard to describe.
[87:58.03]Just a few drops, right?
[88:03.39]It's gonna happen.
[88:07.33]I can't even get angry about it anymore.
[88:12.93]You know, there's no sense crying over spilled milk.
[88:17.29]They're already spilled.
[88:18.69]It's just gonna happen.
[88:19.71]Just thankfully it's not happening as frequently as it was at the beginning of this trailer.
[88:25.08]What do I think of the game so far?
[88:27.22]I think it's great.
[88:28.62]It's very atmospheric.
[88:29.08]Seems like it's going to be really fun.
[88:30.70]Even just that up there looks great.
[88:52.91]And we're just still in the tutorial, yeah.
[88:55.37]There's way more going on.
[89:02.02]Cowboy Skyrim.
[89:03.92]Yeah.
[89:08.14]That's not a bad thing, though.
[89:12.63]It really makes you feel like Spider-Man, that's right.
[89:26.75]Bring him back alive.
[89:28.65]We got it.
[89:32.52]Chase down and lasso O'Driscoll.
[89:39.14]So, do I get the la- hold and get the weapon wheel?
[89:41.32]This is gonna bring up the lasso.
[89:43.65]Okay.
[89:46.01]Hold L2 to ready the lasso and aim it at O'Driscoll.
[89:50.91]One of the most fun mechanics of the last game.
[89:53.63]Here it is.
[90:02.96]Okay.
[90:09.00]Keep L2 held and dismount.
[90:17.47]Press it...
[90:29.94]Let's interrogate him in the water.
[90:32.85]Let's drown this motherfucker.
[90:39.53]He got out.
[90:40.11]Where did he go?
[90:56.09]Oh, he's, uh, he actually is, like, getting drowned.
[91:02.95]He can stow him.
[91:04.13]Yep, drop him on the back of the horse.
[91:17.10]He might actually be able to drown.
[91:20.20]Maybe.
[91:20.60]Okay.
[91:26.03]Yellow line on the radar is the shortest route.
[91:28.73]In the yellow chalk.
[91:31.11]Press the thumbstick to pet the horse.
[91:35.37]Yeah, I got him.
[91:36.67]I got him.
[91:37.39]I gave him a little, hey, you're doing a great job.
[91:58.39]Thank you.
[92:03.17]Shut up.
[92:18.82]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, where is it?
[92:21.00]Come on.
[92:22.16]Come on.
[92:23.52]Come on.
[92:29.80]Oh well.
[92:31.79]Trying to shoot the bird.
[92:35.31]Can you throw dynamite at birds in this game, or does it follow them like in the last one?
[92:40.41]What bird?
[92:41.09]The bird that was on the right.
[92:43.71]Yes, that is still in the game.
[92:56.46]You can try.
[92:56.88]I mean, eventually we'll try.
[92:57.92]Seeing birds from other dimensions now.
[93:38.44]204 bones to go alright bring him to the fire and drop him in we're eating good tonight here we are you sack of let's introduce you to the boys hold near your horse to remove him alright don't hurt me please oh don't worry
[94:09.22]I would.
[94:09.60]No, I can't right now.
[94:10.73]We can't do that.
[94:13.23]I'm not doing that whole thing again.
[94:18.54]I got him.
[94:19.38]Very good.
[94:21.00]Welcome to your new home.
[94:21.74]I thought I was gonna start cutting him.
[94:22.90]Hope you're real happy here.
[94:25.58]You want me to make him talk?
[94:27.43]Oh no, now all we'll get is lies.
[94:30.95]Uncle!
[94:31.73]Mr. Williamson!
[94:33.19]Tie this maggot up someplace safe.
[94:35.65]We get him hungry first.
[94:37.63]I got a saying, my friend.
[94:40.93]We shoot fellas as need shooting, save fellas as need saving, and feed them as need feeding.
[94:49.28]We are going to find out what you need.
[94:54.10]I can't believe it.
[94:55.96]An O'Driscoll in my camp.
[94:58.22]I hate an O'Driscoll, mister.
[95:00.46]I hate that fella.
[95:02.00]Oh, whatever you say, son.
[95:04.50]Well done, Arthur.
[95:06.00]I'm just sorry we missed out on calling.
[95:08.06]Why am I still holding them?
[95:08.76]There's time enough for that.
[95:10.48]Now, I gotta figure out if we can hit that train.
[95:14.83]Okay.
[95:27.09]That's a long saying.
[95:37.16]Old friends complete.
[95:40.51]Now we got P on the map.
[95:42.81]I probably got an F. Complete the mission without taking any health items.
[95:51.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[95:52.15]I got a 25% on the test.
[96:04.25]Now let's keep going through the tutorial.
[96:09.54]No, I don't.
[96:10.02]I don't even need to get on the horse.
[96:11.26]He's literally right here.
[96:12.20]Stu, I'll take some.
[96:24.89]I'm gonna starve to death up here, Mr. Morgan.
[96:30.09]We're okay.
[96:32.76]We have a few cans of food and a rabbit.
[96:35.82]For what?
[96:36.20]10, 12 people?
[96:39.14]When I was in the Navy, I do not wish to hear about what you got up to in the Navy, Mr. Pearson.
[96:45.46]We were stranded at sea for 50 days, and you unfortunately survived.
[96:53.05]When we ran away from Blackwater, I wasn't able to get supplies in.
[96:57.99]Idiot screamer.
[96:58.91]Idiot screamer.
[97:00.68]Sometimes shopping trips need to be cut short.
[97:04.28]We'll survive.
[97:05.96]We always have.
[97:08.16]If needs be, we can eat you.
[97:09.86]You're the fattest.
[97:11.62]I sent Lenny and Bill hunting, and they found... Ew, gross, I mean.
[97:14.36]Fucking disgusting.
[97:15.10]Lenny's more than a book learning than hunting.
[97:17.88]Bill's a fool.
[97:19.72]Unless those mountains are full of game they want to read, ain't no wonder they found enough of this.
[97:25.08]We'll go find something.
[97:26.34]Come on, Arthur.
[97:28.19]Wait a second.
[97:29.21]Hold on.
[97:29.45]Here.
[97:31.61]You're gonna need something you got there.
[97:35.27]The sword had salted off.
[97:38.85]Is it weird that these gross shit items that are in these games, the rotten can of beans and packed in spam that's four years expired, I want to eat them.
[97:54.24]If I could pull that out of history and eat it, I would probably do it right now.
[98:05.95]Nobody else?
[98:06.37]Is this us, then?
[98:07.27]Oh, bow and arrow.
[98:07.85]You okay?
[98:08.29]Yeah.
[98:08.89]Yeah, man.
[98:09.13]Yeah.
[98:09.39]Careful.
[98:29.97]Match the speed of your cock spill.
[98:32.51]Is that guy on YouTube that eats the old military rations?
[98:36.71]Yeah, that channel's great.
[98:52.79]I've put on that guy's channel and just fallen asleep to him eating old rations and woken up with like 60 videos to play.
[99:01.84]Hold R when I tap square when he's stationed.
[99:07.93]I can throw him this move.
[99:14.61]Oh, you can, like, hold it.
[99:15.97]That's cool.
[99:16.81]Is that just showing off?
[99:18.97]I didn't... Wait, I'm not saying... What?
[99:22.51]I didn't say that.
[99:23.65]No.
[99:23.73]I've done that to your videos.
[99:25.81]Yeah.
[99:26.87]It just happens.
[99:55.81]Let's put this out on a tray.
[99:57.93]Yeah, I know the line.
[99:59.69]Come on, you don't think I've ever seen it before?
[100:01.28]Automatic cinematic.
[100:32.06]Coffee instant cheetos.
[100:33.52]Oh god.
[100:33.66]I wonder how big the actual map is when the game opens up for real.
[100:39.32]Now shh.
[100:39.64]Stay quiet.
[101:01.47]Do a Jerma impression?
[101:05.87]Okay.
[101:07.91]I was about to just wildly make fun of myself.
[101:11.97]Like, just make fun of me.
[101:14.51]No, I'm not doing that.
[101:18.52]Why would I do that?
[101:19.38]No.
[101:20.60]I've already done this before.
[101:22.56]I've already done it.
[101:30.76]I will track them on foot.
[101:33.70]You're going to need the bow.
[101:35.00]Don't leave it on your horse.
[101:36.60]The gun will scare everything around.
[101:38.79]Approach your horse.
[101:40.05]Don't use the gun.
[101:47.29]So what does this say?
[101:48.59]Use L2R to select a stowed weapon.
[101:52.11]Carbine.
[101:52.79]Bow.
[101:53.27]That's the one.
[101:58.99]You make less noise when you crouch.
[102:00.53]I'm not going to do it.
[102:04.68]I'm not going to shoot him in the head.
[102:10.02]I see him.
[102:11.82]You can use eagle eye to highlight animal tracks.
[102:21.48]Okay.
[102:22.85]Focus on the track.
[102:24.59]Nope.
[102:30.22]Enable eagle eye focus on the tracks to highlight them again.
[102:34.52]Okay, yeah, I see it.
[102:43.19]Your scent is also shown in eagle eye blowing in the direction of the wind.
[102:46.19]Animals will flee if they smell your scent, so remain downwind or far away when hunting.
[102:58.60]So, is that my smell going this way?
[103:00.60]Or are those his tracks, right?
[103:01.98]He's going to be up here.
[103:20.96]Stop track.
[103:21.64]I mean, I'm just going to follow it.
[103:25.32]22 miles per hour, top right.
[103:27.10]Which way is it going, though?
[103:30.96]Okay, this way.
[103:39.31]Unknown animal.
[103:40.41]It's gonna be a deer.
[103:44.21]22 miles per hour.
[103:44.89]That would be very... That'd be a lot.
[103:48.77]I don't see anything.
[103:49.55]Oh, there he is.
[103:50.15]Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[103:56.08]Am I close enough?
[103:56.80]I'm gonna have to do like a... Is it bullet drop?
[104:04.10]Aim for the head?
[104:06.07]A swing!
[104:24.77]Do I not go get the meat?
[104:29.76]Hunt another deer, okay.
[104:32.04]Well, I want to get the meat here.
[104:35.24]Selecting call while aiming at it.
[104:37.64]This will give you a chance of a clean kill as they raise their head before fleeing.
[104:44.47]So there's one over here.
[104:45.67]Do I need to walk that way?
[104:57.36]I mean, we get the 21 stink meter up there.
[105:04.64]Okay, I haven't even played God of War, the new one for PS4.
[105:08.67]But I feel like this happens in that game, right?
[105:15.67]This is like the same game.
[105:20.97]Something like that, yeah.
[105:22.09]Which way is it going?
[105:22.75]Okay.
[105:32.66]I mean, is this... Is it going that way?
[105:36.38]Or to the left?
[105:39.56]That, I don't know.
[105:40.40]Look at the tracks.
[105:46.11]I mean, those are tracks, right?
[105:48.43]Or did I make those?
[105:49.25]No, it's down here.
[105:58.31]What's the button to call?
[105:58.95]Oh.
[106:06.68]Fuck!
[106:14.30]I didn't even need to call them.
[106:15.38]Why did I even call?
[106:16.48]There was no reason for that.
[106:17.67]I made these tracks.
[106:31.77]Okay, there he is.
[106:40.98]Okay, got it.
[106:44.14]Okay, we can stop this now.
[106:45.10]Let's go!
[106:45.32]Oh, you actually pick up the whole thing?
[106:49.08]This is realism.
[107:04.94]The compendium tracks what you have discovered in the world.
[107:07.08]It can be accessed from the progress section of the pause menu.
[107:14.67]We found the realism.
[107:19.19]You can increase the distance that the horse will respond.
[107:24.06]Come on.
[107:28.92]There he is.
[107:32.66]In the head.
[107:33.36]No, I don't want to explode the team's head.
[107:35.80]Oh Not bad boy Alright, let's go yes you do no I don't I don't want to do it
[108:04.15]Meet up with Charles.
[108:06.39]Alright, Charlie.
[108:08.53]I'm coming.
[108:08.99]I want to see its brains.
[108:17.40]Jesus Christ!
[108:31.11]So you drop off carcasses to Pearson at the meat factory to contribute to gang supplies.
[108:38.65]Okay.
[108:39.37]Okay, you want to see the deer's balls?
[108:43.45]Everyone's freaking out about it.
[108:44.49]Alright, let's look at the deer's balls.
[108:45.83]The deer doesn't have any balls.
[108:49.62]Right.
[108:50.10]Okay.
[108:50.30]That's not how it works.
[108:51.52]You know, there are... You're probably right.
[109:09.84]See, I told you they weren't going to be there.
[109:11.41]I missed you guys.
[109:12.03]I really did.
[109:24.86]I unequivocally missed all of you.
[109:28.12]You notice how Pearson's had a bottle in his hand ever since we fled Blackwater?
[109:33.93]Easy.
[109:34.93]We give the camp cook five minutes to grab the essentials and go, and he doesn't even bring a crumb of food.
[109:42.88]Good that we caught more than one.
[109:44.86]We've only been up here a few days and have already picked up two more mouths to feed.
[109:49.47]One more.
[109:50.61]I bet Jerma doesn't even know me.
[109:54.01]Boy!
[109:54.40]Except maybe that can of salt and awful piercing was kind enough to give us.
[109:59.68]The girl.
[110:00.84]She has a wild look in her eye.
[110:04.00]Of course.
[110:05.58]She lost her husband, her home, everything she had.
[110:08.17]So what do we do with her?
[110:10.43]Well, once we get out of here and we're back on our feet, we'll see.
[110:14.61]She might have family somewhere.
[110:16.75]Who knows?
[110:17.55]Maybe she'll deal with the O'Driscoll for us.
[110:20.67]No, I'm not going to show the horse balls.
[110:23.27]That's too easy.
[110:24.49]I'm not going to shoot the horse's balls with an arrow like everybody wants me to do.
[110:28.42]That's not going to happen.
[110:29.64]Well...
[110:50.41]No one said that?
[110:51.15]Yes, they did.
[110:51.55]Oh, shit.
[110:51.85]Bears.
[110:53.17]No, don't shoot him.
[110:53.89]Am I losing?
[110:54.75]What's wrong with my arms?
[110:56.33]No, let it go.
[110:56.77]Let go.
[110:57.83]Let go.
[110:58.07]Let go.
[110:58.45]There you go.
[111:26.06]You're going awfully fast.
[111:28.20]Oh, the horse is... The horse is spooked.
[111:35.50]Okay.
[111:35.86]I'm gonna hold L3 to make the horse not... Can he see us?
[111:45.40]Fight bear.
[111:46.18]Fight bear.
[111:46.66]Right in the fucking head.
[112:01.20]Alright, let's get out of here!
[112:05.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[112:10.79]Alright, cinematic mode!
[112:12.37]He's screaming.
[112:19.84]Where's my friend?
[112:21.60]Come on, let's go, let's go!
[112:22.56]Why is he standing there?
[112:26.26]Is there a reason why he's just standing still up here?
[112:35.41]The bear's gone.
[112:35.99]Yeah, we're good.
[112:42.71]I'm in combat.
[112:43.45]No, I am not.
[112:54.32]Let's go.
[113:00.22]I have to fight the bear now.
[113:14.40]I need to turn it off for a second.
[113:16.50]Okay.
[113:17.12]Okay.
[113:17.46]Okay.
[113:17.72]Okay.
[113:18.10]Where's the bear?
[113:18.76]Where's the bear?
[113:28.42]I don't see a bear.
[113:29.96]Give me the fucking carbine.
[113:44.74]There's no bear.
[113:46.56]He's not here.
[113:52.08]Do you guys understand?
[113:57.53]Do you see a bear?
[114:09.13]I don't see a bear.
[114:12.54]Wait, tracks!
[114:16.12]Right there!
[114:25.47]Where the fuck is he?
[114:27.28]He's not here.
[114:45.58]I see him.
[114:48.49]No, you don't.
[114:48.97]I mean, look, the red marker is over here.
[114:54.23]Wouldn't you be over at the red marker?
[114:59.01]I'm out of stamina.
[115:00.01]I gotta eat.
[115:00.53]Hold on.
[115:02.43]Why did you guys make me do this?
[115:03.55]I was so close to the end here.
[115:10.80]Eat a can of beans.
[115:20.03]Give me a horse.
[115:23.13]You made you do this.
[115:24.85]You did this.
[115:28.76]There was never any bear?
[115:29.90]Why do I hear it now?
[115:39.90]Can we just leave?
[115:41.77]We can leave, can't we?
[115:42.71]It said, return to Charles.
[115:45.99]It said, go, hurry up and return.
[115:47.49]Where's my carcass?
[115:51.63]Fucking carcasses on the ground over here.
[115:53.20]That's what's happening.
[115:54.06]I get it.
[116:07.20]The horse is just as fucking stupid as I am.
[116:10.26]Alright, this is why I couldn't move.
[116:14.05]It has nothing to do with the bear.
[116:18.97]see everyone told me it's because I was in combat this isn't World of Warcraft we can just leave watch it alright let's go careful
[116:59.43]Who is this fucking bear?
[117:08.39]I softlocked the game?
[117:09.69]No, I didn't.
[117:38.60]We're fine.
[117:39.44]That's funny.
[117:46.49]Shoot bear with arrow.
[117:48.87]And my toddler brain was like, shoot bear with arrow, okay.
[117:52.55]I do think you say.
[117:53.73]I'm a caveman.
[117:57.81]Jerma, do that thing.
[117:59.65]I do thing.
[118:00.85]Me shoot arrow to bow to bear head.
[118:02.93]Me shoot bear.
[118:16.23]Chat's a good idea.
[118:18.93]I'm done with it.
[118:21.37]I was wondering if someone's gonna kill you in your sleep.
[118:24.27]I still wonder that most nights.
[118:29.10]This suits me.
[118:31.86]Sure, I could fall in with another gang, but Dutch.
[118:36.02]We laugh.
[118:37.58]We laugh at lowbrow joke.
[118:41.08]He treats me fair.
[118:44.58]We stream on Twitch with bad internet 20 years
[119:13.88]me try explain tcp IP to bogo I'm sure bogo throw rock at head that's why we need to stick by him through this he always sees us right
[119:40.22]How's that new horse?
[119:41.76]He's alright.
[119:42.58]It's a pretty nice movie.
[119:44.40]I appreciate you letting me take Taima the other night.
[119:49.35]She's a strong one.
[119:51.53]It's been as hard on the horses as on the rest of us.
[119:54.63]I don't know what Dutch would do if something happened to the count.
[119:57.44]It looks good.
[119:58.18]I'm streaming at 6,000 right now.
[120:03.54]I mean, when it's good, it looks great.
[120:05.37]Right?
[120:05.51]When it's bad... I don't know who the hell is calling me right now.
[120:08.43]But I cannot answer that.
[120:35.16]Sweet.
[120:35.52]Alright, let's see.
[120:36.38]So this upgrades.
[120:37.16]Did they go a Fallout 4 route here?
[120:41.55]Do I have to bring supplies and build stuff?
[121:05.07]What a surprise to find a camp rat loitering around in the kitchen.
[121:09.07]Is that any way to greet an old friend?
[121:11.09]I feel like we haven't spoken for days.
[121:13.21]I do my utmost to avoid you.
[121:15.31]He loves me, really.
[121:16.65]It's his sad way of showing affection.
[121:17.97]It's not forced, that's good.
[121:19.03]No, it isn't.
[121:20.37]Now shoot, get lost.
[121:22.15]Well, see you gents later.
[121:24.57]See, you got on just fine.
[121:26.55]Charles is a wonder.
[121:27.43]Have a drink, boys.
[121:28.75]You earned it.
[121:30.68]Have a drink.
[121:31.08]It's urine.
[121:31.76]Jesus, what is that?
[121:33.55]Navy rum, sir.
[121:34.81]It's the only thing.
[121:35.85]The only thing?
[121:37.95]Keeps you sane, it does.
[121:39.19]Yeah, seems to have done a treat on you.
[121:41.92]You go rest that hand, Charles.
[121:43.60]I'll be fine in a few days.
[121:45.00]Mind helping me with the skinning, Mr. Morgan?
[121:47.46]It's easier if we do it together.
[121:48.68]I'll get to skin you.
[121:51.38]You're always one with the jokes, aren't you?
[121:53.26]Come on.
[121:53.80]This really isn't a job for a man with a burnt hand.
[121:56.32]I'll see you both later.
[121:57.94]See, that guy has the quintessential haircut of end of the plate of spaghetti.
[122:05.61]Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, you can take this.
[122:06.95]I'm done.
[122:07.79]Are you sure you're done with that?
[122:08.59]Yep, yep.
[122:12.65]Go on, Arthur.
[122:13.57]Come on, get that knife working.
[122:16.89]Alright, let's do it.
[122:17.52]Just get him.
[122:22.18]Now shoot the deer.
[122:23.18]No, I'm not going to fuck up the tutorial missions.
[122:25.89]That was very quick.
[122:28.99]That's what it looks like in there?
[122:30.09]I thought it was wires and...
[122:34.36]Yeah, we said you were a butcher.
[122:36.74]Components and shit.
[122:37.94]Looks like that in there?
[122:39.42]Pretty much any town.
[122:41.04]If you're looking to make a legitimate bit of money, of course.
[122:44.51]I thought we just made animals.
[122:45.91]They're like computers.
[122:47.21]Well, if you catch anything else, sir, you bring it to me.
[122:50.99]Sure.
[122:52.53]Thank you, Mr. Morgan.
[122:53.93]Heck, Arthur Morgan's first decent bit of hunting after all these years.
[122:59.22]Yeah.
[122:59.92]You're not a Chuck E. Cheese.
[123:02.24]A few days later, you unlock the Master Hunter Challenge.
[123:22.91]Alright, tutorial complete.
[123:24.11]It's been a bad few weeks, but Dutch being Dutch, he is busy making plans and Dutch being Dutch, those plans involve robbery and dreams.
[123:39.38]Not yet, huh?
[123:40.68]Who the hell is Geviticus?
[123:43.04]I thought you was reading him his last rites.
[123:45.72]Now I see you're introducing him to your other passion.
[123:49.24]I'll mind you to show me some respect, Mr. Morgan.
[123:52.41]Mind away, Reverend.
[123:54.97]You're still here, then?
[123:55.77]I owe you.
[123:58.61]Then you'll pay me.
[124:01.63]For the moment, just rest.
[124:04.54]Porter!
[124:06.55]I think it's time for the train.
[124:08.31]Want me to come?
[124:08.91]Of course I do, but look out.
[124:12.19]Houston.
[124:12.47]That was always ugly, Dutch.
[124:14.25]It's just a scratch.
[124:15.31]Don't lie still, son.
[124:17.15]What's that kid doing?
[124:18.17]Get that kid out of here.
[124:19.11]This is an M-rated game.
[124:21.22]He's not allowed in here.
[124:23.18]You see me now.
[124:25.66]What's left of me?
[124:28.16]What about you?
[124:29.36]Guess I was hoping to see a corpse.
[124:31.69]He screamed, fix the desync.
[124:40.38]Railway man.
[124:41.82]Hold on a second.
[124:43.12]Tell me what happens here.
[124:44.12]Ready?
[124:44.46]At the water tower.
[124:45.56]Just before the tunnel.
[124:46.80]Ain't a problem.
[124:47.92]Why are we doing this?
[124:49.52]Weather's breaking.
[124:50.28]We could leave.
[124:50.86]How's that?
[124:51.24]I thought we was lying low.
[124:53.46]Come on.
[124:53.84]What do you want from me, Hosea?
[124:55.55]I just don't want any more folks to die, Dutch.
[124:57.87]We're living, Hosea.
[124:59.07]We're living.
[124:59.69]Look at me.
[125:00.63]We're living.
[125:01.45]Even you.
[125:02.61]But we need money.
[125:04.23]Everything we have is in Blackwater.
[125:05.81]Of course.
[125:06.53]You fancy heading back there?
[125:08.09]No.
[125:09.88]Listen, Dutch, I ain't trying to undermine you.
[125:13.40]I just want to stick to the plan, which was to lie low, then head back out west.
[125:17.66]Now, suddenly we're about to rob a train.
[125:20.28]What choice have we got?
[125:23.03]Leviticus Cornwall's no joke, Dutchie.
[125:25.43]Who is Leviticus Cornwall?
[125:27.61]He's a big railway magnate, sugar dealer, oil man.
[125:31.69]Well, how good for him.
[125:33.25]Sounds like he has more than enough to share.
[125:35.85]Better?
[125:36.74]Bad, bad.
[126:07.37]everything's mirrored I'm riding with the gang alright riding with the gang according to the information so kindly provided to us by the o'driscolls the train will become a street smells like peanut we're gonna pick it off after it crosses the border into the grizzlies there's a raised spot there I'm gonna get hit by it
[126:39.13]Why is the audio playing backwards?
[126:41.52]You know what?
[126:42.98]You know what?
[126:44.40]Don't you be coming back here now.
[126:48.48]I don't know why that just popped in my head.
[126:52.27]That's when you go to jail in the Monopoly game for Super Nintendo.
[126:54.59]I don't know.
[126:54.91]That just popped in.
[126:56.23]It just popped in saying hello.
[126:57.33]I don't know why.
[127:02.49]Have you got a problem with that?
[127:04.25]Not if you keep your head for once.
[127:06.64]You worry about yourself, huh?
[127:08.42]Enough!
[127:09.36]Just popped it.
[127:09.94]You know, just popped it.
[127:10.64]That bill blows the tracks.
[127:12.06]We're gonna need to move fast.
[127:15.32]Is everyone clear on what they're doing?
[127:18.32]I wasn't paying attention.
[127:19.40]Yes, boss.
[127:20.22]Good.
[127:21.45]Now come on.
[127:22.45]God damn it.
[127:24.09]Alright, rob the train.
[127:25.11]That's all I need to know.
[127:26.39]Come on.
[127:37.54]So what's the story about?
[127:38.94]Group of bandits, setting up camp, getting deer, and fending off other bandits.
[127:49.71]So far.
[127:51.09]And John Marston.
[127:52.61]Oh, he dead?
[127:53.21]He didn't die?
[127:53.53]What happened?
[127:56.49]That's a close one.
[128:04.70]Oh, this is pretty.
[128:05.80]Did we go to like zero?
[128:07.13]Looks like right over here.
[128:19.09]This looks great.
[128:19.63]Well, I was under the assumption that I was hopefully going to be live for at least a couple hours.
[128:27.10]Let's hope it's stable.
[128:28.32]Holy shit.
