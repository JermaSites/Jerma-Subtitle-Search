[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.48]Oh shit, people were betting on that?
[00:04.65]I didn't even see it.
[00:05.41]I didn't even know.
[00:08.93]I didn't even know.
[00:10.05]I had no idea.
[00:15.48]Two minutes late.
[00:16.20]Sorry, those of you that thought it was going to happen a minute and a half ago.
[00:21.60]You asshole.
[00:22.60]Look, I don't know you guys are betting on this stuff.
[00:30.65]You guys can't bet on whether or not I'm going to take a bath today.
[00:34.72]And if I decide, unbeknownst to you guys betting, that I don't take a bath.
[00:40.80]And half of you guys are watching like the Truman Show monitor going like, he didn't take a fucking bath today.
[00:46.07]Fuck him.
[00:50.91]I'm just sitting down.
[00:51.51]I don't even know what you're looking at.
[00:52.41]I know you have cameras in my house.
[00:53.49]What are you talking about?
[00:57.70]Anyways.
[00:59.00]Hi, guys.
[01:05.70]3.3 million.
[01:09.74]Wait, will Jerma be live in 24 minutes at 430?
[01:12.48]No.
[01:12.74]Oh, right.
[01:13.88]Okay.
[01:16.68]Today, we are going to do something that I've put off for a long time.
[01:21.98]We're going to play a game that I tried to stream like two years ago, three years ago, and it wouldn't work and it was all messed up and I had a lot of trouble streaming it.
[01:33.47]Well, we're back.
[01:35.51]That game is Spore.
[01:41.92]And you're probably wondering, why are you playing Spore, Jerma?
[01:44.56]I thought you told me two days ago that you were going to play Paper Mario Thousand Year Door.
[01:52.95]Well, you would be completely correct.
[01:55.19]I said, hey, yeah, that sounds, let's do that next, let's do that next stream.
[02:00.27]So I went through the process of looking into Thousand Year Door.
[02:05.99]Didn't realize the game was incredibly rare.
[02:08.22]I thought it was going to be as easy as just like going and getting it.
[02:15.68]It's a rare ass game.
[02:19.50]And all of you saying emulate it, emulate it.
[02:21.94]You want me to openly emulate a first party Nintendo game and tell you I'm doing it on stream.
[02:27.73]You're trying to get me fucking thrown in prison.
[02:33.78]There's one thing that Nintendo hates more than anything.
[02:37.21]It's emulating.
[02:40.65]Especially if somebody is actively there with, like, an audience of people going, Yeah, I emulated this shit.
[02:48.57]Why would I care?
[02:50.81]A slip will go onto my door.
[02:56.32]It'll be- It'll have, like, a bunch of stamps on it.
[02:58.02]It'll be from Nintendo themselves.
[03:06.33]No, I ain't emulating the first party Nintendo game.
[03:09.58]I'll find a way to stream it legally.
[03:11.34]I ain't fucking with that.
[03:14.72]I ain't fucking with Nintendo.
[03:16.42]They're ruthless.
[03:18.38]If they find out.
[03:25.89]Pepehands, he lied to us.
[03:32.94]So I said, you know what?
[03:34.82]Why don't we play a game that a lot of people have wanted to see for a long time?
[03:37.94]We're going to play Spore.
[03:40.44]And we'll probably do Spore for the next, depending on how good it is.
[03:44.55]I forget.
[03:45.01]Nostalgia is kicking in.
[03:47.47]I remember it being kind of fun.
[03:50.07]But maybe we'll do this for the next couple of days.
[03:51.99]We'll see.
[03:55.19]Just buy it on Amazon?
[03:56.13]Well, yeah, but buying it on Amazon is easy.
[03:59.47]The problem is that a lot of the shipping dates are not until February.
[04:03.09]Uh, what about the flashing?
[04:13.00]Yes, okay, I think I have fixed the flashing.
[04:19.77]since two days I didn't say February 1st I said February that does not okay some of you guys are way too literal with all information if I say the word February that doesn't mean February 1st at 1201 am that's not what that means it could mean like February 8th February 15th February 6th February 20th and some of them are expensive
[04:48.21]And I will pay $250 for Gacha Force, but I will not pay $250 to make sure I get Thousand Year Door here.
[04:57.15]Like, in four days.
[04:58.73]No.
[05:10.02]Cheap-ass motherfucker.
[05:11.28]I'm not even a cheap-ass motherfucker.
[05:21.13]Chad is deranged.
[05:22.87]I knew this was going to happen when I looked it up and I was like, oh shit, this is like kind of rare game.
[05:26.63]I got to figure out how to do this.
[05:31.09]I'm going to get it.
[05:31.87]I'm going to get it.
[05:32.40]Look, I might even do, I might even get one of the ones that gets here early.
[05:35.80]But nothing's ever guaranteed to get here early.
[05:45.96]Somebody, no, I'm not going to read that.
[05:50.05]Maybe you shouldn't plan things only one day in advance.
[05:53.52]That's how I operate.
[05:56.70]That's how I operate, man.
[06:00.50]This is the thing that a lot of the new viewers probably don't understand.
[06:03.92]So there are like huge projects that are like months if not years in the making that you will see on this channel.
[06:11.99]Everything else is planned 12 hours before a stream turns on.
[06:17.45]That's just the way it is.
[06:25.04]Got what it is here.
[06:30.38]And sometimes it's like 30 minutes before a stream turns on.
[06:32.95]I go, what's happening today?
[06:38.61]Leaf blower simulator.
[06:39.79]That sounds like fun.
[06:47.69]Planned decades in advance.
[06:49.53]And then you ask chat.
[06:50.71]Yeah, I'm like, chat, what do you think?
[06:55.34]What about Pikmin?
[06:56.50]You know what?
[06:57.56]Because, okay, listen to me.
[07:00.07]Because Paper Mario and the thousand-year-old door has been postponed until somewhere in the middle of February.
[07:08.35]I'm going to use my IOU card here.
[07:12.69]And we're going to play Pikmin.
[07:15.73]I'll give you a date when I figure that out.
[07:17.67]Because I don't want to say, we're going to play Pikmin 2 in four days.
[07:21.33]And I like go on Amazon.
[07:22.27]It's going to take six days to get here.
[07:23.89]Even with like Prime or something.
[07:25.75]I'm not doing that.
[07:27.49]I'm going to play.
[07:28.67]Which one should I play?
[07:30.97]It's Pikmin 2, right?
[07:32.00]Should I just do them all?
[07:39.64]If I play Pikmin 1, people that love Pikmin 2 are gonna be pissed that I played Pikmin 1.
[07:43.51]If I play Pikmin 2 first, people are gonna be mad that I skipped Pikmin 1.
[07:45.87]They're gonna be like, that's the best one, go play it.
[07:47.45]And if I play Pikmin 3, all of you are gonna be mad.
[07:51.05]Because that's universally the hated one.
[07:55.38]Nobody likes Pikmin 1.
[08:03.06]3 is good.
[08:03.48]Uh-oh.
[08:04.98]Did I just do it?
[08:05.52]Did I start the war?
[08:08.23]I'll do a poll.
[08:08.83]Alright, we're gonna do a poll at the end of this chat as to which Pikmin I'm going to play.
[08:13.51]By the way, I... Hold on.
[08:16.49]I think... I think I, uh... I think I already have one.
[08:34.89]Was I about to buy it twice?
[08:36.61]I forgot I owned it.
[08:38.56]Which one do I have?
[08:40.68]What's this one?
[08:41.88]It's not it.
[08:43.54]What's that one?
[08:44.52]Huh.
[08:44.76]I know it.
[08:45.50]I bought it.
[08:46.22]Here.
[08:46.34]Come on, this one.
[09:08.24]I have it somewhere.
[09:08.84]What's the one that's on Wii?
[09:16.10]One or two.
[09:17.72]One and two are on Wii.
[09:18.78]Huh.
[09:19.24]Both are on Wii.
[09:19.94]Okay.
[09:21.72]Let me see if I can find it.
[09:22.59]I actually think I really do own it.
[09:27.11]Alright.
[09:27.89]Let's go.
[09:28.17]We're going to play Spore.
[09:29.33]I forget everything.
[09:31.45]I fucking have no idea how to play this game.
[09:35.13]Find it.
[09:38.23]He has to find it already.
[09:41.88]Spore.
[09:42.42]Alright.
[09:43.00]So here for all you Spore Andes.
[09:46.44]Should I?
[09:49.72]Should I just play the start a new game?
[09:52.06]Or should we make a creature?
[09:54.10]What do you think?
[10:01.19]Should I just go with the DNA builder thing, or should I make a creature?
[10:05.67]I feel like if I make a creature right now, I'm gonna end up sitting here for the next, like, six hours.
[10:15.88]Just new game, just new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game.
[10:18.68]Okay, alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[10:20.16]Make a creature, you dickhead.
[10:21.78]Well, no, I'm not gonna.
[10:28.86]New game, please, new game, please.
[10:33.07]Do I do a poll?
[10:33.65]Alright, I'll do a poll.
[10:37.37]Just new game or make creatures?
[10:41.47]Oh, you're gonna... I have to desktop capture this.
[10:47.29]You're not supposed to see this shit.
[10:49.21]Hold on.
[10:56.72]That's just the background at all of, at every single one of your parents' computers.
[11:01.62]That's the background that's there.
[11:03.69]I just gave a bunch of you guys like weird flashbacks of going to like your grandmother's house.
[11:14.05]You want the truth?
[11:15.05]I gave you the truth.
[11:15.63]The reason why I don't have a three, a cool background is because I have three monitors.
[11:20.31]And I have no idea how to make it go across all three of them.
[11:22.87]And every time I do it, it stretches them and pixelates it and looks like shit.
[11:26.07]Even if it's at the right resolution.
[11:27.23]I haven't figured out how to do it yet.
[11:28.85]And I got three monitors like two or three years ago.
[11:31.86]So I just don't even care anymore.
[11:33.74]There was a picture of Carnage up at one point.
[11:36.34]And then... I think like the Pac-Man ghosts.
[11:40.36]And that was it.
[11:42.18]Google it.
[11:42.60]I tried to Google it.
[11:43.56]It didn't help me.
[11:44.06]Alright, what are we doing?
[11:45.86]What am I doing?
[11:46.62]Oh.
[11:47.22]Strawpoll.
[11:49.26]Alright, do you want me to start a new game and just play, or do you want me to make a creature specifically?
[11:56.13]Make a creature.
[11:58.69]Or start a new game.
[12:05.79]This is important, guys.
[12:06.99]Come on.
[12:10.09]This is important.
[12:10.71]What's the difference?
[12:12.74]I don't know.
[12:13.90]I have no idea.
[12:15.56]There's a difference.
[12:16.24]I know there is.
[12:17.95]When you start a new game, you like have to build like a creature from scratch or something, right?
[12:21.07]By eating food.
[12:23.37]But making a creature, you just get to make everything you want and build one and use it later.
[12:30.04]What are you writing?
[12:32.42]Make him see this.
[12:33.16]Make him see this.
[12:34.16]Jeremy, you got to make a couple creatures first.
[12:35.78]They can be shitty or cool or whatever you like.
[12:37.54]When you do that and then start a game, you will see those creatures inside the game you're playing.
[12:41.17]They're just the dumbass default Maxis created creatures.
[12:43.71]So please make some creatures first.
[12:45.83]Okay.
[12:51.92]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[12:53.10]Alright, so we're going to make a bunch of random creatures.
[12:56.52]This is going to take forever.
[12:57.42]Whatever.
[12:57.70]Welcome to the stream.
[13:01.45]Alright.
[13:01.71]Alright, here we go.
[13:05.35]I'm going to do that, and then I'm not going to make a creature for myself, though.
[13:12.04]That sounds like a plan.
[13:12.92]Let's go.
[13:21.24]I have a bunch of cool creatures, mate, if you want to add me as a spore buddy.
[13:23.98]I couldn't make an account.
[13:25.54]I tried to, like, five times.
[13:26.74]There's an error.
[13:27.34]Like, there's a server problem.
[13:29.44]Alright, so should I do a full creature or should I do little baby creatures?
[13:37.06]Do full creatures, right?
[13:42.54]Alright, here we go.
[13:45.99]Mmm.
[13:49.98]New game, idiot.
[13:51.08]No, I'm going to make a couple of creatures.
[13:52.48]Alright, so this is mild.
[13:54.92]Where's the body?
[13:55.66]This is the body, right?
[14:00.95]Let's go with... I want a standing creature.
[14:06.65]I kind of remember how to play.
[14:10.44]You can shrink the body and everything.
[14:13.80]You don't even know how the animals work.
[14:17.24]I have no idea how to play the game.
[14:19.40]I just remember... Okay.
[14:21.22]Here's what I remember about Spore.
[14:23.94]I played Spore like 12 years ago.
[14:28.41]15 years ago.
[14:28.81]And I think I did this for like an hour.
[14:31.07]Ran around and danced during the creature stage or something.
[14:34.63]And that's all I remember.
[14:35.59]I don't know anything else.
[14:36.37]Let's pull that spine back a little bit.
[14:44.79]That's what you do.
[14:45.53]That's all you do.
[14:46.29]Yeah, I know.
[14:47.26]That is all you do in this game.
[14:50.30]I think his head needs to be... There we go, like that.
[14:53.94]Pull these back a little.
[14:56.28]We want to give him a nice Chad posture.
[14:58.53]Align that spine perfectly.
[15:04.45]There we go.
[15:06.21]There it is.
[15:07.41]Perfect fucking spine alignment.
[15:10.46]Does it get a gamer neck?
[15:11.74]No, it doesn't.
[15:13.54]How's this a gamer neck?
[15:15.72]I guess that's what it kind of is He's supposed to be like a cha- no, alright, this is looking a little I want I do want to like a little bit of a gamer neck.
[15:36.40]There we go Jesus
[15:46.34]Okay, that's not bad.
[15:52.00]Do we have a beak?
[15:52.80]I don't know if I like the beak.
[16:07.49]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:09.33]It's a bird.
[16:09.94]No, but I don't want a bird.
[16:11.12]Delete.
[16:12.02]How do I delete?
[16:12.36]Delete.
[16:16.65]I kind of like this.
[16:17.45]No, no, no.
[16:17.99]A duck?
[16:22.40]Oh, by the way, can somebody that plays this game all the time... I have the new parts, right?
[16:26.96]Because I bought the whole package.
[16:29.86]These are extra parts, right?
[16:30.93]I do?
[16:36.23]No.
[16:36.79]What do you mean, no?
[16:38.73]It's not?
[16:40.97]No, no, no.
[16:41.77]You don't appear to have them.
[16:42.74]What?
[16:43.14]I installed everything.
[16:46.86]No.
[16:49.42]Really?
[16:50.26]I don't have all the extra parts?
[16:57.37]You do.
[16:57.75]You do.
[16:58.13]You do.
[16:59.25]You do.
[16:59.57]I didn't get scammed.

[17:02.33]You do.
[17:02.73]Alright.
[17:03.03]They're lying to me.
[17:04.11]Alright.
[17:05.08]What about this one?
[17:10.26]Right down here?
[17:13.08]Two mouths?
[17:15.76]I kind of like that.
[17:17.18]That's doing it for me.
[17:19.70]And it goes... Give him a tiny face.
[17:30.82]A huge underbite.
[17:32.00]Alright, hold on.
[17:39.08]It kind of looks like he's got a mask on.
[17:41.92]Alright, I like that.
[17:46.03]I like this one too, but that's alright.
[17:47.26]We can make more than one.
[17:50.18]How do I, um, zoom in?
[17:52.74]It's not mouse scroll.
[17:55.54]What's the, uh... Well, how do I zoom in with the mouse?
[18:01.56]Okay, that looks good.
[18:03.46]Eyes.

[22:57.27]Oh, shit.
[22:57.71]Hold on.
[22:58.29]He has like a saw blade on his stomach?
[23:11.06]Okay.
[23:12.74]I'm just making a battle bot.
[23:17.62]Silent hill monster.
[23:22.01]Okay, wait.
[23:22.47]That's true.
[23:22.93]That is kind of... What if they're on his, like, arms?
[23:28.81]Or their little T-Rex saw blades.
[23:33.65]Oh, I kind of like that.
[23:34.71]These are his hands.
[23:39.15]No, no, no, no, no.
[23:45.37]Mantis?
[23:45.77]I kind of like this.
[23:48.47]I want to flip him around, though.
[23:49.31]Because these are his arms.
[24:10.50]No, I don't like that either.
[24:12.58]This isn't even my creature.
[24:13.58]Why do I even care?
[24:16.49]Details.
[24:19.51]Gems?
[24:20.17]Like, I put gems all over him?
[24:21.59]Like, what is this?
[24:26.56]I can give him a little propeller?
[24:30.72]Oh, I love it.
[24:36.13]I love it, I love it, I love it.
[24:37.07]Hold on.
[24:50.51]Definitely keeping that on.
[24:53.11]What about some little, like, fluffies on his shoulders?
[24:57.11]On his knees.
[24:57.59]Okay.
[25:04.17]This is what every Jerma985 fan looks like.
[25:06.87]God damn it, I clicked out of the chat box.
[25:16.18]This is what every Jerma985 fan looks like.
[25:18.64]Alright, what do we got?
[25:19.12]We have singing.
[25:22.08]He's very good at singing.
[25:23.02]Okay, he's got a good mating call.
[25:26.90]He's got very good eyesight.
[25:29.72]He's kind of not that fast.
[25:31.71]He's got 40 health.
[25:32.71]Okay.
[25:37.39]Hold on.
[25:41.61]Should he have arms or not?
[25:43.19]No, definitely not.
[26:01.10]Give him some more legs.
[26:01.87]Maybe I'll give him some more legs.
[26:02.79]Hold on.
[26:10.51]Is his head too heavy though?
[26:11.63]His head might be too heavy.
[26:12.81]He's doing the Kubrick stare.
[26:33.31]I like them.
[26:33.83]Alright, good.
[26:36.17]Let's, um... Hmm.
[26:43.49]Change the color?
[26:44.13]Yeah.
[26:44.55]Alright, paint mode.
[26:45.17]What are you thinking?
[26:52.74]Uh, let's see.
[26:53.44]Green?
[27:00.70]Flesh, flesh, flesh, flesh colored.
[27:05.33]I kind of like the cantaloupe.
[27:12.47]I really like the cantaloupe.
[27:17.07]Yeah, it's perfect.
[27:18.55]Partial styles?
[27:21.59]Oh, you can do partial, right?
[27:22.63]Give him more legs.
[27:25.57]Hold on.
[27:30.05]He's got jumping legs.
[27:31.50]And how about...
[27:34.04]What about these weird ones in the front?
[27:35.74]Ooh, wait a minute.
[27:48.02]No, that looks ugly.
[27:57.09]You're going to ruin them.
[27:59.01]I'm just, I'm just looking.
[28:05.68]Just one leg in the front.
[28:11.36]You made a creeper.
[28:12.48]I did?
[28:13.58]I kind of did.
[28:15.72]Can you just do one single leg?
[28:28.10]It's a creeper.
[28:30.77]Even the flower on his head.
[28:36.74]I'll have to make a few more, so we're going to leave him alone.
[28:41.98]Doesn't the creeper have a flower?
[28:45.45]Who has a flower on their head?
[28:46.51]That's a fake fan.
[28:49.99]What enemy has a flower on their head?
[28:51.75]Oh, it's a Pikmin.
[28:56.10]It's a Pikmin.
[28:56.68]We just talked about Pikmin.
[28:57.72]Okay, that's what it is.
[28:59.86]Yeah, it's a Pikmin.
[29:00.94]Thank you.
[29:07.24]I kinda like the bear claws.
[29:10.85]Wait, what?
[29:18.51]Oh, shit.
[29:18.95]No, no, no, no.
[29:19.37]Should I give him, like, the bird feet?
[29:24.55]Bear claws or bird feet?
[29:25.45]Which one?
[29:29.03]Bird feet.
[29:29.93]Definitely.
[29:37.07]What's he doing?
[29:49.16]He did that with his feet, by the way.
[29:52.30]No arms.
[29:56.26]I like it.
[29:56.66]It's perfect.
[29:58.12]Those are hands.
[29:59.01]They are?
[30:05.26]Arms?
[30:06.94]I thought those were legs.
[30:08.03]Okay, we're gonna... Alright, that's enough.
[30:16.43]Name creature.
[30:20.35]Creature's name is gonna be... It has to be some type of cantaloupe.
[30:26.59]I mean, no.
[30:32.96]No, no, no, no.
[30:37.42]Can't afloat.
[30:40.74]Give him feet.
[30:41.48]Why does he need feet?
[30:43.67]Go feet.
[30:52.21]The creepalope.
[30:53.79]That's awful.
[30:54.97]I actually kind of like it though.
[30:56.05]The creepalope.
[31:26.12]There we go.
[31:30.29]Tags.
[31:30.99]Who cares?
[31:31.39]Alright, I'll say yes.
[31:39.49]Alright, there he is.
[31:41.09]Creepalup.
[31:44.46]Hold A when placing a part for symmetry mode.
[31:46.94]Okay.
[31:48.06]He unironically needs feet though.
[31:50.12]Does he?
[31:50.38]Unironically?
[31:52.14]Unironically?
[31:52.84]Unironically?
[32:01.04]Hmm.
[32:01.46]Am I buying these?
[32:07.17]No.
[32:07.39]Okay.
[32:10.49]Should we webbed feet?
[32:13.95]Oh, these bird feet.
[32:17.03]Yeah.
[32:19.85]Unironically, yes.
[32:23.33]Alright, fine.
[32:29.34]Alright, he's looking good.
[32:31.08]I think he's good to go.
[32:33.36]How do we say yes?
[32:34.91]Save and exit.
[32:35.59]I need to make another one, right?
[32:37.63]So save this one and exit and then do it again.
[32:39.35]I need to make like a few, right?
[32:47.67]This next one's going to be a hellish creation, by the way.
[32:58.67]I want to make like a big snake.
[33:00.87]No.
[33:01.63]Let's see.
[33:02.03]What do I want to do?
[33:06.77]I think I'm just going to make a snake.
[33:07.55]Yeah, I'm going to make a snake.
[33:11.22]Snakes don't have feet.
[33:11.92]There we go.
[33:17.38]Let's pull this back a little more.
[33:18.86]I'm going to make a scorpion.
[33:35.50]Yeah, definitely make it a scorpion.
[33:36.76]I want a big, dangerous tail.
[33:48.84]Okay, make this head smaller.
[33:52.32]Alright, good, good.
[33:53.32]Looks pretty good.
[33:54.98]Mouth.
[33:55.31]What kind of mouth does a scorpion have?
[33:59.85]Not that.
[34:00.97]But it's just a replace holder.
[34:02.89]It's kind of like this gross thing, isn't it?
[34:13.46]I don't know.
[34:13.76]I kind of like it.
[34:20.03]Won't he stab himself in the head?
[34:21.79]Ugh!
[34:33.56]It's perfect.
[34:35.30]Yeah, that's perfect already.
[34:38.66]Um, okay.
[34:42.43]now eyes not bad I love them okay what about a pig nose
[35:18.25]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[35:21.28]I don't, I don't want to, I think without a nose, it's perfect.
[35:26.48]Oh, should we give him one of these?
[35:27.24]No, he's perfect.
[35:28.50]Oh, I love him.
[35:29.36]Can I just be mine?
[35:30.32]Can this be my guy?
[35:31.13]Yeah, no nose.
[35:44.10]Just do nose holes.
[35:48.00]How do I do a nose hole?
[35:54.62]It's fucking angry.
[35:55.68]It's not angry.
[35:56.32]I like the little ears too.
[36:17.80]Oh my god, what?
[36:22.78]Okay, that looks alright.
[36:26.24]The ears might be too much, but I really like them.
[36:28.27]I do.
[36:30.55]It's an abomination.
[36:32.63]No, not yet.
[36:35.91]He's got to be lower to the ground.
[36:38.19]There.
[36:38.41]We're going to give him a bunch of centipede arms.
[36:40.25]What do we think?
[36:45.02]Centipede legs.
[36:46.54]That's what a scorpion has, right?
[36:49.95]Eye bones.
[36:50.83]Bug leg.
[36:51.33]There it is.
[36:52.73]Armored bones.
[36:53.43]Look at that.
[36:55.23]Bug legs.
[36:58.42]These are huge.
[36:59.46]These are way too big.
[37:06.12]They're gigantic.
[37:08.08]In order to get the... Whoa.
[37:10.27]In order to...
[37:12.06]In order to get the other parts in the mod, you have to launch Spore creepy and cute instead of the base game.
[37:16.42]Please copy this so he sees.
[37:19.02]Really?
[37:26.99]Really?
[37:28.37]Is that gonna fuck everything up?
[37:30.31]He already has them.
[37:38.13]You already have them.
[37:39.43]No, he doesn't.
[37:40.23]I don't know who to believe.
[37:51.56]Alright, shrink these legs.
[37:52.38]Sorry guys, destroyed on Huel.
[38:09.63]He's ignoring us.
[38:10.55]No, he has extra parts from an update, not the expansion.
[38:14.53]Really?
[38:14.81]Okay, if I save this, can I go back and edit this guy later?
[38:20.67]Remember, you have them.
[38:22.08]Top left.
[38:23.76]Exoskeleton.
[38:24.66]Core Spore.
[38:25.40]He doesn't have them.
[38:31.44]He doesn't fucking have them.
[38:32.62]Stop lying.
[38:34.10]His mouth and eyes.
[38:36.58]It's not them.
[38:37.36]That's not it.
[38:39.20]Chat, wrong.
[38:41.58]Not the DLC.
[38:42.68]What?
[38:44.04]Okay, so I'm just gonna save this right here.
[38:46.39]I'm gonna name this guy like fucking Bill.
[38:49.81]And then I'm gonna save and exit.
[38:50.85]Is that gonna work?
[39:02.98]Launch Galactic Adventures if you have it to get both DLCs.
[39:05.83]If not, then... Okay, so we'll have to launch Galactic Adventures?
[39:10.81]Why do they make it like this?
[39:12.03]This is fucking weird.

[39:51.11]Open Galactic Adventure.
[39:52.13]Hold on.
[39:52.37]Let me just make sure.

[40:15.30]Cat voice!
[40:18.30]Okay, let me open this.
[40:22.30]They tell me there's three EXEs.
[40:23.86]Let me just check on that and see what the heck is going on here.
[40:29.39]I don't think there is three EXEs.
[40:35.29]Spore.
[40:35.77]Spore bin.
[40:39.90]Spore bin ep 1.
[40:42.94]Spore app.

[41:02.92]No, it's the orange one.
[41:04.22]Yeah, that is that one.
[41:07.64]Alright, I think I'll be alright.
[41:08.47]Let me do this really quickly.
[41:14.74]Galactic Adventure is from Steam.
[41:17.42]Yeah, but I have to add some, um... I have to add the resolution thing that I have in the other one.
[41:28.77]Hold on.
[41:29.17]It runs at 1920 by 1080.
[41:30.35]I gotta make sure it does that.
[41:33.55]So Galactic Adventure will have all of them, is what you're telling me.
[41:36.17]We'll find out.
[41:39.75]It might be really loud.
[41:47.66]Hope it's not loud.
[41:48.16]I'm gonna turn it off.
[41:50.74]Okay.
[41:55.26]Here we are.
[41:55.68]In the game.
[41:57.99]That was incredibly loud.
[42:00.35]I'm so glad I just saved all of you.
[42:02.51]You can hear it through my headphones.
[42:04.23]This shit is unbelievably loud.
[42:12.51]Okay.

[47:02.11]They really are.
[47:02.67]I don't even know how to explain them.
[47:07.51]We already went over ants.
[47:09.33]Ants are just a math problem.
[47:11.31]They just follow code.
[47:13.39]Bugs are just living math problems.
[47:15.92]It's bizarre.
[47:24.26]Bugs are math.
[47:25.22]We already did this.
[47:25.94]We already went over how bugs are math.

[47:58.85]He's just using his head.
[48:02.50]Why is he leaning down like that?
[48:05.60]He needs two more tiny front legs.
[48:17.37]Does he?
[48:18.39]Two more tiny front legs?
[48:43.37]Like that?
[48:45.30]No, this looks like he's wearing a tie.

[48:56.62]Tendinitis.
[48:59.69]Tubular.

[49:12.57]Those are way too big.
[49:14.05]Way too big.

[49:24.60]And they go out like that, right?
[49:25.56]Yep.
[49:25.74]Pull these elbows in.
[49:28.00]This is way too huge.

[49:36.90]There we go.
[49:42.31]Well, actually, some scorpions have big arms.
[49:44.55]Like, huge hands and arms and stuff.
[49:46.51]Like the emperor scorpion.
[49:48.31]Yeah.
[49:49.21]I'm a viewer of Clint's Reptiles.
[49:50.87]Okay.
[49:51.43]I know what I'm talking about.
[49:52.36]And he gave it, like, a three out of... Two out of five.
[49:55.16]You don't want... Scorpions are hard to have.
[49:56.44]Okay.
[50:07.00]We need, like, lobster claws.
[50:11.22]I mean, that's the closest thing I'm gonna get.
[50:23.43]Just give him mittens?
[50:24.31]Should I give him big mittens?
[50:30.97]Give poison to the stinger.

[51:39.99]Oh, yeah.
[51:42.57]Yeah.
[51:52.57]This might be the best one.
[51:58.39]How about raver?
[52:00.97]That's a good one too.
[52:01.81]Hotfoot.
[52:09.41]I think we need to change the stomach a little.
[52:16.49]I'm happy.
[52:17.63]I need to laugh too.
[52:21.05]He's like a donkey.
[52:22.05]I love it.
[52:34.59]That's fantastic.
[52:35.59]Okay.
[52:38.06]So if he's a scorpion.
[52:43.31]Scorpions are usually like a beige color.
[52:46.31]Or sometimes a bright orange.
[52:47.39]And the bright orange ones are the fucking evil ones.
[52:58.59]Hmm.
[53:04.08]Yeah, the little orange ones are the evil ones.
[53:06.90]Hmm.
[53:14.57]Ooh, that looks kind of cool.
[53:18.26]The weird kind of like crusty hands.
[53:26.92]He has like deep fried hands.

[53:40.42]Could go red.
[53:44.67]Ooh, that's cool looking too.

[54:00.19]Ooh, I have to pick a clown.
[54:07.45]Not this guy.
[54:07.85]Alright, he's good.
[54:15.41]I gotta check.
[54:15.93]The body's gonna be a little different.
[54:17.21]Let me see.
[54:17.57]I don't want to ruin this.
[54:19.53]Don't you feel like the body needs to be a little thicker right here?
[54:27.78]Just by a little.
[54:36.61]He's down.
[54:37.13]Alright.
[54:37.59]Yeah, just by a little.
[54:38.41]Just a little.

[56:54.96]Alright, I think he's good to go.
[56:57.82]I think he's perfect.
[56:59.60]Somebody put poison on the tip.
[57:01.31]Can I even do that?
[57:09.20]Wait, I could put spit on this, right?
[57:11.80]Couldn't I?
[57:12.12]He just has like a weird, he's got like a muffin on his tail.
[57:15.96]Hold on.
[57:23.59]Okay, let's have him spit.
[57:24.85]This is like the combat.
[57:31.79]This punch, oh, he's back here.
[57:35.28]Bite, strike, spit.
[57:42.06]just goes into the air it's gonna go the hold on there we go hold on so he has like a poison gland that's right there that he can just spit poison at people after stabbing them
[58:11.18]It's an anti-air gun.
[58:13.90]Put it inside the spike.
[58:15.24]Can I do that?
[58:23.86]Oh, shit!
[58:24.88]I almost had it.
[58:31.87]What was it?
[58:32.19]Poison spit.
[58:36.01]Oh, it's the muffin.
[58:36.63]There it is.
[58:42.37]That looks kind of good.
[58:46.57]That looks really good, actually.
[58:47.83]That looks cool.
[58:51.64]He has a strike.
[58:53.32]He's got the charge.
[58:54.14]So he goes wham, then spit.
[58:57.70]Poison spitter.
[58:59.44]Cool.
[58:59.76]Alright.
[59:02.67]He's ready.
[59:07.33]I don't... Herbivore?
[59:08.47]Why is he an herbivore?
[59:11.06]Your creature eats fruit.
[59:12.14]No, he doesn't.
[59:12.58]I want him to eat other people.
[59:19.32]Because he has the mittens and has no teeth.
[59:21.42]Oh.
[59:25.77]I guess with no teeth and mittens, you're not going to be... So he's just a murderer.
[59:32.42]Change his mouth?
[59:33.94]I am not going to change this mouth.
[59:35.36]I don't care if he eats dirt.
[59:38.54]Are you serious?
[59:39.28]You want me to change?
[59:39.90]That's what makes all the personality from this guy.
[59:43.91]Add another mouth.
[59:45.77]Just like a hidden one underneath here?
[59:47.01]Alright, this is herbivore.
[59:51.61]Carnivore.
[59:55.27]What if I do this?
[60:11.61]This is fucking cursed.
[60:13.57]This is cursed.
[60:30.01]No.
[60:30.19]I don't want it.
[60:32.87]He can eat plants.
[60:33.73]Yeah, he looks so much better that way.
[60:41.47]Yeah, he can eat plants, but if anyone fucks with him, he can kill them.
[60:46.41]Make it really small.
[60:50.29]Hmm.
[60:50.89]Make it just tiny on his tail.
[60:57.31]I guess I could make just a little pincer, a little tiny one.
[61:03.69]Well, this is carnivore.
[61:05.23]I could put this like under here.
[61:06.19]That would just be kind of like a little thing under his belly.
[61:18.30]That doesn't look terrible.
[61:20.04]Make it small enough.
[61:32.38]That's just like a little addition.
[61:33.33]That doesn't mess up with his face.
[61:35.47]Put it on his nose.
[61:36.73]Hold on.
[61:39.85]I want to see what that looks like.
[61:40.67]Take it off.
[61:45.61]I cannot put it on his face.
[61:49.13]No, you know what?
[61:49.65]I don't even want it.
[61:50.61]I think it messes with the look.
[61:52.91]I want him to eat plants.
[61:54.90]I want him to eat plants.
[61:59.68]Yeah, I like him like this.
[62:03.12]I don't want him to eat meat.
[62:04.58]I want him to kill meat.
[62:06.59]Like, I want him to stab meat, but not eat it.
[62:09.55]This is a defense mechanism.
[62:14.33]Okay, what's his name?
[62:18.26]About, um... Scorp... Vegan?
[62:35.83]Vegan.
[62:36.61]Vegan Bill.
[62:46.25]Vegan Bill?
[62:50.77]Is that what you want?
[62:56.37]Duck-billed vegan.
[62:59.71]Carnivore bill.
[63:00.71]How about, yeah, like meat lover's bill.
[63:05.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[63:06.41]I'm going to make a circle and I'm going to make a meat lover's pizza.
[63:10.97]Yep.
[63:11.75]Alright, that's the next thing I'm doing.
[63:12.71]Save it.
[63:17.09]Say vegan bill as new creation or replace bill.
[63:19.97]Replace bill.
[63:20.71]Okay.
[63:29.30]How many more should I make?
[63:30.04]Like two, three?
[63:31.66]This is fun.
[63:32.12]Alright.
[63:32.76]I'm going to make it to meat lovers pizza.
[63:35.96]This will be quick.
[63:44.86]It's just going to be a large meat lovers pizza.
[63:46.98]This is too thick.
[64:01.12]I know what to do.
[64:02.86]Make a tiny, tiny body and a big circle head and just put all the pizza ingredients on his head.
[64:08.42]Shorten the spine.
[64:12.10]Oh, that's true.
[64:12.64]Okay.
[64:15.04]Alright, so this is good.
[64:15.92]There we go.
[64:23.84]It needs to be a little bit like there.
[64:29.30]Put this in the oven.
[64:31.64]Alright, meat lovers pizza.
[64:32.52]We need like cheese and then sauce.
[64:35.66]First of all, let's get the base here.
[64:40.68]That looks like a pretty good crust, but hold on.
[64:51.20]That looks like a- that's perfect.
[64:52.70]That's a perfect, like, pizza crust.
[64:55.24]Yep, keeping it.
[64:59.58]Okay, now we need... ...details.
[65:03.73]What do we got?
[65:04.19]Definitely some fucking basil on there.
[65:10.63]No, that comes later.
[65:11.34]That comes after the sauce.
[65:12.20]What am I doing?
[65:20.98]Alright, what, like pepperonis or something?
[65:24.38]What looks the most like pizza?
[65:25.86]Ingredients.
[65:28.57]These, I mean, this could be.
[65:29.53]Custom paint?
[65:33.27]Do custom paint, custom paint, custom paint.
[65:35.23]Hold on.
[65:37.59]Uh.
[65:38.97]Paint like, paint like.
[65:40.41]How do we do custom paint?
[65:44.51]Base.
[65:45.03]Okay, hold on.
[65:49.63]A coat?
[65:54.72]Yes.
[65:55.66]No, this one.
[66:02.14]And the detail.
[66:03.00]I don't think we need any detail.
[66:08.45]I think that's perfect.
[66:13.69]We need cheese on it, though.
[66:15.65]This kind of looks like cheese, but it's too much.
[66:17.25]It has to be on top.
[66:19.30]Here we go.
[66:22.63]That's pretty, that's as close as it's gonna get.
[66:24.83]Or not, maybe, hold on.
[66:32.64]Hmm, put black olives on it.
[66:44.82]Hold on, we're not, we're gonna, we'll, just wait.
[66:48.11]Change the base color?
[66:54.89]Diseased pizza.
[66:58.11]Those spots kind of ruin it, though.
[66:59.37]Here's the color of the detail and coat.
[67:07.18]Nice red pizza sauce.
[67:09.02]Actually, I like the other one better, don't you?
[67:11.40]Do you think this one's better?
[67:23.89]The bright one you think is better?
[67:24.93]Actually, it probably comes up better.
[67:26.05]Alright, detail.
[67:29.65]Detail's got to be white.
[67:35.36]Cheese.
[67:35.72]I can hold?
[67:46.89]Oh, okay.
[67:47.17]Okay.
[67:56.64]This is probably close to pizza sauce.
[67:58.10]Yeah, look at that.
[67:58.70]That's perfect.
[68:00.50]Take the spots off.
[68:01.34]Yeah, I'm taking the spots off.
[68:02.59]I can use cheese with something else.
[68:06.25]Yeah, remove spots.
[68:11.65]Fix the crust.
[68:12.72]Hold on.
[68:18.56]Alright, let's go back here.
[68:23.36]Now, the pizza sauce is up here.
[68:27.72]This could be like a sausage or something.
[68:36.90]Oh, fuck yeah.
[68:37.58]Look at this.
[68:41.33]Can I make these like pepperoni?
[68:45.59]Can I make them tiny?
[68:46.97]Can I change the color of these?
[68:56.06]I don't think I can change the color of those.
[68:57.16]Of the eyes.
[69:01.33]Come on, really?
[69:01.87]Can't change the eyes?
[69:05.59]They're just olives.
[69:11.96]Yeah, but I need... How many black olives?
[69:14.10]Black olives are disgusting on pizza.
[69:27.59]All olives are, like, gross.
[69:37.81]That's a lot of olives.
[69:39.87]I need some... Oh, wait, wait.
[69:40.69]We need, like, basil.
[69:46.82]Actually, I love olive oil.
[69:48.22]I love it so much.
[70:01.28]How do I... You hold Alt to get just one, right?
[70:07.37]How come I can't get one?
[70:08.17]Hold A. Oh, okay.
[70:14.63]I'm thinking like here.
[70:18.25]Bring it down.
[70:18.99]Flatten it.
[70:19.39]Oh, yeah.
[70:20.11]Twirl it a little bit.
[70:20.85]That looks good.
[70:22.33]So nice and cooked.
[70:24.05]And then put it down.
[70:24.87]That.
[70:26.91]Okay.
[70:27.19]Okay.
[70:35.40]Twist it up a bit.
[70:37.70]Nice.
[70:38.34]Looks good.
[70:38.94]Okay.
[70:40.13]One more.
[70:46.25]One more, like, right here.
[70:52.13]Hit it a little more.
[70:52.70]Drink it.
[70:55.82]Okay.
[70:56.36]Cool.
[70:56.70]Alright, now we need cheese.
[70:57.56]We need... There we go.
[70:59.54]This could be, like, weird cheese.
[71:00.68]Cheese.
[71:03.19]That's kind of cheesy.
[71:05.17]What's more cheesy do you think?
[71:11.89]Like this?
[71:14.59]Flowers could be cheese.
[71:17.34]What else we got?
[71:23.32]Horrible.
[71:24.32]Hold on.
[71:26.40]This could be like mozzarella.
[71:28.44]Yeah, that's like a nice mozzarella.
[71:31.49]Answer me, you flimsy fuck.
[71:33.53]What are you talking about?
[71:35.55]The armor plates.
[71:38.82]Armor plates.
[71:42.96]That looks like a nice... That looks like a fucking nice slop of mozzarella.
[71:51.74]Oh, fuck yeah.
[71:52.78]Perfect.
[72:05.25]Yeah, it's like a Neapolitan.
[72:21.72]I need to move these around a little.
[72:27.36]Okay, so let me move these around.
[72:28.78]They need to be a little bigger too, because it's like the big mozzarella circles.
[72:36.36]There we go.
[72:36.88]That's better.
[72:37.24]This is a meat lover's pizza with no meat.
[72:42.05]That's just regular pizza.
[72:47.91]You should make the creature flat.
[72:50.53]How do I do that though?
[72:51.37]Can I do that?
[72:51.87]Can I squish him?
[72:56.77]What about the pepperoni?
[72:57.59]I need something red.
[72:59.18]Just flatten him.
[73:06.42]Miscellaneous parts from the details.
[73:12.01]I need red though.
[73:12.87]Wait, that could be, no.
[73:15.67]Flatten the armor plates.
[73:24.71]It's as flat as I can get them.
[73:28.79]Actually, it's good that they're different sizes though.
[73:30.31]Like mozzarella does that on pizza all the time.
[73:40.06]It melts different ways and shit.
[73:41.42]Oh, yeah.
[73:42.10]Yep.
[73:43.72]Yep.
[73:43.86]Are there warts all over it?
[73:47.85]Okay.
[73:51.97]How about... If I turn one of these upside down, it might look like a pepperoni.
[74:03.83]That just looks fucking weird.
[74:05.02]I hated that.
[74:07.90]Alright, he has eyes.
[74:09.20]It's technically olives.
[74:10.08]He needs a mouth.
[74:15.71]You should just have this.
[74:18.41]Is this like a dragon pizza?
[74:31.42]Now it's a carnivore?
[74:39.01]Demon pizza.
[74:40.15]And it can sing?
[74:40.93]He needs feet, does he?
[74:50.37]Even just little tiny ones that you can't even see.
[75:00.09]He needs legs.
[75:00.95]Hold on.
[75:01.35]Do you have wings?
[75:05.25]Just a flying pizza.
[75:06.29]That's a good idea.
[75:09.16]Where are they?
[75:17.40]Flying pizza.
[75:18.49]Wings.
[75:18.97]Wings.
[75:19.39]Jump and sprint.
[75:21.19]Sprint.
[75:24.41]You don't need feet.
[75:26.35]Feet aren't required.
[75:27.23]Okay, well I want them to fly though.
[75:58.64]This is just unnerving.
[76:08.80]I don't think he even needs a mouth.
[76:19.81]It looks like a watermelon.
[76:20.81]Hold on.
[76:24.61]Take the mouth away.
[76:34.05]I mean, I like that better.
[76:34.90]I'm not sure if I'm happy completely with it.
[76:46.70]Mouth is one part that you actually need.
[76:48.44]Okay.
[76:49.87]Ballet.
[76:54.61]Oh, that's what it would look like if you dropped a pizza on the ground.
[76:57.25]Okay.
[77:06.65]You know what's, like, funny?
[77:07.85]I bet you there's a ton of pizza places that have this pizza with wings on it.
[77:11.73]And underneath it, it says, we deliver.
[77:13.30]I mean, doesn't it feel like this would be on the box?
[77:29.01]A hoedown.
[77:40.06]flipping the pizza around alright I think I think I like them I think that's good mating call make the dough brown hold on let's just let's check here
[78:10.77]Brown, you say?
[78:11.51]Hold on.
[78:11.87]No, the dough's not brown.
[78:19.62]It's like this.
[78:22.52]It's like a pizza crust.
[78:28.62]Looks like a meatball.
[78:32.84]This one's better.
[78:35.98]We go into yellow.
[78:36.68]Hold on.
[78:40.98]Rotten.
[78:45.48]There we go.
[78:45.92]Perfect.
[78:54.87]How do I change his face?
[78:55.79]Alright, looks good.
[79:04.17]How about just pizza?
[79:07.39]What's a dragon term that starts with P?
[79:11.91]Meat lovers pizza.
[79:12.75]Pizza angel.
[79:17.87]Aerodactyl.
[79:29.11]Where'd the sauce go?

[83:10.37]This is what a carrot looks like when you pull it out of the ground.
[83:11.99]What are you talking about?
[83:13.91]Give him a scary mouth.
[83:32.81]I like that.

[84:23.62]How about I make a carrot?
[84:25.86]A carrot.
[84:30.39]You guys think, oh, he's so high right now and all he can think about is food.
[84:34.97]I don't- I can't think of one person I've ever seen that's ever been high and you go, hey, Ben, you want to get some munchies?
[84:40.28]Yeah.
[84:41.24]How many carrots?
[84:43.80]I got fucking Doritos and pizza and fucking- and hamburgers?

[84:51.64]I've never heard that before.
[84:54.20]Somebody's never been high and asked me for a carrot.
[84:55.78]I'm just going to tell you guys the truth.
[84:56.86]That's never happened.
[84:59.82]You know how many times somebody's been over here high or hanging out with me high in my life and they've gone into the pantry and they're like, where are the Doritos?

[85:27.58]There's no way that you guys are... This is a gaslighting campaign.
[85:32.01]I don't think there's ever been a point where one of you was asked for a carrot when you were high.
[85:36.45]If you were, ever.
[85:38.93]No, you reached for the fucking beef jerky in the Dorito bags.
[85:46.40]I don't do drugs, Jerma.
[85:47.74]Well, good for you because don't do them because they're not that cool.
[85:51.24]They're kind of dumb.
[85:54.40]All I'm saying is I've never asked for a carrot when I was high.
[86:00.91]Hey, man, you got any bags of iceberg lettuce just plain that I can just reach into and just eat?
[86:13.99]That's a based take.

[109:34.26]Start at the very beginning.
[109:34.94]Nurture your own creation from its humble aquatic origins to its evolution as a sentient species in the epic journey of Spore.
[109:43.76]Or go right to the space stage.

[109:48.94]Okay.
[109:49.98]Choose your diet.
[109:51.06]Herbivore or Carnivore?

[112:40.41]What's Earth in Marvel?
[112:51.23]I don't know.
[112:52.07]Zirconoff4900?
[112:53.55]What's the... 6-1-what?
[112:54.65]This is the worst name I think ever.
[112:58.64]Zirconoff616.
[112:58.90]It's like the Marvel Earth.
[113:17.93]It's just the planet is Zircan, okay?
[113:20.89]Done.
[113:33.80]This is loud.
[113:34.58]Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[113:49.63]Oh, it's a pretty planet.
[113:51.11]I love the purples.
[113:52.05]The purple and the orange and the... There I am.
[114:04.98]There I go.
[114:08.46]I'm going in.
[114:09.29]Don't you have to eat stuff?
[114:14.98]Here I am.
[114:15.40]I don't know how to play.
[114:17.02]Welcome to the tide pool.
[114:18.24]Throughout Spore, the choices you make impact your future.
[114:21.76]As a cell, your mission is to eat, grow, and evolve.
[114:24.08]Growth is measured in your progress bar below.
[114:26.74]Cool.
[114:29.58]That's your progress bar.
[114:31.46]As you eat, you'll earn DNA points.
[114:33.40]You may spend these points on new parts to evolve your cell.
[114:36.64]As you progress, you grow larger and your world expands.
[114:40.38]Hmm.
[114:42.04]You eat, you get DNA points.
[114:43.62]Then you spend those DNA points on new parts.
[114:47.26]You're a carnivore.
[114:47.82]Hunt other cells or swim over floating meat to eat it.
[114:55.91]Eat that.
[114:58.73]Eat that.
[114:59.47]Why did you not eat that?
[115:00.21]Ooh, I got it.
[115:08.34]I gotta eat all these other bugs.
[115:12.64]So I can't eat both?
[115:13.96]I can't eat that.
[115:14.88]He doesn't like it.
[115:15.40]Okay.
[115:22.46]Oh, I just grew up.
[115:24.76]Now I can eat the little grubs.
[115:30.14]Watch out.
[115:32.66]Other cells and meteor bits are the key to finding new parts.
[115:36.38]Each part has unique abilities that can benefit your cell.
[115:39.34]When you see the new part appear, swim over the token to collect it.
[115:44.32]Game doesn't have auto-save.
[115:45.96]Please, please, please.
[115:46.96]You'll fucking lose everything.
[115:48.92]Make sure to say it often.
[115:50.69]Make beanbag Sonic.
[115:52.29]Alright.
[115:58.93]Saved.
[116:00.77]Game on planet Zircan is saved.
[116:04.25]Zircan.
[116:06.52]Zircan.
[116:09.08]What the fuck?
[116:09.78]Okay, I got a new part.
[116:10.66]Attack and bite.
[116:11.52]Can I use it?
[116:16.79]Call a mate to enter the cell creator.
[116:18.83]Oh, there's a mate.
[116:19.33]Where?
[116:21.27]You and me.
[116:26.55]Wait, no, that's not a mate.
[116:28.67]There's a mate.
[116:30.25]Come over here.
[116:42.01]You can change modes in any creator by clicking on the mode button above.
[116:45.90]Before returning to the tide pool, stop by paint mode to spruce up the new look.
[116:50.18]Okay, cool.
[116:51.92]Too expensive.
[116:54.32]I can bid a spike.
[116:57.00]This is not too expensive.
[117:01.30]The same thing, though.
[117:03.53]I wish I put this attack beak.
[117:06.81]Hmm.
[117:08.25]Right there?
[117:09.25]On the sides.
[117:13.47]Right in the front like that, right?
[117:15.82]Definitely like that.
[117:19.70]Right there.
[117:21.38]Perfect.
[117:21.72]Okay, what about paint mode?
[117:30.90]What should I do?
[117:31.47]Spotted?
[117:31.81]Hmm, I don't know about that.
[117:39.47]Dots.
[117:45.05]I like that a lot, actually.
[117:54.08]Yeah, I'm keeping it.
[117:55.50]Name your species.
[117:57.14]Oh, shit.
[117:59.14]How about a Jermamite?
[118:10.75]Let's go.
[118:15.83]There he is.
[118:16.25]Hunt cells or break open meteor shards to unlock new parts.
[118:22.02]Just keep eating.
[118:24.42]Is there a quick save button?
[118:32.88]Eat, eat, eat, eat.
[118:37.09]No.
[118:37.67]Okay.
[118:37.81]I'm looking for meteor parts.
[118:43.63]Oh, I grew up again.
[118:47.29]I'm with the big boys now.
[118:49.46]Oh my god, oh my god, leave me alone.
[118:52.64]Oh my god.
[118:57.38]This dude is so hungry.
[118:58.82]Holy shit, get away from that.
[119:01.43]Get away from Flowey.
[119:07.53]What the fuck is that?
[119:16.24]No, don't eat me.
[119:21.01]I'm going this way.
[119:23.13]I feel like I'm playing Agario.
[119:27.47]Agario, that game is... I played it for like a couple of days.
[119:33.67]People would just work together and... I'm going to die.
[119:35.42]I'm dead.
[119:37.84]Three or four people would just work together and just feed each other.
[119:40.34]What just hurt me?
[119:47.41]Eat it!
[119:49.29]Ow!
[119:54.39]No!
[119:55.93]No!
[119:56.35]Get away!
[119:56.87]I'm dead!
[119:57.81]Oh, I'm okay.
[120:09.31]I thought there was no saving.
[120:10.19]Didn't you guys say there was no saving?
[120:21.47]I need to eat more stuff.
[120:25.13]Ow.
[120:26.95]That's not a save.
[120:30.91]Come here, come here, come here.
[120:32.01]Eat, eat, eat.
[120:32.39]Up, up, up, up, up.
[120:32.89]Alright, I grew a little bit.
[120:34.31]Eat all these motherfuckers right now.
[120:35.43]Eat them.
[120:39.89]Don't go that way.
[120:42.27]Don't go that way.
[120:42.79]Go down.
[120:43.25]Don't go that way either.
[120:43.87]I don't know what all that is, but...
[120:54.01]Eat this bee.
[120:55.85]Come here.
[120:56.85]Yes.
[121:01.26]Get away from me.
[121:06.66]Oh, a cell.
[121:07.90]No, it was a bubble.
[121:08.46]Never mind.
[121:08.76]Are those things alive back there?
[121:21.11]Little guy right there.
[121:23.65]Come here.
[121:25.27]Oh, never mind.
[121:26.33]You have to defend yourself.
[121:29.99]I don't have any moves.
[121:33.79]Oh, they're coming for me.
[121:34.51]They're coming for me.
[121:35.01]Look at that huge claw in the background.
[121:38.24]You have spikes?
[121:39.54]How do I use them?
[121:44.12]Holy shit, this thing is huge.
[121:45.28]Oh, it's a crab.
[121:45.90]It's a big crab.
[121:46.90]Ram him.
[121:58.22]Come over here.
[122:02.68]Come here.
[122:06.87]This guy's way too slow.
[122:11.81]Too slow.
[122:12.53]He's so slow.
[122:13.43]Eat.
[122:16.75]Get the fuck away from me.
[122:21.06]This is my food.
[122:24.84]Evolve.
[122:25.72]Can I?
[122:28.72]Should I call for a mate?
[122:30.16]You have to evolve.
[122:31.00]So I call for a mate.
[122:37.33]Anybody here?
[122:40.75]Let's go.
[122:41.11]Come on.
[122:41.37]Hurry.
[122:47.23]Alright.
[122:51.45]What do I want to do?
[122:54.17]I filter.
[122:54.87]You get green.
[122:55.75]You can eat.
[122:56.51]You eat green plant buds.
[123:00.81]Speed.
[123:01.57]Ooh, I got 15.
[123:02.31]I can do that one.
[123:07.50]Probably in the back, right?
[123:08.26]Like this?
[123:09.04]Yeah.
[123:11.84]Extra speed.
[123:16.00]Can I afford anything else?
[123:19.71]No.
[123:20.87]Add spikes.
[123:21.17]Spikes.
[123:24.21]No, I don't want to add spikes right now.
[123:25.29]I want to be able to move fast.
[123:32.46]Make them a little smaller.
[123:34.72]Remove the spikes.
[123:37.56]Sell the eye?
[123:38.48]Why would I sell the eye?
[123:40.42]What are you talking about?
[123:45.95]I'm doing this.
[123:47.93]Let's go.
[123:50.13]Wait, how much do I get for selling the spikes?
[123:53.29]No, I'm just going.
[123:54.25]What do you mean listen?
[123:54.77]I'm not going to listen to it.
[123:55.55]I'm holding it.
[124:00.74]Now I go faster.
[124:02.32]There we go.
[124:02.78]That's better.
[124:08.80]What are they eating?
[124:09.34]Here we go.
[124:13.47]Bigger.
[124:15.93]Now.
[124:17.83]Run, run, run, run.
[124:19.47]What's that?
[124:24.76]Go to the moon.
[124:27.06]What?
[124:28.68]Wait, that's one of my friends.
[124:33.16]Should I eat my own friends?
[124:34.64]Should I eat the... Should I cannibalize?
[124:38.76]Wait.
[124:40.00]I gotta scavenge.
[124:41.88]Get away from me.
[124:44.52]No, get away from me.
[124:51.97]Why can't I save the game?
[124:52.95]Oh.
[125:01.19]I don't think I can kill these guys if I smash into them.
[125:13.66]You're too fast.
[125:14.48]Come here.
[125:15.18]No, you.
[125:18.15]You can.
[125:18.73]You literally can.
[125:19.67]Yeah, I know there's a space part of the game.
[125:22.71]You want to fuck around?
[125:26.81]Ooh, flippers!
[125:30.25]Wait.
[125:31.77]That's mine.
[125:32.19]Get away.
[125:35.53]Where'd those flippers go?
[125:44.26]Dab him!
[125:46.04]Run.
[125:46.22]I already got them?
[125:49.12]Alright.
[125:50.58]I have seven dollars.
[125:51.50]Is that enough to mate?
[125:55.36]Get away from me.
[125:55.76]Get away from me.
[125:56.21]Get away from me.
[125:57.05]No!
[125:57.75]Don't kill that person.
[125:58.43]I need that person.
[126:00.79]Let's go.
[126:11.63]Ooh, fast turns.
[126:12.87]I need 15.
[126:13.21]Shit.
[126:15.15]Can I get another eye?
[126:28.12]Sell the tail.
[126:32.61]Sell the eye.
[126:33.69]Sell the eye.
[126:36.15]Sell the spikes.
[126:37.85]No, the... What?
[126:39.95]No.
[126:40.62]Sell the tail.
[126:41.62]No!
[126:43.00]I need this for speed, don't I?
[126:47.70]Make him just have... Sell the eye.
[126:52.44]Why did I do that?
[126:57.98]Flippers are better.
[127:00.67]Are they?
[127:01.93]Fast turns.
[127:13.26]Like that.
[127:16.96]And then... I gotta get an eye again.
[127:23.23]Get the eye.
[127:24.99]You fuckers.
[127:39.38]Alright, I think that's alright for now.
[127:43.40]Make these big.
[127:44.18]Okay.
[127:48.09]Let's go.
[127:58.35]You don't need eyes.
[127:59.31]I don't, but that doesn't seem kind of weird that I don't.
[128:03.18]Why would I not need eyes?
[128:09.60]I grazed him.
[128:10.40]Shit.
[128:17.84]Shit.
[128:18.22]Okay, he missed too.
[128:19.70]Got him.
[128:21.11]Come here.
[128:23.93]Get over here.
[128:24.31]Watch out for the octopus.
[128:32.47]Good.

[128:34.03]Oh!
[128:35.63]Oh!
[128:39.78]What did you just do?
[128:43.45]Give me that.
[128:43.79]I want that.
[128:45.55]Run.
[128:45.87]Okay.
[128:51.15]Save it here.
[128:51.47]I can kill you.
[129:01.62]Wait, does he have hard skin?
[129:04.98]No, he doesn't.
[129:05.73]Come here.
[129:07.01]Get over here.
[129:13.31]Come on, eat.
[129:17.87]Jet?
[129:18.25]Hold on.
[129:18.53]I don't want to evolve yet.
[129:19.91]I need to get... I need some more points.
[129:25.73]What the hell?
[129:26.39]Holy shit, that was terrifying.
[129:27.53]Alright, keep going.

[129:46.92]Holy shit, I just stabbed him.
[129:49.36]Wait a minute.

[130:59.80]Okay.
[131:01.00]I want full health before I go over there.
[131:03.24]I know it.
[131:03.62]I want to eat that guy.
[131:04.38]I know that's east.
[131:07.48]I want to get health.
[131:09.05]I have no health.
[131:10.11]There was a huge guy over here.
[131:14.97]Where is it?
[131:18.10]There's a current here.
[131:18.72]I can't.
[131:24.82]Come here.
[131:37.37]I'm going for it.
[131:38.93]I'm going for it.
[131:39.57]I don't even care.
[131:41.15]In the eye.
[131:43.11]Stay on his backside.
[131:45.95]He can't turn fast enough.
[131:51.43]There's going to be so much meat.
[131:59.67]Don't let somebody else kill him.
[132:02.99]Gold rock.
[132:04.53]I saw a gold rock, but this is important.
[132:08.57]Gold rock.
[132:11.63]Ooh, nice.
[132:12.88]Spit poison.
[132:13.88]Cool.
[132:15.82]I need to kill this guy, though.
[132:16.64]He's almost dead.
[132:17.94]It's going to be a frenzy over here when this thing dies.
[132:26.29]Oh man, oh man, what's that?
[132:30.05]Run, run, run!
[132:30.95]Get this fucking block out of the way!
[132:32.35]What the hell was that?

[133:09.51]I'm too afraid.
[133:10.07]I thought you were going to cut me off.
[133:24.86]I spiked him in the mouth.
[133:33.13]That hurt?
[133:33.51]Fuck!
[133:38.97]Alright, I need a mate.
[133:50.60]Let's evolve.
[133:55.31]I need a mate.
[133:56.41]Give me a mate quick.
[133:58.01]I have so many more things to put on.
[133:59.23]Come here.
[134:10.80]Yes.
[134:15.34]Okay, I have 19 points.
[134:18.27]I got a jet, which is 25.
[134:19.83]I have a proboscis.
[134:23.70]You eat green plants or living cells.
[134:27.67]Okay, hold on a minute here.
[134:31.45]This is the carnivore.
[134:33.51]This is the omnivore mouth.
[134:37.37]Take this mouth off.
[134:38.47]How much is it?
[134:39.49]25.
[134:39.67]I need to... Can I get a view of his face?
[134:58.73]It's all the eyes.
[134:59.37]I can't do a single... There it is.
[135:17.12]It has to be a little bigger, right?
[135:20.22]Yeah.
[135:21.06]So I can like...
[135:25.04]Spike's back here.
[135:25.82]Alright, I've got 14.
[135:29.06]Which is... This is a jet.
[135:31.67]25.
[135:31.97]I could get rid of these.
[135:33.81]Is the jet faster?
[135:39.05]The jet's faster than this, right?
[135:41.45]Okay.
[135:46.67]I don't have any eyes.
[135:47.61]Do I need eyes?
[135:56.28]No eyes.
[135:56.76]It's fine.
[135:57.32]Shut up.
[135:58.17]Okay.
[136:00.19]Don't need eyes.
[136:02.27]Well, I'm ready.
[136:02.71]Let's go.
[136:07.81]So you need eyes.
[136:08.83]Eyes are incredibly important.
[136:10.16]Great.
[136:13.86]Eyes are insanely important.
[136:25.46]Well, not really though.
[136:27.40]Get in there.
[136:33.68]Eat up all this shit.

[143:20.54]Oh, look it.
[143:21.30]Okay.

[143:27.38]Alright, I gotta eat some more plants.
[143:28.38]Alright, I need more.
[143:31.28]I'm not eating any more meat.
[143:33.13]Only plants from now on.
[143:37.71]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[143:41.03]Relax, what am I doing?
[143:49.15]Alright, more plants.
[143:50.94]Just sit here and snack on this.
[143:54.16]This would be perfect.
[143:56.12]Hey, get the fuck out.
[144:01.43]I didn't even want to do that to him.
[144:02.63]He just, that guy just killed himself on me.
[144:04.87]I didn't even want to eat that guy.
[144:13.36]Nice.
[144:13.64]Alright.
[144:14.40]How am I doing?
[144:17.00]Alright, we're almost into Omnivore.
[144:20.78]I won't eat any more people.
[144:22.30]Just plants.
[144:25.95]Just pieces of algae.
[144:32.39]Are you kidding me, dude?
[144:34.57]No.
[144:37.45]They're working together on me.
[144:39.23]Get away from me.
[144:40.05]They're like tag teaming.
[144:43.34]Seriously?
[144:43.80]How we doing?
[144:52.17]Almost there.

[145:00.20]Get away from me!
[145:26.81]No more killing.
[145:27.69]I just want to eat plants.
[145:32.35]I just want to eat boogers.
[145:33.47]There they are.
[145:35.07]Call a mate to sell creative.
[145:36.74]Well, hold on.
[145:41.98]Not yet.
[145:42.32]It's not time yet.

[145:52.55]Here we go.
[146:01.51]Save.
[146:01.93]Okay.

[146:07.53]Yeah, I think I'm getting close.
[146:09.60]Give me that.
[146:10.90]Don't even think about it.
[146:14.22]Okay.
[146:14.49]I wonder how many more plants I have to eat before I'm considered an omnivore.
[146:21.51]Two more up here.
[146:27.49]Good.
[146:27.85]That guy just saved me.
[146:31.59]So close.
[146:36.46]I'm so close.
[146:46.97]What did I just drink?
[146:54.24]I didn't drink a person, did I?
[146:57.02]Get away.
[146:58.62]Ow!
[146:59.08]Get away.
[147:02.65]What's going on?
[147:04.67]Oh no!
[147:05.17]I'm a carnivore!
[147:07.37]I'm a carnivore and I have a brain now.
[147:13.55]You're on the path to sentience.
[147:17.13]When it comes to swimming in sludge, you rule the pool.
[147:18.79]When you're ready to stretch your legs in the big wide open, click the advance button.
[147:22.09]Not yet.
[147:22.39]I need a few more pieces of food.
[147:34.01]No.
[147:35.87]How many more do I have to eat?
[147:41.11]Just keep eating plants.
[147:48.53]Eat like 10 to be safe.
[147:49.77]Okay.
[148:04.06]Fuck.
[148:04.32]Should I evolve before I advance?
[148:07.71]Or save the points?
[148:18.02]Get away from me.
[148:19.08]I'll kill you.
[148:23.70]I'll kill you.
[148:29.10]I'll kill you if you don't leave me alone.
[148:32.00]Ow!
[148:34.46]They're ganging up on me!
[148:35.48]I have to drink his blood!
[148:38.43]Fucking come on!
[148:44.97]Press T?
[148:50.10]I'm an omnivore!
[149:00.84]Alright, so I'm just going to evolve one more time.
[149:06.36]Wait, just one more, just in case.
[149:13.05]Come here.
[149:21.07]save the points no no no stop save the points okay oh god please no oh god no okay alright I'm fine sell everything save your points alright I'm ready
[149:45.01]This timeline shows a history of the actions you've taken during life as a cell.
[149:48.85]You've established a trait which earns you unique abilities that will benefit your future generations.
[149:52.33]Which path have you chosen?
[149:55.80]Chosen the path of the killer.
[149:58.04]And then I've rescinded my ways and went up to the path of the omnivore.
[150:08.28]Cool, okay.
[150:15.30]Finish the cell stage and clamber onto the planet's surface.
[150:20.65]Ooh, OK, here we go.
[150:22.79]It's time.
[150:28.05]It's like an airplane.

[150:42.84]Beanbag Sonic.
[150:51.74]I think I'm gonna make a mosquito person.
[151:04.65]Make the fly.
[151:09.43]How many points does this take?
[151:12.47]50.
[151:13.01]Oh, I only have 70 points.
[151:14.19]Hold on.
[151:15.61]I gotta think this through.
[151:21.94]I could get poison spit.
[151:28.57]Poison spit, like on the head?
[151:32.75]Electric.
[151:36.65]Or charge.
[151:37.61]How about electric?

[151:45.73]Sell the fins.
[151:52.02]Sell the jet too.
[151:53.06]Yeah, that makes sense.
[151:55.44]Okay.
[151:57.42]These are just spikes.
[152:04.15]That makes sense.
[152:04.59]Are they all 50?
[152:10.71]They're all the same speed.
[152:12.41]Okay.
[152:18.38]Just make Q-Bert.
[152:35.56]He's kind of cute, actually.
[152:38.96]He's a little lopsided.
[152:39.96]I'll fix that.
[152:40.54]Hold on.
[152:40.80]He needs to be a little shorter.
[152:56.27]I don't like how tall he is.
[153:04.57]He's so cute.
[153:06.95]It's the Pixar lamp.
[153:08.05]Well, whatever.
[153:08.57]That's fine.
[153:09.01]Let's get a big proboscis.
[153:13.89]Whatever it is.
[153:28.33]Don't give him eyes.
[153:29.92]The horn's good for attacking.
[153:34.95]I still have 60.
[153:36.01]What else?
[153:36.51]Poison spit?
[153:39.97]Electric?
[153:45.68]Electric on the top of his head?

[153:55.56]I'm going electric.
[154:01.99]Okay, cool.

[154:30.75]Hold on.
[154:31.39]Do I?
[154:35.17]Fins for jump.
[154:35.97]Fins for jump.

[156:02.22]He's ready.
[156:02.86]He's good.
[156:03.46]Let's take a look at the color scheme.

[156:11.77]He's cool.
[156:19.03]Alright, let's do it.
[156:29.36]Creature stage.
[156:30.12]Randomizing data archetypes.
[156:34.51]Excreting gastrodermal system.
[156:39.61]Reticulating spines.
[156:42.43]Oh, we got somebody from Maxis.
[156:43.71]Maxis, Maxis, Maxis, Maxis, Maxis.
[156:46.42]Where am I?
[156:48.44]Where are my people?
[156:50.68]Where are the people that I made?
[156:51.80]I thought you guys said to make a shitload of people so they would be in the game.
[157:06.91]You made that for the tribal stage.
[157:09.07]Oh.
[157:13.05]They'll show up.
[157:13.57]Oh, okay, okay.
[157:15.47]We got out.
[157:16.31]It's time for us to shine.
[157:18.85]It is the beginning of a new day.
[157:20.41]And for you, a whole new strange and wondrous world.
[157:24.39]Air fills your lungs as you stretch into your limbs in your new home.
[157:29.45]Dry land.
[157:30.95]The race to evolve has begun.
[157:32.71]Good luck.
[157:35.48]Now you are a creature surrounded by your nest mates.
[157:38.00]To evolve, you need to meet the other species on this planet and earn DNA.
[157:42.46]Earning DNA moves your progress bar.
[157:44.32]Let's take a look.
[157:46.24]This bar... They're really ugly.
[157:47.82]This bar shows your progress.
[157:48.84]Fill it by building relationships with other species or forcing them to become extinct.
[157:54.81]Okay.
[157:57.17]Here are your objectives.
[157:59.95]As this goal suggests, food is critical for your survival.
[158:02.65]Let's learn how to look around to find some food.
[158:06.00]Hold down right mouse button to rotate the camera.
[158:12.93]Left click on the ground to move your creature.
[158:14.47]What are they doing?
[158:21.89]Oh, I found some food!
[158:25.43]What's that?
[158:29.51]What's this?
[158:29.85]You just got a new part.
[158:30.77]Imagine the cool stuff you'd find on even bigger creatures or skeletons.
[158:35.27]Click the mating call button below to find your mate and enter the creature creator.
[158:38.11]This is where you can change your look and add the parts you found in the world.
[158:42.19]Mm-hmm.
[158:43.17]Cool.
[158:49.30]Okay, eat fruit or meat.
[158:51.68]I found fruit.
[158:52.18]Did they eat too?
[159:00.72]W-A-S-D.
[159:01.38]Oh, thank you.
[159:02.58]And jump.
[159:02.94]Alright.
[159:04.92]What the hell happened to this guy?
[159:12.08]Um... Okay.
[159:19.97]Save the game.
[159:20.59]Save, save, save, save.
[159:22.35]Man.
[159:28.74]This is a thousand times better than that dumb evolution game you played.
[159:35.27]Can I call them over to eat?
[159:36.33]Alright, go find a new species.
[159:41.87]Alright, I'm going to go find a species.
[159:43.05]I found little frogs!
[160:01.41]Who's this?
[160:01.75]You've met a new species.
[160:02.65]Care to make them a friend or foe?
[160:04.74]Set your stance and get ready to sing or snarl at your found neighbor.
[160:09.88]Your stance says whether you will attack or play nice with another creature.
[160:13.40]Before you interact, click on the green button to make friends or the red button to make dinner.
[160:18.62]Then use each ability button.
[160:21.28]Completing the self stage has earned you a special ability.
[160:23.16]Click this button to use it.
[160:25.66]Summon Fluck.
[160:34.05]What am I doing?
[160:42.26]Nothing happened.
[160:43.84]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[160:44.40]Easy, easy.
[160:44.96]There's more.
[160:45.76]Who are these people?
[160:47.08]Alright, I want to be friends.
[160:53.15]Look at that cool light bulb.
[160:54.71]What do you think?
[160:56.53]Mimic the other creature to impress them.
[160:59.15]We can say- Who the fuck are these people?
[161:01.58]Who are these things?
[161:02.62]I didn't make these.
[161:05.42]Well done.
[161:05.84]To the victor go the spoils.
[161:06.95]You are on your way to a bigger brain and a smarter you.
[161:14.95]Cool.
[161:15.29]Alright.
[161:15.57]Hey, you.
[161:17.37]Let's be friends.
[161:25.92]I can't do that.
[161:27.52]Impress to flurgle to ally.
[161:31.66]Oh, impress to flurgle.
[161:32.90]Let's go over here.
[161:38.79]I can do that.
[161:39.21]Pretty cool, huh?
[161:45.09]Alright, so now I need one more flurgle.
[161:47.43]What do these guys do?
[161:48.11]Impress six moon work deeds to ally.
[161:52.90]Once allied with the species, you can heal at their nest.
[161:55.04]I guess I'm... Impress them?
[161:58.34]He just sang the raid song.
[162:06.02]Hahaha.
[162:12.20]How do I tell... Come here, look at me.
[162:19.48]How do I tell these people to leave?
[162:23.22]Don't be mad.
[162:23.78]I'm here.
[162:24.10]We're just hanging out.
[162:25.06]Do I just stick my mouth in his eye and just suck his blood?
[162:31.70]Ooh, fruits!
[162:37.37]Come here.
[162:38.87]Look, I'm going to be your friend.
[162:43.58]Okay, sing.
[162:46.74]Ah, we're now friends.
[162:47.80]Locate your mate.
[162:50.32]The flurgle are your allies.
[162:52.44]Okay.
[162:53.56]Cool.
[162:57.60]Do they care if I eat all their food?
[163:01.11]Look at the map.
[163:03.17]Yeah, there's a home nest.
[163:07.73]Locate your mate.
[163:12.99]Can I make a new mate?
[163:17.25]Consume them.
[163:19.31]No, I'm going back to the nest.
[163:20.29]Ooh, a new eyeball.
[163:27.42]I'm just going to find parts to evolve, right?
[163:33.48]Should I keep eating fruits?
[163:39.94]There's another species over here that I haven't seen.
[163:42.86]I'm going to check this first.
[163:45.06]Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind.
[163:46.36]What do you mean?
[163:47.62]I wanted to go down there.
[163:48.34]You missed bones?
[163:52.36]I did?
[163:52.56]Oh, there they are.
[164:02.26]Oh, a big mouth.
[164:03.06]Alright, I'm going to go back to the nest.
[164:12.03]I was just pushing you.
[164:12.91]Sorry.
[164:18.41]Eat some more fruits.
[164:20.45]Can I bring these back to the nest?
[164:23.12]Is my nest eating?
[164:24.86]Wait.
[164:25.04]There's a new species over here.
[164:27.42]Oh, it's like weird slugs.
[164:30.64]Hold on.
[164:34.16]Hello.
[164:37.54]Impress three gom to ally.
[164:41.62]Okay, come here.
[164:46.10]Oh, you like to sing, do you?
[164:47.74]Me too.
[164:50.06]Interesting.
[164:55.01]Oops.
[165:00.51]Why am I so angry looking?
[165:02.19]I'm very angry.
[165:12.11]It's an ultra rare item in front of you.
[165:14.79]Hold on.
[165:21.45]There's some grass.
[165:22.21]I got arms now.
[165:24.99]You're friends?
[165:25.55]You like me?
[165:26.07]Okay.
[165:28.82]Go into the ocean.
[165:30.42]Hold on.
[165:30.80]I have to make friends with these guys.
[165:46.20]And that was their king.
[165:47.28]What's going on?
[165:56.88]Oh, my brain's getting bigger.
[165:58.10]Is this when I make friends with people and then just like destroy them?
[166:06.14]Brainpower, you got a little smarter in taking your first step towards sentience.
[166:09.45]You've earned the ability to entice an ally to join your pack and help you on your adventure.
[166:15.42]Members of your pack will help you attack or make friends.
[166:17.54]Notice you have room for one.
[166:19.98]Socialize with an ally and they will join you.
[166:21.86]Go to the water.
[166:33.72]Save the game.
[166:34.36]Alright.
[166:36.41]Am I going to instantly die if I go in here?
[166:42.31]I'm not instantly dead.
[166:43.33]I thought it was going to kill me.
[166:48.27]Alright, I'm good.
[166:51.07]I don't want to make anybody my, like, friend yet.
[166:53.81]Wait, who's that?
[166:57.83]Move with the keyboard?
[166:58.69]I know, I'm just forgetting.
[167:01.13]Where's my mate?
[167:01.73]Do I have a mate?
[167:05.09]I don't even have a mate.
[167:24.97]What's happened?
[167:29.66]Oh!
[167:33.78]It's an ultra rare item in the water.
[167:35.32]It's called dying.
[167:36.14]Wait, why are there two?
[167:40.58]Wait, who am I?
[167:41.30]Did another one just get born?
[167:47.61]What's happening to them?
[167:58.39]Oh, okay.
[167:59.27]We can do a new mode play.
[168:01.65]Test drive.
[168:02.31]Yep.
[168:02.61]Okay.
[168:05.19]You want him to have a different mouth?
[168:06.53]Wait, what about one of these weird beaks?
[168:10.81]This is Omnivore.
[168:11.77]Mating call.
[168:12.43]Bite.
[168:13.11]Sing.
[168:13.45]We're getting rid of the thing in the face.
[168:23.58]Bite.
[168:24.64]Sing level 2.
[168:26.66]Sing level 2.
[168:34.86]Rare parts on other content.
[168:39.52]Okay, and then I got the beak.
[168:48.91]Okay.
[168:49.85]I got 71 points left still.
[168:51.41]What about eyes?
[168:51.99]I guess it just depends on what you want to look, see.
[169:03.40]Should I get hands now?
[169:06.37]It's 50, but I mean, I can have arms.
[169:12.35]I kind of have to have arms.
[169:15.21]I have to get arms.
[169:16.15]100%.
[169:16.67]Yes.
[169:19.95]And I need another leg too.
[169:22.31]Oh.
[169:30.24]Let's pull this forward a little.
[169:39.77]Make the foot a little bigger.
[169:41.19]Yeah.
[169:48.08]Quite the evolution in one go here.
[169:50.94]Take out the fin.
[170:05.64]Hold on.
[170:05.90]I need to make this bigger.
[170:06.68]There we go.
[170:08.83]Okay, that's better.
[170:14.91]There we go.
[170:24.84]That's a little too much.
[170:27.94]That's pretty good though.
[170:28.76]I like that.
[170:29.58]That's not bad.
[170:30.04]Put the fin on the arms.
[170:37.87]Need a second fin.
[170:51.60]Okay, that looks good.
[170:53.97]Sell the fin and just put it back on.
[170:56.73]Good call.
[170:57.03]Where the hell is this thing?
[171:00.59]Fin, right?
[171:04.05]Wait, this is different.
[171:05.47]Was the fin I was just supposed to use it?
[171:09.78]Wait, hold on.
[171:10.22]Jump and glide.
[171:10.90]Hmm, hold on.
[171:18.14]Wings, wings, wings.
[171:19.18]Ruined.
[171:19.52]Hold on.
[171:26.58]Yeah, let's give him these.
[171:30.39]Oh, hell yeah.
[171:45.77]You need social skills.
[171:46.97]Don't forget that.
[171:47.83]I know.
[171:55.95]This creature fucking sucks.
[171:58.33]Why?
[171:58.81]What?
[172:00.93]Why are you saying that?
[172:08.11]What's wrong with him?
[172:16.18]Ban that guy for life?
[172:18.16]No.
[172:18.32]How do you glide?
[172:26.42]Alright, let's go.
[172:37.87]Still has one leg.
[172:38.59]We have to wait to get more than one leg.
[172:41.69]They're all evolving.
[172:42.51]Okay, cool.
[172:46.87]To learn charm.
[172:55.95]That was a great image.
[172:56.99]Oh, I have a new move.
[172:59.11]Glide, jump, mating call.
[173:01.80]Learn spit.
[173:02.50]Are we just pooping?
[173:09.74]Learn charge.
[173:18.69]We all did it!
[173:21.79]Whoa, now I own this place.
[173:25.80]You should never have taught me that much that quickly.
[173:27.54]Find new parts.
[173:30.68]Alright, I'm going to go back to my friends over here and see if they've evolved.
[173:36.42]Nope, not at all.
[173:42.00]Did somebody just write Goku?
[173:44.56]You have no social skills.
[173:45.98]What?
[173:46.24]How?
[173:48.02]Yes, I do.
[173:48.46]I want to see how the little frog guys are doing.
[173:58.20]How do you glide?
[173:58.86]It's the goofiest shit I've ever seen.
[174:09.85]Have they evolved?
[174:11.57]Hi, guys.
[174:13.53]Don't be afraid.
[174:14.25]It's me.
[174:15.67]It's me.
[174:19.17]Don't be scared.
[174:19.97]I'm sorry.
[174:20.51]I'm sorry.
[174:20.83]Look, remember my singing voice?
[174:30.93]Don't be afraid.
[174:31.63]Now what?
[174:39.07]Hello, friend.
[174:39.74]You've added a creature to your pack.
[174:41.30]Oh, he's hunting, singing, or dancing around the meadow.
[174:44.48]You lead.
[174:44.98]They will follow.
[174:45.68]Cool.
[174:52.12]You added the worst partner.
[174:53.52]I didn't.
[174:54.14]I'm just talking.
[174:58.30]These people suck.
[175:00.26]You say that, how do you know?
[175:01.48]You've never even made them your friend.
[175:08.98]You have no idea what they're capable of.
[175:10.31]They might be very smart.
[175:14.71]Consume him.
[175:19.59]Hey!
[175:20.39]That was my food.
[175:23.33]Alright, let's come with me.
[175:24.17]We're going to go meet some new people.
[175:29.84]Alright.
[175:30.68]Flurgy.
[175:31.04]I don't know if I trust the people up here.
[175:34.85]I'm going to have to do all the talking.
[175:37.91]Just follow my lead.
[175:49.00]Hello.
[175:50.26]It is I. Be friends with us.
[175:59.25]Ooh, I got some wings.
[176:02.81]It's Sully and Mike.
[176:13.85]Sing?
[176:14.53]Don't be afraid of us.
[176:19.70]Holy shit.
[176:21.12]Yeah, well, it doesn't...
[176:24.30]That's not even really accurate, though.
[176:26.06]I mean, it's kind... I just... He's green and I'm blue.
[176:29.04]That's it.
[176:29.36]That's the only thing.
[176:30.96]Alright, they're now my friends.
[176:39.50]Cool.
[176:40.18]The Kroon are your allies.
[176:41.52]Nice.
[176:47.67]Shell shard.
[176:48.27]Alright, let's keep going this way.
[176:54.30]I can only have one ally?
[177:02.98]Consume Mike.
[177:03.86]Where are you going?
[177:05.93]Hey!
[177:07.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[177:08.67]What happened over here?
[177:09.67]What happened?
[177:10.11]Stop it.
[177:11.51]Stop.
[177:12.67]Stop it.
[177:13.17]Stop it.
[177:13.97]Stop.
[177:16.29]Spit on him.
[177:17.13]What happened?
[177:18.63]What the fuck happened?
[177:20.37]Why are you fighting?
[177:24.00]What did he do?
[177:25.50]I'm going to die.
[177:26.16]We got to run.
[177:27.58]Mike, follow me.
[177:28.25]Mike.
[177:29.63]Mike.
[177:32.47]I'm eating him.
[177:38.99]I don't want to die.
[177:39.77]I don't want to die.
[177:41.13]I don't want to die.
[177:41.81]I don't want to die.
[177:43.24]What happened?
[177:43.90]I don't understand.
[177:44.68]Why did they attack him?
[177:46.78]Help.
[177:47.10]Help, fellow Mike.
[177:51.44]What's his name?
[177:52.60]Help me.
[177:54.41]Help!
[177:54.67]Do something!
[177:55.84]Do something!
[177:57.56]Do something!
[178:00.84]Fight for me!
[178:01.50]Fight!
[178:01.98]Together!
[178:02.76]Oh my fucking god, he's gonna die.
[178:03.70]Is this rotten food?
[178:11.64]They're not still chasing me, right?
[178:17.56]What the hell was that all about?
[178:18.61]Why'd that just happen?
[178:24.52]Really, guys?
[178:25.10]You didn't do anything.
[178:28.04]You killed his... No, I didn't.
[178:29.82]I didn't do anything.
[178:34.26]Well, that was a fake false alliance and they killed Mike.
[178:49.21]Get over here.
[178:51.17]No, no, don't attack.
[178:52.03]What are you, crazy?
[178:56.09]What happened there?
[178:59.41]Kill them for Mike.
[179:00.45]I know, but I need a team.
[179:04.06]I'm not strong enough.
[179:05.82]I need to go evolve.
[179:13.43]I'm going to evolve.
[179:13.99]I'm going to add machine guns to my arms and we're going back there.
[179:22.78]Guys, I got to tell you, we got a big problem.
[179:26.24]Come here.
[179:30.32]We got a big problem.
[179:31.02]Alright.
[179:33.48]While we have sex, just think really hard about machine guns.
[179:41.00]It should work.
[179:46.94]Both of us at the same time.
[179:47.86]Just close your eyes and just picture, like, just machine guns.
[179:51.32]It's like knives.
[179:52.54]And, like, bombs and stuff.
[179:55.79]We'll probably be able to add it.
[180:01.03]What's this?
[180:02.19]+2 health.
[180:02.91]Ooh, okay.
[180:03.31]Give me that second leg.
[180:08.48]It's time for a second leg.
[180:10.72]Why did they start attacking him for?
[180:12.12]Why did they do that?
[180:19.86]They're all the same speed.
[180:20.62]Just get this one here.
[180:25.16]Here we go.
[180:28.16]Alright.
[180:29.18]Now I need some... I need more weapons or something.
[180:33.55]Mace ball.
[180:38.67]Strike plus one level... Okay, what do I have right now?
[180:41.17]I have bite, charge, and spit.
[180:46.50]What about hands?
[180:48.16]Pose?
[180:49.62]Strike?
[180:50.96]Strike level 2 for these grubby grabbers.
[180:58.07]Yeah.
[180:58.21]Alright.
[181:06.51]I got punches now.
[181:08.43]Very strong punches.
[181:10.53]Claws.
[181:10.91]Alright, I'm going to put these up.
[181:17.46]Yeah.
[181:18.38]There we go.
[181:21.94]Check it out again.
[181:23.32]Good.
[181:25.55]Get some new wings.
[181:26.41]Hold on.
[181:28.43]Love feet.
[181:29.85]Jump, dance, speed, and health.
[181:32.85]Charge level one.
[181:34.35]Dance.
[181:36.37]Charge level two.
[181:37.39]Speed two.
[181:43.26]Yeah.
[181:48.36]I have 71 points left.
[181:55.79]Oh shit, hooves, yeah.
[181:57.97]Make him into a centaur.
[182:00.14]Not a bad idea actually.
[182:25.00]Not a bad idea.
[182:30.81]We got 50, right?
[182:31.41]Yep.
[182:51.11]This is for Mike.
[182:54.87]He must have eaten a piece of their food or something.
[182:58.03]He's too top heavy.
[182:58.89]He's gonna fall down.
[183:02.62]He's alright.
[183:04.16]He's okay.
[183:16.50]You making a scorpion again?
[183:17.50]No, no, no, no, no.
[183:18.20]Eventually, I'm going to put his butt down, his head up, so he's a centaur.
[183:29.92]I think I'm going to sell the wings and just get hooves again.
[183:31.78]What do you think?
[183:40.78]That sounds like a good idea.
[183:55.32]Okay.
[183:55.58]Can I do it now?
[183:57.24]Oh, fuck.
[184:04.49]Now he's getting real scary.
[184:05.81]There we go.
[184:23.07]Put it down like that.
[184:25.51]Now you're in big trouble.
[184:26.33]Let's go.
[184:34.89]You making a unicorn?
[184:36.27]Kind of.
[184:38.95]You're turning him into Ludwig.
[184:44.25]My shining moon.
[184:50.09]Lose the spit.
[184:51.85]You know, the spit really is kind of terrible, isn't it?
[184:55.33]15 points for it.
[184:58.16]Just give him claws.
[185:02.04]Strike, strike.
[185:03.26]These are already the best I have, right?
[185:06.74]Never used it.
[185:07.40]Yeah, just let him fight.
[185:08.46]Health +2.
[185:17.87]Yeah, put some health on.
[185:21.92]Uh, no.
[185:22.98]No.
[185:24.10]On the shoulders.
[185:24.56]There it is.
[185:29.66]Wait, does that... Plus health.
[185:32.22]Can I do this again?
[185:34.12]Will this be more health?
[185:41.27]No.
[185:44.51]Alright, do I have enough for something else?
[185:46.15]Jump and charm.
[185:47.05]Charm.
[185:50.64]Elf and charm.
[185:52.02]Put this thing on his bum.
[186:04.29]Cool.
[186:04.57]Alright.
[186:11.27]He's turning into Jax.
[186:12.41]Well, I'm going to go kick the shit out of all those people at that nest.
[186:15.62]Sell the electric.
[186:22.40]And let's put the wings back on.
[186:30.41]Sprint and charm.
[186:31.51]Oh, yeah, he's ready.
[186:53.06]Right there.
[186:56.28]He's ready.
[186:59.12]Jermabites, ready for battle.
[187:00.48]That's right.
[187:01.18]I'm ready.
[187:01.52]Let's go.
[187:02.76]Get him a better mouth?
[187:06.80]What do I have on right now?
[187:07.62]This one is Sing 2 and then Bite 1.
[187:10.32]This is Bite 2.
[187:13.90]I get this.
[187:18.84]Oh, we're good.
[187:19.68]Alright, let's go.
[187:35.47]Where are they going?

[187:44.37]No, we just became the peak species on Earth.
[187:47.41]You can't just leave.
[187:53.78]Um, why did we hatch a mic?
[188:01.65]Your species is migrating to a new nest.
[188:03.39]Follow them to find a mate and claim a new home base.
[188:08.92]Use your mini-map to help you navigate the world.
[188:12.00]You can find your nest food and migratory path there.
[188:14.90]Okay.
[188:22.08]What is this baby doing here?

[199:36.63]Please tell me you will stream this again.
[199:37.91]That's probably what we're doing tomorrow.

[200:39.50]I'm starving to death.
[200:40.44]I need to eat food right now.
[200:56.12]Going to the ocean for bones.
[200:57.36]Alright.
[200:58.96]I'm not ever going in the ocean.
[201:00.69]Because so many of you are trying to tell me to go to the ocean.
[201:02.57]I'm never going in the ocean ever again.

[209:27.33]1924.
[209:27.43]Alright.
[209:27.97]I'm bringing.

[209:42.10]Stop flying away.
[209:47.90]Come over here.
[209:48.36]I need a new ally.
[209:56.75]I gotta pee again.
[209:57.47]Anybody else have to pee?
[210:04.89]Ants.
[210:06.64]Dance again or sing?
[210:07.52]Which one?
[210:09.80]Dance again.
[210:10.28]Alright, now be my new ally.
[210:16.04]Aha.

[210:28.48]I'll be right back.
[210:31.05]Pee time.
[214:27.96]Hello.
[214:58.82]What have we got here?
[214:59.90]What's in this bag?
[215:01.26]What's in this?
[215:01.66]I don't even know what this is.
[215:03.24]I don't know what that is.
[215:05.96]I think this might be bones in a bag.
[215:07.26]I don't know what this is.
[215:08.24]I'm going to eat it.
[215:10.94]This is a bag on my desk.
[215:11.82]I think this might be wood.
[215:16.45]I don't even care.
[215:19.31]I'm so hungry.
[215:20.05]Salted wood.
[215:20.63]I don't even care.
[215:28.95]This dude ran circles around my house.
[215:30.53]Alright, I'm good.
[215:39.70]Let's go.
[215:47.69]The first rule of improv is to say bones when you can't think of anything to say.
[215:54.45]That's a really good way to look at it.
[215:59.80]When there's nothing else to say, just say bones.
[216:02.63]I wonder how accurate that really is.
[216:05.73]I'm that person up for an hour, by the way.
[216:14.92]At least.
[216:22.36]Alright, let's go.
[216:26.97]Did we already made?
[216:27.59]We already did this.
[216:36.96]Cool Windows fan art.
[216:38.28]I don't even care about my background.
[216:41.08]Why am I speaking with a different accent?
[216:43.46]What's going on?
[216:44.91]I don't care about my background.
[216:49.05]Alright, next up.
[216:51.37]Where are these guys?
[216:53.21]Oh, they're over there.
[216:54.72]Can I do that now?
[216:58.82]Where was that species?
[217:10.12]Ooh, wait.
[217:11.28]A new group.
[217:12.62]There's three Ottos.
[217:15.68]Hello.
[217:16.78]We come in peace.
[217:19.30]Hello, Ottos.
[217:20.10]Look at that.
[217:24.57]It was so easy to make friends when you can dance.
[217:29.59]Very cool.
[217:30.07]Alright, who else?
[217:30.55]How about King Otto?
[217:38.89]I can sing?
[217:41.57]Wow.
[217:46.07]Ooh.
[217:47.75]They sneak.
[217:48.29]I can sneak now and I have better dancing.
[217:49.97]Oops.
[217:55.72]I'm sorry.
[217:56.00]It's a broken egg.
[217:56.86]It's okay.
[218:01.22]Regular speed.
[218:01.90]Okay.
[218:02.16]Who else?
[218:02.64]One more.
[218:02.94]You.
[218:03.44]How are you doing?
[218:04.04]Talk to me.
[218:08.24]I've already impressed.
[218:09.28]Who have I not impressed?
[218:10.28]You?
[218:10.42]You?
[218:13.94]Sing the Otto song.
[218:18.33]Ooh, what's going on?
[218:27.18]Evolution?
[218:27.66]Bigger brain.
[218:38.19]More brain power.
[218:38.89]Another step towards sentience.
[218:39.83]Your brain is larger.
[218:40.77]Your statue grander.
[218:42.57]Your pack now has room for two.
[218:45.69]Hmm.
[218:47.07]Any of you good?
[218:47.69]Hmm.
[218:50.27]You've got plenty of eyes, but... I think I need... See you later.

[219:01.72]Wait a minute.
[219:02.00]What's that huge thing?
[219:02.64]250 health.
[219:07.60]Uh, can I make that an ally?
[219:09.18]Can I make that an ally?
[219:12.80]What the fuck?
[219:13.60]Alright, he's stronger.
[219:15.66]He's stronger, I'm gonna help him.
[219:25.54]Hello.
[219:28.12]I like to sing too.
[219:29.10]Do you like to dance?
[219:34.66]Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me.
[219:38.46]No!
[219:41.06]No!
[219:41.82]Come on!
[219:45.56]Oh, I just made him angry.
[219:46.70]Oh, no!
[219:51.26]He's my friend.
[219:53.14]He's so powerful.
[219:54.56]He's so powerful.
[219:55.68]Oh my God.
[219:59.70]The Gronk are your allies.
[220:01.08]He's so powerful.
[220:03.15]He's got 247 health.
[220:03.61]What is this like stat screen?
[220:11.29]Is he in the party?
[220:13.29]Who's in the pack?
[220:14.09]Why is the second person in the pack?
[220:19.68]Is this the dead person on the ground?
[220:28.84]Let's do it again.
[220:36.49]He's sleeping.
[220:41.00]Come on.
[220:46.40]Come on.
[220:47.74]Come on.
[220:49.43]Come on!
[220:52.43]Yes!
[220:55.05]Alright, now I want you as an ally.
[221:04.10]He's a really good friend, but... Got him.
[221:07.96]Now I'm unstoppable.
[221:11.11]I've got a wild Gronk as a best friend.
[221:13.47]Look at his body.
[221:16.52]Look at this.
[221:19.72]That's insane looking.
[221:23.10]Now you got a tank?
[221:24.20]I do.
[221:24.56]I have a tank and a DPS.
[221:36.95]Let's just kill these motherfuckers.
[221:38.05]Let's go.
[221:46.11]What, Gronk?

[230:59.26]I'm surprised.
[231:02.62]I'm really surprised you guys want the old eyes.
[231:10.71]That's all I can do.
[231:22.52]He has personality.
[231:24.74]What, because he had eyes on his nose doesn't mean he has no personality?
[231:32.09]I learned a new move, right?
[231:34.83]Bronk just got bigger.
[231:41.01]What is this?
[231:44.43]Why does my pack have this random guy T-posing?

[234:05.02]You're getting carried.
[234:06.32]So what?

[234:13.04]Yes, I did.
[234:13.56]I almost died.
[234:14.86]I went in there and almost died.
[234:20.81]Where is his base?
[234:28.27]Go this way.
[234:32.03]He doesn't have a base.
[234:33.75]He doesn't?
[234:34.13]Okay, well, don't fuck with us.
[234:48.42]Don't fuck with us.
[234:52.25]You gotta love your 40 health.
[234:53.05]What's going on here?
[234:59.39]It was a dude he danced for some reason.

[236:07.13]Rogue Grank.
[236:09.33]Gronk 2, Grank.
[236:10.63]Wait, if we go see Gronk... Is Gronk still over there fighting?
[236:25.31]I don't see Gronk over there.
[236:26.41]Okay.
[236:34.97]Well, I'm not strong now.
[236:36.89]I have 31 health.
[236:37.65]Alright.
[236:37.95]I need to go this way.
[236:47.21]That's his son, Gronk.

[236:54.57]He's just on his own right now.
[236:55.98]Oh, right.
[236:56.56]These Reptars.
[236:57.46]These Rugrats Reptars.

[237:07.00]Come on, Grank.
[237:20.55]Free stuff.
[237:28.79]Oh, they're scared of him.
[237:32.61]Oh, good.
[237:32.91]Let them abandon the nest.
[237:33.73]We'll take it.
[237:34.17]What's he doing?
[237:42.61]You don't want to fight me.
[237:43.33]I have a Gronk.
[237:48.54]Gang up on him.
[237:49.08]We can kill the Gronk.
[237:49.96]I know we can.
[237:58.04]Now you can.
[238:06.96]I just like got smarter.
[238:09.38]I got smarter because I was watching battle and I'm becoming a tactician.
[238:16.21]Bring big strong Gronk everywhere.
[238:18.61]Never have problem.
[238:20.63]Take over every base.
[238:24.95]Your extra large brain means you can now add a third creature to your pack.
[238:29.46]Who's Gronk?
[238:32.02]Gronk?
[238:32.32]Greg?
[238:33.79]Gronk?

[238:54.18]Wiped him out.
[238:54.62]Eat.
[239:01.81]He will die without your help.
[239:05.45]He's going to be fine.
[239:09.77]You're an awful party member.
[239:13.61]I don't think so.
[239:16.01]I want to get a few more Gronks.
[239:20.33]I'm adaptable.
[239:20.96]I'm good.
[239:29.28]Alright.
[239:29.54]Let's keep going over here.
[239:32.33]Come on, Grank.
[239:32.79]We got bones.

[240:28.92]Look, we don't want to hurt you.
[240:30.92]We just want you to be part of our group.
[240:36.89]By the way, if you don't impress us, we're going to kill you.
[240:40.37]Very simple.
[240:50.97]Come on.
[240:53.29]Ta-da!
[240:54.53]Dance only.
[240:59.50]Dance again.
[240:59.94]Nice.
[241:13.43]Bronk.
[241:14.87]Really hate to tell you to do this.
[241:16.93]Oh, that was sneaky.
[241:19.89]While we were in the middle of doing our little thing, you brought over the entire crew.
[241:24.15]That was pretty smart.
[241:26.29]Although we kind of noticed halfway through there.
[241:37.55]No, they can live.
[241:42.34]Let's try to make a friend here.
[241:43.92]These guys look pretty strong.
[241:48.32]What do we got?
[241:53.42]They like to sing.
[241:58.96]More singing.
[242:06.48]That should do it, right?
[242:07.18]Hey, there we are.
[242:09.48]Let's be friends.
[242:13.48]And I want the strongest one to join my group.
[242:16.56]Which of you is the strongest?

[242:24.13]You look pretty strong, Goku.
[242:35.89]I just read it.
[242:36.71]I just, I didn't see, whatever.
[242:40.41]Let's see a couple of singing.
[242:43.57]Oh, we don't have, we don't know that move.
[242:44.90]I don't think they're going to like us.
[242:53.76]Go get charm, you fool.
[243:01.05]Give us another chance.
[243:04.40]Give us another chance.
[243:05.66]Give us another chance, please.
[243:08.84]No, you're too dangerous.
[243:10.50]No, give us another chance.
[243:15.94]Like seriously though, give us another chance.
[243:22.85]Singing.
[243:23.63]There we are.
[243:31.39]Shit, we don't know that.
[243:38.00]Come on, dance again.
[243:38.70]As a group.
[243:46.35]You need more friends to impress them.
[243:51.71]What you meant to say was... Runk.
[243:56.77]Kill.
[244:01.13]Ooh.
[244:05.58]Ooh.
[244:08.05]No, they can live.
[244:13.94]Oh, this is their base.
[244:15.28]Is this that group?
[244:16.56]Is this the group of the ones that are scared of us?
[244:18.18]No, these are different.
[244:24.70]Those are Gronks over there.
[244:25.68]Are they?
[244:25.94]No, they're not.
[244:28.50]Who's this guy?
[244:31.33]Who's this guy over here?
[244:49.86]You're sneaking over here.
[244:50.70]What did that?
[244:51.04]What do you think you're doing?
[244:53.78]You just snuck over here.
[244:54.54]You guys want to be friends?
[245:03.34]I have to be friends with the rats, right?
[245:04.66]Alright, I hope you guys like to dance.

[269:29.08]It's gonna go here.
[269:29.88]I mean, that kind... It has to be there.
[269:37.77]Hide it under the beak.
[269:45.61]Armpits?
[269:58.38]Imagine just lifting your arm up and... Alright, he's ready.

[280:25.02]I worked on offense only.
[280:36.21]Why?
[280:36.91]Because I wanted to... I don't know.
[280:39.21]I wanted to... I wanted to kill.
[280:41.37]I wanted to kill.

[284:34.89]What did you just say?
[284:36.27]Why did you just say that?
[284:44.27]I'm shocked that somebody would say that.
[284:49.70]Run him into a geyser.
[284:51.04]Here we go.
[284:53.30]Here's the Wizard of Oz.
[285:06.44]Let's go this way.
[285:11.44]Follow the yellow brick road.
[285:13.04]Follow the yellow brick road. ...
[285:24.66]Just follow the yellow brick road and we will find professors!

[285:50.65]Why did this happen?
[285:52.39]Why did this happen?
[286:03.61]Why did this happen?

[286:38.71]Here we go.
[286:40.03]Let's go in the ocean.
[287:01.81]Cool.
[287:02.25]Alright, there it is.
[287:03.81]You got to see it.
[287:04.65]You got to see the thing you wanted to see the whole time.
[287:09.05]Because you wanted the whole time.
[287:10.41]For almost five hours.
[287:18.80]How do I load?
[287:19.40]Don't save.
[287:27.77]All progress will be lost.
[287:29.13]Wait, don't save, right?
[287:29.93]Yeah.
[287:31.31]Exit the main menu, right?
[287:32.35]Let's just get out of here.
[287:34.77]That's worded weirdly.
[287:36.11]That's worded weirdly.
[287:39.86]all progress will be lost say what why are you saying that alright let's go alright here we are we're good it's time for us to progress
[288:07.22]I guess I could level up one more time.
[288:08.60]Alright, goodbye.
[288:09.38]I almost said clowns.
[288:11.48]Goodbye, clowns.
[288:14.14]You sneak.
[288:16.50]We could sneak, couldn't we?
[288:19.32]Why is the cow not sneaking?
[288:24.64]We just startled him.
[288:29.44]Just click the button.
[288:30.34]Alright, here we go.
[288:30.84]3, 2, 1, go!
[288:35.20]Your actions as a creature have earned another trait that defines your species.
[288:37.96]New unique abilities await you in the tribal stage.
[288:46.09]Adaptable.
[288:52.33]Very cool.
[288:56.93]Final stage.
[289:02.49]I'm not sure if there's anything I really need to change here.
[289:06.80]Because I already did this.
[289:10.84]We could get the final feat.
[289:13.93]But I can only do one.
[289:16.27]Sneak and dance?
[289:17.03]Far back.
[289:26.42]Far back feat.
[289:29.30]Do the final wings.
[289:30.74]Which one actually carries over and matters at all?
[289:35.20]Keep the human feet.
[289:36.48]Stats do not matter at all.
[289:38.32]None of this matters.
[289:40.74]I want better wings.
[289:42.30]I don't like these.
[289:46.18]Those are much more majestic.
[290:03.46]There we go.
[290:04.64]That's much more majestic.
[290:09.60]Only speed and weapons will carry over.
[290:11.45]Okay.
[290:15.59]Well, nothing gives me speed here.
[290:21.11]Strike five.
[290:21.89]Speed gives speed.
[290:28.52]These ones don't.
[290:32.07]Sneak, dance, and speed.
[290:34.18]Oh, yes they do.
[290:34.76]Oh, shit.
[290:39.93]I need one fucking dollar.
[291:04.30]Okay.
[291:10.79]Okay.
[291:11.49]Cool.
[291:13.65]Fuck the spit.
[291:14.55]Sell the body.
[291:16.15]Spit matters.
[291:19.01]The spit matters.
[291:20.22]Just wait a second.
[291:24.00]Don't need four legs.
[291:25.88]You know, that's true at this point.
[291:27.56]I don't need these feet anymore.
[291:33.05]So I can sell the... I can just stand up.
[291:40.59]We can go full stand up.
[291:47.55]Yeah, let's stand up.
[291:49.89]Let's go.
[291:50.27]Ooh, here he goes.
[291:56.57]Five petal.
[292:06.51]We got it.
[292:11.52]And slim him down a little.
[292:12.60]Except for down here.
[292:20.56]Thigh gap?
[292:33.25]What?
[292:33.43]Is it too big?
[292:51.37]Looks pretty good.
[292:53.51]I'm kind of happy with this.
[293:02.24]We can evolve that away and make it a tail.
[293:26.02]Make a front tail.
[293:28.28]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[293:29.10]I'll do that right now.
[293:35.17]Okay, now I have some money.
[293:36.73]What about the face?
[293:39.81]If stats don't matter, then we're looking for health.
[293:45.54]It's the highest health I have.
[293:46.44]Alright.
[293:48.94]Feet gross.
[293:49.48]Feet gross.
[293:50.04]Feet gross.
[293:50.46]Stop.
[293:53.38]Put the wings at shoulder height.
[294:16.02]Good.
[294:18.34]One wing.
[294:21.62]Health, speed, sneak, and spit are good.
[294:24.34]While I have glide, sneak five.
[294:29.60]Sing four.
[294:30.56]Five dance.
[294:37.84]Rotate the wings.
[294:40.30]There we go.
[294:44.04]Test run just to make sure.
[294:51.39]Kind of a fucked up walk.
[294:58.84]Get the better legs, I'm losing my mind.
[295:00.68]Alright, hold on, man.
[295:01.84]What do you mean the better legs?
[295:07.90]These are just speed 1.
[295:09.80]They're all speed 1.
[295:10.50]They look better.
[295:38.26]because they're like crab legs where the fuck do legs even come out from like here
[296:07.69]They actually look kind of good.
[296:08.37]So much worse.
[296:10.51]They look like melted plastic.
[296:16.45]And then you need the feet, yeah?
[296:26.66]Alright.
[296:30.64]Alright.
[296:31.92]This is a little too long.
[296:32.96]That's a little too long, don't you think?
[296:34.04]His torso is really long.
[296:46.82]ultimate being I just like squished him a little and now he's alright hold on the complete evolution is finished
[297:23.15]this looks so out of place no that looks like he's wearing a mask or something there we go and he's like a little hat or something a little a little hat
[298:05.09]No, don't like it.
[298:05.99]I somehow made him look even worse.
[298:24.46]It's the eyes.
[298:25.16]The eyes gotta change.
[298:25.86]I need to like tilt him.
[298:34.53]That's better.
[298:34.93]Okay, good.
[298:51.30]Alright, he's fucking stacked.
[298:57.90]Spine needs to be a little more aligned this way.
[299:11.16]There it is.
[299:11.50]Perfect.
[299:13.44]Test it.
[299:17.60]What about his final color scheme?
[299:26.59]Let's see what we got.
[299:36.16]Whoa.
[299:37.42]Whoa.
[299:46.31]Jeez.
[299:46.77]Okay, that's... Should I give him, like, the patches?
[299:56.86]He needs thumbs.
[299:58.92]He doesn't have thumbs?
[300:07.09]I kind of like the stuffed animal look.
[300:14.08]This is like a muscle tissue.
[300:17.44]Get thumbs.
[300:20.02]Holy shit, this is disgusting.
[300:21.46]What about this one?
[300:43.61]This one's not bad.
[300:46.97]That's kind of Jerma985 colors.
[300:48.61]I guess we can make it ourselves, right?
[301:04.09]This is a good Jerma985 base.
[301:13.33]Okay.
[301:20.83]Where's green?
[301:21.73]More green.
[301:23.37]No, more teal.
[301:24.78]Teal.
[301:26.24]Right here.

[302:58.40]It's like a light.
[302:59.18]Hold on.
[303:00.44]What does my logo look like?
[303:11.20]It's more red than pink.
[303:14.60]You're a fake fan.
[303:24.45]Oh, let me see.
[303:28.80]Hey, you know what?
[303:29.24]This has to be like a light pink and then make the green the accent.

[307:32.56]Then I'm going to save it and we'll leave.
[307:40.25]They look like a fucking toothpaste mascot.
[307:43.11]It's the exact colors of like Crest toothpaste, isn't it?
[307:47.40]Same exact color scheme.
[308:08.72]You literally ruined it.
[308:09.60]You can't change it anymore.
[308:11.80]I can't.
[308:16.43]This creature is a dumbass.
[308:17.79]Is this creature a dumbass?
[308:21.85]Yeah, sure, I guess.
[308:24.89]The beak is fucked up.
[308:28.91]They stand out so much too.

[308:55.77]You're about to enter the tribal stage Oh, I do know I do know those old-school gummy worms mm-hmm tribal stage where mine Where am I where are they oh?
[309:24.72]I spent like two and a half hours making creatures and we haven't seen any.
[309:29.52]The roof over your head and fire at your fingertips, you enter the age of hand tools and drum beats.
[309:33.82]But beware, soon rival tribes will form across the globe.
[309:37.06]Be vigilant.
[309:39.25]You now command a burgeoning tribe of three.
[309:42.71]You may select individual tribe members or a group to do your bidding.
[309:46.61]You must interact with the other tribes to move your progress bar forward.
[309:49.39]Let's take a look.
[309:51.31]This is your progress bar.

[310:05.02]Your first task is to dress your tribe in the new tribal outfitter.
[310:07.88]Click on your hut.
[310:10.78]Those guys are huge.
[310:11.86]Alright, hold on.
[310:14.30]Save it.
[310:15.10]I can't save it.
[310:15.56]I have to do this first.
[310:16.18]Okay, tribal planner.

[312:00.78]Combat and social.
[312:02.75]Social.
[312:07.65]Um, this is not going to fit anywhere.
[312:21.75]Okay.
[312:24.05]I did... I need this.
[312:25.17]How much do I have?
[312:26.79]Combat, social, or health.
[312:28.83]Gathering.

[313:42.64]A cock ring on.
[313:43.36]What?
[313:51.33]Alright, done.
[313:56.87]You can now move the camera freely around the world.
[313:58.51]This helps you check in on tribe members or groups to whom you have given orders.
[314:01.23]Let's pause for a moment and learn the basic camera controls.
[314:04.92]Look at RTS now, yeah?
[314:06.80]These controls allow you to zoom and rotate the camera.
[314:09.28]Sure.
[314:10.47]Your mouse wheel can also zoom and rotate.
[314:11.83]Let's try that.
[314:13.19]Hold left and right mouse, whatever.
[314:15.27]That rotates the camera.
[314:18.47]This is in and out.
[314:20.25]Use the arrow keys or click the right mouse button to pan the camera.
[314:24.17]Mm-hmm.
[314:25.61]Good.
[314:25.85]Click on the hut.
[314:27.99]Icon on the mini-map to focus the camera back on your tribe.
[314:32.53]Good.
[314:33.86]Click a tribe member's portrait in the tribal list to select an individual.
[314:41.39]Click and drag a box around multiple tribe members.
[314:43.66]And yeah, you can do that.
[314:44.88]Click on RTS.
[314:46.18]Let's begin to find some food.
[314:48.16]Okay.
[314:49.02]Save it.
[314:50.72]You guys said Gronk was gone?
[314:51.78]Um, no he's not.
[314:58.90]I got a rat, I got a cow, and I got a Gronk.
[315:03.43]Perfect.
[315:10.50]Alright.
[315:11.22]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[315:12.54]Start probably around the same time.
[315:13.90]So around 4.30 or so.
[315:15.30]Pacific.
[315:17.00]Thanks for watching.
[315:17.74]We'll see you tomorrow.
[315:19.80]We'll pick up right here.
[315:21.06]And do the tribe stage.
[315:22.25]And then we'll do probably the space stage, right?
[315:30.13]Sounds like a plan to me.
[315:32.67]Thanks everybody.
[315:37.72]Here come the subscriptions.
[315:40.62]All the subs today.
[315:41.34]Thank you, everybody.
[315:45.22]Appreciate you.
[315:45.86]Appreciate the continued insane support this channel gets.
[315:50.40]Like I told you a lot of times, I kind of just don't understand sometimes and I can't believe it.
[315:55.88]Thank you, though.
[315:56.26]Appreciate it.
[316:02.42]Raid.
[316:02.68]Yeah, we'll raid tonight.
[316:03.72]We'll go somewhere.
[316:05.76]Oh, and the Pikmin pull.
[316:06.62]That's a good point.
[316:07.46]Really good point.
[316:08.02]Alright.
[316:08.40]I'm going to play, after Spore, I'm going to play Pikmin.
[316:13.19]That's not as rare to find as Thousand-Year Door, apparently.
[316:18.75]So, am I going to start... What am I... I'm going to tell you the truth.
[316:24.45]I'm probably not going to play all the Pikmins.
[316:27.82]We're probably just going to do one.
[316:31.78]I don't think I'm going to... Aren't they all very, very similar?
[316:34.08]I'm probably just going to play one of them.
[316:37.90]right I don't think I want to play all three or four Pikmin games or maybe we'll I don't know we'll see which one am I starting with because if I love the one that I play I might be so engrossed I might play the other ones which one Pikmin one Pikmin two or Pikmin three is there even a was there a fourth one their fourth game
[317:08.48]No, it's just 1, 2, and 3?
[317:09.06]Alright, this is important.
[317:14.54]This is very important.
[317:15.32]I'm going to let you guys decide this.
[317:16.20]Because I really don't know if I want to do Pikmin 1, Pikmin 2, and then Pikmin 3.
[317:19.08]I feel like it's a lot of similar content.
[317:22.83]Similar game.
[317:23.29]What do you think?
[317:25.49]Because after I play Spore, and we finish that tomorrow, I'm going to play whatever one you decide for me to start with.
[317:36.75]Is he not playing Paper Mario?
[317:37.83]I am playing Paper Mario still.
[317:42.18]I just have to get it.
[317:43.56]It's a lot rarer than I thought it was going to be.
[317:47.94]You want to vote on that?
[317:48.70]There it is.
[317:57.41]He also promised Yakuza.
[317:58.71]Oh, I know.
[318:00.51]Yakuza will be coming back.
[318:05.79]Apparently Pikmin 2 is winning by a very large margin.
[318:13.80]Seems to be an unreachable margin at this point.
[318:17.93]He also promised Mega Man Legends 2.
[318:19.69]Yeah, I have promised a lot of things, you're right.
[318:28.99]He promised Rage 2?
[318:30.64]I don't think I ever did.
[318:34.83]I've never played Rage 1, but I promised Rage 2.
[318:36.83]Alright, we're going to play Pikmin 2.
[318:39.57]I'm just going to play that one.
[318:42.29]And if I love it, then I'll play the other ones, of course.
[318:45.08]Okay, what if I play it and it turns out to be one of my favorite franchises ever?
[318:48.92]Of course I'm going to want to play the other two.
[318:55.37]We'll find out.
[318:56.49]We'll see you tomorrow for more Spore.
[318:59.13]Around the same time.
[319:05.01]And let's, uh, who are we gonna raid?
[319:11.05]Raid somebody.
[319:14.21]Take a look.
[319:23.24]Um...
[319:34.98]Mmmmm.
[319:43.98]Let me see.
[320:12.56]Mr. Stark.
[320:15.36]Is he okay?
[320:26.75]I'm okay.
[320:34.33]Ray Jerry Seinfeld.
[320:42.30]Alright, we'll see you tomorrow.
[320:43.16]Go say hello to Sark.
[320:44.18]He's playing Darkwood.
[320:45.20]I scrolled through and saw people playing in Darkwood.
[320:48.02]I played Darkwood and you saw me play it.
[320:49.66]I was kind of interested in seeing how he does.
[320:51.75]See you guys tomorrow.
[320:55.75]Take care, everybody.
[320:56.75]Have a good night.
[321:36.25]Thank you.
[322:10.87]Thank you.
