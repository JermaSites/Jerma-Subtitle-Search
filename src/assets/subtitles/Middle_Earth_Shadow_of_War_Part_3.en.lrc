[00:33.68]Oh shit, I got fucking hacked.
[00:37.46]I have to imagine a lot of you guys coming in here right now that didn't see the tweet I made or are not expecting this.
[00:44.47]You gotta imagine that's your only scenario.
[00:47.43]That I got fucking, my password was compromised and somebody's streaming on my account.
[00:53.18]I haven't streamed at like 9 a.m.
[00:54.62]Eastern time.
[00:57.10]Probably in, probably like three years.
[01:02.38]I would assume.
[01:02.92]Something like that.
[01:05.12]Yes, we're going to do today.
[01:06.14]Well, today.
[01:06.98]I slept on this.
[01:09.42]And by slept, I mean rolled around for four hours.
[01:12.91]And awoke a few times.
[01:16.11]Went back to bed for an hour or two.
[01:17.71]I was kind of all over the place with sleep today.
[01:19.73]So I haven't really had the most highest quality of sleep.
[01:21.77]I slept a little bit of sleep.
[01:25.67]But...
[01:29.37]I thought about it some more, and it turns out that TwitchCon, because TwitchCon is coming up this next weekend, right?
[01:36.91]Not only am I not going to be around on Thursday this next week, and Friday, because of TwitchCon, but Tuesday, that next following week as well.
[01:45.41]Because I'm getting on a plane Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, I come back on Tuesday.
[01:53.67]So there's going to be three, like almost a full week of streams aren't going to happen.
[01:58.83]So I'm sitting here going, probably, I'm probably just going to go every day until Thursday.
[02:06.57]So I'll stream today.
[02:07.61]I'll try.
[02:08.01]I'm going to try to stream tomorrow.
[02:10.57]Maybe like another one of these early morning streams.
[02:12.57]Probably.
[02:12.88]I don't know.
[02:13.36]We'll see.
[02:15.42]We'll find out.
[02:17.24]So I'm going to try to make up for the fact that you're not going to see a lot of shit next week because of TwitchCon.
[02:23.82]What am I doing awake?
[02:24.42]I was just watching your VOD of me playing Stardew Valley.
[02:27.36]That's a long time ago.
[02:28.74]That's probably the last time I streamed at like fucking 11am.
[02:35.92]Don't force yourself to stream if you don't want to.
[02:39.10]Don't worry, I absolutely will not.
[02:42.77]I judge if I want to stream based on like two hours before the stream starts.
[02:48.55]I'll sit there and I'll go, damn.
[02:50.76]Do I want to do this?
[02:51.58]I don't know.
[02:53.43]How do I feel?
[02:55.01]Do I feel okay?
[02:58.95]You fell asleep watching a stream last night and you woke... This woke you up.
[03:02.67]That's so funny.
[03:04.50]Hey, well.
[03:06.26]Say goodnight and say good morning.
[03:08.28]Hey, good morning, man.
[03:11.86]And sometimes two hours after the stream was supposed to start.
[03:14.59]That's right.
[03:14.97]That's true.
[03:20.50]I also want to do this thing.
[03:22.34]Like a Halloween joke.
[03:25.08]But I'm gonna be barely around for Halloween.
[03:26.76]I've just been all- October's been fucking crazy for me.
[03:30.67]It's been like a really high stress month.
[03:34.39]Going back and forth to California two times in 30 days.
[03:38.27]Like it's actually kind of- Actually kind of like dogs on you a little.
[03:43.55]And the whole thing with like the fucking Warner Brothers and Machinima like- I've got a lot weighing on me in October.
[03:50.17]All the new games that have come out.
[03:52.01]All these games.
[03:54.73]One of them last night.
[03:56.05]If you caught the stream last night, obviously we're just going to hang out for a minute and talk.
[04:00.01]Let's just go like this.
[04:04.45]We don't need this here anymore.
[04:05.58]We're just going to move that.
[04:09.16]Last night we played The Evil Within 2.
[04:13.04]And I didn't think it was very good.
[04:16.22]But, you know, that's just me.
[04:20.34]So we're in Shadow of Mordor.
[04:21.72]Shadow of War, whatever.
[04:25.52]You haven't seen this game yet.
[04:27.00]You haven't seen... Oh, Shadow of War is a fucking joy.
[04:33.04]It is a present to humanity.
[04:39.81]I think this game is really, really good.
[04:42.67]But then again, I have a soft spot for orcs and weirdos and stuff.
[04:50.54]Alright, let's move over here.
[04:52.14]Is that... It is, okay.
[04:56.98]Yes, I've heard your European prayers.
[04:59.51]Yeah, I've gotten a lot of feedback about how people are saying 7pm Eastern is just too much because it ends up being like past midnight, 1am and some people just don't want to stay up and I completely get it.
[05:15.22]Trust me, I do.
[05:17.19]So sometimes I want to try to do this.
[05:19.71]I'd like to.
[05:20.25]At least attempt.
[05:25.31]When am I going to come to Europe?
[05:26.45]I want to.
[05:29.40]I would love to make like a EU trip.
[05:31.60]And just like put a backpack on and just walk around.
[05:33.76]Hey, how's your campfire story now?
[05:45.21]That guy even put his hand up to swing at me.
[05:47.93]And he lit on fire still.
[05:50.79]How can you light this place on fire when there's this much snow, man?
[05:55.47]He's still on fire?
[05:56.77]How are you still doing this?
[05:58.49]We'll take their fort and their treasures.
[06:07.16]This game.
[06:08.54]This game is just relaxing.
[06:12.96]We can do some more pit fighting stuff?
[06:14.42]Yeah.
[06:17.28]It's funny that I don't like the Evil Within 2 and I like... Let's put a skill point in.
[06:23.69]The Evil Within 2... It just... I don't know.
[06:30.07]It was trying to be too many things for me.
[06:31.99]It was trying to be like eight different video games.
[06:34.75]And all of them weren't that great.
[06:36.27]And then pushed them all together into the same game.
[06:40.04]Tack on top of that a story that I didn't really care about.
[06:44.73]And not a whole lot of scares.
[06:46.13]Nothing was really that scary.
[06:49.60]And you got a solid 5.5 out of 10 for me.
[06:51.14]I don't want to do that.
[06:53.70]Let's do... Explosive Arrow.
[06:57.14]That's kind of cool.
[06:57.94]Is this game like Skyrim?
[07:05.21]It's like a comedy Skyrim.
[07:06.69]Except it's like Batman comedy Skyrim.
[07:08.79]There you go.
[07:11.06]That's cool, you can actually freeze the AI people with that.
[07:13.61]Yeah, let's get this.
[07:17.45]I told you it wasn't scary.
[07:20.99]Yeah, but part of me also is just kind of like... I don't know, when a game describes itself as like a horror game, and all the press release stuff that they had... They had like all these trailers and all these cinematic, like, check this out, check it out, it's so fucked up!
[07:39.47]Watch all these horrible, horrifying, scary things, and it's like you walk around and craft ammo.
[07:46.55]I think, honestly, I think the open world thing was a mistake.
[07:48.87]I do.
[07:50.12]If you got rid of that open world shit, every game has to be an open world game now.
[07:55.20]Look, I say that as I play Shadow of War, which is like a fucking open world game.
[07:59.94]But for real.
[08:08.07]It was an action game.
[08:09.35]That's the thing, it wasn't even an action game.
[08:10.99]It was like... Wrong guy.
[08:17.15]I was trying to grab the... I was trying to grab... Look at how fucking cool this looks.
[08:19.65]Alright, here's another stronghold eventually I'm gonna have to raid.
[08:24.14]Oh fuck, there's a champion behind me.
[08:26.70]Although, I probably should... I probably should fight this guy and take him.
[08:30.30]Because this is a whole new zone.
[08:31.84]There he is.
[08:34.00]Is that him?
[08:34.38]It's just a guy with like...
[08:37.03]Hold on a second, is that the champion?
[08:38.71]Which one's the champion?
[08:39.75]That guy just has like a fucking white ponytail.
[08:44.60]It's this guy, okay.
[08:46.30]Wow, well, he's not gonna instantly kill me, is he?
[08:56.12]Charge it up, go.
[09:03.12]I might change the difficulty in this game, just to make it more challenging, eventually.
[09:10.36]I gotta dominate you so you can be my best friend.
[09:15.62]Remember, I don't want to get on his back.
[09:17.71]I'm gonna run him off the cliff.
[09:23.37]He's dead.
[09:27.25]Right in the background.
[09:28.25]Right in the ponytail.
[09:29.35]I got him right in the hair follicle.
[09:34.39]I'm gonna be able to... This guy still hasn't made an introduction.
[09:38.99]Where is his introduction?
[09:42.65]It's taken a long time for this guy to say anything to me.
[09:47.00]Still nothing.
[09:51.12]Usually he shouldn't be like, Ranger!
[09:57.32]Who is this guy?
[10:03.49]Still can't be dominated.
[10:05.95]Still can't be dominated.
[10:07.93]What?
[10:12.33]Hold on a minute.
[10:12.79]Did he just actually... No, he didn't.
[10:15.89]I'm gonna say.
[10:16.47]I'm sitting there collecting gems like a fucking dummy.
[10:19.29]I'm doing a lot of damage.
[10:22.30]I'm gonna go down.
[10:29.50]Really, dude?
[10:30.62]Jesus.
[10:31.26]Who the fuck is this guy?
[10:39.66]Why didn't he talk to me?
[10:40.66]Alright, well, here's a... That guy just came up and... These guys were on like a fucking expedition.
[10:46.34]Well, alright.
[10:47.04]Why'd you have to kill my blood brother?
[11:08.07]We were just playing hide-and-go-seek!
[11:10.39]He picked the fucking biggest ledge in the county!
[11:16.99]Guys, this guy sucks.
[11:20.61]For a level 23, you're a terrible... And I can't dominate him either because he's 23.
[11:26.02]I'm gonna have to Shade him.
[11:27.18]I'm gonna Shade this guy into oblivion.
[11:37.42]And then I'll dominate it.
[11:42.20]Part wrestling, part Witcher.
[11:45.16]That is such a great way to describe this game.
[11:48.27]That's perfect.
[11:50.75]I'll chain that.
[11:57.67]Now I can take him.
[12:02.51]There he goes.
[12:04.03]Although I don't have any intel on that guy.
[12:06.64]Do I?
[12:09.74]Oh, it's a secret... Wait, did I... Where is he?
[12:11.78]Over here?
[12:12.48]There he is.
[12:12.80]Alright, let's mark him because I want... This guy is underneath this warchief, so... I want this guy to be my friend.
[12:23.68]So let's go dominate him.
[12:24.62]We'll find him.
[12:25.04]Where's he at now?
[12:27.44]He didn't go very far.
[12:29.94]Where did he go?
[12:34.97]Why is he off the screen?
[12:37.74]What's the point of shaming?
[12:39.00]So when you shame somebody, you reduce their level.
[12:42.05]You cannot dominate an orc if they are above your level.
[12:45.75]So if I want to recruit that guy, he has to be my level or below.
[12:55.78]Did I sleep yet?
[12:56.90]Kind of.
[12:58.62]And by kind of, I mean not really.
[13:00.20]And by not really, I mean no.
[13:01.42]And by no, I mean yes.
[13:03.22]And by yes, I mean...
[13:06.81]I had really... You know what?
[13:07.85]I had a bad fucking dream.
[13:09.17]That's what actually happened.
[13:11.95]I had a really, really fucked up dream that I just didn't like and it just didn't sit well with me so I got up and... I don't know what the dream was.
[13:20.64]You never can remember dreams.
[13:21.64]I have no idea what it was about.
[13:26.56]Is this guy in this cave?
[13:29.12]Yeah, he is.
[13:29.52]This guy's down here playing like dice.
[13:32.30]Alright, how do I...
[13:37.25]Wait.
[13:41.53]No, I wanna- What the f- Oh my god.
[13:46.31]Alright, well I didn't sneak in here well enough, that's okay.
[13:49.71]Uh, whoops, wrong button.
[13:57.04]Oh, come on, I wanna play orc bowling.
[14:02.60]What's this, uh...
[14:04.60]There he is, gone.
[14:05.22]I was dreaming about the evil wizard too.
[14:07.58]Maybe.
[14:07.86]Yeah, they've become my friend.
[14:09.62]I think this is the new fighting pits.
[14:12.00]That's alright, come on up here.
[14:12.99]Kick him off the edge.
[14:34.46]Wow, I shouldn't have done that.
[14:40.02]Wraith move.
[14:41.72]That guy just walked by all of us.
[14:48.22]Get on him.
[14:53.24]Kargukul.
[15:03.40]You're gonna play Shadow of War while I play Shadow of War?
[15:05.42]Well, that's cool, because we're both playing Shadow of War.
[15:07.87]How much health do you have?
[15:14.87]Well, that sucked.
[15:24.47]One thing I remember from the last game that I'm not doing is, like, timing my swings.
[15:29.55]Didn't you do extra damage in Shadow of Mordor when you timed, like, tap, tap, tap?
[15:33.11]Oh, this guy.
[15:38.59]This guy has a really soft skull.
[15:43.64]Hey, good morning.
[15:45.00]If you are just joining us, this is a friendly EU stream.
[15:56.78]No, that's not what I wanted.
[15:58.08]That's what I wanted.
[15:59.22]And... break him.
[16:02.96]Come here.
[16:07.58]Go and lock that.
[16:09.18]Recruit!
[16:10.28]Alright, so make him a spy... Yeah, we'll infiltrate the Warchief on the right.
[16:27.81]Alright, well.
[16:31.29]That guy's dead.
[16:33.51]Alright, I have my first... I have my first friend.
[16:37.86]Just keep shaming him.
[16:38.88]Just shame him until he's like a level four.
[16:41.78]Shame him back into a... to be a toddler.
[16:43.70]Alright, so he's currently about to go... he's going to go spy on this guy.
[16:47.98]So this warchief has four...
[16:52.15]Like, lieutenants, I guess.
[16:54.17]So, I gotta get these two guys, too.
[16:56.19]What about this guy?
[16:57.85]Let's get three, three, two... Alright, so this guy, obviously, is the biggest threat.
[17:03.55]Considering the fact that he has four.
[17:06.90]So... What does infiltrating the Warchief do?
[17:10.06]So, if you remember in the first game... What happened to the troll?
[17:15.46]I don't know.
[17:16.32]Who knows?
[17:17.84]In the first game, they walked around in packs, and the warchief had a bunch of captains.
[17:23.60]In this game, not only can you control captains and warchiefs, but you can have them go do missions for you.
[17:32.14]And this guy in particular now is following me, and he's pretending to still follow this guy.
[17:41.85]So, it's a way for you to put the whole army together and kind of... You can... Look, I can go right now.
[17:46.21]I can attack this fortress right now.
[17:48.69]And... Not bring anybody and just get my ass kicked.
[17:51.77]I guess.
[17:53.31]You can run them on errands.
[17:54.79]It's kind of... There's a lot of just random missions you can have them do.
[17:58.39]But for the most part, you want them to be... All up in their shit.
[18:04.65]I'm not sure I'm going to unlock this later.
[18:05.83]Alright, let's go do a quest.
[18:09.01]Fuck it.
[18:10.49]First joke of the fucking morning, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:12.21]That was a full-on Jack made able to Jack be quipped.
[18:15.55]Jack jumped over the fucking fire pit.
[18:18.43]That's the kind of quality fucking early morning humor you can expect from me today.
[18:27.14]Attack the main guy right now.
[18:28.68]Do you want me to do that?
[18:30.22]I can, but it's gonna be a disaster.
[18:37.56]First joke of the stream and I missed it.
[18:39.44]Ah, it was a good one.
[18:41.61]It was a good one.
[18:42.75]Oh, what is this one?
[18:47.21]Oh, I get a skill point for doing this.
[18:50.11]Killing ghouls.
[18:50.73]Ah, let's do it.
[18:51.43]Why not?
[18:51.75]You get to play as Celebrimbor.
[18:54.54]Megras.
[18:55.92]An elven virtue celebrated by the jewelsmiths I taught during the Second Age.
[19:02.83]Okay.
[19:03.13]Finish before time runs out.
[19:04.11]Use only five arrows.
[19:12.45]Um... How the hell do you do five arrows?
[19:21.05]Oh, that's how you do five arrows.
[19:22.55]Okay.
[19:22.99]I'm sitting here, like, just spamming arrows at these guys.
[19:27.05]You're supposed to do it like this.
[19:29.39]Alright.
[19:29.73]Well... Whoops-a-daisy.
[19:33.31]I don't think I'm gonna do this now.
[19:36.04]Well!
[19:37.58]That was fun!
[19:38.28]Let's try it again!
[19:38.94]I didn't know I could hit the... I... I... The Donkey Kong barrels!
[19:41.68]Just restart it.
[19:43.70]How do I restart?
[19:44.36]Okay.
[19:47.48]So... Don... When Mario comes down here, that's how you do it.
[19:51.81]Oh.
[19:52.35]Well.
[19:53.33]They're... They're just coming up this way.
[19:54.91]I wanna, like, redo the mission.
[19:57.95]I don't think I can restart the mission.
[20:00.23]What if I die?
[20:02.57]If Celebrimfort dies in a memory, does he die in real life?
[20:11.78]Oh yeah, and I also remember when I jumped down and got swarmed by the naked fucking alien people.
[20:19.05]It was a tough game.
[20:21.63]I ended up taking at least 400 swings.
[20:27.39]And then at the last minute I died.
[20:35.23]That really sucked.
[20:37.09]That's where you found me in the first game.
[20:38.97]The ghoul ripped off my esophagus.
[20:50.64]Well, I mean, I was getting... I was taking no damage there, I'm considering, because it was like... It has to be, because of...
[21:16.80]Nooooooo!
[21:20.46]Come on!
[21:21.28]Right here.
[21:23.99]Oh, they're doing the Donkey Kong shortcut, too.
[21:26.85]Oh my god, I need one fucking more.
[21:28.33]Did I do it?
[21:29.19]That's it, right?
[21:29.67]Yeah.
[21:30.11]I'm gonna use five arrows, finish before the time runs out.
[21:35.46]And I got a gold coin.
[21:40.82]Cool.
[21:44.64]I think they just gave it to me.
[21:46.13]I think Mercy gave it to me.
[21:48.73]That's cool.
[21:52.63]Polished Jhin.
[21:53.93]What are you doing?
[21:59.67]That guy just climbed up here.
[22:00.75]He's like, I'm just going to work.
[22:03.43]Imagine being that guy.
[22:05.15]You're just going to work as an outpost.
[22:07.63]A watchman.
[22:09.41]And the guy that everybody's warning you about.
[22:11.33]The guy that could be anywhere.
[22:13.56]The fucking grave walker is just standing right there, and you're just like, fuck me, it's over.
[22:24.45]At least he didn't die like this.
[22:27.43]Okay, let's go to the actual mission.
[22:32.92]It's over there.
[22:42.52]Might as well lock it on the mini-map.
[22:44.56]So it is... There's two story missions.
[22:48.38]There's Allies and this Frozen Flame.
[22:53.54]So the last time I played that huge Balrog, it was just raining hell down and he flew away, right?
[23:04.43]Let's do it.
[23:05.11]Let's go this one.
[23:09.43]You can shoot arrows as you're falling through the air.
[23:15.43]It's something I unlocked.
[23:16.83]Yes, I can.
[23:19.35]This is far away.
[23:20.16]Give me my... Let me just call Epona for a second.
[23:30.22]I love traversing, just going up the cliffs.
[23:33.71]It's so perfect.
[23:35.33]Look, I don't even have to do anything.
[23:36.49]Look at how awesome this is.
[23:37.82]Is there a mountain in your way?
[23:40.20]It's alright, just walk up it.
[23:42.78]It doesn't matter.
[23:46.18]You just get there.
[23:47.72]You wanna go completely vertical?
[23:49.60]This game lets you do it.
[23:55.36]Well, let's... That's obviously an ambusher.
[24:04.48]Well, looks... I look... Ah, he's instantly gonna kill my Karagor.
[24:07.95]You dick.
[24:09.23]Hey!
[24:11.05]I can't even attack him.
[24:11.95]Fuck you.
[24:12.43]That was not cool.
[24:18.61]We're also going to have this guy.
[24:24.19]So here's our second captain.
[24:27.84]I did that well.
[24:28.56]You know, sometimes that's probably going to happen.
[24:31.06]It doesn't matter if you're like the best swordsman in the world.
[24:34.06]People still trip.
[24:36.68]Like Sakurai was right to put that in the game.
[24:44.89]Let's get him.
[24:45.49]Who is he connected to?
[24:47.76]I swear my allegiance.
[24:52.12]Let's just... Let's command him.
[24:57.86]So he's connected to this guy.
[24:59.06]I could make this guy my bodyguard if I wanted to.
[25:02.91]But he's way too basic for me.
[25:08.97]Kill somebody.
[25:10.17]Go thin out this guy's ranks.
[25:11.63]Go kill this guy.
[25:15.47]No, don't do that yet.
[25:21.25]You just, you just, you go do you for now.
[25:25.90]Just, just go, just, just, you can fight with me for a little while.
[25:29.34]Just hang out with me.
[25:32.02]I have to like mind control you into being my friend.
[25:35.67]That's sad.
[25:42.89]Come on.
[25:44.15]Yes, you know what?
[25:45.54]Go home.
[25:49.68]Yeah, go home.
[25:52.42]I'll deal with you later.
[25:53.14]I'm about to go do a story mission and I don't really give a shit about this guy.
[26:01.03]Oh, I missed the opportunity to do that.
[26:04.01]Let's unlock this beacon.
[26:12.05]But let me catch up on some bits here.
[26:13.58]I saw some new ones come in.
[26:21.96]Uh-huh.
[26:23.94]Thank you to James Servier.
[26:27.93]Jerms... Jerm... Jermserver.
[26:30.81]Uh, James... Thank you, James, for the 10 bucks.
[26:33.73]Jerm, thank you for the EU-friendly stream, allowing me to watch one of your livestreams.
[26:38.07]I've been waiting... wanting to watch you live, as I only watch a few of your livestreams in real time.
[26:43.72]So, are you gonna do more of these, or is this just occasional?
[26:46.06]Don't force yourself.
[26:46.92]You cannot appreciate it, nonetheless.
[26:48.22]By the way, have you seen the new Blade Runner?
[26:50.84]I have not seen the new Blade Runner.
[26:53.46]I keep hearing that it's a very good movie.
[26:57.05]But, um, thank you so much.
[27:01.21]I can't promise you that I'm going to do this all the time.
[27:04.91]Because, obviously, I'm not usually awake at, like, 8 or 9 o'clock Eastern in the morning.
[27:09.71]Just my sleep schedule.
[27:10.49]I've been, like, fighting illness nonsense for the last, like, month or two now.
[27:16.07]That I'm, like, sleep is a little weird for me.
[27:18.62]I've been going to bed, waking up, going to bed, waking up, waking up, going to bed, sleeping till, like, 7 o'clock at night, like, waking up, like... Like, there's a lot of, like, interesting... Interesting?
[27:28.10]That's not interesting.
[27:28.90]That sucks.
[27:30.74]Uh, well, it's an interesting sleep schedule, that's for sure.
[27:35.20]But I would like to try to do this more often, but I can't tell you that it's gonna be, like, a scheduled thing, because I just can't... I just don't know when it's gonna happen, you know?
[27:49.30]Hmm, where else are we going?
[27:55.67]Like, when I sleep, I sleep.
[27:56.75]Don't get me wrong.
[27:57.87]If I go to bed, I will stay asleep for at least, like, five to six hours.
[28:02.71]It's not like I'm not getting sleep.
[28:04.84]It's just erratic the times that I get tired, if that makes any sense.
[28:11.06]Alright, we got, like, two more.
[28:14.68]One more.
[28:15.10]Where is it?
[28:16.57]Down here?
[28:18.76]Kind of.
[28:23.38]Also, thank you to... Thank you, Louis, for the $1 EU stream.
[28:27.53]That's right.
[28:27.99]Thank you.
[28:29.09]UtopiaFox, thanks for the $15.
[28:32.37]Stranger, go no further.
[28:33.83]Smork.
[28:35.27]Thank you, Utopia, for the $15.
[28:37.89]Also, thank you to Jory Tomo for the $5.
[28:40.63]Hey, Jermboy, I can't express with words how much your creativity has done for me.
[28:44.75]People who aren't your fans probably couldn't understand how much we can love a random guy on the internet.
[28:50.28]But for me, you're the most entertaining person on the internet in a brilliant and smart way.
[28:55.40]I love you.
[28:55.87]I wish all the best to you and your loved ones.
[28:57.43]Well, that's incredibly fucking nice of you to say.
[29:00.51]Thank you for the $5, Jory.
[29:04.70]If you feel that way to me, thank you so much for saying that.
[29:12.96]That's... That's too kind to hear.
[29:16.72]I'm going the wrong way, aren't I?
[29:26.37]All I can do is hope, because I am just that fucking random guy.
[29:37.40]I like knowing that people are having fun.
[29:44.22]It's weird to say this.
[29:45.12]It's odd.
[29:45.34]But I take having fun really seriously.
[29:47.16]I take it dead seriously.
[29:48.46]I care more about... Look, I take having fun more seriously than serious shit in my life.
[30:08.26]You like knowing people are having fun, but not the evil within, too.
[30:13.87]I'm not going to fucking lie to you guys.
[30:16.29]We talked about this briefly last night, because a lot of you guys didn't see that stream last night.
[30:22.02]But I'm not just going to fucking pretend like I like something.
[30:25.04]I'm not going to pretend like I'm having fun.
[30:26.58]I can't.
[30:30.00]There's not a bone in my body that will allow me to do it.
[30:34.48]Is this the green bean lady again?
[30:39.54]Am I riding on this girl?
[30:44.16]Better choice of words, Jeremy.
[30:50.38]And look, that's... If you like a game and I don't, or if I have something very strongly to say about a company or an opinion or something...
[30:58.72]It's just, I can't hold back things that I say anymore.
[31:01.57]Like, I just can't.
[31:02.09]I'm like, I'm too old.
[31:03.37]I'm too old to, like... You know your crabby fucking grandfather that just says crazy shit?
[31:09.99]And you're like, wow, you know, grandpa really does, like, say a bunch of crazy shit.
[31:14.60]It's because your grandfather's old and he knows it.
[31:16.22]Like, he's already done it.
[31:17.68]He's already played the game.
[31:18.94]He's already pretended.
[31:20.66]He doesn't want to pretend anymore.
[31:21.88]Like, I'm at that stage.
[31:22.88]I'm like, I'm your grandfather.
[31:24.30]I don't want to pretend anymore.
[31:25.26]I'm just going to say shit.
[31:29.16]And the thing is, I do... It's not that somebody said no filter.
[31:31.82]No, I do have a filter.
[31:33.70]But not in regards to, like, my opinions.
[31:36.27]I don't have, like, an opinion filter.
[31:41.95]I know I'm already getting old enough to do it, so might as well just, you know, embrace it, right?
[31:45.53]Let's break this thing if I can.
[31:49.24]I can't dismount, so I can't break this.
[31:52.47]We're gonna fail all the fucking rabbit tracks.
[31:54.41]Failo- This happened.
[31:55.81]This is the no sleep words.
[31:58.20]The rabbit tracks.
[32:02.32]Since I can't hold things back, like, let's get into politics.
[32:04.74]We've already- You guys could probably determine my political leanings.
[32:09.36]If you just heard like some of the random shit that- Oh god.
[32:12.83]I gotta shoot the slag sites!
[32:13.99]No, I'm cool.
[32:21.57]I've been thinking about the political leaning.
[32:22.97]You know what I have for political leaning?
[32:25.63]I don't have a political leaning.
[32:27.71]Oh, shit.
[32:28.67]This is just a rush for blood thing all over again.
[32:31.03]I just gotta break the ceiling on the guy.
[32:43.04]I'm playing the VR game where I have to get the syringe clown away from me.
[32:55.43]How much longer?
[32:55.93]What do we got?
[32:56.61]Shoot.
[32:57.03]Slow him down.
[32:59.91]One more.
[33:00.43]Is this supposed to be hurting?
[33:04.71]Doesn't seem... Take him right into the middle of the ocean.
[33:13.43]That's right.
[33:13.93]Right into the middle of the ocean.
[33:15.01]Drop him down.
[33:18.78]How is he standing on here?
[33:20.30]He shouldn't be able to.
[33:21.10]It's gonna barely just crack under his feet, isn't it?
[33:23.48]What?
[33:23.74]How are we standing on this?
[33:28.09]Well, I have to fight the Balrog.
[33:31.45]Well, that hurts.
[33:36.89]Alright, so two hits and you're dead.
[33:38.81]Got it.
[33:40.45]Hmm, okay.
[33:40.95]Well, I can't... I had to shoot him in his back last time.
[33:49.75]Yeah, I know.
[33:53.95]It's not working.
[33:57.12]I feel like Climb is back.
[33:58.30]No, he's at the top.
[34:04.53]I don't believe in the Rensauce.
[34:06.29]What the hell?
[34:06.67]I know what I'm being for Halloween.
[34:11.31]The Balrog.
[34:24.09]Oh, yes.
[34:26.57]Ice blasts.
[34:29.79]Frost breath.
[34:32.35]Oh, cool.
[34:33.35]I get to ride on the fucking dragon from Game of Thrones.
[34:44.91]What is wrong with him?
[34:46.31]Hold?
[34:46.78]Hold what?
[34:47.62]Hold X. Oh.
[34:50.36]That's...
[34:53.45]I thought I just won.
[34:54.37]That would have been fucking funny.
[35:00.94]Is he gonna get in the air?
[35:02.20]He's running away from me.
[35:04.06]Okay.
[35:06.10]It's inverted.
[35:19.39]I don't like the camera auto-adjusting for me.
[35:21.07]Let me do that.
[35:28.71]Yeah, I think it's just gonna do it.
[35:30.79]I might as well just hold RT down.
[35:32.21]Just fucking shoot the fire hose at him.
[35:42.53]Stuff him back in.
[35:43.11]Wanna get the dragon?
[35:46.82]The dragon is the lady.
[35:48.90]The jolly green giant lady.
[35:56.95]Come on.
[35:59.69]Only has like one more hit and he's dead.
[36:09.78]And... speaking of dead.
[36:13.58]Goodbye!
[36:16.99]Quick time!
[36:31.26]It's not it.
[36:31.87]He's still alive.
[36:34.13]And by the way, what the hell hit when we hit him with an Ice Blast?
[36:36.41]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[36:39.27]Oh god.
[36:43.11]Ice Blast is zooming in too.
[36:48.42]Hit him!
[36:50.94]I don't have any Ice Blast left.
[36:56.13]How do I get more ice blast?
[36:58.85]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[36:59.73]I'm gonna lose because of this.
[37:03.24]No, don't, don't fly in the... Okay, let me just get him.
[37:09.88]Whoops, let me spin around.
[37:11.26]Hey!
[37:12.46]I just drove right into the fucking lake.
[37:19.67]It's cooling off a little.
[37:28.96]What happens when the immovable force goes up against the fucking unmistakable object?
[37:34.54]Oh, he just dies.
[37:35.24]Oh well.
[37:41.74]He's made out of fire.
[37:42.60]Isn't that like not possible?
[37:51.33]Yeah.
[37:53.37]Suddenly that lake is real deep.
[37:58.86]I almost mistook that object.
[38:06.31]Two skill points gained.
[38:07.73]Holy sheep shit.
[38:10.83]Oh no, Talion's level 23.
[38:12.47]Number 23 is everywhere.
[38:16.58]Guys, last night I streamed The Evil Within for two to three hours. 23.
[38:25.35]I went to the bathroom two or three times last night.
[38:28.13]Number 23.
[38:32.83]I had two beers.
[38:34.77]Also last night.
[38:35.95]Two!
[38:40.15]And then I drank one coffee.
[38:42.36]Three!
[38:42.70]Oh no, wait a minute.
[38:52.24]I just hit that guy fucking 14!
[38:54.42]14 times!
[38:54.72]14!
[38:54.74]Alright, enough.
[39:00.36]Let's go.
[39:00.75]It's too early.
[39:01.37]I'm too drunk tired to be able to do jokes.
[39:04.93]Oh wait, I want that guy.
[39:06.81]I want that guy and I want him now.
[39:08.07]He's number 21.
[39:08.85]Oh shit, 21!
[39:09.93]That's two more and I'll be 23!
[39:21.06]Why am I running so fast?
[39:24.96]Because I have the super move.
[39:30.22]Superman.
[39:33.93]Watch out for that fucking champion.
[39:35.75]Oh, excuse me, Ryan J- He's a vault breaker, of course he is.
[39:46.13]And his head is made out of... jello.
[39:54.30]23!
[39:54.34]Yeah, alright, I did it.
[39:56.72]You heard it, I did my fucking piece.
[40:05.01]To a 32!
[40:07.01]Holy shit, I'm 32.
[40:07.85]That's 23 backwards.
[40:11.47]Oh my god, my life is over.
[40:14.05]I'm gonna get sucked into the fucking void by the zombie lady.
[40:16.95]I hate doing that.
[40:26.52]It's a new joke.
[40:28.02]No, that's too easy.
[40:29.40]We're gonna do an easy joke, or an easy reference.
[40:37.89]What, I can't attack him from the front?
[40:42.15]Why is that, do you say?
[40:44.63]Break it.
[40:47.85]Broken, come on.
[40:52.09]Broken!
[40:57.09]Oh, you asshole.
[40:58.67]Who... Who's throwing the spear?
[41:10.39]Thank you, Lorem the Massive.
[41:14.03]Um, you can just... I can recruit him and then instantly banish him.
[41:16.75]Higher than fire.
[41:19.23]Uh, let's command him.
[41:21.75]Do I have any intel on anybody?
[41:22.99]Yeah, what level are you?
[41:26.36]21, 23.
[41:26.86]That guy's dead.
[41:32.90]Okay, I now own two of this guy's war chiefs.
[41:35.65]Or two of his captains.
[41:36.41]I can reinforce this guy.
[41:46.65]Is this guy not connected to anybody?
[41:49.83]He's kind of just a random dude, huh?
[41:54.06]Let's infiltrate them.
[41:55.26]Infiltrating is the most basic way to do it.
[42:00.28]Infiltrate the captain.
[42:01.66]Spy on the warchief.
[42:03.52]Yes, boss.
[42:05.92]Yes.
[42:09.95]You guys want me to just go do this siege right now?
[42:12.23]I don't even know what happens if you lose.
[42:15.17]Oh, this is a fresh sword.
[42:20.61]Unaware that they are not alone.
[42:24.40]Well, there's an outpost right here.
[42:25.60]Apparently there's another captain over here?
[42:29.53]Wait, is that the guy that I just recruited?
[42:31.03]Um... This is right here.
[42:40.26]I could just do it.
[42:42.00]Uh, you gonna let me in here?
[42:48.66]Well, let's unlock.
[42:51.71]Uh, ranged.
[42:57.36]So when the spiders come out, there's this last one.
[43:01.22]Instantaneously reaching enemy by aiming at them and pressing... Okay.
[43:06.39]I want this.
[43:07.07]There's so many different opportunities where this comes in handy.
[43:09.63]You can travel around so much quicker.
[43:12.29]What's the unlocks?
[43:14.25]Pull somebody to you.
[43:16.88]And give them the fucking clothesline from hell.
[43:20.38]Or... You can chain to additional enemies.
[43:26.23]Oh, that's overpowered.
[43:27.43]Look at how broken that is.
[43:28.51]Should we get the broken move or should we get more of these?
[43:38.16]Might can be double charged, enabling brutal executions.
[43:42.84]What's the last one?
[43:43.76]Time your last chance success perfectly to instantly kill the enemy target.
[43:48.19]It does not apply to captains.
[43:51.05]I still don't have anything here.
[43:55.94]Your critical strike chance increases significantly as your health hit streak is above 20.
[44:01.48]Press X as your strike lands to greatly... That's what... This is the one I was talking about.
[44:05.50]This one.
[44:05.86]Because timing your swings is actually better.
[44:17.67]I don't know.
[44:18.93]Maybe this one.
[44:20.37]No, we'll do this one.
[44:22.91]It's 23 viewers?
[44:25.42]Damn.
[44:26.94]Better be careful.
[44:29.55]Poisoning rogs.
[44:31.93]Wrath chain.
[44:34.15]What about down here?
[44:35.09]Freeze pin effects.
[44:36.41]Effects olag high and beasts.
[44:38.25]Well, that's useful.
[44:41.97]Duration is doubled.
[44:46.57]Um.
[44:48.45]What else?
[44:51.19]You can strike the ground and do a huge blast.
[44:53.17]That's awesome.
[44:55.39]Focus is consumed much slower in the air.
[44:57.43]I like this one.
[44:58.12]I want to do this one.
[45:04.18]Sticks are going to have to miss the rest of the stream.
[45:05.94]Work time.
[45:06.82]We'll catch the VOD.
[45:07.46]I shall not miss a stream VOD for any reason.
[45:09.62]P.S.
[45:10.00]Don't watch Rat Movie without me.
[45:11.46]Alright, he's gone.
[45:12.02]Let's fucking watch them all.
[45:13.21]Back to back 23 times.
[45:14.43]Take it easy, man.
[45:18.99]Have a good day at work.
[45:27.30]I can't activate that for some reason.
[45:28.68]Just fucking poison the grog.
[45:30.76]Hey guys, look, I'm spiking the punch with some fucking extra virgin olive vodka.
[45:36.02]Try it.
[45:40.96]I wonder if he'll drink it.
[45:42.08]Alright, let me hide and then we'll see if he'll drink it.
[45:48.22]I really just want some random asshole to come over and drink out of me.
[45:54.02]Somebody drink it.
[45:55.52]This guy's gonna drink it, isn't he?
[45:59.86]Come on.
[46:03.48]Somebody drink out of that.
[46:04.62]Aren't one of you guys thirsty?
[46:09.08]I guess not.
[46:10.40]Oh well.
[46:11.92]Whoops.
[46:27.17]And somehow I've managed to go the other direction.
[46:33.86]Somehow I've managed to get fir- Alright, I wanted to go here.
[46:38.30]We did that one.
[46:39.20]I wanna do this one.
[46:44.40]So we have to go over that way.
[46:47.33]Move it.
[46:49.35]I don't wanna search the outpost from the fuckin' horizon.
[46:54.09]Somehow!
[46:54.71]Yeah, like I don't know.
[46:59.95]They're just fighting.
[47:00.63]That's good.
[47:01.55]Keep at it, boys.
[47:03.68]Uh, let's get some intel.
[47:08.28]The guy with the intel is running away.
[47:12.50]Get over here.
[47:16.21]Couldn't you technically nominate me for an Emmy or an Oscar?
[47:20.25]Um... I mean, I guess... I guess you could.
[47:26.43]But no, this is not like television.
[47:28.67]Alright, here's this guy.
[47:31.70]This guy looks like a fucking scrub.
[47:37.99]What would I get nominated for?
[47:39.09]An Emmy for what?
[47:41.17]An Emmy for most times like shit his pants in like a single stream or something?
[47:49.28]Most times complained during a live stream?
[47:59.10]That was just mean.
[47:59.82]I wasn't even trying to do that.
[48:07.33]Where's my carrot boy?
[48:08.19]Give me my carrot boy.
[48:09.17]Come here, carrot.
[48:13.45]I didn't command you to do that, but, you know, gotta eat, right?
[48:18.70]Is it this way or that way?
[48:22.04]Best actor.
[48:24.54]And the best actor in a motion picture is...
[48:28.54]Jerma985 And I like fucking just start pushing people out of the way Like the cameras on me.
[48:36.08]I'm just pointing to myself relentlessly going like that's fucking right.
[48:40.68]I'm mouthing it so clearly into the camera That's fucking right Like people trying to shake my hands.
[48:47.95]I just slap their fucking hand out of the way
[48:51.81]get on the stage and I said, yeah, I want to thank somebody for this.
[48:55.79]This is a great honor.
[48:57.17]I have to thank me for this.
[48:59.61]Nobody else.
[49:04.77]In fact, this is how much I give a shit when I de-robe.
[49:08.63]I was wearing a robe.
[49:12.67]And just drop it.
[49:18.55]And then I hold the thing in the air and go, Art is dead!
[49:21.27]Art is dead!
[49:22.17]Art is dead!
[49:22.79]And I get escorted out.
[49:36.57]And I just, like, heave back and shut, put the fucking Oscar into the crowd.
[49:51.31]No art, no gold, no seed.
[49:57.74]That was really dumb, why?
[50:01.70]Why in all these stories do I rip my clothes off?
[50:05.70]We're humans, we just want to be free!
[50:07.80]You saw what happened when Adam and Eve started putting leaves on their balls.
[50:13.81]The world fucking collapsed.
[50:15.82]Adam and Eve put fucking leaves down there, and all of a sudden, like, the snake took over.
[50:26.13]They got banished from Eden.
[50:32.46]Look, putting on clothing was the reason why humanity went down the Satanic path it's gone down.
[50:38.26]It's in that book.
[50:43.04]It's in that book, the bibliography.
[50:45.30]Check it out sometime.
[50:49.70]Rescue Gondorians, okay.
[50:52.20]Can I do the jump?
[50:53.36]Let's be sneaky about this.
[50:56.54]Watch this one, ready?
[50:58.56]Dingo.
[50:59.72]Dingo.
[51:00.44]Oh, never mind.
[51:01.20]Forget about the dingo.
[51:05.88]These orcs are so dumb.
[51:11.94]Hold on, did that guy just die?
[51:13.64]No, alright, for a second I was just like... I thought that guy jumped off the cliff to die.
[51:27.87]Ow, what?
[51:29.01]Alright, fine, get out of here.
[51:33.35]Precise attacks.
[51:34.69]Ooh, baby boy.
[51:39.89]Precisely.
[51:43.85]Well, I'm doing way more damage now.
[51:48.71]Yeah!
[51:51.86]Let's go rescue the other Gondorians.
[51:55.50]This time I'm gonna do this.
[52:00.60]That's how you make an entrance.
[52:03.79]And then you poison the punch bowl.
[52:11.21]Poison no that guy's too close to that.
[52:13.38]No, don't do that.
[52:15.00]It would be a bad idea That was a horrible injury horrible entrance or perfect entrance Drink it Drink it Drink the punch Fine, I'll drink it
[52:40.61]Cut him free.
[52:40.99]That guy couldn't decide what he wanted to do.
[52:44.49]Hahaha.
[53:04.67]I love when they just don't even know.
[53:06.55]It's too good.
[53:08.65]Just standing there.
[53:09.57]That guy didn't have any AI.
[53:10.89]He was just a bag of meat.
[53:21.16]It's funny because it's orcs and they don't even matter.
[53:25.22]They're just fucking little shits.
[53:26.74]They're pretty much just walking bugs.
[53:32.15]That's how this game treats orcs.
[53:41.18]I wasn't done with you.
[53:41.92]He's dead.
[53:44.94]Caught him free.
[53:45.46]Did I die?
[53:48.48]Oh, I thought I just killed him.
[53:53.11]Reach the cave.
[53:53.69]Let's go!
[54:10.23]I was trying to brutalize him.
[54:11.29]Oh well.
[54:24.89]And that's how you style on somebody.
[54:32.56]Thank you, Oblivious Brain, for the fuck.
[54:34.82]Thank you for all the great laughs I've had.
[54:36.26]Thank you for sticking around.
[54:37.92]You cannot delay.
[54:38.70]When you find Idril, escape to the west.
[54:42.00]Why do I hate the Orcbyads?
[54:43.10]I don't.
[54:43.38]I love Orcbyads.
[54:46.64]I've already lived two lives.
[54:47.80]Thank you, cold fridge, for the bits.
[54:50.76]Don't know if I see or read these smaller donations, but thank you for inspiring me to pursue acting.
[54:55.62]I'm now on my school's improv team.
[54:58.02]Also, you fucking saved my life, man.
[55:01.25]I was suicidal a few weeks ago, and just watching you really helped me out.
[55:05.25]I'm still a little depressed, but you really made me happy.
[55:08.05]Thank you.
[55:08.37]Never change.
[55:08.93]Here you are.
[55:10.53]Well, I'm so fucking happy that you're having, like, an inspirational time.
[55:17.54]You're having, like, fun acting and shit.
[55:20.29]That's what I did when I was fucking younger.
[55:22.15]I was in plays, I was in... Like the drama clubs, I was trying to be extras in movies and stuff.
[55:28.16]Keep your fucking head up, dude.
[55:29.56]Seriously.
[55:32.32]Don't get that far down.
[55:33.40]Take care of yourself.
[55:34.08]Really, take care of yourself.
[55:37.18]Never change who I am, and never change who you are either.
[55:54.10]Just try to make your life, day by day, step by step, more... Interesting.
[56:01.94]Happier.
[56:02.30]I may have talked about this before, but honest to God, it might sound weird, it might sound like it doesn't make any sense, but it does.
[56:15.20]If you try to make yourself happy, it's actually a lot easier if you try to make somebody else happy.
[56:24.16]Because as you know, like if you have like depression or you have like anxiety or something, like you have trouble making you happy.
[56:30.41]But if you make someone else happy, you get to kind of live vicariously through them being actually happy by something that you did or said.
[56:42.33]It's true.
[56:48.67]Because you're like your own worst critic, Leia.
[56:51.65]I'm still, I still have trouble with that shit.
[56:53.73]I really do.
[56:55.79]Ow.
[57:00.47]Why would you throw a knife that way?
[57:06.72]You agree with that?
[57:07.32]You love making others happy, you just can't make yourself happy.
[57:10.04]But, remember, if you are making yourself happy...
[57:15.92]You're just kind of doing it by something else.
[57:17.74]Whether it's... Something as simple as... Something as simple as... Like, look.
[57:21.78]Something as simple... As, like, going to a restaurant and, like, tipping your waiter.
[57:29.10]You know what I mean?
[57:29.60]Like, it's... And having a conversation with the waiter.
[57:32.86]Like, that type of shit.
[57:33.84]You think about that, right?
[57:37.26]Every time I go to a restaurant... And the waiter comes over.
[57:39.90]The waitress comes over.
[57:40.90]And we have a conversation.
[57:42.76]And, like, you know, you tip them.
[57:44.13]You try to take care of them.
[57:48.29]If you're able to... It just makes you feel good about the world.
[57:54.60]We live in a really fucking strange world, guys.
[57:56.72]We do.
[57:57.14]Like, the world is fucking weird.
[57:59.14]Just our sole existence is strange.
[58:01.09]Don't you think?
[58:05.77]Tipping is not EU-friendly.
[58:11.79]You know what?
[58:12.57]I forgot I'm speaking to a predominantly EU audience.
[58:17.44]Alright, let me rephrase that.
[58:19.04]Tipping.
[58:19.74]Alright, let's take away an American thing.
[58:24.87]This is not EU-friendly.
[58:31.31]I can't confirm.
[58:31.93]I work at a restaurant, and Jerma and Kim came in.
[58:34.09]They were very friendly, but they didn't tip.
[58:36.05]Imagine if I was, like, saying all this shit, and, like, I, like, don't fucking send, like, tip a cent.
[58:43.57]Yeah, make somebody else happy by giving, like, a good, like, giving, like, somebody a tip and talk about, like, life.
[58:48.93]And I, like, don't do it.
[58:54.87]No.
[58:57.75]Oh, like, making somebody laugh.
[58:59.63]Making somebody...
[59:01.25]I'm not gonna... what?
[59:05.05]Here, I'm acting too existential.
[59:06.71]Do you think I could put my right hand on their chest so they wouldn't fall down like that?
[59:13.66]But it's okay.
[59:21.70]Let's just defeat the captain.
[59:23.20]Where's their captain?
[59:23.94]Oh, you think he's up there?
[59:26.85]Can I dominate said captain?
[59:31.29]That's a captain.
[59:32.31]No, that's not a captain.
[59:38.40]Sorry.
[59:39.12]Just startled that random guy.
[59:40.18]Oh, there he is.
[59:41.22]This guy's level 25.
[59:42.40]This might actually be a little bit harder than I thought.
[59:47.02]But...
[60:01.52]Long story short.
[60:03.30]That hurt.
[60:07.54]Everybody knows what makes... Here's like the psychological thing, right?
[60:12.94]I know what makes me upset.
[60:14.78]I know what makes me really, actually fucking unhappy.
[60:17.20]I do.
[60:18.40]We all do.
[60:19.14]Very deeply.
[60:20.56]In our very soul, we all know what makes us unhappy.
[60:24.42]You don't necessarily know that about people you talk to on a daily basis.
[60:28.31]You don't really know what makes somebody really unhappy.
[60:31.39]They could tell you maybe, but they might not be telling you the truth.
[60:35.23]But we're very vocal about what makes us happy.
[60:41.39]I can tell you right now some things very specifically that make me very happy.
[60:45.22]So people knowing that...
[60:48.38]It's much easier to... It's easier to make somebody happy than to make them sad, I think.
[60:53.51]Like other people in your life.
[60:55.73]Because you don't really know the things that make them unhappy.
[60:58.17]I can't... I don't remember my health shot.
[61:01.89]This guy's kind of just doing all the work for me.
[61:03.73]So I don't really care.
[61:06.71]Ow, my head.
[61:07.69]Yeah, just get Mr. Freeze, dickhead.
[61:18.95]Did he turn into a psychology lesson?
[61:20.67]Sweet.
[61:22.91]He's too powerful to recruit.
[61:25.98]Shame.
[61:34.34]I'm happy when you're unhappy.
[61:36.42]He became deranged.
[61:39.01]Oh, that's not good.
[61:41.53]Oh no, what if you get happiness from somebody being unhappy?
[61:44.91]That's a conundrum.
[61:47.19]I'm not the one to explain that one.
[61:51.39]I thought we were done for.
[61:53.03]My family thanks you, Ranger.
[61:55.54]You're very welcome.
[61:56.32]Rescue the final Gondorian.
[62:00.46]I feel like that's a Star Wars title.
[62:03.38]Star Wars Episode IX.
[62:05.01]The final Gondorian.
[62:08.93]I'm in your deck.
[62:11.73]What if you're naturally a cynical and sarcastic person?
[62:18.02]Don't you think I am?
[62:19.42]I find myself to be pretty cynical.
[62:25.89]My cynicism reached, like, a peak last night.
[62:29.83]So, you can be cynical, but still, you know, want to make people happy.
[62:41.31]I'm not cynical.
[62:42.79]I think I have cynical tendencies.
[62:44.83]I think I do.
[62:45.27]You haven't seen much of this game.
[62:49.07]What just happened?
[62:49.57]He wasn't powerful enough.
[62:50.51]So if you're just catching it, you're not sure.
[62:53.91]If the orc is higher level than me, I cannot recruit them.
[62:58.66]I have to shame them.
[63:00.02]I have to lower their level.
[63:00.92]That's how you do it.
[63:02.02]You shame them.
[63:04.32]And then next time I see him, I'm able to control him.
[63:08.50]Speaking of stuff.
[63:11.12]Let's... I want to... Let's go to the orc menu.
[63:22.05]Who do we got?
[63:22.55]Who's the guy that I just... This guy.
[63:28.07]Where's this guy?
[63:31.31]I could draw this guy out.
[63:32.25]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[63:34.69]By detonating his grog stacks...
[63:37.98]I'm going to go after this Warchief.
[63:39.52]Because I got an inside man here.
[63:42.56]Yeah, I got an inside man.
[63:43.88]It's time to go take out this Warchief.
[63:46.42]And have him be my Warchief.
[63:52.87]It's right over there.
[63:53.47]Might as well give it a shot.
[63:59.81]It's currently 10 o'clock in the morning for me.
[64:08.65]Yeah, that guy has a fucking interesting name.
[64:13.47]Firewater.
[64:18.10]Draw out Douche the Alchemist by detonating his Grog stacks.
[64:24.20]And defeating the Warchief.
[64:25.76]Do I have any intel on him?
[64:26.78]I do.
[64:28.60]Heavily damaged by beasts.
[64:30.95]Becomes temporarily dazed when his rage wears off.
[64:35.69]And we're gonna do, we're going to, we're gonna up the difficulty of the game.
[64:47.73]I'm gonna make the game a little bit harder.
[64:51.34]Because why not?
[64:53.20]What are we on right now?
[64:53.98]Normal.
[64:55.74]Nemesis, put your skills to the test and experience the full breadth of the nemesis system.
[64:59.22]Orcs are smarter and more adaptive, requiring careful consideration of each enemy's weakness.
[65:02.78]Death is guaranteed.
[65:06.73]I still have to... I gotta take some photos.
[65:12.76]So... It doesn't necessarily make the game harder.
[65:16.14]I think it just makes more mechanics.
[65:17.66]It adds... So you gotta be a little bit more tactical in your approaches.
[65:25.62]We'll see how it goes.
[65:26.58]I think you take more damage.
[65:27.84]You don't deal as much damage.
[65:29.08]We'll see.
[65:30.24]Pin enemies with my bow, detonate grog stacks.
[65:32.50]Alright.
[65:33.25]Let's get in there.
[65:37.30]I didn't play on the hardest difficulty from the start?
[65:43.75]No.
[65:44.49]Not this time.
[65:46.55]But that doesn't mean I do have to play a little bit more intelligently.
[65:51.11]And so by intelligent me, let's just get right in this guy's face.
[65:58.63]If I don't get a guaranteed death, I want a refund.
[66:03.41]Turning off counter alerts makes the game hard, too.
[66:05.47]Yeah, but that makes it... That makes it, like, too hard.
[66:08.27]One grog stack.
[66:19.98]Two grog stacks.
[66:23.04]And can I get a third one from up here?
[66:24.80]Yes, I can.
[66:25.64]Another grog stack.
[66:26.74]Ah, pin enemies with my bow.
[66:28.34]Whatever.
[66:30.08]There's the Warchief.
[66:31.12]He's gonna have a couple of friends...
[66:33.98]One of them is going to be mine.
[66:34.98]What are all those sticks called?
[66:38.40]The hot sticks?
[66:41.18]Don't attack immediately.
[66:42.52]Oh, God.
[66:44.46]Okay, this guy went in hard.
[66:46.16]Oh, God.
[66:48.76]He's far away.
[66:53.20]You went too prematurely.
[66:57.16]Prematurely, dude.
[66:59.41]So you're the source of all this mayhem in Mordor.
[67:04.10]I am the alchemist, and it's my job to bottle all that fuel.
[67:10.02]You will fuel the Dark Lord's army, though you may have to die first.
[67:16.64]How do we take you down?
[67:17.80]How you can throw your flesh off your bones with my bare hands?
[67:23.61]You may not talk too much.
[67:27.75]he actually that's awesome I did not expect that he's arrow proof alright my one random level 18. now let's get a combo here but you didn't want to do oh it's just you I hope there'll be enough left of you to go
[67:50.02]Oh, this is Horza.
[67:50.72]This is the guy I was looking for.
[67:51.90]I only have one guy, and he's over there fighting random shippies.
[67:56.58]Shitties!
[67:58.34]Alright, we're on, like, super difficulty right now.
[68:03.97]First of all, you gotta get out of here.
[68:07.65]Let's bring in my fucking friends.
[68:10.67]And my Karagor.
[68:11.33]Let's make a little bit of an equalization here, guys.
[68:19.93]There's too many people, there's too many people in the mosh pit.
[68:22.43]Oh god dammit.
[68:24.11]That's why you don't bring your dog to a rock concert.
[68:26.91]Oh fu- What the fuck?
[68:30.87]Oh god, I'm gonna die.
[68:33.26]No, I can't die right here, come on.
[68:35.10]Recruit!
[68:37.24]What is exploding?
[68:47.38]That's new.
[68:51.70]Can I jump over him?
[68:52.42]I can jump over that guy.
[68:53.32]Wow, who is blowing shit up?
[68:58.43]Which one of you is doing that?
[69:01.13]You need to stop it.
[69:02.23]This is why you don't bring fireworks.
[69:05.10]You know what I was going to say.
[69:12.65]It's that guy over there.
[69:13.91]It's my guy doing that, I think.
[69:16.09]He's gonna die.
[69:18.69]Don't do it.
[69:19.55]Stay alive.
[69:20.33]What's that guy's name?
[69:21.03]I don't even know.
[69:21.51]Who cares?
[69:22.00]He's fucking replaceable.
[69:25.52]When in doubt.
[69:30.82]Who is killing me?
[69:32.68]Oh no, a guy with a bow.
[69:37.41]Alright, get me up there.
[69:38.21]Woohoohoo!
[69:40.35]Oh, I'm poisoned.
[69:41.77]Is that guy still up there?
[69:43.23]I'm not gonna die from this, right?
[69:44.41]Get up there and eat that guy's brain.
[69:46.01]Whatever you do.
[69:46.51]How do I, what do I do?
[69:49.33]Alright, I gotta drop down here.
[69:50.51]That guy's bleeding out.
[69:51.85]Oh no, I'm gonna lose one of my fucking friends.
[69:55.02]Okay.
[69:58.56]No, I wanna drain this guy.
[70:01.06]Drain him!
[70:02.84]Before the whole crew gets here, drain him!
[70:05.85]Oh my god.
[70:07.73]I just wanted to drain him.
[70:10.17]I wanted to drain him.
[70:11.84]I... I... You wouldn't let me do it.
[70:16.16]I was just jumping from fucking building to building.
[70:18.76]I wanted to hold B on that guy.
[70:21.76]And I just hop around and go, this way, jump right out, jump to that building, jump over to that building.
[70:24.95]Oh my fucking god.
[70:28.47]Yeah, Lucky Shot is more like it.
[70:29.85]Seriously.
[70:35.01]Death is guaranteed.
[70:35.89]Yeah, it wouldn't have been guaranteed if the game didn't automatically jump your character across buildings.
[70:40.30]I only have one friend now.
[70:46.38]This guy's level 30.
[70:46.94]Oh, fuck me.
[70:54.48]Who's still alive?
[70:56.27]Do I have a guy that's still alive?
[71:04.44]That bothered me with the first game, too.
[71:09.92]They don't bring buildings to a rock concert, guys.
[71:20.72]Does the fortress and army represent the entire scope of the game?
[71:23.61]I just threw that at someone.
[71:27.69]Who am I throwing this at?
[71:30.05]Is the fortress...
[71:32.76]Does this fortress and army represent the entire scope of the game?
[71:35.16]Is taking this fortress the premise of the game?
[71:38.38]I mean, it's kind of... It's like 50-50.
[71:41.36]It's a lot of building your army and fortress stuff.
[71:45.78]That's also where a lot of the microtransactions come into play.
[71:49.39]Because you can raid people's... You can take a bunch of orcs and raid somebody's fortress online, like Clash of Clans.
[71:57.31]So, you can just play through this game and not really worry about all that shit.
[72:00.21]You can just kind of go through the game.
[72:02.43]I have heard... I have heard that this game does get really grindy near the end and encourages buying loot boxes to, like, beat the game.
[72:13.78]And that's sad if that's true.
[72:15.80]I really hope it's not, but... Climb up and... Climb up... The one time I want you to fucking actually freak out and climb on shit, you don't want to do it.
[72:34.48]Yeah, it kind of does remind me of the Phantom Pain.
[72:37.80]Collecting orcs.
[72:39.92]Where is... I cannot fight that guy again.
[72:46.21]I have to go get some orcs.
[72:47.77]We're going to do some orc recruiting.
[72:51.05]Let's get some intel, let's find an orc that's worth taking, and let's go take him.
[72:54.36]And then we're going to build up... I need at least like two or three orc friends before I go do that, especially on Nemesis.
[73:06.07]Can you dive- Never Trust Purple, thank you for the five bucks and you say, Can you dive repeatedly to random dudes who just graduated Orc High School?
[73:17.10]So there's like 500 captains running around.
[73:19.18]I want a WWE intro around every fucking corner.
[73:25.12]I don't know, actually.
[73:28.02]Yeah.
[73:28.56]The guy that shot me graduated from Orc High School.
[73:30.60]He did.
[73:32.66]So let me... What is this?
[73:36.76]Treasure hunt.
[73:39.26]Draw out the Warchief by stealing his treasure.
[73:41.20]No, I'm not ready for that.
[73:43.76]Not even close.
[73:45.01]We need a series of orc friends.
[73:47.57]Those guys are like level 30 now.
[73:50.07]Oh, I fucked myself in the face.
[73:52.31]I really did.
[73:53.43]In a very, very, very large amount of ways.
[73:55.37]Stop hurting this cat!
[73:58.69]Come here!
[73:59.01]That's how we protect the animals in my neighborhood.
[74:05.81]I need a worm.
[74:06.39]Let's just unlock this.
[74:16.55]Literally his first day with a bow he gets a kill.
[74:18.56]That's the thing with orcs.
[74:19.58]If you just accidentally beat somebody... They fight each other too.
[74:23.44]I think I'm gonna advance time here.
[74:26.82]We're gonna skip this.
[74:33.79]I don't really want to do this at the moment.
[74:35.85]I'd rather go looking.
[74:38.23]Let's see.
[74:43.10]I thought this guy died.
[74:45.18]Where is this guy?
[74:49.56]Wasn't that guy bleeding to death somewhere?
[74:55.32]Yeah, he was?
[74:56.08]Yeah.
[74:58.40]Because I can't really do anything.
[75:00.95]Come in.
[75:05.85]Okay, let's just, um... Let's make this guy my bodyguard.
[75:13.23]He must have stopped bleeding.
[75:17.63]No, that's good.
[75:19.39]You know, maybe it's because I died.
[75:20.35]I just lost, um... There's a worm over there.
[75:23.33]Let's get some intel and build an army.
[75:26.27]Alright, don't... You stay there.
[75:33.80]Don't attack anything.
[75:37.06]These guys up top or are they around the corner?
[75:40.26]They're over here.
[75:41.40]Oh shit, I gotta go!
[75:49.46]Hello.
[75:51.28]Can you please tell me what you know about the secret?
[75:58.34]Okay, I know about you.
[75:59.34]Those are your three guys.
[76:05.37]These two are currently about to fight.
[76:07.31]Oh, shit.
[76:07.63]These guys are about to be in a situation here.
[76:10.19]What about you?
[76:17.05]Oak Book Steward of the Keep.
[76:28.38]Let's reveal intel on everybody here.
[76:37.19]As many as we can get.
[76:42.23]Could do the Warchiefs too.
[76:43.35]Yeah, let's just figure out who they are.
[76:48.11]Cough the Red.
[76:56.17]And you as well.
[76:57.33]Where are you?
[76:58.61]He's running.
[77:02.65]Well, I wasn't actually chasing you.
[77:04.36]You just made that up.
[77:10.10]Too late.
[77:15.78]And let's reveal Intel on you.
[77:20.07]Let's just get some dudes out here.
[77:21.25]Where are all the big guys?
[77:26.69]I want a couple of huge dudes.
[77:28.15]I don't want these.
[77:30.33]Although one of my guys is about to be in a problem, right?
[77:32.95]Let's see.
[77:34.84]Okay.
[77:34.94]Okay.
[77:38.68]This is, okay, here's Harzr, this is, okay, I wanna, I wanna get this guy.
[77:43.27]That guy was part of the warchief's crew.
[77:48.01]Let's go take this guy out.
[77:50.79]I just scared that guy.
[77:59.85]I jump-scared that guy.
[78:01.57]That was so... Oh fuck, don't fuck this up.
[78:04.63]I keep forgetting I changed the difficulty.
[78:07.36]I changed the difficulty.
[78:08.30]This is no longer like an easy game.
[78:15.00]Huge dudes with huge... dot dot dot.
[78:25.87]What's up, dude?
[78:30.46]I already jumped.
[78:34.55]I already jumped.
[78:38.25]Not sure you see that or not.
[78:43.31]All I care about is dominating this guy's brain.
[78:49.66]Try to isolate him.
[78:54.52]Ow.
[78:54.84]Come on.
[78:59.21]Hey, sorry.
[79:00.01]I was just wondering.
[79:00.83]Am I in the right game?
[79:03.17]Fucking adapt.
[79:05.47]That's not good.
[79:13.42]Ah, I wanted to charge it up twice.
[79:17.08]Alright, we gotta thin some of these guys out.
[79:28.15]Go from person to person here.
[79:32.57]Did I not unlock that move yet?
[79:34.68]I guess I didn't.
[79:35.50]Have I not blocked it?
[79:41.86]What about you?
[79:43.96]Are you arrow-proof or something?
[79:49.17]You're not.
[80:00.39]Bump him into the other Ninja Turtles, that works better.
[80:07.61]And this is where we bring all of them.
[80:10.74]Three, two, one, action!
[80:12.96]I have no elf shot, shit!
[80:17.44]Oh, goddammit.
[80:19.04]That's unfortunate.
[80:25.28]He's adapted, I forgot, shit.
[80:27.52]Oh god, not good.
[80:28.38]I haven't had such an opportunity there.
[80:35.01]Let's get these fucking huge ogres.
[80:38.56]Oh, I need elf shot right now.
[80:40.22]There's no way I can fight all these guys at the same time.
[80:43.86]This is not gonna happen.
[80:49.89]How the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[80:53.13]Nobody can be attacked from the front.
[80:54.43]Nobody can be attacked from behind.
[80:55.59]Ow.
[80:55.65]Alright, let's get some tactical advantage here.
[81:03.72]Look at the elf shop that's down here.
[81:11.00]Hmm, same thing.
[81:11.76]Run around.
[81:12.26]Bring around the Rosie.
[81:14.34]Alright, bring the whole entire train over here.
[81:19.48]Oh, that hurt.
[81:27.05]That hit me too.
[81:27.77]It's alright.
[81:28.19]Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
[81:30.05]He's almost done.
[81:36.53]Dominate!
[81:37.75]Dominate!
[81:38.93]You're mine!
[81:40.78]Fuck off!
[81:42.78]I've got it!
[81:47.32]Recruit.
[81:52.06]Alright, uh, spy on the Warchief.
[81:57.76]Really?
[81:59.34]Come on now.
[82:05.77]Okay.
[82:06.79]Sorry, there's too many like versions of people here.
[82:08.69]There's a guy I can't hit from behind.
[82:10.09]Like I said, there's two guys that I can't swing at the front.
[82:12.81]What is it gonna leave?
[82:14.48]So, I got him.
[82:17.26]Now, let's see who else.
[82:18.32]What is over here?
[82:20.12]Vendetta.
[82:21.32]This guy... Oh, this... Okay, this is the fucking asshole.
[82:27.70]The lucky guy that shot me.
[82:30.91]He's literally standing over here apparently.
[82:35.64]Where is he at?
[82:38.02]Lucky shot.
[82:39.80]Get revenge.
[82:40.54]He was eating trash.
[82:43.11]Search the outpost.
[82:44.39]He's in here somewhere.
[82:45.23]There he is.
[82:45.51]Is that a 25?
[82:45.77]Wow.
[83:02.09]25.
[83:02.13]That guy shot one arrow and gained fucking like 16 levels.
[83:08.98]What an EXP leech.
[83:15.14]He was in a party that killed Ragnaros, and he was level 1.
[83:20.37]He just got carried.
[83:24.63]I want to climb up the logs, man.
[83:31.19]I'm gonna get intel on him.
[83:33.71]And the way to do that is like this.
[83:38.93]What are you doing?
[83:39.77]Oh, why are there two of you?
[83:40.97]Oh, my lord.
[83:47.16]Okay, where is Henry Luckyshot?
[83:50.34]Right here.
[83:51.06]No, that's Grom.
[83:53.58]Where is he?
[83:58.08]There he is.
[84:00.15]Intel.
[84:01.21]Heavily damaged by stealth.
[84:04.57]And he's damaged by ranged executions and explosions.
[84:07.53]So this guy, I need to stealth kill him, but he's surrounded by a bunch of people.
[84:13.71]So he has a pack of Karagors, that's who's currently following me.
[84:17.27]He's a beast master.
[84:19.75]He's also enraged by stealth, that makes it real fun.
[84:30.48]I'll give you a minute.
[84:31.16]You were currently dominating that guy's brain.
[84:33.58]I'll give you a second.
[84:41.54]Up on the top.
[84:44.64]I don't want to interrupt your conversation you were having.
[84:52.77]How am I going to do this?
[84:55.59]Alright, I know what to do.
[84:57.47]Bring in my friends, bring in my Karagor.
[85:01.10]I can't, there's no room for them to go.
[85:02.58]Knock him down.
[85:05.00]Summon!
[85:06.46]Bring in, just fucking fill this place!
[85:09.54]It's a brawl!
[85:16.31]Where are my friends?
[85:17.49]Dominate that Karagor!
[85:20.52]Somebody just dropped a grenade.
[85:23.53]That was not the smartest thing to do.
[85:29.77]Another grenade.
[85:34.05]Why would I be fighting these guys in this fucking bell tower?
[85:41.55]Get up.
[85:42.78]Get up in the air.
[85:44.46]It really is the Royal Rumble.
[85:48.18]I gotta fucking eliminate somebody.
[85:52.13]No, shit, wait, that's my own guy.
[85:53.53]Fuck.
[85:54.21]Oh, he got knocked off.
[85:59.91]Oh, here comes the first elimination.
[86:02.41]Fucking throw him out.
[86:06.01]That's so much easier than fighting.
[86:15.66]Look at how many eliminations I've gotten so far.
[86:19.95]Okay, stop fucking around.
[86:21.81]Stop fucking around.
[86:22.45]I'm almost dead.
[86:25.39]There's no rhyme or reason to this.
[86:26.85]I have no button prompts.
[86:32.14]Who else?
[86:32.54]Is this Karagor still alive up here?
[86:35.28]Who else?
[86:35.74]Get rid of you.
[86:37.10]Get review.
[86:38.56]Get rid of you.
[86:39.64]Alright, now it's just him, right?
[86:40.88]No.
[86:42.80]Three more Karagors came up here.
[86:45.04]What the fuck?
[86:46.42]Why?
[86:46.88]Oh my fucking god.
[86:52.02]Is my guy alive?
[86:54.56]Not for long.
[86:55.86]Oh, shit.
[86:57.82]Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[87:06.72]Somebody's currently falling.
[87:11.21]Somebody fell out of the bell tower.
[87:14.31]Hold on.
[87:14.69]Did you see that?
[87:15.71]Somebody fucking fell down.
[87:18.93]Oh, God.
[87:21.14]Getting beat by Lucky Shot and his 12 Karagors.
[87:29.10]This is fucking bullshit.
[87:30.72]Alright, eat somebody.
[87:38.15]He didn't just... Back up the tower.
[87:44.41]This one's dead.
[87:47.47]It's just carnage, man.
[87:48.59]I fucking love this game.
[87:51.36]Yeah, there's a rare item in here.
[87:54.94]You're practicing too?
[87:56.52]Good, good for you.
[87:57.36]Alright, back down.
[88:03.83]Oh my god.
[88:05.21]Fucking all of this is sacred.
[88:07.57]Do I have to break these bolts?
[88:10.83]Alright, just... Yeah, good thing I collected those coins.
[88:17.14]Fight.
[88:17.54]No, don't fight.
[88:18.96]Now he's not even selectable.
[88:29.28]Where's the fucking captain?
[88:32.87]I don't have any elf shot left.
[88:34.77]What is in a fucking staring match?
[88:40.35]He's down here.
[88:41.05]Is he climbing up?
[88:43.85]Where am I stealth killing?
[88:47.42]This guy alright good he's done This Glue Man coming I don't want this guy as a friend.
[89:00.58]I have this guy's dying.
[89:01.58]Oh My god, please don't please don't die from lucky shot again and What a goofball
[89:14.43]Oh, this is such goofy shit.
[89:16.28]I have no more elf shot and he's over there broken.
[89:18.58]Alright, I got help.
[89:27.20]Just give random intel on somebody.
[89:28.84]Who cares?
[89:29.24]I'm this unclean guy with his golden Minecraft sword.
[89:36.67]Alright, he's fighting for me now.
[89:40.87]There he is.
[89:45.24]No, not the fat guy.
[89:48.37]We have to clear this.
[89:49.33]I gotta clear this out.
[89:50.25]That's the only way it's gonna work.
[89:52.41]No, it... God.
[90:01.30]Damn it!
[90:03.20]Give me his brain!
[90:04.10]What happened?
[90:06.16]I got it.
[90:09.00]He's too powerful to recruit.
[90:20.22]Down to 20.
[90:22.52]Chase is now available.
[90:23.72]Fuck.
[90:24.38]We're good.
[90:29.51]Alright.

[90:43.82]Alright, let me take a look at the screen again.
[90:45.12]We got... I want to, like, go to the fighting pits.
[90:51.42]Where are the fighting pits here?
[90:57.67]Douche the Alchemist is hosting a feast to celebrate your defeat.
[91:01.75]Really.
[91:05.99]Kuga the Prowler is raiding Nakra the Unclean's supply cache.
[91:10.91]Okay.
[91:11.03]Where are those fighting pits?
[91:18.42]We can chase him down here.
[91:23.29]Shame him back to high school.
[91:26.75]Yeah, I think we gotta crash the feast here.
[91:28.29]Okay, who's connected?
[91:34.62]Who is connected to who?
[91:35.58]Alright, one of my guys is still... Okay, one of my guys is an inside man.

[91:44.43]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[91:45.36]We're going to go do that Knocker the Unclean raid.
[91:50.64]Dominate him.
[91:51.54]Get him on our side and then we'll go dominate.
[91:53.34]No, that's... What level are these guys?
[91:58.02]23 to 19 and 21.
[92:02.39]If I bring my bodyguard with me... Well, the bodyguard died, so I need a new one.
[92:11.32]He's no longer a spy for this guy.
[92:13.98]But that's alright.
[92:15.14]I need this guy as my bodyguard.
[92:16.34]I have to bring somebody.
[92:22.22]So there's my new bodyguard.
[92:24.54]Let's go interrupt this beast.
[92:31.34]I picked up a lot of items too.
[92:32.76]We'll interrupt the feats.
[92:33.58]Hopefully... We'll interrupt the feats and then hopefully we'll get the cutscene to win.
[92:41.68]I think can I fast travel to a better spot yeah alright you're celebrating my defeat well we're going to be celebrating yours very soon it's that easy
[93:13.07]Don't do the feast.

[93:19.27]Just gonna sneak in the back door.
[93:20.69]Alright, where are they at?
[93:29.51]I think they're gonna be down here.
[93:30.63]Okay.
[93:39.51]Let's do it.
[93:40.99]Get revenge on the douche.
[93:43.44]He's at the outpost.
[93:46.17]Where is he at?
[93:48.65]Up there somewhere.
[93:51.37]Alright, let's be tactical about this.
[93:55.59]Let's sneak in here.
[93:57.70]Get some kills.
[93:58.44]No alarm bells.
[93:59.44]No nonsense.
[94:03.84]Let's actually get this done in an appropriate manner.
[94:17.30]It's alright, we're fine.
[94:21.24]He's gonna take out the people at the front door.
[94:22.86]That's how every mission starts.
[94:26.16]You always have to kill, like, the Five Guys at the front door.
[94:28.44]It's alright.
[94:35.14]Now we're in the outpost.
[94:37.86]Bloop.
[94:42.15]Where was that guy going?
[94:44.13]I don't think any of us will ever know.
[94:46.19]Okay, there he is.
[94:51.55]There's douche.
[94:53.47]Damaged by beast, he gets exhausted.
[94:58.37]Don't tell me the douche is gonna be my...
[95:02.33]What are you doing?
[95:03.61]Why is he already fighting?
[95:05.63]I didn't tell him to do that.
[95:07.64]Oh my god, we were supposed to be tactical about this.
[95:09.74]Bring in the bodyguard.
[95:11.12]Oh, your bodyguards will be here in a minute.
[95:15.04]Just in time to bury your corpse.
[95:16.70]And I'm getting ambushed right now.
[95:21.43]Well, it's another fucking brawl.
[95:24.51]Oh, you are?
[95:25.79]Thinking to take us all on?
[95:27.65]Give you lots of bother, we will.
[95:29.31]Huh?
[95:32.05]Okay, well, we get to have another fucking shit show.
[95:37.87]Oh my god, give me a break, dude.
[95:40.18]This feast, I've ruined the whole party.
[95:50.95]I gotta take them out one by one.
[95:55.01]Oh, they're all gonna have an intro now.
[96:06.07]It was all because my guy decided to heal me.
[96:11.81]Good.
[96:12.07]Be a magician.
[96:12.63]That's fine.
[96:16.69]Everybody I dominate is fighting in this fight.
[96:19.07]I'm converting them and they're all fighting.
[96:22.10]This guy's 19, he'll make a very, very good ally.
[96:24.80]Oh shit, somebody just pressed the fucking button.
[96:35.13]I gotta get away, I gotta get away from this guy.
[96:41.11]Oh, he's retreating, good.
[96:45.97]The guy that's retreating is the guy I gotta go after.
[96:49.03]And then I'm bringing him back into the fight.
[96:59.75]He just did a fucking magician move.
[97:02.13]Of course he's gonna do like the I'm a ninja, I'm gonna fly away thing.
[97:04.95]Alright, good.
[97:06.65]We got him.
[97:11.33]We got... Where'd he go?
[97:22.48]Get over here!
[97:23.98]You fight for me.
[97:28.70]Rick Root.
[97:29.89]And stay and fight with me.
[97:36.29]Stay and fight.
[97:38.19]Alright, let's go back to the feast.
[97:44.54]You, uh, you as well.
[97:50.24]Fuck this guy up.
[97:51.58]Take him out one by one.
[97:55.23]Yeah, of course I go execute the Karagor.
[97:57.41]That was fucking beautiful.
[98:00.83]Okay, missed.
[98:09.26]I'm still waiting.
[98:10.84]Well, was that my guy?
[98:11.94]It was.
[98:12.24]That was a nice fucking area denial.
[98:15.48]Break him.
[98:16.22]And recruit him.
[98:24.54]He's immune to executions, that's fine.
[98:27.42]Get the fuck over here.
[98:28.92]You're mine.
[98:29.64]Ah, dick.
[98:32.25]Oh, you double dick.
[98:34.97]I gotta take on the Ratlord.
[98:45.73]Level 23.
[98:46.27]Bring him in again.
[98:48.15]Stay.
[98:48.47]Stay and fight.
[98:49.65]Don't spy on the Warchief.
[98:50.76]He's currently here.
[98:51.58]He'll know our plan.
[98:53.48]Alright.
[98:56.24]Somebody's still throwing grenades in here.
[98:57.82]Oh, shit.
[99:00.08]No.
[99:01.14]No, come here.
[99:03.18]Stay alive.
[99:04.30]How do I revive you?
[99:05.00]Like that.
[99:08.04]Oh!
[99:09.15]I think that guy's gonna have to just die.
[99:10.33]Oh, fuck.
[99:16.64]Time.
[99:17.56]Carnage, right?
[99:18.22]Gotta cause carnage.
[99:20.88]I just killed two of my guys.
[99:25.10]Come back to life!
[99:27.44]Oh, they're all fucking dead.
[99:28.88]I just dropped a nuke on this whole fucking team.
[99:31.68]No, not him!
[99:33.01]Oh, no!
[99:35.09]No!
[99:35.79]No!
[99:37.83]No!
[99:40.59]I'm gonna tell everyone about how I killed you.
[99:43.61]Of course, they probably won't believe me.
[99:46.52]So, I reckon I'll smack him with your severed arm.
[99:51.53]Dude, nemesis isn't... Playing on nemesis, you have like a tenth of a second to make that work.
[99:57.15]That was gonna work too.
[100:02.41]But blame it on the guy that was inside there, that was at the feast, that just started attacking the whole fucking crowd.
[100:10.12]I was gonna go in there tactically.
[100:21.45]I didn't deserve this.
[100:23.07]The one guy that got in an argument about fucking bread.
[100:29.98]My guys are such shitties.
[100:31.22]At least I got a couple more.
[100:36.26]Like, who are you connected to?
[100:37.32]There's one guy that he's connected to still.
[100:39.68]You know what?
[100:40.04]You... You...
[100:46.93]Go fucking ambush this guy.
[100:53.79]Send Loram the Massive to ambush the enemy captain's nemesis mission.
[100:57.67]Yes.
[100:58.45]Go get him.
[101:02.21]Recruit all of his bodyguards separately.
[101:03.77]I mean, I... Look, we were trying to go for, like, difficulty.
[101:07.88]We were trying.
[101:11.44]Now he's gonna kill him.
[101:15.89]21 versus 25.
[101:16.23]I'm going to go help him on that mission.
[101:18.85]And we're going to go steal that guy.
[101:23.35]This game is fucking so much fun.
[101:24.59]No, I don't want to do that mission start point.
[101:32.43]Where's this one?
[101:34.98]Where's the one I just sent him on, right?
[101:36.30]I mean, I could do that.
[101:43.71]I guess he's just gonna do it on his own.
[101:49.15]I only have, like, one worthwhile person.
[101:54.85]I'm standing right here.
[101:55.87]Let's just, let's do this one.
[101:58.57]Just get this one done right.
[102:03.85]Oh, Jesus.
[102:07.47]Never trust a purple.
[102:08.77]Just gave $100.
[102:09.09]What does your message say for the $100 message?
[102:15.43]$100 joke.
[102:17.17]The $100 rat joke.
[102:20.43]This is just... Alright, I almost had it.
[102:24.98]That wasn't it.
[102:25.92]I promise that wasn't it.
[102:27.88]I just, like, hit the wrong button.
[102:29.80]Why am I doing this to this poor guy?
[102:31.48]Let me unlock some moves.
[102:34.96]Anyways, Never Trust Purple.
[102:36.64]10,000 bits.
[102:37.30]100 fucking bucks.
[102:40.27]And he says, this is what happens when you try and take on the rat lord, jermaRat.
[102:45.82]Was that guy a rat lord?
[102:46.62]Am I just not paying attention?
[102:50.38]But thank you, dude.
[102:51.64]You gave a lot more money earlier.
[102:53.36]Let's go back and look at some other bits while I have a second here.
[102:57.15]Thank you so much.
[102:59.79]And you just gave $5 again?
[103:01.13]The $100 joke is you go kill the rat lord, dude, right now.
[103:05.93]Let me just get some friends first.
[103:07.81]Let me just take, like, a crew in there.
[103:09.71]He's level 30.
[103:10.51]He's almost... He's six levels higher than me.
[103:13.13]And I'm playing on Nemesis.
[103:14.57]So I can't just go in there.
[103:15.81]I'm gonna lose.
[103:18.45]But thank you for the $105 so far.
[103:21.03]You gave more earlier.
[103:23.09]Uh, Vale.
[103:23.73]Thank you, Vale, for the $1.
[103:25.03]Did I say pooing?
[103:28.01]Right now.
[103:28.77]I can't do it right now.
[103:30.55]I don't have any friends.
[103:33.74]Oh, it's the guy riding the Karagor.
[103:34.90]Alright, I'll go kill him.
[103:35.74]Bye.
[103:38.14]Wow, but thank you.
[103:39.74]Why did I read that message?
[103:41.91]Uh, Schlabaza, thanks for the two bucks.
[103:44.75]Streamer misses bits from start of stream.
[103:46.73]Exposed.
[103:48.17]Oh, shit.
[103:48.92]Sorry.
[103:51.20]I have, like, sometimes I look over and I just, I lose track.
[103:54.54]So I'm really sorry if I missed some from earlier.
[103:56.66]But I want to say thanks for all the laughs and giving me entertainment tonight on my birthday.
[104:00.46]Very grateful.
[104:01.72]From New Zealand.
[104:02.54]Currently 3.20 a.m.
[104:04.36]The future sucks.
[104:06.38]B-Day 100.
[104:07.34]Well, shalabuza or shalabaza.
[104:10.40]Thanks for the $2 and happy birthday.
[104:13.24]All the way in the future in New Zealand.
[104:15.03]That's crazy to me that you are almost a full day in the future.
[104:20.37]You're an entire day almost thinking, if something ever happens.
[104:24.97]Like, can you tell me what the lottery ticket numbers are?
[104:27.92]Is that how that works?
[104:30.58]Like, do our text messages go through a wormhole?
[104:34.68]For that to be a possibility?
[104:37.38]Anyways, thanks dude.
[104:39.90]Never Trust Purple again with $10.
[104:43.81]Killing Jerma is an automatic plus 20 to that guy's timer.
[104:46.55]He now has 1712 to beat Kane and Lynch too.
[104:54.39]Fuck.
[104:57.87]And you gave $5.
[104:58.79]You've given like $140 so far today.
[105:04.61]Jesus, man.
[105:05.47]Thank you.
[105:09.49]Purple, you are on fire right now.
[105:11.64]You are.
[105:14.50]I got a skill point.
[105:15.10]Let's use it on...
[105:20.31]I need this execution drain.
[105:24.69]It's going to help me out a thousand times.
[105:26.15]Let's go on the inventory too.
[105:27.25]Let's take a look.
[105:31.90]Yeah, it's just better.
[105:33.66]This is legendary.
[105:34.52]Yeah, I'm going to use it.
[105:38.86]I'm not going to destroy that though.
[105:42.63]Ten critical hits and I can upgrade it.
[105:44.85]Okay.
[105:47.03]Okay.
[105:51.06]I'll just break these down.
[105:56.23]I'll hold on to that.
[105:58.27]Can I upgrade anything?
[105:59.09]10 crits will have happened in no time, so that's good.
[106:04.31]Alright.
[106:04.91]Where's Ratman?
[106:09.13]Okay.
[106:09.75]Tugog the Ratlord.
[106:16.32]Do I have intel on him?
[106:19.07]I don't.
[106:19.35]Let's get some intel on the Ratlord and go kill him.
[106:26.61]Let's go get a worm.
[106:27.29]Hi, guys.
[106:35.87]It's pronounced Shlaboza.
[106:38.61]But thank you.
[106:39.13]Here's more money.
[106:39.81]Well, thank you, Shlaboza, for the $1.
[106:41.41]So let's get intel on him.
[106:45.37]I'm not going to death threat this guy.
[106:46.75]I'm not bringing him to level 30.
[106:51.01]Heavily damaged by executions.
[106:52.41]He's flammable, and he's scared of beasts.
[106:54.59]They hurt him.
[106:56.71]He's pretty standard.
[106:58.07]So, let's get him.
[106:59.17]What else?
[106:59.37]What does he do here?
[107:01.11]He gets enraged by mortal wounds.
[107:04.79]He has explosive shot.
[107:06.12]Final blast.
[107:10.32]He lewds... He's got a gang of ologs.
[107:12.98]Okay, that's interesting to think about.
[107:15.30]Be careful there.
[107:16.82]He has bombs and shit.
[107:17.90]This guy's just a pain in the ass.
[107:21.51]The guy riding the Karagor is scared of Karagors.
[107:25.35]Well, at least you're facing your fears, dude.
[107:28.31]I do commend that.
[107:29.57]Alright, let's go get him.
[107:31.67]And recruit him.
[107:33.95]Far away, is he?
[107:36.04]Let's see.
[107:38.74]Kid fast travel to... No, let's just walk.
[107:42.20]Let's walk.
[107:48.43]And by walk I mean, for some reason, we're fighting everybody.
[107:51.43]That's cool.
[107:57.29]Ay!
[108:05.84]When I see the execute button I have to do it.
[108:07.84]And there's a mission right here.
[108:10.84]No- we've gotta go kill the rat man.
[108:15.84]Bring in only worms.
[108:20.84]No.
[108:25.19]What is this?
[108:26.13]Oh.
[108:27.07]Somebody's dirty laundry.
[108:31.63]Yeah, I see an execute button I push.
[108:33.09]What is this?
[108:33.43]Outpost leader?
[108:34.01]No, this is like a war chief mission.
[108:35.25]Yeah.
[108:45.39]I tried to use the zipline and he jumped off.
[108:47.59]Come on, dude.
[108:54.24]Let's get in here.
[109:00.08]Glad to see me up this early?
[109:01.34]Well, I'm glad to be here.
[109:02.50]What are you doing?
[109:04.36]Lucky shot.
[109:10.37]He's now legendary?
[109:12.17]Oh, okay.
[109:25.20]I have to get my revenge here.
[109:26.30]I have to recruit him and take him on the mission with me.
[109:29.22]Don't make that much noise so we don't startle the whole camp.
[109:31.58]And we already did.
[109:32.36]I can kill this guy.
[109:40.25]Don't you fucking dare set off that alarm.
[109:46.21]Ah, fuck.
[109:55.18]No, no, no, not one of the big guys.
[109:57.98]Get out of here.
[110:00.96]I need to recruit my lucky shot because he's been so good.
[110:03.48]Oh, he just killed... He just hit his own guy.
[110:12.53]Come on.
[110:14.00]No, the alarm.
[110:15.54]The alarm.
[110:18.02]Fuck me.
[110:18.60]Get away from me.
[110:20.80]I don't want this dumb ninja turtle here.
[110:23.16]I'm so close.
[110:28.60]Just get in the mosh pit and start swinging.
[110:39.87]There it is.
[110:41.87]Finally!
[110:42.27]My revenge!
[110:45.30]Ah, no!
[110:46.40]Get away!
[110:46.82]No, you little shits!
[110:51.10]I gotta build up the execution meter and then I can do it.
[110:53.86]He's running away.
[110:55.28]Don't let that guy get away.
[110:58.20]He's hiding in between people.
[110:59.82]Just give me the execution meter.
[111:01.04]Go!
[111:02.36]Make sure I get out of the right person!
[111:04.96]That wasn't the right person!
[111:07.00]No, don't kill him!
[111:09.20]Oh, you assholes!
[111:11.99]Why do you have to be here?
[111:13.43]Why do you have to be here?
[111:14.53]This stupid huge guy.
[111:19.11]Oh my fucking god.
[111:25.31]This is it.
[111:26.85]There's no way I'm going to be able to do this.
[111:28.07]I have to run the fuck away.
[111:30.78]Well, you're the dumbest motherfucker I've ever seen in my life.
[111:33.82]He ran closer to me.
[111:41.30]I can't recruit him.
[111:42.04]I'm fucking level 24.
[111:43.49]Fuck this.
[111:47.63]Fucking kill this asshole.
[111:52.31]Not today.
[111:55.83]He's cutting his fucking face open.
[111:58.90]Die!
[112:07.39]He's death defying too, isn't he?
[112:10.92]Of course he is.
[112:13.24]Of course he's death defying.
[112:18.76]You are not coming back from that.
[112:21.56]Nemesis system or not, you don't come back from that.
[112:24.07]And I got a legendary.
[112:30.03]They're gonna have to do some Frankenstein shit to piece you back together, man.
[112:38.00]I do forget sometimes that it's like zombies in a Resident Evil game.
[112:41.27]If you don't take the head off, they come back.
[112:43.93]I don't have... I need to, like, lose all these guys before I do this.
[112:59.49]Unless... Isn't this not... Okay, it'll be fine.
[113:04.08]Alright, Tugog the Ratlord is raiding Snafu Nightbringer's supply cache.
[113:08.24]I have no stake in this fight.
[113:12.55]So, let's start it.
[113:18.31]Save the Ratlord.
[113:18.95]Well, I'm gonna dominate.
[113:19.99]Okay, I can dominate him.
[113:29.35]Wait, was this capture or kill?
[113:31.69]What?
[113:31.85]Oh, I sent... I forgot I sent my guy to ambush him.
[113:33.55]Oh, God.
[113:33.87]Oh, my God.
[113:35.50]Oh, fuck.
[113:59.80]What the fuck is going on?
[114:03.06]Well, this is capture, right?
[114:05.10]I'm just gonna capture this guy.
[114:06.69]He'll be mine soon enough, dude.
[114:24.98]I'll get him.
[114:33.09]No, not one of these big guys.
[114:35.89]He's enraged.
[114:36.87]God damn it.
[114:39.53]I have to wait till he's not enraged.
[114:45.93]I don't want to lose another guy.
[114:50.43]Yeah, you're enraged.
[114:51.63]I get it.
[114:52.01]Cool.
[114:56.46]He's gonna end up dying.
[114:57.38]Someone's gonna accidentally kill him.
[114:58.56]Alright, he's broken again.
[115:07.75]Damn it!
[115:09.17]Who's killed the fucking big guy?
[115:11.97]Don't accidentally kill him.
[115:13.23]No, no, no!
[115:14.29]No!
[115:14.81]Don't you do it!
[115:15.63]Don't do it!
[115:16.75]Don't do it, please!
[115:18.13]I need him!
[115:19.84]I need the Rat King!
[115:21.48]Give me him!
[115:22.16]It's not yours!
[115:23.46]Fuck!
[115:25.24]No, get him!
[115:26.50]Who did this to me?
[115:27.60]No, not another shit bomb!
[115:30.34]Okay.
[115:31.24]Wait, wait, wait, where is he?
[115:37.19]Who?
[115:38.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[115:40.07]Do something, dude!
[115:41.95]Do something!
[115:43.84]Why?
[115:44.44]God damn it.
[115:45.68]Here comes an explosion.
[115:47.58]Who are you?
[115:48.12]What is going on?
[115:52.76]DOG!
[116:02.31]In what scenario can I actually dominate that guy?
[116:06.13]This is just fucking explosions every two seconds.
[116:13.12]And I couldn't build up a combo to be able to dominate his brain.
[116:16.54]And the dominate takes like a full five seconds to happen.
[116:24.39]It's like, you can't dominate him.
[116:27.77]I wanted to dominate him.
[116:28.79]I didn't want to kill him.
[116:29.75]My guy that I brought in was standing there looking at me like I had my fucking thumb up my ass.
[116:37.02]And you can't, I can't grab him either.
[116:44.39]Combo him to dominate him?
[116:45.63]Did you see how much health he had?
[116:48.33]If I swung one time at that guy, it would have killed him.
[116:51.91]God fucking damn it.
[116:56.79]Aug.
[116:57.19]Hi, Aug.
[116:58.37]Yeah, this is like a different Aug.
[117:13.54]I had other guys to swing at.
[117:14.62]Yeah, not when I'm getting like carpet bombed.
[117:20.58]I was legitimately getting carpet bombed at the end there.
[117:24.38]Where am I supposed to go?
[117:26.90]I'm gonna like climb up a building.
[117:33.27]Fucking nemesis difficulty.
[117:36.09]I'm staying on.
[117:37.59]Alright.
[117:38.13]Where's that fucking rat fuck?
[117:40.19]Where is he?
[117:40.67]He's dead.
[117:57.02]Okay, I guess he died.
[117:58.16]I don't remember.
[118:07.65]Oh, this time it's like... Oh my gosh, I'm like level 19, too.
[118:12.71]This is not good.
[118:13.63]I'm gonna go do another story mission.
[118:21.06]See, that guy also died.
[118:23.69]He also died from the missile that somebody dropped on the group.
[118:28.84]Let's go to a mission.
[118:34.90]Oh, that's... I love it.
[118:36.58]Okay, I'm gonna go over here.
[118:41.79]Fight pits is what I wanted.
[118:44.79]We cannot save everyone, Talion.
[118:47.31]Idril may already be dead.
[118:50.38]I'm sitting here complaining and being like, oh, what the fuck?
[118:53.36]It's unbelievable.
[118:54.20]I tried to get up.
[118:55.08]He's just lying on the ground.
[118:56.26]He's dead.
[118:58.86]So, mission accomplished.
[119:03.60]What the fuck is that?
[119:04.30]Is that a grog?
[119:08.14]It's an ice grog.
[119:14.68]I'm gonna dominate the ice grog and I'm taking him over to the fighting pits.
[119:27.77]That's so cool.
[119:28.51]At least if I can do these moves.
[119:29.61]This is like a rare spawn.
[119:32.89]Why are you coming over here to get me?
[119:34.92]I will never understand your logic here.
[119:39.52]The huge ice demon is currently attacking us all, and you guys would rather swing it at me.
[119:47.66]It's broken.
[119:48.06]Let's get it.
[119:48.68]There we go.
[119:54.26]So I get ice breath?
[119:56.70]Elemental attacks.
[119:57.66]Hold LT and RT to spray your enemies.
[120:02.07]Oh, yes.
[120:02.87]LT and RB to hurl a boulder.
[120:06.36]And you can do an elemental blast.
[120:09.26]Let's try it.
[120:18.01]Oh, that's effective.
[120:19.43]Can I just smash them?
[120:26.43]Kind of.
[120:27.53]This is so cool.
[120:30.99]Alright, the blood support.
[120:35.18]Bro Boulder, right?
[120:39.88]That's how you throw a boulder.
[120:44.85]The boulders got so much faster in this game than the last one.
[120:48.39]They had a lot of travel time in that last game.
[120:50.43]Let's give it... I need to climb up something.
[120:57.50]That is so cool.
[120:59.06]Alright, is there like a feature of the GTA in this game where I can store this guy in my garage?
[121:09.92]Because I don't want to lose him.
[121:13.33]He's much faster than the other one, it seems.
[121:18.11]I can't park this guy in the safe house.
[121:19.57]Fuck, he sits over that way.
[121:31.66]It sounds like he's making that noise.
[121:38.52]Just summon one eventually.
[121:39.56]Alright, so it's down there.
[121:46.43]Wow.
[121:48.31]Lots of noise.
[121:49.03]I'm not being stealthy with this one.
[121:54.75]Fighting pits.
[121:55.35]I'm going to lose him here.
[121:57.88]This is unfortunate.
[122:04.04]Oh, shit.
[122:06.14]What?
[122:08.10]There's a dog on my face.
[122:09.22]What?
[122:09.64]Oh, I thought that was something else.
[122:14.23]It's alright.
[122:14.69]I can freeze him.
[122:15.39]He doesn't have Frost Breath.
[122:19.65]Is he dead?
[122:21.81]How did you die that quick?
[122:24.91]Alright, get me into the mission.
[122:27.02]Fighting pits.
[122:32.28]Investigate the fight pits.
[122:33.70]Here we go.
[122:35.58]This is why you all came here.
[122:43.68]Defeat the Caragor.
[122:46.60]New enemy, Dire Caragors.
[122:49.24]Stronger and tougher than regular Caragors, these rare beasts are usually accompanied by loyal Caragors that fight by their side.
[122:54.00]Do we just have to fight this thing?
[123:03.44]Are they dominatable or no?
[123:06.12]That was easy.
[123:08.13]Now we have to fight a bunch of orcs in a row.
[123:11.80]Defeat the ologs.
[123:12.78]Alright, let's... Oh, you killed my bestie.
[123:23.33]Huh?
[123:24.03]Did I... I just got distracted.
[123:34.23]I thought it was a captain coming to get me.
[123:36.63]It was one of my captains.
[123:38.46]Except her entrance was really not anything to write home about.
[123:43.31]How come I didn't zoom in on her?
[123:45.01]And have her say a bunch of crazy shit.
[123:49.59]Oh shit, a Karagor.
[124:05.04]I do like that you can actually... That ground execution thing... ...is so much better if you can have Caliburn Boar do it for you.
[124:13.63]So you don't have to worry about anything.
[124:15.65]How many more people?
[124:16.25]Are they all going to drop down eventually?
[124:20.33]Him being able to actually block an attack is so much better.
[124:25.25]Here comes Captain.
[124:33.38]Let's get the guys behind him in a line.
[124:34.82]No, we don't just get in there.
[124:41.45]If I can dominate him and keep him here, I will.
[124:43.15]Before I, like, send him away.
[124:45.73]He seems like kind of a default captain, though.
[124:47.36]I don't think this guy can be... I don't think he can do anything with him.
[125:00.03]And tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[125:04.39]Shit, I didn't even see that on my screen.
[125:08.87]Did you just hit me in the back?
[125:14.45]Shag the Bloodpike is dead.
[125:20.03]He came into the ground.
[125:24.27]Why am I streaming so early?
[125:25.21]I just decided to do an EU-friendly stream.
[125:30.27]Because I was having some sleep troubles.
[125:32.23]I haven't really been to bed for that long.
[125:35.85]And I felt like playing Shadow of War.
[125:37.85]So I just decided to turn the stream on and hang out.
[125:42.04]I don't know how long this dream is going to be, but I wanted to play it for at least a little while.
[125:47.07]I wanted to at least do some more fighting pit stuff, because that's the most fun for me.
[125:52.79]When am I going to play Evil Within?
[125:56.91]I played it last night.
[125:57.83]We'll speak of this later.
[126:00.23]We'll just leave it at that.
[126:01.19]I will not be protected any longer.
[126:13.43]Not by you.
[126:16.89]Not by anyone.
[126:17.29]Stream until it becomes NA friendly.
[126:21.12]Probably not that much longer at this point.
[126:24.74]Saturday.
[126:25.74]Then that is my fate.
[126:26.92]It's like 11 o'clock in the morning.
[126:29.54]But I'm staying.
[126:34.70]Go.
[126:35.34]Here we are.
[126:36.50]Go.
[126:36.78]Reinforcements will be here soon.
[126:40.85]We will meet again.
[126:48.13]Okay.
[126:51.19]Did I level up?
[126:51.89]No, it's okay.
[126:54.27]Access to the fighting pits.
[126:58.52]Or do I have access to the fighting pits?
[127:00.36]Huh.
[127:10.07]I guess I didn't unlock the fighting pits.
[127:14.49]This is my Saturday morning cartoon.
[127:17.17]I'm glad to be a cartoon for you.
[127:26.01]Maybe I can't do it right now.
[127:28.27]For some reason.
[127:34.81]Now I can actually do this.
[127:42.15]No fighting pits though here.
[127:43.31]Why?
[127:48.05]I have to take over the fort.
[127:49.65]Okay.
[127:51.83]So let's do that.
[127:53.93]Let's get that underway.
[127:55.55]What does this look like?
[128:01.77]This guy doesn't have any bodyguards anymore.
[128:06.26]He honestly doesn't.
[128:13.14]These guys can't be...
[128:19.34]I'm going to have him infiltrate this guy.
[128:23.92]Confirm it.
[128:25.00]Infiltrate him.
[128:27.56]New nemesis mission created.
[128:28.84]He has to fight in the fighting pits.
[128:33.04]To be able to be a... Okay, let's do that.
[128:36.42]See if this guy can do it.
[128:41.48]Alright.
[128:42.85]Prove your worth.
[128:45.95]Get into the fighting pit.
[128:48.43]Where's the thing to start the mission?
[128:54.17]Uh, what?
[128:55.57]Am I missing something here?
[128:56.51]Uh, start the mission.
[129:02.19]What the fuck?
[129:03.92]Can he just not do it?
[129:07.90]I'm confused.
[129:21.62]Do I need to go all the way to the top of the mountain?
[129:26.78]No.
[129:27.39]Holy shit, I actually do.
[129:28.59]That's annoying.
[129:29.25]I figured I could just do it from in here.
[129:37.99]That's not the fighting bit.
[129:39.17]Give me my Karagor back.
[129:48.66]Off we go.
[129:52.42]I can't get up that way.
[129:55.80]Shit!
[129:56.20]I need you to infiltrate.
[130:00.27]I'm not doing a siege right now.
[130:06.74]I need to deal with these warchiefs.
[130:14.42]Karagor... I want that Karagor so I can do this easier.
[130:18.02]They're gonna kill the Karagor before I can even get him.
[130:24.55]Love it or not, bye!
[130:27.29]See ya!
[130:40.38]Don't forget I have to recruit the giant rat.
[130:42.38]I promise I will try.
[130:45.56]I would have just killed them last time, but they couldn't do that.
[130:56.69]Alright.
[130:57.57]Now.
[130:59.43]Where is this fighting pit that I can stand on to... Okay.
[131:08.40]I don't think I can do this.
[131:12.50]You guys said I had to climb up the mountain.
[131:14.10]No, I just I don't think it's available.
[131:16.07]What the fuck is it?
[131:18.67]What?
[131:20.77]It looked like I could do that.
[131:21.73]It was like on the map, wasn't it?
[131:23.03]Right in here.
[131:40.45]Why do I have to be standing here?
[131:42.17]Is this a weird place to do it?
[131:47.21]Alright.
[131:50.91]Unknown captain, I don't know who it is, but he's level 23.
[131:53.25]Hopefully he does well in the pit.
[131:58.24]Oh shit, it's a huge guy, isn't it?
[131:59.52]It is.
[132:01.00]He's level 18, he sucks.
[132:09.79]Go get him.
[132:11.67]Go get him.
[132:12.17]Yeah.
[132:14.53]Begin.
[132:21.11]Really?
[132:22.71]That was embarrassing.
[132:25.47]Go fight him.
[132:26.71]Why are you standing there?
[132:27.95]Fight him.
[132:28.61]Fight him.
[132:29.79]Fight him.
[132:33.13]Shoot him with your bow.
[132:35.87]The thing... Just point blank explosive arrowed him.
[132:43.13]And now things are going fine.
[132:45.21]We're going well.
[132:46.94]Although it's not going to go so well.
[132:48.68]This guy's going to let him just die, isn't he?
[132:52.00]Cock the arrow.
[132:54.42]Cock the arrow.
[132:56.32]And shoot him.
[132:57.50]You missed.
[132:58.56]No, he didn't.
[132:59.30]What?! !
[133:02.13]He just phantom arrowed him.
[133:06.59]He shot a piercing phantom arrow through the guy's brain.
[133:16.58]Well, uh, okay.
[133:21.72]Nice work.
[133:22.32]You did it.
[133:23.48]I now have an infiltrated man.
[133:29.14]We're going to do another infiltration here.
[133:33.15]Do I have anybody that he doesn't know?
[133:36.02]Okay, Kuga the Prowler.
[133:37.30]Alright, the Prowler.
[133:41.76]You get in there, you infiltrate.
[133:46.06]Prove your worth in the fighting pits.
[133:51.94]Let's go see if he has what it takes.
[133:55.44]Do you have what it takes, Kuga?
[133:58.84]To make my mission easier.
[134:02.78]You know, right bumper, come on.
[134:06.50]He had a heart attack from all the excitement.
[134:08.16]Alright, do it up.
[134:14.25]Oh, the biggest, scariest guys are always the ones at the lowest levels.
[134:16.51]This is gonna be a fair fight.
[134:17.57]No, it's not.
[134:18.23]Alright, Karagors.
[134:33.99]It's always so unfair when a guy has a Karagor team.
[134:44.09]The guys keep kind of forgetting where they are.
[134:49.28]Don't let him do this.
[134:50.22]Come on, I need you to be there.
[134:51.36]I desperately need you to do that work.
[135:01.83]This is gonna last a long time.
[135:03.57]They're not even hurting each other.
[135:06.09]Are they just hard counters to each other?
[135:12.93]Yeah, make him focus on the beasts and then you hit him in the back.
[135:15.78]They both have the same weapon.
[135:17.84]My guy's is just a little smaller.
[135:19.44]They're both just fishes.
[135:23.22]With their bottom of the ocean fucking fish hooks.
[135:26.00]He's enraged.
[135:30.36]My fishhook is bigger than your fishhook.
[135:33.96]I promise you.
[135:41.30]Why can't they hurt each other?
[135:42.98]Are they both that bad?
[135:48.42]Neither one of you deserve to be a Warchief's bodyguard.
[135:50.82]You both suck.
[135:58.60]This is gonna go... This is gonna go to decision.
[136:02.09]You understand?
[136:02.73]This is the first time we're gonna get to decision.
[136:10.82]Why did he do that?
[136:14.06]Oh no, he burped in my face!
[136:17.64]Oh no.
[136:20.39]Nice.
[136:20.81]You can't even hurt him.
[136:26.96]He's so focused on the beast.
[136:29.55]Alright, it's over.
[136:32.95]And your winner, by knockout, Kuga the Prowler.
[136:42.73]He gained five levels too, god damn.
[136:49.36]Betrayal is now available, yep, yep.
[136:52.46]Okay, who else?
[136:53.50]We need to infiltrate this guy.
[136:57.19]So this guy has... You and you are there.
[137:00.51]Are you free to do something?
[137:05.35]You're already in that guy's wheelhouse there.
[137:10.25]Okay, what about you?
[137:10.91]What are you doing?
[137:14.17]He's involved in an active mission?
[137:16.13]What the hell are you doing?
[137:20.43]Okay, I think it's time to kill this guy.
[137:24.23]I do.
[137:31.28]It's time.
[137:39.21]Let's go kill the douche.
[137:43.93]Let's check out that legendary 24.
[137:47.69]Recruit an orc from the Feral tribe that is level 40 or higher.
[137:53.51]Well, I'm not even close to that right now, but that's fine.
[137:59.55]Let's break down some of these other ones.
[138:03.19]I have a lot of money.
[138:04.11]I should probably open up some in-game currency loot boxes, right?
[138:07.95]I have a lot of... 16,000.
[138:10.39]That's probably not that much.
[138:14.16]Um... Kill a captain is just better.
[138:17.66]Yeah, just get rid of this shit.
[138:21.50]I'm not gonna use it.
[138:28.55]Oh yeah, I'm not gonna kill douche.
[138:30.09]I'm gonna recruit douche.
[138:32.59]He's going to be on my team.
[138:40.24]I don't even use Quick Shot.
[138:44.82]Elf Shot, whatever the hell.
[138:45.68]I'm just going to use this.
[138:46.96]I don't care.
[138:51.15]Let's go straight up damage right now.
[138:53.35]Upgrade this.
[138:54.03]28 health recovered on a critical hit.
[138:57.77]That's great.
[139:02.72]Alright, let's go get that.
[139:04.18]What level?
[139:04.84]No, that guy.
[139:05.24]I have to shame him.
[139:06.16]Fuck, I can't recruit him.
[139:09.12]He's too high to recruit.
[139:10.38]That douche is way too high.
[139:11.84]I'm going to have to shame him twice.
[139:21.41]Damn it.
[139:22.85]That actually is what I have to do.
[139:24.13]What about the other guy?
[139:27.03]Let me go to the other menu.
[139:33.91]What level is this guy?
[139:34.69]31.
[139:35.11]They're both 31.
[139:39.51]Damn it.
[139:40.63]Why did he have to kill me?
[139:45.11]Um... I could just... I could kill him and then make one of these guys a Warchief.
[139:50.54]That's what we're gonna do.
[139:51.36]Fuck douche.
[139:53.40]The new Warchief is gonna be... Is it weird that I hate all these guys and none of them are interesting to me?
[140:07.96]None of these guys are cool.
[140:10.31]This guy's just dirty.
[140:13.55]That guy's dirty.
[140:16.23]I want to keep this guy.
[140:18.33]We're going to kill this guy and replace him.
[140:25.93]I don't think I actually can do that.
[140:30.24]What level is this guy?
[140:33.82]Ah, fuck it.
[140:34.74]Let's kill the douche.
[140:37.56]Why is the Ratloid's body still there?
[140:41.18]Because... What the fuck just happened?
[140:46.32]Usually when you stomp on a fire, you put it out.
[140:48.38]You don't make it worse.
[140:52.43]Stop down.
[140:58.87]Where's the front door?
[141:01.21]What is this one?
[141:04.50]This is the treasure hunt.
[141:06.34]Draw out Koth the Red.
[141:07.66]Alright, Koth the Red is... I don't think it's a guy I've seen yet.
[141:12.66]Is it?
[141:13.52]Is it the next... This is this guy right here.
[141:14.84]Okay, Koth the Red.
[141:15.54]He has... 19... Get intel on that guy on the right and I might do this one first.
[141:28.66]I'm just fucking gonna kill him.
[141:37.50]Or, let's take a look here.
[141:39.12]Capture this whole base.
[141:46.02]Siege upgrades.
[141:47.00]Who do I got?
[141:51.40]Wait, you think I can do it?
[141:56.36]No, don't.
[141:56.88]You will lose.
[141:57.60]I know.
[141:57.92]I'm just kidding.
[142:00.24]Gonna get my ass kicked.
[142:03.37]Eh, it's only level 269.
[142:11.23]I mean, I might be... I might be an idiot, and I might fuck around.
[142:16.37]But that is a guaranteed loss.
[142:19.79]That's like, that's going to the casino, and putting $10,000 on, like, Red 21.
[142:29.00]And thinking that that's a solid investment.
[142:33.12]Could you win?
[142:33.74]Sure.
[142:33.96]But you're not going to.
[142:42.13]So what's your diversified portfolio look like?
[142:44.67]You have mutual funds, bonds?
[142:47.43]Uh, no.
[142:49.15]I went to the casino and I put $40,000 on fucking double zero.
[142:55.15]Oh.
[142:56.91]Did you win?
[142:57.97]Yep.
[142:59.45]Oh.
[143:01.47]Okay.
[143:02.67]I'm going back next week.
[143:04.31]I'll do the same thing again.
[143:06.87]Good luck.
[143:08.21]I don't need luck.
[143:09.35]I have strategy.
[143:15.88]Hello.
[143:18.62]Then my game crashed.
[143:19.88]Alright.
[143:26.25]Douche the alchemist bodyguards are leading him into an ambush.
[143:30.65]Let's kill this douche.
[143:33.02]Once and for all.
[143:35.48]major look we knew you'd be coming this way so we made plans plans you won't survive to see us finish oh yep betrayal he's already almost dead he's arrow proof I forgot it's alright
[144:05.03]Keep him alive.
[144:16.12]Well, you're real easy when you don't have a lot of little shits following you around.
[144:19.60]Alright, what's the verdict here?
[144:22.26]Break him?
[144:23.60]What's the verdict?
[144:24.10]What do you think I should do?
[144:29.07]Should I... shame him?
[144:31.29]Kill him?
[144:32.23]Or try to recruit him?
[144:33.29]Like, shame him twice?
[144:37.83]Kill.
[144:38.57]Kill.
[144:39.65]Kill.
[144:41.62]I'm seeing a lot of kills.
[144:42.68]Yeah, let's kill him.
[144:47.06]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[144:47.94]Nope.
[145:01.08]Oh, no.
[145:03.56]Ratlord!
[145:05.16]Hey, look who we get to take.
[145:08.38]Wait, no.
[145:08.94]No, we don't.
[145:12.76]He's too high.
[145:14.00]No, I wanted to kill him!
[145:18.54]Well, it's okay.
[145:19.24]Now he'll level up.
[145:23.33]Now the Ratlord's here.
[145:24.41]Did I level up?
[145:28.77]Fortress has been weakened.
[145:29.57]This Warchief disabled Hellfire.
[145:31.99]All followers must survive.
[145:35.17]What level am I?
[145:36.47]Level 24.
[145:37.41]God damn it.
[145:39.07]Jesus.
[145:42.53]No.
[145:44.05]Stop running into the fire, you two idiots.
[145:47.51]Why is everybody so brainless when it comes to fire?
[145:49.87]Are you guys cavemen or are you orcs?
[145:54.46]What is going on right now?
[145:57.57]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[145:59.88]I can't do anything.
[146:00.82]I'm just, I'm like shit-faced.
[146:04.26]Looks like we're gonna have to kill Ratman.
[146:07.78]Because I can't take him.
[146:15.55]I guess I could shame him.
[146:24.56]He's like enraged.
[146:25.54]And now I have to like...
[146:28.29]I had an opportunity.
[146:29.36]I just, like... No... I had, like, a chance.
[146:41.92]I just got... Fuck it.
[146:43.08]He's... I would've... I would've... What is the button combination?
[146:49.39]It's Y and B, right?
[146:54.15]Yeah, nice job.
[146:54.99]Kuga the Killstealer.
[146:56.63]Thanks, man.
[147:05.19]Kuga the fucking Frisbee is his new name.
[147:11.27]Alright boys, reel it in.
[147:14.91]Reel it in!
[147:23.16]Okay.
[147:24.64]That was fun.
[147:25.66]Good work guys.
[147:29.79]Now, what we got over here?
[147:32.09]This raid, we can still do this raid.
[147:36.25]I do want to look at this thing.
[147:40.37]Okay, so he's dead.
[147:43.81]So, what if you infiltrate?
[147:50.55]No, no, he's not.
[147:51.31]I want him to be that guy.
[147:52.95]I guess I can't have him be that guy.
[147:56.41]I need to get this dude.
[147:57.93]We need to ambush this guy.
[148:02.93]Who else you got?
[148:03.37]This random unnamed dude.
[148:08.64]I want to collect these guys, though, so don't do that.
[148:15.20]Who do I want to be a Warchief?
[148:19.60]We'll try to take Og, but he's too high.
[148:37.52]Get in there.
[148:39.64]You want the Ratlord?
[148:40.38]Well, the Ratlord is currently permanently dead.
[148:42.64]There's an axe in his head.
[148:49.70]I mean... Aug is back, apparently.
[148:56.91]Where are these in the map?
[148:58.25]Let's go back to the pit.
[149:03.19]Back to the pit.
[149:08.29]Kill Og.
[149:09.39]No, we're not going to kill Og yet.
[149:11.33]I want to take Og.
[149:12.57]I want Og to be the Warchief.
[149:13.93]I want Og to be the ruler of the fortress.
[149:17.76]So... I want to do this.
[149:25.80]I mean, he's definitely going to come back.
[149:27.30]It's got to be tiring being the Ratlord.
[149:38.65]Probably is really tiring, actually.
[149:45.43]Almost there.
[149:46.31]Actually, let's get info on that other random captain that's on the right.
[149:56.27]This guy.
[149:59.10]Rug.
[150:02.60]That guy's dumb.
[150:06.80]Rug sucks.
[150:14.74]Whatever happened?
[150:15.20]Where's, like, Piss Drinker?
[150:16.58]You know what I mean?
[150:17.06]What happened to that guy?
[150:17.78]Wasn't there a funny guy named, like, Shit Man?
[150:20.28]Piss Drinker?
[150:20.90]Alright, prove yourself.
[150:26.82]It's time for you to prove it.
[150:31.88]The reason why I took you in the first place.
[150:34.39]Oh, shit.
[150:36.65]He's... Alright, he's... They're both on Karagors.
[150:44.11]It's literally whoever gets the first swing is going to win.
[150:46.65]Very good.
[150:49.31]And this guy gets two Karagors.
[150:51.64]Come on, man.
[150:53.64]He's a full level lower than you.
[150:56.30]You should be able to handle this.
[150:57.46]What are you doing?
[150:59.86]Why is the camera following him?
[151:01.06]Just running around in circles.
[151:02.84]He gets eaten over there.
[151:08.81]Good job.
[151:09.87]He's missing.
[151:10.61]At least they're both missing.
[151:17.34]Good good spread the fire spread the fire around his own character is her attacking him shoot him shoot him They just passing fire back and forth oh I got you idiots Shoot him again with fire here it comes.
[151:39.04]What is he the rapid but stop moving the camera around so much I

[151:51.02]Get in there.
[151:52.14]Unload.
[151:52.50]Rapid fire.
[151:54.20]Rapid fire!
[151:55.26]Good, good headshot!
[151:56.72]Do it again!
[151:58.40]Yes!
[151:58.74]Explode him!

[152:01.41]Two- He's got- He stands no chance.
[152:04.27]Why would you put- You just like, UFC'd him.
[152:11.61]Good.
[152:13.04]That's the end, right?
[152:15.65]You got so cocky, and don't even tell me that's why you lost.
[152:19.31]Don't!
[152:19.69]Stop playing with him!
[152:21.93]Thank God.
[152:25.73]Oh my Lord.
[152:27.64]If he had lost because he ran into the tackle, that would have been so unfortunate.
[152:34.02]Well, we got ourselves... We got ourselves a new Warchief.
[152:44.80]That works.
[152:45.76]Hooray.
[152:47.92]Alright, so you... Where's Og?
[152:51.04]I need to get a 26 before I do that.
[152:52.50]Alright, you currently follow you.
[152:55.17]Mark this guy and let's go up to this guy first.
[153:05.35]Where's he at?
[153:06.21]He's not that far away.
[153:07.07]Let's get some intel on him.
[153:14.21]see where he's at friendship ended with ratlord my crossbow guy is best friend that's one of the honestly the orc Pokémon stadium might be my favorite thing in the game
[153:42.06]Death threat.
[153:44.00]I guess I have all the details on him.
[153:48.03]Let's get some intel on Og.
[153:53.43]No death threats.
[153:54.07]It makes them stronger.
[153:54.85]It makes them higher level.
[153:56.25]Let me go that way.
[154:01.02]Just hopscotch over here.
[154:08.18]Why are you so...
[154:12.38]What's going on on the ice over there?
[154:13.70]Do they have a fire?
[154:19.44]Do they have a campfire out on the ice?
[154:21.94]Wait a second.
[154:24.92]I want to investigate this.
[154:31.76]What the fuck are you guys doing out here?
[154:38.89]Uh, somebody died.
[154:39.87]There's a Karagor.
[154:41.21]What's in there?
[154:41.89]Is that... What is going on here?
[154:51.23]That's where the fucking Balrog died.
[154:53.76]What about this?
[154:58.64]Have you never been ice fishing?
[154:59.84]Grog hunting.
[155:00.46]An enemy captain is heading a hunt for a Grog.
[155:02.12]Alright, let's just cut it off.
[155:05.02]This is... Exactly.
[155:06.46]The dork.
[155:08.07]Dork who devours.
[155:10.81]We have to get this guy.
[155:13.33]Don't let them win.
[155:14.43]We have to get the fucking dork devourer.
[155:15.96]Let's wait it out.
[155:28.99]We gotta get Hork the dork.
[155:40.97]Come on.
[155:44.39]Just chain this shit together.
[155:45.41]You have to get the guy that I can't fucking parry.
[155:51.34]Right next to you.
[155:52.42]Well, you've been frozen this whole time.
[155:53.74]Hopefully I don't, like, freeze your brain.
[155:57.82]I fucking can't execute this guy.
[155:59.20]Come on.
[155:59.61]I have to get Hork the door.
[156:09.32]I'm not even, like, hurting him.
[156:11.42]Oh, shit.
[156:12.36]It's okay.
[156:17.90]Don't kill him, please.
[156:19.18]Don't step on his head.
[156:21.14]Yeah!
[156:27.04]Shit.
[156:28.39]Come on.
[156:29.93]Do the damage to him so I don't have to.
[156:31.45]I could dominate, but will he run away?
[156:43.13]Alright, he's not my friend.
[156:46.34]This is why I did this.
[156:48.62]Alright.
[156:49.68]He's almost time to be broken.
[156:51.44]Alright, let's go.
[157:02.91]Oh, you shithead!
[157:04.65]Hork the dork is mine!
[157:11.23]Finally we have an interesting guy he's watching.
[157:14.79]Did you see that fucking arrow in his head?
[157:18.01]Alright, retreat.
[157:19.51]Go back.
[157:23.25]We just got like that close-up image of him with the fucking arrow in his head.
[157:30.02]He's just leaning in.
[157:31.38]What's happening over here?
[157:34.60]Alright, we're good.
[157:39.57]Well, now I have a friend.
[157:43.48]Finally.
[157:43.88]Hork the dork has to go to the fighting fence and he better win or I'm going to be excruciatingly upset about it.
[157:58.95]Should we challenge?
[158:01.73]What level is Hork the dork?
[158:06.83]There he is.
[158:09.32]Command.
[158:10.24]Um...
[158:14.59]It just infiltrate.
[158:17.61]He is buddy.
[158:19.99]He's 23, of course he is.
[158:26.65]Okay, come on.
[158:32.25]This is so important.
[158:33.92]If Hork fucking loses, then all is lost.
[158:47.32]Let's just get Rug as well.
[158:54.64]What the hell are you doing?
[158:59.71]Huh?
[159:00.19]What happened to my giant guy?
[159:02.59]Nah, here's the trap.
[159:10.77]Gonna run me into like a bunch of guys.
[159:13.41]Oh, Ranger!
[159:14.09]Look what I did!
[159:23.06]Huh?
[159:23.92]What the hell are you doing, man?
[159:27.66]Yeah, let's get dragged into a gank here.
[159:35.32]That's not cool.
[159:36.76]How can I not?
[159:43.55]Get up there, man.
[159:46.51]I have to clear some of these guys out because they're going to be a pain in my ass this whole time.
[159:50.61]Especially the big guys.
[159:58.65]They don't take that long to kill, but they are very annoying.
[160:15.82]You can do this, you can ride them around, swing them around.
[160:17.98]Dude's down there.
[160:19.67]I'm gonna shoot those with arrows.
[160:31.28]Oh, you broke my goddamn battleship, didn't you?
[160:34.36]Alright, that's good.
[160:36.28]Did everybody die?
[160:38.70]How?
[160:39.12]What?
[160:39.40]What the fuck just happened?
[160:40.28]Fuck off.
[160:54.19]I think he just accidentally killed everybody here.
[161:03.10]And we will dominate him, and we will take him.
[161:05.08]Elven Rage?
[161:10.96]I keep forgetting I have Elven Rage.
[161:14.22]Thanks for the reminder, I'm serious.
[161:24.07]Alright.
[161:24.89]We should have a good army.
[161:26.29]I got an epic dude.
[161:32.69]Let's see what I want him to do.
[161:34.55]Because right now, he is... He's currently underneath this guy's rule, right?
[161:39.95]So that's fine.
[161:43.43]That's fine.
[161:44.09]That's fine.
[161:45.19]Alright, I'm gonna keep it like this, because then I'll have these two... You could ambush this guy and just fucking kill him.
[161:51.28]Or I could go get this dude.
[161:58.74]Oh, you know what?
[162:01.00]Just go have fun somewhere.
[162:02.34]Just go be an orc.
[162:03.18]I don't want to do this.
[162:14.23]Go kill that guy.
[162:15.27]Fuck it.
[162:18.03]Go kill.
[162:18.61]Go ambush this guy.
[162:20.67]Get rid of him.
[162:28.37]So now we got this three people about to kill this guy.
[162:34.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[162:34.76]I kind of want to go watch that.
[162:37.06]Did I give three people the same mission to kill that same guy?
[162:42.09]I did, didn't I?
[162:51.11]Look at that.
[162:53.24]They're all going after him.
[162:56.63]This level 19.
[162:57.41]It doesn't need that.
[162:59.31]We don't need to do that many people going after you.
[163:02.64]Uh.
[163:03.62]Well.
[163:05.56]Sure.
[163:08.18]Let's go take a look.
[163:11.50]Let's.
[163:13.74]Mark him.
[163:16.40]This guy is in so much trouble.
[163:19.16]That's really far away with the teleport.
[163:23.51]Get more people after him.
[163:28.25]How many people can actually fight this guy at the same time?
[163:32.55]Okay, so Loram the Massive and Grisha the Immobile are facing each other in a duel.
[163:39.39]How dishonorable.
[163:42.04]I do need to watch this first, so let's do this first.
[163:44.20]I need to get out.
[163:50.70]Send everybody I have after him.
[163:56.01]Okay, fine.
[163:57.31]Closer.
[163:59.54]I can't.
[164:02.26]I don't think I can.
[164:05.54]You probably can only have up to three people fight him.
[164:10.07]I wish.
[164:10.43]Does the skull mean that they're dead?
[164:13.59]I think it means that... I don't know.
[164:23.53]Let's just do this first.
[164:25.19]We need to see this.
[164:28.65]I'm getting hungry too.
[164:29.47]What do you guys think I should have for food?
[164:36.37]If you guys could get food right now, what would you get?
[164:39.93]Some of my EU buds.
[164:43.24]Just standing right here.
[164:45.16]Might as well pick it up.
[164:45.82]It's a collectible item.
[164:50.70]Dirt.
[164:51.64]Ass.
[164:52.42]Well, first two are 10 out of 10 responses.
[164:55.18]That's the king's seal.
[164:56.38]That's the king's words.
[165:01.14]Fish and chips?
[165:01.80]Crab leg?
[165:02.48]Mmm.
[165:04.06]There is little there that interests me.
[165:06.74]And few who go there return.
[165:12.15]Sneak about.
[165:14.71]Crumpets?
[165:15.13]Mmm.
[165:16.51]Crumpets.
[165:18.81]Burgers?
[165:19.67]Burger King?
[165:23.19]Burgers?
[165:25.11]At times like this I ask myself, what would Sauron do
[165:33.62]Well... Didn't this guy lose in the fighting pits?
[165:42.75]He is so slow.
[165:46.07]He's arrow-proof.
[165:51.84]Well, he's beast-proof.
[165:54.26]And now he has beasts.
[165:55.64]Alright.
[165:57.02]You've got quite a lot of beasts, actually.
[166:00.50]Too bad your beasts aren't arrow-proof, otherwise we would be in trouble.
[166:03.98]And your beasts are about to become my beasts, sir.
[166:10.04]Just in case you were curious.
[166:13.64]I'm gonna make you kill your own fucking kin.
[166:24.87]Alright.
[166:26.05]Go get him!
[166:27.65]Now he has to fight his own family!
[166:40.66]Ow.
[166:40.80]That didn't make a goat noise?
[166:55.70]You guys hear the goat?
[166:57.71]This guy's actually kind of annoying.
[167:04.15]I can't shoot him with arrows.
[167:17.08]Can I please build up a combo?
[167:19.78]That would be fantastic.
[167:20.88]I just had a chance there.
[167:22.31]God damn it.
[167:22.83]Like that!
[167:23.17]Come on, give me a combo.
[167:23.95]We have to tame this guy.
[167:26.85]Because he is fucking awesome.
[167:28.25]He's really good.
[167:53.32]That was a double.
[167:54.10]It's elven rages, dude.
[168:01.79]Alright, that's good, that's good, that's good.
[168:03.05]Slow it down now, sir.
[168:08.81]Recruit!
[168:12.35]Get this guy into the funding bits, I agree.
[168:15.06]Uh, you can just run away for now.
[168:25.36]Camp raid is now available.
[168:27.42]Wait, is that them raiding that guy?
[168:32.20]I would laugh if that's what that is.
[168:41.33]Goodbye.
[168:41.79]Okay, I don't like the fighting pits here.
[168:44.69]It's like too awkward to get over there.
[168:48.74]It's super awkward to get there.
[168:49.84]You have to go through this random tunnel that's like on the other side.
[168:57.34]Where the fuck is it?
[168:57.88]It's like down here, right?
[169:05.51]Where is this stupid entrance?
[169:14.83]Where is this tunnel entrance?
[169:20.58]Can you rename captains?
[169:22.95]What are you doing here?
[169:29.19]Wait a minute.
[169:29.68]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[169:30.80]This is the dead Warchief.
[169:39.28]So he got, like, banished into exile.
[169:42.68]He's not a Warchief anymore.
[169:43.94]He's just, like, in a Brotherhood Without Banners situation, apparently.
[169:50.92]Weird.
[169:55.32]Wait, is he... He's just one of these guys I don't have... I'm confused.
[170:03.03]Yeah, I know, I am.
[170:05.75]Well, he's level 32.
[170:06.57]I think I used my Elven Rage.
[170:19.67]I gotta get rid of the banner.
[170:21.09]Oh my lord.
[170:25.35]Honest to fucking god.
[170:27.86]Do I actually have to kill?
[170:31.78]He's gonna level up again and shit just because of this stupid nonsense.
[170:37.30]Literally they all are swinging at every quarter of a second.
[170:40.46]Get the fuck out of here.
[170:49.95]Keep it going.
[170:50.83]Get the banner so they don't keep doing this shit.
[170:55.47]Get the banner!
[170:59.37]Oh my god.
[171:07.14]I gotta blow something up here.
[171:14.42]Take out my rocket launcher.
[171:15.54]I wish.
[171:18.62]Detonate it.
[171:20.22]That's the way for me.
[171:22.28]Let's go, douche.
[171:32.21]I tried to dodge too.
[171:33.35]I actually tried to do it.
[171:36.35]He's arrow-proof, of course he is.
[171:38.41]Why wouldn't he be?
[171:43.94]You two fight for me.
[171:52.98]Get rid of the banner!
[171:55.56]Get rid of the banner!
[172:01.36]Watch out for this edge.
[172:10.27]No, I wanted to stab the captain.
[172:13.75]What the hell?!
[172:16.35]I didn't know you could spawn enemies.
[172:17.85]I guess you have an enemy spawner.
[172:27.64]Give me my Karakor.
[172:30.66]Let's get some other dudes here for me.
[172:33.46]I can do that too, you know.
[172:35.02]Like, I'm complaining about that and I can do the same thing.
[172:40.21]That one didn't even subtle me.
[172:48.85]I'm gonna hop over.
[172:55.94]This move is so good.
[172:57.36]I can't even dominate him.
[173:04.54]I need to cut his head off, is what has to happen here.
[173:07.05]Let me just...
[173:16.26]Oh my god, there's too many.
[173:17.90]Can I like tell you guys to get out of here?
[173:22.84]No, don't eat him.
[173:23.46]Don't eat him.
[173:23.86]Don't eat him.
[173:24.22]Don't eat him.
[173:24.56]Don't eat him.
[173:24.88]Don't eat him.
[173:27.32]Oh my god, he fucking adapted.
[173:30.45]He's going to get randomly hit in the back and it's going to kill him.
[173:35.37]And now, alright, at least I got him.
[173:38.17]Now he's going to death defy, isn't he?
[173:39.73]Give me a fucking break.
[173:42.89]If he gets, is he going to get all his health back?
[173:47.18]No, take the head off take the head take the head take the head not the shoulder take his head, you know, he's dead Okay
[174:05.78]Give me one second.
[174:07.89]I'm going to go use the potty.
[174:09.89]And I'm going to go grab a snack.
[174:11.41]So give me one second.
[174:12.21]I'll be right back.
[174:12.95]Give me two seconds.
[174:14.15]I promise you.
[174:15.04]Two seconds count now.
[174:16.22]One, two.
[174:16.64]I'm back.
[174:17.12]Hey, how are you doing, guys?
[174:18.24]See you in a minute.
[177:17.68]Hello.
[177:22.17]We're back.
[177:32.15]Equipped world.
[177:32.83]Thanks for the three bucks.
[177:34.33]When you're watching your orc fight in the pits, it feels like you're a dad at your large orc son's soccer match, to be honest.
[177:41.82]It's great.
[177:42.30]I love it.
[177:44.38]It's a great feeling.
[177:47.29]Thank you, Crippro, for the three dollars.
[177:48.45]Also, SirFeline, thanks for the five bucks.
[177:51.16]When did they rename Dens to Talion?
[177:55.76]Uh... I don't know.
[177:59.56]That's a good question.
[178:00.74]This guy is so ugly.
[178:04.77]This guy is Humpty Dumpty doing a Joker cosplay.
[178:08.69]That's the best character we've ever come across so far in the whole game.
[178:14.61]Anyways, thanks.
[178:17.30]Also, Cowl the Dog, thanks for the two bucks.
[178:22.00]You very funny boy, thank you.
[178:29.66]Ratlord, never trust purple, thanks again for the five dollars.
[178:33.12]Ratlord died in the random explosion that went off behind Ogg like .5 seconds before I died.
[178:38.71]Alright, let's do it.
[178:45.26]We're getting close.
[178:47.04]We're getting close.
[178:47.72]I do still need to do Hork the Dork's mission and this ambush thing.
[178:51.62]Let's go see what Hork the Dork is up to.
[178:57.11]Pick up some stuff, like this thing.
[179:08.73]Also, where is the entrance here?
[179:13.16]I feel like I keep passing it, or I'm on the wrong side of the mountain.
[179:18.30]Good boy.
[179:18.66]You know what I'm saying?
[179:22.93]Like, I gotta, like, get on the other side of the mountain here?
[179:26.29]Like, go up that way?
[179:27.55]Is that what I'm missing?
[179:41.64]I think that guy just took a dive.
[179:45.36]There it is, okay.
[179:51.40]He so desperately wanted to be right next to me that he's just like, you know what, fuck it, I'm outta here.
[179:56.59]Alright, Hork the dork.
[179:59.73]Versus a random guy.
[180:01.51]Come on, this is the best person we've had so far.
[180:05.47]Come on!
[180:07.08]Oh no!
[180:09.89]He's got like a... He's got a gun?
[180:13.07]Does this guy have a gun?
[180:15.80]He's got a gun.
[180:22.28]He does.
[180:22.68]He has a fucking... No.
[180:33.83]Come on, dork.
[180:36.85]Come on, you fucking dork.
[180:39.61]Do a good, nice spear attack.
[180:42.17]Don't let him fucking shoot you.
[180:43.81]Don't let him shoot you with the Ghostbusters flamethrower.
[180:46.37]He's unfeeling himself.
[180:51.41]You got this.
[180:52.47]Just be cautious, be careful.
[180:55.65]He's gonna use his fucking good, feel good goo from Ghostbusters 2, except it's fire.
[181:03.19]What are you doing?
[181:07.10]No, no, no, no.
[181:11.35]He's gonna win.
[181:12.26]There's no way he loses this.
[181:16.48]He's not gonna lose that one.
[181:17.98]Look at the guy over there.
[181:21.24]Although, this might not be well because he might just be running around on fire this whole time.
[181:26.93]He's gonna accidentally kill him.
[181:28.57]Come on, just turn and accidentally swing and hit him once.
[181:31.21]Please, Hork?
[181:34.01]You just have to stab him once.
[181:36.91]Do not get embarrassed.
[181:40.20]Good block.
[181:42.14]Is that a trap?
[181:43.88]Alright, good.
[181:46.36]We win.
[181:49.64]Borg is victorious.
[181:53.98]Face only a fucking fry a tuck could love.
[181:58.45]Okay.
[182:00.61]That was so dumb.
[182:02.91]I can't believe they have flamethrowers in this game.
[182:07.05]So that means... So here we go.
[182:10.11]We got...
[182:11.14]Hork is now under this guy's control.
[182:13.59]We've got to get this guy out.
[182:19.29]So, this guy currently has everybody following him.
[182:24.35]That's that mission.
[182:26.89]Let's go do it.
[182:29.21]I knew they were guns.
[182:32.69]Very primitive guns, but still guns nonetheless.
[182:41.50]Alright, let me get some skill points in here.
[182:47.50]Almost to the end of the tree.
[182:50.60]This, yeah.
[182:53.14]If you just touch it, you just pick it up.
[182:56.02]Sitting there and hitting RB is just never fun.
[182:59.74]Takes too long.
[183:04.87]That's a long ways away.
[183:08.63]It's fast travel.
[183:11.86]Ah, shit, I don't have it yet.
[183:13.22]Let's go to this one.
[183:13.86]Alright, here we go.
[183:16.92]No, it's not that one.
[183:23.89]Hey, Jerma, if you hold X and tap rapidly Y, you can eat shit for free.
[183:27.87]Well, I read that out loud.
[183:29.01]Okay.
[183:35.32]I felt myself reading that.
[183:44.07]Carragor's randomly eating people.
[183:45.55]Speaking of Carragor... That was a great comment.
[184:01.52]Free intel, might as well just take it.
[184:07.06]No reason not to.
[184:13.36]Quarsh Vat Keeper.
[184:15.34]He's terrified of spiders.
[184:20.17]Well, that's the other Warchief.
[184:29.67]Mm-hmm.
[184:32.15]And then we'll take on this other Warchief.
[184:33.83]And then, I think we have a solid shot.
[184:37.51]At that point.
[184:38.45]I do.
[184:40.71]We're gonna make a duel.
[184:43.16]Lorem the Massive and Grisha the Immovable are facing each other in a duel.
[184:51.11]Let's see how this duel plays out.
[184:55.23]Want me to kill you fast or kill you slow?
[184:58.61]Is the game worth buying?
[184:59.37]I think so.
[185:00.77]The more you speak, the more I want to shred your face!
[185:04.79]He gets his level 1 enemies that he has.
[185:06.41]So... I don't think I need... I don't even need to do anything.
[185:13.33]We can just watch.
[185:18.19]This guy has two of his buddies that can jump in.
[185:19.83]Should I just be an asshole and stealth kill?
[185:27.81]Is he running away?
[185:32.87]Why is everyone just getting in the way over here?
[185:42.97]I don't... I guess... Okay, fine.
[185:44.45]I'll help him.
[185:46.39]We're going out of the mission area.
[185:48.33]Oh, wow.
[185:49.43]You can't both swing at the same time like that.
[185:56.18]Oh!
[185:56.34]It's alright.
[185:56.78]I got it.
[186:16.05]Spin him around.
[186:21.90]Damn it!
[186:24.54]He's a ball breaker.
[186:27.38]It don't matter.
[186:28.11]Did you say, let's blow up Middle Earth?
[186:32.27]Not a smart idea.
[186:35.29]I always do that out of just... Good, now come in and help me out here.
[186:40.99]And we'll be taking you.
[186:44.83]At least I thought we'd be taking you.
[186:46.51]I think we might be ready to siege the castle.
[187:05.40]Because only these two guys remain.
[187:08.34]I guess not, really.
[187:11.24]It might be fun just to go in and just try it.
[187:13.63]What do you think?
[187:14.31]Blood?
[187:15.67]Should we just... Are we going for blood here?
[187:18.95]I'll take out this guy, and then we'll go in for blood.
[187:21.09]We'll go in with two left.
[187:24.97]We do have to deal with Aug still.
[187:29.29]So this guy's not ready to be taken.
[187:30.67]Play quest, target this enemy.
[187:31.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[187:33.41]Just...
[187:34.84]I don't really care where the fuck you go, to be honest.
[187:39.86]I make you... You're already, like, infiltrating this guy.
[187:47.40]He can't really do anything.
[187:48.48]Just go... Just go, like... Just go kill this idiot.
[187:54.82]Go for it.
[188:02.19]Og is still alive.
[188:02.89]Og came back.
[188:06.74]Mission complete.
[188:07.30]He dominated him, and he claimed victory.
[188:09.80]Good, good, good work.
[188:10.80]Alright, let's go.
[188:11.80]25.
[188:11.82]I still can't dominate.
[188:12.76]I can't dominate Og until 26.
[188:14.08]That's unfortunate, isn't it?
[188:15.81]Mm-hmm.
[188:35.13]What happened to the guy that got ambushed by three people?
[188:36.96]It was that guy right there.
[188:37.88]They were all just waiting, watching the fight.
[188:41.22]He probably could have killed one by one everybody there.
[188:45.48]Where did I just go?
[188:48.72]Thank god there's no fall damage.
[188:51.40]I'm so happy how idiot-proof this game actually is.
[188:53.58]I'm trying to be fancy about it.
[189:09.33]Just get up there.
[189:10.07]All you gotta do is lunge up.
[189:11.51]There you go.
[189:13.53]Let's cleanse this.
[189:15.43]Kill that Warchief.
[189:16.97]At that point, hopefully we can get Og and then take over the castle.
[189:28.30]I don't really...
[189:31.45]I don't yeah, I have to stuff.
[189:33.69]I'm I'll do that later.
[189:35.01]That's okay.
[189:35.51]That's okay for another time in quotes, you know so Let's mark this guy But he still has this one captain That bag is still do it I got I got the dork with me it's just him in one captain I
[189:59.19]Steal his treasure.
[190:00.61]I think we'll be fine.
[190:06.67]So how far away is that?
[190:08.10]It's pretty far away.
[190:09.96]Can I fast travel to right here?
[190:24.43]I think we are going to be fine.
[190:27.70]I don't see a reason why we lose this so horribly.
[190:33.18]2v2.
[190:39.32]Death incoming?
[190:40.26]Maybe.
[190:43.66]Wait, what is this?
[190:48.53]Oh.
[190:49.31]Poison tendril.
[190:53.19]What is this one?
[190:53.77]Brutal aggression.
[190:54.53]I already have it, right?
[190:56.05]No, I don't.
[191:06.47]Play evil play evil within two again.
[191:08.67]I can't I Just really I did get just started to bore me and I just didn't wasn't having any fun with it I'm sure if I gave it like another couple hours or something.
[191:20.00]I might get like me into it, but I don't know I
[191:28.37]Put this Warchief's loot under threat, and he will risk everything to save it.
[191:32.36]Hopefully it's not inside the capital, inside the building.
[191:35.58]Shit, it is.
[191:38.62]Well, this is going to be harder than I thought.
[191:39.88]Yeah, we're going to make some poop soup.
[191:49.35]Alright, what do we got?
[191:49.99]We got you...
[191:54.58]You know, there's no reason to stealth kill anymore.
[191:56.94]When I can just stealth dominate.
[191:58.63]And at least somebody will maybe do a pot shot on someone.
[192:02.45]Alright, so... Where's the treasure?
[192:14.40]I need to steal two treasures.
[192:16.00]Let's go around the side.
[192:23.64]Everybody up on the rooftop.
[192:24.94]Let's just keep moving over here.
[192:33.33]There's one.
[192:38.11]How heavily guarded are the other ones?
[192:39.41]If I'm going to do this correctly... I have to do it stealthy.
[192:46.65]Because this is the fortress.
[192:53.14]There we go.
[192:53.50]This one's sort of guarded.
[192:55.68]It's very guarded.
[193:02.11]It's super guarded, but not enough for me to not want to get it.
[193:12.19]Well, okay, I wanted to do that, but... Do some ground execution kills.
[193:29.68]I think... I might be wrong here.
[193:31.88]I think the prompts are only on the screen.
[193:34.96]They're on the screen for a lot less time, it feels like, when you're on Nemesis.
[193:38.30]That's good, fine.
[193:42.61]I'm alright with that.
[193:50.69]Steal the treasure!
[193:56.14]This last one... we'll go right over here.
[194:04.94]Come here, drunk man!
[194:07.69]Well, next is why to use poop arrows.
[194:10.45]Are we really on the poop thing still?
[194:13.96]Come on, guys, we can do better than think poo-poo.
[194:18.60]This guy only has 50 silver, I know.
[194:22.16]What a treasure.
[194:23.98]Dude, I got, like, 17k.
[194:28.68]Right there.
[194:35.87]Hello.
[194:39.39]Stealth-brutalize.
[194:40.35]Scare the shit out of people.
[194:50.31]I want to do some ground execution deals with it.
[194:53.35]I haven't really had an opportunity to.
[194:54.53]Get on the ground, man.
[195:00.94]I mean, he's not on the ground.
[195:02.00]Oh, fuck it.
[195:03.70]Who cares?
[195:04.14]I'm not doing this yet.
[195:10.71]Because there's two of these huge guys.
[195:12.69]And he's ringing the bell.
[195:13.81]Don't ring the bell.
[195:14.51]Don't ring the bell.
[195:15.17]Don't you dare.
[195:18.96]Dumb dick.
[195:20.64]God.
[195:24.51]Well, I can't not like this man.
[195:26.29]I gotta kill these guys first.
[195:27.95]That's one.
[195:30.81]That's two.
[195:32.27]This is how I die?
[195:33.81]Not yet.
[195:49.13]Maybe, but not right this second.
[195:50.77]Shit, I'm trying to hit B. Oh well.
[195:54.87]Fuck, I didn't see the prompt until I got too close!
[196:08.58]I missed it.
[196:11.26]Who's the last couple of guys shooting?
[196:13.30]Where are you?
[196:20.83]Well, that is what we call a mistake.
[196:22.87]If you'd like to see a mistake in real time, you just saw it.
[196:25.49]Let's just bring him out here.
[196:32.11]Hoth the Red has arrived.
[196:34.24]Get backstabbed.
[196:34.90]They're right next to me over here.
[196:36.22]Okay, come on, Hork.
[196:41.44]It's 2v2 in here.
[197:01.87]Jesus Christ.
[197:06.97]Who did that?
[197:07.49]Did Horv do that?
[197:16.45]Shit, man.
[197:17.11]Like these fucking bombs everywhere.
[197:19.03]I can't even tell you who's doing that shit.
[197:27.65]He's almost dead.
[197:29.53]I'm okay if Hork gets the kill here.
[197:34.74]I am.
[197:41.66]I don't have any... Wow!
[197:46.48]What the fuck?!
[197:50.79]Oh, I just went inside of a rock.
[197:56.41]Dude!
[198:09.33]Holy shit, Hork is kicking his ass.
[198:13.15]No, no, no, fuck that Karagor.
[198:23.19]Jesus Christ.
[198:25.55]He's almost done.
[198:26.03]Watch out for the double shooter.
[198:30.78]Elven rage, come on.
[198:31.62]I don't have it yet, fuck.
[198:35.05]Hork is just doing this skewer move over and over again.
[198:42.95]No, no!
[198:43.79]Hork can't die!
[198:47.14]Die, you fucker!
[198:49.42]Yes!
[198:52.50]Executed!
[198:57.48]Stay alive, Hork!
[199:00.54]The fortress has been weakened, defeating this Warchief as disabled hunter host.
[199:11.19]No, the Hork, don't die.
[199:12.95]I have to make sure I keep him alive.
[199:14.39]He's gonna, like, bleed.
[199:15.61]Alright, you good?
[199:22.96]Don't, just get us out of here.
[199:24.38]We're good.
[199:26.52]I gotta make Hork the new Warchief.
[199:27.78]Alright, we're good.
[199:31.38]Uh, army.
[199:34.60]I want Hork in there.
[199:41.93]Infiltrate it.
[199:43.55]New Warchief.
[199:49.76]Grab him so he doesn't die.
[199:51.16]Hork, where the fuck are you going, man?
[199:57.96]So I have to go here and then up.
[199:59.76]I don't like that.
[200:00.92]No, let's put that here.
[200:09.46]New Warchief, Hork.
[200:15.66]Aug SkullSplitter really wants me to go fight Aug, huh?
[200:21.96]Oh, shit.
[200:25.16]Okay, guys.
[200:27.84]This is it.
[200:30.56]This is what you came for.
[200:38.07]Hork versus Aug.
[200:42.69]The Aug is one level higher than him, but...
[200:46.58]I think he can still do it.
[200:47.46]At least I hope so.
[200:57.45]Hey Jerm, if you press down on the D-pad fast enough while brutalizing, you can animation cancel into a poo-poo pee-pee.
[201:02.45]Oh.
[201:02.63]Wow.
[201:03.17]Yeah, you can.
[201:03.97]Hey!
[201:10.33]Hey, don't do that, sir!
[201:20.34]Alright, I'm actually like very concerned about this I'm concerned about this 25 versus 26 look at the details here So he is enraged by ghouls who cares I
[201:45.34]War banners, he calls reinforcements.
[201:47.94]Drives orcs into a vengeful frenzy when he dies.
[201:51.51]He does get a couple of hunters with him, though.
[201:53.23]That's a good thing.
[201:54.87]He's immune to executions.
[201:58.09]Damaged by beasts.
[201:59.11]He's fear of flies.
[202:00.22]Alright, I think this is an easy win for Hork.
[202:07.38]This is an easy win for him.
[202:08.44]He's going to have a crew.
[202:10.88]He's got a commander.
[202:13.21]Do it.
[202:19.01]Remember, he might be a little bit higher level, but he has to deal with the crew.
[202:24.28]Right off the bat.
[202:29.58]Throw him right into the crowd.
[202:30.64]Good work.
[202:34.17]He's got that shield.
[202:34.95]It's really protecting him.
[202:35.95]It's alright.
[202:37.61]He's going to get interrupted by all the people throwing.
[202:45.30]Although they're barely hurting him.
[202:48.46]Nice counter.
[202:53.23]Come on, dude.
[202:54.91]Let it go to decision.
[203:00.15]They're not even hurting him.
[203:01.57]Why?
[203:03.41]Make something happen here.
[203:04.29]Doesn't he have a grenade?
[203:10.64]This is...
[203:13.51]Do something else.
[203:14.17]Throw a grenade.
[203:14.87]Throw something.
[203:15.49]Nice stabs.
[203:21.56]This guy's doing that one move that he knows how to do in like Mortal Kombat 10.
[203:26.56]Holy shit, that hurts.
[203:29.62]Get out the chains.
[203:31.81]We got a victory here.
[203:35.73]Og is fucked.
[203:37.89]Stuff hanging out of his back.
[203:39.63]This guy's a pincushion.
[203:46.43]Doesn't matter if he's higher, he's a defender.
[203:52.63]There's way more holes in this guy.
[203:54.16]Uh-oh, that's not good.
[203:59.82]Orc is not intimidated by executions though, so that's a good thing.
[204:05.32]I really don't want this to go to a decision.
[204:09.20]Like, four, like, orc judges raise their thumbs up or down?
[204:11.77]How does this work?
[204:18.82]We gotta end it here.
[204:22.14]He's brought it back.
[204:28.29]I don't even know what happens.
[204:31.05]We've never seen one go past three minutes.
[204:33.05]Uh-oh.
[204:37.65]Poison?
[204:42.57]Is he regenerating?
[204:43.21]I don't think he's regenerating.
[204:49.09]Oh, no.
[204:50.97]I think he wins.
[204:51.87]No, he is.
[204:52.45]He's healing.
[204:52.99]He is healing.
[204:55.09]Oh, god damn it.
[204:56.31]You gotta put an execute on him right here.
[204:58.73]That's what I'm talking about.
[204:59.63]Do it again.
[205:01.79]Do that shit one more time.
[205:03.96]Come on.
[205:06.18]Terrified?
[205:10.68]No, not terrified.
[205:14.80]Not terrified.
[205:17.49]No, please don't.
[205:18.63]Dude, please.
[205:20.95]You had the upper hand.
[205:21.95]You were doing so well.
[205:27.04]You just have to get him with one more of those and he'll be... Now I kind of hope it goes to fucking zero.
[205:35.14]His executes do a lot of damage.
[205:40.57]Ten seconds.
[205:43.17]Ten seconds to not die.
[205:46.33]And get humiliated.
[205:48.78]Daaah!
[205:51.40]No!
[205:52.94]Why?
[205:54.22]Oh, come on!
[205:58.70]He had an opportunity like three different times.
[206:13.93]Fuck you, buddy!
[206:18.69]Now I'm taking you out.
[206:20.37]Ow.
[206:27.55]Does that hurt?
[206:28.85]Fucking green goblin with him, motherfucker.
[206:36.17]Seriously.
[206:45.49]We're killing him, by the way.
[206:46.40]I'm not letting him live.
[206:50.05]Wait!
[206:51.33]What the fuck?
[206:55.07]Since where did you come from?
[207:06.45]Get it!
[207:07.07]Get it!
[207:07.35]Oh, why?
[207:10.10]Enraged by Karagors.
[207:11.70]Oh, wow.
[207:12.42]Great.
[207:13.08]Why did you bring these here?
[207:20.18]Just get the kill.
[207:20.82]So I don't have to deal with him later.
[207:23.64]I'm serious.
[207:26.36]Oh, he's just gonna be enraged.
[207:28.82]He's gonna do this thing over and over again.
[207:30.12]He's just healing right now, too.
[207:31.45]This is such a disaster.
[207:41.79]You're enraged by Karagors?
[207:42.87]Well, isn't that just too bad?
[207:54.10]Die.
[207:54.52]Just cover him.
[208:02.44]No, we're killing him.
[208:03.91]I was supposed to kill Ogg a long time ago.
[208:05.63]Ogg was supposed to die like six hours ago.
[208:14.33]So he's dead.
[208:14.83]He's gone.
[208:15.27]We got rid of him.
[208:15.89]We're good to go.
[208:21.74]Some new stuff.
[208:26.58]Heal.
[208:28.21]And I think we're ready.
[208:29.71]Let's check it.
[208:32.97]He's still looking at us.
[208:38.39]At least we avenged him.
[208:42.19]We gotta get out of this zone here.
[208:47.29]Imagine it.
[208:48.69]It's all cause and effect, guys.
[208:49.75]If I killed Og when I first streamed the game, like five days ago.
[208:56.75]pork would still be alive.
[208:58.03]Smells.
[208:59.37]That's terrible to think about.
[209:00.49]Oh well.
[209:05.18]Although there is... What is this for?
[209:07.18]A thief in the night.
[209:11.10]Draw out Kosh by killing his warriors without triggering the alarm.
[209:17.00]Let me just take a look at what his deal is.
[209:23.48]Crush.
[209:23.84]Level 30.
[209:24.00]He controls these two...
[209:32.67]I think I'm ready to raid this capital here.
[209:40.95]I think I can do this on my own here.
[209:42.45]Yeah, I can.
[209:45.20]I'll take him out.
[209:48.72]Kill his worries without triggering the alarm.
[209:51.12]Let's try it.
[209:53.38]Show this warchief the uselessness of his defenses by killing his orcs before they can sound the alarm.
[210:02.13]And then he'll come out.
[210:03.11]And I honestly should.
[210:07.21]No, no, no, no, no.
[210:10.40]Dismissed.
[210:10.80]Dismissed.
[210:11.30]No, shit.
[210:11.98]No, no, no.
[210:12.44]Dismissed.
[210:14.08]You're dismissed.
[210:15.42]Go home.
[210:16.70]All of you.
[210:17.12]Alright, just go blend in somewhere.
[210:22.31]Gonna brutalize some people.
[210:34.63]I don't see any alarm bells yet.
[210:47.25]Do what has to be done.
[210:48.35]Well, I guess we're just gonna knock you over here.
[211:07.03]Pull it out.
[211:08.03]Whip it out!
[211:09.09]Whip it out, whip it out, whip it out, whip it out.
[211:16.30]Eat shit.
[211:22.68]Two more.
[211:26.84]I do want to brutalize somebody, but... No, don't light the beacon.
[211:36.48]Brutalize isn't going to work right now.
[211:38.76]Here he comes.
[211:41.44]Actually, this is going to be hard.
[211:43.47]This is going to be very hard.
[211:46.13]Where are you going?
[212:11.27]Do I have... I don't think I even have any intel on this guy.
[212:16.85]I didn't take any of his guards.
[212:17.91]This is not going to work.
[212:21.81]Let's see.
[212:22.83]Do I have any... I have intel on him, right?
[212:26.25]He's terrified of spiders.
[212:27.61]Don't I have a thing?
[212:29.55]Vulnerable to stealth.
[212:32.27]I don't think I have any skill points, because I think I have that opportunity to be able to
[212:37.90]Yeah, I can't.
[212:39.14]No, whatever.
[212:39.52]I'll just try to stealth him.
[212:46.38]Give it a go.
[212:48.74]Refill my arrows.
[212:54.03]Just fucking roadkill.
[212:55.35]Okay, cool.
[212:56.65]I don't care about the roadkill right now.
[213:01.39]I'm glad they don't range into Mordor.
[213:04.11]Even a pack of wargs would find survival here difficult.
[213:06.95]I've never seen a warg before.
[213:08.25]Let's take a look.
[213:15.72]I have info on everybody.
[213:17.94]Do I have info on you?
[213:18.94]No.
[213:21.68]Mortally flammable.
[213:23.34]Flammable.
[213:23.82]Alright, so if I get an explosion going here...
[213:37.32]Does he freak out to anything?
[213:38.52]Poison weapon.
[213:40.76]Beastial roar.
[213:41.62]Enraged by mortal wounds.
[213:43.02]Beast proof.
[213:44.32]Forget about Karagors.
[213:46.99]What about his... I'm going to try to explode something because it will kill both of those guys.
[213:51.59]Or at least one of them.
[213:53.89]I'll try to stealth this out until they get to a barrel I can blow up.
[214:00.73]Let's see if there's a barrel right... They're about to walk by one right there.
[214:05.95]I don't know if they're close enough, though.
[214:12.59]No, I gotta make sure.
[214:13.37]I gotta make it count, you know what I mean?
[214:14.71]Because that guy, I think, dies to fire.
[214:22.55]Oh, there we go!
[214:27.14]See you later.
[214:34.84]One down.
[214:35.54]Rock the Mouth.
[214:39.92]I like this guy.
[214:43.50]Okay, now I gotta get through this quickly before they sound an alarm or something.
[215:10.61]Yeah, I'm gonna just get outplayed, you know what I mean?
[215:14.47]Shit, he's enraged by pinning!
[215:17.39]Of all the stupid things you could be enraged by.
[215:29.48]Like, oh my god, I'm so angry that you pin- Goddammit, that's just the downfall right there, you know what I mean?
[215:35.44]Oh, that's the downfall right there.
[215:45.24]Oh, shit.
[215:53.25]Just hang out.
[215:53.91]Hang tight.
[215:54.37]I'll be alright.
[215:55.55]Just give me some more health shot.
[216:01.35]Enraged by pinning.
[216:04.15]Every time I watch a fucking WWF game, it just, like, makes me so scared.
[216:10.41]Don't you dare.
[216:23.17]I don't even care.
[216:27.91]It's like just fucking chaos up here.
[216:29.56]That's what I want.
[216:30.16]Who even gives a shit?
[216:54.29]Why would you even come up here man?
[217:02.09]He's like in the worst possible spot No, fuck that just kill him
[217:16.56]I don't want to give this guy a chance.
[217:17.76]I want to cut his head clean off his shoulders.
[217:22.03]Goodbye.
[217:22.47]See you later, Warchief.
[217:28.75]Let me get up on this really easily accessible platform.
[217:34.23]Poison spells have been disabled.
[217:35.47]Good.
[217:42.87]Now he's terrified.
[217:43.53]Drop the bugs on him!
[217:47.52]Terrified of that?
[217:49.92]Oh boy, he's mine.
[217:50.96]I'm gonna, I'm gonna take this guy.
[218:00.61]Hello!
[218:05.41]This is the weird dumb guy, right?
[218:06.67]Yeah.
[218:07.71]I don't, I don't know!
[218:18.81]We need orcs in charge of everything.
[218:20.51]Actually, I gotta get out of here.
[218:25.59]Well, that's the only way to do it.
[218:30.37]I'm a little bit on my category now.
[218:34.36]Fine, just jump back.
[218:37.24]Just get out of fucking London.
[218:39.12]Run, run, run, run, run.
[218:40.20]Foggy London town.
[218:42.92]I gotta make that guy the new Sauron.
[218:48.50]Alright.
[218:49.50]I think it's time to siege the castle.
[218:51.06]There's only one Warchief.
[218:52.10]I got a lot of friends.
[218:55.52]Most of the defenses are done.
[218:58.96]Speaking of it, I'm just in there right now.
[219:01.92]Can I just do it right now?
[219:02.76]Can I just go in and kill the bad guy?
[219:06.90]I'll check my items in a minute.
[219:07.86]I just want to get out of here.
[219:09.66]I'm going to sneak through this random little tunnel.
[219:14.19]Can I not go in there?
[219:14.93]Damn it.
[219:18.80]Up, up, and away.
[219:27.48]And there we go.
[219:28.10]Okay, let's take a look at what I have here.
[219:39.91]So.
[219:42.57]I have two possible Warchief positions.
[219:47.68]I lost my dork.
[219:49.08]I lost Hork.
[219:51.39]24, 21, 19, 23, 25.
[219:51.49]Alright, we're gonna... Lorm, go take this spot.
[220:05.52]Confirm it.
[220:06.22]We need at least a couple of Warchiefs in there.
[220:11.52]So it's this guy versus him.
[220:13.75]Let's hope he's not good.
[220:18.56]to get over there.
[220:22.43]I'm not close.
[220:23.73]We'll get close.
[220:26.43]You don't know.
[220:27.09]I don't know.
[220:27.67]I just don't know.
[220:33.83]We get to watch two more fights and then I'm going to siege the castle.
[220:40.69]Make flamethrower guy a warchief.
[220:42.39]I'll try it on the next one.
[220:51.87]Let's go.
[220:52.83]Come here.
[220:54.79]Come on.
[220:56.93]Come on.
[221:00.57]Sorry.
[221:02.75]Kill the last Warchief?
[221:05.22]Oh, I think we can do it.
[221:07.78]It'll be a little bit of a challenge.
[221:08.96]It'll be fun.
[221:17.46]Just wanted to send a message, that's all.
[221:23.83]Alright.
[221:26.75]Warchief.
[221:28.55]Begin.
[221:34.50]Karagor versus Karagor.
[221:35.48]We're gonna mirror match.
[221:36.76]Do we?
[221:37.02]Oh, no.
[221:38.04]Shit.
[221:39.20]That's level 26.
[221:42.14]This is gonna... Why would you sit there and let him do that to you?
[221:56.35]How many?
[221:58.73]Is he still on the ground?
[222:00.41]He just got like served, man.
[222:05.61]He really did.
[222:07.83]Well, at least we got a fight.
[222:16.20]Pretty nice good luck overhead scoop slam.
[222:18.16]I like it.
[222:19.28]Good work.
[222:21.72]But he's enraged, so this is bad.
[222:25.84]Now he's on fire.
[222:27.44]And he's not even gonna get a word in edgewise.
[222:34.99]He is a berserker though.
[222:38.33]Who's left?
[222:38.77]This is it.
[222:40.45]Karagor's dead.
[222:41.13]Oh god damn it.
[222:45.82]Give me a fucking break.
[222:46.90]He's gonna lose.
[222:47.76]Maybe not.
[222:54.88]I would clear the adds.
[222:57.68]Forget about the guy with the spear.
[223:00.86]He's not doing terribly.
[223:06.40]Nice trap.
[223:11.28]Beautiful.
[223:13.30]Step in that trap to end it.
[223:15.30]And that's game over.
[223:15.94]We got a new Warchief.
[223:22.36]That did so much damage.
[223:27.86]Alright, we got another one to do.
[223:30.70]Flamethrower guy.
[223:32.59]That was awesome.
[223:37.27]So, this is the guy with the flamethrower, right?
[223:38.85]Machine Beastmaster.
[223:43.00]He's currently on an active mission.
[223:46.54]It's advanced time here.
[223:59.62]Got some new battle reports.
[224:03.20]New unknown captains.
[224:06.18]Okay, everything's alright.
[224:10.33]Fuck, you guys are still on a new mission?
[224:12.01]On an active mission?
[224:18.99]Let's go with you.
[224:20.09]I mean, you're here.
[224:20.91]Just do it.
[224:24.23]I don't know.
[224:27.21]Oh fuck, I thought I could just advance time into knowing he was going to come all the way back here.
[224:36.29]Well shit, that's annoying.
[224:42.75]And then we're taking it to the base.
[224:51.06]Mark it.
[224:54.21]It's because I'm stupid and I always don't know where the hell I'm going.
[224:59.51]There's a lot of maps and a lot of icons in this game.
[225:04.23]Can you have two of your own guys fight?
[225:06.67]Yes, you can.
[225:08.15]I believe you have to own the castle first, though.
[225:10.77]I might be wrong, but I know you can have two of your own followers fight.
[225:19.03]So you can do your own...
[225:21.91]Just constant stream of orc fights.
[225:25.93]And I don't mean that stream, like, literally, like, live stream.
[225:28.19]I mean, like, stream.
[225:29.09]Like, a bunch of them in a row.
[225:31.11]Alright, Kuga.
[225:37.88]Let's see it happen.
[225:41.52]This guy's such a chump.
[225:45.66]Anytime a guy has a default orc sword and one of those goofy helmets on, it means they're gonna lose.
[225:54.04]Alright, well they both they both have the same it's a mirror apparently Hopefully it's not as much as a mirror as we think I wonder what's gonna happen here.
[226:13.71]Oh, I'm gonna kill your horse.
[226:15.11]I'm with your and then you'll kill mine So where were we?
[226:26.16]Good dodges.
[226:31.14]Going for the good chokeslam.
[226:35.34]If this guy could stop taunting.
[226:37.57]That's just a taunt.
[226:38.27]He's not actually doing damage.
[226:41.71]Jeez, man.
[226:42.21]This guy sucks.
[226:46.21]This guy keeps doing the same move.
[226:49.29]It doesn't even hurt my guy.
[226:51.67]He's gonna take his head off right here.
[226:57.31]He keeps going with a chokeslam.
[227:07.41]The funniest part about that is that should be doing more damage than my guy's doing.
[227:12.88]It might be leveled up.
[227:13.78]New Warchief.
[227:15.48]It's time to fight.
[227:20.81]I love this game.
[227:21.43]This game is so fucking great.
[227:22.69]Alright, we got three of Warchiefs.
[227:25.55]Let's at least get intel on this guy.
[227:31.79]At least.
[227:34.37]Because I'm gonna be bringing in two or three guys of my own and three of my infiltrated Warchiefs.
[227:41.15]Let's get intel on him.
[227:44.15]Okay.
[227:48.69]Just joined the stream.
[227:49.31]Is the game any good?
[227:51.22]I would say at this point I have 6-12, just under 15-20 hours in the game.
[228:01.87]I've only streamed it.
[228:02.99]I've only played it on stream.
[228:05.91]I would say, if you'd like an honest opinion, it feels like Shadow of Mordor 1.5.
[228:14.08]This is the game that they probably wanted to make.
[228:20.13]Back when Shadow of Mordor came out.
[228:22.01]They made the foundation.
[228:22.99]They laid it down.
[228:23.67]And... It's great.
[228:28.45]It's fun.
[228:28.95]If you really liked Shadow of Mordor, there's no reason why you're not going to like this one.
[228:34.82]And I'm going to bring a bodyguard to you.
[228:36.56]I will.
[228:37.74]Good call.
[228:38.22]Thanks for the reminder.
[228:43.70]There's fast travel over there.
[228:44.82]It's 10 feet away.
[228:52.75]If you avoid the controversies that this game stirred up... Like, let's say, like, some guy just got out of, like, a time machine.
[229:00.27]So somebody just, somebody played Shadow of Mordor, and they loved it.
[229:03.96]And they said, I don't want to live in a world where I don't play a Shadow of Mordor game.
[229:08.72]Wake me up when this fucking sequel comes out.
[229:10.92]And they lock themselves in a cryogenically frozen chamber.
[229:14.30]And then somebody wakes him up when the game releases.
[229:16.84]And they get the fucking game in their hands.
[229:18.44]Holy shit, I love it.
[229:20.28]They didn't see all the posts about the microtransactions.
[229:22.85]They don't even know what that is.
[229:24.91]They've been asleep for three years.
[229:25.97]They don't know what microtransactions are.
[229:27.63]This is 2017 now, you know?
[229:28.23]Let's get down there.
[229:40.99]controversies.
[229:41.99]This game, if you don't know, has loot boxes that you pay for.
[229:46.25]I don't think you have to, I mean, I guess you can earn in-game currency, but it's a single-player $60 game with purchasable loot boxes that make the game much easier and much better and not as hard.
[229:59.66]This game's not hard by any stretch, by any bounds, you know.
[230:05.06]But they added microtransactions deeply rooted into the game's core mechanics.
[230:14.88]I want this guy.
[230:16.18]Will you guys stop doing your dumb mission?
[230:18.53]What mission are you on?
[230:19.33]I need a bodyguard.
[230:25.13]You.
[230:27.95]Actually, this guy's a good bodyguard.
[230:29.07]The guy with the shield.
[230:33.19]Alright.
[230:37.05]Siege upgrades.
[230:37.96]Assault Leader!
[230:42.92]I definitely want you as an assault leader.
[230:46.98]Mounted cavalry.
[230:48.22]I want you to come in with the big guys.
[230:49.46]Because you're a big guy yourself.
[230:50.82]Why wouldn't you?
[230:53.38]Another assault leader.
[230:54.26]Who else do we want?
[230:57.10]This guy's epic.
[230:59.04]I don't want someone level 19.
[231:00.60]Yeah, this guy for sure.
[231:02.54]Rug.
[231:07.21]And you should pop in there with a bunch of hunters.
[231:11.33]Because you are a hunter.
[231:16.53]This looks much more extensive.
[231:19.93]I can have four people here, huh?
[231:22.87]Damn.
[231:26.82]Looks like I've already got these people.
[231:28.84]21 warmonger or a... No, they're both warmongers, so never mind.
[231:37.00]Well, that guy's my bodyguard, so I'll do this guy.
[231:40.65]And come on.
[231:41.71]Ooh!
[231:41.89]Ooh!
[231:44.93]You can come in here with a Drake.
[231:46.09]You can come in with... Come in with a fucking Grog.
[231:54.00]181 to 206.
[231:54.24]This is still very doable.
[231:58.12]This is definitely possible.
[232:01.42]We're a little bit of an underdog, but it doesn't matter.
[232:03.02]We're fine.
[232:07.66]Let's go for it.
[232:08.18]Let me just look at my inventory for a sec.
[232:11.77]One sec. 56...
[232:15.17]No, none of these are any... These aren't better.
[232:18.95]Break them down!
[232:26.42]That's better.
[232:27.16]376.
[232:27.18]Yeah, break these down.
[232:32.78]Stealth kill a captain.
[232:40.12]You don't really have to buy any boxes.
[232:42.20]Yeah, I mean, you don't have to.
[232:45.66]Nowhere is it necessary that... I forgot an upgrade.
[232:49.24]Oh, shit.
[232:50.24]Thanks for reminding me.
[232:53.74]It's optional stuff, but in a game that has loot and gear and you can buy followers, right?
[232:59.57]What can I upgrade?
[233:03.21]There it is.
[233:06.93]You know, I guess in a world where you have to make a team of orcs to storm a castle, if you can, like, buy orcs, it seems a little, just a little strange.
[233:21.53]I have gems to upgrade, too.
[233:22.81]There we go.
[233:31.33]This one is 36% chance to recover all health from killing a captain.
[233:38.42]This is actually good to have on right now.
[233:42.19]50% increased damage by Uruk allies.
[233:44.35]I feel like I want to put that on.
[233:49.33]In fact, I'm going to put that on.
[233:51.37]Alright, let's combine gems.
[233:56.98]I can make one of these.
[234:06.52]Very nice.
[234:07.22]I can make another one.
[234:13.85]Diablo II gem crafting at its finest, ladies and gentlemen.
[234:18.57]Alright, let's take a look.
[234:19.39]So, I want this to be this.
[234:22.75]20% more damage.
[234:25.43]I want this one to be this.
[234:26.36]I mean, this is just health... health stolen with this weapon.
[234:34.96]That's cool.
[234:36.20]That one's already in there.
[234:37.74]So is this one.
[234:39.44]Although, hold on a second.
[234:41.16]Max health or damage...
[234:45.68]Keep the max health in there.
[234:47.88]I will take off this little shitty crunchy one.
[234:51.78]Alright.
[234:56.71]I am ready.
[234:58.37]It's time to siege.
[235:07.79]Okay.
[235:08.63]Poisonous siege beasts.
[235:10.27]Fiery siege beasts.
[235:11.55]Or cursed siege.
[235:12.77]Let's go.
[235:14.43]Fire is out.
[235:15.17]No, no fire.
[235:16.35]No fire.
[235:16.99]Causes problems.
[235:18.23]Poison.
[235:23.36]Alright.
[235:25.88]Let's do it.
[235:26.30]It's time to siege the castle.
[235:37.72]Fire got an upgrade?
[235:39.98]You can get more.
[235:40.70]We need to get more.
[235:46.12]You can get more than one?
[235:47.47]You can only activate one, I thought.
[235:52.29]You can get them all.
[235:53.01]I thought only one could be activated.
[235:54.65]Yeah, see?
[235:58.59]Upgrade is active.
[235:59.33]Upgrade is inactive.
[236:01.45]You can only have one.
[236:06.54]Fiery Cursed.
[236:11.34]Actually, no.
[236:11.64]I'm going to stay with Poison.
[236:15.25]Get a bit of Captain.
[236:17.31]I mean, I don't have anybody.
[236:22.74]I'm fine.
[236:23.20]Remember, I got inside men.
[236:25.28]I got some inside men, guys.
[236:29.96]Get the third upgrade.
[236:33.66]What do you mean, the third upgrade?
[236:40.49]Alright, let's do it.
[236:44.89]Take it on.
[236:45.29]The drake isn't very good.
[236:50.12]The drake feels like really clunky.
[237:00.58]This is not going to be that hard.
[237:01.79]I got like four people on the inside already.
[237:09.05]Level 206.
[237:10.17]We're like 190 something.
[237:11.45]Who is the lord commander?
[237:15.77]is...
[237:16.67]Kingslayer!
[237:17.39]Oh shit, he's over 40.
[237:18.41]Rashed Kingslayer.
[237:19.39]What if the mouth on the top of his head was the one moving, the lips were moving?
[237:47.61]He knows what Jeremy means.
[237:50.04]Three, two, one.
[237:51.48]Go!
[238:18.92]Hey!
[238:19.54]You!
[238:21.02]Up there!
[238:24.16]Apparently you're too far away.
[238:29.14]Get in there!
[238:34.79]And siege!
[238:38.79]Oh shit, somebody's already dead!
[238:40.81]Not on my watch.
[238:44.15]Come back to me.
[238:46.55]Capture it.
[238:47.75]First point is ours.
[238:51.29]Just watch out when I do that.
[238:54.92]He's one of my inside men.
[239:03.06]And the next capture point.
[239:06.22]He's dead again.
[239:07.48]What is killing you guys?
[239:08.36]What's wrong with you guys?
[239:09.24]Come on, get with it.
[239:13.79]Snap out of it, man.
[239:14.71]Let's go.
[239:16.69]Just frozen.
[239:17.61]Shit.
[239:28.56]Damn, man, like, my... Are these guys really getting that fucking... Are they getting their ass kicked that much?
[239:35.77]No, I want to revive him.
[239:37.55]I wish there was a different button.
[239:38.43]One of my only complaints about the Mordor games is that, like, there's like five different tasks that are on each button.
[239:48.42]Be it... Be it dodge.
[239:50.22]Be it hit.
[239:51.16]Be it attack.
[239:52.20]Be it, like... Hold it for a second.
[239:53.56]Hold it for two seconds.
[239:54.50]Don't hold it for that long.
[239:56.87]I just wish there wasn't as much.
[240:04.42]There he is.
[240:05.66]Mm-hmm.
[240:07.04]Into the training.
[240:10.64]They don't even have any enemies.
[240:15.82]Where are all their fucking... Oh, there they are.
[240:17.80]Alright.
[240:21.20]You're telling me I hit that guy, but not this one?
[240:28.80]Let's get in there.
[240:29.26]This is where the real fight begins.
[240:30.28]That guy's level 37.
[240:32.67]Holy shit.
[240:33.29]Our Pratu pain lover.
[240:35.93]No, this is not going to be good.
[240:39.45]No!
[240:54.12]Possessive Master.
[240:55.90]Alright, I gotta get rid of this guy to go to the Barn Arrow right now.
[240:58.98]Holy shit!
[240:59.60]Pin him!
[241:00.28]I can't pin him.
[241:01.24]Come here.
[241:26.47]Oh, come on.
[241:27.07]Right when it fucking dropped.
[241:28.63]Where's my... Where am I?
[241:33.11]Capture it.
[241:34.27]Put the knife down.
[241:34.97]Put the knife down.
[241:36.31]Yes.
[241:41.86]Wow.
[241:43.42]Whoa.
[241:44.84]Whoa.
[241:46.98]Oh, my God.
[241:49.06]No, not like this.
[241:50.18]Don't end it like this.
[242:05.73]Get up, you fool.
[242:14.21]Come here.
[242:14.95]Give me your life force.
[242:17.61]You don't need it anymore.
[242:18.41]Alright, let's get up.
[242:22.59]Come on, come on, come on.
[242:23.61]I'm the quarterback and my fucking whole team is on the fucking goal line.
[242:27.50]Get over there.
[242:28.04]Alright, well, he's got poison somehow.
[242:32.50]Good.
[242:34.30]Somebody said, somebody said poisoning wasn't good.
[242:38.34]I'm taking my sweet ass time getting there.
[242:40.22]Alright, here we go.
[242:46.52]Nice job, Beastmaster.
[242:49.03]Get in, piss in his face.
[242:50.01]Take a look at that, rug the shadow.
[242:54.61]Good job, boys.
[242:55.47]I'm just looking down from above.
[242:56.89]My real-time strategy game is going well.
[243:03.52]Shit.
[243:03.98]14 level difference and he still did it well.
[243:08.18]Alright, we're good.
[243:08.80]Tap it.
[243:09.12]Now it's just the guy inside.
[243:28.10]That guy's the warchief, by the way.
[243:34.65]The actual warchief.
[243:35.75]The overlord.
[243:36.37]What was his name?
[243:37.03]Forget the hood.
[243:41.27]The captain.
[243:41.83]This always seems to happen.
[243:45.43]Somebody gets scared.
[243:47.53]Right at the end.
[243:48.03]No, no.
[243:48.75]I don't want to drain you.
[243:49.59]I want to revive him.
[243:52.81]Let's take these guys.
[243:55.83]Pick up the items.
[244:01.11]Stay and fight.
[244:11.53]Cannot recruit.
[244:12.43]Oh.
[244:16.29]Then get up and fucking meet your maker.
[244:24.34]I should have known better than to betray you, boss.
[244:31.26]Yeah.
[244:32.28]Well, let this be a lesson for you.
[244:40.41]Wait, he betrayed me!
[244:43.07]He did?
[244:43.47]Hold on, wait, what just happened there?
[244:45.87]What happened?
[244:47.93]Hold on.
[244:52.05]Wasn't that guy on... I don't understand what's going on here.
[244:57.25]I'm confused.
[245:00.87]Who is this?
[245:12.48]So, wait a minute.
[245:13.26]Who was the guy that shot the dude in the face?
[245:15.62]It was this guy, right?
[245:18.44]No, it wasn't.
[245:18.94]It was you.
[245:22.06]Okay.
[245:24.85]Make sure I'm all ready to do this.
[245:26.53]Let's go and let's fight the master.
[245:31.11]I killed a blood brother.
[245:32.29]Oh.
[245:34.21]Rugshot him.
[245:36.99]Alright, don't get cocky yet.
[245:37.97]I still have to beat the boss.
[245:40.74]Still have to go in the chamber.
[245:48.41]Like the god emperor.
[245:50.47]Look at all this gold.
[245:59.22]This is not good.
[246:04.62]We're gonna lose.
[246:11.22]12 levels too... 14 levels too low for this.
[246:13.28]He's a legendary level 40 with a crossbow.
[246:16.97]That's legit my nemesis.
[246:18.59]And he's got a fake Edward Elric hand.
[246:21.97]Great.
[246:25.01]Bring in my bodyguard.
[246:27.19]Alright, let's go, buddy.
[246:30.45]It's alright, just wait for it.
[246:32.11]This guy's gotta go first.
[246:39.11]No!
[246:39.43]God damn it!
[246:41.67]I'm panicking.
[246:45.37]No, don't get on the fucking horse!
[246:47.51]Oh my god, you fucking idiot.
[246:49.61]Why?
[246:50.41]Same goddamn button.
[246:51.83]That's what I was talking about.
[246:53.57]Same button to get on the horse, to get on the guy's back.
[247:06.05]Clear him out.
[247:11.49]What are you doing?
[247:17.49]I'm so glad this guy is just eating bullets for me.
[247:26.88]He's just standing there just...
[247:45.69]Be a good boy.
[247:46.87]Who's shooting?
[247:47.61]You are.
[247:55.41]Immune to execution.
[247:56.55]Oh, that's fucking fantastic.
[248:04.18]He's a vault breaker as well.
[248:05.70]Oh, that's great.
[248:06.50]And let me guess.
[248:08.04]I can't shoot him in the head.
[248:09.80]I can shoot him in the head.
[248:17.45]My guy is doing work right now.
[248:22.89]Got it!
[248:23.19]Don't.
[248:23.53]Let.
[248:23.77]Him.
[248:24.11]Get.
[248:24.93]Away.
[248:25.15]No!
[248:25.51]Fuck!
[248:41.97]Don't you fucking dare, man.
[248:45.08]What was that little skip?
[248:46.10]What is he doing?
[248:48.92]He's immune to executions.
[248:53.05]He's just skipping along, having a grand old time.
[249:00.15]He's broken, I know, but I want to kill him.
[249:03.99]Wait, hold on.
[249:07.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[249:10.06]Oh, you fucking idiots.
[249:12.04]Let me just do this.
[249:14.20]God damn it.
[249:18.00]Oh, would you just kill him?
[249:21.38]Just stick the sword in his face, please.
[249:24.50]Just, he's dead.
[249:26.24]Like, the fort is mine.
[249:30.25]Let me please just put my hands down your face.
[249:36.39]See you later.
[249:43.19]This is gonna be a tough decision, considering... I mean, he did a really good job.
[249:51.48]Like, he did a fucking fantastic job, the guy that was in there with me.
[249:55.12]He ate so many bullets.
[249:57.08]Without him, I'm not sure if it was a victory or not.
[250:00.99]You know what I'm saying?
[250:05.15]We're going to have to do a toss of a coin here.
[250:08.92]Rug or the dude that was inside of me.
[250:16.08]I love how I'm determining what leadership is by how many bullets you can take.
[250:20.18]Oh yeah, he took so many arrows.
[250:21.40]What a leader.
[250:34.76]Smash Now put his head on your head for the triple head combo It's the second region conquered
[250:52.68]Very cool.
[250:57.82]Alright, here we go.
[250:59.52]Who gets to be Overlord?
[251:03.17]Is it gonna be Horza?
[251:05.61]The Bullet Sponge.
[251:12.01]Or is it gonna be Rug?
[251:14.43]Shoot him in the head, then they're dead.
[251:17.85]I don't care if you're 15 levels higher than me, Rug the Shadow.
[251:22.74]I've seen a lot of rugs here.
[251:24.60]Or should I make the moron?
[251:25.68]Where's the mindless guy?
[251:26.72]Where's the idiot?
[251:31.13]There he is.
[251:31.41]The guy that didn't even participate in the fight.
[251:38.09]Hey, you know the guy that didn't even come to the fight and has the education of a four-year-old?
[251:47.65]Maybe we should make him the fucking overlord.
[251:55.60]Have a vote?
[251:56.16]Alright, let's do a vote.
[251:59.72]And then I'm probably going to take off for the day.
[252:03.02]I'm getting hungry.
[252:05.54]It's been fun, though.
[252:06.64]This game is really, really... I'm having a blast in this game.
[252:12.41]So, let's get a straw poll.
[252:13.85]Who is the... Overlord.
[252:17.71]Overlord.
[252:18.55]Rug?
[252:21.07]Rug?
[252:27.77]Rug is the headshot guy.
[252:31.25]Mindless.
[252:33.15]Or... Bullet sponge.
[252:38.59]Shield.
[252:40.37]Guy.
[252:41.36]What's his name?
[252:42.22]Ronk.
[252:42.64]No, what's the... Whatever.
[252:45.06]Bullet sponge.
[252:45.60]You guys know who I'm talking about.
[252:46.64]They're all the same fucking 18 names randomly generated.
[252:53.30]Okay, so here you go.
[252:58.42]Go ahead and vote.
[253:00.10]You got like 30 seconds to cast your vote.
[253:10.07]Looks like Rug is owning these polls right now.
[253:15.49]Although I'm surprised how many people are voting for Mindless.
[253:21.77]What would his speech be when he comes out?
[253:29.16]Who was it that did all the work?
[253:31.64]Yeah.
[253:32.68]Well, you could equally say that, um... What's his name over here?
[253:37.87]Wait a minute!
[253:41.09]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[253:42.87]I just clicked back into the game.
[253:44.79]I was alt-tabbed.
[253:47.96]Go back.
[253:52.18]That would have been fucking stupid.
[253:56.38]Alright, thank you for voting.
[253:58.30]50% of the vote.
[254:01.53]We're going to go with Rug the Shadow.
[254:04.09]Because obviously killing that 37 was pretty key.
[254:09.17]Rug the Shadow.
[254:12.91]Welcome to your new castle.
[254:21.53]That would have been funny.
[254:22.19]Yeah, that would have been funny.
[254:26.13]Wow, y'all just hate fun, don't you?
[254:31.89]He would have lost the castle in, like, two days.
[254:35.54]Hey, look, I have enough gold for a war chest.
[254:37.66]War chests contain powerful followers, as well as training orders to upgrade your followers.
[254:42.48]So, there we go.
[254:44.56]Our first pay-to-get box.
[254:48.44]Poisonous war chest, assassin war chest.
[254:52.33]Oh, man.
[254:53.01]I mean, like... I can get two.
[254:55.61]Two.
[254:57.03]Three orc assassins.
[254:58.35]One legendary.
[254:59.09]One epic.
[255:02.49]I mean, I can get one of these.
[255:03.89]This is consumables.
[255:05.77]Loot chests.
[255:07.46]Three pieces of gear.
[255:08.46]Alright, let's get a reinforced olog war chest.
[255:17.80]Buy it.
[255:19.38]What's in it?
[255:22.55]Alright, we got...
[255:28.80]Skak the Unbreakable.
[255:32.98]Luga Learned Scribe.
[255:34.61]He's a mystic.
[255:35.37]I think those are the guys that can teleport.
[255:37.23]And... A legendary terror berserker, Arcus the Giant.
[255:45.32]So as you can see, the game is based on followers.
[255:49.28]And here are a bunch of ridiculous ones out of a box.
[255:57.06]So that means I have enough to do.
[255:58.12]I can do one more of these or I can get some items.
[256:00.89]Let's do... I have enough to do one more.
[256:05.33]I don't want poisonous orcs.
[256:10.23]I want some assassins.
[256:16.20]Alright.
[256:21.26]If you wonder what these things are, you can upgrade your followers.
[256:23.65]You can give them weapons.
[256:25.81]Give them better stuff.
[256:26.63]Better boosts and everything.
[256:28.55]So this is Rash the Ruinous.
[256:30.07]He's a marauder.
[256:33.19]Bolg the Knower.
[256:34.41]Fiery machine assassin.
[256:39.64]Looks a little unsure of himself.
[256:40.90]That's fine.
[256:42.14]And then Gash the Crusher.
[256:43.50]Legendary also.
[256:45.46]Rash, Rug, and Ronk.
[256:48.82]Lots of R names.
[256:52.22]None of the Rash.
[256:53.50]Well, come on.
[256:54.18]Like, Rash...
[256:55.73]This rash is probably like John.
[256:58.59]How many Johns do you know?
[257:00.53]I know at least three.
[257:03.73]Rug is like David.
[257:09.18]Alright.
[257:12.62]Let's go to my inventory.
[257:14.08]Just take a final look here at some of the stuff.
[257:19.36]This is better.
[257:24.24]So is this.
[257:32.15]And this can be upgraded.
[257:36.36]50% increased damage dealt by allies to enemies that are on fire.
[257:39.62]Well, that's good.
[257:43.82]Alright.
[257:44.46]I thought that was... Look at this guy.
[257:45.92]I thought that was me.
[257:47.96]I was like, that's not me.
[257:50.72]Two skill points.
[257:52.24]And then I'm going to wrap it up here for today.
[257:56.11]I will probably be streaming tomorrow.
[257:59.77]There's enough people here.
[258:00.59]There's actually a lot of people here.
[258:06.47]Well, this is over 3,000 fucking people here.
[258:09.63]Wow.
[258:12.11]So, well, now that I got a lot of you here, let's talk about the next week.
[258:17.28]TwitchCon is coming up this next weekend.
[258:19.88]So, I'm not going to be here.
[258:24.25]There's going to be three streams Tuesday, not Tuesday, sorry, Thursday, Friday and Tuesday after the weekend.
[258:31.73]I'm not going to be streaming because I'm going to be in Long Beach.
[258:37.07]So I'm trying to do a thing where I go, you know, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, like Tuesday into Wednesday.
[258:44.97]So I can essentially make up the three streams.
[258:47.25]I'm not doing this coming weekend coming up next weekend.
[258:54.12]So, uh, expect another at least two or three streams in a row here.
[258:59.54]With maybe, like I might not stream tomorrow, but you will see like a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[259:05.56]Or like a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[259:07.72]Let's try to go as many days as we can in a row.
[259:13.80]We have a lot of games to play.
[259:15.46]I'm currently like addicted to this.
[259:17.93]But there's a lot of PlayStation 3 dumb shit to play.
[259:21.67]I'm sure we'll get through some of it over the next few days.
[259:25.27]But, thanks everybody for sticking around.
[259:30.53]Trying to do some more EU-friendly things.
[259:33.82]And there are a lot of people here, so this is... I would definitely do it again.
[259:38.98]So, thanks everybody for watching.
[259:41.04]Let's go over some bits before we go.
[259:43.06]As always, thank you for any amount of money.
[259:45.68]All the subs or resubs, whatever.
[259:48.60]Bits.
[259:49.76]You guys spoil the shit out of me all the time.
[259:52.89]Like I tend to say.
[259:56.45]That's not a BRB.
[259:57.75]We're going away.
[259:58.43]We're leaving.
[259:59.11]We're going to bed.
[260:00.49]Not bed, but eat.
[260:03.27]Thank you, Mr. Scruffington, for the 15 bucks.
[260:06.93]Hi, Jerb.
[260:07.25]I've been watching all your stuff since your early days of TF2.
[260:09.84]With all the countless hours of entertainment you've provided me, you more than deserve this, you splendid shpee.
[260:16.78]Thank you for the 15 dollars, dude.
[260:18.18]Very generous of you.
[260:21.32]Much appreciate that.
[260:22.78]You've been around for a long time.
[260:25.03]That's nearly, like, five to six years ago now.
[260:28.71]God, it feels like yesterday.
[260:29.83]I feel like I was just making those videos.
[260:33.85]Time shoots by out of a cannon.
[260:36.73]It really does.
[260:37.23]Uh, but thank you.
[260:41.98]Erakin, or Era-K-Y.
[260:44.68]Thank you for the five dollars.
[260:47.19]Couldn't stay for the whole stream, but thanks for helping me through.
[260:49.41]Thanks for helping me get through the morning, dude.
[260:53.19]Love you.
[260:53.65]Well, if you're still here, thank you for the $5.
[260:55.55]Appreciate it.
[260:57.71]Also, Darkstar gave $1.
[260:59.09]What the butt, Jeremy?
[261:00.39]I'm not an EU.
[261:01.43]I can't be up this early.
[261:04.85]I'm not an EU.
[261:08.80]Neither am I. But thank you, Darkstar.
[261:14.46]Uh, and I think I'm all caught up.
[261:16.35]Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything from before.
[261:19.35]Never Trust a Purple obviously gave, Purple gave like fucking more than like a hundred something dollars tonight, today, this morning.
[261:36.09]Yeah, you guys, thank you so much.
[261:39.25]I will probably see you tomorrow.
[261:42.23]And there's no schedule.
[261:43.59]Obviously, my schedule is Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[261:46.29]So, Sunday, Monday, the next two days.
[261:49.45]I'm just gonna gauge whether or not if I want to do it or not.
[261:53.31]It will happen either Sunday or Monday.
[261:54.89]I don't have, like, a time frame for you, though.
[262:01.31]And I will see you guys soon.
[262:02.51]Take care, everybody.
[262:03.61]Have a good rest of your day.
[262:04.83]Much love.
[262:07.09]And have a good night.
[262:08.99]I'm so used to saying goodnight because I stream at 7pm Eastern.
[262:12.48]Have a good day.
[262:14.59]The night is young.
[262:16.55]Goodbye.
[263:00.74]Thank you.
