[00:00.78]Hello.
[00:01.36]Hi, everybody.
[00:06.74]How y'all doing?
[00:11.60]I'm doing good.
[00:13.71]I'm a little tired, but that's because I just got back from the East Coast.
[00:19.97]My plane actually landed really late.
[00:23.51]So I got in late, late, late, late last night, early, early, early this morning.
[00:29.21]And I'm a little fucking zonked
[00:32.17]But, uh, we're gonna do, we're gonna hang out, we're just gonna chill.
[00:38.71]And I may as well have taken a hot air balloon.
[00:40.21]Uh, we're gonna play Planet Zoo.
[00:51.77]While I- what the f- come here.
[00:56.13]No, no.
[00:56.31]Those are two very distinct dings.
[01:00.07]I don't even know how I made those sounds.
[01:06.39]I must have smiled twice.
[01:09.16]Now, I hope you enjoyed the Halloween stream.
[01:10.46]Hope you had a safe, fun Halloween.
[01:13.10]After the Halloween stream, I ended up staying down there for a little while.
[01:17.60]Get some stuff situated with my family and see some friends.
[01:23.09]And I just got back.
[01:25.25]I just, I literally ran here from getting out of the plane.
[01:29.87]Hey, Great Canadian FK Club, thanks for the five community subs.
[01:33.56]Thank you.
[01:36.28]Let us observe the animals.
[01:37.20]That's what we're going to do.
[01:39.54]Is this a long tutorial incoming?
[01:41.10]That's okay.
[01:43.12]Guys, it's a long tutorial.
[01:44.82]Alright, sorry.
[01:46.10]A sim just yelled at me.
[01:48.11]Let me put the audio on so you know what I'm talking about.
[01:49.75]This is a long tutorial kind of day.
[01:55.59]So, you know.
[01:56.63]We do what we're going to do.
[02:01.43]Don't abandon Bugleberry.
[02:04.23]But why would I?
[02:08.36]Why would I?
[02:08.86]He just had like five times reverb.
[02:15.45]I didn't even know.
[02:16.37]I didn't know that I had that much reverb on until I watched the stream like two days later.
[02:23.93]I was laughing so hard.
[02:25.25]It was so much.
[02:31.46]You could like barely hear what I was saying.
[02:39.43]Oh, I guess like the reverb was going on top of the reverb.
[02:42.05]Okay, when I first watched it, I was like, oh, I did that.
[02:44.66]Maybe it like gets fixed.
[02:46.02]Maybe they like dropped the audio, like the reverb a little.
[02:49.26]No, it got like worse.
[02:52.62]I screamed.
[02:54.22]Oh, I didn't do anything.
[02:56.20]Right?
[02:56.82]This is somebody else doing this.
[03:01.90]Oh.
[03:04.64]Man, it was so loud.
[03:07.25]I didn't know it was going to be that loud.
[03:12.24]Hey, Bugaberry's pretty good at pottery, don't you think?
[03:14.30]What do you mean, no?
[03:22.26]What do you mean, no?
[03:25.06]What did the doctor have to tell you guys?
[03:26.67]Oh, that I was full of shit.
[03:28.83]That's what he said, and he stormed out.
[03:38.39]Yep.
[03:40.57]Come on, Dr. Schmoikson was back.
[03:43.20]That was a ton of fun.
[03:44.04]I was so glad to see Dr. Schmoikson again.
[03:49.69]Literally full of shit.
[03:51.87]Is that the same?
[03:52.61]Yeah, that's the same person, yeah.
[03:59.00]What a legendary doctor.
[04:04.46]Haunted noises.
[04:06.89]Jeremiah, I joined when you had a diaper on.
[04:08.63]Oh, yeah, let me talk about the diaper for a second.
[04:11.80]Alright, shut up, Sim.
[04:15.46]I was lying in bed in the... I was in a hotel, right?
[04:20.26]I'm lying in bed after that stream.
[04:22.84]And somebody... There's like three or four photos that I saw of like zoomed in diaper, full diaper.
[04:30.71]And I put my iPad down.
[04:32.61]And I rested my head on the back of the pillow.
[04:35.63]And I said...
[04:37.53]Was that a mistake to do that?
[04:40.67]No.
[04:41.79]It was, it was.
[04:42.37]It wasn't it?
[04:48.52]I had this, like, weird, not, okay, look, let me, I don't, like, care about any of that shit, right?
[04:54.60]Like, I don't, I'm not, like, embarrassed by anything really anymore, right?
[04:58.96]But, I don't know why, but for, like, ten seconds, I was sitting there going, I was in, like, a diaper on stream and shit, like, that, I don't know if I should have done that, it's weird.
[05:09.09]But, no, it's okay.
[05:11.31]You know, if I get embarrassed for five seconds, you know that it was embarrassing.
[05:16.33]Your next employer will see it.
[05:20.30]Let's hope they think it's funny I gave you guys shit for like saying like bald on stream Imagine imagine the person saying that to you that then filled a diaper with slime on themselves The person that's hiring that sees that They might not even let me in the building
[05:50.47]Alright.
[05:52.41]But yes, I'm back.
[05:53.91]Here's the plan for this week.
[05:55.91]We actually got... We got... You don't think I'm going to step on the brakes?
[06:00.51]No, step on the gas.
[06:01.73]So today we're going to do Planet Zoo.
[06:05.30]Tomorrow, it depends on how fun Planet Zoo is.
[06:07.34]You know, if I'm like, you know, let's do it again tomorrow, we'll do it tomorrow.
[06:11.14]And then later this week we're going to do Dead Rising 1.
[06:14.21]Beat Dead Rising 1.
[06:16.55]And then we're gonna do Community Content Night next week.
[06:20.70]Like, probably, uh... Like, yeah, probably like seven or eight days from now.
[06:25.68]And then... Five or six days later, somewhere over... Probably like next weekend, or the weekend after that, we're doing green screen DLC for free.
[06:34.81]Volume 2.
[06:35.11]So... Mm-hmm.
[06:42.34]So I will open up a new Discord channel.
[06:44.08]We will do suggestions.
[06:45.58]We will vote on responses and things you want me to do.
[06:48.08]In front of the green screen again.
[06:49.07]And we'll make a day out of it, you know?
[06:55.51]But it's good to be back.
[06:56.61]I've taken a lot of planes recently.
[06:58.63]I've been going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[07:01.29]The last couple of months, so... It's good that I'm gonna be... My feet will be cemented in the ground here for at least another... Another month or two, I think.
[07:09.10]We'll see.
[07:11.84]Depends on what happens.
[07:14.08]But, why don't we move over here?
[07:15.48]We got, uh... We currently have... This is our avatar.
[07:20.43]I didn't know that you actually did that.
[07:21.67]I just did it.
[07:22.11]I don't care.
[07:22.47]It doesn't need to be anything.
[07:23.87]This is my avatar.
[07:27.83]I mean, I would wear this... I think I wear this exact outfit all the time, actually.
[07:36.90]Now we go from here.
[07:37.62]This is Planet Zoo.
[07:38.34]Place your avatar HQ.
[07:40.76]The HQ is where other players will see your avatar and access any zoos or blueprints you have shared.
[07:45.14]This is like the Mii Plaza.
[07:48.56]Position your avatar anywhere on the globe.
[07:50.00]You can edit your avatar HQ position later.
[07:53.20]Oh, but what do I do?
[07:55.50]Do I do, like, Boston?
[07:57.02]Or do I do Vegas?
[07:59.99]Uh-oh.
[08:01.15]Should I just do it in the ocean?
[08:05.80]Brazil?
[08:07.60]Why would I do Brazil?
[08:11.81]What about like... No, this is like the funny way to do this.
[08:14.93]Like, oh, I'm gonna do it in Russia somewhere.
[08:21.81]Can I zoom in?
[08:23.39]No, I can't even zoom in.
[08:25.97]No, this is probably gonna fuck up my ping if I do this.
[08:28.03]It's gonna connect me to like European servers.
[08:30.95]Alright, how about just somewhere over here in like Florida?
[08:40.46]Should I do?
[08:40.96]No.
[08:41.30]That's not where I live.
[08:43.20]Should I do like... Alright.
[08:49.72]I made my decision.
[08:56.12]Career.
[08:56.56]Eye of the tiger.
[08:57.42]Alright guys.
[08:57.92]I hope you're ready for a tutorial stream.
[09:03.35]Because I'm... That's what I want to do.
[09:08.31]Career Franchise Challenge Sandbox.
[09:11.99]Five days left for Eye of the Tiger.

[09:36.16]Is like the Earth under attack?
[09:39.24]Okay, so let's do the good one house.
[09:42.10]That's where we're going.
[09:42.78]Okay.
[09:46.62]What is this game?
[09:47.22]This is... You make your own zoo.
[09:51.46]Tutorial.
[09:52.36]Alright.
[09:53.86]Renovated and renamed after... What is this?
[09:56.12]Lore.
[09:56.44]Somebody can read the lore.
[09:58.96]Wait.
[10:00.44]update hold on I have to I have to read this actually I'm not going to skip the tutorials okay renovated and renamed after its purchase by bernard goodwin in the 1980s goodwin house has since become one of the most respected zoos in the country more recently has undergone a further renovation to update many of the habitats and facilities but due to various issues the work hasn't been completed which is where you come in I'm ready um
[10:27.81]I'm excited.
[10:28.69]I am calm excited.
[10:30.71]You know what I mean?
[10:41.01]What's with this loading screen?
[10:44.52]Two mega lull tutorial lull.
[10:50.80]I couldn't even.
[10:56.65]No, I'm not just gonna burn through the whole thing.
[10:58.60]I need to know how to play.
[11:01.41]I was actually kind of excited for this game.
[11:09.04]Oh, sorry about that.
[11:10.36]I have a habit of slipping back into the Planko language.
[11:15.24]Okay.
[11:16.06]It's good to finally meet you in person.
[11:18.94]I'm Bernard, although I insist you call me Bernie.
[11:23.13]The only person who calls me Bernard is my wife.
[11:26.33]And even then, only when I've tracked elephant dung into the carpets.
[11:30.47]Wait, we throw... Oh.
[11:31.93]Why would you have that?
[11:34.07]This is so cool.
[11:34.58]Look at this.
[11:50.61]but we're in the middle of a big renovation and that's where you come in sadly our old contractor had to retire after developing a fur allergy peacock poor devil kept sneezing his dentures into the lion habitat so it's up to you to finish everything off
[12:08.75]Don't worry though.
[12:10.09]I'm not completely throwing you into the deep end my head keeper and Nancy Jones will be lending a helping hand Did you see that jump you to be too, but I'm sure that was a fucking fire even better One that isn't on fire less shouting that way
[12:33.14]OK.
[12:34.57]Renovated from that rosy, fresh face of yours, I'm guessing you're Bernie's new hire.
[12:40.83]Good.
[12:41.33]Now, I hope you're ready to ditch your diploma because we're about to get really hands-on.
[12:46.06]Okay.
[12:46.68]But before we begin the real work, how about we familiarize you with the zoo by learning how to fly around it and visiting some of our beautiful animals?
[12:55.81]Okay, well, I just have a tutorial.
[12:56.65]We'll start by popping over and having a look-see at the grizzly bears in their habitat.
[12:59.83]Okay, go to the grizzly bear habitat.
[13:01.37]Enter the grizzly bear animal habitat camera.
[13:04.51]Locate the West African lion habitat.
[13:06.47]Locate the empty habitat.
[13:07.48]Alright, well, I just have my controls on the screen.
[13:08.96]Why don't you take them away from me?
[13:12.21]Alright, find the grizzly bear habitat.
[13:13.50]Okay, it's right click.
[13:19.26]How do I pitch?
[13:20.78]There we go.
[13:21.64]Alright, find the grizzly bear habitat.
[13:24.73]Oh, I see it!
[13:27.07]I don't even want to play, I just want to look at the bear.
[13:31.47]They all have their own information panels?
[13:49.27]Seven years old.
[13:50.57]What?
[13:51.15]Can I jump that?
[13:51.67]Okay, activate the animal camera.
[13:52.89]So this is it here.
[13:53.41]Whoa.
[14:17.19]See now, this is a fantastic way to get a close look at your animals.
[14:21.58]You can also get this view of an animal by simply double-clicking on it.
[14:25.10]Yeah, that's much easier to do.
[14:26.12]Alright, well that's cool.
[14:27.46]Okay, when you're ready, let's pop over to the other side of the zoo and take a look at the lions.
[14:31.26]Wait, is he going to take a bath?
[14:32.18]I've marked their location for you to find.
[14:34.31]Do you get to watch them eat?
[14:48.19]I don't even care.
[14:49.08]I just want to watch.
[14:49.64]Okay.
[14:51.94]What's he doing with his bum?
[14:52.74]Alright.
[14:55.80]Let's go back.
[14:56.20]Okay.
[14:57.16]Into the grizzly bear.
[14:58.08]What is he doing?
[14:59.68]Oh, shit.
[15:03.47]Okay.
[15:04.03]Locate the West African lion habitat.
[15:05.41]Okay.
[15:06.87]Let's get out of here, right?
[15:10.97]West African lion habitat.
[15:14.28]Where is it?
[15:15.58]Over here.
[15:18.17]Pantera, Leo, Leo.
[15:20.27]All the West African lion to you and me.
[15:22.17]Where is he?
[15:22.83]Oh, there you are.
[15:23.23]Lions are the most social for big cats, and there can be as many as 40 lions in a pride.
[15:28.31]Although prides of that size are pretty rare.
[15:30.23]As Bernie would say, those lions are rawsome.
[15:34.83]Which is precisely why I handle the training instead these days.
[15:38.56]What is that?
[15:39.08]Anyway, how about we get started on those objectives?
[15:41.76]They have like a little, like a piñata in here?
[15:43.56]Do you want to pick up the coin?
[15:50.52]Piñata enrichment.
[15:52.68]What?
[15:54.94]Oh, it is a piñata.
[15:56.77]Why are the pinatas in here?
[15:59.43]Okay, locate the empty habitat.
[16:02.09]Okay, what do we got?
[16:06.02]Empty habitat.
[16:07.94]This way.
[16:09.08]My first animal.
[16:09.82]I can't wait.
[16:10.58]It's going to be a kangaroo.
[16:11.50]No, it's going to be an armadillo.
[16:12.58]No, it's going to be a raccoon.
[16:14.56]I want two raccoons.
[16:21.26]right I got it it's right here right as you can see it's a lovely space for animals but it's missing a certain something beavers two some things warthogs so I'd like you to adopt a pair of them to adopt animals we need to open the animal market which is in the animal trading section people watching right now okay um animal trading
[16:45.70]Warthog, okay, so we got... What's wrong with that?
[16:48.18]Okay, well, I'm being drip-fed content, because the game knows that I would just click this button a thousand times and then have to restart the tutorial.
[17:13.40]So it's size, longevity, fertility.
[17:16.78]Alright, let's get one.
[17:19.22]So just send to zoo.
[17:20.22]Waiting in the trade center.
[17:22.88]Send to zoo.
[17:26.42]Delivery scheduled.
[17:30.22]How many do I need?
[17:30.72]Two?
[17:32.42]when you adopt an animal it's automatically placed in the trade center where they're held until you're ready to move them into their habitat which as it happens you are so how about you move them into their new home oh okay animal wait animal storage okay so this is animal market animal storage trade history are these stocks okay so common warthog in trade center move to here
[18:01.82]when you ask for an animal to be moved into a habitat your caretakers will go to the trade center collect your animal and deliver them to your selected habitat I've marked the trade center's location so let's go and watch the caretakers in action oh it already happened okay so animal trading there's a where's the trade center oh okay I got one look it loves its new pen
[18:34.13]No, get out.
[18:35.15]I want to talk.
[18:38.21]I want to get in here.
[18:43.45]Warthogs are fucking ugly.
[18:56.96]What do you mean mean?
[18:59.64]No, I'm sorry.
[19:00.38]Warthog looks like five animals combined.
[19:03.89]Hey!
[19:09.92]What?
[19:10.10]I didn't say I hated it.
[19:11.14]I just said I... I said that Warthog was ugly.
[19:13.72]That doesn't mean I hate the Warthog.
[19:15.44]Okay, so I have one... Okay, I got two in here.
[19:21.34]Now what's the, uh... How do I feed them?
[19:29.59]Animal storage?
[19:30.45]Okay, so I have two in here.
[19:32.43]So what's the next part?
[19:33.37]What do you want me to do?
[19:40.13]How do I feed them?
[19:41.77]Nature.
[19:42.05]Habitat.
[19:42.65]Habitat?
[19:44.35]The tutorial just gave up on me.
[19:49.87]Was I supposed to go to the trade center first?
[19:52.48]I marked it on your map.
[19:54.50]Oh, okay.
[19:54.86]It's over here.
[19:57.77]Well, as you can see, those caretakers don't hang about.
[20:01.45]They'll move those animals to their destination as fast as possible.
[20:05.70]Of course, normally we'd have to place the animals into quarantine before moving them into a habitat, but I am assured by a person of good standing that these warthogs are in the very rudest of health.
[20:17.69]Okay.
[20:18.03]What do they eat?
[20:18.86]I like this one.
[20:19.46]Eat it!
[20:19.96]Eat the hay!
[20:38.89]luckily if you select an animal you'll bring up the animal welfare information panel which we saw earlier where you can see how they're doing that way you'll know exactly what areas need to be addressed but don't worry if that's a lot to remember you can always check the zoopedia for more information are they not supposed to be eating this
[20:59.38]They sound like elephants.
[21:00.69]Add feeding station and a water station.
[21:02.69]Pick up, put in cage.
[21:03.97]No, stop.
[21:04.25]Okay, habitat.
[21:04.69]We have water bowl.
[21:05.19]Food through small.
[21:26.88]For water bowl.
[21:28.18]Okay, so $100.
[21:28.84]That's a lot of money for just a big fucking box.
[21:34.13]Objects can be placed pretty much anywhere.
[21:36.40]Use the commands below to help change the position.
[21:37.98]Okay, so you rotate, raise, and lower.
[21:39.80]That's weird.
[21:43.87]And then put it in the ground, okay.
[21:46.31]Rotate is Z. I'm gonna have to remember that.
[21:50.59]Rotate... Toggle Advanced Mode... Is X. Oh, God.
[22:00.01]You get, like, these kind of, like, blender controls?
[22:04.91]Oh, no, I don't care about that.
[22:06.07]Oops.
[22:07.81]How do I move it?
[22:10.84]No, why do I have two?
[22:13.44]What have I done?
[22:15.08]Uh, they can't reach this.
[22:17.47]Okay, raise... How do I edit it?
[22:24.01]Why did I go into, like, the second life editing mode?
[22:28.03]How do I edit it?
[22:33.07]Oh, M. Hold on.
[22:37.59]Angle snap?
[22:38.61]Reset height is shit.
[22:40.15]Okay, shit.
[22:40.95]Reset height.
[22:43.42]There we go, okay.
[22:44.52]Align to surface is V. That's good.
[22:46.38]Alright, I'm gonna put it, like, over here.
[22:47.50]Let's put, like, their feeding tray over on the rock so people can watch them eat.
[22:52.27]And they can, like, look up and, like, sneeze the food onto people.
[22:55.03]I like that.
[22:55.53]Okay, how about here?
[22:56.17]Right here.
[22:58.83]Right there.
[22:59.23]Okay.
[23:05.21]And then now we need a... ...water dish.
[23:12.58]Aligned to surface, and, um... Yeah, uh... Alright, close enough.
[23:18.80]No.
[23:20.12]This is, like, kind of huge.
[23:21.22]Alright.
[23:22.38]How about... Over here.
[23:28.64]So they can, like... Yeah, I want them to, like, lift up and be able to be, like... Can I angle it?
[23:47.85]That's extremely unhygienic.
[23:51.42]You sign a waiver before you go to the zoo.
[23:53.56]Mud bath.
[23:53.80]Okay, get it as close to the people as possible.
[24:14.06]Okay.
[24:15.60]Um, how about like right here?
[24:17.18]Right in the corner.
[24:20.14]Right there.
[24:20.68]Splash zone.
[24:21.40]Yeah.
[24:21.52]Ostriches?
[24:22.52]Is this full?
[24:23.22]Do I have to fill this or is it full?
[24:25.24]How do I put food in here?
[24:45.74]Alright, let's go to the ostriches.
[24:52.57]This, I'm gonna make, my zoo is gonna be so bad.
[24:54.63]Okay.
[25:05.99]That's more like it.
[25:07.21]So can you do anything when it's paused?
[25:08.61]Sometimes it's a good idea to pause the game whilst you're doing something which requires your concentration because it'll stop the Zeus spinning out of control while you're looking the other way.
[25:18.10]Let's keep the game paused while we get this ostrich habitat built.
[25:21.88]Okay, job number one here is to add a habitat gate before we complete the barrier.
[25:27.79]Every habitat needs a habitat gate.
[25:30.45]Are there dinosaurs in this game?
[25:31.71]Are there T-Rexes here?
[25:32.37]Habitat gate.
[25:32.73]Like right there, right?
[25:45.89]Oh, it has to be in the gate right here.
[25:47.61]This is a tutorial, I'm curious.
[25:48.63]Okay.
[25:48.75]So that is as simple as just snapping it and dragging it or clicking... Oh, okay.
[25:51.79]Oh, nice.
[25:52.19]Well, this is kind of intuitive.
[26:21.45]Good work!
[26:23.48]Remember, before you can place animals in any habitat, it has to have a full loop of connected barrier.
[26:30.54]Now, you've probably noticed that guests can't actually see into this habitat at the moment.
[26:36.08]At least not without a stepladder.
[26:38.14]But seeing as they're banned, I'd like you to select a piece of barrier and swap out the brick for a glass barrier, so the guests can see in.
[26:47.30]The whole thing or just like one section?
[26:50.58]Just make everybody crowd around it.
[26:53.62]Yeah, like right here.
[26:54.30]Highlight a section of the barrier and then click the glass barrier in the browser.
[27:01.03]Okay.
[27:01.81]There we go.
[27:02.97]Adding in more windows gives guests even more opportunities to see the animals in a habitat.
[27:07.91]No, I want crowded areas here.
[27:08.89]It's always best to make sure the guests can get a good view into a habitat from the path they're walking on.
[27:14.12]Because it makes them happy.
[27:15.90]And because this would be a pretty...
[27:17.28]Why not do the whole thing glass then?
[27:19.00]These are the main source of income?
[27:19.94]It's through people... Wow, okay.
[27:48.14]this is a lot like streaming I'm just behind the glass here now before we adopt our ostriches you should click the play button after all if the games pause then so are our caretakers which will make it a bit tricky for them to deliver the ostriches eh okay so complete the ostrich I don't even have any ostriches
[28:08.62]by the way as well as pausing the game you can speed the game up by clicking on the fast forward button it'll run everything at two times and five times faster it can be useful especially if you're waiting for money to accumulate or for animals to be delivered to your habitat personally I use it when I'm waiting for a brew to finish alright you've finished the habitat so it's high time we adopted those ostriches don't you think let's get four of them in here ostriches are really tall right
[28:39.71]Now, let's see.
[28:40.23]Animal, uh, marketplace.
[28:42.27]Common ostrich.
[28:43.17]Do they have rarities?
[28:45.71]Like, is it like legendary ostrich?
[28:49.44]Epic ostrich?
[28:53.80]Do they actually have that?
[28:54.86]Alright.
[28:56.18]This one, why?
[28:56.74]This one's $464.
[29:01.34]How does it, what's this mean?
[29:03.66]Okay.
[29:03.84]Well, I'm just going to take, I'm going to get a Nao.
[29:06.51]Okay.
[29:09.63]Not waiting in the trade.
[29:10.55]Center.
[29:12.39]Move to here.
[29:17.79]Relocating to habitat 22.
[29:18.86]Alright, let's go.
[29:22.46]Hurry up.
[29:26.24]Where are you?
[29:26.60]Let's go.
[29:27.10]Get in.
[29:30.48]Why does somebody have to bring a box over here?
[29:32.30]Okay, here we go.
[29:42.64]This is opening loot boxes.
[29:45.46]Is that what they did in this game?
[29:46.86]Do I just buy crates and just open them?
[29:54.58]And it's like, what's... Nutrition.
[30:00.11]Alright, now I get a feeding zone.
[30:02.61]What about the... Do they want sprinklers?
[30:07.13]Is an ostrich, like, a three-year-old kid?
[30:11.39]No, I don't think we want these.
[30:15.47]Okay, so let's go to habitat.
[30:18.83]Food and water.
[30:20.71]Feeding state.
[30:21.99]Do I need two of these?
[30:22.73]How many of these do I need?
[30:29.67]Do I need more than one?
[30:34.90]Well, I'm going to get the expensive one.
[30:41.13]Five?
[30:41.59]Did you say five?
[30:43.28]I have to get all four of these?
[30:50.89]While we wait for them to be collected by the caretakers and brought to the habitat, you should get it ready for them.
[30:56.74]Add a suitable feeding station, water station, and an appropriate food enrichment item.
[31:03.36]It's often best to place things like enrichments and feeding stations near to the habitat perimeter, so guests can get a really good view of the animals.
[31:14.31]Wait, the mouse is fucked up.
[31:16.53]Hold on a second here.
[31:17.67]Why is this happening?
[31:23.44]Because right now I'm over the ostrich.
[31:30.58]I'm selecting the ostrich right now.
[31:33.79]What the hell is going on here?
[31:35.63]Wasn't this happening before?
[31:40.69]Hold on a second.
[31:41.35]Yeah, this shit was happening before too.
[31:50.13]This makes no sense.
[31:51.64]Alt-Tab?
[31:57.52]No.
[32:00.84]Okay, this... What?
[32:08.60]Why is this happening?
[32:13.99]Hide cursor in game?
[32:16.69]Try changing window to full screen.
[32:18.67]Let me see what happens if I just do full screen.
[32:20.17]This is weird.
[32:23.73]Maybe it is already in full screen.
[32:24.69]No, it's borderless?
[32:25.41]Alright, what if I just do full screen?
[32:35.76]There we go.
[32:36.38]Okay.
[32:38.26]That... weird.
[32:39.50]Alright, let's keep going.
[32:47.42]So, does this guy have to go back and get another one and then come back and bring it?
[32:51.06]Is this the only person that's here doing this?
[32:54.58]Alright, anyway, I need habitat.
[32:57.04]Alright, uh, water throw.
[33:01.42]They like to drink out of trees, don't they?
[33:03.45]No, that's a brontosaurus.
[33:05.49]Um...
[33:07.83]How about in the corner?
[33:09.25]No, no, no.
[33:09.77]Over here.
[33:10.09]I want it over here so they can, like, put water in the mouth and, like, go up and, like, spit it out over it, people.
[33:24.06]Okay.
[33:26.10]Food bowl.
[33:29.16]Alright, that's good.
[33:31.73]And then a slow feeder.
[33:40.29]Good to see the ostriches have somewhere they can really stretch their legs.
[33:45.31]Did you know they can actually run at 43 miles per hour?
[33:51.15]Oh, heaven forbid they ever escape.
[33:53.57]The speed camera finds a loan with bankruptcies.
[33:56.67]Alright, I did it.
[34:03.32]Visiting player.
[34:04.46]Bernie certainly seems impressed.
[34:06.84]Did you do a speed camera joke?
[34:09.64]Every time we get an ostrich.
[34:12.64]So now we've made the ostriches lives a bit better.
[34:15.92]Let's do the same for the keepers, shall we?
[34:18.01]Somebody's visiting the zoo?
[34:18.83]To make it easier for the keepers to feed the ostriches and hippos, we should build a new keeper hut.
[34:24.61]Keeper huts are where the keepers prepare the food for animals.
[34:28.11]So they should be placed near to the habitat to make sure the keepers don't waste their time walking when they should be looking after the animals.
[34:55.45]I can't.
[35:01.33]Who is this?
[35:03.00]Visiting player, who is this person?
[35:07.06]Visiting player.
[35:09.63]It's freaking me out.
[35:10.31]I didn't even listen to the... Alright.
[35:12.33]Keeper huts are found in the facilities menu.
[35:13.99]Alright.
[35:16.45]Place a keeper hut.
[35:20.43]Let's do this one.
[35:21.83]How it helps.
[35:23.89]Alright.
[35:24.48]Where did it want me to put this?
[35:34.72]I was too busy being Dark Souls invaded.
[35:36.38]Alright.
[35:36.94]Over here.
[35:42.01]That's really ugly.
[35:42.91]How about here?
[35:43.89]Right there.
[35:49.06]This keeper hut only has space for one keeper.
[35:52.38]But the larger keeper hut can allow multiple keepers to prepare food at the same time.
[35:56.80]Is this their apartment?
[35:57.86]Is this where they live?
[35:59.32]Keeper huts and other staff facilities shouldn't be placed near to areas where there are lots of guests.
[36:05.79]Guests don't like seeing facility buildings and it can affect their happiness.
[36:11.14]Why?
[36:11.46]Why?
[36:11.80]No, I don't want to see.
[36:13.98]I want to pretend like I'm in the Savannah.
[36:16.88]Well, like downtown San Francisco?
[36:18.40]Oh yeah, sorry.
[36:19.08]It's not like this fucking Savannah.
[36:20.72]You don't know that?
[36:40.53]Now, I don't like seeing that building that powers the place.
[36:43.97]Bury it.
[36:46.33]Disney World's like that.
[36:47.17]There's like fucking a whole city underground.
[36:52.78]Now, the reason everything has gone blue is because you're using the power heat map.
[36:57.06]This map allows you to see what is and what isn't powered in your zoo.
[37:01.52]So, once you've placed your transformer, you can click in the bottom left to turn the heat map off.
[37:09.30]Okay, so this is what's powering.
[37:11.83]So anything that's in this circle is being powered.
[37:15.83]They're not going to do like a Factorio type thing, are they?
[37:18.47]Lovely work.
[37:19.77]Now the keepers can start using the hut to prepare food.
[37:22.87]And thanks to where you've put it, they won't need to walk very far to deliver it to the ostriches and hippos.
[37:28.45]Let's get on to your next objective then.
[37:31.10]Bengal tigers.
[37:33.38]We want to adopt some, but I'm afraid there's nothing ready for them yet.
[37:36.78]Head on over to the plot of land I've marked out.
[37:39.24]It's not too far away.
[37:42.76]In the next building, it's the research zone and the transformation zone.
[37:47.68]Here, you can put two strength potions in with an ostrich, and you'll get a strength-based ostrich.
[37:54.11]I can't wait for that shit.
[38:03.07]What is this thing?
[38:04.45]What is this thing?
[38:07.97]What was the objective?
[38:09.57]I wasn't paying attention.
[38:10.63]I forget.
[38:13.09]Highlighted area.
[38:13.93]Okay.
[38:17.10]Righty.
[38:17.68]Your next job is to build a habitat.
[38:20.16]From scratch.
[38:22.30]And concrete and glass, I expect.
[38:24.02]So, go ahead and build it.
[38:25.24]Just make sure that the habitat includes that big hole we've dug.
[38:29.16]Oh, and don't forget to add a habitat gate to the barrier.
[38:33.57]Okay, so build a... build a Bengal tiger habitat.
[38:37.05]Sure.
[38:37.23]Not climbable.
[38:38.04]Watertight.
[39:13.63]There's a climbable rock.
[39:21.47]Like, it's the tutorial.
[39:22.83]I don't care.
[39:23.21]I'm just trying to learn how to do everything.
[39:24.73]Alright.
[39:28.50]Now we fill this hole with what was it again?
[39:33.06]Add the gate.
[39:34.16]Complete the habitat boundary.
[39:35.52]Okay, we need a gate.
[39:38.30]How about like over here?
[39:39.90]No, like in the back.
[39:41.02]This way.
[39:44.95]Now, Bernie takes safety very seriously at his zooms, so we should probably make sure those tigers can't jump out of the habitat, don't you think?
[39:54.18]The way we'll do it is by changing the height of the habitat's barrier.
[39:58.85]Okay then, you should start by double-clicking the habitat barrier, which will take you into barrier editing mode.
[40:06.68]Okay.
[40:07.99]Okay, length.
[40:09.69]Height.
[40:10.27]Drag this widget to select the habitat.
[40:12.71]Drag this.
[40:12.95]Okay, you just...
[40:33.75]now you've got all of the perimeter selected you can increase the height of it by clicking and dragging the barrier height tool upwards you'll want to make sure it reaches a height of at least 3.7 meters 3.7 meters can I change this to like I'm an American is this it click and drag it
[40:58.15]Turn this into like a baseball stadium.
[41:00.31]Alright.
[41:01.57]How about right here?
[41:03.73]Let's do four.
[41:07.99]Whatever.
[41:08.45]I have to make like Fenway Park.
[41:09.99]Yeah.
[41:10.41]I'll do that eventually.
[41:11.32]Okay.
[41:11.50]Donation box.
[41:27.26]Always remind me that the donation box is in facilities.
[41:30.40]As I will forget.
[41:31.05]Should I put more than one?
[41:31.89]Should I put like two or three of them?
[41:35.67]Well, people are going to be watching from here.
[41:37.19]Any more.
[41:38.87]Okay.
[41:39.31]Animal market.
[41:57.44]This is a very large increase.
[42:01.12]We went from like $200 to $10,000 to $12,000.
[42:02.15]Here.
[42:02.35]Alright.
[42:02.63]Alright.
[42:03.21]Okay.
[42:28.58]This is a food, a large food tray.
[42:41.04]I think I would like to eat here.
[42:41.93]Are these food trays or solo panels?
[42:43.29]Make a pool.
[42:43.85]Water options are found on terrain.
[42:45.03]Oh, no.
[42:45.71]Okay, water.
[43:09.13]Here it is.
[43:10.79]Calm water or rough water?
[43:12.57]Calm water, right?
[43:14.37]Add water is just left click, remove water... Oh, that was kind of scary.
[43:20.12]Water is an essential part of many animals' lives, so it's important in fact to consider when building a zoo.
[43:24.16]Many animals need a body of water in their habitat to swim, keep cool, and drink from.
[43:29.85]If water is necessary in this way, it'll be highlighted along with any space requirements in the terrain tab of the animal's info panel.
[43:36.05]Okay.
[43:37.73]Create a space to put the water, e.g.
[43:40.11]create a pit or lake with the terrain tools.
[43:42.71]Highlight the position of the wall in the space where the water must be filled.
[43:45.27]Click to fill.
[43:46.73]Some barrier wall types are capable of holding back water.
[43:49.19]That's it?
[43:50.49]That's enough.
[43:51.49]That looks like the bottom of a urinal.
[43:54.31]That does not look like a pool.
[43:56.05]I can save money, okay.
[44:07.78]Okay, let's put... Check it out.
[44:10.42]How is it?
[44:10.86]This is gonna make mud.
[44:19.35]They're drinking it.
[44:23.19]They're just eating mud.
[44:32.84]They're both gonna have diarrhea in like three hours.
[44:41.48]Alright, so what do I want to do?
[44:42.46]Place a toy and food enrichment item.
[44:49.44]Enrichment?
[44:50.88]Frozen blood pumpkin?
[44:56.00]Why is there blood in this pumpkin?
[45:02.89]And a rubbing pad.
[45:05.38]Here, come here.
[45:06.02]You can, like, use the rubbing pad.
[45:09.68]Now, the tigers will need a shelter in their habitat so they can hide from the guests.
[45:14.61]Do they drink blood out of a pumpkin?
[45:17.73]Is this for real?
[45:21.69]Go on, add a shelter to their habitat.
[45:23.27]Why are tigers fucked up?
[45:24.02]Just pop down the blueprint that I've already built for you.
[45:44.48]Oh god, they're hitting his brain!
[45:46.57]They're hitting his brain!
[45:49.19]Just take that clip like... I'm sorry.
[46:00.08]Okay, uh, half of that... So which way is correct?
[46:07.67]Should I put some solar panels on this?
[46:12.85]This way?
[46:13.37]Did I like to be facing people or not facing people?
[46:18.79]Oh, poor dabs.
[46:20.33]I'm sure it can't have escaped your attention that the tigers look a bit miffed.
[46:24.61]That's because they are too keen on the type of terrain in their habitat.
[46:29.17]Select a tiger and bring up its information panel.
[46:32.08]Okay, it doesn't like its habitat.
[46:33.54]We'll fill it with water.
[46:35.98]Rightio, click on the terrain tab.
[46:38.30]That way you can view the terrain information and see how they feel about the different types of terrain.
[46:43.20]That'll tell you what the tigers need more of or less of in this habitat.
[46:47.88]Okay.
[46:49.17]You need more terrain.
[46:51.79]Plants.
[46:55.59]Okay.
[46:57.67]I gave you more water.
[46:58.43]Alright, you want more plants.
[47:00.93]Alright.
[47:02.73]Oh, soil.
[47:03.47]Okay.
[47:03.85]Terrain painting tool.
[47:15.97]He was like sprinting.
[47:17.15]Alright.
[47:18.11]You want more short grass?
[47:21.70]Okay, I can do that for you.
[47:25.04]Oh, you want to cut the grass.
[47:26.64]Oh, I see.
[47:27.22]Tigers don't like grass to be long.
[47:37.00]What happens if I go too far outside the lines?
[47:38.50]Oh, I'm just in this habitat.
[47:40.78]That's awesome.
[47:43.78]You can't color outside the lines.
[47:49.65]That looks good.
[47:50.39]Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[47:51.93]Too much?
[47:54.82]Less grass.
[48:04.78]Okay.
[48:07.02]Whatever you... Okay, Goldilocks.
[48:15.57]There's too much... Now there's too much long grass.
[48:18.35]Animal needs less long grass.
[48:27.23]How much soil?
[48:28.49]Soil.
[48:36.53]Okay, we need less long grass.
[48:39.05]almost perfect right then all animals need plants and trees from their own biome or continent you know deserts savannas or Asia Europe that sort of thing it looks like these tigers need a few more plants in their habits to get a perfect fit use plants from the rainforest and temperate biomes that are native to Asia
[48:59.67]Farming -2.
[49:00.25]Farming -2.
[49:00.91]Farming -2.
[49:01.37]Okay, so let's take a look.
[49:02.11]So that's... Wattle bushes.
[49:02.67]Why would they put them here?
[49:28.19]Okay, the wattle bushes.
[49:29.77]So get rid of these.
[49:30.35]How do I delete them?
[49:30.95]Use filters to get the correct continent and biome for tigers.
[49:33.47]Um...
[49:56.47]Well, first, hold on a second.
[49:57.79]You got too many things open on my screen at once.
[49:59.97]Now, can I make this thing, like, 10% smaller?
[50:03.43]Hold on.
[50:06.39]Get out of here.
[50:07.03]Like, come here.
[50:12.78]Plants.
[50:13.16]Yeah, I know.
[50:15.14]So, if I go to your... Not enrichment...
[50:19.54]Terrain, terrain, okay.
[50:22.38]So, uh, environment.
[50:24.86]Plants and coverage.
[50:27.22]Continent, Asia, biomes, tropical, temperate, and grassland.
[50:31.47]But you don't like these, so how do I just... I want to just delete these.
[50:33.71]Like, how do I just get rid of these?
[50:41.23]Alright, so we need... We're going to do tropical.
[50:44.81]So, tropical and then...
[50:49.61]Asia.
[50:50.45]Sure.
[50:54.30]No, it's down here.
[50:57.60]So let's do, uh, tropical.
[51:01.68]And Asia.
[51:04.22]Alright.
[51:05.32]So you want some of these.
[51:06.04]How about, uh, coconut?
[51:07.90]Coconut palm.
[51:10.08]That would be cool.
[51:10.78]Over here.
[51:11.34]Right here.
[51:13.52]Let's put it over here so, like, the coconuts drop onto his head.
[51:20.10]That's gross.
[51:26.14]Can I straighten this thing up?
[51:31.00]Why is it so bent?
[51:35.04]Okay.
[51:37.04]Looks alright.
[51:37.84]I want to get rid of this.
[51:38.62]How do I just delete these?
[51:41.02]Delete.
[51:46.55]This has got to be an easier way for me to do this, right?
[51:51.38]Alright, how about a... Hmm... A bangle bamboo.
[51:56.82]Right there.
[51:57.98]Alright.
[51:58.33]Oh, I thought I put that down.
[52:03.89]Alright, you look like you're alright.
[52:08.02]How's your environment doing?
[52:08.90]You want more plants.
[52:10.00]Alright, get rid of this thing.
[52:12.82]Where is this?
[52:16.43]Kind of like go-to plant.
[52:17.64]Alright.
[52:18.56]Where's this thing right?
[52:19.40]This tree.
[52:19.84]They don't want this tree.
[52:21.38]They hate this thing.
[52:22.40]Okay.
[52:24.94]Now let me put... They want more plants.
[52:30.16]Why do you want so many?
[52:35.64]Do they really want that many more?
[52:36.76]Alright.
[52:37.30]How about a little group of these over here?
[52:44.67]Okay?
[52:46.47]And then... Alright, how's that?
[52:59.43]How do I clean up their shit?
[53:03.85]What's pre-recorded?
[53:04.93]Actually pre-recorded?
[53:07.11]What are you talking about?
[53:10.45]What is actually pre-recorded?
[53:16.94]I want it smaller.
[53:17.74]Here we go.
[53:23.20]Alright, is that fine?
[53:24.12]Do you like that?
[53:24.60]What do you mean no one said that?
[53:27.20]All of you were saying that.
[53:28.18]I need more of this?
[53:34.07]Coverage.
[53:36.31]Zero percent?
[53:37.27]How much more do you want?
[53:42.09]Alright, let's go with temperate.
[53:46.26]Asia.
[53:46.46]Asia.
[53:54.63]And... You want, like, some elm trees?
[53:59.59]This is so huge, though.
[54:01.45]This just blocks view.
[54:07.12]Put on your facecam.
[54:09.06]Not put on my facecam.
[54:19.94]Okay.
[54:21.26]And then how about, like, down here?
[54:32.20]It's more tree than animal.
[54:34.06]Alright, cool.
[54:35.44]I unlocked everything.
[54:37.04]I'm gonna move this.
[55:00.50]Right.
[55:01.18]Let's head over to the Indian peafowls.
[55:03.69]I've been told that we need to improve their social welfare.
[55:06.87]Okay.
[55:07.49]I'm starting to get it.
[55:08.11]There's a maze in here?
[55:11.57]This is cool.
[55:12.61]Just find one of the peafowls and select them to open their information panel.
[55:16.43]Then we can have a good gander at how they're doing.
[55:18.17]Is this maze for me?
[55:19.17]Although technically I suppose gandering would just be for geese.
[55:24.17]Oh.
[55:25.05]Found one.
[55:25.67]Expand their social welfare and we can get a bit more detail.
[55:29.77]Social group there are too few adults and juveniles in animal social group Now they've clearly got plenty of space and they're not stressed, but it looks like this social group isn't quite right So let's find out more Click on the social tab at the top of their information panel to see what's wrong Adult population there's only two
[55:51.86]Three female fowl.
[55:52.60]Okay.
[55:52.84]Here we go.
[55:53.33]We need female.
[55:53.93]Bring them in.
[56:19.64]I think I'm gonna play this, like, all night.
[56:21.64]I'm playing this- I'm, like, into this.
[56:24.93]Something wrong with the snow leopard?
[56:25.89]I didn't know I had a snow leopard.
[56:45.15]Just like people, animals can suffer from stress if things aren't quite right.
[56:50.30]You know, like when you see someone cut in the milk before the tea bag.
[56:54.06]In the case of these snow leopards, they're a bit stressed by their lack of privacy.
[56:59.25]You can lower their stress levels by swapping out the normal glass barrier by their cave for one-way glass.
[57:05.25]I don't see any stress.
[57:05.91]It's not a cheap option.
[57:07.58]But I think they're worth the expense, don't you?
[57:09.60]Where's the stress?
[57:10.60]Oh, what the fuck?
[57:10.98]It's going up.
[57:11.38]It's gonna jump over.
[57:21.85]I just realized how fucked up this is.
[57:26.65]Imagine if I looked out my window and there was like 700 people all looking in the window.
[57:49.68]By the way, this is when I'm showering.
[57:52.80]Wow, this is getting a lot of money.
[57:58.72]Imagine you get out of the shower, and you're just brushing your teeth with a towel around your waist.
[58:03.87]And you turn around, and the whole wall of your bedroom and your bathroom is glass.
[58:10.49]And there are just people staring there, watching you take a shower.
[58:18.04]I'm getting out of there, is what's gonna happen.
[58:24.96]Alright, so what do I need to do?
[58:28.00]Alright.
[58:28.92]Uh, one-way glass barrier.
[58:38.09]How much?
[58:38.61]Just enough to make them... I don't understand, like...
[58:46.02]The whole thing?
[58:46.68]Or just a little bit?
[58:48.11]Just where everybody's standing?
[58:53.29]Okay, so that's selected.
[58:54.29]Now... How do I say yes?
[58:56.53]Oh, I have to click... Why don't I just do... Oh!
[58:59.71]Right, okay.
[59:00.75]Well, this is even worse!
[59:19.93]How do I?
[59:20.27]What's going on here?
[59:21.79]Uh, what?
[59:23.83]I did it, right?
[59:25.13]That's not me doing it?
[59:27.35]Is there no wall?
[59:29.36]There's a wall here already.
[59:51.10]I don't understand what's going on.
[59:58.13]One-way glass.
[60:00.23]Like, select it.
[60:04.09]It's there, so why is it still telling me to do this?
[60:15.59]I'm selecting the wall.
[60:19.22]one wait one way glass from the outside that's what only the window part
[60:32.23]Of course, when an animal isn't in its natural biome, it's probably going to be too hot or too cold.
[60:37.93]Unsurprisingly for the snow leopards, it's too hot.
[60:41.49]I can't just select it?
[60:42.54]Look at me.
[60:43.70]You should help cool it down by adding some coolers to their habitat.
[60:47.36]But let's start by opening up the temperature heat map and having a look-see at the temperature in the leopard's habitat.
[60:53.56]Heat map.
[60:56.04]Open the heat map.
[60:58.69]This is electricity.
[60:59.81]Oh, okay.
[61:00.67]As you can see, we already have one cooler in there.
[61:03.39]Let's pop some more down and get as much of the habitat as chilly as we can.
[61:07.01]There's like too much going on.
[61:08.15]This habitat already has power.
[61:10.42]But you'll need to make sure of that in the future.
[61:11.98]So this is fake snow?
[61:13.30]Just so you know, if any part of a habitat is powered, then the whole habitat will be powered.
[61:18.04]This whole place is on fire.
[61:20.04]Look at how hot it is in here.
[61:21.42]Is that safe?
[61:26.59]Okay, coolers.
[61:30.98]so where should I put this just it doesn't matter anywhere over here oh how many do I want to put down okay is that better and it's still there working yeah
[61:58.44]Habitat 91% yeah, this is this is fine Put them in the middle These people are freezing So the whole habitats supposed to be like this well, I would have done that You can find heat maps for all sorts of helpful things so do be sure to explore them and make good use of them and
[62:27.05]Is this coolers and heaters?
[62:29.07]It'll take a little while for the temperature to adjust once you've added coolers or heaters.
[62:33.75]But now we've got the coolers in, we can address the leopard's terrain welfare.
[62:37.87]You see, what the leopards really want in here is snow and rock.
[62:40.77]So let's make that happen.
[62:43.43]So somebody just half-assed this part.
[62:46.31]Okay, terrain.
[62:47.70]So you want snow.
[62:50.84]Just the whole thing?
[62:52.54]We're just painting this on the ground.
[63:04.28]This is horrible.
[63:05.10]This is so cruel.
[63:11.27]Protestors have arrived at your zoo.
[63:18.17]What?
[63:18.45]There's only one.
[63:37.32]I say it.
[63:37.82]Okay, let's... That looks better.
[63:43.28]All of that should give you a pretty good understanding of how to make animals happy.
[63:47.59]So I'd like you to go and check on all the other animals in the zoo and fix up any issues with their habitat.
[63:52.39]Prove the care given to your animals.
[63:53.67]That'll increase the average welfare of the animals across the whole zoo.
[63:57.45]Why didn't you tell me about this?
[63:58.37]And that average welfare is a very important statistic.
[64:02.85]Now, to quickly see how all your animals are doing in the zoo, you should go into zoo management, and then into the animals section.
[64:09.91]Zoo management.
[64:12.79]And then go to the animals section.
[64:15.15]As you can see, this list shows you the animals' overall welfare.
[64:19.23]So, if something's amiss, then you can quickly pop over to them using the locate button.
[64:24.22]Right!
[64:24.96]I'm off for a cut-by while you make sure all the animals are well looked after.
[64:28.22]Habitat, enrichment, habitat.
[64:29.88]Oh wait, it's the zebras.
[64:37.67]You have contraceptives.
[64:38.99]What?
[64:41.94]How do I go over there?
[64:43.60]Alright, what's wrong with this place?
[64:47.16]Wait, there's not supposed to be giraffes in here!
[64:52.50]Where did you come from?
[64:54.38]Okay, what's wrong with this habitat?
[64:55.40]Let's find out.
[64:55.88]What do you think?
[64:56.76]What's wrong?
[64:57.20]Welfare.
[64:58.50]Your habitat sucks, and your enrichment sucks too.
[65:02.29]Insufficient food enrichment is being provided to cover all animals and there's not enough toys in here.
[65:07.61]Okay, and This is not good.
[65:10.95]Well, I didn't do this Yeah, just just get on like the the playground thing that spins around Everyone will have fun on that all eight of you can sit on it Alright, let's do um Terrain, so what's the what's wrong with the terrain?
[65:30.25]What kind of terrain do you like
[65:32.93]You like.
[65:34.57]Okay, there's not enough short grass.
[65:36.55]There's not enough long grass.
[65:37.61]And there's too much soil.
[65:40.19]Well, shit.
[65:40.99]I'll take care of this.
[65:43.66]Run in the terrain.
[65:45.64]Alright, there's not enough short grass.
[65:47.16]Let's do this around the bank.
[66:03.37]Plenty of rocks.
[66:06.57]Intensity... That's better.
[66:14.70]They have nice green grass over here.
[66:16.68]Okay, grass is good.
[66:22.18]Now we need some long grass.
[66:24.19]I'm going to do long grass over here.
[66:27.59]This way, back behind here.
[66:30.11]Are they even enclosed?
[66:38.61]They don't want any soil, so it's all short and long grass.
[66:47.70]Alright, take out the soil.
[66:52.70]This looks better.
[66:53.24]Alright, so that's better.
[66:59.60]Took care of that.
[67:04.30]Wait, it's too much.
[67:04.82]There's not enough short grass now.
[67:06.11]Got it.
[67:08.55]Okay.
[67:09.51]So that's okay now.
[67:10.43]You guys are happy.
[67:11.05]What about the giraffe?
[67:11.74]The giraffe is the only one in here.
[67:12.70]Is the giraffe the weird outlier here?
[67:16.02]Oh, shit.
[67:16.54]Okay, no.
[67:16.92]Special food.
[67:21.06]Enrichment.
[67:25.24]For a second I thought they were enriched by zebras.
[67:28.36]And I'm thinking, what kind of fucked up environment is this?
[67:32.59]No, that's a species bonus.
[67:33.95]Okay.
[67:36.01]Alright, so they don't like these trees.
[67:40.67]So why did you put them all here?
[67:42.31]They're everywhere.
[67:42.99]How many are in here?
[67:43.57]There's so many of these in here.
[67:47.07]Why are these all in here?
[67:56.31]It's for the tutorial.
[67:57.95]Yeah, but I mean, still, come on.
[67:59.21]What the hell are you thinking?
[68:03.58]Uh, where is it?
[68:04.10]Environment.
[68:06.10]It's every tree.
[68:07.40]Just delete every tree.
[68:14.37]Tell you, I ain't gonna make this mistake first.
[68:15.93]Alright, you better?
[68:20.89]Is there any more here?
[68:23.37]No, there's still... It's hard to even see these.
[68:34.36]Select button in the bottom right.
[68:40.98]Multi-tool select.
[68:43.63]Click and drag to create a selection.
[68:45.59]Click and drag to add to selection.
[68:47.09]Hold control to toggle selection.
[68:50.99]But I don't want to get rid of everything at this point.
[68:52.89]I guess I can just do this.
[68:54.05]No, no, no.
[68:54.65]There we go.
[68:57.53]That's good to know.
[68:58.25]Is it all these trees?
[69:01.44]Okay.
[69:03.06]Are we good now?
[69:03.92]You need more stuff, right?
[69:10.00]No.
[69:10.32]What else is left?
[69:15.03]Get these out of here!
[69:16.45]This is not even in your enclosure, because you can see it, you don't like it?
[69:24.94]Oh my fucking god, okay.
[69:35.31]They just hate trees.
[69:36.79]They- but... I didn't know that.
[69:46.10]Oh my fucking god.
[69:47.33]Okay.
[69:47.71]We're just starting from scratch.
[69:48.77]Fuck it.
[69:49.07]I don't even care.
[69:49.53]I'm just deleting everything.
[70:00.07]No, not this shit outside.
[70:01.37]Just this shit here.
[70:02.07]No, no, no, no, no.
[70:12.86]Why is this stuff sliding down?
[70:13.90]What are you doing?
[70:19.65]Why are you selecting the... What are you doing?
[70:24.10]Hey!
[70:31.12]Okay.
[70:34.30]We good?
[70:37.68]Is there any more just random one tree that I need to delete?
[70:43.10]There's probably like one or two more things here.
[70:45.64]Okay, you better.
[70:46.54]No.
[70:47.40]This is a hidden object game.
[70:49.40]Find the fucking dumb trees that we put here.
[70:54.85]What else?
[70:57.61]Oh my fucking god.
[70:59.09]Can I just delete all of them?
[71:00.83]Just delete them all.
[71:01.75]Why is this all in here?
[71:03.31]Just delete all.
[71:08.99]What?
[71:09.33]Delete the zoo.
[71:10.29]Delete zoo.
[71:10.91]Looking for trees.
[71:11.83]What?
[71:16.64]Holy shit, somebody just gave a lot of money.
[71:21.16]Doctor, doctor, give me the news.
[71:22.90]Thanks for the $50.
[71:25.97]Thank you, doctor.
[71:30.87]How do I delete this?
[71:37.73]Not pre-recorded.
[71:38.59]Why would the stream be pre-recorded?
[71:40.37]I can't just like mass delete this?
[71:44.57]There has to be a way, right?
[71:47.57]Like select and then like select.
[71:49.39]Oh my god.
[71:50.23]I have to give it to all of these.
[71:52.37]All of them?
[71:56.29]Just leave it.
[71:56.87]I can't.
[71:57.23]They hate it.
[71:57.81]I want to just... I just fucking deleted this.
[72:08.31]Why did it select that?
[72:14.71]Alright, I need to put that... Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[72:20.10]Doctor, doctor, thank you for the $50.
[72:21.78]5,000 bitches came in.
[72:23.50]Let me pause this.
[72:27.40]They say... I'd like to shake your hand if you ever get to another convention on the West Coast.
[72:36.81]I would love to do that, too.
[72:39.81]Thank you so much for the 5,000 bits.
[72:42.51]Really appreciate it.
[72:43.17]It's a lot of fucking money.
[72:44.29]Thank you.
[72:48.76]I hope he washes his hands.
[72:50.00]I do.
[72:52.14]And then there was another 5,000 before that by the same person.
[72:55.50]It was actually $100.
[72:55.90]It was 10,000.
[72:56.40]Dr. Doctor gave 10,000 bits.
[73:05.52]They say, they actually say, first time donator, but I've been a big fan of yours for years, so this is a long time coming.
[73:17.95]I know you always say never feel bad for not donating more money, but I wish I could.
[73:22.14]Unfortunately, my job security isn't great right now, so this is the best I can do, but I still wanted to give back at least a little to both the man and the stream that have helped me like countless others through some of my darkest times.
[73:33.67]You'll never know the true depth of your effect on so many people, Jeremy.
[73:39.45]Thanks a lot.
[73:44.23]That means a shitload.
[73:47.45]I'm glad that you can have fun here.
[73:49.25]Seriously.
[73:50.75]And I know I say it all the time.
[73:51.95]Don't feel bad for not donating money.
[73:55.13]That's not necessary.
[73:58.89]Take care of yourself.
[73:59.65]Take care of yourself first.
[74:01.92]You are number one.
[74:04.30]Put me somewhere else down that list.
[74:06.08]Take care of yourself.
[74:06.98]I wish you the best.
[74:14.16]So, moving on.
[74:15.36]I have deleted a few too many things.
[74:18.94]Somebody was saying it doesn't matter.
[74:20.35]Does it really not matter at all?
[74:25.11]Wait, is this... He's... He's escaped.
[74:29.03]What?
[74:33.95]Wait, did I fail the tutorial?
[74:37.67]He's going... Are they biting people?
[74:45.75]Why would you run towards the animal?
[74:47.97]Alright, I get it.
[74:48.61]I understand the gist of the game.
[74:49.65]Is there a rewind?
[74:50.55]Is there a rewind button?
[75:00.13]Is this how giraffes sleep?
[75:03.16]That's fucking crazy!
[75:06.78]What?
[75:08.92]Don't you get a stiff neck?
[75:14.30]Okay, alright, I get it, I get it.
[75:15.58]I understand how this works.
[75:22.32]Uh, come here.
[75:23.94]Come here, get over here.
[75:25.06]How do I pick you up?
[75:25.80]Call the vet?
[75:26.48]How do I pick you up?
[75:28.25]Emergency capture.
[75:32.34]But how do you... This is disabled by the tutorial.
[75:46.48]So how do I get them back?
[75:52.39]Where are they?
[75:56.93]Look, I didn't mean to delete this.
[75:58.35]I'm trying to delete plants because it's like... They don't like the shrubs in there.
[76:02.09]Get rid of them.
[76:02.61]They hate it.
[76:04.17]Was it The Sims?
[76:05.85]When you have a painting in the room that the Sim doesn't like, the fun goes to zero?
[76:15.31]There's an undo at the bottom.
[76:18.19]Wait, can I...
[76:26.11]How do I get the animals back in?
[76:37.26]No, no, no.
[76:37.76]Where are you going?
[76:38.32]Where are you going?
[76:38.92]How do I get these animals back in here?
[76:42.10]He's just walking around.
[76:55.62]Alright, how do I delete this part?
[76:57.12]Here, come here.
[77:07.19]Just let him walk around?
[77:08.87]Let them roam.
[77:09.57]No, I need to do the second tutorial.
[77:13.75]Okay, let's do this.
[77:14.71]Come here.
[77:15.95]This is temporary.
[77:16.86]I didn't want to fuck this whole thing up, but I have to.
[77:27.33]Get rid of this shit.
[77:28.15]How do I delete this road?
[77:31.43]Call the keeper?
[77:32.61]I can't... Can I not even... I don't think I can do that.
[77:36.98]Call vet.
[77:38.14]Because, look, I can't... I can't, like, emergency capture.
[77:42.50]Is vet gonna go over here?
[77:43.52]What about this?
[77:43.98]Call the vet.
[77:50.59]They'll walk back in when I'm hungry.
[77:55.44]He's going to the bathroom.
[77:56.90]They're all trying to leave.
[78:02.87]There's a line.
[78:04.17]There's a line out the door to leave.
[78:07.71]He can't even escape.
[78:10.19]What the hell was that?
[78:16.48]What, you got a sniper rifle?
[78:29.07]Just keep keep yeah, I didn't want it to go to like to shit You can just step over this you can step over.
[78:40.65]This is your baby game.
[78:42.21]Are you serious?
[78:43.76]Oh?
[79:00.91]Just because I deleted this, that was bullshit.
[79:02.83]Okay, the vet's on duty.
[79:06.60]What habitat's invalid?
[79:07.68]What's wrong with this?
[79:11.62]What?
[79:18.76]What's wrong?
[79:23.17]Did I buy something?
[79:26.29]Hold on a minute.
[79:26.87]What the fuck is going on here?
[79:40.44]How about a brick wall?
[79:45.16]Alright.
[79:49.48]Are we still good?
[79:50.31]This is an inva- How did it become invalid?
[80:02.27]How did I fuck this up?
[80:03.31]I don't understand what's wrong with this.
[80:21.14]How many are in here?
[80:27.21]What is wrong with this gate?
[80:31.17]Marked as not a habitat boundary.
[80:38.88]Where?
[80:39.52]How did I screw it up?
[80:45.02]Is it this part here that's the problem?
[80:50.12]I soft-locked it.
[80:52.52]The fence was fucked up, though.
[80:54.34]How did I fuck up the tutorial?
[80:56.00]Well, it's very easy, because I was selecting... I was selecting the bushes over here.
[81:00.50]And it was selecting this fucking building.
[81:02.64]And I deleted the building when I was selecting the bushes here.
[81:06.34]I did it like ten times.
[81:08.10]You sure you don't want to pick up this building and delete it?
[81:12.64]Look, I'm moving on to the next tutorial.
[81:15.12]I know what I'm doing.
[81:20.02]I softlocked myself, somebody said.
[81:22.24]Why was I selecting the bushes?
[81:23.38]Because they don't look... They don't like bushes.
[81:27.56]They fucking hate them.
[81:30.69]And it was like, there's something wrong with their habitat.
[81:32.67]They don't like the bushes.
[81:35.23]No, get... Look, see?
[81:39.10]Well, you know, they really, really don't like those trees.
[81:42.78]They don't like the bushes either.
[81:44.92]They hate them.
[81:48.86]So I have to go through and get rid of these or they're gonna hate their environment.
[81:56.48]No, I know how to play.
[81:57.56]I'm done.
[81:57.84]We're gonna play.
[82:03.16]Like, all these plants need to be deleted.
[82:17.31]Wait, what?
[82:22.15]Is it 90... Well, they hate everything in here.
[82:25.35]Okay, well... Okay, enrichment.
[82:29.83]We need food in here.
[82:35.15]Habitat.
[82:35.73]Alright, how about food and water.
[82:39.33]Food cage.
[82:39.96]What am I trying to do here?
[82:41.04]Enrichment.
[82:41.54]But what do you want for... Species food enrichment and toy enrichment.
[82:48.32]Zero enrichment items.
[82:49.48]Okay.
[82:50.28]Bamboo feeder.
[82:52.27]Walk a frozen fruit.
[82:53.37]That sounds pretty cool.
[82:54.21]Who's it for?
[83:00.31]No.
[83:00.57]Wait.
[83:00.93]Can I do it by giraffe?
[83:01.89]Alright, let's do it by giraffe.
[83:14.62]What kind of giraffe is this?
[83:21.60]Reticulated giraffe.
[83:27.65]Okay.
[83:29.39]Big suspended high feeder.
[83:33.13]There you go.
[83:33.91]Okay.
[83:34.41]And a sprinkler toy.
[83:36.79]That hurts my eyes.
[83:37.55]Alright, so that's good.
[83:44.04]Alright, so you're fine.
[83:46.22]One habitat-cleaning... Wait, there's a disease?
[83:51.23]Habitat-cleaning is a disease risk.
[83:53.29]For what?
[83:53.83]I don't even know where I'm going.
[83:58.43]The lemur?
[84:00.51]We haven't gotten that far in the tutorial yet.
[84:03.27]I can't believe I deleted that fucking building because I'm trying to select a goddamn bush.
[84:12.32]So what's wrong with this place?
[84:16.51]This is power.
[84:19.21]Is it like cleanliness?
[84:22.23]Habitat.
[84:26.13]Temperature, water, power, buildings, negative impact on guests.
[84:33.23]Why is it doing this?
[84:35.44]Habitat cleanliness is a disease risk.
[84:36.96]Let's put on your fucking x-ray goggles.
[84:44.07]How did somebody- Okay, I think I get it.
[85:07.82]I think I have to get out of this.
[85:10.20]I have to play a new scenario.
[85:11.58]It's all- It's fucked.
[85:12.84]Forever.
[85:20.96]oh alright I know I'm gonna do a different scenario that was horrible excuse me yeah okay let's go back to the main menu um should I save it I guess I'll save it just whatever uh
[85:56.98]Okay, main menu.
[85:59.34]We're gonna do a different... I still need to learn.
[86:01.36]I still need to learn how to play.
[86:09.39]I'm still learning.
[86:12.59]I opened up another scenario.
[86:14.17]See?
[86:15.69]Okay, I'm already done with the Goodwin house.
[86:20.66]The Madagascan Simian Conservation Project.
[86:25.51]Tutorial.
[86:27.49]Okay.
[86:29.13]This is just gonna teach us some new things.
[86:39.52]No tutorial?
[86:40.32]No, I have to do this.
[86:41.30]There's a lot of systems in place.
[86:42.72]I need to at least kind of have somewhat of an idea what the hell I'm doing.
[86:56.21]I can't I'm having trouble I can't get over it welcome to Madagascar it's quite the change of scenery from dreary old England huh apart from the weather I suppose they don't call these places rainforests for nothing the zoo you'll be working in is an ape sanctuary where we're doing vitally important conservation work
[87:21.34]Not just for apes, but for all kinds of species.
[87:24.58]But apes, well, apes are some of the closest relatives to humans there are.
[87:29.78]And yet, the way the world treats them is like, well, very much like some of us treat our actual relatives.
[87:39.26]Anyway, that's why I'm determined that our operation here does some good.
[87:43.94]If we can all leave some part of the world in a better state than we found it, we'll have lived lives worth living.
[87:51.05]And speaking of states, I have a horrible feeling I left the house in a right one.
[87:56.28]When I get back, I expect my life won't be worth living at all.
[87:59.38]Like, I'm stuck.
[88:00.52]I just keep thinking if you're out of the zoo, it is stuck in a tree above you and just falls down on everybody.
[88:07.54]It's warm for my tastes, to be honest.
[88:09.62]Anyway, this is Bernie's primate sanctuary.
[88:12.83]It's not just primates, though.
[88:14.13]We've got all sorts of animals.
[88:16.21]So why don't we go and have a look at some of them, eh?
[88:18.79]We'll start by taking a look at the red-ruffed lemurs.
[88:22.33]They're the ones that look like they should be in a Shakespeare play.
[88:25.75]Come on, let's head over to them.
[88:28.80]Okay.
[88:30.38]I think I'm gonna be alright.
[88:32.56]Okay, locate the highlighted area.
[88:34.08]There it is.
[88:36.22]This is a nice little setup.
[88:40.63]I thought these were sinks.
[88:41.95]From back here.
[88:42.39]Oh, cool.
[88:42.72]That's a long time.
[88:43.22]I like this little playground that they have.
[88:44.74]Alright, let's find the orangutans.
[89:07.09]Okay, let's go, let's take a look.
[89:34.71]I like the zoom-in feature.
[89:36.33]It's really cool.
[89:36.91]What's that noise?
[89:37.41]You can do cinematic camera?
[89:38.41]Okay, yeah.
[89:39.71]Alright, let's go to the other place.
[90:06.85]These habitats are really well done.
[90:08.09]I want to make like a habitat from scratch.
[90:09.55]That's pretty much what I care about.
[90:12.36]Oh, dear.
[90:13.88]It looks like we've arrived just in time.
[90:15.74]One of the habitat's barriers has collapsed.
[90:19.46]No.
[90:19.68]I got flashbacks.
[90:21.80]We'll need to catch them.
[90:23.16]But before we do, we should box up the other bonobos to stop them escaping too.
[90:28.16]Select the habitat boundary to bring up the habitat information panel.
[90:32.14]Okay.
[90:34.20]Good.
[90:34.66]Now open the animals tab.
[90:38.78]Animals.
[90:40.08]Box all animals.
[90:41.30]Whoa.
[90:41.62]Hire a vet.
[90:42.04]Okay.
[90:42.26]The staff.
[90:42.56]And then...
[91:04.84]You can find all of your staff in here, but there's no time to go looking at their particulars at the moment.
[91:10.30]Hire a vet.
[91:12.64]Hire a vet?
[91:13.72]Now, click on one of the paths to place the vet in your zoo.
[91:16.90]Right there.
[91:19.41]Great.
[91:19.97]Now let's deal with our escapee before they can cause too much havoc.
[91:23.95]Use the animal alerts to jump to the escaped bonobo.
[91:30.24]Okay, right here.
[91:31.04]Call the vet.
[91:31.50]Okay.
[91:31.66]I understand.
[91:32.28]I get it that this is, like, dangerous and scary, but, like, it's just one monkey.
[92:01.72]Did he trip?
[92:05.09]This guy don't give a fuck.
[92:10.23]Okay.
[92:15.75]So now I have... Relocating.
[92:21.30]As you can see, the barrier's collapsed.
[92:23.76]Someone's taken their eye off the ball, obviously.
[92:25.98]Let's get this one replaced.
[92:28.14]Select the barrier and then we'll edit it.
[92:30.92]Delete the broken section of barrier and replace it with a brand spanking new one.
[92:35.57]The broken section of barrier?
[92:40.09]Okay, so right here.
[92:43.93]So you have to delete the part first.
[92:47.91]How do they break it?
[92:55.20]I'm being obstructed.
[92:56.60]I'm not going to leave a barn door open.
[93:02.56]Connect it!
[93:02.93]Am I insane?
[93:21.18]I'm not, right?
[93:23.12]Good.
[93:23.83]Now that we've done that, we need to make sure to add climb-proof barriers to the top.
[93:28.41]That way the bonobos won't be able to climb out.
[93:30.87]Just make sure you've got the correct piece of barrier selected when you do that.
[93:34.59]So, climb-proof options.
[93:37.71]Climb-proof.
[93:38.19]Okay, so go into the options section and select which side the climb-proof barrier needs to go on.
[93:43.83]And don't get it wrong.
[93:45.85]We're more worried about bonobos climbing out than guests climbing in.
[93:50.77]People will climb into these things?
[93:52.35]That's not correct.
[93:53.17]Okay.
[94:15.94]What is it?
[94:16.22]Select a habitat information panel?
[94:18.40]And then open the animals tab.
[94:20.64]Animals.
[94:22.14]Unbox all animals.
[94:23.46]And finally, click on unbox all animals to let them out.
[94:28.04]I expect some of them are fair bursting for the toilet.
[94:34.73]So, it turns out that as well as the old vet leaving, the zoo's mechanics did too.
[94:39.73]We'll need to hire a couple of new ones so we can help stop any more breakouts.
[94:44.43]You see, mechanics do all sorts of helpful things around the zoo, but one of their most important jobs is taking care of the habitat barriers.
[94:53.37]Without mechanics around to repair them, the barriers will crack, crumble, and fall down.
[94:59.29]And before you know it, we'll be overrun with escaped animals.
[95:02.71]So don't do wood.
[95:03.43]Go into the zoo section and then into the staff management area again.
[95:06.84]Make it out of cement and then paint it to look like a tree.
[95:11.48]Right?
[95:11.70]I don't understand.
[95:15.53]Hire a mechanic and then click on a path to place them in the zoo.
[95:19.05]Okay.
[95:23.57]And then click on the path again to hire a second mechanic.
[95:27.50]As you can see, you don't have to go back into staff management if you're hiring lots of the same type of staff member.
[95:33.38]Okay.
[95:35.60]So now they're going to be able to walk.
[95:37.34]Oh, I'm choking.
[95:37.92]Alright, cool.
[95:38.49]What does he want?
[95:48.52]Oh.
[95:49.32]I hear you had a bit of an issue with an escape bonobo.
[95:52.75]The main thing is that you dealt with it swiftly.
[95:55.73]And more importantly, without the animal stealing someone's clothes, putting them on, and then walking out of the front gate.
[96:01.56]I thought that was an animal.
[96:04.64]You see, another key responsibility for our vets is animal research.
[96:09.08]Researching animals allows vets to unlock new enrichment items, additional information for our education resources, enhanced breeding programs, and improvements to food quality.
[96:20.86]Modbath.
[96:21.40]Modbath.
[96:21.94]Modbath.
[96:22.22]Modbath.
[96:22.48]Do it.
[96:22.64]Do it.
[96:22.80]A research center.
[96:23.26]Right here?
[96:51.82]now you've probably noticed that there's already a building where I want you to build the research center don't worry you see the building that's currently there is actually a hollow shell so we're able to place our new building inside of it if you select the research center for placement and then hover over the shell you'll see that it asks if you want to add the research center to the existing building
[97:17.08]okay so okay click to add it to the building oh but that won't place it in just yet though first we'll need to rotate our research center so it automatically connects to the path when we place it uh okay wait okay
[97:42.46]Ensure auto-stacking is off to make... Right.
[97:45.10]Splendid work.
[97:46.62]Now that we have a brand spanking new research center, we can give our vets something to do in there.
[97:53.11]Oh, by the way, it's worth noting that the vets will only do research when they're not required to do any other jobs.
[97:59.71]That said, you can change what jobs a vet does via the information panel.
[98:03.47]How much money did you get to start with?
[98:04.34]Let's not worry about that just now.
[98:06.98]So, let's get our vet researching ring-tailed lemurs.
[98:11.19]Go into the zoo section and select vet research.
[98:14.53]Vet research.
[98:16.35]And then, bugs.
[98:17.65]Alright, my first zoo is going to be bugs only.
[98:20.09]I just want to have a cockroach farm.
[98:21.62]One star, Megan.
[98:22.14]What is up with this?
[98:36.27]Actually, thinking about it, I'm not sure we've got any education boards or speakers by the Loomis Habitat.
[98:41.91]I'm gonna have like 10,000 cockroaches.
[98:44.28]Let's head over there and answer, so our guests can learn all about their fairy little delights.
[98:49.80]Okay.
[98:55.94]So this is... First off, let's pop down two education boards.
[98:59.30]Educational boards?
[99:00.16]Place them on the habitat barriers at a height that guests can see or, if you like, pop them down on a stand.
[99:07.87]Yeah, well, I would do that, but I think what I'm going to write here is... Private chests.
[99:15.77]Don't, do not open.
[99:16.76]I'm going to put two of them here, back to back, next to my storage box.
[99:23.42]What was I making?
[99:24.32]An educational board?
[99:38.92]What the hell is it?
[99:42.50]I thought they were throwing stuff into the habitat.
[99:44.16]Workshop, trade center, research center.
[99:46.64]What's it called?
[99:47.04]Information board?
[99:49.10]Education board?
[99:49.84]Facilities?
[99:50.38]Uh, is it not in there?
[99:51.08]What?
[100:11.12]Find education boards in here.
[100:12.71]Okay.
[100:13.63]What the fuck are you talking about?
[100:17.07]Oh, this?
[100:17.79]No.
[100:18.15]Oh my god, this is ugly.
[100:19.41]Align to surface.
[100:46.36]okay and then one over here okay now that they've been put into position we have to tell them what animal to display information about select one of the education boards to bring up its information panel
[101:02.65]Habitat education board, okay.
[101:05.33]Educational content.
[101:06.27]Just do cockroaches.
[101:07.23]Yeah!
[101:07.61]Okay, ring-tailed lemur.
[101:10.03]Cool.
[101:26.29]Okay.
[101:26.39]Okay.
[101:26.73]Why?
[101:53.67]What was that?
[101:54.51]This is like a flash mob.
[101:56.43]What are they doing?
[101:57.11]Okay.
[102:07.23]Speakers.
[102:08.35]Educational speaker.
[102:09.35]Right here.
[102:18.10]And then right here.
[102:23.94]Now we simply need to link the speakers to the ring-tailed lemurs.
[102:27.70]Just like you did with the education boards.
[102:29.82]Okay.
[102:32.15]I'm going to put like ten of these next to each other and have each one of them be a different animal.
[102:37.17]It's going to be un-fucking-bearable.
[102:45.87]Fantastic.
[102:47.54]It's worth remembering that education boards and speakers both need power to work.
[102:53.19]So I need a power supply.
[102:55.31]Okay, let's take it out.
[103:12.67]Okay, what do you got?
[103:13.95]Collect my research.
[103:15.45]So I have to take them off.
[103:26.83]Well, now that we've enriched the lives of our guests, let's enrich the lives of our ring-tailed lemurs.
[103:33.88]Some animals like lemurs will have a climbing need.
[103:37.50]That means they have a requirement for a certain amount of climbing space, and you can fulfill that requirement by building them a climbing frame.
[103:45.29]Let's find out how much more climbing space our lemur friends need, shall we?
[103:50.03]Select one of them and bring up their information panel.
[103:54.61]how many you need oh wow they hate this next click on the terrain tab they need land area they don't care about water quite a lot more climbing space but as it happens I've already got a climbing frame blueprint built for you so you can either pop that down or build one yourself from scratch
[104:15.11]By the way, it's not always just climbing needs that you have to worry about.
[104:18.72]This thing?
[104:19.28]Other animals might need a certain amount of water in their habitat so they can go for a swim.
[104:24.36]They certainly do keep us on our toes.
[104:27.50]Wow, look at this.
[104:31.21]But I can just make my own.
[104:55.21]No, wait, hold on.
[104:56.51]Move, get her to this.
[105:15.79]So we can have a huge view.
[105:21.22]No, I want, give me the small one.
[105:27.69]Too tall?
[105:30.55]Give him a space to go out.
[105:33.31]No, not yet.
[105:34.31]Not yet.
[105:34.79]That's for, like, in, like, 20 minutes.
[105:37.14]Alright, I wanna, like, hold on.
[105:49.24]It's not snap to surface.
[105:50.74]Here we go.
[105:57.38]I want to bring this up.
[105:58.14]Come on, get on there.
[105:59.52]What?
[105:59.80]Okay.
[106:29.35]And then this way.
[106:39.77]That'll stand, right?
[106:43.63]Is that enough?
[106:52.76]I know it's disgusting, but it doesn't matter.
[106:58.13]Environment.
[106:58.57]What do you want?
[106:59.21]Terrain?
[106:59.65]Okay.
[106:59.93]I need more than that?
[107:00.87]Alright, how about um... Habitat.
[107:05.63]Climbable.
[107:10.88]Shift it around like this.
[107:13.92]Do they jump?
[107:22.88]Okay.
[107:23.66]I'm going to wrap around this way.
[107:58.64]Then I can go up here.
[108:01.26]What's this guy doing?
[108:04.28]What is he doing with the leaf blower?
[108:05.49]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[108:06.01]Connect this.
[108:10.79]Alright, then it's going to go a little bit higher from here.
[108:12.51]And this here.
[108:15.17]How much more space do you need?
[108:16.33]There we go.
[108:16.95]Alright, now I'm going to connect this.
[108:35.84]That does not look stable at all.
[108:40.90]That's very... That's like dad's first treehouse for the kids.
[108:47.44]No, it's not.
[108:47.96]That's huge and horrible.
[108:49.20]I would never want a child on this.
[108:51.79]Alright, that looks good.
[108:52.77]So they got their climbable area now.
[108:55.24]What else do they need?
[109:00.22]Social enrichment.
[109:02.98]Species toy enrichment.
[109:04.20]Okay, so they need... Ooh, hold on.
[109:06.72]Look, he loves it.
[109:17.59]He loves it!
[109:20.10]Look, he's having so much fun!
[109:23.27]He just jumped from here to there.
[109:28.28]Look at how high up this is.
[109:32.42]Did he just shit?
[109:35.72]I think.
[109:37.76]You gotta go up to the very top.
[109:45.01]Oh, he's got itchy ears.
[109:49.15]Now take it away from him.
[109:50.35]Make him learn life is cruel.
[109:54.71]This would cost more money to dismantle than it did to put up.
[109:57.91]Don't miss!
[109:59.63]Don't miss!
[110:02.65]That was dangerous.
[110:05.16]Oh, look!
[110:05.52]Another one!
[110:11.78]All the way to the top.
[110:14.32]Yeah!
[110:15.32]Whoa!
[110:17.05]Whoa!
[110:21.59]That was insane!
[110:23.01]I can't believe you made that!
[110:32.76]Can you get down?
[110:33.30]Is this a baby?
[110:34.22]Does tail up mean like I'm scared?
[110:40.51]Uh-oh.
[111:00.17]No, no, it's good.
[111:02.11]Go for it again.
[111:02.57]Let's see the jump again.
[111:03.25]Come on.
[111:04.89]Impress us.
[111:06.45]Big jump.
[111:10.40]Nice.
[111:12.84]Nice.
[111:13.38]That was cool.
[111:14.90]You guys didn't like my structure and now you say it's like their favorite thing in the world.
[111:18.82]Alright, we need some toy shit.
[111:23.34]So we need some toys.
[111:27.03]Are these lemur toys?
[111:31.80]Who's been in a box?
[111:32.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[111:34.34]What do you mean they've been in a box for too long?
[111:36.46]Why are they in a box?
[111:43.11]Why are you putting them in boxes?
[111:51.43]Why are they in boxes?
[111:59.43]That's weird.
[111:59.97]Alright, I know a lemur toy.
[112:05.11]Oh, cardboard box!
[112:06.63]Watch this shit.
[112:08.65]Oh yeah, you better believe it.
[112:09.81]You're gonna get the skateboard too up here.
[112:16.04]Block of ice.
[112:21.08]Musical skateboard!
[112:22.23]Oh yeah.
[112:24.21]All their toys will be up here.
[112:26.01]Beach ball.
[112:35.44]They're gonna love this.
[112:37.58]Okay, now social.
[112:39.52]Severe social welfare issues.
[112:43.28]Insufficient size or crowding issues are present.
[112:46.64]Are you alright, though?
[112:47.26]Like, overall, you're okay.
[112:51.01]We need to expand it.
[112:53.25]Is it because this is too big?
[113:03.43]Um, maybe I should drop?
[113:05.12]Get rid of some of these?
[113:06.40]Let's get rid of this one.
[113:08.36]Hey!
[113:09.72]Why are you capturing my lemurs?
[113:15.54]What are you doing?
[113:16.14]Stop doing that!
[113:17.16]Who's doing that?
[113:26.19]I need more space.
[113:27.01]Can I just pull this out?
[113:27.89]Okay.
[113:34.14]They need more space.
[113:39.85]Social.
[113:41.95]Okay, animal has moderate social.
[113:43.61]Yeah, but I need to make this bigger.
[113:49.57]Too many lemurs.
[113:51.67]Is that why she's deleting them?
[113:52.89]Wait, we might get a skateboard.
[113:54.62]What the fuck was that?
[114:04.08]Superman jump.
[114:05.78]Ah.
[114:07.02]Okay.
[114:10.84]Can somebody play the keyboard?
[114:13.84]Look, there's a box up here.
[114:15.00]Who's gonna get in first?
[114:20.80]Hey!
[114:21.79]That was not very nice.
[114:22.89]Uh.
[114:41.75]I think they're fine.
[114:42.61]I love the long jump.
[114:47.41]I want to make an even bigger one.
[114:52.27]Yeah, they're fine.
[114:53.07]Wait!
[114:57.61]Yes!
[115:02.49]Look at how smart he is.
[115:16.12]Vet research is complete.
[115:17.30]Oh, I did it.
[115:20.26]You've discovered three items.
[115:23.08]Alright, so let's put you... What do I do here?
[115:30.63]What's the next part of the tutorial?
[115:31.71]Because, I mean, they're...
[115:39.88]Space.
[115:41.34]Too crowded?
[115:42.30]So, should I, like... Put cockroaches in here?
[115:46.95]I know.
[115:47.37]I'm gonna do the bug zoo.
[115:48.61]Alright.
[115:48.81]You know what?
[115:49.89]I think I know what I need to know.
[115:55.55]I can't do this.
[115:56.53]I think it's time for me to make my bug zoo.
[116:04.46]Free the hippo.
[116:07.93]Where's the hippo?
[116:13.80]Where's the hippo?
[116:15.26]Here?
[116:16.18]No, where's my animal chart?
[116:41.56]Okay, let's go with, uh... Here we go.
[116:45.92]Where are you?
[116:46.40]Over here?
[116:54.35]Can't delete this?
[116:56.17]Can I not delete this barrier?
[117:07.27]I can't delete it in the tutorial.
[117:08.87]It won't let me.
[117:11.28]It does not want me to delete this.
[117:25.99]Well, oh well.
[117:29.11]You have to run the tutorial in administrator mode.
[117:36.44]What if I make it easy to get out?
[117:40.89]No, the game definitely doesn't want me to do this right now.
[117:48.18]No.
[117:52.09]No, I can't.
[117:52.75]Alright.
[117:53.85]Well, I know what I'm doing now.
[117:55.47]It's time for me to make my zoo.
[117:56.97]Let me save it.
[118:00.71]It's time.
[118:03.86]I want to make my insect zoo.
[118:09.91]Why can't I delete the building in the last one?
[118:19.60]Okay, here we go.
[118:20.26]Franchise.
[118:20.84]Build zoos all around the world and trade your animals online.
[118:24.78]Let's do, uh, franchise?
[118:29.48]Or sandbox.
[118:30.74]Sandbox.
[118:33.34]Create new zoo.
[118:34.18]Scenario zoo.
[118:36.47]Alright, what's the best bug zone?
[118:40.97]Probably tropical, right?
[118:45.51]North America, let's go to... Name the zoo.
[118:52.78]Bugs.
[118:56.22]Is there more than just cockroaches, or am I just gonna have a big cockroach?
[118:59.80]Bug world?
[119:05.54]Bug World is so easy.
[119:10.99]Roach Ranch.
[119:17.83]Roach Ranch is pretty good.
[119:22.36]Let's go.
[119:22.82]North America, Roach Ranch.
[119:24.14]You guys are going to have to help me out here, though.
[119:35.33]Okay.
[119:36.91]Holy shit, this is the biggest bug zoo you've ever seen.
[119:39.57]So, I'm gonna pause it.
[119:42.11]Here's the entrance.
[119:42.91]Alright.
[119:43.67]Is there, like... Okay.
[119:47.33]Barriers.
[119:48.21]Blueprints.
[119:48.85]Construction.
[119:52.29]Uh, construction.
[119:55.57]Uh... Uh... Terrain.
[119:58.09]Oh, we did paths.
[119:59.09]Okay, here we go.
[119:59.45]Path.
[120:01.31]Path.
[120:03.15]Um, this is fine.
[120:04.39]We'll go out like this.
[120:09.93]Just to start it.
[120:17.31]Go up four, and then... Alright, Ray's path is U.
[120:22.38]Oh, alright.
[120:23.98]Lower path is J. What else is there?
[120:27.13]Increase length.
[120:27.95]That's what I want.
[120:28.83]It's a weird thing to have for increase length.
[120:31.43]Okay.
[120:31.85]I can actually put this down here too.
[120:33.93]Width.
[120:34.71]I want this a little wider.
[120:35.51]Okay.
[120:42.76]That's a good spot.
[120:43.46]Now let's go this way.
[120:50.36]One, two.
[120:51.24]Done.
[120:52.48]Out this side.
[120:55.88]One, two.
[120:57.76]That's good.
[120:58.28]And then we'll have a spot... I want, like, a little circle.
[121:03.34]I'll do one... No, we'll just shorten it here.
[121:05.04]That'd be, like, information and stuff over this wood.
[121:17.08]Okay.
[121:18.56]Maybe one this... No...
[121:21.73]Okay, that's fine.
[121:25.31]It's crooked.
[121:26.31]Shut up.
[121:30.67]It's crooked.
[121:32.01]Oh, no.
[121:33.37]Whatever will I do?
[121:34.27]Oh, I'm in unlimited?
[121:35.23]I have unlimited money and everything?
[121:36.56]Okay.
[121:44.12]So.
[121:45.86]Let's start.
[121:46.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[121:46.96]Now I'm gonna go up.
[121:49.56]I wanna raise the path.
[121:52.71]You, right?
[121:53.17]Okay, let's go this way.
[121:57.37]Keep it right there.
[121:58.15]Because this is going to wrap around.
[122:00.55]There's going to be a big bug encasement here.
[122:02.85]That'll wrap this way.
[122:17.93]Okay.
[122:25.13]Then over here, I want this to extend out a little bit more.
[122:29.60]And then we'll go up this way.
[122:31.08]Okay.
[122:40.44]Oops.
[122:42.01]No, that's fine.
[122:42.65]And then... I don't want to fuck this up.
[122:48.47]There could be something here.
[122:49.87]No, that's too short.
[122:51.57]That's not long enough.
[122:53.21]Undo it all.
[122:56.81]I'm gonna start with this.
[122:57.49]I'm gonna overwhelm myself.
[122:58.41]Okay, we're gonna start with this.
[123:01.17]So I got paths here.
[123:02.16]I need... Alright, habitat.
[123:06.12]Bugs.
[123:06.60]No.
[123:07.32]Um... Uh, insect?
[123:12.27]Species.
[123:14.07]Oh, shit.
[123:14.91]Um...
[123:33.69]Bison.
[123:34.87]Camel.
[123:39.71]What was this thing called?
[123:40.67]Something cockroach, right?
[123:46.08]Is it not here?
[123:46.62]Do I have to research it?
[123:53.30]I think I have to research this.
[124:01.83]Oh, animals.
[124:02.45]Let's go to... Staff.
[124:05.47]Oh, I need some vets.
[124:06.57]Alright, let's hire a couple vets.
[124:09.42]One, two, three.
[124:09.86]Okay, and then let's go... Caretaker.
[124:13.48]Let's do one, two, three.
[124:14.70]And then... Okay, Keeper.
[124:15.44]We need, like, one, two, three...
[124:30.02]I have unlimited money, so who cares?
[124:31.36]Hire a mechanic.
[124:32.10]One, two.
[124:35.80]Bug vets.
[124:38.21]One security guard.
[124:39.11]They just have to protect the bugs, so it doesn't really matter.
[124:44.13]Vendor.
[124:45.15]One, two.
[124:47.71]Okay.
[124:49.18]Habitat.
[124:51.60]Food and water.
[124:52.32]Heaters.
[124:54.92]Facilities.
[124:55.76]Constructions.
[124:56.56]Blueprints.
[124:58.28]Facilities?
[125:12.43]Small exhibit.
[125:25.87]Facilities.
[125:26.75]Small exhibits.
[125:27.81]Okay.
[125:34.23]Alright.
[125:34.77]Classic small exhibit.
[125:37.58]Okay, how about just a classic...
[125:41.35]Yeah, but this sucks though.
[125:42.47]I want them in a big cage.
[125:47.43]Is this gonna be like a series of dog houses?
[125:54.80]I can't do that?
[125:55.64]What, I can't put like 5,000 cockroaches in a cage?
[125:59.94]A roach cage.
[126:03.76]Alright, well, whatever.
[126:05.10]That's fine.
[126:13.31]Ow!
[126:14.98]God!
[126:22.62]Ow!
[126:31.19]Dude, they couldn't have had this be anything less harsh than this?
[126:33.87]Alright, that looks fine.
[126:41.31]Roach.
[126:41.83]A full roach sidewalk.
[126:43.29]That's what I'm doing.
[126:45.75]Okay.
[126:46.51]Small animal exhibits.
[126:48.65]Now I can do... So now how do I... Where do I get my animals?
[126:54.29]I can get them from the... You must have at least one trade center in your zoo in order to trade animals.
[126:59.51]Right.
[126:59.77]Okay.
[127:00.05]Well, let's do it.
[127:00.73]Trade center.
[127:05.30]Uh... Animal trade center.
[127:07.92]This has to be inside one of these, doesn't it?
[127:10.70]Alright, let's do the Trade Center, like, over here.
[127:12.62]No, this has to be inside one of these buildings.
[127:17.38]No, whatever.
[127:17.86]Who cares?
[127:19.87]Does it really matter that much?
[127:24.33]He's making a roach exchange.
[127:29.88]Alright, this is fine.
[127:40.59]Okay, animal trading.
[127:41.55]Here we go.
[127:43.21]So, bugs.
[127:45.79]We're looking for bugs.

[130:26.37]Do they need anything?
[130:27.27]Okay, welfare and... Wait, the exhibit sucks.
[130:34.16]What's wrong with it?
[130:36.34]Exhibit layout is partially providing enrichment features.
[130:39.06]Humidity.
[130:43.46]They need more humidity.
[130:49.05]How do I increase the humidity?
[130:52.65]Humidity.

[132:07.12]Alright, 30, and then 70% humidity.
[132:09.80]Can I do it to all of them?
[132:19.39]Oh, for the love of God.
[132:24.15]There's no power.
[132:28.27]Okay, I make a power plant.
[132:29.23]Hold on.
[132:33.53]Alright, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, before they die.
[132:35.65]You're microwaving them.
[132:38.98]I'm, they're fine.
[132:50.82]It's not a, it's not a pizza oven.
[132:56.23]I'm trying to get it to be ideal, and then I'm gonna put the power on.
[133:01.36]Just wait until my buggy museum is done.
[133:04.84]Hold all your judgments for like another 20 minutes.

[134:51.04]The layout is still something wrong with it.
[134:54.46]Layout.
[134:55.64]Broken hollow log.
[135:02.24]Okay, and... Oh, it just wants, like, some cool stuff.
[135:09.38]Alright, I got you.
[135:10.70]And, like, no, no, no.

[135:15.26]Alright, you like the layout now.
[135:18.72]This one will do a log and then some leaves.
[135:26.29]People allowed in here yet?
[135:28.25]Did I open the park?
[135:29.65]No, no, no, no, no.
[135:30.55]The park's not open yet.
[135:31.59]There's just like six bugs.
[135:33.93]You shouldn't be kept... Hold on.
[135:36.03]Pause it.
[135:36.43]Pause it.
[135:43.50]That looks good.
[135:44.10]That looks good.
[135:44.80]I just gotta do it on all these.
[135:48.56]They want to see the bugs.
[135:49.36]Yeah, but you have to wait.
[135:54.69]Okay, that one looks alright.
[136:00.15]Why don't we just put the shit in here?
[136:01.17]It doesn't cost any money.
[136:07.33]Implement a breeding program.
[136:09.49]Well, first I have to make sure that they can live in here.
[136:19.22]Where are the speakers?
[136:21.94]I'm getting there.
[136:23.12]Hold on a second.
[136:24.02]Alright, climate windows.

[137:03.43]Oh, fuck it.
[137:03.79]They don't need it.
[137:05.23]Wait.
[137:07.59]This doesn't make any sense.
[137:15.76]Just put different lessons on here.
[137:17.66]They can't get over here.
[137:19.02]Alright, let me just go.
[137:19.76]Where's my path?
[137:20.28]I'm just going to fill it in.
[137:25.72]One bloody roach gets a bigger room than I do and fucker didn't even pay rent.
[137:38.68]Alright, I will improve on this.
[137:39.98]I need to put some foliage and stuff around too.
[137:43.58]Okay, I want to see the cockroach though.
[137:45.56]Let's go ahead.
[137:49.26]Are you even in there?
[137:53.94]You know the funny thing about enclosures like this?
[137:58.69]You could just have nothing in here.
[138:00.91]How many times have you gone up to an enclosure like this?
[138:02.49]Whether it's like a lizard or a bug or something.
[138:04.09]Oh, where is he?
[138:05.29]Oh, he must be under a rock somewhere.
[138:08.23]There he is!
[138:08.49]What if we just don't put anything in here?
[138:17.06]There he is!
[138:17.52]There he is!
[138:17.92]I wanna go over there!

[138:29.70]Oh no, right there!
[138:37.56]What is that noise?
[138:55.87]The only people here are the workers.
[138:57.29]Why is nobody coming over here?
[139:05.16]What?
[139:09.64]They're turning around.
[139:10.86]No one's even seen the exhibit yet.
[139:23.01]Okay.
[139:24.45]Alright, alright, alright.
[139:27.05]No, no, no.
[139:27.43]I gotta keep him here.
[139:28.15]We're gonna need a selling point.
[139:36.85]What looks like a bug but isn't a bug?
[139:50.96]Giant pandas?
[139:57.20]No, not a rhino.
[140:04.99]No, no, no, no.
[140:05.77]I have to... Hold on.
[140:07.05]I'm going to put some... Maybe it's the type of bug they don't like.
[140:10.91]I also need some facilities.
[140:12.33]What else do we need?
[140:13.09]Bathrooms?
[140:15.03]Okay, we need a... Staff room?
[140:21.16]Keeper hut.
[140:21.86]Okay, we need a keeper hut, right?
[140:24.34]That's important.
[140:37.05]I don't want to put it over here, though.
[140:38.65]Let's put it, like, over this way.
[140:40.83]It has to be close.
[140:42.63]But not in the way.
[140:44.41]I'm going to block it with trees later.
[140:45.66]Okay, this is a keeper hut.
[140:51.42]Guests don't like to see facility buildings?
[140:53.50]That's alright.
[141:00.33]They're not going to have to.
[141:13.43]Okay, looks good.
[141:24.18]This is the final boss room.
[141:31.10]Okay, now Keeper Hut.

[142:21.58]That's all this is down here.
[142:25.94]Okay, quarantine.
[142:32.10]Why can you put it underneath?
[142:36.51]You need power in these buildings?
[142:37.67]Don't worry, I'll make power.

[145:48.31]This is all fucked up, though.
[145:49.29]Let me do paths and fix this.
[146:00.17]No, that looks like shit.
[146:02.22]That can stay.
[146:05.18]Now we're gonna make some foliage and stuff.
[146:09.68]Okay.

[146:43.95]Does it have to be small?
[146:50.57]No.
[146:51.85]No.
[146:52.29]No.
[146:52.65]Damn it.
[146:53.80]Because this could be a big thing for the spiders.
[147:00.36]Let me try it.
[147:00.84]Let me see if it works.
[147:08.05]This'll be the spider den.
[147:10.35]Alright, this is gonna be shrunken.

[150:10.89]I'm putting one insect.
[150:14.43]Oh, this place sucks.
[150:19.49]What a waste of space.
[150:22.58]Alright, goliath beetles.

[150:25.99]Okay, I feel you.
[150:30.63]Alright, so that's good.
[150:31.56]We don't need the goliath beetles.
[150:34.38]So now, let me go back here.
[150:35.62]That's why everyone hates this.
[150:38.24]Who's in this enclosure right now?

[165:26.49]I'm gonna sneeze really loud.
[165:29.88]Okay.
[165:32.24]Plants, let's do... What's kind of buggy?
[165:39.20]Bushes?
[165:42.22]That's nice.
[165:42.68]Alright, now over here we're going to do... I want some big trees.
[165:52.72]Not too big.
[165:57.19]Ooh!
[165:58.95]This is kind of cool.
[166:20.14]Nice, okay.
[166:30.24]Fuck.
[166:31.04]I didn't- I didn't mean to put like a squid in the tree.
[166:39.79]What do you mean wasteland?
[166:40.59]It's supposed to be bugs.
[166:45.37]That's- and this is like bugs.
[167:00.59]Haunted house?
[167:01.69]I'm not making a haunted house.
[167:14.79]I need like some... Here we go.
[167:26.96]That looks cool.
[167:39.52]How about this one?
[167:40.42]Moss.
[167:41.18]I like the moss.
[167:41.78]Looks nice.
[167:42.32]This is really earthy and interesting.
[167:50.90]This actually sucks.
[167:52.70]Well, that's... We can have different opinions.
[167:54.64]That's fine.
[167:55.04]I'll do that.
[168:06.03]I'm gonna get some cool lights in here and shit.
[168:09.75]Let's get some big trees back here.
[168:12.53]Carpet moss?
[168:16.79]No, that's weird.
[168:18.81]Oh, look at this!
[168:19.95]Alright, and now you're gonna tell me that this is not cool?
[168:33.74]It's not cool.
[168:44.35]It's too much?
[168:44.87]I think it might be too much.
[168:46.45]This is too much.
[169:03.30]What is this thing?
[169:04.12]Okay, wait, how about back here?
[169:07.52]No, this doesn't work.
[169:09.84]How about...
[169:12.24]Ooh, I like this.
[169:13.64]No, it needs to be bigger than that.
[169:15.44]No, bigger than that.
[169:16.86]Bigger than this.
[169:18.86]That's cool.
[169:19.82]No, doesn't fit with the theme.
[169:21.38]That's cool too, but does this fit with the theme?
[169:30.71]Not really, right?
[169:38.73]This fits with the theme.
[169:48.93]It's like wooded.
[170:10.71]What the hell am I going to do over here?
[170:13.85]No, this is too... It looks too...
[170:17.87]No, no, no.
[170:18.17]I don't think I even need it.
[170:19.05]No.
[170:19.25]Maybe just a couple more little brushes.
[170:22.25]Just some little brush.
[170:24.19]No, it doesn't fit with the theme.
[170:25.26]I need a... Okay, that's alright.
[170:28.08]No, that doesn't fit with the theme either.
[170:29.24]Let's go with... I don't know.
[170:49.49]Okay.
[170:54.55]This is three different worlds.
[170:58.25]Now, you know what it is?
[170:59.11]It's gotta be broken up back here.
[171:00.23]You know what I'm saying?
[171:03.38]Like, there's gonna be shit over here too.
[171:04.64]It's gotta be broken up with a few more, with like some trees and shit.
[171:08.96]That's the issue that I'm seeing.
[171:17.82]It needs one mega tree.
[171:23.49]Because then I'll put something in here and it'll attack.
[171:25.45]Yeah, I mean, that's the problem.
[171:27.33]That was the problem.
[171:31.82]Okay.
[171:36.72]Alright, I'll go back to this and finish this some other time.
[171:38.98]Whatever.
[171:43.27]What is that, moss?
[171:46.21]Ooh, ivy.
[171:46.79]Ooh!
[171:48.27]Oh, wait, hold on.
[171:49.37]Cool.
[171:54.52]Alright, I don't want to... Hold on.
[171:55.50]I wanted to make it so it doesn't... No, that doesn't work.
[172:14.99]Now that actually is a haunted house.
[172:18.66]I can't do it.
[172:32.22]Oh, stop it.
[172:42.92]No.
[172:43.54]Less is more.
[172:45.94]Get rid of this one in the middle.
[172:47.22]It's two, one, two, three.
[172:49.08]You know what I mean?
[172:52.74]Get rid of that.
[172:53.23]Get rid of this two.
[172:54.03]It's two, you know, it's like one, two, one, two, one, two.
[172:56.47]That's fine there.
[172:57.95]Okay, that's better.
[172:58.53]I like that.
[173:03.93]This looks like shit, but I can't really move it anywhere.
[173:06.53]Could I angle it?
[173:07.17]Let me see if I can angle this.
[173:14.94]Can I angle it down?
[173:16.00]I guess that defeats the entire purpose of a solar panel.
[173:26.09]That looks a little better.
[173:28.67]Alright, so now...
[173:31.14]Alright, now it's time to get a real animal in here.
[173:32.99]This is going back here.
[173:36.31]I'm bringing in something ridiculous.
[173:38.23]I want... Like... How about... Hmm.
[173:48.16]I want to have like the... The lemurs are the ones that jump around, right?
[173:51.84]Yeah.
[173:52.22]Okay.
[173:52.60]I want a lemur enclosure.
[173:56.10]Like all over here.
[173:56.86]And I want to have a huge obstacle course.
[174:01.51]Alligators?
[174:02.09]That's not bad either.
[174:02.83]Let's do alligator first.
[174:03.63]Alright, habitat.
[174:06.78]I need alligator.
[174:08.48]Can I do it by animal?
[174:13.28]Species.
[174:13.80]Okay, alligator.
[174:18.03]What are these called?
[174:18.61]Is it crocodile or alligator?
[174:24.69]Saltwater crocodile.
[174:25.89]There we go.
[174:28.41]So, I need...
[174:32.23]uh basic shelter with dimensions shelter where they eat the pumpkin brain alright uh I need the walls first barrier okay so can I what can a crocodile not go through just make a hedge maze concrete what can it glass that would be kind of cool
[175:02.20]Alright, this is going to go... This is going to be like a couple of shops here.
[175:05.68]And then it's going to lead into the alligator enclosure.
[175:10.42]So I'm going to say... Like right here.
[175:13.18]And we'll go... Because there'll be the entrance this way.
[175:15.14]So we'll go like this.
[175:19.34]Come across here.
[175:20.12]I wonder how big does it need to be?
[175:27.65]Crocodiles are my favorite bug.
[175:38.78]I think that's alright.
[175:39.48]I should be able to close it up here.
[175:40.72]Okay.
[175:49.19]Let's get an entrance.
[175:52.25]Out this way.
[175:55.47]Oh, shit.
[175:55.71]I'm going to pull this in so they can look down at the alligators.
[175:57.68]That's perfect.
[175:59.10]That's too small?
[176:00.66]Is it really?
[176:03.08]Is it?
[176:24.14]Is that alright?
[176:30.80]Bigger than this.
[176:33.80]No way.
[176:37.59]No, this is huge.
[176:39.71]Okay, so now I'm gonna get the gate on here.
[176:41.97]Habitat gate.
[176:44.51]There.
[176:46.55]Alright.
[176:47.43]Now I need... Alright, so this is alligator habitat.
[176:51.83]What are alligators like?
[177:01.27]What should I have in here?
[177:01.85]Like five?
[177:02.65]Ten of them?
[177:07.04]Okay, they need... Okay, source.
[177:11.76]Compare mates.
[177:12.56]Alright, this is fine.
[177:13.64]This is the same thing.
[177:14.74]Put 200 gators.
[177:23.79]Well, I'll put it... Just have a shitload.
[177:28.87]Okay.
[177:30.03]Let's just do this.
[177:30.93]Male and then female.
[177:36.37]You're in there.
[177:36.90]I'll do two of these.
[177:42.38]And then two females.
[177:49.54]That's not a gator.
[177:51.32]It's a crocodile, isn't it?
[177:58.57]Okay, then, here we go.
[177:59.47]We'll do, uh... Two, uh... Two... There we go.
[178:04.03]One more.
[178:11.51]Are we remaking that game where every... The city's run off by animals?
[178:15.55]Huh?
[178:16.95]Alright, now, I gotta get the environment correct.
[178:23.28]Because, what are alligators like?
[178:25.74]I guess I need them to be there first, and then pause it.
[178:28.65]Alright, well, it's there.
[178:30.39]I need water.
[178:31.05]That's very, very clear.
[178:41.78]The person's got a really long run.
[178:44.16]Where are they running to?
[178:47.48]Oh, shit!
[178:48.14]Somebody called in an order!
[178:50.96]I gotta run!
[178:52.00]Where are you going?
[179:00.33]Someone needs to feed the roaches?
[179:01.71]Did he run into the bathroom?
[179:06.69]Oh, I hope he runs to the bathroom.
[179:08.71]That's so far to go.
[179:19.05]Oh, I need another- okay, we need more staff rooms.
[179:22.22]Oh, here we go.
[179:24.72]Here are the alligators.
[179:25.54]Alright, what do you like?
[179:27.20]What's wrong?
[179:29.70]Zoo alert.
[179:30.48]Keeper hut too small.
[179:32.32]Wait, this doesn't have any power?
[179:35.23]Oh, fuck.
[179:35.93]Okay, hold on.
[179:36.49]Pause it.
[179:39.17]That's why he had to run all the way.
[179:51.20]That looks so ugly.
[179:54.25]That's better.
[179:54.69]Okay.
[179:58.41]Okay.
[179:59.05]Let's... What do we got here?
[180:02.09]Low welfare.
[180:02.98]Right.
[180:03.18]Okay.
[180:03.44]So let me get... So the need... What do you guys like?
[180:08.14]You want water.
[180:10.20]Okay.
[180:10.76]Let's get rid of this tree because it's useless right now.
[180:17.09]Okay.
[180:17.33]Here we go.
[180:17.85]Four coming in.
[180:19.95]So we need some... We need to dig up some water.
[180:23.13]Very important.
[180:23.65]Okay.
[180:25.09]They need critical size or crowding issues.
[180:29.47]Okay, well, first of all, let's do water.
[180:34.61]Terrain.
[180:37.05]Sculpting.
[180:39.35]So we need to go down.
[180:42.79]We told you.
[180:43.69]How big does this shit need to be?
[180:45.11]This is like the whole park.
[180:47.19]I can fix it.
[180:47.73]It's alright.
[180:48.05]Alright, so let me go to size.
[180:50.55]Drop the intensity, drop the size.
[180:53.88]This would be the little area over here.
[181:01.59]I can't really see what the fuck I'm doing.
[181:07.29]How deep does this need to be?
[181:08.37]This looks too deep.
[181:14.15]Actually, they do want deep water, don't they?
[181:27.05]We need more intensity.
[181:33.74]Okay, how's that?
[181:34.92]Maybe a little bit more?
[181:39.41]What does too deep mean for a crocodile?
[181:41.01]They can swim.
[181:44.89]Right.
[181:45.57]That's true.
[181:46.41]That's completely right.
[181:54.14]It's going to have to be, like, 80% of their enclosure, right?
[182:03.35]They want to, like, swim around.
[182:04.33]Okay.
[182:13.90]Then they can... Whoa, that's too much.
[182:16.30]Hold on.
[182:16.68]Bring that... I have to bring this back up.
[182:30.45]They need a place to come out and eat though.
[182:35.69]Flatten to surface.
[182:37.67]Oh, I like that.
[182:38.83]Take this.
[182:39.67]Check this out.
[182:40.21]Oh, I'm making man-made rocks.
[182:59.99]No, it's gotta go this way.
[183:02.73]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[183:03.49]What the fuck are you doing?
[183:06.47]The size is too big.
[183:07.23]That's the problem.
[183:07.77]Okay, here we go.
[183:15.91]It's like bumpy and rocky.
[183:17.31]It doesn't have to be perfect.
[183:28.80]This is huge.
[183:31.25]I think I'm good.
[183:31.85]This is huge.
[183:32.47]This is absolutely massive.
[183:35.93]Plus, they need a place to come out and, like, beach.
[183:47.88]Let's see what this looks like.
[183:48.62]Alright, let's put some water in here.
[183:49.54]Take a look at that.
[183:56.24]Perfect.
[183:56.70]A little higher.
[183:57.26]Look at that.
[184:00.22]That's pretty beautiful, if you ask me.
[184:01.34]Alright, now let's give him... What do you want?
[184:06.78]What do you want?
[184:09.33]More water?
[184:16.77]Coverage of what?
[184:23.38]Coverage.
[184:23.74]Plants.
[184:25.24]Plants.
[184:26.98]Alright, tropical... Aquatic plants.
[184:29.16]Aquatic plants.
[184:29.78]Let's do it.
[184:39.54]Cool.
[184:39.86]Ooh, okay, lily pads.
[184:42.35]Let's put some of these on here.
[184:47.89]Uh...
[184:56.96]These look like just dinner plates.
[184:58.90]Here we go.
[185:08.39]Pretty good, alright.
[185:10.43]Wait, you don't like lily pads.
[185:12.09]Why do you not like lily pads?
[185:13.57]What?
[185:17.85]Those look so cool, too.
[185:19.07]Come on, man.
[185:19.73]Alright, aquatic.
[185:23.19]Okay.
[185:27.86]What are you talking about, then?
[185:34.52]Asia Aquatic.
[185:38.88]Oh.
[185:41.12]Little trees?
[185:42.34]Alright, I'll put a little tree down here.
[185:46.30]Okay.
[185:46.72]Coverage, 1%.
[185:47.44]Reeds?
[185:49.34]Ooh.
[185:50.63]I can stick some of these over here.
[185:51.75]Like, one, two.
[185:53.11]Some more of these over here.
[185:55.99]Common reeds.
[185:59.23]Get this right.
[186:01.75]Let's get one right here and then spin it around like this.
[186:04.43]Like that.
[186:06.77]And then like one more like right here.
[186:08.57]Okay, cool.
[186:10.11]What about this?
[186:10.75]Common water lily.
[186:11.67]We're almost there.
[186:23.18]Tropical.
[186:26.02]Banana plant.
[186:34.31]Banana palm?
[186:34.95]Alright, we're almost done.
[186:41.68]Ooh!
[186:42.52]Wait, this is gonna be the big- the big cellar here.
[186:44.42]How about, like, right against the wall this way?
[186:48.82]No one's gonna be looking this way.
[186:49.72]Yeah, they will.
[186:50.52]Uh, how about, like, up here?
[186:55.54]I'm thinking, like, right there.
[186:56.86]Right, like, here.
[186:58.20]In the corner.
[187:00.46]Alright, we're at 100%.
[187:00.90]We're good.
[187:03.07]Alright, now I have to feed them.
[187:04.79]Wait, what about rocks?
[187:06.55]I want some rocks.
[187:17.36]Is that too much?
[187:45.19]Alright, okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[187:46.57]I just need to see if it was possible.
[187:52.52]Just a little one, like one of these.
[188:04.91]Just a Little Rock formation, you know what I mean?
[188:06.99]I don't want it to be huge.
[188:14.61]Just like that.
[188:15.21]That looks nice.
[188:21.55]Okay, that's fine.
[188:25.77]Well, how cold is it in here?
[188:30.46]Enrichment.
[188:30.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[188:36.80]Okay, cool.

[188:48.39]Let's go to habitat.
[188:53.47]Wait, wait, wait.
[188:54.19]People are starting to notice there's alligators.
[188:58.45]Okay, so... What happened over here?
[189:01.18]Okay.
[189:02.74]We need to do a blood scent marker enrichment.
[189:09.10]I don't know where to put this.
[189:10.52]Like over here?
[189:11.00]I don't know anything about alligators.
[189:14.83]Lay over here.
[189:15.27]Okay.
[189:18.53]How about a food tray?
[189:19.99]Large food tray.
[189:20.99]Are they going to eat next to their favorite rocks?
[189:26.56]Let's put another one over here.
[189:30.22]Frozen blood pumpkin.
[189:32.20]Put that over here next to the blood tray.
[189:35.58]Okay, cool.
[189:36.16]What about a water jet?
[189:40.39]Ooh, cool.
[189:41.63]No.
[189:42.67]Water pipe?
[189:45.78]What is this for?
[189:48.72]Do they step on this and pump their own water?
[189:54.45]No, they don't.
[190:01.15]How we doing?
[190:01.51]We need a little bit more?
[190:06.70]Mud bath.
[190:08.36]Can I fit this over here?
[190:09.16]Alright, I'm going to make it a little bigger.
[190:14.99]Let's edit this barrier.
[190:15.71]Let's take this part off.
[190:18.12]Okay.
[190:34.44]Delete that.
[190:35.04]Okay, so now I'm gonna put a mud bath up here.
[190:47.63]Okay, mud bath.
[190:50.19]Habitat bedding large.
[190:51.75]Oh, fuck.

[190:58.93]Basic, basic, basic.
[191:00.23]How big does this need to be?
[191:02.66]Oh, god damn it.
[191:03.46]It needs to be huge.
[191:07.24]Uh... Does that work?
[191:18.70]Alright.

[191:24.26]Is it alright?
[191:33.52]That looks fine.
[191:34.00]Alright, I think we're good.
[191:36.91]How the hell are they doing?
[191:39.05]Yeah, they're good.
[191:40.87]They seem to be comfortable.
[191:43.59]Look at their feeding tray.
[191:48.02]Oh, I need a sign.
[191:49.30]Stop, stop, stop.
[191:49.80]No, no, no.
[191:50.12]You're not doing this for free.
[191:53.00]Relax, everybody.
[191:53.74]You're not doing this shit for free.
[192:02.41]What am I looking for?
[192:03.01]I'm looking for... What's it called?
[192:06.73]Board?
[192:06.97]Did I put a keyboard in there?

[192:18.89]If you would give some money, that'd be nice too.
[192:21.51]There's nowhere to view these alligators from.
[192:25.39]Right.
[192:25.81]Okay.
[192:26.37]Let me fix that.
[192:43.56]That's gotta be wider than this.
[192:44.86]Fuck.

[192:52.79]Wider.
[192:53.05]Okay, that's good.
[192:57.18]We curve it this way.
[193:01.72]I want him to be able to get close.
[193:11.30]That's a good place to stop.
[193:12.54]Then you can turn this way if you want, and then bang, something else is over here.
[193:19.28]Alright, let me take a look at how this looks.
[193:24.52]Get these donation boxes out of here.
[193:25.92]Move them up here.

[199:54.39]There's a whole place to go and enjoy the alligators from a really cool angle.
[199:59.10]Is this one alive?
[200:01.86]Yeah.
[200:06.69]Oh, here we go.

[200:35.23]Oh, right.
[200:35.55]I want to do some more stuff here.
[200:36.35]Alright, um Why does the alligator enclosure suck so bad?
[200:45.83]People need to seriously come here and figure this out That was a long throw They'll figure it out eventually.
[200:57.05]That's a staff door.
[200:57.97]Get the fuck away from the staff door.
[201:00.89]The path is not connected?
[201:01.95]Yes, it is.
[201:02.35]People are walking up.
[201:05.19]How is this not connected?
[201:07.29]Okay.
[201:17.57]I feel like this doesn't need to exist.
[201:20.19]But it does.
[201:20.57]Alright, do they have water?
[201:21.45]This is water, technically, right?
[201:23.19]Yeah.
[201:24.95]Alright, the next thing I want to make, I'm going to do... We're going to go this way.
[201:28.07]And in here, there's going to be two viewing levels.
[201:32.44]Of fucking elephants.
[201:34.28]I have no idea.
[201:38.06]Uh, I don't need this right now.
[201:39.08]I'll just move it.
[201:42.42]Alright, barrier.
[201:43.98]What do I want to make here?
[201:51.23]No, I want to make the ones that can jump around.
[201:53.19]The lemurs.
[201:57.99]Maybe a bunch of flamingos?
[202:04.52]This used to be Roach Ranch.
[202:06.60]Well, not anymore.
[202:07.22]Because... Okay, here we go.
[202:11.99]Ring-tailed lemurs.
[202:12.89]What do they need?
[202:16.67]They need... Alright, uh... So, Africa, Madagascar, tropical biome, grade 1 climb proof.
[202:27.58]Alright.
[202:30.02]Uh, does it matter what it is?
[202:35.66]raid six semi-transparent not climbable this would be nice because they can now they can turn around look at this way too
[203:05.57]This would be cool.
[203:12.61]This would be where they sleep.
[203:19.66]And then I can... Alright, I gotta get rid of this.
[203:27.02]Wait, this is an electric fence.
[203:28.42]That'll be alright.
[203:30.06]Let us not turn it on.
[203:33.20]Alright, pause it for a second.
[203:43.72]How do I tie this?
[203:44.80]Okay, it's gonna go this way.
[203:50.86]It'll connect right here.
[203:51.86]Yeah, I'll deal with that later.
[203:54.06]It's gonna connect right there, and then it can go around, and there we go.
[203:56.80]Yeah, you got it.
[203:58.00]You understand.
[204:03.05]Let's keep going.
[204:03.77]Uh, what are you doing?
[204:08.67]This way.
[204:09.03]No, stop, stop.
[204:09.55]What are you doing?
[204:10.07]Alright, over here.
[204:14.86]So they can look down into the enclosure.
[204:16.79]And they'll be able to see it.
[204:17.71]They'll be able to jump up and look at them and stuff, right?
[204:22.93]That's big enough for the lemurs, I think.
[204:24.03]Yeah.
[204:33.08]Oh, it needs to be higher?
[204:42.59]Well, I mean, it's not a T-Rex, so it doesn't need to be that high.
[204:45.19]No, because then they can't see over this.
[204:48.27]No, no, I want it down here.
[204:52.33]It has to be below this so they can look in.
[204:59.16]This is a high-security lemur.
[205:02.46]Alright, so there we go.
[205:03.54]Now... Okay, lemurs.
[205:05.80]Lemurs.
[205:10.86]Climbable.
[205:11.68]Right, okay.
[205:13.88]Um... I have to build this out.
[205:16.92]Ooh, there's already cool stuff here.
[205:19.66]Holy shit, that's awesome.
[205:21.66]Oh, that's so cool.
[205:22.74]Look at how cool this is.
[205:24.48]Alright.
[205:24.74]It's gonna go like this, in the corner.
[205:43.94]Can they jump?
[205:44.66]Can they go from here to there?
[205:49.82]Are they smart enough for that?
[205:50.86]So how are you supposed to keep them in?
[206:03.95]I want a huge jump.
[206:06.63]No, fuck this.
[206:09.21]Delete this.
[206:15.70]Okay, ready?
[206:16.88]I want it to go from here across the hallway.
[206:19.73]They're going to do these huge jumps.
[206:26.83]Wait, I need the long one.
[206:35.91]This is not going to fall over, is it?
[206:39.07]No, give me the... Where's the longest one?
[206:40.65]Six meters?
[206:41.11]There we go.
[206:58.09]I have a better idea.
[207:16.61]I want this to go as high as I can get it.
[207:20.79]I'm gonna give them an insane diving board.
[207:29.76]That's not what I wanted to do.
[207:31.68]It's okay, whatever.
[207:32.54]I mean, that's really dangerous.
[207:42.27]Oh, how can I make this?
[208:13.96]This is big.
[208:14.52]This is like gonna be two or three hundred feet tall.
[208:19.18]Are they gonna be able to get up here?
[208:20.19]What happens if they climb the whole thing?
[208:25.51]No, I gotta change that angle.
[208:29.59]They just stay in the enclosure.
[208:32.96]Oh, check this shit out.
[208:34.04]You guys are gonna lose your minds when you see this one.
[209:04.39]Why can you go this high?
[209:09.42]Somebody said I'm building a satellite.
[209:13.32]Why can I do this still?
[209:14.86]I should be stopped.
[209:16.15]Shouldn't I be stopped by now?
[209:34.69]Honestly, why can I keep going?
[209:38.68]Is there a skybox?
[209:44.37]Holy shit.
[210:01.47]Not rapture, what was it called the other one the one that was high at all low No, you can't I
[210:35.06]Why is this allowed?
[210:43.50]Let's try turning it this way.
[210:46.84]Now check this shit out, ready?
[210:47.78]This is gonna be a huge jump.
[210:53.24]Do you think we can make it?
[210:57.08]Just do a second zoo up here.
[210:58.74]This is the lemur portion.
[211:02.28]Alright, I gotta make it so it's doable.
[211:05.31]So it's right here.
[211:06.03]And then... That's doable, right?
[211:21.44]And then they can get down.
[211:38.41]This is going to come back into the enclosure.
[211:41.61]Wait, where is their enclosure?
[211:42.95]Oh, over there.
[211:43.43]Okay.
[211:51.54]Oh my god.
[211:52.24]I have to look at this from a fucked up angle.
[211:57.30]It's got to go over here.
[212:04.56]And then back this way.
[212:09.43]Because they need to be able to jump down too.
[212:25.67]Okay, I'm getting there.
[212:30.01]Can I make this longer?
[212:31.85]No.
[212:35.50]Oh my god.
[212:36.48]Okay, hold on.
[212:38.23]I have to look at it from up, so that's the only way this is gonna be possible.
[212:45.45]Oh man, no it's not.
[212:52.86]What if they go the other way up?
[212:54.60]They won't be able to.
[212:57.54]I've already thought about that plan already.
[213:02.16]Alright, then down.
[213:04.30]I have to get on... There we go.
[213:05.36]Okay, good.
[213:06.86]Almost back in the enclosure.
[213:09.80]How long is this?
[213:11.14]This might be better, actually.
[213:27.97]Can I keep going up, though?
[213:31.34]Unpause for a second.
[213:32.38]What do you mean, unpause for a second?
[213:38.23]Oh, it stands alright.
[213:42.37]Okay, close.
[214:05.25]90 degree drop?
[214:07.16]Well, not quite.
[214:07.76]Hold on.
[214:09.12]I gotta go that way.
[214:10.80]I mean, if I'm a lemur, this is probably the coolest thing I've ever seen in my whole life.
[214:20.23]Oops.
[214:20.45]I mean, they want to be up high.
[214:23.71]Alright, that's good.
[214:38.25]There we go.
[214:42.26]Can they make the jump?
[214:44.34]This is all I care about right now.
[214:45.50]Alright, what about, like, from here?
[214:53.90]I can't fucking believe it can still go up.
[214:56.42]I cannot believe this.
[215:03.74]This, I can't believe- No, this is unbelievable.
[215:05.64]This shouldn't be able to happen.
[215:06.66]Is this broken?
[215:09.51]I don't think it's supposed to be like this.
[215:25.46]I'm making getting over it.
[215:26.72]Yeah, I am.
[215:34.83]Well, I mean, it is sandbox mode, but...
[215:40.93]Ridiculous.
[215:42.63]Oh, wait, wait.
[215:44.11]Can I put one of these all the way up here?
[216:05.16]Guys, I've never seen anything like this before.
[216:19.46]Even if the animal escapes, how's... How... Is Yvette gonna get up here?
[216:25.22]Do they have to climb this?
[216:37.16]We're still going.
[216:48.10]This is like the magic beanstalk.
[217:12.96]I'm getting to the point where I'm not sure I want to keep doing this.
[217:19.23]We have to watch somebody go up here.
[217:21.11]A lemur's not gonna go all the way up here.
[217:34.23]I think it's it.
[217:35.85]That's it!
[217:37.92]That's it!
[217:39.70]That's it!
[217:41.62]No, it's not!
[217:42.92]No, it's not!
[217:44.14]That's not it!
[217:46.22]It keeps going!
[217:58.99]What the fuck?
[218:03.41]Oh my god, please!
[218:06.26]How high can I... No, no, no, no, no, no, it's fucking up.
[218:25.83]It's just gonna take like 20 minutes to watch your lemur go all the way up here.
[218:38.51]Ooh, it's getting hairy.
[218:50.90]Hey!
[218:51.64]Hey, Edna!
[218:53.52]Does the TV work yet?
[218:56.02]Maybe just adjust it a little to the left.
[219:10.23]Done.
[219:10.49]Good luck.
[219:14.13]We're gonna get rid of this.
[219:46.30]I want one way up.
[219:58.01]Okay.
[220:00.85]Put food at the very top.
[220:04.83]That's fucking ridiculous.
[220:07.69]That's ridiculous.
[220:08.86]Can I make him sleep up here?
[220:11.02]I think I can make him sleep up here.
[220:13.56]What are lemurs like?
[220:18.97]Alright, hold on.
[220:19.43]Wait, wait.
[220:19.81]Let me get rid of this.
[220:27.47]Let's do a big board.
[220:28.25]Alright, this is just snapping too much.
[220:37.98]Game's having trouble here.
[220:40.48]Okay, I need to... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[220:59.40]Good.
[221:00.20]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[221:02.67]Just a little bit more.
[221:05.05]The game's crashing.
[221:05.71]Stop.
[221:07.17]No, just do one.
[221:07.91]The game, I'm actually, I'm almost just hard locked right there.
[221:17.40]Oh my god, it's so finicky.
[221:18.96]Okay.
[221:19.78]We need food.
[221:23.70]So we need, uh, habitat.
[221:25.94]This is, we need lemur, right?
[221:27.14]Okay.
[221:30.05]What the hell is this thing called?
[221:32.95]Save it, save it.
[221:33.51]I will, I will, don't worry.
[221:36.53]What kind of lemur was it?
[221:37.99]Red, roughed lemur?
[221:48.54]I want to put a bunch of boxes up here.
[221:51.52]So they can, like, throw beach balls and shit over the edge.
[221:55.34]Oh, come on, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[221:56.66]Please, stop it, please.
[222:01.74]Is it gonna be so fun for them?
[222:10.06]Okay.
[222:10.74]Now I need food.
[222:14.05]Where's the actual food?
[222:16.01]Bed and shelters.
[222:16.87]Okay.
[222:17.21]Here's a shelter.
[222:20.37]Medium.
[222:20.67]Okay.
[222:26.33]And then, uh, water.
[222:27.11]Water.
[222:34.00]Alright, it's gonna, it is gonna crash.
[222:35.14]It's gonna crash.
[222:35.58]It's gonna crash.
[222:36.02]I have to save it right now.
[222:38.64]Save again.
[222:46.00]Done.
[222:49.39]Okay.
[222:51.27]Wing-tailed lemur?
[222:52.65]What was it called?
[222:58.09]Red-ruffed lemur?
[223:00.23]Ring-tailed lemur?
[223:08.26]That's the same food, though.
[223:09.02]And they have the same toys.
[223:10.02]Okay, so I need a feeding platform.
[223:16.34]Shit.
[223:17.78]It's gotta be bigger.
[223:18.30]It's gotta be bigger than this.
[223:23.27]Shit.
[223:23.63]Okay, hold on.
[223:36.02]Stop.
[223:36.36]Come on.
[223:36.92]Don't.
[223:37.72]Got it.
[223:37.96]Right there.
[223:38.22]Okay.
[223:38.40]Good.
[223:40.22]Good.
[223:40.46]Perfect.
[223:53.48]And by the way, I'm putting like 50 lemurs inside of this.
[224:07.40]Need more access?
[224:08.42]I'll fix it.
[224:09.04]Don't worry.
[224:10.65]Feeding stations.
[224:11.89]Water station.
[224:12.42]Okay.
[224:14.08]I'll fix it.
[224:39.02]Okay.
[224:40.22]They can get up here, right?
[224:55.54]Forge box?
[224:57.60]Toys.
[224:57.92]Okay, wait.
[225:01.97]Block of ice?
[225:03.17]Sure.
[225:06.39]They won't be able to get up there?
[225:07.85]Why not?
[225:16.96]That was the funniest thing I've seen all night.
[225:19.07]The wind up there is going to be lethal.
[225:21.25]Yeah, it's gonna be like a hundred mile per hour winds up here.
[225:23.85]There's not enough air.
[225:29.86]Can I put oxygen up here?
[225:31.66]Okay, alright, I lost it.
[225:32.66]Where am I?
[225:35.85]Oh my god, this is gonna be fucking horrible.
[225:40.68]Where is it?
[225:41.66]Alright.
[225:42.76]Here we go.
[225:44.05]Now I just need to put like 50 to 100 lemurs in here.
[225:50.23]And we're gonna follow them.
[226:06.78]What is it called?
[226:07.20]Ring-tailed lemur?
[226:11.47]Ring-tailed lemur.
[226:13.24]Here we go.
[226:14.62]Yes, I'll take 50 of them, please.
[226:17.78]What?
[226:20.48]What do we mean, invalid destination?
[226:27.08]Oh, I need a door, right.
[226:31.92]I'm gonna fucking lose my mind.
[226:37.64]Habitat gate.
[226:40.06]Who cares?
[226:42.62]I mean, that was kind of cool.
[226:44.08]Ooh, I like that.
[226:44.98]Alright, habitat gate.
[226:47.61]Let's make them sure they're happy when they're in here.
[226:53.13]Alright, ring-tailed lemur.
[227:01.44]Ring-tailed lemur.
[227:25.94]The game is saved before this, so don't worry.
[227:27.69]When this goes to shit, don't worry.
[227:35.01]Do I have 10?
[227:47.10]Okay, let's get some females Here we go You need to make a rival tower?
[228:13.64]I can still press this button

[228:29.99]Okay.
[228:30.79]I can't do anymore.
[228:32.08]Alright.

[229:20.07]Diseased animal discovered.

[231:19.77]This enclosure is huge.
[231:21.82]They don't know what to do.
[231:28.90]Somebody's gonna go up there.
[231:29.82]Alright, let me make their environment better.
[231:31.86]Hold on, wait.
[231:34.28]Environment.
[231:34.74]We need some more plants.
[231:35.46]Alright, tropical biome plants.
[231:45.73]What?
[231:46.05]I need plants?
[231:46.59]No, not rocks.
[231:47.57]God damn it.

[232:22.09]Do you like those?
[232:25.69]You like those, right?
[232:29.37]Oh, you hate all this shit.
[232:30.57]God damn it.
[232:40.65]Okay, what do you- what do you want?
[232:47.25]Welfare enrichment.
[232:48.35]I know you have this enrichment right over there.
[232:49.69]Okay.
[232:50.49]So you like tropical Africa.
[232:52.75]Got it.
[232:52.99]Oh my god.
[233:04.80]Uh, no, that's too big.
[233:19.52]Put some over here.
[233:30.63]Dig this down to the ground a little bit.
[233:32.59]There.
[233:32.87]Alright, we're good.
[233:35.61]We're good.
[233:35.85]We're good.
[233:36.09]We're good.
[233:36.35]We're good.
[233:36.57]We're good.
[233:36.79]You got what you want.
[233:37.44]That's what you want.
[233:37.98]What else do you need?
[233:39.70]Climbable area.
[233:41.64]Um... Really?
[233:44.66]You need a climbable area?
[233:46.46]Sure.
[233:47.16]What the fuck are you talking about?
[233:49.35]Alright, we need short grass.
[233:54.22]Long grass.
[233:59.67]No, less long grass and more soil.
[234:21.16]Wrong stick?
[234:22.00]They can't climb that type?
[234:25.08]No.
[234:26.04]That's not true.
[234:26.92]Don't even say that.
[234:34.15]I don't believe that.
[234:34.99]I really don't.
[234:35.43]Okay, what else you guys want?
[234:39.91]Social.
[234:40.87]Space.
[234:41.54]Whatever.
[234:42.44]Enrichment.
[234:43.28]Okay.
[234:44.98]It's better than it was before.
[234:51.06]Wait.
[234:52.04]Javier the Titan Beetle has died.
[235:04.22]Do you not see what's over here?
[235:05.26]I just don't think they haven't seen it yet.
[235:12.74]No.
[235:12.96]Climbable platform.
[235:14.04]Climbable log.
[235:14.98]No.
[235:15.12]These are climbable.
[235:17.10]Absolutely they are.
[235:25.07]A new lemur's arrived.
[235:26.45]Alright, but... Get over there.
[235:34.50]These are for leopards?
[235:39.89]What?
[235:40.13]No, it's because it's raining out right now.
[235:46.49]That's the problem.
[235:55.92]Go on.
[236:01.82]I think somebody just had a... Okay, hold on.
[236:03.54]Move.
[236:03.72]What do you mean delivery is scheduled?
[236:14.23]That just threw him over there?
[236:15.41]Alright.
[236:19.65]Look what's right next to you.
[236:24.23]Look at that.
[236:25.01]Do you see it?
[236:27.60]It's right here.
[236:28.42]It's climbable.
[236:29.52]It's cool.
[236:30.12]You have to try it.
[236:30.94]He's looking at it.
[236:35.32]Come on.
[236:38.96]Come on.
[236:44.80]Throw him into the tower.
[236:45.87]That's not going to work.
[236:47.83]What if I go like this?
[236:48.85]Hold on.
[236:51.57]Hold on.
[236:53.07]Okay.
[236:53.29]I have an idea.
[236:54.45]I have an idea.
[236:56.25]Everybody hold on.
[237:04.03]Right?
[237:04.23]You know what I'm saying?
[237:22.00]How you doing on enrichment?
[237:28.54]What are you talking about?
[237:37.22]That's a lot of people.
[237:39.56]I just want you to climb this!
[237:41.90]How do you not know how to climb this?
[237:47.27]Toy enrichment, it's right here!
[238:07.04]Climb it!
[238:13.42]Oh shit, I locked him in the wood.
[238:21.85]Why won't you climb these?
[238:26.13]God damn it.
[238:27.61]No!
[238:28.73]Somebody's gonna jump on it, right?
[238:30.13]Are they not old enough?
[238:31.70]Can they not climb yet?
[238:36.55]Is it like a research thing?
[238:45.36]Get the leopards.
[238:47.06]Climbable log... See, but... It might be this.
[238:50.98]I think this is fucking everything up.
[238:59.86]Come on.
[239:12.03]Come on, somebody get on there.
[239:13.50]Filter the climbable logs by species.
[239:23.22]Yeah, they can climb these.
[239:27.26]I think I just went too high and it's all fucked up.
[239:34.51]Uh, I mean... This is not even part of an enclosure.
[239:44.47]I'm just waiting for one of them to accidentally jump on it though.
[239:48.41]Enrichment, come on.
[239:56.68]God damn it.
[239:57.84]No!
[239:59.26]Come on!
[239:59.90]Get on these!
[240:02.08]It's outside the fence?
[240:17.94]Oh, my God.
[240:52.26]If that's what it is, it could be, right?
[240:54.24]So... So what do I need to go to?
[241:05.19]Like, out... Oh, man.
[241:15.78]No, I spent so much time on that.
[241:18.02]It has to work once.
[241:21.40]It has to work one time.
[241:26.89]I'm just trying to keep it... I'm trying to make it so the... When it goes up, it stays in the enclosure.
[241:32.11]Maybe if I go across this way, it'll do it.
[241:45.09]I mean, is that in?
[241:50.36]It looks like it's out right here?
[241:55.69]It's gotta be like the whole park.
[241:57.83]Fuck.
[241:57.97]Alright, it's saved, it's saved.
[242:00.05]The game is saved, it's saved, it's saved.
[242:01.75]Don't worry, it's saved.
[242:05.30]I need to see if this works.
[242:31.38]No, if the game is saved, the game is saved.
[242:32.64]Don't worry.
[242:36.70]How do I get rid of an animal?
[242:46.81]Fuck!
[242:48.39]How do I get rid of an animal?
[242:54.65]Just leave it and forget it.
[242:56.67]But I need this to come out.
[242:57.77]I need to see if this works.
[243:00.41]I need to get these alligators to go for a minute.
[243:02.13]Just get out of the way.
[243:03.33]The game crashed.
[243:06.11]Oh, fuck me.
[243:07.01]Whatever.
[243:07.71]For the best.
[243:14.22]No!
[243:15.34]Oh, the lemur pole.
[243:17.34]Come on.
[243:18.00]Maybe if I load it back, it'll be alright.
[243:22.80]That's a good idea.
[243:30.37]I want to see them climb the tower.
[243:31.43]I want to see them climb the tower too.
[243:33.08]You know what I mean?
[243:33.84]The thing I was just trying to say.
[243:38.36]Just move a lemur up there?
[243:39.56]I don't think I can.
[243:43.52]Why is my planet coaster isn't turning on anymore?
[243:50.01]What is with this new Steam sucks?
[244:02.79]New Steam is like Battle.net.
[244:04.03]Alright, here it comes.
[244:14.26]Or maybe not.
[244:14.72]Maybe it'll, uh... Maybe it'll never open up again.
[244:18.77]I'm so sad right now.
[244:19.89]I really thought we were going to see the ultimate lemur feat of strength.
[244:29.37]Make a new tower from scratch with lemurs in so you can make sure it works.
[244:32.61]Fuck.
[244:32.97]But fuck.
[244:34.56]Fuck.
[244:35.30]Right?
[244:35.58]Like, that sucks.
[244:37.00]If that's what I gotta do, but that sucks.
[244:46.16]I gotta pee, too.
[244:46.90]I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[244:47.80]I should've done that from the start, but I got super into it.
[244:53.56]Okay, where's my, uh... I need to load the game.
[245:02.14]Was it Roach Ranch?
[245:03.10]Did I save it before the tower?
[245:25.65]Oh, this looks correct.
[245:26.33]Okay.
[245:27.71]So, here's what I have to do.
[245:29.17]Everybody's gonna be real... We're gonna be... This is sad.
[245:31.77]Serious injury discovered.
[245:33.13]This is... He's the animal.
[245:41.32]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[245:42.62]Load game.
[245:43.04]Load, load, load, load.
[245:44.12]Load zoo.
[245:45.44]It was tower.
[245:47.34]Yes, it was this one.
[245:53.26]So, I'm going to...
[245:57.62]I'm going to delete the tower.
[245:59.68]But look at how cool this is.
[246:06.49]Beach ball fell off.
[246:09.05]No.
[246:12.73]This is so sad.
[246:14.07]It really is, but it's terrible.
[246:17.09]But I have to do this.
[246:18.47]I'm sorry, everybody.
[246:20.70]I'm sorry.
[246:21.98]We need to do it.
[246:27.75]Yep.
[246:28.63]Sucks.
[246:53.76]Alright, just pretend it didn't happen.
[246:55.14]We're gonna go.
[246:55.54]Here we go.
[246:56.84]Alright, so that didn't happen.
[246:58.82]This did not happen.
[246:59.56]Nothing happened.
[247:04.66]Blueprint a tower?
[247:08.83]Can I do that?
[247:12.05]Alright, here we go.
[247:13.59]I'm gonna put some lemurs in here.
[247:14.73]Let's get one in here.
[247:15.55]Let's go for it.
[247:19.07]Animal trading.
[247:26.80]It's okay.
[247:30.52]Ring-tailed lemur.
[247:33.76]Invalidistic- Okay, it needs a door.
[247:35.50]I remember this part.
[247:40.02]And you know what?
[247:41.42]Edit this whole barrier.
[247:42.44]This is wrong, too.
[247:43.06]This is an electric fence.
[247:49.84]Alright, this is gonna be- What is it?
[247:51.18]Wood?
[247:52.95]Just concrete?
[248:03.36]Concrete?
[248:04.74]Glass?
[248:09.10]Okay, good.
[248:09.68]Done.
[248:12.60]So now this is normal now.
[248:14.19]This is not fucked up.
[248:17.15]Let's get a lemur in here.
[248:18.01]Let's get a door on here first, please.
[248:19.33]Okay, cool.
[248:31.88]Lemur.
[248:35.35]We're gonna start small.
[248:39.86]I gotta pee so bad, but I can't stop playing this game.
[248:42.40]I gotta pee in my pants.
[248:43.74]Who cares, whatever, right?
[248:45.52]I'm in my own house.
[248:49.00]What is it?
[248:51.30]Ring-tailed lemur.
[248:54.00]Come on in.
[248:56.59]Let's just do one.
[249:00.95]Terrain?
[249:01.87]No, not terrain.
[249:02.53]I need this to be soil, right?
[249:06.41]Habitat.
[249:07.07]Okay, no, no, no, no.
[249:08.11]How do I do just... Where is it?
[249:10.52]The hell is it?
[249:12.74]God damn it.
[249:13.20]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[249:14.12]Fuck.
[249:14.67]Okay, I'll be right back.
[249:15.47]I'll be right back.
[249:16.43]I'll be right back.
[249:17.05]Just chill.
[249:17.41]I'll be right back.
[249:18.13]Pause on the game.
[250:34.80]Thank you.
[251:12.30]you
[251:40.38]Thank you.
[252:50.22]Okay.
[252:55.96]You know when you're peeing?
[252:59.50]And it just will not stop.
[253:03.32]I hate that.
[253:05.56]That's the worst.
[253:07.14]You do a full piss.
[253:09.37]And after you're done.
[253:11.67]I'm done.
[253:12.47]I'm done peeing.
[253:13.29]It's over.
[253:13.85]I know how that feels.
[253:16.05]It's just still going.
[253:18.45]And then it starts again.
[253:20.01]And you're just sitting there going like, let's go.
[253:24.17]Hurry up.
[253:24.97]I'm just sitting here.
[253:26.71]It's boring.
[253:35.73]You should see a doctor.
[253:37.47]I've been to the doctor like 15 times in the last like six months.
[253:41.47]I've been there plenty of times.
[253:42.37]Don't you worry.
[253:44.55]Thanks for the information.
[253:45.43]I've just been looking out for you guys.
[253:48.76]Alright, so, where we last left off, uh, hold on, I've got to make a text here.
[254:00.90]Okay, let's go.
[254:05.70]I was going to get a lemur in here, and then, I was going to, what was I going to do?
[254:10.32]I don't remember.
[254:14.16]Oh yeah, I was going to change it.
[254:14.98]Let's just get the lemur in here first.
[254:19.75]Lemur incoming.
[254:28.28]We will slowly work on their habitat.
[254:37.06]What happened to the treehouse?
[254:39.16]It was a waste of time because they wouldn't climb it because I broke the game.
[254:43.99]But now... Okay.
[254:46.69]Here we go.
[254:48.26]enrichment it may have been the food on top too I don't know let's do uh let's pause it okay habitat this is we're looking for a ring-tailed lemur cool uh let's we got a feeding a little feeding zone over here over by the inevitable tower
[255:16.69]cool let's put like two of them and then let's do um water you know some water bowls okay we'll get the feeding stations water stations uh their welfare let's take a look at their so we want some uh Africa tropical
[255:48.81]No, it's going to be... Tropical.
[255:55.73]Africa.
[255:57.85]Cool.
[255:58.71]Okay.
[255:59.19]We're going to slowly do this correctly.
[256:02.15]That looks nice.
[256:06.14]A little tree coming in from there.
[256:12.62]Nice.
[256:13.12]Cool.
[256:13.44]Alright, we'll put one of these over here.
[256:23.01]I'm just trying to do this correct.
[256:29.09]Uhh, some bushes.
[256:30.66]Bushes over here.
[256:34.94]Almost there.
[256:37.58]Need some more coverage.
[256:43.41]Get some of the bigger ones.
[256:52.65]Okay.
[256:53.93]Nice.
[256:54.27]Let's do one more here.
[256:57.21]Now, your terrain.
[256:59.67]Shelter space is critically insufficient.
[257:03.13]Terrain is wrong.
[257:04.81]It's grass and soil.
[257:08.30]So we need a shitload of soil.
[257:15.18]Soil light.
[257:18.80]Make this huge and just do the whole damn thing.
[257:30.38]Okay.
[257:31.78]Good.
[257:32.38]Short grass.
[257:35.78]Perfect.
[257:36.71]Shelter.
[257:41.65]Where is your shelter?
[257:43.11]Here it is.
[257:44.91]Basic shelter.
[257:49.99]Very nice.
[257:51.55]Place to sleep.
[258:03.23]What's wrong with this?
[258:03.89]What's wrong with this?
[258:05.86]Why is it still zero?
[258:08.16]How is it zero?
[258:32.25]They want privacy?
[258:35.49]What?
[258:43.11]Where's this lemur?
[258:45.43]Where are you?
[258:48.91]Okay, no, habitat's fine.
[258:49.99]Okay.
[258:51.55]Enrichment.
[258:54.81]Yeah, that's fine.
[258:55.33]Okay.
[258:55.93]Enrichment.
[258:57.13]Here we go.
[258:59.06]I'm gonna start right here.
[259:03.10]Let's see if this does anything.
[259:04.22]Pause it.
[259:07.79]Climbing.
[259:09.51]Climbable log.
[259:12.27]Climbable log.
[259:16.47]Where's the ten foot one?
[259:18.26]Two meters.
[259:18.82]This is one.
[259:19.58]Six meters.
[259:21.10]Here we go.
[259:22.44]Does it show up?
[259:32.40]No.
[259:33.32]Why?
[259:45.09]Why?
[259:54.37]Why does this not work?
[260:04.67]This is, it's not, look, ring-tailed lemur, look!
[260:27.67]So what the fuck, climb it!
[260:37.74]Alright, so... Climb it!
[260:43.40]Climbing isn't enrichment.
[260:47.60]Well, you're good to go.
[260:48.28]Okay, so hold on.
[260:58.71]It's probably because it's raining.
[261:02.37]It's definitely because it's raining.
[261:04.69]Right?
[261:07.63]Is that really what it was?
[261:08.39]Alright, it's a sunny day.
[261:17.11]What are you doing?
[261:18.73]Do something.
[261:19.15]Have fun.
[261:19.57]Alright.
[261:21.27]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[261:21.85]Okay, where are you going?
[261:32.24]Cool.
[261:32.60]Okay.
[261:36.45]He just doesn't want to do exercise.
[261:37.99]Maybe he'll eat.
[261:42.85]Put in more.
[261:44.61]Let's get some more.
[261:46.33]The second that one of them decides to climb, I'm pausing it and doing a tower to the sky.
[261:54.20]Look, I have these things here too.
[261:55.26]Alright, let's get a couple more in here.
[262:03.77]Alright, animal training.
[262:05.49]Lemurs.
[262:06.71]Two, just like four of them.
[262:07.81]That's all we need.
[262:13.17]Alright, let's do like two females.
[262:22.31]And then, I don't know, one, another male?
[262:26.49]One more male?
[262:32.74]That sounds good to me.
[262:38.11]Okay.
[262:38.65]Are you climbing?
[262:42.27]What?
[262:42.65]Alright, come on.
[262:43.31]Go for it.
[262:44.99]Somebody climb this fucking pole, please.
[262:56.44]Okay, wait.
[262:57.10]Other animals need to be seen.
[263:04.68]I thought somebody just walked in here.
[263:05.88]Okay.
[263:09.97]Somebody climb, please.
[263:14.09]Go!
[263:18.71]Somebody have some fun.
[263:20.35]Do something fun!
[263:21.47]Are you gonna go for fun?
[263:33.87]Check the climbable area.
[263:35.43]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[263:38.36]Okay.
[263:38.70]Alright, alright, alright.
[263:39.60]Stay there, stay there.
[263:40.32]Don't move, don't move, don't move.
[263:41.22]Here we go.
[263:48.54]Got a raid?
[263:50.26]Oh, we did.
[263:51.60]Lazy Purple!
[263:53.22]Thanks for the raid.
[263:55.82]That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
[263:59.74]Thanks, Lazy Purple.
[264:00.42]Appreciate that.
[264:06.43]It's going all the way back.
[264:08.71]Team Fortress 2.
[264:09.61]Damn.
[264:10.91]Well, I hope your stream was good.
[264:15.49]Not sure what you were doing, but we're doing... Welcome, everybody.
[264:19.83]We are doing... Well, this is Planet Zoo, but... It's not really Planet Zoo.
[264:26.84]It's called... Giant Cat Tower.
[264:31.34]If you stick around for another 45 minutes to 2 hours, you might see the outcome of how it works.
[264:39.91]But thank you.
[264:40.57]Welcome, everybody.
[264:45.14]Let's see if I can make this happen.
[264:47.68]You're the one.
[264:48.40]You're the chosen one.
[264:50.60]Here we go.
[264:54.98]Where is it?
[264:55.46]Habitat.
[264:56.76]Climbable.
[264:58.44]Here we go.
[264:59.00]Climbable log.
[264:59.80]Six meters.
[265:01.34]Let's do this right.
[265:03.37]Let's get it right fucking in front of you.
[265:07.85]Here we go.
[265:09.88]Why did this turn away?
[265:12.44]This has to be perfect.
[265:14.48]How can I get this to be perfect?
[265:17.54]Angle snap?
[265:20.14]Yep.
[265:36.69]I gotta make sure this is going in a straight line up.
[265:44.64]This is actually not going to be too bad.
[265:48.30]I can do two at a time.
[265:56.40]Three at a time, actually.
[265:57.06]This is going to take way less time.
[266:01.23]Is it leaning?
[266:01.69]No, it's not.
[266:07.91]I can fix it.
[266:08.97]Is it leaning?
[266:09.75]No, it's not.
[266:10.15]Is it leaning?
[266:10.71]Is it leaning?
[266:11.13]I can't tell.
[266:11.61]Are you lying to me?
[266:13.60]No, it's not leaning.
[266:14.30]It's fine.
[266:14.66]I had it too.
[266:17.16]Shouldn't have listened.
[266:18.72]Okay, I gotta get like... This is where it gets hard.
[266:23.55]Somebody's gonna do this.
[266:27.11]I guarantee it.
[266:54.59]Wait, see if it actually climbs it?
[267:00.23]Um, good idea.
[267:08.15]Did it go up?
[267:08.57]Did it go up?
[267:09.07]I can't see.
[267:09.49]Is it dark?
[267:10.29]It's too dark.
[267:10.93]I can't see.
[267:11.41]Did it go up?
[267:14.31]It's so dark out right now.
[267:15.52]I don't even know where he is.
[267:22.66]Why is the zoo open at like 2 o'clock in the fucking morning?
[267:25.32]Tell me if you see any movement.
[267:41.16]Oh, get... Oh my god, what happened?
[267:43.30]Oh, okay.
[267:46.64]What?
[267:51.47]Alright, somebody get up there and climb that, please.
[267:54.17]Don't make this be a complete waste of my time.
[268:01.93]Any more lemurs in here?
[268:02.73]Come on, get up there, please.
[268:04.69]I just need you to climb it.
[268:20.22]They're not dead.
[268:20.86]They're fine.
[268:21.36]They're over here playing around.
[268:31.73]Oh, it looked like you were going over to it.
[268:34.15]They need incentive.
[268:35.03]It's not gonna be... Leopards are not gonna climb it.
[268:52.66]Fuck!
[268:53.60]I'm so disappointed.
[269:01.55]Make some platforms?
[269:02.43]I'll try that.
[269:05.71]One climbed up earlier.
[269:06.67]Yeah, I know.
[269:07.21]That's why it's like... It's definitely possible.
[269:10.17]Let's do some platforms.
[269:12.28]Climbable ramp.
[269:14.28]Or a climbable platform.
[269:22.37]Somebody get over here and just climb that and go from here to here and there to there.
[269:26.67]Right?
[269:26.97]Somebody just do it.
[269:31.39]It's raining again.
[269:32.47]No, it ain't raining again.
[269:34.43]Because I say so.
[269:41.26]How do I turn this off?
[269:47.83]I'm giving this like 30 to 40 more seconds and then I'm moving on.
[269:53.89]Get rid of all this shit.
[270:00.73]Oh, this is possible.
[270:05.03]Thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it.
[270:06.89]Where are you going?
[270:12.63]No, do that over here.
[270:14.70]Over this way.
[270:19.98]You idiot.
[270:21.26]Why were the other lemurs so much more climbing?
[270:24.02]They climbed.
[270:24.76]They climbed so...
[270:50.57]Where'd he go?
[270:54.33]What?
[271:03.74]What?
[271:06.94]The animals are all die- Well, this is- Alright, I'm done.
[271:09.46]I'm done.
[271:10.84]I tried to make the tower and none of them want to climb it.
[271:13.60]They don't want to even go over here.
[271:15.78]We had lemurs in the last game and all they did was jump around in circles.
[271:22.61]Alright, back to the real game.
[271:23.92]Oh, that's so disappointing.
[271:27.58]When you try to do something like that, it just fucking doesn't play out.
[271:30.14]That's disappointing!
[271:45.85]It's a zoo, not a circus.
[271:47.39]I know.
[271:49.52]Alright, I'm still doing lemurs.
[271:50.64]Oh, fuck.
[271:52.12]I forgot it was here still.
[271:57.21]Somebody climb it, please!
[271:59.29]Climb it!
[272:01.11]I need you to climb it, please!
[272:05.71]Alright, hold on.
[272:06.37]It's a diseased animal.
[272:08.63]We have a vet, right?
[272:09.57]Alright, I gotta check around and make sure everything's alright.
[272:17.38]Let's take a look at the animal list.
[272:22.98]What's going on here?
[272:24.38]Alright.
[272:24.87]All the bugs are in bad shape.
[272:30.19]It's because they all hate the environment.
[272:31.55]I know.
[272:33.11]Well, I'm going to release half of them into the wild, so who cares?
[272:37.37]It's this one.
[272:41.65]They don't like to be together.
[272:44.59]There are too many giant cockroaches in here.
[272:50.13]So I'm going to get rid of them.
[272:53.29]Would beetle die?
[272:53.95]Dude, that one's fine.
[272:57.27]Alright, I'm gonna get in here and I'm gonna delete half these beetles.
[273:14.76]Okay, release to the wild.
[273:23.41]Wait, did I just let him out of the cage?
[273:24.63]Is that all I did?
[273:26.87]Alright, there's still a problem socially in here?
[273:28.59]Why?
[273:30.35]How many are in here?
[273:33.25]There's so many in here.
[273:45.99]Fifteen.
[273:46.55]Fifteen.
[273:47.03]Fifteen.
[273:48.77]Fifteen.
[273:49.43]Alright, we'll keep like two in here.
[273:54.65]Better.
[273:55.09]Alright, now we're good.
[273:56.35]Back here.
[273:56.75]Uh, everyone else is okay.
[274:00.39]Everyone's happy.
[274:03.44]A beetle did just die.
[274:04.44]What is that?
[274:04.82]Well, I was just smoking.
[274:07.66]What is this?
[274:08.08]What's going on?
[274:08.54]Call a mechanic over here, please.
[274:19.39]That person had ten umbrellas.
[274:24.66]What's wrong now?
[274:26.86]Tickets are underpriced.
[274:29.37]Okay.
[274:35.39]Not anymore.
[274:35.79]Alright, so I have this.
[274:42.23]I have my... This is the lemur place.
[274:44.80]And it's all... It's just too... It's too much.
[274:47.58]I'm gonna keep this in the very rare event that the lemurs actually give a shit and do something with it.
[274:51.98]So we're gonna do an actual lemur enclosure.
[274:55.91]Oh, we're gonna delete this.
[274:56.67]Is this electric fence still?
[274:59.37]Yeah, this can't be electric fence.
[275:01.71]Do leopards instead.
[275:03.23]Or, like, chimps?
[275:07.98]What's the... Hold on, wait, will I get an orangutan climb, then?
[275:14.20]No, you guys got me stuck on this shit.
[275:15.94]Alright, hold on.
[275:18.79]I'm really quiet.
[275:19.91]What?
[275:21.73]Shouldn't be.
[275:22.83]Maybe I am.
[275:23.49]I'm also just leaning back, too.
[275:28.55]Do leopards or chimps.
[275:30.27]Alright, I'm going to do chimpanzees.
[275:31.49]God damn it.
[275:32.57]Alright, no, no, no, no.
[275:33.59]This is going to be a chimpanzee enclosure that happens to have a huge tower.
[275:38.31]Okay?
[275:47.06]Cut it off here.
[275:56.31]This is too big.
[275:59.09]Now it's not so huge.
[276:10.70]This is going to be a chimpanzee enclosure.
[276:17.24]Maybe even a little bit smaller, from like here to here.
[276:18.80]That looks good.
[276:28.94]Done.
[276:29.88]Okay.
[276:30.14]I think the wall's bigger.
[276:36.05]I'm going to select everything.
[276:42.87]Up.
[276:44.21]Like, I don't know, five feet?
[276:45.56]Ten feet?
[276:46.04]Whatever.
[276:46.42]Five meters?
[276:46.92]That's fine.
[276:51.58]Chip is going to just break through the... What are they going to do?
[276:53.26]Shoulder tackle the glass and smash it open?
[277:00.38]Make it as tall as the tower.
[277:03.00]I can't do that.
[277:09.44]That's not possible.
[277:10.28]So, sorry.
[277:12.43]Okay.
[277:15.67]Now... We need some... Can chimpanzees climb that?
[277:22.05]Let's just check it.
[277:22.77]This is for a chimpanzee.
[277:40.12]Western chimpanzee?
[277:42.34]Okay, they can climb this.
[277:44.06]Okay.
[277:45.45]Okay, it's possible.
[277:53.51]Reinforced concrete?
[277:56.45]What thing climbs the most out of anything in the whole game?
[278:00.66]Bonobo?
[278:01.24]Bonobos?
[278:03.52]Reinforced concrete.
[278:11.14]Okay.
[278:11.72]Good.
[278:15.56]So now I need... Bonobo?
[278:22.71]Make the habitat small so they don't have anywhere else to go.
[278:24.41]And this is fine.
[278:28.10]Okay.
[278:28.90]You're saying... Bon... A Bonobo.

[279:08.02]Let me just see if they'll even go on it first.
[279:12.45]By the way, I have so much... Guys, you have no idea how bad I hope this works.
[279:22.07]More than anything.
[279:24.17]This has to work.

[279:31.50]It's too far.
[279:32.18]I'm too...
[279:36.26]God damn it.
[279:48.01]Put food at top.
[279:49.01]No, I'll put like toys and shit at the top.

[282:07.39]No, I'm not... I'm trying to move on, but I can't move on.
[282:11.19]I'm just trying to make a chimpanzee enclosure.
[282:13.25]If they climb it, they climb it.
[282:14.15]I don't fucking care.
[282:14.63]What's going on?
[282:15.03]Hold on.
[282:16.25]Tickets are overpriced now.
[282:17.33]Okay, well, sorry.
[282:22.65]There.

[282:42.40]Oh my fucking god.
[282:51.13]How do I go up?
[283:28.96]Why can't I turn it?
[283:30.06]I don't know.
[283:37.70]Wait.

[283:48.78]Can I get the Terminator vision turned off?
[283:50.79]I don't ever want to see that again.
[284:06.89]It's gotta be the other way.
[284:09.59]I thought a solar panel had to be connect- like, on top.
[284:15.29]That's so ugly.
[284:18.53]Why can't- spin it!
[284:19.87]I can't turn- why can I not turn this?
[284:21.73]I can't- I- I can't turn it.
[284:30.00]I cannot spin this.
[284:30.90]This is facing this way permanently.
[284:32.08]It has to face the sun.
[284:35.77]Alright.

[287:54.59]Looking good.
[287:55.13]Okay.
[287:58.29]I need them to come in, then I'm going to do some... I'm going to dress it up.
[288:03.43]Multiple animals have low welfare.
[288:05.56]Oh, come on.
[288:06.28]What's wrong here?
[288:10.10]Nutrition.
[288:10.64]Social health.
[288:13.20]The group size is too large.
[288:14.62]What do you mean it's too large?
[288:15.84]Aren't there like two in here?
[288:19.08]How many are in here?
[288:22.92]There's 13 scorpions in here.
[288:28.51]They've been having children.

[289:23.34]That's not my fault.
[289:24.24]That's not my problem.
[289:25.00]Alright.
[289:25.60]What do you like and what do you not like?
[289:29.58]Oh!
[289:34.57]Social.
[289:36.03]Enrichment.

[302:34.07]This is so many people.
[302:36.59]It's like the most interesting thing.
[302:38.85]They're running back and forth.

[303:59.44]Nobody's listening at all.
[304:02.98]You just came back.
[304:03.84]How can you be diseased again?
[304:06.76]What does this mean?

[305:38.72]Okay, are you healed?
[305:44.18]Okay, space, nutrition, social.
[305:46.02]We need more of those monkeys to come back.
[305:47.64]Ugh.
[306:04.47]Just buy more monkeys?
[306:05.59]No, they're okay.
[306:16.88]So what's- what's wrong here?
[306:19.64]They don't have enough climbing area.
[306:21.04]Okay, well, sure, I'll add some.
[306:30.43]Is that- okay, now- okay, that counts!
[306:36.41]Somebody's gonna accidentally jump on that.
[306:38.01]There you go.
[306:40.05]Here's their whole area.
[306:41.11]Someone's gonna actually... They're gonna accidentally jump on this and go up.
[306:47.12]Shelter?
[306:47.82]Oh, fuck.
[306:48.22]They don't have any beds.
[306:50.18]Oh.
[306:51.06]Right.
[306:52.04]Okay.
[306:52.36]That was a mistake.
[306:54.20]Okay.
[306:54.68]Shit.
[306:55.06]That's why... That's the... That's the problem.
[306:57.40]No beds.
[307:10.94]Oh my god.
[307:13.26]Is this a field trip?
[307:14.44]Why are there so many people coming up here?
[307:17.68]It's not ready.
[307:18.72]Okay, we got enough.
[307:31.17]Alright.
[307:32.59]They're all happy now.
[307:34.68]Put some beds.
[307:42.85]Okay.
[307:44.11]Maybe they'll be happy now.
[307:48.08]Alright, not terrible.
[307:49.62]But you have a disease again.
[307:57.27]I'm just...
[308:04.46]Animal is hungry.
[308:07.58]Why won't somebody feed the... Get in there!
[308:14.44]Hurry the fuck up and feed him!
[308:21.21]I need to... Wait, okay, wait, wait, this is important.
[308:25.15]Pause it.
[309:13.88]I need a kiosk.
[309:19.41]Because seriously, I need a donation thing or an information booth.
[309:25.96]At least like an education board.
[309:43.13]No, not advanced movement.
[309:44.55]Get... No, you know what?
[309:51.71]I appreciate the actual lizard vision that they give you.

[310:01.08]I really love the change to dog eyes cam.
[310:23.74]Oh, I don't care.
[310:24.46]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[310:29.48]Who gives a shit?
[310:48.42]Where are my controls for this?
[310:56.67]Don't I have a list of controls?
[310:58.33]Where'd they go?
[310:58.77]Usually it's in the corner.
[311:00.57]Where the hell is it?
[311:06.37]Where are my controls?
[311:10.19]To like rotate and snapping and where the fuck is it?
[311:12.71]Why is it not here?
[311:33.09]Where are my goddamn controls?
[311:34.41]I don't even care.
[311:52.73]Whatever.
[311:53.01]I just need electricity to go over here.
[311:58.29]I apparently lost... I lost my lower right UI panel.
[312:08.57]Hold on.
[312:08.87]Facilities.
[312:09.51]Power.
[312:11.49]First let's do some speakers.
[312:14.55]Over here.
[312:15.61]And over here.
[312:16.17]Okay.
[312:19.46]Power.
[312:19.86]Oh my fucking god.
[312:28.99]Why do they put power in this game?
[312:38.75]This is on behalf of fucking utilities, really?
[312:41.91]I gotta put, like, transformers around?
[312:43.49]Wh-whatever.
[312:46.80]I don't care.
[312:56.92]He's joining the dark side.
[313:01.59]No, but why do I have to put, like, power connections?
[313:04.07]That wasn't in Planet Coaster.
[313:11.54]It's just like a middleman.
[313:12.94]Alright, I think the screen is actually... Fucking, I don't care.
[313:22.82]You're gonna have to lean forward.
[313:24.98]You have to lean forward and turn your neck this way.
[313:29.61]It's for the monkeys, alright?
[313:31.31]We're gonna put TV shows on there.
[313:32.91]We're gonna give them a Netflix remote and see whatever they put on.
[313:35.33]Who cares?
[313:37.56]Uh, 5,000 bits just came in from YesIsOnline.
[313:40.54]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[313:41.52]It's a monkey will climb if you believe in it.
[313:45.85]Go, monkey, go.
[313:52.13]Just turn on my stream.
[313:53.19]Okay, well, they have information here now.
[313:58.67]Cool.
[313:59.73]Where did you go?
[314:03.59]Why...
[314:09.40]Come on, do it!
[314:11.48]Look at how cool this is.
[314:12.82]It connects now.
[314:14.36]Someone's going to do it.
[314:15.53]I guarantee it.
[314:16.17]Let me just do this.
[314:20.47]Let me connect it over here.
[314:29.41]Why are they doing that?
[314:38.66]OK, now they're all connected.
[314:41.00]Alright, so what's going on here?
[315:08.02]How you guys doing?
[315:09.72]You want, uh, too few adults.
[315:16.31]Well, I can throw a couple more in there.
[315:17.91]Let's close this.
[315:18.63]Let me see what else is going on in the park.
[315:23.57]Oh, donation.
[315:24.34]I didn't do a donation thing.
[315:25.28]That could have been a thousand dollars already.
[315:37.62]Alright, give me some money.
[315:40.50]Give me some money.
[315:42.44]Well, not you guys, them.
[315:45.75]This looks like it's okay.
[315:46.83]Quantity.
[315:50.75]Are the keepers even coming in here?
[315:52.47]This is a keeper right here.
[315:53.45]We haven't got anywhere to prepare the animal's food.
[316:02.02]What are you even talking about?
[316:03.08]There's food here.
[316:13.85]Why are they in boxes?
[316:17.37]That guy came in here and dropped them in here.
[316:22.65]Okay, keeper hut.
[316:29.08]Let's do classic large keeper hut.
[316:34.18]Let's put it this way.
[316:36.52]Away from everything.
[316:41.83]We'll connect it down here.
[316:46.08]Can that reach the cellar?
[316:53.02]No.
[316:56.46]I'll just put another one.
[317:02.11]This needs power.
[317:02.99]And this needs to come down.
[317:24.44]Well, I'm just gonna wrap this around.
[317:25.60]This is temporary.
[317:47.93]Rare Pepe.
[317:48.57]Thanks for the five community subs.
[317:49.65]Thanks a lot.
[317:56.97]Dodged.
[317:57.42]Alright.
[317:59.80]I need to put another power source here.
[318:03.74]Are we climbing?
[318:11.03]Why don't you be stupid enough to do it?
[318:18.31]They keep getting diseased.
[318:19.55]I need someone to research this.
[318:25.94]Listeriosis?
[318:28.42]Research complete.
[318:30.20]Alright, well, so what the hell's the problem?
[318:34.38]It's already done.
[318:41.27]AdventureMFDan, thanks for the five subs.
[318:42.87]Appreciate it, Dan.
[318:45.87]This power source has failed.
[319:03.20]Cleanliness.

[319:22.13]Thank you guys, seriously.
[319:23.53]Alright, I need to open up... Fix that habitat.
[319:29.47]So I need someone to clean this.
[319:32.33]Maintenance.
[319:34.09]Time since last minute.
[319:35.13]Has nobody gone in here?
[319:37.23]You have no keepers assigned to a work zone containing this habitat.
[319:41.07]Why is nobody going in here?
[320:01.95]Am I insane or did the music just get louder for the last, like, 30 minutes?
[320:12.25]Five more subs from David saved it.
[320:15.33]Thank you, David.
[320:17.09]Thanks for saving it.
[320:18.77]Thank you.

[320:40.02]And actually try, eventually.
[320:41.32]I don't know.
[320:44.04]It's alright.
[320:44.40]We're doing fine.
[320:46.20]This needs to be clean.
[320:46.88]Get the fuck in there.

[322:11.11]These all have power, right?
[322:14.81]I have two staff rooms.
[322:22.37]This thing still will not be cleaned.
[322:30.65]Why won't somebody clean this fucking habitat?
[322:33.05]What are you... Do something.

[323:11.00]Please.
[323:11.94]Come on!
[323:12.44]I was thinking it might be possible.
[323:19.76]Okay, so I have no idea why this won't happen.
[323:26.51]Why there's something wrong here.
[323:27.83]I don't know why.
[323:31.30]A keeper has come in here like 10 times.
[323:32.96]There's one in here now.
[323:34.76]And he's just leaving.
[323:43.50]Water treatment, maybe?
[323:45.50]Maybe that's right.
[323:47.91]Water treatment.
[323:50.81]Where the fuck am I supposed to put this?
[323:56.15]In the enclosure with them?
[324:01.54]I can't.
[324:06.05]Oh, shit.
[324:06.79]What the fuck did I just do?
[324:09.41]Well, let me move it then.
[324:14.99]Let me see.
[324:23.35]Well, it's still hitting it, so... Although, I need it to... I guess it is fine over here.
[324:31.88]No, because they need to be able to get to it.
[324:38.42]Is that good enough?
[324:40.30]Down, like, here?
[324:40.93]Let's see if that's... Okay.
[324:45.99]I guess that's it.
[324:46.45]It's treating this body of water.
[324:47.57]Alright.

[370:32.23]This person.
[370:34.62]Okay, uh, let's do another enclosure.
[370:44.54]I think there needs to be something more back here besides just the, uh, the monkeys, you know?
[370:49.74]I mean, it's really cool.
[370:53.30]People can hang out up here.
[370:55.41]And, oh, right, that's fucked up, but it's okay.
[370:57.93]It's for them anyway.
[370:58.71]Alright, well, I'll do the rats.
[371:02.63]So, you can either go, you can stay here, or you can come... No, we'll put it right here.
[371:09.19]It'll go right here.
[371:09.99]That'll fit, right?
[371:11.95]It should.
[371:13.91]They definitely don't need anything.
[371:15.01]They need, like, a chain link fence.
[371:18.61]Or, like, a wood.
[371:24.36]Wood logs, chain link fence.
[371:33.89]They have rats, for God's sake.
[371:45.70]Alright, that looks good.
[371:49.52]Put the entrance over... No... Well, it's going to be people looking down.
[372:03.71]No, it's gonna be here.
[372:04.69]This way.
[372:06.11]Okay.
[372:06.81]I'll fix it in a minute.
[372:08.95]No, just do it now.
[372:11.03]That's way too thick.
[372:33.46]Thin it out a little, Jeremy.
[372:34.98]Thin it out a little.
[372:36.47]And then we'll wrap this around.
[372:37.83]We'll go here.
[372:39.55]Okay, because then there's a little staff room here.
[372:44.37]Although they have to go a long way to get in here.
[372:46.81]But, well, fuck them, whatever.
[372:49.44]They'll figure it out.
[372:51.22]So then this is the viewing angle.
[372:52.66]Let's get some rats in here.
[372:55.24]Is someone in here already?
[372:56.54]Okay.
[373:04.12]Does he throw shit over the fence?
[373:12.65]Okay.

[375:12.67]Let me think of what had happened already.
[375:21.36]This is a really bad design.
[375:22.68]I feel like these are everybody that's standing around waiting for the airplane.
[375:29.56]With their row to be called.
[375:30.94]It's like, sit down.
[375:34.60]Okay?

[375:54.85]God.
[376:06.61]Alright, let's, uh... Fighting due to incorrect sex.

[376:56.31]Okay, we need long grass.
[376:59.53]No, we don't want long grass.
[377:00.55]We need rocks.
[377:01.27]We need short grass.
[377:13.95]Short grass.

[377:46.69]And diseased.
[377:48.03]I don't know why they always have a disease.
[377:59.46]Alright, well, let's do... Let's get them happy.

[397:24.13]It's not going to work unless it needs to... I don't even know what to do with this.
[397:31.23]Okay.

[397:37.45]I'm going to have to leave.
[397:45.66]Okay.
[397:46.46]So, I am going to... We need a climbable ramp.
[397:51.36]Climbable platform...
[397:54.45]Okay, what if I just do little ones like this?
[397:57.29]Because these are platforms, they're not ramps.
[398:03.48]Climbable ramp.
[398:04.68]Okay, here we go.
[398:06.08]I have to turn this, and I have to make it lower, but I don't know how to do that.
[398:19.79]Okay, so I need to go into the advanced building options, which are, was it not control?
[398:27.85]Yeah, it's advanced building mode.
[398:34.30]But how do I do advanced building mode here?
[398:36.20]Okay, angle snap, here we go.
[398:37.66]30 degrees, no.
[398:43.91]No, not 45.
[398:44.73]I gotta do the advanced mode.
[398:51.47]Maybe I can just do it afterwards.
[398:52.57]No, because I don't want to make it part of the structure.
[398:59.81]Is it X?
[399:02.63]Okay, there we go.
[399:04.34]Okay.
[399:05.54]Let's do the rotation.

[399:30.48]What?
[400:07.00]Is that enough?
[400:09.44]I think that's enough.
[400:11.82]Maybe a little bit higher.
[400:17.55]OK.
[400:23.43]Can he jump from here?
[400:33.53]Making it a little one, okay.
[400:34.95]I'm sorry, I'm like, my head is, I fucking am like dying right now.

[401:27.70]He can't jump.
[401:28.40]Okay, one more.
[401:29.28]One more.
[401:49.54]It was so funny because he was so slow climbing up the thing.
[402:15.92]They're both so slow.
[402:17.68]Alright, are they gonna do it?
[402:21.54]You going for it?
[402:35.07]Thinking about it.

[403:30.25]You can do it.
[403:31.03]It's right there.
[403:31.87]It's in your grasp.
[403:32.84]Just go for it.
[403:34.44]You can do it.
[403:35.10]I know you can.
[403:35.98]Do it!
[403:37.69]I know you can do it!
[403:42.33]Delete the things behind them when they go up, but it'll... No, no, you can't, because it'll put them in a cage.
[403:49.30]This is it!
[403:49.80]This is it, go!
[403:54.18]No!
[404:11.29]You can't do it!

[412:45.20]Ah, this is wrong.
[412:58.19]Why does it have to do this?
[413:04.39]Alright, let's see what happens.

[413:43.48]What is that?
[413:46.46]What is this?
[413:47.24]Is that a cat?
[413:49.95]Why is the lion going?
[413:57.11]It's like a pig.
[413:58.13]Nobody's gonna leave.
[414:04.52]Nobody's gonna escape.
[414:15.37]Look at this guy.
[414:17.11]Uh oh, what's next?
[414:24.71]An elephant.
[414:25.39]He's going for it.
[414:26.07]Nope, no one's leaving.
[414:29.13]I would laugh my fucking ass off if the camel climbed out of here.
[414:40.34]Oh no guys, a cockroach died.
[414:52.49]Can somebody please... Predation is occurring?
[414:56.16]What does that mean?
[414:58.78]Whoa!
[415:00.24]Oh shit!
[415:01.82]What is he doing?
[415:06.80]He's... Figure it out!
[415:11.89]You have... It's not like covered in oil!
[415:14.47]Get up there!
[415:17.95]Oh, come on!
[415:26.60]Yo!
[415:57.52]Oh my god, please!
[416:01.05]Oh, fuck!
[416:01.81]Wait a minute, he had second thoughts?
[416:03.93]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[416:07.05]Somebody get out of here!
[416:08.91]Just jump!
[416:12.70]That person has like a... like a... a Christian?
[416:20.46]Like, is that... like a priest?
[416:23.20]Oh, no, no, no, that's the back of the sign.
[416:24.93]Okay.
[416:26.62]This is so fucked up over here.
[416:27.84]We need God!
[416:36.93]What happened there?
[416:40.37]No, there's no one's ever gonna get out of here.
[416:41.99]It's not gonna happen.
[416:43.83]It's over.
[416:48.06]Just wall off the ramp.
[416:49.16]If I do that, he turns into a box.
[417:01.76]Wait, what?
[417:02.78]Who got out?
[417:04.76]Who escaped?
[417:07.06]Who escaped?
[417:13.52]He didn't escape?
[417:19.04]It's never gonna happen.
[417:26.37]I'm so disappointed.
[417:29.97]I have one more.
[417:30.75]I got one more truck on my sleeve.
[418:22.47]I could have just done this from the beginning.
[418:26.34]Why did I spend so long?
[418:49.67]Where is everybody?
[418:51.19]Who took this huge shit?
[418:54.51]Are there any animals left in here?
[419:03.90]That's like... Oh, that's elephant.
[419:05.22]That's dinosaur type shit.
[419:06.48]Alright.
[419:10.26]Be free!
[419:10.74]Go!
[419:14.93]Is he gonna figure it out?
[419:21.53]He figured it out!
[419:22.07]He figured it out!
[419:22.53]He figured it out!
[419:24.43]The rabbit figured it out!
[419:32.88]Nobody else seems to care.
[419:34.14]It's just like a little rabbit.
[419:38.64]Where's the lion?
[419:42.73]Where's the lion?
[419:49.62]What happened to the lion?
[419:54.06]Fighting due to overcrowding.
[419:55.66]No shit.
[420:01.12]Wait, are these two fighting?
[420:03.70]They're gonna fight for it!
[420:18.42]He made it!
[420:19.50]No, no!
[420:23.49]What are you doing?
[420:24.03]Don't go back!
[420:26.97]Where are you going?
[420:27.77]I can't go.
[420:36.41]Alright, that's it!
[420:38.73]See ya.
[420:39.23]See ya tomorrow, guys.
[420:40.41]That's it.
[420:41.49]Stream over.
[420:57.28]Where are they?
[421:00.74]Look at all these cubs!
[421:04.01]This is cool.
[421:05.23]Don't worry, I got it saved.
[421:26.00]Look at all the janitors.
[421:44.03]Everyone is leaving.
[421:45.55]They're not even trying to do anything.
[421:46.93]Who died?
[422:00.82]They're still protesters.
[422:04.01]Oh, is it elephant?
[422:10.59]750.
[422:10.63]Here's the bottleneck right here.
[422:32.72]Holy shit.
[422:36.62]Imagine being this group.
[422:46.13]He's shitting through the door.
[422:48.17]Okay, I'm done.
[422:48.95]I'm out.
[422:49.37]I'm out.
[422:49.65]I'm out.
[422:49.87]It's game over.
[423:13.82]Wait, why is everybody locked away?
[423:18.34]I can't unbox anything.
[423:31.17]What is he doing?
[423:33.93]He's free!
[423:56.42]People are still coming into the park.
[424:03.00]Record attendance.
[424:07.21]Uh-oh, sniper!
[424:08.93]I don't think there's anybody left.
[424:18.66]Besides the bugs.
[424:25.99]No, the alligator.
[424:26.53]Wait.
[424:26.69]The bugs?
[424:34.46]See, the bugs are already free.
[424:45.16]Look at this shit.
[424:53.29]Look at all these snipers.
[425:02.40]I feel like this is a fucking arena shooter.
[425:16.90]Anything left?
[425:24.54]I think that's it.
[425:24.96]Oh, there's two elephants.
[425:32.43]Alright.
[425:33.39]Bye.
[425:33.57]See you next time.
[425:35.33]Wait a minute.
[425:40.43]Wait a minute.
[425:46.70]Wait a minute.
[426:11.28]No, I can't.
[426:11.56]I can't.
[426:13.48]I was going to see if I could build on there.
[426:15.30]Alright, that's it.
[426:21.50]That's the end of the zoo.
[426:28.29]Are there any animals left?
[426:29.83]Yeah, there we go.
[426:36.59]He's being so sneaky.
[426:39.71]He's like, I'm the only one that's left.
[426:46.23]The tortoise, where's the... Oh, the tortoise, right.
[426:48.77]Where's the tortoise?
[426:49.89]Peaceful.
[427:08.98]Peaceful.
[427:28.89]Big stretch.
[427:34.47]That was incredibly uncalled for.
[428:01.87]Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[428:03.61]That was, like, excessive.
[428:05.88]Incredibly excessive.
[428:13.64]Well, I had that saved, but tomorrow we're going to start Dead Rising.
[428:18.00]This game was fun.
[428:21.04]It was very interesting.
[428:25.10]I feel like there's enough to enjoy if you want to make, like, an elaborate place.
[428:29.72]Kind of like Planet Coaster, but
[428:33.72]There's a lot of weird shit you can do.
[428:38.88]So, Dead Rising will be tomorrow.
[428:41.68]I will see you guys then.
[428:42.88]Have a great one.
[428:46.85]My whole body hurts from laughing at some of the stuff in this game.
[428:50.51]I don't know why the gorilla climbing up and then climbing around the side is just... I was in actual pain.
[429:05.15]My god, okay.
[429:05.87]Alright.
[429:06.90]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[429:07.78]We'll uh, we'll do the bits and subs and everything But thanks for watching see you tomorrow for Dead Rising one Hey, look can we can we get some top bits is that gonna happen You know when you laugh so hard that you have you you you're forcing yourself to stop but it makes it worse
[429:31.11]Like, you triple laugh on top of what you're already laughing at.
[429:34.59]And then you just feel inside your chest, it just tightens and pain happens.
[429:40.89]So stupid.
[429:42.83]Hey, look at that!
[429:43.53]It still don't work.
[429:49.58]Just pretend that there's stuff there.
[429:54.00]Anyways, let's go through it.
[429:57.32]From earlier today.
[429:59.73]we had what did we have what did we have I need the music too what am I doing there it is so a while back a few hours well more like seven hours ago at this point we had cf cvfd thanks to the 2500 bits welcome back funny man how was the trip also a free dock
[430:30.80]Dr. Schmikeson was talking about.
[430:32.42]The trip was great.
[430:35.41]I got to meet up with a bunch of people that I haven't seen in a long time, so that was really good.
[430:41.21]I got back really, really, really late last night.
[430:43.45]Really, really early this morning, so I'm pretty tired.
[430:45.27]So I'll get some good sleep tonight.
[430:48.18]That's the plan, is to get some food and then just crash and wake up probably pretty early tomorrow, hopefully.
[430:56.66]And start Dead Rising.
[430:58.60]But thanks for the 2,500 bits, CVFD.
[431:00.86]I appreciate it.
[431:02.36]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[431:03.32]Hey, Jeremiah, how are you?
[431:05.04]I'm doing pretty good.
[431:06.92]Recently, I hosted my own Halloween stream with chat, and it was a success.
[431:11.05]I painted myself as a clown, and we watched a movie.
[431:14.09]That was the most fun I've ever had in a little while, and I can't wait to do that again.
[431:18.67]Hope you have a good stream tonight.
[431:22.33]Nobody does clown makeup stuff on stream.
[431:26.79]People are trying to, you know, I used to see people do, like, cosplay and stuff.
[431:29.79]But I want a faux, a real, actual faux clown.
[431:35.75]Except for you.
[431:38.30]Yeah, but I did it once.
[431:42.32]The Joker?
[431:43.32]No, the Joker's, that's, that's not a clown.
[431:45.68]The Joker doesn't make balloon animals.
[431:48.90]I think maybe in the, he doesn't, like, have, I mean, he's a, he's like a supervillain.
[431:55.44]He's not a birthday clown.
[431:58.19]Yes, he does.
[431:58.91]He doesn't.
[432:01.27]He probably put, like, weird gas in them one time and, like, popped them around Batman and Robin and, oh, no, here's the gas!
[432:07.03]The noxious fumes!
[432:08.76]He probably did that, like, in the 60s.
[432:18.06]He does this.
[432:18.98]Oh, well, I don't know.
[432:20.56]I'm wrong, then.
[432:21.10]But, yeah, thank you, PeacefulHaley.
[432:24.61]I'm glad you had a good stream.
[432:26.05]Halloween is always a fun time.
[432:28.43]However you can make it fun.
[432:31.79]In the cartoon, maybe he does this.
[432:33.23]I don't know.
[432:35.17]I have no idea what that means.
[432:35.95]I think that's a reference to the movie.
[432:37.79]I don't know.
[432:38.15]Thanks for the 1,500 bits, though.
[432:39.19]Appreciate it.
[432:40.23]15 bucks.
[432:57.32]Drink Big Gulp, thanks for the 500 bits.
[433:01.60]Sans, the Tenno, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[433:05.52]1,000 bits.
[433:08.60]Did you see?
[433:09.90]I saw the Sans entrance.
[433:11.61]I saw the Sans thing.
[433:14.07]I saw the fucking full Sans costume.
[433:17.49]It's ridiculous.
[433:23.25]It was a really damn good costume, too.
[433:28.56]I hope they do more shit like that, man.
[433:30.06]I don't know about you guys, but I really... I stopped watching wrestling when it went from fun, weird, interesting characters to first name, last name wrestler.
[433:43.55]I just lost interest.
[433:46.65]First name, last name in underwear.
[433:49.73]With spandex.
[433:51.91]It's just like, I don't care.
[433:52.91]This is not like, this is, it's not like, it's not like baseball.
[433:55.81]It was like the evil clown.
[434:05.93]He hates Stone Cold Steve Austin?
[434:07.63]No, no, no, because that was not Steve Austin.
[434:09.83]It was Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[434:14.73]That was Stone Cold.
[434:16.87]Steve Austin was just his name, but Stone Cold, he went by Stone Cold.
[434:27.90]And that's the bottom line.
[434:32.02]Hulk Hogan?
[434:34.82]That guy's name is not Hulk.
[434:39.15]It's... You think that Hulk Hogan's first name is the Hulk?
[434:47.21]That's like a made-up fucking name.
[434:52.16]Hulk Hogan's real name is like... Terry or something, isn't it?
[434:57.68]Let's see.
[434:58.00]What is it?
[435:04.10]Yeah, it's Terribalia.
[435:08.83]Come on, guys.
[435:10.53]But yeah, I did see it.
[435:11.61]I hope they do more stuff like that.
[435:12.61]That's really cool.
[435:14.44]Really fun.
[435:17.36]Hey, Fitty, thanks for the 500 bits.
[435:19.22]Uh, Dr. Schmoikson obviously knew the earlier questions for the he-knows-literally-everything joke.
[435:23.38]Uh, did he also know the answers to this question?
[435:25.78]Or did he actually get so close on accident?
[435:27.40]You're talking about... I'm gonna let the magic just stay.
[435:40.33]No behind scenes on that.
[435:41.39]We're just gonna let the magic play.
[435:46.86]UFO... kazoo... Sometimes you don't want to know what's behind the curtain.
[435:56.94]Somebody must have mouthed it.
[436:02.91]I was so happy that it was Dr. Spikes and back again.
[436:07.13]He had to come back and prove how smart he was and that he was a real doctor.
[436:20.89]I'm suspicious of Dr. Schmoikson's credentials.
[436:25.13]Why would you be?
[436:26.65]Who is he?
[436:27.29]That's Dr. Schmoikson.
[436:34.83]That's Dr. Arthur Schmoikson.
[436:37.76]I don't... What do you want me to tell you?
[436:39.16]But no, it was great.
[436:46.64]It was really good to have the doctor come back.
[436:51.65]No.
[436:51.81]It's too ingrained in my brain.
[436:53.07]To say stuff like, sick.
[436:53.78]Or, that's, oh, sick, nice.
[436:54.40]No, I say, that's fucking awesome.
[436:55.70]No, I don't say pug.
[436:56.30]I go...
[437:20.80]Dude, that's fucking awesome.
[437:23.14]I'll go, that's awesome.
[437:27.72]Sorry.
[437:28.86]I'm too old.
[437:32.24]Hey, Ampscoots, thanks for the 1500 bits donation box streamer.
[437:36.94]Yeah, I mean, there you go.
[437:38.08]Thank you.
[437:38.70]Appreciate that.
[437:39.28]I mean, like a couple weeks ago, I had the lion one out there.
[437:50.15]Dude, that fakes when you make more money on a stream than a lion exhibit.
[437:54.71]You know what I mean?
[437:56.59]I'm going like... Stop.
[438:08.74]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[438:14.00]You're not gonna tell me to stop.
[438:16.97]But no, thank you.
[438:17.57]Thank you, DarkSoul, for the $2.50.

[439:52.27]Let's see.
[439:54.85]What is this one?
[439:55.37]I got...
[440:07.59]I didn't even see that.
[440:14.15]He was like yelling at me.
[440:16.54]I got something to tell you.
[440:18.40]I got something to tell you.
[440:24.70]That's so funny.
[440:26.28]Alright, I'm going to show it.
[440:27.10]I'm going to show it.
[440:27.58]Hold on.
[440:32.78]That was so funny.
[440:34.44]Yeah, he went off on like a, I swear that this is things that I didn't know.
[440:39.16]He went off on like a full 25 second rant that we just don't have, I guess.
[440:43.36]I didn't see that part of this frame.
[440:47.57]That's so funny.
[440:50.91]Let's take a look.
[440:54.69]Is it going to play?
[440:59.91]We're going to go off and pass this off to BF Bugleberry.
[441:03.11]I got something to tell you guys.
[441:15.12]We're going to go off and pass this off to BF Bugleberry.
[441:18.32]That's so amazing.
[441:21.08]I love it so much.
[441:22.00]Yeah, I think they cut early.
[441:29.32]I'm so happy that happened.
[441:32.72]But, yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[441:34.78]Hope you guys enjoyed that stream.
[441:36.90]We try to do our best with having, like, two and a half weeks or two weeks or so of planning, so.
[441:43.20]The actual, the bot, the chat counting points bot broke.
[441:49.08]Immediately.
[441:49.82]And that's why I failed the first level of Plants vs. Zombies.
[441:54.64]I was sitting there getting fed into my ear that, like, the whole thing was broken.
[441:58.86]And I'm just going, oh, okay, so look at that.
[442:01.45]I'm just failing the Plants vs. Zombies tutorial while I'm, like, talking to the production people back there.
[442:11.75]But I had a lot of fun.
[442:14.77]It's always fun to do something like that.
[442:18.68]Impromptu.
[442:20.82]And it turned out pretty good, I thought.
[442:24.68]I had a fucking shitload of fun.
[442:26.76]Link, link, link, link, link, link, link, link.
[442:30.12]What about it?
[442:31.20]What is it?
[442:33.18]Let's see.
[442:35.92]What's this link?
[442:37.68]Oh, is this a diaper?
[442:40.63]Resident Shmoikson.
[442:45.39]That's pretty good.
[442:46.53]That's pretty good.
[442:47.23]But it would have to be shorter than that, though, because it would be Jerma Resident Shmoikson.
[443:00.94]There's some pretty good screencaps.
[443:10.58]One of these days, I'm telling you, one of these days, I'm going to just sit here and I'm going to add like 20 emotes.
[443:17.84]It's going to happen.
[443:19.26]And I'm not even going to tell you when they're going to appear.
[443:21.99]They're just going to be there one day.
[443:24.91]Like, you're going to just turn the stream on and you're going to look at your thing and there's going to be like 30 fucking new emotes.
[443:32.01]It's just going to happen.
[443:32.73]I'm going to take like two days off.
[443:35.73]And just do all the stuff that I wanted to do for the stream.
[443:38.52]All the new music.
[443:39.34]All the new art.
[443:40.28]Just make like 40 emotes.
[443:43.46]And just load them all up.
[443:49.08]No, not tomorrow.
[443:49.81]That's not what I said.
[443:52.37]But thank you to we were back here.
[443:55.09]Where were we?
[443:56.81]I got lost there.
[443:59.52]Oh, and the music turned off, too.
[444:00.92]What the fuck?
[444:02.58]Okay.
[444:04.63]We were at... Right here.
[444:08.57]Thank you, Gnarly, for the $2.50.
[444:09.77]Hey, Jerma, thanks for choosing a game for me a couple weeks ago.
[444:12.07]It was Earthbound over Luigi's Mansion.
[444:15.01]Now I want to play more classic RPG games.
[444:17.04]I already have Super Mario RPG on my list.
[444:19.28]Anything else I should add?
[444:20.28]Chrono Trigger.
[444:22.16]In fact, play Chrono Trigger twice in a row.
[444:25.36]Just do it.
[444:27.46]Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross.
[444:32.52]Okay.
[444:34.70]No.
[444:36.00]Play Chrono Trigger and then, like, record it and then play it backwards.
[444:39.10]Music's too loud?
[444:44.76]I'll change that.
[444:45.64]I'll fix that shit.
[444:47.60]Thank you for that.
[444:51.41]Uh, yeah.
[444:51.77]Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger are the two of my favorite turn-based RPGs I've ever played.
[444:58.61]Hope you enjoy them.
[445:00.03]Cold Rush, thanks for the 900 bits.
[445:01.51]Love you, Jeremy.
[445:02.25]Thank you, Cold Rush.
[445:04.29]Appreciate that.
[445:05.75]Thank you.
[445:07.17]Bone Jackal, thanks for the 500 bits.
[445:09.04]Yo, this guy in a white van outside my house says he's giving away tons of free leftover Halloween candy.
[445:17.42]I would not get in.
[445:19.04]I would tell that person to leave and I would probably call the police.
[445:27.12]And just let them know.
[445:33.17]though thank you Bob boy it's Bob boy Bob boy with the 500 bits last of the bits for the week tf tubers thanks a lot Bob boy appreciate the five bucks appreciate it thank you then we had a shitload of community subs people were just dumping them in five ten five five five five five
[446:02.17]Thanks a lot.
[446:02.91]There was a string there of about 40 or 50 in a row.
[446:05.43]Thanks, guys.
[446:05.97]Seriously.
[446:09.15]Even more, we had Shady Seas dropped 20 during that whole thing.
[446:14.81]Abomination 0, thanks for the 250.
[446:16.29]I dropped my cookie and my milk.
[446:17.69]It's alright, leave it there.
[446:20.15]Leave it there, let it sit at the bottom.
[446:21.81]Let it turn to milk cookie dust.
[446:24.76]And then you drink it at the very end.
[446:26.94]Leave it there, don't take it out, are you crazy?
[446:33.35]No, that's how you do it.
[446:34.13]If you drop... No, no, no, no, listen to me.
[446:37.41]If you drop a cookie in your milk, and it goes down and sinks to the bottom, if you... Are you gonna reach in there with all your hand oils and the hair that's on your hands?
[446:46.84]Are you gonna get a fork and dig it out with a fork?
[446:51.12]No, your hand oils, don't do that.
[447:00.94]What if I drop it in my soup?
[447:02.36]Well, then you're eating dessert and dinner at the same time.
[447:06.40]Which, that's pretty cool.
[447:08.64]I wouldn't be, I would not be embarrassed about that at all.
[447:13.42]Uh, thank you, PlankV2 gave 3,700 bits.
[447:14.84]Just about 4,000 bits from PlankV2.
[447:26.58]Thank you, Plank.
[447:27.00]Hope you liked it.
[447:27.40]No fun fact, but you don't have to have any fun facts if you don't want to.
[447:29.58]Thank you so much, though.
[447:57.76]And also, happy birthday.
[448:04.90]That was a fun fact.
[448:09.74]No, but happy birthday.
[448:11.34]Thanks for the 3,700 bits.
[448:13.80]Really appreciate that.
[448:15.55]MrKoolAid dropped 20 community subs right when we turned off, I think.
[448:22.11]Back-to-back 10 sub drops.
[448:26.70]We're gonna have an entire chat of subbed people.
[448:32.86]Thank you, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[448:33.66]Seriously.
[448:35.78]Why don't we show them on screen?
[448:37.44]Let's do it.
[448:39.14]Credits time.
[448:41.94]Let's see.
[448:44.52]Oh, boy.
[448:45.87]Oh, that was... Oh, boy.
[448:48.87]That's a lot.
[448:49.57]That's a lot.
[448:55.97]Thank you, all of you.
[448:56.89]For all your subs, all the community subs, everybody.
[448:59.15]You still... Push this stream to new monetary heights.
[449:04.44]Somehow.
[449:06.16]All I can say is thank you.
[449:12.05]Reaper, thanks for the $2.50.
[449:15.48]Hey, Jerma, just want to say thanks for all the laughs.
[449:16.88]I recently got a new job.
[449:17.72]After losing a position I was certain I was getting, a year gone, but I now have a concrete job now.
[449:23.42]That's good.
[449:24.92]You kept me laughing all this time, and now I can send some love back.
[449:27.52]Expect more bits from me in the future.
[449:29.32]Much love.
[449:32.41]Glad you got a solid job.
[449:37.07]Take care of yourself first.
[449:40.13]put me under, like, fast food McChicken run.
[449:44.12]You know what I'm saying?
[449:46.72]I appreciate it, though.
[449:47.38]Thank you, seriously.
[449:53.13]Uh, glad you got a job.
[449:57.19]That's pretty low?
[450:00.09]No, it's not.
[450:03.33]That's higher than pack of gum.
[450:04.55]Right?
[450:06.28]Right?
[450:13.50]That's higher than water at the airport.
[450:17.22]Things you just wouldn't do.
[450:21.82]I think that's pretty high.
[450:28.35]Watching you is like eating fast food.
[450:30.05]Bad for me, but good for me.
[450:34.61]Well, thank you, though.
[450:35.17]I appreciate it.
[450:37.56]But thank you, Reaper.
[450:38.26]Thank you, Vilemi, for the 300 bits.
[450:40.00]StreamClown complains that there's not enough clowns on Twitch.
[450:45.12]I didn't complain.
[450:52.73]I just said I would love to see more clowns on Twitch.
[450:55.37]But I wouldn't though.
[450:56.11]That's bullshit.
[450:57.81]I'm just making this up.
[451:02.07]I don't want to see that.
[451:03.59]I don't care.
[451:05.41]I'm like faux caring about that.
[451:07.50]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[451:10.38]I just am.
[451:10.70]Whatever.
[451:11.08]Whatever.
[451:12.71]Thank you, James, for the 500 bits.
[451:13.65]Hey, remember the Halloween stream was awesome and I loved every second of it.
[451:16.63]Maybe not the slime action part.
[451:19.55]Was it because I was wearing a diaper?
[451:20.79]I apologize personally to you.
[451:24.40]Well, anyways, I kind of recently started working in a lush bath bomb factory.
[451:28.84]Really?
[451:34.13]That's really fucking cool, actually.
[451:36.55]Remember that bath bomb that turned you into a Simpsons character?
[451:39.75]Well, was it lush?
[451:43.74]I wish I could send you some and make you other cartoon characters.
[451:47.14]Tell Shannon, Sharon, she's a good host.
[451:50.00]She was.
[451:51.94]And tell, uh, I mean, Dr. Schmoytson.
[451:57.09]What?
[451:57.23]I'm gonna tell Dr. Schmoytson that you said hi.
[452:01.53]Okay, bye, they said.
[452:05.17]Uh, that has... I'm thinking of jobs that would be, like, interesting things to do.
[452:11.04]Making the bath bombs for Lush is... kind of sounds like fun to do.
[452:16.48]Is it?
[452:17.20]You'll have to inform us.
[452:22.17]Apple Shift, thanks for the $2.50.
[452:22.89]Heyo, what's been the greatest day of your life ever so far?
[452:27.11]Hmm.
[452:29.05]Um... That's tough.
[452:32.77]Greatest day of my life ever...
[452:36.24]I don't know.
[452:43.86]I don't... I can't answer that.
[452:45.65]There's been too many things that could have been that.
[452:52.25]You know what?
[452:52.65]Probably...
[452:54.37]Probably when I got the message from, and now this company like sucks, okay?
[453:00.59]I know.
[453:01.83]But when I like got my, you are partnered from Machinima message like eight years ago, that was like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing, this is the greatest day of my life.
[453:13.20]I was like, wow, this is fucking awesome.
[453:18.18]And I was like, that was like pretty cool.
[453:20.72]That was a big deal.
[453:27.87]What a shitty life.
[453:30.07]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[453:31.31]You gotta remember, I'm talking about like eight and a half years ago.
[453:37.83]Guys, like the YouTube ad program and making money on ads on YouTube, that like started just barely like seven and a half, eight and a half years ago.
[453:48.60]It never used to be like that.
[453:52.73]So essentially I was being told, Hey, uh, the views on your, on your videos are now going to make money.
[453:58.28]And it was the first time it had ever been a thing.
[454:00.61]So it was like, what the fuck are you serious?
[454:06.44]And then that company made a series of some of the worst business decisions you probably could ever make in your whole life.
[454:11.96]And they went through like four CEOs.
[454:14.14]And it turns out one of the CEOs, I think, went to jail.
[454:16.68]And the whole company got liquidated.
[454:19.14]So, okay.
[454:22.02]Turn the clock forward 10 years.
[454:32.18]Happy ending.
[454:41.52]But that was a different time period on YouTube.
[454:46.12]It really was just... Nobody knew anything.
[454:49.73]Nobody knew what the hell they were doing.
[454:52.91]There was no formula.
[454:54.55]It was just... You just did whatever.
[454:55.87]But...
[455:04.85]The golden age of YouTube.
[455:06.57]I don't know if I would call that the golden age of YouTube.
[455:08.77]I would call probably... You know what?
[455:10.61]Here.
[455:11.27]Stamp this.
[455:12.43]I would say, like, 2013.
[455:14.73]Like, 2012 to, like... No, 2013 to, like, 2015.
[455:17.79]That, like, two-year span of, like, two or three years was, I think, the best, uh, the most fun I ever had on YouTube.
[455:26.30]Between, like, 2012 and, like, 2014, 2015.
[455:36.01]A two-year span of two to three years.
[455:37.47]Yeah, that's it.
[455:38.10]Exactly.
[455:43.32]Yeah, 2013 especially.
[455:44.70]I think it was... I was having the most fun ever.
[455:48.76]You talk about, oh, what's like the greatest day ever?
[455:51.22]I don't know, when... when Castle Griffinstein got uploaded?
[455:54.01]That was just... I just loved every second of what I was doing.
[455:59.33]I'm serious.
[456:05.66]But we could reminisce.
[456:07.88]All day.
[456:14.69]Jerma Rumble Live, too, but that was also... That was kind of at the tail end, though.
[456:22.63]and then they made all kinds of ad friendly decisions and changing the way the site works and what constitutes a view and what constitutes engagement and then what happened is he started having people just feed into engagement and it wasn't about getting clicks anymore it was about making people stay and watch and watch a bunch of ads and mid-rolls and then I was it was kind of like I don't I'm kind of done
[456:58.12]He hates YouTube.
[457:00.48]No, that's not true.
[457:03.89]It just... Things changed a little.
[457:08.49]And I was kind of just over it.
[457:11.17]So here we are now.
[457:14.09]But!
[457:15.21]We only have a few more left to do.
[457:17.79]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the $2.50.
[457:18.87]I linked this video once, but I don't remember when.
[457:21.53]And you had a really funny reaction, so I hope to recreate that now.
[457:25.48]Also, streaming Planet Zoo was my wish for today.
[457:28.14]There you go.
[457:30.18]I told the pre-chat to tell you to play it if it wasn't there, so I'm glad this happened.
[457:34.03]It was a fun stream.
[457:34.71]Also, congrats on the Halloween stream!
[457:36.57]It was incredibly fun.
[457:37.69]The way you're using this platform to be innovative is seriously awesome.
[457:40.45]See you next stream.
[457:42.97]I'm gonna try.
[457:45.19]I can't say that everything I'm gonna do is gonna be perfect, but I'd like to continue to try things that I think are different or interesting or fun for me or
[457:55.42]We'll keep doing it.
[457:57.37]Would you go to Mixer if they paid you a ton of money?
[457:59.27]No.
[458:01.55]I don't want to change platforms again.
[458:03.01]I'm not going to do that again.
[458:05.67]Alright, did it once.
[458:07.89]I went from YouTube to Twitch.
[458:09.55]I'm not going from Twitch to Mixer.
[458:11.07]If I started on Twitch, maybe I would move to Mixer.
[458:15.45]Maybe, maybe, if that was the only time I'd moved.
[458:19.28]But I took an established audience on YouTube and said, alright, go here now.
[458:25.02]And it took a while for, you know, that whole thing to play out and for years to go by.
[458:29.50]Alright, well, let's do it again.
[458:31.28]I'm moving another mixer this time.
[458:32.98]And everybody has to move again.
[458:34.48]And people will just be like, I don't want to.
[458:38.75]No, I don't think.
[458:40.39]And I'm not one of those people that would be brought to Mixer.
[458:44.93]I don't.
[458:45.35]I'm not.
[458:46.45]I wouldn't consider myself one of those people that we've reached out to.
[458:54.76]You already lost a lot of people.
[458:55.75]I still have people saying, oh, he's streaming.
[458:57.47]I'll check him out.
[458:59.03]Yeah, I just don't want to have to bounce around to platforms.
[459:04.05]I'm just here.
[459:07.06]I'm just here and I'm going to be here.
[459:09.86]Okay, no, yeah, sure.
[459:10.88]Okay.
[459:11.76]If I got offered like a million... No, if I got offered like... Oh, that's a lot of money.
[459:22.33]That's a lot of fucking money.
[459:23.55]That's a lot of money.
[459:24.73]Let me just... Do you guys understand how much money that is?
[459:27.64]If somebody offered me a million dollars... I would have... I would seriously have to consider what that was.
[459:34.84]Twitch is gonna hear you.
[459:47.03]I mean, you're talking about...
[459:50.01]Okay, if it was like $50,000, I'd be like, get the fuck out of here.
[459:55.73]No.
[459:55.79]If it was like $100,000, I'd be like, get out of here, you bastard.
[459:58.86]Okay, $150,000 to $200,000, I would be like, you're not going to get me over there.
[460:01.60]Is there any other offer?
[460:17.89]$500,000 is like... He's naming his price.
[460:32.80]I mean, you're talking about, like, just immediate, complete, like, life-changing money.
[460:39.05]Like, immediate.
[460:40.39]It's not like, oh, we're going to give you $250,000 over the course of 40 years.
[460:45.83]No, no, you're talking about, here's $500,000.
[460:47.67]It's like, okay, you just, like, solidified my whole retirement plan.
[461:00.26]But plus taxes.
[461:01.12]Yeah.
[461:04.30]$10 million to partner with Magnavox for VHS content only.
[461:07.51]Yeah, sure.
[461:09.15]That'd be the stupidest fucking thing ever, but I would make $10 million, and there'd be VHS streams, it'd be hilarious for like a year, and then I would quit.
[461:20.05]But no, it would have to be a stupid amount of money for me to even consider it.
[461:25.05]I don't care.
[461:26.79]I really don't.
[461:27.33]Like, I'm not, like... Look at all these other platforms that exist!
[461:30.63]Whatever.
[461:32.83]There's already so many people here and I get such a huge monetary support on this platform.
[461:41.09]Why would I do that?
[461:42.01]There's like no reason to.
[461:49.65]He hates money.
[461:52.63]He's too rich to care.
[461:54.03]No, no, I'm just saying like there's already, I already, I'm doing just fine here.
[462:03.60]You know what I'm saying.
[462:10.17]Golden throne.
[462:11.97]Well, make it out of, like, granite.
[462:15.49]It's like a rock throne.
[462:17.23]Rock can be pretty damn expensive.
[462:18.39]But it's big.
[462:20.22]It's a big granite throne.
[462:21.64]You know what I'm saying?
[462:26.38]It's big.
[462:27.38]Watch the clip.
[462:28.32]What is this?
[462:29.46]You guys keep spamming this damn thing.
[462:35.25]I don't even care.
[462:50.58]I'm talking about the game.
[462:52.38]I was trying to put the monitor on the educational board.
[463:00.06]Come on, that's bullshit.
[463:05.35]and you all know that but no yeah money is nice right to end that story and then that rant and then that kind of piece I'm not going to move to another platform that's what I mean hey they're gonna hey uh we want to give you five hundred thousand dollars to move here hey uh hey current platform
[463:33.67]I just wanted to ask you a quick question about how things are working here.
[463:36.93]And just if you're curious, the number was around half a mil.
[463:40.57]And that's what I was offered.
[463:41.93]And I wonder if you would anything you'd like to do to maybe increase that and keep me around.
[463:51.78]And then you get that number.
[463:53.74]Hey, dear other platform.
[463:55.44]Yeah, it's me.
[463:56.22]Yeah, I considered your first offer.
[463:58.20]Unfortunately, I was just offered from my current platform, um, 600.
[464:02.52]And, you know, I think I'm gonna have to stay.
[464:05.90]I mean, that's a lot, and I don't really care that much.
[464:09.00]Unless, you know, there was anything you wanted.
[464:12.48]Hit me up.
[464:12.92]You got my number.
[464:14.68]And then you take that over.
[464:16.86]Back to the current platform.
[464:18.02]Well, you know, I got, let me tell you something.
[464:19.72]I'm really, really loyal.
[464:21.80]And then bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[464:23.48]Eventually you get that number to like 1.2 million.
[464:27.73]And then you go too high and you go too far that you overbid and both of them just leave.
[464:33.93]So, and then you just have nothing.
[464:35.47]You just keep going back and forth until you just lose it all.
[464:45.58]That's like continuing to bet.
[464:48.42]That's like the roulette table.
[464:51.18]Just keep putting down $100 and if you just keep winning over and over again and keep doubling your bet.
[464:58.67]I put down $1,000 on red.
[464:59.25]You won.
[464:59.65]Put $2,000 on red.
[465:00.73]You won.
[465:01.51]Put $4,000 on red.
[465:01.99]You won.
[465:02.31]Put $8,000 on red.
[465:02.97]You lost.
[465:03.23]Oh.
[465:03.29]Oh well.
[465:15.03]Can I have that back?
[465:17.11]No, you can't.
[465:18.23]Oh.
[465:18.75]Bye.
[465:18.83]Vroom.
[465:18.99]$8,000 pocket change for Jerma.
[465:37.33]That's not true.
[465:46.57]It's pocket change.
[465:52.76]He's in his Ferrari.
[465:54.44]I would never buy an expensive car.
[465:58.88]I'm of the opinion that if you buy and you have a, like, I'm talking like a fucking $100,000 to $200,000 car.
[466:04.98]You're just yelling out your windows and blaring speakers that say, I have a shitload of money.
[466:11.58]I have way more money than everybody around me.
[466:15.49]What do you think about that?
[466:17.41]Yeah, I probably have $500 in the glove box in cash.
[466:22.37]I don't know.
[466:22.93]Probably there.
[466:23.61]I don't want to do that.
[466:37.86]And plus, look, cars, people like that really like cars.
[466:41.88]I get it.
[466:42.35]I do.
[466:44.53]It's a whole world with different cars and engines and mechanical stuff.
[466:51.23]I know people love that shit.
[466:54.29]But I'll just drive around in like a Camry.
[466:57.61]I don't care.
[466:59.85]If I had $50 million, I would drive like a 2014 Camry.
[467:07.73]And then I would just hold the megaphone out the window and say, I have more money than all of you.
[467:12.35]You idiots, I have $1,000 in the gun box.
[467:14.77]You can do that other ways.
[467:15.57]You don't have to do that with just a car.
[467:16.97]But anyways.
[467:32.92]How much of the donations get used on the strip?
[467:36.06]Not very much.
[467:38.89]Maybe like 40% of my income.
[467:41.57]No, I'm not even going to keep, I'm not even going to like, that's fucking ridiculous.
[467:45.41]I'm not even going to say that because it's like so easy for people to be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[467:49.92]It's not even real.
[467:50.86]It's ridiculous.
[467:52.08]It's a joke.
[467:56.96]Anyways, we have yeses online.
[467:59.05]Thanks to 250 already gave money this stream, but here's a necessary link.
[468:04.56]Also, I'm going to go into Vegas for Thanksgiving, so I need good food recommendations if you can.
[468:08.95]John Wick out.
[468:11.25]Hash House a go-go.
[468:12.89]Done.
[468:14.27]Just eat every meal there.
[468:15.25]That's the link.
[468:17.47]What is this?
[468:17.79]BuzzFeed.
[468:21.46]Pick a slang word and we'll tell you what boomer you are?
[468:24.66]What is this?
[468:29.84]What's the highest single bet you've ever put on a table?
[468:34.06]Was it $100 or $500?
[468:36.60]See, this is like an interesting bait to try to be like, oh, it was like $100.
[468:41.63]And then, wow, holy shit, you're fucking insane, right?
[468:45.05]I understand the game you're playing.
[468:51.49]Much more than that, though.
[468:58.68]And I won.
[469:00.58]All 15 times in a row that I did it.
[469:06.20]And I just was like driving like around and just like throwing the cash around.
[469:13.78]I'm in the parking lot just like dropping it.
[469:21.53]In his Ferrari.
[469:23.17]In my Ferrari.
[469:26.61]Alright, what am I doing here?
[469:33.16]No, I don't carry cash.
[469:36.71]I really don't.
[469:37.31]I don't care.
[469:38.07]I never have more than, like, a $10 bill on me at all times, ever.
[469:40.53]Because, you know, you lose your wallet.
[469:45.18]What if you had, like, $500 in your wallet?
[469:49.10]You, like, lost it or something.
[469:50.36]Like, there goes $500.
[469:51.80]No, I never carry cash.
[469:54.01]Alright, what boomer am I?
[469:55.75]I just clicked it.

[470:10.40]Dudes?
[470:11.40]Fam or squad?
[470:12.54]Well, I do not say fam or squad.
[470:14.34]Absolutely not.
[470:15.96]Uh, I do not say y'all.
[470:17.08]I don't say a gathering.
[470:18.20]I say dudes.
[470:18.74]This is like your, like, people, I don't know.
[470:21.22]Pick a pet name for your significant other.

[470:44.68]Nope.
[470:45.19]Okay.
[470:50.85]Not real, no opinion, needs to be taken seriously, or who cares?
[470:56.05]Okay.
[470:56.19]Okay.
[471:00.97]He threw in the climate change.
[471:05.59]No, we're going to fucking burn our goddamn planet to the ground.
[471:09.25]Yeah, alright.
[471:10.23]Climate change, yes.
[471:13.69]What do you call food?
[471:16.23]Grub chow food a meal.
[471:18.79]That's called food.
[471:20.90]How do you write?
[471:21.70]This is how.
[471:22.32]This, this, this.
[471:23.38]Lowercase.
[471:25.84]I'm 10% boomer.
[471:31.15]you go guys there you go took your test I mean that is I mean that well that's from buzzfeed so it's 10 reliable
[472:05.74]10%.
[472:13.82]Everyone at BuzzFeed is a boomer?
[472:16.25]I don't think that's true.
[472:22.65]How many articles do they write on BuzzFeed a day?
[472:24.27]Like 30?
[472:24.43]40?
[472:24.55]It's something like that.
[472:28.90]So that's 10% of all articles written today.
[472:40.13]I also got 10%, it's rigged.
[472:45.19]Is it- can you get more than 10% or is it just a way to just diarrhea out an article?
[472:54.51]By the way, what the hell did I just do?
[472:59.11]Why does that exist?
[473:00.88]That was like six random, like, questions.
[473:05.38]What even was that?
[473:06.46]Why was that an article?
[473:18.20]Yeah, you just sold your information away.
[473:20.14]No, that's not true.
[473:27.37]I guess I am 100% boomer because I just took the quiz.
[473:30.75]That's the real test, guys.
[473:32.09]Actually taking that quiz means you're a boomer.
[473:35.17]Right?
[473:37.11]I actually clicked on the squares.
[473:42.99]Anyways, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[473:44.47]Whoa, hold on a minute.
[473:45.21]We got a Jerma's Pet Ferret.
[473:47.56]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[473:49.92]Jerma, I work in a vet clinic and today I turned on your stream for the dogs in the kennels to listen to.
[473:54.34]And I must say the usually noisy crowd was pacified by your voice.
[473:57.90]Really?
[473:59.18]You always start streams while I'm at work, but thank the gods for VODs.
[474:02.17]Much love.
[474:03.69]Hell yeah.
[474:07.87]Jerma's Pet Ferret.
[474:10.85]Thank you.
[474:12.13]Thank you.
[474:14.72]Super Tentorium, thanks for the 300 bits.
[474:16.76]Jeremy, any chance we could see some kind of charity stream?
[474:19.84]With the success of the carnival and Halloween streams, I truly think we could make something big happen.
[474:23.69]Yes, there actually is a plan to do one already.
[474:28.45]I'm going to be working with one of my buddies who will be running the marathon.
[474:35.01]we're going to try to we're probably going to sell a shirt and just the shirt is just any money that comes in the shirt is to sponsor his run and to uh go to the charity that all the money goes to charity so there will be there's going to be just a there'll be a charity t-shirt probably soon here
[475:01.47]So it's interesting that you said that because we literally just talked about it like four or five, three or four days ago.
[475:09.81]What's the schedule this week?
[475:12.25]I have a doctor's appointment on Thursday.
[475:14.73]So I will not be around on Thursday.
[475:16.17]But we're going to go tomorrow, Dead Rising.
[475:17.79]And then I have a doctor's appointment on Thursday.
[475:20.53]And I'm going to do Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[475:23.87]I'm going to assume Friday will be Dead Rising.
[475:27.71]Maybe I'll need to do another stream after that.
[475:30.72]We'll see.
[475:37.30]Outer Worlds.
[475:38.62]That's right.
[475:39.22]I do have to play Outer Worlds as well.
[475:42.04]Outer Worlds, I'm going to tell you.
[475:45.30]I'm probably not going to finish Outer Worlds on stream.
[475:51.31]We'll probably do a Red Dead scenario where I do it a couple of streams.
[475:54.93]Maybe two or three.
[475:58.43]And then I'm going to finish it off stream.
[476:03.12]It's not that long.
[476:04.06]I know, I know.
[476:04.72]But still, it is though, isn't it?
[476:08.12]not a long wait how is it not it's not long that game sucks so nothing of value is lost it's 45 out yeah but that's still a lot 30 to 40 hours is still that's about at least four streams I don't do like 10 hour streams we'll see we'll see but we'll do that after Dead Rising
[476:39.32]and then that's no we know we got more we got more we got more unkind thanks for the 500 bits hey Jerma I'm just chilling after an eventful couple weeks and no it'll cheer me up to hear you speak to me directly let's go unkind what's going on they say keep up with the creative and awesome really enjoy the Halloween stream here's to many more I hope so there are at least a few already being planned right now
[477:06.09]I'm going to get back in front of the green screen.
[477:07.59]That'll be one of them.
[477:08.33]We'll do a whole night of it.
[477:10.84]That'll be probably happening somewhere in probably one of the last weeks of November.
[477:21.08]Yeah.
[477:21.30]Because I want to give you guys like a week or two to come up with things for me to do.
[477:31.25]Jeremy used to be so handsome.
[477:36.91]I can't ban you through Streamlabs.
[477:39.41]But I tried to.
[477:41.08]That's all that matters.
[477:43.62]But yeah, thank you, Unkind.
[477:44.40]I really appreciate that.
[477:45.18]Thanks for the $5.
[477:46.82]And stay tuned.

[478:10.05]Uh... Tips on dealing with a boomer.
[478:13.59]Well... Try to come to an agreement.
[478:19.99]Try to give your perspective.
[478:23.24]Listen to their perspective.
[478:25.74]And then immediately tell them.
[478:27.96]Immediately point at them.
[478:29.62]And say wrong, incorrect... Stupid...
