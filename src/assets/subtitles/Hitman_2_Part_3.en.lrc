[00:03.44]Hey, let's change the game to Hitman.
[00:07.45]This is worse than Quiet Man.
[00:11.51]Hitman.
[00:14.05]Just for fun!
[00:15.91]What is- everything's just for fun.
[00:18.97]Go back to Quiet- I'm sorry, but you've- we've made the lasagna, I made it for the whole company, you have to eat this.
[00:26.53]Like, that's like I did a poll in my company.
[00:29.13]Up in the chair.
[00:30.25]What do you guys want for lunch tomorrow?
[00:32.53]And 60% of the people vote for lasagna.
[00:35.95]And then all of a sudden, a truck pulls up and a fucking kiddie pool lasagna comes over here.
[00:42.27]And nobody eats it.
[00:43.17]Maybe two people take, like, as if you go to a birthday party and somebody eats one slice of the gross cake that nobody wants.
[00:48.60]No, no, no, that's not happening.
[00:49.68]That's not happening in my company.
[00:50.58]You're eating this lasagna.
[00:51.92]Because you voted for it.
[00:57.68]51%.
[00:57.70]Well, 51... There better be half lasagna.
[01:03.43]What am I gonna do with this lawless lasagna?
[01:05.45]What am I supposed to do with lasagna?
[01:08.21]Everybody likes lasagna.
[01:09.35]You'll eat it, right?
[01:10.43]Like, you'll eat this.
[01:13.53]I didn't even change... Hitman.
[01:18.95]Hitman... I don't know.
[01:21.32]It'd take me an hour to make a title.
[01:25.06]Um...
[01:28.82]Look at chat.
[01:29.44]I'm looking at chat.
[01:30.94]What if you're allergic to lasagna?
[01:32.94]Well, they'd be a gluten-free fridge with a bunch of stuff in it.
[01:45.63]Hitman lasagna.
[01:47.57]Hitman lasagna.
[01:48.53]How do you spell lasagna?
[01:53.42]I'm just going to spell it phonetically.
[01:55.45]La... Zahn... Yeah.
[02:00.41]Lasagna.
[02:06.14]It's going to be called Hitman Company Lasagna.
[02:11.27]There.
[02:17.37]By the way, I mean, we're not stopping right now.
[02:20.17]I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[02:21.92]Tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow because it is Thanksgiving.
[02:25.66]Happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.
[02:28.70]We're not stopping.
[02:29.32]Don't worry.
[02:29.68]We're not stopping.
[02:36.34]Alright.
[02:36.69]Let's eat some fucking lasagna.
[02:40.99]Wait, why am I using the controller?
[02:42.47]I was keyboard and mouse last time.
[02:46.26]Ah, he's doing the end of the stream voice.
[02:47.78]Okay.
[02:49.44]So, uh, okay.
[02:52.13]But, uh, I think... Right, that's how it is.
[02:56.27]Okay, so.
[02:58.07]I think, uh... Mm-mm.
[03:06.21]I just got angry.
[03:07.01]I just got fucking angry looking at this.
[03:10.25]I have to get it off the screen.
[03:13.91]Alright, let's see.
[03:14.95]What do we want to try?
[03:20.97]Let's go back here.
[03:22.77]And let's try a different scenario.
[03:26.51]Planning.
[03:30.63]I'm not playing ghost mode.
[03:32.41]Absolutely not.
[03:35.05]Lower the suit.
[03:36.93]Alright, event.
[03:37.46]Let's try... We can go here.
[03:42.98]We can take... Obviously, I'm taking a fish.
[03:48.55]Everyone would scream at me if I didn't.
[03:52.89]Alright, stream was good.
[03:53.97]See y'all later.
[03:54.63]DM me if Quiet Man comes back.
[04:02.08]Just take a piece of lasagna to go.
[04:05.12]Don't just leave it.
[04:06.32]I mean, I know...
[04:11.56]I'm losing half of my viewer base here.
[04:16.16]Because I made everybody eat lasagna.
[04:18.50]Okay, well, what if it was lasagna?
[04:19.59]What if half of the lasagna was, like, veggie lasagna, and half was, uh, like, a meat-based lasagna?
[04:26.05]It was cut in half.
[04:26.65]It was a giant pizza.
[04:27.95]Would you eat it then?
[04:39.51]Split the screen.
[04:40.90]But I can't play it like that.
[04:54.49]People are leaving because you keep making the lasagna.
[04:56.91]Well, that's a very, very strong reference, I think.
[05:10.40]Alright, well, stop blending in.
[05:13.96]So we have... Look, are you going to stay now?
[05:20.83]I'm about to throw a briefcase at somebody.
[05:22.35]Isn't that extraordinarily hilarious?
[05:30.08]I'm leaving.
[05:31.88]Sorry.
[05:33.86]Why am I sorry?
[05:36.66]Alright.
[05:37.54]So we got...
[05:40.12]Mission Stories.
[05:41.54]A Perfect Machine.
[05:43.36]Intravenous.
[05:44.72]We did this one.
[05:49.23]The Munchies.
[05:51.27]The New Army.
[05:53.17]The Triumph.
[05:54.55]Turbocharged.
[05:55.53]I mean, this one is so strange, I kind of want to know what it is.
[06:03.83]The New Army.
[06:07.51]So that's pretty far away.
[06:08.43]Can I get in the boat?
[06:08.97]Can I drive the boat?
[06:13.21]I don't think I can.
[06:13.75]That'd be amazing.
[06:16.55]Turn off the sound.
[06:19.85]What, you want the Quiet Man experience?
[06:33.22]Alright, here we go.
[06:35.42]I'm not gonna turn off the sound.
[06:36.62]People are probably gonna come here and be like, oh, Hitman 2, okay!
[06:47.76]loud man no I'm not I'm not doing a cheese grater to my feet I'm not turning the sound off I'm not putting a cheese grater on my feet and I'm not going to turn the sound as loud as I I'm going to do the hitman mission
[07:11.84]That is Ted Mendez, one of the country's most influential military-grade money men.
[07:17.72]This must be connected to Kronstadt.
[07:21.51]Okay.
[07:23.29]Let's see if we can listen to what this guy says.
[07:24.99]Look, dolphins?
[07:36.05]Phil, it's Ted here.
[07:37.59]Just returning your call before heading over to the expo building to meet Knox for the new combat android presentation.
[07:43.75]Combat android presentation.
[07:45.51]OK.
[07:45.63]Yeah, the stutter is kind of crazy.
[07:48.98]Why?
[07:49.76]It's because there's water.
[07:53.24]Last time I tried to have a meeting with him, he had me sitting in a room for four hours before canceling.
[08:00.42]I don't have a 780, I have a 1080.
[08:04.03]My drivers might be from like 2016, but it's still a 1080, goddammit.
[08:09.11]I'm kidding, that's a joke.
[08:10.07]I have the drivers.
[08:10.55]Okay.
[08:10.83]Update drivers.
[08:29.14]Disguise yourself as Ted Mendez.
[08:31.48]You got it.
[08:35.13]Hey.
[08:40.97]My 970 runs again.
[08:41.55]Do I need to get drivers?
[08:45.65]Maybe I should update my drivers on stream.
[08:47.24]Is this guy going to see this?
[09:03.00]Uh, anybody there?
[09:06.99]You need to show yourself.
[09:08.37]Whoever you are.
[09:13.87]I can't get him.
[09:14.61]Now there's a guy behind me.
[09:19.64]Why is this running so... This wasn't running like this before.
[09:22.10]I have to get the fucking new drivers.
[09:32.03]Lovely day.
[09:42.81]I have to make these guys run the other direction.
[09:47.75]Did I turn the settings down?
[09:48.69]Yeah, I don't know why.
[09:49.39]I think it's definitely a driver problem.
[10:02.48]Someone there?
[10:08.48]Quick, dump in the water.
[10:09.26]Water, water, water, water, water.
[10:14.90]Oh, fuck.
[10:16.22]Turn the water off.
[10:40.77]I dislike this stream.
[10:41.79]It's not quiet, man.
[10:42.98]Okay.
[10:49.82]Let's save it and get indoors before my computer breaks.
[10:58.86]Hitman!
[11:00.38]It's time... I have nothing.
[11:03.90]I don't know what to say.
[11:09.94]Approach reception.
[11:10.70]Here we go.
[11:10.98]We're going to do this fun mission.
[11:12.46]Look at the executive floor.
[11:13.24]He finally ran out of jokes.
[11:14.90]Oh, I got so many.
[11:15.68]It's just some of the... I run a joke library up there, and a lot of the books are overdue, so I'm just kind of waiting for them to be returned.
[11:37.24]This is running like dog shit.
[11:39.68]It wasn't doing this before.
[11:53.79]Hold on.
[11:54.19]Let me just go get the driver.
[11:56.53]I'm going to open Quiet Man up in the background while we get the driver.
[11:58.99]I don't know why it's doing this.
[12:04.36]It's like unplayable actually.
[12:05.74]I don't know why it's doing it now.
[12:11.48]Oh, I'll get it quick.
[12:12.14]I have 10,000 down.
[12:16.19]Oh fuck, wait.
[12:16.97]Will this turn off the stream?
[12:19.39]It shouldn't, right?
[12:26.15]No, is this gonna turn off the stream?
[12:27.30]Alright, I'll be right back if it does.
[12:38.60]This one just came out.
[12:40.57]Optimized for Hitman.
[12:42.05]It actually is.
[12:43.39]It actually is.
[12:44.09]This one came out like a week ago.
[12:46.67]Alright, let's get it.
[12:48.79]Hopefully it's the right one.
[12:51.01]Turn the facecam on.
[12:51.93]I don't have a webcam.
[12:54.43]I don't have a webcam plugged in.
[12:59.21]It's alright.
[12:59.51]It's already done downloading.
[13:00.95]I'm ready.
[13:05.29]I told you.
[13:05.73]I have 10,000 done.
[13:12.33]Plug in a webcam.
[13:15.47]Lies.
[13:15.83]Alright, I hope this doesn't turn off OBS.
[13:19.12]If not, I'm going to press the button and come right back.
[13:20.92]But I cannot play like that.
[13:22.72]It's just, it's not going to happen.
[13:26.42]Here we go.
[13:28.66]Yes, I'd like to install the drivers.
[13:38.09]Hey, let's put this up.
[13:38.85]There we go.
[13:39.27]Look, I'll be right back.
[13:42.33]That was a virus noise?
[13:43.45]No, it wasn't.
[13:43.93]That was a weird installing noise.
[13:47.05]Don't install the GeForce experience.
[13:48.56]I don't, I just get the driver and I say, no, thank you.
[13:52.26]Alright, 55%. 75%.
[14:05.27]Guys, I mean, this just proves that everyone says upgrade your PC, upgrade your PC.
[14:09.57]I mean, I have a dual core Celeron processor from like 2008 or 2007.
[14:16.08]So it's still good and it still works perfectly fine.
[14:27.20]Checking system compatibility.
[14:29.46]It's compatible, just get it so I don't have to deal with the Hitman issue.
[14:36.99]Come on, I got hungry people here.
[14:38.65]I got hungry customers here.
[14:41.94]I just went in the back and I'm out of pizza.
[14:46.02]There's no pizza dough ready.
[14:47.62]And there's like a line of people waiting for the pizza.
[14:49.52]And I'm the guy on the manager running in the fucking back going like, where are the fucking pizzas?
[14:54.67]Hurry.
[15:01.01]It's still testing my system compatibility.
[15:04.38]Roll the dough out, get it in the oven, and fucking put toppings on it.
[15:07.82]Now.
[15:10.42]Got it.
[15:13.85]Alright, here it comes.
[15:15.83]I'll be right back.
[15:16.67]If this stream turns off, I'll be back in two seconds.
[15:18.75]49% of the restaurants want pasta.
[15:26.11]Well, that's alright.
[15:29.21]We'll just- we'll just- there'll be a station to the left of the pizzas where you can put the fucking pizza into a blender and then it pisses out pasta.
[15:39.02]I don't know, guys.
[15:39.64]I'm trying to install a driver.
[15:40.88]I'm trying to- I don't know.
[15:43.52]I don't know.
[15:49.12]My stream's gonna like turn off.
[15:50.96]Fucking quiet, man.
[16:05.13]The pizza shop is currently on fire.
[16:07.95]No, we're good.
[16:08.51]We're gonna get back into it.
[16:09.51]We're gonna be just fine.
[16:14.66]But correct me if I'm wrong, but the last Hitman stream I did, it was not like that, right?
[16:20.54]It happened every so often, but it wasn't a constant issue.
[16:30.60]Alright, we're going.
[16:31.44]We're going.
[16:31.82]It's going.
[16:34.16]How do I like- I need to like turn on a webcam.
[16:37.02]Do I have any webcams up here that I just plug in?
[16:43.85]How do I- okay, there are- hold on.
[16:46.95]Alright, here's a shitty webcam that I'm gonna plug in.
[16:54.32]Okay.
[16:55.16]Is this gonna- Am I live?
[16:57.96]My whole computer is flashing.
[17:00.12]I think we're live still, are we?
[17:03.37]But my display just got darker.
[17:11.12]Are we- we're not live anymore?
[17:17.74]Why can I not- my other monitors are off.
[17:31.29]Oh god.
[17:41.27]Curse of the quiet man.
[17:44.33]Alright, it's done.
[17:45.27]It's pretty much, it's done.
[17:46.17]It's just finishing up.
[17:52.17]Even your PC wants to play Quiet Van.
[17:55.79]Alright, to complete installation, restart the computer.
[17:58.31]No, restart later.
[17:59.41]I don't have time for this shit.
[18:03.81]I don't have time for this shit.
[18:06.49]Alright, display.
[18:07.75]Where's...
[18:10.24]What the fuck?
[18:14.02]Don't, I don't, it doesn't detect any other displays.
[18:18.80]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[18:27.55]Well, encoding overload, consider turning down the video settings, is what OBS just said.
[18:38.48]I'm at a 90% CPU right now.
[18:42.78]I gotta get out of here.
[18:43.52]I'll be right back.
[18:44.04]I gotta go.
[18:45.44]I actually have to go.
[18:46.09]I'm at 90% CPU.
[18:47.11]I'll be right back.
[18:49.97]Alright, let's try it.
[18:55.21]Let's see what happens.
[19:03.68]This reminds me of my favorite game, The Quiet Man.
[19:05.84]If I just stayed in The Quiet Man, none of this would have happened.
[19:22.71]I'm back.
[19:23.29]I'm back.
[19:23.82]I'm coming back.
[19:27.54]Can't argue with that.
[19:31.32]Here we go.
[19:33.72]Count backwards.
[19:37.74]Alright, get that off the screen.
[19:42.84]Let's see if it fixed it.
[19:44.92]I can see chat.
[19:45.68]I restarted.
[19:46.63]I got all my shit ready.
[19:49.49]I'm ready to go.
[19:55.12]Let's just load where we just were and hopefully I don't, I don't run it like nine frames per second.
[20:08.38]Why the quiet man's currently trying to get captured.
[20:12.38]Hey, hi guy.
[20:13.62]What the fuck are you doing?
[20:19.90]Jesus Christ.
[20:28.66]Oh, hey!

[20:30.36]Hey, everybody!
[20:31.20]How are you?

[21:00.96]No, I just want a better menu than Xbox One.
[21:05.67]Like, I just want to load my game.
[21:30.81]I have to buy my... Okay, whatever.
[21:36.41]I'm just gonna love this.
[21:46.90]It's underfeatured.
[21:50.86]The one tab, it should be on the fucking first page.
[21:59.40]It's like in Windows 8.
[22:05.28]It is the first page, but let's be on the second page too!
[22:07.84]Load!
[22:09.90]Okay, God!
[22:11.73]Go, start it!
[22:12.57]Hey, welcome to the stream everybody!
[22:13.87]I was playing the Quiet Man, we were making lasagna references, and now I'm angry playing Hitman 2!
[22:27.02]What the fuck is going on?
[22:27.98]The race is entering its final lap, 47.
[22:32.17]47 the race is over Sierra will be coming off the track anytime now it fixed it it actually fixed it We're good game is fixed Alright, let's settle down everyone just relax I
[22:58.21]Okay.
[22:59.25]By the way, the mission was on a timer.
[23:04.59]It's not on a timer.
[23:11.10]We're fine.
[23:11.62]Everything's fine.
[23:12.22]Everything's good to go.
[23:12.84]Let's play Hitman 2.
[23:14.40]Am I allowed up here?
[23:21.41]Okay, go to the executive floor.
[23:25.89]I'm lagging?
[23:26.67]I shouldn't be.
[23:31.28]I shouldn't be lagging.
[23:37.97]Not fixed.
[23:43.77]Turn off this... I... Are we witnessing, like, the death of my graphics card live?
[23:48.59]Did playing the Quiet Man, like, break my computer, actually?
[23:53.90]Check OBS.
[23:55.30]OBS looks okay right now.
[23:57.24]Go back to quiet mode.
[23:59.28]Live exercise in progress.
[24:01.96]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[24:03.89]Let's save it.
[24:24.77]I am getting, like, OBS.
[24:26.75]I streamed this entire... This is what annoys me the most.
[24:30.41]I streamed this entire game.
[24:33.35]The whole thing.
[24:34.35]Every mission.
[24:36.46]Without any, like, encoding issues.
[24:38.12]And I didn't change any settings.
[24:39.32]So what the fuck is going on?
[24:42.60]Save scum.
[24:51.72]This traffic was rough.
[24:53.04]You have to finish quiet, man.
[24:56.54]I'm gonna say something provocative now, Ted.
[24:59.30]War is going out of fashion.
[25:01.78]It's dirty.
[25:02.36]It's just plain bad PR.
[25:04.49]Cursed.
[25:04.75]Hey, I'm trying to listen to this.
[25:24.52]Ready to strike at a moment's notice.
[25:26.93]Indestructible robotic operators who can infiltrate the deepest sanctuary of any adversary.
[25:33.93]This quiet man's not still running in the background.
[25:39.46]world imagine an army of them fully equipped android medics seeking out wounded servicemen and injured civilians bringing them to safety or patching them up then and there android pilots delivering payloads deep inside enemy territory
[25:58.24]so picture of target dummies and minimal collateral damage alright mendez it's very straightforward let me show you so I have to sabotage this thing pictures on the desk then I use the scanner to upload the biometric data and palace will do the rest so this thing okay
[26:19.18]Am I going to turn this thing around and shoot everybody?
[26:22.80]No, there's no way it's still running.
[26:27.65]I restarted my computer.
[26:28.71]I had to turn the stream off.
[26:31.59]There ain't anything else running.
[26:33.07]Picture of target dummy, picture of target... I need a picture of you.
[26:46.41]So I need to get a picture of him first.
[26:48.88]I may have missed my opportunity here.
[26:50.20]Alright, target dummy C. Let's do them all at the same time.
[27:06.90]Ready Mendez?
[27:08.40]Any image on the table?
[27:10.43]Activate palace.
[27:15.75]There's no way it's running in the background.
[27:16.99]If this is running in the background, there's no fucking way.
[27:45.90]Hold on.
[27:46.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[27:49.54]Five?
[27:53.23]No, no, no, no.
[27:55.17]I've restarted the computer.
[27:56.91]No, there's no way.
[28:00.23]No.
[28:02.43]And you prefer the traditional approach.
[28:04.57]I respect that.
[28:05.69]It is like running like shit.
[28:06.83]What happened to my computer?
[28:07.71]This is the future you're looking at.
[28:09.67]Autonomous synthetic systems will entirely remove human agents.
[28:13.61]What does five mean?
[28:17.50]This thing will absolutely murder anything you put it up against.
[28:22.40]Sounds promising.
[28:23.72]So, Mr. Mendez, impressive so far?
[28:25.68]It is pretty impressive, so let me find a picture of you and shoot you.
[28:27.86]Let me quickly show you our on-site robotics lab.
[28:30.32]It's small, but state-of-the-art, and it's fully mobile.
[28:33.08]Go get a new PC in the meeting room.
[28:39.14]Check HW... No, I can see my CPU.
[28:43.19]I have no idea.
[28:45.07]I haven't been able to, like, lock in and pay attention.
[28:51.70]I really should just go back and play Quiet Man.
[29:01.70]Yeah, I am... My computer is fucked up.
[29:09.07]My CPU is being overloaded right now.
[29:15.39]I have no answer for this.
[29:21.58]My CPU is being overloaded now.
[29:31.20]I need a computer doctor.
[29:42.75]Check OBS to see if it's using CPU or GPU encoding.
[29:45.19]The driver update probably caused it to get switched.
[29:48.57]God dammit.
[29:51.51]I was just playing.
[29:53.14]I was just playing.
[29:56.26]The quiet fan.
[30:03.69]No, no, everything's fine.
[30:12.53]No, it looks fine.
[30:19.11]Maybe something... No, I played in this exact mission.
[30:23.47]I was in the same exact spot.
[30:25.43]Not even a week ago.
[30:26.47]And this wasn't happening.
[30:28.87]It's unfortunate that this is kind of taking over the stream right now.
[30:33.73]This is bad.
[30:35.65]This is real bad.
[30:41.38]Um...
[30:53.84]Yeah, it's on it's on h.264 I just looked It is I can't I'm just like sad
[31:22.38]This stream is a mess leaving.
[31:23.66]I'm sorry.
[31:24.82]I did not expect my, like, CPU to overload and overheat and go get all fucked up.
[31:33.07]It was, like, kind of funny at first.
[31:34.23]Now I'm actually just kind of sad about it.
[31:35.79]Uh, let me, uh, I'm gonna reload here.
[31:48.03]I'm gonna change this.
[31:54.63]Clean out the dust.
[31:55.39]Inside is pristine.
[31:57.94]There's no dust in there at all.
[31:59.16]Let me show you everything.
[32:08.39]I'm not gonna go back a little further.
[32:09.55]Oh, I'm so defeated right now.
[32:11.99]Because, like, if Etalyx just had, like, major computer problems... Etalyx's computer was smoking.
[32:17.29]And, like, almost lit on fire.
[32:19.39]And now... My CPU is, like, fucking going crazy.
[32:24.63]Huh?
[32:25.63]Why?
[32:27.25]Why are we cursed?
[32:32.62]Um...
[32:36.78]No, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go back here.
[32:44.53]I'm gonna go to... Because I, like... I'm sorry I wasn't able to, like, really completely engross myself and pay attention to that.
[32:50.47]My mind's been somewhere else, as you are very well aware.
[32:53.25]So let's, um... I'm gonna do, like, this one.
[33:04.25]I need to get, like, a picture of him, but I just didn't do it.
[33:08.35]Unfortunately.
[33:08.93]Hold on.
[33:15.20]Let me go and find the photo.
[33:24.78]Yeah, I'm sorry, everybody.
[33:26.24]I'm sorry that technical problems have taken the stream over once again.
[33:32.54]Okay, let's see.
[33:33.40]Picture of him in here?
[33:34.80]Is there a photo of him in here?
[33:35.74]Okay, I can do it.
[33:36.76]Now I have to go back to quiet.
[33:38.84]Alright, where's that demonstration?
[34:02.34]Alright, I'm back.
[34:07.97]And I have something for you.
[34:08.79]Go stand over there, buddy.
[34:10.05]Alright, here we go.
[34:10.91]I'm gonna get him.
[34:32.51]This isn't less laggy than it was last time?
[34:37.37]Yeah, but last time I was not getting encoding errors.
[34:40.52]I can look at my CPU right now and it's going way harder than it was last time.
[34:43.22]Yeah, this is all turned off and down and everything.
[34:45.60]It's not this.
[35:03.04]Yeah, Task Manager is... there's nothing there.
[35:04.80]Turn Vsync off?
[35:09.42]It was already... was it off before?
[35:10.96]That, like, made it worse.
[35:13.38]Bet3, thanks for the five community subs.
[35:15.48]Switch to the other computer.
[35:17.69]Well, I have to turn the stream off again.
[35:32.92]I really don't want to troubleshoot live here.
[35:35.70]And like, oh, I'm going to turn the stream off.
[35:37.44]Back on.
[35:37.84]Stream's off.
[35:38.38]Back on.
[35:38.83]I'll just do it for now.
[35:39.37]I think we're good.
[35:39.81]Unplug my webcam.
[36:02.72]Nah, it's not that.
[36:03.40]Alright, let's do it.
[36:04.58]Hey look, I have a picture here.
[36:07.18]I wonder whose picture this is.
[36:08.36]Photo of Robert Knox.
[36:34.82]It was that easy.
[36:37.53]I mean, I pressed the button.
[36:45.66]Wouldn't they come over to me and be like, hey, what the hell did you just do?
[36:56.03]Oh, come on, he's not... Hold on, wait, I stayed here for too long?
[36:58.95]Really?
[36:59.11]Okay.
[36:59.23]Did I actually just get caught?
[37:00.37]I was thinking that guy was gonna get shot in the back of the head.
[37:25.46]There's new settings in the game.
[37:28.58]Really.
[37:34.46]I mean, I don't see anything that's different from last time.
[37:45.40]I don't see anything different.
[37:47.78]Is it running better now?
[37:49.24]We'll see.
[37:49.78]We'll deal with it.
[37:51.33]Wee.
[37:53.95]Woo!
[37:55.37]I was doing that before, but not as hard as that.
[38:00.62]A new option that I can't change.
[38:02.24]Alright, let's do... Let's get rid of the... Let's do another mission.
[38:10.68]So, this is... I can't do this one now, but maybe I can do this one.
[38:13.53]Intravenous.
[38:17.87]Do the Quiet Man mission.
[38:22.27]Failing hard drive?
[38:25.01]I don't know.
[38:29.57]I brought a fish.
[38:30.25]I didn't even bring my actual tools.
[38:40.79]I hope Jerma doesn't get upset from streams like these.
[38:42.81]I do.
[38:44.61]I do.
[38:45.09]But not like anyone in particular, right?
[38:49.62]It's not like I'm angry with you guys or anything.
[38:54.82]Like, I can't believe this.
[38:55.78]How did I get... It just kind of sucks.
[38:59.18]You know?
[39:01.23]Hey, what's up?
[39:01.87]I was having fun and now I have to live troubleshoot computer problems.
[39:06.69]Why is there a dinosaur over here?
[39:08.91]No, I'm good.
[39:14.13]I'm good.
[39:17.09]Where's the T-Rex?
[39:19.86]Is this Lady?
[39:20.46]Holy shit, you weigh like 5,000 pounds.
[39:25.07]For the record, I voted for Quiet Man.
[39:33.61]Yeah, but I would have run into it eventually.
[39:36.07]So... Better now than ever, you know what I mean?
[39:38.67]Better now than never.
[39:39.33]Hey, how'd you know I'm bald?
[39:51.77]Can I go through here?
[39:54.41]I'm allowed to go through this way, but... Let's see.
[40:02.85]I probably should put his outfit on.
[40:04.29]Anybody else around?
[40:16.22]Better off than on.
[40:17.94]No.
[40:19.80]You have a key?
[40:21.59]Wait, you got a key on you?
[40:24.43]You have a gun, but you don't have to give a key.
[40:32.99]Alright, come with me.
[40:35.51]That should at least give me access to this next part.
[40:43.81]Better quiet than Hitman.
[40:52.83]Ghost mode has more optimization.
[40:55.67]You know, I'm sure it does.
[41:05.98]I should have a broken neck counter?
[41:10.32]Whoo.
[41:11.36]I'm gonna bring him over here.
[41:13.04]I can't.
[41:13.46]He's fine.
[41:14.70]No one's gonna give a shit.
[41:18.24]Why can I not... Why was I grayed out?
[41:21.08]Alright, open this from the inside so I can run out there if I need to.
[41:32.52]The hornets are back.
[41:37.92]How you been?
[41:38.90]I've been great.
[41:42.20]Sir?
[41:55.70]Can I like get in front of the camera?
[41:59.48]That's a nice camera.
[42:10.14]Sir, can you please get out of there?
[42:19.55]Body found?
[42:20.30]Who found that body?
[42:22.00]I'm trespassing, I'm trespassing, I'm trespassing here.
[42:25.38]I'm supposed to be security.
[42:26.34]What, mall security is not allowed back here?
[42:28.06]We might have a situation.
[42:44.11]Someone just got an a- alright, let's finish this guy.
[42:49.13]How are you... What?
[42:51.67]I just beat the shit out of this guy and he got right back up.
[43:01.08]Alright, I need a place to dump him.
[43:08.01]This way.
[43:09.13]Come with me.
[43:19.11]Quiet Man versus Sneak Man.
[43:32.04]Quiet Man doesn't kill.
[43:33.08]What?
[43:33.70]Assuming I didn't kill all those guys?
[43:35.20]Alright, so I need to go that way, in there.
[43:51.27]Hey, bye.
[43:53.81]Alright, here we go.
[43:55.05]Medical tent.
[43:56.79]Story revealing itself.
[43:59.90]Well, let's just say she's got a bad case of intermittent explosive disorder.
[44:04.20]That was a diarrhea.
[44:06.36]First, he almost loses a patient.
[44:08.13]She's got intermittent explosive diarrhea.
[44:11.47]Now he has to deal with this guy suffering from urinary retention.
[44:16.48]Not his day.
[44:17.74]Let's just hope he doesn't somehow screw up the revitalization procedure on Miss Knox.
[44:23.04]I know it's just a simple injection, but given his track record these past few days... Well, at least we know who's buying us beer tonight.
[44:31.17]Ain't that the truth?
[44:33.55]Okay.
[44:34.59]So.
[44:35.07]So, it seems Sierra Knox has jumped on the revitalization bandwagon and is scheduled for an injection of some sort.
[44:42.40]The doctor who was supposed to help her with the procedure...
[44:45.69]Okay, so I gotta get in here.
[44:46.63]There's a doctor.
[44:47.17]I'm gonna turn into this doctor and I'm gonna poison.
[44:49.55]Alright, can I sprint through?
[44:51.33]If I sprint as fast as I fucking can, can I get through?
[44:54.15]Oh, I'm allowed back here.
[44:54.76]Never mind.
[45:12.90]I thought they were going to be like, sir, you can't go back there.
[45:14.92]You're not allowed.
[45:18.06]I'm going to have to ask you to get a move on now.
[45:20.74]I have Sierra Knox coming in next for a post race.
[45:23.70]I don't want to keep her waiting.
[45:28.53]Surely you must be able to squeeze out.
[45:30.63]I can throw him in there.
[45:32.65]You've inhaled around a gallon of water by now.
[45:39.11]How do I imitate his voice?
[46:00.71]Don't go in the closet.
[46:02.80]That was just in time.
[46:08.34]Oh shit, I need poison.
[46:13.68]I need poison.
[46:15.06]I don't have any poison.
[46:16.74]Uh-oh.
[46:18.28]Where can I get some poison?
[46:19.52]Poison?
[46:20.46]No, that's a sink.
[46:22.66]Poisonous sink?
[46:23.30]Go, go, go!
[46:34.37]Medical staff only.
[46:35.13]I'm allowed in here.
[46:35.75]Here we go.
[46:36.17]We got poison.
[46:37.75]Lethal poison jar.
[46:38.95]Ugh.
[46:42.93]Okay.
[46:45.31]Find a key or a crowbar?
[46:49.58]Why don't I... Find a key or a crowbar.
[46:53.64]Call Sierra to emergency.
[46:57.57]Find a key?
[46:58.85]Why do I need to find a key?
[46:59.91]Dr. Reaper.
[47:00.57]Alright, well there's a key over here.
[47:01.75]Okay.

[48:06.21]Illegal.
[48:06.59]I don't have anything to throw at him.
[48:14.20]He'll be alright.

[49:18.42]Okay, I'm putting it in the line.
[49:19.44]So it's in the line now.
[49:20.24]Come on in.
[49:24.68]Dr. ResidentSleeper.
[49:27.68]Am I going to give her a haircut too?
[49:39.14]Stop killing people.
[49:40.46]I didn't... I just had to... But yeah, I'm sorry.
[49:45.71]I have nothing there.
[49:46.99]I have nothing to combat that.
[49:52.79]That's a pretty good excuse though.
[50:05.49]Does nobody find it weird that the back of your head is branded?
[50:08.29]Well... I mean, you could always just talk about how... the tattoo you got when you were younger.
[50:13.73]Because you're such a fan of the Hitman games.
[50:23.52]Dr. Lasagna.
[50:28.11]Everybody makes that joke because it's a funny joke.
[50:30.73]Can I tell her to come in?
[50:31.45]Get in here.
[50:34.00]I'm ready.
[50:35.54]You.
[50:36.76]Right there.
[50:38.02]Let's go.
[50:38.34]Okay.
[50:40.52]Thanks for the input, lady.
[50:42.50]Really great GTA pedestrian thing to say.
[51:00.33]Alright, Doug.
[51:01.39]Where do you want me?
[51:02.25]Miss Knox, come on in.
[51:04.60]Have a seat and relax.
[51:06.04]So, what's on the menu?
[51:07.30]Ugh, can you just get away from me?
[51:09.68]Have you never heard of personal space?
[51:11.62]I promise.
[51:12.08]Shut up.
[51:12.64]Once I'm done, you won't feel a thing.
[51:16.26]Alright, sit in that chair.
[51:17.12]With that one.berger.
[51:17.74]So, what's the next thing anyway, Doug?
[51:19.22]Mostly floral extracts.
[51:21.30]Hemlock, belladonna, aconite.
[51:24.16]I changed disguises.
[51:24.78]How is she going to die?
[51:25.76]Choke?
[51:26.44]Puke?
[51:26.54]Or just roll over in the chair?
[51:27.36]What do you think?
[51:54.70]Hey, you know what?
[51:55.62]I do feel refreshed.
[51:57.26]Thanks, Doc.
[51:58.09]My pleasure, Ms.
[51:59.09]Knox.
[52:04.17]Is she gonna puke?
[52:06.57]Oh, God!
[52:07.17]I gotta call my dermatologist back.
[52:09.11]Don't worry.
[52:10.39]It'll be over soon, Ms.
[52:11.71]Knox.
[52:17.09]Both targets down.
[52:18.71]Well done, 47.
[52:20.27]Head for an exit, and we'll speak again soon.
[52:24.64]Clean.
[52:28.68]Clean.
[52:29.50]Oh, there's an exit right here.
[52:32.79]Excellent!
[52:45.79]Spotless.
[52:53.30]Okay, now it's time.
[52:56.35]Just go on an absolute insanity run.
[53:01.29]Okay.
[53:10.46]So let's replay the mission.
[53:13.24]Actually, let's do next and see what we unlocked.
[53:16.00]Stands toilet.
[53:17.76]Sniper rifle.
[53:19.50]Stands.
[53:21.76]Okay, cool.
[53:29.45]Alright, so now let's go back to the menu.
[53:33.36]Challenges, a man in the sea.
[53:34.74]Assassinate him with a fish trophy.
[53:43.04]Sands.
[53:43.62]Alright, let's go back.
[53:45.12]I want to replay the mission.
[53:50.92]Replan mission for a second.
[53:55.75]I want to bring in to the toilets...
[54:11.27]okay let's start at the uh I start with this costume on dolphin fountain I guess I'll start in the stands start the public toilet I want to see how fast I can eliminate both targets
[54:36.00]And get up.
[54:36.54]He's getting into character here.
[54:38.06]Hold on.
[54:38.36]Wait a minute.
[54:38.72]Can I... Let me see if I can do this.
[54:40.12]Okay.
[55:12.02]Look at those lap times.
[55:14.84]Guess he's out to show Matthias Schuster, who's number one.
[55:23.50]What?
[55:24.32]Oh, I got him.
[55:25.14]What?
[55:25.84]We were just talking about it.
[55:28.32]This is such a mass effect.
[55:31.18]Holy shit.
[55:31.94]It's going to be easy on the throttle coming into those corners.
[55:34.91]But let's, uh.
[55:35.99]Nobody.
[55:37.27]Let's see what happened here, because that's definitely a bad, bad situation.
[55:43.67]Nobody... What about the ones that are driving in now?
[55:50.35]This... They're gonna smash?
[55:52.64]Into it?
[55:53.10]No.
[55:53.16]I don't think they can hit it.
[55:54.14]Wait a minute.
[56:16.67]That was a pretty quiet grenade.
[56:20.61]Do the Sean B mission?
[56:21.57]Yeah, I'll go do that.
[56:22.67]That sounds like fun.
[56:24.79]That's the patient zero, right?
[56:27.09]Anyway, let's wait.
[56:46.51]Fuck.
[56:46.75]That guy died?
[57:31.96]I'm trying to punch this guy.
[57:34.34]Why can't I punch this guy?
[57:36.66]Alright, let's do the other mission.
[57:40.21]Wait, hold on.
[57:40.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[57:41.93]Hold on.
[57:52.12]Bird.
[57:52.68]For newcomers to Endurance Race, let me remind you that this is...
[57:58.81]How did I... Two hours later.
[58:00.89]No, no, no!
[58:03.33]No!
[58:32.40]I was trying to throw it over.
[58:33.66]Okay, elusive target.
[58:48.99]47.
[58:49.73]Good morning.
[58:50.29]Your target is Mark Faber, also known as the Undying.
[58:54.90]A disgraced former MI5 operative currently working as a freelance assassin, Faber has been confirmed killed by ICA agents more than a dozen times.
[59:04.55]On every occasion, he has managed to come back from the dead.
[59:09.81]We have confirmation that Faber has a meeting in the Miami Bayside Center to review details on a new target.
[59:16.45]An informant at the site has provided us with reliable intel on Faber's expected movement around the city.
[59:22.15]This information has revealed several viable approaches.
[59:25.76]As you know, our inside man is meeting with the target.
[59:29.74]Acquire the right disguise, and he'll get you inside the heart of the building.
[59:34.02]Up close and personal is risky, but favors the clean kill.
[59:38.46]I like that idea.
[59:39.14]That's what I'm doing.
[59:40.84]I'll get it.
[59:54.56]Or infiltrate through the staff entrance at the back of the building.
[59:58.66]Access the second floor using the elevator shaft.
[60:01.82]Move unseen inside the weapons demo room and infiltrate as you see fit.
[60:06.69]Act once an opportunity presents itself or rig the room to your advantage.
[60:11.15]Leave unseen.
[60:12.51]Be mindful, however.
[60:14.31]The repercussions of being exposed here would be severe.
[60:16.95]I'm going for the sniper nest.
[60:24.58]I'm so ready for this.
[60:36.88]One chance.
[60:37.56]You cannot replay a target.
[60:38.86]You only get one chance.
[60:39.94]If you die, that's it.
[60:40.92]Game over.
[60:41.52]You only have one time, one window, one death.
[60:43.62]That's it.
[60:44.04]Okay.
[60:44.70]I can't fuck this up.
[60:50.29]Alright, planning.
[60:52.23]I... Okay.
[60:54.73]Oh, that makes me so nervous.
[60:56.16]Okay, briefcase.
[61:00.04]I want to put in the briefcase a shotgun.
[61:03.98]No, don't be an idiot.
[61:06.00]This thing.
[61:07.34]A mace.
[61:07.64]I'm going to kill him with a mace.
[61:09.17]No.
[61:10.25]No.
[61:17.18]What do I have for... I don't have any other costumes.
[61:19.70]Alright, I got it in the briefcase.
[61:20.74]I'm going to lockpick.
[61:24.16]Okay, that's in the briefcase.
[61:27.26]Smuggle a fish.
[61:29.68]Not a bad idea.
[61:35.40]I can't.
[61:36.00]How about a duck?
[61:40.04]Alright, one chance.
[61:40.80]That's it.
[61:41.18]All I got.
[61:43.86]I'm ready.
[61:47.76]this contract is an elusive target and playing an elusive target the following rules apply you must begin the contract before the countdown expires if you die you may not retry once you've completed the contract and successfully exited you may not retry the contract you may no longer restart the contract you cannot save your game shit
[62:18.18]He already failed?
[62:19.12]I don't say that yet.
[62:20.43]It hasn't happened yet.
[62:21.21]Okay.
[62:22.79]Eliminate Mark Faba.
[62:47.32]He's already inside.
[62:51.26]And there's Jerma.
[62:52.11]Talk to Dave.
[62:55.31]Oh, fuck.
[62:55.47]Alright, well, hold on.
[62:56.45]Where...
[63:17.99]Can I go in here?
[63:20.39]Dave's ready.
[63:20.91]Are you?
[63:21.37]Not yet, but I'm gonna have to try.
[63:23.35]Hey, what's going on, Dave?
[63:28.18]Dave is ready.
[63:29.90]Hmm.
[63:30.10]Hmm.
[63:49.85]I thought I was going to be a sniper?
[63:50.67]Oh, yeah.
[63:50.87]Okay.
[63:50.99]Hold on.
[63:51.19]Mission stories.
[63:51.91]Okay.
[63:52.03]I need to be an engineer.
[64:38.38]OK, got it.
[64:40.56]Briefcase and key card.
[64:44.54]Alright, Dave, I'm ready.
[64:50.81]How's this?
[64:51.57]Where'd you find that?
[64:53.63]Never mind.
[64:54.15]I don't want to know.
[64:55.21]Let's go.
[64:56.05]Fave is already expecting us up there.
[64:57.83]Can't wait to meet him.
[64:59.27]Oh, god.
[65:00.01]But hold on.
[65:00.59]Where are my exits?
[65:06.60]I have a sniper rifle in this briefcase.
[65:08.36]Are they gonna search me?
[65:09.20]Is there a place I can snipe from here?
[65:29.20]Hold on, this guy can see right through me.
[65:30.30]Oh my god, computer, why are you doing this?
[65:32.38]Oh fuck, okay, I gotta get this right.
[66:04.14]Hey, how you doing?
[66:06.44]So, we finally meet.
[66:09.74]You don't quite look like I expected.
[66:12.62]I'm not Faber.
[66:14.56]Mr. Faber!
[66:16.12]What an absolute pleasure to meet you.
[66:18.56]I'm Dave Reddy, special acquisition gatekeeper working with you on this job.
[66:22.82]I'd show you my breakbook, but I'm sure you've already heard about me.
[66:27.02]Can't say that I have.
[66:28.38]Oh, uh, I see.
[66:32.85]Before we begin, I just wanted to tell you that I read up on your file.
[66:37.48]Oh, I am very impressed.
[66:43.06]It's all about enjoyment.
[66:44.46]Couldn't agree more, my friend.
[66:46.99]I've prepped an extensive briefing to help us sync up on the... It's open.
[66:58.13]Please help!
[66:59.01]Help me!
[67:05.45]What is that?
[67:57.17]I did it.
[68:05.64]I did it.
[68:06.00]I did it.
[68:06.28]I gotta get out of here though.
[68:07.32]Get out.
[68:12.55]I'm gonna burn this computer.
[68:54.99]Explosive penmanship, day at the aquarium, and a clean headshot.
[69:04.42]One.
[69:06.12]Better than zero.
[69:13.57]Boat rental hut.
[69:15.77]HWK 21 MK2.
[69:18.37]Explosive pen.
[69:21.97]Florida fit with gloves.
[69:25.76]Are you supposed to kill him creatively?
[69:28.82]I'm not good enough for that, man.
[69:33.60]See?
[69:33.88]That's all I want is the checkbox.
[69:35.06]I just want to get the diploma.
[69:41.53]Alright, let's go to... Let's go to this neighborhood place.
[69:51.37]So, let's start... I want to start in the construction area.
[69:58.03]Okay.
[70:00.65]I do have this now, but that's not silenced.
[70:03.75]Not like it matters.
[70:08.11]I can't believe you shot that guy and looked cool doing it.
[70:12.50]Alright, briefcase.
[70:14.06]I can't take that with the current disguise?
[70:16.40]Oh, I guess not.
[70:18.76]A fish is okay.
[70:21.26]That's not suspicious.
[70:25.08]Apparently there's a grenade.
[70:28.31]Alright, we'll take the pen.
[70:32.65]Alright, so let's see what we got for mission stories here.
[70:37.76]Pest control, house for sale.
[70:41.68]Whack-a-mole, we did that one.
[70:42.88]No smoking area.
[70:48.52]What about pest control?
[70:50.06]Or house for sale?
[70:51.78]Yeah, let's do house for sale.
[71:01.24]Oh my god.
[71:04.60]What?
[71:05.18]Alright, let's go.
[71:26.36]You show him rooms in a house.
[71:27.56]We'll find out.
[71:29.59]Did I put it on casual?
[71:30.85]No, I didn't.
[71:31.29]Did I?
[71:31.53]So I'm pretending... Don't I have to get an application to work here?
[71:44.94]Why is 47 just a construction worker?
[71:57.20]Alright, so we got radio... No, no, no.
[71:59.60]I want to do the house for sale.
[72:01.58]I think I can see through me.
[72:02.70]Why would I even be here?
[72:03.60]No, don't throw things at people.
[72:08.02]Just do it.
[72:09.48]Don't throw...
[72:27.43]Wrenches.
[72:27.89]I almost said bricks.
[72:37.84]Jeremy loves roleplay stuff.
[72:40.64]It's kind of fun.
[72:45.46]Alright, here we go.
[72:47.54]This is the open house.
[72:50.39]I have to tell you.
[72:52.53]These are the best muffins I ever had.
[72:55.05]I'm supposed to meet a client for a house tour.
[72:59.48]but I can't stop eating.
[73:01.76]Maybe you know him.
[73:02.89]Mr. Nolan Cassidy?
[73:06.45]Hey, I'm not really comfortable with your proximity right now.
[73:12.79]I mean, I can just take as many as I want.
[73:14.39]I want them all.
[73:15.83]Give me all of them.
[73:17.23]Proximity mine?
[73:18.35]No.
[73:18.43]How do I make it explode?
[73:33.96]I just want to test it.
[73:35.44]Let me see what it does Anybody else feel that?
[74:03.26]So it's a grenade, but it also can kill people on contact.
[74:07.15]Okay.
[74:07.77]I can't stop eating.
[74:09.27]Maybe you know him.
[74:10.39]Mr. Nolan Cassidy?
[74:11.59]Alright.
[74:12.01]So this is the guy.
[74:12.71]This is the real estate guy.
[74:13.65]Well, he's interested in the Schmidt house down the road.
[74:16.35]You know, the one that police shut down after the, well, incident.
[74:19.90]I'm not really from around here.
[74:21.30]47.
[74:21.38]A real taste for the sweet things in life is in Whittleton Creek to show a house to Nolan Cassidy.
[74:27.26]It looks like he's stuck at a local muffin stand at the moment.
[74:29.99]It would be a shame to keep Cassidy waiting.
[74:33.97]Disguise as a server.
[74:36.55]Alright, so there's a server somewhere else.
[74:42.58]In one of these houses.
[74:47.98]The question is... Which house was he in?
[74:52.72]Kill him with a muffin.
[74:55.08]No, no.
[74:56.10]That's too easy.
[74:56.72]I want this guy to go on a break.
[75:00.56]Because I know there's another muffin person somewhere.
[75:12.47]I'm leaving, just hold on.
[75:16.63]What's my muffin of choice?
[75:17.45]Chocolate.
[75:18.83]Chocolate chip muffins.
[75:20.27]Or cornbread muffin.
[75:22.33]I'm definitely not a big muffin guy.
[75:23.98]Here's the party.
[75:35.22]Put muffin in mailbox.
[75:38.39]Muffin delivery service.
[75:40.13]I don't see the server here.
[75:43.37]He's a server.
[75:44.89]But is he though?
[75:46.33]He's kind of just a guy at the grill.
[75:48.30]Maybe that guy goes on a break.
[75:49.42]Do you go on a break?
[76:22.52]Close the fucking door.
[76:24.20]Oh, those are stale.
[76:33.47]Those are stale muffins.
[76:35.19]No!
[76:38.15]Is everybody else in the house?
[76:48.29]Where can I put this guy?
[76:53.79]Is there nowhere I can put you?
[76:57.53]Did I bring a fish?
[76:58.25]I did not bring a fish.
[77:02.43]No, he'll be fine.
[77:05.15]Just flush him down the toilet.
[77:07.31]Alright, obtain rat poison.
[77:14.99]I wish it was a spit button.
[77:28.45]Rat poison, and then we're gonna go become the realtor.
[77:34.20]Put him in the dryer.
[77:41.28]Knock, knock.
[77:42.86]I'm looking for my secret ingredient.
[77:44.86]Oh, what?
[77:49.04]What?
[77:54.75]Is this the guy that lost a Pinwheel?
[77:55.99]Yes.
[77:57.09]Yes.
[77:59.13]Yes, it was incredibly embarrassing.
[78:05.57]I couldn't believe it when it happened.
[78:07.71]I cried on stream.
[78:09.05]Tears were just streaming down my fucking face.
[78:12.81]I kept on going, like, I can't do it!
[78:14.83]I can't fucking do it!
[78:17.79]Everyone was just laughing.
[78:19.55]Laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing.
[78:21.13]Okay.
[78:29.02]Uh, where's the poison?
[78:35.66]I don't see any poison in here.
[78:36.85]Oh, there we go.
[78:40.15]Alright, place the muffin on a serving plate.
[78:51.25]I picked up a joint, yeah, apparently.
[78:55.33]Well, that guy's like, wait a minute, that guy's not me!
[78:59.16]How do I get rid of him?
[79:05.00]That guy can see right through me, then how am I supposed to get around him?
[79:15.32]Am I gonna just pretend to be this guy behind him?
[79:24.68]He's kind of distracted.
[79:25.82]Disguise yourself as a real estate broker.
[79:29.42]Strange.
[79:32.71]He just watched me do it.
[79:36.65]Even after watching, he's got a question mark.
[79:39.35]Huh?
[79:40.51]What?
[79:41.69]Hmm.
[79:42.39]I should try it.
[79:43.04]Welcome to Granny's.
[79:44.24]And thank you for shopping locally.
[79:46.76]We have a free muffin promotion going on today.
[79:49.28]So everyone can get a taste of our product and not just our hype.
[79:53.87]Eat the whole thing.
[79:54.61]Okay.
[79:55.45]Okay, what was that?
[79:56.55]That was weirdly Microsoft Sam in my ear.
[79:59.27]So where does he go?
[80:00.17]Wait, I can go in the sewer?
[80:40.79]Oh, what?
[80:41.26]I thought I was gonna shoot at him.
[80:43.68]That was so anticlimactic.
[80:44.94]I thought I was gonna spray straight in the line and hit him right in the back.
[80:51.99]Throw him down the sewer.
[80:53.09]Throw him down the sewer.
[80:53.97]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[80:58.70]Where are you going?
[81:18.07]I'm trying to make him smoke weed.
[81:24.07]Had to be this trash can.
[81:25.35]Yeah, why this trash can?
[81:29.00]Although, here's the problem.
[81:31.34]Okay, I got the key.
[81:35.34]I can stuff him in there.
[81:42.38]That was so loud.
[81:44.46]That's so loud.
[81:45.58]That was louder than anything.
[81:52.80]Put him in the trash can.
[81:54.04]I don't think I can put him.
[82:05.59]OK.
[82:06.49]Locate and approach Cassidy.
[82:07.65]Yeah, yeah.
[82:24.43]So where's Cassidy?
[82:43.40]This guy's just on the phone.
[82:49.63]It's the green icon.
[82:51.19]I know where it is.
[82:52.01]I'm just looking to see if there's anything else over here.
[82:56.49]Let's see if there's anything else to do.
[83:06.81]Throw the shovel at him.
[83:07.71]I'm not going to throw a shovel at him.
[83:08.67]I'm going to wait until we get in the house.
[83:11.18]Aren't you the realtor?
[83:12.48]Yes.
[83:12.70]Mr. Cassidy, I'm sorry for the delay.
[83:16.20]I'm ready to take you to the house.
[83:18.10]About time.
[83:19.94]Let's go.
[83:20.82]Poke him with the fish.
[83:21.80]Alright, unlock the door.
[83:23.76]Last one on the right, far end of the road.
[83:27.67]Alright, let's go.
[83:28.93]Do I have to just run ahead?
[83:30.23]Come on, let's go.
[83:34.89]I was planting trees.
[83:39.51]Behind the property.
[83:42.77]Pick up, what is it?
[83:43.77]Pick up note for real estate company.
[83:47.23]Unlock the door.
[83:55.44]See?
[83:55.68]It works.
[83:57.45]Who's investigating a distraction?
[83:59.19]Is somebody in this house?
[84:06.31]What are you doing in here?
[84:08.47]Alright, let's convince him to buy the house.
[84:10.33]Alright, thank you.
[84:10.79]Goodbye.
[84:21.10]Alright, the tour.
[84:22.76]So we have a television over here.
[84:23.98]There's a piano.
[84:24.64]TV.
[84:25.49]Take a look.
[84:28.59]Nice TV.
[84:30.69]This is the downstairs living room.
[84:33.43]It is most commonly used for watching television and other recreation.
[84:38.20]Yeah, would you like a fish, Stark?
[84:39.48]Well, that's why the shovel exists.
[84:40.80]This guy likes sushi.
[84:42.78]Alright, come up here.
[84:45.45]Follow me.
[85:14.06]Here's the bathroom.
[85:14.94]There's a lot of storage in the bathroom.
[85:16.38]Oh, hey!
[85:41.32]How are you?
[85:41.74]Okay, let's take a look at the upstairs.
[85:47.81]Look, there's a TV up here.
[85:48.75]What?
[85:52.48]I turned on the TV.
[85:53.40]Come up here and take a look at the attic.
[85:55.40]What?
[86:19.70]What are you doing?
[86:20.54]Hold on.
[86:20.88]I'm trying to storm the house.
[86:21.70]Yeah.
[86:22.28]You want to see it?
[86:27.52]Yeah.
[86:27.82]Come on.
[86:28.56]Come on.
[86:28.78]This way.
[86:29.02]This way.
[86:29.29]Well, I don't...
[86:49.81]Well, I can't even open this door.
[86:58.51]This room is small.
[86:59.42]I need to wow him.
[87:00.26]I really need to wow him with something.
[87:01.44]Who's that?
[87:15.44]Hey!
[87:21.22]Alright, let's do- Oh, wait.
[87:23.50]Yeah, I'm good right here.
[87:24.32]18-08.
[88:03.31]Let me see.
[88:08.39]Uh, Intel.
[88:09.33]I cleaned the place as requested.
[88:10.59]I was told the real estate agent would pick up the key, so I put it in the flower pot next to the door.
[88:16.39]Flower pot next to the door?
[88:19.25]Oh, this is like the president guy.
[88:21.15]Okay.
[88:41.09]Oh, I was like, where the fuck did he go?
[88:46.07]Okay, so we can go down here.
[88:50.65]Follow me.
[88:52.67]We'll show you something interesting.
[89:00.00]Ding dong, get your own house.
[89:02.16]Here you go.
[89:02.72]So as you see, the basement has ample room.
[89:08.65]And here's the basement.
[89:10.51]The usual boiler elements are to be found down here.
[89:14.80]And it seems a room with a safe of some sort.
[89:18.54]Now that is more like it.
[89:20.88]It's more like it.
[89:21.68]That looks like a vault.
[89:28.61]Unlock the vault door.
[89:30.71]Okay.
[89:31.35]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[89:33.03]Nice work, 47.
[89:34.51]Let's hope he doesn't set off the alarm somehow.
[89:37.01]Wait, what?
[89:39.75]I don't understand why he's... Is he about to get murdered?
[89:41.53]Push him in?
[89:41.83]What if I go in?
[89:42.43]Well, what do you know?
[89:43.03]It worked.
[90:09.65]Looks like Schmidt was a bigger amateur than I imagined.
[90:16.00]Is he gonna go in?
[90:23.11]Go outside and check the garden.
[90:24.47]I want to know how visible this vault is from the outside.
[90:28.45]Anything sticking out of the ground, weird sloping things like that.
[90:31.85]You got it, sir.
[90:32.88]So you're looking to sell this for, uh, how... What?
[90:36.44]Just disable this.
[90:38.76]I never did like these cron stand systems.
[90:41.24]Or that pompous... So you're looking to sell this for, uh... How much was it again?
[90:45.20]1.1?
[90:45.22]Sounds about right.
[90:47.28]I suppose that's not under...
[90:49.06]No, don't turn it back on.
[90:50.92]You know what?
[90:51.76]Never mind.
[90:52.71]What?
[90:53.11]I don't think I want to buy this.
[90:55.33]Turn it on.
[91:01.91]Jameis awaits your attention.
[91:17.06]Wait, don't turn it back on.
[91:23.50]You know what?
[91:24.28]Ah, never mind.
[91:25.04]I don't care.
[91:26.09]I'm not gonna run.
[91:26.91]I'm just gonna accept my fate.
[91:36.19]Oh, computer, stop it.
[91:46.29]Never mind.
[91:46.95]I don't want to buy this place.
[91:49.96]Ugh.
[91:59.74]Alright.
[92:01.48]Let's go... What else is there to do?
[92:04.55]An Apple a day story mission did it.
[92:08.93]No smoking.
[92:11.31]We did... We kind of started that one.
[92:14.96]Let's try this one.
[92:18.53]Do the dad living in the walls bit.
[92:20.29]What happened with the elusive target?
[92:30.66]Did it first try in less than two minutes.
[92:36.30]Not a lie.
[92:37.84]I didn't make that up.
[92:46.87]Why does she hear that all the way?
[92:48.60]No way you hear that all the way out here.
[92:54.88]Alright, cigarettes.
[92:56.20]I'll take them.
[92:57.08]They're back here.
[92:57.72]I can't get back there.
[93:01.62]I have to climb over this.
[93:05.49]Climb through here.
[93:06.37]This is where the treehouse is.
[93:07.57]I'm gonna save it.
[93:10.41]You can hear it through the whole house?
[93:13.27]That's the point of a doorbell?
[93:14.87]My doorbell is really silent.
[93:26.09]What the fuck?
[93:27.97]Blend in as a gardener.
[93:34.17]What is in here?
[93:39.03]Hold on.
[93:39.37]I'm just exploring a little.
[93:40.62]I'm just curious.
[93:43.66]We got a basement.
[93:44.46]Wait.
[93:44.56]Oh.
[93:56.24]Right.
[93:56.70]Okay.
[93:57.48]Okay.
[94:16.68]Nothing over here that I need.
[94:17.70]I need to try to sneak through here.
[94:21.04]I can't unlock this shit.
[94:25.39]From this way, I can't even go over there.
[94:27.51]I gotta go all the way around.
[94:28.57]Oh my goodness.
[94:40.08]I'm sorry.
[94:47.75]The guy was doing the T-pose.
[94:49.17]I had to get... That guy was broken.
[94:53.69]Okay.
[95:25.30]Alright, I'm gonna have a golf club, so... What?
[95:33.83]I wanna use the golf club.
[95:34.95]I can't do that, apparently?
[95:47.07]Wait.
[95:48.07]That's not an ordinary resident of Whittleton Creek, 47.
[95:51.51]What?
[95:51.75]This must be one of Cassidy's men working undercover.
[95:54.79]I suggest you keep an eye out for more of them.
[95:58.98]Okay.
[95:59.72]Uh, shovel.
[96:01.04]Anything else?
[96:06.14]Alright, smoking kills.
[96:11.75]Use the rake.
[96:19.02]Uh, I can't grab the rake.
[96:20.08]Where's there a rake?
[96:23.14]Golf club, shovel.
[96:24.40]Where's there a rake?
[96:38.49]You can just let people walk into the rake.
[96:40.69]Ah, yeah, I've seen that.
[96:41.61]I have seen it.
[96:44.19]Uh, well...
[96:47.38]I'm just going to move out of here.
[96:51.40]The rake.
[96:57.52]Alright.
[96:58.66]I need smoking kills, so I have the cigarettes.
[97:04.23]I could give him weed, too, couldn't I?
[97:05.91]Give him some marijuana.
[97:06.81]The game's going to trap you until you find the rake.
[97:12.69]I just don't bring it with me.
[97:20.04]I need to poison these, don't I?
[97:21.72]Did I lose this opportunity?
[97:31.34]I think I may have lost this opportunity.
[97:38.28]Oh, there we go.
[97:38.72]One of Janice's guards... As Brantley talks to cigarettes over the fence and into the backyard, Janice is using an oxygen apparatus to help him breathe better, and the guard is trying to keep Janice alive.
[97:46.08]Okay.
[97:46.82]So I just go up there and let him smoke the cigarette?
[97:49.30]So, just go in the house and have him smoke.
[97:50.81]Okay.
[97:51.05]Uh, so where is that old man?
[97:52.61]There he is.
[97:52.95]Okay.
[98:08.94]These guys are gonna let me in, right?
[98:16.74]Really?
[98:18.78]Okay.
[98:23.01]Oh, fine.
[98:23.39]I'm going through a fucking window.
[98:33.69]Don't load the game.
[98:35.51]Save the game.
[98:46.86]Alright, let's see.
[98:54.45]Who's the closest person?
[98:55.67]Should I, like, lie down?
[98:59.99]Perform health check.
[99:08.89]Alright, where's that guy going?
[99:09.69]I need to take that guy's disguise.
[99:10.81]There he goes.
[99:13.67]You coming in here?
[99:20.31]Shit.
[99:22.82]I gotta go around him.
[99:24.14]Or you need to come in here.
[99:31.46]Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[99:34.09]Quickly, quickly.
[99:34.75]Come on, come on, come on.
[99:46.12]Excellent.
[99:47.74]Pick up the Uzi.
[99:49.08]Hide it.
[99:50.43]Okay.
[99:51.53]Time to give him his cigarettes.
[99:55.27]You guys can all see through my disguise.
[99:56.80]It's kind of annoying.
[100:13.19]Say, Gunther, did you see my photograph?
[100:16.71]The group photo from the first gathering?
[100:20.09]Janus is looking for an old group photo.
[100:23.03]It might be interesting to see who's on it.
[100:25.36]No, I need cigarettes.
[100:29.98]Turn on the cigarettes.
[100:32.24]How do I, like, put plant cigarettes over here so he smokes them?
[100:35.41]Here we go.
[100:38.35]Rig the oxygen tank.
[100:43.99]Alright, and then hide in the closet.
[100:45.27]Good work, 47.
[100:46.99]All there is left to do now is wait.
[100:53.59]I did it!
[100:57.67]I just read the game FAQ?
[100:59.91]No.
[101:05.42]Yes!
[101:11.10]I'm gonna be in here- look at how far away he is.
[101:12.54]I'm gonna be here for a long time.
[101:22.73]Save?
[101:22.95]I got an auto-save.
[101:23.97]I'm good.
[101:32.52]Can I hide under the bed?
[101:33.62]Or somewhere that I can see better?
[101:34.70]Alright, here he comes.
[101:46.27]Let's get a save here.
[101:54.57]You coming upstairs?
[101:58.33]No, is he actually... He's not going to go out and look at the molehills, right?
[102:04.98]Do the grandpa voice?
[102:05.98]Oh, okay.
[102:07.10]Fucking stupid.
[102:09.18]I hate this place and I hate all of you idiots.
[102:12.70]Taking away my cigarettes.
[102:14.42]That's the last fucking straw.
[102:23.95]He's doing it.
[102:24.53]He's doing the voice.
[102:25.45]He's doing it.
[102:29.93]So, funny story.
[102:30.65]I was at the grocery store.
[102:33.73]And they got so many pastas there.
[102:35.10]How are you supposed to pick up your favorite pasta?
[102:36.96]I almost just fell backwards in my chair and, like, hurt myself.
[102:51.66]That's pretty fucking crazy.
[102:53.63]I would have caused damage.
[103:00.85]Where's this old fucking man?
[103:02.33]Might as well just get out and hang out in here.
[103:03.89]Sit in his chair.
[103:09.22]I was gonna breathe in his oxygen.
[103:21.58]You coming?
[103:34.76]You old fucking man.
[103:37.10]Hurry up and get up here.
[103:40.84]Turn on the radio, but... Pee in his bed.
[104:07.28]I'm being patient.
[104:08.28]I am being very patient.
[104:11.76]I'm playing this correct.
[104:13.10]We're just hanging out.
[104:13.90]We're playing it right.
[104:17.44]Bro, you are so fucked.
[104:21.06]Am I though?
[104:21.52]I don't think so.
[104:31.99]You haven't lived or you peed in another man's bed?
[104:37.92]How would they know it was me?
[104:42.00]If I peed in... Okay, here we go.
[104:46.99]He'd probably think it was a cat or a dog or something.
[104:50.23]This is it.
[104:50.59]This is the climax.
[104:54.31]I'm ready for it.
[104:59.71]Fresh cigarettes.
[105:01.89]Rigged up oxygen tank.
[105:07.40]What's he doing?
[105:10.92]Just sit in that chair.
[105:14.97]Uh-huh.
[105:16.01]Almost.
[105:17.61]Almost.
[105:19.55]He's almost there.
[105:21.15]That's a helicopter.
[105:23.22]Okay, he's there.
[105:25.44]Ah, I think I'll have a pack of fresh cigarettes.
[105:42.80]What?
[105:43.54]Whoa.
[105:43.70]Oh.
[105:43.76]What?
[105:44.02]That was quick.
[105:44.82]That was really quick.
[105:47.26]Hold on.
[105:48.26]Wait.
[105:48.56]Is that a camera up there going to be there?
[105:50.46]I want to see something.
[106:13.50]If that camera is up there, I want to try something.
[106:28.12]So, wait till it gets right here.
[106:31.26]Joke incoming.
[106:33.57]Um, no, not really.
[106:35.59]More like I want to see if the angle shows me do this.
[106:38.93]Which would be funny.
[106:46.57]Joke alert.
[106:47.73]Joke alert.
[106:48.59]Joke alert.
[106:55.31]So we're going to see the picture in picture up there.
[106:57.25]Come on.
[107:00.71]Let's see it.
[107:01.51]Picture in picture.
[107:03.29]I want to see it.
[107:04.41]Here we go.
[107:15.06]I think you can see it.
[107:15.72]The top left.
[107:16.12]Peek through the window.
[107:18.38]You can't.
[107:45.66]That wasn't a joke.
[107:46.96]I was just seeing what would happen.
[107:49.74]I want to see if the picture-in-picture turned off.
[107:58.81]I thought you could throw the baseball at him.
[108:00.63]Oh, fuck.
[108:01.43]You're right.
[108:01.87]I'm gonna get up and point-blank throw it at his face.
[108:12.82]This is point blank, throw it as hard as you can.
[108:16.42]Did that kill him?
[108:17.06]No, I'm done.
[108:47.49]As old Trotsky said, just as a lamb... At last, the actions of the first constant catch up with you.
[108:57.19]Death feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.
[109:00.15]I did that.
[109:01.65]Still.
[109:03.61]We are close now, gentlemen.
[109:05.45]Both targets are dead.
[109:09.34]Command, I'm in the bedroom and nothing is happening.
[109:12.68]Kind of like my weekend.
[109:15.55]Alright, that was fun.
[109:23.78]Anybody smiling in here?
[109:25.08]What do you mean, smiling?
[110:01.99]Fuck the brownies!
[110:25.19]Top 100.
[110:26.71]Oh, we're all the way back here.
[110:28.00]Don't replay the whole mission.
[110:33.02]He's checked out.
[110:35.93]This guy is totally checked the fuck out right now.
[110:50.63]As old Trotsky said, just as a lamp.
[110:56.03]I'm trying to throw them.
[111:04.47]Throw it off screen?
[111:06.89]Hold on.
[111:07.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[111:12.53]It's when he said, as old, like right here.
[111:28.77]Throw it at the camera.
[111:31.95]Alright, I'll throw it at the camera.
[111:39.20]That actually might be kind of funny, because then it would bounce off the wall.
[111:41.34]Alright, let's go try that.
[111:43.22]And then I'm going to upload a different mission.
[111:48.52]Don't give him any more ideas.
[111:49.86]Shit.
[111:54.00]Ah, hold on.
[111:54.80]I did it wrong.
[111:56.22]I have to kill him.
[112:13.68]Throw the joint?
[112:14.68]I gotta kill both these guys while the camera's on.
[112:16.93]I'm gonna throw it into the camera.
[112:20.23]Like, right now.
[112:20.75]Here we go.
[112:21.03]Okay, here we go.
[112:48.63]No!
[112:49.01]It turned off.
[112:56.76]Hold on.
[112:57.76]This is the last time and I'm gonna open up another mission because we're just fucking around at this point.
[113:05.04]The cameraman fucked it up.
[113:10.55]Gonna make this quick.
[113:18.15]I didn't do any... I didn't... Last fucking time.
[113:22.22]I promise this is the last time.
[113:54.98]No, it wasn't even fucking worth it.
[113:56.32]I almost just alt-tabbed and deleted the game.
[114:02.92]Alright, go back, go back, we're going out.
[114:31.10]Alright, let me go I think I broke everything Let's go here Out tab didn't even take the first step in doing that Let's go here quiet mode
[115:04.67]It's taking syringe.
[115:07.45]I thought Quiet Man was only supposed to be three hours.
[115:10.11]Yeah.
[115:12.14]Yeah, it was.
[115:18.22]Get in that dryer.
[115:19.14]Alright, what is it?
[115:21.28]I want to start at the chapel.
[115:31.17]Didn't last two hours.
[115:35.77]You know part of me thinks I'm gonna go back I'm gonna think I'm gonna go back and play quiet man again after this I think I'm gonna go back and beat it at the end What oh
[116:06.77]That didn't do anything.
[116:12.60]They're all trying to get out.
[116:14.66]They're all becoming one person.
[116:20.70]That is the most single file.
[116:22.14]Did these people just spawn in?
[116:35.96]Did I put anything in the briefcase?
[116:47.68]You need to try to put a mine there.
[116:51.86]Oh, whoops.
[116:57.83]Go... Go put a trap at that exit.
[117:04.86]Oh, god damn it.
[117:18.83]Chat plays Hitman 2.
[117:21.89]I wasn't allowed to be here, apparently.
[117:23.07]Hey, you.
[117:23.91]Hey, you.
[117:24.99]Hey, you.
[117:25.45]Hey, you.
[117:25.89]Hey, you.
[117:44.25]I got caught.
[117:58.12]That just backfired completely.
[118:01.96]Ugh.
[118:10.00]I can't really go down from here.
[118:11.20]I have to, like, sneak over there.
[118:12.56]Let me try this one more time.
[118:22.16]I got one person.
[118:24.50]Wait, what?
[118:26.57]What?
[118:29.21]What?
[118:29.71]That was fucking...
[118:46.58]That took so long to get there.
[118:59.07]Oh, this game is fucking ridiculous.
[119:07.47]I did not know I could throw it from this far away.
[119:09.73]What happens if I just throw the suitcase from right here?
[119:14.20]Can I like target somebody down there?
[119:19.65]No.
[119:27.79]This is not going to reach, so it's not even... Wait, hold on.
[119:32.20]I can lock onto somebody over there.
[119:36.28]Hold on a second.
[119:36.96]Did you hear that?
[119:37.84]That's weird.
[119:45.44]Hold on a second.
[119:53.31]Throw a coin.
[119:57.45]I'm so happy he found this out.
[120:00.07]Well, I mean, at this point, I'm just fucking dicking around, so... So, hold on.
[120:08.94]I'm currently on... Locked on to somebody down there.
[120:11.42]Can I go all the way across?
[120:12.56]Like, all the way that way?
[120:24.17]It's catching some- okay, hold on.
[120:34.58]Holy shit.
[120:41.77]Oh my- that's insane.
[120:46.89]I almost- hold on a minute.
[120:48.05]What if I scare everybody and then do it?
[120:55.08]Is it possible that I could scare everybody, throw it?
[121:07.42]Is it only the briefcase, or can I do it with this?
[121:10.12]Oh, man.
[121:11.02]Okay, hold on.
[121:11.76]Okay, here you go.
[121:21.99]Are we gonna run?
[121:32.05]Not yet.
[121:32.43]I need to scare everybody.
[121:42.59]Come on.
[121:44.21]Here we go.
[121:50.52]Where did it go?
[122:02.32]I gotta get this group to run.
[122:03.42]Now it's just a random person ducking.
[122:12.13]That guy was already on the ground.
