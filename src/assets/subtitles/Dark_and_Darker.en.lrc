[00:25.68]What's happening?
[00:26.58]How you doing?
[00:38.67]Yeah, supposed to be live tomorrow, but we're live today.
[00:42.68]Felt like it.
[00:48.00]Hope you're doing well.
[00:50.81]got a plan tonight uh I was gonna play Dark and Darker tomorrow but I saw everybody playing it and I got I got fomo and I didn't I was like okay it's out right now it's only gonna be up for like five or six days or something I was like I don't want to wait till tomorrow I want to play it right now
[01:17.36]I did play a handful of rounds just to get the controls, because there's not really a proper tutorial.
[01:25.06]I understand how the game works.
[01:27.22]And boy, oh boy, is this game easy.
[01:31.96]My goodness.
[01:33.84]I've won every match.
[01:35.16]I have a ton of cool stuff.
[01:36.95]It's actually very simple.
[01:38.41]It's probably the easiest game I've ever played in regards to difficulty.
[01:50.24]And by that I mean it's hard for me to get past the first two skeletons.
[01:59.37]And if I do that, I usually die in the next room.
[02:02.97]So yeah, it's gonna be fun.
[02:10.65]But I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[02:14.03]What is this game?
[02:15.05]What is this game?
[02:17.25]And then I decided to read the developer little manual that's here.
[02:25.90]And in that manual, it says that 90% of our internal testers died to the first monster.
[02:32.37]Okay.
[02:36.53]Now I don't feel so bad.
[02:39.07]I don't feel so bad now.
[02:44.84]that's just the way it is yeah how come you're so zesty I don't know why is the microphone so close to my face hold on there we go uh yeah and I know this game is about I I join a party don't do it alone
[03:07.59]But whatever.
[03:08.53]Maybe we will.
[03:09.31]Maybe eventually.
[03:10.41]I don't know.
[03:10.95]Let me just see if I like it first.
[03:12.39]Let me just see if I like it.
[03:13.39]Before I hit up a bunch of streamer friends or YouTubers or whatever.
[03:17.35]Or the people in the community or whatever.
[03:18.84]Let me just make sure I like it.
[03:29.32]Surprise stream?
[03:30.12]Yes. ...
[03:37.51]That was easy.
[03:40.53]Where's Gunu?
[03:45.19]Hey.
[03:46.89]Gunu?
[03:47.45]No.
[03:47.77]No, no, no, no.
[03:48.33]People haven't... People didn't potentially watch the VOD last night.
[03:51.07]I don't want to give any spoilers.
[03:56.97]Alright, so let's go.
[03:58.71]I'm just gonna go.
[03:59.35]I do have a question.
[04:02.92]And I know a lot of you... This is my first time playing this.
[04:05.86]I didn't participate in the alpha.
[04:07.64]The first two alphas, whatever they were.
[04:09.80]So I'm going to have a lot of questions.
[04:11.72]And I would like them to have them answered.
[04:13.94]If you could, please help me.
[04:17.34]Question number one.
[04:20.28]This new map.
[04:22.50]This Goblin Caves map.
[04:25.05]Put it in emote only?
[04:26.23]What?
[04:26.59]No, don't do that.
[04:27.35]I need help.
[04:29.44]Is this Goblin Caves map something I should be doing solo?
[04:34.81]Because when I went to it and I opened it, it looked like a ton of really hard monsters were just walking around.
[04:40.41]Yeah, because as of this update, I think, there's a solo only map.
[04:52.16]It's only solo, yeah.
[04:53.79]The Goblin Cave is so hard, yeah.
[05:01.06]It's really hard monsters?
[05:02.02]Yeah.
[05:06.77]It's so low, but way hard.
[05:08.40]Okay.
[05:10.86]right well let's just I'm just jumping in look and I look I people are going to give me a lot of help I'm sure there's going to be people that are trickling into this stream that like are going to ask hey I'm just like curious can can this guy tie his shoes or is this like a normal thing and I know I'm I'm ready to I'm prepared to look over and see so bad OMEGALUL and I'm gonna make sure it doesn't get to me I'm gonna look over I'm gonna see it probably every 10 seconds
[05:37.82]I know it.
[05:38.38]I'm in the mirror.
[05:39.40]I was doing nice, relaxed breathing.
[05:41.80]I was going, alright.
[05:44.31]You can do this.
[05:44.89]We're going to be good.
[05:53.99]Already bad.
[05:54.81]Alright.
[05:55.95]Are you guys ready?
[05:57.31]I've got my drink here.
[05:58.29]I'm ready to play some games.
[05:59.55]Let's go for it.
[06:00.03]Hope you're doing well.
[06:02.38]Don't make fun of me too much.
[06:03.84]I'm new.
[06:09.98]So, I'm just going to do the regular mode.
[06:12.38]I made a couple of characters.
[06:15.17]This is Mead 1.
[06:16.35]Not to be confused with Mead 3.
[06:20.39]Mead 4.
[06:21.39]Mead 5.
[06:23.71]Or Smush.
[06:25.13]I have Smush 1.
[06:25.73]Smush 3.
[06:26.29]Smush 7.
[06:26.63]Sorry, Smush Now.
[06:34.48]Where's Mead 2?
[06:35.04]Smush 2.
[06:41.37]Yeah, I skipped over two and I skipped over like five.
[06:46.26]I don't know who to play with.
[06:51.74]Barbarian seems dangerous.
[06:55.51]Fighter seems like the thing to start with.
[07:01.59]I'm going to start with Fighter.
[07:02.53]I'm going to start with... I got a shield.
[07:04.71]Shield.
[07:08.74]Is this a good stream to fall asleep to?
[07:10.60]Um, ask that again in 20 minutes after I've screamed for the first time.
[07:15.10]Probably, hopefully not that loud.
[07:19.50]Alright, I'm gonna stay with the fighter.
[07:21.18]This is just the default class.
[07:22.88]It's just the fighter.
[07:24.06]You can use most gear, you can do most things, and you have a sword and a shield.
[07:30.87]I'm just gonna go.
[07:32.19]I don't know why, I must have said hi at some point with the other character to nobody.
[07:35.27]Alright, let's go.
[07:36.93]Let's go.
[07:37.27]I'm going.
[07:39.93]Am I gonna get stream sniped?
[07:42.17]Oh, shit.
[07:42.77]I probably am.
[07:45.13]I'm gonna get stream sniped.
[07:50.04]Oh.
[07:56.40]It's open mic.
[07:57.24]I turned it off.
[07:58.62]I made sure to turn voice chat off.
[08:00.03]Don't worry.
[08:02.35]I put streamer mode on and I turned off voice chat.
[08:04.89]I don't know if that matters.
[08:13.16]Okay.
[08:14.14]Here we go.
[08:15.88]Both headphones going in.
[08:16.84]It's time for me to try this game out.
[08:20.90]Alright.
[08:29.01]It's time for me to try this game out.
[08:31.43]That was kind of E3, I will say.
[08:38.41]Okay, I already hear something.
[08:39.41]Hold on.
[08:54.72]Should I worry about people hearing my footprints?
[08:59.28]Pick it up.
[09:03.93]What the fuck is that?
[09:11.83]Jesus.
[09:21.56]Is it loud?
[09:22.18]It sounds kind of loud.
[09:31.08]Ooh, a gem.
[09:35.40]Does that mean anything?
[09:38.00]Is it good?
[09:38.32]Okay, good.
[09:48.00]There's a lot.
[09:48.38]Okay, so for those of you that don't know, this is a PvPvP-PvPvPe.
[09:58.85]Okay, I can't make any, I can't like talk.
[10:04.16]Is that a person?
[10:06.08]This is, that's a player.
[10:06.96]Is it a player?
[10:08.58]What the, what is that?
[10:09.30]Ow.
[10:10.40]Alright, so I'm dead.
[10:19.12]Alright, so I died.
[10:21.69]That's, um, it's a good test run.
[10:24.21]I'm dead.
[10:25.61]And I lost.
[10:27.35]It is kind of loud.
[10:30.16]It's too loud.
[10:31.67]Alright, that's game number one.
[10:33.39]I'm trying to think of what I might have done wrong there.
[10:40.53]There's too many people in that room and I messed up.
[10:45.49]Is this a VR game?
[10:49.59]How is the audio?
[10:51.23]Is it actually too soft?
[11:06.91]Like that.
[11:08.21]I wonder if that's better.
[11:09.41]Music can stay there.
[11:20.44]Alright.
[11:24.42]What did I do wrong?
[11:26.78]What did I do?
[11:27.24]I can't do facecam.
[11:27.92]I don't have any clothes on.
[11:29.52]I literally don't have a shirt on.
[11:30.76]I can't.
[11:32.68]I'm not doing that.
[11:42.37]So should I just wait and slowly walk around and open chests and stuff?
[11:55.20]Only engage one enemy at a time.
[11:57.16]I mean like this motherfucker right here.
[12:14.39]Alright, well there's two enemies now.
[12:19.21]What?
[12:19.45]That didn't block it?
[12:23.14]Excuse me, why is that not blocking?
[12:26.84]Hold on.
[12:27.22]Wait, what the fuck is that?
[12:29.95]What?
[12:31.79]This one doesn't count.
[12:33.13]That one doesn't count.
[12:33.79]Why did it not block?
[12:35.35]It went right through the fucking shield.
[12:44.18]It's loud.
[12:47.86]It's a timed block.
[12:55.92]Wait, it's timed.
[12:57.12]Wait, so I can't just hold it up?
[12:58.46]I have to like, oh, boom.
[13:00.32]Okay.
[13:01.12]I'm learning.
[13:03.62]Hey, the developers of the game couldn't even get past the first room.
[13:06.88]So, hey, easy.
[13:08.68]Easy.
[13:09.84]Easy.
[13:17.89]I'm not gonna uninstall the game.
[13:19.51]What are you talking about?
[13:21.45]I'm not gonna uninstall it.
[13:26.50]Yeah, well, I guess I'm gonna uninstall the game.
[13:28.62]That's enough.
[13:29.12]I've had enough.
[13:33.78]Oh my god.
[13:34.49]That probably hurt.
[13:36.45]That was my blood coming off of my hand.
[13:38.63]That was nothing to do with his head.
[13:46.11]Aim at the attack.
[13:49.47]I'll figure it out.
[14:02.37]Okay.
[14:05.12]No, I'm not uninstalling it.
[14:07.12]The only way you can get good is if you get good.
[14:11.64]Nowhere in the get good manual is it uninstall the game after 10 minutes.
[14:17.70]That's not get good.
[14:18.82]I thought that hurt me.
[14:28.80]Ooh.
[14:31.65]A ring.
[14:44.22]I'm not going that way.
[14:45.48]I'll deal with the spiders.
[14:51.04]One hit?
[14:51.94]Okay.
[14:59.22]Get the fuck over here.
[15:11.33]Can I break that?
[15:22.28]Okay, you can break it.
[15:23.11]Alright, alright, alright.
[15:30.93]Not bad.
[15:33.25]Okay, not bad.
[15:34.67]Not bad.
[15:35.26]Didn't take any damage.
[15:40.74]I gotta move here.
[15:45.56]Actually, I don't want to go this way.
[15:47.24]The thing's coming.
[15:48.61]Look at the mini-map.
[15:50.44]Should I cover the mini-map?
[15:52.86]Is that what streamers do?
[15:54.00]Because you know where I am.
[15:56.92]What is this?
[15:57.26]What's going on in this room?
[16:23.96]So it's a physics-based block.
[16:33.82]Alright, give me a fucking diamond.
[16:40.49]Give me some gems, some jewels.
[16:43.75]Thank you.
[16:44.23]Alright, how do I get out of here?
[16:46.91]I want to leave now.
[16:48.45]I got three gems and I'm done.
[16:50.50]I want to leave.
[16:51.14]How do I get out?
[16:55.59]How do I get out of here?
[17:04.52]You need to find a- I need to find a blo- Yeah, I forgot to find a portal.
[17:07.12]Where- where- where are they?
[17:21.49]Is there weight in this game?
[17:25.25]Okay, I gotta go over here.
[17:25.99]I gotta wrap around.
[17:28.26]I can't get this way.
[17:29.16]Head towards the middle.
[17:29.72]They only spawn near the end of the round.
[17:31.80]Okay.
[17:33.24]And the round is eight and a half minutes left.
[17:36.08]From what I understand.
[17:36.80]You're looking at that, right?
[17:47.59]Watch out.
[18:10.42]I gotta go.
[18:12.73]I gotta go!
[18:19.83]I gotta go!
[18:20.25]How do I get through this?
[18:23.03]Can I open this?
[18:23.55]Fuck!
[18:27.01]I gotta go now!
[18:27.67]Is there a lever?
[18:38.05]I don't- I don't see one.
[18:39.22]I don't see one.
[18:42.01]Is there one on the wall?
[18:43.15]I don't see... I'm just gonna go this way.
[18:44.74]Oh shit, I'm dead.
[18:47.64]Other side of the door.
[18:49.76]Uh, hold on.
[18:57.40]I got kinda screwed here.
[19:09.76]This is... I got screwed.
[19:17.09]What happened?
[19:18.13]What?
[19:21.89]Where the fuck did all these people come from?
[19:23.53]I got screwed.
[19:24.39]I got screwed.
[19:32.50]That's what happened.
[19:36.02]I couldn't leave and the thing... I got screwed.
[19:53.86]Is this harder than Elden Ring?
[19:55.96]Um, I don't know.
[19:57.06]Maybe.
[20:02.10]It was a stone by one of the doors.
[20:06.14]I'm getting it, though.
[20:06.72]I'm understanding it.
[20:09.50]Yeah, the game is meant to be very difficult by design.
[20:14.44]Well, I kind of, that was kind of a bad spawn.
[20:17.84]I got trapped behind that wall with the lever and I didn't, it was on the other side.
[20:22.68]Best to play it in a team.
[20:23.96]Well, I would like to get to a point where I see another player first.
[20:28.04]Alright, let's go.
[20:28.92]I get it.
[20:30.22]This looks like a much better spawn.
[20:42.14]Am I poisoned?
[20:44.08]I'm already poisoned.
[20:46.24]Shit, come on, man.
[20:55.75]Oh, shit.
[20:56.19]Okay, hold on.
[20:57.35]Two movement speed?
[20:58.31]This is pretty good.
[20:59.29]Okay.
[21:07.16]Actually, I am a little faster.
[21:08.08]Alright, alright, alright.
[21:15.28]Campfire kit.
[21:16.02]I know this heals.
[21:41.19]Somebody's shooting.
[21:41.65]Make sure to close the doors behind you.
[21:49.23]Yeah, that's true.
[22:07.64]What have you done?
[22:08.16]Why'd you aggro everybody?
[22:09.34]Oh, what have you done?
[22:10.58]What have I done?
[22:11.95]What have you done?
[22:17.84]I got him!
[22:19.28]How do I heal?
[22:40.34]You!
[22:43.58]Ah!
[22:44.76]Oh!
[22:45.98]Oh!
[22:47.56]Jesus.
[22:48.86]You can't get in here.
[22:49.62]I'm gonna heal in here.
[22:55.00]Uh-heh-heh.
[23:06.53]Uh-heh-heh.
[23:09.86]Alright, I feel pretty good about that.
[23:11.14]Alright, so... Can rogues go invisible?
[23:23.23]Happened?
[23:23.57]Oh, I'm okay.
[23:24.41]Oh, it's only like a half heal.
[23:25.47]Alright, I got a kill.
[23:27.39]I'm happy about that.
[23:28.93]I gotta go loot that body.
[23:30.91]Your E is a heal.
[23:33.55]Um... It is... Oh my god!
[23:40.22]I thought it was like a power-up.
[23:41.32]Alright, where'd that guy die?
[23:51.29]Oh my-
[24:14.90]Shit.
[24:15.76]What is this?
[24:16.92]A sacrificial altar?
[24:19.68]Oh, okay.
[24:20.70]I'm fucking out of here.
[24:21.92]I'm out of here.
[24:23.28]I feel like the whole instance aggravated me.
[24:31.56]Okay.
[24:32.00]What was that?
[24:51.41]How do I throw this?
[24:55.09]Oh.
[25:10.40]Oh shit.
[25:12.60]A portal appeared?
[25:13.24]Did they show up on the mini-map or no?
[25:24.77]What the hell?
[25:27.13]How do I equip that?
[25:30.14]Alright, I'm kind of safe here.
[25:42.17]Wait.
[26:01.93]It's like three.
[26:02.65]They're friends.
[26:03.62]They're friends.
[26:05.27]I ain't going over there.
[26:31.41]Three of them.
[26:32.23]It's three people.
[26:33.87]It's three people.
[26:42.09]I killed somebody?
[27:06.72]Holy shit, there's an omega chest!
[27:11.10]Guys, there's an omega chest right here.
[27:14.00]What?
[27:14.80]Oh, I can't... How do I get out of here?
[27:21.57]I need to leave now.
[27:34.71]I'm safe right here.
[27:38.97]Oh my god.
[27:40.33]Oh my god.
[27:41.06]Oh my god.
[27:41.44]This is so much.
[27:41.94]I can take everything.
[27:44.06]Oh my god.
[27:44.46]Look at all this gear.
[27:45.38]This stuff doesn't look good.
[27:46.64]Does anybody have anything?
[27:48.54]What a battle that came.
[27:49.70]Look at this battle that happened here.
[27:53.41]This stuff, it's all just default shit.
[28:13.50]This guy's going over.
[28:14.14]Oh, that's like a whole party.
[28:20.79]That's a whole party.
[28:21.89]That's an entire party.
[28:26.20]I got nowhere to run.
[28:40.89]Use your invisibility potion?
[28:42.61]How do I switch to it?
[28:43.57]How do I switch to it?
[28:44.17]How do I switch to it?
[28:44.75]How do I switch to it?
[28:45.32]How do I switch to it?
[28:45.90]How do I switch to it?
[28:46.48]How do I switch to it?
[28:46.92]What button?
[28:47.76]Tell me.
[28:48.46]Quick.
[28:49.02]Quick, quick, quickly.
[28:49.68]Quick.
[28:50.12]Four.
[28:50.62]Quickly.
[29:50.66]I'm invisible.
[29:51.58]Fuck you.
[29:52.82]I'm invisible.
[29:55.00]He can see me.
[29:55.68]Why can he see me?
[29:56.28]What's going on?
[30:13.55]Shit, that hurt.
[30:14.58]Who?
[30:14.94]From where?
[30:15.32]From behind?
[30:15.82]What are you talking about?
[30:22.58]Oh, my God.
[30:23.30]What did I do?
[30:23.96]What happened?
[30:24.66]Who killed me?
[30:25.28]What's going on?
[30:30.40]What was that?
[30:31.02]Press E?
[30:32.70]What?
[30:36.83]It was a wall trap?
[30:39.09]Oh.
[30:41.01]I got to fight against three people?
[30:45.25]E is your... Oh, no.
[30:47.03]I rebounded.
[30:47.60]That's why.
[30:54.67]Where are all the portals?
[30:57.19]That was like at the very end.
[30:58.25]There was only one little circle.
[31:02.13]That was okay.
[31:02.71]That was better.
[31:03.29]That was a pretty crazy three-piece.
[31:09.94]Was it?
[31:10.50]Do you mean that?
[31:14.16]He played well.
[31:15.74]Alright, nice.
[31:17.42]Cool.
[31:20.20]Oh my god, that feels like pretty good.
[31:25.83]He's blushing.
[31:26.66]Okay.
[31:37.02]Well, I have to apologize that all of you are about to completely rescind those statements when I die to another trap in about 15 seconds right now.
[32:00.13]I'm gonna die.
[32:03.97]Alright, gimme some.
[32:32.41]So, are these, like, Diablo II kind of style?
[32:35.31]Do I put these in stuff, or is it just... Do you just sell them?
[32:39.91]Very interested.
[32:47.09]What the fuck is that?
[32:51.83]Ow!
[32:54.51]Ow!
[32:56.25]Ow!
[33:01.86]I'm dead.
[33:04.91]Run, run, run, run.
[33:07.07]Oh, okay.
[33:07.85]I keep forgetting about the heal.
[33:12.79]Turn the volume down more.
[33:14.33]Okay, hold on.
[33:19.58]Oh, it didn't even... I thought I did it.
[33:20.94]There we go.
[33:23.06]You can change your abilities.
[33:32.90]I gotta get out.
[33:34.10]I gotta get out once.
[33:38.73]I have to at least escape one time with at least something.
[33:43.89]It resets every game.
[33:46.75]Oh, does it?
[33:54.82]Yeah, I have the streamer mode on.
[34:05.21]If it's resetting the audio, I'll just do it through OBS.
[34:07.17]I'll do it right now.
[34:11.25]Just dropped it a little.
[34:21.80]How's that?
[34:22.24]Is that better?
[34:23.32]Okay, that's, this is, I'm in like a library.
[34:29.75]Alright, hold on.
[34:39.01]Okay, that really hurt.
[34:58.30]Okay, what do you have?
[35:01.72]Anything?
[35:10.36]What's a quick way to scroll between the items you have in your three and four slot?
[35:17.96]They added solos.
[35:19.02]It seemed like the solo was harder.
[35:20.82]Like the enemies were harder.
[35:23.16]It was like five or six enemies in each room and it seemed kind of overwhelming.
[35:27.13]You press them multiple times.
[35:28.59]Oh, right.
[35:28.95]It doesn't just rank it.
[35:29.69]Okay.
[35:42.98]Get out of here.
[35:51.27]Okay.
[35:52.35]Whoa!
[36:06.85]Free stuff!
[36:10.91]It's a friend.
[36:11.37]Okay.
[36:11.79]Alright, let's work together.
[36:17.62]What about this person?
[36:19.43]Never mind, run.
[36:19.95]Run.
[36:23.27]They're all decked out.
[36:24.17]They have like... Look at that.
[36:25.03]They have uniques.
[36:26.12]They have like fucking purples.
[36:28.16]No, you know what?
[36:28.72]Fuck it.
[36:28.98]Let's get them right now.
[36:29.66]They're gonna think we're scared.
[36:50.97]We were two squires.
[36:53.01]Two rogue squires.
[36:55.65]Going up against the greatest knight in the kingdom.
[36:57.99]What the fuck was I thinking?
[37:01.86]You just got your friend killed.
[37:03.54]Oh, it's alright.
[37:07.06]Heal.
[37:07.54]I gotta burn that into my brain.
[37:09.20]Okay.
[37:19.84]We were just like two farm workers, two farm boys.
[37:33.43]Podricks.
[37:37.19]You were trash mobs.
[37:38.96]Yeah.
[37:54.25]Okay, this is, this is, I'm gonna get out of this one.
[37:56.07]I'm gonna get out of here.
[37:59.95]Look at all, look at this room.
[38:01.29]This is the room to spawn in.
[38:02.63]There's tons of shit here.
[38:03.57]Alright, what do you got?
[38:17.02]Gold coins.
[38:31.79]22.
[38:32.01]Oh, shit.
[38:36.55]Is it better?
[38:48.66]Nice.
[38:48.88]I should probably just throw this shit away.
[38:53.06]No, I'm going to put it in here.
[38:53.80]I'm going to make somebody's day really bad.
[39:00.35]What's that?
[39:00.63]23, 22.
[39:00.67]Movement speed, movement speed.
[39:13.20]Armor, armor pen.
[39:20.86]What?
[39:33.37]That's kind of cool.
[39:36.29]Should I do that?
[39:36.80]I feel like that's dangerous.
[39:37.70]I don't think I have the skill to do that right now.
[39:45.34]Wait, what?
[39:47.88]It's an offhanded weapon?
[39:49.20]Is it an offhanded weapon?
[39:50.96]This is weird.
[39:59.65]What's that?
[39:59.91]What's going on here?
[40:01.61]Is it only an offhand?
[40:07.10]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[40:10.96]Fuck.
[40:11.44]That was stupid.
[40:13.04]Alright, easy.
[40:34.86]Actually kind of cool.
[40:35.76]Alright, give me another one.
[40:44.05]Yeah, do a welding.
[40:48.01]I gotta start to move.
[40:54.34]Oh, hell yeah.
[40:57.68]Okay, I've got shit on now.
[41:00.84]I just have to get out of here.
[41:22.15]How come it doesn't swing both sometimes?
[41:26.45]Crystal ball.
[41:27.85]Gauntlets.
[41:31.73]Swing.
[41:32.11]Oh, I have to swing this and then this.
[41:34.99]I can't do it the other way.
[41:35.83]Okay.
[41:37.75]Heal.
[41:38.22]Yep.
[41:38.62]Thank you.
[41:39.02]Appreciate it.
[41:39.64]Alright, I gotta move.
[41:51.87]Looks like a way to go this way.
[41:55.50]Can I go that way?
[41:57.30]Yeah, how do I get?
[41:57.94]There's like a tunnel or something.
[42:04.10]Oh shit, nice.
[42:22.75]Holy shit, I lucked out another one of these rooms.
[42:25.71]Ow.
[42:26.05]Okay, don't.
[42:26.77]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[42:27.65]I'm freaking out.
[42:28.33]I gotta stop freaking out.
[42:38.10]Oh, fuck off.
[42:45.52]It's so easy to be greedy.
[42:52.22]Do I have a stamina bar?
[42:53.60]That's a great question.
[43:02.62]No, okay.
[43:09.59]I think I got another second or two.
[43:12.35]I need a health potion or something.
[43:13.55]Shit.
[43:20.83]I don't
[43:28.03]Fuck, I have too much stuff.
[43:56.02]Oh come on, I should've hit.
[44:22.35]I gotta dump some of this junk.
[44:27.14]Ooh.
[44:28.70]Um.
[44:29.84]What is this thing?
[44:30.74]Horseman's axe.
[44:44.73]Somebody's been here.
[45:05.53]Money?
[45:05.79]Alright, let me get... Give me a portal.
[45:09.49]Get me out of here.
[45:10.35]I need a portal.
[45:11.09]Come on.
[45:12.01]What do they look like?
[45:12.89]Is it very obvious?
[45:17.66]What?
[45:18.98]Somebody's coming.
[45:19.92]There's a hat.
[45:24.14]Uh... Um...
[45:36.03]I can't just put it on.
[45:46.54]I can't put it on.
[45:47.18]Dude, you're a walking loot box.
[46:01.06]I know.
[46:01.46]That's why I'm so nervous.
[46:02.78]I just want to leave.
[46:13.85]Point and click adventure game protagonist.
[46:17.30]That's not, come on.
[46:21.72]Somebody coming?
[46:27.40]Give me more money.
[46:38.26]Fuck, okay.
[46:42.70]No, no!
[46:46.67]Oh, I can get out.
[46:49.35]Should I just stay in here?
[46:51.69]I'm just gonna sit in here.
[47:00.13]Just camp.
[47:01.51]Just hide.
[47:02.29]Heal.
[47:03.41]I don't have a heal left.
[47:04.33]I used it already.
[47:06.11]Turn the torches off.
[47:11.80]Well, no, this shit is closing in.
[47:13.14]I have to leave.
[47:22.09]I think somebody just came in here.
[47:26.64]Get... Okay, give me a fucking portal.
[47:29.46]Give me...
[47:57.38]What the fuck did I just do?
[47:58.70]No, drink it!
[47:59.96]Drink it.
[48:01.58]How do I drink it?
[48:04.03]What?
[48:04.31]Why am I using it as a weapon?
[48:05.79]How do I use it?
[48:08.43]What's going on?
[48:19.72]Oh!
[48:21.61]What the hell is that thing?
[48:22.55]Oh!
[48:25.90]Oh my goodness!
[48:29.96]No!
[48:31.40]No!
[48:31.90]Oh shit.
[48:37.10]Oh shit.
[48:40.14]Oh shit.
[48:42.00]I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it.
[48:47.41]I couldn't do it.
[48:48.25]It was too long.
[48:49.05]At least they were alright behind me.
[48:52.86]Oh, that's so sad.
[48:54.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[48:58.20]Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it.
[49:01.79]I'm dead.
[49:13.59]God damn it.
[49:16.06]Should have just done it.
[49:17.08]I didn't know how it worked.
[49:20.03]That's the first time I've ever seen one.
[49:22.57]In my brain, I don't know why, I figured it was like press E and you just go in.
[49:28.11]I didn't know it was like for like 15 seconds.
[49:33.22]God damn it.
[49:43.66]That wizard was in the same position.
[49:45.01]Did the wizard get out?
[49:46.59]Did I let that wizard get out?
[49:49.03]That's what happened.
[49:51.85]Oh, man.
[49:52.63]I took all the aggro away from the wizard.
[49:55.11]Oh, he died.
[49:55.55]Okay.
[49:55.91]I don't feel as bad anymore.
[49:59.19]That was so close, too.
[50:02.31]I didn't know.
[50:03.09]I thought you could just go into it.
[50:05.15]I didn't know you had to sit there and open it like a treasure chest.
[50:12.77]The wizard was helping you?
[50:15.36]It's one portal per person.
[50:21.53]They're a one-time use.
[50:25.87]Oh.
[50:27.33]So... You want to be first to the center.
[50:33.72]That's one of the reasons why.
[50:34.80]Shit.
[50:43.13]God damn it.
[50:45.33]Oh, all my stuff that I got.
[50:51.47]Alright, I'm going to the center right now.
[50:54.18]I'm just trying to get there immediately.
[50:56.12]After I touch this.
[50:58.88]Never mind.
[51:13.06]Oh my god, stop!
[51:31.74]uh yeah this is the demo so this is available right now if you want to try it if you want to play it it's a free demo oh you're behind okay it's not like a beta sign up or anything it's just you can just do it it's good okay no I need to get to the center even if I leave here with one health potion I don't care
[53:25.99]Always take out the healer first, that's what you taught me.
[53:56.65]Something's wrong.
[53:57.65]Something's wrong.
[53:58.49]God damn it.
[54:02.89]2v1.
[54:03.03]Fuck.
[54:12.58]Your sword's too short.
[54:24.23]Alright.
[54:25.82]So I have two things to ask.
[54:28.74]Was that a healer?
[54:30.20]Or am I just wrong?
[54:33.82]Chain your attacks together?
[54:34.90]I mean, well, there's somebody behind you and somebody in front of you.
[54:39.64]I'm just getting fucking beat up.
[54:41.60]That was a cleric.
[54:43.17]Okay.
[54:44.85]So the cleric, that green beam was a heal.
[54:50.49]How good is it?
[54:58.62]It's good.
[54:59.30]Okay.
[55:00.54]I was, I didn't, you know, I was thinking like this game is kind of a hard game and like, oh, I'm a healer.
[55:05.95]I feel like it would be like a shitty heal, but it's good.
[55:09.25]It's really good.
[55:10.03]Okay.
[55:11.33]Okay.
[55:12.83]It's 35 on others, 15 on self.
[55:14.21]It's pretty good.
[55:14.71]Okay.
[55:16.75]Okay.
[55:26.65]It's a sprint and second wind.
[55:28.99]Adrenaline, ooh.
[55:38.36]Why is everybody saying I was like BMing?
[55:41.58]Because I ran up and started attacking him?
[55:46.28]All I'm saying is, I walked in that room.
[55:50.10]I walked in that room.
[55:51.69]And I don't know what the moves are.
[55:55.09]That caster looked at me.
[55:57.11]And then I saw him casting a spell.
[56:00.19]And I'm just like, okay, this is an aggressive spell.
[56:02.33]It was green.
[56:03.19]I thought it was a poison spell.
[56:04.65]I thought he was casting a poison spell at me.
[56:07.84]Some people are friendly.
[56:09.02]So I was just like the crazy guy.
[56:11.98]Okay.
[56:22.76]There was even an opportunity for me to leave.
[56:25.38]And I just like chugged a bunch of heels, ran back in swinging.
[56:30.28]Okay.
[56:33.10]Yeah.
[56:33.52]But I don't know.
[56:34.42]In a game like this, you don't expect anybody to be friendly.
[56:41.72]Is this a taunt?
[56:45.44]That's kind of good.
[56:52.07]I feel like I need to use these more often.
[56:53.97]I'll be fine though.
[56:55.83]Yeah, PvP is the point of the game.
[56:57.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:57.97]Yeah, that's true.
[57:03.56]It's like, oh, this guy is attacking us.
[57:06.36]We're just trying to loot.
[57:07.44]Oh, dude.
[57:07.88]Alright, he left.
[57:09.75]What's that I hear?
[57:11.75]He's just... Okay, I hear him doing a bunch of drugs in the other room.
[57:15.27]And then he screamed real loud and came outside.
[57:28.26]Okay, cool.
[57:31.31]You need to spam crouch to say you're friendly.
[57:34.43]There's, yeah, there's VoIP.
[57:37.09]Yeah, but I don't want to use it.
[57:40.67]I like silent protagonists.
[57:44.62]What if the whole time they were like, dude, bro, stop, chill.
[57:47.40]What are you doing?
[57:48.36]Come on, stop, man.
[57:49.62]Can you hear us?
[57:50.20]I don't hear anything.
[57:51.68]I just have all of my ears are closed.
[57:53.36]I'm just going to kill people.
[57:57.11]You're a rabid animal.
[58:02.19]Bro, please.
[58:02.89]Dude, I'll heal you.
[58:03.79]Just stop.
[58:14.96]Oh, I got poisoned.
[58:15.96]It's alright.
[58:30.48]That poison kind of hurts.
[58:40.75]Nothing.
[58:48.31]Oh there's a tomb.
[59:16.76]Fuck.
[59:17.84]Let's use it.
[59:19.91]Kind of sloppy right now.
[59:52.47]Ooh, alright.
[59:53.39]I can definitely, I can definitely, I can definitely trade this.
[60:02.52]This is some good shit.
[60:03.32]I can't lose this.
[60:03.90]I have 22 max health.
[60:07.54]Do a welding again.
[60:10.16]Let's go.
[60:24.81]Nice.
[60:27.98]What is this thing?
[60:29.48]Can I touch this?
[60:30.02]It's not going to spit like acid at me or anything, right?
[60:35.00]Okay, I'm going to move.
[60:37.93]I hear somebody.
[60:49.18]Somebody to the left.
[60:58.55]That's multiple feet.
[61:00.85]That's multiple feet.
[61:01.55]I gotta get out of here.
[61:03.41]That's multiple feet.
[61:09.92]Ah!
[61:10.86]What?
[61:11.32]Oh my god!
[61:12.24]I didn't even... I didn't even realize...
[61:29.75]You're bullshit.
[61:32.03]Oh, my God!
[61:33.61]That was a bad start.
[61:42.50]I got kind of, you know, whatever.
[61:44.52]There was a secret entrance, too.
[61:54.60]He's getting worse.
[61:57.50]Um, I don't know if I'm getting worse.
[61:59.98]I'm just kind of getting bad starts.
[62:11.26]Can you roleplay as the silent protagonist this round?
[62:13.61]Yeah, sure.
[62:14.77]That sounds fun.
[62:38.35]I will defend.
[62:39.02]Oh, I'm supposed to be silent.
[63:17.49]Oh my god, stop it this Oh what another shit start
[63:46.99]OK.
[63:51.53]I even saw you too.
[63:52.77]I saw you.
[63:53.81]I knew exactly what was going on over here.
[63:55.21]You're not making this any easier.
[64:25.52]The sword is made out of styrofoam.
[64:29.83]All it is is just bad for the environment.
[64:31.63]It doesn't even do anything else.
[64:39.67]Oh my god.
[64:40.43]This is fucking awful.
[64:42.89]Like, can I- is it- are we alright now?
[64:46.05]Can I- can I get some stuff?
[64:54.79]This thing is cracked.
[64:55.55]What does that mean?
[65:09.78]Somebody's walking.
[65:41.37]Your feet make penguin slap sounds.
[65:49.13]Not anymore.
[65:50.53]I got shoes on now.
[65:55.90]Oh my god!
[65:57.28]Fucking Dark and Darker, dude.
[66:15.13]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[66:17.76]Wait, look at the bullshit in here.
[66:22.92]Okay.
[66:40.78]Oh my god, I died to the seal.
[66:42.64]Okay, everybody relax.
[66:44.48]It's Daka and Daka.
[66:45.50]It's fucking hard.
[66:46.70]And you gotta relax because you just have to be aware of your surroundings.
[66:51.93]And... I feel like an orc.
[66:56.19]And Orcs Must Die.
[66:57.13]I just gotta... Whatever.
[66:59.69]It's alright.
[67:00.31]It's alright.
[67:00.97]Oh, and I was doing pretty good there.
[67:03.33]No, that was not good.
[67:04.79]I'm just going again.
[67:08.18]Ugh.
[67:17.93]Ow, my hand.
[67:36.26]Stream snipers don't even have a chance.
[67:38.58]No, they kind of don't.
[67:44.22]I'm probably pissing off the stream snipers right now.
[67:46.70]Because they're spending all this time desperately trying to get over to where I am.
[67:50.34]And they're spending like 15 to 20 minutes sometimes getting precisely to where I am.
[67:55.37]And I just die in the first five minutes.
[67:56.83]And they're just like, what the fuck?
[67:57.83]Maybe that's a deterrent to stream snipers.
[68:00.29]Interesting.
[68:00.67]Alright.
[68:06.17]This is a good room.
[68:09.12]Just watch out for that in the middle.
[68:37.09]What is that sound?
[68:39.03]What was that?
[68:44.77]What was that?
[68:51.28]Nice.
[68:52.44]Green boots.
[68:54.14]Plus one strength.
[68:58.40]Candy?
[69:03.26]Oil lantern?
[69:08.30]Okay.
[69:08.92]That slows me down.
[69:09.74]I don't know if I like that.
[69:17.80]Holy shit.
[69:20.42]Okay, I gotta leave now.
[69:21.08]I just got a blue sword.
[69:23.68]Uh... Okay, get- look at all that shit over there.
[69:32.69]Oh my goodness.
[69:51.74]There's so much stuff over there too.
[69:53.24]How many fucking arrows can you shoot in a row?
[70:10.12]I'm so dead.
[70:28.66]What?
[70:30.12]What the fuck?
[70:33.62]He does that sometimes?
[70:40.07]He didn't shoot two in a row the last time.
[71:00.15]It's a rabid animal.
[71:08.01]Okay.
[71:10.55]You have to block the arrows.
[71:11.81]I mean, I... Yeah, you watched me.
[71:13.13]You watched me do it.
[71:15.61]I went... And then one time... He did it.
[71:18.87]He didn't do two in a row that last time.
[71:20.94]And then he did two in a row the next time.
[71:22.84]I couldn't dunk it.
[71:25.94]This is the one.
[71:26.46]This is the one.
[71:28.14]This is probably not the one.
[71:32.27]You have to go into it saying, it's not the one.
[71:35.01]There's no way.
[71:36.57]This game's impossible.
[71:37.67]It's not the one.
[71:38.17]This game is literally not completable.
[71:40.31]Okay, so that's how we're going to go into this one.
[71:42.72]Look at this.
[71:44.12]Look what I just got for a second.
[71:46.36]It's impossible.
[71:46.90]I'm not going to do it.
[71:47.96]I'm not going to do it.
[71:48.86]It's impossible.
[71:50.36]I'm not going to do it.
[71:52.06]Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[71:53.19]Let's go in with that mentality and... Yeah, it's just not possible.
[72:04.41]It can't be done.
[72:05.03]No, you're right.
[72:06.74]I'm looking at chat and I'm seeing, yeah, man, it just can't be done.
[72:11.09]And I agree with you.
[72:42.40]Alright.
[72:45.52]13, 5, 5, 8, 3.
[72:46.08]Okay, this is good.
[72:49.01]I still hold on to it.
[72:52.45]Shrine of power.
[72:59.75]Cool.
[73:01.79]Shrine of protection.
[73:02.75]Okay.
[73:08.17]Okay.
[73:53.91]28?
[73:55.61]Better?
[73:57.62]It's just not possible, right?
[73:58.56]Like, it's not gonna happen.
[74:01.23]Okay.
[74:01.35]Okay.
[74:38.60]29.
[74:38.82]Okay.

[76:27.39]You see a portal?
[76:48.51]This is a secret room.
[77:03.99]Why are you not doing two?
[77:21.62]Oh my goodness.
[77:22.94]Alright, I got some good shit.
[77:24.40]I gotta get out of here.
[77:44.97]Don't panic.

[82:31.61]Okay, that's it.
[82:39.15]Now you play another one and lose them all.
[82:42.75]You can also go into a level 2 portal.
[82:45.67]Huh.
[82:48.89]Keep the useful loot, sell it.
[82:50.17]Yeah, you have a stash, right?
[82:59.41]The red portals will take you deeper.

[97:32.55]How do I get down?
[97:43.25]Don't lie!
[97:43.75]They didn't lie, thank God.
[97:45.91]I think there's a portal right over here.
[97:48.87]See that blue?
[98:15.75]That's not a portal.
[98:30.76]I hear somebody screaming.
[98:53.16]I gotta go back up.
[99:08.10]Open the chest?
[99:09.25]No.

[101:05.37]I'm so nervous.
[101:06.47]Oh my god, dude, we're fucking in trouble.
[101:08.56]We're in so much trouble.
[101:12.28]Good luck, dude.

[101:27.31]There's a bunch of fucking adventurers.
[101:42.85]Where is a portal?
[101:45.09]How is there not a portal here?
[101:48.05]There's nowhere else to go!
[101:49.45]Oh, fuck you!
[102:11.54]Run, run, run!
[102:12.44]I got nowhere to run!
[102:13.98]Where is a- Give me that fucking thing on your back!
[102:17.10]I'm dead.
[102:17.72]I'm dead.
[102:18.70]I'm dead.
[102:19.20]Where are they?
[102:20.62]This sucks!
[102:24.46]Where are- Look at this!
[102:26.33]I'm literally running around in circles!
[102:35.32]Oh my god.
[102:37.16]You mean to tell me that there's only- there was one portal up here somewhere?
[102:42.48]Oh, that's such a pain in the ass.
[102:47.55]We're running around this little fucking circle and one- one of the two dickheads is gonna find it.
[102:52.71]This- ugh.
[103:05.97]There was a big ramp?
[103:06.91]Yeah, I'm being followed by this... whatever that guy is.
[103:13.86]He completely fucked me over when he closed that door.
[103:27.59]Oh, that's so fucking sad.
[103:29.51]I had so much good shit too.
[103:37.71]Can he stop you from going the wrong way?
[103:39.89]Well, yeah.
[103:40.81]At 20-20 hindsight, we all know the portal is up here.
[103:43.63]Was it two portals up here?
[104:08.72]Okay.
[104:09.72]Well, I lost everything.
[104:16.74]I still believe.
[104:22.68]Another one spawns in the end.
[104:23.90]Is that right?
[104:33.51]Well, we go for it again.
[104:39.50]That's sad.
[104:41.24]I was right there too.
[104:42.42]It's just like, where?
[104:44.49]Fuck.
[104:59.84]I had such a good weapon.
[105:01.02]Fucking portal bullshit.
[105:24.57]Alright, now I'm pissed off.
[105:26.17]I'm just going in.
[105:26.99]I am killing.
[105:29.09]No friendly.
[105:30.18]I'm not going to crouch with a sandwich in my hand.
[105:32.32]Everybody's dead.
[105:33.72]Everyone.
[105:34.72]I'm going in.
[105:35.18]Who's that?
[106:33.34]Alright, you are... You have a whole combo.
[106:38.00]I'm dead.
[106:47.23]I'm dead.
[106:47.51]I can't move.
[106:52.33]I can't fucking move.
[106:54.07]I'm dead.
[106:56.02]Don't fight these?
[106:57.36]Why not?
[107:01.44]I thought that was a naked player I thought that was a nude player That's a boss?
[107:15.39]Oh
[107:31.92]Should have just crouched with a sandwich, yeah.
[107:33.22]I was going to say, where the hell am I?
[108:05.03]There's so many people in this solo area.
[108:11.58]Am I crazy?
[108:12.34]Or is there like three times as many enemies in solo than the team stuff?
[108:52.79]This guy has the whole dungeon on him.
[108:54.96]I know what it's like, man.
[108:56.32]Trust me, I know what it's like.
[109:00.74]I'm getting out of here.
[109:03.82]See you later.
[109:04.34]I want nothing to do with this.
[109:10.60]I help him.
[109:11.18]He's got seven.
[109:13.90]He's got seven ghouls on him.
[109:16.32]I'm not going to help.
[109:18.98]Oh, my God.
[109:20.12]Everybody has the same problem.
[109:24.26]Okay.
[109:24.88]There's a potion here.
[109:26.04]Hold on.
[109:29.09]Help.
[109:29.45]Help.
[109:30.45]Hold on.

[109:46.37]Drink this.
[109:49.52]Hey, let's go.
[109:52.00]Let's team up on voice command.
[110:12.06]Oh, you had that.
[110:13.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[110:14.16]It did not.
[110:23.66]What is in front of me?
[110:24.34]What is in front of me?
[110:26.56]What the fuck is this?
[110:34.43]Jesus.
[110:34.95]Who are you talking to?
[110:51.99]What are you talking about?
[110:54.95]What?
[110:55.49]Dude, this one is way harder.
[111:05.02]You know when this shit is fucking hard, and just a little much, when each person I saw, I saw two different people, had an absolute just, there was a choo-choo train of enemies running after every single person.
[111:28.00]Dude, this is laser tag on steroids.
[111:30.32]That's funny.
[111:36.17]I was fair and better in the team stuff.
[111:51.76]Alright, same spot.
[112:04.98]I need to test it.
[112:22.10]Did I just hit myself with the sword?
[112:23.86]I'm hitting myself with my own weapon.
[112:45.45]I'm already in trouble.
[112:47.99]I thought that was a player.
[113:14.09]Alright, give me some stuff.
[113:22.13]Alright, way back.
[113:24.71]I just got a green ring that's gonna be worth like 20 bucks.
[114:02.36]What was, what is that?
[114:17.20]I might Ster the campfire.
[114:23.03]Eight, eight.
[114:25.65]Oh shit.
[114:45.28]Okay, I'm going in.
[114:50.72]What is that?
[114:55.59]I got- Okay, I'm gonna set the- I gotta- Ooh, no, I got a bandage.
[115:06.70]No, no, no, no, I don't want to swing!
[115:07.86]Why is it sw- I'm not pressing any buttons!
[115:10.28]I'm- My- Literally, my hands are in the air, guys.
[115:12.16]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[115:14.08]Stop swinging.
[115:15.06]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[115:16.90]I probably just looked like a fucking crazy person.
[115:19.66]Come sit at the campfire.
[115:20.50]Look.
[115:32.39]That's the dumbest thing in the game.
[115:33.79]This literally should be removed.
[115:37.67]They should take it out of the game tomorrow.
[116:36.88]You take all this stuff?
[116:39.38]Ah, you missed this thing on the bottom.
[116:58.51]Oh, stop.
[117:23.41]That shit is way harder.
[117:28.95]I'd rather fight the three players.
[117:41.91]You can see traps on the map.
[117:44.21]Really?
[117:48.65]I can't believe you're dying to level one goblin enemies.
[117:53.25]Yeah, it's pretty rough.
[118:10.00]Alright, there we go.
[118:12.44]Look at this already getting started with some fucking wines of olive oil.
[118:56.35]Ew.
[119:04.46]Holy shit.
[119:05.62]That's not bad.
[119:07.28]Can't use it, but... Okay, I gotta go down.
[119:29.70]Ooh, yep.
[119:35.23]Okay.
[119:36.75]That's a good start.
[119:52.90]Not bad.
[119:56.86]Take my time here.
[119:57.66]I'm kind of in the middle, so I don't really have to go that far.
[120:00.12]Put that on.
[120:25.40]Nice.
[120:38.04]Yep.
[120:40.56]Oh, yep.
[120:47.26]Are those better?
[120:47.82]30, 25, no.
[120:48.60]I'll hold them though.
[120:58.68]I get this whole area to myself.
[121:08.58]Bell book.
[121:11.32]Longbow.
[121:11.70]Should we go in the hole?
[121:26.76]Maybe.
[121:27.60]Ooh.
[121:29.28]Full heal.
[121:31.54]Oh my goodness.
[121:32.60]It's a full heal.
[121:35.42]Okay.
[121:35.90]I got no excuse now.
[122:12.44]Where's the actual circle right now?
[122:14.20]I feel like I'm very far away from it.
[122:38.79]There's a lot of shit in here.
[122:39.69]I'm gonna hang out here for a minute.
[122:56.94]Thinks pretty quick too.
[123:29.49]That's a lot of money.
[123:30.25]Okay, let's go.
[123:31.85]Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot.
[123:44.80]So many chests.
[123:49.05]I gotta turn and run in a second here.
[124:14.18]Okay.
[124:14.52]Time to move.
[124:15.00]I got a lot of money.
[124:18.52]One more chest and I'm going to go.
[124:19.56]I promise.
[124:21.92]Never mind.
[124:31.39]Dark.
[124:33.01]And darker.
[124:52.73]Nah, I think sucks.
[124:53.83]A lot of shit here.
[125:14.88]Fuck.
[125:18.28]Look at all this stuff.
[125:22.83]Fuck.
[125:24.13]Fuck.
[125:29.72]No, I wanna pick it up.
[125:30.70]I wanna pick it up.
[125:53.67]Leave, leave.
[125:54.47]I am, I am.
[125:55.01]I'm going.
[126:05.74]Shit.
[126:17.50]I need a portal!
[126:32.48]It's up, man.
[126:51.09]What the fuck is that?
[126:53.21]What just happened?
[126:55.05]What was that?
[126:57.69]Something just exploded.
[127:02.00]Oh, I got... Okay.
[127:05.54]Oh my god.
[127:06.50]Shit.
[127:18.60]I thought he was alone.
[127:36.99]Alright, what, what is, what is that?
[127:39.55]What is this bullshit right here?
[127:42.91]Why are there two here?
[127:44.41]What is this bullshit?
[127:48.17]How come there's two?
[127:49.78]Why wasn't, what's going on with, were the three portals in the same spot?
[127:57.36]Dude, I was running around like an asshole when I had all that shit, and there was only one.
[128:15.64]They're in the middle.
[128:16.50]I was directly in the center.
[128:38.30]What?
[128:39.10]Look at all these.
[128:40.02]There's so many in this spot.
[128:46.30]Oh, come on.
[128:47.40]They don't start spawning till late?
[129:15.27]Should get near the center early, then camp out till you see the prompts about a portal.
[129:26.36]Back to the caves, I guess.
[129:28.96]Yeah.
[129:30.34]Back to the caves.
[129:36.36]We actually might have a friend here.
[129:39.00]Hold on a second.
[129:50.80]I was gonna play with other... I'm definitely into it.
[129:53.85]So... I'm down to party in random places.
[129:57.19]It's all good.
[130:07.90]I gotta make it up with something.
[130:33.38]I thought a piece of glass like burnt me or whatever.
[130:36.05]You know what I mean?
[130:36.55]At least sharp stab pain.
[130:39.65]Oh, look at that.
[130:42.51]Don't go near that.
[131:04.61]Are they red?
[131:16.29]Fuck you!
[131:18.59]Come on!
[131:19.85]No way!
[131:35.56]I've gotten a lot of gems and jewels.
[131:37.16]Okay.
[131:44.93]I picked solo, right?
[131:48.29]So what were they guarding?
[131:49.73]Can I open this?
[131:51.91]It's locked.
[132:11.58]Hold on while I have a second.
[132:24.48]Hold on typing.
[132:50.43]My attack went right through him.
[132:51.63]Ooh.
[132:55.09]What's resourcefulness?
[132:56.99]What does that do?
[133:06.96]He's sending... He's sending emails to Gunu.
[133:22.56]My whole inventory is stuff that... Okay, I gotta get out.
[133:25.96]I'm getting out of here now.
[133:27.98]I have to escape.
[133:28.86]I just get so obsessed.
[133:43.43]They're supposed to be dead.
[134:04.36]Dude, die!
[134:06.36]You stink!
[134:30.20]How many spiders are in this cave?
[135:01.41]Please leave.
[135:02.67]I'm, I'm right now.
[135:03.69]Um, um, yeah.
[135:05.81]Okay.
[135:05.95]We're good.
[135:06.63]Okay.
[135:07.39]Cool.
[135:09.05]Alright.
[135:09.81]You, you good?
[135:10.85]We good.
[135:11.11]Okay, dude.
[135:20.90]Why is this thing still alive?
[135:23.36]Why is this thing still alive?
[135:25.20]I hit it like seven times.
[135:38.90]Are we cool?
[135:39.54]We're all cool, right?
[135:41.30]Oh my god, this is how you play!
[135:43.98]You don't just like... You just don't act like a rabid animal.
[135:48.41]You can... Okay.
[135:52.75]Wow.
[135:54.17]What's that?
[136:06.60]Thank you.
[136:08.80]I thought he was gonna hit me.
[136:19.93]I am not going to kill the- No, I need- You know how many- I'm not gonna say this out loud.
[136:25.11]I don't have shit on me.
[136:27.21]I have nothing on me.
[136:28.88]I don't have a bunch of jewels or anything.
[136:32.04]Did you crouch?
[136:33.82]Did you crouch yet?
[136:45.66]What's this?
[136:53.04]What the fuck is that?
[136:54.72]Oh my, it's a red spider.
[137:13.41]No.
[137:14.59]That is not happening.
[137:16.80]Uh-oh.
[137:18.80]Uh-oh.
[137:19.08]Is there a way to... Oh, no.
[137:25.92]No!
[137:28.50]What do I do?
[137:28.92]I think I have to just go... I don't know.
[137:33.34]How do I fix this?
[137:34.00]How do I fix this?
[137:44.93]I have to run through it?
[137:45.59]Okay.
[138:02.46]Portal?
[138:06.30]Bro, where are the freaking portals?
[138:50.68]Are they gone?
[138:51.30]Why is there not one here?
[138:58.18]What?
[139:00.22]I thought it would spawn in the circle where I was.
[139:06.03]What?
[139:09.77]They were on the floor above me.
[139:11.61]Bro.
[139:29.59]With all that verticality, how can you tell where one ever is?
[139:35.35]They're all first come, first serve.
[139:46.26]They always seem to spawn on the top floor.
[139:48.28]Is that for real, or is that just...
[140:01.19]So they're always on the top floor.
[140:15.87]I made it up.
[140:16.81]Oh.
[140:49.70]I just said, hey, win, motherfucker.
[140:53.48]Not that easy.
[140:57.33]There we go.
[140:58.29]Alright, we're back in it now.
[140:59.79]We're back in it.
[141:25.37]I'm poisoned.
[141:30.45]The poison sucks.
[141:32.60]You get hit once, dude, and you're fucking, it's over.
[141:36.49]God damn it.
[141:54.48]What the fuck?
[141:55.60]I'm already dead.
[142:19.02]Shoot.
[142:35.68]A lot of money.
[143:15.17]Your health is low.
[143:15.89]Do you have any potions or food?
[143:18.09]I don't know what's up there, but I'm not going over there.
[143:23.95]Sorry, I read that from chat.
[143:25.09]I had to do it.
[143:40.66]What?
[143:41.52]There's no way you hit me with that.
[143:44.77]Get out of town.
[143:58.13]I'm in so much trouble.
[144:03.69]No, no.
[144:05.97]No, I'm in so much trouble.
[144:08.50]There's a fucking plate right there.
[144:18.62]Ah!
[144:18.94]What?
[144:19.38]Where are they?
[144:19.84]I blocked it.
[144:27.11]Fuck, man.
[144:29.13]This is so hard.
[144:30.17]I got decapitated.
[144:35.15]God damn it.
[144:39.73]I gotta buy something.
[144:42.01]I have to buy something.
[144:44.13]I'm buying.
[144:44.93]I'm gonna lose all my money.
[144:52.75]I'm buying a... I don't know.
[144:57.01]I'm buying this longsword.
[144:58.83]No, I'm not.
[144:59.45]34.
[145:01.51]I'm buying this.
[145:13.85]I gotta give myself a chance, right?
[145:15.17]47.
[145:15.19]This one's 13.
[145:37.21]Let's go.
[145:41.32]Believers are filing for bankruptcy.
[145:54.66]At least I have some armor and more than 20 damage.
[146:02.73]We're good.
[146:03.67]Everything's good.
[146:19.68]Does he make it out alive?
[146:20.81]2.1 to 9 point... Wow.
[146:31.81]Well, if I win, I make a lot of you really, really rich with channel points, that's for sure.
[146:36.92]Alright, where's this lever?
[146:39.60]There.
[146:51.72]This thing is huge.
[147:02.99]You just put two... That's what's in here.
[147:04.97]For a second, I was stuck.
[147:31.53]That was so loud.
[147:41.60]Patch it?
[147:42.84]No.
[147:44.34]What is this?
[147:48.20]What did that do?
[147:52.42]Secret.
[147:56.27]Stop it.
[148:11.46]Stop!
[148:11.58]Throw a torch at it?
[148:27.98]Yes.
[148:35.06]Ooooh.
[148:38.06]A spear.
[148:41.14]I don't know how to use this.
[148:42.94]Is it 34 versus 39?
[148:44.74]I don't know.
[148:46.36]It's probably got a lot of reach, though.
[148:53.18]Looks like... Okay, so the last one is a swing down.
[149:05.18]Looks like it has a block.
[149:07.04]At least, or a parry, at least.
[149:08.11]Okay, cool.
[149:08.89]Alright, let's go.
[149:20.33]Why?
[149:25.40]This is a maze.
[150:14.22]Thought that was a player.
[150:15.04]That stood away from me.
[150:26.45]Oh!
[150:53.75]Good.
[151:23.94]Portal up.
[151:33.16]Holy shit.
[152:14.26]Oh my god.
[152:17.54]Tell me how to tell.
[152:18.50]How can you tell?
[152:19.44]Okay.
[152:22.24]Okay.
[152:23.34]I'm not... What do I do?
[152:29.69]What the fuck?
[152:35.52]There's no pressure plate.
[152:37.00]They're just little blended into the walls.
[152:39.26]The map will show.
[152:40.27]That's so teeny tiny.
[152:43.07]I ain't looking over there.
[152:45.63]What?
[152:45.99]It wasn't on the map.
[152:47.37]I'm looking at the map right now.
[152:48.91]What am I standing on?
[152:50.41]Excuse me?
[152:51.79]What?
[152:53.25]What is happening?
[152:56.69]Did you see the mini map?
[152:58.09]There was two behind me.
[152:59.09]There was one.
[153:00.51]My indicator was on top of it.
[153:04.38]My little indicator.
[153:06.18]It's so teeny little tiny.
[153:08.99]My character's arrow indicator was covering it.
[153:12.01]Oh my god.
[153:22.28]You can crouch?
[153:37.05]Crouch.
[153:38.05]I didn't know you could avoid it by crouching.
[153:39.99]How was I supposed to know that?
[153:42.49]It reminds me of Darkest Dungeon.
[153:51.30]When you just walk in and all of a sudden it's just like like the thing just fucking the trap on the ground just attacks you.
[154:21.22]I'm fucking angry now.
[154:23.45]You know I... Is that me or you?
[154:28.03]I thought that was a mage.
[154:29.66]I thought that was a player.
[154:31.36]This is not a player.
[154:34.30]Come on, man.
[154:37.89]I can't...
[154:50.75]What the fuck?
[154:52.71]Get him!
[154:53.17]Kill him with this!
[155:08.79]Shit.
[155:13.55]Come on!
[155:14.25]Fucking die!
[155:20.32]Oh shit, it's over.
[155:25.15]That was such a shitty spawn.
[155:26.57]Oh, well.
[155:30.07]Swing at it?
[155:31.45]That thing's like a super hard thing.
[155:40.56]Block it?
[155:41.36]I think it goes through the block.
[155:43.92]Otto!
[155:45.55]What?
[155:50.13]It's Otto.
[155:50.71]This dog's name's Otto?
[156:00.34]It's Otto.
[156:05.94]That's cool.
[156:07.90]That's cool.
[156:08.70]Look, it's Otto.
[156:12.37]Remember, that was a cat.
[156:22.88]Everybody loves Otto.
[156:27.11]You're dying too fast for mods to be able to put up new polls.
[156:31.84]Dude, I'm sorry.
[156:33.80]What am I supposed to do?
[157:00.23]Did I get poisoned?
[157:01.59]Oh, come on.
[157:21.12]That's a big deal.
[157:23.52]Plus one knowledge.
[157:24.44]I'm so much smarter with this on.
[157:38.14]Look out.
[157:58.66]I want to mine this so bad.
[158:00.50]That's where you get the crystals.
[158:11.90]Is there more than one?
[158:12.58]There was two.
[158:16.81]Throwing Axe?
[158:21.07]Agility and action speed.
[158:23.41]Cool.
[158:32.58]Nice.
[158:33.22]Okay, not bad.
[158:46.96]Can't put any of that on.
[158:47.74]Fuck, I tried to dodge it.
[159:15.95]A lot of boots down here.
[159:17.17]18.
[159:21.33]Get rid of these things.
[159:25.30]This is all crap.
[159:26.44]This is not even worth selling.
[159:31.04]Wizard shoes?
[159:33.62]Who's going to buy that?
[159:34.44]No one's going to want to even take that from me.
[159:49.32]Better hear something.
[159:53.08]Alright, I'm going to try to get out of here.
[160:27.61]Where did you go?
[160:31.21]Where did you come from, Cottonado?
[160:50.16]The group over there.
[160:50.90]Spiders.
[161:18.93]I'm mashing.
[161:19.63]I'm mashing it.
[161:20.63]That means I'm a friend.
[161:21.47]He doesn't care.
[161:25.90]He doesn't care.
[161:26.78]He doesn't care.
[161:27.36]He doesn't care.
[161:34.92]Oh my god, I had 50% HP.
[161:36.34]God damn it, dude.
[161:39.85]I don't... I'm just... Oh no, no, crouch and people will be friends.
[161:44.07]That person was a rabid animal.
[161:45.25]Just like, whatever.
[161:45.99]Whatever.
[162:10.19]I didn't have very much health.
[162:11.51]I had, like, what, half health?
[162:14.17]I tried to do... I pressed control too many times.
[162:17.47]I sticky-keyed myself as somebody that was just easy to kill.
[162:24.27]Control, control, control, control!
[162:26.57]Kill that one.
[162:38.40]Oh, nice.
[162:49.22]I'm so addicted to this game, but I can't win.
[162:52.80]It's so frustrating.
[163:06.85]Get your ass away from me.
[163:09.63]My God, just restart.
[163:11.99]I'm fucking pissed.
[163:24.23]Try another class.
[163:27.35]I need to get at least one more.
[163:30.43]I need to get out one more time.
[163:32.70]I'm not turning the stream off unless I survive again.
[163:36.70]I don't care if I'm here for ten straight days.
[163:40.38]I'm not turning the stream off until I get out again.
[163:43.78]I don't care if it takes a hundred years.
[163:50.05]I don't care if I turn to dust in this chair.
[163:57.44]Okay, we're good.
[163:59.52]This is not a bad place to spawn.
[164:19.26]Explosion bottle.
[164:27.32]Why am I not doing the strategy?
[164:30.30]This is impossible.
[164:31.68]I'm never going to do it.
[164:34.51]Everybody accept it right now.
[164:35.81]It's never happening.
[164:36.75]I will never do it.
[164:39.41]It's just, I mean, pack it up.
[164:41.11]It's just not happening.
[164:41.97]It's never going to happen.
[164:44.15]I escaped last time I said that.
[164:49.50]Look at how much stuff is on that fucking goddamn cupboard.
[165:16.95]That hurt a lot.
[165:41.21]You didn't hit me.
[165:41.97]You swung around my body.
[165:48.58]Okay.
[165:49.54]Look at all this stuff.
[165:57.56]Oh, my God.
[166:05.35]It's so many things.
[166:10.05]I'm taking... Oh my god, that was a blue.
[166:11.61]I'm taking the whole entire Antiques Roadshow with me.
[166:16.72]I have to get out of here now.
[166:17.93]I'm gonna run to the middle.
[166:18.53]I'm gonna hide.
[166:18.97]I'm literally gonna hide in a corner.
[167:20.23]Why do I hear so many noises?
[167:26.18]What is that?
[167:27.22]Oh, I'm so fucking jumpy.
[167:45.29]Hey!
[167:45.63]Hey!
[167:45.95]Hey!
[167:46.89]Stay back!
[168:10.86]You piece of shit!
[168:13.32]No, I wasn't ready!
[168:14.38]I wasn't ready!
[168:15.30]I wasn't ready!
[168:15.90]Fuck, I wasn't ready!
[168:18.88]He scared the fuck out of me!
[168:25.50]Oh my god!
[168:26.58]It's just like he appeared behind me and my heart started to go... Fuck!
[168:40.59]I had a full heal.
[168:41.71]How- but I- am I gonna be like... Done.
[168:54.83]How long does it take to heal?
[169:02.57]Every other heal in the game, besides the health potions, is it like an instant heal?
[169:06.12]I'm thinking like it's a bandage.
[169:08.18]It probably takes a long time.
[169:10.56]And he's doing this like, forward, back, forward, forward, back, forward, back, forward, back, snap, forward, back, forward, back, forward.
[169:20.84]He swings so much faster than me.
[169:27.97]It takes a good 30 seconds to heal with the surgical kits.
[169:30.33]Yeah.
[169:39.66]Was that a poison dagger too?
[169:41.14]I feel like it was.
[169:42.48]It was poisoned.
[169:54.99]Where...
[170:15.91]Oh, there's three things here.
[170:17.11]Never mind.
[170:25.56]You'll do an attack chain?
[170:26.52]Yeah, but I feel like though it's me holding down the attack button, he'll stab me four times and I'm dead.
[170:33.61]Like I have to block.
[170:42.59]So much shit in here.
[170:50.43]Alright, why did... Outplayed by the AI.
[171:08.26]The AI stopped moving and just sat there looking at me.
[171:19.39]Regardless of the loss rate?
[171:22.13]Well, I mean, it's the first day I've ever played it.
[171:25.83]Come on.
[171:26.27]Give me a break.
[171:27.93]I've never played this before.
[171:29.25]This is the first time I've ever played a video game.
[171:32.11]Guys, I'm an actor.
[171:33.79]I'm an actor.
[171:34.35]I don't play video games.
[171:36.67]I'm an actor.
[171:48.90]Stop.
[172:18.87]Alright.
[172:20.51]Let's do it.
[172:23.93]I'll change classes after this.
[172:25.19]I'll try the Ranger.
[172:41.03]Ranger rules?
[172:43.51]Did I get it?
[172:44.95]I did.
[172:45.17]Okay.
[172:49.27]Ranger is snooze.
[172:52.27]I would want to try it at least once.
[173:12.82]Ranger is not great solo.
[173:15.14]I feel like this is a great solo class.
[173:17.84]Could be wrong.
[173:25.90]Is that incorrect?
[173:27.78]Rogue is.
[173:31.94]Wizard is crazy solo.
[173:34.28]Really?
[173:35.34]Interesting.
[173:35.78]Do you like spaghetti?
[173:47.58]This is my only question.
[173:49.04]Yeah, I love spaghetti.
[174:05.34]That?
[174:06.56]I'll be taking that one.
[174:12.58]This looks like a trap.
[174:21.39]It's not on the mini-map.
[174:23.63]It's not on the mini-map.
[174:24.79]Where is it on the mini-map?
[174:26.25]It's not on the mini-map!
[174:27.90]It's not on the mini-map!
[174:43.17]Oh, I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[174:44.23]Actually, I think I'm alright.
[175:06.99]I'm... I'm... Help!
[175:07.91]Help!
[175:08.51]I won't fight you!
[175:09.15]I won't fight you!
[175:11.21]I won't fight you!
[175:12.76]Let's work together.
[175:13.80]I'm not gonna fight you.
[175:14.48]Look, see, I haven't swung at you.
[175:16.10]I'm protecting you.
[175:16.64]I'm helping.
[175:19.56]Let's go.
[175:19.86]Let's get out of here.
[175:26.10]Yes!
[175:31.88]I feel like he's gonna hit me.
[175:37.25]Well, I keep looking.
[175:38.03]I don't know.
[175:38.29]I feel like he's gonna hurt me.
[175:39.17]We should probably...
[175:44.00]Wow!
[175:46.18]Okay, cool.
[175:46.50]Alright, we need to- we gotta find a portal.
[175:47.70]We gotta get out of here.
[175:50.63]It's Bugleberry!
[176:00.60]Should we try to kill the boss?
[176:16.60]What is going on here?
[176:27.94]Hey, stop hitting me.
[176:28.88]Why is he hitting me?
[176:30.28]Why is he hitting me?
[176:31.32]Wait, who's, wait, what?
[176:33.76]Was it a different person?
[176:34.52]Was it a different guy?
[176:36.62]What do you mean it was a different guy?
[176:38.52]It looked exactly the same.
[176:39.46]It was the same person.
[176:47.23]That was a different guy.
[176:50.15]They had the same exact clothes on.
[176:52.66]It was the same person.
[177:05.07]All the classes look the same, but yeah, but they had the same robe on.
[177:07.99]They had the same staff.
[177:10.13]No, they didn't.
[177:10.65]He had like a club.
[177:11.45]I don't, whatever.
[177:14.41]He was behind me.
[177:15.25]I turn around.
[177:16.57]He's right there.
[177:17.29]I'm thinking that's my buddy with the fucking magical shit.
[177:28.66]Maybe it was a trap.
[177:29.63]Maybe he lured you into it.
[177:37.17]God damn it.
[177:38.89]I need to... I've spent all my money.
[177:42.03]I have like five gold.
[177:46.71]Yeah, I kind of just... I see a Bugleberry walking towards me.
[177:51.20]I'm like, oh, that's Bugleberry.
[177:53.36]Because he was just... He was right there a second ago.
[177:56.26]And then I get hit in the head with a fucking mace.
[177:57.92]I was just like, wait, what's happening?
[178:02.31]Why is everything going dark?
[178:04.49]My head hurts.
[178:16.37]Oh my goodness, this is so bad.
[178:17.63]There's a diamond.
[178:24.54]Should I just leave?
[179:09.97]Why is he still alive?
[179:14.36]Run now.
[179:16.14]Run now.
[179:16.82]Run now.
[179:17.92]Run now.
[179:19.98]Oh.
[179:21.24]Okay.
[179:35.25]Bugleberry!
[180:16.45]Okay, I've got a diamond.
[180:31.83]Good work.
[180:32.99]You can take that loot.
[180:34.05]I'm a fucking good guy like that.
[180:52.15]Yeah, I know.
[180:53.79]See?
[180:54.71]It's not just me.
[180:56.19]You make fun of me.
[180:57.07]It's not just me.
[180:57.99]It's not just me.
[180:58.49]Everybody gets hit by that shit.
[181:11.82]He's dead!
[181:12.52]What happened to him?
[181:15.70]What the hell happened?
[181:17.44]What happened?
[181:20.30]What?
[181:22.54]Dude, I can't do this right now.
[181:29.19]What happened?
[181:29.99]I feel so bad.
[181:31.69]Why did he die?
[181:32.85]Oh, he's got lots of fucking jewels on him though.
[181:57.20]Give me a portal.
[181:57.92]Get me out of here already.
[181:58.90]I have, like, stuff.
[182:09.92]Okay, I'm just... I'm gonna find a portal.
[182:11.37]I'm just going to the middle.
[182:22.09]This is gonna be awful.
[182:24.60]We're in this room.
[182:25.46]It's huge.
[182:26.08]Look at all this verticality, all this bullshit.
[182:33.38]Camp in the middle until the circle closes in and the portal's spun.
[182:37.32]That's kind of the goal right now.
[182:41.16]I'm just gonna sit right here and no one's even gonna fucking see me.
[183:23.87]I need to go over here.
[183:24.59]Okay, I'm going in here and I'm going to hang out in this one.
[183:29.63]This is where I'm going to sit.
[183:33.92]Close every door and turn all the torches off.
[183:54.67]One person has escaped.
[183:56.19]One person escaped.
[183:56.77]Portals appeared.
[184:16.08]You fucking piece of shit.
[184:18.67]That's how he died.
[184:20.45]Where is it?
[184:30.87]Come on.
[184:31.57]Is it above me or something?
[184:32.65]I'm gonna go up.
[184:37.24]Ow!
[184:38.12]I can't.
[184:39.06]I can't.
[184:39.44]I can't do it.
[184:40.78]I can't do it.
[184:41.36]I can't do it.
[184:42.78]I'm gonna die if I go up.
[184:44.28]I don't have any more healing potions.
[184:47.73]You have to.
[185:04.74]This game is so fucking hard.
[185:08.36]The fact that you have to find one of these portals and it could be anywhere.
[185:11.46]And like, where the fuck do I even have to go?
[185:27.61]So there was one portal somewhere in that area somewhere.
[185:43.56]I mean, I was just down.
[185:44.55]I went up, but the thing was already there.
[185:46.57]If you waited another portable to spawn, you were the last person.
[185:58.59]Is there any way I can see that?
[185:59.99]Or do I just have to keep track of the kill feed?
[186:03.26]How would I know I'm the last person?
[186:05.16]Does it tell you?
[186:12.44]I kind of just want to die so I can just start the map.
[186:18.91]Where on the map?
[186:20.23]I see the timer.
[186:23.75]Does it show player count?
[186:25.23]I know I'm dead.
[186:26.25]I'm just trying to see where is there an indicator?
[186:28.95]It's on top.
[186:38.21]No, that one doesn't count.
[186:49.06]So let me, I got a question.
[186:50.18]So even if everybody is dead, you're dead too if you don't go in one of the random portals.
[186:57.43]Everybody's dead.
[186:58.49]You still have to leave.
[186:59.29]Fuck.
[187:17.17]This ain't Fortnite.
[187:19.69]Focus on just finding a portal.
[187:37.84]Yeah, I'm not going to find one until late game.
[187:41.56]So is it a certain minute-wise or a certain how big the circle is?
[187:46.75]The one thing I'm getting confused at is... So I was the last person left there.
[187:50.44]How come there weren't just portals everywhere?
[187:53.76]In that... Because remember, like, three or four games ago, there were, like, five portals in the middle at the end.
[187:58.86]It's just based on time.
[188:11.85]It was map size.
[188:16.18]In the Goblin Caves, only three portals open up every time.
[188:20.90]Only three people could leave?
[188:22.16]Oh my god, that sucks.
[188:26.93]It's based on how many players are there.
[188:29.35]Jesus.
[188:35.16]Well...
[188:51.65]Somebody's walking.
[188:53.98]Not that person, by the way.
[188:55.16]I heard something.
[188:57.74]I'm telling you, it's not this person.
[189:22.01]Okay, I got a pretty good helmet.
[189:30.82]Come on now.
[189:32.80]Ten goddamn minutes.
[189:51.78]Alright, get it all.
[190:02.02]I'm kind of in the middle already.
[190:23.24]So now just go up.
[190:28.89]Alright.
[190:30.19]Where is up?
[190:35.57]Somebody was here.
[190:36.31]Does anything on the mini-map look like a staircase?
[190:42.78]Like, what does a staircase look like?
[190:45.10]On the mini-map.
[190:45.62]I don't think it looks like anything.
[190:46.98]Okay, I'm up now.
[191:01.70]I always make a habit of crouching in hallways.
[191:05.40]Not a bad idea.
[191:12.53]Nice.
[191:12.75]Alright, besides my weapon, I've got... I'm alright.
[191:17.63]I've got some pretty good stuff.
[191:21.65]Why am I going down?
[191:23.13]Oh.
[191:26.44]Okay, nevermind.
[191:42.14]After this, I'm just going for survival.
[191:54.05]This is a huge chest.
[191:55.13]Come on, give me something.
[191:56.83]Give me something and just let me hide.
[192:04.20]It's alright.
[192:05.28]49.
[192:05.96]Pretty good.
[192:06.52]23.
[192:06.54]33.
[192:06.56]Get rid of that crap.
[192:12.26]Get rid of this bow too.
[192:13.48]Fuck this thing.
[192:16.12]Get rid of this tunic.
[192:19.18]Okay.
[192:20.08]Alright.
[192:20.80]Alright.
[192:21.42]It's time to escape with the jewels and the gems.
[192:36.66]Oh, no.
[192:52.13]Okay, a portal is out.
[193:16.61]There's a magical sword in there.
[193:31.48]Can it jump over?
[193:36.09]Ow!
[193:51.59]I want whatever that is.
[194:07.68]That's pretty good.
[194:11.38]Oh, I'm so bad at inventory management.
[194:53.02]Are we friends?
[194:53.50]Okay, be careful, be careful.
[195:06.00]Whoa!
[195:07.04]That's dangerous up there.
[195:21.09]Can I get through this?
[195:25.95]Why can't I get through that?
[195:35.82]Equip the sword?
[195:36.48]I can't-
[196:01.46]Dude, come on.
[196:02.80]I need a portal.
[196:08.90]Look for the portal?
[196:09.50]That's what I'm doing.
[196:10.95]I'm telling you, I'm looking for one right now.
[196:12.79]Is that one right there?
[196:20.03]It might be.
[196:27.52]Get me out of here.
[196:29.95]Get me out of here.
[196:30.49]Get me out of here.
[196:30.97]Get me out of here.
[196:31.43]Get me out of here.
[196:31.89]Get me out of here.
[196:32.63]Believers, we made it.
[196:37.43]Second time tonight.
[196:46.36]Oh, that's so stressful needing to go find one of these fucking things.
[196:54.24]It's so stressful because you just don't know where it is.
[196:56.80]And there's so many people that are trying to kill you.
[196:58.52]Okay.
[197:02.34]I did get some decent stuff.
[197:03.80]I should be able to sell some of that.
[197:12.01]I'm going to put sunglasses on so many emotes.
[197:15.57]Yeah, you earned it.
[197:17.23]You earned it.
[197:22.02]Is it a fun game?
[197:23.12]It is.
[197:29.63]It's very addicting.
[197:31.63]It's very, very hard, though.
[197:35.65]It's a game where one single mistake will just delete all the stuff you have.
[197:46.12]And I am very prone to mistakes.
[197:49.50]So, take that as you will.
[198:00.60]Yeah, I was gonna maybe party up with some people, but I wanted to make sure I actually liked it first.
[198:06.98]Rather than get into a game with two or three people, and it's like, I actually really don't really like it.
[198:12.68]And 20 minutes into the game, be like, well, sorry guys, it's not for me, and leave.
[198:39.68]I think I can just exit, right?
[198:42.25]It's not going to hurt me.
[198:49.95]Oh my God.
[198:50.57]Alright.
[198:50.97]Look at all this.
[198:54.03]I got a big battle axe.
[198:59.99]Okay.
[199:01.31]God, I haven't clicked on a merchant in four hours or whatever it's been.
[199:14.14]Nice.
[199:15.66]Nice, Jesus.
[199:23.21]76 bucks.
[199:26.95]I actually have money now.
[199:35.83]So the real question is, is it worth me taking that perk to use this?
[199:47.95]No.
[199:48.47]So I should just sell it.
[199:57.01]Shield is better.
[199:57.61]Yeah.
[200:02.14]Oh, I am going to hold on to these.
[200:03.68]Alright.
[200:07.36]I got 94 bucks.
[200:14.38]I get rid of this thing.
[200:17.66]33, 23.
[200:17.70]Okay.
[200:28.09]So.
[200:31.63]We're going to be conservative Andy.
[200:35.75]If I have a decent one, I'm not going to, I'm going to take the worst one.
[200:40.27]We're going to be conservative Andy here.
[200:43.75]And I'm going to take all my money in my inventory.
[200:48.60]And, um, just cause I really want to like flash my wealth around.
[200:52.39]You know what I mean?
[201:06.14]I feel like that would be like somebody's little brother.
[201:10.66]If you killed somebody and they had like a hundred gold on or something, if they go, you just don't, you don't understand what's happening right now.
[201:22.75]Okay.
[201:25.55]It's gotta be nice.
[201:27.09]I refuse to have a stash that doesn't look perfect.
[201:29.29]Okay.
[201:38.11]Now I might take some of this shit off.
[201:43.35]Depends.
[201:45.07]Alright, weapons.
[201:45.91]Myth.
[201:54.90]see those blue letters and it just makes me sad.
[202:07.87]Uh, 22.
[202:09.55]I could buy a Baoshian.
[202:17.07]Seems pretty good.
[202:19.23]Don't buy weapons.
[202:25.24]I'm going to buy it.
[202:27.26]Okay.
[202:38.07]Armor.
[202:40.11]Is there a button I can do to compare?
[202:42.74]Or no, I just have to mouse over?
[202:44.20]This is the same thing.
[202:46.44]It's just a little higher.
[202:54.60]Is there anything that I'm missing?
[202:59.41]Not really.
[203:06.95]Yeah, buy healing supplies.
[203:07.93]10 HP, 15 HP.
[203:16.62]Isn't this just way worse?
[203:18.52]Hold on.
[203:19.38]Three of these versus three of these.
[203:20.80]That's an extra 15 health.
[203:24.22]45 gold.
[203:40.81]This is 15 HP over 20 seconds.
[203:45.74]15 HP over 20 seconds.
[203:47.60]I feel like the bandage is just better.
[203:49.74]But you can drink that and move around.
[203:52.94]Oh.
[203:56.05]This one's cheap.
[203:58.23]Six.
[203:59.37]No, it's the same.
[204:14.74]What's this do?
[204:16.74]Huh.
[204:17.82]Only one gold.
[204:19.34]I'll take it.
[204:28.03]Taylor.
[204:35.29]I want to buy this so bad, but I don't have enough money.
[204:37.81]No, I need a hundred.
[204:39.21]Okay.
[204:40.98]Alright.
[204:42.64]Here's the, here's the plan.
[204:46.92]Here's the plan.
[205:27.82]I'm going for it.
[205:28.24]I'm going for it.
[205:35.38]I'm scared to take most of my good stuff, but you gotta do it.
[205:49.23]Okay, here we go.
[205:51.47]Let's go.
[206:02.79]Survive.
[206:07.47]Perks, you fool.
[206:10.33]I think I'm alright.
[206:18.81]If you see a party of three, run.
[206:21.19]How much longer are you going to go tonight?
[206:32.63]At least another couple hours.
[206:33.57]I already blew it.
[206:54.72]See, the problem is my... Hold on, I'll talk in a minute.
[207:14.10]Alright, the problem is... I, um... It's really hot in this room.
[207:20.05]And I'm wearing a big-ass sweater.
[207:24.47]I mean, it's open.
[207:25.97]I'm... It's just like a... It's not a sweater.
[207:30.99]It's just like a... It's like a sweatshirt.
[207:34.61]I'm... There's nothing under here.
[207:36.30]I'm kind of bare chest and bare belly.
[207:39.20]And I just have this thing on.
[207:40.20]I don't know why I put it on.
[207:47.32]I was like, why did I put this on?
[207:52.72]I don't have a webcam on anymore.
[207:56.19]Who gives a shit?
[208:06.31]Why are you wearing a sweater?
[208:08.19]It's not, it's like a little, how do you even describe it?
[208:10.93]It's like open.
[208:11.75]It's like an open sweatshirt.
[208:15.63]I was like, what?
[208:16.35]I thought you said you didn't have any clothes on.
[208:18.45]Why'd you lie to us?
[208:19.11]I don't know.
[208:24.45]World ain't fair, alright?
[208:25.51]It was a cardigan.
[208:35.14]No, it was not.
[208:40.64]I would not wear a cardigan right now.
[208:44.31]Ooh.
[208:45.15]Was it better?
[208:45.57]Oh, I'm sorry for lying.
[208:53.20]I wasn't actually lying though.
[208:54.36]I was like shirtless.
[208:58.35]Sorry.
[209:21.98]Didn't know you were doing that.
[209:28.24]Just shoot your buddy in the back, please.
[209:29.94]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[209:57.31]Use your heals you bought.
[209:59.05]I'll save them.
[210:14.88]Ten.
[210:17.38]Well, okay.
[210:17.82]That was a lot.
[210:19.94]Is it already time to leave?
[210:31.99]I don't need two shit leather caps.
[210:49.91]Will you forgive me?
[211:11.95]Can I pick that up?
[211:24.64]Somebody was here.
[211:25.32]Okay, relax.
[211:28.42]You already cleaned this place out?
[211:31.10]Whomever.
[211:52.23]Nice.
[212:20.18]What if I'm a friend?
[212:21.80]You probably have friends.
[212:22.88]He's probably screaming over Discord right now.
[212:25.26]He's probably like, hey, hey, there's a guy here, there's a guy here.
[212:28.39]He's got good gear, man, good gear.
[212:30.99]No, I ain't fucking with that.
[212:33.11]He's literally probably in voice chat right now with two other people.
[212:39.95]Imagine looking at this guy.
[212:42.14]You look at what I got.
[212:44.68]You're coming for me.
[212:57.37]The portal.
[213:16.26]Oh, I can't use that.
[213:17.08]That's annoying.
[213:29.23]Somebody said, hey, dude, this dude's gear is ass.
[213:31.43]Let's ignore him.
[213:32.25]Hey, this dude's gear is ass.
[213:38.41]Don't worry.
[213:38.85]No, no, no, no, no.
[213:43.78]Guys, everything's going to be fine.
[213:45.10]I've been watching this dude stream.
[213:47.52]He's literally only escaped twice and he's been playing for four hours.
[213:51.56]I mean, he's probably going to die anyways.
[213:52.86]I kind of feel bad killing him.
[213:53.82]He's like one of these shitty streamers that like does not have play.
[213:56.94]I feel kind of bad.
[214:06.48]He's lighting something on his hand.
[214:07.92]Everybody has friends.
[214:23.11]You have friends, don't you?
[214:37.32]I'm gonna go the other way.
[214:44.24]There's portals everywhere now.
[214:46.26]Where?
[214:46.54]Ah!
[214:54.71]I'm sorry.
[214:55.43]That fucking scared the shit out of me.
[214:57.25]I thought they were behind me.
[215:01.05]I really thought they were behind me.
[215:12.55]There's so many portals.
[215:14.52]How have I not run into one?
[215:15.64]How have I not run into one?
[215:48.32]actually hit me.
[215:55.46]I need my fucking torch!
[216:32.25]What's that sound?
[216:34.82]Sound?
[216:35.14]I heard one.
[216:35.48]I heard one.
[216:36.34]Hey, hey, hey.
[216:37.86]Where is it?
[216:38.24]I heard one.
[216:38.72]I just heard it.
[216:39.16]Where was it?
[216:56.81]I hear them.
[217:08.36]Where are they?
[217:09.02]Where's the portal?
[217:12.38]Oh, fuck you!
[217:13.46]Let's get out of here!
[217:20.44]See you later.
[217:33.08]That's more money.
[217:45.13]I didn't think you could get any louder.
[217:47.06]Oh, I'm sorry.
[217:52.66]Alright, for one second, I thought this was a three-part story.
[217:56.92]Like something, this is like a cards on this character.
[217:59.63]Like he was eating something, he ate it, and it was gross, and it hurt him, or something.
[218:04.41]It looks like, oh, like, I'm testing this, and it's like, ahhh!
[218:12.20]I thought it was like three po- for some reason for one second I was like, oh, he's like poisoned, he ate something.
[218:26.49]A story in three acts.
[218:36.42]Yes!
[218:38.08]Oh yeah, look at that.
[218:39.18]Check this out.
[218:41.16]Nice.
[218:45.27]Not bad.
[218:45.77]Nice.
[218:59.02]Alright.
[219:00.70]What do you do with silver?
[219:01.64]Alright, like silver.
[219:09.14]What do you do with it?
[219:11.82]You got more perks?
[219:12.44]Yeah.
[219:13.10]Check it out.
[219:14.42]You sell it.
[219:33.26]That's pretty good.
[219:34.70]Nice.
[219:35.18]20 more bucks.
[219:40.25]I'll keep the bear trap.
[219:42.99]Now I have a really important question.
[219:46.71]Do I buy this?
[219:53.58]Should I do it?
[219:55.07]It's going to be a blue weapon.
[220:00.31]I'm going to lose all of my money, but it'll be worth it because I'll have a blue in my inventory.
[220:04.09]I'm not going to equip it.
[220:10.29]I'm not equipping this.
[220:11.17]I just want to make sure I have a blue.
[220:12.51]So if somebody comes to this stream and they see me at stash, they go, alright, he's got a blue.
[220:17.91]He's fucking alright.
[220:18.93]He knows what he's doing.
[220:20.59]He's got a blue up there.
[220:22.23]I was literally just going to leave the stream, but he's alright.
[220:34.18]Spend on utility so you can survive.
[220:39.65]Hmm.
[220:43.79]Do I sell this to him?
[220:45.45]Not interested in buying.
[220:47.07]Again, explain to me what I do with silver.
[221:00.69]Sell to the treasurer.
[221:08.97]Golden.
[221:10.01]Golden silver is my language.
[221:17.97]Buy the one.
[221:18.87]Oh, wait a minute.
[221:20.37]Oh.
[221:23.99]One is three.
[221:26.93]Five is 15.
[221:27.63]Am I getting scammed or is this just the exchange rate?
[221:34.14]Buy a coin purse.
[221:38.72]It's just always three to one.
[221:45.57]Alright.
[221:46.79]This is really good.
[221:53.84]Much more money now.
[221:54.74]120 bucks.

[223:07.11]Hear me out on this.
[223:09.59]I'm just going in naked.
[223:10.41]Because I don't know how to use this weapon.
[223:12.13]I'm just going in naked.
[223:18.89]Fuck it.

[223:49.74]Do you want me to answer the question?

[227:10.74]So what?
[227:12.34]Yeah, let me ask you this.
[227:13.98]What dumb things have you bought over the course of your life?
[227:19.71]I'm sure we all have stuff.
[227:30.92]Bro, guys.
[227:32.28]Bro, guys.
[227:34.02]Bro, guys.
[227:36.06]I was going to say, guys, I'm naked.
[227:38.48]No, I'm not naked anymore.
[227:39.30]Let's go.
[227:39.68]You want to fight?
[227:48.08]See you aiming that bow.
[227:49.14]Oh, I see you aiming that bow.
[227:52.21]Oh, that hurt.
[228:06.02]You got the whole fucking Wizard of Oz behind you.
[228:08.34]Come on, man.
[228:23.95]And that's why we did that.
[228:30.15]See?
[228:32.27]What was that?
[228:34.45]Hold on.
[228:34.81]People were betting when I went in there with a weapon I've never used naked.
[228:39.66]I don't know.
[228:40.14]That was not... Oh.
[228:42.58]That doesn't sound like a sound investment to me.
[228:44.64]Hmm.
[228:46.36]I think that's on the level of Family Guy mobile game purchases, don't you think?
[228:50.84]Hmm.
[229:10.26]Alright, we're going for a real one this time.
[229:28.11]Yeah, I know how much people spend on mobile games.
[229:31.49]I don't think I want to take everything.
[229:37.45]Like, it's always a mistake to do that.
[229:48.92]But we gotta go.
[229:50.10]We gotta go in, right?
[229:51.10]We gotta go all in.
[229:53.38]I have money.
[230:08.23]Yeah, we're going in.
[230:12.75]This is all junk.
[230:14.27]Can I just like delete it or something?
[230:27.36]I, um... I want everybody... I want everyone to raise your hand in here.
[230:33.16]Hold on a minute.
[230:35.15]Let's break this down very quickly.
[230:38.79]How many Hearthstone card packs did you open?
[230:42.29]Get out of here.
[230:43.37]Get out.
[230:43.93]Get out of here.
[230:44.61]Get out.
[230:45.31]Just leave now.
[230:45.79]Get out.
[230:46.31]Get out.
[230:47.97]Get out of here.
[230:48.43]Get out.
[230:54.32]Zero?
[230:54.50]Zero?
[231:01.63]Give me a break.
[231:02.89]I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna get fucking... Do you want to know something funny?
[231:11.22]I... No.
[231:12.56]I may have spent more money.
[231:14.48]No, that's not... Is that true?
[231:19.52]No, I don't think so.
[231:22.48]I don't really spend that much money.
[231:23.76]I really don't.
[231:31.60]Okay, I think I'm ready to go.
[231:32.55]I'm going to take some of the good shit.
[231:38.97]Let me do my perks.
[231:48.18]I kind of like that.
[231:57.94]I've spent over $200 on Pokémon cards.
[232:04.19]Yeah, I... I mean, some of the mobile game stuff is just, like, clicking on a house to collect coins.
[232:12.01]So that's a little different.
[232:20.14]I'm going in.
[232:25.88]I spent over $300 on Planetside 2 cosmetics.
[232:29.65]Yeah, whatever.
[232:30.39]Hey, whatever you... It's...
[232:34.92]Hey, whatever you want to spend your money on, it's up to you.
[232:41.24]You're based?
[232:49.92]Just don't go overboard with everything.
[232:54.06]Buy whatever you want.
[232:55.46]If you've got some money that you want to spend on something, go for it.
[232:59.85]Don't go overboard.
[233:13.20]Yeah, somebody just said it.
[233:16.39]People are acting like I spent 50 grand in the Family Guy fucking mobile game.
[233:35.52]Oh, I gotta get this shit before the... Look, I'm right in the middle.
[233:38.46]So many parties of three are gonna waltz in here.
[233:42.32]I gotta get everything and run away.
[234:06.41]I can't believe you spent $150,000 on the Family Guy mobile game.
[234:13.85]You alright?
[234:14.29]What are you doing?
[234:15.77]Why are you doing that?
[234:16.59]Is everything okay?
[234:19.27]Hey, I told you.
[234:20.11]I knew it.
[234:37.62]You either play with a party, or you get jumped by three people, or you play solo, and you fight the fucking goblin horde and lose.
[234:49.28]Everything's gone.
[235:10.35]At least I still have money.
[235:18.73]You didn't use E?
[235:20.04]That kind of was like not even any time.
[235:21.36]I think I would have died before the heal over time happened.
[235:30.96]That rogue just got right up in my face and was just like, How do I... What do I do about that?
[235:37.93]I feel like I couldn't do anything about that.
[235:40.07]He was just, like, right in my character's character model, just going, stab, stab, stab, stab, stab, dead, dead, dead.
[235:45.23]What do you do?
[235:47.47]Hit him back?
[235:47.95]Alright, just run?
[235:53.44]Just kill.
[235:53.94]I need a fucking mage with him.
[236:27.09]Dude, I cut my finger cooking.
[236:28.17]Any tips?
[236:30.03]Go to the doctor.
[236:30.51]How bad is it?
[236:32.54]If it's bad, go to the doctor.
[236:34.06]Get his stitches or whatever.
[237:26.68]I'm telling you, there's going to be some EVE Online shit with this game when it eventually is done and everything is all ready and everything comes out.
[237:33.43]There are going to be people decked out in all legendary fucking uniques.
[237:39.53]And they're going to lose and it's going to be an EVE Online moment.
[237:46.51]There's going to be one point where you're going to get all decked out and you're going to go into a lobby and you're going to lose everything.
[237:53.14]It's going to be so sad.
[237:55.72]I'm actually kind of happy that I'm not really doing that well.
[237:59.64]And I'm not just keeping that many things because I'm going to get really attached to like a blue or purple.
[238:05.50]And I'm going to literally stare at the wall for an hour if I were to lose it.
[238:16.02]There's a high roller mode for that.
[238:17.96]Yeah.
[238:19.97]100 gold to go in?
[238:20.81]Oh, that sucks.
[238:22.87]Okay, I would definitely watch people do that.
[238:26.47]That's way too scary for me.
[238:27.79]I'm just going to pretend like I don't see this person.
[238:36.53]I'm just trying to get my attention so bad.
[239:10.34]I just saw him, right?
[239:16.50]Wait.
[239:17.08]Oh, are they watching the stream?
[239:19.78]Thank you.
[239:20.20]I appreciate it.
[239:21.45]Watch out for the spiders.
[240:11.31]Hey, do you mind if I get all the jewels?
[240:14.73]Hey, thanks.
[240:16.36]Hey, do you mind if I get all the jewels?
[240:24.20]You know this guy?
[240:42.07]I'm just kidding.
[240:42.59]You can have it.
[240:42.99]I'm kidding.
[240:43.31]I'm kidding.
[240:43.61]I'm kidding.
[240:44.31]I'm kidding.
[240:44.67]Have it.
[240:44.87]You can take it.
[240:45.52]You can have it.
[240:45.90]You can have it.
[240:46.22]You can have it.
[240:46.54]You can have it.
[240:46.96]How do I drop it?
[240:47.46]Dude, I used to play Diablo II.
[240:52.54]I don't fuck around.
[240:55.00]How do I give back?
[240:55.58]Can I just drag it out?
[241:45.62]What's he doing?
[241:46.06]Alright, well, I'm taking it then.
[241:50.59]What's wrong with me?
[241:53.87]Oh.
[241:54.75]Ow.
[241:54.93]I gotta find our way out of here.
[242:17.36]I think this is a different person.
[242:18.48]Alright, let's go loot this shit.
[242:28.58]We're definitely gonna get a portal.
[243:01.84]That's friend, right?
[243:06.34]It can be hard to tell.
[243:07.18]Alright, a portal's here.
[243:08.48]A portal's here.
[243:08.98]I'm gonna go.
[243:13.26]Up, right?
[243:14.08]Up.
[243:14.24]Portals are up.
[243:14.80]Portals are up.
[243:15.36]Portals up.
[243:17.84]Right?
[243:23.79]You need to get out.
[243:24.35]Get out.
[243:24.57]Get out.
[243:24.83]I don't know where.
[243:26.55]Like, where's a portal?
[243:32.47]Down.
[243:33.69]Down.
[243:37.39]I don't see anything.
[243:44.34]Like, wait, wait, wait.
[243:45.40]Do you actually mean that?
[243:46.20]Like, I actually can't see it.
[243:48.34]Where is it?
[243:58.78]I think we're in trouble.
[244:02.95]What do we do?
[244:04.63]What do we do?
[244:06.79]The stone ramp?
[244:09.31]Well, these guys don't know where to go either.
[244:11.17]I just heard something.
[244:15.68]I heard it.
[244:16.14]Where is it?
[244:19.30]Where is it?
[244:23.24]Dude, everything has fucking collision.
[244:25.56]I don't know where to go.
[244:26.30]I just heard something.
[244:28.81]Up the ramp?
[244:30.43]I'm gonna die.
[244:33.87]I think I'm alright.
[244:34.45]Hold on.
[244:35.99]You mean like up here?
[244:36.83]Dude, like this mode.
[244:48.28]Where the fuck are they?
[244:56.52]Why did I wait so long?
[244:58.22]Dude, this level is like 7,000 feet tall.
[245:16.21]Well, okay, I got trapped.
[245:17.25]If you're outside the circle for more than like 10 seconds, you're just dead.
[245:20.11]I thought, I thought they were, alright.
[245:26.62]So, apparently I have this incorrect.
[245:28.94]They do not spawn directly in the middle.
[245:32.40]I thought that it was like they, a ton of them, like two, three of them at the end will spawn right in the middle.
[245:36.64]Right in the middle of the circle.
[245:38.12]Right in the middle.
[245:40.26]That's not what happens?
[245:44.86]Never.
[245:45.42]It's just RNG.
[245:54.36]There's so many up and down in this level.
[245:58.05]How do you reliably know where they are?
[246:04.94]The regular mode is pretty much one level.
[246:10.02]It's not like fucking a ten-story hotel.
[246:29.01]That awful start.
[247:09.11]I might just die and restart.
[247:10.97]I'm poisoned.
[247:11.97]Just kill me.
[247:13.80]This room has like a fucking million people in it.
[247:41.31]I was doing fine.
[247:42.13]I just got somebody said I got so salty.
[247:47.23]I uninstalled laughing my ass off.
[247:51.28]It's kind of par for the course.
[247:52.26]I think don't you think with this game?
[248:02.72]He was laughing his ass off.
[248:27.34]I got so salty I uninstalled laughing my ass off.
[248:55.56]I thought I could kill him in three hits in the head.
[248:56.98]Sorry.
[249:20.29]Okay.
[249:20.95]That's two magic.
[249:37.20]He's already damaged, boys.
[249:38.92]Let's go.
[249:39.66]Come on.
[249:40.57]You're gonna make my confidence go to zero.
[249:44.51]That's pretty good.
[250:00.92]For a mage.
[250:10.39]Ooh.
[250:13.21]Good.
[250:13.58]Okay.
[250:15.44]This is not a horrendous start.
[250:47.36]Somebody here.
[250:50.58]Oh, skeleton.
[251:03.27]Oh, fuck.
[251:44.32]Jerma, just go play slots.
[251:46.68]Now what?
[252:02.10]This is the one.
[252:03.80]This is the one.
[252:05.98]Hey, I have made character progress.
[252:08.02]I have like a hundred bucks.
[252:12.15]Well, I mean, I'll have 25 at the end of this after I, you know, buy a little bit of Family Guy gold.
[252:18.55]I would have just walked into that trap.
[253:07.65]Oh, I completely forgot to play one of the other classes.
[253:12.46]My bad.
[253:12.80]I'll do it after this.
[253:17.86]That's a lot of money.
[253:37.93]The penguin walking.
[253:40.99]Okay.
[253:49.58]You're going to play with some friends at a later date?
[253:53.22]Probably.
[253:53.68]I'm addicted to it.
[254:01.60]I'm addicted to it, even though I can't do it.
[254:38.46]Oh my god, that guy threw a fucking bomb at me!
[254:43.52]What are you gonna do now?
[254:45.24]What are you gonna do now, wizard?
[254:47.24]Dude, your nose got cut off.
[255:19.46]This is such a shitty thing to be in.
[255:26.89]What the fuck?
[255:27.85]He hit me right in the fucking eyes.
[255:29.67]He hit me right in the eyes.
[255:33.59]Is there a hole in the shield?
[256:02.86]What does that sound?
[256:17.78]That was a mistake, wasn't it?
[256:20.16]Oh no, it's these two.
[256:31.75]Power shield on.
[256:32.90]New class, new class.
[256:54.56]Hold on, one more try.
[256:56.40]And I'll switch.
[257:02.07]Trevor, please, I'm losing everything.
[257:06.44]Hey, I got to tell you, this is a casino tip for here.
[257:12.60]If you're at the casino and you're at the roulette table and it's red a hundred times in a row, just bet with the trend.
[257:22.16]You're going to be like, it's going to be black this time.
[257:24.38]No, it's going to be black this time.
[257:26.58]No.
[257:31.99]I think you should bet with the trend at this point.
[257:39.88]That's a fallacy?
[257:40.78]Of course it is.
[257:43.02]All gambling is just a fallacy.
[258:05.10]You missed one?
[258:08.04]Again, he hit me right in the fucking hair.
[258:14.85]No, I'm not fighting this room.
[258:23.67]Boy, this is a lot of stuff that I didn't see.
[258:38.70]If I can pull them individually, it might be alright.
[258:43.06]You have wall hacks.
[258:43.96]Like, how would you even have... Uh-oh.
[259:06.55]There are three more skeletons in here.
[259:58.36]Focusing.
[260:10.65]You're dressed like your character.
[260:12.01]Uh, I am not.
[260:20.99]So that's a pretty decent amount of money.
[260:22.17]Okay, let me just loot.
[260:35.58]Bro, that garb is whack.
[260:42.64]Get rid of this.
[260:50.79]Get rid of this too.
[260:51.61]Get rid of all of this.
[260:56.87]Okay.
[260:58.99]Now find a portal and leave.
[261:00.67]I don't think they even spawned in yet.
[261:17.84]Okay.
[261:21.02]Clean this up.
[261:37.41]There it is.
[261:38.97]I'm going to mess somebody up with that.
[262:08.33]God, this is- it's such like an interesting PvP PvE PvP PvP.
[262:40.59]Okay, decent shield.
[262:46.05]Bunch of junk.
[263:08.37]Bunch of junk.
[263:10.55]Alright, there's a portal.
[263:14.03]You alone?
[263:15.65]You're not alone.
[263:16.25]Goodbye.
[263:16.51]I hope nobody saw me.
[263:24.99]Oh fuck.
[263:25.81]Oh my god.
[263:35.88]Fuck off!
[263:36.30]Wait, are we fighting?
[263:43.31]non-hostile They were kind of standing around for a second It was a full three or four seconds that I was like wait a minute I I didn't hope they were like stream friends, or you know what I mean.
[264:07.04]I didn't I
[264:11.44]Alright, but let me ask the believer of something.
[264:15.78]I can't fight three people.
[264:23.55]Are we fighting?
[264:24.43]I know.
[264:25.29]Whatever.
[264:25.71]I went into this room.
[264:31.53]I thought I turned the light off.
[264:34.05]They all just barreled into the room.
[264:38.01]I could have probably thrown down.
[264:39.81]No, I was just stuck.
[264:40.62]It was over.
[264:43.36]The mage is just enchanting fire sword on the barbarian.
[264:46.96]And you got a monk doing something else.
[264:51.35]Some type of shield buff.
[264:52.65]I don't know.
[264:53.11]I'm just a guy with a fucking bottle of liquor.
[264:59.06]And a lighter.
[265:03.08]New class.
[265:03.52]I'll do it after this.
[265:23.73]This is what it feels like to root for a losing sports team.
[265:27.39]Yeah, but eventually they're going to win the World Series.
[265:34.91]And you're going to be so happy when they do.
[265:37.27]It just might take 70 or 80 years.
[265:56.74]Yeah, but that's also not a fair analogy, considering... Okay, it would be like if I was playing a basketball game, and I was the only player versus a whole team.
[266:08.10]They're, like, passing the ball back and forth, they're, like, slapping five, and I'm running around in circles.
[266:30.75]When is that stream?
[266:34.27]Do you guys think that if I hired a professional basketball team to just go just versus me only, would I score one point in a full regulation game?
[266:45.36]What do you think?
[266:54.30]I didn't even... What was that?
[267:04.08]No.
[267:04.94]You don't think so?
[267:06.96]I think I would do it.
[267:07.66]I think I could actually do it.
[267:14.70]Scoring one basket?
[267:24.23]Aren't you just seeing in your head a team of, like, seven-foot-tall basketball players and me as, like, 5'8 Andy?
[267:32.74]I would go to shoot the ball, and they would just absolutely just spike it down.
[267:38.66]Yeah, I would have to get a foul shot.
[267:42.65]I would have to get fouled.
[267:45.23]I would just be flopping, you know what I mean?
[267:47.71]Somebody would get a little, I would run up and go for a dunk, and I would flop and be like, oh, oh!
[267:54.60]Wow!
[267:56.32]That was too hard!
[267:57.72]And then I get a chance.
[268:05.85]You're 5'8 with shoes.
[268:07.13]You don't think I'll be wearing shoes?
[268:08.29]I'll be wearing, like, basketball shoes.
[268:26.80]What?
[268:27.98]Um, no.
[268:29.48]No, that doesn't count either.
[268:30.46]I want that health back.
[268:32.98]I'm gonna wait.
[268:34.42]I'm gonna wait till that health is back.
[268:39.47]I'm waiting.
[268:40.05]I'm gonna wait till it's back.
[268:47.80]It's going in the review.
[269:18.43]I can't even leave.
[269:21.66]Do you think if I just stand here, somebody will eventually walk by?
[269:23.96]Like, what if I'm just a prisoner?
[269:31.87]Just RPing as a prisoner?
[269:47.82]I tell you, being locked in here all this time, I just wish somebody would come and rescue me or something.
[269:57.44]Oi!
[269:58.76]Anybody out there?
[270:02.66]Yeah, doesn't sound like it.

[270:41.86]There's no way out, mate.
[270:47.48]I tried that already.
[270:48.75]They gave me a torch and that's all they gave me.
[270:50.93]You got any of you got a key or anything to get me out of here?
[270:57.81]Oh, don't just walk away from me.

[271:50.05]Oh, I forgot about the coin!
[271:51.17]There you go, mate.
[271:55.09]Ten coins, split it up over you one.
[271:57.41]He's screaming back to jail.
[272:00.23]What happened?
[272:05.61]I dropped a few coins for you there on the ground for letting me out of there.
[272:08.42]I was stuck in there a long time, mate.
[272:09.88]You know how long I was in there for?
[272:11.26]Seven years.
[272:16.42]Oh, wait!
[272:18.35]Me mate George, is he still alive?
[272:21.15]No, no, he's gone.
[272:23.29]Probably died a long time ago.
[272:28.49]They replaced him with a chest.
[272:32.55]I don't want that junk.
[272:40.32]What do you do for a living?
[272:46.10]I was a thief.
[272:48.69]Hey, and I killed.
[272:53.37]I killed too.
[272:54.65]I killed.
[272:55.07]In case you were wondering.
[273:02.04]My name's Martin by the way.
[273:03.58]Martin.
[273:06.04]How are you?
[273:06.50]Thank you.
[273:07.88]What was that?
[273:08.28]Something felt kind of hot.
[273:10.36]Alright boys, we've got a fight here.
[273:15.60]It's just a mage, not a big deal.
[273:21.17]Don't worry, I'm going in.
[273:23.81]Ah, fire.
[273:27.97]That's how you get through that door.
[273:31.54]Sorry, mate.
[273:32.46]Just trying to get a little bit of extra coin while we have a few spare moments.
[273:37.92]Except for that trap, mate.
[273:45.73]I don't know where he went.
[273:50.51]Yep, yep.
[273:51.35]Oh, I know what that means, mate.
[273:52.57]I know exactly what that means.
[273:53.67]Don't you?
[273:55.69]How'd you find yourself locked up in there?
[274:06.56]Yeah, the mayor didn't like me very much.
[274:12.43]I'm from a small town.
[274:15.53]Accidentally, I burned his house down.
[274:20.29]Didn't really mean to.
[274:21.27]It was kind of a misunderstanding.
[274:29.52]I got tried.
[274:30.42]They wanted to hang me, and then a bunch of zombies entered.
[274:34.20]What's that, mate?
[274:37.49]Oh.
[274:37.73]Why don't you look at that?
[274:42.17]Heavy gauntlets, gem necklace, pearl necklace, blue sapphire, a bandage of some kind, I don't know, whatever that is, and some of that and some of this, a little bit of extra this, a little bit of gold.
[274:55.71]Do you want anything on you?
[274:56.63]Yeah.
[275:04.82]Other way, mate.
[275:07.08]I forgot to tell you.
[275:08.94]I'm a backstabbing cheat.
[275:26.75]Sorry, sorry, sorry mate.
[275:28.40]I'm on a roll of drugs.
[275:38.41]Shit.
[275:40.45]Oh god damn it.
[276:03.23]Holy shit, you're a jester.
[276:04.47]You started using a funny voice and your survival rate skyrocketed.
[276:08.57]He said, Peaky Blinders.
[276:32.48]Alright, let me get another one in.
[276:33.98]Can I get another real dry one in?
[276:38.04]Last words, yeah.
[276:46.29]Class, yes.
[276:46.87]Alright, class, class, class, class.

[277:50.43]Oh, it resets every time.
[277:51.61]Okay.
[277:51.71]I don't even know how to play with the wizard.
[277:56.47]We're just going to walk around.
[278:02.36]So I have a staff.
[278:07.56]You have to stand still when using spells.
[278:09.20]Okay.
[278:09.34]Okay.
[278:20.73]It never turned on.
[278:21.45]They couldn't hear you.
[278:22.15]Yeah, they could.
[278:22.87]There was a little indicator down the lower left.
[278:25.88]Yeah, they were like, they were answering questions.
[278:29.36]Did it do a wizard voice?
[278:31.96]Um... Hold on.
[278:38.19]Alright, let me see here.
[278:39.27]So... This is a swing.

[279:17.12]Maybe in a minute.
[279:18.60]Does the... The mage does not have a torch.
[279:21.97]Oh, yeah, they do.
[279:22.49]What the hell's going on?
[279:52.22]Okay.
[279:53.56]I can't wear any of this.
[279:59.14]You know, just throw one down.
[280:00.10]Easier that way.
[280:12.91]Ooh, what's that?
[280:13.85]Ancient scroll.
[280:14.49]I thought it was a wizard thing.
[280:43.57]Am I doing this wrong?
[280:48.20]A wizard battle.
[281:03.72]That's actually really fun.
[281:29.54]What happens if you run out of spells?
[281:45.69]Oh, that hurts me.
[281:47.89]Oh, this is a trial run.
[281:48.83]This is a trial run.
[282:25.59]I'm using everything I have here.
[282:33.79]Hey!
[282:47.34]Slow.
[282:55.63]I'm in trouble now.
[283:09.69]Is there a heal?
[283:10.91]Oh, that's the other caster.
[283:21.26]What does haste do?
[283:24.74]Am I faster?
[283:25.48]I can't really tell.
[283:32.51]You meditate to recharge?
[283:35.75]Is that a certain button combination?
[283:41.61]Oh.
[283:45.65]Really vulnerable here.
[283:47.33]Really vulnerable.
[283:59.86]Oh, it's only one recharge.
[284:28.53]Do headshots matter with that or no?
[284:36.72]They do.
[284:37.18]Oh.
[284:40.88]That's pretty pog.
[285:00.39]Blue with the big chest?
[285:01.17]I don't think I can.
[285:13.33]Nope.
[285:23.15]Oh, that's a blue.
[285:26.89]Fuck.
[285:30.69]Alright, I'm just going to try to get out.
[285:31.78]I'm just going to try to survive.
[285:32.70]Okay, the goal is just try to get the hell out of here.
[285:38.70]I don't know.
[286:00.60]Alright.
[286:01.58]Portal.
[286:02.38]Get me out.
[286:03.82]Oh, fuck!
[286:08.84]Don't mind me!
[286:12.81]I'm not sure they saw me.
[286:18.45]Get me out.
[286:19.57]Get me out.
[286:19.93]Just get me out.
[286:42.38]I'm just running around looking for rooms.
[286:43.80]Looking for portal.
[286:51.31]Oh, I feel like there's one in here.
[286:52.73]Oh, I feel like there's one in here.
[286:58.29]Oh, okay.
[286:59.41]Okay.
[287:00.52]Shh.
[287:08.78]Thank God.
[287:09.88]Got a blue.
[287:15.75]I didn't even see what it was.
[287:16.89]Was it a ranger?
[287:17.47]15 armor.
[287:21.60]Plus 2 magical heal.
[287:24.48]Wait, I can wear it?
[287:25.70]No, I can't.
[287:28.58]So, okay.
[287:30.38]If you find a good item like this for another class...
[287:40.35]I can't, it's not a shared stash, but I can trade it to myself or just trade it.
[287:54.88]You trading posted to others.
[287:57.42]Do not sell blues to NPCs, trade them to the other players in the market.
[288:01.99]Really?
[288:04.95]Dude, that's so cool.
[288:12.03]That's so cool.
[288:20.48]I'm gonna fill my inventory with blues.
[288:23.62]And I'm gonna sit in the fucking trade server.
[288:30.04]And just drink like six Mountain Dews.
[288:32.65]And just trade like hats for refined and shit.
[288:38.95]Alright, made it out alive.
[288:55.11]Here we go.
[289:11.66]All this other stuff is kind of trunk.
[289:16.08]Trunk?
[289:17.72]Trash and junk combined.
[289:35.15]Are there other spells besides the one... Are there more spells?
[289:57.54]This is the coolest part of this whole game, by the way.
[290:12.18]But this is by far the coolest thing.
[290:20.08]The menus.
[290:20.86]Yeah.
[290:24.76]Alright, let me look at my spell.
[290:32.51]What is this?
[290:34.63]Tear was zap?
[290:37.53]Wait, what is this?
[290:38.47]I don't get it.
[290:40.17]Ignite?
[290:48.64]skill one skill two spell memory priority you can have two sets of spells equipped but it sucks so just keep it on this keep it on one
[291:17.98]Oh, I see.
[291:18.45]The cost limit.
[291:25.49]Actually, haste is good for trying to run around and fight and stuff.
[291:27.70]I'll get rid of... I just want all offense.
[291:29.30]I'll try zap.
[291:39.05]Magic damage bonus.
[291:48.50]Melt.
[291:52.42]Oh, I want, yeah, this for sure.
[291:56.26]20% cast speed.
[291:59.40]Hell yeah.
[292:00.42]Can I get a hell yeah in the chat, please?
[292:01.74]Alright, let's keep going.
[292:07.12]We made some money.
[292:23.78]That's cool.
[292:29.56]Hell yeah.
[292:38.89]Are you addicted yet?
[292:39.75]I've been addicted since probably the first hour.
[292:44.90]This game does this thing... Where... It lets you keep stuff.
[292:51.38]And there's rarities...
[292:54.80]It's just kind of scratched that itch for a ton of people.
[293:04.78]Addicted but bad.
[293:05.72]Hey, where does it say that you have to be good at a game like this to enjoy it?
[293:12.48]I've done okay.
[293:18.33]I didn't mean to do that.
[293:22.55]You're not allowed to make fun of me.
[293:23.61]It's my stream.
[293:36.32]Does that count as a spell?
[293:37.45]This wizard sucks.
[294:12.35]Dude, you kinda stink at this.
[294:33.94]Jesus, somebody die!
[294:56.11]Holy shit, that was a weird 3D movie.
[295:00.21]I'm dead.
[295:01.74]Um... Okay, so... That takes a lot to kill things.
[295:30.75]If I had voice chat on, I was going to be like, don't fucking do that.
[295:35.30]Some of us are trying to look at our menus and we don't want sounds to be in our ears.
[295:39.92]Don't fucking do that.
[295:40.72]That's BM.
[295:46.41]Mage is PvP.
[296:01.23]Do some more RP.
[296:03.65]Alright, fine.
[296:11.59]Oh... Oh, goodness me.
[296:17.28]Oh, if I say so myself, I seem to be stuck in this wild world of monsters and demons and goblins and... Oh, dear.
[296:34.60]Let me just find a way out of here.
[296:37.02]The circle of hell, it seems.
[296:39.32]Oof!
[296:46.74]Ow!
[296:47.28]Bastard!
[296:49.39]Oof!
[296:52.41]Ow!
[296:54.09]Oh, dear!
[296:56.11]Hold on, let me cast a... He's already gone.
[296:58.81]Never mind.
[297:04.50]That's all you hear.
[297:09.94]I'll try it again.
[297:10.74]Fuck.
[297:13.28]All he heard was, oh me, oh dear, oh my, all these demons of me.
[297:18.04]And that guy's just gone.
[297:20.44]Most short-lived wizard.
[297:31.65]Hmm.
[297:38.83]What was his name?
[297:39.81]We didn't even get a chance to do that.
[297:41.29]He died too quickly.
[297:57.36]Scrumple.
[298:04.36]Scrumple Stillskin?
[298:07.14]Oh!
[298:08.06]Oh my goodness!
[298:10.24]Oh!
[298:13.16]This confounded door!
[298:18.94]Is anyone out there?
[298:35.01]Jeez!
[298:49.16]There ain't anybody around yet.
[298:50.16]That's fine.
[298:50.62]I'm just warming up.
[298:55.47]Ah!
[298:58.59]Oh, dear.
[299:00.05]Oh, me.
[299:01.45]Oh, goodness gracious.
[299:03.47]Oh.
[299:05.85]Can you... Anyone out there?
[299:07.81]Is anyone out there?
[299:10.07]Is anyone out there?
[299:12.24]Could help the great Kenneth Haight?
[299:15.86]Oh, a tree!
[299:17.40]Grant me... I'm not even fucking... My audio's not even on.
[299:21.77]What?
[299:26.33]Why am I muted?
[299:35.41]Oh!
[299:37.05]Oh, that was a... He took a chunk out of me, it seems!
[299:46.43]Oh my goodness!
[299:48.01]Adventurer, please, if you could lend me a small hand.
[299:50.97]I'm being chased by demons and ghouls and goblins and they're following me in.
[299:56.07]Be careful over there.
[299:58.81]Oh dear.
[300:01.07]The life of an adventurer sure is full of wonder.
[300:05.81]Watch out!
[300:07.45]Let me...
[300:08.76]Accidentally aggro'd the entire room!
[300:11.14]Whoops-a-daisy!
[300:12.58]Let me just find a way, if you'd adventure, if you'd please, please come back over here!
[300:22.70]Oh no!
[300:25.12]More death!
[300:26.32]More death and destruction in this vile world!
[300:30.61]Ha!
[300:36.49]Seems to be my last stand.
[300:48.28]Boy, you will never defeat me, you vile, disgusting future demons.
[301:05.86]Found my way out of there.
[301:07.04]That was very terrifying.
[301:09.92]Goodness!
[301:21.91]I need some type of healing potion or something like that.
[301:26.36]If anybody can hear me, I'm just a lonely wizard.
[301:30.68]I'm not muted.
[301:47.33]Look at the bottom left.
[302:09.70]Oh dear.
[302:12.56]Need some potions or mana.
[302:15.82]I seem to be running out.
[302:17.06]These are nice wizard shoes.
[302:30.93]Ah.
[302:32.09]Oops.
[302:36.56]Oh, dear.
[302:38.30]Adventurer!
[302:39.96]Oh!
[302:40.74]If you have a potion or two, I'll tell the skeleton behind you.
[302:44.12]There's a skeleton here.
[302:45.80]Oh, my goodness gravy.
[302:51.77]I could help.
[302:54.85]I could help you.
[302:56.96]Let us work together.
[302:58.06]I'm just a lonely mage trying to find... Watch out for the skeleton!
[303:02.46]Oh!
[303:04.16]Fiddlesticks.
[303:04.83]Hey adventurer, I know a few tricks.
[303:18.98]Little faster now, aren't we?
[303:23.33]Now, I believe there is a gigantic diamond hidden in this cave somewhere.
[303:30.77]I saw it one time 25 years ago.
[303:42.30]Here, let me help you out with a little more haste.
[303:48.96]Let us go!
[303:55.71]Back up, adventurer!
[303:57.05]Fireball incoming!
[304:01.25]Hey!
[304:02.29]Nice swing!
[304:06.14]Another fireball coming out here!
[304:15.54]Excellent work!
[304:16.38]You sure do know how to use a sword!
[304:21.42]I know quite a few people that would be very interested in how you are using that weapon.
[304:27.44]I'm from the Adventurers Guild.
[304:31.27]Up north.
[304:33.29]Very far north.
[304:36.65]It's very chilly where I'm from.
[304:38.91]As you can see, I'm wearing all these robes.
[304:49.01]Down here!
[304:50.61]And close that door.
[304:54.01]We wouldn't want anybody to be sneaking up on us.
[304:56.81]What is your name?
[304:58.95]Ah.
[305:00.83]Mike.
[305:05.23]I'll get this one.
[305:08.87]Would you mind if I meditated for just one moment, please? ...
[305:23.66]Ah.
[305:25.17]Refreshing.
[305:30.95]Adventurer, this is probably a bad way to go.
[305:34.01]Ow, my skin hurts.
[305:41.38]Yes, yes, of course we need to go this way.
[305:43.06]All the way.
[305:47.13]Looking for a diamond, a crown, made out of jewels, emeralds, rubies.
[305:56.25]Adventurer, have you ever held a ruby before in your hands?
[306:04.72]Oh, my goodness.
[306:07.30]You've had it the whole time!
[306:09.08]By gravy!
[306:14.32]Well, now we can leave.
[306:15.30]I don't need to stay here any longer.
[306:18.92]Not exactly what I was looking for.
[306:20.30]I do feel awful, though.
[306:28.08]Make sure I have Apollo's spell.
[306:30.64]Adventurer, where did you go?
[306:32.74]Adventurer?
[306:36.66]I might have something for you, Adventurer.
[306:38.76]Holy sh... Oh, this is... Adventurer, I'm going to give you something, and I want you to make sure you understand this is a very expensive item.
[306:46.47]And that's what you get for being on my team.
[306:59.73]Adventure up!
[307:01.43]This way!
[307:01.83]If you see a portal by any chance, please let me know.
[307:13.99]I'm so old.
[307:15.95]I should be the one to go first.
[307:19.83]Yes, of course.
[307:21.15]What a nice young man you really are.
[307:30.64]Oh, they think that they can use magic on us, don't they?
[307:39.30]How does that sound?
[308:02.44]I hope he gets out with that blue.
[308:03.58]I really do.
[308:07.76]Quest failed.
[308:09.77]That guy fucking hated you.
[308:11.49]I don't think so.
[308:13.39]He's got a blue.
[308:14.25]He's got a blue.
[308:15.25]He's getting out of there.
[308:15.97]Alright.
[308:23.53]One more RP and then I'm gonna go back to playing.
[308:31.77]This time I'm going to be a dark wizard.
[308:44.85]Well, that's when you turn it off.
[308:52.68]That's when you turn it off.
[309:24.27]Well, let's play Unfortunate Fireball What is the range for this to actually hurt me?
[309:40.56]Am I in a cell?
[309:41.58]Oh my goodness, I went into a cell!
[309:45.06]How did I back into a cell?
[309:48.34]What was that?
[309:49.00]I didn't hit a fly?
[310:13.41]It looks like it was off.
[310:21.66]That's pretty good stuff.
[310:39.45]Is there a heal?
[310:40.21]Wait, this is... Oh, this is a heal.
[310:42.58]Is it a full heal?
[310:45.56]Oh.
[310:47.00]What just happened?
[310:50.14]Did somebody kill me?
[310:52.42]What is that?
[310:57.62]Did I kill... Did I just kill myself?
[310:59.82]Because of the magic missile?
[311:01.10]Oh.
[311:02.90]Oh, dear.
[311:04.76]Oops.
[311:05.54]Accidentally magic missile to ground.
[311:07.26]Oops.
[311:07.98]Oops.
[311:17.27]Alright, this one's for real.
[311:20.83]Let me try... Hold on.
[311:22.55]Let me try the ranger.
[311:29.28]I feel like the wizard is really, really awesome.
[311:33.04]But I think you really have... I think you need to be like a little more familiar with the whole game.
[311:44.79]Ranger.
[311:45.01]Ranger.
[311:46.82]Ranger.
[311:52.38]It seems really cool though.
[311:53.52]It seems like the kit is really fun.
[312:04.80]Yeah.
[312:06.02]Ranger.
[312:08.01]Oh.
[312:09.31]Ranger 3.
[312:10.07]So how does this work?
[312:26.99]Detect recent enemy footsteps.
[312:28.87]That's cool.
[312:31.93]Forge food?
[312:32.85]Flight speed projectiles are greatly increased.
[312:38.86]In addition, physical attack powers increase.
[312:40.28]Okay, that's cool.
[312:45.54]That's pretty good.
[312:51.02]That's pretty good, too.
[313:01.16]15% more headshot damage.
[313:06.26]I'll try that.
[313:18.29]What's the loadout?
[313:25.43]It's a bow.
[313:25.91]Alright, let me try it.
[313:32.15]The multi-shot one is super good.
[313:36.73]How does it work?
[313:37.39]I get six shots.
[313:39.75]You hold it.
[313:40.23]There's a lot of drop on it, though.
[313:43.21]Okay, that's a lot of drop.
[313:46.79]I gotta be ready for that.
[313:58.88]Range of voice?
[314:02.11]Probably something like this.
[314:08.21]If I were to say... Something like this.
[314:13.37]Huh.
[314:17.57]You think you're so powerful, waving around that two-handed axe.
[314:23.96]Okay, I don't like this one.
[314:32.54]Why am I in the vents?
[314:35.50]I don't have a melee weapon, do I?
[314:36.68]Did I just eat wood off the ground?
[314:42.95]Oh, that... Okay, oops.
[314:52.66]How do I get out of here?
[315:08.31]Do you have infinite arrows?
[315:26.21]Oh, fuck you.
[315:28.93]Oh!
[315:35.45]Oh!
[315:40.53]I kinda like it.
[315:45.94]It's kinda fun.
[316:09.65]Can I break this with arrows?
[316:14.56]I can.
[316:14.88]Okay.
[316:25.77]Another pick lock.
[316:29.31]I don't seem to have any close range.
[316:33.07]This one's open.
[316:38.24]Pretty good.
[316:40.08]Okay.
[316:40.32]You can get a sword.
[316:45.66]Maybe I'll try it out.
[316:59.11]Walk over here.
[317:13.79]Wizard shoes?
[317:45.03]Get him!
[317:46.43]Ah!
[317:49.67]Ah!
[317:58.07]Uh-oh!
[318:12.48]Time to go.
[318:30.00]Ulster the bow to go faster.
[318:31.14]Uh-oh.
[318:48.09]No.
[318:49.65]I want that chest.
[319:00.52]Oh, never mind goodbye.
[319:07.85]So the sacrificial altar, what do you do?
[319:12.71]What is that?
[319:24.72]Oh no, this is bad.
[319:26.40]I'm in a lot of trouble here.
[319:27.25]I gotta I gotta just drag them this way.
[319:41.35]Get away.
[319:42.27]It's a teammate revive.
[319:49.28]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[319:49.96]Okay, cool.
[319:53.32]Holy shit.
[319:54.22]Just run.
[319:55.20]What is that?
[319:55.62]I don't know.
[319:58.52]I'm dead.
[320:01.32]There was like a thousand.
[320:02.68]There was so much shit.
[320:03.76]I'm dead.
[320:04.24]Yeah, goodbye.
[320:09.46]There's like a thousand spiders in that room.
[320:14.69]There's just so many people.
[320:15.99]There's so many things.
[320:22.05]Close the door behind you.
[320:23.03]Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[320:30.37]Honestly, I just trying to get used to how to shoot the bow.
[320:48.73]Triple shots, amazing.
[320:54.03]I just gotta land some headshots on some people.
[321:04.18]Oh, I want some garlic bread.
[321:09.02]Um...
[321:13.03]You know what's really weird?
[321:14.59]And I've never said this out loud.
[321:16.29]I don't think anyone's ever heard me say this.
[321:17.95]You know what?
[321:18.55]I want a steak.
[321:20.71]Is that weird?
[321:21.25]I want a steak right now.
[321:29.10]I haven't eaten a steak.
[321:33.70]I mean, when we're talking about like a fork and knife, I want a steak.
[321:38.54]Like, shh, steak.
[321:42.13]I think it's been probably 10 to 15 years since I've said that.
[321:44.92]I don't really eat steak.
[321:50.58]Yeah, I'm not sure what put me in a steak mood.
[322:04.43]Yeah, no, it's been probably at least 10 years since I've wanted to eat a steak.
[322:26.49]I guess I could just sit up here and just sniper.
[322:42.40]Oh, that's good, but I'm going to have to wait.
[322:54.20]I was saying it a lot last night.
[323:00.49]Because I turn a cylinder.
[323:03.91]Yeah, you're right.
[323:06.43]Alright, you look ridiculous.
[323:14.00]Can you die already?
[323:18.58]Have you got low iron?
[323:19.96]Hmm.
[323:21.43]That's an interesting theory.
[323:47.44]What's the netcode like on this?
[323:49.18]How much should I lead people?
[324:04.54]Pregnant cravings.
[324:07.58]Um, no.
[324:08.57]Pregnant craving would be if I were to say I want a steak, but I want you to marinate it in Cool Whip first.
[324:30.20]Are they together?
[324:30.64]Who are you shooting at?
[324:32.84]Who are you shooting at?
[324:34.49]Are you shooting at me?
[324:38.05]Yep.
[324:49.32]Shit.
[324:50.34]Shit.
[324:57.70]Oh, god damn it.
[325:04.17]Okay, so people are fighting?
[325:06.88]It's... I think one's dead?
[325:09.56]Oh, you're coming after me, aren't you?
[325:20.30]I don't know how I survived that.
[325:23.28]I really don't.
[325:27.68]I got no arrows.
[325:28.54]I'm in trouble here.
[325:29.24]Yeah.
[325:36.27]No, this is not getting out of that.
[325:40.47]Too bad.
[325:49.21]I mean, honestly, you should have just started killing the stuff.
[325:52.59]We were both dead.
[325:53.29]It was like four or five enemies behind like right next to us.
[326:07.32]First PvP kill of the night.
[326:08.90]Well, that's not true.
[326:14.98]That would be... Oh, I don't know how I'd feel about that if that was an accurate statement.
[326:20.58]That's at least the third or fourth PvP kill of the night.
[326:31.62]At least five.
[326:42.48]I missed some raids, didn't I?
[326:44.10]Shit.
[326:46.94]Honey Goblin came in with a raid.
[326:48.42]Honey Goblin raided last night, too, the night before, right?
[326:51.91]If you're still here from that raid, which, see, I think that was hours ago.
[326:56.71]Thank you.
[326:59.15]Sorry I caught it, like, three and a half hours late.
[327:10.04]You did not hit me with that.
[327:13.73]What?
[327:15.05]Is it going for your wing?
[327:16.13]That's horse shit.
[327:23.88]Dude, why are there so many of you?
[327:28.92]Honest to goodness.
[327:30.60]What the hell?
[327:31.68]I know, I'm supposed to close that door.
[327:33.60]But I had to... What's going on?
[327:45.71]Okay, I'm fine.
[327:47.70]It's a little sloppy, but whatever.
[328:20.69]Something's going on.
[328:30.08]Footsteps.
[328:44.20]Welcome to Oz!
[328:45.24]Right in the face.
[328:45.86]A wonderful world of Oz!
[329:12.76]That class seems unbelievably good.
[329:38.68]Rogue has a hard time with mobs.
[329:45.19]Ranger's not a solo class.
[329:46.37]I probably shouldn't be playing it then.
[330:01.02]I think the fighter is probably the class.
[330:02.46]I could try Barbarian.
[330:03.32]I feel like that would be my speed.
[330:06.33]Just big, heavy swing, hit head.
[330:13.48]P-break?
[330:14.22]Um, I'll probably... I want to keep playing, but... It is getting kind of late.
[330:27.30]I want to get out one more time.
[330:29.44]I want to escape one more time.
[330:56.68]What?
[330:58.77]What?
[330:59.11]Shoot?
[331:43.46]Oh, fuck.
[332:04.07]It's terrifying.
[332:15.78]Oh shit, somebody's here.
[332:16.93]Gotta go!
[332:51.55]Just in case somebody follows me down here.
[333:02.15]Uh, somebody's asking if there is a proper solo queue.
[333:04.27]There is.
[333:05.97]There is a solo mode now.
[333:11.25]It's very, very hectic.
[333:14.63]It's very scary.
[333:24.75]I would say it's very difficult.
[333:27.35]But that's the game.
[333:29.09]That's the way that gets the name of the game.
[333:30.63]It's not called easy and easier.
[333:36.56]It's called fucking hard and harder.
[334:00.40]Please let me loot these chests in peace.
[334:03.34]Please.
[334:06.49]Okay.
[334:07.91]I'm still alive.
[334:08.69]That's a good thing.
[334:12.57]15.
[334:12.59]Oh, that's awful.
[334:14.29]Wait, is it faster?
[334:31.80]Seven bow.
[334:32.60]Oh, seven.
[334:33.22]Okay.
[334:33.94]I'll try it.
[334:35.78]That damage is pretty bad though.
[334:41.51]I'm sick.
[334:41.95]I got to go to bed.
[334:42.63]I hope you feel better.
[334:43.33]Oh, this is bad.
[334:50.40]Yeah, I'm in trouble.
[335:03.23]Wrapping around.
[335:04.00]Give me a good bow.
[335:15.48]Give me a blue bow.
[335:42.20]29.
[335:45.68]Better.
[335:50.06]Oh my god, I thought I had an extra second.
[336:02.51]Alright, give me a portal.
[336:03.25]Get me out of here.
[336:19.37]There is a person portal.
[336:27.91]That's way too... That room is way too dangerous.
[336:44.50]Oh shit.
[336:48.90]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[336:49.54]I don't think I have any potions or anything, do I?
[337:05.90]Could be worse.
[337:21.55]This is a good stream.
[337:24.43]I'm glad you think so.
[337:28.89]The game is very, very fun.
[337:33.16]This is going to be one of those games, I think, that it's going to have a lot of fans.
[337:40.35]There's going to be a lot of people that are going to be playing this.
[337:43.71]Very frequently.
[337:44.51]Very frequently.
[338:00.21]Oh, that's not good.
[338:03.53]Oh, fuck.
[338:04.07]I'm just gonna go.
[338:04.63]Hmm.
[338:16.40]Oh.
[338:16.56]Very bad everywhere.
[338:17.62]Just leave.
[338:20.13]Is another archer here?
[338:20.89]Oh, yeah.
[338:31.33]Come on.
[338:33.05]There's a portal somewhere.
[338:33.79]I don't really have very much.
[338:34.61]I have some jewels.
[338:36.01]I have some stuff.
[338:58.55]Crouch.
[339:19.60]Did I step in my own trap?
[339:22.22]What just happened?
[339:27.71]I didn't know you could do that.
[339:29.37]I didn't know you could do that.
[339:30.55]I thought it was like, it's mine, so therefore the game doesn't... I didn't know you could do that.
[339:40.62]I thought it was mine.
[339:49.03]Yeah, and I even still tried to jump over it.
[339:51.23]Alright, it's a fun class, but I feel like it's a class where you need to have, like, support.
[340:00.28]Okay.
[340:02.10]I'm gonna try Barbarian for two times.
[340:26.45]co-op with somebody um that'll be probably something that has to be planned because it's um it's very very late around almost the whole world so I think that's something that hey you want to do this on Thursday or something right I think that's gotta plan it up a little
[340:55.01]It's 6pm in Australia.
[340:57.62]Hey, hey, one's in chat if you're from Australia.
[341:00.88]Where are my Australian friends at?
[341:07.20]That's a lot, wow.
[341:07.96]Okay, I get it.
[341:24.30]I feel it.
[341:27.67]Is there a different swing?
[341:28.31]There's a sideways swing.
[341:40.10]Oh, get out of here.
[341:40.92]This is a really bad place to spawn.
[342:00.83]Yeah, a lot of the, um, it's a lot of people that are around right now.
[342:04.62]It's a lot of, um, Australia, Asia too, right?
[342:23.70]New Zealand?
[342:24.50]Yep.
[342:25.50]Some, yeah, Europe too, because Europe's probably waking up right now.
[342:32.39]I like the late night crowd.
[342:34.86]You guys have been really, really... Not like... Don't get me wrong.
[342:53.70]Uh, like I said, don't get me wrong.
[342:56.68]Um, every time zone has, uh, you know, this, this perks to every time zone.
[343:04.79]Well, this is the first time I've ever streamed like this.
[343:08.55]Somebody's coming.
[343:14.20]Oh, okay.
[343:15.04]Yep.
[343:15.76]Ow.
[343:17.18]You got it.
[343:26.56]Yep.
[343:27.94]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[343:30.84]You lied to me.
[343:31.88]You lied to me.
[343:33.34]That is the, that is B, wait, is this a different person?
[343:37.11]Why did you lie?
[343:37.93]Why would you lie to me?
[343:39.03]You're the, oh, why would you do this to me?
[343:41.45]Why would you do this to me?
[343:44.79]Traitor.
[343:47.07]Traitor.
[343:49.17]What the heck?
[343:50.21]You lied to me.
[343:51.43]You did the squat squat.
[343:57.71]Got lied to.
[344:00.01]Was it a different guy?
[344:00.79]They looked like they were together.
[344:02.25]He was waiting for backup.
[344:15.06]Bunch of bastards, I'm telling you.
[344:18.88]Two man party, only one was friendly.
[344:29.84]Would you ever visit Australia?
[344:32.95]Australia seems like equal parts one of the most beautiful, remarkable places on Earth while also being one of the most terrifying places I would never want to go.
[344:53.08]Like, I would want to experience Australia in a helicopter.
[344:57.24]You know what I mean?
[345:00.11]Like, holy shit.
[345:00.87]Wow.
[345:01.21]Look at this.
[345:01.69]Look at how amazing this is.
[345:03.69]This is so beautiful.
[345:08.81]Don't land.
[345:09.19]Don't land though.
[345:09.97]Don't land.
[345:10.43]Uh, here there are spiders as big as two fists.
[345:13.87]I thought we could fly over it.
[345:25.42]Ow.
[345:30.09]Is there a parry?
[345:31.65]Or no, is it just power?
[345:48.40]All jokes aside, though, I would, I would, it's definitely on the bucket list of places that are interesting to me.
[346:03.22]Dude, you got a really wide swing.
[346:04.72]Damn.
[346:11.88]Maybe Barbarian's not for me.
[346:45.64]This is a little harder than I thought it was going to be.
[346:58.21]Japan's another one.
[346:58.93]A lot of places in Europe too.
[347:02.69]You guys know I've never left.
[347:04.71]I've never left North America.
[347:07.70]For like any reason.
[347:08.46]Ever.
[347:13.18]Don't trust anybody.
[347:35.38]Oh no.
[347:39.32]Yeah, probably eventually.
[347:52.07]I imagine I'll do a kind of a world tour at some point, maybe into my 40s or 50s or something.
[348:10.35]World tour announcement.
[348:11.73]No.
[348:15.96]And that's why I'm going to be going to every major city in the world.
[348:20.96]A hundred cities in a hundred days.
[348:43.70]You know what I really want to do?
[348:46.62]I just want to go into a bar in Scotland.
[348:50.00]Just like sit down.
[348:52.25]Just get whatever they have on tap.
[348:55.65]And just have somebody just talk to me.
[349:01.35]You know what I mean?
[349:01.81]I just want to sit there on that stool.
[349:06.39]And just look over to the left and right.
[349:10.18]And just like, what's your story?
[349:12.42]Okay.
[349:15.59]What's your story?
[349:16.31]Let me hear it.
[349:16.71]No bar?
[349:27.56]Yeah, a pub.
[349:28.18]That's what I mean.
[349:28.66]That's very profound, dude.
[349:49.76]I'm serious, though.
[349:50.58]I think that would be nice.
[349:54.74]Dude, yeah, I just said that so everybody would be like, oh my god.
[349:57.98]He's so well-traveled and he's so... He just wants to have a conversation.
[350:13.09]You want people to understand them.
[350:16.57]But I could nod.
[350:17.37]I could nod.
[350:35.44]Don't cast a spell at me.
[350:49.15]Dude, you missed the legendary ancient scroll.
[350:52.25]I don't need that shit.
[350:54.66]You think I need the legendary scroll?
[350:56.32]No.
[350:57.10]Give me two packs of cigarettes.
[350:59.52]And a fucking axe.
[351:03.46]I'll be done in an hour.
[351:18.25]Get your whole fucking crew, huh?
[351:20.39]Get your whole crew out of here.
[351:36.70]Ah!
[351:42.82]Oh, he was one hit.
[351:45.34]I'm alive?
[351:49.22]It's just so dark.
[351:57.30]Bro, you died to a friar.
[351:58.88]Hey, his buddy jumped on my back and went... It wasn't... Hey, that was 2v1.
[352:30.15]Almost.
[352:34.60]But yeah, I think there's a lot of cool places to see.
[352:37.98]The thing about the United States, if those of you that may not have ever been here, the United States is very, very different across the whole country.
[352:50.92]It's almost like four or five different countries.
[352:56.42]There's so many wildly different climates, wildly different people.
[353:01.83]It really does sometimes feel like a few different countries.
[353:10.13]Yeah, we got multiple Star Wars worlds.
[353:12.92]Stole that from chat.
[353:36.50]I don't really understand how to play Barbarian.
[353:38.02]Because, like, I swing and then I just, like, oh, fuck.
[353:42.83]Is there, am I missing something here?
[353:44.19]I feel like I'm getting hit way too much.
[354:20.23]I'd rather eat 50 hot dogs or travel the world.
[354:27.47]Why can't I do both of those things?
[354:31.70]You're thinking too limited here.
[354:41.46]I have to choose one.
[354:43.16]I would travel the world.
[354:47.76]You can get a hot dog whenever you want to get a hot dog.
[354:50.46]Traveling the world is something that's kind of a big deal.
[354:53.34]I could eat a hot dog every day for the next two months.
[355:00.30]I mean, I wouldn't want to do that, but I could.
[355:07.86]But it's 50.
[355:10.14]Yeah, the 50 hot dog sounds like a punishment, not a reward.
[355:19.13]Hold on.
[355:26.09]Ow!
[355:30.88]Alright, I'm gonna... That hurt.
[355:35.00]Alright, so I... Oh, shit.
[355:38.00]Am I bleeding?
[355:40.73]Uh-oh.
[355:44.19]That would be unfortunate.
[355:45.83]I think I might be.
[355:50.26]Mmm, hold on.
[355:58.00]Yeah, give me a sec.
[355:59.62]Am I?
[355:59.94]Okay, so, the issue that just happened... Damn.
[356:11.81]Okay, so, let me explain.
[356:13.84]No, yeah, I am.
[356:14.64]Shit.
[356:16.46]Shit.
[356:18.45]Uh, give me one second.
[356:20.37]I'm fine, don't worry.
[356:21.65]So, this is actually kind of funny.
[356:26.06]I have a bloody nose right now.
[356:28.48]And it's because there was a really hard-ass booger in my nose, and I just went to, like, kind of rub my nose, and this really hard booger just hurt me.
[356:39.18]It's kind of funny, in a way, but, like, fuck, it sucks.
[356:41.86]I'll be right back.
[356:45.56]That's, uh, unfortunate.
[356:46.52]Be right back.
[356:50.63]He ripped his own brain out.
[356:52.33]Very effective.
[357:50.25]so so
[358:44.10]you
[361:51.17]I'm back.
[361:51.83]I didn't realize it wasn't at a VRB screen.
[361:57.07]Oops.
[361:58.85]I'm good.
[361:59.39]I have tissue paper stuffed up my nose.
[362:03.19]Hey, booger boy.
[362:04.21]Yeah.
[362:13.18]Can we see?
[362:13.70]No, I...
[362:18.32]I got some liquidation here.
[362:21.20]It'll be hard to drink this if it's in my nose, though.
[362:34.55]That's hard to do.
[362:38.27]Did you at least eat the booger?
[362:40.51]Bro, what do you think?
[362:43.59]No, shut up.
[362:46.41]Time that person out for, I don't know, a few days.
[362:48.63]I don't know.
[362:50.09]Shut up.
[362:50.59]No, I didn't.
[362:51.49]That's disgusting.
[362:52.35]Damn that person for a week.
[363:01.16]Okay.
[363:02.36]Let me try...
[363:07.09]I want to try... Let me go back to the thing I was doing before.
[363:11.02]Are you even going to play SCORN?
[363:27.87]Okay.
[363:33.91]Okay.
[363:37.25]Let's go prepared.
[363:38.03]Let me just take all this stuff.
[363:39.15]I got plenty of money.
[363:51.92]I'll try this one more time.
[363:55.34]This shit is so hard though.
[363:56.52]Yeah, I don't really know what happened.
[364:08.92]It does get very dry out here.
[364:10.02]It's very cold and it's very dry in Vegas right now.
[364:13.28]I'm not really prone to nosebleeds.
[364:15.76]But I think there was just... There was a... Went a little too hard in there.
[364:21.57]And I rubbed.
[364:23.97]I do this thing a lot.
[364:25.41]I don't know if it's just something... I don't know.
[364:27.17]Call it like a...
[364:29.76]kind of compulsive thing that I do.
[364:32.68]But a lot of times I will pinch my nose and like kind of pull down a little.
[364:37.97]Just like kind of rub, like pinch, pull.
[364:39.65]I do it all the time.
[364:40.99]You probably see me do it on camera a lot.
[364:43.57]Where I kind of like take my index finger and my thumb and I go like just rub, pull.
[364:50.53]I do it all the time.
[364:52.31]So I did that and caused a nosebleed somehow.
[365:03.14]That does sound like a really, really suspicious way to tell everybody that as a nearly 40-year-old man, I was picking my nose when you couldn't see it.
[365:17.52]Well, you see, I do this thing where...
[365:35.86]Alright, let's go.
[365:36.44]I'm fighting the boss.
[365:40.59]One, two.
[365:40.97]Shit.
[365:46.87]Three hit combo.
[366:07.26]Come on, I got that.
[366:35.64]Go against the wall.
[366:47.23]Don't even.
[366:48.33]I'm fighting this.
[366:48.97]Don't hurt me.
[367:18.21]Not again.
[367:19.05]Fucking die.
[367:41.48]Oh my God.
[367:42.78]Damn it.
[367:50.58]I kept, I kept back up, back up, back up, bing!
[367:53.50]Into wall.
[367:55.09]Now you're in trouble.
[368:04.80]I have no idea if I was even close.
[368:06.84]But, whatever.
[368:19.96]Oh yeah, I forgot I got attacked.
[368:20.98]75%.
[368:24.08]Just started aggroing stuff in the room and at that point it's just over.
[368:45.01]It's late.
[368:46.29]It is late.
[368:48.13]But I'm a late night Andy now.
[369:00.94]I'm just going to leave.
[369:02.48]Let's just go back in here.
[369:03.44]Alright.
[369:22.44]He's dreaming of that Scotland pub.
[369:29.76]True.
[369:38.13]You think it's the earwigs in your brain that are making you slowly nocturnal?
[369:43.57]Are earwigs nocturnal?
[369:54.89]Ooh.
[369:58.24]Okay.
[370:00.42]That's pretty good.
[370:01.38]It's like a Diamondback here or something.
[370:09.89]Can't get back here, can I?
[370:16.68]Just hide here the whole match.
[370:18.36]Unfortunately, I am not near the center.
[370:36.93]I want to take you one at a time, please.
[370:40.27]Don't you dare come together.
[370:44.23]You seriously hit me in the fucking head.
[370:46.95]Oh my god.
[370:47.57]Oh my god.
[370:49.19]I can't.
[370:51.15]I died in two arrows.
[370:53.83]Did he headshot me twice in a fucking row?
[370:58.58]I died from... Guys, I shot 15 arrows at somebody and hit them in the head 15 times and they didn't die.
[371:06.18]I got hit with two arrows and I'm dead.
[371:18.23]Aim really high with the shield.
[371:19.70]It's awkward.
[371:22.44]Jesus.
[371:39.96]Crouch and aim stupid high.
[371:53.17]I like this comment.
[371:54.67]You Muppet, you keep costing me a thousand points.
[372:01.22]What's the statistics here?
[372:03.34]How many bets have there been?
[372:04.44]And how many have actually, how many have I won?
[372:07.38]How many have I, you know, oh, I made it out.
[372:10.04]Four?
[372:10.40]Three?
[372:10.68]Out of like 30?
[372:13.92]Those odds are very bad.
[372:18.52]You can't put it on double zero every time at the roulette table, and when the dealer is like, oh, sorry, it's red 20.
[372:25.27]You'd be like, ah, you fucking muppet.
[372:28.03]Why is it not on the green one?
[372:29.41]The one out of 35.
[372:30.41]Oh, shit, I just blew my snot thing out.
[372:36.33]Hold on.
[372:40.25]I gotta put this back in.
[372:48.20]You're betting against the edge.
[372:50.68]There's an edge here, and you're betting against it.
[372:58.83]Stop trolling it.
[373:00.03]I'm... I... Why... I... I'm not... I'm... This game's... Yeah, fuck!
[373:07.23]You fucking muppet!
[373:17.67]Oh, God damn it.
[373:23.65]I'm telling you, stop betting green.
[373:25.30]Stop betting zero and double zero.
[373:27.38]It's not going to come up.
[373:28.42]You need to be betting a strategy bet, right?
[373:31.94]I'm going to... God damn it.
[373:45.23]This one's so hard.
[373:48.84]Okay.
[373:50.60]Uh, I'm gonna do this one.
[374:01.37]You didn't even put an English accent on?
[374:05.34]While doing the Muppet thing?
[374:06.46]I didn't... I don't know if that person's English.
[374:15.02]So many people have lost money.
[374:18.21]Okay, right now it is 270k to 4 million.
[374:25.62]It's not good.
[374:26.98]It's not good.
[374:28.10]The believers have been drained completely.
[374:32.94]200k to 4 million?
[374:37.30]It's... We're kind of bleeding out all the believers.
[374:40.60]I actually kind of feel bad.
[374:42.86]I need some of these believers to get a big win here.
[374:46.80]Otherwise, it's only going to be doubters with the capital.
[374:51.78]I can't have that.
[374:53.94]I'm trying as hard as I can now.
[374:55.00]I can't have that.
[374:57.78]It'll just be all doubters.
[375:05.86]Let's go.
[375:06.21]Here it is.
[375:33.39]Somebody's close.
[375:57.01]Ow!
[376:03.55]Oh, somebody on the left.
[376:15.62]There's too many archers in here.
[376:33.93]Fuck you!
[376:51.33]Give me all your stuff.
[376:52.01]Give me everything you want.
[376:53.75]Stop rolling.
[376:54.33]Stop rolling.
[376:54.81]Stop rolling.
[376:55.17]What do you have?
[377:06.72]I took... Okay, I got everything.
[377:10.79]Actually, I don't need this shit.
[377:11.63]17.
[377:12.75]Nope.
[377:13.13]I have a lockpick.
[377:20.69]Which can get... You fuck this up.
[377:22.90]I'm gonna be very pissed off at you.
[377:40.03]I need health though.
[377:47.62]I can't use the... What the fuck was that?
[378:00.23]What just... Why did a clock just appear?
[378:03.07]Whatever.
[378:03.41]Okay, I don't...
[378:17.35]I looked away for one second, I was like, oh, that'll be fine.
[378:20.23]Cool, lockpick.
[378:20.95]Alright, potions.
[378:28.66]This, I actually, I have to get out from this one, I do.
[378:36.16]Look at all these trinkets and shit.
[378:38.45]I gotta get out of here.
[378:46.65]Healing potions or something, come on.
[378:48.73]Are they alive?
[378:58.87]Thank you.
[379:03.31]What the fuck?
[379:04.81]Oh, it's a mage.
[379:43.90]Time to go.
[379:44.26]In a minute.
[379:47.53]In a minute.
[379:48.01]In one minute.
[380:23.68]Is it one or is it two?
[380:27.10]It's two.
[380:49.98]Okay.
[380:51.28]Loot, loot, loot.
[380:53.60]Nice.
[380:54.41]Worth it.
[381:06.59]Yep.
[381:07.72]Good.
[381:08.82]Oh, I'll take it.
[381:12.76]Something.
[381:13.20]Wait.
[381:21.79]Hey dude, make sure you fight as many monsters as you can.
[381:26.95]I see what you're doing.
[381:39.62]Look at this little fucking place.
[381:46.79]That doesn't really help me.
[382:10.70]Nice.
[382:10.92]Okay.
[382:20.26]Don't want to fight that.
[382:21.02]I'm just going to go this way.
[382:22.02]Okay.
[382:33.58]Alright.
[382:34.02]Portal.
[382:35.50]Portal is somewhere.
[382:36.58]We've got some dead bodies.
[382:38.66]Portal.
[382:41.76]I just heard one.
[382:43.52]Where is it?
[382:46.09]I just heard one.
[383:10.99]Oh my god, it's a portal!
[383:12.29]Get me out of here!
[383:23.24]Yes!
[383:24.46]Believers, believe it!
[383:28.38]I'm gonna call that an unbelievably clutch Molotov to buy me the time to open the portal to get the heck out of here.
[383:44.28]Yes!
[383:46.04]Look at all this shit.
[383:48.84]Look at all this.
[383:50.25]And... I left... I got it.
[383:52.79]Didn't I get out with something pretty nice?
[383:58.33]Eh.
[384:02.79]I swear I got a... Oh, the blue is the last round when I... Yeah, that was unfortunate.
[384:11.32]Huge payout.
[384:16.40]I'm actually so sad.
[384:17.58]Oh, well, the odds weren't that good.
[384:19.06]I would have... Oh, no.
[384:21.46]I feel bad.
[384:22.21]You didn't win.
[384:23.99]Oh.
[384:25.51]Oh, no.
[384:27.63]Everyone's sad.
[384:39.02]Well, that worked.
[384:41.56]Okay.
[384:42.12]Let's get some money.
[384:57.22]Hmm.
[384:57.74]Is it going to be a lot?
[385:04.08]Nice.
[385:07.64]Nice.
[385:08.44]Nice.
[385:09.06]Nice.
[385:09.98]Nice.
[385:13.46]Ooh.
[385:15.36]Ooh.
[385:16.66]Ooh.
[385:17.96]Oh yeah.
[385:19.04]This is big money now.
[385:20.76]Look at this.
[385:21.08]65 gold.
[385:33.37]Who wants to buy this thing?
[385:40.90]I'm going to actually hold on to this.
[385:41.82]I feel like a crystal ball is pretty good to have.
[385:56.62]For a wizard.
[385:59.17]Hey, well.
[386:01.69]What if I play with a wizard?
[386:06.94]Who knows?
[386:10.19]Hey, I'm saving this for Holly.
[386:11.93]I think she's gonna play a wizard.
[386:22.27]Okay.
[386:26.19]Um... Only four gold.
[386:30.94]And I feel like... Eh, yeah, whatever.
[386:39.09]That was worth a lot.
[386:57.08]I've got a pretty decent amount of money now.
[387:00.54]Do I dare gamble it?
[387:20.64]Of course.
[387:21.78]Not.
[387:35.31]Um...
[387:57.01]No, I'm saving it.
[388:10.60]Why do I have multiple torches?
[388:17.44]I will buy a weapon though.
[388:27.21]22.
[388:27.27]None of these are any good.
[388:36.73]I got bandages.
[388:43.14]I'll buy potions though.
[388:56.58]I would.
[388:58.46]Why this here?
[389:02.34]19 health 54 that sounds just that's just like awful.
[389:10.56]Alright, I'm going to do another one.
[389:22.89]But I have perks.
[389:28.67]Okay, I think I've stopped bleeding.
[389:30.95]So that's good.
[389:33.65]Do a high roller?
[389:34.43]I am not ready.
[389:35.23]You want me to go into high roller looking like this?
[389:39.78]I'm wearing an elf costume with a fish tank on my head.
[389:43.08]You want me to go into the high roller zone and get fucking one shot by somebody's legendary weapon?
[389:54.29]You just want to see me lose 100 gold.
[389:59.92]yeah guys I have a serving tray for a shield
[390:25.67]It's gonna get attacked with the legendary ice sword of the mountain.
[390:30.41]And it's gonna crumble and it's gonna split me in half.
[390:36.09]Alright, I'm just gonna go again.
[390:39.33]Actually, like, last one.
[390:41.47]Probably for the night.
[390:42.85]Because, I mean, I do, you know, I am very, very into it.
[390:51.79]Mm-mm-mm.
[391:04.55]He's never gonna say hi to Smush.
[391:10.38]You know what the worst part about this is?
[391:12.78]I really like this game.
[391:13.64]And they're about to take it away from me.
[391:16.95]In like five days.
[391:18.29]They're gonna take it away from me.
[391:30.84]I wonder when the actual just kind of beta, just like it's open and it's going to be there for a while.
[391:37.82]I wonder when the beta actually will be, because it's supposed to be coming out at the end of the year.
[391:41.20]Is that full on 1.0, right?
[391:43.02]This is just a play test, yeah.
[391:52.86]I think it's, in my personal opinion, playing this.
[391:57.82]I feel like it's almost at that point where I think they could probably slap a beta on it.
[392:27.28]But that's, you know, ooh, okay, I have to win this.
[392:31.20]But that's also just me being selfish.
[392:34.89]And, um, you know, like, I want to play it.
[392:41.65]So that's, you know, me being selfish.
[392:43.97]What is that, spider?
[393:02.93]Don't play Tarkov.
[393:05.11]Tarkov is like this, right?
[393:06.94]Same kind of idea, but with machine guns.
[393:09.80]I actually prefer this than that.
[393:16.89]I prefer the sort of dungeon kind of medieval fantasy.
[393:19.31]Somebody's here.
[393:22.75]I don't know what the hell he's doing.
[393:27.56]Oh, come on.
[393:38.05]Fuck, this is bad.
[393:39.31]There's no getting out of this.
[393:40.09]Fucking kill your fucking priest, I'll be happy!
[393:49.20]Got him.
[394:11.96]You have the best take sometimes, but then you ruin it by talking about drinking your own piss or something.
[394:20.35]All things must be balanced.
[394:39.50]What if I talked about drinking my own piss?
[394:43.62]That's... I've never said that.
[394:54.50]Oh, I... whatever.
[394:55.66]That's where I said I was... People gave me shit because I had a water filter and I was like, oh, it's great.
[395:00.57]And they were like, oh, actually, that water filter sucks.
[395:02.45]And I was like, I'll piss in it and drink it.
[395:03.75]And I never did it.
[395:12.97]Yeah, I remember.
[395:13.55]I was like, oh man, that water filter, dude, it's like a scam.
[395:17.13]And I'm like, what are you... Like, I could piss in this thing and drink it.
[395:19.60]And everyone's like, dude, do it then.
[395:20.46]And I was like, I will.
[395:22.00]And then I just got called out and didn't do it.
[395:47.05]I hate that you just hit me.
[395:48.17]That's so unfair.
[396:17.10]Somebody's shooting me with a bow and fucking arrow.
[396:21.72]And I don't know if it's a person or if it's a monster.
[396:24.80]Oh no.
[396:30.54]That's just not going to happen.
[396:37.54]This guy's buddy just died.
[396:40.22]And I'm just going to absolutely scare the shit out of him here.
[396:49.22]Oh my god, your friend had nothing.
[396:50.73]Your friend had nothing.
[396:56.11]What the fuck?
[396:59.05]Well, good luck, because now we're both fucking dead.
[397:10.02]What?
[397:10.62]Was he invisible?
[397:11.36]He's invisible, wasn't he?
[397:19.75]invisible how long can they stay invisible are they actually invisible invisible or is it kind of rogues can go invisible how long does it last it's until that way is it it's like shadow meld from warcraft every day I you know every day I just see how good this class really is uh there we go
[397:54.01]About 20 seconds if they're stationary.
[398:12.41]I remember when a rogue used to kill me in WoW.
[398:22.07]I would have a fucking mental breakdown.
[398:24.17]I remember just questing in like Stranglethorn Vale and you would hear that KOO!
[398:34.30]Kidney shot or whatever it was and you just couldn't move and then it was like KOO!
[398:37.12]KOO!
[398:37.92]KOO!
[398:38.42]And you stunned again and then that person would just sit there for like an hour and I would just get my body and they would just do it again.
[398:51.01]She's like, log off, bro.
[398:53.31]Log off.
[399:00.74]I was that guy, were you?
[399:03.92]You're a real piece of work, I'll tell you.
[399:26.48]I just hit the ceiling.
[399:32.09]Good.
[399:37.57]That's very good.
[399:46.80]Believers, are you there?
[400:13.33]Improving my usefulness.
[400:38.49]Good start.
[400:41.70]Is he just running around in a circle?
[400:58.92]Dermot, turn the brightness down.
[401:00.10]No, I can't play it.
[401:02.54]I can't play it unless the brightness is up like 20-30% at least.
[401:04.69]My eyes are so bad.
[401:09.65]You know what's crazy?
[401:11.44]My eyes, when I'm looking at a monitor, are worse than just real life.
[401:17.31]I don't know why that is.
[401:41.00]Boomer eyes?
[401:41.51]Oh my god, stop it.
[401:57.12]Oh shit.
[401:58.12]What happened to this person?
[402:00.72]Oh, sorry, man.
[402:04.39]I'll take this.
[402:12.08]I tried to help him, I did.
[402:13.96]But this game, this game is, uh... This game is pretty hard.
[402:18.92]Will you leave me alone for one second?
[402:27.59]Oh my god, you fucking little shits.
[402:30.97]I'm gonna wrap around.
[402:56.20]I'm over here, man.
[402:56.86]Okay.
[403:17.10]Okay.
[403:17.32]It's a little slow.
[403:28.19]Dude, where's my... Oh my god, I thought this was going to be so much easier.
[403:33.97]I thought this was going to be so much easier.
[403:38.72]Holy shit, that was a disaster.
[403:47.53]No, don't even.
[403:48.27]Please, don't.
[403:49.17]Please, please, please, please.
[403:50.65]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[403:53.33]Not right now.
[403:55.80]Getting kind of just destroyed at every turn.
[403:57.60]This is so bad.
[403:58.50]This is bad.
[404:03.18]I'm in trouble.
[404:06.46]Holy shit.
[404:07.14]You saved my life.
[404:08.02]Thank you.
[404:16.15]Thank you.
[404:16.61]For the love of God, close this door.
[404:17.73]For the love of God, close this door.
[404:18.55]Okay.
[404:19.31]Woo!
[404:19.75]Okay.
[404:23.47]Portal.
[404:24.19]Portal.
[404:27.35]Oh, dear.
[404:28.97]Careful, careful.
[404:29.63]There's a monster behind you.
[404:37.86]I gotta be honest, I- Oh, shit.
[404:42.52]No fall damage, right?
[404:43.84]Okay.
[404:45.06]Where- I need a portal.
[405:00.94]What happened?
[405:06.24]The goblin mage killed me?
[405:08.38]From that far away?
[405:11.31]I got sniped from that far away?
[405:14.33]He jumped down.
[405:20.62]Well, I hope you get these items.
[405:36.72]That's sad.
[405:37.98]Alright.
[405:39.86]This is the last one.
[405:41.15]This one counts.
[405:44.27]This is the one that really counts.
[405:48.33]This one counts.
[405:50.56]None of the other ones did.
[405:52.44]I've been playing for about seven hours.
[405:53.62]These were all tutorials leading up to this exact one right now.
[406:11.66]All led up to here.
[406:12.43]Hmm.
[406:25.44]What do you got?
[406:27.00]You two are together?
[406:27.70]Hmm.
[406:30.30]What about you?
[406:30.74]Hmm.
[406:33.38]Not bad.
[406:34.57]Not bad.
[406:36.37]Hmm.
[406:43.38]Not bad.
[406:49.30]That means you need to refund all previous bets.
[406:53.23]Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that's not going to happen.
[406:59.81]I'm getting out and I'm going to leave here with like 300 gold.
[407:06.88]Let's do it.
[407:41.77]You should turn the monitor off for this one.
[407:46.89]That'd be actually really funny.
[407:59.56]Is the gas following me?
[408:18.40]Okay, I got some replacements.
[408:20.78]This is just junk, but I'll take it.
[408:22.84]Alright, let's keep going.
[408:26.36]I'm gonna actually go around.
[408:27.54]I got time.
[408:43.45]Is this poison...
[408:54.74]Somebody else is down here.
[409:16.28]It isn't poison, thank goodness.
[409:39.89]Somebody's down here.
[410:02.46]You better not be full of shit.
[410:19.92]Nice.
[410:31.67]The code.
[410:32.13]Yeah, alright.
[410:33.29]The adventurer code.
[410:34.19]Alright, let's get out of here.
[410:58.52]Oh, he's meditating.
[410:59.52]Ooh.
[411:16.77]You, uh, you coming or?
[411:18.03]Alright.
[411:20.97]Do you need help?
[411:22.89]Why am I talking like he can hear me?
[411:50.31]Yeah, I got full health.
[411:51.05]I don't know if you can hear me.
[411:57.57]No, you can't.
[411:58.09]I got you.
[412:02.87]Don't worry.
[412:03.17]I'll protect you.
[412:11.37]Alright.
[412:12.63]Okay, then go over here.
[412:13.21]Be careful.
[412:13.57]This is really dangerous.
[412:14.79]A wizard like you.
[412:40.34]He's hallucinating again.
[412:41.34]This isn't even a multiplayer game.
[412:54.19]I don't understand what Jeremy's talking about.
[412:56.77]He's been playing Scrabble on stream for the last six hours.
[413:00.73]Against the computer.
[413:01.49]Why is he talking about swords and stuff?
[413:16.21]Kinda just like taking everything.
[413:19.03]That stuff sucks.
[413:30.37]Friendly?
[413:30.75]There's a boss down there.
[413:37.30]Can we kill it together?
[413:38.68]Well, we're gonna have to figure that out!
[413:41.52]We're gonna have to go!
[413:42.32]We're gonna have to do it, I think!
[413:45.93]It's mine!
[413:46.27]Holy shit!
[413:50.18]Oh my god!
[413:50.94]Oh my god!
[413:52.44]That's a fucking purple!
[413:53.92]That's a purple, bro!
[413:55.33]I'm leaving!
[413:56.11]I'm out of here!
[413:57.15]I'm fucking out of here!
[413:58.07]It's mine!
[413:59.05]It's all mine!
[414:05.18]Oh shit, we separated.
[414:06.70]Is this cool?
[414:08.06]Wait, could he use that?
[414:08.98]Maybe I could give it to him.
[414:10.40]Hold on.
[414:11.06]Hold on a minute here.
[414:11.92]Hold on a second here.
[414:12.84]Hold on a minute here.
[414:13.56]Hey, hold on a minute here.
[414:14.38]Hey, wait a minute.
[414:15.24]Wait a minute.
[414:15.58]Hold on.
[414:15.86]Everybody relax.
[414:16.82]Everybody relax for a second.
[414:17.66]I'm freaking out.
[414:24.79]I can't jump that.
[414:32.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[414:33.25]What is, who is it for?
[414:35.32]Warden Ranger.
[414:36.44]Do we have a ranger anywhere over here?
[414:39.62]I actually would give it to the ranger if there's a ranger here.
[414:54.37]Give him the crystal ball.
[414:56.45]Oh, hey.
[415:01.23]Can you use that?
[415:08.27]Should I do the Diablo II thing where you like dropped it on the ground and picked it up really quickly just to like piss everybody off?
[415:13.28]I would be pleased to do that.
[415:17.90]And anytime it got grabbed, they would just leave the game.
[415:20.55]They would just exit.
[415:22.95]I'm not gonna- I'm kidding.
[415:24.19]I would never do that.
[415:29.95]But like if there really was a ranger with us, I would absolutely give it to them.
[415:33.88]Because like that's fucking cool.
[415:37.03]It's just too bad it's not for a wizard.
[415:40.61]We probably should go over here.
[415:46.19]I used to do that in fucking Tibia.
[415:56.83]See you later!
[415:58.25]See you later!
[415:59.83]See you later!
[416:00.83]See you later!
[416:01.75]See you later!
[416:02.29]Have fun everybody!
[416:03.54]Have fun!
[416:03.86]I got a fucking purple.
[416:06.52]I got a purple.
[416:07.30]I got a purple.
[416:17.40]I wish there was a ranger in our, like, part of that little group.
[416:27.49]Because if you drop that for somebody that's actually using that class, and they would just... It would be like, holy shit, dude, really?
[416:33.51]Like, if somebody dropped me something for that I could use...
[416:45.12]Quick, end the stream.
[416:46.34]No.
[416:56.17]I will probably hold on to this.
[416:58.61]Cause I will probably, I'm not gonna, I'll probably give this to somebody.
[417:01.99]Oh, by the way, let me like ask like an actual question here.
[417:04.47]Like, I know I was just kind of fucking around.
[417:05.72]Was that like BM?
[417:06.98]Like, I don't want to be like that guy.
[417:08.60]I know we're just kind of fucking around here, but is that like, is that BM or anything?
[417:13.08]Like, was I like a dick for doing that?
[417:15.56]Like, be honest with me.
[417:16.50]Cause I don't, I don't want to like, you know.
[417:23.87]Yeah.
[417:24.29]I said, yeah.
[417:34.13]The wizard was the one who killed it.
[417:44.60]I just saw it die.
[417:49.56]Like, I just saw fucking red.
[417:52.21]And it was like a purple.
[417:53.17]I just picked it up and I freaked out.
[417:57.51]Leaving him stuck there was meaner.
[418:14.40]true is there any way to do recent players ah he feels bad well I just I like don't know the etiquette and even if there is not I mean here's the thing it is like it's just like a demo so it's not like
[418:42.80]But I don't want to be like a dick.
[418:53.65]You would leave in a heartbeat if you were Jerva.
[418:59.95]Is there actually like a recent players list?
[419:01.39]Because I will just send it to them.
[419:02.67]I really don't even care.
[419:03.43]I don't want to be like an asshole.
[419:06.84]It was like funny for a second.
[419:07.84]And I'm like, wait a minute.
[419:08.48]That is actually really good.
[419:10.06]And somebody could probably sell that.
[419:11.08]But it is like five days left on the beta, right?
[419:19.71]You're thinking too much about it.
[419:21.95]Yeah, I probably am.
[419:31.40]It's a beta.
[419:31.84]There are no rules.
[419:33.44]That's true.
[419:34.46]That's true.
[419:39.96]Maybe if it was a legendary.
[419:54.39]Should I?
[419:54.91]Should you use the gathering halls?
[419:56.23]Should be happy about it.
[420:01.23]Yeah.
[420:07.71]Trade.
[420:09.41]What if I went into trade and I was like, hey, the wizard that I just took that purple from, please DM me.
[420:22.56]DM for BM.
[420:28.14]He gave you the gloves you dropped.
[420:29.14]Yeah, but they got that.
[420:30.80]Eh, 20-20 hindsight.
[420:31.68]I should have just dropped that for him.
[420:32.92]I feel bad.
[420:33.36]But it's all good.
[420:42.64]Don't forget to stash it.
[420:43.48]Yeah, I got it right here.
[420:47.18]Dude, you gave him a magical globe.
[420:49.27]That's right, I did.
[420:54.41]Dude, don't worry.
[420:55.01]What if he's a terrible guy in real life?
[420:56.91]That's not the point.
[421:01.97]That's not the point.
[421:09.03]He probably thought the orb is what you got.
[421:10.77]I should have just gave it to him.
[421:13.96]It's all good.
[421:14.48]Alright.
[421:15.50]One more.
[421:39.92]I'm gonna keep this.
[421:52.81]Where did I get this from?
[421:53.95]Oh my god, this is for a wizard.
[421:59.53]Oh my god, how did I not see this?
[422:05.21]Did I get that?
[422:06.11]I gotta get in contact.
[422:07.23]I gotta fucking hit that guy up.
[422:08.73]I took all of his stuff.
[422:10.25]I gotta give him that fucking dagger.
[422:11.91]I have to.
[422:12.65]I have to find that person.
[422:14.29]I feel fucking terrible.
[422:16.33]Alright, I'm gonna play another one. ...
[422:40.55]Stash it for you.
[422:49.35]Screaming, it's all mine.
[422:51.62]And then I feel bad.
[422:53.36]I get my brain just like didn't piece together like what I was doing.
[422:59.30]And I'm just like, oh, yeah.
[423:00.62]Ha ha.
[423:01.08]Wait.
[423:01.50]Oh, right.
[423:02.20]Those are the people here.
[423:04.68]That's fucking.
[423:05.84]Oh, well.
[423:26.93]Stash the shit?
[423:27.95]I did, I did.
[423:28.43]Does anybody... Hold on.
[423:46.84]Where's the... Can I...
[423:57.62]Anybody remember their name?
[424:04.45]Somebody has to remember their name.
[424:14.78]Oh, you have stream remote on.
[424:18.80]Steam recent players.
[424:19.96]I don't have... I'm not really... Maybe I can.
[424:22.61]Let's see.
[424:28.73]Recent game.
[424:29.73]No.
[424:32.39]What are the things up top?
[424:37.13]Wizards.
[424:39.99]There's only 18 wizards in the whole game.
[424:41.86]Oh, well.
[424:55.74]Fame and Karma, it'll show you.
[424:58.82]Oh, I knew it was somewhere.
[425:03.94]Oh, there was no teammates.
[425:05.20]Because we weren't technically in a team together.
[425:12.39]Alright, let me sell this stuff and we'll do one more.
[425:35.83]He's gone forever.
[425:48.31]How many more?
[425:48.75]One more?
[425:49.07]That's a good question.
[426:04.28]Got to be extra generous next time to make up for it.
[426:08.06]Yeah, I will atone for my sins.
[426:10.48]I will.
[426:27.25]It's so funny because...
[426:31.62]Golem with the ring or something.
[426:33.78]I spent the last seven hours playing and like I haven't been playing very well and all of a sudden like, oh my god, an amazing item taken.
[426:42.23]Yes, like it's mine.
[426:56.08]Pretty good.
[427:11.53]Pretty good.
[427:11.87]You can see your recent players.
[427:31.43]I just looked.
[427:32.93]There's nothing there.
[427:41.24]You were like a little raccoon.
[427:42.97]I know!
[427:43.39]That's like what it felt like.
[427:44.81]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[428:16.80]Oh my god, I'm fucking sloppy right now.
[428:38.03]30?
[428:40.65]I really do want to make it out because I have a lot of decent stuff.
[428:49.40]It's okay.
[428:49.96]It wasn't malicious.
[428:53.35]But I still feel bad about it.
[429:04.49]Bugs Bunny.
[429:09.07]Why is Bugs Bunny Peter Griffin the same character?
[429:14.92]Why is that?
[429:34.49]They aren't.
[429:34.91]It's just me.
[429:35.79]Yeah.
[429:36.37]My impression.
[429:37.23]Yeah.
[429:40.17]Oh, fuck.
[429:40.81]That's always scary.
[429:41.89]Every time.
[429:42.39]It really is.
[429:42.85]Alright.
[429:48.05]I'm just gonna move because I'm kind of far away.
[429:51.93]I actually... His revenge.
[429:55.96]This is revenge for, uh... For...
[430:05.60]The wizard's revenge.
[430:06.50]That was not altruistic enough.
[430:37.65]I can see names.
[430:45.38]Unless they're just scrambled nonsense, are they?
[431:08.92]He's addicted?
[431:09.61]Yeah, I am.
[432:00.44]Somebody's behind that door.
[432:22.15]Noooo!
[432:23.77]They were friends.
[433:01.26]Everything was going so well until you were blinded by greed.
[433:10.07]Shit.
[433:10.87]Somebody said, hey dude, does the stolen equipment work better?
[433:13.27]Okay, we laugh about this and it's like really not that big of a deal.
[433:23.18]I shit you not.
[433:24.04]A couple hours from now, I'm going to be lying in bed.
[433:29.63]You're talking to Holly.
[433:31.37]And I was going to be like, I feel real bad about that wizard.
[433:33.96]I wonder if I can like reach out to him and give it back to him.
[433:48.06]Ow.
[433:49.22]What?
[433:50.20]Oh my God.
[433:51.18]Don't even vote.
[433:51.92]It doesn't count.
[433:52.62]Don't even vote.
[433:53.22]It doesn't count.
[433:53.75]Don't even vote.
[433:54.27]It doesn't count.
[433:54.69]That's not, that one doesn't count.
[433:55.67]No, no, no.
[433:56.13]That one doesn't count.
[434:02.24]There's been a few stinkers in a row.
[434:03.55]Now, that one doesn't count.
[434:04.67]I walked out and I was looking at chat.
[434:11.94]Well, you're going to bet anyway, so just pretend it's this one.
[434:53.82]I had to pay it forward over here.
[434:56.66]You shot me, so I hit him.
[435:18.46]Hey, my buddy Eric just got his loot stolen by some jackass.
[435:21.42]Be careful.
[435:24.09]Damn, shit.
[435:25.82]I better be on the lookout.
[435:48.23]I was waiting for you.
[435:48.98]I knew you were gonna do that.
[435:50.68]And you still got me with it.
[435:52.20]Somehow.
[435:55.59]These are some real dog shit spawns the last two times.
[435:58.75]Huh?
[436:18.44]Fucking die That's pretty cool
[437:03.12]Get the stink out of the way!
[437:32.64]Can't have any more in there.
[437:34.66]I can't believe this.
[437:41.88]I can't believe he's still alive.
[437:42.72]I feel like I hit you a hundred times.
[437:57.09]Jesus.
[438:07.52]Oh my God.
[438:08.32]I just want to leave, but I can't walk up there.
[438:18.69]What is happening?
[438:27.05]What's happening?
[438:42.10]I need health.
[439:01.90]I need that.
[439:02.94]I need this.
[439:04.30]And you're in the way.
[439:05.69]I got a plan.
[439:30.66]Come and get me.
[439:56.42]Not worth it.
[440:16.81]Ow, you gotta be kidding me.
[440:18.05]You weren't even aiming at me.
[440:19.09]This guy is better than a player.
[440:27.05]What's his deal?
[440:27.71]Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[440:40.82]I'm dead.
[440:41.48]There's three people just fucking chasing my ass.
[440:43.84]Like...
[441:25.70]You're doing great, sweetie.
[441:27.36]Okay.
[441:53.98]So here's the plan.
[441:54.80]I'm gonna do this one.
[441:55.88]I'm gonna do this one.
[442:00.96]And then one more solo goblin world.
[442:04.02]Just for old time's sake.
[442:08.45]And that's it.
[442:10.03]And then I actually have to go eat.
[442:11.75]I haven't eaten in seven and a half hours.
[442:14.45]So I need to eat.
[442:16.15]I'm getting like brain fog.
[442:49.81]I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, you know what I mean?
[442:51.49]I'm just gonna try to get away.
[442:52.89]I'm just gonna try to get out.
[443:08.52]If they're red, does that mean that they're stronger or have more health or something?
[443:11.40]Yes.
[443:14.82]Okay.
[443:20.25]That would explain the damage.
[443:59.83]Why am I not swinging too?
[444:01.41]Wait, what?
[444:03.01]What the fuck happened?
[444:04.01]Why?
[444:05.51]Oh, you have to hit right click, then left click.
[444:08.05]It's backwards.
[444:12.08]That's what the... Okay.
[444:13.60]Fuck, I forgot.
[444:16.00]Just to do the swing to go one, two with the swords, you have to do right click, then left click.
[444:20.56]Not left click and right click.
[444:22.10]You have to hit right click first.
[444:26.09]Oh, that was annoying.
[444:41.33]That laugh.
[444:43.79]Yeah.
[444:45.08]So if you have two swords, you can't press left click first.
[444:48.84]You'll just swing the left side.
[444:50.14]You can't do left and right.
[444:51.76]You have to hit right click first.
[444:54.29]Which is... Come on, Gwen.
[445:52.90]Okay, not bad.
[445:53.94]I have to get out of here though.
[446:11.37]Yeah, this is truly the last one.
[446:40.54]Just trying to get out of here without getting hit once.
[446:42.90]Fuck.
[446:43.12]Alright, actually have to get out of here now.
[447:36.43]Surprising that that did not kill.
[447:47.67]Oh, Jesus.
[447:48.47]I got so complacent.
[447:53.12]I just was like, oh, I'm just like walking around just attacking random shit.
[448:01.60]Jesus.
[448:02.00]No.
[448:02.40]No.
[448:06.11]No, no, no, no.
[448:09.13]Oh my goodness.
[448:10.37]What a disaster.
[448:13.17]Oh, come on.
[448:13.95]There's no getting out of that.
[448:17.94]That one sucked.
[448:18.96]That one didn't count.
[448:20.52]That truly was just stupid.
[448:22.42]That just didn't count.
[448:23.72]I escaped that shit.
[448:24.68]Turn around, guy with the bow and arrow.
[448:25.84]I'm just dead.
[448:29.52]That one didn't count.
[448:34.35]Otto.
[449:11.80]Shit spawn.
[449:15.48]I guess I have to... What is this?
[449:17.03]A red bug?
[449:20.49]What?
[449:25.90]I can't move.
[449:56.35]No matter what happens, this is it.
[450:03.11]I could die in the first 10 seconds and that's it.
[450:06.88]I'll come back to it.
[450:20.49]Yeah, this is the final match.
[450:22.49]No matter what happens.
[450:28.69]Next time I will be in a party.
[450:32.25]Or maybe I'll play solo.
[450:32.95]I don't know.
[450:34.39]I'll be playing this again 100% this week.
[450:36.88]You bet your ass.
[450:55.83]Play it with Ster.
[450:56.49]Play it with Vinny.
[451:00.13]Yeah, I mean, whoever wants to play, it's probably a whole crew that can get cycled in and out.
[451:12.50]Okay, final one.
[451:13.62]This is it.
[451:15.16]Actually, I'm going to just quiet down.
[451:16.46]I'm going to focus.
[451:16.96]I'm going to try to win.
[451:21.07]Way too many.
[451:52.91]Nice.
[451:53.51]Very good.
[451:54.31]Very good.
[451:54.97]Very good.
[451:56.81]Hello!
[451:57.11]Let's work together.
[452:05.55]You have a pickaxe?
[452:25.09]Oh shit, you get a bow.
[452:31.55]Dead?
[452:33.60]Oh fuck!
[452:43.70]Every friend I get dies or I steal from them.
[453:10.15]That was my fault?
[453:11.15]What did I do?
[453:12.45]I think he just got shot in the head by an arrow.
[453:14.03]That's very sad.
[453:18.30]It's unfortunate.
[453:19.08]I shouldn't be laughing at that, but I mean... I feel like I've discovered people's bodies a handful of times here.
[453:25.88]Come on, man.
[453:36.47]I have to get out of here.
[453:40.66]I'm not this open ass room.
[453:42.25]No way.
[453:42.59]See you.
[454:10.97]Nope.
[454:48.02]That's pretty good.
[454:48.78]Fuck off.
[455:04.39]Eddie?
[455:04.61]Why is everybody saying Eddie?
[455:19.23]Careful.
[455:22.66]Let's get him.
[455:23.70]Let's get him.
[455:24.18]I need to atone for my sins.
[455:26.59]Let's get him.
[455:40.75]Who's, are we fighting together here or is, I'm, people are just kind of walking around.
[455:48.15]What?
[455:50.98]Dude, alright, somebody pull Akro, please.
[455:52.80]I don't have any healing left.
[456:14.50]Why are people just walking around backstage?
[456:19.70]Are we not fighting this anymore?
[456:20.62]Fuck!
[456:27.81]No!
[456:29.35]I wanted it so bad!
[456:30.81]I wanted to do it so bad!
[456:33.35]Fuck!
[456:35.41]No!
[456:39.73]The shield!
[456:40.53]I thought I blocked it.
[456:43.60]No.
[456:44.54]Oh, that's so annoying.
[456:46.02]I thought I fucking had it.
[456:49.95]I was certain.
[456:51.35]Like a purple was going to drop and it was going to be a whole thing.
[456:53.79]I was going to turn the voice on.
[456:54.85]I was going to be like, hey, take that.
[456:58.07]You've earned it.
[456:59.18]Oh, I had a whole thing planned.
[457:15.29]Why am I in a loading screen?
[457:16.23]What's going on?
[457:22.77]A loading screen?
[457:28.34]What's happening?
[457:29.84]My character's moving.
[457:30.50]Am I spectating?
[457:33.38]What the heck?
[458:12.07]Are you gonna swing, man?
[458:12.91]What are you doing?
[458:25.93]Okay.
[458:30.57]I'm telling your mother.
[458:32.39]Don't.
[458:41.84]I'm not messing around in this room.
[458:49.80]Too many spiders, too many goblins.
[458:54.54]Actually, I think I'm going to have to do this though.
[459:20.53]OK, I'm in the center.
[459:21.61]I can chill out now.
[459:24.76]Just relax, pick up some stuff and leave.
[459:51.89]Do not aggro more.
[459:52.97]That would be a huge mistake.
[460:06.70]Red one.
[460:35.04]Oh, don't lose this.
[460:39.69]What the fuck?
[460:40.75]Oh, it was me.
[460:53.90]Fuck all that shit.
[461:33.92]Good.
[461:34.14]What was that?
[461:38.90]Alright, I gotta go.

[462:24.39]Whatever.
[462:30.70]You muppet that big chest.
[462:32.64]I am not going to do that.
[462:33.82]I needed a lockpick.
[462:43.03]It's the moment of truth right here.
[463:07.18]How the fuck are you still alive?
[463:09.06]I have this 45 gosh darn damage.
[463:13.43]You've got to be shitting me.
[464:04.01]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[464:05.31]I gotta go up, right?
[464:07.37]Up where?

[464:11.31]Fuck that!
[464:15.83]Like... Like up here?
[464:23.66]Does this count?
[464:29.13]Oh my god, there's one over there!
[464:30.59]Come on, make the jump, make the jump, make the jump!
[464:32.49]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

[464:34.57]Relax, relax, relax, relax.
[464:35.65]Get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out.
[464:37.71]Go out on a high note.
[464:38.95]Go out on a high note.
[464:40.15]Go out on a high note.
[464:44.60]Thank god.
[464:48.46]Jesus.
[465:05.25]Only you left.
[465:07.25]One person.
[465:14.49]So what's the strategy here?
[465:15.75]What was he waiting for?
[465:19.51]Was he just afraid of the archer?
[465:25.96]Probably, yeah.
[465:33.14]Nice.
[465:42.40]This is my sin corner.
[465:54.22]It's the guilt armor.
[466:26.38]OK.
[466:31.13]Alright.
[466:34.55]That was very, very, very fun.
[467:06.97]Thank you.
[467:41.53]Oh, it's offhand.
[468:17.21]This is the comedy run.
[468:24.48]This one is not even real.
[468:25.60]There's no betting or anything.
[468:26.76]There's nothing about it.
[468:27.46]It's just a comedy run.
[468:45.38]See?
[468:45.74]It's already funny.
[468:50.08]It's already really funny.
[468:58.88]This is such a bad spawn too.
[469:04.14]No, there's no way.
[469:17.78]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[469:19.82]I'll see you tomorrow.
[469:21.30]Or no, not tomorrow.
[469:22.86]Technically tomorrow.
[469:26.72]Technically tomorrow, so Thursday.
[469:28.25]Because it is technically... No, no, no, no, no.
[469:34.63]Wednesday.
[469:35.05]Because it is technically Tuesday right now.
[469:44.96]So, I'll see you Wednesday.
[469:45.88]We're going to play more of this.
[469:50.52]I want to play more Dark and Darker.
[469:52.10]There's only six days in this test.
[469:57.36]And then they just wipe everything and they put it back in the oven for like another two or three months.
[470:05.04]Yeah, I'll see you guys on I'll see you guys on Wednesday, the 8th.
[470:14.40]Have an awesome rest of your night.
[470:15.90]Take care of yourselves.
[470:17.40]Get some sleep.
[470:25.60]See you later.
[470:28.70]And now that they all left.
[470:50.42]Everyone that wanted to go to bed that really needed to go to bed was like, alright, I'm going to bed.
[470:59.28]See, that person's doing a comedy run.
[471:00.50]I can't do one more.
[471:01.08]This seems good.
[471:20.10]Alright, it's confession time.
[471:26.81]Jesus!
[471:28.75]What a terrible place for that to spawn!
[471:31.43]No!
[471:31.83]Get... Get me out of here!
[471:33.25]Let me out!
[471:34.05]Let me out!
[471:34.59]He's a rabid fucking animal!
[471:36.23]Okay.
[471:59.47]Pretty good comedy run, I would say.
[472:03.61]Peak comedy run.
[472:09.97]What was the confession?
[472:12.15]In the first 30 minutes of playing this game, I thought it was fucking dog shit.
[472:26.69]Like, in the first 30 minutes, I was like, wow, this game is fucking absolute dog shit.
[472:31.39]Like, this is awful.
[472:33.49]Well, I'll play this for like an hour or two, and then I'm fucking never opening this again.
[472:38.10]And then, um... And then I realized what it was.
[472:41.84]And realized that it was fun.
[472:44.72]Now I am telling you, this is probably going to be my favorite game of the year.
[472:53.21]This possibly could be one of my favorite games of the year.
[473:03.61]It's just, it just grabs a hold of you.
[473:15.84]Yeah, I mean, that's obviously a really bold prediction, but I know how I am when I get in the game, and this is really fun.
[473:26.62]Even if it's like kind of a, it's kind of, it's rough, right?
[473:31.11]But rough in kind of a good way.
[473:37.44]Um, I know it's literally February and this game's not even out yet, but I could see myself jumping in this and just playing it and bashing my head against the wall.
[473:53.86]Oh shit, sorry.
[473:55.28]Yeah, I lowered this accidentally.
[474:09.28]Thanks for watching.
[474:09.82]Thanks for staying up.
[474:12.10]We'll play this again.
[474:12.64]I'll see you.
[474:13.70]Probably I'll ping some other streamers and see who wants to play it.
[474:16.11]Maybe on Wednesday.
[474:23.51]Have an amazing rest of your night.
[474:25.43]Get some sleep.
[474:27.93]See you soon.
[474:28.57]Thanks for watching.
[474:37.28]Take care of yourselves.
[474:40.03]See you soon.
[474:41.41]Goodnight, guys.
[474:42.22]Call your mother.
[474:43.50]Call your mother.
[474:45.54]Call your mother.
[474:46.19]There you go.
[474:48.67]Goodnight.
[475:11.11]you
[475:45.95]Thank you.
