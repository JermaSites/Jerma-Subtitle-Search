[03:39.13]Almost just got permabanned, Star.
[03:41.99]Real funny.
[03:47.19]That was real close to a ball sack on stream.
[03:50.81]It's close.
[03:52.47]Was it still funny?
[03:59.64]Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[04:00.94]Alright, why don't I come over so you can see this?
[04:06.99]This music is... Why does the scary music makes that so much worse?
[04:11.55]This is like found footage of me watching Star start making fun of me and then what, does he like stalk me and murder me?
[04:28.97]It started with one video clip.
[04:35.52]Bugle, we need Bugleberry.
[04:36.90]I'm sorry to say, Bugleberry actually contacted me.
[04:41.11]He was just rambling.
[04:43.17]He said that he's not into Halloween anymore.
[04:45.79]He said he's different.
[04:46.57]He doesn't want to do it anymore.
[04:47.67]He doesn't want to be a one trick pony.
[04:49.59]He kind of went all over this.
[04:50.55]I was like, what are you talking?
[04:52.27]He started rambling about different recipes he was working on and hams and turkeys and shit.
[04:57.56]And I was like, I was like, just call me later.
[04:59.80]Like, you obviously kind of you're fucked up right now.

[05:40.25]STOP OPENING THE DOOR AND TRYING TO KILL ME!
[05:43.04]Wait a minute, I need to make sure this is on the right hand, because I- If you don't use VR for fucking 10 minutes, it turns everything off.

[13:12.10]If I drink a fucking Sprite on stream, how is that any different?
[13:15.72]It's the same thing.
[13:17.14]Should I just put tape on this?
[13:25.19]Cover it up.
[13:29.26]Go put electrical tape on this.
[13:31.76]No, if I put electrical tape on this, this is not... Truly, this is like some kind of weird fucking potion that I made.

[14:39.22]Wait.
[14:42.78]You have a colostomy bag on.
[14:53.10]Why is he taped up?
[14:54.18]Because it's like body tape.
[14:57.12]It's to support your muscles and back and chest.
[14:59.74]It's support tape.
[15:02.22]Got it?
[15:02.66]Already?
[15:03.62]Look, when I go in, I don't come out.
[15:04.78]Alright, this is not the filter I was talking about.

[15:59.39]What are you talking about?

[16:01.74]I'll show it.
[16:03.92]I'll show you.
[16:05.60]What do you mean I can't get 2,000 likes on Instagram?
[16:07.86]Are you kidding me?
[16:08.76]If I had an Instagram, it would be bloated with likes.
[16:10.82]Every like would be, it would be double liked.
[16:13.59]It'd be 10,000.
[16:14.13]Alright, I'm ready.
[16:17.69]Let's get, I'm going to, I'm just trying to finish my fucking blueberry and I almost just dropped it.

[20:02.70]You guys know that before YouTube and Twitch, I did not ever play scary games because I can't play them and I hate to play them.
[20:14.92]I am of a nervous disposition.
[20:16.88]I hate this.
[20:26.92]Name.
[20:28.40]But I have to be strong.

[20:54.55]Do-do-do-do-do.
[20:56.11]Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

[21:04.83]That's it, right?
[21:07.85]What?
[21:28.05]That was good.
[21:28.57]That was really good.
[21:33.85]You know, I know that was good.
[21:36.79]You can -2 it if you want.
[21:37.99]I wasn't trying to be funny.
[21:39.07]I was showing you how good I was.
[21:40.09]Alright, Satan Door.
[21:42.23]That was... I'm not ready for this part yet.
[21:57.54]I'm not ready for that yet.
[21:58.36]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[22:00.62]Let's see what's behind door number two.
[22:10.83]I don't want to go in there.

[22:21.58]Fuck off.
[22:22.92]What?
[22:30.36]Alright.
[22:31.64]I'm in the house.
[22:33.84]I went through door number two.
[22:34.78]Can't go up there.
[22:52.29]Imagine doing this in real life.
[22:54.16]Why would you ever do this in real life?
[22:57.40]They're like ghost hunters and shit.
[22:59.28]Stay fucking home!
[23:00.54]Stay home!
[23:04.64]That was horrible.
[23:07.48]Oh my god.
[23:08.52]I felt like my whole house exploded.
[23:13.07]Seven?
[23:13.41]Alright, this door is number seven.
[23:15.19]Remember that.
[23:21.97]Like, who cares if the place is haunted?
[23:24.91]Don't you think that's a little condescending to the ghost that's there?
[23:27.09]Like the ghost is just trying to exist in peace, and you're in there with like your fucking ectometer.
[23:32.55]Hey, can you hear us?
[23:36.47]Like, yeah, I can.
[23:37.91]Please get the fuck out of my house.
[23:39.12]I am of a nervous nervous disposition.
[23:54.65]That was a kid laughing in reverse.
[23:56.11]God damn it.

[24:40.93]Fuck.
[24:41.19]It's okay.
[24:41.59]What time is that?
[24:43.13]That would be... That's a six down there.
[24:46.12]Seven.
[24:46.28]That would be eight.
[24:47.18]That would be... Oh, no.
[24:48.98]That's not pointing that way.
[24:49.92]That's, uh... That would be one... That's one tenth.
[25:00.67]Come on.
[25:03.06]I'm kidding.
[25:03.66]It's fucking 10 o'clock.
[25:04.62]10-10.
[25:04.72]Leave me alone.
[25:16.59]Hey.
[25:17.35]I'm so jumpy tonight.
[25:22.89]Oh, it's a fucking Ouija board.
[25:24.17]Great.
[25:25.79]Fuck you.
[25:26.61]Don't do that.
[25:28.35]Okay, if that happens, you can't blame that on, like, your drunk friend.
[25:36.31]Ask it a question.
[25:39.20]What's your name?
[25:41.84]B?
[25:46.42]Holy shit, the fucking things are flying at me.
[25:51.32]That's what I'm gonna look like in an hour when I take the headset off.
[25:55.99]It's Abraham Lincoln.
[26:00.47]Don't come out of the painting!
[26:01.87]Don't come out of the painting.
[26:04.25]You were gonna come out of the fucking painting!
[26:11.54]Actually pretty fucking scary.
[26:13.16]What?
[26:13.34]I didn't get to play this thing.
[26:21.65]Lore grab.
[26:22.79]It was kind of a lore grab.
[26:24.47]Same face.
[26:26.29]Alright, I'm going left hand.
[26:29.37]Put it down!
[26:30.05]It's like interference.
[26:31.05]Is this a microphone?
[26:31.95]Don't- Let me pick a microphone up next to the speaker.
[26:36.25]You're supposed to be the audio guy.
[26:37.71]Fuck off.
[26:47.26]Ugh.
[26:47.38]Alright, I can't go that way.
[26:51.71]This sucks.
[26:55.81]Okay.
[27:02.45]It's only gonna be in the bed in about five seconds.
[27:07.27]I'm so glad that there are like 70,000 people here watching this.
[27:11.95]I know that you're here with me, so it's not as bad.
[27:13.83]Hey.
[27:33.02]I see a shadow.
[27:33.68]Is that my shadow or is that their shadow?
[27:35.48]Find out.
[27:39.56]Fine.
[27:47.99]Is that... Is it painting?
[27:49.73]I don't... I hate... I want like a gun or something.
[27:53.49]Or like a knife.
[27:55.15]Give me a weapon, please.
[28:01.17]It's gonna change.
[28:06.13]I don't... I'm waiting for it to change.
[28:11.35]Don't, please.
[28:17.52]Why would you have this shit in your house?
[28:18.88]Alright, I'm sorry.
[28:21.22]Is it weird for me to say that if you have paintings like this all over your house, you're a fucking psycho.
[28:26.53]Like these are fucking psychotic paintings.
[28:28.93]You can't, you don't relax in this house.
[28:31.01]Who relaxes and eats dinner here?
[28:33.01]Like you get chicken and rice and you sit there with like the pictures of people's heads being torn off.
[28:38.18]If you own pictures like this, you keep them like in a vault or something.
[28:41.08]You don't show them in your house.
[28:42.04]You can scare the fuck out of anybody.
[28:45.30]You can't have friends over with a painting like that.
[28:47.28]Because they're all going to come over.
[28:50.94]They're going to be like, oh dude, nice place.
[28:52.30]Cool.
[28:53.16]Oh, what is this?
[28:53.58]Hardwood floors?
[28:56.02]Oh, uh... Nice, man.
[29:00.38]You know what?
[29:00.82]I'm gonna order a lift.
[29:02.60]I'll meet you guys at the bar.
[29:07.68]That's an uncomfortable painting, man.
[29:12.29]What's this shit?
[29:13.05]Oh, I don't know.
[29:13.51]Is that your grandfather?
[29:15.41]No, no.
[29:15.95]I just collect old photos of strange people and scary people.
[29:21.07]You got a daughter?
[29:22.39]You got a son?
[29:24.05]Cool.
[29:24.59]Hey, my name's Mike.
[29:27.00]I'm your dad's friend.
[29:27.80]No, no, no, don't go up there.
[29:34.66]Don't go up there.
[29:35.34]Nah, it's all good, man.

[34:40.55]And then she would just eat my soul.
[34:49.15]I would home alone myself in that scenario.
[34:56.58]Hey, look how hard I can, five more months of what?
[35:03.87]Dying in a pool of his own piss.
[35:08.72]I don't dream of that.
[35:09.58]I'm just saying that's a realistic scenario.
[35:19.35]Get the phone.
[35:19.75]Someone in the bed?
[35:34.47]Shut that up!
[35:37.29]Oh, that's horrifying.
[35:38.65]Why do you have all this?
[35:41.78]You're fucking scary.
[35:43.78]You're scary if you have all this stuff.
[35:46.28]I can't turn it off.
[35:50.53]Get out!
[36:06.92]I'm gonna need... I think I'm gonna need some truly power after this.
[36:10.20]Why does it always have to be a little girl?
[36:24.45]You know, is that... Is it ever just gonna be like an armadillo or something?

[36:54.72]I got hurt.
[36:55.58]I got hurt because I'm holding two giant ice cream cones.
[37:00.43]I don't know why they made them like this in the first place.
[37:02.93]Why did they make them like this in the first place?
[37:14.14]It's like, why make them just huge fishing rods?
[37:19.55]I gotta get the index control, it's bad.
[37:21.47]Because if you get too close like this, you're gonna smash.
[37:25.43]Alright, I'm holding my hands out wide like this from now on.
[37:46.24]He took my, what?
[37:48.36]Why did my flashlight just disintegrate?
[37:51.22]I don't have any defense against the Dark Ops.
[38:05.79]Yeah, come on down to my man cave.
[38:07.27]I've got a stadium seating.
[38:10.01]Yeah, don't mind all this shit.
[38:12.11]Yeah, no, no, it's all good.
[38:13.31]This is just books about, like, witches and murdering people and, like, burning, like, children and stuff.
[38:18.26]No, no, that's just my great uncle.
[38:20.24]Don't worry about that.
[38:22.50]He was a blacksmith.
[38:24.32]Yeah.
[38:25.28]Come on down, though.
[38:26.10]Yeah, yeah.
[38:26.90]Patriots are on in ten minutes.
[38:28.92]Come on down.
[38:29.52]Let's go.
[38:29.92]No one has a house like this.
[38:40.91]Those are my hands.
[38:50.20]That's going to look at me.
[38:54.58]I know you're going to look at me.
[38:55.70]That fucking Napoleon statue is going to turn and be like...
[39:13.47]I knew you were gonna be there.
[39:14.67]That's why I didn't like that.
[39:16.24]That's why I didn't like that.
[39:22.16]Don't move.
[39:26.13]Just a little further.
[39:28.37]Yeah, I swear to God, I got an 80-inch TV in here.
[39:31.33]Don't worry about it.
[39:32.27]Fuck all that stuff.
[39:34.89]I gotta get the cleaners in here.
[39:44.30]Why would you have all this?
[39:45.25]Good night.
[39:50.91]That big fuck is gonna do something.
[40:09.59]The Joker.
[40:18.77]This is a really long hallway.
[40:19.99]You know how I can tell this thing's mouth is going to open?
[40:25.43]Because look at the animatable lines that are right on his mouth.
[40:30.11]One.
[40:30.93]Two.
[40:33.75]Three.
[40:43.92]Don't do it!
[40:57.07]I'm just getting hit with various pieces of wood into my back.
[41:02.32]That's what this game is.
[41:05.13]I have a blindfold on and somebody is going to my back and say, you ready?
[41:09.51]When I don't know what's going to happen.
[41:10.97]They count to three and do it on two.
[41:30.86]That's not a bad picture.
[41:31.90]Whatever.
[41:32.24]This house is huge.
[41:47.57]Okay.
[41:57.83]Come on, piano, gotta save us here.
[41:59.37]Piano, gotta save us, piano.
[42:11.45]Ah!

[42:14.27]Are you sure?
[42:15.39]Yeah, yeah, I can take it, man.
[42:19.87]I did that pretty fucking hard, Jeremy.
[42:21.72]Fucking do it again!
[42:43.38]With veiny arms?
[42:46.40]His blood is just fucking flowing through me right now.
[43:03.77]Oh, stop.
[43:04.51]Get out of here.
[43:07.45]Go back to that TV show that ended like 15 years... What was that show?
[43:11.43]I don't remember what it was.
[43:13.22]Just flying, whatever.
[43:14.42]Go back, go back to that TV show.
[43:20.61]Pretty cool.
[43:47.53]Alright, just gotta make it to the door.
[43:54.08]Make it to the door.
[43:55.68]Make it to the door.
[44:06.60]I gotta be ready.

[44:08.29]Beep!
[44:15.09]Did you open?
[44:21.20]Oh, you dropped all the stuff.
[44:23.10]I don't have a flashlight though, this is bad.
[44:28.34]That was the playing music in the beginning, right?
[44:45.27]Ooh, tense.
[44:51.40]That's just too, it's just my whole body is in contractions.
[44:56.80]I'm having contractions.
[45:12.85]Earth, he's gonna be, he's pregnant.
[45:20.17]Nice.
[45:22.84]Get the fuck out of here with this bullshit.
[45:24.34]Get out of here with this bullshit.
[45:25.90]If I was pregnant, I would get Disney World.
[45:29.46]That's how it works.
[45:41.91]You guys ever heard that weird, like, conspiracy theory?
[45:56.36]Yeah, somebody has.
[45:57.12]It's an urban legend.
[46:12.52]Right, yeah, yeah.
[46:14.12]Well, whatever.
[46:26.95]Open.
[46:28.75]There's nothing else at the end of this.
[46:40.79]Get the fuck away from me or you're gonna... Oh, I know what to do.
[46:48.93]I can just close my eyes and you guys won't even know I'm closing my eyes.
[46:53.71]That's a huge big brain moment.
[46:55.29]I could just close my eyes.
[46:59.68]When I know something really scary is going to happen, I'll just close my eyes.
[47:14.01]One of these is going to take off.
[47:17.67]One of those is coming off.
[47:24.16]My body is so hot and sweaty right now.
[47:31.90]You know that one of these is coming off and they're gonna drop at me.
[48:03.58]Did I lose?
[48:07.33]Jesus.
[48:14.51]What the hell would the gauntlet be?
[48:21.52]No one survives this way.
[48:23.52]Is the gauntlet just various jump scares that scream at you?
[48:28.42]I'm just curious.
[48:30.60]I just want to know what it is.
[48:31.74]What's the gauntlet?
[48:35.84]It's gonna be just screams in your face.
[48:40.88]Instructions.
[48:41.70]Hold the trigger to accelerate.

[55:05.52]I don't know where that came from.
[55:11.08]I swear, I don't know.
[55:11.94]This is like a weird urban legend.
[55:21.84]Yo, what the fuck?
[55:22.52]I'm just telling you this is an urban legend from like 30 years ago.
[55:28.29]Why do I have to click on all these bicycles?
[55:29.87]Google, what are you talking about?
[55:30.81]Click on the bicycles to verify you're on a robot?

[55:54.33]Why would he want that?
[55:56.13]I don't know.
[55:56.61]I didn't make this up.
[55:58.01]This is just something I was like, what the fuck?
[55:59.53]What does that mean?
[56:00.11]It was debunked.
[56:02.68]Okay, it was debunked.
[56:08.32]Whatever.
[56:08.72]I'm not saying that this is a factual statement.
[56:13.47]Alright.

[56:45.91]I gotta do it in here.
[56:47.37]Every time I try to do this, I break it.
[56:48.70]So I'm not breaking it this time.
[56:50.52]We're doing Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted.
[56:52.46]That's coming up next.
[56:56.62]I have to go... So I don't break anything.
[56:58.72]I have to go to the home.
[57:01.90]So I have to go to home.
[57:09.07]Uh...
[57:10.94]Exit game.
[57:12.30]There it is.
[57:12.88]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[57:15.00]I don't have to exit anything.
[57:17.42]We're still in VR.
[57:20.16]I practiced this, guys, before I turned the stream on like three days ago.
[57:25.31]Next up is Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted.
[57:27.41]Here it comes.
[57:28.71]Nice.
[57:28.97]Alright.
[57:29.39]That was easy.
[57:39.16]Am I still streaming?
[57:39.80]What the fuck happened?
[57:41.34]Wait, what?
[57:45.62]Let's go.
[57:45.92]Hold on, I gotta change the, uh... Gotta change the game we're playing.
[57:52.26]Is this game actually any good or is this a meme?
[57:53.94]Is this just a meme game?
[58:01.24]Tell me now.
[58:03.75]Alright, Five Nights at Freddy's VR.
[58:12.07]Why is my computer crashed?
[58:14.63]Help wanted, right?
[58:15.91]How many Five Nights at Freddy's games are there?
[58:18.75]Is it a Minions game?
[58:21.51]Minions.
[58:22.09]Five Nights at the Despicable Hospital 3D.
[58:29.34]What?
[58:30.32]Why is that on Twitch's directory?
[58:33.88]Should I play that?
[58:36.28]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[58:39.60]Help Wanted.
[58:40.12]There it is.
[58:42.96]This doesn't have an icon.
[58:49.71]Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted.
[58:50.59]Did it change?
[58:50.99]I want to make sure I'm in the right category, otherwise I'm going to be in big fucking trouble.
[58:56.99]Alright, we're good.
[58:59.62]Let's go.
[59:02.03]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[59:03.71]VR.
[59:05.03]See you in the game.
[59:06.63]Wait, I need a little bit more.
[59:07.93]I need to drink a little more.
[59:08.73]I need to wipe this because it's fucking disgusting.
[59:15.93]Fog.
[59:16.67]I'm sure it is.
[59:17.15]This is the first time I've played a Five Nights at Freddy's game since Demon Lords of Raxos made that awful video that I refused to delete for principle.
[59:31.47]This is the first time I've played one in a long time.
[59:39.95]Okay, hold on.
[59:43.41]Are we good?
[59:48.37]Help wanted.
[59:48.95]Shit, I forgot to drink.
[60:05.85]I need like a helmet that feeds it to me.
[60:07.47]Alright, let's go.
[60:21.87]I thought that said bad game.
[60:23.79]Let's do it.
[60:28.04]Minions.
[60:28.42]Five nights at Despicable Hospital.
[60:29.90]When?
[60:30.46]Never.
[60:30.70]How do I walk?
[60:44.85]General.
[60:46.53]General.
[60:48.63]General.
[60:50.81]Subtitles on.
[60:53.17]How do I walk?
[60:55.92]I can't like, this isn't the Bronx.
[60:58.02]I'm hitting the microphone.
[61:06.92]The legs are broken.
[61:09.88]Can I not make this move?
[61:15.64]New game.
[61:19.02]Uh, uh, hello?
[61:20.54]Hello?
[61:22.70]Welcome to the Freddy Fazbear virtual experience.
[61:26.18]Fazbear Entertainment is excited to join the digital age, and what better way to do that than with an edge-of-your-seat virtual reality experience?
[61:40.12]Is this cringe?
[61:40.76]Oh, Freddy!
[61:41.06]Freddy!
[61:42.46]That's not Freddy.
[61:43.13]That's a guy.
[62:03.89]That's Happy and Hoppy.
[62:05.05]Foxy and Hoppy.
[62:05.71]That's Foxy.
[62:06.49]Put a Truly.
[62:07.11]Put a Truly over there and put a filter on it.
[62:09.93]That's the same picture I took.
[62:29.61]We do, however, ask that you agree to a simple waiver before you play.
[62:33.91]It's mostly just legal mumbo jumbo and isn't at all based on user experiences thus far.
[62:39.29]Volumes low?
[62:39.53]Got you.
[62:39.71]Got you.
[62:39.87]Got you.
[62:40.05]Got you.
[63:00.44]Got ya!
[63:00.64]Oh no, the nose thing is fucked up.
[63:18.10]Welcome to the Freddy Fazbear virtual experience.
[63:22.03]Use the console in front of you to navigate the menu and pick one of the frightening experiences available.
[63:28.47]By completing these scenarios, more will become available.
[63:32.06]You'll see plenty of familiar faces and some new ones as well.
[63:35.76]So stay a while and have a good time.
[63:38.78]And remember, despite the temporary horror you may experience, this is a completely controlled environment, and you aren't in any real danger.
[63:47.01]Fazbear Entertainment not responsible for real danger.
[63:49.21]Unless you're using the ice cream cone fuckin' Vive controllers.
[63:53.99]Can I move?
[63:54.65]How do I move forward?
[63:55.57]This is... not right.
[64:06.13]Don't.
[64:08.12]I have standing room only selected from my Vive.
[64:13.45]Go forward from here?
[64:14.41]Does it get like all up in your face?
[64:17.55]There's no moving.
[64:20.33]Okay, how about Candy?
[64:26.30]Okay, Showtime.
[64:27.40]What's this?
[64:27.80]Night 1?
[64:28.16]Night 1.
[64:29.90]Whatever, let's just do Night 1.
[64:30.94]Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[64:31.92]Five Nights at Freddy's Push Buttons.
[64:37.39]Okay.
[64:40.49]Push buttons.
[64:48.37]Wait, this is- this is- he's gonna do it!
[64:58.12]Oh, fuck!
[64:59.36]I don't- I- Oh, I don't wanna do- Wait, I forget- don't touch anything, right?
[65:04.16]How do I turn the cameras off?
[65:14.58]Oh, door!
[65:15.72]No, light!
[65:17.02]No!
[65:29.01]I play this game with both doors closed permanently.
[65:33.45]I've never won Five Nights at Freddy's because I don't keep- I close the doors permanently.
[65:41.21]Where is he?
[65:42.03]Where's Freddy?
[65:43.01]Where's Freddy?
[65:44.17]What's happening?
[66:12.96]Close the fucking doors.
[66:13.79]Keep them all closed.
[66:14.67]I'd probably be a bit irritable at night, too.
[66:20.37]So remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children.
[66:25.27]Dude, why do I have to get so close?
[66:28.48]So just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit.
[66:33.34]They're left in some kind of groovy roaming mode at night.
[66:42.07]Oh, there they are.
[66:42.87]That's like Ernie.
[66:43.71]That's not Freddy.
[66:45.03]That's Ernie.
[66:45.93]Where are the others?
[67:11.72]This is just the kitchen's disabled, why?
[67:15.16]Oh shit!
[67:15.76]He's right there!
[67:17.04]Good thing I have the door closed!
[67:20.16]He's literally right here!
[67:40.56]Purple guy.
[67:42.28]What?

[67:42.66]Is he there?
[68:12.25]Alright, what time?
[68:12.81]What's the time?
[68:13.43]What time do I leave?
[68:14.61]Alright, I gotta... Shit!
[68:20.67]Get out of here!

[69:44.02]It's gonna be 6AM.
[69:48.87]No power in night one.
[69:50.51]I haven't... Holy shitties right there.
[69:53.11]I haven't played this game in like seven years.
[69:55.33]Look at me!
[70:11.40]I did it!
[70:11.80]Claim your prize.
[70:24.78]Oh, I got a chicken!

[70:35.51]Five Nights at Freddy's, wait, how many... Light of two, three, dark rooms, parts and services, vent repair, night terrors, what is all this?
[70:49.44]Prize counter?
[70:52.28]Is this every game?
[70:55.85]This looks kinda cool.
[70:58.09]How many coins do I have?
[70:58.73]Alright, what should I get?
[71:10.11]Four?
[71:10.37]Eh, I don't have enough for anything.
[71:14.56]Okay, we're gonna do... We're gonna do knight two.
[71:24.96]Bushtrap?
[71:25.92]Dark?
[71:26.22]Why don't we just go in order?
[71:28.60]Night 2.
[71:28.98]Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[71:35.93]I get it now.
[71:36.51]I get it.
[71:36.83]It's been a while.
[71:42.73]Here we go.
[71:44.94]They stay backstage.
[71:46.92]They move around.
[71:47.78]There's like... Okay, there's that.
[71:51.16]Don't spam buttons either.
[71:54.91]Well, if you're hearing this and you made it to day two, congrats.
[71:58.91]I won't talk quite as long this time since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active in the week and progressive.
[72:06.09]They do?
[72:06.85]It might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone's in their proper place, you know.
[72:13.76]Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come on stage very often.
[72:18.46]I've heard he becomes a lot more active in the
[72:24.91]I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights.
[72:30.85]There are blind spots in your camera view.
[72:34.33]And those blind spots have to be right outside the door.
[72:37.13]So if you can't find something or someone on your camera, be sure to check your door light.
[72:45.37]You might only have a few seconds to react.
[72:48.77]Not that you would be in any danger, of course.
[72:51.25]I'm not implying that.
[73:00.44]Oh shit, alright, you're in the supply room.
[73:03.10]You're fine.
[73:30.44]Where's the chicken?
[73:32.96]Okay, there's Freddy.
[73:34.66]You're back there.
[73:36.40]Where's the chicken?
[73:38.12]Alright, chicken's coming down the hall.
[73:39.98]Chicken's coming down the hall right now.
[73:43.38]Chicken's coming.
[73:46.16]Who are you?
[73:47.32]Chicken coming?
[73:48.04]Chicken's coming down the hall.
[73:52.51]Where's Freddy?
[73:54.09]What do I do about that?
[73:54.85]What do I do about that?
[73:55.53]The alien.
[73:56.71]What do I do about the alien guy?
[73:59.04]HOLY SHIT!
[73:59.78]THEY MOVE IN THIS ONE!
[74:00.66]THEY MOVE IN THE- THEY- IT'S SCOT- Cawthorn actually animated him.
[74:05.84]They actually animated in this one.
[74:06.92]They're not just like fucking bitmap images.
[74:08.69]Okay, that's scary.
[74:15.69]They're right there.
[74:16.83]Get the fuck outta- Are you still here?
[74:20.97]What's his name?
[74:25.58]Shit, I'm running out of power.
[74:29.69]I think I can open this.
[74:30.67]Get out.
[74:35.67]Is the chicken gone?
[74:36.39]Chicken's gone.
[74:39.47]Open that back up.
[74:41.31]Chicken's gone.
[74:42.89]You here?
[74:43.15]Where's the chicken?
[74:45.88]Chicken gone?
[74:46.30]Where's the chicken?
[74:48.26]Who's over here?
[74:48.90]Can I hear you?
[74:49.82]You here?
[74:51.94]You here?
[74:54.06]3 AM.
[74:54.18]We're good.
[74:55.28]He's right there.
[74:56.10]He's right there.
[74:56.52]This motherfucker's right here.
[75:00.03]Alright, chicken's coming back.
[75:03.34]Chicken's coming back.
[75:07.48]He's right there still.
[75:08.24]Fuck this guy.
[75:13.26]What was that?
[75:14.94]What was that noise?
[75:17.17]What's that noise?
[75:17.73]What's going on?
[75:18.23]Who's moving?
[75:18.77]Hello?
[75:19.45]What was that?
[75:23.37]Left?
[75:27.53]I heard somebody ram into a door.
[75:35.58]Shit!
[75:36.46]You're right here.
[75:37.16]Get away from me.
[75:49.73]Don't move.
[75:51.33]Fuck.
[75:54.69]I think this is safe to open.
[75:55.71]Hey, keep this one closed.
[76:02.02]Keep that one closed.
[76:02.76]Is he here?
[76:05.57]Freddy?
[76:09.81]Freddy?
[76:10.37]Freddy?
[76:10.99]Freddy?
[76:11.55]Okay, I got 5 a.m.
[76:14.04]Just... Leave me alone!
[76:20.56]6 a.m.
[76:21.96]6 a.m.
[76:22.64]6 a.m.
[76:45.66]I hate this game.
[76:54.30]I just spit all over myself because I didn't know that he was going to be up under my face and in my nose.
[77:01.35]I thought he was going to jump this way.
[77:03.39]So when I was looking down like this and he was here like underneath, like under the water,
[77:11.21]Peek into the hallway?
[77:12.05]Go ahead.
[77:14.25]I can peek down the hallway.
[77:17.67]Holy shit, really?
[77:58.87]So that's there so you can't cheat.
[78:04.07]Holy moly.
[78:11.52]God help us.
[78:19.00]I'm going to need a second.
[78:20.22]I did not think that was going to happen.
[78:23.79]Down the fucking hallway.
[78:31.82]my god scream like a monkey that was that was the worst rng you possibly could have gotten what it was rng well that's like a you're peaking you're cheating so we're gonna end the game
[79:03.77]What?
[79:05.53]What do you mean, no, it's not?
[79:06.97]It went even two seconds in the second level of the first game.
[79:11.58]I would again and find out.
[79:28.97]I fucking knew it.
[79:33.98]Bad RNG.
[79:35.26]Do it again.
[79:35.88]I don't want to do that one anymore.
[79:42.38]I don't like this.
[79:43.08]I hate this.
[79:44.68]It's too stressful for me.
[79:45.72]I want to do the other ones.
[79:47.68]Where's the one with like the others?
[79:49.12]Let's do Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[80:03.77]Oh, this one's even worse.
[80:08.75]I'm gonna hit the desk.
[80:10.77]Oh, this sucks.
[80:13.11]Oh, this sucks.
[80:13.53]Won't you have to, like, wind up a toy in this?
[80:34.37]Don't I have like a mask I can put on?
[80:38.41]Where's my mask?
[80:39.07]You actually have to put the mask on.
[80:41.07]I'm gonna smash my hand.
[80:42.59]But most importantly...
[81:02.11]They're all tied into some kind of criminal database, so they can detect a predator a mile away.
[81:07.70]And we should detect a predator too.
[81:10.72]Uh, that's bad.
[81:11.50]So a new system is without its kinks.
[81:14.83]Uh, you're only the second guard to work at that location.
[81:18.39]Uh, the first guy finished his week, but complained about conditions.
[81:22.33]Uh, we switched him over to the day shift.
[81:25.48]So, hey, lucky you, right?
[81:27.50]Oh, this is the... Hello!
[81:28.42]Oh, this is the bone, the foxy bone one.
[81:57.56]So our temporary solution is this.
[81:59.72]There's a music box over by the prize counter, and it's rigged to be wound up remotely.
[82:04.63]So just every once in a while, switch over to the prize counter video feed and wind it up for a few seconds.
[82:11.09]It doesn't seem to affect all of the animatronics, but it does affect one of them.
[82:16.91]That's this little weirdo, the little weirdo jumping guy.
[82:19.38]You see, there may be a minor glitch.
[82:27.21]I hear something.
[82:28.57]I hear something.
[82:29.39]How do I fucking hear something?
[82:31.17]Oh shit!

[86:51.39]Where did he go?
[86:53.88]Where's that fucking Bunny?
[86:54.88]He has to be in one of these rooms.
[87:00.02]Didn't he leave from here?
[87:15.20]Where's the bunny?
[87:15.80]Okay, bunny and chicken are both gone.
[87:17.82]Alright, chicken's up here.
[87:19.62]Bunny, where are you at?
[87:20.96]Where's this bunny?
[87:21.46]Where's this fucking bunny?
[87:26.56]Bunny!
[87:29.06]Chicken.
[87:29.90]Chicken up here.
[87:31.14]Bunny, right there.
[87:32.11]Alright, I got some-
[87:44.44]Okay, wait, chicken?
[87:45.76]Where's the chicken?
[87:46.22]Where'd the chicken go?
[87:48.00]Where's the chicken?
[87:51.21]Where the fuck is the chicken?
[87:52.13]Where's the chicken?
[87:52.67]Where the fuck is the chicken?
[87:53.65]Where's the chicken?
[87:54.89]Where's the chicken?
[87:56.35]Where's the chicken?
[87:56.93]Alright, there's the bunny.
[88:08.20]Bunny right here.
[88:08.78]You're coming down here.
[88:09.46]I see you.
[88:10.88]Okay, they're both creeping on me.
[88:11.92]They're both about to fucking creep on my ass.
[88:14.78]I got you.
[88:15.18]I got you.
[88:15.58]You can't... Okay, you're moving.
[88:16.68]On the move.
[88:17.00]Where you going?
[88:17.92]You're on the move.
[88:18.32]You're in the vent right now.
[88:19.68]You're in the vent right now.
[88:20.34]Where are you?
[88:22.82]You're in the vent right now.
[88:28.44]Get away.
[88:28.80]Get away.
[88:30.68]You're in the vent right now.
[88:31.63]Get away from me.
[88:34.21]You're in the vent.
[88:34.89]When did you come in?
[88:43.03]Get fucking out of here.
[88:47.91]Where'd you go?
[88:53.63]I lost the headphone.
[88:56.33]Where's the chicken?
[88:57.07]Where's the chicken?
[88:57.87]Where's the bunny?
[88:58.75]Where's the bunny?
[88:59.47]Where's the chicken?
[88:59.87]Where's the bunny?
[89:08.00]Bunny's back.
[89:09.50]We're good.
[89:11.58]Not in any danger anymore.
[89:15.96]The fuck is going on?
[89:22.79]Oh shit, they're in the back.
[89:25.85]Okay.
[89:26.33]COME ON!
[90:05.83]We're good.
[90:08.31]We're good.
[90:18.17]I want to drink that truly so bad right now, you have no idea.
[90:27.66]Mixed nuts.
[90:28.64]Allergy friendly.
[90:36.54]Are you having fun yet?
[90:37.96]That's great to hear.
[90:39.16]That's pretty good.
[90:40.42]It's actually pretty fun.
[90:41.80]If you like Five Nights at Freddy's, I mean, this is just that, but... Ten times worse.
[90:46.64]No, I would say a hundred times worse.
[90:49.44]For your, like, anxiety.
[90:50.68]That's what I'm doing.
[90:55.32]Look, I'm never going to beat Night 2 or 3.
[91:01.12]Sit down, dude.
[91:01.82]It's way better.
[91:02.44]Uh...
[91:07.42]I mean, that does make sense to sit down.
[91:11.42]I know.
[91:11.70]Look out for Foxy.
[91:13.09]He'll sprint at you.
[91:14.13]Uh, hello?
[91:14.37]Hello?
[91:18.03]Uh, see, I told you your first night wouldn't be a problem.
[91:21.86]You're a natural.
[91:23.34]Uh, by now I'm sure you've noticed the older models sitting in the back room.
[91:28.60]Those are from the previous location, and we just use them for parts now.
[91:32.78]The idea at first was to repair them.
[91:35.73]They even started retrofitting them with some of the newer technology.
[91:39.11]But they were just so ugly, you know, and the smell.
[91:42.01]So the company decided to just go in a whole new direction and make them super kid-friendly.
[91:49.18]Those older ones shouldn't be able to walk around, but if they do, the whole Freddy head trick should work on them too, so whatever.
[91:57.20]Come on, do it!
[91:59.38]I love those old characters.
[92:01.28]Uh, did you ever see Foxy the Pirate?
[92:03.62]Oh wait, Foxy.
[92:05.08]Oh yeah, Foxy.
[92:06.48]Uh, hey listen.
[92:07.68]Uh, that one was always a bit twitchy.
[92:09.58]I'm not sure if the Freddy head trick will work on Foxy.
[92:13.70]What do I do with Foxy?
[92:14.57]If for some reason he activates during the night.
[92:17.27]Shit, I lost the chicken.
[92:18.01]See him standing at the far end of the hall?
[92:22.38]Who am I missing?
[92:23.62]Where's Foxy?
[92:24.66]Hello?
[92:25.04]Hello?
[92:52.38]Hello?
[92:53.10]Am I good?
[92:58.75]Are you good?
[93:05.83]We're good.
[93:08.47]Okay.
[93:08.81]Chicken's coming down left hallway here.
[93:12.98]Hello?
[93:13.40]What does that mean?
[93:18.46]It's the balloon kid.
[93:20.30]Alright, Balloon Kid is currently in the vent right now.
[93:22.46]What do I do?
[93:23.22]Shine a light in his eyes.
[93:23.88]Is that what you do?
[93:25.36]What do you do?
[93:27.64]Do I shine a light in his eyes?
[93:28.58]The mask will work on... Hey, you little fuck.
[93:42.37]Alright, he's gone?
[93:42.95]Is he gone?
[93:44.17]Get back on.
[93:46.27]Where is he?
[93:46.95]What?
[93:53.83]You're in the fucking bed too!
[94:02.34]Get away from me!
[94:09.15]Get away from me!
[94:13.25]Leave!
[94:14.43]Leave!
[94:15.85]Leave!
[94:17.01]Leave!
[94:17.45]Leave!
[94:18.09]Leave!
[94:18.35]What's that?
[94:18.81]I saw somebody else!
[94:19.99]Leave!
[94:24.23]Shine the light in his face!
[94:32.43]Get away from me, Freddy!
[94:34.10]Is he still there?
[94:34.76]He's fucking still there!
[94:57.06]Freddy!
[94:58.36]Leave me the fuck alone, Freddy!
[95:09.76]Is he gone?
[95:10.74]Why won't you leave me alone, Freddy?
[95:13.18]Leave me alone, Freddy!
[95:14.12]Hey, hey, hey!
[95:28.95]Where the fuck is he?
[95:29.53]Where is he?
[95:31.97]Okay.
[95:32.21]Hey!
[95:32.93]Hey!
[95:36.80]Alright, now... Get this fucking thing off and pull this thing!
[96:11.76]Ring it.
[96:13.12]Ring it.
[96:13.74]Ring it.
[96:14.00]Holy fuck, I didn't even mean to do that.
[96:16.51]I won.
[96:32.37]Gamer instinct.
[96:40.55]Stick of butter.
[96:41.11]Stick of butter.
[96:43.15]I don't know why we have a stick of butter.
[96:47.92]Oh.
[96:54.38]Game for babies.
[96:55.56]Oh.
[96:58.01]Oh.
[97:00.44]Night 3.
[97:01.04]Do I dare even attempt Night 3?
[97:04.15]Sure.
[97:06.31]If I'm gonna... I mean, I'm gonna go... This is where the game gets real, right?
[97:10.41]I'm now out of the tutorial.
[97:11.81]I know how it works.
[97:12.47]Goddamn stone cold.
[97:22.26]This is where the real game begins.
[97:23.76]Yeah.
[97:35.81]Yeah, I think so.
[97:38.21]Foxy did appear in the hallway.
[97:41.01]Chicken's already gone.
[97:43.35]Where's Chicken?
[97:44.03]Chicken in here?
[98:06.40]Where did you go?
[98:07.26]Hey, get out of here, man!
[98:08.62]Get out of here, man!
[98:37.28]Come on, man!
[98:38.88]Get out of here, man!
[98:39.98]Dude.
[98:40.18]What?
[98:40.28]Who?
[98:40.58]You?
[98:40.78]Where?
[98:41.16]How?
[98:41.50]This person there is... Shit.
[99:13.78]Where's the bird?
[99:15.68]Where's the... Where's the... Yes!
[99:25.25]Yeah!
[99:48.18]Chicken?
[99:49.92]How did you get through my shield?
[99:59.21]How did you get through my shield?
[100:01.35]I had a shield.
[100:01.97]What?
[100:04.07]What happened?
[100:05.31]How did you get through the shield?
[100:06.35]How did you get through the shield?
[100:16.38]Foxy is defeated by the flashlight.
[100:18.22]Oh, right, you have to like, nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh, and he'll go away.
[100:20.94]Alright, let's go back to the main video.
[100:29.12]Every jumpscare, I get electrocuted with 200 volts.
[100:34.22]That's just what your body does.
[100:35.77]I've been able to- fuck, I'm gonna change the title of this stream.
[100:39.65]To watch a guy get electrocuted over and over again.
[100:43.73]You know what, if anyone wanted to make like a compilation of all the jumpscares, but put like a... Like electricity noise before it.
[100:50.08]This guy is shocking himself.
[100:59.96]What happened?
[101:06.52]Oy vey.
[101:11.56]From a race car?
[101:12.58]I don't know what that is.
[101:15.85]Uh, get me out of here.
[101:23.52]Hello?
[101:28.90]What happened?
[101:30.20]Shut it down.
[101:35.57]Shut it down.
[101:36.13]No escape.
[101:36.63]Would you recommend it against sleepiness?
[101:39.29]What?
[101:40.25]Did I have to break?
[101:47.67]Shut it down.
[101:54.37]How do I leap?
[101:59.82]Restart?
[102:01.10]No.
[102:02.04]Uh, okay.
[102:04.00]Start it?
[102:04.68]Restart the game?
[102:09.70]That button.
[102:13.64]Where's that button?
[102:16.36]Uh...
[102:19.21]Or I'd restart.
[102:21.49]Library, store, exit game, and then just restart it.
[102:25.44]I lost you guys.
[102:32.52]Oh, what?
[102:32.84]Shut it down.
[102:39.18]Exit, yeah, hold on, let me just exit.
[102:47.20]Oh, here we go.
[102:47.80]Okay, just open it back up.
[102:50.95]Hey, there we go.
[102:55.98]Turn off your PC.
[102:56.94]What's wrong with this chat?
[103:03.34]What do you mean?
[103:05.02]Uh, wait.
[103:09.18]Launch.
[103:16.38]First gamer moment of 2020.
[103:17.44]Why?
[103:17.72]What do you mean?
[103:19.88]What happened?
[103:27.92]Yeah, relax.
[103:28.74]What?
[103:30.52]He actually did it, Omega Lull.
[103:32.02]What are you talking about?
[103:32.90]What did I do wrong?
[103:40.70]Continue.
[103:41.40]Alright, let's try the other ones.
[103:50.44]So that was two.
[103:51.18]This is three.
[103:54.09]Um, I have this weird memory of Five Nights at Freddy's 3 being terrible.
[103:59.42]This is the one that sucks, right?
[104:05.65]Yes.
[104:06.65]Kind of.
[104:06.93]Yeah, well, I mean, might as well see it.
[104:11.25]What's the one where you're in the bedroom, and you're like the little kid in the bedroom?
[104:20.10]Hey, hey, glad you came back for another night.
[104:22.98]I promise it'll be a lot more interesting this time.
[104:26.44]We found some great new relics over the weekend.
[104:29.56]They were out tracking down in two weeks.
[104:31.46]What do I do?
[104:32.68]Close the light?
[104:33.88]Close the vent.
[104:35.19]I press that button.
[104:36.19]Hey, man.
[104:36.53]Hey, Bart, come on into the bus, man.
[104:38.93]Totally, man.
[104:39.53]I'll get you to school on time.
[104:50.56]announce the exit.
[104:51.72]Yeah, you've officially become part of the attraction.
[104:55.24]You'll be starring as the security guard.
[104:59.42]So not only will you be monitoring the people on the cameras... I like this one because the screen is bigger.
[105:04.86]...steals anything or makes out of the corner, but you'll also be a part of the show.
[105:10.33]It'll make you feel really authentic, I think.
[105:12.81]Now let me tell you about what's new.
[105:15.83]We found another set of drawings with knives and a foxy head
[105:21.02]Is there a light I can put in here?
[105:28.85]Oh yeah, this one sucks.
[105:33.05]It's the bunny that comes... Yeah, this one's not good.
[105:35.81]I don't like it.
[105:36.17]This one sucks.
[105:38.84]I played this on iPad, and I was like, this game sucks.
[105:41.14]Alright, where is that?
[105:42.03]New error.
[106:07.08]Security cameras over to your right with the click of that blue button.
[106:11.08]You can toggle between the hall cams and the vent cams.
[106:14.18]What's going on?
[106:15.02]Then over to your far left.
[106:16.22]Did I already lose?
[106:17.14]You can flip up your maintenance panel.
[106:19.91]Did I lose already?
[106:20.95]Any systems that may go offline.
[106:24.55]In trying to make the place feel vintage, we may have overdone it a bit.
[106:28.95]Some of this equipment is barely functional.
[106:31.92]I wasn't joking about the fire.
[106:33.98]That's a real risk.
[106:36.74]What happened?
[106:37.32]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:38.68]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:40.72]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:41.76]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:43.34]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:44.54]What's happening?
[106:45.20]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:46.22]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:47.24]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:48.38]He's gonna scream in my face, man!
[106:49.92]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:51.52]He's gonna scream in my face!
[106:53.60]Where is he?
[107:21.49]Hello?
[107:25.74]There he is.
[107:26.94]There he is, that bastard.
[107:41.92]Hey!
[107:52.80]Nothing happens on night one.
[107:54.20]Oh.
[107:56.34]Well, let's... I at least want to see him walk by the screen.
[107:59.40]We gotta see it at least once, right?
[108:01.82]Hey, happy Halloween, by the way.
[108:02.84]Don't eat too much candy.
[108:11.23]Hey, is it dark out yet?
[108:12.19]No.
[108:14.81]Fuck, it's not even dark out.
[108:17.50]I have this, like, big, bright orange light that I want to put on.
[108:20.20]Oh, look at that.
[108:20.84]It's very...
[108:29.86]Graphics.
[108:37.29]We went to great lengths to create an authentic VR experience, including using scanned photographs for reference and using original performance routines where applicable.
[108:47.01]Alright, let's at least see the monster in Five Nights at Freddy's 3.
[108:52.66]Oh, you're getting something that you've always wanted.
[108:56.78]I'm playing every Five Nights at Freddy's game.

[109:32.20]There he is.
[109:59.54]What the fuck was that for, man?
[110:01.87]What the hell happened?
[110:04.09]Why'd you do that?
[110:05.59]That's not even funny.
[110:30.52]I believe it's broken.

[111:46.49]I'm not playing this one again.
[111:47.53]I'm doing the next one.
[111:48.67]Fuck this one.
[111:50.67]That hurt my body.
[112:02.88]Hair?
[112:15.18]This overexposed camera too.
[112:17.10]Hey, who ordered the pizza?
[112:23.37]Who ordered the bird's nest?
[112:39.75]You have TikTok hair.
[112:46.89]Uh... This kind of is what it looks like when you make a bowl of spaghetti.
[112:54.45]This is just spaghetti.
[112:55.71]This is a bowl- you're looking down at your delicious bowl of spaghetti right now.
[113:01.63]Don't you just want to go in there with a fork and like twirl it around and just... Okay, uh, I'm- I'll be right back.
[113:11.38]That literally- I almost died on camera.
[113:13.66]I'll be right back.
[115:17.14]I'm back.
[115:17.46]Alright.
[115:18.98]Let me just wipe the lens.
[115:24.49]That was just horrible.
[115:26.17]Everything about that sucked.
[115:35.66]Do the last one?
[115:36.26]I'm gonna do all of them, man.
[115:37.14]Don't worry.
[115:42.86]Genuine fear.
[115:45.44]But that's the thing.
[115:48.25]Look, if anybody screams in your face right in your eyes, you could tell me you were going to do that, and it would still fuck me up.
[115:56.24]You understand?
[115:59.44]You could seriously... You could tell me, hey, Jeremy, I just want to let you know, I'm going to scream in your face right now.
[116:10.92]And I go, okay, well, that sucks.
[116:12.30]I don't really want you to do that, but I'm ready for you.
[116:15.14]And if you went like...
[116:17.27]Like, I'd go... It doesn't matter if you know it's going to happen.
[116:21.79]It just sucks.
[116:26.43]Let me... My camera... Hold on.
[116:27.94]Wait.
[116:28.28]I'm going to put on the scary light.
[116:36.06]Remember that picture that somebody linked?
[116:49.71]Oh!
[116:49.83]Oh, it's like red!
[116:57.04]Hold on, let me fix this.
[117:04.01]You literally made it out of plastic.

[117:22.86]That looks alright.
[117:24.88]It's a little scary in here.
[117:25.98]And once the sun goes down, you know, it'll be scary.
[117:34.34]This looks like every movie that Jason Statham is in.
[117:38.51]This is just the color scheme of every one of his movies.
[117:40.73]Now I just need to have my heart explode if I go underneath 800 beats per minute or something, whatever it is.

[118:03.70]Okay, once the sun comes down, this is going to be really cool.
[118:07.42]It's going to be like a weird fucking scary room for you guys.
[118:12.92]I don't have candles.
[118:14.60]If you want me to light candles and put them around me when I could knock them fucking over and not know about it and burn this place down.

[132:16.47]Welcome back to Parts and Service.
[132:19.29]Oh no, it looks like Bonnie's guitar is out of tune and must be recalibrated.
[132:24.43]First, we must access his harmonization module located inside his secondary throat pipe.
[132:30.20]To access the throat pipe, both eyes must first be removed.
[132:34.74]You must be as precise as possible when removing the eyes from their respective sockets.
[132:39.92]First, firmly grip Bonnie's left eye and carefully remove it from its socket.
[132:44.52]Left eye.
[132:45.14]That's this one.
[132:47.52]Great job.
[132:48.58]Deposit the left eye in the cleaning receptacle on your left.
[132:51.70]Well done.
[132:52.80]Now, firmly grip Bonnie's right eye and carefully remove it from its socket.
[132:57.06]Deposit the right eye in the cleaning receptacle on your right.
[133:07.06]Excuse me?
[133:11.21]What's wrong?
[133:11.77]What happened there?
[133:12.63]Attention.
[133:14.97]Welcome back to Parts and Service.
[133:17.53]Oh At the same time?
[133:40.62]Well done.
[133:41.70]You now have access to Bonnie's harmonization module.
[133:44.88]Press the blinking button inside Bonnie's secondary throat pipe to enter calibration mode.
[133:50.46]I've played this game with the alligator and you take the teeth out and if you get it wrong, he smashes his mouth on your hand.
[133:57.39]Something is not right.
[133:59.05]One of those notes is out of tune.
[134:01.19]You may push the button again to replay the audio check.
[134:05.03]Press the colored button that corresponds to the incorrect note.
[134:08.67]What?
[134:09.11]Okay, hold on.
[134:14.91]I don't know, I don't play guitar.
[134:20.22]Three?
[134:24.64]Green.
[134:26.16]Green.
[134:32.42]Green.
[134:34.24]Yep.
[134:44.47]Great job.
[134:45.43]Bonnie is in tune and ready for his solo.
[134:48.43]Let's close him up.
[134:49.97]Simply replace both eyes in the same order that you removed them, then close up the faceplate, and we'll call it a day.
[134:56.95]Uh... Well done.
[135:09.89]That concludes your parts and services task.
[135:12.04]Cool.
[135:12.64]See you next time.
[135:17.62]Got it.
[135:20.84]Yeah, chat was wrong.
[135:21.76]You guys are wrong.
[135:22.65]Just ready for Asbear.
[135:29.47]Dude, Scott Hawthorne probably has made 500 million dollars off this.
[135:39.81]I guarantee he has a gold toilet.
[135:41.92]He's probably got like a gold house.
[135:47.70]Chico.
[135:51.66]Probably.
[135:52.14]Good for him.
[135:52.82]Laughing my ass off.
[135:55.14]See, right now he probably gets a notification when a Five Nights at Freddy's stream happens.
[135:59.49]Right now he's probably on his toilet with his gold-plated toilet paper and he's probably just going, yeah, pretty good out here.
[136:05.81]Oh, Scott.
[136:12.75]Available.
[136:16.20]I just want a piece of the gold.
[136:18.17]I only want a piece of the gold, not all of it.
[136:20.99]What'd it say?
[136:21.37]Remove the food particles.
[136:45.41]How do you have pizza stuck to your head?
[136:47.03]Food particles?
[136:53.85]It.
[136:57.11]This looks... Good job.
[137:03.07]Make sure Chica is not hiding any other treats inside her beak.
[137:07.28]To open her beak, carefully press the two buttons located on the sides of Chica's head.
[137:12.96]When can VR have, like, taste mode?
[137:18.48]It looks like Chica has picked up some unwanted friends.
[137:21.92]To clear the infestation, apply the Fazbear Entertainment Restaurant Grade Chemispray to Chica's exterior.
[137:28.73]Press the button under the hanging canister to activate the chemispray.
[137:35.06]Avoid inhaling the chemispray.
[137:37.32]Exposure to cleaning, disinfecting, and maintenance chemicals may result in respiratory problems, skin, or eye irritation.
[137:45.04]Good job.
[137:46.14]Now reattach Chica's upper arm, hand, and cupcake plate.
[137:52.20]Upper arm?
[137:55.36]I dropped it!
[137:55.80]Don't scream at me!
[138:08.84]upper arm hand and and cupcake plate well done oh no it looks like chica needs another dose of the chemi spray do not let the infestation spread be sure to give the canister button another push as needed return the cupcakes to chica's plate what what do you mean get over here
[138:37.86]Great job.
[138:38.98]Chica is ready to serve pizza and hugs to the kids again.
[138:42.92]Take a complimentary slice of pizza for a job well done.
[138:46.37]Are you serious?
[138:49.45]Why are they doing this to us?
[138:54.61]Go on.
[138:55.57]Take it.
[138:56.85]Oh, wow.
[138:57.11]This is like my favorite pizza ever.
[138:58.99]Thin crust pepperoni pizza.
[139:01.66]Delicious.
[139:04.84]See you next time.
[139:09.75]Oh, that's how much I eat, too.
[139:11.34]I eat a whole pizza.
[139:16.00]Eat a roach.
[139:20.14]Hey, speaking of cola, I've got an adult cola over here that I think I want to have a sip of.
[139:49.79]It hurt.
[139:50.71]That, like, sucked.
[139:53.64]My VR nose is huge.
[140:03.02]Okay.
[140:03.90]Don't fall.
[140:04.26]I like these.
[140:10.85]They're kind of fun.
[140:11.75]Alright.
[140:13.35]Freddy.
[140:13.77]Parts and services.
[140:14.93]I'm going to 100% this.
[140:17.23]Not the game, but this part.
[140:19.19]The Forbidden Adult Cola.
[140:24.33]Welcome back to Parts and Service.
[140:26.65]It looks like one of our guests left a personal item on our star attraction.
[140:31.74]Let's return it to the Lost and Found.
[140:35.22]Carefully, grab and remove the child's hat from Freddy's mouth.
[140:40.00]Freddy's got a pretty good hold of- Good job.
[140:43.02]Now place the hat in the Lost and Found bin on your right.
[140:48.44]While we're at it, let's make sure there isn't anything else stuck inside.
[140:54.03]To access Freddy's chest cavity, grab Freddy's bowtie and pull it outwards.
[141:00.69]Well done.
[141:01.81]Freddy's chest cavity is now open.
[141:04.54]Remove the child's watch and place it in the lost and found bin.
[141:08.46]Be careful not to touch any of Freddy's sensitive wiring.
[141:20.26]Oh, champ.
[141:20.66]Let's see it.
[141:22.14]No, I want to see pumpkins.
[141:23.40]I want to see Jerma pumpkins.
[141:25.18]I want to see the pumpkins.
[141:26.99]For one day only, the sun is a pumpkin.
[141:31.19]I want to see Jerma pumpkin.
[141:34.67]Good job.
[141:35.77]It appears there is a child's shoe wedged behind Freddy's music box.
[141:40.15]The music box must be removed before you can access the child's shoe.
[141:44.03]How do I get that?
[141:44.71]Gently grasp the music box and extract it from Freddy's chest cavity before the safety latch descends.
[141:51.14]What's this music box?
[141:53.20]I don't know what that is.
[141:55.14]I don't know what a music box... Is this it, right?
[141:56.52]Is that the music box?
[141:59.52]Is this it?
[141:59.92]Carefully place the music box on the work table to your left.
[142:04.42]Great job.
[142:05.56]To reset the safety latch, press the button located on Freddy's endoskeleton.
[142:11.98]Now, remove the child's shoe and place it in the lost and found bin.
[142:18.11]Don't fuck with me here.
[142:19.11]Don't fuck with me.
[142:20.73]Don't fuck with me.
[142:24.77]Can I see some fucking Jerva pumpkins, please?
[142:28.51]Well done.
[142:29.63]Return the music box to Freddy's chest cavity and we'll call it a day.
[142:35.58]Oh no!
[142:36.63]You seem to have mishandled Freddy's music box.
[142:39.57]This is not good.
[142:41.41]A replacement may be found on the work table.
[142:44.97]A slow and even pace is recommended.
[142:55.96]Crisis averted.
[142:57.56]To close Freddy's chest cavity, press the large black button on the center of Freddy's face.
[143:04.19]That concludes your time in parts and service.
[143:06.37]Your pay will be docked accordingly.
[143:10.76]Oh, what?
[143:19.78]Oh, you know what I want?
[143:20.64]Hey.
[143:24.54]Oh, why did you, what was that for?
[143:25.86]Why'd you do that?
[143:29.63]Hey, you know what's cool for Halloween if you want to watch?
[143:33.21]Have you guys ever seen Operator?
[143:36.47]It's like a claymation stop-motion horror short.
[143:39.69]It's awesome.
[143:42.43]Ever seen Operator?
[143:44.74]Okay, do yourself a favor.
[143:46.74]Halloween tonight.
[143:48.24]Go watch this two of them.
[143:49.82]Go watch Operator and then Operator 2.
[143:52.74]It's terrifying.
[143:56.65]It's about this... I'm not going to give away.
[143:59.09]Just watch.
[143:59.43]It's crazy.
[144:00.55]It's fucking horrifying.
[144:06.82]Make sure it's the claymation one.
[144:08.60]There's a couple other things that are called operator.
[144:12.10]You'll know it if it's a claymation.
[144:16.94]Yeah, somebody link it.
[144:18.38]It's like six minutes long.
[144:20.02]It's not long.
[144:22.19]If you've got like seven hours to watch this stream, you've got like seven minutes to watch Operator.
[144:35.44]Watch it on stream.
[144:36.26]No, no.
[144:37.94]They're making a third one, and I want to watch it.
[144:39.98]So give them the views.
[144:47.51]Okay.
[145:06.15]Oh no.
[145:06.53]It looks like Foxy's proprietary servo motors are malfunctioning.
[145:11.09]It is recommended that you keep an eye on Foxy at all times.
[145:14.89]You will need to place new control fuses in the exposed receptacles to continue.
[145:19.68]Retrieve the fuse from drawer number one that matches Foxy's leg receptacle.
[145:24.06]To avoid bodily harm, wait for Foxy's legs to stop moving before inserting the control fuse.
[145:29.92]Okay, it's red.
[145:30.94]Red.
[145:32.43]Red.
[145:38.23]Don't move.
[145:38.49]Okay.
[145:39.30]I've got an eye on him.
[145:42.26]I can see him.
[145:42.78]Oh, shit.
[145:43.08]I can't get in there.
[146:06.45]I can't get in.
[146:07.00]I can't get in there.
[146:07.78]Dude, he's... Ow.
[146:14.20]I'm looking at him.
[146:14.66]I'm looking at him.
[146:26.17]Got it.
[146:26.51]Four and four.
[146:27.29]Two.
[146:42.96]That's two... Two and... Two and four.
[146:52.95]I'm... Okay.
[146:55.79]Red, red, green, red, red.
[147:05.09]Red, red, green, red, red.
[147:11.66]Don't hit me.
[147:17.96]Let's draw two.
[147:26.75]Let's draw two.
[147:34.46]Green, green, green, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[147:40.00]Let's draw two.
[147:42.91]Let's draw two.
[147:49.21]Green, green, green, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[147:51.97]Green, green, green, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[147:53.85]Green, green, green, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[147:59.35]Don't bite me, you motherfucker.
[148:00.63]I don't... I'm sorry, Foxy, but...
[148:21.44]I've gotta reach under there.
[148:23.62]Fuck's sake.
[148:24.20]Alright, I got him.
[148:36.27]Good job.
[148:37.31]Retrieve Foxy's eye from drawer number three.
[148:40.35]When Foxy's eye patch is fully open, place the eye back into his eye socket.
[148:45.37]What color is the eye socket?
[149:00.40]No, don't run!
[149:03.60]No, you stupid video game!
[149:05.68]You dumb video game!
[149:07.47]Dumb video game!
[149:08.49]Dumb video game!

[149:20.65]Welcome back to Parts and Service.
[149:23.17]Oh no.
[149:24.08]It looks like Foxy's proprietary server... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[149:28.16]Pull it out.
[149:28.78]Rip it out of his fucking chest.
[149:30.37]No, I need that.

[149:31.47]That's his...
[149:55.56]Welcome back to Parts and Service.
[149:57.88]Foxy had... Oh no.
[149:59.50]It looks like Foxy's proprietary servo motors are malfunctioning.
[150:03.51]What?
[150:03.63]Oh.
[150:32.11]Good job.
[150:33.09]Foxy has regained control of his legs.
[150:35.87]A gentle reminder, it is recommended that you keep an eye on Foxy at all times.
[150:41.92]Oh no.
[150:42.86]It looks like a former employee attempted to repair Foxy's chest motor using an incorrect fuse.
[150:49.24]Carefully, remove the incorrect fuse from Foxy's chest and insert it into Foxy's upper arm receptacle.
[150:57.17]Good.
[150:57.43]Blue blue blue.

[155:22.66]Hey, you know what?
[155:26.80]I actually have something to say.
[155:30.88]Didn't it kind of seem like yesterday that this stream was seeing like 5, 6, 7k on every stream?
[155:38.91]I took like three months off, and I came back, and this is like 8,000 to 12,000 people hear a stream.
[155:46.59]That's fucking insane.
[155:48.91]When did that happen?
[155:51.61]When the fuck did that happen?
[156:01.74]2ndJerma.
[156:02.60]You need to break 20k.
[156:07.46]No.
[156:10.10]I mean, this channel has seen a lot of support from other channels.
[156:14.64]I mean, obviously, like, Vinesauce, like Vinny, Joel, those guys have been huge, just huge supporters of the stream, which is unbelievable.
[156:20.60]I can't even think.
[156:21.12]But, like, Ludwig, too.
[156:23.20]Ludwig has been, you know, he's sent you guys here a bunch of times, if you're from Ludwig.
[156:27.68]We've seen a lot of support from other streamers, which I can't even fucking fathom.

[156:54.47]A lot of people have just kind of been exposed to me over the last, like, 12 months.
[156:59.96]So, I hope you like it.
[157:03.36]And if you don't, you know you can nevermind.
[157:07.08]Welcome to Vet Repair.
[157:09.27]Fazbear Entertainment prides itself on having the most comfortable facilities.
[157:13.67]Each facility is set up at 72 degrees all the time.
[157:17.83]The four active indicator lights mean we have a well-functioning ventilation system.
[157:23.70]Your headlamp should protect you from any critters who may have stumbled into the ducts.
[157:28.52]As a certified vent technician, you should need no instruction.
[157:32.63]I'm gonna hate this one.
[157:33.15]However, in case of an emergency, it is important to remember that as the vent technician, you should never, under any circumstances, attempt to- Okay, cool.
[157:42.37]Great.

[173:03.34]How much, how much money do I have?
[173:16.14]Uh... What does that do?
[173:19.15]That's two dollars!
[173:23.83]What's this?
[173:24.21]This is unlockable.

[173:37.27]Alright, well this is hard mode for- Welcome back to Parts and Service.
[173:41.97]Oh no, it looks like Bonnie's guitar is out of tune and must be recalibrated.
[173:47.13]First, we must access his harmonization module located inside his secondary throat pipe.
[173:52.92]To access the throat pipe, both eyes must first be removed.
[173:57.45]You must be as precise as possible when removing the eyes from their respective sockets.
[174:02.59]First, firmly grip Bonnie's left eye and carefully remove it from its socket.
[174:07.43]Great job.
[174:08.50]Deposit the left eye in the cleaning receptacle on your left.
[174:11.68]Well done.
[174:12.78]Now deposit the right eye.
[174:14.54]Good job.
[174:15.74]To open Bonnie's faceplate, carefully press.
[174:18.38]Well done.
[174:19.48]You now have access.
[174:20.42]Something is not right.
[174:22.11]One of those notes is out of tune.
[174:24.25]You may push the button again to replay the audio check.
[174:28.05]Press the colored button that corresponds to the... Press the blinking button again to verify your work.
[174:33.23]Great job.
[174:34.21]Bonnie is in tune and ready for his solo.
[174:37.20]Let's close him up.
[174:38.74]Simply replace both eyes in the same order that you removed them, then close up the faceplate and we'll call it a day.
[174:49.68]Alright, I'm done.
[174:52.04]Alright, we're moving on.
[174:56.01]This was fun.
[175:00.43]I enjoyed this one.
[175:01.15]This was good.
[175:01.59]It's just too much.
[175:06.65]Some of these are too much for me, though.
[175:10.89]Halloween one?
[175:14.98]Where is it?
[175:24.21]What games next?
[175:26.31]You have a couple of choices here.
[175:28.33]Hospitality VR, which is you sit in a room and things scream in your face.
[175:32.32]Or the Walking Dead VR.
[175:35.60]Halloween DLC.
[175:36.76]Oh, I didn't buy that.
[175:42.08]Walking Dead, Hospital, Hospitality, Hospital, Hospital, Hospital.
[175:46.50]Here, Hospitality is like 10 minutes.
[175:47.90]We're going to play that first.
[175:52.88]I'm gonna play Hospitality VR.
[176:06.50]Uh, where is it?
[176:09.08]Hospitality, this is a 10 minute game.
[176:18.51]What about Saw 2?
[176:21.67]Don't control hospitality.
[176:23.99]Oh.
[176:27.25]Whatever.
[176:27.51]Is it even going to load?
[176:36.62]It might not even load.
[176:46.86]Oh, no loading.
[176:47.92]You're not going to do it?
[176:48.46]Go for it.
[176:53.52]I want to do it.
[176:57.10]We're playing Walking Dead.
[176:58.14]Hospitality VR does not want to load.
[177:03.00]Maybe the headset has to be on?
[177:05.59]I don't think so.
[177:06.31]It's loading.
[177:14.03]No?
[177:17.13]It doesn't want to do it?
[177:18.27]Try this.
[177:25.13]Reload it.
[177:26.01]Recenter your view.
[177:26.79]Okay.
[177:27.25]We're going back to home.
[177:28.17]See if I can get it through home.
[177:37.62]I have Boneworks.

[185:09.14]Hey, don't make me late.
[185:21.72]There's always somebody that, in these rides, or in these experiences, that does this.
[185:26.47]And, like, fucking don't be this person.

[186:01.88]They can't touch you.
[186:02.74]Otherwise, they get arrested.
[186:06.58]All they can do is yell at you.
[186:07.76]If they touch you, they go to jail.
[186:09.72]I know.
[186:10.02]I read that online on Snopes.
[186:30.34]Remember, it's in your room.

[187:02.78]I know.
[187:03.54]We all rode the same ride.
[187:04.86]We know it was good.
[187:07.52]Or you hear... It's like, well, that's a good thing.
[187:11.81]I don't want to clean that up.
[187:12.69]I think he's going to get up.
[187:20.77]Oh, shit.
[187:26.46]Why do I feel like this is a Watch Dogs character?
[187:30.05]Not anymore, it's huge.
[187:31.65]Not anymore, it's huge.
[187:32.81]They can't touch you though.

[187:59.50]What is that?
[188:01.70]I hear sounds.
[188:02.30]I don't like it.
[188:05.91]Watchdogs.
[188:10.11]Our most ambitious title yet!
[188:13.45]Just put as many collectibles on the mini-map as possible so we can say that.
[188:21.70]Our most ambitious title!
[188:24.63]What's going on in, like, the last three or four years where every fucking single video game has to be the most ambitious title ever?
[188:31.59]No, just make a fucking good... We played Mario, and, like, Mario chased a monkey up a staircase.
[188:37.67]And we loved it.
[188:39.39]I don't care about all your collectibles.
[188:41.69]You don't need, like, a 5,000 kilometer map with, like, 10 million collectibles and, like, $30,000 worth of in-game currency shit, which, by the way, what the fuck's up with that if it's a $60 game?
[188:55.11]And what's up with you?
[188:56.60]I've got more to say.
[188:57.72]I've got more to say.
[188:58.40]You got something to say to me?
[188:59.88]Trying to silence me?
[189:00.72]Our most, oh, the most ambitious game ever.
[189:11.55]What if I happen to make a good game?
[189:14.57]Why can't you just say a good game that we made?
[189:17.11]This person's doing this on the ride.
[189:26.39]It's like, dude, alright, man, we get it.
[189:28.27]Can we enjoy the scary ride?
[189:29.79]Now, and another thing, Ubisoft is just, it's going out of control.

[189:58.45]That was pretty cool.
[190:09.82]Well, that was cool.
[190:11.14]That was cool.
[190:11.92]I liked it.
[190:13.30]I liked it because we got to ride a ride together.
[190:14.98]No, it wasn't.
[190:15.56]It was good.
[190:26.97]Hold on, I'm trying to... How do I spell this?

[199:50.25]Press and hold the HMD reset button to reset your current playstyle.
[199:53.09]Before entering the world of The Walking Dead, you need to learn the gameplay.
[200:02.27]Oh, that's my... Get that off.
[200:06.73]Reach down to your left hip and grab the small weapon on the holster.
[200:13.66]A real ship.
[200:16.70]Turn it and let go.
[200:17.52]Good.
[200:20.62]Reach down to your right hip and grab the small weapon in the holster.
[200:22.82]Go up to the holster and let go.
[200:29.14]This is good.
[200:29.92]This feels pretty good.
[200:43.39]Reach to your right shoulder and grab the big weapon.
[200:50.82]Okay, I like this.
[200:52.64]Let it go.
[200:53.34]Reach over your left shoulder and pull out the backpack.
[200:56.97]Let go of the backpack and it will automatically return to the same shoulder.
[201:01.85]Take food from your backpack and hold it to your mouth to eat to restore stamina.
[201:09.61]Nutria stew.
[201:16.46]Okay.
[201:17.34]Take bandages and wrap it around your arm.
[201:27.34]This audio is freaking me out.
[201:32.38]Pull out your journal.
[201:36.94]That's not a journal.
[201:38.54]Reach over your right side and grab your journal.
[201:44.01]Ah!
[201:45.05]Ah!
[201:45.61]Do you hear?
[201:45.95]I'm in the game.
[201:47.15]Ah!
[201:49.21]This is fucked up.
[201:53.83]Do you hear me?
[201:58.71]Hello!
[201:59.01]Hey, everybody!
[202:01.63]You hear that, right?
[202:02.35]There's an echo.
[202:08.05]Hey, everybody!
[202:10.30]How are you?
[202:11.40]My name's Jerma!
[202:12.82]See?
[202:17.36]No, you can hear me in the game!
[202:19.06]The journal tracks your tasks.
[202:28.44]It's a map and provides helpful info.
[202:31.88]I can hear myself fucking talking.
[202:42.90]Angle button?
[202:45.85]It's a square button.
[203:00.19]Okay, let's go.
[203:10.40]I got the shiv on the chair.

[204:11.84]Alright.
[204:22.60]Got one.
[204:23.60]They like combat and running can use stamina.
[204:33.23]Running out of stamina will make combat difficult.
[204:42.77]I just hit myself in the mouth.
[204:47.10]Thank you.
[204:50.28]Murder.
[204:54.09]Get away from me.

[205:02.78]Get off me!
[205:10.92]Fun.
[205:11.21]I don't need to learn how to do that.
[205:15.21]I already know how to do that.
[205:22.85]Use the trigger and interact with your offhand to eject the magazine.
[205:29.03]Have a magazine from your ammo pouch.
[205:31.30]Talk to the person by the exit.
[205:55.44]I'm sorry.
[206:04.23]I killed two NPCs already.
[206:09.74]Stop.
[206:11.28]The tourist.
[206:13.14]In the flesh.
[206:16.26]Stories about you been buzzing all over the bayou.
[206:20.34]Where does he even reach Nola?
[206:22.52]There's money in here.
[206:25.22]But if the city's where you're headed, well, I suspect your story is just beginning.
[206:33.20]Allie about it.
[206:35.12]New Orleans city limits today.
[206:40.85]One lone soul to another.
[206:43.79]The dead ain't the only thing to be fearing in the Big Easy.
[206:56.91]Help is on the way!
[206:58.63]There is a war brewing.
[207:01.09]The tower on one side, looming on the horizon, high and mighty, spouting their all-for-one ideals and shunning any folks who don't be toeing the line.
[207:21.31]Hey!
[207:22.23]Don't kill that guy.
[207:23.63]Don't shoot that guy.
[207:24.98]You shot that guy.
[207:27.08]And by the way, fuck off!
[207:29.38]Those reclaimed renegades are on the other, making everyone's skin crawl with their horror show tactics.
[207:40.09]And the powder keg that's going to make the whole city blow?
[207:44.49]The Reserve.
[207:46.89]I can tell by the spark that jumped up in your eyes that you've heard the legends.
[207:52.61]The reserve is real.
[207:53.95]What happened to my right arm?
[208:17.04]All that grub.
[208:19.23]All those meds.
[208:22.23]Military equipment.
[208:24.81]An ammo to boot.
[208:27.23]Untouched.
[208:29.08]Hidden.
[208:35.10]And guess who's close to unearthing the mother load?
[208:39.07]That's right.
[208:40.39]You're looking at him.
[208:42.93]Snipe.
[208:43.72]But this broken body has seen better days.
[208:47.60]And I need to get after it real quick before the fools get wise.
[208:52.00]Sure.
[208:52.74]So, if you find yourself itching to step out of the bayou and help out an old man, well, you can find me in the cemetery where I'm holed up.
[209:05.47]There would be a 50-50 split in the future.
[209:09.00]I'm in I ain't greedy and I ain't no fool I'm in give it a ponder tourist you just might be what this sinking city needs to keep his head above water but then again
[209:33.76]Maybe you're the type to pour the whole godforsaken place under.
[209:39.87]What's that?
[209:40.19]What?
[209:40.89]Get out of here.
[209:46.23]This is my boat.
[209:48.41]This is my boat.
[210:00.06]What's that, a loser?
[210:04.40]Sky Dance Interactive presents The Walking Dead.
[210:12.70]The only Walking Dead game since 2010 that was worth playing.
[210:29.11]Fuck it, I'm going for it.
[210:48.10]I like that notes and drawings are stored in your journal, okay.
[210:49.80]Your journal's here, right?

[211:07.12]Okay.
[211:09.20]Alright, let's go.
[211:17.98]Graveyard.
[211:19.10]Strut.
[211:22.95]An old man named Henry lives in this graveyard.
[211:25.93]He told me to meet him here.
[211:28.21]If I help him find the reserve, he'll split the supplies with me, find the old man's hideout.
[211:35.29]So, let's find him.
[211:48.78]You punch?
[211:53.41]How do... I don't... Press down on the right trackpad to crouch.
[211:59.69]Knife.

[212:09.12]Oh, yeah.
[212:09.60]Thank you.

[212:16.49]I don't know what that is.
[212:34.45]Grab the top of a flat surface and push down.

[249:35.21]What did you just say?
[249:38.24]I said... I said waterfall.
[249:45.42]That's not possible.
[249:47.50]Who is this?
[249:49.75]The Joker.
[249:53.05]Just someone who enjoys waterfalls.
[249:56.23]Who is this?
[249:58.73]Big fan of all varieties.
[250:00.83]You're making me funny.
[250:03.16]I'm not laughing.
[250:04.48]Are you alone?
[250:08.33]why does that matter I'm asking the questions are you alone do not lie I will find out and then this conversation's over hey I am someone else is here weird little guy staring me down doesn't blink at all and he's got this twisted grin plastered on his filthy face tell me what he looks like
[250:34.52]I put the mic down.
[251:04.65]Alright, come meet me at the graveyard.
[251:07.91]Uh, I... Oh, I didn't want to skip.
[251:09.65]Who am I?
[251:29.63]I came across a journal.
[251:31.61]Belonged to a soldier.
[251:33.67]This frequency, waterfall, gnarly.
[251:38.37]Does anyone else know about it?
[251:43.15]Yes.
[251:43.55]An old timer named Henri.
[251:45.89]But he's dead.
[251:47.79]No clue about anyone else.
[251:49.75]Fuck.
[251:50.77]Okay.
[251:51.45]Shit.
[251:52.15]Sorry.
[251:53.75]Okay.
[251:54.93]I got what I need for now.
[251:56.52]I know you're telling the truth.
[251:58.66]And you tell me who you are.
[251:59.66]I get it.
[251:59.96]Okay.
[252:00.08]Come to the reserve.
[252:01.20]I've heard of it.
[252:21.94]What else do you know?
[252:22.68]Everyone's heard of it.
[252:24.02]You'd have to live in a hole in the ground not to.
[252:27.46]I'm interested in more than that.
[252:30.02]Yeah, well, how would I know more than anyone else?
[252:34.20]You mentioned your ears were everywhere.
[252:36.62]You heard of me before I even set foot in Noldor.
[252:39.98]Seems like someone so informed would know a bit more than the average schmuck when it comes to the thing everyone is talking about, right?
[252:49.28]Not necessarily.
[252:56.33]Not too friendly, are we?
[252:58.81]Alright, I'll drop it for now.
[253:05.71]You know what to call me, but I don't know what to call you.
[253:09.91]You got a name?
[253:10.68]I'm not telling you my name, okay?
[253:12.78]So don't ask anymore.
[253:16.83]How many subs if he shoots himself tonight?
[253:19.88]I wouldn't say that.
[253:21.10]How many subs if he shoots himself?
[253:35.05]I came to Nola to meet up with an old-timer named Henri, speaking to you through his radio.
[253:41.56]He wound up dead, along with a bunch of other folks.
[253:45.74]I don't know anything about a dead old man.
[253:52.46]The old man had a name, and it was Henri.
[253:56.20]And it seems like Henri was trying to track you down.
[253:59.74]There must have been a reason, right?
[254:02.39]I'm telling you, I don't know anything about what's going on up there.
[254:06.01]There's no reason to track me down.
[254:07.35]We're going in a circle.
[254:08.67]We're going in a complete circle.
[254:12.44]Henri was on to something.
[254:13.82]That was clear.
[254:15.08]And it must have been clear to the fuckers that killed him, too.
[254:18.08]So I've been straight with you.
[254:19.50]Why not be straight with me?
[254:21.50]Maybe we can help each other.
[254:23.47]Cut the bullshit and...
[254:26.60]I'm telling you, I don't know anything about what's going on up there.
[254:30.21]There's no reason to track me down.
[254:31.51]Yes, you do.
[254:32.21]Up there?
[254:34.13]What do you mean up there?
[254:35.23]What are you talking about up there?
[254:36.47]If you're not up here with the rest of us, where are you?
[254:40.01]That's classified.
[254:42.47]You don't have clearance.
[254:43.91]In fact, I don't even know what I'm talking to you right now.
[254:46.09]Pet the dog.
[254:46.67]Pet the dog.
[254:47.29]What the fuck was that?
[254:51.15]They coming for you?
[254:53.14]Shit.
[254:56.45]There's something going on over here.
[254:58.47]Hold on just a minute.
[254:59.91]Fuck, shit.
[255:00.93]No, I should never have... No, no.
[255:03.43]Fuck off.
[255:05.25]Wait, do you need... What the fuck was that?
[255:08.26]They coming for you?
[255:10.24]Shit.
[255:12.52]It's windy here.
[255:13.78]I don't know.
[255:14.90]Probably nothing.
[255:16.24]Hold on.
[255:17.12]You bullshit.
[255:17.92]You know what?
[255:18.67]Fuck you and your line.
[255:20.03]I'm done with this.
[255:24.94]Best to get the strange sound.
[255:26.18]That was not fun.
[255:35.49]What is ammo?
[255:42.65]Sun powder.
[255:43.99]Antiseptic.
[255:45.71]What is ammo?
[255:49.76]A weapon or something.
[255:52.66]I make ammo?
[256:00.30]Let's go say hi.
[256:10.96]What was that?
[256:11.58]Might have been the old man.
[256:23.07]A picture of... a bridge.
[256:37.28]weapon.
[256:38.15]I have to use this for weapons.
[256:48.45]Horned.
[256:53.44]Oh, shoot.
[256:55.30]I don't think I can kill these things.
[256:58.80]Oh.
[257:25.37]Oh, shit.
[257:35.76]Aliens are gonna be right around the corner, guaranteed.
[257:37.72]Yep.
[257:38.10]Come on!
[258:04.89]Help!
[258:05.71]Help!
[258:06.93]Help!
[258:07.71]Help!
[258:09.09]Help me!
[258:14.36]I have to stop.
[258:20.02]It's getting to be too much.
[258:34.50]Like right here and right in here.
[258:37.94]The game's boring anyways.
[258:43.49]Thanks for streaming.
[258:45.49]I wanted to go for at least another 40 minutes.
[258:49.39]He's going to bring out Bugleberry.
[258:51.27]I'm not.
[258:51.83]Bugleberry's not going to show up until probably Thanksgiving.
[258:57.57]Check the link?
[259:27.85]Well, thanks for watching, everybody.
[259:29.79]I'm sorry we're cutting it like half an hour short, but I just can't.
[259:34.63]Even if I was sitting down, it's just the weight of the device on my head.
[259:37.79]For those of you that don't know, I have costochondritis.
[259:42.18]And sometimes... Eh, it's a new thing.
[259:43.58]It's annoying.
[259:45.42]What?
[259:46.88]Oh, no.
[259:47.18]I look fucking terrifying.
[259:49.44]Happy Halloween, though.
[259:50.88]Five Nights at Freddy's was good.
[259:52.90]Hospitality Disney ride was fun.
[259:55.57]It was two bucks.
[259:56.37]Don't even worry about it.
[259:58.93]What else did we play?
[259:59.53]We played three other games.
[260:01.89]That first game killed me.
[260:04.01]That mansion game was insanely terrifying.
[260:07.73]The mansion.
[260:08.33]Affected the mansion.
[260:13.57]That murdered me in the first 40 minutes of the stream.
[260:16.25]Thanks a lot.
[260:21.96]A shitload of subs came in, too.
[260:23.50]A ton of people have subbed.
[260:25.64]On top of the people that have already subbed.
[260:29.40]Have a safe rest of your Halloween, everybody.
[260:34.16]Happy Halloween.
[260:35.84]We'll see you in a few days.
[260:36.90]I'll see you on... Let's see.
[260:38.16]Wait.
[260:38.40]Let's... Alright.
[260:39.42]This, like... I don't like this.
[260:40.52]Let's take the scary cam off.
[260:43.88]It's even worse.
[260:48.74]That's fine.
[260:55.43]We'll see you guys on... Here are the subs, by the way.
[261:00.75]What's today?
[261:01.43]Today is... I'll probably see you guys on the 4th.
[261:05.51]Wednesday the 4th or Thursday the 5th.
[261:07.81]Probably Wednesday the 4th.
[261:08.71]So, check the sus tomorrow or the next day if you want an actual accurate answer.
[261:18.81]We'll do a raid.
[261:19.27]Yeah, we'll raid somebody.
[261:19.93]Who are we going to raid?
[261:22.15]I'm seeing a lot of names here, but let me see who's currently live.
[261:27.26]Who's live right now?
[261:32.74]We have not raided Joel in a long time.
[261:36.62]And he's doing Halloween shit too, so.
[261:40.76]Go enjoy the rest of your Halloween spooky night.
[261:45.27]With Varg Skeletor.
[261:48.73]With Joel.
[261:54.98]I'll see you guys in a few days.
[261:56.14]Happy Halloween.
[262:03.07]I had fun.
[262:04.85]Just my body hates itself.
[262:16.06]It was a shitload of people here.
[262:17.08]There's a shitload of people here every time now.
[262:19.28]And I don't even know what to say.
[262:24.82]I hope you think it's interesting.
[262:26.04]I hope you're having fun here.
[262:33.75]Go say, here's what I want you to say.
[262:35.39]When you go to Joel, say, Happy Halloween.
[262:39.43]Joel?
[262:40.57]That's really easy.
[262:41.42]No, say, Boo.
[262:44.02]B-O-O.
[262:45.86]Exclamation point.
[262:48.54]Happy Halloween, Joel!
[262:51.08]Wow, really interesting thing to say in a raid.
[262:54.32]Just say Boo with two O's and an exclamation point.
[262:58.93]Then behave.
[263:02.18]Thanks for the subs, though.
[263:02.90]Seriously, there was a lot tonight.
[263:08.36]I'll see you guys on Pro Wednesday.
[263:16.81]Last night you said you wouldn't be doing this in five years.
[263:19.05]Are you going to quit?
[263:21.03]Oh, I never take anything I say seriously unless I'm directly looking into your eyes in the camera.
[263:30.06]Alright, goodnight guys.
[263:31.48]Go raid Joel.
[263:32.44]Happy Halloween.
[263:33.60]See you in a few days.
[264:03.15]Can somebody link me the clip of when I broke my arm on my shelf?
[264:06.97]I just kind of want to see it.
[264:09.93]In my own time.
[264:10.59]I'll see you later.
[264:54.41]you
[265:29.03]you
