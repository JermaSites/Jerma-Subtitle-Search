[00:10.60]Hello everybody, this is Lefter1 and we are here with some more of Jerma.
[00:14.72]Just hopping around.
[00:16.74]Like a fool.
[00:18.49]Hippa hoppe, hippe hoppe.
[00:19.83]Alright, so apparently we need to check out the message board for some more missions because people got mad at us for not doing them.
[00:28.25]But I guess... Did we turn them in or what?
[00:31.54]I can't remember.
[00:34.30]I think from last time.
[00:36.00]Check.
[00:36.68]Check your log and see.
[00:39.18]I just need to move my sensitivity down one more.
[00:41.28]There we go.
[00:42.56]Like that.
[00:43.06]Alright.
[00:44.74]And apparently I have a skill point that I can use.
[00:48.38]And I have been skilling like an idiot the whole time, so... Let's see.
[00:55.65]I got most of my points in... Pretty much all my points are in the left tree.
[01:02.15]Nice.
[01:04.76]Well, apparently the last one, every bullet I shoot will daze enemies, which is pretty cool.
[01:10.88]Pretty cool.
[01:12.12]That's pretty awesome.
[01:13.32]So, I'm wondering whether to go with another regeneration of health, so regenerate 6% of health per second instead of 4, or have a 20% chance of dazing enemies when I leave the blast thing.
[01:28.78]Hmm...
[01:30.64]I'll go with the 20% chance thing.
[01:34.06]That would be good.
[01:36.31]And then at least it gives me that ability.
[01:39.19]Temporarily.
[01:40.97]And people told me that I should go max out all my DSDUs and my SMG ammo and stuff so we don't encounter all that crap again.
[01:51.14]Yeah, I think I have all the SDUs I can get right now maxed out.
[01:54.54]Pretty sure, yeah.
[01:57.96]Need some ammo though.
[02:00.03]I do not have stuff like that.
[02:04.03]What is this?
[02:04.67]Let me sell some of my items.
[02:11.96]Oh, I'm supposed to use my artifact.
[02:13.52]People have been yelling at me for that too.
[02:16.38]Yeah, and also keep in mind guys that we've only been playing the game for a few hours now.
[02:22.48]Just because there's like 20 episodes doesn't mean we've been playing for like 20 hours.
[02:26.18]Yeah.
[02:28.66]So if you guys think we're noobs, we kind of still are.
[02:31.84]Because each episode is about 15 minutes, and there's been, what, 15, 16 of them?
[02:39.30]17?
[02:39.50]Yep.
[02:40.30]So it's about three or four hours, and we play pretty much maybe once every week or so.
[02:45.99]We don't play this game all the time, so give us a little bit of slack, guys.
[02:51.99]Why am I using a level 3 desert SMG?
[02:54.65]Let me sell that bad boy.
[02:59.44]I need something that's closer to my level.
[03:03.70]That's what I need.
[03:06.44]How do you tell the level of your weapon?
[03:08.66]It says level requirement at the top of the weapon card, so to speak.
[03:13.84]This one's 12,000.
[03:16.85]Wow.
[03:19.05]This level requirement.
[03:20.51]I need a new sniper rifle then, apparently.
[03:22.89]Yeah.
[03:25.22]It's got good damage though, and I haven't seen anything on the ground that has more damage and that's better.
[03:30.90]At least yet.
[03:31.75]I don't know.
[03:34.05]Let me put on that machine pistol.
[03:36.31]That thing saved me more times than I care to admit.
[03:41.11]But how is it better than this one?
[03:45.80]Let's see.
[03:47.30]The incendiary repeater.
[03:51.90]So apparently...
[03:54.92]What I should be using is more damage.
[03:57.90]That's what people have been telling me.
[03:59.67]More damage is preferred over anything else.
[04:05.71]Other people were saying, too, that there's elements in the game.
[04:08.93]If you're shooting a fire person with a fire gun, it's not going to do anything.
[04:12.83]And electrical beats... It's kind of like Pok√©mon, apparently.
[04:16.48]It's like electrical beats this and fire beats that.
[04:19.24]So we'll have to figure that out.
[04:21.77]yep alright I'm going to check out our quest let's see so we have a tough quest the level 15 quest let's do that one harvest shock crystals we have to harvest 50 shock crystals let's see let's actually let's get this one for you because this is for yeah we have to find some combat rifle stuff so alright sounds good let's go
[04:52.53]Whoa.
[04:53.75]That was like an explosion.
[04:56.59]I just wanted to get us a car.
[04:57.71]Sexy car.
[04:57.97]Here we go.
[05:01.25]Alright, where do we have to go on this one?
[05:09.97]You so just tried to run that guy over.
[05:11.83]Yeah.
[05:15.53]Quiet.
[05:16.53]Oh, there's a chest up there.
[05:17.49]You want to get it?
[05:18.21]Oh, oh, oh.
[05:19.60]Oh, that almost happened again.
[05:20.66]I think those are the chests that always respawn there.
[05:23.70]Oh, where are you going?
[05:24.26]Oh, really?
[05:24.88]Oh, I'll come back in.
[05:28.40]Right when you said no, I was like, getting out.
[05:34.82]It looks like you can go this way, go straight, and then you're going to take a left up here.
[05:40.25]The next left you can possibly take.
[05:42.97]One right here?
[05:44.07]Yep.
[05:44.47]It's like the hard left, yep.
[05:46.85]And then it looks like it's take a right.
[05:49.33]It's like right down here somewhere.
[05:51.17]Yeah, well, we're on a bridge, so we should maybe get off.
[05:55.09]Oh, Welp's just somehow in the car.
[05:59.67]There's a bad guy in the car?
[06:01.69]Yeah, he was just in the car.
[06:02.72]He's like right here.
[06:05.40]Nice.
[06:06.70]What is this?
[06:07.72]He's riding shotgun.
[06:10.33]Yeah.
[06:13.11]Here's one.
[06:14.47]Combat rifle stock.
[06:19.92]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[06:21.06]It's fusion.
[06:22.32]What is that?
[06:34.79]God, I love that new thing that I get.
[06:38.29]What is it?
[06:39.53]Where when I go into the phase walk thing, it uses fire.
[06:43.65]Oh, here's another one.
[06:46.64]There's a bunch of stuff in these chests down here.
[06:49.60]There's a couple lockers right here.
[06:50.78]I'm just picking up some money.
[06:55.60]There we go.
[06:55.94]I got the money that's down here.
[06:57.42]Oh, this guy's right here too.
[07:00.55]We'll test out this for Peter.
[07:02.07]Oh, got to run, got to run, got to run.
[07:08.70]Ready time to phase walk.
[07:11.12]My sexy phase walk.
[07:12.78]Bird.
[07:15.70]Oh boy.
[07:17.82]That is hot.
[07:19.75]Now that is hot.
[07:26.59]In your face!
[07:27.41]In your face!
[07:30.11]He's just you.
[07:30.83]Alright, wait, where are we getting shot at from?
[07:32.77]I think they might be down below.
[07:36.13]Sit down, buddy.
[07:36.91]There we go.
[07:39.98]Another stock rifle part.
[07:41.80]Where is this guy?
[07:42.90]There he is.
[07:45.68]Do we need to continue over here?
[07:47.25]I don't think so.
[07:52.71]At least according to the map.
[07:54.21]It says it's all in this area.
[07:56.61]Could be wrong, but you can check over there.
[07:58.43]This guy just spawned out of nowhere.
[08:01.21]There's another weapon chest here.
[08:09.71]Oh, boy.
[08:10.65]Oh, lordy.
[08:11.83]Oh, my God.
[08:13.37]Something nice?
[08:14.31]Oh, my God.
[08:15.03]This is, like, the best sniper rifle I've seen yet.
[08:17.79]270 damage.
[08:18.53]Thank you very much.
[08:19.25]I'll take you.
[08:19.89]Wow, nice.
[08:20.53]Alright.
[08:22.13]Time to stop being a scrub, I guess.
[08:23.63]Is there anything else in there?
[08:25.49]There's another sniper rifle, too.
[08:26.91]I just took it.
[08:27.39]It was kind of... Here, yeah.
[08:28.09]Take him for a selling.
[08:29.11]Definitely putting that on right now.
[08:32.08]Where is it?
[08:33.62]Oh, my hell, yeah.
[08:34.48]This thing is so much better.
[08:37.06]Goddamn.
[08:38.28]Did I use the other one?
[08:42.23]Got to be higher level to use them.
[08:45.20]That's fine.
[08:45.90]You'll get there eventually.
[08:47.84]Those are nasty.
[08:48.46]There's another one.
[08:56.04]Got the last one.
[08:57.92]I'm getting shot at.
[09:02.05]I just picked up the, uh, the last, uh, star.
[09:03.81]Oh, birds!
[09:04.65]Birds!
[09:05.23]Birds!
[09:05.73]Ow!
[09:06.01]Ow!
[09:06.63]Ow!
[09:07.21]I'll send my bird to the rescue.
[09:10.59]Yeah, we're just, like, flying around.
[09:12.27]Yeah, he's not doing anything.
[09:13.29]Nice job, bird.
[09:14.57]Oh, god.
[09:15.59]Oh, god.
[09:16.51]Here they come.
[09:19.35]Oh, god.
[09:20.29]Take cover.
[09:22.64]Get shot out of the sky.
[09:23.68]Get a shot out of the sky.
[09:26.00]Ready?
[09:26.30]Ready?
[09:26.54]Ready?
[09:26.88]Charge me.
[09:27.82]Oh.
[09:29.93]Alright, do we have all of them?
[09:32.86]Yup, I just picked up the last one.
[09:33.96]Alright, so let me set that, and all we have to do is talk to this guy now.
[09:41.44]I wouldn't advise jumping, oh god, you made it.
[09:44.57]You can do this, you can do this.
[09:46.01]Oh, what a boss.
[09:47.17]I didn't even jump.
[09:51.69]You drive, you're better at it than I am.
[09:55.66]Oh, looks like it'll go well.
[09:57.38]Alright, let's see if I can do this.
[10:01.67]Alright, so we're going back.
[10:02.93]Here, let me check the map.
[10:04.83]Alright, you just gotta make a left here.
[10:06.09]Right in there.
[10:08.67]Is that possible?
[10:09.21]I don't think it's possible.
[10:10.83]Wait, let me check.
[10:12.72]Because it looks like there's a little slit that we can go in through.
[10:16.08]Watch out though, there's some skags over there.
[10:18.06]Can we fit the car in there though?
[10:19.34]I don't think so.
[10:23.84]The genius that I am kinda just called some skags over.
[10:26.48]It's alright.
[10:28.82]XP.
[10:34.09]Yeah, here, we can fit through here.
[10:38.05]We lose our car.
[10:43.55]Is there anything we can pick up over here or no?
[10:46.77]Uh, it doesn't look like it.
[10:47.89]Skag behind you, watch it.
[10:49.65]Thank you, sir.
[10:50.29]Mm-hmm.
[10:53.36]What do we have here?
[10:54.54]We haven't been here yet.
[10:57.40]Oh, and we have another machine.
[10:58.54]A little Dr. Zed.
[11:01.88]No, what I need is some weapons.
[11:04.34]There's a really nice liquid sniper here.
[11:06.44]Level 13, though.
[11:09.85]Scoped rocket.
[11:12.53]Oh, look at this bladed revolver.
[11:14.65]I will buy that.
[11:15.23]This looks nice.
[11:16.03]I don't have enough room.
[11:17.47]Oh, fine.
[11:19.07]Just sell some.
[11:20.17]Because you have the sell thing.
[11:25.10]There we go, selling some of my weapons.
