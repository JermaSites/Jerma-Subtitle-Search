[00:08.70]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.60]Jeremiah here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight's gonna have two one-life gameplays back-to-back here.
[00:19.41]I'm in a one-life mood.
[00:20.59]I really don't know why, but the last couple of days, it's been all about the streaks, less about the full gameplays.
[00:26.64]But today, I have a very, very special guest, and it is, of course, you probably guessed it by the title, Grandpa!
[00:36.40]Because, of course, Grandpa is an MLG pro, is returning to Machinima Respawn tonight.
[00:43.27]That is right.
[00:44.01]Well, actually, let me rephrase that.
[00:45.55]There's going to be a trailer tonight for the second season of Grandpa, and it's pretty crazy.
[00:51.48]I had a lot of fun doing it, a lot of fun making it.
[00:53.94]So, 8 p.m.
[00:55.96]Eastern Standard Time tonight.
[00:57.74]I'm not sure when this video is going to go up today, but...
[01:01.21]8 p.m.
[01:01.63]Eastern Time is when the Grandpa MLG Season 2 trailer is going to be on Machinima Respawn.
[01:07.75]So check that out.
[01:08.77]Please, everybody, go support it.
[01:10.47]Like you always do, you guys are incredible.
[01:13.26]But let's break down the gameplays for a second before Grandpa makes his appearance.
[01:18.30]So the gameplay is of course going to be Scout and Sniper, using mostly the defaults, because of course my final 33% of my backpack was given away, so all I got is a bunch of strangers and a couple of untradeable hats and stuff, so I'm working my way back, let's just put it that way.
[01:35.51]So it's going to be the regular Scattergun, the Mad Milk, which apparently I still had,
[01:40.57]and the default bat.
[01:42.05]And for the sniper, gonna be default sniper rifle, the jarate, I think.
[01:46.01]Yeah, the jarate.
[01:47.11]And the sh... The shiv.
[01:49.83]The trifleman shiv.
[01:51.73]That was a nice derp moment right there.
[01:53.90]But yeah, anyways, I hope you guys enjoy those.
[01:55.44]They're gonna be in the background.
[01:56.42]But I am bringing on Grandpa right now.
[01:58.94]Yes.
[01:59.34]It's time for me to come on.
[02:00.24]Yes, you are coming on right now.
[02:01.40]Yes.
[02:01.88]So we want to talk about season two.
[02:03.93]We want to talk about some frequently asked questions to Grandpa.
[02:06.81]These are all for me, right?
[02:08.49]Yes.
[02:08.91]They're all for me.
[02:10.18]These are all for you.
[02:11.22]None of these are going to be for me.
[02:12.20]These are questions all for you.
[02:13.28]They better be.
[02:14.61]Okay, yes.
[02:15.13]I'm not gonna sit down here if they're not all for me.
[02:17.73]These questions are frequently asked, and I gotta tell you guys, to you guys for all the support you give me in my video game shit, it's very, very awesome, and let's start with the questions, Jeremy.
[02:30.74]Okay, alright, so...
[02:32.36]So question number one is, what is your favorite Team Fortress 2 class?
[02:36.92]The Heavy.
[02:38.15]It's the Heavy.
[02:38.85]There's no doubt in my mind it's the Heavy.
[02:40.95]Because you just hold the right mouse button down, and you just annihilate people.
[02:45.51]Why would you ever play as any other class?
[02:48.13]Why is it not just all Heavies versus all Heavies?
[02:51.91]I don't see a reason for anything else.
[02:53.59]I mean, why wouldn't you?
[02:54.40]You're the most powerful thing in the game.
[02:56.40]It wouldn't work.
[02:58.16]Team Fortress 2, it says it right in the title, it's...
[03:01.24]It's all balanced around the certain classes.
[03:03.08]If everyone went heavy on one team, there would be two snipers that would just have a field day.
[03:07.72]No, that wouldn't really work.
[03:09.48]Spies, too.
[03:10.16]I mean, you'd get one spy on the team, it would kill nine people.
[03:13.43]No, you're wrong, because if you have two heavies, one standing in front of you and one standing behind you, you're not going to be in the fucking sandwich.
[03:21.49]Oh, I forgot, I can't swear on your channel.
[03:23.89]No, that's okay, but keep it to a minimum.
[03:28.27]So, anyways, okay, so Heavy's your favorite classic.
[03:31.62]So the second question is, what is Grandpa's favorite video game?
[03:36.96]It can be from ten years ago or yesterday, whatever came out, I don't know.
[03:40.86]Yeah, that's an easy one.
[03:42.09]That's Call of Duty 4.
[03:43.95]Modern Warfare 4.
[03:45.35]It was called something like that.
[03:47.69]That's a good, best of best game I've ever played.
[03:49.99]It was perfect balance, perfect killstreaks.
[03:53.21]That's my favorite game.
[03:54.47]College 4 is my favorite.
[03:57.60]Do you got a second favorite?
[03:58.80]Because, I mean, mine probably goes Team Fortress, Diablo.
[04:02.64]I mean, I got a lot, so I got probably four or five favorite games.
[04:05.67]Yeah, well, it would probably be College 4 and then Leisure Suit Lowry, the first one.
[04:11.77]What?
[04:12.25]No.
[04:13.14]Yeah, that was a fun game.
[04:14.34]It was a point-and-click adventure game, but it was really screwed up.
[04:18.42]There was all kinds of adult stuff going on.
[04:21.74]That was my favorite game, I tell you.
[04:23.52]I had a lot of fun playing that.
[04:25.00]Alright, so Call of Duty 4 and Leisure Suit Larry.
[04:30.93]That makes perfect sense, apparently.
[04:33.11]So, one more question before the video is over.
[04:36.59]This question gets asked...
[04:38.73]All the time, Grandpa.
[04:39.84]This is asked the most out of any of these questions.
[04:42.34]Let's hear it.
[04:43.10]When are we going to see your face?
[04:45.80]When are we going to get a Grandpa face cam video?
[04:52.36]Oh, you want to see my face, huh?
[04:53.62]I don't know.
[04:54.80]You want to see my face?
[04:56.02]Okay.
[04:57.36]Put a date and time on it.
[04:58.84]Yeah.
[04:59.23]We are going to see Grandpa's face on December 22nd, 2012.
[05:06.07]Because if the goddamn world doesn't end, then I swear to God I'll do it.
[05:10.31]So be sure to be ready to see that December 22nd, after the world collapses.
[05:16.46]So that's a good thing to look forward to.
[05:18.70]I would probably also say that, too.
[05:21.00]So...
[05:22.44]Uh, thank you for showing up here, Grandpa.
[05:24.33]The video is over.
[05:25.53]Yes.
[05:25.77]So, guys, make sure to check... Make sure you check out my Machinima Respawn series on Saturdays at 8 p.m.
[05:33.23]Eastern Time.
[05:34.33]And that's Grandpa's MLG Pro Season 2.
[05:37.45]It's starting May 12th.
[05:39.03]So, get your ass over there and go watch the trailer.
[05:42.37]Okay, bye.
[05:43.17]All right, but...
[05:44.92]See you later.
[05:45.94]See you later.
[05:46.62]Bye, asshole.
[05:48.34]Okay.
[05:49.50]Thank you guys so much for watching.
[05:50.84]I really do appreciate it.
[05:52.28]And I will see you guys all next time.
[05:54.14]So take care, everybody.
