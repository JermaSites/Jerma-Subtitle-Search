[00:36.43]Hey, dude, I was watching the VOD.
[00:39.15]Just jump scared you.
[00:42.04]Did it flicker?
[00:42.72]Did it go flicker, flicker, flicker?
[00:45.54]You're like, what?
[00:46.28]Is something wrong with my power going out?
[00:49.37]No, it's just me.
[00:51.07]What's happening?
[00:51.51]How are you?
[00:58.01]Why does your mic sound worse?
[00:59.38]Refresh the page, man.
[01:03.43]You know how often I have to hear that, and it's like, hey, why do you sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks?
[01:06.68]It's like, just refresh your fucking goddamn page, okay?
[01:09.82]Don't take it up with me.
[01:17.05]What's up?
[01:23.14]Wow, what a good start.
[01:24.70]He's in a good mood today.
[01:29.69]I'm fine.
[01:32.01]But anyways, hi, how you doing?
[01:34.37]We've got, we're going to do two streams in a row.
[01:36.74]Saturday, Sunday here.
[01:39.56]I'm not quite ready.
[01:40.06]I'm going to get my tea.
[01:41.70]Let's get the ads out of the way.
[01:42.70]Hopefully they start now and I'll be back and we can talk about it.
[01:51.75]I've got a nice tea with ginger and it's brewing.
[02:02.11]Who streams did you must be retiring on Monday?
[02:12.00]Ginger tea it is ginger.
[02:15.96]It is ginger.
[02:17.83]And it's I think it's got black pepper in it.
[02:21.41]Cool.
[02:34.54]Do you like garlic bread?
[02:36.49]Are there very many people on Earth that don't like garlic bread?
[02:42.45]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[02:44.03]We'll get started.
[04:35.50]Alright, I'm just taking a look.
[04:37.24]It's still another 60 seconds or so.
[04:39.70]I just saw somebody said, this fucking Velveeta Cheese ad.
[04:43.47]In all capitals.
[04:44.49]I don't know if they're excited about that or if they're very unhappy about it.
[04:51.88]Is that, are you, whoa, dude, I can't wait for this?
[04:54.35]Or is this, whoa, I don't like this.
[05:01.42]Unhappy?
[05:02.32]Okay, unhappy.
[05:02.72]Unhappy.
[05:06.89]Play the horse game now.
[05:09.67]I actually was going to play the horse game.
[05:12.79]But I don't know.
[05:14.97]I thought about it.
[05:22.90]I was actually going to load up an old horse derby game from 1996.
[05:30.05]But I was like, eh.
[05:35.71]In my mind, I was like, that joke would be funny for like 15 seconds.
[05:39.94]And then I might actually want to play the derby game.
[05:46.39]People are saying it's basically Monster Rancher.
[05:48.99]It looks interesting.
[05:49.91]I've seen people play it.
[05:52.39]My first reaction was like, what the hell is going on?
[05:55.22]And then it was, wait, this is, wait, you actually, they level up and they get like powers and abilities and stuff and they have to go fast?
[06:07.03]Speaking of Monster Rancher, we're going to get that off the ground soon.
[06:13.42]I want to do that Monster Rancher 2 tournament, which means I want to play Monster Rancher 2 again.
[06:21.21]Do you remember from a month or two ago, before House Flipper, I said, oh, I want to do this Monster Rancher 2 thing.
[06:27.74]And then the House Flipper stuff kind of got in the way.
[06:31.54]But I think it's a fun idea.
[06:34.70]Should work pretty well.
[06:36.19]Tournamentary.
[06:37.01]Oh, that's right.
[06:37.49]Another tournament.
[06:38.99]Hey, guys, get ready.
[06:40.27]Remember when I told you that after getting 24 streamers to do House Flipper Invitational?
[06:44.86]I was like, I'll never do that again.
[06:47.92]Monster Venture 2.
[06:48.83]I'm here to announce a big tournament.
[06:56.48]Now, there'll be maybe eight people in this.
[07:00.46]Six to ten people total.
[07:03.51]It's just going to be friends and it just, you know, it's going to be the usual suspects.
[07:13.35]I'm not going to be 30 people in this.
[07:24.16]I missed your Monster Rancher stream since you stopped streaming it.
[07:27.56]I've gone back to it a few times.
[07:28.76]I feel like I play that game on stream every couple of years.
[07:31.94]Been like that since I started streaming.
[07:34.45]And, I mean, we're kind of due for it, aren't we?
[07:37.79]The last time I played it was 2022?
[07:38.96]2021 or something?
[07:43.16]Hey, Poke said your name is Jerry.
[07:44.51]Can you comment on this?
[07:46.47]Yeah, it is.
[07:50.33]What else is there to comment on?
[07:54.32]Alright, so let's get started.
[07:55.16]We're going to play this game.
[07:55.98]We're going to start.
[07:56.42]This is a... It's going to be like a chill night.
[07:59.79]I'm just going to go until I'm kind of done.
[08:02.35]Shouldn't get too crazy, but you know, I say that.
[08:04.17]And here we go, right?
[08:06.59]The first game in the little grab bag is Die by the Sword.
[08:12.88]This game seems very interesting.
[08:15.24]I got a little bit of a... I kind of had to get a mod for this.
[08:20.75]Like a community patch for it.
[08:21.95]Apparently it makes the game look a little better and run a little better.
[08:25.32]That's kind of cool.
[08:29.85]Let's check it out.
[08:30.45]Any bush lights tonight?
[08:31.63]No.
[08:34.41]Now, you'll know if it's going to be a bush light stream.
[08:37.84]And, okay.
[08:38.98]I may have had a few drinks last time.
[08:42.30]And let me address the butt chug incident.
[08:44.43]Let me address it.
[08:48.07]There was a term that was thrown around.
[08:49.29]It was called butt chug.
[08:52.47]And I was a little disappointed that, I mean, like I said, I only said this, I only referenced the butt chug thing maybe 20 to 40 times.
[09:01.10]And you guys just kept saying it after that.
[09:03.04]You know what I mean?
[09:03.70]Like, what the fuck?
[09:10.11]Alright, let's go.
[09:10.79]Let's just play some games and hang out.
[09:13.47]Die by the sword.
[09:14.44]Let's check it out.
[09:19.45]Can you even see anything?
[09:22.10]No.
[09:24.24]You should be able to see it.
[09:26.46]Oh.
[09:27.87]Hey, there it is.
[09:29.69]I'm going to do this tutorial.
[09:31.57]Wait, I did my buttons, but let me look at the buttons again.
[09:36.14]Control, custom, control layout.
[09:38.48]Alright.
[09:39.98]Okay.
[09:40.96]W, S, D, A. Okay, E and Q. Caps lock is crouched.
[09:45.21]Gotta remember that.
[09:45.77]That's fucked up.
[09:47.96]I should probably change that.
[09:48.80]Jump is space.
[09:51.72]Weapon up is... Yeah, this one, I think you move the mouse to swing.
[09:58.63]Weapon extend.
[09:59.23]Okay, keypad zero.
[10:00.60]I have a little keyboard.
[10:02.24]I have one of those keyboards that doesn't have the numpad, so I need to make sure I get this right.
[10:07.85]Weapon extend.
[10:08.81]I don't know what that means.
[10:10.23]I'm going to make it... What should I make it?
[10:17.66]That's a goaded keyboard?
[10:20.98]Oh, that's not what you said.
[10:22.88]Make it T?
[10:23.82]Okay.
[10:24.83]Weapon block mode.
[10:27.67]Probably... B for block?
[10:30.87]Was something else B?
[10:33.98]Sheath H, that's fine.
[10:35.24]Action is right shift.
[10:40.06]Should be... Anything on left shift?
[10:43.77]I feel like that's easier to hit.
[10:50.65]Action.
[10:51.15]I'm going to do left shift.
[10:55.84]Yeah, this is a Treyarch made this game.
[11:00.26]This predates the like 14 Call of Duty games that they made.
[11:05.67]Show compass, show limb damage.
[11:07.90]This is okay.
[11:08.60]How about like P and M. I don't know.
[11:14.45]You guys can remember this.
[11:15.27]Help me out here.
[11:16.87]Custom move controls.
[11:18.39]Insert, home, page up, page down.
[11:20.82]Alright, I think we're good.
[11:24.26]If I want to change it, I can come back.
[11:27.17]Do you guys remember that?
[11:27.89]You can remember it for me.
[11:30.07]Do it for me.
[11:32.36]Will you do that for me?
[11:34.28]Thank you.
[11:35.20]Will you do it for me?
[11:37.87]Alright, let's go.
[11:40.53]Why is my arm in the air?
[11:43.71]Okay, I think I'm ready for this.
[11:53.07]Oh shit, I'm not supposed to do that yet.
[12:05.08]you must learn to move swiftly guide yourself forward and backward while turning left and right easy you may also sidestep left and right this room and be sure to hit all four corners all this room I shall raise a wall and reveal a button alright lock in hit all the corners somebody said why is the game like 20 FPS um because the game came out in 19 like 97 alright
[12:34.73]Hey, this is with the patch.
[12:36.50]You should have seen it before that.
[12:37.96]I can smell the plastic case of this game.
[12:43.87]Alright, use the action key.
[12:49.73]Half-Life came out a year later and looks better.
[12:52.47]yeah but you can't you can't take one of the quintessential most important best video games ever made in human history since the cavemen were making fire to compare to any game the great warrior is a humble warrior crouch on your knees and move through this slow passage what was crouch see oh caps lock
[13:20.87]This game's gonna be fucked.
[13:21.93]I can't wait.
[13:22.39]I'm actually excited about this one.
[13:29.54]Cavemen weren't making video games?
[13:32.50]Uh, okay, dude.
[13:35.23]Shows the dumbness of that chatter.
[13:38.43]What do you call, I hit you on head with rock as hard as I can, and then you hit me in head with rock as hard as you can.
[13:45.22]Whoever dies is game over.
[13:47.20]Sorry, dude.
[13:47.92]You're wrong.
[13:52.86]Uh, what do I have?
[13:54.19]I missed that whole tutorial.
[13:58.15]This is gonna be so twisted.
[14:00.05]Uh, how do I press the button?
[14:04.50]Uh, I need helpers!
[14:05.42]Where are my helpers?
[14:07.34]Where are the helpers?
[14:09.56]I didn't read any of it.
[14:10.39]Somebody, I was talking shit to somebody.
[14:14.21]It looks like I hit this button with my hand?
[14:16.79]You can leap about by using jump.
[14:20.50]Try it now and a few times.
[14:22.74]Let's go.
[14:23.32]Then I will allow you to proceed.
[14:29.13]Let me out.
[14:29.73]I did it.
[14:33.61]Now jump onto the raised platform.
[14:36.97]The great warrior is agile.
[14:39.54]The button on the wall will open the door.
[14:42.66]And the plate on the floor before you will close the door again.
[14:46.10]Alright, so don't touch the plate.
[14:49.43]Uh, what?
[14:55.55]Got it.
[14:59.76]Yeah, I have the patch that makes the game run better and run at a better frame rate.
[15:03.64]This is the better frame rate, which is interesting to think about.
[15:06.84]Alright, don't touch the plate.
[15:11.73]Oh, come on, man.
[15:19.86]Reset it.
[15:23.34]Reset it.
[15:26.77]remember if you land on the plate the bars will close and you will have to start again okay it's like Tony Hawk it's just like Tony Hawk this is ollie this is not jump this is ollie great warrior is an observant warrior use scout mode to get a better look scout mode while in scout mode use the movement keys to look around
[15:55.33]Then peer more closely at things with the zoom keys.
[16:00.45]If you look up and to the right, you should see the exit.
[16:04.58]Uh, that's not working.
[16:07.60]Zoom was F and R?
[16:08.84]How come that doesn't work?
[16:11.10]Look to your left.
[16:13.06]Use climb to get up on the ledge.
[16:15.89]You may want the normal camera.
[16:21.99]Okay, I got it.
[16:25.28]Is it because you bound it to P?
[16:29.65]Dude, another climbing game.
[16:30.59]Let's go.
[16:31.11]Okay, I might have to change this because...
[16:42.59]Holding W, holding space, letting go of space, and then pressing C. That ain't gonna work for me.
[16:51.15]Actually, it's not that bad.
[16:54.03]It's fine.
[16:56.72]Oh, look!
[16:57.54]Look!
[16:58.86]Skeleton.
[16:59.40]Remember?
[16:59.74]There's a skeleton at the front entrance.
[17:04.05]Classic.
[17:04.23]Classic.
[17:05.95]Oh dear, it appears we have happened upon the remains of your predecessor.
[17:12.40]Not a great warrior.
[17:14.66]Alright, well, give me my weapon and I'm... Oh, wait, you can search bodies?
[17:18.95]Let's go.
[17:19.25]Then use action again to open the gate.
[17:21.95]What do you have?
[17:22.79]You got a key on him.
[17:30.38]Put it in.
[17:33.32]I'm going to hate this by the way.
[17:36.48]This swing the mouse around with your arm thing is going to be awful.
[17:41.39]Do not fall in.
[17:42.61]Don't fall in.
[17:50.76]Do not stand on the lava.
[17:52.88]Your armor will protect you, but not for long.
[17:59.83]Oh shit, I'm alright.
[18:07.10]Let's go.
[18:07.66]How do I use it?
[18:12.62]No, that's not what it is.
[18:28.36]In arcade mode, you can slash down, slash across, and slash high.
[18:34.67]There is also VSIM mode, where you have full freedom to move the sword in any direction.
[18:41.77]You may even use the mouse or joystick for total control of your sword.
[18:47.86]Try to remove the head from the left dummy and the feet from the right dummy before moving on.
[19:09.49]This is fucking impossible, guys.
[19:12.67]I gotta change to the regular mode, I think.
[19:27.05]I'm taking off everything besides his head.
[19:37.86]I'm going slow too.
[19:39.80]Oh my fucking god.
[19:40.88]I got his head finally.
[19:42.12]Okay.
[19:49.13]The crouch?
[19:58.32]We don't gotta be accurate.
[19:59.24]We just gotta get kills, right?
[20:01.95]There we go.
[20:02.55]Nice.
[20:04.42]Do not change it.
[20:05.38]It's essential.
[20:06.04]Please.
[20:06.92]Okay.
[20:08.28]So what do I do?
[20:12.09]What am I controlling this with?
[20:27.19]Uh, my bare feet.
[20:36.50]Yeah, I just I'm doing a ASDF JKL semi with all of my toes.
[20:48.76]It's very difficult.
[20:49.52]Actually, it's pretty crazy that I'm able to do it like this.
[20:52.27]All the fucking haters can understand what I'm doing.
[21:03.80]I can't.
[21:04.64]You have to go.
[21:05.26]Oh, I just did a jumping swing.
[21:06.53]Are you kidding me?
[21:14.12]I think this is the strategy.
[21:15.70]Is to stay down.
[21:22.06]That's it, right?
[21:25.56]Oh, nope.
[21:30.88]The first enemy is going to kill me.
[21:32.49]I'm going to die to literally the first enemy.
[21:37.78]He doesn't have any limbs.
[21:38.92]What are you talking about?
[21:39.78]His limbs are all gone.
[21:40.78]Everything is gone.
[21:41.84]The head is a limb?
[21:49.16]No, it is not.
[21:50.10]The head is a head.
[21:52.08]Alright, we're good.
[21:57.56]Ooh, yeah.
[22:02.93]Come on, dude.
[22:07.27]Get over there.
[22:20.58]Why am I holding it so stupidly?
[22:23.13]No, hold it upright.
[22:29.66]He doesn't get it.
[22:30.58]He can't do it.
[22:31.12]Okay, well, that one did... Am I ready for the game?
[22:44.35]I think I'm ready.
[22:47.58]Game crash.
[22:48.94]Premature end of file.
[22:51.10]What the fuck?
[22:53.79]I think I'm ready for the game.
[23:00.08]I thought that was my PC?
[23:02.33]Alright, quests.
[23:05.41]DBTS quest or LFL quest.
[23:07.92]I don't know what that means, but I'm going to pick the first one.
[23:11.40]What is your name?
[23:13.25]Oh, um...
[23:26.46]Billy.
[23:28.26]What difficulty?
[23:28.91]We're not doing the hard shit.
[23:29.83]I'm sorry.
[23:30.35]We're going to do... Squire is probably really hard.
[23:34.89]I'm going to go Knight.
[23:36.12]I think Knight is fine.
[23:38.88]I'm not doing Lord.
[23:39.74]That's outrageous.
[23:49.17]Alright, here we go.
[23:51.12]Cutscene.
[23:51.40]Shh.
[23:51.58]Shh.
[24:02.27]This is fucking crunchy.
[24:05.25]Uh oh.
[24:05.55]Bandits!
[24:18.55]This guy's cute.
[24:19.31]I like this guy.
[24:25.10]Oh, he sucks.
[24:33.86]I wanna play as this guy!
[24:49.86]Wait, what?
[24:51.28]Oh no!
[24:52.53]Alright, let's do it.
[24:53.45]I gotta go find Maya?
[25:01.54]Dude, fighting one enemy is gonna be awful.
[25:03.78]Fighting 30 of these things, I'm gonna die.
[25:11.31]Holy shit.
[25:12.53]Just barely made it.
[25:20.62]Okay, here we go.
[25:22.26]Auto save.
[25:24.52]How do you block?
[25:27.07]What's block?
[25:28.49]Wasn't it B?
[25:31.83]Am I blocking when I'm holding B?
[25:34.39]That's a terrible place for that.
[25:35.53]That's awful.
[25:37.51]I gotta change that right now.
[25:40.94]It's not right mouse.
[25:41.60]It's gotta be right mouse.
[25:47.31]Controller layout.
[25:49.97]I can't change the fucking controls.
[25:52.12]Alright, hold on.
[25:54.42]I'll deal with it.
[25:58.23]You bastards!
[25:59.55]Where is she?
[26:01.56]Come here!
[26:06.15]What is he doing?
[26:06.89]Why are you... Oh... Is he... Okay, he lost a leg.
[26:12.31]Why is he like Yoda now?
[26:13.29]He can do like Yoda moves.
[26:22.87]Did I cut his head off?
[26:24.79]How is he still alive?
[26:29.85]Is this unfair?
[26:34.28]Is he dead?
[26:35.80]Oh, hell yeah.
[26:36.76]Alright, give me the jewels.
[26:40.15]How do you pick up stuff on him?
[26:42.78]Breadstick!
[26:44.82]How does he have a breadstick?
[26:54.07]What?
[26:56.44]How do I eat the breadstick?
[26:58.00]Tab?
[27:09.62]Okay, this is closed off.
[27:19.18]Does he maybe pull this?
[27:22.95]I can't activate this.
[27:23.73]Alright, let's try this way.
[27:26.14]What about... Wait, it might be something in the crates.
[27:40.16]Uh, bros, there's nothing in the crates.
[27:44.89]What about this, like, bag of grain?
[27:46.33]No.
[27:47.75]Oh, this way?
[27:49.23]Yep.
[28:01.68]Oh, shit!
[28:08.61]Into the fire.
[28:12.32]Can you burn?
[28:16.03]Come on.
[28:19.13]Oh, shit.
[28:25.48]Take his head off.
[28:40.96]What did he say?
[28:41.72]Am I alright?
[28:46.07]Is he alive?
[28:49.49]Okay, he's dead, I think.
[28:57.42]He didn't have anything on him.
[29:03.37]Okay, what about the bed?
[29:04.01]Can I sleep in the bed?
[29:04.63]Can I eat something?
[29:05.23]Can I cook food?
[29:07.71]What's this?
[29:08.57]There's like a big turkey leg on the ground.
[29:09.83]Can I not eat it?
[29:18.73]Another breadstick.
[29:19.51]Nice.
[29:22.67]Okay.
[29:27.82]I don't know how to eat, though.
[29:29.74]Alright, that was a cool little dungeon.
[29:34.81]Oh, I have to... My sword has to be a sheet to use a lever.
[29:36.93]I got it.
[29:41.40]Okay.
[29:44.88]I love this ground.
[29:46.19]This ground is honestly was a bitrate look like I feel like this ground is an anti bitrate ground.
[30:01.36]I got past the first gate.
[30:02.54]That's the first test man.
[30:05.74]Alright, let's go.
[30:17.13]So what's got your fur in a bunch?
[30:19.27]Come here.
[30:23.82]He's luring me.
[30:26.58]I knew it!
[30:27.06]I played too many Dark Souls games.
[30:28.66]That's like three of them though.
[30:30.41]This is actually horrible.
[30:36.89]Slutty hell!
[30:43.62]Oh shit.
[30:43.80]Is that all you got?
[30:46.78]Come here, you little shit!
[30:49.74]I need more range.
[30:56.35]I don't know how much HP I have, but it's apparently a lot.
[31:11.68]I don't know how much health I have.
[31:17.90]How do I eat the breadstick?
[31:19.22]Does anybody know?
[31:21.38]You are so injured right now.
[31:22.76]Am I?
[31:23.02]You already ate it?
[31:29.17]Oh, you auto-eat.
[31:30.25]Okay.
[31:32.58]What's this?
[31:36.70]New weapon unlocked.
[31:39.18]Rat Cleaver or whatever this is.
[31:46.94]Alright, there's nobody behind me, right?
[31:58.07]That's funny that you can do that.
[32:04.22]Where'd the weapon go?
[32:10.86]Where'd the weapon go?
[32:12.53]Where's my weapon?
[32:13.89]What happened to it?
[32:19.81]Ooh, good sword play.
[32:30.29]Excellent sword play from this one.
[32:31.81]Dude, this is the best swordsman they got.
[32:49.53]Dude, my legs are gonna come off, my legs are gonna come off, my legs are gonna come off, look at my leg.
[32:57.34]It's bad.
[33:06.29]How is he still alive?
[33:10.41]Oh shi- Shit.
[33:20.36]Now what?
[33:21.36]Oh.
[33:23.81]Alright, I'm good.
[33:27.35]Okay.
[33:28.17]You know what?
[33:28.55]I gotta get down.
[33:30.07]You gotta be very deliberate.
[33:33.30]It's just left, right.
[33:35.88]I'm doing tiny movements here.
[33:38.80]Up, down.
[33:40.31]Up, down.
[33:43.03]I really need to bind a block.
[33:45.85]But who needs a block?
[33:47.88]Just don't get hit.
[33:54.72]It's called aiming.
[33:59.92]Time that person out for... whatever.
[34:02.83]Alright, back up.
[34:12.28]Shit, I gotta get out of here.
[34:26.54]Slow movements.
[34:27.50]Slow movements.
[34:29.03]Slow, steady movements.
[34:31.11]Slow, steady movements.
[34:33.03]Slow movements.
[34:47.00]I'm dead already.
[34:48.13]I didn't even get a chance.
[34:49.31]Hold on.
[34:50.71]Alright, let me go back.
[34:52.07]I need to be a block on right click.
[35:08.98]Yeah, weapon block mode B. That was awful.
[35:16.11]Right, wait.
[35:18.85]What's going on?
[35:19.58]Is it... It was right click the whole time?
[35:30.43]No, because right click was sheathing my... Oh, I have to unbind this.
[35:35.49]How do I delete this?
[35:40.24]How do I remove that?
[35:44.42]I can't unbind it.
[35:47.57]Delete, maybe?
[35:54.10]I'm afraid to press buttons now.
[35:56.98]Oh, okay.
[35:58.10]I got rid of it.
[35:59.38]Sheath is H. Weapon block mode is right button.
[36:03.97]Good.
[36:04.43]Okay.
[36:05.39]Sheath is H. Action, left shift.
[36:08.60]We're good.
[36:09.24]I think we're ready to go.
[36:12.03]Okay.
[36:13.37]Um, how do I load a game?
[36:17.23]I didn't lose the autosave, did I?
[36:18.44]Even if I did, it's fine.
[36:22.84]Oh, here we go.
[36:23.24]Billy.
[36:23.88]That's us.
[36:26.74]Alright.
[36:26.92]Let's see.
[36:32.93]I'm holding right click.
[36:36.49]I have absolutely no idea what that's changing.
[36:46.79]I'm just kind of standing up a little straighter.
[36:55.60]Get the one that's running.
[37:16.73]Can they hit each other?
[37:17.47]Get him!
[37:25.02]Get him!
[37:31.71]I yield!
[37:32.15]I yield, please!
[37:33.75]I yield!
[37:36.23]Oh, this was a terrible idea.
[37:38.61]This was a terrible idea.
[37:41.32]I can one man fight seven rats at the same time.
[37:44.06]They're a human size!
[37:46.55]I yield!
[37:49.45]Look, that's all it is.
[37:50.29]I understand.
[37:50.85]I know you guys love the Olive Garden.
[37:53.88]Let's take those breadsticks.
[37:55.74]Let's add a couple of soups.
[37:57.70]And a couple of salads.
[38:01.52]I'm gonna die.
[38:07.69]One of them is definitely almost dead.
[38:25.88]I might have to turn off the mouse swinging.
[38:30.01]Should I turn it off?
[38:38.60]I'm still alive.
[38:40.22]No.
[38:41.22]Okay.
[38:41.66]Alright.
[38:42.00]Alright.
[38:42.22]Alright.
[38:42.44]Alright.
[38:42.66]Alright.
[38:42.90]No more excuses.
[38:43.36]I'm going to get it right here.
[38:47.19]Any breadsticks on the ground?
[38:48.25]There's bones right here.
[38:49.07]I can probably throw bones at him.
[38:51.93]It's one down.
[38:52.41]One down.
[38:52.69]One down.
[38:55.45]He probably has a breadstick on him.
[39:05.21]Nothing?
[39:05.78]What?
[39:06.92]What if I can eat the bone?
[39:09.26]I can't eat the bones?
[39:28.52]Alright, one more and I'm done.
[39:30.33]One more and I'm good.
[39:38.25]Breadstick.
[39:40.20]Yes!
[39:40.74]Alright, we're good.
[40:01.53]Stay out of my... land.
[40:05.01]I don't know.
[40:07.22]Iron key.
[40:11.80]Can I do a weld?
[40:12.72]No, you can't.
[40:14.69]Alright, I got a key.
[40:19.85]Alright, should I clear the whole place and get the... No, no, no.
[40:24.02]Can I use it right here?
[40:27.74]Auto save.
[40:28.70]Ooh, let's go.
[40:30.66]Wait, I want that weapon though.
[40:36.45]This thing might be better.
[40:38.73]Gotta fit it through the door.
[40:47.32]What the fuck?
[40:50.20]Okay.
[40:51.76]Uh, how do I get out of this?
[40:56.93]I can still hit them.
[41:04.36]Wait, they killed me.
[41:05.90]That killed me?
[41:07.28]Was I hanging upside down for too long?
[41:08.92]Alright, watch out for the trap that's right there.
[41:17.07]Alright, there's one guy to the top left.
[41:19.65]And there's a pig man on the right.
[41:22.12]The trap is over here, so I'm going to go... This way, over here to the right.
[41:28.54]There's nothing to do here.
[41:39.76]There's nothing to do here.
[41:42.66]How do I avoid the trap?
[41:47.27]Alright.
[41:47.69]Forget about that sword.
[41:48.59]I'm just going in.
[41:52.25]Maybe you have to cut the rope?
[41:54.35]Oh, man.
[41:56.19]Bro, you have a sword.
[41:57.01]Oh!
[41:58.79]What's good?
[42:02.78]Oh my god!
[42:06.86]I think he cut me down accidentally.
[42:18.17]I'm so glad he's not fighting me right now.
[42:19.80]It's just the pig.
[42:24.01]Ooh, big plays right there.
[42:32.66]I actually blocked all that.
[42:53.42]Okay, I didn't get grabbed by the... Somehow I didn't get snared.
[42:59.97]I think he accidentally cut me down.
[43:02.93]Okay, what if I just go... What if I hold the sword in the air?
[43:10.48]Okay, I got it.
[43:19.57]I gotta... I have to beat these two.
[43:33.24]Will he come over here?
[43:34.02]Okay.
[43:34.55]Can I?
[43:35.83]Jesus!
[43:37.77]I have the high ground.
[43:38.31]That's good.
[43:40.63]What?
[43:43.98]What did he do?
[43:44.42]He just like pushed me over and I died.
[43:46.42]Okay.
[43:51.49]This guy does a ton of damage.
[43:52.83]I have to... Alright.
[43:54.53]This is a runaway fight.
[43:56.50]I just stab when I get a chance.
[44:01.78]Can I leave?
[44:06.36]No.
[44:14.29]Maybe I should stay in close.
[44:24.00]This guy is so weird.
[44:27.45]I feel like I'm playing another Flare, honestly.
[44:31.53]Oh my God, this guy is so ridiculous.
[44:39.98]He's like ultra powered.
[44:41.50]How do I kill this guy?
[44:58.65]This is the second enemy.
[44:59.71]I'll do it.
[45:00.17]I'll do it.
[45:00.51]I'll do it.
[45:00.81]I'll do it.
[45:01.83]I'm going to take this axe.
[45:05.83]You're getting skill capped, dude.
[45:08.06]I know I am.
[45:09.12]You don't think I know that?
[45:10.96]I know I'm getting skill capped.
[45:14.30]I think I killed him.
[45:14.82]I hit him right in the face.
[45:24.41]This might be the strategy.
[45:25.21]Just use this as a fucking bungee cord.
[45:31.49]Damn it!
[45:33.97]This is so hard!
[45:36.03]I'll play on night difficulty.
[45:37.70]I should have picked easy.
[45:52.86]Can you grab the enemy's weapon?
[46:03.30]Why do I do better when I'm upside down?
[46:04.94]That's just stupid.
[46:05.88]And where's my camera?
[46:14.21]No!
[46:14.29]He does too much damage.
[46:15.81]He does too much damage.
[46:20.61]Jump over the trap?
[46:28.86]What the hell?
[46:29.20]I'll run you through!
[46:34.67]I'm already dead, dude!
[46:52.22]Cut the rope?
[46:53.44]Yeah, let me cut the rope!
[47:15.15]I wish I could throw a projectile.
[47:16.61]I wish I could throw something at him.
[47:28.30]Oh, what's that?
[47:31.63]Oh, the little rope trap.
[47:33.01]Can't get you when you're over here.
[47:34.25]Get it.
[47:34.69]And you haven't, I haven't even spawned your AI yet.
[47:36.65]So I'm just going to cut your fucking throat like this.
[47:47.60]If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
[48:04.36]How are you still blocking me?
[48:05.81]How are you better at blocking than me when your AI doesn't even work?
[48:19.78]Oh shit!
[48:20.62]Oh shit, is he angry?
[48:22.18]Oh!
[48:25.89]Why is he pointing at this guy?
[48:46.56]Oh no.
[48:48.26]I want to be able to loot him!
[48:50.83]I wouldn't be able to loot him.
[48:51.93]It's gonna- I'm not gonna be able to loot him through this.
[49:09.22]You see how many hits this guy takes?
[49:12.08]There's no- This guy's impossible.
[49:16.85]Without the Jerma skip, this guy's impossible.
[49:33.86]No, no, no.
[50:01.79]Well, at least we know the strat now.
[50:04.05]And I... Can I not... Okay.
[50:06.80]Will he even attack me?
[50:07.72]Can I just practice hitting this guy in the face?
[50:11.87]Let's get it right on his head.
[50:14.47]Ha ha ha!
[50:32.50]Dude, I can see his brain.
[50:33.90]Why is he alive?
[50:34.79]I can see his brain.
[50:38.15]This guy is more red than person right now.
[51:02.07]You might not be swinging right.
[51:05.37]I mean, dude, I... I've tried it every which way.
[51:09.82]This is just the way it is, okay?
[51:14.73]I'm going right to left.
[51:17.41]Left to right.
[51:18.37]I'm trying, like, up, down.
[51:20.26]Up, down.
[51:22.30]I'm trying corner to corner.
[51:26.53]Oh!
[51:27.01]Somebody just got smoked.
[51:31.72]Okay, now you.
[51:34.12]Oh, my God.
[51:36.82]Larry, I didn't think he was actually going to be able to beat us.
[51:40.31]Oh, you know, can I join your team, maybe?
[51:44.45]Oh, somebody's AI didn't load, did it?
[51:48.12]I'll spell your gut.
[51:56.61]I'll spell your gut.
[52:09.16]Yeah.
[52:15.67]We're good.
[52:16.98]Yeah.
[52:20.84]What does he got?
[52:22.65]That's a steel key.
[52:29.10]And I picked up a dead rat.
[52:31.52]Can I pick up his weapon?
[52:34.02]I want that axe so bad.
[52:38.58]Autosave, let's go.
[52:43.06]Nice.
[52:45.12]Okay, what's next?
[52:51.87]Fighters.
[52:54.55]I'm ready.
[52:58.44]Is that a health potion?
[52:59.24]What is that?
[53:01.64]What does that sound?
[53:12.01]Ooh, alright.
[53:12.75]I'm at full health now.
[53:21.62]This area is huge.
[53:22.34]I don't like this.
[53:23.35]Wait, scouting!
[53:31.02]It's another fucking giant pig guy.
[53:54.73]Stock it don't my God.
[53:56.45]What is he doing?
[54:01.44]Little weirdo.
[54:04.12]Is he moving all the boxes?
[54:16.15]He's having like he's like happy doing this.
[54:18.00]He's having like fun.
[54:21.16]OK, don't go in the water.
[54:26.05]Can I go- Can I hide in here?
[54:30.94]I might be able to hide in this.
[54:31.80]I think I'm just going for it.
[54:37.60]Okay, hold him back.
[54:41.57]Um... Why is the camera doing this to me?
[54:45.33]What is- Dude, what is the cam- Why- Why did it turn into Resident Evil?
[54:50.06]Like, I'm trying to play!
[54:52.00]What the fuck?!
[54:53.92]No, stop doing that!
[54:58.13]Drown them, drown them.
[55:02.86]They'll fall in the water.
[55:11.05]There's no way, dude.
[55:13.23]Wait, can I?
[55:20.12]Oh my God, why is the camera doing this?
[55:23.82]That was- Oh, holy shit!

[55:50.29]Come on.
[55:51.43]Come on.
[55:53.92]No, no, he broke the box.
[55:59.07]Shit.
[56:00.07]Okay, if I climb up here, it's C. If I climb up there and I can get up there and I'm just going to aim down and just poke at people's heads.
[56:26.78]I could also... Is there anyone to go this way?
[56:29.64]Let me check over here first.
[56:30.56]I don't think so.
[56:34.20]Alright.
[56:34.86]I'm gonna aggro everybody.
[56:40.07]Okay.
[56:41.11]I wanna get on top of that box.
[56:43.57]Gonna go for it.
[56:44.09]We're gonna climb with C. Perfect.
[56:49.44]You fucking idiot.
[56:51.62]What are you doing?
[56:54.56]Climb the box!
[56:58.91]Okay.
[57:00.01]Now.
[57:01.27]Go.
[57:05.04]Okay.
[57:05.46]He's down there.
[57:06.04]He definitely can't get up here.
[57:07.86]This is perfect.
[57:14.23]Now, take the sword out.
[57:16.49]Aim.
[57:18.42]Ah.
[57:19.38]Okay.
[57:19.86]Aim down.
[57:22.72]Aim down.

[57:41.99]Stay in the water.
[57:42.83]Stay in the water.
[57:43.33]Stay in the water.
[57:44.17]Stay in the water.
[57:46.72]Get me up.
[57:47.06]Get me up.
[57:49.26]Okay.
[57:50.92]He's going to drown too.
[57:55.13]He's going to drown too, right?
[57:56.95]Okay.
[57:57.45]Here's my plan.
[57:58.77]My plan is...
[58:00.80]I'm gonna jump in the water, I'm gonna aggro everybody into the water, and then I'm getting out of the water and they're all gonna drown.
[58:06.34]Then I'm gonna jump back into the water and loot the bodies and leave.
[58:13.09]Okay.
[58:16.58]There we go.
[58:30.32]Come and get me.
[58:43.28]Oh, he's in the water.
[58:44.90]Dive in the water and drown yourself.
[58:51.99]Go on.
[58:53.39]Do it.
[58:58.00]Come get me.
[59:02.41]Help, help!
[59:07.42]Get in the water!
[59:11.13]Okay.
[59:11.69]That's one down?
[59:12.39]In the water?
[59:20.22]Bye.
[59:21.50]See you later.
[59:27.77]And don't let the door hit you on the way out!
[59:31.11]I did it!
[59:32.55]I actually just did it.
[59:33.69]I won.
[59:36.78]I just beat level one.
[59:44.03]I don't, yeah, I don't know why that moved.
[59:45.63]It didn't move the last time I was on it.
[59:50.09]Alright.
[59:52.26]I'm going to, I'm going to take a break.
[59:53.64]I'll be back.
[59:55.48]We'll watch this cut scene and then I'll take a break.
[60:09.59]Two warthog people?
[60:10.64]This is going to be awful.
[60:28.40]Oh god, okay.
[60:29.06]Okay, if they're afraid of that, then I should be afraid of that, right?
[60:37.11]Alright, I made it.
[60:39.67]Auto-save.
[60:40.97]That thing is... Okay, I'm going to pause it right here.
[60:46.73]It's like jumping at me.
[60:50.00]I'll be right back.
[60:52.56]See you guys in a few minutes.
[60:53.98]I'm going to get... I'm going to refill a tea.
[60:57.09]Hear me?
[60:59.07]Okay, that just... That just scared the shit out of me.
[61:02.38]I thought that was... I thought my facecam was on.
[61:04.76]And like, why am I making that face right now?
[61:08.93]What the fuck?
[61:09.84]Okay, I'll be right back.
[65:19.67]How are you?
[65:23.16]How's it going?
[65:23.76]What's up?
[65:30.97]I'm playing Piglet's Big Game with this in the background.
[65:35.15]Based.
[65:37.30]I think.
[65:42.24]Alright.
[65:43.93]I am back.
[65:44.59]We're ready.
[65:45.05]I saw something jumping in the water and it was scary.
[65:54.25]Let's find out what it was.
[65:55.47]Are you all ready?
[66:02.96]Here we go.
[66:06.28]Okay, something in the water.
[66:09.05]It's... It can... It can board the ship.
[66:12.09]Okay.
[66:12.21]I'll just avoid him because I don't... Get back.
[66:21.80]I want to get back on the boat.
[66:26.45]What?
[66:31.26]Dude, I was just doing backflips in the water.
[66:34.93]Is my armor really top heavy?
[66:36.63]Does it maybe go backwards like five times?
[66:39.62]Alright, put the sword away.
[66:40.68]The camera angle changes.
[66:42.81]Up becomes left, down becomes right.
[66:55.49]How long is this fucking boat ride?
[67:21.53]Dude, just kill it.
[67:22.41]When I take the sword out, it changes my camera to something crazy.
[67:32.44]I'm just going to crouch and stick the sword in front of me.
[67:36.79]That did not work at all.
[67:38.75]Completely meaningless.
[67:44.52]Dude, the water is supposed to be your domain.
[67:49.88]He sucks in the water.
[67:51.32]Oh, no, he doesn't.
[67:58.14]Okay.
[67:59.67]I tell you, I had the right strategy before.
[68:01.19]Put the sword away.
[68:02.89]Just do dodges.
[68:05.71]Just dodge.
[68:07.15]Don't fight.
[68:07.73]Just dodge.
[68:08.25]And then there's a place I can jump.
[68:09.46]There's a little cove over here.
[68:13.18]I'm going to get hurt, but it's alright.
[68:14.10]I got breadstick probably waiting for me.
[68:23.15]Good.
[68:32.95]Good.
[68:37.32]Good.
[68:38.42]Where's the, where is it?
[68:40.36]Right here?
[68:42.08]Ow!
[68:44.25]Alright, okay, I think I'm safe.
[68:45.85]Oh my god, no I'm not.
[68:47.55]Crouch, go!
[68:48.27]Crouch, crouch!
[68:49.15]Please!
[68:50.29]Please crouch under this.
[68:52.13]I can't fit in there?
[68:52.99]What are you talking about?
[68:53.99]Why is this here?
[68:55.43]Why is this even here if I can't fit in this?
[68:58.32]What's this do?
[69:08.11]Keep going.
[69:08.51]Run.
[69:09.19]Run, run, run, run, run.
[69:10.41]Fuck it.
[69:11.13]Fuck it.
[69:11.45]I ain't dealing with that guy.
[69:15.78]That water is so loud.
[69:21.15]I think I made it.
[69:24.92]Okay.
[69:26.30]Oh shit.
[69:29.17]Do any frogs?
[69:42.35]This is the kind of fighting that you see in a play.
[69:45.95]The only thing that's missing is goofy piano music of playing one of the theme songs of the play.
[69:52.36]I can't even fight them because the camera whips around.
[69:55.00]Wait, mods just put camera control?
[69:56.76]Put R?
[69:57.54]Press R. Dude, this guy can't kill anything.
[70:09.03]I'm just telling you, this is a run?
[70:10.65]This is a run.
[70:11.69]Don't even fight.
[70:12.17]This is a run.
[70:12.93]Put the sword away.
[70:13.96]Get the extra speed.
[70:15.86]And just run.
[70:16.74]Why fight anything?
[70:18.00]What, for the breadsticks?
[70:20.58]This one's already dead.
[70:24.47]Okay, there's another raft to go on, but no, no, no, no.
[70:28.19]What's this?
[70:34.04]Dude, I made it to the truck.
[70:35.24]Oh, shit.
[70:38.83]I made it to the hatchery.
[70:40.13]I made it to the hatchery.
[70:40.95]This is a boss.
[70:42.29]Can I pick up the eggs?
[70:43.49]Destroy the eggs.
[70:44.33]Destroy the eggs.
[70:45.45]Destroy the eggs.
[70:46.96]Destroy the eggs.
[70:51.30]Oh, shit.
[70:52.98]Wait, there's a dead one.
[70:55.86]A ring of shielding, bro.
[70:58.40]Ring of shielding.
[71:00.06]Okay, I'm out.
[71:16.17]Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.
[71:19.23]Come on, move.
[71:21.51]Move.
[71:22.78]Move.
[71:23.87]Move!
[71:24.35]Move this thing, please!
[71:26.13]Move!
[71:30.28]Where do I go?
[71:37.45]What?
[71:41.22]It's the same raft?
[71:43.48]I can't- How- What am I supposed to go?
[71:45.41]I think I have to kill this stuff.
[71:55.37]I have no idea what's going on.
[71:58.04]I can't... I know people saying, dude, why don't you just fight?
[72:00.88]Um, I... I can't.
[72:02.62]It's... I think I'm safe.
[72:13.15]Dude, I think I'm good.
[72:22.48]The ferns.
[72:24.22]Dude, I'm exploring this whole area.
[72:26.06]This is like running through, okay.
[72:28.38]I feel like I am sprinting in Dark Souls to go to a boss area.
[72:33.67]I'm just running through the zone.
[72:34.69]Okay, I know, I remember this, run fast.
[72:36.13]That guy, run fast.
[72:36.75]This guy, you got the frog over there.
[72:38.58]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[72:44.20]Come on, get up.
[72:47.31]I feel, I'm feeling the fucking tutorial that I just did.
[72:55.09]I can't grab it!
[72:57.60]This is so fucked up!
[73:04.78]Um... Go.
[73:21.18]Oh my god!
[73:27.39]What is this guy even doing down here?
[73:29.70]What a miserable, horrible place to be.
[73:50.20]Climb it!
[73:50.70]Climb!
[73:52.30]They kill you in one hit!
[73:55.71]Yeah.
[73:56.05]Oh, why don't I just turn around and fight this guy?
[73:58.25]He punches me with his green Hulk hand once and I die instantly.
[74:04.78]You know what?
[74:05.28]Fine.
[74:06.82]Let's go.
[74:08.03]No, not that one.
[74:08.65]Not that one.
[74:09.07]I don't want to fight the blue one.
[74:10.11]I don't want to fight the blue one.
[74:11.23]I'm not fighting the blue one.
[74:12.59]The blue one is a little too hard.
[74:14.41]I'm not fighting the blue one.
[74:31.52]Also, somebody said earlier the water is 60 FPS.
[74:34.50]The rest of the game isn't.
[74:35.72]That's actually really funny.
[74:42.69]Okay, just I gotta... Did I trip on the... I tripped on the stairs.
[74:51.69]I tripped on the stairs.
[74:53.77]That is un... That's unbelievable.
[75:04.09]I want to try it without this bullshit.
[75:13.54]Okay.
[75:15.52]Keyboard?
[75:17.67]Wait, I can't.
[75:19.57]Because I don't have the right keys.
[75:23.31]I need a longer keyboard for this.
[75:30.06]I don't have a numpad.
[75:37.58]I just have to get good.
[75:53.22]I... I was about to celebrate.
[76:01.31]I don't know.
[76:16.24]Dude, they're fucking firing fucking spears out of my side.
[76:20.69]I have to do... What do I do?
[76:23.24]Duck?
[76:24.90]This is insane.
[76:32.71]Maybe jump over them?
[76:33.94]Oh my... I have to kill this thing in here.
[76:36.42]Alright, let me...
[76:46.47]Guard the edge.
[76:54.12]Oh my God, you die in one hit.
[77:08.22]The start of fresh Dark Souls 2 run.
[77:10.14]This does kind of look like the first area Dark Souls 2.
[77:12.37]It does.
[77:21.70]Fire, please!
[77:24.87]Duck!
[77:26.27]It shot me in the fucking head.
[77:31.99]Okay.
[77:34.00]Jump?
[77:39.12]I think I have to jump over it.
[77:41.27]And there's definitely gonna be like three or four of them in a row.
[77:54.76]Oh shit.
[77:56.72]What the fuck?
[77:59.75]Duck on the second one.
[78:01.13]Duck the second one.
[78:05.74]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[78:08.92]Jump over the first one.
[78:10.47]Duck the second one.
[78:13.97]You can crawl?
[78:14.77]Wait, can you actually go prone?
[78:16.54]How do you do that?
[78:25.68]That was just not a good run.
[78:29.50]That was not a good run.
[78:30.46]That was a bad one.
[78:35.45]I gotta get through this area.
[78:36.65]I have to.
[78:37.23]I've already speedran it already.
[78:39.29]I can do it.
[78:40.88]It's jump and then maybe... Somebody said you can trigger it before it happens.
[78:52.05]No, you can't, dude.
[78:53.43]You cannot.
[79:03.61]Maybe I could block it?
[79:09.24]Use my sword?
[79:10.02]Did you see him taking one hit kills here?
[79:17.81]OK.
[79:24.90]I don't know man, this seems crazy.
[79:28.74]A T hit T.
[79:32.05]The hitbox is a massive square.
[79:34.55]Maybe try to maybe try to get it to hit the shield.
[79:39.16]OK, I'll try that.
[79:55.20]Oh my God.
[80:05.04]Oh my god.
[80:06.12]Go behind the waterfall?
[80:27.58]Press C to climb!
[80:29.76]C!
[80:47.17]I'll get it.
[80:47.66]I'll get it right here.
[80:48.19]This is the one.
[81:36.72]Get up there, you Super Mario!
[81:39.08]Come on!
[81:39.72]I can't... Why is he so stupid?
[81:42.62]Okay, I'm going to take it.
[81:45.53]It's crazily slow.
[81:54.92]Here's the thing.
[81:55.60]I could kill them maybe if I tried as hard as I can, but then I could die in one hit to the trap.
[82:10.67]The shield doesn't block it.
[82:16.32]Look it.
[82:16.76]It went through the shield.
[82:18.08]It hit the shield and killed me.
[82:21.15]You just have to jump it.
[82:22.09]Yeah.
[82:22.39]Alright.
[82:22.73]Alright.
[82:23.01]We're speed running now.
[82:23.79]I'm just going as fast as I can.
[82:24.91]Who cares?
[82:45.72]You should restart the level.
[82:48.48]I don't think that's going to help me at all.
[82:52.41]I'll get it.
[82:52.87]I'm going to get it.
[82:53.49]I'm going to get it.
[82:53.97]It's this one right here.
[83:04.30]Oh, no.
[83:09.73]I'm so close.
[83:10.65]I feel like this is the end of it right here.
[83:12.12]I have to do it.
[83:12.94]I'm going to get it.
[83:32.36]Alright, he just went from my left ear to the center of my brain out through the right ear and ate his whole way through.
[84:00.19]He just punched me in the balls and I died.
[84:02.59]Oh, I... He just reached up and hit... Oh, come on, man.
[84:12.17]Alright, three more tries and then I'm going to make the difficulties easier.
[84:15.81]I want to see more of this game.
[84:17.08]This game, I actually like it.
[84:18.52]It's hilarious.
[84:20.12]This game is really fun and funny.
[84:21.56]I like it.
[84:31.90]I think they're a one-hit kill because you have low HP.
[84:37.31]Is that what's gon- wait.
[84:39.23]Do I have low- I thought I just ranked it- wait.
[84:44.60]You haven't healed.
[84:46.96]Jump into the waterfall.
[84:54.19]Holy shit!
[84:55.18]Oh my god!
[84:55.68]Oh my god!
[84:56.62]Oh my god!
[85:11.18]How do I save the game?
[85:14.25]Oh, I can't save the game.
[85:16.25]There's no save game, is there?
[85:24.16]Oh no, OK, I gotta go.
[85:25.26]I gotta go.
[85:25.66]I gotta get good right now.
[85:29.97]Why can't I move?
[85:43.60]Are we good?
[85:52.75]Scout!
[86:01.26]Wait, uh-oh.
[86:10.83]Oh my god!
[86:12.74]I forgot I have the entire game behind me.
[86:22.94]Get him!
[86:23.90]Kill him!
[86:24.30]Come on!
[86:27.37]He's doing work.
[86:31.20]Oh no, he lost an arm.
[86:34.00]Oh no.
[86:35.73]Oh, shit, this is bad.
[86:38.48]Ah, boys, I don't know.
[86:39.60]This is not looking great.
[86:40.80]Well, I'm not sure how I get out of this scenario.
[87:06.10]Oh, shit!
[87:16.72]Oh, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright.
[87:18.04]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[87:18.94]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[87:19.86]It's right here.
[87:22.75]There's an elevator right there.
[87:25.29]I'm probably missing so many items.
[87:28.22]Alright, get in the elevator.
[87:31.26]How do you turn the elevator on?
[87:33.04]Jesus.
[87:43.92]I think I have to pull that.
[87:56.10]Look at how long that takes.
[88:00.52]That takes forever.
[88:02.12]Okay.
[88:04.47]I just got to run around.
[88:05.69]Pull that and run around.
[88:09.67]That guy wasn't even trying to attack me.
[88:13.18]He just, I don't know, whatever.
[88:15.12]I died, whatever.
[88:20.01]I ran into his axe.
[88:23.46]Well, actually, this might be a pretty good strat because they don't care about me.
[88:28.56]If they aggro to the swamp people, whatever.
[88:33.49]Pull the lever.
[88:39.44]Get away from me.
[88:44.62]No!
[88:50.79]They're killing each other.
[88:52.43]Alright, new strategy.
[88:54.30]New strategy.
[88:57.48]Take the sword out.
[89:18.96]Oh, fuck you.
[89:19.92]You ain't getting up here.
[89:22.46]Oh.
[89:23.44]Am I good?
[89:27.01]I'm good.
[89:28.51]Oh, no.
[89:30.41]Massacre down there.
[89:32.20]Oh, Jesus.
[89:34.64]I thought the elevator was going back down.
[89:41.53]Okay.
[89:42.05]All I'm saying... I got...
[89:48.00]10 out of 10.
[89:48.54]5 out of 10.
[89:49.80]I missed an area.
[89:52.23]15.
[89:52.87]I got a perfect score except for dying.
[90:02.52]Let's see what's next.
[90:18.14]Okay, so there's even more enemies now.
[90:24.29]Okay.
[90:26.23]I can take two of these.
[90:27.80]Get a few breadsticks.
[90:37.91]Okay, that goes back down, and... Oh my god!
[90:49.88]I can't push it.
[90:56.48]Alright, I got a kill.
[90:59.16]Yep.
[90:59.34]Okay.
[90:59.52]This is a must-win scenario fight room.
[91:05.46]Good start.
[91:22.48]Oh, come on.
[91:45.22]You still have one HP.
[91:48.31]Don't worry, I'll get it.
[91:53.11]Come get me, all of you.
[91:55.29]Oh my god, look, I don't have a sword.
[91:56.67]I'm so vulnerable.
[91:57.41]You can kill me right now.
[92:12.39]I'm trying to get him to jump into the pit, but that would be kind of bad because I think he has a key on him.
[92:25.00]Oh my God, dude.
[92:48.40]Okay.
[92:49.90]need to go back and not waste the potion in the waterfall no I just have to be good I have to play really good there's a turkey here oh hold on a minute dude there's a turkey here I'm hearing there's a turkey where's the turkey oh I okay

[93:37.81]This is Looney Tunes type shit right there.
[93:42.92]Alright, wait, there's a turkey leg?
[93:44.94]Where's the turkey leg?
[93:45.76]This thing is spinning.
[93:56.50]Where's the... Where's the turkey leg?
[94:00.17]I don't see a turkey leg anywhere.
[94:01.73]Was I lied to?
[94:03.37]Is it in the crate?
[94:15.37]God, the whole... The whole ground may as well be a turkey leg, okay?
[94:18.21]I can't see it.
[94:19.17]What's that?
[94:19.55]It's right there.
[94:22.68]I got a piece... I got... Okay, okay, okay.
[94:25.88]Huge.
[94:43.73]What the hell?
[95:01.58]Trying to get him in the leg.
[95:13.03]Good hit, good hit.
[95:20.21]F3 shows all health bars.
[95:24.00]What?
[95:25.56]Oh my god, there's a health bar.
[95:27.02]Okay, what else?
[95:28.68]Toggle the compass on with F5.
[95:35.33]There is a quicksave!
[95:37.23]F5 is quicksave!
[95:38.47]I have zero HP!
[95:55.54]That's all the health I have?
[95:57.08]No wonder I'm getting my ass kicked.
[95:58.93]No wonder I'm getting destroyed.
[96:00.43]What a mystery this isn't anymore.
[96:03.44]Okay.
[96:05.16]I need to get in a safe spot.
[96:07.65]Make sure there's nothing that can kill me with a softlock.
[96:09.53]I'm good.
[96:27.46]I'm so screwed.
[96:39.02]Use F8 to heal.
[96:42.44]That's probably like quick load or I don't know what that is.
[96:47.17]We gotta get creative here.
[96:49.11]I gotta get I gotta get creative.
[96:52.41]OK, here's how we get creative.
[97:06.56]I gotta get creative, I have to.
[97:10.17]Okay, what can I do here?
[97:12.51]What can I do here?
[97:15.64]I have an idea.
[97:17.42]Okay, I can do this.
[97:22.09]Up into the wall, I'm gonna find a spot that I can get stuck in.
[97:38.64]Ooh, actually, I got better.
[97:42.69]Is F8 actually quick load?
[97:43.75]Because I was going to keep doing it.
[97:57.11]Good, good, good!
[98:03.32]Good!
[98:09.54]Good!
[98:15.89]Okay, I just have to be- I just have to treat myself like I'm just gonna charge.
[98:19.07]He can't handle the charging.
[98:20.38]He can't handle the charging animation.
[98:33.37]Get up, please.
[98:52.30]I got so greedy.
[98:54.49]I got so greedy for no reason.
[99:02.12]He's streaming, so this is ethical save scum.
[99:06.50]F8?
[99:11.95]Is it F8?
[99:22.78]Good.
[99:23.56]Beautiful.
[99:30.77]This one went behind my back.
[99:49.41]I got too gritty.
[99:50.25]I got too gritty.
[99:50.83]It was a greed.
[99:53.80]He's almost dead.
[100:21.89]Oh, come on.
[100:34.41]No, I can't.
[100:35.23]I want the health.
[100:36.07]I want the health.
[100:38.51]I need the health.
[100:39.15]I can't do everything with zero HP.
[100:43.32]I'll take 10%, 15% HP.
[100:45.38]That's fine.
[100:46.42]He's almost dead still.
[100:47.92]Getting hit is bad.
[100:51.49]Huge.
[100:53.70]Alright, we're going to go around the merry-go-round.
[100:56.02]Up.
[100:57.05]Huge.
[100:58.35]Save it here.
[100:58.83]Jump over the crates.
[101:00.33]Turn.
[101:03.34]That was, uh, alright.
[101:04.83]I was just doing some tech.
[101:05.93]I was doing some, trying some tech.
[101:31.20]That's a big hit.
[101:39.27]Oh my god, don't softlock myself.
[101:41.39]Yeah, we're good.
[101:56.32]Does he have any food on him?
[102:00.34]Oh, I can just leave.
[102:01.08]I got the key.
[102:01.88]I got the key.
[102:03.20]Let's get out.
[102:11.94]Oh my goodness.
[102:13.10]Um, okay.
[102:14.82]Can people get hit by those?
[102:22.73]Looks like they might be food.
[102:29.20]Break all the shit for me.
[102:29.94]That's fine.
[102:33.38]Nothing?
[102:36.85]Oh, come on, dude.
[102:37.95]A piece of meat.
[102:40.35]That was dumb.
[102:47.00]I think that was really dumb.
[102:59.64]Hmm.
[102:59.74]Something in there, probably.
[103:01.86]Oh.
[103:05.31]Nice.
[103:06.25]Oh, that is unbelievable if I can pick that up and run.
[103:09.42]Oh, that's unbelievable.
[103:14.61]Get out.
[103:25.41]Um...
[103:28.01]They're behind me.
[103:33.02]That's not a good place to save.
[103:35.67]Whoa, why do I have full health?
[103:37.33]Why do I have full health?
[103:41.44]Okay, something weird's going on.
[103:42.46]Hide in here.
[103:55.29]Uh, no, dude!
[103:57.44]That's a terrible place to be!
[103:59.12]That sucks!
[104:11.03]Such ass!
[104:13.06]Somebody has a key in here.
[104:14.30]Oh, no.
[104:16.02]Oh, no.
[104:17.68]Um, okay.
[104:31.74]Yes, there is.
[104:32.32]Open them.
[104:44.28]That's so many pigmen.
[104:49.95]Okay, so for future reference, there was nothing in any of those things.
[104:53.03]It was bait.
[104:54.38]There was literally nothing in any of them.
[104:57.76]And now I'm smooshed into the wall.
[105:00.64]There's...
[105:10.45]There's so many people in this room that have to die.
[105:23.88]Maybe you have the key.
[105:30.87]I don't think I can cheese any of this.
[105:32.33]I don't know guys, this might be un-cheesable.
[105:42.75]Let's go back.
[105:43.31]Is there a cheese ability back here somewhere?
[105:50.74]There's gotta be.
[105:51.30]There has to be cheese somewhere.
[105:58.23]Where there's a cheese, there's a way.
[106:09.26]OK, this is weird.
[106:10.10]This is this is a weird room.
[106:12.15]Maybe I could choose them in here.
[106:24.35]I don't know.
[106:26.87]Oh dear.
[106:29.40]Stay back, stay back, stay back.
[106:49.49]Hey, new background.
[106:50.39]What is that?
[106:52.86]Okay.
[106:55.96]I'm going to make the game easy in the options and then I'm going to run through this.
[107:05.89]Go to the old quick save.
[107:12.82]Options.
[107:15.90]Wait.
[107:18.41]I can't do that.
[107:21.19]There's no option for that, guys.
[107:29.22]Because it would have to be a new game.
[107:34.05]Alright, I'm going to try one more time, and then... Okay.
[107:42.88]Here's my idea.
[107:52.05]I think you can adjust the difficulty in the game.
[107:53.77]Oh my god, we're making it Squire.
[107:59.69]No way dude, it's Squire time.
[108:25.53]I think I cut his head off.
[108:27.97]Where's the health bars?
[108:32.64]I actually did a pretty decent amount of damage to all of them.
[109:02.60]Oh, this is doable.
[109:03.71]This is definitely doable.
[109:09.02]They're going to drop meat?
[109:10.30]Oh, with the right game plan, this is doable.
[109:13.69]I am confident.
[109:15.61]That was just a total fuckface run and I almost did it.
[109:35.29]That one doesn't count.
[109:37.81]No, good, it's on Squire.
[109:38.72]Okay.
[109:40.14]That didn't count.
[109:43.22]This one doesn't count, so if I beat it, who cares?
[109:45.31]It doesn't count.
[109:52.72]Don't run into the room with the two extra dudes.
[109:54.40]Okay, the plan is I'm going to aggro these guys back.
[109:58.24]Fight them in that bigger room.
[110:00.79]There's definitely going to be...
[110:04.70]I'm gonna give this like 10 more minutes and then I'm gonna move on This game is what I love it is wonderful.
[110:27.87]I
[110:39.53]I don't know what happened there.
[110:40.62]I don't know what happened there.
[110:48.13]But yeah, I want to play the arena.
[110:49.83]Apparently the arena is really fun as well.
[110:56.01]Go!
[110:58.09]Go!
[110:58.83]Go!
[111:05.94]Okay, here we go.
[111:07.91]Same deal as last time.
[111:11.13]Yep.
[111:11.23]The camera is... What is the camera doing?
[111:19.97]Alright, I'm doing the arena.
[111:21.53]I want to see how it ends, though.
[111:23.31]There's so much goofy shit.
[111:24.96]I don't know.
[111:25.96]I'm still having fun.
[111:31.96]I gotta figure out, there's gotta be a plan.
[111:34.07]I always can come up with a plan.
[111:35.63]Come on, there's gotta be a plan, Arthur.
[111:41.36]There's gotta be a plan.
[111:43.02]Something weird that's gonna work.
[111:47.59]Put the sword away so I can run.
[111:48.79]I will do this.
[111:57.62]Somebody said, hey, live by the save, die by the save.
[112:01.63]Okay.
[112:02.11]Here we go.
[112:03.15]What do we got here?
[112:03.77]We got... I don't want to get stuck back there.
[112:06.68]What's back here?
[112:07.58]Is there a place to fall?
[112:09.44]There is.
[112:10.00]Alright.
[112:11.16]And there's a place to stand.
[112:12.91]Also... There is... Okay.
[112:17.31]Okay.
[112:18.01]Let's see if I gotta get this right.
[112:26.43]This camera is driving me insane.
[112:44.24]Get me out of here.
[112:45.34]Get me out.
[112:49.07]Alright, arena.
[112:51.43]Billy.
[112:51.79]Okay, I could be a dwarf?
[113:00.86]A goblorg?
[113:02.12]A greeble?
[113:04.77]You could be one of these!
[113:05.75]Oh, you could be a minotaur?

[113:18.17]Skeleton.
[113:18.85]Cool.
[113:19.47]Sorcerer.
[113:20.09]I'm going to be a sorcerer.
[113:21.65]I'm going to be a spirit weapon.
[113:29.92]I'm going to be the sorcerer.
[113:32.06]The weapon I'm going to use is... Okay, you can't pick.

[114:43.97]I don't think so.
[114:47.57]Lava pit?
[114:49.52]Okay, where do we want to go?

[118:16.09]Did I have too many people?
[118:20.60]Come on, I want to do it.
[118:21.90]I want to do that.
[118:22.94]I think I had too many people.

[118:47.36]Okay, that's fine.
[118:49.56]Let's do one more.

[118:54.25]Then a mutant.
[118:55.81]Team.
[118:56.85]Okay.
[118:58.16]And we're going to go to, maybe not the lava, maybe not the, um, doom.
[119:01.82]Pit of Envy.
[119:03.43]Let's go.
[119:06.65]Good to go.
[119:32.53]Dude, this... This guy's already gone.
[119:35.56]See how easy it is to get knocked off?
[119:37.96]And it's easy to get knocked off because the camera... W is now... Okay.
[119:43.09]Oh, shit.
[119:48.89]Dude, it's so stupid!
[119:54.86]Imagine if I changed, if I rotated your controls.
[120:00.04]If you were playing a game and I was like, oh, hey, by the way, every three to five seconds, you're going to need to flip your WASD clockwise to the right.
[120:10.42]A is now up.
[120:12.64]S is now, you know what I mean?
[120:13.62]It's like, come on.
[120:16.39]One more.
[120:29.25]That was Die by the Sword, and it was wonderful.
[120:33.30]I'm glad I played it.
[120:40.13]That was genuinely amazing.
[120:42.67]I'm glad it was fun.
[120:44.36]I may have softlocked myself in the regular game, but I don't think the game is that much longer.
[120:48.98]The game's only a few hours, the campaign.
[120:51.57]But, cool.
[120:52.88]We'll move on to the next one.
[120:54.66]I'll be back.
[120:55.04]I'm going to take a break.
[120:56.10]And we will open up the next game.
[120:58.73]See you in a few minutes.
[121:00.93]BRB.
[121:10.34]Again, I thought it was me again.
[121:14.45]On real cam.
[121:14.97]See you in a minute.
[126:11.69]How's it going?
[126:13.23]Welcome back.
[126:15.42]This next one might be the next maybe 20 minutes or the next 20 hours.
[126:27.31]And that is a joke.
[126:32.03]Start with 20-30 minutes.
[126:36.21]The game is called Bioforge.
[126:39.32]It's a very old game.
[126:43.32]And we're going to check it out right now.
[126:54.11]And you should see it.
[126:58.69]I couldn't full screen this game, so you're going to deal with my background being in the background.
[127:03.86]It is what it is.
[127:13.66]and prisoner AP-127.
[127:16.20]This is unacceptable.
[127:22.39]You guys were watching like a bootleg movie.
[127:27.02]Like, hey bro, come on over and watch, man.
[127:29.07]Yeah, I got the Minions movie.
[127:32.45]Like, oh, okay, cool, great.
[127:35.46]Yeah, it's crazy.
[127:36.44]I don't know how I got it.
[127:38.72]Alright, man.
[127:39.30]I guess this is cool.
[127:42.49]This kind of looks like shit, doesn't it?
[127:44.57]It's like window in a window.
[127:45.47]Yeah, man.
[127:46.27]It's whatever, dude.
[127:46.94]I've got to see it.
[127:51.76]Do alt-enter?
[127:52.54]Alt-enter breaks the game for some reason.
[127:55.19]I could try, but I'm scared.
[127:57.05]Hold on.
[128:05.19]You've played Bioforge?
[128:07.06]Oh no I haven't.
[128:28.06]I think this is an extension of what's going on.
[128:33.83]I have no idea what that is.
[128:39.50]Hey dude, remember this part?
[128:40.28]The minions, right?
[128:43.85]Uh, David, I think you got the wrong file.
[128:48.14]It says the minions?
[128:49.72]Isn't that minions right there?
[128:52.42]I don't think so, dude.
[128:53.49]I think this is a different movie.
[129:03.04]Am I naked?
[129:04.94]Oh shit, I think I'm naked.
[129:09.53]This definitely is not the Minions movie, Eddie.
[129:12.38]Hey, it's not the Minions movie.
[129:17.03]Hey man, are you sure?
[129:17.77]Yeah, I'm sure.
[129:33.96]Oh my god.
[129:44.81]He should have had that up in the beginning, shouldn't he?
[129:49.06]Oh, that's scary.
[130:04.36]Was it not screaming?
[130:07.49]Was that me screaming?
[130:14.60]I was screaming before it hit me.
[130:15.93]Okay, well, that's Bioforge.
[130:31.75]Oh, alright.
[130:32.65]I guess... Oh, okay.
[130:34.30]Here we are.
[130:39.14]I'm telling you, I don't know from what just happened in the last game.
[130:43.65]I don't know, guys.
[130:44.55]I don't think... Any game made before 1999.
[130:49.30]Hard is insane.
[130:50.62]Medium is hard.
[130:51.74]Easy is hard.

[133:46.17]I don't know how to use items.
[133:53.14]Okay, hold on.
[133:55.98]Should I reset the whole game?

[137:08.86]This game is not happy with me.

[137:28.35]Lock in.
[137:29.27]How am I supposed to lock in, man?
[137:31.21]The French translation team is on the screen.
[137:36.62]I did it.
[137:37.94]I did it.
[137:38.84]I did it.
[137:39.34]I did it.
[137:39.68]I'm good.
[137:40.40]I'm good.
[137:47.51]Did I win?
[137:51.00]Okay.
[137:51.42]Alright.
[138:00.56]Let's go!
[138:04.36]What the fuck, it's back on!
[138:05.83]Okay, is there a run?
[138:07.41]How do you run?
[138:12.61]I'm getting out of here!
[138:13.80]Oh god.
[138:18.58]I'm getting out.
[138:20.42]What's this?
[138:21.50]Oh my god, somebody died here.
[138:28.15]What?
[138:29.31]Oh my god, this guy can get out.
[138:34.97]You'll be sorely disappointed.
[138:37.69]Can I eat this guy?
[138:42.16]If you come from a fork, you'll be sorely disappointed.
[138:51.11]I'm coming in.
[138:57.10]No, sir!
[138:58.48]If you come from a fork, you'll be sorely disappointed.
[139:03.32]Okay, I can't go in there apparently.
[139:04.78]He's blocking the way.
[139:05.76]I have his arm.
[139:15.19]Okay, can I touch that?
[139:20.50]I'm opening this with my bare hands.
[139:25.79]What?
[139:26.85]I can't open it?
[139:31.96]Open it, dude!
[139:32.96]You were halfway there!
[139:33.84]What about this... electrical panel?
[139:52.66]Move it down here.
[139:58.53]Is it gonna fall, this thing?
[140:01.89]Alright, should I just reset the game?
[140:03.41]Because I have to, the credits are on the stream right now.
[140:06.50]And I can't even, I can't see anything.
[140:09.78]If you've come from a fork, you'll be sorely disappointed.
[140:20.90]Okay, alright, I'm gonna reset the game.
[140:23.00]I'm gonna reset the game, and we're gonna start over.
[140:25.07]Um, no I'm not, I just hit escape and the credits are over.
[140:38.09]Okay, so what do I do?
[140:44.07]I need to... Okay, so I gotta walk through over here.
[140:47.64]Somebody said you need to drop the meat on the ground.
[140:50.56]Do I have an inventory?
[140:58.73]Did I eat the meat already?
[141:04.22]R is your inventory?
[141:11.53]Dude, R is run the credits!
[141:14.30]Why would you tell me to do that?
[141:17.86]Are you- what?
[141:19.13]Why is that a button?
[141:23.59]Okay, did I- I think I ate the meat already.
[141:27.32]Meat was on your cell on the ground.
[141:38.45]Where the hell even is my cell?
[141:44.54]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[141:46.71]I'm in my cell.
[141:49.03]I ate the meat, guys.
[141:50.07]It's gone.
[141:50.51]I ate it.
[141:52.09]I put it in my bunk bed.
[141:53.98]But it's gone.
[141:54.66]I ate it.
[141:55.06]This is not your cell?
[142:07.27]Where the hell's my cell?
[142:17.30]It's on the floor.
[142:18.42]Dude, I got so turned around.
[142:19.68]I don't even know what way is left or which way is right.
[142:23.63]This game is incredible though.
[142:25.01]We're playing this for at least another hour.
[142:37.49]I think that was my cell.
[142:41.88]Yeah, it definitely was.
[142:45.04]Yeah, this is definitely my cell, because I don't see anything in here.
[142:52.41]No.
[142:56.23]I wonder if I have an inventory.
[142:59.40]I for inventory?
[143:02.38]Oh shit, there it is!
[143:03.62]I got the meat!
[143:04.98]Alright, I got the meat, I'm good.
[143:06.64]Let's go.
[143:08.95]Perfect, awesome.
[143:15.58]Uh-oh.
[143:17.68]Okay.
[143:20.77]Dude, you definitely can do it.
[143:22.95]You're going to be fine.
[143:27.69]Uh-huh.
[143:28.57]Okay.
[143:29.35]Great.
[143:30.44]If you could just put that meat into the... We're going to go ahead and restart the whole game.
[143:43.33]Okay.
[143:43.45]Okay.
[143:46.31]We're just going to restart the game.
[143:49.70]From scratch.
[143:50.90]We're just going to reopen it.
[143:53.21]Pretend that the last 15 minutes did not happen.
[143:58.19]Okay.
[144:03.89]Don't worry.
[144:08.23]That's a crunchy sound effect.
[144:20.13]Okay.
[144:21.51]Here we go.
[144:22.65]I know what I need to do.
[144:24.76]We already know.
[144:26.52]We get grabbed.
[144:27.94]Well, that needs to be lower, doesn't it?
[144:32.69]Okay.
[144:33.61]We're in the bed.
[144:34.34]It's definitely keeping this on easy.
[144:42.03]There's no way I'm going to play this on anything besides easy.
[144:52.60]What's with the NPC wallpaper?
[144:54.46]I don't know, dude.
[144:56.18]I got Bing wallpaper.
[144:57.29]It changes every four hours.
[145:13.17]Okay.
[145:16.06]Yes, I won't.
[145:18.70]That's blocked.
[145:46.38]Okay.
[145:49.76]Pick up the turkey leg.
[145:53.97]If that explosion killed me, I would have been really upset.
[145:57.73]Okay, here we go.
[145:59.59]Outside.
[146:01.58]This guy's right here.
[146:03.30]Let's go.
[146:03.72]Ready?
[146:06.06]If you've come for the fork, you'll be sorely disappointed.
[146:09.55]Okay.
[146:10.57]Come get the meat.
[146:12.99]They look good.
[146:22.32]Does he not want it?
[146:33.07]Here.
[146:33.95]What's up, dude?
[146:51.58]Oh my God.
[146:54.45]Hey, hold on.
[146:56.79]I gotta get the meat.
[146:59.05]I need the meat.
[146:59.81]No, put this down.
[147:03.96]I'm kicking this guy's ass.
[147:04.82]I don't give a shit anymore.
[147:06.74]That meat's mine.
[147:09.95]Okay, are we good?
[147:21.08]Are you gonna- are you gonna behave?
[147:29.77]Alright, now put- What did I just pick up?
[147:35.64]No, go in my inventory.
[147:36.66]I need to drop the meat on the ground.
[147:37.82]I want to be this guy's friend.
[147:41.03]Here.
[147:44.99]Okay.
[147:45.11]Oh, I got the fork.
[147:46.21]Meat.
[147:47.09]Take it.
[147:48.13]Here, look.
[147:49.10]You can have this.
[147:50.49]Look!
[147:56.31]Pick it up, dude!
[147:57.27]I thought it was a cutscene!
[148:01.76]Oh my... I pattern my life after the random looping of your entrails.
[148:23.42]Oh, it's because I picked up the fork.
[148:28.44]Grabbing the fork makes him hostile.
[148:31.29]Oh, shit.
[148:31.97]I didn't even save the game.
[148:33.77]How do I save the game?
[148:44.55]I don't want to save it.
[148:45.23]Okay, I don't want to save it here.
[148:46.23]I have to restart the game again.
[148:50.56]It's okay.
[148:54.18]It's fine.
[148:54.76]It's fine.
[148:57.12]It's alright.
[148:57.77]It's alright.
[148:58.09]I know exactly what to do now.
[149:02.77]S for save, L for load.
[149:04.46]Oh, that's so easy.
[149:05.38]I'm so glad it's that simple.
[149:09.37]Crunchy sounds.
[149:09.95]Be careful.
[149:19.90]Okay.
[149:20.16]S.
[149:29.57]S. Dude, did you guys ever play the arm wrestling arcade game?
[149:38.36]The one that you had to actually... It was a big arm sticking out of the cabinet.
[149:43.00]And it was different tiers of how hard it was for you to pull the thing down.
[149:48.14]That guy sounded like the robot at the end that goes, No way.
[149:52.73]No way.
[149:54.47]When you beat him.
[149:55.53]It's awesome.
[149:57.79]Alright, here we go.
[150:00.45]I got it this time, for sure.
[150:08.10]The combat's actually kind of fun, I'm not gonna lie.
[150:29.17]I'm gonna save right when this is dead.
[150:36.84]Control 9 is kick.
[150:48.05]Alright, let's save it.
[150:52.98]I have to caption?
[151:00.56]Good.
[151:03.02]Alright, we're good.
[151:09.67]I'm ready.
[151:10.97]Not gonna take damage from this, it's very easy to avoid.
[151:12.93]This guy goes, oh don't take my fork!
[151:24.03]Look what I got.
[151:34.75]We cool?
[151:39.33]Okay, I think we're cool.
[151:40.61]But now what else is in his room?
[151:42.09]David.
[151:47.64]I don't need to caption every time.
[151:48.84]Good.
[151:52.22]Alright, so what is this?
[151:53.05]The fork makes him really mad.
[151:56.53]A photograph?
[151:57.29]Alright, I gotta get this queued up so I can run out of here.
[152:01.69]Do I kick his ass?
[152:05.04]Printed 2D reproduction of 3D recorded visual image, subject human female, approximately 21 years old, identity unknown.
[152:13.83]Okay, let's store that.
[152:15.93]I'm going to get it and I'm going to go for it.
[152:24.36]How do I put it away?
[152:32.53]Ready.
[152:34.37]How do I put it away?
[152:42.06]Not R. Oh!
[152:45.65]Oh my god!
[152:47.55]No!
[152:51.11]What if I need this later?
[153:03.31]This guy's slow, whatever.
[153:05.75]Alright, I got the fork.
[153:07.43]He's not going to come out to get me.
[153:09.67]Can I use it in here?
[153:11.97]I'm going to try using the fork in this thing.
[153:17.74]There we go.
[153:18.56]There we go.
[153:20.36]Oh.
[153:25.93]Uh.
[153:27.81]Um.
[153:30.11]Okay.
[153:33.58]Yo!
[153:37.24]First try.
[153:44.45]Oh, if you have an item, it'll put it in your inventory.
[153:46.15]Press I. Okay.
[153:50.36]I'm going to take his arm.
[153:51.74]I want to take all this stuff.
[153:52.66]I'm going to need it for sure.
[153:59.71]Can I not put it away?
[154:02.86]I guess this is not an item, it's probably a weapon.
[154:04.80]Okay, well, whatever.
[154:06.20]I'll leave it.
[154:06.88]I do want the photograph.
[154:17.85]Where is it?
[154:18.25]Give it to me.
[154:19.09]A photograph.
[154:20.77]We're good?
[154:21.35]Okay.
[154:21.69]Get out.
[154:28.46]Return the fork, or I'll command it to destroy you!
[154:32.30]Shut up!
[154:38.43]Progress.
[154:39.17]Let's move.
[154:45.50]Okay.
[154:45.62]I'm gonna take the arm.
[154:51.55]So now can I get out?
[154:55.13]There we go.
[154:56.62]Hell yeah.
[155:02.31]Apparently I breached this.
[155:03.39]Oh god.
[155:10.83]Oh!
[155:22.46]Power?
[155:27.03]Did I turn off the power?
[155:35.64]Oh wait, they're looking at me now!
[155:41.54]Shit, hold on.
[155:44.91]What do I press?
[155:46.23]What should I press?
[155:47.57]Automatic.
[155:48.01]Manual.
[155:51.49]Oh!
[155:56.92]I'm controlling the robot.
[155:57.86]Uh, okay.
[156:06.09]Can I get the thing on the ground?
[156:12.24]Who's talking to me?
[156:19.81]What about this computer?
[156:26.79]Oh no, I fucking blew it.
[156:32.86]Oh, did I try to use his hand?
[156:36.52]Oh, that would have been so cool.
[156:42.83]That's not what I do.
[156:43.91]What about my hand?
[156:50.09]That doesn't fit.
[156:52.02]Um, okay.
[156:54.40]A severed arm.
[156:56.82]What about up here?
[157:04.75]SpongeBob close-up.
[157:06.27]It really was.
[157:06.79]Prisoner information.
[157:11.44]Um... Inject legs with lubricant twice a day.

[158:04.96]So, the computer here... I could control a little robot.
[158:39.94]Is he done?
[158:44.57]Oh, I picked up something.
[158:47.86]Maybe do I put this in the thing back here?
[159:05.24]Oh, dude, I think I actually do that.
[159:07.81]Should I bring this out?
[159:10.19]Hold on.
[159:22.65]Extend the arm through the gate, maybe.
[159:26.73]Let's try it.
[159:40.91]Okay.
[159:49.37]Other computer.
[159:58.33]Maintenance.
[160:01.52]Emergency Procedure Fusion Reactor.
[160:03.72]Status Emergency.
[160:05.34]Class 3 reactor alert in effect.
[160:07.73]All personnel must obtain a hard suit and proceed in an orderly fashion out to the landing platform.
[160:13.75]All non-essential personnel have been evacuated to the Chileos.
[160:18.80]Designated dropship Z or 2.
[160:23.08]Okay.
[160:24.29]All main systems switch to full automatic, self-diagnostic, and self-regulatory.
[160:33.43]Independent forklift bot in control room still operating on internal power supply.
[160:40.28]OK.
[160:49.91]Oh, data log.
[160:55.26]It's like a map.
[160:58.83]Repair.
[161:00.71]Oh.
[161:05.07]System damage short and force bar system cell 1.
[161:09.21]I think it just repaired something.
[161:17.77]Damage short and bar 2.
[161:22.25]Oh dude, I'm repairing a lot of stuff.
[161:30.44]Okay, did that do anything?
[161:35.75]There's another computer right here though.
[161:42.40]Security.
[161:47.56]Everyone's dead.
[162:01.01]Oh, progress.
[162:10.49]Oh, force bars.
[162:11.45]Okay, this is a turn.
[162:12.43]I'm going to turn all the force.
[162:13.93]Wait, then won't that guy come out to kill me?
[162:16.00]Alright, I'll kick his ass.
[162:22.05]I'll save it right before he gets here.
[162:28.60]Oh, this is the bot.
[162:29.96]OK.
[162:31.30]So I can have the bot come out.
[162:33.30]And give me the item.
[162:46.02]Is this from GOG?
[162:46.70]This is on GOG.
[162:50.48]Who is that?
[162:52.22]Alright, new character.
[162:53.80]Wait, I can't turn this on.
[162:56.52]Access denied OK.
[163:08.09]Maybe I shouldn't open his, but you know what?
[163:10.63]I'm just gonna do it for fun.
[163:20.53]Okay, let's go see what I did.
[163:26.96]Now, should I just control him?
[163:31.33]I can have him come out now.
[163:40.24]This is goofy.
[163:41.12]Okay, so where should I go?
[163:43.80]Uh, this is cell four.
[163:52.44]Should I go fuck with the guy over here?
[164:02.17]This game is a 12 hour game.
[164:05.18]Oh, that's awesome.
[164:14.53]What is that phenomenon where you're just like, holy smokes, I thought I was in the right spot, but I just wasn't at all?
[164:25.92]I couldn't do this one.
[164:40.73]Why am I pranking this guy?
[164:57.34]Can I not go in?
[165:03.03]I can't even go in here.
[165:10.34]Alright, I'm just going to go see him.
[165:15.17]I'm just going to go hang out with this guy right now.
[165:25.60]Alright, come here.
[165:31.05]What does he got in his hand?
[165:32.01]Doesn't he have that thing in his hand?
[165:36.78]Maybe we should put it down.
[165:37.90]There was something else in the cell, though.
[165:43.89]Oh, wrong one.
[165:50.08]Okay, what is this?
[165:55.40]I know, but is that something else on the ground?
[166:06.64]It's rooted.
[166:15.45]Put the flute on?
[166:27.03]Oh, apparently, okay, hold on.
[166:28.59]This is, I guess this is kind of convoluted.
[166:31.99]I have to drop the blue arm on the ground where you can see it from the cameras.
[166:38.54]Then I have to drive the nurse bot to pick up the blue arm.
[166:43.87]Go to one of the monitors that has access as one of its options and input Mr. Blue's security code.
[166:52.32]Then, okay, hold on.
[166:54.49]I need to keep this.
[166:58.36]I'm sticking with this one until I get out of this room.
[167:00.37]You know what I mean?
[167:01.07]Like, we need to stick with this.
[167:04.09]I'm with this one for a little bit longer.
[167:06.98]It started way too chaotically.
[167:10.44]It blew all of our dopamine.
[167:12.09]You know what I mean?
[167:12.61]Like, let's just give it a minute.
[167:22.80]Oh, where's... Where's this other... Oh, there it is.
[167:31.29]Was there nothing else in here?
[167:36.53]Didn't he pick something up?
[167:37.73]I feel like... Okay, yeah.
[167:39.66]I thought this was part of the grate.
[167:41.08]Can I play this?
[167:46.96]This game is far too weird to get out of it now.
[167:51.43]Okay.
[167:53.77]Apparently... Let's see.
[167:56.09]Dane's Logbook.
[167:59.42]uh-huh yep yep yep power surge the admission of data yeah okay power okay singularity uh a rescue alright that course that's great confirmation
[168:27.95]History.
[168:29.90]First drop ship.
[168:33.56]Several hours.
[168:34.24]Sad set.
[168:37.53]Three of the men directly disobeyed my order.
[168:44.46]Months be commissioned.
[168:47.26]Leader.
[168:52.21]Say Dallas.
[168:58.33]Uh-huh.
[169:00.43]Obviously.
[169:01.01]Spying.
[169:03.02]Be some use to them.
[169:08.92]Impossible.
[169:10.73]Burying times.
[169:11.73]Suitable.
[169:15.44]Paralyzed with agony.
[169:17.30]Hallucinations.
[169:17.94]Strange.
[169:19.96]I feel like I'm doing slam poetry.
[169:28.00]There's 11 entries.
[169:29.88]Okay, I need to... Apparently I'm looking for the security code.
[169:40.36]Dude, where's the security code?
[169:49.85]I saw it.
[169:50.19]It was go back, go back.
[169:51.11]I saw it.
[169:51.66]It's long.
[169:52.22]It's... Wait, wait, wait.
[169:53.06]Where'd you see it?
[170:03.58]Oh shit!
[170:04.31]There it is!
[170:05.09]My personal access code number is 07364.
[170:07.55]Hey, at least you gotta read it, right?
[170:13.86]We got it.
[170:15.58]07364.
[170:16.86]Okay.
[170:19.71]Bingo.
[170:26.95]Put it down.
[170:30.10]Get the arm.
[170:32.06]Now back where I can see the cameras.
[170:38.11]I hope I'm not on a time limit for this.
[170:39.55]Now I gotta make it so I can see it on the camera.
[170:46.32]Okay, I can definitely see it in here, so I'm gonna leave it here.
[170:48.28]Oh, I can just leave it with the bot.
[171:02.32]What am I doing?
[171:06.04]The guide is saying the game is incredibly unforgiving with leaving behind items.
[171:11.24]And it's a lot of reading.
[171:13.09]But they think it's worth it.
[171:18.81]I love that.
[171:22.22]Alright, give me this.
[171:23.74]Make sure I don't softlock myself.
[171:26.20]Look, do I need to figure this out on my own?
[171:28.80]No.
[171:30.61]No, I could give a rat's ass.
[171:32.33]I want to see the fun, cool stuff.
[171:36.23]OK, I'm ready.
[171:41.07]Now.
[171:47.44]Go to the monitor that has access as one of the options.
[171:51.99]Which one was that?
[171:55.23]Not this one.
[171:56.51]I think it's one of the ones down here.
[172:00.63]This game is wonderful though.
[172:01.95]I love it.
[172:03.57]We've had two bangers back to back.
[172:05.15]That's great.
[172:06.06]I'm very happy.
[172:08.60]Okay, no.
[172:11.38]Let me pick this thing up though, alright?
[172:17.75]What happened to the other item the robot picked up?
[172:28.40]Okay, got it.
[172:37.57]OK.
[172:39.37]Now I have to with the bot has it in its hand.
[172:44.96]Now.
[172:47.05]Access.
[172:48.79]Security access this is what was it 07.
[172:51.79]361.
[172:54.44]Oh that one guy got it wrong.
[173:03.17]0-3... 0-7-3-6-4.
[173:10.36]No palm detected against reader.
[173:14.00]What did that say?
[173:20.05]Okay, now... Have the nurse bot drop the blue arm.
[173:33.05]So I did this right.
[173:36.46]I actually did this right.
[173:38.60]I went to very... I got the SpongeBob close-up and I just did it in the wrong order.
[173:52.37]Wait, should I just bring... I'm going to have him come over to me.
[174:19.09]Okay, now put the arm on it, right?
[174:27.56]Look at how helpful he is.
[174:28.47]Okay.
[174:37.70]Now... Get in front of it.
[174:42.49]And then what should I do?
[174:43.13]The injection button?
[174:49.75]Oh, he put it down.
[175:12.69]Leave it parked there until you enter the code.
[175:15.27]Oh, okay.
[175:19.43]Now he can't pick it up.
[175:25.54]Come on, dude.
[175:26.10]You just picked it.
[175:26.64]You just had it in your hand.
[175:29.89]You're driving me crazy with this.
[175:37.10]Okay.
[175:38.72]Now he's over there.
[175:39.56]Let's try that code again.
[175:42.75]I saw somebody just say, oh man, this game.
[175:46.19]It's been wild so far.
[175:48.54]Okay.
[175:54.65]Pamela, open door is insufficient.
[175:55.91]Wait on floor panel to open door.
[175:57.82]Ooh.
[176:00.58]Okay.
[176:02.28]Now drop the arm.
[176:19.48]Let that go.
[176:22.39]Then I pick up the arm and it should work.
[176:26.11]I'm saving the game, by the way.
[176:27.37]This is way too much bullshit.
[176:31.77]Good.
[176:32.79]Okay.
[176:40.54]Still in the way?
[176:43.26]Here we go.
[176:49.51]Yeah!
[176:50.41]We did it!
[176:51.79]Let's go!
[176:55.37]Should I take this?
[176:56.01]Should I keep it with me?
[177:07.46]Uh, I hear... Oh, there's a tank in here.
[177:13.51]Is it... Oh my god!
[177:18.22]It's the thing from Robocop!
[177:19.68]I can't move!
[177:21.08]He's fucking shredding me!
[177:24.66]What the hell?
[177:33.76]Well... Leave the arm on the floor from this point, so when you return you can put it back.
[177:49.26]And you can open it.
[177:49.96]Oh, okay.
[177:55.80]Use multiple save slots, you're gonna get softlocked.
[178:03.75]Alright, so leave it here.
[178:04.67]Leave it on the ground inside of here, right?
[178:07.53]Alright, now I gotta run by this.
[178:08.41]Oh my god.
[178:16.44]I don't know how to... Do you have to hide?
[178:23.52]What are you supposed to do?
[178:30.19]I probably have to hide.
[178:31.34]Okay, I guess I just have to not die?
[178:53.97]Uh oh.
[179:00.67]Okay.
[179:00.79]I wanna get like a snack or something.
[179:03.52]I might get a handful of sunflower seeds.
[179:05.80]I got a break coming up here anyways.
[179:13.39]Okay.
[179:13.51]Update the save.
[179:14.87]Don't be lazy about it.
[179:20.66]Good.
[179:22.34]Okay, leave it here.
[179:24.98]This game is so ass with a broken heart.
[179:29.87]I disagree.
[179:34.21]Dude, I thought I could outrun it.
[179:44.82]This is so fucked up.
[179:48.49]The second you hit the ground, you're dead.
[179:51.39]It's GG.
[179:57.38]Maybe I have to strafe around?
[179:59.00]I'm gonna try strafing.
[180:14.50]Oh, get out of here, dude!
[180:22.31]Yeah!
[180:23.11]Yeah.
[180:24.65]What's this?
[180:30.19]I gotta save that.
[180:32.16]And I'm getting some sunflower seeds.
[180:38.19]Alright, I'll be back.
[186:12.01]I keep laughing about the credits thing.
[186:17.97]I kind of was walking back into the room and I just hurt myself laughing about it.
[186:24.84]There's a dedicated button for the entire credits to play at any point in the entire game.
[186:31.51]That is so wonderful.
[186:34.89]What a great addition.
[186:36.90]I'm so happy it's there.
[186:43.45]OK, let's keep going.
[186:47.39]So I saved it.
[186:51.03]What's in this room?
[186:51.66]Let's take an assessment.
[186:57.92]Wheel.
[187:01.35]You just run the credits and just say you beat the game.
[187:05.19]There's something over here.
[187:09.88]Looks like these pods.
[187:16.69]What is this for?
[187:24.08]Cryogenic system.
[187:25.89]Chamber one.
[187:28.17]Heart rate.
[187:28.53]There's somebody in there.
[187:31.74]Species prototype.
[187:34.38]Cyber raptor.
[187:37.09]Can we let him out?
[187:46.86]Is that a code?
[187:51.57]I kinda wanna release it.
[188:14.92]Uh, biologist is the recipient of numerous brain implants.
[188:19.05]Tissue-type tests suggested he would be compatible with cybernetics.
[188:25.66]Okay.
[188:27.16]How about three?
[188:29.44]Uh-oh.
[188:32.34]Game for three is not doing so well.
[188:37.29]Daedalus sapien.
[188:39.65]A carrion eater.
[188:44.20]I love four.
[188:45.62]An insectoid creature.
[188:51.61]I want to see.
[188:52.11]I want to visit them.
[189:06.69]Okay.
[189:09.33]So can I enter, oh.
[189:12.52]Open the hatch.
[189:17.45]Did I say that?
[189:21.64]Oh, here we go.
[189:38.96]I was trying to go down the ladder.
[189:42.49]What is even in there?
[189:54.58]I want to go down there.
[190:00.15]You fell into the hot chili.
[190:01.67]Yeah, that was... What was that?
[190:04.14]It was like the goo from Ghostbusters 2.
[190:07.45]Okay, you're gonna actually go down?
[190:20.55]Ooh.
[190:37.89]Oh my God, dude, just go.
[190:47.24]This is so long.
[190:54.99]I feel like I'm getting trapped.
[190:55.95]Somebody invaded me in Dark Souls and is doing that to me on the ladder.
[190:59.69]The only difference is I haven't kicked like three times.
[191:03.66]I haven't punched three times.
[191:08.25]Oh my god, you can fall off here.
[191:09.97]What am I?
[191:10.75]No, I'm fine.
[191:11.81]I'm right in the middle.
[191:15.52]Take it easy.
[191:16.14]Slow.
[191:29.69]Dude.
[191:29.93]You hear breathing?
[191:35.88]Somebody watching me from that little thing?
[191:58.55]Was that my body?
[192:00.15]That was... What the hell was that?
[192:04.10]What?
[192:04.42]Okay, so don't go down?
[192:10.31]Or don't walk past the bridge?
[192:17.60]He threw me like a dog toy.
[192:19.82]Okay.
[192:27.98]Wait, hold on, I can do this.
[192:40.68]Ooh, there we go.
[192:43.94]Critical.
[192:46.18]Situation critical.
[192:49.75]Right here, right?
[192:56.88]How do I stabilize?
[193:02.41]What do I do?
[193:05.23]How do I stabilize?
[193:10.66]Oh, shit.
[193:12.95]Oh, fuck.
[193:13.43]It's a Tyrannosaurus, correct?
[193:16.57]Into the hole.
[193:20.96]Into the hole, right?
[193:24.67]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[193:25.29]Don't.
[193:25.63]I don't want to fall in.
[193:26.51]You fall in the hole.
[193:31.11]Can you go in?
[193:31.67]I don't even know where my character is.
[193:39.26]Don't even come on man.
[193:50.17]Alright, let's go.
[193:59.48]There's puke on him.
[194:10.58]This thing kind of sucks.
[194:12.47]This is as aggressive as a golden retriever.
[194:27.07]I don't think he even wants to fight.
[194:28.17]Should I not fight him?
[194:30.57]Oh.
[194:39.27]Uh-oh, I think I killed him.
[194:56.67]Wait, no?
[194:59.78]Okay.
[195:17.90]Oh, he's going down.
[195:18.64]He's going down.
[195:19.22]Okay.
[195:19.98]So let me check the body.
[195:21.92]No, he's not.
[195:22.90]Is he?
[195:25.74]He is not very scary.
[195:31.79]Make it fall down?
[195:32.75]Oh, will he dive?
[195:34.55]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[195:35.45]Hold on.
[195:36.05]Let me see.
[195:41.86]Okay.
[195:42.00]Yep.
[195:42.54]I get it.
[195:44.12]Make it fall down.
[195:45.18]Make it dive into the thing.
[195:49.44]Wait, turn off the toothpaste?
[195:53.70]Do not fall down.
[196:08.82]This is gonna work, right?
[196:09.84]Yeah, it is.
[196:14.53]What?
[196:16.03]Oh, I gotta knock him out on it.
[196:18.28]That's gonna be easy.
[196:19.14]This thing sucks.
[196:28.23]Ooh, scary!
[196:37.44]Alright, when does he fall?
[196:45.93]Leave him alone?
[196:49.34]He's going down.
[196:49.88]He's going down.
[196:50.32]He's going down.
[196:50.66]He's going down.
[196:53.63]Oh, he's going down.

[197:07.29]If you're going to fall, fall over here.

[197:49.54]Oh no.
[197:53.86]What is coming back up?

[198:47.25]Oh, man, we got to fight the raptor again.
[198:49.53]He was okay.
[198:50.65]I know what to do.
[198:53.02]Alright, here we go.
[199:13.54]Yep.
[199:15.34]Okay.
[199:21.51]Not doing well.
[199:35.08]Oh my god!
[199:36.30]It's a raptor!
[199:39.34]It's a raptor!
[199:43.32]What do I do?
[199:45.35]Oh no, what do I do?
[199:49.98]Oh no.
[199:51.09]Oh shit.
[199:52.47]Okay, I guess I'll find it.
[199:53.03]I have to find it, I think.
[199:54.72]How does this stop?
[199:56.06]When I fight this, it's so dangerous.
[200:13.78]Okay.
[200:15.99]We want him to fall right here.
[200:16.91]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[200:20.71]This way.
[200:21.88]No.
[200:24.68]No, no, no, no.
[200:25.66]Turn around.
[200:38.62]Then dump him.
[200:49.71]Did I do it?
[201:17.79]Is that it?
[201:25.97]Is it safe to go down here now?
[201:37.59]I flushed them both, so it should be safe technically, right?
[201:46.94]What on Earth?
[201:50.84]Whoa.
[201:54.27]That's cool.
[202:00.15]I hope they don't unfreeze from this.
[202:13.69]Did he say anything about it?
[202:19.96]I guess I can't... There's no items on the ground, right?
[202:38.37]of what's back here.
[202:48.30]Okay, hold on.
[202:49.20]Save it.
[202:51.22]Also, it's a little loud, isn't it?
[202:53.70]Turn it down a little bit.
[203:05.77]I'm gonna say left.
[203:13.08]It wasn't left.
[203:13.78]It was the wrong way, I guess.
[203:18.03]I'm glad I saved it right there.
[203:19.37]That would have been awful if I didn't.
[203:21.17]I would have to go down the... What?
[203:22.79]Why?
[203:27.80]Okay, what about right?
[203:29.46]Is it also a fall down to death?
[203:31.59]I don't think I can even go... Can I go forward?
[203:43.91]So we go back up and there's something else to do up top.
[204:05.51]Can I go right?
[204:08.80]Probably right.
[204:10.20]I can't get up there.
[204:12.20]Do I need to jump up there or something?
[204:18.27]There's a jump?
[204:22.63]You have to jump.
[204:23.76]Press R to jump.
[204:30.39]Right.
[204:31.49]What is jump?
[204:42.06]There's been a jump for the last hour and a half.
[204:44.93]I didn't even know it was there.
[204:55.76]Numpad 5.
[204:57.35]Oh no, don't tell me that's accurate.
[205:02.90]It has to be the right spot.
[205:03.98]It's spacebar.
[205:10.18]That is the most bizarre fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.
[205:15.60]I never would have guessed that.
[205:17.15]Ever.
[205:20.85]Hi.
[205:21.71]Who are you?
[205:22.78]What have you done to me?
[205:24.40]I want answers.
[205:26.90]Freeze, prisoner!
[205:29.97]What?
[205:31.29]I- Let's get you back to your cage, animal.
[205:35.79]Come on, dude.
[205:37.89]What have you done to me?
[205:39.15]Tell me, damn you.
[205:41.50]What have you done?
[205:44.42]Who are you?
[205:45.22]What have you done to me?
[205:46.84]I want answers.
[205:48.96]Take him in the hole.
[205:50.36]What have you done to me?
[205:51.62]Tell me, damn you.
[205:55.87]Oh, I just headbutt him.
[205:58.51]Knocked out.
[205:59.07]You have stolen my body and my mind.
[206:02.99]I will know why, or I will have your blood.
[206:06.32]I already had the blood, didn't I?
[206:10.76]What you got on you?
[206:11.52]A blaster.
[206:12.56]A blaster.
[206:15.79]A blaster.
[206:17.97]We got a gun now, everybody.
[206:21.69]We'll make that very perfectly clear.
[206:36.15]How do I shoot it?
[206:39.12]Control 5?
[206:40.02]Uh oh.
[206:50.80]I don't have a numpad.
[207:00.05]I thought I was dead!
[207:09.57]I can't.
[207:10.01]I don't think I can fire the gun.
[207:13.51]I OK, I'm going to plug another keyboard in guys.
[207:17.03]I do have an I do have an Amazon Basics keyboard.
[207:21.62]This thing is fucking filthy by the way.
[207:27.49]Do control 5.
[207:29.57]Alt and number 5.
[207:34.25]Alt and number 5.
[207:37.78]No, that's not working.
[207:44.46]Control 5.
[207:46.47]No.
[207:51.55]I guess I could just, I could plug in this.
[207:53.31]This has a number pad.
[207:54.49]Reload it with R. Give me a second.
[208:02.92]Let me plug this in.
[208:06.61]Let me plug this long ass keyboard in.
[208:11.93]Can you have two keyboards plugged in at the same time?
[208:15.23]You don't need the numpad, it should just be 5.
[208:17.11]Nah, 5 doesn't do anything.
[208:24.48]Combat mode?
[208:25.04]5.
[208:26.74]Alt 5.
[208:27.81]Control 5.
[208:28.37]5.
[208:28.95]Here, just watch this for a few minutes.
[208:32.99]Give me a sec.
[208:40.12]You're gonna crash your computer or what?
[209:09.41]I just bumped my head on the mic.
[209:23.05]OK, so let me move this out of the way.
[209:33.43]OK, so numpad.
[209:38.88]So you're saying that I do numpad?
[209:46.34]Numpad 5.
[209:49.17]Dude, we are in business.
[209:53.31]Everything else works the same, right?
[210:07.25]This has ammo?
[210:17.27]Unlimited ammo.
[210:18.69]Oh hell yeah.
[210:20.95]I'm going to light somebody up.
[210:27.80]I gotta get the right spot again because there was something else up there.
[210:40.52]OK, I got a blaster.
[210:42.03]What else is up here?
[210:46.90]I did try to shoot the guy.
[210:48.20]I'm not.
[210:48.54]I'm gonna lie.
[210:52.09]Nothing else.
[211:00.83]OK, I guess that now that's it, so I guess I have to go back up now.
[211:05.32]I'm doing the cool shit that I did before.
[211:15.60]Well, it wasn't as cool this time.
[211:18.05]Oh, save.
[211:31.66]Yep.
[211:32.20]Good call.
[211:43.65]The shots ricochet?
[211:52.19]Bounce back and hit me in the face.
[211:53.39]That would have been insane.
[212:00.78]This is a great shot right here.
[212:02.24]This is a wonderful angle.
[212:17.20]Okay, back up.
[212:21.38]And we'll see where we go now.
[212:39.88]This takes forever.
[212:47.84]Okay, I have a gun.
[212:49.12]I can turn around now.
[212:51.75]I probably can use the gun somewhere.
[212:53.73]I thought I fell down.
[212:54.49]I was like, what?
[212:57.48]Okay, gun time.
[213:05.07]Give it another save.
[213:12.00]It's a new keyboard.
[213:12.70]Give me a break.
[213:14.54]Well, it's an old keyboard.
[213:20.41]Wait a minute, can I fight the robot out here now?
[213:21.99]I'm gonna fight the bot that's out here.
[213:23.51]I'm gonna kick his ass.
[213:26.14]What's up, buddy?
[213:46.40]It's no fair, he bought the premium skin.
[214:00.22]Maybe I can't kill it.
[214:01.76]I'm gonna try again.
[214:16.78]Get over here, come on.
[214:21.97]Where is he?
[214:30.93]Okay, you know what?
[214:32.95]It's the full motion video motion cap fall down that gets me every time.
[214:44.35]I bet I actually have to kill this right now though.
[214:51.32]Hold on, I have an idea.
[214:54.02]He's probably too big to come in this room.
[214:55.68]So here's what I'm going to do.
[214:57.36]Let's aggro him.
[215:02.77]And then we're going to get him stuck in here.
[215:11.24]Coming?
[215:26.06]No, I want to be in there.
[215:27.94]No, stop it!
[215:31.73]Stop!
[215:39.43]Here he comes.
[215:49.84]He's right here.
[216:00.08]Where'd he go?
[216:22.39]Here he comes.
[216:43.82]What?
[216:44.20]Why did it take so long?
[216:50.21]What am I hitting with this?
[217:04.98]Go!
[217:05.20]Come on, dude!
[217:08.41]I was trying to... Wait, he did say do not move.
[217:28.12]What if I just don't move?
[217:32.24]True, hold on.
[217:48.79]Do not move or you will be shot.
[217:51.05]I am moving.
[217:51.89]Unit 11 to security.
[217:54.36]Apprehended escaped prisoner in security level corridor.
[217:58.88]Please respond.
[218:02.07]Need further instructions.
[218:03.55]Okay.
[218:05.21]Unit 11 to security.
[218:07.79]Apprehended escaped prisoner in security level corridor.
[218:12.32]Please respond.
[218:23.54]What was I supposed to do there?
[218:25.26]Where am I going to go?
[218:30.69]Okay.
[218:31.21]I'm trying this one more time and I'm just going to run by him.
[218:33.53]I think I can get the kill though.
[218:34.89]I really do.
[218:35.31]He might have something cool on him.
[218:39.00]Watch this.
[218:39.68]If I could just get the Resident Evil camera to operate the way that I want it to.
[218:44.17]Watch this.
[218:44.49]Ready?
[218:45.97]And he'd be going the right way.
[218:50.34]He's going to come up to me and...
[219:16.05]Eat shit, buddy.
[219:17.90]There's one for the road.
[219:24.33]Oh!
[219:26.47]Wait.
[219:35.91]Just leave.
[219:39.90]I don't know.
[219:41.10]Where do I want to go?
[219:41.68]All the way up?
[219:43.30]Where the hell do I want to go?
[219:44.32]Shoot him!
[220:07.94]I gotta go to a different floor.
[220:09.14]Different floor.
[220:09.55]Different floor.
[220:10.41]Wrong floor.
[220:14.35]Sorry.
[220:15.36]See you later.
[220:18.98]Bye.
[220:19.76]Cool.
[220:20.10]Alright, what's out here?
[220:32.38]This is the floor I was on.
[220:33.92]That's the floor I was on.
[220:35.84]I was on two.
[220:36.63]I was on number two.
[220:38.65]I'm leaving.
[220:39.61]Don't even worry.
[220:40.63]That is the wrong... I don't want to be on the... I want to be on this one.
[220:45.54]Please secure all sidearms.
[220:48.63]Energy discharges from this chamber are extremely hazardous.
[221:11.44]Uh, what?
[221:14.29]A second door, a second Metal Gear.
[221:33.86]Oh ho ho ho, somebody's using portals!
[221:41.53]That's what I'm talking about, yep.
[221:45.82]Eat like you stupid machine.
[221:50.48]I am not healthy right now.
[221:57.05]Any turkey meat anywhere?
[222:12.97]Great.
[222:15.75]Oh, I guess that means I can go in.
[222:17.63]Any food in here?
[222:21.68]Any sandwiches?
[222:22.60]Sandwiches?
[222:28.89]Uh, that was a gas room.
[222:56.76]Hey, I know what to do here.
[222:58.42]I'm not gonna get hit.
[223:05.39]Check it out.
[223:06.27]Didn't take any damage, that's good.
[223:22.17]Wait, get into diagnostic mode.
[223:24.99]Eat like a stupid machine.
[223:28.52]Oh, that's right.
[223:29.18]I forgot about that.
[223:29.98]I do have a heal.
[223:33.96]Wow.
[223:35.25]I can just heal.
[223:36.81]That's pretty sick.
[223:53.01]Okay, let's go.
[223:56.92]Don't go in this room.
[223:57.56]This is the gas reactor room.
[224:00.82]Oh.
[224:03.03]Maybe I should go fast.
[224:09.67]Super fast.
[224:11.24]Very quickly is how fast I'm going right now.
[224:18.18]I think it's my buddy.
[224:19.85]There you are.
[224:23.55]Come in.
[224:23.73]Wait.
[224:23.85]You have no choice.
[224:25.07]I assure you.
[224:27.80]Is this the guy from the intro?
[224:38.31]Uh... You do not recognize me, but we have already met.
[224:45.62]I am Dr. Mastaf, your maker.
[224:50.21]The music is wonderful.
[224:55.35]I know you have many questions.
[224:58.56]Who are you?
[225:00.77]What have you become?
[225:04.23]Hey, can you please full screen?
[225:06.37]When I run full screen in this game, it goes... I tried a lot of stuff.
[225:12.88]This is the only thing I can really do.
[225:13.92]What are doing these questions will be the death of you.
[225:27.12]Okay, why am I...
[225:28.74]Okay, well, shoot him in the head.
[225:48.92]I guess I could stretch the OBS capture of it, but it'd make it look a little weird.
[225:58.13]I want to know why I can't move.
[226:23.24]I need you for a demonstration.
[226:32.97]Hey!
[226:33.57]I didn't do that!
[226:34.27]Oh no, I'm under his total control.
[226:38.46]I will answer these questions for you now.
[226:44.85]You are an instrument of unimaginable power.
[226:49.40]Accept that reality and revel in your new existence You are the first of the line here is the second okay soon he will join you He will be as you are now
[227:17.93]Oh, he crushed it.
[227:18.75]He crushed the device.
[227:30.61]This is Control 2.
[227:38.99]Chelios and Brody have landed.
[227:41.51]Marines are in the base.
[227:42.01]I repeat, Marines are in the base.
[227:45.11]Helio.
[227:47.53]Alright.
[227:50.56]Where's my gun?
[227:52.30]I don't think I have my gun.
[227:57.98]Can I talk to this guy?
[228:00.32]I'm going to save.
[228:02.03]I'm going to try to full screen it.
[228:04.07]Turn the volume down because it might be awful.
[228:12.76]You guys ready?
[228:14.32]Turn your volume down.
[228:21.27]uh that didn't really help at all that actually made it worse uh so what happened on my screen is it went into full screen but the whole game was in a box this big so it is what it is I think it's fine and I think it adds to the the old school vibe
[228:52.20]Bing wallpaper?
[228:53.28]Yeah, whatever.
[228:53.96]I don't have to think about my wallpaper.
[228:55.88]It just is what it is.
[229:00.61]I wake up in the morning, I turn my computer on, and cool, there's an awesome new wallpaper.
[229:11.60]Did I just turn him off?
[229:14.84]Oh, I got his hard drive.
[229:17.88]Oh, that's disrespectful.
[229:19.23]The battery.
[229:25.04]I stole the dude's battery.
[229:31.22]I still... I still have this.
[229:36.41]Don't worry.

[230:35.19]I'm sorry, I thought I was gonna get to World 8.
[230:39.29]Bullshit.
[230:40.59]Okay, so now what do I do?
[230:44.50]Examine his brain?
[230:50.35]What's this?

[232:09.41]I froze!
[232:11.37]I froze!
[232:12.74]Mission accomplished, everyone.
[232:14.26]The threat has been nullified.
[232:22.09]That guy was so proud of himself, too.
[232:24.81]He was waiting to say, mission accomplished.
[232:31.28]Okay, so run by that guy.
[232:32.92]I don't have a gun anymore.
[232:36.98]I have some guide friends in the mod chat.
[232:41.24]And I've been told that I took the hard route.
[232:44.75]This apparently is the hard route.
[232:48.19]And I am very close to have been softlocked at this point right now.
[232:53.51]Uh... Is it the gamer route?
[232:57.70]Okay, let me just try to run.
[233:00.46]Freeze, prisoner!
[233:02.30]Okay, I actually do freeze.
[233:04.64]Mission accomplished, everyone.
[233:06.14]The threat has been nullified.
[233:09.09]Is this GG?
[233:10.01]Is this over?
[233:18.18]What, we'll play the flute?
[233:25.07]Let me try the flute.
[233:26.67]I'll try it.
[233:41.83]We're told to use multiple saves.
[233:43.17]I have another save.
[233:43.79]...
[234:23.39]Um... Uh-oh.
[234:44.28]This isn't that far.
[234:48.22]This is... We have to kill the dinosaur and then we... This is not that bad.
[234:53.07]You need the third key card.
[234:54.27]Oh, okay.
[234:57.45]Can you just run?
[234:58.38]When he says freeze, I actually don't move.
[235:01.72]He freezes me.
[235:05.94]Shoot him at the door?
[235:06.57]I don't have the gun anymore.
[235:09.89]I am weaponless.
[235:14.82]Maybe I actually am softlocked.
[235:17.12]That's so funny.
[235:19.36]Um, okay.
[235:20.60]Wait, hold on.
[235:32.29]Wait.
[235:32.95]Secure data.
[235:34.01]Medical access.
[235:40.52]Ugh.
[235:41.30]Dammit.
[235:44.56]And the other route you go upstairs and you shoot them down.
[235:48.84]Oh.
[235:52.95]Okay.
[235:53.57]So... Wait.
[235:57.09]What am I doing?
[235:58.15]Wait a minute.
[235:58.81]Wait a minute.
[235:59.53]Wait a minute.
[236:01.28]I don't think I'm bringing them back to life.
[236:03.04]Nope.
[236:03.92]I just axe body sprayed myself.
[236:06.53]I thought I was bringing this person back to life.
[236:16.50]Damn it.
[236:17.02]Alright.
[236:18.33]Alright, here's the deal.
[236:21.41]I want to continue playing this.
[236:23.53]I think this is great.
[236:24.50]I think this game is amazing.
[236:26.38]Um...
[236:27.55]I will go back to the first save.
[236:30.38]Off stream.
[236:31.58]And I will get us back to where we were like 10 to 20 minutes ago.
[236:36.53]And we will continue it tomorrow.
[236:39.13]But.
[236:40.03]We will move on from this.
[236:41.25]I'm going to.
[236:41.77]We'll pick this one back up tomorrow.
[236:42.81]I think there's plenty more to see.
[236:48.88]Because I think it is like about 30 minutes of time.
[236:51.29]Like 30 to 40 minutes maybe.
[236:53.53]I guess if I ran it would be like 10 to 15 minutes.
[236:55.77]But.
[236:58.06]I'd rather just pick it up where we left off.
[237:00.11]This one was amazing though.
[237:01.69]And you'll see it again tomorrow.
[237:03.61]Alright.
[237:04.67]Next.
[237:06.20]I will take a break.
[237:07.80]And we'll come back and we'll do another one.
[237:09.84]Two bangers back to back.
[237:11.46]I'm very happy.
[237:14.09]We're definitely going to do this one again tomorrow.
[237:16.31]So I'll be right back.
[237:17.45]We'll do another game.
[237:19.16]I got one decent save point.
[237:21.32]We will pick back Bioforge up.
[237:26.50]Don't DRAC 3 this game.
[237:29.48]Okay, this is not a Dracula 3 scenario.
[237:37.47]There hasn't been eight word searches.
[237:40.58]So, don't worry.
[237:43.12]Alright, I'll be right back.
[241:29.63]Hello.
[241:32.58]Coming up next, we're going to play a game called Redline.
[241:42.28]Looked kind of crazy.
[241:47.63]I think it's a first-person shooter.
[241:58.72]Turn the volume down just because it could be... Actually, I think it should be fine right here.
[242:04.77]Let me know if it gets too crazy.
[242:06.19]If it's too loud, I can fix it.
[242:13.58]Here we go.
[242:28.95]chess.
[242:32.03]Evil chess.
[242:47.81]Red line.
[242:53.36]Okay, everything should be good.
[242:56.44]When I press New Game, everything should be working very fine.
[243:00.22]Stadium City, New Game.
[243:02.71]Let's go.
[243:04.70]Briefing.
[243:24.38]This is loud music.
[243:25.44]I hope it's not loud for you.
[243:26.61]I can't hear anything he's saying.
[243:54.76]oh that's is that me just make your own interpretation of what's going on I guess
[244:33.86]Damn.
[244:38.84]I wouldn't want to be that guy just standing out there.
[244:57.35]Music change.
[244:57.98]The guitar came in deeper.
[245:02.02]Ladies and gentlemen of Stadium City, my name is Rand of the Red Sixers.
[245:21.11]We have assumed control.
[245:21.61]We'll be going door to door.
[245:22.19]Let's go.
[245:22.39]That's me.
[245:22.61]Anybody has a problem with it, you can discuss it with me here at the radio station.
[245:36.80]Did I just kill the guy that was talking?
[245:45.67]Okay, uh, what?
[245:47.38]You really way too fast.
[245:49.52]I feel like I'm no clipping.
[245:53.64]Wait, oh, enter vehicle.
[245:56.03]How do I go in?
[245:58.93]E?
[245:59.29]No.
[246:00.67]Oh, let's go.
[246:03.32]Oh, that was horrible.
[246:04.66]That was horrible to look at.
[246:17.03]Do I just kill everything?
[246:19.47]I think I just kill everything.
[246:28.17]Oh, don't do damage to myself.
[246:38.60]Okay.
[246:40.56]I'm going to go this way.
[246:42.53]Dude, first person shooter and car game.
[246:47.52]I think I just ran somebody over.
[246:54.94]Alright, this is kind of cool.
[247:04.81]I thought this was kind of like shit at first, but it's kind of fun.
[247:20.06]Find the radio station and stop the Red Sixers.
[247:38.53]Well, the more orange the screen gets, the more deadly everything is.
[247:43.69]Radio station.
[247:47.78]How do I get out?
[247:53.08]Where's this other car?
[248:12.65]The music is over.
[248:14.49]I got to the end of the loop.
[248:16.61]It was like a six minute loop.
[248:19.35]OK, now how do I get into the radio station?
[248:37.16]E, F, enter.
[248:38.34]It looks like I can go in there.
[248:39.24]I can go down there, right?
[248:45.83]Oh.
[248:46.39]Tab.
[248:46.85]No.
[248:47.64]E. R. F. Hold F. Hold E. X. Maybe it's not here.
[249:10.91]Why does it want me to aim up there?
[249:18.66]How did I get in?
[249:19.30]Uh, I think it was enter.
[249:20.62]Escape?
[249:23.43]Wait, maybe go to settings.
[249:25.27]Controls, here we go.
[249:30.67]Uh... You could just... Okay.
[249:38.52]Exit.
[249:39.48]Left.
[249:40.18]Delete.
[249:45.83]That's a... That's a weird key, but whatever.
[249:48.13]Alright, let's go.
[249:56.10]Whoa.
[249:57.82]I got a weed whacker?
[249:58.86]Dead.
[250:09.85]They're not very good at shooting at you, I will say.
[250:14.50]Where do I go from here?
[250:24.58]I just went ba- What?
[250:26.86]It's just a wraparound?
[250:27.93]Oh, it wraps around.
[250:29.59]Does it go anywhere else?
[250:31.97]Wait.
[250:33.52]Oh my goodness.
[250:36.23]Holy shit, this guy's... This guy's huge.
[250:49.36]He went down.
[250:57.57]The hell... Why do I hear like a monster?
[251:08.02]Cool, new gun.
[251:14.23]Join me for dinner, chump?
[251:23.56]What's that you say, chump?
[251:28.51]Eat me?
[251:29.05]Don't mind if I do!
[251:34.66]I'm sorry, I could've just killed him.
[251:36.84]I'm sorry.
[251:40.32]Oh, no.
[251:42.16]Okay.
[251:42.75]Alright.
[251:43.47]Alright.
[251:43.75]Alright.
[251:43.97]Everybody relax.
[251:45.33]Everybody relax.
[251:46.07]Everybody relax.
[251:47.79]I screwed up big time.
[251:49.86]That's on me, and I'm very sorry.
[251:56.97]I'm so sorry.
[251:57.25]I'm going to speedrun it.
[252:01.74]I'm going to speedrun it.
[252:10.76]I'm driving with the mouse, by the way.
[252:38.14]We gotta get to the first cutscene after this.
[252:40.12]We have to.
[252:41.50]I don't care.
[252:53.28]Why am I hearing another song?
[252:58.07]Is that what they're playing in their car?
[253:11.68]Alright, here we go.
[253:25.54]Here we go.
[253:58.90]Is it because of my frame rate's too high?
[254:02.68]It actually might be because my frame rate's too high.
[254:14.38]Minimum FOV?
[254:15.48]I don't think I can even make it higher.
[254:16.68]No, you can't.
[254:26.39]This game was made in like 2006, guys, or 2004.
[254:33.12]I'm gonna kill him right now, don't worry.
[254:35.89]Oh my god!
[254:37.11]Okay, give me the super rocket launcher.
[254:55.40]God damn it, I just killed myself.
[255:12.58]He's not dead.
[255:16.71]This guy's got cauldrons up here?
[255:22.95]Oh my god, no!
[255:26.94]What?
[255:41.13]I won.
[255:46.70]Hey there, buddy.
[255:47.68]My name's Bork.
[255:49.02]Company sent me.
[255:50.49]Looks like you took care of business here.
[255:52.39]Your petition to join has been accepted.
[255:55.96]Grab that rig and follow me.
[255:57.98]Someone I want you to meet.
[256:00.69]It's like when you talk to your girl sexy to the phone.
[256:22.88]Hey, what's up, babe?
[256:24.16]I just want to let you know, like, we're thinking about you, you know, just chilling.
[256:28.55]What are you doing?
[256:35.12]Watch out for those bugs.
[256:47.10]And what are we doing in here again?
[256:56.27]This music is just... I gotta turn the music down.
[257:12.79]Oh, I gotta settle down.
[257:26.66]It's Sub-Zero!
[257:30.44]That's the best comment of the whole night.
[257:50.12]I said, this looks like Warcraft 3 custom game cutscenes.
[257:55.15]That is the most unbelievably correct specific thing you could say.
[257:58.69]They really do.
[257:59.95]They're doing the animation.
[258:00.90]We're like, I'm going to move my arm up and to put my hand down and put my arm.
[258:12.71]Oh, that was great.
[258:14.63]That's the best comment of the whole night.
[258:29.42]Does this song play through the entire game?
[258:32.23]Does it ever stop?
[258:40.74]Press enter for mission update.
[258:43.84]Locate and destroy the first Orgon Accumulator.
[258:48.71]Okay, I'll try.
[258:50.53]Are these Orgon Accumulators?
[259:15.58]That Warcraft comm is gonna stare at me for like a week.
[259:35.01]Hold on.
[259:38.13]Wait a minute!
[259:39.40]Wait a minute!
[259:43.91]I think this is a bug in the game because... I think there's a bug going on here because this song has been going from the very beginning of the opening cutscene.
[260:01.45]Was it?
[260:13.56]Dude, it's the CD audio.
[260:18.95]It just plays the CD.
[260:30.76]Alright, let's get a vote in chat right now.
[260:33.85]Um... Enable or disable CD audio?
[260:42.11]I can't imagine I'll be playing this for another 15 minutes.
[260:48.38]I'm going to let you decide.
[261:00.60]Why is it an option?
[261:03.20]Because the stream is in your hands tonight.
[261:09.49]Am I going to run
[261:11.93]with this shit.
[261:15.37]On for the next probably 10 to 20 straight minutes.
[261:24.33]Stop acting like this is a democratic stream.
[261:25.95]It's a dictatorship.
[261:31.70]Well, it's a dictatorship that I allow some interesting things sometimes when I feel like it.
[261:40.59]For you to decide sometimes.
[261:43.25]Rarely.
[261:44.85]Very rarely.
[261:47.97]Alright, what's the poll say?
[261:49.19]I can't alt-tab or I'll crash my computer.
[261:51.02]7030 says enable.
[262:04.31]I'm not going to listen to that one guy.
[262:08.27]68% say enable it.
[262:10.47]Okay.
[262:11.42]Well, people have spoken.
[262:20.56]Okay, let's go.
[262:29.11]No, get out of the car!
[262:33.27]Who is... Oh my god!
[262:36.78]What the hell was that?!
[262:37.80]Somebody just chainsawed me!
[262:39.82]Somebody just chainsawed me from behind!
[262:41.32]Okay, don't get out of the car.
[263:01.84]Oh my goodness gracious.
[263:08.69]I got here in my mouth.
[263:19.22]They you know we're going to do at some point here soon.
[263:21.05]I brought this up the other day.
[263:25.41]We're doing a full, complete Quinson series franchise playthrough.
[263:36.77]We're doing a little Big Adventure.
[263:38.43]A little Big Adventure 2.
[263:45.86]And it's going to be sick.
[263:50.55]Some of my favorite games.
[263:53.00]And that's a lie because I actually never played the first one all the way through.
[263:59.04]Quentin's Odyssey I've played many times.
[264:02.69]The game is very hard.
[264:04.85]I've never actually beaten it.
[264:08.72]Locate and destroy the first Orgon Accumulator.
[264:12.36]Where the hell even is that?
[264:17.63]What, Max Payne?
[264:19.31]I own Max Payne 1, 2, and 3.
[264:23.70]That will happen also.
[264:27.88]What about Dawn of War?
[264:30.57]I've talked to the horseman about that.
[264:34.88]We've said fog champ to that.
[264:36.86]Okay, that is awful.
[264:38.90]What is going on?
[264:39.93]Is this an Argon collector?
[264:54.14]Something just exploded.
[265:02.97]Do I jump this?
[265:10.44]What about Devil May Cry?
[265:12.18]I have no plans to play Devil May Cry.
[265:21.40]That's just where I started.
[265:22.56]Oh, it is.
[265:31.96]Where do I go from here?
[265:36.32]This is kind of a tiny area for a game with a car in it.
[265:40.14]Am I crazy?
[265:41.85]This is two cross streets.
[265:50.06]It's definitely right there, right?
[265:53.46]How do you open doors?
[266:02.33]It has to be that door.
[266:03.47]Look at that.
[266:04.90]That's absolutely where it is.
[266:10.26]Back to where you blew up the radar dish?
[266:17.14]Oh, I see.
[266:20.48]Oops.
[266:30.29]You're either very good or very lucky.
[266:33.18]We're about to find out which.
[266:35.12]You need to take out the rest of the accumulators and find a way into the construction pit.
[266:40.14]I already did that.
[266:40.92]This guy's like 10 minutes stream delay.
[266:43.74]Alright, they give me a lot of these.
[266:57.22]Why?
[267:19.53]Who's shooting?
[267:23.22]What happened to the CD audio?
[267:33.61]I didn't want to shoot him that close.
[267:52.46]Excuse me, who is... What the hell?!
[268:04.01]Someone dropped a fucking missile!
[268:15.90]Do a torch-only Bloodborne run.
[268:20.07]I'll do that when they announce the remake.
[268:25.43]There we go.
[268:26.43]Now I feel better.
[268:27.33]I feel like way better now.
[268:43.00]I gotta get four more of these.
[268:44.84]That's trying my patience a little.
[268:48.10]I will say that's the patience meter is going to drop significantly.
[268:54.67]I'm willing to do it though.
[269:04.57]Oh shit!
[269:05.15]I'm not in my car!
[269:07.65]Oh no!
[269:21.77]That was a really fake sounding oh no.
[269:40.78]I'm far enough away, right?
[269:41.84]OK.
[269:43.28]Holy shit, maybe I wasn't.
[269:49.43]I. OK, move on.
[269:52.24]I'm doing the next one.
[269:53.80]This game is crazy, but I'm going to open the next game.
[270:08.08]That was a red line.
[270:09.56]And it was wild.
[270:15.87]Okay, we got... I got a bunch.
[270:18.01]I have a lot of stuff I could play.
[270:19.75]A lot.
[270:20.80]And when I say a lot, I mean way too much.
[270:26.18]That will probably never ever be... I'll never be able to play all these.
[270:30.39]I could stream one of these every day.
[270:32.87]And it would probably take like four years to do them all.
[270:43.45]Let's try this one.
[270:44.31]This one is gonna be, the audio might be kind of absolutely cooked.
[270:53.29]But this is called Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O' Fun.
[270:57.95]This is a very old DOS game.
[271:01.28]Give it a try.
[271:17.88]Turn your shit down.
[271:39.94]Turn your shit down.
[271:41.12]This is outrageous.
[271:41.52]This is malware, dude?
[271:42.64]It's not malware!
[271:43.00]I'm laser-beaming into your head.
[271:43.68]I told you to turn it down.
[271:44.24]I told you to turn it down.
[271:44.80]Holy shit, look at this limo.
[271:47.34]Is this supposed to be carnival music?
[271:58.73]Ugh!
[271:58.83]10 million watched happens tonight, dude!
[272:01.28]Legal mumbo jumbo!
[272:04.20]Dude, turn the sorting algorithm off!
[272:12.11]Hurry, hurry, hurry!
[272:16.46]Ugh!
[272:19.20]Alright, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[272:22.04]Take this beast.
[272:24.55]Next beast.
[272:25.35]Uh, who do I want to be?
[272:27.05]I'll... I don't know.
[272:29.09]I guess I'll be the monkey, I guess?
[272:32.32]Oh!
[272:40.03]Player one, level one.
[272:41.05]Oh my god.
[272:43.28]I feel like that changed me forever.
[272:45.86]I'm not gonna lie.
[272:51.38]Is this me?
[273:15.32]I'll have to go into the water.
[273:15.96]What the fuck?
[273:16.26]I didn't even get to- What happened?
[273:20.98]Why are the judges killing each other?
[273:22.44]Okay, what just happened?
[273:27.09]I got 32 cents!
[273:34.34]Okay, it's time to juggle.
[273:41.43]Okay.
[273:47.93]I'm gonna get huge.
[273:49.27]The judges are gonna love this.
[273:53.20]How do I throw that?
[273:53.70]How do I juggle?
[273:54.56]How do I?
[273:55.24]How do I?
[273:55.84]How do I?
[273:56.32]How?
[273:56.52]How?
[273:57.76]How?
[273:58.20]How?
[274:06.43]How?
[274:06.87]How?
[274:07.43]I don't know.
[274:10.72]I don't understand how this works.
[274:15.57]The judges didn't even want to judge it!
[274:17.11]It was so... This has got to be worth two bucks.
[274:26.30]I lost money.
[274:30.59]Oh my god.
[274:31.87]Okay.
[274:33.81]Is this a trapeze?
[274:40.58]I think that's me, that looks pretty cool.
[274:44.14]Oh no no, I'm at the top!
[274:46.37]Okay, here we go.
[274:54.80]I don't think I made it.
[274:56.92]I don't think I made it.
[275:02.87]Okay.
[275:03.01]I see.
[275:03.59]Alright, ready?
[275:10.02]What the fuck?!
[275:10.34]I tried to jump!
[275:21.50]Ugh.
[275:24.36]I got 80 bucks for that.
[275:25.93]That was worth 80.
[275:29.71]Here, let me help you out here.
[275:30.97]I'm gonna turn it down.
[275:36.36]What's this next one?
[275:39.76]Um... I don't wanna do this.
[275:47.05]Oh!
[275:47.23]I just hit her in the face.
[275:55.64]What the fuck?
[275:56.50]Get that out of here, man!
[276:04.31]Oh my god.
[276:09.87]Oh my god, it's so hard.
[276:20.16]How are you supposed to do this?
[276:30.06]I don't have... I'm done.
[276:33.41]This sounds like... Well, that wasn't cool.
[276:48.05]We need 10 grand?
[276:52.94]Whatever.
[276:58.97]Ooh, alright.
[277:00.98]Be slow.
[277:16.80]I'm gonna get a fucking 10 from this one.
[277:18.43]Hey, I'll make the 10 grand right now.
[277:27.30]What is that?
[277:32.33]Level two.
[277:35.44]They're gonna make it harder?
[277:36.34]Okay.
[277:43.15]They got all kinds of goofy shit happening around me now.
[277:48.89]I didn't even do that.
[277:50.08]Somebody just... just killed that guy.
[277:52.72]I didn't even do that.
[277:53.38]It had nothing to do with me.
[277:54.60]That was outrageous.
[277:58.03]Well, how am I supposed to avoid a guy throwing a saw blade at me?
[278:00.75]How am I... I don't... doesn't make any sense.
[278:04.50]What?
[278:08.94]Yeah, and, um... Am I okay?
[278:15.03]Again, I... They're just killing these people.
[278:18.75]I didn't do anything.
[278:20.21]I'm just trying to walk on the rope.
[278:29.98]Hey, 800.
[278:37.59]Okay, this one is shoot you out of a cannon.
[278:44.52]Okay.
[278:47.78]So do I just go- do I go in?
[278:54.71]Um... I guess I'm pointing.
[278:58.21]I'm saying this way.
[278:59.53]This way.
[279:00.43]I'm saying this way.
[279:02.62]Um... I'm saying go this way.
[279:05.66]And... I-
[279:12.15]Can we get that guy out of the turcus?
[279:15.19]That guy's been doing this the whole time.
[279:19.13]The audio's definitely fucked up.
[279:20.56]It is not.
[279:21.70]I can assure you the audio is very clear and very clean.
[279:26.10]This is, uh, this is MS-DOS.
[279:36.75]This is kind of, uh, menacing.
[279:42.91]Oh no.
[279:51.48]Oh, they made... they made a bunch of fast food restaurants and like a big... a big office building.
[280:05.70]Okay.
[280:07.80]Well, that was interesting.
[280:10.87]Um... cool.
[280:12.85]That one's... that was... I... is it weird that I want to play this again?
[280:17.98]If I turn it down, I'm gonna play it again.
[280:19.44]I... I want to get a better score.
[280:26.53]One more time.
[280:27.07]Now that I know how the games work... Okay, so when you dive...
[280:38.14]Some asshole.
[280:38.98]That guy that's been messing with us the whole time.
[280:41.31]He blows a big... He comes over and knocks you over or blows a fan at you or something.
[280:47.76]So I have to compensate for that.
[280:48.64]So he's going to come from the left, so I'm going to be over here.
[280:56.29]Right?
[280:57.45]Yep.
[280:58.93]He's on the other side this time.
[281:01.08]Come on, man.
[281:01.82]Are you kidding me?
[281:16.35]Do you hate people with ears?
[281:19.95]Do- I- I have this down to, like, 5% volume.
[281:30.10]Alright, this one was weird, because you have to, like, throw them in the air.
[281:32.27]Okay, I get it.
[281:37.47]You have to swap.
[281:40.30]Oh boy.
[281:41.66]Oh boy, this is a disaster already.
[281:44.46]Okay, here we go.
[281:50.67]Dude, I can't audio- ugh.
[281:53.22]I'm just gonna Alt-F4 this game.
[282:00.19]You have to juggle it back.
[282:08.84]This one I didn't understand either.
[282:22.30]How am I supposed to know when the rope is coming back the other way?
[282:25.24]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[282:34.88]Okay.
[282:36.10]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[282:42.12]Oh my god, it's not possible.
[282:54.59]Is the rope even long enough to grab?
[282:56.12]It looks like it's not even, yeah, somebody just said it's not even long enough.
[282:59.56]Okay, this one is just weird.
[283:01.16]I gotta stay in the same spot.
[283:20.05]Alright, what are you supposed to do with the, are you supposed to do anything with the bomb?
[283:27.74]Okay.
[283:30.88]Ah, that was it.
[283:43.22]No!
[283:43.52]Damn it!
[283:49.19]I can't...
[283:56.78]Too hard.
[283:57.40]It's too hard.
[283:58.22]I wanna do the canon one again.
[283:59.30]I just got here.
[284:10.09]What are you playing?
[284:10.68]Uh, this is Fiendish Freddy's Big Top of Fun.
[284:15.40]And it is just as... mind-numbing as you could probably imagine it is.
[284:24.03]I bought cashew chicken from my favorite Chinese place because you said you liked it.
[284:27.30]You're either lying or you also like to eat dog poop.
[284:31.10]That person is just what a funny liar.
[284:35.63]You know what I mean?
[284:36.23]Like you definitely ate it and you're like, this is great.
[284:37.83]And I'm just going to go into the chat and just be a dipshit.
[284:42.52]I know for a fact you ate it and you were like, man, this is pretty good.
[284:44.94]And I'm going to go in the chat and say, hey, it sucks.
[284:46.63]And I know he's going to read it because he loves cashew chicken.
[284:49.51]So he's going to read it and he's going to get crashed out over it.
[285:00.67]Especially because you said, I like to eat dog poop.
[285:03.81]Because we all know.
[285:05.31]We all know that dog poop is not even in the same category as cashew chicken, right?
[285:12.04]You could say, ugh, it's kind of gross.
[285:14.38]But, like, dog poop is not even edible.
[285:16.28]No one is eating dog poop.
[285:21.35]Hey, dude, stop with Crash Out.
[285:24.19]I'm just, I'm trying to stay with the times, okay?
[285:26.75]I've been streaming for 15 or 16 years.
[285:29.10]I gotta keep up with the times.
[285:38.08]Alright, I wanna do this one.
[285:42.81]Why does it get to you so much?
[285:45.55]It doesn't.
[285:48.09]It doesn't- I don't care.
[285:49.08]Hey, can you be a- a- upset at- hold on.
[285:56.71]Okay, here we go.
[285:58.17]Shoot it.
[286:00.11]I wanna go right there.
[286:03.78]Uh...
[286:10.50]Alright, that was Fiendish Freddy's big top of fun.
[286:13.58]It was a- it was great.
[286:17.33]Wait, I get to do it again.
[286:18.05]Okay, and how do I do the angle?
[286:25.68]I'm trying to- I- how do I aim the angle?
[286:31.01]There it is.
[286:33.05]Holy shit.
[286:34.00]What a- that was a perfect shot.
[286:49.22]Okay, I get to do it again.
[286:54.27]I get it now.
[287:08.73]Line drive.
[287:09.13]That was better.
[287:23.23]Alright, that's... come on.
[287:25.13]That's gonna be pretty good.
[287:36.23]Okay, 300 bucks?
[287:40.07]Alright.
[287:42.08]Uh, that was Freddy's... whatever it is.
[287:44.36]Freddy's Big Top of Fun.
[287:50.95]Take a look at that green.
[287:52.92]Alright, we got time for maybe one more little one?
[287:58.80]Maybe?
[287:59.16]Let's see.
[288:02.05]What's a little one I could do right now?
[288:04.41]We could stay in that same realm of weird DOS games that are just bizarre.
[288:08.12]I've been wanting to play this one for a little while.
[288:10.20]This one's called Weird Dreams.
[288:16.01]Weird Dreams.
[288:19.29]I'm going to make sure this one is not loud either.
[288:33.98]I feel like I need to know how to control the game.
[288:36.74]So, let's see.
[288:39.79]Here we go.
[288:40.39]Okay.
[288:42.13]Alright.
[288:42.35]Somebody remember this.
[288:43.73]I need somebody to remember this.
[288:46.83]Up, right, left, down.
[288:50.79]Key is pause.
[288:54.38]Insert.
[288:57.08]The home key.
[288:59.62]Alt and control.
[289:07.46]Okay.
[289:12.08]Sounds good.
[289:14.29]Do it.
[289:22.21]Uh... VGA?
[289:26.78]Um... Which one of these do I pick?
[289:31.74]IBM Sound Effects?
[289:35.77]Or... IBM Sound Effects and Music.
[289:40.43]Okay.
[289:44.13]Okay, I can turn it up.
[289:48.28]It's not going to be too loud because DOS games are great.
[289:50.50]They sound crazy.
[289:55.64]Okay, here we go.
[290:03.11]So apparently I'm having a weird dream.
[290:11.28]Okay.
[290:14.33]I don't know what that means, but I got like bugs on me?
[290:16.85]I think I'm already dead.
[290:21.90]I'm so glad I turned this down.
[290:28.30]Alright, so get out?
[290:29.14]How do I leave?
[290:44.66]What the hell?
[290:45.16]You just grab the ladder?
[290:46.46]Maybe just stand here.
[291:03.45]This is a cotton candy machine.
[291:08.43]Am I safe?
[291:16.32]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[291:25.85]Can I... Maybe I can just duck.
[291:27.49]I need to grab the candy.
[291:29.55]Maybe when it's candy, I should touch it.
[291:36.69]Oh, okay.
[291:37.69]I gotta collect all the candy floating around.
[291:39.98]Okay, yep.
[291:40.64]I know what to do.
[291:46.19]Don't get hit by the thing and collect all the candy.
[291:49.32]Got it.
[291:54.21]Oh my god.
[291:55.17]That just really made me angry.
[292:09.55]Okay, come on.
[292:12.03]Somebody said this game gets crazy.
[292:13.15]Keep going.
[292:13.83]I will beat at least the Cotton Candy level.
[292:23.65]Oh my god, it's so hard!
[292:25.15]Maybe they'll just come to me if I duck.
[292:43.62]I think this is the strategy.
[292:49.14]Is that not... Is this not doing anything?
[293:05.08]Oh!
[293:06.02]Here comes Freddy!
[293:08.50]Um...
[293:15.31]Out of order, out of order.
[293:17.33]Whoa.
[293:19.31]That was weird.
[293:20.29]Should I go up?
[293:21.39]Or down?
[293:30.34]Should I grab a fish?
[293:32.29]Can you die from the fish?
[293:35.25]Oh, I got one.
[293:36.63]What the fuck is that thing?
[293:38.93]Okay, goodbye.
[293:41.16]I have a fish.
[293:46.14]Oh, God.
[293:47.40]Stuck in the desert now.
[293:58.95]Do I have to fight it with a fish?
[294:03.07]Okay, I'm ready.
[294:06.76]What?
[294:07.10]Oh.
[294:08.40]There's a mirage over there.
[294:12.60]Oh, God.
[294:13.02]This is not good.
[294:17.54]My mother warned me about these kinds of games.
[294:25.77]I think I might be trapped here forever.
[294:28.19]Let me try going back.
[294:42.49]You stole that joke from chat?
[294:45.17]But I read that chat member's thing.
[294:46.99]No, yeah, that wasn't supposed to be me saying that.
[294:50.21]That was me reading a chat member.
[294:51.84]Hold on.
[294:54.72]I think the weird... shrimp penis thing killed me, okay?
[295:03.39]These don't start all the way over.
[295:07.64]Ooh, okay.
[295:10.28]I got a stick.
[295:17.80]That was instant?
[295:22.19]Your score is zero.
[295:23.21]I... Yo, I'm sorry, when I walk into the flowers and I get killed instantly.
[295:28.01]What?
[295:44.79]Alright, fine, I'll go this way.
[295:48.45]I can't.
[296:14.26]Jump over them?
[296:14.58]You little asshole.
[296:18.15]Maybe a fish will do it?
[296:22.96]Okay.
[296:23.66]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[296:24.72]Here's what we're gonna... Here's the plan.
[296:26.46]We're gonna go left.
[296:27.14]We're gonna get a fish.
[296:28.02]We're gonna... Oh, wait.
[296:29.27]Hold on.
[296:31.95]We're gonna get a fish.
[296:32.61]We're gonna bring fish over to the hungry plants.
[296:39.20]Get out of the cotton candy machine.
[296:40.37]First of all.
[296:47.27]You don't want to lose a life there!
[297:01.57]Rabbit!
[297:04.15]Oh, you dumbass.
[297:10.22]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[297:15.34]I'll see you tomorrow.
[297:17.13]I'm going to call it right here.
[297:27.01]We will pick this up tomorrow.
[297:29.38]Dude, Freddy, that Freddy game was crazy.
[297:39.75]They were a lot of good ones.
[297:40.67]I mean, we only played four, but I feel like I liked all of them.
[297:44.19]Wait, no.
[297:46.59]Five?
[297:49.09]I forgot, well no, red line.
[297:51.82]Red line was, red line was alright.
[297:54.74]I give that one a C+.
[297:55.56]I give it a C-.
[297:56.58]Alright, we'll see you tomorrow.
[298:06.19]Tomorrow, probably, probably around the same time.
[298:08.34]I like these later afternoon, evening streams.
[298:11.10]They feel a little... A little more like the end of the day, right?
[298:19.36]But yeah, see you tomorrow.
[298:20.10]5 p.m.
[298:21.98]Pacific.
[298:23.55]Thanks for sticking around.
[298:24.39]Thanks for hanging out.
[298:27.11]I gotta turn this game off.
[298:29.31]It's crazy.
[298:43.31]Hey, what was your favorite game of the day?
[298:46.26]Mine...
[298:49.23]I loved the first one.
[298:52.09]I thought that was a lot of fun.
[298:54.78]We're going to see Borrowed Forge tomorrow, so... Hey, let me know in the comments what you guys thought was your favorite game of the night.
[299:13.80]Play Gothic 2?
[299:18.49]I have a never-ending treasure trove of games.
[299:25.00]I went absolutely wild on GOG.
[299:28.86]Just say that.
[299:43.80]But, uh, Yahtzee?
[299:44.80]Yahtzee is a lot of fun.
[299:47.82]Last time I played that was, what was, uh, weeks, right?
[299:52.84]That was fun.
[300:03.78]I feel like having a, what a Yahtzee tournament would be fun to watch.
[300:18.68]I feel like it would be fun for the first 30 minutes and then you realize that it's just Yahtzee for like the next three hours.
[300:24.13]I don't know.
[300:30.32]Hey, stop with the tournaments.
[300:37.27]I've done one.
[300:38.26]Yeah, you know of another one that's coming.
[300:41.72]I've done one tournament.
[300:46.43]I have one tournament that I've ever real- House Flipper.
[300:51.03]House Flipper Invitational.
[300:52.09]Invitational 2, Invitational 3.
[300:54.10]That's the only tournament I've ever put together.
[300:56.60]Ever.
[301:04.41]But, have a good night.
[301:05.43]See you later, see you tomorrow.
[301:06.96]Oh, you bother, you know the deal.
[301:09.92]What happened to the Monster Rancher tournament?
[301:11.20]Still gonna happen.
[301:14.68]That is in the plans over the next couple of weeks.
[301:17.17]I'd say next two or three weeks.
[301:20.80]See you later.
[301:21.30]Take care.
[301:24.38]Bye for now.
