[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.88]Yeah, you can just call me.
[00:05.17]On time, Andy.
[00:07.57]How's my mic?
[00:08.87]Sound bad?
[00:09.27]I'm playing around with settings.
[00:11.89]I think it sounds fine.
[00:16.03]That's good.
[00:16.73]Alright.
[00:19.76]Hello, everybody.
[00:20.32]How are you?
[00:20.72]Let me tweet.
[00:22.28]Let me tweet first.
[00:32.96]Tweet has been out.
[00:35.68]Very good.
[00:39.81]Thought you were playing hard time.
[00:41.13]Yeah, I was.
[00:44.05]Until I wasn't.
[00:46.63]So here's why I'm not playing hard time.
[00:49.65]MDickey has two or three iPad Android exclusive mobile games.
[00:59.06]So I'm like, there's a superhero one.
[01:02.75]It's where you pick a superhero, and it's MDickey's Superhero World.
[01:07.16]So I was like, you know what?
[01:08.46]Why don't we just, like, do it a day?
[01:10.86]Where I just play all the MDickey iPad games.
[01:17.67]And then I was told that there's, like, three versions of Hard Time.
[01:20.53]And, like, one of them's the one to play or something.
[01:23.03]So I was like, you know what?
[01:24.03]I'll figure that out.
[01:26.31]In the meantime, this is a highly requested game.
[01:32.45]Diablo II waiting room?
[01:36.07]You've got like a month to wait for that.
[01:40.22]And I'm not going to stream Diablo II.
[01:46.50]I don't even know if I'm going to play Diablo II.
[01:48.22]You know what I mean?
[01:49.50]I have no idea.
[01:56.22]When's the next Sims stream?
[01:58.75]Well, I have all the mods.
[01:59.97]I just didn't want it to be like... Dollhouse!
[02:02.77]Sims 3!
[02:03.73]I'm The Sims guy!
[02:04.85]Come on back from the dollhouse and check out The Sims 3!
[02:07.03]So I was like, you know what, we'll... I have a bunch of fucked up mods.
[02:12.07]We'll play with it some other time.
[02:18.92]Maybe like next week or something.
[02:20.94]So here's how this is gonna go, okay?
[02:24.04]Today, we're gonna play SnowRunner.
[02:26.86]And I heard it's quite a rage game.
[02:29.44]You better be ready for that one.
[02:31.90]You drive around in big trucks and have to deliver stuff.
[02:35.40]And you have to be careful.
[02:39.88]The meltdown?
[02:40.50]I don't know if it's... It's not possible for a meltdown.
[02:44.22]I don't have the brain power to do a meltdown right now.
[02:47.62]No way.
[02:49.22]Even if I wanted to get really angry, it would just hit a wall.
[02:53.37]And I'd be like, what the... Fuck.
[02:55.51]Fuck.
[02:56.89]I'm just like, so I'm still kind of coming down from the dollhouse, even though it was like a week ago.
[03:02.16]I'm coming off like the high of the dollhouse week.
[03:05.68]So I figured we'll just chill today.
[03:07.18]No More Heroes 3 is out too, by the way.
[03:11.06]So we're going to do that this coming weekend.
[03:14.20]I heard it's long too.
[03:15.27]No More Heroes 3 is like 17, 16 hours long.
[03:22.51]The first two were like 11 hours, 10 hours.
[03:25.09]It's a longer game.
[03:34.14]This game is going to lay waste to your attention span.
[03:37.02]Is it?
[03:38.42]Is it a hard game?
[03:43.93]LOL, do you do drugs?
[03:47.39]I mean, if you count acetaminophen.
[03:51.21]Ibuprofen.
[03:53.37]Sometimes.
[03:53.71]No, I'm not high right now.
[03:59.88]I'm not.
[04:04.07]Although I've told you this before, but it is a great excuse.
[04:08.65]Anytime I do something stupid, it's because he's high today.
[04:13.35]Yep.
[04:13.81]Yeah, sure.
[04:14.81]That's why I can't add six and four in less than 10 seconds.
[04:18.71]Yeah, I can't do eight plus seven because I just got high today.
[04:22.95]You know, you guys are right.
[04:25.65]So it's a great thing to fall back on for sure.
[04:28.05]Alright, let's go.
[04:29.77]Did I tweet this?
[04:31.31]Yeah.
[04:35.29]Welcome back.
[04:36.93]We're going back to normal.
[04:38.01]We're kind of closing the book on the last week of Insanity.
[04:43.31]On to the next one.
[04:44.01]There's already plans on the next two.
[04:47.27]Larger streams.
[04:48.47]I'm very excited.
[04:50.61]And we're just going to do them.
[04:51.72]If they're fun, then I'm going to try to do them.
[04:55.52]There will be more details on those soon.
[04:57.38]And also, I want to make this clear.
[04:58.56]Grotto Beasts is not just gone.
[05:04.31]Strato Beast is here.
[05:05.49]It'll be here.
[05:07.81]You'll be able to buy it before the end of the year.
[05:10.04]We're really hoping that somewhere around Christmas time.
[05:12.64]Like the November, December space.
[05:17.60]I want you guys to be able to get your hands on those.
[05:20.42]And now that all the dollhouse stuff is done, the months of that, all that work, we're going to focus on some of the smaller projects that aren't huge, gigantic streams.
[05:29.44]And Grotto Beasts and the Jerma Craft server are the next kind of coming up in line.
[05:35.66]So let's play SnowRunner.
[05:36.66]Let's just do it.
[05:37.16]Am I cam on?
[05:38.60]I hope not.
[05:44.38]is baseball baseball is gonna be hopefully if it's not by the end of October of this year just weather you can't really play baseball in like November or December it's just not possible unless we go to like a dome but I don't think we're gonna go to a dome uh if it's not October end of October this year then that's the first thing that'll happen around like the spring training time February march hopefully of 2022.
[06:19.35]What is baseball, though?
[06:21.17]Something that I've wanted to do for over a year, that was ready to go a year ago, and COVID fucked the whole thing up.
[06:29.46]So, it's just done, and it's ready, but I can't do it.
[06:34.04]Well, it's not done, but you know what I mean.
[06:36.30]Alright, SnowRunner.
[06:37.70]Am I gonna fucking hate this game?
[06:41.15]I don't know.
[06:41.53]We're gonna find out.
[06:42.67]Let me turn it up.
[06:47.35]I'm not gonna play it on hard mode.
[06:48.53]By the way, I got a 3090.
[06:49.61]So, uh, this should look really good.
[06:53.78]Like only the second or third game I've played on this 3090.
[06:55.74]Alright, let's go.
[06:57.08]New campaign.
[06:59.30]Plot one.
[07:04.36]This guy's rich, he has a 3090.
[07:05.78]No, this guy's got a 3090 because he had to pay like 100% ultra premium to make a new computer.
[07:13.75]Don't think that like, oh wow, that's cool.
[07:15.73]No, I got like scammed because I bought like 50% over market price.
[07:21.26]Like that's not cool.
[07:22.52]Like that's stupid.
[07:23.78]I did a dumb, stupid, idiot thing.
[07:28.22]Thank you for joining our recovery and maintenance effort after the devastating flood.
[07:31.97]We need all help available to repair the bridge that collapsed.
[07:35.43]It's our only link to the other side of the river.
[07:38.65]Disposable income Andy.
[07:42.45]Stop it!
[07:44.98]Hey, there's a lot of new people here, okay?
[07:46.68]We gotta like, I'm Jerma, and I'm cool.
[07:51.32]First need to find a watchtower to get a view of your surroundings.
[07:56.17]Alright, I need to find a watchtower.
[07:58.57]And you'll have to find a truck capable of transporting- is this like a- do I walk around as a human?
[08:02.38]You have to find a truck capable of transporting the materials needed to repair the bridge.
[08:08.18]After the bridge is repaired, you will be able to reach your first... garage.
[08:13.83]Find a watchtower, find a truck.
[08:16.99]Okay.
[08:19.23]I was gonna say, what the hell is that?
[08:21.25]Oh, shit.
[08:22.39]Plus one letter grade automatically.
[08:23.61]Alright, remove handbrake.
[08:25.35]Start engine.
[08:27.01]Your first move should always be to scout new areas.
[08:29.81]Open the map.
[08:33.61]Your tracked objective always shows up here.
[08:35.63]Let's go find that watchtower.
[08:38.80]Uh... Okay.
[08:40.86]Guys, is there a straight line?
[08:42.50]Is it already an F?
[08:45.50]You can't give a game an F before I've even hit the accelerate button.
[08:48.92]Okay.
[08:50.84]Okay.
[08:54.52]We're in Michigan, Alaska, Tamir, Kola Peninsula, and Yukon.
[09:01.43]Alright.
[09:01.71]So these are different areas.
[09:04.15]So we're in the flooded foothills.
[09:06.41]Big Salmon Peak.
[09:07.88]Alright, whatever.
[09:08.70]Accept.
[09:12.02]So we're in the flooded foothills, right?
[09:15.58]Oh, shit.
[09:18.48]Alright, so we just have to drive... Here's a watchtower right here.
[09:21.05]Alright, so can I put a waypoint on it?
[09:25.40]Did you pirate the game?
[09:26.76]This game is on Steam.
[09:28.16]What do you mean did I pirate the game?
[09:31.03]This game is available on Steam.
[09:33.41]I got it on Steam.
[09:34.61]Why would I even pirate the game?
[09:38.07]Okay.
[09:38.41]In order to access this region, find a garage.
[09:41.57]Why can't I... I keep thinking of like the English way to say that word.
[09:44.76]A garage.
[09:45.52]A garage.
[09:46.24]Right?
[09:46.64]I don't know why I keep... Just to say garage.
[09:48.16]Don't do like the English way.
[09:51.92]Please travel to Alaska.
[09:54.35]No, alright, well, what do I do?
[10:00.17]Alright, find a watchtower.
[10:01.29]How do I drive?
[10:05.77]Oh, why would the handbrake be on?
[10:08.46]Alright, hold on, I gotta... Ah, it's too much mud!
[10:20.07]I wouldn't want to drive through this.
[10:21.69]When driving on rough terrain, you can switch to low gear.
[10:24.19]It'll slow you down, but will lower the risk of getting stuck.
[10:28.83]Okay, so low gear, I won't get stuck.
[10:32.27]LB and press R to the left to activate.
[10:34.37]Alright, low gear.
[10:37.37]I won't get stuck in the mud.
[10:42.19]I already lost?
[10:43.37]No, I didn't lose.
[10:49.42]Your truck is all-wheel drive capable.
[10:51.36]The AWD will also help in tough terrain, but will increase your fuel consumption.
[10:55.50]Oh, should I have fuel?
[10:56.34]Hold L, B, and X to activate all-wheel drive.
[11:00.06]I don't need it right now.
[11:05.57]You should get off low gear when you're on a normal terrain.
[11:08.97]This is not normal terrain.
[11:10.11]Alright, all-wheel drive.
[11:12.07]Let's go.
[11:16.01]I love how there's just a guy in here.
[11:18.65]I like that.
[11:20.65]Plus .5 letter grade.
[11:25.00]Oh, is this normal terrain?
[11:26.00]It's not.
[11:27.34]Alright, turn off all wheel drive.
[11:33.22]This only happens in the pirated version.
[11:35.28]I bought this game.
[11:37.65]I own this game.
[11:45.39]Old people will be driving circles around you.
[11:47.61]It's raining in the mud.
[11:48.77]You guys don't know anything about all-wheel drive or anything.
[11:56.84]Guess what?
[11:57.12]I don't know anything about all-wheel drive either.
[12:01.04]I drive a Honda Civic.
[12:05.40]Alright, should I take off the... Let's take this off.
[12:08.62]How do I change that again?
[12:11.52]How do I change the gear?
[12:13.16]I want to go back to normal gear.
[12:17.27]Let's hold, is it left bumper?
[12:18.59]And there it is.
[12:20.67]Okay, A, auto.
[12:22.33]Wait, no.
[12:25.75]How do I?
[12:26.13]No, that's alright.
[12:26.65]Yeah, that's fine.
[12:29.21]Oh, shit.
[12:29.69]No, stay in low.
[12:32.53]Oops.
[12:33.27]Alright, I got to go all-wheel drive.
[12:35.99]If you're stuck, you can try using your winch and see if there's anything around that you can attach it to.
[12:41.82]Activate the functions menu with up to use your winch.
[12:45.50]I'm not stuck.
[12:50.33]How do I do all-wheel drive again?
[12:54.15]All-wheel drive.
[12:54.83]How do I do all-wheel drive?
[12:58.17]It was right bumper and something else, right?
[13:00.09]What was it?
[13:02.01]And X, right.
[13:02.46]Okay, there it is.
[13:02.84]Let's go.
[13:03.68]I'm not stuck.
[13:04.68]Fuck out of here.
[13:10.96]Why don't I just drive on the grass?
[13:11.98]Why am I driving on the road?
[13:12.86]This thing is so dirty.
[13:23.46]This is too low of a truck.
[13:24.64]You're going to get stuck.
[13:25.34]I'm fine.
[13:25.86]I think I'm going to be fine.
[13:31.62]I would never do this drive.
[13:32.70]Alright.
[13:33.78]Turn off all-wheel drive.
[13:34.86]I think I'm good.
[13:36.82]Here we go.
[13:37.10]There's a road right here.
[13:39.78]Take it off low.
[13:40.36]There's no need.
[13:45.48]Alright.
[13:45.82]Well, I'm... There's a road right here.
[13:47.03]Alright.
[13:47.29]Find a watchtower.
[13:48.05]Alright.
[13:48.63]We're back on... We're on the road.
[13:51.57]What's nitro?
[13:56.51]Alright, this drive's way, way different than I thought it was going to be on the road.
[13:59.59]Let's hit the brakes.
[14:01.11]Alright, hold on.
[14:02.00]Can you die?
[14:02.50]Can you die in this game?
[14:06.08]Alright, what should I go?
[14:07.36]Left?
[14:07.68]Should I go right?
[14:09.04]No, fuck that.
[14:09.58]We're going on the road.
[14:15.23]How do I activate the rockets?
[14:21.53]Did I put in an all-wheel drive and just fucking hit the gas as hard as I can?
[14:24.59]Oh, I've been playing for like 10 minutes.
[14:26.15]Alright, I'll do it one time.
[14:40.77]You will encounter different kinds of terrain such as road, dirt, mud, deep mud, water, rocky slides, snow, and ice.
[14:49.16]Only the most experienced drivers with well-equipped vehicles can drive on any kind of terrain.
[14:53.52]When in doubt, there's no shame in avoiding danger.
[14:56.78]You can find out more about the different types of terrain in the codex.
[15:00.10]Alright, so... Can I just drive through this?
[15:09.69]Can I drive through this?
[15:17.85]Yeah, alright, well I'll just do this way.
[15:20.45]How high is this water?
[15:21.17]Is the water too high?
[15:24.49]Alright, should I put an all-wheel drive?
[15:30.15]I don't know what to do.
[15:31.77]What are you supposed to do in this scenario?
[15:32.93]Alright, I'm just going to drive as fast as I can over this.
[15:34.69]I'm going all-wheel drive.
[15:36.45]I'm putting on the boosters and I'm just going to hit the gas.
[15:41.11]Alright, let's go!
[15:47.92]I've played the Oregon Trail.
[15:49.00]I'll make it.
[15:49.38]It's okay.
[16:00.34]Jerry got typhoid fever.
[16:01.74]Who cares?
[16:02.14]He was dying anyways.
[16:05.36]You can refuel here or near any vehicle that may... Okay.
[16:13.10]So how much gas... How much money do I have?
[16:17.59]If I drive into these, they explode?
[16:19.49]If I drive into them?
[16:22.31]Fuel, three gallons.
[16:24.92]Okay.
[16:26.32]How much does that cost?
[16:31.32]Find out.
[16:31.92]No, but there's like a... I don't want to... How does the game save?
[16:35.64]How do I change that camera angle?
[16:40.78]I don't want to use the winch.
[16:42.90]Your winch should be connected to a solid object.
[16:44.78]It's like the winch point on your vehicle and which point to an object in your surroundings.
[16:50.84]Wait, what?
[17:01.41]Okay.
[17:03.33]Um, hold on.
[17:07.93]Alright, attach winch.
[17:10.57]Here.
[17:11.93]And then select the winch point.
[17:13.05]Oh, wait, what does it attach to?
[17:18.20]No, I want to attach it.
[17:23.30]I want to put the winch over here.
[17:27.10]Show damage?
[17:30.22]Oh, I'm fine.
[17:30.82]I can fall everything.
[17:33.58]Can I attach it to this?
[17:34.45]Alright, attach winch.
[17:38.46]Put it on the back.
[17:40.38]And select the point.
[17:42.94]Oh, I see.
[17:43.48]Okay.
[17:45.02]You can't do it.
[17:47.54]Let's just... Okay.
[17:48.76]First, why to pull your winch?
[17:50.33]Try using your own engine power to pull yourself.
[17:59.31]What if I just drive away?
[18:09.10]No, I'm trying to rip the fucking sign down.
[18:11.12]Alright, well I can't do that.
[18:19.48]Honk?
[18:20.78]How do you honk?
[18:25.88]Okay.
[18:27.84]Alright, I tried to do it.
[18:29.21]I'm just gonna drive.
[18:31.19]Open the function to get more details about damaged parts.
[18:33.47]What did I just do?
[18:34.99]What's my damage?
[18:38.60]Oh, put the winch down.
[18:43.48]Delete trailer?
[18:44.96]Stop engine.
[18:45.72]Recover.
[18:46.92]How do I see the damage?
[18:52.24]Alright, well, fuck it.
[18:52.80]Whatever.
[18:53.06]I'm fine.
[18:53.40]Let's go.
[18:59.81]Where's the tower?
[19:01.93]Wait.
[19:03.35]Hold on.
[19:06.67]I have the map, right?
[19:09.41]Oh, fuck yeah.
[19:09.85]Let's just drive through the trees.
[19:15.25]This is an off-road game.
[19:16.07]You're not supposed to play by the rules.
[19:24.74]It's an all-wheel drive.
[19:25.70]Just fucking drive through the trees.
[19:27.98]I've done this in GTA a thousand times.
[19:38.85]Watch it.
[19:40.50]Note that watchtower ahead.
[19:41.60]Such icons will help you detect objective zones nearby.
[19:44.36]There we go.
[19:45.68]Look at that.
[19:47.52]That was simple.
[19:49.68]I did it.
[19:50.76]Good job.
[19:51.28]You discovered your first watchtower.
[19:52.44]Discovering watchtowers will reveal parts of the map.
[19:55.26]To repair the bridge, you need a bigger vehicle to transport materials.
[19:59.50]Hmm.
[20:00.96]Okay, open your map.
[20:02.60]Look at your surroundings.
[20:03.96]Find a truck capable of transporting the materials needed.
[20:06.20]Okay, so I gotta find a truck.
[20:07.22]A big truck.
[20:08.58]Capable of transporting shit.
[20:11.40]Alright.
[20:14.94]Is this Ubisoft?
[20:15.84]Yeah, it is.
[20:18.49]Even the menu looks like Ubisoft.
[20:23.09]This is way more elaborate than I thought it was gonna be.
[20:24.97]Oh, by the way, I thought those were guns on the left side.
[20:30.06]Discovering watchtowers will reveal part of the map.
[20:31.86]The fog covers essential points of interest like objectives, upgrades, and vehicles.
[20:37.52]By pressing right trigger, you can place markers on your map to help you navigate.
[20:41.00]You can delete the last marker with left trigger or clear your route by holding left trigger.
[20:45.84]Plan a route now.
[20:47.86]We're going to go to the truck, right?
[20:51.14]Base camp?
[20:52.59]Maybe if you're good.
[20:54.07]Maybe if you're good.
[20:56.75]Alright, let's do a route.
[20:58.89]There's a lumber mill.
[20:59.77]What's over here?
[21:01.77]Sideboard trailer.
[21:03.91]And there's a truck.
[21:05.91]Let's go get the truck.
[21:09.53]I just drive straight line!
[21:10.57]It's not even helping me.
[21:13.19]Okay, well, whatever.
[21:18.53]I'm going that way.
[21:23.21]How close can I get?
[21:23.85]Can I- is there a first person camera?
[21:34.82]Is there a save game?
[21:35.66]What if I- what if this hurts?
[21:38.27]What happened?
[21:41.74]Am I already stuck?
[21:42.40]Do you feel rage yet?
[21:53.01]Not really.
[21:53.47]Alright, get an all-wheel drive.
[21:56.01]Let's go.
[22:07.69]I don't want the camera.
[22:08.60]The camera's moving on in horrible, terrible places.
[22:11.64]There we go.
[22:14.78]I'm good.
[22:18.75]It's deep mud, but I'm fine.
[22:24.19]I gotta turn off the smart camera or whatever the hell this is.
[22:32.13]You're actually pretty good at this game.
[22:33.87]Well, I mean, it's the first level.
[22:36.17]Just wait till I get the Mack truck.
[22:37.83]Alright, now let's turn this way and just drive straight.
[22:44.21]Perfect.
[22:44.45]I don't need a route.
[22:45.35]I have plenty of gas, too.
[22:50.63]I'm going to all-wheel drive.
[22:51.33]Alright, get off this.
[22:51.91]Let's go.
[22:57.67]Don't crash into any trees.
[22:58.75]I'll be fine.
[23:06.16]Vehicle damage, what?
[23:07.74]You may repair your vehicle in the garage or use special service add-ons and trailers.
[23:12.08]Find details about the- What?
[23:14.20]You found your first highway truck.
[23:15.74]This truck is designed for roads.
[23:17.60]So there are no off-road options included.
[23:19.67]Try not to fall into the swamp or drive into deep mud.
[23:24.01]Fall into the swamp?
[23:30.61]How would I fall into the swamp if I'm just driving on the road?
[23:36.12]Okay, you can find out more about the different type of trucks in this codex.
[23:39.38]Alright, well let's get it.
[23:45.36]Um... What's going on?
[23:51.14]Am I hitting this picnic table?
[24:00.95]Oh shit, I'm like buried in here.
[24:06.17]Alright.
[24:07.27]Turn on all-wheel drive.
[24:08.19]Slowly try to get out of this mud.
[24:09.61]That mud actually breaks apart physics underneath you.
[24:11.79]That's crazy.
[24:14.71]Why can I not go through this?
[24:15.65]I'm just digging myself a hole.
[24:18.75]Just go.
[24:23.23]I can't reverse.
[24:24.74]Why can I not reverse?
[24:34.77]Can I get out of the car?
[24:35.71]Okay, I have to tow it.
[24:38.68]Okay, winch.
[24:43.44]Let's attach the front to this truck here.
[24:46.50]Alright, let's go.
[24:49.12]Nice.
[24:50.96]Yes!
[24:51.29]Alright, I'm good.
[24:54.57]Take it off.
[24:56.65]How would I still be stuck right here?
[24:58.53]This is stupid.
[24:59.33]Don't hit the explosive barrel.
[25:02.37]I don't want to fuck that up.
[25:07.52]Alright, well, come on, just drive.
[25:09.16]Alright, alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[25:20.36]Now what?
[25:23.91]That was just the, that was just the, every commercial break return for Pawn Stars.
[25:29.07]Ah, I don't know what you're saying, Chumbly.
[25:33.58]No, no, not on my.
[25:35.07]I don't think any of you idiots know what you're doing in here.
[25:39.05]Pops, uh, Pops, we got this new thing.
[25:41.09]I don't care about that shit.
[25:42.37]Get that out of my store.
[25:45.75]Fucking idiot.
[25:52.98]Change the truck.
[25:53.56]Alright, well, how do I get in it?
[25:54.54]That was just Mitch McConnell.
[25:58.02]Alright, how about a change truck?
[26:00.14]Ooh.
[26:01.54]Oh, shit.
[26:02.00]Alright.
[26:06.65]Wait, can I save that truck somewhere?
[26:08.57]I don't want to drive this thing.
[26:09.81]Didn't they just say that this thing doesn't do off-road?
[26:13.83]Alright, I need a destination.
[26:18.23]Lumber mill?
[26:20.77]What's my... What is my actual goal?
[26:24.21]Old bridge reconstruction.
[26:25.27]Okay.
[26:26.15]I need to deliver two wooden planks.
[26:29.08]So we're going to get this one to the lumber mill.
[26:35.87]It does off-road if you push it down and hit the gas hard enough.
[26:41.69]While screaming.
[26:45.61]Alright, I need metal beams and wooden planks.
[26:50.27]Let's get the wooden planks.
[26:51.23]It's definitely here.
[26:55.29]To complete this contract, you need to do two objectives.
[26:57.45]They must be done in order.
[26:58.63]What?
[26:59.55]What are you talking about?
[27:03.45]They must be done in order.
[27:07.66]The one in the town is the storage facility.
[27:09.82]So this is storage.
[27:12.48]Where you'll be able to pick up the required cargo.
[27:14.50]The marker near the broken bridge indicates the delivery location.
[27:17.81]Let's go check out the town storage.
[27:21.69]What do you mean, go to the fucking town storage?
[27:23.75]I don't want to go to the town storage.
[27:25.71]I want to go to the lumber mill.
[27:26.71]Because that's where the wood is.
[27:31.20]Okay.
[27:32.56]We're going to go here.
[27:36.14]You have to do it in order.
[27:37.10]I don't like that.
[27:41.24]Let's go.
[27:43.57]I have to repair the bridge?
[27:48.95]This truck is able to transport two slots of cargo.
[27:51.42]Alright.
[28:08.15]Wait, this is much closer than I thought it was.
[28:11.25]Can I just get it?
[28:11.91]I don't... Why do I have to do it in order?
[28:16.02]I shouldn't have to do it in order.
[28:16.88]I'm not doing it in order.
[28:18.20]It's right here.
[28:19.50]Do the first, do it in order.
[28:21.36]Well, I don't want to do it in order!
[28:23.54]It's right here, this lumber, literally five millimeters away from me.
[28:32.35]Wait.
[28:33.85]Why is it...
[28:46.35]This thing is too big.
[28:47.38]Alright, I'll go this way.
[28:50.34]But the order, but the order of going.
[28:54.46]Alright, how much gas do I have?
[28:55.92]Alright, get this shit in all-wheel drive.
[28:59.22]Wait, there's no all-wheel drive.
[29:00.30]There isn't?
[29:05.47]This is so scary.
[29:13.23]It's got, it already has all-wheel drive, doesn't it?
[29:24.09]Alright, slow down.
[29:24.85]Don't be an idiot.
[29:29.62]It is safe.
[29:30.14]Okay, it auto-saves.
[29:31.00]That's good.
[29:31.56]Alright, metal beams and then two pieces of wood.
[29:36.94]This guy loves yard work and big trucks.
[29:39.98]I do.
[29:41.27]It's alright.
[29:41.69]I can run over some stuff in this PUBG neighborhood.
[29:44.03]I'll be fine.
[29:54.39]easy okay look they put like hazards oh no I thought that was a hole oh wait look at this can I drive this car can I change truck oh come on I can't drive this I can't drive the suv
[30:24.78]Why not?
[30:29.86]Everyone is dead.
[30:32.86]No, I think that... I don't know.
[30:34.44]Alright, I need to put in two pieces of metal.
[30:38.81]Cargo management.
[30:39.67]There are a couple ways to load a selected cargo.
[30:43.81]Automatic loading provides a simple and fast way of loading without the use of a crane.
[30:48.41]Alright.
[30:50.40]Easy.
[30:52.18]That's good.
[30:52.62]Alright, so how many metal beams?
[30:55.21]Load it up.
[30:56.91]Not enough space.
[30:57.43]Alright, well, I have enough.
[31:00.69]Cool.
[31:01.03]Alright, so now I'm going to bring this... Where am I bringing this?
[31:03.13]I have to bring this to the bridge.
[31:10.33]Where's the bridge?
[31:16.01]Fuel station, lumber mill.
[31:18.04]Here?
[31:18.28]I have to bring it here.
[31:19.44]Alright, get this off.
[31:31.10]It's on the map?
[31:33.40]Oh, shit.
[31:33.94]Okay, it's this one.
[31:35.68]That's so far away.
[31:36.64]Holy shit, that's so far away.
[31:40.32]Okay, well, whatever.
[31:41.02]Alright, I'm bringing it to the bridge.
[31:45.15]Just drive on the highway.
[31:53.51]You may attach trailers found out in the wilds and use them to your liking.
[31:57.51]Trailer attachments don't... Wait a minute.
[32:01.26]You may be unable to attach a variety of trailers.
[32:05.04]Just for reasons between distance, angle... Okay, wait a minute.
[32:07.40]So, hold on.
[32:07.82]Should I get the trailer and go get the wood?
[32:14.02]Oh, shit.
[32:14.46]Alright, yeah.
[32:14.80]That sounds like a good idea.
[32:15.46]Alright, where's the trailer?
[32:19.30]There it is.
[32:19.60]I need a gas station, too.
[32:33.17]What's already in here?
[32:33.99]Alright, I got a new trailer.
[32:36.55]How am I going to put this on?
[32:38.51]Can I pull it?
[32:46.54]Okay, I need to, like, get this... I need to move this.
[32:48.18]I'm going to try to move it.
[33:00.16]Good.
[33:00.34]I actually wanted to dump it anyways.
[33:01.60]Alright, so how do I...
[33:04.38]How do I take care of, um, hold on.
[33:05.82]I need to flip it.
[33:17.13]I think I may have fucked this up bad.
[33:24.55]Come on, pull it up.
[33:25.61]I need to get it up on its legs.
[33:29.75]Alright, here we go.
[33:34.14]How do I get it up?
[33:38.28]Okay.
[33:38.88]So now I'm going to attach the trailer.
[33:40.73]Attach trailer.
[33:43.23]Attach trailer.
[33:47.29]I can't.
[33:47.61]Okay.
[33:57.58]Attach trailer.
[33:59.22]No suitable trailer.
[34:02.61]Can I, like, flip this?
[34:04.05]I have to flip it.
[34:09.21]I have to flip it.
[34:09.81]I have to go back on it.
[34:10.57]I have to flip it.
[34:15.34]Got it.
[34:15.60]Alright.
[34:15.86]Good, good, good.
[34:16.40]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:17.80]God damn it.
[34:28.03]I'm gonna run aghast doing this.
[34:30.79]I actually flipped it.
[34:37.32]Hold on.
[34:38.96]Attach to here.
[34:41.48]Let's go.
[34:41.76]Flip it.
[34:45.48]Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[34:48.20]I'm good.
[34:48.86]I got it.
[34:50.96]I now attach this damn thing.
[34:54.00]See, we're fine.
[34:54.70]Everyone relax.
[34:56.84]Grailer attached.
[34:58.92]Go.
[35:03.04]Although, wait, this is going to be hard to do.
[35:08.96]Should I get gas?
[35:12.24]What the hell am I doing?
[35:12.98]I'm going to get lumber.
[35:13.92]Alright, now we're going to go to the lumber yard.
[35:16.22]Turn this off.
[35:19.57]This game's pretty cool.
[35:20.53]I like this.
[35:21.37]This is fun.
[35:21.83]Alright, let's go get the lumber over here.
[35:25.93]This is fun.
[35:30.95]I have to drive slow though because it's pulling me in both directions.
[35:42.03]Slow.
[35:43.95]I got a big load here.
[35:44.87]You know, every time I ever saw somebody at an intersection, like a big truck, take these turns, I always imagine, like, oh, it's a red light, or they have, like, a left arrow, and here they are taking the turn.
[35:58.05]I always feel like the person in that car is just, like, pursing their lips, going like, fuck, fuck.
[36:04.75]Like, screaming.
[36:07.15]Every time.
[36:22.49]And doesn't it always kind of feel like that they're about to hit you too?
[36:28.17]Like, I just, the truck just comes all the way across.
[36:30.92]You're sitting there at the light and it just goes across your car.
[36:33.68]You're like, holy shit, how can you do this?
[36:35.88]How is it possible that you can even, how?
[36:38.46]I'm almost at 700,000 followers.
[36:53.60]Holy shit, that's way more than I had like a month ago.
[36:59.22]Hey, thanks for the follows.
[37:01.00]Really appreciate it.
[37:03.08]Thanks for joining the stream.
[37:06.45]Yeah, you, I'm talking to you.
[37:07.91]Thank you.
[37:11.79]Alright, let's fill this up.
[37:14.43]I need two pieces of lumber.
[37:20.72]Alright, let's go.
[37:21.30]Wooden planks.
[37:21.82]I need two out of two.
[37:22.68]Put them into the trailer.
[37:24.65]Load it up.
[37:25.95]One.
[37:26.63]Two.
[37:27.11]Alright, I'm good.
[37:30.05]I have a... This is really heavy now, though.
[37:33.65]This could be a disaster.
[37:35.27]Alright, hold on.
[37:37.15]Now, look at this.
[37:37.75]I got a road right here.
[37:39.49]It's just a straightaway right here.
[37:40.91]Don't do anything stupid.
[37:41.81]Don't be like, oh, look at this.
[37:44.17]And it's driving to the water.
[37:45.82]I know you want to.
[37:46.54]No.
[37:50.89]It says go that way.
[37:52.03]I'm not driving the fucking water.
[37:55.49]I didn't know.
[37:56.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37:58.41]Hold on.
[37:59.69]I'm not going to fuck this up.
[38:02.25]We're going to do this the right way.
[38:04.39]See?
[38:04.85]Okay.
[38:09.09]It's not the right.
[38:10.19]It's not what I was doing, but okay.
[38:16.14]Alright.
[38:16.50]Pull this back.
[38:18.22]I got to give myself a route.
[38:21.47]No, clear it.
[38:24.53]Clear, alright.
[38:29.63]No, this way.
[38:31.77]I'll get the gist of it when I get here, whatever.
[38:34.92]Okay, there's the route, let's do it.
[38:38.32]When are you going to show us your disfigured face?
[38:40.70]How about now?
[38:56.37]Alright, I'll give you a facecam for this part.
[38:58.72]That's it.
[39:05.58]No, I don't do facecam.
[39:06.82]Unless I have to.
[39:09.50]Alright, here we go.
[39:15.84]Am I well lit?
[39:16.70]I can't... I don't know.
[39:17.44]I can't even tell.
[39:17.96]Ew.
[39:24.19]Hold on.
[39:24.73]I gotta get some blood flow to my eyes and cheeks.
[39:27.05]Okay.
[39:31.79]There.
[39:34.22]Okay.
[39:36.18]Be careful.
[39:41.56]See, this is why I can't do face cam.
[39:42.74]Because I'm just like, what do I look like right now?
[39:44.98]What do I look like right now?
[39:46.98]Oh, I have to play a game.
[39:47.60]What do I look like right now?
[39:48.84]No, I hate it.
[39:49.62]It distracts me.
[40:03.24]Oh shit.
[40:03.76]Okay, hold on.
[40:04.32]I think I have enough gas to do this first mission.
[40:17.15]Don't go too fast.
[40:18.03]I'm gonna like flip this thing.
[40:24.95]Is that water?
[40:25.55]No.
[40:26.97]Can this stuff fall out or is it attached?
[40:28.74]It looks like it's attached by the bungees or something.
[40:37.52]Stop looking!
[40:38.38]I gotta stop looking over here!
[40:47.11]Game just crashed.
[40:47.84]No, we're good.
[40:48.18]Okay, if you and I were in a fight... Like...
[40:55.64]I pull out a knife, and you pull out like a sword, and we're like about to fight to the death.
[41:00.26]Put the weapon down, put it down.
[41:01.98]Just hold a mirror up, like over here.
[41:04.84]Just hold up a mirror.
[41:06.40]And like, you could have like a fist or a knife in the other hand, whatever you want.
[41:09.88]As long as there's a mirror here, and we're like jumping around and dancing around, I'm gonna be like... Ow!
[41:17.79]Like... Like fighting.
[41:19.83]What about me in the mirror?
[41:21.01]That's what I look like.
[41:22.73]That's my weakness.
[41:25.45]You'll win every single time.
[41:30.07]Uh, wait a minute.
[41:31.15]I don't know about this part.
[41:37.98]Can you tell how deep the water is?
[41:40.88]Why does it say I have zero out of one metal beams?
[41:46.64]Should I just go for it?
[41:47.28]Alright, I'm just going to go for it.
[41:55.74]It'll just cover a room with mirrors.
[41:58.02]I will forget that I was fighting you, and I'll start, like, punching myself in the mirror.
[42:14.13]We're good.
[42:14.43]If you attach a trailer, you should approach it- What do you mean, attach a trailer?
[42:26.86]Is there another one?
[42:32.31]Is there another trailer here?
[42:36.65]No.
[42:38.01]Why would they show me that?
[42:43.08]I'm not making a choo-choo train.
[42:44.78]Not right now.
[42:55.37]Turn the hints off.
[42:56.27]Well, I might, I might need them.
[43:01.71]Alright, this looks like, this is getting narrow.
[43:03.22]Hold on.
[43:03.80]I gotta focus.
[43:06.06]My game seems like crashing.
[43:08.86]Oh, 30, 90, 30, 90.
[43:10.28]Okay, now we bang a left here, right?
[43:19.05]Come on, you can make it.
[43:21.19]It's getting to be nighttime.
[43:40.47]You see that?
[43:41.07]I was just taking a left.
[43:42.39]I was just taking a left at the intersection.
[43:44.53]That's what they do.
[43:46.09]They're like, oh, shit.
[43:50.53]Fuck, what do I do?
[43:52.34]How do I get out of this?
[43:55.62]It's this goddamn mirror.
[43:57.50]I don't want the mirror anymore.
[43:59.22]It's the mirror.
[44:01.86]Can I attach it to this?
[44:02.72]Wait, hold on.
[44:14.38]Recover vehicle to start zone.
[44:15.82]What?
[44:16.12]Can I push?
[44:30.85]Cargo will be lost.
[44:32.07]Oh, come on.
[44:33.35]No.
[44:36.61]You can't blame everything on drugs and mirrors.
[44:44.94]Okay, well, I'm gonna... What if I just quit the game?
[44:50.44]Oh, let me attach the trailer.
[44:51.54]Trailer's too far away.
[44:53.46]God damn it.
[44:54.28]I have to do the whole thing again.
[44:57.03]Change truck?
[44:58.97]Fuck.
[44:59.83]How?
[45:01.09]Whatever.
[45:02.93]Roof cover vehicle?
[45:05.66]Why did I detach the thing?
[45:07.40]Why?
[45:13.18]Use the winch?
[45:13.74]I can't use the winch.
[45:14.90]It broke.
[45:18.40]What has the most damage?
[45:19.28]This thing is fine.
[45:20.22]I just need to flip it.
[45:21.07]Can I flip it somehow?
[45:22.29]I'm just going to reload.
[45:30.55]Truck recovery.
[45:31.27]Go on.
[45:31.81]Whatever.
[45:32.13]Okay.
[45:32.87]Great.
[45:33.83]This is fantastic.
[45:36.53]Oh my god.
[45:37.27]I have to do the whole thing again.
[45:45.16]Alright.
[45:45.56]No, don't fuck this up this time.
[45:48.96]Doesn't matter.
[45:49.36]I don't have to do it in order.
[45:50.38]Let's go.
[45:50.84]Alright.

[46:50.95]Wait, hold on a second.
[46:54.33]I can skip this.
[46:55.47]I don't have to go to the lumber mill.
[46:57.67]Alright, don't go to the lumber mill.
[47:01.01]I can go reclaim everything.
[47:02.19]Alright, that's fine.
[47:02.86]Let's go.

[47:16.72]Wait, what are you guys saying?
[47:26.15]You don't have a crane.
[47:28.41]What do you mean?
[47:28.99]Wait, I have to go get the lumber stuff because I don't have a crane?
[47:33.26]Oh, for the love of God.

[47:59.26]Skip time.
[47:59.74]Morning.
[48:00.02]There we go.
[48:01.54]Now I can see.
[48:02.08]Let's do this again.
[48:12.63]You might be able to put a crane on the truck.
[48:14.05]Alright, let's get the lumber.
[48:17.79]No, no, this is wrong.
[48:19.17]Because I need to get the... Alright, I have to get a trailer.
[48:24.13]There's two of those, but I need the... Hold on a second.
[48:35.18]I need the trailer because I need to bring... I can't... I got to bring the trailer up there.
[48:37.84]Wait, there's a trailer up there.
[48:38.68]Yeah, there is.
[48:39.04]Okay.
[48:39.14]Okay.
[48:44.16]Where the metal is, there's a trailer up there.
[48:50.91]Imagine what your boss thinks about this, Omega Lo.
[48:53.72]That doesn't matter to me.
[48:55.52]I'm my own boss.
[49:13.20]When was the last time you smoked a crack pipe?
[49:15.92]I've never smoked a crack pipe.
[49:18.07]In my life, ever.
[49:19.23]So, none.
[49:20.91]Not, no, never.
[49:24.76]My own bots.
[49:27.00]I don't want to run out of gas, that's important.
[49:45.41]No, no drugs.
[49:51.19]Drug free.
[49:52.61]No face cam, no food.
[49:57.96]I'm gonna be alright.
[50:01.18]Okay.
[50:02.74]I will now give you exactly five minutes of face cam.
[50:07.90]Starting now.
[50:14.68]I fucking can't be trusted, I really can't.
[50:17.94]What's over here?
[50:18.42]Alright, the trailer's right there.
[50:21.72]Go get the trailer.
[50:29.10]Where's this trailer?
[50:32.49]This fucking cameraman!
[50:34.15]Like, oh stop!
[50:35.77]Who's flying the drone around the car?
[50:37.93]Just stay here!
[50:38.67]Alright.
[50:43.65]Is this it?
[50:47.22]New trailer.
[50:47.66]This thing's huge!
[50:52.60]This thing is gigantic!
[50:54.63]Alright, that just went into the windshield and I get the guy in the head.
[50:59.57]Attached trailer?
[51:01.75]Oh my god, it's too big!
[51:03.65]How?
[51:06.27]How do I do this?
[51:07.98]What is this even attached to?
[51:17.15]Do I have to... But I have cargo.
[51:18.90]This is... I don't... This is bad.
[51:24.26]This is the wrong truck.
[51:25.42]I can't handle this.
[51:26.26]Oh, for the love of God.
[51:28.65]Are you serious?
[51:34.53]Oh, shit.
[51:35.31]So, I need to go...
[51:40.42]get a different trailer.
[51:42.33]So I have to go recover this trailer down here?
[51:45.52]Is what you're saying?
[52:12.67]I don't think I can, this is, no this is stupid, just drive.
[52:19.75]Just drive.
[52:20.93]Don't run over this person's pool.
[52:25.91]Why is there a pool made out of concrete?
[52:29.49]Why is there a pool made out of a tree stump?
[52:32.52]What?
[52:35.76]Why is there a concrete pool in your front yard?
[52:41.54]I can't, I, so you're saying I can't put this trailer on my, my thing here?
[52:44.78]Alright, can I, I'm just gonna, can I just drop this off at the bridge and come back?
[52:55.60]Alright, let's think about this logically.
[53:03.61]There is, I need to get the metal here.
[53:07.51]So what I'm gonna do...
[53:10.72]There's wood down here.
[53:17.07]Can I get a crane?
[53:19.51]What do you think?
[53:21.69]Just take two trips, my man.
[53:23.25]I... It said I had to do it in order.
[53:33.91]La la waiting war... Whatever.
[53:39.01]But I have to do it in order.
[53:45.49]Remember, most pools are made of concrete.
[53:47.18]Not an above-ground pool in your front yard.
[53:49.52]Above-ground pools are not made out of concrete.
[53:55.05]Dump the planks?
[53:55.63]Alright, yeah.
[53:56.03]Alright.
[53:56.55]I'm gonna dump the planks and- Alright, fuck it.
[53:58.19]We're doing two trips.
[53:58.93]I don't care.
[54:12.21]What is it supposed to be made of?
[54:13.17]I don't know.
[54:14.09]It's like a plastic, like, bendy, flat polymer thing.
[54:17.92]I don't know.
[54:18.30]It's not concrete.
[54:20.78]It's made out of, like, a hard, weird, like, polyurethane plastic.
[54:26.46]I don't know.
[54:26.92]It's made out of something that's not metal.
[54:30.11]It's like plastic.
[54:31.93]An above-ground pool.
[54:32.91]What is it made out of?
[54:33.49]I'm going to look it up right now.
[54:36.41]What's an above-ground pool made out of?
[54:47.26]Above ground proof is made out of steel, aluminum, and resin.
[54:51.04]Okay?
[54:51.28]It's made out of resin.
[54:53.58]Here are the advantages and disadvantages.
[54:54.62]It's resin.
[54:55.48]It's made out of resin.
[54:57.47]I don't know what resin is.
[54:58.31]I just know it's a thing that can be made out of stuff.
[55:11.39]Resin is concrete.
[55:12.53]Resin is not concrete.
[55:15.19]Resin is like the shit that comes out of fucking plant sap.
[55:18.47]Resin is the stuff that with like a tree like has like the sap coming out of it.
[55:21.45]That's what resin is.
[55:34.24]That's wrong.
[55:34.78]It's not wrong.
[55:35.36]Alright.
[55:37.56]Here we go.
[55:40.45]Cargo management.
[55:41.31]Let's go.
[55:41.73]I need metal beams.
[55:42.91]I need to unload this shit.
[55:46.31]How do I unload?
[55:52.57]Unpack cargo.
[55:53.39]Okay, unpack cargo.
[55:58.46]How do I unpack the cargo?
[56:03.74]Unpack cargo!
[56:04.56]I don't want to remove the cargo, I want to unpack it.
[56:20.11]That's exactly what I didn't want to do!
[56:28.74]I'm gonna be alright.
[56:30.52]Everything's fine.
[56:36.86]Fuck it.
[56:37.10]Whatever.
[56:37.40]I don't even care.
[56:37.94]Let's go.
[56:38.58]Cargo management.
[56:39.16]Give me the metal.
[56:40.10]Let's go.
[56:40.68]Okay.
[56:41.04]Alright.
[56:41.32]Bye.
[56:41.44]Let's go.
[56:42.06]Go.
[56:42.46]Go.
[56:42.96]Go.
[56:43.44]Go.
[56:44.28]Don't drive into a wall!
[56:59.24]Trees have a- Resin has trees in it, right?
[57:01.23]Other way around, you know what I mean?
[57:03.01]Say what I said backwards.
[57:05.07]There's tree resin, right?
[57:12.51]Five minutes are up, by the way.
[57:20.84]What?
[57:21.26]It's- This thing is pulling to the left.
[57:23.54]I'm not doing that.
[57:25.42]Oh, wait.
[57:25.90]It's like a real car.
[57:26.52]You have to actually change the wheel before you go anywhere.
[57:31.12]This dude's a muppet muppet streamer.
[57:35.63]I'm just gonna do it one at a time.
[57:36.99]Ooh la la.
[57:45.99]No!
[57:46.61]You did- Give it a rest, that was that.
[57:51.39]Just drive, please.
[57:52.44]I'm ju-
[57:59.14]La la.
[58:00.76]La la la.
[58:04.33]I refuse to do that with the camera on because I find it embarrassing.
[58:11.57]I need to refuel though.
[58:16.72]I'm driving this car like there's a bunch of bees in it.
[58:20.48]Can I please straighten out?
[58:21.70]Alright, refuel.
[58:35.97]Anytime there's a bug in the car, like a wasp or a bee or something, you kind of just have that freak out mode where you roll down every single window in the car and scream.
[58:44.12]And just stay still.
[58:44.76]You just hope that it's like, and he just goes out the window.
[58:54.93]I can make that, right?
[59:07.27]Alright, I'm almost at that point.
[59:08.65]Can I lift this up?
[59:09.85]I'm going to do a test here.
[59:16.60]Okay.
[59:18.52]This is where the catastrophe started.
[59:20.80]Can I do anything about this?
[59:25.44]Stop.
[59:25.80]Stop moving.
[59:26.71]Stop moving.
[59:27.35]Stop moving.
[59:27.87]Stop moving.
[59:28.37]Stop moving.
[59:38.63]Fall in there again.
[59:40.01]Nope.
[59:40.61]Not gonna happen.
[59:42.59]Oh, handbrake.
[59:43.19]Okay.
[59:46.25]Wait.
[59:46.71]Let go of it.
[59:49.96]Can I attach it to the... I can attach it to the... Here we go.
[59:54.24]Right there.
[59:54.86]Pull it.
[60:02.84]Come on.
[60:08.75]What?
[60:11.01]Oh, it's the fucking pole.
[60:12.21]Give me a break.
[60:20.62]Flip it.
[60:22.34]No, no, no.
[60:23.22]At least get it out of the... Get it away from that thing.
[60:25.68]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[60:34.02]It's flipped.
[60:34.36]I flipped it.
[60:36.26]Let it go.
[60:37.56]Okay.
[60:37.68]Okay.
[60:51.59]Uh... I feel like this is probably too dangerous.
[60:58.41]I'm gonna deliver this first.
[60:59.41]I'm not fucking around.
[61:01.56]I'm not gonna do this now.
[61:02.62]Alright, here's the bridge.
[61:15.07]How do I do this?
[61:15.61]Do I just drive up and it just does it automatically?
[61:24.01]Okay, nice.
[61:27.08]Cargo management.
[61:29.22]When unloading the cargo, you may be presented with different unloading options as one cargo may be used to complete different objectives.
[61:36.02]While the cargo, while the current unloading area is used only to complete your current job, there may be others that are used in multiple contracts.
[61:45.13]Okay, unload.
[61:49.83]Nice.
[61:54.19]The bridge is on its way, but not there yet.
[61:55.55]You need to deliver more.
[61:59.10]Lumber mill.
[62:00.18]Okay.
[62:01.50]Nice.
[62:02.36]Thank you.
[62:04.26]I was about to step on the gas and just drive off and just watch chat.
[62:08.68]No.
[62:09.14]It's too early for that.
[62:09.87]I have to do a fall joke.
[62:18.71]Can I just pick these up?
[62:20.35]I don't have a crane.
[62:21.03]Somebody said I need a crane.
[62:27.59]You gotta hit that yoinky splinky.
[62:36.42]Just recover, you're gonna spawn next to the lumber mill.
[62:40.62]Well, let me just see if I can even do this.
[62:41.88]Because if I can, that's good.
[62:48.88]Can I just go next to this and... Wait, can I just attach the winch to this?
[62:52.74]Just drag it?
[62:54.00]I probably can.
[62:55.46]Why wouldn't I?
[62:56.75]Right?
[63:01.36]Oh, what the hell?
[63:02.06]Really?
[63:08.06]Okay.
[63:10.09]Remove cargo.
[63:10.87]No.
[63:14.43]It's the new hot TikTok dance.
[63:15.93]The Yoinkish Planky.
[63:20.03]This is way too dangerous.
[63:27.56]Yeah, it's too dangerous.
[63:29.40]I'm just gonna go get it.
[63:30.66]I don't care.
[63:32.34]I need to complete level one.
[63:33.60]You know what I mean?
[63:50.64]I love how he just ignores you all.
[63:54.07]You gotta hit that Yoinky Splinky.
[63:55.63]I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[63:57.92]What is a Yoinky Splinky?
[64:04.22]Um... That... The Yoinky Splinky is somebody's legs behind their head?
[64:08.25]Like, moving... What was that?
[64:33.51]What a virgin.
[64:34.55]What?
[64:34.87]What are you talking about?
[64:40.01]This dude doesn't know the yoinky-splinky.
[64:48.82]Ah, what a virgin.
[64:49.98]Is this the lumber mill?
[64:54.56]Alright.
[64:55.02]Yes.
[64:57.58]Why does he keep reading the worst comments?
[64:59.80]I'm not.
[65:06.60]He's pretending, right?
[65:07.33]He actually knows what it is.
[65:08.29]I don't really.
[65:10.05]Alright, lumber mill.
[65:12.43]Let's go.
[65:13.79]And look!
[65:14.43]Perfectly loaded lumber.
[65:16.93]Although, I'm just gonna say fuck it and just do this.
[65:18.39]Alright.
[65:25.88]Cargo.
[65:26.28]I need wooden plank, wooden plank.
[65:28.82]Let's go.
[65:29.38]Done.
[65:35.77]Move.
[65:50.27]This is Know Your Meme page for the Yankee Splanky.
[65:56.23]I don't know.
[65:57.37]I'm not.
[65:57.73]Alright.
[65:57.99]I'm going to move on because I don't know.
[65:59.77]Nor do I need to put that much more time into knowing what this is.
[66:02.45]You know what I'm saying?
[66:05.55]I'm just saying.
[66:11.66]That's been in my head for like a month.
[66:13.16]I don't know why.
[66:16.62]That just keeps jumping in.
[66:17.74]I don't know how.
[66:22.46]I don't know.
[66:28.60]What setting am I on?
[66:29.98]Um... I... Just normal?
[66:34.01]A career mode, I think?
[66:35.05]I don't know.
[66:40.09]Alright, we're almost done with level one.
[66:43.99]And then I'm gonna unlock, hopefully, the ice level.
[66:51.56]It's low down here.
[66:52.10]I don't want to blow it here.
[66:52.78]Part of me just wants to take a left and just drive.
[67:04.89]No, that goes under the bridge.
[67:06.05]Why would I do that?
[67:07.03]I was about to do it.
[67:09.47]Or just driven into the water.
[67:10.65]That would have been a disaster.
[67:19.66]Okay.
[67:20.68]Very good.
[67:22.04]Learn the- NOT AGAIN!
[67:25.73]That turn is fucked.
[67:26.85]It is.
[67:27.09]That turn comes up on you hard and it just dumps you if you don't do it right.
[67:36.18]We're good.
[67:49.56]I'm concerned about how you drive in real life.
[67:51.66]I don't have a class truck license.
[67:55.66]And I'm using my left thumb to drive a car.
[67:59.44]This is not how you drive a real car.
[68:13.23]Alright, so now what?
[68:14.03]I got promoted.
[68:20.29]I just think- I just see that guy's face.
[68:21.77]I just- I just think of the- the Pawn Stars guy.
[68:25.89]Now let me change it.
[68:26.97]That guy.
[68:27.81]Every time.
[68:28.29]He just keeps popping in my head with like a hat on.
[68:29.79]Alright, when you get enough experience, you can get a new driver rank.
[68:34.02]Every rank provides you with new options regarding vehicle and add-on purchasing.
[68:37.70]Cool.
[68:38.92]Objectives may also require you to reach a certain driver rank before they are unlocked.
[68:41.86]Press down to access your driver profile.
[68:48.64]Oh, now I can leave the peninsula and reach the garage.
[68:51.82]Nice.
[68:52.22]Oh, I got 2,100 bucks.
[68:52.84]Nice.
[68:54.64]Every contract completed will provide you with money and experience points.
[68:58.43]Every watchtower discovered will reward you with experience.
[69:00.59]XP allows you to unlock new driver ranks.
[69:03.13]Cool.
[69:03.33]Alright.
[69:04.55]Nice.
[69:04.79]Let's go.
[69:09.53]Time to find the garage.
[69:10.33]It's now marked on the map.
[69:13.32]My driver ranks.
[69:15.18]I'm never going to change that profile picture ever.
[69:20.20]That was the please don't recognize me in Team Fortress 2 avatar.
[69:26.95]Uh, this is your driver profile.
[69:29.97]You can learn a lot of useful information about your progress here.
[69:35.13]Cool.
[69:35.99]Yeah.
[69:36.37]There's 89 missions in this game?
[69:38.17]Holy shit.
[69:40.49]Alright, let's go to the, uh, garage.
[69:43.64]Yup.
[69:44.36]Okay.
[69:45.90]He hates his fans.
[69:47.24]No!
[69:49.80]No, when I used to play TF2 and make TF2 videos, I wanted to make sure that I was at the same exact level as everybody else.
[69:57.71]So if my name was Jerma985 and I was like, Hey guys, it's me, Jerma985!
[70:03.53]Two people on the other team would switch to spy.
[70:04.81]There'd be three snipers that were just aiming for my head.
[70:08.09]Six people would just stand at the spawn holding their hand in the air.
[70:11.28]And it wouldn't even be a game of Team Fortress anymore.
[70:14.19]So when I was hiding, I was just another player.
[70:17.59]So it was just completely... Nobody knew.
[70:19.83]It was just, that's a guy on the other team.
[70:23.34]I didn't want to, like, fuck up games.
[70:24.76]You know what I mean?
[70:26.60]I didn't want to go in there and, like, there's a whole game going on and be like, Everybody, it's me.
[70:30.18]I'm here.
[70:31.92]Where's the line of people?
[70:33.64]Where... I'm in the server now.
[70:35.66]Hello.
[70:36.00]No, my name was, like, Dogshit Burrito and I had, like...
[70:43.73]Like weird avatars that weren't connected to me at all.
[70:51.40]He's a celebrity.
[70:52.46]Oh, look at me.
[70:53.10]He's a celebrity.
[70:54.48]No, that's not what I'm saying.
[70:55.54]Ooh, watchtower.
[71:01.09]Ooh, look at this celebrity.
[71:02.33]No, I'm not a celebrity.
[71:15.05]You're too important to play TF2.
[71:17.09]That's not even what I'm saying.
[71:21.07]Oh, fuck.
[71:21.69]I'm stuck.
[71:26.21]I should have paid attention.
[71:26.85]Can I get out?
[71:29.77]I'm not going this way.
[71:38.80]Where's the winch connected to?
[71:49.53]Get me out.
[71:55.96]I'm buried in this mud.
[71:57.30]I can't go anywhere.
[72:02.38]Shit.
[72:04.53]What do I do?
[72:04.99]Well, how was I supposed to know there was this weird terrain over here?
[72:08.99]Low gear.
[72:13.03]Alright, we're just going in it.
[72:17.44]Come on.
[72:18.36]Just dig through it.
[72:19.44]Just dig.
[72:20.02]Jeremy, is it true that you sharted when you jumped through the window?
[72:25.08]Yes.
[72:25.28]I'm just going to give you that one.
[72:28.50]You probably just started laughing.
[72:29.85]You're probably like, why did he even respond to that?
[72:32.99]What the fuck?
[72:34.09]Alright, I'm stuck again.
[72:34.85]Alright, now I'm going to attach a winch to something over here.
[72:45.35]Yep.
[72:46.65]Go.
[72:46.73]Go.
[72:53.08]Pull me.
[72:55.06]Pull me through the mud.
[72:56.08]Come on.
[72:59.73]Alright, now winch something else.
[73:01.47]Handbrake.
[73:05.39]Right there.
[73:05.73]Let's go.
[73:09.81]This was a huge mistake coming down here.
[73:17.59]Come on.
[73:18.17]Come on.
[73:18.49]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[73:19.59]Stop.
[73:20.15]I don't want to screw this up.
[73:21.43]I probably shouldn't even drive down this.
[73:24.23]Wait.
[73:25.19]Can I go that way?
[73:25.89]Alright, I'm gonna go across this way.
[73:38.19]That should get me at least over here.
[73:39.27]I don't want to drive through the mud.
[73:43.31]This car can't go through the mud.
[73:52.11]But I can't go through this either.
[73:55.12]What the fuck?
[73:55.78]What?
[73:57.95]What do you mean?
[73:58.39]This is so wet over here.
[74:03.45]Can I not go here?
[74:08.11]It's so wet over here.
[74:09.09]Is there another car?
[74:16.94]It's still mud.
[74:18.12]Oh.
[74:18.54]Well, I think I'll be alright.
[74:19.34]I can just pull myself.
[74:25.59]Alright, I'm going to stay in low gear.
[74:26.67]Let's just stay on the road, maybe?
[74:27.85]Yeah, this one's not deep.
[74:36.69]I should be okay.
[74:39.35]There's water here, though.
[74:40.35]Oh, God.
[74:40.83]Don't drive through that.
[74:42.13]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[74:43.59]What is that?
[74:45.68]That's deep mud over there.
[74:48.30]I think I just screwed myself completely.
[74:55.25]Do I have to just go for it?
[74:56.73]I have to turn around.
[75:01.31]Oh my god.
[75:01.95]Give me a break.
[75:02.61]Really?
[75:04.93]Can I just get out of the car and sprint?
[75:08.35]Drive through or no balls.
[75:10.65]Full send.
[75:11.33]Full send.
[75:11.91]Yeah, alright.
[75:13.45]Let's laugh about the fact that I have to start over again.
[75:17.15]Where's the garage?
[75:21.71]Okay.
[75:21.95]Okay.
[75:24.66]It's right here.
[75:25.72]Come on.
[76:01.22]Go right.
[76:02.92]How deep is this?
[76:03.60]This water's not deep at all.
[76:04.92]Hold on.
[76:05.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[76:06.08]I'm alright.
[76:06.41]Okay.
[76:24.03]I'm so close to just touching this.
[76:25.33]I just want to touch it.
[76:25.91]There it is.
[76:28.15]I... No.
[76:36.00]Look it.
[76:36.32]I'm gonna be alright.
[76:37.24]Check this out.
[76:37.83]I'm gonna get up here.
[76:47.97]What in God's name are you doing?
[76:50.76]I'm trying to get close enough where I can just drive into this and activate the fucking watchtower.
[76:55.92]Swamp joke.
[76:56.80]It's not a swamp joke.
[77:16.57]Stop pretending.
[77:17.31]There's nothing to... There's nothing to pretend.
[77:19.60]Okay.
[77:23.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[77:24.12]Hold on.
[77:24.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[77:24.62]I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna...
[77:41.78]Okay, now that's exactly what I wanted to do.
[77:45.78]And everybody thought I was fucking stupid.
[78:03.57]Everybody thought I was an idiot.
[78:08.16]I'll show you in just a moment.
[78:09.96]You'll know very quickly here.
[78:26.98]Thank you.
[78:28.94]Thank you.
[78:30.72]Oh, what's that?
[78:31.28]Uh, thank you.
[78:38.43]Thank you.
[78:46.69]Thank you.
[78:53.88]Hold on.
[78:58.33]Dude, let's go.
[79:05.25]Just get me out of the water.
[79:06.13]I just have to touch this and I'll be fine.
[79:10.69]I'm not even in the water anymore.
[79:12.01]This is so stupid.
[79:24.18]There we go.
[79:24.80]Got it.
[79:26.40]I want you to, I want every single person that said, I want you to go through the logs and find everyone that said he's gonna get stuck in the water, fucking idiot.
[79:32.52]He sucks, he's so stupid, he sucks at everything.
[79:34.58]And I want those people to be timed out for exactly one second.
[80:07.61]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[80:19.23]I'll be fine.
[80:19.63]Hold on.
[80:27.31]The laws of physics.
[80:29.51]I'm a physics major.
[80:32.44]Just to get far enough over here.
[80:35.27]This sucks, Jerva.
[80:36.41]Stop!
[80:36.97]I'm fine.
[80:37.51]This sucks.
[80:42.22]I just have to touch this and I'm going to reset.
[80:45.02]I almost had a gas.
[80:50.24]Alright, come on.
[80:52.99]Oh my god.
[80:54.01]I can't move without just winching myself.
[80:56.65]This is bad.
[80:57.33]This is actually pretty bad.
[81:05.27]Can I get close enough to be able to attach to that?
[81:15.11]I'm almost there.
[81:16.17]Look at how close I am.
[81:18.11]See the- I can attach the winch up here.
[81:21.02]Come on, dude.
[81:21.64]Let's go.
[81:22.00]Yes!
[81:23.34]Yes!
[81:41.54]Alright.
[81:47.48]Let's go.
[81:57.70]I just made so much more work for myself.
[81:59.24]That was so stupid.
[82:00.00]Pull me!
[82:06.25]Just pull me in!
[82:07.07]Pull me in!
[82:07.59]Pull me in!
[82:08.05]Pull me in!
[82:08.53]Pull me in!
[82:09.47]Yes!
[82:10.19]Touchdown!
[82:13.00]Watchtower updated!
[82:15.39]Yes!
[82:23.21]There it is.
[82:26.49]And... There- I just have to get on the road.
[82:29.86]I- I probably have to go back.
[82:34.00]Arm.
[82:35.48]In the garage- alright.
[82:36.16]I need to- I gotta get a different car.
[82:39.62]Can I actually get out of here though?
[82:40.52]I might be able to.
[82:41.66]No.
[82:42.04]Nope.
[82:42.62]Goodbye.
[82:42.86]I'm just gonna... Yeah, I'm just gonna recover the car.
[82:50.54]Look at that.
[82:50.84]Take a look at that shit.
[82:56.20]Change the truck.
[82:57.98]Thank you.
[82:58.64]Let's go.
[83:09.35]Wait, can I attach to this?
[83:18.05]Wait.
[83:21.29]Holy shit.
[83:22.37]Okay.
[83:28.74]I should just... I can take them both.
[83:38.02]Alright, don't be an idiot.
[83:40.36]I'm going to change.
[83:40.96]Let's change to the truck.
[83:42.62]Yeah, I'll just bring it with me.
[83:46.87]Now, let me... Can I attach it?
[83:47.91]Okay, how about attach trailer?
[83:51.77]No, so... Okay.
[83:53.37]Alright.
[83:55.47]Attach winch.
[83:58.82]To here.
[84:00.48]And we're just going to pull it.
[84:02.64]What's going on?
[84:07.58]Why can't I drive?
[84:09.71]Load the truck onto the other truck.
[84:11.15]I don't think I can do that.
[84:11.93]Oh, I still have handbrake on.
[84:16.20]Alright, let's go.
[84:31.74]Now I need a good route here.
[84:33.16]Oh, shit.
[84:34.68]I got to go all the way down here.
[84:39.38]God damn it.
[84:40.62]Okay, let's get to here first.
[84:41.75]Two trucks, yes.
[84:57.54]I'm thinking of just abandoning this and just getting in the goddamn truck.
[85:12.98]Don't you have a face cam?
[85:13.82]Good call.
[85:20.86]Because if I ever get in trouble, then I can just switch to the other truck and just fuck off.
[85:24.85]It's simple.
[85:27.33]Simple.
[85:33.57]Yellow shirt.
[85:35.59]Yeah, I never usually wear yellow.
[85:37.07]You're right.
[85:40.10]I'm a blue, gray, dark, purple, black.
[85:45.02]My shirts are usually kind of in that zone.
[85:48.31]Sometimes red.
[85:50.09]Sometimes.
[85:50.47]Hope we can make this.
[85:54.93]We can.
[85:55.29]Good.
[86:00.82]Blue.
[86:01.30]Yeah, a lot of blue.
[86:02.72]I love blue.
[86:14.60]I'm running out of gas.
[86:17.62]Don't touch your hair.
[86:23.37]Where's another fuel station?
[86:27.97]Oh shit, there's a watchtower here.
[86:29.23]There's not another gas station anywhere.
[86:34.65]Should I fuel up or just say fuck it and just go?
[86:43.96]I feel like I probably should get gas, but I'm not going to.
[86:46.90]Whatever.
[86:50.26]Should I?
[86:52.98]It is just right here.
[86:54.04]I'm going to get it.
[86:54.58]It'd be dumb to not get it.
[86:57.26]Yeah, it's right here.
[87:09.00]Don't drive over the edge.
[87:09.80]You're going to be stranded if you don't get gas.
[87:16.21]Why don't you go to the garage?
[87:17.15]And that was the plan before, and then I went into the swamp accidentally.
[87:24.21]It was water here?
[87:24.87]Since when?
[87:29.47]Oh god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[87:37.80]That's not, is that fucking up that truck?
[87:48.29]Oh, shit.
[87:48.91]Like, water is just going into that car.
[87:57.78]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[87:58.80]Change, change, change, change, change, change, change.
[87:59.98]Okay.
[88:06.94]Here we go.
[88:22.88]No!
[88:24.34]Okay, fuck.
[88:25.12]I don't want to do that.
[88:26.58]Alright, let's take care of this first, then I'm going to drive across.
[88:35.05]Car alright?
[88:35.43]What's the damage?
[88:38.53]I think I'm okay.
[88:45.45]182.
[88:45.49]That's alright.
[88:45.93]I'll be fine.
[88:48.48]Yeah, I'm good.
[88:49.74]I'll be good.
[88:53.31]Now I'm gonna refill this one.
[88:54.47]Should I just- I'm stro- whatever.
[88:55.87]I don't care.
[88:56.67]And I- I wanna sleep too.
[89:02.28]I don't like the darkness.
[89:03.38]I don't like it.
[89:03.72]I can just press two buttons and it's bright out.
[89:10.99]Ram gas pump.
[89:12.11]No, I did that already.
[89:12.93]It doesn't do anything.
[89:13.55]I'm not doing it again.
[89:30.06]Let's go faster.
[89:31.32]This car's going like 25 miles per hour.
[89:33.88]Go!
[89:38.24]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[89:44.93]Alright, we're good.
[89:46.75]Let's get it on the road here so I don't have to worry about it.
[89:52.61]Handbrake, park it, and he's drunk.
[90:05.01]Remember, some guy's sister hates you.
[90:10.28]Okay.
[90:14.86]Camera in the top left.
[90:16.48]Actually, you're right.
[90:19.26]Put it up here, actually.
[90:19.94]I'll flip it.
[90:28.47]That feels so weird, doesn't it?
[90:36.66]I'm not going to put the camera in the middle of this.
[90:40.73]Um... Can I get... Am I able to get out of this?
[90:43.71]Okay.
[90:46.79]Pull me out of the mud.
[90:52.01]I'm going to drive around this.
[90:52.89]This is stupid.
[90:56.68]I'm going to drive around this.
[90:57.66]Because why would I do this?
[90:58.68]This is the dumbest thing ever.
[91:03.55]I just broke the fucking tree.
[91:04.87]Alright.
[91:05.29]How do I get out of here without causing a problem?
[91:17.84]Okay.
[91:20.38]No, no, no.
[91:20.74]Up here.
[91:25.45]Oh!
[91:27.97]Alright.
[91:28.25]Thank god.
[91:29.09]Now how do I get up?
[91:29.93]Watch out for the...
[91:33.17]I'm gonna abandon the truck.
[91:36.25]I'm gonna abandon the truck I think.
[91:39.93]I'm abandoning the fucking truck.
[91:40.81]I don't care.
[91:41.63]I don't want it.
[91:43.03]I don't want this truck anymore.
[91:44.06]I don't like it.
[91:47.12]Wait.
[92:04.41]Go.
[92:06.66]Go.
[92:08.04]Go.
[92:08.74]No.
[92:09.48]It's going to get trapped in the fucking lawnmower blades.
[92:12.66]And I'm going to get stuck here.
[92:13.78]Oh, thank God.
[92:31.13]We're good.
[92:34.28]Finally.
[92:34.70]Okay.
[92:36.48]Fuel up and then I'm going to drive around the creek.
[92:39.06]I'm not doing that again.
[92:39.96]Let's go.
[92:52.97]What's a better route to get over here?
[92:54.44]I want to look at the map.
[92:59.94]Okay, we've got the creek here.
[93:01.40]I could go down.
[93:03.08]No, there's another creek.
[93:04.57]Fuck it, I'm just going.
[93:05.99]I'm just going.
[93:06.47]Let's go.
[93:06.94]I'm going.
[93:07.52]Fuck it.
[93:28.28]I'm so impatient, I can't!
[93:30.22]I'm gonna- As-
[93:59.30]Get over here.
[94:00.98]Handbrake!
[94:01.80]Handbrake, please.
[94:02.62]Okay, attach.
[94:11.73]Let's go!
[94:14.35]Come on!
[94:17.15]This is the mouse taking the splinter out of the lion's paw.
[94:20.36]Yes!
[94:22.08]Alright, we're good.
[94:27.97]This is going... Alright, I don't know if I should do this.
[94:30.05]It's like getting too close.
[94:31.51]It's too heavy.
[94:33.79]It's too heavy.
[94:34.49]Okay, stop, stop, stop.
[94:35.75]Slowly stop the cars.
[94:37.19]Slowly stop the cars.
[94:38.27]Slowly stop the cars.
[94:40.25]Okay, stop.
[94:41.16]Handbrake.
[94:42.86]Okay, switch cars.
[94:44.28]Immediately.
[94:48.92]Alright.
[94:49.20]We're good.
[94:54.90]This is Karazhan level?
[94:59.19]What do you mean, Karazhan?
[95:00.21]Alright, we're good.
[95:08.28]Alright, I'm fine.
[95:10.04]Don't say those words.
[95:12.52]Am I ever gonna wear a wig?
[95:13.36]Probably not, I don't know.
[95:17.20]It means comfy.
[95:18.80]Oh, they're comparing it to the worst stream I've ever done.
[95:21.71]I disagree, I'm having a good time.
[95:24.69]During the Karazhan stream, I was just like...
[95:28.20]I fucking hate streaming.
[95:29.26]I hate broadcasting.
[95:30.42]Like that was honestly like I just want to turn off my stream and never come back.
[95:33.40]I was like I'm actually having a good time.
[95:40.07]Sunflowers?
[95:40.67]Yeah, I'll show you the sunflowers.
[95:47.82]Next stream.
[95:48.14]We're gonna start No More Heroes 3 this coming weekend.
[95:53.35]This is far from the worst.
[95:54.43]Yeah, they're just trying to push buttons.
[95:56.66]They're just trying to like push your buttons.
[95:58.26]I get it.
[95:58.76]Okay, I gotta be careful because I'm not going right.
[96:08.34]We need to go... Where's the garage?
[96:10.41]Alright.
[96:14.57]I'm gonna go down this road here.
[96:16.67]And there's an intersection here.
[96:17.79]Let's figure it out.
[96:18.97]I'm just gonna go this way.
[96:21.35]We hate you for real.
[96:23.55]No?
[96:26.17]Whatever.
[96:26.49]And there's gas over here.
[96:29.13]That's fine.
[96:29.47]Good.
[96:29.79]Alright.
[96:30.73]Take the regular road.
[96:31.77]Don't be an idiot.
[96:32.49]Don't go that way.
[96:34.45]What does that sign say?
[96:35.49]That sign... Um... I don't even know what that is.
[96:44.29]That's like a truck?
[96:46.91]Okay.
[96:47.03]Alright.
[96:49.05]I thought it was a mountain.
[96:50.52]Okay.
[96:50.84]Watch out.
[96:51.14]It's bumpy.
[96:51.74]I get it.
[96:53.37]bumpy road it's a beached whale okay this is not that bad it's pretty good okay well that's a problem that's an issue
[97:23.26]Can I go around it?
[97:30.65]Floor it?
[97:31.29]I'm... I just did, like, a... Do a raw?
[97:39.59]Why did that all get knocked down?
[97:42.32]Wait, can I honk on... Will it break this?
[97:50.41]No.
[97:52.05]I'm getting in the other truck.
[97:55.39]I'm not going to screw around here.
[97:58.29]In the other car.
[98:01.15]First of all, turn the engine off of this.
[98:02.49]How do I do that?
[98:02.93]Put the handbrake on.
[98:05.79]Turn the engine off.
[98:09.67]Let's go.
[98:15.01]I'm not going to mess around here.
[98:16.05]I have to get around this.
[98:16.83]Can I go through it?
[98:18.25]I can just go through here.
[98:23.75]Excuse me.
[98:27.87]Excuse me.
[98:35.84]I can't go through it.
[98:36.92]It's there's a wall there.
[98:45.99]I'm going to keep all wheel drive on.
[98:55.67]Should I be doing this?
[98:56.51]Is this the correct thing to do?
[98:57.49]I can't even see in front of me.
[99:05.67]There's no way I'm going to be able to get the Mack truck over here.
[99:08.09]Alright, back on the road.
[99:17.66]Garage.
[99:18.04]I'm going to the garage right now.
[99:19.02]That's the plan.
[99:21.64]Well, that's what that truck is.
[99:22.50]I can come back later, maybe.
[99:23.42]I don't know.
[99:23.72]Alright.
[99:25.18]Where do I go from here?
[99:26.60]Straight down here.
[99:27.10]Let's go.
[99:31.56]That's enough of the face cam.
[99:32.68]Face cam has been allotted.
[99:40.77]Stop.
[99:51.55]I'm not just going to drive that way.
[99:52.75]It's a very bad idea.
[99:54.03]This is the first area.
[99:55.09]I want to get, I at least want to see like one or two more areas.
[99:58.52]I want to see the snow level.
[99:59.68]I want to see the, I don't know.
[100:02.76]I want to see like the other zones.
[100:04.50]I don't want to just see the mud area.
[100:06.26]This is cool, but I want to see snow and ice.
[100:21.87]Stop driving in the middle of the road.
[100:26.18]Wait, why?
[100:29.02]The drunker I get, the more that I enjoy this.
[100:31.20]Oh, you drinking and just hanging out?
[100:33.47]Alright.
[100:40.95]Alright, there's a watchtower over here.
[100:42.90]Alright, um...
[100:45.66]So we need to go right to the farm.
[100:47.00]We need to go down here.
[100:48.39]That's probably... That's like a... That's gonna be like the Lord of the Rings part where they're on the side of the mountain.
[100:56.19]Where the rocks are fighting each other or whatever.
[101:08.16]Don't even tell me.
[101:09.00]Don't get stuck here.
[101:09.64]Are you kidding me?
[101:13.11]How?
[101:18.26]Oh, how did that even happen?
[101:19.20]Alright, let's go.
[101:27.25]Keep it on low gear.
[101:32.57]Am I going to get stuck here?
[101:33.59]Is there another car?
[101:37.47]You have all-wheel drive off.
[101:39.67]Oh shit, that's right.
[101:41.27]Thanks.
[101:50.66]New area, farm.
[101:51.96]I wonder if there's a new car.
[101:58.17]Is low gear better?
[101:59.11]I think it is because it doesn't move the tires.
[102:02.01]Look, I'm going to say something really stupid probably in those of you that know anything about cars and off-roading.
[102:06.43]Is low gear better because the tires grip the ground and the tires spin slower?
[102:14.45]Is it like, oh, the tires spin slower and it grips the ground harder.
[102:19.51]That's correct, right?
[102:24.32]There's more torque, right?
[102:32.04]It spins slower, yeah.
[102:34.38]Okay, so I had it right.
[102:37.24]There's less displacement to the ground.
[102:38.92]Yeah, yeah.
[102:40.84]Nice.
[102:42.90]Um, what's even over here?
[102:45.90]Not really anything.
[102:46.52]Alright, this is where it gets dangerous.
[102:48.46]I'm kind of afraid of this part, but let's just go.
[102:50.57]Whatever.
[102:51.07]Screw it.
[102:56.51]I got plenty of gas.
[102:57.33]I'm gonna make it.
[102:58.53]I hope.
[103:06.50]It's very rocky over here.
[103:07.54]This is bumpy.
[103:08.90]This is getting bumpy.
[103:16.91]Do this in real life.
[103:18.63]I would have died an hour ago.
[103:23.17]The stream would just be live of wherever I ended up.
[103:25.95]So, no.
[103:34.13]The camera would just be pointing to the sky.
[103:36.11]To whatever, like, ravine I fell in.
[103:40.33]Um, nope.
[103:41.21]No, thank you.
[103:42.68]Leave it to the professionals.
[103:55.57]Alright, we're almost there.
[104:00.57]This is... I don't... I gotta be careful here because this is really, really muddy.
[104:05.13]I'm gonna try to drive away from that because I don't want to get stuck in that.
[104:08.57]Can we avoid it?
[104:12.17]Don't tip.
[104:13.25]Don't tip.
[104:13.71]You're good.
[104:15.61]Alright, I gotta assess the situation here.
[104:19.81]I kind of need to go around the left side.
[104:33.31]Okay.
[104:40.87]How are you supposed to do this?
[104:48.52]Don't fall in the water.
[104:49.58]Oh my goodness.
[104:50.72]Don't fall in the water.
[104:54.21]I can't move the car.
[105:02.85]Alright, just all-wheel drive, floor it, pull.
[105:04.93]We're good.
[105:15.81]When does the stream start?
[105:17.65]Uh, starting soon.
[105:32.74]No, no, no.
[105:33.20]Attach here.
[105:35.72]Right here.
[105:37.10]And then we're going to go all-wheel drive.
[105:40.22]Pole floor.
[105:47.06]Nice.
[105:47.40]I made it out.
[105:48.48]I did it.
[105:53.24]We're almost there.
[105:54.06]I'm almost at the garage.
[105:54.94]I've almost completed chapter one.
[105:56.86]I've almost done it.
[106:04.67]I don't think I have to be in low gear right now.
[106:06.31]Yeah, this is fine.
[106:09.39]Whoops.
[106:10.03]Hold on.
[106:12.67]In the grass.
[106:13.13]Remember the road you avoided in the beginning led to the garage.
[106:22.30]Yeah, we got to do it the hard way.
[106:23.50]There it is.
[106:26.62]Nice.
[106:27.30]Finally.
[106:27.68]I made it.
[106:33.36]You've discovered your first garage.
[106:34.66]What you have done so far is the meat of the game.
[106:37.68]Explore and discover watchtowers, complete contracts, earn rewards, and find garages to improve or buy new vehicles.
[106:44.10]Alright, so what do I do?
[106:49.49]Upgrade location discovered.
[106:51.05]Get upgrade.
[106:53.75]You can find upgrades in the world.
[106:55.09]They may not apply to your current vehicle, but will be useful for others.
[107:00.10]An all-wheel drive powertrain that can provide torque to all connected.
[107:03.48]Not available for the current truck.
[107:04.64]Okay.
[107:10.30]Whoa, what happened with that?
[107:12.33]Garage discovered.
[107:17.45]You can use the garage to turn your truck into a real monster.
[107:21.95]Alright.
[107:22.33]850 bucks?
[107:29.46]What do I do?
[107:30.82]Customize.
[107:32.06]The garage is used to store, upgrade, customize, buy, and sell vehicles, but also for traveling to other regions.
[107:37.69]Okay.
[107:40.55]Holy shit.
[107:41.19]Alright.
[107:42.39]The engine.
[107:42.95]You can upgrade the engine.
[107:46.75]So it means more power.
[107:50.28]That's what I currently have.
[107:51.10]Explore Michigan to find this.
[107:53.32]I don't have any of these things.
[107:55.85]Stock gearbox.
[107:58.33]More control.
[108:00.07]Dispension.
[108:03.37]What the hell?
[108:05.39]I want that.
[108:06.03]And I want huge tires.
[108:08.91]Ooh, wait a minute.
[108:11.29]Highway, all-terrain, or... All-terrain?
[108:21.33]What do I have?
[108:21.63]I have 8,800 bucks.
[108:25.26]On road, good.
[108:25.98]Off road, average.
[108:27.88]Okay, on road, average.
[108:29.31]Off road, good.
[108:30.37]Mud, average.
[108:31.35]Mud, good.
[108:32.25]Right?
[108:37.21]I think I want mud.
[108:38.99]Mud, good.
[108:41.24]Put on truck nuts.
[108:44.86]Oh, excellent on road.
[108:47.18]Okay, I have terrible in mud right now.
[108:49.54]I definitely want to get... Who cares about on road?
[108:52.12]It's a regular road.
[108:52.79]You're going to be fine.
[108:55.70]Let's go with the 31-inch AS2s.
[108:58.02]I think so.
[109:04.34]Okay, winch.
[109:09.44]Whoa.
[109:11.08]A low-strength winch set up with a dedicated battery unit.
[109:13.56]Not as powerful as more common variants, but can operate even when the vehicle's engine is turned off.
[109:18.42]That's a lot of money.
[109:18.98]Okay, keep the stock one.
[109:24.02]Engageable lock?
[109:29.11]Snorkel?
[109:29.87]What do you mean a snorkel?
[109:32.31]Oh, mushroom-shaped snorkel that protects your engine from taking in water.
[109:35.59]Wait, wait.
[109:36.17]Actually, I put my mouth on that and breathe?
[109:37.85]What does that... What do you mean?
[109:40.16]A snorkel?
[109:45.08]I gotta get that, right?
[109:46.04]Yeah, I want the snorkel.
[109:48.60]Because then I can go into water.
[109:49.62]Alright, frame add-ons.
[109:52.40]Can't do any of these.
[109:53.70]Can I do any... Ooh, rear bumper.
[109:55.93]Don't.
[109:59.25]Rank 10.
[110:02.04]Oh, I definitely have to get the park ranger beacon, right?
[110:08.18]Yeah, I want the Jurassic Park vehicle.
[110:10.62]Alright, front bumper.
[110:14.39]I like that.
[110:23.13]Miscellaneous.
[110:25.19]Side pipe thresholds?
[110:27.64]Sure.
[110:27.80]What about rims?
[110:33.22]Why would I want rims?
[110:34.22]Don't they just get really dirty?
[110:39.54]I can change the color.
[110:40.44]Should I make it the Jerma985 mobile?
[110:44.32]Okay.
[110:52.94]Can I do any other colors?
[110:57.01]Well, I can do that one at least.
[110:57.95]That's fine.
[110:59.15]The Jurassic Park vehicle is that color, isn't it?
[111:01.05]Bobbleheads?
[111:08.26]Oh!
[111:09.52]Auto!
[111:11.62]I can't believe there's an auto!
[111:16.18]Accessories.
[111:19.82]Hearts, ace of spades, autumn leaf, golden leaf, pine tree.
[111:26.09]How about ream catcher, pipe monster, ranch.
[111:39.79]How about let's go with rental car.
[111:44.23]There.
[111:50.94]Stickers.
[111:53.06]Shut up and take my winch.
[111:55.18]Light my fire.
[111:58.46]Your adventure.
[112:03.07]Should I do what, like, those people do when they have, like, fucking Clinton Gore?
[112:07.47]Like, 1998?
[112:08.09]Like, still on their car?
[112:12.80]Bush Cheney!
[112:18.22]I'm in charge.
[112:19.42]Wild.
[112:24.19]Off-road.
[112:24.97]How about his mud?
[112:25.79]I like that one.

[113:08.19]It's crazy that like all these could be the label of every craft beer I've ever had.
[113:13.42]Oh, the Crazy Elephant!
[113:25.68]Ooh, I like the tiger.
[113:31.67]Hide.
[113:32.55]Pedal to the metal.

[113:36.63]Top gear.
[113:39.56]Truck.
[113:41.42]Truck.
[113:42.64]For Mother Russia.
[113:50.24]I like this one.
[113:53.08]This reminds me of every 90s fucking beverage that was available.
[113:56.91]That was off-brand.
[113:57.75]That wasn't like Pepsi or Coke brand.
[113:59.21]I like it.
[114:06.43]Windshield stickers.
[114:07.35]Don't these get in the way?
[114:08.07]Where's, um, live, laugh, love.
[114:12.59]Where is it?
[114:13.47]I hope it's here.
[114:16.84]Must eat mud.
[114:24.12]road car.

[114:40.63]Staver tooth.
[114:42.27]How about the cobra?
[114:43.09]Alright, cool.
[114:51.80]I wish I had more to do.
[114:53.14]Well, at least I got better tires.
[114:55.09]Can I clean it?
[115:05.53]Truck store.
[115:07.65]Oh, man.
[115:08.13]Are you serious?
[115:14.88]Alright, truck store.
[115:15.68]This is your truck store.
[115:16.28]You have to be a certain rank.
[115:18.68]Oh, Chevy CK1500.
[115:22.45]What else is there?
[115:26.39]126,000.
[115:27.62]What is that?
[115:29.40]Wait.
[115:30.64]Wait.
[115:31.32]I can actually buy these?
[115:34.82]You can drive around in a crane?
[115:36.96]Why?
[115:37.26]That's a lot of cars.
[115:40.90]Is that a fire truck?
[115:49.59]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[115:53.48]Highway, heavy duty, heavy, off-road, scout.
[116:00.28]Damn it, I want this so bad.
[116:02.10]That sucks that I can't have it.
[116:03.24]This truck is not available in North America.
[116:12.38]What?
[116:13.00]I can't buy this because I live in America?
[116:17.98]Not available in North America?
[116:19.42]Am I getting, like, country-gated?
[116:26.86]Why?
[116:27.16]Oh, in-game.
[116:32.54]Oh, I was going to say, that's insane.
[116:35.28]Sorry, sorry.
[116:36.02]These are only available in, like, Russia.
[116:39.01]These are only available in, like, EU.
[116:41.67]Only available in Europe.
[116:47.23]I was desperately trying to figure out what that actually meant.
[116:49.37]Alright, well, I got my cool car now.
[116:57.05]Some interesting trucks or resources can only be found in other locations.
[116:59.69]Let's do some traveling.
[117:01.39]Prepare your truck for transportation by using the retain function with X. Retain.
[117:07.69]Vehicle is now placed in the truck storage.
[117:09.05]You're ready to travel.
[117:09.95]Go to the global map with Y. Oh, shit.
[117:15.07]Okay.
[117:16.45]You're currently in Michigan.
[117:17.39]Let's go to... Alaska.
[117:22.02]Let's go to Alaska.
[117:24.54]Yes.
[117:30.07]Awesome.
[117:31.16]Snow time.
[117:31.72]Let's go.
[117:32.02]You have a garage waiting for you here.
[117:34.80]This is your primary base of operations.
[117:36.24]For the time being, let's get inside.
[117:37.94]Select the garage and the objects tab and enter it.
[117:40.54]Sounds good.
[117:44.14]Garage.
[117:47.90]This is what I was looking forward to.
[117:49.42]We finally get to play the title.
[117:54.05]Alright, truck storage.
[117:59.15]Where's my truck?
[118:03.97]Oh.
[118:04.43]DLC?
[118:09.08]Look at these!
[118:09.70]They're so much cooler!
[118:10.70]That's... I want this, but I don't have enough money.
[118:16.42]Why is it $20,000 to buy this?
[118:22.33]Oh, I can sell it!
[118:25.45]I can sell this and buy this.
[118:26.69]What's the DLC?
[118:27.47]How much does it cost?
[118:31.04]Can I deploy it?
[118:31.50]Holy shit.
[118:34.18]I actually do own it.
[118:34.96]Why do I own- I own the DLC.
[118:36.54]Did I buy the like exclusive edition?
[118:38.50]How do I own this?
[118:42.39]Are you kidding me?
[118:43.01]That's awesome.
[118:43.79]I'm so happy.
[118:44.73]Just sell it all and just put like a bunch of truck nuts on the car.
[118:51.11]I think I bought- I must have bought the digital deluxe version of the game.
[118:55.56]Oh, hell yeah.
[118:56.02]I want to see how this works.
[118:59.26]Alright, I'm going to sell one so I can upgrade.
[119:02.15]I think.
[119:02.37]No, I just want to see what it looks like.
[119:04.91]Okay, let's...
[119:30.01]Hell yeah.
[119:32.59]Alright.
[119:33.53]I'm gonna go.
[119:34.09]I want to just take a look for a minute.
[119:37.44]I'm just gonna go up down.
[119:38.42]I want to do the watchtower.
[119:39.56]I'm gonna go down the road.
[119:41.06]Alright, we have Enterprise.
[119:43.52]Let's look at how much shit there is here.
[119:45.42]Pipeline construction oil delivery.
[119:48.77]This is very overwhelming.
[119:52.79]Um...
[119:55.10]Drilling equipment.
[119:56.30]Drill rig.
[119:57.68]From water to land.
[119:59.88]Oil delivery.
[120:01.90]Okay.
[120:03.76]Deliver to the service site.
[120:05.49]I need oil barrels.
[120:07.87]I need to deliver oil barrels to a bunch of places.
[120:13.39]Where do I get the oil barrels?
[120:18.11]Okay, I'm invested.
[120:18.81]Let's go.
[120:21.67]Wait, it's locked.
[120:22.29]Why?
[120:23.88]Oh shit, I have to go in the straight line here.
[120:26.08]We've got an urgent contract for you.
[120:27.60]Local fuel company is building a pipeline and just hired us as a subcontractor.
[120:31.31]Deliver everything they need fast.
[120:33.81]I need service spare parts times two.
[120:38.15]Okay, service spare parts times two.
[120:40.09]You have to go through the tunnel that connects locations to reach your target destination.
[120:49.24]So service spare parts are here at the service hub and then we have to go to the pipeline thing.
[120:55.05]Alright, let's go.
[120:55.86]I'm ready.
[121:03.46]Buy and sell trailers?
[121:05.01]Alright.
[121:05.83]Wait, I needed something.
[121:07.03]How am I going to put oil barrels on here?
[121:08.95]Can I?
[121:14.32]Oh, all-wheel drive is always on on this thing.
[121:24.10]I need a trailer.
[121:24.92]Put him on the seats.
[121:27.51]Just put him in the back seat.
[121:31.01]That's very slippery.
[121:32.19]This is very slippery.
[121:42.16]Maybe I should get the big thing.
[121:49.58]I wonder if I can pull them with the winch.
[121:50.85]Does this thing have a winch?
[121:58.85]Yeah, I gotta put snow tires on here.
[122:00.25]I have no idea what's on here right now.
[122:07.85]Uh, this seems to do OK in the snow.
[122:16.36]This is important.
[122:16.92]Press 1 for auto.
[122:20.80]Oh, he's not even in here.
[122:21.56]Oh, this is first person.
[122:22.22]Cool.
[122:29.67]Alright.
[122:30.43]Service spare parts.
[122:31.85]I can load it.
[122:32.35]How do I get out of this view?
[122:43.62]Two.
[122:44.10]One.
[122:44.50]Oh.
[122:46.90]Load.
[122:47.16]I can't load it?
[122:50.94]Shit.
[122:51.60]Well, hold on.
[122:56.42]Yeah, I can't put it on here.
[123:01.28]What is this?
[123:06.54]You reject tasks or small additional objectives that will often make your life easier.
[123:10.12]Good opportunity to earn money to discover when exploring the world.
[123:14.16]Alright, what is this task?
[123:16.78]Name's Pete.
[123:17.30]I work for a transport company called Alaskan Transit.
[123:20.29]We've had an unfortunate accident that's resulted in containers of tools stuck in the river.
[123:23.99]Can you locate them and get them to the base?
[123:26.71]Yeah, sure.
[123:32.85]Yeah, I need a bigger car.
[123:34.04]I'm going to take the big thing.
[123:37.76]I have an important question.
[123:38.54]Do you freeze your bread?
[123:41.50]No.
[123:42.92]I don't.
[123:44.56]I mean, if you buy more than one loaf at a time, I guess maybe you could do that, right?
[123:48.12]I don't freeze my bread.
[123:49.02]Alright, let's go to the garage.
[123:55.29]There's a trailer here.
[123:56.15]Alright, I'm ready.
[124:06.93]I freeze my bread.
[124:07.63]Yeah, it lasts longer, but if you're gonna eat it... If you know you're gonna eat a loaf of bread in a week or two, why would you freeze it?
[124:12.44]It's for the crunch.
[124:27.61]So it's crisp.
[124:31.23]Why are you eating crispy bread?
[124:34.19]Are you talking about like toasting it?
[124:35.51]Why does it need to be crunchy?
[124:40.63]When you toast it, wouldn't the moisture kind of be weird?
[124:43.49]I don't know.
[124:44.44]I feel like it would start dripping water.
[124:45.68]Alright, where's the garage?
[125:01.09]It evaporates.
[125:05.44]It doesn't, I just did it.
[125:08.86]It's a little dry though.
[125:11.50]Yeah, no, I'm not freezing my bread.
[125:13.34]No, thanks.
[125:23.37]I'm taking the big thing.
[125:24.51]I'm going to put some new tires on it.
[125:27.71]I'm going to sell some shit too.
[125:28.73]Why not?
[125:29.40]Alright.
[125:30.06]Truck storage.
[125:32.32]Which one of these do I not give a shit about?
[125:34.02]This one's awesome.
[125:38.62]This one's really cool.
[125:40.28]This one's ugly.
[125:43.06]Yeah.
[125:47.12]Oh, wait.
[125:47.50]Hold on.
[125:49.36]Highway, mud tires, all terrain.
[125:51.72]Alright, this is the one that is going to be good for the snow.
[125:56.68]This one... Is a highway car...
[126:02.57]It says all-wheel drive, switchable.
[126:06.34]This is worth $40,000.
[126:06.82]I'm selling it.
[126:14.86]Now I've got $40,000.
[126:15.28]Alright, let's go.
[126:17.74]Deploy this.
[126:20.45]Customize it.
[126:26.03]I have to go too crazy here.
[126:27.53]Tires, here we go.
[126:31.96]What does it have right now?
[126:32.60]This is on-road, off-road.
[126:33.98]Mud is average, which would be snow too, wouldn't it?
[126:39.85]On-road, poor.
[126:40.95]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[126:41.75]Keep this.
[126:43.21]Who cares about on-road?
[126:47.07]Yeah, definitely keep these on.
[126:47.97]Okay, get a snorkel on here.
[126:56.84]Saddle high.
[126:58.42]Roof rack.
[126:58.76]Roof rack.
[126:59.92]A roof-mounted trunk carrying supplies, fuel, and some basic repair tools.
[127:03.04]Oh, yeah.
[127:03.48]Let's go.
[127:06.92]Sideboard bed.
[127:07.74]High saddle.
[127:12.96]Yeah.
[127:14.44]And give me the bed.
[127:15.06]This looks pretty good.
[127:20.03]Alright.
[127:20.37]Rooftop.
[127:23.99]What do you mean 1X?
[127:24.65]Alright.
[127:25.21]That's good.
[127:27.51]Front bumper.
[127:27.89]Front bumper.
[127:32.43]Selenius.
[127:32.91]I like the orange.
[127:35.33]No, I don't.
[127:36.17]Big horns.
[127:36.63]Good.
[127:49.13]What is this DLC?
[127:53.78]It's a bowl.
[127:54.40]No, I like this one.
[127:57.88]You change tires?
[128:00.08]I could.
[128:05.15]Make it auto in there.
[128:06.01]And then... Where is it?
[128:12.53]Mud.
[128:12.77]And then we put the mud monster here.
[128:17.69]And then mud up.
[128:22.38]Mud up or shut up.
[128:25.74]I'd fire.
[128:28.98]Looks good to me.
[128:35.14]I don't think I can do chain tires.
[128:38.94]Yeah, they're not unlocked.
[128:40.10]These will be good for now.
[128:45.66]Alright, let's try it.
[128:54.86]Uh, what the hell?
[128:56.28]That was weird.
[128:59.87]Now, should I get...
[129:03.44]I have a couple things going on here.
[129:04.54]Let's do the, uh... Okay, I want to do the pipe thing.
[129:07.91]Let's go to the service hub.
[129:08.75]Let's just do... Let's get this out of the way.
[129:11.03]And then where's this other thing that has the parts in the river or something?
[129:15.85]Containers in the river.
[129:16.97]Yeah, this one.
[129:19.95]Oh, shit.
[129:20.25]It's right here.
[129:21.07]Perfect.
[129:21.37]Alright.
[129:23.49]Alright, now let's really actually move.
[129:25.08]Let's go.
[129:37.31]Where are those markers I just put?
[129:45.88]Alright, this has got all-wheel drive too, doesn't it?
[129:48.46]Oh yeah, it does.
[129:50.52]This thing is a monster.
[129:58.85]There's an Easter egg if you hit 80 miles per hour with this truck.
[130:02.89]Which way should I go?
[130:05.91]Stanley Road.
[130:16.85]It's so distracting.
[130:23.08]It's too dark.
[130:27.62]You're being unsafe.
[130:29.68]Well, I'm just trying to... Why do I have headlights?
[130:36.61]How do I turn the headlights on?
[130:37.93]I don't know how to turn the headlights on.
[130:48.77]H?
[130:49.82]LB plus B?
[130:52.30]Oh God!
[130:53.14]I can see!
[130:54.40]I haven't been able to see this whole time in the dark.
[130:59.15]I was like, it sucks being out at night.
[131:01.29]You can't do anything.
[131:10.29]Alright.
[131:11.95]Here's the parts.
[131:13.95]We have spare parts loaded up.
[131:16.49]Looks good.
[131:18.14]Deliver those parts.
[131:34.76]You're playing with a controller, Omegalull?
[131:36.82]Yeah, why, wait, you... Why would you want to play this game without a controller?
[131:42.58]W, A, S, D in the mouse does not translate well to car movement.
[131:46.87]It just doesn't.
[131:47.83]It's not a natural turning of the wheel motion.
[131:56.31]Like, being able to actually have a stick move left, right, up?
[132:01.00]A, D, no.
[132:02.46]No.
[132:04.55]And the trigger is almost like a gas pedal.
[132:06.44]It's like, step on the gas.
[132:08.64]Not pressing W with, like, your index finger.
[132:11.14]It has, like, a little bit of resistance.
[132:12.34]It's like pulling, stepping on the gas.
[132:13.90]Alright, what do I need to do first?
[132:16.74]Alright, I need to deliver these to the pipeline, but wait.
[132:21.23]Uh, I gotta go here first.
[132:27.33]Clear everything.
[132:27.91]We're going this way.
[132:34.33]Let's go.
[132:34.71]Oh, there's a watchtower right here.
[132:36.55]Get the watchtower first.
[132:53.28]Are you gonna get the Steam upper decker?
[132:58.87]I don't, I, are you talking about the Steam, uh, game pad, like, switch thing?
[133:04.36]I don't know why you're calling it an upper decker, like, are you taking a shit in somebody's tank in their bathroom?
[133:10.04]What, why, up, why are you calling it an upper decker?
[133:12.80]That's freaking me out.
[133:15.58]Why are you calling it that?
[133:21.70]Hey, dude, you're gonna take an upper decker in the Steam box?
[133:24.80]Um, I, no?
[133:29.04]Why did you say upper decker?
[133:37.45]I need to know what you mean.
[133:40.95]It's called the Steam Deck.
[133:46.88]Yeah, but a Steam upper decker.
[133:51.08]I just imagine a guy playing that thing on the toilet.
[133:57.09]Like, that's why you called it that, because he's, like, taking a shit playing the Steam Deck.
[134:02.85]It's being correlated that way.
[134:06.28]Where am I?
[134:07.62]Yeah, no, no, it's not the wrong way.
[134:08.86]I was terrified to go this way, because it was weird.
[134:11.54]I'm gonna go this way.
[134:12.30]I'm gonna- I'm trying to go on the actual road.
[134:19.28]Up for Decker.
[134:32.81]Here we go.
[134:33.33]Alright.
[134:33.55]I just want to get the tower.
[134:42.52]Shit.
[134:42.62]This is supposed to be good in the off-road.
[134:44.78]I hope I don't get stuck.
[134:46.94]Does it have a winch?
[134:48.22]Thank God.
[134:53.16]Blow it down.
[134:53.64]I'm in deep, deep snow right now.
[134:59.12]But to answer the question, I don't know.
[135:01.36]I might get the Steam upper decker.
[135:03.91]No, I'm good.
[135:09.17]I can move.
[135:17.41]It depends.
[135:18.23]It really depends on that thing if it has a game gear battery or not.
[135:26.43]Like, if that thing doesn't last from a Vegas to LA plane ride, I don't want it.
[135:37.55]Diff lock?
[135:40.68]What's H?
[135:46.66]Diff lock.
[135:47.28]They didn't teach me that.
[135:47.96]What's diff lock?
[135:53.18]I heard it lasts about four to nine hours depending on load.
[135:59.67]LBY.
[136:00.23]Divlog is only available on low gear.
[136:05.72]Should I have these both on whenever I'm trying to go through rough terrain?
[136:11.60]So this turns this thing into like a tank, right?
[136:13.48]Like treads.
[136:13.96]I have no idea what this does.
[136:17.92]But holy shit, I'm about to go up a hill.
[136:19.46]This is not going to happen.
[136:20.06]I don't think this is going to happen.
[136:32.73]Very concerned about this.
[136:39.03]Okay.
[136:42.43]Alright.
[136:45.64]Didn't even give this truck a chance.
[136:46.84]Alright, left or right?
[136:58.26]Right, hopefully.
[136:59.46]Hope I don't get killed here.
[137:02.38]This is a comfy game.
[137:06.51]I did want my first stream back from the dollhouse to be like a comfy stream.
[137:10.03]You know what I mean?
[137:11.49]I just want to hang out, man.
[137:14.91]I got to turn off this lock because I can't move.
[137:20.86]Well, it looks like we're going this way because I can't turn the tires.
[137:33.51]This is stressing me out.
[137:34.55]I mean, it's kind of... It's not a high stress.
[137:45.39]I feel like we're going to get probably a high stress few streams this weekend.
[137:48.91]Because I'm starting No More Heroes 3.
[137:53.73]Probably do that on... I don't know, Saturday?
[137:57.61]Start it on Saturday?
[137:58.29]Because I really do want to go back to being on the weekends again.
[138:06.00]How am I going to get that?
[138:06.84]How am I going to activate this?
[138:11.56]Whatever I'm going for, I don't care.
[138:18.95]Just have to get close enough.
[138:30.58]Careful, I'm going to be careful.
[138:38.36]Is that a cliff?
[138:39.00]No.
[138:40.50]I hope I can get out of this.
[138:41.28]Alright, unlock it.
[138:48.72]Come on.
[138:51.50]Yeah, we'll be going back to Saturday, Sunday streams.
[138:55.59]Friday, Saturday.
[138:56.97]Saturday.
[138:58.35]One or two times a week, depending on what we're doing.
[139:00.67]We're going to have to do at least two streams in a row because of No More Heroes.
[139:06.38]Oh, God.
[139:08.02]What is all this?
[139:17.67]Where am I?
[139:20.81]Oh, what?
[139:21.47]Oh, I'm up here.
[139:23.03]Cargo container.
[139:27.69]I can't get this right now.
[139:28.81]Alright.
[139:31.70]Shit, I need to do this.
[139:33.04]This was worth a lot of money.
[139:34.98]Alright, I know what I'm doing.
[139:36.52]I'm dumping the cargo here and I'm going to pick this up.
[139:38.48]Because I need these two.
[139:42.37]Yep, okay.
[139:44.99]Good.
[139:48.31]I need to get these two things.
[139:49.17]Can this thing not back up?
[139:58.54]Just go to the pipeline?
[139:59.60]No, no, no, no.
[140:00.48]Wait a minute, why, why, why?
[140:01.48]I need a crane.
[140:02.24]Oh, shit, okay.
[140:03.00]Okay.
[140:04.13]Can I- is this gonna break if I drive across this thing?
[140:06.43]I feel like this is a rickety ass bridge.
[140:14.95]I am scared of going over this.
[140:18.67]How much do I weigh?
[140:19.27]Like 40,000 pounds?
[140:30.45]This doesn't look sturdy at all.
[140:31.81]I don't think this is a good idea.
[140:40.35]Easy.
[140:45.46]Okay, I'm on it.
[140:50.42]Alright, turns out it was safe.
[140:56.04]Now I gotta get out to the road here.
[140:57.96]Can I just drive straight?
[140:58.84]Alright, straight, and then we're gonna go up here.
[141:01.04]Where the pipe things are.
[141:02.20]Alright, let's go.
[141:07.48]Get out.
[141:18.43]It was a 27 point turn.
[141:21.79]Yeah, well, when you're in when you're in like an original Burger King chicken sandwich length car, you have to be fucking careful.
[141:39.07]Oh, I want one of those now so bad.
[141:41.07]Am I doing this right?
[142:02.27]Was there a tree?
[142:16.28]You can't just pull... Just pull me through the... Just go.
[142:27.02]What the hell?
[142:40.63]I can't see anything.
[142:41.97]Why did I go this way?
[142:47.72]What the fuck am I doing?
[142:53.10]Why would I drive through the woods?
[142:57.19]What the hell am I thinking?
[143:00.01]It's so du- Go to bed.
[143:01.21]Just wake up in like an hour.
[143:15.85]Come on, back up.
[143:17.39]Back up!
[143:19.93]Back up!
[143:22.24]Wow, what a comfy stream.
[143:24.02]I'm working on it.
[143:40.80]Pull!
[143:45.06]Come on!
[143:47.46]It's so close.
[143:55.77]Alright, pull me this way.
[143:58.49]There we go.
[143:59.11]Alright, stop.
[144:00.88]This is a great view, actually.
[144:01.94]Keep this view.
[144:17.59]Shit!
[144:18.95]No!
[144:19.53]I can't see!
[144:20.83]Is this a tree over here?
[144:26.87]No!
[144:27.57]It is a tree!
[144:28.65]It didn't even load in my game!
[144:30.47]Fuck!
[144:31.65]No!
[144:32.80]There's a tree on every side!
[144:34.82]This is the worst possible thing I could have done.
[144:37.42]This is the worst possible thing I could have done.
[144:43.94]Oh my god.
[144:44.90]I think I have to pull myself backwards.
[144:46.48]Fuck.
[144:49.39]Hold on.
[144:49.77]I think I'm okay.
[144:59.82]Wait.
[145:00.98]Hold on.
[145:04.70]There's a spot right here.
[145:38.46]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[145:40.38]Straighten it out.
[145:43.51]There's the opportunity right here.
[145:47.37]Make sure the tires are straight.
[145:48.27]Go!
[145:51.39]Yeah.
[145:52.71]Stop.
[145:58.46]I can't see anything.
[145:59.58]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[146:04.12]Where's the road?
[146:05.62]I'm not even halfway.
[146:07.00]I turned around.
[146:08.66]How did I turn around?
[146:11.48]I'm facing this way now?
[146:13.42]How?
[146:14.22]What?
[146:15.90]I don't understand.
[146:18.14]What are you talking about?
[146:19.24]I didn't turn around.
[146:22.06]I've been going the same direction the whole time.
[146:24.60]You gotta put these mirrors down.
[146:29.01]Hold on.
[146:29.81]Settle down.
[146:30.23]Relax.
[146:30.99]Not a big deal.
[146:35.07]No, I'm going the right way.
[146:36.19]Why is it looking like that?
[146:39.84]Um, alright.
[146:41.70]Attach.
[146:44.32]I have to pull myself this way.
[146:45.48]I just feel like I was playing Madden.
[146:54.07]I wanted to select the guy all the way to the right so I could run and try to fucking kill the quarterback.
[146:58.81]Like, that's what I did every time, every play.
[147:07.15]I gotta take a hard right.
[147:08.13]That's what I'm going for.
[147:08.97]There it is.
[147:13.97]Okay, there's an opening.
[147:17.99]Alright, I'm gonna get through here.
[147:19.09]There we go.
[147:22.07]Just go right through the needle, right here.
[147:25.53]Where's the next tree?
[147:27.29]It's right in front of that, isn't it?
[147:34.71]Which way are the tires turning?
[147:47.47]Looks like a pretty straight shot right here.
[148:00.84]No, there's a bump.
[148:02.42]There's a bump.
[148:03.68]But, give me the first person.
[148:06.00]Oh, shit.
[148:06.48]Okay, hold on.
[148:11.54]Alright.
[148:12.64]Okay.
[148:14.10]Straight ahead.
[148:16.66]Straight ahead.
[148:23.81]Fuck.
[148:24.36]Alright, now what?
[148:28.86]I think I can just go straight.
[148:29.82]I need- first person's probably better here.
[148:39.99]You see a road yet?
[148:43.85]Where's the road?
[148:52.53]Is that an opening?
[148:54.27]Alright, this is... I'm gonna... Okay, careful.
[149:09.10]This is the dumbest thing I've ever done.
[149:11.44]I don't know why I did this.
[149:13.62]I could have reset 20 minutes ago.
[149:16.04]Alright, we're gonna turn this way and pull it.
[149:20.50]No, wrong way.
[149:23.44]Good.
[149:24.56]Good.
[149:31.85]Okay, now I got a shot this way.
[149:36.23]Is this ever gonna end?
[149:39.61]No.
[149:39.95]I'm trying to go this way.
[149:44.46]Oh my fucking god.
[149:46.66]I give up, I think.
[149:47.90]It's time to give up.
[149:48.78]It's time to give up.
[149:49.32]I'm facing... I've given up.
[149:52.34]I don't think I can do this.
[149:53.46]I need to keep a marker here.
[149:56.96]Delete all markers.
[149:59.34]And put one right here.
[150:02.37]My god.
[150:06.90]I've made it harder.
[150:07.90]I was here.
[150:08.62]And I could've just gone this way.
[150:10.50]And now I have to go through this?
[150:12.64]What happened?
[150:14.92]I'm so confused how I did this.
[150:17.48]What did I think was gonna happen?
[150:18.97]I'm so distraught.
[150:20.73]I don't understand.
[150:22.89]Okay.
[150:23.91]Settle down.
[150:24.53]I'm gonna get through this shit.
[150:25.67]You and me.
[150:26.59]We're gonna get through this together.
[150:30.01]Oh, he doesn't even know, dude.
[150:34.67]Hold on.
[150:35.33]First and ten.
[150:36.93]Forty-yard line.
[150:37.52]Okay, got him.
[150:40.74]Ha!
[150:41.58]Sprint!
[150:42.20]Tackle!
[150:42.54]Tackle!
[150:42.80]I don't even care if I'm offsides.
[150:43.94]Hurt him.
[150:50.96]Did I break it?
[150:51.44]What happened to the winch?
[150:57.11]Winch is... Okay.
[151:00.55]I gotta... If I just go straight from here, don't be an idiot.
[151:03.57]Here we go.
[151:07.46]Oh, by the way, every time I played Madden, I just selected the safety every time and would just run around with them.
[151:14.92]By the way, I think some of you may have not been here when I talked about how my brother and I used to play and I would lose like 100 plus points to zero.
[151:23.23]I would just throw Hail Marys and miss every time.
[151:30.08]Okay.
[151:32.16]I think I can back up and recalibrate this and just go this way.
[151:38.95]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[151:42.03]Alright, I'm going to go to the right.
[151:44.07]It looks like an opportunity to go to the right side here.
[151:47.33]No, it doesn't.
[151:47.91]I'm fucked.
[151:48.95]I'm just restarting the game.
[151:57.37]I have to restart it.
[151:59.75]There's no coming away from this.
[152:00.99]I'm never going to get out of here.
[152:03.74]I have to go that way.
[152:07.14]Waiter?
[152:09.39]Alright, fine.
[152:10.59]I'll get, I'll do it.
[152:12.11]We're gonna, I'm gonna lose like two, three thousand viewers.
[152:14.33]I'm gonna lose like ten thousand of you, but I'm gonna go for it.
[152:19.99]As long as I can turn the wheel.
[152:22.12]There we go.
[152:22.98]Alright.
[152:26.64]Keep going.
[152:28.72]Now, if I go to the right.
[152:31.38]Yeah, okay.
[152:32.18]This'll be alright.
[152:35.16]I need to pull in a different direction though, because I don't want to get too close to this tree.
[152:37.57]Okay.
[152:40.90]We're going to pull this way.
[152:42.06]We're going to grab one of these trees over here on the right.
[152:43.74]This one here probably will do it.
[152:50.45]No, easy.
[152:51.11]Is it even attached?
[152:51.75]What is it doing?
[153:00.43]What is it even attached to?
[153:01.27]What the hell?
[153:11.51]Pull it.
[153:15.61]Oh my god, let it go.
[153:16.62]Come here.
[153:22.66]This one back here.
[153:23.92]Pull.
[153:25.69]Pull me.
[153:28.69]No, no, don't.
[153:29.75]Okay, I'm fine.
[153:32.23]Come back into that tree.
[153:33.03]Now we're going to pull it this way.
[153:33.95]Let it go.
[153:35.91]I'm gonna grab this side here that's closest.
[153:39.10]This one right here.
[153:39.88]I'm gonna grab this tree back here.
[153:41.46]Pull it.
[153:45.72]Where'd it go?
[153:48.72]Not in reverse?
[153:50.06]Oh.
[153:50.70]Hold on.
[153:55.57]I gotta grab the tree on the right.
[154:07.83]Come on, dude.
[154:10.15]Come on!
[154:18.16]Now we gotta back up.
[154:19.60]Back up!
[154:23.00]I am so screwed here.
[154:23.86]I don't think this is gonna happen.
[154:29.56]The Venga bus is coming?
[154:36.47]Somebody said the poor video game in-game character has not eaten.
[154:40.51]And you just have him stuck here.
[154:41.73]Okay, I obviously can't go that way.
[154:50.99]I'm going to try something different.
[154:51.93]Oh, that's the definition of insanity.
[154:54.14]It's trying the same thing with the same results happening.
[154:56.60]They keep going.
[154:57.46]You keep doing the same thing with the same results happening.
[155:02.34]Okay.
[155:13.66]Alright, I figured it out.
[155:14.26]I got it.
[155:19.30]I wasn't in reverse the whole time.
[155:21.62]Now this will make sense.
[155:22.43]Just wait.
[155:24.73]I'll get out of this.
[155:25.31]Don't worry.
[155:25.75]Everyone can relax.
[155:27.73]Look, I know I see you guys are making dinner or something anyways.
[155:30.83]Just hold your ResidentSleepers until I get out of this.
[155:32.81]Well, actually, no.
[155:33.45]Go ahead.
[155:33.91]Go to sleep.
[155:34.57]I'll wake you up.
[155:35.19]I promise.
[155:48.84]Stop hitting the horn dude.
[155:55.19]I don't know if I can get out of here.
[155:56.45]I don't think I can get out of here Fuck I'm sorry I'm sorry, you know, it's probably just gonna be easier if I just drive this way, you know, I mean like watch this I
[156:13.28]It's gonna be, I'm just gonna turn the whole fucking car around.
[156:16.34]I'm angry at this point.
[156:20.06]Watch this.
[156:33.96]Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[156:36.18]Got it.
[156:36.88]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[156:38.36]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[156:39.66]Don't do anything stupid.
[156:40.30]Here we go.
[156:52.65]Drive!
[156:54.08]Oh my god, drive the car.
[157:07.46]Boys and girls.
[157:09.46]We got it.
[157:10.76]I'm ready.
[157:11.96]Everything's good to go.
[157:16.87]There it is.
[157:17.45]There's our exit right there.
[157:22.42]Nice and easy.
[157:24.34]Back it up again.
[157:24.84]We're still fucked and no we're not.
[157:30.61]Look at that straight shot right there.
[157:31.83]You see it?
[157:32.17]Here we go.
[157:52.89]Come on.
[157:53.65]Nice and easy.
[157:54.17]Just thread, thread, thread, thread.
[157:56.75]Thread.
[157:57.35]Alright.
[157:58.00]Left or right?
[157:59.56]I'm gonna say stay right.
[158:00.60]Right here.
[158:20.31]Fuck, there's a tree right there.
[158:21.13]It's alright.
[158:33.66]It's so close.
[158:42.53]I did the same thing?
[158:44.39]Yeah, this time I'm getting out of it.
[158:45.93]Because, look.
[158:46.83]Wait, I did the same... No, I didn't.
[158:48.91]I did the same thing?
[158:49.61]I went to the same place?
[158:51.81]No, I didn't.
[158:53.37]I went to the same spot?
[158:54.80]I went to the same spot.
[158:56.68]I did go to the exact same spot.
[158:57.98]Oh, my God.
[158:58.46]What are you... You're right.
[159:00.06]You guys are right.
[159:00.58]Okay.
[159:00.88]Holy shit, you're right.
[159:03.24]Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.
[159:04.66]Okay, I'm done.
[159:06.26]Alright, I'm done.
[159:07.04]We're gonna go this way.
[159:09.30]I don't know how I did that.
[159:10.46]What an idiot.
[159:12.17]What a fucking total, just absolute moron.
[159:14.97]Okay, we're gonna try this again.
[159:16.21]Go this way.
[159:16.55]We're in the wheels, come on.
[159:38.79]Okay, this is a different path.
[159:41.51]There we go.
[159:42.15]I got it.
[159:44.29]Right?
[159:47.25]It's right there.
[159:47.75]I see the road.
[159:48.25]Alright, don't panic.
[159:49.38]Don't freak out.
[159:50.12]I think this way is the correct way.
[159:52.50]Can I fit through that?
[159:53.82]I think I can fit through this.
[159:54.64]Can I fit through here?
[160:03.76]I think I can fit right here.
[160:06.66]Like right here.
[160:13.29]Oh, fuck yeah.
[160:13.97]I'm almost there.
[160:15.25]Okay.
[160:15.79]Slow down.
[160:16.67]What's in front of me?
[160:18.63]Yeah!
[160:26.13]Let's go!
[160:26.67]I did it!
[160:31.85]Thank God!
[160:33.15]I can finally move on.
[160:38.67]Feels so good to get out of that.
[160:40.83]Alright.
[160:41.63]Let's deliver this.
[160:50.43]Hey, Larry, you were like an hour late with the deployment.
[160:53.77]What happened?
[160:55.27]I had traffic.
[160:57.19]Oh, yeah, traffic.
[160:58.97]I'm in Alaska.
[161:00.83]There's no cars.
[161:08.74]Alright, let's go tasks.
[161:12.44]This one here, I got the repair parts.
[161:14.20]Track it.
[161:14.60]Let's go.
[161:24.69]You wasted 40 gallons of fuel.
[161:38.28]Yeah, I want one of those long chickens from Burger King so bad right now.
[161:43.83]Stay in the road.
[161:53.67]How many viewers did we lose?
[161:56.21]be a thousand.
[161:58.29]They were the smart ones.
[161:59.05]Find all the tutorial hints.
[162:17.07]I know what I'm doing.
[162:30.77]Okay.
[162:33.73]Where do you buy the crane?
[162:34.99]Everyone keeps saying I need the crane for some of these other missions.
[162:53.35]I have a crane.
[162:54.13]I do?
[163:04.98]Why do you own a red sex t-shirt?
[163:09.04]Um, I guess somebody, people made, I, look, it was a Reddit thing.
[163:13.50]I don't know.
[163:14.92]I have no idea.
[163:15.30]Oh, just somebody linked me a thing where it's like, oh, look, you're like a serial killer.
[163:17.86]And I'm like, oh, okay.
[163:19.44]And I laughed for a second.
[163:20.26]I was like, oh, haha, a Jerm with a serial killer with the AI technology.
[163:24.35]I woke up the next day.
[163:25.15]It was on the front page of every Reddit.
[163:27.09]And people thought it was a real thing.
[163:28.11]And everyone just associates me with a fucking, like, a murderer.
[163:34.24]That's like 50,000 upvotes on the front page.
[163:36.81]I was like, alright, I just closed my phone.
[163:40.69]I was like, okay, well, I guess we're doing that now.
[163:47.59]Alright, $1,400.
[163:48.41]$180.
[163:49.17]This is now open.
[163:50.11]So this opens to another spot here.
[163:51.62]But I want to go... I kind of want to do that.
[163:57.60]Timber.
[163:59.76]Hi, the sawmill near the port is running out of wood, so we'll pay to have some delivered.
[164:05.60]Log loader crane is recommended.
[164:08.22]I don't have one of those, though.
[164:14.14]I guess that's on the way.
[164:18.40]So, again, explain to me how I get a crane, because I don't understand.
[164:21.10]Can I get it here?
[164:26.28]Trailer store or something?
[164:28.49]The other car has a crane.
[164:29.55]Oh, okay.
[164:36.50]You don't have a crane.
[164:48.67]I hope the murderer joke at least brought attention to the dollhouse stream.
[164:55.79]Oh, I don't care.
[164:56.51]It's funny.
[165:10.51]Logging missions are kind of hard, my king.
[165:13.27]We'll find out.
[165:28.49]Is this the sus guy?
[165:30.71]Join me on the next stream.
[165:32.81]The imposterous sus guy plays werewolf.
[165:38.14]The imposterous sus guy plays mafia!
[165:41.60]I don't even play Among Us.
[165:51.15]Okay.
[165:51.93]Let's see which one of these cars has a crane.
[165:57.07]Alright, so it would say it?
[165:57.99]Switchable.
[166:02.94]Compatibility.
[166:04.86]How can I tell if it has a crane?
[166:07.60]I mean, that looks like a crane on top of this.
[166:10.53]If I was a crane, I'd be that thing, the blue thing on top.
[166:18.73]But we have to mess with it.
[166:26.44]I could buy something now, can't I?
[166:27.82]I have 30,000.
[166:28.20]You know what?
[166:32.28]Let me take a look.
[166:33.16]Because if I sell a couple of these, I could get like $50,000. $50,000.
[166:38.19]What do I actually need?
[166:39.55]What should I actually buy?
[166:40.45]Oh, I know exactly what I want.
[166:44.29]How much is this?
[166:46.90]I don't have it unlocked.
[166:47.72]What the hell?
[166:48.28]That's annoying.
[166:48.72]Alright, let's customize it.
[166:57.59]Tires are fine.
[166:59.51]No, no, I want mud.
[167:06.65]I don't have anything unlocked for these.
[167:08.33]That's not good.
[167:10.99]What is it currently using?
[167:11.81]What's the difference?
[167:16.45]Get the freeze.
[167:17.59]Fine, I guess.
[167:18.91]Mud pour.
[167:19.55]That's not good.
[167:25.33]Okay.
[167:25.71]Well, whatever.
[167:30.50]Oh, jeez.
[167:32.38]Oh, jeez.
[167:32.90]Alright, there's the crane.
[167:33.84]Is there a better crane?
[167:40.61]No, keep the crane on.
[167:41.41]That's what I'm using it for.
[167:42.19]I like that.
[167:56.76]Twisted metal is like missiles.
[167:59.68]Like that.
[168:04.58]Like that.
[168:10.87]I want to be like a fire engine.
[168:11.95]Yeah.
[168:15.04]That's better.
[168:22.58]Alright, cool.
[168:25.54]Let's go pick up those things.
[168:26.64]So now how do I use the crane?
[168:27.78]I'm sure we'll find out.
[168:30.08]Alright.
[168:31.46]We need to go down here.
[168:35.12]This is worth like three or four thousand dollars or something crazy.
[168:40.92]This car is way too big to go in the woods.
[168:42.75]So don't worry, I'm not going to do that.
[168:45.93]Let's go this way.
[168:53.43]I'm going to have to just kind of go around here and up this way, I guess.
[168:59.41]It's really the only way I can really go besides here.
[169:01.33]But is this water?
[169:02.83]I don't think I can drive through this.
[169:09.30]That's definitely the better way to go, but I don't know how deep that is.
[169:12.24]Ice or water?
[169:14.46]Let's try it.
[169:17.12]I'll give it a try.
[169:23.83]This thing's terrible in mud.
[169:27.25]We'll find out.
[169:28.17]I'm going to turn around if I don't want to do it.
[169:36.76]That's a scary horn.
[169:38.82]That's the kind of horn that makes you just jump at the red light.
[169:40.92]That's the kind of horn that gives you a stomach ache.
[169:46.31]It's just so stu- Shit.
[169:51.63]It's okay.
[169:57.31]Is it ice or is it water?
[169:58.83]It looks like- I don't know.
[170:00.21]What?
[170:00.43]It's ice?
[170:00.77]Alright, it's ice.
[170:03.37]I'll be alright.
[170:10.29]I have no control over this car.
[170:17.55]I just held left on the stick as hard as I could.
[170:23.96]Oh lord, hold on.
[170:30.31]Wait, this is always on?
[170:46.43]This is ice, that's fine.
[170:53.69]Facecam, good sir.
[170:57.86]You've earned five minutes of facecam.
[171:02.88]Why would I have to blink my eyes a bunch?
[171:05.00]What a great time to turn it on, when I'm like...
[171:15.72]Okay, I just, like, realized I haven't blinked in, like, an hour.
[171:18.40]And my, like, eyes are watering.
[171:24.98]Yeah, my eyes are, like, full of water right now.
[171:27.18]Anybody else have really watery, liquidy eyes?
[171:29.26]My eyes seem to be so watery all the time.
[171:31.84]If I go outside and it's windy out... At all... Tears will just be streaming down my face.
[171:38.26]Down my cheeks.
[171:41.95]I've got very sensitive eyes.
[171:50.44]Inching your nipples helps with... I'm not even going to finish the sentence.
[172:04.97]I think I can... No, keep it on.
[172:06.16]I don't want to get stuck.
[172:10.58]No, I don't need it.
[172:11.28]It's not that deep.
[172:12.62]This thing's pretty good in off-mud terrain.
[172:17.06]You're a lizard.
[172:17.72]You just lick them.
[172:20.94]I am like a lizard mouth.
[172:22.32]I'm always like kind of moistening my lips.
[172:24.52]I'm always going like this.
[172:25.90]I always bite my lip and I always go like this.
[172:37.21]If I could lick my eyes with my tongue, I probably would do it.
[172:39.43]It'd be like... Happen all the time.
[172:44.15]Capstick Charlie?
[172:45.11]Yeah.
[172:54.06]We're getting there.
[172:54.52]I'm not going that way.
[172:56.32]You're a fucking freak!
[173:10.19]Hey, I still don't have any gray hairs!
[173:16.52]Not that that, like, means anything for what you just said.
[173:19.00]I don't know why.
[173:19.60]I was, like, flexing on you for some reason.
[173:22.16]Like, oh, yeah, well, you ever think of a freak?
[173:23.58]I don't have any gray... I don't know.
[173:25.07]It didn't really correlate together, but whatever.
[173:30.51]I turn 36 really soon, and I don't have any gray hairs.
[173:39.53]You dye your hair.
[173:40.47]I don't dye my hair.
[173:41.21]I'm afraid of dying my hair.
[173:42.19]I feel like it's gonna fall out.
[173:56.43]What about one?
[173:58.58]It already is falling out.
[173:59.54]Yeah, I know it is.
[174:00.40]It is.
[174:00.58]I can't stop that.
[174:03.98]It's called age.
[174:05.99]All the garlic and radishes.
[174:06.97]Don't eat too much garlic.
[174:09.45]Don't eat too many radishes.
[174:11.83]Only eat them when you feel like you want a snack.
[174:16.45]Don't do the YouTuber quirky hair color thing.
[174:20.69]I'm not going to do the YouTuber quirky hair color thing.
[174:23.37]Don't worry.
[174:24.49]I'm not going to do like the hair color YouTuber thing.
[174:32.66]Garlic snack?
[174:38.30]Yeah, well, maybe not nowadays, but like George Washington used to like rub garlic on his feet to like cure his fucking cold.
[174:50.07]You know, garlic has something called allicin in it.
[174:51.93]It's actually really good for you.
[174:54.21]When you crush garlic and it stinks, you're actually smelling the chemical reaction to create allicin.
[175:01.30]It's very, very good for you.
[175:04.96]Look it up.
[175:06.14]It's fine.
[175:06.60]It's alright.
[175:07.29]I'll be the smartest one in the room today.
[175:09.57]Maybe not every day, but today I will be.
[175:16.87]No, A-L-I-C-I-N.
[175:19.10]Not like A-L-I-S-O-N.
[175:23.86]That's suedo science.
[175:25.08]It's not.
[175:25.68]It's like documented fucking proof.
[175:27.28]Alright, let's go.
[175:31.55]You went to the wrong place?
[175:37.05]No, I didn't.
[175:41.63]Yeah, I did.
[175:47.95]Do I need a crane to pick up the logs?
[175:49.61]Timber.
[175:54.61]Log loader crane is recommended.
[175:56.81]Alright, well let's- I'm gonna get him I guess.
[175:58.73]Let's pick him up.
[176:02.60]What?
[176:29.25]Okay.
[176:35.52]Alright.
[176:35.94]Anchor.
[176:36.22]Okay.
[176:41.96]How do I pick it up?
[176:43.78]Attach cargo.
[176:44.50]How do I attach it?
[176:58.34]Pick it up.
[176:59.48]Attach cargo.
[177:00.26]It's the wrong crane.
[177:15.53]Whatever.
[177:15.81]I need a logging crane for the logs.
[177:20.17]Fine.
[177:20.67]I'm just gonna go to the- I'm gonna- We were talking, so I didn't pay attention.
[177:32.15]Let's go.
[177:36.29]Back on the road.
[177:37.15]Let's go.
[177:40.03]Come on.
[177:43.61]Get fired?
[177:44.29]I'm not.
[177:44.63]Put this shit away.
[177:47.33]I'm gonna fix your shit.
[177:54.53]I just did.
[178:01.82]How do you drive with passengers in the car without getting lost?
[178:05.57]That's what GPS is for.
[178:17.33]Garlic's really good for you, though.
[178:21.60]I would say you should add some more... Well, his thing.
[178:25.60]Garlic is very, very harsh for some people.
[178:29.38]You know, if you have acid reflux problems, if you're trying to do kind of like a low FODMAP diet, if you have irritable bowel kind of problems, you don't really want to eat too, too much of it.
[178:39.65]But if you can handle it, it's really, really good for you.
[178:51.86]It's for vampires.
[178:52.68]They have a garlic burger at Burger King.
[178:59.24]I don't think I want that.
[179:02.67]I like fresh garlic.
[179:04.15]Garlic that's fresh.
[179:06.57]Smashed and immediately used.
[179:07.95]Either put in the pan.
[179:09.45]Or on like garlic bread or something.
[179:12.39]I don't know.
[179:13.60]Give me the real stuff.
[179:16.40]I want the real stuff.
[179:17.28]I don't want the fake shit.
[179:19.96]Not saying that it's fake.
[179:20.96]Whatever they use.
[179:21.64]The Burger King or whatever.
[179:22.58]But it's not the real shit.
[179:24.30]They don't smash it in the fucking restaurant.
[179:27.35]What happened?
[179:32.50]Why don't you grow fresh garlic?
[179:34.47]Um... I don't know.
[179:36.48]I never really thought to.
[179:49.82]I'm not saying it's fake.
[179:50.75]I'm just saying it's not real.
[179:51.93]No, I just, it's not, it's real.
[179:54.25]It's not fresh.
[179:56.39]Fresh squeezed, fresh pressed at the restaurant.
[179:58.97]Like somebody just smashes it with a knife and like smashes it with a knife.
[180:01.93]You know, you turn the knife sideways and you smash, spread, spread, spread, spread, smash, spread, spread, spread, spread, sink, sink, sink, sink, smash, spread, spread, spread.
[180:08.84]You know what I'm talking about?
[180:09.58]That's what I do.
[180:10.68]Where are we going?
[180:14.50]Alright, don't be an idiot.
[180:16.59]I gotta go right.
[180:26.18]Hey, watch the road, buddy.
[180:30.82]I'm fine.
[180:33.40]This is the second time I've heard you rant about garlic.
[180:35.66]Because I find it to be an incredibly important addition to your diet.
[180:40.28]Your armpits smell like garlic.
[180:42.14]They do.
[180:42.44]Okay.
[180:42.74]Here's the thing.
[180:45.18]Garlic, like, permeates every inch of your body.
[180:48.05]It, like, crosses your, like, brain barrier.
[180:50.93]And it, like, goes through all your pores, right?
[180:53.77]From what I've read.
[180:54.63]I don't know how true it is.
[180:56.62]So if you eat garlic, you smell like garlic.
[181:04.74]Especially if you eat a lot of it.
[181:05.58]Don't eat too much of it.
[181:08.74]Don't eat too much.
[181:09.30]You shouldn't be eating too much of it anyways.
[181:10.46]This dude's got garlic brain?
[181:18.33]That's what I've heard.
[181:25.87]Garlic just permeates, like, every single, like, cell in your body.
[181:29.73]You become more garlic than person when you eat it.
[181:32.71]It's garlic science.
[181:34.11]It's suede science.
[181:35.09]I don't know.
[181:35.55]Let me just pick up my boxes.
[181:43.04]Okay, here we go.
[181:44.04]Activate anchor.
[181:46.42]Get that crane out.
[181:52.39]Attach the crane.
[181:54.37]Alright.
[181:55.41]Lift it up.
[182:01.26]Why am I moving?
[182:02.80]Why am I moving?
[182:04.42]Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor.
[182:06.76]Anchor in the ground.
[182:07.84]Anchor.
[182:08.14]Let it go.
[182:09.02]What's happening?
[182:13.12]What's wrong with me?
[182:13.62]Put the handbrake on.
[182:21.70]Oh shit, you're right.
[182:22.37]OK.
[182:33.26]Uh.
[182:35.03]How do I get this in the bed?
[183:03.83]I can only put one of these at a time?
[183:05.66]Can I stack them?
[183:10.50]Oh my god.
[183:11.22]I don't even know where this is going.
[183:15.48]Just fucking sleep.
[183:19.79]Thank you.
[183:38.15]Actually, that's better.
[183:38.80]I can get it right in the middle.
[183:40.34]Okay.
[183:53.73]Can I drop it now?
[183:57.09]Wait, lower it down.
[183:58.03]It's almost in there.
[184:02.25]Alright, that's in.
[184:06.42]That's in.
[184:08.30]Alright, there's one.
[184:11.52]Nice.
[184:11.80]Okay.
[184:12.48]Let's get the other one.
[184:22.27]How high can I lift this?
[184:25.61]Let's see how high I can get this first.
[184:26.75]That can go pretty high, actually.
[184:37.38]This might work.
[185:02.15]Ah!
[185:08.66]It's kind of hard to tell which direction... Okay, no, there we go.
[185:10.74]That's better.
[185:23.75]Almost there.
[185:31.88]It's actually on.
[185:34.72]Don't!
[185:44.13]Garlic brain!
[185:45.15]The fucking face cam's staying on, fine.
[186:02.21]How's that for garlic brain, motherfuckers?
[186:07.46]How's that for garlic brain, motherfuckers?
[186:24.56]D Where is this going?
[186:35.83]Where's this going?
[186:40.45]Where's it go?
[186:44.40]What mission is this?
[186:54.10]Bottom left?
[186:57.31]Log station?
[186:57.97]No, no, that's not the right one.
[186:59.53]Deliver to the sawmill.
[187:00.73]Medium logs.
[187:01.41]Why is that being tracked?
[187:02.19]I don't want that.
[187:05.30]It's the wrong one.
[187:10.16]It was, like, it was up at the garage.
[187:11.92]Yep.
[187:12.18]Okay, here it is.
[187:12.92]No, it's not.
[187:13.70]What was it?
[187:16.02]There it is.
[187:16.44]Okay, here it is.
[187:17.44]Containers in the river.
[187:19.72]Okay, so I need to get over here, back out to the road.
[187:27.07]If I pull this off, this is a huge deal for me.
[187:35.05]Let's go.
[187:38.99]Get off, get off.
[187:39.83]No more.
[187:45.99]I didn't think it was gonna happen immediately.
[188:01.19]No, I was so ready.
[188:03.13]Wait.
[188:06.07]God damn it.
[188:06.75]I was like, if I was slow...
[188:10.13]If I was actually slow enough, I... It was just not centered.
[188:14.62]God damn it.
[188:15.54]I'm so pissed.
[188:18.50]I can't believe it.
[188:19.32]It's because I turned the face cam off.
[188:20.96]Yeah, because I was like, so I don't want anyone to look at me.
[188:22.66]Don't look at my face.
[188:23.94]Nobody look at me.
[188:25.76]Nobody look at me.
[188:27.36]Nobody look at me.
[188:28.85]Who is that?
[188:29.27]That's a character from like a Christmas show.
[188:32.55]What is that?
[188:34.46]Asleep in my class in broad daylight.
[188:38.54]That's from Heart of Darkness.
[188:39.62]Heart of Darkness video that I made.
[188:40.98]Might as well... Yeah, that's what it is.
[188:47.34]I'm so mad that I have to do this.
[188:52.61]I'm so pissed.
[188:53.71]I really thought I was going to be able to do it.
[188:56.31]And you got like a Mario's ass went into the fire sound effect too.
[188:59.15]Great.
[189:00.27]Okay, well...
[189:05.03]I guess we're gonna recover.
[189:06.01]Aye, aye, aye.
[189:12.70]Just leave Alaska.
[189:14.46]No, I have to do that.
[189:18.62]I'm gonna get these.
[189:19.68]Because, like, I'm not gonna let it just fucking beat me.
[189:21.50]I'm sorry.
[189:30.82]Sleeping in my class in broad daylight.
[189:34.61]Daylight.
[189:35.29]Daylight.
[189:36.27]Daylight.
[189:37.11]There it is.
[189:42.93]Enable Ayaya.
[189:46.67]Is it like 2017 again?
[189:48.71]Is it 2016?
[189:48.92]What are you talking about?
[189:55.48]Oh, this is actually really important.
[189:57.34]Have I ever done the...
[190:01.04]Record scratch Aaron thing.
[190:03.72]I've been working on it for a while.
[190:04.84]So I've done it, right?
[190:11.01]I have.
[190:11.21]Yep.
[190:11.57]Good.
[190:12.05]Alright.
[190:12.25]Just making sure.
[190:25.42]If you're going to play No More Heroes 3, Ayaya is crucial.
[190:29.08]It's not.
[190:30.83]Yes, I didn't?
[190:32.98]I feel like I did.
[190:41.28]You haven't.
[190:42.55]I haven't?
[190:44.61]Someone that goes... I've never done that?
[191:03.11]Well, now I have, so now you can remember it.
[191:07.60]You've done that before.
[191:08.46]I'm sure I have.
[191:09.80]Yeah, what are you guys talking about?
[191:11.50]Remember, you don't have to spend $100,000 to entertain us.
[191:16.24]Well, about that.
[191:38.99]Got the price wrong.
[191:57.06]That was a dad laugh?
[192:03.83]I said this in the pre-stream, and I'll say it again.
[192:06.85]It's not about how much money a stream costs.
[192:09.35]It's, is it fun to do?
[192:11.37]Is it worth trying?
[192:13.08]I don't care if I spend $100 for a stream, or $100 million.
[192:17.28]As long as it's an idea that I think is fun, that I want to do.
[192:21.72]And I'm stuck.
[192:22.26]Doesn't matter.
[192:25.43]Look, if I can do it, I'll try.
[192:26.47]Right?
[192:27.51]I don't care.
[192:32.23]I actually am stuck, though.
[192:33.11]I'm just realizing.
[192:34.13]Okay, I'm going to have to winch.
[192:45.52]Come on.
[192:49.20]This sucks.
[192:57.85]There we go.
[193:01.22]This was a horrible way to go.
[193:02.98]I... Dollhouse frame is going to be living in my head rent-free for years.
[193:12.43]Well, um... That makes me happy.
[193:14.97]Well, not that it's like... I don't know.
[193:15.77]Living in your head rent-free is like a... Isn't that like a... Don't you not want that?
[193:19.89]Um... I don't know.
[193:23.55]If you thought it was fun, then that makes me happy.
[193:25.23]That's all I care about.
[193:27.47]I really mean that.
[193:32.27]I'd like to get out of the mud, though.
[193:42.07]I'm so close.
[193:42.61]Alright, pull myself up with this.
[193:44.08]What the hell are you doing?
[193:45.20]Come on.
[193:55.26]I'm going the right way, right?
[193:56.74]Okay.
[193:57.24]This is such a dumb way.
[193:58.21]I was driving.
[193:59.45]Whatever, just go.
[194:05.15]Don't be modest.
[194:06.13]You knew it was going to be a great stream.
[194:07.93]That's... If you watched the behind the scenes show yesterday.
[194:12.78]That's not necessarily guaranteed.
[194:15.96]It could have been very bad.
[194:17.72]It could have been a disaster.
[194:19.76]We could have had extension problems.
[194:22.95]We could have had... Because we were doing it for three days.
[194:25.53]Is it going to still be even interesting after the first day?
[194:28.35]There was a lot of potential for it to not really be that fun.
[194:35.60]yeah it could have been awful so did I think it was going to be worth doing absolutely and everybody involved was so into it that's that's how you know that the project's probably a good idea
[194:59.84]when every single person that's working on it is like, this is really fun.
[195:03.97]Like, we were having, we were actually, we were all having a lot of fun during that week.
[195:08.51]And the weeks before, too.
[195:12.18]So, if, as long as what some of you guys got out of that stream was, you thought it was interesting, you thought it was fun, you had a good time participating, and everybody on the crew and the set had a good time, too, that's, that's a win for me.
[195:31.30]And I really hope to do way more stuff like that in the future, too.
[195:35.38]But there's no... I want to make this really clear, kind of how I started this part of the conversation.
[195:39.44]I don't ever want people to think, Holy shit, the dollhouse!
[195:44.05]Oh, man, he's gonna have to do something even bigger than that next time.
[195:48.71]That's kind of not the goal.
[195:51.43]There will be huge projects like that.
[195:54.07]Maybe, like, hopefully I try to do... Go to once or twice a year.
[195:58.10]But there's other stuff that does not have to be that scale that I really want to do, that I think would be fun to do.
[196:04.85]Like I've said before, I might just call Jake like tomorrow and be like, hey, I kind of want to, what's going on in a couple weeks?
[196:11.25]You want to do something?
[196:12.43]I have this idea.
[196:13.09]It doesn't have to be an elaborate, huge production, right?
[196:16.51]Alright, let's try this again.
[196:25.10]And we had significant backing from Twitch and from Coinbase.
[196:31.11]And I would like for those, I mean, if it's possible, right?
[196:34.01]I mean, you can't, you know, I hope that it continues.
[196:37.75]But if I can get the capital and get the funding and the money to be able to do stuff like that, you're going to see stuff like that way more than you, way more often if I can.
[197:00.89]There we go.
[197:01.27]Are you doing better medically?
[197:06.97]Oh, sure.
[197:07.89]Because now I can kind of just relax and we can talk about this very briefly.
[197:11.43]And I'm going to fall over again into the fucking water.
[197:14.76]The medical thing that I was talking about like a week before the stream was actually really, really annoying.
[197:19.12]It's something I have to deal with now.
[197:22.96]So...
[197:24.44]It was a very stressful week leading up to the Dollhouse stream.
[197:28.60]Not just because the Dollhouse stream was happening, but, um, I started to get dizzy and feel, like, pressure in my head.
[197:37.69]And it was like, don't even fucking tell me this is something else that's gonna start here.
[197:42.07]Uh, so, I had to go in and get, like, an MRI of my head.
[197:47.85]This is literally four or five days before the show.
[197:51.87]And thankfully, there was nothing really majorly wrong, but I have cysts in my sinuses.
[198:03.38]And I guess that can potentially cause the problems that I was having.
[198:08.16]So I have to get those removed.
[198:09.96]So I have to go to like an ENT and actually get some type of surgery, I think, to remove them.
[198:17.71]And they were not there before, because those of you that have been keeping up with the channel for a long time, at least the last year or two, I had a brain and head MRI because of the unrelated other problem, right?
[198:28.07]Like a year ago.
[198:29.79]And this was not there a year ago.
[198:32.86]So this is new.
[198:34.60]So I have to just kind of go in, and I was essentially told, yeah, you're going to have to go to an ENT, and they're going to have to get a better look.
[198:40.40]And I'm just probably going to have to get them removed.
[198:42.82]So...
[198:44.25]Apparently, it's very, very simple.
[198:46.01]It's a, thankfully, very easy thing to do.
[198:49.29]And I'm not, like, in any pain or anything.
[198:50.78]Like, don't get me wrong.
[198:52.14]I'm fine completely.
[198:53.66]It was just, I think it's, like, putting weird pressure in my sinuses.
[198:58.72]So, yeah.
[199:00.52]But I wanted to kind of give you guys sort of what was going on there.
[199:03.12]Because it was kind of weird.
[199:04.74]I'm just like, oh, yeah, I can't stream for, like, a week.
[199:07.88]Sorry.
[199:08.22]I got, like, an unrelated other issue going on.
[199:10.02]And people were kind of like, what the fuck?
[199:12.15]What are you talking about?
[199:15.11]What now?
[199:16.15]So, let me clear the air on that, that, like, I'm fine.
[199:19.11]But I do have... They're called, like, Maxillory... They have an insane, like, five-syllable name.
[199:27.31]It's like... Something about maximiliterally sinus... Let me see what it is.
[199:33.96]Maxi... What's it called?
[199:36.80]Maximus?
[199:41.82]Somebody knows what it is.
[199:45.14]Mucus retention cysts in your maxima... Yeah, there you go.
[199:53.19]Maxillary... Maxillary sinus retention cyst.
[199:57.67]There you are.
[200:05.88]It's a mouthful, yeah.
[200:11.64]Bro, no offense, but your body is making me angry.
[200:20.99]Yeah, me too.
[200:22.57]I'll be honest.
[200:24.65]But, yeah.
[200:25.41]I'm good.
[200:25.87]Don't worry.
[200:27.31]I'm going to be probably going in next week to see an ENT.
[200:29.53]We're just going to just get rid of them.
[200:32.41]And then those problems will probably go away.
[200:38.77]Maximus.
[200:42.01]Alright, let me get back to this.
[200:45.91]It's definitely not the garlic.
[200:48.55]He's still going to have the hernia surgery.
[200:49.89]Probably.
[200:51.53]Yeah.
[200:53.01]Just to see if it fixes anything or helps anything.
[200:55.68]I forgot how to play the game.
[200:57.16]How do I play the game?
[201:00.66]What's... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[201:02.14]This is gonna be bad if I don't... Did I... This is not gonna happen again, is it?
[201:08.62]I think it is.
[201:09.46]I'm... Oh, no.
[201:11.26]This is gonna happen again.
[201:12.52]Wait.
[201:13.99]Put this... Put this away.
[201:20.47]Take it easy.
[201:24.98]What happened?
[201:27.48]What happened?
[201:28.10]How does it?
[201:32.00]Hernia Andy.
[201:34.12]Andy.
[201:34.48]Why do I say that like that?
[201:35.37]What's wrong with my voice?
[201:36.91]Hernia Andy.
[201:40.71]That scared the shit out of me, and I pressed it.
[201:42.67]Alright.
[201:50.75]Pull me out, please.
[201:58.98]What the fuck?
[202:02.30]I'm about to just say who cares about this mission because now I can't do anything.
[202:06.20]I have to attach the this and spin me around.
[202:08.14]Oh my god, I'm going over.
[202:18.29]Oh no no no no no no no no.
[202:29.54]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[202:32.72]I didn't.
[202:33.24]I'm not coming back here again.
[202:35.94]I'm not coming back here.
[202:54.45]Get the fuck out of here.
[202:55.23]Come on.
[202:57.34]Stay up.
[202:58.46]No, stay up.
[202:59.44]Stay up.
[202:59.90]Stay up.
[203:00.26]It's like a giant kickstand.
[203:01.66]Stay up!
[203:07.91]Come on.
[203:09.55]Am I up?
[203:10.73]I am.
[203:11.31]Alright.
[203:11.61]Don't go into the fucking water, please.
[203:24.42]Okay.
[203:25.80]Well, that was annoying.
[203:38.71]Galaxy brain.
[203:57.23]Top gamer moment of 2021.
[203:58.83]No, I think getting out of the forest deserves that slot.
[204:05.56]So I got a question about No More Heroes 3.
[204:08.33]I've been really anticipating that game for a few years now.
[204:11.01]Is it good?
[204:12.61]Be honest with me.
[204:13.51]I need to know.
[204:14.57]I need to know if it's good.
[204:15.91]Is it good?
[204:19.74]I'm not reading reviews on it.
[204:21.02]I don't want to know anything about it.
[204:22.12]Besides, is it good?
[204:23.18]Is it good?
[204:26.94]It's fucking amazing.
[204:28.44]I've heard it was good.
[204:29.08]Okay.
[204:32.29]It's great.
[204:32.87]Perhaps.
[204:33.95]No Mega Lull.
[204:37.74]Ups and downs, but it's good.
[204:39.26]Because I heard it was long.
[204:40.36]Alright, is that in there?
[204:48.11]Not really.
[204:49.79]Shit.
[204:50.13]Alright, move.
[204:51.17]Just turn it.
[204:58.95]Oh my god.
[204:59.81]Put it down.
[205:00.25]Fuck.
[205:10.75]Come on, can I just tilt it in there so it slides in?
[205:19.05]Aye, aye, aye.
[205:19.71]Alright, well, handbrake.
[205:20.49]Come on.
[205:23.27]You should play Travis Strikes Again.
[205:24.71]The only reason why I didn't want to play Travis Strikes Again is because I heard that game was even longer.
[205:30.74]And it's like a top-down game, right?
[205:35.36]Isn't Travis Strikes Again like 30 hours?
[205:39.34]I don't... I don't know if I want to do that.
[205:53.23]Come on.
[205:54.59]Ah!
[205:59.51]That was awful.
[206:02.13]I can't do that three and a half hours into the stream after talking.
[206:04.31]That was really bad.
[206:07.42]Oh yeah, you can oof.
[206:08.62]That was an oof.
[206:09.16]It was horrible.
[206:09.64]Alright, do we go for the other one?
[206:17.00]Come on, let's do it.
[206:19.23]Let's go.
[206:34.78]How do I actually move this thing down?
[206:39.32]Ah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.
[206:40.52]No, stop, stop.
[206:41.18]You're right.
[206:41.84]Turn it off.
[206:45.02]I'm leaving.
[206:51.12]Now we gotta go this way.
[206:53.38]Straight ahead, bang a left.
[206:54.80]Okay.
[206:55.34]Be careful.
[207:00.32]Pack.
[207:00.86]Pack the bloody cargo.
[207:02.06]Pack the bloody cargo.
[207:03.14]Pack the bloody cargo.
[207:06.45]Oh, shit.
[207:06.93]I can do that.
[207:07.41]Alright.
[207:07.79]I packed the bloody cargo.
[207:25.19]This thing's really heavy.
[207:25.93]Alright, easy.
[207:42.08]Yeah, there's no way I would have been able to do two.
[207:49.09]Not a chance.
[207:51.45]This mission sucks.
[207:52.55]How much money do I even get?
[207:53.33]Like three grand?
[207:54.79]It seems like not enough for how annoying this is.
[208:12.18]It just says you suck.
[208:15.47]I like that.
[208:16.01]I like that person.
[208:32.73]Have you listened to Donda?
[208:35.91]I, I... Oi, oi, oi, oi.
[208:40.91]Handbrake, handbrake, handbrake, handbrake, handbrake.
[208:45.67]Oh god.
[208:46.13]Alright, we're good.
[208:57.94]Uh, I have not.
[209:04.25]I'm just gonna attach the winch.
[209:06.11]I'm not gonna... No bullshit here.
[209:14.44]Pull it.
[209:20.86]Why is this breaking?
[209:21.56]Stop breaking the trees, you idiot.
[209:23.26]This shit's too heavy.
[209:31.27]I can't do this.
[209:36.32]Oh, God.
[209:36.92]I can't... You know, I was supposed to upgrade my cars before I did this.
[209:46.43]That's absolutely sure.
[209:47.85]Come on.
[209:59.34]Come on, then.
[210:03.54]Come on, then.
[210:06.11]It's too heavy.
[210:09.43]It's just too heavy.
[210:10.05]It's too heavy.
[210:11.17]Now I'm in a lot of trouble.
[210:12.79]Now what do I do?
[210:13.15]I'm just going to have to pull myself the whole way.
[210:23.21]All wheel drive.
[210:23.73]All wheel drive I think is on by default on this one.
[210:25.78]Alright, there we go.
[210:27.06]I'm alright.
[210:30.16]I'm on.
[210:30.64]You can get through.
[210:34.72]Am I going to play No More Heroes 3 all the way through?
[210:36.38]That's the plan.
[210:39.02]We'll see, though.
[210:42.63]This weekend, when I start it, we're going to do probably Friday, Saturday, or Saturday, Sunday.
[210:47.41]Keep an eye on the sus, you'll see.
[210:51.03]And after that, I'll see how far I am, if I have another stream's worth.
[210:54.30]Probably just try to finish it the next day or a few days later or something.
[211:00.25]And then we do have The Sims 3 mod hell that I had actually all ready to go before Dollhouse.
[211:06.69]But I didn't want to be a... I didn't want to just do The Sims only for like a month.
[211:14.68]So that's ready to go.
[211:18.07]Wait, he actually is the sus guy.
[211:19.93]Thank you.
[211:22.05]That's right.
[211:23.61]Okay.
[211:23.73]Okay.
[211:32.52]I love how that person had to search for that.
[211:34.90]They looked it up.
[211:35.64]They were like, wait a minute.
[211:36.42]No way.
[211:42.20]Did I just get that person starstruck?
[211:45.90]Are you?
[211:47.14]Can you believe it?
[211:48.58]That's right.
[211:48.92]It's me.
[211:56.76]How do I unload this?
[212:20.05]Do the face.
[212:21.02]It's not even my face.
[212:22.38]How do I... Attach the card?
[212:26.42]Unpack card.
[212:27.10]Okay.
[212:31.14]How do I get rid of this?
[212:37.59]What?
[212:38.05]I have to... I can't... I need both of them attached?
[212:40.39]No, I don't.
[212:44.51]Better not.
[213:04.45]Is that alright?
[213:19.20]Name's Pete.
[213:19.68]I work for a transit company called Alaskan Transit.
[213:22.48]We've had an unfortunate accident.
[213:23.52]It's drilling containers of tools stuck in the river.
[213:25.14]Can you locate them and get them to the base?
[213:28.91]Deliver to the
[213:34.47]Oh, fuck you.
[213:37.12]This is so far away.
[213:47.15]Oh, fuck you.
[213:47.95]Really?
[213:49.17]This is so... This is not worth the three grand.
[213:53.17]Well, I have to put this back in now.
[213:54.77]God.
[213:55.15]Ah.
[213:56.77]Ah.
[214:16.31]Do both!
[214:16.75]Do both!
[214:17.35]Trailer!
[214:17.83]Trailer!
[214:20.47]I don't think I can get a trailer in there.
[214:22.37]With this engine that's in this car.
[214:23.61]See how slow I was?
[214:26.21]I'm gonna get stuck in that little weird spot where I was stuck before.
[214:40.84]No!
[214:41.32]Spin the other way!
[214:42.50]Spin the other way!
[214:45.62]Turn!
[214:50.12]Turn the other way.
[214:51.70]Oh, I'm getting that, like, antsy.
[214:53.20]I'm just, like, want to shake and stuff.
[214:54.74]You know what I mean?
[214:55.20]You ever get that?
[214:55.66]I just want to start shaking around.
[214:57.40]Oh.
[215:06.39]Okay.
[215:09.71]I could have just done that.
[215:11.47]Really?
[215:16.59]I don't want to deliver this all the way to the port.
[215:18.21]That sucks.
[215:29.13]Alright, first thing somebody puts in chat is what I'm going to eat.
[215:33.39]And it better be Burger King long chicken sandwich.
[215:39.90]Soy.
[215:40.49]No, never mind.
[217:15.79]Hi.
[217:16.27]Hello.
[217:16.61]How are you?
[217:19.33]Sorry about that.
[217:21.49]You should be good to go.
[217:24.75]I'm going to need a refresh chat, though.
[217:27.04]This chat crashed.
[217:31.20]I'd like a chat refresh.
[217:32.68]Clear chat.
[217:41.38]Yeah, that was my fault.
[217:45.50]That was my fault.
[217:46.18]Give me one sec.
[217:57.98]There you are.
[217:58.70]Okay.
[218:01.65]What did you do?
[218:05.31]Uh, my VPN was on.
[218:07.70]And I had it on a... I had it on a bad... Um... I had it on a server I shouldn't have been on.
[218:14.08]That was my fault.
[218:17.38]Sorry about that.
[218:19.40]Oh my fucking god.
[218:20.74]Don't tell me that that's gonna ruin everything.
[218:22.16]No, I'm good.
[218:31.05]He did pirate the game.
[218:32.31]No.
[218:33.13]No.
[218:38.22]What does that mean?
[218:38.92]That means that some VP... I thought that was on fire.
[218:40.82]Uh, some VPN servers can get, like, junky.
[218:44.28]Especially at certain times of day, certain times of night.
[218:47.48]And I was on one of the ones that was, uh, junky.
[218:49.83]So that was my own fault.
[218:51.89]New objective.
[218:53.41]What is... Can I not go across this bridge?
[218:57.25]Oh, come on.
[218:58.09]What?
[218:58.39]How am I supposed to get to the port if I can't go... How am I supposed to get over there?
[219:05.13]I can't go... Oh...
[219:14.84]Are you serious?
[219:16.52]I think I can drive over that.
[219:19.18]I'm just gonna have to leave this here.
[219:22.48]Alright.
[219:23.10]They say it's permanent, so I'm just gonna unpack it and leave it here.
[219:28.52]That's why you take the scout first.
[219:29.96]Yeah, I know that you're right.
[219:32.50]I'm starting to understand how the game is played now.
[219:36.26]You don't just drive around with the big guns.
[219:37.70]You have to take the little guy.
[219:41.83]You gotta go take your, um...
[219:47.37]Hold on.
[219:47.91]I swear I'll make a reference in a few seconds when I figure out how to get my fingers out of my eyeballs.
[219:58.26]Like the Humvee in Red Alert.
[220:00.74]You just drive around with it.
[220:01.72]Who cares if that car explodes?
[220:03.62]You're looking for where their base is.
[220:06.92]There.
[220:07.45]Okay, I got it out.
[220:09.11]Don't.
[220:11.35]Do not.
[220:19.39]are you talking about why did you just die why did the engine stall I'm alright give me the scout I'm just gonna drive around the scout at least I got the cargo out
[220:50.03]Alright, give me this thing.
[220:52.03]I'm going out with the truck.
[220:56.10]Let's go.
[220:56.44]Get this thing on all-wheel drive and let's fucking just hammer it.
[221:00.88]Let's move.
[221:09.73]I'm gonna drive.
[221:10.49]I feel like I haven't completed a mission in like an hour.
[221:16.71]Um...
[221:20.23]Can I take it this way?
[221:21.93]I'm going up.
[221:22.89]Yeah, we'll go.
[221:23.35]I'm going this way.
[221:29.46]Let's take a little scenic drive here.
[221:30.92]And just see what we find.
[221:33.16]I'm just going to take a little drive.
[221:34.58]Let's go.
[221:44.16]Plenty of gas.
[221:44.82]I'm ready.
[221:46.86]I just looked over and it said I was live for four minutes and I was like, how is that possible?
[221:50.78]I actually thought I was only live for four minutes.
[221:53.62]It's like, I am on drugs.
[221:58.48]What are you, how is that possible?
[222:00.14]No way!
[222:05.05]Because I've been live for about four hours and it says four minutes.
[222:10.05]Like, is my concept of time just ruined forever?
[222:32.70]I feel like I'm really gonna get into No More Heroes 3.
[222:34.32]It says 3 hours and 43 minutes for me.
[222:50.47]I gotta get those chain tires for real.
[223:04.35]We politely say what his shirt says.
[223:06.87]Sure.
[223:08.33]Uh, this is a shirt from, uh, Omega Mart.
[223:15.57]The Meow Wolf exhibit in Vegas here.
[223:29.32]Omega LOL Mart.
[223:30.46]Yes, I knew of, of course.
[223:45.17]Is it as awesome as it looks?
[223:46.65]Yes.
[223:50.67]I can safely tell you that this is a Meow Wolf in like three or four different cities.
[223:58.45]It absolutely is worth it.
[224:00.26]It's amazing.
[224:02.72]I'm not going to say anything.
[224:03.70]I don't want to talk about it because there's a lot of interesting things going on when you do it.
[224:08.98]But it was really, really cool.
[224:10.50]Really.
[224:10.78]What the flying fuck, dude?
[224:12.50]I can't go anywhere.
[224:16.45]A rock slide?
[224:17.35]What do you mean a rock slide?
[224:23.01]Somebody just suit up and save the day.
[224:35.04]I'm going around it.
[224:45.40]Now what?
[224:48.79]Rock obstacle.
[224:55.90]Shipment of cargo.
[224:56.70]Oh, oh, oh, never mind.
[224:57.64]I thought I couldn't go around it.
[224:58.84]For some reason, I thought it was like, you can't go around.
[225:04.19]Sorry.
[225:04.61]No more swearing.
[225:05.29]Okay, fine.
[225:06.05]I won't.
[225:06.83]I promise.
[225:18.49]Can we say what the shirt says, not where you got it from?
[225:20.87]The shirt says, thank you, a bunch of times.
[225:23.63]Here, look.
[225:27.56]I mean, it's flipped, but here.
[225:35.74]I'll flip it for you.
[225:36.40]The shirt says, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[225:43.80]And then there's an image of the Omega Mart.
[225:48.41]I like the shirt, I think it looks good.
[225:58.85]I'm not gonna do the sus face.
[226:10.01]Uh, I'm sorry to really break everybody's magic here.
[226:14.07]The sus face is a computer generated image that's not even my face.
[226:19.17]It's my eyes and hair.
[226:22.73]And the rest is a weird stretched out CGI or something.
[226:29.63]What's this?
[226:34.57]Gas over there and factory that way too.
[226:38.61]Oh, shit.
[226:41.97]There is a... Okay, there's a tower over here.
[226:43.57]Let's see if I can get the tower.
[226:58.09]Ooh.
[227:00.39]This looks like a clock.
[227:01.33]I definitely don't want to do this.
[227:03.97]Contest.
[227:08.27]People say you're one of the best drivers around.
[227:09.79]Maybe, maybe not.
[227:10.41]How about a little challenge to see if you can beat my record?
[227:17.48]Okay.
[227:18.86]Reach point A. Oh my god.
[227:25.87]um okay hold on uh I guess I'll let's go what how much time do I have
[227:58.20]How am I supposed to get up there?
[227:59.22]Do I turn my headlights on?
[228:04.21]What's, what's headlights?
[228:04.99]Fuck, my eyes.
[228:19.69]Dude, you can't do this.
[228:22.29]No, you, nobody can, this is impossible.
[228:25.28]I need a moped.
[228:28.96]I really don't think I can do this.
[228:39.82]No, I don't know.
[228:40.58]Whatever.
[228:40.84]I think it can count the whole time.
[228:43.48]I don't care.
[228:59.28]I was wondering if you were ever going to eat a big hot dog on stream.
[229:08.87]You want to hear one of the stream ideas that never happened that would have been maybe funny for like maybe five minutes?
[229:15.13]I wanted to do an eating contest of like steaks or hot dogs or whatever.
[229:21.75]like a coney island thing and the only reason why I thought it was funny is one of the contestants has a fork and knife and is eating it really slowly he's just enjoying like a dinner and he eats just one that was it don't get stuck don't get stuck don't get stuck don't get stuck don't get stuck don't get stuck don't get stuck
[229:53.37]Um, it's over.
[229:54.49]I'm stuck.
[229:57.45]Maybe not.
[229:58.11]Hold on, I'm almost through it.
[230:02.65]Come on, we gotta go muddin'!
[230:03.81]Come on!
[230:05.79]That's an actual Family Guy joke?
[230:08.67]It probably is.
[230:09.17]I didn't do it.
[230:11.74]Obviously, like, I just was like, nah, never mind.
[230:19.70]That's a TikTok skit.
[230:22.44]Were you guys around when I said that I thought I think I'd be huge on TikTok?
[230:26.82]If I gave it really an effort.
[230:38.81]I think I would be the biggest thing on TikTok.
[230:41.20]Ever.
[230:44.13]Like, if you rewound the clock, and I just started, and it's like 10 years ago, but it's now, and I'm like 22, 23, 24, 25, I would be the number one most subscribed person on TikTok, guaranteed.
[230:56.56]Guarantee you.
[231:06.77]What an ego.
[231:08.89]No, I'm just saying.
[231:14.67]You know the dances I could do?
[231:19.09]Imagine me coming out with a new dance every week.
[231:22.91]You know they're gonna be number one in the world?
[231:36.58]Travel to Mountain River?
[231:37.98]Holy shit, wait a minute.
[231:39.71]This is a new zone.
[231:43.30]okay maybe not the biggest thing in the world but I would be at least the most subscribed I'd be the most subscribed person on tiktok from like people in New Hampshire or something you know what I mean like I'd have something I'd have that I'd be able to claim that new zone wait this isn't a new zone
[232:17.69]Show us a dance right now to prove it.
[232:19.76]No, I can't show you a dance right now to prove it because I don't have pants on.
[232:27.08]Restore the bridge, right?
[232:30.14]I'm just taking quests every time I see one.
[232:32.10]Wait, hold on.
[232:32.70]I just need to know.
[232:39.32]Can I explode this car?
[232:45.20]I don't think I can even drive through this.
[232:54.46]250 million off the debt if you make a TikTok.
[232:57.04]No, make it way more than that.
[233:02.42]It needs to be way more than that.
[233:06.67]Nope.
[233:07.19]Nope.
[233:07.83]This is lowball bullshit.
[233:13.93]I will agree to creating a TikTok and making one TikTok a week for the next
[233:22.44]Well, starting... No.
[233:24.64]I literally don't feel like doing that right now.
[233:26.50]Starting, like, next week.
[233:28.28]I just don't feel like doing that.
[233:29.68]Like, I'm just gonna be honest.
[233:33.46]Why am I sliding?
[233:42.90]What the fuck?
[233:49.66]What's wrong with the car?
[233:52.49]Close functions.
[233:53.31]What?
[233:54.67]Alright.
[233:55.13]Enough of the bullshit.
[233:55.73]Let's go.
[233:58.47]Clear the debt.
[234:03.08]I want to see what the service hub is.
[234:04.14]I want to go here.
[234:09.00]200 million per TikTok.
[234:10.90]But the TikTok has to get over 2k likes?
[234:13.62]Oh, fuck that.
[234:18.25]Come on.
[234:23.19]I would have to hop on every trend on TikTok.
[234:27.55]Although that's kind of funny though.
[234:28.75]Alright, we're fine.
[234:55.05]2k likes isn't much.
[234:56.15]That's kind of a lot, isn't it?
[235:02.42]Did I ever tell you guys the idea of how I wanted to make a children's YouTube channel and not tell anyone?
[235:08.66]Never speak a word of it and try to get like a billion fucking views on it.
[235:13.65]God, I wish I was able to do that.
[235:15.39]I wish I was.
[235:18.68]Just make, like, a real good, like, children's YouTube channel that was, like, really, really well made.
[235:24.86]And don't tell any of you guys.
[235:27.50]Until somebody had to find it.
[235:28.64]There's still time.
[235:33.54]Maybe one day.
[235:36.85]I wouldn't be Jerma.
[235:37.71]I would be, like, Mr. Happy.
[235:39.79]I don't know.
[235:40.81]I wouldn't be me.
[235:42.09]So you wouldn't be able to type in, like, Jerma children's channel.
[235:44.75]No, that wouldn't work.
[235:47.75]And try to be more popular than this channel here.
[235:57.31]I feel like I could pro- I think I could do it.
[236:01.79]Oh, what?
[236:02.15]Like, I- I- Really?
[236:03.24]I gotta dial back the narcissism here.
[236:06.08]Yeah, I think I could have a billion view children's channel.
[236:08.32]I'd be the biggest TikToker in the world.
[236:11.10]Oh, Jeremy, right.
[236:11.86]Is this anything you can't do?
[236:17.73]I can't move.
[236:18.25]I think I'm stuck on a log.
[236:30.60]Yeah, I'm stuck on a log.
[236:37.12]Actually, there's a shitload of stuff that I can't do.
[236:40.14]A lot.
[236:41.08]Like, a lot, a lot.
[236:49.69]Alright, come on.
[236:52.97]That was a bunch of bullshit.
[236:53.77]There we go.
[236:54.75]I want to see what's down here.
[237:01.48]I might be in trouble here.
[237:04.44]Maybe it's time to wind down and stop the stream.
[237:10.70]No, I want to at least do one...
[237:18.57]I wanted to get to here.
[237:19.63]I can get out of here.
[237:22.74]Where are Andy?
[237:23.48]Yeah, that's me.
[237:29.24]Go back to Michigan.
[237:30.14]You know what?
[237:30.56]That's a great idea.
[237:32.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[237:33.25]I'm gonna do that.
[237:48.23]OK.
[237:50.47]Leave garage can I just can I fast travel?
[237:57.40]How do I fast travel?
[237:58.54]There was a menu I could go to before it was in the garage.
[238:04.75]Where is it?
[238:11.69]What did I get to that menu before?
[238:22.33]Do I have to just drive there?
[238:23.39]No.
[238:24.13]You can't drive from Alaska to Michigan.
[238:26.67]Can you?
[238:26.99]Yeah, you can.
[238:37.46]You gotta drive through Canada, though.
[238:41.13]I gotta go to the garage.
[238:42.45]The actual garage.
[238:56.50]Mr. Slime.
[238:57.82]Yeah, there's been a couple of concepts over the years of I just put a shitload of time into something and never tell you about it and hope that eventually you figure it out after like a year.
[239:07.92]And every time I come up with one of these things I think is funny, I always have to go back to the fact that I have to do that thing.
[239:14.28]Like, I would have to stream as Mr. Slime TV like six hours a day.
[239:20.23]Just actually stream.
[239:22.31]For like a year.
[239:25.32]That's like, I don't even stream that much on my own channel.
[239:34.58]Okay, so now we gotta go to map.
[239:41.01]I can go here.
[239:44.39]Oh shit, I can go anywhere I want now.
[239:45.93]Yukon.
[239:48.03]Let's go back to Michigan.
[239:49.03]Michigan.
[239:54.36]Think of the profits.
[239:58.55]I don't know if there would be very many profits.
[240:04.45]Okay, let's go.
[240:04.83]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[240:08.53]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[240:09.65]We don't.
[240:16.23]I have to move to garage, right?
[240:17.47]Okay.
[240:17.59]Okay.
[240:26.77]You ever finish the TikTok discussion?
[240:28.57]I don't think there's much else to discuss.
[240:31.73]Dual Twitch personality.
[240:44.24]Yeah.
[240:53.97]I think it'd be funny for a little while, but then, here's the problem with that.
[240:57.50]Both of these ideas.
[240:59.50]Who gets to take priority?
[241:02.02]Let's say that Mr. Slime TV, right, or whatever his name is, gets to a point where he's pulling 10k viewers a stream.
[241:11.50]What do I do?
[241:13.30]Who do I even, who am I?
[241:14.92]Who should I stream with?
[241:17.30]If the children's YouTube channel has a billion views, like, that's, I would have to, I have to prioritize it.
[241:29.84]Let's get this here.
[241:31.58]Did I already get this one?
[241:34.56]No, I don't think so.
[241:39.40]Just sell out completely.
[241:41.04]Just have one of my streamer personalities be the ultimate sellout and they just sell a shitload of merch and sponsor space and like bounties and shit.
[241:55.67]That's so fucked up, but it's funny.
[242:02.32]Wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel.
[242:12.98]I want that guy timed out.
[242:14.58]For a day!
[242:15.82]No, don't actually do that.
[242:23.60]This is dangerous.
[242:25.50]But, it's kind of the way I have to go.
[242:32.91]What the fuck?
[242:33.53]What?
[242:36.11]What the fuck?
[242:36.59]What the fuck?
[242:37.01]Why is everyone saying what the fuck?
[242:43.82]That was literally the worst noise.
[242:49.68]Was it?
[242:49.98]Dude, you fucked up, bro.
[243:00.55]Yeah, yeah, hey, you fucked up, bro.
[243:03.45]You fucked up, dude.
[243:05.51]Go listen to it.
[243:06.63]Somebody, let me play it.
[243:07.94]Let me see it.
[243:27.39]Any, any clips?
[243:30.01]Dying human goose, baby.
[243:36.06]Wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel.
[243:43.43]Not that bad.
[244:01.42]It sounded like a seagull.
[244:02.50]It sounded like a seagull with like a big dog bone in his throat or something.
[244:08.26]Like in a cartoon, you know, when they swallow the big piece of meat and like in a bone, like it's stuck and it's sticking out of both sides of their skin.
[244:18.55]Like a car horn.
[244:31.85]And when Tom takes a big bite of the meat and he's like... And he's got the bone sticking out of both sides of his neck.
[244:41.56]Why am I driving?
[244:42.36]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[244:57.61]Squidward with a fork in his throat.
[244:59.63]Yeah.
[245:00.57]Yeah.
[245:02.17]That's what it is.
[245:02.73]Yeah, stop it.
[245:03.41]Alright, I'm stopping.
[245:04.61]Ooh, what's over here?
[245:11.35]Okay, I won't do that noise ever again, I promise.
[245:13.53]That happened to Squidward, bro.
[245:18.38]Yeah.
[245:27.84]I won't do that noise again, I promise.
[245:31.95]I promise I won't make that noise ever again unless I eat a gigantic ham on a big bone.
[245:41.40]And it gets stuck in there.
[245:58.87]This is very... Okay.
[246:00.60]You want to hear my final assessment of this game?
[246:08.00]Um... Okay, you ready?
[246:11.76]So, SnowRunner... Sort of reminds me of... When you just take a car... In GTA 5... And just say, fuck it, I don't even care.
[246:22.41]I'm just driving in a random direction.
[246:24.43]Out into the wilderness.
[246:25.89]And they made an entire game based off of it.
[246:30.41]It's pretty cool.
[246:42.74]I was so scared you'd make the sound again.
[246:44.36]I'm not gonna... Look.
[246:46.03]If you get booed and people start throwing tomatoes at you, you don't keep doing the thing that they booed you for.
[246:53.81]I took my boos.
[246:54.73]I said, alright.
[246:56.45]And I moved on.
[247:00.66]Unless I, look, unless I think it's funny, which maybe I do, you might hear it again sometime.
[247:06.89]I've made that sound like a half dozen times before.
[247:10.25]It always gets nominated.
[247:11.23]That sound always is there at the end of the stream.
[247:14.54]Worst of the year awards.
[247:15.60]Always.
[247:16.42]It's every time.
[247:17.94]Go look back at worst sound category.
[247:20.10]I guarantee you that sound is there each time we've done it the last three years.
[247:27.35]It's definitely there.
[247:33.17]This is really pretty.
[247:41.31]Stop making that noise.
[247:44.27]Stop.
[247:44.65]Stop.
[247:44.97]Stop making that sound.
[247:46.03]It's not me doing it.
[248:01.81]The frogs are going like, I'm not gonna do it, but you heard it.
[248:12.93]Can't wait for part two of the Jerma awards.
[248:15.89]Oh yeah, that's right.
[248:27.92]Warehouse.
[248:35.37]Is this what it's really like to drive in one of these?
[248:40.74]This looks like hell.
[248:41.94]This sucks.
[248:46.06]Yeah, it is.
[248:46.86]Do you eat beforehand?
[248:49.76]I hope you don't.
[248:50.72]This is just Turbulence Plane Simulator.
[249:07.44]You eat during it.
[249:08.36]Oh my goodness, this seems so rough.
[249:12.76]Wait, where are we going?
[249:13.94]Ooh, alright, cool.
[249:15.40]I'll go this way.
[249:29.35]I didn't even press- that was my elbow.
[249:30.85]Hold on, we're going through thick- thick mud.
[249:44.49]This is cool.
[249:45.25]This is a cool game.
[249:48.29]I don't know if I'm gonna play this again.
[249:49.43]I probably won't.
[249:50.61]You know, I'm one-off Andy.
[249:53.33]But this... I like this.
[249:54.47]It actually looks pretty cool.
[249:57.42]How much is this game?
[250:05.16]How much is this?
[250:10.99]30 bucks?
[250:16.66]$30?
[250:16.68]Yeah.
[250:17.04]I think that's worth it.
[250:22.08]If you're a truck enthusiast, you love off-roading, you're just kind of exploring and doing the difficult missions of trying to load cargo and go through mud and stuff, I mean, $30 I think is pretty reasonable.
[251:13.10]It's so anti-climactic, it's not even funny.
[251:17.28]I was going for a big finish, and now I'm just stuck.
[251:19.52]That was a- yeah, that's ResidentSleeper.
[251:25.37]Come on.
[251:27.91]Now I just have to call AAA.
[251:29.17]You know what I mean?
[251:31.05]I was going for a big, like, There they go!
[251:38.21]Land and keep driving.
[251:39.87]No.
[251:42.26]Fuck.
[251:43.00]Oh well.
[251:46.33]I can't even press the horn?
[251:47.17]Should've gone faster than 10 miles per hour.
[251:57.79]Alright, let's repair it all.
[252:00.69]Alright, now what?
[252:06.42]Can I turn the engine on?
[252:14.02]What does this guy look like?
[252:18.31]There- Alright, there you go.
[252:19.93]You got what you wanted, everybody that was here.
[252:22.09]You got the impostor's fucking stupid-ass sus face.
[252:26.59]That- You got it.
[252:27.75]I did- I just realized that's what I just did.
[252:30.45]There it is.
[252:31.41]You've been asking for that for like two hours, and I didn't- I just did it.
[252:33.74]There you go.
[252:37.54]Whatever.
[252:39.84]Whatever.
[252:43.43]Did you see that?
[252:52.56]And it was the same exact scenario too.
[252:54.88]Have I learned nothing in the like four years since that picture was taken?
[253:03.75]It was the same, the webcam was off.
[253:06.43]Somebody said, I bet you, what does this guy look like?
[253:09.54]Do a scary face.
[253:10.42]And I turned it on, doing a weird face, and I turned it off immediately.
[253:15.33]We're just in a never-ending circle.
[253:17.35]Is this never gonna end?
[253:34.42]Anyways, dude, sus 2.0 dropped.
[253:38.23]Well, not really.
[253:40.27]And I'm just as sweaty, too.
[253:46.39]Alright, I'm gonna call it here.
[253:50.67]I wanted to stream at least once here until the weekend, because yesterday was like a two-hour Andy with the behind-the-scenes show.
[253:56.29]So I was like, let's just do something tomorrow, too.
[253:58.79]So here we are.
[254:01.08]Actually, I had a lot of fun in this game.
[254:02.44]If I had a little bit more brain power and more patience, I'd probably keep playing it.
[254:08.02]But I will see you guys again.
[254:09.04]We're going to start No More Heroes 3 probably on Friday or Saturday, so in a couple days, two or three days.
[254:18.25]We'll go two days in a row because I'm really actually very excited for that game.
[254:22.49]Very much excited to play it.
[254:26.63]Still kind of coming down from the dollhouse.
[254:29.30]Still, that high is still there, and I'm just sort of trying to pace myself a little bit.
[254:36.98]But thanks for watching.
[254:37.92]We'll see you again some other time.
[254:40.49]Hopefully in a couple days.
[254:44.43]What about Hard Time?
[254:45.43]Hard Time is going to be... I'm going to play it on the iPad, probably.
[254:48.37]Or maybe the PC version, because it was kind of confusing.
[254:50.21]There's like three versions.
[254:52.07]But I was going to do like an MDickey night.
[254:54.41]Because there's two or three games that are only on mobile devices.
[254:58.23]And one of them looks really funny.
[255:00.27]It's a superhero game.
[255:02.17]You make your own superhero, and you live in an MDickey universe.
[255:05.55]So, I mean, I kind of want to play that one.
[255:09.87]So maybe we'll probably just do them all one night.
[255:11.71]Just kind of cycle through them.
[255:19.20]Let me remember how to stream here.
[255:22.20]Here it is.
[255:26.28]Thanks for watching.
[255:27.02]Thanks for the subs.
[255:28.05]There's a lot of them.
[255:28.83]There's a lot, like a lot, a lot now.
[255:32.43]I haven't really had a chance to take a look at my Twitch dashboard.
[255:36.55]But the amount of subscribers here now are way more than I've ever had.
[255:42.99]So...
[255:46.83]I don't even know what to say about this kind of subscription count.
[255:52.17]It's crazy.
[255:54.95]And obviously, I mean, I know this is probably... Even if it's temporary, I don't... I don't know how there's this many people that have given this channel $5 per month.
[256:09.08]But join us on the next one.
[256:11.60]There is plenty more.
[256:15.29]There's at least a few more things this year, hopefully, that come out.
[256:21.25]We'll see you this weekend for No More Heroes 3.
[256:27.45]Wait, 700,000 followers?
[256:29.01]Oh, shit, we did.
[256:35.08]700,000 followers on Twitch.
[256:36.38]That is more than I have YouTube subs on the original YouTube channel, right?
[256:39.92]Is that accurate?
[256:41.42]Let me see.
[256:50.54]No, we're close.
[256:54.67]789,000 subs on YouTube.
[256:56.55]I probably lost a fair amount of subs on this channel.
[257:01.01]So I kind of want to say maybe like somewhere around 800,000 total.
[257:04.53]850,000 maybe.
[257:06.05]So we're getting close to trumping original Jerma985.
[257:10.86]I wonder if it'll happen.
[257:18.60]That's crazy though.
[257:21.04]And a ton of those people are new.
[257:23.83]I think there was like 90, 80 or 90,000 new followers in the last two weeks.
[257:28.65]So if you just got, this is your first stream ever after watching the Dollhouse, maybe you saw the BTS stuff.
[257:35.66]I don't know, we'll see.
[257:36.88]Maybe you were gauging if you were going to continue to watch from this stream.
[257:41.10]Hopefully I made a good impression.
[257:43.68]If not, then I'm sorry.
[257:49.19]Welcome the new Jermamites.
[257:55.12]But thanks again.
[257:55.74]We'll see you this weekend, everybody.
[258:01.36]Much love to you, as always.
[258:04.20]No more Heroes 3.
[258:05.66]I have to figure out what I want to use for a control scheme.
[258:09.46]Probably the Joy-Cons, right?
[258:18.48]Have a great remainder of your evening.
[258:20.08]See you this weekend.
[258:21.38]Good night.
[258:21.86]Goodbye.
[258:23.44]And as always, thanks for watching.
[258:25.66]Take care of yourselves, and good night.
[259:26.34]I'm sorry, hold on.
[259:27.26]I'm going to switch to the view of the game because it's really kind of ominous and fucked up.
[259:31.82]It's like this dude hasn't gotten out of the car.
[259:35.86]He's still lying here.
[259:37.23]It's like, dude, call somebody, man.
[259:42.76]It's been like six hours.
[259:49.83]Why am I still sitting in here?
[259:51.11]Like, I can... I'm just staring at the... Alright.
[259:56.20]I'll see you guys this weekend.
[259:58.08]Goodbye.
