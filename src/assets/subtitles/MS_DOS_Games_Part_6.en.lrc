[07:17.79]Wow, what a fucked up world we live in.
[07:20.49]In whatever time frame this is.
[07:28.17]New York, Baltimore.
[07:30.07]Chicago?

[10:40.13]Goodbye.
[10:42.07]That's the B.F. Bugleberry mask.
[10:49.63]Agree.
[10:50.31]NYPD?
[10:55.20]Who are you?
[10:55.66]Get out of here at once.
[10:57.30]Why is the NYPD in an old-timey western sheriff's uniform?
[11:04.76]What?
[11:05.68]I don't understand.
[11:09.64]I think I just want to call people.
[11:13.84]Let's call Wall Street Finance.
[11:18.53]Wall Street Finance, may I help you?
[11:20.92]Agree.
[11:21.28]I need a loan.
[11:23.00]I want to invest some money.

[12:14.95]BMART.
[12:20.31]B mark, how may I help you?
[12:21.85]What?
[12:22.95]Why do they all have so much money behind them?
[12:27.09]Okay, other.
[12:29.17]Reservoir frogs?
[12:35.53]Holy shit!
[12:40.70]Hey, you lousy little pizza maker, where's the fire?
[12:45.81]Looking for a job on the side.
[12:47.01]Pick up a suitcase full of pirated films in the hotel tower in Union City on March 4th at 10.30 and bring it to the Hotel Lowe's Society in Manhattan on March 5th.
[12:56.61]Um, okay.
[12:58.21]If you're successful, you'll get $1,638.
[13:00.63]The risk is 9% interest.

[13:04.23]We expect you to carry out the orders to the letter and with absolute discretion.
[13:08.79]Okay.

[13:18.68]I'm just like, welcome to our little joke shop.
[13:21.44]We have something for everybody.
[13:26.18]Do you have ice cream?
[13:27.10]We just imported some delicious ice cream.
[13:28.76]What's your favorite?
[13:30.89]Lemon.
[13:32.29]One scoop is $11,000.
[13:33.29]Okay.
[13:34.77]How many scoops do you want?
[13:36.79]20.
[13:39.49]Okay.
[13:39.89]Well, I can't afford ice cream.
[13:47.42]Hey there, you lousy pizza maker.
[13:49.06]Uh, I'm looking for a job.
[13:50.96]You've already got one.
[13:51.94]I need money now.
[13:53.98]Before you can hit the big time, we need to get to know you better.
[13:55.90]You have some... You have to make a name for yourself.
[13:58.53]Alright, what do I have to do?
[14:00.79]Alright, hey.
[14:01.77]I got a... NYPD, I got something for you.
[14:05.49]Who are you?
[14:05.89]Get out of... Never mind.
[14:08.77]Okay, I have to deliver the... I don't even remember the street.
[14:30.48]I'm done.
[14:31.24]This one's done.
[14:35.92]We're gonna go with another one called Museum Madness.
[14:42.88]This one looks very interesting.
[14:44.22]I can turn this up a little bit, I think.
[14:57.81]Science and History Learning Mystery.
[15:01.22]Museum Madness.
[15:02.96]Wait, let me... I can bring it up a little bit.
[15:07.18]Okay, that's fine.
[15:09.40]I just wanted to turn it up a little.
[15:11.96]This is my room.
[15:21.92]It's very detailed.
[15:22.80]The National Museum database usually has tons of great stuff.
[15:26.16]That dinosaur puzzle I downloaded last month was excellent, but there isn't anything new since then.
[15:33.31]I think I'll quit info-serving and sign off for tonight.
[15:36.23]I sure miss talking to Mick, the museum information computer kiosk.
[15:40.35]That robot knows everything about the museum.
[15:43.20]Too bad he's offline.
[15:44.30]Until the museum computers are fixed.
[15:51.92]Interactive System Service National Museum, please wait.
[15:59.59]Now this would terrify me as an eight-year-old.
[16:02.82]Oh cool, it's Mick!
[16:03.68]Uh...
[16:26.15]I was offline undergoing reprogramming, but I have returned because I need your help.
[16:31.91]The entire National Museum is in danger.
[16:34.45]You must help me save it before its secrets are lost forever.
[16:37.92]You know I am responsible for maintaining the museum database.
[16:41.32]The database has been corrupted and the museum exhibits are out of control.
[16:48.79]And only this eight-year-old boy can do it, and not the police or the FBI or, like, CIA or anything.
[16:54.71]You.
[16:56.34]This is some sort of new online game, right?
[16:58.24]How can the museum be in danger?
[16:59.53]I know you're the guardian of the museum's database, but this is a little extreme, don't you think?
[17:07.41]This is no game.
[17:08.19]A strange force has taken over the museum since it closed a month ago to undergo conversion to total computer control.
[17:14.02]The exhibits have come to life.
[17:15.86]They're acting very peculiar.
[17:18.10]I suspect that a virus has invaded the system and corrupted the main control program.
[17:22.42]You must come to the museum at once and help me track down the virus.
[17:25.74]Don't go.
[17:31.04]I don't know about this.
[18:00.07]But Mick has been programmed to always act in the best interest of the museum.
[18:03.85]He's always given me good information and helped me solve problems using my museum database, yeah.
[18:09.43]If he says I'm the only one who can help, then I guess I have to believe him.
[18:12.69]Besides, he's a good friend and he needs my help.
[18:17.42]Oh my god.
[18:19.22]Adam Sandler made a movie about this like 10 years ago already.
[18:21.18]I mean, no.
[18:21.42]Ben... Not... Ben Stiller.
[18:48.01]Robots?
[18:48.57]Dinosaurs?
[18:49.27]The Wright brothers?
[18:50.03]I guess I have to do something.
[18:52.43]I know I can trust Mick because he is programmed to always tell the truth.
[18:55.89]What about you?
[18:56.67]You sound pretty programmed too.
[18:58.23]To say the same like five words.
[19:00.33]I better get down to the museum and check this out.
[19:07.82]That was just to get the title card.
[19:19.91]Guys, is Mick programmed to always tell the truth?
[19:22.97]I'm not sure.
[19:24.05]I thought maybe, possible.
[19:27.87]They always do the pre-credits thing back here.
[19:32.66]Is this Pokémon?
[19:33.38]It has the same outfit.
[19:36.84]Okay, I'm here.
[19:37.54]I'm glad I waited until morning.
[19:38.74]This place could be very creepy at night.
[19:46.78]It's the same image, but they just put a hat on him and put like a t-shirt here with a good backpack Boy, I'm gonna get grounded now.
[19:55.79]How do I get inside?
[19:56.52]Nick wasn't much help.
[19:57.34]I guess I'll have to figure it out for myself.
[19:58.84]Oh
[20:10.56]You made it up the stairs.
[20:11.42]Good for you.
[20:12.60]I wonder if anyone's around.
[20:13.50]Maybe I should take a closer look.
[20:15.98]I know the museum is closed for repairs.
[20:17.32]Maybe someone left a door open or something.
[20:24.52]What happened?
[20:25.42]Am I blacking out?
[20:27.24]Welcome to National Museum Hours.
[20:30.00]Monday to Saturday, 10 to 6.
[20:31.46]Sunday, 12 to 4.
[20:33.76]The museum is closed for repairs.
[20:35.20]Authorized personnel may enter through the side door.
[20:50.24]I can't read this.
[20:53.08]Harney's an electric supply.
[20:54.62]If it's electric, we can fix it.
[20:56.14]Dear Hari, I've had to have it early.
[21:00.46]If you need to get... In... Ingered?
[21:07.66]Age the combination lock on the guide door.
[21:11.50]You know the combination, but if you forgot, just look it up.
[21:14.41]Once you are inside, follow the game radar to the entrance hall.
[21:19.51]See you tomorrow.
[21:24.59]If you forget, just look up.
[21:25.49]Once you are inside, follow the same order to the... I don't know what this says.
[21:35.36]Oh, no, okay, if I go all the way, if I have to go all the way back here.
[21:38.20]I can read this.
[21:40.65]Pull back in your chair and go all the way back.
[21:44.45]I had to leave early.
[21:45.53]If you need to get inside, use the combination lock on the side door.
[21:50.05]You know the combination, but if you forget, just look up.
[21:52.56]Once you are inside, follow the same order to the entrance hall.
[21:55.84]See you tomorrow.
[21:56.52]The game order, whatever.
[21:59.71]Alright, let's go.
[22:01.61]Smash the fucking window.
[22:02.87]Alright, side door.
[22:04.75]I'm assuming it's this way.
[22:11.55]I feel like this is not possible to screw this up.
[22:20.95]This place is spooky.
[22:21.81]I hope I don't bump into anything.
[22:23.03]Alright, look up.
[22:26.99]Do I have, like... What the hell was that?
[22:29.27]Do I have, like, weapons?
[22:34.99]Who gave this kid a knife?
[22:37.29]Um... Pen.
[22:37.75]No, I want to, like, look up.
[22:42.58]If you forget it, just look up!
[22:44.44]Oh.
[22:44.70]Pfft.
[23:01.53]What kind of password is this?
[23:06.81]I know I've seen these symbols somewhere before.
[23:08.49]Maybe I should look around outside to jog my memory.
[23:13.95]Why would you need to shine the flashlight on this?
[23:16.09]Uh, was it outside?
[23:23.96]I had to look up.
[23:26.34]I can't look up.
[23:41.09]This is the password to the door.
[23:46.23]This is the equivalent of me, like, pasting my stream key on my house.
[23:50.88]Okay, uh, American flag, globe.
[23:53.00]Alright, America, globe, tree, ship, computer.
[23:59.71]American flag, all of the world, flag, world, tree, ship, computer.

[28:32.92]Hammer.
[28:33.98]Shield.
[28:34.86]Just screenshot this.
[28:36.46]Somebody got one.
[28:39.12]What's this next key for?
[28:40.38]Three?
[28:49.17]I think somebody made this just to fuck with this kid.
[28:52.35]You know what I mean?
[29:00.00]These walls are cardboard.
[29:00.90]This is not even a real place.
[29:17.84]Where is three?
[29:25.96]No, that's four.
[29:30.01]Right?
[29:32.21]No, left.
[29:35.65]Which one is this one?
[29:36.23]Is this three?
[29:37.67]Got it.
[29:40.56]Let's hope it's not boxes with symbols.
[29:44.62]It is.
[29:44.92]Seahorse.
[29:45.66]Let's just screenshot it.
[29:47.52]Ready?
[29:47.66]Take it.
[29:48.16]Good.
[29:48.34]Did somebody get it?
[29:49.18]Good.
[29:49.34]Now I gotta go find four again.
[30:10.70]there's five there's a five I don't even come hold on five is across from two this is two this is one five is across from one what do I have four that's three the box is one was two I mean one
[30:53.39]Here comes five.
[30:54.09]Five is across from three.
[30:59.61]Just make a map.
[31:00.69]Do you think I have paper and crayons in front of me?
[31:04.65]I'm at my desk.
[31:06.41]Screenshot this.
[31:16.24]Alright, five was across from three.
[31:19.39]Down here?
[31:19.77]This is the workshop.
[31:24.33]Alright, alright, turn around.
[31:25.99]It's directly in front of me.
[31:27.79]No, it's not.
[31:28.45]It's not directly in front of me, because that's the workshop.
[31:32.88]Wait, stop, stop, stop!
[31:35.68]Alright, I think that's it.
[31:39.05]I need to find... No, I think it's over here.
[32:06.18]That's where 5 is supposed to be.
[32:07.62]This is... This is like the Redler is behind this.
[32:10.56]I told you, they just fuck with me.
[32:16.63]It's across from there.
[32:38.10]It's not it, that's the exit.
[32:40.86]Shit.
[32:43.02]Okay, does anybody have any idea from here?
[32:45.78]Where to get- how to get to five?
[32:48.34]I think I've tried every option.
[32:53.53]That's- this le- There is no five.
[32:58.47]There has to be.
[33:04.35]This is... Two and four.
[33:08.40]Okay, that's two and four.
[33:09.66]But I don't even know what direction I'm turning.
[33:13.34]Um, over here.
[33:32.99]Help.
[33:34.33]Help me, Mick.
[33:35.39]It's not that one.
[33:36.53]It's not the one when I turn around.
[33:38.35]That's the exit.
[33:39.88]But I'm not even facing the right way.
[33:41.36]Like, you understand?
[33:41.84]Like, this is all fucked up.
[33:45.64]That's not it.
[33:46.44]This is the exit.
[33:50.94]This, okay, over here is two and four.
[33:53.38]This is a circle.
[33:58.54]Alright.
[33:59.40]Hold on a minute.
[34:01.43]No, stop!
[34:02.61]Don't take, don't comb your hair!
[34:05.49]Wasn't it right here?
[34:41.46]There's another... I don't even think there's another door.
[34:44.57]What's this other door?
[34:46.81]Card to the museum door.
[34:51.49]Got it.
[34:51.83]Let's go.
[34:52.17]Let's go.
[34:52.51]Get fucking excited.
[34:53.93]I am pumped right now.
[35:23.28]Oh, there he is!
[35:23.88]I. O. Error.
[35:25.36]What do you mean, I. O. Error?
[35:26.52]You got me all the way down here to tell me you have an I. O. Error?
[35:47.48]Take two aspirin and get over it.
[35:48.80]I thought you needed my help.
[35:51.50]Passive.
[35:51.94]Aggressive.
[35:54.18]No, that's just straight up aggressive.
[35:57.48]Wait, what did he say?
[36:02.88]Maybe he's trying to tell me something.
[36:04.02]That's the message I get from my computer when I haven't put the disk in the drive.
[36:14.08]What kept you?
[36:14.86]I've been waiting for you to arrive.
[36:17.00]My power is fading fast.
[36:18.78]You must act quickly.
[36:19.84]I need a new bat.
[36:23.84]Well, why didn't you tell me to come in through the skylight instead of through the maze?
[36:29.25]Keep your silicon shirt on.
[36:30.81]You don't give me much help.
[36:32.71]Hey, what's going on?
[36:33.57]You need bats?
[36:34.33]I need new bat.
[36:41.14]You need a bat?
[36:41.92]What, batter up?
[36:42.77]Bats in your belfry?
[36:44.07]Batman?
[36:44.69]I guess I should look for something batty.
[36:46.45]This better be worth it.
[36:48.33]I'm missing the next episode of America's Most Unwanted.
[36:50.75]Hey, well, let's be fair.
[36:52.51]This kid is, like, ten.
[37:05.56]Museum tour on tape.
[37:06.70]Batteries included.
[37:09.49]Alright, well let's... Let's open it up.
[37:15.05]The kit's pretty handy.
[37:17.43]Alright, it is batteries.
[37:20.27]He just jabs it with the knife!
[37:36.81]Only one of them had batteries?
[37:38.01]Yeah.
[37:39.89]Here, take some soda.
[37:40.49]I'm working on it!
[37:42.21]Why did it get so mean? ...
[38:07.43]I have reprocessed the information on the disk.
[38:09.67]The virus caused large gaps in my memory chips, but I was able to reconstruct some of the missing data from the program I modemmed to you.
[38:20.32]I have modified the disk and put a new label on it.
[38:22.36]You can use the disk to save a record of your progress through the museum.
[38:26.61]Until all of the gaps are filled in, we cannot discover the source of the virus that has infected the museum computers.
[38:33.22]I'm not sure anything is ever normal around here, but that sounds like fun.
[38:36.20]How do we get started?
[38:50.22]First, there are a few things you should know.
[38:51.66]The exhibits are now fully automated.
[38:53.38]Read the holographic information displays that appear as you enter each exhibit.
[38:57.10]You can access more information by activating the holo displays in each exhibit room.
[39:02.27]They are on the left.
[39:04.63]Cool.
[39:05.33]That way I'll know what's going on, I think.
[39:08.25]Be careful.
[39:08.77]All exhibit computer systems have been corrupted, including the cybernetic replicas.
[39:12.94]The SciReps are robots that look like people from history.
[39:16.34]You must interact with them to fix the exhibits.
[39:19.97]Then I have to talk to the robots that look like people from history books.
[39:22.83]Yes, that is what was just said.
[39:25.47]Excellent.
[39:25.93]Will you be there to help me?
[39:28.59]I will accompany you to each exhibit.
[39:30.17]When we arrive, I will link myself to the main computer and try to calculate what must be done to restore the exhibit.
[39:36.74]I will provide you with data for each room, but my processing power is limited and I need batteries and there are gaps in the database due to the effects of the virus and the thing that you put in.
[39:44.95]Okay, got it.
[39:45.51]We go to each exhibit, I check out the information displays, then I check with you to see what's happening after that.
[39:49.61]I talk to any sci-reps that are hanging out, and then I fix what's wrong with the exhibit.
[39:53.82]If I get stuck, you can give me some help, unless that part of your brain has been fried.
[39:57.14]No sweat, let's get started.
[39:57.98]How do I get to the first exhibit?
[39:59.82]Oh, here's the map on the wall that will unlock the exhibits.
[40:01.54]When we arrive, consult me again to learn what you must do.
[40:03.62]Remember, you must restore all of the exhibits before we can find the source of the virus.
[40:07.08]Oh my god, let's go.
[40:08.10]I actually don't remember where to go.
[40:26.71]What is this?
[40:27.49]No!
[40:29.17]This is a mess.
[40:29.69]It looks more like spaghetti than a map.
[40:32.31]How do you see spaghetti here?
[40:36.68]I think this kid needs a coffee.
[40:39.32]The map has been scrambled by the same force that is affecting the museum.
[40:42.20]You must unscramble it before we can unlock the exhibits while we're gonna be here for a while.
[40:47.32]Try touching one square and then another to rearrange them until the map is fixed.
[40:51.31]I'm gonna shut down for a while to save my energy.
[40:53.53]You do it.
[41:00.54]Alright, we gotta... I gotta... I just yawned!
[41:12.28]Fuck!
[41:15.88]I need the thing that connects to this.
[41:21.40]On the other side here.
[41:22.06]I need the left side here.
[41:23.28]Where's the left side?
[41:32.26]Alright, I got that.
[41:33.00]That's good.
[41:33.50]I got this one over here.
[41:36.34]Alright, then that goes up.
[41:39.39]What are these, like, clouds or whatever they are?
[41:41.65]No.
[41:42.63]Where is it?
[41:43.35]Right there.
[41:47.11]That leads up to the green area, which is this one.
[41:49.81]And then that leads up to here.
[41:50.97]Huh.
[41:52.96]Now that's a good question.
[41:55.14]I'll ask it again.
[41:56.00]I didn't ask a question.
[42:01.28]There we go.
[42:04.50]Alright, this one comes over here.
[42:07.04]Let's get the middle correct.
[42:14.93]Everybody's ResidentSleeper-ing right now.
[42:22.33]We gotta give this one a chance.
[42:24.47]We do.
[42:25.79]I'm sorry, we have to give this one a chance.
[42:28.97]Where is the... Where the hell does this one go?
[42:33.15]Is it like a cap?
[42:36.25]No.
[42:37.38]No, shit!
[42:38.72]There it is.
[42:41.12]Okay, then we bring this one over here.
[42:43.74]That's wrong.
[42:48.16]Wrong.
[42:49.30]Correct.
[42:51.27]Okay, we need the... This one definitely goes over here.
[43:00.84]No, it doesn't.
[43:02.78]No, that one doesn't either.
[43:03.62]Uh, something went wrong here.
[43:20.37]I think this all goes up.
[43:26.63]The whole middle is fucked up.
[43:30.92]Wait.
[43:31.86]Hold on.
[43:32.18]Give me a moment.
[43:32.66]I just simply have to go like this.
[43:35.72]Okay.
[43:37.34]But this is... How is this wrong?
[43:42.46]I need this one down here.
[43:45.44]No.
[43:45.74]Where is it?
[43:46.50]It's like right here.
[43:47.44]There it is.
[43:49.14]I'm fixing it.
[43:49.69]Don't worry.
[43:49.97]I got it.
[43:51.29]Okay.
[43:56.97]Alright.
[43:57.27]I'm going.
[43:58.33]I'm going.
[44:08.88]Alright, now this one over here This one over here That one over here Bingo!
[44:27.03]I'm glad to see you finally finished the map Now we can proceed to the exhibits What do you mean finally?
[44:33.22]Something tells me I'm gonna be doing all the work
[44:37.09]We have no time for this idle chatter.
[44:38.71]I have analyzed the present state of the museum exhibits.
[44:40.95]We can proceed to any exhibit.
[44:42.95]They're all desperately in need of help.
[44:45.05]We should move quickly before my power runs out.
[44:48.32]Don't tempt me to slow down.
[44:49.50]What do we do now?
[44:50.78]What?
[44:53.68]Yes, the map will unlock the exhibits.
[44:55.34]Just touch a location on the map to unlock that exhibit hall.
[44:57.74]I will fill you in on the situation when we get there.
[45:00.94]We have to go to the dinosaur one.
[45:07.99]This is a lot.
[45:11.55]A hall of robots, computer tech, radio, energy, simple machines, boring.
[45:18.61]How big is the universe?
[45:19.54]Kind of good.
[45:20.40]Solar system, cool.
[45:21.30]Rockets and computers, alright.
[45:23.22]Air powered flight, the Wright brothers, cool.
[45:26.84]Uh, Salem Witch Trials, Ellis Island, nah.
[45:32.74]Hall of the Dinosaurs, I don't see any others.
[45:42.54]Dinosaurs were first discovered in the 1820s.
[45:53.98]In my brain, it was like... They're like birds.
[45:56.88]We, like, found them.
[45:58.70]They're still around.
[45:59.36]This is some computer lab.
[46:01.36]I don't know what they do here, but it sure looks important.
[46:03.04]Maybe it's some type of government work.
[46:04.18]Where are the dinosaurs?
[46:28.70]There's 150 years, many scientists excavate dinosaurs as fossils.
[46:33.94]You can make them into models.
[46:34.98]There's a computer program that ensembles the bones completely.
[46:42.42]The dinosaur reconstruction computer ensembles a dinosaur within a few minutes.
[46:48.96]This computer is on display here.
[46:50.10]Okay, you can make dinosaurs in a few minutes.
[46:55.66]Program to build this dinosaur had this dinosaur reconstruction program has been wrecked by the museum-wide computer virus.
[47:00.02]Say okay.
[47:01.33]Go fix it.
[47:01.77]The dinosaur skeletons it built are completely corrupted.
[47:03.79]You must rebuild the skeletons.
[47:05.05]You got it.
[47:08.57]This is a dinosaur bone assembly program.
[47:10.13]Why not try the controls and take this thing for a spin?
[47:16.61]This is supposed to be a triceratops.
[47:29.74]Okay, this is just auto.
[47:30.92]Alright, Triceratops.
[47:41.00]That one.
[47:47.37]Why is this changing?
[47:51.13]What's going on?
[47:51.67]Why is it changing?
[47:52.35]I thought it wanted me to make a Triceratops.
[48:04.35]Okay, I got it.
[48:10.62]There it is.
[48:12.72]What's wrong with the tail?
[48:26.78]That's it, right?
[48:30.40]Different neck?
[48:42.32]the legs that's but they're also wrong the legs aren't even touching the ground it's the front legs that's not correct
[49:24.08]This is correct, but... They didn't have a big tip.
[49:37.53]Wait, hold on.
[49:42.53]That looks close.
[49:46.52]Oh, fuck.
[49:47.20]Okay, we'll make the T-Rex.
[49:54.56]T-Rex head.
[49:55.40]There's T-Rex neck.
[49:56.28]Body.
[49:59.72]It's that one.
[50:02.09]Here's the little baby hands.
[50:25.42]This is making me laugh way too much.
[50:28.86]Okay.
[50:33.50]Help!
[50:35.52]T-Rex.
[50:38.85]So just the tail.
[50:39.43]That doesn't fit.
[50:52.55]This is correct.
[50:54.53]The legs, I think?
[51:02.54]Is that it?
[51:07.98]That looks... I mean, what does a T-Rex's tail look like?
[51:19.31]Doesn't look like that.
[51:22.87]It's kind of long, isn't it?
[51:25.43]I think it's this one.
[51:26.11]I think it's that one.
[51:36.87]Oh god dammit.
[51:37.67]I love how he's doing like the prayer hands.
[52:03.17]It doesn't look like anything go- there it is.
[52:05.87]That's not the T-Rex?
[52:09.71]That's not the T- That's not the T-Rex.
[52:21.14]I'm surprised.
[52:21.88]No, that was the- This is the T-Rex head!
[52:30.40]The tail...
[52:42.06]His head is too small.
[52:47.92]I got it.
[52:53.11]Whoa, that's a fucking big fatty.
[52:56.05]That's not, that is not what a T-Rex looks like.
[52:59.89]Bullshit.
[53:00.95]This is Slimer from Ghostbusters.
[53:04.53]That is not a T-Rex!
[53:06.36]That is a frog!
[53:07.80]Bo- I- I- That is absolute dog shit.
[53:10.70]I refuse to accept that one.
[53:12.00]I don't even know what that looks like.
[53:19.51]Stegosaurus, I can do this one.
[53:25.01]Fucking T-Rex, give me a break.
[53:45.62]It's going on here.
[53:53.97]It's a new dinosaur.
[53:57.07]Frank, I think you put it together wrong.
[53:58.33]No, I didn't.
[54:14.10]It's all this one.
[54:15.00]Tail, the tail is correct too.
[54:19.30]Got it.
[54:26.35]That... Why is it skin?
[54:31.93]Why is it flesh?
[54:32.88]This is not, it was scales, wasn't it?
[54:34.78]This wasn't part of his body.
[54:42.93]Weren't these different, like, armor plates?
[54:47.25]These were not just pieces of skin with fat in them.
[54:49.94]Like a camel.
[54:54.84]Iguanodon.
[54:55.54]I don't even know what that is.
[54:58.36]Triceratops.
[54:58.92]We're going for it again.
[54:59.52]What the fuck does a Triceratops even look like?
[55:10.63]I mean that, when I think of Triceratops, this is what I see in my head.
[55:17.77]Like that, just big, thick body.
[55:25.70]They're short, they're not tall.
[55:28.22]It is like this, but is the body bigger?
[55:34.51]No.
[55:41.28]They're not that short?
[55:43.52]The body is right.
[55:44.55]No, I know.
[55:45.17]That's what I'm saying.
[55:53.60]This looks correct.
[56:00.64]It's the neck.
[56:10.61]Taller and thicker.
[56:11.57]No, the net, that's correct.
[56:15.45]The legs need to be longer.
[56:16.46]No, this is a cat.
[56:19.96]That's not a Triceratops.
[56:27.31]It's definitely that one.
[56:40.44]You have both legs wrong.
[56:47.13]There's no way!
[56:47.95]It's a Dachshund!
[56:57.20]That's not a Triceratops.
[57:09.91]No, the body is, it's not the body.
[57:12.09]Look, the body just gives you the starting point.
[57:14.27]That's, this is the Triceratops body.
[57:19.64]Don't they have a low hanging neck?
[57:26.12]This is a goddamn Triceratops, this is it.
[57:31.81]It's, no, it's not these ones.
[57:39.17]I... I gotta look up what... I gotta see what a triceratops looks like.
[57:43.47]I need to look it up right now.
[57:46.29]The neck needs to be longer.
[57:47.13]No, it doesn't.
[57:53.12]Triceratops.
[57:55.00]What the fuck does a triceratops look like?
[57:59.61]Like this.
[58:00.07]I had it right.
[58:02.21]This is correct.
[58:03.55]The head needs to be up a little higher.
[58:05.51]Like right there.
[58:09.53]And then they had these fat asses, these legs, and then the tail is not that long!
[58:16.53]A Triceratops' tail is not this long!
[58:39.74]The legs are too- There's only like three legs.
[58:42.12]Look at this!
[58:43.28]It's- This is not it.
[58:56.29]There's no- It's not it.
[59:01.05]It's absolutely not these ones.
[59:07.07]It's not the neck.
[59:07.79]The neck is in the right spot.
[59:10.76]No, this is wrong!
[59:23.14]That's not a Triceratops' body!
[59:24.96]A Triceratops' body doesn't go up this high!
[59:44.58]We were all wrong.
[59:45.40]Yeah, everyone was screaming at me.
[59:46.86]You guys didn't even get it right either.
[59:48.34]I... I... Brachiosaurus?
[59:51.99]I don't... I don't know what that... I know Brontosaurus.
[60:05.17]It's the same thing.
[60:05.96]Okay.
[60:11.95]That's definitely correct.
[60:13.95]It's the hind legs.
[60:15.53]I think they're... They're like this, aren't they?
[60:22.01]Yeah, they're big, tall.
[60:23.13]They got kind of the big legs.
[60:24.69]What about the tail?
[60:31.03]How big are their arms?
[60:32.27]Aren't they like usually that long?
[60:33.37]They have the big tails, right?
[60:44.15]So what's missing here?
[60:45.25]The legs, maybe?
[60:47.81]Like that, maybe?
[60:49.03]No?
[60:54.75]Longer neck.
[61:08.26]Yeah, the head doesn't look right.
[61:09.44]No, the head is not correct.
[61:10.58]That's definitely not the right head.
[61:11.58]You're right.
[61:12.86]It's just one of these weird ones.
[61:17.54]It's like the weird crocodile one.
[61:28.69]No, it is that one.
[61:29.47]Okay.
[61:30.75]So let's go back to this.
[61:38.75]Alright, so now what is wrong here?
[61:43.51]I think the neck is not right.
[61:51.82]Long legs.
[61:58.56]I'm not sure it's this neck.
[61:59.94]You guys are telling me it's this.
[62:00.96]I don't think it is.
[62:07.66]This looks pretty right.
[62:24.41]Okay, that to me looks correct.
[62:26.30]There's only three options.
[62:31.58]Are they squished in together?
[62:32.76]They're not that long.
[62:42.46]No, it's definitely not what it has to be, right?
[62:49.03]The body?
[62:49.43]If I change the body, it's not gonna be, uh, Brontosaurus anymore.
[63:04.64]Change neck!
[63:05.56]Change neck!
[63:08.16]That doesn't look right!
[63:13.81]I tried that tail!
[63:24.91]Wrong forelimb.
[63:25.87]It's not the prayer hands.
[63:27.97]Is it the prayer hands?
[63:40.95]They walked on all fours.
[63:41.95]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[63:43.23]It's got to be like these two.
[63:45.76]It's either this one or this one.
[63:51.58]Is it the shorter ones or the bigger, the longer ones?
[63:58.82]So this is it.
[64:02.09]Neck and tail are wrong.
[64:03.83]We'll fight the 3,000 people that are screaming as loud as they can that I have the neck correct.
[64:11.51]short of tail now the neck I'm not is it oh my god I've just
[64:33.18]It was the fucking neck.
[64:34.06]I knew it.
[64:35.20]I knew it.
[64:35.70]I told you guys the neck was wrong.
[64:37.34]I told you the neck was wrong.
[64:39.06]And I was... Everybody yelled at me.
[64:40.44]They laughed at me.
[64:41.51]Said I was stupid.
[64:42.87]You're dumb.
[64:43.31]You're an idiot.
[64:44.95]The neck was fucking... I knew it.
[64:46.41]I was right.
[64:53.32]Long neck.
[64:54.12]Big neck.
[64:54.80]Long neck.
[65:05.60]Somebody is overfeeding these things.
[65:11.32]But, like, I don't... The image in my brain when I think of a brontosaurus is not this.
[65:24.11]This looks like the Loch Ness Monster picture that circled around.
[65:28.54]Like, this is a person's arm.
[65:30.16]A hand, arm, and this is their shoulder, and their head should be here.
[65:32.76]This is their other arm.
[65:39.23]Okay, Iguanodon.
[65:58.91]That posture.
[66:05.63]Got that one easily.
[66:13.13]This next one.
[66:15.25]Didn't even need to look.
[66:23.88]Alright, so this is the head down here for me.
[66:27.56]This is the tail.
[66:29.06]I feel like this is standing this way and its head is like slumped down, lying down.
[66:32.69]It's sleeping.
[66:33.35]That's how they sleep.
[66:39.87]I did it.
[66:43.82]That was tough, but I'm glad I boned up on paleontology before I came down here.
[66:47.76]I wonder if the dinosaur exhibits are in any better shape.
[66:50.12]Maybe I should take a look.
[66:50.92]Now that's what I call a tyrant lizard.
[67:01.07]Is this thing alive?
[67:16.74]Quick, stab it!
[67:19.60]Uh... Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[67:23.27]Don't care.
[67:23.71]That's a pug neck.
[67:32.39]That Iguanodon looks a little like my math teacher.
[67:34.44]I wonder if he can do three-place multiplication in his little brain.
[67:46.68]Didn't know the Brachiosaurus was so tall.
[67:48.85]I wonder what was kept in that bump on its head.
[67:59.34]This is one long dinosaur.
[68:00.72]I bet she would make a great water slide if you could get her to stand still.
[68:13.11]Those three horns look dangerous.
[68:14.31]I'll bet he could play fallback for any team he wanted.
[68:20.91]No, they don't do anything.
[68:27.54]The Stegosaurus was probably a nice guy, but I wouldn't want him to get mad and hit me with that spiked tail.
[68:32.92]This is fun, but I still have work to do if I'm going to get this whole museum put back together.
[68:37.12]These guys are a dino-mite.
[68:39.02]But I should hustle back to the main hall and see if anything else is falling apart.
[68:43.18]What was the point of me walking down here?
[68:46.26]Alright, that was fun.
[68:47.08]That was easy.
[68:56.82]Ocean life.
[68:57.98]All of animal habitats.
[68:59.26]All of ecology.
[69:00.94]The Earth's geology.
[69:02.42]Prehistoric people.
[69:03.28]The development of writing.
[69:05.12]Knight's heraldry and jousting.
[69:07.62]Galileo's telescope or industrial revolution.
[69:10.00]Solar system.
[69:12.54]How big is the universe?
[69:13.52]The solar system.
[69:14.50]Alright, everyone wants to do it.
[69:16.96]Sure.
[69:24.16]Nobody's going to read any of this.
[69:29.32]Look at all the stars.
[69:30.06]I love looking at that night sky.
[69:32.11]Makes me think about how large the universe is and how small we are.
[69:35.27]Also, it makes me think about a t-shirt that I could possibly purchase if I really cared about having one of those from the Nidoo Exclamation Point t-shirts.
[69:43.63]The sky looks peaceful enough, but I'm sure something must be wrong or we wouldn't be here.
[69:48.81]Warning!
[69:49.28]Computer analysis has determined that stars in Projection Dome do not match star Atlas settings.
[69:53.76]Uh-oh, there's the main computer's voice.
[69:56.34]It probably means something bad's about to happen.
[69:59.18]Warning!
[69:59.64]Warning!
[70:00.04]Program overload cannot resolve out-of-place star data.
[70:03.46]System shutdown sequence initiated.
[70:04.94]Star data will be purged from system in 60 minutes.
[70:08.82]Guess that means I have to find a way to put those stars back where they belong.
[70:11.68]I always wanted to save the world, but saving the universe is a little much.
[70:15.86]Maybe I should check with Mick.
[70:16.90]He usually has some good info.
[70:22.71]What, is this like an ion cannon?
[70:24.33]I don't understand.
[70:26.25]Is this like a death star?
[70:28.17]What do you mean, purge the stars?
[70:31.35]This is the planetarium projection room.
[70:32.93]The celestial projector shows the stars as they actually appear in the night sky.
[70:41.04]Okay.
[70:42.26]The projector's program has been corrupted by the virus and the five stars are out of place.
[70:46.72]Oh, and only five.
[70:47.72]I was going to say, there's only five?
[70:51.45]When the projection system tried to correct it in locations of these stars, it caused a program overload.
[70:56.75]All the data will be lost forever if the stars are not put back in their proper location.
[70:59.97]Use the information in the star Atlas to reprogram the projector and put the stars back where they belong.
[71:14.30]What the fuck do you want me to do?
[71:24.27]This looks like the sky in the planetarium, but something tells me that it's not quite the same.
[71:28.39]If I'm correct, I should be able to get some information about the stars from this screen.
[71:34.80]Maybe I can use the info to put the stars back where they belong.
[71:43.92]What?
[71:46.10]Spectrum.
[71:46.98]Blue, blue, green... Frog.
[71:50.19]Uh... Light green, orange, pink, red.
[71:57.15]What does that tell me though?
[71:58.17]I don't get it.
[71:58.53]8-26-1991.
[71:59.19]Okay, it was 8-26-1991.
[72:20.58]New game.
[72:21.04]40, 260.
[72:21.36]This is cool, though.
[72:24.88]I don't hate this.
[72:53.31]a fun game I don't get what this stuff is for though radio wave infrared spectrum like how do I I mean that's correct day and everything project it's right there
[73:24.87]Put your birthday in.
[73:25.85]It's time for you guys to pick where we go.
[73:36.96]This is where we were.
[73:37.96]I believe at the end of... No, I think we were further down.
[73:45.64]No, we were right here.
[73:47.67]Right, like, here.
[73:55.51]Oh, no.
[73:55.81]We did the Bard's Tale, right?
[73:57.17]Yeah, I remember the Bard's Tale.
[73:58.57]Pizza Tycoon's right there.
[73:59.53]Yeah, this looks right.
[74:00.21]Alright.
[74:06.17]In just a moment, you'll be able to click on the screen.
[74:09.95]And please do.
[74:12.39]Right now.
[74:18.82]Wayne's world wizardry proving grounds of the mad uh it seems to be unanimous Wayne's world this is going to be just a side scroller
[74:42.21]you have a slingshot and you have to you're in like a living room and jumping over stuff and it's like a guitar power up that you pick up for points I already know what this game is but we're gonna play like every game back in like the 80s and 90s that was based on a TV show or a movie was always a side scroller
[75:16.47]Let's see how that is.
[75:26.77]Capstone?
[75:30.23]Pinnacle of entertainment software!
[75:38.53]Blaze world!
[75:38.87]Blaze world!
[75:39.31]Party time!
[75:40.81]At the rim!
[75:46.17]I don't think I remember this.
[75:55.47]Watch that be it.
[75:58.75]Next disk.
[76:00.97]We're not mental or anything so don't be afraid.
[76:07.16]My name is Wayne and this is Garth.
[76:14.41]That's it?
[76:14.79]That's all?
[76:15.13]They just do one line?
[76:16.07]Oh, it's just pulled audio.
[76:22.56]Ah, we're you, the viewer.
[76:25.08]Can express your opinions about babes.
[76:27.14]Oh, okay.
[76:28.70]Yeah!
[76:29.74]Or perhaps videos.
[76:32.84]Or even Garth's... Yeah, or whatever you want to talk about.
[76:36.87]Okay.
[76:38.91]First caller.
[76:39.51]Hi, my name is C.L.
[76:41.59]Elvis.
[76:42.01]I'm the local community access program reviewer.
[76:45.15]What do you think of our show?
[76:46.03]Well, that's why I called.
[76:48.22]First of all, I think that the Wayne's World logo should rotate counterclockwise instead of clockwise.
[76:53.94]That would double our ratings.
[76:55.74]Not.
[76:59.10]Also, I think that Garth should be left-handed.
[77:02.44]It will add a certain symmetry.
[77:11.01]Finally, I think that those interruption things that happen during the show should be taken out.
[77:15.34]They distract the viewer.
[77:17.98]You mean the commercials.
[77:20.80]Do you know anything about television?
[77:24.22]How did you become a reviewer?
[77:25.68]I've gone in and out.
[77:26.48]I always wanted to be on TV.
[77:29.28]But when I dropped out of high school, I couldn't get any jobs except this one.
[77:33.46]Do you guys need a third person?
[77:35.92]We could be C, L, Wayne, and Garth.
[77:40.04]Good job.
[77:40.46]Yo, dudes, I just saw the most amazing thing.
[77:46.65]A flashing red light in the sky.
[77:48.77]Out by the radio station.
[77:51.45]I think it was a UFO.
[78:01.73]Yeah, well, I forgot to tell you.
[78:03.99]This UFO flew right up next to my car, and I could see the little aliens looking out of the window at me.
[78:09.52]What did they look like?
[78:12.38]They were green, and they had four eyes.
[78:14.60]Well, the aliens on the ship that I saw had eight eyes and antenna, and they glowed in the dark.
[78:20.00]Get the math!
[78:21.71]Oh, well, I forgot to tell you.
[78:23.65]Uh, they beamed me onto their spaceship.
[78:25.57]Excellent.
[78:28.08]They took me to their leader.
[78:30.56]She was this awesome babe alien who looked like Madonna.
[78:35.20]Oh.
[78:35.86]Oh, she's so cool.
[78:37.86]Here it comes.
[78:38.28]Ready?
[78:39.72]No.
[78:42.79]Good call, girl.
[78:46.59]Next caller.
[78:47.23]Can I do something?
[78:53.86]I think that you and your long-haired hippie friend are in front of the decent, hard-working, normally upstanding citizens of this community.
[79:05.34]We're ashamed.
[79:06.10]We're not worthy.
[79:09.86]This is just the soundboard of the movie.
[79:16.32]You only bought this to hear these lines because there's no such thing as media that could play out of your computer.
[79:25.46]When you, this was like, oh, I remember when he said that when I went to the movie theater, because that's the only time I've ever been able to hear him say that.
[79:35.92]This was a huge deal.
[79:36.80]A sphincter says what?
[79:40.28]There's no, I can't skip, there's no such thing as skipping.
[79:49.63]Yeah, we're on this Saturday Night Live, but you had to wait till Saturday to hear him go, we're not worthy.
[79:57.12]Who are they even talking about?
[80:01.40]Remember that time Garth's mom- What is going on?
[80:09.34]Why is this happening?
[80:22.39]Why is this happening?
[80:24.81]I cannot go on.
[80:31.88]Excuse me?
[80:41.74]How do I do anything else?
[80:43.53]We need to see what happens.
[80:46.13]Why did I vote for this?
[80:46.91]This was not a streamer's choice.
[80:48.03]This was a chat's choice.
[80:49.83]Wayne!
[80:51.49]Party on, girl.
[80:52.47]Party on, Wayne.
[80:59.99]Here we go.
[81:01.17]This is Here It Comes.
[81:06.72]We're going to have the side-scrolling action platformer.
[81:10.50]We're going to leave the living room.
[81:11.64]We have to get, like, burritos and pick up the guitars, cymbals, and records, and I throw records out of my hand.
[81:19.13]Extreme close-up!
[81:20.83]Whoa!
[81:30.70]That's not the end.
[81:41.15]Oh, it is way, way worse than I thought.
[81:43.51]How do I get out of this?
[81:49.55]Music off.
[81:50.33]On.
[81:50.49]Music on.
[81:51.29]That's fine.
[81:52.09]Exit?
[81:53.87]This is serious.
[81:54.39]What should we do?
[81:58.09]Let's paper the mayor's yard.
[82:00.69]Let's write to our co- Let's go get a pizza!
[82:03.67]Pizza, pizza, I've got a great idea!
[82:05.31]Let's have a pizzathon.
[82:11.91]Pizzathon!
[82:12.83]Yeah!
[82:13.19]Let's have like a pizzathon.
[82:17.89]Yeah!
[82:21.07]Why are they just standing here like this?
[82:26.55]This is freaking me out.
[82:27.45]Uh, Wayne, how do you make a pizza?
[82:29.13]Oh, you dial up the pizza parlor.
[82:30.77]You say, hey, I'd like a pepperoni pizza.
[82:33.56]I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[82:35.12]Alright, um...
[82:53.55]I'd like to watch magicians.
[82:55.03]This is just random thoughts.
[83:00.37]We'll need a place to make all this pizza.
[83:07.42]We'll need some advertising.
[83:09.98]Are they gonna open up a pizza restaurant?
[83:11.48]A lot of pizza ingredients.
[83:21.91]We'll need a lot more video equipment than we have.
[83:25.33]We'll need to have a pepperoni farm.
[83:33.51]We'll need phone volunteers and delivery people.
[83:40.03]We'll need an electronic totals board.
[83:45.12]They're just replacing them.
[83:46.28]We'll have to have a lot of dough.
[83:47.46]We'll have to have a really cool music act.
[83:50.94]That's a good idea, Garth!
[83:52.28]Ah!
[83:53.00]How about a comedian?
[83:55.42]I'm stuck forever.
[84:17.27]I think I might be actually soft lucked from the pizza one.
[84:48.76]Scroll up.
[84:49.80]No, we're not scrolling up.
[84:54.28]We already did.
[84:54.84]We're already here.
[84:55.38]Remember Mickey's ABCs?
[85:01.93]Tubin?
[85:17.93]Reader Rabbit?
[85:18.55]I kind of just want to play this one.
[85:19.61]I'm going to streamer's choice this one.
[85:38.10]The Learning Company presents Reader Rabbit.
[85:41.83]Press enter to go on.
[85:45.53]That's a lot of info.
[85:45.99]Press a number to play a game.
[85:47.11]Sorter, Labeler, Word Train, Matchup Game.
[85:51.80]Let's do, uh, Labeler.

[85:55.46]Press 2.
[85:56.26]Bug, Pig, Dog.
[85:57.26]Okay.
[85:59.08]I just have to label what they are?
[86:03.60]That's Bug.
[86:10.69]Bug, Pig.
[86:12.11]Wait, I already... They just gave me the answers.
[86:26.54]Okay, I have to do this in less than 10 seconds.
[86:28.18]Ready?
[86:29.70]Start counting.
[86:31.54]No.
[86:31.86]10.
[86:34.94]I can't believe I'm fucking playing this right now on stream.
[86:49.10]Seriously.
[86:50.94]Van, gas, bus.
[86:53.22]And start counting.
[86:53.94]Ready, go.
[87:16.62]Van, gas, bus.
[87:17.52]Again.
[87:18.20]I'll get it quicker this time.
[87:21.22]Ready, start counting.
[87:22.16]And when the first letter lands, start counting.
[87:32.75]Nope!
[87:32.95]Holy shit, I did that fast.
[87:34.13]Okay, I'm done.
[87:59.15]I have to do this one.
