[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.80]Good afternoon.
[00:02.50]How are you doing?
[00:06.60]This moment's going down in history.
[00:10.70]This is the second time I've ever sworn off a Mario Maker game in one day.
[00:19.44]I got a lot of heat for this one.
[00:21.56]People say in Jerma, you said, Mario Maker, you said you've never played ever again, and you hated it.
[00:27.16]I didn't hate the game.
[00:28.62]But, I mean, I did say that, but this is Mario, this is a different game.
[00:31.66]This is Mario Maker 2.
[00:34.14]Not the same game.
[00:34.78]Yeah, okay, so I swore, this is a different video game.
[00:44.92]It's the same game.
[00:47.56]No, it's not.
[00:49.97]They added Super Mario 3D World levels!
[00:52.21]Sorry, that's how much research you've done!
[00:58.71]Wow!
[00:59.75]What?
[01:00.07]Really?
[01:00.39]I was under the assumption that everybody loved Super Mario!
[01:09.16]What happened?
[01:09.58]What happened?
[01:10.12]Everybody likes Super Mario anymore?
[01:21.82]Alright, give me one second, I gotta-
[02:11.95]Alright.
[02:13.09]So we're gonna do this for a little while.
[02:14.17]And I don't know, if it's fun, we'll keep doing it.
[02:16.85]If not, then... I got no plan, man, you know?
[02:24.34]He came back.
[02:24.98]Yeah, of course I came back.
[02:30.14]So let's go... I mean, why not, right?
[02:33.19]Here it is.
[02:33.53]I've only got 335 seconds remaining.
[02:37.75]Oh wait, I have to do an audio test with you guys.
[02:39.99]Hold on.
[02:43.07]Let me just test the audio.
[02:44.75]Make sure this is synced up.
[02:48.10]Alright, ready?
[02:49.86]I'm gonna jump and I'm gonna grab the coin.
[02:51.58]Ready?
[02:51.82]Now.
[02:52.94]Got it.
[02:55.18]How we doing?
[02:55.94]Jump.
[02:57.10]Jump.
[02:57.72]Jump.
[02:58.20]Jump.
[02:59.00]Jump.
[03:01.26]Are we synced?
[03:09.21]I think that should be good.
[03:11.17]Should be is the right question.
[03:14.59]My voice is low.
[03:15.57]Hold on.
[03:17.67]I did do some messing around with my audio, so let me see if I fucked something up.
[03:22.93]Better?
[03:24.19]I think that's better.
[03:26.41]I don't think I... I was messing around with audio bits.
[03:30.93]I should be louder now.
[03:31.71]Alright, so.
[03:35.99]Anyways.
[03:37.82]I don't know anything about this.
[03:40.24]I didn't watch the Direct.
[03:44.53]They did a whole direct about, here comes Super Mario Maker 2!
[03:47.45]Get excited for it!
[03:49.53]I didn't watch it.
[03:51.37]All I know is that they just made another one.
[03:52.66]Is there anything I need to know?
[03:54.18]This is all fresh to me.
[03:58.20]Completely fresh.
[04:03.74]He doesn't know.
[04:06.16]Well, I opened this and I made an account.
[04:08.99]I ain't gonna make a level, by the way, guys.
[04:10.49]If you think you're gonna get that on this stream, you are out of your mind.
[04:14.13]So there's a campaign.
[04:15.17]Should I play the campaign?
[04:23.27]There is a campaign.
[04:24.15]Well, it wasn't easy, but we finally finished the castle.
[04:47.69]Yeah, this is messing with my immersion.
[04:49.69]Mario's a plumber.
[04:50.47]He's not a construction worker.
[04:51.79]You couldn't have done it without you, Chief Princess Peach.
[04:55.80]You'll be thrilled.
[05:01.60]Mario's not a construction worker.
[05:03.28]He's not a carpenter.
[05:03.98]He's a plumber.
[05:06.18]They changed that.
[05:08.13]Yes, he was a carpenter back in the original, but this is 2019 Mario.
[05:16.53]Who left the Resort Reset Rocket lying around?
[05:19.17]It wasn't me, Chief.
[05:20.87]Pretty sure it was... The dog!
[05:24.65]Is it a dog?
[05:25.23]New character.
[05:28.87]Oh, it's... It's the dog!
[05:34.05]I can't make a name up right now.
[05:35.77]It's Marshmallow!
[05:40.79]No, that's like a... It's a dude that makes EDM music.
[05:52.95]Three, two, one, get off the button!
[06:05.01]What the hell is going on?
[06:09.67]Okay, see, this is why I'm a cat person.
[06:13.26]Alright, so... All that hard work just gone.
[06:19.42]See, this is why I'm a cat person.
[06:22.15]I can't believe it.
[06:23.03]Princess Peach's castle.
[06:25.39]We have to rebuild it.
[06:27.43]But we've used up our entire budget.
[06:29.31]This is really bad.
[06:33.37]Oh, too bad you can't say, like, your problem.
[06:37.60]Leave it to me.
[06:38.66]I'll handle it.
[06:41.88]I guess I'll handle it.
[06:44.18]Of course, why did I think of that?
[06:45.44]You can collect enough coins for us to rebuild.
[06:49.36]With help?
[06:50.66]We can make an even bigger and better castle than before.
[06:53.53]Go see if the Taskmaster can scrape together a few jobs for you.
[06:57.75]We need funding.
[07:01.25]Mario secures funding.
[07:03.67]Okay.
[07:05.53]I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but I kind of sort of overheard your entire conversation with the Chief.
[07:11.34]Lucky for us, I got a line on some jobs from around the world.
[07:15.92]If you complete enough jobs, we should be able to make enough coins to rebuild the whole castle.
[07:21.43]I gotta say, knowing you're gonna single-handedly fund this entire construction effort really takes the pressure off me, you know?
[07:29.73]Okay, no time to waste.
[07:30.59]Check out this job from someone named Goomba Lover.
[07:36.10]Most of these clients don't use their real names.
[07:38.50]I don't ask too many questions.
[07:40.60]As long as they cough up the coins.
[07:45.82]Got like a- what- what- this is- okay.
[07:48.44]Never mind.
[07:49.46]This guy get off to this?
[07:51.38]Is that what's going on here?
[07:52.23]I don't understand.
[08:16.45]Alright, let's do it.
[08:21.34]Alright, I'm already big.
[08:23.76]Can I get the big guy?
[08:24.56]Yeah, I can.
[08:26.22]Oh, it's been so long since I've played Super Mario!
[08:35.40]What's- what- I've never seen that come.
[08:40.31]Jerma, I believe in you.
[08:41.53]What do you mean?
[08:43.75]This is probably the best song that they've ever made, either.
[08:46.07]Either.
[08:46.67]I mean, ever.
[08:47.13]So do I have to collect the coins, or... Do you just get the coins?
[08:55.16]That's a secret, hold on.
[08:56.92]No, wait!
[09:00.78]This is the panic button!
[09:01.82]Every time you get a star, you have to go panic mode.
[09:06.86]If I die on the first level, I'm gonna stop playing the game.
[09:09.74]Just make sure, I want you guys to be very aware of that.
[09:13.20]If I die on the first fucking Goomba lover level, I'm going to- okay, we're good.
[09:24.85]You can't die.
[09:26.35]Yes, you can.
[09:27.41]If I walk into the Goombas twice.
[09:32.15]Collected payment.
[09:37.61]Did they take this shit from Mario Odyssey?
[09:42.60]Where you have to get a currency and pay?
[09:44.10]Alright, so let's play the foundation.
[09:48.24]Do I have enough money?
[09:51.28]Did you get some coins?
[09:52.23]Yes, I do.
[09:52.81]Oh, you do?
[09:53.25]It does add to your balance.
[09:56.45]Mario Odyssey invented currency.
[09:59.45]No, but you had to pay the currency to make the ship better and fly.
[10:04.21]I have to pay the currency to build the castle back.
[10:08.14]Yeah, okay.
[10:11.92]Choose foundation to put in the work order.
[10:13.94]Do I get to make my own castle?
[10:16.78]You sure about that?
[10:18.39]No, I'm not sure.
[10:19.67]Just keep it leveled.
[10:22.01]Let's work out of a tent from now on.
[10:23.65]Do I have to tap the screen really fast?
[10:30.81]Construction has started on the foundation.
[10:35.53]We'll keep working while you're off making moolah.
[10:39.55]So get out there and do some more jobs.
[10:42.99]I got three new jobs for you.
[10:46.00]Alright.
[10:46.96]A word of advice from old Taskmaster Toad.
[10:50.10]You can run the same job as many times as you want.
[10:53.22]You won't get paid for it again.
[10:55.06]But you get coins that you pick up.
[10:58.98]Now, back to work.
[11:01.13]Some new jobs just came in.
[11:03.51]On-off switch research expedition.
[11:05.39]These are... I wouldn't need here.
[11:10.27]Alright, on-off switch.
[11:12.11]Might as well steal an order.
[11:14.88]Hmm, the on-off switch.
[11:16.70]No one really knows how it actually works.
[11:19.14]Wireless protocols.
[11:21.00]Ancient magic.
[11:21.70]Get to the end of this course and I'll reward you handsomely.
[11:23.58]Hmm, Dr. Gizmo.
[11:28.19]Good luck out there, Big Red.
[11:38.25]Yo, this is a new style!
[11:41.29]Hold on.
[11:41.85]On.
[11:43.07]Oh, that's how the on-off switch works, guys!
[11:45.57]Just in case you didn't know!
[11:53.85]One.
[11:54.47]Two.
[11:55.23]Three!
[11:55.59]Alright, I'm done playing.
[11:56.79]I'm gonna, like, stream myself eating a burrito.
[11:58.86]Like, I don't think I wanna do this anymore.
[12:03.42]Uh...
[12:11.17]That was quick.
[12:13.33]Trap him!
[12:19.14]Oh fuck, I can't die here, otherwise I have to fucking delete my account.
[12:31.74]You guys think that that's a joke?
[12:32.84]Okay, when I, when I'm done, when I'm, when I'm fucking done, and I mean done with Twitch, YouTube, don't matter, right?
[12:45.02]I'm gonna do that one day.
[12:46.06]I'm just gonna be like, you know what, yeah, if I die here, I'm deleting my account, and I'm gonna die, and I'm gonna delete my account, and you'll never see me again.
[12:59.95]Got him.
[13:00.45]Oh, I need those coins.
[13:06.54]It's too icy.
[13:07.32]That's not happening right now.
[13:12.96]Why does everybody think this is happening today?
[13:22.69]You guys are acting like I'm doing this in an hour.
[13:24.48]Hold on, wait.
[13:25.36]There's a secret down here, I think.
[13:27.70]There's a secret.
[13:29.86]Fuck, I can't get it.
[13:30.72]Super coin.
[13:32.86]How do I get down there?
[13:35.02]I'm gonna keep it off.
[13:49.38]Check this out.
[13:50.44]Now it's not blocked.
[13:51.64]Now it... Wait.
[13:54.09]Oops.
[13:54.39]It's alright.
[13:55.05]I... Now... Let's go!
[14:23.04]Wait.
[14:24.24]Can't go up?
[14:27.36]This is gonna be weird.
[14:28.20]Check this out.
[14:29.02]No, no, no, no.
[14:29.48]Stay in there.
[14:30.94]Can they both kill me?
[14:34.38]Will I get teleporter exited if I stand there?
[14:37.00]Let's test it.
[14:39.24]Nope.
[14:39.76]Got it.
[14:53.02]I'm gonna do that every single time.
[14:54.76]So you may as well leave now, if you don't want to hear that again.
[14:56.84]You're not gonna win enough for that to happen.
[15:13.15]So I asked this in the pre-stream chat.
[15:15.77]Did they get rid of the 100 Mario?
[15:19.92]thing is there still expert difficulty is it still regular just normal how did they do that I think and the two more I kind of like this um what's going on once we finish the foundation the real work begins this is kind of fun alright so we got hello 3d world
[15:46.48]I've planted all these cute trees in my garden.
[15:48.82]Would someone try reaching the goal by climbing the trees with Up?
[15:51.75]I haven't weeded the garden in a while, but if the piranha plants give you trouble, just stomp them into the dirt.
[15:55.91]Okay.
[15:59.65]You don't have to read this.
[16:00.67]It's Mario.
[16:03.47]Why wouldn't I read it?
[16:05.90]I'm just gonna skip it?
[16:10.10]Why wouldn't I read that?
[16:13.41]Can I just say, I am so in love with this... teaser of Diablo 3 image screenshot here.
[16:21.12]Some of you guys are gonna know what I'm talking about.
[16:24.62]Stomp him, right?
[16:26.30]How do you stomp?
[16:29.58]Like that.
[16:30.38]Oops.
[16:41.43]What the fuck am I on?
[16:45.33]Some of you got it.
[16:46.11]I don't need to explain everything.
[16:48.18]People get mad at me when I explain the reference.
[16:52.00]They go, we know, we know!
[16:53.48]And I go, what the fuck?
[16:56.38]Climb the tree.
[17:05.99]That's cool.
[17:07.45]Can I do the double, triple jump?
[17:15.00]So, I'm a casual fucking fan.
[17:17.62]Not even.
[17:18.18]I'm not even a fan.
[17:20.40]Some people would be probably mad at me knowing that this is the last Mario game that I actually opened and played was Mario Maker 1.
[17:28.96]On top of that, before that, you have to go back to Mario Galaxy 1.
[17:38.22]Am I a cat?
[17:43.04]Oh, the internet's gonna love this one!
[17:45.24]Can I do anything else with the cat?
[17:49.55]You just scratch.
[17:52.33]Wait a minute, how do I get that?
[17:55.01]Whatever.
[18:10.19]Hey, big bro, if you're having trouble with the course, use some assist parts!
[18:15.85]Oh shit, there he is!
[18:17.75]It's Luigi!
[18:19.37]He's showing up already!
[18:26.14]I can't wait till the next time I die and it goes, don't cry!
[18:32.80]Give the controller to your older brother!
[18:42.08]Don't worry, don't cry!
[18:43.40]Okay.
[18:48.84]I gotta attack that with the cat.
[18:50.62]I didn't know I could do that.
[18:58.73]I didn't know!
[18:59.81]When was this?
[19:00.31]Have they ever used this suit before?
[19:01.53]I needed you.
[19:07.31]No, wait, you can climb walls as the cat?
[19:11.21]What?!
[19:12.11]Wait, I need you.
[19:13.83]No, I want to jump!
[19:16.03]I want to jump his head!
[19:19.08]Hold on.
[19:20.96]You can sprint faster as the cat, too.
[19:23.82]I don't need any more.
[19:25.30]I don't need any more.
[19:38.34]He's not reading chat?
[19:39.24]Well, I can't... How am I gonna read chat?
[19:40.86]And play this incredibly, incredibly intense game?
[19:49.89]I can actually climb this, too.
[19:51.03]Oh, it has the cat curtains.
[19:52.95]I get it.
[19:53.39]That's cute.
[19:57.87]How do I get these?
[19:58.53]No, no!
[20:01.33]Don't do it again!
[20:02.39]I'm alright.
[20:16.57]Funner.
[20:17.57]Funnest!
[20:17.91]What is this?
[20:19.93]I don't care, what is that even for?
[20:23.53]Hold on.
[20:46.15]Oh shit, hold on, get rid of those.
[20:47.53]Alright, so can I climb that wall?
[20:51.21]Does it have to be a specific cat wall?
[20:53.37]Oh!
[20:54.33]He falls off!
[21:14.78]So what Mario was this one from?
[21:16.66]Climb it.
[21:18.86]No, not climb it.
[21:21.18]Climb that.
[21:22.48]This is fun.
[21:37.94]Chat's really hot right now.
[21:39.20]That's because I played Super Mario Galaxy 1 ten years ago.
[21:44.82]And I just admitted that on the internet.
[21:50.65]So I may as well have, like, strangled three people.
[21:53.29]Alright, got the foundation.
[22:01.87]Two foundations.
[22:07.49]I haven't owned one since the Game Boy days?
[22:09.49]Relax.
[22:10.87]There's like some... Oh, they're in a nice gazebo.
[22:22.16]Castle's gonna be rock solid.
[22:23.90]Okay, let's get this castle rebuilt.
[22:25.24]Where do you want to start?
[22:27.48]Oh, I don't know.
[22:29.32]West Hall, Main Hall, East Hall.
[22:33.44]Hmm.
[22:35.00]What do you guys think?
[22:38.02]West.
[22:39.86]I mean... What I was about to say, who cares?
[22:45.16]I would be so desperately reaching for a reason at this point.
[22:51.57]Well, I used to live on the east coast, but now I live on the west coast.
[22:54.21]Who cares?
[22:54.67]What does that have to do with anything?
[23:05.93]Wait a minute.
[23:09.10]What about the one in the middle?
[23:09.88]I need more coins.
[23:15.74]Why do you hate these games?
[23:16.82]What?
[23:17.00]I don't hate these games!
[23:18.22]What?
[23:20.20]Where are you getting this?
[23:21.10]I'm getting them to another job.
[23:22.06]I'm not... I can't make a decision.
[23:25.73]Talk to the chief whenever you complete part of the castle.
[23:28.23]She'll have something new for you to build.
[23:32.97]No, the question... Why do you guys hate this game?
[23:34.93]When I told you I was playing Mario Maker 2, it was like...
[23:39.34]Really?
[23:39.70]Let's do this one.
[23:44.32]It was one guy?
[23:50.36]No, it was at least three.
[23:52.17]How many?
[23:52.49]Like 3,000 people here?
[23:53.39]At least three of you.
[23:54.81]That's 10%.
[23:55.13]Oh, that's like 0.1.
[23:55.65]That's 0.01%.
[23:56.63]So that's like pretty... I mean... I mean, that's as much... That was you.
[23:59.33]No...
[24:08.92]Hold on.
[24:09.26]Cool.
[24:09.36]Alright, which one is R?
[24:10.08]I haven't played this Switch in like a year.
[24:37.90]That's not it.
[24:39.04]That's not it.
[24:45.44]It actually flies down at you, too.
[24:50.13]I'll get it.
[24:50.51]I remember this from Mario 3.
[24:51.71]What's this thing?
[24:58.77]I've got, like, a bozo hat on?
[25:01.81]Oh, right.
[25:02.53]Now I've seen this before.
[25:03.33]I know what this one's like.
[25:08.27]How's this tricky?
[25:13.59]Oh wait, it is gonna get tricky here.
[25:16.87]Come on, come on, there's a secret up here or something.
[25:19.66]There's like a super coin up here.
[25:20.96]Ooh.
[25:27.78]It's not even tricky.
[25:30.20]Shit.
[25:32.13]No, no, I need that!
[25:33.71]There's ten in there!
[25:41.79]It's a distraction!
[25:43.01]Oh god.
[25:44.53]Thank god I got the fucking... Oh shit, wrong button.
[25:50.30]No!
[25:51.30]I bumped my desk!
[25:52.58]And it did that!
[25:54.62]Oh my god, it bumped the desk.
[25:57.96]My fat-like stomach leaned forward.
[26:00.74]And hit L. That wasn't that hard.
[26:03.01]Why are you freaking me out?
[26:14.59]Alright, now I've got enough.
[26:16.15]I'm going to do the middle.
[26:17.53]Let's do the expensive one first.
[26:18.55]I missed ten coins.
[26:25.65]It's okay.
[26:28.73]I'm alright with missing a few coins.
[26:32.33]Let's do the middle.
[26:32.89]Are you sure about this?
[26:35.67]I'm sure.
[26:38.24]Don't even build the left and right side.
[26:44.97]Just have a big cylinder in the middle.
[26:51.17]Main hall, first floor.
[26:52.41]Red Toad is heading up the project.
[26:54.87]We've got the construction covered.
[26:56.15]Just get out there and complete more jobs.
[27:02.98]Uh, I... I kinda love this.
[27:10.28]Is that weird?
[27:12.25]You can flip pages in the jobs list with L and R. And you can look for a list of incomplete jobs by pressing Y. Back to work.
[27:21.92]New jobs are in.
[27:22.64]Alright, hold on.
[27:24.20]The Mystery of the Haunted Manor.
[27:26.56]Swinging Claw Ropes Course.
[27:28.70]The Key Master.
[27:33.77]This game is perfect for my ADHD brain.
[27:37.27]Because I don't have to play any of the other Mario games.
[27:40.55]They're all here.
[27:42.76]This is a shitload of levels that are every single Mario game.
[27:45.86]Why would I need to play any of the other ones?
[27:52.57]Let's try this one.
[27:56.91]So I made a ghost house recently, but I think I got a bit over my head.
[27:59.43]Because I'm kind of sort of trapped in here.
[28:01.45]I should be able to get up at something strange about this place.
[28:04.51]Can someone come and help me?
[28:05.57]Alright, here we go.
[28:08.52]This one's a two star.
[28:11.58]It's too hard.
[28:19.68]It might be.
[28:21.68]See?
[28:21.86]This is great.
[28:27.16]Now, hold on a minute here.
[28:27.90]It's a ghost level, so I'm going to be deceived.
[28:36.00]Isn't there a kid who did the spin jump thing with Big Mario?
[28:39.89]Yeah, there it is.
[28:42.61]No, I shouldn't be doing this.
[28:43.37]Because those are going to turn into coins.
[28:54.57]Can you pick up the turnips?
[29:01.53]Yeah, you can.
[29:01.97]Alright, hold up.
[29:03.89]What does any of this mean?
[29:06.26]You can't... What?
[29:08.50]Oh!
[29:09.54]It's... Oh!
[29:10.58]Oh!
[29:11.28]It's the first time we've seen... I can... Oh, fuck.
[29:16.90]Stop it.
[29:29.33]Let me just go up.
[29:31.95]You can just jump off, Yoshi, right?
[29:38.98]Just eat them all.
[29:44.36]I can't eat that.
[29:45.08]He's dead.
[29:46.98]Oops.
[29:59.56]I can't jump on his head?
[30:00.60]Why not?
[30:16.47]It's a ghost.
[30:17.19]Wait, just take the other one.
[30:23.31]That's different for some reason.
[30:24.59]Oh.
[30:25.73]So I'm not crazy?
[30:27.83]Good to know.
[30:30.80]Alright, let's eat.
[30:32.86]I already know how this works.
[30:34.22]Don't worry, everybody.
[30:37.54]I know how to do this.
[30:39.90]See?
[30:41.10]Give me a break.
[30:46.08]I can do the two star levels.
[31:01.10]Uh-oh.
[31:01.96]But this is different.
[31:02.84]Okay, I don't want to do this one.
[31:05.72]Um, hold on.
[31:06.36]Let's go in the door.
[31:09.87]What the fuck was that?
[31:12.19]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[31:13.79]Alright, why is this P.T.
[31:14.93]Mario?
[31:29.78]Oh, God.
[31:30.26]Oh, God.
[31:31.40]Oh, fuck.
[31:35.63]Now what?
[31:35.99]Oh, I have to reset it.
[31:41.75]Oh, get... Come on.
[31:42.85]Lisa, get me up here.
[31:43.93]Wait, hold on.
[31:44.61]I want to get...
[31:55.91]There's another P. But... Is this going to take me out to the... Hold on.
[32:02.22]Let's go up.
[32:07.88]Alright, I've unlocked everything.
[32:10.98]What's this P?
[32:12.48]Oh, wait.
[32:13.71]Oh.
[32:14.05]Ooh.
[32:15.17]Oh.
[32:15.83]Okay.
[32:22.19]No, stay on, Yoshi.
[32:24.47]Oh.
[32:24.65]Ooh.
[32:25.13]Oh.
[32:25.45]Ooh.
[32:26.45]Oh!
[32:29.25]What does this one do?
[32:32.99]I wanna go in the P door.
[32:33.71]I want those 30 coins.
[32:38.70]Check this out.
[32:57.90]You're going too slow.
[33:02.24]Got it.
[33:03.54]How do I get out of here?
[33:05.56]Can I not be on Yoshi?
[33:11.50]Oh.
[33:12.50]Oh.
[33:13.42]I think that's it, right?
[33:18.50]Yeah.
[33:19.12]I'm not soft locked.
[33:22.48]I'm fine.
[33:25.30]Now that I did that... Now we...
[33:31.43]But, wait.
[33:32.58]What's... Am I going to get a P?
[33:35.36]I could have brought a P with me, probably.
[33:37.14]But what about this door?
[33:47.44]Why have... I don't understand why I have that door.
[33:51.33]Oh!
[34:09.63]That hurt my ears.
[34:10.37]I'm sorry.
[34:11.97]I'm sorry.
[34:13.63]Yeah, that was really fucking loud.
[34:14.87]I just... I'm sorry about that.
[34:18.43]But, I mean, that was a times ten.
[34:19.83]Sometimes you have to scream.
[34:23.45]How we doing?
[34:23.85]Any more?
[34:24.19]More coins?
[34:32.13]I... I did peek the mic.
[34:34.50]So people that have been asking about that for, like, six months, you got it.
[34:45.83]Alright, this one's easy.
[34:47.52]We rebuild the castle.
[34:49.24]What if this is the whole stream?
[34:53.46]Right?
[34:53.72]Alright.
[34:59.52]This is hard.
[35:03.45]I buried some coins in an underground room.
[35:06.61]What do I care?
[35:07.15]Coins mean nothing to me anymore.
[35:10.59]Way to be dick about it.
[35:11.53]Alright, reach the goal after grabbing all 30 coins.
[35:13.71]I have to get all 30 coins.
[35:23.16]Reach the goal after grabbing all 30.
[35:24.40]I don't have a hat anymore?
[35:28.79]Reach the goal after grabbing all 30.
[35:31.01]Well, I can tell you right now, look at my brain just working.
[35:34.54]Look at how good this brain is.
[35:36.72]There's going to be one up here that they don't tell you about.
[35:43.51]No.
[35:43.65]Alright, these are all things I didn't even know you could do in Mario.
[35:46.09]What's up with this weird top thing?
[35:53.83]This brain.
[35:54.65]Ooh!
[36:00.32]This is just like the old game.
[36:04.08]Remember that old game?
[36:09.15]I can't believe I just got fucking reverse-packed, man.
[36:10.89]God damn it.
[36:24.68]Alright, now I know what's going on.
[36:25.70]Now I know that the ha- Wait.
[36:26.54]There's only one.
[36:28.70]I'm not taking it.
[36:30.10]I'm gonna need it, eventually.
[36:41.87]Remember the lobsters?
[36:42.65]Used to do this to the lobsters, yup.
[36:48.20]And they never brought that enemy back.
[36:50.36]They never brought back the weird crab lobster thing.
[36:54.94]Oh, god damn it.
[36:55.84]I didn't want to do that.
[37:08.43]Don't do it again!
[37:09.21]That stuff's screaming, fuck.
[37:16.06]I gotta put a limiter on my voice.
[37:19.10]No, let's not kill every enemy.
[37:24.58]Just collect all coins.
[37:28.11]Oh, that's why I need the, uh... That's why I need the star!
[37:32.45]Uh-oh.
[37:35.25]Tricky!
[37:36.81]Where they going?
[37:39.51]Tricky!
[37:41.64]Why would I go in this one?
[37:50.17]Oh, it was just an illusion.
[37:52.39]Well, who cares?
[37:52.95]I got your coins.
[37:58.80]I'm gonna kick him over here.
[38:04.10]No, he's gonna... Oh.
[38:11.39]Where's it going?
[38:13.89]Oh!
[38:15.47]I can't do it.
[38:16.63]I'm so...
[38:18.59]Holy shit, I almost died.
[38:20.09]Just give me the coin and get me out.
[38:21.01]30.
[38:21.03]I win, right?
[38:22.20]Secrets?
[38:53.92]Got it.
[39:00.22]No, I'm not doing left and right.
[39:01.04]We're going straight up.
[39:03.36]I'm doing main hall 4.
[39:05.24]And then main hall 2F.
[39:12.52]So you can do any amount of them, right?
[39:14.98]You can do a million of them if you want.
[39:16.56]Alright, swinging claw ropes.
[39:20.08]Oops!
[39:20.52]I should have read that.
[39:21.54]No, but everyone... That's alright.
[39:24.26]That was unsatisfying, what I just did.
[39:25.66]It was very satisfying.
[39:28.40]And this is original.
[39:30.86]Cake Mario.
[39:37.96]There it is.
[39:38.62]There's Cake Mario.
[39:40.29]I knew I was going to see it eventually.
[39:42.93]Oof.
[39:44.89]Didn't get it.
[39:55.37]Sorry.
[39:59.02]Why did I get that?
[40:09.68]No, no, no.
[40:10.16]I want those coins.
[40:10.72]I need the coins to build the castle.
[40:12.78]I gotta itch my face.
[40:17.07]Wait.
[40:18.41]How do I get that?
[40:20.47]I think I needed those turtles.
[40:27.94]Yeah, I need the turtles for that one.
[40:31.04]I can't wall jump in this one.
[40:34.72]Dude, no balls.
[40:35.73]Why would I just die?
[40:44.63]No!
[40:46.47]Send me back.
[40:47.11]Send me put... Send me back!
[40:49.02]Send me back.
[40:50.70]Send me back.
[40:51.26]I can get it.
[41:22.09]I can feel every single one of those.
[41:31.35]I'm not going to spend any of it.
[41:33.31]I'm going to wait till I get to 10 grand.
[41:35.71]I'm going to put it on one hand of blackjack.
[41:42.72]Wait, what did she say?
[41:46.48]We've got work to do.
[41:47.26]Yeah, I know.
[41:51.12]You want jobs?
[41:51.68]I got jobs.
[41:52.52]Shoe stopper.
[41:54.59]These shoe goompers are too much, but the kicks they have rocking are useful because you can walk over spike traps.
[42:01.27]The shoes probably don't smell great, but you can always press R to take them off.
[42:04.13]And if you find a big shoe, you can always slam down by tilting down in the air.
[42:11.50]Hey, Tickle!
[42:22.97]Oh, that's a cool snow level.
[42:30.79]Oh, it's a song from Undertale!
[42:31.95]Beanbag Mario.
[42:57.71]I tried.
[42:58.09]I thought I could get it.
[42:59.47]I got greedy.
[43:01.55]What I just did right there is the equivalent of staying in and swinging one more time in Dark Souls.
[43:05.86]And knowing it's a bad idea, but you're still gonna try it no matter what.
[43:08.32]See?
[43:08.62]Like I did it again.
[43:09.18]I need another shoe.
[43:30.90]Beanbag Mario and Beanbag Sonic should be friends.
[43:35.93]That's what somebody said, I think, or something like that.
[43:37.53]I'm paraphrasing.
[43:46.27]Whoa.
[43:46.83]I just crashed into that guy.
[43:50.24]There's a big shoe!
[43:51.08]Give me the big shoe.
[43:53.36]I can't get in the big one?
[43:55.50]Yes, I can.
[43:58.93]I can't get in the giant shoe tank.
[44:00.73]Of course I can.
[44:03.33]Uh... What?
[44:08.28]What happened there?
[44:11.52]Ooh, that was one pixel that I didn't get on that.
[44:16.00]Wait, hold on.
[44:17.06]Can I...?
[44:19.20]No, I'm too big.
[44:22.74]I need a little shoe.
[44:24.25]Any more little shoes?
[44:26.33]Is this a giant high heel?
[44:27.69]Alright, hold on, wait.
[44:31.33]I need to get the giant heel.
[44:33.61]How do I get that?
[44:45.10]Oh shit, oh shit.
[44:50.48]I need to get in there.
[44:54.82]How does one get in there?
[44:57.70]I don't know why I'm so paranoid to jump on these guys.
[45:12.21]I can jump on those guys, right?
[45:13.79]It was the flame that hit me.
[45:16.99]Yeah, alright.
[45:19.91]Alright, I gotta do this.
[45:21.27]Ready?
[45:27.69]I feel like I'm playing Joust right now and I don't like it.
[45:33.69]It's making me feel panicky.
[45:34.89]Shit, I needed that.
[45:36.91]No, not even worth it.
[45:56.40]I should have jumped out.
[45:57.06]What am I doing?
[46:06.17]Go back.
[46:08.21]You can't get them all.
[46:09.63]Alright, first hall.
[46:17.76]First main hall, first floor is done.
[46:21.48]How much is the second one?
[46:28.17]Cool.
[46:33.25]Wait.
[46:35.79]You got a new building, right?
[46:38.79]Looking good.
[46:39.43]Go, chief.
[46:40.87]Oh, right.
[46:41.23]You can press R to see the whole castle.
[46:43.39]We have new building options now.
[46:46.45]Yep. 1200.
[46:58.85]I'm almost out of jobs.
[47:01.42]What happens when all the jobs go away?
[47:06.40]So I made a ghost house.
[47:07.40]I'll pay anyone who can make it to the end.
[47:08.90]Here's a little hint.
[47:09.46]You'll need four keys.
[47:11.81]More if you want to get the true ending.
[47:14.43]Wink.
[47:22.17]So I need more keys to get the true ending.
[47:24.14]I've got to try to get the true ending.
[47:32.38]A little horn.
[47:34.26]Alright, well, there's one key.
[47:37.33]I can't get it right now.
[47:42.47]So, we've got options here.
[47:43.65]We've got our spring, which... Do I have to bring it somewhere?
[47:51.74]I mean, I don't know.
[47:56.74]There's nothing in here.
[47:59.44]It's probably hit... I just fucked myself completely.
[48:02.32]Can I, like, even get out of here without him killing me?
[48:06.68]No.
[48:07.40]That pixel was bullshit.
[48:08.40]Did you see that?
[48:10.65]What happened there?
[48:16.11]Oh, really?
[48:20.63]I have to... I need to get bigger.
[48:24.63]Hold on.
[48:29.74]Can I make it all the way back and grab the thing?
[48:31.90]Yes, there it is.
[48:44.85]Found it.
[48:46.47]Ding dong.
[48:48.21]Three keys.
[48:59.73]Now, what's in the other round?
[49:00.53]I need a POW.
[49:01.59]I'm going to take a guess and say the POW is going to go in this one.
[49:04.59]This one... This one right here.
[49:06.49]I don't know.
[49:13.19]Well, I kicked it.
[49:14.71]How do I get the secret key in here?
[49:20.52]Spring?
[49:29.59]Well, give me the pow.
[49:35.77]It's gonna get me killed.
[49:36.79]Just get in the... Get in there!
[49:38.57]Oh, they have melted ghosts now.
[49:41.94]Whoa.
[49:43.36]Wow!
[49:46.12]Alright, I didn't even need this.
[49:58.65]I don't know why, but I thought there was fall damage for a second.
[50:04.27]So there's one on the other side.
[50:05.75]A couple more?
[50:07.09]Oh, here we go.
[50:10.91]This one?
[50:11.29]I don't know.
[50:16.58]I think that's it.
[50:18.04]I think I did it.
[50:21.52]Oh, no I didn't.
[50:23.26]But that's the right place.
[50:30.39]Get a mushroom?
[50:30.95]Nah, I live dangerously.
[50:31.81]I'm gonna do it without a mushroom.
[50:36.20]That's too much time.
[50:48.82]Oh, fuck, I should have listened!
[50:51.48]Alright, I'm gonna get a mushroom.
[50:58.94]This is gonna freak me out.
[51:02.88]You're right.
[51:03.40]I need to get a mushroom.
[51:04.14]You're correct.
[51:04.60]I know.
[51:05.12]I'm gonna listen.
[51:05.72]Just give one to me.
[51:14.45]So there's the fourth key right there, which is the P, but I'm not doing that.
[51:17.75]Because I want to get the true ending.
[51:21.01]So we need to bring the spring somewhere.
[51:23.55]I don't know where I do this.
[51:24.75]Over here?
[51:25.39]What is it like in here?
[51:30.81]Yeah, there we go.
[51:37.82]No, I need to get you... This is like a... You fly up?
[51:40.74]So how do I move you over there?
[51:42.00]How do I get you to move?
[51:57.65]Is it an enemy?
[52:00.18]No, it's not an enemy.
[52:00.92]Okay.
[52:13.58]Wait, will he actually... No, give this to me.
[52:18.72]No, I want it to be... No, give it... Put it down here.
[52:21.02]Here we go.
[52:28.96]Alright, I got the five keys.
[52:30.12]No, I don't.
[52:30.68]Not yet.
[52:30.96]What?
[52:40.17]Get up there!
[52:40.79]Why is it- what?
[52:44.61]Am I insane?
[52:45.35]Alright, I got them all.
[52:54.52]The fifth key is there, and I get the secret ending.
[53:06.93]Five.
[53:08.81]Out the door.
[53:09.45]Two, three, four, five.
[53:13.31]Two.
[53:17.29]Three.
[53:21.13]Four.
[53:24.85]Five.
[53:25.55]What do I do with the fifth one?
[53:34.70]What?
[53:45.51]I need more keys?
[53:47.67]They said five!
[53:54.74]No, nobody said five.
[53:56.36]They said find more.
[54:00.06]Four or more, not five.
[54:04.25]There's so many.
[54:05.25]That's a lot of coins though.
[54:06.81]Alright, so what have I not used?
[54:12.53]Only three more keys?
[54:17.34]I guess I didn't go... I didn't go in this.
[54:18.84]Let me look in here.
[54:19.46]Well, this is obviously... I need another... I need the spring here.
[54:29.20]And then we jump... I get it.
[54:32.14]Check this out.
[54:32.76]Spring over on the left.
[54:37.52]Yeah.
[54:38.66]And then I'm going to jump from spring to spring, and I should get it.
[54:46.92]No, I need this one over here Everybody thought I was stupid
[55:18.68]Come on, guys.
[55:22.40]Really?
[55:25.08]The intent was there.
[55:26.26]Alright, now this.
[55:26.82]What about this one?
[55:31.81]No, no, no.
[55:32.33]It's the other one.
[55:36.89]Right here.
[55:37.37]So how do I do this?
[55:39.59]The spring?
[55:40.19]The pow?
[55:40.89]No.
[55:41.89]It's probably the spring.
[55:43.21]I have to get on top of that.
[55:48.17]Obviously have to get on top of this.
[55:51.13]Oh, shit.
[55:51.98]Okay, now I'm gonna hit a... There's a secret block somewhere here, and it's probably gonna be, like, right here.
[55:59.84]Oh, fuck!
[56:00.52]How about over here?
[56:01.27]Here?
[56:02.37]Here?
[56:02.55]I'm gonna jump from a spring up.
[56:13.49]Oh god, this isn't going to kill me.
[56:15.97]Hold on, I need a mushroom.
[56:17.67]I need to get a mushroom first.
[56:18.51]I'll screw this up.
[56:20.24]What's that sound?
[56:20.92]What?
[56:21.18]Oh god, I have 100 seconds.
[56:22.64]I need one more.
[56:26.76]Where's the last one?
[56:27.58]Hold on, give me a mushroom.
[56:36.81]There's one more.
[56:38.51]Where is it?
[56:38.97]It's the P. P, right?
[56:47.11]Hurry, hurry!
[56:47.53]Go, go, go, go!
[56:49.09]Did I get this one?
[56:49.79]I already got this one!
[57:04.38]Wait, what about, what about if I'm getting, if it's like, uh, Far Cry 4, you just have to go in the beginning.
[57:27.06]Up there?
[57:27.42]No, it's too late.
[57:39.13]It's too late.
[57:39.53]I don't have time.
[57:40.87]Oh, I have to come back and do this again?
[57:42.13]I got 40.
[57:43.98]No, no.
[57:44.20]I gotta go.
[57:44.60]Get out.
[57:44.84]Out.
[57:44.98]Out.
[57:45.08]Get out of the way.
[57:53.31]That's a lot of coins, but I don't... I can't... I'm not... I can't do it.
[57:59.09]Anything else in here?
[57:59.63]Just check in here.
[58:04.03]Nothing else?
[58:05.75]Two, three, fuck.
[58:18.76]No, just...
[58:25.38]Restart it?
[58:27.71]No, I'm not gonna restart it.
[58:28.73]I'm just gonna do it.
[58:30.79]I'm just gonna finish it.
[58:32.30]Use the...
[58:58.14]I feel so unfulfilled, though.
[59:01.46]See, I would have gone at zero, but I don't know in Mario, specifically this one, does it kill you at zero or zero one die?
[59:09.55]I wasn't going to take that risk.
[59:18.72]Redo it.
[59:19.76]Alright, I'm going to redo it.
[59:26.60]Let's go!
[59:27.81]So where's the first one?
[59:29.41]I know how to get them all.
[59:37.08]So I'll just get them all quick.
[59:39.16]This won't take very long.
[59:46.72]I'm going to start with Pau.
[59:47.42]We're going to go to the right up this one.
[59:49.28]I have plenty of time.
[59:52.24]500 seconds is like 12 minutes.
[59:54.48]I got plenty of time.
[60:09.40]Seven minutes.
[60:10.10]Yeah, but whatever.
[60:11.34]It's enough time.
[60:12.60]Give me the spring.
[60:13.36]I got springs over here.
[60:15.70]Straight up this one.
[60:18.50]I'm not going to turn it in until I have it.
[60:20.36]When I used to play Diablo 3, and I mean, that game's not like that great, but when I used to do the bounties, I would collect the bounties and have like ten of them and open them all at the same time.
[60:29.17]I would have all eight keys.
[60:30.67]Oh my god, he almost got me.
[60:47.80]Sometimes it would be 20.
[60:48.72]I don't have time for this shit.
[60:56.25]Come on.
[61:05.44]Even Mario was looking at that going like, alright, come on.
[61:12.84]Alright, that's all of them over here.
[61:14.96]Get the P.
[61:18.80]coins.
[61:23.39]You can be Luigi.
[61:25.87]I want to be Luigi.
[61:31.93]Wait, is that a joke?
[61:32.71]I thought you were joking.
[61:34.49]I'm sorry.
[61:48.45]I need this.
[62:00.98]Watch this.
[62:05.58]Ready?
[62:05.76]Wasn't that cool, but it could have been.
[62:10.16]Can I hit it like this?
[62:18.62]No.
[62:20.30]There we go.
[62:20.78]But I still have to grab it.
[62:22.26]No, I don't.
[62:22.68]It's free.
[62:23.66]One, two... I'm trying to count the keys.
[62:27.85]One, two, three.
[62:28.41]I only have five.
[62:29.33]How did I get the other ones?
[62:42.21]Oh, there's one there.
[62:43.07]Right, okay.
[62:44.93]So that would be six.
[62:50.49]Oh, he had the conveyor room, right.
[62:59.24]Does this kill him?
[62:59.80]It does.
[63:02.14]Should've used it before.
[63:03.06]Alright.
[63:08.78]Look at all those bounty caches I got.
[63:10.80]Look at all those bounty boxes.
[63:11.90]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[63:13.74]Seven.
[63:14.20]One more.
[63:18.51]So, let's see.
[63:19.17]I'm gonna say...
[63:23.04]No, you idiot.
[63:28.70]No, there's one more.
[63:29.56]There's one there.
[63:30.12]I need to go find one more.
[63:31.81]Let's see, up here.
[63:32.47]And there it is.
[63:35.25]What?
[63:41.11]What the hell do I do with this?
[63:53.07]What's wrong with him?
[63:57.71]Is it a battery?
[64:06.94]Did I just give him like a battery?
[64:25.83]Let's go.
[64:30.20]Oh my god.
[64:30.84]I'm gonna go up.
[64:40.06]Got them all.
[64:41.68]Alright, I just ripped his brain out.
[64:46.03]Have a nice life.
[64:49.47]I did it!
[64:49.79]Now I get all those coins.
[65:06.73]And I've got time to spare.
[65:15.49]The good ending.
[65:16.73]The expensive ending.
[65:24.13]Again, it's the anxiety music.
[65:29.32]And why is it still on?
[65:35.25]Will the Jack in the Box come out already?
[65:36.97]I'm waiting for him to pop out.
[65:50.25]That's a lot of coins.
[65:52.00]That was a nice little song.
[65:57.76]I have to get these all.
[66:12.67]Why would that be there?
[66:13.81]Oh, uh, why would that be there?
[66:24.06]Oh, god.
[66:24.64]Oh, well.
[66:30.24]Uh, whatever.
[66:31.28]It's alright.
[66:31.84]I can get him back.
[66:36.36]Those last three coins are just trapped.
[66:38.98]You can't get them.
[66:39.90]Yeah.
[66:40.64]Oh, no.
[66:44.62]Where did it go?
[66:45.26]What did I just throw it to?
[66:51.14]What?
[66:52.52]I threw it... That's so dumb.
[67:03.98]At least you got the coins.
[67:05.18]Yeah, and then they all... This game Sonic the Hedgehogs you.
[67:08.01]You lose them all.
[67:14.02]Yeah, it was for three coins.
[67:18.32]Come here.
[67:19.66]No.
[67:20.12]I want it in here.
[67:23.29]Stop picking it up.
[67:54.06]Get the POW.
[67:55.92]Ugh.
[67:57.06]I really didn't think I was going to be on this for this long.
[68:06.41]Slow it down.
[68:06.87]I don't want to mess it up again.
[68:09.31]And I didn't even mess it up.
[68:10.11]I got trolled last time.
[68:11.75]So that doesn't count.
[68:16.61]Third first try.
[68:17.91]Okay.
[68:27.98]Alright, let's make this happen.
[68:32.19]Let's get the coins first.
[68:33.61]Got it!
[68:49.95]Alright, then we just have to do the throw.
[68:54.18]I'm just going to take the POW.
[68:56.10]Just do this one.
[68:57.62]It's right here.
[69:10.01]Get it.
[69:10.27]How about we do just the pancake?
[69:14.77]Alright, that's it.
[69:18.81]Right into the...
[69:22.30]This one here.
[69:24.88]He sounds annoyed.
[69:25.96]I'm not annoyed.
[69:29.71]Am I tall enough to get this?
[69:39.70]It's one coin.
[69:48.92]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[69:51.46]The last one is up there.
[69:54.94]This time I'm gonna bring the spring.
[70:00.86]I'm gonna go get a spring.
[70:01.72]Can I go get a spring and put it here?
[70:04.48]Here we go.
[70:12.19]Come on down.
[70:20.61]You can keep your brain this time.
[70:21.59]Alright, now I'm going to bring the spring up here.
[70:31.99]So, let's... Hold on.
[70:33.53]Can I... No, I have to do this first.
[70:39.91]I've got to get the key, come back, get the coins.
[70:42.99]Alright.
[70:43.29]I can just step on it now.
[70:45.23]I don't...
[70:56.52]Alright, good.
[70:57.40]I'm ready.
[70:58.36]That's 8, right?
[70:59.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[70:59.76]Hooray!
[71:00.12]Alright, up.
[71:22.19]Same deal, this time don't fall through the hole.
[71:33.08]And I get to build this next part of the castle.
[71:38.78]This is worth doing.
[71:42.10]Hey, you get to hear the song again.
[71:52.78]Oh shit!
[71:53.06]Is there anything up there?
[72:06.65]Oh, I did it.
[72:08.85]It's still x10.
[72:09.51]x10 is not even a big deal.
[72:10.71]Why did I scream?
[72:23.31]Castle level 2.
[72:27.76]Let's do it.
[72:32.80]Bingo.
[72:33.76]You sure about this?
[72:34.74]I am sure.
[72:37.46]Nice.
[72:42.31]More jobs.
[72:48.27]More jobs.
[72:48.91]Six new jobs.
[72:53.23]That's one hot car.
[72:57.94]Yo, this fire junior clown car course that I made is off the hook.
[73:02.94]Hold Y to charge up your cannon and then let it go to fire a charge shot that can cook fools and bust hard blocks.
[73:10.86]Press R to get out of the car.
[73:13.82]You need to go down that, you need to go down a pipe at some point.
[73:19.42]What?
[73:19.86]Is there an actual clown car level in this game?
[73:29.37]Hold Y to charge.
[73:31.43]Oh, it's not really a real clown car.
[73:40.64]That felt good.
[73:42.44]Get coins.
[73:48.76]Hey, hey, hey!
[73:54.31]Let's grab him.
[73:57.01]I can't get hurt down here.
[74:06.02]I almost got hit by that bullet.
[74:06.84]I don't know why.
[74:07.59]I thought it was an indicator.
[74:11.35]It's R to get out, right?
[74:24.36]Alright, I gotta get a pipe at some point, right?
[74:27.06]Wait, not yet.
[74:27.74]There's probably something over here.
[74:31.86]Nothing?
[74:32.86]Oh.
[74:34.51]That's too bad.
[74:42.37]I can... Ooh, that's cool.
[74:49.17]People are gonna make some cool shit with this, definitely.
[74:56.12]Upgraded triple shot.
[74:57.21]I cannot get rid of the cannons, but yes I can.
[75:04.55]Drop them in!
[75:05.15]I think I just made this harder for myself.
[75:13.24]Kind of.
[75:23.32]Get it there!
[75:23.74]Go, go, go, go, go!
[75:24.28]Get up!
[75:30.54]You can make a bullet hell, yeah.
[75:35.62]Oh shit.
[75:36.64]I tried to duck.
[75:37.44]That's not gonna work.
[75:38.12]Just get up.
[75:41.05]Oh my god, I'm standing in front of it.
[75:48.31]Alright, into the cup.
[76:08.63]Touch the axe!
[76:09.83]Touch the axe!
[76:10.55]I did it!
[76:30.79]Hmm.
[76:31.59]Continue the build.
[76:32.53]You just killed an entire castle so you could build your own.
[76:43.94]My castle's not evil.
[76:50.09]Swinging Claws.
[76:51.93]Ooh, cool.
[77:00.19]Imperialism.
[77:01.16]No, I'm taking out the evil people.
[77:06.36]Oh, I love when they do this style.
[77:10.56]Makes me feel like I'm just working on a Game Boy.
[77:12.38]How do I get up there?
[77:18.62]Get over here, Goomba.
[77:25.45]I need to jump on you to get up there.
[77:32.51]Oh, god damn it, come on.
[77:38.22]No, pick him up!
[77:39.50]Pick up the Goomba!
[77:43.88]Alright, then I have to get close when he gets close enough.
[77:46.71]Don't do that yet.
[77:49.27]No, no, I want to drop him on that.
[77:50.69]Because below that hat would do something?
[77:54.51]Nice, there it is.
[78:01.72]More claw game.
[78:03.06]Alright, then drop them here.
[78:05.16]Oh shit, hold on.
[78:07.44]Alright, then drop them here, on this prize machine.
[78:22.96]This is cool.
[78:30.25]This is innovative.
[78:33.22]Oh, they, you have, I get it.
[78:35.22]Pick him up, and then you have to put him down here.
[78:38.78]So, oh god.
[78:39.94]Alright, hold on.
[78:45.64]Pick him up, and then place him over there.
[78:51.69]No, get him!
[78:54.35]Get, somebody get him!
[78:56.39]He'll get him on the way back, right there.
[78:58.39]Right now.
[78:59.35]Got it, alright, and then... Let it go.
[79:08.85]You gonna pick me up?
[79:11.54]Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[79:12.24]What's going on here?
[79:18.40]And then you gotta drop him on there.
[79:19.63]Pick him up!
[79:20.11]And then bring him this way.
[79:21.81]Oh shit, he died.
[79:42.78]Alright, put him in that.
[79:44.58]Ding dong.
[79:49.46]Now you... I didn't think they were going to come down here.
[79:53.07]Oh shit, I need to get in that.
[79:54.17]Alright, now don't die here.
[79:57.73]Are those... Does this flappy bird shit kill you?
[80:00.21]No.
[80:13.56]That was cute.
[80:14.28]That was a cute one.
[80:25.17]Two more levels and I can build.
[80:26.17]It's probably going to be way too much money.
[80:32.84]Tree top fireballs.
[80:33.98]I managed to plant some trees and they actually look pretty good.
[80:38.38]Can you try climbing all 12 of my trees?
[80:41.70]Yes, I can.
[80:51.22]Do the harder ones?
[80:52.01]Well, I want to just get them all done.
[80:55.41]I'm just doing them as they come.
[80:56.87]Climb on the trees.
[80:57.69]One.
[81:01.75]The snow comes off, too?
[81:03.83]They've thought of everything.
[81:06.62]What the hell is this doing?
[81:09.20]Okay.
[81:09.44]I don't know, I don't know what that does, but whatever.
[81:13.62]Is that gonna hurt me?
[81:14.67]No, it's just there.
[81:37.53]How many more trees?
[81:38.99]Only one to kill that guy.
[81:41.95]It's usually like six.
[81:46.00]Okay.
[82:12.14]Alright, they give me a nice little break.
[82:13.64]I fucked it up.
[82:20.47]It's burning the locals to death.
[82:25.41]I mean, are these... They're killing us!
[82:29.97]They're trying to kill me!
[82:31.07]No, they're not.
[82:32.53]They're kind of not at all.
[82:44.31]How is this not 12?
[82:49.24]Did I miss one?
[82:51.86]Oh, it's right here, okay.
[83:18.13]What just... I was... You can climb the pole and... Alright, I got a pretty good score regardless.
[83:32.83]$174.
[83:32.85]Alright, one more and then I'm going to find out if I don't have enough money.
[83:40.43]We'll find out real quick.
[83:44.77]Plenty of cheap cheeps in the sea.
[83:46.59]Is this swimming level?
[83:47.30]This is going to be horrible.
[83:50.58]There's way too many cheap cheeps.
[83:53.64]Is it even possible to beat this?
[83:55.04]Someone help me.
[83:58.30]Well, Toad, you have to be able to beat your own level before you put it up here.
[84:02.09]So, you had to have already beaten this.
[84:05.13]Nice lie.
[84:08.47]Oh, it's a water level.
[84:09.41]Might as well skip it.
[84:19.43]I hate these water levels.
[84:20.66]I don't have the kind of control that I'm looking for, the exact precision that I want.
[84:25.92]It always causes me a huge problem.
[84:34.47]Although this is not that hard.
[84:39.09]Nobody likes water levels, no.
[84:41.25]Oh no, no, no, it's like timed.
[84:50.20]I thought that was a mushroom I was able to grab one.
[84:57.74]Okay, good.
[84:59.52]Wasn't that bad.
[85:05.99]Wasn't as bad as I made it out to seem like.
[85:10.43]Timed underwater escort mission, yep.
[85:12.25]Oh, and there's the tweedleees, whatever they're called.
[85:15.49]What are those actual caterpillar things called?
[85:40.94]Got it!
[85:47.80]Mario time.
[85:51.96]The Wiggles?
[86:06.23]There it is.
[86:07.45]Now let's do Middle Hall 3.
[86:16.73]It's so beautiful.
[86:18.39]Keep up the good work.
[86:19.25]We're gonna try.
[86:20.59]Oh, I have to do something else now.
[86:22.42]I got the money to do it.
[86:23.14]Let's do West Hall.
[86:29.86]Can't just go straight up.
[86:30.68]Sorry.
[86:33.90]I also have enough money to do these halls as well.
[86:39.09]Do them both.
[86:46.55]We get more jobs.
[86:58.84]Six new jobs, six new jobs, six new jobs.
[87:03.50]Something about this is just actually very, very satisfying to play.
[87:06.83]Alright, so let's do... Let's do a hard one.
[87:11.41]This is a hard one.
[87:12.15]No jumping allowed.
[87:14.59]Here's a challenge.
[87:15.29]Try to get through the whole level without jumping off the ground and landing.
[87:18.99]Any takers?
[87:19.49]Anyone?
[87:19.90]There's a prize for anyone who succeeds.
[87:21.44]Here's a hint.
[87:21.92]Use Y to dash.
[87:24.90]The Game Master.
[87:25.62]I can't jump.
[87:33.77]Reach the goal without landing after leaving the ground.
[87:41.83]So wait.
[87:43.03]What do you mean without landing after leaving the ground?
[87:45.05]Does that count if I land up there?
[87:46.47]If I land up top there, does it count?
[87:49.10]I didn't even make it fucking 10 steps.
[87:59.06]I tried to...
[88:06.50]Whoa, no!
[88:11.76]I gotta get my fucking brain.
[88:18.56]No, I don't need to be Luigi, don't worry.
[88:25.47]What the fuck?
[88:26.09]I thought he was gonna go down!
[88:27.39]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose all my characters!
[88:31.69]I thought he was gonna go down into the ground after passing once.
[88:35.97]Oh no, here he comes.
[88:52.77]Wait, does that count?
[88:53.55]That doesn't count, right?
[88:56.01]Because I'm not touching the ground.
[88:57.82]That's a donut, that's not a ground.
[89:10.65]Okay.
[89:14.77]Oh, shit.
[89:18.60]Alright, give me a flag.
[89:29.02]What?
[89:31.30]Do they have a platform?
[89:32.60]I can't go- I don't want to go down.
[89:37.52]Oh, fuck.
[89:43.41]Do I have to stand on that?
[89:47.25]Oh my god!
[89:52.46]What happens if I run out of lives?
[89:58.08]What happens if I run out of... Does anyone know?
[90:06.51]Your save gets deleted.
[90:09.17]That's false.
[90:24.14]You get reincarnated as an ant.
[90:26.97]Ooh.
[90:27.85]Interesting.
[90:34.20]Come on down.
[90:34.70]What are they shooting?
[90:38.18]Alright, that just freaked me out.
[90:41.74]Now, this is important, so... Let me watch him.
[90:44.49]I need to see where he goes.
[90:47.20]He runs over here, and then- I didn't even move.
[90:50.48]I didn't even- I didn't even fucking move, okay?
[90:53.00]That freaked me out!
[90:55.05]What happens if I do- I didn't even move!
[91:04.81]I have to complete this.
[91:06.02]No, I can't- Tape the button down.
[91:16.91]Too bad.
[91:18.49]Do I lose the game?
[91:19.35]Did I just lose?
[91:28.30]He can do it for you.
[91:38.82]Do we get to watch him play it?
[91:44.50]I hope it's actually a cell phone call.
[91:46.30]I hope you actually call him.
[92:05.35]Hello?
[92:06.89]Hey, can you help me beat this level?
[92:10.82]I'm in traffic right now.
[92:13.75]Stop fucking calling me.
[92:15.79]Oh shit!
[92:24.11]I didn't jump!
[92:31.83]Everybody gets a one.
[92:34.53]You call it 15 times.
[92:38.97]The game just launched.
[92:42.63]Maybe you should try... What is that game?
[92:50.50]Candy Crush.
[93:08.54]Okay, I don't understand this.
[93:10.90]Here we go.
[93:12.25]I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!
[93:13.23]I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!
[93:14.31]I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT!
[93:15.57]I have to use the draw- uh, it's- I'm gonna let him do it.
[93:21.77]I'm gonna call Luigi.
[93:22.87]I'm gonna say, like, hurry home from work.
[93:26.09]I need you to beat a level for me.
[93:29.55]I had to stand still until I did it the last time, and I fell off his head, and it discounted me!
[93:52.14]Alright, I'm gonna do it this time.
[93:53.50]I'm not fucking this up.
[93:54.16]I'm just gonna stand still on his head.
[93:56.55]Come on, Booz.
[93:57.13]Let's go.
[93:57.51]Wh- Now what?
[94:13.34]Hurry!
[94:13.70]They're coming!
[94:21.21]Wait, what do I do about this?
[94:25.45]What?!
[94:28.21]What happened?!
[94:37.92]Oh no!
[94:51.28]You went into the air?
[94:52.26]I didn't go in the air!
[94:53.30]I didn't go in the air.
[94:56.10]Did I already lose?
[95:03.12]Nah, I gotta call Luigi.
[95:08.75]What was that?
[95:09.23]What happened?
[95:09.67]What happened?
[95:12.17]What happened?
[95:36.31]Let me try again.
[95:42.05]Hi, this is Luigi.
[95:44.27]Mamma mia.
[95:45.79]Call me back at a later date.
[95:47.87]Leave a message.
[95:49.45]What happened?
[95:50.03]I could just call him.
[95:50.69]What's going on?
[95:58.21]I...
[96:06.36]I can't.
[96:06.74]He has to do it.
[96:08.20]I can't.
[96:08.58]I have to press like.
[96:09.58]I can't do it.
[96:11.74]This task is too much for me to do.
[96:13.98]It really is.
[96:14.39]I just can't do it.
[96:15.85]I'm like looking over at chat and I'm like fucking falling off the ground.
[96:19.19]I can't do it.
[96:19.91]I can't.
[96:20.21]I can do it.
[96:20.67]I'll do it.
[96:26.91]Guys, I can't.
[96:27.57]Luigi.
[96:28.27]I can't call Luigi anymore.
[96:32.26]He called up Verizon and had my number fucking blocked.
[96:35.50]Permanently.
[96:56.72]Okay, so what happened here?
[97:07.53]Just stand on it and just let it... I walked off.
[97:14.15]Give me a break.
[97:16.97]There's even more of this shit.
[97:19.14]Now what?
[97:39.59]Get up!
[97:52.90]What?
[97:57.58]What's over here?
[97:58.98]Should I let this pick me up?
[98:02.88]I wasn't fast enough I need to watch this for a minute
[98:12.71]Two.
[98:15.43]Two.
[98:19.91]How do I get that?
[98:28.07]Um... Will the bomb blow it up?
[98:38.02]They can disappear!
[98:48.00]What's the purpose of that?
[98:48.82]There has to be a purpose of what you're doing there.
[98:52.55]The donuts?
[98:53.11]Just walk across the donuts?
[98:54.27]Do I bounce on the donuts?
[98:55.33]I've never seen the donuts before.
[98:59.73]What the fuck was that?!
[99:01.11]It's lots of slipperiness there!
[99:14.52]Does this count?
[99:15.20]If I go through this, am I gonna land on something?
[99:22.16]Oh shit.
[99:23.86]Um... Do I have to direct him?
[99:29.93]Over here?
[99:40.66]I don't... Dude, I don't carry both the coins.
[99:56.32]I almost just pressed jump.
[100:12.87]Mario time!
[100:13.59]That was kind of hard, but not really.
[100:30.94]It does both at the same time.
[100:35.86]Mental breakdown?
[100:36.68]No.
[100:38.00]Not yet.
[100:40.14]What else we got for jobs?
[100:41.00]We got fire koopa clown carnage.
[100:43.56]Uh, yeah.
[100:50.20]Ask again in a few hours?
[100:54.47]Yeah.
[100:55.03]Ask again in a few hours.
[100:57.44]We'll see if I can be the first person on Twitch to complete this.
[101:00.06]The game's been out for like 12 hours.
[101:05.86]I don't think that's gonna be a thing.
[101:15.51]I can jump again.
[101:16.17]What am I doing?
[101:16.59]It's so burnt in my brain that I can't jump.
[101:36.49]He's been conditioned.
[101:37.55]At this point, yes.
[101:38.17]Spread out.
[101:39.08]Oops.
[101:39.22]Should I not kill these?
[101:40.50]I wonder if I should jump on them.
[102:11.02]They don't have a chance?
[102:11.76]Yeah, they shouldn't.
[102:14.44]Oh, what does this do?
[102:17.90]Can I bump?
[102:20.67]Oh, it's like an extra health bar, right?
[102:22.85]Yeah, it's one extra hit.
[102:40.44]That thing comes off.
[102:41.22]Yeah, like that.
[102:42.24]Like that.
[102:44.62]Good thing I had a hard head.
[102:45.46]Get them all.
[102:45.86]Get the one up too.
[102:47.27]I'll take it.
[102:47.71]This... That's dumb luck that I haven't been hit yet.
[103:17.49]How fast does he go up?
[103:20.73]Look at this shit, the Battletoads.
[103:22.39]No!
[103:22.49]Alright, hold on, slow down, slow down, slow, slow, slow.
[103:26.43]Oh, fuck.
[103:50.89]Watch out for that really slow moving arrow.
[103:57.09]Just get out and get it!
[103:58.05]Oh shit, hold on, is it still there?
[104:09.92]Go back, go back, go back.
[104:24.65]Need that spike helmet?
[104:25.53]Yeah, that's true.
[104:26.84]That's true.
[104:35.86]Double.
[104:37.08]One more job, and then we'll be at probably what?
[104:39.54]Somebody up there?
[104:41.40]Oh, I can go in the castle.
[104:51.87]What's going on up here?
[104:52.81]This is a regular toad.
[104:55.21]I need your help.
[104:57.46]It'll be bad if the chief overhears.
[104:59.68]A mutiny?
[105:02.08]Heavy stone heave ho.
[105:06.14]We went off a budget and ran out of stone for making stairs.
[105:09.62]And of course the chief says, we only use stone from the desert.
[105:13.48]I'll do it myself, but it's so heavy.
[105:15.50]Could you bring me some?
[105:16.96]Reach the gall well holding a stone.
[105:21.89]Let's go.
[105:26.13]Oh, Mario cake.
[105:29.90]It's my favorite Mario.
[105:32.96]I gotta hold the stone the whole time.
[105:34.52]Whatever happens if I let it go.
[105:35.44]I have to hold down this button the whole time, which I get really sweaty, greasy hands.
[105:40.39]So this is gonna be hard to do.
[105:53.46]Can I jump up here?
[105:55.56]Oh fuck, I could've got it.
[106:25.99]I want that.
[106:30.73]How do I get that, though?
[106:39.88]Okay, well that was easier than I thought it was going to be.
[106:44.80]You can put the stone down.
[106:46.64]How do you know that?
[106:52.37]I thought I'd... Wait, I just had to... It's a Left 4 Dead Gnome run.
[106:55.53]Only 17 coins!
[106:59.78]You didn't try?
[107:00.38]I didn't want to lose any... an extra life.
[107:02.76]I need those.
[107:03.34]Okay, so what was the... Oh, that's it.
[107:10.32]Let's go.
[107:10.66]25%? 30%?
[107:22.65]26.
[107:22.73]Hmm.
[107:24.89]More workers.
[107:28.16]Mario, we need some blocks to get to the East Hall from here, but... Psst, Mario.
[107:32.88]Can you keep a secret?
[107:35.06]Thanks.
[107:35.76]And good luck.
[107:37.76]What was the secret?
[107:40.91]That's the secret.
[107:44.45]Purple Toad, who makes the blocks, hasn't arrived yet.
[107:48.16]Got the schedule wrong.
[107:49.38]Management, am I right?
[107:50.99]Anyway, please bring the purple toad back here.
[107:53.23]Reach the goal with one toad in tow.
[107:55.53]What do you mean, in... What do you mean, toad in tow?
[108:08.63]Where do I get this toad?
[108:17.38]I just realized something.
[108:19.50]All these mushrooms, you know, because before it was just, there was just the one toad.
[108:23.94]Now there's a shitload of toads.
[108:26.08]There's toads everywhere.
[108:28.61]Take a look at what the mushrooms in this game look like.
[108:31.97]They look exactly like Toad's head.
[108:38.65]Think about that.
[108:41.13]And we've come to learn that there are hundreds, if not, like, millions of toads.
[108:45.74]Where'd the mushrooms come from?
[108:54.90]Look at them.
[109:01.27]Look at this loser's face, and look at that toad face.
[109:06.71]Look at the mushroom.
[109:11.47]Somebody get the... with those theorists on the line.
[109:19.22]I can actually jump on top of them.
[109:27.16]Risky move.
[109:27.69]Risky play.
[109:28.95]Oh shit.
[109:33.03]Risky move here.
[109:39.15]Come on.
[109:40.33]Shoot one more.
[109:40.93]Not gonna shoot another one.
[109:44.52]Hello.
[109:46.34]Right at the bottom.
[109:47.10]Bun coin.
[109:50.00]Why is Yoshi born with shoes on?
[109:54.84]That is kind of weird.
[109:55.70]I'm gonna have dreams about this shit.
[110:12.78]How many more though?
[110:13.28]I have to do that like three or four more times?
[110:22.39]Well, anything else you need me to do over here on the rampart?
[110:25.89]Okay.
[110:31.29]You didn't hear me say that.
[110:32.49]Oh, I'm ready to start working the rest of the East Hall.
[110:35.15]Oh.
[110:35.91]You have to... I see.
[110:42.05]Hello, you.
[110:42.57]We're gonna find a new toad.
[110:46.07]The chief took my cloud because she said she needed it for something or other.
[110:50.21]I don't want the chief to hear this, so let me just whisper it in your ear.
[110:55.15]The chief asked me to get a Lakitu's cloud for the West Hall.
[110:58.12]Can you believe that?
[110:59.80]Who asks someone to do something that they don't want to do themselves?
[111:03.10]Oh, hey, can you go and get me a Lakitu's cloud, Mario?
[111:06.38]Comedy.
[111:12.55]I can't wait for, like, the Glassdoor reviews of rebuilding the Magic Kingdom.
[111:18.90]Whatever this is.
[111:19.42]Oh, I got, like, how much time do I have?
[111:25.00]Not very much time at all.
[111:27.62]I have 12 seconds.
[111:41.17]Four!
[111:43.65]There's a four up there!
[111:45.87]But I had four seconds left!
[111:49.86]What?!
[111:50.28]Get outta here!
[112:06.29]I had four seconds left!
[112:09.05]Oh my god!
[112:13.12]The cloud has its own timer, so what's the extra three seconds for on the clock?
[112:16.86]Why not just make it twelve seconds?
[112:20.06]Or sixteen seconds?
[112:35.34]Okay, I made it over.
[112:37.56]Alright, whatever.
[112:44.43]That was so sloppy.
[112:46.09]Oh, god damn it!
[112:47.77]It's okay.
[112:48.67]I...
[113:04.11]I kind of want to call Luigi.
[113:05.61]I want to know what it does.
[113:07.28]I'm not calling him yet.
[113:18.04]It's really slippery in the cloud.
[113:26.39]Oh my god, I can't fucking do this.
[113:31.53]I was being so careful.
[113:40.15]Oh.
[113:42.44]Ugh.
[113:43.06]Alright, just... It's not even that big of a deal.
[113:45.44]I'm just freaking out for no reason.
[113:49.06]Nobody can do anything with this music on.
[113:50.72]They should make relaxing music here.
[113:54.44]Like calm down music.
[113:56.90]Imagine if your boss was fucking yelling at you to finish doing something.
[114:00.74]Uh, you screwed that whole... You screwed that whole, uh, thing up.
[114:08.75]Jacob.
[114:11.76]You missed like two lines there.
[114:12.98]You gotta go back and fix it.
[114:15.10]You gotta go back and fix it right now.
[114:17.84]Jacob, fix it now.
[114:20.19]Okay, which line?
[114:21.29]The line, two lines down.
[114:23.27]It should say they and plus six.
[114:27.29]Hurry the fuck up, Jacob.
[114:38.54]You had bad grammar.
[114:42.91]There was an extra tea!
[114:44.35]No, I can't... Oh yeah!
[115:06.25]Oh, hey, I know that you're, uh, clocking out of work here in, like, the next 30 seconds or so.
[115:11.36]Uh, but, can you make, make, we need six more hamburgers made right now, go!
[115:24.39]I'm gonna get it right now.
[115:53.86]Oh my god, it's so floaty.
[116:19.14]Thank you
[116:50.40]I don't want to watch this every time.
[116:51.62]Just let me jump on it.
[116:54.47]God, Nintendo.
[116:55.25]Come on.
[117:03.59]The chief took my cloud.
[117:04.57]Can't believe it.
[117:05.19]Don't tell the chief I said that.
[117:06.91]LOL.
[117:08.80]I'm ready.
[117:09.12]26%.
[117:10.20]Building the whole damn castle today.
[117:12.38]Did you hear?
[117:14.40]What?
[117:14.64]What?
[117:14.90]I'm sorry.
[117:16.10]I had static.
[117:16.74]There was a little bit of frame drop there.
[117:18.06]What did you say, Jeremy?
[117:19.86]Building the whole castle tonight.
[117:30.68]Snake blocks in the sky.
[117:34.88]This is a 40 hour long campaign.
[117:36.58]Woohoo!
[117:39.35]Is it?
[117:40.47]No, it's not.
[117:45.76]Is it?
[117:46.24]It's not actually a 40-hour campaign.
[117:52.60]I'm already like 30% of the way done.
[117:53.82]It's been two hours.
[117:57.85]Two, four, six, eight.
[117:59.57]I'll do this in like six and a half to eight hours.
[118:03.85]I need to practice to be able to do the multiplayer levels.
[118:05.85]You think this is the last Mario Maker 2 stream?
[118:18.46]Yes, we think so.
[118:21.20]I don't know, it might be.
[118:24.35]I messed up.
[118:26.61]How do I get that?
[118:39.03]I think I missed my opportunity to get it.
[118:40.65]No I didn't, hold on.
[118:41.97]It's alright!
[118:52.00]I do have a terrible record with Mario games, yeah.
[118:56.18]But correct me if I'm wrong, as of two hours into the stream, last Mario Maker stream, I was already talking about... I was talking about problems with the controller.
[119:07.61]So I got input lag, right?
[119:09.21]And then it was already like a huge problem.
[119:12.63]Remember?
[119:13.31]I remember that.
[119:16.37]That shit was on the Wii U.
[119:21.84]The Wii U's controller.
[119:22.92]I was on, like, the big brick controller.
[119:25.40]I don't think I even had the... Yeah, I... No, that's one of the reasons why.
[119:38.80]And it was all stained and shit.
[119:40.08]Well, I think I blew that opportunity.
[119:41.64]Do I have to ride this?
[119:42.99]Wow, you can ride it?
[119:50.94]Don't crush my head!
[119:51.70]Cool.
[119:52.30]This is fucking radical.
[119:53.54]Oh, I thought I was gonna... I thought I was gonna just shrink.
[120:20.81]I don't like this shit either.
[120:21.57]It's like you're meant to get called into your boss's office in this place.
[120:23.87]You're fired.
[120:24.35]That just... That just murdered me.
[120:25.54]That double-tapped me, I think.
[120:26.72]Get out of here.
[120:27.58]I don't need you.
[121:02.39]I can do that?
[121:04.09]Why can I do that?
[121:05.89]I don't understand what the purpose of that is quite, at the moment.
[121:09.01]Coins, coins, coins.
[121:09.91]Okay.
[121:10.19]What's that for?
[121:35.84]Watch out for the... Okay, there it is.
[121:37.58]I can't see.
[121:38.34]Don't go forward.
[121:39.69]What?
[121:39.85]That was gritty.
[121:40.41]Alright, just a flag.
[121:41.55]Should I just... Wait.
[121:42.21]There's a pipe here.
[122:05.72]Oh, right.
[122:10.27]But wait, I can go down.
[122:11.35]Oh!
[122:25.28]That was... I don't know... That was a weird cough.
[122:30.65]I wanted to say something, but I had nothing to say, so that was my body's instinctual response.
[122:34.57]It was just a cough.
[122:35.89]Did I die or he die?
[122:36.93]I think he did, yeah.
[123:06.22]How much money do I got?
[123:06.80]A thousand?
[123:09.32]I think I can do some other builds here.
[123:13.84]What do you got for me?
[123:15.69]Making great progress.
[123:16.51]This design is too perfect.
[123:17.37]Almost too perfect.
[123:18.99]We have a new building option.
[123:22.59]Let's go with West Hall, second floor.
[123:26.89]I am certain.
[123:37.45]Construction is underway.
[123:40.17]How big is this castle?
[123:42.53]Square footage wise.
[123:43.26]Have they ever released that information?
[123:47.50]Can you look up the Mario castle on Zillow?
[123:50.82]Now that would be a cute idea, wouldn't you think so?
[123:54.76]Imagine like Zillow or one of these other places did a little thing.
[124:02.96]This is not a good idea at all.
[124:04.37]No one would use this.
[124:04.99]It would be stupid.
[124:06.43]Never mind.
[124:10.78]Twister?
[124:12.50]If you press B as you enter the twister, you'll be thrown skywards.
[124:14.99]Yeah, I know.
[124:16.49]Twisting through the desert sands.
[124:19.59]It could be a cute April Fool's gag.
[124:24.65]Yeah, I mean, maybe.
[124:27.41]You can scroll through photos of inside the castle.
[124:29.90]It'll tell you how many square footage it is.
[124:31.68]And then you get to the price and you go, Mario, how the fuck can you afford that?
[124:44.20]And then you check the Zestimate.
[124:46.56]Find out what your mortgage estimate would be for Peach's castle.
[124:53.34]Oh.
[124:53.50]$61,000 a month Zestimate.
[124:55.50]I can't.
[124:55.80]I don't think I can live there.
[125:10.75]That's it?
[125:15.27]Got it.
[125:16.73]Jeez.
[125:17.85]Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[125:28.19]Alright, B. B. Oh my god, what are you doing?
[125:52.66]Say the line.
[125:53.36]What line?
[125:56.40]Cake Mario?
[125:58.56]Wait.
[125:59.93]Do I weigh enough to get this?
[126:16.90]I have to wait until it goes all the way to the side.
[127:08.81]Not bad.
[127:14.04]107 coins so far.
[127:14.64]I'm running out of time, though.
[127:17.32]That felt pretty damn good.
[127:32.58]Alright, what's it cost for the other ones?
[127:36.13]What's that thing over there?
[127:42.79]There's a number muncher over there.
[127:46.48]Quiet.
[127:49.00]Hey, kid.
[127:50.28]Looks like you've been hard at work.
[127:52.96]I suppose it's time I get back to work myself.
[127:55.60]Adios.
[127:59.23]Mr. Eraser.
[128:05.25]Sorry, I'm gonna go chew on some prime numbers.
[128:08.69]I'll be back in a few hours.
[128:19.17]Come on, that was cute.
[128:20.51]That was cute.
[128:21.09]That was cute.
[128:24.27]The room was split on that one.
[128:33.65]The way of the shell.
[128:34.68]Oh, it was a begone rotten mushroom.
[128:36.96]I bought some mushrooms for a new recipe, but I left them in the car and now they're rotten.
[128:43.56]Rotten and vengeful.
[128:44.78]You're going to have to outrun them if you want the reward.
[128:54.38]Begone rotten mushroom.
[128:57.58]Outrun the mushrooms.
[129:01.77]This is a pretty awesome Halloween level.
[129:10.45]I did the joke before too, hold on.
[129:12.09]Let me do the same joke that I've done already like a thousand times.
[129:16.13]Get out of my way for a second.
[129:48.52]I'm mocking him.
[129:54.51]Whoa!
[129:54.91]He can do that!
[129:55.45]He can't climb, right?
[129:59.75]No.
[130:01.51]Can I block him down here?
[130:16.04]No, wait.
[130:43.24]Holy shit, don't do that far.
[130:46.39]You blew everything!
[130:47.85]You're making this... What?
[130:50.33]Cool.
[131:13.70]How much money?
[131:14.90]674.
[131:18.68]Need more coins.
[131:21.74]Where are we at?
[131:22.32]Did I do all of them?
[131:22.94]Hold on.
[131:23.38]I got a lot to do down here.
[131:24.42]Bonsai built ambush.
[131:32.08]Guahaha, I've got an army of bonsai bills guarding this place.
[131:35.22]Hoping they'll surprise Mario by sneaking up behind him.
[131:37.70]Any of you chumps out there desperate enough to test it before Mario shows up?
[131:42.02]Get to the end and get paid.
[131:46.26]Good luck out there.
[131:48.74]Go talk to the dog?
[131:49.48]I will after I get another thousand dollars.
[131:55.44]Talk to the dog or I'm unsubbing.
[131:59.30]Just hold on.
[132:05.13]Cat.
[132:09.81]I like the, uh, bullets in this.
[132:14.91]They're pretty cool.
[132:17.25]I think they come from the background.
[132:19.29]It's a nice touch.
[132:21.73]Who made this?
[132:22.33]I did.
[132:22.65]Oh, okay, cool.
[132:23.73]I didn't know there was a death here.
[132:28.84]What was going through your thought process?
[132:36.88]What the fuck just happened?
[132:38.58]Oh.
[132:38.78]Didn't have the checkpoint.
[132:52.56]I didn't press up.
[132:53.76]Wait a minute, I can turn it around?
[132:56.81]Let's see.
[133:08.36]Just let him destroy everything.
[133:11.20]Not quite.
[133:11.90]Oh, well.
[133:18.77]Missed coins.
[133:19.43]He missed coins.
[133:20.31]I don't... It's alright.
[133:27.04]I have to jump on one of their heads to get this.
[133:28.82]Get that guy down.
[133:31.82]I gotta get on the cloud.
[133:32.76]Will the cloud fall?
[133:35.82]No.
[133:35.90]Wait, what if I just do this?
[133:39.52]That works?
[133:41.59]Seems kind of out of place.
[134:03.37]fursuit.
[134:04.99]Guys, Mario has been wearing fursuits for 25 years.
[134:09.42]This ain't new.
[134:19.96]Seesaw catapults.
[134:23.75]Jump and tilt down to do a ground pound onto a seesaw to send anything on the other end flying.
[134:36.62]I love little cute Mario.
[134:40.10]What a perfect thing to have on a keychain.
[134:43.16]Don't you think so?
[134:47.39]Or Cake Mario.
[134:48.17]I think Cake Mario is what I would put on a keychain.
[134:53.03]They definitely have it.
[134:53.71]I can ground pound this, but why would I ground pound any of this crap?
[135:18.49]What?
[135:20.67]What's up with that?
[135:27.25]I just, like, was... I just, like, broke his neck.
[135:29.59]I can't, like, sever his head?
[135:30.92]Like, I can't break his neck right there?
[135:32.28]Yeah, right.
[135:33.50]Okay.
[135:46.04]I always thought that you couldn't kill that thing, but it just got angry.
[135:48.60]I'm gonna break that.
[135:51.38]I'm gonna... The thing is... Let's see if I can get that.
[135:56.54]Okay, hold on.
[136:03.44]Nah, not quite.
[136:04.86]Shit, alright.
[136:11.24]I gotta shut the fuck up.
[136:16.62]Wait, can I skip that?
[136:18.20]He's gonna keep squiggling around in there.
[136:24.82]Okay.
[136:30.33]There's probably a coin over there.
[136:31.95]I'm gonna just give it a look.
[136:35.25]See, he does get mad.
[136:35.81]Whatever.
[136:52.52]It is right here, it's fine.
[136:58.97]Whatever, it's 10 coins.
[137:00.19]That's nothing.
[137:02.15]I thought I said I could launch him!
[137:07.17]Wait, can I do it?
[137:07.67]I can do it from the bottom.
[137:20.94]Yeah, see?
[137:22.76]I'm not sure what that even did for me, but... I gotta get it.
[137:25.72]You're right.
[137:26.02]I'm looking in the chat right now.
[137:28.04]People are just like, you fucking idiot.
[137:30.78]Stupid.
[137:31.16]Like, how dare you miss that?
[137:32.22]And I'm like, jeez.
[137:33.65]I mean, it's just Mario.
[137:40.71]It's just Mario, guys.
[137:41.85]Calm down.
[137:44.39]Somebody said I hate you in all capitals, like, ten times in a row.
[137:47.72]It's just like... Relax.
[137:49.98]It's alright.
[137:50.62]It's gonna be okay.
[137:53.84]Jest Mario?
[137:59.97]JEST Mario?! !
[138:17.89]Ooh, now that was fun.
[138:25.63]Shit.
[138:26.83]What am I- how do I do that?
[138:27.79]Gotta go from here, to there, to there- WHAT?!
[138:40.23]It's the buttons!
[138:41.17]The button!
[138:41.83]I fat-fingered!
[138:42.93]Cause I'm using the Nintendo Switch!
[138:46.19]My thumb!
[138:48.51]Using my th- Luigi, get out of my face.
[138:53.64]The switch- I'm using the switch controller, and sometimes when you press one button on the switch, you press all of them.
[138:59.86]Because they're like sprinkles on your controller.
[139:05.28]It's like having chocolate chips on your controller.
[139:16.75]Sorry, I pressed all the chocolate chips at the same time.
[139:19.95]I don't even have big hands.
[139:26.90]Yeah, I kind of do, but not that big.
[139:46.81]What if I bl- if I fuck this up again?
[139:54.33]What's underneath this?
[140:07.03]Sorry I pressed every single little, like, dinner mint at the same time.
[140:14.94]Remember those candy dots that were on the sheet of paper?
[140:18.18]Those are bigger than the switch buttons.
[140:40.16]Dog, dog.
[140:40.86]Alright, alright, alright.
[140:41.78]I'll talk to the dog.
[140:44.95]Bark, bark, I have jobs.
[140:46.43]Woof.
[140:47.67]Woof, woof.
[140:48.37]Come on, please.
[140:49.25]Ooh, there's a dog level.
[140:51.75]Swinging Claw, escape.
[140:55.19]Arf, Arf, I have a job for you to do.
[140:56.65]I keep getting caught by the swinging claws hanging around my walking route.
[141:00.95]Could you show me a path I can take to avoid getting grabbed?
[141:06.09]Reach the goal without using any swinging claws.
[141:09.58]Who's a good boy?
[141:21.74]What the fuck is that?
[141:25.58]That just freaked me the fuck out when I looked over there.
[141:30.40]Alright, don't get grabbed by any of these.
[141:32.68]I can jump though, right?
[141:40.23]Just let that happen.
[141:42.49]Don't get grabbed.
[141:55.61]dun dun dun
[142:25.26]Don't get grabbed.
[142:27.00]Slide!
[142:28.34]Wait.
[142:29.38]Okay, now slide.
[142:41.07]Sure.
[142:43.85]Okay, that's fine.
[142:50.17]It is a dog level, so it makes sense.
[142:52.07]I did the same thing again.
[142:53.69]I just let it happen again.
[142:59.18]Like, sometimes I think if you, like, split my head open, there'd be watermelon juice in there.
[143:07.72]Like, sometimes I think it's just a coconut.
[143:16.25]Oh!
[143:17.23]That was probably... That was so loud.
[143:18.81]I can tell.
[143:19.17]I looked over at the monitor and it was really loud.
[143:28.93]Okay, I'm safe here, I think.
[143:37.19]Where is the other ones?
[143:40.04]There's gonna be another one.
[143:49.45]See, the thing is, there was no point in me doing what I was just trying to do.
[143:55.68]There was no point in that.
[143:57.14]I just had to go up.
[143:58.26]I don't know... Don't do it again.
[144:08.63]If this happens again, I truly have... Like, orange juice in my brain.
[144:15.35]Remember those old Gushers commercials?
[144:19.64]They would eat the Gushers and their heads would turn into, like, pears and shit?
[144:22.48]Don't get grabbed.
[144:39.30]Just kill me Start over button.
[144:52.32]Yeah, I have to go down with the ship though
[145:21.00]It's literally five coins.
[145:23.40]Do I really care that much about it?
[145:30.25]Don't even start talking shit about the Jell-O.
[145:32.79]Somebody said Jell-O and I got immediately angry.
[145:36.35]Hold on.
[145:37.19]No, I'm not talking about Jell-O anymore.
[145:43.53]Jello is jello.
[145:44.77]Jello is jelly.
[145:46.53]I can't even fucking believe it.
[145:47.94]I'm already getting heated.
[145:49.46]I'm already getting like, I can feel my blood.
[145:52.90]Don't do that.
[145:53.92]Just get the thing.
[146:03.34]Jelly is jello.
[146:04.86]Give me a break.
[146:07.09]Jelly is not always made with gelatin.
[146:09.87]I can't even... I'm already getting mad.
[146:12.21]I can stop.
[146:12.75]Stop!
[146:13.03]Stop!
[146:13.29]Just play!
[146:13.77]Stop.
[146:23.85]You think I'm gonna go for two coins?
[146:34.59]They've respawned.
[146:37.92]Okay, wait.
[146:38.40]Go now.
[146:40.74]Drop it.
[146:44.39]Oh, shit.
[146:45.87]Home stretch.
[146:46.33]Don't blow it.
[146:48.55]I don't care if I didn't touch it.
[146:56.18]Jelly is bones.
[146:57.04]No, jello is always made with gelatin.
[146:59.88]Jelly is not always made with gelatin.
[147:03.22]Sometimes it's fruit preserves.
[147:04.36]So therefore, chat was I-N-C-O-R-R-E-C-T.
[147:20.07]Another job for the dog?
[147:20.93]Sure.
[147:28.42]When was the last time you guys tried to spread jello on a piece of toast?
[147:33.77]Really?
[147:35.63]You can't... That's not going to happen.
[147:44.41]Arf, arf, I have a job for you.
[147:45.71]The nights have been so cold lately.
[147:47.85]Could you bring me something that will shelter me from the storm?
[147:50.75]Reach the goal while wearing a dry bone shell.
[147:56.50]Big tickle!
[148:03.43]If you spread jello on your toast... What?
[148:08.79]Hold on.
[148:20.46]What the fuck?
[148:21.65]I didn't even get a chance!
[148:27.77]I can't see where we're going.
[148:29.11]Oh, thank god there's arrows.
[148:44.30]Oh boy.
[148:45.22]Okay.
[148:46.40]I think we're safe.
[148:47.53]Can I jump on these?
[148:48.97]Yes, I can.
[148:50.25]Yes, I can.
[148:53.47]No, you can't.
[148:53.97]Yes, I can.
[148:55.83]You can't.
[148:56.63]Yes, I can.
[148:57.46]Did you just watch?
[148:58.26]God.
[148:59.50]What the fuck?
[149:13.06]I'm going to get it.
[149:16.88]Get in the shell.
[149:18.46]Get in the shell.
[149:19.48]What the hell?
[149:21.42]How is it even possible?
[149:22.52]Oh, yeah.
[149:29.79]Oh, yeah.
[149:40.06]It's this purple jello.
[149:43.18]Don't say that anymore.
[149:44.14]Does he have a glass break?
[150:00.02]I'm cutting this way too close.
[150:05.69]Like, honestly, I don't care.
[150:08.25]I don't need to think about this.
[150:09.45]I don't care about the world's most disgusting snack.
[150:13.37]Who cares?
[150:14.85]Jell-O, jelly, who cares?
[150:16.39]It doesn't matter.
[150:18.11]It doesn't matter.
[150:19.51]Who cares?
[150:19.87]Got it.
[150:34.79]Oh, fuck.
[150:37.61]um should I go oh I got it imagine being Mario right now what a nightmare
[151:15.62]87 coins.
[151:15.86]Cool.
[151:16.86]I got enough money now.
[151:17.60]Is that it for the dog?
[151:21.28]Ooh.
[151:22.50]I got him a doghouse.
[151:25.83]He's got more.
[151:26.47]Should I just do all the dog missions?
[151:28.13]No, we gotta start a build here.
[151:36.15]Looking glorious.
[151:37.90]We have new building options now.
[151:39.14]Cool.
[151:40.99]West Hall Cannon.
[151:42.27]Main Hall 3.
[151:43.91]Main Hall 3.

[151:55.10]Do auto-missions.
[151:58.02]I will.
[151:58.68]I'll do it right now.
[152:04.43]Got another job.
[152:07.45]This is a full-on...
[152:10.29]Four star difficult.
[152:11.33]First time we've seen it.
[152:12.33]Tonight.
[152:13.23]Chain chomp chiller.
[152:14.39]And I get something.
[152:15.11]What do I get?
[152:15.53]A mystery t-shirt.
[152:20.05]The path I usually take is littered with chain chomps.
[152:22.10]Could you show me if it's possible to walk through there without jumping?
[152:29.34]Can't wait.
[152:35.94]Get Luigi on speed dial for this one.
[152:45.98]I did it.
[152:51.53]No.
[152:54.01]This is gonna suck.
[152:58.55]What?
[152:58.77]Wait.
[152:58.99]Does this one fly?
[153:00.51]Some of them don't.
[153:00.99]Some of them go fly forward.
[153:03.21]Okay.
[153:14.00]Oh, no.
[153:15.78]No!
[153:16.72]How am I gonna?
[153:17.42]Okay.
[153:20.98]Just get me to a flag.
[153:36.50]I don't know.
[153:37.02]I don't know when to go.
[153:37.96]Right now.
[153:38.26]Okay, hold on.
[153:44.81]Is he gonna go up?
[153:47.21]Did I put this down?
[153:47.77]Should I put this down?
[153:48.31]I'm gonna put it down.
[153:48.81]Should I bring it with me?
[153:51.94]I'm gonna bring it with me.
[153:54.88]Might need it.
[153:56.84]I'm gonna make him jump up there.
[153:57.82]I'm gonna bring it with me.
[154:04.60]How is that four stars and the other one was three that one was harder than that it was like two
[154:31.93]I got the reset dress.
[154:37.75]I want it.
[154:38.67]You can equip the outfit in the course world.
[154:41.97]Alright.
[154:50.18]Is that it for the dog?
[154:51.18]I got the dog's shirt.
[154:55.02]Need some more coins.
[154:55.56]Get some jobs over here.
[155:01.27]Let me get through these.
[155:03.92]Tunnel to the dark side of the moon.
[155:06.74]I think I tunnel all the way to the other side of the moon because everything is upside down there.
[155:09.48]It's pretty neat, but kind of disorienting.
[155:12.62]If you want to slide down a slope, you've got to hit up.
[155:20.35]I really didn't think that I was going to have this much fun in the random build the castle single player.
[155:26.67]But I kind of am.
[155:30.82]Hmm.
[155:37.00]Wait.
[155:37.70]Can I respawn you?
[155:39.30]Yes.
[155:39.62]Can I bounce you off the wall?
[155:47.48]Oh my god.
[155:52.60]I didn't mean to do that.
[155:59.55]I turned the wrong way.
[156:09.01]Okay, I'm gonna bounce him off the wall.
[156:12.07]Just get in the fucking pipe.
[156:17.67]Oh.
[156:20.69]Well, now that makes more sense.
[156:26.03]Upside down.
[156:26.85]Now wait, check the other thing.
[156:37.04]That's a death, isn't it?
[156:38.22]Shit.
[156:39.26]At least I know I don't have to do that.
[156:50.93]Just go in, grab, turn, run, jump.
[156:56.15]Nice.
[157:02.00]Alright.
[157:11.19]Is there a point to that?
[157:12.07]Anything over here?
[157:15.95]I don't think there's anything over there.
[157:25.65]Slide?
[157:27.16]I can't slide as Cake Mario.
[157:30.22]At least not upside down.
[157:31.02]Oh shit, I thought I was going to go through.
[157:37.58]Oh boy, watch out!
[157:42.13]I can't get up there.
[157:47.93]I can get up there now, right?
[157:57.15]Yeah.
[157:57.49]What's even up here?
[158:09.00]Just flip the switch upside down.
[158:15.85]I mean, you could do that.
[158:17.97]Maybe.
[158:19.01]Jerma nuke the chat.
[158:27.67]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[158:33.37]Hey, hey.
[158:53.97]Alright Okay, that was as if like a toddler was like walking towards the stove And like reaching up to the stove
[159:21.22]Alright, be careful, careful, careful.
[159:22.62]I can't kill the spike head.
[159:27.57]I feel like if I jump too high, it's going to kill me off screen.
[159:34.41]Is that going to happen?
[159:37.17]No, but I can fall off here though, right?
[159:39.74]Will that happen if I fall off here?
[159:41.04]I think so.
[159:43.02]Just careful.
[159:44.56]Oh my god, that's going to happen if I do that.
[159:46.08]Can I get in this door?
[159:52.07]I just pressed down.
[159:56.56]Don't go that far.
[159:58.78]I can get it twice, can't I?
[160:09.16]No, I can't.
[160:12.79]No, that's not going to get me.
[160:21.77]Super Mario.
[160:22.57]Super Mario.
[160:23.36]Super Mario.
[160:24.98]We've got a game of the year contender here.
[160:33.51]I just pressed a button on my, like, OBS.
[160:35.45]Am I still streaming?
[160:43.38]I think, yeah, I am.
[160:45.10]I, like, pressed my key, I, like, mashed, like, a couple buttons on the keyboard.
[160:48.85]Stop streaming is highlighted, though.
[160:51.65]So, I'm kind of, I'm just gonna move my mouse to the other monitor.
[160:54.63]Alright, so that's all these, right?
[161:06.67]All the way up through 21.
[161:07.40]This one's an easy one.
[161:11.02]I like easy ones.
[161:15.11]Am I going to do a Jerma Game Awards at the end of the year?
[161:21.52]Probably not.
[161:21.98]I don't really do that anymore.
[161:23.22]Not since the YouTube days.
[161:25.90]And even when I did it on YouTube.
[161:27.50]It was kind of a joke anyways.
[161:30.13]I usually just tell you... I had to obey.
[161:34.61]I'm sorry.
[161:35.17]Because I was sinking, guys.
[161:41.71]He's gonna jump, eventually.
[161:44.10]Oh!
[161:44.32]Don't!
[162:10.23]This is why I need Yoshi.
[162:12.17]Can I go get him again?
[162:12.83]I want that coin.
[162:14.71]That motherfucker is drowning down there.
[162:18.30]Come here, Yoshi.
[162:19.90]Where are you?
[162:20.28]Yoshi.
[162:44.16]Come on, hurry up.
[162:50.88]That's my opinion on Anthony Bantley for 2020.
[162:53.63]We don't talk politics on this stream.
[162:56.31]But that candidate sucks.
[163:04.57]I just killed the thing that I wanted to come all the way back here to respawn.
[163:06.90]I don't even care.
[163:09.30]Just go in there.
[163:13.81]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[163:15.34]If you have a shell, you swim better.
[163:18.54]There he is!
[163:43.74]Hold on, should I do it again?
[163:45.45]Should I?
[163:46.03]Should I do it again?
[163:47.31]Should I?
[163:47.99]Wait, do you think I should do it?
[163:49.83]I'm not a monster, I thought there was something up there.
[164:15.94]Some people said it's a 40 hour single player campaign.
[164:18.94]I don't think that you were correct.
[164:21.14]I think you may have been just a slight bit incorrect.
[164:31.52]Above the clouds, beyond the vines.
[164:35.04]Vines growing all over it.
[164:36.14]Be my guest.
[164:49.81]40 hour campaign, the game's been up for like 18 hours.
[164:52.07]Yeah, how would you even know that?
[164:54.15]Unless, like, the press told you that.
[165:02.59]Wait.
[165:04.78]I gotta go from keychain Mario to, like, grown-up Mario.
[165:07.20]There we go.
[165:21.24]Which side?
[165:30.23]40 hours of journalist difficulty?
[165:35.65]Yeah?
[165:37.64]What were you gonna say?
[165:46.20]Tell me again?
[165:46.74]What was it?
[165:50.35]Of journalist difficulty is what you said?
[165:52.33]I almost just did it.
[165:58.18]I don't know why I just freaked out there.
[166:11.45]It was just happening.
[166:33.76]I love that like... It's kind of like the way.
[166:40.19]What is... What am I doing?
[166:43.81]What the fuck happened?
[166:45.61]Can they go sideways?
[166:46.55]That's what it is.
[166:47.13]I didn't think they could go sideways.
[166:48.71]They've evolved.
[166:50.10]They never used to be able to do this shit.
[166:54.65]Nooooooo!
[166:55.97]It's alright, we can get that.
[167:10.46]Luigi, you would've died to that too.
[167:14.40]That would laugh my ass off, if there was a problem with the game or something, it was a bug.
[167:20.14]And Luigi got fucking smoked in the first ten seconds.
[167:32.19]Luigi's gonna call somebody else.
[167:36.04]Wario gets on the phone.
[167:48.07]This game is a bullshit!
[168:07.24]This goddamn candy controller, I swear to God.
[168:11.48]I could probably eat one of the Switch controllers and be fine.
[168:13.96]I really think that.
[168:15.50]I could eat it.
[168:16.84]And it would just... I'd be fine.
[168:18.22]Where am I?
[168:21.84]In the cloud.
[168:40.18]This is gonna be risky.
[168:40.88]Risky play!
[168:43.30]What was that?!
[168:47.08]What?!
[168:48.58]Why did he magnetize the other direction?!
[169:01.49]I think I'm safe.
[169:02.65]You're never safe, though.
[169:03.73]Hold on.
[169:09.34]What is that?
[169:09.94]I can skip the whole level?
[169:12.08]Did I just put that out of reach?
[169:20.81]No, I didn't.
[169:21.23]What the hell is the point of this?
[169:41.61]Dev exit.
[169:52.78]Listen.
[169:53.96]I... I forgot.
[169:57.32]Mario.
[169:58.64]In all the Mario games, if you go over the flag, it just stops you and you're at the top of the flag.
[170:06.48]Not in this one.
[170:11.65]What do you mean not true?
[170:15.36]That's true.
[170:16.60]If you go over the flag in the original Mario game, you... No, that's right.
[170:21.52]That happens in like the first two or three of them that do that.
[170:24.80]That happens.
[170:32.42]That happens.
[170:36.28]What do I think about chocolate pudding?
[170:37.48]It has bones in it.
[170:39.66]Chocolate pudding is fine.
[170:41.48]But chocolate pudding is not jello.
[170:42.84]I mean, it could be.
[170:45.48]It could be chocolate jello.
[170:49.09]Chocolate pudding is not jelly.
[170:51.39]I'm done.
[170:52.03]No.
[170:52.35]Why did you do this to me?
[170:53.85]I'm not... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[170:55.03]I'm playing Mario.
[171:08.93]I love Goombas.
[171:09.79]I love them so much that I made them a clubhouse.
[171:11.30]Aren't they so cute when they scoot through those clear pipes?
[171:15.20]Someone please go hang out with them and stomp on their heads.
[171:19.90]I'll pay you.
[171:37.58]Wait, I think I have to have the rocket boost.
[171:41.98]Yep, hold on.
[171:42.74]Three rocket boosts?
[171:43.52]How do I get that?
[171:47.66]Uh, I can't.
[171:51.42]I can't get it.
[171:54.02]Holy shit, I didn't die.
[171:58.07]Yes, I did.
[172:26.81]The audio's desyn- I thought we were just gonna crash.
[172:31.45]You can't crash in the tube?
[172:35.28]Oh, okay.
[172:36.50]What the fuck am I doing?
[172:39.02]It's desynced.
[172:45.95]So, listen.
[172:47.31]I'm gonna do a test here, ready?
[172:49.89]Are we synced?
[173:03.04]The audio is ahead.
[173:03.96]The game audio.
[173:08.04]Or me.
[173:10.14]Hold on.
[173:11.68]So wait, hold on, you're like...
[173:15.75]So, me, by 60 milliseconds?
[173:19.45]So, I'm a little late.
[173:20.41]So, like... Okay, let me see if it happens.
[173:22.59]Tell me if it happens when I do this.
[173:29.28]Ready?
[173:30.74]Clear it, clear it, clear it, clear it.
[173:33.38]Ready?
[173:33.58]One, two, three.
[173:36.10]Ding, dong, ding, dong, dong, ding.
[173:45.99]Game audio is ahead.
[173:48.11]Hold on.
[173:54.43]Alright, ready?
[173:55.11]Clear it.
[173:55.41]Clear it, clear it.
[173:57.77]Ding, dong, ding.
[173:59.99]Ding, dong, dong, dong.
[174:01.93]Ding, ding, dong, dong.
[174:09.62]Ding, dong, ding.
[174:11.76]Good.
[174:13.08]Alright, here we go.
[174:16.84]Here we go.
[174:21.31]I need all these keys.
[174:22.41]Ah, that's how you get this town.
[174:45.52]Alright, so where do we go now?
[174:49.70]I'm thinking like a dink right here.
[174:56.93]And then up?
[174:57.61]Nope.
[175:09.43]If I just fell down the hardest thing to die in, it might be time to run the top.
[175:20.88]Through the middle.
[175:24.00]No, stop!
[175:41.09]Coins on this side.
[175:41.75]Coins above.
[175:42.43]Coins down.
[175:43.47]Coins back up.
[175:44.57]Ooh, this will go all the way around.
[175:48.75]That's alright.
[175:49.17]This is the exit.
[175:49.81]Alright.
[175:50.58]So I gotta go this way.
[175:58.32]I can't, like, go... I can't... You can't telefrag him.
[176:01.94]I need one more key.
[176:03.93]It's over there.
[176:05.11]What?
[176:14.99]Alright, let's, I'm, it's fine, I got it.
[176:20.71]Unless, wait, no, no, no, no, no, it's over here.
[176:23.17]There's probably not, there's not a screen, right?
[176:32.88]It's just this?
[176:53.50]So bald.
[176:56.43]What's my voice doing?
[177:05.15]Main hall three.
[177:05.83]Is there a fourth floor to the castle?
[177:08.70]I don't remember.
[177:09.28]Oh, man.
[177:15.44]Oh, fuck.
[177:16.00]Oh, shit.
[177:16.68]Oh, man.
[177:17.18]This is bad.
[177:18.38]We got a problem.
[177:19.88]I shouldn't say this out loud, so here...
[177:24.06]Oh, red toad got kidnapped while we were taking an unauthorized break.
[177:28.27]Please bring red toad back before the chief notices.
[177:31.03]Or we're all busted.
[177:35.95]No, it's not worth screaming.
[177:36.85]It's only... It's been three hours.
[177:39.05]If I screamed, I was going to... My voice would be gone in, like, the next 45 minutes.
[177:46.38]Reach the goal with one toad.
[177:47.54]Woohoo!
[177:58.35]Fine, I'll do it myself.
[178:01.18]Wee!
[178:03.60]Glad I just get the- this is low gravity.
[178:09.26]Oh, this is the best song.
[178:13.26]I think in the long last 10 years or so.
[178:29.91]We're dead!
[178:35.17]He weighed me down.
[178:36.17]Toad, you weighed me down.
[178:39.18]That's what happened.
[178:42.06]Oh yeah, there's like that advanced technique where you can do that.
[178:54.65]You gotta be kidding me.
[178:55.43]Why were you just standing still?
[179:00.47]Don't- How did I not- I almost died in the same spot.
[179:13.00]Is it yellow fish?
[179:32.24]That's a 30 over there.
[179:38.74]Can you jump?
[179:41.30]Jump.
[179:47.05]Oh!
[179:48.15]Oh my god!
[179:48.83]What's happening?
[179:50.51]Oh my god!
[179:51.33]I... I... That hurt my body.
[180:04.82]I fell off that cliff.
[180:10.39]Today's peak the mic day, apparently.
[180:12.49]Yeah, apparently.
[180:13.65]I'm not gonna peak the mic again.
[180:14.51]It's not gonna happen.
[180:15.17]I have to get Toad.
[180:37.48]If I accidentally press the ground pound again.
[180:46.54]There was a time when you had to press down and like right or left trigger at the same time.
[180:52.97]Not just down.
[181:22.06]No, no.
[181:23.32]Don't start over.
[181:24.32]I wanted to get out of the pause menu.
[181:35.44]Accidental button press.
[181:36.96]God.
[181:37.68]It's alright.
[181:38.18]That's not worth it.
[181:40.56]It's 10.
[181:40.84]Who cares?
[182:04.91]It's not worth it.
[182:05.37]It's not worth it.
[182:05.87]I'm freaking out again.
[182:07.27]Jump up the... Toad, come here.
[182:19.74]Oh, it's got my sights on me.
[182:21.10]Toad, get back over here.
[182:24.14]I'm not trying to peek the mic.
[182:40.81]This is a bunch of free one-ups.
[183:09.90]Oh yeah, Mario time!
[183:42.40]Almost enough, right?
[183:48.37]Red Toad is back.
[183:50.95]Think about how many 1-ups I would have had if I didn't do the ground pound.
[184:00.12]I know.
[184:03.32]Bark bark.
[184:04.84]Let's go talk to Red Toad and see if Red Toad has anything cool for us to do.
[184:08.52]Something cool.
[184:16.62]Red Toad?
[184:19.02]Thank you so much for saving me.
[184:20.00]That was legitimately terrifying.
[184:21.26]But they just let me go out of the blue.
[184:24.20]Not that I'm complaining.
[184:24.98]Maybe I was taken by mistake.
[184:27.65]Why can't I just jump off the edge?
[184:43.07]Sleeping on the job.
[184:44.75]There you are.
[184:47.59]Hey kid, want to help me out with a job?
[184:50.24]You help me out, I'll erase the blocks on top of the pipe over there.
[184:55.40]Molten rain.
[184:58.58]Your target this time is seven lava bubbles.
[185:00.62]What's that?
[185:01.00]You don't know how to take out lava bubbles.
[185:03.94]I'm going to pack your lunch too.
[185:06.11]Don't worry so much, amigo.
[185:07.57]You'll figure it out.
[185:09.57]Defeat seven bubbles.
[185:12.99]I'll try.
[185:16.17]Mario's like 40.
[185:23.52]Mario's way older than 40.
[185:24.53]What?
[185:24.77]Oh.
[185:57.71]Get them all.
[185:58.19]For the true ending.
[186:00.09]Never mind.
[186:00.79]Who cares?
[186:03.31]Give me one.
[186:38.78]Got them all
[187:15.68]Alright, take him down.
[187:16.88]Is this the guy that beat Dark Souls?
[187:20.66]Yeah, this is the guy that beat the last boss in Sekiro.
[187:24.04]The true last boss.
[187:34.77]Stop, settle down.
[187:35.71]Did he just, like, die?
[187:44.96]He just used his whole head to do that.
[187:46.72]Is he alright?
[187:48.06]Okay.
[187:53.97]Any more?
[187:54.63]He's got more.
[188:00.73]Erase the blocks gumming up the path over there.
[188:04.17]Spiny Busters.
[188:06.05]Kill 15 spines.
[188:08.41]Use whatever tools you have at your disposal.
[188:09.91]Adios.
[188:11.91]Counting on you.
[188:26.10]So how do you get rid of the spines?
[188:27.48]I get it.
[188:58.58]Okay, I got them, but... It didn't work.
[189:03.59]Come on.
[189:03.85]I can get it.
[189:05.97]Ready?
[189:14.11]No, no, no.
[189:14.97]I got it.
[189:15.35]I'm fine.
[189:15.67]I didn't touch it?
[189:27.39]I clearly touched that.
[189:35.14]That was pretty clear.
[189:37.52]Get rid of the path here.
[189:40.42]Sweet.
[189:43.88]Nice work, kid.
[189:45.04]Off those blocks now.
[189:46.32]Alright, you lousy bunch of blocks.
[189:49.36]This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it hurt you.
[190:05.70]Adios.
[190:07.08]That's it?
[190:15.06]There's ten coins.
[190:19.02]I make ten coins in my sleep.
[190:20.86]If you help me out, I'll give you some fancy clothes.
[190:26.48]I got $1,229.
[190:27.18]I make that in my sleep.
[190:30.65]A single pom-pom.
[190:35.64]This time your target is a single pom-pom.
[190:37.36]They probably know you're coming, so expect a trap.
[190:39.30]Adios.
[190:40.39]And I get a t-shirt.
[190:43.21]Defeat one pom-pom.
[190:48.73]Everyone streaming Mario Maker 2 today?
[190:51.11]Well, it is brand new.
[190:53.23]Brand new game.
[190:54.97]On a beloved franchise.
[190:59.27]Reach the goal to defeating all the pom-pom.
[191:10.99]Let me hit you!
[191:41.82]That's the one.
[191:44.01]You gotta let her do it.
[191:49.71]What the?
[191:50.19]One more time.
[191:51.07]Thanks for the key.
[192:24.10]So what's the, uh, what I get for, uh, clothing?
[192:29.38]I love it.
[192:31.48]It's like a Cookie Monster shirt.
[192:36.87]Can I put these on or is that my me?
[192:40.09]I think that's my me.
[192:40.91]What is this button?
[192:41.51]Okay, hold on.
[192:43.41]Where does this go?
[193:01.12]Why did you do that?
[193:04.43]Hello.
[193:06.03]Have time for a job?
[193:07.01]There's something good in here for you.
[193:12.35]House of Blocks.
[193:15.21]We're in the market for a new house and we need someone to inspect this place we found.
[193:19.42]Hit the blocks and climb to the top to check it out.
[193:21.50]You can also tilt in mid or ground pound.
[193:24.46]I hate doing that.
[193:37.66]So the goal is that it's a climate.
[193:39.42]I like the background.
[193:40.56]Start building?
[193:40.96]Yeah, I'm getting too caught up in the cartoon characters.
[194:05.71]Whoa.
[194:06.31]Oh, that works.
[194:08.41]Ooh.
[194:08.93]I just kind of popped myself there.
[194:34.85]All the way back down.
[194:35.67]Really?
[194:36.05]Oh, please.
[194:37.86]I was a super mean boy?
[194:38.92]Good music.
[194:39.50]I'll take the music track.
[195:09.31]Okay, get out of the way.
[195:11.55]I almost did it again.
[195:40.56]Get me up there.
[195:42.28]No!
[195:44.00]There's a coin!
[195:44.84]I can get by.
[195:45.78]I'll just go back.
[195:50.06]Whatever.
[195:50.58]Nice.
[195:51.08]Whatever.
[196:10.57]Sorry, I got plenty of money.
[196:12.67]Today was 10, it wasn't that big of a deal.
[196:16.41]I'm gonna go build the rest of the, uh, hall.
[196:22.86]Thank you!
[196:23.86]Alright, I'm gonna make something good.
[196:25.84]Buildy, buildy, roo roo, miracle roo.
[196:31.40]Oh.
[196:32.42]Ooh.
[196:35.80]Cool.
[196:36.92]I put a special block somewhere.
[196:39.88]Well, it just told me where it was.
[196:41.56]Stop being mad.
[196:45.52]I'm not mad.
[196:46.32]What do you mean mad?
[196:57.64]Alright, we got... No, I have... I need to go talk to the chief.
[197:02.18]We need to start construction.
[197:04.52]Anyway, main hall, third floor is complete.
[197:06.78]The castle is bursting at the seams with elegance.
[197:08.81]It's looking... It's like looking into a mirror.
[197:13.83]We have new building options now.
[197:18.83]West Hall Cannon.
[197:21.45]Sounds fun.
[197:28.76]And I can afford the West Hall top.
[197:35.93]582.
[197:38.37]West Hall doors.
[197:40.61]Do it.
[197:41.17]I am gonna go hit that block though.
[197:50.17]So what's in the special blocks?
[197:57.55]Why would I ask chat that question when in the time that there's like a five second- three to five second delay, I would have already hit it and known.
[198:04.14]That's funny.
[198:16.64]What's wrong with you?
[198:18.55]I want to punch Toad in the mouth so fucking bad.
[198:22.03]Why?
[198:22.45]What's- why would you say something like that?
[198:30.42]Yellow Toad's been sleeping.
[198:33.66]Paw wake up call.
[198:35.08]Reach the goal after defeating all nine spinies.
[198:37.98]Hit some paw blocks, you might be able to wake up this nameless Toad.
[198:45.61]So we gotta defeat all the spinies.
[198:54.75]Punch him in the mouth.
[199:06.61]Where's the other one?
[199:08.81]Ooh!
[199:16.68]Just... It's done, right?
[199:18.24]That's it?
[199:18.66]9 out of 9.
[199:19.06]Get out.
[199:19.50]That was quick.
[199:21.50]That was cool.
[199:42.65]40%, 41, 42%?
[199:42.79]Something like that?
[199:47.05]I had to go through all that to wake him up.
[199:55.15]Why wouldn't I just kick him?
[200:00.92]I mean, like, gently.
[200:09.74]Oh, just scream.
[200:11.12]Just lean down and just be like... Hey!
[200:15.64]Hey, wake up!
[200:18.68]That's gonna be easy.
[200:19.26]Reach the goal while holding the stone.
[200:21.14]Bring me a stone.
[200:50.48]Reach the goal while holding a stone.
[200:51.66]Where's the stone?
[201:02.29]One of these?
[201:04.03]Can I break one of these off?
[201:10.55]You didn't mention what stone, you just said A stone.
[201:17.29]Can I actually play as Luigi?
[201:20.29]I don't want to call him, though.
[201:24.39]I don't want to talk to him.
[201:27.30]Somebody else call him.
[201:31.44]Oh, there's a...
[201:37.81]That very clearly was eaten and puked up.
[201:41.78]Where's the stone?
[202:15.55]How am I supposed to get up there?
[202:18.93]I mean, that's how I... This is how I'm gonna do it.
[202:24.24]Where's the stone?
[202:32.65]I didn't even see a stone to pick up.
[202:50.41]Wait, what?
[203:36.91]Kill them!
[204:06.96]8 seconds!
[204:17.15]You can't throw- it's too heavy!
[204:18.79]I tried to throw it up like 3 times!
[204:43.42]I- you- it's- the thing is really heavy!
[204:49.92]Twitch acting!
[204:51.00]Get outta here!
[204:51.80]It's- it's bullshit!
[204:58.99]This is bullshit!
[205:04.59]Oh my god, I-
[205:15.65]I get called one more time by Luigi.
[205:17.41]I'm gonna fucking be mad.
[205:29.57]Gimme this motherfucker.
[205:30.51]Get over here.
[205:32.55]Kill all of them.
[205:33.79]Kill them all.
[205:35.51]Literally kill them all.
[205:38.03]I don't want to see any of their faces ever again.
[205:43.53]That's what's making this so stupid.
[205:45.03]It's just dodging the fucking six bones that are on the screen at the same time.
[205:50.13]Get out of here!
[205:52.45]Alright, now I can play the game.
[205:56.80]They're gonna come back.
[205:57.50]Aren't they?
[206:04.82]I'm so tilted right now.
[206:06.16]I guess someone call me an actor.
[206:08.30]Because I couldn't throw a brick on top of the stove.
[206:12.10]Or whatever the dumb thing is.
[206:41.14]oh yeah yeah is that what it is guys
[207:04.92]He just fucking- Come on, man.
[207:07.58]Go- I gotta get three.
[207:08.70]Oh.
[207:08.86]Do I need more?
[207:09.80]I- I need more than one.
[207:35.44]I'm gonna lose time again
[208:16.51]Fucking actor.
[208:23.36]Thank you for the applause, that was a pretty good acting job.
[208:46.52]That was a one-star quest.
[208:52.67]Oh, go get more stones this time.
[208:54.13]Make sure you eat it through the wall.
[209:15.77]Alright, I'm gonna do this one first try here.
[209:20.52]This doesn't require me to eat it through the wall with Yoshi.
[209:57.56]I want to get this.
[209:58.96]Can I wall jump off this?
[210:29.50]How do I get that?
[210:35.45]There's gotta be a way to get that, right?
[210:51.32]Oh my god, it's already fucking time to go to bed.
[211:08.51]Oh shit, hold on.
[211:10.41]Dive kick.
[211:11.37]I want those.
[211:11.97]Whatever, I don't have time for this.
[211:47.16]I thought that was going to kill me for a second.
[211:48.94]Where's the bomb?
[211:49.94]There's going to be a bomb here.
[211:53.34]Oh, no.
[211:54.10]What?
[211:54.30]Can I kick it?
[211:54.94]What did I just do?
[211:55.92]What did I just do?
[211:56.82]What did I just do?
[211:57.36]Okay, hold on.
[212:05.47]I want that... I want that shit.
[212:12.59]I don't think I can get it.
[212:13.73]The bomb bomb thing was gone.
[212:20.07]I thought another football and bill thing was gonna play.
[212:25.13]Such emotional range.
[212:26.96]Good acting.
[213:01.00]Alright, one more.
[213:03.70]And the stones, I hate the stone ones.
[213:10.47]The worst addition to the game so far.
[213:12.27]Can I go up?
[213:27.48]No, let me go, let me actually go up.
[213:38.06]You got a combination of a stone level and a water level.
[213:41.51]I may as well just punch the toad in the face like that guy wanted to like an hour ago.
[213:46.45]No, don't let it fall.
[214:22.71]The active thing is making me laugh like over and over again.
[214:57.69]We need the water to come down.
[214:59.39]Up!
[214:59.63]No, up!
[215:00.33]Thank you.
[215:31.37]Only five?
[215:34.47]I'm so tilted about the actor joke.
[215:37.83]No, I'm not tilted about the actor joke.
[215:39.77]I'm tilted about the stone.
[215:43.87]I couldn't do the stone, and because I couldn't do the stone level, the fact that somebody said that I was pretending to not know how to do the stone level because I didn't know how to do that, it was infuriating me.
[215:59.30]Because I actually didn't know.
[216:12.88]Alright, I can do another build.
[216:26.97]This new area looks pretty good.
[216:47.82]That was close.
[216:48.46]Oh, that car almost hit me.
[216:51.96]I flinched and moved.
[216:53.92]I felt that one coming in here.
[216:54.94]Okay, I need a thousand.
[217:01.31]Is that all the jobs that Stone Toad wanted me to do?
[217:07.89]Let's get some more money.
[217:12.01]Is it going to take forever?
[217:14.30]I'm already 52% of the way there.
[217:17.56]It's only been three and a half hours, guys.
[217:18.82]What are you talking about?
[217:21.52]Boo's Towering House of Terror.
[217:27.86]Am I going to play Animal Crossing when it comes out?
[217:32.18]Maybe.
[217:33.27]That depends on if anybody wants to see it.
[217:40.09]It was worth a shot.
[217:49.77]I felt the world start moving to the right, so I figured maybe it was a possibility.
[217:56.04]Oh, jeez.
[217:56.46]Come on.
[218:20.64]Scooby-Doo house.
[218:21.70]Um, sure.
[218:25.30]Gonna go all the way to here.
[218:27.88]This is making my blood moldy.
[218:30.64]How does your blood mold?
[218:32.49]And why do you have blood sitting out?
[218:51.21]That's, I think, a better question.
[218:53.95]Those ones are faster.
[218:58.24]Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.
[219:01.42]What do I do about this?
[219:02.18]I think I have to go like this.
[219:04.16]Oh man!
[219:06.18]Why did I turn?
[219:10.11]I got it.
[219:10.73]I'm good.
[219:18.03]What?
[219:28.63]I want a mushroom.
[219:44.36]I don't feel safe right now.
[219:49.64]I need a mushroom
[220:07.72]Once the blood gets out, it starts to sour.
[220:17.30]I don't... I don't... Oh, yeah, right.
[220:19.34]Talking about the blood that you were eating or something, right?
[220:23.91]Big showdown on Little Star.
[220:26.51]Has Toad given me any four-star levels?
[220:28.97]Oh, there's one.
[220:30.47]It's already done, though.
[220:34.58]yeah that's what I already did big showdown on little star if anyone receives this transmission please help bowser jr has invaded the small planet and we require assistance the gravity is odd here but you can still hold b while bouncing off of enemies to do a super jump stomp bowser into submission
[221:07.21]Ooh, cute sound.
[221:23.18]It told me if I held B, it would jump off of this.
[221:26.68]And... You told me if I held B. I'm holding B right now.
[221:32.07]I'm holding B at the moment.
[221:33.31]Right now.
[221:47.93]Oh, God.
[221:55.10]It's not that bad.
[221:57.60]Not as bad as I originally thought it was gonna be.
[222:00.42]There's the moon!
[222:09.88]The moon attacks you too?
[222:16.56]He has a smiling face.
[222:17.94]The sun is angry.
[222:21.71]The moon shouldn't be like this.
[222:22.85]It's worth a shot to see if anything in here.
[222:34.34]What just...
[222:41.30]Oh.
[222:42.70]You guys weren't kidding when you said it gives you lives.
[222:45.81]I've been trying to avoid it the whole time.
[222:50.07]Okay.
[222:54.22]Is that Bowser Jr.?
[222:54.96]This is like infant Bowser.
[223:15.91]Thanks for the key!
[223:20.56]That was a loud thud.
[223:23.34]See, I want to play more levels like this.
[223:30.70]The fun, cute ones.
[223:45.84]This is boring boomer levels.
[223:51.92]Well, you gotta do them.
[223:52.72]You gotta make the money.
[223:53.36]Uh, what do I need?
[224:02.30]A thousand?
[224:02.84]What about the little block down there?
[224:05.30]No, I need money.
[224:06.78]I'll go do the block stuff when I get enough money to build again.
[224:10.80]Red Yoshi's Cheap Cheap Cleanup.
[224:14.03]Reach the goal after defeating at least 25 Cheep Cheeps.
[224:19.71]Go, go, go.
[224:24.00]He's only in it for the money.
[224:26.20]Yes, in Mario Maker 2.
[224:28.38]Correct.
[224:41.96]Am I going to do any created levels tonight?
[224:43.40]Yeah, we'll probably see.
[224:46.26]I'm assuming I'll get this single-player stuff done.
[224:51.97]Probably in the next couple hours?
[224:56.73]We'll see.
[225:01.83]We'll see how it goes.
[225:02.59]Am I going to hurt him?
[225:11.33]I missed a couple.
[225:11.97]Free!
[225:12.78]Shit.
[225:13.38]Shit.
[225:13.78]Shit!
[225:15.26]Oh no.
[225:39.71]Oh, that's fine.
[225:40.91]Wait, it's not fine.
[225:42.44]Can I do it again?
[225:43.18]I don't need Yoshi anymore, right?
[225:44.58]No, that's it.
[226:10.82]Alright, let's go.
[226:23.09]But yeah, after the end of this... This will probably take us to the six to seven hour mark.
[226:28.90]I feel like I would just do Mario Maker 2 again.
[226:30.38]And just do graded levels.
[226:32.16]Because I feel like...
[226:33.75]I don't know, part of me says that the multiplayer, there's probably some cool stuff, but it hadn't even been a day.
[226:38.19]I think I'd want to give at least a few days or something for people to make cool levels.
[226:45.37]Alright, this one's two star.
[226:54.03]Hit the on-off switch to get the pink coins.
[226:56.97]There's been some neat stuff already.
[227:01.57]Yeah, we'll see how... I'm having a great time here.
[227:05.55]This is just what I'm looking for right now.
[227:09.15]Do a Jerma level thing.
[227:11.01]That's another thing too.
[227:11.74]I mean, if people wanted to make stuff, I'm definitely going to play this again.
[227:15.48]That's certain.
[227:17.14]So maybe people want to make some stuff if they really felt like it.
[227:20.58]Alright, so hold on.
[227:23.30]I'm going to do this puzzle.
[227:30.79]Alright, so there's that.
[227:31.85]There's that one.
[227:33.13]And, okay, we could do this.
[227:49.23]I gotta get that
[228:12.64]There's one, there's two, there's three Switch it off first Oops-a-daisy Oops Let's keep it on
[228:38.55]What are you doing?
[228:41.59]Now turn it off after it bounces.
[228:49.02]I want to give you my Pokémon cards.
[228:50.62]You keep your Pokémon cards.
[228:52.94]Those are gonna be worth like thousands of dollars one day.
[229:04.84]Oh shit.
[229:05.32]Okay, hold on.
[229:05.96]I gotta time this.
[229:09.59]No, no, no, no.
[229:10.63]I'm gonna keep it locked in on the other one.
[229:14.43]And then now we do it... Not now.
[229:17.98]Now.
[229:18.24]Ooh.
[229:32.17]Oh, I have the helmet on it so I can get it.
[229:33.71]Nice.
[229:33.93]Should I break them all?
[229:36.75]Or at least these ones?
[229:37.49]There might be some treasure in here or something.
[229:40.27]It's possible.
[229:41.93]Not the ones I have to step on.
[229:44.63]Like that.
[229:44.99]Alright, don't... I'm not going to fuck around.
[229:51.47]Don't... If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[229:55.32]I thought there might be a coin thing in there.
[230:09.02]Secret block.
[230:09.56]Right.
[230:09.70]That's what I'm saying.
[230:14.42]If it ain't fixed, don't break it.
[230:23.30]Blink, blank, blunk.
[230:27.79]I made a house for ant troopers out of blinking blocks.
[230:30.17]Can someone check to make sure the path is clear?
[230:33.35]I will do it.
[230:33.71]And then after this, I'll have enough money to do the other wing.
[230:38.09]Because I need 1100.
[230:39.83]And then we'll go back down to Block Guy.
[230:41.49]And see what he wants to do.
[230:44.91]Bye.
[231:05.54]Coins, coins, coins.
[231:06.74]Let him fall over here so I can just kill him.
[231:16.85]I can make that.
[231:20.07]Yeah, these look... Yeah, the ants look super weird.
[231:24.47]They really do.
[231:34.13]I gotta get as many coins as I can possibly grab with two hands.
[231:37.32]Can I say ants again?
[231:39.98]Ants.
[232:21.37]You fucking idiot.
[232:22.73]Oh my god, I tried to do it so fast.
[232:33.08]It's alright, I'm right here.
[232:53.54]What just happened to me?
[233:27.70]Slow down, Evan's gonna fall.
[233:29.44]Alright, I'm good.
[233:31.96]No, just jump on them.
[233:35.22]Unnecessary.
[233:37.58]Unnecessary.
[234:07.26]I love in-between all this.
[234:09.62]Somebody just writes.
[234:15.71]Why?
[234:17.69]I don't even understand.
[234:18.79]Alright.
[234:24.15]West Hall roof.
[234:25.51]Might as well just finish the West Hall.
[234:33.80]Now I'm going to go down to the block guy.
[234:41.41]Construction has started on the West Hall roof.
[234:42.73]We got the construction covered.
[234:44.31]Just get out of here.
[234:46.51]Seven new jobs.
[234:47.21]But I want to go over here.
[234:49.11]Because now doing these jobs will complete the building, right?
[234:57.47]Okay.
[235:04.88]Darkness ahead, darkness below.
[235:08.50]Could you take a look at the basement and tell us how spacious it is?
[235:12.07]It's gonna be a dark level.
[235:14.81]Do I have any thoughts on gaming?
[235:18.27]No, not really.
[235:21.86]It's pretty fun.
[235:23.72]This one's gonna be hell.
[235:27.38]I remember doing this one in Donkey Kong Country, and it made me break a Nintendo 64 controller.
[235:33.08]Oh no, whatever it was, Super Nintendo.
[235:52.24]Scary.
[235:53.42]Actually scary.
[235:54.28]That's a lot of coins, though.
[236:13.96]I can't wait for people to make horror games.
[236:17.75]They're going to.
[236:18.39]Oh, why did I wait that extra second for... I waited a half second for no reason.
[236:31.84]I don't know why I did that.
[236:36.50]That hurts.
[236:39.18]Okay.
[236:56.13]Flare.
[236:57.85]Ding dong.
[237:01.01]Did I find a secret?
[237:01.91]Get me out of that one.
[237:15.46]Amazon package.
[237:16.88]Yeah, that's true.
[237:18.00]Alright, after this next one, I'm gonna take the first break of the night.
[237:22.59]I'm gonna grab something to drink, go to the bathroom, and I might even eat a piece of turkey as quickly as I can.
[237:32.99]Where are you putting this one?
[237:36.29]I put a, oh, a hidden block.
[237:38.69]Red flower.
[237:39.47]Red flower.
[237:46.06]Interesting.
[237:46.82]You got any more?
[237:47.50]Yep.
[237:51.66]One last job and we get an outfit.
[237:55.10]Finally found a place that we love, but it's been infested by thwomps.
[237:59.53]Could you please survey the damage they've done?
[238:01.13]Yep.
[238:08.63]Hi, top thwomp tower.
[238:14.73]Can I stand on his head?
[238:23.94]Yes, I can.
[238:26.92]Sometimes, I don't know.
[238:31.04]Cranberry sauces, fruit jello?
[238:35.47]Whatever your opinion is on that, I respect it and that's fine.
[238:39.13]That's it.
[239:00.72]I probably could have seen that one coming, but I didn't.
[239:18.94]Come on, jump down.
[239:24.68]He's getting impatient.
[239:30.69]This is where it starts to derail if he does anything else stupid.
[239:50.13]I'm down.
[239:56.12]Oh, Jesus.
[239:58.76]Oh!
[240:03.33]Oh!
[240:04.87]Same audio clip.
[240:06.23]Oh!
[240:07.07]Oh!
[240:08.39]Oh!
[240:12.84]Oh, for real!
[240:27.02]Bring them over.
[240:27.52]I have to get that.
[240:31.02]I just have to trigger it so much earlier.
[240:57.50]I just got, that was hit box, oh dude, hit box porn!
[241:01.08]Hit box!
[241:09.91]Oh!
[241:22.98]Actor.
[241:29.30]I missed a secret?
[241:29.92]I don't care.
[241:40.25]This stream title is actually better than others?
[241:42.49]What?
[241:43.01]Oh, it's, yeah, it's just... You should have seen it before.
[241:48.20]I went through two or three iterations.
[241:49.50]I love this shirt.
[241:51.55]What was it before I turned the stream on?
[241:52.77]It was It's A Me and then space in brackets.
[241:56.13]Hey Greg Smith, I just want to let you know if you're watching, if you come across this, you have a package that I have for you.
[242:02.50]Just come in and confirm that it's your package.
[242:04.82]End bracket.
[242:08.97]It was something like that.
[242:10.01]It was like a whole three sentences.
[242:25.22]Yeah, it also was haha what?
[242:26.86]Wait, red flower?
[242:27.90]I'm gonna make a wicked... Okay.
[242:35.06]Alright, so what's up here?
[242:54.24]50.
[242:54.38]There's a frog up here.
[242:56.54]Secret frog.
[242:57.12]Cheap, cheap maze.
[243:00.96]This one's pretty hard.
[243:02.00]This is sound frog.
[243:02.78]It's Super Frog.
[243:23.17]Oh, I hope it has candy.
[243:26.35]Take the break?
[243:26.93]I forgot.
[243:27.53]Sorry.
[243:28.21]It's underwater.
[243:29.03]Delete.
[243:30.81]I'm just going to close my eyes.
[243:36.19]I'm closing my eyes right now.
[243:37.35]Who cares?
[243:37.63]Go.
[243:37.71]How am I doing?
[243:54.99]Have I hit anything yet?
[243:56.86]I think I'm in a wall, I think.
[243:58.80]I'm definitely, like, trapped in a wall.
[244:00.84]Should I open my eyes?
[244:07.61]I'm gonna open them.
[244:08.53]Okay.
[244:09.63]Whoa, I'm just, like, floating here.
[244:10.63]That's cool.
[244:12.91]Was I just floating there the whole time?
[244:27.62]Quiet.
[244:28.86]Turn it into the orchestra one.
[244:31.26]Mm-hmm.
[244:31.64]Mm-hmm.
[244:32.06]Mm-hmm.
[244:32.58]Mm-hmm.
[245:01.08]Okay, I'm fine.
[245:11.25]Can I make it?
[245:11.85]Is it enough?
[245:13.69]Is that enough?
[245:14.27]No, it's not.
[245:23.77]Is that space there?
[245:32.01]fucking just don't do that play oh yeah
[245:58.05]Thought about it.
[246:02.89]I lost all the coins that I got, though.
[246:05.09]Pissing me off.
[246:06.15]Pissing me off.
[246:11.22]Okay, good.
[246:15.34]Oh my god, I'm just- I don't like this one.
[246:43.82]What the fuck?
[246:44.94]Oh my god!
[246:46.82]I gotta take that break.
[246:48.08]No, I don't.
[246:48.86]Do it.
[246:49.34]Get it done.
[246:56.65]Yeah, I do.
[246:57.39]No, I don't.
[247:18.64]Should I go over them?
[247:21.27]I guess?
[247:22.01]Oh god.
[247:22.39]I have to do the whole thing again.
[248:17.38]Thank you.
[249:00.64]you
[249:51.68]Thank you for watching!
[250:54.56]Guys, I don't have a switch anymore.
[250:58.02]I just frisbeated out the window as hard as I could.
[251:00.70]Oh, the music box, never mind.
[251:07.50]You guys have been trapped here forever.
[251:22.35]Oh, come on.
[251:24.89]Just whatever.
[251:27.31]Oh, what the hell?
[251:58.94]Oh my god, it's the floatiness of the water combined with the smallness of the character, combined with the music in the background, combined with the darkness that is making me have a problem.
[252:30.26]Got them all didn't I?
[252:36.73]No, I didn't.
[252:37.31]Almost.
[252:57.85]Come on, get it.
[252:59.25]No, I got it.
[252:59.67]Okay.
[253:10.02]I'm good.
[253:13.86]Trevor, are you mad?
[253:20.84]Are you mad at us?
[253:25.02]Why would I be mad at you guys?
[253:26.71]For what?
[253:31.81]My thanks are yours.
[253:33.07]The flowers bloom.
[253:34.33]And down we get... Ribbit!
[253:40.71]Do the floss, please.
[253:47.72]Brightness, come on.
[253:56.66]Two more, right?
[254:03.82]Yes, there's more.
[254:04.60]That means they're going to be harder.
[254:09.54]I'll move some mountains.
[254:10.90]Hold your breath.
[254:11.60]Another underwater one.
[254:15.26]I'm determined to show my dearest my finest qualities.
[254:17.38]I know you should be impressed to see me swim across the river without once coming up for air.
[254:21.82]Reach the goal without getting out of the water.
[254:29.77]I'm not looking forward to this one.
[254:36.20]Is this the way to kill Mario?
[254:49.70]Grab this, whatever it is.
[254:50.80]You missed, just... I didn't get out.
[254:56.56]I'm still in.
[254:58.02]I was holding my head under the water.
[255:06.74]Get away from me.
[255:08.66]Can I step on your head?
[255:10.30]Yes, I can.
[255:13.16]Don't.
[255:14.56]Fire underwater don't really make much sense, I know, but it is a video game.
[255:17.70]Okay.
[255:41.85]I was looking over a chat.
[255:43.95]Somebody just shut up, so I just looked at it, and I was like, hey, why'd that person say shut up?
[255:46.67]Why is everything 10 FPS?
[255:49.16]Shouldn't be.
[255:50.68]This one's a lot easier than the last one.
[256:12.48]I'm not gonna choke.
[256:13.72]I'm good.
[256:14.40]Didn't choke.
[256:46.91]That took longer than winning going forward.
[256:49.21]I thought it was going to be a mushroom.
[256:53.58]I wasn't on top of his head?
[256:55.84]I wasn't on top of his head.
[256:57.82]I wasn't on his head.
[256:58.58]I don't understand that.
[257:08.33]I'm going fast.
[257:31.70]Go up, water, go up, go up!
[257:33.19]Already got it, don't even need it.
[257:36.33]Alright, come on.
[257:38.53]Do this underwater level while holding your breath in real life.
[258:08.10]That's a pretty dumb idea.
[258:09.66]So I'm gonna have to say, I'm gonna decline that gamer funny challenge there.
[258:14.51]Just shoot him.
[258:18.71]I'm still in!
[259:03.04]I'm sorry about the mic being peaked.
[259:04.99]I really am.
[259:05.75]I'm not like this.
[259:07.09]This is the first stream you've ever watched on my channel.
[259:09.91]I'm not like this.
[259:12.15]I don't like... Did he just get rid of the pole?
[259:14.30]How do I complete the level?
[259:24.31]Oh, yeah Mario time I don't usually no I don't usually snore you're right What is this gg idiot, what is this I can't even hear it anyways, never mind I got my other headphones plugged in The mountains move a groove so funky
[259:53.82]Here we go.
[259:54.56]Here they come.
[259:56.85]Kinda ugly.
[260:31.58]You got anything else?
[260:32.14]You got one more.
[260:32.88]It's gonna be a four star.
[260:38.16]Special close.
[260:38.95]It is a four star difficulty, Sea of Sorrow.
[260:44.15]My dearest has dumped me.
[260:45.97]And so I float aimlessly adrift on a sea of sorrow.
[260:48.89]Wallow with me, Mario.
[260:54.71]That got sort of sad.
[261:04.04]Is this with him crying?
[261:05.82]Get in the shoe.
[261:07.70]Now what?
[261:32.94]Punch all ghosts in the face?
[261:35.09]I looked at chat.
[261:40.25]He doesn't know, and that's why I looked over there.
[262:10.63]Let's continue.
[262:31.17]Alright, so watch out, there's a... You can crush the blocks, right?
[262:34.81]And then come down.
[262:35.43]Now, you gonna come down?
[262:38.71]Do you come down?
[262:41.85]Well, I guess you kind of do.
[262:46.02]All the way.
[262:51.74]Alright, what's over here?
[262:53.84]This is one of those freaky levels.
[263:01.49]Yeah, this is a freaky one
[269:10.21]What's the goal here?
[269:11.21]What's the end goal?
[269:17.68]Well... Just leave me be, please.
[269:24.78]I can't believe he just fucking sniped me.
[269:27.44]You gotta be kidding me.
[269:29.01]It's alright, this is it, right?
[269:30.15]Okay.
[269:42.96]That wasn't even really that bad, but it kind of was.
[269:45.71]Aww, frog cap.
[269:50.28]What is this mold your blood thing?
[269:51.68]I don't understand.
[269:53.64]Don't mold your blood.
[269:54.66]Mold, mold.
[269:55.44]Is this like a new thing that I don't know what it is?
[270:15.54]Seven jobs.
[270:16.82]How much is it to build?
[270:23.26]Okay.
[270:24.81]Keep up the good work.
[270:25.69]I'm going to do main hall roof.
[270:30.57]I need 1,500.
[270:30.97]I need money.
[270:32.01]Is there a...
[270:46.36]I can't, like, change my costume right now.
[270:52.93]Alright, we got three more and then we got a pretty hard one, so... Deep in the Windy Valley.
[271:00.18]Can you withstand the cold and make it to the bottom of the valley?
[271:02.14]Let's see.
[271:08.24]Am I not going to make any courses?
[271:09.44]Not on stream, no.
[271:11.50]I am absolutely 100% not capable of making an interesting level on this stream.
[271:17.79]No way.
[271:18.65]I'm going to wait until the wind blows this way.
[271:24.55]Okay.
[271:38.23]He doesn't believe in himself.
[271:42.42]I mean, I just... I just don't believe I could... make anything that was worth watching.
[271:48.58]Because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[271:53.94]I didn't do the... I didn't really make any in the first one.
[271:57.30]I'd have to relearn all the tools.
[272:00.48]That would be like a six-hour tutorial stream.
[272:04.75]I'd rather just make the cool shit that people have.
[272:07.97]And enjoy the awesome creativity that the community puts forth.
[272:14.63]After I beat the single player.
[272:15.61]Because this is fucking fun.
[272:17.23]And I almost got really mad.
[272:18.51]There's the key.
[272:43.99]Play League of Legends?
[272:45.05]Now that's something I can guarantee I have never heard before on this channel.
[272:52.74]That's a lot of coins.
[273:00.78]I'll take it.
[273:01.14]No, I'm not gonna play League.
[273:06.04]Sorry, unfortunately.
[273:08.60]Not gonna be playing League of Legends on this channel.
[273:19.38]He offered you to play League.
[273:20.50]I double... I will double it if you don't.
[273:23.23]Whatever he will offer you to play League, I'll double it if you don't.
[273:28.53]Can I just say no?
[273:30.61]Why does it have to be money involved?
[273:34.90]Two more.
[273:43.64]Seesaws.
[273:44.37]Ancient Seesaw Fortress.
[273:56.74]You don't have to play LOL, but you have to make an obnoxious YouTube ad for it.
[274:02.16]Does Lee have... What the hell did that just say?
[274:06.38]That's weird.
[274:09.57]Come on, respawn them.
[274:15.09]I already blew the opportunity.
[274:16.60]Can I just die?
[274:17.41]Kill me.
[274:31.02]There are League of Legends YouTuber ads.
[274:34.24]You know what actually has been seen a lot of lately on iPad, especially iPad games, is pretend YouTubers.
[274:43.57]And fake pretend streamers.
[274:46.21]They're playing the game that they're advertising on their, whatever their 15, 20, 30 second ad is, and they pretend that this is a YouTuber.
[274:57.32]Like, oh my god, I can't believe it.
[274:58.92]Guys, so this new game that came out, it's just like this, that's not a real person.
[275:02.46]It's a fake name, too.
[275:14.43]Like, this person is not a streamer.
[275:16.67]They have a username and all, and the person doesn't exist.
[275:23.15]Uh, should I be doing something here?
[275:28.94]I guess not.
[275:29.66]Come on, do I not weigh enough?
[276:06.07]Come on, get it up there Come on Well, I'll give you the shoe

[276:56.47]Yeah, get over here.
[276:59.77]Get over here.
[277:00.51]Just step off.
[277:01.95]Oh, you are really, really being dumb.

[278:50.40]That was real.
[278:51.40]Now my back hurts.

[279:42.15]I have to walk you all the way up here.

[281:05.89]First of all, I gotta knock... I gotta get his... I gotta think about this, because what happens if I fuck this up?
[281:15.27]Oh, I still don't have it anymore!
[281:35.12]Sometimes you gotta just take the damage frames.
[281:46.96]Damage frames are not cheating.
[281:49.38]They're a part of the game.
[281:50.84]Alright.
[281:56.54]Let's build.

[284:39.59]Funny noise.

[285:54.16]Can I see more of the level?
[285:55.56]What the hell?
[285:58.08]This is dangerous.
[285:59.34]I can't see.

[286:52.21]It's alright.
[286:53.97]Not a big deal.
[286:57.48]Where's the explosion?
[286:58.18]Damage frames!
[287:00.84]Use them!
[287:02.88]Yes!
[287:21.81]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[287:22.97]Oh, it wasn't easy.
[287:25.45]It was quickly.
[287:28.32]It was quickly.
[287:32.02]Mm-mm, mm-mm.
[287:37.56]Have I really played, like, 50-something levels?
[287:39.92]The underground...
[287:48.68]Piranha Creeper, the Underground Menace.
[287:51.37]I'll pay you to take care of it.
[287:58.45]40 equals 50.
[287:59.71]I have played 50-something level.
[288:02.09]Because... I did 40 in a row here on this list, and then I also did the dog.
[288:07.17]I also did the...
[288:11.03]Eraser head man.
[288:13.03]I also did the yawning guy.
[288:15.55]It's like 55 or something.
[288:17.49]You don't think I know what I'm doing?
[288:27.18]Oh shit, I gotta outrun the snake.
[288:43.79]I like these things.
[288:44.51]This is cool.
[288:44.95]Right in the mouth.
[288:48.35]Alright.
[288:48.97]Fire flower?
[288:52.38]Give it here.
[289:16.68]Oh shit.
[289:17.18]Oh no, he's gonna eat me.
[289:22.53]It's alright, it's alright.
[289:28.83]I swear to god, I swear to god, I just... The stick against the wall thing is just... I'm not... I just... I had it, but then I didn't go on the other side.
[289:54.28]This is the ASMR level.
[289:56.32]What makes you say that?
[289:57.04]I'm gonna get that 10 points.
[289:59.70]Watch.
[289:59.86]Damage breaks!
[290:01.30]Oh my god, don't do it again, Jeremy, please!
[290:18.36]You've got to be kidding me.
[290:20.46]The fucking button.
[290:22.94]The button.
[290:24.44]The stupid little tiny fucking chocolate chip buttons.
[290:29.51]I pressed them all.
[291:01.76]I got a niece, right?
[291:03.64]This niece is... She's six.
[291:11.59]I really do believe that she would have trouble holding this and pressing buttons because her hands are too big.
[291:17.21]If this guy kills me, I quit.
[291:55.50]I have to- Liar.
[292:01.40]I will- Hold on.
[292:03.80]I'm gonna quit.
[292:04.51]That doesn't mean I'm gonna- I'm gonna watch Luigi beat it for me.
[292:23.08]Oh, I need a record button and a down button!
[292:29.52]Alright, I quit.
[292:48.69]Cigarettes.
[292:49.15]I'm not gonna smoke them anymore.
[292:53.19]That's what I meant.
[292:54.09]Today's the day.
[293:02.33]Save me, snake block.
[293:03.55]Sure.
[293:06.37]Need to find novel ways to use the snake block.
[293:08.27]Ooh, this is gonna be fun.
[293:18.40]Do you actually smoke?
[293:20.28]No.
[293:22.58]I'm
[293:26.00]Did you just... No.
[293:27.24]No.
[293:27.64]Because of, you know, obviously... No, I don't.
[293:29.96]I do not.
[293:35.52]You know, if it were me playing the game right now, I would have jumped and freaked out like five times.
[293:42.30]But sometimes, you just have a confidence boost here that you can do anything.
[293:50.76]For instance, I can do anything.
[293:58.21]I can do anything I don't even need to look I wasn't aware you could get crushed On the top of the screen I didn't know the screen had a skybox
[294:37.78]And why did it kill me?
[294:39.14]Because the screen goes up.
[294:41.30]What?
[295:08.29]Can one of these Mario video game historians tell me why that happened?
[295:13.03]That's going too fast.
[295:19.70]Gotta keep up.
[295:23.50]Come on!
[295:24.98]I'm moving fast as the screen is going!
[295:28.00]Oh shit!
[295:46.61]Two more!
[295:47.27]63% Can almost do the other side With a land on the dark level
[296:09.69]Pitch black underground.
[296:16.18]This one's going to be a blast.
[296:24.28]Change the elephant?
[296:25.16]The elephant is only for my Mii, isn't it?
[296:26.68]Plus, I don't want to lose my... Wait.
[296:37.42]What?
[296:38.96]I...
[296:41.93]Okay.
[296:42.45]I thought I could... jump on it?
[296:50.24]Where's it... does it keep going?
[297:07.76]You just be the light.
[297:08.66]You go forward.
[297:11.92]How did I not get any of those cro- I don't know.
[297:18.39]Was this something I was supposed to get?
[297:23.73]Oh my god.
[297:24.42]Oh yeah.
[297:41.58]Let's go!
[298:10.90]Thanks for the help, Luigi.
[298:25.65]Did I run out of these or something?
[298:26.71]How do I delete them?
[298:38.33]Can I delete them?
[298:47.02]I hate this.
[298:57.81]I'm just gonna take it slow.
[299:03.07]The P is just the light.
[299:04.13]It's no other purpose.
[299:18.57]I just gotta let it go forward.
[299:36.79]I'm leaning back in my chair.
[299:37.61]That's bad.
[299:37.97]I gotta get up.
[299:52.32]Okay, follow the P. And prepare for that shit.
[300:11.02]But how do I get those?
[300:13.36]I'm missing some of the cool secrets.
[300:18.86]Oh, was it 50?
[300:20.12]Is it 50?
[300:20.56]Can you tell?
[300:21.96]Is it 50?
[300:22.82]It's 30.
[300:26.70]Can I stand on those?
[300:35.38]Holy fuck!
[300:36.60]I was looking!
[300:38.72]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[300:40.22]I thought I... I am so dumb.
[300:42.60]I was looking at chat.
[300:49.64]I thought it was going to just take me the whole way around.
[300:57.25]Um...
[301:21.42]50.
[301:21.44]How do I get that 50?
[301:27.19]I can go.
[301:27.61]I can ride that POW.
[301:32.99]Where's the rest of that?
[301:33.93]I need the POW to be over here.
[301:41.22]Ride.
[301:42.26]I think I have to jump.
[301:46.50]Holy shit.
[301:47.76]Be careful.
[301:57.99]It's up.
[302:00.55]Okay, what did that do?
[302:01.37]Anything for me?
[302:05.15]Not really.
[302:07.71]What if I hit the pot?
[302:09.68]Will that get the coin?
[302:18.06]No.
[302:24.32]I made it.
[302:25.91]I didn't get the 30 coins, though.
[302:42.72]One more.
[302:44.08]It fell down.
[302:45.02]Oh, shit.
[302:57.03]Bouncing through the clouds.

[303:05.80]Gotta get 40!
[303:06.28]There's no time.
[303:25.27]With the quickness.
[303:25.97]With the swiftness there.

[303:37.32]And there it is.
[303:38.70]And there it goes.
[303:39.68]And see you later.
[304:01.69]I'm just gonna pay attention to where the bullets are.
[304:04.96]Nothing else.

[308:29.17]Well, I do, but... Hurry up and get it!
[308:47.66]Mario is such a stressful game.
[308:50.76]It just is.
[308:53.22]The flag was right here.
[309:06.12]This should be relaxing.
[309:07.96]You know, it's weird because it's 50% relaxing, 50% build the castle.
[309:15.80]I just want to build it.
[309:17.36]I kind of don't care about anything else.
[309:24.75]Platforms really are stressful.
[309:26.13]Change my mind.
[309:26.85]I don't think I have to change your mind.
[309:30.36]I think I probably agree with you.
[309:33.50]We've got a couple of relaxing ones ahead of us, though.
[309:35.38]Master the trees.
[309:36.12]We just have to climb some trees.
[309:38.72]Reach the goal after doing a handstand on all the trees.
[309:40.94]This is a one star.
[309:44.49]What time is the movie night tomorrow?
[309:45.77]Same time as the regular stream.
[309:48.69]By the way, if you have not gotten a submission in, and you want to, make sure you get it in by tonight.
[309:56.37]Because if you get it in by tomorrow morning, afternoon, Pacific, it's going to be hard to add you to the list.
[310:01.83]Oh, I forgot to change the outfit.
[310:07.33]We'll do it after this.
[310:09.15]Never mind.
[310:11.13]I guess we're doing it now.
[310:14.56]And remember that this tomorrow is not a contest.
[310:18.56]We're just picking some of the... I guess we're gonna... There's like a... Basically a net to try to catch some of the higher quality submissions.
[310:32.09]No, hold on.
[310:33.89]I'm gonna get you.
[310:34.71]Can I like push him off the edge?
[310:49.93]Where do you submit?
[310:50.85]There's a Google Form.
[310:52.35]Only submit one video.
[310:54.43]I don't know if we can get the Google Form linked.
[310:59.15]Somebody has it somewhere.
[311:03.62]I wonder if somebody has it somewhere.
[311:10.21]And it has to include video footage from the green screen screen.
[311:14.63]Or from the green screen itself.
[311:16.59]You can't just, you know... You can't just submit... I'm not gonna say it because somebody will.
[311:22.95]So, just make sure it's green screen only.
[311:25.57]GI, hold on.
[311:38.56]Were you running into this?
[311:43.12]What am I talking about?
[311:43.88]So, six months ago or so, we did a green screen movie night where I went in front of the green screen and recorded like six or seven hours worth of stuff.
[311:55.11]And then the community came together and made a bunch of random stuff that was the green screen movie night.
[312:00.99]There were hundreds and hundreds of videos that we watched.
[312:08.53]And people thought it was a lot of fun, so for the longest time I've wanted to do another one, which is not as long as the first one.
[312:18.81]And that's what tomorrow night is.
[312:30.38]That dive kick is freaking me out.
[312:47.52]Am I gonna get bounced around here until I die?
[312:50.34]Oh my god!
[312:58.16]Jeremy.
[313:05.09]Turn up my mic.
[313:07.59]What's wrong with my mic?
[313:09.03]Is my mic low?
[313:18.23]It looks fine over here.
[313:26.45]On my end, it looks like everything's fine.
[313:29.69]I don't know.
[313:30.00]That's weird.
[313:30.38]Maybe when I got really loud, it just fucked up for some reason.
[313:38.84]Alright, outfit.
[313:39.42]No, no, no.
[313:39.84]Outfit, outfit, outfit, outfit.
[313:42.36]It's hard to hear me.
[313:46.64]I swear to God, there's some weird thing how this pulls in through OBS and pushes out.
[313:51.30]Because over on my... Over on my OBS, it looks like I'm about to peak every single sentence I say.
[314:01.60]It's strange.
[314:02.52]I'm at like just about like minus 8 dB.
[314:06.84]Or minus like 5.
[314:08.16]Like into the red.
[314:09.55]So that's weird.
[314:11.41]I get that a lot though.
[314:13.05]It's definitely not just one person.
[314:18.36]So don't ask me why it's like that.
[314:21.24]I'll dial myself up a little bit here.
[314:22.56]Alright, so where do I go to do this stuff?
[314:28.26]Back to the title?
[314:29.22]Notifications, settings, play guide, back to title?
[314:32.73]Like, where would I do this?
[314:45.71]Watch me lose all that progress.
[314:51.53]Okay, play, right?
[314:56.11]Course world?
[315:00.36]My stream's always relatively quiet.
[315:02.52]I wonder why.
[315:05.34]There I am.
[315:07.62]Doing the Charlie Brown dance.
[315:10.68]Change outfit.
[315:15.02]I got some new hats.
[315:15.64]Where are they?
[315:19.27]Where are they?
[315:20.77]I got another one, didn't I?
[315:26.41]Oh, it's weirdly spaced.
[315:29.16]Ooh!
[315:30.96]I have an animated hoodie?
[315:31.94]Is that for pre-ordering the game or something?
[315:37.38]I like this one.
[315:44.51]And what's the full suit?
[315:48.17]Oh, it's the dress.
[315:51.65]Okay.
[315:55.04]I like the Cookie Monster, though.
[316:07.32]There we go.
[316:07.78]Hyped.
[316:09.16]That's how... I'm always just so hyped, right?
[316:13.70]That's usually... What?
[316:14.36]Change face?
[316:15.02]No.
[316:19.98]Alright, I'm not ready for this yet.
[316:21.10]I'm still building the house.
[316:34.64]Upside down stretches.
[316:43.23]I think my life would be better if I didn't watch Jerma.
[316:50.21]well I that's a I mean that's like a that's a that's a you thing I I don't know what to tell you about and I just jumped off the edge because I'm just trying to I'm reading I'd probably get more done to be honest I don't know anywhere don't go anywhere just yet hold on a second here
[317:17.26]What about those funny tuber moments?
[317:18.78]What if you missed those?
[317:19.85]Alright, I'm done.
[317:21.63]Not with the game, but just with what I was doing.
[317:23.27]No, I'm not.
[317:23.73]I'm going to keep going.
[317:24.69]What about those funny tuber moments?
[317:27.39]You might miss those if you didn't hang out.
[317:34.60]Why hasn't Luigi decided to help me?
[317:36.90]In a long time.
[317:53.63]He blocked him.
[317:56.51]No, he blocked me.
[318:03.07]Why did I just... How do I rate this level?
[318:07.85]I want to give it a one star.
[318:15.33]He's doing his own shit and living his own life.
[318:31.24]Alright, any buttons to press?
[318:32.52]No.
[318:42.13]Don't kill me.
[318:46.25]They worked hard on this.
[318:47.07]How could you say that?
[318:49.27]Yeah, I worked hard on my birdhouse and people told me that I was stupid and it sucked.
[318:54.07]Are we gonna... Do we have a couple of different standards here?
[318:56.75]Is that what I understand?
[319:13.27]Careful.
[319:13.71]Careful.
[319:15.71]I can't go up there.
[319:20.26]How am I going to get away from that?
[319:32.25]Alright, I'm good.
[319:35.37]Watch out.
[319:35.91]The one dude there is just kind of hanging out.
[319:38.03]This is messing up my head here.
[319:41.38]This is screwing with my brain.
[319:43.06]I have to get rid of that thing.
[319:43.86]There we go.
[319:56.96]Alright, I got through that.
[319:59.76]Get rid of this snot ghost.
[320:03.26]Okay.
[320:07.00]Almost there.
[320:09.81]Cock strikes again.
[320:11.79]Yeah, unfortunately they tend to do that.
[320:13.53]I have to get a running start.
[320:20.05]Jesus, be careful.
[320:30.04]Fuck.
[320:30.38]Okay, hold on.
[320:30.98]How can I get that?
[320:37.37]This is bad.
[320:37.97]This is going to be bad, right?
[320:40.75]Can I fall and then go to the right?
[320:42.05]Yeah, I need the left.
[320:58.18]No flag either.
[321:07.88]That was close.
[321:08.60]You're right.
[321:08.86]That was a close one.
[321:09.46]Get all the coins.
[321:20.06]Oh, shit.
[321:23.28]No, that's not okay.
[321:25.25]That's not good.
[321:27.99]I can do the whole thing again.
[321:34.21]No, I did have a flag.
[321:35.51]I did.
[321:36.61]Why does it feel so far away?
[321:47.14]Oh no, that's not okay!
[321:52.91]Did I die in Mario Maker, or did I, like, rear-end somebody?
[321:57.42]In traffic.
[321:58.96]Oh!
[321:59.22]No, that's not okay!
[321:59.88]That's not okay!
[322:00.68]Oh no!
[322:18.73]Alright, I gotta get this again.
[322:19.75]Alright.
[322:35.07]Luigi is adamant on giving me parts here.
[322:37.77]For some reason.
[322:39.81]He's like, are you sure you don't want these?
[322:50.46]You sure?
[322:51.10]You're probably gonna need them.
[322:58.16]Just jump over everybody.
[322:59.12]Alright, so can I... Um... Just flip it upside down again.
[323:12.25]Or right side up, should I say.
[323:17.71]Oh.
[323:18.09]Oh well.
[323:24.60]The audio's delayed again?
[323:25.68]I don't know what it is with this thing.
[323:38.92]Why is everybody doing -2?
[323:43.54]I didn't do anything.
[323:44.68]Alright, ready?
[323:50.11]One.
[323:50.81]Two.
[323:51.89]One.
[323:52.83]Two.
[324:00.04]I don't know.
[324:01.90]What?
[324:02.70]I didn't... I didn't... People are abusing that now.
[324:07.59]I'm seeing some abuse on that system.
[324:25.66]You said right side up.
[324:27.18]I just had a slip.
[324:28.74]I just... I wasn't... I just... Whatever.
[324:32.31]I don't even... I'm dead.
[324:36.17]I'm dead.
[324:36.43]I'm dead.
[324:36.81]I'm gonna die.
[324:37.51]I'm dead.
[324:39.05]Alright.
[324:54.51]Float me over there.
[324:57.14]You gotta watch out for when the little things pop.
[325:00.73]Pop.
[325:01.75]It's over the coins.
[325:04.07]What does this do for me?
[325:09.43]Nothing?
[325:10.91]Um, do I need to go in that?
[325:11.97]Oh, look at that.
[325:13.45]Did you see that hitbox?
[325:16.20]I did, and it was bad.
[325:17.20]I couldn't even believe it.
[325:23.02]Why is this... He's like, I've got a back problem now.
[325:26.89]There are too many people standing on this, and I'm too panicky to get rid of them all.
[325:32.63]Now they've... It's like just rolling the dice.
[325:47.35]Nobody can do that.
[325:48.81]Nobody can effectively do that.
[325:51.39]If you do something like that, you jump on a shell that's in that small quarters, just throw dice in the air.
[326:10.30]Oh.
[326:11.66]Oh.
[326:11.82]Oh.
[326:16.19]What?
[326:16.39]Oh, it was blocked.
[326:31.56]This one's kinda hard.
[326:34.69]I would just stay in the middle, but you can't really do that either.
[326:36.57]Oh, fuck.
[326:49.44]Greed!
[326:57.18]Tilt it up?
[326:58.90]Oh shit, now it's gonna be down.
[327:02.16]Not that far down.
[327:12.42]Yeah, I've been streaming this for like five and a half hours.
[327:14.72]I haven't even asked the question yet.
[327:16.86]So, are these levels levels that were made by Nintendo teams, or were they brought over from the first game?
[327:25.59]Or are these just, hey, take a look at what you can do, and what you're capable of, and they got on.
[327:37.92]Made by Nintendo.
[327:45.00]Showing some of the new features and stuff.
[327:46.16]That's cool.
[327:47.94]Half of these mechanics were not even in Mario Maker 1.
[327:50.14]That makes sense.
[328:07.05]Cool.
[328:09.44]What's left to build?
[328:10.32]You know what I mean?
[328:14.92]How much left of the castle is there to do?
[328:21.43]New building options.
[328:22.33]What is next?
[328:24.27]East Hall Cannon, East Hall Doors.
[328:33.84]And what?
[328:35.12]The red carpet?
[328:35.70]What?
[328:41.92]Watch it turn around and you only do the front side of the castle.
[328:45.45]Let's just cut in half and I have to do the back.
[328:47.07]Let's do another job.
[328:54.90]Ant Trooper March.
[328:55.92]Then I've done these somehow already.
[328:58.14]A bunch of them.
[329:00.80]Let's clean up Ant Trooper March.
[329:03.97]Hope you like to use Y. Good luck.
[329:16.46]Why?
[329:16.74]That's run.
[329:17.92]Or dash.
[329:22.54]Good music, boys and girls!
[329:23.80]Oh, never mind.
[329:27.36]Holy fuck, this is fast.
[329:40.15]That's really fast.
[329:41.61]They ramped that up real quick.
[329:42.75]It starts off like this and then they just drag the screen over.
[330:00.29]Get out of here, Luigi.
[330:01.41]I'm gonna let Luigi do the last level.
[330:05.47]Just get in.
[330:06.02]I don't... I have to get over this.
[330:07.52]Kind of not fair.
[330:13.28]He's holding down.
[330:21.68]Oh, shit!
[330:27.77]It's too fast!
[330:50.06]Mario, I wish you wouldn't just grab onto ledges.
[330:58.75]Like that.
[330:59.17]Stop grabbing onto ledges.
[331:02.29]And hit the...
[331:06.07]He just bounced twice on his butt.
[331:09.03]He didn't even slide, he bounced.
[331:10.51]I died in the glass.
[331:21.67]You should be safe in the glass.
[331:23.11]You should be able to die in the glass.
[331:24.47]I even followed their instructions too.
[331:51.70]What's after that?
[331:52.42]Perfect.
[331:54.12]Sweet.
[331:54.36]That was really short.
[332:21.79]A lot of money for not a lot of time.
[332:28.49]75.
[332:29.43]Almost there.
[332:30.43]The castle's almost done.
[332:34.25]We're so close.
[332:36.32]Fly-by-night clown car.
[332:38.98]It's another one of those fly-around-and-shoot-things levels.
[332:42.40]Alright, gotta kill Bowser.
[332:52.85]Should be easy enough.
[333:00.21]I blew it.
[333:01.17]Oh, I want to restart just to do it again.
[333:05.42]Oh, best song.
[333:06.48]Again.
[333:16.06]One Bowser's.
[333:22.34]Triple shot.
[333:26.24]Let me get a good pace here.
[333:36.54]I should have gotten hit there.
[333:39.22]Some miraculous way I did not receive damage.
[333:47.34]Already time to go.
[333:52.88]Do I have to play the panic music on me?
[334:03.42]What is that?
[334:03.96]He's dead?
[334:20.85]One Bowser's?
[334:23.30]Good.
[334:27.99]I'm just playing Cuphead.
[334:29.59]Speaking of Cuphead, when does the new Cuphead stuff come out?
[334:33.71]This DLC that's primed.
[334:35.43]Soon here, right?
[334:35.91]Is there going to be one real answer in this?
[334:56.44]I guess not.
[334:59.34]The doors and the cannon.
[335:03.13]And that's all there is left.
[335:06.19]You know, there's probably like a cherry you put on top or like a whipped cream or something.
[335:17.90]No date set, just sometime in 2019.
[335:19.08]Cool.
[335:21.14]I will be into that.
[335:23.15]Lava Rising, 3 stars.
[335:24.29]200 bucks.
[335:26.13]Don't even need to read the description, because I know what it is.
[335:36.87]There's just some finesse work to do after this.
[335:44.45]Yeah, I want to try the multiplayer, too.
[335:48.00]Once it's not Day 1...
[335:51.40]I would put some time into this.
[335:54.58]The reason why I wanted to do the single player first is because last time I jumped right into expert levels and I wanted to quit the game forever.
[336:00.63]And I did.
[336:00.99]That's close.
[336:08.14]I'd like to get back into the groove of playing a Mario game before I do the hardest levels I can possibly imagine.
[336:20.37]That weighs more.
[336:22.47]What should I do?
[336:23.45]Oh my god, the lava comes up.
[336:24.77]Right.
[336:25.33]Shoot, shoot, shoot.
[336:33.83]What's that?
[336:39.39]Someone link the I Quit clip from a...
[336:45.72]I did not think that was going to go that fast.
[336:56.15]Oh, yeah.
[337:00.77]Was there an actual I quit moment?
[337:02.91]No, there wasn't.
[337:04.05]That's real.
[337:04.51]Hold on.
[337:13.87]No, no, no, no.
[337:14.61]I'm talking from like two years ago.
[337:37.25]Dude, this is the wall.
[337:39.43]Here comes the wall.
[337:41.65]This is the wall.
[337:42.41]I'm at like 77% where I made it to the gear check.
[338:02.66]Holy fuck!
[338:03.58]Does it go down?
[338:12.30]Don't leave me behind here.
[338:15.57]Oh my god!
[338:16.31]Oh no!
[338:17.97]I was on it!
[338:22.36]No, I have to do the whole fucking thing again!
[338:37.14]It's just a line on the screen.
[338:38.76]It's a loading screen.
[338:40.42]You're not even going to have Luigi actually do something?
[338:49.90]They just let you win.
[338:52.34]There's nothing else.
[338:55.84]And it's an actual just full-on win.
[339:02.65]Uh... Okay.
[339:05.53]Well...
[339:07.15]Oh, but look what they do to you, though.
[339:09.90]They put a Luigi flag on it, just to remind you forever.
[339:14.98]I'll go back and do it as Mario.
[339:19.43]Thwops and Chain Chomps in Passable Castle.
[339:24.01]Pick up Buzzy Shells with Y and wear them.
[339:27.35]But that ain't gonna happen.
[339:42.91]I got a lot of gas in my upper GI tract.
[339:45.21]It won't come out.
[339:46.32]I want to burp, but I feel like if I burp too hard, if I try, I'll throw up.
[339:49.02]You know what I'm saying?
[339:51.78]You guys have been there before?
[339:52.44]Okay.
[340:08.16]Too much information?
[340:10.18]I gave you barely any information there, actually.
[340:13.49]I could have been way more explicit.
[340:21.83]How do I get you up there?
[340:22.63]You don't want to come up here?
[340:39.23]Oh god, just do it!
[340:40.01]Just do it!
[340:40.37]Just go!
[340:40.67]Just do it!
[340:41.09]Relax.
[340:54.56]I know.
[340:54.82]I know.
[340:56.58]I don't know if I should have done that.
[341:07.52]I definitely should not have done that, but...
[341:15.28]What?
[341:17.34]Get the flag.
[341:18.18]Forget about the coins.
[341:18.84]They're not important.
[341:24.64]Hmm.
[341:32.13]I could bump it up, but I don't have the helmet anymore.
[341:34.05]Ooh.
[341:42.04]Why?
[341:42.30]That's fantastic.
[341:44.89]It ends all the way over there.
[341:45.87]Great.
[341:54.37]Give it to me!
[342:00.66]Come on back.
[342:07.74]Big enough to get it.
[342:10.44]I think I have to kill Bowser with the guy's face.
[342:14.52]This is gonna be annoying.
[342:21.03]You can't go through here, can you?
[342:33.58]I can still hear him.
[342:44.84]Got him.
[342:51.95]Easier than I thought.
[342:52.51]I thought I had to get him hit by the thwomps.
[342:57.00]But apparently not.
[342:57.74]Just had to hit the axe.
[342:58.46]650... 665th?
[343:01.34]665th.
[343:01.40]I can't even talk.
[343:18.41]83.
[343:19.51]Any more jobs?
[343:21.05]So what happens when we finish this?
[343:22.65]I still have like 20 levels left to do.
[343:25.44]Lava bubble limbo.
[343:30.68]Created an ocean of lava bubbles, but now I can't get through it.
[343:33.82]Get through, I'll pay you.
[343:43.06]I don't remember Peach's Castle having artillery.
[343:50.02]Is that a new thing?
[343:50.94]That's a new development?
[344:01.38]So what's the deal here?
[344:02.52]I just have to... swim with this?
[344:08.46]Just get through it, but get through what?
[344:24.03]Fly a flower.
[344:24.77]Nice.
[344:27.70]I just have to swim with them.
[344:28.68]Okay, well... Easy enough.
[344:42.79]That fish was freaking me out.
[344:45.66]Alright, so I made it.
[344:46.36]Now that they get bigger, I get it.
[344:49.72]They just make it more annoying to have to weed through.
[344:59.01]I really should be more in front.
[345:01.49]I was dilly-dallying too much.
[345:03.82]Not gonna be good.
[345:19.21]Double bounce, that was good Wasn't that bad It was pretty easy Help, I can't hold my breath anymore
[345:43.00]We'll stop doing that.
[345:44.67]You don't have to do that to impress me.
[345:45.87]You don't have to do that.
[345:50.77]Let it go.
[345:51.13]I was still building the castle.
[345:54.73]We are... I think we're done.
[345:57.51]I think there's just finishing touches.
[345:59.45]Because we're... What else is there to build?
[346:04.56]You got something else for me?
[346:06.76]Mario, you're making great progress.
[346:08.00]I need a new word to describe how great this new section is.
[346:10.12]How about Splendorific Camazarivalus?
[346:15.58]We have a new building option.
[346:18.61]Oh, the roof.
[346:19.43]The roof of the East Hall.
[346:21.05]Okay.
[346:23.13]Alright.
[346:25.81]Okay, that's fine.
[346:29.21]Dry Bones Lava Lurker.
[346:32.58]Reach the goal after defeating all the Dry Bones.
[346:44.27]I'll hold my breath for... Let's see.
[346:46.05]Is there water in this one?
[346:51.63]Well, there's lava.
[346:56.29]They're collecting taxes from the residents of Mushroom Kingdom.
[347:00.33]That doesn't sound nice.
[347:02.95]Why would I collect taxes from them?
[347:04.51]It's not like King Mario and like Queen... Alright, you know what?
[347:11.91]Who's the queen?
[347:16.74]There is no king and queen.
[347:18.04]Why is there a princess?
[347:19.80]And is there a prince?
[347:27.31]Does it drop?
[347:45.87]Don't get it yet?
[347:46.35]Oh, well.
[347:52.27]The Mushroom Kingdom is a principality.
[347:55.21]Bowser is the king.
[347:57.41]Bowser is not the king.
[348:05.62]Who are all the toads?
[348:07.84]Are they, like, are they supposed to be, you know, servants of the castle?
[348:11.97]Butlers?
[348:13.35]But where is the king and queen?
[348:31.35]There isn't one.
[348:36.09]Whose goddamn castle is this?
[348:41.87]Princess Toadstool.
[348:43.58]But who was before Princess Toadstool?
[349:00.10]Blinking Block Blitz.
[349:01.68]Two stars.
[349:02.16]There's a plumber in a non-toileted society and you're upset about the missing monarchy.
[349:23.65]It's definitely toilets.
[349:29.66]There's definitely toilets.
[349:37.13]We're about to install them.
[349:51.26]I hate cat Mario.
[349:52.66]I don't like it at all.
[350:08.60]Where's Dog Mario?
[350:13.23]Am I already losing time?
[350:22.83]Get in there.
[350:23.39]I'm gonna get inside.
[350:27.77]Ready?
[350:27.97]One, two, three, click.
[350:34.69]Stop doing like the M. Bison move!
[350:41.30]I hate the cat.
[350:41.88]I don't like the cat.
[350:42.44]I don't like the cat.
[350:43.14]I hate the cat.
[350:46.41]I'm not gonna pick the power-up app.
[350:47.81]I'm just gonna do the level without the cat.
[351:12.94]Alright, I'm good.
[351:19.21]I want that 10 bucks.
[351:24.12]Just give me the... Give it to me.
[351:52.74]Where's the flag?!
[351:53.44]Stupid fucking cat.
[352:10.12]Dumb cat levels.
[352:11.44]Stone level are better than cat levels.
[352:22.71]I wasn't supposed to pick that up.
[352:26.67]No, and you attach to every single fucking wall.
[352:36.82]I don't want to grab every wall, Mario.
[352:52.39]I tried to grab the tree!
[353:00.68]I hate this character.
[353:02.22]I hate it.
[353:07.22]I'm going to lose again.
[353:08.34]No, I'm not.
[353:09.12]I'm throwing off.
[353:10.64]I'm getting the costume off.
[353:13.50]I just want to... Oh, my God.
[353:15.29]It's the costume.
[353:16.17]It's the... Peter, it's the goblin.
[353:18.99]It's the goblin.
[353:21.37]I swear to God, I... I never want to see this stupid fucking Garfield-looking shithead ever again.
[353:57.26]Yeah, you can do yoga.
[353:58.16]Great.
[353:58.68]Get in there.
[354:11.82]You're as mad at Mario as I got with Uncharted on crushing.
[354:15.94]What's that mean?
[354:32.44]And dive bomb.
[354:36.12]Rotten pro... Are there a use for the dive bomb?
[354:41.26]No.
[354:43.22]What's it there for?
[354:54.54]Let's go eat some rotten mushrooms.
[355:01.69]Getting mad at Uncharted.
[355:04.81]I've never played Uncharted.
[355:05.77]Is that possible?
[355:11.24]No mis... Stakes.
[355:17.44]No mistakes.
[355:17.92]Here we go.
[355:18.24]I'm going to do a first try.
[355:18.90]I'm going to get everything perfect.
[355:19.82]Every coin.
[355:20.18]Go.
[355:28.17]Since when do mushrooms go to the left side?
[355:29.81]It's never happened.
[355:33.53]Going to the left
[356:07.71]I was on it!
[356:12.99]I missed coins, who cares.
[356:39.04]Joe Rogan ran?
[356:42.42]Oh, okay.
[356:43.94]Mushrooms.
[356:48.28]88.
[356:48.96]88%.
[356:49.96]We are so damn close.
[356:52.24]I can feel it.
[356:55.65]Koopa Clown Car Coin Collecting.
[356:59.15]Reach the goal after grabbing all 50 coins.
[357:01.67]This will get us to 90%.
[357:08.22]Alright, I'm gonna calm down now and... I'm gonna just relax and we're just gonna play.
[357:15.29]Alright.
[357:29.80]It's not working.
[358:08.85]Where did this come from?
[358:15.51]Where did that come from?
[358:17.61]Why is a mushroom in one?
[358:19.66]No, no, get back in.
[358:21.70]Okay, seriously.
[358:32.68]I have 25 seconds.
[358:36.00]Ooh, get those.
[358:36.64]No, don't.
[358:37.12]It doesn't matter.
[358:38.12]Can I break this?
[358:40.70]I have 17 seconds.
[358:41.64]I gotta get all the other ones.
[358:42.47]Little stragglers.
[358:47.19]37... 30, 39, 40.
[358:49.23]Okay, 7 seconds.
[358:50.55]You gotta blow this up right now, man.
[358:51.75]Come on.
[358:53.21]You're gonna take this out right now.
[358:54.18]Blow it up.
[358:54.50]Blow it up.
[358:54.80]Please.
[358:55.24]Please!
[359:05.58]What do you mean jump?
[359:06.28]Jump?
[359:09.00]Now I know what to do.
[359:15.38]Oh, because I put... I... That... I can break them.
[359:19.05]I didn't... Right.
[359:20.15]Whatever.
[359:21.11]Oh.
[359:21.57]Upset.
[359:22.13]Irritated.
[359:23.01]Not happy.
[359:24.05]Mad.
[359:25.63]No, calm down.
[359:26.23]Everything's fine.
[359:28.23]Oh, this is like a Twitch chat.
[359:29.45]Twitch integration.
[359:30.19]You guys just gave me a mushroom.
[359:31.35]I see how it works.
[360:05.88]44, 45, 69, 29, where's the last one?
[360:09.36]That's it, good.
[360:11.55]You can now leave.
[360:21.75]Oh my god, no!
[360:23.23]Oh no, no!
[360:26.63]Can't touch it!
[360:27.95]Grab it!
[360:29.71]I was trying to jump on his head so I could go in the- yeah.
[360:44.98]Damn, he really is bad at this.
[360:46.36]No, I just jumped over it and I was trying to... 90%.
[360:57.12]The darkness lifts.
[360:59.62]Use a dim light to make... Get over it.
[361:03.43]Wall jumps are great.
[361:06.43]Get over it.
[361:09.07]If you mess up, you'll fall into a lake of boiling poison.
[361:16.53]This haha I suck at a kid's game joke isn't funny.
[361:21.67]Mario's no joke.
[361:25.23]Mario does not mess around.
[361:29.49]These games are made with skill in mind.
[361:31.66]Um, okay.
[361:42.50]I have just barely saved my life.
[361:45.44]I'm gonna wait until the last second.
[361:47.08]Into the claw.
[361:58.25]Oh my god!
[361:59.03]Okay.
[362:12.59]Not in the poison.
[362:13.72]Easy.
[362:20.70]Where the hell is... They did say wall jumping.
[362:25.83]So that's what you have to do.
[362:27.77]I am not going to go on the other side of that.
[362:31.29]30 coins, someone else will get them.
[362:34.73]When you load up your copy, you can go on the other side and get that.
[362:37.81]What is going on?
[362:43.30]Does it go back up?
[362:56.79]No.
[363:03.29]Ah, shit.
[363:07.81]Alright, that was tricky, but not that bad.
[363:11.21]Not that bad.
[363:20.18]I'm still going to have money.
[363:21.52]What's the point of money after you build everything?
[363:23.19]Because I think that's it.
[363:25.87]Unless there's some other random stuff that is possible.
[363:28.53]I don't know what to do with the money.
[363:29.71]91. 91.
[363:37.11]Oh, everyone's stressed.
[363:38.77]That means that something's wrong.
[363:41.03]Oh, man.
[363:41.61]Oh, this is bad.
[363:43.17]Big red, we got a problem.
[363:45.41]I shouldn't say this out loud, so here.
[363:47.05]Ooh, total eclipse.
[363:51.63]I can't believe it.
[363:52.35]Every last member of the crew was kidnapped during lunch.
[363:56.49]Please, you've got to go and rescue them all before the chief notices and docks our pay.
[364:00.91]Get all five toads.
[364:02.07]Ooh.
[364:12.83]I need every toad.
[364:20.63]I'm gonna go down left.
[364:22.27]No, I'm not.
[364:22.83]Down right.
[364:31.28]Who's over here?
[364:33.94]One!
[364:35.60]Uh, is there a secret toad?
[364:39.12]You know what I mean?
[364:41.09]I gotta get these toads, but is there a toad that is a secret toad?
[364:53.71]Well, now what do you do?
[364:54.71]You're trapped there.
[364:57.23]He was supposed to be a hero.
[364:59.47]He died fucking instantly.
[365:03.13]He didn't even know he died.
[365:04.45]It was horrible.
[365:07.18]It just seared his head off.
[365:16.47]Alright, up here.
[365:24.85]Alright, this time don't run.
[365:30.76]Don't rush.
[365:31.38]Holy crap.
[365:32.62]Holy crap.
[365:35.94]Where did that come from?
[365:40.32]My god, what the hell is happening in my brain?
[365:42.80]It's like the my brain is moving faster than things on the screen Oh
[366:17.66]Be nice.
[366:18.86]If I got one of these.
[366:19.68]Am I tall?
[366:27.89]I'm gonna, like, crush my head.
[366:33.93]Okay.
[366:35.13]Now, just walk across them.
[366:37.70]Slowly.
[366:41.38]Thank you.
[366:41.84]Toad number two.
[366:50.67]That leaves us with bottom left and top left.
[366:54.95]And then I got them all.
[366:57.15]What is this gonna do?
[366:59.73]Rush twice?
[367:03.50]Thank you for that.
[367:04.12]Appreciate it.
[367:08.64]Who died?
[367:10.64]Be faster next time.
[367:16.45]This doesn't hit us, right?
[367:29.03]One more.
[367:29.73]I need a... I need... I need... Mushroom.
[367:37.90]One.
[367:38.86]Two.
[367:39.76]Three.
[367:40.78]Four.
[367:41.74]Five.
[367:59.62]One, two, three, four.
[368:02.82]Sometimes I try to do a gotcha moment there where I jump up and it instantly turns back on.
[368:07.86]Got him all.
[368:08.64]Let's get the hell out of here.
[368:22.02]Wait, what?
[368:23.90]How do I get the hell out of here?
[368:32.04]Who did I miss?
[368:35.52]Who's still... Who did I not get?
[368:39.10]Didn't I already go down here?
[368:39.98]I remember, like, jumping over this.
[368:44.38]Did I not go this way?
[368:51.19]Oh, all the way to the right here.
[368:52.23]Oh, here you go.
[369:06.81]I just don't want him to get hurt.
[369:08.97]Oh god.
[369:12.91]Someone's gonna get just clubbed by one of those.
[369:15.09]30?
[369:21.96]That's a lot of coins.
[369:27.72]Alright, slow.
[369:37.49]This is like a seven minute level.
[369:38.93]I don't want to blow it.
[369:39.87]There's a boss at the end of this.
[369:43.67]That was way easier than... I thought I just dropped them all in there.
[369:58.46]Put on a facecam?
[370:00.15]Alright, fine.
[370:10.78]There.
[370:13.34]Hi.
[370:13.78]How are you?
[370:14.76]Good to see you.
[370:15.08]Let me move this down.
[370:29.83]Good.
[370:32.43]Old joke.
[370:33.15]Oh, it's because of this.
[370:33.89]Hold on.
[370:35.75]I don't care.
[370:36.11]I don't want to do it.
[370:43.27]They're all back.
[370:48.65]You rescued the toads.
[370:49.75]You did it.
[370:50.91]Congratulations.
[370:53.77]Now paint it.
[370:59.32]My crew finally came back.
[371:00.92]Was there a lazy toad convention in the bathroom or something?
[371:05.10]Confirmed bathrooms.
[371:08.38]Person that said that earlier.
[371:11.18]Mario's a plumber.
[371:14.64]Everything's done.
[371:18.32]We have new building options now.
[371:21.16]Stained glass.
[371:22.24]2000.
[371:22.88]Alright.
[371:24.02]So it is stained glass.
[371:27.37]That's the finishing touch.
[371:30.83]A bathroom without a toilet.
[371:38.29]Would it be a bathroom?
[371:39.93]I mean, I guess if it had bathtubs in it.
[371:50.33]This is expensive bullshit that requires completing everything.
[371:52.93]Well, I'm pretty close.
[372:04.58]The darkness is killing me.
[372:15.92]I just landed him.
[372:19.11]Holy shit, something just dropped.
[372:20.65]Oh man, alright, alright, slow down.
[372:35.04]I thought we were gonna keep going right.
[372:36.20]This is why I skipped this one.
[372:50.58]He sees ten coins and immediately beefs it.
[372:54.92]What was it immediately?
[373:03.55]I mean, to be fair, it is a pretty prize because you need the currency.
[373:09.07]Alright, coming back.
[373:17.15]I didn't try to get it.
[373:22.27]Is that going to come down?
[373:23.69]Holy shit, it is.
[373:24.72]I could have jumped and got it.
[373:34.76]How the hell?
[373:40.12]Shit.
[373:43.31]I hear something.
[373:44.95]What do I hear?
[373:45.51]I hear something.
[373:46.37]Oh my god, it's... Saws.
[373:54.92]50!
[373:58.42]Oh, I want it so bad!
[374:00.58]Nope.
[374:13.99]Luigi can have that 50, yeah.
[374:19.03]I missed a 50.
[374:20.07]It hurts to miss a 50, it does.
[374:22.15]Unfortunately.
[374:24.85]Angry, angry sun.
[374:29.07]Cloudy with a chance of gamma ray burst.
[374:31.50]I recommend using the cloud cover to avoid getting a nasty sunburn.
[374:37.48]Can you do facecam?
[374:38.28]Sure, I'll do it for a second.
[374:41.74]I'm not fixing the audio because it's going to take too long.
[375:02.18]Wait for the- wait, wait, wait.
[375:10.85]Alright, hold on.
[375:24.80]That's better.
[375:25.66]Hi.
[375:38.95]if I had just paid attention to the game.
[376:24.00]A hamster!
[376:43.43]I don't do cam, man.
[376:45.27]I don't do cam.
[376:46.55]I don't do cam, dude.
[376:48.67]Sorry.
[376:50.43]Alright.
[376:50.99]It's fucking with my brain.
[376:56.64]This is- this level's- just watch the sun.
[377:02.80]Just give it to me, please.
[377:04.96]Alright, relax.
[377:07.90]Bring it back, I want the- Why am I reading chat and walking off of a fucking cliff at the same time?
[377:14.75]What would the purpose of that be?
[377:20.37]Get out of here, you fucking Banjo-Kazooie-looking dick.
[377:35.77]That was uncalled for?
[377:36.51]Yeah, but where has he been, alright?
[377:39.73]Where has he been for 20 years?
[377:47.40]He walked out and didn't come back.
[377:51.38]Holy shit, I can still do it.
[377:56.34]Greed is killing me here.
[377:58.20]Greed is killing me.
[377:59.22]It killed me.
[378:02.41]Alright, face came on for this one.
[378:32.35]Got it.
[378:33.73]Watch out for the sun.
[378:36.81]Watch out for the sun.
[378:38.01]I'm thinking about getting the coins.
[378:48.70]Oh shit.
[378:55.82]Where's this going?
[379:07.21]The sun's just being annoying now.
[379:18.40]Get up there!
[379:23.02]Where the fuck did I go?
[379:24.20]Oh, I'm trying to jump to get the coins.
[379:28.86]Words first Martical... Marti... Marti... Vertical Mario MVP.
[379:46.64]Alright, get out of here.
[379:55.90]How much is left?
[379:59.29]There are a shitload of levels left.
[380:05.69]What happens when we build the castle?
[380:07.65]Reach the goal in the Koopa Troopa car.
[380:09.19]Let's go!
[380:18.75]Do multiplayer before it's too late.
[380:21.85]Well, it's not going to be too late because we're going to do it again.
[380:28.40]There's actually a car.
[380:30.90]How do I drive it?
[380:36.62]Holy, this is awesome.
[380:45.52]Imagine the levels that we'll get out of this.
[380:51.30]Somebody will recreate the whole track.
[380:55.70]I love this level.
[380:56.32]This is one of those levels in the original that just played itself.
[380:59.38]And it was, like, impossible to lose.
[381:00.62]You just had to drive.
[381:02.02]And let the show... Remember the songs?
[381:05.69]These are the best.
[381:11.69]Hey.
[381:11.95]You can go up or down.
[381:17.87]Right on top.
[381:21.30]that's a full letter grade up you're right if this was like a b minus so far like a b it's now an a although I don't know if I would classify this as a b minus it's just fun buzzy the movie the book the ride
[381:52.31]Reach the goal after grabbing 80 coins.
[381:54.79]Collect coins while trying not to fall to your doom.
[381:57.15]Once you grab Buzzy Beetle's shell, you can throw it up.
[382:01.87]Alright.
[382:12.76]Street Fighter the movie the game.
[382:14.32]Alright.
[382:15.94]Reach the goal after grabbing at least 80 coins.
[382:20.64]Let's go.
[382:32.50]What?
[382:35.96]Right.
[382:36.54]That's what it wants me to do.
[382:41.73]Thread the needle.
[382:44.93]Nice.
[382:45.09]Come on.
[382:45.29]Do it again.
[382:45.81]Idiot.
[382:48.30]Can I...
[382:59.41]What?
[383:04.42]Oh!
[383:04.88]I was staring at that 50.
[383:06.26]All I saw were dollar signs and nothing else.
[383:10.66]I really am like a money bug.
[383:13.16]It's like a light source.
[383:19.47]I just saw money and I was like, money, give it to me, money.
[383:29.30]I don't understand what the hell they want me to do.
[383:33.94]Thread it.
[383:36.44]Oh, shit.
[383:39.16]I... Alright.
[383:39.74]Yes, I'm alright.
[383:43.98]No, give me... I want to catch it.
[383:49.83]Here we go.
[383:52.81]Perfect.
[383:55.49]Get away from me.
[383:56.09]Did I do it?
[383:57.57]105.
[383:57.73]Yep.
[384:01.43]How do you get that 30 down there?
[384:07.15]What is up with that?
[384:08.23]What is going on here?
[384:13.82]What did it do?
[384:17.58]What did it do?
[384:18.02]What did that do?
[384:19.02]There's a door.
[384:22.02]Should I go in the door?
[384:25.21]Oh, no, that's the normal door.
[384:35.52]It stopped the Conveyor Belt.
[384:36.76]I have enough money.
[384:45.80]We got work to do.
[384:48.00]Now here's the thing.
[384:49.20]How this is possible to continue to... It's probably going to be ten plus hammers there.
[385:01.31]Only five.
[385:01.77]Never mind.
[385:06.35]Construction has started on the stained glass.
[385:09.49]Okay.
[385:09.83]And there's even more jobs to do here.
[385:16.53]Let's go all the way to the end for a second.
[385:17.91]19.
[385:19.95]No, we already did these.
[385:23.69]Here.
[385:26.13]Invincible Wind Sprinter is currently the last one we have here.
[385:30.45]100 coins under the sea.
[385:40.44]Grab all 100 coins.
[385:46.72]Do it?
[385:47.80]No, I'll do the last, like, couple.
[385:49.98]If they're still available and this kind of ends, you only have to do 60 or 70 levels.
[385:58.19]And I'll try some of the crazy ones.
[386:01.85]And then I'll do a multiplayer night.
[386:04.97]Where I'll play a bunch of levels and then do some multiplayer.
[386:09.52]Probably do that.
[386:10.56]Let's see what's today.
[386:12.02]Tomorrow's movie night.
[386:15.48]So, after tomorrow... I got... I want to do Dark Souls Randomizer, and then... Alright, I got a plan.
[386:26.21]We're going to do that... That got a lot lined up.
[386:31.89]Do I have to do this?
[386:35.16]I mean, you're talking about the single-player thing?
[386:36.98]No, not necessarily, but I think it's kind of fun.
[386:40.06]Plus, like I said before, I don't just want to jump into Mario Maker.
[386:43.63]I want to, like, just get some good hours in.
[386:48.19]Just doing the single-player, and then go hard on the multiplayer stuff.
[387:05.09]Want to do more Cook, Serve, Delicious?
[387:08.63]Whenever, really.
[387:12.05]Where is this taking me?
[387:26.72]Don't have a plan.
[387:29.96]Yeah, this is a relaxing level.
[387:32.84]After the weird ones.
[387:35.76]I'm probably going to do the enemies and items randomizer.
[387:40.68]It was heavily requested.
[387:43.74]Long ago.
[387:45.20]And seems like fun.
[387:47.13]So I'll probably do that.
[387:48.49]I don't know if I'm going to do it with any other person though.
[387:53.01]Doing that with two people is hard because if somebody dies, don't you have to restart everything and resummon them and stuff?
[388:03.40]I was going to just kind of do a night where I do a bunch of random weird ones.
[388:12.40]But yeah, that's next week.
[388:16.92]I'll probably do Tuesday, Wednesday.
[388:19.04]I got to work on that carnival shit though.
[388:24.34]I'm probably going to have like a meeting.
[388:27.80]I'll figure it out.
[388:38.87]The world's greatest cannon ride.
[388:40.27]That one is doing it for me.
[388:41.37]I want to try it.
[388:50.52]Termicorp board meeting.
[388:54.68]No.
[389:02.61]You see, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I'm doing right now.
[389:08.15]If I had...
[389:09.82]Remember Mario Maker 1?
[389:11.56]I couldn't even make small jumps.
[389:16.02]I'll be ready for the new levels in the multiplayer next time I do this.
[389:19.21]Come on, get out of the way.
[389:29.41]Psycho!
[389:50.96]Uh-oh.
[389:51.96]Didn't have a good view.
[389:59.98]Don't blow it right before the... Get up top.
[390:09.25]No, don't get up top.
[390:10.51]What do I do?
[390:10.91]Oh, here.
[390:11.33]How do I get that?
[390:19.70]Like this?
[390:29.64]I got greedy and it was a mistake!
[390:31.06]I turned it okay.
[390:34.62]So far.
[390:47.50]Don't die here.
[390:48.82]Whatever.
[390:54.26]Why do the bombs look so weird, do they?
[391:03.81]To anyone who bought Jerma stock during the Dread Hall stream three months ago, sell it for profit.
[391:07.68]Are you going to sell my stock before the carnival?
[391:13.80]I think that would be a mistake.
[391:24.94]What's the carnival?
[391:27.08]Oh yeah, that's right.
[391:28.84]I probably should talk about it more often.
[391:31.74]At some point in the end of August or somewhere into September, I'm currently working with a robotics team.
[391:38.36]And I'm making an entire Twitch controls carnival game stream.
[391:43.68]Dunk tanks, claw games.
[391:46.91]And it's happening at some point around September.
[391:55.17]How long is that stream going to be?
[391:56.27]It's going to be at least four to six hours long.
[392:00.91]Has to be.
[392:03.46]And I'll be on the dunk tank, yeah.
[392:07.82]This is a project that is a very, very long time in the making.
[392:11.49]I really wanted this to happen, like, back in, like, April or March, but... Kinda just didn't.
[392:18.29]But now it is.
[392:20.27]It's finally gonna happen.
[392:25.70]How many votes will it take to dunk you?
[392:27.66]Well, that's the thing.
[392:29.20]I don't really want to talk about it too much.
[392:32.10]Because I'd rather some of it, at least most of it, be a surprise.
[392:35.89]And more than just like, hey, here's everything that's going to happen.
[392:40.35]Because there's a lot of shit that's going to happen on that stream.
[392:45.85]That at least is planned to happen.
[392:48.72]So I'd rather not just be like, and here's this is going to happen, and this is going to happen, and this is what happened, and this is going to happen at the end.
[392:56.72]But I will tell you very specific dates, very specific times, weeks in advance, if not potentially a month in advance of when this stream is going to happen.
[393:11.85]How did I do that without... I was barely paying attention to that one.
[393:19.46]Million dollar joke.
[393:22.52]Not that much.
[393:25.89]But for those of you... I won't give... No, no, no, that's not... No, I don't want to do that.
[393:32.26]No, it's too early.
[393:32.98]Too early to talk about that.
[393:37.96]You'll see.
[393:38.94]You'll see.
[393:41.59]Uh-oh.
[393:44.61]10?
[393:45.01]Oh, I could have got it right there.
[394:02.50]Because they're going to be a clown.
[394:06.13]Just know this.
[394:09.37]That I'm going as hard as I possibly can on this string.
[394:16.64]I don't want to say anything else.
[394:18.32]That's all I really need to say.
[394:30.87]I can't have that just empty here.
[394:32.83]You know what I mean?
[394:33.41]I have to do it.
[394:33.93]Climbing Twister Cave.
[394:38.85]Do you ever feel nervous about doing big streams like that before them?
[394:51.72]No, not really.
[394:53.92]Because... It's just like that shit that I've... Oh, come on.
[394:57.91]I missed those.
[395:00.93]Because by the time that you see something on stream, I've probably gone over it a dozen times.
[395:07.45]I probably, like, talked about it or planned it for weeks in advance.
[395:12.60]So I want to do it, and I want to get going, and I want to do it now.
[395:15.46]You know what I mean?
[395:21.52]Usually, like, at least a week or two in advance, a lot of those, like, random streams like that that would happen.
[395:25.58]Oh, come on.
[395:25.98]I can get that.
[395:31.06]The people helping you actually know what you're doing.
[395:33.14]Oh, yeah, and they're very much included in Onboard.
[395:39.28]They're very excited about it, too.
[395:43.06]Because it's just... Hopefully, it's just going to be a really fun project to do.
[395:54.23]Really?
[395:54.45]You're going to come out like that?
[395:56.91]Well, do it again.
[396:04.57]That's not a good idea.
[396:05.55]Do it from here.
[396:08.09]It's 30 coins.
[396:08.73]I have to try.
[396:12.70]Jesus.
[396:13.16]I don't think I can make this jump from here.
[396:16.24]God damn it.
[396:16.76]I knew that was going to happen.
[396:22.40]Thank the people helping with this for us.
[396:25.36]Yeah, you will know...
[396:29.09]You'll know exactly who they are.
[396:30.59]Because this... This gonna... They'll be very... It'll be very evident on who is... I did it again.
[396:50.66]Because the people that are working on this... It's... They have... Like a legit... Mobile unit...
[397:01.92]You know, it's not, it's not like la- the last big, big, big project I did, which was, essentially, you could, it was, Shurima Rumble Live was the last huge project that I really, really, really did.
[397:12.41]That was me and, like, my friends and a couple other people.
[397:16.83]This is a bunch of people that do this kind of shit for a living.
[397:21.47]So, and it has to be that way, because there's a lot going on in this stream, that there has to be a lot of people essentially working on it.
[397:37.39]I gotta be careful.
[397:37.99]I have no health.
[397:38.71]And yes, I called it health, but that's kind of what it is.
[397:42.37]Am I gonna put an act on, or is it gonna be... I mean, it's kind of just gonna be me.
[397:50.30]Holy fuck, I thought that was an enemy.
[397:58.82]One, two, three, go.
[398:06.30]Don't do that.
[398:10.48]Get it.
[398:13.54]Really?
[398:13.94]I've been moving real quick, haven't I?
[398:15.64]I haven't been moving fast.
[398:21.37]How much more is there?
[398:23.55]Oh yeah, yay.
[398:26.49]No!
[398:28.85]He's killing everybody!
[398:29.71]Holy shit.
[398:42.21]At least I have the time back.
[398:47.03]Don't.
[398:54.12]B. Come on.
[398:54.68]Press B. Should I bring a bomb up there?
[398:58.90]I feel like that'll help.
[399:12.85]No, give me a new one.
[399:15.59]Don't!
[399:19.54]No, that's not gonna work.
[399:22.36]I needed that extra hit for this!
[399:26.50]He kind of just has to kill everything, otherwise I'll fly into him.
[399:35.06]I'll just leave one.
[399:36.26]I could probably go now.
[399:53.08]Okie dokie.
[399:59.24]One, two, three.
[400:13.69]Ugh.
[400:15.05]What happened to the courtroom stream that I mentioned on the podcast?
[400:19.49]We just couldn't get it done.
[400:22.07]It just wasn't gonna happen.
[400:23.61]We were in contact with a couple of different courts and a couple of different groups that wanted to kind of do it.
[400:30.40]But they flaked out.
[400:32.32]Both of them.
[400:33.48]Essentially, at the very last second, they were like, eh, stop returning emails and
[400:46.05]We were going to have... Santa's... Uh-oh, I'm taking down the fourth wall here.
[400:56.63]Meteor Showdown.
[400:57.43]Meowser Showdown.
[400:58.47]What the hell is this?
[401:02.14]The chief has been abducted by Bowser.
[401:03.74]Here's the last one.
[401:06.36]We need to go... It's only difficulty level three.
[401:10.20]We were going to have Santa's prosecutor was going to just sing all of his lines.
[401:16.31]And we had a guy that was perfect for it.
[401:23.08]There's gonna be Christmas music in the background while he sang all of his lines.
[401:28.69]There's gonna be character witnesses.
[401:30.17]It's gonna be ridiculous.
[401:34.47]Why?
[401:34.77]Well, because he's like Santa's magic fucking attorney.
[401:52.65]So, of course he's gonna be a Christmas spirit kind of thing.
[401:57.27]We had a lot of plans for that too.
[402:03.32]It was so disappointing.
[402:09.58]That's a really cool looking enemy.
[402:16.98]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, out!
[402:23.34]I've never played Mario 3D World before.
[402:25.06]How do you beat Bowser?
[402:25.76]Do you jump on his head?
[402:29.64]I've never beat Bowser.
[402:30.62]It's just me.
[402:48.62]You don't.
[402:50.14]Cart!
[402:56.07]Shit.
[402:58.25]Oh!
[402:58.65]No, I crashed!
[402:59.39]It's alright.
[403:00.49]Oh, the lava's rising.
[403:01.42]I don't know how I didn't make that jump.
[403:12.68]Twice.
[403:29.67]Finally.
[403:30.75]Imagine not having the arrows.
[403:39.80]Thank god Luigi's holding my hand.
[403:41.38]How the hell would I ever get this done?
[403:44.32]What just happened?
[403:55.27]I had to go faster than that.
[404:00.23]That guy's just sleeping.
[404:01.73]Blah!
[404:25.39]Come on.
[404:27.35]What's wrong with this car?
[404:30.45]Speed it up, Mario.
[404:31.73]Alright.
[404:38.84]What in the name of God is happening wrong here?
[404:44.80]I'm just holding down dash and jumping.
[404:55.70]Am I missing the bounce pad?
[404:57.10]Well, I didn't know that!
[405:17.86]Get the coin.
[405:18.73]I can do it.
[405:19.67]Go!
[405:21.76]Fucked up.
[405:22.26]It fucked up.
[405:22.90]It fucked up.
[405:23.20]I got like stuck and it fucked up and I didn't move anywhere.
[405:26.20]I have to do the whole thing again.
[405:31.40]Alright.
[405:46.61]Get me through this.
[405:48.31]Get me through this first part of the level gimmick.
[406:03.53]Why I tried to hit the one time that I pressed the down button and it doesn't work I'm so ready I'm so ready I think I've been pressing on these buttons too hard for so long That I drained the battery faster
[406:31.81]Like, I think I've been pressing too many buttons that have drained the battery faster.
[406:36.33]It feels a little less fluid.
[406:37.39]I have to shake up my controllers to recharge them.
[406:44.23]Just wait till they start doing that shit.
[406:45.47]I can't wait.
[406:47.35]You know those, like, flashlights that you shake and they get charged?
[406:50.77]That's gonna happen pretty soon with wireless controllers.
[406:52.63]It's probably gonna.
[407:05.75]Get out of the way!
[407:09.57]Should I just... should I step on his hands?
[407:11.27]I'm just... I'm fucking panicking right now.
[407:16.65]Just go.
[407:19.74]Alright, here we go.
[407:27.26]I'm not gonna get the coin this time.
[407:28.78]I'm just gonna beat the level.
[407:29.81]I'm not gonna be an idiot.
[407:46.04]Up.
[407:47.29]Okey-dokey.
[407:47.97]Turn.
[407:48.69]Let's go.
[407:54.55]There's a lot of unnecessary animals that I just ran over.
[408:02.49]Just get out of the car.
[408:14.91]Please don't tell me the lava's gonna be right here and I'm gonna go right into it.
[408:16.99]Oh, shit.
[408:18.83]Give it to me!
[408:45.49]How do I climb this?
[408:46.43]I... What am I doing?
[409:11.57]Give me the POW.
[409:13.31]No, give me the POW.
[409:14.55]Stop.
[409:18.89]Alright, throw it at him.
[409:23.85]Why is he a cat too?
[409:24.93]Why are we both cats?
[409:28.53]Got him.
[409:48.57]50 coins, beautiful.
[409:55.55]There's more.
[410:07.10]I think I beat the story.
[410:08.18]I think I did it.
[410:09.24]I completed it the first time ever in over 10 years.
[410:15.68]I just beat a Mario game, in quotes.
[410:32.34]I did it.
[410:32.84]I rescued the chief.
[410:35.34]Fresh air, finally.
[410:36.10]I owe you one, Mario.
[410:39.10]Stained glass is finished.
[410:40.20]We're almost done.
[410:41.26]No?
[410:41.74]There's one more thing to do.
[410:49.78]100%.
[410:49.80]That's it.
[410:53.47]Well, that was just a model.
[410:57.29]Now let's zoom out.
[410:58.57]We gotta do the whole castle.
[411:02.25]See you in 500 hours.
[411:07.71]My name could go down in history for this.
[411:09.71]But now is not the time for that.
[411:11.03]Let's go to get Princess Peach.
[411:15.63]Cutscene.
[411:39.45]Mario, you haven't changed clothes in, like, seven or eight days.
[411:42.46]Now, if only you aimed those at Bowser when he came to try to kill you all.
[411:58.37]You're good.
[412:08.98]He even says, thank you for playing.
[412:11.52]Thank you for playing.
[412:17.84]Because they're fireworks.
[412:19.84]You don't think if you got a firework, one of the big ones, shot directly at your face, that something bad wouldn't happen?
[412:26.28]Is he going to press the button again and redo the... Are we in an infinite loop?
[412:34.64]Hey, look at that.
[412:36.59]That was fun.
[412:47.90]I think we're chasing him.
[413:01.72]That was really fun.
[413:04.72]Seven hours, so six to seven hours.
[413:07.00]And there's still like 20 or 30 levels that are there.
[413:18.39]I'm gonna check and see after credits what it looks like.
[413:34.23]Now I'm ready for super expert mode.
[413:36.17]Yeah, that'll have to be for another night, though.
[413:43.99]I'm gonna go check out the other levels that were the final ones, though.
[413:55.60]Isn't Super Expert gone?
[413:56.82]Actually, I think they just did Endless Mode, right?
[414:05.16]It's no longer... Is it normal?
[414:08.00]Hard?
[414:08.62]Super hard?
[414:09.18]I like this rendition.
[414:23.36]They removed 100 lives with the difficulties the same.
[414:25.50]That makes sense.
[414:29.14]I kind of like the 100 lives thing, though.
[414:32.62]It gave you that pressure that... You only had 100 tries to get somewhere.
[414:38.78]It's kind of interesting.
[414:40.92]Although, if you did run into one of those levels during the 100 Mario challenge... If you ran into one of the troll levels, that guaranteed you were going to lose like 40 times.
[414:49.96]I mean...
[414:52.41]That did happen, didn't it?
[415:01.59]You could skip?
[415:02.34]Yeah, you could skip, that's right.
[415:04.28]That's true.
[415:14.84]The co-op sounds fun when it actually starts to work, right?
[415:17.92]Isn't it not that great right now?
[415:22.09]Didn't they not even add a bunch of the co-op multiplayer features into the game yet?
[415:27.40]No online with friends until later.
[415:31.30]How much later?
[415:57.28]You gotta buy it?
[415:57.94]I thought you just had to have the Nintendo Online Pass thing.
[416:09.46]Well, that was cute.
[416:10.96]I want to go back and see.
[416:14.31]Oh, I got the hard hat.
[416:17.73]It can actually be in Builder Mario.
[416:19.95]Super Hammer.
[416:22.69]Wait, you've earned a new part.
[416:24.40]You can use it in the Super Mario 3D World game style in CourseMaker.
[416:30.64]So you have to play through the whole thing to get the Super Hammer?
[416:34.44]Congratulations on completing Peach's Castle!
[416:36.58]You can make all kinds of courses like the ones you played in Story Mode, head over to CourseMaker and bring your ideas to life.
[416:42.43]Where's Peach?
[416:51.16]Is she here?
[416:58.19]Is Peach, like, on the level?
[417:05.07]What's your problem?
[417:07.63]Thanks, Mario!
[417:12.59]Hold on.
[417:18.15]Oh, new job from Princess Peach.
[417:19.77]I think that's what he just said.
[417:22.54]Let's go, Builder Mario!
[417:28.84]Clear the way with the Super Hammer.
[417:30.34]You need to only create a builder box with Up and Y. Could you give that a try and see if you can reach the goal?
[417:35.32]This is from Peach.
[417:36.66]And I get a gear.
[417:42.51]So this is the super secret Princess Peach end of the video game after the credits post-credits scene.
[417:51.08]Oh, shit.
[417:51.72]What the hell?
[417:53.76]Alright, hold on.
[417:54.66]What...
[418:01.63]This is crazy.
[418:02.51]So, you can build blocks?
[418:07.37]Can I only have three?
[418:08.15]I guess I can have more than three?
[418:09.46]There's a lot of cool use cases for this.
[418:24.92]Oh, you can only have... Okay, you can only have a certain amount.
[418:33.96]Dig, Mario, dig.
[418:43.06]Reflexes like a goddamn animal.
[418:46.88]Can I... Yeah.
[418:48.10]Wait, there's something over here.
[418:54.99]Nope.
[419:03.21]Now, I miss the Mario has the hammer.
[419:07.11]He doesn't really have a hammer anymore, does he?
[419:10.15]They put Mario in all kinds of, like, fursuits.
[419:13.48]But they don't really utilize his hammer anymore.
[419:32.24]Is this the wall?
[419:36.32]Well, he has it now.
[419:37.16]Oh, this hurts you.
[419:39.26]Right.
[419:40.48]Alright.
[419:42.33]Ooh, look out.
[420:00.39]Can't... whoa.
[420:02.87]Alright, well they can't be killed.
[420:04.41]Can they be boxed?
[420:05.77]No.
[420:10.23]I just slingshotted down that hole.
[420:20.78]I went so fast down that hole!
[420:31.17]Get over here.
[420:32.85]Box it up.
[420:34.01]Again.
[420:35.06]Please.
[420:36.22]Thank you.
[420:36.90]Okay.
[421:00.31]Oh, because I hit the wall, that's why.
[421:01.47]Alright, don't screw this up again, please.
[421:04.81]What am I doing wrong here?
[421:08.81]Do I have to block him off?
[421:18.08]Yep.
[421:19.86]Well, that worked.
[421:27.43]Cool mechanic.
[421:36.98]Just jump over him, dude.
[421:40.30]Try this level?
[421:41.30]I'm not gonna do any online levels tonight.
[421:45.23]Doll of the Princess Peach Dress.
[421:46.47]Cool.
[421:49.95]I'm gonna be wrapping it up here.
[421:53.67]Seven hours.
[421:55.33]Probably take about 40, 30, 40 minutes to do the bits.
[421:58.89]I'm getting a little tired.
[422:02.22]But I am going to do a multiplayer and we're going to do it again.
[422:06.32]We're just going to do it again.
[422:15.68]That was fun just to do all that.
[422:17.36]I loved that.
[422:21.15]And now I got the necessary skill set to be able to play online and do the levels and do the... And that also gives time for people to make some stuff.
[422:28.27]There is stuff that already exists.
[422:29.49]I'm sure that's great.
[422:31.64]Good luck, because multiplayer is wonky and not that great.
[422:33.82]But that's what I mean.
[422:34.46]Maybe over the next three or four days, right?
[422:38.30]Maybe they'll fix out, kink out some of the bugs.
[422:42.88]But I'm ready for the online stuff.
[422:49.49]The other story levels?
[422:51.36]Yeah, I mean, maybe I'll... Okay, here.
[422:55.34]Let me just slow down and use my words clearly.
[422:57.49]Because I'm talking over myself.
[423:00.51]Speaking, somehow.
[423:02.61]I will warm up with some of the harder ones here.
[423:08.35]I'm going to do that for less than 20-30 minutes.
[423:11.15]And then we'll spend a good regular stream time.
[423:14.39]Between 6-8 hours.
[423:16.67]Doing all the online stuff.
[423:19.99]I'm ready!
[423:22.30]But it can't happen tomorrow, because tomorrow is the green screen movie encore night.
[423:26.69]Again, if you do not have that, this is the last chance you're gonna get.
[423:29.81]Probably the last time I'm gonna talk about it.
[423:31.53]Until, obviously, the stream is tomorrow.
[423:36.85]Did I explore everything?
[423:37.71]I think I saw all this secret stuff.
[423:41.89]Oh, no I didn't.
[423:45.21]Thank you for saving the chief.
[423:46.95]We couldn't have done it without you.
[423:47.95]That said, Mario, you could probably get into that pipe if you got rid of that piranha creeper.
[423:58.23]And look, tomorrow... I might just do this tomorrow.
[424:02.01]Because it depends how long the movie night is.
[424:06.07]You know... You know what?
[424:08.07]You know... Because the movie... The encore movie night... Is only gonna be... A couple hours.
[424:19.63]That's not gonna be that long.
[424:22.65]So why not... Either do that first...
[424:28.81]And then just do Mario Maker again.
[424:36.84]That makes sense, I think.
[424:39.54]Because it's not like I don't want to turn the stream on and turn it off in like an hour and 25 minutes.
[424:43.26]Alright, that's the plan.
[424:49.16]If for some crazy reason the movie, the green screen night, takes like four or five hours, which I don't think, there's no way it will.
[424:58.84]We'll just do the multiplayer stuff tomorrow.
[425:00.64]We'll do the online courses tomorrow and stuff.
[425:06.73]The last movie night stream was seven hours or so.
[425:08.59]This one shouldn't be that.
[425:09.45]Yeah, especially if there's going to be like 60% less videos than the first one.
[425:20.77]But that's where I'm going to wrap it up.
[425:23.43]But time tomorrow, we're going to start at 3 to 4, somewhere between 3 and 4 p.m.
[425:30.11]Get three coins to be funny.
[425:32.58]I'll do it some other day.
[425:36.56]Yeah, the last movie night had hundreds of videos.
[425:38.46]This is going to be probably less than 100.
[425:39.66]So maybe, I'll probably, I don't know.
[425:49.91]We'll gauge the room.
[425:52.54]But that's happening tomorrow.
[425:54.12]I want to link the form one more time if somebody didn't get it because obviously this is the last chance you're going to get.
[426:05.15]Me shouting this out.
[426:08.27]Grab the link.
[426:12.31]Might as well turn this on too.
[426:14.65]See you tomorrow.
[426:16.63]Same time.
[426:23.80]Starting somewhere around 3 to 4 p.m.
[426:25.40]Pacific.
[426:28.76]Potentially earlier.
[426:31.38]It depends on when I get up and get going.
[426:34.90]But... Plan for the normal time.
[426:43.03]Anywho.
[426:43.27]If you've taken off, hopefully we'll see you tomorrow.
[426:45.51]If not, maybe we'll see you again soon.
[426:49.51]Let me just... Go...
[426:54.03]Let me grab this.
[426:58.31]Here is the submission form.
[427:00.32]Only submit once.
[427:03.70]Not more than once.
[427:07.38]Have it be less than three minutes.
[427:12.95]And again, this is not a contest.
[427:19.44]So not all submissions, if your submission doesn't get picked, it's not like it wasn't any good.
[427:25.12]We're just trying to condense them down into ones that are not so similar and some of that are maybe a little bit higher quality and don't see the same kind of thing over and over again, right?
[427:35.19]It's not a contest.
[427:38.89]And after this is all done, I'm going to probably see if we can do just another big playlist and not stream it, but have a second Encore playlist with most of the submissions, or at least some of the ones that we could show afterwards.
[427:54.42]But I'm going to just go pee.
[427:56.52]I'll be right back.
[427:57.02]We'll do the bits.
[427:59.82]And I will be right back.
[428:02.02]See you shortly.
[428:14.09]Thank you.
[429:15.13]you
[429:52.56]I have to just walk back up.
[429:53.94]I've got a bad migraine right now.
[429:56.48]Where the hell did this come from?
[430:01.25]Strange.
[430:05.25]Being old, probably.
[430:08.05]Well, we don't have very... There's not a whole lot of bits tonight, so we should be able to get through this pretty quickly.
[430:16.10]Mario migraine.
[430:18.56]Nah, I probably just need to eat something.
[430:21.04]Anyways, thank you to Lazy Luke for the $2.50.
[430:23.02]Thank you, Lazy Luke.
[430:24.94]I'm going to copy that.
[430:25.50]And I'm going to hold on to this.
[430:26.62]If anyone wants to see.
[430:50.63]Offices of Charma.org.
[430:56.31]Thank you, Lazy Luke.
[431:00.77]We also had... DStroke, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[431:04.44]How is Burgah Boy doing?
[431:05.40]Is he still living in the brash Boston life?
[431:08.52]Yeah.
[431:09.68]Burgah Boy has a family now.
[431:11.70]He's got children.
[431:13.00]He's married.
[431:14.64]And he's... He's doing just fine.
[431:23.33]But thank you for the 10 bucks.
[431:24.49]Appreciate it.
[431:27.11]Also, thank you to Swiggity Swanky for the $5.
[431:30.68]Remember this?
[431:32.62]Show this to chat.
[431:33.48]You look so young and still so cute.
[431:35.60]Hold on.
[431:35.92]Let me see.
[431:54.47]Where... Let's see.
[431:55.93]Browser source.
[431:56.65]Let's watch this.
[432:04.69]I gotta unplug this.
[432:07.54]This is the other Mario Maker stream.
[432:13.24]Is this where I said I was gonna quit the game forever?
[432:20.14]I can't hear it.
[432:24.35]Why can I not hear this?
[432:32.32]Can you guys hear this?
[432:33.04]I can hear that.
[432:35.96]Why can I not hear this?
[432:42.77]Oh, is it because it's muted?
[432:46.35]It's muted.
[432:47.46]Why would you do that?
[432:55.11]Look at that big-ass dude on my face.
[432:56.33]Stream... Jerma Height... Stream sucks.
[433:01.66]The Jerma Height experience.
[433:03.16]Right.
[433:35.16]Well, you have a few days.
[433:37.22]No, you don't.
[433:37.64]You have until tomorrow, apparently.
[433:38.86]And maybe we'll do it again.
[433:39.68]But what do you mean I looked so young?
[433:44.36]That was two years ago.
[433:46.56]That was not that long ago.
[433:52.10]That was like... That was 24 months ago.
[433:57.97]I have better lighting on my face.
[434:00.53]I'm not aging fast.
[434:01.67]I was 32 there.
[434:04.96]I've already aged as much as I'm going to age.
[434:07.38]Until I hit, like, 50.
[434:08.14]Oh, my fucking head.
[434:19.19]Why is my brain doing this right now?
[434:20.91]Where were we?
[434:21.37]Down here?
[434:22.37]Right here.
[434:24.55]Thank you to Omega Rose for the $10.
[434:27.07]Cheers from Disco Deer.
[434:29.07]What's Disco Deer?
[434:33.04]Disco Deer?
[434:39.41]Well, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[434:41.70]We also had, uh, HamsterThePie for $2.50.
[434:44.17]I mean, the easy answer is go to a Red Sox game.
[435:05.37]The Red Sox, it's going to be probably hard to get tickets at the same day whenever you're going, but the Red Sox play.
[435:10.73]Fenway's awesome.
[435:13.01]I would also say, if you're in that kind of area, Jillian's is awesome.
[435:18.44]They've got a giant arcade.
[435:20.62]They've got pool.
[435:21.34]They've got bowling.
[435:22.06]It's pretty much everything you want.
[435:23.00]It's like Dave & Buster's.
[435:24.20]Dave & Buster's wasn't kind of like the Chuck E. Cheese of Chuck E. Cheese for adults.
[435:30.95]You know what I'm saying?
[435:36.16]So, I would say go to Jillian's.
[435:42.02]Dave & Buster's is the adult Chuck E. Cheese.
[435:45.77]Jillian's is what Dave & Buster's should be.
[435:51.45]It's like a Dave & Buster's 3.0.
[435:52.63]That's not saying that Dave & Buster's is bad.
[435:58.23]Chuck E. Cheese is cool.
[436:07.36]Museum of Science is, yeah, I said that this past week too.
[436:11.62]Museum of Science is awesome.
[436:13.52]Jillian's is awesome, and maybe go see a Red Sox game.
[436:16.96]Fenway is like a fucking thousand years old at this point.
[436:20.93]It's kind of worth seeing.
[436:30.87]I'm losing my place again.
[436:31.91]How do I lose my place every time?
[436:35.73]Here we go.
[436:39.88]Spoons for self-defense.
[436:41.30]Thanks for the $15.
[436:44.22]Jerma, just want to say that you're my favorite streamer.
[436:46.00]Thank you so much for what you do.
[436:47.91]This next part is in parentheses.
[436:49.47]It's personal, so please don't read it out loud.
[436:51.43]Okay.
[436:54.83]I'm going to read it out loud.
[436:56.07]So, I'm sorry, but I'm going to go against your wishes here.
[436:59.15]Hahaha, Jerma, you're a loser.
[437:00.57]Game sucks.
[437:01.11]Streamer sucks.
[437:01.71]You're going to start crying and Chad is going to think I said something nice to you.
[437:14.69]I'll read this out loud.
[437:17.58]Well, thank you.
[437:23.80]But hamster the pie, thanks for the $2.50, and I hope you enjoy Boston.
[437:27.32]It's a great city.
[437:28.28]And... And also spoons for self-defense, thanks for the $15.
[437:36.20]Uh, Griff, thanks for five bucks.
[437:37.94]Yo, Jerma, can't tell you how excited I was to finally catch you live.
[437:40.70]I never can due to my schedule.
[437:42.97]Thank you for all the effort you put into your content.
[437:45.53]The only person that has made me cry, laugh just from watching something.
[437:48.37]Cheers, man.
[437:48.81]Have a good night.
[437:50.05]Griff, have a great night as well.
[437:51.79]Thank you so much for the five dollars.
[437:52.95]Thanks for those insanely kind words.
[437:57.05]Uh, and then let me get the credits on here.
[438:02.76]The stream credits.
[438:05.28]All the subs, all the resubs.
[438:08.98]On this particular night tonight.
[438:11.88]Where are they?
[438:12.30]Uh-oh, here they come.
[438:17.81]Thank you.
[438:23.19]Hey, the gun game you played a while ago on the VR just got an officially sanctioned Team Fortress 2 game mode with fully...
[438:30.97]Realized weapons, rocket jumping, etc.
[438:32.82]Wait, what do you mean?
[438:35.14]Are you talking about like a TF2 update?
[438:39.48]We're talking about that Pavlov.
[438:44.14]Oh, the Meat Fortress.
[438:45.11]Right, right.
[438:45.43]Yeah, yeah.
[438:46.31]Yeah, we saw that video.
[438:49.67]Yeah, I know, I saw it.
[438:50.93]It's for Holy Hand Grenade and Horseshoes and Hot Dogs, whatever it is.
[438:58.02]Yeah, I'll go back to VR eventually.
[439:00.86]Just got kind of too much going on.
[439:02.10]Because already the next couple weeks of streams are really sort of planned out at the moment, so... It's released now.
[439:10.97]Well, that's awesome.
[439:12.27]Hopefully it's fun.
[439:17.94]Jeremiah, I just got back from going out.
[439:19.18]Is the VOD worth checking out?
[439:21.57]Do you like Super Mario?
[439:23.60]Because it was just Super Mario.
[439:26.54]I beat the whole... Well, not the whole thing.
[439:28.86]I completed the storyline of the Mario Maker 2 campaign.
[439:33.90]I had to get myself back into the groove of playing Mario.
[439:37.45]It's been a while, and I enjoyed it, and I think you should watch it.
[439:45.53]But... Thank you, too.
[439:48.46]That was...
[439:52.66]Hold on.
[439:53.20]Hold on.
[439:55.44]Alright, I'm fine.
[439:58.16]The right side of my head, just like, for some reason, is just like... This happens.
[440:03.49]It's from sleep.
[440:05.29]I can always tell when I'm gonna have a migraine during the day.
[440:07.67]Because I will... Sleep triggers it for me.
[440:10.07]And it has to be.
[440:11.39]Because I'll wake up... And then fall back asleep for four hours or so.
[440:17.20]And that's what gives me the headache.
[440:20.10]Later on.
[440:20.48]It's weird.
[440:24.70]But thank you, FreudianWeapon, for the 250.
[440:26.30]Happy Friday, jermaHeart.
[440:27.32]I was pretty on the fence about Mario Maker, but I think I'm gonna go for it.
[440:31.01]Maybe, just maybe, I might make some bomb-ass levels.
[440:35.81]There is a lot to do in Mario Maker, so... There are lots of people that make some crazy shit, so... I wish you luck.
[440:44.93]Thank you so much for the 250.
[440:45.93]Uh... Exili... Exili... Exilicon, thanks for the $5.00.
[440:54.70]Some bits to help support the million dollar joke.
[440:58.78]Did I say Kiwo there?
[441:00.24]Was Kiwo here tonight?
[441:03.08]How did I miss Kiwo being here?
[441:05.39]What kind of a friend am I?
[441:13.11]You were raging.
[441:14.11]Oh.
[441:15.83]Was I just losing my mind?
[441:20.31]But, thank you for the $5, support the million dollar joke.
[441:24.85]I appreciate it.
[441:28.09]I'll be working on that after tomorrow.
[441:30.18]I'm a businessman now, you know, I'm wheeling and dealing now.
[441:39.09]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[441:41.69]This is essentially the last call for you to do a green screen submission over the next couple hours.
[441:47.09]I cannot guarantee that even if you have an immaculate, unbelievable submission, I cannot guarantee that if you don't get it in over the next few days.
[441:58.60]No, what?
[442:00.22]It's tomorrow.
[442:02.02]Over the next few hours, I cannot guarantee that it'll be included, so...
[442:11.19]I will feed everybody on Stream Legends when I end the stream.
[442:13.45]I am going to go take a Tylenol and go put my head down because I don't know what's going on.
[442:19.26]It's kind of just eating me alive at the moment for some reason.
[442:24.56]So good night.
[442:25.34]Take care.
[442:26.82]Much love to you.
[442:28.98]I'll see you guys soon.
[442:30.96]Have a great night.
[442:59.12]Thank you.
