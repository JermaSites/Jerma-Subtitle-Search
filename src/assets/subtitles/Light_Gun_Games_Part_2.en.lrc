[ve:60.16.100]

[01:03.64]Oh, hey, what do you know?
[01:06.15]Look at that.
[01:06.91]Here we are playing a video game.
[01:08.75]What's up guys?
[01:10.98]How you doing?
[01:12.24]Oh wait, we're not starting yet.
[01:15.12]Starting soon, hold on.
[01:32.85]Alright, so we're gonna just go here.
[01:35.33]We're gonna just fucking go, and I'll tell you why.
[01:37.93]We only have, I don't know how much time we have on the battery of this new camera that I got.
[01:43.49]I got a brand new, well, that's a lie.
[01:45.97]I have a camera that's like a little Sony Handycam, and I figured, oh shit, maybe this would be a bit of high quality, but then like a webcam, let me try to hook that up with HD.
[01:55.90]I hooked it up, it works.
[01:58.14]Problem!
[01:59.57]Problem number one.
[02:00.55]There's only, like, probably two hours of battery on this thing before I have to plug it in again.
[02:06.10]So, welcome to the stream.
[02:08.62]Let's go.
[02:09.64]How are you?
[02:12.68]Here we are.
[02:14.00]So, as you can see, the new quality, new camera, right?
[02:18.88]Take a look at that.
[02:19.83]I mean, there's still scan lines, but, you know, it looks better than it did yesterday.
[02:25.01]No, it's like four days ago.
[02:26.61]I don't even know what we played like on it.
[02:29.76]It definitely looks a lot better than it did.
[02:31.65]I can guarantee you that.
[02:33.21]Yeah.
[02:34.41]So, uh, let's go ahead and get started.
[02:37.29]This is Point Blank 2.
[02:38.35]Let's turn that volume up so you guys can hear, because we've got a fucking professional stream here.
[02:47.51]You love my mullet?
[02:49.98]Good!
[02:51.94]So, everything's all calibrated, ready to go.
[02:57.16]Show us your teeth.
[03:00.07]why hey what's the shirt I don't know I think it's uh it's the it's the mexican football team I don't I don't know guys I sometimes I just get shirts that I think I like the way it looks like the green and the red and I like the way it looks what I can't I can't support the football team that I like
[03:25.66]I mean, yes, granted, I've only watched maybe 45 minutes total of soccer.
[03:29.06]Yeah, I'm gonna call it soccer because that's because I'm a stupid idiot American and we call things differently.
[03:34.51]Just like the inches, you know, there's like two inches of snow.
[03:37.13]I probably just triggered like 35 Europeans right now.
[03:42.45]I just, I like the shirt.
[03:43.67]I can't just like the shirt.
[03:44.79]I'm not ripping this, I like this shirt.
[03:52.02]We're wasting battery time.
[03:53.82]Let's go.
[03:54.76]Point Blank 2.
[03:55.28]This is a classic.
[03:57.28]This is one of my favorites.
[03:59.08]Absolute classic.
[03:59.91]Point Blank 2, if you've never played it before.
[04:02.67]Light Gun.
[04:03.67]Would you look at that?
[04:04.33]Alright, explain it.
[04:05.19]Good.
[04:05.79]Let's do Point Blank Castle.
[04:07.79]And let's shoot some stuff.
[04:11.39]Okay, these pants don't have a fly.
[04:12.85]That's good.
[04:14.21]Welcome to Point Blank Castle.
[04:16.63]There's versus, there's endurance, that's how far you can get, or there's just plain old arcade.
[04:21.47]Let's just do arcade, let's warm up a little bit here.
[04:28.39]Another flash screen.
[04:30.12]Yeah, it's gonna be a flash the screen stream, but at least it looks better than yesterday, and we're already down to 50% battery.
[04:39.20]Just let me warm up, let me just get, look, I got an emergency backup, so don't worry, this goes down.
[04:45.01]Let's just do practice.
[04:45.69]Let's do some stages.
[04:46.57]These are all new levels, but not like Point Blank 1.
[04:49.07]These are new.
[04:50.23]This one, shoot the can.
[04:53.18]Shoot this one.
[04:53.58]It's called Ditch the Can.
[04:54.54]Shoot the can.
[04:56.76]Alright.
[04:57.32]Shoot the can to keep it airborne.
[04:59.68]You got to keep it in the air.
[05:00.83]Got five seconds.
[05:02.21]No shot limit.
[05:02.79]Let me show you how it's done.
[05:04.67]Let's warm it up.
[05:16.58]And this is why we gotta warm up, because obviously it had a little bit of trouble.
[05:20.28]It's alright.
[05:26.64]It's just practice.
[05:27.42]We're just practicing right now.
[05:30.87]It's just practice.
[05:33.01]Don't worry.
[05:34.83]I'm a little jittery right now.
[05:36.33]All I had is coffee and some oregano.
[05:39.29]I just ate a fucking spoonful of oregano.
[05:41.23]Don't ask me why.
[05:41.93]Destroyed all the barrels.
[05:43.37]You got it.
[05:56.11]That was easy.
[05:58.71]I gotta get my, like, groove here.
[06:01.71]Wait, why did I do that?
[06:02.41]Because there's fucking vitamins in oregano.
[06:04.09]There's like 20% of your daily vitamins in a spoonful of oregano.
[06:06.67]Look it up.
[06:08.69]Sometimes when I'm feeling down and I'm feeling a little bit fuzzy, I just take, I ate like a spoonful of thyme or a spoonful of oregano.
[06:16.73]Science will tell you that it's what you're supposed to do.
[06:18.57]Destroy the house 30 times to destroy it.
[06:21.87]You know how I do these ones.
[06:22.77]Check this.
[06:23.99]We'll do it again.
[06:24.65]Something for the new kids.
[06:33.06]That's for the new kids that weren't here last time.
[06:41.49]When am I going to cut my hair?
[06:42.49]I don't know, dude.
[06:44.09]Like, when I have time.
[06:45.13]Oh, burp.
[06:53.12]Spoonful of rosemary.
[06:54.30]Alright.
[06:55.26]Shoot at least 11 targets in the order they flash.
[06:58.72]Okay, this is new.
[07:03.52]Oh god.
[07:04.77]What?
[07:05.39]Okay, I get it.
[07:08.49]Wait, what?
[07:09.37]Okay.
[07:12.71]Confused there.
[07:27.04]a little bit of time.
[07:33.02]We can play a light gun game.
[07:34.74]We're not playing the real thing right now.
[07:35.78]We're just doing a little warm up.
[07:40.27]Streamer doesn't read chat.
[07:41.87]Well, that's because it's behind me.
[07:44.19]So if I had a pair of eyes this way, every time you see me turn this way, I'm reading the chat.
[07:51.09]That's like what I'm doing.
[07:57.22]I only expect into reaction time.
[07:59.06]No, I only expect into rapid fire.
[08:01.66]We can do... No, let's just do Namco.
[08:03.18]Because that was all fake.
[08:06.80]Alright, let's do a real one.
[08:08.26]I think I'm ready.
[08:09.73]We got a good battery.
[08:11.77]Let's do arcade again.
[08:13.33]Let's try it.
[08:16.07]There are like, I think, 50 plus minigames in this one.
[08:19.55]Let's do Beginner.
[08:26.64]Okay, these are all new.
[08:28.48]This one is just math.
[08:31.45]I'm probably gonna fail this one.
[08:33.43]Because I'm bad at math.
[08:34.89]I still use my fingers.
[08:36.19]I don't know, we probably talked about that before.
[08:38.73]Shoot at least seven correct answers.
[08:41.77]Five seconds.
[08:43.07]Shit, I'm terrible with like... What?
[08:54.24]What is it?
[08:56.72]Five, eight, two, seven, eight, four, five, three, three, zero, zero, four, no, three, nine, three, two.
[09:14.05]That's alright, we're fine.
[09:17.87]I swear to God, dude, what's the thing when you can't do math?
[09:23.82]Like, you just can't do it.
[09:25.16]It's like a disorder.
[09:26.12]It's called, like, mathlexia or something.
[09:31.17]Hold on.
[09:33.39]Make sure I have this refreshed.
[09:34.81]Does it choose for me?
[09:35.87]No?
[09:39.01]What is Jex?
[09:42.05]Uh, Jex is the name of me.
[09:45.98]That's me.
[09:46.34]I'm Officer Jex.
[09:47.20]Alright, we're gonna do this one.
[09:49.40]Whatever this one is.
[09:50.02]Who knows?
[09:53.04]Am I gonna be flashed again?
[09:54.00]I gotta get flashed again, unfortunately.
[09:56.34]See, you can see the lines, too.
[09:57.75]Oh, keep the UFOs away.
[09:59.03]You got it.
[10:00.11]Five seconds.
[10:26.16]Whoa!
[10:27.62]I wanna recalibrate the gun.
[10:29.66]After we do this one, I feel like it's a little off to the left.
[10:33.72]I'll fix that.
[10:37.65]You played the shit out of this in arcades?
[10:39.09]Yeah, it's cause this is one of the best, this is the light gun game.
[10:43.51]This is light gun game, the game.
[10:46.57]If you don't know, if you played light gun, you ever played point blank or point blank two, three?
[10:51.00]I'm sorry.
[10:52.10]Shoot the stopwatch after it reaches .5 seconds.
[10:57.00]This is just a full-on reaction time.
[11:04.68]Oh, after it reaches 0.5 seconds.
[11:10.13]Okay.
[11:11.79]That's going to get so hard when that gets to like 0.1.
[11:15.35]God.
[11:16.35]Got to be ready for that.
[11:17.09]It's just duck hunt.
[11:24.61]Duck Hunt was good, but this was in the arcades.
[11:28.43]Should release six animals that match the sounds.
[11:32.43]God, okay, this is gonna be like cows and pigs and shit.
[11:43.28]What is that?
[11:43.86]Somebody's starting their car.
[11:53.90]What?
[11:54.12]Somebody just burped!
[12:05.67]What the fuck?
[12:09.65]That was... Those animals did... What does a frog make for a noise?
[12:12.57]How are you supposed to get that one?
[12:14.65]Alright, this one is insane.
[12:19.20]But we're on beginner, so it's probably not going to be that bad.
[12:24.21]Throws them in there sometimes.
[12:26.03]Should release 33 toy mouse, mouses, mice.
[12:27.29]20 seconds.
[12:27.75]No limit.
[13:02.65]I feel like I need more warm-up, man.
[13:04.93]I need to recalibrate and I need some more warm-up.
[13:08.23]Because I'm just not like super duper, you know what I mean?
[13:12.34]Not today.
[13:14.62]I was killing it last time.
[13:15.96]Apparently not today.
[13:22.02]Okay, with it, don't worry.
[13:24.39]Keep the barrels away from Dr. Don.
[13:57.19]It's not right.
[13:58.67]It's like, it's like over there.
[14:01.10]I gotta fix that.
[14:01.64]That's gonna drive me fucking crazy.
[14:04.72]Can I do it now?
[14:08.98]I don't think I can do it now, can I?
[14:10.16]No.
[14:11.00]I'm gonna do it afterwards.
[14:16.71]How do you get this set up?
[14:17.87]That was a ton of pain.
[14:21.87]Shoot at least 16 targets of your color.
[14:23.89]20 seconds.
[14:56.34]excuses I don't do any more of these counting ones these ones suck shoot at least 20 targets in numerical order 20 seconds got plenty of time
[15:44.80]This music, yeah, it's old school.
[15:46.12]It's good stuff.
[15:47.22]I love this shit.
[15:47.86]I used to sit in the arcades and play this for hours.
[15:51.32]I would go in with 20 bucks and I would come out.
[15:53.34]Hold on, we got a bonus stage here.
[15:58.44]Find the bonus life, just like the other ones, one shot.
[16:01.64]Look, I'll show you, ready?
[16:02.24]It's like, it's like kind of, I'm not enjoying the way this is set up.
[16:16.84]Got an extra life, that's good.
[16:19.32]Extra life works for me.
[16:23.00]That's cheating.
[16:23.94]I know, but I... Just wait till we do very hard, and I blow your goddamn socks off with my incredible light gun skills.
[16:38.19]I didn't, like, do my, like, jumping jacks.
[16:40.10]If you wanna play light gun, you gotta, like, be stretched out.
[16:43.40]Shoot the target to get at least 540 points.
[16:45.94]Six shots.
[16:59.05]I was so proud of myself right there.
[17:00.85]What?
[17:01.11]I got in the exact middle every time.
[17:04.27]Was that to go on the head?
[17:05.07]What?
[17:09.24]That was perfect in the middle every time.
[17:11.31]Oh well.
[17:17.41]When am I gonna play House of the Dead?
[17:19.47]When I do Dreamcast.
[17:20.39]Dreamcast is over here right now.
[17:21.75]We're doing PlayStation 1, first of all.
[17:45.96]There's really not that many light gun games out there.
[17:50.04]There's really the Time Crisis games, there's Point Blank, there's House of the Dead, and then there's the old really shit games that you've seen on the SEGA.
[17:58.87]Remember when we played the SEGA CD, the Lethal Enforcer games?
[18:01.93]Those things are fucking terrible.
[18:05.52]There's 18 criminals, I'm usually pretty good at these.
[18:10.84]Oh, boy!
[18:11.74]Whoops, sorry, lady.
[18:13.32]Wow!
[18:18.44]Oh!
[18:19.93]He's usually pretty good at these!
[18:22.33]He's pretty good!
[18:23.31]Might as well just call it a day!
[18:32.39]Still passive, but I lost all my lives.
[18:33.98]Like, I...
[18:36.06]I need to stop taking, like, a fucking brain supplement.
[18:38.05]You know what I mean?
[18:38.51]Like, I need to take, like, Ginkgo Bilobo.
[18:40.95]Whatever the fuck it is.
[18:43.73]I shot every single person that came up.
[18:46.60]They all have, like, the pink shirts on.
[18:48.12]Oh, this is cool.
[18:50.84]Shoot at least 30 Galagas.
[19:26.50]Take that, ginko biloba, what is it?
[19:29.52]It's ginko?
[19:34.60]Ginko, what is it called?
[19:36.81]Rocky Balboa, no, it's ginko.
[19:43.79]See the evil lord hiding in the back.
[19:47.11]25 seconds, no limit, okay.
[20:04.17]Ah, it's not off, it's off!
[20:05.35]That was it, he's dead.
[20:13.66]Got him.
[20:16.50]Groucho Balloon, Balloon Boy?
[20:21.31]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[20:25.17]Hey.
[20:27.05]Hey, how you doing?
[20:27.71]Remember we did that joke last time?
[20:35.19]Plinko.
[20:36.91]I'm not joking.
[20:37.89]Ginkgo biloba is a real supplement.
[20:41.28]Let me just shoot some animals here.
[20:42.94]Hold on.
[20:43.78]Give me a minute.
[21:11.04]Did you say WebMD?
[21:13.82]What?
[21:14.44]No, I'm telling you.
[21:15.24]Look it up.
[21:15.64]You'll see.
[21:24.59]What the fuck?
[21:25.21]I'm trying to just queue it up.
[21:26.73]This is what happens when you don't hydrate.
[21:30.73]Yeah, of course.
[21:31.57]We've got half battery still.
[21:32.73]Good.
[21:33.67]Hit the target with one shot.
[21:34.73]I've got to be ready.
[21:35.31]Eight seconds.
[21:46.50]First thing was WebMD.
[21:49.52]Yeah, I mean, WebMD is a resource to go online and find out about, like, all the illnesses that you probably have.
[21:57.17]I don't like WebMD, because WebMD is weird, because you can type in a symptom in WebMD.
[22:01.51]For instance, like, runny nose.
[22:03.33]Oh, you know, I got a runny nose.
[22:04.79]Let me look that up.
[22:05.47]Like, runny nose WebMD.
[22:07.21]It's like, oh, you know, here's like 700 illnesses you probably have.
[22:10.37]And then you turn into, like, a hypochondriac.
[22:32.21]That was weird.
[22:32.65]Yeah, it's like, oh, I have a, um... I have, like, a rash on my forearm right here, and it's really itchy, and it was, like, pussy.
[22:44.42]Oh, okay, well... You have, um... Yeah, you have lupus.
[22:48.62]It's like, okay.
[22:50.66]Oh, you better get that checked out.
[22:51.79]You probably have, uh... You probably have, like, a brain tumor.
[22:56.51]It's like, what, a brain tumor?
[23:02.73]I didn't even know that was what was happening.
[23:03.98]We were lighting up the castle.
[23:13.96]I'm going to do Atari 2600.
[23:15.33]I'm not doing Atari 2600.
[23:17.85]That guy, Kim asked me this the other day.
[23:20.57]She's like, oh, why don't you do Atari too?
[23:23.35]You guys don't want to see Atari.
[23:25.90]Atari sucks.
[23:27.42]Atari is, you have a joystick and it's...
[23:30.45]a bright green background screen, and then like three pixels as your character, and then another three pixels as the other character, and you have to go around them.
[23:42.62]Nobody wants to see that.
[23:45.80]Trust me.
[23:49.95]You guys really, you don't wanna see that shit.
[23:53.96]Alright, let's recalibrate and try it.
[23:56.32]Let's do one more on beginner just to get the cobwebs out.
[24:00.42]I'm going to call this cobweb.
[24:14.81]Yeah, see, cobweb MD.
[24:18.43]That's how you know that I wasn't prepared for it.
[24:20.55]That was cobweb MD.
[24:24.67]Point blank, alright, go back, I'm gonna recalibrate.
[24:28.73]Let's get it good, huh?
[24:32.90]I think we're gonna have to go into emergency mode here, I think, in like the next 30 minutes, and like plug this back in.
[24:45.02]I got it under control though, don't you worry.
[24:59.58]Feels better.
[25:00.38]That feels better.
[25:01.38]We're gonna do it on hard now.
[25:19.21]I just saw the now loading blinking and I thought it said low battery blinking.
[25:23.11]I'm like paranoid about this shit.
[25:25.63]There's always something, doesn't matter what it is.
[25:27.36]This was plugged in all day.
[25:28.62]It looks better than last time, right?
[25:33.08]A lot better.
[25:36.04]I can't even plug this into a wall outlet.
[25:39.34]Alright, let's do advanced.
[25:41.02]I'm ready.
[25:43.60]Or am I?
[25:44.10]These are stuff we haven't seen.
[25:45.25]Okay, what is this one?
[25:54.20]Hit the coin with one shot.
[25:55.56]So he's gonna flick it up in the air.
[26:04.70]Okay.
[26:06.90]Dick!
[26:10.22]I didn't know how slow or fast it went.
[26:26.54]Shoot at least 45 targets.
[26:28.45]Alright, this is where we gotta separate the non-gun cons from the gun cons, you know what I mean?
[27:00.35]That didn't even make any sense.
[27:10.11]Apparently I'm not a gun con.
[27:13.64]Shoot all the targets if you're probably good.
[27:15.22]I have 10 shots in 10 seconds.
[27:18.62]Oh my fucking god, alright.
[27:30.76]These are all like brand new to me.
[27:32.37]No, exit the fucking game.
[27:35.45]We're starting over.
[27:46.07]I ate too much pasta today, like that's the fucking problem.
[27:49.99]Don't ever eat pasta, like a dickload of pasta and cheese and bread before you wanna play a fucking light gun game.
[27:55.90]Guaranteed you're gonna be slow.
[27:57.68]This is why I'm like slow today.
[28:01.40]I was dunking it in like the fucking oil and cheese, the bread, and it was just filling me up.
[28:08.17]I should've eaten carrots.
[28:09.75]I should've had carrots with a little chopped onion and a salad.
[28:22.58]Oil, I'm more oil than like stomach acid right now.
[28:26.78]Alright, quiet.
[28:50.37]Fucking just barely.
[28:51.53]That one sucks.
[28:54.49]This is like no rhyme or reason to that one.
[28:59.02]I can't believe you'd insult.
[29:00.14]I'm not insulting pasta, I'm just saying.
[29:03.24]Pasta's probably not the best idea.
[29:05.00]No, pasta's like it's a lot of carbs.
[29:08.64]Carbs are good.
[29:09.74]Your carbs are not the problem.
[29:11.46]It's like the fucking oil.
[29:12.95]Shoot at least 30 cats.
[29:14.11]Okay, I can do this one.
[29:16.33]20 seconds, 30 cats.
[29:30.60]Damn, this is fucking hard.
[29:44.85]Holy shit.
[29:47.59]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[29:50.49]Fuckin' never eatin' goddamn oil again.
[29:52.15]That like... Stream shoots in an alley on stream out of rage.
[30:05.76]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me right now.
[30:34.68]These are all so odd.
[30:35.62]I don't remember these being so fucking weird.
[30:38.56]I can see the pasta coming out of your pores.
[30:45.10]I'm just like, like worms are coming out of my face.
[30:49.72]Milkshake too.
[30:51.28]God damn it.
[30:51.88]Like I'm thinking of all the fucking bad, poor life choices.
[30:54.58]I drank like an extra large milkshake from Dairy Queen.
[30:58.12]I'm like so heavy right now.
[31:03.65]It was fucking gross.
[31:33.18]Not this time.
[31:38.35]How do you do that?
[31:39.33]I can't even finish a medium.
[31:40.71]I had fucking a bunch of fucking oil, pasta and cheese, a bunch of bread, a huge extra large milkshake.
[31:51.97]What else did I do this morning?
[31:54.55]This was all within the last, I did this like in a 45 minute timeframe.
[31:57.73]Let's go with this one.
[32:04.10]He won't answer.
[32:04.70]No, no, it's too early for you to get a dad bod.
[32:08.24]No, it's not.
[32:08.86]What are you talking about?
[32:09.56]What do you mean it's too early for you to get a dad bod?
[32:13.19]Uh, guys, I'm fucking 32.
[32:14.47]I'm not like 25 anymore.
[32:49.26]Yeah, like, right over the hill.
[32:50.80]I'll be over the hill in, like, seven years, eight years.
[32:54.54]That's... I'm not looking forward to that.
[32:56.06]Don't remind me about that shit.
[33:03.52]Like, what, I'm not allowed to have a dad bod right now?
[33:06.14]I just told you what I had for dinner, like, lunch, breakfast today.
[33:09.46]I'm gonna shoot the pears.
[33:11.18]Oh, God, here comes a failure.
[33:20.96]Oh, God.
[33:22.26]What?
[33:22.78]Oh, fuck.
[33:29.64]I didn't even pay attention.
[33:30.68]I didn't... I didn't even know that's what was fucking happening.
[33:43.81]I'm, like, shooting the pears.
[33:45.13]Like, why is this not working?
[33:48.78]Eight years ago, you were young.
[33:50.58]I was, I was very young eight years ago.
[33:56.38]I was like 22, 23, whatever I was.
[33:59.30]That's a long time ago.
[34:01.28]Shoot at least 20 targets.
[34:06.20]No bullet limit, 20 seconds on the clock.
[34:09.60]And three, two, one, go!
[34:33.85]Wow, that was close.
[34:38.40]Jex would have remembered those cards.
[34:40.12]Well, Jex is currently not here right now.
[34:45.84]I'm not doing terrible, I'm doing alright.
[34:48.36]I'm doing okay.
[34:49.66]You know, come on.
[34:52.85]Shoot at least 12 targets of your own color, don't shoot blue.
[34:57.99]No limit, 20 seconds.
[35:07.16]Oh, eat a dick.
[35:08.98]Oh, this is so hard.
[35:17.36]What's with all these, like, weird, like, puzzle-y, I wanna just shoot stuff.
[35:24.11]Ay-yi-yi.
[35:27.85]It's like these weird little puzzle-y ones.
[35:29.63]I wanna, like, shoot the fuckin' aliens.
[35:34.61]God damn it.
[35:35.45]Give me a break.
[35:40.94]Like, that's not even about accuracy or like how quick or how accurate you are.
[35:44.90]It's just like, deal with the bullshit and then shoot the fucking target.
[35:48.57]Gotta be a Modern Warfare 3 YouTuber.
[36:02.15]Wait, when was I ever a Modern Warfare 3 guy?
[36:05.22]I made like two videos on that terrible fucking game.
[36:07.88]And actually the video was alright.
[36:09.48]Oh, the game is terrible.
[36:11.29]Don't pretend like it was any good.
[36:19.28]Shoot the airplane 60 times.
[36:20.60]This is what I'm talking about.
[36:44.31]Ow!
[36:45.51]Okay, I didn't know that I had to destroy the parts.
[36:47.36]That was no brain spammer.
[36:53.16]There's no brain on this guy.
[36:55.64]He's fucking brainless.
[36:59.76]This is what I'm talking about.
[37:01.13]Give me like the shoot, the monsters and the bad guys.
[37:03.93]38, shoot 38 ninjas.
[37:38.19]54, get out of my life.
[37:45.15]I'm 38.
[37:46.07]Why are we counting my age?
[37:49.11]Age is just a number, okay?
[37:53.24]This one's gonna suck.
[37:54.26]What is it, point?
[38:01.58]After it reaches .3 seconds, okay.
[38:18.09]No, what are you guys saying?
[38:19.93]Age is just a number.
[38:21.21]Like, once I become 40, 40's 40.
[38:24.05]Doesn't matter.
[38:24.55]I'm already as old as I'm going to look.
[38:27.91]I'm not going to get any older than this.
[38:29.07]I mean, I might lose a little bit of hair, but that's going to happen.
[38:33.30]Age is just a number.
[38:34.82]After, like, 40.
[38:37.54]After 40, it doesn't matter until you're dead.
[38:39.06]Alright, this one's insane.
[38:41.18]I don't know why.
[38:42.12]Okay.
[38:43.86]Okay.
[38:52.13]I swear to God, this is something's not right.
[38:55.52]Something's not right.
[38:56.52]Remember this fucking grandma TV?
[38:59.58]I'm about to poke my fucking foot through it.
[39:08.16]Back on at 45?
[39:08.68]Probably.
[39:09.38]You wouldn't be surprised.
[39:15.74]Chord is loose in the back probably.
[39:19.14]Shoot at least eight targets that match the examples.
[39:23.85]Alright, sure thing.
[39:24.87]Come on, what?
[40:03.44]You guys are taking this way too far.
[40:12.51]Age is just a number after you turn like 25.
[40:15.69]Once you're like 30, that's what I'm talking about.
[40:20.75]Don't put fucking words in my mouth.
[40:23.23]Find and shoot at least 18 errors.
[40:24.91]I don't even know what the fuck this means.
[40:29.51]18 errors.
[40:34.63]Oh, God, it's a fucking one of these things.
[40:37.58]There's more than that.
[40:39.12]See what I'm saying?
[40:42.68]These are just like...
[41:03.80]This is just like dumb puzzle shit.
[41:10.06]I'm like weirdly in frame here, hold on.
[41:17.17]That's better.
[41:17.83]Keep the UFOs away, let's go.
[41:41.00]You dick!
[41:42.16]Oh, the waist.
[41:59.95]Let's play hockey with the animals.
[42:02.21]That should be fun.
[42:08.43]Shoot six animals and match the examples.
[42:12.51]What?
[42:12.77]Oh, okay.
[42:16.69]What?
[42:17.15]Oh, wait, what?
[42:21.31]Okay, I did it.
[42:24.15]That was genuine anchor.
[42:28.71]It really was.
[42:33.82]I get riled up when I play these games, man, I swear to God.
[42:36.00]You think it's a joke?
[42:41.39]Set up the fireworks.
[42:42.33]I did this, remember when I did this first try last time?
[42:45.23]Who's fucking texting me?
[42:47.79]What do you want?
[42:49.97]I don't get time for that.
[42:51.33]Let's do it again.
[43:11.38]Shoot from outside, I'm not going outside to shoot through the window into the game.
[43:20.44]Fucking plastic oil.
[43:23.02]Like there's a screen on this window.
[43:25.58]And plus guys, we're like 30 stories up.
[43:29.66]You want me to fucking, how am I gonna do that?
[43:31.78]Am I gonna go get a ladder and climb up on like a scaffolding and do that?
[43:37.11]No, it's not gonna work.
[43:39.58]We are like 400 feet in the air.
[43:43.75]Get a ladder.
[43:49.63]JJ Emco.
[43:51.37]JJ Emco.
[44:03.94]Why won't it see what I'm saying?
[44:05.22]What the fuck?
[44:05.92]What is going on?
[44:06.68]You see what I'm talking about now?
[44:08.48]That was just living proof that there's an issue.
[44:11.43]That was living proof.
[44:12.33]Let's do it again.
[44:23.50]Arcade.
[44:28.92]J-J-R-R-J-R.
[44:36.76]Alright.
[44:39.04]Bingo.
[44:39.72]Get it together.
[44:40.40]Am I in the right spot?
[44:41.72]I don't think I'm in the right spot for this.
[44:45.00]Oh, we're about to lose battery.
[44:47.32]Shoot all the targets.
[45:16.61]I wonder what happens when this kicks off.
[45:20.70]Actually, I don't have an idea.
[45:22.22]I'll show you guys.
[45:23.70]You wanna see?
[45:26.58]You wanna see just how you become as good as me?
[45:28.74]It's really easy.
[45:39.13]You wanna act like the best?
[45:42.15]Let me give you a quick tutorial.
[45:52.70]Fucking stupid tape.
[45:54.58]This is for you guys to learn how to be a fucking true light gun master.
[46:21.91]That's a good spot, right?
[46:23.23]What do you think?
[46:25.89]Right there?
[46:30.33]Let's give it a look.
[46:31.83]There we go.
[46:33.13]Teach you a few fucking little tricks so you can get a good point of view.
[46:38.08]Exactly how I... Here we go.
[46:51.75]Here we go, ready?
[46:54.15]Keep the vultures away.
[46:56.85]See?
[46:57.35]That's right.
[47:18.37]I did it!
[47:19.33]I did it.
[47:20.91]This needs to be like, straighter.
[47:25.39]There we go, let's get down like this.
[47:26.45]There, that's better.
[47:38.44]I didn't think this went all the way through, but it's okay.
[47:42.22]Shoot the glasses in order from top down.
[47:47.77]This is just like the old Beggin' Strips commercial.
[47:50.01]You guys are the dog notes.
[47:54.05]Joke's over.
[47:58.02]What is it on me?
[48:00.26]Get off me.
[48:19.52]I can't believe this is still on.
[48:22.27]Alright, time to try it.
[48:25.57]I'm gonna give this one the true try, you know what I mean?
[48:28.85]Really try it, actually try it.
[48:32.17]Shoot at least 35 toy mice.
[48:33.94]This one beat me last time, not here.
[48:36.50]20 seconds.
[49:00.13]Yes!
[49:06.42]Woo!
[49:10.46]That happened though.
[49:16.17]It was a stupid joke anyway.
[49:50.69]I can't!
[49:51.31]That's not gonna work!
[49:52.89]Just... Oh, now it looks like shit!
[50:24.21]Alright, now I gotta plug in the camera.
[50:26.03]Hold on, I got this.
[50:26.63]Wait.
[50:27.77]Just wait a second.
[50:31.33]I need a USB.
[50:33.83]I need a USB quickly.
[50:35.47]Is this gonna breach?
[50:41.80]I don't know what this is.
[50:45.28]I have to unplug this.
[50:46.14]What the fuck?
[50:47.50]Is this gonna work?
[50:48.10]Just get in there.
[50:54.58]I don't have any USBs left.
[50:58.60]How?
[50:59.62]Yes, I do.
[51:01.80]Get the fuck in there.
[51:06.46]Get in!
[51:08.68]Alright, we're good.
[51:11.66]Charging.
[51:14.04]Whoo!
[51:20.66]And just like that, the problem was solved.
[51:26.64]This probably looks so blue, it looks like shit.
[51:29.18]We're good, I don't even worry about it.
[51:36.85]Criminals, criminals.
[51:39.37]Oh no, that looks so bad.
[51:40.89]There's like a fan in the background.
[51:42.49]Bitch, get out of the way.
[52:09.43]I'm all, like, flustered and shit.
[52:11.76]What a break.
[52:13.22]Wait, it's delayed?
[52:14.04]What do you mean it's delayed?
[52:19.52]Wait, what do you mean this... It's delayed?
[52:22.36]Wait, is it really?
[52:27.59]Hold on.
[52:28.51]The video's behind the audio?
[52:32.61]Wait a second.
[52:38.86]I wonder about how much.
[52:39.94]What?
[52:45.94]What?
[52:47.88]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[52:49.96]Bang.
[52:50.98]Bang.
[52:54.66]Oh, you're baiting me.
[52:55.74]I don't even know what I just did.
[52:58.50]At least 18 targets.
[53:04.06]Don't worry.
[53:04.44]Well, this camera only has to be here for like 20 minutes.
[53:35.08]is a long way down hey hey fuck you cars like fucking 30 stories up I can't you guys are crazy
[54:13.25]Nice joke, you teenager.

[54:16.30]You want me to do it?
[54:27.79]I'll go out there.
[54:30.71]How funny would that be?
[54:32.89]I missed.
[54:33.09]Apparently, I missed.
[54:39.92]That's a long way down.
[54:41.20]Hold on.
[54:41.46]Give me a minute.
[54:46.02]Can I pause the game here?
[54:47.50]I'm gonna try pausing the game a minute.
[54:57.77]Should release 25 criminals.
[54:59.03]Let's see if I can pause the game.
[55:00.78]No, you can't.
[55:34.29]Alright, hold on.
[55:34.73]Give me, give me, let me, let me, let me like, I think we're almost done here.
[55:37.65]Let me wrap this up.
[55:38.91]There's only like a few more to go.
[55:41.02]Let's try this one.
[55:45.72]RNG gun spread.
[55:47.42]That's what it feels like right now.
[55:51.02]Collect 13 bombs.
[55:52.06]I've got infinity bullets, 25 seconds.
[56:22.68]Alright.
[56:37.07]It's like a bunch of streetlights out here and shit.
[56:45.69]That's fucking far.
[56:49.16]Stay right there.
[56:51.04]I gotta get like climbing shoes.
[57:11.39]I need like the Spider-Man suction cups.
[59:21.86]Whoa.
[59:25.74]Oh, shit.
[59:30.26]Whoa.
[59:36.45]Fucking God.
[59:39.01]What?
[60:13.47]This is not a good idea.
[60:16.24]Look at the fucking strength of this boy, huh?
[60:19.76]Look how strong this boy is.
[60:23.70]Oh, fuck.
[60:24.24]I'm going to knock something up.
[60:25.84]Yeah, I climbed back up.
[60:27.12]No big deal.
[60:28.04]Landed on a tent.
[60:31.27]My pants are going to come off.
[60:35.99]And then I'm going to get arrested.
[60:50.73]Alright, let's keep going.
[60:58.31]Let's play.
[61:03.76]Alright, shoot.
[61:06.80]What's going on here?
[61:16.40]Oh, he dropped 40, yeah, I dropped fucking 30 stories.
[61:19.90]Did like one of those like Aladdin's where I landed on the tent and some tent vendor was like, get out of here and like threw me back up and I went, whoa, and I grabbed onto the side of the fucking house.
[61:29.67]It's not that hard to believe.
[61:35.85]Fucking, I like hurt my hand.
[61:37.35]I like contorted my hand on the tent.
[61:54.45]Show!
[62:20.37]Somebody, somebody told me that world was gonna fucking roll me.
[62:26.37]Yeah, that fucking meme song.
[62:28.23]Alright, like, let's play again.
[62:29.45]Do another outside joke.
[62:37.25]That was it.
[62:38.39]Shoot the cork with one shot.
[62:42.09]I'll try.
[62:52.92]Read this if it's recorded.
[62:54.14]Yeah, it is, there you go.
[63:02.46]I just, I can't, fuck.
[63:04.05]Those of you guys that were hearing the last light gun scream when I was like fucking killing it.
[63:10.67]Not today apparently, I don't have it today.
[63:12.59]I called in fucking sick today apparently.
[63:20.03]Make at least 11 statues identical to the examples.
[63:24.69]I don't understand.
[63:32.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[63:34.08]The head.
[63:38.44]I got his head.
[63:42.52]I swear to God something feels not right here.
[63:45.42]That was clearly in the head.
[63:51.86]Like, that's, you see what I'm saying, right?
[63:55.60]That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[63:56.74]What's going on here?
[63:59.20]That was literally directly in his head.
[64:00.76]Is this game like buggy?
[64:04.70]I don't understand.
[64:07.59]The last one wasn't like this.
[64:08.65]I don't remember this one being like that.
[64:14.67]Restart.
[64:15.79]I already recalibrated the gun.
[64:16.99]I think it's just the game's a little... Blame it on the game.
[64:19.50]Blame it on the game.
[64:20.74]0.3 seconds.
[64:21.00]Let's go.
[64:29.87]You're like dirt all over me.
[64:30.85]Do I have dirt all over my back?
[64:34.15]Can you tell?
[64:45.63]Point blank three is better than this.
[64:48.40]We'll be seeing that shortly.
[64:50.95]Shoot at least 42 targets, okay.
[65:17.26]How did I get dirt on me if I landed on the tent?
[65:18.91]I don't know, it was like some residue on the tent.
[65:23.91]I wish there was a camera out there so you could see how fucking crazy that was.
[65:28.47]That was absolutely insane.
[65:32.75]The camera's lagging.
[65:33.73]Well, we're gonna get the original camera in a minute, don't worry.
[65:46.66]I swear to God, something ain't right here.
[66:00.39]Fast is kind of the West.
[66:01.93]I said West.
[66:02.51]I don't know what you said.
[66:17.10]holding a plastic gun like it's real.
[66:19.88]Come on, man.
[66:21.50]It is real.
[66:22.90]We're really shooting at real targets.
[66:27.34]It is real.
[66:28.08]It's shooting the pixel with this camera.
[66:31.20]I kind of want to just play point blank three.
[66:35.15]I feel like it's better.
[66:38.21]See if I'm insane or not.
[66:40.39]Try this one.
[66:40.81]We'll do one more now.
[66:42.51]Should I just play point blank three?
[66:53.76]Let's count and see if he'll react.
[66:56.55]Rent-a-cuff.
[66:57.87]Jack's the Rent-a-cuff.
[66:59.09]You saw it here.
[67:05.43]We'll do point blank three.
[67:06.44]Why not?
[67:06.80]How long have we been streaming for?
[67:07.72]A little over an hour.
[67:09.12]Let's see.
[67:12.82]We can also do this too.
[67:14.12]Eh.
[67:14.28]I don't even think.
[67:15.20]Point blank three.
[67:15.94]Let's do it.
[67:22.35]I love Point Blank 3.
[67:23.11]It's like the best.
[67:24.95]It's like the best.
[67:27.15]Okay, you know, let's go one more time.
[67:30.35]One more on Point Blank 2.
[67:32.93]Oh, you guys can like see the games down there.
[67:39.47]Uh-oh, spoilers.
[67:50.43]Oh no, this one's on insane.
[67:51.89]This is the shoot the difference thing.
[67:53.51]Why did it shoot at least 18 errors?
[67:58.84]Fuck.
[68:20.96]There were no errors!
[68:23.26]There were no errors!
[68:26.11]There were no errors!
[68:27.55]There were no errors!
[68:51.77]Ugh.
[68:53.27]Shoot the bulldozer 99 times.
[68:55.67]This is the one on insane.
[68:57.75]Check in 20 seconds.
[68:59.33]Eat shit.
[69:12.68]I can still do that.
[69:25.35]Watch your eyes.
[69:29.96]I hate these ones.
[69:30.88]I really do.
[69:32.68]I really don't like these ones.
[69:38.98]Shoot and get at least 570 points.
[69:52.19]What the fuck was, what the fuck was that?
[69:54.65]They just, okay.
[69:58.27]They just flash in the middle for a second.
[70:00.11]I didn't know that.
[70:06.31]Nine and nine and a half equals 8.25 shots a second.
[70:11.34]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[70:13.48]Maybe a little bit faster than that.
[70:17.76]Like, you ever see The Three Amigos?
[70:19.43]When Martin Short is like, no, no, I am that fast.
[70:22.55]And the guy's like, no, they're fucking camera tricks.
[70:24.83]It's like, no, I am that fast.
[70:58.38]The old door camera trick.
[71:00.12]What?
[71:00.34]Why am I stroking this?
[71:02.64]I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[71:11.91]I gotta get you guys some good images, right?
[71:13.57]Some good Photoshop images.
[71:15.37]There you go.
[71:15.87]What do I have to do?
[71:20.93]What do I have to do?
[71:21.88]Criminal!
[71:23.00]Criminal!
[71:32.73]Get a good thumbnail.
[71:34.20]Yeah.
[71:39.36]I think we're almost ready to put the camera back, the good camera.
[71:42.10]When we move on to point blank three, we'll change the camera.
[71:50.17]It is delayed.
[71:50.81]Well, it won't be in about 15 minutes.
[71:55.09]Shoot at the targets as they flash.
[71:56.65]Make it happen.
[72:03.54]Dude, what the fuck?
[72:04.77]Oh, fucking God.
[72:06.89]He has one?
[72:07.57]What do I have?
[72:33.27]She's the light in my room.
[72:34.99]Why?
[72:39.40]I miss Jex.
[72:40.34]I do too.
[72:43.10]Jex has a better diet apparently.
[72:45.68]He eats like fresh fish and fucking vegetables.
[72:48.30]Jeremy eats milkshakes and fucking oil.
[73:19.22]I don't think I'm crazy.
[73:21.86]Well, I might be.
[73:25.45]I'm going to lose this one by a thousand percent.
[73:33.63]Jax is back.
[73:34.47]No, not quite.
[73:34.84]Not quite.
[73:56.86]What the fuck, man?
[74:06.48]Playing the good one.
[74:11.88]I'm playing the one that I like.
[74:13.06]That second one was made by a different shitty dev team.
[74:22.73]Unspeakable.
[74:35.40]We're playing it.
[74:36.30]The good one.
[74:36.84]I don't want to break this, though.
[74:40.70]Channel your energy.
[74:47.78]If that's not like a calm down Jeremy, I don't know what is.
[74:54.54]Fresh out of the factory.
[75:02.97]I don't like to break the seal.
[75:09.05]I don't like to break the seal.
[75:12.24]I like having... Alright, let me look at the... Alright, hold on a second.
[75:17.88]Let's see how long this is charged.
[75:19.82]It's been about like 30 minutes, right?
[75:21.48]Let's see if we can get a whole... Alright, here we go.
[75:24.68]Switch it out.
[75:27.61]Turn this one off.
[75:32.93]Wait, what?
[75:34.33]Oh, no, that was me.
[75:37.49]What the fuck is going on right now?
[75:39.39]Oh, okay.
[75:39.67]Here we go.
[75:42.43]Just like that, we swap this one up.
[75:45.91]Okay.
[75:47.84]You guys aren't seeing the really cute intro.
[75:52.40]Who said I wasn't a fucking professional?
[76:02.35]Who said it?
[76:02.89]Who said it?
[76:10.75]Who said I wasn't afraid?
[76:36.48]I'm like, dang, look.
[76:38.12]It's like on red battery too.
[76:39.90]God damn it.
[76:40.60]Okay.
[76:44.81]Get dumb hair out of the way.
[76:45.81]I'm going to take a pair of scissors and just go.
[76:48.82]Wipe line three.
[77:07.92]That's probably so odd looking.
[77:09.18]Alright, endurance, arcade, training, party, arcade.
[77:14.98]This game is fucking awesome, I love this game.
[77:19.19]Turn it up a little bit.
[77:23.29]The beginner.
[77:25.45]Just to get ourselves warmed up.
[77:27.91]This is a little off.
[77:35.12]That's better.
[77:40.72]Alright, 16 stages.
[77:42.42]This is shoot at least 30 buffaloes.
[78:04.65]That's easy.
[78:11.94]Accuracy could be a little better, but that's okay.
[78:17.18]Buffalo are endangered, are they?
[78:19.20]Shoot the target with one shot.
[78:20.62]Here we go.
[78:20.91]One shot, 12 seconds.
[78:28.96]I thought it was him!
[78:29.64]I thought I had to shoot him!
[78:30.54]I thought I had to shoot him right in the stomach.
[78:37.03]Alright, well I know for next time.
[78:44.11]Shoot all the targets.
[78:44.79]Okay.
[78:44.95]I have 28 seconds.
[79:11.51]That's new, I don't know that.
[79:19.42]So it's probably like one of those match three, is this a match three game?
[79:23.68]Shoot at least nine targets identical to the sample.
[79:28.06]Okay.
[79:57.16]Wow, I love the vocals in the ending.
[80:00.58]It's great.
[80:01.38]Alright, here's another one.
[80:06.48]12 stages left.
[80:08.02]Shoot the target to score at least 420 points.
[80:10.40]Okay, this one is in the middle.
[80:11.84]Shoot it in the middle six times.
[80:20.69]Oh, he didn't get it.
[80:21.93]He didn't get it.
[80:22.61]He did get it.
[80:29.63]Why are you guys saying 420?
[80:30.47]420 for what?
[80:31.21]16 targets.
[80:31.81]Not shoot the bombs.
[80:36.55]No bullet women.
[81:12.36]Mess up.
[81:12.90]What?
[81:13.12]If somebody's putting all caps, mess up.
[81:15.01]You can't do that.
[81:16.25]I can't see that.
[81:21.87]Another hip stream with quality games.
[81:23.67]This is, this is, what the fuck?
[81:24.83]This is the fuck?
[81:25.39]This is a quality game.
[81:27.91]This is like a fantastic classic video game.
[81:30.73]Come on.
[81:32.05]What do you want about it?
[81:33.77]Shoot 18 targets.
[81:59.84]This game is cool.
[82:00.59]This is a high quality video game.
[82:06.75]I'm getting radiation from the TV. 17.
[82:46.71]Oh, man, my brain is so slow tonight.
[82:50.27]You guys, do you really ever get that way?
[82:51.57]Like, do you guys sometimes just your brain is fucking sludge for like a day?
[82:57.33]I'm just total fucking sludge right now.
[83:06.75]Like, I shoot the thing on the screen.
[83:10.70]Like, Jesus Christ.
[83:16.88]I'm beginning to get, like, sprayed in the face.
[83:19.48]Like a, you know what I mean?
[83:20.24]Like, spray me in the face with a bottle.
[83:23.76]Shoot, 16 cans.
[83:29.27]Oh god, I get it.
[83:31.85]Oh my god, holy shit.
[83:46.65]I did not do that.
[83:47.45]That was something, whatever.
[83:49.02]That was impossible.
[83:54.22]Spray it in the face.
[83:55.06]Yeah, I just need, I need someone just to fucking just like, just crack and like wake me up.
[84:03.75]Oh, he burns.
[84:31.32]I must look like I have knowledge of the game to the aliens
[85:09.09]He looks like a soccer fan.
[85:12.45]I could be.
[85:13.21]I could be a soccer fan.
[85:14.09]Look at that bicep.
[85:19.79]Shoot the train 24 times, Liz, by the way.
[85:29.94]I mean... Those are always so easy for me.
[85:32.66]Why can't they all be those ones?
[85:42.01]Alright, let's do this one.
[85:48.72]26 targets.
[85:51.28]I think I know how this one works.
[85:55.98]Oh, Jesus Christ, no I don't.
[86:15.24]I did not understand that one, apparently.
[86:20.39]Ah, this is the symphony one.
[86:24.05]Why do I feel like a slug?
[86:25.27]I feel like a slug because... I don't know, my sleep has been fucking terrible lately.
[86:30.94]Shoot down thrown objects.
[86:52.83]I'm like crouching down.
[86:53.89]Look at this shit.
[86:57.93]Am I playing banjo?
[87:01.08]That guy's terrible.
[87:06.08]Insane.
[87:09.16]This is a book.
[87:12.27]This is not the line.
[87:28.95]Which one is it?
[87:33.14]I'm never eating this bread ever again.
[87:44.49]I'm only eating fresh vegetables from now on.
[87:51.40]Last one, and then we're going to do advanced.
[87:53.08]And I'm going to recalibrate again, because I'm eternally going to do that a thousand times tonight.
[87:57.45]Shoot the monsters.
[87:58.15]20 seconds.
[88:31.11]The banjo was mentioned on stream.
[88:44.71]I'll never do that again.
[88:52.56]Final stage.
[88:53.20]Well, final stage of this, uh... Concentrates the stamina, dexterity, brain power.
[89:01.10]83 stages.
[89:03.66]Superior marksmanship.
[89:04.86]No, it's not.
[89:05.32]Not good enough.
[89:06.64]I can do better than that.
[89:07.48]I can't.
[89:10.18]Enter your name within 20 seconds.
[89:11.90]Gone.
[89:12.28]How about, um...
[89:34.25]Why?
[89:38.65]Cat.
[89:39.69]Oh, I got it.
[89:43.25]Oh, I'm safe.
[89:45.13]Oh, we don't have battery.
[89:48.92]Almost dead.
[89:50.36]Let's see if I can do one more without dying.
[90:10.46]See, that's like moving around like that.
[90:37.34]Good enough.
[90:38.04]TV has curves, yeah.
[90:41.88]It's because it's an old grandma TV.
[90:44.80]Let's try it again.
[90:47.56]I want to see some more of the other stages we haven't seen.
[90:55.93]Try advanced.
[90:56.49]Oh, come on.
[90:57.07]Give me some more battery power so I don't have to go to the emergency one.
[91:00.68]Alright, this one is the train.
[91:03.84]We'll get this one.
[91:05.97]This is pretty much guaranteed that I'll get this.
[91:08.57]Just shoot it 50 fucking times.
[91:13.30]Eight seconds.
[91:23.34]Wow, that's like impossible.
[91:26.26]Oh my God, that's so impossible.
[91:29.68]It's so far away, like you'll never get that.
[91:32.42]You have to have like, you can't be a human to beat that one.
[91:35.69]Holy shit.
[91:37.92]80, 50 fucking times.
[91:39.06]I probably could have got it.
[91:39.79]I'll get it.
[91:40.31]Fucking Wheaties.
[92:07.55]Yeah, you have to put the gun on the TV, but even still, you have to be like, one, two, three, four, five.
[92:12.79]That seems like impossible.
[92:28.16]I don't have time for this.
[92:29.22]I don't have time for this, man.
[92:32.00]I don't have time for this.
[92:36.38]I don't have time for this.
[92:39.01]What do I have to do?
[92:49.39]Where is it?
[93:02.77]I'm fucking tied to this shit.
[93:12.92]It's like tilted.
[93:13.74]It's like not even facing the right direction.
[93:20.17]What the fuck dude?
[93:22.41]It's like all fucked up.
[93:23.71]I didn't even plug the other one in.
[93:27.19]I can't, we gotta wait till after.
[93:30.08]And this one's like delayed, hold on.
[93:40.21]I'll take that.
[93:44.11]So wait, the video on this is happening first.
[93:55.27]So the TV is delayed.
[94:05.32]See what happens if I do that.
[94:06.46]Did I just fuck it up?
[94:09.50]I probably just made it even worse.
[94:12.95]Shoot the ninja with one shot.
[94:14.43]I didn't even know what the fuck was trying to do.
[94:19.47]I'm so distracted by this stupid shit.
[94:37.96]I think we're just gonna have to stay with this TV for the rest of it.
[94:41.56]Shoot all the bottles, 58.
[94:42.42]12 seconds.
[94:42.82]It's synced up now?
[95:07.74]Is it actually synced up?
[95:08.74]No.
[95:11.56]Let's play Blackjack.
[95:16.69]Shoot at least 10 cards with the highest value.
[95:19.51]Oh, no.
[95:22.83]I didn't even see it.
[95:28.68]Oh, boy.
[95:47.87]That's how blackjack goes.
[95:48.91]Yeah, blackjack goes... That's a classic blackjack hand.
[95:55.12]I can't, I really can't do numbers that quickly.
[95:59.04]I gotta focus on this one.
[96:26.98]Man, oh man.
[96:28.36]Now I'm just getting frustrated.
[96:38.91]I forgot how hard this shit really was when you play on the hardest difficulties.
[96:41.85]I didn't even get a fucking present either.
[96:49.25]Didn't even get a present.
[96:57.66]I'm like, oh, look at this fucking core in here.
[97:00.34]Oh, my God.
[97:00.62]I just want to spike him to the ground.
[97:09.32]Shoot the targets to help Dr. Don and Dr. Dan climb to the top.
[97:11.65]28 seconds.
[97:40.28]Oh.
[97:40.94]I don't even, I just barely understood what the fuck was going on halfway through that.
[97:48.09]Whew.
[97:49.75]Let's try this one.
[97:57.55]I just need to find a machine gun to do it.
[98:03.26]I'm playing at least four letters.
[98:04.68]What, what am I doing?
[98:28.38]It's too late now.
[98:30.56]You know, here's the thing though.
[98:31.76]I really shouldn't be playing this on advanced until I like see, I have no idea what the hell's going on and how many stages.
[98:37.49]I really should play this on like the beginner stages to even know what the stages are before I play them on the hardest difficulty.
[99:08.59]Here comes the boss, playing Metal Slug.
[99:11.49]Metal Slug is awesome.
[99:14.34]They made like 12 Metal Slugs, didn't they?
[99:18.34]This is wrong.
[99:19.08]This is fucking wrong.
[99:21.12]Wrong!
[99:48.17]I can't seem to do it.
[100:18.30]I like turn.
[100:19.50]Freeze!
[100:22.52]Shoot at least 8 o'clock showing the time identical to the sample.
[100:25.30]10.30.
[100:28.40]10.30 AR.
[100:36.71]4.15.
[100:36.73]Where are you?
[100:37.07]Yeah!
[100:37.31]11.45.
[100:37.41]Oh, I need it.
[100:45.92]I needed more vitamins today.
[100:48.28]350, that's nine.
[101:02.81]Clocks are hard.
[101:05.15]This one looks different.
[101:16.23]Shoot all the tanks.
[101:17.09]Maybe 25.
[101:18.09]13 seconds.
[101:20.55]That's not a lot of time.
[101:35.20]Holy shit, that's incredibly hard.
[101:42.45]They don't make it insane for no reason.
[101:52.92]Let's go, what happened?
[101:56.92]What happened?
[101:58.40]Oh my god, dammit.
[102:03.36]Okay.
[102:05.84]I just like, cracked it down.
[102:09.49]Oh my fucking god.
[102:11.27]I'm just like, fire, smash the glass!
[102:13.49]Oh well.
[102:18.41]One shot, don't even fucking look, just shoot it right now, one, two, three!
[102:31.51]Did they say not to shoot the glass?
[102:32.82]I don't think so.
[102:41.12]I want to do it on beginner.
[102:42.88]I feel like we're getting kind of screwed.
[102:44.78]Because these are the levels that I haven't seen or played, and we're just losing to them.
[102:52.61]Let's just, let's see the stages.
[102:56.73]Okay.
[102:57.85]Do it like, get familiar with what's even going on.
[103:00.17]Because I have no fucking idea what's happening.
[103:05.97]Is that Bert and Ernie?
[103:06.77]It looks like Bert and Ernie.
[103:13.27]We're doing beginner.
[103:13.96]Because I, I, I, baby streamer plays on beginner.
[103:18.16]No, Baby Streamer needs to understand what the levels are before he does the hardest difficulty.
[103:28.83]That's good.
[103:36.08]It's like 500.
[103:36.50]100%.
[103:37.04]It's not that hard to be 100% accurate.
[103:39.74]In that realm.
[103:44.46]Why do I look like Kylo Ren?
[103:46.18]That's a great question.
[104:15.38]He looks like Kylo Ren.
[104:19.49]Do you feel that?
[104:20.15]Do you feel it?
[104:21.81]I feel it in you.
[104:25.71]And I'll start breaking shit, too, like Kylo Ren.
[104:29.91]Oh, I know.
[104:30.48]Yes.
[104:31.00]I feel it, too.
[104:50.37]Now I just need to start smashing things in this room.
[104:55.69]Alright.
[104:56.11]Shoot at least 20 skeleton sharks.
[104:58.39]Sure.
[104:59.15]I'd like it if this could get off me.
[105:30.28]What the fuck?
[105:33.02]Smash the window.
[105:33.96]I'm not going to smash my window.
[105:35.96]What are you talking about?
[105:37.04]You want to put my hand through my window?
[105:39.76]Why?
[105:40.12]44 targets, no bombs.
[106:13.96]cause a problem I'll cause a huge problem if I do that shoot 16 targets with flashing order what
[107:02.46]I'm gonna put on another shirt.
[107:04.08]Can I swim through this one?
[107:05.02]A little bit, maybe.
[107:06.80]Just a little bit.
[107:07.64]Just a tad.
[107:08.22]That was a good Simon Says.
[107:14.00]Certainly sturdy buffaloes.
[107:16.06]I'll try.
[107:41.27]Porcelain buffaloes?
[107:42.65]Yeah, they were made out of glass.
[107:44.67]Just about.
[107:50.60]Yeah, baby difficulty is on.
[107:52.64]I need to get my groove back.
[108:23.09]These are rickety numbers.
[108:25.85]Don't worry.
[108:27.51]We'll go back to advanced after this.
[108:28.97]I'm just seeing more of these stages.
[108:31.74]I guess it's gonna be hard to do that.
[108:33.36]Not even gonna look.
[108:33.94]One, two, three, shoot.
[108:34.64]Don't even know what I did.
[108:37.46]Apparently not.
[108:38.00]I gotta get my mojo.
[108:46.45]Yeah, I gotta get my light gun mojo back.
[108:50.70]Let's go with, nah, this one is so, I don't like, the one where you throw the cans in the guy's bucket.
[108:57.27]That's super, super hard.
[108:58.65]Shoot down the targets.
[108:59.85]Okay, this one you have to shoot them before they come near him.
[109:33.81]Do I have Time Crisis?
[109:34.71]I have Time Crisis 1.
[109:35.41]We played it last time.
[109:38.64]It was old.
[109:40.68]That's the best way I can describe that.
[109:42.00]Time Crisis is old.
[109:43.32]Very old.
[109:44.18]By a large model.
[109:49.63]Alright.
[109:51.09]Shoot at least 12 targets of your own color.
[109:52.69]Everything spins around it looks like.
[110:16.97]Big pixels.
[110:17.59]Bang, bang, bang.
[110:24.26]I think it's early.
[110:28.80]Is the camera early now?
[111:01.89]I just almost didn't do that why has nobody rescued this man what's wrong with me what did I do 16 birds
[111:43.18]Alright, last four, then we go back to advanced.
[111:50.49]What is this one?
[111:53.99]Reminds me of Earthworm, keep the barrels away.
[111:57.50]Oh, I'm back.
[111:58.04]Why is there another screen?
[112:21.61]the second player?
[112:22.29]I was thinking it would be funny if I got two gun cons and had to go with both hands out.
[112:31.32]It would be excruciating.
[112:34.96]I'm actually glad I didn't do that.
[112:36.48]That'd be so hard to pull off.
[112:37.50]Shoot the targets.
[112:40.44]No time limit.
[112:41.06]I mean, there is a time limit.
[113:05.41]it next week uh we got a lot of Dreamcast I want to play kingdom come deliverance though that is I'm probably gonna take a break from old console ship this in a couple days the next stream we're gonna do probably kingdom come deliverance and I kind of have to right
[113:35.16]She stole my grandma's TV.
[113:36.26]And she ain't getting it back.
[113:41.55]Last one, and then we're gonna do advanced.
[113:42.87]I have no legs.
[113:48.61]Complete at least two letters or...
[114:03.73]What does an eight look like?
[114:04.51]What does an eight look like?
[114:09.47]Like that.
[114:12.15]I got it, whatever.
[114:16.17]Oh, that's what it looks like.
[114:20.50]Thanks, guys.
[114:20.96]Appreciate it.
[114:22.68]That's what an eight looks like.
[114:26.58]Back to advanced.
[114:27.26]Let me shake these fucking cobwebs out.
[114:40.71]Get him back in town!
[114:43.73]Call the officer, he's back.
[114:45.39]You hear any shit on your grandmother?
[115:09.25]What are you talking about?
[115:11.92]Alright, that's good.
[115:13.36]Now let's do that on the dance.
[115:16.40]It is the same difficulty on the dance on that stage though.
[115:21.70]My brain power is so low always.
[115:25.68]Concentration, stamina, judgment, my rhythm is not that great, dexterity, brain power is always three.
[115:35.87]Always three points for brain power.
[115:38.49]Just like life.
[115:43.11]Alright, Jex is back.
[115:45.60]J-I-B.
[115:49.34]Jex is back.
[115:55.33]Still advanced.
[115:56.69]He's back.
[115:57.23]The confidence is back.
[115:58.31]That's all I needed.
[115:58.89]I need a little bit of confidence.
[115:59.83]I need to do something right.
[116:11.24]I'm back.
[116:11.94]Let's do it.
[116:12.42]I'm ready to fuckin' crush Advanced.
[116:13.90]I'm gonna hold the gun like this.
[116:22.66]I saw somebody who really liked the arcades, they're like... Alright, let's get back in fuckin' town here.
[116:28.97]Advanced.
[116:30.57]Alright, let's do it.
[116:36.11]Start with the slimes.
[116:37.19]I got this one easy last time.
[116:38.67]Make it happen.
[116:41.88]Shoot all the slimes.
[116:44.92]Jax is back!
[117:15.82]30 targets.
[117:19.24]Reporting for duty.
[117:49.51]What's this?
[117:55.07]Get the confidence back.
[117:55.91]Here we go.
[117:56.25]This is a single shot.
[117:58.01]Jax never misses this shit.
[117:59.73]Never.
[118:00.39]I never will.
[118:01.41]Three, two, one, Jax won't miss.
[118:03.64]He doesn't get fooled that easily.
[118:16.46]That target was foppin' tiny.
[118:21.30]Oh shit!
[118:21.86]I don't know if I know how to tell time on advanced!
[118:25.86]Shit!
[118:28.32]Ten o'clock!
[118:30.04]Which one?
[118:43.11]2.15, where is it?
[118:44.29]That's 2.30, you fucking idiot!
[118:50.27]I didn't do it.
[118:59.60]I fucking killed it.
[119:01.16]Oh my god.
[119:02.20]There's just too many clocks!
[119:03.48]There's too many clocks on the screen!
[119:15.32]It's too many clocks.
[119:17.08]But, Jax can take this one.
[119:36.27]Wow, I thought I could, yeah, I got it.
[119:38.19]Jax is back.
[119:46.34]He ejects the handle.
[119:49.26]I don't even know what this one is.
[119:54.73]Shoot at least 10 soccer balls.
[119:56.54]I have 16 shots.
[120:18.08]Did I get 10?
[120:20.70]See?
[120:25.65]That's the reason why I wore this shirt today.
[120:31.23]Shoot the audience member accidentally.
[120:33.21]Shoot down missiles to protect the base.
[120:35.31]Okay, 20 seconds.
[121:06.01]you're imagining me in the arcade and everyone's giving me weird looks am I like the creepy guy at the arcade that's like taking the game way too seriously 30 birds
[121:43.99]Yeah, a little.
[121:44.83]I'm just taking it too seriously.
[121:48.14]I gotta, like, slow down.
[121:54.34]Playing the same game?
[121:55.10]Yeah, we're playing point blank tonight.
[121:56.52]That was what I wanted to do.
[121:57.26]I want to play point blank two, point blank one.
[122:01.02]Are we gonna eat it?
[122:03.56]What's in there?
[122:04.34]Point.
[122:09.95]This was the plan for today.
[122:15.56]How does this work?
[122:17.24]Oh man, I'm aiming at an old shitty TV.
[122:23.00]Let's do this one.
[122:27.52]32 people have to be shot.
[122:29.21]32 criminals.
[122:30.79]32 bad guys.
[122:53.38]That's fucked up.
[122:54.68]Like, literally, like, half of those just weren't even hitting.
[122:57.30]That was fucking stupid.
[122:58.30]That's angering.
[123:00.58]They were just, like, going to the... Whatever.
[123:03.08]You know, there's nothing I can do about that.
[123:08.17]Ah.
[123:11.83]Shoot at least 32 targets in numerical order.
[123:16.93]Ah.
[123:29.43]Come on.
[123:41.28]I swear to God.
[123:44.48]It's half the time that it just doesn't wanna work.
[123:46.60]I don't know why.
[123:48.86]Jax is like taking a shit in the bathtub right now.
[124:12.41]I SHOT IT, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
[124:18.20]In the tub.
[124:18.70]Yeah, he's spawning over the tub.
[124:24.68]Oh, I hate this one.
[124:30.27]Four.
[124:30.55]I have to do four of them.
[124:31.41]Okay, that's not that bad.
[124:32.25]How much time?
[124:38.83]What?
[124:39.37]What was that?
[124:39.83]It was a seven!
[125:03.55]F?
[125:04.13]That was a seven!
[125:05.23]That was clearly a seven!
[125:07.03]That was a seven!
[125:08.03]Alright, let's get Jekt back in here.
[125:20.34]Shoot at least 25 of your own targets.

[126:31.67]Got him on the way fucking down.
[126:40.31]I'm gonna wreck the TV.
[126:41.09]This TV's weird.
[126:43.21]Sometimes it doesn't turn on.
[126:44.97]Keep the cannonballs away.
[126:51.30]I thought that was a shrapnel!
[127:11.08]Oh, I thought that was a... Fuck.
[127:15.12]Oh, I thought that was a piece of shrapnel from the other one.
[127:17.40]I didn't even see it was behind... Ah, it's... God damn it, it's just... This is the thing where it's... I'm gonna fuck this up.
[127:46.82]You son of a bitch.
[127:49.09]You gotta get them all.
[127:56.24]I did what I was doing fucking really well until right now.
[128:00.62]Alright, come on, let's get them all.
[128:03.58]All the fireworks.
[128:26.54]Didn't get S, fuck.
[128:29.20]Extra brain power that time, don't ask me how.
[128:34.73]Let's do it again.
[128:56.81]That shitty lizard from PlayStation 2.
[129:02.73]Have some brain fluid.
[129:05.28]I didn't have enough rhythm that time.
[129:07.64]I don't really.
[129:15.54]Gex isn't shitty?
[129:16.44]How in the way did Gex... Gex is terrible.
[129:21.66]Gex is the worst.
[129:23.66]He's the...
[129:25.09]Gex is just the James Bond Geico lizard.
[129:31.40]That ain't, that's not that, that's not, the Geico lizard's not cool.
[129:35.62]And neither was the duck.
[129:43.59]Gex's shitty brother, Gex.
[129:48.18]This is the elevated one.
[129:49.00]I had trouble with this one last time.
[129:51.17]Let's see if I can't blow it again.
[129:53.09]26 villains, no civilians.
[129:55.83]20 seconds.
[130:02.32]Holy, it's so fast!
[130:18.10]Oh my god, no way, that's outrageous.
[130:21.42]I still did it, but holy shit, I shot a lot of random people.
[130:27.56]Holy god.
[130:30.12]It's just like .
[130:32.54]You need more brain power than that.
[130:33.95]I don't have it.
[130:36.07]Shoot at least 14 targets identical to the sample.
[130:38.27]This one's gonna suck too.
[130:39.35]How long do I have?
[130:39.91]20 seconds.
[130:48.31]Shoot it, you fucking idiot!
[130:49.55]I had, come on.
[130:54.97]Close.
[130:55.31]60, new high record, new high score.
[131:14.08]I'm gonna have to go rapid fire on this one.
[131:16.68]What do you think?
[131:18.06]45 buffalos, I gotta do it.
[131:19.72]Got unlimited shots, right?
[131:21.90]Let's do it.
[131:34.45]I'm losing stamina!
[131:37.89]I'm out of stamina!
[131:40.39]Fuck!
[131:40.81]Ugh!
[131:44.52]I'm gonna get a lower stamina grade.
[131:48.18]Halfway through that, I was just like, my hand wasn't working anymore.
[131:57.55]55 birds?
[131:59.28]Wow!
[132:00.98]In 20 seconds, oh god.
[132:29.73]Speed run.
[132:31.45]I am going really fast, I should slow down.
[132:34.62]That one's new.
[132:36.32]That's the worst one.
[132:37.18]Let's just say what it is.
[132:40.34]Clown man.
[132:43.15]Hit the ball with one shot, of course.
[133:02.31]New record.
[133:03.09]I really don't wanna do this one, but I'm gonna.
[133:06.42]I'm gonna have to do like 20 of these, right?
[133:10.06]Shoot 16 cans.
[133:11.62]I'm gonna try it.
[133:40.44]You ain't gonna get that one done unless you have a friend.
[133:46.34]You gotta call one of your friends over for that one.
[133:49.52]Keep the barrels away, this is the one where he's driving along.
[134:18.54]What's with the music?
[134:19.50]That's a good question.
[134:22.60]It just kind of goes crazy.
[134:23.42]You know, actually, does the Needles point-blank X?
[134:26.59]Point-blank X is now in the arcades.
[134:28.25]By the way, I'm sorry I have to, like, talk over this.
[134:31.69]Usually I'm, like, sitting down at my computer and it's easy to talk, but I'm like, hey, you know, there's a new game that's point-blank X is coming.
[134:59.97]I got real serious.
[135:05.51]You have to do it serious, man.
[135:07.97]Not on this level.
[135:08.85]In the face of total concentration.
[135:14.63]I haven't been to an arcade in years.
[135:21.63]I haven't seen an arcade in years.
[135:23.17]It's pretty bad.
[135:25.55]I guess, why would you need an arcade when you can just play everything at your house?
[135:29.52]Sad but true, right?
[135:33.10]That top left one's gonna be so difficult.
[136:06.98]VR arcades are going to be a thing?
[136:10.08]Yeah, but I miss like putting in the coins, man.
[136:13.96]I miss just throwing, grabbing like 10 bucks and going with a couple friends and just loading up on some random arcade cabinet.
[136:21.49]It's so much fun.
[136:22.15]50 targets.
[136:22.84]This is the one with the glass.
[136:52.42]Do they have any barcades in Boston?
[136:54.02]Not really.
[136:54.62]I think there's probably like one.
[136:57.47]One or two, maybe.
[137:01.75]Not that I can recall.
[137:02.63]55 targets and you're 55.
[137:24.63]How does that stem out of that one?
[137:31.13]Barcade is a great word.
[137:32.17]Yeah, it is.
[137:38.67]I'm not gonna shoot the can.
[137:39.73]I gotta shoot the fucking can for 20 seconds.
[138:04.42]DUMB STUPID PERSON!
[138:08.22]Now that one just drifted off into the curved part of the TV and I fucking lost it.
[138:19.65]I wonder how this one's gonna go in advance.
[138:23.99]It's gonna match where the count goes.
[138:50.00]One more, come on.
[138:56.47]Yikes.
[138:59.41]Hair's getting too long.
[139:00.35]I know, I'm gonna swap it off, don't worry.
[139:04.38]Another machine gun here.
[139:06.90]Shoot all the bottles, I need to hit 58.
[139:08.34]I don't know if I have another one of these lawnmower guns in me.
[139:28.43]Take a break Shoot at least 38 birds
[140:18.34]I really, I'm so upset about that.
[140:19.82]I really thought I had it.
[140:23.44]The sweet life of Kylo Ren.
[140:26.12]Stop, I need to focus.
[140:40.31]God damn it.
[140:59.57]Sweet life of Kylo Ren.
[141:01.51]I'm gonna get it this time.
[141:04.33]Just clear your mind.
[141:08.48]You understand.
[141:30.40]This is Jughead.
[141:33.41]Fucking Jughead Jones.
[141:34.93]I can't get over it.
[141:41.05]That's fucking, that's really funny.
[141:44.59]Brain power back down to three.
[141:47.02]Ah.
[142:00.17]I need to get at least one or at least four brain power.
[142:05.16]Has to happen.
[142:09.50]Man child makes fucking funny noises.
[142:27.29]I don't want to do insane, but I'm not sure I'm up to the task tonight.
[142:31.65]Alright, let's do like the weird bedroom one.
[142:38.46]Keep the mosquitoes away.
[142:39.62]Oh, I love this.
[142:40.65]I already like this one.
[142:41.55]Keep away the mosquitoes.
[143:03.40]Did I do it?
[143:03.89]Did I not do it?
[143:04.91]I did it.
[143:08.47]Jerma Ren.
[143:09.25]Alright, this one's gonna be tough.
[143:15.50]Shake it up.
[143:16.60]I'm just getting tired. 44.
[143:47.21]The music is so annoying.
[143:48.53]I know.
[143:50.45]It really is.
[143:51.79]I'm so sorry.
[143:56.95]Try the trick shot round?
[143:58.11]Oh, I could try that.
[143:59.18]Not on advanced though.
[144:01.00]I'll go to beginner and try trick shot round.
[144:03.42]That game talks.
[144:29.39]You like the music?
[144:31.72]I could see where people would probably get annoyed by it after a little while.
[144:34.86]36 targets.
[144:38.30]I'm usually okay with this one.
[145:03.85]I ran out of gas there at the end, but I got it.
[145:13.64]It only gets tiring because they reuse the tracks.
[145:15.98]Yeah.
[145:18.32]Yeah, that's true.
[145:19.86]You're right.
[145:24.41]One shot.
[145:25.13]They try to trick you a few times.
[145:26.77]See if I can make it out alive.
[145:42.56]Should I get an on-stream haircut?
[145:48.86]No, because, like, you guys... If I did an on-stream haircut, everyone would expect that I would end up with a terrible haircut.
[145:55.18]And it was going to get fucked up on purpose, and then we were going to do something weird to it.
[145:59.40]No.
[146:15.26]They're like still in cold face.
[146:17.68]God.
[146:18.02]Just do it.
[146:22.11]Go ball.
[146:25.35]This is on insane difficulty.
[146:26.75]Let's see how insane this actually is.
[146:30.13]Get 24 cans.
[146:31.97]No human can do this in 20 seconds.
[146:56.37]I was like fucking 13.
[146:57.44]I'll never beat that.
[146:58.56]Never once.
[146:59.00]Not once.
[146:59.34]I won't beat it ever.
[147:00.34]Not once.
[147:08.99]Dang it.
[147:11.73]35 targets.
[147:12.31]They climb towards you.
[147:31.45]Get it together!
[147:34.73]Just blendin' together.
[147:37.75]Like, ugh.
[147:41.01]It's just like, there's a cake in my fucking brain.
[147:44.06]Did I really beat that, Jax?
[147:50.74]Not quite.
[147:51.92]Bonus life.
[148:02.18]But you can get really, really crazy trying to perfect the game.
[148:05.32]If you play on the insane difficulties where every level is insane, oh, you can really spend a lot of time trying to get high scores here.
[148:15.25]But the game is very difficult.
[148:18.16]Shoot down thrown objects.
[148:19.42]They throw books at them, they throw pies at them, they throw boxes at them.
[148:44.46]That can almost hit him right in the head.
[148:49.62]The insane difficulty where every difficulty is insane.
[148:54.21]That's the bane of my existence is this one.
[148:55.97]Let's get it out of the way because I don't want to do it.
[148:57.41]I really don't want to do it, but whatever.
[149:00.19]I gotta get them all.
[149:19.95]He panicked!
[149:20.53]He panicked and he blew it!
[149:30.69]That one sucks.
[149:35.74]Shoot at least 21 targets.
[149:37.14]I don't think we've done this one yet.
[150:02.09]I don't think I did it.
[150:04.01]They're coming up too slowly.
[150:16.45]Too scary?
[150:18.16]It's not too scary.
[150:18.98]Just wasn't prepared for it.
[150:22.18]I also probably need to take a break.
[150:24.30]I'm gonna play a different game after this.
[150:53.80]I got the Die Hard trilogy here I want to try after this.
[150:57.30]I haven't seen this one yet.
[151:05.47]I'm gonna go grab a drink after this though, after we beat this level.
[151:08.07]All five fake Zuckers.
[151:12.49]I aimed at him and I didn't fucking get him.
[151:20.57]Yeah, the Die Hard PlayStation 4 game.
[151:24.21]It is a GunCon game, but you can't use this GunCon.
[151:26.75]It's, I guess, not compatible for some reason.
[151:29.61]Which is fucking weird, because this is the... What's the other GunCon you can make?
[151:33.95]You can do.
[151:57.10]Yeah, I need a break.
[152:01.20]My brain can only do so much of this before I'm gonna lose my mind.
[152:27.01]Move, I can't see.
[152:58.32]Alright, it's my last chance to get a ball.
[153:00.56]And then we're gonna play die hard.
[153:03.06]Come on, shoot all the time.
[153:04.10]I did it once.
[153:04.70]Do it again.
[153:06.00]Go!
[153:16.68]I didn't do it again!
[153:29.05]Got brain power at least.
[153:36.81]Red of the anthem, not red of the time.
[153:42.36]No, that's... Jug.
[153:43.22]Jug.
[153:43.82]Jim did pretty well.
[154:00.76]I want to take a look at some of the other actual games.
[154:11.85]Single Shot, Protect, Brain Teasers, Black and White Targets, Red and Blue, Brain Teasers.
[154:17.69]Where do they have the Brain Teasers?
[154:19.97]Have you seen them all?
[154:30.55]Have we seen this?
[154:31.37]Yeah, we've seen this one.
[154:32.89]Let me make sure we haven't missed anything.
[154:35.55]Protect Dr. Dom.
[154:37.05]We've seen all these.
[154:39.04]Shoot the bad guys.
[154:42.58]Single shot.
[154:43.28]I haven't done this.
[154:49.10]What is this one?
[154:50.04]Doing it the same.
[154:55.66]Shoot the one target and go four seconds.
[154:59.41]Oh wow, that's tiny.
[155:01.93]It really is right between his legs, it's this big.
[155:07.10]Wow, yo, where?
[155:11.00]Um, what is this one?
[155:15.65]Keeps track of all your data, that's cool.
[155:21.59]One shot, 10 seconds.
[155:30.05]Alright, let's go take a piss.
[155:32.63]Let me go stretch the arm out a little bit.
[155:36.09]I'm going to pull this into this screen and we're going to play Die Hard.
[155:40.55]So I'm going to be... Give me like... Give me like five minutes because it's going to be kind of weird to set this back up normally again.
[155:53.65]Yeah, give me a minute.
[155:56.35]That was Point Blank 2 and 3.
[155:58.29]I love these games.
[155:59.29]They're so much fun.
[156:01.55]I just wish I wasn't so slow today.
[156:03.02]But it's all good.
[156:04.20]Hope you enjoyed it.
[156:04.90]And give me a minute.
