[02:48.95]So if you don't know, the United States is having the presidential election tonight.
[02:56.98]It's either going to be Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
[03:02.54]And the results are coming in, like, now.
[03:05.24]Like, I turned my stream on, of course, and...
[03:08.02]I mean, of course, I turn my stream on and there's an election going on.
[03:11.50]Like, can't you wait for me and my stream?
[03:13.48]Like, it's much more important than the presidential election.
[03:15.65]God, I turn my stream on and there's an election.
[03:19.25]That just sounded so, like, spoiled.
[03:24.68]But yes, if you're not from the United States, you're probably going to be seeing a lot of random political talk in the chat.
[03:33.20]Chat.
[03:35.09]Oh, I didn't even say that I was streaming.
[03:36.49]Let me tell Twitter that I'm streaming.

[06:14.72]I don't know why.
[06:18.38]The election is going to wrap while I'm streaming.
[06:23.55]I don't know when, but I know it's going to happen.
[06:27.33]This is going to turn into a Trump impression stream.

[07:15.61]Okay.
[07:16.75]I think we can switch over to the game now.
[07:19.94]If Donald Trump asked me anything.
[07:25.66]Let's move over to this.
[07:28.14]Which should bring us to game capture of... Man, my computer's running like shit.
[07:37.00]Hopefully it's not like this in the game.
[07:38.06]Otherwise I'm going to have to turn down some settings.
[07:41.42]But there's the game.
[07:42.04]And let's see how it plays out.
[07:45.92]Hopefully it works.
[07:48.74]And... Hey, there we go.
[07:51.22]I can actually move.
[07:52.54]Oh, no, I can't.
[07:55.50]Now I can.
[07:56.92]Alright.
[07:58.90]So, I don't know anything about this particular video game, except that it's Hitman.
[08:02.80]And I love Hitman, so... Gameplay, anything, opportunities, instinct, I don't even know what any of this shit means.
[08:10.13]I've not even done the tutorial.
[08:13.31]So, whatever.
[08:14.17]We'll figure this out later.
[08:16.25]Opening cutscene.
[08:17.13]Shut up.
[08:21.83]Opening cutscene, shut up!
[08:30.43]Alright.
[08:32.27]You can talk again.
[08:34.27]Opening cutscene is over.
[08:40.40]Alright, where's my mini-map?
[08:48.18]What is that?
[08:50.47]This might be a little too loud.
[08:52.29]Alright, Deborah, shh, shut up.
[08:55.78]Cutscene.
[09:00.31]Majestic, isn't it?
[09:02.77]I'm Diana.
[09:03.87]I'll take you to your quarters.
[09:06.14]Someone likes to keep secrets.
[09:07.54]Shut up!
[09:08.26]Secrets are our stock and trade.
[09:10.38]Besides, from what I hear, you have a few of your own.
[09:13.06]I'm not like you, in case you're wondering.
[09:15.52]I'm in the handler program.
[09:17.39]Agents and handlers work in unity.
[09:20.05]You know the expression.
[09:21.79]Shut up!
[09:22.17]These people are talking.
[09:23.83]There's a cinematic going on in the game.
[09:25.75]People, these two in the game.
[09:26.85]Shut up!
[09:28.19]I know.
[09:29.03]You also... I read your case file.
[09:30.95]Impressive work.
[09:32.31]Partly textbook, but I suppose field work never is.
[09:35.08]Impressive work.
[09:36.41]Partly textbook, but I suppose fieldwork never is.
[09:39.81]Tell me, what did it feel like, taking lives?
[09:44.58]Random.
[09:45.84]Disordered.
[09:47.64]Is that why you came here?
[09:49.28]Why you let us test you?
[09:51.68]Maybe I'm not the only one being tested.
[09:55.70]Well, we are here.
[09:57.74]Basic training starts at 0600 hours.
[10:00.80]I should leave you to prepare.
[10:07.78]Do it.
[10:09.50]Ah, no, not yet.
[10:10.42]Shut up.
[10:11.06]Are you sure about this?
[10:12.70]I am.
[10:13.28]There are no second chances, Miss Burnwood.
[10:15.54]Not here.
[10:16.44]I choose him.
[10:17.80]May I inquire why?
[10:18.26]Sound is not in sync.
[10:19.14]Are you serious?
[10:20.12]I'm quite slate.
[10:20.77]Antisocial.
[10:22.03]Apathetic and unresponsive.
[10:23.31]It should be.
[10:23.79]No doubt the boy shows promise.
[10:25.25]Shut, wait, shut up!
[10:26.05]Perhaps I see a possibility where others see limitation.
[10:28.89]Isn't that what a handler does, sir?
[10:30.95]We'll see.
[10:32.19]Anyone can kill, Miss Burnwood.
[10:35.04]He still remembers nothing?
[10:36.42]If he does, he's not sharing.
[10:38.51]We will check up on his story.
[10:40.77]The hospital in Romania.
[10:42.51]In the meantime, keep him under close watch.
[10:54.55]Welcome to advanced training.
[10:56.36]Oh, no.
[10:56.66]Your first mission originally took place in Sydney, Australia.
[10:59.64]Okay, cool.
[11:00.34]The target was Calvin Ritter, also known as the Sparrow.
[11:04.28]Oh, the Sparrow.
[11:04.92]Master thief for hire, specializing in rare and priceless art.
[11:09.14]Our agent cleverly infiltrated Ritter's private yacht during a social gathering and discreetly eliminated him without any of the guests noticing.
[11:17.64]Now you will do the same.
[11:19.61]Oh, and don't worry about the training operatives.
[11:21.68]All weapons are simulated.
[11:23.70]Good luck, Initiate.
[11:24.42]Oh, so this is just a simulation.
[11:27.54]Alright, so I need to know if it's out of sync.
[11:31.58]How do I take out a gun?
[11:32.93]I need to shoot the air to make sure you guys know.
[11:38.41]Is this in sync?
[11:40.01]Where do you think you're going?
[11:41.03]You're not coming through here.
[11:41.91]Okay, you're not allowed to board in your current outfit.
[11:45.38]Yeah, you need to infiltrate the cargo area.
[11:48.51]Alright, tell me if this is out of sync.
[11:50.71]Is me choking the s- Alright, me snapping that guy's neck.
[11:55.61]Is that in sync?
[11:56.79]Was that in sync?
[11:57.39]Okay, good.
[11:57.59]There's so many resubs coming in.
[12:13.50]Alright, it's in sync.
[12:16.02]Alright, good.
[12:25.25]Yeah, I'll have to check the resubs after this mission, because I can't alt-tab.
[12:29.65]I can't go up there, sure.
[12:33.01]Infiltrate the cargo area.
[12:34.09]Alright, get in the car and just drive into the boat.
[12:36.69]Just drive up the boat.
[12:41.48]I will have to... Very... Okay, easily enough.
[12:44.10]I got it.
[12:45.24]I just have to go sneak up behind this guy and just steal his clothes.
[12:49.16]This is the easiest game I've ever fucking played.
[12:51.74]Clumsy fuck.
[12:52.34]Oh, I'm sorry.
[12:53.34]Yes, I'm very clumsy.
[12:54.34]What the?
[12:55.55]Okay, ladies.
[12:55.89]What?
[12:56.25]What's going on?
[12:56.69]What is going on?
[13:10.81]I don't get it.
[13:12.41]Oh, I have to press D. I get it.
[13:14.01]Alright, got him.
[13:17.57]Let's do it.
[13:25.00]What is happening right now?
[13:28.48]It's just beating the shit out of people.
[13:32.20]What the fuck?
[13:32.83]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[13:34.31]You have to, like, it's a quick time event.
[13:36.03]Alright, I didn't know, I didn't understand.
[13:37.39]Now I understand.
[13:40.89]It is actually out of sync?
[13:44.26]What the fuck?
[13:45.22]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[13:51.60]Give me one second.
[13:53.18]Uh, I'm gonna have to restart the stream, by the way.
[13:57.85]So wait, is it out of sync in which way?
[14:02.69]Is it, what's happening first?
[14:06.04]So, let's put it this way.
[14:07.16]When I punch this guy in the face, do you hear the noise first, or do you hear the noise later?
[14:12.96]Like, when I punched him right in the balls, did you hear it after it happened?
[14:17.84]Because I'm going to have to restart the stream.
[14:25.39]I need a mod to tell me.
[14:32.41]Video, then audio.
[14:33.35]Okay.
[14:35.10]Give me one second.
[14:36.80]Alright, I'll be right back.
[14:38.96]I have to restart the stream.
[14:39.78]Because I ain't gonna have this happen again.
[14:41.74]I'll be back.
[14:55.79]Still happening?
[14:56.53]I just... I can't figure out what's going on.
[15:03.71]Let's see.
[15:07.84]Because I don't know why this will be happening.
[15:09.88]It's weird.
[15:11.58]Let's try it again.
[15:12.90]Here we go.
[15:14.92]Ready?
[15:15.18]Let's see.
[15:15.48]Do you tell me what happens?
[15:16.60]Because I just tested it and it was perfectly fine on the recordings.
[15:20.99]Alright, here we go.
[15:22.09]Don't do this.
[15:37.56]Is he good?
[15:38.04]It's in sync?
[15:38.98]It is in sync.
[15:40.75]Hey, what do you know?
[15:44.89]So what the hell was that?
[15:45.89]Alright, don't ask me what the hell that was, because I just tried to change like five different settings and it didn't fix it.
[15:53.57]So, I have no idea.
[15:54.65]Alright, good to know.
[15:57.24]It's in sync.
[16:02.26]In sync.
[16:04.28]That's what I like to hear.
[16:08.45]Alright, eliminate Calvin.
[16:11.70]It's in sync.
[16:12.46]Good.
[16:13.36]Alright.
[16:14.68]Well, that was kind of annoying.
[16:20.14]Okay, I obviously have to go and steal one of these guys' clothes.
[16:26.52]Is there anything I can do over here?
[16:27.50]No.
[16:27.92]There's my insight.
[16:32.59]I can look through walls.
[16:33.51]Cool.
[16:36.86]What?
[16:38.06]What?
[16:38.60]What's going on?
[16:43.02]What's going on?
[16:43.95]Uh, nothing.
[16:45.01]Oh, pro- Okay, I have to like do it piece by piece.
[16:50.77]Alright, fine.
[16:51.49]We'll do it piece by piece.
[16:54.65]Hey, what's going on?
[16:57.97]Yeah.
[17:00.90]No, here we go.
[17:01.86]Oh, okay.
[17:02.52]You're not allowed on board in your current outfit.
[17:06.46]Yeah, understood.
[17:08.48]So it wants me to do what?
[17:10.24]Go this way?
[17:11.04]Okay.
[17:14.09]Sorry about all that.
[17:18.25]We should be good to go now.
[17:30.49]Alright, this is the first space to take cover.
[17:33.17]Okay.
[17:34.33]Subdue the mechanic.
[17:37.11]That's the easiest thing you've... Okay, I know it's Q. I did that before.
[17:49.58]Subdue.
[17:49.86]Alright, now take his clothes, get on the boat, and shoot that guy.
[17:54.90]But first, let me just make sure he's really fucking dead.
[17:56.78]I snapped his neck?! !
[18:00.02]I just, like, grazed his beard with my fingers.
[18:05.16]Non-target kill.
[18:06.04]Please don't tell me I have to... Let's dump him.
[18:08.62]How do I not crouch?
[18:10.38]There it is.
[18:10.90]See.
[18:11.00]Conceal the body.
[18:11.70]Did I not do that?
[18:12.54]I guess not.
[18:13.20]I guess I didn't conceal the body very well.
[18:32.42]Bring him into the bathroom.
[18:38.97]It's just a simulation.
[18:43.25]Where's the bathroom?
[18:49.66]Is it in this tiny little room?
[18:54.36]Oh, there it is.
[18:57.19]Alright, come on in.
[18:57.91]Dump him in the toilet.
[19:05.12]close door freeze close the fucking door what close the door close the fucking door the door won't close don't move a muscle oh god damn it where I can see him get quick timed close the fucking door oh my goodness fucking gracious what he gets up I thought I like beat the shit out of him alright the door is closed
[19:32.76]Oh my fucking goodness gracious, will you stay down?
[19:37.42]Seriously, I need to like fucking strangle this guy.
[19:39.82]Oh my fucking god.
[19:43.77]I am just so irritated right now.
[19:49.13]Where is he?
[19:54.75]Good job.
[20:00.87]Give a shit.
[20:03.54]Who's talking?
[20:05.60]Is this the guy that I just shot in the face?
[20:13.24]Here comes everybody.
[20:14.14]Uh, should I climb?
[20:21.52]Failing the tutorial.
[20:23.52]Well, dude, it's telling me to bring the guy in the bathroom, and then I couldn't close the door.
[20:27.31]Apparently he was in the fucking way.
[20:30.92]I'm just so anxious to, like, actually play the game.
[20:34.96]Oh my god, I have to do this again.
[20:37.40]Simulated dying.
[20:38.54]Oh, you can't go this way.
[20:43.99]Turn around, please.
[20:44.67]Go put a guy in a bathroom.
[20:46.05]Oh, wait.
[20:46.65]He gets stuck in the door, though.
[20:47.75]Be careful about that.
[20:48.67]He'll get stuck in the fucking door.
[20:49.85]There.
[20:55.38]There's only one... Okay, explain this to me.
[20:57.94]There's no police anywhere around here.
[21:01.02]Why did they come in here?
[21:02.82]What was the point of them coming in here?
[21:04.94]Nobody comes in here.
[21:06.32]Why were there cops here?
[21:07.16]Give me his clothes, drag him into the fucking bathroom.
[21:13.76]I did.
[21:16.90]They saw you?
[21:17.44]From where?
[21:18.81]They saw me through the window?
[21:33.68]There's nobody on my mini-map right now.
[21:39.80]Okay, get in here.
[21:42.08]And stay in here.
[21:45.48]It closes automatically.
[21:46.60]That's fantastic to know.
[21:51.35]Just dunk his head in the toilet.
[21:52.63]Alright, let's get on the yacht.
[21:56.35]Wait, save the game.
[21:58.69]Save game.
[22:00.29]Just in case we fail the tutorial for like a fifth time.
[22:04.67]Watch this one.
[22:06.31]Oh, no, I can't do that, never mind.
[22:09.61]I can't sprint.
[22:12.33]They can see through windows, guys.
[22:14.31]People marked as threats will find you suspicious.
[22:15.99]Make sure they do not see you.
[22:18.25]Thanks for telling me that as I walk into the room.
[22:26.07]Hey, do you guys know that new recruit?
[22:28.27]Hey, he's kind of a fucking weirdo.
[22:30.67]Shh, don't talk now.
[22:31.58]He's hiding behind the Hyundai.
[22:40.39]Hey, wrench monkey.
[22:43.09]Hey.
[22:43.53]Hey.
[22:47.33]There he is.
[22:47.71]Yeah.
[22:50.03]Dragonfire.
[22:54.71]Oh, easy.
[22:56.63]Pick up the fucking ice spray.
[22:57.47]Somebody with a stupid extinguisher.
[22:59.75]Oh.
[23:00.67]Didn't know somebody was in there.
[23:02.53]Sorry.
[23:08.19]Hey, would you mind a little privacy, please?
[23:19.43]How do I put this down?
[23:24.99]How do I put it down?
[23:25.97]Okay.
[23:30.19]Snap his neck.
[23:31.11]Make sure he doesn't get up again.
[23:34.47]Put him in the recycling bin.
[23:39.19]I have no idea.
[23:39.75]No, just leave.
[23:41.13]Okay, someone else is going to come in the bathroom.
[23:43.93]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:44.63]We're going to have to stake the bathroom out for a second here, guys.
[23:49.31]Unfortunately.
[23:51.37]How does it open?
[23:52.07]Okay, I'm going to have to wait for somebody else to come in the bathroom.
[23:57.36]We have to wait for like the three NPCs that use the bathroom on this level and kill all of them.
[24:01.50]Because you know the AI is programmed to have the same like Five Guys go to the bathroom.
[24:12.43]I don't see anybody in the map coming down here.
[24:13.73]Wait, what about this guy on top left?
[24:16.11]He's definitely coming in here to take a piss.
[24:20.02]Nope.
[24:22.50]Okay.
[24:24.92]I think we're good.
[24:26.20]Yeah, we're good.
[24:29.23]That was so loud.
[24:30.35]I did not expect it to be that loud.
[24:32.81]Nobody go to the bathroom!
[24:35.33]Where is he?
[24:36.23]Down there?
[24:37.21]Easy.
[24:39.19]Uh...
[24:41.87]Trigger the fire alarm.
[24:45.22]Hold instinct down.
[24:45.94]Where's he?
[24:48.42]There he is.
[24:51.04]Where's the fire alarm?
[24:54.44]Where's the fire alarm?
[24:57.32]I just pulled the fire alarm and nothing happened.
[25:00.78]Wow, what a shitty building.
[25:02.22]A broken fire alarm.
[25:03.23]Are you serious?
[25:09.91]What is going on?
[25:12.83]Everybody's screaming and there's no fire alarm!
[25:22.38]No, I don't wanna poison the wine.
[25:28.60]This doesn't look like a very scared crowd.
[25:30.44]Oh my god, can you guys hear that fake fire alarm?!
[25:37.82]It's insane!
[25:40.62]Oh my goodness!
[25:42.20]It's horrible!
[25:46.96]Where is he?
[25:48.40]Did they take him to like the old back room or something?
[25:50.08]He's over there.
[25:53.14]Okay, time to finish this mission.
[25:58.77]He's right there.
[25:59.31]I'm going to throw him over the fucking side.
[26:01.07]Mister, you are trespassing.
[26:02.53]Stay put.
[26:03.96]You stay right there!
[26:06.12]Not another step!
[26:08.08]Alright, you're free to go about your business.
[26:10.12]Alright, you're free to go.
[26:10.92]Alright, you're free to go.
[26:12.48]And that's the guy.
[26:15.10]Stay right there.
[26:15.72]Don't move a muscle.
[26:16.44]You're free to go, sir.
[26:17.20]Thank you for, uh, understanding.
[26:23.09]Come on, like, look out a window.
[26:24.15]Asshole first class.
[26:28.23]Get out of the fucking way.
[26:30.43]That is your target.
[26:32.13]Calvin Ritty.
[26:34.44]Hey.
[26:35.04]Hey, Calvin.
[26:36.84]How are you?
[26:39.60]Can I talk to you, Calvin, for a second?
[26:42.33]Are you drinking that wine?
[26:44.75]Are you drinking that wine?
[26:45.85]Oh, fuck.
[26:47.37]I can't poison.
[26:49.25]Break his neck!
[26:51.43]I did it.
[27:11.81]Let's do it again.
[27:12.51]Oh, I love this game already Oh, I don't notice you you're not one of those guys.
[27:19.33]It's supposed to be here Don't my desk we're just the painting NPCs give me a fucking hammer Oh my god, they're sure to fucking break all your necks.
[27:36.30]Oh What's that one break
[27:38.23]Snap your neck, excuse me, snap his neck, excuse me, one, two, three, all three necks broken.
[27:42.13]Thank you very much, thanks for coming.
[27:43.73]Alright, I'm gonna kill him instantly.
[27:56.58]Okay, fire alarm.
[27:58.08]Trigger the fire alarm.
[28:04.26]Motherfuck.
[28:05.58]Does this thing work?
[28:06.28]Turn off the lights.
[28:10.84]No lights.
[28:12.16]Lights don't work either.
[28:12.96]Open this.
[28:13.56]Engine room.
[28:14.60]Sabotage the engine.
[28:18.78]No, I'm getting way too off track here.
[28:24.93]Where'd he go?
[28:28.29]It's not real.
[28:32.45]I'm having too much fun just being like a dickhead.
[28:34.55]It's fun.
[28:36.84]Oh, there's a wrench.
[28:37.30]Are you kidding me?
[28:37.72]Give me the wrench.
[28:38.16]Give me the wrench.
[28:40.03]Put this down.
[28:40.49]I don't even care.
[28:40.85]Give me the wrench.
[28:41.25]Where's the wrench?
[28:41.81]Where's the fucking... How do I get the wrench?
[28:44.71]No, I didn't.
[28:45.39]He's still alive.
[28:45.98]You're both still alive.
[29:20.50]Bastard.
[29:22.07]You sick bastard.
[29:23.07]You took somebody's life.
[29:28.51]Alright, I gotta stop fucking around.
[29:30.09]I can't do this anymore like this.
[29:34.58]I need to just find the guy and get rid of him.
[29:38.56]I can't play open simulated kind of games like this.
[29:41.52]I can't do it.
[29:42.11]I just do stupid shit every time.
[29:43.43]It's too much fun.
[29:48.76]Where is he standing?
[29:49.28]Can I throw this at his head from up here?
[29:51.18]Like he's standing somewhere over here, right?
[29:54.28]There he is.
[29:54.64]Hold on.
[30:02.99]Hold on.
[30:05.79]Let me see if it would reach.
[30:07.95]Will it reach if I throw it from here?
[30:12.09]No.
[30:13.10]Not really.
[30:15.54]Okay, that was just annoying.
[30:16.70]I didn't do anything.
[30:19.09]Whatever.
[30:25.78]Body found.
[30:26.44]Uh-oh.
[30:27.42]Alright, I gotta get back up.
[30:29.02]There's a guy right here.
[30:29.78]Can I tie him up with rope or something?
[30:37.55]Stuff him in the magician box?
[30:43.97]Where'd he go?
[30:44.82]He's still up on that deck.
[30:51.02]What the hell is that guy doing?
[30:54.64]Alright, deck zero.
[30:55.64]Okay, that's where I was.
[30:56.70]Okay, they know at this point.
[31:00.90]What was that?
[31:02.78]Rat poison?
[31:04.84]Cool.
[31:05.82]This guy's trying to cut me off this way.
[31:07.62]Look at this guy.
[31:08.18]Wait, what?
[31:11.45]Can I make him eat rat poison?
[31:13.45]I don't like your... What the hell are you doing?
[31:20.18]Who said that?
[31:21.28]Stuff rat poison down his throat.
[31:22.68]Is there a person in the car?
[31:25.74]Okay, we're going alright so far.
[31:29.17]Where is he?
[31:29.79]Where'd he go?
[31:30.65]He's up that way?
[31:34.87]Over there?
[31:35.55]Where the fuck is he?
[31:51.22]Alright, I promise I'm gonna do it right next time.
[31:53.38]I'm just having too much fun.
[31:58.31]Where did he go?
[31:58.87]Did he, like, escape?
[32:02.83]Did you guys see him anywhere?
[32:07.01]Does he actually, like, leave if you don't do it right?
[32:09.37]Wait, he's dead?
[32:15.14]How did he die?
[32:19.22]Oh, no, no, I didn't want to do that.
[32:19.98]I didn't want to do that.
[32:20.82]Alright, I'll do it for real this time.
[32:21.90]No more fucking around.
[32:23.76]I'll actually complete the level.
[32:25.12]Let's go.
[32:25.54]I love doing this, though.
[32:28.28]I love, like, just killing random people and electrocuting people.
[32:32.07]I didn't even electrocute anybody.
[32:33.37]Understood.
[32:34.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:37.75]Hi, guys.
[32:39.11]I'm going to do the mission for real this time.
[32:45.58]There he is.
[32:48.84]There's a thing of interest over here, right?
[32:58.28]Very detailed.
[32:58.96]Extremely detailed levels.
[33:03.16]What is this alligator floating?
[33:04.32]That's cool.
[33:09.66]He's going to follow him.
[33:11.14]Okay.
[33:12.46]Follow the target.
[33:16.36]No pulling fake fire alarms.
[33:17.88]No throwing extinguishers at random people.
[33:24.76]I'll wait until he goes to the bathroom and then I'll karate chop his neck.
[33:27.48]There he is.
[33:28.70]Oh, he's going upstairs.
[33:30.76]Alright.
[33:31.00]Save it.
[33:41.35]Love the vest.
[33:45.51]That is your target.
[33:47.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:49.07]Oh, Mr. Red, I'm such a huge fan.
[33:52.79]I believe you have duties to perform elsewhere.
[33:55.07]Oh, you're such a visionary artist.
[33:57.02]See, if I had the extinguisher, I could throw it at him right now.
[34:05.80]That'd be great.
[34:09.62]Mr. Mechanic?
[34:11.38]Alright, so he's up there.
[34:12.54]He goes up there.
[34:13.06]Okay, poison his drink.
[34:14.17]Where's the rat poison?
[34:19.11]Let me look at the mini-map here.
[34:21.57]Isn't it like over here?
[34:22.67]No.
[34:22.97]Fuck, that's the same guy.
[34:23.97]I told you, there's three NPCs that go to the bathroom.
[34:25.71]He's one of them.
[34:27.83]Yacht crew member.
[34:28.75]Okay.
[34:32.24]Yacht crew member.
[34:35.03]Is that a yacht crew member down there?
[34:39.63]That's a yacht crew member for sure.
[34:40.99]Alright, I'm going to drag him down here.
[34:43.35]Where's like the whistle button?
[34:48.24]Can I go like... Come on, like walk over here.
[34:59.71]Get over here.
[35:00.31]Come on.
[35:03.02]Any more yacht crew members?
[35:04.78]Besides this guy.
[35:10.04]Wait, let's try this.
[35:10.70]I'm gonna save it right here.
[35:12.45]I just kinda... Even if I get noticed, I'll load it immediately.
[35:15.45]I just wanna know if I can do this without these people down there seeing.
[35:17.51]No, crime noticed.
[35:23.71]By who?
[35:24.57]Oh, the entire room of people.
[35:25.85]Alright, got it.
[35:26.81]It's okay.
[35:27.41]They're not gonna do shit.
[35:33.46]I'm being hunted.
[35:35.94]This way.
[35:41.22]Naked guy.
[35:42.06]Where can I put him?
[35:48.81]Jesus Christ!
[35:50.21]Did you see this body down here?
[35:52.43]It's fucked.
[35:56.47]Hey man, did you have anything to do with this?
[35:58.33]No, of course not, stupid.
[36:04.87]Get in the bathroom.
[36:10.23]Get in the bathroom.
[36:10.73]Hide.
[36:10.97]Oh, shit.
[36:13.17]I think this is the women's bathroom.
[36:15.45]This is infinitely more terrible.
[36:19.18]Yeah, we got a suspect hiding in the fucking women's bathroom.
[36:25.40]Alright, I'll be fine.
[36:26.04]He's gonna not search anymore.
[36:27.06]He'll be an idiot.
[36:31.30]So I'm missing like a ton of subs and bits, by the way.
[36:33.89]I'm sorry, guys.
[36:34.99]I love you all.
[36:39.07]I just wanted to get the stream going before... Okay, I'm good.
[36:41.96]Infiltrate his private deck.
[36:43.10]Okay.
[36:43.24]Unlike mechanics, the cabin crew is allowed upstairs access.
[36:47.58]I see what you're getting at.
[36:49.26]Very unorthodox.
[36:51.04]I like it.
[36:52.06]Very unorthodox.
[36:53.26]You are right.
[36:54.70]I think I'm good.
[36:56.08]Where is he?
[36:56.56]Over that way.
[36:57.14]Gotta go up those stairs.
[36:58.48]Just avoid that one guy.
[37:01.99]I just hit her in the face with the door accidentally.
[37:06.01]Alright, private deck.
[37:08.68]God, I'm not even touching you people, shut up!
[37:15.89]Search is called off, I'm good to go.
[37:18.45]Just don't do- save it.
[37:19.61]Don't do anything stupid.
[37:29.66]Hello sir, I'm going up to the top.
[37:31.58]Thank you.
[37:35.00]The private deck.
[37:36.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:36.98]Oh, please give me the statue of Benjamin Franklin.
[37:38.90]I'm so sorry.
[37:39.34]I have to.
[37:40.22]Yeah.
[37:56.29]That's there for a reason.
[37:57.49]They don't let you just sit there and look at that, you know?
[38:01.79]Like why would they have you be able to do that?
[38:24.78]Oh shit, he's a madman.
[38:34.83]Oh yeah, it's from Boston.
[38:36.21]I shoved it in his face.
[38:37.37]That was terrible.
[38:37.77]Huh.
[38:37.85]Yeah, that's too bad.
[38:38.63]Oh yeah, Stoyvonson.
[38:39.23]Did I have this?
[38:39.81]Huh.
[38:58.63]One man's loss, another man's gain.
[39:01.29]Okay, they don't care that I just took that.
[39:03.84]That precious artifact.
[39:05.08]I would not have been able to do that.
[39:07.74]Quick, vault over.
[39:08.40]Vault over.
[39:20.73]Holy shit, man.
[39:21.69]That was a hard throw.
[39:23.91]That can't be how it happened.
[39:27.92]Ooh, nice job.
[39:31.00]Excellent work.
[39:33.44]I found the secret.
[39:34.16]You just have to walk around in a circle around them and they won't do anything.
[39:39.13]Where did he go?
[39:43.21]I'll fucking do it every time, buddy.
[39:47.39]Oh shit, now you got friends.
[39:51.65]Don't do something stupid.
[39:52.93]I know.
[39:53.97]It's so hard not to, though.
[39:55.33]I'm just gonna take it.
[39:58.29]Fuck it.
[39:58.61]Who cares?
[39:59.29]I'll do it to the guy I'm supposed to get.
[40:01.27]Like this guy.
[40:03.16]Alright, locate the target.
[40:12.34]Ooh, hold on.
[40:13.22]Wasn't far enough.
[40:14.54]Wasn't far enough.
[40:15.22]Shit.
[40:15.36]What?
[40:15.48]Fuck you.
[40:42.40]You are not normal.
[40:46.14]Yeah, yeah.
[40:47.56]I stole it from Louis Vuitton.
[40:49.44]Whatever you said.
[40:50.06]Who cares?
[40:50.42]He's out that way.
[40:51.30]Okay.
[40:51.56]I'm going to get this.
[40:52.56]You guys don't think I'm going to get this ship?
[40:54.48]There's no way I'm not going to get this.
[40:57.44]I didn't lie, Callista.
[41:09.28]Look, you don't have to retire just because... A toast to the future.
[41:15.83]You're recruiting.
[41:17.63]No, not close enough.
[41:20.39]This used to be a night... Yeah, he knows his crew.
[41:25.83]You're not a superhero, Calvin.
[41:28.53]They don't exist.
[41:30.28]Not with that attitude, they don't.
[41:32.60]That man is possessed by the devil.
[41:34.88]What?
[41:36.04]What?
[41:41.58]He almost went over the top.
[41:51.09]Hold on, if he can go over the top, then this has to happen.
[41:56.39]Dude, he's gonna go over the goddamn top, really.
[42:00.03]It's gonna be amazing.
[42:01.65]I gotta save it.
[42:02.27]I have to get this.
[42:04.56]Save it right here.
[42:07.94]This guy's going over the top.
[42:09.73]Shit!
[42:10.03]How come he did that last time?
[42:12.63]I got a better idea.
[42:13.83]Better idea.
[42:33.74]Okay, let's put this away.
[42:35.34]Fuck that precious artifact.
[42:36.50]Go!
[42:36.56]Shit.
[42:59.74]I can get this.
[43:00.48]I need just a clear beeline.
[43:03.00]Not that way.
[43:03.70]I gotta go straight down here.
[43:04.80]I can't.
[43:05.10]I fucking...
[43:27.17]Where's my gun?
[43:27.99]God damn it.
[43:31.39]Alright.
[43:31.81]Okay.
[43:32.47]I'm going to do it right.
[43:34.49]I'm going to do it right.
[43:39.63]Yeah, okay.
[43:40.29]I gotta like pretend to be a bartender.
[43:41.97]Good.
[43:42.25]Ayers.
[43:43.35]Oh, look at this little girl.
[43:44.67]Just blend in.
[43:45.45]Would you like a drink, sir?
[43:46.89]Hey, get out of here.
[43:47.49]Two of you guys get out of here.
[43:48.99]Hmm.
[44:05.36]You're not a superhero, Calvin.
[44:07.74]They don't exist.
[44:09.14]Well, not with that attitude, they don't.
[44:11.43]Okay, what's the difference between me standing there like this or standing there like this?
[44:15.43]Mr. Norfolk, so good of you to fly down.
[44:17.97]Oh, wait a minute.
[44:18.69]Hold on a second.
[44:19.77]Hey, wait a minute.
[44:20.65]He didn't cross his arms.
[44:21.91]Unbelievable.
[44:22.67]Anybody know him?
[44:23.47]Does anybody know this guy?
[44:24.39]He didn't have his arms crossed.
[44:26.05]Come on.
[44:26.55]That's it, man.
[44:28.03]Fucking people out?
[44:30.91]What the hell?
[44:31.71]Do it.
[44:32.57]Do it.
[44:37.31]Fuck!
[44:46.46]Fucking stupid.
[44:48.72]I know, yeah, get rid of the precious artifact, sure.
[44:51.46]Fucking broke on the ceiling.
[44:53.06]Wait, no, you don't know, it's me.
[44:53.86]Hey, hmm.
[44:57.32]Yeah, this is... I know, I can't believe it.
[45:01.29]Making us look bad, yeah.
[45:02.81]Did you just throw that statue?
[45:05.55]Good thing your arms are crossed.
[45:14.78]Fine, just go.
[45:17.59]Get out of here.
[45:25.23]Did I screw up the whole conversation?
[45:26.53]Is he not gonna leave now?
[45:31.85]I feel like he's just not gonna leave.
[45:42.90]Um... Help!
[45:44.16]I need help!
[45:48.81]Oh my fucking god.
[45:50.11]He like broke the mission.
[45:53.61]He couldn't have that conversation.
[45:59.22]Hey, remember this joke?
[46:01.26]Can I carry this with me?
[46:02.54]Okay.
[46:02.70]Here.
[46:03.12]I so badly want to throw this at him.
[46:04.70]Yeah, yeah.
[46:04.94]Wait and observe the target.
[46:05.66]Just save it here.
[46:06.34]Not allowed to have any fucking fun, apparently.
[46:24.83]Sneak.
[46:25.25]Looks like a Glue Man from the front.
[46:27.35]He kind of does.
[46:40.12]Alright, here we go, follow.
[46:41.20]Mr. Norfolk.
[46:42.56]So good of you to fly down.
[46:44.58]Can I offer you a drink?
[46:45.26]You did it.
[46:45.78]Oh, no, thank you.
[46:47.44]No, not before six.
[46:49.90]My wife is very insistent about that rule.
[46:53.08]Okay.
[46:54.40]My sympathies.
[46:55.88]So, excellent timing.
[46:57.62]I just had the computer set up in my office.
[46:59.82]Please tell me more private information.
[47:02.34]Yes, please.
[47:06.62]Save this.
[47:07.00]I don't want to have to listen to that again.
[47:10.58]Okay.
[47:11.96]Still holding the statue.
[47:13.01]Oh, that's a pretty good opportunity to potentially throw the statue.
[47:16.03]I'm going to get told, no, you can't go in here, sir.
[47:18.53]Maybe I can.
[47:19.11]Mm-hmm.
[47:37.82]Well, one guy there.
[47:40.02]One guy there.
[47:41.66]Interesting.
[47:42.58]Alright, sure.
[47:45.62]Here's the plan.
[47:52.25]Sir, stop that now.
[47:55.13]Sorry.
[47:57.17]Okay, hold on.
[47:57.83]Let's just like save this here.
[48:01.65]Yeah, yeah.
[48:04.39]I missed.
[48:05.91]Sir, this is not a dump.
[48:07.37]Don't throw your litter on the ground.
[48:08.85]I'm sorry.
[48:09.95]I didn't mean to throw my trash over there.
[48:11.67]I'm sorry about that.
[48:12.65]I apologize profusely.
[48:20.66]Trash.
[48:22.20]That is a precious artifact.
[48:24.08]Alright, what do we got?
[48:34.29]Alright, there's a guy right there.
[48:35.61]Okay, I don't want to be seen.
[48:36.35]Where is he?
[48:38.35]You too!
[48:38.67]Alright, I did it.
[49:22.60]Get out, get out!
[49:23.22]No, don't go up, go down!
[49:24.30]Go down!
[49:29.33]Get up!
[49:30.29]No, go, go, go, go, go!
[49:31.93]Hold on, wait, London!
[49:33.55]Oh shit, I can't do it.
[49:34.87]There it is, this is the way to get out.
[49:41.80]Did somebody say I was a sniper?
[49:43.54]Hold on, did somebody say I was a sniper?
[49:48.72]I just don't... I can't, man.
[49:53.88]It's too fun.
[49:54.68]I'm gonna fix that sucker!
[50:10.91]Hey, remember when I did this?
[50:11.75]Part 2!
[50:12.01]Can I steal his clothes?
[50:13.91]No.
[50:14.05]What the hell did you do?
[50:39.54]Hmm, what happened?
[50:41.86]Who did such a thing?
[50:42.80]I don't know.
[50:43.58]Call it in on the radio.
[50:44.34]Home free.
[50:44.89]Oh, get the rat poison.
[50:45.55]No, that's not the right way.
[51:08.17]Or is it out here?
[51:09.33]Yeah, this way.
[51:14.31]I... No witnesses!
[51:18.87]Go!
[51:27.72]Climb the boxes!
[51:28.46]They're right in the perfect place for you to climb.
[51:30.16]Oh my fucking god!
[51:35.51]Why did I fucking do that?
[51:37.75]There was no reason to do that.
[51:43.05]Oh, that's cute.
[51:43.73]Alright, no more fucking... This is the prologue.
[51:46.27]Just do it right.
[51:47.76]Sorry.
[51:48.06]Do it right.
[51:48.74]No more fucking around.
[51:49.70]I can't help myself.
[51:53.58]Easy game.
[51:54.14]Watch this.
[51:54.52]Ready?
[51:55.82]Hey, you... What the hell is that?
[51:59.40]Need some help here.
[52:02.17]More of a revolution.
[52:04.85]50 years.
[52:05.21]Someone passed out or something.
[52:07.25]Tough guy, huh?
[52:08.48]Knocking innocent people out?
[52:10.70]Yeah.
[52:11.24]Shame on you!
[52:13.18]He's gone, he's gone, he's gone.
[52:14.44]Command!
[52:14.90]Save it!
[52:15.42]I can't even save it.
[52:20.85]Command, please acknowledge.
[52:22.89]Hello, I'm trying to report in here.
[52:25.30]Get it together.
[52:26.80]I gotta go that way.
[52:27.62]I have to let go by these people.
[52:29.02]It's okay, they don't care.
[52:29.88]Save it.
[52:30.16]Alright, I'm good.
[52:30.50]Time to go.
[52:30.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[52:59.57]Hello.
[53:00.61]Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
[53:02.01]Here's the exit.
[53:18.58]Alright, let's get out.
[53:19.74]Let's play Hitman.
[53:24.98]Nice.
[53:33.75]Okay, good.
[53:34.73]Cool.
[53:35.95]I just wanted them to know.
[53:46.51]Oh, here they come.
[53:47.25]Wait, can I be knocked out of this?
[53:52.89]No, thank God.
[53:53.53]Do you remember when that happened?
[53:58.95]Yeah, I did all that weird shit.
[54:01.04]How did you know?
[54:02.85]They get to lag at a lot of talent.
[54:05.82]Thank you to all the subs and the people that gave bits.
[54:10.76]I've been missing all of them.
[54:12.42]I was too locked in.
[54:13.22]Now here comes this first one.
[54:14.20]First real mission.
[54:32.65]Perhaps it would be better to just... Give me a chance, sir.
[54:37.07]Give him a chance.
[54:37.65]You did that so wrong.
[54:38.83]I will take full responsibility.
[54:41.24]Very well.
[54:42.42]It was just the prologue.
[54:44.14]I get to get it out of my system in the prologue.
[54:45.80]It's okay.
[54:46.78]It'll be alright.
[54:50.65]Welcome back, Initiate.
[54:51.91]What?
[54:52.38]As an ICA agent, every challenge you face... Hold on, wait a second.
[54:56.32]I have to do it again?
[54:57.62]Complete this exercise again, this time attacking it from a different angle.
[55:01.60]What?
[55:02.22]Vary your strategy.
[55:03.82]Improvise.
[55:04.54]Oh, come on.
[55:07.08]That was... I didn't know that.
[55:16.05]Not for poison... Rat poison.
[55:18.29]Oh, I can do that.
[55:21.30]Distract a guard using a generator.
[55:22.84]Oh, now I get to actually do the mission.
[55:25.92]Okay.
[55:28.08]Oh, well.
[55:33.58]Now they give me an explosive?
[55:34.82]Are you serious?
[55:35.72]What are you thinking?
[55:39.06]Why would you give this to me?
[55:44.37]Hey, you know the mission that you were just supposed to do?
[55:46.67]We're going to make it way harder for you to do now.
[55:52.35]I'm never gonna finish this mission.
[55:53.59]Ever.
[55:54.37]It's never gonna happen.
[55:56.75]There's no way.
[55:57.27]Yeah, what happened?
[55:58.09]Yeah, what did he look like?
[55:58.93]What?
[55:59.73]What is going on?
[56:00.81]I'll clearly just... Okay, alright, fine, fine.
[56:21.15]Okay, don't worry.
[56:21.65]I'm gonna do it.
[56:23.15]Okay, that was fucking crazy.
[56:34.64]Oh my god.
[56:35.88]Did you see what he looked like?
[56:37.26]Yeah, I did.
[56:39.52]I did see what he looked like.
[56:40.64]It was me.
[56:43.06]Lockpick.
[56:44.62]Coins and shit.
[56:45.90]Hold, yeah.
[56:46.66]Oh my god.
[56:53.92]Damn it.
[56:55.80]And they're giving me all kinds of weapons.
[56:59.46]This is not what I wanted.
[57:01.04]I can't be trusted with this.
[57:05.92]Can I hide this thing?
[57:06.96]I got just an assault rifle on my back.
[57:12.48]Why would I even take this?
[57:17.11]No, I can't take this gun.
[57:20.89]What a terrible idea.
[57:27.04]No.
[57:27.54]Put it down.
[57:27.92]How do I throw it?
[57:30.16]Not taking that.
[57:30.83]Alright.
[57:37.59]I'm gonna get on the boat.
[57:38.69]I'm gonna go rat poison him.
[57:40.15]We'll complete it by rat poison.
[57:41.37]Oh yeah?
[57:47.94]Who can even see me right now?
[57:48.90]I want to flick the lights.
[57:49.75]Rat poison is no fun.
[57:51.49]Alright.
[57:51.81]I got to drag him into the locker, right?
[57:54.25]Yeah.
[58:19.45]Have fun in there, Metal Gear Solid style.
[58:23.52]Nobody looks for their jacket anytime soon.
[58:40.53]What the fuck are you talking about?
[58:42.75]I was so far away.
[58:43.61]I was so far away from these guys.
[58:46.51]Fine, I'll stop moving.
[58:51.24]What?
[58:51.70]We're pretty much the same guy.
[58:56.18]Who the hell was I just right here?
[59:11.85]Coughing so many rounds.
[59:15.27]Apparently I gotta go this way.
[59:18.15]So these guys don't look at me.
[59:24.73]Let's get on the boat.
[59:31.45]How do I cycle weapons?
[59:33.25]Didn't tell me how to do that.
[59:36.37]Yeah, security bypassed.
[59:45.30]Where's that rat poison at?
[59:48.08]Wait a minute, this is no longer a simulation.
[59:50.36]Oh, really?
[59:56.59]How do I cycle?
[59:57.17]Tab?
[59:57.55]Tab isn't doing it.
[60:02.37]How do I get my explosives?
[60:13.96]Melee, Q, use item, G. Holster, caps, names, shift.
[60:23.99]I, okay, I.
[60:30.61]There he is.
[60:30.91]Fire alarm.
[60:31.51]Go!
[60:31.65]I thought this wasn't a simulation.
[60:36.03]I thought this wasn't a simulation anymore.
[60:41.32]Got him!
[60:44.24]I didn't get him.
[61:05.04]I didn't get him.
[61:06.40]Oh, well.
[61:10.03]If I tried texting, what are you talking about?
[61:19.13]The man pulled a fire alarm.
[61:20.51]Is this still a simulation?
[61:23.09]Oh, they're both still simulations.
[61:25.10]Oh, come on.
[61:26.04]I don't need the most simulations in my life.
[61:27.84]There is never enough security.
[61:31.15]Alright, let's go poison him.
[61:32.17]Let's get that out of the way.
[61:33.29]Easy enough.
[61:33.77]I go get the rat poison.
[61:34.75]It's down here.
[61:40.88]Can I get a bigger map?
[61:46.62]What was it telling me to do here?
[61:49.36]No.
[61:50.75]I love this job.
[61:51.91]Don't you?
[61:52.61]Yeah.
[61:53.17]You can do cool things like I just did.
[61:54.69]Wasn't that fun?
[61:56.09]I wish Bernie cared about art, but no.
[61:58.72]Bernie likes musicals.
[62:01.82]Anything down here I can do?
[62:05.52]No.
[62:08.74]Where's that rat poison?
[62:09.76]There it is.
[62:11.70]Alright, rat poison.
[62:13.68]Disguise as a crewman to defoy detection of poisoning food or drinks.
[62:17.99]Sure.
[62:20.57]You got it.
[62:25.85]I love this job.
[62:33.11]Alright, back up to the bar.
[62:34.49]I need to become one of those waiters.
[62:42.26]I don't know where a waiter would be right now.
[62:53.92]I need to be a crewman.
[62:57.50]I need to beat this guy.
[62:58.38]What happened to the random guy that was over here?
[63:05.87]Isn't he, like, down this way?
[63:12.85]No, you're just some lady on a phone.
[63:15.14]Whoa!
[63:16.66]Yoink!
[63:26.67]There's one crewman over here.
[63:33.86]I gotta get one of these guys' disguises.
[63:36.90]He was hanging out on, like, areas.
[63:43.02]Come here.
[63:44.72]Yeah, I'm here to keep us safe.
[63:51.83]I'm here to keep us real safe.
[64:02.68]I did not.
[64:05.88]I did not.
[64:07.22]This guy's just asleep.
[64:09.12]He's just asleep.
[64:09.90]Don't worry about him.
[64:13.44]Look, he's needing medical attention.
[64:15.96]That's why I've taken him.
[64:20.06]He's gonna be fine.
[64:21.08]He's gonna be fine.
[64:21.74]Everybody just calm down.
[64:28.68]Fuck you!
[64:33.53]Who even saw that?
[64:36.33]Cold Cocker?
[64:37.03]Yeah, I just strangled him, so what do you say?
[64:45.14]I gotta wait for... Alright.
[64:47.22]If I can drag him immediately... Who even saw that?
[64:56.60]Alright, I'm gonna throw a coin down here.
[64:59.61]Hey, you like coins?
[65:09.63]Go get that coin!
[65:17.34]Didn't you hear that cool drop down there?
[65:27.17]Stop throwing shit, man.
[65:29.19]Grow up.
[65:35.63]Stop throwing shit, man.
[65:42.13]Okay.
[65:43.45]Okay.
[65:46.13]Here he comes.
[65:49.71]Oh, nice.
[65:50.17]A new coin.
[65:53.37]That's fucking bullshit.
[65:55.43]That's bullshit.
[65:56.27]I was not... Oh, come on.
[65:58.31]Who's talking?
[65:59.01]I think he thinks the painter just did that.
[66:01.75]He definitely does.
[66:20.60]I'm so glad that the painter just got yelled at for what I did.
[66:22.90]That's amazing.
[66:27.56]Oh, shit.
[66:32.90]Huh?
[66:33.70]Yeah, okay.
[66:35.46]Give me that coin back.
[67:01.07]Can I stuff him somewhere?
[67:05.13]I can't stuff... Okay, no one's gonna come in here.
[67:06.63]So he'll be fine right here.
[67:12.21]Alright.
[67:13.21]We're good.
[67:15.85]Just... What is going on with his nose?
[67:25.98]I think I might have just broken Pinocchio, the adult male version's nose.
[67:33.33]Okay.
[67:35.87]See?
[67:36.11]He was telling lies.
[67:37.39]That's why I did it.
[67:38.77]He told too many lies.
[67:48.62]That's what you get, Prodokio.
[67:51.94]You won't be lying anytime soon.
[67:58.76]Why is his nose doing that?
[68:00.19]It doesn't make any sense.
[68:01.11]Weapon crates?
[68:04.69]Oh.
[68:06.01]That's a weapon crate.
[68:08.74]Save it.
[68:16.84]Let's pick up the gun, pick up the coin.
[68:18.38]And let's go poison that guy's drink.
[68:25.41]It's gonna be super fun.
[68:29.09]I betcha.
[68:33.41]Not this way.
[68:34.59]Where is it?
[68:35.09]Up top, right?
[68:36.45]Hi.
[68:36.67]No.
[68:38.69]No.
[68:39.03]Ugh.
[68:40.27]No.
[68:40.55]No.
[69:07.50]Just throwing coins at these people.
[69:14.98]I had to do it, you know I had to.
[69:18.66]No!
[69:32.62]Yeah, that's fine.
[69:33.34]I don't have to worry about you guys anymore.
[69:36.04]I haven't drank the poison.
[69:37.13]Alright, he's out here now.
[69:48.70]Can I make it like a mixed drink and put poison in it?
[69:50.78]I'm gonna stand on this side.
[69:52.12]Alright, go back to work.
[69:53.22]See you later.
[69:53.54]Good for you.
[69:54.24]Poison the wine.
[69:54.74]Poison the wine.
[69:55.48]He's gonna drink this and he's gonna get wicked bad diarrhea and it's gonna kill him.
[70:18.23]You told me this Norfolk job would be your last.
[70:20.91]And now I overhear the crew talking about Istanbul and Stockholm.
[70:24.27]What gives, Calvin?
[70:25.35]I didn't lie, Callista.
[70:27.27]Look, you don't have to retire just because you leave the field.
[70:30.33]Most great players simply become managers.
[70:33.23]Just gotta wait now.
[70:33.83]You're recruiting.
[70:35.62]Now you're catching on.
[70:37.50]The sparrow cannot die.
[70:39.92]You're not a superhero, Calvin.
[70:42.30]They don't exist.
[70:44.04]Not with that attitude, they don't.
[70:48.83]Alright, take your drink.
[70:49.73]Yeah.
[70:49.97]Pick up your wine and go.
[70:51.15]Grab that glass of wine.
[70:51.97]Oh, no.
[70:52.81]Can't.
[71:18.06]Someone's gonna drink that and die.
[71:20.74]Shit, why did he not... What?
[71:22.74]He doesn't take the wine.
[71:23.80]Oh my lord.
[71:24.28]Go look at that coin.
[71:49.51]Not before six.
[71:55.35]That's it.
[71:56.41]Seriously, I wasn't up for more excitement today.
[71:59.10]Go and look at what happened out there.
[72:02.52]Some random idiot just picked it up.
[72:05.82]You guys are good.
[72:07.22]You guys are good.
[72:12.74]It's more of a revolution.
[72:16.24]50 years ahead of its time.
[72:17.93]Maybe even...
[72:21.50]God damn it!
[72:22.06]Drink the wine next time!
[72:23.28]So now I need another disguise.
[72:24.24]Why would he drink that wine?
[72:50.35]He's technically not over here yet.
[72:52.23]Does he pick up a glass on his way over here?
[72:53.75]He doesn't.
[72:54.67]He's not going to drink that wine.
[72:56.41]He's already drank his drink, apparently.
[72:58.26]I need to go hide in his office.
[72:59.60]I'm going to use the coin.
[73:00.84]I'm going to throw the coin over there.
[73:02.44]He's going to go look at it.
[73:23.17]The coin went through a space.
[73:24.33]That's great.
[73:26.33]If you hear trouble, fuck.
[73:37.46]There's nothing in here to poison.
[73:41.18]Can I poison the coffee?
[73:44.13]Can I hack his computer and make his computer drink it?
[73:57.79]Uh, hold on.
[73:58.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[74:00.65]Hold on.
[74:01.01]Wait, wait, fuck.
[74:02.45]Important.
[74:14.26]Shit, how am I gonna get out of here?
[74:15.36]Okay, this way.
[74:17.66]We get to the exit and then we detonate.
[74:23.65]We just get the hell out of here.
[74:25.25]Get to the exit.
[74:25.85]Detonate the fucking thing.
[74:28.41]Are they going to the office now?
[74:31.89]No one will ever know.
[74:38.14]Is that his computer?
[74:40.16]Is he at the computer?
[74:40.72]I think so.
[74:44.30]And kaboom.
[74:54.61]Huh?
[75:01.96]He didn't go in the office?
[75:13.35]Okay.
[75:14.77]Okay.
[75:17.59]We're gonna do it again.
[75:26.41]Right there.
[75:30.08]Oh, no, thank you.
[75:32.40]No, not before.
[75:33.82]So wait, when does he come?
[75:34.48]When do they come in here?
[75:38.24]Thank you, Patrick Gallo, for the thousand bits, dude.
[75:40.42]Appreciate it.
[75:41.04]Excellent timing.
[75:43.70]I just had the computer set up in my office.
[75:44.98]I just have the computer set up.
[75:45.64]OK, so when they go into that little square.
[75:48.83]Once he goes in that square is where I take the measure and I explode it.
[75:54.72]You got it.
[75:56.88]That square.
[75:58.10]They're not in that square yet.
[75:59.40]I did it a little too early.
[76:00.42]Go on.
[76:00.98]Get in there.
[76:01.78]What is the holdup?
[76:02.88]Go in that room.
[76:19.82]There they go.
[76:20.34]There they go.
[76:22.05]Just a few more feet.
[76:23.05]Oh, let me show you my computer.
[76:29.45]Did I tell you it was a Dell?
[76:30.81]It's a Dell Inspiron.
[76:34.49]Good night.
[76:36.81]Mm-hmm.
[76:44.38]Challenge completed.
[76:50.40]It's pretty flawless if you ask me.

[76:56.19]No, fucking go!
[76:57.61]Get out!
[77:19.03]Nice simulated explosion.

[80:50.29]Just punch through the wall.
[80:54.35]Just, like, Kool-Aid this guy.
[80:57.41]Hey, what are you doing here?
[80:58.95]Mister, you're coming with me.
[81:01.09]Mister, you're coming... Dispatch, dispatch, for Christ's sake, you there?
[81:05.49]What, are you out of your mind?
[81:07.16]Seriously, what... Just start it over.
[81:08.28]I was too busy not looking.
[81:15.00]The final test is based on a nothing.
[81:18.66]Alright, let's go.
[81:21.55]Press the button, I beat it.
[81:22.33]That'd be funny if you could actually do that.
[81:24.55]Alright, how many coins?
[81:27.63]Anything in the trucks or anything I take?
[81:28.87]Okay, there's something over here.
[81:34.71]It is... It's a hammer.
[81:40.96]Don't give me a hammer, that's such a bad idea.
[81:43.72]Uh, sure.
[81:45.13]Okay.
[81:45.29]So he's gonna get in a jet?
[82:15.17]I can vault over this?
[82:20.89]Okay.
[82:21.75]Easy enough.
[82:22.35]Sure.
[82:22.55]Let's go this way.
[82:27.52]There's way too many people over here.
[82:30.04]There's no way I'm going to get in there.
[82:40.23]What does that mean?
[82:40.99]Get a security guard?
[82:42.61]Right, right, right.
[82:43.15]Should I hammer brothers this guy?
[82:50.34]What's quick save?
[82:51.08]There's got to be a quick save, right?
[83:02.34]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[83:04.77]He's not dead.
[83:05.91]He's still alive.
[83:08.58]Not very many people will survive that.
[83:10.22]I can guarantee you that.
[83:21.70]Dump him.
[83:26.26]What?
[83:28.32]Waypoints.
[83:29.00]I don't understand what that means.
[83:32.86]Alt-F4 to quick save.
[83:34.43]Oh my goodness.
[83:35.23]I almost did it.
[83:38.85]Here's this guy.
[83:42.55]Looks like I can go... Okay, it gives you, like, hints.
[83:45.15]I'm not sure I want those on.
[83:51.09]Challenge him to swindle stones.
[83:55.81]I do have coins.
[83:56.69]These are very useful.
[83:57.39]I'm going to keep these on my belt.
[84:04.94]Turn on the radio.
[84:08.51]Don't let this get to you, man.
[84:10.31]Calm and smile.
[84:11.67]Calm and smile.
[84:16.58]Should I take one of these disguises?
[84:18.86]I think I should.
[84:19.36]I tried to strangle him.
[84:26.10]I didn't, apparently.
[84:31.86]Turn the fucking radio off.
[84:34.88]Shut up.
[84:37.30]I just heard a gasp.
[84:38.85]Great.
[84:40.33]That's fucking fantastic.
[84:52.01]Anybody else?
[84:55.75]Anyone else?
[85:06.46]Where am I going to put these guys?
[85:10.69]There's no... I can't put these guys anywhere.
[85:12.63]I just hope nobody comes in and sees these two dead guys.
[85:15.95]Wait, what if I'm behind here?
[85:17.85]It's probably better.
[85:27.30]It's a chicken noise.
[85:28.34]Yeah, I gotta take his gun.
[85:29.22]I will, don't worry.
[85:29.72]Here's a gun.
[85:38.60]Ooh, that's a nice gun.
[85:43.82]Now I'm a real soldier.
[85:52.70]Yeah, can you turn the lights off?
[85:53.92]I tried to.
[85:54.72]Didn't do it.
[85:55.44]I can't, like, touch it.
[86:00.85]Can I just shoot the lights?
[86:05.89]Put the gun away.
[86:06.69]Save it.
[86:07.37]Let's keep going.
[86:10.63]That's a nice gun you have there.
[86:15.35]Alright.
[86:16.09]This way.
[86:17.57]Jet safety protocol seems to be somewhere over... I have no idea.
[86:21.46]We're just going to keep going this way.
[86:27.49]You should let me in, considering I'm... You...
[86:31.31]Oh, rat poison.

[91:19.52]I had to do it.
[91:20.94]Oh, he must be some kind of psychopath.
[91:48.36]And then the real psycho comes up from behind him and smashes him.
[92:00.41]I really need to find something to do with this jet.
[92:03.61]Can I go upstairs now?
[92:05.83]I'm assuming... Come on, shit.

[92:20.76]Can I get a third wrench?
[92:31.68]So how's it... Can I open like a bigger map?

[92:37.60]Can I not see a bigger map?
[92:44.14]So this is no longer a simulation, right?
[92:45.64]So if I press that button... Okay, hold on.

[106:54.91]I got nothing for this one.
[106:59.19]I got nothing for this one.
[107:01.31]I can't do those sounds.
[107:03.19]I just love music.
[107:12.22]Your actions have changed the world.
[107:16.14]Did he get him?
[107:17.12]He got him.
[107:23.34]Wow.
[107:25.72]Powerful men have fallen by your hand, but by the same token, others have risen.
[107:33.98]Do you realize what kind of world you've been shaping?
[107:38.26]Uh-oh.
[107:38.99]Does the ICA... Does your handler...
[107:47.66]Quick scan that barcode.
[107:51.46]I live in that world.
[107:56.24]That was the first real mission.
[107:58.47]I have seen the consequences.
[108:01.27]I felt the cost.
[108:04.49]That's what defines me.
[108:07.33]So this is the guy that I got to ultimately get rid of forever.
[108:11.74]Sure.
[108:13.75]Get to go on business class.
[108:14.83]It's pretty cool.
[108:16.43]That's usually like $200.
[108:21.54]Mission.
[108:21.94]The showstopper.
[108:25.70]Challenge packs.
[108:29.78]Alright.
[108:32.20]This is pretty cool.
[108:34.77]Destinations.
[108:36.37]Paris.
[108:38.25]Bangkok.
[108:38.73]Colorado.
[108:41.67]Let's just do this.
[108:42.31]We'll do the showstopper.
[108:44.20]Good evening, 47.
[108:45.92]Your destination is the Paris Fashion Show by Sanguine, one of Europe's leading cultural brands.
[108:52.50]Your targets are Sanguine or Viktor Novikov, a former oligarch turned fashion mogul, and his partner, Dalia Margolis, retired supermodel, an iconic power couple on the global fashion scene, and two of the most dangerous people in the world.
[109:08.60]Novikov and Margolis are in fact the ringleaders of Iago, an enigmatic spy ring that deals in the global elite's most valuable secrets.
[109:18.79]Unscrupulous and opportunistic, Iago has caused disastrous security leaks all over the globe.
[109:25.65]When Crimean separatists caused a deadly meltdown at the Odessa nuclear power plant, Iago gave them access to the plant's security network.
[109:34.54]And when the Delgado drug cartel shot down the plane of President Hernandez and his family, Iago provided the classified flight plans.
[109:45.23]Now Novikov and Morgolis have obtained a NOC list of British undercover agents, which they plan to sell at a secret Iago auction during the Sanguine show.
[109:54.60]So our client, MI6, need us to stop the ringleaders before the NOC list ends up in the wrong hands.
[110:03.36]The Sanguine show will be swarming with security, and Viktor Novikov will be the focus of everyone's attention.
[110:09.40]But despite his posturing, he is merely the money man.
[110:12.88]The real target is Dalia Margolis.
[110:15.24]Beautiful and brilliant.
[110:17.10]She is a master manipulator.
[110:18.60]I got it.
[110:20.66]I skipped the cutscene.
[110:21.74]I didn't really... That wasn't my intention.
[110:26.35]I gotta get rid of both these people.
[110:27.81]They're a fashion show.
[110:29.13]Bad people.
[110:29.83]Very bad people.
[110:32.52]I'm going to smuggle some stuff in my ass.
[110:33.90]Let's get a syringe.
[110:42.18]No, no, no.
[110:42.68]I want... Give me the syringe.
[110:46.64]Smuggle in... Explosive.
[110:53.52]Concealed weapon.
[110:54.24]Definitely that one.
[110:55.88]Tuxedo.
[110:57.50]Yeah.
[110:59.94]Objectives.
[111:00.40]Play.
[111:00.90]Play.
[111:03.17]Let's do it.
[111:09.65]Yes, they are the evil ones.
[111:12.35]Thank you see clay for your sub.
[111:14.22]And I think that's it.
[111:15.86]Yeah, that's all I missed.
[111:19.96]Welcome to Paris 47.
[111:22.10]The show is just about to start.
[111:23.60]Is that me up there is the red carpet event of the season.
[111:26.42]Oh, it's definitely not veritable who's who of the global fashion elite.
[111:31.09]Don't take my picture.
[111:31.87]This is cool.
[111:32.33]Hmm.
[111:32.61]Ugh.
[111:55.21]No shit I wanna syringe this guy How do I syringe him?
[111:58.17]I wanted to syringe that guy
[112:26.10]Okay, I'm going to go be on TV.
[112:27.48]This is going to be fun.
[112:35.75]Welcome to Paris, 47.
[112:37.31]Alright, what happens if you just go on TV?
[112:41.97]I'm sure you've seen a thousand people do this, but I don't know what happens, so I'm going to do it.
[112:45.21]Cecile, I'm standing outside Palais de Volepska, hosting the Sanguine Fall Fashion Show.
[112:51.42]This impressive structure is a perfect me- Cut!

[112:59.89]I am coked out of my mind.
[113:25.08]Now let me fucking syringe him.

[113:32.91]Give me the camera.
[113:35.15]Give me the camera.
[113:37.11]It just told me I could pick up the camera.
[113:39.97]Okay.
[113:40.45]Yeah, I can pick up the fucking camera.
[113:41.73]Are you kidding me?
[113:48.24]You're just encouraging this guy.
[113:52.74]Welcome to Paris.
[113:54.97]Here's a question.
[113:55.63]Can I get in the front door?
[113:58.12]What do you guys think?
[114:02.86]No.
[114:03.10]I'm not going to be able to get in the front door on this mission, guaranteed.
[114:17.76]I don't think I'm going to be able to get inside the door.
[114:20.52]There's too many things I can do.
[114:22.76]There's too many places to go.
[114:29.39]Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[114:30.25]Forget it, forget it.
[114:30.75]Yeah, fuck you.
[114:34.79]Hey, thanks a lot, man.

[114:41.78]What's this fountain?
[114:47.72]Loose valve.

[122:33.32]What is it going to be?
[122:34.16]I need to separate him somehow.
[122:34.98]Can I just pretend to cut somebody's hair?
[122:37.12]There's nothing I can take from this area of all the makeup tools?
[123:04.24]I could syringe him, you're right.
[123:07.38]But then he would just die.
[123:12.07]Is that the stage?
[123:12.85]That's the stage.
[123:13.65]I gotta think of how to separate them.
[123:35.64]No.
[123:36.74]Save it before I do this.
[123:37.78]This is stupid.
[123:41.80]What about me?
[123:42.56]Not bad.
[123:48.81]Not bad at all.
[123:54.37]Who's that guy up on the catwalk?
[123:56.77]He's not supposed to be there.
[123:58.01]Oh, but look.
[124:01.70]He looks so sexy in that tee.

[124:30.72]I'm fine.
[124:31.10]Don't worry.
[124:38.30]How do I get him?
[124:39.26]I need a belt.
[124:40.12]Where's his clothes?
[124:40.72]What's a wastebasket?
[124:42.42]I need to go to wardrobe and get him a belt.
[124:46.18]Huh?
[125:05.36]Belt.
[125:06.22]Belt.
[125:06.48]If I was a belt, where would I be?
[125:08.98]Ooh, food.
[125:10.16]No, I don't want to poison this ship.

[131:17.32]Who is smashing everything?
[131:18.76]I keep hearing noises.
[131:22.66]Look, I'm just trying to get a Pepsi.
[131:27.00]Let's get a glass of wine.
[131:29.22]Okay.
[131:31.70]Security, you're not safe here.

[131:42.11]Am I going to be allowed back here?
[131:48.16]I just walked by.
[131:51.74]Alright, let's actually do some investigating.
[131:58.50]There he is.
[132:02.01]What is over here?
[132:02.69]This way.
[132:04.95]I'm going to get out of this area and take some looks around.
[132:07.03]How do I get up there?
[132:17.18]I'm gonna get out of this room completely.
[132:20.27]Ah, look, here's some wardrobe stuff.
[132:24.17]Who is that?
[132:24.61]No.
[132:24.67]Should I get his costume ready?
[132:27.55]Why would there be rat poison in the back of this car?
[132:46.70]Doesn't make any sense.
[132:49.32]Yeah, yeah, bring the clothes and the rat poison out to the front, please.
[133:00.59]Anything else of interest?
[133:02.48]A dumpster.
[133:07.22]And in here?
[133:07.76]Whoa.
[133:12.84]Hmm.
[133:14.08]Looks like a different way to go.
[133:15.22]There's a wrench.
[133:17.90]Well, I got a wrench.
[133:23.49]Let's do this one.
[133:28.57]Can I get a skim milk?
[133:31.21]I don't believe it.
[133:31.99]That's dangerous.
[133:36.62]Let's just tighten this and see what it does.
[133:42.17]What does that even do?
[133:43.93]I don't get it.
[133:44.51]What is this supposed to do?
[133:47.15]Is this just like gas come out?
[133:48.61]That's it?
[133:49.23]I don't get it.
[134:21.80]I could have figured that was gonna happen.
[134:27.06]She went sky high.
[134:31.40]She, like, she team rocketed.
[134:33.64]All it needed was just a little sparkle in the air.
[134:38.86]Holy shit.
[134:42.39]Okay, though.
[134:44.65]Like I said, I could have guessed that was gonna happen.
[134:48.81]Okay, I have a wrench.
[134:49.73]What can I do in here?
[134:52.48]What about the ice cream truck?
[134:53.62]He frisked me five minutes ago.
[134:58.69]Can puncture the gas, too?
[135:15.19]You mean like light?
[135:16.39]I'm assuming you shoot that.
[135:17.39]Oh, here's a new place to go.
[135:18.93]Access denied.
[135:19.37]It's okay.
[135:19.91]I'm in a costume.
[135:21.13]It's like the winery.
[135:22.37]This place is so huge.
[135:45.05]Nobody even down here.
[135:50.78]There's one person hanging out there with like three people just sitting down here.
[135:53.68]There's like a cafeteria down here?
[135:57.86]What the fuck is this? 10%.
[136:12.77]Alright, there's so much to do, I'm so lost at, like, what I should do first.
[136:19.39]Whoa.
[136:20.51]What the hell?
[136:24.04]What's going on here?
[136:24.62]Why is he gonna have to close on?
[136:26.30]Why are you naked?
[136:27.62]Is this guy just changing here?
[136:45.42]Wait, what?
[136:49.42]Does he know I went in here?
[136:50.32]I'm just checking that for mice.
[136:58.79]Huh?
[136:59.69]I need help.
[137:03.61]Help!
[137:04.41]I can't deal with this.
[137:06.39]I am- Ah!
[137:18.34]Fuck it, let's go.
[137:24.22]Where am I now?
[137:26.04]Oh, we're at the party.
[137:27.20]I made it to the party.
[137:29.84]I wonder, what is this guy?
[137:30.79]Can I just walk up the stairs?
[137:36.17]That's the lady I gotta get.
[137:41.01]Can I knock him up here?
[137:43.75]Yeah, I can't go up here as this guy.
[137:48.94]No, let me go please Command this is big dog over there.
[137:57.20]Oh
[138:19.06]Got it.
[138:20.26]Command, I'm here now.
[138:29.13]Opportunity updated.
[138:30.27]Sir, I need help.
[138:34.39]I think it's best if you vacate the premises now.
[138:40.59]Axe.
[138:42.67]Ooh, there's the axe.
[138:44.27]Wait, talk to me.
[138:49.18]Alright.
[138:49.54]I'm going to actually play the mission now.
[138:51.29]We had our fun.
[138:54.09]Time to play.
[138:54.93]I will figure this out now for real.
[138:58.81]Honestly, at this point, every murder is self-defense.
[139:06.24]Alright.
[139:07.50]Let's take a look.
[139:08.24]Where do I need to go?
[139:08.88]Intel.
[139:15.24]Opportunities.
[139:17.42]It's this Kruger guy.
[139:18.32]Alright.
[139:18.56]Alright.
[139:20.73]Yeah, so I have to become that guy.
[139:31.85]The question is how did I just get there?
[139:43.78]Okay, like, holy fucking shit game.
[139:47.36]Can I please have... How do I get to the map without having to click five times?
[139:50.92]Alright, droop to sky, drop to skies.
[140:04.01]She's up top.
[140:08.83]Level's zero.
[140:13.65]Oh my god, where did we get this many people?
[140:19.30]Why did I just jump up like 2,000 viewers?
[140:23.24]What just happened?
[140:29.84]Well, hi guys, whoever you came from.
[140:33.77]Oh, hi star.
[140:37.45]Alright, map.
[140:38.75]How do I track this shit?
[140:40.33]Probably should have paid attention to this, shouldn't I have?
[140:48.59]Track, okay.
[140:49.83]This is the one I want to track.
[140:51.13]Track it.
[140:51.73]Alright, let's make our way up.
[140:59.67]Can I open these big Dark Souls doors?
[141:02.86]Oh, Jesus.
[141:04.12]Stinky bad boy, thanks for the bits.
[141:05.56]Thank you, Harbinger, for the sub.
[141:06.64]I missed a bunch of subs.
[141:07.42]Let's open the Dark Souls door.
[141:08.76]What does this mean?
[141:13.64]Break glass.
[141:14.92]No, I don't want to do that.
[141:18.68]So, I was in the bathroom before and I heard these guys talking about an auction or something up on the second floor.
[141:25.12]Let's find out more about Freddy Krueger.
[141:27.92]Alright, I gotta listen to this conversation next to the helijet.
[141:35.06]Wait, what?
[141:43.41]What happens if I get in the way of this picture?
[141:46.73]Hold on.
[141:53.70]Can I talk to him?
[141:57.10]Hide behind the bush.
[142:01.88]I can't kill this guy, obviously.
[142:03.70]That would be a super huge mistake.
[142:04.98]Alright.
[142:09.70]I gotta ask him some questions, right?
[142:15.32]Turn around.
[142:15.68]I need to talk to you.
[142:19.68]Wait a minute, wait, this is the guy I'm gonna be!
[142:20.94]I'm gonna be this guy!
[142:21.94]I'm gonna put the face paint on and be this guy!
[142:25.48]Wow, yeah, please continue to walk dangerously far away from anybody that you know.
[142:29.38]Because in the mad way, they're just gonna fucking syringe you.
[142:34.13]It's gotta be a syringe, by the way.
[142:36.43]Like, you kidding me?
[142:39.13]Put it away, put that away!
[142:40.33]Save.
[142:45.79]Shouldn't have taken me to the, like, Alice in Wonderland maze.
[142:48.17]That was your biggest mistake.
[142:55.59]Oh, no.
[142:56.33]Shit.
[142:58.53]Alright, I look like him.
[143:00.77]It's me.
[143:04.25]Alright, I'll get him this time.
[143:13.14]I'll get him this time.
[143:18.62]Fuck.
[143:24.66]He can't go that far, obviously.
[143:28.84]How am I supposed to find out more about this guy?
[143:30.62]Do I just have to keep following him?
[143:36.95]What is he doing over here?
[143:39.91]He's going to have a cell phone call.
[143:41.17]Oh yeah, by the way, I'm a bad guy.
[143:47.15]Not yet.
[143:47.89]I go on in a few cycles.
[143:51.56]I think...
[143:53.48]I have.
[143:55.04]I think I'm in, but I want to be clear on a few details.
[143:59.22]I'm so close.
[144:00.68]Fine.
[144:01.42]I'll be up after the show.
[144:04.06]Yes, ciao.
[144:07.40]Hey, we're not animals in the zoo throwing our ship.
[144:16.15]That guy had to make a pun, and him making the pun got him killed.
[144:21.76]You could have just shot me, dude.
[144:23.24]You know, you could have just done it.
[144:25.74]You could have just shot me.
[144:30.00]That's alright.
[144:32.50]That was brutal.
[144:33.12]That was horrible.
[144:34.82]Alright, let's go.
[144:36.80]So now I gotta call somebody?
[144:39.72]Where's my phone?
[144:40.90]Where's his phone?
[144:46.02]New intel.
[144:48.24]Let me save it.
[144:55.15]Alright, let's call.
[144:58.23]He doesn't know my voice.
[145:00.23]I'm Mr. Kruger!
[145:31.33]Take a deep breath and tell me what happened.
[145:33.93]Take a deep breath.
[145:34.91]Yeah, what happened to you?
[145:35.79]Why did you just get a knife thrown into your fucking face?
[145:37.93]Let's go get our makeup done.
[145:46.49]It's over there?
[145:47.07]Okay.
[145:48.28]Makeup.
[145:52.44]This music is so loud.
[145:58.09]Alright, close these doors.
[146:00.19]I won't be able to see you through the door.
[146:01.29]Alright, it's time to get our makeup done.
[146:12.53]Makeup, please.
[146:13.03]Ah, yeah, do my makeup.
[146:14.19]Make me look beautiful.
[146:15.01]What is he gonna do?
[146:15.83]Oh, he's gonna put me like the... Okay.
[146:17.37]So now I get to go on the stage.
[146:40.75]Hurry up.
[146:41.11]Just smear it on me like the egg.
[146:43.03]You're taking too long.
[146:47.54]You look like a shitty Joker impression.
[146:54.88]Can I skip this?
[146:59.25]Nice.
[147:00.31]You can do my makeup again.
[147:06.07]You didn't do it right.
[147:06.79]Do it again.
[147:07.13]Do it better this time.
[147:13.50]I wish I could shoot him from the chair.
[147:15.44]Time to walk the catwalk.
[147:17.76]Wait, wait, wait.
[147:19.74]Time to walk the catwalk.
[147:21.52]But first, but first, I need to make sure I bring one of my special items on the catwalk.
[147:27.86]Where is it?
[147:29.75]She's right here.
[147:30.91]He's right there.
[147:31.37]He's right here.
[147:37.01]Where is it?
[147:37.47]Where is my weapon?
[147:38.11]Where's the fucking fire axe?
[147:39.53]I need to bring my special fire axe.
[147:40.93]Beautiful.
[147:47.46]Come on, where is it?
[147:49.22]I don't know what I did with it.
[147:50.46]I need to bring it out on stage to show the humanity of fashion.
[147:53.68]There it is.
[147:54.12]I need to show them.
[147:56.12]You know, it's like life and death.
[148:03.36]Weird.
[148:14.65]I wonder if they're gonna be mad at me for this.
[148:20.74]Walk the catwalk!
[148:26.60]Who has a gun on the stage?
[148:28.60]Who has a gun on the stage?
[148:30.59]Does that guy have a gun?
[148:34.77]That guy had a fucking gun on the stage.
[148:36.21]He just shot me like a hundred times.
[148:39.81]No, fuck that.
[148:40.85]I'm doing it again.
[148:44.61]I just am carrying an axe.
[148:46.67]Is that that big of a deal?
[148:51.25]Honest to God.
[148:53.45]That's such a huge deal apparently.
[148:55.47]I'm carrying an axe.
[148:56.74]Damn, what the fuck?
[149:11.71]I just wanna throw the axe at someone.
[149:19.88]I just wanna, like, whip the axe.
[149:25.50]Hide the axe in the boot.
[149:26.64]Oh, fuck it.
[149:28.29]I'm just going on the stage.
[149:34.67]Yes, cheer for me.
[149:35.77]It's me.
[149:37.69]Alexander the Great.
[149:39.15]Whoever you think I am.
[149:50.25]Get one more good reaction.
[149:57.86]Alright, we did it.
[149:58.88]I walked the catwalk.
[150:00.92]Leave the catwalk.
[150:04.56]Why does it keep making me do this?
[150:10.68]I already did this.
[150:11.50]Do I have to go the whole way?
[150:20.41]I don't think I'm doing this right.
[150:21.83]Alright, hold on.
[150:24.81]Oh, here we go.
[150:28.47]Alright, I can leave now, right?
[150:35.65]Meet up with Margolis.
[150:37.61]He got it.
[150:43.56]Leave the catwalk.
[150:47.18]Alright, where is she?
[150:49.32]She's all the way upstairs.
[150:50.44]Fuck!
[151:17.52]It's too much fun.
[151:19.04]I'm sorry.
[151:19.63]It's too much fun to do this.
[151:23.79]No, shit!
[151:25.89]Oh, that's the guy!
[151:30.23]That's the guy!
[151:30.81]Okay, I got him.
[151:31.49]I got the guy I needed to kill.
[151:34.78]That's the guy.
[151:35.44]I had to eliminate that guy.
[151:46.84]The guy just happened to be in line of guys I had to kill.
[151:52.36]Didn't save.
[151:52.86]Yeah, I did.
[151:53.28]Yeah, I saved it.
[151:59.44]He's right here.
[152:00.22]He just kind of walked over here and got killed.
[152:05.43]Dude, I wonder if I can just fucking kill this guy.
[152:07.29]I was going to hide in the bathroom and just shoot him.
[152:10.37]He comes right this way.
[152:14.95]I think I can get like a stealth kill here.
[152:16.39]I could throw a wrench at a guy.
[152:19.67]Yeah.
[152:20.95]It's gonna be pretty.
[152:21.57]I'm gonna destroy this dude.
[152:23.13]He's right here.
[152:24.57]No one's gonna know.
[152:25.19]Only this girl.
[152:25.67]She's on her phone.
[152:26.25]You're not even paying attention.
[152:27.01]She's on like Twitter.
[152:27.68]We both heard that crap.
[152:29.86]Didn't kill him.
[152:30.46]Fuck.
[152:31.22]He's still alive.
[152:31.64]Target's gone.
[152:49.23]I throw a wrench at a guy's head, doesn't kill him.
[152:51.75]That's great.
[152:54.29]Where do I meet this person?
[152:56.33]What does this do?
[152:59.17]What did I even do?
[153:00.19]I touched a winch.
[153:01.09]Okay.
[153:15.41]Alright, apparently I touched a roll of thread on the wall and I got instantly killed.
[153:26.82]I honestly think I can shoot this guy and run.
[153:29.94]In fact, I guarantee I can.
[153:33.28]This person right there is looking at me, but once she leaves... Wait, we can do one-two.
[153:38.20]I can go bang-bang.
[153:40.47]It's gotta be good.
[153:40.93]I have to have good aim.
[153:43.03]It's all about having good aim because that's one, two, silenced.
[153:46.87]She's taking a selfie.
[153:47.55]Perfect opportunity.
[153:49.17]I know it is a lot.

[154:23.59]Everyone's freaking out.
[154:24.25]It's okay.
[154:24.75]Now's my chance.
[154:25.21]I can just go on the catwalk.
[154:26.25]I'm supposed to be on the catwalk.
[154:32.00]Hey, remember me?
[154:33.78]Clap for me.
[154:34.46]Take pictures of me and clap for me again.

[173:53.38]Cerebral lesion?
[174:08.35]I had it.
[174:08.65]I can do it.
[174:09.11]I can do that.
[174:09.55]I can do it.
[174:09.87]I can do it.
[174:10.19]I can do it.
[174:11.79]Watch.
[174:12.19]Watch this.
[174:17.22]It's gonna be easy.
[174:20.50]Someone asking about toothbrushes?
[174:21.92]What?
[174:24.81]We heard that.
[174:25.79]That was a cerebral lesion.
[174:32.32]Change of plan.
[174:33.50]Because they can hear me punch this guy.
[174:35.02]It's going to have to be... Okay, ready for the plan?
[174:38.34]It's going to be crowbar, that guy's face, bullet, bullet.
[174:40.22]I'm going to stand, like, right here.
[174:41.95]Quick!
[174:42.07]What?
[175:01.36]Target spotted.
[175:02.24]Repeat, target spotted.
[175:03.28]No!
[175:03.62]What the hell is going on?
[175:04.68]Oh, my God!
[175:09.68]Fuck.
[175:11.62]That was it, too.
[175:12.82]Somebody... Who heard anything?
[175:22.07]Jeremy, you're dumb.
[175:23.57]I'm just funning.
[175:24.43]I'm just having fun.
[175:25.47]I'm a powerful woman in the dark.
[175:33.81]If this happens in fun, that's all that matters.
[175:36.63]Nobody in this room.
[175:38.75]One guy there.
[175:39.31]I don't know what this does.
[175:46.86]Something happened.
[175:48.76]Okay, I eliminated one of my targets.
[175:58.44]What the fuck are you doing?
[176:02.18]What is this?
[176:03.00]What?
[176:06.16]What the hell?
[176:08.28]They're just taking bodies out?
[176:12.02]I wish I could blend in as 47.
[176:17.80]That's kind of dumb.
[176:24.66]I need some, like, shitty guy that's by himself.
[176:30.28]Where's, like, the one more... I can't dress up.
[176:33.11]I can't even put her clothes on.
[176:35.41]Can I?
[176:36.63]No, I don't think I can.
[176:37.51]That would be very suspicious, wouldn't it?
[176:48.88]Guy?
[176:49.64]No, that's a guy with a gun.
[176:53.10]What is this?
[176:54.72]Scissors?
[176:55.86]Thank you.
[176:56.56]What's up?
[176:57.32]Hey, what's up?
[177:02.27]Okay, guys.
[177:02.83]I'm just an assassin.
[177:03.67]Computer.
[177:04.13]Steal the data.
[177:05.56]Sure thing.
[177:06.50]Letter opener.
[177:06.88]Let's test it.
[177:07.36]Works pretty well.
[177:08.30]That lady sneezed.
[177:08.84]That was a sneeze.
[177:09.36]I killed that lady so bad she sneezed.
[177:37.05]I can't... I'm already wearing this disguise?
[177:42.37]Can I get my letter opener back?
[177:58.10]Screwdriver.
[178:02.66]I'm gonna have to go to a different room.
[178:04.00]I need to sit down there and see what happens.
[178:05.55]It's important.
[178:07.03]Next up, Classified Documentary in the shipping sector of Japan.
[178:13.24]Oh, fuck it.
[178:14.18]Not even gonna work.
[178:14.94]Tango, Tango, move to my position.
[178:19.19]That guy's got to roll the dice.
[178:31.85]Is the gang going to forget where I am?
[178:34.05]I guess I can't even do it.
[178:35.03]Oh well.
[178:35.40]Hey, he disappeared.
[178:35.92]Give me a place to drop.
[178:37.38]Nice.
[178:37.56]Oh, look it.
[178:38.12]I can get on the pipe and slide down.
[178:40.32]You didn't think I saw the pipe exit.
[178:43.40]Well, you guys are wrong.
[178:44.30]Yeah.
[179:03.45]Here we go.
[179:05.87]And slide.
[179:10.65]Perfect.
[179:12.78]Let's get in that helicopter.
[179:14.76]But first, help.
[179:47.77]You psycho, I know.
[179:49.01]Why did I do that?
[179:50.67]You don't see me running across right now?
[179:53.67]Get in!
[179:55.43]Get in!
[179:55.86]Let's get out of here.
[180:07.97]That was very stealthy.
[180:08.99]A stealthy way to exit, I know.
[180:24.34]Speaking of Dishonored, somebody said Dishonored.
[180:26.54]I'm probably gonna play that on launch.
[180:27.88]It seems fun.
[180:30.33]How was Moscow?
[180:31.97]Kamorov is gone.
[180:34.11]Thank you Krish312 for nine months.

[183:31.67]Cheese Grater, thanks for subbing.
[183:34.03]Link, fan of the year for eight months.
[183:35.09]Been around since your first one life video.
[183:37.77]Have watched everything you've ever produced.
[183:39.13]I regret nothing.
[183:41.09]Well, thank you.
[183:43.15]Very much appreciated.
[183:43.95]Kubwano, thanks also a lot.
[183:45.79]You guys are fucking subbing the shit out of me tonight.
[183:47.99]Wait, what?
[183:50.87]I'm getting a lot of sub the shit out of me.
[183:52.37]Alright, I'm going to grab a drink.
[183:54.09]I'll be right back.
[183:54.71]We're going to go on to World of Tomorrow.
[183:57.65]Beer.
[184:00.79]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[184:01.93]How come it's not showing up?
[184:05.83]Oh, there we go.
[184:10.02]Be right back.
[184:33.20]Yeah.
[187:00.15]Hello.
[187:02.63]Let's keep going.
[187:04.33]Let's do World of Tomorrow.
[187:07.33]Here comes a cutscene.
[187:09.78]Hope you guys are ready for the cutscene.
[187:13.84]Thanks a lot, DyslexicCobra.
[187:14.92]Thanks for the sub.
[187:16.56]And here we go.
[187:17.26]Good morning, 47.
[187:17.66]Good morning, 47.
[187:19.08]The destination is the coastal town of Sapienza, also known as the Jewel of the Amalfi Coast.
[187:25.41]Your target is a former client of ours, Silvio Caruso.
[187:29.24]a brilliant but troubled bioengineer employed by the Ether Biotech Corporation.
[187:34.84]Renowned for his early stem cell research, Caruso is now reportedly working on a far more disturbing project, a DNA-specific virus able to infect anyone, anywhere in the world.
[187:48.92]Imagine a bullet, fired in any direction, passing through countless bodies without inflicting harm, invisible and undetectable until it strikes its target.
[187:59.11]Pretty terrifying.
[188:01.07]A world of armchair assassins killing with impunity.
[188:05.23]This is what awaits us unless Caruso is stopped.
[188:10.49]Our client, one of Ether's major private stockholders, wants the project canceled on ethical grounds, but without destroying the company in the process.
[188:19.88]She has asked us to eliminate Silvio Caruso and destroy the yet unfinished virus prototype.
[188:28.03]You will also need to deal with Caruso's lab head, Francesca DeSantis, a high-level ether employee... Oh, look at this, like, fucking pixel game.
[188:35.68]...who holds intimate knowledge of Caruso's research... Pixel game in 2016.
[188:37.94]Oh, pixels.
[188:38.48]...and could potentially carry on in his place.
[188:43.74]This is no ordinary contract, 47.
[188:46.63]Caruso's virus is a serious threat to our craft and trade, not to mention our core ideals.
[188:52.37]T-virus.
[188:52.91]So failure is not an option.
[188:55.61]I'll leave you to prepare.
[188:59.87]Alright.
[189:08.69]Alright.
[189:09.19]Planning.
[189:09.87]Look at how cool I look.
[189:10.85]Italian suit.
[189:11.63]Yeah, I'm going to stay with the Italian suit.
[189:13.05]Are you kidding me?
[189:16.89]Silenced.
[189:18.60]Gear.
[189:21.74]Explosive device.
[189:22.80]You never know when you're going to need an explosive device.
[189:26.60]Coins useful.
[189:28.24]We'll stay with the coin.
[189:33.41]Eliminate.
[189:34.59]Gotta get rid of this person.
[189:35.72]They're gonna destroy the virus.
[189:40.50]Star, what the fuck are you doing?
[189:44.58]What are you talking about?
[189:47.92]Thank you, Dr. Faps.
[189:49.70]Haunt Machine for two months.
[189:51.05]And JL Groves for subscriptions.
[189:53.77]Welcome, dudes.
[189:54.73]Welcome back to Haunt Machine.
[189:58.31]I destroy anything doing anything these two and get rid of the virus.
[190:03.40]I'm ready.
[190:03.72]Let's get started.
[190:07.09]Alright, let's get started.
[190:14.51]What is this new like copy paste thing that's in the chat now?
[190:29.32]Grow some damn hair.
[190:30.26]Yeah, I know.
[190:30.76]Ooh, this is cool.
[190:31.80]The beach.
[190:32.38]Oh, no.
[190:32.52]I've got to go underground train tracks.
[190:33.92]Alright.
[190:55.33]In the clear!
[190:55.77]I have to do it every time!
[190:57.45]You have to do it!
[190:58.33]There's no way you start a mission unless you do that every time.
[191:03.37]Use your fists the whole time?
[191:06.53]I have to only use fists?
[191:07.97]No.
[191:25.34]Perfect start.
[191:26.90]Use your whole fist this time, you fucking coward.
[191:47.63]What the fuck?
[191:50.47]Why?
[191:51.77]No, I wanted to do it like a Junkrat, like you throw it up and detonate it.
[191:55.82]Where is it?
[191:56.48]Where's my detonator?
[191:59.96]There.
[192:01.16]I did it.
[192:05.43]What the fuck?
[192:06.01]I just want to do my one goof.
[192:09.31]There's one goof.
[192:10.67]All I asked for was one goof.
[192:12.53]The whole mission.
[192:13.97]Was that a coin?
[192:16.84]Hold on, that was not a coin.
[192:21.94]That was absolutely not a coin.
[192:28.70]Oh, it's a proximity explosive.
[192:30.56]You have to get, like, near it.
[192:36.15]Oh, god.
[192:36.89]Okay.
[192:38.96]That makes things a lot more ridiculous.
[192:44.92]Hey!
[192:47.26]You gotta be kidding me.
[192:49.32]I need help!
[192:49.72]Help!
[192:49.84]What are you doing?
[192:52.10]What?
[192:52.32]Oh my god.
[192:54.13]Oh my god, you did this?
[192:56.57]You sick murderer!
[192:57.29]Why would you do that?
[192:58.83]I was trying to get the guy to walk down the stairs.
[193:04.55]And she just fucking sprinted on top of it.
[193:07.73]Yeah.
[193:14.56]I spent the whole time trying to get that guy to come down, and she's just like, oh shit, I better run over that.
[193:27.85]Oh my god, he threw something on the ground.
[193:29.89]I should sprint at it.
[193:32.54]Fucking idiot.
[193:34.10]Alright, okay, we're done.
[193:35.54]We are done.
[193:36.58]Let's play the mission.
[193:38.60]God fucking damn it.
[193:40.04]Okay, okay.
[193:41.20]Okay, I gotta stop.
[193:43.86]I'm done.
[193:44.26]No more.
[193:45.06]No more.
[193:46.36]Somebody just laughed.
[193:48.33]Whoa.
[194:00.10]I just... Somebody just went... Get in the dumpster.
[194:22.79]Yikes.
[194:23.21]Uh-oh.
[194:32.68]Oh, watch out for the chef.
[194:35.42]Oh my god, is that guy still around?
[194:37.66]I'm not sure what he's supposed to be looking around for, but I'm scared of the last.
[194:42.15]Oh, shit.
[194:43.09]Did he go that way?
[194:45.09]I don't know.
[194:47.45]Dummies.
[194:47.65]Please, no.
[194:51.23]Everything is under control.
[194:55.57]I'm going to disguise as the chef.
[194:58.93]I hear you, loud and clear.
[195:07.99]He had the key.
[195:08.37]That was the mayor.
[195:09.25]I just killed the mayor.
[195:09.77]I got the town hall key.
[195:12.53]Are you serious?
[195:18.33]Dumpster.
[195:18.67]What do you mean I'm surrounded?
[195:21.59]Who's even here?
[195:23.95]Somebody's here?
[195:25.68]Where's the...
[195:34.20]Alright, I got the key to the town hall.
[195:41.48]Apparently this guy is like the mayor of the city.
[195:45.06]Somehow.
[195:46.78]Saving it.
[195:52.93]Challenge complete.
[195:54.51]Not even that hard of a game.
[195:55.35]If I'm going to be honest here.
[195:56.79]Alright, where...
[196:01.01]Oh, I thought it was telling me I could ride that bike.
[196:03.61]Who's still following me?
[196:04.75]Get the fuck out of here.
[196:05.91]What?
[196:08.86]Fuck off.
[196:14.68]You guys still freaking out about the guy that... Oh, cool.
[196:20.23]Let's get some gelato.
[196:22.69]Yeah, I'm the kind of dad who takes my kid out after my wife has said no ice cream, buys the ice cream, and then says don't... Feel free to shove me.
[196:30.95]No, please.
[196:32.97]Different voice.
[196:33.96]Completely different actor.
[196:38.16]Yeah, I'm the kind of guy that... Hey, you!
[196:40.14]Hey, you!
[196:42.18]What are you talking about?
[196:45.10]Why?
[196:45.98]Why am I just getting followed?
[196:47.40]Lost sight of him.
[196:50.43]Move to a better position.
[196:52.40]Fuck you and your music.
[196:58.98]Give me a cake.
[197:02.72]Give me the knife.
[197:04.21]Target in sight.
[197:09.61]Target, just one!
[197:22.44]God damn it.
[197:26.60]Why don't you touch me like you used to?
[197:29.86]Well, thank you, Verilic, for those 1500 bits.
[197:35.25]Give us that raw Italian accent.
[197:38.23]I might as well be playing GTA.
[197:41.97]I know.
[197:42.55]Dude, it's too much fun to do this dumb shit.
[197:44.72]Watch out for the guy behind me.
[197:45.84]I can't stop.
[197:49.85]Alright, let's get some intel here.
[197:53.32]Cue to the safe house somewhere in town.
[197:55.34]Track it.
[197:58.96]What the hell is this?
[198:00.34]By candlelight, by absolution, hostile environment, memento.
[198:05.56]Good son, first day on the job, beyond the grave, memory lane.
[198:08.72]I kind of want to do this one.
[198:12.82]Track this one.
[198:18.29]Oh, I can unlock this door.
[198:23.66]You look like you've done something you shouldn't.
[198:25.48]Am I right?
[198:26.34]Don't even tell me that guy's still fucking behind me.
[198:28.84]I swear to God.
[198:30.08]Yep, he's just following me now.
[198:31.22]I need to make this quick.
[198:32.10]I need to close every door.
[198:33.00]I need to close every... Close every door.
[198:40.53]He's still following me?
[198:44.53]Alright, what can I do in here?
[198:46.71]Giant ice cream cone?
[198:47.55]Nothing?
[198:47.75]Nothing?
[198:51.15]Haha, funny.
[198:51.95]Who plays games for objectives?
[198:57.23]I just think it's fun, this open world calamity.
[198:59.97]It's just fun.
[199:04.41]I don't even have a current mission right now.
[199:06.73]I need to find something to track.
[199:08.29]My FPS just kind of died.
[199:11.89]Let me look at the map.
[199:21.37]How do I even get there?
[199:28.74]Alright.
[199:31.08]There's the target.
[199:33.46]One of the targets, at least.
[199:34.42]I'm going to try to break in here first.
[199:37.12]So I'm going to go over here.
[199:39.56]Objective.
[199:40.98]Alright, let's do it.
[199:43.10]So that's this way?
[199:44.50]Okay.
[199:44.86]Am I allowed to go in here now that I'm like a chef?
[199:46.96]Can I come in?
[199:47.56]Get frisked.
[199:48.34]Oh.
[199:48.46]Yeah, hold on.
[199:49.26]Just give me a second.
[199:50.47]Give me one second.
[200:12.47]Okay.
[200:15.15]You can first me.
[200:16.51]Pat me down.
[200:18.91]I'm clean.
[200:21.25]Why would I even knock him out?
[200:23.95]Is there a reason why I would knock him out right now in broad daylight?
[200:27.49]Hey, hey, watch those hands.
[200:28.45]Watch those hands.
[200:29.07]Spit in that guy's face.
[200:30.23]Oh, Jesus.
[200:40.53]Hi, Wuffin.
[200:44.25]Wait a second.
[200:44.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:46.11]Am I... Okay.
[200:47.71]For a second, I almost just threw up.
[200:51.96]Fucking 10,000 bits.
[200:53.34]Jesus, dude.
[200:55.08]He's back.
[200:56.18]The madman has returned.
[200:57.50]Hey, what's for dinner, cookie?
[200:59.83]Can I walk in here?
[201:03.53]Thanks for the 100 bucks, dude.
[201:06.12]You are... You spoil the shit out of me.
[201:09.43]And I don't know why.
[201:11.05]But thank you.
[201:16.83]What about the butler?
[201:18.17]I think I should be the butler now.
[201:19.17]Oh.
[201:21.39]I knew I was supposed to be here.
[201:23.95]Alright, there's target.
[201:24.81]What is this?
[201:35.39]Can I ride it?
[201:35.89]Can I ride this thing?
[201:39.27]Please let me ride it.
[201:44.29]Oh, come on.
[201:44.89]I can't ride that thing.
[201:47.57]Bullshit.
[201:49.00]Alright, let's save it.
[201:56.74]I won a hundred bucks.
[202:03.56]Uh...
[202:06.08]I see a weapon.
[202:10.24]Pick it up.
[202:13.43]I can't pick up the mop and use it as a weapon.
[202:15.37]That sucks.
[202:16.39]I would love to do that.
[202:25.51]I've been recorded by a security camera.
[202:27.05]Okay.
[202:27.97]Well, can I go up the stairs?
[202:29.83]Will they let me go up the stairs?
[202:32.37]Out of the fucking way.
[202:39.30]No, overflow sink.
[202:41.92]I'm just going to go up.
[202:45.22]Let's follow the chair up.
[202:47.11]Why not, right?
[202:47.59]Where is she?
[202:48.97]She's down there.
[202:50.17]I wonder if I can get the jump on her somehow.
[202:55.35]I can't be up there.
[202:58.21]Are you the only one?
[202:59.53]Are you the only one?
[203:00.33]He's the only guy?
[203:01.01]Only guy, right?
[203:02.75]Come over here.
[203:03.99]Only one.
[203:05.05]Only one.
[203:05.41]He's the only one.
[203:05.99]I don't have a gun.
[203:10.20]What is he doing?
[203:12.62]He doesn't even care.
[203:26.11]I don't know where I'm going.
[203:28.55]What's that?
[203:29.81]Disguise as a housekeeper.
[203:31.53]Oh!
[203:44.93]What?!
[203:51.59]He made that very clear that he wasn't gonna shoot it.
[203:53.55]I thought he was gonna be like, oh, okay.
[204:03.61]They shoot so fast when they shoot.
[204:05.15]They just unload a whole clip in five seconds.
[204:09.18]I need a guard costume.
[204:11.02]So one of these guys are... Who's out here?
[204:17.58]Oh, no.
[204:18.90]Am I about to spend the next, like, fucking ten minutes over here?
[204:21.52]Can I get to the boat?
[204:26.11]I can't even go in here.
[204:28.71]That's horseshit.
[204:29.87]You can't even go in the water.
[204:33.70]wow unbelievable that is truly unbelievable and there's a dock with people fishing on it oh boy how's that cigarette I hope it's good because it's the last one you're ever gonna smoke
[205:02.23]And I'll take his gun.
[205:06.19]And I will just slowly drag him over here.
[205:08.81]And we're going to go on the dock.
[205:12.75]Huh?
[205:14.20]Oh, shit.
[205:15.22]Does he have a key card?
[205:18.28]Key card?
[205:21.46]No.
[205:22.80]Oh, whatever.
[205:23.18]Screw it.
[205:23.54]Let's just get down there.
[205:24.85]How do I get to the dock?
[205:25.57]Do we go all the way down?
[205:34.99]Is that just for show, or can I actually go down there somehow?
[205:41.84]Let's find out.
[205:45.26]Ooh, what's this?
[205:46.24]Screwdriver?
[205:48.36]Hammer?
[205:50.75]Please, shovel.
[205:52.53]Shovel.
[205:53.99]Shovel.
[205:55.37]I got it.
[205:57.41]Well, now the game really starts.
[206:07.96]I'm going to crush this guy's head.
[206:15.64]Maybe not.
[206:17.10]Can I throw this at him?
[206:25.09]Shovel for shovel?
[206:25.87]Okay, I can have two shovels.
[206:32.62]Good thing that I got a replacement shovel.
[206:33.84]I got more shovel ammo over here.
[206:35.12]That's good.
[206:35.38]Watch out!
[206:42.83]Let me replenish my shovel ammo quick.
[206:54.36]Throw it down the cliff.
[206:55.74]I want to get to the dock.
[206:57.50]I don't care about the mission right now.
[207:04.93]Get me down there.
[207:05.65]I want to have fun down here.
[207:07.69]Are they going to be mad that I have a shovel?
[207:09.75]I think so.
[207:11.83]No, I'm going to have a new save file.
[207:13.29]This is going to be just a shit show.
[207:21.59]Oh, no.
[207:22.11]Why did they have this here?
[207:24.28]They made this specifically because they knew I wasn't going to be able to do anything but this.
[207:28.30]You know what I mean?
[207:31.84]Like, this only exists because they know that I'm going to do this.
[207:34.72]Okay.
[207:41.84]Alright, I'm sorry.
[207:42.68]Throwing a guy in the water is not going to kill him.
[207:48.86]That's not gonna happen.
[208:07.44]Tossing a guy into the water is not going to hurt him.
[208:12.69]That's not how it works.
[208:17.23]Why is he sinking?
[208:21.69]It doesn't make any sense.
[208:23.51]I don't get it.
[208:25.13]Oh no, I'm dead now.
[208:26.18]That means I sink like a fucking cement brick.
[208:29.58]It's okay, guys.
[208:30.28]There's more people to do this to.
[208:34.84]What was it?
[208:35.42]An explosion or something?
[208:42.04]Nah, nothing like that.
[208:43.24]Make sure I pick that up on the way back.
[208:44.57]Alright, here's the deal.
[208:47.51]I'm going to see if I can... I don't want to push him off.
[208:52.59]I'm going to make him go off.
[208:55.37]Does it still kill him?
[208:57.73]Will he still die?
[209:01.46]Oh, pardon me.
[209:02.72]I didn't see you there, sir.
[209:06.18]No, I don't think I can.
[209:06.98]Nope.
[209:07.28]That's too bad.
[209:07.78]Alright, you can go back to your business now.
[209:09.58]I'm done.
[209:09.98]Crime noticed.
[209:11.01]Alright.
[209:11.17]Yeah, sorry.
[209:11.45]I walked up to you a couple times.
[209:15.31]That was a crime, apparently.
[209:34.64]Talk to me.
[209:35.10]What's going on?
[209:36.24]Act your age, man.
[209:37.78]Seriously?
[209:38.56]This guy?
[209:39.40]Wow.
[209:40.23]Stay here just in case.
[209:42.75]What is going on?
[209:44.39]Oh, that guy's coming up here.
[209:46.25]No, no, no.
[209:46.97]You're wrong.
[209:48.13]All wrong.
[209:49.25]Stop!
[209:49.59]Someone, please help me!
[210:02.68]Hey!
[210:04.16]Don't walk into us like that again!
[210:05.84]Alright, now I'm just gonna push him in.
[210:08.25]Fuck it.
[210:13.11]That'll teach you to loiter.
[210:15.91]That'll teach you to do stuff like that.
[210:18.17]So can I get all three of them pushed in?
[210:19.84]Before anyone notices?
[210:20.60]What do you think?
[210:22.32]Whoa!
[210:23.24]Whoa.
[210:25.38]Hey!
[210:26.00]Oh my god!
[210:26.84]Stop!
[210:30.47]Something's going down.
[210:31.69]Stay on your toes.
[210:32.19]You suck!
[210:32.73]Knockin' people out?
[210:33.81]What the hell?
[210:34.13]Ding.
[210:40.25]Drown him.
[210:40.47]Quick, drown them all.
[210:41.07]Someone, I need help right now.
[210:45.87]Target's turtled up.
[210:50.43]Hmmmm. Ah!
[211:05.93]This is like a completely different game.
[211:09.94]I'm not even playing Hitman anymore.
[211:11.36]It's not Hitman.
[211:15.94]You have no way out.
[211:17.54]I'd strongly advise you to give up.
[211:19.36]You hear me?
[211:23.13]Yeah, back away.
[211:24.51]Huh?
[211:25.49]Ah!
[211:27.35]Alright.
[211:27.69]We're done.
[211:28.79]Had our fun.
[211:29.91]Let's keep moving.
[211:33.01]Hold your fire.
[211:33.59]He disappeared.
[211:38.33]Just trying to catch the big one.
[211:43.21]Yeah, why is that a cutscene?
[211:48.49]Anything of value down here that I could use or do.
[211:53.23]Why would you have all this shit if I can't do anything?
[211:57.25]Nope.
[212:00.20]There's a coin.
[212:05.94]Hey, pick that up!
[212:08.86]It went in the water.
[212:09.54]I can't.
[212:09.88]I thought he was taking a picture of it.
[212:19.23]I just want to get him to the point where I can push him.
[212:37.32]Alright, well, whatever.
[212:38.44]Let's go.
[212:44.38]Nothing of interest here besides people.
[212:47.51]No.
[212:48.03]Hold on.
[212:57.83]No, don't sit on the bench.
[212:58.71]Go look at the wall.
[213:03.99]Get a little closer to that edge.
[213:12.35]I did.
[213:12.63]Oh, come on!
[213:15.30]Come on!
[213:16.80]Come on!
[213:17.98]Get close enough to the water!
[213:19.18]Oh, you dingus.
[213:22.62]Alright, that kept... This guy just wanted to enjoy his ice cream and I just broke his back.
[213:44.27]Oh, come on.
[213:45.89]Where's my shovel?
[213:50.85]Oh, this is so perfect.
[213:57.09]I completely forgot about the mission.
[213:58.40]I don't even care anymore.
[214:01.44]Can I just step on this guy's head?
[214:07.54]I don't think I can stomp his head.
[214:08.64]Nope.
[214:13.88]I can't do anything.
[214:14.88]I thought that was a real alligator.
[214:19.50]Um... Alright, how's this guy gonna go?
[214:21.08]Screwdriver?
[214:22.32]Screwdriver?
[214:22.82]Yeah, I think so.
[214:29.35]Hey, you!
[214:30.01]Huh?
[214:31.37]What?
[214:34.15]Wait, what the... That went down his fucking throat.
[214:54.31]Wow, that guy was more fucked up than I am.
[215:01.09]Closed casket.
[215:02.91]My god.
[215:03.71]Was that Mr. Stark?
[215:14.46]Destroy the evil virus.
[215:15.68]Alright, what if I annoy that guy?
[215:19.58]I'm going to try it.
[215:21.66]Let's see.
[215:22.12]I'm not going to kill him.
[215:23.14]I'm just going to make him annoyed.
[215:24.46]Alright.
[215:28.36]It's going to hit him right in the chest.
[215:33.25]Is he going to lie down again?
[215:35.67]Wait a minute.
[215:36.59]Did you just see that?
[215:51.57]When he was on his way down, I just had a shot to hit him in the head.
[215:56.99]You guys saw that.
[216:06.84]Now my curiosity's been piqued.
[216:08.84]We've got to do something.
[216:11.58]Distract him with one, pull up the other one, and try to hit him in the head.
[216:14.90]Because that was really weird.
[216:21.30]If I can get it, it'll be fun.
[216:25.12]Let's try it.
[216:25.50]Because right when he was about to go down, I had the reticle.
[216:31.60]The thing was on his head.
[216:33.50]So let's try it.
[216:35.38]Screwdriver to annoy him.
[216:41.98]And then, ready?
[216:42.66]Here we go.
[216:43.42]Go down.
[216:43.84]Go down.
[216:44.12]Go down.
[216:53.92]Let's go lie down.
[216:58.22]Shit.
[217:01.20]Gonna try it one more time.
[217:03.46]Rectical.
[217:04.64]What did I say?
[217:08.42]Rectical.
[217:10.55]Rectical.
[217:11.15]Cuticle.
[217:12.35]Cuticle.
[217:13.59]Cuticle.
[217:24.47]It seems really glitchy when he lies back down that it's possible to do.
[217:27.71]Maybe if I stand a little closer.
[217:37.15]Yeah, you gotta get it right on his head.
[217:42.76]Because right now it's pointing right at his head.
[217:45.70]I have to follow him down.
[217:46.86]Nope.
[217:55.01]I don't think it can work.
[218:01.90]Control anger?
[218:03.20]I'm trying to do a very specific stupid thing.
[218:19.09]What am I trying to do?
[218:19.85]I'm trying to, as he lies down, throw it.
[218:21.95]So it, like, fucks up his whole AI.
[218:24.39]And makes it so he doesn't go down and he just freaks out and gets killed.
[218:29.52]Alright, moving on.
[218:32.20]I have a homicidal addiction.
[218:36.30]Thank you, Polaratum.
[218:38.78]Polarautum.
[218:40.25]Thanks for the thousand bits, dude.
[218:41.23]Appreciate it.
[218:42.75]Thank you very much.
[218:50.14]Oh, I'm sorry.
[218:50.84]Oh, another guy.
[218:52.54]Another person lying down.
[218:54.98]I can't stop.
[218:56.12]You guys know this is such a fucking... When I go to the casino, you guys talking about how I can't stop?
[219:01.81]This is like the casino times ten.
[219:04.15]I can't stop.
[219:05.07]Wait, what?
[219:06.25]You know what I mean?
[219:07.29]I have to do this.
[219:08.85]I'm lined up.
[219:10.59]I got him.
[219:11.57]Are you a psycho?
[219:15.02]You just killed someone.
[219:19.37]I think I'm alright.
[219:19.99]I actually think I'm in the clear.
[219:21.89]Okay, let's go.
[219:22.27]I just had to, like, upside the head that guy.
[219:24.47]Very addictive personality.
[219:30.77]It's just open world dumb shit.
[219:31.81]I love it.
[219:52.58]I love every second of it.
[219:57.60]You guys wonder why GTA is, like, one of my favorite games ever.
[219:59.84]Because you can just be a total psych- What is going on here?
[220:05.01]This guy is dressed like a Dark Souls enemy.
[220:10.51]God damn it.
[220:12.87]Every single time, I- No.
[220:14.89]Oh, what the fuck is this guy saying?
[220:16.07]Fuck.
[220:21.88]Ugh, poison is water.
[220:25.62]There's just so many people that just... Like, they put this guy here because they know that you're gonna, like, punch him in the face.
[220:33.61]That's why this guy exists.
[220:35.39]It's a guy in a funny costume.
[220:38.25]Like, I'm gonna do this.
[220:40.83]You know what I'm saying?
[220:47.16]You can't do that.
[220:48.84]Stop.
[220:49.16]Now I'm the clown.
[221:04.35]I gotta be the clown.
[221:06.69]Are you kidding me?
[221:08.31]The rest of the game I have to be the clown.
[221:12.58]Yeah.
[221:17.50]How do I get to be... There's no way I can be that clown.
[221:19.84]It's not possible.
[221:24.83]I mean, he can drink the poison, but he'll die.
[221:27.63]Okay, I just interrupted his show.
[221:31.15]I don't have any poison.
[221:33.47]No, we're gonna move on.
[221:34.45]Let's actually... Let's move on.
[221:36.78]We're having lots of fun here.
[221:38.58]But let's find some intel.
[221:41.30]This is a boiler room.
[221:42.25]Good intel.
[221:43.51]Alright.
[221:46.21]Up this way.
[221:51.49]There's probably something of interest in this room.
[221:52.89]Why would I be able to come in here?
[222:10.44]Break the fucking glass.
[222:19.10]Just give me it.
[222:19.96]Go.
[222:22.58]Bulletproof glass in like this run-down house.
[222:27.10]Huh?
[222:27.47]What?
[222:28.27]Ring the bell?
[222:38.21]Hello?
[222:46.70]Hello?
[222:52.87]Is nobody in here?
[222:53.43]You can't unlock the door either.
[223:05.59]Last try.
[223:06.79]Anybody home?
[223:10.37]Open the fucking door.
[223:13.87]Here's a doorbell for you.
[223:15.05]There's nobody even here.
[223:17.32]Cool.
[223:21.32]Alright, bye.
[223:28.27]Lockpick?
[223:28.77]I don't have a lockpick on me.
[223:29.77]At least I don't think I do.
[223:32.69]No, I don't.
[223:39.84]Whose house is that?
[223:42.16]Ooh, intel!
[223:42.64]Ah, do I detect a certain attraction to the

[224:55.14]What are you doing?
[225:02.19]Oh, he's tying his shoe.

[226:20.66]God damn it.

[231:55.42]He's going to call mom.
[231:56.20]You're never going to believe it.
[231:57.90]Picked up a fucking coin, mom.
[232:10.17]Trying to drown out his conversation.
[232:16.93]Okay.
[232:18.31]I have to take his disguise?
[232:25.44]Sure thing.
[232:29.22]Oh, cigarettes.
[232:30.66]Oh, I love cigarettes.
[232:33.86]Don't do it.
[232:35.04]Follow the guy.
[232:35.60]Don't get that close.
[232:39.44]Don't get that.
[232:40.04]This guy's been trying to figure out which one of these is his fucking mailbox.
[232:43.70]For about 10 minutes.
[232:47.94]Dummy.
[232:50.91]Evening, ma'am.
[232:53.55]Well, that was a good one.
[232:55.43]Quick, get in the dumpster, quick!
[232:56.27]Are those just flies?
[233:02.62]Ah, you like my new cologne?
[233:05.74]It's called trash.
[233:15.95]Oh, it's a good thing he repeated the place he was going to, like people normally do in conversations.
[233:21.44]Yeah, so we're meeting at the pier in downtown Boston at 4 p.m.
[233:27.54]sharp, right?
[233:28.18]I remember that place.
[233:37.47]Where's my opportunity to do this?
[233:38.65]It's going to happen soon, right?
[233:46.82]He's gonna go in a building, so I don't have to do it in broad daylight.
[233:49.46]I don't understand here.
[233:50.48]That guy finally got his mail.
[234:03.10]There's too many people around.
[234:04.12]I wish I could just take off on one of these bikes.
[234:18.80]Alright, this might be a good spot to do it when he goes in here.
[234:22.58]No, he's stopping.
[234:24.20]No, he's going again.
[234:28.84]I was about to turn around and throw the hammer at that lady.
[234:31.25]What a mistake that would have been.
[234:32.45]I want to push her in the well so bad.
[234:33.45]Hold on.
[234:39.67]Good luck!
[234:42.74]Got it!
[234:43.42]She did like a cannonball.
[234:44.70]She pulled her legs up.
[234:46.90]She did like a flip into the pool.
[235:09.41]Make a wish.
[235:16.58]Alright, get in.
[235:19.96]Get in there.
[235:21.68]Get in there with him.
[235:22.94]How do I get in there?
[235:28.40]He's at the bottom of the well.
[235:29.47]I just gotta get to the bottom of the well.
[235:35.07]Just gotta sneak into the sewer system.
[235:37.70]How do I get down to the sewer?
[235:39.28]Really?
[235:41.84]And I can get his costume.
[235:44.66]It's right down there.
[235:45.61]Why can't I fall in?
[235:46.67]Why can't I throw myself in there?
[235:47.97]This guy's asleep.
[236:16.49]He's not in here.
[236:17.29]I swear to God.
[236:20.66]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[236:24.36]Alright, let's do it for real.
[236:34.07]Church or beach?
[236:35.83]No, I'm going to follow him again.
[236:36.89]I'm not going to do it again.
[236:38.63]Don't worry.
[236:41.13]This is supposed to be a stealth game at some point?
[236:42.79]Yeah.
[236:44.83]I'm not sure I've seen you before.
[236:46.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[236:48.44]That didn't happen last time.
[236:56.20]Like shooting germs in a hamper.
[237:07.27]Okay.
[237:09.39]This guy's asleep over here.
[237:10.59]I wish I could just get rid of him.
[237:14.83]It's Sal.
[237:16.91]Body phone.
[237:18.37]What did I tell you, Curly?
[237:20.01]Once a cheat, always a cheat.
[237:23.23]Trust me, Curly.
[237:24.27]There's nothing I would like to do more than follow your wife around town.
[237:29.25]Are politics permabanned?
[237:30.44]No.
[237:30.58]But, you know, I'm on a case down in Sapienza.
[237:34.20]Keep it to a minimum.
[237:35.56]Didn't Marlena in reception tell you?
[237:38.72]I'd rather talk about me throwing guys in a well.
[237:43.08]Okay, I don't want to have to listen to that conversation again, so I'm saving.
[237:57.21]Is there a quick save button?
[237:58.55]Like, please tell me what it is.
[237:59.78]Is it like F4 or something?
[238:01.68]Oh, fuck, he's looking at me.
[238:02.84]Who's that?
[238:07.14]At least I saved it right there.
[238:15.39]Flanker for first noble.
[238:25.87]It's control S. Is it control S?
[238:27.35]Alright, don't look at me this time.
[238:37.22]Control S?
[238:37.74]That doesn't seem to do it.
[238:45.96]Alright, this is my chance.
[238:48.13]Here's the opportunity.
[238:51.49]What the fuck?
[238:52.23]Why are you doing that?
[238:53.31]Why would you do that?
[238:53.91]Get me in here.
[238:59.03]Let me just take a moment to look over my shoulder.
[239:04.65]He's gonna go take a piss.
[239:14.83]What a way to go.
[239:16.33]What a way to go.
[239:20.05]Thanks for the disguise.
[239:27.97]See ya.
[239:31.21]Save it.
[239:35.81]Look at that coin, too.
[239:37.43]Is that my coin from earlier that he picked up?
[239:40.85]Okay, meet with DeSantis on the pier.
[239:43.57]Kill a Crocomire.
[239:45.21]1,500 bits.
[239:45.65]Thanks, dude!
[239:46.71]I shouldn't tell you this, but there is a battle axe in this level.
[239:48.98]Yes, those huge axes you can use in this game.
[239:53.80]Thanks for the 1,500, but there's a battle axe here.
[240:00.14]Where is it?
[240:01.48]Please tell me where it is.
[240:02.70]Because I want to go get it right now.
[240:10.33]Pigeons!
[240:12.65]Watch out for the pigeons.
[240:21.63]I can't vault over that.
[240:22.42]Come on.
[240:31.02]Don't tell him?
[240:32.50]That guy's just like, don't tell him where it is.
[240:34.26]This level will never end if I know where it is.
[240:41.47]Alright, let's meet.
[240:51.23]And then I'm going to immediately push whoever this is into the water.
[240:56.19]Should be fun.
[241:03.92]Yes, it is.
[241:06.76]There's my shovel from earlier.
[241:13.85]That's one of my targets, right?
[241:18.11]What a perfect murder weapon.
[241:19.19]Hmm, okay.
[241:19.37]Walk with me.
[241:19.73]Walk with me and talk with me.
[241:44.95]Mission accomplished.
[241:46.37]You guys thought I was going to fail this one?
[241:48.49]Not this time.
[241:49.33]I failed it.
[241:52.11]He just can't stop.
[242:16.99]The shovel was in the perfect spot, you've got to admit.
[242:22.21]Will she get mad if I pick the shovel up?
[242:24.33]She'll be angry.
[242:27.63]I need to find out.
[242:28.75]Let's see.
[242:29.22]If I have the shovel in my hands.
[242:32.50]Nope.
[242:32.74]Okay, perfect.
[242:35.86]Apparently this detective would carry around a shovel all the time.
[242:38.56]Because usually they'd be really mad about this, wouldn't they?
[242:41.75]Ah, Mr. Falcone.
[242:43.99]Looking slightly out of place.
[242:46.49]Yeah, slightly out of place.
[242:47.61]You don't usually carry a shovel with you, but okay.
[242:50.89]This is all too public for my tastes.
[242:55.57]Let's go.
[243:02.09]No big deal.
[243:02.71]I got you.
[243:05.13]Shutting down this freak show.
[243:09.76]Don't you know I'm a detective by day and an archaeologist by night?
[243:14.68]It's getting to be, like, dusk, so, you know, about to go pick up some dinosaurs.
[243:18.56]Hey, do you know the T-Rex had little arms?
[243:21.89]You know he was 50 feet tall?
[243:24.75]Did you know that the T-Rex was also known for killing other prey?
[243:37.55]Entering the ether lab requires a key card and a uniform.
[243:41.05]Luckily, it seems both are within reach.
[243:43.82]Oh, shit.
[243:44.84]Target down.
[243:46.30]Next up, Silvio Caruso.
[243:48.04]Lab coat?
[243:48.58]No, I can't take that lab coat.
[243:49.94]Come here.
[243:54.75]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[243:56.47]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[244:00.65]Into the dumpster.
[244:07.05]That was fun.
[244:07.78]It's my shovel.
[244:13.60]I need a lab coat.
[244:17.86]Where's the lab coat?
[244:24.53]I have a key card now.
[244:33.03]Is this a secret entrance?
[244:40.51]Does she have the coat?
[244:42.83]Can I get it from her?
[244:47.39]It didn't give me an option when I was there.
[244:48.63]Uh-oh.
[244:49.85]Uh-oh.
[244:51.93]Uh-oh.
[244:54.17]Is it in?
[244:54.91]I have no idea where I'm going now.
[244:57.54]There's no more thing on the mini-map.
[245:01.02]Save it.
[245:05.06]They're looking for her.
[245:06.84]They're calling her name out.
[245:17.59]I guess I... I gotta get through that fucking Dark Souls wall.
[245:22.62]Do I have a bomb or anything?
[245:24.52]No, I can't get through it.
[245:28.18]What?
[245:28.34]It told me that one was in reach.
[245:32.18]I don't see one and I couldn't take it from her.
[245:38.23]Well... Okay.
[245:41.55]Okay.
[245:45.77]Hopefully I'm not... I didn't miss something there, because... Alright, where's this random... Where's the lab?
[245:55.39]I have a keycard now.
[245:58.39]Is there not anything for me to track?
[246:00.46]DNA virus... Alright, I get to go in here?
[246:11.56]Bio lab keycard.
[246:12.44]Well, where's the bio lab?
[246:18.47]Is it down there?
[246:21.95]Apparently.
[246:22.35]I'm gonna see what I can do.
[246:23.81]Can I go through this?
[246:24.73]No, it's locked.
[246:25.49]Shit.
[246:27.98]Battleaxe is in the stone tower on wooden beam.
[246:30.52]The staircase.
[246:31.22]Stone tower.
[246:32.70]Okay.
[246:32.92]Well, I'll have to look at that later.
[246:41.49]I gotta get through here.
[246:46.69]Jerma doesn't read chat.
[246:48.01]I read chat.
[246:50.41]I'm a chat reader.
[246:51.13]I believe I'm going the wrong way right now.
[247:08.29]What's in here?
[247:09.47]Keycard?
[247:09.87]No.
[247:14.14]It's like on the other side.
[247:20.78]I can't smash the fucking window here.
[247:24.18]Oh my god, there's so many guards right there just watching me do that.
[247:33.92]I'm like kind of all the way back here.
[247:35.66]I need to... I need to go into my map.
[247:42.01]Alright, where... Level 2, level 3...
[247:51.22]objective.
[247:51.92]I gotta go here.
[247:54.82]So I gotta go up and around and then through here?
[247:58.08]How the fuck do I even get back there?
[248:00.93]I gotta turn around and go back this way.
[248:02.73]It seems.
[248:05.77]Did that guard just hit on you?
[248:08.25]I have no idea.
[248:12.49]I can't even sneak through this?
[248:14.55]What a pain in the ass.
[248:19.81]Have I been down here yet?
[248:20.79]I think so.
[248:21.23]Yeah, this is where I walked with her.
[248:22.27]Alright.
[248:27.21]Okay, I think I'm on the right track.
[248:28.97]So now I go from here down... Do I just bang a right through there?
[248:40.26]Like over here?
[248:41.86]Then I should be able to walk upstairs, right?
[248:46.81]Because this is putting me...
[248:50.39]Not really in the right direction, but... Let me just get back up to, like, level ground.
[248:54.83]It's a stone tower that stands out.
[248:57.96]Also, there's a circum... The circumtion knife?
[249:02.00]Yep.
[249:02.32]The one for... Oh, God.
[249:03.54]Okay, I said that word wrong.
[249:05.01]Fight it by a freaking plague doctor's outfit inside of the main dude.
[249:08.23]Alright.
[249:08.65]Well, thanks for the 1500, dude.
[249:09.39]Alright, I'm back up here.
[249:10.37]Let me actually figure out where the hell I'm going.
[249:13.15]Up there?
[249:13.57]Looks like it.
[249:16.25]He seems immersed.
[249:17.29]I don't know what's going on here.
[249:18.81]I haven't like murdered a random person in like 10 minutes.
[249:21.45]Something's really wrong.
[249:25.81]Here we go.
[249:26.81]Alright.
[249:28.06]Now I should... Can I like go... No, I was already up here.
[249:34.10]Fuck!
[249:34.40]I'm like walking in circles.
[249:39.60]I'm gonna go all the way around.
[249:46.38]I feel like I'm playing Dark Souls.
[249:47.72]This is like a non-linear level.
[249:49.68]There's a bunch of places to go.
[249:51.26]Where's my leg?
[249:51.94]Never mind, hold on.
[249:54.72]It's about to kill that guy.
[249:59.43]That would've been a huge mistake.
[250:04.73]Finally!
[250:05.43]Alright, I think I'm going the right way.
[250:08.13]I think.
[250:12.19]Give me the delegates.
[250:14.13]Go to the tower.
[250:16.03]Opportunity.
[250:17.85]Where is it?
[250:26.94]You'll be late for your first day of work.
[250:29.08]Relax.
[250:30.10]It's all good.
[250:30.80]Who's he talking to?
[250:32.86]Don't give me that grief, Rocco.
[250:35.04]Just get your pants on and act like a big boy, or you can get us both into trouble with Chef Marcello.
[250:40.26]Oh, please.
[250:41.82]Like, you want to wait on that weirdo Caruso for the rest of your life?
[250:44.54]It's not him talking.
[250:46.02]Come on.
[250:46.34]You gotta think big, sis.
[250:49.08]Yes, man.
[250:50.30]All this here is just temporary.
[250:52.76]Who the fuck is talking?
[250:54.06]That weirdo happens to be our boss.
[250:57.74]Chef Marcello Ray has hired a new kitchen hand by recommendation.
[251:02.32]And the two have yet to meet.
[251:04.30]She's talking to an invisible person.
[251:07.73]FYI, according to our research, Chef Marcello has been trying to replicate Isabella Caruso's famous home cooking.
[251:15.05]But Silvio Caruso is not impressed.
[251:18.33]I suggest you give him a helping hand.
[251:23.70]Oh, he's... I thought it was an invisible guy.
[251:28.68]Hey, get down here, man.
[251:30.88]You're late for work.
[251:32.26]No, I got bigger fish to fry.
[251:35.68]Sorry, guys.
[251:36.24]I don't care about this one.
[251:39.28]We need to get down here.
[251:40.32]So if I go straight, can I walk through here?
[251:45.53]Fuck, she just opened it.
[251:47.80]Ah!
[251:48.88]Come open the door again.
[251:54.64]Open it.
[251:55.78]Thank you.
[251:57.22]That's okay.
[251:59.16]Now get out of the way.
[252:01.52]I fucking told you to get out of the way.
[252:03.58]I tried to get you to get out of the way.
[252:05.75]That was your own fault.
[252:10.81]Didn't want to do that.
[252:12.25]I really didn't.
[252:16.01]Okay, I think I found a shortcut.
[252:20.69]Right around here.
[252:23.33]I gotta save this.
[252:23.91]Duh!
[252:36.46]I need a new disguise.
[252:37.56]I don't want to be this stupid archaeologist anymore.
[252:39.54]I can't blend in as a gardener.
[252:44.10]I have like a fanny pack.
[252:46.38]Alright, I need... Oh, yeah, I can.
[252:49.18]I can blend in as a gardener.
[252:54.35]And I got my shovel, too, so it makes perfect sense.
[253:01.65]I can be the gardener now.
[253:05.77]My disguise makes sense.
[253:07.79]I gotta go in... No, I don't wanna go in there.
[253:09.31]I wanna go over this way.
[253:14.59]Um... Straight through, maybe?
[253:25.05]I have the key card, so I just get in here and go down.
[253:29.00]The garden is not going to be allowed to go in here, guaranteed.
[253:32.96]Yeah, sorry, man.
[253:34.72]Yeah, you can't go in here.
[253:36.34]Sorry.
[253:36.76]Have a great day, sir.
[253:39.74]Should have kept on the other disguise.
[253:43.93]Did the camera see me kill that guy?
[253:45.07]Probably.
[253:47.17]Oh, you guys have terrible security.
[253:48.97]No, no, you can't go in this way.
[253:51.05]Every window is open.
[253:53.83]Sorry about that.
[253:54.85]You know, it gets a little too stuffy in here.
[253:56.87]Son of a... Gee, I didn't feel good about that one, but you know she's going to tell on me.
[254:11.82]I've got to get this gardener costume off.
[254:15.80]Shit, there's too many cleaning people.
[254:17.06]I don't want to... Oh, my God.
[254:19.07]No.
[254:19.57]No.
[254:36.69]Nobody's looking at me.
[254:40.89]Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
[254:44.87]Go check her out.
[254:46.13]Command, be advised we have a casualty.
[254:48.37]Stay alert.
[255:04.70]I got it.
[255:11.45]Okay, I'm good.
[255:18.23]Alright, save it.
[255:27.30]Now I'm good.
[255:28.66]Where's the laboratory?
[255:31.28]That's all I gotta find.
[255:32.36]This way?
[255:37.54]Hello.
[255:42.16]Alright, the target's downstairs.
[255:44.60]The DNA shit is downstairs.
[255:46.98]I need to find a way to get down.
[255:50.96]I love how nobody cares about the shovel.
[255:52.31]It's so perfect.
[255:56.31]Where is the way to get down?
[256:00.91]I guess we'll go up first.
[256:03.29]Oh, I thought that was the key card thing.
[256:06.43]Everything quiet on your front?
[256:10.72]It wants me so badly to get a kitchen staff disguise, and I'm just not doing that.
[256:18.71]Somebody is looking.
[256:19.39]I gotta get down the stairs.
[256:24.39]The stairs are right here, but how do I get all the way down?
[256:27.70]Am I in the wrong building?
[256:48.23]Anybody see that?
[256:51.25]Nope.
[256:53.19]Body found.
[256:53.83]Whoa, who found it?
[256:55.69]Oh, they're talking about downstairs.
[256:56.82]Easy, who cares?
[257:01.60]Get a keycard on you?
[257:02.38]No.
[257:04.24]This is somebody's bedroom.
[257:13.17]TV.
[257:13.41]TV.
[257:17.15]Wait, what?
[257:18.95]Somebody down here?
[257:21.65]Who's this?
[257:24.34]Oh, wow.
[257:25.02]That's too bad.
[257:25.54]I could have fucking shoveled him.
[257:28.36]I could have shoveled him from up here.
[257:30.58]He's going to go back out there, right?
[257:37.00]Please stop snapping necks.
[257:40.18]The final shovel throw of the evening is going to be this one for $1,000.
[257:48.87]Walk out the door, man.
[257:50.22]Come on.
[257:50.54]You're just going to stand there, aren't you?
[257:59.24]Though that's not going to kill him, is it?
[258:00.38]Can I jump down?
[258:04.41]No vaulting.
[258:07.97]Damn it.
[258:08.55]Well, I've got to go downstairs.
[258:10.09]Let me change the intel.
[258:11.97]Because... Opportunities.

[258:38.90]Back down to ground level.
[258:44.31]What are you doing?
[258:45.69]I'm trying to find how to get down to the underground lab.
[258:56.54]I don't know where it is.
[258:57.26]It's like down, it's down, it's right down there.

[264:51.85]So I need to get another disguise when I get down here.
[264:54.11]I can't be one of these guys.
[264:58.63]That's a brain concussion.

[265:23.35]That guy's going to be by himself, I think.
[265:25.17]Somebody's in the shower.
[265:25.87]Someone should go see what the hell that was.
[265:30.89]Just a sec.
[265:31.37]That's why we keep it safe.
[265:32.77]True.
[265:42.96]I can't believe I actually got it It's too much fun It really is

[267:08.27]And what the hell was up with that man?
[267:11.24]Thank you for your cooperation.
[267:12.34]You're very helpful.
[267:13.28]You better start concentrating on what's going on around here.
[267:19.34]He's hiding.
[267:21.10]What was up with that hazmat suit?
[267:23.22]Don't move.
[267:25.16]He's trying to hide.
[267:27.07]Hey, hold there.
[267:28.43]What was up with that hazmat suit?
[267:32.71]There he is, in there.
[267:35.87]Nobody saw me come in here.
[267:36.67]That would be fucking stupid.
[267:38.25]Fuck that.
[267:38.81]That's some bullshit.
[267:42.61]I don't know.
[267:45.78]He was like six feet tall.
[267:48.00]What the hell was up with that hazmat suit?
[267:55.49]That's so funny.
[268:00.43]Alright, let's go.
[268:02.21]No more.
[268:02.87]No more dumb shit.
[268:04.13]I know I've said that a thousand times, but just get- drop the shovel.
[268:07.63]We don't need it.
[268:09.82]We're not gonna be this idiot anymore.
[268:11.36]We're gonna actually play.
[268:12.22]Let's go.
[268:12.70]Come on.

[268:22.58]Uh, we got stuff to look at over here.
[268:24.54]Over here.
[268:33.47]What's up with that hazmat suit?
[268:36.95]God, that's fucking hilarious.
[268:38.19]Somebody's right there.
[268:39.33]I wish this guy would get the hell away from me.
[268:46.83]He's looking at me right now.
[268:47.69]Get out of here, man.
[268:49.21]Go do something else.
[268:49.85]Alright, is there something I can take in here?
[269:02.28]Somebody's already looking at me.
[269:04.98]Great.
[269:05.30]Now, is there... There's a person here that can see through my disguise, but I wonder if there's... Let's just blend in for a second while I get my bearings.
[269:18.00]Alright.
[269:21.29]What's in there?
[269:21.93]Watch that girl is looking at something else.
[269:23.85]Okay, this way.
[269:32.34]Here we go.
[269:32.84]Hazmat suits.
[269:35.26]Anybody looking?
[269:37.38]Biolab keycard.
[269:39.64]And a hazmat suit.
[269:42.74]Beautiful.
[269:44.49]Now let's sabotage this whole place.
[269:48.05]Save it.
[269:54.91]Okay.
[269:57.63]They're coming in.
[270:01.74]Everything is looking stable.
[270:08.36]Am I just going to go in here?
[270:10.15]Let's see where the vial thing is, right?
[270:12.17]Perfect.
[270:12.97]Do I have, like, a grenade?
[270:15.23]Can I just throw a grenade at it?
[270:16.57]What do I do?
[270:17.07]Uh...
[270:32.36]Good.
[270:33.52]Progressing to phase three.
[270:39.56]Hey, don't do that.
[270:41.04]Someone could get hurt.
[270:42.86]We are doing good.
[270:53.69]What?
[270:55.11]Look over there.
[270:56.15]Yeah, okay.

[297:38.94]That guy's gonna see me do this.
[297:45.30]Right?
[297:45.52]I mean, who would not be able to see me doing that?
[297:57.00]Well, let's give it a try.
[298:07.05]How do I keep getting work as a hitman?
[298:08.77]That's a good question.
[298:14.84]Hey, did you see that dude crawling on the side?
[298:16.66]Yeah, I did.
[298:17.30]Huh?
[298:22.42]I have to pull up here.
[298:27.55]He's just gonna see me.
[298:28.21]I thought I was gonna be able to go all the way.
[298:33.53]Wait, his back is turned.
[298:36.27]Is there another spot I can do this on?
[298:40.39]Okie dokie, okie dokie, okie dokie, okie dokie.
[298:44.12]Excuse you.
[298:45.24]Okay.
[298:45.40]In the clear.
[298:45.90]Uh.
[299:05.56]Pick up cannonball?
[299:09.88]Cannonball?
[299:13.08]Save it.
[299:20.80]Alright, where's this battle axe that I keep hearing about?
[299:28.26]Where is it hidden?
[299:30.23]Not that way.
[299:36.48]Let's go all the way to the top.
[299:43.74]This is gonna hurt.
[299:49.41]Jesus.
[299:51.27]I can't imagine getting hit in the fucking head with a cannonball.
[299:59.37]I think I'm gonna need to lose the shotgun too.
[300:02.83]It's probably gonna be a problem.
[300:08.13]Shoot the cannon.
[300:08.85]Can I shoot the fucking cannon?
[300:14.19]Oh boy.
[300:17.24]How do I load the cannon?
[300:20.96]You can't be serious.
[300:24.98]Who can I shoot with the cannon?
[300:28.66]Not loaded.
[300:29.14]I just loaded it.
[300:33.31]I just loaded it.
[300:36.04]Not loaded.
[300:37.06]You guys just saw me put that in there.
[300:39.16]You need more than one?
[300:39.88]There's another one.
[300:52.22]Load cannon.
[300:53.80]Load gunpowder.
[300:54.72]I'm missing gunpowder.
[300:57.36]Oh, well, that's just great.
[301:03.19]Is there gunpowder, like, hidden in the tower?
[301:05.88]Gunpowder.
[301:08.90]Mm-hmm.
[301:13.20]Okay.
[301:15.66]Who am I going to shoot with this?
[301:20.67]Why would I do this?
[301:26.29]Somebody probably has a meeting on the pier.
[301:44.99]Alright.
[301:46.97]Cool.
[301:49.95]Okay, that was fun.
[301:52.41]I'm glad I did that.
[301:53.35]Now, where's the battle axe?
[301:57.93]Whoa, another cannon.
[301:59.45]Ooh, okay.
[302:05.85]New cannon.
[302:13.97]He's playing golf, right?
[302:16.07]Can't wait to shoot this guy with a cannon.
[302:22.08]Can I pull it out?
[302:24.78]No, fuck it.
[302:25.60]I have another cannonball.
[302:26.40]Give me this.
[302:31.78]This is gonna be insane.
[302:32.86]Hooray.
[302:33.19]Is he still out there?
[302:38.65]There he is, playing golf.
[302:41.37]Yeah, work on your swing, buddy.
[302:44.91]You're about to have a real bad day.
[302:52.51]Here we go.
[302:53.21]Use cannon.
[302:56.09]Let me save this.
[303:01.92]Let's get him.
[303:05.38]Alright.
[303:06.78]Yeah, work on your backstroke.
[303:08.34]I'm gonna wait till he actually swings.
[303:16.39]And... This is the last thing you remember.
[303:20.35]Ah, you sliced it.
[303:24.80]Got him.
[303:28.96]Time to go.
[303:30.92]Holy shit, I'm right there.
[303:32.98]Alright, so where's this battle axe that I keep hearing about?
[303:39.11]It's on some staircase?
[303:42.50]Is it inside the tower?
[303:43.28]Did I miss it?
[303:43.82]No, it's up here.
[303:44.76]Let's try it.
[303:45.06]Let's try to battleaxe these guys.
[303:46.26]Wherever it may be.
[303:47.16]This is such a wild goose chase.
[304:11.32]Being hunted.
[304:12.30]Well, now the hunter becomes the hunted.
[304:17.03]Move in.
[304:17.97]Nice and easy.
[304:18.55]Are you serious?
[304:22.03]Okay.
[304:22.93]Where's the battle axe?
[304:28.93]Did I miss it?
[304:30.43]Wait, what?
[304:35.49]Was it just on the staircase?
[304:36.51]Did I run by it?
[304:38.95]Or am I just blind?
[304:42.73]Of course he is.
[304:43.19]Stupid.
[304:43.33]He's aiming for the head, of course he is.
[304:45.93]There it is.
[304:47.65]Right when I knock it down, are you serious?
[305:14.95]Anybody else?
[305:15.39]I don't think so.
[305:17.17]Watch out!
[305:17.51]He's aiming for the head!
[305:22.52]Battle Axe.
[305:23.04]Where did it drop?
[305:26.90]Oh boy.
[305:27.50]Alright.
[305:30.46]I got it.
[305:31.54]Boys and girls, got the Battle Axe.
[305:34.96]Yeah, good thing you have the Battle Axe.
[305:36.46]Good thing you used it.
[305:37.58]I wanted to Battle Axe this guy.
[305:52.37]I can't have this anymore, can I?
[305:53.73]I need to get one person with it.
[305:55.85]Before I just go to the exit, which is right here.
[305:57.51]Any more guards?
[306:03.53]There's a naked guy.
[306:07.17]The exit is right underneath me.
[306:12.52]Well, let's give it a go this way.
[306:14.22]There we go.
[306:15.90]Perfect.
[306:16.22]This guy has no fucking idea.
[306:22.53]And... Battleaxe?
[306:27.67]Oh, God.
[306:31.85]That was heinous.
[306:32.61]Alright, who else can I Battleaxe?
[306:37.63]I want a full-on in the head.
[306:39.41]Come up here.
[306:43.52]Crime noticed.
[306:45.94]Oh, that's a gardener.
[306:47.72]It's just a gardener.
[306:50.40]Yeah, I'm a little bit faster than you.
[306:53.24]And I've got something from the medieval times.
[306:58.80]It's kind of just a fire axe with a different skin, if I'm honest.
[307:02.94]Oh, well.
[307:05.88]Wait, I think I have to go down.
[307:12.34]It says illegal item.
[307:14.99]Ah, that's illegal.
[307:18.53]Where is the exit?
[307:20.99]Is it where I came in the original time?
[307:30.70]Let's try a throw.
[307:32.10]Fucking wonderful.
[307:32.96]That was great.
[307:34.26]That's just great.
[307:35.72]Again, that sounded like somebody was going to call.
[307:37.28]What the?
[307:45.21]Okay, that was terrible.
[307:46.45]A little bit closer.
[307:47.25]A little bit closer.
[307:48.75]Where was my... Where was my circle on his head?
[308:16.07]Where was it?
[308:18.43]Did I save anything?
[308:19.39]Or am I back at the fucking... Of course, I'm back at the cannon.
[308:22.96]Alright, cool.
[308:23.50]Battleaxe was fun.
[308:24.62]Now I gotta blow him up and get out of here.
[308:32.44]Who did this?
[308:39.23]Oh no!
[308:39.75]What happened?
[308:40.21]There's a guy that's gonna shoot us!
[308:46.47]Get me out of here.
[308:49.61]I just want to get to the fucking exit.
[309:00.77]Get me out of here.
[309:02.90]I just want to go home.
[309:04.64]I just want to shoot the fucking guy and go home.
[309:08.70]But I don't know where the exit even is.
[309:11.90]It's like underneath me.
[309:18.85]Let me just take a look at the map and see where the hell I even need to go.
[309:23.61]Use the cannon and then look at the map.
[309:27.00]Okay.
[309:27.94]You got him.
[309:29.54]Locate the exit.
[309:31.40]Where is it?
[309:31.74]It's like right here?
[309:34.30]I just have to get out of the tower and go all the way around to the other side.
[309:39.13]What a crock of shit.
[309:42.85]Wait, no, no, no.
[309:43.35]That wasn't even right.
[309:52.45]I guess that... Is the bio lab place the exit?
[309:57.97]Do I have to go back in the lab?
[309:59.23]I have no fucking idea.
[310:10.56]I don't know.
[310:12.68]But I'm gonna shoot my way out of here.
[310:16.34]Oh my god, I'm glad to see you.
[310:18.58]Yeah, look.
[310:19.08]It's, like, right here.
[310:20.36]There's just a boat down there.
[310:22.52]Alright, well, let's just get out of there.
[310:24.92]Let's get out of there.
[310:26.49]Wait, what was that?
[310:51.91]It's a joint?
[310:52.51]Can I smoke this?
[310:56.65]What?
[310:58.23]Okay.
[311:00.71]Alright.
[311:03.04]Can I kill somebody with cannabis?
[311:07.98]That's it.
[311:08.88]I win.
[311:17.61]Get faked.
[311:26.03]Alright.
[311:26.83]I think I'm gonna call it here.
[311:33.71]Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[311:35.69]I do want to say, there's a lot of people that subbed.
[311:38.28]Look at this!
[311:38.62]Look at all these points!
[311:40.42]Oh, he's gonna get zero points!
[311:41.72]Look at all these things I did.
[311:44.84]Look at all these achievements.
[311:45.66]Look at all these points.
[311:52.08]Let's take a look at the scorecard.
[311:56.20]okay how'd I do alright plus 30 zero never spotted no notice skills no bodies no recordings non-target kill penalty 41 times okay so for future reference for for the future don't snap everybody's neck you don't have to do that apparently
[312:26.06]If I didn't snap 40 people's necks, I think I would have been okay.
[312:32.86]I would have had at least two points.
[312:37.55]And anyways, I'm actually having a lot of fun with this, so we'll absolutely finish it.
[312:43.95]I don't have a planned stream tomorrow, but I might still.
[312:47.91]It took you an hour.
[312:49.35]Well, let's be fair.
[312:50.53]I was like fucking around for at least half that time.
[312:54.95]I wasn't like seriously... Oh god, I'm hitting things.
[312:58.22]I wasn't seriously playing the mission for at least 30 or 40 minutes.
[313:02.03]I was just having some fun.
[313:04.89]That's my excuse.
[313:07.04]Time rewinded.
[313:10.48]No, this game's fun.
