[00:10.01]I swear to God.
[00:12.75]There better be 1900 people here right now.
[00:18.57]Okay.
[00:20.71]Okay.
[00:22.40]Wait a minute.
[00:22.86]Oh, the microphone.
[00:24.16]It's out of sync.
[00:25.28]It's out of sync.
[00:25.90]You're gonna have to deal with it.
[00:27.18]Hey.
[00:27.82]Hey.
[00:28.14]Don't even worry.
[00:28.78]Hey.
[00:29.04]Don't even worry about it.
[00:29.80]Out of sync.
[00:30.22]Who cares, right?
[00:31.68]It has to be out of sync because it has to match up with the fucking Elgato game capture.
[00:34.60]Game capture.
[00:35.21]Listen to me.
[00:37.17]Army of two.
[00:37.93]There it is.
[00:38.99]Here's your joke for the evening.
[00:41.32]He's gonna break it in half!
[01:03.39]I'm going to say, oh, did you hear that one?
[01:06.29]Crushed it.
[01:07.23]That's it.
[01:08.97]Get it fucking crushed.
[01:12.37]Crushed it.
[01:15.90]Didn't see that on camera, did you?
[01:17.60]But I crushed it.
[01:35.61]Come on, I typed it.
[01:37.34]Look at the view count.
[01:38.22]Look at the view count.
[01:38.86]This is what I fucking told you was going to happen.
[01:40.64]Nobody believes me.
[01:41.66]A fucking thousand people left the stream.
[01:44.14]A thousand people left.
[01:46.42]Like, this is what happens when you fucking have a shitty stream and you have to turn your fucking stream off because your Windows 10 don't work and your OBS fucking goes whoop-de-doodle.
[01:55.60]Anyways.
[01:55.88]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[01:57.62]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:58.30]Give me a minute.
[01:58.70]Give me a minute.
[02:00.97]Fucking Garfield.
[02:05.44]Alright, let's see who, uh, who was that?
[02:08.38]I need my OBS to work again.
[02:10.30]Hopefully it's not going to break.
[02:11.55]There's a new version of game capture software.
[02:13.65]Get out of here.
[02:14.59]I don't, how dare you?
[02:16.95]Don't you see I'm streaming?
[02:17.67]They did that because I was streaming.
[02:19.53]They knew I was streaming.
[02:22.53]Anyways, thank you so much to, holy shit, dude, really?
[02:30.18]Cigarette Spaghetti gave fucking a lot of money.
[02:33.30]Let me see this.
[02:37.40]Cigarette Spaghetti gave like $200, by the way.
[02:41.30]He gave $180.
[02:42.40]So let's talk about this.
[02:44.80]$100 to actually break your army of two discs in half on camera.
[02:48.40]Fuck.
[02:49.50]I feel like Jerm is pulling some crazy bamboozle.
[02:53.02]For $200, fine.
[02:54.58]I'll break it on stream.
[02:56.12]Fine.
[02:58.06]Cigarette Spaghetti, thank you for the fucking $200, dude.
[03:02.24]Don't do Rumble on Thursday.
[03:03.56]It's not going to be on Thursday.
[03:04.44]It'll be on Friday, if anything.
[03:05.62]But thank you so much, man.
[03:07.69]Alright, I'll break it on screen.
[03:08.69]You want to see it?
[03:09.27]You want to see that happen on fucking live on camera?
[03:11.63]I'll give it to you.
[03:12.82]It's not on, right?
[03:13.38]I'm in my underwear.
[03:14.00]Hold on.
[03:17.86]Here we go.
[03:19.74]Ready to see a fucking man, a man that can like break shit?
[03:23.36]Don't try this at home.
[03:25.56]Very important.
[03:26.18]Don't try this shit at home.
[03:28.67]You got to get it in like the right spot.
[03:32.07]Okay.
[03:33.43]Don't try this shit at home.
[03:34.43]This is, don't try this at home.
[03:35.77]This is fucking dangerous.
[03:48.41]There it is.
[03:49.47]Fucking broken.
[03:50.07]There you go.
[03:52.70]Now we go the other way.
[03:53.58]Now we go the other way.
[03:56.28]There it is.
[04:02.97]A clean break.
[04:04.67]A clean break.
[04:05.63]You ever seen anybody do that before?
[04:06.79]Clean break.
[04:10.20]Don't do that at your house.
[04:11.50]Don't do that in front of your fucking parents.
[04:13.40]Don't do that in front of your friends.
[04:15.26]Fucking dangerous.
[04:16.66]Don't do that at home.
[04:18.32]I'm a professionally trained fucking moron.
[04:20.30]Don't do that at home.
[04:25.46]The delay is so bad.
[04:26.34]I know because the delay has to be bad because it has to catch up to this because I didn't set it because I didn't think I was going to have a webcam.
[04:31.86]That was a clean, that was a fucking $200 break is what that was.
[04:35.23]Thank you, man.
[04:45.78]It didn't break on camera.
[04:47.54]What?
[04:50.59]Wait, you like my shirt?
[04:52.57]It's a good shirt.
[04:53.31]What's wrong with my fucking shirt?
[04:56.41]Let's play, we're on twitch.tv.
[04:58.25]Like what the fuck are we doing?
[05:00.25]Let's play the game.
[05:06.69]I can turn this off now.
[05:07.87]Put this back to zero.
[05:14.05]You don't like my shirt?
[05:15.47]You don't like my shirt?
[05:16.17]Then get the fuck out of here.
[05:20.42]So many people left.
[05:21.40]I told you this is what happens.
[05:23.40]Nobody believed me.
[05:26.18]Nobody believed me.
[05:26.92]Like if you turn your stream off for fucking five seconds, it's like popcorn.
[05:32.38]You know what I mean?
[05:32.80]Like it's twitch.tv.
[05:33.50]It's popcorn.
[05:35.22]This stream just turned off.
[05:36.48]I'm going to go watch this guy.
[05:38.72]Popcorn.
[05:39.42]It's a popcorn stream.
[05:49.78]$200 to break your t-shirt.
[05:50.86]No.
[05:52.56]It's gonna be more than that.
[05:53.34]Alright, how we doing?
[05:55.02]The last time I like rage quit this game.
[05:58.94]Thank you, Garrett, for the bits.
[06:00.02]Jeremiah, I love you and I'm definitely gonna break roughly 45 CDs in front of you.
[06:03.24]Don't break CDs in front of your friends.
[06:05.24]You know why that's dangerous?
[06:06.92]Let me show you real quick.
[06:08.16]This is why this is fucking dangerous.
[06:10.48]Look at this.
[06:10.86]Okay, so ready?
[06:12.35]Don't look at my hair.
[06:13.19]It's not good today.
[06:14.65]I don't like it today.
[06:16.65]Like when you bend a CD in half, right?
[06:20.49]Give me a second.
[06:20.99]I gotta fucking... Hold on a second.
[06:27.28]I got... Hold on.
[06:33.24]There we go.
[06:34.60]That's better.
[06:35.44]That should be better.
[06:37.40]Are we better?
[06:39.66]No, we're definitely not better.
[06:41.70]You know, who cares?
[06:43.16]Alright, look, ready?
[06:44.38]When you bend the CD in half and it breaks, the part that breaks shoots out like spikes and can stick into your hand and cause fucking severe damage.
[06:53.83]I'm not going to be responsible for severe damage that you do to your own body.
[06:56.91]Absolutely not.
[06:57.57]Do not do that.
[06:58.61]Dispose of it in a recycling bin where it belongs.
[07:01.49]And that gets sent to a recycling treatment plant and it turns into a bottle of water that you then drink out of.
[07:08.04]Fucking assholes.
[07:15.64]Alright, let's go.
[07:17.87]The last time I rage quit this game is because I had to pick up flowers.
[07:22.03]So let's, like, go pick up flowers.
[07:24.19]I can't jump over this, apparently.
[07:25.69]I don't know why.
[07:28.98]Can jump over this.
[07:29.68]Alright, let's get a... What do I have?
[07:30.78]A new horse?
[07:33.00]The safety string.
[07:35.29]So I have to go, from my understanding, I need to go up here, and I need to go over here.
[07:42.27]So we're over here, we're in tall trees, let's go to tall trees and look for fucking flowers.
[07:49.19]I think you guys ready for a fucking extraordinary stream?
[07:52.07]You thought that the Etalyx joke dragged on for too long?
[07:54.83]We're gonna be talking about flowers for like 45 minutes.
[08:10.45]flower stream pretty much that's the fetch flower quest so I'm going I'm going to tall trees which is it's this is the correct place to go right and then I have to go down into like Mexico right wearing the right t-shirt for this fucking game I'll tell you that right now
[08:37.91]Could you guys see my, like, fucking lower body?
[08:39.91]When I had the camera on, I'm, like, freaking out right now.
[08:43.54]You couldn't see, like, my, like, penile area, right?
[08:45.40]Like, I hope not.
[08:52.22]Okay, let me remember how to play the game.
[08:53.38]That would be nice.
[08:57.23]Okay, if you could remember how to play the video game, Jeremy, that would be fantastic.
[09:00.25]There's a lot of people that left that you need to, like, impress.
[09:05.95]There's a shitload of people that left your stream that you need to impress.
[09:10.99]Why am I streaming my underwear?
[09:12.03]Because it's fucking hot in here.
[09:13.25]What is that?
[09:13.61]Is there a chest in here that I didn't get before?
[09:24.48]We could see it in the CD of reflection.
[09:30.46]How can you impress them if they're not here?
[09:32.04]Impress me.
[09:34.52]Hey, you gotta admit, I'm gonna give myself a little credit here.
[09:37.52]Like, sometimes you gotta, like, pat yourself on the back a little bit.
[09:39.58]Sometimes you gotta, like, fucking stroke your own ego.
[09:41.86]That italic soundboard Army of Two joke.
[09:46.75]Beautiful.
[09:47.35]If I say so myself.
[09:48.89]Fucking... You know what I'm saying?
[09:51.99]But you can't tell me that wasn't a fucking decent joke.
[09:53.81]Don't even dare tell me that.
[09:55.01]Because that was fucking a... joke.
[09:56.89]If you don't fucking agree with that, then you're a fucking... Okay, hold on.
[10:02.81]What?!
[10:03.05]I thought that was the horse!
[10:16.47]Okay, we good, we good.
[10:22.74]I thought that was the horse.
[10:25.00]Here comes the boss.
[10:29.07]Hummingbird Sage, that's not what I need.
[10:32.19]Fuck, what do I need?
[10:36.91]Get back here.
[10:39.71]You died again?
[10:42.28]I love how he just walked off screen.
[10:44.46]He did like a fucking Super Smash Brothers.
[10:46.02]What's that game?
[10:46.56]What's that game that you could go off one side of the screen and you end up on the other side of the screen?
[10:52.10]Bubble Bobble.
[10:52.86]No.
[10:53.52]Mega Man.
[10:54.00]No.
[10:54.32]Bubble Bobble.
[10:55.09]Right?
[10:55.53]Which one was it?
[10:57.21]What game was that?
[11:02.95]Watch out for the fucking Zumbinis.
[11:07.63]Pac-Man.
[11:08.09]That's the one.
[11:08.47]Pac-Man.
[11:09.05]Everybody loves Pac-Man.
[11:16.85]Oh, Pac-Man, let me tell ya.
[11:19.53]Didn't I already do this before?
[11:26.68]Oh yeah, when I played like Dark Souls.
[11:27.90]Alright, I'm looking for... Let me just make sure I'm doing the right thing here.
[11:36.36]We don't want to fuck this up.
[11:39.97]A cure for what ails you.
[11:42.83]Collects four desert sage and five violet snowdrop.
[11:46.59]Okay.
[11:48.01]We're in the fucking snow!
[11:51.29]If it's gonna be here, it's gonna be here.
[11:52.77]You know what I'm saying?
[11:53.35]We're in the snow.
[11:57.55]So where's the snowdrop?
[12:03.48]Like, what's the drop rate on this stuff?
[12:04.84]Is it like everywhere or what?
[12:12.63]Wait, wait, wait, what is that one?
[12:15.55]Snowdrop?
[12:16.47]Do we get our first snowdrop of the evening?
[12:19.23]Can I get the fuck out of this awful shit part of the game?
[12:23.34]Violent snowdrop!
[12:24.34]There it is!
[12:28.34]Don't worry guys, we only have to do that four more times.
[12:39.51]Violent snowdrop.
[12:41.15]What else do we need?
[12:44.40]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[12:45.94]There's another one right there, I think.
[12:49.64]Yes, there is.
[12:52.30]Violet Snowdrop.
[12:53.54]Hey, well, we're getting... Hey, hey, you don't... Hey.
[12:58.20]Can we just talk about the fucking execution of that Etalyx joke?
[13:04.59]Alright, now I'm in like a really weird mood.
[13:08.21]I don't know why.
[13:09.69]Don't ask me what the fuck is going on right now with my, like, brain.
[13:12.47]You know what it is?
[13:12.97]I worked up today.
[13:13.81]So, like, all the endorphins are, like, fucking taking over my body.
[13:16.29]And we're just getting, like, a jokey fucking weirdo Jeremy.
[13:30.20]Yeah.
[13:36.57]One Hit Wonder obsesses over his one-hit joke.
[13:43.22]Alright, honestly, okay, let me give you, like, a rating for Red Dead Redemption.
[13:46.68]Like, nearly a fucking, like, 9.8, right?
[13:52.37]Like, we're talking, like, Red Dead Redemption and its DLC.
[13:55.19]Like, a fucking 9.8.
[13:56.77]It was fucking fantastic.
[13:57.83]It was great.
[13:59.01]It was fun.
[13:59.53]It was funny.
[14:00.15]It was interesting.
[14:01.95]Get this fucking Warcraft shit out of here.
[14:03.69]Like, why do we have to do this?
[14:05.99]Who thought this was a good idea to procress the quarry?
[14:08.65]You know what I mean?
[14:09.69]Who thought it was a good idea to jump off the fucking quarry?
[14:11.51]That's never a good idea!
[14:12.53]You're gonna fucking break your neck!
[14:14.81]Where am I going?
[14:23.84]Cigarette spaghetti, thanks for the- Thanks for the- More money from cigarette spaghetti!
[14:28.93]Thank you for the $10, dude, and they say, can you tell us more of the story about when you served jury duty from JermaCraft Episode 7?
[14:36.26]No.
[14:37.50]I, you know, I can't fucking wait to, like, just stream one day and be playing Minecraft Vanilla.
[14:44.95]That's gonna be fucking hilarious.
[14:46.97]And I'm not gonna say shit.
[14:48.71]We're gonna build a regular dumb shit dirt house.
[14:52.87]And it's gonna be the worst stream I've ever done.
[14:54.37]But you guys have fucking made me do it.
[14:55.83]You guys have asked for it a hundred times.
[14:57.93]We're gonna play fucking Minecraft on stream.
[15:00.15]We're gonna do it.
[15:00.67]A fucking Vanilla Minecraft.
[15:01.86]That's it.
[15:03.90]And I'm gonna get a ton of complaints.
[15:06.32]People are gonna talk about, this sucks, Jerma.
[15:08.48]What the fuck?
[15:09.10]Your stream sucks.
[15:10.31]This is wicked boring.
[15:11.47]You suck.
[15:12.03]Fuck you for doing this.
[15:13.01]And I'm gonna be like, this is what you fucking asked for.
[15:14.57]And they can blame you guys in chat.
[15:22.44]This looks like the one.
[15:23.20]Yeah.
[15:29.18]I didn't ask you to play Minecraft.
[15:30.60]I just want to hear your jury duty story.
[15:37.12]I really just flew off the fucking handle.
[15:38.88]I just jumped way too far to conclusions there.
[15:42.69]He just wanted to have me answer a question.
[15:45.23]And I heard Minecraft and I lost my fucking shit.
[15:50.77]But thank you, Cigarette Spaghetti, for the now over $200 fucking dollars.
[15:57.19]I hope that's expendable money.
[15:59.25]Because that's a lot of fucking money to give somebody in one day.
[16:03.23]I just got like Minecraft triggered.
[16:04.89]It's true.
[16:05.37]And I don't even like to use that word because it's like you're triggered.
[16:08.09]I got this guy.
[16:08.63]I triggered him.
[16:10.22]Watch Jerma when I say he's 5'2".
[16:11.76]He's triggered.
[16:12.12]I ain't 5'2".
[16:39.66]Need one more.
[16:40.16]He triggered himself.
[16:46.86]The streamer yells at Donator.
[16:48.28]I just want- I'm trying to fucking make conversation so we can get out of this mission.
[16:51.46]There it is!
[16:52.48]And there she belongs!
[16:58.39]Like, shithair.
[17:01.79]We're not gonna- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17:03.83]Jury duty, jury duty.
[17:04.75]What do you want to know about jury duty?
[17:06.93]They sent us home!
[17:09.51]And that's it.
[17:10.25]I sat around and played on my iPad for like fucking four hours.
[17:14.17]And I went home.
[17:14.79]Because they didn't need us.
[17:17.05]You know how jury duty works?
[17:18.05]That you like sit around all day until they figure out if they need anybody.
[17:20.78]And then we just went home.
[17:23.42]It wasn't interesting.
[17:25.76]I didn't do anything.
[17:26.80]That was like 2011 Jeremy.
[17:29.38]When I was like, I have to talk about something.
[17:31.16]I have to talk about something.
[17:34.42]Jury duty.
[17:34.86]Oh, that's interesting.
[17:35.56]They'll think it's interesting and they'll listen to me.
[17:38.29]No, I just fucking sat around with my iPad.
[17:40.12]Or, like, my fucking iPod.
[17:41.10]I don't even know.
[17:41.94]What did I do?
[17:44.20]I didn't go, like, to trial.
[17:45.70]That would have been a much better story.
[17:46.94]That's a JermaCraft story.
[17:48.56]What a shit story.
[17:51.00]I should be put on trial for having a bad fucking story.
[17:57.14]We loved you in 2011.
[17:57.76]You know what?
[17:58.16]I liked myself in 2011.
[18:05.33]Now where are we going?
[18:07.22]Uh, Gaptooth Bridge, right?
[18:10.68]This is correct, I hope.
[18:12.26]Except I can't fast travel there.
[18:16.84]Jury duty is a weird thing, I know.
[18:18.16]And, like, look.
[18:19.07]You know, I lost, like, fucking 500 people on the stream already.
[18:21.99]Like, a self-conscious streamer talks while he, like, is self-conscious about losing hundreds of viewers.
[18:26.73]It's all good.
[18:28.35]Don't worry.
[18:30.48]Don't worry about it.
[18:31.08]It's alright.
[18:37.88]What the- what did- what did we- we walked over like a stump?
[18:43.11]What?
[18:44.25]What- what- what did- what did we- we- we fuckin' read?
[18:46.87]It was a fuckin' cougar.
[18:49.65]I thought it was a fuckin' stump!
[18:54.37]I thought it was a fuckin' stump!
[18:57.94]He tripped over a fuckin' stump and died!
[19:00.74]What?
[19:10.91]I'm trying to tell you guys I'm in like a bad place.
[19:19.66]Kim just like walked in here with Otto in her hands.
[19:22.56]I just turned around.
[19:23.20]There was a girl behind me with a dog.
[19:26.38]And then I turned back.
[19:27.76]Otto's in here now.
[19:29.22]He must have done something bad.
[19:32.08]Yep.
[19:33.06]Otto definitely like put his face in the trash.
[19:35.24]What did you do?
[19:37.62]What did you do to get in trouble?
[19:39.07]What happened?
[19:41.97]I think he got in trouble.
[19:42.72]I'll have to find out later.
[19:46.68]Actually, it's good that I died because... Wait a minute.
[19:51.50]Do not... Do not fucking tell me.
[20:11.96]Oh my fucking god.
[20:15.60]The whole fucking thing has to be done again.
[20:21.06]Save.
[20:21.46]I can't save.
[20:22.24]What do you mean save?
[20:23.39]I got attacked by... My horse tripped and fucking died.
[20:26.61]Oh my god.
[20:31.61]Un-fucking-believable.
[20:33.33]All because we're talking about, like, fucking jury duty.
[20:38.13]And here's... Ah.
[20:47.53]Talking about jury duty in Minecraft, and that's what got... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[20:50.92]That's not true.
[20:52.14]It was the dumb fucking cougar.
[20:53.28]My horse tripped and died.
[20:55.30]And then, like, I just was in the... We were still, for some reason, talking about jury duty.
[20:58.86]I have to do this all again.
[21:02.75]Oh, my whole body hurts.
[21:05.09]The fucking one mission that doesn't autosave that is like a fucking World of Warcraft herbalism mission.
[21:12.61]Ooh, Red Dead Redemption, you are a great game, but you are really trying me right now.
[21:17.75]You are trying me right now.
[21:21.25]You're making this... Making this not hard for me.
[21:24.75]To say that I'm not having a good time.
[21:30.09]No soundboard?
[21:30.75]No!
[21:31.07]That was like a 35 minute ordeal.
[21:33.15]No more soundboard.
[21:34.42]If you thought it was funny, if you didn't think it was funny, then I'm sorry.
[21:36.50]I'll try better.
[21:37.12]I'll try harder next time.
[21:42.48]If you didn't find my dumb antics funny, then that means I have to try harder next time.
[21:49.57]Try hard try a triggered Try hard triggered
[22:24.63]I'm just full of like- I'm full- Look guys, I'm just like full of endorphins right now.
[22:28.81]When you exercise, your body decides to pump you full of happy genes.
[22:36.82]And then you start saying weird shit.
[22:39.32]For instance.
[22:39.82]Yabba dabba doo.
[22:48.65]I'm very, I'm very sorry about that.
[22:50.29]That was not funny.
[22:51.05]That was very, like, lame and... Had no fucking... That was not a single 1% funny.
[22:58.52]And I'm fucking deeply sorry about that.
[23:04.87]I'll never forget that.
[23:08.45]Ever.
[23:14.78]Do not approach local... vocal... I can't even talk.
[23:18.50]Fucking... Alright, let's look.
[23:24.64]Thank you, Cigarette Spaghetti, for the money.
[23:26.89]For the lots of money.
[23:28.33]Ten bucks, to be exact, again.
[23:30.75]And they say do not approach local wildlife.
[23:32.39]This time, I have to get a better gun out here.
[23:36.55]Seriously.
[23:39.73]I ain't fucking around.
[23:40.55]If something attacks, I'm going instantly into Deadeye.
[23:48.66]I'm going to forget in like five minutes.
[23:49.90]Well, that's what happens when you're me.
[23:51.78]You just forget.
[23:53.94]Sometimes I forget things.
[24:00.32]And there it is.
[24:01.45]This time, don't fuck it up.
[24:04.91]How was the Vinny experience?
[24:05.85]Oh, if you didn't know, yeah, I was on the Vinesauce charity stream.
[24:11.87]I made a small appearance for like maybe 15, 20 minutes.
[24:15.15]It was just a small little thing that we decided we were gonna do because Vinny came on my stream.
[24:21.23]He was nice enough and, I guess, fun enough to...
[24:25.82]Do that.
[24:26.98]So I was like, fuck yeah.
[24:28.78]I'll come on your stream and we'll do a little bit.
[24:30.70]And we did.
[24:31.12]It was really, really fun.
[24:33.17]I didn't want to talk about it that much because I wanted it to be a surprise.
[24:37.23]I didn't want people to know exactly when I was going to be on.
[24:39.95]We did this thing where I got fucking thrown out of his house.
[24:43.34]I would rather it be a surprise than... Hey, I'm on Vinny's stream in five seconds.
[24:48.16]Bye.
[24:52.94]And they did a really good job.
[24:53.85]That was a very, very good cause.
[24:55.55]They knocked it out of the park.
[24:56.49]They're all good people.
[24:59.33]You should support the Vinesauce team for sure.
[25:05.51]And who knows?
[25:05.97]Maybe in the future, maybe me and Vinny will play something together.
[25:09.01]I don't know.
[25:09.99]I can't say that like, yeah, tomorrow me and Vinny are going to play Minecraft.
[25:14.38]That's not going to happen.
[25:15.68]Don't even fucking attempt to say that because that's never going to happen.
[25:18.16]So don't worry.
[25:18.98]I just saved you that breath.
[25:24.66]And we're doing the same, we're just doing the same exact shit we did like fucking 10 minutes ago.
[25:31.75]No, and don't, don't like, I know what's gonna happen.
[25:35.45]Now everybody's gonna fucking talk to Vinny about like Minecraft.
[25:38.23]Don't do that.
[25:39.49]Don't do that.
[25:40.17]Like, come on, as a fucking Jerma community, can we have a little bit of restraint?
[25:47.29]I'd rather you guys talk about how like small I am than talk to Vinny about playing Minecraft.
[25:55.76]The point is, they're good people.
[26:04.67]They made it very easy.
[26:06.69]It was not, like, weird, or... I mean, maybe I was a little weird.
[26:13.21]That's just the kind of person I am, I guess.
[26:17.62]You can't restrain the Jerma community.
[26:20.08]Of course I can.
[26:22.28]I can slash fucking ban.
[26:25.30]I can do a blanket ban.
[26:34.08]The short joke is fucking stupid.
[26:36.90]Okay, here's the thing about, like, meme-y jokes, right?
[26:40.52]Meme-y jokes, like, get funny.
[26:42.40]And then they get really funny.
[26:44.80]And then they get really, really funny.
[26:49.22]And they can really super laugh out loud funny.
[26:52.94]And then they get fall out of my chair, need to go to the hospital funny.
[26:58.40]And then they get like, it's the only thing that matters funny.
[27:04.16]And then it dies.
[27:07.70]And then it goes away.
[27:17.29]There we go.
[27:18.17]That's one.
[27:26.45]You're short on patience with jokes.
[27:28.03]Get him out of here.
[27:29.55]You know, get him the hell out of here.
[27:36.53]What state am I in?
[27:37.58]What state's the short Jerma?
[27:38.82]The short Jerma joke is like, oh my god, fucking roll.
[27:42.66]I am rolling right now.
[27:50.69]Can I please get this and get the fuck out of here?
[27:56.00]People still do short jokes from five years ago.
[28:00.85]It's never going to end.
[28:02.83]Guys, there are people that still want me to say shmee.
[28:04.59]You know what I mean?
[28:05.07]Like, that's just never going to go away.
[28:06.23]Hey, shmee, the pirate shmee.
[28:09.34]Like, I can't control that.
[28:11.38]And people get mad at me.
[28:13.16]People get angry with me over that joke.
[28:17.14]I've, like, read, like, Reddit threads where people talked about, like...
[28:20.57]Yeah, this guy, Jerma, like, he fucking ruined TF2 with, like, the shpee shit.
[28:24.19]Fuck this guy.
[28:24.91]It's like, I don't, I, I said, like, I said, like, a word four years ago.
[28:29.53]I'm sorry, I didn't, what do I do?
[28:34.36]What do you want me to do?
[28:35.06]You want to make, like, a public fucking YouTube video, like, denouncing shpee?
[28:39.26]Well, that would be fucking stupid.
[28:40.44]Hi, guys, yeah, Jeremy here, Jerma985 here.
[28:44.62]I just want to publicly come on the, on the television screen and denounce the use of the word shpee.
[28:50.29]I find it to be fucking abhorrent and terrible and anybody that uses it, I'll dare you.
[28:55.22]I wonder what he's supposed to do.
[28:57.72]That's a great idea.
[28:59.48]Alright, do I have all the ones I need?
[29:01.56]Okay.
[29:06.78]Now don't die from a fucking leopard.
[29:14.89]Get the fuck out of here.
[29:20.67]No way.
[29:23.11]I spawned him with my voice activation.
[29:29.84]We're gonna go here and I'm going to fast travel to Gap Bridge.
[29:38.97]Fuck off Garfield.
[29:44.21]Just go to the town and save.
[29:46.73]Just need to get to town.
[30:04.71]So you admit you spawned the bears and like there are people that thought like I did that on purpose.
[30:08.88]Like guys, I don't do anything on purpose.
[30:12.20]If you think I'm like fucking smart enough to do like half this shit on purpose, I got news for you.
[30:18.04]No.
[30:20.97]Yeah, I know that guy.
[30:21.91]That guy like knew what he was doing.
[30:23.27]He went to the same spot on that cliff.
[30:25.33]Guys, I can barely fucking remember how to press left bumper to shoot a person, let alone like stage an event.
[30:30.95]I don't stage anything.
[30:32.19]You think I stage shit?
[30:34.19]Ask Etalyx.
[30:34.89]He was on stream a few hours ago.
[30:51.66]You literally planned the Etalyx event.
[30:54.56]Yeah, but that's different though.
[30:56.64]That's not like a gameplay event.
[31:03.98]Cigarette spaghetti, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[31:05.76]Do you remember how hard am I going to have to cheer to coerce you into destroying your t-shirt?
[31:10.08]No, I like the way this t-shirt fits.
[31:12.01]No, listen, no.
[31:13.67]Don't give me any more money saying that.
[31:15.75]No way.
[31:16.87]Look, I like the way this fits.
[31:19.39]Look, let's... No!
[31:22.21]Remember, Jeremy, underwear.
[31:25.34]You are currently wearing underwear.
[31:26.66]That's not a good idea.
[31:28.06]Look, it fits well.
[31:30.00]Look at how it like sits on me.
[31:31.06]You know what I mean?
[31:31.60]Like sits on the shoulders well.
[31:34.17]It makes me look like I got like a dirty fucking sloppy like hair.
[31:36.91]You know, that's a big, that's a big deal.
[31:40.66]No, I'm not going to rip this off.
[31:42.62]This fits really well on me.
[31:44.02]I would stand up and show you, but like, take a look.
[31:50.50]What's this face I'm doing?
[31:51.94]Oh, I hate my, look at my face.
[31:53.42]Look at this.
[31:56.14]This looks like I'm wearing a dirty toupee.
[31:58.22]It really does.
[31:58.76]Looks like I'm wearing a dirty toupee right now.
[32:05.33]Where am I going?
[32:14.01]Why does my shirt look like a Black Ops 2 emblem?
[32:16.89]It's just a green shirt that I like the color green and I like how it sits on me.
[32:20.03]It sits on my shoulders nicely and it shows off my bust.
[32:23.80]That's why I wear it.
[32:26.14]I need to fast travel.
[32:39.59]You want me to bring you pain?
[32:40.53]No, it's fine.
[32:42.29]Look, I, I, look, Dr. Disrespect, like, showed his penis on stream.
[32:46.33]Who cares?
[32:48.27]That's alright.
[32:48.84]If it's, like, if it shows me from, like, this ground up, whatever.
[32:54.34]Didn't he do that, like, fucking, like, a week ago?
[32:56.06]What do you want me to say?
[32:59.11]Where are we going?
[33:06.11]Uh, status safe.
[33:07.87]Status safe.
[33:08.65]Alright.
[33:08.91]I don't even know where this is.
[33:09.93]Alright.
[33:12.41]Ridgewood Farm.
[33:15.03]Gaptooth Bridge.
[33:15.55]Can I travel to Ridgewood Farm?
[33:17.03]Or Rio Bravo?
[33:19.46]Ridgewood Farm.
[33:23.90]He did not do that.
[33:27.66]No, he like showed his like underwear.
[33:28.96]He was like in his underwear on stream.
[33:31.40]I've seen the clip.
[33:36.41]And by the way, he's... By the way, let me just... Can I just say... He's a funny motherfucker.
[33:41.20]Like, let me just say that.
[33:43.62]He is.
[33:48.76]He's been around for a long time.
[33:50.02]What am I doing?
[34:00.93]I remember Dr. Disrespect was making, like, Call of Duty videos, like, seven and a half years ago.
[34:06.39]He's been around a long time.
[34:09.15]No official endorsement, but, like, I think that the man, Dr. Disrespect, he's a very quick, witty person.
[34:16.09]He knows comedy.
[34:16.73]He does.
[34:19.99]He just does.
[34:20.35]Like, I'm going to tell it to you straight.
[34:21.89]Like, Dr. Disrespect knows comedy.
[34:24.31]He just knows it.
[34:24.87]He just does.
[34:25.31]That's it.
[34:40.85]We're talking comedy.
[34:41.59]Oh my god.
[34:44.09]Uh, Gap Toothbridge, right here.
[34:52.15]Who are my favorite comedians?
[34:59.72]Uh, hmm.
[35:02.90]Let's see.
[35:05.78]Oh, Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle.
[35:07.38]Eh.
[35:14.72]Steve Martin.
[35:23.14]Louis CK.
[35:31.26]I guess.
[35:33.90]Jim Davis.
[35:39.45]I mean, Ricky Gervais, when he actually did stand up back in the day, maybe.
[35:46.96]George Carlin.
[35:47.60]Alright, what was that?
[35:55.90]We live in Desert Sage, right?
[36:03.04]Ricky Gervais.
[36:04.27]What?
[36:05.91]Gervais.
[36:07.81]Okay, Bo Burnham.
[36:08.63]I'll tell you a story about Bo Burnham.
[36:11.13]I used to think Bo Burnham was painfully unfunny.
[36:14.69]like, seven or eight years ago.
[36:16.27]Like, when he was doing, like, his YouTube shtick, I thought, I didn't think he was very funny.
[36:20.31]But, like, Bo, like, Bo Burnham in the last, like, three or four years, I think, I, I've, I've come to become, like, a, like, I think he's actually very funny.
[36:28.78]I do.
[36:30.22]I didn't think, originally, I didn't think he was very funny.
[36:34.54]That was not Desert Sage, by the way.
[36:39.53]I guess we gotta keep going up here.
[36:47.02]Amy Schumer?
[36:47.76]I don't think... I can list you comedians that I don't think are funny too, and there's like a fucking hundred of them.
[37:03.54]Amy Schumer.
[37:04.40]No, let's not get into like a fucking comedian fight.
[37:07.86]Everybody knows that Amy Schumer is not particularly funny.
[37:11.12]Oh, dude, did I just do that?
[37:12.28]I just did it, didn't I?
[37:13.64]I did just do it, didn't I?
[37:18.72]I think I just did it.
[37:19.90]I did it.
[37:20.38]It's okay.
[37:20.92]Let's put it this way.
[37:22.44]If you want to talk about female comedians, let's talk female comedians.
[37:27.56]Caitlin Olsen is literally the funniest woman alive.
[37:32.18]She's fucking hysterical.
[37:34.36]She's not particularly a comedian, but she's a comedic actress.
[37:37.75]Get the fuck off me.
[37:39.23]Get off me.
[37:40.07]Get off me.
[37:40.51]Dead eye.
[37:41.19]We ain't losing this.
[37:48.93]Okay.
[37:51.19]Nice front flip.
[37:52.25]That same front flip was in Armory of Two.
[37:56.80]You're talking about a bird.
[37:59.16]Caitlin Olsen on Always Sunny in Philadelphia and like in other things, she has the comedic timing of a fucking genius.
[38:08.85]She's right up there with anybody else.
[38:10.81]She's fucking hysterical.
[38:15.34]So there you go.
[38:15.76]Like, if you want to talk about, like, female comedians, go watch, like, Always Sunny and, like, enjoy Caitlin Olsen's phenomenal performance in that show.
[38:29.29]But, I mean, Always Sunny as a show is perfect.
[38:34.92]I mean, Always Sunny and Curb Your Enthusiasm are the two best television comedies that have ever existed.
[38:40.28]And, I mean, if you'd like to combat that with me,
[38:44.64]It's just not gonna happen.
[38:46.05]We're gonna get into a fucking large fight.
[38:48.41]If you don't think that Curb Your Enthusiasm is the funniest television show to ever be made, you and I have an issue at this point.
[38:56.13]We have an issue.
[38:56.73]And Garfield is close.
[38:57.79]No!
[38:59.79]Don't talk about Garfield.
[39:05.80]See, not Seinfeld for me.
[39:08.46]Not Seinfeld.
[39:09.62]I think Curb Your Enthusiasm is funnier.
[39:12.37]than Seinfeld, by a long shot.
[39:14.79]I don't find Jerry Seinfeld to be particularly funny.
[39:19.83]Like, Jason Alexander is funny.
[39:21.15]Seinfeld's not funny.
[39:23.70]The guy made a career of going like this.
[39:25.20]Like, okay, whatever.
[39:35.57]Am I in the right spot, by the way?
[39:47.80]That's exactly how you made your career.
[39:49.66]Hey, hey.
[39:52.72]Easy.
[39:53.36]Hey.
[39:54.28]Easy.
[39:55.34]Easy.
[39:56.74]I did not make my career going... Hey, this is me going like this.
[40:00.97]I did not do that.
[40:01.61]There was fucking real work in those videos.
[40:05.43]How dare you say something like that.
[40:09.24]I did not make my career going like this to say, hi, I'm a little funny guy.
[40:13.84]How dare you make that assumption?
[40:27.19]Real work.
[40:28.67]Hey, come on.
[40:29.03]Jerva Rumble live action was $10,000 of my own money.
[40:33.06]Come on.
[40:33.48]Like, give me, like, at least a shred of credit here.
[40:36.94]That's 10 grand I will never get back.
[40:40.28]And I will do it a thousand more times.
[40:41.84]I will do that again a hundred times.
[40:44.71]I spent fucking $10,000 on that video.
[40:47.33]Give me at least a fucking shred of lettuce.
[40:53.69]Alright, where am I going?
[40:55.03]I gotta stick, like, I have to stay, like, around here.
[41:04.11]Hey, there it is.
[41:09.48]That's not it.
[41:12.72]I thought it was 7,000.
[41:14.98]The exact number, you know, for taxes last year, I had to like put that number together.
[41:21.05]It was like 8970 something.
[41:23.13]It was like just about $9,000.
[41:24.07]You round up in those cases.
[41:26.11]It was like 8,900 for total.
[41:27.77]You want my tax?
[41:28.49]You want to see my taxes?
[41:30.39]You want me to release my tax returns?
[41:33.49]I'll do it.
[41:34.63]Donald Trump won't do it.
[41:43.42]What did you say to me, motherfucker?
[41:49.24]What, was that guy a bad guy?
[41:55.75]I thought that guy was a bad guy.
[41:56.95]Never mind.
[41:58.99]Wait, sit at camp?
[42:02.80]I thought that guy was gonna shoot me.
[42:05.94]That guy was gonna- I thought it was a blip on the screen.
[42:08.18]I thought he was gonna murder me or something.
[42:09.46]I don't know, like the blips in this game don't make any sense.
[42:16.73]Alright, here's why it costed so much.
[42:19.75]Uh, to rent that venue alone was like... The venue and supplies for the venue were like $4,600 over the course of like three days.
[42:32.49]All the costumes.
[42:34.23]There's a lot of... There was like a lot of costumes.
[42:36.03]And they were like at least like $50 or $60 each.
[42:39.70]There's like 20 people in that rumble.
[42:42.20]All the makeup.
[42:43.44]Glue Man alone was like fucking like $89.
[42:45.14]Maybe it was like $100.
[42:46.24]There was a makeup artist on set.
[42:49.80]He was like fucking money.
[42:55.67]And I'll do it all again.
[42:56.53]And I'm going to.
[42:57.51]I'm going to do it all again.
[43:00.92]Can we please progress the fucking story?
[43:03.04]For Christ's sake.
[43:15.09]No, no, no, no.
[43:15.55]So you guys don't have any idea.
[43:17.87]Like, you have no idea.
[43:19.51]Like, you have no idea.
[43:20.55]And I can't even tell you what you don't even have an idea about.
[43:22.69]I can't.
[43:24.29]Because it's not even real yet.
[43:25.67]But like, you have no idea.
[43:29.51]what's possible in the coming months.
[43:32.23]I can't say anything because there's nothing set in stone.
[43:34.61]Nothing is real yet.
[43:36.65]All I'm telling you is there could be something fucking insane that I am offered.
[43:43.84]I can't tell you what it is.
[43:45.20]And I can't even begin to explain what it is.
[43:47.88]Because it's not real yet.
[43:49.82]If it ever is real and I'm allowed to talk about it, the second I'm able to, I will.
[43:55.67]Literally like the fucking second I'm able to talk about it, I will.
[43:59.35]But I can't, because it might not be real.
[44:01.35]You know?
[44:02.03]It's like, what do I do?
[44:05.43]I don't know what to do.
[44:07.52]Because on one hand, you know, there are things... There are things being worked on, and I've talked about at least a few of them.
[44:13.90]Some of them I haven't.
[44:15.48]And some of them I can't ever talk about until they become real.
[44:20.63]That's like the shittiest way I can explain that.
[44:31.54]Has been streamer touts vague possible future wait what no I can't fuck if it fucking works man you guys I'm gonna shit my pants and so hopefully so do you Because it's gonna be so worth it And I'm going to dedicate my fucking entire life to it and hopefully it's good let's be fucking real vague I Sincerely hope it works out.
[44:58.35]I honest to God do I
[45:03.48]How many more of these do I need before... How many more of these things do I need before I get in trouble?
[45:12.05]What did you say to me?
[45:12.79]Alright, uh... Oh, wait.
[45:21.54]So why did... What happens... What happens when the fucking immovable object comes across the unstoppable force?
[45:31.73]Nothing, apparently.
[45:39.05]I shit my pants regularly.
[45:40.11]Now... Like, the main channel.
[45:44.57]This is what I'll tell you.
[45:46.81]The main channel months ago was supposed to be, like, a continuation of making produced videos and... Making, like, a few of them every, like, six months or so.
[45:56.87]And there hasn't been one there in a long time.
[45:59.45]I'm painfully aware of this, guys.
[46:02.21]So... When I'm told...
[46:08.73]that there's a possibility to make those much better.
[46:13.96]But I can't do it yet.
[46:17.26]Is where I run into an issue.
[46:20.40]It's either do I keep, just do I make something now?
[46:24.45]Or do I make the thing that I wanted to make much, much better?
[46:28.31]I don't know.
[46:33.11]But that's not set in stone.
[46:34.37]It's just like a thing that's like in talks.
[46:38.41]When things are in talks, it doesn't fucking mean it's real.
[46:41.79]It's weird.
[46:42.61]Hollywood and fucking like LA and it's a weird fucking place.
[46:45.51]And I just, it's a weird fucking spot because you don't even, how the fuck are you supposed to know anything?
[46:51.15]I need one more of these.
[46:57.56]I'm done talking, by the way, because I'm going to accidentally say something I shouldn't be saying.
[47:08.46]Whoops.
[47:10.30]No, it's not even a whoops.
[47:11.36]Look, just listen.
[47:13.87]The main channel hasn't had any videos because there's like three projects currently being worked on regardless of where they're going to go.
[47:20.83]I don't know.
[47:25.46]But you're going to see them.
[47:28.42]I don't fucking care where they go.
[47:34.40]Please give me one more Death or Sage.
[47:43.21]No, it's not like a fucking TV channel.
[47:45.43]I don't know.
[47:47.11]I can't say anything.
[47:47.67]I'm done.
[47:49.51]I'm done.
[47:51.73]There are three projects currently being worked on.
[47:54.25]Two of which I literally cannot even say out loud.
[47:58.67]Because I don't know what's going to happen to them.
[48:05.64]I honestly don't.
[48:08.11]And for me to tell you something like, oh, hey guys, listen to this.
[48:10.31]Listen how cool this is.
[48:11.49]It might not even be real.
[48:12.57]So, why even bring it up in the first place?
[48:16.75]It's very possible, though.
[48:19.41]Nine months?
[48:19.93]It's a baby pro- No!
[48:21.15]No babies!
[48:33.07]Just bear with me.
[48:33.63]That's all I ask.
[48:35.47]Whatever it is, hopefully it'll be worth it.
[48:38.09]I promise you one thing.
[48:39.87]Whatever it is, I'm going to put as much work into it as I possibly can.
[48:46.10]And... It's all... It's all to make... Look, I'm trying to be sentimental here.
[48:54.30]What do you want?
[49:14.12]He does have a point like you should have moved you actually should have moved out of the way Please give me one more desert sage, please I'm not bringing her back to town.
[49:34.27]I have to collect desert sage.
[49:35.49]Oh
[49:42.06]What I was going to say is... Like, regardless of what it is... Like, I'm going to try to do it.
[49:49.33]I'm gonna try to... I've always wanted to do this shit.
[49:52.17]I've told... I've talked about this before.
[49:53.51]Like, I've wanted to make, like, fucking videos.
[49:56.81]Like, movies and shit.
[49:57.95]And, like, little shows.
[49:58.83]Like, that's literally what I've always wanted to do in my life.
[50:03.20]And if I'm given an opportunity to do something like that, I'm gonna... It's gonna be the best as I can possibly fucking do it.
[50:08.66]I'm gonna try as hard as I fucking can to make that a reality.
[50:11.81]That's all I can say.
[50:12.59]I'm gonna play the movies.
[50:20.43]That's it.
[50:20.83]That's the big secret.
[50:24.32]Just give me one more Desert Sage, for the love of fucking God.
[50:35.69]Get up there, you fucking dumb horse.
[50:45.01]Movie stream confirmed.
[50:47.51]I still want to do that.
[50:48.75]That's going to take a lot of work, but this fucking double opportunity here.
[50:55.84]No, that's not it.
[51:00.40]Wish this game was on PC?
[51:02.20]I do too.
[51:03.34]Watching my videos for two years when I was in a bad place.
[51:06.38]You're already playing TF2.
[51:07.24]It made me laugh so I couldn't stop smiling.
[51:08.77]Thanks for the good videos.
[51:09.51]Keep up the good work.
[51:10.03]Well, thank you.
[51:11.85]Thank you very much.
[51:16.36]I don't... I, like, started doing this because... You know, here we are.
[51:19.76]You're gonna start getting really... You're gonna start crying.
[51:24.15]Where was the other one?
[51:29.97]Where the fuck was the other one?
[51:33.63]It was on right here.
[51:35.23]Where'd it go?
[51:39.60]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $10.
[51:42.04]Rat Movie 3 confirmed.
[51:43.42]You know, here's the story for Rat Movie 3.
[51:45.91]Raid Movie 3 is not going to happen anytime soon, but here's the plot, just in case you want to know.
[51:51.01]I wanted to hire, um, like an actual 3D animator, like hire an animation team.
[51:56.79]And, you know, I probably shouldn't be saying this right now, but, you know, this is like the fucking, like, here, let's talk secret stream, so this is like a secret stream.
[52:01.95]Uh, I wanted to hire a 3D animation company to make the next one.
[52:07.79]And I wanted to try to get as many sponsors as I possibly could.
[52:11.18]I wanted to get like fucking Crest to like Colgate.
[52:13.72]Fucking like diapers and shit.
[52:14.82]I wanted to contact as many fucking companies as possible and get as many sponsorships on the video as possible.
[52:21.26]And it was gonna be like a fucking sponsored video with like fucking 60 sponsorships.
[52:27.06]And the rats were gonna like talk about how they're gonna wear like hats and shit at like different companies.
[52:35.90]And the whole video was gonna be all about like fuck sponsorships.
[52:39.84]And then I was told by somebody that that probably wouldn't be a good idea.
[52:45.39]The sponsors were going to fight in the video.
[52:48.27]It was going to be like Colgate versus Crest or something.
[52:50.55]I was going to contact them separately and have them both in the video.
[52:55.13]And whoever I determined to be the better company was going to win.
[52:58.66]Mythical creature!
[53:00.82]Mythical creature.
[53:01.66]It's a fucking horseman.
[53:03.52]How do I get down there?

[55:49.93]Passive.
[55:50.25]Okay, he just like walks in.
[55:51.21]Okay, that's cool.

[56:01.55]Not going to run him into a pond.
[56:03.39]Not going to run him into a lake.
[56:09.13]What was I saying after this?
[56:10.81]Save the game.
[56:11.51]Good idea.
[56:12.21]I will.
[56:15.25]I need to hitch him, right?
[56:19.15]No, no.
[56:19.47]I got to hitch him.
[56:19.91]I got to hitch him first.
[56:21.53]I'm scared I'm going to save it.
[56:22.38]He's not going to be there.
[56:25.83]Like, will he be standing next to me after I save the game?
[56:29.48]He will, right?
[56:31.96]I can't save it.
[56:34.04]Look, you guys, you guys listen to me.
[56:36.78]Everyone always talks shit to me in this game.
[56:40.00]You can't, in the DLC, you can't save the game wherever you want.
[56:43.16]It doesn't work like that.
[56:48.10]We're gonna go up here and we're gonna save the game.
[56:50.74]I ain't taking any chances.
[56:57.89]Save hitch it I'm going to we're not fucking around.
[57:00.69]I'm not gonna lose war Save save save.
[57:05.83]What do you think I'm doing?
[57:15.55]Hitch hitch hitch.
[57:16.42]I'm trying
[57:20.10]Anyways, that was the plot to Ratboobie 3.
[57:21.38]It's going to be fully animated.
[57:23.50]And I actually asked a couple of companies about it.
[57:26.07]And it's going to cost like $40,000.
[57:31.29]So that's money that I don't have.
[57:32.99]Let's test out his passive.
[57:39.03]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[57:46.31]Worth it?
[57:47.43]Maybe.
[57:47.69]Alright, let's hitch this guy.
[57:52.69]Do a Kickstarter.
[57:55.31]Here's my problem with Kickstarter.
[57:56.49]I talked about this with the guy that helped me make the Jerma Rambo Live.
[58:01.84]Kickstarter makes me have to answer to people.
[58:08.36]And some people might not be happy with how the thing, how the project is going.
[58:12.14]If people were to give fucking thousands of dollars to something like that and it didn't turn out the way that they wanted...
[58:19.16]Or, like, something happened, I would feel terrible.
[58:21.91]And, like, I don't even want, like, you guys to feel obligated to have to pay for videos.
[58:25.51]You know what I mean?
[58:28.39]Like, if someone... Oh, yeah, I donated, like, fucking $7,000 to the Rat Movie 3 GoFundMe page.
[58:34.51]What if you don't like the movie?
[58:36.35]What if it's something that you don't like?
[58:38.75]I don't want to, like, have you feel like you've not... Like, it wasn't worth it for you.
[58:50.27]I just, I don't want you guys to feel like you... got, like, swindled.
[58:55.49]And it happens a lot on Kickstarter, even on projects that become completed.
[59:01.86]I'd rather spend some dumb fucking shitty company's money.
[59:04.30]Alright, so I'm just gonna, like, clip that, and, like, fucking post it somewhere, and, like, there you go, there's my guy.
[59:11.62]Like, oh, hey, uh, random company X that paid for, like, Jerma Rumble 3.
[59:15.38]And this is what he really thinks.
[59:19.02]Where's my horse?
[59:27.25]There it is.
[59:30.65]RIP sponsorship.
[59:32.69]But I don't want a sponsorship.
[59:34.47]It's weird.
[59:35.81]I'm a fucking weird guy.
[59:38.30]I'm a weird fucking person.
[59:40.68]Am I though?
[59:43.06]I don't know.
[59:49.90]$50 from mostly lost yeah, what kind of idiot would want to pay for a video As he said he gives 50 fucking dollars Well, that's a you made a good point there Thank You mostly lost though for the 50 fucking bucks I Don't know I just I Just don't I don't want people to have to fucking pay a bunch of money.
[60:14.14]I
[60:15.78]When you put up a GoFundMe, when you put up a Kickstarter, it's like, hey guys, give me your fucking money.
[60:23.31]Like shit like streaming, right?
[60:25.58]None of you guys are ever obligated to pay me a cent.
[60:28.16]Nobody is.
[60:29.79]You're here watching.
[60:31.84]If you enjoy it, you enjoy it.
[60:32.92]If you don't, you don't.
[60:33.82]But you don't have to pay for this.
[60:35.84]It's entirely optional.
[60:37.96]And yes, it's entirely optional to pay a Kickstarter, but you expect a product.
[60:42.82]You know what I mean?
[60:44.30]And I guess the product right here is me streaming.
[60:47.71]But it becomes a lot more of a tangible thing when it's a real Kickstarter.
[60:53.02]And there's no limit to like, oh yeah, like I gave like 10 grand to fucking Rat Movie 3 and it was a piece of shit.
[61:01.28]I regret giving that fucking idiot money and I hate him.
[61:06.04]I don't want that to be a possibility.
[61:16.10]To be fair, if no one felt the need to donate, this wouldn't be a thing.
[61:19.51]And you know, I totally understand that.
[61:23.07]And I get that.
[61:24.19]I do.
[61:26.09]There's a lot of people sitting here watching, and there's a lot of people over the years that have given a lot of money to let me live a life.
[61:30.95]And that's something I never take for fucking granted.
[61:34.93]Which is why it's hard for me to want to ask for more, right?
[61:37.39]Think about it, right?
[61:38.95]If there's a bunch of people watching this stream, and a bunch of you have already given a bunch of money,
[61:47.13]Like me asking you for more.
[61:50.45]I feel like that's, that's, where's the justice there?
[61:53.46]You know what I mean?
[61:53.92]Like, oh, like, hey guys, thanks for supporting my life.
[61:56.40]And like, I stream and thanks for paying for fucking all my shit.
[61:59.16]And like, you guys are fucking unbelievable.
[62:00.86]But hey, I got this video I'm thinking of.
[62:03.50]Can I get another $47,000, guys?
[62:12.05]It's something I don't want to ever have to have you guys feel obligated to do.
[62:19.54]You sure can.
[62:20.68]Embrace your inner sellout.
[62:22.96]Hold on, we'll talk after this.
[62:25.04]Hold on.
[62:26.06]Got him.
[62:51.25]Thank you, dear boy.
[62:54.07]Thank you, Cyrus.
[62:55.49]All these bits have to go to Rat Movie 3.
[63:00.07]I will put them away.
[63:03.60]Thanks, Good Burger, as well.
[63:05.02]For the $1.
[63:08.06]And Cigarette Spaghetti, thanks for the $10.
[63:09.86]Did I hear Jeremy say, give me your fucking money?
[63:11.64]You did not.
[63:13.28]You did not hear that.
[63:14.10]Where's my dork cube?
[63:16.32]Good Burger, it's on the way.
[63:18.97]But on the way, it's not on the way.
[63:26.17]Live action Jerma Rumble revenue to cost I mean I lost like I'm like in the negative like maybe like $7,000 YouTube doesn't make very much money guys like especially now
[63:54.08]I think for some reason we have this, hold on.
[63:56.30]Streamer been in debt.
[63:57.34]No, I'm okay, don't worry.
[63:58.12]Still in debt.
[64:24.65]What happened?
[64:28.05]Find the old parts at Riley's Charge and return them to where Riley's Charge.
[64:36.23]Where the fuck do I have to go now?
[64:39.62]Riley's Charge?
[64:41.60]Over here?
[64:49.86]Where the fuck do I need to go?
[65:04.85]Okay.
[65:07.95]Anyways.
[65:11.21]Phosphorus coating is a treatment that modifies all ammo to set undead ablaze with a blue fire.
[65:15.07]Open your satchel with the correct herbs on hand to coat your bullets.
[65:21.86]Really?
[65:22.76]Just walk over here and get burnt, please.
[65:26.44]Why are you not on fire?
[65:27.68]You're standing next to the fucking warhorse of the apocalypse, lady.
[65:33.03]Get out of here.
[65:36.15]Alright, so, like, could I?
[65:39.33]There's been plenty of opportunities as, like, a person that has been on the internet with an audience for, like, at least, like, four or five years.
[65:51.59]There's been plenty of opportunities for me to take fucking, like, videos and paid opportunities and paid sponsorships and take money from people and make something.
[65:59.58]I don't want you guys to see me that way.
[66:04.19]I'm naked, you know what I mean?
[66:05.29]I'm fucking nude in that regard.
[66:07.81]I don't want you guys to see me as like the, oh yeah, he just makes videos, he's just what he does, whatever.
[66:14.25]He's gotta fucking pay the bills, he's gotta fucking have like a random shitty video that got him four grand.
[66:21.12]I don't want that.
[66:23.08]That is the complete opposite of what I want.
[66:26.84]You can think whatever you want of me.
[66:28.66]You can think I suck, you can think I'm fucking stupid, you can think I'm a fucking moron, you can think my shit's not funny.
[66:33.87]At least you have an opinion on it.
[66:35.72]I don't want your opinion to be that I like am like the guy that fucking just makes videos for money.
[66:41.80]Abso-fucking-lutely not.
[66:43.33]I would rather quit making videos than be that guy.
[66:46.15]I'd rather quit streaming than be that person.
[66:49.25]Channel update stream.
[66:55.58]That's why I haven't done it.
[66:56.94]I haven't, like, fucking done it.
[66:58.66]And I'm not trying to stand on a pedestal.
[67:00.06]Like, look, I could be one of those people right now, and I could probably sound like it.
[67:03.42]Like, look at me.
[67:04.72]I'm so clean.
[67:06.68]I've never taken a cent from anybody, and I should be treated with more respect than any other streamer.
[67:13.12]I know this guy took money from this company.
[67:15.35]He's a loser.
[67:16.59]No, no, no.
[67:20.45]I just don't want you to think that of me.
[67:25.58]I don't.
[67:31.24]Oh, look at me.
[67:37.95]Let's go.
[67:48.92]Selfish streamer, I just want to look I just want to make videos and stream and I want to try to make them as interesting as I can That's that's what I'm trying to do And Primrose the goods for I want to go to the ghost primrose the great hundred fucking dollars and
[68:13.72]Going right to Rat Movie 3.
[68:15.98]This guy's a fucking loser.
[68:19.30]Well, thank you, Prim, for the $100.
[68:20.84]I don't want to be that guy, Primrose.
[68:30.81]And it's weird.
[68:31.95]It's hard.
[68:32.65]I'm going to be real.
[68:35.79]When somebody gives you $100, $50, $5, $20... Like, it...
[68:44.23]We've had talks like this before, is what I'm saying.
[68:48.69]And I don't want it to ever be like one of those things where it's like, hey, thanks for the hundred bucks.
[68:54.29]Okay, that's fucking great.
[68:55.37]Thanks, dude.
[68:56.28]You just gave me a hundred dollars.
[68:57.64]Okay, so moving on, let's talk about like... The point I'm trying to make is I want you to be valued as a viewer.
[69:04.90]And the only way that I can do that with a lot of people here...
[69:09.46]is to try to do as well as I can and try as much as I can to make every interesting video or every stream a reality, and I'm going to try.
[69:18.35]They might not always work out, and they might sometimes be a fucking piece of shit.
[69:23.51]I'm aware of this.
[69:24.51]I'm very aware of this, but I'm going to try.
[69:26.73]That's pretty much it.
[69:39.16]I've only been live for one hour?
[69:40.54]Where are you, old man?
[70:05.31]That was stupid.
[70:06.49]Nice of you to drop by.
[70:07.61]Saved by the cutscene.
[70:08.75]I really was.
[70:10.65]I would have died.
[70:11.29]Stop self-deprecating.
[70:12.65]I'm not.
[70:13.09]I'm not trying to.
[70:31.13]It's my favorite character, by the way.
[70:32.89]Okay.
[70:54.06]Thank you, Jen, for the $2.
[70:55.78]Here, please take my money, you sweet, kind little men.
[71:00.36]I'm headed south.
[71:01.76]I'm headed down to Mexico.
[71:03.63]I hear things are much better down there, not to mention the climate.
[71:08.94]You got a blister on your foot?
[71:09.94]Which ointment should you use?
[71:11.06]Uh, A&D.
[71:12.40]A&D ointment.
[71:13.34]Cover it for a couple days, and then let it, like, get to the air without any medicine.
[71:16.23]You could... A&D ointment.
[71:17.43]A&D ointment.
[71:17.69]Oh, thanks, bro.
[71:35.53]Also, thank you, Mr. Bushido, for the $2.
[71:38.25]Value me as a viewer, BibleThump.
[71:40.23]You do.
[71:40.53]I value all of you guys.
[71:41.79]There are fucking almost 2,200 people here.
[71:49.82]Like, you guys don't think I think about that all the time?
[71:51.84]Like, I do.
[71:52.52]Like, all the fucking time.
[71:55.78]It's like, I think about that shit all the fucking time.
[71:58.78]You guys are fucking remarkable.
[72:04.60]Why am I going to shoot this guy?
[72:05.62]How many of you guys aren't wearing pants?
[72:07.81]I'm not.
[72:08.15]So, I mean, that's one.
[72:33.05]Read this out loud if you think about it.
[72:34.91]B-O-J-K-A-44.
[72:36.19]How you doing?
[72:38.93]Read it out loud.
[72:39.49]Now, I am headed down to Mexico.
[72:50.65]Is there any chance that I will see you there?
[72:55.88]We shall see.
[73:00.61]I don't even know the name of the program.
[73:04.71]What the fuck is it called?
[73:08.81]Hey, I'm pinned down over here.
[73:10.03]Are you even playing?
[73:10.79]Hey, I'm pinned down over here.
[73:14.72]Are you even playing?
[73:18.06]What was that?
[73:20.60]Oh my god.
[73:22.78]I'm sneaking now.
[73:23.64]I didn't do this.
[73:24.34]Why am I sneaking away from here?
[73:28.68]The Blunderbuss is an explosive weapon that can take out multiple undead at once.
[73:31.98]It uses undead body parts as ammunition.
[73:35.98]Really?
[73:37.04]It may take some time for Wes Dickens to find a way into Nueva Perizo.
[73:41.64]In the meantime, you should visit the other survivors to see if you can lend them aid.
[73:45.40]I gotta... What?
[73:54.11]Is war still alive?
[73:54.83]Yes, war is.
[73:59.27]Brundenbluts.
[74:01.39]Thank you, Syllogism.
[74:04.37]Oh, Syllogism0 for the $20.
[74:07.93]So you could literally make anything and I'd watch the shit out of it.
[74:12.56]Well, thank you.
[74:14.60]It better be good, though.
[74:17.22]Like, it better be good.
[74:18.98]That's my mentality, is if you're gonna watch it, like, it better be fucking good.
[74:25.63]That's all I gotta say.
[74:27.25]Where's my fucking dragon?
[74:28.83]Where's the horse?
[74:31.24]Where's the horse?
[74:32.02]What did I do?
[74:32.60]Why is he not here?
[74:34.14]Why is War gone?
[74:38.56]He's alive.
[74:40.20]What?
[74:42.22]Why is he gone?
[74:43.06]He didn't die.
[74:44.22]Did he die?
[74:46.75]Wait, did he get cut-scened?
[74:51.45]Wait, did he die and then get cut-scened and he's dead?
[75:09.39]I cut-seened him.
[75:10.47]He fell off the fucking cliff.
[75:14.31]And he died.
[75:15.19]And then I got cut-seened.
[75:17.20]He's gone.
[75:17.70]Okay.
[75:22.76]Well.
[75:24.32]There he goes.
[75:30.90]I... Alright, I gotta pee.
[75:32.82]Let me take a fucking break.
[75:34.56]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[75:36.13]Give me a second.
[75:37.17]Be right
[78:50.00]I swear to God, there was a drink in this room.
[78:53.76]It's gone.
[78:54.04]It's not here.
[78:58.37]There was a glass with a drink in the room.
[79:02.67]It's not in the room.
[79:04.11]I didn't take it anywhere.
[79:08.25]It doesn't exist anymore.
[79:09.30]Okay.
[79:12.64]Let's go.
[79:18.45]So I, do I have to do?
[79:21.29]What do I, I thought that was going to open up the whole game after that.
[79:26.67]Do I have to do this?
[79:30.04]So I have to get a spitter and bring it here.
[79:37.50]Snake took, I, You saw what happened last time I tried to get a spitter.
[79:43.78]The drink got cut-seemed.
[79:45.61]I wouldn't be surprised.
[79:48.10]Uh, let's find a spitter.
[79:49.30]I guess.
[79:52.62]How do you progress the fucking game?
[79:54.12]Do I have to liberate every single town?
[80:06.40]Maybe I need to liberate every town or something.
[80:12.97]Go find the fidget spinner.
[80:15.45]What?
[80:16.53]What are you talking about?
[80:20.27]Respawn war I don't I can't that's that's not war that's war horse watch ready That's not war that's my war horse See not war
[80:48.35]Everybody keeps screaming at me, and they don't realize that I have to get all four of the fucking four horsemen before I'm able to get any horses.
[80:58.03]There's no horses.
[81:01.85]Just light this one on fire and call it a day.
[81:04.83]So, um... Well... I was under the impression that when I did the flower mission, it would unlock the rest of the game.
[81:13.76]And that's not the case, so what's going on here?
[81:17.73]I don't... What's happening here?
[81:25.32]Am I gonna find all the horsemen?
[81:30.37]Self-immolate or no balls.
[81:34.11]Show you fucking balls on this guy.
[81:47.93]You got balls now?
[81:49.45]You got balls now, huh?
[81:54.67]No!
[81:56.07]Where'd the horse go?
[82:00.70]Come here.
[82:02.78]Oh, self-immolator, no balls.
[82:04.06]Look at that.
[82:05.38]Yeah.
[82:07.68]That'll never fucking tell me I don't got big balls again.
[82:11.56]I got some of the biggest balls.
[82:12.90]Why'd he scream?
[82:18.68]That would tell me how you don't get fucking large bulls.
[82:32.09]Do an IRL stream?
[82:34.85]No, what am I going to do in an IRL stream?
[82:36.45]Just fucking look at the camera and be ugly?
[82:40.67]Hey guys, this is an IRL stream.
[82:42.22]It's me, and I'm fucking ugly.
[82:44.14]Hey!
[82:45.38]Spinner?
[82:48.44]Uh... The fuck are you doing?
[82:51.14]Are you gay?
[82:59.83]There's fucking animals everywhere!
[83:01.13]Hold on!
[83:01.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[83:03.57]Wait, hit forward.
[83:05.25]Get... That guy... That guy ish floated.
[83:13.66]Where's the camera going?
[83:17.28]Stop this!
[83:20.27]Why do they have to be dogs everywhere?
[83:27.72]And they just... I gotta run.
[83:36.02]There's way too many of these fucking people here right now.
[83:42.47]Are you a spitter?
[83:43.67]No.
[83:44.13]You're just standing around like a bloody idiot.
[83:51.46]These things go around way too fast.
[83:53.30]They can't be shot.
[83:54.18]They have to be fucking s- they have to be s- slow-bowed.
[84:00.97]Use the blo- Ow.
[84:04.01]Don't do this to me, fucking video game, please.
[84:08.39]Not right now.
[84:09.59]I don't deserve this.
[84:19.30]Fine.
[84:19.96]You want to get fucking blunderbussed?
[84:23.74]What did I- I don't even know what I shot at.
[84:25.85]I hit somebody behind him.
[84:32.09]Okay.
[84:32.81]Exploded.
[84:34.43]Explosion.
[84:35.09]Okay.
[84:41.60]You fucking little dickhead dog.
[84:46.70]Where'd he go?
[84:50.65]Okay.
[84:52.35]Now we can actually capture this person.
[84:55.81]And we can complete this mission.
[84:58.48]Hog time.
[85:01.30]Talk about accuracy.
[85:02.12]Come on.
[85:02.98]Don't be mean to me.
[85:06.04]Don't be mean to me.
[85:08.10]Come here.
[85:08.44]Wowie.
[85:12.24]We've got a wowie situation.
[85:14.38]Come on over here.
[85:16.82]Mmm, shit.
[85:18.52]Can I pull a gun out?
[85:19.40]Yes, I can.
[85:21.62]You fucking dickhead.
[85:23.16]You fucking dickhead.
[85:26.86]Get away from me, please.
[85:29.96]If she's alive, she better be alive.
[85:32.16]Okay.
[85:40.23]At least I can complete this and then I can finally potentially beat this dumb DLC.
[85:46.35]Fantastic Zombies and How to Miss Them.
[85:50.11]That movie wasn't any good, by the way.
[85:53.27]Like, that was a very, like, 6 out of 10 movie.
[85:59.59]There's a lot of zombie parts that I missed, but I don't care.
[86:01.61]This has to be finished.
[86:02.81]I'm not gonna get jumped on by a fucking seagull.
[86:14.09]I think that was the good guy.
[86:21.94]Wrong way.
[86:23.54]Shit.
[86:24.16]Wrong way.
[86:24.52]He's right.
[86:33.57]Sorry, guys.
[86:40.39]That was a good movie.
[86:41.77]Alright, so the first... Here's the thing.
[86:43.03]The problem I have with Fantastic Beasts is they tried to make like four movies and make it one movie.
[86:51.04]Half the movie was, oh, we're going to find fantastic beasts.
[86:55.38]The other half of the movie was, there's a criminal on the loose.
[86:58.48]The other half of the movie was, there's a person that's a mysterious person.
[87:03.40]And then the other half of the movie was like a love story.
[87:06.52]They tried to make like three or four movies at the same time.
[87:11.18]Make it about like fucking Newt Salamander and how he like finds monsters.
[87:16.31]Not about like the fucking, like, oh, by the way, this is a fucking bad guy.
[87:19.45]It has to be a bad guy.
[87:24.36]Four halves?
[87:25.88]Excuse me.
[87:26.82]That was a 200% movie.
[87:29.90]200%, not 100%.
[87:30.22]Oh, God.
[87:37.76]I'm not ripping my shirt off.
[87:39.82]I'm not ripping my shirt off.
[87:41.61]I already told you I'm not going to rip my shirt off.
[87:43.39]Cigarette Spaghetti has, in total tonight, given like fucking 300 and something dollars.
[87:50.33]What are you doing with that shirt, bud?
[87:52.15]I like this shirt.
[87:53.27]I'm not ripping this shirt off.
[87:54.63]I like it.
[87:55.25]I'm sorry.
[87:55.83]No amount of money can make me... It fits on me well, it sits on me well, and it fucking looks great.
[87:59.71]I will not eat it with fucking ham.
[88:01.65]I will not eat it in the fucking park.
[88:03.56]I will not eat it with a Stark.
[88:05.66]I will not eat green eggs in the mail.
[88:07.02]I'm gonna keep green eggs and ham on my body, is what I'm trying to say.
[88:09.88]Thank you.
[88:17.33]So.
[88:18.53]Cigarette spaghetti.
[88:22.65]Just take it off.
[88:23.31]No!
[88:23.47]I'm not ready.
[88:26.05]I could buy a new shirt with those bits, but it will never fit me correctly.
[88:29.45]This has been through the wash a bunch of times, and it sits well, and it feels good.
[88:33.05]It says Mexico on it.
[88:35.95]It's like, I like, it's got a good design.
[88:40.73]I'm back at the gym, yes.
[88:42.13]As of, like, four days ago.
[88:44.69]Me and Kim were like, let's, we're gonna do something like, actually, we're gonna actually go to the gym, for real.
[88:48.82]Let's see what happens here.
[88:53.63]Oh my god.
[88:56.72]Jesus Christ.
[89:02.94]It's too good.
[89:03.50]This shirt's too good.
[89:08.21]Cigarette spaghetti with another hundred bucks.
[89:10.17]It's too good.
[89:11.89]I like this shirt a lot.
[89:13.95]I'm not ripping this shirt.
[89:15.39]It's got sentimental value.
[89:17.71]It was given to me by a fucking priest.
[89:21.91]A fucking priest gave me this shirt, okay?
[89:25.53]He blessed it and then he gave it to me.
[89:30.02]And he said, if you ever take that shirt off and you ever rip that shirt, I'll know.
[89:34.10]God will smite you.
[89:36.34]It's a $400 shirt.
[89:38.22]I'm not ripping this shirt.
[89:39.82]Cigarette, you've given a fucking ton of money, but I'm not going to rip this shirt.
[89:44.05]I'm not burning this shirt.
[89:45.27]I'm not ripping this shirt.
[89:46.65]I'm not soiling this shirt with my shit.
[89:48.67]I'm not pissing on this shirt.
[89:52.59]It was blessed by a fucking priest in a church in Mexico.
[90:05.26]What did this guy think was going to happen?
[90:09.10]Ungrateful.
[90:09.72]No, I really like this shirt.
[90:12.10]I do.
[90:12.70]It's like one of my favorite shirts.
[90:22.61]Why would he rip his sh- Valuing his shirt over fa- I'm not gonna Hulk Hogan this shirt off on stream!
[90:31.48]That's not gonna happen!
[90:32.78]And that was the fucking- That was the fucking French physicist, whatever his name is.
[90:37.02]What was his name?
[90:38.60]And I still don't have another fucking mission to do.
[90:42.33]What is this?
[90:46.01]I- What other mission do I have to do?
[91:00.47]I got no pants on.
[91:01.67]You can't like show me on stream with no pants on.
[91:03.85]Don't worry.
[91:04.21]They always hire you.
[91:05.81]Don't show up.
[91:06.35]Don't like stream me naked.
[91:08.23]Oh fucking my god.
[91:09.37]You better not have.
[91:11.23]You better not have just streamed me naked.
[91:15.69]Give me a fucking break.
[91:18.43]You better not have been videotaping me naked.
[91:25.31]You fucking better not have.
[91:27.27]I swear to God.
[91:32.01]Leaked nudes.
[91:34.73]I'm in like a gray pair of underwear.
[91:36.43]I'm not ripping that shirt.
[91:37.59]Alright, Kim just brought in a shirt for me to like to rip it out.
[91:40.79]I like this shirt too.
[91:42.45]No, look, I like, I like this shirt too.
[91:49.17]I'm not ripping this shirt.
[91:50.37]I'm not ripping it.
[91:50.95]Look at this.
[91:51.33]My hair is like fucking sweaty.
[91:53.94]I'm getting all flustered.
[91:56.58]I'm not ripping this shirt on camera.
[91:58.62]We're not ripping shirts.
[92:01.56]I like this one a lot.
[92:08.17]Rip my underwear.
[92:09.33]I'm not ripping my underwear either.
[92:10.61]I'm ripping my underwear.
[92:19.39]It's alright.
[92:19.87]It's like Dr. Disrespect did it.
[92:21.64]It's okay, right?
[92:22.62]We're gonna be fine.
[92:24.52]Doctor Disrespect did it.
[92:25.90]It's okay.
[92:26.40]He's got like fucking 75 million concurrent viewers.
[92:28.90]We're gonna be fine.
[92:34.64]I like my shirt more than my fans.
[92:36.22]That's not true.
[92:37.74]No.
[92:38.22]Cigarette spaghetti.
[92:39.15]I...
[92:43.19]Doesn't the dollar bill say, in God we trust, don't priests take money from collection plates, also known as offitorios?
[92:51.94]Perhaps a blessing of bits is the shirt's purpose.
[92:54.04]No, I like this shirt.
[92:56.90]Can I rip, like... No, I want this fucking shirt.
[93:06.61]What is this clip?
[93:15.81]I'm naked in that.
[93:16.35]What are you doing?
[93:17.17]I'm naked in that fucking video.
[93:20.65]I know I'm naked.
[93:23.75]You turn that off.

[93:40.17]I didn't ask for this.
[93:41.72]I'm sitting here with, like, fucking socks on.
[93:45.74]It's alright.
[93:46.38]Doctor Disrespect did it, so we're going to be fine.
[93:56.59]Alright.
[93:57.17]Alright.
[93:57.65]Alright.
[93:58.07]Alright.

[96:31.54]I would rather bury my head...
[96:34.18]I'd rather sit in a fucking bathtub of acid than watch the emoji movie one time.
[96:45.02]I'd rather all fucking 25,000 of you line up and spit in my mouth than watch the emoji movie.
[97:00.77]By the way, how fucking dare them?
[97:03.03]How dare Hollywood make an emoji movie?
[97:06.75]What is this fucking millennial shit, by the way?

[97:18.08]Goddamn millennials.
[97:20.66]Their emojis.
[97:25.48]Alright, let me get in here.
[97:27.29]There's apparently a guy with a band-aid on his head over here.
[97:31.74]They canceled Popeye for that movie.
[97:33.24]That's unfortunate.
[97:38.09]Millennials.
[97:40.53]I am a millennial, okay?
[97:41.73]So, let's be honest.
[97:42.29]Rampaging scrub, thanks for the $50.

[97:57.29]Wasn't that a Genndy?
[97:58.16]I'm going to say his name wrong.
[98:01.40]Genndy Tarofsky?
[98:01.88]He was going to make that movie.
[98:03.98]Genndy Jembo Dorofsky?
[98:05.46]What's his name?
[98:05.88]Millicent Waterbury.
[98:22.83]Gandhi.

[98:54.08]How do I get out of here?
[98:55.20]Do I have to press Y on the door?
[98:57.14]How do you open the door?
[99:09.42]Get me the fuck out of this town.
[99:12.87]No, don't put a gun in his face.
[99:14.29]Granted, did he?
[99:20.99]You pronounced his name so incorrectly, it hurts my animation major heart.
[99:24.59]What's his, how do you pronounce it?
[99:26.28]Spell it out phonetically in the chat.
[99:28.56]It's Gendi, it's Genedini Tartofsky.
[99:33.14]I need a full phonetic, phonetics.
[99:39.18]Gendo.
[99:41.69]Grenadine.

[100:04.48]Tartakovsky.
[100:06.88]Howie Mandel.
[100:07.66]That's not who we're talking about.
[100:11.77]Gennady Tartakovsky.
[100:15.49]Gennady Tartakovsky.

[100:38.24]Look at that.
[100:44.83]Fucking nailed it.
[100:51.73]I just got so scared.
[100:59.17]I thought he has a machine gun.
[101:02.29]Where are you going?
[101:06.24]Get out of the fucking way.
[101:09.58]Ride the wave.
[101:10.24]That's all you have to do if you want to find a place to move.
[101:14.74]Hey, cigarette spaghetti with another like fucking 600 bucks tonight.
[101:18.61]Jesus criminy.
[101:21.25]Another 10 bucks.
[101:22.93]How's the progress coming on that shirt?
[101:24.53]I ain't ripping it.
[101:26.91]No, don't make me rip my shirt.
[101:29.87]This is my lucky shirt.
[101:30.55]I won like $1,600 at the casino with this shirt on.
[101:34.47]I can't rip it.
[101:36.29]Every time I wear this shirt at the casino, I win like $1,000.
[101:39.14]I'm not losing this shirt.
[101:41.84]Then I'm gonna start losing at the casino.
[101:43.34]And then I'm gonna start crying.
[101:45.86]Oh look, another fucking person to save.
[102:03.94]Let's actually do this one.
[102:19.74]I'm gonna get off.
[102:21.70]Have I ever shit my pants?
[102:22.82]Plenty of times.
[102:27.22]I have shit my pants.
[102:28.30]Maybe if I'm gonna... I'll be realistic with you guys.
[102:33.13]77 times?
[102:35.93]That's way too much.
[102:36.65]No, no, no, no, no.
[102:37.49]I take that back.
[102:39.81]35.
[102:41.15]Maybe.
[102:41.83]What did you give me?
[102:47.34]What the fuck are you doing?
[102:54.16]You just shot my horse twice.
[102:57.00]What was that for?
[103:00.70]Where the fuck are you going, dude?
[103:04.59]This guy's so dead.
[103:07.65]You know how I can tell?
[103:08.41]Because I'm the one who shot him.
[103:19.74]Welcome to the apocalypse, motherfucker.
[103:24.66]Undead bits.
[103:25.58]Okay.
[103:37.66]This guy's fucked.
[103:43.12]I'm too fucking... I'm too fucked up to let this get to my head.
[103:46.27]I think that's what a lot of you guys don't understand.
[103:50.43]You know what keeps my ego in check?
[103:52.83]Me being fucking mentally unstable.
[103:59.16]Not in a bad way.
[104:01.29]In a very good way.
[104:02.93]Not in a bad way.
[104:08.11]You fool.
[104:13.09]Nice.
[104:13.43]Same.
[104:13.87]Same.
[104:14.11]Something's going on in here.
[104:22.62]We already talked about my complex.
[104:23.98]We went over it before.
[104:26.16]I have ADHD, OCD, a slight case of minor depression with a little bit of, like, bipolar.
[104:30.46]Like, I'm all over the place.
[104:31.76]I'm fucking everywhere.
[104:33.98]But that doesn't mean that I can't love.
[104:47.89]In one shot.
[104:48.45]Ah, I didn't get one.
[104:53.11]Didn't get one.
[104:53.91]Sorry.
[104:55.15]I'll get him.
[104:56.83]Got him.
[104:57.09]We got TVs, microwaves.
[105:03.32]Streamer is incapable of love.
[105:10.52]What do I have to do?
[105:14.40]I'm not going to shoot her.
[105:15.12]I need to complete this.
[105:21.80]Hey Jerma, what's your opinion on the viability of the Albuquerque Drive in Deep Space War?
[105:29.08]That's a pretty nice FTL term you used.
[105:31.08]It's not even real.
[105:33.24]Next question.
[105:37.22]I've played that game before.
[105:38.20]It's a solid fucking 4 out of 10.
[105:46.77]I'm just kidding.
[105:48.29]That game's fun.
[105:49.59]It's fun.
[105:50.27]I'm kidding.
[105:50.87]It's a joke.
[105:52.93]That game's not fucking bad.
[105:54.43]Don't worry.
[105:57.75]It's a real concept.
[106:01.10]I don't even know what... It's okay.
[106:02.44]It's fine.
[106:09.00]Albuquerque Drive is a real concept?
[106:10.70]What does it entail?
[106:11.44]Tell me.
[106:12.80]I've got a fucking 148 IQ.
[106:13.48]I can probably process that in five seconds.
[106:16.48]Did you see them clawing at the house like a pack of wolves?
[106:20.62]It was like they could smell me in there.
[106:24.15]Why am I naked?
[106:26.31]It's comfortable to be naked.
[106:28.23]I'm not naked.
[106:29.59]I have long underwear on.
[106:38.12]Can she handle the wave?
[106:38.94]Yeah, she can.
[106:45.22]Holy shit.
[106:47.36]Oh my god.
[106:48.12]That is a lot of shit happening down there.
[106:54.39]420 bone drain IQ.
[107:03.74]Valley of death.
[107:04.98]I don't want to be down there.
[107:07.30]Man, I turned into a nice discussion.
[107:11.95]You do know that the IQ score is based on average intelligence of people in your age, so it just means you're smarter than most people your age.
[107:19.81]So what you're saying is that I'm smarter than the average bitch?
[107:25.01]Give me one of those.
[107:25.93]Thanks a lot, man.
[107:26.73]Right over here.
[107:27.57]Nice.
[107:27.89]Thank you.
[107:29.21]I got two people left and right that gave me fucking high fives for that one.
[107:33.23]You have a never do, motherfuckers.
[107:56.67]Yogi Bear doesn't wear a shirt.
[107:58.59]That's too bad.
[108:05.13]Wrong show.
[108:09.04]Yogi Bear's dead?
[108:09.90]No, no, no.
[108:10.56]They just made a very bad movie in 3D like fucking seven years ago.
[108:14.58]He'll be back in like ten years.
[108:15.70]It's a shitty company that made him.
[108:20.64]He'll be back in like fucking six years.
[108:26.58]Thanks to Kim, I got to see your below-average chub.
[108:30.24]Well, that's funny, because I watched the same clip you did, and it was my back.
[108:33.25]So, uh... Nice try.
[108:35.95]Nice try.
[108:37.31]I said thank you.
[108:38.75]Good luck helping your family, Mr. Marston.
[108:40.83]I ain't ashamed of nothing.
[108:47.16]I ain't ashamed of shit.
[108:49.38]Come at me.
[108:54.08]Uh, hydroxin.
[108:55.10]Thank you for the $35.
[108:55.58]Hey, Jerma, it's Kyle from the candy booth from last week.
[109:01.44]Oh!
[109:02.04]Oh, shi- Ow!
[109:03.80]Ow, fuck!
[109:05.54]Oh, I just slammed my fucking hand down on the desk because I remembered that I slammed it on this.
[109:11.44]This thing's spike.
[109:15.53]Ow, fuck.
[109:18.47]Alright, no, this is real.
[109:19.27]This is real.
[109:19.65]This is a real thing.
[109:20.35]Ow.
[109:21.19]Ow.
[109:23.82]Uh, Hydroxin.
[109:24.60]Hey, it's Kyle from the candy booth from last weekend's Comic Con.
[109:28.85]Thanks for meeting and talking to me.
[109:30.35]It really made my whole weekend.
[109:31.95]Hopefully we'll cross paths again someday.
[109:34.73]Well, thank you for the 35 fucking dollars, dude.
[109:36.71]That's very generous of you, first of all.
[109:40.03]Second of all, so me and Kim went to Northeast Comic Con this past, uh, when was it?
[109:47.19]Fucking like two days ago?
[109:48.21]Was it like yesterday?
[109:50.18]Ow.
[109:51.32]No blood.
[109:51.64]We're good.
[109:53.22]It was a couple days ago.
[109:55.26]And, uh... We just, like, heard it was a... There's, like, Boston Comic Con, there's, like, San Diego Comic Con, and this random place that's, like... I was like, holy shit, that's, like, that's, like... We can, like, get there if we get in the car and drive for a while.
[110:09.63]I got on my, like... It's, like, it was close enough where, like, I got in the... We got in the fucking car and we drove to it.
[110:13.73]I mean, it was a pretty long fucking car ride, but who gives a fuck, right?
[110:18.77]So, anyways, Maude... No, we're not doing the Maude Kyle joke.
[110:20.99]We're talking about this.
[110:23.53]So, at the Northeast Comic Con, walk by a booth, and this guy, like, only person to stop me.
[110:30.46]Just stop me.
[110:31.90]I didn't get stopped by anybody in the whole entire convention.
[110:34.66]It was, like, in a mall.
[110:36.18]It was, like, a random fucking mall.
[110:37.44]It was, like, the weirdest thing that me and Kim had, like, ever seen.
[110:39.67]Uh, didn't make, like, any sense, but regardless of any of that, it was, like, hard to find.
[110:45.81]Um... Like, this... That's you.
[110:48.89]That's this fucking guy.
[110:49.83]He was at the Garfield booth, and he was selling Garfield memorabilia.
[110:55.00]Sorry.
[110:58.26]Anyways.
[110:59.78]Very, very interesting.
[111:00.67]Thank you, Kyle.
[111:02.47]Hopefully you made some sales.
[111:05.83]Because you were talking about how it was very slow.
[111:08.71]And it was.
[111:09.13]There wasn't very many people there.
[111:12.85]The guy chopping wood didn't have a head.
[111:14.23]Are you serious?
[111:18.44]Do I have the no head glitch again?
[111:26.31]Oh, great.
[111:27.41]This is fucking fantastic.
[111:36.40]Oh, shit!
[111:37.60]Oh, no!
[111:38.56]What am I gonna do?
[111:40.14]Who's head do I have?
[111:42.02]Oh, we made it out alive.
[111:45.47]Fucking idiots.
[111:47.89]Let's save it and reload it.
[111:51.85]Anywho, uh, Northeast Comic Con, uh, funny story about Northeast Comic Con.
[111:55.81]There was a Who Framed Roger Rabbit poster that was signed by Christopher Lloyd.
[112:01.53]Judge Doom, obviously.
[112:02.71]I love that movie.
[112:04.72]We walked by it in the very beginning of the convention.
[112:07.72]And, hey, there's like a fucking ton, there's like, there's like 150 posters along this wall.
[112:14.54]And it was like a hundred, it was expensive.
[112:15.72]It was a fucking hundred bucks.
[112:18.65]What?
[112:19.67]Is my game broken?
[112:27.57]What the fuck?
[112:32.22]Game's broken.
[112:43.73]Um... Okay.
[112:52.62]So, walked by it in the very beginning of the convention.
[112:55.96]And, well, when I say beginning, I mean we got there at like noon or something.
[113:00.52]Nobody, all these, this huge rack was all posters.
[113:05.63]Hey, on the way back, we'll see you, we'll get it, we'll get it, right?
[113:08.71]Remember, I told you, like a fucking, like a hundred and something posters were on this wall.
[113:12.65]On the way back, after like two or three hours of walking around and talking to people and checking out some stuff, it was one of the only fucking two posters that were purchased.
[113:20.07]It was gone.
[113:21.45]I was so fucking angry.
[113:22.75]I was so sad.
[113:23.41]I just wanted the goddamn Christopher Lloyd signed Roger Rabbit poster.
[113:34.37]Cigarette spaghetti, 50 bucks again, which brings you to like 500 and something dollars this stream.
[113:39.93]You destroyed the game, now destroy the shirt.
[113:44.52]I told you.
[113:45.76]I tried to tell you.
[113:46.68]I'm not going to
[113:49.81]You gotta buy shit fast.
[113:50.95]I didn't even think about it.
[113:52.25]But, cigarette.
[113:53.79]I can't rip it.
[113:54.81]I broke Army of Two on stream.
[113:59.07]That game was like $7 at GameStop.
[114:03.98]And like, that was so hard for me to do.
[114:07.36]Do it.
[114:08.26]I can't get another one of these though.
[114:10.50]Find a way into Mexico.
[114:16.87]Is W... Okay, W is still there.
[114:21.38]Like, I sincerely appreciate all the money, dude.
[114:23.86]It's fucking a lot.
[114:25.81]I can't rip the shirt in half.
[114:27.41]I love this shirt.
[114:29.37]It means like $70,000.
[114:31.97]That's not true.
[114:36.74]I can't rip my shirt off.
[114:37.74]I'll get banned.
[114:39.18]I'll be in my underwear on camera.
[114:41.26]I'll get like literally banned from Twitch.
[114:51.99]Find a way to part with your shirt from... No, we're not ripping shirts.
[114:58.75]Put it on Twitter.
[114:59.63]Different shirt.
[115:01.86]Just go get a green shirt and pretend it's the same shirt.
[115:04.92]Just go buy a fucking $1 Hanes shirt.
[115:10.42]Rip a different shirt.
[115:13.20]Kim, if you're watching right now, do I have a shitty white Hanes t-shirt that I can Hulk Hogan off my body?
[115:27.02]Let's see some other bits here somebody else gave some money to I Missed a lot actually Thank You Cyrus for the bits Rascal thanks for the bits Dubski dude thanks for the bits Here's two dollars to burn your own house down and if you don't do it live then you obviously don't love your fans also if you call yourself a
[115:55.12]or your hair ugly again, I swear I'll go to Boston and take you out on a hot date.
[116:02.63]Well, Dubsky, I'm sorry to tell you that I'm taken.
[116:06.71]I've got a fucking GF, you know what I'm saying?
[116:09.31]But thank you.
[116:14.15]Let's go to W. I'm sure there's a spider in there somewhere.
[116:24.12]Am I broken here?
[116:27.24]You barely... About what Kyle was saying.
[116:29.70]He barely broke even.
[116:31.76]That's unfortunate.
[116:35.56]Help me.
[116:38.85]Taking care of him.
[116:40.19]I ran into all the fucking three of yous.
[116:42.73]Who cares?
[116:47.93]I have a shirt.
[116:49.27]Fine.
[116:50.85]Give me a second.
[116:52.29]I'll be right back.
[116:53.36]Fine.
[116:53.50]Fine.
[116:54.56]I'll rip a shirt on camera.
[116:55.42]Fine.
[116:57.63]Give me a minute.
[119:07.88]You guys want to see how fucking strong I am?
[119:10.14]Fine.
[119:11.68]You want to rip a shirt on stream?
[119:13.64]Fine.
[119:15.32]I'll do it.
[119:17.28]It's okay.
[119:17.74]How's this one for you?
[119:22.05]How's this shirt for you?
[119:26.49]Ready?
[119:27.83]One, two, three!
[119:29.65]I've been fucking lifting lately.
[119:50.43]Hey, Red Dead Redemption.
[119:51.33]Here it is.
[119:51.63]I love how delayed that was.
[119:59.93]Look at how delayed this was.
[120:04.39]This was so delayed.
[120:05.63]I need to watch this.
[120:06.99]It's okay.
[120:10.11]Hold on a second.
[120:11.67]The audio delay because of the fucking game capture sync.
[120:14.21]How's this one for you?
[120:18.21]How's this shirt for you?
[120:22.64]Ready?
[120:23.98]One, two, three!
[120:28.06]That was so unnecessarily loud.
[120:31.85]Ready?
[120:33.19]One, two, three!
[120:38.71]It's for people... Okay, for people that just came to the stream...
[120:47.14]They're probably just like, what the fuck?
[120:48.42]This guy ripped off like a plain white shirt to reveal Mexico under her shirt.
[120:54.43]Why?
[120:55.19]Why did this guy just do that?
[120:56.45]I don't know.
[120:56.85]There you go.
[121:00.77]My bloodlust is now quenched.
[121:02.09]You didn't think I was going to get it first try, did you?
[121:05.49]No, you fucking better believe I get that first try with one rip.
[121:11.33]You think for a second I'm not going to fucking get that first try, rip the whole thing?
[121:15.95]That was like, cigarette spaghetti gave like fucking $475.
[121:19.35]It's gonna happen.
[121:27.38]No, I said him.
[121:28.72]No, it's my shirt.
[121:30.30]It's a white t-shirt.
[121:31.52]That wouldn't fit her.
[121:32.34]Do it with a phone book?
[121:44.39]Fine.
[121:47.90]I'm not dealing with the public.
[121:48.80]Ride the wave.
[121:51.14]Got it.
[121:54.16]I said hurtful, but I'm a fucking idiot.
[121:55.84]My brain is fucking melted cheese.
[121:57.52]Alright, we got a fucking cutscene here.
[122:01.81]Everybody climb down.
[122:02.37]Everybody climb down.
[122:02.99]Cutscene.
[122:22.72]I'm sick of seeing this fucking guy.
[122:24.76]Can I be real?
[122:47.26]But I thought things were better in Mexico.
[122:49.70]Well, better or worse, it's certainly different.
[122:54.62]So why am I going and not you?
[122:57.47]Well, that's a matter of age, dear boy.
[122:59.45]The army don't have many... Thank you, Dubsky dude.
[123:03.97]So I'm not single, my man.
[123:05.39]Just because there's a goalie doesn't mean you can't score.
[123:09.49]So what will it be, steak or fish?
[123:11.33]No, that's not how this works.
[123:13.07]I am monogamous.
[123:16.59]I have one for... Kim is it.
[123:18.07]Thank you for the three dollars, though.
[123:19.29]This guy's been a very large part of this DLC.
[123:22.29]I like him a little bit.
[123:47.68]Moron streamer, how dare you?
[123:49.02]Kim can come too.
[123:50.56]First of all, how dare you?
[124:17.83]What was that?
[124:18.17]That was like a weird AI glitch.
[124:19.79]Glitches.
[124:20.25]I think I have bullet holes in me too.
[124:23.07]That's funny.
[124:25.51]Hey, thank you D-Man Fun for the $1.
[124:27.61]Nice shirt rip.
[124:28.25]Well, thank you.
[124:28.73]I tried as hard as I could.
[124:33.66]Twitch limits me to buying 500,000 bits per day.
[124:37.18]I wanted to give you another 100 for actually ripping this shirt.
[124:40.36]Dude, don't.
[124:41.32]Cigarette, dude.
[124:43.44]Cigarette.
[124:45.45]You gave way more than that shirt costed to rip.
[124:48.53]So don't worry.
[124:49.51]You're good.
[124:50.09]Trust me.
[124:51.07]Thank you, though.
[124:51.87]I really appreciate it.
[125:04.95]How many bits for a quick kiss?
[125:08.09]Zero.
[125:10.35]Not applicable.
[125:13.71]The uniform you need is somewhere in the camp.
[125:15.35]You can choose to earn it by helping a deserter or steal it and suffer the consequences.
[125:20.13]I'm gonna steal it, of course.
[125:23.47]Alright.
[125:29.29]Well, this is easy enough.
[125:31.33]Just gonna shoot some undead in the face.
[125:38.75]Damn it.
[125:39.13]I didn't get it.
[125:40.31]Trying to get his head there.
[125:48.42]Kissing booth.
[125:49.16]Dude, how fucked up are kissing booths?
[125:51.24]Can we talk about that for one second?
[125:54.16]For like a second?
[125:54.98]Horse, get out of the way.
[125:56.28]Get out of the fucking way, horse, before I have a little bit of a meltdown.
[126:01.23]A kissing booth.
[126:03.46]You don't know, like, where people have been?
[126:04.74]You don't know, like, what kind of fucking, like, weird, like, mouth diseases somebody has?
[126:08.68]You don't know, like, a kissing booth?
[126:10.96]Like, $4 for a kiss?
[126:13.54]Out of your goddamn mind?
[126:14.54]You don't know where these people have been?
[126:18.58]You don't know, like, a fucking, like, harbor?
[126:19.96]I'm gonna be sick for all you know.
[126:25.51]Why am I such a prude?
[126:26.87]No, I'm just telling you the truth.
[126:28.69]You sick freak?
[126:32.84]That guy's not... That guy's not playing.
[126:34.60]It's okay.
[126:36.70]He's just watching.
[126:37.59]He's AFK.
[126:46.43]One.
[126:48.74]Two.
[126:50.74]Killed and remaining undead.
[126:51.70]It's just this guy right here.
[126:54.04]His buddy across the way.
[127:01.32]None of us are sick.
[127:02.84]Well, sorry.
[127:06.52]I'm taken.
[127:07.70]I'm taken.
[127:17.69]I'd rather get two pizza slices than your mono lips.
[127:22.69]I'm pinned down over here.
[127:23.55]Are you even... I am playing.
[127:28.97]Undead bits.
[127:33.14]Sorry.
[127:37.00]How many bits do I need for the Blunderbuss?
[127:44.86]How much to stream Red Dead?
[127:46.08]I'm streaming Red Dead right now.
[127:49.30]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $5.
[127:52.59]Quick game for a quick kiss.
[127:56.57]No kisses.
[127:57.71]Like, why are we talking about kisses?
[128:00.89]Who brought up the kissing thing?
[128:03.82]No kissing, no like kissies, like what are we talking about here?
[128:06.62]I'm in the uniform and let's get to business.
[128:18.75]Oh, I hate this fucking Yogi Bear outfit.
[128:22.85]This really is a fucking man in the yellow hat.
[128:25.33]What's the guy?
[128:26.39]A ranger.
[128:27.11]What's a Yogi Bear ranger?
[128:34.97]I will allow you to open a kissing booth.
[128:36.89]No, I'm not opening a kissing booth.
[128:38.49]No, we're not doing kissing booth.
[128:43.79]No fucking way.
[128:44.71]I don't want permission to open that.
[128:48.85]You're supposed to say, no, you are only for me, and that's it.
[128:53.17]That's what you're supposed to say.
[128:54.41]Come on.
[129:02.21]Ranger Smith?
[129:02.79]That's not his fucking name.
[129:06.89]Ranger Smith.
[129:07.69]I'm scared of cooties.
[129:22.88]I am not.
[129:29.14]I gotta clear out more of this shit.
[129:31.21]Alright, easy.
[129:32.37]Watch this.
[129:32.75]Let's fucking ram him.
[129:41.20]I could clear the whole station or just a little bit of it.
[129:45.63]Now, that's not gonna work, so I have to, like, kill them.
[129:56.29]One, two.
[129:57.69]Give me some more heads.
[129:58.41]Give me a clown head.
[129:59.21]Give me this guy too because he's going real fast.
[130:07.85]And that's not a zombie.
[130:12.63]I guess just get on the boat.
[130:15.09]Just been getting on the boat.
[130:20.88]One, two.
[130:35.10]You too.
[130:36.40]More coming up.
[130:37.49]This is fantastic.
[130:40.41]More of you guys coming to the kissing booth.
[130:45.01]This is what I picture.
[130:46.19]This is me in the kissing booth.
[130:48.62]Everyone's fucking scrambling to get a kiss from me.
[130:58.04]Turn it on.
[130:58.48]What the fuck?
[131:00.61]What's going on right now?
[131:08.58]That's a good guy.
[131:11.34]I think that's the banister.
[131:17.50]Well, that was a lot of people.
[131:24.79]Two more over there.
[131:32.97]Show your head.
[131:33.73]Let me see your head.
[131:34.35]There it is.
[131:38.46]Holy shit, he just murdered his viewers.
[131:45.93]Train goin'?
[131:46.39]Uh, when you drink moonshine, you get Deadeye for a long time.
[131:54.88]I can kiss them now.
[131:56.36]No, no more, like, kissy talk.
[131:59.84]What the fuck?
[132:01.40]What the fuck?
[132:02.76]Hey, Sir Feline, thanks for the five dollars again!
[132:06.00]Except he already gave it.
[132:06.96]And I'm just saying this already because it happened already.
[132:11.02]But while I got you guys here, Thursday expect a... I'm going to try.
[132:19.12]I'm going to try.
[132:21.80]We're going to try on Friday to do a Jerma Wrestling card with a bunch more characters on WWE 2K17.
[132:34.20]So, if you would like to watch on Friday, that's gonna happen probably Friday night.
[132:37.89]Thursday, not so sure.
[132:40.13]I'm hoping I can get SEGA CD to work.
[132:43.35]Maybe we can do that, or maybe I'll wait till next week for SEGA CD.
[132:47.95]But there'll be some interesting streams over the next, like, four or five streams.
[132:53.73]I'm not gonna promise a day, but, like, that's, we expect that soon.
[132:57.72]In the next, like, week.
[133:01.62]What the fuck is happening?
[133:02.52]Oh, we're taking the train to Mexico, I see.
[133:11.91]I should be shooting more than one person at a time with this, shouldn't I?
[133:20.81]I keep thinking X is reloaded.
[133:23.54]Night Trap.
[133:24.12]Night Trap is the first SEGA CD game we're going to play.
[133:28.18]A classic controversial video game from yesteryear.
[133:37.39]It is one of those games that's kind of weird.
[133:45.47]Night Trap is getting a re-release on PlayStation 4.
[133:47.53]But I don't want to wait.
[133:50.29]We're going to play it immediately.
[133:53.59]Has he ripped anything?
[133:54.47]Of course I have.
[133:56.09]I did rip something.
[133:57.45]I ripped his shirt.
[134:03.63]And there we go.
[134:07.79]He's got to be in the head.
[134:09.65]Train is moving though, which makes this a little awkward.
[134:11.87]A little bit awkward, but it's okay.
[134:28.78]What the fuck, dude?
[134:29.90]No, no, no, no.
[134:30.64]He's trying to jump down.
[134:31.64]Get on the fucking train.
[134:33.41]Holy shit, that would have been a nightmare.
[134:43.11]Look, there are so many people here.
[134:45.99]Like, what... What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[134:57.31]Saved it.
[134:57.73]Holy shit.
[135:05.38]This boat sure does move on land.
[135:11.45]That zombie is a what?
[135:19.73]Thank you, Ter, Terkot, for the dollar.
[135:22.37]Thanks a lot.
[135:22.95]Appreciate it.
[135:35.49]Date night charity stream.
[135:36.87]I ain't doing date night char- What am I gonna do?
[135:40.59]Am I gonna go to like Starbucks and like sit there and tell you where I am and like fucking kiss everybody?
[135:45.94]Like what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
[135:48.46]I'm not doing that.
[135:54.03]That's not gonna happen.
[135:55.13]That's just not happening.
[135:56.79]Mic bump.
[135:57.31]Yeah, you heard.
[136:07.50]Did you hear that some guy made $5,000 sleeping on stream?
[136:12.64]Well, that's fucking crazy.
[136:13.86]There's no ammo on this gun.
[136:23.57]Holy God.
[136:28.71]Stop hiding.
[136:29.83]Stop.
[136:38.72]Just walk over to everybody.
[136:47.68]One more.
[136:48.06]That guy got his fucking hat knocked off.
[136:55.96]Oh, he died.
[136:56.60]I need four shots here.
[137:06.16]One.
[137:07.34]Two.
[137:08.62]That guy's alive.
[137:09.56]He's a human.
[137:11.02]Three.
[137:12.22]Four.
[137:18.97]That guy came nowhere near me.
[137:20.59]That was bullshit.
[137:28.48]Let's ride the train again.
[137:31.98]Apparently we're okay.
[137:37.42]This game's fun.
[137:39.58]Fun game.
[137:41.64]Who couldn't like this game?
[137:42.80]How could you not like this game?
[137:43.74]It's fun.
[137:46.12]It's a fun video game.
[137:50.86]What am I gonna do?
[137:51.40]Let's go.
[137:51.72]It's on the train.
[137:54.40]Release the brakes.
[137:55.12]God darn it.
[138:03.98]Red Dead is the bomb, my dude.
[138:05.24]It is, I don't know.
[138:13.17]I think all the soldiers did die.
[138:21.87]But I think I'm going to... I'm going to call it here.
[138:25.31]I think probably when we get into Mexico.
[138:30.04]How long have I been streaming for?
[138:31.00]Like four hours?
[138:33.06]I don't even know.
[138:33.62]I lost track after I had to restart it.
[138:43.17]Travel to Las Hermanas.
[138:47.16]Two?
[138:47.50]That's not true.
[138:49.42]I was streaming for at least like an hour or so before the stream died.
[138:55.44]That was odd.
[138:56.22]My controller... I can't get back up here.
[139:02.41]Is my horse still alive?
[139:10.87]Los Pollos Hermanos.
[139:13.29]Rip another shirt.
[139:14.85]I'm not gonna rip another shirt.
[139:16.04]No.
[139:17.54]Sorry, guys.
[139:18.20]What are you doing down there?
[139:19.10]You're supposed to be up here.
[139:26.80]Why is this a new low?
[139:30.84]Which is better, the main game or this?
[139:34.06]Well, thank you, Clink, for the $1.50.
[139:38.10]Oh, I mean, the main game is probably better, just because there's more stuff to do.
[139:46.35]This is a very, very interesting add-on, though.
[139:50.95]If you get the Game of the Year edition, there's no reason not to play it, especially if you're a big fan of the first, the main game.
[140:02.04]What do you need to help this guy?
[140:07.26]He's going to turn into a zombie.
[140:08.50]I get you.
[140:09.00]Yep.
[140:09.46]Bruh, I'm a zombie.
[140:13.64]Yep.
[140:14.02]Okay.
[140:19.24]These ones don't make sense to me.
[140:20.77]I mean, I get it, but...
[140:32.93]But thank you Bloopsy also for the bits for the $2 now.
[140:36.87]Stream is rip-off.
[140:38.43]I didn't even get mentioned for 100 bits.
[140:40.51]We'll go watch Ster a Real Streamer instead.
[140:44.05]Well, you're perfectly fine to have opinions.
[140:51.52]Thank you for the $2 though.
[140:52.66]I appreciate it.
[141:04.22]Host me when you're done.
[141:06.74]Why would I... I don't even... I barely host Etalyx.
[141:10.42]I'm such a bad friend.
[141:27.69]This is a big town safety.
[141:30.22]Big town safety.
[141:35.39]I stopped him.
[141:35.75]Alright, I knocked his fucking head off.
[141:38.95]It looked like a zebra lady came over here and fought.
[141:41.93]Ah, easy.
[141:42.49]I gotta move.
[141:45.53]This is dumb.
[141:50.96]There's only three bullets in this gun.
[141:54.00]What happened to all my guns?
[142:02.68]Uh, let's go back to this rifle.
[142:06.02]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[142:08.62]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[142:12.57]Climb on a building, give, like, money to a survivor.
[142:18.19]Kim, you want to play PUBG?
[142:19.41]You can play it if you want.
[142:23.77]How did I get on fire?
[142:28.64]Misses all of his shots, what happened to my gun?
[142:30.18]Hey!
[142:32.94]Come on now.
[142:40.59]What?
[142:41.09]What?
[142:42.09]Why?
[142:42.93]What?
[142:43.91]What?
[142:45.15]What?
[142:51.25]Just walk towards me for all I care.
[142:54.99]I'm gonna get up the stairs.
[142:56.07]I'm gonna go in this fucking house.
[142:57.43]Get out of the way.
[143:01.27]Stop it!
[143:12.94]Thanks for posing for me.
[143:14.40]You did a great job.
[143:15.08]You too.
[143:15.38]You're all doing a great job.
[143:22.16]Wait, somebody died?
[143:25.63]An organizer of the town is dead.
[143:28.95]Okay.
[143:31.35]I tripped.
[143:31.93]I tripped over the fucking... I tripped.
[143:35.07]What is with this game and tripping?
[143:36.77]Why do you fall down?
[143:39.10]Oh lord.
[143:42.90]Eat this, motherfuckers.
[143:45.30]You can fucking handle that?
[143:49.82]I'm alive.
[143:51.30]No, I'm not.
[143:51.68]I'm dead.
[144:04.43]Well, there it is.
[144:07.59]Thank you so much for watching.
[144:09.77]I really appreciate it, guys.
[144:13.52]Just about four hours.
[144:14.84]I'm getting a little tired.
[144:16.62]That's not a rage quit.
[144:21.26]That's not a rage quit.
[144:22.36]That's like a I give up.
[144:23.84]I'm tired quit.
[144:29.53]Weak streamer.
[144:30.75]No, that's just I'm sleepy.
[144:35.05]Hopefully you enjoyed the stream.
[144:37.35]Thanks for sticking around.
[144:38.21]Thanks for hanging out.
