[00:08.59]Are you sure you don't want to join Berg?
[00:12.85]What are you offering?
[00:14.47]What is my deal?
[00:16.67]For every video that you upload with the clan tag Berg, the Berg CEO of Berg Industries gives you $5,000.
[00:23.55]$5,000?
[00:23.83]Yeah.
[00:24.51]Now we're talking about the CEO of Berg Associates.
[00:31.87]This is one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[00:35.79]Yeah, I can clearly tell that this is serious stuff.
[00:38.79]But... But you have to give me time.
[00:39.99]I have to, you know, talk this over with my agent.
[00:41.89]Well, in each upload, I forgot to mention, this is part of the stipulation, in each upload, you have to be completely naked.
[00:48.19]And there has to be a face cam on you.
[00:50.23]Like, on your naked body.
[00:51.85]I'm totally fine with that.
[00:52.63]Even if it got, like, flagged and you got removed?
[00:57.29]No, but I mean, can I do the uploads on livejasmine.com?
[01:00.67]Is that okay?
[01:01.65]No, it has to be on YouTube.
[01:06.10]And you can make, like, separate accounts.
[01:08.27]Yeah.
[01:09.21]I guess I will have to do that.
[01:10.49]Dude, you'd get arrested.
[01:14.77]Somebody actually has a... Oh, hello.
[01:16.45]Somebody actually has a McDonald's logo.
[01:21.11]I find that hilarious.
[01:23.11]No!

[01:27.95]He is going big.
[01:29.13]Going ham.
[01:31.19]I'm in the middle, guys.
[01:32.33]I keep forgetting that left click is not like melee.
[01:34.91]I keep trying to left click and I throw a friggin' blade at the wall.
[01:40.46]How does that make you feel?
[01:41.90]You're getting excited now, but you're gonna... I am getting very excited.

[03:03.00]I didn't know you, you said meet me at the statue.
[03:05.22]You didn't say I'm gonna kill you at the statue.
[03:06.96]I'm like, just stand here.
[03:09.72]Okay, I'm on the statue.
[03:10.95]Meet me at the statue.
[03:12.07]That means we're gonna hang out, not you're gonna throw a knife at my head.

[03:40.15]What did you expect?
[03:40.99]That we were gonna hug and, like, talk?
[03:42.53]I thought we were gonna, like, be weird.

[03:57.39]Alright, boo.
[03:58.49]We're gonna have to kill him Well once again, we're gonna leave here with quite a solid 125 points it looks like another victory here for orb he is going to try and not really play cool because he doesn't really sky and
[04:13.13]Only Orb will shellcast his own live gameplay about like how good he is.
[04:17.65]Shit, very surely.
[04:18.85]Yeah, you know what?
[04:19.61]Boo, are you ready for this one?
[04:21.17]It took me two games.

[04:43.71]Hey, Boo, I'm Charlie.
[04:44.78]I'm by the statue, guys.
[04:46.52]Where are you guys?
[04:47.82]Me and Boo have a mission right now to come destroy you.
[04:51.38]You're really pre-aiming me?
[04:53.88]Really?
[04:54.58]What are you talking about?
[04:55.98]Okay, I see how it is.
[04:57.42]I see how we're going to play this.
[04:58.74]Oh, shit.
[05:02.25]I've got... No, no, no.
[05:04.29]I don't have anything.
[05:05.15]Where is he?
[05:05.61]No, no, no.
[05:08.58]Behind you, what are you doing?
[05:09.82]I don't know where he is.
[05:11.36]Where is he?
[05:12.28]God damn it.
[05:13.20]I was behind you for the longest time.
[05:14.82]I missed everything.
[05:16.92]Hey, well, that shows.
[05:19.98]Well, 145 points, guys.
[05:21.00]I'm going to put this hatchet up your asshole.
[05:23.33]I believe we have another W in the vicinity of this game.
[05:27.81]Gemma, we got 40 seconds.
[05:29.21]Please make him count.
[05:30.23]I'm not even throwing.
[05:31.05]I'm trying to find him.
[05:31.73]We've come to that part of the game again where I like to talk.
[05:35.92]Where is he?
[05:37.26]145 points on the scoreboard here, and it's looking like it's got to be another victory here.
[05:43.34]He's been playing consistently throughout this tournament.
[05:46.35]And he is going to... You know, not really try because it's already... It's got to be a victory here.
[05:53.51]But he's going to walk around and try to let the opponent back him here.
[05:58.29]No, mate!
[05:59.62]Jesus!
[06:00.54]Oh, yes!
[06:01.12]You got him!
[06:02.18]What an evil guy.
[06:03.92]Listen, I don't believe in... It lagged.
[06:08.22]I lagged right there.
[06:10.12]Oh yeah, Berg.
[06:11.32]Dude, I played like shit in this game, and I got second place.
[06:15.88]Nice post.
[06:17.26]I lag, guys.
[06:18.50]Okay.
[06:19.62]I got bankrupt right here.
[06:21.48]Are you going to DDoS me right now, guys?
[06:26.02]Are you that amped to win?
[06:27.18]Are you going to DDoS me?
[06:29.88]See you, guys.
[06:31.35]I think I went right at the end, and then I got bankrupt with one second left.
[06:35.71]Jeremiah, what happened to our- don't you remember all the times we met at the statue?
[06:40.18]Yeah, I remember- I remember meet me at the statue so I can punch you in the face.
[06:43.19]That's like what happened.
[06:44.45]Did that mean nothing to you?
[06:45.85]Meet me at the flagpole after school.
[06:47.42]I'm gonna put like an icicle up your ass.
