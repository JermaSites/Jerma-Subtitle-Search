[00:05.21]Oh, part two.
[00:06.35]Live commentary.
[00:08.15]Oh, here we go.
[00:08.81]Part one was like five seconds.
[00:11.44]Should we reintroduce or just... Yeah, we'll just redo it.
[00:14.78]There's no reason to keep that.
[00:18.80]I mean, maybe we could use that to be funny.
[00:23.67]Oh my... Why am I so horrible?
[00:26.25]Oh my god.
[00:30.28]After we do this, like, after this round's over.
[00:32.93]But once we have to select our stuff again, then we'll do it again.
[00:37.39]Yeah, pick up that Galil.
[00:39.47]Oh.
[00:40.03]Oh, Galil.
[00:42.75]Control.
[00:43.45]Control RH 54321.
[00:44.45]Alright, let's see if he, like, computer crashes again.
[00:50.72]I don't know why I did that.
[00:52.68]Let's see how many frame rate drops you get, too.
[01:00.86]Hey, we're not, we're not ready yet.
[01:04.16]Wait, we have to wait, don't we want to wait until the next round thing?
[01:07.65]We play 30 rounds until that happens.
[01:09.89]Oh, uh, pfft, okay, next round, we'll, uh, let's just... 5-7.
[01:19.22]Gun of choice.
[01:20.58]Please don't headshot me.
[01:23.76]What's up, Bob?
[01:26.26]Gemma!
[01:27.80]Guy down below, low left.
[01:29.72]Shot of that, dude.
[01:31.83]Headshot at that dude.
[01:33.75]We're including this.
[01:34.43]I have two kills.
[01:38.97]The bomb is right here.
[01:39.85]Why is the bomb right here?
[01:40.95]Because I killed a guy with the bomb right there.
[01:44.35]Where is this son of a bitch?
[01:46.01]What do you mean?
[01:46.55]He dead.
[01:48.31]What do you mean?
[01:49.75]He dead?
[01:51.57]There's one guy left.
[01:52.59]I'm camping the bomb with this bad sniper rifle.
[01:55.53]He's probably down here.
[01:56.53]Headshot only sniper rifle.
[01:58.65]He's right here.
[02:00.97]Can I pull up my map?
[02:02.70]If I press M, no, that freezes my screen.
[02:04.74]Oh, MVP, Bob Slater HD!
[02:08.96]Alright.
[02:10.84]Okay, I'm recording now.
[02:12.82]Oh, I was already recording.
[02:14.42]If you miss what just happened, MLC_St3alth got player of the game!
[02:17.83]If you miss what just happened, MLC_St3alth just got a really good game, but I'm not gonna include it!
[02:23.05]Nah, just kidding.
[02:24.33]Alright, here we go.
[02:24.85]No, you're not just kidding.
[02:25.65]You're being serious.
[02:28.26]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[02:29.96]Jerma and MLC_St3alth here.
[02:32.56]We're going to be playing some CS:GO Live.
[02:35.46]And I'm not sure how well he's going to do, but I know I'm not going to do that well.
[02:39.52]But that's okay.
[02:40.69]Oh, I'm already dead.
[02:42.21]Oh, there's one.
[02:43.27]So, I'm not going to do very well.
[02:46.55]You better spectate me.
[02:47.51]I'm going to go on a tirade.
[02:48.89]This guy right here.
[02:51.97]Oh, get locked out.
[02:55.01]I just said the guy's name while I shot him.
[02:57.57]Anybody?
[02:57.97]What we got?
[02:59.07]Did you not mean to?
[03:01.15]I said his name, and I was subconsciously saying it, and I said it by looking at it.
[03:05.75]That was weird.
[03:08.15]There's only one guy left.
[03:09.91]I'm checking to see if there's any spawn brats.
[03:11.94]I don't know.
[03:12.90]This isn't Call of Duty.
[03:14.96]There might be somebody that's AFK.
[03:17.26]I gotta be careful here.
[03:18.88]You don't even have dead silence on you.
[03:20.62]You're just running rampart.
[03:23.08]Rampant.
[03:24.56]Our teammate's dead.
[03:26.16]Oh, so it's a one-on-one, huh?
[03:28.12]Where'd he die?
[03:29.42]I don't know.
[03:32.08]Okay, this is where it gets interesting.
[03:33.36]Pick up that sniper.
[03:34.46]Hey, just hit E, like, control me.
[03:36.10]I'm a bot.
[03:36.66]I'm trying.
[03:38.32]Oh, get out of town!
[03:39.73]Oh, yeah, nice crouching.
[03:42.55]Nice 60% of the team killing.
[03:46.07]I didn't really introduce me, but you introduced me for me, so it's alright.
[03:49.35]Well, introduce yourself for you.
[03:52.43]Alright, that's...
[03:54.34]Hey, everybody.
[03:56.34]Wait, I already have everything?
[03:58.34]Oh yeah, so we tried doing this live commentary once, but about 14 seconds into it, my computer said, no, and it just, like, canceled out of Counter-Strike.
[04:07.10]But as I was saying before, we're both, like, awful at live commentaries because we can't multitask.
[04:12.51]Yeah, I will agree with that.
[04:15.63]Please don't hit me.
[04:18.05]I have the op now.
[04:19.33]Why did I just click?
[04:20.03]I'm an idiot.
[04:21.29]I need to buy some grenades.
[04:22.15]Oh my god.
[04:24.53]Lockdown got his revenge.
[04:28.55]That means I can follow you.
[04:29.45]Well, there you are.
[04:30.51]Oh, you dead?
[04:31.43]Yeah, I'm spectating you now.
[04:33.91]Where am I getting shot from?
[04:37.11]Top and bottom, looks like.
[04:39.79]Oh, really?
[04:41.73]Come on, Slater.
[04:45.11]Did he shoot through the surface?
[04:47.19]I got killed by Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[04:51.66]Well, there goes my AWP.
[04:53.68]Dwayne, oh yeah, I got killed by Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[04:57.84]Yeah, I think that means they shot through a surface, I'm pretty sure that's what that means.
[05:01.57]On two and three.
[05:04.69]Dang, I'm just... See, I'm used to bots not knowing how to, like, move, and standing still in spawn and running the same way every single time.
[05:12.63]Why aren't these guys doing that?
[05:13.91]I don't know, I mean, these are... There's only one bot in this whole game, and he's on our team.
[05:21.68]Anyone see him?
[05:22.30]Already dead.
[05:23.58]Oh my god.
[05:24.46]Got killed by Dwayne again.
[05:26.32]Where is this guy that you just got killed by?
[05:27.94]Oh, people are really going to love the live commentary on my part.
[05:32.79]Spectating the whole time.
[05:37.47]It's just me!
[05:38.25]I'm the only person alive!
[05:39.41]Oh, great.
[05:41.25]This is fantastic.
[05:43.92]Get out of here.
[05:46.68]Oh, it was that guy!
[05:48.34]He's killing a lot of us.
[05:49.80]He's full of them.
[05:50.54]He must have seen me kill his brethren.
[05:54.58]He must have seen you kill Gangster Bobber.
[05:57.90]Only explanation.
[05:59.60]I didn't even use my grenades.
[06:01.24]I was so taken back by my team getting destroyed.
[06:03.49]Alright, this is gonna be the one.
[06:08.07]Me and you are both gonna kill the whole team, you ready?
[06:10.29]We sure are.
[06:11.05]I'm gonna get that MVP again like I did that one time.
[06:14.55]You did!
[06:16.91]I actually was recording.
[06:18.90]But you said you weren't.
[06:20.60]Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that I didn't have any pressure on you.
[06:23.62]Alright, I'm right behind you.
[06:24.70]I'm throwing, watch out.
[06:25.80]I'm throwing this in there.
[06:26.96]Eat fire!
[06:27.82]Oh, I'm dead.
[06:29.68]Do I have a bot?
[06:30.75]Oh, eat fire.
[06:33.93]Where's the guy?
[06:36.15]I'm sure if you keep shooting, he'll eventually run with your bullets.
[06:40.79]I don't want to get lucky headshotted, though.
[06:42.25]I always just turn the corner and go, and just get nailed.
[06:44.81]Well, that's what I've done for five rounds in a row.
[06:51.07]Not even guarding the bomb.
[06:52.19]Trying to get that last kill.
[06:53.97]There he is.
[06:55.17]Come on.
[06:56.89]Oh!
[06:57.49]God damn it.
[07:01.19]That sucks.
[07:03.37]Is he just going to sit back there the whole time?
[07:05.21]I don't know, probably.
[07:05.91]Look at our guy with the AK just trying to, like, straight shoot.
[07:08.55]Hopefully this pyro gets him, though.
[07:11.31]Did go.
[07:11.81]Sure did.
[07:12.83]Oh, no, no, no.
[07:13.51]Somebody else did.
[07:14.15]There you go.
[07:17.12]Do I have... I don't have money, because I keep sucking.
[07:22.30]I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go deagle.
[07:24.12]I think I'm gonna go deagle this round.
[07:26.02]Hey, give me money.
[07:26.90]I don't even have enough for, like, things.
[07:28.60]Hey, open a trade.
[07:29.22]I'll give you, like, a thousand dollars.
[07:32.21]Is that even possible in this game?
[07:34.43]I don't think so.
[07:35.39]Because... I'm not sure if you're joking or...
[07:38.92]Yeah, hey, open up a tray.
[07:39.82]Let me give you, like, a couple of guns.
[07:40.88]Hey, let's go right again.
[07:41.79]Because I have a sniper now.
[07:43.61]I'm way behind.
[07:44.49]I'm behind you.
[07:46.45]Oh.
[07:46.95]Looks like they're... You said you went right?
[07:49.87]Yeah.
[07:51.05]Was that you?
[07:51.45]Oh my god!
[07:55.46]This game scares the hell out of me, man.
[07:57.04]It really does.
[07:58.72]Can you crowd jump in this?
[08:00.90]Oh, don't worry.
[08:01.32]I took control of the bot.
[08:02.44]I'm good.
[08:05.75]I have a sniper rifle.
[08:07.65]Why does this bot have the default pistol?
[08:10.03]Oh, I just, oh, I almost shot you in the head, Gemma.
[08:13.61]Well, don't worry, I got shot in the head regardless from gangster boobies, whatever that guy's name is.
[08:18.97]I'm pretty sure I shot him in the head and nothing happened.
[08:21.53]There you are.
[08:22.79]Oh, no!
[08:24.67]I shot his up.
[08:25.79]God, gangster Bobby.
[08:29.53]Gangster Bobby.
[08:30.33]Hey, look, I killed him.
[08:32.38]You did?
[08:32.88]No, not even.
[08:34.64]Oh, I'm on ego.
[08:35.82]Ego is a reptile.
[08:36.80]Let's go.
[08:40.60]Time to buy the AUG and no body armor.
[08:45.29]See, that's a... Run with the pistol, man.
[08:47.71]Try and get one kill with the pistol.
[08:49.35]I've tried that several times.
[08:54.59]I'm just awful at this game.
[08:57.49]Right now, anyways.
[08:58.59]Don't be so down on yourself.
[08:59.90]You know what?
[09:00.24]You're right.
[09:03.11]I'm gonna throw this bomb over here.
[09:07.29]Now they can't come over here.
[09:08.75]Actually, that pretty much did absolutely nothing.
[09:10.83]I don't know why I did that.
[09:14.14]I'll shoot you through the barrel, you bastard.
[09:16.48]Oh, what?
[09:18.32]Who killed that guy?
[09:19.18]I didn't kill him.
[09:21.46]Oh, come on!
[09:21.86]No!
[09:21.98]Damn!
[09:28.82]This guy's trying to get, like, a wallbang.
[09:30.51]He's not even shooting at people.
[09:31.55]Alright, let's go EG Reptile.
[09:33.49]I'm pressing E. If we both press E at the same time, we might be able to override his attack.
[09:38.47]Can you come over?
[09:38.91]Let's see if he can do it.
[09:42.80]Yeah, throw that grenade.
[09:46.26]You see, he's all smoked out right now.
[09:47.68]He's in trouble.
[09:52.08]Uh-oh!
[09:56.00]Oh my god!
[09:56.78]Oh my god, this guy's gonna do it!
[10:01.11]He like, had that.
[10:02.99]He really did.
[10:03.67]I have to say something, I have to say.
[10:06.13]Damn!
[10:09.79]Alright, give me that Kevlar and Helmet and no money for anything else.
[10:14.15]You're just rolling around with Kevlar and Helmet in the default?
[10:16.26]Mhm.
[10:18.26]Well, at least you'll live.
[10:20.04]I'm starting out with zero dollars each round.
[10:22.70]You might live longer.
[10:26.04]This guy said, I don't miss.
[10:27.16]Okay, bullseye.
[10:31.23]I missed.
[10:32.03]Okay, Colin Farrell from Phone Booth.
[10:35.49]Oh, I just got flashed.
[10:37.85]Jeez, I'm like pan- I'm like afraid.
[10:39.72]This game scares me.
[10:40.94]Like, playing against bots, I'm all calm, but I can't even aim when I see like a person.
[10:45.72]Grenade out!
[10:46.56]Oh, I'm dead.
[10:47.10]Oh, it's just me again versus five people!
[10:50.80]Do I have a grenade?
[10:51.59]I do.
[10:53.37]Eat it.
[10:54.69]That rolled like a foot in front of you.
[10:56.55]Oh good, it didn't really.
[10:58.79]I pretty much grenade like blew myself up.
[11:03.47]Damn, this other team is whooping our ass.
[11:07.57]I'm out of money too.
[11:08.91]Dude, I was so confident there for a second.
[11:12.33]I had a bunch of money, I had a bunch of women power.
[11:15.94]Yeah, they're so much better than us.
[11:18.80]I don't have any, any, wow, this is not gonna be good.
[11:21.52]This is gonna turn out really bad.
[11:22.80]Kills each round.
[11:25.10]I haven't killed one person in like four rounds.
[11:28.88]I'm following you.
[11:29.62]Where's Jerma?
[11:30.70]Oh god, I'm on fire.
[11:32.20]And flak.
[11:33.54]Oh god, I just shot you.
[11:36.54]Oh, why do I have less health than a hundred?
[11:39.18]Wait, is that you?
[11:39.76]That is you, okay.
[11:40.45]Oh, he's right there, right there.
[11:42.57]Alright, there's one.
[11:44.45]Oh, I heard molotovs from our right.
[11:46.43]Watch out, watch out.
[11:47.75]Right to your left.
[11:48.43]Yep, there's a guy right there, right there, right to our left.
[11:53.97]Smoked him.
[11:55.45]I shot bullets in his direction.
[11:56.57]I was like, scare him a little bit.
[11:57.47]Is he looking behind us?
[11:59.10]Nice.
[11:59.76]Oh, right to my right!
[12:00.80]Oh god, he's... They're trying to close in on us.
[12:03.42]Oh, he's behind you!
[12:05.04]What?
[12:05.22]How did I not kill that guy?
[12:06.60]I don't know.
[12:07.84]Their entire team is better than... Every single player on their team is better than every single player on their team.
[12:14.99]I killed a guy.
[12:15.55]Alright, I'm going back to the 5-7, man.
[12:17.63]I'm telling you, I do way better with that thing than anything else.
[12:20.97]I don't know why.
[12:23.83]Alright, at least I have money.
[12:24.91]Hey, remind me I have an incendiary grenade so I don't, like, die with it in my hand.
[12:29.17]Hey, you have an incendiary grenade.
[12:30.79]Don't die with it in your hand.
[12:31.71]Alright, I appreciate that.
[12:33.57]Alright, let's go together.
[12:35.14]Let's die together.
[12:36.16]Well, at least we'll have double the chance of victory.
[12:41.40]Incendiary!
[12:41.98]I'm throwing mine, too, out there.
[12:45.02]Oh, no!
[12:45.92]Oh, no, I just probably killed that guy.
