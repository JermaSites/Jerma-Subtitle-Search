[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.99]I was here.
[00:02.81]For the Game Awards?
[00:06.43]I was here.
[00:07.44]Hi, everybody.
[00:18.38]Welcome to the Game Awards pre-show.
[00:23.71]And the Game Awards pre-show... I thought the Game Awards started at 5.30pm.
[00:29.77]No, it actually starts at 6.
[00:34.09]So... I mean, I guess we can see what's gonna happen before the show starts, but... I think we'll probably just talk about Minecraft for like a half an hour.
[00:48.24]Because I was gonna do that anyways.
[00:53.48]Now, people are probably going, why would you talk about Minecraft for a half an hour?
[00:58.38]This is a perfect opportunity to do it, but I want to make sure a lot of people are here to see it.
[01:01.65]Because we have a lot of important things to discuss.
[01:08.07]Because the Fuck the King stream is very, very, very rapidly approaching.
[01:13.77]We're going to go over it.
[01:18.73]We'll talk about it.
[01:21.45]We'll see.
[01:21.89]Well, actually, what did they do?
[01:23.09]Did they start on time?
[01:25.91]That's a better question.
[01:26.59]Did they start on time?
[01:27.75]No, it's a black screen.
[01:30.32]No, that's like an ad.
[01:32.62]What is this?
[01:32.96]What's this an ad for?
[01:35.12]I can't even hear it.
[01:36.58]What is this?
[01:37.68]To the Twitch Partner Program.
[01:39.53]I just got partnered.
[01:41.73]That was a Twitch ad.
[01:44.05]Should I not be showing this?
[01:47.07]Who just gifted, like, a thousand subs?
[01:50.05]Alright, we're gonna... Let's go back to this.
[01:59.94]Wait, hold on.
[02:01.42]The whole purpose of that was for me to see what was going on.
[02:04.89]On their stream.
[02:07.47]Don't do it again.
[02:10.21]They're late.
[02:11.35]They're late.
[02:13.60]It's supposed to start at 5.30.
[02:14.86]It's going to start at like 5.30.
[02:15.80]6.
[02:16.18]See?
[02:18.22]See?
[02:19.08]Even like a multi-million dollar production is 6 to 7 minutes late.
[02:27.15]So, come on.
[02:31.01]Their broadcast probably costs like 5 million bucks.
[02:39.38]Right now, Geoff Keighley is about to write in his chat.
[02:42.82]Guys, I have internet problems here, guys.
[02:46.58]Cox is fucking up.
[02:50.19]And I gotta let Otto out.
[02:51.91]Hold on, I'll be back.
[02:54.83]I forgot to go to the bathroom today, guys.
[02:57.31]Give me, like, another ten minutes.
[02:59.72]Have I eaten food today?
[03:01.42]No, I haven't.
[03:02.26]I ate a microwave burrito three days ago.
[03:04.76]I have to eat.
[03:11.81]Facecam, please.
[03:16.09]Everybody wants the facecam turned on for some reason.
[03:20.57]We got three minutes to the Game Awards.
[03:23.82]Oh, we gotta talk about Minecraft.
[03:32.10]Right, alright, Minecraft.
[03:35.36]I gotta get something on the screen.
[03:36.94]Forget about the game.
[03:37.90]The pre-show, it's like the, it's going to the movies, okay?
[03:42.65]If you've been to the movies more than once or twice in a month, you've seen all the previews.
[03:49.89]So, but the third movie you go to in the month of December is going to be the same previews that you saw two weeks ago.
[03:56.15]Who cares?
[03:56.59]You've already seen it.
[03:59.31]You've already seen the trailer for Gemini Man 15 times.
[04:02.99]You don't need to see it again.
[04:05.11]So we're going to talk about Minecraft.
[04:09.85]Yes, I do.
[04:10.71]No, you don't.
[04:17.21]I gotta turn off, uh, actually, no, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:20.26]This is important.
[04:21.80]This is really actually important to me.
[04:24.38]What time is it?
[04:26.64]I'm sitting here for two minutes.
[04:27.44]I want to see if they start in two minutes.
[04:29.80]I hope the counter goes up.
[04:31.24]I hope the counter goes up, like, another three minutes.
[04:37.03]I'm gonna sit here for two minutes.
[04:37.97]We're not gonna, we're not gonna watch, like, a second of the pre-show.
[04:40.61]Just to make sure we're clear on this.
[04:44.72]Why are you calling me a villain?
[04:45.78]Why is everybody calling me a villain?
[04:48.10]Because I decided that today I was going to relax today.
[04:51.80]But that makes me a villain.
[04:59.33]You want to just take a load off and relax?
[05:03.61]Don't comb your hair back.
[05:06.29]It sets there.
[05:07.51]I like the way that it sets.
[05:09.93]This is what I do on my days off.
[05:16.44]Listen to this epic music.
[05:18.44]Oh, people are giving subs and shit.
[05:20.84]Uh, Splarg gave five community subs.
[05:23.26]And, and, and something else happened too.
[05:27.49]What else happened?
[05:28.15]Somebody, uh, right now something happened.
[05:30.11]I don't have notifications on because this is a video game award.
[05:32.35]Somebody just gave a hundred dollars.
[05:34.27]Uh, Freddy Dredd, 10,000 bits.
[05:36.13]Thank you, Freddy Dredd.
[05:37.85]A hundred fucking, a hundred, 10,000 bits.
[05:42.17]Can I be in that ad?
[05:44.72]TEN THOUSAND BITS?!
[05:47.77]WHAT?!
[05:49.77]Uh, no.
[05:50.29]But seriously, that's a lot of fucking money.
[05:51.91]Thank you, Freddy.
[05:57.43]Forty seconds.
[05:58.57]Thanks for the hundred dollars.
[05:59.80]We haven't even gotten started yet.
[06:00.82]There's nothing on the screen yet.
[06:01.86]Alright, here are my predictions for Game of the Year.
[06:05.72]Game of the Year.
[06:06.70]I gotta say it now, before everybody else comes on camera that's not me and tells you their predictions.
[06:12.64]Game of the Year, Resident Evil 2.
[06:14.48]If Resident Evil 2 does not win Game of the Year this year, gaming is dead.
[06:19.62]Video games are dead.
[06:21.70]It's over if Resident Evil 2 does not win.
[06:28.75]That's a fact.
[06:32.89]Okay, let's see.
[06:35.77]It's 536 right now.
[06:36.51]Here it comes.
[06:39.15]Oh, it's not ready.
[06:56.93]What's going on?
[06:59.13]What's going on?
[06:59.49]Green Day is here?
[07:00.33]What?
[07:00.51]Gears mobile?
[07:17.38]and the world gets their popcorn ready.
[07:19.41]I've got mine.
[07:20.09]We've got 30 minutes of awards, special guests, and world premieres of our own right here in the pre-show.
[07:25.76]Alright.
[07:26.10]What's first?
[07:26.66]Including a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy VII Remake.
[07:34.93]Haven't they shown a new trailer for this game like the last five years?
[07:37.09]Fake crowd.
[07:37.33]I'm supposed to talk about Minecraft.
[07:38.13]What?
[08:01.96]Best community?
[08:03.53]Oh, okay.
[08:04.37]This is the company that patches their game the most.
[08:11.91]But what if the game is broken and fucked up to begin with?
[08:16.06]Does that make you, I guess, invoke patches?
[08:19.86]It's going to be Fortnite.
[08:21.11]Season 2.
[08:28.48]They were right there.
[08:30.00]Congratulations.
[08:31.46]Thank you very much.
[08:32.24]This is really an honor.
[08:35.21]I got to acknowledge the people at Bungie who've worked so hard to support our community, starting with our community team who are on the front lines every day interacting with our fans, the core development team, our operations folks.
[08:48.18]Everyone up and down just cares so much about this game.
[08:51.22]I just got to acknowledge all their hard work.
[08:53.10]I don't play it, no.
[08:53.84]The only thing I'd add is everyone here creates entertainment, and what use is creating entertainment if you don't have awesome fans?
[08:58.87]So special thanks to our fans.
[09:02.11]That's amazing.
[09:02.71]Well, congratulations again.
[09:03.75]Thank you so much.
[09:05.57]Thank you.
[09:06.01]What?
[09:06.15]Did Reggie play Destiny 2?
[09:07.81]I didn't know it won.
[09:09.69]Huge congratulations to Destiny 2 for winning our first ever Best Community Support Award.
[09:14.38]I'm sure it's no coincidence they are also up for Best Ongoing Games later tonight.
[09:19.26]Now, The Game Awards is a show about celebrating all of gaming, more than just the winners.
[09:24.50]Throughout the night, you'll see unexpected additions to games you love, check-ins on games you're anticipating, and reveals you never saw coming.
[09:32.69]Here's the first of many world premieres.
[09:43.34]I can sense a great cosmic disturbance.
[09:46.05]We must be prepared for the worst.
[09:48.35]Time to change history for the better.
[09:53.43]Oh my god, that was so fucking loud.
[09:56.37]And it was all my fault.
[10:00.76]I'm so sorry, guys.
[10:01.88]That was all my fault.
[10:03.80]I turned it up.
[10:05.62]I turned something up over there.
[10:09.01]That was seriously like somebody just punched you in the face.
[10:11.73]Like, I just punched you in the face.
[10:16.47]Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
[10:20.29]Our first world premiere!
[10:21.91]Didn't this game already come out?
[10:24.81]I thought this game already came out.
[10:37.55]Rise of the feet.
[10:39.79]Oh, no, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
[10:41.05]Right, right, right, right.
[10:41.71]Okay.
[10:43.93]Oh, I got to turn the camera off when that happens.
[10:46.84]In 2018, the Game Awards teamed up with Facebook Gaming to honor global gaming citizens.
[10:51.62]I'm so sorry.
[10:51.98]People from all areas of gaming who use the power of games to create a positive influence.
[10:57.03]Tonight, I'm joined by one of the global gaming citizens we met last year who has a new project to show us.
[11:03.01]Please welcome Luol Mayan.
[11:04.73]Thank you so much.
[11:05.69]Thank you so much.
[11:06.51]Yeah.
[11:08.14]So, Luol, what have you been working on?
[11:10.73]Yeah, for sure.
[11:11.35]You know, as someone from Africa and also as a refugee, I want to thank everybody that has been supporting me to come up with a game today.
[11:19.55]Facebook Gaming, Eisenberg, and Luol Deng.
[11:22.73]I've been working on a game that actually put a player in the shoes of a refugee.
[11:26.63]It's a game that actually talks about journey and helping people to understand the empathy
[11:32.66]And this is something that video game can be able to do around the world.
[11:35.34]We can be able to change the world and help people around the world and see whatever they're going through through playing video game.
[11:42.23]So it's a game really that put a player in the shoes of refugees and bridging the reality world and what is actually happening on the ground.
[11:50.36]So I'm really so excited about the project.
[11:52.30]Incredible.
[11:52.86]Well, let's take a look.
[11:54.14]We got a trailer?
[11:54.96]Why would I turn the camera on for the trailer?
[11:57.47]Games are very powerful to create empathy and to help people understand a journey of a refugee.
[12:02.83]Growing up in a refugee camp, my mother spent three years looking for $300 to buy a computer.
[12:09.01]Then I taught myself how to create video games.
[12:11.69]My mission in creating Salam is to let the world know what it's like to be a refugee.
[12:15.99]When you buy medicine and food in the game, it goes to real refugees, refugees like me.
[12:22.44]Together, we can take small steps to make a big difference.
[12:26.70]What is Facebook Instant Games?
[12:30.50]It's so great to show you games like Salaam.
[12:32.88]We have such a unique opportunity here at the Game Awards to shine our spotlight on games big and small.
[12:38.77]Look forward to seeing some more interesting indies later tonight.
[12:42.71]This next Game Awards category also demonstrates this kind of diversity in gaming.
[12:47.15]The nominees represent completely different budgets, nationalities, and genres, but they all share one thing, excellent music.
[12:55.30]Here are the nominees for best score in music.
[12:58.66]Cadence of Hyrule.
[12:59.59]They're really running.
[13:01.09]They're really sprinting.
[13:02.13]Death Stranding.
[13:04.03]It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3 because of like... It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3.
[13:07.41]Devil May Cry 5.
[13:08.49]It's going to be Kingdom Hearts 3.
[13:11.19]Kingdom Hearts 3.
[13:12.07]Right.
[13:13.99]Listen to that.
[13:15.14]Listen to me.
[13:15.74]And Sayonara Wild Hearts.
[13:19.22]And the winner is... This is unfair though.
[13:24.50]See, even she's like... Death Stranding.
[13:26.54]Oh, shit.
[13:30.25]I was gonna say, it's like Disney songs.
[13:34.06]You can't compete with Let It Go.
[13:35.84]I'm supposed to be talking about Minecraft!
[13:55.15]as versatile as it ended up being.
[13:57.31]I'm just super happy to be here, and I'm super thankful for all the fans who inspired us to do something super weird, and I hope we can keep on doing weird shit going forward.
[14:09.58]Alright, we'll do it after.
[14:10.44]I think we all hope that.
[14:11.82]We only got like 16 minutes.
[14:13.22]I needed like 30 to talk about this.
[14:17.10]For the past two E3s, there's been one game featured in the PC gaming show that continues to fill our imagination with endless possibilities.
[14:25.40]I'm talking, of course, about Maneater, the game where you are a killer shark that eats people.
[14:31.16]If you're hungry for more Maneater, here's a new world premiere.
[14:34.10]What is Maneater?
[14:34.80]This is the first time I've ever heard anyone talk about this.
[14:41.68]Hey, gamers.
[14:42.36]You know that thing that we've never spoken about?
[14:44.69]Here it is.
[14:47.98]But only five humans are killed by sharks.
[14:52.42]It's time to even the score.
[14:54.82]Isn't this game on Newgrounds right now?
[15:05.03]This is a Newgrounds game.
[15:08.27]Eat.
[15:10.83]Maybe I should say... Explore.
[15:17.25]Evolve.
[15:24.87]Can I evolve legs?
[15:26.02]I'll play it if I can get legs and walk around.
[15:28.60]And like get in a car and drive around.
[15:30.10]Alright.
[15:44.55]Stephen Curry will be here tonight to award the best esports player of 2019, but for now, I have the honor of acknowledging the winners for some esports categories.
[15:54.41]For best esports coach, the nominees are Adrian, Kane, Grabs, Koma, Soksha, and Zonic.
[16:08.76]And the winner is Zonic.
[16:13.99]So do we only use handles now?
[16:16.26]The nominees are the 2019 Overwatch League Grand Finals.
[16:19.64]Evo 2019.
[16:19.78]Like in brackets or something.
[16:20.56]Fortnite World Cup.
[16:31.07]League of Legends World Championships.
[16:34.73]2019 Overwatch League.
[16:36.03]I based this on which one of these I actually watched, and I didn't watch any of them.
[16:41.81]I think, no, no, no, I caught like maybe two hours of Evo.
[16:45.51]So Evo.
[16:47.43]League of Legends World Championship 2019.
[16:53.49]For Best Esports Host, the nominees are... How many fans does this game have?

[17:07.15]And the winner is Shox.
[17:08.39]And for best esports team, the nominees are Astralis, G2 Esports, OG, San Francisco Shock,
[17:25.11]You know when the older generation gets old enough and they look back and they go, I don't know what this is?
[17:31.10]I'm in that moment now.
[17:33.28]I mean, I think this is cool as shit, but I don't know any of these things.
[17:35.76]I don't know any of these things.
[17:37.20]I think it's cool shit, though.
[17:38.30]He's a boomer.
[17:50.54]We're about to take a short break, but first, here's a little message from a couple of the stars of Jumanji The Next Level.
[17:57.39]Jumanji?
[17:58.71]What's up, Game Awards?
[17:59.87]What's up, PlayStation?
[18:01.55]We checked out Dreams and got to see the PlayStation version of ourselves.
[18:05.67]It was trippy.
[18:06.85]We're in a game.
[18:08.09]Yeah, no kidding.
[18:09.19]Especially your face.
[18:10.52]It was so handsome.
[18:13.79]That was sculpted in dreams, by the way.
[18:16.01]Oh, that's crazy.
[18:16.43]That's actually insane.
[18:17.17]I'm not going to watch this movie, but... Wait, this is Jumanji's sequel.
[18:21.43]What's coming up next?
[18:43.70]What's the next preview?
[18:57.07]Now these are video games.
[18:59.47]Now this one was good.
[19:00.53]I actually really liked that one.
[19:02.95]That one was... Not so good.
[19:11.54]It was alright.
[19:21.93]He hated it.
[19:22.61]I didn't hate it.
[19:28.32]What's next?
[19:29.20]Why is it so hard for me to kill this man?
[19:36.14]He knew every move of mine before I made it.
[19:40.33]I have him right there.
[19:42.79]Take the shot.
[19:49.02]Welcome back to the Game Awards pre-show.
[19:51.34]This summer, I had the pleasure of joining Jeff to co-host Gamescom opening night live.
[19:56.91]And one of the games we revealed that night was Amplitude Studios' Humankind.
[20:01.47]Here to unveil a new gameplay feature and the first trailer with gameplay, please welcome Jeff Spock.
[20:08.05]Hey, Jeff.
[20:09.21]Hi.
[20:09.71]Thanks, Cindy.
[20:10.58]I'm very excited and kind of terrified to be here.
[20:14.92]I'm here to answer a question we've been hearing constantly since we announced the game this summer.
[20:19.23]And the question is, who am I playing?
[20:21.31]Am I playing a king, a queen, a historical figure, leader of a civilization?
[20:25.07]He knows we're talking about Minecraft, too.
[20:28.06]you the idea is that you're going to create a highly customizable avatar that will evolve visually as you play the game so as you make gameplay decisions as you win achievements as you select cultures and that sort of thing you'll see that evolve on the avatar itself which means that at the end of the game you'll have sort of a a record and a trophy of how you changed humankind um
[20:52.53]We have tons of ideas of where the avatar system can go.
[20:55.05]We're very excited about it.
[20:56.75]But if I talk about them, the programmers will literally disembowel me when I get home.
[21:01.49]So in order to avoid that, we put together a trailer.
[21:04.44]You couldn't have said they'll be angry with me?
[21:08.00]They'll scold me?
[21:09.72]They're going to disembowel me?
[21:12.40]Alright, here we go.
[21:14.02]I'm ready for this.
[21:15.32]This actually sounds like it could be good.
[21:23.82]It all started way back, back to basics.
[21:28.22]Ah, the good old days.
[21:31.02]Gathering, hunting, and, well, back to gathering.
[21:37.67]We switched from a cold to a cool place to settle, and I found the perfect spot for my people.
[21:44.25]At first, it was just a few walls to keep the bears out and the pigs in, but you know how it is.
[21:50.37]One district led to another and it kinda snowballed.
[21:54.97]Now the problem was, the neighbors thought the grass was greener on my side of the fence.
[22:00.60]But we saw them coming from a mile away.
[22:03.50]All I had to do was give the order.
[22:06.16]Their first mistake, bringing infantry to a cavalry fight.
[22:10.87]Next, losing the high ground.
[22:13.63]Final mistake, not keeping up in the arms race.
[22:18.24]But eventually, peace prevailed and we came to an understanding.
[22:22.90]They surrendered, and I let them live.
[22:26.74]It turns out, we had a lot to learn from them.
[22:29.38]And together, we became more than the sum of our parts.
[22:32.75]A unique mix of cultures and beliefs.

[22:59.46]It's been like three and a half weeks since they've added a new game to the Apple Arcade.
[23:02.37]What's going on there?
[23:03.81]I keep checking it and it says nothing there.

[23:51.63]What the fuck?
[23:55.47]20 years, he's back, and he's here to take over the world.

[35:54.86]What's that beautiful?
[35:55.76]Ninja sitting right behind Reggie.
[35:58.20]You know, tonight, one of the things that really amazes me about this show is how we connect the world around games.
[36:04.03]If you're a ninja, do you, do you like, at some point during this thing, when you're like getting up to go to the bathroom, like, I'm gonna get back to my seat.

[36:55.56]Please welcome Jonathan Nolan.
[36:59.55]What?
[36:59.91]Why is Jonathan Nolan here?
[37:07.21]evening I'm here to present the award for best narrative we talk a lot about narrative in westworld where our guest characters choose their own paths with branching storylines that change narrative based on their actions it's an idea that we invented all by ourselves you're welcome by the way I could write circles around everybody here if someone asked just wait till I make my game I saw that year was my my answer as often as not isn't a movie it's not a show it's a game
[37:34.77]Games like Fallout, BioShock, Half-Life, Red Dead Redemption, all hugely influential on our work.
[37:42.94]And you can see the echoes of those games in our show.
[37:46.36]Evan Rachel Wood's character, Dolores, has more than a little in common with Elizabeth in BioShock Infinite.
[37:53.19]James Marsden's character, Teddy, was of course based on James Marsden's character in Sonic the Hedgehog.
[38:01.04]And, of course, I'd be remiss if I failed to mention the debt of honor that Ed Harris' character, the Man in Black, owes to Q-Bert.
[38:08.00]So it's a true honor for me to be here tonight to recognize the amazing, thoughtful, and groundbreaking work in Narrative this year.
[38:16.35]Here are the nominees.

[47:26.36]This year, we've got three new amazing stories about global gaming citizens.
[47:31.06]I'm so proud to have these in the show, and I just can't wait to share them with you tonight.
[47:35.76]Here's our first global gaming citizen.
[47:37.57]I'm not talking.
[47:38.21]Why did somebody just shut up?
[47:39.41]I didn't say anything.
[47:43.09]I was born as an Afghan refugee.
[47:45.91]Growing up with the fear of, am I going to be able to go to school or not, was always with me.
[47:51.30]I'm not able to go back to my country.
[47:56.92]Afghanistan is a very traditional country.
[47:59.98]There is a huge problem here for women accessing education.
[48:05.11]So I decided enough is enough, and I thought about coding.
[48:10.21]Code to Inspire is the first computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan.
[48:15.34]We've developed, so far, more than 20 games.
[48:18.66]Our students told me, we are very tired of playing games that the men are superheroes.
[48:24.24]And it's always pretty white men.
[48:26.48]So I was like, then why don't you just go and create your own game?
[48:30.66]African hero girls when they see the game that they are playing are made by women that's an empowerment itself they understand that they have a voice and they should be heard I have a coffee warmer in here and I just actually hurt myself is it possible that the past and future are colliding in

[61:26.08]Tell us, what's the latest on Warframe?
[61:28.05]We've been making this game for seven years, and each year we update it with Space Ninja Flare, but we think it's time to go Space Pirate, and this whole Empyrean thing is what our community wants to know about.
[61:37.86]Yes, I know.
[61:38.56]You guys have teased that.
[61:40.28]What can you tell us about it?
[61:41.11]When's it going to come out?
[61:41.89]Well, we were thinking on PC.
[61:44.03]What is this?
[61:44.33]We would launch it right now.
[61:45.67]Oh, okay.
[61:46.37]Here we go.
[61:47.07]So Imperium is live right now.
[61:48.41]Alright.
[61:48.61]That's fantastic.
[61:49.56]And people will be able to get their hands on it tonight.
[61:51.80]Anything else that we should be keeping in mind?
[61:53.62]Yeah.
[61:54.06]Our PlayStation 4 and Xbox One 10o have the Rising Tide update, which means we are now preparing for Imperium.
[61:59.33]Yes, I do.
[61:59.71]Switch will come soon.
[62:01.45]I follow Vinny.
[62:03.21]I follow Vinesauce.
[62:04.22]That's bullshit.
[62:07.24]I don't follow literally anyone.
[62:08.94]Where's my stream?
[62:10.62]Where's my stream?
[62:11.46]Alright, who cares about my stream?
[62:12.92]I am co-streaming.
[62:37.65]Anyone.
[62:38.89]I do, though.
[62:39.56]Oh, it's because I'm not logged in to this.
[62:43.68]I'm not logged in.
[62:44.32]This is just a browser plugin.
[62:45.45]Okay, I get it.
[63:27.63]Stop it.
[63:29.59]Tonight we're happy to welcome Samsung as a new partner of the Game Awards and throughout the night you'll be hearing from my fellow Canadian, lots of Canadians tonight, Linus Tech Tips about Samsung's QLED TVs which are optimized for the best gaming experience.
[63:42.82]Take a look.
[63:45.22]I'm Linus from Linus Tech Tips, and I'll be talking about some of the ways living room gaming is better than ever.
[63:51.07]When I was a kid, my first gaming TV was about this big.
[63:55.01]Me too.
[63:55.67]And it had a VHS player built into it.
[63:57.79]Me too.
[63:58.17]Not very immersive.
[63:59.17]With a Samsung QLED TV, not only can you see more than ever before, but at 4K resolution with sizes of up to 82 inches.
[64:07.18]Linus, you're sitting too close.
[64:08.04]The image clarity is unbelievable.
[64:09.54]Linus, sit back.
[64:10.16]You're gonna hurt your eye.
[64:12.44]You can game without worry.
[64:13.84]That's too close.
[64:16.26]See, that just hurt me and I'm like far away and this is like a 25 inch TV.
[64:19.34]I am deaf and I play Fortnite and I'm 14.
[64:23.69]I was a streamer with a very small following.
[64:29.09]In the past 14 months, everything's really taken off and it's been absolutely incredible.
[64:35.35]I mean, I've become the first woman in FaZe Clan
[64:39.56]My goal is to see many more females playing and considered at an equal level.
[64:45.85]And I really want to see that explode in the gaming world.
[64:49.03]I think that would be really nice.
[64:57.95]And he walks here with us tonight.
[64:59.03]We're so glad to have her with us.
[65:00.01]Alright.
[65:00.65]Oh, shit.
[65:01.09]I can vote on this one.
[65:02.17]He's the senior art director for Magic the Gathering.
[65:04.79]Dan, welcome to the Game Awards.
[65:06.22]Thank you.
[65:06.80]Probably no more Heroes 3.
[65:08.38]What's next?
[65:09.94]Well, Jeff, I'm excited to tell you that in January, Magic will be returning to one of our most beloved worlds.
[65:17.84]So the last time we went to Theros, a world of gods, myths, and monsters, we saw our hero, Elspeth Tyrell, my favorite planeswalker,
[65:26.87]betrayed by the gods and banished to walk the underworld.
[65:29.91]But now our hero is ready to defy death and escape her fate.
[65:34.61]And I'm here to give you a sneak peek at what's in store for her.
[65:38.47]Now with music by Ramin Djawadi, this is the trailer for Theros Beyond Death.
[65:44.33]Alright, check it out.
[65:44.97]Watch this trailer.
[65:45.61]I'm gonna run and pee and be right back.
[67:00.30]you
[67:33.56]Alright, I'm back.
[67:41.09]This is probably why I lean into my friend I'm sitting next to at the movie and go, hey, what happened?
[67:44.67]And something fucking major happened, and your friend is just sitting there going, the guy with the green hat came in, and there was a firefight, and I don't know, I couldn't, it was fast.
[67:57.24]Alright, the new game announcements just keep rolling here at the Game Awards.
[67:59.70]Eventually we'll get some games you already know about, but let's keep going with things you haven't seen before.
[68:03.26]Here's another world premiere.
[68:24.88]Why do they do this?
[68:27.34]Yes, we know it's a big movie screen.
[68:31.42]Why do we have to pull out?
[68:32.22]It's almost like to prove how big the screen is.
[68:40.54]What?
[68:43.12]What the fuck was that?
[68:44.20]Now, she's a creative director and the lead art designer from the Evil Within series.
[68:49.58]Please welcome Ikumi Nakamura.
[68:57.03]What was the last thing?
[68:59.17]There were some dogs barking.
[69:02.38]Please bear with my English.
[69:07.22]Okay?
[69:09.42]Good art can change over time.
[69:13.07]But great art stays great.
[69:16.65]Great art stay...
[69:20.18]Great art Sparks joy in our brains and helps us to change the way we think.
[69:30.75]Because sometimes we need to change to survive.
[69:35.47]This year, I had a big change in my life, and it's been a crazy year.
[69:53.31]But I'm alive.
[69:55.81]Was it a crazy year for you?
[70:02.15]You are not alone because I'm here.
[70:04.61]And we have great games with great art.
[70:12.74]Here are the nominees for Best Art Direction are... Mitere!
[70:18.79]Best Art Direction.
[70:22.05]Best Art Direction, presented by Samsung QLED.
[70:26.36]Samsung, you didn't make any of this stuff.
[70:27.78]Please.
[70:45.58]Yeah, Sekiro was... Sekiro did look pretty great.
[70:48.66]It was pretty good.
[70:49.78]Yeah.
[70:50.06]I would say it was probably Sekiro.
[70:55.10]As you know, I am a fortune teller.
[70:58.11]I can see... And... And the winner is... Did she just show it?
[71:12.06]Control!
[71:16.53]Control is amazing.
[71:43.62]I didn't play it.
[71:46.40]Wow.
[71:48.69]This is incredible.
[71:49.53]I'm trying to avoid any explicit language right now.
[71:52.41]Instead of being Sekiro.
[71:57.44]I think the big thank you goes to the art director, Jan Nebulken.
[72:01.76]He is an amazing person.
[72:03.60]Was the art director not there?
[72:04.68]Remedy for a long while.
[72:06.62]And he had this crystal clear vision of what he wanted to achieve with Control.
[72:11.88]And he did amazing things together with his team.
[72:15.24]Also, I have to thank Stuart MacDonald, who is the world design director, and all the characters and all the creepy monsters that existed in this game.
[72:24.30]And I can't imagine a better group of artists, intelligent, creative people to work with.
[72:30.65]And this is thanks to you guys.
[72:32.91]Thank you so much for your work.
[72:36.84]Does control look good?
[72:38.24]I don't even know what control is.
[72:42.54]I know it's like you can manipulate the world with your hands and you have superpowers, right?
[72:46.60]You have superpowers and control between the walls.
[72:49.89]Something like that.
[72:50.49]I don't know.
[72:50.79]Congratulations to the guys at Remedy.
[72:52.91]We've got lots more awards coming up.
[72:54.25]But right now I'm here with Donald Mustard, Worldwide Creative Director for Epic Games.
[72:58.47]Donald, welcome back to the game.
[72:59.51]It's a yearly thing, I feel like.
[73:00.79]Here we go, season three, Fortnite, here it comes.
[73:02.77]Well, you guys have built quite a franchise in Fortnite, and the last couple years have just been
[73:08.49]been so crazy for you guys, but what I love is that you're constantly innovating with this game.
[73:12.66]That's what we're trying to know.
[73:13.58]It's, you know, we think we're all just trying to make stuff that we think is fun, that we think is cool, and you never quite expect something to take off the way that Fortnite did, right?
[73:24.47]But once that momentum happened, we're just like, man, how do we just, we've got to lean in, and how do we find ways to really just push the idea of what a persistent virtual place can be?
[73:36.43]And so that's why even this year,
[73:38.12]We start the year off with a concert that has over 10 million people in it.
[73:44.02]10 million people at a concert?
[73:46.50]Huge monster fights, and we've got... When were there 10 million people at a concert?
[73:51.38]How do we find a way to suck the entire world into the zero-point black hole and turn the game off and all this stuff?
[73:59.07]But that all, in some ways, I think...
[74:01.03]pales in comparison to what's about to happen this weekend.
[74:03.63]Yeah, something pretty cool is going to happen in a few hours, you know, on Saturday.
[74:09.07]On Saturday, you guys probably have seen teasing a little bit about something that's happening at Risky Reels tied to Star Wars.
[74:17.24]Yeah.
[74:17.98]If you do Fortnite VR, isn't it just going to be like this?
[74:19.76]Yes, and it's pretty cool.
[74:21.38]What can you tell us about it?
[74:22.38]Like, don't you have to, like, look down at it?
[74:23.86]I probably can't tell you much, but...
[74:26.94]I have a friend who can.
[74:28.10]Okay.
[74:28.32]Let's take a look.
[74:30.12]How do you do Fortnite VR?
[74:32.23]Thanks, Donald.
[74:33.03]Hey, everyone.
[74:33.61]It's J.J.
[74:34.03]Abrams, director of The Rise of Skywalker.
[74:36.47]Join me in Fortnite on Saturday for an exclusive look at the movie.
[74:40.78]What is he doing here?
[74:41.60]So I'll see you in Fortnite on Saturday.
[74:44.38]Thanks.
[74:47.92]Yeah.
[74:49.55]I see you Saturday for Fortnite.
[74:50.95]And I think, you know, some people online are just like, oh, you're just running a clip or whatever, and I don't know how much you want to reveal, but you and I have been talking all year about, you know, building a live experience around this.
[74:58.61]I'm excited.
[74:58.97]I'm going to get to actually be in the game as well, kind of interacting with JJ.
[75:03.12]And I don't know how much you want to tell us about it, but it's going to be a live participatory experience, right?
[75:07.92]I think it's going to be, like, something that no one's ever seen before, ever.
[75:12.28]I mean, JJ and Jeff, we're going to be live.
[75:14.80]Yes.
[75:17.85]Oh, and that's the glider we're going to get, I think.
[75:19.99]There's also going to be that.
[75:20.95]Exactly.
[75:21.35]Wait, so hold on.
[75:21.99]That's what happens when you do it live, right?
[75:28.24]You never know.
[75:29.42]There's an attack happening.
[75:30.32]Everyone who shows up, as you drop out of the battle bus, you're all going to pop those out.
[75:35.04]Everyone that shows up is going to get TIE Whisperers.
[75:37.54]It's awesome.
[75:38.14]You're flying around.
[75:39.18]And JJ and Jeff will be there live in the game.
[75:43.64]We're going to see this awesome clip from Star Wars.
[75:47.00]It's a brief, but I've seen it many times.
[75:49.38]It's very, very good.
[75:50.72]You want to see it?
[75:53.51]It's my favorite part of Star Wars.
[75:55.09]It's when Han Solo said, Boba Fett!
[75:56.77]Boba Fett!
[75:57.09]That's better.
[75:57.51]Use that one.
[76:04.93]but this is inside the game world.
[76:06.53]I'm really excited about what is going to happen on Saturday.
[76:08.72]So right from the Game Awards to that.
[76:10.90]But before then, I know you've got some other, some cool things that people can pick up in Fortnite, right?

[76:16.42]So there's one more thing.
[76:17.72]So right now, you can go to Fortnite, and these are now available in the game.

[77:14.01]Did they not show it?
[77:14.75]The next one comes from a team up in my home country of Canada.
[77:17.65]I keep mentioning Canada, but this is a game that I think you'll be surprised by.
[77:22.07]I thought he was going to show his favorite Star Wars clip.
[77:23.87]Am I stupid?
[77:35.68]Forever, yup.
[77:40.06]I don't wanna live forever.
[77:42.81]White demons.
[78:05.88]Okay, what the fuck is going on?
[78:37.28]Is that a demon?
[79:02.33]Sons of the Forest.
[79:09.34]Sons of the Forest coming out end night tonight.
[79:17.44]Sons of the Forest.
[79:18.38]We got some cool stuff tonight.
[79:19.56]Alright.
[79:20.02]Well, one of the most played games in the world is League of Legends.
[79:23.73]And tonight we're happy to have Riot and its new Riot Forge division with us to reveal their first single player experience for the franchise.
[79:32.25]What happened to the one that they were making?
[79:33.73]What happened to that Monster Hunter game they were making?
[79:37.87]Is that still going on?
[79:38.75]Did they can that?
[79:41.89]My king.
[79:47.10]Long have you waited.
[79:48.94]Now, the time has come for your revenge.
[80:08.63]Asmodean will reign as the crime.
[80:40.45]Ruin King Airship Syndicate.
[80:42.23]I'm here with Joe Mad.
[80:43.21]Joe, you guys have made some amazing games over the years.
[80:47.25]First of all, congratulations on working with Riot to reveal you guys making the first game, what it is.
[80:52.44]Tell us more about what we just saw in that teaser.
[80:54.36]How do you do single player League of Legends?
[80:55.94]I'm so excited we can finally talk about this.
[80:58.28]I was sure I would leak it before now.
[81:00.46]But we are doing the first ever Riot Forge game.
[81:05.32]And as you saw, it is the Ruin King, a League of Legends story.
[81:10.48]We're basically building on our experience making Battle Chasers and Darksiders to create a story-driven turn-based RPG.
[81:20.31]We have a new take on turn-based combat that's really cool.
[81:23.79]Obviously the visual, the art and visuals that our studio is known for.
[81:27.72]And the story takes place after Burning Tides.
[81:32.42]So everyone believes Gangplank is dead.
[81:35.40]Bilgewater is in chaos, and you'll actually play as some league champions and explore Bilgewater, the Shadow Isles, and we have a lot of other surprises as well, and Poros.
[81:45.71]They're mandatory, apparently.
[81:47.05]Alright, well, it sounds like this is something you've been working on for a little while too, right?
[81:50.87]That's all I can say.
[81:52.01]Did you like the green swooshes and that voice actor?
[81:54.76]I really love the green swooshes.
[82:10.91]So Joe, I don't, I don't get this.
[82:12.77]I don't.
[82:13.33]And it's an industry-wide thing.
[82:15.28]I will.
[82:15.68]I'm good right now.
[82:16.98]Thank you very much, Joe.
[82:18.32]Great announcement.
[82:19.24]Legal action.
[82:19.76]Fantastic.
[82:20.28]There's a guy that talks over like 12 seconds.
[82:23.22]It's like what?
[82:24.02]Just...
[82:25.07]When we come back, a performance by Grimes.
[82:28.21]The award for best action game with Norman Reedus and a special announcement from an Apex legend.
[82:34.82]Still to come, Ninja presents best multiplayer game and an extended look at Ghost of Tsushima.
[82:41.20]What happens during the break?
[82:42.80]Don't go anywhere.
[82:46.97]What is the break?
[82:49.29]Ladies and gents,
[82:55.50]We've been here training for weeks.
[83:02.99]Okay, that's pretty good.
[83:04.29]Hold on, that's pretty good.
[83:05.57]What?
[83:06.19]I love you.
[83:06.83]Of course you do, snookers.
[83:08.49]Now quit messing around.
[83:09.51]Let's give these people what they want.
[83:24.59]Wait, didn't they... didn't they delete this?
[83:28.47]I thought that Suicide Squad... they deleted it.
[83:30.43]And then the very end, right when it says coming 2020, you hear...
[83:59.57]Where is it?
[83:59.95]What did I just save it to?
[84:14.70]Wait, you want to like see what's going on on the screen.
[84:22.82]Oh, we just have to watch a bunch of ads.
[84:30.00]Over 75 awards and nominations.
[84:32.10]Oh, this is Doom Doom.
[84:53.57]Lots of stuff coming out in March, huh?
[84:54.85]Ditch vape.
[85:18.08]I'm vaping right now.
[85:19.32]You need to cut that shit up.
[85:21.04]Stop doing that.
[85:22.37]I'm looking you right in the eyes.
[85:23.93]Stop doing that.
[85:26.71]What are you doing that for?
[85:29.85]Don't eat a banana.
[85:33.22]Just eat a banana.
[85:34.54]Don't do anything else.
[85:35.93]You could eat bananas, you could eat bananas for every meal.
[85:38.95]And then like smear some peanut butter, spoon side up, just on the roof of your mouth and swallow it.
[85:43.73]You'll be fine.
[85:53.65]I remember that level, that level sucked.
[86:00.99]You shouldn't have given me that image.
[86:02.35]Alright, I have to stop talking in mute because people will literally scream at me if they...
[86:26.68]Even in the dystopian future, hard rap lives on.
[86:29.30]We want to provide you with the soundtrack to fucking shit up.
[86:33.02]I mean, we're not here as refuse.
[86:35.57]We're here as samurai.
[86:36.61]It's a very interesting thing to be part of.
[86:39.05]We really work on these songs, trying to make them as good as possible.
[86:42.29]I think my music fits with my city because both are scary and pretty at the same time.
[86:47.21]My music will be featured in Cyberpunk 2077.
[86:49.39]I'm super excited.
[86:53.16]It's quite rebellious, and it's quite noisy and aggressive.
[86:56.12]I think industrial is the word.
[86:58.90]I can't wait to see how the two worlds actually meet.
[87:01.64]I mean, it's been a lot of fun playing these beats.
[87:04.54]It's very punk rock, in a way, in its approach.
[87:06.64]They're building these systems to make really rugged, rough, edgy music.
[87:10.36]Psychedelic, trippy, yet lifting and engaging.
[87:14.68]And you can see a lot of kind of industrial stuff and revolution happening.
[87:18.81]Sort of mixing punk music and, like, what electronic music could be in the future.
[87:23.31]So we have some tracks that are super dirty, super heavy, and then we have some tracks that are very beautiful and ambient.
[87:29.83]That was just a glimpse of what we have in store for you.
[87:32.42]See you in Night City.
[87:41.54]I promise I won't do it again.
[87:51.17]Oh, I gotta stay up.
[87:56.91]Don't your punctuation hit the sky.
[88:18.76]Fuck, I'm not supposed to... I'm deleting it off my OBS.
[88:58.83]Oh, it's Cyberpunk.
[89:01.55]Right.
[89:12.65]Wait, you're doing Wolverine?
[89:14.39]You're gonna get in and do Wolverine?
[89:15.79]This is how Wolverine was created.
[89:18.85]Don't do it!
[89:19.35]Don't do it!
[89:30.41]Weapon X. Into the vape coffin.
[89:35.81]Into the vape coffin.
[89:44.86]This is the future.
[89:46.10]Cyberpunk 2020.
[89:47.80]You put on your gamer headset and your gamer glasses and your VR and you lie down in the fucking vape chamber.
[89:56.73]I have an IV of like gamer fuel and Doritos and shit.
[90:10.38]I love it.
[90:11.00]I'd love that.
[90:12.28]I'd love the baked coffee.
[90:18.98]And every time you sneeze, blood fucking shoots out of your nose.
[90:22.80]That's what it's going to be like.
[90:24.36]People are like, oh, the future.
[90:25.94]It's going to be so interesting.
[90:26.96]No, no, no, no.
[90:27.50]Every sneeze, blood's going to spray.
[90:29.32]Blood spray out of your nose every time in the future.
[90:37.72]Shut up.
[90:37.92]I'm trying to hear the subpar music.
[90:44.97]Why is he standing?
[90:47.36]Why are you standing?
[90:48.22]What is going on?
[90:52.35]The camera's on me.
[90:53.69]And now, Lisa Scott is a walking dead and a best performance nominee tonight for his role as Sam Porter Bridges in Death Stranding.
[91:01.77]He was so torrent.
[91:03.93]He's like, do I stand?
[91:04.87]I don't mind when I stand.
[91:06.07]I guess I'll stand.
[91:06.99]Hello.
[91:10.26]What's up?
[91:10.60]He did that thing.
[91:11.30]He did that face.
[91:12.10]Hi.
[91:12.42]Alright, it's time to present the award for best action game.
[91:17.21]These games are all wildly different.
[91:20.31]Some new franchises, some beloved sequels, all with their own unique adversaries and objectives.
[91:26.81]But the one thing that they have in common is that they set the bar for lively combat and thrills.
[91:33.48]Alright, ready?
[91:34.28]Alright, alright, alright.
[91:36.96]Alright, here's the nominees.
[91:39.40]That's like hair game.

[91:41.58]No, that's hair goals.
[91:42.74]Here I keep up.
[91:46.74]How am I doing?
[91:54.61]That kicks some ass.
[91:57.57]Jerma, you didn't play this game.
[91:59.83]You can't jump.
[92:00.37]You didn't play that.
[92:01.19]Alright, I won't.

[92:38.62]You're being smug.
[92:40.15]I didn't play this game.
[92:43.91]I didn't play the game.
[92:44.67]I know it was good.
[92:46.75]Thank you so much for all the fans who have been supporting us.
[92:49.05]And thank you so much for waiting 11 years for the sequel.
[93:08.76]I was really happy to stick with my roots and try to make as pure of an action game as possible.
[93:12.55]Thank you!
[93:30.41]Yeah, I can say that again.
[93:35.43]Congrats to the DMC guys.
[93:37.15]Alright, I'm now joined by Jeff Haddam, the studio lead and founder of Tuke Games from Canada.
[93:42.52]I don't know how it all works out that way, but a lot of cat.
[93:44.72]Grimes, Canadian, Jeff.
[93:45.90]Alright, anyways, tell us what you're working on up at Tuke.
[93:48.66]Thanks, Jeff.
[93:49.28]I'm super excited to be here with the world premiere of the game we've been working on up in Montreal.
[93:53.76]Salut tout le monde.
[93:55.69]When we started working on this game, we had the idea to put action back in action RPG.
[94:01.47]And what better place than in Dungeons & Dragons?
[94:05.08]I want less action.
[94:07.27]Am I fucking crazy?
[94:09.63]I want less action in my action RPGs.
[94:11.53]Too much shit happens on the screen.
[94:16.42]I don't want a bunch of shit on the screen.
[94:18.46]A bunch of explosions and action every second.
[94:21.06]I like it when it's slowed down a little.
[94:24.63]I don't want more action.
[94:25.61]I want less action.
[94:37.73]Why do they have the, like, fear factor cameras when they're in the haunted house?
[95:01.89]I'm going to put the action back in Action RPG.
[95:04.97]We're also going to put the camera somewhere else, too.
[95:09.63]We want you to be right up in their faces, right in the action, right in their face.
[95:13.26]Alright, up next is the award for the absolute best... Hello?
[95:29.69]It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[95:34.92]Wow, I was a little pitchy on that one.
[95:36.10]I should keep practicing.
[95:38.84]Looks like it's Mirage, everybody.
[95:40.62]What's up, Mirage?
[95:41.74]Hey, Keeley, my man.
[95:43.06]What's going on?
[95:44.26]Well, we're kind of in the middle of the Game Awards right now.
[95:46.68]And this guy, like, attached to walls and stuff?
[95:48.75]Oh, is that tonight?
[95:49.61]Tell me, tell me.
[95:50.57]Did I already win for best all-around competitor in a battle royale based on skills but mostly good looks?
[95:56.79]That is such a specific award, and as I told you on Twitter, it does not exist.
[96:00.03]I hope it gets cut off by the pre-recorded footage.
[96:01.53]I'm sorry, Mirage.
[96:03.27]Oh, okay, okay.
[96:04.06]I see what you're doing, keeping the mystery alive for the audience.
[96:06.86]I get it.
[96:07.28]It's a secret award I get later.
[96:10.38]Wink.
[96:11.08]It's not like I haven't been practicing my acceptance speech.
[96:13.88]Wow, these things are really heavy.
[96:16.36]I'd like to thank my mother for my exceptional good looks.
[96:19.83]Mirage, we have a show.
[96:21.33]We've got lots of announcements to get to.
[96:23.55]Is there a purpose of today's call?
[96:25.30]Oh, right.
[96:25.82]Well, I know everybody's always asking for more Mirage content because, well, obviously.
[96:30.68]And I think I speak for everyone when I say we've all had enough of crypto.
[96:34.32]So, Keeley, I'm here tonight to just give the people what they want.
[96:37.80]Oh, a decentralized way to a mutual credit system?

[98:43.81]Hog train.
[98:45.73]Let's do this.
[98:46.99]Hog train?
[98:49.53]Enemy down.
[98:50.19]Target spotted.
[98:53.01]It's called the hog train?
[99:01.21]Watson, Watson, get in here with me.
[99:02.27]Let's take an elfie.
[99:05.15]Why are you looking at me that way?
[99:20.57]Up next, Dr. Bunsen, Honeydew, and Beaker present Games for Impact.
[99:25.92]Plus, Reggie is here, and he's ready.
[99:29.40]Oh, that's gonna be great.
[99:30.74]We're getting a Bunsen and Beaker presentation.
[99:38.42]We're getting a Muppets presentation.
[99:39.80]Alright, I gotta be quiet for this one.
[99:48.19]Is this in Fortnite?
[99:50.58]They're adding every sport to Fortnite?
[100:12.53]Yeah, we really decided we wanted to add a full 9v9 baseball.
[100:29.23]There you go.
[100:29.81]Apple Arcade at the Game Awards for the first time.
[100:31.97]Ultimate Rivals.
[100:32.91]Alright, we have so much more show coming up.
[100:35.63]I don't like that service.
[100:37.27]Because I bought it.
[100:38.07]And there's only... Okay, this is going to sound really fucked up and pretentious and shitty.
[100:41.14]I can't talk because we have to...
[101:14.23]Holy shit, they added Ori and the Blind Forest to Fortnite.
[101:16.98]That's pretty cool.
[101:19.25]How many players are on each map?
[101:43.43]Play it with Xbox Game Pass.
[101:47.59]My favorite thing about being a game designer is I didn't have to pick one subject to specialize in.
[101:53.90]I'm able to just follow my interests and spend lots of time studying galactic evolution or urban planning or technology, whatever it is.
[102:04.94]And then I just kind of turned that into a toy, into a game.
[102:07.31]Part of my job is just enjoying exploring the world and letting my interests take me wherever they go.
[102:13.94]And there are not too many jobs that I think let you do that.
[102:18.24]This is like a...
[102:21.16]When it comes to upping your competition level, there's no doubt that more frames per second makes a measurable difference.
[102:26.96]Trust me.
[102:27.60]That's why Samsung's latest QLED TVs feature native support for games running at up to 120 frames per second with very low input lag and this sweet auto game mode that detects when you're gaming and turns off any extra image processing.
[102:42.54]They've even got AMD FreeSync for smoother animations when the frame rate dips.
[102:46.79]Edit it onto the screen.
[102:50.76]The war had just started when I arrived to Iraq.
[102:53.78]We did our thing.
[102:55.18]We had some experiences.
[102:56.68]And when we came back, when we got off that plane, before we could even embrace our loved ones, our fire team leader says, do not tell anybody what happened to you or what you saw or what you experienced.
[103:10.03]That starts the stigma of mental health.
[103:15.41]Stack Up is a military charity supporting US and allied veterans' mental health through gaming.
[103:20.46]Overwatch is our newest program and it is simply having a chat client up.
[103:24.59]Somebody comes in and says they need to talk or they're interested to get into a game, we have somebody available for them.
[103:32.79]They may not want to come out there and see a counselor for an hour, you know, once a week, but they may come out there and play a video game and start talking about their experiences of war or the struggles that they're having right now.
[103:47.01]It has become my passion to end the stigma of mental health.
[103:55.82]Please welcome two of the most innovative visionaries in the history of gaming.
[104:00.42]I can't wait to see this one.
[104:01.24]And just about everything else.
[104:03.28]From Muppet Labs, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker.
[104:07.99]How are we?
[104:08.67]How are we on each other's TVs?
[104:11.35]Greetings fellow gaming enthusiasts.
[104:13.61]It's great to be here at the Game Awards.
[104:16.49]I am Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and this is my assistant Beaker.
[104:21.40]Beaky, where did you go?
[104:24.26]Oh, um, I guess he's stuck in the lobby.
[104:30.20]Nothing?
[104:31.07]Oh, well.
[104:32.67]In just a few moments, we will reveal the winner of Games for Impact.
[104:36.99]But first, I was hoping to... Oh, here's Beaky now.
[104:40.13]He's in VR.
[104:41.11]Oh, good to see you.
[104:44.56]Hey, Marvel.
[104:45.95]I forgot we have a basement.
[104:48.89]Beaky, I'm so glad you're here wearing VR goggles to demonstrate our brand new game.
[104:56.06]Yes.
[104:57.26]As you can see, Beaker is wearing Muppet Lab's proprietary next generation technology, VR super gluey goggles.
[105:05.89]You can put them on, but you can't get them off.
[105:13.47]And now we will premiere the exciting new Muppet Labs game.
[105:17.71]Oh, Beaker.
[105:19.31]Beaker.
[105:19.57]That sounds funny.
[105:20.69]That's terrifying.
[105:22.34]What are we calling it?
[105:27.08]Of course.
[105:28.58]The Untitled Beaker Game.
[105:32.05]Excellent choice.
[105:33.11]Let the game begin.
[105:39.70]Play this.
[105:40.65]Watch out for the duck.
[106:11.05]What does Norman Reedus have to think?
[106:15.23]Oh, well.
[106:16.45]Um, here are the nominees for Games for Impact, recognizing socially conscious and progressive games in the industry.
[106:25.44]Roll the nominees.
[106:27.94]Games for Impact.
[106:31.92]You want me to paint this whole town?
[106:52.29]Why is it so dark?
[106:56.79]I played Life is Strange 1.
[106:57.73]Does Life is Strange 2 have magic in it?
[106:59.61]And the winner is...
[107:04.50]What are you doing outside the game?
[107:05.94]Uh, you just, please, hey, hey!
[107:08.72]Give that back to me!
[107:09.52]Beaker, get him!
[107:10.50]Get him, Beaker!
[107:12.30]Oh, no, that's me!
[107:13.62]That's me, Beaker!
[107:15.53]Where did he go?
[107:16.11]Where did he go?
[107:17.65]Uh, where is he?
[107:18.77]Oh, get him!
[107:19.29]He's behind you!
[107:24.63]There.
[107:26.17]You've got him under control?
[107:27.13]Alright.
[107:28.89]Okay, okay.
[107:30.37]Thank you, Beaker.
[107:33.66]I don't care if I'm a two-year-old.
[107:34.94]This is cute.
[107:35.96]Hold his beak shut.
[107:37.76]Hold his beaker.
[107:38.84]That's it.
[107:39.24]Get him.
[107:39.66]Get him.
[107:40.42]Good.
[107:41.78]Sorry about that, folks.
[107:43.52]The award for games for... Would you... Have you got it?
[107:50.42]Bite his nose.
[107:51.06]Bite his nose.
[107:52.82]Bite his nose.
[107:55.16]Stop it.
[107:56.92]Alright.
[107:59.06]The award for Games for Impact goes to... No, not geese.
[108:06.18]Breeze!
[108:07.08]Breeze!
[108:15.25]I really wanted to really... I wanted to start fighting big as, like, neck and face and shit.
[108:25.48]I hope...
[108:26.85]Wonderful.
[108:27.73]Congratulations.
[108:28.85]Thank you to the Muppets.
[108:35.17]Well, we want to share this award with, first of all, Konrad, our creative director, with all the team back at home.
[108:41.88]We made a really good team and we could have never made it without them.
[108:45.10]We have to thank Devolver for allowing us to do the game we wanted to make.
[108:50.14]Yes, well, first of all, I mean, I would like to thank especially to all those people that share their stories with us.
[108:55.17]They send really, really moving stories when they were playing Greece.
[108:58.77]That's something that obviously when you create a game, you try to do these kind of things, but you never know you're going to get to someone.
[109:04.26]And we pretty much are so moved when we receive these stories.
[109:07.94]So please keep sharing it with us because it's amazing.
[109:10.64]And thank you everybody that play and support Greece.
[109:12.44]Thank you very much.
[109:14.15]That's a good idea.
[109:23.77]Alright.
[109:24.55]Thanks to Bunsen and Beaker.
[109:26.13]Lifelong dream to have them here at the show.
[109:28.22]That was a good bit.
[109:29.76]I like that.
[109:30.04]I also want to mention something called the Game Festival.
[109:31.76]I don't know if you heard about that online, but we're launching a new thing tied to the game where it's called the Game Festival.
[109:35.76]And the vision for that is to give all of you around the world who watch this show, you watch trailers, you love games, a chance to play a bunch of games.
[109:42.67]And this year we're partnering with Steam.
[109:44.65]And if you head to Steam for the next 48 hours, a little bit less than that since it started this morning, we have first look demos of over a dozen upcoming games that you can play for free online.
[109:53.01]on Steam, and I think that's kind of the future where this all goes.
[109:55.46]Bringing demos back?
[109:55.96]Not necessarily these local events where you have to travel somewhere to play a game, but actually bringing games into your homes and the places you work and live to play.
[110:04.35]So play all those games.
[110:05.65]The Game Festival concludes Saturday at 10 a.m.
[110:08.29]Pacific, and next year we're going to do it across all the platforms.
[110:10.29]I don't know why they went away in the first place.
[110:12.01]So we're looking forward to doing more with that.
[110:14.02]Alright, well now we're going to present some more awards and let's get into the best family game.
[110:19.47]The nominees for that category are Luigi's Mansion 3.
[110:24.12]Ring Fit Adventure, Super Mario Maker 2, Super Smash Bros.
[110:29.38]Ultimate, and Yoshi's Crafted World.
[110:33.14]It's just best Nintendo games.
[110:35.50]And the game award goes to Luigi's Mansion 3.
[110:40.66]Why even have this category?
[110:42.98]Why don't you just have an ad up here that just says buy Nintendo games for families?
[110:48.42]And those nominees are Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled,
[110:53.67]announced last year at the Game Awards.
[110:55.11]Dirt Rally 2.0, eFootball, Pro Evolution Soccer 2020, F1 2019, and FIFA 20.
[110:57.05]And the Game Award goes to... Crash Team Racing Nitro Fuel.
[110:58.71]Okay.
[111:11.51]And for the best mobile game, the nominees are... Call of Duty Mobile, Grindstone, Sayonara Wild Hearts, which we announced last year, Sky Children of the Light, and What the Golf?
[111:23.86]And the game award in that category goes to... Call of Duty Mobile.
[111:28.45]Congratulations, guys.
[111:31.71]Alright.
[111:32.23]Well, now I'd like to welcome the co-creators of Dishonored and Prey.
[111:36.80]Raf and Julian are here.
[111:37.98]You may have seen online that they just announced their brand new studio, WolfEye, and said here at the Game Awards they were going to reveal their first game.
[111:44.94]So guys, welcome to the Game Awards.
[111:46.68]You've been here before, but you've got this new studio.
[111:48.94]So tell me a bit about WolfEye.
[111:51.00]What's different about it?
[111:51.86]So, well, we took a long break, but it looks like we can't stay away from making games for very long.
[111:56.50]So we're just back at it now with WolfEye.
[111:58.74]Yeah.
[111:59.36]Well, what can you tell us about the game?
[112:00.98]We know the studio.
[112:01.62]We don't know anything about the game, but that's going to change now, right?
[112:03.78]Yeah.
[112:04.16]So you've mentioned Dishonored and Prey as some of our past games.
[112:09.02]We have passion for interesting worlds to explore.
[112:13.10]We have passion for depth of interactivity.
[112:16.14]And of course, we have passion for simulation in general.
[112:18.84]So this new game has all of these values.
[112:21.38]But this time, we have a bit of a different approach.
[112:26.46]a glimpse to show you through a teaser.
[112:28.89]I'm pretending.
[112:29.71]It's amazing.
[112:30.77]One of my favorite programs to show tonight.
[112:32.41]It looks incredible.
[112:33.13]You're going to see the real game here.
[112:34.79]Guys, we can't wait to hear more about this.
[112:36.53]Let's take a look.
[112:37.47]What do you do?
[112:38.87]Oh, nice.
[112:40.62]I was pretending.
[112:41.74]You can call me out on that.
[112:52.75]The West.
[112:54.39]The land of opportunity.
[112:57.93]The place where you can be a hero, a scoundrel, and anything in between.
[113:04.83]This ain't quite the Wild West as you know it.
[113:10.82]There are ancient powers at war with each other.
[113:13.40]Strange entities lurking in the dead of night with their own rules and their own peculiar motives.
[113:23.29]Welcome to the Weird West.
[113:26.24]Weird West.
[113:27.26]Wacky West.
[113:57.62]Alright, action RPG or... What's with the on the phone late at night talking that that was?
[114:01.54]Or I just woke up in the morning.
[114:03.68]Check out this announcement.
[114:36.45]Fire fists?
[114:38.77]Spiders?
[114:39.29]What else?
[115:19.97]Magic Legends.
[115:24.59]Magic... Firefox?
[115:27.09]What was that?
[115:27.65]Magic Legends.
[115:28.65]Bring back the Muppets.
[115:49.44]I want the Muppets to come back.
[115:51.52]Can the Muppets just present every award?
[116:02.44]What?
[116:02.88]What Stadia?
[116:04.38]Stadia is only the newest, most logic-defying, mind-bending, absurd gaming platform on Earth.
[116:09.86]I'll take conversations that will never happen for 100 places.
[116:14.19]And this electric air is Stadia.
[116:20.05]Unlike consoles, Stadia doesn't take up any space.
[116:24.93]It makes no noise.
[116:26.11]It has no smell.
[116:27.35]Watch.
[116:27.93]Go find Stadia, boy.
[116:31.54]You'll never find it.
[116:32.90]Okay.
[116:33.40]You can play Stadia with this.
[116:35.85]Stadia likes to party.
[116:36.99]Up to 4K, 60 FPS.
[116:49.13]Stadia is gaming for free-range humans.
[117:01.13]Stadia travels across screens.
[117:05.15]No downloads, no updates, no waiting.
[117:07.86]Stadia bids time and space to take you straight to your game.
[117:10.84]So Stadia's the...
[117:13.82]Technically this is Stadia.
[117:15.95]Stadia's streaming pipeline leverages decades of Google research.
[117:19.06]Is that a dog?
[117:26.43]But so does every other plat- It doesn't matter.
[117:29.15]That's what I don't get.
[117:31.13]Stadia has the games you're looking for.
[117:33.21]So does PlayStation 4, so does PlayStation 5, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch.
[117:36.39]I don't care.
[117:38.73]I can download a game on Switch.
[117:40.69]And it won't have like .4 seconds of input delay.
[117:44.45]I don't get- I don't understand what this is here for.
[117:46.43]And I actually have a theory.
[117:47.75]That Stadia- They know that it's not good enough.
[117:51.48]But in 10 years, maybe the internet will get to a point where they'll be the first movers when everything is like 7G.
[117:57.59]They'll be here.
[117:57.93]That's a 10-year play for them, I think.
[117:58.83]We've already lost 20% of the Amazon due to fires and deforestation.
[118:14.22]And the Amazon is critical to protecting us from the devastating effects of climate change.
[118:18.60]Thanks to PUBG Mobile and their commitment to harness the power of gaming for good.
[118:22.89]And thanks to all of you, we are starting to make a real difference.
[118:26.57]Global Green's local partners on the ground can now help put out some of the fires and plant thousands of new trees in the Amazon.
[118:34.62]But this isn't the end.
[118:36.22]It's just the beginning.
[118:37.36]The next generation is depending on us.
[118:40.56]Go to globalgreen.org forward slash fightfortheamazon and donate to continue the fight.
[118:50.88]Fight for the Amazon.
[118:56.55]Uh... Nintendo Switch has fights to win.
[119:04.29]Oh, by the way, I played Luigi's Mansion for like an hour or two.
[119:07.37]I could never play that game for more.
[119:08.85]I can't do it.
[119:09.29]I can't play it.
[119:10.39]I will never play Luigi's Mansion 3 ever.
[119:13.14]And we can talk about this.
[119:14.04]I'll try to go as quick as I can.
[119:19.12]Luigi's Mansion 3.
[119:19.86]The vacuum cleaner mechanic.
[119:22.99]I have to suck up everything.
[119:24.67]I cannot leave a single room unless every single fucking object is in that vacuum.
[119:29.39]I can't play the game.
[119:33.65]It takes me hours.
[119:39.03]I played the game for probably two and a half hours and I got through maybe the first five
[119:53.40]Truth is a program that can help it's called.
[119:55.08]This is quitting.
[119:56.12]It's free anonymous text-based available any time of day right on your phone And then a text to the program text you to stop but you don't to do it alone visit the truth
[120:11.43]Vape coffin.
[120:15.13]Hey, it's Trevor here with the vape coffin.
[120:54.33]I feel like the bar fighting game was like a better version of that somehow What's this for?
[120:58.09]What's this for?
[121:11.43]Hello, everyone.
[121:12.57]Thank you guys so much for obviously being here.
[121:14.67]I've been playing video games my entire life, and there's something magical about a solo player experience, and the only way to enhance that is to play games with your friends.
[121:25.27]I've literally defined my entire career by playing online multiplayer games, and here are the nominees for the best multiplayer game of the year.
[121:33.76]Best multiplayer game.
[122:00.38]If you did the Coke and Pepsi test with me, and you put me in half of those games on this list...
[122:05.51]Blindfold and just put me in.
[122:07.09]I don't know if I'd be able to tell you what one I was playing.
[122:09.15]The game award for best multiplayer game goes to... It's a lot more difficult to open up than you think.
[122:17.88]Apex Legends.
[122:21.40]Tetris.
[122:21.76]Alright, blindfold me.
[122:23.60]Let's see.
[122:24.66]I don't know.
[122:25.30]I could be in a... This is like VR.
[122:36.43]Tetris lost.
[122:40.56]Yeah.
[122:40.72]But Tetris is also like 60 years old.
[122:44.26]They didn't have game awards when Tetris came out.
[122:47.94]That's the real sad part.
[122:49.28]They should do a retroactive game award.
[122:57.22]I'd just like to thank the team at Respawn of crazy, passionate, super talented individuals for going with us on this crazy journey.
[123:04.33]We changed our genre, we changed our business model, we made our first character-based game, and we changed IPS while we were shipping a AAA shooter.
[123:12.04]So, thank you, I love you guys.
[123:26.10]At the end of that, all he had to do was go like this.
[123:27.88]Congratulations to Respawn.
[123:30.12]Great to see Apex winning best multiplayer game.
[123:32.62]Now, this year, TikTok has swept the nation with its hashtag challenges.
[123:35.88]The past few weeks, fans have been celebrating gaming on TikTok with over 450 million views so far.

[124:04.42]You can go vote now, and we'll see who you think is going to take home the Game Award in just a bit.
[124:09.38]But right now, let's talk about a big PlayStation 4 title that's coming next year from the guys at Sucker Punch.
[124:17.19]Ghost of Tsushima.
[124:18.47]You probably saw this teased earlier this week.
[124:20.35]I am so excited about this game and what Sucker Punch is bringing to life.
[124:24.13]We have our longest world premiere on the show tonight as I've been saying.
[124:27.61]A true cinematic look.
[124:29.29]Enjoy.
[124:29.81]Why is it not coming out on the PS5?
[124:32.08]Why is it not coming out on the PS5?
[124:33.14]Why is it not coming out?
[124:36.26]It's been in development for like seven years, guys.
[125:12.92]Samurai!
[125:13.62]Hey, you rude orphan!
[126:01.72]That was really powerful.
[126:08.16]Some say he died on the beach.
[126:15.52]Others say he is a storm made to flash when the wind flashes their tents and boats.
[126:53.06]As a weapons export half of this stuff is not even possible Tell him I'm coming
[127:43.98]Are we getting Final Fantasy VII'd here?
[127:45.40]I feel like I've seen this.
[128:09.38]The leaves are... Oh, that's a bad idea.
[128:11.39]The leaves are going to stop blowing around and, like, hitting people in the face.
[128:13.99]People are going to find them in their hair.
[128:21.91]Right now, somebody has a big, like, 7-up.
[128:25.34]No, 7-11.
[128:25.86]A big 7-11 Big Gulp, and one's going to fall right in it.
[128:30.58]It could be 7-up in there.
[128:31.64]7-11 Big Gulp
[128:53.50]Imagine drinking a Big Gulp at the VGAs.
[128:58.05]What's so wrong with that?
[129:01.75]Guys, I got news for you.
[129:02.81]If I ever go to the VGAs, I'm going like this.
[129:05.16]And I'm going to have a fucking, like, 47-ounce Big Gulp.
[129:13.56]I'm going to have big sunglasses on.
[129:15.76]Like, I just got out of the eye doctor.
[129:17.40]And I'm going to be sitting there like... The Game Awards Orchestra.
[129:19.96]Let's give it up for our incredible conductor tonight, Max Arouge of the Game Awards Orchestra.
[129:26.65]They'll be back later for an incredible montage celebrating our Game of the Year nominees.
[129:32.21]And Game of the Year will be presented by some very special guests.
[129:35.00]Surprise guests, so stay tuned for that.
[129:36.74]But right now, we've got another world premiere.
[129:39.28]A look at Gears Tactics.
[129:41.08]Check it out.
[129:48.81]They came for us.
[129:50.42]They invaded every part of our world.
[129:54.30]So we did the only thing we could.
[129:57.72]We set the world on fire.
[130:03.98]Now my war begins against the monster that created these monsters.
[130:08.79]The mon- the Monstars.
[130:11.81]The Monstars!
[130:13.31]And it's time to go hunting.
[130:15.55]That was good.
[130:29.33]Come see what my newest creation thinks of your little plan.
[130:39.60]A long ass time.
[130:57.24]Just once, I want a game company to just blatantly, full on, fucking lie in their text as much as they lie in their gameplay footage.
[131:08.39]600 hour long campaign.
[131:10.74]Just like we planned it.
[131:21.07]Alright, let's turn back to Twitch.
[131:22.53]We asked Twitch to predict the winner for the best ongoing game category, and they chose Final Fantasy XIV.
[131:29.22]We will find out when we present that award in a little bit.
[131:32.32]That's only 27%.
[131:33.12]That must have been close.
[131:33.92]It's going to rock the house by Green Day.
[131:41.61]27%.
[131:41.65]Multiplayer melee combat game.
[131:42.77]I feel like that's every game.
[132:25.10]All footage captures at Gary's house
[132:53.57]Or, all footage will be deleted.
[133:01.19]Or, do not reupload this.
[133:03.50]Copyright.
[133:04.22]You know, anything like that.
[133:28.96]Welcome to Magic School.
[133:31.12]Now that we've covered flying, let's talk about giant angels.
[133:36.08]Not to be confused with bird people.
[133:38.72]Bird people are their own thing.
[133:40.90]Play Magic the Gathering Rune.
[133:42.69]Download free.
[133:44.15]Free?
[133:46.21]A masterpiece.
[133:47.53]How many years have I waited for this moment?
[133:52.09]Hallmark of excellence.
[133:53.13]For the one that stood alone against the storm.
[133:58.97]for the one they called the Warrior of Light.
[134:05.66]Is this the one that won?
[134:13.79]Just drop the numbers from Final Fantasy, it's getting so fucking confusing.
[134:24.44]Just drop the numbers.
[134:26.60]Just drop the numbers.
[134:27.68]Just start doing colons.
[134:39.09]Final Fantasy XIX X1V2214.
[134:44.32]Just start making up other fucking titles.
[134:51.58]I made this tweet like five years ago, but like, when you have more numbers than the Jason movies...
[134:58.41]Like, it's time to change it.
[134:59.92]My game's called Let's Be Well, and it's made with the Roblox Studio game engine.
[135:04.22]It starts off all gray.
[135:06.58]This guy, it says he's depressed.
[135:09.64]As he plays the obstacle course, he learns about the depression.
[135:13.45]This is to get people talking so they don't bottle their feelings up.
[135:19.33]I was pregnant with our youngest son, and my late husband got very, very sick.
[135:27.40]The doctors called it a major depressive episode.
[135:29.96]His mental illness overtook him by way of suicide, and so we lost him when Luke was two years old at the time.
[135:37.77]It's kind of hard to explain, like how my dad died when I was very young.
[135:42.05]I just wanted to spread a positive message that it's okay to talk about mental illness.
[135:47.91]I hope I've helped people.
[135:56.63]Now, she's a host and producer for IGN.
[135:59.95]Please welcome Sydney Goodman.
[136:09.01]I'm here to present the award for best ongoing game.
[136:12.54]Recognizing that we will be playing our favorite games year after year, and acknowledging the teams that keep these massively popular franchises fresh with new content, more experiences, and evolving ways to play.
[136:26.45]Here are the nominees.
[136:28.43]I thought we just did this.
[136:29.53]Best ongoing game.
[136:38.27]I feel like we're seeing the same category?
[136:46.94]Fortnite, Call of Duty, Fortnite Destiny 2, Fortnite Call of Duty, Fortnite Division, Destiny 2.
[136:59.48]Am I going nuts?
[137:01.92]And the Game Award for Best Ongoing Game goes to...
[137:07.04]Fortnite.
[137:08.16]You don't know.
[137:10.70]You don't know.
[137:11.22]I know.
[137:16.68]But yeah, it's Fortnite.
[137:17.62]You got it.
[137:18.20]You got it right.
[137:30.55]What's that one that goes like this?
[137:31.33]Like...
[137:33.61]Oh, this is amazing.
[137:35.19]Thank you.
[137:38.25]So, like last year, we represent just like the teeniest portion of the now over a thousand people who work to make Fortnite something that is incredible every single day.
[137:53.19]We'd like to thank all the thousand people that are spending millions of dollars on the store.
[137:58.64]To have the opportunity to even make something like Fortnite, it's incredible.
[138:05.28]I think that, you know, as I was saying earlier, right, like this idea that we need to lean into what a persistent virtual place can be.
[138:14.84]And the more that we're trying to experiment with stuff and try different things, we're finding more and more that our goal
[138:22.39]is to try to create a metaverse, to create a place, right, where all IP can live together, where all kinds of experiences can happen, where we can create a thing that is totally new, a totally new emergent type of media, really.
[138:40.20]And we are so inspired by everything you're doing.
[138:43.68]I'm just blown away by what we see here tonight.
[138:46.60]It's truly astounding and incredible.
[138:51.93]Thank you for all the work you do.
[138:53.76]Thank you for all the people who play Fortnite, who come up to all of us all the time and give us your incredible ideas and your feedback.
[139:01.40]And we just can't wait to keep making more.
[139:05.48]I'd be remiss if I didn't take one little personal note to thank my wife, my daughter, my family, my party people.
[139:12.23]We love you.
[139:13.07]Thank you so much.
[139:16.74]See you guys Saturday.
[139:18.12]You gotta get credit for credit.
[139:22.25]They took a game that was a third-person, Plants vs. Zombies, dumb third-person shooter, and they made it a BR that every single human has played.
[139:31.89]From the developers who worked on Max Payne, Quantum Break, Armor 3, World of Tanks, and Free Will Pursuit Mobile...
[140:01.67]But it's because of... Hold on.
[140:07.51]What the fuck?
[140:09.59]Client called.
[140:10.65]Intel is located.
[140:12.18]Okay.
[140:12.96]Thanks, Jane.
[140:14.24]But the competition is sending their team.
[140:16.96]As expected.
[140:18.04]Let's get this job done.
[140:28.38]What have they even shown?
[140:31.18]I don't... Listen, guys, they spent more time on the fake trailer than they did at the video game that they made.
[140:37.06]Huh?
[140:47.77]Now a lot of modern shooters can be a little bit chaotic and that's kind of what makes 9 to 5 special.
[140:53.89]We really put a lot of focus on the strategic gameplay of the team and playing together and making your changes in your tactics from round to round.
[141:02.58]And obviously all that triumphs over brute force at the end.
[141:06.05]Alright.
[141:06.25]Well, when can we expect to hear more?
[141:07.65]Next year?
[141:08.57]So 2020, we're launching the Alpha, but you can actually sign up today at 9to5.game.
[141:14.70]So go ahead, enjoy, and download.
[141:17.14]Alright.
[141:17.46]A little bit of a tease.
[141:18.72]9to5.
[141:19.12]Alright.
[141:19.58]Thanks very much for being here.
[141:20.50]Appreciate it.

[142:39.21]This year, we also added a fan category over the past few days.
[142:43.27]He's going to get told he won that, like, tomorrow by somebody that, like, works with him, like, in an office or something.
[142:47.51]Your favorite game.
[142:48.49]This was 100% in control of the fans.
[142:50.95]He'll find that out on Twitter later.
[142:52.13]And the winner of the fan vote is Fire Emblem Three Houses.
[142:56.11]Congratulations.
[142:58.16]Alright.
[142:58.90]Well, throughout the show, you've heard three incredible stories about Global Gaming Citizens.
[143:03.85]And we're so honored to have them here with us tonight.
[143:06.97]Please join me in recognizing this year's class of Global Gaming Citizens.
[143:12.55]We joke, but that's not even true.
[143:13.89]Didn't Mads Mikkelsen actually say that he was excited for where the medium is going?
[143:19.48]That's unfair.
[143:20.62]That's unfair.
[143:21.54]That's unfair.
[143:23.46]Congratulations, guys.
[143:31.48]Reggie's in the house, dude.
[143:33.24]Hey, Reggie's still here.
[143:34.34]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[143:53.66]Actually, they're like, Reggie's here!
[143:55.90]Reggie's here!
[143:56.56]And they show his chair and he's just gone.
[143:58.52]And then he's left.
[143:59.03]It's like, oh.
[143:59.53]So Reggie left!
[144:00.13]What the fuck do we do now?
[144:19.44]Somebody just said, I can't believe they actually showed the Xbox.
[144:34.13]The new Xbox.
[144:36.92]That's insane.
[144:38.02]I haven't even processed that.
[144:46.28]There's somebody at E3 right now that organizes E3 that did a double hand on the desk go through the center of the table.
[144:54.60]It just bent in half. ...
[145:18.51]At E3.
[145:18.93]We've decided.
[145:21.75]They already talked about the Xbox.
[145:23.57]And the PS5 is leaked already.
[145:25.15]Shit, what do we do?
[145:27.22]We're going to come up with a console.
[145:28.88]The E3 console.
[145:32.14]Make sure it's more powerful than the Xbox.
[145:36.14]We can run our own damn show.
[145:42.47]The EEB.
[145:44.21]The Electronic Entertainment Box.
[145:47.17]Launch it.
[145:48.06]You are not a monster.
[145:50.56]You have yet to see justice.
[146:03.43]Be sure to stay in the light.
[146:15.85]That's the show, let's play some magic.
[146:20.56]I wonder... I wonder who paid the most money on this particular game awards.
[146:28.18]Can't be magic together.
[146:29.45]Show them back to back.
[146:30.41]Back to back.
[146:31.33]These two paid for half this fucking show.
[146:44.70]brightest and darkest parts of the scene to look their best features like these are why Samsung qled TV was a best of innovation honoree for gaming at ces 2019 and they're nominated again for 2020. I just wanted I wanted to turn around and face the camera it's just like I didn't think anybody was really gonna play this game
[147:10.50]We got over a half a million letters written in the first couple months, which just, we were not prepared for.
[147:17.74]Kind Words is a game about writing nice letters to people, all real people, anonymously, online, sharing their worries, and making each other feel better.
[147:27.61]Pushing the definition of games is something that I really get excited about.
[147:40.74]Endless world.
[147:45.26]Endless heroes.
[147:47.11]This music is perfect.
[147:49.41]You'll never stop spending money in our fucking endless game.
[147:53.83]You're gonna try.
[147:54.99]But once you run out of gems, you're gonna have to pay money.
[148:00.07]Or wait 25 minutes to continue playing.
[148:03.78]Oh, it says it's free.
[148:09.89]But you and I both know it's not!
[148:13.75]WD Black.
[148:16.23]Fine-tuned for performance.
[148:18.37]Purpose-built for gamers to play without limits.
[148:21.90]Storage solutions with the capacity, speed, and reliability to win.
[148:28.68]WD Black.
[148:30.10]Drive your game.
[148:39.15]The Undertaker will take your money.
[148:40.61]We are excited to welcome WD Black to the Game Awards as the official storage sponsor.
[148:44.50]All of tonight's world premieres have been safely stored on WD Black.
[148:48.38]And is Reggie still in the audience?
[148:51.85]For a chance to win a decked out gaming rig and WD Black products.
[148:55.89]Here it comes.
[149:12.88]Am I allowed to stream this part?
[149:14.40]Is this Vaude getting a meter?
[149:16.62]That was Vaude.
[149:44.02]Do I have to mute my VOD?
[149:47.25]I have to... I can't... I can't stream this part.
[149:50.69]I actually can't stream this part.
[149:57.67]Can... I... Can I?
[149:59.58]I'm trying to protect my live stream.
[150:10.82]Just sing it.
[150:14.38]Welcome to Paradise.
[150:46.26]Oh, wait.
[150:47.24]He's standing up for the first time all the Lord Show.
[150:49.90]Look at the glasses.
[150:58.10]Ow!
[151:06.01]Welcome to Paradise.
[151:24.72]Don't swear at me!
[151:25.44]Don't swear at me!
[151:55.20]Oh, what if he's just like, they keep going?
[151:57.11]I forgot the words to the song.
[152:02.79]Somebody come, somebody go to the mic, I don't remember the song.
[152:08.65]Oh.
[152:33.18]Everybody loves Green Day.
[152:37.96]How could you not like... What do you mean?
[152:39.82]How could you... I don't even know.
[152:45.92]There's at least one Green Day song that you actually like.
[152:48.56]I know there is.
[152:52.50]You added it to your Spotify playlist.
[152:55.30]At least one.
[153:05.99]And I know this because almost every single high school commencement ceremony ends with a Green Day song.
[153:15.02]And you nodded your head to it.
[153:16.46]It's alright, you can come down here and dance if you want to.
[153:31.13]Please.
[153:32.51]Bring Bunsen and Beaker out here.
[153:34.50]Please.
[153:34.96]Get Bunsen and Beaker out here.
[153:36.84]Look for it.
[153:37.36]Look for it.
[153:43.32]This one.
[153:43.68]It's the one.
[153:44.12]You know what I'm talking about.
[153:49.20]It's going to be like elbows in, out, out.
[153:51.94]Den.
[153:52.12]Ben.
[153:52.31]Ben.
[153:52.47]Watch.
[154:01.57]You'll see it.
[154:02.11]Just follow my finger.
[154:04.05]Follow my finger.
[154:08.43]You watch.
[154:08.99]Here it comes.
[154:14.50]It's the... And you bend up, down.
[154:17.00]That one.
[154:18.78]No.
[154:19.20]Fuck.
[154:23.96]Somebody do it.
[154:42.34]I don't even give a shit about the song going on.
[154:44.40]I'm like looking for the Fortnite dancer.
[154:47.66]I hope he doesn't.
[154:56.66]I hope he doesn't.
[155:38.26]I'm the only one doing it!
[155:42.03]I'm the only person doing this.
[155:44.77]Now, I have to put him down, but I can't, because that means that I'm admitting defeat.
[155:48.23]Nobody did it.
[156:07.17]I was...
[156:24.54]How about that?
[156:25.74]Green Day, everybody.
[156:27.70]The worlds of virtual reality and rock just collided like never before.
[156:31.23]Beat Saber and Green Day, the collab we've always wanted, and you don't have to wait long.
[156:36.51]The music pack drops tonight on all platforms.
[156:40.53]Soon you'll be able to play six of the band's iconic hits and brand new singles from the album Father of All, which is out on February 7th.
[156:47.81]Thank you so much to Green Day for playing the Game Awards.
[156:51.89]That was cool.
[156:52.54]That was cool.
[156:53.02]That was cool.
[156:53.36]Alright.
[156:53.62]You gotta give it to Jeff, okay?
[156:54.74]He's trying to... He's trying to do... He's trying to make this a big deal.
[156:57.14]You gotta give it to Jeff.
[156:57.90]He's trying.
[156:58.26]He is.
[156:58.42]No, they're not leaving.
[156:59.36]They're going back to their seat.
[157:18.66]it is an eternal island of legend a place of unimaginable beauty and a growing evil where the forces of death and life are in constant conflict listen
[157:54.56]I'm not doing this am I doing this only to fall to its corrupt I'm not playing this right I'm not that's not the video's not open
[158:43.91]And now, you have come to this place, lured by the promise of power and immortality.
[158:54.01]The darkness will cling.
[159:05.99]Oh, I love it.
[159:08.21]That's New World, and I was just down at Irvine at the studio visiting the devs a couple months ago.
[159:12.64]Had a great time playing it.
[159:13.92]It looks really cool, and you can get more info at newworld.com.
[159:17.74]Alright, well, now please welcome to the stage a good friend of the Game Awards.
[159:22.48]He's been here every year since the first show with a perfect attendance record.
[159:27.22]Of course, he's the former president of Nintendo of America, a friend to all of us.
[159:30.80]You can follow him at Twitter, at Reggie.
[159:32.60]Bring him on.
[159:33.08]Give it up for Reggie Fils-Aimé.
[159:40.37]He's got the cool glasses.
[159:41.81]And he's got the cool glasses.
[159:44.65]You all made fun of me for that?
[159:59.06]Fils-Aimé is in the house.
[160:04.48]Thank you, thank you, thank you for that warm welcome.
[160:08.38]It was just over 16 years ago that I joined this industry as an executive.
[160:14.95]But truth be told, I've been around as a fan and as a player for so much longer.
[160:22.93]Like you, I've witnessed the growth of our favorite form of entertainment, and now video games are bigger than the movie industry.
[160:34.77]bigger than music, bigger than television.
[160:42.12]But most importantly, video games continue to innovate, not only as entertainment, but also into areas far more profound.
[160:54.14]Experiences with their foundation in video game technology are being used to help surgeons practice before a difficult procedure.
[161:04.00]and to enable college students to simulate business situations and develop real-world skills.
[161:12.12]I may no longer be an executive in this industry, but I'll always be an ambassador for video games as a force for good and a force for fun.
[161:28.09]He's quitting?
[161:29.67]I don't think he got the memo.
[161:32.24]In this category, Fresh Indie Game, you can see how games are continuing to evolve as entertainment.
[161:41.77]I think this is the most important award of the night because I believe indie developers are the most important creators in this industry.
[161:56.44]Why?
[161:57.02]Who wrote that?
[161:58.68]Because every nominee this year and every year at one time was an indie developer.
[162:07.09]In the same sense that everyone was once a kid sketching a superhero in the middle of class or lying in bed at night thinking of worlds and challenges that no one had ever dreamed of before.
[162:22.21]For my friend, Shigeru Miyamoto, those ideas began around the woods near his house in Kyoto.
[162:31.37]And for my dear departed friend, Satoru Iwata, those ideas led him to invent his first video game on a portable calculator while he was still in high school.
[162:45.48]These guys fucking made everything.
[162:48.23]They both became fixtures in the history of video games.
[162:53.47]But first, they were dreamers.
[162:56.33]And they began with their imagination.
[162:59.61]So like everyone else at the start, they were true indie developers.
[163:05.94]Any awards event is, by definition, a look backwards.
[163:11.42]Who's done something great in the preceding year?
[163:15.35]But in this category, you can look forward.
[163:19.37]If you want to see the incubator where future game greatness is evolving, it resides right here in this indie category, recognizing brand new independent studios who released their first game this year.
[163:36.01]Really?
[163:38.29]Let's take a look.
[163:39.57]Fresh indie game presented by Subway.
[163:43.51]Oh, shit.
[163:43.89]This is really?
[164:03.42]Yeah, they're all good.
[164:04.20]I like that one.
[164:05.82]I like that one.
[164:09.66]They're all good.
[164:10.22]Alright.
[164:12.06]And the Game Award goes to... Disco Elysium.
[164:22.33]Disco Elysium also wins Best Independent Game.
[164:26.07]Tonight, they're taking home a total of four Game Awards.
[164:39.48]So I'd like to thank all the great people that came before us.
[164:45.58]Ilya Repin.
[164:47.28]Ilya Repin.
[164:48.74]Vladimir Mayakovsky.
[164:51.12]Viktor Tsoi.
[164:53.29]And Marks and Engels for providing us the political education.
[164:56.93]Thank you.
[165:15.46]I've been looking back.
[165:17.52]Looking back my whole life.
[165:19.71]Back to my family, my friends.
[165:23.63]My son.
[165:25.43]They say you can't change a person, but a person can change.
[165:29.75]With time.
[165:30.35]Change a mind, change a heart.
[165:38.86]That might be good enough for you.
[165:46.24]But I can change anything.
[165:56.16]Is that a game?
[165:58.38]Is this another single-player League of Legends game?
[166:00.64]Or is that a TV show?
[166:02.08]Alright, surprise!
[166:02.96]There's a second League of Legends announcement tonight.
[166:05.79]I'm joined by the creative director of Double Stallion Games, Lee Thomas.
[166:08.73]Lee, why don't you tell us a bit about what we just saw?
[166:11.44]Sure.
[166:11.80]Well, that was quite an experience.
[166:15.10]So yeah, we're here.
[166:15.84]It's been an amazing time keeping this secret, but we are working with Riot Forge, making Convergence a League of Legends story.
[166:22.63]So what is it?
[166:23.35]It's a single-player action platformer where you play Echo.
[166:26.53]Echo is a young inventor who has created a device that can manipulate time.
[166:30.83]I'm going to send you down into Zorn, into the depths of the sump, and we're going to deliver a rich... Don't be so surprised, guys.
[166:36.66]League of Legends has so many fans, and people really, really love these characters.
[166:44.43]They wouldn't just, like Disney style, just make like eight different Mickey Mouse shows.
[166:48.99]Alright, in just a moment,
[166:50.19]five of the nominees are going to go head to head in the best game direction category we'll see who wins that one and we've still got some surprises left the game awards will be right back there's they've said so they've like how many uh no stadia no I'm sorry I am talking how many champions are in league of legends like 250 that's 250 different separate TV shows they could make
[167:21.43]gaming machines.
[167:23.15]Stadia is a gift that won't ever stop growing.
[167:26.37]A gift that doesn't take up any space.
[167:29.74]The gift of up to 4K 60FPS.
[167:35.22]A gift that gives you games anywhere and everywhere and anywhere and any everywhere with Wi-Fi.
[167:42.63]You can even ask yourself for Stadia and give it to yourself.
[167:46.91]Get the unthinkable, multi-screenable, no downloads, no updates, self-giftable gift of Stadia.
[167:53.50]One place for all the ways we play.
[168:01.02]When are you ever going to do that on an iPhone screen?
[168:05.84]Be real with me for a minute.
[168:07.24]Why would you just bring it to your iPhone?
[168:08.79]Are you taking a shit?
[168:10.95]But then you have to have the controller.
[168:13.05]So you have the controller in your hand, but then you have an iPhone that you hold in your mouth.
[168:16.75]Can you use the iPhone to do it?
[168:20.05]Is the iPhone a controller?
[168:23.31]There's an attachment.
[168:30.81]You have to, like, take the phone, like, put it in your face.
[168:41.31]No, I wouldn't want to just put that on the screen.
[168:43.41]I don't want to feel like a big AAA game on the toilet.
[168:49.53]When I sit down and I play a game, I sit there for like fucking two hours sometimes.
[168:54.46]I'm not gonna sit in the toilet for two hours.
[168:56.00]I've yet done it before.
[169:11.28]Oh, that's actually kind of cool.
[169:15.14]I would play that.
[169:15.74]Nintendo Switch has worlds to explore and adventures to conquer.
[169:23.15]But that trailer was kind of a little bizarre.
[169:26.81]But I would probably play that game.
[169:37.50]Find your adventure on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite.
[169:43.38]I don't even need to say it.
[169:45.26]Uh oh.
[169:45.54]It's back.
[169:46.06]Look at all that information on the screen.
[169:47.60]Did I count four health bars?
[170:16.01]This is like when you go to someone's house that has World of Warcraft and they have like 30 mods installed and you can't even physically log in with your character because everything is so fucking strange.
[170:29.20]The UI is so different and they have like a million things on the screen.
[170:36.00]I played all games like that with no... You probably can't hear a word I'm saying.
[170:47.95]I play for evening Justin Bieber
[171:01.47]Never mind.
[171:01.91]What's going on, everybody?
[171:02.85]I'm professional esports host and commentator Goldenboy.
[171:06.13]And since 2017, Samsung and Xbox have worked together to deliver amazing experiences for all gamers.
[171:12.05]That's why I teamed up with them to create something special for the fans.
[171:16.21]The ultimate FTW sweepstakes.
[171:18.75]And I want to give a huge shout-out to our winner, Isaiah Yanez, also known as Buddy Roy.
[171:24.12]You are the winner of the Upgrade FTW Sweeps.
[171:27.24]You won this killer Samsung 75-inch Q70R QLED TV, a Q70 sound bar, an Xbox One X, and 12 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
[171:38.19]Safe to say that's a lot of nuts.
[171:39.49]Congrats, and thank you so much for joining us here tonight.
[171:42.17]Now, everyone, let's just enjoy the Game Awards some more.
[171:45.15]I won.
[171:45.77]I did it.
[171:47.14]Thank you, Golden Boy.
[171:48.22]And now it's time for a world premiere, a re-announcement that I think you'll be excited about.
[171:52.34]A re-announcement.
[171:53.30]Elden Ring?
[171:53.78]Alright, if it's Elden Ring, I'm going to be real happy.
[171:57.56]Elden Ring.
[172:00.41]There was a time when you were heartless, brutal, a monster.
[172:10.71]And I'm proud of you for changing all that, but...
[172:15.86]I'm here to ask you to be those things once more.
[172:18.94]For them.
[172:23.54]For me.
[172:26.46]Can I count on you?
[172:27.92]Who the fuck is making this game?
[172:29.62]Bigby.
[172:31.06]Can I count on you?
[172:34.67]Always.
[172:36.39]What?
[172:44.84]Is that Ghost Britain by Telltale?
[172:47.28]Now, she's an Emmy-winning writer and an accomplished voice actor.
[172:51.61]Please welcome Ashley Burch.
[172:57.87]Didn't somebody bought Telltale?
[173:00.54]Right?
[173:00.78]Hello, everyone.
[173:02.14]They purchased Telltale.
[173:05.32]The best games start with a single person asking a single question.
[173:10.04]What if...
[173:11.50]And when that question excites other people and they start asking what if, it's a snowball of creativity and passion that pushes games to be the best they can possibly be.
[173:21.21]These are the nominees for the Best Game Direction.
[173:25.31]Best Game Direction.
[173:26.25]Who's making that game?
[173:27.49]I can't get over it.
[173:29.51]Here I am.
[173:29.97]Who's making it?
[173:30.59]It's so hard to form connections.
[173:43.05]Yup yup yup yup yup yup!
[173:55.31]Resident Evil 2, hands down, is the best one.
[173:58.08]Hands down.
[173:58.52]If it loses, I'll actually be mad.
[174:01.16]Alright, that's it.
[174:02.18]I'm actually upset about that.
[174:05.10]I never get invested in this shit, but that actually makes me regret it.
[174:07.46]I'm actually irritated about that.
[174:09.94]I am.
[174:10.58]I'm not going to hide it.
[174:14.97]Resident Evil 2, from start to finish, was... I was close to perfectly pissed.
[174:21.13]It was...
[174:27.15]Thank you.
[174:28.07]Thank you so much.
[174:30.81]It was a start from zero four years ago, but I'm very happy to come back to this stage tonight.
[174:45.32]From the beginning, Sony, who got on the same boat as me, to Gerira, who provided the engine, to the cast who got on the same boat, to the artists, to the composers,
[175:02.02]Also, I would like to thank all the staff and family members who have been with us for the past 4 years.
[175:07.95]Thank you.
[175:16.64]I really want to thank a lot of people started the ship going.
[175:20.92]Sony started out with us, and also Guerrilla for providing the game engine.
[175:26.53]And also, it was a small boat, but all the cast came on board.
[175:31.01]The musicians, the artists, the people who collaborated, thank you so much.
[175:35.09]Konami right now is crying somewhere in slot machine revenue.
[175:39.19]came to work together I would really like to thank them and also my family and best of all the fans who waited four years thank you so much
[175:56.19]Konami looked at their balance sheet and said, hey, we made more money in one day with our slot machines than in a decade of video game revenue.
[176:15.35]It's over?
[176:16.41]This is it?
[176:16.77]It's coming up?
[176:17.19]This is the end?
[176:19.81]The 2019 gaming tweet of the year.
[176:20.99]Resident Evil 2 has got to come.
[176:22.03]It's got something.
[176:24.25]Mr. X is like the best.
[176:25.17]Mr. X is the best.
[176:26.03]Mr. X is the best video game antagonist in a very, very, very long time.
[177:05.25]I think it's the masks.
[177:06.54]Because this is not Destiny 2, but it's the Destiny 2 mask with the blue lights in it.
[177:12.90]That's the problem.
[177:14.02]Every game has the mask with the lights in it.
[177:17.11]The green or blue lights in the mask.
[177:21.05]What is this?
[177:33.16]It literally said it was ESO.
[177:34.56]That wasn't the intention.
[177:54.66]Is there a best VR game?
[177:56.18]Why is that strangely absent?
[177:59.67]Is that not here?
[178:04.88]It already happened?
[178:10.17]Why was SUPERHOT VR not on it?
[178:12.31]Oh, SUPERHOT VR came out in 2017.
[178:16.69]Excuse me.
[178:35.47]Room temperature IQ.
[178:38.04]Have you guys heard of Magic the Gathering?
[178:40.66]Check it out.
[178:44.34]It's like, right now.
[178:45.50]Redditor?
[178:56.57]Alright, what was that?
[179:24.86]No, I see the honeycomb.
[179:26.08]I'm not interested.
[179:30.72]You can guarantee I won't play a game if it has the honeycomb on it.
[179:33.21]That's just personal preference.
[179:35.07]I'm sorry.
[180:01.81]Download a bunch of free games and keep them forever.
[180:07.65]Now she's an actress and producer.
[180:10.59]Please welcome Michelle Rodriguez.
[180:13.51]Are we at the end of the year?
[180:15.71]How y'all doing today?
[180:20.89]I'm invested in you.
[180:23.19]I'm happy to be here.
[180:28.03]There's one last game announcement to share with you tonight, and I'm really excited about it.
[180:34.40]Allow me to present the world premiere of our latest expansion to the Fast and Furious saga.
[180:54.05]Is it a movie I'm going to split it's the only way to keep you both safe I Think I know someone who can help Ready to ride
[181:22.71]We want revenge.
[181:25.04]We want justice.
[181:26.28]Vin Diesel did not voice act in this game.
[181:28.26]They just pulled samples from the last 10 movies.
[181:31.14]We're going to jump onto a moving train.
[181:32.92]You know how many times he says that?
[181:34.00]You're rather than Rod.
[181:37.00]Let's go.
[181:38.68]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[181:41.65]Push him.
[181:43.35]Come on.
[181:44.03]When in doubt, do what I do.
[181:46.43]See?
[181:46.63]I've seen what you do.
[181:51.72]That's why I'm kind of terrified.
[182:01.96]Vin Diesel will live off of royalties that people are using.
[182:10.52]Vin Diesel will live forever with his generic free sentences that he said.
[182:19.60]He will be collecting just revenue
[182:22.58]Forever.
[182:22.90]I'm excited for that one.
[182:24.26]Can you believe it?
[182:26.68]It's been like 18 years, man.
[182:29.54]From a little article in a newspaper to a movie to a video game.
[182:34.39]It's pretty cool.
[182:36.65]I'd like to now introduce a surprise guest and also one of my friends for life.
[182:43.89]Is it Vin Diesel?
[182:44.51]Vin Diesel.
[182:58.38]I hope he just speaks in one-liners.
[183:00.36]It would be great.
[183:00.84]I want him to speak in one-liners.
[183:05.18]Do it.
[183:15.05]Do not tempt me.
[183:20.47]Michelle, we are in our crowd.
[183:23.29]I know.
[183:25.30]We have been gamers.
[183:27.00]We have been gamers forever.
[183:29.13]And we are at an award show.
[183:30.95]Why is he leaning down sideways?
[183:33.65]Literally.
[183:35.13]Me and Ben used to just like literally spend all night playing like Tekken Fighter games or Street Fighter.
[183:44.72]Yeah, this is... It's amazing to see that trailer finally.
[183:53.38]I'm gonna tell you a secret, too.
[183:55.36]I didn't tell you before.
[183:57.34]Yesterday, I saw the four-minute trailer to Fast 9.
[184:01.29]What is he doing?
[184:02.37]Turn this way, man.
[184:07.03]Why is this back to the audience?
[184:09.26]Back to you guys.
[184:12.87]I love all of you.
[184:14.11]Okay, so... At this point, Vin, just grab the mic and lift it up from the base.
[184:20.28]Here to pay tribute to all of the nominees for Game of the Year, once again, the Game Awards Orchestra.
[184:29.76]Is it nailed down?
[184:42.24]Her reaction was awesome.
[184:43.42]She's just like, yeah.
[184:46.54]That little, like, yeah.
[184:52.30]I am not certain of very many things, but I am certain of this.
[184:57.33]More than anything.
[184:59.63]The Outer Worlds is not going to win Game of the Year.
[185:04.49]I have never been more certain of something in my entire life.
[185:16.48]It just will not.
[185:22.85]Does that make me a villain for saying that?
[185:26.57]That's not going to win game of the year.
[185:31.37]That makes me a villain apparently.
[185:47.44]It's gonna be right there.
[185:49.95]It's gonna be right there.
[186:02.59]I mean, but like Smash is like a pretty big achievement.
[186:06.13]There's so much stuff in Smash.
[186:08.15]There's so much in it.
[186:09.55]There's like a thousand characters and they keep adding them.
[186:13.94]I thought I was seeing something.
[186:18.06]That was weird.
[186:21.84]That kind of startled me.
[186:34.19]I admit it could be that too, but I don't think so.
[186:48.73]That was an insane... Sekiro was a really polarizing game.
[186:52.28]It was very polarizing.
[186:55.20]There's like a you either really liked it or you hated it for Sekiro.
[186:58.24]For a lot of people.
[187:03.14]That was pretty polarizing, isn't it?
[187:06.55]I liked it.
[187:11.51]So is Death Stranding.
[187:13.11]Yeah.
[187:14.57]And which game on this list had no polarized... I mean, besides this guy.
[187:19.07]I don't know what... What, did he come from the ground?
[187:31.92]Resident Evil is fucked.
[187:33.96]It's the only one on that list that makes sense to me.
[187:41.50]Come on.
[187:44.50]Securito is good.
[187:45.42]It was.
[187:46.09]It was very good.
[187:49.45]Smash Bros.
[187:50.01]is a really good achievement in video games.
[187:53.27]But Resident Evil, the remake, is just what remakes can be.
[187:58.87]They keep telling me don't lean down.
[188:03.31]As my daughter would say, Dad, take over your fear.
[188:07.74]It's very good.
[188:09.10]And the game of the year award goes to... Sekiro.
[188:24.54]Tonight, Sekiro Shadows Die Twice also wins Best Action Adventure Game.
[188:42.51]I think Resident Evil 2 is a better game, that's for sure.
[188:48.59]The knife just hit behind me.
[188:50.81]Boom!
[188:51.11]The tomahawk just hit the fucking wall.
[188:54.16]Thank you so much.
[189:02.58]But I really get that.
[189:06.20]He's very moves.
[189:09.45]If it wasn't Resident Evil, then it probably shouldn't be Sekiro.
[189:12.57]I agree with that.
[189:13.65]So Sekiro has a lot of difficult and complex elements that made us a little unsure when it was about to come out.
[189:18.80]And we were both surprised and overjoyed at the reaction that we saw.
[189:48.64]So I'd like to share the joy of receiving this award with the staff at FromSoftware, who pulled out all the stops to make it happen, as well as the team at Activision for their ongoing support throughout.
[189:58.54]It was good.
[190:03.05]It was.
[190:05.51]And finally, I'd like to give out a huge thank you to our players.
[190:08.25]We couldn't have done it without you, and it was a huge honor to make.
[190:11.87]So we will continue to try and make the best games we possibly can.
[190:34.18]Thank you so much.
[190:34.88]Thank you
[190:46.50]Congratulations FromSoftware Miyazaki-san.
[190:48.81]Game of the year for Sekiro.
[190:50.11]Alright guys, well that's gonna do it for the Game Awards 2019.
[190:52.85]Thank you so much for joining us.
[190:54.63]We'll see you again next December to keep celebrating games.
[190:57.81]Have a great night.
[190:58.63]Thank you very much.
[190:59.49]Good night everybody.
[191:00.57]They just revitalized their entire company.
[191:05.18]Capcom just has so many great things that they did this last year or two.
[191:10.78]They deserve something.
[191:17.83]That's it?
[191:18.25]There's nothing?
[191:18.69]That's it?
[191:19.90]That's it?
[191:23.10]What do I do now?
[191:25.40]Sorry your meme game didn't win.
[191:28.38]That was... That game was very... It was so... That game was so good.
[191:32.79]It was so good.
[191:46.36]Here are my thoughts.
[191:59.67]I don't remember any of the games.
[192:00.79]I don't remember anything.
[192:04.41]I remember No More Heroes 3.
[192:09.15]And then I remember the Gemini Man trailer.
[192:14.78]So if that means anything, that means that No More Heroes 3 is probably going to be cool, I think.
[192:25.58]That that's what that means.
[192:28.04]Constant conflict.
[192:28.88]We did.
[192:29.16]We did.
[192:29.48]We got it.
[192:29.86]We did get it.
[192:30.56]You're right.
[192:30.86]We got a constant conflict.
[192:31.92]You're right.
[192:33.24]The Muppets came out.
[192:34.08]Yeah.
[192:35.06]They were there.
[192:35.74]And the goose was there too.
[192:42.47]What else happened?
[192:48.80]I don't know.
[192:51.06]We saw...
[192:52.80]A bunch of MMOs and some mobile games and Reggie was there.
[192:56.96]Yeah, Green Day was there.
[193:02.73]Magic the Gathering.
[193:06.23]I'm just, I'm kind of sad that Resident Evil 2 didn't win anything.
[193:09.57]That was the time that I had.
[193:12.19]Let me get the headphone out of here.
[193:13.30]I don't want anyone talking to me.
[193:17.70]The feeling of real dread.
[193:20.78]It was a remake.
[193:38.78]So what?
[193:39.26]It was a remake from 1998.
[193:42.36]It was a really, really, it was a really good game.
[193:49.40]It was like the feeling of dread going around corners.
[193:53.24]It was brilliantly paced.
[193:55.14]It was the revitalization of Capcom as a company.
[193:57.96]They came up with like Monster Hunter: World.
[194:00.00]That was great.
[194:00.99]And then they had Resident Evil 2 and now they're coming up with Resident Evil 3.
[194:05.63]You said that already.
[194:09.79]Don't you know that when you lose, you just go on repeat until you go to sleep that night?
[194:22.40]When the stream's over, I'm gonna be in the mirror going, the sense of dread that I had.
[194:26.58]Turn the corners, Mr. X was so brilliantly, brilliantly cast.
[194:32.81]And then I'm gonna turn the shower on, like lean backwards and have cold water just hit me right in my eyes.
[194:41.97]I know, I know, but I think Red and Evil 2 deserve something.
[194:44.64]Even if it was just like... They brought them on stage and gave them a fucking... Like, you got a shot lollipop.
[194:52.32]I thought it was Game of the Year.
[194:53.06]I thought it was.
[194:53.54]I thought it was, but you know what?
[194:54.44]Whatever.
[194:55.90]You can't win them all.
[194:56.80]You can't win them all.
[194:57.40]Because I obviously had something to do with that game.
[194:59.66]So I'm so invested.
[195:01.02]You know, you can't win them all.
[195:07.90]Alright, let's talk about Minecraft.
[195:16.31]He's a 10 on the Jerma scale.
[195:17.74]No, it was a fun show.
[195:19.60]They're trying.
[195:22.86]Alright.
[195:23.52]Are you guys ready?
[195:27.58]Talk about constant conflict.
[195:28.70]I don't even know what that game was.
[195:30.12]I just know it exists.
[195:33.80]Okay.
[195:35.12]So.
[195:37.11]Those of you that don't know what we're about to talk about.
[195:38.65]I actually have to change to just chatting.
[195:43.12]If you just stuck around for the Game Awards, thanks for sticking around.
[195:47.19]Those of you that are still here, we're going to spend a little bit of time going over what's going to happen this weekend.
[195:55.48]I never played the Claire campaign.
[195:57.46]I didn't stream the Claire campaign.
[196:00.72]What?
[196:00.94]I'm not allowed to play something?
[196:02.39]I did not play it off stream.
[196:03.47]I'm lying to you.
[196:14.83]No, I'm kidding.
[196:16.09]My god.
[196:16.83]You think I would say something's a game of the year if I didn't do it all?
[196:19.05]I played half the game.
[196:20.05]Hey, I played all of Sekiro.
[196:24.29]And I played half of Resident Evil 2.
[196:26.03]Uh-oh, that's bad.
[196:27.56]Somebody's going to be like, what the fuck did he just say?
[196:34.40]Anyways, take a look at your screen here.
[196:37.28]We're going to do some drawing.
[196:43.97]Take a look at your screen.
[196:50.26]We are going to talk about what's happening this weekend.
[196:52.78]Now, what are you doing this weekend?
[196:53.84]What do you mean this weekend?
[196:55.28]This weekend, we're going to play a little game called Fuck the King.
[197:00.98]I didn't even change category.
[197:01.98]That's my bad.
[197:05.45]I'll just keep it as obnoxious audience member.
[197:07.29]That's fine.
[197:15.96]So on Sunday, that's the next stream that's going to happen.
[197:22.96]So you will not see me until Sunday.
[197:29.72]About an hour before the stream starts on Sunday, because there's a lot of stuff that we still need to do.
[197:34.92]We will begin the process of putting people into the server.
[197:41.00]Show your Resident Evil 2 achievements.
[197:42.98]No, I don't have to do that.
[197:47.24]So what is going to happen?
[197:48.90]First and foremost, let's start drawing.
[197:52.60]On Sunday, if you are a two month long subscriber, why am I doing this?
[198:13.16]The only way that you will have access to this game is if you have been subbed to the channel for two months straight.
[198:20.35]The reason why this had to happen is because of very obvious things.
[198:25.67]We're trying to protect the server from getting just overloaded with people.
[198:31.30]We're trying to protect the server from insane amounts of connections.
[198:36.72]And we do already have things in place to help with that.
[198:38.90]There's a lot of stuff that these guys are pros.
[198:41.56]They know exactly what they're doing.
[198:46.08]You have to be subbed for two months to play.
[198:48.99]Now what does playing mean?
[198:50.59]What does that mean?
[198:54.25]Playing is opening up your Minecraft client, going to the server, and starting in our little town.
[199:03.53]Our little town's gonna look like this.
[199:07.51]Alright, get off.
[199:12.30]Our little town is going to look like this.
[199:16.09]There's going to be a castle here.
[199:20.23]Like this.
[199:21.73]And down here, there'll be some houses.
[199:25.29]Probably, you know, just random little townhouses.
[199:27.54]There'll be a little garden over here.
[199:34.58]No, it's... It's an apple.
[199:40.30]It's a spider.
[199:41.38]Will you guys just relax?
[199:44.28]right I'm not I can't look at chat you guys are making me laugh so in this town there's a castle right oh look the castle is here inside of this castle is going to be me I am the king of this kingdom the goal that you guys have by the way this there are I gotta write this down too because I want as much info as I can
[200:12.47]The server holds just about, just over 500 people can be on this Minecraft server.
[200:19.84]That's important.
[200:20.58]Two months sub straight, 500 people can play at once.
[200:26.49]And it's going to cycle out all the time because we have some code and an API in place for if you are a sub, if you are a two month plus sub, you just simply have to log into the server and authenticate with Twitch.
[200:41.77]That's how the whitelisting is going to work.
[200:45.61]There's going to be a separate little site that you're going to link into.
[200:50.21]And you'll get a code.
[200:51.63]And it'll verify that you are subbed for two months.
[200:55.55]And then you can join the server.
[200:56.85]When you join the server... You are going to be... Zero years old.
[201:04.57]Now what does that mean?
[201:09.24]That means there's an aging system in the game.
[201:12.20]It takes, as of right now...
[201:15.30]10 hours for you to die.
[201:19.11]This is, by the way, it is a hardcore server.
[201:21.29]If you die, you're out.
[201:25.51]If you die, you cannot come back in.
[201:29.91]You start at zero.
[201:30.73]You're going to age.
[201:31.71]It's going to take 10 hours.
[201:33.29]You have 10 hours of time.
[201:36.87]When you are zero, you can't talk.
[201:43.12]You're essentially a baby.
[201:50.34]You can't talk.
[201:52.04]You can't build.
[201:56.68]And you can't hold a weapon.
[202:00.51]How could you?
[202:05.49]And by the way, you walk at minus, probably trying to still figure out how fast, probably like minus 100% speed.
[202:17.78]All players... I could have, like, made this smaller.
[202:28.13]The age from 0 to... Probably, like, 0 to 2, 0 to 3 is going to take probably about 20 minutes.
[202:38.23]Because you age 0 to 100.
[202:40.01]So let me, like, add this here.
[202:48.15]Start at 0 and die at 100.
[202:59.35]At about 90 years old, you slow down.
[203:06.29]You can't craft that many materials anymore.
[203:09.65]You can't swing a weapon as fast as you used to.
[203:14.82]And you're probably saying, wait a minute, why are you doing this?
[203:18.96]If you start at zero and can't talk, and can't do anything, that prevents you from being able to just try to come kill me immediately.
[203:28.69]You could.
[203:30.09]You could.
[203:31.47]You can still punch.
[203:32.75]You're just not going to do very much damage.
[203:37.16]Good luck.
[203:37.72]By the way, if you die, you can't come back.
[203:44.12]So... I would be careful if I were you.
[203:49.90]A baby rush.
[203:52.24]I'm not going to tell you how to play this game because this is an experiment.
[203:56.01]Baby rush the castle.
[203:58.07]Well, if you do that, just be known that you can't come back and you are going to get all new players, right?
[204:06.21]I already wrote this.
[204:07.87]All new players.
[204:10.57]All new players.
[204:12.14]I'm going to outline this.
[204:15.00]All new players start at zero.
[204:19.40]There's going to be a separate lobby where people can hang out, potentially even a separate server that you're going to connect to.
[204:27.22]Whoever dies, the next person in line is going to come in that has a connected Twitch account.
[204:36.97]So let's say that there is 500 people on the server and 150 of you decide to communicate with each other somehow and do a baby rush and all of you just don't make it.
[204:47.49]100 people that were next in line that have their Twitches connected that are in the lobby will be put into the game at zero.
[204:58.70]Do these rules apply to you?
[204:59.92]No.
[205:05.01]the king which is me has double health and double armor because I'm the fucking king oh sorry forgot to mention something else very very very important let's put it over here there's a stamina bar you have to eat guys and you have to sleep
[205:33.27]You have a stamina bar, it's gonna be in replace of the experience bar.
[205:39.36]If you get to zero stamina, well, you're gonna be very useless, because that means you haven't eaten.
[205:49.56]All actions, and again, all actions require stamina.
[205:57.70]That's putting a block down, that's swinging a weapon, that's walking.
[206:02.64]that's running.
[206:07.65]If you do not eat, you're not gonna be able to do shit.
[206:17.13]I have to eat.
[206:20.19]But I have like three or four caches of steaks in my in my trunk behind me.
[206:24.88]What do I care?
[206:30.38]are you going to eat his babies don't worry there'll be ways to eat poison the king there is going to be another spot so this is all we'll slow down here for a second here when you join the game when you join the server
[206:59.88]Like I said, you're going to have to connect to your Twitch, so if you're two months up, you can come in.
[207:03.06]We're going to spend about an hour before the stream truly begins just getting everybody connected.
[207:13.26]So once everybody's in place and we have commands and we have plugins, we're just going to keep you staying put.
[207:21.77]Outside of these walls is the wilderness.
[207:27.93]outside here right let's just like a million meters outside the real important happens inside the town outside the town you are free to go get resources you can do whatever you want you can go build whatever you want this is this is kind of like out of play but you can use it to get resources we are actually still toying with the idea of having a couple of different servers
[207:57.78]that the town is one server, the wilderness is another instance, right?
[208:06.24]Who's gonna protect the babies?
[208:09.06]Time to rot in the wild.
[208:12.82]Can babies kill babies?
[208:23.38]What you guys are doing in this game,
[208:27.09]Remember, if I die, it's over.
[208:32.65]You have to remember, these two age groups here are really only in place to prevent people from just like detonating the whole server instantly.
[208:46.50]So if you have 10 hours to be in the server,
[208:51.17]Realistically only about 30 or 40 minutes of that time if you stay alive is going to be at these more constrained parts of your life People who are age three are just going to slaughter people who come in Well, it's funny you say that because we're also toying with the idea of having a tag on people's heads that kill innocent people for no reason
[209:24.43]I'm the king, and I'm going to have a bunch of Kingsguard and a bunch of loyal people.
[209:32.50]If there is a crime that's committed that needs to be brought to my attention, I will go investigate this.
[209:40.04]I'm going to have a team of people that are going to be keeping the peace.
[209:47.94]I'm not just going to let my kingdom fall into total ruin.
[209:50.94]Why would I do that?
[209:55.60]I will come out and I will solve problems.
[209:58.24]I will teleport the perpetrator into the throne room and we will have a little trial.
[210:04.99]Well, you're going to be teleporting a bunch of people into that throne room because nobody's going to stop killing zero aged people.
[210:21.32]It's going to be very, very fun for a lot of different reasons.
[210:27.40]I kind of want to just see how this plays out.
[210:31.74]When is this happening on Sunday?
[210:35.46]Do the Kingsguards age at the same rate that you do?
[210:38.82]Yes.
[210:44.10]When I kill your guards, will they respawn?
[210:46.30]No.
[210:47.46]Nobody respawns.
[210:50.24]How is it going to be streamed?
[210:52.32]So, there's going to be a separate mobile studio that is made.
[210:57.98]that is going to be streaming the event and we're gonna have like three or four different cameras free cam flying around to cut to and my perspective because I want to be able to see what what some of the other shit that's happening I want you for a viewer perspective right
[211:18.14]It's more interesting if you guys get to see a ton of different perspectives.
[211:21.99]If you're playing the game, sure, just you're playing the game and you're participating in the little experiment, right?
[211:27.35]But you won't just see my point of view.
[211:32.39]You'll hear me talk and I'll be going over the things that need to be going over with my kingdom.
[211:41.04]How do you join?
[211:43.06]When this server launches...
[211:45.68]Like I said, there's going to be just a little lobby that you can just be in.
[211:50.12]You then connect your Twitch with a separate, there's going to be a separate website that you're going to use that you're going to connect your Twitch API to it.
[211:57.37]It just pulls how many months you've been subscribed to my channel.
[212:01.15]That's it.
[212:01.43]It doesn't do anything else.
[212:07.91]Can the guards betray you?
[212:13.74]No.
[212:18.59]Jeremy, you're trying to get my data.
[212:21.97]Let me be very, very clear about something.
[212:24.71]This is not, oh yeah, I'm just like running a server.
[212:29.05]There's a lot of resources put into this to make sure it works.
[212:35.18]There's a lot of protection.
[212:36.36]There's a lot of servers.
[212:37.40]It is not just running in my basement.
[212:45.97]this stupid experiment is really important to me I don't care if I die in the first five minutes by falling down the fucking stairs I don't care by the way this first iteration of it's called FTK it's called fuck the king FTK the first iteration is very much going to be an alpha beta we're just trying to see if it works
[213:21.38]After we do one, we'll have a lot of... We'll have a lot of info.
[213:29.23]I want to do this more than once.
[213:31.71]I want to add more stuff to it.
[213:33.23]I want to make it more interesting.
[213:35.39]I want to add more... I want to add, like, quests and shit eventually.
[213:38.12]I want to do a bunch of random shit with this server.
[213:43.56]And going back and forth with some of the developers and the people that are making the plugins and the server and everything They're excited too.
[213:50.56]They want to do more stuff on top of this as well But the first one is just to see if we can do it and how long I can last and how how democratically this whole thing can play out or not and it's just chaos and 500 of you rush the front door and die
[214:10.73]And then the next 500 people will then know that that cannot be accomplished.
[214:16.56]Maybe it can.
[214:17.64]Maybe you can sneak into the window in my bathroom and break in and shoot me with a bow and arrow.
[214:24.22]Which, by the way, let's go over another thing.
[214:26.75]I'm not even going to write this down because I can't.
[214:29.15]I'm useless.
[214:31.37]Weapons.
[214:31.95]Oh, Jerma, I'm just going to make an enchantment table and I'm going to make an enchanted bow and you're going to die in one click.
[214:37.51]Nope.
[214:38.91]The only available weapons are bows and swords.
[214:46.95]You cannot do that.
[214:52.07]TNT is something we're still fighting with to figure out if we're going to do it immediately.
[214:56.64]Probably not immediately.
[215:06.16]Just melee weapons that make sense and ranged weapons that make sense.
[215:17.48]I might walk out the front door and get exploded by a creeper.
[215:22.55]It's very possible.
[215:33.57]Potions?
[215:34.25]Not yet, no.
[215:35.37]Like I said, the first stream of this is going to see what happens when 500 plus people are told, hey, you live in a kingdom now and there's a king in there.
[215:46.78]Go get him.
[215:48.46]Or don't.
[215:51.82]Or don't.
[215:53.96]Good luck.
[215:55.08]It's gonna be fucking calamity.
[216:00.34]Can you live in the wilderness?
[216:01.44]Yes.
[216:03.34]know if you want is there voice chat there is not going to be voice chat that would be that would be impossible with 500 people this is very important what Minecraft version this the Minecraft version is going to be 1.8 it is not going to be on the new Minecraft
[216:32.36]I was told there's a lot of, for having this many people in a server, it's just not possible to have like 500 to a thousand people in the same spot.
[216:44.45]It's just not, it's just impossible.
[216:48.43]We could have done maybe like 30 people, 50 people, maybe.
[216:54.56]What's your plan to get 500 people to sleep at the same time?
[216:56.72]You don't have to sleep at the same time.
[217:04.10]And also, I got to make sure that I'm saying this correctly.
[217:07.13]I think once the server is live, it won't matter what version you have.
[217:11.07]You'll just connect to the server and it'll just run it from what I've been told.
[217:15.25]So I think it's going to be running on 1.8, but I don't think you need to have somehow 1.8 something.
[217:24.56]It doesn't work like that.
[217:28.18]I'm completely wrong then.
[217:32.66]Is there safe areas?
[217:34.06]No.
[217:36.46]Can you be guards?
[217:38.38]No.
[217:41.40]Is chat going to be localized?
[217:42.66]Yes.
[217:43.28]That's another thing.
[217:44.76]When you talk, it is only going to be the people that you are in the exact vicinity of.
[217:52.84]There is not a complete and total always global chat.
[217:58.25]Can you be promoted?
[217:59.13]Yes.
[217:59.91]I have the capability to make anyone in the server anyone I want.
[218:07.33]Does the hardcore death bar you from future streams?
[218:09.73]Yes, but this is a very, very large, huge in quotations, but we're going to see how many people are trying to join the server.
[218:28.34]So let's say for instance, after we do this once or twice,
[218:33.44]it's very clear that there are no more players that can even queue up that's when we can be like alright it's from scratch let's do it again but for the first stream or two it's no it's permanent because remember another here's another thing I might not die in the first stream we keep going we keep going
[218:55.42]We'll do it again next week.
[218:56.58]And this is not a persistent server.
[218:59.12]This is not a 24-7.
[219:00.88]It's just on.
[219:01.62]No, no, this server is only turned on when the stream exists.
[219:06.28]Everything is saved.
[219:07.70]Everything is locked in.
[219:09.92]This is not a 24-hour just Minecraft server that's going to exist.
[219:12.96]It's only going to happen on the streams.
[219:20.60]How long is the first stream going to be?
[219:22.12]I don't know.
[219:25.01]Up to- because of how many people are involved, because remember there's three or four cameramen, there's two or three server admins
[219:32.01]And it's a lot of people that are in- a lot of moving parts
[219:36.01]O I would say this stream would be like up to probably two to four hours
[219:40.01]Somewhere betw- it's not going to be more than- the first one- we'll do it in like three to four hour chunks
[219:45.01]Potentially like I'd say up to four plus maybe five hours total
[219:50.01]Because we- there's a lot of people involved and that's obviously a lot of their time, so.
[219:57.50]How do you replace AFK players? That's a great question I'll actually I'll bring that up with the...
[220:01.50]For the next three days this is all I'm doing. So, I- like this is the only thing I'm doing for the next two three straight days until the stream
[220:08.50]So I will bring that up and we'll probably have a certain time limit when they get booted and it brings another person in
[220:19.50]I feel like you're gonna die in the first hour
[220:22.50]Possible, very possible. Do I die at 100? Yes.
[220:30.33]I could just die in the throne room of old age.
[220:34.91]I could just be sitting on the throne room and be 99.
[220:39.80]You didn't get me.
[220:41.20]You'll never kill me.
[220:42.48]And then I'm just going to start burning like money and food and shit.
[220:47.34]I'm going to be buried with the stakes.
[220:49.83]No, no, no.
[220:50.07]I don't want to give up funny, funny fucking scenarios.
[221:02.70]Are you a zero-year-old baby king?
[221:05.09]No.
[221:06.31]I start, I age slower, not by very much, but I do age slower.
[221:11.89]But I do start at a normal, like, 20, 25, something like that, just so I can actually move around.
[221:17.99]I'm not going to be a baby king.
[221:20.31]Who's going to take care of the babies?
[221:22.72]I don't know.
[221:24.18]Maybe you.
[221:25.88]Maybe you'll take care of the babies.
[221:29.28]Maybe you should make that your thing that you do.
[221:34.28]But, Jerma, we're going to kill you in five minutes.
[221:38.02]Sure you're not just going to kill each other?
[221:42.41]Jerma's going to die in ten minutes.
[221:44.17]You think so?
[221:53.50]I already know what's going to happen.
[221:56.28]And I don't even need to say it because you all know.
[221:58.20]The first ten minutes that this is happening...
[222:02.57]200 of you are just gonna be as zero-year-old just go storm the gate and We and then we just freed up 200 more spots on the server so just be aware You're gonna Zerg rush Maybe it'll work
[222:30.62]If you leave the server or you crash, we'll use to... Yeah, it's not tied to me.
[222:36.18]Every time we stream this, there's going to be a couple people who are going to be running the show in the background that are running the server.
[222:43.29]And they can help with problems.
[222:44.43]They can fix things that happen if I crash.
[222:46.49]It doesn't just... Oh, the stream crashed.
[222:48.45]Oh, it's over.
[222:49.53]Like, it'll still exist.
[222:52.36]We can pause it.
[222:52.96]I can come back.
[222:53.56]There's somebody on call that's taking care of it.
[223:04.80]If you live for 10 hours and there's 3 hour streams and you can do it for 3 streams.
[223:09.18]There's also... It might not be 10 hours.
[223:13.76]We can make that whatever we want.
[223:16.01]I can make that 6, right?
[223:17.41]You can make that 6, 7, 5.
[223:18.91]If a player crashes, can they reconnect?
[223:21.45]Yes.
[223:22.67]There's going to be a certain time frame where you can come back.
[223:28.55]Do you have to worry about dying as a baby from an older player?
[223:31.05]Yes.
[223:40.72]But, just be aware, if you are just causing problems, it's real easy to get rid of you.
[223:56.76]I am going to have at least a dozen people that are in the best armor times two in the whole game and are stronger than you.
[224:07.35]They're coming for you.
[224:18.33]There's also the idea that maybe for the first year of your life, maybe you're invincible to other players.
[224:30.03]That's another idea that I'm going to throw out to them.
[224:33.37]That maybe, almost like a spawn protection kind of way.
[224:38.60]So the first 15, 20 minutes of it, you're in the game.
[224:41.69]You can't be killed by another player.
[224:44.29]You can still die from the environment, maybe.
[224:45.85]But I don't know.
[224:46.69]We might just see what happens.
[224:48.83]I want to do this more than once.
[224:49.91]I want to do this more than twice.
[224:51.53]I want to do this at least a few times.
[224:53.57]I think it's a really, really just fun idea.
[224:55.69]I do.
[225:02.53]Baby Rush with invincibility.
[225:07.96]Will you be okay with people streaming it?
[225:11.12]Um... I guess?
[225:14.12]I don't see why not.
[225:17.14]Because... The thing about... If you were to play and stream, right?
[225:22.07]The camera angles will be... That would just be your perspective.
[225:26.53]So... Yes, it's the Java Minecraft.
[225:30.49]Not the Microsoft one.
[225:35.83]Is there a reward for someone that kills you?
[225:38.74]Yes, you turned off the stream.
[225:40.24]That's your reward.
[225:43.40]If we all start as babies, who takes care of us?
[225:47.34]I don't know.
[225:48.52]Ask the cavemen.
[225:50.36]How did they do it?
[225:55.80]How did the first man?
[225:57.22]I don't know.
[225:58.46]Figure it out.
[226:03.95]You have to take care of each other.
[226:07.84]Here's another thing that I was thinking.
[226:10.98]Remember, this is all not set in stone, but the other thing that I was thinking is have some designated community members that are not just going to kill everybody, that can be trusted, that will just be like 10, 15.
[226:29.85]Right?
[226:33.34]Right.
[226:35.27]That's it, but you can still eat and move and do you guys Remember don't when you see like the oh, I'm zero years old if that's just essentially your time in the server so You can still do things you still move around and you just can't talk It actually scrambles your text like it does in games like World of Warcraft if you are a baby and you write something for the first 20 minutes it literally is ineligible and
[227:12.85]So it's basically one hour?
[227:14.11]I would like it to be more than five hours in-server, in-game, for a whole life.
[227:19.75]Between five and ten, we're still trying to figure it out.
[227:21.41]Would there be a thing that hides player name tags?
[227:33.95]not sure yet not sure yet it's what there's going to be there'll be a hud there's going to be a little hud that'll show you your current title your current name your your current health your you'll have a little hud in the corner when is the server going to become available
[227:54.48]it is not ready it the the town is still being built right now so it's not going to be ready till the day that we do it but uh for testing purposes obviously I I might pull in some people like a few maybe like the day before or like that the day of like in the morning we don't get to build yes you can
[228:22.18]There's a whole town that's being built right now.
[228:27.64]It looks awesome.
[228:28.48]It looks unbelievable.
[228:34.81]Where do you guys see this town?
[228:37.83]Do we own property?
[228:40.17]Not immediately.
[228:42.41]Remember, this whole thing is just an alpha 0.5.
[228:46.75]It's very much an experiment in work in progress right now.
[228:53.02]What is available right now is getting all the people there, having the age system in place, having the people, the amount of people that we want, having the stamina bar in the food and having the town and having the outside.
[229:06.13]Those of you saying, well, can I like own property?
[229:10.07]Outside the town, yeah, there's going to be just a whole area that's kind of just to whatever.
[229:15.25]It's going to be when you can do whatever you want.
[229:17.37]But it's also going to take more materials to build.
[229:20.52]When I say materials, you have a stamina bar, right?
[229:22.78]So you can't just build dirt everywhere.
[229:26.26]You can't just, oh, I'm going to pick this up and make a giant like dirt dick.
[229:30.00]That's impossible because you have to have stamina to build.
[229:37.66]It costs stamina for you to place a block.
[229:39.60]Let's just put it that way.
[229:42.16]So you guys are going to have to work together to build houses.
[229:44.46]You can't just make a dirt dick.
[229:46.08]It's not going to happen.
[229:47.76]You could, I guess.
[229:48.86]You could pick your little spot in the wilderness and make a dirt dick.
[229:51.63]But that's going to take you, like, your whole life.
[230:01.27]Don't give them ideas.
[230:06.17]It's worth it.
[230:08.49]My whole life was dedicated to making a dirt dick.
[230:13.42]I can rest peacefully now.
[230:25.30]There's ideas to eventually add and pretty much what you see on the screen right now is what the stream will be at first.
[230:35.11]Once we get one under the belt, there's going to be so much data that we'll have to do it again.
[230:41.34]We'll learn so much from the first one.
[230:46.14]We'll just keep it moving forward.
[230:48.58]There's nothing for us to install.
[230:49.76]Nope.
[230:51.72]You do not have to get any mods.
[230:53.38]You do not have to get anything special.
[230:54.90]You just have to go in the server.
[231:04.31]Entering the server will be putting in the server IP, right?
[231:10.83]Like always.
[231:12.41]Once you get in, you will be in a separate little lobby, which you will then have, there's going to be a separate website that's going to generate a code for you.
[231:21.87]It's going to check to see how many months you've been subbed to the channel.
[231:26.72]Completely separated.
[231:29.17]It'll see.
[231:30.71]You'll get a code.
[231:31.99]Put it in.
[231:33.19]Very simple.
[231:34.35]There you go.
[231:38.45]Can we make our own kingdom next door?
[231:40.17]Sure, but I'll just come destroy it.
[231:44.39]Does it have to be an active sub?
[231:45.57]Yes.
[231:49.47]If you guys go make your own kingdom, are you going to make your own kingdom?
[231:53.65]I don't think so.
[231:54.21]There's only one kingdom here.
[231:55.99]Me.
[231:58.60]I will squash this rebellion.
[232:00.77]If you do one, I will just squash it.
[232:10.83]We're going to rise up.
[232:14.31]Are you though?
[232:14.87]Because I'm not going to be a bad king.
[232:18.73]I'm going to come out and talk to the people and
[232:23.89]There'll be events.
[232:24.59]There are going to be events planned where, you know, we go and check out the garden that's being built and created.
[232:32.82]You just said, I'm going to be a very fair king.
[232:35.14]And you're going to get poisoned.
[232:37.42]No, I will not.
[232:37.99]There's going to be ten people in front of me that will eat before I do.
[232:47.25]I'm going to have a stash of 100 steaks the first 10 are going to be eaten by my royal king's guard and then I'll eat the 11th one to make sure it's not poisoned how's sleeping going to work so sleeping you can refill your stamina by sleeping and also eating you'll be doing it mostly by eating but if you lie down in a bed
[233:19.52]You will recharge at a very fast rate, but you have to lie there for at least a minute or two.
[233:25.34]You have to lie facing up at the ceiling for like a full 60 seconds.
[233:31.15]Potentially up to two minutes.
[233:34.65]Just lie down for like two years.
[233:46.51]You have to determine what you want to do for time.
[233:51.76]No, not everyone has to sleep at once.
[233:53.86]It can be tied to just the person's ID.
[233:55.94]That's not a problem.
[233:58.46]Until we're strong enough to kill.
[234:06.49]Just sleep your whole life.
[234:07.89]You could do that if you wanted to.
[234:09.83]You could spawn in as a baby, slowly with four or five other babies, build a small baby house, make a bed, and lie in it until you die.
[234:29.08]can sleep at any time it's just simply a way to make you have to not participate you know what I'm saying you have if you lie down for if if a bunch of people have to lie down for 60 seconds two minutes you are that's not time that you're storming the front gates with your with your knives you got to play by the rules if you have zero stamina you can still move around that's fine
[234:57.25]You can still walk.
[234:58.01]You can still punch.
[234:58.69]You can still grab.
[234:59.49]You can still build.
[235:01.37]You just do it at a times five slower rate.
[235:05.12]You could be walking around at zero stamina and you swing at minus 200% speed.
[235:16.15]What's the point of the server when you die within the first hour?
[235:18.85]That's not going to happen.
[235:20.97]You guys don't know the things that I know.
[235:23.73]I know a lot of things.
[235:25.91]That's not going to happen.
[235:28.73]There is no chance in hell that I die in the first hour of this dream.
[235:33.20]Not a chance in hell.
[235:35.64]You guys are gonna be babies.
[235:39.42]What, you're gonna surround me?
[235:41.38]500 babies are gonna surround the castle?
[235:44.31]That's not gonna happen.
[235:46.55]I can see it.
[235:48.15]I could look out my window and see the baby Zerg rush and know what's gonna happen.
[236:07.80]it going to be a 2b2 I don't know what that style q I don't know what that means this the queue system the server is being handled by incredibly competent people so there they know exactly what they're doing this is not the first time they've done large scale servers they have they have a lot of experience so they I'm assuming if it's something that would be good it's there
[236:36.33]They actually are very, very highly qualified.
[236:39.17]We'll just put it that way.
[236:47.66]Imagine the lag.
[236:48.84]That's another thing that we've already talked about that we've already figured out.
[236:52.26]There is going to be selective rendering.
[236:55.22]So if you are standing in your house, you are not going to render what's happening at the castle because you don't have to.
[237:13.05]Do the Kingsguard get fancy outfits?
[237:14.63]Of course they do.
[237:18.82]That's default to Minecraft.
[237:20.22]Yeah, see?
[237:33.83]How will Redstone work?
[237:34.83]I don't think there's going to be Redstone.
[237:43.89]There's actually talk of being able to not render people that are under two or three years old if the server load gets too big.
[237:54.49]There's a lot of stuff, and these are very powerful servers, too.
[237:57.60]Like I said, this is not... I didn't just go to servers.com and buy one.
[238:09.85]They're very, very, very powerful servers.
[238:18.89]invisible ghost baby rush is there a currency no that's something that we might want to do eventually though remember it has to work first it has to work and this was just based off of some just stupid idea about World of Warcraft and not doing anything and just having people play the game around me and it just it became a stream
[238:44.54]this is just we I gotta I gotta paddle right now and I'm just kind of paddling around somewhere in water that I've never been in I think this is gonna be a lot of fun and expect after the first one for some of the I see a lot of people saying hey what about this what about uh the currency what about uh what are the titles gonna do
[239:15.74]In the future, we will have lots of things.
[239:19.98]It does have a lot of potential.
[239:23.14]Okay, I will just say this.
[239:27.58]It will be worth doing once just to see what happens.
[239:32.53]That's worth it to me.
[239:35.35]Regardless of how time intensive, how many people are involved, how much money or resources, I think it's just worth trying.
[239:43.07]It should be fun.
[239:50.57]I'm pogging so fucking hard right now.
[239:58.65]I refuse to let this die after one attempt.
[240:07.59]What's the kingdom's name?
[240:09.71]That's something I haven't even thought of.
[240:13.25]I don't know.
[240:13.71]I have to think about that.
[240:17.88]JermaCraft.
[240:22.28]We'll figure that out.
[240:27.38]But the next thing that you need to hear is when Sunday comes along, the stream is going to be starting, I believe, at about 4 p.m.
[240:36.71]Pacific.
[240:38.90]We still haven't locked that down 100%, but it doesn't really matter because the first at least two to three hours before it and the first hour of the stream being live, we're going to be getting people in position to start.
[240:57.05]This is not going to be a case of, okay, the stream is on.
[241:00.33]Okay, let's go.
[241:00.83]Get in the server.
[241:02.28]Let's go.
[241:02.60]Are you guys ready?
[241:05.12]No, this is going to be at least an hour of getting people in.
[241:11.75]This is on Sunday.
[241:12.45]Sunday afternoon Pacific.
[241:20.45]Sunday the 15th.
[241:22.61]That's the next time you will see me live.
[241:25.62]I will be around in the Discord.
[241:28.36]If you are very interested in this, hang out in the Discord over the next couple of days.
[241:33.72]Because I'm going to be around for three days straight here.
[241:36.26]I'll give updates.
[241:37.14]I will tell you guys more things that are being added.
[241:39.86]Maybe some things that might have to change last second.
[241:43.37]If you would like to keep up to date with that, I'm just going to make another channel.
[241:48.69]It's just going to be FTK.
[241:50.93]And it's just going to be just info.
[241:52.61]And if there's any server info and stuff like that, it'll be there.
[241:58.27]You're going to leak the plans.
[242:03.10]What is this?
[242:05.96]Here's the attack plan.
[242:07.78]Let's see what the attack plan is.
[242:11.39]Let's go over this incredibly flawed plan.
[242:13.39]What do you say?
[242:14.07]Okay, let's see.
[242:39.98]jermaWalk path.
[242:41.32]Bait location.
[242:42.50]Swordsmen are hiding in the houses.
[242:44.22]Archers at the top.
[242:45.88]Swordsmen and archers attack Jerma.
[242:47.32]Baby swarm blocks retreat path and attack from behind.
[242:49.93]Base of operation.
[242:56.17]Yeah, guys.
[242:56.93]Do it.
[242:57.81]Do it.
[242:59.61]Form alliances.
[243:03.45]Make plans.
[243:05.13]Do it.
[243:06.38]I really, really want you to.
[243:08.58]Good luck.
[243:13.21]You're going to need it.
[243:20.92]Dirt Dick Alliance.
[243:25.06]But that's the plan.
[243:29.00]Any other questions, we will go over them in the Discord.
[243:33.83]I just wanted to give a basic understanding of how this is going to work.
[243:37.95]Is there a jail?
[243:38.75]No, not yet.
[243:39.83]Not in the first one.
[243:43.75]Think of the first one as an experiment, like I said before.
[243:46.07]It's the first iteration of an alpha, essentially.
[243:52.64]And I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[243:56.00]Good luck.
[243:58.86]See you in the Discord, possibly.
[244:01.90]Good luck.
[244:04.46]And that's going to be it for me.
[244:07.80]Be prepared.
[244:08.66]Oh, I've been preparing for the last three, four weeks.
[244:16.04]You don't think that I have some tricks up my sleeve?
[244:23.55]What, I'm just going to die?
[244:26.69]You don't think I have things in place?
[244:29.83]You don't think I have my own plans?
[244:32.63]You don't think I know these things?
[244:35.35]I ain't just going to let you walk in the front door.
[244:37.37]I ain't going to let you just come in the back door.
[244:40.77]It's not going to happen.
[244:44.88]Good luck.
[244:47.80]But I'll see you on Sunday.
[244:49.52]We'll give it a try.
[244:50.90]That's the next time you'll see me.
[244:55.19]Thanks for hanging out for the Game Awards.
[244:58.41]Let's get some music on here, huh?
[245:10.12]He's gonna play self-destruct buttons.
[245:17.12]Maybe.
[245:20.02]But, thank you for watching.
[245:21.54]See you Sunday.
[245:22.06]4 p.m.
[245:25.40]Pacific.
[245:27.13]Great Canadian Fuck Club thanks to the five community subs right now.
[245:30.57]There was also, I think I saw, yeah, Great Canadian Fuck Club gave 5,000 bits on top of the subs.
[245:38.37]$50 from Great Canadian.
[245:39.33]Jerma, King of the Andals, the Reuner, and the Short Men.
[245:46.88]Thank you, Great Canadian, for your massive contribution here.
[245:51.11]Thank you.
[245:52.37]10, 20, 15 community subs at least.
[245:58.03]And $50.
[245:58.49]He's short.
[246:08.79]Splarg, thanks for the five community subs.
[246:10.49]I think we got it.

[246:55.69]There's no doubt you make the world a brighter place.
[246:57.81]Thank you for all the laughs.
[246:58.69]We all appreciate it more than you may think.
[247:00.73]Love you.
[247:02.43]Thank you, Maddie.
[247:05.53]I don't need any awards.

[247:18.91]Thank you Tay Pan for the 300 bits 300 bits No message just a three dollars.
[247:25.09]Thank you Sad Vega.
[247:26.87]Thanks for 300 bits.
[247:27.73]My heart broke hearing you say you will never play Luigi's Mansion 3 My ADHD and obsessive compulsive nature makes me unable to complete that game Unfortunately Malto thanks for the 500 bits Thank You Malto 69
[247:48.23]Imagine a game so big it actually sells as its own console to fit all its content.
[247:57.27]That would have to be... That's... That would have to be a very big game.
[248:11.06]VR.
[248:12.86]Well, VR was only just a live-in-your-house simulator.
[248:20.45]Uh, thank you, Platadonius.
[248:21.95]Platadinius, thanks for the 500 bits.
[248:24.34]Vin Diesel had to lean down to speak into the microphone because he's tall.
[248:27.84]Jerma, that's just how it is for people over six feet tall.
[248:30.98]That microphone was probably four and a half feet off the ground.
[248:38.13]Vin Diesel is 5'10".
[248:39.25]Okay.
[248:43.61]Thank you, Castalion, or Castlion, for the 300 bits.
[248:47.88]Hey, Jermo, I hope this TGA show, though awful, convinces you to try Disco Elysium in the future.
[248:53.65]I'd love to see you as a terrible degenerate detective and as very little conflict.
[248:59.09]Really?
[248:59.39]Well, if it's not constant conflict, why would I even want to play it?
[249:08.55]I even said the name wrong.
[249:13.05]Thank you, though.
[249:14.39]I'll have to give it a real look.
[249:16.79]Gnarly thanks to the 250.
[249:19.57]Sekiro was my game of the year, so I'm glad it won.
[249:21.75]Also, I guess I'm the only League of Legends player here because I'm super hyped for the new League of Legends platformer and RPG games, but no one else in chat is.
[249:31.06]Still was an underwhelming show, though.
[249:41.12]I don't even have an opinion.
[249:42.60]I don't play League.
[249:43.40]I don't really know the characters.
[249:44.40]I don't connect with the world.
[249:45.56]I don't know anything about it, so...
[249:50.58]thank you near shoe for the five community subs and again we had great canadian come in with a huge amount of money thank you canadian 25 Dr. pepper thanks for the 250 bits the king that's treason I want to be the king's friend you are the exact reason why I think people are very seriously overestimating how quickly I'm going to die
[250:18.38]remember you've only got like six ish plus hours in the server total you don't want to enjoy those six hours six plus maybe hours you want to come kill you but what if you're just gonna die you can't come back in you want to protect that person that keeps that going you want to protect my kingdom and me you get to stay around
[250:44.73]You rush the front door in the first 20, 30 minutes of the game, then you're just throwing away your game time and you can't come back.
[250:56.38]Think about it before you choose these things.
[251:09.24]What happens if everyone dies except the king?
[251:12.32]it's just going to pull the next people that are in the queue.
[251:17.91]Let's say there's 500 people that are allowed in the server, and 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 people all want to sign up at the same time.
[251:27.44]There'll always just be somebody else that can replace.
[251:34.44]And like I said previously, if it gets to a point where we're out of potential players, we can wipe the slate clean and just do it again.
[251:47.60]If there's no more people left in the queue, then we'll just refresh it.
[251:56.19]You know, we may even... It really just depends on how many people actually try.
[252:02.05]1.8.
[252:02.51]Version of Minecraft is 1.8.
[252:06.63]Is there going to be a queue waiting room?
[252:07.78]Yes.
[252:09.30]It'll be separate from the actual server.
[252:22.07]Is it going to replace normal streams?
[252:27.15]I don't know what you mean by the word replace.
[252:33.75]It's just a stream.
[252:40.12]Is there an age limit?
[252:41.12]100 and you die.
[252:47.00]I imagine this would be something I would want to do at least once a week.
[252:49.99]For the first... Do it three or four times and see how it goes?
[252:57.78]Even if I die.
[252:58.34]Do you age when offline?
[253:00.94]No.
[253:02.38]You do not.
[253:04.37]And we're going to make sure, this is just to add to what we were saying before, in that initial queue lobby system, I'm going to make sure that there are a shitload of rules that are just put there for you to read and kind of compress them in at your own pace.
[253:25.81]What happens when I die?
[253:26.97]When I die, it's over and we do it again next week.
[253:32.17]Now, there are some rules where if I die certain ways, then I would just come back and reset it.
[253:38.63]Because if there is a weird disconnect issue, or if something happens to my game, or if there's an actual glitch or something and I shouldn't have died, then I come back.
[253:50.40]If I disconnect and I die because I was disconnected for too long, then no, the king isn't dead because he DC'd.
[254:05.83]He's gonna get crystal killed.
[254:07.17]No, there's no crystals!
[254:10.33]There's no crystals.
[254:11.45]There's only bows and swords and small melee weapons.
[254:15.16]You can't, like, create magic fucking potion bombs.
[254:27.44]We're gonna drop an anvil on him.
[254:38.21]Summon a wither on him.
[254:39.83]That doesn't exist.
[254:42.47]Only creepers, skeletons, and zombies are the only enemies that will exist in the world.
[254:52.12]No endermen, no magicians, no teleporting monsters that can... Oh, yeah, spiders.
[254:57.46]Yes, yes, yes.
[254:59.28]Just the basic enemies that don't have a special mechanic that instantly kills you and shit.
[255:06.12]None of that.
[255:09.26]Because we don't give a shit about that anyways.
[255:12.14]It's us that we care about.
[255:13.78]Not what monsters are spawnable.
[255:22.57]Let's keep going though.
[255:26.21]And again, questions, comments.
[255:29.73]I'm going to be around all day for the next few days.
[255:32.45]Jumping back and forth.
[255:34.01]I'll be in the Discord.
[255:34.82]I'll make a separate channel.
[255:35.78]We can talk.
[255:38.26]Go check it out.
[255:40.63]I want a graffiti of your castle.
[255:41.75]We'll give you buckets.
[255:42.59]Probably not immediately.
[255:49.68]But... Thank you, Goo Berry Juice!
[255:53.68]Why am I ruling a city of just babies?
[255:55.39]Whose babies are we?
[255:56.47]Did you kidnap us?
[255:57.39]Are you employing babies?
[256:02.09]No, it's not.
[256:02.99]It's just the time that you're in the server and it's in place to prevent immediate griefing of the immediate nature.
[256:14.71]I spawn, turn, and kill the guy standing next to me in five seconds of spawning.
[256:25.94]That's why it's there.
[256:30.96]It's Battle Royale.
[256:31.96]Yeah, I don't want this to turn into a BR.
[256:34.06]I don't want this to be baby BR.
[256:39.06]The first 10 to 20 minutes of your time in the game, you're almost 100% useless.
[256:52.53]This is just BR.
[256:55.09]Kind of.
[256:57.94]Thank you sly 161 for the 250 really looking forward to this Minecraft stream.
[257:01.44]Let me know if you need a royal food taste tester Yeah, we just got to get one off the ground first and then this can progress in a million ways Hey, phil white.
[257:15.29]Thanks with a thousand bits phil I'm, really excited to see what I can do to serve my king till I'm old of age But in reality I'm probably just going to be one of the bludgeoned babies during the dark age
[257:34.87]alright let's talk about something else real quick the first few hundred people that come into the server you're the pioneers it is the dark times it is the pioneering stage of this game because you are the first whoever comes after you is going to have seen what happened to you
[258:01.23]And they are going to have to maybe change their game plan a little.
[258:08.26]Everyone in that first wave.
[258:12.14]I don't know what's going to happen.
[258:16.22]It is not going to be a persistent server.
[258:18.86]We're going to save state the server when the stream turns off.
[258:22.20]And turn it on the next time.
[258:35.46]Are there going to be secrets?
[258:38.56]Yeah, I've... Yes.
[258:39.98]Yes.
[258:40.90]I want to eventually... This is all eventually stuff.
[258:45.52]I want to add little missions that people can go on.
[258:49.81]Any way that I can distract you.
[258:56.25]This is called Fuck the King.
[258:59.87]But what if things are more interesting than Fuck the King?
[259:05.18]I don't know.
[259:06.62]We'll see.
[259:09.86]Distracting us from the slaughter.
[259:15.94]Yep.
[259:18.46]Hey, Sad Vega, thanks again for the thousand bits.
[259:20.58]I cannot wait to watch this shitshow play out.
[259:23.02]Here's some more bits to the cause.
[259:25.06]Hoping I can get in on this.
[259:26.02]Do you plan to do other games for FTK?
[259:30.47]I'd love to see a Conan version.
[259:34.86]The idea is there.
[259:36.48]Minecraft was just the easiest to have a bunch of people in.
[259:41.33]You're aware this is going to be an unmitigated disaster, correct?
[259:45.37]Yeah.
[259:47.05]I wouldn't have this any other way.
[259:53.44]That's sort of intentional, I think.
[259:55.76]I think that's part of the plan.
[260:01.06]If it goes completely smoothly, and it's...
[260:04.51]It's almost unexpected at this point.
[260:09.60]All babies move north to build Dirt Dick City.
[260:11.98]We will create an opposing civilization, gain strength, improving our weapons and armor.
[260:15.86]Then we will come commence the assault on the kingdom.
[260:22.45]Don't tell me.
[260:22.89]You're going to tell me what your plan is.
[260:29.13]Again, I don't know what you guys are doing.
[260:32.83]There's going to be a bunch of cameras that we're cutting to that are showing the world, zooming in on stuff, seeing an interesting thing happening in the town or outside in the wilderness.
[260:40.88]I don't know those things.
[260:41.84]I'm playing the game with you.
[260:46.17]If you guys made a new civilization that I didn't know about, how would I ever know it existed in the first place?
[260:53.45]If I find out about it, oh, you're fucked.
[261:10.15]Is the town destructible?
[261:13.14]I don't think so.
[261:15.40]Not immediately.
[261:16.42]I think certain things can be destroyed.
[261:22.14]We're not sure yet.
[261:23.16]We're trying to see how that would all work.
[261:27.14]I don't think you can build in the city.
[261:31.36]We decided to do that to keep it pretty clear.
[261:34.48]And the out of bounds area...
[261:37.79]is more designed for you to kind of make your own little houses and have your own little communities and stuff.
[261:44.35]And the actual town with the castles and the little shops and the walkways, that's more for participating in the game.
[262:00.14]What does the king do?
[262:00.94]Whatever I want.
[262:04.60]survive exist participate play engage all things yeah that's we're talking about like the capital to give you an idea the actual capital the town is I believe 2000 by 2000. and then outside of that is a much larger area
[262:40.52]It's pretty big.
[262:51.91]I just want to make a house and live with the Jermamites.
[263:00.00]I don't think that many players can play on that, on your idea.
[263:04.16]It is.
[263:09.62]Like I said, the people that are running this have a ton of experience with very large-scale servers.
[263:23.93]And there are plans for us to beat the ever-living shit out of these servers before we even try to have any players come on them.
[263:31.86]So, there are things we're going to be doing.
[263:35.64]And somebody just kind of wrote it.
[263:37.34]This is the stress test.
[263:40.10]right that's also true am I gonna play a game no not tonight this is the end of the stream here I'm literally I'm lit literally I'm gonna get off stream and just go right back to what I was doing before the stream started
[264:09.97]Shitty Viewbot, thanks for the 300 bits.
[264:11.35]I'm buying and installing Minecraft for the first time just for this occasion.
[264:14.71]You better not fuck this up.
[264:17.49]Jesus.
[264:21.62]Smellyboy, thanks for the 250.
[264:22.82]If I make a nice Minecraft farm, will the king come out and look at it and tell me how good of a farmer I am?
[264:29.16]Probably.
[264:32.17]Better not have any landmines under the corn.
[264:35.11]I'll be checking.
[264:43.59]He's gonna destroy it.
[264:48.58]Oh, man.
[264:49.18]Hey, Permanent Marks, thanks for the 250.
[264:51.00]Can I exchange these bits for bald coin currency in Minecraft?
[264:56.21]No, I'm sorry.
[264:57.99]Gromicus, thanks for the 300 bits.
[264:59.39]Hey, Jerma, my little nephew Tucker is your biggest fan.
[265:01.45]Can you please shout him out as...
[265:18.64]Tucker It's there's a I think this is different language, I don't know what's what is it I Don't know is this He's searching right now what this is It says please shout him out as this the this I

[266:05.18]He can't.
[266:06.08]Alright, it's T-U-C-E space.
[266:16.75]What's that?
[266:20.90]And then D, D, E. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[266:29.22]What is that?
[266:29.91]What is that?
[266:38.11]Why are you guys writing that?
[266:39.23]Why are you guys writing that?
[266:46.52]Okay, yep.
[266:50.13]Thank you agromicus for the 300 bits.
[266:53.82]You see those questions people write in the question marks.
[266:55.60]What's he talking about?
[266:56.28]What's he doing?
[267:00.52]Do you understand?
[267:05.48]Thank you panda poploin for the 500 bits.
[267:08.30]I made a YouTube playlist of all Jerma videos and streams and called it jermaTV.
[267:12.67]It's got 805 videos and a total runtime length of 2,916 hours.
[267:23.37]or 121 days.
[267:25.81]If you were to start that playlist as it is now and leave it running, it would finish on April 11th, 2020.
[267:31.05]Holy shit.
[267:37.08]That's an interesting bunch of facts here.
[267:44.68]3000 hours, pretty much.
[267:45.63]Well, here it is, if anyone's curious.
[267:48.67]Just start that and then, you know, finish it on the Cyberpunk release date.
[267:51.61]Yeah, that's right.
[267:59.79]Just in time.
[268:03.39]Thank you for that, Panda.
[268:04.68]That's actually really cool.
[268:05.48]I've never seen that data presented to me before.
[268:10.92]Interesting to think about that.
[268:12.00]121 and a half days of video footage.
[268:21.67]Very cool.
[268:23.57]sock chart thanks for 500 bits please help I don't know what pog or jubated is and no one will tell me I can help you pog is holy and jubated is we got him laughing done that's all you need to know apple shift thanks for the 250.
[268:44.54]Hey man, today I quit my shitty job, which is kind of bittersweet since I'll miss my coworkers.
[268:48.84]But hey, here's 250 to new beginnings.
[268:52.10]Plus I'll be able to catch more streams now, which is great.
[268:54.62]P.S.
[268:55.02]I've got to go to a thing on Sunday, so I won't be able to make the Minecraft stream.
[268:59.58]But I'll be there for the next one for sure.
[269:00.92]Godspeed, good sir.
[269:02.63]Best of luck to you.
[269:04.19]Best of luck to you.
[269:06.45]Seems like a pretty major change.
[269:09.27]Best of luck to you.
[269:11.45]Godspeed to you as well.
[269:18.92]Thanks for the 250.
[269:21.96]Let's hope you start something else soon here.
[269:25.45]Something that you're more happy with.
[269:29.91]Thanks again for the 250.
[269:30.45]Yes, you have to protect me at all costs.
[269:34.93]Murderous babies.
[269:56.99]This streamer is fucked.
[269:58.41]Hey, the Dinkster, thanks for the 500 bits.
[270:02.53]I like this man.
[270:05.07]I'm happy you do.
[270:06.65]Thank you.
[270:09.33]That's the end, guys.
[270:13.97]No, it's not.
[270:14.63]I forgot about the credits.
[270:15.77]What am I thinking?
[270:16.25]I'm too caught up with all the other stuff going on.
[270:28.35]Ow, ow, ow.
[270:29.53]Holy shit, there were a lot of subs.
[270:37.01]Holy... I'm looking over at how many people subbed today.
[270:39.96]That's a lot.
[270:44.20]It's because of the server.
[270:46.04]Yeah, but you... There's no... You need to be subbed for... For the first one, you have to be subbed for two months.
[270:55.43]That might pull back when we do another one.
[271:01.84]Are they going to be baby player models or are we just going to be the same size?
[271:05.24]I believe it's going to be a different model for the first 30, 40 minutes of your life.
[271:16.62]That was still tentative when we talked earlier, so I'm not sure.
[271:22.16]People didn't realize the event was in three days.
[271:38.21]Two months in a row or total?
[271:39.63]Two months in a row.
[271:43.26]Yeah, I had that on... I had that on screen.
[271:45.74]I had that on screen for like 40 minutes.
[271:48.72]It said two plus months.
[271:53.32]In a row.
[272:01.60]Barely made it.
[272:10.56]Do they have to be an active sub?
[272:14.06]Yeah, remember, the whole purpose of doing it, we've talked about it three or four times already here.
[272:19.70]The point of having it be two plus subs is because if somebody catches the stream and they say, oh, wait, you're telling me I can just, I could pay $5 and try to ruin a server?
[272:33.95]That's the point.
[272:36.16]to make it so nobody can, at least on the first one, it's a preventative measure.
[272:43.06]You know what I'm saying?
[272:50.59]They need to pay $10 for two straight months.
[272:55.17]So, good.
[272:56.39]Alright.
[272:57.15]In two months from now, if you wanted to pay five bucks and try to ruin the server,
[273:10.11]We're also still working on that too.
[273:17.14]It just had to be in place.
[273:19.24]It's just too, it's too exploitable.
[273:21.64]It just is.
[273:22.30]I really didn't want to do it, but it had to be done.
[273:37.35]I honestly would have done six months.
[273:41.20]I think that's too much.
[273:50.76]The subs have to exist.
[273:52.88]And I'm not even sure there's that many six-month straight subs.
[274:05.71]At that point, it would be six months total.
[274:09.59]But I'm not sure.
[274:10.81]It might be hard to pull that data.
[274:14.63]But as it stands right now, you have to have been subbed for two months.
[274:18.59]Like the last 60 days, essentially.
[274:29.02]I'm a 17-month sub repeat sub, but it doesn't count because it's prime?
[274:33.80]That's not true.
[274:42.15]Yeah, of course.
[274:43.31]Yeah, prime subs count.
[274:44.27]Of course they do.
[274:52.20]Yeah, yeah, no.
[274:53.50]Prime counts.
[274:56.48]You just had to have been subscribed.
[274:58.90]It's not... Yeah, that's fine.
[275:06.97]Uh-oh, the babies have doubled.
[275:11.70]So if it says my current streak is nine months, even though I missed my last sub by a few days, I'm fine.
[275:16.45]Yeah, it should be fine.
[275:18.73]It's just pulling what Twitch is reporting out, right?
[275:32.62]The streak window is like 40 days.
[275:35.86]Yeah, so that's fine.
[275:43.62]People are gonna be really salty in chat when they die.
[275:47.80]Yeah, but that's kind of inevitable though.
[275:50.10]Alright, look.
[275:52.68]You're... Look, listen.
[275:57.08]You're gonna die, okay?
[275:59.44]It's just gonna happen.
[276:01.96]You're gonna die.
[276:03.52]If you join the server, you're dead.
[276:08.86]Maybe not, but you have to go in with... Wow, really?
[276:13.28]No, I'm just saying.
[276:15.32]This is chaos.
[276:18.53]You can't go into the server and be like, I can't wait to live a long, fruitful life in here.
[276:23.79]It's gonna be anarchy.
[276:25.75]It's going to be controlled anarchy, but I can't guarantee you that you'll last 10 seconds or you'll last 5 hours.
[276:33.37]I don't know.
[276:34.01]I don't know.
[276:40.84]You need to have a gravekeeper for all the deaths.
[276:48.07]So, I hope you don't get upset if you spawn in and within 20 minutes you haven't been fed and somebody kills you.
[276:57.96]I'm sorry.
[277:06.34]I'm gonna do my best to run the kingdom as well as I can.
[277:12.75]And that's... If you're watching the stream, I know, oh, I wish I could participate, but it might even be more fun if you just watch.
[277:22.39]This is going to be an absolute joke of the stream.
[277:25.34]Potentially more than three or four times.
[277:34.54]See you Sunday, though.
[277:37.51]Join the Discord.
[277:38.13]There'll be a channel there soon.
[277:40.88]to talk about this stream.
[277:45.15]Have fun.
[277:46.37]Because that's all I care about.
[277:47.43]See you soon.
[278:09.06]Thank you.
[278:43.94]you
