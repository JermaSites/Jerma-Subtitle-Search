[00:01.07]Can you hear me?
[00:06.95]Alright.
[00:08.91]Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:11.03]How are you?
[00:13.45]How are you?
[00:18.69]Early?
[00:19.09]No, I am... I'm a full hour late.
[00:24.34]And one could even argue I'm two days late.
[00:28.02]But I'm here.
[00:30.56]I am now officially fully vaccinated, so I hope I don't have any side effects in the middle of the stream.
[00:39.11]That's kind of why I said it's going to be maybe three hours, because we'll see.
[00:45.84]I'm anxiously anticipating what that's going to look like.
[00:56.50]What did you say about my testicles?
[01:04.06]Fully vaccinated.
[01:04.82]I don't know.
[01:05.96]You said something about my testicles after being vaccinated.
[01:08.52]I don't know.
[01:09.14]I have no idea what you meant by that.
[01:10.85]I didn't even read the whole thing.
[01:21.45]Just pretend that the vaccine is the reason you're acting zonked.
[01:25.95]Yeah, I have a few things to talk about.
[01:28.42]Well, one in particular.
[01:30.10]Thursday.
[01:31.90]Well, let's just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:32.92]We gotta wait.
[01:33.36]Did I even tweet anything?
[01:34.25]I didn't tweet anything.
[01:34.85]Hold on, give me a second.
[01:36.85]Let me tweet something.
[01:37.39]I'll be right back.
[02:37.74]So today, this is going to be the last... This is going to be the last day of VR for a little while.
[02:42.25]I have to put this in a box for a little bit.
[02:46.61]Some of you probably have known by the amount of times I have taken in between these days.
[02:50.61]VR seems to royally fuck me up.
[02:56.15]Something about holding my arms up for more than a few hours, even with the brace on, it just fucking annihilates me.
[03:03.48]So...
[03:05.34]We're going to put it away for a little while.
[03:06.90]I'm probably going to do more seated VR in the future.
[03:09.18]I'm not going to do seated VR today because the whole goddamn living room has been cleared.
[03:13.86]And this would have been a waste of time if I didn't utilize the living room space.
[03:20.59]You know what I mean?
[03:22.09]I'll be fine.
[03:22.59]I got my brace on.
[03:23.29]I'll be alright.
[03:26.59]But let's talk about some announcements.
[03:29.61]This Thursday, so in a couple days...
[03:32.55]Ludwig and I are going to be hosting a battleship tournament, which we will be participating in as well.
[03:40.41]I'm not going to make any bets.
[03:41.89]If I lose, I'm just going to fucking walk away and lose.
[03:45.17]We're not adding anything.
[03:46.15]I'm not doing any... No.
[03:47.50]If I'm out, I'm just out of the tournament.
[03:49.66]That's it.
[03:51.72]So that's going to be on Ludwig's channel.
[03:54.82]I'll be hosting him, and I'll be part of the commentator team.
[03:58.58]And then this weekend on Sunday...
[04:01.56]You don't want to miss that one.
[04:03.48]Just want to let you know ahead of time.
[04:06.33]I'm going to be making a very, very large announcement on Sunday.
[04:12.65]So, if I were you, if there's a stream that you might want to participate in, at least for a little while, is the announcement of the announcement stream.
[04:22.11]Here it is.
[04:24.03]That's on the first.
[04:27.81]It's not Catboy.
[04:29.11]Nope.
[04:30.50]Oh, no, it's... No, it is not Catboy.
[04:34.46]Just wait until you motherfuckers know what that is.
[04:39.69]It's not Catboy.
[04:40.69]No, it's not.
[04:41.91]Trust me.
[04:42.93]This is something... Whatever.
[04:44.19]I'll see you on Sunday.
[04:47.83]We'll be back in... Actually sitting down at the chair.
[04:51.33]Regular setup.
[04:53.27]But... I think we can... We can go here.
[04:57.86]I don't need to delay anymore.
[04:58.78]Already delayed enough.
[05:01.42]In the event that, like, I start to get, like, a massive headache or something from this vaccine, I'm just going to run away.
[05:07.99]I'm going to be like, guys, bye.
[05:10.33]And I'm going to immediately lie down.
[05:11.57]I'm going to do, like, the Undertaker in my bed.
[05:12.93]I'm just going to lie down and just stay straight.
[05:16.37]Let's turn the camera on.
[05:17.19]What do you say?
[05:23.58]Okay.
[05:29.72]Um...
[05:32.96]This is Medal of Honor Andy.
[05:47.29]What?
[05:47.43]The name of the game is Medal of Honor Andy.
[05:49.79]I hope you guys are ready.
[06:04.50]They may as well.
[06:05.72]Honest to God, seriously.
[06:09.14]At this point, like, you may, what am I connected to here?
[06:13.57]Medal of Honor Andy is the name of this game, I guess.
[06:17.25]Alright, can you guys hear it?
[06:22.19]Is it a good sound for you?
[06:23.37]Does it sound good?
[06:25.15]Because I'm ready to go.
[06:27.06]This is the one, I remember like E3, like two, maybe two E3s ago or last E3 from last year.
[06:34.50]I remember seeing this game being announced and I was like, holy shit, I can't wait to play this.
[06:38.80]So I'm actually pretty excited to play this game.
[06:43.21]Should I be excited?
[06:45.17]This game sucks, by the way.
[06:46.71]Glad that's the first thing that I read.
[06:51.62]Alright, let's go.
[06:52.64]Here we go.
[06:53.40]Medal of Honor, Andy.
[06:54.42]Am I in the right place?
[06:58.82]I haven't turned around that many times, have I?
[07:06.26]Oh my god, that just scared the shit out of me!
[07:08.28]I feel pretty good!
[07:09.52]Do you not know what this is?
[07:11.90]This is universal for I'm doing just fine.
[07:16.06]Okay.
[07:16.82]Am I supposed to be sitting down?
[07:35.32]Oh shit!
[07:36.66]Oops!
[07:37.26]Grab the pistol and shoot.
[07:38.31]Who, you?
[07:45.94]Oh my, oh my.
[07:47.12]I mean, great, Captain.
[07:48.04]Watch out!
[07:48.40]Is that Harry Potter?
[07:48.96]Grab the pistol and shoot.
[07:50.70]Look out!
[07:51.02]There's a bad guy!
[08:24.99]It took like half an hour to get out of this fucking tutorial.
[08:29.45]I'm so- Alright, I promise I won't do it again.
[08:35.12]I'm not gonna do it again!
[08:35.98]Why can you do that?!
[08:39.08]Um...
[08:55.39]Got him.
[08:56.21]I'm putting it down.
[08:58.99]Why can you do that?
[09:06.57]What?
[09:06.79]Where did that guy even come from?
[09:07.83]Is that guy flying?
[09:09.19]That guy was in like one of those squirrel suits.
[09:13.22]Get the- I don't know.
[09:13.98]Don't- Hey!
[09:16.86]He's like pointing at my head!
[09:18.14]He was up- No, where was he?
[09:30.75]I love how my head is just in here.
[09:32.01]Oh, wait.
[09:33.53]I got to do... Why am I... How's the audio?
[09:38.80]Can you hear it?
[09:40.06]Can't hear it?
[09:41.28]There you go.
[10:01.07]Home turf.
[10:02.43]We do some of the most dangerous work of the war.
[10:04.71]We're looking for people just like you.
[10:06.49]Can I have that hat?
[10:07.51]Now the sergeant and I go way back.
[10:09.43]They're like all around me.
[10:10.61]It's weird.
[10:11.45]And for what you did in Tunisia, he's nominated you for the Medal of Honor.
[10:17.90]Trust me, Lieutenant.
[10:19.68]I hate doing paperwork.
[10:21.64]But in your case, I made an exception.
[10:25.12]You saved our lives.
[10:26.50]You're welcome.
[10:27.22]Thank you.
[10:27.58]You guys did good too.
[10:29.46]Life is usually a pageant of idiots and fools.
[10:33.16]But occasionally, you find yourself in the company of good people.
[10:36.86]And then, anything is possible.
[10:40.58]Lieutenant, you are now going to hear the most important question I can ask.
[10:44.72]Would you like to join the OSS?
[10:48.14]Give a thumbs up or thumbs down to proceed.
[10:50.09]What?
[10:50.27]Should I join?
[10:54.66]Thumbs down?
[10:55.16]I don't think so.
[10:59.70]Not today.
[11:00.76]I understand, Lieutenant.
[11:02.38]As soon as you're back on your feet, we'll have you on a transport for New York.
[11:06.98]Game over?
[11:08.05]Thumbs down?
[11:08.81]Wait, is that it?
[11:12.45]Did I speedrun losing the game?
[11:14.47]Wait, that's the end of the game!
[11:17.91]Are you kidding me?
[11:25.06]Um, I don't... What do I do now?
[11:39.31]What is this?
[11:40.89]Gallery?
[11:44.93]Introduction to the gallery.
[11:46.21]What is going on?
[11:46.99]How do I... Go back 10 seconds.
[11:52.74]How do I... What do I do?
[11:54.53]Can I go over there?
[11:56.69]Main menu.
[12:00.61]What happened?
[12:05.48]Missions.
[12:07.90]Stay alive, okay, this is, right here.
[12:11.52]Welcome to the OSS, I wanna join it.
[12:14.26]Okay, here we go.
[12:22.31]Yes, I would like to join.
[12:24.69]I'm joining the OSS.
[12:25.75]Thank you.
[12:27.80]Why is there a gun here?
[12:32.18]Come on, blink again.
[12:32.72]No, blink again.
[12:33.42]I want to change my... Whatever.
[12:47.74]Welcome to the infirmary.
[12:48.56]You can set your game options in this interactive mode.
[12:50.56]You can also do it anytime.
[12:51.66]Okay, whatever.
[12:52.22]Interactive exam?
[12:53.28]Sure.
[12:53.42]I am right-handed.
[13:12.76]Ah, fantastic.
[13:13.76]Use the gun.
[13:14.32]I can't.
[13:14.80]Let's confirm your fine motor skills.
[13:17.08]Please, pick up the service weapon next to you.
[13:19.46]No.
[13:20.30]No.
[13:21.24]No.
[13:22.48]No.
[13:23.90]No.
[13:25.22]Yes.
[13:25.46]Splendid.
[13:27.07]Now, give me a thumbs up if you're ready to continue, or a thumbs down if you want to change your selection.
[13:34.65]No, that's fine.
[13:35.17]I like that.
[13:35.53]Well done, Lieutenant.
[13:37.17]On to the next question.
[13:39.59]We put blanks in your gun because you're a psycho.
[13:41.46]Turn that off immediately.
[13:42.42]Turn it off.
[13:42.66]Ugh.
[13:42.76]I want zero.
[14:04.82]Zero.
[14:05.98]None.
[14:06.94]The worst thing to put in any game.
[14:08.02]Yeah, why would you want camera shake?
[14:09.94]This game lets you kill the soldiers in the prologue, but not the doctor.
[14:14.70]I was very jarring that you could do that.
[14:34.55]Now, let's discuss how you want to view an enemy's threat level.
[14:42.56]Now, see the two imaginary enemies in front of you?
[14:45.90]Yes.
[14:46.52]Note how their threat level is indicated above their heads.
[14:49.29]Their threat levels?
[14:50.27]The more stars they have, the bigger the threat.
[14:53.55]An enemy with one star should be easy for you to dispatch.
[14:56.81]Is this like World of Warcraft zones?
[15:00.73]Seeing an enemy's threat level from a distance gives you the chance to adjust your tactics accordingly.
[15:06.23]I have a question.
[15:06.77]If I shoot him in the head, it still kills him, right?
[15:09.43]Now, some of the technicians in the back say this affects immersion.
[15:12.99]I just burped and I hope you all heard it, but I don't.
[15:17.23]Lieutenant, please choose if you'd like to see the enemy threat level.
[15:20.88]What do you think?
[15:21.36]No?
[15:23.16]I don't think so, right?
[15:24.84]I'm skipping the checkup.
[15:25.94]Get me out of here.
[15:27.40]I am always here, Lieutenant, so please, come back any time.
[15:31.18]You can access my office through the main menu.
[15:33.80]Good luck and tally-ho.
[15:35.70]Tally-ho.
[15:42.44]Firing Ranger.
[15:43.00]Alright, this is where we're going to learn how to play.
[15:45.24]Remember, every VR game wants you to see how cool they have their reload feature.
[15:50.00]Oh my god, that was cool.
[15:52.38]Alright, right sleeve is current objective.
[15:55.48]Follow the tutorial prompts.
[15:56.56]Okay.
[16:16.74]Cool.
[16:17.22]That feels pretty good.
[16:18.56]Ooh.
[16:19.14]I like that a lot.
[16:21.02]Okay.
[16:21.26]Controls are pretty good.
[16:23.02]I'm going to give it that.
[16:24.38]The controls are pretty good.
[16:49.11]He hates the game, and any game that's not Alyx.
[16:51.25]That's not true, but it is a little bit.
[16:52.95]Alright, basic training.
[16:54.12]Down here?
[16:54.50]Oh, cool.
[16:54.82]What do we got?
[17:18.05]Why are you so much bigger than me?
[17:20.63]Press this button.
[17:21.72]Ooh, okay.
[17:23.98]That's pretty fun.
[17:28.44]I'm not gonna shoot him!
[17:29.82]Alright, I'm not...
[17:49.42]Ah, sick.
[17:51.01]Ooh.
[17:58.43]This actually, I like this.
[17:59.49]Alright, reach over the shoulder and grab.
[18:11.93]Oh, fuck.
[18:13.83]Okay.
[18:14.77]Grab the SMG.
[18:16.76]This is not an SMG.
[18:20.08]How do I get my SMG?
[18:21.88]Oh, there we go.
[18:29.76]You had to do it with two hands!
[18:40.04]Yeah, let me help you.
[18:48.00]We shouldn't be standing this close.
[18:51.93]Okay, put this in.
[19:12.73]You shouldn't be this close, your ears would be bleeding right now.
[19:15.75]How are your ears not bleeding?
[19:22.13]What?
[19:24.01]Alright, I'm fine.
[19:24.87]Alright, next station over here.
[19:29.15]Alright, I've got to be fair.
[19:30.49]I've got to be fair.
[19:50.35]Probably, out of all the games I've played in VR so far, all of them, that includes Alyx.
[19:56.06]It's, this works.
[20:01.68]This works, it works.
[20:03.44]It works just fine.
[20:04.68]And I have no problem with it.
[20:06.92]It works.
[20:09.38]Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
[20:11.62]Now get ammo for this K98 from these ammunition boxes.
[20:16.07]A box.
[20:17.91]Here we go.
[20:25.27]Don't do that!
[20:29.82]Don't do that!
[20:36.26]How do you do it?
[20:40.65]Okay.
[20:41.77]How do you reload it, though?
[20:42.77]So I can get mad at chat for getting mad at me two days ago.
[20:47.01]How do you do it?
[20:49.67]Okay, so people are fucking furious because I was using my left hand.
[20:53.38]Let me see.
[20:56.36]No, it doesn't work like that.
[20:57.50]Hold on.
[21:01.96]Okay.
[21:16.11]I like them both.
[21:19.75]You can have this.
[21:24.46]Med kit.
[21:25.04]I know you just got out of the infirmary, Lieutenant, but we need to give you a quick refresher on battlefield medicine.
[21:31.54]You will automatically heal from minor wounds, but if you really get hurt, you'll need to use some first aid.
[21:38.53]Pretend to hurt yourself by smashing your hand on these rusty nails.
[21:42.47]Doy, doy, doy.
[21:43.49]Wait, what?
[21:47.31]Simulate a grave injury.
[21:54.28]Sorry, I didn't press the button fast enough to make you get hurt.
[21:57.44]Now comes the fun part.
[21:59.40]Stab yourself in the chest.
[22:01.62]The syringe will auto-inject the medicine.
[22:05.52]Oh my god, that's fucked up.
[22:07.88]Voila!
[22:08.02]Good as new.
[22:08.94]You can store up to three first aid syringes on your cuff.
[22:11.67]Where?
[22:12.11]On my cuff.
[22:13.03]There is smoke now onto grenades.
[22:14.95]Head up the stairs.
[22:17.83]I like that.
[22:18.65]You gotta give him credit where credit is due.
[22:21.25]You have to.
[22:22.60]I'm giving him credit.
[22:23.24]Everyone said this game sucks.
[22:25.49]So far, this is very fluid.
[22:29.85]Easy to grab shit.
[22:31.13]Nothing fucking freaks out.
[22:33.03]I like it.
[22:34.13]I might change my mind in like 10 minutes.
[22:38.07]This is very important how cool the grenades.
[22:43.35]What?
[22:44.46]What?
[22:53.44]I thought if I hold the thing down, it... Oh, a steilhand.
[22:58.77]A steilhand.
[22:59.41]Does it count down?
[23:03.67]Why was it not counting down?
[23:05.33]Did you see?
[23:05.81]It was counting down before.
[23:06.83]It was like three, two... Oh, okay.
[23:16.72]Oh, God.
[23:19.42]What about the steilhand?
[23:20.92]You can use your hand or your teeth.
[23:28.46]You- you can.
[23:29.55]Excellent.
[23:31.33]You're ready to take on the Third Reich.
[23:37.05]When you're done with grenades, head on down the stairs.
[23:44.68]What are you gonna do?
[23:45.22]Oh!
[23:45.54]Are we alright?
[23:46.10]It's stuck on me!
[23:46.98]Get it off me!
[23:47.80]Get it off me!
[23:48.54]Get it off me!
[23:48.96]It's stuck on me!
[23:50.06]Oh.
[23:50.46]No, it's alright.
[23:50.94]Is it open?
[23:51.60]Now it is.
[23:51.93]Alright, we're fine.
[23:58.36]Practice range.
[24:06.97]Cat puke.
[24:09.23]Where am I going?
[24:10.05]This way?
[24:10.35]Alright.
[24:29.99]Wait, why are there people here?
[24:32.85]Why do we have these guys just walking around?
[24:34.97]Oh, fuck!
[24:39.03]Why do we have humans?
[24:51.42]Guy in the back.
[24:52.24]Check this out.
[25:05.49]I want another grenade.
[25:10.37]Full?
[25:20.36]There we go, you gotta do it like sidearm.
[25:25.26]Yes!
[25:25.72]Alright, that's fun, cool.
[25:34.92]I'm really healthy now.
[25:41.56]Hypers.
[25:43.53]What is Hypers?
[25:49.81]Oh, I'm like, where am I?
[25:50.57]Yes, sir.
[26:03.86]23?
[26:04.06]Oh, shit.
[26:06.80]Um... I'm out of the car.
[26:07.98]Oh, shit.
[26:08.94]I fucked it up.
[26:23.08]The Nazis didn't bomb Abilene, Texas.
[26:24.76]They bombed London, England.
[26:26.90]They destroyed my home.
[26:29.08]They burned my entire life to the ground, and now I want to do the same thing to the Third Reich.
[26:35.18]Go ahead, turn me in.
[26:37.16]I'll find a way to get to the front.
[26:39.37]How do you think I got to Tunisia?
[26:42.19]Forging transfer orders has become an hobby of mine.
[26:45.89]I will make it to France.
[26:49.22]No, you're finally awake.
[26:50.86]Harry Potter.
[26:51.50]That's what I said.
[26:52.24]What does it say?
[26:52.80]I need the next part of the game to load in the right spot, so I'm going to go this way.
[27:01.18]Okay.
[27:18.60]Okay, I don't care.
[27:36.50]I'm trying... The game needs to load correctly when this cutscene's over.
[27:39.80]See, you know what I mean?
[27:41.74]I have to be standing in the right spot.
[27:48.54]I just gave that guy like a spine problem.
[27:52.24]Oh you mean this thing?
[28:06.63]I feel like one of the Muppets.
[28:07.37]That has like the real human hands, you know what I mean?
[28:09.15]They're always kind of like moving their fingers and stuff.
[28:33.08]It's like the Swedish chef.
[28:34.76]Where is he?
[28:38.08]That's Huxley over there?
[28:40.86]Oh, excellent.
[28:42.00]Good to know.
[28:44.15]Got it.
[28:51.75]Turn up the game audio?
[28:52.61]Really?
[28:52.85]It's still low?
[28:54.05]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:01.31]There you go.
[29:02.17]Now you're gonna be good.
[29:04.31]Now you're gonna be good.
[29:08.05]Hello, I'm Huxley, your quartermaster.
[29:11.20]No!
[29:11.68]I'm here to brief you on weapons, gear, and all the threats you face.
[29:15.62]I did this!
[29:16.44]We just did it!
[29:18.78]Why is every VR game a fucking tutorial for an hour?
[29:22.80]You just showed this to me!
[29:25.83]No!
[29:26.41]I just, you already know how to use the guns!
[29:28.43]Leave, please!
[29:29.65]How do I leave?
[29:32.05]I don't want to do another shooting range.
[29:33.83]Why does every VR game have to have a fucking firing range?
[29:37.31]What the?
[29:41.47]Oh, how do you use a grenade?
[29:42.62]I don't know.
[29:43.30]It's something like this.
[29:46.80]That was a perfect fucking CSGO flashbang.
[29:49.28]I would have gotten fucking tons of accolades from my teammates for that one.
[29:56.87]Just give me everything.
[29:57.70]Whatever.
[29:59.46]Am I wrong or is this like another firing range?
[30:01.42]Am I going crazy for no reason?
[30:06.30]Look, there's a gun.
[30:07.56]I know how to use the gun.
[30:11.42]Look, there's pistol ammo.
[30:12.31]This is what pistol ammo is.
[30:13.73]This is what SMG is.
[30:15.29]Okay, how do I leave?
[30:20.13]Live fire gauntlet.
[30:22.81]I'd like to continue the campaign.
[30:24.53]Goodbye.
[30:25.01]Thank you.
[30:25.46]It's been fun.
[30:27.50]But first, I need to see if I can grab this.
[30:29.48]Huxley.
[30:30.14]I can't.
[30:31.05]Who's that?
[30:32.23]The French resistance is made up of men and women from all walks of life.
[30:37.43]Every day, they are risking their lives to liberate their country.
[30:41.63]It's like a hitman level.
[30:46.19]The sergeant already told you how much he loves the M1 Garand.
[30:51.37]Everything he said... 47, you need to get the fuck out of the level.
[30:54.84]Actress, easy to...
[31:04.52]Whatever.
[31:08.50]Make contact with Manon Batiste and her French resistance.
[31:15.12]I'm ready.
[31:17.24]I get seasick on these things, guys.
[31:19.13]I'm sorry.
[31:19.73]Okay, I think I'll be stopped.
[31:25.53]Keep an eye on the lighthouse.
[31:26.99]We're supposed to look for a signal.
[31:28.45]That one?
[31:28.99]Yep.
[31:32.13]I missed it.
[31:33.73]Alright, we're ready.
[31:35.20]Alright, eliminate the enemy patrol investigating the explosion.
[31:45.12]Where?
[31:45.34]Oh, shit.
[31:45.58]Okay, go.
[32:07.08]I didn't have any time to do anything.
[32:08.22]What?
[32:08.46]They just said... What the fuck?
[32:11.22]This is a trap!
[32:13.18]This is a fucking trap!
[32:22.67]He actually fell for it.
[32:24.13]What is this?
[32:25.53]Is this a Vuvuzela?
[32:37.93]What is this?
[32:39.73]What is this?
[32:40.25]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[32:52.56]I'm gonna die.
[32:57.94]No, put that back on.
[32:58.86]Fucking idiot.
[33:06.26]My god that was awful He's not dead I had to kill him I have to kill him I
[33:43.03]How many more people are in this game?
[33:50.96]I think I did it.
[33:51.52]I want that shovel.
[33:55.36]Wait, what is this thing?
[34:17.05]Got it.
[34:17.59]Whew.
[34:17.77]Code book.
[34:18.08]You got it.
[34:18.54]That was fucking insane.
[34:19.32]I still don't understand.
[34:20.42]What is this?
[34:20.80]That's not a code book.
[34:21.72]What is that?
[34:47.06]Toothbrush.
[34:52.76]That was... pretty pog.
[34:57.54]Oh my... Dude, can I like, slash somebody?
[35:00.06]Found it!
[35:00.31]Found it.
[35:17.28]Sorry, do I have to burn this?
[35:23.32]Oh, am I getting extracted?
[35:27.99]Alright, well that wasn't so bad.
[35:33.33]How did he know you got it?
[35:34.49]It was a rocket launcher, but you fired the only shot accidentally.
[35:44.05]What about the carrots?
[35:46.49]You can't eat those carrots?
[36:12.36]The Third Reich is ruthless.
[36:14.74]But so is the French resistance.
[36:19.76]Sorry, I get sick.
[36:21.70]I grew up here.
[36:22.32]I'm going to do that one again.
[36:23.36]Remember that joke?
[36:24.66]We're moving around and stuff, especially out in the water, makes me sick.
[36:28.09]You don't remember that one?
[36:32.45]I'm doing it again.
[36:33.55]That's the boucherie.
[36:36.23]Where my brother worked.
[36:41.61]And here we are.
[36:42.27]Our secret base.
[36:44.79]Slap yourself.
[36:47.75]You can't.
[36:53.78]Secret base.
[36:54.92]Pretty cool.
[36:58.90]This is weird.
[37:01.36]I feel like that's the principal.
[37:03.93]That's my mom.
[37:04.87]That's my math teacher.
[37:05.93]That's my English teacher.
[37:06.99]And that's like the school bus driver.
[37:11.10]Like what did I do?
[37:12.09]I did something really bad.
[37:13.31]Am I getting like suspended?
[37:16.83]I can't smoke one of these.
[37:23.35]Come on, give me like toys to play with.
[37:39.99]Against my wishes, Juliet works inside, undercover as a clerk.
[37:44.23]Can you fucking believe this?
[37:45.19]She's seen a dramatic increase in radio transmissions and coded messages.
[37:50.16]No, I didn't want to skip the cutscene.
[37:51.70]I was going to do a thing where I pretend to be like a baby at the dinner table.
[37:55.18]Whatever.
[37:58.02]Capture Lewis.
[37:58.86]Lieutenant, this is a perfect spot.
[38:07.42]Alright.
[38:08.20]Eliminate the checkpoint guards.
[38:09.68]Where are they?
[38:11.36]I see them, right there.
[38:19.81]WHAT?!
[38:26.58]Are you fucking kidding me?! !
[38:39.43]I'm dead.
[38:41.96]Why did they not die?
[38:42.96]Lieutenant, this is a perfect spot for our ambush.
[38:46.94]But we need you to clear out the checkpoint first.
[38:54.40]What happened?
[38:55.82]I didn't pull the pin.
[38:56.67]I didn't pull the pin.
[38:57.49]Did I?
[38:59.27]When did I pull the pin?
[39:04.23]What happened?
[39:04.67]I didn't pull the pin.
[39:06.31]What happened?
[39:06.95]Look!
[39:07.89]I was just holding it in my hand.
[39:08.93]Did the pin come out?
[39:10.33]No, it didn't.
[39:13.34]What the fuck is happening, dude?
[39:18.06]I'm confused as hell.
[39:19.06]I have no idea what's going on.
[39:21.64]I ate it!
[39:23.62]Okay.
[39:25.49]That's so stupid.
[39:26.85]Alright, let's go.
[39:28.17]Give me the fucking rifle.
[39:30.01]No, I want the rifle.
[39:35.95]Where are they?
[39:42.91]I'm looking the complete wrong way.
[39:56.90]Hide behind this thing!
[39:57.64]Oh fuck, this rock is gonna save my life!
[40:09.62]I can't believe I'm still alive.
[40:35.31]Oh shit!
[40:38.03]Where is he?
[40:38.41]Where's the guy?
[40:38.87]Oh my God, get behind the rock.
[40:54.68]That it?
[40:56.75]Alright.
[40:58.13]Whew.
[40:59.23]That was fucking crazy.
[41:05.15]What was going on in those pictures?
[41:08.48]I'll explain it when you're older.
[41:11.40]What we got?
[41:13.20]What's the damage?
[41:13.84]Hold on.
[41:16.81]What happened?
[41:21.03]I don't want to just... That guy's got dynamite!
[41:22.53]Hey!
[41:22.67]Put that down.
[41:23.29]Wait, he can do that.
[41:24.73]I can do that too.
[41:25.63]Boom.
[41:38.76]Yeah, so they brought along a one-to-one full model of this whole mission.
[41:44.58]Why did they bring it here?
[41:47.67]That's me!
[41:48.19]I would like the dynamite to be... Hmm.
[41:49.19]Hmm.
[41:49.27]Hmm.
[42:09.18]I would like the dynamite to be... I'm gonna go ahead and say... Right, uh... I would like the dynamite to be right... Oh, here.
[42:36.26]Uh-huh.
[42:38.56]Excellent choice.
[42:40.00]Catch them right when they come out, right, Bill?
[42:41.87]Marcel?
[42:43.67]And now our people.
[42:45.21]Shaky hands.
[42:49.15]Where should we be placed?
[42:51.91]Well, I think to be able to make sure we get the most out of this explosion, I think Ollie should be probably somewhere in this vicinity right here.
[43:00.01]what I mean right right over there uh ollie I think you should be right next to the explosives I think that's the perfect view of the uh the convoy coming out of there yeah it's coming out of there I'll back you up juliet uh perfect example we also need you to be able to pack up ollie so if ollie's gonna be there I need you here right next to that yep if you could go over there that'd be perfect and uh sarge
[43:25.92]You're gonna need to back up Juliette, because she's gonna be focusing on backing up Ollie.
[43:30.30]I would assume you'd have to be probably right over here, right up next to that, so we can make sure we get that good to go.
[43:35.23]And you!
[43:36.93]And finally.
[43:39.45]Where do you want me?
[43:43.47]Same place.
[43:45.65]Good work.
[43:47.60]The convoy will be here soon.
[43:49.20]I can see everything from up there.
[43:50.60]I can see everything?
[43:51.98]No, I... Good luck.
[43:54.32]Alright, good luck.
[43:56.61]I can see everything from up there.
[43:59.11]Do I- I'm gonna have, like, a cartoon detonator.
[44:04.27]Wait, where are they?
[44:06.27]Don't fire until they- wait.
[44:08.44]No, that's not what I- where- wait, wait, where are they?
[44:10.08]Where are they?
[44:10.88]Where are my teammates?
[44:16.76]Oh, they're- is that them?
[44:18.46]Oh, that's them right there.
[44:20.76]Out of my det-
[44:33.51]Got it!
[44:40.47]Why can't I kill that guy?
[44:45.13]What the fuck is going on?
[44:45.97]I don't know where it went!
[44:55.94]I don't know where it went!
[44:56.56]I don't know where it went!
[44:57.70]I don't know where it is!
[45:06.89]What was going on with the guy in the car?
[45:09.19]Oh, wait.
[45:10.13]I'm supposed to be protecting that guy.
[45:15.36]Oh, time for the anime thing.
[45:18.50]It's... Sorry about that.
[45:21.06]Somebody might have been shooting at you.
[45:24.54]English, please?
[45:25.42]Yes, I feel like we're missing some interesting discourse here.
[45:28.93]Why haven't you reported in?
[45:30.63]It's been two weeks.
[45:31.59]Yeah.
[45:32.19]They know there's a spy.
[45:34.59]Be careful.
[45:35.82]You poor baby.
[45:37.92]What are the Nazis up to?
[45:41.81]Feast a pute.
[45:43.51]I have zero patience right now, Louis.
[45:45.75]If you think that I'm treating you bad, imagine when we tell the Gestapo all about your nocturnal activities.
[45:53.30]That's right.
[45:54.02]Remember, I have pictures.
[46:00.43]Say something!
[46:01.87]There's a list.
[46:03.71]A list?
[46:04.93]Of all the Resistance members, there's no Manzi.
[46:07.51]The Gestapo's been compiling it for months.
[46:09.83]They are bringing in a trainload of special troops to round everyone up.
[46:14.60]I do not know.
[46:15.56]I am not privy to... Goodbye!
[46:18.68]Five o'clock.
[46:19.92]Open your tool kit!
[46:21.04]Get out of here!
[46:23.10]Marcel.
[46:24.74]Oui, mademoiselle.
[46:28.51]We need to blow up a train.
[46:31.07]I don't see.
[46:33.56]What are you signaling?
[46:40.81]You're wasting ammo?
[46:42.63]Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[46:45.57]Train sabotage.
[46:46.67]This is fun.
[46:48.76]Blow up the Nazi train.
[46:49.76]You got it.
[46:55.82]You can't kill anybody.
[46:56.76]Like, nobody can die.
[46:58.02]Watch.
[46:58.28]I mean, it looked like he got rocked, but... That's stupid.
[47:19.21]I don't think he's a human.
[47:20.59]You got it.
[47:20.95]Whatever you say.
[47:22.13]Punch him in the stomach?
[47:23.65]Good idea!
[47:53.32]Oh, never mind, I can't.
[47:57.08]Alright, take cover.
[47:58.48]No, I want them to see me Fortnite dancing before they die.
[48:07.14]Come on, they need to see this before they go!
[48:21.03]Oh my god, that was epic!
[48:33.69]Nazis!
[48:39.88]Oh, fuck.
[48:46.68]Got him.
[48:46.98]Dang.
[48:47.26]Nope, that's a good guy.
[48:59.67]Where are they?
[49:06.05]That guy didn't even get shot and he died.
[49:28.70]I can't do it with the other hand, I don't care.
[50:00.23]Clear!
[50:15.60]How does this shoot?
[50:25.92]Oh.
[50:27.06]How do I... Alright, whatever.
[50:29.80]I got it.
[50:36.22]Anybody else in the train?
[50:43.49]Anybody in this train?
[50:45.41]Surrender.
[50:48.25]Surrender.
[50:59.03]Whoa.
[51:01.77]Plans.
[51:04.32]Secret plans.
[51:07.39]What?
[51:11.91]No, I want that glass.
[51:15.06]I don't want this.
[51:17.86]What the fuck is this?
[51:23.32]I'm just a guy from Trailer Park, boys.
[51:25.96]Oh, fuck.
[51:26.40]What's going on in here, man?
[51:27.80]Ricky, we gotta be careful.
[51:29.02]Oh, wow.
[51:30.54]God damn it.
[51:31.94]I don't have any... I blew up.
[51:53.08]What just blew me up?
[51:54.96]What happened?
[51:58.83]Shit.
[51:59.39]Okay, I'm not fucking... Let's go.
[52:05.37]What the fuck?
[52:06.23]Are you kidding me, dude?
[52:07.87]Are you kidding me?
[52:14.87]I need items.
[52:15.71]Alright, come on.
[52:16.23]I'm not... No more fucking around.
[52:17.35]Let's go.
[52:32.15]I was like, Morty, fuck.
[52:34.21]I didn't mean to do Morty, I swear to God, I promise.
[52:43.28]No, stupid idiot.
[53:00.44]What are you... Go, go, go, go, go, come on, come on.
[53:09.36]Brick.
[53:09.66]What has happened?
[53:13.83]What happened to my computer?
[53:25.13]What happened to my computer?
[53:29.58]Are we still live?
[53:31.20]What's wrong with my computer?
[53:40.40]We can't see your screen?
[53:42.15]Yes you can, don't lie.
[53:58.35]Head.
[53:58.79]I was in the head.
[54:10.21]Got it!
[54:10.41]Alright, I need to take this.
[54:16.04]I don't want to shoot it because... Oh god.
[54:19.14]I gotta shoot the tank.
[54:22.77]Plans!
[54:31.87]That was cool.
[54:32.27]Alright, where's my, uh, where's my, uh, where's my, uh... Where's the tank?
[54:46.57]That scout tank is back.
[54:48.01]Alright, where's it?
[54:53.18]Where's the tank?
[54:56.58]Lieutenant, follow the number one rule I gave
[55:01.21]Where's the tank?
[55:01.85]Where is it?
[55:02.53]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[55:06.03]Where is it?
[55:07.81]What's happening?
[55:08.95]Where's the tank?
[55:09.49]Where is it?
[55:30.66]Oh shit!
[55:31.44]Oh my god!
[55:32.72]Oh my god!
[55:34.78]Oh my god!
[55:40.32]Where the... Where's this fucking tank?
[55:50.47]Am I insane?
[55:51.43]Where is it?
[55:53.05]Where's the tank?
[55:54.37]Where's the tank?
[55:57.49]What the fuck just happened?
[55:59.93]Why am I... I just pulled the audio out.
[56:09.81]Can you hear it?
[56:15.54]No, you idiot!
[56:24.36]Give me a gun!
[56:34.37]It's right there!
[56:34.85]I see it!
[56:42.35]Eat shit!
[56:43.19]I couldn't do it!
[56:47.25]I was trying to do the movie!
[56:51.30]Fuck!
[56:56.68]Where's my gun?
[56:57.36]Okay, good.
[57:01.64]Right here!
[57:13.85]Alright.
[57:15.87]Holy shit.
[57:17.59]That was crazy.
[57:26.15]Hold on, I gotta come back this way.
[57:30.21]I gotta come back this way.
[57:35.00]Nice work, Marcel.
[57:36.62]Merci beaucoup.
[57:39.54]This gentleman appears to be the highest ranking jermaOn the train.
[57:45.02]Not good.
[57:46.95]This is one of Rudolf Mueller's men.
[57:48.25]My pants fall down.
[57:49.07]Mueller is the director of special projects for the Jerma I command.
[57:55.19]He's involved.
[57:55.77]It's not good for anyone.
[57:57.83]He's not good.
[57:59.89]What's it say?
[58:00.83]I'm sweaty.
[58:01.61]Well, lots of words in Jerma.
[58:05.35]Jerma?
[58:05.73]I thought you said, hey Jerma.
[58:07.61]Pay attention Jerma in the cutscene.
[58:08.83]What are you fucking dumb?
[58:09.62]Missed the raid?
[58:10.32]Somebody, who raided?
[58:12.88]Who was, there was a raid?
[58:13.72]What was the raid?
[58:14.42]RT?
[58:14.50]What's up RT?
[58:15.58]Thanks for the raid RT.
[58:16.36]Welcome everybody.
[58:38.67]Blaine's in VR.
[58:39.96]For a little bit.
[58:42.38]I've become fully vaccinated today, so I want to take it easy.
[58:45.68]I say that as I scream and shoot missiles and stuff.
[58:48.40]You have a piece of cake on you.
[58:50.14]Whatever.
[59:01.00]I know.
[59:02.38]Frontal assault on Gestapo headquarters is a much different proposition than ambushing a convoy or blowing up a train.
[59:09.02]We can't do it alone.
[59:11.05]C'est vrai.
[59:12.03]It's true.
[59:13.37]We need more resistance members, but that's much easier said than done.
[59:19.59]I know who we could get!
[59:21.25]No, I'm the crazy one.
[59:22.47]What the fuck?
[59:22.79]No, it's me.
[59:23.05]I'm the one that's like the crazy one.
[59:24.49]No, no, no.
[59:25.11]I don't want those guys.
[59:26.63]I'm the fun one.
[59:27.51]I'm the crazy guy for this one.
[59:29.73]Okay.
[59:51.13]I need to... Wait, let me get some... Let me get a... Hold on, not yet.
[59:56.58]The Vino brothers.
[59:57.56]Make contact with the Vino brothers.
[59:58.70]Prove you're on their side.
[59:59.92]Hold on.
[60:00.08]How do we know?
[60:00.54]They're not that bad.
[60:25.48]I wonder if they're home Oh put cap Hello Vincent
[60:50.21]I was getting better view.
[60:52.75]I was getting... I was standing behind everybody.
[60:54.79]What the fuck?
[60:56.33]I was... Dropping it.
[60:58.19]Okay, I was wanting to get a better view.
[61:00.72]I'm the character that wants to... They don't have cameras on their heads.
[61:03.40]I do.
[61:03.70]I want to get a good view.
[61:07.02]What?
[61:07.16]What?
[61:14.54]I didn't grip... It's because I hit the... I touched the... Look.
[61:18.46]I touched the grip button.
[61:20.18]I touched the... I'm not doing this on purpose.
[61:24.80]I swear to God.
[61:25.74]Drop your weapons.
[61:27.14]Put your hands up.
[61:27.90]Make any move and we shoot.
[61:29.60]I... I touched the grip on the index controller and he pulled the gun out.
[61:35.86]Hello Vincent.
[61:40.49]You have a lot of nerve trespassing on someone else's property.
[61:43.75]I recognize you and your sister, but who is that with you?
[61:48.09]Our friend is with the OHS.
[61:49.77]They've come to help the resistance.
[61:51.79]Hey, oh, we are just simple winemakers.
[61:55.36]We know nothing of this, uh, resistance.
[61:59.14]How do we know you're not all just the Gestapo's guys coming here to arrest us on false charges?
[62:03.70]We don't have time for games.
[62:05.54]We need your help.
[62:06.66]The real Gestapo is about to round up every resistance cell in Normandy.
[62:11.53]Can I put my hands down?
[62:12.19]Heal him.
[62:13.41]Shoot him.
[62:13.67]What?
[62:13.77]Oh, not them.
[62:14.03]Hide for the ambush.
[62:14.63]Remember, you forgot to wear tighter pants.
[62:39.53]Hey, can I have this?
[62:41.55]Stay hidden.
[62:42.03]I'm not inside!
[62:42.89]Fuck you!
[63:12.64]Hey!
[63:13.36]Sugar and cream with your coffee, motherfucker!
[63:31.29]No!
[63:31.81]No, no!
[63:32.59]Don't be a child!
[63:43.78]Don't shoot.
[63:44.68]Intense adjournment.
[63:45.56]Stop their truck.
[63:46.68]Hey.
[63:47.04]Alright.
[64:12.60]You're hitting the wall.
[64:13.62]You're hitting the wall.
[64:14.24]I just want to make sure you know that.
[64:15.16]You're hitting the wall.
[64:17.75]Two steps to your left.
[64:20.05]Are they even here yet, or are you a bad guy?
[64:21.87]What's going on?
[64:22.35]Nazis!
[64:24.33]Alright.
[64:35.36]Cover me.
[64:36.88]One, two, three.
[64:38.04]We go together.
[64:38.51]Ready?
[64:38.83]One, two...
[64:41.45]One, two, three, go!
[64:57.08]We good?
[64:59.12]Oh my God, get out of the way!
[65:03.95]I can't pick up the huge rock?
[65:04.85]That's annoying.
[65:05.67]I only have three bullets?
[65:25.21]Cover me!
[65:58.73]Do something!
[66:05.73]Wait, my underwear's falling down!
[66:07.10]My underwear's showing!
[66:07.94]My underwear!
[66:09.36]You guys can't see them, good thing I'm... My underwear's out.
[66:13.34]Good thing I'm not standing up.
[66:34.47]Where is he?
[66:46.48]Where is he?
[66:50.52]Where are they?
[66:51.98]Alright.
[66:53.18]This thing sucks!
[67:14.99]Is that it?
[67:23.90]One more, I think.
[67:24.68]Over here.
[67:33.86]Oh my God, there's a lot.
[67:34.84]Get in the bathtub.
[67:38.72]Oh, fuck.
[67:39.52]Oh, fuck.
[67:39.90]Oh, fuck.
[67:40.26]Oh, fuck.
[67:40.51]Don't lose here.
[67:47.25]That was nuts.
[67:50.53]Okay.
[67:51.77]We believe you.
[67:52.98]We need to join forces and raid Gestapo headquarters.
[67:55.88]Alright.
[67:56.26]Thanks for the raid.
[67:56.84]Gestapo headquarters.
[67:57.78]We'll do it.
[68:00.34]But we need more than just people.
[68:02.26]We need weapons and supplies.
[68:04.40]The Germans are fortifying... What's wrong with this guy?
[68:06.17]Is he okay?
[68:06.67]Maybe we could steal what we need from there.
[68:08.93]And how do you suggest we do that?
[68:10.81]Maybe you could use some of these uniforms.
[68:12.83]Ban that guy.
[68:13.35]And take that truck.
[68:15.51]You could just drive right in.
[68:17.73]This is the best plan ever!
[68:31.34]Play something else?
[68:33.40]I'll give this another mission.
[68:34.90]We'll move on to something else after.
[68:42.15]I'm having fun with this one.
[68:43.99]I need to turn though.
[68:45.71]Which way do I need to turn?
[68:46.59]I think this way.
[68:49.22]Is that accurate?
[68:51.01]It is.
[68:51.25]Alright, let me just keep going.
[68:54.27]We have to steal weapons from the Nazis.
[68:57.77]Okay.
[69:02.95]I'm so fucking sweaty, it's unbelievable.
[69:08.50]Drive more like a Jerma.
[69:10.08]What does that mean?
[69:11.18]You're all over the road.
[69:12.62]Be more precise.
[69:13.75]For the love of God, will you stop waving at them?
[69:17.01]I'm just being friendly.
[69:18.03]We're... We are not coming to do anything weird.
[69:20.91]Hello!
[69:21.37]Hello!
[69:22.37]Hello!
[69:22.97]You're looking quite Aryan today.
[69:25.03]Hello!
[69:26.13]When we get caught, my only request is that they shoot you first.
[69:36.25]He's so high.
[69:41.45]We're not coming to steal anything from you!
[69:45.29]How do I... I wish I could get the finger.
[69:50.41]I wanna get the finger so bad.
[70:01.23]Wow.
[70:03.47]Wow.
[70:15.63]Can I skip the cutscene?
[70:18.01]Sneak into the outpost.
[70:24.39]Okay, are you trying to get me to throw up?
[70:32.01]What?
[70:34.77]I got out of the car!
[70:37.27]Grab some crates and load them into the truck.
[70:47.19]Alright.
[70:50.74]Did they say he is not Jerma?
[70:57.08]Just fill it up the back!
[71:24.74]You boys have a wonderful day!
[71:26.44]Have a wonderful evening!
[71:28.16]By the way, we weren't really Nazis!
[71:31.40]Why?
[71:31.64]How are we not instantly dead?
[72:00.04]Come on!
[72:07.32]Catch that!
[72:11.38]Oh my god, I don't know where it is!
[72:16.16]I'm alright.
[72:24.32]What just happened?
[72:29.73]Um, I... Okay, good, good, good, we're good, we're good.
[72:40.21]This is too much happening.
[72:41.94]It's too much happening at the same time.
[72:48.16]We good?
[72:48.48]Give me a gun.
[73:01.02]I thought that was a person, oh shit.
[73:16.71]I'm gonna throw up.
[73:17.65]Alright, I gotta... Just run him over, run him over, who cares.
[73:25.75]Good job.
[73:35.91]Am I shooting the guy in the head that's next to me?
[73:41.88]Good driving.
[73:46.66]What just hurt me?
[73:51.62]Duck noise?
[73:52.58]What?
[73:57.19]Belle de coin.
[74:00.31]Whatever.
[74:05.88]That's way more boxes than we put in here.
[74:09.12]Don't hit her.
[74:11.28]We brought weapons.
[74:35.17]Next game?
[74:36.46]Yeah, we can move on.
[74:37.86]This was fun, though.
[74:38.40]I had a lot of fun.
[74:38.90]Let's just see what's next.
[74:40.08]Skip.
[74:40.38]Let's just skip.
[74:43.86]Whatever.
[74:44.12]I gotta find the bomb?
[74:44.68]I'll find that bomb.
[74:46.00]Don't you worry.
[75:06.93]One of these is a bomb?
[75:09.91]How about the statue of Benjamin Franklin?
[75:14.47]Whoops.
[75:21.64]Alright, I'm... It's upstairs?
[75:23.14]Alright, there's a bomb upstairs.
[75:27.06]I'm gonna get it.
[75:31.72]Find the bomb!
[75:37.78]Nope.
[75:40.04]Nope.
[75:49.22]I even wanted that.
[75:51.60]Bomb.
[75:52.00]If I was a bomb.
[75:59.97]Bomb behind the bookshelf.
[76:03.03]Um...
[76:08.26]In the piano!
[76:22.88]This is fun!
[76:29.94]Onto the bed!
[76:31.78]Find the cupboard key?
[76:35.59]Oh god, I- where the fuck would I-
[76:44.31]Can I open anything?
[76:45.07]Can I touch anything?
[76:48.63]Cupboard key.
[76:51.89]That was- that was fun.
[76:56.01]Cupboard key!
[77:02.17]Where is it?
[77:03.89]Is it the rubber book?
[77:09.68]What did that- what just exploded?
[77:17.17]Uh... Nothing?
[77:21.65]No books?
[77:22.15]Nothing in here?
[77:26.11]Uh... Key.
[77:26.65]Where is it?
[77:34.88]Jesus!
[77:38.10]No key.
[77:38.52]Where's the key?
[77:45.08]What?
[77:48.75]It was right there.
[77:49.85]Bimbo.
[77:55.72]Jerma loves the what?
[77:57.88]Why does he look so short?
[77:59.04]I've explained it already.
[77:59.94]I'm not going to explain it again.
[78:05.88]Alright.
[78:06.92]I think I'm going to take a break.
[78:07.72]I'm going to switch games.
[78:09.53]I liked this one though.
[78:10.41]This one was actually pretty fun.
[78:13.25]I want to get some water.
[78:13.93]I want to stretch a little bit.
[78:28.92]Does anyone know where it is?
[78:32.16]It's time for Rick and Morty.
[78:33.22]It's not time for Rick and Morty.
[78:37.69]Does anyone know where it is?
[78:39.13]It's in a book.
[78:49.47]There's no water in here.
[78:58.65]Key!
[78:59.07]There's diamonds in here and shit.
[79:00.13]Whatever.
[79:06.09]What the hell?
[79:06.45]I can't use any of this.
[79:10.81]There are giant holes in the wall?
[79:16.53]Yeah, but I don't know where the... I need to find a key in here.
[79:30.03]In a book?
[79:42.89]This book?
[79:47.81]Hey!
[79:53.46]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[79:56.77]I just caught it.
[79:58.53]Alright.
[79:59.48]New game.
[79:59.90]New game.
[80:00.26]I'm out of here.
[80:00.64]I'm out.
[80:00.86]I'm out.
[80:01.26]New game.
[80:01.64]New game.
[80:02.04]New, new, new, new, new, new.
[80:02.90]Whatever.
[80:10.93]Okay.
[80:11.93]New game.
[80:13.59]Where should we go?
[80:16.45]We got... Hmm...
[80:22.61]There's a lot of stuff to potentially play.
[80:24.33]I got so many games.
[80:25.59]You have no idea.
[80:26.95]We're not going to be able to do even a quarter of these.
[80:29.69]But it's good to have them.
[80:33.42]I can't see you guys anymore.
[80:36.20]Um... Is Hell Split Arena any good?
[80:44.24]Should I play?
[80:44.76]Okay.
[80:45.86]Is Hell Split Arena any good?
[80:50.52]I'm not playing SCP, no way.
[80:52.28]Not right now.
[80:55.15]I am in far too much physical discomfort to cringe that hard and scream and shit like that.
[81:00.81]I've already done it like two or three times already.
[81:03.39]I can't do that.
[81:04.27]Not right now.
[81:04.95]Maybe on Halloween.
[81:06.45]Why did I buy it?
[81:07.09]Because I bought like a bunch of scary games for VR Halloween this year.
[81:15.34]Play Rick and Morty.
[81:19.50]Play the executioner game.
[81:22.30]Yeah, how long have I been streaming for?
[81:23.92]Was it like an hour or two?
[81:26.14]Oh, shit.
[81:26.42]I've been playing for like an hour and a half.
[81:28.99]Alright, well, I'm going to do... Alright, how many people are here?
[81:35.53]There are 13,000 people here.
[81:37.23]I want everyone to pay attention.
[81:39.47]Because if that number goes down by a significant amount, you know what happened.
[81:44.13]There are 13,000 people here.
[81:47.17]I'm going to play Rick and Morty.
[81:50.25]As much as I don't want to, but I'm going to.
[81:52.62]I already did this.
[81:53.60]Alright.
[81:54.28]We're playing for like 10 minutes.
[82:01.06]We're going to play Rick and Morty for literally 10 minutes.
[82:03.96]But I got to take a break first.
[82:05.64]So give me a sec.
[82:06.84]I'll be right back.
[82:09.17]Give me one minute.
[82:10.13]I'm going to take a break.
[82:11.27]I haven't come out of the headset in like an hour and a half.
[82:15.45]Hello.
[82:19.17]Alright.
[82:20.97]Give me two seconds.
[82:21.95]I'm gonna go pee, grab some more water.
[82:23.54]Be right back.
[86:35.54]okay I'm back I am back so when I came out of the headset I'm definitely starting to feel a little slower I think okay those of you that have had the vaccine uh I am am I like freaking myself out or am I like oh here it comes here it comes here it comes here it comes
[87:04.48]Where's this?
[87:04.82]I know they're coming.
[87:06.06]When are the side effects coming?
[87:07.01]I know that.
[87:07.45]Where are they?
[87:09.59]I don't know.
[87:10.45]I might just be like amping myself up for no reason.
[87:18.88]Just stay active.
[87:22.88]Well, I feel alright.
[87:29.04]So we might be on borrow time here right now.
[87:33.16]So let's just keep going.
[87:34.98]Because if I start to feel kind of like shit, then I'm going to have to leave.
[87:37.98]So let's just go.
[87:41.96]Let's do it.
[87:43.58]Time for Rick and Morty.
[87:45.22]Virtual Rickality.
[87:46.66]Why am I even doing this?
[87:52.74]Hello.
[87:54.20]I have returned.
[87:57.48]Can you guys hear the game?
[88:03.35]And I need these.
[88:05.73]Oh my God, this is the couch.
[88:22.60]No way.
[88:28.78]Where's Rick?
[88:33.68]Rick and Morty Volume 1.
[88:34.90]No.
[88:37.52]I want the best season.
[88:38.73]Season 2 is the best season for sure.
[88:40.45]Holy shit.
[88:46.63]It's The Simpsons couch.
[88:48.03]Hold on.
[88:49.81]Let me pull my pants up.
[88:51.15]I need to insert a disc.
[88:52.69]How do I open this?
[88:53.27]Oh.
[88:54.63]We already did that.
[88:55.33]Whatever.

[89:50.45]Yeah, I know.
[89:50.95]I had to rearrange the entire garage to do it, Morty.
[89:55.09]Morty clone pay attention to me.
[89:57.20]I need you to take this laundry and put it in the washing machine And if that's too confusing of instructions for you, you know There's a dry erase board on the that I put up in the garage here the dry erase board area You'll see I wrote instructions on what you're supposed to do
[90:27.15]We're going to play the Executioner game.
[90:31.83]I'm not doing that again.
[90:32.91]I'm not doing it again.
[90:36.71]Since there's an experience that lasts around an hour and is designed to be played in one sitting, progress is saved automatically.
[90:41.33]The consequences of your actions are permanent.
[90:43.23]This contains graphic violence.
[90:46.12]The events depicted are based in historical law and punishment from 16th century Europe as such.
[90:49.90]It contains depictions of crimes which some may find disturbing or triggering.
[90:56.05]Wait, what?
[90:56.75]Oh, I just missed everything.
[90:58.95]Wait, what is happening?
[91:03.96]Press to pause.
[91:04.88]Press and hold, then release to teleport.
[91:06.86]Okay, I think the other one was this.
[91:10.52]Left to right.
[91:11.56]Touch left and right to turn.
[91:12.90]I don't know what just happened.
[91:16.04]Touch left and right to turn.
[91:17.44]I think I'm just going to have to turn like this.
[91:19.59]It's kind of loud, too.
[91:26.60]Okay, so... What the fuck?
[91:33.14]Okay, squeeze and hold to pick up objects.
[91:36.98]So yeah, it's just like a grip.
[91:38.04]Okay.
[91:40.12]Press and hold, then release to teleport.
[91:42.00]Press to pause.
[91:44.74]This is pick up objects.
[91:50.18]Can I pick up gloves?
[91:52.08]Oh, so what color gloves do I want?
[91:53.58]Green?
[91:53.96]Alright, I'll take green.
[92:01.08]Oh Jesus.
[92:04.03]Welcome, Executioner.
[92:06.31]I see you've arrived safe and sound.
[92:08.61]I have.
[92:09.11]As expected.
[92:10.55]Law and order thrive here, as you'll soon witness firsthand.
[92:15.17]Although the name Executioner is hated by many and perceived as an inhuman, bloody, and tyrannical office, in truth, one does not sin if they act on orders out of justice as God's servant.
[92:34.11]On the scaffold, our foremost concern is to deliver a good death for our poor sinner.
[92:41.91]We are not butchers.
[92:43.89]Public execution is a divine theater of justice and redemption.
[92:50.02]A carefully orchestrated drama designed to inspire goodness as well as impress our authority.
[92:58.25]I will announce the crime and the sentence.
[93:01.50]Then, the poor sinner will have an opportunity to speak their last words.
[93:06.84]My right ear is on fire.
[93:08.04]I shall then declare, may God have mercy upon your soul.
[93:11.74]Is this Justin Roiland?
[93:13.00]And you shall strike the neck from behind, chopping off the head with a single, graceful blow.
[93:21.19]Now that by taking this position... Whoa.
[93:26.61]Excellent.
[93:28.74]Wait, I didn't sign- Wait, I gotta read this!
[93:30.50]Upon take- I didn't even write my name!
[93:33.41]Upon taking the- Excuse- This is not- This doesn't hold up in- Oh my god.
[93:37.37]Oh my god.
[93:37.63]Oh my god.
[93:37.89]I can't play this.
[93:38.53]I'm gonna throw up.
[93:40.87]Holy shit, that was awful.
[93:44.07]Oh my god, that was awful.
[93:50.10]Alright, what- Good citizens of Ulrichshafen.
[93:54.86]this morning we gather to witness to be or not to be of this poor whether it is no blood in the mind he roamed the countryside attacking isolated farmsteads by night
[94:16.74]The family Stiglitzen.
[94:19.12]The family Meischner.
[94:20.72]What's wrong with me?
[94:21.48]Krauss, Arichler, Merkel, and more.
[94:26.78]He, along with three companions, bowed, tortured, and did violence to innocent people, robbing them of money, clothes, and forcing himself upon women and girls.
[94:40.92]This ain't good enough for him!
[94:42.68]These crimes being against the law of the land, my lords have decreed and given sentence that this man shall be condemned from life to death by the sword.
[94:56.01]That's my job.
[94:57.57]Do you have any final words?
[95:00.85]Albedo, you're too kind.
[95:04.09]What a fine introduction you've given me.
[95:06.35]Although, I'm afraid my performance is...
[95:11.18]Oh shit!
[95:14.92]Is he talking?
[95:16.74]Is he talking?
[95:18.32]How is he still talking?
[95:19.74]Oh my god!
[95:27.83]He fucking died!
[95:28.49]No, I fucking missed it!
[95:43.15]He fucking died behind the couch!
[95:46.67]He fucking... I fucking missed it!
[95:58.85]I didn't think that was even the same guy!
[96:00.55]I didn't think that was the same guy!
[96:02.51]Oh my god... Hold on, I need to know...
[96:14.45]Oh my god.
[96:19.49]That was insane.
[96:20.41]Why did he die?
[96:21.66]I have to see if that actually happens because that's fucking hilarious.
[96:27.02]If I kill him and then he gets mad at me behind the desk and then he puts his head fall off?
[96:40.13]Okay.
[96:41.37]players who obeyed, players who rebelled, players who have resigned, players who were fired?
[96:48.50]Wait a minute.
[96:50.14]Main menu.
[96:52.66]Um, give me this.
[96:54.16]I, I, we need to know.
[96:56.02]I have to know.
[96:59.58]Just sign it.
[97:00.06]Welcome, executioner.
[97:02.29]I see you've arrived.
[97:03.75]Oh, shit!
[97:04.49]My hand!
[97:05.03]My hand!
[97:06.37]Law and order thrive here.
[97:08.59]As you'll see.
[97:09.48]Okay, give me the sword.
[97:10.64]I need to know.
[97:11.14]This is important.
[97:12.48]Excellent.
[97:13.56]I look forward to working with you.
[97:21.61]I'm looking over here by the fire that is here.
[97:32.65]Okay, I'm gonna get a good view.
[97:35.38]I'm gonna get a good view of this because I just took his head off.
[97:38.50]You executed the prisoner before I'd given you permission.
[97:43.20]By doing this, not only do you undermine my authority, but the authority of our Lords.
[97:51.96]He's alive!
[97:53.54]And giving the poor sinner a chance to make their place before God.
[97:58.06]We show that not only are we in control, but that we are fair and just.
[98:05.97]This job is not simply the chopping of heads.
[98:10.03]It is a performance designed to send a message.
[98:14.01]Keep him down there.
[98:14.89]Keep him down.
[98:16.45]He will not be paid for today.
[98:21.51]Get the fuck away from me!
[98:23.34]Get him away from me!
[98:25.20]Get him away from me!
[98:26.70]Get him away from me!
[98:27.68]I killed him!
[98:28.52]I killed him!
[98:31.28]That's impossible!
[98:33.22]How many times do I have to kill him?
[98:36.44]Does it need to wipe the blade?
[98:37.68]I don't even... I can't even... This is cool.
[98:53.54]Kill him first.
[98:54.99]You should just go up and just slice his head immediately, just run over there and do it.
[99:12.54]Holding the sword the wrong way?
[99:37.83]I so badly- I wish I- One of the most regrets I've had in my whole life is laughing over here and not seeing his head fall off behind the desk.
[99:59.71]I, like, wish I could rewind it and do it again.
[100:02.15]But I broke it?
[100:02.99]Do it after he says his last words.
[100:05.07]Okay.
[100:05.47]What do you mean?
[100:07.81]Who?
[100:29.60]Where am I?
[100:35.77]Did I already die?
[100:36.53]It's right after he says his... Say your last words.
[100:47.88]I killed... I gotta do everything the same exact way, right?
[100:50.44]I'm sorry, we're doing this.
[100:51.74]Welcome, executioner.
[100:53.14]He says his little last words, I kill him, then I kill him.
[100:56.88]As expected.
[100:59.20]That's how it happened last time.
[101:02.15]Excellent.
[101:03.23]I look forward to working with you.
[101:04.95]Okay, so yeah, he says his crime.
[101:08.35]He's like, oh, fuck you, mate.
[101:10.39]And then I cut his head off.
[101:12.32]And then I walked over to him and I cut his head off.
[101:13.72]I gotta get this right.
[101:14.50]Okay.
[101:18.72]Oh, with the Tisnobla in the mind.
[101:20.38]Right, I threw that.
[101:22.24]Cool.
[101:23.12]I took a sip out of this.
[101:23.98]Okay.
[101:24.26]Okay.
[101:24.38]Yep.
[101:24.46]This is... I was over here.
[101:25.23]I walked this way.
[101:51.23]the family, Meissner, Krauss, Arichler, Merkel, and more.
[101:58.93]Stop her in handy.
[101:59.97]With three companions, bound, tortured, and did violence to innocent people, robbing them of money, clothes, and forcing himself upon women and girls.
[102:13.04]That ain't good enough for him!
[102:14.78]These crimes, being against the law of the land, my lords have decreed and given sentence that this man shall be condemned from life to death.
[102:26.52]He starts talking.
[102:27.26]Then I... I gotta get this right.
[102:29.66]Do you have any final words?
[102:32.96]Albedo, you're too calm.
[102:35.59]What a fine introduction you've given me.
[102:38.83]Although, I'm afraid...
[102:44.18]Okay, okay.
[102:46.76]Okay, here we go.
[102:48.74]We got it.
[102:54.98]We got it.
[102:55.32]We got it.
[102:57.56]We got it.
[103:07.24]You executed the prisoner before I'd given you permission.
[103:11.94]By doing this, not only do you undermine my authority, but the authority of our laws.
[103:19.99]By following the correct procedure and giving the poor sinners a chance to make their peace before God, we show that not only are we in control,
[103:30.87]Shit!
[103:30.97]It's alright, whatever.
[103:31.52]Why are the colors all off?
[103:33.50]Um, I don't... Alright, let me get- I'm gonna get it right.
[104:06.79]I'm trying to draw a smiley face.
[104:15.28]I can't believe it.
[104:18.02]Oh, well, at least we know it happened, right?
[104:19.68]It's all good.
[104:21.06]That's so funny.
[104:25.19]Alright, wait till he's ready.
[104:27.15]What is this, a taser?
[104:35.81]Good citizens of Ulrichshafen.
[104:39.01]This morning, we gather to witness the execution of this poor sinner.
[104:45.04]The murderer, Hensla Hoomson.
[104:48.36]Hensla, also known as Stubborn Marty, is a thief and a robber.
[104:54.92]He roamed the countryside, attacking isolated farmsteads by night.
[105:00.90]The family Stiglitzen.
[105:03.29]The family Meissner.
[105:05.63]Kraus, Arichler, Merkel, and more.
[105:10.95]He, along with three companions, bound, tortured, and did violence to innocent people, robbing them of money, clothes, and forcing himself upon women and girls.
[105:25.09]That ain't good enough for him!
[105:26.83]These crimes, being against the law of the land, my lords have decreed and given sentence that this man shall be condemned from life to death by the sword.
[105:41.70]Do you have any final words?
[105:44.52]Obey, though.
[105:46.22]You're too calm.
[105:48.41]What a fine introduction you've given me.
[105:50.48]I'm a great man of form which is said to be a short one.
[105:56.20]Get on with it.
[105:57.82]Good Christian people, I ain't come hither to die.
[106:02.06]I have lived a life of a sinner, and an apple one at that.
[106:07.36]Therefore, I have offended my Lord God.
[106:11.07]I've been told by these kind lords that I must ask him heartily for forgiveness.
[106:17.59]Sorry, God.
[106:18.81]We'll do it again, I swear.
[106:20.53]Get his head on the block once and for all.
[106:23.89]Into your hands.
[106:26.53]Oh, can't we just get on with it?
[106:28.43]I've got places to be.
[106:31.31]Why is that funny?
[106:31.92]What?
[106:32.08]That was hilarious.
[106:33.44]That was like a fucking episode of Friends.
[106:36.78]What was that?
[106:37.36]I command my spirit.
[106:40.81]May God have mercy upon your soul.
[106:45.67]Executioner, you may proceed.
[106:48.05]That's me?
[106:48.29]Okay.
[106:48.53]Down on your knees, sinner.
[106:50.44]Down.
[106:52.86]Down.
[106:54.88]There it is.
[106:55.66]Okay.
[106:57.38]By the powers between God, you, man, and us, we have decried that you will be executed very swiftly under the eyes of God and of this kingdom.
[107:08.48]I decry in three seconds, three, two, one, your head will be removed from your body.
[107:14.57]One, zero.
[107:18.83]Well done.
[107:19.23]You have executed as judgment and law have required.
[107:27.14]That was an exemplary performance.
[107:29.02]Thank you.
[107:30.06]Here's your pay, plus a small bonus.
[107:33.97]And you're going to die tomorrow.
[107:37.84]That was very loud.
[107:38.92]A stubborn man.
[107:40.44]Right up until the end.
[107:42.42]Give him a golf swing.
[107:45.90]A golf swing.
[107:46.97]I'm going to golf swing the next verse.
[107:49.23]A good death should be a drama of divine redemption.
[107:53.48]The poor sinner acknowledges and atones for their crimes.
[107:57.34]Look at that gut.
[108:00.23]In return, they're granted a swift death and the promise of salvation.
[108:04.95]So I'm going to sit like this and I'm going to let it out and I want someone to add like a fart sound when it comes out.
[108:09.57]Let us hope that our next convict is more compliant.
[108:14.59]Just time to relax and have a good day and just chill after a nice long day of work.
[108:21.59]I want like a...
[108:37.40]Alright, nice and clean.
[108:40.66]Chopping.
[108:51.45]Ah!
[108:55.54]Yeah, I promise I will golf swing the next person.
[109:01.70]This game's gonna make me puke.
[109:03.26]You're in colorblind mode?
[109:07.93]I don't know if I'm feeling it, but I think I might have to change.
[109:12.09]Would you like a sip of this before we get started?
[109:23.41]What?
[109:38.62]What's going on?
[109:39.18]This is my reward!
[109:40.92]Quiet!
[109:42.04]Do not interrupt me.
[109:44.06]After all I did for you folks.
[109:46.20]This man has been found guilty of stabbing a ditch digger by the name of Michael Schober.
[109:52.15]Stabbing?
[109:52.45]Near the west gate.
[109:53.83]Who supposedly begged from him.
[109:56.27]He had an evil look in his eye.
[109:59.03]When a nearby citizen, Peter Cochrill, asked why he had attacked the ditch-digger, Mattis, enraged, stabbed Herr Cochrill too.
[110:10.73]He was soon after arrested by the town guard.
[110:14.23]They'll happily pay you to kill when it suits them.
[110:18.05]Then act all upset the one time it don't.
[110:21.99]And I'm the sinner.
[110:23.07]These crimes being against the law of the land.
[110:26.09]And that's serious.
[110:26.77]The laws have decreed and given sentence that this man shall be condemned from life to death by the sword.
[110:34.89]Do you have any more final words?
[110:37.63]Now fuck it.
[110:39.25]Get on with it.
[110:41.19]Father, into your hands I commend.
[110:45.33]Hey.
[110:47.99]May God have mercy upon your soul.
[110:53.37]What the fuck?
[110:54.51]Okay.
[111:16.67]He's taking my backswing.
[111:26.19]His head came off, it would have been way funnier.
[111:28.85]Can you imagine someone like an executioner just fucking queues up a golf swing and cuts like the mayor's head off?
[111:40.65]Oh shit, sorry!
[111:44.42]Oh my god.
[111:47.10]Mr. Bean.
[111:48.70]Ugh.
[111:53.02]Punch him?
[111:53.56]Wait, can I punch?
[111:54.71]I want to try punching the next person.
[111:59.45]I'm kind of getting a headache in this game.
[112:03.47]This is interesting though.
[112:05.39]You know what?
[112:08.31]I'll tell you.
[112:09.51]People have interesting ideas for games.
[112:12.10]Especially VR games.
[112:14.25]Like, you're the executioner.
[112:16.65]Like, that's a cool idea.
[112:17.81]I like it.
[112:18.17]Alright.
[112:20.45]I'm going to try punching somebody with death.
[112:24.41]Wicked backswing.
[112:26.92]Welcome, executioner.
[112:29.20]I see you.
[112:31.76]I can't believe we didn't get to see him fall down.
[112:34.22]I look forward to working with you.
[112:38.50]At least there wasn't a shooting range tutorial in this one.
[112:41.52]That's true.
[112:44.24]Oh.
[112:46.34]Oh, God.
[112:46.93]Oh, I hate that when that happens.
[112:57.33]Turn off colorblind mode?
[112:59.65]I don't think this... This is not colorblind mode.
[113:01.67]...the execution of this poor sinner.
[113:05.29]The murderer, Hensla Holmeson.
[113:08.62]Hensla, also known as Stubborn Marty, is a thief and a robber.
[113:15.22]He roamed the countryside, attacking isolated farmsteads by night.
[113:21.13]the family Stiglitzen, the family Meischner, Krauss, Arichler, Merkel, and more.
[113:31.19]He, along with three companions, bound, tortured, and did violence to innocent people, robbing them of money, clothes, and forcing himself upon women and girls.
[113:46.04]Get off the stage!
[113:47.36]Get off the stage!
[113:50.21]Get off the stage!
[113:51.63]Get off the stage!
[113:52.57]Fuck, I can't- Hold on.
[113:54.37]Do you have any final words?
[113:55.67]Albedo, you're too-
[114:11.66]Fuuuup!
[114:30.84]Take me alive you fuckers I'm sorry I can't This game is fantastic
[114:50.49]This sorry individual disobeyed orders in an act of meaningless violence.
[114:56.07]What's wrong with you?
[114:56.71]I don't know.
[114:57.35]There can be only one punishment for such an act of disloyalty and ingratitude.
[115:03.54]Alright, I'm... Something about the... I don't know.
[115:06.34]I have to change games.
[115:07.06]That was very good, though.
[115:08.18]I can't... May God have mercy upon your soul.
[115:19.05]That was so funny.
[115:20.19]Oh, I can't see what you guys are saying.
[115:24.37]Um... What do I want to do?
[115:28.98]What do you guys think?
[115:29.68]Where should I go?
[115:32.82]We want Boneworks?
[115:34.94]No.
[115:36.54]No, I'm not playing Boneworks.
[115:39.86]SCP?
[115:40.50]No, no, no, no.
[115:47.22]SCP is for Halloween.
[115:51.17]play the Poker Stars game?
[115:53.71]Beat Saber?
[115:55.20]Tilt Brush?
[115:55.68]I'm not going to play Trover.
[116:01.14]That's for Halloween.
[116:03.38]Bladesmith?
[116:04.94]I kind of want to try this.
[116:06.14]I'm going to play Hell Split.
[116:08.77]I got this a long time ago and it looked like it was potentially interesting.
[116:11.63]I want to try it.
[116:16.69]I have so many VR games, guys.
[116:19.29]It's insane how many I have.
[116:21.94]We have VR content for, like, the next year.
[116:26.18]But going forward, I am going to do it probably seated.
[116:30.42]Or, like, seated and standing.
[116:31.50]Because it just absolutely wrecks me every time.
[116:35.44]Especially now.
[116:38.92]I burped again.
[116:39.56]Alright.
[116:39.98]Hell split.
[116:40.58]Did I play this before?
[116:41.50]I have, like, skeleton hands.
[116:48.87]Oh, and it's an index game.
[116:49.85]Alright.
[116:51.36]You got my, you got my interest so far.
[116:58.05]Rendering scale.
[116:59.29]Get that, get that to 100% please.
[117:02.37]No vibration.
[117:03.25]Wait, maybe should, should I?
[117:04.89]Okay.
[117:06.83]Game.
[117:08.59]Uh, new profile.
[117:09.61]Choose your VR experience.
[117:10.81]Standing.
[117:16.90]Why do I think my mouth is gonna move?
[117:26.74]It tracks pretty well.
[117:33.13]That's a pretty good track.
[117:41.14]What is 175?
[117:41.44]I don't know.
[117:44.76]Can I change my face?
[117:57.54]Alright.
[117:58.16]Campaign.
[117:59.54]Normal.
[118:04.34]Do you remember the days of your earthly life, warrior?
[118:07.85]You're two feet tall?
[118:09.33]They were full of glory and bravery.
[118:12.69]So many times you brought peace and justice to your land.
[118:16.61]I did.
[118:17.85]When you became the defender of your kingdom, we called you the first of equals.
[118:23.05]To your last battle, thousands of other fearless warriors followed you.
[118:28.00]You were so many that the dust from your feet covered the morning sun.
[118:32.62]Do you remember how your people despised death?
[118:37.48]How bravely they fought?
[118:40.06]5'6".
[118:40.57]I'm not 5'6".
[118:41.41]I literally have bare feet socks on.
[118:44.49]On the ground.
[118:45.47]And it's based on how tall your base stations are.
[118:49.29]My base stations are huge.
[118:50.95]I have them up really high pointing down.
[118:52.66]I'm 5'8".
[118:52.78]Everybody laugh.
[118:53.16]It's fine.
[118:53.64]I'm 5'8".
[119:00.90]I'm not 5'5".
[119:01.78]It's the base stations.
[119:02.85]It's the way it's my bare socks on the ground.
[119:04.79]I'm 5'8".
[119:05.25]Everybody relax.
[119:06.47]Executionary game is fucking hilarious.
[119:07.87]It's good artwork.
[119:08.65]I like the tiered, layered system they have here.
[119:12.53]...managed to bend the fallen warriors to their black will.
[119:30.53]Like plague, their innumerable legions blazed across the deserted lands.
[119:36.39]Since that time, the eternal darkness fell... Oops.
[119:45.04]Welcome home, brave warrior.
[119:47.82]Here you can find everything you need.
[119:49.66]This place is beyond space and time.
[119:52.04]I look like I'm made out of clay.
[119:54.14]I look like clayvation.

[120:57.24]Otherwise I'm gonna look like a fucking wuss!
[120:59.10]Oh, come on!
[121:07.88]Who needs a dentist?
[121:15.20]Okay, I'm ready.
[121:22.23]Kill all opponents.
[121:25.37]Oh, I need that, I think.
[121:26.27]I greet you at the arena of the old cemetery.
[121:31.15]You are about to fight the best warriors of the past.
[121:35.94]Do you want to know who I am?
[121:38.28]Oh, shit.
[121:38.82]You will soon find out.
[121:41.90]Don't you even attempt to see me.
[121:45.11]I am everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
[121:49.87]Okay.
[121:50.91]But this minor circumstance does not stop me from watching you.
[121:55.53]Watch out with the bird shit.
[121:56.39]Try not to let me down.
[122:00.49]Wait, I gotta go.
[122:01.68]Come on, Dad!

[122:43.81]I like it.
[122:44.17]Is this a banana?
[122:46.69]Oh, you are good.
[122:53.79]Oh, my God.
[122:54.73]How do I eat the banana?
[122:56.77]How do I eat a banana?
[123:08.29]Okay, that works too.
[123:17.73]How do I eat the... Oh, God damn it.
[123:23.21]Oh.
[123:28.21]Oh, I need that.
[123:36.81]Weapon!
[123:51.66]I want the other weapon.
[123:56.08]Hey.
[123:56.26]Okay.
[123:58.00]What do we say about this?
[124:02.35]See how fucking strong I am?
[124:04.09]You wouldn't do this.
[124:04.99]You wouldn't do it.
[124:08.57]Ow.
[124:10.58]Ow.
[124:12.42]Ow.
[124:16.66]Oh, I just like almost ripped.
[124:17.60]I just pulled my pants off.
[124:19.24]I was caught in here and pulled my pants off.
[124:35.62]What's next?
[124:37.10]This is fun.
[124:46.59]Round one.
[124:47.41]Ooh.
[124:48.31]I didn't get a trophy?
[124:50.07]Why?
[124:55.54]Hit yourself in the face?
[125:00.70]Chapter one.
[125:01.46]No, I don't want to do chapter one again.
[125:04.76]Can I do anything else?
[125:05.92]What's this?
[125:09.79]Choose your equipment and opponents for a battle.
[125:13.45]Swords?
[125:15.75]Nordic sword?
[125:18.04]One-handed grab.
[125:20.45]Short sword.
[125:21.31]One hand.
[125:21.97]Nordic sword.
[125:22.51]I want to do Nordic sword.
[125:25.31]Do I not have enough?
[125:25.89]1,100 gold?
[125:26.79]Um, how do I buy it?
[125:31.45]Buy.
[125:31.65]Oh, price.
[125:32.13]It's 2,300.
[125:32.33]Fuck.
[125:32.45]1,200?
[125:32.47]For a Francisca?
[125:35.07]A double Francisca?
[125:48.59]How about a Francisco?
[125:58.42]Cool.
[126:00.40]Alright.
[126:02.60]Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
[126:04.92]Good to know.
[126:07.56]Chapter one, earn extra gold armory.
[126:09.27]Wait.
[126:11.09]Oh, okay.
[126:11.49]I can do this.
[126:13.37]Oops.
[126:13.59]Okay.
[126:15.69]How do I get my other weapon?
[126:19.00]Excuse me?
[126:19.52]There's a jump?
[126:29.58]Okay, I did it.
[126:30.20]We're gonna have to- Alright, let's go.
[126:31.86]How do I climb?
[126:46.55]Who's next?
[126:48.27]Oh yeah, come on down here.
[127:33.26]This is so stupid.
[127:39.00]That's very efficient.
[127:50.00]Come on, come here.
[127:59.17]My foot just comes up.
[128:00.25]Alright, I'm gonna take this thing down.
[128:02.21]I gotta be careful.
[128:09.69]I won!
[128:09.91]Yeah, where's the axe?
[128:12.95]Alright, hold on a second.
[128:22.39]We are very tangled.
[128:28.30]One more, maybe more than that.
[128:30.04]Holy shit, this is really, this is really badly tangled.
[128:40.64]Alright, we're good.
[128:43.56]Portable VR needs to happen.
[128:44.78]They already exist, but I think they're not as high fidelity as an index, right?
[128:49.62]Because you can get the quest.
[128:53.26]That thing's not that expensive, is it?
[128:55.37]It's just like a wireless headset.
[128:57.61]Cemetery round two.
[128:58.33]I want a weapon.
[129:00.79]Where's my weapon?
[129:06.27]Do I have to bring it with me?
[129:08.84]How do I bring this with me?
[129:09.54]Do I have like an inventory?
[129:11.48]I think I just took it with me.
[129:20.36]The quest 2 is pretty good.
[129:21.42]There we go.
[129:25.27]Alright.
[129:27.49]I don't have my...
[129:36.98]Oh!
[129:38.02]Holy shit.
[129:39.12]That was cool.
[129:44.94]Nice.
[129:45.66]Oh, he just cut his arm off.
[129:58.89]And his head.
[130:00.33]This guy's head is made out of steel.
[130:01.54]What the fuck?
[130:03.90]Good shit.
[130:09.30]Die!
[130:09.72]Got it.
[130:11.04]Holy f- Give me that back.
[130:25.62]It worked.
[130:34.52]Oh!
[130:34.80]That was sick!
[130:43.60]Uh-oh.
[130:49.19]Uh-oh.
[130:49.47]Thank you.
[130:50.17]Thank you, bird.
[131:02.53]Into the spikes.
[131:08.84]Get up.
[131:09.28]I want to go in there.
[131:09.92]Spike, spike, spike.
[131:10.52]Get up.
[131:18.81]Get on those spikes, yeah!
[131:28.38]Get over there!
[131:29.02]Aww, what the fuck.
[131:41.76]Dying light moment?
[131:44.48]Oh, I hate that.
[131:47.79]Grab them with your hands.
[131:55.36]I gotta close my eyes when I press that button.
[132:00.49]Grab, grab them and move around?
[132:17.09]Trying to snap his neck.
[132:27.63]Come on!
[132:38.71]It's not as easy as it looks on TV!
[132:52.61]I can't... Is somebody behind me?
[133:05.33]Oh shit.
[133:08.97]Oh my god!
[133:14.21]Ow!
[133:18.05]I don't have a weapon, but at least I have his hand that has a weapon!
[133:22.84]Come here!
[133:31.31]Kill him!
[133:39.49]What?
[133:56.97]Give me his head!
[134:00.13]Give me the sword!
[134:01.53]Okay, stay right there!
[134:03.36]Stay!
[134:03.98]Stay!
[134:04.78]You motherfucker!
[134:07.02]Dude, come here!
[134:09.06]Give me that!
[134:17.77]God!
[134:20.21]Get it!
[134:26.52]I got it!
[134:39.89]Don't you understand?
[134:41.69]Don't you get it?
[134:43.41]Don't you get it?
[134:44.19]Think!
[134:58.32]Fuck!
[135:02.75]Into the spikes!
[135:03.45]Into the spikes!
[135:10.54]My pants fall down.
[135:18.97]That hurt.
[135:25.35]And there's another one.
[135:27.27]And there's another one.
[135:29.15]Is there a health potion?
[135:41.56]Oh, fuck.
[136:05.57]Got it.
[136:10.87]What?
[136:11.31]Where are we?
[136:22.74]Oh, my God.
[136:23.68]Kill this motherfucker.
[136:32.52]Oh, my God.
[136:33.46]Come here.
[136:41.57]I won?
[136:41.89]Alright.
[136:49.90]Fuck.
[136:55.18]Windows firewall.
[136:58.99]You choking?
[137:01.31]I have enough for another weapon.
[137:06.88]Fuck.
[137:08.42]Fuck, I'm draining.
[137:10.56]I'm losing steam.
[137:12.82]I'm losing steam.
[137:22.23]What else we got?
[137:23.09]I got 4,000 bucks.
[137:25.49]There we go, straight sword.
[137:27.05]Yep.
[137:40.40]Ow, I want to hold it with two hands.
[137:42.56]Can I not?
[137:46.86]Alright, well, whatever.
[137:54.43]It's on your butt?
[137:56.69]What's on my butt?
[138:00.16]Alright, we're going to... I'm going to do one more and then we're going to do a chill game.
[138:25.45]Dead.
[138:27.47]Whew.
[138:30.73]Who's next?
[138:33.45]Oh, alright.
[138:34.07]You.
[138:34.35]Ah!
[138:34.41]Ah!
[138:36.23]Ah!
[138:48.13]Come on!
[138:50.78]That was easy!
[138:51.40]Alright, how about we- let's do a real fight one-on-one, you and me.
[139:14.44]Real sword fight, okay?
[139:16.47]Just like they do whenever you like to- Fucking idiot.
[139:24.01]Oh.
[139:24.71]Still alive.
[139:25.24]Step on his head.
[139:49.52]Where's my weapon?
[139:50.14]I need my weapon back.
[139:50.84]Is that a grenade?
[140:05.55]Holy shit, it's a grenade.
[140:12.98]Okay.
[140:16.72]Well, there goes that one.
[140:24.86]Alright, I need to, I need to assess.
[140:31.25]Let me see what we got here.
[140:34.69]I need something a little more low-key.
[140:35.73]You gonna puke?
[140:46.69]I don't think, I don't think I'm gonna puke.
[140:54.77]No, I'm not going to puke.
[140:56.77]What do we got?
[140:57.55]We got... Is D-Rail Valley any good?
[141:04.92]I still have this for a long time.
[141:06.34]Alright, we're going to play D-Rail Valley.
[141:11.97]I think you just ride around on a train.
[141:13.27]It's like fun.
[141:13.61]Alright, we're going in D-Rail Valley.
[141:22.68]Be careful.
[141:23.14]I'm alright.
[141:23.62]I'll be alright for like another 20, 30 minutes.
[141:26.90]And by the way, if you missed the beginning of the stream, Thursday we're doing a battleship tournament with Ludwig.
[141:33.32]It's going to be on Ludwig's channel.
[141:37.23]Eight contestants.
[141:38.21]I'm one of them.
[141:40.71]And then Sunday we're streaming The Sims 2.
[141:42.73]Been talking about that for a while.
[141:45.15]It'll be a lot of fun.
[141:47.53]And I'm going to talk about something very important on Sunday.
[141:54.04]Alright, let's do D-Rail Valley.
[141:58.06]Oh, man.
[141:58.98]This has been a fun day, though.
[142:01.56]I got to take care of this.
[142:05.31]I would give the last few games we played A pluses in fun factor.
[142:09.77]That was funny.
[142:13.57]Am I even?
[142:13.97]Okay.
[142:15.89]What the fuck is going on here?
[142:17.07]Is it even doing anything?
[142:18.16]I think so.
[142:25.90]Yeah, but this will be the last VR stream for a little while.
[142:29.48]It's absolutely decimating me.
[142:32.12]I can't lie to you.
[142:35.29]Alright, one more turn should do it.
[142:38.83]Okay, that looks good.
[142:41.39]Alright, D-Rail Valley.
[142:45.38]Let me take a sip.
[142:57.54]And we'll see from there.
[143:01.56]Ah, that's from Goodside.
[143:05.60]I don't think I need to come out any at all.
[143:08.46]I feel like this won't be very long.
[143:10.70]But this has been a fucking blast as it always is.
[143:12.72]I just wish I had more stamina for it nowadays.
[143:15.42]I just don't.
[143:17.44]Especially now.
[143:18.72]It's sad and it pisses me off.
[143:22.98]Wrong?
[143:23.18]Okay, there we go.
[143:24.80]Alright, D-Rail Valley.
[143:26.38]Wait, would it be up here?
[143:30.95]I think this is a game where you drive a train, right?
[143:39.48]Old man, yeah.
[143:44.46]Playing VR for more than hours is not just you, it's not easy.
[143:48.62]No, it really isn't, even back when I was feeling a little better.
[143:54.20]But since this bullshit...
[143:57.23]It's been kind of even harder to do.
[143:59.58]Which sucks, because I love doing this shit.
[144:01.38]It's a lot of fun.
[144:01.92]Probably the vaccine as well.
[144:14.29]I think I'm okay.
[144:15.51]I don't think I'm going to start feeling a problem until probably at least a few hours from now.
[144:20.31]Alright, welcome to D-Rail Valley, Engineer.
[144:22.71]Let's get you to a train driver's license.
[144:24.91]Okay.
[144:26.03]Okay.
[144:27.58]Try turning around, flick the joystick.
[144:33.88]Great.
[144:34.46]How do you dash?
[144:36.40]Hold the mark button, point somewhere, and release.
[144:38.42]Okay, it's teleport.
[144:42.10]Cool.
[144:44.72]Can you get hit by a train?
[144:48.21]Um... No, we can keep it off.

[151:24.60]How do I turn the page?
[151:26.74]It's supposed to be trigger.
[151:29.48]I can't turn the page.
[151:32.78]Hold trigger and move joystick.
[151:34.62]What the fuck?

[153:57.77]Release the throttle.
[153:59.11]To stop, apply the brake.
[154:05.49]Flip the fuse boxes.
[154:06.51]Go.
[154:07.27]They're up.
[154:09.41]Turn the ignition on clockwise.

[155:00.62]Why did we go backwards?
[155:07.88]Why did we go backwards?
[155:09.90]It told me to do this.
[155:14.46]It told me to do that.

[176:39.38]Where should I go for the drums?
[176:42.96]Backstage?
[176:49.48]Why didn't you test the weapon?

[176:51.41]It's going to go...
[176:57.82]Alright, this is a drum kit.
[177:00.29]Well, there is a drum kit, isn't there?
[178:00.92]Not quite my tempo.
[178:02.16]Can you play the guitar?

[178:58.58]I don't... The story so far...
[179:04.17]Get me the fuck out of here.
[179:10.97]I can't just quit?
[179:14.28]You can't read?
[179:15.72]Why are there like eight iPad game menus?
[179:18.56]Like what?
[179:19.44]I just wanna play.
[179:23.74]How do I get out of here?

[179:31.04]Go, go.
[179:31.52]Alright, I'm here, I'm playing.
[179:42.05]I can't quit this.
[179:44.61]Did I actually just restart the entire game?
[179:55.24]Just quit the game?
[180:03.61]If I come back in, is it going to... I want to play the next level.
[180:08.99]I want to do level two.
[180:17.97]The man stomps in circles shouting at nothing.
[180:29.64]Okay.
[180:30.54]World Tour.

[180:45.00]Pawn to die, purgatory.
[180:47.42]The story so far, walk this way.

[181:18.09]Take a full rider to the hotel and cause 800 damage.
[181:22.63]Cause $300 of subtotal damages and escape before the maid tries to get in.
[181:26.65]Alright.
[181:27.65]I think I can do it like this.
[181:29.61]Ready?
[181:34.67]That does not do even remotely the amount of damage I thought it was going to do.
[181:38.90]Why?
[181:39.22]Okay.
[181:41.56]I need to do 300 bucks of damage before the maid gets in.
[181:43.32]I need something heavy.
[181:49.13]God damn it.
[181:51.87]He's scammed.
[181:53.65]If I can take out that wall and maybe the toilet.
[181:55.70]Okay, I'm going to the bathroom.
[181:56.42]I'm going to take the toilet out.
[182:04.70]Right?
[182:04.88]I'm just going to come in here and just start swinging.
[182:11.49]You ready?
[182:18.46]Come on, hurry up, hurry up, come on, go, go, go, go.
[182:19.86]Got it.

[182:23.32]Nope.
[182:23.88]I hear you in there stealing ropes.
[182:48.28]I'll just let myself in.
[182:52.06]Close the fucking thing.
[182:54.22]I didn't want to come in anyway.
[183:01.61]Kill her.

[183:04.19]I need to destroy this shit.
[183:06.31]Holy shit!

[184:02.00]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[184:06.74]What's the best way to just- okay.
[184:08.89]That thing sucks.
[184:16.21]300 damage before the maid gets in, and then just don't hurt yourself.
[184:19.27]Alright, I'm trashing everything in the bathroom with this.
[184:23.96]Let's go.
[184:33.57]Shit.
