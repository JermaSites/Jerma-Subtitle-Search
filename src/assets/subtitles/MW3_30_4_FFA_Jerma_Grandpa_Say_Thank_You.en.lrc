[00:00.91]Hey, what is happening guys?
[00:02.61]Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[00:04.81]Today I'm going to be playing on Modern Warfare 3.
[00:07.37]This is a 30 and 4.
[00:09.93]I did pretty well in this gameplay.
[00:11.53]This is on... I don't even know what map this is on.
[00:14.61]So, I apologize for that.
[00:17.63]But, anyways, a 30 and 4 with the PPM-91.
[00:21.40]And my secondary is the Old West Revolver.
[00:24.98]That's what I call it.
[00:25.74]Even though that's not what it's called, that's what I call it.
[00:28.24]The perks I'm going to be using are Hardline Pro, Sleight of Hand Pro, and Steady Aim Pro.
[00:34.46]For those hip-fire accuracies, baby.
[00:38.04]And also, the killstreaks I'm going to be using are UAV at 3, Predator Missile at 5, and the Attack Helicopter at 7.
[00:45.63]And I get the Attack Helicopter a couple times.
[00:48.59]So I do work in this gameplay, guys.
[00:50.73]I do a whole lot of work, especially with that little revolver.
[00:53.59]I kill like four people with that damn thing.
[00:56.18]And I want to give a massive, massive thank you to everybody that supported my first video on Respawn.
[01:03.56]As of right now, it's sitting at like 60,000 views and 3,000 likes or something like that.
[01:09.16]Something crazy.
[01:10.44]And I'm speechless, guys.
[01:12.62]That's awesome.
[01:13.86]And I'm really happy that it's going to be a weekly show every Friday.
[01:18.04]Thanks for supporting me.
[01:19.00]Thanks for supporting the channel.
[01:20.49]You guys are awesome.
[01:21.39]I'm so happy.
[01:22.05]I was scared.
[01:22.95]I was scared to death when I uploaded that because I didn't know what the response was going to be.
[01:27.67]I had no idea.
[01:28.79]I thought half the people were going to be like, get this crap out of here.
[01:32.81]I hate you.
[01:33.99]But it turns out people really seem to like it.
[01:36.56]So thank you.
[01:38.00]Thank you, everybody.
[01:39.60]And if you're new, if you're one of the people that came over from Respawn, then welcome, and I hope you guys enjoy the stuff I put up.
[01:46.86]Oh, and somebody else wants to say thank you, and I'm sure you guys know who it is.
[01:51.73]So let me get him down here.
[01:53.86]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say thank you for supporting my video that I put up on Respawn.
[02:01.52]And if there's one thing I can tell you, is that I'm gonna make sure that the videos on there are gonna be super fun and awesome and good.
[02:09.52]And if you don't like it, then fuck you.
[02:11.41]Okay, I gotta go back to my sleep.
[02:14.15]So there you go.
[02:16.83]Grandpa says thank you.
[02:19.34]So let's talk about the gameplay for a minute here.
[02:21.84]I want to bring up something really important.
[02:23.76]Now, I'm very new to this series, guys.
[02:26.35]I can't give you a whole lot of crazy tips and strategies and stuff like that.
[02:30.55]But if there's one thing I can tell you, take a look right here.
[02:33.33]This is an outdoor map.
[02:35.07]That's a two-piece right there with the Predator missile.
[02:37.59]If you are not on an outdoor map, the Predator missile is pretty much completely and totally useless.
[02:43.86]And I run with it all the time, and I really shouldn't be.
[02:47.48]If you're gonna be on an outdoor map, definitely use the Predator Missile, because if you're not on an outdoor map, if you go in a place like, that's mostly indoors, a lot of people can hide around corners and stuff like that inside a building, you're not gonna be able to kill anybody with the Predator Missile, and you're just gonna drop it on a rooftop.
[03:02.97]I do that so often, I can't even count how many times I've done that.
[03:07.47]Now, I know that you can't tell exactly what map you're gonna go to, it's pretty random, because there's no dedicated servers in this game yet, and I don't think there will be.
[03:16.20]Does anybody know if, at least for the PC version, will there ever be dedicated servers for the PC version?
[03:21.68]Because if not, that's kind of weird, because Black Ops had them.
[03:24.66]I played Black Ops on the free weekend, and they had a ton of dedicated servers, there was a whole server browser list.
[03:31.21]so I don't know what's up with that I guess they're not doing it I don't know but what I found is if you make a second class with the same weapons items and everything perks everything except you change the killstreaks then you can change your class mid-game but you don't change anything but the killstreaks
[03:47.82]So if you go to an indoor map, you can pick your indoor killstreaks, quote-unquote.
[03:51.97]Or if you go to an outdoor map, you can pick your outdoor killstreaks.
[03:55.35]And I know that sounds kind of like a no-brainer, and people probably already know that, but, like I said, I'm new to the series, new to the game.
[04:01.04]These are things I'm just finding out right now.
[04:03.83]So take a look at the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
[04:06.48]You'll see my ammo count after I kill this guy.
[04:09.56]I have three shots left in this gun.
[04:12.00]I do not have scavenger on, so I can't pick up any ammo on the ground.
[04:15.76]So I shoot this guy like three times, and then I pull out the revolver.
[04:19.50]Well, no, this guy over here, this dude.
[04:21.51]Pull out the revolver, bang, bang, bang, and now I do the rest of the work with this revolver, and I kill a bunch of people with it.
[04:28.41]It's actually kind of crazy.
[04:29.45]I was surprised.
[04:30.69]There's another kill right there.
[04:31.79]I was so surprised that I got this many kills with just the secondary.
[04:35.46]And I really like the secondaries.
[04:36.74]I think the secondaries are a lot of fun in this game.
[04:39.00]Pop, pop, pop.
[04:39.78]There's one for you.
[04:40.56]Wait, is he going to kill me?
[04:41.42]No, he's not.
[04:42.72]And looking back at this all, I probably should have used somebody else's gun that was on the ground.
[04:49.09]Now, when I play these games, guys, I get really into the zone and I forget a whole lot of basic game mechanics.
[04:55.99]It's the same way for any other game for me.
[04:57.85]I just zone out, my brain kind of turns off, and my gaming instincts just take over.
[05:03.58]And I just tell myself, you know what, I'm gonna get six kills with this gun.
[05:07.40]And I don't care, I'm not gonna do anything else.
[05:09.86]It's crazy, I know.
[05:11.34]But right now I'm out of ammo, so I just jump around the corner to try and slash this guy, but it doesn't work.
[05:17.15]Whipping out the predator missile, trying to drop it on these two hooligans over here.
[05:21.28]Only get one.
[05:22.56]Drop it right on his head.
[05:24.57]Probably surprise the hell out of that guy.
[05:28.20]Throwing down a bouncing Betty.
[05:30.06]Bouncing betties are kind of like a landmine.
[05:33.18]That's the only way I can really describe it.
[05:34.70]It's if somebody gets within a few feet, it makes a little tsk and explodes, and sometimes it catches people off guard.
[05:40.41]I have such horrible luck with grenades in this game.
[05:43.49]I can't time grenades for shit in this game.
[05:46.67]Oh my god.
[05:48.21]I am the worst at grenades in this game.
[05:50.93]Coming down to the end of the gameplay now.
[05:52.67]This is the last couple of kills.
[05:54.00]I get one guy here.
[05:54.96]One dude over around this corner lies down.
[05:56.94]Shoot him in his face.
[05:58.20]Get the UAV to get the final kill.
[06:00.48]And the final kill cam because it is free for all.
[06:03.40]Thank you everybody so much for watching.
[06:05.21]I really do appreciate it.
[06:06.67]I will see you guys all next time.
[06:08.69]And take care everybody.
