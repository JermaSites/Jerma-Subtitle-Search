[00:39.44]No, no facecam.
[00:40.74]I don't have any clothes on.
[00:42.06]I don't have a robe today either.
[00:55.39]I'm not even wearing a robe.
[00:58.27]Just got no clothes on.
[01:03.22]Bad gameplays, bad streamer.
[01:05.91]Just wait til- Look, I'm gonna go on an apology tour, alright?
[01:08.83]Just wait til everybody gets in here.
[01:11.07]You know the teacher?
[01:12.85]The teacher in the class fucks up a lesson.
[01:16.74]Like, you talk about evolution or something, and the teacher is at the chalkboard, and he's drawing out, like, a frog.
[01:22.42]He draws a bird, and he goes...
[01:25.00]Okay, so students, yeah, so we got the frog here, and the frog eventually was able to get onto land, and became a bird.
[01:32.14]And everyone, all the students are like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[01:36.20]Frogs don't become birds.
[01:38.06]And then he corrects the class, he's like, excuse me, I'm the teacher, you're the students.
[01:44.00]And everyone's like, okay, whatever, and they write it down in their notebooks, and they're like, this guy's fucking stupid.
[01:48.85]And then the next day, the teacher then edits the article, right?
[01:53.58]Because he wrote an article about this, too, and he posted it on the school website.
[01:58.44]I'm going to edit that article once enough people get in here.
[02:07.68]Evolution.
[02:15.67]What?
[02:16.49]You'll see what I'm talking about.
[02:17.69]You see, already the students don't even know what the teacher's talking about, so I need to re-edit this lesson plan on the school website.
[02:30.04]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.
[02:30.94]I'm just gonna get prepared.
[02:58.21]No, there's no joke.
[03:00.31]There is no joke.
[03:03.40]There's Kingdom Come Deliverance on the screen.
[03:08.90]Oh, and you get the shitty English teacher.
[03:10.50]I'm actually, I could be a pretty good English teacher.
[03:14.41]I know my ABCs.
[03:19.86]That's really all that matters.
[03:21.20]But what is English?
[03:22.00]It's a series of letters.
[03:24.20]And the alphabet.
[03:25.12]I can teach you that.
[03:25.90]We can go start to front.
[03:28.60]We can go... Here we go.
[03:29.44]You ready?
[03:30.46]A, B, C, D, E, F, G. H, I, J, K, L, M, and a P. Q, R, S, V, U, T. W, X, Y, and Z. Um... That's all you need to know.
[03:40.55]Honestly.
[03:41.87]Alright.
[03:46.27]Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally.
[03:52.34]Alright, hold on.
[03:53.28]I need to wait until people get in here.
[03:58.01]Just give it a minute.
[04:04.77]You missed x to 2.
[04:09.67]Is doing the alphabet the same as counting?
[04:11.05]No.
[04:13.61]I wouldn't say so.
[04:17.06]But regardless... Alright, enough people have come in here now.
[04:22.38]Let's just talk about it.
[04:23.24]Let's do the apology tour.
[04:26.97]So the apology tour is going to go like this.
[04:31.89]The stream last night started bad.
[04:34.27]I was going to sit down and really give this game the attention it deserves.
[04:39.81]And like sometimes happens when I turn on my fucking stupid ass internet live streaming service provider.
[04:49.47]The first, like, 30 minutes of last night's stream really just fucked with my head.
[04:52.49]And I didn't think I was gonna stream.
[04:54.33]We were sitting there for, like, 30 to 40 minutes waiting for Comcast to let me play the game.
[05:00.34]And... It really threw me off.
[05:02.44]Threw me off for the rest of the night.
[05:04.12]And I was just being a fucking idiot.
[05:05.26]I was being, like, frustrated and annoyed and mean.
[05:08.52]It was not cool.
[05:09.32]It was not fun.
[05:11.20]So I'm sorry that that happened last night.
[05:14.79]It's just gonna happen again tonight.
[05:16.11]No, dude.
[05:25.02]No, no, no, no, no.
[05:26.14]But honestly, I, um... I saw people, a few comments, people talking about how they, like, were really frustrated with how I was acting last night, and I'm sorry.
[05:39.69]I really don't want to, like, piss people off.
[05:41.31]That's not my intention, obviously.
[05:44.15]But with the whole, like, the surgery, my mother, not being able to juggle streams that well, missing a whole week of streams...
[05:51.10]And I've kind of been all over the place.
[05:53.18]And... Add to that the internet problems.
[05:57.74]So... Sorry last night wasn't the best stream ever.
[06:04.85]I would put that somewhere around like... I would put it between... You get three bad ones, right?
[06:09.65]Like strike three, you're out.
[06:10.61]So you got... So Kingdom Come Deliverance, last night's version, sits somewhere between... I'd say like... It was definitely, definitely better than Skate 3.
[06:21.75]Like, I would say Skate 3.
[06:22.93]Skate 3 is the lowest common denominator for streams that I've ever done.
[06:26.40]Actually, I don't know.
[06:27.84]That's not true.
[06:28.48]I put Skate 3 and Karazhan probably in the same level.
[06:32.12]But Karazhan was actually kind of fun because it was content I was looking forward to.
[06:35.90]I liked Skate 3.
[06:42.10]What about Red Dead?
[06:42.86]Red Dead was awesome.
[06:43.75]What are you on about?
[06:45.89]I played through that whole game and it was a fucking fantastic game.
[06:48.29]Alright, anyways.
[06:51.80]Not every stream needs to be golden.
[06:52.92]It was fun to hang out.
[06:54.38]Yeah, but I get like that, man.
[06:55.82]I get like that sometimes where I just get so annoyed and frustrated that I get frustrated at my frustrations and I get angry at myself.
[07:03.74]And then I look over here and everyone's just like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[07:08.45]I'm just like, I don't, I don't know what I'm fucking doing.
[07:12.49]It just like, it keeps like collapsing onto itself sometimes.
[07:15.69]That happens like once a month.
[07:18.29]I thought that was a huge crow, but it's just a log.
[07:25.89]And even if the game is kind of slow to start and frustrating, I don't want to act like that.
[07:34.74]I don't want to be like a baby and be like, this game's not fucking good.
[07:38.98]Boring.
[07:40.43]Did I do that?
[07:41.33]I think I may have.
[07:43.11]But anyways, let's move on.
[07:46.99]We're going to give this game the time it deserves.
[07:51.26]The beginning of the Red Dead stream when you couldn't get it working was genuinely funny.
[07:55.91]You did that with spore.
[07:57.03]I do a lot of things and I just can't stop it.
[07:59.73]I can't help myself.
[08:03.01]I'm like that in real life, guys.
[08:04.75]Like seriously, if I miss like a turn or something, I'm going to give you a true story.
[08:10.32]This is an actual true story.
[08:13.40]My sense of direction is actually pretty bad in a car.
[08:17.45]I can drive a car very well.
[08:18.67]I drive all the fucking time.
[08:20.11]I drive into the city.
[08:22.12]I drive through the city.
[08:22.90]I drive across state lines.
[08:24.46]I literally drive all the time, every day.
[08:26.64]But if I didn't have a GPS...
[08:29.42]I would be lost forever.
[08:30.94]And that's because my sense of direction is terrible.
[08:34.27]So one time, a group of friends decided they were going to test my sense of direction and literally down the street from my house.
[08:42.39]This is we're talking about right down the street from my house in a car.
[08:47.26]They were like, take us here.
[08:49.16]This is before, by the way, before GPS ever was invented.
[08:52.60]So I go the one way that I think I know where I'm going.
[08:56.04]Alright, we're going to go to this KFC, okay?
[08:58.74]KFC, I'm just going to put that as a point of reference.
[09:02.24]And I get to a point where I don't know if it's the right turn or not.
[09:07.58]This is like two miles away from my house.
[09:09.80]And I'm just like, is this the right turn?
[09:11.52]I don't know.
[09:12.64]And I didn't take it.
[09:13.38]And that was the right turn.
[09:14.24]And they're like, dude, what are you doing?
[09:16.30]And I'm like, what are you talking about, man?
[09:18.81]Dude, that's right.
[09:19.65]I can turn around.
[09:20.61]I can go this way.
[09:21.55]And I took another turn, like a half mile up that road.
[09:25.57]And all my friends are laughing their asses off in the car.
[09:28.29]I don't even know where I am.
[09:30.19]And I'm driving around in circles, frustrated.
[09:33.19]Just like, I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[09:35.49]Which turn do I take?
[09:36.97]Which turn do I take?
[09:38.99]It's like, seriously, a studio audience laughing.
[09:42.92]I just got lost two miles away from my house on a side street.
[09:46.94]We were probably driving around in a circle for probably at least three to five minutes.
[09:52.18]And they were like, we're not telling you, dude.
[09:53.62]Why don't you find it?
[09:54.68]Why don't you figure it out?
[09:57.43]And like, I must have been purple.
[09:59.23]My face was probably green and purple at the same time.
[10:02.33]I was gripple.
[10:02.81]You know what I'm saying?
[10:04.49]I was equal parts sick and annoyed and frustrated.
[10:07.15]I was fucking gripple.
[10:11.89]Eventually, I figured it out.
[10:18.92]What kind of car do I have?
[10:21.54]What's the biggest car you're allowed to drive?
[10:24.52]Reverse that.
[10:26.40]Alright, so let's go.
[10:27.66]Let's start playing.
[10:30.66]The thing I'm doing right now is I just took this mission here to beat up three people.
[10:38.21]I need money.
[10:38.73]I did some stuff off stream, just like kind of walking around.
[10:43.29]So let's go back to where I was supposed to be.
[10:51.64]You just discovered a comboit.
[10:53.02]Comboit.
[10:53.84]Combat.
[10:54.36]I can't even say it.
[10:55.08]Combat exploit that makes combat in this game pointless.
[10:58.30]Really.
[10:59.46]Well, I'm using the controller now, so hopefully that's better.
[11:03.67]Something to do with the mouse was kind of screwing with me, too.
[11:07.27]I seem to have figured it out a little bit.
[11:11.53]So this is the town, and this is... I was told this is where the game opens up.
[11:17.26]I think this is the next guy I have to fight.
[11:18.50]Stephen.
[11:19.12]Stephen.
[11:23.64]I gotta fight three guys before I can fight the big guy.
[11:26.54]His name is Milan.
[11:27.28]Alright, so let's kick this guy's ass.
[11:38.62]You have to pay people to fight them.
[11:41.43]Here.
[11:42.43]It's two bucks.
[11:43.49]It's two dollars to punch a guy in the face.
[11:45.91]Here we go.
[11:49.43]So with the controller, it makes it a little better.
[12:00.22]Can only punch him straight.
[12:03.20]Give him a couple of jabs.
[12:09.06]That's a nice kick.
[12:10.22]Ain't gonna save you though.
[12:14.24]I got a good whack on him.
[12:19.76]I think you can level up something to be able to do that.
[12:22.58]To be able to make it so you do that more often, right?
[12:27.80]Something along those lines.
[12:34.32]Game's quiet?
[12:34.86]I'll turn it up in a second.
[12:36.96]Thanks for letting me know.
[12:41.68]Aww.
[12:44.00]Just mash when that happens?
[12:45.56]Really?
[12:46.04]Oh, I didn't know that.
[12:49.93]Oh, you're trying to go for the jab.
[12:51.21]Trying to go for the big swing, buddy.
[12:58.41]Oh, okay.
[13:00.57]You still got a kick on me, though.
[13:09.84]I wonder what's left-click on the controller.
[13:18.12]You can't take the one-two.
[13:21.24]Do I have Hearthstone open?
[13:23.04]No, hold on.
[13:26.28]Wait, I actually just checked to see if I had Hearthstone open.
[13:33.64]So as you can see, I figured out how to play the video game.
[13:38.94]Right?
[13:43.87]Wait, why am I picking him up?
[13:44.68]Whoops.
[13:47.14]Can I... This is the one thing I don't like about this mission is you have to... I have to go all the way back now.
[13:51.94]Just put him down.
[13:54.26]He had a lot of stuff.
[13:57.39]Take out the sword and mercy kill.
[13:59.39]No, I need to do the mission... I need to make money.
[14:01.37]Let me turn it up.
[14:07.26]I did turn it down a little bit.
[14:14.09]By the way, I'm really glad that they did this, because you can actually make the levels correct.
[14:19.67]Alright, let's go.
[14:24.40]Let's do a fast travel again.
[14:25.72]I stole a couple of things, by the way.
[14:29.10]Like, I've stolen at least five items.
[14:31.92]Now I gotta beat him.
[14:35.10]Bury him next to your village.
[14:38.71]I could find the ring that we did last night.
[14:44.61]Am I ready to beat this guy?
[14:45.91]I might not be ready to beat this guy.
[14:48.38]I'm gonna try it regardless.
[14:50.08]Let's see what I can do.
[14:57.32]How am I liking it?
[14:59.54]Just forget that last night existed.
[15:01.56]Can we just all have a brain...
[15:07.44]Like a brain flash here for a second, just like, didn't happen, you know what I mean?
[15:10.44]Just didn't happen.
[15:15.98]Let me, uh, I've already eaten.
[15:19.73]I think I can take him now.
[15:22.65]I'm fairly confident I will beat this guy.
[15:26.39]Yeah, I streamed the game yesterday.
[15:27.71]I streamed the game, I was literally just flailing around like an idiot the whole time.
[15:35.97]The only defense I'm going to give myself, right?
[15:38.59]I have one point of defense.
[15:41.71]Is I did run into, like... First of all, we had... It was like about two to three hours of cutscenes.
[15:47.16]Right?
[15:48.18]Which I'm an incredibly impatient person.
[15:50.84]I wish I wasn't, but I am.
[15:53.28]And... We ran into like three or four just bugs that made me want to delete the game.
[15:59.37]At the point when I couldn't go through the door in the house That was when like I was just like it hit the apex and I'm like I want to delete the game But I'm looking I'm looking through it Where is this guy?
[16:15.74]Inside the castle over here or what?
[16:21.50]The cutscenes are good
[16:28.15]There he is.
[16:28.69]Alright.
[16:29.23]I'm in his nest.
[16:30.37]He's feeding his young right now.
[16:33.54]Alright, I'm ready.
[16:34.68]I'm ready to do my first real challenge of one-to-one, hand-to-hand combat.
[16:38.38]And I'm going to probably lose.
[16:39.56]Let's see if I can do it.
[16:42.76]I'm ready to fight you.
[16:43.58]Here we go.
[16:45.37]Here we go.
[16:45.59]Time to fight the guy.
[17:02.31]Alright, pretty good strength immediately.
[17:04.19]Oh, it's kick, there it is.
[17:08.47]Oh, that hurt.
[17:11.71]Alright, gonna back it up.
[17:22.26]Aw, I missed, come on.
[17:23.06]Nice dodge.
[17:32.43]Oh, he's got moves.
[17:33.69]He's got good moves.
[17:34.89]I need to learn those.
[17:40.36]Somebody gave a lot of money, but I have to wait.
[17:41.54]Hold on.
[17:48.20]Oh, right in the gut.
[17:54.29]Way off.
[17:54.93]I just hit you like three times.
[17:57.85]Why would I give up?
[18:05.91]Alright, back it up.
[18:06.99]I don't want to lose.
[18:14.60]Just go.
[18:15.16]Haymakers.
[18:15.68]Haymakers are important.
[18:18.06]Right in the face.
[18:23.84]Come on.
[18:24.16]This guy blocks a lot.
[18:33.39]Damn it, man.
[18:34.15]Come on.
[18:37.59]Just let your guard down for a second.
[18:39.55]Alright, hold on.
[18:44.79]I need stamina.
[18:53.17]What?
[18:53.35]How come I didn't do that to him?
[18:54.89]Oh, I did.
[18:55.88]I did do that to him.
[19:02.84]Oh, what?
[19:04.16]Come on, now.
[19:11.04]Do some elbow drops.
[19:15.20]No, I want to do that to you.
[19:17.50]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[19:19.68]I don't want to lose this.
[19:27.40]Come on.
[19:27.74]What?
[19:27.88]That didn't connect?
[19:28.38]There we go.
[19:35.08]Getting close.
[19:37.89]One more.
[19:38.63]Oh, there he goes!
[19:39.43]See you later.
[19:40.53]Give me all his stuff, quick.
[19:42.19]Take everything.
[19:46.63]I just, like, Jerma suplexed him on his head.
[19:52.79]More fights, you won.
[19:56.16]Did I make any money from this?
[19:57.40]I guess I did from taking it from him.
[20:02.58]Do I still have him?
[20:04.48]Oh, no, I don't.
[20:06.02]Should I kill him?
[20:08.35]Should I, like, just stick a knife in the back of this guy's head?
[20:14.99]Well, I took a... Is he going to be with no clothes the rest of the game?
[20:20.03]Let me see here.
[20:20.41]What do we got?
[20:24.19]Yeah, some of this stuff is... Oh, it's all stolen.
[20:27.57]So from my understanding, you can't sell stolen shit, right?
[20:32.23]What am I supposed to do with it?
[20:35.68]What is the best defense?
[20:42.25]Nothing?
[20:43.73]Nothing is more than one defense?
[20:44.93]I have four coifs.
[20:47.37]Yeah, well, I've been doing a lot of stealing.
[20:50.79]Give it back.
[20:51.43]No.
[20:53.26]He's not getting it back.
[20:55.42]Well, this is 68.
[21:00.10]These things are worth $350, but I can't do anything about it.
[21:04.53]These are better.
[21:06.03]Pointed green hat.
[21:07.13]There we go.
[21:07.67]Look, I'm just pretending to be him now.
[21:11.88]Zero.
[21:13.08]Yeah, zero.
[21:16.30]Tight.
[21:17.49]Tight red hose.
[21:19.53]Those look green to me.
[21:24.09]Working boots.
[21:27.51]Yellow shirt.
[21:30.25]I stole this from some lady's house.
[21:33.98]Just trying to make sure I knew how the game worked.
[21:36.04]What's equipped right now?
[21:38.04]Alright, that's fine.
[21:40.54]Am I hungry yet?
[21:41.91]No, I'm good.
[21:45.40]Oh, he's getting up.
[21:48.04]I'm you.
[21:48.28]Did you figure it out?
[21:55.84]Should I talk to him?
[21:59.31]Hey, how you doing?
[22:00.85]Let's fight.
[22:01.45]Should I fight him with his own clothes on?
[22:03.01]I hope you've got coin this time.
[22:04.87]I won't fight you for your labor, understand?
[22:08.17]Wait, no, hold on.
[22:09.27]You can't fight just now.
[22:11.18]Okay, I got a new level to do.
[22:13.88]Like, I don't want to kill this guy.
[22:16.30]But... I wish it... That would be so funny if he was just like, Where'd you get those clothes?
[22:27.88]Alright, let's... That was a little side mission.
[22:34.22]Just to get us started here.
[22:36.87]Now... I can't get over that.
[22:41.06]That upside-down pretzel, man.
[22:42.48]Like, that's the biggest bug in the whole game.
[22:47.20]Universally, that's not a... That's an upside-down pretzel.
[22:53.32]Nothing else is like that.
[22:54.26]I mean, they have a balloon.
[22:59.46]I can go to, like, the clown shop and get, like, balloon animals made.
[23:03.86]That's not a pretzel?
[23:04.76]What is that, then?
[23:05.39]What do you mean that's not a pretzel?
[23:10.67]That's a pretzel!
[23:13.13]You show that to anybody, just like flash that on the screen and be like, what was that thing in the middle?
[23:20.19]That's actually how they're made?
[23:21.25]No way.
[23:22.18]I don't believe it.
[23:24.52]Alright, let's just go.
[23:27.40]I could do the combat training, but I need to like get some shit.
[23:31.94]Is this gonna hold on?
[23:33.94]Am I gonna get like a weapon from this or something?
[23:36.97]Let me do this.
[23:38.27]I feel like this is gonna get me a weapon.
[23:43.31]A foe.
[23:46.56]A foe?
[23:47.26]What is this?
[23:47.66]Final Fantasy?
[23:49.28]This is random encounters.
[23:51.28]Fight or flee?
[23:52.20]What do you mean foe?
[23:58.26]When guards challenge you to surrender, you can do so, but... What did I do?
[24:03.68]What the fuck is going on?
[24:05.90]What, you can do so?
[24:09.66]What happened?
[24:15.70]Why did I... What?
[24:22.87]Wait, you want 60 bucks?
[24:25.65]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[24:26.53]Because I stole off of their dead bodies.
[24:28.83]I'm wearing stolen shit.
[24:30.11]Well, who cares?
[24:30.79]How would they even know that?
[24:31.81]We're all wearing the same green and red clothes.
[24:35.15]Alright, let's see if I can... I can pull the secret agent on him.
[24:38.80]You're making a serious mistake.
[24:40.82]If only you knew what you just got yourself into.
[24:43.66]This won't end well for you.
[24:46.09]I'm part of the secret CIA mission?
[24:49.07]That's so funny.
[24:55.05]I'm a secret agent.
[24:58.98]I don't... I don't... I just... I took so long to make that money.
[25:03.36]Flee?
[25:07.60]Should I just go to jail?
[25:10.33]I'm gonna go to jail.
[25:13.03]Is this fucking shield talking, or what is going on here?
[25:17.71]I don't wanna go to- no, no, no, no, no.
[25:18.89]I'm not- they can take all my stuff.
[25:25.88]I'm getting out of here!
[25:35.62]Where's the nearest trolley?
[25:41.42]Oh, get out of the way.
[25:51.65]Wait, I surrender.
[25:52.63]I surrender.
[25:53.19]I surrender.
[25:53.63]I surrender.
[25:54.45]I surrender.
[26:00.92]Got you.
[26:01.96]Now I'll fix you good and proper.
[26:04.24]You'll soon learn what justice means.
[26:07.33]His hat's on backwards.
[26:09.43]I don't think his hat's on right.
[26:10.89]It means nothing to you, really.
[26:14.33]Well, the law takes a different view.
[26:16.33]I should have thought twice about what you're doing.
[26:18.34]That will land you a fat fine.
[26:23.73]Wait, let's try.
[26:25.07]Hold on.
[26:25.53]This is a different guard.
[26:27.23]So, hey, I'm a fucking secret agent.
[26:31.33]Look, I'll tell you a truth.
[26:32.44]You mustn't tell anyone.
[26:34.32]The Lord of Rat Eyes sent me on a secret mission.
[26:37.30]To do it, I have to bend the law a little bit.
[26:39.96]One of these idiots is going to believe me.
[26:42.57]My heart bleeds for you.
[26:51.26]Alright, we gotta get another guard.
[26:52.12]I gotta find one more guard.
[26:54.17]Alright.
[26:57.97]Next one.
[26:58.59]Yep.
[26:58.77]Yep, I'm gonna learn what justice means.
[27:08.73]You look surprised.
[27:10.51]I've got plenty on you.
[27:12.48]You scum.
[27:13.82]It's not the same guy.
[27:15.16]That guy doesn't have a mustache.
[27:16.48]Not to mention other troublemaking.
[27:18.38]So keep your mouth shut.
[27:19.94]Okay.
[27:20.24]This definitely won't come cheap.
[27:22.84]You'll learn.
[27:24.48]Crime doesn't pay.
[27:25.88]Crime doesn't pay, but what you don't understand is I'm on a secret mission.
[27:29.61]Look, I'll tell you the truth, but you mustn't tell anyone.
[27:32.61]The Lord of Rat Eye sent me on a secret mission.
[27:35.63]To do it, I have to bend the law a little now.
[27:37.89]Understand?
[27:39.47]Do you think I'm so stupid as to fall for such a thing?
[27:43.63]Same guy.
[27:43.97]Look, okay.
[27:44.17]Look, look, look.
[27:45.19]I'm going to jail.
[27:47.33]Not much.
[27:47.82]I don't have enough on me.
[27:49.68]You still owe me a penalty.
[27:52.42]Looks like you'll have to sit it out in jail.
[27:54.70]Oh, yeah?
[28:02.12]Come on, there's got to be one guy I can convince, right?
[28:04.38]Okay, okay.
[28:07.52]New guy.
[28:08.56]Shit.
[28:08.72]I keep running and stopping.
[28:12.14]Listen.
[28:13.74]Oh, God.
[28:14.14]Three and 14.
[28:14.38]I can't.
[28:14.82]Oh.
[28:28.95]You're making a serious mistake.
[28:30.99]If only you knew what you just got yourself into.
[28:33.85]This won't end well for you.
[28:35.39]My heart bleeds.
[28:37.60]Alright, I'm done.
[28:38.28]I'm going to jail.
[28:39.82]I'm going to fucking jail.
[28:40.94]Finally.
[28:41.42]I don't have that much money.
[28:42.44]I give up.
[28:43.14]You don't pay?
[28:43.94]The charisma check.
[28:44.84]He's on every single thing.
[28:46.62]He's at least ten higher than me.
[28:49.32]I'm going to jail.
[28:51.68]Get moving.
[28:54.24]Yeah, okay, take my Robin Hood helmet.
[29:00.59]I don't give a shit.
[29:01.59]Ten days, that's it?
[29:03.43]Wow.
[29:05.65]That's not a big deal at all.
[29:14.33]We actually have to sit here, though.
[29:18.02]That's the max?
[29:19.06]What?
[29:19.38]Because I stole somebody's hat and I punched a guy.
[29:22.34]I get the maximum amount of jail time.
[29:28.80]Can I skip this?
[29:30.64]No, I think we have to watch this.
[29:31.76]Alright, seven.
[29:34.12]That's it.
[29:36.04]I'm getting out early.
[29:39.12]Yeah, I get to get out early.
[29:41.12]Because I've had really good behavior.
[29:43.14]I robbed so many people.
[29:49.12]Do we actually have to sit here?
[29:50.26]Etalyx killed like 30 people and got a $200 fine.
[30:00.41]Why is it going slower?
[30:03.23]What the fuck is going on?
[30:05.25]It's showing me a loading screen.
[30:14.25]It really is slowing down.
[30:21.19]Don't be tabbed.
[30:21.91]I'm not tabbed out.
[30:22.93]I'm tabbed in.
[30:23.59]Look at my mouse.
[30:28.87]I'm gonna laugh so hard if it goes even slower at five days.
[30:31.20]Has it been a full day?
[30:44.76]We're still on six days.
[30:47.82]Guys, this has been a full day already.
[30:54.55]It's been a full day.
[31:02.70]Day six is the longest, apparently.
[31:07.86]Oh, there we go.
[31:08.62]Okay.
[31:13.10]Alright.
[31:13.36]Well, in the meantime, we had... Oh, I can't tab out what somebody said.
[31:16.51]Oh, it's alright.
[31:16.97]I got it.
[31:19.31]Uh, uh, official, official Wang gave $50 here.
[31:22.27]Thank you so much, dude, for the $50 donation.
[31:26.34]A little gift from me to you.
[31:27.48]Thanks for being one of the most honest, hilarious, and overall entertaining people, overall entertainers I've ever watched.
[31:33.06]I've been watching you since the early days and never been disappointed in your content.
[31:37.32]You're one of the people on my bucket list that I want to meet, however hard that may be with my living in England.
[31:42.96]Cheers, Jeremy boy.
[31:45.50]Thank you, official Wang.
[31:48.31]Um, actually I want to travel to Europe.
[31:50.56]How long is this going to take?
[31:53.94]No, no, no.
[31:54.24]This is a pay attention stream.
[31:56.72]Um, I, I do want to travel to Europe eventually here.
[32:02.49]You're talking about like bucket list stuff for me.
[32:05.07]I want to go to, uh, I want to go to London.
[32:09.25]I want to go to France and you know, there, there are my underpants.
[32:13.68]You know what I'm saying?
[32:17.83]Tokyo is on there too.
[32:21.88]And after that, you know, that's kind of the bucket list of places I'd like to go.
[32:26.40]Europe, Japan.
[32:27.46]See you in five days.
[32:32.84]Does this actually take this long?
[32:39.13]Or do I just have a bugged game right now that decides it's going to take... This is going to be probably five to ten full minutes.
[32:52.49]Well, it's alright.
[32:55.09]Good enough time for me to read bits?
[32:57.69]Thanks though, Official Wang.
[32:59.39]Hopefully I meet you sometime in the future.
[33:03.20]That would be interesting.
[33:03.92]Maybe like a convention in Europe or something I would try to get to.
[33:08.76]Thank you so much, dude.
[33:10.62]Comcast, customer care, thanks for the $1.
[33:12.22]I love last stream because it created my new favorite Jerma quote, that pig has lots of boobs.
[33:16.12]That's the type of content bar that I was at last night.
[33:20.16]That's not good.
[33:23.26]It slowed down because you tabbed out.
[33:25.30]But what if I tabbed back?
[33:26.36]I'm like tabbed back in.
[33:32.93]Man, I'm getting hungry.
[33:37.45]Thank you, Abdomality, for the $15.
[33:39.01]Oh yeah, Castle Griffin State Origins.
[33:42.05]I love this game.
[33:44.65]Thanks, dude.
[33:46.98]This is kind of unbelievable, though.
[33:52.82]This is actually unbelievable.
[33:57.26]I could have taken a pee break and been back by now.
[34:00.44]What happens if I hit escape?
[34:09.51]Just don't break the laws.
[34:10.95]How did I break it?
[34:17.36]I didn't do anything.
[34:23.97]The game's currently calculating your punishment.
[34:29.80]I don't even want to commit a crime now.
[34:32.72]Do you lose all your money if you go to jail?
[34:38.30]So I lose all my money, all my stuff, and the game takes like 10 minutes to load the next sequence.
[34:47.13]They just said someone watched you stealing.
[34:48.73]Yeah, well...
[34:51.05]What about the people that murder people in this game and they get a day in prison?
[34:58.67]The guy you stole from was a witness.
[34:59.89]Alright, so what you're telling me is just get rid of the witnesses.
[35:03.21]We're almost done.
[35:04.26]Alright, how funny would this be if it got to zero and then it went back to ten?
[35:27.62]Only one more day.
[35:28.32]Here it comes.
[35:29.00]Get her to get the countdown ready.
[35:32.60]Hey, Moo means Moo.
[35:33.32]Thanks for the one dollar.
[35:34.04]Dermot's finally serving his time for the... For the of, comma, he skipped past the trial.
[35:42.77]For the OF.
[35:44.29]The offense?
[35:46.23]I guess?
[35:48.89]Thanks you.
[35:49.61]Thanks you.
[35:51.65]Now, thank you to Chojiboy for the $5.
[35:53.01]Hey, Dermot, I just want to point out something.
[35:54.63]You probably started this donation out with- by saying thanks for the five bucks despite me paying $10 for the bits.
[36:00.40]I buy bits on mobile, so I don't know if the prices are inflated on here or whatever.
[36:04.24]But I first noticed it when I paid $50 for bits and you said thanks for the 27-something dollars.
[36:11.71]Really?
[36:12.11]Wait, that's- that doesn't seem right.
[36:16.13]That seems complet- well, thanks- first of all, Choji, thanks for the- that doesn't seem right at all.
[36:21.68]Okay, I thought it went to 24 days.
[36:23.07]I thought that said 24 days.
[36:26.31]Alright, come on, 22.
[36:27.29]21.
[36:27.31]20.
[36:27.33]19.
[36:27.85]Twitch is taking a big cut.
[36:48.38]I'm doing an illegal meme right now.
[36:49.78]That's right.
[36:50.34]Well, no, I'm doing a backwards illegal meme.
[36:52.16]That doesn't count.
[37:07.97]Okay, here we go.
[37:09.84]Right when the hand... Right when it gets to the little hand.
[37:13.76]AmClockwork, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[37:15.24]I've enjoyed everything you put out since you've recorded videos with Ster and TF2.
[37:18.96]Easily one of the funniest people I've ever seen.
[37:20.73]Thanks for being such a hardworking dude.
[37:22.11]Thank you, AmClock.
[37:23.17]Appreciate it.
[37:24.31]Thank you so much.
[37:24.95]Here we go.
[37:28.19]One hour.
[37:29.57]And... Out of jail.
[37:42.34]Out of jail.
[37:53.65]Look at it, it's really, it's slowly going.
[37:55.59]Do you see it?
[37:56.77]Look at the top.
[37:58.59]It's going at a snail's pace, but it's going.
[38:01.81]Almost there.
[38:03.53]Oh god, this is like pulling a bandaid off.
[38:07.47]Come on.
[38:08.35]Pull it off.
[38:10.21]Pull off the bandaid.
[38:12.33]It's right there.
[38:14.89]Do it.
[38:19.29]Come on.
[38:22.11]And
[38:29.23]There it is.
[38:30.87]You have served your... Nice, I'm done.
[38:32.85]No!
[38:40.10]Wait, wait, no.
[38:42.04]No, no, no, no.
[38:46.78]No, I had to.
[38:48.40]I had to.
[38:50.28]This definitely won't come cheap.
[38:52.62]You'll learn crime doesn't pay.
[38:55.89]Wait, this guy's an idiot.
[38:59.07]You're making a serious mistake.
[39:01.11]If only you knew what you just got yourself into.
[39:03.97]This won't end well for you.
[39:06.05]Alright, I know.
[39:09.15]I'm gonna go back.
[39:10.91]I'm gonna go back.
[39:11.53]We're gonna save scum.
[39:13.79]Oh my god, that's so much money.
[39:15.57]I'm gonna save scum.
[39:17.19]That was not worth it.
[39:18.19]Load game.
[39:19.25]I don't know what I...
[39:25.23]Oh, that... I ha... I just... Yeah.
[39:31.02]I don't even know which one this is.
[39:32.40]I don't know.
[39:33.32]This is flipping a coin.
[39:43.40]Two?
[39:44.82]Is it two?
[39:47.31]Oh, okay.
[39:50.01]Wait.
[39:51.87]Alright, it's 1720... 2202.
[39:58.11]What happened here?
[39:59.89]Was this what I just did?
[40:05.83]I think it's this one right here.
[40:11.07]Secrets task.
[40:18.40]I think it's this one.
[40:22.00]That was yesterday.
[40:27.32]No, it wasn't.
[40:32.54]Oh no, don't.
[40:33.62]Really?
[40:35.66]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:37.11]Alright, this is the only time we're going to fuck around the whole game.
[40:42.37]I promise.
[40:42.75]We're on the 26th.
[40:43.35]Okay, just... I don't have any money.
[40:55.10]No secret missions.
[40:57.09]It's alright.
[40:57.49]I was just fighting.
[40:58.45]It's gonna be... It's gonna be one day.
[41:01.85]Agree with imprisonment.
[41:02.91]I can't do it.
[41:04.79]I leveled up.
[41:05.35]See?
[41:05.97]Okay.
[41:09.19]What is it?
[41:10.70]Okay.
[41:11.04]There we go.
[41:11.62]I'm not touching a damn thing.
[41:13.34]Ten days in jail.
[41:48.81]I ain't touching anything, man.
[41:51.09]It's not getting slower.
[41:52.13]It's going exactly the same.
[41:56.79]Imagine getting out of jail and going right back in.
[41:59.99]You just get out and you push the guy that's the guard and you're like, fuck you, I'm on a secret mission.
[42:09.99]Alt-Tab, nope.
[42:16.41]He's been in jail for almost a month.
[42:18.37]What you don't understand is I'm on a fucking mission from the governor.
[42:26.96]Alright, how much for me to punch him again?
[42:32.23]Should I get out and punch him again?
[42:34.67]Can I actually just get to the end of the game by being in jail forever?
[42:37.37]I'm all dead.
[42:43.92]I'm not gonna do it again.
[42:44.96]I promise.
[42:50.06]See, this is so much better.
[42:51.62]24 hours.
[42:59.74]I don't care.
[43:00.12]No, no one's giving up.
[43:01.78]It's done.
[43:02.16]It's over.
[43:02.50]We're already going to be out.
[43:04.86]It's going to cost you my viewing the stream.
[43:08.81]We're done.
[43:10.35]That's it.
[43:16.69]Let's go train.
[43:19.31]See, there's not even a guy here for me to punch.
[43:20.56]That guy got fired already.
[43:27.30]That guy doesn't even work here anymore.
[43:28.74]It's been a month, guys.
[43:30.52]That guy went on a... That was just a temporary job for that guy.
[43:34.38]Do I have to check out?
[43:35.92]What happens when you get out of jail?
[43:36.82]You have to check out, right?
[43:37.70]Like a doctor?
[43:43.72]No checkout, okay.
[43:48.18]What's on my... What do I have on me?
[43:49.98]I have like a ball and chain on me?
[43:51.50]Alright, let's do the training.
[43:58.31]Armor.
[43:58.69]I got... What happened to all my stuff?
[44:00.99]No, this is a dirty shirt.
[44:05.29]Put it on the plate.
[44:05.91]Make sure that's on.
[44:06.61]Yep.
[44:09.95]Take off this... I guess I have to wear it.
[44:13.46]Can I wear... I can't wear the dress?
[44:16.98]Uh, is it... Does it make anybody else nervous that all of the stuff I had was stolen?
[44:20.58]Alright, at least they didn't take my food.
[44:24.56]Okay.
[44:24.72]Okay.
[44:26.02]Let's go.
[44:26.40]I might need to sleep.
[44:28.80]I'd love to get something to eat.
[44:30.89]You got a stew in here?
[44:32.61]Everybody has soup in their house, right?
[44:58.01]Fucking suckers.
[45:06.61]No evidence.
[45:08.33]I'm hungry, huh?
[45:09.17]Just eat all the stolen shit.
[45:11.65]What else you got in here?
[45:13.07]Horseradish?
[45:13.91]Eat it.
[45:17.39]Salt?
[45:17.89]Eat it.
[45:19.55]No, drop that here.
[45:22.41]Drop this.
[45:24.12]Wine?
[45:24.42]Drink it.
[45:29.45]Okay.
[45:30.11]The evidence doesn't exist anymore and I'm not hungry now.
[45:33.43]I'll call up against to act gradually, giving you bonus on speech, vitality, charisma, and strength.
[45:36.68]Although if you overindulge, the after effects can be less than pleasant.
[45:39.76]Okay.
[45:42.52]Let's go do the mission.
[45:45.68]If I burp in this guy's face, is he going to know it's stolen wine?
[45:49.19]Boy, that smells just like the cellar wine.
[45:53.03]You're in deep shit.
[46:00.38]Just like real alcohol.
[46:02.28]Oh, I can fast travel there, right?
[46:05.04]Did I sleep?
[46:08.64]Yeah, I did.
[46:12.58]No, I'm not punching anybody.
[46:14.10]I'm not hurting a goddamn person.
[46:17.18]That's a beautiful scene.
[46:19.78]Kingdom Come Deliverance.
[46:21.38]Stunningly beautiful.
[46:23.00]Stunning.
[46:26.90]There's no little splash there?
[46:28.02]Hmm.
[46:30.89]What T-Rex made that footprint?
[46:34.93]How soon till he goes to jail?
[46:35.95]I'm not doing that again.
[46:37.25]We're going to go learn how to wield a sword from the Master-at-Arms.
[46:44.09]Where is he?
[46:47.43]How do I open up the... Certain time.
[46:52.22]Go to the training ground and talk to Captain Bernard.
[46:56.62]Is he not out here because it's raining?
[47:02.15]Where's the captain?
[47:02.75]Captain, it's just a little bit of rain.
[47:04.89]Alright, let's wait an hour.
[47:20.37]It took you 20 days to get here.
[47:22.81]Hey, it's me!
[47:23.49]Hi, captain.
[47:27.07]Holy shit, what took you a month?
[47:31.33]I'm here for training.
[47:34.59]What am I covered in?
[47:38.39]That'll be me.
[47:38.99]Yes, that's me.
[47:41.21]Let's get to it then.
[47:42.67]That's what Sir Razzic wishes.
[47:44.59]Get some basic training.
[47:46.09]Because you've never held a sword in your hand before, we'll start with something simple.
[47:54.78]Very well.
[47:56.46]I look like dog shit.
[47:58.38]Oh, come on, I was just in prison for a month.
[48:04.46]Well, let's see what you're made of.
[48:05.84]Hold it properly.
[48:07.20]Keep moving.
[48:08.16]Never stand still when your life depends on it.
[48:10.36]Yeah.
[48:13.82]Can unlock by holding B. Yep.
[48:17.92]I understand.
[48:19.18]Now, try attacking.
[48:20.08]Didn't I already do this?
[48:20.60]You've got to put your back into a good slash.
[48:23.20]No use waving the sword around like you're swatting flies.
[48:27.87]Your whole body.
[48:34.47]Choose the direction.
[48:35.53]Yes.
[48:45.37]I do do the uppercuts.
[48:46.60]This is just making sure I know what I'm doing, right?
[48:48.18]I did this already.
[48:57.38]I can be aimed at the face.
[48:57.94]Yep.
[48:59.48]Thank you, Captain Bernard.
[49:00.94]We already did this.
[49:01.52]Strike, strike, strike.
[49:23.95]Okay, yeah.
[49:24.73]Right, right, right.
[49:32.60]Right, right, right.
[49:37.62]Alright.
[49:38.34]Now try to kill me.
[49:39.10]Yep.
[49:39.18]Oh, that'll be the block and you gotta hold in the right direction.
[49:42.20]Yeah, when he goes up and down like that.
[49:44.41]Uh-huh.
[49:58.49]Lower left.
[49:59.03]Oh, no, top.
[49:59.71]Yeah, got it.
[50:08.96]Yeah, okay.
[50:09.96]He's still on the tutorial?
[50:11.24]Yeah, the first 10 hours of this game is a tutorial.
[50:16.62]Let's pretend fighting, it's okay.
[50:29.95]Ooh, that was a nice little combination.
[50:33.38]Holy shit, dude.
[50:41.00]He's way better than me.
[50:41.76]He has, like, cool combos.
[50:54.25]My character's so slow.
[50:55.47]This is like a little wooden sword.
[51:05.77]Jesus.
[51:12.70]Am I even hurting this guy?
[51:17.15]Fine, enough.
[51:19.02]You're not a complete dead loss.
[51:24.10]Let's try something more advanced.
[51:26.16]When in combat, keep an eye on the space between you and your opponent.
[51:29.67]That is your space.
[51:30.69]If you get drunk, your animations or conversation change.
[51:34.49]If I'm holding the sword raised up, do an uppercut.
[51:37.71]My sword is low.
[51:39.73]Let's try it.
[51:40.33]You strike a few times at the side where I'm not holding my sword.
[51:42.89]Sure.
[51:44.53]Not bad.
[51:51.32]Yeah, well, he's holding it up.
[51:52.50]What?
[51:52.82]Why is that?
[51:53.96]Everything you've ever done is wrong.
[51:56.62]Okay.
[51:56.84]Okay, so he's doing a parry.
[52:20.30]Uh, to fully deflect the attack, you need to time your block with the enemy strike.
[52:24.52]Okay, wait.
[52:24.90]Right when he starts the attack.
[52:26.27]Okay.
[52:26.41]There's a little thing in the middle.
[52:28.59]Okay.
[52:56.27]Oh, it was good, apparently.
[53:07.92]Ow.
[53:08.08]I'm, like, hurting my hands.
[53:10.22]Ow.
[53:13.42]Ow.
[53:13.84]Ow.
[53:14.70]Thank you.
[53:32.24]Wait, I thought he said he was going to do it fast.
[53:36.08]I'm going to do it way faster this time, except actually, no, I'm not.
[53:52.09]Why can't I... Are there batting gloves I can put on to make this not hurt?
[53:58.36]Good, good.
[53:59.52]Now let's try it at full speed.
[54:01.32]You probably won't
[54:02.56]You probably won't do it.
[54:04.10]Okay.
[54:09.78]Oh, I see.
[54:19.42]That is quick.
[54:23.24]You must train!
[54:32.82]We can yell that right now.
[54:34.02]Wait a while, Henry.
[54:38.42]Okay.
[54:39.74]That's it?
[54:42.18]Wait a while.
[54:43.78]I was on my way when I noticed that you're entertaining Saradzig's... You should have farmed the bugged AI.
[54:49.30]...holding a hammer, is it?
[54:51.86]Blacksmith.
[54:52.94]It's Saradzig's orders.
[54:54.97]Slit throat.
[54:56.31]I'm actually here to train at the archery range.
[54:58.87]My hand has grown heavy lately...
[55:01.66]You're gonna teach me how to shoot a bow?
[55:05.26]Oi!
[55:08.22]I'm not a boy!
[55:12.86]Wait, you can sl- you can- okay, I just... I almost just slashed that guy.
[55:20.96]Alright, this is what I wanted to learn.
[55:25.22]I wanted to learn how to do the sidestep, that.
[55:33.41]What the fuck?
[55:35.37]What's going on?
[55:36.57]Can I only slash?
[55:37.45]I can't stab right now?
[55:39.43]Oh boy.
[55:42.77]Gotta be perfect.
[55:44.14]You actually just move left and right.
[56:06.17]Oh, it's just a tap.
[56:08.25]Okay.
[56:12.43]Well done.
[56:14.55]Fine.
[56:17.25]Yeah, he's making it real easy.
[56:19.65]That counts.
[56:37.61]Now, that's not going to pop up on the screen every time, is it?
[56:39.95]And the last thing for today, a trick.
[56:43.13]You raise the sword to force your opponent to block.
[56:45.61]But then, change the direction of the attack at the last moment, and the opponent won't even know what hit him.
[56:51.01]Try it.
[56:51.73]Draw back the weapon, then change the attack zone and strike.
[56:54.66]So I don't have time to react.
[56:57.20]Prepare the attack by holding right trigger and then change the zone.
[57:02.18]No!
[57:02.80]Again!
[57:03.08]No!
[57:03.18]No!
[57:08.29]okay so I'm gonna hit you at the top I'm gonna hit you at the top no I'm not oh you gotta let go okay here it comes just kidding well done at the bottom a that makes this so much easier knowing these things seriously well now that wasn't too bad maybe it will make a soldier of you after all don't get cocky
[57:36.53]You have to train hard and persistently.
[57:39.41]You might have talent, but talent alone won't do.
[57:42.41]Thank you, Bernard.
[57:43.49]Is he alright?
[57:48.22]Don't leave yet.
[57:49.32]Sir Radzig also wanted me to teach you archery.
[57:51.82]Come with me.
[57:54.44]From now on, you can come to the arena in time and challenge the master to a training duel.
[57:58.78]Oh god, I'm so excited.
[57:59.60]I can't wait.
[58:00.70]I just love archery.
[58:01.74]Oh my god, this is so exciting for me.
[58:04.43]Do you think, do you think, do you think I'm gonna be one of the best?
[58:06.95]Do you think I'm gonna be the best?
[58:08.35]What do you think?
[58:08.73]Do you think I'm gonna be one of the best actors?
[58:11.62]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, hurry.
[58:16.20]I'm so excited.
[58:17.14]Ooh, zoom!
[58:20.51]See how fast I went?
[58:22.29]Did you see, hey, did you see how fast I went?
[58:24.01]Watch, I took it.
[58:25.49]Zoom!
[58:33.42]As you can tell, I have nieces and nephews, as you can tell.
[58:43.79]Punch.
[58:44.28]No.
[58:49.68]Where's the archery range?
[58:50.60]And why are we taking this long?
[58:51.60]Can't we just get in the car?
[59:08.14]God damn it, I was trying to push him off.
[59:11.90]What?
[59:12.90]What's going on?
[59:15.62]What's going on?
[59:17.44]Don't bother me with this shit.
[59:18.50]What do you mean, search me?
[59:21.88]I'm currently on a... For security reasons.
[59:25.86]What are they searching me for?
[59:26.72]What?
[59:31.25]I don't have anything.
[59:35.41]I can't beat him in anything.
[59:38.31]Am I on the, like, watch list now?
[59:47.24]Hey, good thing I threw away all the stolen stuff.
[59:55.58]Now, where did he go?
[59:59.70]Where did he go?
[60:03.67]Imagine if I still had a wheel of stolen cheese on me.
[60:10.51]That would be so bad if we go back to jail for 10 days.
[60:16.73]I wish that kind of happened.
[60:21.22]It looked like a trash can.
[60:24.36]Thank you.
[60:38.02]Well, I don't have any money.
[60:40.77]I need to buy stuff.
[60:41.77]Draw your bow.
[60:42.85]Hold right trigger to load the arrow.
[60:44.41]I mean, that guy's there for you to do that, right?
[60:46.19]Like, this guy's here because it's... Why would they put him there?
[61:13.72]You can start shooting and save your arrow.
[61:15.46]Okay, you can abort.
[61:16.48]Okay, so there's this drop.
[61:17.54]Okay.
[61:17.80]Oh, I want to shoot.
[61:18.68]Okay.
[61:41.83]No.
[61:42.75]That's the thing that everyone thinks I'm going to do.
[61:44.89]I'm not going to do it.
[61:47.45]Everybody knows that's the thing I'm going to do.
[61:50.57]He's going to turn around and shoot the guy in the head.
[61:52.83]I'm not going to do it.
[61:58.27]We were just in jail.
[61:59.73]That was awful.
[62:02.11]I didn't imagine a village yokel like you would have much skill, but you failed to meet even my low expectations.
[62:07.89]I don't know why you're wasting your time, Sivanoff.
[62:11.16]Nothing will come of him anyway.
[62:12.86]Fuck this little snooty guy.
[62:14.64]After all, he's done it before.
[62:18.80]What did you say?
[62:20.68]Calm down, boy.
[62:21.58]Keep in mind who you're talking to.
[62:23.52]A brother who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
[62:26.82]You've really done it you'll go to the stocks for that what?
[62:31.99]If the blacksmith boy feels he can prove himself What why is everybody hate me?
[62:38.01]Well any time?
[62:40.93]Very well if you defeat me.
[62:43.67]Oh come on.
[62:44.17]I just I just learned how to do this.
[62:45.83]You'll have to pay up Do you even have any coin I have enough I?
[62:52.36]I just learned how to do this.
[62:54.31]Okay, fine.
[62:55.09]Compete with hands.
[62:56.89]In an archery competition.
[62:58.91]Are we starting now?
[62:59.59]You can't even do it.
[63:06.14]You actually can't even do it.
[63:10.20]I shot the guy right in the back and didn't do anything.
[63:11.92]Can't even do it.
[63:13.79]I'm fucking gonna...
[63:26.88]What?
[63:27.60]Take the... I'm using the mouse for this.
[63:34.04]Yeah, why am I using the controller for this?
[63:42.17]Like, the controller is so bad with this.
[63:54.74]Well, I didn't expect that.
[63:57.75]Probably just wasn't your day, sir.
[63:59.77]I told you I have a heavy hand.
[64:02.03]Ever since I fell off that horse during the last hunt.
[64:04.53]What are you grinning about, boy?
[64:06.81]I think you owe me a little pain.
[64:09.12]How about a sword fight at the arena?
[64:11.12]If you like.
[64:13.50]I didn't expect him to win.
[64:14.74]Yeah, this guy makes more excuses than I do.
[64:16.22]Huh?
[64:16.46]What are you talking about?
[64:17.60]I have to fight him with a sword now?
[64:19.54]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[64:20.90]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[64:22.56]What the fuck are we doing?
[64:44.69]I'm gonna- I'm gonna- Am I gonna kill this guy?
[64:49.10]Alright, use my training!
[65:01.84]Shit.
[65:10.75]Went the wrong way.
[65:21.67]Oh, bugger!
[65:40.59]Ooh, right in the chest!
[65:42.17]Right in your chest!
[65:42.99]That's the worst place to get stabbed, for sure.
[65:46.37]Forget about vital organs.
[65:53.90]Shit, out of stamina.
[66:09.25]Get outta here.
[66:11.29]You suck, Han Solo.
[66:12.63]Your movie's gonna suck.
[66:14.16]Not even a fucking good wig.
[66:15.48]10,000 upvotes!
[66:19.83]Don't worry your mangy head about me, peasant.
[66:22.87]We'll see each other again soon enough.
[66:25.29]You can keep my bow.
[66:26.65]His best years are behind it anyway.
[66:34.60]That was fun.
[66:37.38]Hmm, kicked that guy's ass.
[66:38.32]What do you think about that, Bernard?
[66:40.20]Huh?
[66:43.44]Hmm.
[66:44.36]You better hope his lordship hasn't taken it badly.
[66:48.21]I'm just a commoner.
[66:50.80]He shouldn't have challenged me.
[66:52.50]Save, then kill him.
[66:53.18]Report to the bailiff.
[66:55.50]This is really embarrassing.
[66:57.42]But I have to pee already.
[67:29.61]Fucker.
[67:32.05]He thought I was going to, like, tackle him.
[67:33.69]He thought I was going to just, like, sprint and tackle him, didn't you?
[67:40.93]No.
[67:42.56]Let me just compete.
[67:43.56]I'll be right back.
[67:44.48]Embarrassing piss.

[71:01.14]We're going to fast travel.
[71:02.38]Skip.
[71:08.54]Anybody know if coffee can go bad?
[71:10.04]Does anybody know that?
[71:18.83]Like, if there's a filtered water coffee in the fridge and it's been there for like a week and a half, like two weeks.
[71:25.82]Okay, like, but no, no, no, no milk in there.
[71:28.92]Just black coffee.
[71:31.56]What is this?
[71:32.30]Is this a robot?
[71:34.56]Where am I going?
[71:43.65]Coffee's bad.
[71:44.75]No, it won't go bad.
[71:45.33]Alright, I'm just making sure there's no rotten stuff in the beans.

[71:59.47]Alright, report to the bailiff.
[72:02.65]This is okay.
[72:03.83]I'm trying to report to the bailiff.
[72:34.79]Alright.
[72:35.25]That was not right at all.
[72:36.77]Well, whatever.
[72:37.57]Close the door.
[72:38.07]I was never here.
[72:41.59]What did I just take?
[72:42.23]Got some bandages?
[72:45.74]What am I doing on health?
[72:47.00]I'm alright.
[72:49.38]Doesn't even say it was stolen.
[72:51.48]Dude, that's awesome.
[72:54.10]Untraceable.
[72:56.98]I got untraceable unmarked bills here.
[73:03.57]Vampires, is it better?
[73:07.26]Food, what do I got?
[73:08.00]Am I hungry?
[73:08.48]These are all rotten.
[73:11.16]I'm just going to give this to a dog or something.
[73:14.90]All the rotten bread.
[73:20.42]Just throwing all the food on the ground.
[73:22.90]Alright, dried meat.
[73:25.08]Eat it.
[73:29.31]I can probably cook shit, right?
[73:32.88]Yeah, drop some of that rotten coffee on the ground.
[73:37.73]I do need more food, though.
[73:38.75]Alright, what do we got?
[73:43.95]Time for a bath?
[73:45.37]Not yet.
[73:46.91]Maybe soon.
[73:49.76]Is this private quarters, or is this where I'm supposed to go?
[73:55.22]Private quarters.
[73:57.36]Well, there's a fucking free soup.
[74:06.47]Free soup and more free stuff.
[74:09.99]Nobody asleep up here, right?
[74:10.99]Look at all the free things that are up here.
[74:15.10]Nobody's up here, right?
[74:16.22]Alright.
[74:18.46]Look, if life gives you lemons, squeeze them.
[74:36.82]Damn it.
[74:38.02]It's alright.
[74:40.70]Can I wash myself in there?
[74:48.01]Very hard.
[74:48.65]I don't have a lockpick.
[74:49.35]Alright, where is this guy?
[75:00.33]Where are you?
[75:02.98]Like, report to the bailiff.
[75:05.51]Where is he?
[75:06.97]What house is he in?
[75:09.57]Is there some secret entrance?
[75:11.15]Other side?
[75:11.65]I can't open the barn doors?
[75:20.72]Oh, come on.
[75:21.16]Really?
[75:21.62]Like, there's no way to get over there?
[75:25.38]Lockpicking with a controller is way harder.
[75:27.40]Yeah, I know.
[75:27.82]That's why I'm trying to switch between it.
[75:29.88]I heard it's a nightmare.
[75:32.45]He's in the Bailiff pen.
[75:35.37]Weapons... Alright, like right here?
[75:38.74]Out of the way.
[75:39.16]Alright, I'm here to see the Bailiff.
[75:44.34]Alright, that's not you.
[75:46.12]Uh, is that the Bailiff, Den?
[75:49.14]Alright, I'm here to see the Bailiff.
[75:51.95]No, that's the shield guy.
[75:53.43]Alright, he's right there.
[75:56.77]Is that you?
[75:57.17]Is it sure it's not you?
[75:59.49]Are you sure you're not the Bailiff?
[76:01.51]He's up there.
[76:04.86]What was the last time you took a bailiff test?
[76:11.70]Are you sure it's not you?
[76:17.63]No.
[76:18.07]Nothing I can take.
[76:20.93]There he is.
[76:22.05]Working on his newest novel.
[76:25.21]Hey.
[76:28.09]Huh?
[76:31.33]Huh?
[76:38.86]Master Bailiff, is there anything of interest going on?
[76:42.38]Nothing of interest to me, thank Christ.
[76:49.61]I'm to put myself under the Bailiff's command.
[76:52.48]Just like to round him.
[76:53.74]Yes.
[76:56.28]I need to get better clothes.
[76:57.28]I can't keep walking around.
[76:58.26]He's going to test me.
[76:58.78]I have to learn how to read.
[77:00.04]Oh, OK.
[77:00.56]I have.
[77:27.13]I never broke a sweat.
[77:27.65]Bailiff.
[77:27.89]Kenny will remember that.
[77:28.57]Do I have to be part of the Night's Watch or something?
[77:30.23]I need money, please.
[77:30.75]Bailiff.
[77:54.79]Fifteen... Fifteen coins.
[77:57.97]Bailiff, maybe when you were... Like 20, this would fly.
[78:04.42]Not anymore.
[78:05.60]That's like 500 bucks for a piece of armor.
[78:10.84]I'm sick of this guy's shit.
[78:12.64]Pick up your kit at the armory.
[78:13.97]Join Nightingale on patrol between... Oh man, hold on.
[78:16.15]Now you're giving me tasks.
[78:18.99]Hold on, let me see if I can read that.
[78:24.51]I can't.
[78:25.69]I can't do it.
[78:33.65]No, these are all useless to me.
[78:36.02]Alright, let's move.
[78:38.86]Ask him about learning how to read?
[78:40.00]Who cares?
[78:43.82]I don't need to learn how to read.
[78:44.94]Haven't you ever seen Game of Thrones?
[78:47.00]Does Santa Clegane need to learn how to read?
[78:48.80]No.
[78:51.58]The only guy that's learning how to read in that whole show is Davos.
[78:55.32]And look at how far that got him.
[79:00.82]Guy died in fucking season two.
[79:02.50]Alright, let's see.
[79:07.56]What are we doing?
[79:10.06]This is join the patrol.
[79:12.10]Can do it, or I need to pick up your armor, your kit at the armory.
[79:15.79]We're doing this one first.
[79:17.71]Where's that?
[79:20.22]Seems like it's... I guess we have to go this way.
[79:24.83]Spoilers.
[79:28.17]It's not even... That's not even real!
[79:31.93]That's not a real spoiler!
[79:34.35]That doesn't happen.
[79:35.09]That was a joke.
[79:44.94]It was real.
[79:46.84]Look, there's no... I don't do spoilers, okay?
[79:53.34]If you read this, you're stupid.
[79:55.78]Hey.
[79:56.55]Excuse me.
[79:57.03]Alright, where's my kit?
[80:00.35]Excuse me.
[80:00.91]Where's my kit?
[80:05.31]Excuse me.
[80:06.57]I would like my kit.
[80:09.86]There it is.
[80:10.64]Nope.
[80:11.88]Nope.
[80:13.22]Which one of you guys has it?
[80:16.76]I was told to pick up a kit here.
[80:18.72]Oh, were you?
[80:21.01]Henry.
[80:23.26]And?
[80:24.12]In fealty, too?
[80:25.56]Serraz the cobbler.
[80:26.96]Kai.
[80:27.36]Hmm.
[80:28.79]Yes, I've got you.
[80:30.51]Well, come on in, then.
[80:31.77]Make yourself at home.
[80:33.55]Henry, if my memory serves me, you're entitled to a helmet, a gambeson, and a club.
[80:38.90]Ooh.
[80:39.34]That's all.
[80:41.58]You want a kiss and a hug as well?
[80:43.22]Yes.
[80:43.58]I mean equipment.
[80:45.75]It's quite enough for patrolling the town.
[80:48.64]Stop trouble.
[80:49.68]Oh, this is not going to be good.
[80:52.10]Pick up your kit.
[80:52.84]Okay, thank you.
[80:54.48]Thanks for my... Thanks for my little Timmy gets to pretend to come out with us.
[80:59.78]This is going to be... Okay, you know when they don't cops?
[81:02.48]When the guy that rides along with the cop that pretends like he's a cop.
[81:06.46]Steven Seagal did this.
[81:08.46]He sat in with police officers and pretended to be a police officer.
[81:11.54]He wasn't a police officer.
[81:12.42]He was just a guy.
[81:14.33]It was like Steven Seagal stops crime.
[81:16.11]It was some shitty show on TLC or something.
[81:20.49]Alright, what did I get?
[81:24.33]I got another coif.
[81:26.71]No, I didn't.
[81:27.09]I got this thing.
[81:28.81]So I got a little bit of a... Okay, I got some shoes now.
[81:35.86]Okay.
[81:38.60]I got the foot wraps.
[81:40.20]Those are... They're all the same.
[81:41.66]Doesn't even matter.
[81:42.32]Well, these are 77.
[81:44.59]This is Padded Coif.
[81:45.77]That's a little different.
[81:46.59]That's a little better.
[81:47.21]Alright.
[81:54.48]That looked like shit.
[81:58.40]I have points to put in, though.
[81:59.72]Alright, let's see.
[82:02.93]This is 30% Log Without Food.
[82:05.87]The Manly Odor Nightrider.
[82:10.98]Regenerate brand.
[82:11.79]Penalties on stats falling released from jail are 20% lower.
[82:14.93]We don't need that, right?
[82:15.75]Berga.
[82:17.79]In towns and villages and their immediate vicinity, you have a plus one bonus on strength, agility, vitality, and speech.
[82:25.93]Okay.
[82:26.35]First aid two.
[82:30.30]I'm gonna do this.
[82:31.10]Seems like this is a good idea.
[82:33.18]First aid two.
[82:35.98]Alright.
[82:37.72]I also have strength.
[82:39.48]I can do... I have mule, so I can carry more.
[82:43.53]Gives you a one-third higher chance of overpowering your opponent in a clinch.
[82:51.05]Your stamina regeneration will not slow down in combat.
[82:54.11]Okay, um, yup.
[82:58.04]Oh, we have agility.
[82:59.26]This is feather.
[82:59.96]Fallen will cause you 30% less injury.
[83:01.52]That's the only thing I can do.
[83:05.26]Just take it, why not, right?
[83:07.10]That's pretty cool.
[83:08.88]Speech.
[83:10.45]When a trader loses patience with you during haggling, you can get one more chance to make another offer.
[83:14.97]Increases your speech level by plus three when talking to nobles and wealthy people.
[83:22.38]You can't have the lowborn perk.
[83:27.09]Alright, so this is... I think I'm more of a man of the people, you know what I mean?
[83:31.09]All these highborns, all these... I don't know.
[83:34.57]Actually, wealthy people have more money.
[83:39.73]Yeah.
[83:43.25]I can hang with them, you know what I mean?
[83:46.60]Alright, the rest of this stuff, I can't do anything.
[83:47.92]I think that's it.
[83:51.28]I got the Burgah Boy perk.
[83:54.66]Okay.
[83:56.50]Good.
[83:58.32]As a sound plant.
[83:59.16]Wait, did I even put my weapon on?
[84:00.72]No.
[84:02.77]Okay, I got a bludgeon.
[84:05.27]I already have a bludgeon.
[84:06.41]Get that off.
[84:09.35]I have three of these.
[84:11.09]They're all the same damn thing anyways.
[84:12.47]They're all the same.
[84:14.51]Put on the hunting bow.
[84:16.57]Don't need the torch right now.
[84:17.77]Turn of an arrow.
[84:18.43]It's already there.
[84:19.05]Okay.
[84:23.42]I think I'm ready to protect the piece in my pajamas.
[84:28.18]OY!
[84:34.29]Okay, I can't, um... How do I- is it- why was that in my melee slot?
[84:42.10]Did I- did I not equip it?
[84:43.08]Eh, it's there.
[84:47.84]Oh, there it is.
[84:48.22]Okay, it's left.
[84:49.96]Left pulls out the melee, right pulls out bow.
[84:53.16]Got it.
[84:53.38]Alright, time to keep the peace.
[84:59.79]Get some pants on.
[85:01.47]I don't have time for that right now.
[85:02.47]I need to keep the pace.
[85:07.94]What time is it?
[85:09.02]Is there a clock?
[85:10.00]Who has a clock in the Middle Ages?
[85:11.36]I don't know.
[85:15.28]What do we got?
[85:17.26]How do I just pull up on the controller the quest zone?
[85:22.48]How do I pull up just quests?
[85:25.21]I don't think I can down here.
[85:27.49]No, that's wait.
[85:27.87]Wait.
[85:29.75]Um, well, it's J. Main quest, side quest, I got keeping the peace.
[85:35.08]Join Nightingale and patrol.
[85:36.26]And then to get vengeance.
[85:38.96]Let's do a main quest.
[85:41.40]Let's join the patrol.
[85:51.13]Uh, okay.
[85:52.61]Let's go!
[85:54.65]Look at the sun.
[85:57.28]How am I supposed to know that?
[85:58.42]You can't just look at the sun and tell what time it is.
[86:00.22]The only time you can tell... Okay.
[86:03.32]Hold on, boys and girls.
[86:05.18]I was told by a bunch of people in this chit-chat that I was wrong and the pretzel was actually not upside down.
[86:11.45]But why, then, is this sign right side up?
[86:16.71]Hmm?
[86:20.39]Um... What's going on there?
[86:28.12]See?
[86:30.40]That sign is upside down.
[86:42.24]Signs the wrong way.
[86:43.66]Okay, let's go.
[86:49.61]That means danger.
[86:51.21]You're not a high enough level to come through here.
[86:56.03]I've eaten.
[86:56.99]I'm not hungry.
[87:00.68]There we are.
[87:01.18]Alright.
[87:02.36]I think these are my boys that I need to go with here.
[87:07.00]Not as much as you.
[87:10.89]Yeah.
[87:27.06]Yeah, let's be honest.
[87:28.02]Honesty is the best policy.
[87:29.44]She rescued me.
[87:30.60]She turned up with Captain Robot and is nice.
[87:33.10]All honor to the girl.
[87:34.48]She has bigger balls than most men.
[87:37.00]Tell me, how did you pay her back?
[87:39.76]It tastes better that way if you eat them upside down.
[87:41.44]No, we can't talk about food.
[87:43.68]You should go and see her when you get a chance.
[87:46.06]So how did you end up in the service of the bailiff?
[87:50.54]Uh I want to be useful.
[87:52.00]I don't want to be kicking around in the dirt while other men do honest work-
[87:54.00]We can't talk about food I- I'll- I- I want to stream for like at least five or six hours tonight. I can't talk about food.
[88:01.00]I'm gonna go stuff like spinach in my mouth up there Popeye style in about 20 minutes. Don't forget, I'm supposed to try you out and with the help of god teach you something.
[88:06.00]Don't forget, I'm supposed to try you out and with the help of god teach you something. So I expect you to deal with any misconduct yourself.
[88:13.00]Oh no.
[88:15.00]I'll make sure you don't do anything too stupid, let's go.
[88:20.91]Alright let's do it.
[88:22.91]If you must follow somebody slow down to a walk that way you want to alert your quarry and you can enjoy a pleasant stroll.
[88:29.00]Let's turn the game up a little bit.
[88:36.00]Is that better? Louder? We good it?
[88:42.00]It serves not only as the house of god but as the crypt of the lords of lipa, our masters.
[88:50.58]I'm so excited.
[88:51.64]I'm so excited.
[88:52.98]I can't wait.
[88:53.64]I'm on the watch for the first time ever.
[88:55.72]Oh, it's just so exciting.
[88:58.83]I swear to God, I'm going to be the best Nightingale recruit you've ever seen.
[89:01.53]Oh, I'm so excited.
[89:05.55]Zoom!
[89:07.07]Did you see that?
[89:07.53]Pretty big, eh?
[89:10.35]The bailiff and his hands live there.
[89:12.44]And our maestro proto-notarius, the scribe.
[89:17.02]And the jailhouse.
[89:18.41]You don't want to see the inside, not even as a guard.
[89:24.44]Is this not the train?
[89:26.16]Fuck, I just, like, spit.
[89:31.52]This pillory was brand new in autumn.
[89:33.34]Ooh, ooh, pillory, pillory.
[89:34.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[89:35.42]I read about those in my coloring books.
[89:41.66]Anything else?
[89:42.16]What else can you tell me?
[89:48.30]I'll take care of it.
[89:49.32]Hey.
[89:49.52]Don't do that.
[89:50.63]Dude, sorry.
[89:50.99]It's free country.
[89:51.51]Uh...
[90:18.87]You should let her stay sorted out between... Yeah, you guys deal with it.
[90:22.67]It's free country.
[90:23.91]What are you going to do?
[90:30.22]Uh... You guys have a good Christian?
[90:31.50]Uh-oh.
[90:31.84]Now we're flipping it.
[90:32.64]Hold on.
[90:45.60]Might be.
[90:46.66]Might not.
[90:47.14]Oh, come on now.
[90:48.08]Did you get any arms or not?
[90:50.16]Yes.
[90:52.16]From the armorer here?
[90:54.52]I don't know.
[90:55.48]And even if I did, that was yesterday.
[90:58.11]And my belly's empty again today.
[90:59.89]That's true.
[91:01.33]Hmm.
[91:02.25]Okay.
[91:02.41]What would you know about it?
[91:06.31]Okay.
[91:06.45]We'll both contribute to poor Jane.
[91:08.49]Give Jane Alm's armor.
[91:10.00]Give Grotchen to the beggar.
[91:15.78]I don't know what his skills are.
[91:20.08]Give Jane alms.
[91:21.70]What is alms?
[91:24.94]I got higher points in nobility here.
[91:29.52]You know what?
[91:30.24]I'll settle this dispute.
[91:31.77]Here, Jane.
[91:32.57]Take this and be on your way.
[91:34.03]Yes.
[91:36.07]Yes, thank you.
[91:36.91]I gave her one cent.
[91:39.55]God bless you, Henry.
[91:40.57]That's enough to get a loaf of bread.
[91:41.87]And what happens if she comes again tomorrow?
[91:44.80]I solved the dispute.
[91:45.63]Even if she comes back, don't even care.
[91:47.85]It's another day.
[91:48.61]We just push it forward another day.
[92:00.81]It's alright.
[92:02.59]My job was to keep the peace today.
[92:04.97]I'm training.
[92:05.61]Even if it happens tomorrow, it doesn't matter.
[92:08.07]Stop talking and keep up with Buckethead.
[92:09.77]Miss, excuse me.
[92:10.11]Let me help you carry that, Miss.
[92:11.53]What's the...
[92:24.44]Kick somebody?
[92:25.12]No.
[92:25.30]I got, like... I need to at least play for a while before we do any nonsense.
[92:46.70]The time's coming soon enough when the estates have to be handed over.
[92:50.40]Don't worry.
[92:50.90]Hey, how about this one?
[92:52.02]We'll treat the next one like a comedy show.
[92:54.12]How does that sound?
[92:56.87]Right?
[92:57.71]Alright, that's fine.
[92:58.29]The next one is going to be a comedy show.
[93:02.63]You guys want the comedy?
[93:03.75]You'll get it.
[93:14.34]Why was I so cautious?
[93:25.69]Alright, what's the next dispute?
[93:26.75]Okay.
[93:26.91]There seems to be nobody here.
[93:53.45]It's raining.
[93:54.77]I think it's time for us to saddle up and go home.
[93:57.67]What the?
[93:57.93]Okay, he just disappeared.
[93:59.17]I'm done with the patrol.
[94:00.77]Alright, I became him.
[94:21.95]There's one alehouse here on the market square.
[94:24.33]The trader's tavern.
[94:25.79]The other's up by the gate.
[94:27.25]We'll be going there later.
[94:29.27]This is a long quest, huh?
[94:31.20]I better not fuck this up.
[94:32.70]This is an escort mission.
[94:34.32]You don't do comedy shows on escort missions.
[94:36.60]Sorry, guys.
[94:38.28]Comedy show's been canceled.
[94:51.11]Now, the comedy show has been canceled.
[95:03.98]You think I want to do this whole thing again?
[95:05.28]Wait, what?
[95:05.96]Didn't we just show charity and remorse to the person that was in need?
[95:18.76]Now you're telling me we're gonna set this guy straight?
[95:22.02]Comfortable, are we?
[95:23.64]Arms, please, sir.
[95:24.98]Who do you take me for?
[95:26.58]Are you stupid or just insolent?
[95:28.74]Oh, what's the matter?
[95:29.96]Stupid, then.
[95:31.22]There's no begging allowed here, so pick up your stinking arse and haul it somewhere else.
[95:35.27]Hey, I stink, too.
[95:37.15]Me, us, everyone.
[95:39.81]If the hunter saw you here, he'd take a whip to you.
[95:42.41]Alright, alright, I'm going.
[95:44.64]I'm not gonna do it.
[95:45.98]Not gonna happen.
[95:46.66]Sorry guys.
[96:00.25]No, that'll ruin everything.
[96:02.21]This is a really, really easy job, it seems.
[96:03.90]You just have to go to the beggars and say, hey, don't do that.
[96:06.38]And walk around.
[96:06.86]Where's the commotion?
[96:30.64]I thought medieval Europe, I thought people were like spitting each other's faces and mouths and shit.
[96:35.68]And like murdering each other.
[96:37.74]And getting into bar fights and throwing people over tables and doing duels like ten paces, turn around, shoot.
[96:44.52]What was it?
[96:45.20]We just like shoo off homeless people?
[96:46.70]What the fuck is this game?
[96:47.68]Come on.
[96:47.98]Come on, make something happen.
[97:09.96]The Ratte Fiefdom is pretty big.
[97:12.18]Naturally, it starts here by the town and continues along the Sassau River all the way to... Ten paces bow duels, yeah.
[97:17.63]Then there's Gallows Hill, lots of farmhouses gathered around...
[97:22.81]Ah, Master Smil.
[97:23.79]Please tell me more about Shadrath City.
[97:25.91]I really love Shadrath.
[97:50.58]Cadgar, please send me your elemental to walk me around the castle.
[98:01.78]Here we go, watch, ready?
[98:02.62]Get up, you fucking filthy bastard!
[98:05.28]No begging allowed near the weeds.
[98:09.24]Wait, what?
[98:09.68]This is... Isn't this the guy that... Oh shit, I gotta go.
[98:20.47]I'll go back and talk to that guy.
[98:30.45]That's the guy!
[98:33.44]That's the guy that beat my ass over and over again.
[98:35.56]He's begging on the street now.
[98:36.82]Oh boy, he's... What did I tell you I was gonna do to him?
[98:40.52]Get the hammer and the nails now.
[98:42.06]I did say I was gonna murder him.
[98:44.19]When the bailiff finds out Moimir's slacking off, he'll be in serious shit.
[99:08.70]And being a friend of his, you wouldn't want that, would you?
[99:10.80]You wouldn't want that, would you?
[99:12.41]So it's better if I deal with it, and we leave the bailiff out of it, right?
[99:15.93]Right!
[99:17.11]Yes, I suppose so.
[99:18.45]So where is he?
[99:19.59]I fucking thought.
[99:20.73]He was thirsty, so he went for a nail.
[99:23.95]We know how that goes.
[99:25.57]Come on, Henry.
[99:26.65]Let's go and find that idler, and you'd better talk some sense into him.
[99:30.91]You turn the fuck around and don't look at us and leave.
[99:44.91]What the hell?
[99:46.19]Yeah, what the hell?
[99:47.71]What the fuck are you doing here when you're supposed to be on the gate?
[99:50.87]You fucking idiot!
[99:52.17]Move your carcass and don't guard the gate!
[99:54.23]Don't guard that gate!
[99:55.46]Not a word.
[99:56.30]Get moving.
[99:57.22]You're lucky it was me found out, not the bailiff.
[99:59.44]Or God forbid, Captain Bernard.
[100:01.66]Out!
[100:03.86]Come and sit with me, Henry.
[100:05.34]I'll never do that again.
[100:08.49]Sit down.
[100:09.07]No, I don't want to sit down.
[100:13.98]What?
[100:14.36]This is... Oh, there he is.
[100:15.50]Oh, God.
[100:16.00]I have... Oh, man.
[100:18.45]I just put in broad daylight here.
[100:23.45]Can anybody not... Can I make sure nobody sees this?
[100:26.93]There's nobody here.
[100:28.09]No witnesses.
[100:28.91]No one.
[100:29.57]Absolutely no one.
[100:30.47]Not one person.
[100:31.83]Not one fucking person.
[100:32.73]I can do it, right?
[100:33.47]Can I do it?
[100:38.94]Oh, put it away.
[100:39.60]No, no, no.
[100:39.78]Finish the mission.
[100:44.99]Get out of the fucking way.
[100:48.45]Wait, did he come in here?
[100:49.43]He did, right?
[100:50.13]Is this him?
[100:52.29]Oh fuck, wait, did he... Where did he go?
[100:54.38]Oh no, wrong way, wrong way.
[100:57.64]Where did he go?
[100:59.40]No, he did go up there.
[101:00.48]Was that him?
[101:01.14]They're all the same guy.
[101:02.80]Oh no.
[101:06.02]Where did he go?
[101:17.44]Alright, so what were you saying?
[101:23.28]That fool got me all worked up.
[101:27.58]Yeah.
[101:28.68]Me too.
[101:30.06]My words exactly.
[101:31.56]And just when we need every pair of eyes.
[101:34.04]You never know when the humans might creep up on us.
[101:37.06]Humans?
[101:37.40]Isn't that a spice?
[101:38.22]Let's not let it spoil our day.
[101:40.20]Listen, since we're sitting here anyway, how about a little game?
[101:45.20]Why not?
[101:46.24]Why not?
[101:50.83]Okay, this is... you've learned entertainment in games.
[101:55.49]Real great police work.
[101:58.57]Oh, what are we doing here?
[102:04.78]What the fuck are you talking about?
[102:08.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:12.90]So this is Farkle.
[102:15.03]The goal of this is two player game is to be the first to reach a certain number of points.
[102:19.09]Six dice are thrown and the players alternate turns.
[102:23.69]Points are gained for every one or five thrown.
[102:26.55]And for three or more of any kind, there's a number of scoring as follows.
[102:29.31]Okay.
[102:33.38]Is this just window?
[102:34.36]You know, you just have to roll dice to get points.
[102:41.40]Okay.
[102:42.34]One is worth 100 points.
[102:43.72]So you want to get low numbers.
[102:44.84]Three of a kind is worth 100 points multiplied by the given numbers.
[102:50.85]So you're just looking to just try to get as low numbers as you can and as many of them.
[102:56.27]Throw all six dice.
[102:57.17]And you can hold them.
[102:59.27]Okay.
[103:00.88]Whatever.
[103:02.84]So how do I... Can I only... Okay, well I got three of a kind.
[103:14.44]Um... Okay, well... Score and... I'm gonna hold these.
[103:25.80]It's just like sorcery.
[103:26.94]Okay, now that this is... Now I can actually do this.
[103:28.78]What the fuck was that all about?
[103:31.00]Alright, let's hold the one.
[103:34.06]And... Hold the twos.
[103:42.33]Alright, I can only do...
[103:47.48]I guess you can't do it more than once.
[103:48.58]Because I can't... Hmm.
[103:52.56]I'm... I think I have to hold these.
[103:58.42]Hold... I can't hold anything.
[104:00.84]I guess I have to just go.
[104:10.55]One and five, and then... I'm just trying to get more numbers or something.
[104:17.93]Pairs aren't really worth any points.
[104:18.97]You need three, right?
[104:19.73]Hold on a minute.
[104:23.26]Like, are you... The key element of the game is that if the throw does not produce a single scoring die, then the player's turn is over and all the points gained up to that point are lost.
[104:34.98]Okay.
[104:44.43]I can't read, so I can't play it.
[104:50.92]There's an opportunity to cheat, but it's more difficult to find loaded dice.
[104:54.58]Now, this is not like Swindle Stones.
[104:59.52]This is a little different.
[105:06.95]I need to sit here and read this whole thing, so just bear with me for like 15 minutes.
[105:24.66]Oh, whatever, I'm like... Read five, well, it's... What's going on here?
[105:46.11]Oh, that's him.
[105:49.83]This is Yahtzee.
[105:52.74]What's it doing?
[105:54.55]Oh, he's doing it.
[105:55.69]He's rolling.
[106:11.35]He actually can't read.
[106:13.01]Okay, let me just be honest.
[106:13.93]I just don't care.
[106:14.57]I'm going to be real.
[106:19.17]I just don't care.
[106:19.83]I don't want to sit there and play that game.
[106:21.96]I don't care.
[106:23.67]That's it.
[106:24.21]I don't care.
[106:25.39]I don't want to play that game.
[106:27.15]I want to play the actual game.
[106:30.53]I don't fucking care.
[106:31.57]Bad ending.
[106:33.53]I see.
[106:51.86]Should I go and ring the bell?
[106:53.22]If you wouldn't mind, the bell is hanging outside the rat house.
[106:56.68]Ring three times, then go to the trader's cabin.
[106:59.22]It's not that I don't get... I love swindle stones, but, like, that was... You just sit there and you play dice.
[107:05.99]Like, I don't want to play dice.
[107:06.95]I'll be honest.
[107:08.57]I don't even care if it takes ten minutes to play.
[107:11.03]No.
[107:11.17]I just want to play the game.
[107:13.54]I walked around... Look, look, look.
[107:14.50]I just walked around in a circle for, like, fifteen minutes.
[107:16.86]You want me to sit down and play dice?
[107:18.74]No.
[107:19.12]I want to go ring the fucking bell.
[107:25.82]Where's my torch?
[107:34.21]Do we even have it equipped?
[107:37.19]It wasn't even equipped?
[107:41.79]Alright.
[107:43.04]Go ring the bell.
[107:47.24]It's over there.
[107:49.70]Ding ding.
[107:55.84]dice game of Riot.
[107:56.98]I don't want to play dice.
[108:05.81]Don't worry, that guy will die, I promise.
[108:21.47]Riot it is.
[108:23.25]No, I do, come on.
[108:24.99]I have such, my patience is so thin.
[108:27.17]We just did the walk around Shadrath for 15 minutes.
[108:32.00]And then I sit down and do more stunning police work by playing a game of dice.
[108:38.04]Uh-uh.
[108:40.92]This whole quest has been like a 25 minute walk around ordeal.
[108:43.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:48.20]I need to move.
[108:52.25]Ding dong.
[108:58.43]Close the trousers.
[109:01.87]I'm gonna close all the stores.
[109:13.26]I'm drinking too many moldy coffee beans.
[109:16.32]Alright, which way?
[109:17.08]This way.
[109:23.41]There really is a curfew, huh?
[109:36.65]Everybody get inside.
[109:37.51]This is when the hunt starts.
[109:42.29]Oh, so you're a hunter.
[109:46.51]Did I not do it in time?
[109:48.87]And the canon of St.
[109:50.23]Vincent's Lodge in Olomouc was so drunk, he dragged the pig to the market square, saddled it up, and rode it out of the town gate!
[110:03.69]No, I'm not gonna bully this guy again.
[110:06.13]So, Sir Peter and I rode off to look for the good cannon on his pig.
[110:13.80]We tracked the filthy beast down to a sty beyond Crona.
[110:16.80]I mean, the beast with a tonsure on its head.
[110:20.84]We never found the real pig, but the Reverend was sound asleep in the pigsty.
[110:25.48]Hey, wrap it up, boys.
[110:27.46]Curfew.
[110:28.28]I look like a concerned dad.
[110:44.93]Am I going to be a good boy?
[110:46.61]Buyers around?
[110:48.19]I'm afraid we don't drink with peasants.
[110:50.47]You're not in your village now, boy.
[110:52.47]I own your boat.
[110:53.50]I own your champion's boat, tournament boat.
[110:55.40]It's mine.
[110:57.44]Nothing closes while I'm sitting here.
[111:01.24]If that's all, you're dismissed.
[111:03.99]Are you out of your mind, lad?
[111:06.11]You can't cross his lordship.
[111:07.97]He's got a temper like a bear with gut ache.
[111:10.90]If I was you, I'd get lost before he shows it.
[111:13.94]The bailiff instructed me to close the tavern at the proper hour.
[111:16.34]He doesn't want anyone disturbing the peace after curfew.
[111:18.56]What was that?
[111:19.52]The bailiff?
[111:20.92]The bailiff can kiss my arse?
[111:24.12]I trust you haven't forgotten who's the rightful lord of Ratte?
[111:27.64]No.
[111:28.58]It's Sir Hannes.
[111:30.80]Did you just fucking... Hiding under the table, maybe?
[111:36.12]Ooh.
[111:36.73]So am I. So am I. I'm wearing a bubble wrap shirt.
[111:41.71]Ooh.
[111:41.89]You can't fuck with a guy with the packing paper.
[112:06.38]So I get to kick this guy's ass again.
[112:12.57]Oh, I didn't dodge it.
[112:23.37]Fine, you wanna play rough?
[112:25.66]How come that's not working?
[112:27.76]I thought he was tap, right?
[112:34.38]Tap left or right?
[112:38.00]Oh, fuck.
[112:38.90]What?
[112:40.18]Is it getting broken up?
[112:40.98]Do I need to do this?
[112:43.64]Crucifix!
[112:45.16]What in the name of Christ is happening here?
[112:47.80]Losing to a Dr- Can you dodge?
[112:50.52]This peasant insulted me.
[112:52.92]I had to teach him a lesson.
[112:54.23]By rolling around in the mud like a hog?
[112:56.89]I didn't lose.
[112:57.55]You're not supposed to lose or win.
[113:00.25]Silence!
[113:02.69]You shut your mouth and thank your lucky stars that you are Radzig's ward.
[113:07.63]Have you gone out of your mind?
[113:10.01]Raising your hand to a nobleman?
[113:11.83]Shut up.
[113:13.49]I wish I could say that.
[113:14.29]I'd be such a rebel teenager.
[113:15.90]Drinking with your subjects might be good for their morale, but it's bad for your honor.
[113:23.42]You spend all your days drinking and chasing wenches, which wouldn't matter if you paid any attention at all to your duties.
[113:31.73]And now we see what that leads to.
[113:35.37]Dad, you look like a picnic.
[113:37.43]Nice tablecloth shirt.
[113:39.94]That would be such a... I would get a bunch of applause.
[113:42.58]Dad, I'm not sure if I should give you a hug or play checkers.
[113:46.60]Slap across the face.
[113:58.10]Really?
[113:59.16]Naturally.
[114:00.25]Who am I to deprive the young Lord Capon of his sport?
[114:04.45]And you can take Henry here as your page.
[114:09.21]Absolutely not.
[114:12.80]It's time you learned how to lead people.
[114:15.30]I think it's time for a massacre.
[114:17.38]Have I lost you that quickly?
[114:21.64]In all capitals, it's time for a massacre.
[114:25.60]Is that guy the king?
[114:26.86]I forget.
[114:27.56]I do.
[114:28.59]I'm sorry.
[114:29.07]For a second, I thought that was that guy.
[114:30.35]That guy's dad, right?
[114:30.99]We still have to close this place down.
[114:35.35]Oh, wait.
[114:35.53]It's this guy.
[114:57.25]He's the prey.
[115:00.35]Alright, let's take a little bit of a break here.
[115:02.83]Let me go... Are we still on the same quest?
[115:08.16]No, that one's done.
[115:10.24]Meet Lord Kapan at dawn in the upper castle in the courtyard.
[115:15.00]Okay.
[115:17.10]Activities.
[115:17.46]Do me a favor, punch me.
[115:18.54]More fights.
[115:19.34]The good thief.
[115:20.40]I could do the rest of this.
[115:22.50]Go and see Teresa.
[115:26.30]I need a weapon or something, man.
[115:28.46]I don't want to carry around a fucking rock anymore.
[115:34.69]No, I ain't playing dice.
[115:35.79]I'm not doing it.
[115:38.67]I wonder if I need help.
[115:40.13]Alright, where is he?
[115:41.91]You guys know he was out this way, no?
[115:44.14]Where is he?
[115:48.46]We're gonna go find that guy.
[115:49.48]Alright, I'm gonna wash myself.
[115:54.96]I'm gonna get an arrow right in the back of his head.
[115:57.67]And I'm taking the hammer and nail.
[116:02.21]See if we can find him.
[116:04.61]Nope.
[116:07.47]He was down one of these side streets, but he was back here, right?
[116:11.17]Somewhere around the corner.
[116:13.96]He's gone.
[116:15.06]Why would he be gone?
[116:15.66]Nope.
[116:16.80]That's terrible news.
[116:24.31]Let's pull out the torch.
[116:29.13]I'm a serial killer right now.
[116:30.76]I'm just Jack the Ripper.
[116:32.64]It's dark and rainy.
[116:33.70]I'm looking for some peasant to kill.
[116:37.46]I'm the bad guy in this situation.
[116:39.32]In every sense of the word.
[116:50.11]I think that's him.
[116:54.88]Hi there.
[116:55.16]Hey, uh... Let's say you take the night off.
[117:01.20]You know what I'm saying?
[117:02.84]Here's a couple of pennies for your trouble.
[117:05.10]What do you say?
[117:05.58]And so will you be very soon.
[117:12.76]Be reasonable.
[117:13.10]Do you really want... Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[117:29.33]I could kill you in a second.
[117:33.19]Here we go.
[117:33.49]The revenge.
[117:33.83]What is he... What?
[117:34.41]What am I doing?
[117:34.81]Is he scared of fire?
[117:36.05]What happened?
[118:01.64]Alright, well, apparently... Okay, now we're in darkness.
[118:04.88]What happened?
[118:05.60]See?
[118:08.56]He's just afraid of fire.
[118:12.02]Alright, I'm happy about that.
[118:14.51]We're gonna get some money.
[118:15.47]Okay.
[118:15.63]Hmm.
[118:34.25]The guard's not leaving.
[118:35.11]The guard's right behind me.
[118:36.97]I could get some money from this.
[118:38.63]Let's get the information and then slit his throat.
[118:41.10]Alright, then.
[118:42.80]Start talking.
[118:44.04]No.
[118:45.12]First, I want you to swear you won't be demanding anything else.
[118:49.50]Oh, you have my word.
[118:50.70]Okay, I want that.
[118:52.06]True darkness.
[119:16.05]Alright, I'm going to get it.
[119:17.25]I'm going to get it.
[119:18.93]Scavenger.
[119:19.45]What are you talking about?
[119:21.09]What about you?
[119:21.61]Aren't you doing the same thing?
[119:45.01]You can't just walk around in the dark.
[119:46.74]Oh, my God.
[119:47.42]What are you... You have to have a light.
[119:49.06]Where's your light?
[119:50.38]Oh, my Lord.
[119:51.20]Okay, wait.
[119:53.50]He got... He ran away.
[119:54.74]He went this way.
[119:55.26]I saw him, like, walk away, too.
[119:56.72]God damn it.
[119:57.52]What the hell are you doing?
[120:07.94]Let's see where this motherfucker goes.
[120:15.35]I'm gonna go in a house.
[120:17.64]Hope so.
[120:24.94]Why is the king just walking around at night?
[120:28.08]What?
[120:28.56]Why is he doing this?
[120:30.26]What if I kill the king right now?
[120:34.61]If I murder the king, does the game end?
[120:41.81]And no one else is walking with a light.
[120:52.07]Once this guy turns a corner, we're knocking him off.
[120:56.35]Who's there?
[120:59.73]Who are you?
[121:03.54]Okay, will you turn into an alley man?
[121:10.10]Jesus, look where you're going.
[121:11.36]Oops, I just bumped into him.
[121:13.28]Do it and take the king's clothes.
[121:14.90]Okay, I'm going to kill the king, take all of his clothes, and then pretend to be the king, see if anybody notices.
[121:22.98]When's the last time I saved?
[121:26.20]Right now.
[121:34.86]So you can only save when you have that potion.
[121:52.97]I want this guy to turn somewhere.
[122:03.33]You can save by sleeping in a bed that's yours.
[122:05.12]Oh, that's cool.
[122:09.70]This guy isn't too far in the open.
[122:13.90]What's that?
[122:14.38]What does it look like?
[122:23.30]It's a weapon.
[122:23.90]That's what- what do you think it is?
[122:35.48]God dammit, I missed him!
[122:39.18]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[122:42.08]No!
[122:42.92]Ugh!
[122:52.95]I don't have the proficiency to use this.
[122:54.67]I have to take out the bow and then use the mouse.
[123:23.39]He didn't even know he died, he just was like, I'M DYING, WHAT HAPPENED?
[123:29.85]Alright, now I have to pick him up and really, like, torture this guy.
[123:43.47]Nobody saw that.
[123:45.11]I got away with it.
[123:47.33]Wait a minute, he's still alive.
[123:48.58]No, he's not.
[123:52.92]Alright, now what if I come out?
[123:55.76]Wait, do I have the arrow still?
[123:56.74]Oh shit!
[123:59.60]Put it away!
[124:00.18]Put this away!
[124:01.60]Put that away!
[124:06.30]Huh?
[124:07.68]Oh right, the darkness, right.
[124:08.82]Oh, hi.
[124:09.40]Yes.
[124:14.19]Ah, what?
[124:14.75]Unbelievable!
[124:16.05]I can't believe it happened!
[124:17.47]What?
[124:17.95]You wanna eat this guy?
[124:28.05]What if I pick him up?
[124:31.83]If I pick him up, is it going to cause a problem?
[124:35.15]Is it?
[124:35.35]Oh, goddammit.
[124:38.64]Shit, I have to kill him again.
[124:59.88]Oh, what the fuck?
[125:11.22]I did save.
[125:12.06]I saved it right here.
[125:21.63]Only the Executioner and Gravediggers can handle the dead?
[125:32.11]God damn it!
[125:35.06]No, don't load the very beginning of the game!
[125:43.56]Peggle 2 waiting room.
[126:06.98]Oh, come on.
[126:07.70]How did that not happen the last time?
[126:09.50]I can't believe I grabbed the body.
[126:14.46]What's that?
[126:20.71]What do you mean, what's that?
[126:24.23]Okay, it was right here that it happened.
[126:25.43]Right here.
[126:30.75]She's still alive.
[126:36.08]Alright, I'm done.
[126:36.86]I... Last attempt.
[126:40.56]Last time.
[126:41.36]And that's it.
[126:57.14]What's going on?
[126:57.54]Why is he bleeding?
[127:09.49]Got it.
[127:13.45]I stabbed him in the back accidentally.
[127:14.63]Okay, here we go.
[127:15.05]This is where I have to stay hidden.
[127:22.63]Take out the torch.
[127:36.23]Okay.
[127:36.83]We're safe, I think.
[127:40.97]What did you get, you motherfucker?
[127:43.93]I'm gonna go to your goddamn house that's burnt to the ground.
[127:46.49]I'm gonna pick up those nails.
[127:50.73]Fucking wanker.
[127:51.57]Alright, we're good.
[127:57.45]Now let's go to the thing that he told us.
[127:58.83]Let's go get some free shit.
[128:00.33]What do you think?
[128:00.83]Free stuff?
[128:05.46]So where was that?
[128:09.14]Good job, 47.
[128:11.81]Good job, 47.
[128:13.03]Payments in the mail.
[128:14.05]Alright, so that was way out here, huh?
[128:23.58]Where is, um... Wait, because he's dead, did I lose the information?
[128:42.05]I can't go back to the place I was before?
[128:44.27]Do I have to leave the town?
[128:48.66]But I had to write it down.
[128:52.74]Scavenger, right?
[128:53.62]I guess it's not explored.
[128:55.24]I have to go out.
[128:57.42]Find the treasure under the dovecote.
[128:59.17]Okay.
[129:02.43]Well, there it is.
[129:03.03]I'm not going to go punch the king.
[129:13.12]Let's just do the next part.
[129:14.84]I'm gonna go to sleep.
[129:16.24]Where's my bed?
[129:18.70]Where's my actual time to go to sleep?
[129:23.25]Where's the bed?
[129:23.73]There's so much shit on the screen here.
[129:24.97]Where's the bed?
[129:26.71]Bedroom.
[129:28.41]Bedroom.
[129:29.31]Back here.
[129:38.88]Alright, goodnight.
[129:44.29]See you in the morning.
[129:49.87]Somebody else in the house?
[129:53.21]Oh.
[129:53.75]Oh, it's Theresa!
[129:55.83]I can talk to her, right?
[130:10.47]No.
[130:12.78]I'm not doing it.
[130:18.13]Too scared to kill the king.
[130:20.31]I'm not gonna do that.
[130:22.67]Wait, I'm gonna eat first.
[130:24.63]It would be too easy.
[130:26.89]Yes, it would.
[130:29.33]I'm gonna sleep in my bed.
[130:30.40]That saves the game.
[130:31.44]And we're dicking around.
[130:36.00]And we're gonna sleep for... One, two, three, four.
[130:41.52]We'll just get to... We'll get to, like... Oh, right here.
[130:43.91]Dawn.
[130:44.53]Dawn.
[130:50.07]Give in to my demons.
[130:57.25]It is a secret Easter egg if you punch the king.
[131:03.65]Kill the king or dice game.
[131:10.44]No.
[131:13.52]Game saved.
[131:18.56]Get up.
[131:21.04]Alright, let's like, let's like really like wake this guy up and ruin his day.
[131:30.69]Stepping all over his mouth!
[131:40.08]Um.
[131:41.26]He's gone.
[131:46.12]Got rid of him.
[131:47.81]Finally.
[131:51.96]Nope, there he is.
[131:53.02]Can I sleep in his bed?
[131:58.02]Does this guy wear a diaper?
[132:00.32]He is?
[132:00.62]Wow.
[132:03.26]That's a couple of... You know, the game always talks about know your opponent, know his secrets.
[132:07.14]That's going to be a dialog option now.
[132:10.34]You think I'm going to give you any more money?
[132:12.42]One of the options.
[132:13.38]You wear a diaper.
[132:14.78]Oh, you know that?
[132:16.68]Okay, your debt has been repaid.
[132:20.41]Let's go.
[132:30.91]We're here.
[132:31.61]Might as well just do this now.
[132:34.15]Just wait for her and just do this.
[132:37.11]There is something to do here.
[132:38.56]There is a thing to do here.
[132:41.34]Might as well talk to Teresa.
[132:47.04]Teresa!
[132:51.81]Come on out!
[132:59.64]Die for his equal money.
[133:02.92]I'm expected for the hunt?
[133:06.15]I'll be fine.
[133:08.23]I'm a good multitasker.
[133:15.59]Is she still asleep?
[133:55.43]I was hoping she was going to wake up.
[133:58.71]That's so scary.
[134:00.13]Alright, fine.
[134:00.87]You have one more hour.
[134:01.76]Imagine just waking up and somebody's just looking at you.
[134:16.14]What time is it?
[134:16.84]How long do you sleep till?
[134:20.72]What time is it right now?
[134:21.76]Honest to God, it is... No, let me sleep.
[134:24.90]It is 7, it's almost 8am.
[134:26.87]Get up.
[134:28.31]Back in the medieval times, people woke up at like 4 in the morning and went to bed at like 2.
[134:34.99]Let's go.
[134:35.29]No, don't... No, let me sleep.
[134:45.92]Fine, goodnight, bye.
[134:50.75]See, Dad's awake.
[134:52.43]Oh my lord, whatever.
[134:53.33]Just gonna wash myself in the tub.
[135:02.05]Alright, uh, let's fast travel quick.
[135:05.89]To... I need to go over here, meet at dawn.
[135:08.67]Is it dawn?
[135:09.25]It's dawn, right?
[135:12.96]I mean, it's not really dawn.
[135:14.74]It's pretty far away from dawn.
[135:16.08]What's going on here?
[135:32.42]OK.
[135:38.78]People walking around.
[135:39.60]I think I have to close the game.
[136:02.39]Yay, good thing I was saved.
[136:05.28]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, no.
[136:06.16]What?
[136:06.88]What?
[136:11.61]Am I an ant?
[136:12.37]And it's ridiculous that you transformed into a beetle!
[136:14.62]Where are we?
[136:14.96]That guy didn't sign the release form.
[136:16.22]That's why his face had to be blurred out on video.
[136:18.68]I really should pay my debt to the miller or things will end badly.
[136:21.52]What is he talking about?
[136:48.28]Oh, it's okay.
[136:48.66]Um... Return the miller's money.
[136:54.15]Um...
[137:14.14]Where... Where am I?
[137:15.92]I'm over here.
[137:16.36]Oh, you must be mistaken.
[137:23.47]Everyone thinks I'm Henry.
[137:26.09]I'm the Invisible Man.
[137:27.15]Alright, it's dawn, right?
[137:30.95]Dawn!
[137:38.63]It's like four or five hours after dawn, but, you know, I'm still here.
[137:49.55]Okay.
[137:49.99]I made it.
[137:52.59]I'm ready to go on the hunt, Dad.
[137:57.75]Sorry, I'm late.
[137:59.63]Where is he?
[138:00.01]Oh, you wouldn't believe the morning I had.
[138:06.93]I'm ready to go on the hunt.
[138:10.71]Here I am.
[138:13.15]I'm overjoyed.
[138:15.25]Have you got a horse?
[138:16.80]No, sir.
[138:18.24]Mm-hmm.
[138:18.40]Wait.
[138:18.58]I want a horse.
[138:18.94]Do we have to fist fight him for it again?
[138:21.64]Follow.
[138:21.90]I don't understand.
[138:22.60]Do I get to ride a horse?
[138:47.76]Do I get this horse?
[138:49.44]Or do I have to walk behind him?
[138:54.21]I can't... No, I have to literally run behind him.
[139:04.62]I'm not gonna punch the horse.
[139:15.95]I'm not listening.
[139:16.79]Why can't I just steal a horse?
[139:17.89]I can't just get on one?
[139:19.37]I've played enough GTA to know you can do that.
[139:30.02]I'm a peasant, so... I so badly wanted to shoot him in the head with an arrow.
[139:49.49]I'm going to pretend I'm riding the horse.
[139:50.97]Yes, sir.
[139:51.65]I'm trying to jump on the back.
[139:53.63]Yes.
[139:53.91]I was just...
[140:13.55]Why am I bleeding?
[140:14.31]Is he running into me?
[140:15.53]I'm just blocking his path.
[140:17.70]Get teased.
[140:47.05]I'm getting hit by the horse's hooves.
[140:48.73]Is that what's actually hurting me?
[140:49.87]Alright, something about that's really funny.
[140:57.35]On horse.
[140:59.55]I strayed out.
[141:00.19]I can't even do it.
[141:03.78]He's suddenly not a bad person anymore.
[141:05.54]Now he's not a dick.
[141:06.20]Yeah.
[141:15.66]Thanks.
[141:16.18]Running into his sword?
[141:17.10]Shut up.
[141:17.50]It's in its sheath.
[141:18.44]It can't be stabbing.
[141:19.74]Tackle the horse.
[141:47.54]What are we going to hunt?
[141:48.56]Pheasants?
[141:48.92]Ooh, can you take me there?
[141:53.12]This is so bad.
[141:53.60]This sucks.
[141:54.24]Why would I be running?
[141:54.78]Accident.
[141:55.00]Oh, fuck.
[141:56.58]He can't hear me.
[141:57.04]I need to go up so he can hear me talk.
[142:23.57]Alright, as I was saying.
[142:24.63]I think I broke the dialog by turning around.
[142:32.61]Yeah, I did.
[142:51.12]What is going on here?
[142:55.49]nest?
[142:55.99]Why is he just sitting down on the grass?
[142:57.83]I'm gonna have to punch him to get him working again?
[143:07.88]No, these escort quests.
[143:12.92]This is actually truly beautiful.
[143:14.90]This is great looking.
[143:18.18]Nice work on this part of the game, guys.
[143:28.76]It's just turned into a real boring trek.
[143:42.19]Is something else supposed to happening?
[143:43.94]Is something else supposed to be happening here?
[143:59.37]They're just supposed to be talking.
[144:04.19]He's just riding into nowhere.
[144:11.85]This is just a really, really passive-aggressive, awkward walk.
[144:25.95]So are we gonna go to the ends of the Earth?
[144:27.87]It was supposed to fast forward.
[144:29.17]You have zero patience.
[144:30.41]What?
[144:30.93]What are you talking about?
[144:31.91]Because I turned around to look at something and turned back around?
[144:35.85]The game doesn't want to progress the quest?
[144:41.22]I turned around for two seconds and then I looked back and I caught back up.
[144:53.79]I turned around to look at a thing for less than five seconds.
[145:00.41]Fast travel point.
[145:01.74]It's still gonna work.
[145:06.88]We're about to cross the traveling threshold.
[145:09.24]It's gonna happen.
[145:09.78]We're gonna get a loading screen here in two seconds.
[145:17.29]I don't want to walk the whole fucking way.
[145:19.71]How far is this?
[145:22.03]We're almost there.
[145:23.48]No, I'm not.
[145:43.21]I can't even fucking hit him.
[145:45.71]Okay, right now my left hand has the controller and my right hand is using the mouse.
[146:02.18]Oh my fucking god, what is going on here?
[146:04.60]Okay.
[146:07.78]I think it worked.
[146:15.32]Simple geometry.
[146:18.76]Alright, here we go.
[146:19.68]Follow hands, there we are, we're here.
[146:24.83]Good.
[146:26.43]Alright, remind me not to go anywhere else besides behind this guy.
[146:36.26]Imagine if I accidentally hit him right in the head with the arrow.
[146:38.28]It's a good thing I missed over and over again.
[146:39.64]We would have done the same damn thing.
[146:41.88]Missed five minutes of dialog.
[146:43.56]Just take Wikipedia this guy's story.
[146:45.29]You'll get it.
[146:54.91]Steal the horse and leave him.
[146:59.15]Okay, sure thing.
[147:11.55]Fetch wine and bacon.
[147:15.79]Yes, sir.
[147:16.14]Anything for you, sir.
[147:22.34]There.
[147:23.50]Hey, Cookie, CRM.
[147:24.64]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[147:26.34]Right now.
[147:30.26]I was supposed to save up my money for an expensive statue, but I'm throwing money at you, so please play Roblox Battlegrounds like a real gamer would.
[147:37.72]Thanks again, Jeremy.
[147:39.36]I love you, big smiley face.
[147:44.00]Roblox Battleground.
[147:49.10]What do you mean?
[147:49.98]A statue.
[147:54.36]Thank you so much, dude.
[147:57.18]What was the statue of?
[148:03.17]Hunting is a diversion.
[148:05.36]The main thing is to get out of Ratte for a while.
[148:08.58]Listening to Hanush's lectures all day... Isn't Roblox just Minecraft, but there's no hard edges?
[148:17.78]What are we going to hunt?
[148:20.56]Humans.
[148:22.37]I thought I said humans.
[148:23.35]I was looking at chat.
[148:24.13]I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[148:25.31]What is this, Ramsay Bolton?
[148:26.59]You should see your face.
[148:30.67]I got you there.
[148:32.29]Oh, he did say humans.
[148:41.12]But what about you?
[148:42.54]Before, I couldn't get a word out of you.
[148:44.08]Now your tongue's loosened.
[148:46.42]So, tell me about scallops.
[148:48.32]I heard Sigismund had a hundred banners there.
[148:51.81]Hey, thanks, Bob the Pineapple, for the one dollar with a smiley face.
[148:53.99]Thank you.
[148:56.43]I really don't want to talk about it.
[148:59.22]If I only wanted... No, it's just a couple of humans.
[149:02.18]Humans are humans.
[149:04.12]It's my escort's duty to entertain me, so talk.
[149:07.36]As you wish, my lord.
[149:09.97]Alright, we're about to do like an accidental hunting accident.
[149:14.65]Both of my parents were killed.
[149:15.93]And then I take all of his stuff.
[149:17.37]Right in front of my eyes.
[149:19.27]The humans slaughtered my friends and neighbors, and it was a miracle I got away.
[149:24.35]I don't know what else I can add.
[149:25.73]I'm sorry about that.
[149:27.98]But tell me...
[149:29.27]I just keep thinking of the spice that's in all the spicy food.
[149:31.37]Like Mexican food, Indian food, just cumin.
[149:33.86]I just keep thinking of it's a bottle of spice and arms and legs and shit.
[149:37.26]Why are they calling them cumans?
[149:38.34]What does that mean?
[149:38.86]Christian humans?
[149:59.69]Oh, I want, that's an ice cream, ice cream sandwich.
[150:01.37]I want some of that.
[150:02.33]What?
[150:04.37]That's a huge ice cream sandwich.
[150:13.12]What are we doing?
[150:18.82]I don't understand.
[150:20.40]This is a real, this is a real group of people.
[150:22.06]I mean, this is, let's see.
[150:30.51]So they were old people.
[150:31.41]They were old Turkish people.
[150:35.75]So they're not Christian humans.
[150:36.89]They're not cow humans.
[150:39.19]Oh yeah, just humans.
[150:54.70]Cow humans.
[150:55.84]Just a couple of cow humans.
[151:01.56]What do you want us to do?
[151:04.44]Alright, Hans, I'm ready.
[151:06.64]Greetings.
[151:07.96]What do you need?
[151:10.81]Bye.
[151:12.67]Alright, let's wait Until Dawn.
[151:17.87]So what time is it now?
[151:21.47]Alright, I'm gonna sleep Until Dawn.
[151:25.24]That guy can sit there and drink and eat and shit.
[151:26.84]No, I'm gonna go to bed.
[151:30.81]Hold on, wait, what?
[151:34.14]We have to sit here for 12 hours?
[151:47.22]That's a long time.
[151:57.64]Wait Until Dawn.
[152:06.31]Yeah, I wanted to get you out here to do a camping trip.
[152:14.67]Alright, here we go.
[152:17.49]I'm gonna wake up and he's gonna be eating and drinking and stuff.
[152:19.43]Alright, where's he at?
[152:27.22]Is he dead?
[152:27.64]Oh, okay, I thought that sword was through his side and it was bleeding.
[152:34.66]I thought the scarf was blood.
[152:37.32]I was like, well, alright.
[152:42.76]Too early.
[152:43.62]It's about to be dawn in like 10 seconds.
[153:05.13]Oh, yeah.
[153:05.59]So I- Oh, what's that?
[153:06.99]I did wake you up at the right time?
[153:08.19]Because it is dawn right now.
[153:09.39]Don't go back to bed.
[153:10.27]Oh my god.
[153:11.89]Yeah.
[153:12.57]It's dawn right now.
[153:14.85]Sir.
[153:16.15]Sir, I know you didn't hit the snooze button.
[153:19.05]Which, by the way, the iPhone snooze button's only eight minutes.
[153:22.67]Bullshit.
[153:23.15]I understand that, but you gotta get up.
[153:25.55]Sir?
[153:26.63]Wake up, sir.
[153:27.49]It's time to go.
[153:29.57]What?
[153:30.55]Are you mad?
[153:31.51]It's still dark.
[153:33.57]I thought we were going to get an early start, sir.
[153:35.89]Early means at first light.
[153:38.59]Light, you dolt.
[153:40.71]Do you want me to break my neck in the black of night?
[153:43.25]It's light out right now.
[153:45.35]It is.
[153:48.25]Like, this is light out.
[153:49.17]Like, the sun is coming up right now.
[153:50.39]Is there anything to cook?
[154:07.87]Alright, is it dawn now?
[154:15.28]What time is it now?
[154:22.76]This is clearly, clearly dawn, alright?
[154:25.65]It is.
[154:26.25]This is light.
[154:27.15]This is like 6, 7 AM.
[154:32.33]Okay, I'm gonna give you one more hour.
[154:45.21]if you still don't think it's dawn right now then you have another thing coming dawn get up sir wake up sir it's time to go
[155:07.04]This guy doesn't understand.
[155:13.78]Oh yeah, the black of night.
[155:21.94]It sure is dark outside right now.
[155:25.60]Go back to sleep, goddammit, it's too early!
[155:28.18]I'll just go do it by myself.
[155:34.08]Alright, let's wait another hour.
[155:40.22]Kill him.
[155:42.90]Oh, hey.
[155:44.00]Are you up?
[155:45.22]What are you waiting for?
[155:47.20]Your lord requires you for the hunt.
[155:49.18]Give me a break.
[155:50.84]Really?
[155:52.16]Such a renowned hunter needs help.
[155:54.60]Really?
[155:54.96]Okay.
[155:55.22]Would you dare mock your betters now, would you?
[155:59.10]Heaven forbid, your lordship.
[156:00.98]If that's the way you want it, peasant, we'll meet back here at noon.
[156:05.97]Meet back here at noon?
[156:08.01]Oh, and if you don't have anything to shoot with, there's a crate in the camp with some old hunting equipment.
[156:12.87]Oh, okay.
[156:13.43]I thought that was just a long-winded way to tell me that he was going back to bed.
[156:16.17]I gotta go get rabbits.
[156:24.02]You'll soon be laughing on the other side of your grubby face.
[156:26.52]Okay.
[156:27.10]And now turn your back for a while.
[156:29.30]I know a few tried and tested spots in these woods, and I don't want you stealing them.
[156:35.64]Alright, we did it.
[156:36.12]Jesus, look where you're going!
[156:39.13]Alright, now... Where's the crate with the supplies?
[156:41.67]What if I just went back to bed?
[156:45.67]Alright, where's the crate?
[156:48.19]There it is.
[156:49.87]Give me some hunting arrows.
[156:53.69]I just took a bunch of stuff.
[156:54.97]Whatever.
[156:55.27]Okay.
[156:58.11]I've got weapons, better hunting arrow.
[157:02.83]This thing is... This thing... This is just way better.
[157:06.09]I'm just going to use it.
[157:08.13]And then a say.
[157:11.92]Okay.
[157:12.96]Let's go hunt some rabbits.
[157:19.12]Oh god.
[157:20.92]What do I need to hunt?
[157:22.58]Is it rabbits?
[157:24.98]Hunting hares.
[157:28.32]Let's go.
[157:29.58]Hunt hares.
[157:31.16]In the woods.
[157:34.06]No, that's a rock.
[157:40.77]Was that a rock?
[157:41.77]That's a mushroom.
[157:42.31]Rabbit!
[157:50.35]Rabbit!
[157:57.38]That didn't hit him?
[157:58.02]What?
[158:12.92]My archery is so bad.
[158:14.12]I don't have one point in it.
[158:26.98]Fuck it.
[158:31.16]I'm gonna do it the way that my fucking, like, grandfather would have done it.
[158:55.83]This sucks.
[159:04.21]Can I sneak up on these things?
[159:06.15]I will never hit this.
[159:15.83]I will never hit that in a million years.
[159:17.57]It'll always be off by like a hair.
[159:22.35]Yeah.
[159:35.83]I have to shoot him, huh?
[159:37.39]I have to shoot him with my zero fucking archery skill.
[159:40.43]I can't wait.
[159:46.18]Oh my fucking god.
[159:48.48]Give me a break.
[160:00.81]Archery is impossible.
[160:04.10]You gotta be kidding me.
[160:07.20]Like, holy shit.
[160:17.84]Oh, got it!
[160:18.32]I got it!
[160:25.12]Holy God.
[160:34.19]What time is it?
[160:45.92]Did I get... I got one.
[160:47.02]What, do I have to be there by noon?
[160:50.35]Pick up the arrows.
[160:51.01]I did, didn't I?
[160:51.53]I need to run into red dot sight.
[160:56.23]Didn't I pick up the arrows?
[161:44.30]What time is it?
[161:45.10]How do I see the clock?
[161:48.24]Okay, I got some time.
[161:49.72]Don't wait.
[162:06.05]Where's he going?
[162:17.92]He was like stuck and glitched, I wanted to see what he was gonna do.
[162:27.96]I had my chin- I wanted to see what he was gonna do, I thought he was gonna walk right in front of me.
[162:30.57]Don't worry, I'll get it.
[162:32.71]The guy's only gonna get like two rabbits anyways.
[162:36.75]See, he's still fucked up.
[162:38.09]This is a guy that I shouldn't even be attacking.
[162:43.47]Oh my god, again, give me a fucking break.
[163:03.91]Oh my god.
[163:04.81]I'm gonna run.
[163:14.45]Somebody just gave like $300.
[163:15.50]Why?
[163:35.83]No, man, no.
[163:37.67]No.
[163:39.99]I would have been able to shoot this rabbit in real life with a bow and arrow.
[163:46.13]Oh, my God.
[163:51.03]Hold on.
[163:52.45]First of all, let me pause the game for a second.
[163:57.24]In real life, I would have been able to kill 20 rabbits by now.
[164:01.97]Thank you Ace McLace for the 250 dollars.
[164:08.88]250 bucks.
[164:09.26]That's like an extreme amount of money.
[164:15.58]Hey Jerma, just wanted to say that I've always loved your content and was stoked when you started streaming.
[164:20.46]For about a year I have brain damage due to an injury during my time in service.
[164:25.21]I can't work and sometimes I can't get out of bed.
[164:28.74]With my TBI, it came severe depression, but whenever you start a stream, I always feel a lot better.
[164:34.22]I love you, Jerma.
[164:34.86]We all do.
[164:37.10]Ace, thank you so much.
[164:38.64]That's a lot of money.
[164:43.64]That's an extreme amount of money.
[164:45.91]And I'm sorry that you have... You got an injury for your time in service.
[164:51.87]For whatever country or whatever... If it was the United States or wherever in the world, thank you for that.
[164:56.25]Thank you for your service, first of all.
[164:59.35]And second of all, that sounds like an incredibly difficult thing to deal with.
[165:07.80]Severe depression with it.
[165:13.40]I am so grounded.
[165:16.18]Absolutely grounded by the fact that you have these things to say about me.
[165:22.11]Thank you so much, man.
[165:23.69]I appreciate it.
[165:27.71]You guys are why I do this, right?
[165:31.63]And that's... It just seriously changes my perspective on a lot of things when I hear a story like this.
[165:42.71]You're talking about me and shit.
[165:44.25]It's like... I wish you the absolute best.
[165:50.26]And I'm sorry that you have this injury that you have to deal with.
[165:56.64]But thank you so much.
[165:57.76]I'm glad I can even contribute even a percentage to make you feel better.
[166:08.25]Thank you for the $250.
[166:26.30]At the end of the night, there's nothing but love.
[166:27.72]This is why the community is magical.
[166:29.37]This chat, this stream.
[166:31.09]Honestly, it's true.
[166:36.71]We talked about this before.
[166:37.51]There's a lot of shit talk.
[166:39.73]There's a lot of fun.
[166:40.45]There's a lot of nonsense that happens in these streams.
[166:42.67]But at the end of the day, you guys are all fucking awesome.
[166:48.13]Thank you for being here.
[166:53.51]Now watch me continuously miss shooting bunnies with bow and arrow.
[167:00.20]Is it noon?
[167:04.76]I hear him talking.
[167:07.50]There he is.
[167:13.45]Wait, he gets dogs too.
[167:14.43]Oh wait, that's not him.
[167:20.15]What are these guys doing?
[167:24.74]Wait, guys, guys, guys, guys, that's not the right way to- I was just trying that.
[167:27.44]Trust me, you don't want to do that.
[167:28.44]You can't chase it.
[167:30.68]I told you, I was using the same technique.
[167:32.06]You gotta listen to me.
[167:36.34]If you- if you- Huh?
[167:38.26]Huh?
[167:38.80]Huh?
[167:40.06]Huh?
[167:40.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[167:43.15]What are you doing?
[167:48.59]Why are you doing this?
[167:50.13]I'm trying to give you hunting tips.
[167:56.00]Why are you still alive?
[167:57.89]Why are you still alive?
[167:58.99]Get the fuck out of my face.
[168:03.11]Come on.
[168:11.60]Who are you?
[168:12.64]Who are you?
[168:17.36]You're dead.
[168:20.62]Please leave.
[168:21.84]I just wanted to have a hunting competition with my friend.
[168:25.69]Leave me alone.
[168:27.29]Oh my god.
[168:28.25]I'm gonna have no more arrows left.
[168:30.91]I'm full of arrows.
[168:36.51]Why are you alive?
[168:37.69]You've taken five arrows to the face.
[168:39.41]I've hit you in both eyes by now.
[168:43.61]Alright.
[168:43.87]I ain't fucking around.
[168:44.63]I'm bringing out the machete.
[168:47.04]Take out the machete.
[169:00.11]God damn it.
[169:06.29]Swing!
[169:06.67]Do something!
[169:13.78]Why do you get a shield?
[169:14.66]This is so dumb.
[169:15.40]Not gonna bleed out.
[169:29.55]Got him.
[169:30.05]Okay.
[169:30.47]One more guy.
[169:30.93]Guy with the arrows.
[169:32.74]Don't do it.
[169:33.06]Don't shoot.
[169:33.46]Don't do it.
[169:33.86]Don't do it.
[169:38.02]Don't do it.
[169:38.58]Don't do it.
[169:38.94]Should have thought about that, dickhead.
[169:55.12]I didn't even look.
[169:55.66]I didn't even look.
[169:56.14]I didn't...
[169:58.15]I just freaked out.
[169:58.84]I'm bleeding.
[169:59.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[170:00.36]How do I heal?
[170:02.16]Where's the heal button?
[170:05.22]Okay, apply.
[170:08.48]I'm not bleeding.
[170:09.02]No, I'm still bleeding.
[170:09.82]Where's the other guy's body?
[170:11.12]That guy had a shield.
[170:12.03]That guy had a lot of stuff.
[170:13.95]Where's his body?
[170:15.89]God damn it.
[170:16.59]Where's that guy's body?
[170:28.15]Cheap wine.
[170:29.18]That'll make me feel better.
[170:34.80]Okay.
[170:35.72]Where did I kill that guy?
[170:41.42]There's this dude here.
[170:42.19]He was all the way down here, right?
[170:48.63]Did the body disappear?
[170:54.67]By the tree.
[170:59.01]Because that guy was shooting me from down here.
[171:00.57]I wish I didn't have a filter on my screen right now.
[171:19.37]Where is this guy's body?
[171:23.83]That's the archer.
[171:24.73]I ran right at him.
[171:31.00]Right by that other tree.
[171:32.79]It's like the whole forest is full of trees.
[171:36.35]There's trees everywhere.
[171:41.05]He's over by the tree.
[171:45.13]I know, I know he's by a tree.
[171:50.55]He's in there.
[171:52.19]Okay, come on.
[171:53.15]This guy was part of the grass.
[171:58.12]Give me a break!
[171:58.70]This guy got- This guy turned into the soil!
[172:02.08]Look at this- Look at the camouflage!
[172:04.14]Look at this!
[172:07.81]Oh man, there's a lot of shit here.
[172:09.09]I gotta- We'll go through it in a second.
[172:11.95]Okay.
[172:13.99]I need to eat- I'm over- I'm over-encumbered.
[172:18.72]I'm not conspicuous at all, that's fine.
[172:22.44]What do they have?
[172:24.74]I got a shield now.
[172:26.64]Decorated goblet.
[172:27.56]This doesn't even count as stealing.
[172:30.41]This doesn't even count as stealing.
[172:32.99]That's awesome.
[172:38.13]Nine?
[172:39.27]Nine?
[172:40.52]Wow.
[172:42.08]What about... I got an axe now.
[172:48.18]I got a shield.
[172:53.31]There's so much going on.
[172:54.27]Am I like... Wait, I... Wait, wait, wait.
[172:56.57]We gotta hunt hares.
[173:00.93]I still have to kill hares.
[173:01.85]I need to heal.
[173:02.57]How do I heal?
[173:03.13]I need a potion.
[173:05.33]Do I have any potions?
[173:08.86]I do, right?
[173:09.32]This is a potion.
[173:09.92]Alright, just relax.
[173:18.66]I'm getting my sanity meter back.
[173:28.45]Okay.
[173:28.87]I need to kill some more rabbits.
[173:38.54]Drunk and injured.
[173:44.05]I need to find a rabbit.
[173:45.21]More rabbits.
[173:54.43]I'm still healing slowly.
[173:56.06]What time is it?
[173:57.98]Oh shit, I have one hour.
[173:59.24]We gotta speed this up.
[174:03.20]I can't, I'm shit-faced.
[174:05.10]Is that a hare?
[174:07.04]It is, okay.
[174:07.84]There's a hare right there.
[174:12.03]I'm tilting sideways right now.
[174:16.33]Oh no.
[174:23.52]Nice burp.
[174:34.43]Oh god.
[174:35.99]I have no arrows.
[174:40.01]I don't have any arrows left.
[174:47.49]Not much changed.
[174:49.24]Alright.
[174:51.74]Can I throw the axe?
[175:02.77]Okay, we just need to hope.
[175:04.85]We need to hope that the hares that I have, that he had as much trouble as I did.
[175:11.68]I gotta wait for noon.
[175:13.36]Where's noon?
[175:18.12]Um, how many hares do I have?
[175:21.48]Okay, I have 36 hares.
[175:23.28]Do I?
[175:27.10]Wait a minute.
[175:27.96]I have 36?
[175:28.36]Where did I get 36?
[175:35.12]Okay, let me just go.
[175:35.90]I need to go back to the camp.
[175:36.74]I'm gonna go back here.
[175:44.09]Right?
[175:44.45]The camp is back there, right?
[175:46.43]Right!
[175:46.63]I don't even know where the camp is.
[175:49.75]What time is it?
[175:51.29]Shit, I gotta go now.
[175:55.86]I'm so heavy.
[176:10.10]Why am I this drunk?
[176:11.95]I guess I did drink a lot.
[176:13.79]I did drink a lot.
[176:19.07]There's a hare right there.
[176:20.31]Okay, do I not have any more?
[176:23.38]Weapons.
[176:24.24]Better hunting arrow.
[176:25.72]Good.
[176:28.70]Can get one here.
[176:34.35]He's taking a shit.
[176:35.13]Perfect opportunity.
[176:37.94]Oh, come on, this stupid drunk nonsense.
[176:44.38]He's having some constipation problems, it seems.
[176:46.33]That was an accident.
[177:04.65]This game is fucking so dumb, I love it.
[177:10.25]Alright, is it almost noon?
[177:11.75]Alright, let's just stay tethered to this area.
[177:18.67]We got another hour or so.
[177:24.44]Sleep to regain HP?
[177:26.10]I don't want to do that right now.
[177:29.98]I still need to get at least one more.
[177:41.92]I'm actually kind of glad I got ambushed there.
[177:45.85]Because that allows me... I just got a lot of money.
[177:50.47]Sleep for one hour.
[177:51.23]Now let me get one more hair, and then we'll go back.
[177:52.81]Is that a hair?
[177:59.29]Nope, just a rock.
[178:02.67]Hair?
[178:02.89]Nope.
[178:03.37]Flower.
[178:07.86]Ambushed?
[178:08.40]I chased them.
[178:09.56]Well, yeah, but I... They were just...
[178:12.68]I was ambushed!
[178:13.36]Alright, I need one more rabbit, please.
[178:32.24]This is a loud forest.
[178:33.47]Yeah, it is a very loud, audible forest.
[178:39.61]I don't see any more bunnies.
[178:41.63]Come on, I need one more.
[178:50.02]One more rabbit.
[178:53.42]Ah!
[178:56.20]Why are you doing this to me, game?
[178:57.92]Where are the rabbits?
[179:07.60]Oh, that's a rock.
[179:10.04]Did somebody just say, hey?
[179:14.56]Who's talking to me?
[179:15.36]Am I hearing voices in the forest?
[179:27.11]Who keeps saying hey?
[179:37.72]Hey!
[179:41.28]I definitely hear somebody.
[179:45.08]Rabbit.
[179:55.49]Shit.
[180:05.94]It's okay.
[180:06.34]There's another one right here.
[180:10.54]I can get two.
[180:11.26]I can get two right now.
[180:14.71]Oh my god.
[180:15.85]You.
[180:15.93]Alright.
[180:32.12]I gotta go.
[180:36.34]I'm good on time.
[180:49.09]Do you hear this?
[180:52.90]What are you doing?
[180:53.52]I need to find this guy.
[181:02.41]Anybody see or hear him?
[181:04.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[181:05.55]Look straight ahead.
[181:07.93]Here he is.
[181:10.22]He's right there.
[181:15.52]Why am I walking so slow?
[181:19.84]Is it more than one guy here?
[181:27.59]It's a camp!
[182:01.59]Oh fuck!
[182:02.85]Oh fuck!
[182:04.05]Time!
[182:05.57]No!
[182:05.85]Don't whistle!
[182:06.39]Go!
[182:07.19]Up the mountain!
[182:09.65]Oh!
[182:10.05]Oh!
[182:10.37]Oh!
[182:17.16]Why did I do that?
[182:18.48]Oh, I gotta get- I gotta drop some stuff.
[182:21.88]What do I- I- I- 165!
[182:30.76]What's the heaviest thing I own?

[182:37.00]12?
[182:37.40]Get rid of it.
[182:43.10]Food?
[182:43.36]What do I got for food?
[182:48.08]Woodcutter's Axe?
[182:50.30]24?
[182:51.02]Villager's Bow?
[182:51.67]Get rid of it.
[182:58.63]I want the shield.
[183:04.76]That's a lot of other... Boar hide.
[183:10.39]I got some heavy... The shield.
[183:13.25]Drop the meat.
[183:13.89]Why would I drop the meat?
[183:14.57]Don't I need the meat for the quest?
[183:18.29]Drop all the rabbits.
[183:19.63]No.
[183:20.21]Time is running out.
[183:21.27]I need to make a decision.
[183:22.09]Get rid of the bludgeon.
[183:24.37]I have three of these.
[183:25.13]Get rid of all of them.
[183:31.39]This thing too.
[183:34.55]And this thing.
[183:37.38]I'm ready to move.
[183:40.84]And how many of these do I own?
[183:43.18]Two?
[183:43.50]No, these are cool.
[183:44.94]I want them.
[183:46.74]And these.
[183:49.08]What about these?
[183:52.76]These are broken.
[183:55.46]Almost there.
[183:56.04]Get rid of the old boots.
[184:00.95]I got two of these, but they're both expensive.
[184:02.69]Nope.
[184:09.11]Thirteen.
[184:10.81]I'm stuffed.
[184:13.77]Okay, I think I can move now.
[184:17.70]Yep, I can.
[184:27.60]He's really actually behind me and he's hurting me.
[184:32.56]How are you faster than me?
[184:34.55]Oh, I...
[184:36.87]Don't make me do this, dude.
[184:38.38]Don't make me fucking do this.
[184:40.58]Can we get out of the fucking water?
[184:49.98]I'm not gonna surrender, are you kidding me?
[184:56.46]I need my weapon.
[184:56.94]Give me my weapon.
[184:58.40]Give me my fucking weapon!
[185:00.11]I don't have a weapon equipped.
[185:02.93]Alright, woodcutter's axe.
[185:25.23]Fuck yourself.
[185:27.51]Oh, what's that?
[185:28.07]No.
[185:28.43]Get the fuck out of here.
[185:30.75]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[185:31.45]No.
[185:32.21]He'll talk.
[185:33.55]Dead guy in the woods doesn't talk.
[185:38.53]Dead guy in the woods don't talk.
[185:53.06]Is it noon?
[185:54.12]Woo!
[185:55.58]Woo!
[186:00.09]You wouldn't believe how hard it was to get these hairs.
[186:02.17]Oh, okay.
[186:08.71]Okay.
[186:11.31]I'm back.
[186:14.89]Wait a minute, I forgot the sword.
[186:18.94]What?
[186:35.77]I'll come back for those.
[186:36.47]I thought that was a mummified body!
[186:57.20]Where was it?
[186:57.68]Where was he?
[187:01.20]No, don't pick up the torch, just pick up the weapons!
[187:22.23]Steel?!
[187:23.15]I put it down!
[187:24.51]No!
[187:38.95]Don't sit down.
[187:39.83]Get up.
[187:41.04]Get up.
[187:41.44]Get up.
[187:41.72]Get up.
[187:42.04]Don't wait for him.
[187:43.32]Get up.
[187:48.74]That's a good bow.
[187:49.98]Don't even tell me I fucked it up.
[187:55.61]That's a captain bow.
[187:56.67]I ain't fucking losing that.
[187:59.95]Okay.
[188:02.54]I have time, right?
[188:03.04]I have to wait?
[188:04.04]Or do I have time to go get it?
[188:09.34]In the chest?
[188:10.84]What do you mean, in the chest?
[188:15.86]What do you mean, get it?
[188:22.07]Wait, wait, wait.
[188:23.25]What are you guys talking about?
[188:28.75]Just put stuff in there.
[188:30.33]Am I going to get a cutscene and not be able to do this shit?
[188:48.27]Where's that guy's dead body?
[188:52.98]He was right down here somewhere.
[188:54.90]There he is.
[188:55.48]Alright, where's your sword?
[188:57.80]Where's the sword?
[188:58.68]Mercenary's sword.
[188:59.40]Get out of the way.
[189:00.26]I need to... Oh my god, get the fuck out of the way.
[189:10.13]Mint?
[189:10.39]He has a mint on him?
[189:11.57]What?
[189:13.77]Got it.
[189:26.53]Hey!
[189:27.57]Just in time!
[189:31.64]Alright.
[189:33.86]Hey.
[189:34.12]I don't know about you, dude, but that shit was easy.
[189:36.76]I had no trouble at all.
[189:40.40]How did your little rendezvous with the hares go?
[189:42.57]Probably not so good.
[189:43.89]Alright, let me see what I got here.
[189:56.42]I need to go through this.
[190:02.62]Can I not sort it?
[190:03.60]Okay.
[190:09.79]So this is 45 damage.
[190:14.29]Holy shit.
[190:15.05]Okay, nice.
[190:16.73]The bow is back on.
[190:20.51]The dagger is... oh, it's a torch.
[190:24.21]Alright, now what do you got?
[190:26.13]Vambrace's Kettle Hat.
[190:27.85]Padded Coif.
[190:29.93]This thing.
[190:31.09]Skullcap.
[190:33.39]Wait, no, no.
[190:33.79]I want the Kettle Hat on.
[190:39.56]Hunter's Gloves.
[190:40.82]What was better?
[190:42.00]Oops, a daisy.
[190:49.53]I kind of, you know, I kind of wish there was a, like, instead of, um, a long list like this.
[190:57.93]I'll go over this later.
[191:00.69]Come on, pants.
[191:01.97]Save the game.
[191:03.24]Game is now saved.
[191:10.18]So, how'd you do?
[191:12.83]I'm wearing this complete stolen gear.
[191:14.55]My guy is decked out as a guard.
[191:17.61]I am a guard.
[191:18.47]What a waste of a save.
[191:19.79]Everyone told me to save.
[191:21.55]35 bucks.
[191:43.86]We reached a new level in hunting.
[191:46.36]Okay.
[191:50.34]Follow hands.
[191:53.48]I don't... I can't mount up.
[191:54.48]I don't have a... I don't have one of those.
[191:59.00]I have to run behind him.
[192:06.58]I can drop all the hair meat now.
[192:07.88]What you meant to say is eat it all.
[192:13.00]Hair meat.
[192:15.84]Oh.
[192:17.02]No, I can cook this though, right?
[192:21.12]No, I'm going to cook this hair meat.
[192:22.58]I have a lot of it.
[192:26.12]Some would probably say too much.
[192:28.81]We'll drop this.
[192:31.05]No, that's a good one.
[192:31.93]We'll drop these ones.
[192:33.53]All of them.
[192:34.87]There we go.
[192:37.01]How many pretzels do I have?
[192:44.10]Yeah.
[192:44.85]I'm gonna eat it raw.
[192:45.79]Uh, mount up!
[192:57.88]I can't believe I have to run behind him.
[193:02.02]This sucks.
[193:04.55]Just one of the dogs.
[193:14.02]What happened to the shield?
[193:14.78]Oh, it was like broken, so I just threw it away.
[193:24.29]What?
[193:24.69]I threw it away.
[193:25.63]It was at like 30%.
[193:35.54]I can't keep up with him.
[193:36.32]I have to throw something down.
[193:43.17]He's gonna outrun me in a second.
[193:47.49]He's gonna outrun me.
[193:49.29]Alright, what do I need to drop?
[193:53.46]I have three torches.
[193:55.88]Drop two of them.
[193:58.48]What are these daggers?
[194:01.66]Woodcutter's axe?
[194:02.58]I'm not even gonna use this shit.
[194:04.60]Alright, I'm fine now.
[194:08.65]I'm gonna get lost in the woods.
[194:09.93]I have, like, an amazing mercenary's blade that I'm gonna use.
[194:13.45]The bitrate.
[194:24.72]Oh, it must be terrible right now.
[194:31.12]Even at 5000 bitrate, it probably looks so bad.
[194:39.51]All the grass, all the trees, all the leaves.
[194:43.69]I can imagine.
[194:50.81]Are we supposed to be having a conversation?
[194:52.55]Okay, we're supposed to kill these things.
[194:55.53]Right?
[194:55.73]We're gonna kill the deer.
[195:06.03]Are we supposed to be hunting these?
[195:07.29]Greg, whatever your name is, hounds.
[195:12.01]Hey, we're supposed to be hunting these hands, Ola.
[195:15.27]I know, I did it already.
[195:16.29]Hey, what are we doing over there, hands?
[195:18.79]Ola.
[195:20.63]Yeah, yeah.
[195:23.25]They'll be bored somewhere nearby.
[195:24.77]They'll be bored.
[195:26.87]Just like last time.
[195:28.47]Slow and quiet.
[195:31.21]Understand?
[195:31.63]Understand.
[195:32.29]Watch out for them from the top of that mound there.
[195:45.15]So we're looking for a pig.
[195:49.33]What happened to all my stuff?
[195:50.65]All my stuff is gone.
[195:59.54]You want to take him down with an arrow?
[196:02.44]Certainly.
[196:03.02]Why wouldn't I?
[196:04.66]You won't kill him like that.
[196:06.44]Boar is hunted with spears.
[196:07.78]So many illegal memes.
[196:09.18]Holy shit.
[196:10.04]Watch and learn.
[196:16.87]I can't wait till the memes, like, uprise, and they have to come back.
[196:20.75]I'm gonna get, like, I'm gonna, like, make a skit where I get consumed by them, and they break into my house and strangle me, and they come back.
[196:27.89]Next time you try to tell me I can't kill a boar with an arrow, you can... Fuck!
[196:33.99]After him!

[197:22.11]Where am I?
[197:22.67]I'm just lost in the woods.
[197:23.77]He left me.
[197:27.43]Oh my god.
[197:43.31]That would have been a pretty cool sequence if I was prepared with a horse.
[197:50.17]E-mode only mode.
[197:57.14]Did I find him?
[198:05.74]Where is he?
[198:09.67]Where'd he go?
[198:15.98]What does it want me to do here?
[198:19.26]I'm currently standing on an objective somehow.
[198:25.18]Oh.
[198:26.54]Right.
[198:31.62]I... I get it now.
[198:33.86]What do I... Get the marker off my screen, please.
[198:37.79]I want a marker over here.
[198:39.01]What does it want me to do?
[198:44.04]Is the boar over here?
[198:45.30]Is the boar's dead body here?
[198:46.70]I have no idea what's going on.
[198:51.77]But apparently A is right here.
[198:53.49]But it's not.
[198:57.51]I have no idea what's going on.
[198:58.79]I have absolutely no idea what's happening.
[199:03.68]It means he's inside that yellow border.
[199:11.56]Where the fuck is he?
[199:19.28]We're playing hide-and-go-seek now, this is great.
[199:28.95]Wait, what?
[199:36.33]Uh, this is a pretty big yellow border.
[199:53.58]Hans!
[199:55.12]Where'd you go?

[200:49.09]God damn it.

[200:58.59]Oh, for the love of all that is sacred.

[202:42.08]There he is.
[202:44.97]No, that's a blood stain.
[202:51.55]Why do I have to find him?
[202:53.55]Is there any trail I can follow?
[203:01.24]It's over.
[203:03.20]The whole chat was just deleted.
[203:05.58]There was no chat.
[203:08.21]It was just deleted messages.
[203:10.45]Have fun.
[203:17.59]It's over.
[203:20.91]It's being burnt to the ground.
[203:23.99]Somebody said northwest.
[203:24.87]Alright, I believe you.
[203:25.53]I believe the one guy that said that.
[203:35.84]Right there.
[203:36.96]There's a little piece of spaghetti there.
[203:38.12]That's where I gotta go.
[203:48.21]Found it.
[203:48.87]Oh my god, it really was the spaghetti.
[203:52.35]Where is he?
[203:53.51]Now this is a downed tree.
[204:02.64]You think he would be looking for me by now, really?
[204:05.54]You really- He would be looking for me.
[204:07.00]He'd be looking for me.
[204:07.83]He'd be like, where did that guy- Where the fuck is my friend?
[204:13.95]He would be look- There would be a search party with 500 people by this point looking for me.
[204:22.07]Ooh.
[204:23.43]Okay.
[204:23.95]I think this is it.
[204:24.53]Did I find him?
[204:27.37]Oh my god.
[204:32.06]What?
[204:34.14]How did this happen?
[204:46.99]Friend.
[204:50.95]How did I miss this?
[204:51.73]Because he took off on a horse and it didn't tell me where he went.
[204:53.95]I don't have a horse.
[204:54.65]I couldn't follow him.
[204:57.05]What the fuck is going on?
[205:03.87]Okay, well, um... Hans, we need to go faster than... He's just running.
[205:14.70]I need to follow him.
[205:15.36]I have to follow him.
[205:19.72]I'm sorry.
[205:20.32]I'm not losing this quest.
[205:24.66]Move.
[205:25.58]What are you doing?
[205:27.72]Oh my god, man.
[205:28.36]Are you serious?
[205:29.18]Don't... Where's your weapon?
[205:30.54]Does he have anything?
[205:38.30]Really?
[205:48.17]Come on, swing.
[205:50.29]Swing.
[205:56.44]What was that?
[205:57.40]What's... What is going on right now?
[206:01.39]I'll have a bronze bust made of you, my friend.
[206:04.26]But where have you been till now?
[206:06.02]Oh, you know, I was picking berries, had a drink of wine, took a little nap.
[206:11.44]You lunatic!
[206:13.26]Well, I got some more stuff.
[206:15.10]I got some more free stuff down there.
[206:18.12]Now look here, dung grubber.
[206:21.57]Is that any way to speak to a nobleman?
[206:25.29]That's like the third time he's said that.
[206:26.73]It's kind of losing its weight after a while.
[206:39.71]That wound doesn't look good, Sir Hans.
[206:41.95]You're right.
[206:43.31]Those cumin swine... Did you officially do it?
[206:46.21]And my damned horse is bolted.
[206:48.69]You'll have to get me home somehow.
[206:50.62]The sooner we get out of here, the better.
[206:53.18]Who knows how many bandits are creeping around here.
[206:55.96]Let's go then.
[206:57.16]I've had quite enough excitement already.
[207:01.89]Alright, so now... I guess we moved on.
[207:06.45]It's Lord Capod!
[207:08.02]And he was injured in a hunt.
[207:10.20]Open.
[207:10.73]Open the gate.
[207:14.67]Watch me get stopped here.
[207:17.35]Oh, excuse me.
[207:17.81]Need to be searched.
[207:19.70]I got a dying guy here.
[207:21.96]Get out of the way.
[207:37.35]There goes the loot.
[207:38.63]No.
[207:42.76]How is it possible, Ratsy?
[207:44.98]Those bastards make so bold no more than a mile from the castle.
[207:49.68]We'll have to send out more patrols.
[207:52.08]That won't do us any good, Hanush.
[207:54.45]Even if we had ten times the bandwidth... That we were done with PS1 games?
[207:57.47]This is not that.
[207:58.51]You sent for me, sir?
[208:00.13]Come in.
[208:02.61]I don't know how to thank you, Henry.
[208:04.99]If it wasn't for you, Hans would be dead.
[208:08.75]To think I sent you out with him as a punishment.
[208:12.35]I was only doing my duty, sir.
[208:14.37]Don't be so modest, young Henry.
[208:16.65]You showed not only courage, but loyalty to your liege.
[208:19.39]So I did a good job.
[208:20.47]That's why I'm taking you into my personal service.
[208:22.75]Oh, I get to be his squire?
[208:25.03]Sir, I... Thank you, sir.
[208:29.07]Well, let's celebrate your promotion and Sir Hans' recovery.
[208:34.41]Don't just stand there, lad.
[208:35.47]Pour us a drink.
[208:43.99]I'm sorry to interrupt, sir, but I have urgent tidings.
[208:47.43]What now?
[208:47.93]Kill the king.
[208:48.75]A stable boy came from Neuhof.
[208:53.09]He says brigands raided the stud farm this morning.
[208:56.23]There's many dead or maimed.
[208:59.21]Cool.
[209:01.20]Tell us exactly what happened.
[209:02.38]I want that wine pourer.
[209:03.38]That looks really cool.
[209:04.18]The boy was so shook up he could barely speak.
[209:07.16]He said the bandits murdered for the joy of it.
[209:11.67]Oh, you think I'm bringing Nex back?
[209:13.43]You're out of your mind.
[209:14.15]You guys could trade all the memes for Nex.
[209:18.77]You're never getting it back.
[209:19.95]Literally ever again.
[209:20.63]I should just enable it?
[209:21.69]Just to disable it on stream.
[209:22.55]That's how much I hate it.
[209:38.03]Earth will be back.
[209:38.71]Earth's on vacation.
[209:39.41]Next, Skate 3.
[209:40.45]Next is so useful.
[209:41.09]No, it's not.
[209:41.51]It was abused.
[209:42.11]Streamer can't take criticism.
[210:05.39]What?
[210:06.05]PogChamp.
[210:06.89]What?
[210:07.07]I just got a horse.
[210:07.65]My first horse.
[210:08.13]And go change out of that pillow top bed cushion.
[210:10.69]You look like a fucking idiot.
[210:31.60]God damn it, Squire, you look like a bed sheet.
[210:34.10]Get the fuck out of my sight.
[210:41.58]Alright.
[210:41.86]What am I surrendering for?
[210:42.86]Surrender.
[210:43.32]What?
[210:43.58]What are you doing?
[210:44.54]Get away from me.
[210:45.42]Get away from me.
[211:00.58]Why is this guy throwing punches?
[211:04.89]What did I fucking do?
[211:05.91]I didn't do anything.
[211:08.11]Oh my god.
[211:09.13]Give me a break.
[211:12.79]Surrender.
[211:13.19]Justice for what?
[211:14.39]He wants 30 bucks.
[211:29.83]You're making a serious mistake.
[211:31.85]If only you knew what you just got yourself into.
[211:34.74]This won't end well for you.
[211:37.82]You'd make a stuffed bird laugh.
[211:40.08]But that won't help you much.
[211:42.08]God damn it.
[211:44.44]Take it.
[211:44.76]Take the money.
[211:45.12]Get out of here.
[211:46.19]You've paid for your crimes.
[211:47.85]I hope you've learned your lesson.
[211:52.07]I don't care.
[211:53.23]30 bucks.
[211:53.49]Whatever.
[211:53.75]I don't even know what it was for.
[211:56.68]Because I'm walking around with... Do I have an illegal helmet on?
[212:01.71]Something like that.
[212:02.21]Where's my... Speaking of helmets.
[212:05.69]No, I am wearing it.
[212:09.09]Alright, I got a lot of stuff to sell.
[212:11.89]Let me go do that.
[212:14.91]So, let's go to, like, the trader.
[212:17.24]Let's go to this guy.
[212:18.04]Let's go to the armorer.
[212:27.18]Get on the horse.
[212:27.76]I will.
[212:28.92]My brain is locked onto this right now.
[212:30.48]I'll get the horse in a second.
[212:34.73]What is going on?
[212:40.45]But payments.
[212:41.87]More payments?
[212:43.09]I don't want to pay any more money.
[212:46.87]Oh my god.
[212:47.55]How much is it?
[212:48.11]I'm going to lose all my money to credit card debt.
[212:57.74]How much do I owe you?
[213:00.34]It's like 50 bucks?
[213:03.42]How much was it?
[213:09.46]How much money was that?
[213:12.29]Oh my god, it was like 50 bucks.
[213:13.79]Did I even pay any money?
[213:21.51]Okay, can I please... I'll get my horse later.
[213:33.81]I need to dump off a lot of this junk.
[213:38.65]Hello.
[213:40.21]How you doing?
[213:42.69]Trade.
[213:46.13]So, let's go with, I got... Okay, he won't take this because it's stolen, but he'll take these.
[213:52.23]I don't want these.
[213:52.75]I don't even need them.
[213:56.78]That's all he'll take.
[213:57.48]Okay.
[214:01.00]So what about the armor?
[214:04.19]I wouldn't beg good neighbors, but I'm reduced to this.
[214:08.53]Alright, so where's the armorer?
[214:13.11]Right here.
[214:15.39]He's right here.
[214:16.82]Is he in the same room?
[214:19.06]He might be in the same room.
[214:20.24]Is that the guy in the back?
[214:24.68]This is the guy that teaches you blacksmithing, right?
[214:35.44]Start.
[214:36.04]I ain't starting that.
[214:38.12]Not right now.
[214:39.86]Is he in the same room?
[214:42.91]Oh, donuts.
[214:43.45]Can I steal these donuts?
[214:45.13]I probably could, but I don't want to.
[214:46.21]It's right here.
[214:49.81]Alright, I have a lot of stuff for you to look at.
[214:51.65]Please take it.
[214:52.19]I need you to talk about this.
[214:57.30]Sell.
[214:57.44]Sell.
[215:02.94]Okay, Hunter's Gloves.
[215:04.32]That's a... Woo!
[215:05.94]44 bucks.
[215:06.44]Thank you.
[215:06.86]These are stolen.
[215:08.76]He won't take them.
[215:09.42]I'm gonna wear them.
[215:11.73]Um... These are, uh, kinda useless.
[215:15.25]So, take it.
[215:17.09]This is pretty dirty, but, um, it's alright.
[215:20.11]He'll take these.
[215:20.75]He'll take these.
[215:21.39]35 bucks!
[215:24.31]Mm-hmm.
[215:25.28]Take these ones.
[215:25.82]You can take these ones.
[215:35.09]Red and white hose.
[215:36.21]I don't want these.
[215:38.11]You take them.
[215:40.52]Actually, I probably should sort this by what's worth selling.
[215:47.72]Okay.
[215:48.52]I have these on.
[215:49.22]I'm going to have this on.
[215:53.72]What if I get a kettle hat?
[215:54.76]Yes, I'll sell the skull cap.
[215:58.91]Riveted gloves are better than these, but they're stolen.
[216:03.57]So, I'm not gonna sell those.
[216:05.21]These, though, on the other hand, I have two of them.
[216:10.75]This thing, uh, what did the coif sell this?
[216:17.28]Old boots.
[216:18.28]I have hunting boots.
[216:19.34]We're gonna sell the old boots.
[216:23.88]How much money does he have?
[216:26.39]Okay, he has money.
[216:28.21]Pilgrim shoes!
[216:29.03]Why are these selling for so much money?
[216:33.34]They're stolen.
[216:34.00]God damn it.
[216:37.81]Working boots.
[216:40.31]This is like a woman's dress.
[216:44.71]I don't want these either.
[216:48.43]Okay.
[216:49.03]That looks alright.
[216:49.75]Let's check the basket.
[216:53.08]Now, this is $214.
[216:53.58]Let's do a haggle.
[216:54.00]Let's talk about the price.
[217:01.12]Sure.
[217:02.02]Why not?
[217:02.82]Okay.
[217:03.16]For real, let's get this.
[217:04.40]I want... Let's go with 240.
[217:09.34]Agree.
[217:11.82]A nice sum.
[217:13.32]Just lower your demands a little and we'll agree.
[217:15.86]220?
[217:17.34]How about 225 and you get a deal?
[217:21.63]My last offer.
[217:24.03]A nice sum.
[217:25.53]Just lower your demands a little and we'll agree.
[217:34.00]I knew we'd come to an arrangement.
[217:35.30]Okay, now, what do we have?
[217:41.38]464.
[217:45.36]Holy shit, these are nice.
[217:46.18]What can I afford?
[217:55.92]What's the cheapest dumb shit you have?
[217:57.38]Okay.
[217:57.78]All the stuff I just sold.
[217:58.66]I'm going to buy the stuff that I just sold.
[218:02.36]I just buy it back like an idiot.
[218:05.76]Wow, those look good.
[218:06.82]Yeah.
[218:07.12]Alright.
[218:10.53]This is where we're starting to get the stuff that I don't own.
[218:16.99]Plate.
[218:19.47]Well, I don't have anything on my legs.
[218:20.77]Alright.
[218:23.48]Is it worth me buying these plate...
[218:27.71]That's a lot of defense that I don't have.
[218:32.26]It's a lot of money too, but I don't have it.
[218:34.74]Not worth it.
[218:40.74]Don't have enough money anyways.
[218:47.68]The weapon I have, I have a good weapon.
[218:50.58]That thing will last me for a pretty long time.
[218:55.36]It's my Mercenary's Bedfellow.
[218:59.67]I could probably ask about repairing it too, right?
[219:02.22]Eventually.
[219:02.68]I think it's down to like 50.
[219:03.60]Okay.
[219:06.94]Okay, I was going to put on... Let's see what I got here.
[219:11.30]This coif.
[219:15.16]These.
[219:16.30]These.
[219:16.72]I guess they're better than that, but they're stolen.
[219:23.27]Fan bracers versus... Yeah, these are better.
[219:25.07]Why are these things better?
[219:33.00]I got these for free.
[219:34.13]Why are they 10 defense?
[219:38.71]No, isn't this the thing that's gonna... No, that's like a guard.
[219:40.89]I don't think I want to wear that.
[219:41.81]I'll probably get in trouble.
[219:43.99]Will I get in trouble for wearing this?
[219:47.27]That's the thing that all the guards wear.
[219:49.12]I'm wearing a pretend guard outfit.
[219:57.40]Alright, I'll be fine.
[219:58.34]Okay.
[220:00.34]I'm gonna go get my horse.

[223:51.94]I ran right by it.
[223:53.02]Wait, is that it?
[223:53.46]That's my mount?
[223:56.08]Pebbles?
[223:57.56]This is my mount!
[224:00.52]Whoa!
[224:04.84]I just ran a lady over, I think.
[224:12.70]No, she's fine.
[224:13.30]Alright, what is it?
[224:15.72]Want me to ride?
[224:21.36]Ride?
[224:24.26]What does it say?
[224:26.94]Stop moving around.
[224:27.90]Follow the men?
[224:32.41]I'm very behind.
[224:33.23]I guess I'm very far behind right now.
[224:46.42]That deluxe sensitivity.
[224:50.31]Alright, let's just go at a nice pace here.
[225:00.04]It's almost like you went shopping.
[225:02.64]Yeah, but don't worry.
[225:03.34]My horse's name is Lightning McQueen.
[225:05.98]Can the horse jump?
[225:21.23]Yep.
[225:21.95]That's cool.
[225:24.63]I was doing it yesterday.
[225:25.85]Yesterday was just a blur.
[225:27.37]I wasn't even like a human being yesterday.
[225:33.25]What's the graphical preset I'm playing at?
[225:36.14]For the purposes of streaming the game, I have to turn it down.
[225:40.08]It's a very CPU-intense game, I think, at higher.
[225:43.28]But I'm playing on mostly high, with a couple things turned down to medium so I can play and stream the game at 60 FPS.
[225:54.41]Interesting site.
[225:57.85]Why is it interesting?
[226:09.30]What's so interesting about it?
[226:10.25]Oh, stay here.
[226:19.67]Interesting sight.
[226:23.51]Yeah.
[226:37.94]This?
[226:41.16]I don't get it.
[226:41.60]I mean, there's a little nook here.
[226:56.79]Maybe somebody appears here?
[226:57.87]Alright, I'm gonna wait.
[227:02.24]Let's wait an hour and see what happens.
[227:24.76]Nothing here.
[227:28.90]Apparently it's not that interesting.
[227:30.14]Alright.
[227:37.91]I'm gonna ram him.
[227:38.91]Ram him!
[227:43.99]Horseback riding and using the bow and arrow.
[227:55.75]Okay, why am I treating this like it's a car in GTA?
[228:02.01]I should not be doing that.
[228:04.23]Can the horse die?
[228:18.09]Yes, he can.
[228:19.39]Okay, we're going to take it easy on the old girl today.
[228:25.17]And they can break legs, too.
[228:31.71]Oh, interesting sight.
[228:32.77]We have an interesting sight here.
[228:36.88]What happened?
[228:41.20]Who did this?
[228:42.74]We need to do an investigation.
[228:50.63]Oh, smoke this fire.
[228:54.01]Sorry I'm late.
[228:55.77]You burnt your house down in the meantime.
[229:05.45]Just go marry Theresa.
[229:09.25]Everybody already has their horses hitched and everything.
[229:11.91]I'm just showing up now.
[229:13.53]Yeah, let me just do that.
[229:14.95]Yeah, everybody's already here.
[229:16.72]It's like we're waiting for the bride to come down.
[229:18.56]Have you been in that scenario?
[229:23.17]Everyone's sitting there in the chapel.
[229:24.78]Everyone's already there.
[229:25.90]The groom is there.
[229:26.92]And we're still waiting for the bride.
[229:30.04]Finally, she shows up.
[229:32.18]Where did the raiders go?
[229:38.69]What happened?
[229:41.73]What?
[229:43.45]What?
[229:51.81]The wedding's up.
[229:52.93]I haven't made the best start with it.
[229:55.29]But maybe I can still be of some help.
[229:57.39]I missed a lot, apparently.
[230:00.81]Smell.
[230:01.21]It's the stud farm owner.
[230:18.73]Oh, man.
[230:19.15]Give me a break.
[230:19.86]I went shopping.
[230:20.32]Ah.
[230:48.60]Oh, man.
[230:49.06]Alright, we have to stay here.
[230:50.90]Just count the area.
[230:59.99]I stood in a field for a while.
[231:03.71]It all makes more sense.
[231:04.79]Mount and steal.
[231:06.83]My horse.
[231:08.25]Other horse.
[231:10.51]Other horse is so good.
[231:11.76]Other horse is way better than my horse.
[231:17.47]Are they gonna know I did this?
[231:19.93]These people aren't even still alive anymore.
[231:21.73]What would they even care?
[231:34.34]No one's gonna know.
[231:34.92]I don't think anyone will notice.
[231:36.04]I really don't.
[231:37.12]Especially if I take this one.
[231:38.84]In the back.
[231:41.68]This one's courage is lower, but, you know, that's why it's over here.
[231:47.78]need lockpicks too well wait I'm supposed to be doing detective work not stealing horses ask I I can come back later if you no I saw you came with the soldiers and the sooner you know everything the sooner you'll catch those savages alright uh I'm sorry to trouble you man but could you tell me about the raid the noise woke us up me and smell

[232:21.63]I saw you came in.
[232:22.85]Do you get drunks coming here a lot?
[232:25.33]She doesn't know.
[232:25.95]But guys, I'm wearing the same outfit as everybody.
[232:29.19]I'm the same guy to her, to everybody else here.
[232:31.51]I just heard loud voices and screaming.
[232:34.97]It's so stupid.
[232:36.86]It didn't even occur to me at first that something could have happened to Smil.
[232:40.88]I didn't find out until the morning.
[232:45.03]Um, okay.
[232:46.65]Where did the noise come from?
[232:47.51]I'll avenge you.
[232:48.05]Not everybody's face blind.

[234:28.15]Yeah.
[234:29.23]But he cut me pretty good, the fucker.
[234:30.89]I think this guy's lying.
[234:31.63]Looking for me, the others started to come out then, so the raiders ran.
[234:34.86]This is a totally fabricated story.
[234:38.42]You walked out there to the huge, huge guy in armor with the big sword, the scariest guy, and you punched him with your fists.
[234:45.48]We're not looking for you to talk about how cool you are.
[234:47.41]You're not going to get on the local news, buddy.
[234:49.89]What happened, actually?
[234:50.83]What in the world happened here?
[234:52.95]The bastards attacked us.
[234:54.83]At night, a little before dawn.
[234:59.40]You should have seen the other guy.
[235:00.88]There they go.

[236:10.87]Gate is intact.

[236:18.45]Who cares?
[236:22.52]Knocked.

[237:09.64]Thank you for your time.
[237:15.58]What about this way?
[237:19.13]Broken gate.
[237:20.43]Found it.
[237:22.03]They went this way.
[237:25.01]Got it.
[237:26.77]Detective solved.
[237:27.79]Problem solved.
[237:29.79]How do I turn them in?

[237:39.76]I'll find them.
[237:43.76]They went this way.
[237:48.78]Cracked the case.

[237:56.48]Good job, Casey.
[237:57.20]You solved the detective.
[238:00.03]Case closed.
[238:01.03]Close the book on it.
[238:01.65]It's right here.
[238:09.66]Yeah, broken gate's right here.
[238:11.34]There's the fence, there's the gate.
[238:15.00]Got it.
[238:15.74]It was not.
[238:20.96]Area scouted.
[238:24.78]Anything else I need to do?
[238:26.16]I need to...
[238:29.87]Got a question of the survivors.
[238:38.48]Couple more survivors to talk to and then we should be able to wrap this up.
[238:44.20]One more guy here?
[238:48.08]You?
[238:48.18]Can you talk?
[238:49.16]Jesus, look where you're going!
[238:50.48]Am I smelling him?
[238:52.24]Damn!
[238:53.10]Oh, no, it's this lady.
[238:55.25]Be a bit more careful!
[238:56.17]I thought I walked out from where I was at!
[239:01.03]Alright, Mark.
[239:08.63]Are you well?
[239:09.89]Leave me alone.
[239:11.23]Go away.
[239:11.81]Am I going to fight him?
[239:18.85]But there's no need to be afraid.
[239:21.17]With your help, I'll find those bastards... Can I put the points into the smell-o-meter?
[239:24.91]They... They deserve it.
[239:27.23]What... What do you need to know?
[239:29.22]Tell me everything.
[239:30.54]What actually happened here?
[239:33.26]They... They killed the animals.
[239:35.38]Not the animals.
[239:36.66]Why did they kill them?
[239:38.26]Only the animals?
[239:40.06]Did they take anything?
[239:43.10]No.
[239:43.48]They just came to kill the animals.
[239:45.98]How did it all start?
[239:47.22]We...
[239:49.32]They killed the animals first.
[239:51.00]Not the ten dead people on the ground.
[239:54.26]Let me just walk over those.
[239:59.42]They could have been animals.
[240:12.80]We ran outside and it was chaos.
[240:16.20]Animals were dying.
[240:17.58]The stables were burning.
[240:18.88]And those demons everywhere.
[240:22.90]Stables were burning, huh?
[240:24.52]Interesting.
[240:24.84]Stables were already burning.
[240:26.78]Didn't that happen after they fled?
[240:28.54]No.
[240:29.50]It was to set the blaze when they arrived.
[240:31.84]You said they were demons.
[240:34.10]No, just vermin.
[240:36.16]Vermin type.
[240:36.64]Worthless human vermin.
[240:38.86]How many of them were there?
[240:40.89]Not many.
[240:43.45]There were just a few that came after us, but more around the back.
[240:48.27]I heard them yelling at each other.
[240:51.67]And in the back?
[240:52.55]Where in the back?
[240:54.65]Towards the woods.
[240:56.01]To the north.
[240:56.97]They were trying to get away.
[240:58.11]Got it.
[241:01.75]So some of them were running away, and the others were fighting.
[241:04.93]Aye, for a time.
[241:07.17]Then more of us came out, and we fought back, so the others fled as well.
[241:10.79]Beyond the woods north.
[241:11.29]I'm gonna go... Time to get revenge.
[241:12.65]Okay.
[241:12.79]Uh...
[241:40.02]He's stomping all over this lady.
[241:44.34]North into the woods.
[241:47.66]Time to close this case.
[241:51.65]We're going up here.
[241:52.87]Explore the area to the north.
[241:54.03]I got my weapons on me, right?
[241:56.29]Make sure I have everything equipped.
[241:58.35]Yep.
[242:00.85]Off we go.
[242:08.54]Damn it.
[242:11.95]Up on this path.
[242:17.61]Just avoid the trees, maybe.
[242:19.03]That would be nice.
[242:25.80]Slow it down a little.
[242:26.56]I don't want to get ambushed.
[242:34.84]Okay, it's right around here somewhere.
[242:37.90]Music changed.
[242:46.30]We got different sounds here.
[242:55.53]Anybody?
[242:55.85]Oh!
[242:57.51]It's a bloody bag.
[243:01.17]Okay.
[243:02.41]Even further up.
[243:03.13]Keep going.
[243:14.18]Can you fight on horseback?
[243:15.80]Yes, you can.
[243:17.76]I don't know how well I'm going to fight on horseback, though.
[243:21.68]I just got the horse.
[243:22.40]I don't want the horse to die.
[243:25.14]I can hear them.
[243:29.13]Here we go.
[243:33.89]Let's be civil first.
[243:38.09]I just heard a, hey, what are you up to?
[243:39.37]Hey, what are you up to?
[243:45.35]Found ya!
[243:45.99]There he is!
[243:46.39]There's the criminal!
[243:47.63]Hmm.
[244:04.60]Thought you could get away from me.
[244:05.78]Don't think so.
[244:08.11]Fuck it, I'm gonna go for it!
[244:18.27]You're gonna swing?
[244:19.09]What is this?
[244:25.56]You're good.
[244:26.14]You're good.
[244:26.64]Ooh, you're good.
[244:39.14]He is good.
[244:40.92]But I'm better.
[244:48.23]Damn.
[244:54.44]Gotcha.
[244:56.94]Nice dodge.
[245:03.57]I respect it.
[245:11.53]I respect it.
[245:12.11]Oh, what's that?
[245:13.79]What do you got?
[245:19.36]How do I question him?
[245:23.04]Can I not question him?
[245:30.33]I'm going to bring him back, right?
[245:35.71]I guess not.
[245:38.58]Oh boy, oh boy.
[245:42.22]I got the burger sword.
[245:43.00]There's more to look at.
[245:47.40]That was just one of them.
[245:48.78]Apparently there's more than one.
[245:51.05]You stay there.
[245:53.39]Daddy's gonna take care of this.
[246:07.36]Hey, late, but I'm the one that cracked the case.
[246:16.07]Better late than never, as they say, right?
[246:19.61]Uh, I'm kind of almost out of the outskirts here.
[246:21.92]Where's this other guy?
[246:27.64]Hmm.
[246:31.78]Look for blood?
[246:34.92]Any more?
[246:36.62]Clues?
[246:38.14]Hmm?
[246:39.32]Ooh, okay, maybe I don't need a clue.
[246:41.19]Music change.
[246:42.73]Where is he?
[246:51.57]You heard it.
[246:55.47]What's going on here?
[247:00.69]Why would you still be here?
[247:01.67]Why wouldn't you leave?
[247:09.76]There's actually no reason to still be hanging out here.
[247:11.66]I feel like I'm being stalked.
[247:20.33]Make sure my horses are on.
[247:27.35]God damn it.
[247:32.25]We're just going to go across.
[247:36.35]I feel like that noise means I was close.
[247:41.17]I mean, I have to be close.
[247:42.15]Where is he?
[247:42.91]He's over here.
[247:43.55]Where?
[247:44.43]Where are you?
[247:47.24]He's hiding in a bush.
[247:56.00]There he is.
[248:06.46]Okay.
[248:06.56]Bloody hoof pick.
[248:08.96]Someone in Niof must know more about it.
[248:35.70]And then three, two, one.
[248:42.13]Right, did I say it all?
[248:44.63]Search the bandit.
[248:45.49]Yeah.
[248:46.51]Find the owner of the hoof pick.
[248:49.41]Let's go.
[248:53.97]Explore the clearing woods.
[248:54.95]We did it.
[248:56.51]Here we go.
[248:58.31]Back to town.
[249:04.45]And learn some more horsemanship.
[249:05.95]Nice.
[249:08.80]Pretty good weaving through the trees.
[249:10.32]If I do say so myself.
[249:12.30]Jump!
[249:14.44]Ah, that could use a little work.
[249:17.70]Oh.
[249:19.92]I still got it.
[249:20.54]Alright, who owns this?
[249:31.98]Do you own this?
[249:33.32]Is this yours?
[249:34.57]Have you seen this?
[249:40.37]Hey.
[249:41.45]I got something for you.
[249:43.41]Whose is this?
[249:43.93]Because he's the bad guy.
[249:44.65]But he...
[249:58.86]I should have killed him when I had the chance.
[250:01.79]Oh man, we had an opportunity there.
[250:30.28]Oh well.
[250:32.90]We talked to him.
[250:33.44]He was over here.
[250:34.20]He was playing the inside man the whole time.
[250:37.74]Mm-hmm.
[250:55.24]Yep.
[250:55.94]But did he kill somebody else too?
[250:57.74]Wait.
[250:59.01]Who's this?
[251:02.38]How could anyone be so cruel?
[251:06.65]Alright, let's close the case.
[251:08.37]Go find him.
[251:11.59]Hello.
[251:12.85]Hi.
[251:14.03]Where's your friend?
[251:18.78]Do you know anything about this hoof pick?
[251:20.70]Oh, whoops.
[251:21.04]Yeah, it's Ginger's.
[251:23.82]He had it made in Mate.
[251:27.40]Any idea where I might find this, Ginger?
[251:29.71]Well, that's the thing.
[251:32.49]He packed up and left.
[251:33.91]What?
[251:36.09]Look, I know how he looks.
[251:39.07]But Ginger is a fine fellow.
[251:41.57]I don't believe he had anything to do with the attack.
[251:44.18]Well, he did.
[251:45.50]Where could he have fled to?
[251:46.70]He did.
[251:47.36]I know it.
[251:48.02]I am a detective.
[251:50.40]You've got to promise me one thing.
[251:52.76]When you find him, listen to what he has to say before judging.
[252:00.25]Okay.
[252:00.75]You have my word.
[252:01.55]I'll hear what he has to say.
[252:03.21]Judge first, then listen.
[252:04.17]Somebody ran by.
[252:04.55]That was a late actor getting to his next position for the next scene.
[252:08.49]And he got on camera.
[252:09.67]Fun movie facts.
[252:30.87]Weird, 25 weird movie mistakes that you didn't catch the first time through.
[252:37.63]If you can see this extra runs right by the scene.
[252:42.56]Did you blink?
[252:43.50]You may have missed it.
[252:44.30]We're going to slow it down and show you.
[252:46.96]So if I go through the woods along running water, I'll find them.
[252:51.30]Exactly.
[252:58.39]Horse inventory.
[252:59.73]I know.
[253:00.21]I'm gonna do the horse inventory.
[253:02.35]Watch.
[253:03.43]Come on over here, Dandy.
[253:11.15]What?
[253:14.13]Horse.
[253:16.75]Okay, move to horse.
[253:18.83]Bacon.
[253:19.71]No, keep the bandages.
[253:21.57]Boar hide.
[253:22.99]Eat the bread.
[253:27.22]Uh, brown hat.
[253:28.08]Brown hose.
[253:30.98]Is that better than what I currently have on?
[253:34.62]No.
[253:35.60]Put the sword in there.
[253:36.32]Put the cheap wine in there.
[253:40.31]Put the goblet in there.
[253:43.19]Let's have a drink.
[253:45.91]Put the water in there.
[253:46.71]We got $511.
[253:48.75]Wow.
[253:49.91]Put the hair meat in there.
[253:50.89]Put it all in there.
[253:51.76]Absolutely.
[253:52.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[253:57.14]I'm wearing this shit.
[254:01.19]A nettle in there.
[254:03.89]It's not nighttime.
[254:04.63]I don't need it.
[254:05.17]Armor.
[254:08.21]Please wear the pants instead of selling them.
[254:11.15]You mean these things?
[254:13.61]Sure thing.
[254:17.41]I have better stuff now.
[254:18.40]Hold on.
[254:23.12]This is better than what I was using.
[254:25.08]Sturdy gambeson.
[254:28.72]What's worse?
[254:32.02]This is 9.
[254:33.06]Yeah, I know this thing.
[254:34.32]Move this to the horse.
[254:38.28]This one is 55.
[254:39.02]It's alright.
[254:44.68]Alright, let's go.
[254:47.44]Got pants on now, guys.
[254:50.22]I know, it's shocking.
[254:52.61]Alright, where are we going?
[254:53.25]We're going, uh, to... Oh, whoa, we're going down.
[254:56.97]Very far down.
[254:58.31]Question the charcoal burners in the south.
[255:04.17]Okay, we got all... We're moving around a lot.
[255:08.77]Looks like we're just gonna ride off into the mist.
[255:11.27]Question the charcoal burners.
[255:12.41]Let's just go.
[255:16.83]How the fuck do you get perfect Jupiters every time, Etalyx?
[255:21.85]You're like the only person I think that knows how to do that.
[255:23.83]Like, every time gets it right every time.
[255:27.28]I don't think I've ever seen you not get one.
[255:30.66]You get it every time.
[255:35.92]You just hit perfect Jupiter's.
[255:37.30]I didn't put on the shoes.
[255:38.88]I got the shoes on.
[255:45.03]Oh, wait a minute.
[255:45.69]He's right.
[255:46.03]I didn't.
[255:46.27]I'm just wearing socks.
[255:50.54]They're both the same.
[255:51.36]These ones are so expensive, but I can't... Is there like some seedy underbelly vendor that eventually you can sell stolen stuff to?
[256:05.99]Shortcut.
[256:16.42]Through the poppies.
[256:19.92]Another one.
[256:25.17]Nice.
[256:25.49]Nice, you got one.
[256:33.42]Having the horse is so much better.
[256:34.54]Being able to travel this fast.
[256:37.54]It's just wonderful every time.
[256:42.62]No more running, no more walking.
[256:44.06]It's perfect.
[256:50.45]alright let's go talk got a camp here and let's not be threatening howdy how are you the spokesman god be with you uh I need help looking for somebody please depends what you want doesn't it I'm looking for ginger a stable boy from neuhoff
[257:17.20]They say he ran away and joined up with some charcoal burners he used to hang around with sometimes.
[257:21.02]Lies.
[257:21.58]We're gonna use our speech here.
[257:33.19]A murder's been committed at Neuhof, and that boy likely knows who did it.
[257:36.58]It's vital I find him.
[257:38.10]There's been murder aplenty in these parts of late.
[257:41.18]But that ginger lad really hasn't been here.
[257:43.42]There'll be a lot less murdering going on once I bring those bastards to justice.
[257:47.00]So how about helping me out?
[257:47.90]I'm gonna kill this guy.
[257:48.56]Calm down, lad.
[257:49.46]No, never mind.
[257:50.46]He lives.
[257:51.26]There's been no one like the boy you want around here.
[257:53.84]But then again, there are other charcoal burners.
[257:56.62]Try them.
[257:57.70]You might want to hurry.
[257:58.88]Not a fail.
[257:59.54]You're not the first to be asking about him.
[258:01.92]And the others weren't exactly a noble-looking bunch.
[258:05.52]Although they were generous with their silver.
[258:08.17]Am I going to get paid off?
[258:10.75]I'll take money.
[258:11.37]I don't even care.
[258:13.55]I need it badly.
[258:17.15]Do you have any idea where else he could have gone?
[258:19.51]You said he was friends with the charcoal burners?
[258:22.49]Well, you'll definitely find some in the forest.
[258:25.11]I'm going to go to the forest.
[258:27.27]There's good spots around there.
[258:28.81]But that forest is huge.
[258:30.37]I could spend weeks searching.
[258:32.03]Then follow the river.
[258:33.41]That's how you found us, isn't it?
[258:35.92]Where there's charcoal burners, there's always water nearby.
[258:40.04]Okay.
[258:41.02]Alright, I'll go now somewhere else.
[258:42.64]See you later.
[258:43.08]Thanks for the help.
[258:43.76]I appreciate it.
[258:44.96]Don't look while I take a bunch of stuff that you own and call it mine now.
[258:51.21]You have nothing.
[258:51.83]Oh, charcoal burners.
[258:53.01]You guys are just shoveling dirt.
[258:57.45]Oh.
[258:57.81]Huh.
[258:58.29]No, I don't even need it.
[259:01.47]Horse!
[259:03.03]Let's go.
[259:03.37]Easy.
[259:13.58]Easy.
[259:17.31]I know one of these times I'm gonna fall down one of these slight ledges and my horse's legs are all gonna break.
[259:21.61]It's gonna be real sad.
[259:27.18]What are you doing?
[259:30.58]You couldn't jump over that?
[259:33.08]Yes you can.
[259:45.11]We're good.
[259:50.25]Everything's fine.
[259:52.69]Use the rope.
[259:53.11]Why would I use the rope when there's such a direct straight arrow that I can go and save like a full minute?
[260:05.00]This is the fastest way to go.
[260:07.62]Straight line.
[260:08.60]Just dodge the trees.
[260:12.56]See?
[260:23.16]Perfectly executed jump.
[260:24.77]Wait a minute.
[260:25.05]What are these horses?
[260:25.67]Can I steal them?
[260:27.05]Oh, wait a minute.
[260:27.51]Sorry, Pebbles.
[260:28.17]I'm going to have to skin you for meat.
[260:31.33]What do we got?
[260:32.85]Oh, you're better.
[260:33.48]You're better at everything.
[260:34.70]Okay.
[260:35.36]Look left.
[260:36.86]Look right.
[260:40.10]I don't see anyone.
[260:42.41]We're getting to be a little bit at dusk.
[260:50.76]Do I... Okay, hold on.
[260:52.18]Do I get... to keep... Do I have to take all the shit out of this horse's inventory, or does it transition?
[261:05.49]I have to take it all off.
[261:09.25]Don't do it.
[261:11.56]Keep him.
[261:12.12]What, you want me to keep him?
[261:15.46]Keep Pebble?
[261:16.16]But this horse is like three times better!
[261:17.90]Fine.
[261:28.88]Anyone want some popcorn?
[261:31.10]Alright, I'll keep pebbles.
[261:32.04]Okay.
[261:33.74]Alright, I'll keep... Okay.
[261:45.51]You can't call a stolen horse.
[261:48.56]Interesting.
[261:48.96]Okay, that's good to know.
[261:59.25]Very good.
[262:01.29]Now where are those charcoal burners?
[262:06.17]Through the woods.
[262:06.71]Alright, come on.
[262:08.99]I know you can hold up.
[262:21.07]Not even a scratch.
[262:22.95]Perfect.
[262:24.43]Perfect timing.
[262:25.67]Excellent work.
[262:28.23]Alright, where are they?
[262:30.65]They're just along the river somewhere here.
[262:37.68]I'm gonna have to go up and then down.
[262:42.67]Anybody?
[262:44.41]Nobody?
[262:46.77]Down along the river.
[262:54.42]Alright, let me just get a good... Okay, we're gonna turn.
[262:56.71]We're gonna go down.
[262:58.51]Just ride down until we find somebody.
[263:00.15]It's a camp right there, right?
[263:05.39]There we go.
[263:11.64]Hi!
[263:13.66]I'm looking for somebody.
[263:20.56]People?
[263:22.53]Workers?
[263:25.68]I don't see anybody.
[263:26.46]Do I have to wait till, like, dawn or something?
[263:28.18]Oh, they're sleeping.
[263:29.62]Alright, I'm gonna wait.
[263:34.45]Let's wake them up.
[263:40.91]Fine.
[263:42.95]Is there an empty cabin in here?
[263:44.49]But you all both have...
[263:53.73]Where can I sleep?
[263:55.71]Can I just sleep outside on the ground?
[263:59.99]Is there no sleep here?
[264:01.85]Sleep.
[264:02.51]No, I'll wait.
[264:06.04]What time is it?
[264:08.18]Oh, fuck.
[264:25.63]Well, thanks to the apples.
[264:28.39]Time to wait.
[264:29.47]Let's wait.
[264:30.17]Oh, man.
[264:35.72]I got to wait like 10 hours.
[264:43.60]What if I do this?
[264:44.16]What if I shoot an arrow like over there above him?
[264:46.08]You know what I'm saying?
[264:52.94]Like, if I aim an arrow and I... Will it wake him up if I put the thing away?
[265:09.51]Okay.
[265:11.53]Talk.
[265:23.43]Sleep!
[265:24.89]Got it.
[265:43.26]Fuck, I'm at this middle of the night.
[265:44.66]Can I add time to sleep?
[265:51.92]Oh, goddammit.
[265:53.93]I need to sleep until like six.
[266:01.93]Yeah, we're fine.
[266:02.51]Is that the spokesperson?
[266:03.49]No.
[266:04.61]Go back to bed.
[266:15.02]I just need to wake up and check my surroundings, make sure I was okay.
[266:24.74]It was a bear.
[266:29.06]Alright.
[266:30.50]Now they should be awake.
[266:32.26]He had an arrow in him?
[266:33.26]No, he did not.
[266:36.40]He did not have an arrow in him.
[266:38.11]I didn't hit the guy.
[266:38.99]I purposely missed.
[266:41.35]To make sure I wasn't going to get anybody in trouble.
[266:45.13]Alright.
[266:46.75]Everyone's up.
[266:49.35]There we are.
[266:50.03]Hey!
[266:51.72]Are you a spokesperson?
[266:53.48]No, where's the spokesperson?
[266:57.97]No.
[266:58.71]Where is he?
[266:59.25]He's still asleep.
[267:01.35]God damn it.
[267:01.85]Where's the spokesperson?
[267:03.79]Does it matter who you talk to?
[267:05.21]I guess not.
[267:12.66]I'm searching for a stable boy from Neuhof.
[267:14.82]They call him Ginger.
[267:16.16]I know him right now, but I don't know where he is now.
[267:19.28]He's run away from the stud farm.
[267:20.74]I have to find him.
[267:21.98]Well, he's definitely not here.
[267:23.56]Try the other charcoal burners camp downstream.
[267:26.84]Maybe he's there.
[267:29.82]find look for the look at the other one downstream really oh this is so okay good day to you what do you need is anyone here that boy from the stud where is he is he around now he's not here but he passed through not long ago on the way to town follow the stream to the west thank you
[267:58.34]Thank you.
[268:00.46]Follow the stream to the west.
[268:03.44]Hey, speaking of following streams, if you're having a good time here, you know what to do.
[268:10.62]Okay, let's go down here.
[268:15.84]Just gotta go straight.
[268:22.10]Next camp.
[268:24.18]I'll find him.
[268:40.70]Where's the other camp?
[268:52.65]Get out of the way, tree.
[268:59.81]Come on, where's the other camp?
[269:01.27]I need it.
[269:12.25]Get back on the road!
[269:24.50]Um... Found a nest.
[269:28.70]That's not... Don't... Get my hopes up like that.
[269:32.00]Is that a camp down there?
[269:45.43]I can't tell.
[269:48.04]Well, apparently not.
[269:49.08]Apparently I went too far.
[269:51.30]No, is that it right there?
[269:53.10]It's out of the zone, though.
[269:56.56]It's not in the quest zone.
[269:58.04]My World of Warcraft quest tracker is incorrect, apparently.
[270:00.57]Hi.
[270:04.97]Looking for a boy.
[270:12.33]I'm looking for Ginger, a stable boy from Neuhof.
[270:15.13]Don't know him.
[270:17.14]But they told me at the other camp that he comes to visit you.
[270:19.90]Well, they must have got themselves in a muddle.
[270:22.48]Liar.
[270:23.18]Definitely.
[270:24.70]Isn't that the same dude from the first?
[270:27.72]This is the same guy.
[270:28.72]What's hiding him here?
[270:31.38]He's in one of these caves.
[270:32.27]He's in one of these fucking termite hills.
[270:35.03]Hey, shh.
[270:36.77]Come here.
[270:38.03]I know something.
[270:39.03]Do you?
[270:42.52]Asshole.
[270:43.10]Of course.
[270:45.28]More than 30.
[271:12.18]Oh my God, come on now.
[271:13.94]30.5.
[271:17.72]Not bad, not bad.
[271:20.66]Listen up.
[271:22.58]Oh, that was easy.
[271:24.05]Twins who are keeping him hidden and taking care of him.
[271:27.71]They go out every day to bring him something to eat.
[271:30.25]Where do they take the food?
[271:32.57]I don't know.
[271:33.41]I didn't follow them.
[271:35.13]Why would I?
[271:39.35]That's all you have?
[271:41.33]That's what I paid so much silver for.
[271:43.33]If you'd already known that much, you wouldn't be here talking to me.
[271:47.05]So I reckon you got your money's worth.
[271:51.87]Okay, so there's two twins.
[272:02.79]What did he say?
[272:03.49]There's two twins keeping him?
[272:06.03]This guy right here?
[272:10.18]My respects to you.
[272:11.39]Okay, so, you're dead.
[272:15.69]Just, we're gonna go, matter of fact.
[272:17.93]Where are you hiding, Ginger?
[272:20.15]How did you- What the hell are you talking about?
[272:22.95]Don't try that one on me.
[272:24.37]I know he's friends with a pair of twins from here.
[272:26.91]I'm here on the orders of Sir Hanush, and I need to talk to Ginger about the raid on the stud farm.
[272:31.36]If Sir Hanush sent you, then you should deal with those two cutthroats who've been creeping around here asking about the poor boy.
[272:37.82]Once you take care of them, we won't have to hide him anymore.
[272:45.38]Kill the bandits.
[272:46.02]Yeah, they're already done.
[272:47.94]They were easy.
[272:48.60]I'll take your word for it.
[273:05.96]Ruined hut not far from here.
[273:07.94]Here we go.
[273:08.36]Uh oh.
[273:08.72]Off we go.
[273:09.10]I should put an arrow on this guy's head.
[273:34.63]Oh no, I am on a mission from the Lord himself.
[273:39.51]I need to do at least half these missions... well.
[273:45.69]Without any bullshit, no messing around.
[273:47.61]I need to be a man of the king.
[273:50.29]And that entails trying to make amends and to get nice killstreaks.
[274:00.48]Can I whistle like that in real life?
[274:01.80]No, I don't know how to whistle.
[274:07.43]I just learned how to whistle right now on stream.
[274:10.01]I swear to god I've never known how to do that in my entire life since I was like two.
[274:16.50]I- I can't- I just learned how to whistle right now.
[274:18.22]I- I can't whistle!
[274:19.18]Why am I- No, whatever.
[274:43.83]Found it.
[274:48.03]Hey.
[274:50.11]How are you?
[274:52.65]It's not my fault.
[274:54.07]There was nothing I could have done to help.
[274:56.09]I was frozen solid.
[274:57.57]I couldn't even open my mouth.
[274:59.60]I couldn't even get a peep out.
[275:01.22]They would have killed me if I'd said anything.
[275:03.50]I couldn't stop what happened.
[275:04.90]I'm not to blame.
[275:06.20]Right.
[275:07.66]Anything else?
[275:20.99]Jesus, you've led me a merry dance.
[275:24.27]What do you want from me?
[275:25.97]I want to ask you a question.
[275:29.21]I want some money.
[275:30.55]Where are your cronies?
[275:31.59]And why did you kill that bandit?
[275:33.73]What?
[275:35.19]Right, one thing at a time.
[275:40.48]Why did you... Where are your cronies?
[275:42.90]I'm looking for your friends.
[275:44.00]Where are they?
[275:45.44]Charcoal burners?
[275:46.60]They're over at the... To hell with the charcoal burners.
[275:49.38]Where are your bandit mates?
[275:51.54]They're not my mates.
[275:53.20]They nearly killed me.
[275:54.35]I recognized one of them, so I thought they'd come back.
[275:57.25]Recognized?
[275:58.51]Who was it?
[275:59.27]Talk.
[276:00.73]I don't know his name, only that he's from Ushets and he has a limp.
[276:06.51]Okay.
[276:07.81]What can you tell me about him?
[276:09.01]How do you know him?
[276:09.99]I saw him a few times in the tavern in Ushets.
[276:14.07]We got a lead.
[276:15.07]And...
[276:17.06]I know he lives in a house on the edge of the village, but that's all I know.
[276:21.12]I never talked to him.
[276:22.26]Okay, why did you run?
[276:24.94]Why did you run off in such a hurry?
[276:27.68]Because I was afraid they'd come back and kill me.
[276:30.02]Who?
[276:30.84]Who?
[276:31.36]Who could do such a thing?
[276:32.78]Those bandits, of course.
[276:34.16]To get revenge on you for killing their mate.
[276:36.46]Killing?
[276:37.46]Me?
[276:38.60]I never killed anyone.
[276:40.14]God is my witness.
[276:41.20]Those are big hands for quite a lie you did there.
[276:44.34]And now tell me exactly what happened.
[276:46.42]And don't leave anything out.
[276:48.86]That's quite a long story.
[276:53.96]You don't have to tell me everything.
[276:55.46]Just who they were and where they went.
[276:56.64]Tell me the whole thing.
[276:57.36]Just kidding.
[276:57.96]Give me the bullet points.
[276:59.62]A fellow from Ushits with a limp.
[277:02.06]He lives in a house.
[277:02.92]We're getting the same song and dance.
[277:04.46]He's in the tavern there whenever he has the coin.
[277:06.84]What else do you know?
[277:09.00]Nothing.
[277:10.02]That's all.
[277:10.56]Good.
[277:13.84]I've heard everything I need to hear, so I'll leave you be.
[277:15.78]Help you out.
[277:16.56]I will help you.
[277:17.40]I can help you, yes.
[277:34.19]I can help you.
[277:34.85]Yeah, I will help you.
[277:35.91]Um, okay.
[278:01.28]He's sitting very strangely for your ultimate demise.
[278:07.41]Pay no attention to this.
[278:12.69]So, I'd like to... Okay, we can't... I don't think I can kill him with this.
[278:19.53]He's apparently... He's not concerned at all.
[278:23.81]What is...
[278:30.51]That went through his mouth.
[278:32.45]That actually went through his face.
[278:42.17]I can't kill him.
[278:45.57]He can't even be killed.
[278:48.95]Is that some new kind of game?
[278:52.13]Oh, come on, I can't knock him out.
[278:54.60]Come on, game.
[278:56.16]Really?
[278:58.03]It's a new game.
[278:58.71]Yeah, it's called Lights Out.
[279:00.97]Give me my arrows back.
[279:04.55]What's the matter, laddie?
[279:05.63]Need a shit?
[279:06.39]What the hell?
[279:09.03]Give me the arrow.
[279:10.09]It's broken now.
[279:10.95]What the hell?
[279:15.33]Alright, I, uh, unfortunately... I... I have to... I have to stop streaming.
[279:26.36]It is 9.45.
[279:27.68]I need to go... Actually, I might be able to get one last thing done here.
[279:35.17]Back to A. Can I fast travel back here?
[279:38.15]I can.
[279:40.23]Can we back it up a little bit, though?
[279:44.95]Yeah, I gotta just go tell what I know.
[279:47.82]Why is this still... Oh, kill the bandits.
[279:49.42]I could kill the... I don't have enough... I don't think I can kill the bandits.
[279:54.13]I don't have enough time, unfortunately.
[279:56.34]We have to skip the bandit killing.
[280:02.40]I need to save it and start the wind down for the stream because I have to go pick up Kim.
[280:11.49]I gotta pick up Kimberly.
[280:16.49]You forgot the horse.
[280:18.85]Doesn't the horse just keep going?
[280:21.43]I'll see you tomorrow.
[280:22.57]We'll be playing this tomorrow again.
[280:24.15]I need to sleep in a bed.
[280:28.39]Do I have a bed like here?
[280:32.76]No, I don't think so.
[280:33.50]I've been at the airport for hours.
[280:39.36]Let's just complete the quest and then I'm going to start the end of the stream.
[280:42.34]Tomorrow I'm going to be starting around the same time, probably like 5 o'clock.
[280:44.49]Shut up.
[280:46.45]There you are.
[280:54.03]I'm going to keep going with Kingdom Come.
[280:58.27]I have opened up the game.
[281:00.35]And it has... The difference between last night and tonight is staggering.
[281:12.06]So, I'm enjoying the game as we speak, right?
[281:21.50]Here we go.
[281:22.89]Well, well.
[281:24.57]Look who deigns to grace us with his presence.
[281:27.41]What do you think I was doing?
[281:28.17]I was looking for that boy and... I did a whole thing.
[281:30.38]And you didn't bother telling anyone.
[281:32.54]I had to follow the trail before it went cold.
[281:34.85]And what if some bandit skewered you and left you for dead?
[281:38.27]Well, they didn't.
[281:39.21]I kicked all their asses.
[281:39.99]Because you told no one where you were going.
[281:42.09]How would I explain that to Sir Radzig, eh?
[281:45.04]I really don't know, my lord.
[281:47.16]He disappeared without saying a word.
[281:49.96]Smell you later.
[281:51.28]Yeah, we'll be doing it tomorrow.
[281:53.64]I want to do another, like, four, five, six hour stream tomorrow, too.
[281:56.70]Silence!
[281:57.94]Keep your ignorant mouth shut when I'm giving you the benefit of a veteran's wisdom.
[282:02.62]you do what I tell you answer only when I ask and not go roaming off whenever you feel like it uh PlayStation 1 we still got it back to the castle and be sure I got a lot more to do on that but I want to kind of get my fill of this game who knows nothing about soldiering and it's my job to whip you into
[282:18.76]I just did a massive detective job and found this guy.
[282:21.67]I should kill this dude.
[282:22.71]If I get my way, an arrow goes into your head.
[282:24.35]Out with it, then.
[282:48.34]Save and kill him.
[282:48.74]Go to Užič.
[282:49.00]Um... I need help.
[283:19.25]Just get it prepared.
[283:20.65]Oh, god damn it.
[283:21.41]No, I... No, I'm not ready for this.
[283:23.31]I have to then lead the way.
[283:24.81]And I'm about to go on... I'm about to leave.
[283:45.87]What is going on?
[283:47.73]What is?
[283:49.71]Huh?
[283:50.67]We found them.
[283:51.67]We found the bandits.
[283:53.77]Found the bandits.
[283:58.79]Good thing this was a fast forward quest.
[284:00.85]Okay.
[284:03.13]Did it.
[284:22.67]I'm not gonna get in trouble for that, right?
[284:23.71]What?
[284:24.31]That's a silver ring I just picked up.
[284:26.89]Where's the other guy?
[284:27.97]You disposed of that other guy already?
[284:31.09]What do you have?
[284:32.62]Quick, before he gets anything!
[284:52.99]I think I got it all.
[284:55.63]Alright, I need to go back.
[284:59.15]We need to... I need to get out of here.
[285:03.84]Gonna have to take a... I need a bed.
[285:07.06]Where's the nearest bed?
[285:07.94]Do I have to go back here?
[285:09.21]This is my bed.
[285:11.23]Yeah, I gotta fast travel.
[285:12.05]I'm not gonna fail any... I'm too overburdened.
[285:14.75]Fuck.
[285:16.48]Can I just save right here?
[285:17.44]I don't have anything.
[285:18.18]I don't have any schnapps.
[285:20.72]Fuck.
[285:22.56]Wait, did it just save?
[285:23.24]I was looking over here at chat.
[285:25.72]I didn't see.
[285:26.50]Okay, that's fine.
[285:28.74]Alright.
[285:32.50]Let's steal another bed.
[285:35.32]Alright, guys.
[285:36.36]I will see you tomorrow.
[285:42.22]Probably around the same time.
[285:45.11]Now, before you leave, hold on just a second.
[285:48.31]What do we got here?
[285:49.05]Look at this.
[285:54.09]Um, yep.

[291:08.70]He's got a family.
[291:09.36]He's got two children.
[291:10.32]He's got a house and a wife.
[291:12.28]He's like a full-blown burger adult now.
[291:14.39]He's no longer a Burgah Boy.

[291:47.90]I would love to meet you one day and shake your hand.
[291:50.12]As would I to you, David.
[291:52.36]Thank you so much for your 10 bucks.

[291:57.69]Shake the hand.
[291:58.89]And talk about video games.

[292:09.49]Yes, he is.
[292:11.41]Cookie.
[292:12.55]CookieCRM gave the 50 bucks earlier.
[292:14.39]Talking about statues.
[292:15.25]We touched upon it.
[292:16.29]Thank you so much, dude.
[292:17.49]$50 is a lot of money.
[292:18.99]Bob the Pineapple, thanks for the $1.
[292:20.39]I think we got these during the time when the clock was spinning.
[292:24.20]We did, but, you know.
[292:25.52]Thank you, Ivory, for the 50 cents.
[292:26.70]And before Jerma kills the nobleman and not realizing he's trying to romance you.
[292:30.28]It seems good.
[292:31.10]I probably... I just read it so fast, I don't even remember what it was.
[292:35.19]Son of Jenova, thanks for the two bucks.
[292:36.81]Appreciate it.
[292:38.11]I still have nightmares with your nose hair story.
[292:40.15]Do you really have hairs that grow through your nose to the outside of it?
[292:42.65]Because that's gross as fuck.
[292:43.67]I still love you, though.
[292:44.31]Yes.
[292:45.92]I don't know what it is about the way my nose hairs grow.
[292:48.74]But when I... If I trim my nose hairs, if I cut them too short, I will get an ingrown nose hair inside my nostril.
[292:56.61]And over two weeks, I get this awful, painful bubble on the front of my nose, and the hair grows through the front of my nose.
[293:05.71]It is awful.
[293:07.03]It is life-ruining.
[293:08.29]It's happened like three times now.
[293:10.25]It's terrible.
[293:12.29]Thanks, though.
[293:13.85]Thank you, Soup or Seal.
[293:17.45]Some guy on Reddit claimed to go to the same school as you.
[293:20.39]And he also said you once came to school dressed as Super Mario for no reason.
[293:23.07]Is this true?
[293:23.53]Yes.
[293:24.68]Yes, it is.
[293:26.03]uh Justin vk thanks for the 25 cents looking forward to Jerma blocks maybe one day cookie crm thanks for the another 11 dollars here Jerma how do I stop throwing money at you I think I have a problem well you've given enough you've given enough you've given like you've given like a more money than I could possibly want one person to give
[293:48.28]You don't have to do it anymore.
[293:49.38]If you got to the threshold where it's like, there it is, I'm at the threshold of, like, most money that I could possibly give to, like, Jerma the streamer.
[293:56.96]Thank you.
[293:57.92]I really appreciate it, dude.
[293:59.04]You're giving me a lot of money.
[294:01.25]So there.
[294:01.65]There you go.
[294:02.11]Stop it.
[294:02.83]Stop doing that.
[294:03.81]Don't do it anymore.
[294:06.47]Well, you know, what if you do?
[294:09.30]Just kidding.
[294:10.40]Thank you, Never Trust Purple, for the 10 bucks, Purple.
[294:12.76]Hi, Purple.
[294:13.20]Thanks, Purple.
[294:14.33]Jerma, you're acting like an impatient child on Christmas morning, waiting to go down and open your presents, but your parents won't let you even know it's a light out.
[294:23.44]Don't bring back bad memories for me.
[294:26.36]My dog peed on my PlayStation 2 one time, and it wasn't a lie.
[294:29.29]I actually had to go in and re-wrap it, and they thought I did it on purpose.
[294:33.99]My dog at the time pissed on a PlayStation 2 that was under the tree.
[294:38.01]I unwrapped it.
[294:38.76]It was a PlayStation 2.
[294:39.62]I was like, fuck, but I had to re-wrap it because there was piss on it, and I thought it was going to break.
[294:43.74]And they saw the shitty re-wrap job because obviously I was a kid.
[294:46.72]And that was a true story.
[294:49.87]I swear to God.
[294:51.89]Thank you.
[294:52.33]Mostly lost for the one buck.
[294:53.81]Jerma, turn on the archery aim dot.
[294:55.43]I'm not sure how you do it, but you might actually get within three feet if you do.
[295:00.58]And then Ace McLace with the $250.
[295:02.18]Thank you so much.
[295:05.70]We already touched upon it, but that's a fucking lot of money, dude.
[295:09.06]If you're still here, if you're still watching, best of luck to you.
[295:11.27]Much love.
[295:13.21]Thank you.
[295:14.68]Mr. Fancy, thanks for the $1 testing.
[295:16.54]Can I bypass emote-only chat with bits?
[295:18.70]Yes, you can.
[295:19.20]You've got to pay money to bypass emote-only mode.
[295:22.72]What a sellout.
[295:23.66]What a piece of garbage.
[295:24.72]What a loser.
[295:25.93]Bad streamer.
[295:27.15]Bad, bad, bad.

[295:35.82]Grizzly, 16, 20, thanks for the $1.
[295:37.28]Seeing as you now have given, I've given 5,000 bits, I now hold a share of your life.
[295:41.32]As a shareholder, I'd like to request that you get a tattoo on your forehead of your own face.
[295:46.57]50 bucks, 5,000 bits, you're talking about like, add like 20, at least like 10 zeros there.
[295:54.19]I would never tattoo my face unless it was for like $10 million.
[295:58.15]But thank you, though.
[295:58.83]I appreciate it.
[295:59.43]I do appreciate it.
