[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.40]Hello.
[00:01.58]How you guys doing?
[00:06.12]Welcome back to the stream.
[00:10.94]The stream is currently boppin'.
[00:12.30]I mean, it's on.
[00:14.84]I wouldn't necessarily say the stream is boppin' right now, because... I mean, it's not like anything crazy is happening right now or anything cool.
[00:25.17]I mean, I guess the planets are cool.
[00:29.27]Nobody dancing, though.
[00:30.35]Well, I mean, the J is kind of dancing.
[00:32.39]That's me.
[00:34.03]It's bopping.
[00:36.25]I retract my statement.
[00:39.56]When I say nothing, I mean nothing, like, cool on that.
[00:41.76]This is the starting card.
[00:44.00]And it is cool.
[00:46.68]But I'm talking about, like, nothing cool happened yet on camera.
[00:54.92]End of the pre-stream voice.
[00:56.06]That's, yeah, that's it.
[00:58.89]Moving on to the real thing now.
[00:59.97]No, hope you're doing well.
[01:02.11]Before we get going, I want to talk about a couple things.
[01:03.81]Because they're very important, and it is going to affect the streams.
[01:11.84]And I want to keep you guys in the loop of things, because, you know, that's what we do here.
[01:17.22]So, I am currently on a couple of new medications for my stomach.
[01:25.56]And one of them is...
[01:29.12]kind of hard to manage.
[01:32.26]We'll just put it that way.
[01:35.68]Uh, so, the streams over the next week, there are gonna be more streams, but they are going to be shorter.
[01:47.61]So instead of streaming a few times for six, seven, eight hours, I'm gonna stream more than a few times.
[01:56.22]Like, probably four or five times in a row here.
[01:59.35]But only for like three or four hours at a time.
[02:04.09]So more days, less time.
[02:06.05]Because the medication that I'm on is kind of makes it hard to sit here for more than a few hours at a time.
[02:17.34]It's sort of difficult to do.
[02:19.94]So I figured that's probably a good way to do this.
[02:25.46]We actually like that.
[02:26.36]Well, it's just for this week.
[02:28.10]Because I do like to stream for at least six hours or so.
[02:31.02]And we're going to start with fear.
[02:34.52]Well, not start with.
[02:35.26]I mean, we did horror stuff last week, so... What you can expect over the next week... The original fear...
[02:43.25]is what's going to happen now, and then into tomorrow and the next day or whatever, you know, however we do this, however long it takes to beat Fear.
[02:52.43]I am not going to move on to Fear 2, and I'm not going to move on to Fear 3.
[02:57.27]At least not now.
[02:58.83]I've been told that Fear 2 and Fear 3 are not very good.
[03:04.73]I've heard that Fear 1 is great, but then the other two are really not even close.
[03:13.17]I'm not saying I will not play them on stream.
[03:15.18]They're just not a priority.
[03:18.84]I also have The Thing.
[03:21.56]On PC.
[03:23.02]If you don't know The Thing, it's supposed to be the sequel to the movie.
[03:26.54]I guess.
[03:30.52]It looks like it's gonna be crazy.
[03:32.16]I've never played The Thing.
[03:34.24]I've heard it's wild.
[03:37.48]There's also a couple of PlayStation 2 horror games that I have.
[03:42.06]Which we will, you know, try and mess around with.
[03:46.43]And then there's a bunch of rhythm games.
[03:49.51]And then it's Halloween.
[03:51.69]So that's kind of what you're looking at for the next couple weeks.
[03:59.45]But without further ado, let's get started because I don't want to sit here for more than a few minutes.
[04:04.86]Because I'm kind of up against the clock.
[04:10.39]I will not go into the gritty details on this, but we gotta go.
[04:15.75]You know what I mean?
[04:16.54]We've got to start.
[04:17.34]So, here we go.
[04:21.42]I think the... Is the camera on?
[04:23.78]It's not.
[04:26.94]Why is the camera not on?
[04:30.48]Well, you can see that.
[04:33.06]What the... What the F?
[04:35.80]What the F?
[04:37.62]I really don't want to start saying F-words.
[04:40.08]Like, fuck.
[04:43.18]Did you guys know?
[04:44.38]I didn't even know this.
[04:46.50]I didn't know that you could say the F-word on TV.
[04:50.60]Did you guys know that?
[04:52.96]I thought it was just shit and I didn't think you could say the F-word on TV.
[04:59.95]You could do it once.
[05:01.93]Once over a whole season or just once an episode.
[05:07.42]Do you have to pick the one place you get to use it?
[05:11.04]Once per episode.
[05:16.81]When are they gonna get rid of that?
[05:20.25]I'm just thinking about this right now.
[05:22.95]Like, shit, dick, fuck, asshole.
[05:28.02]Who cares?
[05:32.46]You're like seven-year-old kids and not watching The Sopranos.
[05:36.99]So why... The demographic for these TV shows are for adults.
[05:43.98]We just pretend that adults don't say swears?
[05:48.32]I don't get it.
[05:54.82]The rule is with the boomers.
[05:57.90]Yeah, but what about what your kids might hear?
[06:00.96]Okay, so if I have a DVD player and I put an R-rated movie in my DVD player and I press play and I watch it really loud in my man cave, they're going to hear that too.
[06:10.88]What's the difference?
[06:11.54]It's like it's my house.
[06:14.00]I decide the swears that come through my speakers.
[06:17.12]You know what I mean?
[06:18.86]Like, sure.
[06:20.32]Like, oh, this is mature content in it, right?
[06:23.26]That people do that.
[06:24.46]Why can't I determine the kind of swear words that I have in my house?
[06:30.00]I'm just realizing this right now, that's fucking weird.
[06:35.98]Don't say shit on TV!
[06:37.99]What?
[06:38.43]Why?
[06:38.79]Oh, fucking the world.
[06:40.37]You know what I mean?
[06:43.51]I'm supposed to go.
[06:45.53]Dude, my mom is watching.
[06:48.85]Your mom probably says the word fuck a hundred times a day.
[06:56.52]You're just not in the room.
[06:58.00]You're at school.
[07:01.21]Your mother probably like stubs her toe and is just like, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[07:08.55]And then you walk in, they're like, honey, how was school today?
[07:20.12]I know this because I caught my mother swearing.
[07:27.61]She was making something, she was baking something, and I just heard.
[07:33.26]She didn't know I was in the room.
[07:35.22]This is when I was like, I don't know, I was like 17, 18.
[07:38.60]And I just hear, she didn't know I came in, and I just hear, this fucking recipe is so fucking stupid.
[07:43.25]What the fuck is with this fucking recipe?
[07:45.53]It's fucking stupid.
[07:46.43]And I was like, holy shit, wow.
[07:51.79]And then she turned, it was like, ooh!
[07:58.05]And she was like, sometimes when people get... I gotta go.
[08:00.67]Alright, what am I... Low difficulty.
[08:03.45]Not low.
[08:04.35]Made fun of.
[08:08.24]Not extreme.
[08:09.30]No.
[08:10.36]This guy... Guy.
[08:12.64]This game is like 15 years old.
[08:15.40]Extreme difficulty means it's impossible to beat.
[08:18.78]You die in like one bullet.
[08:19.78]I'm not doing that.
[08:23.87]I'm not doing extreme, no.
[08:25.85]We're gonna do moderate.
[08:27.07]We're gonna do somewhere high increased enemy accuracy and weapon damage recommended for veteran players looking for a challenge.
[08:35.74]Moderate, default enemy accuracy and weapon damage recommended for experienced players.
[08:42.72]Novice and casual, I ain't one of those.
[08:44.42]I'm an experienced player.
[08:47.82]It's too late, there's no confirmation.
[08:49.88]I'm an experienced player.
[08:54.90]I would do high.
[08:55.60]Well, we can change it on the fly, I think.
[08:57.64]Okay, situation.
[08:58.26]A high-level alert has been issued.
[08:59.40]Mission fear teams to report for emergency briefing on the situation.
[09:03.42]You've just been transferred to the unit as a point man.
[09:05.86]This will be your first assignment with fear.
[09:09.85]He's going with two today.
[09:13.49]In 2002, the U.S.
[09:15.79]Army formed a secret unit dedicated to combating paranormal threats to national security.
[09:21.55]The unit was named First Encounter Assault Recon.
[09:29.05]Or for short, an iPad strategy game that just came out on the App Store last week.
[09:35.21]Sierra Entertainment.
[09:36.09]That's an old one.
[09:40.15]Monolith made this.
[09:41.01]That's right.
[09:45.14]This is way too low.
[09:46.00]I can't even hear this.
[09:48.06]Hopefully you can.
[09:48.72]Nope.
[09:54.84]They're the ones that made Shadow of War, by the way.
[09:57.97]It's a great studio.
[10:04.89]That is so small.
[10:07.06]It's an eye exam.
[10:11.28]Hope you guys like the subtitles.
[10:22.50]Pretty good movie sound clip, too.
[10:24.12]We're gonna be criticizing this whole time.
[10:25.81]I hope you understand.
[10:37.19]Grant Goodeve!
[10:38.77]Grant- Wait, the TF2 engineer is in this game?
[10:41.33]Already plus five letter grades.
[10:44.71]Who's the en- Who's the- Who's Grant Goodeve?
[10:52.43]What did I do that for?
[10:59.78]Who's that guy?
[11:03.38]Is he gonna do it to you?
[11:12.19]Oh, that's the ATC of alcohol, tobacco, and cheaters.
[11:18.19]Like, cheating in video games.
[11:19.95]The ATC, I know that one.
[11:33.69]I have to like not laugh today currently got a lot going on down here yes sorry to wake you senator it's about origin what happened there was an uprising fettle has taken command of the prototypes my god we can still resolve this discreetly but we have to move fast
[12:01.23]I don't think so.
[12:01.99]We gotta find- we gotta find Grant Goody.
[12:05.61]Uh, you gotta turn on V-sync.
[12:06.43]That's not looking good.
[12:26.94]Property of Armacham Technology Corporation.
[12:29.69]They're working on a military contract to develop an army of clones that respond to a psychic commander.
[12:34.98]Top secret, of course.
[12:36.58]Fettel is one of the commanders.
[12:38.38]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[12:40.20]That's not Boston.
[12:40.88]What are you talking about?
[12:42.04]Knowledge of the commander.
[12:43.56]That's like Wisconsin.
[13:05.25]Boston?
[13:05.65]Of course.
[13:05.95]Why do I feel like that's the kind of hat a guy at the gym's gonna have on?
[13:48.82]You will be a god among men.
[13:59.73]Okay.
[13:59.99]Car, plus one letter grade.
[14:01.99]No sign of enemy activity on the satellite, but don't take any chances.
[14:05.65]Jankowski, you in position?
[14:06.98]Just say the word.
[14:08.44]Alright, move it out.
[14:11.01]Situation.
[14:11.57]Fear mission coordinator Rowdy Betters has tracked enemy commander Paxton Fettel to an abandoned building in Auburn District.
[14:20.55]Hannibal 3 spy satellite in geosynchronous orbit shows no signs of replica soldiers in vicinity.
[14:28.21]Fear combat operatives will infiltrate target site from two separate entry points and attempt to neutralize Fettel.
[14:34.59]According to Armacham, technical advisor, once Fettel is contained, replica soldiers will become inactive and can be rounded up without incident.
[14:44.00]Investigate area for signs of Paxton Fettel.
[14:46.64]I could have just read that part.
[14:51.90]Let's turn the volume up a little bit.
[14:59.14]Okay.
[15:01.03]Let's make it a little louder.
[15:04.45]I came in here earlier.
[15:06.75]I'm trying to make it a nice level for you guys.
[15:09.76]I don't want you to have your ears hurt.
[15:15.43]Okay.
[15:17.75]And yes, I did get the... I got the 90 FOV changer.
[15:22.57]So this should be at a good FOV.
[15:24.25]Alright, do I have a map?
[15:25.13]What do I got?
[15:25.57]A gun?
[15:26.61]That's very loud.
[15:27.61]That's so loud that I may have just scared the shit out of a lot of you.
[15:31.83]And I'm gonna change that now.
[15:40.13]That was an explosion.
[15:43.70]That to me is the... Hearing that and how scary that was and how fucking abrupt it was.
[15:49.41]It's like... What did you put in the microwave that exploded?
[15:53.27]Like how long did you leave the bag of popcorn in there for?
[15:55.29]Alright, how do I crouch?
[16:03.16]Okay, made it.
[16:04.30]C. C and then it's... I guess I could shoot it too.
[16:07.64]Do you have infinity ammo?
[16:11.38]Yeah, you just sprint normally.
[16:12.52]Alright, so let's go.
[16:13.12]We gotta get in here.
[16:13.85]Okay, nope.
[16:20.77]We go this way.
[16:24.51]Thank god I could put toggle on.
[16:25.93]I did that before we started.
[16:29.66]Press use to open doors or activate objects.
[16:31.86]Alright, so use...
[16:35.46]Really?
[16:35.74]Okay, I thought I was just- I was about to make a joke about me being on fire, but you can catch fire.
[16:40.65]Good to know.
[16:41.23]Tutorial.
[16:41.59]Wait, anything over here?
[16:51.57]Fuck!
[16:56.28]What the fuck are you doing?
[16:57.50]Wait, is it back for, like, vengeance?
[17:13.57]So I have a flashlight, right?
[17:15.71]Plus V to use flashlight.
[17:18.76]I have a battery in the flashlight, that's great.
[17:21.40]Please help us keep this room clean.
[17:28.68]Hey bro, what took you so long?
[17:35.32]Why'd you punch the glass out?
[17:37.00]Try to find a way around.
[17:39.56]Rendezvous with Jankowski.
[17:41.08]Alright, find a way around.
[17:45.05]Hey, bro.
[17:45.37]What a trash in here.
[17:58.55]Come here, you little fuck!
[18:09.40]Wait, I can slide?
[18:14.83]Holy shit, he exploded!
[18:21.77]Oh man, that was terrib- I- okay.
[18:23.70]I just need to test- it's a tutorial.
[18:25.90]I need to test to see if I can do that stuff.
[18:28.56]Pick up a hammer.
[18:31.16]Wait.
[18:31.80]Oh, what?!
[18:34.11]No!
[18:34.57]I want- I thought it was pick up hammer!
[18:37.61]I can't use hammer?!
[18:40.27]Oh!
[18:44.28]That's a permanent health upgrade.
[18:46.28]I'm assuming it's like Half-Life.
[18:47.44]Come on, open.
[19:03.31]For a space to jump.
[19:05.45]Wait, open it.
[19:07.65]I can't.
[19:12.56]I can't open this.
[19:14.90]Touch door.
[19:15.56]Easter egg.
[19:21.40]I can't, like, fit through that?
[19:24.20]I don't have an... Okay, the print is so small.
[19:27.62]I cannot... I don't see.
[19:29.44]It's like... I have 71 in that... What?
[19:31.38]Alright.
[19:42.71]Alright.
[19:54.96]My accuracy rating is... Oh shit, I can knock him down.
[20:01.55]That's wasting ammo.
[20:02.47]Right, alright, alright, alright.
[20:03.81]Okay, I'm not gonna waste ammo.
[20:06.21]Why'd you bring me here?
[20:07.17]Why'd you bring me back?
[20:20.02]That was a delayed reaction there.
[20:29.73]Alright.
[20:29.97]Weren't we supposed to just go around to find that guy?
[20:33.73]Jankowski?
[20:36.35]Is there ammo anywhere that I should be... Alright, that just... I thought that was somebody coming to get me.
[20:41.48]Shoot the padlock.
[20:42.86]Sure thing.
[20:43.30]First try.
[20:44.60]Ready?
[20:46.66]Shoot the padlock.
[20:50.98]Holy fuck.
[20:51.98]My god.
[21:01.53]Alright, where's Macaulay Culkin?
[21:05.17]Hey, you would have had me.
[21:06.23]You would have killed me right there, Macaulay.
[21:09.65]Didn't saw that one.
[21:12.18]Thin enough.
[21:21.80]Um... Hold on a second.
[21:26.16]I just crashed the game.
[21:28.58]Find a neutralized pack in Federal.
[21:30.08]Go!
[21:34.78]What's going on?
[21:37.04]What happened to you?
[21:38.24]Uh-oh.
[21:42.06]Uh-oh.
[21:45.15]I think that might have just been an Infinity Wars, an endgame Marvel universe happening in the world here.
[21:55.31]There's a spoiler for Infinity Wars.
[21:57.39]This is not even Marvel.
[21:59.39]Forget it.
[22:02.13]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[22:05.79]No, I'm not gonna make that.
[22:07.63]I'm talking to somebody in my earpiece right now.
[22:09.69]For all you know, I could be getting some extremely important info.
[22:34.43]Dude, take a look around.
[22:38.88]Wait, can I hit him in the face?
[22:41.82]What are you, chicken shit or something?
[22:43.60]Look, you're the FNG, so you do as I say.
[22:47.30]What?
[22:48.40]Since when?
[22:49.20]Alright, let's go.
[22:53.77]We have somebody here.
[22:54.35]Alright, we're outside.
[22:59.75]Let's turn the flashlight off.
[23:02.74]I've...
[23:07.99]I'm trying to prove that I can shoot in video games.
[23:11.55]And they're giving me all these fucking stupid little opportunities to show you.
[23:20.94]Give me a light gun.
[23:21.74]I would have had that.
[23:44.45]Okay.
[23:44.95]What about up?
[23:46.31]Maybe up?
[23:49.23]That looks... Can I get in the window?
[23:50.62]Oh, that would hurt so bad.
[23:56.24]No, I want to jump and hit the window.
[24:02.98]Okay, I don't know what I knocked.
[24:04.63]I knocked... Well, I can't get back up there ever again.
[24:07.09]Oh, well.
[24:12.11]These are, like, bored enough.
[24:15.89]I'm making a mountain out of a molehill here.
[24:22.41]I killed him.
[24:22.97]I would have killed him.
[24:28.79]I got him like four times in the chest.
[24:40.13]It makes no difference.
[24:42.58]He deserved to die.
[24:44.60]They all deserved to die.
[24:52.46]Come in.
[24:53.02]Over.
[24:54.00]What's going on?
[24:55.04]At last, fettled signal.
[24:56.30]We joined the team.
[24:58.36]Comcast?
[24:59.24]We've got a situation down at the harbor.
[25:01.38]What kind of situation?
[25:02.82]We've located those soldiers you were looking for, but we're under orders not to engage until you guys reconnoiter.
[25:08.30]Understood.
[25:09.30]Step back down.
[25:13.95]What was the point of me going up here?
[25:16.81]Just to look at the roof?
[25:29.04]By the way, I have 47 bullets left.
[25:30.96]I have shot, like, 30.
[25:33.76]And there has not been a single enemy on the screen.
[25:36.27]So, I might need to restart the game.
[25:39.29]And just run through this.
[25:44.14]Hey, back already?
[25:45.54]See anything?
[25:46.00]You guys about done up there?
[25:48.18]Our day's just getting started.
[25:49.66]You boys run along.
[25:50.92]I'll be busy here for a while.
[25:53.22]Why?
[25:56.84]The guy's dead.
[25:57.48]Breathe!
[25:59.14]Come on, make the push!
[26:08.01]I've tried to forget.
[26:11.57]I've tried so hard to forget.
[26:24.40]These men are from fear.
[26:26.60]There are special attachments to our unit for the duration of this op.
[26:29.34]Minigun?
[26:30.00]They will be on point.
[26:31.56]Their mission is to assess the nature of the threat.
[26:34.26]Our job is to keep them alive.
[26:36.35]Do not engage the enemy.
[26:38.55]Remember that we are not dealing with ordinary bad guys.
[26:41.67]Team 1 will move in from the southwest.
[26:43.81]Team 2 will approach from the north.
[26:46.05]Once our recon is complete, we will rendezvous and wait for further orders.
[26:50.05]Um... Okay, let's saddle up.
[26:51.99]What if you're not on any- any team?
[26:56.80]Do I just stay in the helicopter?
[27:00.12]Oh, right.
[27:00.98]Yeah.
[27:02.26]James, right.
[27:04.44]You go ahead and open up your iPad and find us a good place to eat after.
[27:09.83]Really important job.
[27:12.21]Okay.
[27:14.61]I guess.
[27:20.61]Yes, sir.
[27:30.19]Open up Google Maps and just type in food.
[27:33.09]That is actually pretty good.
[27:36.83]Come on.
[27:37.29]Let's go.
[27:42.85]Okay.
[27:43.05]Stupid.
[27:57.69]Yeah, since we got Tweedledee and Tweedledum over here, I think I can do it.
[28:02.64]I'm going for it.
[28:04.16]Yes, sir!
[28:07.30]Come on, we ain't got all day.
[28:09.84]These two idiots.
[28:10.54]Alright, uh... I think it might be over in here.
[28:26.38]What is this?
[28:26.80]A price scanner?
[28:28.57]Reflex booster.
[28:30.57]Reflex is permanently boosted.
[28:37.09]Okay.
[28:41.08]Anything up here?
[28:41.64]No.
[28:54.56]Hey, I didn't- I didn't find the- I found a reflex booster though, dude Cool It's not over here!
[29:24.67]You know, it would be good if we all looked, instead of just telling me to do this.
[29:35.08]That doesn't work!
[29:38.02]Shooting the gate doesn't do anything!
[29:40.38]Wait, wait, wait.
[29:44.63]Why would everybody tell me to do that?
[29:47.81]Did I miss it over here?
[29:49.93]Maybe it's... yeah, I gotta keep going, I think.
[29:51.73]There we go, okay.
[30:10.13]Can I use this?
[30:11.20]Does it explode?
[30:13.00]Yup.
[30:15.56]They just hear that.
[30:17.56]Downstairs over there they hear a fucking explosion.
[30:23.33]Dude, you just have to press a button.
[30:25.75]What are you doing up there?
[30:30.19]Okay.
[30:30.93]Hey, I found the button!
[30:35.42]It's up here!
[30:49.30]It's gonna be like a... Yep.
[30:50.72]Coming!
[30:51.18]Wait, I'll... They're all... They're skeletons.
[31:18.98]If you look at her, you die.
[31:19.98]You turn and... That's like super Medusa.
[31:30.64]Medusa just turns you to stone.
[31:32.53]This peels all your skin and muscles off.
[31:35.33]And melts you.
[31:36.11]That's...
[31:38.04]Kind of fucked up.
[31:39.60]Alright.
[32:11.83]That's an interesting... How do they... Okay.
[32:18.46]Ah, it's...
[32:39.72]Probably just a guy pressing a button.
[32:41.02]Don't have to worry about it.
[32:44.07]I know what that's like.
[32:47.67]The kill command activated.
[33:06.55]Is there any stuff in this game?
[33:09.87]I like this game already because it's not stuff to pick up.
[33:13.31]I have problems with games when you have stuff to pick up.
[33:26.14]What?
[33:34.02]Who the fuck are these people?
[33:36.42]Uh oh.
[33:38.62]I thought- wait, we're not- Oh, these are bad, okay.
[33:49.34]What the fuck happened over there?
[33:51.84]Wait, what?
[33:54.08]What happened?
[33:58.63]Hold on, did I lose- did I lose the game?
[34:01.47]Alright, we-
[34:09.31]Okay, for a second I thought I was rendezvousing.
[34:13.21]And I stood there exploding.
[34:14.79]There was an explosion that way.
[34:16.33]Alright, I get it.
[34:18.07]Let's go.
[34:19.51]I just started shooting.
[34:46.36]Alright.
[34:47.08]Good.
[34:48.80]Ammo.
[34:57.97]Please listen closely, as our menu options have changed.
[35:02.39]It's been like that for fucking seven years!
[35:05.19]I think people know by now.
[35:17.59]Nothing else in here?
[35:18.19]Okay.
[35:22.02]Alright, he's dead.
[35:34.78]I should be peeking.
[35:37.13]Way more often than I do.
[35:38.25]Alright, wait.
[35:38.65]Hold on.
[35:39.81]Anybody up there?
[35:42.45]Health kits?
[35:43.39]Health bleach?
[35:43.87]I don't know.
[35:48.70]I'm gonna go up.
[36:01.47]It seriously is fucking Home Alone.
[36:09.43]What's in here?
[36:10.74]Ooh, med kit.
[36:13.02]To use Med Kit T to restore some of your health, you can carry up to 10.
[36:17.16]Okay, well that's good to know.
[36:18.16]Good thing I got a Med Kit.
[36:20.06]I want to upgrade the flashlight.
[36:23.89]I ain't going that way yet.
[36:24.59]There's another place to go down here.
[36:26.45]Is it fall damage?
[36:27.89]Nope.
[36:28.63]Best game ever.
[36:29.27]Okay.
[36:40.71]Okay.
[36:43.33]Nothing out here.
[36:46.58]Can I not break through this?
[36:51.68]I can't just turn sideways and slide through there?
[36:59.37]Oh well.
[37:02.75]I guess not.
[37:07.65]I'm too fat apparently, yeah.
[37:09.79]That's all good.
[37:12.92]Alright, I got everything I needed.
[37:13.82]Uh, let's keep going.
[37:17.38]T is health kit, right?
[37:18.18]Uh, I didn't really mean to do that, but it's okay.
[37:36.48]No, don't!
[37:37.08]Oh, wait, no, I want to go that way.
[37:38.14]Okay.
[37:38.64]That's how you get it.
[37:40.92]Why am I sliding on this?
[37:45.15]Oh, that's how you get out.
[37:46.58]Very cool.
[37:47.02]Let's go.
[37:50.62]Checkpoint.
[37:53.26]That's not it.
[37:55.10]Mouse 3 is... Mouse 3 is different.
[37:56.98]Because I changed it.
[38:38.00]I can't laugh that hard.
[38:44.93]Oh shit, he was smart.
[38:58.12]What happened to that guy?
[38:59.74]Why was there an explosion?
[39:00.80]Alright.
[39:01.76]I'm good.
[39:06.17]What?
[39:12.65]The gun play is actually pretty fun.
[39:14.67]Alright, I got a pistol.
[39:17.20]That's a double pistol.
[39:21.60]What do I got for health?
[39:22.12]95? 95?
[39:29.99]Any, uh, potions?
[39:39.01]It's fun.
[39:41.25]That's fun to shoot.
[39:41.97]Right in the head.
[39:58.38]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[39:59.12]I need armor.
[40:05.43]I gotta take flashlight off of V, by the way.
[40:08.25]It's getting in the way.
[40:09.59]I'm hitting C accidentally, because I don't know where C, V, and X are on the keyboard.
[40:14.46]And I'll laugh it up, it's fine.
[40:26.39]I don't see anybody.
[40:35.56]No, don't break it.
[40:47.79]Hello?
[40:49.97]We alright?
[40:51.07]We good?
[40:59.48]Okay.
[40:59.94]Pacific Rim.
[41:19.61]He's just like tricked.
[41:21.51]Check it out.
[41:22.05]Go see what happened.
[41:25.71]What a...
[41:38.37]Alright, we're good.
[41:43.14]Do you get a shotgun in this game?
[41:44.22]Because, damn, that would be fun.
[41:50.52]Yep.
[41:51.08]Oh, good, good, good, good.
[41:56.82]Fizzy Cola.
[41:58.46]Dice.
[42:01.20]Dicked.
[42:02.66]Squish.
[42:02.80]Squish.
[42:09.57]I feel like that's what you guys write in donation messages.
[42:15.70]What?
[42:20.12]Oh fuck, that's a grenade!
[42:22.16]How long did you hold that for?
[42:28.08]The timing on that was incredible.
[42:31.76]What is mouse for?
[42:32.56]I have to heal.
[43:05.85]They have these insane grenades.
[43:15.09]I have them too, but they blow up really fast.
[43:20.16]They are cooking these things for a full seven or eight seconds.
[43:24.66]Use the slow-mo.
[43:27.86]Oh, the camera's in a bad spot.
[43:30.10]Hold on.
[43:30.60]On the next save point, I'll move it.
[43:37.61]The game hasn't... The game hasn't taught me to use the slo-mo yet, though.
[43:42.90]Ooh, what's that?
[43:55.46]So, I need to be true to the video game.
[44:01.05]I don't want to break that, though.
[44:03.49]Oh, fuck.
[44:20.05]That's like super slow-mo videos.
[44:22.89]That guy's head rocked in a circle like five.
[44:26.33]That's how you know I hit him really hard.
[44:27.85]That's like when you punch somebody in the face like slow motion.
[44:31.39]It's like... And his face like turns to fucking yellow and you can see their eyes and skull pulsate and rock back and forth.
[44:47.79]That's so bad.
[44:49.78]Okay.
[44:50.82]That's a good strategy, though.
[44:51.96]A slow-mo punch in face.
[44:55.04]Anybody else in here?
[45:02.82]Oh, shit.
[45:04.77]Pick up.
[45:07.11]What is that?
[45:08.39]It's an assault rifle?
[45:11.25]And another pistol.
[45:13.31]How loud is this?
[45:15.81]Actually, pretty quiet.
[45:16.77]It's like underwater.
[45:17.83]Cool.
[45:18.25]Alright.
[45:20.93]I'm not gonna use it yet.
[45:21.61]I'm gonna stick with the default.
[45:26.36]Is this a new pistol?
[45:27.42]Or is this a... Yeah, it's just two of these.
[45:31.84]Tri-wheeled.
[45:38.24]Hold the other one in your mouth.
[45:39.46]Just like with your teeth.
[45:48.25]Why would they hit you with, like, feet?
[45:52.05]Hop on one foot and, like... That would be so funny.
[45:55.17]Why hasn't a video game done that, like, laugh out loud kind of humor?
[45:59.01]You got three pistols?
[45:59.91]Oh, here comes, like, a foot on camera up there.
[46:02.43]What a fucking hilarious moment that would be for all these streamers and YouTubers.
[46:08.60]If you can see... Oh!
[46:09.56]If you can see... What did it say?
[46:10.32]If you can see the blinking, it means what?
[46:12.28]That it can be activated?
[46:18.77]Okay.
[46:19.03]Loud noises.
[46:19.57]Anything else?
[46:20.24]What if he's like blocking something?
[46:42.81]No.
[46:43.39]You know, there could be something under there.
[46:44.79]Like, it could be any situation where, oh, there's a grenade under there.
[46:47.77]Because you did that.
[46:50.07]Alright.
[46:56.72]Let's go.
[46:57.06]I can't do this.
[46:57.58]It's a puzzle.
[46:59.26]I don't... I didn't think this was a puzzle game.
[47:01.06]I don't want to do it anymore.
[47:02.08]I think I'm done.
[47:02.50]I'm done.
[47:16.16]What?
[47:19.54]That's so much better than me at projectiles.
[47:30.41]Oh, fuck.
[47:53.21]Okay, don't fuck it up again.
[47:55.05]God dammit, this is far.
[47:58.57]Okay, fuck.
[48:00.41]Medkit.
[48:03.59]I didn't- they all just kinda spawned and came at me!
[48:09.63]Are you?
[48:21.30]Why is this on pulse fire now?
[48:26.04]There were not this many before.
[48:27.42]Did it add enemies?
[48:28.16]Alright, let's go.
[48:38.69]What the fuck?
[48:41.23]Okay.
[48:45.69]Is there a s- Oh, there is a save.
[48:47.47]Okay.
[48:48.25]I didn't know.
[48:55.74]Is there- was it F5?
[48:57.92]Quick saving.
[48:58.46]Alright.
[48:59.32]Well, now I know.
[49:02.66]Whoa!
[49:34.82]See ya.
[49:36.22]Alright, where are those grenades?
[49:43.72]Quick save.
[49:46.48]There's grenades in here.
[49:47.26]I know there is.
[49:47.70]Okay, got that.
[49:53.96]Where are the grenades?
[50:02.51]Come on.
[50:02.89]That can go off?
[50:03.49]There's nothing behind there or anything?
[50:10.44]Really?
[50:10.78]Okay, fine.
[50:11.26]Whatever.
[50:11.50]Alright, got that.
[50:14.56]There's no grenades.
[50:15.32]There they are.
[50:22.73]That's kinda cool.
[50:23.37]I'm gonna do that to somebody in slo-mo.
[50:25.29]Book save.
[50:29.59]Here we are, I made it.
[50:34.99]Wait.
[50:36.77]Wait, it's got armor too.
[50:38.95]A drop armor.
[50:40.21]That's pretty sick.
[50:41.45]Alright.
[50:42.69]Alright, here we go.
[50:54.33]That guy, that guy like threw it like this.
[50:58.17]Why did he go like this?
[51:00.07]Usually you throw, you go, alright man, let's like throw it.
[51:03.89]No, he went like this.
[51:06.27]Here we go.
[51:08.32]Like he's on a windmill.
[51:12.20]He threw it right into the ground.
[51:13.34]He reversed softball pitch that.
[51:24.84]Alright, good.
[51:26.28]Back upstairs.
[51:26.74]Here we go.
[51:35.05]So he baseball pitched it.
[51:36.21]No, no, no.
[51:36.69]You don't pitch like that in baseball.
[51:39.23]Nobody goes spin, spin up here and lets go up here.
[51:44.44]Nobody does that.
[51:47.30]You do that under and you let go for softball.
[51:51.12]You don't do that in baseball.
[51:54.56]I know this.
[52:00.25]I can't climb through that.
[52:01.07]Alright, let's jump kick.
[52:04.92]Wait.
[52:24.56]I think I got him.
[52:26.16]I think I did it.
[52:31.81]Did he say, oh, slow-mo?
[52:35.91]He didn't say that, right?
[52:37.43]Am I just injecting that in?
[52:38.61]Ah, why did my motherboard come out of the fucking monitor?
[52:46.30]What?
[52:46.74]Oh.

[55:57.74]Ah, bullet in the head.
[55:59.22]What the fuck was that?

[57:09.23]And a telephone that's not off the hook.
[57:11.83]Wait.
[57:12.49]Okay.
[57:22.33]And they're still doing the scary little girl thing.
[57:24.97]They just turned it into a doll.
[57:27.29]It's evolved.
[57:40.05]Your heightened reflexes will give you an edge against enemies.
[57:41.85]Press slow-mo to enter slow-motion.
[57:43.79]See, I told you.
[57:44.32]They didn't even give me a tutorial for it yet, and you guys are trying to get me to do it.
[57:47.62]I didn't know what happens.
[58:12.44]Oh, the recoil.
[58:15.23]Alright, let's end this guy with a kick.
[58:47.50]Where's this guy?
[58:47.90]Did he die?
[58:50.44]No, there's somebody still over here.
[58:55.08]No, he's dead.
[58:59.15]Good.
[59:03.17]Checkpoint saved.
[59:04.97]Let's keep going.
[59:08.99]Do a sidekick?
[59:19.83]Ooh, what's that?
[59:21.61]Same thing I had?
[59:22.25]Yeah.
[59:23.33]Crouch and melee.
[59:27.47]A slide kick.
[59:28.45]Do I have to be running for a certain amount of time?
[59:39.74]Alright, free slow-mo.
[59:46.92]I could use it.
[59:56.49]I'm a fucking idiot.
[59:58.05]I just had to do it.
[59:59.19]It's like my attention problems.
[60:03.98]I thought I was far enough away.
[60:04.90]Let's keep going.
[60:09.78]Alright, hold on.
[60:23.89]Um...
[60:26.60]Doesn't look like you have anything.
[60:33.96]No, dude, turn your own stream off.
[60:35.53]What are you, fucking an amateur?
[60:48.49]They don't have any stuff?
[60:51.25]No.
[60:52.69]This looks safe.
[60:55.36]I would highly doubt that.
[60:56.74]But, you know, it's all good.
[61:01.74]So, slide kick, huh?
[61:02.92]Do I have to hold crouch?
[61:09.66]How do you do a slide?
[61:10.50]Double tap?
[61:16.37]I've got to be sprinting first.
[61:17.61]Am I not sprinting already?
[61:36.95]Oh, I probably should run.
[61:38.41]I thought it was a cutscene.
[61:41.05]I thought it was... Okay, I thought it was a... I thought it was like a thing that we were watching.
[61:46.63]It was playing music.
[61:47.75]It was like... I thought it was one of these kind of scenarios.
[61:56.46]There is nothing here.
[62:06.57]Just get to the turnaround, and... Didn't do it first try, that means we don't do it at all.
[62:22.62]Alright.
[62:24.38]Part two.
[62:26.12]Quick save often.
[62:28.12]You're supposed to die there.
[62:30.35]So then the game can tell you, hey, I mean, just want to let you know, you probably should save all the time.
[62:35.99]See, I wouldn't have done that unless you guys told me to, so you know what I'm saying?
[62:41.33]Okay, here we go.
[62:51.19]Did I make it?
[62:52.31]Why am I going up?
[62:56.43]I was trying to go through the door, but I got... I jumped out.
[63:01.91]Okay.
[63:07.44]Cool.
[63:13.86]He's alive.
[63:14.54]Should I call in a medivac?
[63:16.68]He doesn't appear to be injured, although I don't know how he survived.
[63:20.56]Interval three, escalation.
[63:21.44]Worry about that later.
[63:22.80]I'm reading Fettel's transmitter near that position.
[63:25.12]We've got to take that fucker out, fast.
[63:27.70]Jen, keep looking for Jankowski.
[63:29.50]I'm still reading his life signs.
[63:31.30]You can't send him in alone.
[63:32.50]That's crazy.
[63:34.46]He can take care of himself.
[63:35.80]Now move.
[63:36.89]When we're just... I was just in there doing... I could go back in.
[63:40.03]Alright, I'm going back in.
[63:42.87]Can we trade?
[63:46.49]You're standing out here.
[63:47.87]You're not in any immediate danger.
[63:51.02]You're sending me in to go kill this guy.
[63:52.48]I want the better gun.
[63:54.30]You don't have... Give me a helmet, too.
[63:59.54]It's the same gun?
[64:00.24]No, it's not.
[64:01.98]His is bigger.
[64:03.95]Let's compare guns.
[64:04.87]Well, whatever.
[64:05.33]I want your ammo.
[64:06.03]Just take your clip out.
[64:09.52]Wait, where does it want me to go?
[64:10.78]What was that?
[64:18.82]Uh-oh.
[64:28.51]Okay.
[64:29.39]Dead guy.
[64:33.01]Okay, no, this is our choice.
[64:35.05]Not our choice, this is our chance.
[64:37.25]Bad guys.
[64:37.75]Ooh, what's this?
[64:38.28]Fuck.
[65:00.70]That's such a... I want that so bad.
[65:14.30]Bad guys.
[65:17.86]I see three tubes.
[65:19.02]That's an explosion.
[65:19.90]Wouldn't happen, right?
[65:20.68]Or are they punching bags?
[65:27.85]Okay, don't fuck around there.
[65:36.63]One shot, come on.
[65:40.04]Why am I getting flashbacks of a different game?
[65:43.36]What game did this happen in?
[65:48.86]This happened in a game.
[65:52.74]Right?
[65:54.37]I'm not insane, am I?
[65:55.91]I remember being, like, on that exact bridge.
[65:57.77]Alright, listen to the message.
[66:12.77]Did I just turn the alarm on?
[66:14.95]No, alright.
[66:16.63]This changes this to go this way.
[66:18.19]Wait, what about down here?
[66:24.49]Any guns or weapons or hidden secrets or something?
[66:28.59]Probably not, but I'm just going to do it.
[66:35.75]Doesn't look like it.
[66:40.93]Nope.
[66:42.40]Worth a shot.
[66:44.62]Why not just build two bridges?
[66:46.04]Yeah.
[66:48.56]It seems very, very stupid.
[66:52.72]Why do you need an entire electronic mechanism to spin this around when you could just have it cross?
[66:58.13]In the middle.
[66:59.55]Slide kick.
[67:02.67]How do you... Alright, let me get the slide kick down.
[67:07.09]Let's walk.
[67:07.71]I am running.
[67:15.08]I missed an upgrade.
[67:15.86]What?
[67:17.47]Back to the boxes.
[67:19.21]Check the controls.
[67:22.29]Alright, so controls.
[67:25.05]Configure controls.
[67:27.58]Toggle walk.
[67:29.44]Movement.
[67:31.92]Step right, turn left, side walk, jump, crouch.
[67:35.26]Toggle walk.
[67:41.06]uh interaction flashlight slow-mo aim reload throw grenade look down center view inventory uh fear one doesn't have a sprint yeah so how do you do the slide kick alright back so we sit back to the boxes because I missed something did I it's forward crouch melee holy
[68:07.52]Oh, nice.
[68:09.96]Reflex is permanently boosted.
[68:12.38]So you gotta go like that.
[68:14.79]Okay.
[68:18.03]Can you do it in the air?
[68:20.37]Sort of.
[68:20.63]Ow!
[68:28.65]That's a broken ankle.
[68:30.89]Alright, so I moved the thing, right?
[68:33.01]We're gonna go this way.
[68:38.24]Save it.
[68:38.96]Alright.
[68:39.48]Turn the flashlight off.
[68:40.27]We don't need it right now.
[68:40.93]Okay.
[68:47.15]Down.
[68:47.67]Into the sewer.
[68:52.40]I don't think fall damage exists.
[68:55.14]It does not.
[68:55.86]That's been confirmed.
[68:56.68]You can jump anywhere you want.
[68:58.94]Literally anywhere.
[69:13.32]Oh god.
[69:14.18]Okay.
[69:14.84]Narrow tunnels.
[69:15.98]Great.
[69:16.24]I don't have any grenades.
[69:25.99]Otherwise I just would have thrown one down this hole.
[69:47.23]Fresh blood on the ceiling.
[69:48.27]Ooh.
[69:49.55]Health booster.
[69:51.69]What?
[69:52.95]What?
[69:53.31]What?
[69:53.53]Why am I heart beating?
[69:54.45]110.
[70:01.38]Nice.
[70:01.76]Alright.
[70:02.20]Um.
[70:03.08]Caution.
[70:03.48]I thought that was a person.
[70:17.96]Can I go in this building?
[70:26.67]No admittance.
[70:27.37]Oh, well.
[70:29.53]Peek.
[70:30.05]Alright, there's health over there.
[70:33.39]There's a guy right there.
[70:48.96]Okay, here he comes.
[70:49.50]Okay.
[70:50.95]Slide.
[70:52.45]Ready?
[70:56.37]Here he comes.
[71:06.20]Did you hear that?
[71:07.16]What happened out here?
[71:08.40]Oh, Frank was practicing backflips again.
[71:10.46]This time, he ain't gonna be practicing anymore.
[71:18.56]exploded because you did try to do a backflip and you grazed your head on the ground.
[71:25.49]Holy shit.
[71:38.14]Holy shit.
[71:40.06]I wonder what that looks like.
[71:42.95]You know, we always get to see from the perspective of the person playing the game what slow motion looks like, but we never get to see what it looks like on the other side.
[71:51.89]I want to see what that looks like on the other side.
[71:53.67]Are you just really fast?
[72:08.60]You're just super fast.
[72:10.48]Okay.
[72:11.70]Ooh.
[72:12.60]Grenade.
[72:13.62]What's that?
[72:14.42]Nothing?
[72:15.44]That's not what that sounds like.
[72:16.53]Okay.
[72:20.63]Let's keep going.
[72:21.67]What about the lockers?
[72:26.31]Nope.
[72:29.23]When am I gonna move my camera?
[72:32.41]That's... I know.
[72:33.23]Alright.
[72:33.53]I'll do it right now.
[72:35.67]Where should I put it?
[72:38.92]Is there a good place for this to go?
[72:41.60]Top right?
[72:51.50]That's okay.
[72:52.00]Alright, that's better.
[72:56.70]I'm not going to put it in the center of the screen.
[73:00.24]There you go, now you can see.
[73:02.43]There.
[73:07.03]Put it right in the middle.
[73:08.01]I'm not gonna put it right in the middle.
[73:10.71]No.
[73:10.91]You know how many times I've done that?
[73:15.67]Doing that?
[73:16.79]Put webcam in middle, make it three times bigger?
[73:19.20]Alright, let's slide another person.
[73:31.77]Why would you know I was coming?
[73:35.03]I'm gonna slide tackle the first person that comes down the hall.
[73:36.73]One.
[73:37.81]Two.
[73:38.69]Here it comes.
[73:41.49]One.
[73:42.39]Two.
[73:43.25]Three.
[73:45.62]Shit!
[73:55.80]Squad, check in.
[74:08.20]Who's left?
[74:08.62]Ooh, new gun?
[74:13.17]Slide tackle this guy.
[74:16.71]Where is he?
[74:17.63]Isn't he right here?
[74:18.06]Oh, no, they're dead, okay.
[74:25.94]But is this a new gun?
[74:38.29]Stuff.
[74:40.11]Is it stuff?
[74:41.99]Why is there a ladder here?
[74:49.52]Oh, alright.
[74:50.78]This is just the way to go.
[74:51.60]Oh, come on.
[74:56.06]Really?
[74:57.86]Free stuff?
[74:58.60]Secret stuff?
[74:59.84]No, I didn't get... No, there's nothing there.
[75:05.37]Go get it.
[75:05.77]There's nothing there.
[75:33.44]I'm just- am I trying to make as much noise as possible?
[75:45.30]How many?
[75:46.56]One.
[75:47.04]Two.
[75:56.30]Wait, why am I going so slow?
[76:10.65]Oh!
[76:11.37]Got him!
[76:15.61]No, I'm trying to... That hurts more than a bullet.
[76:36.47]Turn the light off.
[76:36.91]I don't have any more grenades left.
[76:41.53]Bad.
[76:42.03]Should I switch to the other gun?
[76:47.05]No.
[76:47.25]What's the point of switching to another gun when you have the good one?
[76:57.19]Slow down.
[77:00.23]Is there anybody to jump kick?
[77:01.33]I want to jump kick somebody through a window.
[77:04.99]Is that possible?
[77:11.36]Nothing in any of this shit?
[77:12.48]Come on, really?
[77:13.14]Am I blind?
[77:18.67]No.
[77:24.95]One of these times, one of these days, someone's going to just be standing around the corner.
[77:28.92]And it's going to be awesome.
[77:31.62]Well, here comes a boss fight or something.
[77:34.94]Why would this all be here?
[77:39.94]Are there bosses in this game?
[77:49.84]Yeah, this is a boss.
[77:50.54]Look at this boss room.
[77:57.39]What?
[77:57.79]Oh, shit.
[77:58.59]I froze up there.
[78:09.11]Holy shit, he got in.
[78:18.69]I can't see!
[78:19.75]Okay, that's not a person.
[78:41.69]There's one more.
[78:42.27]Where is he?
[78:43.77]Is he dead?
[78:44.29]Oh, he's dead.
[78:45.61]Okay.
[78:58.67]Healing, good.
[79:00.13]Anything else?
[79:00.61]Grenades.
[79:01.29]Coffee machine.
[79:08.79]Come on, I did it.
[79:09.63]I did it.
[79:10.59]I did the thing.
[79:13.40]Guaranteed fucking comedy points.
[79:15.10]I did it.
[79:15.52]Alright, I'm gonna go up and run.
[79:30.70]Got it.
[79:30.96]Okay.
[79:31.46]Keep going.
[79:31.98]Save it.
[79:33.64]I love quicksave.
[79:35.96]Seriously.
[79:37.54]It's so useful in every video game.
[79:43.53]Well, that's convenient.
[79:45.21]I wonder what I'm supposed to do with these.
[79:46.39]Can I pick them up?
[79:52.71]I can't.
[79:53.09]But wait a minute.
[79:53.79]We got assault rifle.
[79:56.30]More of this.
[79:58.27]First aid.
[79:59.49]Seven health packs.
[80:02.99]Should I restart?
[80:05.07]How much health do I have?
[80:05.75]No, I'm good.
[80:06.43]I didn't mean to do that.
[80:08.73]It's fine.
[80:13.60]Alright, I'm ready.
[80:17.96]Certain laptops contain useful information.
[80:19.56]Activate the laptop to retrieve data stored on it.
[80:21.64]The data is uploading now.
[80:29.15]Why are there green tanks on the ground?
[80:31.31]If someone's not gonna, like, scream and sprint down this hall.
[80:34.75]Okay.
[80:34.97]Good to know.
[80:59.39]Why are there green tanks?
[81:03.77]On the wall.
[81:12.35]Not on the wall.
[81:12.89]You know what I mean.
[81:14.05]And there's this shit.
[81:14.93]Okay.
[81:16.21]Look at all this prep.
[81:27.22]80 armor.
[81:30.35]What was that?
[81:31.57]Save it.
[81:42.18]This is the door.
[81:42.88]Can I move this out of the way to make a shortcut?
[81:46.46]No.
[81:48.84]Alright, here we go.
[81:51.94]Whatever it is, it is.
[81:56.71]Turn up the difficulty?
[81:59.43]No.
[82:01.89]No.
[82:02.90]Absolute zero, no.
[82:03.72]I have to like- we'll see after like another four hours.
[82:13.08]I can't- I can't even turn the di- lookit, where can I do that?
[82:16.65]Game.
[82:16.97]Yeah, I know, it- hud- difficult- hud- okay, I'll put the difficulty for the hud up at harder.
[82:38.60]Where's the grenade?
[82:40.06]Nice!
[82:40.50]What should I do?
[83:12.36]No, this is like playing The Division now.
[83:14.68]Everybody has like 5,000 HP.
[83:15.66]Is that guy gonna throw a grenade in here?
[83:30.29]Okay.
[83:43.89]No, don't... You're gonna get a shotgun?
[83:48.51]Too bad.
[83:48.87]Where's all their ammo?
[83:50.77]I think I have full ammo in this gun.
[83:52.03]Let's use it for a little while.
[83:54.13]This thing's pretty sick, so... Okay, save it.
[84:04.94]I can't... What the fuck was that?
[84:06.70]Now get me in here.
[84:15.05]Grenade?
[84:15.53]Nope.
[84:16.19]Just a can of soda.
[84:18.67]They so badly want me to be ready.
[84:20.91]I have eight health packs.
[84:22.83]Is that what it is?
[84:24.09]Is that why the difficulty had to be increased?
[84:25.99]Because I have eight health packs, and I'm only supposed to have two or something?
[84:30.27]And, oh, yeah, you're so lucky.
[84:31.83]You can heal whenever you want, right?
[84:33.41]That's what it is.
[84:34.37]Yeah, I knew it.
[84:35.49]I knew it.
[84:35.85]I'm playing the game very, very, very well.
[84:38.02]And all of a sudden, it's like, you're playing too well.
[84:40.04]You have too many health packs.
[84:41.00]Turn it up.
[84:51.21]How do I turn damage numbers on?
[84:52.49]Because I might as well use that too.
[85:10.02]Alligator or something.
[85:11.28]Let's give something in the water.
[85:17.94]In my opinion...
[85:20.20]This is just me.
[85:21.74]But in my opinion, if there's, like, somebody waiting for you or stalking you here, there's, like, the enemies, this is what I would do in this scenario, for real.
[85:29.23]Instead of, where the fuck are they?
[85:30.67]Can they see me?
[85:31.25]I would just start fucking screaming and firing!
[85:35.12]And then they'd be like, what the fuck?
[85:36.60]Wait, is he in here?
[85:40.04]See?
[85:40.40]It worked.
[85:44.06]See, that fucked him up, because they thought, they were willing to go in the water, and they were like, let me sneak around, let me see, be careful.
[85:51.04]No.
[85:52.20]That ain't me.
[86:05.21]Hey, when he gets to 10 health packs, we should put it on extreme difficulty.
[86:10.51]That is never going to happen.
[86:12.09]If you want to see a blind playthrough of extreme difficulty, you are watching the wrong video game livestream.
[86:38.34]Alright, we're in.
[86:53.33]Cool.
[86:58.71]Did I die?
[87:00.75]No.
[87:00.95]I thought there was... Okay, good.
[87:02.07]It's just blood.
[87:07.17]Hey!
[87:08.25]That was... Alright, that was kind of scary.
[87:09.79]It was.
[87:13.65]That was a little scary.
[87:14.73]Just a little.
[87:16.31]Wait, you think you're having a better journey than me?
[87:28.85]You think you're having a cool- Oh, I found some- Oh, yeah, well- Hey, I found, uh, I know- I found human remains, too, and, uh, a fucking monster in the water was trying to kill me.
[87:37.58]I killed it, though.
[87:38.54]I mean, but, like, tell me more about how awesome your trip is.
[87:42.06]Trying to fucking one-up me.
[87:50.34]Am I underwater?
[87:51.94]No.
[87:58.00]There it is.
[87:58.70]It's huge though.
[88:24.96]It's unexpected that I still survived.
[88:28.01]Hey, it's alright.
[88:29.41]I've got 11 health back.
[88:31.03]I can't even pick him up.
[88:32.33]I'm doing so well.
[88:39.77]Extreme, extreme.
[88:40.91]No, that's not... Okay, we're good.
[88:48.58]I have to... I need to lure somebody over here to do this to them.
[88:57.94]She's afraid of you.
[89:05.02]Oh, wait.
[89:06.25]This is like a new checkpoint.
[89:07.23]Hold on.
[89:07.61]What's over here?
[89:08.13]I've already been here?
[89:22.52]It's like that game.
[89:23.64]You know that game where you hit the ice down, the little squares, and the penguin falls through the middle?
[89:30.16]God, I've loved that game.
[89:35.70]Here we go.
[89:39.73]Where's the, where's it?
[89:40.73]Oh, right here.
[89:41.21]Did somebody just crash a car?
[89:51.47]I want to use this.
[89:52.45]Can I roll it?
[89:54.59]This doesn't hurt me, right?
[89:55.43]Okay, I think I can do this.
[89:57.09]Okay.
[90:03.91]Is it on the ground?
[90:06.49]No.
[90:06.63]I don't think I can do it.
[90:12.13]Unless I can hit it right here.
[90:14.27]Get it out of the- Okay, it's out of the plane.
[90:19.72]The fuck does that physics make any sense?
[90:21.30]I'm trying to roll this way.
[90:24.00]Oh my god.
[90:28.64]Keep going.
[90:29.05]Alright, if you hit it in the front, it rolls backwards.
[90:36.07]Fuck it.
[90:36.85]I don't even... Never mind.
[90:52.07]I did not expect them to be standing right here.
[91:02.32]They do this thing where it's almost like they're auto-targeted on you, and they're strafing around you, so their hand goes like, aiming in different directions behind them and to the right and left of them.
[91:39.25]Whatever He just kicked me in the face and killed me
[91:54.82]How far away am I?
[91:57.50]What the fuck?
[91:59.02]Why did I not save it?
[92:01.44]No, I did.
[92:02.00]I did.
[92:03.66]Okay, I'm... You know, I just need to make a macro in this game.
[92:11.09]Or just like a script that runs in the background that presses F5 every 10 minutes.
[92:19.29]That's not illegal.
[92:20.39]Hmm.
[92:27.36]Oh shit.
[92:30.28]We both did the same thing.
[92:31.80]Where is this person?
[92:32.70]Don't die again.
[92:35.06]I'm stuck in the... My DPI just... Why?
[92:41.78]What is happening?
[93:03.72]I'm using health potions.
[93:06.84]He's using his spin bot.
[93:15.50]Okay, there it is.
[93:16.99]HP.
[93:18.97]What's that?
[93:19.31]An arm?
[93:19.71]Okay.
[93:23.21]This is... No, this is not that far.
[93:35.84]Yep.
[93:43.16]I don't... Why do I not remember this?
[93:44.50]Anybody else not remember this?
[93:55.36]The game Icebreaker.
[93:56.26]Right in the middle.
[94:03.41]I don't remember this at all.
[94:08.41]Do I go a different way?
[94:09.68]I think I went a different way.
[94:10.58]I got one.
[94:39.92]Alright.
[94:41.36]Who's left?
[94:41.88]Anybody?
[94:52.84]Still live.
[94:54.55]Got him.
[94:58.73]Open the valve?
[95:06.45]Not yet.
[95:07.11]Alright.
[95:11.86]Lots of ammo over here, though.
[95:13.16]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[95:13.82]That's all.
[95:15.94]I have too much of this.
[95:17.34]It's alright.
[95:17.78]I like to use... This thing's better.
[95:19.20]Stronger.
[95:20.26]Faster.
[95:21.74]Less recoil.
[95:22.54]Alright, let's go.
[95:30.22]You're playing... I'm playing Daft Punk?
[95:32.20]What do you mean?
[95:32.66]Daft Punk?
[95:40.55]Oh, shit.
[95:44.81]Okay.
[95:48.24]Are we gonna... Get him!
[96:04.55]One grenade.
[96:18.92]Got it.
[96:21.84]Got it.
[96:22.44]That's like the... Got it.
[96:24.34]Got it.
[96:29.08]Reflex booster.
[96:29.80]Got it.
[96:31.98]Okay.
[96:43.17]I'm gonna go this way.
[96:45.97]Shoot the grenade in mid-air.
[96:47.83]Oh.
[96:48.76]Absolutely we're doing that next.
[96:51.78]Second I get an opportunity to, I'm doing that.
[96:53.86]I got one chance.
[96:54.64]What is this?
[97:02.47]A buoy?
[97:06.99]Looks like we're going down.
[97:07.75]Okay.
[97:16.84]did I just do I'm throwing my that's g throws your gun on the ground okay why would you ever do that f and g being that close to each other is going to be very very bad I don't think I want those two bound
[97:49.30]Throw all your guns on the ground.
[97:53.76]All melee, run.
[98:01.20]Oh, sour, please.
[98:17.52]Here we go.
[98:19.80]What does that do?
[98:20.98]Raises the water level.
[98:23.68]Or... I don't know.
[98:25.30]It does something to the water?
[98:26.94]What does it say?
[98:28.36]Caution.
[98:30.18]Operation by certified operators only.
[98:32.54]Okay.
[98:44.47]Ooh, it's full now.
[98:46.08]And I can go over that way.
[98:47.04]Alright.
[98:53.45]I don't trust this.
[98:54.07]What do you think?
[98:56.61]Grenade in there?
[98:57.15]Okay, that scared the shit out of me.
[99:17.33]Okay, I don't know.
[99:17.97]For some reason, I thought I had to use that.
[99:21.98]How is it already broken?
[99:23.10]Impossible.
[99:24.24]What?
[99:25.52]Oh, this is where I came from.
[99:26.76]Right.
[99:27.04]Thank God.
[99:28.10]You guys wonder why I'm doing that.
[99:30.68]Why does he keep breaking those?
[99:33.11]Well, because it's a breadcrumb trip.
[99:35.31]And I know where I've been.
[99:37.13]Okay.
[99:47.40]Oh baby!
[99:49.40]They're all alive Dead What?
[100:09.28]I thought he dropped the grenade on the ground.
[100:11.65]I was gonna say, dude, what the hell is the matter with you?
[100:18.83]Great commentary.
[100:22.33]Dude, what the hell is the matter with you?
[100:27.30]Paying attention and focusing on where I'm going.
[100:30.94]Words coming out of my mouth to fill dead air.
[100:35.04]Dude, what the... Okay.
[100:40.37]Is this... Now that's what I'm talking about.
[100:42.59]I'm never gonna have another gun ever.
[100:45.84]I love... I love a shotty, you know what I mean?
[100:48.62]Okay.
[101:02.61]Ooh.
[101:03.21]What are those, mines?
[101:03.93]There's something in there.
[101:08.07]That...
[101:10.92]There's nothing in there.
[101:11.56]Uh-oh, I don't, I can't.
[101:15.06]I mean, that was cool, but I... I'm trying to fight!
[101:42.60]I thought he was dead.
[101:50.40]Why have I been... Are you serious?
[101:56.61]It bounced off the ceiling.
[101:59.11]It bounced off the ceiling, but it's okay.
[102:01.01]I still got it.
[102:10.83]Garlic bacon burger?
[102:11.83]That sounds pretty... That's a lot of fun to do, but I need to stop doing that.
[102:21.68]Alright, that's pretty dang fun to do, but not gonna do that anymore.
[102:28.80]Here we go.
[102:29.33]Shotgun.
[102:29.91]Save the game.
[102:30.61]Here we go.
[102:31.09]I'm not messing around anymore.
[102:32.89]Watch this one.
[102:34.41]Just going for it.
[102:38.39]mine just pick it up let's get a couple of these proximity graze it when the enemies can close press five to switch approximately good before to switch back for okay I'll check it out
[103:17.03]I'm telling you, they're not throwing them right.
[103:21.75]What's that?
[103:22.49]Okay.
[103:28.28]Through the middle!
[103:29.54]Oh shit, it spins!
[103:31.00]No!
[103:35.04]I thought it was a gray, it wasn't a gray.
[103:38.02]Who?
[103:40.21]Who the fuck did you come from the ceiling?
[103:43.49]What?
[103:49.22]That guy fell from the ceiling.
[103:54.99]Why are you crawling over here?
[103:58.51]Oh, this game is fucking ridiculous.
[104:00.23]I love it.
[104:07.06]Okay.
[104:11.52]Oh, I hear Otto.
[104:18.72]No!
[104:19.30]Shit!
[104:19.64]The wrong button!
[104:23.94]Ah, let me explain, let me explain, let me explain.
[104:26.72]This is melee.
[104:29.48]This is grenade.
[104:30.94]I gotta stop putting these so close to each other.
[104:33.09]Grenade?
[104:45.75]Where is he?
[104:47.35]Up there.
[104:54.96]Come on, fall!
[104:55.86]Fall!
[104:56.78]That sucks!
[104:59.26]Oh well.
[105:07.36]Okay.
[105:09.25]Got some stuff.
[105:10.45]Uh, back to the shotgun.
[105:20.34]Move, move, move, move!
[105:21.46]Get up!
[105:21.66]What are you doing?
[105:22.58]What the fuck am I?
[105:24.90]What?
[105:25.50]I'm... Okay, that doesn't work.
[105:35.89]Um...
[105:48.14]I need explosions.
[105:49.38]Well, we really would be great if I had.
[105:53.72]You know, a couple of landmines would be fantastic right now, but I don't have them.
[105:59.25]I don't have any.
[106:10.99]Where is it?
[106:21.90]That didn't do anything!
[106:33.21]Why did he just turn off?
[106:35.64]OW!
[106:42.46]Why was that so loud?
[106:44.24]What is this thing?
[106:46.23]Oh shit, it's like a railgun.
[106:51.24]Alright, save it.
[106:54.53]Alright, hold on.
[106:56.01]I think I gotta go let Otto outside.
[106:59.63]Give me a second.
[107:00.20]I'll be right back.
[107:01.62]I gotta go see Otto.
[109:05.61]Okay, he is taken care of.
[109:09.67]And while there's a lot of people here, I do want to talk about this because I brought it up in the beginning of the stream.
[109:16.86]But there weren't a whole lot of people here at the very beginning.
[109:20.50]So this week, I'm on a couple of new medications for my stomach.
[109:26.72]And they're kind of like fucking me up a little.
[109:29.84]So what we're going to do is instead of streaming like six or seven hours a few times, we're going to do like four or five hours, like five times.
[109:40.45]You know what I mean?
[109:41.97]So there's going to be more streams, but less time on each stream.
[109:50.84]So, just want to make sure people are aware of that.
[109:52.94]Because there is a very specific reason why.
[109:56.18]I will not go into the details, but... More streams, less time.
[110:00.92]Instead of the typical what you're used to is like six to eight hours.
[110:03.56]Like six, seven... I'm getting a little nervous about that comment.
[110:12.40]Let's go.
[110:14.70]Oh, there I am.
[110:19.21]So that was big guy.
[110:25.41]Wait, what am I doing?
[110:26.05]I need two headphones.
[110:27.57]It's so much better to play games with headphones in.
[110:31.09]I've been missing a lot for the last, like, two straight decades.
[110:33.60]Damn.
[110:33.84]Okay, do I... I want to keep this gun for now.
[110:40.42]Get the shotgun?
[110:41.06]I want to try this weird laser pointer.
[110:44.62]Yes!
[110:45.50]Yes!
[110:45.84]I'm so happy it did that.
[110:47.04]Okay.
[111:04.22]What?
[111:06.90]They're pulling out.
[111:09.09]Are they afraid of me?
[111:13.11]Do I have them in a full retreat?
[111:16.77]What did I just do?
[111:17.89]I didn't pick up anything.
[111:19.97]It just took a health potion.
[111:20.82]I didn't press anything.
[111:26.08]What?
[111:26.20]I did not press the button to do that.
[111:30.46]Ooh, found the secret.
[111:33.53]Permanent health boost.
[111:35.65]I'll take it.
[111:36.11]115, nice.
[111:37.71]I love upgrades.
[111:42.94]How much almond milk do I have?
[111:44.26]In my fridge right now, zero, because it's gone.
[111:46.02]Alright, let's go back.
[111:57.12]I want to see how this gun works.
[111:58.26]Is it a one-hit kill?
[112:09.26]Is that guy streaming?
[112:19.92]Where's he aiming?
[112:23.86]I want to see how he's aiming this gun.
[112:25.20]It's important to me.
[112:28.26]Never mind.
[112:28.76]Whoa!
[112:40.80]This thing is insane.
[112:41.94]Okay.
[112:43.40]That's crazy.
[112:46.34]It's a... Wow.
[112:47.96]I like this thing.
[112:50.01]Is that gas?
[112:51.67]Yep.
[112:52.39]No, it's not.
[112:52.83]What's going on?
[112:55.89]Is this room filled with gas?
[113:07.46]I have no idea.
[113:08.16]Wait.
[113:10.79]Oh, you can get that open, please.
[113:13.91]Well, I don't know.
[113:15.55]Oh, shit!
[113:16.27]What is going on here?
[113:20.27]Cool, dude.
[113:21.15]How do I get back?
[113:25.85]Oh.
[113:34.44]Turn the gas off.
[113:36.34]Yep.
[113:39.09]Or, uh, rise the water.
[113:41.91]That works too.
[113:43.88]I got a checkpoint here.
[113:47.44]Hammer?
[113:53.72]Check the room first.
[113:55.62]Because I can now go in here.
[114:01.03]I thought that was a person crouched.
[114:03.45]Ooh, alright.
[114:04.11]Shotgun, but how loud is it going to be?
[114:06.75]Be careful.
[114:11.15]No, I want this thing.
[114:12.83]This thing is awesome.
[114:13.85]One headshot and they're just stuck to a wall.
[114:15.57]It's beautiful.
[114:16.39]I love it.
[114:17.67]Swap the way... Huh?
[114:21.22]Oh.
[114:21.96]You can just take any three weapons you want.
[114:25.22]That is very interesting.
[114:27.48]I'm glad you told me.
[114:29.38]Interesting stuff.
[114:30.18]Okay.
[114:32.56]I thought that one was light weapons, two was medium, and three was heavy or something.
[114:37.51]I don't know.
[114:39.11]How am I supposed to know?
[114:44.40]Save it.
[114:44.88]Right here.
[114:53.56]What is that?
[114:54.12]I hear something.
[114:55.00]Turn the flashlight off.
[114:59.81]This is a place to hide.
[115:00.57]I'm gonna have to hide back here.
[115:01.75]I know it.
[115:08.19]Where is Alma?
[115:09.49]I don't know what you're talking about!
[115:11.82]Some secrets get buried deeper than others.
[115:15.32]But I know where to dig.
[115:16.99]No, wait!
[115:17.79]You've got the wrong guy!
[115:18.97]Hush now, Mr. Moody.
[115:22.13]The time for talk is done.
[115:25.59]Please!
[115:26.19]No!
[115:32.88]Alright.
[115:33.30]That's the guy we gotta get rid of.
[115:35.64]He's a real bad guy.
[115:41.40]But wait a minute, didn't, wasn't there someone else?
[115:43.88]No, there wasn't, okay.
[115:54.80]Hey, hey, a crawling horror movie trailer girl.
[116:00.97]Of course.
[116:02.81]How could I have ever thought it was gonna be something else?
[116:04.39]Then on all fours, here I'm running at the camera.
[116:08.65]And then I just have to get su- I have to land on my stomach and get sucked backwards!
[116:13.41]And then smash into a mirror!
[116:32.58]Sup?
[116:33.14]Okay.
[116:35.87]Mission three is pretty much done.
[116:38.64]No, it's not.
[116:50.70]Just make it down.
[116:52.95]Make it down, make it down.
[117:07.96]They all deserve to die.
[117:09.90]I wouldn't even be scared.
[117:13.06]I just didn't expect you to be there.
[117:15.46]No one can look cool when someone startles them.
[117:18.94]Guys, when Dwayne the Rock Johnson is standing there and he's, like, flexing in a mirror, just, like, looking huge and fucking awesome, and somebody comes up behind him and, like, grabs him, he's gonna go, Ugh!
[117:33.87]You can't, nobody looks cool that way.
[117:42.30]A devastating explosion in the harbor this evening may not have been an accident.
[117:46.22]We have learned that evidence of a fierce gun battle has been found by police investigators.
[117:50.86]Several bodies were recovered from the scene with bullet and shrapnel wounds.
[117:54.59]So far, no one is commenting on exactly what happened here, or why.
[117:58.23]Why am I trying to take out the cameras?
[118:04.65]What the fuck am I doing?
[118:06.93]Alright, here comes another scary thing.
[118:12.90]I'm wasting ammo in this gun.
[118:24.66]Am I gonna stream with the rock?
[118:31.94]No, I don't think that's going to happen.
[118:34.22]Sorry.
[118:42.40]I don't want this shit.
[118:43.18]What is it?
[118:43.52]No.
[118:43.72]Text him.
[118:44.22]Alright, we got the info we needed.
[119:10.95]Get out of here.
[119:12.59]Wait.
[119:16.39]Keep this room clean.
[119:17.92]Something's gonna jump out of here.
[119:19.14]Did I just grab onto it?
[119:33.09]Nope.
[119:33.45]Can't do anything about it.
[119:34.19]There's nothing I can do, right?
[119:36.89]I don't think so.
[119:46.58]Maybe I should go down.
[119:57.75]Clean it.
[119:58.75]This is not visceral cleanup detail.
[120:00.77]Oh shit, okay.
[120:04.27]It's mine, get out of here.
[120:10.76]Oh shit, okay.
[120:18.56]How do I get down there?
[120:22.08]Can I go, like, around and down?
[120:23.38]Okay, I know, like, official, right?
[120:35.77]People are writing, like, oh, official Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
[120:40.35]Official The Rock.
[120:42.87]If it were you...
[120:44.74]Would you, like, my name is not official Jerma985.
[120:48.49]It's just Jerma985.
[120:50.31]Why does everybody think that that's a way to make it seem like it's legit?
[120:54.31]No, you would just be The Rock.
[120:56.43]Official The Rock.
[120:58.61]What?
[120:58.79]This guy's starting to annoy me.
[121:10.81]Something in the water.
[121:15.03]Something in the water.
[121:21.49]They've been putting chlorine.
[121:38.14]I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys.
[121:41.22]I looked over at you guys at chat and came back and turned my eyes on the doors in front of me and it was more startling than if I actually saw what happened.
[121:59.18]Oh shit.
[122:20.36]Holy shit, what the hell was that?
[122:25.16]What the fuck?
[122:26.68]What was that?
[122:27.84]What was that floating person?
[122:31.29]What was that?
[122:32.89]That was fucking weird.
[122:34.21]Alright, I made it.
[122:38.99]Hey!
[122:47.82]Stop.
[122:50.68]Why are you getting all scary now?
[122:51.96]Where's the guys?
[122:52.57]Where's the funny slide tackle of the enemies and watch their heads hit the ground?
[123:11.88]You can't be scared of what you can't see.
[123:15.58]Told you.
[123:28.62]In person?
[123:58.38]Where is she?
[124:02.34]Oh fuck!
[124:04.22]Why does it bounce off of him?
[124:27.10]Okay.
[124:27.38]What's going on?
[124:30.66]Okay, here we go.
[124:36.85]Do the thing.
[124:42.97]Fetal finds her.
[124:44.43]Origin.
[124:59.97]I don't know.
[125:01.19]Okay.
[125:04.85]I knew it.
[125:06.55]Hit the lights.
[125:06.95]What do you mean, hit the lights?
[125:08.48]You just turned them off and now they're back on.
[125:14.20]What?
[125:14.36]Boom.
[125:17.46]Right in the head.
[125:21.36]I'm still alive?
[125:30.61]Right here.
[125:41.80]Do it.
[125:42.74]DPI.
[125:43.40]Fucking DPI.
[125:46.56]No I'm not.
[125:48.67]I'm underneath you.
[126:05.87]What the fuck is happening?
[126:08.34]Who the... No!
[126:11.26]Wrong button!
[126:18.08]This is DPI.
[126:18.96]Why do you do this to me?
[126:26.38]Hmm.
[126:39.24]Did he just say that?
[126:56.31]We good?
[127:01.02]I think so.
[127:01.90]Alright.
[127:04.30]Investigate time.
[127:12.90]What?
[127:28.22]Holy fuck.
[127:28.80]Okay, I don't have any health packs left.
[128:03.89]Why are there so many people in here?
[128:30.97]to do that you did not have to do that oh yeah yeah okay save it here they could have I actually could have just had them burned by running down the hall
[129:04.59]Should I go up here?
[129:07.89]Save it.
[129:11.42]Okay.
[129:11.90]Um.
[129:11.98]Cool.
[129:12.26]I got armor.
[129:36.08]Jesus Christ!
[129:44.40]Where is this guy?
[129:49.40]Fucking hammer.
[130:05.05]Where?
[130:21.89]That is a lot of fun.
[130:26.55]Where the fuck is he?
[130:36.78]What the fuck was that?
[130:54.39]Dude, I don't even know where I'm going right now.
[130:57.00]What's the mission?
[130:58.94]Find Pakistan Federal.
[131:05.80]Where do I go?
[131:06.12]Oh.
[131:09.49]I have no railgun ammo.
[131:12.55]Ooh.
[131:13.49]Now I do.
[131:24.03]I'm not gonna use it for a little bit though.
[131:25.55]Give me a shotgun.
[131:39.46]Good.
[131:40.22]Good.
[131:45.28]I don't know.
[131:46.16]I don't know, I know, I know.
[131:49.19]Saving.
[131:49.53]Okay, so just save it again.
[131:50.47]Just double save.
[131:51.91]Just in case your computer crashes when your hard drive is broken.
[131:54.35]That's saving on a different hard drive.
[131:55.68]I didn't think I thought about that.
[131:57.58]Team, get to cover!
[132:16.20]Why would you explode from that far away?
[132:31.23]Damn it.
[132:46.40]No!
[132:47.70]No, no, no, no, no!
[132:50.70]Wait.
[132:52.38]Do- Am I doing this right?
[133:00.25]Alright, I- I- Cause I was gonna go backwards.
[133:16.56]Armageddon.
[133:30.94]This guy Canadian?
[133:31.56]No.
[133:31.66]I think he's, uh, I think he's Wisconsin.
[133:33.66]What the fuck is that?
[134:01.80]Wait, he's putting down mines.
[134:05.35]Alright.
[134:06.41]Mines.
[134:15.00]So the goal is to get him to walk over his own mines.
[134:23.14]Sounds like a plan to me.
[134:30.38]See you guys 45 or so minutes from now when we actually get that to happen.
[134:36.27]Ooh, more railgun?
[134:37.23]Okay, this is safe.
[135:00.73]Hit the bell.
[135:04.60]I guess not.
[135:05.18]Wait, there might be others.
[135:06.04]There we go.
[135:11.58]What the fuck was that?
[135:14.18]Grenade.
[135:17.15]Nothing else I need.
[135:17.99]Alright, I can break that.
[135:21.13]How close can I get to these proximity?
[135:23.71]So then, I mean, obviously I cannot go over there.
[135:26.58]What's the distance, though?
[135:27.34]I just need to see.
[135:29.09]Is it one square, or is it more than one?
[135:31.19]Alright, that's not bad.
[135:34.97]I could just shoot it, too.
[135:35.69]Get out of the way.
[135:41.57]Alright, I can go this way.
[135:45.27]Do it.
[135:53.59]Oh yeah.
[135:54.15]Save it.
[135:54.95]I've gone.
[135:55.45]I've been saving.
[135:56.27]Rats.
[135:56.43]Can I get through this?
[135:57.39]No.
[136:23.68]It's a wall.
[136:24.22]Alright, uh, scary guy just jumped in the water.
[136:36.97]That means I have to jump in the water too, or do I?
[136:41.17]I do not have to jump in the water.
[136:44.01]I get to bypass that whole segment.
[136:47.13]Let's spawn him anyways, though.
[136:52.39]Nevermind.
[136:56.98]Right.
[137:03.80]Okay, three shots.
[137:11.22]One, two, three in the head.
[137:12.00]Here we go.
[137:15.65]He's gonna get stuck to the ceiling.
[137:34.47]You motherfucker, I swear to God.
[137:36.32]I think that's it.
[137:55.05]Give me some more railgun.
[137:56.29]Nice.
[137:57.97]Alright, I ain't gonna just sprint over here because...
[138:02.34]If there's one, there's two.
[138:04.15]If there's two, there's three.
[138:05.19]And if there's three, there's ten.
[138:06.31]That's kind of how this game has been working so far.
[138:13.15]Okay... Alright, up.
[138:26.36]Is this in the source engine?
[138:27.56]I don't... I don't think so.
[138:41.56]No, it's not.
[138:43.06]I don't know what this is in.
[138:43.98]It's probably like Unreal or something.
[138:45.25]One of the old Unreals.
[138:51.25]Flashlight off.
[138:53.73]Keep going.
[139:08.62]Is it the boomer engine?
[139:12.91]Health upgrade.
[139:13.47]Good.
[139:18.74]120 max HP.
[139:21.62]And a new health.
[139:23.46]Alright.
[139:23.94]Cool.
[139:28.57]Damn it.
[139:28.87]I can't open that.
[139:29.55]Come on.
[139:32.87]Gotta go down here into the water.
[139:35.33]Fine.
[139:40.38]This way.
[139:43.17]This does remind me of Half-Life.
[139:46.55]Even just the sound effects, too.
[139:50.21]That alarm sound.
[139:51.17]The going through the water sound.
[139:58.64]It has guns.
[139:59.46]Yeah, that's right.
[140:00.66]I didn't even think about that.
[140:03.08]Yeah, I didn't even think about that.
[140:03.96]It has guns.
[140:04.40]You're right.
[140:04.86]It's weird.
[140:09.69]It's got health glued to the wall.
[140:12.76]Wait, I ended up... Alright, fuck it.
[140:15.94]I don't care.
[140:16.88]Does that mean I can't go that way?
[140:34.69]Why do I feel like this is gonna kill me?
[140:48.80]How did I go all the way back around?
[140:50.38]There is fall damage.
[140:53.23]What?!
[140:57.46]Just run fa- run fast.
[141:29.07]My body is exploding.
[141:30.23]It's disintegrating.
[141:31.46]So, no, that's not how this works.
[141:33.58]Just use a health kit.
[141:36.86]Guys, I'm spamming tea.
[141:38.22]It's not gonna work.
[141:38.92]I'm out.
[141:39.36]I'm going that way.
[141:45.79]I will pick this up, though.
[141:48.73]Shit, I went the wrong way.
[141:54.92]Back down here.
[141:55.64]Where did I go wrong?
[142:03.95]One of these big rooms back here.
[142:05.17]I shot the mines.
[142:09.80]Yeah.
[142:13.78]Yeah, I did.
[142:14.90]I didn't know it was going to cause electricity all over the place.
[142:22.07]Use a grenade and boost yourself.
[142:24.53]I don't think that's going to work.
[142:31.19]Alright, this is where... Alright, remember this...
[142:35.24]Should I go up here or should I go down there?
[142:37.94]I'm gonna go up that way.
[142:38.62]I actually almost just made it.
[142:56.61]I almost just made it.
[143:01.69]Uh, okay, so there's a bottom there that there's no water underneath.
[143:05.07]It just goes all the way down.
[143:06.97]That's good to know.
[143:08.35]So you don't shortcut jump that.
[143:10.19]Just go around and go up.
[143:12.47]Very good to know.
[143:13.31]Cool.
[143:20.70]I'm not going to bunny hop through it.
[143:22.06]I'm going to go the right way.
[143:29.76]There's no bunny hopping in this game anyways.
[143:34.40]Why am I even trying?
[143:35.50]I know it doesn't exist.
[143:36.84]Why would I try it?
[143:39.17]See, I thought there was water here.
[143:45.13]Here we go.
[143:46.17]Ladder up this way.
[143:47.31]I didn't go up here.
[143:49.00]Maybe I did.
[143:49.56]Let's try it.
[143:54.60]Okay, and then...
[143:58.92]Is that the... Oh, here it is.
[144:00.24]I haven't... Okay, this is the electric... That's the electric... Oh, no.
[144:06.04]The health kit.
[144:08.92]Ooh.
[144:11.52]There we go.
[144:13.85]Solved it.
[144:15.93]Nice.
[144:16.17]Alright, let's keep going.
[144:17.29]35 armor.
[144:32.25]FeelsPumpkinMan.
[144:33.49]FeelsPumpkinMan.
[144:34.25]What's FeelsPumpkinMan?
[144:37.53]I can't see it.
[144:38.09]OK, mines.
[144:55.73]Yeah, I do have a BT TV.
[144:59.40]The thing is though, your chat right now is coming through Streamlabs.
[145:03.62]The Streamlabs OBS.
[145:05.87]So, I don't know if I can have BT TV through Streamlabs.
[145:11.07]That's a new gun.
[145:14.08]And there's more health.
[145:14.94]Alright, new gun.
[145:15.68]What is this?
[145:17.32]ASP rifle?
[145:22.74]Oh, that's pretty great, actually.
[145:25.34]I love that noise, too.
[145:26.60]Perfect.
[145:26.96]Alright, I don't need the assault rifle.
[145:28.73]I want this.
[145:30.35]How many bullets?
[145:31.15]30?
[145:31.17]15?
[145:31.61]Okay.
[145:35.63]Remote bomb?
[145:36.85]Remote bombs stick to almost any surface, including enemies, and can be manually detonated, making them ideal for traps.
[145:44.13]Oh, don't do this to me.
[145:45.11]Don't give me this kind of shit.
[145:47.07]You don't want me to have this.
[145:51.32]You sincerely do not want me to have this.
[145:55.04]But you gave it to me anyways, so... I'm just going to use it immediately.
[146:01.66]Down, a little bit over here.
[146:10.10]Wait, I was already over here.
[146:14.34]Um... Is there a straight?
[146:18.54]Straight through here.
[146:20.70]I came up that way, so... Huh.
[146:28.72]Are we just downstairs?
[146:32.51]Here comes the blew-myself-up joke.
[146:34.35]No, I'm not... It's blow the other guy up joke.
[146:37.65]Understood.
[146:55.15]How would you even see me?
[147:05.70]Is it playing?
[147:07.02]The game?
[147:07.68]That you don't throw with like the other hand?
[147:09.58]That's just the detonator.
[147:12.82]Okay, I get it.
[147:26.58]Okay, I understand.
[147:27.94]I didn't... I thought you, like, threw it with that.
[147:29.86]Oh, or, like, with that.
[147:31.20]Wait, I get it.
[147:31.72]It's okay.
[147:33.52]Nice placement.
[147:34.16]Can I break this window without them freaking out about this?
[147:46.47]I didn't just... What?
[147:47.15]Let me check it out.
[147:51.56]You heard the wind?
[148:12.32]That's not satis- That was not satisfying enough.
[148:15.04]I don't- That's a lot of people in there.
[148:23.92]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[148:27.04]Works pretty well.
[148:42.99]So we got regular grenades.
[148:44.67]We have, okay, do I have one regular grenade?
[148:46.85]Okay.
[148:51.38]Stormtroopers.
[148:52.38]Their aim is sort of as bad as stormtroopers.
[148:56.30]I'm gonna try the sniper rifle.
[148:58.31]I'm gonna snipe somebody.
[149:00.25]Who can I snipe?
[149:01.21]Right here.
[149:12.71]Nice.
[149:12.91]Should I go down, maybe?
[149:24.22]Ooh, there's more of this.
[149:25.16]OK.
[149:26.52]So we need... I mean, I have.
[149:29.16]That's what I currently have.
[149:30.72]More ammo for that thing.
[149:32.85]Pretty nice.
[149:34.69]Pretty nice.
[149:41.29]I wish it was only a one-shot.
[149:44.50]I don't want the burst.
[149:46.04]All I need is one bullet, not four.
[149:47.82]Because it goes... One of the three bullets.
[149:51.86]One of the three bullets.
[149:53.18]One of the three bullets.
[149:55.30]One of the three bullets.
[149:57.84]Something like that.
[149:58.46]Let's see.
[149:59.12]One of the three.
[150:07.00]That helicopter is huge.
[150:19.69]You only dropped two?
[150:24.56]Why didn't, like, ten people come out of there?
[150:39.88]No, don't waste it.
[150:40.68]I'm up close now.
[150:41.78]Get the shotgun.
[150:42.78]Hazard.
[150:50.33]I didn't even use the hazard, really.
[150:53.25]Nope, nothing.
[150:54.45]I thought I heard something.
[151:08.21]Quiet down.
[151:14.84]How do you hear me?
[151:15.64]Where are they?
[151:33.45]Where is he?
[151:35.33]Are they upstairs in the room?
[151:40.29]Movement.
[151:45.85]Who threw that?
[151:59.40]Is he dead?
[152:20.71]No, no, no, no, no!
[152:47.07]Alright, I ain't fucking around.
[152:51.09]Let's go.
[152:59.72]I'm no more screwing around.
[153:02.68]Wait for my signal.
[153:03.38]Yeah, it's called... You're dead.
[153:05.24]You did hear something.
[153:06.37]It was me.
[153:21.10]What the... Holy fuck, he missed.
[153:34.04]Fair?
[153:40.08]Who the fuck are you?
[153:47.48]Ooh, I got it.
[154:13.85]Come on!
[154:14.53]Did I get him?
[154:24.42]Don't.
[154:41.25]I can't even think about it.
[154:42.61]Where is he?
[154:43.89]He's right there.
[155:04.31]Alright.
[155:10.00]Those guys are tricky.
[155:10.88]Those guys are hard.
[155:15.10]What else you got?
[155:16.20]Submachine gun?
[155:17.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[155:18.48]What have I got?
[155:19.62]25 shots.
[155:21.71]Not bad.
[155:22.47]Alright.
[155:23.01]I got three health packs.
[155:24.23]That's good.
[155:24.79]Not terrible.
[155:25.55]Not great.
[155:26.79]Not good either, though.
[155:28.27]That's where he came from.
[155:35.29]Very nice.
[155:35.73]Okay.
[155:38.18]You missed a health pack?
[155:38.88]Did I miss a health pack?
[155:42.57]Where do you see that?
[155:46.67]Oh.
[155:49.23]Oh.
[155:55.90]You got baited?
[155:58.40]Baited?
[155:58.76]I don't think I did.
[156:00.18]I think I'm doing just fine.
[156:01.52]Alright, straight through.
[156:11.99]Oh shit, thanks.
[156:12.63]Nice.
[156:12.99]Okay, turn the light off.
[156:33.48]70.
[156:33.82]Ooh.
[156:34.76]That's exactly what I want.
[156:37.18]Got 45 in this now.
[156:38.48]I'm gonna use the shotgun.
[156:39.94]Yeah, shotgun.
[156:40.66]Look at this ammo.
[156:42.04]That's way too much ammo.
[156:44.65]Comcast.
[156:45.29]Yeah, that's what I... Sounds like they're saying.
[156:46.93]Alright.
[156:49.35]Uh... We're good?
[156:51.73]We're good?
[156:52.53]We're good.
[156:55.03]Save it.
[156:58.93]Someone's gonna pop around the corner.
[157:00.27]I'm not gonna shoot him right in the face.
[157:05.13]This is- I gotta alert people.
[157:18.45]Just don't- just walk.
[157:32.98]You can make it in there.
[157:35.18]You seriously can.
[157:37.36]You really can.
[157:38.40]I know you can get in there.
[157:40.80]You can fit inside of that.
[157:42.22]You are not as big as this.
[157:49.24]Ha.
[157:55.40]No.
[157:56.02]Okay.
[157:58.15]I don't want that, though.
[158:02.83]no I like what I have right now helicopter battle looks like it oh but you can go through that one right you can go through that uh nine shots in this
[158:37.33]Hey, what?
[158:38.33]Nice aim, idiot.
[158:52.01]Oh no, not another one.
[158:56.29]OK, I need.
[159:14.05]Is that enough person?
[159:27.80]No!
[159:29.42]Run away.
[159:41.70]N-A-AIM.
[159:42.56]N-A-AIM.
[159:50.33]What do I have for explosives?
[159:54.56]I have one of these.
[159:55.50]Okay, I'm gonna use this one first.
[160:23.41]Did I not throw it far enough?
[160:29.85]Why do you have so much HP?
[160:31.64]It's just not even fair.
[160:33.46]To us that don't have those suits.
[160:50.86]I just panicked and had to try.
[160:52.96]I have to replace something.
[160:54.18]Maybe not.
[160:54.96]Did I do it?
[161:19.03]Is this the evac point?
[161:29.04]Interval 4.
[161:29.38]How do I like the game so far?
[161:31.20]It's good.
[161:31.52]It's fun just to shoot.
[161:33.04]And there's some weird stuff going on, so it's cool.
[161:34.82]Look at that water.
[161:36.28]It is pretty beautiful.
[162:00.03]Drop the scope gun.
[162:00.85]Ammo for it is too scarce for it to be viable.
[162:04.65]Yeah, I guess, you know, that's probably true considering... When you... It's not like it's that big of a difference.
[162:13.43]What's going on?
[162:13.79]Really?
[162:15.46]Guys.
[162:15.82]Really?
[162:16.22]What?
[162:16.42]Okay.
[162:20.82]That was a little... That guy has three in his head.
[162:23.56]He has three in his head.
[162:26.02]Why are you still alive?
[162:52.08]Holy shit, you are a... maniac.
[163:12.49]That's the kind of shit that happens to people in BR, like in Fortnite and shit.
[163:16.39]You're just jumping around trying to get that... and... I just got Fortnited.
[163:20.43]I got like...
[163:26.02]How did I insta-fucking-die?
[163:41.53]That guy's not dead.
[163:44.30]Can we be clear about that?
[163:45.58]He was still alive.
[164:11.32]I had to watch.
[164:11.96]I thought it was gonna bounce back.
[164:17.88]I had to just- I was just being a cameraman.
[164:19.90]I'm sorry.
[164:31.15]He got it out!
[164:34.05]What the fuck?
[164:39.01]Instantly killing me.
[164:48.46]Oh shit.
[164:49.42]Oh shit.
[164:51.04]Oh shit.
[164:53.44]Oh shit.
[164:55.50]Okay, I need to... Okay, this is... I'm gonna run... I'm going... Here's the plan.
[165:02.44]You ready?
[165:02.70]Watch this.
[165:08.93]Oh, this is not the shotgun.
[165:16.87]Oh shit.
[165:27.69]Pfft!
[166:00.98]Where is he?
[166:15.01]The fuck?
[166:22.77]Where'd he go?
[166:23.39]Whoa!
[166:23.75]He fell off the edge.
[166:44.26]Oh, shit.
[166:57.43]I got him.
[166:58.55]Okay.
[167:01.09]Um...
[167:03.26]I need to tap a new gun or something.
[167:06.90]What's this?
[167:07.66]Oh, that's a nice one.
[167:08.68]No, it's one I just threw over here.
[167:17.70]Okay.
[167:18.12]I'm gonna save it here.
[167:18.89]I have no health.
[167:29.47]Is he gonna do it?
[167:29.91]What do you think?
[167:37.47]No, he's not.
[167:39.95]We need 20 more oh-shits.
[167:42.30]I don't think we need more than those.
[167:44.86]Pre-recorded?
[167:45.32]What'd it say?
[167:46.10]Pre-recorded.
[167:46.76]Bleach.
[168:05.07]uh no alright I don't want to make noise
[168:35.11]Stay down.
[168:36.99]Health?
[168:37.27]Nice. 130!
[169:03.73]I feel like I'm... You were waiting for me?
[169:07.63]200 max?
[169:18.69]That makes sense.
[169:23.69]Watch out for that gas.
[169:39.65]What did he just throw?
[169:40.45]A grenade?
[169:48.17]Check it.
[169:50.39]Alright.
[169:55.60]What- what are you- Did you pre-fire me?
[170:02.82]Okay, guys, I- he pre- Just kill me, I'll do it again.
[170:18.35]Where should I go?
[170:19.61]I love it.
[170:20.77]He's just holding down the trigger on me, screaming, where should I go?
[170:24.37]I'm so scared.
[170:26.57]This guy is fucking terrifying.
[170:30.05]If the grenade pops up here, I'm going to be very mad.
[170:36.06]Alright, there's no grenade.
[170:56.14]Oh!
[171:19.15]That's so funny.
[171:21.55]His pitch shifted by like 10%.
[171:24.49]Dude pulls out his shotgun.
[171:35.44]Oh shit!
[171:37.92]He gets his fucking face blown off the guy next to him.
[171:41.12]Oh shit!
[171:46.88]This game's fucking awesome.
[171:49.15]That's fucking real- that's just really stupid.
[171:53.09]It's really stupid.
[171:55.75]Okay, hold on.
[172:12.89]I have to compose myself here.
[172:20.67]Okay.
[172:26.75]Let's get this together.
[172:38.98]I was hoping he was gonna say, oh shit.
[172:43.62]Oh shit!
[172:56.95]I don't know why it's making me laugh so bad right now.
[172:59.06]What is he aiming at?
[173:06.00]Alright.
[173:29.81]I just get- I get stuck on something and I can't- I can't get away from it.
[173:54.10]Why wouldn't you do anything?
[173:56.98]Protect yourself!
[174:06.55]Okay.
[174:11.75]He was scared.
[174:16.13]I held the button for too long.
[174:49.27]Have you guys ever played, uh, Smash TV?
[174:56.19]He's not gonna use the stairs, is he?
[175:16.91]It reminds me of the... No way.
[175:19.59]No way.
[175:21.96]That game is so good.
[175:23.96]I should play that game on stream.
[175:45.74]I'm starting to kind of lose it.
[175:49.24]It's too ridiculous sometimes.
[176:02.08]You got Mortal Kombated.
[176:03.52]Yeah, he did like a high punch mid kick.
[176:06.20]High punch mid kick.
[176:07.10]He was trying to do a combo.
[176:09.42]See, it's alright.
[176:10.72]It's okay.
[176:11.16]Sometimes you mess up the button combos.
[176:13.12]He was trying to do like the sub-zero freeze.
[176:24.31]I don't.
[176:24.47]That's true.
[176:24.85]You do have that right.
[176:53.34]Okay.
[176:54.02]Let's... Oh, save it.
[176:55.06]Alright, I'm good.
[176:58.12]Two health packs.
[177:02.01]What's with this... Here comes the music.
[177:04.63]What's with the here comes the music?
[177:10.47]There's a lot of people out there.
[177:26.25]Cut!
[177:55.35]Can I watch that clip?
[177:56.93]Oh shit.
[177:58.41]It won't get out of my head.
[178:02.60]I need to see it again.
[178:04.74]I don't care about anything else right now.
[178:06.12]I just want to see it again.
[178:13.71]You can watch it on your own.
[178:15.21]I need to see it again.
[178:28.32]It's funny.
[178:28.76]Okay, I just wanted to remind myself if I was funny or not.
[179:01.21]Alright, I just need to... sometimes I need to be reminded if it was funny.
[179:07.93]Okay, so... I'm gonna go up this way?
[179:16.13]Don't I... don't I need healing sticks or whatever they are?
[179:19.55]Um... Wait a minute.
[179:31.32]Oh, through the glass.
[179:32.14]I need to jump through the glass.
[179:38.54]I did this already.
[179:39.22]How did I...
[179:58.07]I hold up the sign that says, uh-oh!
[180:00.71]And then I fall.
[180:01.27]Locate and reset the network.
[180:26.98]I'll try.
[180:27.78]I need healing.
[180:30.72]I need healing very, very badly.
[180:33.00]Oops.
[180:33.53]Now no one will ever get into the network.
[180:37.09]Okay, I gotta wedge it with something.
[180:43.11]I gotta stick something in there.
[180:43.99]I gotta wedge something in there.
[180:47.67]First of all, let's get some refreshments.
[180:50.39]I don't think there is any refreshments.
[180:55.75]No.
[180:58.86]There is not!
[181:08.58]Is somebody in here watching this?
[181:16.58]Okay, that's pretty funny.
[181:18.57]That's pretty great.
[181:19.71]It actually moves the projector around too.
[181:30.07]That- I love it.
[181:30.79]That's great.
[181:32.05]This is- That's highly detailed from 2004.
[181:33.38]Hey.
[181:52.78]Can I open this?
[181:54.18]No, none of them can be opened until the network's back online.
[182:05.37]Anything in here?
[182:06.83]Health pack.
[182:10.23]Nothing.
[182:16.23]Wasn't there a horror game like this where you walked around an office?
[182:37.77]Stay out of my way.
[182:53.42]What is up above here?
[182:55.11]Oh, computer.
[182:56.09]Lots of shit, okay.
[183:22.18]Oh, this is the other side, okay.
[183:25.51]Assault rifle... I've talked a lot of shit about how much health I had and how many health packs I had, and now that I switched over to hard mode, I've not had as many health packs.
[183:39.54]They spawn less.
[183:48.90]Enemies take more damage.
[183:51.70]It's a lot harder.
[183:59.95]Something's, nope.
[184:00.61]I was gonna say it's gonna open up and scream.
[184:02.85]No.
[184:10.19]I knew it, I fucking knew, I told you.
[184:13.51]I knew that shit was gonna happen.
[184:20.48]Venetian blinds, I'm telling you, they're the worst invention in history.
[184:26.13]I will never have Venetian blinds in my house.
[184:31.43]I don't understand why you want these huge, obnoxious pillars that get in the way of everything you do when you open a door.
[184:40.03]Why are they still putting these in houses?
[184:43.07]Why?
[184:44.01]Everybody hates them.
[184:45.67]Every single person hates these things.
[184:49.32]Ask anybody that has them.
[184:51.04]Oh, yeah, they suck ass.
[184:54.08]Oh, okay.
[184:54.53]Why are they in your house?
[184:55.45]I don't know.
[184:58.41]Get a curtain.
[185:05.87]Nah, I don't want to get a curtain.
[185:07.39]That means I have to go to Home Depot and get a curtain.
[185:11.74]And put it up.
[185:12.60]I'll just deal with the swinging pendulums of death every time I open my slider.
[185:26.00]How do you leave a voicemail on a public phone?
[185:27.67]Peter.
[185:27.99]Peter.
[185:58.95]It's a glossy TV.
[186:00.05]You should get a matte TV.
[186:01.21]Never buy a glossy TV.
[186:03.67]And if anyone wants to argue with glossy screen versus matte screen, I'm sorry, but you're gonna lose every time.
[186:11.26]I will win that argument every single time.
[186:24.28]Oh, it's a satellite.
[186:27.06]Okay.
[186:29.53]What do I have?
[186:29.95]Three?
[186:30.29]Okay, I have four.
[186:31.89]I have three grenades.
[186:33.14]I'll get the shotgun out.
[186:43.74]There comes a jumpscare.
[186:47.03]No, no jumpscare in here.
[186:49.07]That's strange.
[186:49.93]I would have thought it would be.
[186:50.73]What's that?
[186:51.09]Alright, I thought that was this gun.
[187:01.08]Hello?
[187:01.34]Why am I walking?
[187:08.85]Stop walking.
[187:30.67]Just kill me, kill me.
[187:31.71]That was bullshit.
[187:32.61]I'll do it.
[187:42.22]That was terrifying.
[187:43.42]I'll be ready this time.
[187:59.98]That, like... What?
[188:03.10]This is unbelievable!
[188:04.16]There's no way!
[188:06.75]I'm invisible!
[188:08.81]Well, they're into the game now.
[188:09.97]That's great.
[188:11.03]I can't wait to deal with that.
[188:20.89]Look for the little wiggly lines.
[188:31.96]Dead?
[188:33.16]OK.
[188:37.67]Place to go up there?
[188:39.71]Can I jump up that?
[188:42.01]No, I can't.
[188:53.75]Got him?
[189:12.43]If you only knew how to defeat me.
[189:17.33]You will never know.
[189:19.27]Chuck Hamburger?
[189:20.55]Oh, Chuck Hamburger.
[189:39.96]They got your message.
[189:41.57]Maybe you've forgotten that when this happened before, Metal was only a child.
[189:45.55]And the fallout of that fuckup was that Origin had to be permanently shut down.
[189:50.71]This time we're talking about a highly trained military commander with a telepathic link to hundreds of soldiers that don't think for themselves.
[189:57.83]If you're worried about being behind schedule in hell, imagine what'll happen if we end up with a full-scale revolt.
[190:03.78]Next message from...
[190:06.19]Marshall Dissler.
[190:07.79]Hi, it's Marshall.
[190:08.97]Just got off the phone with Chuck Habegger.
[190:10.53]Really worried about his findings.
[190:12.63]He said he talked to you about suspending the program temporarily, and I've got to agree.
[190:17.31]If there's even the slightest chance of another synchronicity event, we've got to take it seriously.
[190:22.60]I'm gonna head over to the Perseus compound and check things out myself.
[190:26.40]Why don't you give me a call to my cell?
[190:27.88]Let's discuss this.
[190:29.26]End of messages.
[190:37.59]Okay.
[190:40.54]So, we've got... Nice.
[190:46.82]Good.
[190:48.40]We've got a... I've gotta go up somehow.
[190:53.06]I have to go up that shaft over here.
[190:56.92]How the hell am I gonna do that?
[190:58.18]Is there another way to get up there?
[191:04.68]Can I... I guess I can just go through here.
[191:15.15]No.
[191:17.56]Alright, be ready because I'm trying to put the nail in the guy's head.
[191:21.81]I see electricity.
[191:22.57]I know what that means.
[191:24.30]There's electricity.
[191:48.53]Okay.
[191:51.49]I don't know why that scared me.
[191:53.61]I was ready for it, but it still did it.
[191:55.27]I don't know why.
[192:02.04]What?
[192:03.72]Why is this opening?
[192:20.83]Oh, look, look!
[192:23.03]It's an office space.
[192:25.75]TPS report.
[192:27.01]Red stapler.
[192:30.26]What's this say?
[192:32.68]November.
[192:34.88]Call me.
[192:37.60]That's an office space reference.
[192:39.34]That's a pretty good movie, too.
[192:40.80]If you've never seen Office Space, go watch it.
[192:43.85]Right now, just go get it.
[192:48.31]What?
[192:48.47]What?
[193:01.80]Don't touch that dial, we're just getting started.
[193:32.84]Haha, good one.
[193:35.80]Thanks, I appreciate the feedback.
[193:48.07]What the fuck was that?
[193:55.85]What's wrong with me?
[193:58.23]Why is everything all spooky?
[194:03.20]Show yourself!
[194:17.37]That's all it took is right in the stomach.
[194:18.75]Alright.
[194:20.51]Shotgun's way better for these guys.
[194:32.71]You just plant one right in the face.
[194:38.35]I thought that was a mine.
[194:39.50]Computer?
[194:52.60]Ooh.
[194:55.73]Looks like the Icarus program got shut down in favor of something called Perseus, which from what I can tell is funded by DoD.
[195:02.32]I'm guessing that's where Fettel and his soldiers came from.
[195:05.88]Okay.
[195:08.44]Server room.
[195:10.02]I can't go in the server room.
[195:16.50]Guy alive?
[195:25.44]Hello?
[195:33.96]That's silent in here.
[195:37.16]Why?
[195:45.85]Oh, you piece of shit.
[195:46.91]Where are you?
[195:53.83]Bye!
[195:56.47]Don't shoot her.
[195:57.41]My name is Norton Mapes.
[195:59.45]I'm an engineer.
[196:00.13]Shit, it's a civilian.
[196:02.44]Give him a comm link.
[196:03.24]Open the door.
[196:12.79]Give him a comm link.
[196:15.99]Hello?
[196:16.73]Who are you?
[196:17.33]It's a human Garfield.
[196:18.33]They're good guys.
[196:19.35]Are you alright?
[196:20.41]Oh, sure.
[196:21.11]I'm having a hell of a time.
[196:22.84]You said you're an engineer?
[196:23.52]Can you help me get into the network?
[196:26.35]Oh, bottom line, IS wacky.
[196:28.45]Tell you what, you disable the local security system, and I'll see what I can do about the server.
[196:34.22]I can disable it remotely once I'm logged in.
[196:36.54]No, you can't.
[196:37.52]It's on a separate network.
[196:52.96]What just happened?
[196:56.56]What's going on?
[196:57.98]He's eating the grenades!
[197:15.43]What else does he eat?
[197:16.49]Will you eat anything else?
[197:22.03]Wait, hold on.
[197:22.77]Okay.
[197:23.49]Back up.
[197:29.15]Okay, that's it.
[197:33.05]We're Okay, he's just an NPC.
[197:34.67]Whoops.
[197:35.27]Restart it.
[197:54.55]Restart restart restart restart Human I can't believe human Garfield Okay, what does he want just wait here
[198:26.82]What's he eating?
[198:27.30]Those are Cheetos.
[198:33.96]He's actually eating Cheetos.
[198:35.85]That's fantastic.
[198:37.69]That's the best character.
[198:39.99]I wish I could play as that character.
[198:43.11]I'd feel so much more at home.
[198:47.18]Human Garfield.
[198:50.26]That's so funny.
[198:59.67]Scary, dark hallway.
[199:00.93]Don't want to go down there yet.
[199:06.27]Don't do that.
[199:06.77]Okay.
[199:08.35]This is his desk.
[199:12.69]Oh, God.
[199:16.26]Look at this, like, gamer chair.
[199:19.02]Look at this gamer setup.
[199:21.90]They don't even make Cheetos bags this big.
[199:29.21]That's bigger than the monitor.
[199:30.99]This is like a 24-inch size Cheetos bag.
[199:34.23]They don't even make these.
[199:36.75]Well, let's listen to the message.
[199:37.77]You have one new message.
[199:40.87]First message from Ian Hives.
[199:44.66]Norton, it's Ian Hives.
[199:46.34]Look, um, Alice Wade stopped by my office this morning, and I feel a little awkward saying this, but, uh, well, I really need you to tone down the innuendo around her.
[199:57.94]It's not that I personally give a rat's ass, but the last thing we need right now is a sexual harassment case drawing unwanted attention from the task force.
[200:08.09]It's supposed to be a secret after all, okay?
[200:10.61]Thanks, Jordan.
[200:13.03]I just wanna shatter his computer so he freaks out.
[200:18.26]You know he's had that monitor for like 15 years.
[200:20.42]Fuckers.
[200:28.64]Alright, let's do some sneaking around and actually stealth kill people
[200:57.93]I wish I had a little map with a radar.
[201:05.57]Okay.
[201:13.46]So far, so good This is it.
[201:21.85]Let's try to get a clean...
[201:39.03]I wish I had a silenced gun who's down like down here I mean how did you know I was up there in the first place
[202:07.16]Holy shit.
[202:09.14]What was that?
[202:36.43]He's aiming.
[202:38.91]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[202:41.25]He's trying to find you.
[202:51.29]Squad, check in.

[203:11.86]Bullshit.
[203:14.92]Alright, that's it.
[203:16.46]I've had just about enough of this shit.
[203:18.36]I've had just about enough of this.
[203:24.61]Wrong button.
[203:26.27]Whatever, just die.
[203:29.33]Are you really throwing a grenade?
[203:35.64]I thought he was like, I'm gonna do it.
[203:37.82]I'm getting ready.
[203:49.54]Right there, right there!
[203:51.62]Right there, right there!
[203:55.16]What was that?
[204:10.39]Did he fall?

[205:16.68]117 shots in this thing.
[205:18.06]That's pretty good.
[205:21.26]Oh, damn.
[205:22.00]Alright.
[205:23.04]Decision time.
[205:30.13]Wait, what the... Alright, grenade.
[205:36.89]Grenades.
[205:38.95]Shotgun.
[205:39.51]And then I have... Do I have full ammo with this?
[205:43.78]I think so.
[205:47.23]Actually, it wasn't really that cool.
[205:50.25]Oh well.
[205:53.45]I have full ammo for everything.
[205:57.76]Good!
[205:58.54]What's that?
[205:59.16]Activate.
[206:03.24]That should do it.
[206:04.92]Got it.
[206:05.70]Mr. Mapes, do you copy?
[206:07.62]Mr. Mapes?
[206:09.01]Mr. Mapes?
[206:09.57]Oh.
[206:09.91]Fuck it.
[206:10.41]We'll just have to do this the hard way.
[206:14.77]Okay.
[206:15.21]Find that server and reboot it.
[206:18.19]Locate and reset the network hub.
[206:19.57]I will try.
[206:22.33]Server room is down here.
[206:23.71]Right?
[206:26.57]Right?
[206:27.21]Where was it?
[206:33.87]Where was the server room?
[206:40.71]Back here?
[206:43.27]No, it had a label.
[206:44.43]It was server room.
[206:46.37]Come on in.
[206:49.18]Back at the beginning.
[206:53.92]Okay, well.
[206:54.48]Target.
[207:18.69]What?
[207:18.83]Why am I using this gun?
[207:55.61]Thank God.
[207:57.65]I'm losing a shotgun from down the hall.
[208:01.61]Server room.
[208:02.27]There we go.
[208:07.60]Alright, save it.
[208:08.82]Now... This is Jint.
[208:12.90]We're on the roof.
[208:13.82]Heading inside.
[208:15.33]Copy.
[208:15.77]Proceed to rendezvous.
[208:17.43]Wait, hold on.
[208:17.91]Let me go in here first.
[208:27.29]Alright, that hurt.
[208:34.18]Reboot the network.
[208:37.66]One, two, three, go!
[208:38.88]Okay, I'm showing that the network has been rebooted.
[208:43.03]Good job.
[208:43.51]It'll take a minute for the system to come back online.
[208:47.71]Did Jerma find the fat guy?
[209:07.19]He did it!
[209:08.23]He said it!
[209:08.83]Okay.
[209:17.96]Am I gonna find the status of this person?
[209:22.02]I guess.
[209:22.38]I have seven shots in this thing.
[209:27.70]That's not gonna cut it.
[209:28.81]Back to the shotgun.
[209:33.80]That Mames guy was right about security being on a separate network.
[209:36.75]Make that a sub-sound.
[209:37.61]I can monitor the camera feed, but I don't have any direct access to the system.
[209:43.77]Oh, shit.
[209:46.77]No, not that way.
[209:48.67]I can't open it?
[209:49.25]No.
[209:51.71]There's no sub-sound?
[209:54.63]Yeah, I kind of muted it after a while.
[209:58.28]What the fuck?
[210:07.73]Scary!
[210:13.79]Yeah, I... It's a really fun thing.
[210:16.67]It's a really cool thing.
[210:18.63]But... Sometimes if you think about it, if there are... Let's say there's a bunch of subs.
[210:24.17]Let's say there's a ton of community subs and a bunch of subs.
[210:27.91]It's almost like you constantly have... Every, like, two minutes or every one minute... Just a noise that's just like...
[210:37.23]Hey, keep track of my hedge bandit in, boink!
[210:40.27]Hey, keep track of my hedge bandit in, boink!
[210:42.93]Hey, keep track of my hedge bandit in, boink!
[210:45.65]Hey, keep track of my hedge bandit in, boink!
[210:48.85]And that shit happens for fucking seven straight hours.
[210:55.33]You know how easily distracted I am?
[210:57.67]It's very, very easy.
[210:59.35]Hold on, this is... Hold on, this is Laura going on right now.
[211:09.29]Full health.
[211:13.68]Don't do noise?
[211:14.40]Just the banner?
[211:15.08]No, the banner should be on.
[211:16.56]It's not because of this.
[211:17.44]Hold on.
[211:18.98]The banner should actually still be there.
[211:22.16]But it's because I had to capture this strangely.
[211:25.41]So the banner should be there.
[211:30.11]It's not.
[211:30.57]It should be there now.
[211:59.86]This room's on fire.
[212:05.20]Uh, I don't- Why are you running at me?
[212:16.49]I'm fine.
[212:30.02]Uh... Sounds like he's right next to me.
[212:33.18]I'm here!
[212:34.18]Hey, I'm here!
[213:07.46]Hey, guys.
[213:07.96]What do you think, Janet?
[213:10.00]There was a lot of anger in this room.
[213:12.58]That's great.
[213:13.98]Got anything useful to add?
[213:15.89]I don't see any bullet holes.
[213:17.45]There's no brass lying around either.
[213:19.27]These guys didn't fire a shot.
[213:20.99]Then what killed them?
[213:23.49]I don't know.
[213:23.95]Well, figure it out.
[213:26.55]Alright, buddy, get moving.
[213:27.79]Fettel's got to be close.
[213:30.16]I'm not even sure where to start.
[213:31.84]Continue the search for Paxton Fettel.
[213:35.58]Almost complete liquefaction.
[213:38.62]Liquefaction.
[213:41.24]Maybe a chemical agent?
[213:45.24]It could be maybe a grenade.
[213:46.40]This is going to take some time.
[213:47.64]She's taking photos of the ground.
[213:54.68]What are you doing?
[214:02.86]You're going to delete a lot of those.
[214:07.54]That's why I don't... Guys, people ask me.
[214:11.07]Dude, you don't take any pictures of your phone.
[214:12.93]Why don't you take photos?
[214:14.77]I take one photo when I know I want to take a photo.
[214:18.36]When I know I need to take a photo.
[214:20.74]I do not take like 15 or 20 pictures of the same thing.
[214:25.46]I get it right the first time.
[214:27.62]Because then when you... If you take like 20 pictures of something you think is interesting, you end up... You don't even think about it.
[214:34.49]You don't go back and look at those pictures.
[214:36.39]Maybe for potentially months and months and months.
[214:38.99]You'll go to like...
[214:40.89]The Smithsonian.
[214:41.77]And you'll take a picture of like a space shuttle.
[214:44.05]Oh, wow, that's so cool.
[214:45.43]The space shuttle, that's awesome.
[214:47.15]That's really fucking interesting.
[214:48.71]You will not look at that photo for two years.
[214:51.36]And then two years goes by and you have like 16 different stupid angles of the same space shuttle in the Smithsonian.
[214:59.13]And your phone is at like 99% capacity.
[215:02.95]And you go, fuck, let's just go back and... 1,600 photos.
[215:07.25]I guess I'm gonna go back and delete all these.
[215:10.08]Take one.
[215:11.62]Just one.
[215:13.64]Get a good one.
[215:14.86]One that you remember.
[215:16.52]You don't have to, like, go like... Hold on.
[215:24.53]One of those will do.
[215:35.96]Should I?
[215:36.38]Oh, okay.
[215:45.12]It's not with my hand.
[215:47.89]No.
[215:48.87]Just a bug.
[215:49.33]It's just a bug, guys.
[215:53.15]Dammit, my fucking stupid-ass thing didn't work.
[215:57.05]What the f- Come on.
[215:58.35]Really?
[215:58.75]Do these not break?
[216:04.52]Would've been fucking funny if I did it the first time.
[216:06.20]It's one of those things.
[216:12.79]Where is it though?
[216:28.91]Full health.
[216:35.65]Let's go.
[216:37.27]Watch out.
[216:38.47]They're gonna spawn.
[216:40.57]They're just throwing... There's a health pack in every single room in this level.
[216:45.31]Hmm.
[217:12.09]Come on!
[217:12.97]He's trying to flank!
[217:20.30]Holy shit, that's too many people!
[217:26.78]Okay, there's a lot of people in there.
[217:28.06]We gotta change tactics.
[217:31.26]I gotta pick them off one by one.
[217:33.38]Sniping style.
[217:35.46]Hostage is secure.
[217:35.88]Check it.
[217:44.52]walked in front of him and said oh shit like seriously you've got a guy fight imagine there's a guy right here shooting this guy just goes like this like the chair is fighting you oh shit
[218:12.58]How does he know he's in your crosshairs?
[218:16.94]Oh shit, I'm gonna get like right inside of your your Look aim down sights.
[218:22.91]I know he's looking at me now I shouldn't have walked in front of my colleague who's also shooting.
[218:28.29]I made so many mistakes in a row Wait, I can't hear I
[218:52.99]Say it!
[218:56.31]Say it!
[219:09.95]Say the line.
[219:11.61]Say the line.
[219:13.76]Alright, it's time to stop fucking around watch this one activate The question
[220:07.66]Okay, I'm good.
[220:08.44]What are you, shitties?
[220:10.34]I just frogged that computer.
[220:40.11]Alright, I got plenty of ammo.
[221:13.15]Move.
[221:40.74]Is that a different shotgun?
[221:43.22]I don't think so.
[222:16.14]They can't, apparently.
[222:54.85]I'm in the supply closet!
[222:56.53]Help!
[222:57.91]Finally.
[222:58.35]What's up?
[222:59.45]Can you do something about these bombs?
[223:01.15]I'll try, man.
[223:01.88]Alright, another civilian.
[223:03.34]Dead mother, we've located a hostage.
[223:04.74]Sounds like he's wired up with explosives.
[223:07.18]Roger.
[223:07.40]I'll send somebody to help out.
[223:09.54]Give him a comm link.
[223:11.28]Here.
[223:14.54]Hello?
[223:16.16]You guys special forces or something?
[223:17.83]Yep.
[223:18.23]That's right.
[223:19.23]Just sit tight, Mr. Bishop.
[223:21.57]Sour Tower?
[223:22.37]Aldous Bishop.
[223:26.64]Okay buddy, there's some elevators near your position.

[223:41.53]Bye.
[223:45.82]Do what?
[223:47.50]Okay, go to the elevators.
[223:54.51]I'm really trying to put on a good display of video gaming skill.
[223:58.49]I had to just blink my eyes a few times.
[224:05.14]I'm still in it, too.
[224:05.98]I'm still in that zone.
[224:07.20]It's gonna happen.
[224:14.72]Elevators.
[224:15.22]Let's go.
[224:19.08]Are they?
[224:20.72]Oh, it feels bad for them.
[224:27.47]I feel bad for them.
[224:28.37]Oh boy, your head.
[224:47.55]It's no fair?
[224:52.77]They didn't get...

[226:11.04]And I- I didn't think this game was gonna be so- Wait.
[226:14.22]What?
[226:31.76]You guys didn't think I could pick up a free one?

[226:42.20]Oh, shit!
[226:47.61]Where's the hostage?

[226:54.65]He's over here somewhere.
[226:55.45]Can somebody turn this on?
[226:58.67]How do I get over there?
[226:59.50]I don't know how to get over there.
[227:01.12]Just...
[227:05.48]There, through the wall that we exploded.
[227:06.88]These guys are both dead, by the way.
[227:16.62]This is going to be a... Scenario.
[227:21.19]That's all I need to tell you.
[227:26.83]Man, I should have called in sick today.
[227:37.08]Really?
[227:37.30]You the bomb expert?
[227:38.71]That's right.
[227:39.89]Don't worry, you'll be fine.
[227:42.41]Just get this shit off me.
[227:44.53]Get this SHIT off me!
[227:46.57]Rick, this is definitely a pro.
[227:49.07]Is that supposed to make me feel better?
[227:50.44]You may be a pro, but I'm a master.
[227:54.54]A fire alarm.
[227:55.90]It was triggered at a security office on that floor.
[227:58.66]You'll need to shut it off to get the elevators back online.
[228:02.41]Okay, I'll do it.
[228:05.30]You just... You just pet it for a while, whatever you're doing.
[228:10.24]Here we go.
[228:10.94]You and me, let's go!
[228:12.46]Forward!
[228:14.84]Good call.
[228:15.64]Let's do it.
[228:16.08]Emergency.
[228:17.56]You and me.
[228:17.94]Yeah, that means you have to go too.
[228:25.91]Yes, I know.
[228:26.81]You're not gonna come with me.
[228:27.69]You're just telling me what I... What happened to human Garfield?
[228:30.33]Ooh, nice.
[228:30.61]Health permanent in night 135.
[229:12.96]Here we go.
[229:24.06]Shit just comes back in my head.
[229:25.49]I can't stop it from coming back.
[229:31.11]I feel like I've been hearing this alarm for two straight hours.
[229:35.76]I put some photocopies in your mail basket.
[229:38.20]It's a bunch of news articles I dug up about Auburn from the last 25 years.
[229:42.60]There's a surprising amount of corroboration of the physical symptoms that old woman told us about.
[229:50.39]Oh, mega LOL, shit.
[229:54.03]But if it was some kind of chemical or radiological contamination...
[230:10.39]Alright, turn it off.
[230:12.55]There's been just a constant morning alarm going this whole time I've been here.
[230:17.28]It's like, yes, I know, I need to wake up for work, sure.
[230:22.82]150 pounds, I was like, wait, what?
[230:28.79]That's not a lot.
[230:35.07]Alright, get it off.
[230:37.63]Thank you.
[230:40.48]Did I need those?
[230:43.38]You have one new message.
[230:46.38]First message from Marshall Dissler.
[230:50.16]This is Marshall.
[230:51.55]Something's happening over here at the Perseus compound.
[230:53.75]I can hear gunshots, but the security system just went down, so I don't know what the situation is.
[231:08.23]I was just trying to scare her.
[231:08.95]I was just trying to see if, you know, she's flinched or something.
[231:11.40]Whoa!
[231:12.20]Where's my flashlight?
[231:18.30]I don't get a flashlight anymore.
[231:21.42]Well, that's not good.
[231:26.40]Oh.
[231:42.01]I thought you said this didn't work.
[231:43.88]Uh-oh, this is the part of the... I did it.
[231:54.59]I made it.
[231:59.55]For a second I was very confused as to why I could not go this way.
[232:02.07]I'm pretty much done here.
[232:03.75]Any theories?
[232:04.85]I'm going to need to do some lab work.
[232:06.96]Alright, head back to the roof and sit tight.
[232:09.25]Beek.
[232:11.59]Beek.
[232:12.73]Beek.
[232:13.81]Head beek.
[232:14.55]Beek.
[232:16.19]Oh, I can't go through.
[232:16.95]I actually can't do this.
[232:20.32]I have to do this another way.
[232:26.18]Shit.
[232:26.70]Really?
[232:28.22]Can't- Can I climb anything?
[232:33.60]Yes, I can!
[232:45.73]Why is this... This looks like it should be right, but it doesn't look like it is.
[232:53.45]Oh, right there.
[233:05.88]Okay.
[233:12.79]Get out that way.
[233:13.49]Is there anything else here?
[233:16.82]It can stand upright there, but I don't think it does anything.
[233:21.20]This is just the beginning of GoldenEye, the facility level, which is the best level.
[233:25.60]Can I tell you guys something?
[233:27.69]When I used to play GoldenEye, I actually do not really know what the last six or seven GoldenEye levels look like.
[233:37.99]because when I was younger I would just go to the facility and that was one of the first games where you could kind of just do anything you could just do whatever you wanted there was a mission but you did it was you could just kind of go anywhere you really wanted to so what I would do I I I'm I'm actually something's wrong with me I'm realizing this right now so I would just go to the facility level and find interesting ways to shoot the guy that was in the bathroom stall
[234:08.49]There was a guy in the bathroom, and you... I wanted to try to just, okay, get him, and then hide and just watch everybody, like, watch the alarms goes off and stuff.
[234:17.60]Throw, like, a grenade down there and just, like, wait for the alarm to go off and then hang out and be like, I'm just in the vent, nobody knows!
[234:26.78]I... If I have... Let's say I probably realistically have two to three hundred hours in GoldenEye.
[234:34.82]At least one hundred of them were in the vent in the facility.
[234:40.89]It has to be.
[234:47.90]Seriously.
[234:48.32]It really... Where is it?
[234:50.66]There we go.
[234:55.46]Where are you?
[234:58.59]Is that Garfield?
[235:05.87]No.
[235:06.67]Oh, okay.
[235:09.50]Looks like somebody already did the thing that I was about to do.
[235:18.58]I'm not going to make that same reference.
[235:20.17]They all did it already.
[235:22.13]Computer!
[235:22.53]The data is uploading.
[235:26.41]Well, this confirms the point of Perseus was to train telepathic commanders to work with clone soldiers.
[235:34.09]Why would that kill you?
[235:38.97]Wouldn't you be cushioned by all the, like, people?
[235:42.57]This is not that far of a fall.
[235:55.28]And it's just dead.
[236:00.73]Okay.
[236:01.11]You had some other issues, I think, besides just falling down.
[236:07.82]Slide kick him in.
[236:08.68]Oh, okay.
[236:09.00]I can't think that's funny.
[236:10.02]I can't.
[236:10.26]Look at eyes sliding.
[236:11.28]Nope.
[236:11.42]Okay, we're good.
[236:11.94]Alright, thanks.
[236:12.68]Whatever I just did.
[236:13.66]Okay, let's go.
[236:43.69]Open fucking world, you wouldn't do it?
[236:45.45]You wouldn't, like, break this?
[236:47.23]It's a two window there.
[236:49.11]Open fucking world.
[237:13.21]Got it.
[237:31.08]Here we go.
[237:32.36]Time for video gaming.
[238:07.61]Here we go!
[238:50.54]Kind of messy, but you know, I'll take it.
[239:06.19]Where the fuck?
[239:09.25]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
[239:18.90]Sorry, that was fucking sloppy anyways.
[239:28.80]Here we go, one, two, three.
[240:06.65]Alright, we're good.
[240:07.49]One, two, three.
[240:19.74]This is a silent fucking gameplay.
[240:30.84]You're gonna try to move the thing that's see-through in the way so I don't shoot you.
[240:46.85]This is right in front of me, it's right in front of me, why did I do that?
[241:26.92]Can I pick it back up?
[241:39.81]Good.
[241:41.09]He was waiting for me.
[241:42.71]He wanted to shoot the barrel.
[241:44.70]That's great.
[241:45.40]I love it.
[241:46.32]He was like, I'm gonna shoot that barrel.
[241:47.84]I'm gonna shoot that barrel.
[241:50.12]What?
[241:57.71]There's no way you both- Why were they over there?
[242:12.76]Not- not this time.
[242:27.14]You idiot.
[242:40.85]Fire and rescue is giving up on Jankowski.
[242:42.77]What do you mean giving up?
[242:44.07]He's banging his head really hard and he's wandering around the harbor with amnesia.
[242:50.24]I'm not giving up on anybody.
[242:51.34]What are we talking about?
[243:09.74]It's when I activate it.
[243:11.80]How do they know if I stand still and I activate the slow-mo They don't how do they know if they just go?
[243:18.93]Oh, no, but what do I start shaking?
[243:21.07]Oh?
[243:42.33]I thought he was alive.
[243:43.01]Hold on, I'll see.
[243:44.93]Please.
[243:51.86]Oh my.
[244:00.34]He was trying to kick me.
[244:09.70]stream is not live what are you talking about no we had the same idea what the is that is he what
[244:49.12]What are you talking about?
[244:58.93]What do you guys mean?
[245:00.39]Look at the funny image.
[245:01.53]Hold on.
[245:06.05]What is it?
[245:12.23]Look at it.
[245:12.69]I'm looking.
[245:13.23]I'm looking.
[245:15.32]Oh, shit.
[245:17.52]Oh.
[245:19.21]It's a very flattering smile.
[245:21.13]Oh, my god.
[245:21.97]Is that real, though?
[245:33.78]That's real?
[245:35.61]Why do I look like that?
[245:50.24]I don't really look like that, though.
[246:01.41]You're getting old.
[246:03.37]Yeah, I know.
[246:04.89]I know.
[246:05.19]What?
[246:22.15]It's alive?
[246:30.78]Where is he?
[246:31.14]Okay, we're good.
[246:35.60]Save it.
[246:37.38]Bring this out.
[246:40.58]Smile and optimism.
[246:44.23]Wow.
[246:45.61]Holy...
[246:55.78]Okay.
[246:57.18]I'm going to go up 10.
[246:58.14]Full health.
[246:58.68]Super save.
[246:59.88]Oh, okay.
[247:00.24]Here we go.
[247:45.14]Nice Waluigi impression.
[247:48.75]A little too much grit, though.
[247:54.23]You gotta bring it down a little bit more.
[248:11.56]Whoa!
[248:21.43]That was a bad quicksave spot.
[248:24.33]It's okay.
[248:26.83]Where is it?
[248:49.00]Alright, I'm going in.
[248:49.74]Fuck it.
[248:50.06]Here we go.
[248:51.52]One, two, three, go!
[248:53.49]Ooh, I bounced him.
[248:58.93]Okay, so far so good.
[249:14.21]Flashlight!
[249:19.42]Screams.
[249:20.90]Um.
[249:21.40]Fuck.
[249:21.82]Wrong way.
[249:49.39]Never mind.
[249:49.79]I was gonna try something.
[249:53.17]Let me pick it up with F. We're on the roof.
[250:09.58]Good.
[250:10.66]How you holding up, Mr. Bishop?
[250:12.12]Looking forward to getting the hell out of here.
[250:14.49]That was like so... It had to have been fake, right?
[250:17.05]Had to have been.
[250:20.12]It had to have been.
[250:21.80]And I agree with you.
[250:22.76]It had to have been.
[250:33.92]Is it saved?
[250:34.42]Yeah.
[250:35.80]Get off there!
[250:43.05]Who's... Are you throwing a grenade?
[250:54.62]Why would you draw?
[250:57.76]Woah!
[250:59.96]I think I shot his gun and it fired and hit me in the face.
[251:11.17]Un-fucking-believable wrong button.
[251:18.72]Playing with fire, playing with fire!
[251:30.81]I'm trying to do fucking cool moves.
[251:32.70]Alright, I'm done.
[251:42.58]Holy fuck, that hurt.
[252:16.11]We good?
[252:19.86]I think so.
[252:24.28]Good.
[252:28.73]Somebody asked how long I plan on streaming tonight.
[252:30.91]So for the next week or so, I'm gonna do a thing where I only stream for short amounts of time.
[252:36.47]Is that guy on the other side of the building?
[252:43.58]What?
[252:44.90]Did I drop a grenade in the ground?
[252:59.22]It's not gonna be funny.
[253:05.97]Okay, he's gone.
[253:22.27]But anyways, I'm trying to spread out the streams this week to do more streams, but less time on the streams.
[253:32.61]If that makes any sense.
[253:33.79]It should.
[253:44.30]Like five hours?
[253:45.72]Yes, it really depends.
[253:48.06]Because for anyone that wasn't here an hour or two ago, or when I started talking about it in the first place, I'm on a couple of new medications for my stomach that... Hold on, this is important.
[254:04.63]Oh, what the fuck?! !
[254:30.17]uh I mean I could be without I could be just whatever I could just tell you it's not like it's I'm like embarrassed by it who cares uh hold on he hasn't he hasn't told us no I haven't I have not you're right I haven't what is it well I'll let you come to I'll let you deduce that for yourselves
[255:00.29]What would I be on?
[255:03.18]That would... Oh, hold on.
[255:04.24]No, no, no.
[255:05.38]I want... A sniper rifle is fun, though.
[255:09.70]I'm on a certain medication that requires me to do something a few times a day.
[255:16.80]And it's a strong medication that has a specific purpose.
[255:25.08]And it's just causing me, like, some stomach upset, discomfort, and... You know.
[255:31.26]I can't really be in the same place for more than, like, four or five hours, really.
[255:36.64]No, I'm not doing cocaine.
[255:45.64]But I'm on two new medications.
[255:47.52]That's one of them.
[255:48.54]And the other one is, um, kind of working together with it.
[255:51.48]Uh, so...
[255:54.96]There will be more streams, but not as long.
[255:58.66]This week.
[256:01.13]Cocaine is one of them.
[256:03.87]So you can't clip it.
[256:05.41]Whatever.
[256:05.71]Who cares?
[256:08.29]Where am I supposed to go?
[256:10.39]Rejoin the Holiday Bishop on the roof.
[256:12.15]Isn't that where we are?
[256:12.79]I'm on the roof.
[256:18.49]Let's go.
[256:21.99]The other roof.
[256:29.18]There is no other roof.
[256:30.22]There's only one roof.
[256:39.70]I mean, I guess I have to go through here?
[256:43.36]Did I just miss a door?
[256:45.74]I may have.
[256:47.74]Yeah, looks like I did.
[256:59.17]Okay, wait, no, I just wrapped around.
[257:03.73]Nope.
[257:03.83]Fuck.
[257:03.95]I didn't, okay, I killed it.
[257:04.89]I killed it.
[257:05.19]I'm sorry.
[257:05.45]He died instantly.
[257:06.99]I didn't, I really am so sorry.
[257:08.05]He's just trying to tell the news.
[257:30.81]Alright, we're good.
[257:33.48]I'm gonna pick up- I'm taking the sniper rifle.
[257:35.26]I feel like, why would they keep showing it to me?
[257:39.56]Hey, you're leaving without me.
[257:41.46]You're leaving without me!
[257:43.14]Say it!
[258:02.13]That's quick alright stick together What's going on this guy's body
[258:29.41]I mean, he was being a little strange.
[258:31.62]He was being a little strange.
[258:58.79]Alright!
[259:03.43]I thought it was him.
[259:04.91]I thought it was the guy flying off the cliff.
[259:08.44]They had the same kind of cadence and tone.
[259:11.32]Okay.
[259:12.64]Again.
[259:14.72]That's a lot of money, though.
[259:17.04]Hold on.
[259:29.99]Goodbye.
[259:31.14]Uh, somebody give a hundred dollars.
[259:32.94]10,000 bits, hold on.
[259:33.40]He's like flying in a circle.
[259:34.40]Ugh.
[259:59.24]I'm one of his colleagues.
[260:00.26]What the fuck are we doing?
[260:01.90]There it is.
[260:04.71]There's the shoulder guy.
[260:05.83]This game is really, really fun.
[260:17.86]This has been just very fun.
[260:31.14]He's over here!
[260:32.64]What the fuck?
[260:34.46]How?
[260:35.12]Did you kill me that quickly?
[260:37.34]PumpkinSmasher68 gave 10,000 bits.
[260:40.24]That's 100 bucks in bits.
[260:41.62]That's a shitload of money.
[260:42.58]Thank you, Pumpkin.
[260:43.90]They say, hey, Jim, been watching your channel for a while now.
[260:45.73]Hope this makes.
[260:49.23]It's a hundred dollars.
[260:50.75]That's a shitload of money.
[260:53.39]I mean, thank you.
[260:55.29]That was ATC security.
[260:58.83]Why are they not shooting me?
[260:59.71]He's over here!

[261:48.45]He's here!
[261:53.73]That's ridiculous.
[261:54.49]I could throw that shit over that roof.
[261:55.88]Let's get out of here!
[262:04.90]What's happening?
[262:14.27]Where's the other one?
[262:17.09]Where's the other one?
[262:21.23]Wasn't there two?
[262:22.23]Wasn't there a second person?
[263:00.10]I can't!
[263:01.74]Okay, I need to pay attention.
[263:03.10]It's too fun to just... Okay.
[263:19.50]That was ATC security.
[263:21.38]Are you sure?
[263:22.58]Oh yeah, I'm sure.
[263:24.29]Friendly fire?
[263:26.19]Didn't feel very friendly to me.
[263:27.69]I think that they were deliberately targeting missions.
[263:30.21]What the fuck is ATC doing?
[263:31.59]It's been impressive.
[263:33.33]They keep their mouths shut about something.
[264:04.17]No!
[264:04.69]Just do it!
[264:05.49]You don't have to get close!
[264:06.81]I'm getting too close!
[264:07.95]I don't know why I'm doing that!
[264:09.27]Why am I getting so close to everybody?
[264:11.71]I was doing fine!
[264:14.70]I wanted to get over there and I don't know what I was thinking.
[264:32.56]Okay, I'm done.
[264:33.60]I'm ready.
[264:34.48]What the fuck is ATC doing?
[264:36.12]Guess they didn't trust him to keep his mouth shut about that.
[265:59.39]Get out of here!
[266:01.20]I wanted to watch him go- Okay, that wasn't on fucking purpose.
[266:10.20]Fuck.
[266:10.74]Everyone's gonna think that I did that on fucking purpose.
[266:12.88]And I did, but I didn't.
[266:15.07]I did, but I didn't.
[266:16.33]You understand?
[266:16.69]I did, but I didn't.
[266:18.59]I wanted to do a final look down.
[266:20.09]I did, but I didn't.
[266:20.91]And that was not a- It was, but it wasn't.
[266:22.43]You understand?
[266:26.82]That was ATC security.
[266:28.94]Are you sure?
[266:30.44]Fuck, I swear I've not tried to do this this many times.
[266:33.46]What the fuck is ATC doing?
[266:34.62]Is it in trust and making his mouth turn about something?
[266:38.04]God, I hope you're wrong.
[266:57.08]Who the fuck are you?
[267:07.29]What?
[267:08.45]How close are you?
[267:11.81]What?
[267:12.33]No, I'm not.
[267:13.87]I'm trying to... Where is this person?
[267:22.28]Oh, right there.
[267:28.44]Are they dead?
[267:29.04]Oh fuck.
[267:29.34]I thought that was a face.
[267:39.11]You're not alive.
[267:59.03]Okay.
[268:01.21]These guys have... It's so dangerous.
[268:05.57]This shit is so powerful.
[268:08.29]I have no more healing.
[268:33.13]Good, that's what I want.
[268:41.56]Cover me!
[268:45.62]Ahhhh!
[268:52.52]He's over here!
[268:55.48]Ahhhh!
[268:55.68]Ahhhh!
[269:02.49]Close the fucking door!
[269:23.20]Alright, give me that.
[269:24.04]Give me that shit.
[269:39.17]How the hell do I get out?
[269:39.83]Uh-oh.
[269:46.10]I'm good.
[269:46.46]Okay, let's go.
[269:50.66]There's no Half-Life crouch jump?
[269:53.04]I know what the fuck is going on there.
[269:56.53]One health pack.
[269:58.43]This is around the corner here.
[269:59.53]Alright, I can go the other way.
[270:21.92]Good health.
[270:22.42]Nice.
[270:24.02]They do put it everywhere, though, so that's good.
[270:25.70]Okay.
[270:33.53]Now we're up here.
[270:36.45]Snipers.
[270:36.99]That's why, because they had sniper rifles.
[270:40.67]Damn.
[270:41.17]Okay.
[270:43.01]Well, I got ammo for it.
[270:45.19]Might as well use it.
[270:55.87]Watch out!
[270:56.67]Grenade!
[271:01.47]How would you see that?
[271:04.95]I don't think they got out.
[271:08.13]How would you know that was a grenade?
[271:10.42]You just- you wouldn't.
[271:22.75]Oh, music.
[271:23.45]What does that mean?
[271:29.64]Alright, refilling all the health.
[271:30.62]That's good.
[271:32.12]What?
[271:39.50]What the fuck just happened?
[271:42.07]It went like anti-gravity.
[271:44.21]What?
[271:44.51]What happened?
[272:06.82]Okay, I'm fine.
[272:08.16]Oh, what the?
[272:09.11]What the fuck?
[272:10.07]What the fuck?
[272:22.69]Find a way back up to the main building.
[272:24.35]Oh, you bastard.
[272:25.90]Really?
[272:26.18]You're gonna do this shit to me right now?
[272:49.91]uh okay I guess I'm going over oh oh alright I'll take it thank you now we're gonna go uh up there somehow or under wait there we go
[273:20.46]Alright, what's... What's going on here?
[273:23.16]There's like a giant animal in there.
[273:26.04]It's shotgun time, man.
[273:27.38]Screwing around here.
[273:30.18]What is that?
[273:31.08]I thought that was a... It's alright.
[273:43.29]I need to get that health back.
[273:46.21]Can I reach through the wall?
[273:47.55]Come on, let me exploit this.
[273:54.94]You can't get up there.
[274:07.47]What is going on right now?
[274:08.54]Why is the world shaking?
[274:28.81]I knew it was going to fall.
[274:30.90]I knew it.
[274:33.84]And there ain't any other way to go, so I have to go around.
[274:37.66]Can't make that jump.
[274:46.15]So that leaves over here.
[274:55.56]I guess we're going to try over here.
[274:56.60]No, this is where I came in.
[275:01.56]So if I go this way, that way is over here.
[275:08.27]No, can I get up that?
[275:12.66]Huh.
[275:39.62]Can I do anything with them?
[275:43.42]Just go forward?
[275:45.62]I... I guess, but... I can't really go over here.
[276:05.34]Why can't I go?
[276:09.31]Alright.
[276:11.05]I guess I'm going this way.
[276:12.09]What's that?
[276:32.05]Wait, what?
[276:34.57]Oh shit, okay.
[276:39.25]No, I can't go that way either.
[276:45.29]I'm all done.
[276:46.03]Let's try over here.
[276:54.39]He hates gaming.
[277:05.08]That may have just ended the stream.
[277:06.60]I'm not kidding.
[277:22.83]no he didn't poop I starting to get um a little queasy it has nothing to do with the game it has to do with what what's going on in my life right now so um yeah on the next stopping point I think I'll call it after indoor
[277:49.16]That'll be just exactly where I wanted to stop anyways.
[277:52.28]In about, like, five hours.
[278:06.77]Yeah, I just got a good checkpoint.
[278:09.30]I don't want to push it.
[278:12.40]Yeah, that's good.
[278:13.98]That'll be good.
[278:14.34]We'll keep going tomorrow.
[278:16.11]So, again, for the next, like, four or five days, we're going to do more days but shorter streams.
[278:24.12]Plus, I actually have to go take some of this medicine now.
[278:30.30]And it's not going to be fun.
[278:32.06]But, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[278:35.32]We'll call it there.
[278:35.96]Oh, okay.
[278:39.72]This is a lot of fun.
[278:42.99]This was a blast.
[278:45.22]This game's great.
[278:46.82]Anybody know how much is left?
[278:49.48]What time tomorrow?
[278:50.67]Regular time, around 1 or 2.
[278:55.11]It's been about 4 and a half hours.
[278:56.57]4 hours and 40 minutes.
[278:58.25]A couple hours.
[278:59.19]Okay.
[279:01.33]This is about 3 hours, 4 hours.
[279:03.01]4 to 6 hours.
[279:06.03]Alright, then that might be a perfect time tomorrow.
[279:10.50]There's a lot to play.
[279:11.44]We're just going to spread it out.
[279:14.15]So, thanks for coming.
[279:15.55]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[279:17.61]Let's get to the bits and everything.
[279:18.72]We're going to call it right there.
[279:20.08]I'll just manually save it just in case.
[279:23.02]And we'll see you tomorrow.
[279:27.69]Oh, look.
[279:28.13]Top subgifter.
[279:30.15]I wonder if they fixed this, because Streamlabs OBS had an update.
[279:34.87]Let's check and see if they did.
[279:57.48]Let me see tops up gifter.
[279:59.82]Come on Session they just had an update tell me they fixed it No
[280:14.54]Come on.
[280:16.74]It's not me.
[280:18.50]This is the session.
[280:19.52]I didn't do anything this session.
[280:22.16]That's a pain in the ass.
[280:28.52]Let's put on a follower train.
[280:36.89]Bye.
[280:39.13]See you in a while.
[280:40.83]Oh, fuck.
[280:42.49]I'm getting...
[280:44.31]A little drained.
[280:45.89]But I knew that was going to happen.
[280:46.77]It's alright.
[280:48.71]Anyhow, let's go back about four hours ago.
[280:59.58]It's rigged.
[281:01.52]Well, it's rigged to reset.
[281:06.28]But thank you Sturdy Bread for the $2.50.
[281:07.96]Hey, here's some bits.
[281:08.79]I don't know what to put in these messages.
[281:10.17]Thanks for being the best streamer around.
[281:12.93]Thanks a lot.
[281:15.34]Glad you have fun.
[281:19.36]Also, thank you YesIsOnline for the $2.50.
[281:21.50]They say, I wish I could fully watch the stream today, but my glasses got absolutely destroyed at the JPEG Mafia show last night, and I have to spend my entire day blind.
[281:37.34]Inside this LensCrafters.
[281:41.82]They say, good luck.
[281:44.59]Thank you.
[281:51.08]Thank you Jules for the $2.50.
[281:52.40]Um, not at all.
[281:53.32]We had a conversation like a week or two ago about ghosts and stuff and I don't really believe in the term ghost in a traditional sense.
[282:16.00]We talked about how your great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather is like watching down and walking around your house and eating food out of your fridge.
[282:24.16]I don't know.
[282:24.78]It was a whole ordeal.
[282:28.89]But I don't really believe in ghosts.
[282:32.41]In the like... I'm here because I have unfinished business with you!
[282:41.97]You screwed me out of the deal and they literally won't leave your house like Beetlejuice style.
[282:46.93]No, I don't think that's real.
[282:57.15]Say Beetlejuice three times.
[282:59.31]I will never do that.
[283:04.22]That's what a ghost would say.
[283:07.64]Look, but I can't prove that they don't exist either, right?
[283:11.91]I can't tell you.
[283:13.11]Guys, we see a certain spectrum of colors.
[283:18.42]Who knows?
[283:18.76]There might be a whole other spectrum of light that we can't see.
[283:22.40]That's not like infrared.
[283:23.50]It might be something completely different.
[283:24.94]There might be a whole world underneath our world.
[283:27.10]I don't know.
[283:27.52]You can't see it.
[283:28.10]I have no idea.
[283:38.12]Do I believe in aliens?
[283:40.98]Um...
[283:43.13]Yeah, probably.
[283:45.25]If there's 500 billion galaxies, one of them's gonna have a Starbucks.
[283:51.04]Somewhere.
[283:52.58]There'll be something.
[283:54.24]I mean, I don't think we'll ever, ever, ever, ever talk to them.
[283:59.82]We'll never see them, ever.
[284:11.57]I don't know.
[284:14.91]Do you understand how fucked up this whole world is?
[284:16.83]Like, the giraffe exists.
[284:20.21]Nobody can tell you anything.
[284:22.03]Nobody can explain shit.
[284:33.18]You have a series of tubes in your body that carry a substance around your whole body.
[284:43.94]To make sure you stay alive.
[284:46.18]Huh?
[284:53.96]Electricity is a thing!
[284:55.28]Like lightning strikes from the sky!
[284:59.14]We're just making our best guesses, guys.
[285:02.37]It don't matter who you are.
[285:06.81]Can you imagine trying to fucking explain what the hell that is?
[285:10.80]Boom!
[285:12.24]Lightning!
[285:12.66]I have no fucking idea what that was.
[285:17.02]I guess we'll try to think what it could- we'll figure it out, I guess.
[285:23.64]Science can prove how it works, but science can't prove, like, why it does- why?
[285:29.47]Why is it lightning?
[285:31.65]Why do we have veins?
[285:32.69]Like, why did this happen?
[285:34.65]What the fuck was this for?
[285:43.80]It's called electric.
[285:44.74]I know what electricity is.
[285:45.82]I'm just saying.
[285:47.62]What?
[285:47.98]What?
[285:48.70]What?
[285:50.78]You put gasoline in your car and you can drive down the road.
[285:54.02]Why?
[285:55.44]How did we get that far?
[285:56.22]You have a flat screen TV in your house.
[286:00.09]You're telling me two to three hundred years ago, people would like fucking ride around on horse and buggies?
[286:05.65]And you have an iPhone in your pocket now?
[286:14.11]Maybe I do believe in aliens.
[286:15.47]They fucking landed and they gave us all the goddamn technology!
[286:21.49]Imagine not knowing what thermodynamics works.
[286:24.82]Thermodynamics was a word that was made up to explain what thermodynamics is.
[286:34.60]It's all language.
[286:51.04]An eye-opening stream.
[287:00.85]Time isn't real.
[287:03.75]Yeah, because time is a concept that we created to try to explain why the sun goes up and down.
[287:10.36]200 IQ!
[287:17.49]I tell you, guys, sometimes it's too easy.
[287:29.62]Can I tell you, one of my favorite things is verbal shitposting at the beginning and the end of my streams.
[287:36.98]It's so fun.
[287:39.01]Now I get it.
[287:39.55]I know why you guys do it.
[287:44.65]That's one of my favorite things in the world.
[287:52.32]He understands.
[287:59.08]You're always doing that.
[288:01.20]I don't know.
[288:01.56]It's fun.
[288:02.22]It's fun just to talk about random things.
[288:07.81]Dad gets me.
[288:13.65]Mouth diarrhea.
[288:14.83]Yeah.
[288:21.97]Who's your favorite?
[288:23.89]What's your favorite pantheon?
[288:37.30]Norse.
[288:37.76]Norse.
[288:38.24]Greek.
[288:39.52]Greek.
[288:39.82]Roman.
[288:48.63]Are we going to get a smite stream?
[288:51.39]No.
[288:54.44]I'm dumb and don't know what you mean.
[288:56.06]Uh, gods, gods.
[288:56.94]Yeah, you do.
[289:00.46]They're all cool.
[289:02.50]That's how people used to explain the world.
[289:06.70]Can you imagine if in a thousand years they're looking back at us talking about, like, string theory and they're, like, laughing because it's as ridiculous as Zeus?
[289:15.92]I don't know.
[289:24.69]They didn't know.
[289:32.55]It's funny now.
[289:33.88]Alright, hold on.
[289:36.68]I don't want to turn an end-of-the-stream shitpost into a let's-debate-science-for-real.
[289:45.72]Anyways, I don't even know how we got there.
[289:47.18]Somebody said something.
[289:51.52]But, anyways, let's go.
[289:56.51]Let's do it for real.
[289:58.01]Lizard Amiibo, thanks for the 500 bits.
[290:00.15]Hey, Jerma, I just started my first year of college, and so far it's been pretty rough.
[290:04.22]But your streams and videos are one of the things that have been able to make me smile.
[290:08.02]The time, effort, and... Why is this cut off?
[290:15.22]Streamlabs.
[290:16.76]I'm telling you.
[290:18.57]You made this new update.
[290:22.18]but um you're cutting off everything now why are you cutting everything off this is this is this new mini feed and not good I'm not happy with this huh mini feed cuts off everything how do I just make it a regular feed what have you done hold on
[290:54.27]I think I think I think I'm gonna dump stream labs OBS Yeah, not not doing it for me Not doing it for me at all actually Here good
[291:19.57]It's a bunch of great, interesting ideas that all of them just kind of don't work at the same time together.
[291:28.39]I'm just going to go back to the regular Streamlabs.
[291:30.94]Not Streamlabs, regular OBS.
[291:32.20]Apparently it's some really cool features that they added.
[291:40.00]Come on, man.
[291:47.42]OBS vanilla flavor, yes.
[291:54.52]Logitech bought Streamlabs?
[292:00.08]That's kind of interesting, I guess, yeah.
[292:04.11]That's kind of interesting.
[292:09.61]That explains a lot, does it?
[292:13.08]They're just trying to load too much in the same place, and then... I don't know.
[292:17.30]I could talk about how I don't like it, but it's fine.
[292:20.47]Just don't use it.
[292:21.77]It's that simple.
[292:22.93]Anyways, alright.
[292:24.01]Let's go back to what we were doing.
[292:26.13]We had... We had five community subs from Snooze and Copter at the very beginning of the stream.
[292:36.10]We also had... Cyclops Parker gave ten community subs.
[292:44.07]three four hours ago here thanks to the 10 community subs also zake this is where we left off here zake thanks for the 250 hey man thanks for providing a nice distraction from student stress how are you are you enjoying streaming cheers from 5 390 miles away I love streaming streaming is like one of my favorite things ever I would say it's streaming is
[293:15.16]It's one of my main focuses of my whole life, so.
[293:23.05]Greetings from 5,400 miles away.
[293:25.45]That's really far.
[293:26.33]I wonder... Where is that?
[293:31.08]I missed $200.
[293:32.88]Right now?
[293:33.24]Oh, earlier.
[293:34.92]Okay, yeah.
[293:36.02]It was from Vilemi.
[293:38.44]$200.
[293:38.46]20,000 bits from about five minutes ago or so.
[293:45.09]We were talking about, like, the blood vessels in your body and how that means that, like, aliens landed.
[293:50.85]I don't know.
[293:51.99]A bunch of people left and probably thought I was, like, actually a fucking weirdo.
[293:56.22]Oh, whatever.
[293:57.52]It's okay.
[293:58.62]Thanks for the 200 bucks, though.
[293:59.72]That's a lot of money, Vilemi.
[294:00.94]It's a shitload of money.
[294:04.14]At the same time, just to dump 220,000 bits.
[294:09.62]True.
[294:14.82]But, Vilemi, fuck yeah.
[294:16.02]That's a lot of money.
[294:17.06]And they say Jerm A-W-O-O.
[294:21.98]Jerm-O-Wu.
[294:24.16]I'm reading it.
[294:30.19]Tell us when the next carnival is going to be.
[294:31.57]It's not going to be a carnival, but it'll be a stream on the 31st.
[294:34.51]Or at least on the 30th or 31st.
[294:37.19]Doing a Halloween stream that's going to have a lot of intricate details to it, so... Go check out the Discord.
[294:41.75]There's a couple channels there.
[294:42.67]Go read the pinned messages and you'll know what's going to happen.
[294:48.40]But thanks a lot for letting me.
[294:51.12]That brings us back down.
[294:52.10]Let's go back down to... Where are we?
[294:57.71]Right down here.
[295:03.11]But, Lizard Amiibo, thank you.
[295:05.53]Sorry to hear that your first year of college is rough.
[295:08.27]It can happen like that, though.
[295:11.95]The first year or so is very nerve-wracking for everybody.
[295:15.97]So, you kind of just need to keep going, try to make some friends, and try to make the best of your college experience.
[295:26.54]It can be a lot of fun.
[295:29.35]Just make sure you're taking care of your work, taking care of your life.
[295:32.87]It can be a good time.
[295:35.48]But the first year always is a big kind of shock for a lot of people.
[295:43.57]But you'll shake off the cobwebs.
[295:47.65]I wish you the best of luck.
[295:50.25]Thank you, Snooze, for the 250.
[295:51.01]Hey, Jerma, I just want to say that your streams have always cheered me up and made me laugh.
[295:54.44]You're genuinely kind and humble.
[295:56.48]It inspires me to be the same way.
[295:58.84]Anyways, enough being cheesy.
[296:00.32]I made some fan art for you recently.
[296:01.88]I can't wait for the next community content night so you can see it.
[296:05.55]Good night.
[296:07.63]Yeah.
[296:09.17]Toss it in there.
[296:11.23]The next time we do it, I'm sure it'll be there.
[296:16.09]I appreciate the incredibly kind messages, though.
[296:18.88]Thank you, Snooze.
[296:25.24]And speaking of Community Content Night, I'm gonna be adding much more material to pull from for you guys that make videos.
[296:35.26]I will say it again.
[296:35.92]I've said it the last few streams in a row.
[296:38.42]I'm going back in front of the green screen for a whole stream.
[296:42.05]We're going to do a whole another thing where we pull a ton of suggestions.
[296:46.41]And we do green screen DLC for free.
[296:49.93]That's the title of the stream.
[296:51.23]I've got it already like a month and a half in advance.
[296:53.80]I already know that's what the title is.
[297:00.77]Hey, Lewd Sheep, thanks for the 300 bits.
[297:02.55]Hey, Jeremy, we just want to say hello from all of us at the Spreo Discord channel.
[297:07.21]Hello from there.
[297:08.59]Nice to see you.
[297:10.67]They say, oh, and PostPass says hey as well.
[297:15.75]PostPass1.
[297:17.43]Hi, guys.
[297:22.47]Thank you, Lewd Sheep.
[297:24.11]And hello, everybody at that Discord.
[297:25.99]Whoever you are.
[297:26.73]Wherever you are.
[297:29.37]Thank you.
[297:31.61]Sir Canine, thanks for the 250.
[297:32.85]Louis Anderson, human Garfield is probably one of the most terrifying creations in human history.
[297:39.25]What happened to that guy?
[297:40.15]That guy just kind of disappeared.
[297:44.03]I wanted more of the grenade eater.
[297:46.47]But we're not going to get it.
[297:51.69]Hey Shiggy, thanks for the 250.
[297:53.07]Hey Jerm, I wonder if you consider yourself a... I don't know, what is this?
[298:02.27]What's this word?
[298:05.43]What do you have to say about the fans proclaiming you are a model?
[298:09.54]H?
[298:09.76]What is this?
[298:17.67]Yeah, what is that?
[298:18.71]What does it mean?
[298:33.03]It means stupid but handsome.
[298:37.45]Well, those people are the ones that stuck around for the post stream.
[298:41.20]There are tubes in your body.
[298:42.70]Rant.
[298:43.86]And then they left.
[298:45.14]And that's the only piece of the content they watched.
[298:46.84]They missed the part when I talked about the... Yeah, well, whatever.
[299:00.66]a himbo I don't I okay I don't what do I have to say about that I got a degree I went to engineering school I was a waiter for three years
[299:30.39]What are the more made-up things around the wiki page, I wonder?
[299:41.12]Why don't you look at chat during the stream?
[299:44.23]I look at chat so much during the stream that it makes me step in bear traps.
[299:47.37]500 times.
[299:59.82]I'm just speaking reality.
[300:05.70]That's a nice excuse.
[300:07.02]It is a pretty good excuse.
[300:09.17]I mean, it's surely absolutely an excuse, but it's a pretty good one.
[300:15.15]Hey, Warm Like Biscuits, thanks for the 500 bits.
[300:17.07]Hey, Jerma, I've been watching you since your early YouTube days.
[300:21.13]Thank you for all the laughs.
[300:22.01]You've pulled me out of some dark places.
[300:23.96]Here's a little bit of gratitude, so thank you.
[300:27.36]Thank you, Warm Like Biscuits.
[300:34.34]I'm glad you can laugh.
[300:38.88]I love laughing.
[300:39.68]It's one of my favorite things in the world.
[300:40.96]And guess what?
[300:43.70]Laughing at shit has pulled me out of some places that I never really wanted to be in over the course of my life.
[300:54.03]I think it's so important.
[300:55.53]I think laughing and having a good time, jokes, I think comedy is one of the most important things.
[301:03.83]If you can pull comedy out of any situation or situations, and everybody can laugh, I think it's incredibly important.
[301:11.73]It's the best medicine.
[301:18.84]Well, it's a good supplement.
[301:21.44]It's a good supplement to medicine.
[301:24.76]I'd probably say that's more accurate.
[301:32.71]We're talking comedy here.
[301:36.44]Yeah, I think it's a very important thing, so... If anybody gets that out of this stream, then that makes me really happy, because that's... Obviously, I find that to be something that I care so much about in my life.
[301:48.01]So I'm glad it translates to a lot of you.
[301:51.09]That makes me really happy.
[301:53.25]Thanks a lot.
[301:58.70]Hey Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.
[302:01.40]Question about the slime night.
[302:03.12]Okay.
[302:04.18]That's gonna be the 31st, right?
[302:06.16]Also, how are you handling the slime?
[302:07.76]Because I'd expect it's gonna create a mess on your gear and your headphones.
[302:11.00]Are you saran wrapping your home room?
[302:13.59]Doing it in a studio, I cannot imagine how awful getting the slime out of the equipment be.
[302:18.01]You'll see.
[302:19.85]Uh, it's... It's not going to be in my room.
[302:24.69]So, don't worry.
[302:26.45]That's not gonna happen.
[302:30.56]There is a whole... The last week and a half or so since I first started talking about it has been complete and total planning.
[302:39.97]Every day that I'm not on stream, essentially.
[302:42.97]And it's almost ready to go completely.
[302:45.61]So, don't worry.
[302:47.56]That is completely and totally taken care of.
[302:49.22]He's gonna do it on his bed.
[302:53.18]No, that's not where this is gonna be.
[302:56.25]But yes, it's supposed to be on Halloween.
[302:59.83]Halloween day.
[303:02.63]I know a lot of people have things to do on Halloween night, usually.
[303:06.56]So it's going to be Halloween afternoon into Halloween evening.
[303:16.58]Should be fun.
[303:17.82]And it's not just going to be a slime stream.
[303:20.03]Let me make that really clear.
[303:21.09]There's at least two or three segments on that stream that are not sliming.
[303:26.25]There are other things that could be Halloween related.
[303:30.03]Slime is just the main event.
[303:33.17]You know how we do it.
[303:36.33]MindMyHalo, thanks for the $10,000 bits.
[303:40.41]There's no message, but just thank you for the $10 drop.
[303:48.68]Thank you shitty viewbot for the 500 bits.
[303:50.72]Last time you mentioned Scream Fortress, you said ask me again.
[303:53.88]Well, I'm asking you again.
[303:54.86]Is there any chance for a TF2 Scream Fortress stream?
[303:57.81]No.
[304:00.41]I... I will probably not stream Team Fortress 2 ever again.
[304:08.21]I don't think so.
[304:12.63]Like I said before, there would need to be a significant major change to the game for me to get interested in it again.
[304:21.10]Because let's be completely and totally honest here.
[304:24.22]Scream Fortress is just... It's the Halloween update.
[304:28.84]It's not like a major change to the game.
[304:31.94]It's a few cool maps and some cosmetics and stuff.
[304:35.08]It's not... It's not anything that's like a big, big, big major change.
[304:42.99]And even when sometimes they've done updates that have brought a couple of new items and a couple of new scenarios, it kind of wasn't enough.
[304:52.79]You have to remember, I put almost six, seven straight years into that game.
[305:01.02]And I sort of closed the book on it.
[305:04.56]There are other things that I'd like to do that are not that important.
[305:14.04]He hates it.
[305:17.80]No, but it's kind of... It's one of those scenarios where I like to look back at how awesome that community was and how amazing those five plus straight years of my life were.
[305:30.17]I put a lot... I was playing TF2 before Steam even counted the hours.
[305:35.75]And that's when I spent the most time in it.
[305:41.12]But I don't think there would be a scenario where it'd be like, hey, here's like a TF2 live stream.
[305:45.97]I don't really have any... That's not like doing it for me.
[305:51.75]Like it could have maybe used to years ago.
[306:06.01]You want to see TF2 get the love it deserves from Valve?
[306:10.87]Yeah, but that would mean Valve would... Valve has not been very game-centric over the last five years.
[306:18.47]They've been more hardware and business-centric.
[306:22.09]And it's done really well for them.
[306:25.21]Everybody wants Valve to make games, but Valve has done... They're just incredibly lucrative when they focused on Steam and the VR stuff.
[306:37.58]If they ever actually...
[306:40.21]And they're supposed to be.
[306:41.11]They're supposed to be developing something for VR.
[306:43.91]That's what everyone says, right?
[306:52.00]Half-Life 3 VR.
[306:53.28]I know that's the thing that everyone says now.
[306:56.00]And even if it's not, they're doing something.
[307:00.63]But it would take something significant.
[307:02.13]Valve would have to really decide that something like Team Fortress was...
[307:08.28]Alright, we're gonna go back to TF2, and we're gonna develop like six new official maps.
[307:13.37]We're gonna make a new game mode, and it's gonna be 12 new items, and we're gonna rebalance a bunch more stuff.
[307:20.54]But it's hard for that to even happen.
[307:23.35]Because at what point is it... They've added so much stuff to TF2.
[307:28.65]They've added so many items and weapons and game modes and maps.
[307:35.92]At what point do they not have very much else to do?
[307:45.27]They've added a whole new class worth of items dozens of times.
[307:56.84]So it's almost like I know everyone's like, oh man, I wish Valve would make like 25 new weapons and items.
[308:03.43]But they've already come up with so many, and in the grand scheme of what that game is...
[308:09.99]It's not that you're limited, it's that they've done probably so much stuff that they can't really probably come up with.
[308:17.49]What the hell are we gonna give like the fucking spy?
[308:21.61]He's got like 12, 15 different knives and guns and... Give him a fire knife.
[308:36.39]A knife gun.
[308:38.45]Yeah.
[308:40.91]And that's the thing, though.
[308:41.65]When they come up with this many things, they come up with so many items and weapons.
[308:44.77]He's got, like, a bunch of revolvers, and people only use one or two of them.
[308:55.17]I think the era of TF2s... And here's the thing about TF2.
[308:59.69]TF2...
[309:03.14]Everybody wants to emulate how fun that game is, and how awesome it was, and how everybody cared about it.
[309:10.72]You see so many games pop up now that are just desperately trying to tap that fun, interesting, funny community game.
[309:20.23]And it's almost impossible.
[309:30.85]There was a string of at least a few years in a row back in like 2013, 14, 15 into like 2016.
[309:36.70]Where everyone wanted to be, everyone wanted to make that next awesome Team Fortress style game that everyone cared about.
[309:45.00]But...
[309:45.46]Yeah, somebody just said it's a timeless masterpiece.
[309:48.71]It is.
[309:50.33]So that's why it's hard to do another one.
[309:52.71]And I think that's why they're afraid to do another one.
[309:54.25]Maybe not afraid, it's the wrong word.
[309:56.69]But when you make something that's so good, that from its... When it was from release to all through all these updates, it is an actual first-person shooter solidified in history as one of the best that has been ever made.
[310:12.72]so you have to make another one and you have to make it as good or better than that one it's a lot of pressure and a lot of work to try to stand on your own shoulders but we'll see what they do and people will if Team Fortress 3 gets announced
[310:38.62]Can you imagine how everybody will, everyone will be so excited for it?
[310:43.54]Oh, this is going to be the best game ever made.
[310:45.50]It's a new engine.
[310:46.53]They're doing Source 3.
[310:47.77]It's going to launch Source 3.
[310:49.55]They've got like two new classes and look at all these new maps and there's like a whole MVM new single player.
[310:55.37]It's going to be so good.
[310:56.79]If that game is not the best game you've ever played,
[311:01.97]If it has to hit that expectation.
[311:04.93]Otherwise, it's just, ah, fuck.
[311:06.63]It wasn't really that good.
[311:08.55]I wish they didn't do it in the first place.
[311:11.22]Then you think, look at Diablo 3.
[311:14.32]Do you know how long I wanted Diablo 3 for?
[311:18.00]Diablo 3... Diablo II is one of my favorite games ever made.
[311:21.35]It's one of my favorite fucking games.
[311:22.89]I love it so much.
[311:25.62]And every day I prayed for a Diablo 3.
[311:29.02]I thought about all the new items they would be making.
[311:31.38]A new engine.
[311:33.38]Oh, it would be so great.
[311:34.32]There'd be endless content.
[311:36.16]There'd be so much awesome shit you could do.
[311:38.08]Just give us Diablo 3, please.
[311:40.88]And it's almost like the monkey's paw, right?
[311:44.05]Like, you got it.
[311:47.11]And it really wasn't what I wanted.
[311:51.39]It was, Diablo 3 was fun, but it was not the thing that I wanted.
[312:02.05]At what cost, yeah.
[312:04.02]They made it, they tried to do the whole money auction house thing, and you could look over that for a little while, but items didn't drop.
[312:11.10]The problem with Diablo 3, the very beginning, when the game, the game was like a month old.
[312:15.44]The unique, the legendaries, the unique items, that's what we call them.
[312:20.31]Those, they didn't drop, and they were just random stats and shit.
[312:23.77]It was just dog shit.
[312:25.19]It was dog shit.
[312:29.99]Reaper of Souls came out, and they actually did a lot of good.
[312:33.88]They fixed a lot of stuff.
[312:36.54]What's the lead dev of Reaper of Souls?
[312:41.02]He tried to do his best.
[312:44.07]And I don't think that guy works for the company anymore.
[312:46.63]He, like, fixed Reaper.
[312:47.99]He fixed Diablo 3.
[312:50.51]And I think they got rid of him.
[312:54.35]Did that happen?
[312:54.91]Am I remembering this correctly?
[313:00.89]Yeah, he left.
[313:03.47]Yes.
[313:08.85]What?
[313:10.81]Why wouldn't you make sure that that person...
[313:15.17]Was responsible for your next Diablo iteration.
[313:19.56]That's... It's like almost... Yeah.
[313:26.50]His name is Josh Martins.
[313:31.48]This dude... And obviously some of the other talented people that worked with him and underneath him, right?
[313:37.08]But this dude and all these other... They took that game and they made it actually like fun.
[313:45.88]Alright.
[313:46.64]Well, you want to do Diablo 4?
[313:48.54]It'd be great if you did it, because from the ground up you probably would have some better ideas.
[313:59.62]Like, what the fuck happened?
[314:01.60]Like, what?
[314:06.13]If they, okay, if Blizzard announces, forget about like all the other, uh, controversy that Blizzard is seeing right now.
[314:12.63]If Diablo 4 is announced, I don't, what the fuck is this game even going to be?
[314:16.58]Who even made this game?
[314:26.44]Josh Mascara, not Martin's.
[314:28.60]Okay.
[314:28.80]Yeah.
[314:28.94]I want to make sure I get that right.
[314:35.02]Josh Moschera and Kevin Martins were the directors of Reaper of Souls.
[314:39.90]And after everybody said, all the critics, all the fans were like, wow, um, I mean, Diablo 3 still isn't that good.
[314:47.83]It's still like not what I wanted, but this is actually really good.
[314:52.04]They like took what, they took all the broken systems and they made them all work and then they made the game fun.
[315:03.50]You don't have those people stick around.
[315:10.97]It's like, it's just counterproductive.
[315:13.05]I bought D3 on release and regret it deeply.
[315:26.81]All my friends' accounts got stolen within the first... Oh, jeez.
[315:29.61]That's not good.
[315:36.75]Diablo.
[315:38.19]Me click on enemy, push number keys once every hour.
[315:44.26]Right, but you're referencing Diablo 3.
[315:48.92]Diablo II was a dangerous fucking game.
[315:51.52]Okay, look, let me be... If you played Diablo II and you did the exploity kind of ways to just mow through everything, when you get to Nightmare in Hell in Diablo II, it was a dangerous game.
[316:09.85]You were at risk of dying in every room in Diablo II.
[316:15.04]Especially when you got past, like, level 20.
[316:20.26]Diablo 3 was just a nut... It was an idle game.
[316:26.99]At its very, very core.
[316:28.35]Once it got to complete late game, it was an idle game.
[316:33.12]And you just waited until this thing dropped letters on the ground that you walked over and did you get?
[316:41.46]Just open it and what is it?
[316:43.08]Okay, no, it's not better than what I have.
[316:44.49]We're going to just watch the numbers again.
[316:53.51]The ever-changing difficulty slider in D3 was a bad idea.
[316:56.60]Bad design.
[317:00.98]Maybe, but I think there's probably ways to do that.
[317:06.97]There's ways to do, like, a never-ending difficulty slider without it being... Well, I mean, never-ending's the wrong word.
[317:14.91]There really should only be, like, five difficulties.
[317:19.97]The regular game... Because there was, like, even... You would put that slider on hard or very hard, and it was just the normal game.
[317:30.34]The issue with Diablo III in the end was the normal game was absolutely just brainless.
[317:39.88]You couldn't even lose.
[317:42.31]You could just walk into rooms and things.
[317:44.17]It wasn't even hard.
[317:45.05]The game was not even... It was so easy.
[317:49.15]So on its lowest kind of end, like the first three difficulties were just, why would you even do them?
[317:53.63]They're just too easy.
[317:55.11]And the last three difficulties were not even possible.
[318:01.01]The scale was just off.
[318:04.23]Have a normal base game that's challenging and fun.
[318:07.19]Have a difficulty after that that's harder.
[318:10.19]Have a difficulty after that that's really fucking hard.
[318:13.62]Like a normal nightmare hell.
[318:15.78]You want to have Inferno?
[318:18.14]Sure, have Inferno.
[318:19.74]Have Inferno be stupid and impossible.
[318:23.76]But that's like the plus.
[318:25.23]That's like the game plus mode.
[318:28.55]You don't have to do that.
[318:32.98]There were like 12 difficulties in Diablo 3.
[318:44.01]There's a lot.
[318:47.49]15.
[318:47.81]That's even more than I thought.
[318:53.41]They're in 19 now.
[318:56.73]Why even have difficulties then?
[318:59.30]Why not just have prestiging?
[319:01.89]You don't even... What's the point of having difficulties?
[319:03.57]Why don't you just prestige, give up all your shit, and then start at level 1?
[319:07.83]And the game's harder.
[319:09.24]What's the point of having a slider?
[319:20.28]And if you don't want to prestige, you just don't... Just uncheck a box.
[319:25.93]That's what Seasons is.
[319:27.69]Yeah, but Seasons doesn't change the difficulty.
[319:29.73]Seasons is just the...
[319:32.32]That's not a difficulty thing, right?
[319:35.26]Should you play Diablo II?
[319:36.86]It really depends.
[319:39.86]Because Diablo II is old.
[319:43.24]And a lot of people can't get over that old-school video game feel.
[319:48.93]There's a lot of things in Diablo II that are stupid.
[319:52.17]That really suck.
[319:53.69]That you have to get over.
[319:57.52]It's just an old, old game that never got the remaster treatment, never got the remake treatment.
[320:04.64]It's just an old-ass game that's really, really good.
[320:09.04]Stupid equals bad, or greater than bad.
[320:12.22]Yeah.
[320:20.63]You gonna play the weird Minecraft Diablo clone?
[320:23.33]Um, I don't know.
[320:24.77]It depends on if it's any good.
[320:28.23]But we went from Scream Fortress to talk about, I don't know, Diablo somehow.
[320:33.45]But yeah, the whole Diablo thing really, it's... That's close to my chest, because that... It's literally one of my favorite things ever.
[320:44.65]And that's why stuff like Diablo Immortal, Diablo 4... I'm not going to get excited for those games.
[320:53.23]I don't have a reason to.
[320:56.83]Because everybody that ever was really involved in any of the original stuff just isn't there anymore.
[321:02.41]It's like they have all these assets randomly that have been canned over the years.
[321:07.73]Who knows?
[321:08.27]Like, the Diablo 4 might have Titan assets.
[321:13.88]Remember that?
[321:14.54]A lot of that turned into Overwatch?
[321:16.26]Who knows?
[321:26.26]There's not a good demand for those games anymore.
[321:28.20]And that's another thing, too.
[321:30.68]Yeah, people just top-down ARPGs.
[321:35.15]At least in the realm of Diablo and loot collecting and stuff.
[321:38.11]People would rather... Loot collection is still very much alive.
[321:41.93]But people would rather get their loot from first-person shooters or out of a box.
[321:50.55]That Diablo formula was transformed into a box you pay $2 for.
[322:09.73]Path of Exile, you hit enemies with a rubber sword.
[322:11.89]Yeah, Path of Exile is awesome.
[322:14.79]I just don't like the camera.
[322:17.83]It's kind of hard for me to get over.
[322:31.31]Uncensored-ager.
[322:32.43]What's that?
[322:32.99]What?
[322:36.83]That's an interesting problem.
[322:37.63]What's the problem with the camera?
[322:39.75]It's... I think it's too close.
[322:45.69]I wish I could pull the camera out like 20% more in Path of Exile.
[322:52.07]And I wish it was angled a little bit more like a few... like 5 degrees, 10 degrees more than it is right now.
[323:09.43]But that's the only reason why.
[323:11.13]And that's a very, very, very just personal thing as to why I can't play it.
[323:19.64]There are actually some... I think you can get mods for it, or you can get like window changers for it, but it's really not the same.
[323:27.74]If you run Path of Exile in a window and you resize the window in really strange ways, you can kind of get more viewing angle, but it's not ideal.
[323:48.17]And I know that that problem, that's not a problem that anybody really...
[323:54.14]That's not an issue to patch the game over when a handful of people just don't really like the camera.
[324:02.39]Right?
[324:03.17]There are millions of people that have played Path of Exile and loved every second of it that don't care.
[324:07.81]That doesn't bother them at all.
[324:09.93]So I do not... I never expected, nor do I ever expect them to be like, Oh, one guy said he didn't like the camera, so let's spend a bunch of development time making it so you can pull the camera out by 20%.
[324:23.30]No, like I completely understand, but yeah, we can move on.
[324:35.57]Good conversation.
[324:36.43]It's all, all interesting stuff.
[324:44.98]ac DC freak thanks for the thousand bits I would rather spend money on you than my tinder profile you funny funny man oh shit oh oh shit I forgot about how funny that is oh this game is I love this game
[325:13.67]How have I not played F.E.A.R.
[325:15.39]before?
[325:16.11]Ever.
[325:16.29]And it's Monolith.
[325:19.56]Like, I... Monolith is so good.
[325:21.76]I love Monolith.
[325:22.90]They make such great games.
[325:25.03]How have I never played their original FPS franchise?
[325:37.32]I'm gonna be in bed.
[325:39.68]Kim's gonna think I'm insane.
[325:41.22]I'm gonna be in bed, lying there, just on my iPad, just hanging out after eating some dinner.
[325:47.05]And I'm just gonna think of, oh, shit.
[325:50.33]And it's gonna make me laugh.
[325:51.57]And there's gonna be no context.
[325:58.64]But thank you, ACDC Freak.
[326:00.42]Thank you for giving me $10 instead of Tinder.
[326:05.36]I guess.
[326:06.18]Thank you.
[326:09.88]Also, thank you to Freudian Weapon for the 250.
[326:11.54]Happy Wednesday.
[326:12.12]Hope you feel better.
[326:14.42]Try not to overdo it.
[326:15.72]On another note, do you plan on dressing up for Halloween this year?
[326:19.29]I plan on being in some sort of costume on stream.
[326:22.59]We'll see what it is.
[326:23.87]I've not figured it out yet.
[326:29.54]yeah I I am I'm not overdoing it I mean this stream is only about I mean we've spent a little bit more extra time here because we're getting into some conversations but I stopped at about five hours four hours and like 45 minutes that's probably what it'll be like tomorrow somewhere around like four four four and a half five
[326:48.95]I'm trying just to be easy, but in the long term, it won't be less time on stream.
[326:55.77]It'll just be spread over more days.
[326:58.43]So that'll be, should be fine.
[327:03.39]But thank you.
[327:03.81]I appreciate the concern.
[327:06.25]Siroc, thanks for the $2.50.
[327:07.63]They say B-E-E-T-L-E-J-U-I-S-E-C-E.
[327:14.72]I can't say that a third time, or I will get sucked into hell.
[327:19.51]Thank you.
[327:21.73]Thank you, The Thrill, for the 500 bits.
[327:23.61]I remember playing this game years ago, and my god, the sounds and ragdoll physics are still insanely funny.
[327:28.88]The game and series really does hold up well today, which is pretty cool.
[327:32.19]Hope your poops aren't spooky.
[327:37.34]Yeah, it does.
[327:39.47]I'm surprised this game is this old.
[327:40.95]When games are this old, they are not that good.
[327:45.41]They might be funny, but they're not fun to play.
[327:48.37]This game is actually fun to play, too.
[327:55.95]The rest of the franchise is really not that good.
[327:58.01]Yeah, maybe I'll do them eventually.
[328:00.64]I know that I just wanted to do this one because I just heard so many good things about it and I never put any time into it.
[328:08.05]But here we are now.
[328:11.73]Uh, Freudian, thanks for the 250.
[328:13.13]My last bit message got messed up.
[328:14.56]Tried to put a jermaHeart emote.
[328:16.42]So have another.
[328:18.42]Thank you.
[328:21.48]Uh, Jason, thanks for the 250.
[328:23.16]What was your most embarrassing moment on stream?
[328:26.45]Uh, pick one of these two.
[328:27.75]Either slapping myself in the face or crying to a farting and screaming compilation.
[328:36.41]Both pretty embarrassing.
[328:38.30]I'm not sure which one is worse.
[328:44.78]One of those.
[328:45.16]Uh, thank you Zeon, W-A-S-D, for the 500 bits.
[328:54.49]Bro, we're the literal teeny parts of the universe who invented the idea of things meaning things.
[329:00.85]So things just mean whatever we say they do.
[329:04.17]We're the arbiters.
[329:06.27]Also, I'm sorry for saying fuck you that one time.
[329:08.48]Also, Resident Evil 2 Claire campaign, fuck you.
[329:17.68]That's what I'm saying.
[329:18.52]Yeah, that's what I said.
[329:19.58]I said, like, we have made up that idea of giving things meaning by things that we say.
[329:29.27]But, hey, I appreciate the fuck you.
[329:30.55]Thank you.
[329:35.15]Gonderlane, thanks for the 250.
[329:36.21]Since it's been a while since you did some DOS, the archive just added over 2,500 new DOS games.
[329:43.76]I did see that.
[329:44.70]That seems insane.
[329:45.94]I know you stopped the streams because you were digging too deep into the vault and the games were getting worse, but the new games should add new stuff or a new stream.
[329:54.61]Also, a good idea would be a horror DOS game stream if you want.
[329:57.67]Love you, Jerma.
[329:59.91]More DOS games playable.
[330:01.03]Yeah, we'll go back to it.
[330:03.75]We'll check them out, see if there's any better ones, any new good ones.
[330:12.70]That's the thing when you have a list of, like, 5,000 games that are on a page.
[330:18.98]You just go, how are we going to do this?
[330:22.70]How are we going to do this reliably?
[330:27.52]But those streams, some of the most fun I've had on stream this last year has been on some of those DOS streams.
[330:33.45]So I definitely would like to do it again.
[330:35.41]But I want it to be the whole stream.
[330:38.08]Because it seems like it's kind of in one of those scenarios where it's, oh, we're going to do this, and that's going to be like four or five hours.
[330:44.26]And I guess we'll do DOS, too.
[330:45.37]But you have to focus a full day on that.
[330:50.29]You need to give some of those games the hour or two plus that they deserve.
[330:54.97]At least some of them.
[330:57.09]So, yeah, I agree.
[330:57.85]We should go back and do it.
[331:01.90]Thank you, Jason, for the 250.
[331:05.02]Please watch this.
[331:05.82]I'm crying my ass off.
[331:08.94]Crying your ass off.
[331:11.70]And what is this?
[331:12.52]This is a Twitter account?
[331:17.74]Ow, fuck.
[331:22.40]Hold on.
[331:28.16]This is a Jerm out of context.
[331:33.62]Yeah, I've been like this stuff before.
[331:45.48]These... This... This page gets like a lot of views.
[331:52.32]Like 10,000 views on that video on this Twitter.
[331:55.04]5,000.
[331:56.18]Like 71,000.
[331:56.88]Holy shit.
[331:57.36]50,000 views on this video?
[332:19.91]What the fuck is this?
[332:23.95]What the fuck is this video?
[332:32.08]Something in the water.
[332:33.76]I'm telling you.
[332:42.88]It's just this.
[332:44.20]They linked this.
[332:52.74]Love him or hate him, Jerma's spitting straight facts.
[332:55.96]Sounds like a bored toddler.
[333:00.03]Show it.
[333:00.47]There's nothing to show, just a bunch of noises.
[333:29.29]Alright, this is... I'm gonna keep going.
[333:37.93]I gotta get some food and then take my fucking... my gross drink that I have to drink.
[333:47.03]But thank you, Jason.
[333:47.85]That's the Jerma OOC Twitter.
[333:55.43]Thank you.
[333:55.80]Anything else show official for the 1500 bits?
[334:01.88]$15.
[334:03.28]Thank you.
[334:05.10]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[334:09.69]Loved watching the carnival stream.
[334:11.31]Also wondered what kind of retro or obscure computers you are a fan of.
[334:15.68]Keep up the cool projects and streams as always.
[334:17.76]Thank you.
[334:20.19]What kind of retro or obscure computers are you a fan of?
[334:22.97]I am actually a big fan of those old chunky iMacs.
[334:30.68]You remember those things that were in the computer lab?
[334:33.42]They were different colors.
[334:34.26]It was red, blue, green, orange.
[334:44.20]They were junk, but I loved them.
[334:48.10]were cool yeah it was just this little shell that had everything right there it was a little computer and it's weird this isn't this is insane I remember what that room smells like I remember what that computer smells like that room had that imac smell there was an imac room smell it was it was the computer smell the computer lab smell
[335:19.01]So every time I think of an iMac, I smell the computer lab.
[335:31.47]I can never explain what that smell is.
[335:33.73]I just know that it exists.
[335:40.32]It was great.
[335:43.94]But let's get the credits on.
[335:47.80]Throw them up there.
[335:52.19]Uh, if I can get this to do the thing I would like it to do... Why did you get rid of this?
[336:02.42]Streamlabs OBS.
[336:04.08]Why did you do this?
[336:06.86]How do I... I gotta go to my settings and get this shit out of here.
[336:12.41]What the fuck is all this?
[336:16.71]I just wanna go... I just wanna... Hmm...
[336:29.18]How do I run?
[336:34.94]Yeah, we're switching back.
[336:38.78]Banana cream pie.
[336:40.20]Yep.
[336:40.78]That's good stuff.
[336:42.48]Good, good stuff.
[336:46.68]Am I just starting or am I just ending?
[336:48.62]I'm about to end the stream.
[336:50.60]We'll be back tomorrow, though, at the same time.
[336:53.45]Alright, let's roll.
[336:53.93]I'm going to get on.
[336:56.81]Thank you, everybody.
[336:58.25]Thanks for supporting the stream, continuing to sub new subs, old subs.
[337:02.95]You surprise me every day.
[337:04.38]Thank you.
[337:08.64]We have a few more to get through in the bits category here.
[337:13.69]Uh, Modus Pones says, There better be Bugleberry on Halloween.
[337:17.47]Don't give in to the haters.
[337:19.45]Thanks for the $2.50.
[337:21.51]What makes you think I'm going to give in to people that hate that character?
[337:24.71]Don't you think that's more of a reason why they would show up?
[337:33.86]I'm just saying, if they were to... I'm not going to say anything.
[337:38.92]I don't know what his schedule is like.
[337:41.76]He's all over the place.
[337:54.01]Thank you, Zeon WASD, for the 500 bits.
[337:57.35]I'm actually sorry for saying fuck you, though.
[337:58.91]I don't know how to express love, dog.
[338:01.37]Real question.
[338:02.87]Are you ever going to do stand-up comedy on stage and in person?
[338:05.51]You're more funny while improvising than most Netflix comedians are with their super well-prepared specials.
[338:11.04]And your premeditated skits are even funnier.
[338:13.94]Also, any plans on voice acting in anything?
[338:15.56]You got some chords.
[338:20.10]Uh, no.
[338:22.10]I don't think I'll ever do it.
[338:24.77]Unless it was for a specific stream where the point was I was going to try to do open mic night.
[338:32.57]I thought about that before.
[338:34.71]Where I try to come up with some material to do a seven minute set in open mic night.
[338:43.10]But that's the thing.
[338:43.96]Every time I've come into this, oh, should I do that?
[338:46.68]That'd be fun.
[338:47.52]That might be funny.
[338:49.38]I always hit the same wall.
[338:51.73]That's a 10 minute stream.
[338:55.14]That's not... That's... That's it.
[338:57.82]There's nothing else there.
[339:05.18]I mean, maybe if I want to do it one day and just turn it on and just... Who cares?
[339:08.58]I'm going to do like a 14-minute stream.
[339:14.30]We'll see.
[339:14.90]But I don't have really any plans for it.
[339:16.74]There are plans for other streams coming up over the next few months.
[339:20.45]But that is not currently one of them.
[339:26.47]But thank you so much.
[339:27.57]I like what's going on here.
[339:31.37]You know, this is where my focus is completely.
[339:37.03]So I don't think I could... I couldn't spread myself out if I really wanted to pursue a stand-up comedy career.
[339:43.24]That's time.
[339:43.92]That's a lot of dedication.
[339:44.88]It's a lot of work.
[339:46.98]I wouldn't want to split myself up.
[339:52.00]It takes a lot to do that.
[339:55.98]Hey, Plasma Player, thanks for the $2.50.
[339:57.49]Thanks for playing Fear, Jerma.
[339:58.69]My big brother bought this game.
[340:00.93]And I was too young and a wuss to play single player, so I played only multiplayer so I wouldn't get scared.
[340:07.13]Yeah, it's great.
[340:08.07]I love it.
[340:13.75]That's so cute.
[340:18.07]Thank you, though.
[340:18.51]Thanks for the $2.50.
[340:20.68]Lizard and Meatball, thanks for the 500 bits.
[340:22.84]It's me again.
[340:23.41]I have some more bits.
[340:24.63]Just wanted to make sure you know how much we appreciate the creativity and effort you put into your streams.
[340:29.11]Because you really don't see that every day.
[340:31.63]Anyway, I hope things get better with your illness soon.
[340:33.55]Have a great night.
[340:34.29]Yeah, we're just trying to figure out what's going on.
[340:37.59]The doctor right now is just kind of throwing darts.
[340:39.90]And we're going to see if any of them land.
[340:43.16]So, good to go.
[340:47.37]But, yeah.
[340:48.51]I can reiterate one more time.
[340:49.73]I say a lot, but... I have to stay interested or else I can't do this.
[340:59.46]If I am not interested, if I'm not having a good time, and I'm not focused and care about each stream, I can't stream.
[341:14.51]So...
[341:16.32]He hates streaming.
[341:22.26]End of career.
[341:26.08]No, that's just the way it is.
[341:27.68]I can't change that.
[341:32.19]So, as long as I stay interested, then I'm still interested and I want to keep doing stuff and keep doing, keep streaming, keep having fun.
[341:38.99]That's going to keep happening.
[341:46.26]But thank you.
[341:48.02]What's your retirement plan?
[341:50.10]We're going to do a retirement party on this stream.
[341:54.48]I don't know.
[341:55.32]Whenever that happens.
[341:56.62]Could be 10 years in the future.
[342:00.99]Could be 7 years, 6 years.
[342:02.59]I don't know.
[342:03.87]I'm going to be 40 in 6 to 7 years, guys.
[342:09.79]I don't know what's going to happen.
[342:11.53]It's not gonna be tomorrow.
[342:13.53]No, this is not like an immediate, like within the next few years thing, guys.
[342:22.66]Maybe like when I'm 40, I'll just, I'll transition to like eating sunflower seeds and like talking about baseball for my streams.
[342:32.03]I don't know.
[342:33.25]I have no idea what's gonna happen.
[342:34.35]I don't know what's gonna happen in a year.
[342:35.99]I have no idea.
[342:42.53]Just be a dad streamer.
[342:43.58]Yeah, and we'll just talk about school and stuff.
[342:54.68]I have no plan.
[342:57.80]And having no real plan is what keeps me able to care about what's happening now.
[343:07.00]I don't have a 10-year plan for this stream.
[343:09.58]I don't have a 5-year plan for this stream.
[343:11.78]I have a, what do I want to do this month?
[343:16.98]What do I want to do this year?
[343:19.78]What kind of streams do I want to make?
[343:22.91]Do I want to do a couple of large-scale things?
[343:25.69]Maybe not.
[343:26.69]Yeah, I do.
[343:33.77]I don't have a plan.
[343:36.26]But it's a controlled, I don't have a plan.
[343:41.44]It's not like I just, whatever, who gives a shit?
[343:44.92]I don't fucking know or do, I have no idea.
[343:48.16]My everyday life is chaos.
[343:50.72]No.
[343:55.41]But I need to stay open to everything.
[343:58.35]That's kind of how I've always lived.
[344:03.65]Am I, you're gonna stay in Vegas?
[344:05.05]Yes.
[344:06.82]That's at least the immediate plan.
[344:10.03]Is to stay here.
[344:15.53]Stay in Las Vegas.
[344:19.13]And I don't know.
[344:21.14]As I get older, there are a few things that may or may not happen in my life.
[344:28.36]That I have to start to think about.
[344:29.68]There's a lot of things to think about as you get a little older.
[344:51.86]No, but you understand... I... I... We have a lot of fun on this stream.
[344:58.84]And we talk a lot of random shit, we fuck around a lot, we have a lot of fun.
[345:03.67]But... You know, I do have this... I am getting a little older.
[345:09.38]And you need to think about what you do when you get a little older.
[345:13.98]I don't know.
[345:14.44]I have no idea.
[345:16.08]No more poo-poo jokes.
[345:20.12]That's right.
[345:20.56]Well, actually... I'm just looking at my total unfollowed for the hour.
[345:36.23]A big spike here.
[345:40.24]About 70, 70, 80 people.
[345:43.18]It was two over the whole two days here.
[345:47.44]I didn't know that was that important to you guys.
[345:51.64]No, you know what I mean though.
[345:53.26]I'll be 35 next year.
[345:55.86]Kind of going to start to think about what I, you know, where, who, what do I want to be?
[345:59.61]Who do I want, what do I want to do with my actual, like, adult, no longer 18 to 34 on the drop-down box?
[346:07.41]What do, you know, what do I want for my future?
[346:08.71]You have to think about it.
[346:17.92]president.
[346:18.38]I feel like once you hit 40, it's a whole new life.
[346:26.92]I just want to be prepared for it.
[346:30.18]Time's flying.
[346:31.00]I know.
[346:31.94]That's why I want to be ready.
[346:34.65]There are decisions to make.
[346:35.77]There are choices to make.
[346:36.69]I want to make sure that I make the right ones as I continue to age.
[346:44.93]You grow your second stomach at 40.
[346:50.27]But Admiral Breadball, thanks to the five community subs.
[346:53.67]And then finally, Dr. Clay at the end.
[346:56.47]For 250, just a random question.
[346:57.79]Do you plan on checking out Meat Fortress?
[347:01.22]I don't have any plans to do VR.
[347:04.94]Until... After the Halloween stream.
[347:12.48]Halloween stream will happen.
[347:13.74]And then we'll go back to kind of a normal stream stuff.
[347:20.39]We've done a lot of horror games and creepy, scary stuff this month.
[347:24.27]And I've never done that before, by the way.
[347:28.36]This is the first time that I've spent significant time back to back to back to back doing scary horror games for October.
[347:41.55]Normal streams like playing with children's toys drunk.
[347:44.93]Yeah.
[347:54.97]But not until I do VR again.
[347:57.99]And when I do VR again, there'll be another long list of new stuff that's come out that I could play like we did last time.
[348:06.31]But I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[348:08.61]We're gonna finish Fear tomorrow.
[348:12.57]Again, these streams over the next week are gonna be shorter while I am on this stint of medicine that I'm trying to get used to.
[348:21.80]I'll see you guys soon.
[348:23.98]Tomorrow, same time, somewhere around like between 1 and 2, like it always is.
[348:28.30]We'll finish Fear.
[348:30.83]Have a great night.
[348:32.37]Take care of yourselves.
[348:34.47]Maybe we'll see you tomorrow.
[348:36.57]Good night, guys.
[348:40.44]See you later.
[348:54.01]Thank you.
[349:28.89]Thank you.
[350:03.77]you
