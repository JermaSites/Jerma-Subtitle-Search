[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.44]Okay.
[00:05.96]I'm a tub shitter.
[00:08.78]I get back to it and I look at the chat and I say that I'm a tub shitter.
[00:12.26]Well, okay.
[00:13.51]I don't shit in the tub.
[00:15.83]That's not true.
[00:17.87]So we're going to transition to Vin Diesel's Wheelman.
[00:23.11]Vin Diesel's Wheelman is the next game we're going to play.
[00:38.72]We're gonna play Wheelman.
[00:43.58]And I fucked up the way that this is spelled.
[00:45.64]How do you spell Vin Diesel?
[00:56.72]I definitely didn't spell it right.
[00:58.22]Not even close.
[01:00.26]What is it?
[01:04.31]It's not right.
[01:05.85]I don't even care.
[01:07.51]Who cares?
[01:11.91]Let's go ahead and prop this open.
[01:16.76]Vin Diesel.
[01:22.60]The Chronicles of Riddick.
[01:24.00]Actually, I was going to get that game.
[01:27.48]But we're going to play Wheelman.
[01:29.80]For like another hour or two.
[01:34.26]But I don't want to rush.
[01:35.55]Here's the thing.
[01:35.97]Remember when we played SEGA CD?
[01:38.33]Man, this is not a good argument to make, but...
[01:40.96]When we played all those, I bought like 20 SEGA CD games and they all were like just shit.
[01:47.27]They all were like shit and tubs and stuff.
[01:49.93]And some of those games I only played for like nine minutes.
[01:56.28]So I would like to give each one of the, like the Saboteur was also, there was obviously like two or three hours of like good fun there.
[02:04.02]Probably more than that, which is why I'm not against going back and playing that game again.
[02:14.61]Damn tub shitter games But yeah, it's I want to give each one of these games like an hour or two Not because I think they're any good But because it's it's worth a shot to try to play some of them And obviously some like some of them are good Demon's Souls is good like condemned to is good.
[02:40.62]I
[02:43.55]Like, the voice.
[02:45.91]The voice I want you, with the microphone included in the box, is good.
[02:50.17]We have to get these games at least an hour.
[02:56.80]Two games per stream is a good pace?
[02:58.42]I think so, too.
[03:05.02]Play the voice in due time.
[03:07.34]In due time, my friends.
[03:11.06]But for now, we're gonna play Wheelman.
[03:15.62]In due time.
[03:21.04]I'll give you another one.
[03:22.43]Just some random one.
[03:25.43]No, that is too, too important of a surprise.
[03:29.27]This game, this series of two games, mandatory game install is required.
[03:33.27]What?
[03:33.85]Okay, how big is this game?
[03:39.29]Alright, well, let's go to IRL for fucking five minutes.
[03:47.11]Alright, we got a minute.
[03:48.95]How's the hair?
[03:49.35]Can I fly up?
[03:50.85]I hope so.
[03:54.09]Actually, I don't want you to, like, that's the stack over there.
[03:56.67]There's, like, a stack of, like, fucking five feet tall.
[03:58.71]Look at that.
[03:59.01]That stack is fucking five feet tall.
[04:00.59]You know what I mean?
[04:03.74]Like, from here to here, it's five feet.
[04:08.32]That's huge.
[04:09.68]That's a big stack of games.
[04:11.30]And yes, I am drinking out of a fucking strange jug.
[04:14.04]Come on.
[04:18.58]Yes, I'm holding a strange jug and I'm drinking out of it.
[04:23.14]That stack is taller than me?
[04:26.48]Oh yeah?
[04:26.78]Let's find out.
[04:31.14]Derm is fucking tiny.
[04:34.74]Let's see how fucking big this is.
[04:41.11]Got ya!
[04:44.55]Why am I drinking?
[04:45.83]Because I fucking feel like it.
[04:49.14]I did this joke, I did that joke like fucking two, I did that joke like two years ago.
[04:57.19]No, that wasn't, that was, that was my pants.
[04:58.81]That was my pants bunching up.
[05:00.05]Have you ever seen fucking Curb Your Enthusiasm episode one?
[05:03.29]Get a fucking, get a, get a grip.
[05:12.98]Curb Your Enthusiasm episode one.
[05:16.06]They should title that fucking episode, Get a Grip.
[05:28.83]Oh, Jesus.
[05:29.27]Muse, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[05:31.57]You should take a page out of Bruce Green's notebook and snap every finished PS3 disc in half.
[05:42.62]No.
[05:42.86]I'm not going to snap my game.
[05:45.21]Only one game needed to get... Army of Two needed to get snapped.
[05:51.47]Yes, this is alcohol.
[05:52.41]It is.
[05:53.23]It's hard cider.
[05:54.05]It's homemade hard cider.
[05:55.33]I didn't make it.
[05:56.70]Somebody else did.
[05:58.55]And it's very good.
[06:00.17]It's from a local farm.
[06:01.45]Well, not really local.
[06:03.27]It's quite a ways away, but still very good.
[06:07.03]This guy makes it by himself.
[06:08.73]And it's like farm dungeon.
[06:12.25]What would you call that?
[06:14.13]What's it called when you have a basement that you make alcohol in?
[06:19.20]An alcohol dungeon?
[06:21.32]A cider dungeon?
[06:23.08]What's it called?
[06:26.72]It's a bathtub.
[06:31.68]A brewery.
[06:32.38]No, it's a fucking alcohol dungeon.
[06:34.16]It's a farm dungeon.
[06:40.72]We got a little... We got quite a ways to go.
[06:45.94]This game better be worth it.
[06:50.42]God, do you remember how long it took to do this shit back in the fucking day?
[06:54.03]Installing a game from the disc?
[06:56.77]Yikes.
[06:59.97]It's called a felony.
[07:02.65]Sync up my audio and video.
[07:04.42]I can't because my microphone has to be just barely under one second delayed so it can match up to the PlayStation 3 being captured from a capture card because the video game is delayed by a second coming into the computer so I have to delay my voice.
[07:21.59]You're gonna have to deal with it.
[07:24.19]Because I've dealt with it, as I have.
[07:30.87]Have ever had dick on cider?
[07:37.37]I can delay the video to match.
[07:38.69]I don't care, Etalyx!
[07:42.15]Go get- go bring your fucking stream knowledge somewhere else!
[07:47.06]How do I do that, by the way?
[07:50.60]How do I do that in- how do I do that in OBS Premium?
[07:53.58]What is this called?
[07:56.33]OBS Premium?
[07:58.21]What program am I using?
[08:00.11]OBS Premium, right?
[08:03.89]OBS complete?
[08:05.87]OBS complete.
[08:14.53]Please don't make us watch you playing in one hour of another shit game.
[08:20.25]The Saboteur was a good game.
[08:23.95]The Saboteur was a good game.
[08:27.55]Guys, listen to me.
[08:28.61]This is very important.
[08:29.41]This is really important to understand.
[08:31.82]Just because a game isn't new doesn't mean it's bad, right?
[08:36.13]Like, sometimes I get some shit for this.
[08:38.85]Like, Jeremiah, how come you never play, like, new games?
[08:41.35]Like... Go ahead.
[08:46.59]Like what?
[08:47.94]What new game do you want me to play?
[08:49.66]You want me to get into the fucking Call of Duty World War 2 beta and be a fuckface and stream that shitty game for fucking four hours?
[08:55.12]No!
[08:55.58]Why would I do that?
[08:56.24]That game's not gonna be fun.
[08:57.34]It's gonna be a piece of crap.
[08:58.62]Like all the- Remember Ghosts?
[09:00.20]That was a fucking great game, wasn't it?
[09:02.06]Advanced Warfare 2 was fucking fun for four hours, wasn't it, guys?
[09:05.88]What do you want me to play?
[09:07.21]What, like, new game do you want me to play?
[09:11.91]You want me to play fucking COD?
[09:16.65]You want me to get, like, in the Destiny 2 beta and hold right trigger down for nine hours?
[09:20.59]Like, what the fuck do you want me to do?
[09:26.47]Play Lawbreakers?
[09:29.70]I don't want to play Lawbreakers.
[09:32.50]I want to play Cuphead, Shadow of War, and Absolver.
[09:38.10]That's the new games that I'm going to play.
[09:42.57]Go eat cod on stream.
[09:50.31]Breath of the Wild.
[09:51.07]I don't have a Switch.
[09:53.67]Do you see all these fucking games?
[09:55.07]Do you see this shit?
[09:58.51]Do you see this?
[10:00.26]You see what's in here, right?
[10:02.92]You want me to play Call of Duty World War II?
[10:06.30]We went back and made another World War II Call of Duty game because we're out of ideas.
[10:10.74]We have nothing else to say.
[10:12.57]We did like fucking robot exoskeleton suits.
[10:16.41]Now we're going to go back to World War II.
[10:19.31]We're gonna play the fucking voice, not Call of Duty World War II.
[10:28.72]Come on.
[10:30.94]Play the one that you're holding right now.
[10:32.92]Look, we're already fucking halfway through installing Vin Diesel's Wheelman.
[10:40.06]Sonic Mania is apparently pretty good, but that's not even new.
[10:42.73]That's like a new... That's a fucking new take on an old game that came out like fucking 30 years ago.
[10:50.78]Here's a classic for you.
[10:52.16]Starhawk.
[10:53.54]Starhawk.
[10:54.04]It's in the seal.
[10:55.00]This shit is sealed up in the fucking seal.
[10:57.50]This is a classic.
[10:58.48]This game is fucking very good.
[11:01.50]You want me to play Star Wars Battlefront?
[11:12.07]What about this one?
[11:13.11]Huh?
[11:16.01]What about this game?
[11:19.81]Backbreaker!
[11:20.33]This is a football game.
[11:21.63]That's not... Alright, hold on.
[11:23.13]There's a reason for this.
[11:24.23]There's a reason for this.
[11:28.50]This is a game where you fall on top of each other.
[11:31.60]This is not a football game.
[11:33.82]Don't be deceived.
[11:35.64]You literally fucking fall on top of each other.
[11:38.62]It's the game... Listen, don't say it's trash.
[11:40.32]Somebody said trash.
[11:41.22]Listen to me.
[11:42.46]This is made by natural motion.
[11:44.40]Do you know who natural motion is?
[11:47.31]Can you see it?
[11:47.93]Natural motion games.
[11:49.57]They're the guys that made all the physics-based fall, like, get hit by cars engine.
[11:55.52]This game's not good.
[11:57.36]It's a football game where you fucking run into each other, and it's funny, and it's goofy.
[12:03.14]We'll play that one for eight minutes, don't worry.
[12:05.48]What else we got?
[12:07.46]Excuse me.
[12:08.64]Uh, excuse me.
[12:11.13]Excuse me!
[12:12.13]TV Superstars!
[12:17.42]You get to be in the game.
[12:19.52]As a TV star.
[12:20.62]You put your face in it.
[12:25.82]Hold on a minute.
[12:28.43]Oh.
[12:29.33]Should I bring back sorcery?
[12:31.53]Oh, Gerbo, we want to see sorcery again.
[12:33.25]We're so desperate for sorcery.
[12:34.79]There it is.
[12:36.69]Sorcery.
[12:37.25]The PlayStation Move one.
[12:38.79]This game's very good.
[12:41.05]Very fucking good.
[12:46.71]Lair.
[12:51.24]Except Lair sucks.
[12:53.86]Lair sucks.
[12:54.72]I mean, I know that.
[12:57.26]What else we got?
[12:58.36]Got a lot of shit to do.
[12:59.26]There's a lot of games to play.
[13:03.74]I ain't gonna play fucking Call of Duty 9.
[13:05.32]You know what happens when you play Call of Duty?
[13:10.05]Look, everybody that plays... Just let me drink out of my weird bottle and be a weirdo.
[13:19.32]Why are we doing the shitty ones first?
[13:20.49]We didn't do the shi- Tokyo Jungle is the first one we played.
[13:23.83]Tokyo Jungle was first.
[13:26.21]And that game is awesome.
[13:27.71]That is a cult classic video game that people love.
[13:30.85]Tokyo Jungle.
[13:32.51]What was next after that?
[13:34.89]The next one after that was not shitty.
[13:36.19]It was actually very good.
[13:38.63]Was it?
[13:42.93]Hipster streamer is different for the sake of being-
[13:49.59]How dare you say that to me.
[13:54.28]Tokyo Jungle is amazing.
[13:55.64]It's great.
[13:56.04]And I'm underdressed.
[13:57.62]I know.
[14:00.26]It was Bear Grylls.
[14:01.08]Alright, that was bad.
[14:02.06]But whatever.
[14:06.64]COD World War 2 is actually COD 12, not COD 9.
[14:09.46]Well... I've got a lot of interesting things to play over here.
[14:20.30]I think you're over-addressed.
[14:24.98]Is it one of the Ender's HD remake?
[14:26.53]Angry streamer gets mad when his bad games are insulted.
[14:28.85]But, like, this is history.
[14:31.99]This is history.
[14:34.89]Let's take a look at what's in... No, no, no.
[14:36.53]I don't want to do that.
[14:39.29]What is this one?
[14:44.05]Alright.
[14:44.57]There's an explanation for this one.
[14:52.68]I know this game is, like, just not gonna be fun.
[14:56.23]I bought it for no reason.
[14:57.15]I bought it because, like, you know when you're on Amazon and you're just, like, going through and finding things to do and, like, finding things that you, like, want to play?
[15:07.24]This just got caught in the crossfires and I don't know why.
[15:10.58]I bought it and it's here.
[15:14.87]Never dead?
[15:15.35]This is a game where like you dismember your head and throw it at people and shit.
[15:19.49]It's like a Suda51 game.
[15:20.85]I might be making that up, but who knows?
[15:24.05]Look, I'm not gonna blow my fucking- I'm not gonna show you all my cards.
[15:26.73]I'm not gonna show you my whole hand.
[15:27.79]There's plenty of things that you can't see.
[15:29.89]There's a couple down here too that you don't know.
[15:34.66]Haze has jetpacks.
[15:38.68]Hey, back when there wasn't shit on PS3, it was all shit.
[15:41.08]PS3 was fucking great.
[15:43.08]Just because things are old doesn't mean they're bad.
[15:46.16]Like, what's going on with this current generation of video gamers?
[15:50.12]If it's not PUBG, League of Legends, or, like, Counter-Strike, we might as well throw them in the fucking trash.
[15:55.75]Let's throw them in the trash.
[15:56.87]Huh?
[15:57.19]Where's the trash can?
[15:58.13]Let's throw them in the trash.
[16:01.01]This is history.
[16:02.37]Preserve it.
[16:18.36]me play PUBG honk honk 59% I know this is like what the fuck is this like 30 gigs how big is this game where did you find a redneck bottle this is just this is what it comes in don't worry you're fine I have one classic game somebody said
[16:48.00]Demon's Souls, Condemned 2, The Bourne Conspiracy, Starhawk.
[17:05.99]I only have a couple classic games.
[17:11.87]Like John Woo presents Stranglehold.
[17:15.80]That's not a classic game.
[17:17.86]That's not a game that you're looking forward to seeing.
[17:21.90]Okay.
[17:26.13]Okay.
[17:33.79]My mistake.
[17:43.72]Redneck streamer grows rat tail and drinks from jug.
[17:50.86]Why is this taking so long?
[17:53.15]This game's gonna send me such a piece of crap.
[17:56.57]Stranglehold is awesome.
[17:58.85]And we need to preserve them.
[18:00.47]We need to show them and talk about them and play them.
[18:04.35]It's not all about getting lethal in Hearthstone.
[18:09.36]Whoops-a-daisy.
[18:11.84]Whoops-a-daisy.
[18:15.01]Come on, easy, easy, Butterfingers.
[18:17.25]Come on.
[18:19.51]Did we really though?
[18:20.55]Mr. Lethal.
[18:26.74]No, I didn't spill.
[18:27.32]I got my cell phone in my hand.
[18:35.06]Give us a house tour.
[18:35.98]There's no, it's on a wire, dude.
[18:38.22]Like what am I gonna do?
[18:38.86]Bring it like, turn it over so you can see the window.
[18:42.93]Yeah, no, Hearthstone's not on PS3.
[18:44.51]It's not a classic.
[18:46.55]And even if they're not classics... Some of these are real bad, but it's okay.
[18:54.04]Um... Demon's Souls for real, though.
[18:57.02]Like, not even joking around.
[18:59.24]I want to play Demon's Souls, and I want to try to get at least past, like, the first boss.
[19:04.51]Or at least, maybe.
[19:06.73]Show the window.
[19:09.55]Okay.
[19:09.75]Fine.
[19:10.49]There you go.
[19:14.84]It's the window.
[19:25.77]Nice.
[19:40.32]Okay.
[19:40.80]Well, that happened.
[19:43.77]Hey, look where we're at.

[19:49.70]Oh, that's fucking- that's hilarious.
[19:52.24]There's a street sign over in the woods.
[19:57.36]That's woods.
[19:59.50]That's the woods.
[20:01.88]And yes, yes, I didn't paint the trim.
[20:05.40]I didn't paint the trim.
[20:06.76]I didn't.
[20:09.37]Didn't paint that trim.
[20:10.39]It's wood.
[20:11.17]I know.
[20:15.11]Fucking judge me all you want.
[20:18.83]Trans gonna translocate you from your window.
[20:23.68]Fucking... Some of you guys are probably capable of doing that.
[20:30.54]That's the woods.
[20:34.08]Knock knock pizza.
[20:36.92]God.
[20:40.09]I do stream in a remote location.
[20:43.71]Fucking...

[20:50.22]77%.
[20:50.46]What am I drinking?
[20:52.40]I'm drinking homemade hard cider.
[20:58.56]From a local farm.
[21:00.78]And by local, I mean like an hour away.
[21:05.44]What if somebody knocked on my window right now?
[21:07.92]I would throw all- and- and yeah, oh, hey, what happens if somebody knocks on your window right now?
[21:13.80]Oh, Jeremy, why did you buy all those classic video games that are going to protect my life?
[21:18.24]Because, like, guy opens up the window, window opens, excuse me, and I'm just like, bang, you got haze in your face.
[21:26.12]What's that?
[21:26.38]You got fucking ne-

[21:29.61]You got an Everton in your face.
[21:31.19]What's that?
[21:31.97]Oh, the voice?
[21:32.57]This fucking box... This box... This box is four pounds!
[21:39.02]Bang!
[21:39.40]Right in the teeth.
[21:53.76]Look, I'm just bored.
[21:54.50]I'm sorry.
[21:55.27]I'm just, like, fucking bored right now.
[22:06.33]Actually, I don't have Puppeteer.
[22:09.15]I was actually looking at Puppeteer and I didn't buy it.
[22:12.07]It seemed like a puzzle game.
[22:12.98]Is it like a fun puzzle game or is it like... How does it work?
[22:20.76]Actually, he did kind of get me.
[22:22.38]The tip of that just got me, Odell.
[22:25.40]Right there.
[22:27.04]That hurt.
[22:33.67]Corvid, thank you for the $10.00.
[22:36.64]They say, Gerber, you're one of the funniest and most entertaining people on the internet.
[22:40.48]Thank you for years of entertainment.
[22:41.68]Great moves.
[22:42.50]Keep it up.
[22:42.96]Proud of you.
[22:45.34]Well, thank you, Corvid.
[22:47.10]I appreciate that.
[22:48.88]I just like hanging out and talking to you guys.
[22:51.40]It's fun.
[22:53.26]It's fun to hang out and just talk and just chill and read what you guys have to say.
[22:57.47]It is.
[22:59.25]Thank you for the $10.
[23:01.31]Fucking install for this game.
[23:03.63]The saboteur was like four seconds, by the way.
[23:08.38]Reaper, 500.
[23:09.10]Thanks for the $5.
[23:09.90]Nice window.
[23:10.64]The Jerma lore has been expanded.
[23:15.10]Thank you for the $5.
[23:16.53]Reaper.
[23:20.65]All of the is.
[23:21.95]Thanks for the bits.
[23:23.99]Fix the goddamn audio sync.
[23:25.99]I can't.
[23:28.31]Look, just imagine.
[23:29.15]Just pretend I'm lagging on my webcam.
[23:32.78]I don't do webcam.
[23:33.72]I don't do facecam streams.
[23:35.80]I'm sorry.
[23:36.42]I just don't.
[23:40.48]And, like, if I change it here... Look, if I go into my settings and I change my audio delay, it's gonna, like, fuck up the whole stream.
[23:48.43]I have to turn the stream off to do that.
[23:51.17]I have to kill the stream to change my audio delay.
[23:56.29]The computers are stupid, okay?
[23:59.53]Computers are stupid.
[24:01.44]They're not fucking worth buying.
[24:10.29]What if it said, I hope I die?
[24:12.23]Jesus Christ.
[24:15.99]That's fucking harsh, man.
[24:19.73]I understand your opinion for thinking I'm an idiot or something, but Jesus Christ.
[24:25.80]Sorry you feel that way.
[24:28.28]Damn.
[24:33.78]Mod him.
[24:41.14]I hope you live.
[24:43.35]That's harsh, man.
[24:48.41]Drink to that.
[25:00.56]Do I still live in Massachusetts?
[25:01.62]Yes, I do.
[25:03.80]I have moved.
[25:05.52]I have moved.
[25:09.96]Yeah, like a couple of years.
[25:12.25]When did I actually move?
[25:14.77]Three years ago?
[25:15.49]Two years ago?
[25:16.17]Something like that?
[25:19.59]Can you guys hear this thing chugging away, by the way?
[25:22.19]This thing is just blasting power out of its ass.
[25:24.72]It's just like...
[25:35.45]Anyways, mostly lost, thanks for the $5.
[25:37.71]You know what's a great, interesting game and a cult classic?
[25:41.14]The movies.
[25:44.64]You want me to show my hand?
[25:46.04]Fine.
[25:48.54]No.
[25:49.20]No, that's a mistake.
[25:49.84]I'm not going to show my hand.
[25:51.86]No.
[25:52.26]You'll just see.
[25:53.53]You'll see.
[25:58.25]Look, the best dealers in Vegas don't show their whole hand.
[26:01.66]They fucking cheat, and they make sure that they get blackjack, and they fuck the whole table.
[26:06.65]The best dealers don't show the whole hand.
[26:08.05]You know, they hide two aces, they hide two jacks.
[26:11.07]Up their fucking sleeve.
[26:12.83]And they, like, thwop it out there, like, when all the cards are down.
[26:16.34]No.
[26:25.76]You gotta know when to hold them and when to fold them.
[26:27.53]And we're gonna hold them.
[26:34.66]Steelers fuck the table.
[26:36.18]Sometimes they do.
[26:41.41]Wise man breaks up the casino monopoly.
[26:46.15]Ow, my fucking knee.
[26:48.55]Ow, my knee.
[26:49.85]I'm upset now.
[26:50.63]You know when you bump your fucking knee?
[26:52.73]Here's the thing.
[26:56.24]You know when you stub your toe and you look at the thing that you stubbed your toe on or you bumped your elbow on
[27:04.83]And you're just like, you're angry at this thing.
[27:08.37]And you're trying to find any possible way to get rid of it.
[27:12.15]I stubbed my toe on my coffee table like two weeks ago.
[27:15.26]And I was going to throw the coffee table in the trash.
[27:22.30]I was like, I don't need this.
[27:23.64]I'm throwing it in the trash.
[27:26.36]This coffee table was like 300 bucks.
[27:27.62]Don't do that.
[27:32.81]I was like, I grabbed it and I like picked it up.
[27:36.10]I'm strong.
[27:36.78]I'm a strong man.
[27:38.08]I picked up the coffee table with fucking no help.
[27:40.82]Usually it takes like two or three people to pick up a small coffee table.
[27:43.82]And I fucking just picked it up and put it down.
[27:45.78]And I was like, God damn, I look good.
[27:48.80]Then we moved on.
[27:49.42]I got that confidence build up.
[28:10.04]I know the feel.
[28:12.14]Strong, scary streamer.
[28:13.82]I'm just passing time right now.
[28:19.32]Streamer is rich with a golden coffee table.
[28:21.28]No, it's got like... Okay, for a second, I was just gonna like bring you guys upstairs and look at the coffee table.
[28:29.63]It's got like stone in the middle.
[28:32.53]Why do we do... I don't know if it's an American thing.
[28:36.57]It might be like an American thing.
[28:38.37]Maybe it's like a world thing.
[28:39.61]I don't know.
[28:41.07]But when you like move into a new place, why do we want to buy new shit?
[28:46.77]Oh, you know, we needed, I want a new coffee table and like a new end table.
[28:50.75]I have two end tables that I don't use.
[28:54.30]I bought them.
[28:55.72]Oh no, that'll be great.
[28:56.76]People could like come, people could come over and like put their drink on there.
[29:00.82]Nobody comes over here.
[29:03.10]Nobody fucking comes over my house.
[29:04.98]I don't have any fucking friends that come up like what am I talking about?
[29:08.18]Oh, no, you can like the snack and like put the dip I'll have like I'll have like a tray a dip that I can go sit on the coffee tip.
[29:14.45]Nobody comes over here What the fuck am I talking about?
[29:18.33]What do I need to end tables?
[29:20.89]And like a coffee table like my coffee table.
[29:23.49]You know my car You know, it's on my coffee table right now right this fucking second.
[29:27.45]It's a bunch of mail.
[29:28.41]I
[29:29.84]I'm not having, like, the in-brain mind party.
[29:33.54]In my brain, whenever you buy, like, a bunch of furniture, you're having a big party.
[29:39.40]Why?
[29:40.14]I'm not gonna... I've never had a party over here.
[29:43.24]Ever.
[29:43.84]I've never had one fucking more than two people over this house, ever.
[29:48.51]But when I bought this furniture, I'm sitting there thinking to myself, man, it's gonna be a pretty good party that I have.
[29:53.77]I don't have any fucking parties.
[29:57.43]What the fuck?
[29:59.86]95%.
[30:06.15]Just invite all of chat.
[30:07.17]Yeah, all like 2,300 people come over and like party in my coffee table.
[30:13.83]I swear to God your PS3 has a 100 RPM drive.
[30:28.24]100 RPM.
[30:30.90]This thing sucks.
[30:34.06]Come on, man.
[30:34.66]This is a PS3 Slim.
[30:37.61]This is one of the good models.
[30:43.59]I love this stand-up routine.
[30:47.94]We're just having a fucking blast.
[30:49.64]We're just having a good time, alright?
[30:53.18]Friday night, it's 10 o'clock Eastern Time.
[30:55.84]We're not even wait.
[30:56.46]We just got started.
[30:57.52]Okay, we're just the stream just cut started crack a fucking cold one if you're over the age of 26 then you're allowed to drink on stream That's a rule But the slim sucks, what are you talking about?
[31:16.02]Do my airplane food bit Somebody's what I want to go to bed.
[31:21.24]Oh
[31:23.47]I'm so sorry.
[31:24.23]You know, let's talk about this too.
[31:27.67]I feel so bad about like... I look weird.
[31:33.20]Do I look weird?
[31:37.39]I'm sure I'm like covering my modesty.
[31:40.73]I feel bad, by the way, about starting... Here you go.
[31:46.81]Calm down.
[31:47.77]Wait a second.
[31:48.41]Stop.
[31:49.15]Wait a minute.
[31:52.23]I felt bad over the last year.
[31:54.51]You know my one-year anniversary on Twitch?
[31:58.76]Streaming with a consistent actual schedule is coming up in a month or two.
[32:06.90]September 27th.
[32:10.01]My 28th is my one year anniversary on Twitch with a schedule, right?
[32:15.40]I feel like really terrible about no EU friendly streams.
[32:21.58]And I think this is very tentative.
[32:25.71]But over the next couple of months after the summertime is over, because there's a couple of projects that me and some people are working on.
[32:35.64]Projects, like video projects that you're probably going to see over the next few months, hopefully.
[32:41.93]But I want to incorporate an EU-friendly time once a week.
[32:49.42]So I'm going to add a day to streams.
[32:52.86]So they'll be like, I'm assuming it's probably going to be Monday.
[32:56.10]So Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.
[32:59.07]Thursday Friday will be like the new schedule and Monday will end up being like a three or four o'clock eastern time start because I mean like I feel like a lot of you guys stay up fucking really goddamn late and it's it's like fucking 5 a.m for a lot of you guys and I love streaming I have a ton of fucking fun when I stream for the most part obviously you've seen a lot of times when I've like this is not done uh you've seen a lot of times when I've streamed in it like obviously a half like
[33:29.91]You know, sometimes I get frustrated and get angry, but that's live.
[33:33.05]That's a live TV.
[33:35.31]I don't fucking put candy on my shit.
[33:36.86]Like we talked about this the other day.
[33:38.08]I don't put candy on this shit.
[33:39.34]You know what I mean?
[33:40.70]Like fucking wipe this fucking lens off.
[33:42.82]I don't put candy on my lens.
[33:45.36]Like if I'm upset about something or if I'm not fucking cool.
[33:52.62]You know what I mean?
[33:53.12]Like there it is.
[33:54.48]I'm not going to pretend.
[34:01.88]candy streamer smudge did I smudge it I did fix that right now hold on a second let me I got it there we go there it is okay I'm sorry that was fucking stupid 99
[34:30.67]My hair looks like a sweaty hobo.
[34:32.55]Whoa!
[34:34.63]Everybody quiet.
[34:35.61]Quiet down.
[34:38.35]Time to start the game.
[34:42.66]Where's my controller?
[34:45.50]I lost the controller.
[34:47.16]How was that?
[34:47.62]Oh, it's right here.
[34:53.71]Idiot.
[34:53.85]Okay, let's play Wheelman.
[34:57.03]Powered by Unreal.
[34:57.87]That's how you know it's good.
[34:58.75]That's how you know they take like 40% of the profits.
[35:04.93]I'm so... I don't... What is with me today?
[35:07.41]And like just talking shit.
[35:08.65]I'm not sure what it is.
[35:16.08]Alright.
[35:16.40]Options.
[35:21.28]This game is going to be fucking terrible.
[35:25.07]Crash camera on.
[35:26.15]Vibration off.
[35:28.25]Auto-save on.
[35:32.49]Implying this game had profits.
[35:37.27]That's true.
[35:39.17]It probably... Vin Diesel's on the cover.
[35:41.06]Somebody bought it.
[35:43.06]Some fucking idiot walked into GameStop and was like, I like Vin Diesel.
[35:46.72]And they bought this game and like a hundred million other people did.
[35:52.74]Look, I would have bought this game when I was like fucking 17.
[35:54.56]Because I was an idiot.
[35:56.90]We're all idiots.
[35:57.88]You're not an idiot.
[35:58.94]Look, you're not an idiot.
[36:01.66]I bought this game.
[36:03.10]But I bought this game... I'm not an idiot.
[36:05.91]I purchased it for other purposes.
[36:15.22]New game, let's get Vin Diesel to... Hey, let's get Vin Diesel to half-assed phone in a bunch of fucking lines.
[36:25.46]You guys ready for Vin Diesel to fucking, like, wake up at 9 o'clock in the morning and, like, stumble into an LA studio and record a bunch of shit lines?
[36:33.97]I am.
[36:37.43]Melee attacks are essential for taking out enemy vehicles while you're traveling at high speeds.
[36:42.57]That's terrible advice.
[36:45.52]Don't ever punch a car at high speeds thinking you're going to break it.
[36:48.64]You're going to explode your hand.
[36:52.11]Don't... Okay.
[36:54.83]Don't ask me what that means.
[37:01.83]Was this a movie?
[37:07.42]Was Wheelman a movie before it was a game?
[37:10.20]Or was it just a video game?
[37:11.12]Like a terrible game?
[37:12.52]Is the game terrible?
[37:14.17]It might be.
[37:15.45]Stay tuned.
[37:15.83]We'll find out.
[37:22.77]There was a long time ago I saw four people at the coin store and I got really mad at them.
[37:30.65]I'm going to kick their ass.
[37:32.99]Big time.
[37:35.47]That's me.
[37:36.83]The real man.
[37:37.79]And I'm a badass.
[37:41.49]Are you?
[37:44.01]Come on, talk.
[37:48.17]Talk.
[37:54.09]There was this girl that I saw.
[38:00.31]So I stepped on the gas.
[38:03.82]But I decided to pick her up and take her for a joy ride.
[38:09.00]Just like this.
[38:09.82]Get in.
[38:12.88]Venga, venga, venga!
[38:14.14]Venga.
[38:15.06]Venga!
[38:15.76]That's what I heard, so I stepped on the ga- It was in neutral.
[38:19.66]Unfortunately, I didn't put the car in drive.
[38:22.91]I put it in neutral.
[38:25.81]Moving off!
[38:26.79]R2 to accelerate.
[38:30.57]Mission failed.
[38:31.33]Okay.
[38:33.57]That's it.
[38:34.78]This is the game over.
[38:35.56]Game over.
[38:36.20]Next.
[38:46.49]Those are huge dives.
[38:49.42]Did Vin Diesel just get his face mapped?
[38:53.43]Did he do any voice work?
[38:59.76]Oh boy, why am I silent?
[39:06.02]Do you think I would have any words at all as Vin Diesel?
[39:12.91]Get out of the way.
[39:13.61]I'll follow your directions, jerk.
[39:15.41]This cough is really bad.
[39:29.03]Where are we going here?
[39:30.81]Don't you feel like that I just got thrown into this and there's no rhyme or reason to anything?
[39:35.77]I'm not gonna get handbrake turns, okay?
[39:42.51]You got it.
[39:45.23]Look, this is one of those games you can't run over pedestrians.
[39:47.70]What a joke.
[39:49.28]They dive 50 feet away to make sure you don't get hit.
[39:59.69]They can only afford his likeness.
[40:08.87]Punch the cars.
[40:11.45]Smash through the roadblock.
[40:13.21]Alright.
[40:14.61]You know, I'd love to hold right trigger to drive the car, but that apparently does not work.
[40:25.82]Alright.
[40:29.78]Is this supposed to be like the big thing that pulls you into the game?
[40:34.12]This is the big kicker?
[40:35.96]Wow, that opening sequence was so... Wow, that was kind of cool.
[40:39.42]I'm okay with that.
[40:40.34]Vehicle melee.
[40:42.25]Your vehicle is your weapon.
[40:43.43]Use right stick to perform a vehicle sideswipe.
[40:49.21]Are you kidding me?
[40:53.80]That... Give me a break.
[40:59.67]forward melee attack why does the car have melee this is so stupid I'm pressing up you can go you can do a forward swing with your car taxi
[41:32.18]When is this tutorial going to be over?
[41:36.64]Get on foot as Vin Diesel.
[41:37.68]Do I get to do anything else besides painfully drive in a straight line?
[41:46.36]Cycle through cameras.
[41:51.50]Okay.
[41:52.96]Good to know.
[41:54.16]Cop fell out of that car.
[41:57.27]Is this actually the game?
[41:59.71]That helicopter keeps coming down so painfully low to the ground.
[42:04.83]Dude, I am holding down right trigger and sometimes it just does not go.
[42:15.62]I'm going so slow!
[42:16.84]Drive!
[42:19.36]Okay, please drive?
[42:22.10]Please drive the car?
[42:38.51]I want to make sure we're real clear about this.
[42:42.84]It stopped.
[42:46.50]Oh, by the way.
[42:47.72]By the way, my OBS crashed.
[42:51.79]My OBS has crashed.
[42:52.85]I can't... My OBS is dead.
[42:54.83]It didn't work.
[42:57.89]So I cannot switch... can you guys... can you still see the screen?
[43:02.12]Are we still streaming?
[43:10.30]Is anything on the screen?
[43:15.65]Are we good?
[43:16.39]You can still see me playing the game?
[43:22.40]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[43:25.04]Why won't this car drive?
[43:27.09]Drive!
[43:27.71]Oh my god!
[43:34.93]You can see my search history.
[43:38.09]Okay, I want you guys to prove to me you can see the stream because OBS crashed.
[43:44.69]Prove to me you can see it.
[43:46.07]You see everything?
[43:47.25]Prove it to me.
[43:48.87]Prove it.
[43:51.36]What's happening right now?
[43:54.45]Prove it.
[44:04.17]Okay, you can see.
[44:05.69]Okay.
[44:06.25]Just making sure you guys weren't debating me.
[44:14.09]Stopped.
[44:14.71]Stopped.
[44:15.21]Okay, okay.
[44:16.19]Alright.
[44:22.07]parked on the side dude why does right trigger not drive the car I can't push it in all the way god damn it why does it open ops why do you have to crash when I do anything I mean what happened to the screen what are you talking about are you serious
[44:51.58]Is that my car?
[44:52.26]No.
[44:52.80]Okay.
[44:53.62]This fucking dumb clown car.
[44:54.90]Get out of the way.
[45:03.07]I'm gonna laugh so hard if there actually is no Vin Diesel dialogue in the whole game.
[45:19.97]The stream is black.
[45:21.71]No, it's not a black... What do you mean black screen?
[45:23.21]What are you... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[45:24.19]What are you talking about?
[45:27.88]Don't play me like that.
[45:28.88]God damn it.
[45:30.96]That's so irritating.
[45:32.04]And this car's gonna fucking explode, and I can't do anything about it.
[45:35.96]God.
[45:38.81]Nice.
[45:38.95]This game is really bad.
[45:39.85]Aren't you guys glad we waited, uh, like 26 minutes to install this fucking drive in a straight line and walk in the- whack in the car simulator?
[46:07.54]Why is it going on the screen?
[46:09.30]Is it?
[46:14.42]Sort out my OBS.
[46:15.42]Oh, there is no sorting out my OBS.
[46:17.56]It is just not responding.
[46:19.97]The only way to sort out my OBS is if I close it.
[46:22.23]Because it is hanging right now.
[46:26.27]Every time I try to turn on my webcam from a different scene, OBS crashes.
[46:33.16]Maybe you can see a scene.
[46:40.14]Stop.
[46:40.50]Somebody said stop braking.
[46:41.98]I am not braking the car.
[46:43.96]That's the video game not understanding that I'm holding right trigger.
[46:47.66]Trigger.
[46:49.24]Save right.
[46:49.66]Come on.
[46:53.12]Go right.
[46:53.58]Why did you tell me to go right?
[46:58.58]This person is dead.
[47:01.15]Holy shit, that- Wow.
[47:02.49]Unbelievable.
[47:04.29]If I was a Dark Souls boss, that person would be- See, it's happening again.
[47:15.59]What?
[47:17.03]GO!
[47:17.98]Jeez, I have to- I have to go backwards!
[47:29.50]Did you- Did you see-
[47:32.83]Okay, why does it stop?
[47:34.91]Why does right trigger stop?
[47:37.27]Just drive.
[47:44.37]Accelerate just stops working randomly.
[47:48.85]I don't know why.
[47:51.39]R2 doesn't work.
[47:57.19]Look, right now.
[47:58.64]Why?
[47:59.62]What are you doing?
[48:03.70]Come on, venga, venga, venga!
[48:10.56]Is it toggle?
[48:11.51]No, no way.
[48:13.89]I think it's a pressure thing, because I'm using a place... I'm using a Dualshock... Dualshock!
[48:18.75]Dualshock 4.
[48:19.45]This is insane!
[48:23.62]So maybe the pressure sensitivity is different and it's like not reading it correctly.
[48:28.00]But that guy didn't have to die.
[48:29.32]That's what he did.
[48:33.66]That guy didn't have to die.
[48:35.44]A Dushok.
[48:36.01]Yeah, I don't even know what a Dushok controller is.
[48:45.71]This opening sequence, I am so fucking done with.
[48:52.71]How long do you have to have this?
[48:54.42]And there's like an oil tanker that's gonna crash, and I'm gonna fly over, it's gonna be a jump.
[49:00.80]And I stopped the car, because apparently holding R2 does... We stopped at the greatest potential fucking time.
[49:07.56]And it's happening again.
[49:08.40]Good thing it was a scripted event.
[49:13.17]Good, good.
[49:14.69]You move well.
[49:17.94]Why would there be a frame?
[49:20.27]Look at how slow I'm driving.
[49:23.57]Jesus Christ.
[49:24.69]I'm feeling great.
[49:27.87]Performance anxiety.
[49:30.73]Why can I drive like this guy?
[49:36.72]Is there anything else to do in this game?
[49:40.29]Do I have any guns?
[49:42.25]Or any... Any sequences?
[49:44.37]Any dialogue?
[49:46.24]Does anything happen?
[49:48.42]What?
[49:49.06]Allie!
[49:51.71]What?
[49:57.43]This is not how you drive a car through an alley.
[50:01.30]Alright, give me a gun.
[50:03.40]Do I get a gun?
[50:04.56]Nope, I don't get a gun.
[50:23.76]wheel oh oh alright we made it we made it am I supposed to go in here I guess so I hope so they're gone nice driving
[50:42.10]We need to abandon this car.
[50:43.88]The police will spot it anywhere.
[50:45.86]I have arranged a new ride for us.
[50:47.95]I marked it on the map.
[50:49.51]Let's go.
[50:51.87]Do you ever work with a crew?
[50:54.83]We play well together.
[50:58.83]But ice cold doesn't matter.
[51:01.41]I fence it easy.
[51:02.92]Bankroll something bigger.
[51:05.78]That pique your interest?
[51:08.25]Oh, I hate this game.
[51:10.51]I really hate this game.
[51:16.31]There's got to be something.
[51:17.65]Give me something else to do.
[51:18.67]We waited a long time for this.
[51:26.86]Talk, Vin Diesel.
[51:28.98]Speak, please.
[51:32.17]I thought it was him speaking that.
[51:35.21]Okay, here we go.
[51:35.81]Nice.
[51:36.87]We finally get to be on foot.
[51:45.12]Silent protagonist, Vin Diesel.
[51:55.49]I don't wanna.
[51:55.91]Is this a fast car?
[51:56.61]Is this fast enough?
[51:57.67]This is like an old lady car.
[51:59.13]I think this is like an old man car.
[52:05.60]This isn't even a good car.
[52:23.83]I can't wait for the first line of dialogue from Vin Diesel.
[52:27.81]Yeah.
[52:29.01]That's it.
[52:29.45]You did good.
[52:30.81]But I'm glad that's over.
[52:31.87]You did good.
[52:33.39]I am glad that it's over.
[52:34.67]So, are you happy about the last mission?
[52:37.67]It's good for business.
[52:39.80]Too bad nothing lasts forever.
[52:42.52]I agree.
[52:44.54]Too bad nothing lasts forever.
[52:47.10]I will not ask why you left the States.
[52:53.45]One shot, one kill.
[52:54.79]It does sound like what it is.
[52:59.47]Come on, give me something interesting.
[53:01.17]Something interesting, wheel man.
[53:03.92]Not this bullshit.
[53:04.90]God damn it.
[53:17.86]I'm not leaving you.
[53:19.38]Can you take people's cars?
[53:21.96]Get in.
[53:23.22]You're getting in the wrong side.
[53:24.80]Get in the car.
[53:25.42]You're getting in the wrong way.
[53:26.42]Alright, did she get in?
[53:27.98]She's in.
[53:28.46]I almost got him.
[53:30.58]I'm gonna get him.
[53:31.48]I'm gonna get him.
[53:49.11]You're not going to dive away from me.
[53:50.25]I'm going to... Here he goes.
[53:53.59]Go off that jump!
[54:02.62]Fucking come on.
[54:04.48]Hey, Vin Diesel.
[54:08.48]Go off that jump.
[54:10.66]Okay.
[54:12.60]Float it!
[54:19.50]Come on, we need a car.
[54:21.44]Let's go.
[54:22.42]Get me out of here.
[54:25.18]Hey, hold on.
[54:26.26]Come on, get in the marker.
[54:27.77]Get in the marker, you dummy.
[54:32.13]Venga.
[54:32.77]Any car will do.
[54:33.79]No, we don't need a car.
[54:34.41]Get in here.
[54:35.39]Come on.
[54:35.67]Come on, come on, come on.
[54:36.63]Get in the green ooze.
[54:37.73]Come on.
[54:40.11]This music, seriously.
[54:42.38]Just get in the car.
[54:43.70]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:01.62]Standing in the circle, and now I have to do the whole thing again.
[55:04.90]We need to abandon this car.
[55:06.66]The police will spot it anywhere.
[55:08.66]I have arranged a new ride for us.
[55:10.74]I marked it on the mark.
[55:12.20]Let's go.
[55:15.40]You have a work with the crew.
[55:17.60]We play well together.
[55:21.24]The police can't be too far behind.
[55:23.02]We need this car.
[55:50.97]Content.
[55:52.65]Watch out for the explosion, Vin.
[55:54.13]Oh, I tried to go to my OBS.
[55:56.25]I can't do that.
[56:00.08]I forgot.
[56:02.30]I can't use my OBS.
[56:04.24]I was about to use my OBS.
[56:05.90]Just use it.
[56:06.38]This car's fine.
[56:07.18]It's just a little beat up.
[56:08.02]Let's get out of here.
[56:13.53]Take me to the drop.
[56:18.38]Just reset OBS.
[56:20.35]Oh, but like, you know how that works.
[56:22.09]If the stream ends, a thousand people leave.
[56:24.90]You know, everybody knows that's the case.
[56:27.32]Everybody knows that's how that works.
[56:30.06]If I turn the stream off for 5 seconds, 60,000 people leave.
[56:32.72]Plug in the voice.
[56:33.70]You say this every- It's true!
[56:34.98]That's a true statement.
[56:53.31]Better we each keep our own secrets.
[56:57.74]Sellout.
[57:01.98]I leave even when you're streaming.
[57:04.03]Come on, don't fuck with my self-confidence.
[57:07.73]Come on, I have confidence issues.
[57:09.15]Don't fuck with them.
[57:11.87]There are 24,000 people here right now.
[57:13.80]Don't fuck with my self-confidence.
[57:16.99]You know, like, when I talk to people and they say, how many people do you have on the stream last night?
[57:20.25]60,000 people!
[57:23.07]And the whole time I'm red.
[57:24.05]Alright, I win.
[57:33.34]I just said that and 30 people left.
[57:34.66]So what do you do for excitement around here?
[57:39.48]You just talk.
[57:40.90]What you need is a tour guide.
[57:43.02]You always work solo?
[57:43.92]Why?
[57:46.08]You looking for a dance partner?
[57:48.30]Maybe.
[57:48.80]But I'm gonna need a team that knows exactly what they're doing.
[57:53.30]I prefer to work with people who know how to stay behind the scenes.
[57:57.22]Gotta be careful with people like that.
[57:59.12]Sometimes they're hard to find when you need them.
[58:07.89]With me, you always know right where I am.
[58:11.73]Behind the wheel.
[58:18.60]Okay, good.
[58:19.82]I hope that's the only fucking time he talks.
[58:21.56]Okay, what do you do for excitement around here?
[58:34.53]Ah, LumiVega is well known in the... I don't care about any of that.
[58:37.83]Who cares?
[58:42.31]Venga, Venga.

[59:51.99]Somewhere in Barcelona.
[59:53.85]The various criminal factions will be looking to get their hands on it and... Yeah, and sell it to the high... I had to.
[60:00.45]Sorry.
[60:03.49]I couldn't do that anymore.
[60:04.53]That was putting me to bed.

[61:03.62]I don't care.
[61:04.10]Three stolen cars.
[61:18.90]Why would you be in front of the car like this?
[61:22.10]Okay, that guy just like I just went skydiving on the ground
[61:46.49]And that's a motorcycle.
[61:47.68]So, uh, yeah.
[61:48.92]We're gonna take the motorcycle.
[61:56.00]Of course we're gonna take the motorcycle.
[61:57.82]Why would we not?
[62:00.02]Are you serious?
[62:04.11]There are no consequences.
[62:05.45]There it is.
[62:08.57]Okay, we're gonna get it.
[62:13.48]You can jump from vehicle to vehicle.
[62:16.88]Hold circle behind the car.
[62:20.14]What?
[62:22.93]You see air, Jack?
[62:26.41]You gotta be kidding me.
[62:33.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:36.56]Why did they just give me a cutscene?
[62:39.78]I don't understand.
[62:41.78]I went the wrong way, I think.
[62:44.42]I don't know why he just gave me a cutscene.
[62:49.13]Good cutscene.
[62:55.65]Why is he doing this?
[63:00.53]Oh my god.
[63:03.53]Where did he go?
[63:04.33]He's back here, okay.
[63:11.55]You can't fall off the motorcycle.
[63:13.53]It's not possible.
[63:19.22]The motorcycles are so fast.
[63:20.74]I'll get him.
[63:21.12]I'll get back to him in a second.
[63:39.06]That's not what happens when you get in a fucking motorcycle accident.
[63:43.84]That's absolutely not what happens when you get in a motorcycle fucking crash.
[63:50.91]Alright, I'll catch him.
[63:54.61]Don't worry, we'll get him.
[64:01.33]Good turn, good turn.
[64:02.91]Smooth turn, we're good.
[64:07.98]Minute and 30 seconds.
[64:08.78]He's right there.

[64:13.04]I'm going to cut him off.
[64:13.86]Cut him off.
[64:14.28]Cut him off.
[64:14.64]Cut him off.

[64:49.43]It's that easy.
[64:51.21]That's it.
[64:51.91]I win.
[64:53.26]Nice jump.
[64:54.02]Nice jump.
[64:55.24]That's it.
[64:55.62]Got it.
[64:56.06]Got the car.
[65:14.26]Ah, there it is.
[65:16.26]You can do this to any car at any time.
[65:19.34]What a monstrosity of a game.
[65:25.62]I gotta get another car.
[65:27.18]Oh my lord, really?
[65:39.46]Last.
[65:40.20]Only two more of those.
[65:42.22]Well this time I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[65:45.92]You can airjack traffic vehicles as well as enemy vehicles.
[65:48.89]Okay.
[65:51.63]So like this guy.
[65:58.13]I love how he's like getting ready to jump out.
[66:01.61]But right trigger don't work.
[66:02.95]Let's just get this one.
[66:05.49]Oh my fucking god.
[66:07.61]Why does this not work?
[66:15.08]I'm just preparing.
[66:16.94]Alright, go!
[66:18.64]Well, that was cool.
[66:20.96]Nice, alright, who wants the next car?
[66:24.49]How about this one?
[66:40.61]He looks so dumb.
[66:45.87]Nothing about that is fucking interesting.
[66:48.06]That's so stupid.
[66:50.76]Huh?
[66:51.70]Alright, I'm gonna be looking for a car right now.
[66:54.96]How about this one right here?
[66:56.86]Oh, that one.
[66:57.32]That looks like a good car.
[66:59.27]I'll take it.
[67:09.68]Is that a bad guy?
[67:10.52]Oh look, it's a bad guy car!
[67:13.09]What?
[67:13.23]What are you doing?
[67:15.69]There's the convert- Yeah, I know.
[67:16.87]I just found it.
[67:22.09]Air Jack the convertible.
[67:23.37]You got it.
[67:26.43]This is torture.
[67:30.89]No, it's not.
[67:31.57]It's fine.
[67:34.47]It's not torture.
[67:36.52]It's just like fairly terrible.
[67:39.00]It's alright.
[67:41.22]Don't worry.
[67:41.66]There's more to this game.
[67:45.33]We're gonna see it.
[67:45.87]This is just like Jim Carrey in fucking Ace Majora.
[67:59.08]Here we go - right now.
[68:06.26]This is gonna be so bad. What a fucking joke.
[68:14.26]Needs more motion blur.
[68:21.26]Oh woops, hold on.
[68:31.26]I'll get it.
[68:31.82]I'm gonna get back in it.
[68:32.70]Why is the accelerator being pushed?
[68:36.72]No one's driving this car.
[68:40.57]Just get in there.
[68:47.17]I have 47 seconds.
[68:48.57]Don't fuck this up.
[68:49.37]Get this over with.
[68:56.83]We have to see what else is in this game.
[68:58.40]I need to know.
[68:59.46]It's very important.
[69:09.91]Easy now.
[69:10.35]Come on.
[69:16.27]30 seconds to relief.
[69:20.94]Don't say never.
[69:22.14]Never say never.
[69:26.86]Bingo.
[69:29.69]Next car.
[69:38.05]Get up.
[69:40.01]Five minutes.
[69:42.95]Next, next, next, next.
[69:46.93]Look, I know.
[69:47.43]I know this game's not the greatest, but we have... I told you, we have to put an hour into each game.
[69:52.22]That's how it works.
[69:52.90]We can't just not do it.
[69:53.92]We have to give it time.
[69:55.12]I'm just squatting.
[70:08.04]Why?
[70:08.54]Why?
[70:08.97]We have to give an hour to each game.
[70:12.81]Oh, look, that's an hour.
[70:13.69]No, it's not!
[70:14.53]It's not an hour!
[70:15.37]We're still on the same mission!
[70:21.59]We're on the same mission, guys.
[70:26.98]There he is.
[70:30.36]Oh, God.
[70:35.62]This mission hasn't ended yet.
[70:41.41]There he is.
[70:43.69]It's been like five minutes.
[70:44.89]This bike is broken.
[70:47.21]Jesus Christ.
[70:55.71]There you go.
[70:58.43]Yeah, there he is.
[70:59.29]There's the Pontiac.
[71:04.68]There he is.
[71:12.48]I tried.
[71:13.44]I tried to make like a joke.
[71:15.11]I'm trying.
[71:16.17]I'm trying.
[71:16.87]That's not how cars work.
[71:21.47]You don't just sit down and pretend to drive it.
[71:23.15]Alright, let's go.
[71:33.28]There it is.
[71:35.42]Just jump inside of his car.
[71:39.18]It's gonna be real easy.
[71:43.13]One.

[77:57.56]Why do people want me to play this so bad?
[77:59.42]What is in this game that's worth anything?
[78:02.32]This is a dumb joke game.
[78:13.05]Get over here.

[79:04.11]I know what we're going to play.
[79:25.54]I'm going to save this game real quick in case we ever want to come back to it.
[79:31.92]I'd love to turn my webcam on.

[79:46.29]Restart OBS.
[79:50.45]Alright, I'm going to...
[79:55.76]I don't know.
[79:56.32]No, this game's only going to be like 10 minutes.
[79:57.90]This game is a piece of garbage.
[80:01.18]We're getting through all the garbage games tonight.
[80:03.92]At least for the most part.
[80:06.22]It's not Haze.
[80:10.58]It's not an early copy of Knack 2.
[80:17.09]Alright, so there's 2,250 people here right now.
[80:18.27]If I turn off OBS and turn it back on...

[80:27.22]I'll be back in like fucking 30 seconds.
[80:28.88]You're gonna leave?
