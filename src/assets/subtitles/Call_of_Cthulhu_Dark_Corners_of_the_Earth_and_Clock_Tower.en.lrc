[00:58.05]Hey!
[01:00.81]What's going on everybody?
[01:01.75]Welcome to a Wednesday stream.
[01:04.27]It's me, your best friend, Jeremy.
[01:07.11]How you doing?
[01:17.38]You like how the title is the lyrics to Monster Bash?
[01:19.67]What?
[01:27.09]I don't know if I should be concerned or not.
[01:29.65]Let me go over a scenario with you guys.
[01:32.45]Every time I start a stream, we go over a scenario.
[01:36.31]And we talk about the scenario.
[01:37.96]We talk about if the scenario should be concerned with, right?
[01:43.44]First things first.
[01:44.30]Let's wait until people trickle in.
[01:45.66]I'm going to shut my fucking trap until people trickle in here.
[01:50.90]So give me a minute.
[01:51.42]I'll be right back.
[01:52.21]We're still like three minutes early.
[01:53.71]Just give me a sec.
[01:55.17]Here we go.
[02:00.56]Yeah.
[02:32.72]Alright.
[02:40.92]So... Here's the deal.
[02:45.09]I lost power for more than 20... Just about more than 24 hours, I think it was, at its peak.
[02:52.45]And inside the fridge was a pre-made Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee.
[02:58.28]It's in a bottle.
[02:59.92]Now, there's milk in this.
[03:01.71]It's coffee, skim milk, sugar, and cream.
[03:05.99]Right?
[03:07.67]Is it a bad idea for me, after 24 hours in the fridge of no power, should I not drink this?
[03:19.19]Don't do it.
[03:19.92]Throw it out.
[03:20.58]Throw it out, but it's probably sealed.
[03:23.28]It's probably okay.
[03:25.02]Right?
[03:25.24]It doesn't smell that bad.
[03:29.52]It smells fine.
[03:30.18]It doesn't taste bad.
[03:34.71]Drink, drink it, drink it.
[03:38.05]So when you lose power, your fridge doesn't become hot.
[03:43.22]My fridge just turned down a little.
[03:46.36]And unplugging it doesn't mean it's not cool in there still.
[03:50.10]Doesn't it stay cold in your fridge if you unplug it for at least a day or two?
[03:59.55]Think of the views.
[04:00.49]I'm not going to do it on camera, but that's not a big deal.
[04:06.67]We'll try.
[04:06.99]Well, if I have to, like, run away really quickly in the middle of this stream, it's because I got, like, fucking bad milk diarrhea.
[04:13.61]So the stream might end in, like, 45 minutes because of sour milk diarrhea.
[04:19.50]You'll find out.
[04:20.96]Stay tuned.
[04:24.87]You're a strong boy.
[04:26.11]You can handle it.
[04:36.11]It's cold.
[04:37.23]Did you freeze it to frost?
[04:38.27]Did you keep it closed?
[04:39.17]Yeah, I kept it closed.
[04:40.97]For the most part.
[04:42.71]I mean, like, it got a little hot in my house.
[04:46.70]So, instead of, like, turning on the heat, I opened up the fridge and the freezer to get that cool air to fill up the kitchen while I hung out there and played cards.
[04:55.28]So, I mean, it was closed for the most part.
[04:57.83]Yeah, it was open maybe, like, for six or seven hours.
[05:03.42]I'm gonna switch over to the game.
[05:06.22]I cannot alt-tab this game or it breaks.
[05:09.80]I got like the community patch.
[05:11.22]I got the FOV patch for Call of Cthulhu.
[05:14.10]But if I alt-tab, the stream will crash.
[05:19.02]So we need to be very careful about this.
[05:20.56]I need to open this game and not touch a damn thing but this monitor.
[05:25.96]So I apologize in advance if I cannot read bits for the rest of this.
[05:29.00]This is just like I can't read bits week.
[05:33.41]All these games are just so fragile.
[05:37.52]Call of Duty patch.
[05:38.48]Why is everyone saying Call of Duty?
[05:42.36]What's my favorite bird?
[05:43.24]I don't know.
[05:47.70]Ostrich.
[05:49.60]That's not true.
[05:52.42]Ostrich is just fucking stupid.
[05:55.46]That's a bird.
[05:57.78]You understand?
[05:59.04]That's a fucking bird.
[06:02.00]What kind of weird dinosaur creature is that?
[06:04.14]That's not a bird.
[06:10.48]It's a giant chicken horse.
[06:13.04]Alright, let's go.
[06:17.39]Alright, let me turn this on.
[06:20.65]It might be a little loud.
[06:22.49]I don't want you guys to get concerned.
[06:25.33]If it is, I'll turn it down.
[06:26.95]But I gotta make sure I have everything in the right place because I cannot alt-tab ever again.
[06:32.77]So, here we go.
[06:34.11]Loud?
[06:35.09]Might be loud.
[06:37.27]Can you see this?
[06:38.93]I hope you can, because otherwise it's gonna crash.
[06:43.36]Hope you can see this shit.
[06:52.62]Can you see the game?
[06:53.92]You can?
[06:57.36]You can?
[06:59.79]Let me, like, see if I can make it so I can see.
[07:01.85]Yeah, you can see this.
[07:02.57]You can see this.
[07:03.37]Alright, so we're going to play Call of... Tonight is Call of Cthulhu.
[07:10.97]Find me the... Find me the fucking historian that made up that name.
[07:18.38]Cthulhu.
[07:25.80]You know, guys know Edgar Allan Poe?
[07:29.05]Those stories were all real.
[07:30.21]He actually, like, had people in his, like, basement and shit.
[07:34.13]And they wrote about, like, a bunch of monsters under a different pen name.
[07:40.60]We're going to play Edgar Allan Poe Presents Call of Cthulhu.
[07:48.15]And I think, I'm pretty sure we're in the right spot.
[07:50.83]I have the FOV fix.
[07:54.70]Game tips are currently active.
[07:55.64]If you don't want to see game tips, they can be turned off from the game options.
[07:58.40]You can press the escape key at any time during gameplay and Edgar Allan Paul will jump scare you.
[08:08.54]Your title hurts my brain.
[08:11.67]Well, sorry, dude.
[08:17.81]Is Lovecraft a Minecraft YouTuber?
[08:21.23]It's laggy.
[08:22.99]What?
[08:24.99]Don't say that.
[08:26.83]I'll be very upset if it is.
[08:33.38]Is this the jump that he's going to force tonight?
[08:35.60]Hey!
[08:37.32]Yes.
[08:39.04]Of course it is.
[08:43.55]See, it's fine.
[08:44.01]Okay, well that's good.
[08:49.22]Yeah, something about menus.
[08:50.40]I think it's like a 60 FPS thing with these old games.
[08:54.64]Sorry, Jack.
[08:55.58]We had to call.
[08:56.63]This fellow will only talk to you.
[08:58.51]Name's Victor Holt.
[09:00.19]Don't know any Victor.
[09:02.23]He's the leader of this weird cult that moved in here a few months back.
[09:05.43]Did you hear that little squeak?
[09:06.73]Is that me being excited?
[09:07.83]They've been causing trouble all over town.
[09:09.99]Stealing, going through folks' trash.
[09:12.44]Hanging around outside people's homes at all hours.
[09:15.12]I made the, uh, twitch.tv joke before.
[09:17.78]Mac, if you're watching, just, like, take the stream yesterday, two days ago.
[09:21.94]We were just passing, you know, doing the normal rounds.
[09:24.02]Like, snip it up.
[09:24.62]Like, I made a really good, like, YouTuber joke.
[09:27.62]Gunshots?
[09:28.52]Like, three days ago.
[09:29.72]No one said anything about gunshots.
[09:31.70]Who've we got out here?
[09:33.68]Eh, just me, Nichols, and a few new recruits.
[09:37.52]Well, that's just great.
[09:39.76]Lead the way, Robert.
[09:41.12]Alright, so now, if you're probably noticing, we don't have 55 FOV anymore.
[09:48.00]We have actual 90 FOV, which means we don't have to throw up when we play this game.
[09:53.26]Oh, win!
[09:55.44]Dude, you hear we don't have to throw up when we play this game anymore?
[09:58.85]Win!
[10:03.58]What am I doing?
[10:04.16]I'm sorry.
[10:07.36]I think I saw him with Officer Armstrong.
[10:09.66]Just take it easy.
[10:10.58]This is where they get shot.
[10:11.86]This guy gets shot.
[10:12.62]Good evening, Jack.
[10:13.46]Glad you could join the freak show.
[10:15.30]How's it looking, Henry?
[10:16.90]I don't like this one bit, Jack.
[10:18.90]Check the alley on the right.
[10:21.42]There he goes.
[10:23.41]You and your FOV obsession.
[10:25.11]I can't play a game if it's not at least 80 FOV.
[10:27.43]You better take it slowly, though.
[10:29.47]They're a bit twitchy.
[10:32.02]there a bit.
[10:32.50]twitch.tv/Switch TV.
[10:34.88]Whoa, watching that guy die.
[10:36.26]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[10:41.27]Oh, I remember this part from the draft.
[10:44.29]Oh, that actually hurt my ears.
[10:50.47]Alright, so let's get in here.
[10:51.53]I'm going to open a couple of doors.
[10:54.80]There's a couple of rats.
[10:56.10]No big deal.
[10:56.86]We can find the guy.
[11:00.75]What an authentic streamer experience.
[11:02.63]How do I open up doors?
[11:03.57]They just open them by themselves.
[11:04.89]This is the save the eye thing.
[11:13.56]I remember this part.
[11:14.80]You look at the eye.
[11:15.68]It saves the game.
[11:18.02]Yeah, save over it.
[11:19.08]Because now we actually have a field of view.
[11:25.90]Okay, up the stairs.
[11:27.42]Alright, remember this?
[11:29.81]This guy gets shot after I try to question him and investigate him.
[11:36.81]He gets shot right in his chin.
[11:38.27]Where is he?
[11:42.94]It's not these two.
[11:43.68]Okay, which door is it, then?
[11:46.50]We already did this.
[11:47.28]I should... Oh, there it is.
[11:48.02]Mm-hmm.
[11:54.68]There it is.
[11:55.26]Don't shoot.
[11:57.52]Uh-huh.
[11:59.96]Yep.
[12:01.82]And there's a couple more.
[12:04.45]This one right here, right?
[12:07.31]There we go.
[12:07.65]Okay.
[12:07.81]This is where you get shot.
[12:14.31]And this is where we decided to stop playing because it was making me sick.
[12:17.35]Oh.
[12:25.68]Okay, you got him.
[12:26.54]Nice work.
[12:30.42]So now, what was I supposed to... What was I supposed to actually be doing in Call of Cthulhu?
[12:37.75]A mind beyond.
[12:38.95]That's what I would name the next game.
[12:42.87]Call of Cthulhu, Dark Horns of the Earth, Call of Cthulhu, A Mind Beyond.
[12:50.64]Um... What, in here?
[12:58.31]Do I have to go back outside?
[13:00.43]So they're still shooting at somebody that is in one of the windows?
[13:09.68]I guess?
[13:10.00]I don't know.
[13:19.34]I feel like I should be able to go in this door.
[13:20.67]Okay, well...
[13:26.52]Is there an actual, there's no actual interact button.
[13:29.14]I think I just have to smash my face into walls.
[13:38.04]Okay, that, that, wait a minute here.
[13:40.70]How do I open doors?
[13:44.29]Pull it back to crouch, sneak, action is S?
[13:47.81]Huh?
[13:50.74]What?
[13:52.38]Why is action S?
[13:57.03]I should probably change this to something else.
[14:01.07]So when I'm W-A-S-D-ing, I'm opening the doors.
[14:05.37]Okay.
[14:12.33]What do I want this to be?
[14:13.45]E, right?
[14:17.15]Lean right with you.
[14:20.80]Look, Strife.
[14:24.64]What kind of fucking controls are these?
[14:28.26]No, let's keep this at E. Action's gonna have to be... It's not F. G for go.
[14:36.20]Alright, it's gonna be G for go in.
[14:38.78]G for get in there.
[14:41.60]You got it.
[14:45.82]Wait.
[14:46.76]Why can I not move backwards?
[14:49.99]Hold on.
[14:50.99]Wait, wait.
[14:51.93]What the fuck?
[14:54.25]What is... That was not just like that.
[14:56.96]I was able to move backwards before.
[14:58.96]Huh?
[15:01.66]Okay.
[15:06.01]Alright, G, but get going!
[15:09.49]I can't open it.
[15:11.47]What's wrong?
[15:12.37]Poisoning by the looks of it.
[15:13.67]Alright, we're good.
[15:15.59]There's an insanity meter.
[15:16.59]We might make sure we don't lose it.
[15:18.01]Make sure we don't go insane.
[15:19.64]This will make interesting reading.
[15:23.80]You picked up your first journal item.
[15:25.10]Select the back icon in the interface to study your journal.
[15:28.02]It may reveal vital clues.
[15:29.42]When the book icon is grayed out, there are no new entries to read.
[15:33.91]Select the book icon in the interface.
[15:38.20]Oh, that's me.
[15:40.34]Oh, shit.
[15:42.47]I'm on a fucking... I'm on a lie detector test.
[15:46.99]I gotta be careful what I say here.
[15:48.33]You guys are gonna be asking me questions, and I'm gonna be fucking... You guys might not be telling the truth!
[15:54.55]Alright, what do I need?
[15:55.71]Books.
[15:57.95]The Diary of... This is awful looking.
[16:01.29]September 6th, 1915.
[16:02.97]Local disturbance.
[16:05.75]I guess I'm becoming a victim of my own success.
[16:08.81]After closing the last five cases so fast, the papers have been calling me a local hero.
[16:13.41]Yeah, who cares about you?
[16:17.81]There's more.
[16:18.47]More to read.
[16:19.11]Who wants to read, like, a book?
[16:24.87]This one, right?
[16:26.30]Diary of a cult member.
[16:29.64]They keep a diary, I guess.
[16:33.61]Dear Diary, I gouged out Frank's eyeballs last night because he didn't believe in the one true Cthulhu.
[16:43.07]Okay, um... I thought that said something else I was about to say.
[16:47.13]That's a little lewd for me.
[16:49.12]That's a little weird.
[16:49.92]Look at the way that's connected.
[16:54.50]That's clearly like a triple M. This is like the meme with the sexual humor lately.
[17:01.70]Get over it, me.
[17:05.76]Alright.
[17:08.64]Nothing collected.
[17:11.19]I have a syringe.
[17:11.95]Alright, let's go.
[17:15.93]Should I be taking the syringe to make it so that I don't go crazy?
[17:19.57]He's dead.
[17:21.17]They're all dead.
[17:23.20]What is wrong with me?
[17:25.48]Nothing of interest.
[17:29.46]Why is the screen shaking?
[17:32.78]This hurts to look at.
[17:34.24]I can't open it.
[17:36.04]Can I get out of here?
[17:37.42]Okay, being in here is causing me problems.
[17:49.29]So I'm going crazy when I'm in this room.
[17:51.07]Well, what is in here that I need to get if something is so crazy?
[17:54.37]Want diaries?
[18:08.77]Oh, man.
[18:09.69]This is not... I don't like this.
[18:11.09]I don't like the fucking shaky-ass screen.
[18:14.07]The book?
[18:14.85]I can't, like, touch it.
[18:15.59]They can't touch that green book.
[18:20.89]Again, this is, like, causing me so many problems.
[18:23.51]Fucking vomit.
[18:24.23]Vomit vision.
[18:41.35]Alright, let's leave this, because I sincerely can't put up with vomit vision anymore.
[18:46.47]Oh, there's a key.
[18:47.43]You picked up an item.
[18:53.67]Open the inventory and view this item and get its description.
[18:57.95]Okay.
[18:59.71]This is a copper key with an S engraved on the head.
[19:02.82]S. For open.
[19:12.16]S for open.
[19:14.44]It won't budge.
[19:16.24]It won't open.
[19:17.60]The lock on this door is broken.
[19:20.44]The lock on this door is broken.
[19:21.76]What about this one?
[19:26.36]It won't open.
[19:29.17]S. I would assume it's S for staircase.
[19:38.39]S for...
[19:40.18]Yeah, here we go.
[19:43.11]Okay, well, never mind.
[19:48.67]Now it's unlocked.
[19:50.77]I must have unlocked it with the key.
[19:55.21]Oh, here's another key.
[19:56.14]Let's take a look at some of the lore here to make sure we're not missing anything.
[20:03.54]The Chronicle.
[20:07.36]Day 13.
[20:08.02]Leave home.
[20:09.14]Arrive at station.
[20:10.58]Leave station.
[20:11.36]Lunch.
[20:11.92]Go to bank.
[20:12.84]Back to station.
[20:13.70]Follow suspect.
[20:14.82]Stakeout.
[20:17.20]Return home.
[20:21.42]Is this... Somebody's got, like, lava in here?
[20:23.98]That's not fire.
[20:24.76]That's just coals.
[20:29.21]I guess coals are fire.
[20:32.09]What am I talking about?
[20:33.19]Let's go unlock the other door.
[20:38.83]Mm-hmm.
[20:42.82]So we got our first test here.
[20:45.86]I hear a guy moaning.
[20:47.28]This might be the first scare of the evening.
[20:51.70]Mm-hmm.
[20:52.06]Yep.
[20:52.30]There sure are.
[21:08.21]like walking on somebody like having sex you know there's some strange sounds over here I wonder what's going on inside this bedroom can this be opened I mean this clearly looks like a place to go how do I get in here I can't open this
[21:39.25]The game crashed.
[21:46.37]Okay.
[21:47.89]Alright.
[21:48.13]Oh god, fucking damn it.
[21:56.09]Why did the game, like, decided to crash when I clicked on that thing?
[22:03.63]Uh-huh.
[22:04.15]Well.
[22:05.91]Okay, let's do it again.
[22:12.62]Let's see if we can go try and it's not even saved.
[22:20.94]God damn it.
[22:24.58]God damn it.
[22:28.60]Darn it.
[22:30.20]Let's try it again.
[22:31.10]I know where the keys are now.
[22:36.37]I do have the community patch.
[22:39.15]I do have the fix.
[22:40.59]I have the bug fix, the FOV fix.
[22:44.69]Alright, we'll try it again.
[22:49.37]Continue.
[22:51.08]Does that... The question I have for people that are currently watching... Do I actually need to go in that...
[23:08.76]Get the key.
[23:09.58]No, the key's in the other one.
[23:10.46]God damn it.
[23:11.56]I do have to go in there.
[23:14.62]So, was it just, like, breaking for me?
[23:16.89]Do I have to fix for the fix?
[23:23.67]I don't know.
[23:25.23]Do I?
[23:25.67]Okay.
[23:35.79]Got the key.
[23:36.75]Down, down, down, down, down.
[23:38.05]Yep.
[23:40.05]There's nothing in here.
[23:40.63]Who cares?
[23:41.03]What?
[23:47.53]Oh.
[23:50.65]Get this key.
[23:54.18]Save ourselves a few minutes.
[23:55.48]Look at the eyeballs.
[23:56.24]Save it.
[23:56.46]Hello.
[23:56.58]What?
[24:06.17]Come on, save the game.
[24:13.58]Wait, is somebody writing like, you've been banned in the chat?
[24:16.86]What are you talking about?
[24:17.90]Nobody's banned in the chat right now.
[24:22.38]Here's the guy that's singing in the shower.
[24:24.04]Yes, there are.
[24:24.78]Okay, so this, don't crash.
[24:35.06]There we go.
[24:35.78]I was supposed to open it.
[24:42.24]Pretty intense.
[24:42.99]I just like fell down the stairs.
[24:45.61]I just slide down.
[24:47.55]Okay, let's go.
[24:48.51]Here we are.
[24:49.09]This is gonna happen again.
[24:50.05]There's the guy that was in the shower.
[24:53.95]He can't be spoken to.
[24:55.01]It almost happened to me too.
[24:57.13]And now we're in the hospital.
[25:05.01]Be careful.
[25:05.55]I've played enough video games to know that one of these guys might get up and try to get me.
[25:14.68]And there's Cthulhu's brain.
[25:15.88]There it is.
[25:16.18]Okay.
[25:34.80]Dead guy?
[25:35.22]Dead guy?
[25:37.88]Oh shit.
[25:40.75]Did I not have done that?
[25:43.73]Uh-oh.
[25:44.31]It's the beginning of Half-Life.
[25:45.27]We have to push this guy into the thing in the middle.
[25:47.64]And get teleported to the... What's the name of those guys?
[25:50.52]What's the name of those guys with the one eye?
[25:53.89]The Fraggles.
[25:55.15]What are the Fraggles?
[25:56.21]What are the Fraggles?
[25:57.35]The guys in Half-Life 1.
[25:59.66]Greetings to the free man.
[26:01.52]What's his name?
[26:04.02]The Albuquerque.
[26:11.60]The Vonnegots.
[26:12.81]The Vordegots.
[26:15.43]The Fraggles.
[26:16.33]The crystal's still warm.
[26:20.11]You know what I was trying to say.
[26:21.33]We got the crystals.
[26:22.86]guy's dead machine must have overloaded okay he's dead this is like actually pretty great his heart has stopped his lungs have stopped ventilating his stomach stopped moving feel like he's singing a song his brain stopped moving his intestines have stopped moving his kidneys have stopped moving
[26:42.72]His intestines have stopped moving.
[26:44.77]His kidneys have stopped moving.
[26:46.61]His brain stopped moving.
[26:48.53]It stopped moving.
[26:49.59]His heart has stopped.
[26:51.11]His lungs have stopped.
[26:52.39]His stomach stopped moving.
[26:53.69]Alright.
[26:54.19]We all know.
[26:54.97]Thank you for the anatomy class.
[26:56.20]Let's put the crystal in.
[26:56.96]I've never seen equipment like this before.
[26:59.38]The brain doesn't move.
[27:00.54]None of those things move, by the way.
[27:02.98]Looks like some sort of generator for the machine.
[27:06.44]Strange green crystal to warm and exhibit an unusual glow.
[27:08.99]Let's go.
[27:13.15]Your brain doesn't move.
[27:14.65]I mean, I guess your lungs can sort of move, right?
[27:25.52]Oops.
[27:26.06]This guy just stores crystals down here.
[27:30.84]I have a magic crystal.
[27:32.20]What am I supposed to do with it?
[27:34.22]Right in here?
[27:35.38]I told you this is just like... Yeah.
[27:38.66]This is Half-Life 1.
[27:39.38]Now I just have to push this in there.
[27:48.18]Alright.
[27:51.92]No, I need the other crystal.
[27:52.80]No, I don't.
[27:54.60]Here we go.
[27:59.69]I just need to hold my hand up in the air.
[28:03.67]My hand is attached to my left ear.
[28:09.07]I just have a hand growing out of my shoulder, I guess.
[28:11.46]This is where it starts.
[28:17.34]Here he comes.
[28:17.98]Here comes Cthulhu.
[28:20.86]Holy shit, it actually is Cthulhu.
[28:23.39]Look at him.
[28:24.89]There's two Cthulhus.
[28:27.61]Cthulhu-Doo and Cthulhu-Dum.
[28:33.11]Yeah.
[28:33.75]Cthulhu-Dee and Cthulhu-Dum.
[28:41.68]The Diary of Jack Wallace, February 6th, 1922.
[28:44.72]This is a few years later.
[28:46.82]It's been more than six years since I entered that strange house in Boston.
[28:52.81]Every house is strange in Boston.
[28:54.63]But to me, it was just five months ago.
[28:58.03]Amnesia, The Dark Descent.
[29:00.96]It was a very weird game.
[29:02.32]Probably brought on by acute mental stress.
[29:04.50]It stressed me out like crazy.
[29:07.36]This guy with his flappy mouth ran after me.
[29:09.60]And I hid inside of a bookcase.
[29:10.60]I made a couple of YouTube videos on it.
[29:12.22]They got 2,700 views each!
[29:12.86]So what, is that supposed to be me?
[29:15.08]When my eyes opened and I spoke, my colleagues recoiled in fear.
[29:37.47]There was something unnatural in my voice and blank gaze.
[29:42.99]They committed me to the asylum, where I was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia.
[29:50.37]As it became clear that I presented no danger to either myself or others, I was released from the asylum's care.
[29:58.21]I have learned little of my activities in the six years that followed.
[30:02.35]Yeah, I got implanted like a brain plug.
[30:03.47]The accounts I've been able to piece together show much of my time was spent in travel and studying.
[30:10.30]I maintained a fanatical infatuation with the occult, delving deep into volumes concerning witch cults and dark legends.
[30:18.80]You get the first gun five hours into the game.
[30:23.55]When I reawakened five months ago,
[30:26.49]Exactly six years after entering that house in Boston, no trace was left of what had been a secondary personality.
[30:35.28]I was myself again, or at least what I believed myself to be.
[30:42.78]He's writing all of this, remarkably, on one page.
[30:45.56]He's just writing over each line.
[30:50.38]He's going to the top and writing over it again.
[30:52.02]Alright.
[30:52.32]Is Cthulhu on the phone?
[30:54.68]Jack Walters.
[31:10.08]Hello, Mr. Walters.
[31:11.42]My name's Arthur Anderson.
[31:13.48]I need your help finding a missing person.
[31:16.77]Okay.
[31:17.19]I don't take that kind of job.
[31:19.29]Did you get my package?
[31:21.39]Um, hold on.
[31:27.15]What?
[31:30.35]Hey, did you get my package?
[31:31.75]I don't know.
[31:32.21]Let me smoke my cigarette first.
[31:35.69]Is it in the trash?
[31:36.41]Yeah.
[31:37.93]Arthur, I threw it in the trash.
[31:41.00]There's one dollar in here.
[31:42.44]Cool, like eight bucks?
[31:43.78]What exactly do you want from me, Mr. Anderson?
[31:48.17]It's one of my store managers, you see.
[31:50.01]Brian's his name.
[31:51.77]Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[31:52.81]This is 1922.
[31:53.29]He disappeared recently from the First National Grocery Store in Innsmouth.
[31:58.03]Like eight dollars in 1922 is $6,000 now.
[32:00.19]It's a small fishing town on the coast, not far from Arkham.
[32:07.58]I'd like to see you in person before you leave.
[32:10.49]Hold on there a minute.
[32:11.57]I didn't agree to take this... What the hell?
[32:15.49]I'll be here all day anyway.
[32:16.95]Hold on a minute there.
[32:19.88]I didn't agree to take this... Okay.
[32:21.16]This game was $10,000 back in 1922.
[32:29.61]It's true.
[32:35.48]That's true.
[32:35.88]Like, Call of Cthulhu back in 1922 would have been like $4,000 or $5,000 with deflation.
[32:45.44]You know, with like deflation, Tom Brady never would have won that fucking Super Bowl.
[32:50.84]You know what I'm saying?
[32:53.02]Like, okay, sure.
[32:53.82]Tom Brady, best quarterback in the fucking NFL to ever live.
[32:56.63]Deflating those footballs wasn't for that.
[32:58.75]He would never have won.
[33:00.37]Un-fucking-believable.
[33:01.23]You know what I'm saying?
[33:04.83]What are we doing?
[33:08.19]I probably should read this.
[33:13.61]I have a new client, Mr. Arthur Anderson, the regional manager of the First National Grocery Store.
[33:17.33]Is this a guy at like a grocery store?
[33:20.15]That's not that menacing of a title.
[33:23.50]I have a new client, Mr. Arthur Anderson, a secret agent.
[33:26.76]No, no, the regional manager of the First National Grocery Store.
[33:31.25]Okay.
[33:32.01]It appears that the first national grocery in Innsmouth was recently burglarized and its manager, one Brian Burnham, is missing.
[33:39.58]From what I have been able to gather, Burnham is something of a young rogue.
[33:43.93]Friend of the family, Mr. Anderson, gave him the job as a favor.
[33:47.23]Burnham is looking like the prime suspect for the robbery, but there are a few things that don't add up, not to Anderson and not to me.
[33:54.57]For instance, why would Burnham force an entry into the store when he had a full set of keys, free access to the cash register, and the combination to the back office safe?
[34:05.02]To misdirect any investigation?
[34:06.76]If that was his plan, why did he disappear?
[34:09.71]Following my conversation with Mr. Anderson, I found out what I could about the ancient town of... I didn't do this yet, by the way.
[34:15.77]For generations, the crumbling seaport and its people have been shunned by neighboring communities.
[34:21.69]Outsiders are unwelcome there, and there are superstitious tales of a strange element in the town's oldest families.
[34:27.38]They speak of going to the grocery store and going to the deli counter and asking for a half a pound of American cheese, and the person that's behind the deli counter slices it way too thick, and you're too much of a, you don't want to, no confrontation to tell them that it's too thick, so you end up with way too thick slices of cheese, and it ruins the rest of your sandwiches for the rest of the week.
[34:51.31]And after making a brief visit to the Innsmouth, my client came away distrustful of the local authorities.
[34:58.97]He isn't buying their line that Burnham robbed the place and wants to know what happened to him.
[35:03.53]Only one bus goes to Innsmouth and tomorrow afternoon I'll be on it.
[35:06.28]Feels good, man.
[35:07.20]Feels good, man.
[35:08.12]To have a purpose after five months trying to break through my amnesia.
[35:12.20]I also feel a little apprehensive.
[35:13.50]Maybe it's the wild stories about the town or maybe it's just because I haven't had a case in so long.
[35:18.76]Okay.
[35:21.09]Just slice it thin with a knife.
[35:22.39]What?
[35:22.99]That's not how it works.
[35:28.54]A visit to the old town.
[35:29.68]I do not expect the... No such thing as too thick.
[35:37.79]Yes, there is.
[35:42.58]Cheese, I'm talking about.
[35:43.68]Cheese!
[35:44.50]Ooh, open world, here we go!
[35:46.20]Huh?
[35:46.52]This guy just had Novocaine at the dentist.
[35:48.94]Okay.
[36:16.11]Alright, can you stop the bus please?
[36:22.42]I would like to get off.
[36:24.54]And by the way, wooden bus.
[36:28.02]How is this driving?
[36:28.98]It's just a bus made out of wood.
[36:30.14]This is like a log cabin on wheels.
[36:33.60]This whole bus is wood.
[36:39.25]Where's the engine?
[36:48.63]Where's the engine?
[36:52.96]B... What was that?
[36:53.52]B207BM?
[36:55.04]That's gonna be a safe password.
[36:56.12]I'm gonna have to open a safe with that, but... Okay, he's already out.
[36:59.08]Look at this bus!
[37:00.82]Where's your engine?
[37:01.78]Don't believe it.
[37:02.32]That's a pretty good nose wipe.
[37:11.01]I don't know nothing about that.
[37:12.93]Oh, well, you see, I'm looking for a young lad called Brian Burnham.
[37:16.71]I'm a friend of the family.
[37:18.24]He worked in the store.
[37:19.58]Okay.
[37:19.94]Don't know who you're talking about, fella.
[37:22.58]Okay, well, nobody knows.
[37:23.68]This is going to be a Texas Chainsaw Massacre where the whole town is in on it.
[37:27.24]Chit-chatting to him is going to get me no place fast.
[37:29.94]Every one of these guys is all possessed by Cthulhu, and they're all going to... It's going to be... Palpatine's going to say, Order 66, and these guys are all going to snap.
[37:39.37]They was there, everybody the whole time.
[37:41.15]I'm looking for Brian Burnham.
[37:42.99]Dad, help you.
[37:44.01]Listen to all their voices.
[37:44.99]These guys are all like frogs.
[37:47.89]Do you know the Burnham lad?
[37:49.57]He worked in the First National.
[37:51.51]Cam rightly says I know him.
[37:53.99]I wonder if these guys are evil.
[37:56.87]I don't know who he is.
[37:58.15]I have no idea.
[38:02.46]Do you know the Burnham lad?
[38:04.62]Cam rightly says I know him.
[38:07.84]Well, okay.
[38:09.44]Let's go to the grocery store and find this guy.
[38:11.56]Well, this is a cop.
[38:12.48]Let's see if this cop has an evil voice.
[38:14.64]Excuse me, Constable.
[38:16.08]Jack Walters.
[38:18.23]Robes.
[38:19.35]Alien robes.
[38:20.77]What do you want?
[38:22.01]Could you help out a stranger to this fine port?
[38:24.93]Are you being funny?
[38:27.05]No.
[38:27.95]Not at all.
[38:29.17]I'm after directions to the First National.
[38:31.60]I hear they have a store in town.
[38:34.03]Uh, okay.
[38:34.50]Dock Street, South Street.
[38:35.72]Northwest Fall Street.
[38:36.48]Federal Street.
[38:37.72]Alright.
[38:38.30]Um...
[38:55.52]There's the hotel.
[38:57.64]The place can't f-f-f-for all- why would I?
[39:01.40]It's right here!
[39:02.08]Why would I need to ask around?
[39:05.44]Excuse me, do you know where the First National Grocery Store is?
[39:08.60]The town is like not even a tenth of a mile long and I could have just looked around for five seconds.
[39:13.30]This town's deserted.
[39:14.62]Where is everybody?
[39:16.16]If you don't like it, just turn around and leave.
[39:20.14]Mm-hmm.
[39:21.61]Sure.
[39:22.33]Well, you came out of nowhere.
[39:24.81]You can't come down here.
[39:27.35]You can't come down here.
[39:31.39]You're under arrest.
[39:32.31]You clearly don't want me snooping around.
[39:34.75]I need to be more careful.
[39:36.52]Then don't you dare go in the back door.
[39:39.00]I won't be able to see you.
[40:01.18]Shit.
[40:04.52]Never mind.
[40:06.71]Why do they all sound like RPG monsters?
[40:08.35]Because they all are RPG monsters.
[40:12.81]No front door access.
[40:16.34]Police line do not cross, so... Where is everybody?
[40:19.30]It's very quiet.
[40:20.96]It's getting late, outsider.
[40:22.76]Folks who know what's good for them are safely bolted in their homes by now.
[40:30.18]Okay.
[40:30.74]Um, so, I need to, like... These are the offices of a local newspaper.
[40:36.06]The Innsmouth Courier.
[40:37.08]There has to be, like, a way to get in there from around the... Like, can I, like, sneak?
[40:41.80]It won't budge.
[40:43.46]Maybe I have to, like, crouch by.
[40:53.26]No, no, come on.
[40:55.25]Don't you do it.
[41:00.75]Fucking idiot.
[41:02.49]It won't budge.
[41:03.45]Oh shit.
[41:07.44]Be cautious when sneaking past enemies.
[41:08.82]To avoid detection, keep in cover wherever possible.
[41:11.60]Stick to the shadows, move slowly and keep as low as possible.
[41:15.10]Is this a shadow?
[41:15.74]Does this count as a shadow?
[41:22.56]I think it does.
[41:23.42]I'm right in the corner here where there's no light.
[41:25.26]What if I just don't move?
[41:31.66]Where the hell is this guy?
[41:38.50]He's going to end up coming back up, right?
[41:44.50]There you go!
[41:51.27]Ah, whatever.
[41:51.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:53.36]Damn.
[41:54.76]I need to be more careful.
[42:06.77]Yeah.
[42:19.68]Get over here.
[42:22.85]Get over here.
[42:23.31]Come on.
[42:24.13]Quit snooping around, you kids.
[42:27.43]Quit snooping around and let's just have a little... While we wait, let's just get a little... Just gotta pee a little bit.
[42:42.08]Just a little bit before we get going here.
[42:44.62]There he is.
[42:47.96]And I am ready to go.
[42:53.45]Now, stand up!
[42:58.19]Can I open this?
[42:59.05]Can I just keep the- Can I unlock this?
[43:01.41]Of course not.
[43:06.72]Is there a save- Thank god there's a save point.
[43:08.28]Do you know how far back that was?
[43:09.60]That was a long ways away.
[43:19.87]Now we can sneak into the grocery store.
[43:24.36]and find the fucked up shit they're doing in here.
[43:28.86]The door's bolted shut.
[43:30.10]Of course it is.
[43:32.38]Can I syringe it open?
[43:34.14]The door's bolted shut.
[43:35.34]I can't wait to see the insane, scary thing.
[43:38.80]Nothing of interest.
[43:40.58]The police security guard's gonna walk over and be like... The window's smashed.
[43:46.65]I can see what looks like an old dark room.
[43:49.21]It's time to sacrifice the bar to the dark lord.
[43:58.28]Keep going this way.
[44:07.49]Fucking cheese slices.
[44:09.49]They're way too thick.
[44:11.87]You need thin cheese slices.
[44:13.51]Cheese is not that good for you guys.
[44:15.81]Trust me.
[44:18.32]Where is he?
[44:21.48]It's unlocked.
[44:22.36]There we go.
[44:25.64]If you put, like, a small, like, tenth of an inch cheese slice on the sandwich, you can't even tell it's there.
[44:33.86]America's obsession with cheese is fucking crazy.
[44:37.26]If you have a cheese, if you have, like, a fucking ham and cheese sandwich, you got ham, you got lettuce, you got tomato, you got mayo on there, a little bit of mustard, you can't even taste the cheese.
[44:45.98]The cheese is just like a piece of fiber that just sits there, and it's like 140 calories.
[44:49.83]Why not put the cheese, America?
[44:51.87]Dial it back.
[44:55.27]I've eaten sandwiches that had cheese on them and not cheese and they both taste exactly the same It's just it's just a layer of jello that gives you extra calories.
[45:02.87]It's fucking come on These shelves look light enough to push how do I push things again fuck you you fucking I'm on a decent snoop around I'd better do something to block that door I
[45:25.24]I think he was in the way.
[45:26.22]Yeah, he was in the way.
[45:29.18]Oh my lord.
[45:30.46]Okay, so block the door.
[45:55.86]That was terrifying.
[45:58.26]It's unlocked.
[45:59.71]Yeah, you can move things.
[46:05.53]Scratch marks on the floor!
[46:06.61]Alright, now close it so he can't get in here.
[46:14.67]That's a really, really ugly sound.
[46:21.95]Alright, so he can no longer get in here, right?
[46:28.49]I hope not.
[46:29.51]Watch him like squeeze through the crack and jump scare us again.
[46:32.09]Okay.
[46:33.57]Documents.
[46:34.55]There's probably another police officer lying around somewhere.
[46:36.63]Nice.
[46:56.56]Register the tills empty.
[46:59.02]Oh Let's get some medical supplies.
[47:04.36]Yeah, okay Anything else of interest this is sold here Booze there's a bottle of bootleg rum and a wooden handle.
[47:17.14]What is bootleg rum a typewriter?
[47:19.92]invoices and receipt an empty safe the drawer is empty a

[47:27.71]Bathtub whiskey?
[47:29.61]What the hell was that?
[47:31.55]Wait, what's going on?
[47:33.79]Oh, he's smashing the thing.
[47:36.99]He's smashing open the door.
[47:38.03]Which way do I?
[47:38.47]Oh God.
[47:38.61]Did he get in?
[47:38.95]I gotta leave.
[47:39.51]Go!
[47:55.96]Wait, this is the fucking wrong?
[47:58.78]Why?
[48:04.24]The same fucking guy.
[48:07.76]God damn it.
[48:12.28]The same guy.
[48:13.34]What's wrong with me?
[48:16.14]Stop it.
[48:18.36]I wish I could save.
[48:24.16]I'm not an idiot.
[48:25.48]I'm not an idiot.
[48:26.76]Don't say that.
[48:27.48]I'm not an idiot Wait, what?
[48:30.82]I have to get caught?
[48:39.28]Hide in the barrels?
[48:43.00]Hey make sure but you know you when you put you know in science class when like that weird creepy guy comes in from like a an assembly
[48:51.29]And he has that big ball that you put your hand on and it makes your hair stand on its end.
[48:56.59]It's like the static electricity balls.
[49:00.27]That's what that sounds like.
[49:03.17]Okay, don't go back this way, you dumb fucking dummy.
[49:06.06]Okay, grab this.
[49:13.60]Here he comes.
[49:14.42]Which one of these doors opens?
[49:15.42]This one won't budge.
[49:16.46]This one will open, right?
[49:23.31]No, I guess I just have to hide.
[49:26.41]I'm so confused.
[49:27.79]Okay.
[49:27.91]So I gotta hide.
[49:28.51]We're gonna hide over here.
[49:30.13]Right.
[49:30.41]Oh wait, what's this?
[49:31.18]Oh shit.
[49:31.34]Get it open!
[49:52.55]Get it up in Mr. Spaghetti Arms.
[49:53.89]Go on.
[49:56.51]We don't need a cutscene this long.
[49:57.89]We don't need a cutscene this long.
[49:58.97]Go.
[50:00.39]What the f- Was that supposed to happen?
[50:12.64]Okay, that was scripted.
[50:30.19]Um, I don't think I'm gonna rot.
[50:33.09]There's plenty of food down here.
[50:34.11]There's a bunch of bags of flour.
[50:37.07]There's a bunch of pizzas down here.
[50:39.23]There's tonic down here.
[50:40.19]There's soda.
[50:40.55]There's cocoa.
[50:43.31]There's hot wings.
[50:44.97]Look at this.
[50:45.41]Wings.
[50:47.02]You can rot down here.
[50:47.92]Dude, there's like enough food to survive for like three years.
[50:54.04]Start a new life down here, man.
[50:55.38]Oh, what?
[50:55.64]Easy.
[51:08.25]Huh?
[51:10.48]Alright.
[51:11.20]I wasn't trying to do that.
[51:14.04]So, that's where we need to go.
[51:16.96]You need to toss the ladder over into the brick wall to have it explode.
[51:22.47]Hey, kids!
[51:23.71]Isn't it funny how Cynthia's hair is standing on end?
[51:26.61]Oh, no.
[51:47.19]Okay, we've waited.
[51:48.05]That's science for you!
[52:00.20]You see, into her follicles, electricity is peering into them.
[52:04.38]And it's making her hair lighter than air.
[52:13.58]Without a care in the world!
[52:15.10]And then they start like... He starts singing.
[52:19.10]The whole class stands up and starts clapping.
[52:21.30]Watch out for ammo pickups.
[52:25.87]Ammo will always carry across to the next chapter.
[52:29.25]But the quantity you can carry for each weapon is capped.
[52:32.24]The interface shows the total rounds you're carrying, including those in the gun.
[52:34.88]Now where's the gun?
[52:40.08]The old printing press appears to have been... Nothing of interest.
[52:43.83]Is that moving?
[52:44.33]Am I okay?
[52:47.13]Yeah, I'm fine.
[52:48.51]General notices.
[52:50.17]They're all dated 1846.
[52:50.87]I had traumatic experiences during school?
[52:57.07]What?
[53:00.01]No, I'm talking about like... Like a fucking Alice in Wonderland thing.
[53:05.73]Oh boy.
[53:06.81]Holy shit!
[53:10.94]Should I take the brushes?
[53:12.28]Should I investigate the body?
[53:15.72]Should I give a little phone call?
[53:16.52]I don't think that's the reaction you would actually have.
[53:21.28]Yeah, it's broad.
[53:22.04]You'd think you'd be a little bit more scared at this.
[53:41.61]She's going to come after me, isn't she?
[53:42.99]I feel like she is.
[53:44.23]Alright.
[53:47.49]Anything else I can grab here?
[53:50.14]I got a clip.
[53:53.32]The current time is 27 o'clock.
[53:59.38]Whatever that means.
[54:02.99]What about down here?
[54:04.39]Did I miss anything else?
[54:08.91]No.
[54:09.47]There's nothing else I have to do in here.
[54:15.04]It won't budge.
[54:16.58]Turning press.
[54:17.56]What about this door?
[54:18.68]Not great.
[54:19.14]That lady is gonna come off the noose and come get me.
[54:23.71]It's so obvious.
[54:43.16]So bolt this fucking door so that doesn't happen to me.
[54:45.54]Now I'm just back out here.
[55:12.74]It won't open.
[55:15.28]Well, we're gonna save.
[55:19.02]I'm gonna save, I'm gonna save.
[55:22.48]Where's the save point?
[55:23.65]There's a guy here.
[55:24.21]Is this a guy?
[55:24.65]Is this a bad guy?
[55:26.37]He's right in front of the save point.
[55:30.17]Oh shit.
[55:30.47]Sneak in front of this guy?
[55:33.28]You can't sneak.
[55:35.90]Ooh.
[55:53.50]Seen the latest press from Arkham?
[55:55.72]Your boy's been quite busy.
[55:57.68]How did he get in?
[55:58.26]That's true.
[56:00.34]What about you, Mackie?
[56:01.72]You're obviously not a local.
[56:03.30]What's your business in town?
[56:06.42]True enough, Jack.
[56:08.02]Nothing too exciting, I'm sorry to say.
[56:10.72]I'm a government factory inspector.
[56:13.59]They posted me in this rotten hole to check over the old Marsh refinery.
[56:18.27]Speaking of which, I've got an appointment with the manager, Jacob Marsh.
[56:23.30]Okay, maybe I'll catch you later.
[56:26.14]What do you add to the story?
[56:27.24]Get the fuck out of here.
[56:28.54]That's the first friendly face I've seen in this damn town.
[56:31.46]But I've been in this business long enough to know he's hiding something.
[56:34.74]He must be, he must be Batman.
[56:45.71]It won't open.
[56:47.77]So what do I, now what?
[56:53.24]What did I get from this that was so important that I needed to get?
[56:55.72]Do I have to give the whiskey to somebody?
[57:03.52]We're just walking around.
[57:06.10]Being stalked by the gargoyle.
[57:07.76]He's going to swoop down.
[57:09.62]Cthulhu's out here on the fucking perch.
[57:12.02]I'm looking for Brian Burnham.
[57:22.64]Okay.
[57:24.34]Well, where is he?
[57:26.04]Is he just sitting up there?
[57:26.98]Okay, what about the journal?
[57:37.77]Very straightforward case.
[57:51.99]Mm-hmm.
[57:58.06]Diary of Brian Burnham.
[58:00.74]Shouldn't be stuck in this miserable excuse for a town.
[58:02.50]I can see why nobody comes here, that's for sure.
[58:04.28]Another slow day at the store.
[58:06.95]First I thought people were staying away because First National isn't local, but I haven't seen anyone go into any of the other stores either.
[58:13.77]Come to that, I haven't seen the other stores open for business.
[58:16.29]This place is deader than dead.
[58:18.86]Still, it wouldn't be long before I'm out of here.
[58:21.10]Before we're both out of here.
[58:23.55]She's the one good thing about Innsmouth.
[58:25.35]We'll bust open Old Man Waits Safe.
[58:28.23]Take a car and then it's New York City.
[58:30.69]Bright lights, nightlife, everything.
[58:32.15]I'll show her all of it.
[58:34.73]We need to go to the guy whose thing is capitalized.
[58:38.93]Old Man Waits Safe.
[58:43.18]Wherever that is.
[58:43.70]Okay.
[58:50.60]The Boston Globe.
[58:51.86]I know that paper.
[58:52.60]What about this?
[59:01.69]Nothing.
[59:03.13]Diary.
[59:04.11]Whatever.
[59:04.45]Alright.
[59:06.71]Where's Old Man Waite?
[59:07.51]Old Man Waite.
[59:14.78]Variety store.
[59:22.02]It's a variety store, and it's closed.
[59:24.64]Yes, it is.
[59:29.47]Not for us sneaky guys, though.
[59:31.09]It's locked.
[59:31.67]It's locked.
[59:32.05]Oh, come on.
[59:32.95]It must lead to the back of a variety store.
[59:38.34]We need to break into somebody's safe.
[59:42.46]I need to go into the Verizon store.
[59:49.04]Esoteric order of the dragon.
[59:53.70]Do you know the Burnham lad?
[59:55.38]He worked here and rightly says I know him.
[60:00.74]So we gotta find a guy that's safe, but where the fuck is that?
[60:02.96]It appears to be shut down.
[60:09.12]What's gonna happen here?
[60:11.68]Nothing.
[60:11.98]This is a weird door.
[60:14.10]It won't budge.
[60:16.08]Am I playing the fixed version?
[60:17.28]I am currently playing the fixed version, yes.
[60:20.44]What in here?
[60:22.16]Have I gone in here?
[60:25.31]There's a save point.
[60:27.19]A dusty assortment of old books.
[60:31.41]Well, let's save it.
[60:37.97]Everything is locked to the video game.
[60:41.72]It's locked.
[60:43.50]I need a key.
[60:44.92]It won't open.
[60:45.62]Okay, well there's... It won't budge.
[60:50.70]Here's this guy.
[60:52.16]Let's get some info!
[60:53.22]Evening.
[60:54.16]Hi.
[60:55.09]The name's Jack Walters.
[60:56.53]I'm just visiting.
[60:58.29]You don't say, sir.
[61:00.11]Gilman.
[61:01.25]Charlie Gilman.
[61:02.19]I like his name.
[61:02.90]I run this here hotel of an evening.
[61:05.66]You got any rooms?
[61:07.86]I'd not rightly know that for sure.
[61:10.32]It's an oddly worded sentence.
[61:12.36]Them's from out of town can leave a horrid mess.
[61:20.05]Hello, Gilman.
[61:21.74]What do you want now?
[61:22.90]I want to be able to... There's a strange thing about that Burnham lad.
[61:27.02]Burnham?
[61:28.10]Kent rightly says I know what you're talking about.
[61:30.74]Kent rightly says I know.
[61:32.28]It was all over the Arkham Press.
[61:34.28]Must have been a bit of a local scandal.
[61:37.38]Them's matters for the police, stranger.
[61:39.34]I like his Pisces type.
[61:40.42]It's not a town for rumoring and talking.
[61:43.98]Alright, so we have to go to the old man, old man waits.
[61:46.50]How do I fucking piano wire this guy and take his skeleton key?
[61:49.58]Of course it won't.
[61:50.24]None of this shit?
[61:51.54]Oh, come on.
[62:09.77]I already got the safe?
[62:11.95]Well, what do I need to do now?
[62:15.91]I took the bottle of rum.
[62:17.45]I probably have to give this to somebody.
[62:25.06]Can I give him this booze?
[62:28.86]How's business?
[62:30.46]Can't you see I'm busy?
[62:32.38]Stop bothering me while you're talking.
[62:34.28]OK.
[62:34.84]Sorry.
[62:35.26]Hi.
[62:37.26]Can I sneak underneath his legs here?
[62:39.48]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[62:42.50]Yeah, look at this.
[62:43.62]There's a key right there.
[62:44.38]Can you tell me I can't fit underneath this?
[62:49.62]That's horseshit.
[62:50.26]Can I jump over here?
[62:52.99]No, something has to happen.
[62:54.01]He needs to be... He needs to be distracted.
[63:02.93]Oh, shit.
[63:03.71]It's like...
[63:05.85]I'm currently breaking the game.
[63:10.65]Okay, well, we tried.
[63:12.77]It won't budge.
[63:17.53]It won't open.
[63:18.13]Can't say I didn't try the hotel.
[63:26.65]I'm looking for a young lad called Brian Burnham.
[63:29.48]He worked in the First National.
[63:31.16]I'm a friend of the family.
[63:33.17]I ain't gonna go burn them.
[63:34.93]What about if I give you some alcohol?
[63:37.27]Right.
[63:44.75]Bullet fudge.
[63:46.93]Um, alright.
[63:47.87]I don't think I missed anything in the grocery store.
[63:52.21]Maybe I did.
[63:53.63]Can't go to the variety store.
[63:55.95]That won't open.
[63:57.95]Can't go over here.
[64:04.81]Alright, is there anybody else to talk to?
[64:06.47]Talk to the bum?
[64:13.86]What do you mean, bum?
[64:16.68]Down here?
[64:21.58]In one of the back alleys?
[64:28.02]I guess we didn't go back here, you're right.
[64:32.39]It's all about that exploration.
[64:37.23]What about you?
[64:38.73]I'm looking for Brian Brown.
[64:39.91]Can't help ya.
[64:42.96]It won't open.
[64:44.20]Can't help ya.
[64:46.78]Ooh, guy digging some trash.
[64:48.22]This town's deserted.
[64:49.50]Where is everybody?
[64:51.06]Stop pestering me, stranger.
[64:56.65]Come on.
[64:57.53]Where is everybody?
[64:58.79]It's very quiet.
[65:00.37]Just leave me be, stranger.
[65:01.25]The normal looking folk in this town are terrified of something.
[65:04.03]It just won't talk to me.
[65:05.37]It won't budge.
[65:07.42]This is just like a normal Boston town.
[65:11.01]People swearing at you, people yelling at you, everyone telling you to get the fuck out of their way.
[65:15.57]What about down here?
[65:19.09]Get out of my way.
[65:21.66]I got a place to be.
[65:22.74]You're a fucking idiot.
[65:27.90]Shut up and get out of my way.
[65:29.62]Is it a gas station?
[65:32.46]What's the only thing we have in Boston?
[65:35.51]Phone store, gas station, sub shop, and a bank.
[65:42.43]Repeat that over 500 different brands.
[65:46.37]That's all we got here.
[65:49.22]You want a Verizon store?
[65:50.82]You want a T-Mobile store?
[65:52.76]You want a Sprint store?
[65:54.50]You want three Sprint stores?
[65:55.88]Do you want a gas station?
[65:58.68]A device that pumps highly compressed air.
[66:00.78]Jerry subs.
[66:02.32]Dan subs.
[66:05.02]Anthony's pizza.
[66:06.56]Big pizza.
[66:08.73]Sandwiches and subs and shops.
[66:12.77]Add a TD Bank.
[66:14.33]Bank of America.
[66:15.67]Bank of America.
[66:17.19]TD Bank.
[66:18.93]Sovereign Bank.
[66:20.95]Santander Bank.
[66:26.38]That's all there is.
[66:27.28]It's the whole city.
[66:28.82]It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss.
[66:31.40]Miss will do for now.
[66:33.16]Welcome to Innsmouth, Mr. Walters.
[66:35.83]Thanks, I think.
[66:38.09]Take my advice.
[66:39.35]Do what you must and then leave.
[66:41.19]Tonight, this port does not cater well to visitors.
[66:46.31]Big peaks of bank gas and subs.
[66:48.27]Very well, Mr. Walters.
[66:55.82]Alright, do you want a drink?
[66:57.82]Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention a liquor store.
[67:00.00]This doll seems more open than some folks around these parts, but she isn't going to talk to me right now.
[67:07.22]And convenience store.
[67:09.98]It's shut.
[67:10.52]Hello, Mackie.
[67:15.42]Here's this guy.
[67:15.88]Jack, swell to see you again.
[67:18.76]Any leads on the Burnham case?
[67:21.18]Nah.
[67:21.56]Nope.
[67:22.22]Did you know the lad at all?
[67:24.47]Duncan Donuts?
[67:25.17]Dude, honestly, Duncan Donuts?
[67:26.55]I would have mentioned Duncan Donuts.
[67:27.97]But there's so many of them that they're like grass.
[67:54.61]This Mackie character knows plenty, but I don't think grilling him for scraps of information is gonna crack this case.
[68:01.67]Duncan.
[68:03.07]Oh yeah, America runs on Duncan.
[68:08.09]It won't budge.
[68:11.03]What do you know about the break-in at the Variety Store?
[68:14.09]Only what was in the press.
[68:16.15]You should speak to Thomas Waite.
[68:18.03]He owns the joint.
[68:19.01]I would love to.
[68:19.72]Where's his place?
[68:21.46]I think the Waite's house is over on Dock Street.
[68:23.52]Dock Street.
[68:24.24]Near the back of the pool house.
[68:25.78]Aha, okay.
[68:26.70]Thanks.
[68:27.90]Though I warn you, it's Miss Driven Old Waite's a bit crazy.
[68:32.45]He doesn't talk a lot of sense.
[68:34.79]That's my sort of fella.
[68:36.19]He sounds just perfect.
[68:37.91]Hey, do you like the New England Patriots?
[68:42.22]I do.
[68:43.88]Well, then you're gonna love Duncan.
[68:47.92]It even says...
[68:50.30]On the fucking coffee cup.
[68:53.38]Five-time champions.
[68:58.24]Have you ever heard of the Patriots?
[68:59.98]They won the fucking Super Bowl that time a while ago.
[69:04.34]Gronk.
[69:06.00]You see how big his hands are?
[69:09.10]He can catch any ball anybody ever throws.
[69:13.22]Hope he doesn't get fucking injured.
[69:17.02]I run on Dunkin'.
[69:18.18]When I go through the drive-thru, Gronk is there holding a bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel as a giant cardboard cutout.
[69:26.81]You think that's interesting?
[69:35.03]Alright, we're gonna go down Duck Street.
[69:42.78]This is not Dock Street.
[69:43.64]This is Town Square.
[69:44.46]Dock Street was like this way, right?
[69:49.64]What am I on about?
[69:50.48]I'm being from Boston.
[69:52.34]That's like what you do.
[69:56.02]Dude.
[69:57.04]I heard... I heard that they were trading this guy.
[70:03.70]Fuck.
[70:04.89]Alright, well what the hell?
[70:05.85]I...
[70:12.51]Wait, can I get by him?
[70:16.70]So how do I get to Dock Street if Dock Street is blocked?
[70:19.02]You should go visit Dock Street, except there's a guy with a fucking paddle there waiting for you.
[70:28.27]Uh-huh, well, okay.
[70:44.67]Dark street, more like blocked street.
[70:50.32]Fuck.
[70:53.16]What's in here?
[70:54.02]Nothing.
[70:55.08]This won't open either.
[71:05.49]What about over here?
[71:06.67]This reminds me of the Ted Williams tunnel.
[71:14.54]Fucking crazy.
[71:15.86]You know how much traffic comes through here?
[71:18.14]It's a miracle that we can even get two cars in there.
[71:21.18]It won't budge.
[71:29.53]Whoa!
[71:34.73]If your pee comes out like that, you gotta see a doctor.
[71:38.29]That's the cone setting on a hose.
[71:42.50]When the driving rain of the hurricane puts the lights of the lighthouse out.
[71:49.95]And the growling thunder sounds its gong, and the world will swallow our food.
[71:56.01]I agree.
[71:56.77]I think we should trade Gronkh.
[71:58.69]Do you think that's a valiant shrink?
[72:02.71]Who's that there?
[72:03.79]I got the whiskey for this guy.
[72:05.21]Spare a few pennies, young mister.
[72:07.99]I can give you something for your generosity.
[72:10.89]We can get a... Who are you?
[72:13.03]Zadok.
[72:13.63]Progression.
[72:14.11]Let that be my name.
[72:15.71]Though too few years in now.
[72:18.05]Zadok Khaled.
[72:19.88]Do you know a Brian Burnham?
[72:21.44]I don't know.
[72:23.26]Was he on the Bruins?
[72:25.81]If he isn't, I don't know.
[72:27.85]Killed, I reckon.
[72:30.19]Killed?
[72:31.17]What makes you think that?
[72:33.01]Them's from out of town running a store.
[72:36.72]Taking business from the Order of Dagon.
[72:39.52]Okay, the Order of Dagon.
[72:40.66]They'd not accept that.
[72:42.80]What else can you tell me about this port?
[72:45.89]I already got it.
[72:47.34]Mm-hmm.
[72:47.50]There you are.
[72:48.22]Let's see how many gulps he does.
[72:49.92]I'm gonna say four.
[72:51.34]One, two, ow.
[72:52.20]He's gonna puke.
[73:18.13]I thought he was... Alright, he just picked his ass and gave us something.
[73:23.02]Whatever that is.
[73:23.48]It's probably key to the variety store.
[73:28.92]Zadok.
[73:29.18]I'm really glad there are subtitles, because I would not know a single word this guy is saying.
[73:56.66]So what did he give me?
[73:57.88]Didn't the Christian folk of Innsmouth object to such blasphemy?
[74:01.22]Why would you talk to this guy like this?
[74:02.49]They did.
[74:03.37]It were around 46 that many folks in town were done with Obed and his ways.
[74:11.45]And all that wild preachin' and two-minute missin', you see.
[74:17.04]Ahem.
[74:18.06]A party of good folk followed Captain Obed's crowd out to the region.
[74:23.50]Just for fire.
[74:25.08]Next day, Obed and the bloody of his father's way in jail.
[74:30.67]And for weeks all were crying, till that artful night of 46.
[74:37.29]This guy better get scooped up.
[74:41.77]By a winged creature.
[74:46.29]Scoop him up.
[74:46.79]Somebody just swing down and grab him.
[74:48.74]It's gonna happen.
[74:59.08]Scooped him up.
[75:00.75]Talk about like a fucking bird that swings down and just like... She's gone.
[75:08.87]Must be like really... I would be pretty good at that if you like, you know, like three, two, one.
[75:15.06]Don't do this.
[75:29.31]I feel like that'd be pretty good.
[75:31.29]Five gold.
[75:31.61]What the hell are these oaths?
[75:52.53]He's giving me a key to the town poorhouse.
[75:53.93]It could come in handy.
[75:54.47]Thank you for the key.
[75:56.38]Thank you for the key.
[75:58.62]Now leave me be.
[76:00.24]Leave me be.
[76:18.84]Bah!
[76:20.26]Now why did I talk to him again?
[76:22.16]Why did I fuckin' pick him again?
[76:26.30]Leave BB.
[76:26.76]Leave BB.
[76:27.34]...in the South Seas, led by a savage.
[76:30.10]Chief went by the name of Walakea.
[76:34.14]And his tribe never went without food.
[76:45.44]For that, all the fish they could catch, all Obed learned from his wallachia, that these things on this Earth, as most folks never heard about, seems these Kanukis was worshipped in undersea gods, with heaps of human sacrifices, and other even things, but they was getting all kinds of favors in return.
[77:10.75]I shouldn't have clicked him again.
[77:11.97]I clicked him.
[77:12.29]Why did I click on him?
[77:12.87]I'll tell you when I've had enough.
[77:14.24]Young fella.
[77:14.52]But just answer me this.
[77:26.25]Why did Captain Ovid roll out to the reef of Satan and chant a lot of rites and incantations in the dead of night?
[77:37.30]So loud you could hear him all over the port.
[77:41.32]He cast silent water that evening out of the little sight of the devil.
[77:47.26]Some kind of thing-a-jig drafted out of the wind would give them back while it came.
[77:54.89]My ice cream bar.
[77:57.93]Steamy.
[77:59.21]This makes it better to listen to.
[78:18.11]That was perfect.
[78:20.30]He's not even saying words.
[78:23.52]This is so awful.
[78:24.80]DP!
[78:24.92]I'm going to kill you!
[78:26.14]He just took a bow.
[78:27.36]Dude, if I had a gun, I would shoot this guy.
[78:31.92]Zadok.
[78:32.24]Zadok.
[78:48.17]I'm sorry.
[78:48.63]I'm sorry.
[78:49.35]I'm sorry.
[78:49.95]I purposely woke him up.
[78:51.17]Okay, we're done.
[78:51.91]What did he give me?
[78:52.51]Key to the town's portals.
[78:54.19]Alright, let's go.
[78:54.81]Zadok.
[78:55.01]Zadok.
[79:18.07]Zadok.
[79:18.25]Zadok.
[79:18.57]Zadok.
[79:18.75]Zadok.
[79:18.89]Oh, here she comes.
[79:19.35]Hide.
[79:19.49]Shadows.
[79:19.69]No.
[79:20.89]No.
[79:20.95]It's Jack.
[79:21.21]Fuck.
[79:21.61]She sticks her tongue out and goes... Like, burn him?
[79:27.60]Fuck.
[79:46.93]And it forks.
[79:48.43]She turns into a snake.
[79:53.69]What?
[79:54.63]Who's Ruth?
[79:57.17]Do I have to do this?
[79:59.69]Is this where, like, the chain splits?
[80:02.44]Yeah, no, we're just doing this.
[80:05.20]No, no, more of this.
[80:06.24]Is she drunk, too?
[80:08.36]There are things that have no business being here.
[80:11.16]Foul, reeking things.
[80:13.85]Strange.
[80:14.99]Trust me.
[80:15.51]I'm good with strange.
[80:18.25]That remains to be seen.
[80:20.05]But I can help you.
[80:22.03]My father discovered this strange sign while studying an old manuscript.
[80:26.64]It seems to ward off the more unusual elements in Innsmouth.
[80:30.88]Whoa.
[80:32.38]Whenever you find one, you can use it to find a moment of sanctuary.
[80:37.16]This is where I get my level up?
[80:37.94]You must leave before we're seen together.
[80:41.25]Okay, so I get to look at this and I get to level up my skill points.
[80:44.60]One in strength.
[80:46.76]One in dex.
[80:49.60]One in constitution.
[80:52.35]One in endurance.
[80:53.99]And one in super speed.
[80:58.21]Oh, it's just a save.
[81:00.97]What?
[81:03.12]Hold on, didn't it- this is just a save mechanic?
[81:09.52]Okay, that was great.
[81:10.54]Cool.
[81:11.08]Fun.
[81:12.74]Let's get to it.
[81:13.34]Let's hop to it.
[81:13.93]Let's get to the video game here.
[81:15.03]Let's get to the runaway from the monster and hide.
[81:18.11]See, I'm being stalked right now.
[81:25.78]Eventually, I'm going to go in the right spot.
[81:28.18]And then the gargoyle is going to drop down.
[81:29.92]It's going to scoop one of these guys up.
[81:41.32]Alright.
[81:42.62]Trash.
[81:43.80]For a really huge bowl of fruity pebbles.
[81:48.02]I haven't figured it out yet.
[81:55.93]You thought this was an RPG?
[81:57.81]No.
[81:59.35]I thought I was going to get skill points.
[82:01.11]Alright.
[82:01.37]Dock Street.
[82:05.21]Here we go.
[82:05.61]This is where I go.
[82:06.35]Sneak by this guy.
[82:07.09]Open the door.
[82:08.36]And we continue the game.
[82:12.56]Alright, here we are.
[82:13.94]It's locked.
[82:15.24]It must lead to the .
[82:16.88]It's the wrong key.
[82:18.04]What?
[82:21.49]Fuck.
[82:21.81]Where's the poor house?
[82:27.19]It's a variety store.
[82:28.57]What?
[82:28.93]It's closed.
[82:30.05]What?
[82:31.91]What?
[82:34.69]In here?
[82:37.21]It won't open.
[82:37.99]What?
[82:51.58]What about in here?
[82:52.06]What?!
[82:52.76]Where's the hotel?
[82:53.28]In here?
[82:53.70]Huh?!
[82:53.98]Huh?!
[82:54.10]Alright, I'm sorry.
[82:54.90]There it is!
[82:57.28]Nice!
[83:23.42]This is where we get scared.
[83:26.60]God, this joke.
[83:27.14]I'm not making any jokes.
[83:30.38]That's not a joke.
[83:31.04]That's me exclaiming something.
[83:37.92]If I see you without tires, I'll report your order.
[83:42.27]Well, that's a death sentence.
[83:46.25]Hey, what's up?
[83:49.09]Excuse me.
[83:50.37]I'm talking to you.
[83:51.31]Okay.
[83:53.91]Well, sorry.
[83:56.43]I just got... I just sentenced you to die.
[84:09.36]It won't budge.
[84:11.02]Notice I didn't do a spoiler there?
[84:13.50]I'm not a spoiler guy.
[84:14.38]I don't tell you spoilers.
[84:17.13]Wait a minute.
[84:18.11]Do you need any help?
[84:20.28]That's kind of creepy.
[84:23.26]It won't open.
[84:23.94]I hereby sentence you to death.
[84:32.06]It won't budge.
[84:36.23]Hey, excuse me.
[84:37.27]You're all out in there.
[84:38.25]It's the entrance to the town poorhouse.
[84:42.45]What's that?
[84:43.05]Nothing?
[84:49.14]Nothing of interest.
[84:50.08]Do I need to be sneaking by these guys?
[84:53.04]Or... It won't open.
[84:54.42]What?
[84:54.78]You know?
[84:58.34]Maybe not.
[85:00.22]This random creepy guy is staring at me.
[85:03.04]Will he finally make himself appear?
[85:05.50]Show yourself.
[85:07.18]Stop this.
[85:08.59]Whoa!
[85:09.21]Jesus Christ!
[85:09.93]It actually... It actually was right there.
[85:14.85]It was real.
[85:16.33]That was really there.
[85:18.46]Did you not see that, dude?
[85:20.16]Did you not see the fucking gremlin that was on the roof?
[85:23.96]What are you looking at there, old timer?
[85:26.24]Nothing.
[85:27.56]I'm just looking.
[85:29.16]What are you doing in old Warren's house, young fella?
[85:31.68]Holy shit.
[85:32.86]I did not expect that.
[85:36.01]I'm trying to find Dock Street.
[85:38.27]It's out back of the house.
[85:40.67]Everything in Innsmouth is rotten and dying.
[85:43.19]It's Halloween.
[85:44.13]Windows boarded up.
[85:45.65]November 1st.
[85:46.11]All sorts of curious barking and crawling around black cellars and attics.
[85:52.13]How would you like to be living in a town like this, fella?
[85:56.94]I've been to more welcoming places.
[85:59.44]I don't think he's been outdoors for years.
[86:01.16]We've talked about this before, but I want to bring it up again.
[86:05.55]Like old men like when guys do when people people voice act old men Like get come on But I hate that shit Just making your normal voice have a little more air in it is not an old person You know I'm talking like this normally Because if I add a little air to all of my sounds I'm old now.
[86:28.86]That's not how you do it.
[86:29.68]That's that's incorrect.
[86:30.66]I
[86:31.59]Just be, have you ever heard an old man that sounded like this?
[86:37.82]You're going to put your fucking sounds here.
[86:39.68]You're going to really get really deeply into your esophagus and find out, you know, I'll take two of those.
[86:46.88]I'll take three of those butterscotch candies.
[86:50.56]Get with the fucking program, guys, okay?
[86:53.46]Next, please.
[86:58.28]What's his line?
[86:58.64]I want to do this line.
[86:59.80]Hold on.
[87:00.04]Bad.
[87:00.16]Hmm.
[87:13.48]Hey, Zadok's a troublemaker.
[87:16.77]If it wasn't for the order, those fools would have sorted him out years ago.
[87:22.05]Unfortunately for us, that's not the case.
[87:25.81]I'll fucking take that job.
[87:26.79]Give me ten grand.
[87:27.63]I'll do it for ten thousand dollars.
[87:29.21]No little, no less.
[87:35.70]No, you know what?
[87:36.38]Fuck that.
[87:37.42]Fifty thousand dollars.
[87:41.93]I can do this better too.
[87:43.55]Look at this actor doing a fake snore.
[87:47.21]That's not how people snore.
[87:48.03]They snore like this.
[87:55.65]I fucked it up.
[87:56.49]Alright, let's go.
[87:57.13]Uh-oh.
[88:04.79]There's bugs all over this lady.
[88:06.29]I don't know.
[88:09.97]I'm getting crazy vision.
[88:12.30]I don't like this.
[88:14.52]It won't budge.
[88:17.14]Dead?
[88:17.56]You're dead, huh?
[88:19.44]I could do a better job than that.
[88:23.32]Dead?
[88:28.62]Fuck, just went in her mouth.
[88:36.87]It won't budge.
[88:37.63]Uh-oh.
[88:40.91]Is he going to be here?
[88:45.47]I think he's going to be on the balcony, right?
[88:49.30]Keep your eyes peeled for like... I don't think this does anything.
[88:54.88]I'll probably have to come on here later.
[88:56.52]Nope, I can go down here.
[89:03.82]So what?
[89:04.46]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[89:05.08]I don't think I want to do this.
[89:06.74]Do I want to do this?
[89:09.04]I'll make sure I didn't miss any doors.
[89:14.96]I can do better than that.
[89:15.74]I can eat at least five bugs.
[89:18.56]It won't budge.
[89:21.65]It won't budge.
[89:24.47]I'm still a strong contender for the annual twitchies?
[89:27.83]What the fuck is a twitchie?
[89:30.51]Don't want to miss that.
[89:40.88]Nothing of interest here.
[89:42.60]The twitchies.
[89:45.63]I'm not going to win a Twitchy.
[89:48.49]This almshouse is home to the old and the destitute.
[89:52.17]Destitute.
[89:54.23]Alright, I guess I do have to go that way.
[90:02.25]And this year, the nominees for Best Breakout Streamer go to... Jerma985.
[90:17.17]And I'm like fucking crying and like shaking everybody's hands and stuff.
[90:27.87]And the nominees for next year's most hysterical streamer go to... It won't budge.
[90:38.68]Nobody.
[90:39.62]Nobody was good enough.
[90:40.96]And then they fucking close the envelope and the lights turn off.
[90:45.50]Where is everybody?
[90:46.74]It's very quiet.
[90:48.36]It's getting late, Outsider.
[90:50.38]Folk says no one's good for a more savory boat in their homes by now.
[90:54.22]Best voice.
[90:58.02]Outsider!
[91:00.83]That was a person with, like, eating something.
[91:03.35]That's what it sounds like when you eat pig slop and try to talk.
[91:05.59]Uh, I guess we're going this way.
[91:13.15]I'm looking for Brian Burnham.
[91:15.35]I can't see as I notice what you're saying, stranger.
[91:19.79]What about this house?
[91:21.87]Uh-huh.
[91:26.58]And the nominee for most phoned-in live stream.
[91:30.58]Hi, sir.
[91:31.88]Are your parents at home?
[91:33.72]Daddy's at work, and Mommy's upstairs.
[91:36.40]I was just going to say, like, I was going to say, like, a name that wasn't me.
[91:41.66]That would have been bad.
[91:42.16]What's your name, little lady?
[91:44.22]Right now I wish that fucking rock music was starting to play.
[91:49.73]Faintly.
[91:50.65]Just like, go go go go go go.
[92:15.22]And the closer I get to the door, like the monster breaks through and then it fucking makes a huge guitar riff.

[93:13.00]I'm going to open this door and then here comes the rock music.
[93:18.44]Why would you put a bolt on the outside of the door?
[93:20.32]Oh no, the door has been bolted shut.
[93:25.97]On the outside.
[93:28.77]Keeping everyone that they want to keep out in.
[93:32.41]Close the door.
[93:36.83]Oh boy, here we go.
[93:41.04]It is to keep something in.
[93:43.72]They've got a double lock here.
[93:45.24]They've got dual refrigeration.
[93:47.04]They've got a fridge inside their fridge.
[93:50.72]Welcome to the land of Oz.
[93:52.80]I see you've got four people.
[93:54.78]Come on in.
[93:56.53]The party's waiting for you.
[93:57.73]That would have been scary, but I didn't care.
[94:05.95]Oh shit, he actually got out.
[94:08.57]Oh, whoops.
[94:11.07]I accidentally let out the fucking fish monster.
[94:19.08]Is it the little girl?
[94:21.96]Oh god.
[94:23.14]Did I... I bolted him in, didn't I?
[94:29.96]Good thing I closed the door.
[94:31.26]Wait, I have to move?
[94:33.72]Am I a bug?
[94:37.83]I just got like... Okay, I died and I came back to life.
[94:41.09]Reincarnation has like a cockroach.
[94:43.89]And then somebody just squashed me and I came back to life with something else.
[94:52.94]Oh, I came back to life as me.
[94:57.64]What was in here?
[94:58.12]A bed.
[95:00.98]An old mattress.
[95:02.42]Looks like a diary.
[95:09.03]An old wardrobe.
[95:09.89]There's nothing in here.
[95:11.95]So very obviously, this guy is going to be like a shapeshifter, right?
[95:17.99]It won't open.
[95:20.07]Why did you let it out?
[95:24.80]Why did you let out my mutant goldfish?
[95:28.10]Oh fuck, this actually is like pretty heavy.
[95:29.58]I better be quiet.
[95:35.65]Oh god, no.
[95:39.07]They've taken the last thing I love away from me.
[95:43.52]I'm sorry.
[95:44.22]I didn't realize what was up there.
[95:46.80]What the hell was that thing?
[95:48.18]There's no time to explain.
[95:51.22]They'll be here soon.
[95:53.80]Listen to me closely.
[95:54.94]I didn't know that was up there.
[95:56.07]You've been the talk of the town all day, asking after the Burnham lad.
[96:02.31]I heard he never made it to Boston, that he was caught by the Order of Dagon.
[96:07.89]Did he pocket anything from the store's safe?
[96:10.69]Thankfully, no.
[96:11.99]It's sturdy.
[96:13.03]You'd never have wrenched it open with a crowbar.
[96:15.97]There's something in there that needs protecting from the Order.
[96:19.10]You've got to get it out of Innsmouth.
[96:21.68]Take the key to the back of my store.
[96:23.84]The safe combination's in my diary, upstairs.
[96:27.40]Hurry, Jack!
[96:28.84]What the hell's in the safe, anyway?
[96:35.89]I don't want to go on the swing.
[96:37.45]I don't like the swing.
[96:39.03]Papa never pushes me right.
[96:40.68]Jesus.
[97:05.41]Okay.
[97:07.09]Alright, well, I gotta go to the safe.
[97:14.87]It won't budge.
[97:16.21]An old chest of drawers.
[97:17.29]It won't budge.
[97:18.37]Where's the safe?
[97:20.99]It won't open.
[97:21.87]What?
[97:26.09]I thought... It's a recent family photo.
[97:29.07]The corner's been torn off.
[97:30.47]I must be in it.
[97:31.25]I can only see Thomas and Ramona Waits in the picture.
[97:36.11]I wonder who else could be in that picture it won't budge it's probably it's probably some bad die bad die it won't budge you know something like little kids can't say g like the word like a guy or good it's die I want to give it to that bad guy let's do it oh watch out for that bad guy
[98:05.60]Did you hear about Thomas Waits?
[98:07.78]Nothing I want to talk to you about, stranger.
[98:11.34]This is great.
[98:12.12]Alright, where is this person's store?
[98:16.42]Is it the variety store?
[98:19.92]It won't open.
[98:24.70]Somebody that I, one of my friends, a little brother's grown up, used to say, one of you would always tell us to shut up.
[98:31.71]Except he would go, shut up.
[98:35.99]Here we go.
[98:36.51]No, you shut up.
[98:40.97]You shut up, you butt head.
[98:46.05]It was very, very, it was very cute.
[98:54.02]Yeah.
[98:57.18]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[99:02.76]How do I get out of here?
[99:04.10]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[99:10.10]GoldfishStreamer forgets plot, he really does.
[99:12.24]I was too busy talking about my fucking friend's little brother from like 30 years ago.
[99:27.29]What the fuck have I done?
[99:29.23]I stopped paying attention to the fucking game.
[99:33.29]This is why, like, I can't be trusted anytime I play a game like this.
[99:35.89]Because, like, I sit here and I go on a tangent and I forget the whole fucking, the whole game.
[99:40.94]I would rather just talk and then I forget everything.
[99:50.22]Like, where the fuck am I even, what am I even doing?
[99:55.89]You're in the fucking way now.
[99:57.19]Oh, thank God I found you.
[99:59.43]Waite's been arrested for the murder of his daughter.
[100:02.67]I know.
[100:03.71]It's my fault, Rebecca.
[100:06.03]What are you talking about, Jack?
[100:07.71]What's your fault?
[100:09.61]There was something in the attic.
[100:12.22]Some kind of animal.
[100:13.66]Read the diary.
[100:14.64]I have the diary.
[100:15.52]It's all my fault.
[100:17.78]the police drag weights off he can't take the fall for this he's done nothing wrong we gotta do something I have 80 HD him lynched for it I do there's nothing you can do oh you must have taken quite a bang in there Jack your head's bleeding yeah I think I was out of it for a little while
[100:40.00]I see you've got some bandages.
[100:42.22]Use them on your head.
[100:43.80]It'll help you heal.
[100:44.88]Call of Cthulhu gameplay, but every time he says it won't budge, it goes faster.
[100:49.98]Thanks, Rebecca.
[100:50.82]Oh, man.
[100:55.85]Thanks, Rebecca.
[101:02.97]The door touched me.
[101:04.43]The monster didn't touch me, but the door blasted off into my face.
[101:12.90]Alright.
[101:14.18]It's time.
[101:17.16]It's time.
[101:19.30]Let's go.
[101:19.96]Let's go do the thing we need to do.
[101:24.07]What?
[101:26.51]Why am I lying on the ground?
[101:27.59]What's happening?
[101:31.11]What did I just do?
[101:32.11]Did I just lie down and eat like a Lunchables?
[101:35.06]Yeah, it's just about break time.
[101:38.16]Let me open up my ham and cheese Lunchables.
[101:46.59]Uh-oh.
[101:50.71]You don't look like your standard crook, sweetheart.
[101:55.03]Jesus, you crazy sap!
[101:56.65]Who the hell are you?
[101:58.35]Jack Walters.
[101:59.72]Private detective.
[102:01.24]And considering your recent break-in and entering, how about I ask the question?
[102:04.92]With a Capri Sun.
[102:05.82]Have you any idea who I am?
[102:08.66]No, and I really don't care.
[102:10.66]Curious as to why your audio keeps getting cut off.
[102:12.16]My family has influential contacts in the Order, so I'd advise you to mind your mouth.
[102:17.84]I'm from out of town.
[102:19.20]The order doesn't hold much sway with me.
[102:21.68]Say again?
[102:22.14]Really?
[102:22.42]Out of town, you say?
[102:24.30]How interesting.
[102:26.58]I'm Ruth.
[102:27.46]Ruth Billingham.
[102:28.98]Oh, okay.
[102:29.36]We got your name on it.
[102:29.94]You're Brian's broad.
[102:31.34]That figures.
[102:32.81]Brian?
[102:34.65]I don't believe I know a Brian.
[102:37.12]Yeah, right.
[102:38.42]I've been fed that line a thousand times.
[102:40.66]And from much better liars than you.
[102:42.20]Now it's happening to me.
[102:44.08]The rumor around town is that your lover boy is in the hands of the Order.
[102:47.31]It's like I'm mocking her.
[102:48.81]No, that's not true.
[102:50.21]They'll have him killed.
[102:51.93]It was all my idea.
[102:53.35]I just wanted a clean break from... What do you want me to do?
[102:58.75]I don't know.
[102:59.68]You're the detective.
[103:00.76]You think of something.
[103:01.56]Doubt.
[103:02.42]I'll be waiting out at the old fishing cannery the next two nights.
[103:05.52]Just past the abandoned railway station.
[103:07.72]I'm not gonna eat either.
[103:10.41]When you find him, give him this.
[103:12.79]He'll know it's from... From who?
[103:15.53]From who?
[103:17.09]I don't know who it's from.
[103:19.81]I'm never gonna get that puzzle.
[103:20.86]I don't know who that's for.
[103:21.64]Alright, what's the combination?
[103:38.98]Guys, we may have a big problem here.
[103:45.30]I can't let go of this.
[103:49.63]I actually physically cannot let go of this.
[103:53.71]I need to get it right or we can't progress the game.
[104:12.27]Read the diary for the combination.
[104:13.79]I can't open the diary.
[104:14.95]My hands are full.
[104:18.48]Read the diary.
[104:19.46]I can't.
[104:19.96]I can't do anything.
[104:22.50]I don't think you guys are realizing that I physically cannot let go of this device.
[104:27.38]I have to load the game again.
[104:50.42]G. Not G. It's not back.
[104:57.67]Oh, fuck.
[104:58.23]Did I just save the game?
[104:59.63]Okay, wait.
[105:00.17]It was delete.
[105:01.43]Okay, it was delete.
[105:05.55]It was backspace.
[105:06.97]That's how you get out of there.
[105:10.74]Let's see what it is.
[105:11.32]Alright, a collection of evidence.
[105:15.78]Diary Tom is where I am.
[105:22.12]Alright, what's the combination to your safe?
[105:25.16]Yesterday was her tenth birthday.
[105:26.86]The change cannot be far off.
[105:28.22]Her birth gave me such joy, so much that I still use the month, day, and year as the four-number combination for my safe.
[105:34.91]In that order, starting clockwise.
[105:40.93]What day was this?
[105:46.25]What day was this?
[105:47.63]Diary of Thomas Waite.
[105:48.57]When did you write this?
[105:58.80]Yesterday was her 10th birthday.
[105:59.90]When did he write this?
[106:08.20]Well, it's got to be, alright, so it's month, month, day, year.
[106:13.28]Wait, what do you mean year?
[106:15.50]Okay, so something, something, 22.
[106:17.52]Or like, it's like 19, like 22 or something.
[106:23.42]Let me set it on the first page.
[106:27.46]The last entry in the diary is from today.
[106:29.68]It reads, Another sleepless night, I lay awake, listening to the movements of that thing that I married, pacing about her locked room.
[106:38.00]Damn the town fathers for not hanging open marsh when they had the chance.
[106:41.20]No burning him and his whole filthy clan.
[106:46.01]I wish I could just leave, abandon my... No, no, where's the date?
[106:51.81]It's from today.
[106:53.71]So what's today's date?
[107:01.53]February 6 1922 when was she born Starting clockwise, right To I'm gonna say something to to to to to to
[107:26.05]So 1922.
[107:28.60]So 12.
[107:30.26]So something 12.
[107:31.42]So take one day off today's date and she was born 10 years ago.
[107:35.40]Yeah.
[107:37.14]So that'd be February 5th.
[107:39.82]February 2.
[107:40.24]2-5.
[107:40.28]2-5-1-2.
[107:40.52]2-2.
[107:40.66]2-1.
[107:40.74]2-2.
[107:40.78]2-6-1-2.
[107:54.94]Yeah, okay, so I got it.
[107:56.67]2, 5, 2, 6, 1, 2.
[107:58.53]Starting clockwise.
[108:01.03]So we go 2.
[108:06.19]Does this work like a regular safe?
[108:08.62]I'm sure it does, right?
[108:09.40]2, 5, 1, 2.
[108:13.12]No.
[108:21.07]I must have made a mistake.
[108:24.44]Does this work like a regular safe?
[108:26.98]Or no?
[108:28.40]Okay, here we go.
[108:38.25]Must have made a mistake.
[108:41.01]Start clockwise, goes counterclockwise.
[108:44.46]I know it's 2612, but does this work like a regular safe?
[108:50.88]Wait, what?
[109:04.44]Yeah, see?
[109:05.82]Yes, that's it.
[109:07.84]I didn't know if it worked like a... There's only like six... Look at the amount of digits on there.
[109:12.32]I didn't know if it was working like a normal, actual safe.
[109:17.90]The safe holds a heavily bound manuscript.
[109:20.74]The front is embossed with the words Book of Dagon.
[109:30.09]The guy knew it was a difficult task, so he made a save point in the safe.
[109:39.15]I figured that out.
[109:40.05]I figured it out.
[109:40.81]I didn't even need to get the second diary.
[109:42.37]Everyone was freaking out about it.
[109:45.54]Everybody just stop freaking out.
[109:47.18]Let's go get the book.
[109:47.98]A heavily bound manger with the book of Dagon.
[109:51.76]Okay, I got the book.
[109:53.34]I got the Dagon book.
[109:58.39]What about anything else in here?
[110:00.55]It won't budge.
[110:01.51]No, it's time to go take this book.
[110:03.89]Go read it to somebody.
[110:08.75]Okay, let's move.
[110:11.57]Go set the book on fire.
[110:12.71]Yeah.
[110:18.58]Crack the safe, rob the bank.
[110:19.94]You don't have to.
[110:25.70]So, uh, now...
[110:38.51]Can I go in here?
[110:39.51]Or do I have to just go to the hotel?
[110:42.58]So we gotta go to the hotel and sleep in the hotel room.
[110:47.84]Out of the way, you fucking fake citizens.
[110:58.14]Alright.
[110:59.57]What do you got for me for a room?
[111:00.83]Aha.
[111:04.17]I love that you can actually see him, though.
[111:05.23]Where is he?
[111:06.05]Isn't that the alley?
[111:09.70]Oh, if you're wondering, I can't see messages because if I alt-tab, the game crashes.
[111:19.39]And the only way I can see my second monitor is if I alt-tab and click over there and pull it up.
[111:24.43]So I can't read bits right now.
[111:27.19]Because the game will crash every time I alt-tab.
[111:29.37]Fuck.
[111:29.51]What the hell am I doing?
[111:30.82]God damn it.
[111:31.16]God damn it.
[111:39.33]There's important information there.
[111:40.79]That's great.
[111:41.23]Playing windowed mode?
[111:41.99]I don't know how to begin.
[111:45.62]What was I just seeing?
[112:09.61]Don't mind OJ.
[112:11.03]He comes into your room sometimes.
[112:26.92]So this guy's a murderer.
[112:28.66]Fine, thanks.
[112:30.12]It's just the sea air around these parts makes me queasy.
[112:34.07]I've been using that excuse a lot lately.
[112:35.81]Well, because the last week I've been playing games that are like 15 years old.
[112:40.83]And I will like break the stream if I alt-tab.
[112:44.18]That's the only reason why.
[112:45.06]Excuse me, sir.
[112:46.82]The Innsmouth Law doesn't like to be kept hanging about.
[112:49.14]I'll be right back with you shortly.
[112:51.76]Trust me, I do wish I could just... Actually, let's see if I can do this.
[113:00.44]Here he comes.
[113:14.49]Well, thanks for the easy key.
[113:16.07]He's gonna show up right in my face, isn't he?
[113:21.43]Do I have a finite amount of time to do this?
[113:26.62]Blood.
[113:26.94]The hatchet is encrusted with blood.
[113:29.90]Hatchet?
[113:30.38]I'm not touching it.
[113:31.50]What?
[113:31.82]Pick it up.
[113:32.28]Are you serious?
[113:32.64]There's severed body parts strewn all over the office.
[113:38.38]Why would I not pick up the hatchet?
[113:40.18]I wonder what secrets this book hold.
[113:43.68]Okay, I got Gilman's book.
[113:45.16]There's severed body parts strewn all over the office.
[113:49.58]Nothing else?
[113:50.08]Can't see anything of use.
[113:51.20]Alright, let's make it so it's not obvious.
[113:54.52]Wait, what was that on the ground?
[113:56.52]nothing alright what is this book uh post-mortem records she were a lively one and no mistake I kept her going as long as I could for the music she were making such a pair of lungs and after she wore were done I found those lungs on her look as good as they sounded
[114:20.52]Okay.
[114:51.70]bones were nearly all out before he died I was real careful around the arteries so he as he didn't lose any more blood than could be helped and he lasted a lot longer for it the flesh moved on its own as he tried to work his arm but with the bones gone there weren't nothing it could do just Twitch I took it out the strap so it could move free and I watched the new gag worked much better and he was more quiet than the last
[115:21.21]Next entry.
[115:23.67]Rained today.
[115:31.60]Rained today.
[115:34.82]Well, this guy's a sick fuck.
[115:36.32]That's good.
[115:38.88]I love you, BB.
[115:42.32]I love you, BB.
[115:43.22]Here he comes.
[115:52.37]What are you doing back there?
[115:53.63]I wonder what this guy's gonna chase like.
[115:55.97]How do I bludgeon him?
[115:57.79]Bludgeon.
[115:58.45]Press Q. Bludgeon.
[115:58.99]Okay.
[115:59.15]So I'm gonna have to struggle and fight this guy and...
[116:26.12]Come on in here.
[116:28.49]What if it wasn't him?
[116:30.75]What if he's just a cog in the wheel?
[116:37.99]What if it's not actually a bad guy?
[116:41.21]Oh, no, he is a bad guy.
[116:41.99]Look at that.
[116:42.25]You're still looking pallid, sir.
[116:44.39]You need to have yourself some rest.
[116:46.79]Sleep well.
[116:48.48]And keep down the racket.
[116:50.32]Us Innsmouth are quiet folk.
[116:55.79]What the fuck?
[116:57.97]Wait, what?
[117:01.15]Wait, who was that?
[117:03.07]Was that me?
[117:05.98]Who did that?
[117:06.98]Did I do that?
[117:07.74]I'm so confused as to what just happened on the screen.
[117:12.58]Was I just living through somebody's eyes?
[117:14.88]Okay.
[117:20.38]An old chest of drawers.
[117:22.26]It's late.
[117:23.44]I don't think it'd be wise to wake the other guests.
[117:27.64]I can move this, but I can't get in the right spot to move it.
[117:34.10]Unfortunately.
[117:35.50]Can I pull it?
[117:39.58]Nope.
[117:40.04]Nothing of interest.
[117:46.95]This is just my room.
[117:48.07]He's over here.
[117:51.50]It's locked.
[117:52.56]That's the room he's in now.
[117:53.66]Is he killing somebody in that room as we speak?
[117:56.72]Is he serial killing someone?
[117:58.90]It won't budge.
[118:01.80]Yeah, the guy's serial killing people.
[118:03.62]It won't open.
[118:06.24]It won't budge.
[118:08.50]It won't budge.
[118:09.54]I have to move that thing.
[118:15.86]I can't grab this and pull it.
[118:20.23]Should I just go to bed?
[118:20.89]This isn't my room.
[118:21.97]What?
[118:22.13]How is this not my room?
[118:23.43]Wait, this is my room.
[118:24.45]Well, alright, time to go to bed.
[118:25.45]Shit.
[118:25.67]Well, let's, like, close my doors up and bolt them so nobody can come get me.
[118:48.11]I can't move this.
[118:49.55]It's late.
[118:50.71]I don't think it'd be wise to wake the other guests.
[118:54.85]I gotta secure the room.
[118:57.65]It's not important.
[118:58.57]Alright, I'm safe.
[119:09.74]Yeah.
[119:11.62]Safe!
[119:14.20]Okay, this one can't be moved.
[119:24.88]So I actually had to bolt the doors to go to bed.
[119:29.20]It's a really odd way to go to sleep.
[119:40.01]Early evening.
[119:40.95]Inns of it turned out to be more dilapidated, depressed, and unwelcoming than initially expected.
[119:46.64]The stench of rotting fish fills the air while poverty and disease lie festering in every cobbled back street.
[119:53.89]Only a few of the inhabitants have been at all cooperative.
[119:57.19]The others are evasive and sometimes downright hostile.
[120:01.55]My detective's instinct tells me they're trying to hide something.
[120:04.73]Of course, I could simply be prejudiced by their look and manners.
[120:08.52]They're almost ugly enough to get me believing those local tales of the Innsmouth taint.
[120:14.36]Even so, I've been able to make some progress, finding Ruth Billingham was a lucky break.
[120:19.46]She's convinced Loverboy is still in one piece and being held in the town jailhouse.
[120:25.15]Rebecca Lawrence is clearly afraid- Where's Cthulhu?
[120:31.03]I'm just realizing this right now.
[120:33.63]Where's the monster?
[120:34.45]Isn't Cthulhu a giant fucking monster?
[120:40.88]Okay, whatever.
[120:43.64]The Order of the Dagon, some heathen religion.
[120:46.36]Brought back from the South Seas by Obed Marsh.
[120:49.28]Rituals on Devil's Reef.
[120:51.43]Those who wouldn't join massacred by some kind of monsters.
[120:54.57]Highlight that.
[120:55.79]Save it.
[120:56.33]Copy.
[120:57.69]Paste it.
[121:01.03]Somebody just gave $50.
[121:01.97]Ben Eleanor just gave $50.
[121:04.12]And a bunch of other people gave money too.
[121:06.86]I gotta save and go look at these.
[121:11.27]Alright, yeah, my body in the dream, but it's so strange I can't begin to describe it.
[121:14.02]Maybe it's some buried memory.
[121:16.18]I'm going to save and go catch up on bits.
[121:18.08]Because the game's going to crash, but it's okay.
[121:19.46]We'll come right back.
[121:21.48]The spooky vision thing is acting worse than ever.
[121:23.58]It used to be I could kind of see what people were thinking sometimes.
[121:27.23]But now it's going crazy.
[121:28.23]It's like someone's watching me all the time, tracking me from the rooftops and the shadows.
[121:32.35]Well, they are.
[121:33.53]I'm so edgy I can hardly think straight.
[121:34.91]If only I could get some decent bourbon in this miserable town.
[121:38.56]I had it, but I gave it to a guy on the street.
[121:40.72]Oh well.
[121:43.36]Okay.
[121:45.08]Saving game.
[121:57.51]Is he coming in the room?
[121:59.31]He's trying to break into my room, isn't he?
[122:09.00]The great city of Nakotas.
[122:13.18]Rest now, Jack.
[122:15.02]You are safe.
[122:19.06]What was in the light, Jack?
[122:22.44]Where do you want to go?
[122:26.90]We are my history, Jack.
[122:29.30]And your future.
[122:30.90]I don't understand.
[122:33.30]You live in time.
[122:39.91]Alright, they're gonna come to eat me The prophecy foretells of a giant monster that comes up from the ocean That's a beard like a Billy goat and it comes up and he goes I
[123:11.27]Here they come!
[123:11.99]Open up!
[123:12.43]Wake up!
[123:13.45]Come on, I gotta get out of this sleep paralysis.
[123:15.43]Wake up and fucking grab somebody.
[123:17.13]Grab a lamp.
[123:19.25]Attack of the Fishermen.
[123:27.38]Ooh, can't wait to taste this one.
[123:29.08]If it's wrong, just keep the noise down.
[123:35.06]Give me a shotgun.
[123:37.33]Yeah, he does.
[123:41.16]It's locked.
[123:42.32]Probably bolted on the other side.
[123:44.44]Why am I coughing?
[123:45.18]He's awake in there.
[123:46.78]I can hear him moving about.
[123:48.20]Oh, shit.
[123:49.52]Break the door down, you damn fool.
[123:54.12]Oh!
[123:55.27]Oh!

[127:13.06]Oh, God damn it, man.
[127:22.89]He's literally bolted.

[127:25.71]He's awake in there.
[127:27.61]He's awake in there.

[128:26.95]It is.
[128:27.85]It's fucking bolted.

[129:31.81]This way?
[129:32.99]Not that way.
[129:33.47]Through the window?
[129:43.40]I don't want to do it again.
[129:44.02]I don't want to do it again.
[129:44.82]I don't want to do it again.
[129:45.82]Wait, wait, wait.

[130:08.23]Dang it!
[130:14.02]What the fuck?
[130:15.72]Huh?
[130:23.82]Where am I gonna end up?
[130:30.48]Oh my god.
[130:41.59]What is the fucking quick heal?
[130:43.29]I can't even quick heal.
[130:44.64]Is there a quick heal?
[130:45.58]H?
[130:46.08]Of course it is.
[130:47.78]God damn it, I have to do this shit again.
[130:50.60]It's locked.
[130:52.80]Probably bolted on the other side.
[130:55.54]He's awake in there.
[130:57.38]I can hear him moving about.
[130:59.64]Break the door down, you damn fool.
[131:03.29]Quick, I see him.
[131:04.81]Check the door.
[131:10.80]I'll never beat this part.
[131:12.08]Who knows?
[131:12.56]I probably won't.
[131:24.55]Go!
[131:33.01]Go!
[131:33.29]Why is the screen shook and it fucking moved my character to the left?
[131:48.10]Get in there.
[131:52.04]Just duck through every time.
[131:55.94]Okay, go, go, go, go.
[131:59.09]Now, which way is the correct fucking way?
[132:01.39]Left or right?
[132:02.97]I don't understand.
[132:04.51]Like, I just gotta keep going left.
[132:09.31]Oh, give me a fucking brick, you asshole.
[132:11.79]He's up there.
[132:17.63]Damn it.
[132:19.37]They have the blade too, zombie.
[132:20.55]I can't move this.
[132:23.25]What do I do in here?
[132:24.77]Do I not scare this?
[132:25.81]Should I leave this person alone?
[132:27.35]I don't get it.
[132:29.23]Is there a window?
[132:30.11]Is there a window?
[132:31.21]Window.
[132:32.57]I don't care about the healing potion.
[132:35.15]I'm not losing this again.
[132:36.16]I don't fucking... I don't know.
[132:37.18]Jump.
[132:39.72]Wow, I almost didn't make it.
[132:42.50]What?
[132:52.15]Which way do I go?
[132:53.25]Fucking god damn it.
[132:56.31]I made it.
[132:57.17]I did it.
[132:57.69]That was too much.
[132:58.95]Don't fall through the ceiling.
[133:00.75]What's next?
[133:05.01]All the way to the end?
[133:09.08]Okay, fall through it.
[133:09.82]Safe point.
[133:16.02]What's hurting me?
[133:24.83]Save the point!
[133:25.41]Save the point!
[133:26.23]Save it!
[133:31.18]Okay.
[133:32.42]Heal.
[133:38.56]I'm good.
[133:42.67]Oh my god.
[133:43.95]This game, there was like no gameplay until right now and it just threw it all up in my face.
[133:49.99]Run around and lock the door, Scooby-Doo the enemies.
[133:56.14]In sneak mode, you'll be less visible to the enemies.
[133:58.68]Try using sneak mode to assess the route and the head and... Great.
[134:04.40]Now it's Metal Gear Solid.
[134:08.47]And, like, he... He did the thing that they do when they do... He turned his fucking body.
[134:15.65]Doesn't even matter, I'm gonna be fine.
[134:29.83]I'm in the shadows right now.
[134:31.37]I'm in the shadows like the game tutorial told me about.
[134:33.97]Dumbass.
[134:42.09]I'm okay.
[134:45.45]He has to reload.
[134:49.31]He has to reload.
[134:50.09]Now what if I... How the fuck do I get out of here?
[134:59.36]Don't get stuck!
[135:02.31]Fucking serious.
[135:05.03]Okay.
[135:07.83]I guess we're moving over here.
[135:09.09]Alright, they're trying to shoot.
[135:15.20]They can't hit me.
[135:15.70]That's fine.
[135:20.62]Almost into the vent.
[135:23.89]Can we be done with the escape pod version of the game?
[135:32.13]Finally.
[135:40.08]We want more of this.
[135:44.54]We wanted this.
[135:46.08]I know, we were talking about how the game wasn't a game, and now it's a game.
[135:54.25]Who is walking around?
[135:55.33]Is this the monster that's hanging out with them?
[136:03.04]What the hell was that?
[136:06.04]I'm going to laugh so hard if I just see a monster with a shotgun just walking around.
[136:09.37]I'm going to save it again here because I don't want to see that cutscene again.
[136:12.29]Alright, what's the goal here?
[136:22.72]Get to the end?
[136:23.22]You got it.
[136:33.34]Is that the monster across the way?
[136:34.48]Now what's the audible like?
[136:39.06]Can they hear me?
[136:40.48]I wish I could sneak kill or stealth knock somebody out.
[136:42.78]That would make things a lot easier.
[136:52.87]How would they have seen me?
[136:53.69]There's no way they would have seen me.
[136:58.79]We're going in here.
[137:02.16]These things aren't evil, right?
[137:03.98]They're walking at me kind of evilly.
[137:06.80]I thought I was going to start taking damage.
[137:11.47]These are red rats.
[137:13.01]So they're like red fire ants.
[137:14.25]They're the ones with the bad ones.
[137:15.61]They bite.
[137:27.02]Keep making our way across.
[137:29.50]There's a ladder.
[137:34.32]Spicy.
[137:37.78]I think he can smell me.
[137:43.92]Excuse me?
[137:45.16]Excuse me?
[137:45.66]Shiver me timbers!
[138:02.36]Move this.
[138:03.22]Save point.
[138:12.15]Somebody else just gave $50.
[138:12.99]I gotta get to... Okay, hold on a minute.
[138:16.53]Let's... Let's like... Take a minute here and... Just... I can't... No, it's... I can't have the game crash.
[138:25.49]I'll do all the bits.
[138:27.11]Fucking the game crashed.
[138:28.37]God damn it.
[138:29.97]Game crashed.
[138:30.71]I swear to God, don't ever say that word out loud.
[138:34.43]Well, now we're going to go over some bits.
[138:37.55]Good thing I just saved the game.
[138:41.15]Jesus.
[138:43.47]Okay.
[138:47.88]Let's go over some of these bits while we load the game back up.
[138:58.92]Hold on.
[138:59.74]That's really annoying.
[139:08.07]Was it the second crash?
[139:08.93]That's actually not that bad.
[139:13.11]Uh-huh.
[139:14.09]Turn this here.
[139:18.49]And... Actually, let me... I got a P, too.
[139:23.54]So I'm going to read some bits and then I'm going to go P.
[139:27.34]And from there, we shall... Oh, come on.
[139:30.64]Is it really fucked up now?
[139:32.64]What the hell is going on?
[139:35.44]Oh, God.
[139:36.72]It's like broke the whole thing.
[139:41.58]I can't escape it.
[139:42.44]It won't let me leave.
[139:45.80]Hold on.
[139:49.66]I'm gonna BRB, but not BRB.
[139:52.00]I'm gonna read some bits, and then I'm gonna pee and come back, and we're gonna keep going.
[139:56.92]So, let's just put the BRB screen up now.
[140:03.08]And let's go through these fairly quickly.
[140:06.41]Thank you, Knock, for the $1.
[140:07.73]Early streamer.
[140:08.37]I was.
[140:09.41]Sticks, Renegade, thanks for the $3.42.
[140:10.83]Halloween is over, which means it's Christmas time.
[140:12.67]All I want for Christmas is you.
[140:13.99]Also, when is Zumbini's?
[140:16.35]Next Monday!
[140:16.97]No, I'm just kidding.
[140:17.59]Don't take that for real.
[140:18.37]But thank you, Sticks, for the $3.42.
[140:20.43]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the bits.
[140:21.93]Hey, Crazy Streamer, how are you?
[140:24.60]Mostly lost thanks for the $1.
[140:26.00]At this point, you should probably just go to Goodwill and buy a PC with Windows 98 on it to play.
[140:30.74]You know, I've actually thought about doing that.
[140:32.84]I was going to do that.
[140:34.94]I was going to go on like eBay and buy like an old fucking like Windows 95 actual computer.
[140:39.92]But then I was thinking, how the hell am I going to stream that?
[140:42.45]That would be very awkward connecting that together to get that to stream through this PC.
[140:46.99]So maybe, but I don't think it'll work.
[140:50.59]But thank you.
[140:51.85]Thank you, Gunther, for the $1.
[140:53.49]Hey, Jeremiah.
[140:55.10]That was a great stream you just had.
[140:56.32]I really like the part where... Good night.
[141:00.17]Thanks, dude.
[141:01.61]Gummy Monk, thanks for the $5.
[141:02.39]When are you going to finish Warlock of Firetop Mountain?
[141:05.01]Probably never.
[141:06.93]It didn't scratch the same itch that Sorcery did, even though it's by the same guy, technically.
[141:12.51]Sorcery was just so much more fun, but thank you, Gummy.
[141:15.66]Albert McMull, thank you for the $3.
[141:16.94]Hey, Jerma, just out of curiosity, what do you find the most challenging about streaming?
[141:22.46]And what do you enjoy the most out of it?
[141:24.06]Thanks, keep it up.
[141:25.98]Well, definitely the most challenging thing is wanting to try to do something interesting every stream.
[141:32.46]Wanting to have every stream be fun and worth watching, I guess.
[141:41.10]I think about that every time I want to stream.
[141:42.74]I'm like, oh, what do I want to do?
[141:43.91]What could I have fun with?
[141:44.81]What would you guys think was funny or fun or interesting?
[141:47.89]It's pretty much every single day.
[141:50.51]That's probably the most challenging thing.
[141:51.77]And what do I enjoy the most?
[141:53.65]Kind of the same thing.
[141:55.05]It's fun to interact and find games and find interesting things to want to stream so we all can sit here and enjoy them.
[142:02.91]And we can all talk about them.
[142:04.35]Whether that's talking shit or talking about how fun they are.
[142:07.72]The challenge makes it fun for everybody, I think.
[142:12.19]So it's definitely just hanging out here and seeing the reactions that people have to certain things and seeing everybody's old favorite games and stuff that they used to love and it's all good.
[142:23.76]But thank you for the $3.
[142:26.26]Almost done.
[142:27.34]Thank you, Knock, again for the $1.50.
[142:30.24]Will you play the secret game you were going to play three days ago?
[142:32.78]Maybe you did and I missed it because I had to leave early.
[142:34.84]I hope you had fun playing Call of Cthulhu.
[142:37.02]Play Stalker.
[142:38.72]What the hell was the secret game going to be?
[142:41.18]Oh, I didn't play the secret game.
[142:42.64]That's right.
[142:43.04]Maybe I'll do that tomorrow.
[142:46.46]It's a secret game, so I can't tell you what it is, but thank you.
[142:49.54]Turian, thank you for the $5.
[142:50.80]Whenever I see your streams live, I know it's time to put on makeup.
[142:53.56]It's time to dress up right.
[142:54.60]It's time to raise the curtains on the Muppet Show tonight.
[142:58.26]That's a song lyric I can get behind, so thank you.
[143:00.58]Thanks for the $5, Turian, once again.
[143:04.38]Sergil Butt, thanks for the $1.
[143:06.06]Love you, Jermbo.
[143:06.70]Here's some money.
[143:07.08]Well, thank you.
[143:07.52]I appreciate it.
[143:08.06]Thanks for the $1.
[143:09.88]Foxafury, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[143:11.82]Quick, say something funny.
[143:14.82]Um... Yep.
[143:17.93]Yep.
[143:18.23]Yock.
[143:19.45]Yocko.
[143:20.31]That wasn't... I tried.
[143:21.87]Thanks for the 15 dollars.
[143:22.73]I do appreciate it.
[143:23.33]Uh... Atmasterfish.
[143:27.07]Thank you for the 250.
[143:28.85]Googlygariff, thanks for the 4 dollars.
[143:30.17]They all seem to be really considerate assholes in this game.
[143:33.20]Yes, they do.
[143:34.40]They're all controlled by a demon, so that would make more sense.
[143:37.77]Kyle Tari, thanks for the 150.
[143:39.61]Hey, Jerma, I've been saving these bits for you from watching ads, so just fucking take them, LOL.
[143:45.79]Well, thank you for going, sitting through ads to pay me money.
[143:49.61]That's very, very humbling to know that, that somebody is doing that, so thank you for that.
[143:56.18]To know that, like, somebody's, like, forcing themselves to sit through a bunch of fucking ads.
[144:01.10]Like, you don't have to do that.
[144:03.25]I appreciate it nonetheless, but you guys don't have to sit there and watch 300 ads to give me any money.
[144:09.72]Don't worry about it.
[144:11.38]I really don't want people to think that they're obligated to do something like that.
[144:14.44]But, thank you.
[144:17.69]Nightfang, thanks for the $1.
[144:18.89]Jeremiah, please say these lines in your Boston accent.
[144:22.25]What a beautiful dog to chew.
[144:25.39]There must be no other places... What am I saying?
[144:29.64]I don't like to say things.
[144:30.98]I don't like to say things.
[144:32.68]I don't know what it is.
[144:34.94]You know, I get scared when somebody's like, hey, say this out loud.
[144:38.88]Hey, I feel like I'm going to say something terrible.
[144:41.62]But thank you.
[144:44.71]Thank you for the $1 night thing.
[144:47.29]And then only a few more to read.
[144:49.65]Ben Eleanor, thank you for the $50.
[144:52.47]Such ADHD.
[144:54.19]Thank you for the $50, Ben.
[144:56.89]Billionaire Ben is what we're going to call you from now on.
[144:59.21]Ben the Billionaire.
[145:01.11]Thanks for the $50.
[145:01.89]You gave $50 twice, so you give $100.
[145:05.61]Thank you so much, dude.
[145:06.43]Pull apart Twizzlers or original Twizzlers?
[145:08.35]Pull apart Twizzlers.
[145:10.24]Original Twizzlers.
[145:10.98]Get them out of here.
[145:11.80]The ones that you pull off taste better too.
[145:14.14]But, Ben, thank you for the fucking $100.
[145:20.32]You are too kind.
[145:22.73]Your dad, thanks for the $1.
[145:24.03]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[145:25.79]Frostbiter for the $1.
[145:27.09]Forrealdo for the $1.
[145:29.73]Two things.
[145:30.29]One, play War of the Monsters and Megaton Rainfall in a future stream.
[145:33.83]Two, what can you tell us about your upcoming collab with Kryken?
[145:38.36]We actually were going to play something this week, but it turned out we couldn't play it.
[145:42.94]So we're working on something else, but it'll probably happen soon.
[145:45.84]We're just going to play something on stream together.
[145:47.20]It'll be fun.
[145:48.73]But caught up on bits.
[145:50.69]Thank you so much, guys, for your support.
[145:53.87]Untryhard right now with $1.
[145:55.54]When's that movie stream you promised a year ago?
[145:58.70]Who knows?
[146:00.26]At some point.
[146:02.18]And also, thank you to... Who did I miss?
[146:06.06]Did I miss anybody?
[146:06.95]No.
[146:07.51]There we go.
[146:08.13]Alright, let's get back to it.
[146:10.77]I forgot to, like, pee.
[146:11.85]Oh, well.
[146:12.41]I'll pee when I'm dead.
[146:14.29]You know what I mean?
[146:15.29]Let's go.
[146:20.76]Yeah, it wasn't anything like... We don't have like some big plan.
[146:26.32]Criken and I were just talking about playing a game together because we hung out at TwitchCon.
[146:33.69]And, you know, from there we were like, yeah, we should play a game together.
[146:37.43]And that stemmed a conversation to play something and then it stemmed a conversation to play something else and we'll see how it goes.
[146:46.30]Alright, opening the game again.
[146:48.77]Thank you for your patience.
[146:50.99]And thank you for the bits, everybody.
[146:53.29]And for the subs and resubs.
[146:54.39]You guys are fucking awesome.
[146:56.89]Thank you.
[146:57.65]Let's go.
[147:01.10]Please go pee.
[147:01.76]No.
[147:02.10]I'll sleep when I pee.
[147:04.18]You know what I mean?
[147:08.86]Honestly.
[147:13.24]I do have to pee, but whatever.
[147:14.38]I'm not gonna go pee.
[147:16.14]Doesn't matter.
[147:20.37]Okay, a little game.
[147:21.41]It's this one, right?
[147:22.15]Yeah.
[147:25.69]Attack of the Fisherman.
[147:26.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[147:26.81]Wait a minute.
[147:27.19]Attack of the Fisherman.
[147:28.11]Didn't I already do this?
[147:29.89]Okay, good.
[147:31.81]So this can be moved.
[147:33.17]Let's... Oh my god.
[147:34.87]Okay, don't touch that box.
[147:36.53]How do I touch this box without the game crashing?
[147:38.09]I don't know.
[147:42.70]There's got to be a way to touch this box without the game breaking.
[147:48.24]Do I have to go in here?
[147:52.68]I hope not.
[147:54.02]Because I don't think it's gonna happen.
[148:01.94]The box of Cthulhu.
[148:04.68]Um... I have to go that way.
[148:08.93]Shit.
[148:10.19]Okay, let's, like, do this weirdly.
[148:12.57]I'm gonna crouch and, like, walk over here.
[148:16.31]And then...
[148:21.76]Sneak up around.
[148:23.33]And I'm going to back up into it.
[148:29.97]It's working.
[148:31.89]Just don't look at the box.
[148:39.12]And success.
[148:48.18]Let's go.
[148:52.54]We made it past the crash zone.
[148:56.00]Save it?
[148:57.14]There's no way to save right now.
[148:58.44]I gotta save it in some other room.
[148:59.64]So where does that put me?
[149:07.55]Can I jump up this?
[149:08.51]No, I think I'm just gonna go around here.
[149:17.89]Christ, I didn't know there was a guy gonna be right here.
[149:22.23]I think I can make it up.
[149:28.94]Um, well, there's a... Pick it up!
[149:33.24]Pick it up!
[149:33.88]What do you mean?
[149:34.32]Wait, I think I have too many health kits.
[149:42.27]This can't be opened.
[149:49.33]Fuck, here he comes.
[149:50.75]I gotta go through that, uh,
[149:53.76]Huh.
[149:54.14]Okay.
[149:54.94]You know, the AI from like 10 years ago might not see me.
[150:04.41]And we're gonna have to reload the fucking game again.
[150:06.79]Because I turned the wrong direction.
[150:10.35]Who's there?
[150:27.89]What is going on with my character?
[150:33.38]Yes, I am over here.
[150:34.44]Oh my fucking god.
[150:49.03]Fucking... I would say trial and error dog shit, but I'm not going to.
[150:53.11]In fact, I would love to say that out loud right now.
[151:03.65]Use the box as a weapon.
[151:04.75]I wish I had any weapon.
[151:07.55]Anything at all would work with me.
[151:11.33]You just did.
[151:14.49]Make them look at the box so they crash.
[151:19.76]It's not a bad idea.
[151:26.68]Okay, so should I wait for this guy?
[151:28.14]Should I just run?
[151:28.76]Or just wait for him to walk by?
[151:30.02]Is he going to walk in here?
[151:33.42]I'm sure he's going to turn around.
[151:37.02]Wish I had that in lean.
[151:48.68]And... In the clear.
[151:50.86]There's a guy right there.
[151:59.88]Do I go up in that...
[152:02.18]Dammit, this guy's gonna pounce on me.
[152:04.45]Let's see if we can see him.
[152:07.55]Look up.
[152:10.73]Do you see him?
[152:11.41]I don't.
[152:12.07]I don't.
[152:12.51]Wait, no I don't.
[152:13.37]I thought I did.
[152:19.28]I don't.
[152:20.30]Can't go that way.
[152:28.51]Come on, jump.
[152:29.19]Come on.
[152:30.15]Jump up there.
[152:31.33]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[152:34.39]And I just, like, broke my fucking leg.
[152:35.89]I broke my leg.
[152:39.42]I smashed my leg.
[152:41.54]Ugh.
[152:41.66]It's time for him to walk by, and he should be good to go, right?
[152:52.50]Don't stand up.
[152:53.30]That's not smart.
[153:00.07]There he goes.
[153:06.01]Left or right here?
[153:09.26]I'm going to say right because it's probably... That one won't open.
[153:12.62]Can I make it this way?
[153:13.60]Don't turn around yet.
[153:14.90]Don't do it yet.
[153:15.48]Don't do it yet.
[153:16.06]Ha ha.
[153:21.25]Hey, Captain Magic, thanks for the 20 bucks.
[153:23.23]Hey, Jerma, I love your videos.
[153:24.37]Whenever I feel like shit, I watch your Death to Spies video, and it never fails to make me feel better.
[153:28.83]Thanks for the hours of entertainment.
[153:29.89]Well, thank you, Captain Magic, for the 20 bucks.
[153:33.81]Appreciate it, man.
[153:36.23]Uh... That Death to... Oh, goodness.
[153:39.41]J... Jaiko!
[153:42.46]I did it.
[153:42.98]I caught another one.
[153:44.40]Heck yeah.
[153:44.96]My mom says I can't swear.
[153:48.34]Jaiko, thank you for the 50 dollars.
[153:51.76]Did I go back again?
[153:53.14]Coming in with the $50 spot.
[154:02.16]Thank you so much, man.
[154:06.17]50 smackaroos.
[154:08.33]Five.
[154:09.55]Zero.
[154:11.05]Fucking god.
[154:12.31]Damn it.
[154:13.69]Of course it won't open.
[154:16.59]Oh my god.
[154:17.35]Ahhhh.
[154:24.39]shooting from that far away you wouldn't be able to shoot me like that you can't hit me what the fuck was that save point
[154:53.99]Your friend is dead.
[154:56.12]Jesus Christ, no!
[154:58.72]You're a fool, Willie!
[155:00.04]I told you it wasn't... Look, Phil.
[155:04.30]I know you're upset, but I really need some help.
[155:07.46]Ah.
[155:08.02]You're the outsider they're hunting tonight.
[155:10.81]You don't have a hope, stranger.
[155:12.65]The Order's mob will be everywhere you... Down the sewers is the only place that them folks balk at venturing.
[155:18.63]And for good cause at that...
[155:20.75]I can cope with foul air.
[155:22.31]It'll be a change from the stink of dead.
[155:26.63]You're not getting my meaning, stranger.
[155:28.92]There's rumor of real horrors in the black dankness beneath.
[155:33.12]Maybe the folk with the tain are devils.
[155:36.24]But at least they're devils of this Earth.
[155:38.64]You ever hear tell of a... Just tell me where I can get into the sword.
[155:43.22]Alright.
[155:44.76]You've been warned.
[155:46.31]Just the other side of this here building is a road leading down to the filtration plant.
[155:51.66]Okay.
[155:57.24]Thank you for the help.
[156:00.31]What I was going to say is that Death to Spies video.
[156:05.05]I'm not kidding.
[156:06.29]I sat in that grenade room for at least an hour or two.
[156:13.45]I couldn't stop doing it.
[156:14.96]Imagine if I was streaming that game and I didn't leave that room for two hours.
[156:21.96]I'm not sure if you guys would like that or love that.
[156:24.26]I'm not sure if you'd like it or love it.
[156:27.98]It's just a trash can.
[156:29.64]Nothing of interest.
[156:30.93]I might have a broken leg or something.
[156:36.87]I can't run fast.
[156:37.69]There we go.
[156:48.65]What did that do?
[156:49.13]Can I push this?
[156:54.86]Can I get inside of here?
[156:57.60]Oh no, this is moving.
[156:59.35]Oh god.
[157:02.03]Was I supposed to do that?
[157:02.99]This guy's gonna hit run over.
[157:06.91]Oh god.
[157:24.60]um okay was I supposed to be in the truck this gate is blocking the way to the filtration plant I should have rode on top of that or inside I couldn't get in it I want to try that again I'm gonna get I have to get inside the car
[157:58.15]There's no point going back that way.
[158:00.29]What the fuck was that?
[158:02.25]There's no point going back that way.
[158:03.97]Did you see that?
[158:07.55]You're just inside.
[158:08.51]That was really weird.
[158:09.39]Okay.
[158:15.50]Let's actually get inside the truck.
[158:25.03]Alright, take it out.
[158:26.29]Get in the back.
[158:33.37]I don't think I can get in here.
[158:40.76]I don't think I can get in this.
[158:41.64]No, man, I just... Get in the car!
[158:52.09]Why can I not just jump in the back of the fucking car?
[158:56.89]Do I have to, like, get on the stairs and then jump in when I can't just jump in there?
[158:59.91]What am I, like a dog jumping on a high bed?
[159:02.07]What?
[159:02.37]Why?
[159:03.73]What the fuck?
[159:04.41]Why?
[159:05.44]I can't just jump in the back.
[159:14.28]So I have to pull the thing off and walk up the stairs to jump into the car.
[159:28.67]Why can I not just jump in the back?
[159:30.91]It's clearly at, like, shin level.
[159:35.73]Wait, hold on.
[159:36.47]I want us to see what happens here.
[159:42.24]So I have to come up here and walk in like this.
[159:45.40]Yeah, if only I could get it to move.
[159:49.22]If only I couldn't just jump in there.
[159:51.58]Jump in the back of the fucking car.
[160:02.62]Get out of the way.
[160:07.05]Fan-fucking-tastic!
[160:08.99]Fantastic!
[160:25.46]Give me a break.
[160:30.72]I did legitimately the exact same thing.
[160:36.98]Nothing changed.
[160:37.94]I did the exact same fucking thing.
[160:40.16]Nothing changed.
[160:41.90]Why did it change this time?
[160:48.86]Seems like a dangerous place to park.
[160:54.06]My fucking leg is broken again.
[160:55.61]God damn it.
[161:00.24]Fix your leg in here.
[161:01.20]Am I supposed to jump out of here?
[161:09.94]Just running into stuff.
[161:16.49]Get away from my grand escape.
[161:17.81]This is gonna hurt me, right?
[161:19.33]Should I jump out?
[161:24.65]Oh, shit.
[161:26.23]It's got a hundred dollars.
[161:30.08]No, I have to... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[161:31.92]That's a fan.
[161:35.66]This way?
[161:37.24]Nope.
[161:39.47]Over here.
[161:42.33]Metal bar.
[161:43.97]I have to wedge this in here.
[161:47.60]Don't walk into this.
[161:52.04]Come on now, really?
[161:56.38]Come on!
[161:57.18]I have to climb up?
[162:04.38]I mean, that's... That's the easiest... That's the solution, right?
[162:15.46]I'm not out of my mind, am I?
[162:21.71]Why would this be here?
[162:22.29]I think I have a way.
[162:22.82]I don't have a way.
[162:23.30]Okay.
[162:23.46]I can't just, like, wedge it in there?
[162:24.76]Oh, I got some more money.
[162:49.43]I'm getting a lot of bits tonight.
[162:52.09]Press E on fan.
[162:53.03]That's what I was just trying to do.
[162:56.45]Get closer.
[162:57.34]What about this?
[162:57.80]No, that's a tire.
[163:04.74]Is this just a pixel hunt?
[163:07.54]Is that what this actually is?
[163:08.46]Just run through.
[163:21.08]If only I could feel some... Okay.
[163:26.49]...way to stop this fan.
[163:28.41]I... ...be able to get out of this... Is this... Where's my...
[163:45.55]Holy, there was a way to stop the fan.
[163:49.83]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[163:52.09]Oh, fucking God.
[163:55.59]Oh my God, I'm getting so much money.
[164:00.44]Look at the center of the fan.
[164:01.82]Didn't I try that once or twice?
[164:04.02]I need to like alt tab and see these bits.
[164:12.82]That, like, $300 just came in.
[164:15.48]In, like, 20 minutes.
[164:16.40]Holy shit.
[164:20.18]Okay, let's try this again.
[164:21.22]I gotta get to a point where, like, I'm fine.
[164:23.70]You know what I mean?
[164:26.40]Alright.
[164:26.90]I'm fine here.
[164:27.48]Who's making that noise?
[164:32.04]Cut that out, please.
[164:42.57]There we go.
[164:49.56]Go buy a switch with that money.
[164:54.98]I'm gonna be able to run for president.
[164:56.54]Okay, metal bar.
[164:59.38]Right in the middle of the fan, right in the left of the fan, we'll find it.
[165:01.66]Sturdy looking metal bar.
[165:07.69]Okay.
[165:08.09]Y'all saw that.
[165:09.61]I tried.
[165:10.01]And that's not... What?
[165:11.55]Huh?
[165:11.71]Wait a minute!
[165:12.44]Oh, God.
[165:13.66]I have to do it.
[165:17.80]I have to time it.
[165:33.79]Why did it go so fast right there?
[165:36.05]Goddammit.
[165:39.25]Come on, wait.
[165:42.92]I just got bumped into it.
[165:44.48]Why?
[165:44.84]Oh, my lord.
[165:47.14]Oh, for the love of God.
[165:56.26]It went even.
[165:57.02]All I did was make it go faster.
[165:58.52]That's all I did.
[166:02.46]Hit it again.
[166:05.55]Okay, now I can take a secondary.
[166:07.68]I need to, I want to see those bits.
[166:09.40]I don't have enough health.
[166:16.61]Wait, let me get to his actual save point.
[166:19.31]That'll make more sense.
[166:20.21]Yeah, we're in the dankness now.
[166:36.37]Hall of Cthulhu.
[166:40.17]The dark corners of the Earth.
[166:49.76]Hello?
[166:50.30]Oh, you're the- Oh, Dolly!
[166:53.36]Isn't that the- Can't pick that up.
[166:57.00]Isn't that the girl that got killed by the fish monster?
[167:01.26]Who is the fish?
[167:01.94]I have an image in my head of that monster and what it is and where it's from.
[167:05.30]I can't put my finger on it, though.
[167:09.22]I'm trying to remember.
[167:09.94]It's like an old TV show.
[167:14.46]What the hell is all this stuff?
[167:18.57]Ah, shit!
[167:19.49]It's corrosive!
[167:23.33]Ah, it's corrosive!
[167:26.79]Ew!
[167:27.79]It's poisonous!
[167:30.20]His body is covered in this slimy muck.
[167:32.66]Let's get this saved.
[167:36.52]Alright.
[167:37.66]Now let me go see what those bits said.
[167:39.36]Because that was a lot of money.
[167:43.26]Hopefully it won't break.
[167:45.03]But it's probably going to.
[167:47.69]Yes it is.
[167:48.55]It crashed.
[167:50.89]But I got it saved.
[167:51.75]I just want to see these.
[167:55.81]Holy shit.
[167:56.31]That's a lot of money.
[167:58.21]Well, let's start with... I can open it again.
[168:00.85]I just couldn't see it there.
[168:02.85]Okay.
[168:04.43]Bug Catcher.
[168:05.19]Thank you, Bug Catcher, for the $2.50.
[168:07.92]Appreciate it.
[168:08.42]$2.50.
[168:10.20]Mr. Bug Catcher.
[168:13.56]Jaiko, thank you for the first $100 here.
[168:17.54]Can someone just give Cthulhu a call?
[168:20.35]I would if I could.
[168:21.09]That is a $100... That is a $100 sentence.
[168:28.22]Thank you so much.
[168:29.16]That's the first $100 you gave.
[168:32.18]Your second $100.
[168:34.44]$100.25 to be exact.
[168:36.28]Hello, this is Jaiko's mother.
[168:37.78]I'm going to have to ask this Mr. Ben to stop donating to... What happened?
[168:42.52]There's something down here.
[168:46.53]Oh, I thought I just died.
[168:47.71]I'm going to have to ask him to stop donating to Jerma without his permission.
[168:55.91]Thank you very much for understanding.
[169:00.22]It was $125.
[169:03.08]Thank you, Jaiko.
[169:04.28]For the $200.25.
[169:05.04]Or Jaiko's mother, sorry.
[169:11.24]Either one of you.
[169:13.42]And then in between there, Adolfo gave $50.
[169:20.16]AdolfoGoy1 gave $50 as well.
[169:23.83]They said, Hey Jerem, I haven't caught your stream in a while because college has been super stressful.
[169:27.55]Been watching you since middle school.
[169:30.18]And you always make me laugh and you always make me feel better.
[169:32.30]You're my favorite entertainer.
[169:33.54]Thank you so much.
[169:35.04]That means you've been watching since like seven years ago.
[169:39.20]That's a long fucking time, man.
[169:42.62]So wait a minute.
[169:43.08]So you were in middle school and now you're in college.
[169:48.89]So that means you've been watching me for like ten years.
[169:57.63]Damn.
[170:01.46]That's a long time.
[170:04.88]I gotta do a $200 joke?
[170:08.57]That's gonna be hard, man.
[170:09.83]How do you get a quality $200 joke?
[170:12.03]It's hard.
[170:17.05]Oh, I'm going down the stairs.
[170:20.21]What is it saying?
[170:22.57]Come on down here.
[170:23.65]It was one guy.
[170:31.33]I'm gonna get jumpscared, I know it.
[170:43.14]Here it comes.
[170:45.14]Somebody's flushed the toilet.
[170:48.76]Ah, I hear a slimy thing, slimy thing.
[170:50.66]What's this do?
[170:52.56]I don't know.
[170:55.23]Ah, what is it?
[170:55.71]Something's here, something's here, something's here!
[170:56.83]I don't know what it is!
[170:57.55]Oh, goddammit.
[171:01.35]I'm not, like, letting something out, am I?
[171:07.31]Can't get up there?
[171:08.96]I can't climb the ladder?
[171:14.02]I guess I can't do anything there.
[171:20.39]I don't like this.
[171:21.49]Am I gonna turn on the gas or something?
[171:28.25]Now what?
[171:32.17]How's the jacuzzi doing?
[171:39.09]Okay, that opens it.
[171:43.05]So it's open and it slowly closes?
[171:44.51]Is that what I'm seeing?
[171:47.34]Okay, yeah, so how do I... What am I supposed to do here?
[171:56.26]Did I, like, raise or lower the water down here or something?
[172:01.88]Climb the ladder?
[172:02.76]I can't climb the ladder.
[172:03.70]It won't let me.
[172:09.07]The ladder is unclimbable.
[172:11.03]Unless the game just is broken and I can't do it.
[172:16.97]Holy shit.
[172:20.53]Ben Elnor just gave another hundred fucking dollars.
[172:24.35]And says... If you wish upon a star...
[172:30.88]Did I wish?
[172:32.22]What did I wish?
[172:32.82]I don't know.
[172:35.31]But there's another $100 from Ben.
[172:38.93]I need to look up to climb.
[172:42.79]Oh, what?
[172:43.97]I was trying to climb this for like 10 straight seconds.
[172:52.13]Come on, really?
[172:53.89]There's no rain in the water.
[172:55.49]Did I seriously just hurt my leg doing that?
[173:03.58]Somebody wished for $100.
[173:04.66]How's that?
[173:08.46]Better?
[173:08.70]There we go.
[173:14.69]It's coated in slime.
[173:16.51]I'm not touching it.
[173:17.55]What are you talking about?
[173:18.53]It's coated in slime.
[173:22.23]It's coated in slime.
[173:23.83]I'm not touching it.
[173:25.13]Do I have to clean it?
[173:26.75]What?
[173:31.64]Which one of these is the water?
[173:33.54]One of these is water and one of these is slime.
[173:35.82]Which one is water?
[173:36.54]That sounds like slime.
[173:39.60]If I was slime, that's what I would sound like.
[173:42.12]God damn it.
[173:44.26]Yeah, no way I'm getting in.
[173:48.90]But I don't understand this.
[174:07.07]Like, why can I not just walk in there when it was raining?
[174:10.87]Because these are both on.
[174:13.05]The tank's full of slimy water.
[174:15.51]There's no way I'm getting in.
[174:20.77]Now, the one on the left looks, like, fucking dirty.
[174:31.47]I mean, like...
[174:37.11]Right?
[174:37.31]Doesn't that make sense?
[174:45.80]The tank's full of slime.
[174:47.62]What about in... It won't budge.
[174:48.98]I can't get in here.
[174:52.76]Turn them both... Well, I couldn't go in any... I couldn't even go... When they were both up, I already did this.
[175:00.82]When they both turned off, it's empty, but he goes, I'm not going in there.
[175:03.52]There's mud in there.
[175:09.25]Like, watch.
[175:09.63]Oh, I'm not going to do that.
[175:10.99]It smells in there.
[175:12.00]Oh, I don't want to touch that.
[175:16.74]It smells.
[175:24.48]So this is the normal water.
[175:25.86]I had it right the first time.
[175:28.55]Is this one the normal water?
[175:34.17]Because this one's corroded.
[175:35.79]I did this like three times already.
[175:44.95]Turn on the water.
[175:47.99]I'm gonna go turn the other one on.
[175:58.67]Okay, now we drain it.
[176:00.59]This is what I was going to do the first time, and then I just didn't.
[176:06.28]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[176:17.90]So that's not draining this water.
[176:20.86]So now turn it off.
[176:24.70]Okay, what the... What the fuck?
[176:30.94]Now I gotta turn it back off, turn it on, turn it off again, come back and turn it on, then drain it and turn it back on.
[176:37.95]Hey, where's the fucking monster?
[177:00.44]Oh no.
[177:05.26]Back, back is the cockroach again.
[177:06.65]Nice and dead.
[177:13.17]Look at this FOV.
[177:13.85]I feel like I shouldn't be seeing like this.
[177:15.77]This is not right.
[177:16.63]Okay, I'm gonna stand still because I don't, this, this, I don't think this is correct.
[177:22.22]Okay.
[177:31.43]Found the monster.
[177:32.19]I think that was supposed to be scary, but I wasn't looking in the right direction.
[177:37.88]I missed like the cool part.
[177:39.28]I just missed the cool part of the game.
[177:52.49]I'm not gonna fall.
[178:08.96]Singing girl.
[178:09.52]Let's find her.
[178:17.06]Hi.
[178:24.49]Scary girl.
[178:25.27]I think I need to heal.
[178:32.61]I'm gonna heal.
[178:34.41]My guy's having trouble walking.
[178:38.45]People of the Y, thanks for the $5.
[178:41.17]Jeremy Forehead phone.
[178:43.84]It's Bethesda phone.
[178:45.38]Make sure to make our game look good.
[178:48.92]Forehead phone.
[178:50.36]Check your PayPal phone.
[178:55.35]Thank you for the $5.
[178:56.39]People of the Y, thanks for another $5.
[178:58.93]Thanks for always being such a cool dude, Jermo.
[179:01.43]I've been watching you since the TF2 days, but always enjoyed your variety stuff.
[179:04.47]Glad you started streaming.
[179:05.51]Me too.
[179:05.85]It's a lot of fun.
[179:08.41]Did I just break my phone?
[179:09.59]I just healed up there.
[179:11.95]Get out of my ear, you fucking cartoon mouse.
[179:15.33]I don't like it.
[179:28.99]Oh no, SPIDERS!
[179:32.01]Wait, these like crabs- Oh my fucking god.
[179:34.99]Reload, it just killed me.
[179:37.19]I can't stomp them.
[179:39.01]I very clearly could step on them.
[179:41.65]I could stomp them, and it didn't do anything.
[179:45.30]Where's my daddy?
[179:47.08]Where's my daddy?
[179:48.12]Welcome for your spiders, daddy.
[179:50.42]They're big skinny crabs.
[179:55.40]I miss you, daddy.
[180:07.64]I'm still getting hurt.
[180:12.63]Why am I still in pain?
[180:17.67]Is there one on me?
[180:18.49]Is there one on my back?
[180:28.96]I'm just limping around.
[180:32.63]Am I actually poisoned?
[180:33.53]Do I have to syringe myself?
[180:34.49]I think I do.
[180:36.35]They're poison crabs.
[180:37.31]Of course they are.
[180:38.85]Why wouldn't they be?
[180:40.87]And it gives me foggy windshield vision.
[180:44.80]Morphine.
[180:48.02]I don't have an anti-poison.
[180:52.33]The grate doesn't seem to be fastened securely.
[180:56.27]The grating is loose.
[180:57.55]It hasn't been tightly fixed in place.
[180:59.35]Smash?
[181:01.59]The grate doesn't seem to be fastened securely.
[181:03.75]I could probably smash that.
[181:10.84]Smash?
[181:11.36]The grating is loose.
[181:12.64]It hasn't been tightly fixed in place.
[181:14.48]Smash?
[181:15.84]The grate doesn't seem to be fastened securely.
[181:19.10]It's the grate, the grate, the grate, the grate, the grate.
[181:21.24]Okay.
[181:21.38]Okay.
[181:23.98]Um, well, I need to find, like, a stick to wedge in here.
[181:29.14]I'm gonna go back to the crabs.
[181:34.23]None of these open?
[181:35.17]No.
[181:35.73]What is this?
[181:36.43]Aye, aye, aye.
[181:37.85]Back to the fucking crabs.
[181:41.89]This one opens.
[181:47.26]How would I...
[181:53.42]How would I know that was gonna be there?
[181:54.82]Does he come down here?
[181:56.64]God damn it.
[182:02.58]I have to go this way, don't I?

[182:55.87]What am I saying?
[182:56.47]Am I talking to myself?
[182:58.15]What am I becoming?
[182:59.53]What's happening to me?
[183:00.93]What do you mean you see me?
[183:07.17]What?
[183:08.19]What is even happening right now?
[183:09.41]What do I need to go?
[183:10.25]God damn it.
[183:11.55]That's a good front.
[183:21.02]Found here?
[183:24.04]Fucking god, it's broke my legs.
[183:25.60]Is there a door to go in?
[183:27.92]There is.
[183:28.60]Aye, aye, aye.
[183:30.82]Come on now.
[183:34.89]At least I can get this.
[183:44.73]So, how do I move that out of the way?
[183:51.23]This crate is blocking the door.
[183:55.37]Fuck.
[183:55.83]This crate is blocking the door.
[183:57.67]Oh, god damn it.
[183:59.35]I'm supposed to do something with this rope.
[184:06.06]This crate is blocking the door.
[184:08.88]Where does this go?
[184:12.14]Get off.
[184:20.79]I did it.
[184:23.61]Open the door.
[184:24.29]I broke my leg again.
[184:25.17]I smashed my leg again.
[184:27.75]How many times have I kind of injured my leg in this game?
[184:32.99]Jesus Christ.
[184:35.16]Ah!
[184:37.06]Oh, come on.
[184:37.92]Just get me somewhere where I don't have to worry about a guy with a shotgun for five seconds.
[184:49.40]Just give me a save point.
[184:50.42]A decorative vase.
[184:51.74]Nothing of interest.
[184:52.80]Am I back in the hotel?
[184:53.74]Oh, okay.
[184:56.90]Here's the lady.
[184:57.94]Jack!
[184:58.56]I have to pee.
[184:58.84]You're alive.
[184:59.96]Thank God.
[185:01.47]Just barely.
[185:02.61]The Order has got half this blasted town on my hands.
[185:04.97]Ben with $50 again.
[185:06.39]I warned you, Jack.
[185:07.43]I told you the Order wouldn't stand a chance.
[185:09.87]What is that?
[185:10.59]You found anything more on Brian?
[185:12.69]He never made it out of town.
[185:13.79]Thank you, Ben, for another $50.
[185:15.28]The Order hasn't pulled up in the old jailhouse until he's needed.
[185:19.18]Fifty bucks?
[185:20.94]Another fifty.
[185:22.00]Another fifty, fifty, fifty, hundred, hundred.
[185:24.14]Jesus.
[185:24.70]You are too much, Ben.
[185:25.28]You're the ultimate spoiler.
[185:26.36]You're spoiling me.
[185:41.88]It's out the back of the merchant's bank, just past the old water tower.
[185:45.24]He's at the never trust a purple level.
[185:47.58]The tainted are roaming everywhere.
[185:49.83]He's made it.
[185:50.31]There's a secret crypt under the church that leads out to someplace safe.
[185:54.31]We can use that.
[185:55.93]My father built it when he was minister.
[185:58.19]Crypt under the church.
[185:58.99]Okay, get your father and let's go.
[186:01.73]I can't.
[186:02.61]I mean, he wouldn't pledge himself to Dagon.
[186:06.47]He called it blasphemy.
[186:08.53]The Order found him and, and... Jeez.
[186:12.83]I'm sorry, Rebecca.
[186:14.05]That was clearly Jesus.
[186:15.31]Did your father ever show you how to get into this crypt?
[186:17.27]I guess he didn't want to say that.
[186:18.31]No, but he gave me this.
[186:20.33]I think it'll help.
[186:27.71]She pulled a... We have to leave now.
[186:31.38]She's gonna get killed.
[186:32.34]She's gonna go in the painting.
[186:37.27]Here we go!
[186:41.47]Really?
[186:41.97]Oh no, I... I have to block these doors, don't I?
[186:47.83]Well, stop talking about it and go!
[186:53.42]How about with your hands up?
[187:01.63]She's dead.
[187:04.81]Oh no, she's dead.
[187:07.07]God.
[187:10.99]She's dead.
[187:13.17]Oh, I'm so broken up about this.
[187:16.47]I can't believe it.
[187:17.77]There's no going back now.
[187:21.52]The locals want me dead.
[187:22.56]That's clear enough.
[187:23.24]And they can't afford to let me get away now.
[187:26.54]Even in the sanctuary of the church, I don't feel safe.
[187:28.34]Though it looks like Rebecca was right.
[187:30.16]They're not making any effort to break in like they did at the hotel.
[187:33.66]I'm going to miss her.
[187:37.61]Okay.
[187:39.03]I have a lead on Brian Burnham.
[187:40.89]Rebecca was convinced he's still alive and being held.
[187:42.95]The town's jailhouse.
[187:45.91]But where's the jailhouse?
[187:46.69]According to Rebecca's directions, I need to find the merchant's bank.
[187:50.58]and the water tower.
[187:51.56]In order to reach it... That's easier said than done, though.
[187:54.56]Those things have me pretty much trapped in here.
[187:58.69]Eventually, one of them may think of burning the place down, or they may overcome their fear of the place and come busting in.
[188:03.47]And to find that secret way out, Rebecca said her old man's postcard would help.
[188:08.65]But I don't know how.
[188:10.79]Okay.
[188:13.91]So, old man's postcard.
[188:19.46]An old postcard pierced with four handmade holes.
[188:22.24]There are some strange handwritten instructions on the back.
[188:26.74]That I can't examine.
[188:27.74]I guess they are breaking in.
[188:36.01]Wasn't I just talking about how they're afraid to come in here?
[188:38.97]And now they want to come in.
[188:46.10]It's the minister of the church.
[188:47.70]The pulpit is stained with blood.
[188:50.44]Well, give me the healing.
[188:55.20]Down there.
[188:58.22]Puzzle incoming.
[189:01.98]Here comes a puzzle.
[189:03.86]There's a raised section of tiling in the baptismal pool.
[189:08.48]Photo.
[189:08.70]I'm going to have to move something, right?
[189:13.62]I'm going to have to drag something.
[189:17.10]It's a raised platform.
[189:20.54]This guy's held up by three ropes.
[189:22.88]Cut all the ropes and just drop him into the ocean.
[189:24.94]There's a way to go up.
[189:29.65]At least I can heal.
[189:30.55]Not heal, save.
[189:36.61]Let me see.
[189:37.81]Night Team 14.
[189:39.13]Thank you, Night Team 14, for the $15.10.
[189:41.65]Jerma.

[189:47.99]The Total Distortion video, and you're continuing to be my favorite streamer and YouTuber.
[189:51.35]You deserve more eggs.
[189:54.59]Thank you, Night Team.
[189:56.73]I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
[189:59.68]Hopefully, you all are enjoying yourselves.
[190:04.46]I'm...
[190:06.41]very much keen on that and then of course Ben gave the 50 bucks and Styx Renegade Styx also gave two bucks and said Jorma is the best streamer in the world whether you put the owl bulge like penis bulge thing that everyone you know writes in chat room but thanks a lot guys you deserve more eggs well I don't know I
[190:36.10]I just, I do my best.
[190:37.22]That's all I can say.
[190:38.06]I tried.
[190:39.88]I gotta like play a fucking song.
[190:41.37]I should let the bell finish ringing first.
[191:05.39]Give yourself up, outsider.
[191:06.75]There's no way out of there.
[191:10.11]I think I have to do this like the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, right?
[191:13.19]So what is it?
[191:13.81]Left, right, middle?
[191:17.46]Open these doors, outsider!
[191:20.36]Right?
[191:20.60]Or is the other way around?
[191:25.40]I think it's... How do you do the All-Father?
[191:28.66]I should let the bell finish ringing first.
[191:40.76]I should let the bell finish ringing first.
[191:45.03]I should let the bell finish ringing first.
[191:53.51]Up, up, down, down, left, right.
[191:57.92]Gotta let the... Check the evidence.
[192:03.88]Wait, did it open?
[192:06.67]I think it opened.
[192:07.21]I think I got it.
[192:12.59]I heard something.
[192:13.09]Did I get it?
[192:13.63]I didn't get it.
[192:14.29]I have to heal, too.
[192:15.17]I probably need to look in the journal.
[192:24.68]I mean, what is it?
[192:25.84]It's very clearly...
[192:42.74]If you're willing to come out now!
[192:58.50]Probably closes if you do something wrong.
[192:59.92]Probably.
[193:00.68]Just look at the journal.
[193:01.82]Just to make sure I do it right.
[193:04.18]Uh, that's not it.
[193:05.20]Evidence.
[193:05.60]Postcard.
[193:06.27]Oh, there we go.
[193:07.77]I couldn't just look at it in my fucking inventory?
[193:10.25]On the back of the postcard, there is a handwritten religious verse.
[193:12.59]It must be a coded message.
[193:13.75]It reads, I ring the bells unto thy glory, O Lord, from the lowest unto the highest, and by the sacrament of baptism shall I enter your secrets.
[193:27.24]The postcard must also serve some other purpose.
[193:29.34]It is pierced by four handmade holes, each circled with a number of arrows.
[193:33.24]The arrows seem to signify some sort of order.
[193:38.50]From the lowest onto the highest.
[193:45.56]Just give yourself up, outsider.
[193:47.94]The order will have mercy on your rotten soul.
[193:50.54]So, what is lowest onto the highest?
[193:56.32]Not a nice coded message.
[193:58.00]But there is.
[193:58.84]They're talking about like pitch?
[194:06.82]So it's right, left, middle.
[194:09.85]You can't get away!
[194:25.65]I should let the bell finish ringing first.
[194:29.43]You're trapped.
[194:31.00]There's no place you can run.
[194:32.38]Isn't that it?
[194:40.43]Right, left, middle, right?
[194:43.69]If you're willing to come out now.
[194:45.85]Lowest to highest.
[194:52.59]Just give yourself up, Outsider.
[194:54.75]The Order will have mercy on your rotten soul.
[195:00.42]Oh, they mean like physical location.
[195:03.82]Give yourself up, Outsider.
[195:05.36]Alright, so it's middle... Middle, left, right.
[195:14.40]Open these doors, Outsider!
[195:16.40]I'm not gonna open the doors.
[195:24.70]There it is!
[195:24.94]There it is!
[195:25.18]There it is!
[195:25.46]It's open!
[195:25.74]It's open!
[195:26.12]It's open!
[195:27.06]Go!
[195:27.62]Get... Get down there!
[195:29.58]It's open.
[195:30.12]I think I have to do it again.
[195:31.00]See how it slid open?
[195:37.31]Right?
[195:38.05]You're trapped.
[195:39.01]There's no place you can run.
[195:40.79]I just saw it slide open.
[195:46.03]Is it... Is it... Is that open?
[195:49.28]If you're willing to come out now, we'll not let the gals start this.
[195:54.73]Damn it.
[195:55.33]No, I can hear it closing I'm breaking my fucking leg God damn it this stupid fucking leg break mechanic where you just fall from any height and you break your fucking legs Slowly move down the ladder outsider.
[196:14.64]Oh
[196:32.84]I don't have any healings.
[196:37.24]I have no healings.
[196:38.86]No.
[196:39.80]Whatever.
[196:40.04]Who cares?
[196:49.67]Whatever.
[196:49.89]It's probably something in some other language.
[196:54.52]Not another one of these.
[197:21.55]Dammit, birth 7, 6, baptized 1, died, death 6, 5 buried, 1 lost at sea, marriage is 5.
[197:27.21]So what, like 9?
[197:30.83]Births 12, deaths 243, 235, 3 reported, 7, 3, 2.
[197:35.61]Hmm.
[197:35.69]Well.
[197:51.75]I'm assuming we have to, uh... 342?
[197:52.91]Well, this is 1845, so... 7 or 8.
[197:58.38]No baptisms.
[198:23.88]Okay.
[198:24.04]Let's see.
[198:33.24]Five, three, two.
[198:40.82]Okay, well the only number that shows up three times is marriages.
[198:48.20]Five, three, two?
[198:54.48]It's no use.
[198:55.42]I don't know the combination.
[198:57.44]I'll need the combination before I can open it.
[198:59.24]I can't even guess the combination.
[199:00.42]I can't do it.
[199:00.70]They all appear to be violence on the history of Innsmouth.
[199:03.20]It's no use.
[199:03.98]You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
[199:05.58]You can't even attempt it.
[199:13.10]There's a small stone disk here, hollowed out with the carving of an upside-down cross.
[199:21.66]A small memorial to an old priest.
[199:27.16]I only need an upside down cross.
[199:30.06]Where can I get me one of those?
[199:32.29]The year 1846 has been circled several times.
[199:36.75]Okay.
[199:38.51]All these articles relate to the deaths of Innsmouth citizens.
[199:43.89]What is this?
[199:45.61]A small stone plaque engraved with a series of numbers.
[199:54.05]Oh god dammit.
[199:57.59]Uh, now, I guess I have all the information, now I don't.
[200:00.67]What is this?
[200:01.05]This fucking, bingo!
[200:01.69]Oh, eeshit.
[200:02.19]Okay.
[200:02.41]Alright, so, we got one, seven, five, three.
[200:06.02]So that, okay, so we got one, seven, five, three.
[200:31.27]So I have to go left twice?
[200:37.16]No, because it would be... Yeah, I have to go... The way that a lock works.
[200:45.28]3, 1, and then... Yeah, so it would be 3, 1, 5, 7.
[200:46.47]3, 1, 5, 7.
[201:09.09]Shit!
[201:09.81]I fucked it up.
[201:19.37]I gotta clear it.
[201:20.03]Clear it.
[201:20.49]Clear it.
[201:20.91]Clear the fucking thing.
[201:21.81]Clear it.
[201:22.15]Go to zero.
[201:22.65]Okay, three?
[201:25.93]I was...
[201:37.15]Like, let me be honest with you guys.
[201:39.01]Here's how I'm gonna be honest.
[201:40.03]Listen, listen.
[201:42.21]Do you know the last time I did a fucking padlock like that before?
[201:48.26]You gotta go back like 19 years before I've done something like that.
[201:53.62]Remember, this game came out like fucking 12 fucking years ago.
[201:57.52]This shit doesn't exist anymore.
[202:02.03]I had this on my school locker in high school.
[202:04.45]That's the last time I had to do one of those.
[202:08.60]The safe holds a stone cross.
[202:11.61]You know, in this day and age, you'd hold up like a QR code reader, and it would be like, and it would open.
[202:16.27]Alright, stick it in there.
[202:25.93]I can't move it by hand.
[202:33.42]What do you mean 19, not 90?
[202:34.38]What are you talking about?
[202:35.14]What?
[202:36.42]That not even do anything?
[202:38.87]Oh, thank God.
[202:41.17]You know what I mean?
[202:42.15]Thank God.
[202:43.41]Alright.
[202:51.10]That, okay.
[202:51.64]That's exactly what I expected.
[202:56.31]Can I keep going down?
[202:57.45]Oh, no, that's just... That's just the... That's just the reflection.
[203:01.49]I thought there was a... I thought I found a secret.
[203:03.39]Like, I could keep going down.
[203:04.57]It was just the reflection.
[203:05.47]It's alright.
[203:06.71]Don't worry.
[203:07.25]Everyone's just fucking a little bit... Just a small amount, you know.
[203:11.97]I think I have to follow the little kid laughing.
[203:19.74]You in there?
[203:20.14]Hide and seek.
[203:22.56]Found you.
[203:29.32]So am I like in an asylum or something?
[203:38.58]Here comes a bad joke.
[203:48.65]Wow, that must be Mark Hamill.
[203:52.29]The Last Jedi.
[203:53.39]I got force pushed.
[203:56.17]I told you it wasn't going to be very good.
[204:07.23]You knew.
[204:07.65]I gave you a warning already.
[204:12.56]That was a pretty shitty... Yeah, that was not a good jumpscare.
[204:14.52]It was pretty bad.
[204:23.88]Fresh drugs.
[204:24.64]Click on that staff.
[204:31.88]Add it.
[204:38.91]Mm-hmm Skellington There's a Skellington there When are we gonna get to see Cthulhu?
[204:47.88]Does he show up in this game at all?
[204:51.24]And when do I get my first laser gun?
[204:56.90]The bank 26 February 1999
[205:10.74]Because tonight we're gonna party like it's 1999.
[205:14.22]I broke my fucking leg again.
[205:19.44]I swear to God, guys.
[205:22.24]Getting real tired of that happening.
[205:27.38]Here we go.
[205:29.24]Save it.
[205:33.50]No, there's no Cthulhu in the game.
[205:37.66]Alright, like, honestly...
[205:41.99]I'm... I'm... Honestly... I'm about to stream the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[205:50.39]Then get just permanently banned.
[205:54.87]If I don't see a monster here in, like, the next three to four hours... I'm going to stream the entirety of the Lord of the Rings.
[206:02.30]Every movie.
[206:02.78]What is going on here?
[206:04.02]I wish I could see...
[206:11.61]Some of the planks look weak.
[206:13.35]Of course they do.
[206:16.21]Where am I supposed to go?
[206:17.25]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[206:22.81]I don't understand this.
[206:23.77]Do I have to go across?
[206:25.84]I wish I wasn't doing blurry vision.
[206:30.04]This is not what I was supposed to do.
[206:31.46]At all.
[206:32.98]He's over there!
[206:44.46]I'm just gonna- yeah, I should just load the save.
[207:02.23]Stop getting burnt.
[207:03.55]Oh, you fucking- oh my god.
[207:06.79]What-
[207:21.42]This is not what I'm supposed to be doing.
[207:24.70]I'm stuck on this now.
[207:27.42]Oh lord.
[207:28.18]I just- I wish I could fucking see.
[207:30.18]The major complaint I have for you guys about this fucking game is like just- just like the blurry vision.
[207:38.72]Like can you just do- do you have to have this blurry fucking drunk goggles vision?
[207:46.61]That is so fucking annoying.
[207:49.15]More than anything.
[207:57.70]I think I can actually turn that shit off in like the mod that I downloaded.
[208:05.39]Some of these planks might sound like they might be a little too un-sturdy.
[208:09.49]I better cross my eyes!
[208:17.97]I'm not even entirely sure what the goal here is.
[208:23.43]How high am I supposed to go?
[208:27.22]Out the top?
[208:32.70]Through the door over there?
[208:51.74]So what is the goal?
[208:52.68]What am I trying to accomplish here?
[208:56.72]Why am I up here?
[209:20.40]Go up that?
[209:21.18]I guess we're going up here.
[209:40.09]Some of these planks are weak.
[209:41.09]Don't... Honestly, man, I don't know why you have to keep... Why is he doing this?
[209:48.99]Stop crossing your eyes and just walk.
[209:58.65]That's death.
[210:01.07]And so is that.
[210:02.39]I don't think I could make this jump.
[210:04.49]I don't think I'm not healed enough.
[210:09.27]Well, that was actually very close.
[210:12.38]Spread out, men.
[210:14.26]In the name of the Order of Dagon, I am the Outsider.
[210:18.96]I'm on a pace for record time.
[210:21.53]Okay.
[210:27.09]Insanity.
[210:32.65]I didn't want to fall off that.
[210:33.79]It's gonna break and I'm gonna go, hey!
[210:36.18]Don't jump to that.
[210:37.52]There's the water tower.
[210:39.60]It's gonna break, right?
[210:41.20]I have to jump to this.
[210:42.14]Alright, say your prayers.
[210:44.16]One, two, three, pray.
[210:45.06]Pray.
[210:47.73]Thanks for the prayers.
[210:49.60]You guys really made this happen.
[210:50.70]You did.
[210:51.72]Without at least three of those prayers, nope.
[210:54.74]Wouldn't have happened.
[211:01.08]There's a gold split.
[211:04.31]That's all I do is gold splits, man.
[211:06.85]Nothing else.
[211:09.27]So...
[211:16.74]Down this ladder.
[211:18.10]Should I go down?
[211:18.74]No, I'm stuck on the ladder.
[211:19.90]Get off that, man.
[211:22.11]Over here?
[211:25.81]I guess so.
[211:28.33]This is blurry.
[211:29.85]I'm going to drop down there.
[211:51.33]Jump to this roof?
[211:53.73]Yeah, I'm going here.
[211:57.48]Lots of old storage boxes.
[211:59.78]Nothing useful.
[212:00.54]Search the area.
[212:02.94]Give me the first aid.
[212:06.48]It's right there.
[212:07.12]Lots of old storage boxes.
[212:09.24]Nothing useful.
[212:10.96]Lots of old storage boxes.
[212:12.36]I can see it.
[212:13.26]Nothing useful.
[212:13.92]I can see it.
[212:14.42]It's sitting right on this middle shelf, man.
[212:23.84]Lots of old storage boxes.
[212:25.59]Search the area.
[212:26.79]I don't have full.
[212:28.11]I could heal right now.
[212:29.05]I don't have full, do I?
[212:29.85]I don't think I have any.
[212:34.07]How come I can't heal then?
[212:34.97]I have ten?
[212:35.71]What?
[212:35.85]Search the area.
[212:37.00]When did I get ten?
[212:37.94]And why can I not heal every time I break my leg?
[212:39.76]Spread out.
[212:43.48]Search the area.
[212:46.02]Someone's going to peek at me.
[212:46.92]No.
[212:47.54]It won't open.
[212:52.37]Search the area.
[212:57.85]Oh, this fucking vision.
[213:00.87]Who's the fucking imbecile that thought this was a good idea to put in the whole game?
[213:05.69]I understand, like, insanity and shit, but you know what I don't understand?
[213:09.18]Is hurting the fucking video game player's brain.
[213:18.23]Search the area.
[213:33.07]Here we go.
[213:33.57]What bullets for a gun I don't have.
[213:34.89]Hi.
[213:41.58]Mackie, have you been telling me?
[213:43.62]You could say that.
[213:45.98]Drop me a line next time you plan an audacious, stealthy approach.
[213:50.58]I'll watch and take notes.
[213:52.91]Funny.
[213:53.43]I don't get it, Mackie.
[213:55.11]What's your angle on all of this?
[213:57.25]I already told you.
[213:58.53]I work for the government.
[214:00.19]I've got friends at the top.
[214:02.11]Friends who've invested a lot of time and dough in Innsmouth.
[214:05.47]They don't want to see their investigation set back by some private op turning up the heat with some mindless caper.
[214:12.36]If you mean the burning boy, they're going to kill him, Mackie.
[214:15.64]You know it and I know it.
[214:17.52]I can't let that happen.
[214:19.68]You're not thinking of breaking him out.
[214:21.90]He's just a punk, Jack.
[214:23.95]Where's the jailhouse, Mackie?
[214:26.33]Very well.
[214:27.37]It's your funeral.
[214:28.69]The window over there to your left looks over the jail back alley.
[214:32.31]Is he Cthulhu?
[214:34.60]Saying his name very condescendingly.
[214:39.88]You know what this game could use?
[214:46.29]A GoldenEye 007 karate chop.
[214:54.51]Just like that slow... I would use it on everybody.
[215:00.20]Everything that's gone for sake of town is out to kill me.
[215:01.91]No, Mackie doesn't seem to want me dead, and maybe he has an ulterior motive.
[215:07.57]Am I getting paranoid?
[215:08.62]I need to ignore these distractions if I want to get out here alive.
[215:13.80]My best chance is to find Brian and break him out of the jailhouse.
[215:16.35]To do that, I'll need a plan.
[215:27.58]Cthulhu's a scrawny guy in a business suit.
[215:29.46]But can't he, like, take the form of any man?
[215:33.49]It's just a trash can.
[215:34.73]Isn't Cthulhu, like... Like, I can take the... I can take the form of any man.
[215:40.95]He's a manipulator.
[215:41.67]He's a lawyer.
[215:45.75]He gets what he wants through pure manipulation.
[215:47.86]And there's a guy with a shotgun right here.
[215:54.42]Cthulhu, his fucking funny whistle...
[216:01.56]They are getting more and more monster-like.
[216:06.14]The door is bolted shut.
[216:10.96]The door is bolted shut.
[216:28.67]How did I die?
[216:29.31]Okay.
[216:29.83]That's the window I just came through.
[216:33.24]He bled out.
[216:35.96]That door is bolted shut.
[216:40.34]I think the rats may have killed me, too.
[216:43.10]Can he see me?
[216:44.34]He's looking up here, barely.
[216:46.40]Who's that?
[216:47.56]Hmm, nah, it was alright.
[216:49.02]It was just a guy.
[216:52.52]What?
[216:52.68]The shutters are tightly sealed.
[216:56.80]I just caught Muppet Christmas Carol.
[217:04.16]Rats, rats.
[217:06.60]It's locked.
[217:08.55]It's locked.
[217:09.51]There's no time for that right now.
[217:11.59]It's locked.
[217:13.51]It's locked.
[217:16.75]Messing with the alarm would be too risky.
[217:19.53]This is the jail.
[217:24.03]I'm kind of just running around aimlessly at this point.
[217:32.93]This fucking vision, man.
[217:34.09]I really think I want to go turn this off.
[217:36.82]I want to go disable this shit so bad.
[217:39.04]I just turned off something.
[217:40.20]I don't even know what I turned off.
[217:41.64]He's not going to come in here, is he?
[218:02.63]You can't disable it because it's a feature.
[218:08.27]I probably can.
[218:09.29]I do have that mod.
[218:10.31]I have that game fix mod.
[218:15.18]Those are the cell keys.
[218:16.62]Wait, Brian was in there?
[218:17.46]Brian was in one of those cells.
[218:18.66]Let's hope I don't accidentally die.
[218:31.87]Let me go around the cells.
[218:33.85]God damn it.
[218:34.48]Turn around that way.
[218:40.58]This doll.
[218:41.88]It's unlocked.
[218:42.48]It's Thomas Waits.
[218:42.94]What's he got?
[218:43.62]I thought that was a toothbrush.
[218:56.79]Should I let the crazy guy up?
[218:58.37]I'll tell you what is and isn't a good idea.
[219:02.09]I'm going to hide in the cell for a second.
[219:03.67]Cut his throat with a toothbrush.
[219:25.36]Okay, what's this journal entry?
[219:30.14]Still en route to China, eastward from Otaheite, or Tahiti as it is also called, we have encountered an island that does not appear on our charts.
[219:38.43]I ordered the anchor dropped close inshore.
[219:42.25]How do I prove my loyalty to this guy?
[219:47.58]Is there a certain thing I have to do to this dude?
[219:50.06]So he knows I'm not a threat or a bad guy?
[219:56.49]The islanders are not interested in trading for gold.
[219:58.80]In response to my questioning, I was taken to a smaller island nearby and shown some stone ruins.
[220:26.09]It's a long read.
[220:36.96]Alright, so did I learn anything?
[220:41.10]Should I show him the picture?
[220:41.82]I was like... A photo!
[220:43.62]A photo!
[220:45.68]I got the photo.
[220:46.40]I have a photo.
[220:49.31]Fuck.
[220:56.82]Cthulhu's not in the game.
[220:58.50]He is in the game.
[221:03.23]He goes down that hallway, right?
[221:07.75]I hear two coppers.
[221:10.79]Get out of here, copper!
[221:17.65]Go!
[221:22.43]I will not do as you ask.
[221:25.31]Never.
[221:25.65]Oh, come on.
[221:28.79]I'm not going anywhere until I know I can trust you.
[221:31.81]People, look at this photo.
[221:35.55]There you are.
[221:37.19]Are you Burnham?
[221:38.68]Yeah.
[221:39.56]What do you want?
[221:40.22]I'm here to bust you out of here, my friend.
[221:42.46]Come here, son.
[221:42.92]I'm here to bust you out of this joint.
[221:44.28]I'm a private detective.
[221:46.20]Why should I trust you?
[221:48.04]Ruth Billingham gave me this.
[221:51.19]The guy on the right is distracting.
[221:52.17]This is the photograph I gave her before.
[221:54.00]Oh, damn.
[221:55.70]I've been so foolish.
[221:58.72]If Ruth trusts you, Jack, then so do I. Please hurry and get this door open.
[222:06.28]What are you waiting for?
[222:07.14]It's unlocked.
[222:07.78]Unlock that damn door.
[222:08.40]That's kind of a good shot.
[222:09.33]The village on the main street holds an old automobile.
[222:12.13]It should be able to get us clear of town.
[222:14.72]I think you're currently possessed by Cthulhu.
[222:17.84]How do I lead the way?
[222:19.74]Where am I leading him?
[222:22.56]This guy is, like, possessed himself.
[222:24.18]How do I get out of here?
[222:24.98]This way?
[222:25.34]Lead the way, Jock.
[222:38.82]Then get over here.
[222:39.89]What are you doing?
[222:40.71]What?
[222:40.93]What the fuck?
[222:45.93]Ugh, the game fucking crashed and it's gonna put me so far back.
[223:00.32]How far back is that?
[223:01.84]I don't even know.
[223:44.12]Okay.
[223:46.32]Well.
[223:52.05]Okay, let's go.
[224:04.69]I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
[224:12.26]That's the whole movie.
[224:13.46]That's the entire movie.
[224:15.48]That's the entire Lord of the Rings movie.
[224:22.56]There it is.
[224:25.28]Let's go back to playing Cthulhu.
[224:40.33]That's 30 pages worth of the book.
[224:46.43]Yeah, it's a lot shorter than I thought it was.
[224:48.23]It's only like 9 seconds long, the whole movie, that's great.
[225:05.59]Yeah, we actually- I need to see what happens, like we're about to- Wait a minute, this might be very far away.
[225:12.93]How far- this is extraordinarily far away.
[225:16.35]Oh my god, this is too far away, I think.
[225:21.53]Hold on.
[225:22.33]If I can, like, really speed around this and get the key and break... God damn it.
[225:32.53]Where is this?
[225:33.21]What is this?
[225:34.11]Where is this?
[225:36.57]What?
[225:36.83]What?
[225:37.47]How far away?
[225:38.13]Why is this here?
[225:39.59]Huh?
[225:42.47]Why is this the place that we're back to?
[225:49.03]Wasn't I just in... Wait a minute.
[226:04.02]Wrong save.
[226:04.52]I don't... Oh my god.
[226:09.30]Well, um... That's... That's gonna have to... Can't manually load an autosave.
[226:16.16]Oh my god.
[226:19.29]Well, whatever.
[226:22.05]It's been like four hours or so.
[226:26.47]Let's play the secret game.
[226:28.61]I'm going to do the secret game before I leave.
[226:31.13]Give me a second.
[226:34.41]Give me one minute.
[226:38.93]Just hold your horses.
[226:40.23]I'll be right there.
[226:40.79]Be right back.
[226:41.87]Secret game.
[227:44.13]One sec.
[227:44.90]Hold on.
[228:35.61]The secret game is Clock Tower.
[228:51.40]Wow!
[228:52.26]I am so sorry!
[228:57.64]That was loud!
[229:00.30]I just knocked inside of all your brains.
[229:05.38]Alright, let's go.
[229:10.87]Raised in the granite orphanage, Jennifer and her friends were wanted as adopted daughters.
[229:18.09]They were wanted.
[229:22.54]It happened in September.
[229:24.68]The 21st night of September.
[229:37.57]We were like cigarettes.
[229:43.84]Laura, hurry up.
[229:44.58]We want to be there before sunset.
[229:48.85]Okay.
[229:49.55]Ms.
[229:49.79]Mary?
[229:50.17]Yeah?
[229:54.73]From now on, what kind of place will we be living in?
[229:56.95]A beautiful place.
[230:02.42]That's the fifth time you've asked.
[230:04.50]We take a long time to have a conversation.
[230:06.68]Don't worry.
[230:07.18]It's a very nice place.
[230:13.87]Scoop the poop.
[230:14.63]Hey, we're almost there.
[230:15.23]See?
[230:15.59]Scoop the poop.
[230:16.23]Scoop up the poop.
[230:21.43]That's where we're going to be living.
[230:24.01]Scary.
[230:29.00]We're almost there.
[230:29.88]See?
[230:40.23]What a huge place!
[230:40.85]Yep.
[230:46.36]And?
[230:50.82]I like how Jerma started this so late in the stream that he's not gonna play the game.
[230:55.64]That's not true, it is!
[230:57.79]It's completely true, you're absolutely right.
[231:01.25]The main hall's gigantic.
[231:08.63]I gotta go get Mr. Barrows.
[231:14.33]Everyone wait here.
[231:17.79]All I know about this game is there's a guy with scissors that chase you and try to get you.
[231:20.93]And they're like, didn't they remake the game for like a North American audience?
[231:24.01]This is the original.
[231:33.54]Okay, so.
[231:36.28]I can point and click.
[231:42.25]Let's walk.
[231:44.29]Hey, Anne.
[231:46.47]You want to know what kind of guy Mr. Barrows is?
[231:52.14]Right?
[231:53.14]Yes.
[231:55.22]Hey, Anne.
[231:57.40]Uh, yeah.
[231:59.66]I do want to know what kind of guy he is.
[232:02.06]He's... I do... Yes.
[232:04.00]Yes.
[232:06.58]Well, he's... He's about yay high.
[232:13.63]What is it?
[232:16.65]Is something wrong?
[232:21.03]This house makes me uneasy.
[232:26.30]I'm going to my room.
[232:27.60]Where's the guy with the scissor hands?
[232:36.98]We can't go that way.
[232:38.06]Can I talk to this guy?
[232:42.82]I doubt I'll ever... Next!
[232:44.18]Not yet!
[232:45.76]Next is the end of the stream.
[232:48.87]Heh.
[232:50.53]Lots of paranoid.
[232:51.37]Yeah.
[232:54.29]Find the sprint button.
[232:57.35]Is there a sprint button?
[233:00.15]I'm sure there is.
[233:05.59]I'll go look for her.
[233:06.41]Yes, here we go.
[233:07.75]This is it.
[233:08.49]This is what you came for.
[233:13.72]This is why you guys are here.
[233:30.60]Double click to move?
[233:31.82]It's not doing anything.
[233:35.00]Nobody came for this game.
[233:36.98]You know what?
[233:37.50]I know.
[233:38.38]Look.
[233:39.87]I just have to get up the stairs.
[233:53.30]This is the secret stream!
[233:58.02]We need to go back.
[233:59.40]I need to go in the door.
[234:09.81]Through this door.
[234:10.39]I need to slow down.
[234:13.89]I just have to go through this door.
[234:17.50]There we go, see?
[234:22.04]Keep going.
[234:24.27]Not that way.
[234:32.85]Okay, girls.
[234:36.63]Come on, this isn't funny.
[234:37.69]This just got going.
[234:44.15]Somebody just hit the brakes outside on the highway.
[234:52.63]There's the run.
[234:53.49]There's run.
[234:54.19]Okay, run.
[234:55.17]Let's run.
[234:58.15]Where am I going?
[235:04.76]In here?
[235:05.02]No, what are you... You fucking idiot.
[235:14.70]Go.
[235:18.71]Wrong way?
[235:19.09]What do you mean, wrong way?
[235:21.07]I'm running away from the danger.
[235:22.49]I'm not going to get myself killed.
[235:27.01]I'm going as far away as possible.
[235:34.02]Alright, that means the bad guy's near.
[235:35.42]Where the hell am I?
[235:50.21]That's Anne!
[235:52.48]Oh, God.
[235:53.06]Okay, we have to go this way.
[235:55.56]It's just... It's just Donald Trump with a pair of scissors.
[236:02.94]What about up here?
[236:03.54]I don't know which way to go.
[236:07.63]He's... Where is he?
[236:08.15]Where is he?
[236:08.49]He's... Ah!
[236:11.63]Go, go!
[236:12.13]Wait, did I just grab it with my bare hands?
[236:15.33]He said, yippee!
[236:16.43]I got you!
[236:20.65]This is already scary.
[236:21.95]Alright, go, go.
[236:27.65]Run, run.
[236:31.92]I don't know where I'm running to.
[236:32.82]Up here.
[236:41.62]Believe me, let me tell you something.
[236:44.09]You see these scissors?
[236:45.49]They're gigantic scissors.
[236:46.71]Beautiful big scissors.
[236:48.87]I'm gonna cut you.
[236:49.79]I'm gonna... What?
[236:52.07]Hey.
[236:56.33]Why am I tripping every time?
[237:00.09]Oh, you just fall down.
[237:01.43]Okay, I get it.
[237:05.14]It seems that that door is locked.
[237:07.26]Ow, that's loud.
[237:14.05]No, go this way.
[237:16.05]I think the more damage you take... Yeah, let's go in here.
[237:21.67]Where's the healing salve?
[237:25.29]Door seems to be stuck.
[237:27.09]Great.
[237:36.66]Go, go, go.
[237:38.68]Go.
[237:39.00]Why are you taking so long?
[237:44.07]In here.
[237:45.19]Inside the confessional.
[237:50.01]In here?
[237:50.88]Yeah.
[237:51.08]We're going to go in this room.
[237:53.60]If she would stop this.
[237:54.64]If you just go.
[237:55.70]No, no, no, no.
[237:56.46]Stop skidding around.
[237:57.32]What is this?
[237:57.70]Mario Kart?
[237:58.82]Stop drifting and go back.
[238:06.23]Right here.
[238:06.55]There we go.
[238:14.87]Open the fridge.
[238:18.26]Oh, God.
[238:20.82]Let me tell you something.
[238:22.58]No collusion.
[238:23.97]No obstruction.
[238:25.73]He's a leaker.
[238:26.81]And I'll prove it to you.
[238:27.95]Just stand still.
[238:29.07]How do I get up?
[238:45.26]You're just a couple of humans.
[238:49.54]Incoming collusion in three, two, one, action.
[238:56.39]Okay, that's gonna be the end of the stream.
[238:58.77]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[239:04.51]Dead end.
[239:06.47]That's it.
[239:08.42]This game's actually fun.
[239:14.66]It was your secret video game.
[239:18.14]That's the end of the stream.
[239:21.15]Round two?
[239:21.81]No.
[239:23.25]We ended it.
[239:26.13]How was it?
[239:26.51]Fun?
[239:27.45]Super Nintendo.
[239:28.37]1995.
[239:28.47]I got jump scared.
[239:34.12]You saw it.
[239:41.08]I should have played that instead.
[239:43.42]Yeah.
[239:44.92]Well, Call of Cthulhu doesn't seem like a bad game.
[239:47.74]It's just... It's just a little old.
[239:51.74]There was some fun there.
[239:52.76]There was some fun in there.
[239:54.31]I'll tell you, there was.
[239:57.51]But I think tomorrow... Tomorrow... Tomorrow, I love you tomorrow.
[240:05.63]We're gonna... We're gonna play...
[240:10.21]Probably Assassin's Creed Origins.
[240:11.87]I keep seeing it.
[240:12.51]It's like an open world.
[240:13.37]I feel like there's a lot of fun to be had there.
[240:15.63]Even if the game sucks, we're only going to play it for one night anyway, so who cares?
[240:21.75]And look, if Assassin's Creed Origins is like a piece of shit and it's not fun and like an hour goes by and we hate it, then we can always just go back and play Vampire the Masquerade Ball.
[240:35.38]So we have plenty of options.
[240:36.38]I have a lot of
[240:37.62]options so don't worry we'll be good I have to buy the 800 collectors edition uh I'm not sure I'm gonna do that you know but regardless it's time to uh
[241:07.89]Time to go.
[241:12.51]See you guys tomorrow.

[242:10.10]I did it earlier.
[242:10.70]Fucking wear the rats.

[242:27.72]And that's it.
[242:28.40]Thank you to Ben Elnor for the huge amount of money, Jaico for the huge amount of money, Aldolfo for the huge amount of money.
[242:36.85]There was a ton of people that gave more than $50 to $100 tonight.
[242:40.15]You guys are fucking too much.
[242:41.23]You really are.
[242:46.24]And I might actually, I don't know, I might try to do something that I've been talking about, at least with my mods, on Friday.
[242:55.00]Friday might be a stream that's not a video game.
[242:59.56]Might be something weird.
[243:01.02]Because I've been talking about that for like fucking months and I want to get it done.
[243:04.43]Should be a lot of fun.
[243:10.31]Ofas!
[243:10.95]Ofas!
[243:11.79]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[243:12.83]I highly recommend you play Scooby-Doo for SNES for a good Halloween game.
[243:18.81]Is that for real?
[243:22.57]Is that real of us?
[243:23.47]Is there a Scooby-Doo video game for SNES?
[243:28.31]I will sleep with it.
[243:29.19]I will go to bed with it in bed.
[243:31.19]So I can absorb its power.
[243:35.17]Cooking stream?
[243:35.87]No, not a cooking stream.
[243:36.78]I'm going to be building a computer on stream.
[243:40.16]I've been talking about it.
[243:41.16]I've been saying I want to do it.
[243:45.42]PC build stream.
[243:47.18]Where I build a PC.
[243:47.96]PC.
[243:50.54]I'm going to teach you guys the do's and don'ts of building a computer.
[243:58.22]That's going to be... I want to make it educational.
[244:06.25]I've been talking about this for months with people, and I'm going to try to get it done.
[244:12.49]Boring?
[244:13.11]Well, you probably should go.
[244:14.33]Because if you think it's boring, I've got news for you, it ain't going to be.
[244:22.67]I'm going to be so impatient.
[244:24.05]Don't worry.
[244:25.45]People can be as impatient as they want to be.
[244:29.29]I'm going to build the best PC that you ever will ever see.
[244:37.37]If it becomes a shirtless PC build stream, I'll be ready.
[244:40.90]Well, you have to be shirtless.
[244:42.08]Because, you know, there's static electricity.
[244:44.86]You can't wear any clothes.
[244:45.74]You have to be naked.
[244:47.52]You can't even wear socks when you build a computer.
[244:49.28]Did you guys know that?
[244:50.90]You have to be bare skin naked.
[244:54.36]You'll build up static.
[244:55.34]You'll fry your motherboard.
[244:57.08]No.
[244:58.33]If you go into Geek Squad and you tell them to build a computer, all the guys behind the counter are naked.
[245:02.47]Have you ever been to a Geek Squad?
[245:05.63]The only reason why they have those dumb fucking black and white shirt and tie with the pants is because it's a commercial.
[245:11.04]They can't be naked on TV.
[245:12.14]They're all naked back there.
[245:13.52]All of them.
