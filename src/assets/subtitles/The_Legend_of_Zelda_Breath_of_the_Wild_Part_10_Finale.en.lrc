[00:50.33]What's up?
[00:52.55]I've seen a lot of people in chat that were... Maybe in a betting mood?
[00:58.11]Potentially?
[00:58.59]One of the mods told me.
[01:04.89]If you don't know... You're just getting here.
[01:08.23]Today is a very, very, very special day for a lot of people here.
[01:14.06]Today is the day... That I beat... Breath of the Wild.
[01:20.55]Wow, didn't think you're going to hear that on a Sunday afternoon, did you?
[01:28.39]It's been about four months.
[01:29.93]I think the last time was what?
[01:31.60]May?
[01:32.18]April?
[01:34.92]So I haven't played in four months.
[01:36.58]I got one divine.
[01:38.48]It's been five months.
[01:41.02]Whatever.
[01:41.32]It's been more like six.
[01:46.27]Well, alright, here's the thing.
[01:47.87]I've got one more divine beast.
[01:52.46]kill that bastard wait no you don't kill them it's been like five months since I played this we become friends I'm not gonna we're not killing any divine beasts I haven't I forgot that that was okay I forgot everything apparently we're gonna team up with the divine beast to take out ganon that's better but uh I asked how long this would take to do
[02:23.21]If I beat the Divine Beast, I become friends with the Divine Beast.
[02:31.54]Then go right to Ganon.
[02:33.42]Could I do it in three hours?
[02:36.46]And that is what you'll be betting on today.
[02:39.42]We'll see if I can do it.
[02:42.71]Can I beat this game in under three hours?
[02:45.87]Three hours in one second.
[02:49.07]Absolutely not.
[02:50.09]I'm seeing a few absolutely nots.
[02:52.85]No way.
[02:53.39]No way.
[02:53.91]Absolutely not.
[02:57.67]Well, I'm going to try anyways.
[02:58.93]How long are you going to be live for?
[03:03.37]I don't know.
[03:03.67]That's a good question.
[03:09.73]Alright, so if I don't get there in three hours, this is the last time I'm ever going to play Breath of the Wild.
[03:16.23]So it's either I beat the game or not.
[03:18.81]I have to.
[03:19.55]I'm confident I'll do it.
[03:24.90]No chance.
[03:27.36]That's kind of okay.
[03:28.18]What if I get to the front door of Ganon and I aim the magical holy bow and I'm about to shoot the first shot and it's three hours goes up and I exit the game.
[03:44.19]That'd be kind of funny.
[03:44.75]Yeah, but after this I'm going to play Breath of the Wild for at most three hours.
[03:57.11]Then we're going to move on.
[03:58.91]I want to play Punch Out.
[04:00.58]I want to play GoldenEye too.
[04:04.22]GoldenEye, they re-released it.
[04:06.36]They made it HD.
[04:07.76]Well, they didn't make it HD graphics, but they made it, upscaled it, right?
[04:13.22]I want to play a bunch of Switch stuff.
[04:15.22]It's plugged in.
[04:16.14]It's being captured.
[04:16.98]So I'm going to do it.
[04:21.31]So what do you think?
[04:22.49]Should we go for a countdown?
[04:24.91]Wait, I need to get ready first.
[04:30.59]It's got a huge raid.
[04:31.49]Right at the very beginning.
[04:36.83]Holy shit, thanks for the raid.
[04:43.80]There's over 2000 people.
[04:45.76]What's up?
[04:48.08]Is it K4?
[04:49.52]Thanks for the raid, K4.
[04:56.68]Welcome everybody.
[04:57.16]That's a lot of people.
[05:01.44]We're going to be playing Breath of the Wild.
[05:05.02]Facecam off.
[05:07.08]No, no facecam.
[05:10.45]Put a timer up.
[05:11.25]Yeah, well, don't worry.
[05:12.79]We'll make sure we're very honest about this.
[05:20.53]Facecam or Riot.
[05:22.99]Well.
[05:23.19]Ain't going to be one, so that's too bad.
[05:33.31]Why does it have to be three hours exactly?
[05:34.87]Because I think that's in pre-stream chat, that's where we kind of all were like, well, some people said it's you, so it'll be five hours.
[05:44.89]But I disagree.
[05:46.49]I think I can do it in three.
[05:48.99]And I'm not rushing to do this, but I kind of am.
[05:52.19]Because I keep putting off Breath of the Wild.
[05:54.95]I keep saying I'm going to play it.
[05:55.95]I keep saying, hey, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
[05:57.55]I just don't do it.
[06:00.45]I have to give myself a timer.
[06:04.84]Plus, that's kind of fun.
[06:08.52]I'm going to fall off the horse a hundred times in three hours and I'm not going to make any progress.
[06:11.86]So don't worry.
[06:14.45]Those of you that are betting if I can see.
[06:16.21]Alright.
[06:16.55]Is it just see the end credits in three hours?
[06:24.85]He hates this game.
[06:29.37]No, dude, I love Breath of the Wild.
[06:31.71]Zelda, let's go.
[06:33.29]Yeah, it's so much fun.
[06:34.43]I'm going to give myself a three-hour timer to finish this game, and I'm never playing it ever again.
[06:40.49]Oh, Nintendo, let's go.
[06:45.33]Why give myself a timer?
[06:46.44]I think it's just fun.
[06:49.76]You guys ready?
[06:50.98]It's the last hit on the final boss.
[06:53.04]Okay, so by the way, today is the backseat dream.
[06:59.51]I don't want to name emote only ever.
[07:02.29]I'm going to be looking for solutions.
[07:03.63]I'm going to be asking for help.
[07:04.83]I'm going to say, hey, what's the best product I could use right now?
[07:09.13]And I expect help.
[07:10.11]I expect to get through this.
[07:10.99]We're looking for the best products.
[07:14.88]We're looking for the best equipment.
[07:18.80]That's cheating.
[07:19.44]That's fine.
[07:22.54]Are we ready?
[07:23.00]Are we ready to play this?
[07:25.92]So I get five minutes of streamer learn how to play the whole game again because you haven't played it in six months.
[07:33.72]I get five minutes to run around in a circle and jump.
[07:36.18]You understand?
[07:36.66]Okay.
[07:41.23]I get that.
[07:44.17]So that timer, I'm just going to run around in a circle for a few minutes.
[07:47.45]No emote only, all backseating.
[07:49.97]Yeah.
[07:50.73]You can backseat as much as you want.
[07:53.81]Okay, let me remember how to play.
[07:56.92]That's jump.
[07:58.04]We're going.
[07:59.18]Alright, that's jump.
[08:01.30]Isn't there a triple jump?
[08:02.24]Can't you go like... I'm just trying to make as much people leave as possible in the first ten minutes.
[08:11.83]I'm just trying to get as many people to leave as possible in the first five minutes.
[08:16.25]I said the same thing twice.
[08:20.93]No, that... Wait, that's in Tears of the Kingdom?
[08:28.43]Alright, the timer does not start until I say it does, okay?
[08:33.71]And we're going to keep... I have a... I'm keeping track over here.
[08:36.09]Alright, that's... This is sprint.
[08:39.52]This is slash.
[08:40.46]Okay, I got... I got the master sword last time.
[08:43.84]This thing is unbreakable, right?
[08:50.13]Just put a timer on screen.
[08:51.79]I don't want to put a timer on screen because I feel like it'll ruin the VOD.
[08:58.35]Okay, every VOD before this did not have a three hour timer.
[09:01.46]And the people that watch the VODs and they're just trying to hang out and just chill like, oh, cool.
[09:05.84]What's this timer on the screen?
[09:07.04]I want to watch the streamer play Breath of the Wild.
[09:09.38]What is this?
[09:11.40]No, he ruined it.
[09:12.20]He ruined the playthrough.
[09:13.36]You ruined the playthrough.
[09:16.01]I don't want to hear that.
[09:20.85]Alright, that's how you... Right, I got the freezing, I got the camera, I've got the magnet.
[09:26.15]That's a jump.
[09:27.31]That's a swing.
[09:28.01]The Master Sword can't be broken.
[09:29.39]Thank God we finally got it.
[09:30.66]Alright, so this is the Thunder Blade.
[09:34.84]So, if this is going to be truly the last Breath of the Wild stream... You better believe I'm going to be throwing these at people.
[09:41.82]I'm going to be... This is awesome.
[09:43.35]I'm so happy about this.
[09:46.31]Me saying this is the last time I'm going to play Breath of the Wild...
[09:50.99]Now the whole... Everything is now open now.
[09:53.26]I'm just gonna use this weapon because I feel like it.
[09:56.94]That's so awesome.
[09:57.92]I'm so happy about that.
[09:58.88]I don't even care.
[10:00.94]I don't even know what this is.
[10:01.72]I'm gonna use it now.
[10:04.14]I finally am... I'm gonna... I'm allowed to use all these weapons because I know it's the last time I'm gonna play it.
[10:11.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:12.48]The timer started?
[10:15.43]Wait, the timer.
[10:15.81]Oh, wait, wait.
[10:16.91]The timer started.
[10:17.75]Hold on.
[10:17.91]Alright, I know how to jump.
[10:20.01]Alright, alright, alright.
[10:22.39]Here's what I need to do.
[10:25.60]Oh, wait.
[10:26.08]Let me turn this in first.
[10:27.00]This is a quest here.
[10:30.36]No, no 3, 2, 1, go.
[10:31.66]Hold on.
[10:31.96]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:34.98]435?
[10:38.67]Let me turn this down.
[10:39.35]No, I have to turn this quest in.
[10:42.05]Hmm.
[10:44.08]A lot of people don't think I'm gonna do this.
[10:45.64]I cannot wait until you all get this completely wrong.
[10:50.88]Skip the dialog?
[10:52.41]No, it hasn't officially started yet.
[10:55.37]You want a different outcome this time?
[10:56.61]Okay.
[10:57.41]Alright.
[10:59.35]I think we have a cutscene here.
[11:04.05]I am not gonna fail.
[11:07.26]Okay, how strange.
[11:09.78]Please beat it, please.
[11:10.62]Please.
[11:15.38]I give you five extra minutes.
[11:16.80]Oh, okay.
[11:17.34]No, we're good.
[11:17.80]We're good.
[11:21.46]You wore that champion's tunic every day.
[11:23.00]I feel as though I've been transported in time.
[11:25.55]Link, our princess, you must rescue her.
[11:27.37]Alright, so where's the... What is this a quest for?
[11:32.31]I'm really glad you gave me that extra time.
[11:34.77]You may not remember your last meeting with Ganon, but it did not end well for you.
[11:39.46]Why is this a quest?
[11:42.42]Upstairs?
[11:43.55]Backseat as much as possible, by the way.
[11:47.65]The shit that would get you banned in other chats of just like telling me where to go... Oh, I want it all.
[11:52.91]I want to see... I want anything that you would... We're talking backseat is open.
[11:57.04]The floodgates are completely open.
[12:02.24]I want exact coordinates to every single encounter.
[12:07.71]What is this quest?
[12:13.46]Captured memories.
[12:15.66]What is this?
[12:18.48]Captured memories.
[12:19.78]Princess Zelda left behind an album with 12 pictures in it.
[12:23.66]Traveling to the places shown in these pictures may help you regain your memories.
[12:27.56]What?
[12:30.02]Why is this?
[12:31.28]Oh, that was like set as a destination.
[12:32.80]I just wasted five minutes.
[12:36.08]Why was that set as a destination?
[12:38.62]Okay, what time is it?
[12:39.40]Alright, we haven't even started yet.
[12:45.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[12:45.92]Go back, go back, go back.
[12:46.90]Ignore everything, but go to the top left of the map.
[12:49.26]Ignore this.
[12:49.74]Alright, where's the beast?
[12:54.81]The next beast is not on the map.
[12:56.79]Where is the beast?
[13:01.07]Top left, top left, top left.
[13:02.35]Alright.
[13:04.64]Like up here.
[13:05.06]Fastest way to get there.
[13:08.20]Fastest way to get there.
[13:10.14]Ignore the beast, go right to Ganon.
[13:11.60]No, I want to... I got three hours.
[13:14.42]The timer hadn't even started yet.
[13:19.35]Go west, go west, go west.
[13:21.25]Central tower.
[13:23.07]Right here.
[13:23.31]Let's go.
[13:26.23]Alright, let the... Timer starts now.
[13:30.14]Wait, yeah, in exactly three hours from right now, I plan on seeing the ending credits of Breath of the Wild.
[13:38.94]In exactly three hours, exactly.
[13:48.87]Try to use the horse.
[13:50.93]I actually should get a horse.
[13:51.93]Because Frank 2 is somewhere.
[13:54.51]I didn't cook any food.
[13:55.45]Alright, that's where I need to end up, right?
[13:57.18]So we need to go this way.
[14:00.70]Stable right here.
[14:03.56]Stable right there.
[14:04.38]I want the horse.
[14:12.84]Is that another raid?
[14:13.68]That's like two huge raids back to back.
[14:23.29]Activate the Divine Beast quest, dude.
[14:25.67]I don't have the Divine Beast quest on?
[14:27.11]Alright, that was P.S.
[14:32.73]Pig.
[14:33.17]P.S.
[14:33.81]P1G.
[14:34.79]P.S.
[14:35.48]P. Big.
[14:37.98]I don't read, I can't read names ever.
[14:39.52]I think, is that what it is?
[14:43.26]Is that, did I say it wrong?
[14:45.22]It looks different over here.
[14:46.38]It looks different over here.
[14:47.82]It looks different over here.
[14:49.62]I fucked up big time, didn't I?
[14:51.65]I fucked up big time.
[14:53.35]It says, it looks like, okay, PS1, PSP1G.
[14:59.51]I'm so sorry.
[15:00.41]That's not how your name is said.
[15:01.71]That's what it looks like over here on my other screen.
[15:03.53]I'm really sorry.
[15:04.57]But you're fucking awesome for rating me.
[15:06.39]Appreciate it.
[15:13.48]Stop wasting time.
[15:14.36]I'm not wasting time.
[15:15.54]I'm apologizing.
[15:22.77]What a PR disaster.
[15:26.41]What?
[15:26.61]I need... I need a horse.
[15:35.05]Oh, I'm never going to do this in three hours.
[15:36.79]I hope you bet accordingly.
[15:38.26]God damn it.
[15:46.32]Those are two huge raids, though.
[15:47.38]Thanks.
[15:47.70]Welcome, everybody.
[15:50.36]Alright, let's go.
[15:51.12]We want Frank.
[15:53.40]Where's Frank 2?
[15:57.53]At this point, I don't know, but I need a horse and we're taking Frank.
[16:03.65]Frank 2 died.
[16:04.43]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[16:21.41]God damn it.
[16:28.49]Frank too soft retired.
[16:30.37]Alright, let me turn the quest on.
[16:38.72]Okay, divine beast.
[16:45.18]Captured.
[16:45.74]Right, free the divine beasts.
[16:49.81]It's all the way up here.
[16:50.87]Why am I going this way?
[16:51.71]Why would I not go over here?
[16:52.55]Oh, I wanted the horse.
[16:55.83]I can go this way.
[16:56.39]Should I go up the road?
[17:00.39]Just follow the road.
[17:01.42]Trust.
[17:01.88]Trust.
[17:02.14]Just follow the road.
[17:02.84]Go, go, go.
[17:05.96]This way.
[17:07.70]I need to cook food, too.
[17:10.04]Trust, trust, trust.
[17:11.10]Get some ancient arrows.
[17:13.20]Um... I'm just going.
[17:15.34]That's not the button to ride the horse.
[17:24.70]That's the first time I've seen two just big raids back-to-back, though.
[17:28.06]Honestly, like, all jokes aside, thanks, guys.
[17:31.36]Or when I started the stream.
[17:39.35]This is the easiest Divine Beast.
[17:40.83]You definitely can do it.
[17:42.89]Alright, well, I also don't want to miss any shrines, either.
[17:45.32]That's my favorite part of the whole game.
[17:50.85]There is no way you do this in three hours.
[17:54.01]Oh, I hope you bet for it.
[18:05.58]Trines, no shot three hours.
[18:07.54]I can do it.
[18:09.86]Guys, it hasn't even been two minutes.
[18:13.64]I've got a lot of those minutes lined up in a row.
[18:20.64]And I have the horse this time.
[18:21.66]The first time in the playthrough I've actually used the horse in more than five minutes.
[18:29.12]People right now are pissed that I actually went to the stable.
[18:34.32]He's been running the entire game.
[18:37.08]It's this time that he now uses the horse.
[18:39.40]Alright, so where is it?
[18:47.10]It's so far away.
[18:54.09]What the hell is that?
[18:56.65]Look at the sky.
[18:57.39]Alright, I crashed into a tree.
[19:11.34]Alright, there's nothing here.
[19:32.88]Is there no tower like right here?
[19:34.06]Hold on.
[19:34.38]It has to be.
[19:42.49]This is a huge mountain.
[19:50.51]Follow the road.
[19:51.33]That fox did a backflip.
[19:59.27]Oh my God, I didn't mean to.
[20:08.07]Hold on a second.
[20:08.59]You don't think I'm going to stop to get this stuff?
[20:12.67]This stuff is still worth it.
[20:15.30]I need to make food as well.
[20:16.74]I'm going to stop at whatever the next town is.
[20:23.70]You laughed at him.
[20:27.83]That was a crazy scenario.
[20:29.19]I didn't mean to.
[20:30.51]Alright.
[20:32.61]Give me a tower.
[20:39.76]Maybe I should just get up high and just look.
[20:47.48]Hold on a second.
[20:52.75]Look at that.
[20:56.71]I've seen this thing before.
[20:57.59]Can I get a picture of this thing?
[21:05.53]I'm going to take a picture of that.
[21:14.18]Oh, I think I already did take a picture of this.
[21:17.04]I could get a much better picture, though.
[21:21.16]Nice!
[21:24.90]Wait.
[21:25.90]This one's better.
[21:26.32]No, get it!
[21:37.23]Ugh!
[21:43.17]No, it has to be like touching his face.
[21:46.67]Whatever.
[21:47.56]Game sucks.
[21:59.51]These are the easiest bits I ever made?
[22:01.45]Wait, what do you mean?
[22:04.77]Wait, you can't bet bits and get bits back.
[22:08.93]You mean channel points.
[22:12.58]I can't move, hold on.
[22:16.55]What's wrong with the horse?
[22:21.53]Why is the horse not moving?
[22:22.41]OK, I don't know what's going on, but I can't go that way.
[22:31.85]Alright, you come to me then.
[22:43.58]There we go.
[22:48.76]How much time is left?
[22:51.25]I need even ten minutes!
[22:52.85]Okay, I need... Help!
[23:02.01]I need backseaters right now.
[23:03.41]Help!
[23:04.77]Where do I go?
[23:06.34]I don't see a tower anywhere.
[23:07.28]Wait a minute.
[23:16.34]How do I do the point thing again?
[23:52.03]I can't.
[23:52.35]Whatever.
[23:52.65]I'm going that way.
[24:11.60]I should have bet if you were going to beat this Divine Beast in three hours.
[24:15.10]I just saw the Divine Beast.
[24:17.96]It's right there.
[24:18.56]I found it.
[24:20.34]I'm good.
[24:21.30]Settle down.
[24:26.29]You know what?
[24:26.58]Why did I bring the horse?
[24:27.32]I like to glide.
[24:31.37]What was the point of the horse?
[24:32.61]I should have just glid.
[24:33.23]Does that work?
[25:00.76]I glid.
[25:01.30]That's correct, right?
[25:19.84]Glowed.
[25:21.66]Glided?
[25:22.30]I glided over there.
[25:24.99]I glid over there.
[25:33.30]over there.
[25:33.66]I glid over there.
[25:35.32]I glidded over there.
[25:40.99]How'd you get over there?
[25:41.55]Well, I had to glide.
[25:42.23]I glid.
[25:45.69]Wait, am I going the... Okay, I'm going the right way now.
[25:59.45]I want to get a big picture of everything over here because there's not a tower like here anywhere.
[26:03.75]Can I stand up here?
[26:11.29]Yes, I can.
[26:13.90]I'm going for the glide.
[26:18.56]Forget about the horse.
[26:20.24]I can cover three miles with the glider in a tenth of the time it takes to ride with the horse.
[26:30.70]And I get special mushrooms.
[26:43.95]Okay.
[26:45.17]Should get there.
[26:45.63]I'm good.
[26:46.17]I want a big picture of everything going on here.
[26:55.73]Shrine right there.
[26:56.61]I'm going to ignore it for now.
[27:01.32]What else is up here?
[27:09.42]Okay, tower that way.
[27:14.42]Tower over there.
[27:15.14]I think that's the closest tower for sure.
[27:21.67]You should get the shrine so you can travel.
[27:23.31]Now that person is smart.
[27:25.33]And I know, I get it.
[27:26.75]That's a good idea.
[27:27.45]But I know why you just told me to do that.
[27:28.77]Because you're trying to burn like 40 minutes in that shrine.
[27:32.74]And I'm going to have to say no.
[27:38.60]Can I get the horse over here?
[27:45.35]At least, oh no.
[27:47.58]Alright, so if I head that way, this is... That's definitely going the right direction.
[27:52.69]It is.
[27:52.89]Alright, let's start the glider.
[27:59.23]I'm covering miles right now.
[28:00.56]Did you go over that, uh, the bridge?
[28:10.71]No, I'm not, I, uh-uh.
[28:16.82]I'll get the shrine because it is fast travel, but let me just take a look what's in there.
[28:22.88]I'm not going to do it.
[28:23.40]I just want to look.
[28:39.57]Okay.
[28:44.67]Let's get to the fast travel.
[28:48.07]Alright, there's one right there, too.
[28:50.85]Which one is closer?
[28:51.53]Probably that one.
[28:52.09]That's also in the right direction, so we're going that way.
[28:57.64]You get sidetracked so easily.
[29:00.30]Isn't that the whole point of Breath of the Wild, though?
[29:02.92]Isn't Breath of the Wild the game to get sidetracked in, out of all games?
[29:06.86]Alright, it's activated.
[29:10.50]I don't want to even see what's in there.
[29:13.05]There's one over there, too.
[29:15.47]Let me mark that.
[29:23.88]Uh, alright, I'm gonna mark it as a treasure chest.
[29:26.38]Is that even correct?
[29:29.61]Bro, that's not even the right way.
[29:31.37]I'm gonna fuck myself over so bad if that's still here.
[29:35.13]It's... here?
[29:36.17]I don't even know what the... Alright, I placed the other markers five months ago.
[29:43.81]I don't even know what they're for.
[29:45.66]They're probably really important, though.
[29:50.92]I placed that...
[29:54.10]Okay.
[29:55.00]I placed that red marker back in, I want to say, April or March of this year or something.
[30:02.57]Take all my clothes off quick!
[30:04.39]I'm going to get struck by lightning.
[30:09.93]What do I do?
[30:13.31]What do I do?
[30:13.95]How do I take this off?
[30:16.43]Unequip?
[30:19.15]How do I just unequip something?
[30:28.09]Okay, we're good.
[30:29.67]See?
[30:29.95]That was right there.
[30:33.01]Okay, I think I'm good.
[30:34.45]I'm gonna head that way and we're gonna get to the tower.
[30:41.46]Uh, wait.
[30:42.00]Hold on, there's something here.
[30:44.86]Stables.
[30:45.22]Oh, hell yeah.
[30:47.44]What the fuck?
[30:48.24]Oh my god.
[30:49.14]Can this hit them?
[30:56.21]Wait, I can cook.
[31:00.35]I'm not gonna take very much time doing this.
[31:04.19]I know that people are like, oh my god, dude, this is such shit food.
[31:06.95]It doesn't matter.
[31:07.47]I just need to eat it.
[31:10.49]Salt and jalapeños, whatever this is.
[31:17.44]Ooh.
[31:20.12]Okay, do I have any meat or anything?
[31:27.51]Mushroom.
[31:29.37]Okay, what is the thing I have to be worried about up here?
[31:32.50]Is it electricity?
[31:33.30]Is it wind?
[31:34.22]Is it fire?
[31:35.56]What's the thing?
[31:36.36]It's cold.
[31:37.10]Cold areas?
[31:37.78]It's cold.
[31:38.14]Okay, I need to get cold resistant stuff.
[31:43.56]Okay, so this is good for cold.
[31:46.54]So let's go with this.
[31:49.74]What about this one?
[31:51.25]Stamina?
[31:57.95]Uh, stealth?
[31:58.76]Maybe just, uh, like a watermelon?
[32:01.32]Heat resistance?
[32:02.00]I don't think I have very much ingredients, do I?
[32:05.32]I need more meat.
[32:14.88]Banana?
[32:18.20]Different effects don't stack.
[32:20.03]That's right.
[32:21.17]Um, what does this do?
[32:24.59]So, hold on.
[32:27.36]uh stop holding should I just get uh you have an unsorted inventory okay so it's sorted now so should I just do five of these just one two three four five and just have like a bunch of low level um what do you guys think just that's what I got just one two three four five with some salt
[32:53.39]Should I add salt or just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[32:55.19]Backseat.
[32:56.33]Now.
[32:57.05]Please.
[32:59.93]Put one wing in there.
[33:01.39]No salt, just five.
[33:05.44]Let's see what it does.
[33:11.22]10 minutes?
[33:11.60]12 minutes?
[33:13.32]Okay.
[33:14.22]That's 12 minutes of low-level cold resistance.
[33:19.28]Is that going to be good enough for what happens up here?
[33:27.20]That's really all you need?
[33:28.04]Okay.
[33:30.72]Because this will give us like 30 minutes.
[33:38.41]I suppose to.
[33:40.65]How much money do I have?
[33:44.31]I'm gonna... Okay, I think that's alright for now.
[33:48.02]So let me get the horse.
[33:50.46]And... How far away am I from the... That thing there?
[33:58.23]It's not that far.
[33:59.20]Alright, I'm gonna unlock that.
[34:03.56]And then I'm gonna get the horse.
[34:05.84]I need to reveal the map.
[34:07.48]Look, it's over there.
[34:09.74]I'm getting close.
[34:19.43]I need this.
[34:21.73]Get the horse now.
[34:24.28]I feel like I'm... Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[34:25.70]I'm gonna get the horse, we're gonna go across this bridge, and I'm gonna abandon the horse to climb the side of the mountain up there.
[34:31.00]Happens every time.
[34:31.62]I'll try it, though.
[34:41.41]How much time do I have left?
[34:42.17]Two and a half hours?
[34:43.55]I got it.
[34:44.81]Easy.
[34:49.51]Alright, let's get Frank.
[34:54.62]Just stay on the road.
[34:56.90]I will stay on... I'm not gonna get off the horse.
[34:59.08]Okay.
[35:02.58]Alright, let's go, Frank.
[35:09.30]Staying on the road.
[35:11.07]No bullshit.
[35:11.77]This is his first time playing a video game.
[35:15.24]No, I'll give you a little bit of insight though.
[35:17.86]So this is video game... Let's just say video game one.
[35:22.38]Since playing video game one... Hold on a minute.
[35:27.36]That was scary.
[35:31.14]Because I can possibly get struck by lightning on this bridge.
[35:39.59]I'm not going to go that way, so...
[35:44.57]Just stay on the bridge.
[35:46.03]Oh, shrine.
[35:53.26]Yeah, just stay on the road, they say.
[35:56.80]Just stay on the road, they say.
[36:00.44]Look at all this shit.
[36:01.30]On the road.
[36:05.81]Where's this gonna take me?
[36:06.59]Alright, I'm getting close.
[36:13.45]Behind you.
[36:19.16]I told you I was just gonna climb the mountain after leaving the stable.
[36:22.21]And that's exactly what just happened.
[36:32.61]Look up.
[36:54.17]You missed it.
[36:57.01]What was there to miss?
[37:00.48]You missed it?
[37:03.44]He's leaving the road.
[37:04.40]Yeah, look at this.
[37:04.94]There's these things here.
[37:05.46]They're gonna kill me.
[37:08.02]You missed the dragon.
[37:09.02]I don't know about any dragons.
[37:12.62]I'm trying to get to the... I'm trying to get to the divine beast.
[37:26.18]Alright, so what I was saying is... So, okay.
[37:29.38]So, I played this game back in April of 2023, I think.
[37:36.03]It's been about five full months since I've not seen any of the Zelda on screen.
[37:40.19]In the meantime, I've played like 40 other video games.
[37:45.25]So, it's like each video game kind of is... Like, wait a minute.
[37:49.10]Is this... What?
[37:50.26]Oh, no.
[37:50.54]That's from Armored Core.
[37:51.70]That's a game I played a week ago.
[37:53.42]Not four months ago.
[37:55.87]Oh, wait a minute.
[37:56.73]Okay, this is what I can do.
[37:57.99]I can do that.
[37:58.59]No, no, no, wait.
[37:59.29]Shit, that's from Hitman 3.
[38:01.17]Oh, I did it.
[38:03.07]Wait, what?
[38:07.07]Um... I... I need to shoot these.
[38:11.18]Do I have any arrows?
[38:15.88]What arrows do I have?
[38:16.58]Hold on.
[38:18.22]Do I have regular arrows?
[38:19.06]Oh, my God.
[38:24.90]Okay, well, I can do that.
[38:26.18]Just come here.
[38:29.00]I really don't want to use ice arrows.
[38:32.50]Come on, dude.
[38:46.77]Oh, dragon!
[38:51.35]I'm so impatient.
[38:52.17]I hate it.
[39:04.19]Alright, we got a seed.
[39:07.10]I can probably upgrade this, right?
[39:17.60]Five?
[39:17.90]Alright, well, that's the destination.
[39:20.68]I'm going that way.
[39:21.26]Forget about these guys.
[39:23.98]Okay.
[39:34.51]You won't beat this Divine Beast in three hours?
[39:36.17]I betcha I do.
[39:40.93]I wanna unlock this.
[39:47.39]You need to buy- Yeah, I'm definitely gonna get arrows, for sure.
[39:59.30]Oh yeah, that's really funny.
[40:02.66]The Jeremy from eight months ago when I last played this would have got hit by that 100%.
[40:18.05]Okay.
[40:22.60]Let me put on a different weapon.
[40:28.74]Okay, hold on.
[40:29.16]Let me relearn the entire video game.
[40:31.30]Got it.
[40:38.84]Oops.
[40:45.48]Your name is Jeremy?
[40:46.63]Uh... Yeah.
[40:49.65]Don't these things have eyes that you have to kill?
[41:03.75]I wonder if it matters.
[41:05.03]Maybe I just climb it.
[41:10.68]Alright, whoever's editing this video, I want you to make it look like I hit that thing right in the head and then have it, like, cut it out and then do an animation so it looks like I fucking killed it in one hit.
[41:21.07]That's why I did that.
[41:33.64]Can I just get on top of this right now?
[41:37.09]Hold on.
[41:37.41]I can't touch that stuff.
[41:40.99]Where's the eye?
[41:41.51]There's like an eye on this.
[41:47.05]That comes across here.
[41:47.87]I feel like this is going to hurt.
[41:50.61]Is there a better place for me to... Let me kill the eye.
[41:53.87]I know it exists somewhere over here.
[42:03.59]Because you can get rid of this purple stuff.
[42:09.16]Chat's lying to you?
[42:10.30]No, there's no eye.
[42:12.70]Oh, it's okay.
[42:15.18]Just climb?
[42:18.32]Is there a better place to grab it from?
[42:20.17]Hold on, let me go up here.
[42:25.99]The backseat dream streamer.
[42:35.27]Hold on.
[42:35.67]This is windy.
[42:46.51]Grab.
[42:48.23]Um.
[42:49.67]Is there a place I can?
[42:54.02]Shit.
[43:06.12]Is there no spot I can go up?
[43:07.22]I don't think there is up here.
[43:13.27]Alright, so I have to kill something then.
[43:17.37]No, jump.
[43:18.33]Why are you... No, I want to just jump backwards.
[43:22.45]I want to just jump backwards, but of course not.
[43:26.00]Oh my god.
[43:27.06]I wanted to just jump backwards, but I'm not facing the exact perfect angle to go back.
[43:38.72]I have to save the game too.
[43:39.90]Somebody just said.
[43:40.44]Okay.
[43:48.29]Alright.
[43:49.75]Where's the eye?
[43:50.29]Tell me.
[43:57.34]You should heal.
[43:57.92]Should I?
[44:01.06]I'll eat a banana.
[44:01.62]That sounds good.
[44:06.57]Oh, everyone's lying.
[44:07.25]There is no eye.
[44:07.83]Okay.
[44:08.11]Alright, so don't trust chat.
[44:09.47]There's no eye.
[44:11.93]How do I get up there then?
[44:20.74]Climb the stump.
[44:23.70]I need to buy food if I can or harvest some food.
[44:28.37]This just is... What just gives you hearts?
[44:33.13]Eh, whatever.
[44:37.15]Is there a place I can go from?
[44:49.88]I bet if I get up here I can do it.
[44:51.72]Need to find a safe spot.
[45:12.39]If there is an eye, it's going to be in some weird random place, isn't it?
[45:16.11]But maybe I just can't get up there unless I do something in particular.
[45:19.30]There's an eye behind you.
[45:23.60]It's not it right there, is it?
[45:29.00]Did I just see it right there?
[45:31.50]It's right there.
[45:31.94]It's right there.
[45:32.30]It's right there.
[45:32.64]It's right there.
[45:34.30]Look at how hidden this is.
[45:42.28]Did you see how hidden that was?
[45:43.82]Okay, we're good.
[45:52.57]Alright.
[45:53.87]Good to go.
[46:06.50]Oh, please don't fall.
[46:16.41]I wanted to jump backwards.
[46:17.97]How do you just jump?
[46:31.46]I pressed just B and he just fell down.
[46:33.34]He didn't jump backwards.
[46:35.04]By the way, I win.
[46:51.69]Okay, fall down here.
[46:56.19]Can I ask a backseat question?
[46:57.82]How do you just drop?
[47:00.14]Because when I press B, he jumps up.
[47:02.04]How do I just let go?
[47:03.24]It's X, right?
[47:06.11]Of course it is.
[47:08.31]How do I jump backwards?
[47:14.37]Is it down and B?
[47:15.69]It is.
[47:15.91]Okay.
[47:17.55]But you have to be doing it the right.
[47:18.73]So it's not down and B. It's like if I was facing like over there, it'd be left and B. Okay.
[47:30.16]Can I make it?
[47:32.24]No.
[47:37.06]Alright.
[47:42.43]I got it.
[47:57.73]That took 25 minutes?
[48:05.73]He's not gonna beat Ganon.
[48:07.39]Watch me!
[48:13.73]I can't wait till the credits roll and all the people that bet against me are just seething.
[48:29.12]Okay.
[48:34.07]There we go.
[48:36.87]So we're going.
[48:37.51]Oh, look at that.
[48:40.89]Now I know exactly where the hell I can go.
[48:43.37]This thing's on an island.
[48:44.43]I didn't know that.
[48:47.28]Alright.
[48:48.50]Here we go.
[48:49.84]What else is over here?
[48:55.00]I think we're just gliding over there.
[48:59.15]I'm gliding to that shrine over there.
[49:00.83]Look at that, perfect.
[49:31.95]If you get to the last hour, please just go right to Ganon.
[49:35.49]Even if I'm in the middle of doing this.
[49:42.05]Go immediately to Ganon when they're alright.
[49:45.34]So what at 335?
[49:48.14]I have to go right to Ganon no matter what.
[49:51.94]That's actually really funny.
[49:54.98]Alright, well, here we are.
[49:59.43]There's a shrine here.
[50:00.65]And the thing I need to do is right here.
[50:02.57]It's right here.
[50:05.67]What's the best way to get in here?
[50:06.73]This way?
[50:07.15]Around here?
[50:07.71]Maybe this... Okay, top left maybe?
[50:11.53]Alright, there's a bridge over here.
[50:29.48]That's weird.
[50:31.86]Wait, does this do anything?
[50:33.96]It's not like a thing I can activate, right?
[50:40.43]Get away from me.
[50:40.91]Alright, there's the bridge up into there, and then I start that Divine Beast.
[50:49.15]I'll have a solid probably hour and 25 minutes, hour and 30 minutes to beat it.
[50:54.52]I do need to buy stuff.
[50:55.24]I need to buy arrows, and I need to buy... I need to get some heals.
[51:10.81]Alright, I think I made decent time going that way.
[51:17.72]Why are you getting blindfolded?
[51:19.87]We're not doing that today.
[51:35.71]Have you done Hyrule Castle at all?
[51:38.21]I don't think so.
[51:39.02]Hey, stables.
[51:41.06]Alright, I am going... I actually am going to take a minute to kind of... I need to get the horse.
[51:51.32]I'll do that.
[51:52.24]We'll actually kick the horse this time and not just throw away.
[52:03.22]I do want to get at least somewhat prepared.
[52:17.65]So, can I buy stuff from you?
[52:20.02]Just like a general store, right?
[52:22.04]I wonder.
[52:22.52]Can I?
[52:22.78]No, you have to pay for this.
[52:28.34]No, no, no, no.
[52:29.44]Is there a store here?
[52:31.38]This is just the stables and inn.
[52:34.95]Oh, beetle.
[52:35.55]Where's beetle?
[52:38.87]Is beetle random?
[52:39.61]I think beetle... Oh, no, no, no.
[52:41.07]You're right here.
[52:41.51]Okay.
[52:47.67]Alright, what do you got?
[52:52.15]Uh, alright.
[52:54.03]Incredibly important.
[52:55.43]I need a ton of these, right?
[52:58.11]I should get as many arrows as I can physically carry.
[53:06.88]Buy every arrow.
[53:07.98]Alright, I'm gonna buy every single arrow.
[53:14.86]These are expensive!
[53:24.91]Okay, what about this stuff?
[53:28.31]Okay, cold resist.
[53:29.49]I'm going to get all these.
[53:31.95]Cook it with monster parts for an elixir.
[53:34.78]Give me them all.
[53:38.10]Okay.
[53:42.00]Temporarily max stamina.
[53:48.28]Quiet movement.
[53:50.20]I don't think I need that.
[53:53.24]Now let me go make some cold resist stuff.
[53:59.37]Over here.
[53:59.81]Alright, the monster parts.
[54:06.03]Alright, ingredient.
[54:12.55]Any of these wings higher quality?
[54:14.49]Or just different properties?
[54:20.72]Explode electricity.
[54:23.26]I have a few of these frogs already.
[54:28.14]Okay, so I want to make an elixir.
[54:32.20]That's monster parts.
[54:33.28]The thing I just got.
[54:34.14]How about some carrots?
[54:35.54]Okay, where are those?
[54:43.69]What are they?
[54:44.21]Butterflies or something?
[54:44.97]Or moths?
[54:45.79]What are they?
[54:46.13]Where are they?
[54:52.62]There's a thing I just bought.
[54:54.36]Oh, here, let's get down here.
[54:58.38]Alright, so how many of these should I hold?
[54:59.76]Just one?
[55:01.50]Or should I put five of these in here?
[55:06.11]Should I just make one with a bunch of random stuff or do four with all five?
[55:09.79]Do them all.
[55:11.77]Four with a monster part.
[55:13.13]Four with guts.
[55:13.65]Hell yeah, let's go.
[55:17.55]Any type of guts I should use?
[55:23.02]I mean, this thing's pretty good.
[55:28.33]Would everybody be alright with this?
[55:33.91]It needs to be guts, not tail.
[55:37.90]Okay.
[55:40.02]How about this?
[55:45.36]This looks pretty good.
[55:53.37]I think this would just be crazy.
[55:57.47]Alright, that's high level cold resist.
[56:03.47]No.
[56:04.21]The other thing.
[56:06.49]What do you mean we got him?
[56:07.83]Oh my fucking god.
[56:08.93]Wait, was that bad?
[56:10.75]Now just go, go, go, go, go!
[56:12.31]Alright, alright, alright, alright!
[56:13.96]Okay now, go!
[56:17.02]Alright, I'm going, I'm going!
[56:25.06]Alright, that's gonna make it to the bridge.
[56:27.21]I can't turn I can't turn I can't turn How do you control the horse in this game?
[56:33.13]I can't turn What go on the bridge
[57:00.93]Oh my God, why?
[57:09.87]That was so outrageous.
[57:17.57]It's a horse on a bridge.
[57:18.79]Leave him alone.
[57:19.43]I guess that is a kind of scary.
[57:24.87]He's outraged right now.
[57:26.81]Alright, here we go.
[57:29.16]It's time to start the mission.
[57:34.07]Alright, you know what?
[57:34.65]I'm getting off.
[57:35.75]I'm getting off.
[57:36.35]The horse... Not only does the horse not like bridges, the horse just wants to go in a straight line.
[57:42.42]Off the cliff.
[57:43.84]I'm not about that right now.
[57:58.77]He is not about that.
[58:02.75]Cool.
[58:04.03]Alright.
[58:12.81]So what's the strategy here?
[58:13.75]How do we get up there?
[58:14.29]I don't understand what's going on, dude.
[58:19.24]Didn't you kill that guy in one shot?
[58:22.08]Oh, earlier, yeah.
[58:23.36]I got through phase one really quickly.
[58:24.54]It's a speedrun strat.
[58:26.56]Phase two is when the actual ceiling fans start turning on.
[58:31.40]Which allows them to go a little bit higher.
[58:32.86]So, that's phase two.
[58:35.32]Really keen eye you have there, though.
[58:36.98]Really keen eye.
[58:41.04]Okay, here we are.
[58:42.04]Rito Village.
[58:45.41]Now's not time to talk, but there is.
[58:48.61]Now's not a good time.
[58:50.03]Where am I?
[58:51.19]This is Rito Village, but, well, you could say we're not in a welcoming mood.
[58:54.39]Okay.
[58:55.69]Okay.
[59:00.77]So we have to go, I'm imagining probably up here at the top.
[59:05.88]Blow the dust out of your switch, bro.
[59:18.02]I think that's just how this game runs.
[59:22.98]Alright, this is really important.
[59:24.78]Is there anything that I need from here?
[59:29.29]More arrows, I'll take them.
[59:35.59]Three arrows for 60 bucks?
[59:40.52]Oh, it's a bundle, okay.
[59:48.71]Oh, it's expensive.
[59:51.83]I'm imagining there's probably gear I should get, too.
[59:53.65]I want to check that out first.
[60:03.39]Alright.
[60:05.43]Snow quill trousers.
[60:08.19]Cold resist.
[60:09.67]Five.
[60:11.11]Three.
[60:12.47]Cold resist.
[60:13.01]Okay, so which one has the most cold resist?
[60:14.92]Does it matter?
[60:15.38]Are they all the same?
[60:18.38]He's broke.
[60:18.98]I have enough of the chest piece.
[60:20.00]What do I got on right now?
[60:22.62]I have the... Okay, this is the swimming ones.
[60:27.32]I want to keep the bandana on.
[60:34.87]Okay, this one's good.
[60:36.43]Uh, I'm gonna buy it.
[60:45.91]Actually, I need to upgrade this.
[60:46.91]This thing is terrible.
[60:49.37]Oh, no, it's not.
[60:50.32]13.
[60:50.34]That's good.
[60:51.36]Yeah, put it on.
[60:51.84]That's fine.
[60:54.82]Do some selling.
[60:55.40]I could sell some stuff.
[61:00.26]What should I sell?
[61:07.28]Dude, I'm selling this.
[61:08.87]Oh, it's only 15.
[61:09.83]Never mind.
[61:14.35]Selling my exclusive Nintendo Switch shirt for 15 coins.
[61:19.65]I have a lot of Tofas.
[61:21.39]I'm just going to sell like 10 of these.
[61:28.12]Five?
[61:29.28]Sell all the gems.
[61:30.40]Sell all of them.
[61:31.40]Look at all these gems you got.
[61:32.66]I'm going to keep one of each.
[61:36.99]Sixteen hundred bucks.
[61:44.57]Holy shit.
[61:47.43]I'm rich right now.
[61:48.73]You're never going to use these for any reason?
[61:51.97]Okay, true.
[61:53.91]You guys have to absolutely gas me up for this.
[61:57.19]I need every move.
[61:58.01]I need all the incredibly expensive shit.
[62:01.25]I want all the best gear in the whole game.
[62:03.09]I got five grand now.
[62:03.95]Where do I get it?
[62:08.69]Okay.
[62:17.24]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[62:19.84]I'm good.
[62:20.64]I'm not selling everything, no.
[62:21.84]There's no reason to.
[62:23.96]Okay, I'm getting these and I'm gonna get pants.
[62:33.00]I could go to that area.
[62:38.01]Alright, so... Is the power of fire to make cold climates more tolerable?
[62:44.88]Alright, so I am now completely resistant to cold.
[62:52.90]Is there anything else I should buy that I should really get?
[63:03.99]Get the bomb arrows?
[63:05.49]I was gonna say that too.
[63:06.35]I was thinking it, I just didn't say it out loud.
[63:14.06]You're a potato streamer?
[63:16.37]That's alright, I don't care.
[63:19.77]Potatoes are fucking incredibly easy to, like, make and eat and stuff.
[63:26.96]They're good.
[63:28.02]They're healthy.
[63:28.50]They're filling.
[63:29.48]Who cares?
[63:29.76]Why are you saying that's a bad thing?
[63:32.54]Is it butter too?
[63:33.78]Yeah, fine.
[63:42.14]I'll take one.
[63:57.97]Actually, I'm just getting this because it's food.
[64:15.07]You can't eat wheat?
[64:16.31]I can combine it with stuff.
[64:26.95]Somebody said, keep it moving.
[64:29.19]Keep it moving.
[64:30.33]Okay.
[64:31.11]Oh, did you say I've never seen somebody spend $3,000 on food ever in this game?
[64:43.53]Yeah, but they weren't up against the clock.
[64:58.63]Oh, hold on a second.
[64:59.49]Look at this.
[65:01.27]I need to.
[65:03.97]Unlock the shrine.
[65:04.69]Is there anything over here that I can teleport to that's not the shrine?
[65:13.19]That's a good let me actually get the quest first.
[65:15.81]Here we go.
[65:16.31]Alright, let's go.
[65:16.85]Let's do it.
[65:19.79]Welcome old object on your hip could be.
[65:23.39]Give me where my man.
[65:24.95]I am currently elder of Rito Village.
[65:30.07]Now then, is that not a sheikish slate dangling from your hip?
[65:36.43]Oh my, so it is true.
[65:39.63]It means you must be a champion like Master Revali, one of the few able to board Divine Beast of Medoh.
[65:49.32]What am I thinking?
[65:50.02]The champions have all been dead for a hundred years.
[65:54.35]I must have- there must be a mere descendant, an inheritor of the Sheikah's plate.
[65:59.00]Ah forgive me. Champion descendant, if you would listen to this old man's request would you have given my eternal gratitude.
[66:03.00]Sure. Listen.
[66:04.00]Thank you, now that I know that you have the blood of a champion there's something I must ask you.
[66:09.00]How should I put this? I would like for you to deal with the giant beast cycling above us.
[66:13.00]Only a certain amount of champion can stop a giant beast you must enter the beast and be honest with you.
[66:17.00]I explained this to you more headstrong greater warriors but they wouldn't listen to reason.
[66:22.00]Teba and Harth tried to confront Medoh, but it did not go well, and Harth was injured.
[66:28.00]Teba escaped unscathed, but I fear he now plans to face Medoh alone.
[66:33.00]As a decendant-
[66:35.00]You get it.
[66:36.69]Alright, find Teba. If you work together you may be able to stop Divine Beast Vah Medoh.
[66:44.91]Okay!
[66:54.00]Forgive my intrustion, but I overheard you speaking with the elder.
[66:57.00]It sounds like you intend to help my husband, Teba, in the fight against Medoh.
[67:03.00]But to tell you the truth, there is not much I can do for you right now beyond telling you where my husband went.
[67:08.00]Alright, where'd he go?
[67:11.54]Well, my husband headed to a place called the Flight Range.
[67:15.50]It's in Draunok's Pass at the base of the Hebra Mountains.
[67:20.42]It's a place where Rito warriors prepare for aerial combat.
[67:22.66]He's gone there to gather weapons for another run at Medoh.
[67:26.83]As it happens, he made his way to the Flight Range on foot this time.
[67:34.79]You take off from Revali's Landing.
[67:37.41]It's a straight shot down to the Flight Range.
[67:40.95]Rivali's Landing is a memorial for the Rito champion, Rivali.
[67:46.35]Okay.
[67:47.49]Alright, I'm ready.
[67:52.43]How much pizza do I eat a year?
[67:53.71]Um, let's do the math.
[67:57.69]We got... Let's say like one to two pizzas a month.
[68:02.13]Maybe like one pizza a month, maybe?
[68:06.52]Twelve, maybe twelve to fifteen pizzas a year.
[68:13.35]depends those are rookie numbers sometimes it's more depends
[68:31.39]impressive I know very few can achieve a mastery of the sky okay cool yet I have made an art of creating an updraft that allows me to solve this is where I'm going to learn how to consider to be quite the masterpiece of aerial techniques even among the rito with proper utilization of my superior skills I see no reason why we couldn't easily didn't I get really mad at flying last time my ability to explore the firmament is certainly of note
[68:58.15]But let's not, pardon me for being so blunt, let's not forget the fact that I am the most skilled archer of all the Rito.
[69:05.64]Yet despite these truths, it seems that I've been tapped to merely assist you.
[69:10.70]All because you happen to have that little darkness-sealing sword on your back.
[69:14.92]The Master Sword, right?
[69:16.02]I mean... I'm glad I picked that up.
[69:17.56]It's just asinine.
[69:20.92]Unless you think you can prove me wrong, maybe we should just settle this one-on-one.
[69:27.79]Is this a you don't have wings and I do hahaha moment?
[70:00.46]Okay.
[70:05.57]Wait, what just happened?
[70:07.09]Are you alright?
[70:08.77]My apologies.
[70:09.49]I fear I have said far too much.
[70:10.87]Is there anything you do not understand?
[70:12.45]Please do not hesitate.
[70:15.54]Alright.
[70:17.76]Let's go.
[70:20.50]How far away is that?
[70:22.60]That's nothing.
[70:23.32]I can literally... I can glide there.
[70:26.49]Very easily.
[70:29.75]Let me get the shrine, though.
[70:33.83]I don't want to have to run back here.
[70:38.02]Where is it?
[70:42.42]It's beeping.
[70:43.02]Where is it, though?
[70:48.02]Backseaters, I need your help.
[70:52.10]Oh, there it is.
[70:55.78]Stop wasting time.
[70:56.60]I am not wasting time.
[70:58.08]I've got plenty of time.
[71:00.63]I've got two full hours.
[71:03.95]There might even be time to have a snack.
[71:13.28]Okay, cool.
[71:20.61]Then we gotta go that way.
[71:22.81]You know what I'm doing.
[71:26.01]I need to cook this food though.
[71:29.28]I need a fire to cook the food.
[71:30.78]Even though I do have some, I do have some meals.
[71:34.26]Wait, are you going to tell me that I can do this?
[71:36.58]I don't want to hear a story.
[71:37.40]I'm sorry.
[71:37.80]I don't think I can make that.
[71:42.75]Maybe I'm up top.
[71:47.71]What?
[71:49.85]I don't... Now all of a sudden you guys don't care about the time constraint?
[71:55.29]five seconds ago it was hurry up hurry up dummy and now all of a sudden it's I want to hear the story can I make this I think I can get up here I promise this will shave time somehow
[72:24.22]I promise this will shave a little bit of time.
[72:32.39]So we get a place where I can stand, which I think I can stand up here.
[72:41.80]Looks like I can, right?
[72:45.38]Sometimes it lets you just... It's not.
[72:49.41]Come on.
[72:49.77]Right there.
[72:50.05]There's a lip right here.
[73:17.53]Okay, now from here I'm going to glide across the entire thing.
[73:34.86]I can walk on this for sure.
[73:36.08]I can't?
[73:38.61]No way.
[73:40.03]I can definitely walk right there.
[73:44.15]No way, I can definitely land on that.
[73:48.97]Good.
[73:52.44]And now... I don't need to go all the way up.
[73:56.58]I just wanted to do this.
[74:19.93]That definitely shaved off some time.
[74:21.17]It had to have, right?
[74:21.77]You would have made it without climbing?
[74:35.64]I don't think I would have.
[74:36.28]If I just jumped off that dock.
[74:41.02]Look at that, and here we are.
[74:46.29]Okay, so here's the thing.
[74:47.29]If I do beat... Okay, if I get to Ganon with an hour remaining, maybe I have enough time to do those shrines.
[74:54.14]It's okay.
[75:02.04]Okay, we got that.
[75:03.10]Here we go.
[75:04.36]I do want to heal.
[75:05.22]That's definitely smart.
[75:07.35]What food can I eat that's not going to... This is just cold resist.
[75:10.93]Should I just eat this right now?
[75:13.51]Low level cold resist.
[75:14.41]I get the hearts back.
[75:17.51]Why not?
[75:18.51]I'm just gonna eat it.
[75:23.23]Oh.
[75:25.51]I got the Master Sword.
[75:26.37]I got targets to shoot at.
[75:41.94]Hyrule Castle is gonna take him two days.
[75:46.89]No, it's not.
[75:50.03]And a free bow.
[75:50.67]Alright, so what bow do I have right now that I just need to get rid of?
[75:58.16]Which is the worst bow that I have?
[76:00.96]This thing's almost dead, so why not just use it?
[76:11.71]Cook the wheat.
[76:12.27]Yeah, I'll cook all the food here.
[76:13.29]Yeah.
[76:18.60]Need to find this person.
[76:21.13]I don't know you and I'm actually pretty busy here.
[76:24.79]You should probably go.
[76:25.97]OK.
[76:33.33]I'm going to cook.
[76:40.55]Let's put some some it doesn't matter.
[76:49.58]There's so many materials.
[76:50.60]Didn't I just buy a bunch of wheat?
[76:52.54]Where is it?
[76:52.88]There's a little bit of butter.
[77:09.51]One of these.
[77:11.75]Another one of these.
[77:12.69]Sure.
[77:13.11]Why not?
[77:16.39]Okay.
[77:29.59]And I'll do that one more time.
[77:31.09]I have another... I have a couple, right?
[77:40.31]Ooh.
[77:41.31]Yeah.
[77:42.68]I just want the heart.
[77:51.90]Put a hoof in there.
[77:54.23]Alright.
[77:55.03]I... I don't care about cooking.
[77:57.31]I have health.
[77:57.79]I have health.
[77:58.23]I'll beat it.
[77:58.65]I don't need it.
[78:02.15]Alright, so what's the deal here?
[78:03.11]My name's Link.
[78:20.51]Oh, by the way, stay tuned because I'm going to be beating punch out every regular circuit without falling down more than once.
[78:27.18]So if you want to see that, I would stay tuned.
[78:33.96]That's when the the lower right corner of me with my arms crossed kind of superimposed green screen in the bottom right.
[78:42.25]It's like and at 8 o'clock central.
[78:46.41]The punch out challenge.
[78:48.82]And then it goes away after like 10 seconds.
[78:57.36]You should take your time.
[79:03.37]Okay.
[79:04.73]Once Divine Beast Van Mado falls from the sky, if I have to kill Mado, so be it.
[79:12.09]Only then.
[79:12.55]Alright, let's go.
[79:13.17]We can do it.
[79:14.09]Okay.
[79:19.78]As the Elder said, the only way to stop Divine Beast Van Mado is to get inside of it.
[79:25.16]Bad chance of that happening.
[79:26.14]There's no way we can set foot in Mado.
[79:28.94]Actually... Wait, did I actually this guy?
[79:33.30]So not only are you wingless, you're brainless too.
[79:35.70]Okay.
[79:41.20]Oh, I am one of the five champions.
[79:43.40]Let me tell you.
[79:46.03]I need to test you before I can take you with me.
[79:48.49]We retail warriors use the updraft in this ravine to hone our aerial archery skills.
[79:51.83]The updrafts are so strong here that a person could... I'm going to fail this a lot, so you just leave.
[80:19.89]Some of you were debating.
[80:21.87]Some of you were debating on like, oh man, maybe he'll get this done in like 30 minutes.
[80:26.76]Now is the time for you just to go do laundry or make lunch or something or dinner.
[80:32.42]When you come back, I'll still be here.
[80:33.48]Don't worry.
[80:33.76]Alright.
[80:35.84]The updrafts are so strong here that you can.
[80:37.88]Yeah.
[80:38.20]Yep.
[80:39.38]Let's go.
[80:40.80]Destroy all five targets in three hours.
[80:44.30]You got it.
[80:44.62]Hmm.
[81:01.91]I just shot three... Hold on a minute.
[81:03.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:04.79]I don't want to shoot three arrows at the same fucking time.
[81:07.76]I want to shoot one arrow.
[81:10.44]How do I go back?
[81:15.12]It only uses one?
[81:15.88]Oh.
[81:19.18]Okay.
[81:26.59]Fucking thing broke in my hands.
[81:32.84]Uh, what's the second worst bow?
[81:39.60]This one.
[81:41.64]Okay.
[81:50.34]Okay, we're good.
[81:54.44]I really hope that wasn't shooting more than one arrow.
[81:58.18]Uh-huh, you must have seen a battle or two.
[82:09.56]I've seen a few.
[82:10.16]Let's not brag here.
[82:12.80]I can tell just by looking at you.
[82:13.81]Don't be modest.
[82:14.49]I feel I've heard the name somewhere.
[82:16.69]Link.
[82:16.85]Link.
[82:18.18]Well, if you really want to help me bring down Madoa, it's now or never.
[82:21.81]Let's get you into position so you can give its cannons all you got.
[82:24.23]Alright.
[82:25.81]Inside that treasure chest is a bow I've modified.
[82:28.83]Take it and let me know when you're ready.
[82:35.51]Falcon bow.
[82:37.03]Highly refined Rito-made bow created by a master Rito craftsman.
[82:41.70]Rito warriors favored for its superior rate of fire.
[82:44.36]Ooh.
[82:44.68]This thing looks pretty good.
[82:51.22]This thing's awesome.
[82:52.00]Look at this thing.
[82:56.94]Okay, is it on fire now?
[82:57.84]Weren't there arrows in here I could take?
[82:59.50]Or did I take them already?
[83:02.00]Free bow?
[83:02.34]Alright, I'm ready.
[83:06.82]Let's go.
[83:10.22]You guys ready?
[83:10.76]I need bomb arrows.
[83:14.77]Alright.
[83:18.48]You just gave me 20 of these.
[83:19.64]These things that person you just gave me.
[83:22.72]Like five grand.
[83:26.92]I'm good.
[83:27.50]I already got food in me.
[83:28.52]I've already got good clothes on.
[83:32.56]Why are you doing this?
[83:33.32]Why risk your life to bring down the dough?
[83:36.28]It's for a bet.
[83:41.60]The rescue Zelda.
[83:43.14]The name of the Princess for Valley served 100 years ago.
[83:46.26]I rule castle.
[83:52.00]As long as you're helping me bring down Bado, your motivation is fine by me.
[83:54.88]Let's go.
[83:57.51]Alright, so let's do it.
[83:58.97]Let me save the game first.
[84:03.07]This is all about just landing shots.
[84:05.05]I'm going to try really hard.
[84:05.89]I'm not going to fuck around.
[84:15.03]Okay, just hit the targets.
[84:16.54]It's showtime.
[84:19.53]Okay, so what do I need to hit the cannons?
[84:25.41]There's Divine Beast Ven Medoh.
[84:28.79]And it has its barrier up again.
[84:30.39]What a pain.
[84:32.03]What's wrong?
[84:32.77]Too scared?
[84:34.71]Okay.
[84:36.65]See those cannons?
[84:38.06]I'll draw their fire.
[84:39.46]While I'm doing that, use your bomb arrows to destroy the cannons.
[84:42.54]Got it.
[84:43.12]I got it.
[84:44.69]If you need to withdraw for a bit, just spread your cloth and float straight up into the updraft for a while.
[84:50.63]I'll take that as a sign that we need to regroup.
[84:52.33]Don't bother aiming for anything covered by the barrier.
[84:56.23]Whatever you do, don't get close enough to touch it.
[84:59.37]Well, that would be on you.
[85:00.21]Because I'm not the one... You're... I'm on... I'm on top of you.
[85:04.83]Alright, finally, I know I said this a few times.
[85:07.55]I have cold on.
[85:11.25]Let's go.
[85:14.85]Now blow up those cannons.
[85:16.61]What the fuck just happened?
[85:22.69]Can you come back?
[85:25.28]Dude, get over here!
[85:27.40]Why did I come?
[85:27.98]Why did I fall off?
[85:33.30]Let's go!
[85:34.06]Why did I jump off?
[85:36.71]What is happening?
[85:37.77]I thought I was supposed to be riding on him?
[85:45.41]How do I change the arrow that I have?
[85:58.07]Am I missing?
[85:58.57]Is it alive?
[86:09.78]Okay, we're good.
[86:11.60]I thought I was staying on his back.
[86:15.96]Can't hit this shit in the air, can you?
[86:31.20]Nope.
[86:37.61]Oh, sorry, did you miss?
[86:39.75]Piece of shit.
[86:45.13]One at the top, maybe?
[86:47.17]I think I can probably hit this from here.
[86:57.64]If I aim it right.
[87:06.61]I'll do the same thing I just did in the other one.
[87:12.59]I think I can hit it from here.
[87:20.48]Shit.
[87:20.72]I got it.
[87:23.42]Is that all of them, or is there one more?
[87:36.11]One more in the front, I bet.
[87:37.57]Yep.
[87:58.19]Let's go.
[88:02.43]Now he's going to get inside, right?
[88:03.55]That's a two hour puzzle session.
[88:18.38]Oh, coming up you mean.
[88:33.13]It'll be 45 minutes to beat this.
[88:35.73]Whatever.
[88:38.79]This one doesn't look that big.
[88:42.89]This does not look as large as the other ones were inside.
[88:54.80]He doesn't know.
[88:55.36]Is this actually a Pepe laugh?
[88:56.77]That's not good.
[88:57.41]Pepe laugh.
[89:32.65]Okay.
[89:38.30]Jeremy, can you wish me a good day at school today?
[89:40.38]A good day at school?
[89:51.09]What school?
[89:57.22]Sunday?
[89:58.20]It's a weekend.
[89:59.88]You mean for tomorrow?
[90:00.82]It's probably Bible school?
[90:02.24]Sunday school.
[90:05.93]Have a good day at Sunday school.
[90:07.33]I'm against the clock right now.
[90:09.19]Hold on.
[90:26.97]If so, then the first thing you want to do is find yourself a man.
[90:30.27]He thinks America is the only country.
[90:33.69]It's... EU is not in school right now.
[90:38.58]Maybe Asia?
[90:40.10]Australia?
[90:42.44]Australia from here is plus 14.
[90:43.58]I don't think it's school time for Australia.
[90:45.34]Is it?
[90:45.54]Wait, it is.
[90:45.98]It's like 6 a.m.
[90:46.32]right now in Australia.
[90:57.79]Hey, OK.
[90:58.39]Hey.
[90:59.65]Have a good day at school.
[91:06.56]OK, I'm I gotta I gotta play.
[91:17.04]So.
[91:18.58]Do we have to do anything weird with this one?
[91:24.40]Divine Be... There's no weird shit to do.
[91:27.32]It's not like, oh, I have to move the elephant or whatever.
[91:30.24]I have to move the trunk up and down.
[91:31.48]It's not anything like that, right?
[91:35.88]Hold on, I want that, whatever that is.
[91:36.82]I have to just touch all those things.
[91:47.76]Wait a minute.
[91:49.82]I can... Yep.
[91:51.04]Okay, so what if I go all the way up?
[91:57.28]What's up here?
[91:58.06]I can keep going up.
[92:00.18]Can I open the map of the... I don't think I can.
[92:08.51]Alright, I need to find those kiosks.
[92:21.95]Is there none up in this top?
[92:23.56]Oh, wait.
[92:26.38]At what point do I go too high up and I lose gravity of the Divine Beast or whatever it is?
[92:31.32]Does it matter?
[92:36.12]OK, well.
[92:53.62]I'm just going to go down here.
[92:56.76]to get the map first.
[92:57.96]I'm sorry.
[92:58.46]I was wishing somebody good luck in Sunday school.
[93:01.50]I was a little distracted.
[93:02.44]Sorry.
[93:02.74]I gotta go to the map room.
[93:15.31]Okay.
[93:16.89]How do you swing?
[93:18.19]I'm gonna swing... Okay.
[93:49.20]Here we go.
[93:50.33]What is this boring ass game?
[93:54.42]Alright, come on, dude.
[93:55.94]You can think that Zelda's boring, but you know what the game is.
[94:00.65]Do you know what I mean?
[94:01.21]Like, you have to know what the game is.
[94:04.09]You know this is Zelda.
[94:05.07]I mean, you might think the game sucks.
[94:07.21]That's alright.
[94:07.85]Everybody has their own games they like.
[94:10.19]But it's Zelda.
[94:11.07]You know what it is.
[94:15.09]The terminals that will activate Meadow are marked by those glowing points.
[94:19.95]You agree with him?
[94:21.95]No, I... No, I'm just... Thanks for defending us.
[94:27.97]I was... Wait, people think... Was I agreeing?
[94:35.54]He's agreeing with him.
[94:40.22]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[94:41.38]No, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[94:42.94]I have to move some things around.
[94:45.45]Oops.
[94:47.23]Oops.
[94:49.11]Oh fuck, this is gonna take all day.
[94:52.13]How was I ever gonna beat this in three hours?
[94:53.59]Don't say that yet.
[95:05.19]Okay, um...
[95:15.96]So it's either, okay, it's either up, middle, tilt.
[95:21.50]You tilt it.
[95:22.42]I get it.
[95:22.84]So you can either tilt left or tilt right.
[95:24.74]Let me just take a quick look.
[95:31.09]Oh, fuck.
[95:32.77]Oh no, we're good.
[95:33.81]I don't want to shoot bomb arrows though.
[95:44.94]Chest.
[95:48.87]Just go to Ganon, dude.
[95:49.47]There's no way you're going to beat this puzzle.
[95:51.57]I think... No, I'm alright.
[95:52.37]I'm alright.
[95:52.79]I just need to actually sit here and pay attention for real.
[96:00.92]Can I destroy that?
[96:03.86]I don't think I can.
[96:05.06]Alright, hold on.
[96:11.33]Can I shoot that?
[96:21.02]I'm gonna shoot this.
[96:23.90]Save the game.
[96:24.44]It's been a long time.
[96:31.45]Just go to Ganon?
[96:32.15]I mean, I'm here right now.
[96:35.93]This is a really bad idea.
[96:36.97]I don't even know why I did that.
[96:46.67]Is there anything I can fly up with?
[96:59.91]Hold on.
[97:00.81]Can I grab on or something?
[97:02.05]Oh god, not into the helicopter, please!
[97:11.68]Okay, we're good.
[97:16.42]So if it tilts this way, I can freeze them, I bet.
[97:18.38]There's a chest down there.
[97:24.66]I go this way.
[97:30.71]The bird is so small.
[97:31.72]Where is all the stuff?
[97:35.76]Up?
[97:35.92]I don't know.
[97:36.84]Like where?
[97:45.16]Tilt it this way.
[97:51.35]They're like... In the wings.
[97:56.67]Where in the wings?
[97:58.19]Down below?
[97:58.85]And then through?
[98:02.58]That's cool.
[98:02.98]That gets me over here.
[98:04.48]Why did you do that?
[98:05.60]Look at this.
[98:10.71]Wait, what?
[98:11.49]I can't walk up this?
[98:33.71]Oh, there we go.
[98:34.15]Okay.
[98:34.37]Alright.
[98:34.77]So now I'm in here and I'm going to tilt it this way.
[98:36.57]No.
[98:36.89]Yes.
[98:37.53]So there's one right up here.
[99:09.86]Okay, this one.
[99:10.36]Okay.
[99:10.46]I'm gonna make it flat.
[99:39.64]So the next one is in the left.
[99:42.18]Is it like a little bunker or something over here?
[99:43.88]I'm going to get attacked, aren't I?
[99:50.87]What are these things for?
[99:52.59]Okay.
[99:59.05]Okay.
[100:20.05]Stop the spawning.
[100:21.37]What does this do?
[100:23.25]OK, I can open up the windows.
[100:30.31]Get some fresh air.
[100:32.69]That is doing what?
[100:34.61]Is that going to stay open?
[101:01.20]Alright, hold on a second.
[101:03.68]So, if I go like this... And then... Which direction should I move it this way?
[101:19.23]There?
[101:20.47]Oh shit, things are moving.
[101:21.41]Alright, I just press this big button?
[101:27.11]And now, do I close it?
[101:29.71]If I close it, will the... No, hold on.
[101:32.00]That closed that gate.
[101:40.24]What is... Okay, if I close the window, that closes that.
[101:46.42]Now this is stuck here.
[101:50.02]Which then... I just... What's the goal here?
[101:53.56]I don't know.
[101:55.98]I'm about to float out the window to Hyrule Castle, by the way.
[101:59.81]I'm about to just go out the window.
[102:00.77]I'll just float out the window to Hyrule Castle.
[102:11.79]Because I need to get in here.
[102:13.24]So how do I?
[102:14.24]What button opens that?
[102:18.46]What do I have to press to open this door?
[102:29.20]Button's not pressed all the way.
[102:30.34]Um.
[102:44.32]Do I tilt the word?
[102:46.40]Because this presses the button in all the way.
[102:49.54]But what does that actually even do?
[102:52.35]It closes this.
[102:55.87]No, it is pressed.
[102:57.19]Is it?
[103:01.26]If it doesn't, it needs to go faster.
[103:02.64]Alright, I'm very confused.
[103:09.52]I'm opening this again.
[103:12.74]It would be blue if it was pressed.
[103:20.12]So do I have to make it go like super speed?
[103:23.38]Down the... Hold on, what if I turn...
[103:30.87]OK, so I have to get rid of that.
[103:31.93]Because that's blocking this.
[103:36.53]That's OK, there it goes.
[103:39.15]Now we make it go to the right and it's going to be going wicked fast.
[103:43.59]Hold on, open this.
[103:49.68]Ooh, nice.
[103:52.02]OK, now I have to freeze.
[103:53.72]Am I freezing the door?
[104:00.27]What am I actually freezing here?
[104:04.59]Freeze on the fan.
[104:06.74]This one here, right?
[104:08.94]And then tilt it, freeze this so it'll move all the way over.
[104:13.64]Freeze the metal block.
[104:15.18]Sounds like I can.
[104:17.42]Freeze the square.
[104:19.58]Metal block.
[104:21.83]OK, so then now I tilt it.
[104:25.27]All the way up.
[104:26.81]Freeze this.
[104:28.27]Right now.
[104:35.12]Oh!
[104:37.00]Oh shit, wait.
[104:44.38]Alright, I got it, I got it.
[104:46.82]It's weird, it's weird.
[104:47.74]It's a puzzle, it takes a minute.
[104:49.10]Go all the way.
[105:09.73]Okay, let's try it again.
[105:11.03]I'm gonna wait.
[105:14.96]Keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, keep waiting, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[105:25.96]Hold on, I don't get this at all.
[105:32.27]Wait.
[105:33.03]What am I not getting here?
[105:35.73]What?
[105:36.75]I don't even need to do that at all!
[105:46.42]what is actually happening what is what is making this grate go down does that thing have to go all the way to the other side I actually don't understand how this is the mechanics of how this works what is making the gate go up
[106:11.81]So turning it again this way.
[106:16.57]Why wouldn't I want to just keep it right here?
[106:24.68]How come it's doing that?
[106:28.14]I just like did it.
[106:37.37]Use the magnesis on the block so the fan can keep spinning.
[106:40.62]Oh, so I don't have to freeze it.
[106:43.34]I completely forgot this was an item in the game.
[106:49.88]I completely forgot the magnet existed.
[106:54.20]God damn it.
[106:56.97]I literally can just go like this.
[107:04.35]Alright, well let's try it again.
[107:06.13]And now if I hold this, keep it right here.
[107:10.11]Okay.
[107:12.45]Hey, look at that.
[107:14.97]How can you keep forgetting this is in the game?
[107:16.85]Because I do this really fun thing where I play Breath of the Wild every six months.
[107:21.65]And then I don't play it for six months.
[107:31.60]Alright, let's go.
[107:38.35]6 is generous.
[107:41.67]There are three terminals remaining.
[107:44.09]Keep going.
[107:45.73]Can I get them all in a row?
[107:51.41]No, alright, we just gotta get the other side.
[107:52.73]There's three on the other side.
[107:55.27]Turn it this way.
[108:02.61]What are we looking at here?
[108:03.28]I gotta get up there.
[108:04.06]Secure that guy real quick.
[108:16.01]Alright, let's go over there.
[108:23.74]Wait, I want that one.
[108:26.37]I can't.
[108:27.13]I have no patience at all.
[108:28.89]Like zero.
[108:30.57]It goes to zero.
[108:32.69]I was doing it fine.
[108:34.72]My brain was like, I want to beat this so fast.
[108:38.41]I don't want to wait for the bird to turn.
[108:39.81]That's what was going through my head.
[108:41.79]Because I have to wait for the bird to turn.
[108:43.88]It's going to take 10 full seconds.
[108:45.32]I don't want to wait.
[108:48.22]Okay, well now I have to get back up there.
[108:58.16]Okay.
[109:03.95]There was the best way to get up there.
[109:07.43]Freezing this in the middle.
[109:09.18]Yeah.
[109:10.30]Who?
[109:35.48]Okay, then I can head to the left.
[109:47.07]Okay, second part.
[109:49.29]We got you, hold on.
[109:53.53]Okay.
[110:02.54]Get rid of the spawner.
[110:03.40]Alright, this is going to make this blow.
[110:13.08]What's happening?
[110:14.94]I gotta get up there.
[110:24.03]Anything on the ceiling?
[110:25.47]No, I think I know what to do.
[110:28.93]Tilt it this way.
[110:30.33]Maybe I can just fall in there.
[110:33.46]I think I can just fall in it.
[110:34.39]Watch this very carefully.
[110:38.75]I imagine that will work.
[110:42.05]Would that work?
[110:44.27]Of course it does.
[111:00.55]I almost got it.
[111:03.51]We're good.
[111:04.75]I think we're on pretty good pace right now.
[111:06.25]I've got more than a full hour to begin.
[111:08.05]I'm gonna have all the divine powers.
[111:12.89]I need to get through this door.
[111:16.45]I'm almost there.
[111:22.30]Yup.
[111:29.27]Oh, it doesn't blow up by itself, right.
[111:41.58]How do I explain that?
[111:44.68]I can't explain it, just laugh at the dumb thing I did, okay?
[112:01.04]Nice.
[112:05.36]Alright, now we put a bomb in there.
[112:09.49]Turn that off.
[112:11.79]And we can pop that.
[112:13.59]That's just right.
[112:17.37]No.
[112:19.93]Really?
[112:20.83]I can't.
[112:22.44]Now what do I do?
[112:34.73]Oh, come on.
[112:35.52]I had it.
[112:36.42]I didn't... I had it.
[112:39.28]No, we want to go this way.
[112:42.50]Okay, now I got to make it go that way.
[112:58.51]I don't think I can.
[112:59.23]Can I make it go that way?
[113:02.66]Oh, wait, I can.
[113:06.16]Okay.
[113:08.13]Okay.
[113:11.59]Very cool.
[113:13.01]Now... Now we do this.
[113:18.92]And I do magnetism through the wall.
[113:25.54]No, I don't.
[113:32.15]I do...
[113:34.80]tilt which way should I tilt this way no pull it out I can get it here I'll move it this way can I reach now oh get it on the track over there
[114:06.00]OK.
[114:08.11]Get it right here.
[114:08.75]Then we tilt it.
[114:13.60]That slam into it.
[114:33.24]There's only two more.
[114:35.26]This is actually much better than I thought it was.
[114:36.86]We're good.
[114:37.12]One terminal and it's down.
[114:37.76]It is down.
[114:38.10]Down there.
[114:39.52]Right below me.
[115:02.18]Okay, so... What's the deal?
[115:04.96]I think I'm gonna open this and then go out the window.
[115:10.90]Does that sound good?
[115:12.56]Everybody?
[115:12.94]It's right underneath me.
[115:30.86]I'm gonna save it right now.
[115:32.92]I feel like that's correct, but it probably isn't.
[115:39.65]Is that not correct?
[115:42.18]Oh no, go this way.
[116:03.75]It was not correct.
[116:05.17]I didn't know if there was like a lip because remember there was a little lip over there.
[116:07.48]Alright, this is where I want to be.
[116:14.46]So not above, but down to the left over there.
[116:17.48]OK, so what the heck is going on over here?
[116:21.53]Let's float in there.
[116:22.25]Let's go.
[116:24.03]OK.
[116:27.15]I gotta eat something.
[116:34.98]I'm gonna keep the cold resistance going.
[116:36.52]Yeah.
[116:40.92]Okay, that'll get rid of that.
[116:47.26]Is this pre-recorded?
[116:48.05]No.
[117:04.76]Okay.
[117:06.30]So it's that way.
[117:07.30]Is there another one of those things on the track?
[117:13.46]Because I got to get in there.
[117:15.02]So wait a minute.
[117:15.51]Hold on.
[117:15.75]If I tilt this way, I can probably float in there.
[117:21.15]Ooh, I got it.
[117:22.47]It's done.
[117:22.83]I just beat it.
[117:24.39]And we still have an hour and 20 minutes.
[117:27.33]I am doing just fine, by the way.
[117:28.98]Hold on.
[117:34.79]I'm not fighting.
[117:35.95]I don't think I can make it.
[117:48.44]Maybe I can.
[117:49.72]Yeah, I can.
[117:56.64]I'm good.
[117:57.76]That's them all.
[117:58.16]I got them all.
[118:03.78]Let's turn it on.
[118:04.74]So what's the superpower you get from the bird?
[118:07.32]Right in the middle.
[118:07.90]This one wasn't that bad.
[118:08.55]This one was fun.
[118:30.61]This was a lot shorter than the other ones.
[118:32.49]It seems like.
[118:33.93]I like it though, it's fun.
[118:43.12]Can I make this?
[118:53.34]OK.
[118:55.24]All the way up.
[119:02.25]Longer than the lizard, at least.
[119:05.31]Did I hate the lizard?
[119:10.51]I should probably get full health.
[119:11.57]This is a boss.
[119:18.12]Or close to full health.
[119:21.20]Alright, get the master sword out.
[119:28.02]It's not out already.
[119:29.18]Oops.
[119:33.22]Master Sword is here.
[119:34.22]60 damage.
[119:35.92]Holy shit.
[119:38.30]And what do I have for a bow?
[119:39.32]Falcon bow.
[119:41.46]That's fine.
[119:42.66]What do I have for arrows?
[119:46.64]I have a lot of bomb arrows.
[119:47.74]Maybe I'll use them.
[119:50.93]Okay.
[119:51.33]Well, that was annoying.
[119:54.11]Alright.
[119:54.49]Are we ready?
[119:54.89]Let's go.
[119:58.33]How do I turn it on?
[120:13.89]I have to get a picture of that for sure.
[120:41.96]Good luck.
[120:42.84]That thing is one of Ganon's own, and it plays dirty.
[120:45.94]It defeated me 100 years ago, but only because I was winging it.
[120:50.08]Defeated me 100 years ago.
[120:51.76]I believe I'm actually saying this.
[120:53.30]Well, you see, when I played six months ago, I was okay.
[120:57.36]I was good back then, but I forgot how the game played.
[120:59.07]I forgot the controls.
[121:00.13]So it's your turn now.
[121:01.63]I haven't played Breath of the Wild in fucking 100 years, Link.
[121:14.33]This don't really hurt that much ow
[121:47.44]Need to eat something.
[121:48.04]What do I even have for food?
[121:52.70]I got this.
[121:54.40]I feel like I should have wasted all those, but I did.
[122:06.13]Alright, no mo- Okay, bomb arrows.
[122:08.91]I'm not using them.
[122:21.99]Where is he?
[122:26.91]I just needed to complete 160 degrees!
[122:30.97]With 200 added on top of that!
[122:32.85]Can I bring him down?
[122:37.23]I feel like you have to shoot the gun or something.
[122:54.84]mercy.
[123:04.28]Shit, that hurt.
[123:09.85]Where even is this guy?
[123:10.87]And why are you talking to me like in the middle of a fight like this?
[123:20.66]Any more food?
[123:22.06]What is this?
[123:26.88]Oh, this is not good.
[123:27.99]I have to dodge like everything.
[123:51.45]Excuse me?
[123:53.63]And what kind of track is this game smoking right now?
[124:00.49]What?
[124:07.09]I can't hurt him in the middle of that?
[124:10.76]What the fuck was that?
[124:13.60]I almost want to start over.
[124:14.48]Yeah, I'm starting over.
[124:16.44]What are we going to do?
[124:18.48]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[124:23.55]This kid, I just want to give him false sense of security.
[124:29.91]I'm gonna fucking crush him.
[124:42.83]Land on top of him, please!
[124:58.35]You're out of arrows?
[125:00.35]No, I got arrows.
[125:08.76]I don't know what the fuck that is!
[125:18.04]Shoot!
[125:18.24]Alright, I need the gas thing.
[125:20.29]No, go this way.
[125:27.38]Shoot, what are you doing?
[125:28.78]Why will you not shoot this?
[125:30.12]No, you don't have a bow and arrow.
[125:33.52]What are you talking about?
[126:07.83]Now's my chance.
[126:08.51]Yeah, it is.
[126:15.79]Okay.
[126:17.45]It would have been so funny if he died of his health to zero.
[126:21.40]This would be one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life if that happened.
[126:43.84]We still have an hour and 20 minutes.
[126:46.06]We still have an hour and 20 minutes.
[126:47.58]Everyone, everyone relax.
[126:49.01]Everybody just settle down.
[126:50.15]We've got an hour and 20 minutes.
[126:52.57]At least.
[126:59.79]Can you imagine if I looked over the edge?
[127:01.05]He was just falling.
[127:02.97]He fell the whole time and landed and just Dark Souls died on the ground.
[127:13.81]That would have been probably my favorite thing I've ever seen in a game.
[127:25.72]Enemies do that in Tears of the Kingdom.
[127:27.68]Nice.
[127:44.82]Will that bring me to two rows?
[127:47.32]Maybe.
[127:47.56]Part container.
[127:52.73]Oh, that's too bad.
[128:07.37]Uh, yeah, right?
[128:13.21]One row Andy.
[128:14.73]I know it's bad, but it's not that bad.
[128:26.80]It's fine.
[128:28.84]Yeah, we can't skip the major cutscenes.
[128:33.88]I'm gonna see these.
[128:37.82]Oh look, it's Revali.
[128:41.74]Revali.
[128:43.44]Well done.
[128:44.26]Well done, Revali.
[128:44.92]I suppose I should thank you now that my spirit is free.
[128:47.82]This returns Meadow back to its rightful owner.
[128:50.52]Hmph.
[128:53.26]Don't preen yourself just for doing your job.
[128:56.84]I do suppose you've proven your value as a warrior.
[129:00.26]A warrior worthy of my unique ability.
[129:02.96]And what is it?
[129:03.38]The sacred skill that I have dubbed Revali's Gale.
[129:24.21]Super jump.
[129:24.65]Maybe I can fly.
[129:26.31]Good.
[129:26.51]Crazy good.
[129:26.79]I have them all.
[129:27.43]I have all the powers.
[129:28.57]You should have done this one way earlier.
[129:31.55]It's okay.
[129:57.83]The princess has been waiting an awful long time.
[130:04.55]It's very, very good.
[130:07.42]Most people do this one first.
[130:14.88]Six months.
[130:19.94]We did this one last laughing.
[130:21.72]Why?
[130:24.20]There's no order.
[130:25.06]I thought you guys told me two years ago when I started this that it didn't matter what order I did.
[130:47.49]I kind of want to make the title of the stream.
[130:50.94]Playing through Breath of the Wild again.
[130:53.28]And then in parentheses, I don't do sequels.
[131:09.81]No, I'm not playing the new one.
[131:11.95]This is the original one.
[131:13.11]I'm playing this one.
[131:14.41]I don't do sequels.
[131:15.17]I don't watch movie sequels either.
[131:16.29]I have no idea what happens in Star Wars.
[131:22.14]What about Diablo II?
[131:22.52]What about TF2?
[131:51.72]Well, yeah, that's... Yeah.
[131:52.76]Oh, they actually changed it.
[131:53.98]Nice.
[131:54.14]Your favorite movie is Gremlins 2.
[131:57.22]Well, that makes it funnier.
[132:20.04]Armored Core 6.
[132:25.05]There's many sequels in front of that.
[132:36.17]Blusterous power born from the spirit of the champion Revali.
[132:39.71]Creates an upward draft that carries you into the sky.
[132:42.87]Activate by charging jump with B. Link.
[132:49.47]Is she under the boards?
[132:51.03]Oh.
[132:53.25]Link, I'm under here!
[132:55.70]Don't ask me how I got in here, I-
[133:18.88]I was on an adventure and I fell down in here.
[133:26.97]We were doing renovations.
[133:28.85]I got stuck in here.
[133:32.89]In fact, Link, you're standing on the only air hole that exists!
[133:36.33]Please move!
[133:41.37]Okay.
[133:46.36]Are we going?
[133:47.34]Is it time to go?
[133:49.74]So now we have to go back here, right?
[133:55.30]That song.
[133:56.31]Do I care about the song?
[133:57.27]Stop being a comedian and just go.
[134:00.25]I have to make... No, now just go.
[134:01.31]No, just go.
[134:01.73]Go, go, go, go.
[134:01.99]Right here?
[134:03.99]You're not even wasting time to be funny.
[134:05.13]Is it...
[134:17.48]No, I see what's going on.
[134:19.02]It's when we added betting to this.
[134:22.58]It's when all of you now, all of you now do not care about anything else.
[134:27.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[134:29.51]Shut the fuck up and go, man.
[134:30.59]I put every channel point I have on you fucking losing or winning.
[134:34.41]Go.
[134:34.73]I don't care.
[134:35.25]I should have done that first.
[134:44.73]Are you serious?
[134:45.39]This is like the power I should have gotten in the very beginning of the game.
[134:49.45]And I have it an hour before I'm never playing it ever again.
[134:59.25]It's okay.
[135:00.95]Alright, I did it.
[135:02.66]We did it.
[135:03.72]Very cool, very good.
[135:05.66]Light from the Divine Beast will ravage the Calamity.
[135:07.94]For now.
[135:10.28]Alright.
[135:14.45]Feel free to take what you find in that chest.
[135:16.99]What are you doing?
[135:17.67]I... There's an item in here.
[135:22.37]That sword you have in your possession.
[135:24.09]Could it be the sword that seals the darkness?
[135:26.79]A Hylian champion who fought alongside Master Revali a hundred years ago?
[135:30.76]Could that be you?
[135:34.58]It is.
[135:39.20]Alright.
[135:40.10]I got the Great Eagle Bow.
[135:42.54]I got a ton of bombs.
[135:45.37]Uh, I'm ready.
[135:46.89]I've got a full heal.
[135:49.11]What?
[135:49.77]Be honest with me for real.
[135:52.11]What is the best possible way to do it?
[135:53.92]Just teleport to here?
[135:57.60]Fast travel right here.
[135:58.72]I'm just going to go right in the front door.
[135:59.80]I'm just going to knock on the front door.
[136:06.06]I need food.
[136:09.90]Alright, what kind of food am I looking for?
[136:11.92]Is it fire?
[136:12.80]Is it lightning?
[136:13.50]Is it cold?
[136:15.54]What should I be making?
[136:19.73]Food, then go.
[136:20.49]Food, then go.
[136:21.09]I got it.
[136:21.55]Just make only health.
[136:22.87]Health, health, health, health, health.
[136:24.41]Just heals.
[136:26.49]Okay.
[136:27.21]Link.
[136:29.09]Link.
[136:31.17]Link.
[136:31.55]Okay.
[136:34.15]I have witnessed your journey.
[136:36.43]You have overcome every challenge laid before you.
[136:40.07]Ruta, Rudania, Meadow, Naboris.
[136:47.45]All of the divine beasts are now free.
[136:52.23]With the strength you have attained, I am certain you can unlock the powerful force hidden within.
[137:00.87]Go to the Shrine of Resurrection.
[137:02.41]The Shrine of Resurrection.
[137:03.53]And return the Sheikah Slate to its terminal.
[137:05.61]Okay.
[137:07.73]I have to do that.
[137:12.11]Why does that say EX?
[137:14.19]That's DLC?
[137:14.85]Alright, no.
[137:17.22]We're not doing DLC.
[137:17.92]I'm going to the front door.
[137:18.96]I need a town, though.
[137:20.98]I need to buy shit at a town.
[137:24.42]Where is there a good place to go and get some stuff?
[137:29.96]There's good food where... Okay.
[137:36.69]Is it Zoro?
[137:37.31]Where can I get good food?
[137:39.13]You don't have time?
[137:39.79]I got time for food.
[137:46.78]There's food in the castle.
[137:48.24]Is there actually like a shop or something?
[137:56.04]You hate this game and want it to be over as soon as possible.
[137:59.09]That's not true.
[138:00.90]I felt bad that I got this far without beating it.
[138:03.18]And I want to beat it.
[138:04.52]And I'm very happy with how the game has been so far.
[138:06.88]Let's go.
[138:07.46]Get your amiibo.
[138:13.99]How much time is left on the timer?
[138:15.35]Ah, there is about an hour.
[138:16.47]There's a vendor in the castle.
[138:26.85]Okay.
[138:35.13]Cooking pots in castle?
[138:36.21]So there's no vendor in the castle then.
[138:37.51]So people align.
[138:43.92]Let me just go to... I'm going to go just to here.
[138:47.28]I know.
[138:47.70]I know.
[138:48.44]Everyone's like, just go, go, go.
[138:49.48]But I want to buy some stuff.
[138:52.77]I don't trust that there's one in the castle.
[138:54.13]I feel like people align.
[139:08.44]If he goes in without food, he'll just die anyways.
[139:10.28]Yeah, I want to give myself a chance.
[139:12.09]There's still over an hour.
[139:15.57]An hour and five minutes to get to the last hit on Ganon.
[139:18.13]That's not happening, but I'll try.
[139:19.81]I'm going to speed it up.
[139:23.44]Okay, so where... I just need a vendor.
[139:25.92]I just need... Okay.
[139:29.10]General store, right there.
[139:32.74]Just straight ahead.
[139:41.66]I don't know what that thing is.
[139:43.14]I didn't want to shoot.
[139:51.41]Okay.
[139:52.37]Do I have enough to upgrade anything?
[139:53.43]Because I'm going to do this quick.
[139:55.47]If I have enough to upgrade, what's the best gear that I have right now?
[139:57.93]Probably the... I don't know.
[140:01.59]Honestly, probably the thing I had on before.
[140:05.07]Champion student?
[140:17.35]Probably all the soldier shit.
[140:19.27]Okay.
[140:20.93]Alright, can I upgrade any of this?
[140:30.05]Champion's tunic is probably best.
[140:34.09]Okay, what do we got?
[140:36.51]I can upgrade the champion's tunic.
[140:40.58]Should I?
[140:40.92]That sounds like a good idea.
[140:50.71]That'll be better than what I have on now, right?
[140:53.55]Okay.
[141:02.51]Being able to see health is important.
[141:13.18]Upgrade it again.
[141:13.74]Do I have health?
[141:17.66]If I can do it twice, I'll do it.
[141:25.42]I don't think I can.
[141:29.39]No, I can't do it again.
[141:35.73]Okay.
[141:36.87]We're going to make food.
[141:37.89]I'm putting that on.
[141:40.61]That's 20 defense.
[141:43.51]And now I can see enemy health.
[141:44.63]20.
[141:46.77]Alright, this is... I've got a good set of gear on.
[141:50.57]I'm good to go.
[141:53.70]now I need to go uh this is the shaving uh a second off now I can't just go I'm guaranteed to lose if I just go I need to get at least another two or three big heals it's you guys are saying holy you guys like go go go
[142:17.61]All of you believers need to understand that if I get to Ganon and I die, you'll lose anyways.
[142:23.68]And I think I'm gonna die more than once.
[142:26.36]So, we gotta do it.
[142:28.40]I got time.
[142:31.88]There's like apples and shit right here.
[142:33.26]This is good.
[142:33.64]Okay, where's the general store?
[142:54.62]Alright.
[142:55.58]Fire arrows.
[142:56.32]At this point, I should just take them all, right?
[142:58.64]Just take everything?
[143:06.90]Might as well just buy every single thing I can.
[143:22.47]Okay.
[143:29.81]Now, what about food?
[143:31.79]Like, real food?
[143:35.03]I'm willing to pay a premium, by the way.
[143:36.55]Different store?
[143:49.22]I don't think I have enough ingredients to cook any food.
[143:51.25]I mean, what do I even have?
[144:00.91]I think I just have to cook everything.
[144:03.85]This door with the carrot on it.
[144:07.01]Wait, this one?
[144:08.49]This has a carrot on it!
[144:09.41]Oh.
[144:25.41]There's a shitload of carrots here.
[144:34.67]Okay, hell yeah.
[144:38.72]Alright, alright, alright.
[144:39.44]We're good.
[144:41.48]Now I'm just gonna make a bunch of food.
[144:45.78]Bro is hanging out in Publix with 45 minutes left.
[144:48.92]I need to... I have to make this food.
[144:50.56]You don't understand.
[144:52.00]Alright.
[144:52.38]What's the best... What's the best recipe I can do right now?
[144:54.70]Carrot, carrot, carrot, apple, apple, apple, monster guts?
[145:01.07]Carrot, carrot.
[145:04.87]Carrot.
[145:05.23]How many carrots?
[145:05.96]How many carrots should I put in?
[145:07.84]Who cares?
[145:08.34]Who... It doesn't matter.
[145:10.22]It actually doesn't even matter.
[145:20.74]There we go.
[145:21.40]That's ten health potions.
[145:24.14]It actually doesn't even matter.
[145:25.06]Who cares?
[145:25.52]I need health.
[145:28.78]I need heals.
[145:29.70]Who cares?
[145:30.18]I bought all these carrots and I don't even know where the fuck they are.
[145:34.40]Okay, there.
[145:34.86]Okay.
[145:44.15]Okay, good.
[145:44.49]That's movement speed.
[145:45.35]Alright.
[145:46.79]Okay.
[145:54.08]What else can I use here?
[145:55.64]Let's do carrot.

[145:59.62]Butter.
[146:02.78]Wait.
[146:05.50]Shit.

[146:27.63]That's carrot, carrot, carrot, butter, egg.
[146:40.01]What was wrong with that?
[146:42.29]What was wrong with that one?
[146:45.03]Egg?
[146:45.97]Butter?
[146:49.88]This one's gonna be really fatty.
[146:51.46]What's this?
[147:06.66]Oh, yeah, sure.
[147:10.56]Ten, good.
[147:16.98]I'm just gonna put a bunch of eggs and salt in this one.
[147:25.50]I'm not wasting it, I just need to heal.
[147:40.06]Easy to make okay, this is good in stews.
[147:51.81]We're gonna do two of these We're gonna do Two of these a little bit of salt Oh

[148:15.82]Hold on.
[148:16.22]Salt, salt.
[148:19.18]And... Um... Who cares?
[148:29.08]That was not worth it.
[148:30.02]Alright, I'm good.
[148:30.86]Now it's time to go.
[148:32.54]Alright, get the horse.
[148:33.44]We're riding straight into Ganon's castle and we're gonna take it back!
[148:39.53]You guys ready?
[148:42.82]What's the fastest way to get there?
[148:44.06]Of course, right here.
[148:59.91]Just glide from the tower.
[149:01.19]Ooh!
[149:01.93]Actually, smart call.
[149:03.03]I got an hour.
[149:04.09]I have one full hour.
[149:12.72]Run past every enemy, dude.
[149:15.72]Should I?
[149:17.86]I got time.
[149:18.46]I got time.
[149:19.05]I got time.
[149:20.43]I might not have very much time, but... Where's the tower?
[149:26.91]Alright, fuck it.
[149:27.31]Yeah.
[149:28.49]Fuck the horse.
[149:29.65]The horse helped us a lot, but I'm literally gonna slide from the tower.
[149:47.56]It all comes down to this.
[149:48.42]The end of the Breath of the Wild playthrough.
[149:53.15]Over three years in the making.
[149:58.19]How do I get the quest?
[150:03.39]Destroy Ganon.
[150:42.21]That was not far enough.
[150:43.29]It's okay.
[150:47.43]We're actually not that far.
[150:54.13]There's a shrine over here too.
[151:05.32]Oh, this is going to be close.
[151:07.98]I was not, you know, let me see if I can do it in three hours.
[151:12.68]I'm kind of amped up right now.
[151:17.27]Did you go how to surf?
[151:18.33]Uh, yep.
[151:20.75]I did.
[151:21.23]Uh, I did.
[151:24.62]You're right.
[151:25.12]I don't know how.
[151:42.02]ZL jump A. I don't know.
[151:48.20]Okay, we're good.
[151:50.87]We're good.
[151:52.27]Come on!
[152:16.99]Why do I have less than 100 seconds left in Mario?
[152:19.53]Why does it get faster?
[152:20.83]Oh, no.
[152:21.25]Oh.
[152:37.64]Can I block?
[152:38.96]Okay.
[152:39.44]I could probably just kill this thing, honestly.
[152:44.38]Why would you face the... Okay.
[152:46.20]I'm locking on.
[152:47.44]He's facing the camera.
[152:50.74]Why are you facing the camera?
[152:53.23]Why did he face the camera?
[152:56.93]Wouldn't lock on turn him around?
[152:58.41]There's another enemy off camera.
[153:15.11]And why did it put me all the way back here?
[153:21.79]I'm... What just happened?
[153:26.20]You didn't save it?
[153:27.76]Doesn't it put you... Wait, did I not even do the cooking shit?
[153:32.06]You gotta be kidding me.
[153:39.67]why I feel like I've died a million times and it just puts me kind of oh you it's back to the last save point oh that's annoying oh my god well that's it it's over sorry everybody I didn't even upgrade the armor are you serious
[154:06.26]Manual saving, really?
[154:07.78]Are we still to do manual saving at the last fucking checkpoint of the game?
[154:25.03]Okay.
[154:26.13]Um, that doesn't count.
[154:27.81]I get an extra 10 minutes.
[154:29.53]No, I don't.
[154:31.09]Uh, now I have to do everything I just did all over again.
[154:34.45]Well, honestly, I much prefer, like, the FromSoftware version of gaming, where if you... Oh, dude, if you sneeze, the game auto-saves.
[154:42.14]Do you know what I mean?
[154:47.58]Give me manual saves, that's fine, but if I... Literally, if I fucking hit up on the control stick, auto-save the game.
[154:58.87]Okay, well, let me... Did I even buy anything?
[155:05.85]I don't even remember where it was.
[155:06.91]What did I actually?
[155:08.67]Oh come on, dude.
[155:11.41]Oh my God.
[155:12.42]I actually have to upgrade this again.
[155:38.11]It was an autosave.
[155:40.35]Wait, why would it not put me to the autosave?
[155:42.91]Now I'm getting frustrated.
[155:45.12]Where is the autosave?
[155:54.14]What the hell?
[155:56.74]Wait, how long ago is that?
[156:05.21]Was this even further back?
[156:08.25]Because this is on top of the tower.
[156:10.31]No, this is like 25 minutes ago.
[156:13.43]Isn't it?
[156:14.65]Yeah.
[156:17.52]Oh, come on.
[156:18.18]It was three minutes.
[156:21.58]That sucks so bad that I don't have a save within the last 15 minutes.
[156:31.30]How often does Zelda auto-save?
[156:33.38]Is it more than 15 minutes?
[156:34.30]20 minutes?
[156:43.85]Well, I'm just going to do what I just did again.
[156:46.22]It's probably when you teleport.
[156:53.44]Do I have to do all this again?
[156:54.86]The game saves every five minutes.
[157:12.43]No, it doesn't.
[157:15.24]I walked around cooked food for 15 minutes straight.
[157:25.00]Just go right to Ganon?
[157:26.86]Suck it up, crybaby.
[157:28.10]Okay.
[157:41.87]Let me go make the food.
[157:43.09]I don't want to get there and lose.
[157:46.28]So sorry that we got screwed by an autosave feature.
[157:52.80]Sorry guys.
[157:53.44]That's my fault for not manually saving before every single encounter that's important.
[158:04.83]Oh well.
[158:11.39]You could just try killing Ganon, right?
[158:13.00]I guess I could just go try to kill Ganon right now.
[158:15.40]Just run through the dungeon.
[158:17.34]That's possible, right?
[158:18.92]Yeah.
[158:23.88]I don't think I... No, no.
[158:25.16]Hey.
[158:25.96]I could try it.
[158:27.00]Alright, here's the plan.
[158:32.28]Here's the plan.
[158:32.70]His plan is the plan.
[158:33.66]Yeah.
[158:34.12]I'm going as fast as I can.
[158:37.39]Oh.
[158:49.40]Okay, go.
[158:55.32]Did I at least buy?
[158:56.34]No, I'm alright.
[158:57.31]I'm alright.
[158:59.05]I don't think I was ever going to do it anyways, but it was worth a shot.
[159:02.47]I'm still going to beat it.
[159:03.79]Even if I don't do it in the timer.
[159:05.39]I'm still going to do it.
[159:06.53]The joke of me turning off the game is not going to happen.
[159:09.85]I will complete it.
[159:12.29]Huh?
[159:13.11]Huh?
[159:17.94]You're just gonna lose a lot of channel points.
[159:21.38]Whoever bet for me to win.
[159:23.74]Alright, let's make the food again.
[159:34.21]The recipes.
[159:38.15]Okay.
[159:38.47]Okay.
[159:47.37]Now I gotta remember what the hell I even did.
[159:48.85]It was fat... Uh... Okay, it was butter, salt, and... Butter, salt, eggs, and carrots.
[160:00.08]That's a double carrot.
[160:08.56]Okay...
[160:16.95]Butter, salt, egg.
[160:18.75]Double carrot.
[160:23.97]Where are my carrots?
[160:29.17]Where are... Oh my god, these carrots are so... They blend in with everything.
[160:33.07]No, don't eat one.
[160:42.57]Stop cooking?
[160:45.27]I'll die!
[160:47.26]You think I'm gonna be able to kill Calamity Ganon with no heals?
[160:50.66]It's never gonna happen.
[161:00.37]Okay, good.
[161:19.64]Why was that so bad?
[161:21.52]Alright, only... I'm going to do one more.
[161:23.92]I should have enough after this.
[161:29.38]Wait, don't I have something that gives a lot of hearts?
[161:33.07]This one right here.
[161:34.09]I'm going to just cook that with salt.
[161:39.89]So this is just a bunch of hearts?
[161:47.90]Or should I just do it alone?
[161:51.25]Should I just do it by itself?
[161:52.48]It temporarily increases your maximum heart, so I'm going to cook it into a dish.
[161:54.76]Or should I add stuff to it?
[161:56.58]Add the melon.
[161:59.66]Just salt.
[162:04.03]Cook it alone?
[162:05.49]Just cook alone?
[162:06.19]By itself?
[162:09.01]Okay.
[162:12.75]Holy shit.
[162:14.51]Okay.
[162:15.63]I still have time.
[162:16.21]There's still time.
[162:16.87]I got time.
[162:17.27]I got time.
[162:17.95]That was awesome.
[162:18.93]Holy shit.
[162:20.79]I got time.
[162:21.17]I got time.
[162:21.49]I got time.
[162:21.77]I got time.
[162:22.07]Go to the waterfall?
[162:23.71]Bring your Zora armor and swim up to the final battle?
[162:27.59]Wait, is that real?
[162:32.67]Are you giving me, like, the speedrun strategy?
[162:34.77]Okay.
[162:42.09]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[162:43.61]I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.
[162:46.65]Any more goat butter, whatever it is?
[162:48.03]I don't know what any of this shit does, who cares?
[163:02.38]We're back, we're back.
[163:03.22]Yeah, we're back, we're actually back.
[163:04.58]Alright, now.
[163:07.56]Where's this?
[163:11.77]Go to the waterfall in the southwest of the island that Hyrule Castle is on.
[163:19.80]Go to the waterfall in the southwest island.
[163:24.98]This is cheating.
[163:28.48]I saved it.
[163:34.05]He is never going to find that.
[163:37.95]What do we got, 35 minutes?
[163:41.34]Please give us the underdog moment we've been waiting for.
[163:43.08]Okay.
[163:46.38]Waterfall in the southwest of the island that Hyrule Castle is on.
[163:49.69]Put on your Zora armor and swim up the waterfall.
[163:51.71]Keep going up each waterfall that you reach.
[163:53.17]This can be very close.
[163:55.55]Past a few guardians, okay?
[164:01.03]So from here, from Hyrule Castle, southwest of the island.
[164:07.97]So down here, somewhere like over here?
[164:11.60]I'm gonna say, like, right here somewhere.
[164:13.06]Uh, should I get the horse, honestly?
[164:27.45]The island the castle is on.
[164:29.29]Oh, so you mean, like, here somewhere.
[164:34.03]I gotta even get there first.
[164:39.52]What's the safe way to even get over here?
[164:40.92]I feel like there's a ton of those laser shooting guardians that just fire machine guns at you.
[164:45.55]My armor is different.
[164:48.25]Alright.
[164:51.87]Uh, Zora armor.
[164:52.73]That's it, alright.
[165:01.84]Save it here.
[165:02.30]I just saved it a second ago.
[165:04.82]Go to the central tower.
[165:12.36]I don't know what the hell I'm going.
[165:13.40]I've never even seen this before.
[165:16.52]I don't know where to go.
[165:20.80]I think I can get there from here.
[165:22.80]There's no bullshit in the way.
[165:30.15]Just gotta remember how you do the...
[165:42.21]ZL, jump, and then A?
[165:43.75]This thing's gonna fucking shatter.
[166:04.22]Alright, Telda, I'm coming to save you!
[166:19.04]How bad is this current?
[166:25.44]Fuck!
[166:25.64]What the fuck is that thing?
[166:34.72]Yeah!
[166:40.98]Okay.
[166:41.68]Alright.
[166:42.04]We're getting there.
[166:42.58]We're getting there.
[166:43.12]Don't aggro that thing.
[166:47.26]Oops.
[166:54.93]Bro, I'm gonna start screaming.
[166:56.35]Everybody fucking settle down, okay?
[166:59.47]Settle down.
[167:00.29]Everything is gonna be just fine.
[167:04.40]Can't get in here.
[167:08.70]I can't swim again.
[167:16.94]Don't I have the swimming outfit on?
[167:36.59]We're good.
[167:43.87]Hey.
[167:46.77]If I could get this thing away from me, seriously.
[167:48.54]You know what?
[167:51.14]Just fucking die.
[168:00.83]How do you parry?
[168:06.38]How do you parry?
[168:09.26]What is parry?
[168:11.10]It's A?
[168:13.76]I would run by, but the thing just... It's shield plus A?
[168:28.31]Okay, well, I'm just going to try to run away from the lock-on enemy that locks on you from across the entire video game.
[168:36.40]Whoa!
[168:38.30]Hold on.
[168:39.30]Don't get angry at the enemy that you hate more than anything in any video game you've ever played.
[168:42.80]How does that sound?
[168:46.12]Fucking idiot.
[168:48.10]Nice shot, stupid.
[169:14.37]I'm gonna get in there again and I'm gonna kill you.
[169:17.09]What happened?
[169:30.28]Did I do it?
[169:41.33]Skip the cutscene?
[169:44.00]I can't skip the cutscene.
[169:47.62]I want to see what Ganon looks like.
[170:15.09]oh my god this is a whole fortress guys what is aiming at me okay waterfall I gotta go this way
[170:57.61]I want to see the... No, I want to see the map.
[171:00.88]The other map.
[171:03.06]How do I see the other map?
[171:04.96]You missed it?
[171:05.42]Wait, is it this one right here?
[171:07.02]Right there?
[171:09.96]That's the waterfall right there?
[171:12.64]That's it?
[171:17.53]No, not that one.
[171:18.79]Oh, fuck.
[171:20.05]Mods, help!
[171:24.59]I don't know.
[171:25.11]I don't know.
[171:25.59]I'll try that one.
[171:39.00]That's not even a... That's not a real waterfall.
[171:47.42]You can't swim up that one.
[171:49.16]Shit.
[171:55.68]The bridge into the castle is south, but I'm going to try this water strategy.
[171:58.98]I kind of like that.
[172:02.41]Dude, that was a mist, not a waterfall.
[172:04.57]Shit, what's the... Okay, so if I go this way...
[172:13.79]There's a waterfall out here somewhere.
[172:15.33]So like down to the left here, you mean?
[172:20.37]Let me take a look.
[172:22.30]There's a lot of bullshit over here.
[172:23.48]I'm looking for a waterfall.
[172:44.45]God damn it.
[172:45.47]I don't, I don't know where, I don't know where it is.
[172:49.37]Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shit.

[172:59.82]What happened?
[173:02.10]Okay, let me eat something.
[173:05.38]I don't want to eat everything now already.
[173:07.76]Oh!
[173:15.48]This is it right here.
[173:17.86]Giving up this waterfall so I can win this stupid challenge.
[173:33.64]Come on.
[173:35.54]Alright, now what?
[173:36.86]Now what do I do?
[173:38.16]Where's my instructions?

[173:49.39]Do all waterfalls now.
[173:50.25]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[173:51.47]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[173:52.33]Let's go.
[173:55.27]Full stamina.
[173:59.76]That was very ugly.
[174:00.84]That was ugly.
[174:07.84]Waterfall free.
[174:17.47]What's that?
[174:18.49]Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[174:21.29]What do I do?
[174:29.42]Just run in?

[174:33.12]Run in, run inside.
[174:35.80]Oh my god, this really is right here.
[174:41.81]No, no!
[174:52.28]I'm right there, dude.
[174:53.44]It's still possible.
[174:54.56]We got, I got 20 minutes to beat this.
[174:58.08]I didn't believe and neither did anybody else, but I think I do believe now.
[175:05.02]Where did this put me?
[175:07.16]What did you just do?
[175:14.17]Excuse me, what just happened?
[175:17.93]What's going on here?
[175:20.41]Waterfall again?
[175:22.01]What's going on?
[175:23.65]I don't remember this.
[175:25.32]This is not where I just was.
[175:30.60]Oh, yep, I remember.
[175:31.56]Okay, I got it.
[175:33.12]Okay, come on.
[175:42.07]Here we go.
[175:44.09]Watch this.
[175:44.49]I got an idea.
[175:45.25]I haven't been spotted yet.
[175:52.35]That's fine.
[175:52.85]That's fine.
[175:53.29]Fuck you.
[175:55.03]Think I give a shit?
[175:56.13]Think I give a shit?
[176:10.64]You can't be fucking serious!
[176:16.34]Ah!
[176:16.46]Ah!
[176:19.82]Ah!
[176:47.17]Sad boy.
[176:48.07]Suck it up.
[176:49.03]I got it.
[176:49.39]I got it.
[176:49.65]I got it.
[176:49.89]I'm fine.
[176:51.97]You know what?
[176:53.41]I'm just going to be a weirdo.
[177:08.60]Wrong.
[177:09.02]I just pressed every single button on my controller.
[177:12.51]Alright.
[177:12.75]Come on, Ganon.
[177:13.23]Let's go.
[177:13.73]I got 10 minutes.
[177:16.09]Save it right here.
[177:23.15]The Sanctum.
[177:24.26]Did I actually just make it?
[177:26.90]Oh, I'm killing him right now.
[177:27.88]Let's go.
[177:28.24]I got 17 minutes to beat the game.
[177:36.06]Alright, I got bomb arrows.
[177:37.02]It's a shitload of bomb arrows.
[177:38.12]It's a bunch of heals.
[177:39.02]I have power-ups.
[177:43.76]I have to change my armor, too.
[177:51.19]That's a good idea.
[177:51.75]Good call.
[177:59.45]Whoa, whoa, ow, loud?
[178:02.91]Where did that come from?
[178:03.77]This got so fucking loud.
[178:10.27]That was loud as hell.
[178:12.11]Jesus.
[178:18.02]Dude, it's been this loud?
[178:19.98]Is it really?
[178:20.52]What?
[178:30.09]I didn't realize it was that loud.
[178:31.49]I turned it down.
[178:36.48]It's been fine.
[178:38.64]Alright, here we go.
[178:39.34]Alright, so there's a giant spider.
[178:52.77]Okay.
[178:54.27]There you are.
[178:55.71]Alright.
[178:56.03]Bomb arrows right in the face.
[178:59.01]Calamity Ganon.
[178:59.81]I'm ready.
[179:06.54]Here we go.
[179:07.00]Bomb arrows.
[179:07.56]We're going to shoot 100 bomb arrows in his face at the same time.
[179:09.82]Who?
[179:12.42]No, it's my moment.
[179:20.30]Each one of these is going to take his health down by 25%.
[179:21.86]If that's really what happens, I hope so.
[179:26.01]Do it!
[179:34.95]Get him!
[179:35.33]Yes!
[179:35.55]One more!
[179:37.85]Thank you!
[179:51.52]Alright, let's do it.
[179:52.90]I'm just going to shoot every bomb arrow I have.
[179:54.72]I don't even want to see what he has for moves.
[179:57.27]I don't even care.
[180:11.54]It actually is doing that.
[180:13.62]Wow.
[180:15.68]That's a pretty good... Okay, it's 50%.
[180:21.81]That was a great cleric beast.
[180:27.67]How many bomb arrows do I have?
[180:28.63]Like 40?
[180:28.95]Okay, let's do it.
[180:38.03]Save the game?
[180:38.81]I can't.
[180:49.16]Okay, I'm already dead.
[180:56.16]Oh my God.
[180:57.20]OK, what do I have?
[180:59.56]Heal somewhere.
[181:00.14]OK, I need this other armor on.
[181:08.50]Where is it?
[181:09.58]Right here.
[181:09.88]OK, and I also want these.
[181:17.24]And that's that's fine, let's go.
[181:21.16]Does that sound Ganon?
[181:23.52]I've got something for you.
[181:26.45]and it's 24 bomb arrows right
[181:55.88]How do you put on a new bow?
[181:57.74]How do I put a new bow on?
[181:59.14]I... What is... I don't want to... What the fuck was that?
[182:10.83]Dude, I'm holding right on the D-pad and it was holding up.
[182:14.01]This pro controller is a fucking piece of crap. ...
[182:27.99]What the fuck are you doing?
[182:30.07]What is happening?
[182:30.95]Hold... This controller is actually fucking broken.
[182:42.84]I forgot Breath of the Wild has 80 inputs.
[182:45.42]I forgot it has 800 inputs.
[182:54.88]Pfft, hairs on my face.
[183:30.29]I'm just going to eat everything I have.
[183:50.81]Now what?
[183:55.77]Oh God.
[184:02.08]Alright, I can't hurt him with that anymore.
[184:04.96]Why do I not have a shield on?
[184:06.00]What's the best shield in the whole game?
[184:08.72]What's the best shield in the game?
[184:10.22]This right here.
[184:20.13]Why is the shield not... Guys, why is the shield not out?
[184:24.75]What is happening in this game?
[184:32.71]Go!
[184:33.01]Go in!
[184:45.03]Can I hurt that?
[185:01.08]No.
[185:08.30]I can't even, why am I crouching?
[185:11.92]This game, I swear to God.
[185:25.41]How do I, how do you stop crouching?
[185:27.04]Why is there a crouch in the game?
[185:28.84]I don't think, I've never pressed the crouch button.
[185:44.09]How do I, how do I stop him from, how do I get him down?
[185:51.88]Oh shit, I can't hurt him.
[185:52.62]Okay, parry.
[186:04.17]That didn't parry?
[186:05.05]What?
[186:06.61]Why?
[186:06.97]That looked, that looked perfect.
[186:25.77]I don't know how to hurt him now.
[186:31.27]I don't know how to hurt him.
[186:39.05]He's made out of solidified shit.
[186:41.79]I can't hurt him.
[186:50.08]You have to parry it.
[186:51.10]Oh, fuck.
[186:53.44]Oh, I'm skipping this cutscene.
[186:54.66]I got it.
[186:57.44]I got time, I got time.
[187:12.27]We got it.
[187:14.53]Use that blue shield, it'll auto parry for you.
[187:17.61]That's good to know.
[187:20.35]I have all the bombs back, but I have to put all my gear back on, don't I?
[187:30.29]This will parry automatically, you mean?
[187:33.45]I don't believe it.
[187:33.99]OK, hold on.
[187:35.75]Let me get all my shit on here.
[187:37.25]That and my bomb arrows.
[187:40.83]Come on.
[187:52.03]Got it.
[187:53.41]I don't even know if I got it.
[187:54.16]What did I?
[187:55.00]Hard to tell.
[188:06.04]Is that still early?
[188:09.49]I don't know how you fucking parry in this game.
[188:11.09]Alright, do it again.
[188:36.18]Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[189:01.43]Did I not get it?
[189:01.91]Oh my God, my shield is broken.
[189:14.48]Why is... The parry, I feel like I don't get it.
[189:36.17]You know what sucks too?
[189:40.40]Is when you have the bow out.
[189:41.88]I got it right here, buddy.
[189:46.66]Is that not hitting?
[189:51.72]That happened.
[189:52.86]Yeah, shut up game.
[189:54.31]Again.
[190:06.73]Come on Gwen.
[190:10.21]Come on Gwen.
[190:24.01]Oh, those don't, you can't parry those.
[190:25.43]Alright, come on, do it.
[191:00.59]I did it, but it didn't reflect all the way.
[191:02.11]Oh my god, it's so hard.
[191:07.64]Why?
[191:08.16]I don't have a shield on?
[191:14.16]Why is this game like this?
[191:30.97]Do I not have armor on?
[191:32.63]It's too late.
[191:33.59]I can get it right here.
[191:43.71]I still got hit by it.
[191:44.73]Shit.
[191:45.11]It's going to come down to literally seconds on the clock.
[191:48.46]Shoot him?
[191:48.92]I can't.
[191:49.32]He's invincible.
[191:54.52]Where is my character?
[191:55.90]Why is the shield not out?
[191:58.54]I don't get this game half the time.
[192:22.30]Alright, shoot me, shoot me, go!
[192:27.30]Fuck you, motherfucker!
[192:37.59]No!
[192:52.38]Do it again, quick!
[192:56.04]Do it again, do it again, do it again!
[192:57.20]I did it!
[193:03.46]With 30, with like 25 seconds to go.
[193:23.02]Yes!
[193:39.71]The answer is no.
[193:52.02]Oh, there's a phase two.
[193:53.70]Of course there is.
[193:54.96]Shit!
[193:55.42]Oh, that was so cool.
[193:57.34]Can we just pretend that it was that?
[194:03.04]Oh, I feel bad.
[194:03.98]I... It was literally the same.
[194:16.06]Fuck up.
[194:17.70]Well, why can't you save more frequently?
[194:20.91]Hey!
[194:23.24]Why do I have to make ten fucking family dinners?
[194:29.38]And not get an autosave?
[194:30.42]Ganon.
[194:39.15]Ganon is born with a dark heart.
[194:41.15]He is a pure embodiment of the ancient evil that has reborn time and time again.
[194:56.51]Ten restaurant-style meals, that's right.
[194:59.67]If set free upon our world, the destruction will be unlike anything ever seen before.
[195:04.48]Uh-oh.
[195:10.80]Okay.
[195:12.64]This part's gonna be hard.
[195:13.85]I entrust you with the Bow of Light, a powerful weapon in the face of evil.
[195:22.11]Link, you may not yet be at a point where you... There's Frank.
[195:27.94]Frank, you've been there the whole time.
[195:29.18]Come on, Frank.
[195:30.88]Let's do it.
[195:31.38]But courage need not be remembered.
[195:37.68]For it is never forgotten.
[195:43.42]Is this like a dodgeball scenario?
[195:45.02]Like whoever gets to it first?
[195:50.07]The Bow of Light.
[195:52.92]Okay.
[195:55.27]Oh, this is alright.
[195:56.99]Let's go.
[195:57.59]Where's the horse?
[196:11.85]Come over here.
[196:13.07]Come here.
[196:13.71]I need to get on.
[196:25.43]Do I have infinite arrows?
[196:54.76]I have to shoot him in like where?
[196:59.64]Oh my God, it's it's because a is not where I want it to be.
[197:19.12]What the hell?
[197:34.62]On the other side, I'm imagining, right?
[197:41.89]Or no, shoot him.
[197:57.04]Oh, I have to wait.
[198:04.19]Too far away.
[198:04.77]Stuck in a tree.
[198:33.89]Okay.
[198:34.91]Thanks, everybody, for watching Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[198:37.27]The second that the boss's health goes to zero, I'm uninstalling the game.
[198:47.70]No, turn!
[198:50.82]Frank, I... You know what, Frank?
[198:52.50]I don't... Remember, B is A and A is B. Don't need them.
[199:06.26]over here come on come on over here over here quick I need you over here right now please look up there uh not come here what am I looking at oh wow on his head
[199:39.18]I did it!
[200:06.55]Hey, I beat the actual boss before the timer went out.
[200:11.40]Would you consider this an extended cutscene?
[200:21.00]I guess I technically did have to play it, and I did almost lose, so true.
[200:51.16]So how does this game leave Ganon?
[200:52.60]That's what I'm curious about.
[200:54.40]Damn.
[201:28.75]Got him in a Ghostbuster trap, that's good.
[201:32.33]Put him into the generator.
[201:37.32]We got him.
[201:40.14]Alright.
[201:43.26]Cool.
[201:53.58]I've been keeping watch over you all this time.
[201:58.15]Congrats from five years ago.
[201:59.77]That's true.
[202:00.55]Well, no.
[202:00.89]A year and a half?
[202:01.59]Time for punch-out?
[202:02.47]Yeah, we'll move to punch-out.
[202:27.56]May I ask... Do you really remember me?
[202:40.87]The Legend of Zelda
[203:04.94]Breath of the Wild.
[203:07.88]Presented by Nintendo.
[203:22.11]Alright, I did it.
[203:26.67]I beat Breath of the Wild.
[203:28.03]I told you I would do it before the year was over.
[203:40.40]My three-hour estimate was very close.
[203:42.54]It was.
[203:43.10]It just... It was a little bit of some fumbling with the save system.
[203:53.11]Is there an after-credits scene or anything?
[203:56.79]You had so much fun, didn't you?
[204:01.65]Yeah, you had so much... I think the person's making a you-didn't-have-fun joke.
[204:15.03]It was all in just no capitals.
[204:17.23]Just, yeah, you had so much fun.
[204:22.72]I did.
[204:23.08]I had fun.
[204:24.26]I had fun playing Breath of the Wild.
[204:32.30]It was fun.
[204:34.60]I had fun.
[204:37.08]I will not be playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[204:39.74]It's not going to happen.
[204:41.49]It's not going to play.
[204:46.89]Just something that's not in the immediate cards right now.
[204:53.45]And I'm just kidding.
[204:54.09]I have it installed right now.
[204:56.23]And we're moving to it immediately.
[205:01.56]That was also a lie.
[205:05.76]Don't know where the truth is in that last two sentences.
[205:09.30]No, it was fun.
[205:09.88]I wanted to play it.
[205:10.38]I wanted to beat it.
[205:12.58]Gave me an opportunity to actually see this game for what it was, which was a great open world experience.
[205:17.43]Tons of fun stuff to do.
[205:19.03]Divine Beasts!
[205:23.63]I have some complaints about the control scheme.
[205:26.67]That's it.
[205:27.97]I also have a few complaints about the... This isn't... No, not add.
[205:34.17]What?
[205:38.55]Somebody just wrote laughing my ass off.
[205:40.06]Like, oh, here it comes.
[205:47.24]No, it was great.
[205:48.06]I liked it.
[205:48.64]I liked it a lot.
[205:51.10]I'll give you something.
[205:51.76]This is the first Zelda game I have completed since Ocarina of Time.
[205:59.45]This is the first Zelda game I have played truly, actually, since Ocarina of Time.
[206:03.53]I don't really play Zelda games.
[206:06.45]I'm not really into the franchise at all.
[206:09.33]But this was really good.
[206:11.95]I liked it a lot.
[206:15.50]Is there an after-credit scene?
[206:25.10]Play Twilight Princess?
[206:26.06]I can't play Twilight Princess because it's chlorine eyes simulator.
[206:32.75]Everything, every light I look at just has, it's like I was swimming in a chlorine pool for like an hour.
[206:52.58]Okay.
[206:53.58]Alright, cool.
[206:54.44]Well, there's Breath of the Wild.
[206:55.22]Should I press a button or anything?
[207:03.96]I have heard Wind Waker is amazing.
[207:05.68]Everybody recommends that game.
[207:07.38]Maybe I'll play it.
[207:14.01]I'm glad you beat it.
[207:14.61]Me too.
[207:16.41]Hey, I'll tell you though.
[207:17.91]These streams...
[207:21.57]I think were some of the funnest streams.
[207:23.73]I feel like there was a lot of fun times on the Breath of the Wild streams.
[207:30.87]Stressful a lot of times?
[207:31.75]Yeah, but it's fun.
[207:35.93]It's one of those games that just has a giant open world with a bunch of funny stuff that can happen.
[207:39.17]I love those games, so I guess you could say I really liked it.
[207:41.38]Alright, now let me try to do the punch-out thing.
[207:49.02]See if I can do it.
[208:01.16]Tears of the Kingdom is better in that aspect.
[208:04.26]You know, it's funny because people have told me, hey, I know you like Breath of the Wild, but you'd like to see some things different in it.
[208:11.50]That's Tears of the Kingdom.
[208:14.06]So, like, is Tears of the Kingdom the Breath of the Wild that I would have loved, I guess, is the question.
[208:26.33]Not really.
[208:26.81]Maybe.
[208:26.95]Yeah.
[208:27.27]Probably.
[208:29.07]Probably.
[208:31.84]I think it really depends, right?
[208:33.06]I guess it's possible I would play Tears of the King and prefer Breath of the Wild.
[208:37.54]Maybe.
[208:37.76]I don't know.
[208:41.43]Some complaints remain.
[208:42.31]Depends.
[208:50.79]Yeah.
[208:51.29]A lot of funny stuff.
[208:54.29]That's cool.
[208:54.73]Alright.
[208:55.01]Well, I'm ready to play Punch-Out!! !
[208:58.47]I promised I would beat Breath of the Wild.
[209:00.13]That was not Tears of the Kingdom.
[209:01.25]I know a lot of people may have been like, what is he?
[209:04.83]Why is he playing this game?
[209:07.53]But yeah, finished it.
[209:09.71]Hell yeah, I'm happy about it.
[209:11.98]Alright, now let me go pee and then we're going to come back and do the punch out challenge.
[209:17.68]I'll be right back.
