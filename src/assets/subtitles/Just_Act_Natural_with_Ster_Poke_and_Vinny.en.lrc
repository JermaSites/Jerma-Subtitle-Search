[02:50.99]I'll buy it right now.
[02:54.43]Alright, I'm gonna make a game, and then I'll give you guys the code.
[02:58.28]Apparently that's how this works.
[03:04.61]I'd even buy it.

[03:10.31]No, I own six copies.
[03:16.50]Start.
[03:18.20]I just didn't want to flex.
[03:22.95]Yeah, there's a lot of game modes here.
[03:24.84]I'll start with party mode and we'll figure it out.
[03:26.92]Yeah, party mode sounded like the way.
[03:30.30]Is there a way to hide the room code?
[03:36.29]Did he say if he's going to play Oblivion?
[03:38.29]I'm definitely going to make my Oblivion character tonight.
[03:41.46]Stay tuned.
[03:44.80]Yeah, because I'm streaming this.
[03:46.02]I don't need people jumping in and it just shows the room code.
[03:50.11]Oh, you're streaming?
[03:50.87]Yeah.
[03:54.66]I don't know.
[03:55.50]It literally displays the room code and I have no choice in the affair.
[04:04.18]So that's whatever's going on there.
[04:06.66]There's this program OBS that has like, you can like scene control and stuff.
[04:11.79]I don't know if XSplit can do that.
[04:15.73]Let's see.
[04:18.88]Oh, I saw you guys arguing about XSplit and stuff.
[04:21.48]I got caught up on all the drama.
[04:24.45]Oh, really?
[04:25.39]Yeah.
[04:28.13]Let me talk better now.
[04:28.87]The secret is, when Jerma was away, he watched our horseman stream, and he watched it crying, and he missed us so much.
[04:35.41]He's trying to act like, nah, actually, you guys missed me.
[04:38.37]We were the... Yeah, we were not the horsemen at that point.
[04:43.32]What are three horsemen?
[04:44.76]What is that?
[04:45.16]Is that another word?
[04:46.93]Tricycle.
[04:48.54]We were the tricycle and the vibes were rancid.
[04:52.01]And I remember Jerma joined for like 30 seconds and he was like, man, the vibes here, guys, they're bad.
[04:57.32]And he just left.
[04:59.22]Yeah.
[05:00.20]They were pretty dog shit.
[05:01.99]I actually, I went into the room and when I joined the server, the server you guys were in, I just, it started to, my room smelled and I smelled fine.
[05:10.34]It was nothing to do with me.
[05:12.69]There's my room, my computer started like, the fan started running more.
[05:17.50]Like my graphics card fan turned on and I just started to get this.
[05:21.38]It's just like kind of like rotten milk smell and I've never smelled that from my computer before.
[05:25.14]So I was like, I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[05:28.29]I've been known to enjoy some curdled milk from time to time.
[05:35.74]I posted it in the chat.
[05:39.42]Let me post in that code.
[05:40.98]Wait, I should probably get premium.
[05:42.98]Everything's missing on the avatars.
[05:47.05]Except for this.
[05:47.85]Yeah, hold on.
[05:48.19]I'm getting premium.
[05:49.19]I'm getting premium right now.
[05:50.03]Wait, where's the avatars?
[05:51.26]You can change avatars?
[05:52.46]I want an avatar.
[05:54.16]Yeah, I'll default.
[05:55.10]Hold on.
[05:56.73]Sorry.
[06:00.41]Category still void crew.
[06:02.10]Oh, you're right.
[06:04.92]You got you.
[06:05.64]Jeremy, you need me to give that to you?
[06:07.06]I know you can't.
[06:07.94]I got it, I got it.
[06:10.14]Poor Jerma.
[06:16.09]Oh, here we go.
[06:17.03]I'm going to get so many avatars from this.
[06:23.64]I have no idea how to change my character's, like, face.
[06:32.93]Okay.
[06:33.43]I should have DLC now.
[06:34.77]Why did it open on a different monitor?
[06:38.10]That's weird.
[06:45.44]Joining with that code.
[06:47.26]Very cool.
[06:47.48]There's the rancid smell again.
[06:56.31]Going to attempt to hide the code.
[06:58.36]There we go.
[06:58.70]Yeah, making sure it's not here.
[07:00.60]Star, how did you do that?
[07:02.76]What?
[07:03.98]How'd you make your guy a skull?
[07:06.33]I clicked select icon at the top left of the screen.
[07:14.10]Oh.
[07:14.24]Oh, cool.
[07:14.66]Alright.
[07:15.00]So what do I want to be?
[07:17.18]Oh, the room code was revealed.
[07:19.91]Run.
[07:21.69]Oh.
[07:23.85]Oh.
[07:23.93]Do we leave?
[07:25.58]I don't know.
[07:26.36]Delete the VOD.
[07:27.24]Can there only be four people in a place?
[07:30.24]No, it's eight.
[07:30.98]It says four out of eight on your screen.
[07:36.87]Hey, well, the game is free, so somebody probably just fucking went and downloaded it.
[07:42.26]Are we making a run?
[07:42.90]I say we just carry on.
[07:44.92]Carry on?
[07:45.63]Bucket?
[07:45.97]I say we carry on.
[07:46.77]Yeah, just ready up, guys.
[07:48.67]Ready up.
[07:49.57]But I gotta pick my avatar.
[07:52.42]Or it could be a piece of sushi.
[07:54.48]I can't even pick my avatar.
[07:55.66]There's no option.
[07:56.54]I have no option for it.
[08:00.47]I'll do that after this.
[08:01.63]It's fine.
[08:02.89]does this have voice chat uh if it does it's going it's turned off I'm turning it off no it doesn't have voice chat we're good quick game alright I'm ready so how does this work we gotta we supposed to like be hiding from each other I think it depends on the game
[08:31.53]which is random everyone's a hider win by collecting all your four fruit types knock out other players with your melee weapon okay like fruit I guess I don't know where I am there is a giant u arrow that might help where's your arrow which one's you guys I'm the one top right
[09:01.65]I figured out who someone is because they weren't moving.
[09:06.38]Who just killed me?
[09:10.62]Was that me?
[09:12.18]Who gives a shit about hiding?
[09:13.28]Just fucking kill.
[09:19.35]Oh shit.

[09:27.38]How do you get items?
[09:30.27]how do you get this stuff oh you have to collect one of each it's gonna wipe everybody out and you'll be able to deduce who I am how the do you get the fruit just walk next to it maybe we should next time we'll specifically do that game mode where you have to act natural
[10:02.49]they're gonna put me in the movies why am I am I even in the same game with you guys that's a good question only yeah you are I I'm spectating you you're you're I see you oh it does show that you have the fruit on the side Jerma kill the pirate oh what the hell minus 19 points for what
[10:31.95]oh I think probably because you were you hitting people yeah oh I think you hit a lot of wrong people yeah what did I do how did I win something I think you just walked by the fruits you walked by the fruits yeah that's right man race to the finish line avoid detection from the seeker
[11:01.01]Alright, so just don't get picked out.

[11:14.23]I don't know.
[11:15.89]Ster has the gun.
[11:18.51]It's either Poke or Vinny.
[11:23.90]Why are they all moving so fast?

[19:44.89]What did I do?
[19:46.29]I have no idea.
[19:46.99]I just stood there.
[19:51.28]This is the screen where it shows the instructions.
[19:53.32]It says collect diamonds and act like an NPC to avoid detection from the seeker.
[19:58.38]Oh, yeah, the diamond ones make sense.
[20:01.90]Okay.
[20:02.80]I think there was one cowboy hat in the last one that you had to have control of.
[20:06.88]Oh, and you knocked them out?
[20:08.83]I had the cowboy hat the whole time.
[20:11.09]I shot someone with a cowboy hat and then I never saw it again.
[20:16.11]Father.
[20:16.39]Dude.
[20:17.35]Don't!
[20:25.74]Mm-hmm.

[27:36.41]It's angry looking.
[27:39.91]Not since Mario 3 have there been scarier sun.
[27:45.00]And that was a terrifying one.
[27:50.13]What's the scaredest you'd have been for a game that is not scare?
[27:55.56]Ocarina of Time, Nighttime, Outside.
[27:58.28]Yeah, the zombies, definitely.
[28:00.09]Yeah, I couldn't play as a kid.
[28:02.42]I had to play it, but I didn't want to because of that one part.
[28:05.22]Why did you have to?
[28:06.36]Were you forced?
[28:07.47]No, I wanted to play it.
[28:09.27]That part was just hard.
[28:12.33]I think the bottom of the well was scarier to me in Ocarina.
[28:15.94]It freaked me the fuck out.
[28:24.07]How about the Mario 64 piano?
[28:26.61]That's a pretty classic one.
[28:28.14]That one is freaky.
[28:29.64]Polk, what are you doing?
[28:33.81]don't worry about it I think I know what you're doing and it's a pretty brilliant idea wow literally just hiding in plain sight it's amazing hiding doesn't win I think it kind of did I thought you were sitting there waiting for the spawn
[29:01.28]yeah it was I was waiting for the I was grabbing the diamonds and started on the one spot I want to be this sniper again that was fun alright one second that's what it is guys I hate how fast nails grow someone did you do feces just

[29:56.98]over where the room code would be I actually did that exact thing really I did the exact thing you just suggested yeah holy crap we're all kind of Halloween themed aren't we let's realize that yeah I'm gonna do total rounds five this time so we can go a little bit more oh I we can also do you can do 24 players you know what just do it open it up who cares
[30:27.12]right just turn your chats off everybody like in game before I do it oh that's a good yeah alright press escape settings and I think no I just quit the game by accident I'm sorry I didn't navigate the menus accurately or skillfully dude that guy the bottom left host game that's me I was gonna say it was giving poke vibes yeah I like it
[30:56.16]we got a new code I'm gonna do a new code I'm sorry I'll do this one more time it doesn't matter if we show the code either does it no not really as long as you guys get in first so this is where you do the funny thing where you just type a random code in and it's not real and then a bunch of people just don't get the right game and then you put the real one in there it is fellas
[31:22.13]Again, press escape.
[31:23.58]You know what?
[31:23.92]When you're in game, I think if you press escape, you can turn the chat off.
[31:30.07]I might have leaked it.
[31:30.77]Start getting fast.
[31:31.87]Only eight players.
[31:35.86]Am I the only person who can scene switch?
[31:39.90]You guys have Steam Decks?
[31:42.21]Hey, bro.
[31:45.33]How long y'all been streaming?
[31:47.33]I just did a scene switch.
[31:52.21]Yeah, but do you guys have Steam Decks?
[31:55.35]Yeah.
[31:56.65]No, Stream Decks.
[31:57.75]What am I saying?
[31:59.45]Yes, I have Steam Decks.
[32:00.62]I have both.
[32:02.26]Yeah.
[32:04.58]Gotta use that.
[32:05.02]This is such a bad idea.
[32:06.04]Holy shit.
[32:06.60]Everybody ready up, please.
[32:08.37]If you don't ready up, I'm going to kick you.
[32:12.09]Oh, my fault.
[32:12.89]Not you.
[32:15.83]Not you.
[32:17.45]Alright.
[32:18.84]Jerma is... I unreadied.
[32:21.96]You freaked me out when you said ready, so I unreadied.
[32:30.42]Okay.
[32:35.17]We're all in a team.
[32:36.21]Let's kill the king.
[32:40.74]Oh my god.
[32:42.50]That's my message.
[32:43.60]Why is the chat still up?
[32:44.96]I thought that was somebody else.
[32:46.89]Plus me!
[32:49.07]You gave me a mini heart attack.
[32:50.43]Hang on.
[32:52.88]Why is my resolution so fucking weird?
[32:54.72]This game needs work.
[32:57.84]Oh my god.
[32:58.44]This game needs work.
[33:01.71]It needs work.
[33:03.07]I just changed my resolution to my real resolution and it just messed up.
[33:07.96]That was such anger.
[33:10.34]What the fuck?
[33:11.44]This person is watching the stream.
[33:14.94]Oh, yeah.
[33:15.30]What are we doing?
[33:15.98]What are we doing?
[33:16.38]Of course they're gonna watch the stream.
[33:17.70]They're gonna see everything.
[33:19.29]Of course they're watching the stream.
[33:20.99]Vinny, did you just get shot through the smoke?
[33:22.71]Hey, not my stream.
[33:24.23]Nobody's watching my stream.
[33:25.55]I got this.
[33:26.85]Vinny, did you just get shot through the smoke?
[33:28.40]Yes, I did.
[33:29.34]I just... No, that was my crazy shot.
[33:32.08]Oh, never mind then.
[33:35.26]Maybe it was me.
[33:37.77]Vinny, we can't see.
[33:40.31]And the game doesn't capture correctly either.
[33:42.15]This is just a fucking phenomenal experience.
[33:44.87]Hey, it captures correctly on OBS.
[33:47.73]Somebody get us out of jail.
[33:49.44]Ster, one day we're going to have the OBS conversation.
[33:56.12]That's the reason why last time the vibes wasn't happening.
[34:00.21]We're going to have that conversation again.
[34:03.09]Okay.
[34:04.77]Me and you, buddy.
[34:06.05]I won't forget you, buddy.
[34:08.40]Don't even talk to him.
[34:10.21]What he's going to do is he's going to explain why.
[34:14.21]How come you didn't do this?
[34:15.51]How come you didn't do that?
[34:16.77]You only have like three scenes.
[34:18.21]How come you didn't do that?
[34:19.06]Hey, you know what, Ster?
[34:20.78]Hey.
[34:24.58]Yeah?
[34:25.04]That's all I got to say.
[34:26.40]How many scenes do you guys have?
[34:29.81]On XSplit, I have like 15 scenes.
[34:35.77]Yeah.
[34:36.43]By the way, the game froze.
[34:40.04]So we're going to leave match.
[34:41.68]We're going to do a little bit more of this, but we're not opening it up because there's no way they're not stream sniping.
[34:46.91]So I'm going to one more time.
[34:49.31]We're going to do one more thing.
[34:52.45]I have an idea.
[34:54.51]Okay, you got an idea?
[34:55.40]Alright, good.
[34:56.48]Get in the game.
[34:56.98]I'm going to join my code.
[35:01.39]Here you go.
[35:03.11]Am I joining yours?
[35:05.15]There is no way to hide it, you're right.
[35:07.02]Yeah, I bought it.
[35:09.96]Who are we joining?
[35:12.18]Join pokes.
[35:15.43]Use the private button.
[35:17.49]Chat member, what you don't understand is that when you press the private button, it reveals the code.
[35:22.86]It's private with code on screen or public with no code on screen.
[35:27.75]Hope you guys are ready for the Outlast Trials the next time we play.
[35:31.01]Yeah, I pressed the private game and it just changed the code.
[35:34.62]Yeah, this makes no sense.
[35:49.36]You guys joining?
[35:50.69]Yeah, I'm in.
[35:52.61]This game was born wrong.
[35:55.29]Pfft.
[35:57.13]Who would say that?
[35:58.69]That's terrible.
[35:59.63]What the fuck, dude?
[36:00.45]It showed the code.
[36:01.47]Whatever.
[36:03.32]If you get in, then we're good.
[36:05.64]We have a limit of four, yeah.
[36:07.42]That's what I should have did in the first place, but I'm a little dumb.
[36:09.73]But then the code I put in is wrong.
[36:14.21]Check the new code.
[36:15.40]There's a new one, dude.
[36:17.46]All the cool kids are using the new code.
[36:20.38]Is that an eye?
[36:23.09]Copy and paste it!
[36:24.79]Copy and paste it!
[36:28.08]I did.
[36:29.34]I was typing it in one by one, dude.

[37:54.26]the construction bit oh the shit's outside like we're gonna sound a noise and you're still streaming killed me pissed me off because I never I didn't come up with that wait can you link that to me that bit I want I want to see that bit you gotta see it's so good your bit is mine now yeah it's just like why would you do just turn your stream off like go stream tomorrow like it's alright you don't have to be live

[38:31.24]Oh, yep.
[38:33.22]Oh It looks okay.
[38:36.03]Oh It looks sexy shit needs work goose on the loose Your bread Miller goose.
[38:47.44]Oh, okay.
[38:49.50]Oh
[38:56.24]Vinny, sorry, this game's been out for three years.
[38:58.04]I don't think it's getting fixed.
[39:00.14]Oh, I thought this was like a brand new game.
[39:05.57]Yeah, I think this game's been out for a while.
[39:10.61]Ster, you found this, Ster, right?
[39:12.27]You were just like, oh, we're going to play this.
[39:14.96]No, I didn't.
[39:16.64]It was Vinny.
[39:17.52]I didn't post this game.
[39:20.14]I didn't.
[39:21.14]Were you just saying act natural for no reason?
[39:23.14]No, Ster, you definitely posted this.
[39:26.45]it was what are we gaslighting me no I don't remember posting this I didn't vinny I thought Jerma did no what vinny dude you said it uh let me see time zones LOL vinny I have the screen I can screenshot right now you posting the game when did I post it uh April 20th oh
[39:59.69]that's cool anyway that's how I I got to eat you just now yeah I imagine I mean I I like I think the game's cute I think it's fun I it's just funny that we just we don't know who posted it in the chat I think Ster has confirmed it was me and I totally forgot so poke I have like a really good memory I know
[40:23.80]It's so annoying, by the way.
[40:25.95]Vinny, do you know how many times, like, a year has gone by, and I have been like, oh, yeah, man, that thing, the place, they do a good ham sandwich.
[40:35.45]And he's like, they don't make a ham sandwich.
[40:37.57]Like, oh, they don't?
[40:38.75]No, they make a ham sandwich.
[40:39.69]No, they don't.
[40:40.75]And they don't make a ham sandwich.
[40:42.02]He just knows.
[40:43.30]It's so annoying dealing with somebody with a good memory.
[40:46.30]Man.
[40:48.83]because usually you can like lie to people but when someone remembers you can't just manipulate them usually you can get away with just kind of being kind of wrong but if Ster was in the room you can't be kind of wrong you know we're talking like 80 right like 70 to 80 right what do we do here I think everyone's a killer or in a a hider who do we kill
[41:19.80]It was a little confusing.
[41:24.96]Who did that?
[41:28.04]Hey.
[41:50.39]shit I thought that was definitely one of you what damn you were sussy you were sussy I know uh why can't I kill you these tree faces are very cursed
[42:28.12]Did you do that because I got stuck on the rocks?
[42:30.79]Sure did.
[42:38.10]You're waiting for your cooldown.
[42:39.04]You're right there.
[42:39.50]I see you.
[42:40.80]He's got short hair.
[42:41.91]Short hair.
[42:43.57]Short hair.
[42:51.56]No.
[42:52.16]No.
[43:01.54]Or I want to have a briefcase in my hand with a suit on and be walking happily down the sidewalk to this song.
[43:11.35]That's like the life.
[43:12.33]That was the American dream.
[43:13.68]Yeah, and do the thing where you kind of jump in the air and your feet kind of go, your feet go one, two, three, four, five.
[43:17.95]One, two, three, four, five.
[43:18.59]You jump and your feet go one, two, three, four, five, walking forward.
[43:21.35]I want to relentlessly tickle you to this music.
[43:32.35]didn't I didn't hear anything it's fine everyone is a hider assassinate other players oh this is the same one how I don't know why I don't know why you're just moving weird I just walked in a straight line
[44:02.98]Felt it.
[44:05.16]Oh.
[44:06.04]Oh!
[44:08.24]Saw that shit.
[44:12.15]What the fuck?
[44:12.97]I suck at this.
[44:20.42]I am not good at this.
[44:36.51]Fuck.
[44:37.43]Well, you can see through the walls.
[44:39.93]If you move your mouse.
[44:41.95]Someone just said this is secret penis music.
[44:45.34]Guys.
[44:53.91]Why can I not throw the... We should play Fistful of Frags.
[45:01.28]Is that good?
[45:02.38]Oh, that is like one of the best FPSs ever made.
[45:07.02]what about the old dude what about that matrix mod the uh what on the like half like one dude Fistful of Frags about specialists or specialists specialists or action boy imagine imagine doing specialists I'd be down for that that game was awesome I want to play a Lethal League in 2v2 one time that would go pretty hard too
[45:38.95]Someone in chat recommended Sven Co-op.
[45:41.73]Oh, yeah.
[45:42.53]Which I've played, you know, a lot.
[45:44.29]That's a good one.
[45:46.75]That's a good one.
[45:48.28]Oh, I always forget I'm the host.
[45:49.38]I hate this.
[45:51.92]Sorry.
[45:55.00]Let's do Headhunters.
[45:57.33]I love the clay buildings.
[45:58.31]They look really, really good.
[46:04.22]Lethal League should be the next thing.
[46:05.84]Honestly, that game is so good.
[46:07.72]That is one of the best games.
[46:08.54]What is that?
[46:09.88]uh it's like a hero shooter pong it's the best way to put it yeah it's it's extreme pong uh where when it's two characters or four characters and when you hit the ball back and forth it's a ball that goes back and forth and every time you hit it the ball goes faster and that keeps going like to infinite it's crazy people have power-ups it's one of the most fun games of all time I still don't get this one
[46:38.24]you just need to wear the hat the longest as the shooter yes will you be playing Nightreign what do you guys think Elden Ring Nightreign well the last one wasn't so good that is that is the unfortunately Nightreign is a three uh triangle whatever you want to call it it's not four person co-op it's the triplet it's the tricycle that sucks
[47:08.45]I just don't see you guys wearing the hat what the heck you lost your opportunity someone picked it up right in front of you in the very beginning I'm the shooter yeah I know and someone picked it up right in front of you in the very beginning I have yet to see this hat also I had the hat for like a second now I've not seen it since my computer is just not rendering the hat I think it just needs work
[47:37.17]well well I've been I haven't I've been hiding you just haven't seen me well you're bug abusing I don't see you come out let me see you oh shoot yes sir where are you where were you I was hiding in between buildings oh okay
[48:04.31]Yeah, game needs work.
[48:05.95]Like, it makes the host have to press to continue.
[48:07.81]Like, what game does that?
[48:11.64]89 points.
[48:13.38]Get the fuck out of here.
[48:14.72]Yeah, I have the opposite of memory.
[48:24.49]Alright, this time I'm not going to mess this up.
[48:25.52]Everyone is a hider.
[48:25.98]Assassinate.
[48:38.75]You're moving weird as hell.
[48:39.99]Amazing.
[48:42.05]Yeah, I see that.
[48:44.28]Yeah.
[48:55.88]You can't!
[48:57.08]That was pretty good for a while, though.
[49:01.81]Aw, man.
[49:14.57]I don't even think about it.
[49:21.02]Don't even think about it.
[49:28.48]Where are you?
[49:29.22]God damn it, Sterling.
[49:46.54]I don't even think about it.
[49:55.77]Who?
[50:00.05]Did you face me?
[50:01.15]I saw you stalking.
[50:06.18]Oh, man.
[50:07.82]Hey.
[50:14.45]Nothing personal, kid.
[50:19.38]My favorite part about this song is... You guys have seen the heavy metal remix of this one?
[50:24.51]I love it.
[50:25.13]It's so good.
[50:27.66]They do like a power guitar of this song.
[50:29.56]This one here.
[50:30.25]The penis song?
[50:33.09]Yeah, it's got a couple of really good heavy metal remasters and kind of like a house kind of trance remaster too.
[50:40.58]They're pretty good.
[50:42.09]I have to keep an ear out for that.
[50:44.43]Dude, my sister came to town to Austin and she went to go see Linkin Park.
[50:50.12]She got tickets from somebody.
[50:52.92]Gigi?
[50:54.26]No, my sister.
[50:55.26]Oh, yeah, yeah, Gigi.
[50:56.71]No, my other sister.
[50:58.33]But she went...
[51:02.35]and she came back she's like oh my god did you know Lincoln park died oh she didn't know but did she say his name was Lincoln park yes oh god oh no I feel like you would hate my sister I hate the strong word it's a very strong word hey well why don't you guys pick up a diamond and none of you guys are picking up anything she just needs work um
[51:33.89]Not a single diamond collection, by the way.
[51:39.88]Terrible gamers.
[51:44.73]Why?
[51:46.82]Man, that was a charity case for your points.
[51:55.99]Okay, Mr. 98.
[51:59.65]Which one?
[52:09.04]Anything we haven't played yet, I guess.
[52:11.14]I don't think I've gotten to be the shooter, man.
[52:12.96]I want to shoot.
[52:14.42]Wait, no, I did.
[52:19.29]Alright, I think after this round I'm going to go play Oblivion.
[52:23.65]I want to make my character an Oblivion.
[52:30.32]I spent like an hour making my disgusting freak.
[52:38.81]I'm going to take as long as I need to.
[52:45.28]Did you play Oblivion back in the day?
[52:47.22]Anyone here?
[52:50.48]A little.
[52:50.96]I played quite a bit.
[52:54.63]I was too scared too.
[52:57.57]I'm noticing a trend here, Poke.
[53:00.23]yeah single player games are scare me like even like fallout playing that alone yeah it's freaky it actually kind of is it is I was a little older for some of these things but I had some games when I was a kid that scared me did you know the original metroid on the nes actually scared me a little bit because I was just like I felt like weird and alone it was kind of weird like that scared me too they're like
[53:28.85]It really kind of was off-putting in a way.
[53:32.89]Well, that was a fun game.
[53:33.83]That was fun.
[53:34.74]Yeah, it was pretty good.
[53:36.20]It was chill.
[53:37.32]Yeah, I wish there was just some competition, but it was okay.
[53:41.55]Man, you did well.
[53:43.75]I'll give you that.
[53:44.43]But a Ballfondler would have shown you.
