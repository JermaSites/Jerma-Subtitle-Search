[03:39.46]Excuse me, sir.
[03:40.72]We got a cart to push over there, dude.
[03:45.12]Mr. Jokester.

[03:49.01]We won.
[03:50.13]Oh my god.
[03:52.47]Hey, we won.
[03:56.43]Maybe I'll do another round.
[03:58.35]So I have something to talk about in my next commentary.
[04:01.15]My next real sit-down commentary.
[04:04.97]It's about...
[04:06.35]Something very, very important.
[04:08.97]Well, not really important.
[04:10.05]I just want to get your guys' viewpoints on it.
[04:13.44]I'll save the topic for... I'll probably do it in two days.
[04:18.94]What's today?
[04:19.42]Wednesday?
[04:20.32]Tuesday?
[04:21.72]So yeah, it'll probably be up by Friday or Saturday.
[04:24.64]But it's a very important topic.
[04:26.30]And it's something that really made me very, very sad in the last couple days.
[04:30.24]And we'll discuss it when that comes up.
[04:33.56]But in the meantime, I'm gonna uber this pyro, and we're gonna do absolutely nothing, probably.
[04:40.92]Get him!
[04:41.40]Get him!
[04:41.90]Get him!
[04:42.38]Get him!
[04:42.83]Flame thrower!

[05:09.81]I got you.
[05:11.51]I am Femad.
[05:14.85]You know what?
[05:15.73]For the remainder of the time, I'm just gonna go Battle Medic.
[05:18.41]See if I can't do something fun.
[05:20.45]Get out of town.
[05:21.79]Where is he?

[05:25.25]Come here, you bastard.
[05:27.81]Oh, my god.
[05:28.41]I'm sorry.
[05:30.07]For being a terrible medic.
[05:31.09]I know.
[05:31.29]I'm sorry.
[05:31.65]I apologize.
[05:35.45]You don't have to eat that sandwich.
[05:36.41]You got me, buddy.
[05:38.89]I'm your friendly neighborhood pocket medic.
[05:41.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[05:42.91]Alright, fine.
[05:44.06]You want to do that?
[05:44.84]I'll just smash you.
[05:48.50]Oh, now I got a crits.
[05:50.50]Now I got a crits.
[05:53.68]Alright, drop it like it's hot, man, down here.
[05:56.32]Here we go.
[05:57.42]Shavoink.
[06:00.24]Get him.
[06:01.06]Ah, damn it.
[06:03.28]Oh, it's over.
[06:03.90]No, no, do your right.
[06:04.88]I can't talk over chat because if I do that, my game crashes.
[06:11.47]Because I have like three things going.
[06:12.93]I got the webcam going, I got my microphone going, and I have wraps going.
[06:17.19]So like my entire world just takes like a dump on itself if I hit V. It happens all the time.
[06:24.19]It's not cool.
[06:24.79]I think we got this in the bag, though.
[06:30.55]I think we do.
[06:31.22]I think this is all she wrote.
[06:36.28]But yeah.
[06:37.04]Thanks everybody for watching.
[06:37.98]I think this is gonna be it.
[06:40.56]I will see you guys all next time.
[06:42.52]Hold on.
[06:42.88]Actually, can't say that yet.
[06:44.54]Because they just got two people on the car.
[06:45.95]Oh my god.
[06:47.11]I'm here to save the day.
[06:48.73]As the doctor.
[06:49.49]Come on.
[06:51.43]Get back out there.
[06:53.75]Overtime.
[06:54.27]This is not good.
[06:55.13]I was about to say my outro.
[06:58.64]We did it.
[06:59.38]I didn't get on the scoreboard.
[07:01.38]That's a bunch of baloney.
[07:03.78]But yeah, guys, thank you so much for watching.
[07:05.62]Really do appreciate it.
[07:07.19]I will see you all next time.
[07:08.87]So peace and take care, everybody.
