[00:01.41]Okay, here's the problem.
[00:03.83]If I say yes, I want to go play Kingdoms Rise, I know it's gonna suck.
[00:09.38]We both know it's gonna suck, and I don't want this to be on me after I just made us play Trap Dead.
[00:14.80]Like, I have enough guilt on my shoulders.
[00:18.24]If you think it's worth a shot to make a video on it, like, I will do it.
[00:22.73]I don't, like, care.
[00:24.09]But is it... Is it...
[00:27.11]No, it's not.
[00:27.97]It's not.
[00:28.47]It isn't.
[00:29.23]But, you know what, that's a- Let's go, let's go, let's do it.
[00:31.67]Let's just get this out of our system.
[00:33.59]Okay, Kingdom's Rise.
[00:34.94]You like when you hover over things and it just, like, cuts your ear open?
[00:39.24]Yeah, there- I'm looking- I can't- Go to the settings menu.
[00:44.18]Where- Oh, there's the- Ow!
[00:47.14]Ow.
[00:48.48]Ow.
[00:49.48]Ow.
[00:50.72]I think I like ambient occlusion.
[00:52.56]Ow.
[00:53.34]Dude, I lowered sound effects volume.
[00:55.67]Lower sound effects to like nothing.
[00:58.03]Ow.
[01:02.43]I can hear it over your headset.
[01:06.16]I can just hear ding, ding, ding, ding.
[01:09.38]You can hear it through the headset.
[01:10.68]Yes, I'm not clicking anything.
[01:12.00]I'm just like, wait, why is it dinging at me?
[01:14.44]Is it really that loud?
[01:16.92]Oh, there's capes and shit.
[01:18.38]Why?
[01:18.50]Is it something supposed to happen?
[01:19.52]Supposed to scream or something?
[01:23.94]Oh, shit.
[01:24.46]I just exited out of the game.
[01:25.66]I clicked the X on the top right.
[01:27.26]What?
[01:27.92]Okay, that's enough of showing the menu.
