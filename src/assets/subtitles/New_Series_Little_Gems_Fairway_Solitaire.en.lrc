[00:08.80]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:11.04]Jerma here with a brand new series!
[00:14.69]This is going to be Fairway Solitaire first and foremost, and it's going to be the start, like I said, of a new series called Little Gems.
[00:22.41]Now, what do you mean Little Gems?
[00:24.33]Well, I'm talking about mobile games.
[00:26.55]I'm talking about Android, iPhone, iPad, anything on a mobile platform.
[00:32.65]And the reason why I decided to do this is because I'm always on my damn iPhone.
[00:37.38]I'm always playing a game when I'm waiting in line for the DMV or I'm at the doctor's or something like that.
[00:42.32]I'm always just sitting on it, and I have a lot of favorites.
[00:45.14]So I guess the whole purpose of this series is to give you guys, before you buy, because I know it can be really... you never know with mobile games.
[00:52.33]It's so hard to tell if a game's actually good, because nobody really covers it.
[00:55.51]And there's not a whole lot of press on any of these games anyways.
[00:58.57]So you could buy a game that you think, oh, this looks okay.
[01:01.37]What do people say about it?
[01:02.25]It's got okay reviews.
[01:03.88]And then you play it, and you hate it.
[01:05.98]So I'll be the middleman.
[01:07.42]Let me play these games for you and give you my favorites, baby.
[01:11.16]So, Fairway Solitaire, already in the middle of this game right here in the very beginning.
[01:15.39]The way this game works, first of all, it's for Windows, Mac, that's right, you can get it for your PC, iPhone, and iPad.
[01:22.83]I actually first played this for the iPhone, and then I said, oh my god, I gotta get this for the PC too, because it's so addicting.
[01:29.02]So if you ever played Mahjong, or you ever played Solitaire, imagine this is like a strange mix between the two.
[01:35.90]As you see in the bottom, I of course have my face card, and I have to clear this entire deck, this whole place.
[01:42.54]Now I don't have to, but the thing is, if I don't clear this, look in the top left of the screen, it's kind of like golf.
[01:48.37]You can be above par, you can be even at par, or you can be under par.
[01:53.73]Hence the fairway in Fairway Solitaire.
[01:57.49]So the way it works, you have to go one above or one below the current face card you have, and you can just keep going in a chain.
[02:04.99]That's the whole point.
[02:06.03]You want to get yourself in a chain, and that's where this game becomes so addicting.
[02:09.85]It just grabs a hold of you, because you want to go 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, and it's like you get massive amounts of points for stringing things together.
[02:20.68]Not to mention the awesome sound effects that are in this game.
[02:23.64]It sounds like you're at a driving range.
[02:26.30]I love that noise.
[02:27.64]I love that noise.
[02:28.84]It just brings me back.
[02:29.66]Me and Burgah Boy used to go to a place called Starland, and we'd hit a bucket of balls, and just that steel on ball, it's... I can't explain it.
[02:37.45]It's just an awesome noise.
[02:39.05]So how you win this game, before I talk about that, I want to bring up the golf bag here.
[02:43.27]In the lower right, you're going to see there's a nine iron sitting in there.
[02:46.67]If I click this nine, it will turn the queen into a nine card, which can be insanely helpful.
[02:53.08]It doesn't stop your streaks,
[02:54.74]And it doesn't take up a card.
[02:56.54]So how you get these?
[02:58.20]You have to buy them with the game's currency.
[03:00.70]They're 500 golf bucks.
[03:02.84]Or you have to find them luckily in the world.
[03:05.02]And that's... That doesn't really happen.
[03:07.36]They don't show up that often in the world.
[03:09.24]So it is recommended that you buy them.
[03:11.10]And how you get golf bucks?
[03:12.38]You have to string combos together really well.
[03:15.36]Or I think you can do it by completing courses at a good point score.
[03:19.75]So how you win this game, you have to complete courses at even or under par.
[03:26.09]If you go over par, you will have to start the entire course from the very beginning, not the level, the entire course.
[03:34.67]So it is very much recommended that you take your time and really try to get even or at least one over or one under on the various holes of that course.
[03:44.34]Because if you go like four or five over par on one particular hole,
[03:49.42]you're gonna have a ton of catching up to do, so it's best to stay as close to even as you can possibly get.
[03:55.78]So the addiction factor of this game is at an insane level.
[03:59.86]I can't even begin to tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game already.
[04:03.09]Just like I said, sitting at doctor's offices, sitting in plane rides, sitting in terminals, anything.
[04:08.43]This game just melts through time.
[04:11.65]And that's what you want in a mobile game.
[04:13.03]I think in any mobile platform game, you want a time waster.
[04:17.41]This is a time waster.
[04:19.83]And it's got a bunch of levels, a ton of unlockables, a ton of different things you can do with the golf bucks.
[04:24.68]So there's a lot here.
[04:26.04]It kind of reminds me of PopCap games.
[04:28.76]Games like Plants vs. Zombies or Insane Aquarium.
[04:31.56]There's just a lot of stuff to do.
[04:33.37]There's a challenge mode.
[04:34.83]So I highly recommend this.
[04:36.39]It's only $3.
[04:36.73]$2.99 on the iTunes store and $2.99 on the website as well.
[04:43.75]There's also a free version of this game.
[04:45.29]It's kind of old and outdated, but it is still supported by the developer.
[04:48.93]But you can get an hour-long free trial if you go to Big Fish Games.
[04:53.63]All the links will be in the description.
[04:55.13]All the relevant things you need to know will be there as well.
[04:57.59]And also, the reason why I have the circle over the cards, that's not in the game.
[05:01.49]I put that in there after in the editing process.
[05:03.93]Because you can't see where you're touching, you can't see where you're clicking when you capture this game.
[05:08.34]So that's the reason why you're seeing that.
[05:09.52]That's not going to be on your screen.
[05:11.72]So that's gonna wrap up the video, guys.
[05:13.26]Thank you so much for watching.
[05:14.34]I really do appreciate it.
[05:15.64]And let me know if you like the new series.
[05:17.06]Let me know if you want to see more.
[05:18.36]If you have any games you want me to try that are on a mobile platform, then definitely let me know.
[05:23.19]Shoot me a comment on this video, and maybe I'll check it out.
[05:26.09]We'll see.
[05:27.01]So yeah, guys, that's gonna wrap it up.
[05:28.47]I'll see you all soon, and take care, everybody.
