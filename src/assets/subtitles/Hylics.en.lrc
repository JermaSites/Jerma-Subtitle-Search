[01:48.89]Anyways, how you doing?
[01:50.54]Welcome to another stream.
[01:53.80]Got a lot to go over today.
[02:00.86]First of all, let's talk about this.
[02:07.57]Playing Hylics tonight, you probably saw by the incredible title, which I have not updated.
[02:15.29]One of the mods will fix it.
[02:16.67]Probably like an hour.
[02:21.86]Oh yeah, I. It is the way it is the way that it's going to be for now.
[02:28.23]Yeah, I've heard this game is very weird.
[02:30.49]And told it's going to be right up my alley.
[02:31.95]It's not that long, but we'll see.
[02:34.37]Heard that before.
[02:38.31]But it's very good.
[02:40.95]There's also a sequel, so if I like this then.
[02:44.08]I have probably played the sequel at some point.
[02:50.14]We have Grotto Beasts stuff to go over a little bit later as well.
[02:55.16]Kind of a secondary clarification and amendment to the FAQ we saw a couple days ago.
[03:02.41]A lot of really good news with Grotto Beasts.
[03:05.87]I'm also going to show the box today.
[03:08.87]I'll make sure to show you what you're getting.
[03:11.01]There are some things missing from this box.
[03:15.15]because they were... Never mind.
[03:20.35]I don't think the group chat is going to be mad at me if I say anything else.
[03:25.32]Yeah, some things are missing from this box.
[03:26.72]I just want to give you a basic idea of what you can expect.
[03:38.27]But that's the plan.
[03:40.19]That's the plan for today.
[03:42.03]No, this is not an unboxing.
[03:45.85]This is not an unboxing.
[03:46.99]This is essentially, these are printing samples, is what these are.
[03:53.55]Because everything is still in production right now.
[03:56.03]So these are printing samples.
[03:57.17]I just want to show you what you're planning on getting.
[04:05.37]Now there's, I'm not going to be, there's no pack openings.
[04:07.47]That's not, I'm just, this is, these are printing samples for you to see what is being printed.
[04:19.05]Unbox, please.
[04:20.83]It doesn't exist.
[04:21.86]I'm telling you.
[04:24.34]Alright.
[04:24.56]But anyways, very excited.
[04:26.54]It's been going incredibly well.
[04:29.60]Everybody on the Grotto Beasts team is completely blown away.
[04:32.94]It's been more than we ever thought.
[04:35.45]So we will go over it all.
[04:37.97]But I want to obviously not do it immediately.
[04:40.03]I'm going to do the same thing like we did a few days ago.
[04:41.69]I'm going to play Hylics for a little bit.
[04:43.73]And then we'll move into that.
[04:47.49]So, let's go.
[04:47.99]You guys ready?
[04:50.74]Heard this game is a little weird.
[04:53.64]But let's just chill and play it.
[04:57.32]It's going to be kind of a chill stream today.
[04:59.58]Well, besides maybe the Grotto Beasts stuff.
[05:02.18]But I kind of want to just relax.
[05:04.09]So, that's what we're going to do.
[05:06.55]That's the plan.
[05:11.51]Let's see what we got here.
[05:13.59]There it is.
[05:18.69]I wonder how loud this game is going to be.
[05:20.39]I got to get comfortable.
[05:27.33]I got to get comfortable.
[05:30.86]I think it's arrow keys.
[05:33.08]Yeah, I'm not comfy right now.
[05:34.68]This is bullshit.
[05:37.46]There we go.
[05:37.78]Alright, let's get started.
[05:42.89]Here we go.
[05:45.15]Cool.
[05:46.41]Hilux.
[05:48.74]If you want me to explain what this game is... Um... I don't... I have no idea.
[05:55.68]All I know is that it's a game.
[05:57.79]Let's go.
[05:59.65]Okay.
[06:12.66]A psychic gland miraculously purifies the chemicals.
[06:17.52]People hark out of a field.
[06:26.46]It is a chemical below a product.
[06:28.22]It is a memory.
[06:31.21]Beside truth.
[06:33.57]Meanwhile, Gibby, King of the Moon, works a engine.
[06:37.87]Beside the shrunken vessel memory.
[06:41.71]A title?
[06:42.33]What?
[06:49.07]You guys are gonna get me in trouble.
[06:53.52]Thus your story begins.
[06:57.42]Act one OK.
[07:01.62]Interesting.
[07:02.08]So it's arrow keys or WASD arrow keys.

[08:00.93]What did I learn?
[08:01.63]Is this a horror game?
[08:10.65]I don't think it's a horror game.
[08:13.96]I think it's more of a surreal experience.
[08:18.14]Learned ablative hollow pleather.

[09:16.97]Warm burrito was found.
[09:18.73]Wait, what?

[09:36.24]Alright, do I have a, okay, hold on, yeah.
[09:39.74]I did, as you see, I did just want to make sure that I could capture this game, so I did open it for like two minutes.
[09:46.06]I didn't do anything, I didn't touch anything.
[09:48.04]But we can just save over this.
[09:51.59]There we go.
[09:54.79]Uh, things.

[10:34.33]Okay.
[10:46.68]Come here.
[10:50.70]Chip, chip, chip.
[10:56.28]Oh, where?
[10:57.26]Are these just animals?
[10:59.28]Acquired a vegetable.
[11:03.98]Ooh, okay.
[11:04.58]Can I take them all?
[11:05.88]I think I can.
[11:07.96]Is this bad?
[11:09.62]Is this bad?
[11:15.01]Should I not be doing this?
[11:26.41]Is this just kind of like a garden?
[11:27.49]Like a vegetable garden or something?
[11:31.21]Things.
[11:32.43]Oh, shit.
[11:32.73]I have 13 vegetables.
[11:33.69]50% of flesh and removes negative status.
[11:36.65]Okay.
[11:38.30]Well, actually, that is a good thing to have.
[11:39.52]This is a weird house.
[11:48.44]Okay, hold on.
[11:52.86]What about back here?
[12:00.70]He's finally playing it.
[12:01.92]I know, a lot of people were waiting for this.
[12:03.22]Alright, who are you?
[12:07.72]To the northeast is the juicy city of Bangrifrit.
[12:11.62]May its apparel endure a thousand years.
[12:17.62]Inside correct fire, but far beyond government.
[12:20.40]What doth Delakitly remember our sustenance of field?
[12:27.76]To the northeast is the forbidden city of Azulnurpan.
[12:31.62]May its vacuum endure.
[12:33.10]What's going on?
[12:41.37]Change the soundtrack?
[12:42.23]Is this guy just dancing in here?
[12:48.93]Wait, how do I get out of here?
[12:51.44]Ooh, I like this song.
[12:53.52]Oh, it's just random.
[12:54.38]Okay, it's random text generation.
[12:55.60]That's funny.
[12:55.98]I don't want to miss any Easter eggs.
[13:09.91]Whoa, okay.
[13:12.83]Where do I go?
[13:19.25]The Forbidden City.
[13:23.97]Actualize despite another crystal.
[13:27.73]Extrude below her sound, not below her product.
[13:34.42]Why are we so weird?
[13:37.08]Remarkably falsify burning.
[13:41.49]Texturized, he considers near Hylik memory.
[13:44.27]What is Hylik?
[13:46.03]Wait, like Hylik?
[13:47.89]Ahead lies Mount Mournfoof.
[13:50.46]Beware of the wicked cone cultists.
[13:52.10]Do all these things talk?
[14:02.20]Welcome to Azul Norpen, the Forbidden City.
[14:06.04]I grow the insects.
[14:07.66]Chest over here.
[14:09.87]There's a stick of dynamite in the box.
[14:11.25]Of course you take it.
[14:12.05]Yep.
[14:13.85]Hold on.
[14:14.05]What about over here?
[14:15.79]We can go up here.
[14:20.86]Let's pardon fate.
[14:32.00]He's pleasantly smearing another wheel's concavity.
[14:40.54]Oh, what?
[14:48.44]You want to use the tub, it's going to be 25 bucks.
[14:51.16]No, thank you.
[14:52.00]You stink.
[14:55.93]No, I'm not spending that.
[14:56.93]I like this letter.
[15:00.05]Wow.
[15:08.77]So do I need to talk to anybody?
[15:09.83]Like, should I be talking to anyone?
[15:11.69]Or is it just kind of just random nonsense?
[15:14.80]You can learn special abilities from the televisions which are scattered throughout this realm.
[15:18.06]Ah.
[15:23.12]Sorry, I did that already.
[15:23.80]I got one.
[15:26.42]When fighting a flesh stash, you must attack, then rest, and then guard, lest you suffer the creature's... Really?
[15:32.53]Really?
[15:35.11]Torso?
[15:35.23]Should I buy one of these?
[15:36.32]Is it worth getting some of this stuff?
[16:06.33]Looks like it can take about one or two hits, and then it's gone?
[16:08.49]3,000 bucks?
[16:13.46]What the hell are you talking about?
[16:16.28]You only have 53 bucks, yeah.
[16:17.52]Uh, no, I don't want it.
[16:24.75]It's too expensive.
[16:36.86]Please speak at me over the counter.
[16:38.45]Oh, sorry.
[16:39.31]Have you heard about our bleak cellophane?
[16:46.63]Cliff describes this as a mil-spec bio-mod.
[16:49.55]Allows wearer to wield two weapons.
[16:53.08]Formed into a nugget for easy portability.
[16:54.80]20% of wearer's normal attacks inflict poison.
[16:56.88]Okay.
[17:00.46]So it's a bunch of... Okay, this is a bunch of, like, status armor.
[17:02.68]Ooh, wait.
[17:05.54]Television.
[17:06.82]Television.
[17:07.91]Microwaves of... Yeah.
[17:09.75]You don't have frozen... Yeah, I do!
[17:11.99]Oh, no, that was a toilet burrito.
[17:16.33]Frozen burritos can be effective projectiles.
[17:18.07]Feel safe when you walk outside.
[17:19.48]Oh, what?
[17:28.54]50 bucks.
[17:31.74]Nice title, dude.
[17:33.02]I didn't make the title.
[17:33.93]My title is really boring and plain.
[17:36.37]Was there another way to go?
[17:47.85]I had a perfectly plain title.
[17:50.83]It was plain.
[17:55.05]Let me ask you guys something.
[17:58.55]When you get a bagel, do you get a plain bagel or does it have to be something wacky?
[18:03.81]When was the last time you had a plain bagel?
[18:08.40]Just a plain, just regular bagel?
[18:13.06]I feel like to me it's gotta be, there's gotta be something on it.
[18:15.34]Everything bagel, seeds.
[18:19.81]You know, like, cheese on it and stuff.
[18:22.71]You know, they bake them with stuff in it.
[18:25.19]I'd like a plain bagel, but I don't think I've had one in a long time.
[18:27.25]It's usually like an everything bagel.
[18:29.68]Onion bagel, yep.
[18:30.60]Onion bagel, everything bagel is what I buy.
[18:32.40]I don't buy plain bagels.
[18:35.08]Kind of interesting.
[18:38.32]Alright, so I did that.
[18:39.70]I've seen this.
[18:40.24]I need an instrument.
[18:47.67]Should I buy this?
[18:48.11]Should I buy the bat?
[18:49.57]I'm going to buy it.
[18:50.59]I don't care.
[18:52.01]It's probably stupid.
[18:52.85]People are going to be really mad at me about it.
[19:06.19]There we go.
[19:08.27]Wait, this is like... I have weapons and items.
[19:18.65]What over here?
[19:20.47]Oh, trash!
[19:22.30]Found meat.
[19:26.96]Those of you that have been around for a long time, do you remember that was a sub sound for a while?
[19:38.45]That was one of my favorites.
[19:41.97]Okay, let's go.
[19:47.11]Wait, I didn't go in here.
[19:49.45]You're the bug guy, right?
[19:50.85]She's more beast than prison now.
[19:53.77]Did I go in here?
[19:55.63]Yes.
[19:55.85]Alright.
[19:56.33]So let me leave.
[19:57.11]I got what I wanted.
[20:02.60]Let's explore the rest of this place.
[20:06.98]The bird sound?
[20:08.28]You know, the bird sound, I actually am sad that I did, because a sub sound is like, okay, everybody pause for a second.
[20:15.36]The funny line is gonna be said.
[20:19.01]The bird sound ruined old streams, because it was just noise that just would happen randomly.
[20:26.23]Instead of it being like, I'm in the middle of saying something or talking, it's, oh, hey guys, and by the way, here's what we're, whoop, rah, the trash man.
[20:35.65]Everybody stops, and we just listen to it for a second.
[20:38.85]But eventually it got to a point where it was so in the background that you were just randomly talking over me would be like, I've gone back and watched old VODs and gone, oh, turn that off.
[20:57.01]Okay, so I looked at that.
[20:57.81]Let's look at this.
[20:58.45]Can I go that way?
[21:04.94]Whoa.
[21:08.00]Can I not leave yet?
[21:08.66]Can we just listen to this for a second?
[21:18.70]You watch yourself?
[21:20.98]No, but sometimes I'll go back and just check on old VODs and stuff.
[21:24.17]You know, you never know.
[21:24.81]I just want to know.
[21:25.69]I want to see what kind of... Because something interesting too is I've been doing this for like 12, 13 years now.
[21:33.77]It's kind of interesting sometimes just to go back and be like, what was I like like five years ago, two years ago, eight years ago?
[21:39.41]Interesting sometimes.
[21:40.15]So I'm looking at old photos.
[21:48.09]I mean, I don't do this that often.
[21:49.77]This is maybe like once every year or two.
[21:53.87]I'll go back and look at some stuff.
[22:00.54]Interesting.
[22:04.58]We've done this on stream before.
[22:06.14]What do you mean?
[22:07.34]Mysterious tower.
[22:08.18]Okay.
[22:18.46]Do not touch the ambulant skulls or you will die.
[22:26.58]To initiate warp, make contact with the central node.
[22:29.18]Unauthorized access is discouraged.
[22:31.01]Thank you for understanding.
[22:34.07]Am I going to fight?
[22:38.95]Mirror delusions may rock this sort of chemical.
[22:46.66]Warp access is currently infested.
[22:48.56]Creatures fear the dotted red line.
[22:50.52]It will not cross it.
[22:51.62]Enjoy your time in the warp access.
[22:54.84]Like a safe zone?
[22:59.22]What is going on?
[22:59.70]Are these enemies?
[23:03.56]These are enemies.
[23:05.56]Okay.
[23:19.64]Whoa!
[23:24.04]Oh my god, I'm gonna die!
[23:25.22]How do I run?
[23:29.91]How do I run?
[23:30.37]I'm gonna die.
[23:31.37]I think I'm gonna die right now.
[23:32.59]When was the last time I saved the game?
[23:33.65]How do I run?
[23:34.03]I haven't saved the game in like 20, 30 minutes.
[23:36.73]How do I run?
[23:38.15]You can't?
[23:39.48]Am I in trouble?
[23:43.32]Wait, I can eat a bunch of vegetables.
[23:54.62]Am I alright?
[23:55.52]Should I just... You can't run.
[23:57.58]Should I just eat vegetables and just make it happen?
[24:10.43]Wayne was slain.
[24:14.05]What?!
[24:21.53]What the hell just happened?
[24:27.48]So this is the afterlife.
[24:28.86]Feel free to crash on the couch.
[24:34.95]You can use the machine over there to convert any meat you found into flesh points.
[24:41.82]I have meat.
[24:43.62]Oh.
[24:43.70]That's cool.
[24:57.99]And these are fast travel points.
[25:00.93]I get it.
[25:01.31]But where am I?
[25:01.91]Where did I end up?
[25:11.91]Hot dog was found.
[25:19.81]Creepy.
[25:21.61]You can build sand castles on the beach.
[25:23.23]Try using the space bar.
[25:30.85]Oh, cool.
[25:31.59]Alright, hold on.
[25:32.57]I don't care if this takes me like half an hour.
[25:48.13]Oh, sorry.
[25:53.11]Nice.
[26:07.13]No, I want I want just like yeah like that.
[26:10.24]There you go.
[26:20.37]That's not bad.
[26:20.89]Toss fish into the ocean.
[26:27.13]No.
[26:31.78]Is it hurt?
[26:36.54]Okay, well, yeah, maybe you belong in there.
[26:48.89]You alright?
[26:54.73]I didn't know this was... I thought this could have been poison for all I know.
[26:57.29]What is going on in here?
[27:07.32]I think I can hear a TV set behind this wall.
[27:09.46]If I had dynamite, I could... Let's go.
[27:21.04]This is where you learn abilities.
[27:25.30]Let's watch.
[27:31.36]Learned calibration.
[27:32.54]I love this game.
[27:35.30]Hylics 2 is also really good.
[27:40.63]Oh, I'm into it.
[27:41.87]I'm into it for sure.
[27:42.55]Alright, powers.
[27:47.93]Okay, guards and heals 30%.
[27:48.89]Temporarily increases in mightiness.
[27:52.75]Ooh.
[27:55.07]Very cool.
[27:56.83]Let me actually save it, though.
[28:02.67]Cool.
[28:06.09]Bro, are you high?
[28:07.23]No.
[28:07.91]No.
[28:12.11]Wait, what are you doing back out here?
[28:18.89]Are you drunk?
[28:19.55]No.
[28:25.13]Like I told you, for the last, like, couple of years, the last, like, year and a half, two years, I have not at all.
[28:30.98]It's just, I have such attention problems in the first place that it became really clear that I was just fucking myself up so bad, even just by taking a little sometimes.
[28:44.44]So it's just like, no, no, not anymore, not anymore.
[28:52.10]Can I throw these into the ocean?
[28:59.32]Wait, rest on the couch.
[29:01.68]Take a nap?
[29:02.16]Yeah, take a nap on the couch.
[29:06.05]This is probably full heal.
[29:08.97]Yep, okay, so that's a full heal.
[29:16.69]Responsible Jerma.
[29:20.21]Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[29:24.32]Touch an active crystal to tether the portal.
[29:31.89]Oh, this is where I'll be teleporting to.
[29:33.67]Alright, let's go to the orange one.
[29:39.21]Very cool.
[29:39.99]Alright.
[29:40.79]This game just leveled up and me caring about it.
[29:53.50]Juice box.
[30:01.48]This is back in the city, but I didn't have the juice box.
[30:05.06]Alright, so this... So this is like the town with the shops.
[30:13.57]This is my house.
[30:15.21]This is some kind of monument or tower or something.
[30:18.51]This was where I got killed.
[30:21.67]So... Where do I go from here?
[30:26.33]Go back to that other place and just try not to die?
[30:33.57]Or try to avoid, don't fight anything?
[30:34.81]Just avoid stuff?
[30:40.46]Yeah.
[30:48.34]Ugh.
[30:51.70]So many of them.
[30:58.71]Access warp?
[31:00.57]Where we going?
[31:03.07]Oh god.
[31:08.01]What is this thing?
[31:10.64]I found a paper cup.
[31:15.06]What is that?
[31:15.74]Well, I know what a paper cup is, but what is that fucking brain?
[31:33.27]Mysterious glyphs and vegetal motifs adorn its mood.
[31:37.75]So this is a key.
[31:39.31]Okay.
[31:48.10]Oh dear.
[31:57.80]I'm kind of scared about where I am right now.
[32:01.36]If I touch these, is it a fight?
[32:08.59]I don't want to touch anything.
[32:12.29]Oh, no.
[32:12.59]Okay, good.
[32:15.55]Somebody's house over here?
[32:20.91]No?
[32:25.73]It is somebody's house.
[32:26.29]You got a lot of money in there.
[32:27.15]Alright, do you want a paper cup?
[32:31.68]Um, this vault is off-limits.
[32:32.88]Please go away.
[32:33.84]Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
[32:38.25]It's like, I'm gonna have to destroy you if you don't leave.
[32:40.49]Holy shit.
[33:06.40]Oh, yeah, yes.
[33:10.78]That's weird.
[33:11.42]Everybody missed.
[33:16.45]22.
[33:21.27]Oh, I'm going to reload.
[33:27.33]I'm going to reload.
[33:27.84]I just want to see what happened.
[33:28.72]I just want to see what happened.
[33:30.96]I'm reloading.
[33:40.55]I promise I won't save scum.
[33:43.55]Uh, how do I... Oh, I can't save scum.
[33:50.04]Yeah, I don't know.
[33:56.00]Dying... Okay, you're supposed to... Alright, I get it, I get it.
[33:59.08]But I wanna... I wanna go back there.
[34:09.90]I mean, does the yoinky-splinky?
[34:12.94]I think that's not quite that.
[34:15.02]Plus, the yoinky-splinky is something I... You guys gave that term to a little thing I did on the Dollhouse stream.
[34:23.91]I mean, that wasn't a dance.
[34:26.29]That was just... You guys called it that.
[34:30.02]So, I mean, is that really a dance?
[34:34.84]I said it?
[34:42.49]Did I make that up?
[34:43.31]No, I didn't.
[34:43.75]Alright, so I think I saw everything I need to see here.
[34:49.15]Let me see.
[34:49.55]What about the paper?
[34:54.82]Can I take the paper cup anywhere here?
[34:55.98]I feel like I might be able to.
[35:03.46]Can I go that way?
[35:04.18]Like up there?
[35:06.20]Wait.
[35:08.21]How do I get down there?
[35:15.21]Alright, I gotta find a way up there.
[35:16.87]Get out of the way!
[35:53.80]Okay.
[35:57.08]The cult permits nothing to leave Mournfuth.
[36:00.65]In this way, they hope to promote a reverse erosion.
[36:02.83]Okay.
[36:04.19]What's this stuff?
[36:14.02]Everybody's hitting the yoinkies flanky.
[36:17.96]Oh, this is Mount Mournfuth.
[36:22.86]These enemies?
[36:28.90]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[36:37.01]50 bucks.
[36:38.39]Does it have controller support?
[36:40.23]Can I plug my controller in and move?
[36:42.45]Or no?
[36:43.23]No?
[36:43.53]Okay, I doubt it.
[36:58.66]What about this?
[37:03.60]So should I just be avoiding enemies because I'm not strong enough?
[37:05.70]I'm just collecting money.
[37:08.00]Uh oh.
[37:14.00]Oh, teleporter.
[37:18.82]Yes.
[37:22.19]What is going on in here?
[37:24.17]Is this TV?
[37:26.97]That's a TV, isn't it?
[37:29.24]Is that not a TV?
[37:31.28]Sleep here?
[37:31.82]Paper cup?
[37:33.28]If I sleep in here... What do I do with this?
[37:56.15]Is this a TV?
[37:57.17]I don't think this is a TV.
[38:02.55]The cup!
[38:02.93]You found it!
[38:04.25]I'm an expert in the usage of the paper cup.
[38:06.55]Please allow me to accompany you.
[38:08.31]One day we may come across another artifact from the old times, which will require the paper cup.
[38:15.77]Uh... Okay?
[38:18.21]Magnificent!
[38:18.75]I will guide you when the time comes!
[38:20.21]Is this a new party member?
[38:27.73]What do you have?
[38:35.50]Dirk?
[38:36.20]Party member.
[38:42.26]Can you watch this TV?
[38:50.51]What if we sleep?
[38:53.09]What happened?
[38:57.42]What just happened?
[39:01.70]Where on Earth are we now?
[39:03.04]What is this?
[39:03.54]This is weird.
[39:05.02]What's the X for?
[39:24.71]Okay.
[39:25.83]Is that an enemy?
[39:26.41]I don't know what's an enemy or a friend.
[39:28.59]I am the Sage of Brains.
[39:31.29]I grant you my token.
[39:33.37]Got Sage's token.
[39:36.23]Seek my siblings, the Sage of Computers and the Sage of Death.
[39:38.94]They will also give you tokens.
[39:41.20]For therein lies the path to the Enlightenment.
[39:45.14]Nice.
[39:46.38]This is the life.
[39:48.36]This is the life.
[39:48.98]I like the little birds.
[39:51.74]These are cute.
[39:52.21]I like them.
[39:55.81]Alright.
[39:56.07]I feel like that's important.
[40:06.21]Interesting.
[40:12.75]Should we use the paper cup here?
[40:15.12]We can use the paper cup with this machine.
[40:16.54]Your companion places the paper cup into a recess on the front of the machine and presses a small blue lever.
[40:23.40]Fluid flows from the reservoir into the paper cup.
[40:27.04]You drink it and your will is permanently increased by 25 points.
[40:31.41]Oh, hell yeah.
[40:34.63]Nice.
[40:39.63]Very nice.
[40:40.09]Maybe we could fuck some stuff up now.
[40:45.42]Do you think I'm strong enough?
[40:49.04]I've got two people here.
[40:54.36]I'm going for it.
[41:00.48]Okay, we've got attack cone cultist.
[41:06.06]Attack cone cultist.
[41:10.89]Alright, I can do it.
[41:21.23]I love the snap.
[41:22.29]It's cool.
[41:25.15]What about, um... I think I'm alright.
[41:31.32]Alright.
[41:32.80]Wayne's crew was victorious.
[41:34.86]150 bucks!
[41:43.59]Who died?
[41:44.21]Oh, I thought it was... Wait.
[41:46.49]Can I, like, do anything with that?
[41:48.55]That thing's scary.
[41:49.05]I don't like that thing.
[41:55.69]Alright, do you have any special attacks?
[41:56.73]Panorama.
[41:59.47]Can confuse enemies.
[42:00.85]Let's try it.
[42:01.33]Okay, confused.
[42:09.90]Oh shit.
[42:29.52]Use vegetable.
[42:31.10]That's cool looking.
[42:37.23]I think I'm alright.
[42:38.41]Yeah.
[42:38.81]Let's kill.
[42:40.95]Take another vegetable.
[42:46.09]Good.
[42:59.75]And clean it up.
[43:00.49]Good.
[43:05.45]150 bucks.
[43:06.51]Frozen burrito.
[43:07.27]Meat, meat, meat.
[43:08.11]Alright, easy.
[43:10.43]I don't want to aggro that thing.
[43:11.79]Alright, alright.
[43:13.34]I'm good for now.
[43:13.74]I'm good for now.
[43:14.26]I don't want to die.
[43:14.96]There's a TV right here.
[43:19.82]Get over here.
[43:20.54]Get over here!
[43:27.06]Space shurikens.
[43:30.98]Cool.
[43:32.70]This game looks neat.
[43:34.96]This game is pretty neat.
[43:37.01]I don't want to miss anything, though.
[43:39.61]Hold on.
[43:40.49]Shit.
[43:43.85]Alright, I don't want to get, like, collapsed on.
[43:48.64]Is that it?
[44:00.35]Okay, yeah, that's it.
[44:05.09]I got a lot of money.
[44:05.79]I'm gonna go buy stuff.
[44:07.57]Ooh, there's more money.
[44:11.71]Money.
[44:12.81]Money.
[44:14.39]You found 50 money.
[44:25.69]Make sure I don't miss it.
[44:26.47]Yep, see?
[44:27.09]It's kind of like a maze, too.
[44:29.53]It's fun.
[44:32.93]If I aggro this thing, am I dead?
[44:34.95]Dead, dead.
[44:35.76]Like, no.
[44:36.36]Like, guaranteed.
[44:37.36]Oh, fuck.
[44:42.46]I'm terrified of this thing.
[44:43.42]I don't know how strong it is.
[44:44.18]103 bucks, damn.
[44:47.15]Uh, let's take out one more.
[44:49.27]Uh-oh, what is that?
[45:03.69]Double damage.
[45:07.83]And... Vegetable to Wayne.
[45:10.63]44!
[45:13.09]Uh-oh.
[45:14.55]Uh-oh.
[45:16.97]Alright, we're good.
[45:26.49]Cone statue?
[45:27.17]That thing's gotta go first.
[45:37.64]I think it's got a lot of health.
[45:38.84]I think we're alright.
[46:00.73]Yeah, we're good.
[46:03.18]175?
[46:03.44]Meat, meat.
[46:05.46]A lot of meat for the meat grinder.
[46:08.95]He said it.
[46:09.45]Oh my god, he said it finally.
[46:10.89]Finally.
[46:13.68]Look, click, click that.
[46:16.34]Get that part.
[46:18.04]Drag forward to a timeline.
[46:19.38]Click the end of that.
[46:20.46]12 seconds.
[46:21.14]Got it.
[46:21.92]Upload.
[46:23.12]Is there any more money?
[46:40.53]I thought there was more money somewhere.
[46:41.65]Yep.
[46:44.65]I'm going to have to fight.
[46:50.27]Okay, this is not great.
[46:56.96]Probably causes enemies to fall asleep.
[46:59.00]Let's try it.
[47:14.13]Damn it.
[47:15.47]Oh, no, we're good.
[47:15.89]Did they all fall asleep?
[47:20.75]Okay, two of them did.
[47:28.47]Alright, we gotta do some damage.
[47:32.59]Calibration on you.
[47:34.83]And then you do shurikens.
[47:39.25]Here it is.
[47:40.07]Oops.
[47:40.89]I don't know the order.
[47:41.41]Oops-a-daisy.
[47:48.61]Wait, they all got it.
[47:49.63]Wait, why did they all get it?
[47:50.53]They all got it.
[47:51.21]What just happened?
[47:52.83]They all just got it.
[47:55.97]Why did this do it to everybody?
[48:03.11]They get it from... Okay, they got it from the statue.
[48:04.51]I was going to say, what?
[48:07.73]Come on, man.
[48:10.45]Thankfully, two of them are still asleep.
[48:15.58]Juice box, right?
[48:16.36]Yeah.
[48:26.65]Cool.
[48:26.95]Alright, there's sleep.
[48:35.48]Now that I have mightiness up, let's do this.
[48:41.48]That's going to be huge.
[48:44.34]54 damage.
[48:44.62]Alright, now get out of here.
[48:47.42]Oh, that one was asleep.
[48:48.26]I'm an idiot.
[48:48.90]It's alright.
[48:49.22]I'll get it.
[48:49.50]I'll figure it out.
[49:00.11]I don't think I need to eat anything.
[49:01.12]I think I'm good.
[49:07.82]Backgrounds are really trippy.
[49:09.00]They're really crazy.
[49:12.80]Alright.
[49:16.53]I think I want to go buy stuff.
[49:19.17]Is there anywhere I can go from here?
[49:20.23]Or is it just... That's it.
[49:29.50]I think that's it.
[49:38.39]I did the paper cup here.
[49:39.67]Already got it.
[49:45.87]Yeah, I have a lot of money.
[49:46.83]I'm gonna go buy stuff.
[49:54.12]I want to watch this, but the visuals are giving me a headache.
[49:57.64]Should there be something in the title that just says, like, you know, hey, like, visuals are, like, kind of trippy or something?
[50:04.45]Probably not a bad idea.
[50:11.79]I guess it's not too, too bad, right?
[50:14.67]Not enough for, like, a warning.
[50:15.47]I don't know.
[50:17.44]What do you guys think?
[50:17.94]Hmm.
[50:31.58]Maybe like an eye strain warning.
[50:35.45]It's fine.
[50:36.05]It's fine.
[50:36.37]It's fine.
[50:40.33]It doesn't seem dangerous.
[50:41.69]No, I don't think so.
[50:45.69]Eye strain.
[50:47.02]Warning.
[50:47.70]Eye strain incoming.
[50:50.74]This actually is fine for me.
[50:51.88]I'm very sensitive to stuff like this and I've been okay.
[51:10.63]Oops.
[51:10.95]I didn't mean to do.
[51:13.29]What did I just do?
[51:14.23]Skip.
[51:17.43]Warning, don't watch.
[51:24.44]Stop missing.
[51:25.06]Oh my God, we're going to die.
[51:28.18]Finally.
[51:28.80]Oh my God.
[51:33.84]Are we this?
[51:36.54]Oh, we're blind.
[51:39.60]Okay, well... Don't I have something to remove the status effects, right?
[51:58.90]The veggies do?
[52:05.28]Cool.
[52:08.41]I have a lot of money.
[52:11.31]We gotta go.
[52:25.65]I have like a couple, at least two or three thousand bucks, don't I?
[52:41.34]Alright, what do you sell?
[52:50.72]Okay, turbo tendons.
[52:54.73]Allows wearer to wield two weapons.
[52:58.29]20% of wearer's normal attacks inflict poison.
[53:00.63]Okay, so should somebody have poison?
[53:02.99]Or is this too expensive for right now?
[53:16.48]Get cellophane.
[53:18.60]How many?
[53:20.66]Two?
[53:20.94]Three?
[53:21.56]I don't want to spend that much.
[53:22.46]Alright, I'll get two.
[53:23.02]I'm going to get this.
[53:29.54]I want someone to have that.
[53:41.08]So this prevents blind.
[53:44.73]And then this is poison.
[53:47.73]Poison damage, and then it prevents blind set.
[53:50.27]That's actually huge right now.
[53:51.65]Alright.
[53:53.51]Nice.
[54:08.29]Anything else for me to purchase?
[54:10.18]There's another strap too, isn't there?
[54:11.42]Yeah.
[54:12.46]What do you got?
[54:17.74]Combat bell?
[54:21.50]Giant metal dome apparel, too large to be worn with any other armor.
[54:27.46]What does it do?
[54:34.64]Plus 50, plus 50 what?
[54:36.69]Armor?
[54:42.51]I mean, that's pretty good.
[54:44.67]But I can't wear this with anything else.
[54:48.27]So I wouldn't be able to have this and the sunglasses on.
[54:53.07]I'll get it.
[54:53.45]Yeah, okay.
[55:01.70]Is that worth it?
[55:09.73]what is it what stats is it increasing 30 30 everything looks the same it's just an armor rating
[55:36.22]Well, might as well give that to you.
[55:44.92]It's flesh slash health.
[55:47.15]Oh, okay.
[55:49.71]Okay, look at 140 health.
[55:51.19]Holy smokes.
[55:52.95]That's a lot.
[55:57.97]My tortoise is watching this stream.
[55:59.64]She hates you, but I think she likes the game.
[56:03.20]What are you on about?
[56:08.46]Okay, I think that's good.
[56:15.56]Where do I buy vegetables?
[56:16.58]I feel like I'm running out.
[56:25.29]There's another store here, right?
[56:32.61]Or can you only get them from the garden?
[56:36.25]They grow infinitely.
[56:37.71]Oh, I was going to say that makes sense.
[56:43.05]Somebody said that song was scratching their frontal lobe.
[56:46.69]I feel like I may have missed a secret or two here.
[56:57.81]Hmm.
[57:07.67]Maybe I have.
[57:08.31]Trash can?
[57:11.93]I already got it, didn't I?
[57:21.60]Or is there another trash can?
[57:22.88]Oh, there is.
[57:23.36]Okay.
[57:28.27]47 bucks in here.
[57:29.03]Check the TV again.
[57:30.11]Okay.
[57:31.37]Something else?
[58:01.97]Um, I don't think so.
[58:05.83]Alright, now I'm pretty decked out now.
[58:08.73]I'm going to do that other stuff.
[58:10.55]I'm going to where I got in trouble last time.
[58:12.15]I think that's a good idea.
[58:15.58]And we're probably... I think I'm going to show some Grotto Beasts stuff.
[58:20.14]Talk about it for a little bit.
[58:21.34]I think I was going to wait like an hour.
[58:26.86]We've got to go over some questions and some answers.
[58:29.97]I want to show the box.
[58:32.84]I have it here.
[58:33.34]We can go over some stuff.
[58:38.20]Give me one second.
[58:38.90]I'm gonna... This can just stay right here.
[58:44.73]Yeah, we'll come right back to this.
[58:47.47]I just want to show... Actually, let me put that here.
[58:53.88]Alright.
[58:54.90]I want to go over...
[58:57.89]Since Grotto Beasts has gone into presale, I really want to go over some of the more... some amendments to that FAQ.
[59:07.44]And this whole thing is going to get pieced together, and any of this FAQ stuff that you guys have seen so far will be on the website.
[59:13.62]We just want to clean it up and make sure it's correct.
[59:15.96]But there's a lot of stuff to go over, because we have hit a very, very interesting milestone, and we'll talk about it.
[59:24.89]So let's start.
[59:25.33]We're going to start at the top.
[59:26.83]Here comes another presentation.
[59:29.99]Presentation incoming.
[59:32.07]It is only one slide this time, so don't worry.
[59:34.45]It's not like 10 slides.
[59:38.29]So, let's do that right now.
[59:44.70]Let me get it up.
[59:48.68]It's only one slide, yeah.
[59:50.99]There were just some other things we wanted to make sure people were aware of, and I'm just going to read this stuff pretty much line by line.
[59:56.37]PowerPoint.
[60:00.72]Okay, let me get it up here.
[60:02.40]Okay.
[60:06.68]Okay.
[60:09.79]Okay.
[60:12.05]Okay.
[60:13.53]Let's go over this because these are, this is going to answer some questions and go over some important store updates, dates, and limited items.
[60:23.54]Okay.
[60:25.58]So there's a lot of text on this screen.
[60:27.80]So just be aware.
[60:28.76]I want to get it on one slide.
[60:30.86]Here we go.
[60:33.05]Here are some clarifications and amendments to what we talked about two, three days ago.
[60:39.64]So, Grotto Beasts is in presale right now.
[60:43.53]It's available right now on grottobeasts.net.
[60:46.63]This is a very, yeah, there's a lot of text.
[60:48.49]I'm going to read it.
[60:51.07]So, we've had a lot of questions since this.
[60:54.27]And don't skip ahead.
[60:55.33]Don't skip.
[60:55.71]I know you're going to read ahead.
[60:56.65]Don't skip ahead.
[61:00.20]Wait for me to read.
[61:02.32]Oh, shit.
[61:03.06]Cartoon mischief.
[61:06.34]Alright.
[61:06.62]So, we've had a lot of questions about the holographics.
[61:09.26]Wait, you've got four different holographic types.
[61:11.39]Does that mean that each card could have a holographic in four different versions?
[61:14.93]No.
[61:15.93]There are four types of holographic film.
[61:19.25]And each card has a specific holographic film type assigned to it.
[61:25.06]So, for example, you should never find a Fretzel, right here, that has anything but a hollow dot pattern.
[61:35.49]So I think a lot of people were saying, whoa, that seems like a lot of potential holographics for if each one has the... No, no, no.
[61:42.82]They're all assigned.
[61:46.80]So we've had that question come in a lot.
[61:50.18]So we've also numbered our production so that every booster pack will have one rare card and exactly one holographic card in every booster pack.
[61:58.61]So what that means, the holo is one random card, which can be either rare or common, so some packs will potentially have two rares.
[62:07.26]We've got that question a lot too.
[62:11.04]Now, for some store updates.
[62:14.94]Let's go over some updates on the store.
[62:18.09]Uh... Do not read the second line yet.
[62:21.75]I know you already have, but it's fucking crazy.
[62:26.70]We are going to let everyone know when we have an exact date in mind for the pre-sale to end.
[62:33.13]The store may halt for a while in that period, and depending on inventory, we'll need to see what items will be available for when we leave pre-sale up.
[62:41.77]This will be at least 10 to 14 days from now.
[62:44.95]So we don't have a hard date for the end of the pre-sale, but it will be at least another two weeks.
[62:52.97]So if you are buying it right now, we're trying to keep the free sale up as long as we can.
[62:59.25]And the reason why we're doing that is because of the second line here.
[63:03.54]So the initial production of the boosters have all been claimed.
[63:10.70]So the boosters of our first production run here have been claimed.
[63:16.49]so we're already in contact with the printer to scale up the production and order more we want I want to touch again on this pre-sale strategy it's important we didn't want our inventory currently in production to sell out ship out and have a secondary market takeover for people that didn't get in on the pre-sale and wanted to claim items this pre-sale is going to continue normally but those of you buying booster packs now which is over our current inventory
[63:46.60]You're going to need to wait a little longer until the next order.
[63:50.52]We'll get some better dates for you in the near future, but we want to make sure we can make this really clear.
[63:54.54]That there's going to be a waiting period for boosters purchased as of this period now.
[63:59.87]After the first shipments go out.
[64:02.31]This is very corporate.
[64:03.61]It has to be.
[64:04.45]Because I want to make sure I get this correct.
[64:07.24]So, that being said, the available... This is not corporate anymore.
[64:16.93]The availability of the two-player starter kits, as of... I just heard Holly laugh.
[64:23.53]As of this stream right now, are not affected by the new production order.
[64:27.85]So people are still claiming through the stock.
[64:30.38]And each kit has two boosters in it.
[64:33.04]So right now, we've not gone through all of the starter kits.
[64:36.76]So those, you're still fine during the pre-sale.
[64:39.66]Buying them now, if you do.
[64:41.96]Those, as well as the first run of boosters, are planning to ship out after the pre-sale ends.
[64:46.70]So, the starter kits are still available.
[64:49.13]And it's not that boosters are not available.
[64:51.65]It's just the second order of boosters is gonna... You'll get it later.
[64:58.04]It's gonna be a... I don't want to give you a date because we don't really know.
[65:01.34]But it shouldn't be that long, but it will be a little longer.
[65:06.96]So, we want to make sure people know this.
[65:09.85]Also, important...
[65:12.84]Some of the apparel and prints are only available for a limited time until March 31st.
[65:21.46]So the 40, the original 40 Beast shirts, the art prints, the Grotto Beasts logo hat and beanies, and the glow-in-the-dark version of that ghost hoodie and tee are all leaving the store on the 31st.
[65:41.25]That's the plan.
[65:44.36]Now I want to talk to you about this.
[65:46.58]Get off my screen.
[65:48.09]Get off my screen.
[65:51.33]So the age rating on the box, I want to make this really clear.
[65:56.21]So it's listed as six plus as more of a guideline for the physical product.
[66:00.61]There are dice in here.
[66:02.95]We wanted people to make sure that there are small pieces in here.
[66:07.11]Because if you bought this and there was no minimum sort of age rating on it, there are small physical pieces in here.
[66:14.63]And we just want to make sure people know that.
[66:19.01]Also, very important, this is a mature audience channel.
[66:24.97]And although there are no pieces of explicit language or imagery, there are still references to tobacco, cartoon violence, cartoon mischief.
[66:33.49]It's stream references.
[66:36.99]So if you're, like, think about that, right?
[66:39.74]There are references to characters here that might not be appropriate for little kids.
[66:46.33]But we try to make this project be as general audience as possible.
[66:52.07]But also keep in mind that this is channel merch for this community, first and foremost.
[66:57.58]This is merch for you guys.
[67:00.13]Merch for the community.
[67:01.23]That's all this project ever was intended to be.
[67:04.11]So just be aware that there are references to mature audience streams, even though we tried to make this as general audience as we could.
[67:12.24]You understand?
[67:16.24]Do you feel me?
[67:17.84]Outrage!
[67:18.54]Tobacco!
[67:20.97]But, you know, we want to make this clear for people.
[67:23.92]There are definitely going to be people that stumble upon this project and just potentially have no idea who the fuck I am.
[67:31.01]We just want people to know this.
[67:34.69]I do not understand.
[67:40.09]So, with all this being said, are we clear on this stuff?
[67:44.89]Are we clear on these?
[67:45.65]Is everybody clear?
[67:54.07]Can you please put this into simpler terms?
[67:57.77]Um, no, I can't.
[67:59.48]That'll get me in trouble.
[68:04.80]No, I cannot, because I want to make sure we're very clear on what's happening.
[68:09.88]I'll look over at the Grotto Beasts group chat, and they'll be in all capitals.
[68:14.14]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[68:18.14]Can you explain this in Family Guy terms?
[68:20.62]No, I don't think I can.
[68:21.34]I don't think I can.
[68:23.33]So, it's time I want to show you some things.
[68:29.60]He makes us sound so angry.
[68:31.20]No, I'm kidding.
[68:32.54]They're a wonderful group over there, I promise.
[68:34.74]I'm just kidding around.
[68:39.00]I have some things here that I would like to show.
[68:42.07]You guys ready?
[68:46.13]Are you ready for me to reveal it?
[68:48.69]Stop bumping the mic.
[68:49.65]I'm not trying to.
[68:52.51]I'm going to show you multiple things because it's kind of interesting how this plays out.
[68:57.77]Get my drink.
[69:00.57]Okay.
[69:03.15]Let's go like this.
[69:08.67]Let's go like this.
[69:11.79]And then let's go like this.
[69:14.67]Uh-oh, they can see me.
[69:22.93]Hold on.
[69:25.41]Hold on.
[69:27.43]Hi.
[69:29.09]How are you?
[69:29.73]Where are you?
[69:30.39]Where the heck are you?
[69:32.11]No, you're up there.
[69:32.97]Good to see you again.
[69:33.67]Uh, we're gonna go over the box.
[69:36.93]You got a full beard.
[69:37.79]It's, hey, it's been kind of a wild couple of weeks.
[69:42.22]I'm not, I haven't shaved or anything.
[69:43.94]I haven't had a haircut.
[69:45.08]We just, I'm sorry.
[69:46.10]That's just the way it is.
[69:47.82]Is it really delayed?
[69:48.80]It shouldn't be.
[69:51.04]Oh, maybe the last time I used my facecam was
[69:56.45]Let me see.
[70:03.86]No, that should be fine.
[70:07.18]It shouldn't be.
[70:07.64]That's not delayed.
[70:08.18]What are you talking about?
[70:09.06]It's fine.
[70:09.44]What do you mean?
[70:11.06]Alright.
[70:11.40]You ready?
[70:13.98]You're ugly.
[70:17.34]I want to show you.
[70:19.62]No, don't look yet.
[70:20.54]I want to show you the first iteration of the box.
[70:25.79]I'm going to get to see behind the curtain here.
[70:28.08]So this is what the box looked like originally.
[70:32.02]Let me make sure I got that right.
[70:35.24]Yeah.
[70:36.20]So here it is.
[70:37.66]So this is the original Grotto Beasts box.
[70:41.60]Looks pretty cool, right?
[70:43.02]This is the first iteration.
[70:45.18]And I want to show you.
[70:45.96]It's alright.
[70:47.98]It's kind of sturdy, but not that sturdy.
[70:52.92]And as you can see...
[70:56.42]It's not, we didn't, we weren't really happy with this.
[71:00.48]We wanted there to be something interesting in here.
[71:03.94]This is where the dice were going to go, in here.
[71:07.47]In this little thing.
[71:08.63]But it turned out to be kind of annoying.
[71:12.05]It turned out, it could get kind of squished.
[71:14.73]So we decided, nah, maybe let's do another version.
[71:17.91]Another iteration.
[71:19.41]It just doesn't, it really just didn't do it for us.
[71:22.95]And obviously, if I'm going to charge 79 fucking dollars for something, like, I want to make it at least fucking some, you know, make it, make it quality if I can, right?
[71:32.92]Because I didn't, we didn't want to sell this for 80 bucks.
[71:35.04]No fucking way.
[71:35.70]That was not going to happen.
[71:37.18]So, but we thought, okay, what can we do?
[71:41.06]Then, we came to this one.
[71:47.13]Now this one, you can even hear it.
[71:50.93]The material is a lot sturdier.
[71:54.44]This is, this is the box.
[71:55.98]This is the real box.
[71:57.92]So in here, I want to, maybe I can show you the difference between like this.
[72:04.37]Here they are on top of each other.
[72:06.11]Like you might not be able to see the difference, but you can definitely feel it.
[72:08.87]This is a little, I want to say flimsier.
[72:11.97]This one is hard.
[72:13.22]It's sturdier.
[72:15.15]So then, yeah, take a look.
[72:17.02]There it is.
[72:17.96]Now you're probably saying, dude, this stuff, where's all the stuff?
[72:22.68]This is a print.
[72:24.00]This is a sample.
[72:25.60]So if you take a look down there.
[72:26.48]Ooh, cool.
[72:29.64]This is what sits in the middle, which is now holding the dice.
[72:33.88]And I kind of fucked it up a little bit.
[72:35.48]So this is my own fault.
[72:37.04]This is what it sits in now.
[72:38.86]You get this little like boat.
[72:40.90]And see there, you see like the glowing.
[72:43.62]It's like sits on top of this.
[72:46.19]this.
[72:47.37]So it sits in the box like this.
[72:48.49]I fucked mine up because I was fucking with it too much.
[72:51.91]But you get a dice boat that sits like this.
[72:56.56]And then there's two starter decks right here.
[73:00.54]It's pretty nice.
[73:01.22]And it's a lot nicer than this.
[73:02.96]And like I said, we weren't going to sell this for $80.
[73:04.24]That would be fucking... No way.
[73:06.90]Not going to happen.
[73:08.82]So here are the dice.
[73:09.56]I don't know if I can even show these that well.
[73:15.14]But here they are.
[73:17.68]These dice, they have... Can you see?
[73:23.66]There's the print.
[73:24.82]The light's not great in here.
[73:26.50]But there's the J. The Jerma J. These are fun.
[73:34.38]For all your dice needs.
[73:38.12]Yeah, you can't see it.
[73:38.96]It doesn't come out that well on camera here.
[73:42.50]But they're themed dice.
[73:47.98]Pretty cool.
[73:48.86]So those sit in here.
[73:53.32]Like that.
[73:55.38]And these come in a little bag.
[74:00.59]They will come in a little bag so they don't jump around too much.
[74:04.67]And then... Aha!
[74:09.42]Here's the manual.
[74:11.26]The manual is right here.
[74:12.44]I don't want to... Should I open this?
[74:18.62]It's really nice.
[74:19.26]It's nice.
[74:27.82]It's kind of like, acts as like a little art book, too, in a way.
[74:31.09]It's not an art book, but, you know, there's a lot of nice stuff in here.
[74:39.15]Take a look.
[74:39.51]There you go.
[74:40.73]But this is not an art book.
[74:41.93]Let me make that really clear.
[74:43.55]Not an art book.
[74:46.97]It's the manual, the rules for the game.
[74:49.21]But there is, like, some nice stuff here.
[74:53.95]Then... Here, there are two play mats.
[75:01.30]Let's do it.
[75:03.82]Here is one of the play mats.
[75:07.92]And this is just standard paper.
[75:09.66]This is not, like, felt or something.
[75:12.23]But here's the play mat.
[75:13.11]Here's one of them.
[75:13.55]They're pretty big.
[75:18.33]And then here's the other one.
[75:22.25]They're not like felt.
[75:29.05]Here you go.
[75:30.19]Here's the, here's the other one.
[75:33.55]Pretty cool.
[75:35.23]Pretty cool stuff.
[75:38.59]And then that's also in that box.
[75:42.59]And then we get to these.
[75:45.45]These are my favorite.
[75:46.41]This is my favorite part.
[75:49.67]These.
[75:51.35]So, I can't open these.
[75:52.77]There's nothing in here.
[75:54.75]I just want to get you to see what it looks like in somebody's hand.
[75:58.17]They feel nice.
[76:00.30]The foils are cool.
[76:01.30]Take a look at the back.
[76:02.76]Can you get a good view?
[76:06.02]Take a look at that.
[76:10.18]There it is.
[76:12.75]These are your packs.
[76:13.85]Two of these come in the box.
[76:16.25]They come in the box.
[76:18.67]And why don't we?
[76:19.97]No, that's my favorite part, for sure.
[76:26.49]Oh, also, very important to mention.
[76:29.14]All the cards, this is all printed and made in America.
[76:31.54]The only difference is the dice were not, the dice were made in China.
[76:34.52]So, everything, this whole thing was made and printed in the United States.
[76:38.88]So, that's, that's cool.
[76:42.71]Here you go.
[76:43.55]Card reveal!
[76:44.15]Here's one.
[76:50.52]Pretty shiny.
[76:52.22]Feels pretty good.
[76:53.92]Give you kind of a look of what they look like in somebody's hand.
[76:57.71]If I get it really close, I wonder if I can get it close for you.
[77:11.43]And again, these are standard playing card sizes.
[77:13.77]Okay.
[77:22.47]Haven't even fucking seen this one yet.
[77:24.85]You haven't even seen this one yet!
[77:26.41]Card reveal!
[77:31.34]The lighting in the room is not great, but... So this is a rare.
[77:34.18]I don't have any holographics to show because they're being made.
[77:36.84]So I can't really show them.
[77:39.38]But this is what one looks like.
[77:43.62]You want to see the back?
[77:45.00]What it looks like on the back.
[77:47.76]If you want to hear... You want a sound test?
[77:51.83]Sound test.
[77:53.27]Flip test.
[77:55.11]Throw test.
[77:58.75]I'm gonna move it around.
[78:04.22]Pretty sturdy.
[78:05.44]Pretty solid.
[78:08.82]There you go.
[78:10.34]You want me to fan it out?
[78:12.13]Taste test?
[78:13.13]No.
[78:19.91]Oh, wait, let me show this.
[78:21.93]This is glue, man.
[78:25.49]I wish the camera wasn't so bad.
[78:27.49]Because this, they, actually, the printing came out really nicely.
[78:31.53]For, yeah, it's full art, yeah.
[78:34.83]The rares, uh, I've learned the rares.
[78:36.44]The challenger cards, I believe, are full, right?
[78:39.84]Let me make sure somebody corrects me.
[78:43.02]Can you see it well?
[78:48.80]There you go.
[78:49.98]Throw it at the wall.
[78:53.93]No, this is my Glue Man.
[78:55.01]I'm not doing that.
[78:55.55]Are you crazy?
[78:58.73]Yeah, I just, we wanted to show people what, because I, look, I get it.
[79:03.32]It's 80 fucking dollars.
[79:05.10]It's 10 bucks per pack.
[79:06.28]I want you to be able to understand what you're getting.
[79:10.90]So, let's fan it out.
[79:12.76]Sorry, I'm looking over here.
[79:13.54]I have to look at the preview to make sure I'm showing it right.
[79:19.47]There you go.
[79:20.85]That's what you can expect.
[79:26.53]Yep.
[79:27.55]Printed and made in America.
[79:28.89]Except for the dice.
[79:31.97]It's been, it's been quite a journey.
[79:37.03]There you go.
[79:39.81]What happens if you rip the mats?
[79:42.46]I would just be careful with them.
[79:43.68]Be careful with them.
[79:45.24]Oh, also, yeah, very, very important to remember as well.
[79:49.27]That, there are two full decks that are coming with this box.
[79:53.25]I just, I don't have them here right now.
[79:56.56]They're not, we, I did, we had printing stuff, and they're making them, they're producing them, but we, these are just samples of the boxes and some of the cards.
[80:05.20]So, there are two full decks that will be sitting in these little wells, and then everything will sit on top.
[80:12.06]Actually, I'll show you what it might look like when you open it.
[80:18.01]Probably a good idea.
[80:22.86]Fold everything back up.
[80:28.48]There are duplicates.
[80:29.62]Yes, there are.
[80:31.40]The game... So, besides this being channel merch, because that's what this is, we wanted a good functioning game on top of it, because why not?
[80:41.09]Originally, this was going to be baseball cards.
[80:44.27]In quotes.
[80:46.14]So, this was originally just going to be no game.
[80:49.71]We got in touch with the game designer, and it was like, why not?
[80:51.61]Let's go.
[80:52.89]Why not just have something fun on top of it, too?
[80:55.43]So, there are... You can have duplicates in a deck, and it's... The game-wise, it makes sense.
[81:02.78]Because I think you can have up to three cards, right?
[81:05.72]Up to three of the same card.
[81:08.34]Gotta fold this up nice.
[81:09.48]I don't want to mess it up.
[81:13.62]So in the starter deck, there are duplicates.
[81:17.12]Because they are pre-built decks for you to just be able to play it or just collect it.
[81:23.27]So the decks in there are pre-built.
[81:31.23]I gotta fold this.
[81:32.45]I'm so paranoid I'm gonna rip it.
[81:34.16]Because I don't want to... This is my special sample copy.
[81:38.62]I don't want to mess it up.
[81:41.08]They're pretty sturdy, though.
[81:43.02]As it feels like it.
[81:43.66]There we go.
[81:48.19]What do they smell like?
[81:52.95]Oh, nothing.
[81:54.17]Uh, that moon, by the way... That moon card comes in the starter kit.
[81:58.97]So that's good to know.
[82:00.33]If you want that card, it's in the starter kit.
[82:02.83]My card, the Jerma card, is also in the starter kit as well.
[82:08.93]Would you like to see how far we've come?
[82:14.22]this is from the stream do you remember this yeah these are these are from the these are from the stream you remember the stream these are not I would say these are not that you know they're a little the cut is a little we did this happened by yeah archaella don't bend it I'm not I just want to show you the difference I want to show you the difference
[82:45.76]I'm not bending them that hard.
[82:48.73]Yeah, two different pre-built decks.
[82:50.95]Two different decks.
[82:51.65]You don't get two of the same one.
[82:52.57]It's two different pre-built decks.
[82:57.87]There you go.
[82:59.35]You want to see the difference?
[83:03.09]Might as well show the difference, right?
[83:08.05]So the one on the left is the original, the one on the right is the new.
[83:12.39]The new one.
[83:13.13]The new card.
[83:14.21]I guess you could say the new, what it looks like.
[83:15.79]Actually, I had a better idea to show it like this.
[83:22.29]Did I get a good idea of what, like, the first original on the stream looked like?
[83:26.27]There we go.
[83:26.89]There.
[83:31.50]Yep.
[83:35.95]So this one on the left is the ones we're printing.
[83:39.01]The one on the right is the original.
[83:41.88]And again, printed and made in America.
[83:43.50]I want to make that point clear.
[83:48.26]In the United States of America.
[83:52.17]Oh!
[83:52.43]I dropped them!
[83:58.61]My precious samples!
[84:04.33]So between the two starter decks that you get, there are, I believe there are 40 unique cards.
[84:11.03]Because they're doubles.
[84:12.19]We have to have doubles for the game sense, right?
[84:14.52]There's 84 cards total in each, across the two starter decks.
[84:20.26]So there you go.
[84:22.96]I fucked that up.
[84:25.46]More than 40 unique cards, sorry.
[84:28.26]I gotta get corrected by the Grotto Beasts group chat.
[84:31.90]And then you get the two boosters in there, too, which is another 20 cards.
[84:34.90]There you go.
[84:38.68]Pick them up.
[84:39.64]They've fallen into perfect position.
[84:44.95]Pinned tweet.
[84:45.85]Pinned tweet.
[84:51.25]Thank you for the demonstration, Mr. Jeremy.
[84:53.37]Will this be on the test?
[84:54.39]Okay.
[85:00.00]If it's more than a four, it's on the test.
[85:07.52]Six.
[85:09.60]Are Grotto Beasts NFTs?
[85:10.84]No!
[85:11.48]Stop saying that!
[85:14.91]Look!
[85:23.65]I like this.
[85:24.83]It's cool.
[85:26.43]Alright, there you go.
[85:27.33]I want to show it.
[85:27.97]Now you see kind of what's in the box.
[85:29.37]Unfortunately, the two pre-built starter decks are not there.
[85:33.86]As well as any of the cards that, obviously, because we don't have that, I don't have them here.
[85:37.28]There you go.
[85:40.89]Are there any questions before we move on?
[85:43.45]I want to make sure we answer most of the stuff right now.
[85:54.90]Why did I, how am I going to answer any of these?
[85:59.56]When are they shipping?
[86:01.06]Alright, Grotto Beasts group chat, give me a hand here because we're having a pre-sale go for the next probably two weeks.
[86:08.21]After the pre-sale ends, the inventory that we've already have in production right now will be part of the first things to ship out.
[86:15.87]Again, if you are buying boosters right now, you are claiming the second run of production.
[86:24.20]Because the first run of production has already been claimed.
[86:32.37]How many total unique cards are there?
[86:34.75]200.
[86:34.83]There are 200 unique cards.
[86:47.92]Is it feasibly possible to collect everything?
[86:51.46]That is a good question.
[86:53.80]I think the purpose with this was to be interesting merch.
[86:58.50]And we don't really have a plan as of right now and what we're going to do in the future with this.
[87:03.76]So, I don't know.
[87:05.44]I guess maybe?
[87:06.54]It's a great question.
[87:07.76]Because it's a limited run as well.
[87:14.66]What's the calorie count?
[87:19.64]Yes, the presale is going to ship out shortly after the presale ends.
[87:23.12]So in a couple of weeks, just check back every so often.
[87:26.75]Guys, I'm going to be talking about this every five or six days until every like, but that's way too long.
[87:33.35]I'll be talking about this every day or two.
[87:35.75]on stream until the pre-sale is over.
[87:38.75]Again, the point of the pre-sale is even though we've gone through our production inventory of boosters, I didn't want it to say, well, it's sold out.
[87:50.48]And that's it.
[87:51.72]And sorry, but we went through our inventory and that's it.
[87:54.44]We have to contact the printer, reprint, do a second run, but keep the presale open so you can still claim it at the price we are showing you.
[88:04.72]If we didn't, if it was just that one run and we didn't kind of keep this presale going, then two or three weeks from now, I don't want these to appear for, you know, the price that we, a price that we are not telling you to pay weeks down the road.
[88:19.58]We want whoever wants this over the coming two or three weeks to be able to claim product for the price that we are telling you.
[88:30.67]So over these two and a half weeks or so, we're keeping a pre-sale going, regardless if we run out of production inventory.
[88:41.80]How long is a pre-sale?
[88:42.64]At least 10 to 14 more days.
[88:43.42]At least.
[88:43.64]So there you go.
[88:56.12]Will you play it on stream?
[88:57.44]You will absolutely see this be shown on stream.
[89:01.50]I can't say I'm very good.
[89:02.82]It's fun, though.
[89:05.20]It's very fun.
[89:14.84]And then in another couple weeks, we'll have maybe something else to talk about and show you, but from now, we're really happy.
[89:24.68]It seems like people are into it, and that was a big fear, is are people, and all the production costs and everything, is this, like, people gonna actually care about this?
[89:34.27]And the answer apparently is yes.
[89:36.49]So...
[89:38.46]Thanks, everybody.
[89:39.90]We're all... You cannot understand the excitement going on over here.
[89:43.70]Everyone that's just so happy with the reception.
[89:47.00]And we hope you like it.
[89:47.86]We hope you think it's a good enough quality.
[89:49.68]We really hope you do.
[89:51.37]And... It's... It's merch.
[89:57.83]It's channel merch.
[89:59.17]And that's pretty much the way that it is.
[90:04.51]It's very different channel merch, but it is merch nonetheless.
[90:14.57]And any plans on this project going forward, we don't have... There's no plans right now.
[90:20.38]We don't want to talk about any plans because we need to see how this goes.
[90:26.38]This is uncharted territory for everybody over here.
[90:28.93]So... We're trying.
[90:31.33]We're trying to figure it out.
[90:40.12]This guy sucks at Grotto Beasts.
[90:46.91]What happened to the pinned tweet?
[90:48.51]I deleted it because I need to make room for another one.
[90:59.52]I hope it makes it big.
[91:02.29]Well, and again, that's fucking cool.
[91:05.73]That's really, really cool.
[91:07.27]I can't even believe that that's something that somebody would even utter.
[91:10.78]But remember, it's fun channel merch, first and foremost.
[91:16.24]We made this for you guys.
[91:17.68]We made this for this community.
[91:19.93]That was the intent.
[91:20.77]That was the purpose.
[91:22.51]And whatever people do with it, whatever people think, how much fun people have with it, cool, that's awesome.
[91:26.83]That makes all of us happy.
[91:32.25]And we'll see.
[91:36.36]Let's go back to Hilux.
[91:42.07]Although, I gotta pee.
[91:43.89]I'll be right back.
[91:45.68]I'm gonna go pee.
[97:20.30]okay I am back sorry I was gone for a little bit I wanted to refill my little drink I have here I also wanted to just kind of corroborate with the Grotto Beasts team make sure everything I said was accurate cool oh there's no music I'm sorry should have been this
[97:46.02]Well, I did pee.
[97:47.66]I peed.
[97:48.76]And then I was like, hey, let's ask a couple of questions to make sure I got this right.
[98:00.42]Okie dokie.
[98:04.84]Let's play Ilex.
[98:10.22]What's the last time we just did?
[98:15.28]Right.
[98:15.64]I came here.
[98:16.10]I did this.
[98:16.82]I'm going to go to that place where I was before down here.
[98:19.92]Oh, I don't need to go in this.
[98:34.37]Don't you dare tell me that I need to relax.
[98:37.07]Well, I'm saying what I am relaxing right now.
[98:39.85]OK.
[98:47.39]I think I can fight these things now, can't I?
[98:48.83]I should be strong enough.
[98:53.44]I'm doing it.
[98:58.48]Oh shit, I forgot to sleep.
[99:04.06]Oops.
[99:07.62]Vibe check?
[99:08.24]I think the vibes are pretty great.
[99:15.70]Oh, I need to heal.
[99:21.99]Ooh, that hurt.
[99:31.16]Two damage.
[99:38.50]Don't do it.
[99:39.54]No!
[99:48.57]I think I'm alright.
[99:54.20]Jesus, this hurts.
[100:05.02]Oh, I could revive, but no, I only have one of those.
[100:07.92]Shit.
[100:19.17]Kind of in trouble.
[100:36.67]I think I'll survive.
[100:40.61]Yeah, I'm alright.
[100:52.55]These things hurt.
[100:56.78]The sauce still says you're in the bathroom.
[101:00.46]Well, the stream is live right now.
[101:02.62]That's for only when the stream is offline.
[101:14.08]600 bucks.
[101:15.00]Damn.
[101:17.49]Okay, hold on.
[101:22.89]This is... We need to heal.
[101:24.75]Wait.
[101:26.13]Wayne's just dead?
[101:31.08]oh I have to use the burrito okay alright what the fuck are you guys doing over here
[102:05.79]I'm not going to show that because it's stupid.
[102:10.05]Why?
[102:15.42]No, I'm not even going to address it.
[102:18.14]It's a stupid meme that somebody did in the Discord.
[102:32.61]I'm playing a game right now.
[102:33.79]I can't show it.
[102:34.42]TV.
[102:47.85]I don't even understand what this meme is.
[102:50.55]What is this meme trying to... What is this meme?
[102:54.29]Can somebody explain this to me?
[102:55.45]I don't get it.
[102:55.95]I mean, I get it what they're doing, but I don't get it at the same time.
[103:01.53]It's Bernie watching a video of me with cigarette packs smoking a cigarette.
[103:06.93]I don't get it.
[103:07.61]I don't understand this and I'm not showing it.
[103:09.29]I'm just not going to show it.
[103:11.88]I don't get it.
[103:21.76]I don't get... What does this mean?
[103:23.34]Fine, I'll show it.
[103:33.85]What is this supposed to be?
[103:34.85]I don't get it.
[103:54.60]I don't understand this.
[104:14.47]Does anybody get it?
[104:15.17]Alright, I don't want to die.
[104:32.87]I don't want to lose here.
[104:33.73]I gotta pay attention.
[104:35.71]I activated that crystal, right?
[104:36.65]Yeah.
[104:41.15]Just fight.
[104:43.72]I don't think there's anything to get necessarily.
[104:46.70]I don't get it.
[104:47.74]I don't get it.
[104:48.24]I don't get this.
[104:49.10]I don't get this.
[104:56.10]We're going to kill one real quick right now.
[105:05.14]Nice.
[105:07.22]You're not going to die again, right?
[105:15.69]You're gonna die again?
[105:17.16]What?
[105:23.44]He was at full health.
[105:25.00]Why'd he die so quickly?
[105:26.00]Bro, you suck.
[105:32.90]No, I gotta pay attention.
[105:34.42]People are sending me Bernie Sanders, like, smoking memes of me holding cigarette packs.
[105:39.78]I'm a little distracted right now.
[105:51.65]No, it's fine.
[106:01.82]I am kind of in trouble though.
[106:05.82]I think I have to die because then I can turn the meat in, right?
[106:10.08]Maybe that's not a bad thing.
[106:11.08]Parasite crystal?
[106:15.84]Parasite crystal?
[106:21.45]Whoa.
[106:24.33]I'm the sage of computers.
[106:25.67]I grant you my token.
[106:27.97]Sage's token.
[106:28.81]Okay, there's one more token.
[106:35.75]What about this?
[106:39.44]Cool.
[106:44.64]Okay, so I have this token.
[106:49.06]I am terrified of this thing.
[107:00.33]I don't have a revive.
[107:13.52]Check the right side and then I'll probably leave.
[107:21.28]That's the only way.
[107:30.56]I don't want to fight this thing.
[107:31.48]Oh shit.
[107:34.06]What?
[107:35.84]No, I thought I dodged it.
[107:37.14]Alright, I'll be alright.
[107:51.23]Just die, it's fine.
[107:52.97]But I want to be able to get all the secrets.
[108:03.85]Jerma I'm crunk right now I think you're cool I appreciate it thanks stunned can't do anything
[108:30.97]No!
[108:31.44]I thought it was gonna be dead.
[108:49.04]Are you skrunk?
[108:50.84]No.
[108:58.70]They explained the Bernie meme in the Discord.
[109:01.22]Oh, okay.
[109:06.92]When's the last time you played with Play-Doh?
[109:09.18]That would have to be at least 25 years ago.
[109:15.65]Dynamite.
[109:25.25]Wait, this is safe!
[109:27.80]No!
[109:28.08]You lied to me!
[109:29.60]You lied to me!
[109:31.40]I'm actually- I feel betrayed right now.
[109:32.96]You lied to me!
[109:34.48]You said red line, and that was a- You lied to me.
[109:40.04]Oh... I'm definitely dead.
[109:47.57]Oh, shit.
[109:48.29]Oh, no way.
[109:49.09]Goodbye.
[109:56.84]I do have a ton of meat, though.
[109:57.70]Alright, I got to come back here.
[110:13.95]22 meat, your max flesh rose, but OK, 44 extra health is huge.
[110:33.21]This is so cool and freaky.
[110:37.62]It is cool.
[110:40.72]It is cool and freaky.
[110:43.84]The executive balcony is down the stairs.
[110:45.94]Only those who have died three times are allowed there.
[110:49.94]I guess you qualify.
[110:51.18]Good job.
[110:51.96]You may proceed.
[110:55.32]Nice job.
[110:58.74]Huh?
[111:01.06]Swish, swish.
[111:05.51]Axe found?
[111:06.91]Ooh.
[111:07.23]Time steals away like a stream.
[111:10.83]We glide hence away.
[111:11.91]I need a paper cup.
[111:16.95]That's extra mana.
[111:22.49]Who can use that?
[111:29.44]Okay, so this is a ton of damage, but no... Nothing on it.
[111:34.87]Greatly increases maximum will points.
[111:37.51]Oh.
[111:40.19]I don't think I want that right now, but I definitely will take this.
[111:42.89]Uh...
[111:57.59]Maybe I should.
[112:03.16]Be like castor in a way.
[112:05.42]How much more?
[112:05.88]That's a lot.
[112:06.60]That's an unbelievable amount.
[112:11.00]Yeah, I think I'll keep it on.
[112:20.65]Well, I get a paper cup.
[112:21.79]I gotta remember where that is, but let me sleep on the couch.
[112:36.17]There we go.
[112:37.01]Alright, so it was... What color was the one where it just was?
[112:41.75]Red?
[112:41.99]Or was it green?
[112:42.71]I don't remember.
[112:45.03]What was it?
[112:45.69]It was green, right?
[112:48.37]Yeah.
[112:59.03]Alright, much stronger now.
[113:00.05]I think we have to fight this.
[113:06.56]I think I'm gonna do Panorama.
[113:21.65]45 damage, that's a lot.
[113:28.34]Hit all of them, that's good.
[113:29.16]Yeah, I'm gonna use, uh, Stay Dust as a caster.
[113:47.16]Healer.
[113:48.38]There's the poison.
[113:59.30]Think that the one in the middle will die?
[114:00.62]From poison, right?
[114:02.44]Get that counterattack out of here.
[114:09.03]Alright.
[114:10.95]This game's freaking me out, dude.
[114:19.97]Well, take a quick break.
[114:22.08]Another paper cup.
[114:23.80]Take a quick break and come back.
[114:27.38]Or not.
[114:27.94]You know, maybe get some food in you, too.
[114:36.08]Muscle?
[114:37.02]Alright.
[114:38.02]I'm afraid, but I'm gonna do it.
[114:41.54]You inadvertently destroyed it.
[114:42.98]What?
[114:46.05]What just happened?
[114:46.61]Those things kill you instantly.
[114:53.91]What?
[114:58.94]Holy shit.
[114:59.60]Okay, well.
[115:09.77]Try it again.
[115:11.89]Did I get everything that was down there?
[115:13.08]Let me check.
[115:25.74]You ignored the sign at the beginning.
[115:28.25]Oh, those are the skulls.
[115:30.23]Well, I didn't know what it meant by that.
[115:32.79]Everything in this game is so wacky looking.
[115:34.59]I don't know.
[115:35.69]I don't know.
[115:36.09]I don't know what that thing was.
[115:43.16]300 bucks.
[115:43.70]Nice.
[115:43.96]Alright.
[115:50.88]Well, I got everything here.
[115:52.85]I got everything here.
[115:53.55]Alright.
[116:07.76]So where have I not gone?
[116:11.55]I guess I could walk around out here?
[116:13.79]Have I explored all this area yet?
[116:27.94]No, there was that big, that like big vault.
[116:29.90]I wonder if I'm strong enough.
[116:30.66]Where should I go?
[116:39.98]Orange?
[116:44.43]Orange or blue?
[116:47.93]Blue, I think, right?
[116:49.95]I'm pretty sure it's blue.
[117:01.42]And then from blue... Was he up or was he... I don't remember where he was.
[117:06.84]Where was that guy?
[117:13.80]The vegetables.
[117:15.12]Oh, yes.
[117:15.54]Vegetables.
[117:15.98]Vegetables.
[117:16.38]Vegetables.
[117:21.24]Part 2 is even better.
[117:22.24]I mean, this is great.
[117:56.17]Alright.
[117:57.55]Where was that guy?
[117:59.29]It was green crystal and then from green... I just kind of don't remember where he was.
[118:05.07]Where did I go?
[118:15.72]Over there.
[118:16.04]Where do I go?
[118:22.08]It's green.
[118:23.42]Where do I go?
[118:32.74]Teleporter in the skull maze.
[118:36.98]Wow, we need to die, right?
[118:44.18]Just go to green.
[118:46.08]Die and go to green.
[118:53.42]It's in the middle.
[118:56.84]Okay, hold on.
[119:02.05]Go to the warp station.
[119:10.35]Don't I have to be dead to be at the warp station?
[119:12.17]That's the afterlife, isn't it?
[119:18.54]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[119:20.84]Yep, you're right, you're right.
[119:22.02]Yep.
[119:25.24]You're right.
[119:25.54]I forgot about this.
[119:37.28]So you think I'm strong enough to fight this thing?
[119:38.58]Let's find out.
[119:51.86]Maybe?
[119:52.16]I mean, this is a lot.
[119:55.10]Let's try it.
[119:56.06]Okay.
[119:57.52]Can't, like, go around or anything, right?
[120:20.17]Can I sneak in?
[120:25.61]Nope.
[120:28.49]Alright, I'll fight him.
[120:37.07]I wonder what the strategy here is.
[120:38.43]Take out the adds first.
[120:45.68]Yeah.
[120:47.62]And then let's do a panorama.
[120:51.69]Alright, that hurts a lot.
[121:08.34]Shit.
[121:08.68]There we go.
[121:15.54]Just don't die.
[121:23.45]I think we're okay.
[121:44.35]Jesus.
[121:50.47]Oh, that's self only.
[121:53.94]Oh, I thought that was okay.
[121:55.36]I'll just heal.
[122:00.19]Uh-oh.
[122:05.33]Oh, thank God.
[122:06.09]One health.
[122:06.45]Damn.
[122:06.55]Okay.
[122:24.42]The one on the right has been confused almost the whole time.
[122:25.88]I think we're good.
[122:53.76]That's not going to cause a problem, right, if I don't kill the adds first?
[122:56.68]No.
[122:57.00]Alright, let's do it.
[122:57.53]There's a lot of money back there.
[123:08.69]22 damage, that's it.
[123:09.39]Do it again.
[123:25.78]DPS race.
[123:28.72]I did it.
[123:31.28]Only 75 bucks.
[123:33.96]I kind of feel bad.
[123:43.97]Artificial bicep was found.
[123:45.59]50 bucks.
[123:50.89]That's it?
[123:55.80]100 bucks and that's it?
[123:56.80]Well, there's a TV in here.
[124:02.93]Detonation.
[124:05.33]Hmm.
[124:07.69]Ooh.
[124:09.05]Artificial bicep increases HP and strength.
[124:15.24]Yep.
[124:26.48]Definitely.
[124:32.48]What was that new power?
[124:33.24]Can you do that too?
[124:35.25]Jesus.
[124:48.05]Well, you can make 1080... 1080 30 is fine.
[124:48.73]1080 60 is okay too.
[124:49.19]It's... I prefer it the other way.
[124:49.99]Why did I read that?
[124:50.45]I don't know.
[125:11.61]Why are you reading the bot messages?
[125:14.36]I don't... I don't know.
[125:15.96]I looked over and I saw it.
[125:18.04]I saw somebody do that emote where I'm like... And I thought they were talking shit, so it was... That's an official message.
[125:24.94]Oops.

[126:46.70]Well, I don't know.
[126:48.41]Chat moves really fast sometimes.
[126:51.11]I look over and I just see somebody doing that emote and that emote usually means like, oh, look at me.

[144:32.01]This thing is kind of scary.
[144:33.09]Should I?
[144:38.07]Datoplasm?
[144:44.77]Can I interact?
[144:47.19]Oh, dear.
[144:57.11]Uh, alright.
[145:01.31]Detonate.
[145:07.48]Confusion.
[145:08.08]Bubbles.
[145:11.62]Let's go.
[145:18.00]Three?
[145:22.92]Oh, that hurts.
[145:26.87]That did a lot of damage though.
[145:28.23]Hold on.
[145:29.02]I might be able to survive this.
[145:37.46]That's a full heal.
[145:48.02]Leech is expensive.
[145:49.50]Should I try it?
[145:58.18]Oh, it's... Right, it's a drain.
[145:59.18]Alright.
[145:59.62]No, no, no.
[145:59.80]We're good.
[146:00.06]We're good.
[146:00.28]We're good.
[146:00.50]We're good.
[146:24.42]I think I am... As long as I can keep this up.
[146:27.64]Ancient odor?
[146:28.44]Oh, poison.
[146:31.84]That's bad.
[146:32.44]Uh-oh.
[146:45.27]Uh... Status.
[147:00.15]Come on!
[147:03.13]Don't hit Wayne.
[147:04.57]Good.
[147:04.85]Detonate.
[147:25.94]Sorry, I got the guard on.
[147:29.67]It's not bad.
[147:35.14]60 damage.
[147:35.60]Nice.
[147:48.06]I feel like I don't want to use the dynamite.
[147:51.18]I think we're just going to attack.
[147:54.43]Tac, you use vegetable on you, then you use vegetable on yourself.
[148:02.07]Yes!
[148:04.05]What'd I get?
[148:12.40]Jerkin?
[148:13.14]Parasite crystal?
[148:14.10]Ooh.
[148:16.60]Ooh.
[148:23.83]Is that all I can do?
[148:25.39]What did I get?
[148:25.87]This.
[148:33.97]Sensible everyday wear for the modern machine prevents paralysis.
[148:39.88]Okay.
[148:40.68]We should wear that.
[148:49.66]Probably you, Sunasa.
[148:55.72]Yeah.
[148:59.28]Okay.
[148:59.88]Prevents paralysis.
[149:04.00]Good.
[149:06.02]Re-equip the skull.
[149:06.87]It's one of the best head pieces.
[149:12.87]Is it?
[149:14.03]What is it doing?
[149:14.71]Demon skull?
[149:16.65]What are the stats on it?
[149:24.09]It's health?
[149:28.54]It's more HP.
[149:31.51]Okay.
[149:40.31]Keep that bell on.
[149:41.29]What about you?
[149:46.96]Artificial bicep.
[149:47.88]Probably the poncho, right?
[149:53.04]Toilet paper is probably awful.
[149:57.71]141 versus.
[150:01.17]Yeah, it's better.
[150:01.77]OK.
[150:06.02]Telepaper really does not do anything.
[150:07.30]I could optimize too if I really wanted to.
[150:08.88]Well, there we go.
[150:10.98]That's fun.
[150:13.72]Back to it.
[150:23.02]So now I can leave that I can leave the dock.
[150:33.25]thoughts on the game so far I think it's great didn't want to do that
[150:49.91]It's kind of like earthbound went through a bunch of, I mean, it's like a really cool art piece.
[150:59.14]The music's really cool.
[151:00.00]And it plays sort of like that earthbound kind of the party and you have to, I mean, it's, I like it.
[151:06.64]It's really cool.
[151:11.64]Did I explore everything here?
[151:13.26]I believe the answer to that question is yes.
[151:26.10]Correct, it is an RPG.
[151:29.08]Right, but it's like a television screen RPG.
[151:32.81]Here's what I mean by that.
[151:34.19]When you get into a battle, your party members are not on the screen.
[151:39.27]It's just, you're like a POV RPG.
[151:45.93]POV traditional turn-based RPG.
[151:56.79]Dragon Quest does this.
[152:02.76]And like the psychedelic powers and stuff.
[152:06.42]To me, that's Earthbound.
[152:19.46]What the fuck just happened?
[152:20.56]Whoa, where am I?
[152:21.65]What's going on?
[152:23.01]Whoa, what just happened?
[152:25.49]Wayne wrongfully prepares many behaviors, but Dorothy sniff his vessel?
[152:31.48]So every pain is a... whatever that word is... homunculus.
[152:33.78]And every chemical is like melancholy biscuit.
[152:37.34]What?
[153:01.10]What did I just do?
[153:02.23]I just punched that thing.
[153:05.73]Should I not be doing this?
[153:06.45]Pneumatic.
[153:11.03]I know.
[153:11.41]Ooh.
[153:13.11]A telephone?
[153:19.14]Okay.
[153:34.52]Interesting.
[153:39.42]Very cool.
[153:40.02]Alright, we can keep going.
[153:41.71]But, I want to go purchase stuff first.
[153:49.05]Yeah, the gate should be open now.
[153:57.49]Looks like it is.
[153:59.13]Ooh.
[153:59.53]I get 6,800.
[154:00.11]Chris's will by 50.
[154:01.89]I don't know.
[154:02.59]That's a lot of money.
[154:06.47]Ooh.
[154:29.63]Should I sell this stuff?
[154:33.32]Dude, you're rich.
[154:33.94]It's fine.
[154:35.48]I don't think so.
[154:40.12]You got a muscle thing in your inventory?
[154:45.11]Yeah.
[154:57.68]Who can wear that?
[155:06.83]Wait, what is that?
[155:13.07]Wait, what?
[155:17.81]Oh, what does that mean?
[155:21.04]Okay.
[155:23.70]Permanently increases mightiness by two.
[155:25.64]I feel like it's going to be Wayne, right?
[155:33.65]Give Wayne the heaviest attacks?
[155:35.68]I think that's probably what I'm gonna do.
[155:37.16]Okay.
[155:43.03]So Wayne is now permanently, right?
[155:47.81]Cool.
[155:49.41]59 mightiness.
[155:52.03]Nice.
[155:55.19]I need to go to the vegetable garden.
[156:17.76]Ooh.
[156:18.02]Two weapons.
[156:46.12]I could give it to Wayne.
[156:49.26]I think I'm going to give it to Wayne.
[157:06.63]Okay.
[157:10.11]Okay.
[157:11.43]Greatly increases maximum will.
[157:16.59]I'm losing mightiness, though.
[157:21.11]Oh, wait a minute.
[157:31.27]Oh, it's because I lose the bicep.
[157:33.69]Damn it.
[157:36.63]Is that alright?
[157:37.33]I think I need another axe first.
[157:39.43]Let's give it to you.
[157:47.93]I don't have another instrument for you.
[158:02.02]Please, brother, just wholly use your muscle.
[158:03.58]I did.
[158:04.24]I did.
[158:06.12]You went to go blow your nose and you came back.
[158:07.90]You went to go heat up a snack or something and you came back and I did it already.
[158:16.02]Alright, well, I have it now.
[158:22.50]When I find a good weapon, I will replace this.
[158:24.56]Yeah.

[159:03.97]Well, I mean, I have no idea what's going on in the story.
[159:06.21]It's like a pretty trippy kind of cool, interesting game, and I'm just enjoying the ride and the music and the chill vibes and the numbers that go up on screen.
[159:17.86]I'm chilling out with that.
[159:22.48]That's the mountain, so I think I'm good.
[159:23.52]I'm going to go up to the vegetable garden.
[159:34.74]That's code for I don't know what's going on.

[160:26.31]Shield made from a venerable beast.
[160:28.40]The wielder is immune to poison.
[160:37.98]Better than a trash can lid.
[160:43.38]This game has a meat grinder and bug food.

[178:46.40]What the hell?
[178:47.32]Why do you have so much health?
[178:58.40]Poison.
[179:02.60]Shit.
[179:02.88]Die!
[179:26.26]What the hell?
[179:33.23]Will the poison eventually kill the one on the right?
[179:42.43]I'm out of MP.
[179:47.86]I can't win.
[179:48.68]I have to leave.
[179:56.10]Bubbles on the one on the left.
[179:59.19]I think that's all I can do.
[179:59.99]Just hope the poison kills it.
[180:00.95]Okay.
[180:11.75]Die.
[180:12.87]Guard.
[180:13.21]Everybody guard until somebody dies from poison.
[180:20.94]The one on the left.
[180:22.58]This is like more than three, four, five hundred damage.
[180:34.16]Shit.
[180:34.66]I'm gonna... Bye.
[180:49.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[180:52.08]Actually, no.
[180:52.56]I can fight you.
[180:52.98]I don't even have to.
[180:56.38]Hog champ.
[181:19.23]Go, go, go.
[181:19.61]I think that's it down here.
[181:24.63]Pug champ.
[181:46.64]Ooh, TV.
[181:52.66]Person?
[181:56.62]Health chant.
[182:02.37]Is that all of them or is there more?
[182:07.23]One in the middle.
[182:10.03]Oh, get out of the way.
[182:11.30]Oh my god.
[182:22.89]No shit in the way fashion Be five four no five seven and five eight with shoes on and that person for a whole at least one full day.
[182:41.95]Oh
[182:51.44]Oh, it's blinking.
[182:57.06]Did I do it?
[182:57.68]Wait, was that blinking before?
[182:58.72]I don't remember.
[182:59.26]Well, let's just kill this stuff.
[183:05.19]Because I can.
[183:09.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[183:11.05]I didn't want to do that.
[183:11.85]I hit right.
[183:13.03]Right, like, just passes, and I didn't want to pass.
[183:17.96]Oh, that's bad.
[183:28.57]Sour Patch Kid.
[183:35.92]I gotta look at some Snoss's gear, because... It's... We are not hurting anything with that character.
[183:55.72]Yeah, 65, 63, 15.
[183:56.66]Oh, no, no, no.
[184:07.11]It is.
[184:07.43]Okay, they're attacking out of order.
[184:09.13]Might as well just clear it.
[184:22.32]Dead.
[184:23.51]It's based on speed.
[184:27.97]Damn.
[184:28.87]Oh my god, that was bad.
[184:51.15]No, no, no, I want you to be healing people and you to attack.
[185:19.21]Yeah, I'm 5'8".
[185:20.05]Hey, but who gives a shit how tall anybody is?
[185:29.47]Doesn't matter.
[185:33.99]Nothing moved above ground.
[185:35.25]You could be 6 feet tall, you could be 7 feet tall, you could be 5'2", you could be 5'1".
[185:46.50]We're all so different.
[185:48.84]We all have our own things that we can do.
[185:51.65]We all have different skills.
[185:54.87]And time out everyone saying five.
[185:58.35]You know what I mean?
[185:59.29]Time them out.
[185:59.95]Delete them.
[186:11.60]Something moved above ground.
[186:13.02]What was it?
[186:29.90]I actually like being shorter.
[186:37.15]You know how much better it is to... I can nap on the couch perfectly.
[186:42.65]It's great.
[186:45.65]Yeah, that's fine.
[186:46.85]Do you want to cope?
[186:48.06]I can fit into little places and shit?
[186:50.92]It's great.
[186:51.44]I don't give a shit how tall I am.
[187:11.07]Up here, maybe?
[187:15.53]What is going on here?
[187:16.67]Somebody stashed two frozen burritos here.
[187:18.49]Ooh.
[187:21.52]Yeah, yeah, don't ever forget who actually threw the ring into Mount Doom.
[187:26.70]Don't forget who did that.
[187:28.92]It wasn't a gigantic orc.
[187:30.56]It wasn't Gandalf.
[187:32.86]Who was it?
[187:33.58]Who did it?
[187:33.96]Huh?
[187:37.56]Who did it?
[187:37.92]I don't hear any rebuttals to that.
[187:56.23]Gandalf.
[187:58.67]What?
[187:59.19]Gandalf.
[188:00.55]How do you pronounce it?
[188:02.63]It's Gandalf.
[188:05.39]Gandalf.
[188:07.65]That's how you say Gandalf.
[188:17.79]Did something happened above ground?
[188:21.82]What happened?
[188:36.39]Oh, this happened.
[188:42.21]Oh, shit.
[188:43.43]Gandalf.
[188:44.47]Gandalf.
[189:15.51]Demon skull was found.
[189:16.83]I already have one of those, but cool.
[189:24.83]Weird.
[189:33.19]That's good.
[189:34.47]Uh, let's attack normally.
[189:35.61]No!
[189:36.03]I... I wish I didn't do that.
[189:38.81]Press right without being selected.
[189:41.22]You just pass the turn.
[189:50.37]Did it work?
[189:50.81]I didn't see.
[189:51.69]Ooh, they're hurting each other.
[189:55.49]Nice.
[189:55.71]Confused.
[190:18.97]Who has the antiparalysis on?
[190:20.27]Somebody does.
[190:22.55]Meat found, meat found.
[190:27.49]Oh, water.
[190:48.94]Blue was the heaven above me, and the Earth green at my feet.
[190:52.52]O life, O life, I kept saying, and the very words seemed sweet.
[190:57.84]No.
[191:00.51]Gather our platinum art, she said, and spirit considers our doom.
[191:06.07]Hmm.
[191:10.45]Okay.
[191:11.75]Hmm.
[191:19.26]Vegetables?
[191:19.76]I feel like I'm being prepared for something.
[191:31.09]Duck blade was found.
[191:39.14]Small chance of lowering target's mightiness.
[191:43.06]Duck blade.
[191:43.76]Is it worth putting on the...
[191:48.85]What is this here?
[191:50.05]This thing?
[191:52.73]78.
[191:53.44]Alright.
[191:55.50]Nice.
[191:57.08]I don't care about the blindness right now.
[192:07.27]This is probably better.
[192:09.41]That is what I'm going to use.
[192:13.57]Is this still like best in slot for this person?
[192:16.25]I feel like I'm missing out.
[192:26.55]I want the damage.
[192:29.49]You missed a party member.
[192:39.89]Oh, oh, oh.
[192:42.20]Find it, baby.
[192:44.20]Fire wave.
[192:56.79]This hurts a lot.
[192:59.11]Wow, poison damage really kills this thing bad.
[193:01.85]Uh-oh.
[193:29.13]They're multiplying.
[193:40.06]Ow.
[193:41.54]Ow!
[193:43.02]Wow, that hurts. ...
[193:57.37]Get rid of these things before they... They could probably overwhelm you.
[193:59.59]This is doing 125 damage.
[194:00.65]That's gotta be doing like 2 plus 100 damage every time.
[194:31.05]125?
[194:31.09]Stop!
[194:38.85]Stop spawning!
[194:46.58]Is poisoning the same one over and over again going to do anything?
[194:49.22]I was hoping it was going to stack.
[194:51.68]That might not be the case, though.
[194:55.10]Okay, well, we need to do this now.
[195:01.85]Do it again.
[195:14.02]They normally don't in RPGs.
[195:15.68]That's true.
[195:19.70]I gotta start focusing on the little ones.
[195:21.12]Yeah, these little ones have to die.
[195:24.82]I'm going to get overwhelmed here in a minute.
[195:35.22]They keep spawning!
[195:44.50]Die!
[195:50.77]I'm in deep trouble.
[195:56.87]I'm going for it.
[196:05.91]Yes!
[196:14.47]Got kinda hairy.
[196:21.24]Is this like a boss?
[196:29.13]This thing is pretty difficult being just a regular enemy.
[196:44.79]Mini boss.
[196:45.45]Here we go.
[196:49.81]5000 bucks.
[196:55.74]Tons of vegetables.
[197:05.11]I have an unbelievable amount of vegetables.
[197:06.69]Okay.
[197:07.91]Oh.
[197:08.51]Are these enemies?
[197:10.73]Oh.
[197:34.21]Really?
[197:34.83]This thing's attacked?
[198:05.89]Uh-oh.
[198:06.83]Ah, yeah, they do.
[198:08.38]Of course they do.
[198:10.52]Found meat.
[198:11.90]Now how do I get out of here?
[198:12.92]Oh, I'm dead.
[198:13.46]Goodbye.
[198:14.18]I got lots of meat, though.
[198:31.76]So where's this other... I missed something, right?
[198:37.03]Somebody said there's an island I didn't explore.
[198:49.75]Well, I kind of want to see it.
[198:53.12]Party member on the island.
[198:58.48]This way.
[199:11.20]Where are they from here?
[199:12.32]Wrong warp.
[199:13.34]Wrong warp.
[199:14.04]Wrong warp.
[199:14.70]Water cups?
[199:45.27]It's fine, just go down.
[199:46.31]Hey, I haven't found any more cups.
[199:49.53]Okay, here's the city.
[199:53.13]I wonder if we should buy something else here.
[200:17.80]I should probably get the vegetables, if I'm honest.
[200:20.95]Yeah.
[200:21.57]Let's do that.
[200:40.46]This game feels like what sleep deprivation feels like.
[200:45.15]You can see that.
[200:53.43]Okay.
[200:54.59]So... Um... Go to the dock?
[201:10.72]Uh...
[201:15.83]Okay.
[201:16.20]Oh, I didn't go here.
[201:17.84]That's right.
[201:18.40]Wait, what's that?
[201:36.62]The lever is off limits.
[201:37.58]I don't recommend pushing the button either.
[201:44.08]Please don't touch the lever.
[201:46.62]Please don't.
[201:54.17]Don't touch the lever.
[201:56.35]Off limits.
[201:59.17]Okay.
[202:00.17]I can't.
[202:00.91]Okay.
[202:08.39]Can I do anything else?
[202:13.03]Please stop pushing the button.
[202:19.61]Don't push it.
[202:24.31]I'll give you these muscle apliques.
[202:27.07]Just stop pushing it.
[202:28.19]Oh.
[202:29.69]Why do I keep going?
[202:35.25]That sound, like fatal spirit rays.
[202:37.72]Uh-oh.
[202:40.60]Is he gonna get mad?
[202:41.80]Consider delusion spirits slowly stretched.
[202:53.64]You're a button-pressing maniac.
[202:55.11]Take this.
[202:57.87]Nice.
[202:58.25]Now, Gull, there's nothing more for you.
[202:59.85]May you prepare in lards.
[203:03.61]I got a cup.
[203:06.00]Is that it?
[203:07.50]Cool.
[203:28.31]I'm giving all the power to Wayne.
[203:29.89]That's funny.
[203:32.23]Okay.
[203:33.15]Cool.
[203:37.25]Interact with the bugs?
[203:42.87]What?
[203:45.07]What?
[203:46.15]Whoa.
[203:47.29]Converted the bug into might?
[203:49.49]For who?
[203:49.85]What?
[203:59.16]This is a TV.
[204:06.16]Inserts.
[204:06.68]Whoa.
[204:07.50]Okay.
[204:11.56]Token one.
[204:14.19]Token two.
[204:14.87]I need one more token.
[204:21.05]And then this will turn on.
[204:21.81]Got it.
[204:24.27]Let's go.
[204:30.18]Oops.
[204:35.81]Okay.
[204:37.73]This is the only place I have not gone is the middle here.
[204:40.29]Little town up here.
[205:01.97]Okay, what's this for?
[205:15.65]I don't think I can do anything here.
[205:16.69]It's like triple worm, poop worm, single worm, ultra poop worm.
[205:29.91]Foiled Worm, Single Worm, Worm, whatever.
[205:34.21]Somebody will remember.
[205:34.87]No, I'm trying to break that.
[206:05.52]Paper Cup.
[206:08.32]That's 25 mana?
[206:09.22]Yep.
[206:09.48]What's happening here?
[206:16.24]The Bulbulinks at noonday sing more softly than the softest flute and lightlier than the lightest lute.
[206:23.80]Their fairy tambours ring.
[206:28.84]He falsifies its mechanized homunculus and skeleton forgetted its convexity.
[206:34.00]Uh-oh.
[206:38.83]Hey, squirrel food.
[206:40.05]I've got squirrel food.
[206:41.03]2,000 for some squirrel food.
[206:43.39]Yes, I've seen a couple squirrels.
[206:45.29]For sure.
[206:45.59]I think I will just stand here forever.
[206:49.27]Alright, I got squirrel food.
[206:51.54]Squirrel food forever.
[206:52.54]You know what I was trying to say.
[207:02.09]okay so it was this one this one this one and this one nice
[207:27.82]I am called Ungorma, greatest of the Dread Knights of Vithorn.
[207:32.66]For long ages I have waited in this vault.
[207:35.96]Fight me.
[207:37.86]Uh, not yet.
[207:39.16]So it goes.
[207:39.64]I want to watch your TV first.
[207:47.73]Dark Flame.
[207:55.87]Whoa.
[207:59.22]Alright, let's go.
[207:59.76]I think I've got enough.
[208:03.96]Gorma.
[208:06.04]Prepare yourself.
[208:11.07]It's always clear the adds first, right?
[208:12.51]Pretty much always.
[208:16.61]Damages all enemies slightly stronger than a normal attack.
[208:19.15]Let's try it.
[208:19.59]Yeah, let's go for it.
[208:23.29]Just do it three times.
[208:24.85]Fuck it.
[208:29.80]It's pretty powerful.
[208:31.55]Nice.
[208:33.83]Alright, now we just focus.
[209:00.22]That's pretty good.
[209:01.92]86 damage.
[209:12.63]Health chant.
[209:13.13]Here we go.
[209:15.51]We're pretty beefed up right now.
[209:20.61]I am defeated.
[209:21.43]Very well.
[209:21.81]I will follow you and aid you in your violent endeavors.
[209:25.40]By the way, I have dominion over the ambulant skulls.
[209:28.28]You don't need to fear them anymore.
[209:32.19]Oh shit, that's actually really helpful.
[209:37.91]Joyous?
[209:38.41]That thing's pretty heavy.
[209:47.90]Full party, yeah?
[209:50.16]Sleep on the couch too.
[209:51.38]Oh, come on, really?
[210:03.15]Yeah, watch the TV so you can get the skill.
[210:05.17]Yeah, so just realizing right now that's how this works.
[210:10.39]Very cool.
[210:10.83]Alright, so we got a full party.
[210:12.04]There was one other place on this island I could go to over here in the middle.
[210:20.00]Is that something to go to?
[210:21.50]No.
[210:22.66]Alright.
[210:25.36]Let's continue the progress.
[210:31.20]Quick, name all the people in the party right now.
[210:33.14]Prove I know who they are.
[210:34.88]Wayne.
[210:37.16]Daedususus.
[210:38.70]Whatever the name was.
[210:41.22]Somsnosa.
[210:43.50]And... Vith... Vithyrial or something.
[210:52.37]Whatever it was.
[210:53.01]Let's see.
[210:54.91]Oh, no.
[210:55.57]Pongorma.
[210:57.63]He said he was like a Vithyrial knight.
[211:00.72]I think I was close enough.
[211:02.66]Okay.
[211:03.60]I was, I was just went let's go.
[211:41.68]Just join the party and you already forgot them.
[211:44.84]It's alright.
[211:47.85]Let's-a go!
[211:51.71]Let's-a play!
[212:05.40]Three hours, 33 minutes, and 33 seconds.
[212:08.56]That's kind of cool.
[212:09.74]Uh, let me heal.
[212:11.65]Wow, I have many more juice boxes.
[212:24.07]Honest to goodness.
[212:26.83]Wait, save it.
[212:39.59]Okay.
[212:41.57]Run from the statue.
[212:42.43]It's the red portal.
[212:45.99]I went down last time.
[212:47.17]This time I'm not going to go down.
[212:48.29]I'm going to go up.
[212:58.06]Left, maybe?
[212:58.62]Wait, what about up?
[213:05.22]Oh, shit.
[213:05.70]I found it.
[213:06.04]Did I get it?
[213:08.64]I got it.
[213:08.98]I got it.
[213:09.58]I got it.
[213:09.90]I got it.
[213:10.50]I was lucky.
[213:13.20]Where the hell am I?
[213:19.83]At last, at last, the lard is bungled inside offending convexatives.
[213:26.47]Wayne is miraculously considering a mountain below insects.
[213:31.54]Where it's out of mere mandibles and memories, this pneumatic being will not be actualized.
[213:38.75]And now the time for austere corrosion arts draw to an end.
[213:43.09]Gibi, shining, works strongly below the lordly lunar fortress.
[213:48.35]This season yearns for theory, below the vent, amidst the mirror.
[213:54.05]Act three.
[213:59.85]I touch everything.
[214:00.43]Press every button.
[214:01.11]OK.
[214:01.99]Oh.
[214:31.50]Act 3.
[214:33.20]Summon an airship.
[214:35.79]Uh... Yes?
[214:45.85]Oh, now we can go to these other places.
[214:48.01]Alright, where should I go?
[214:56.10]This house up here?
[215:01.32]What's over here?
[215:05.87]Wait, what?
[215:06.45]What's going on?
[215:06.91]Do we have instruments?
[215:08.23]Is this a concert?
[215:15.15]Oh, when it shunned his face, I exalted that taste.
[215:18.09]Hey now, his joyful creature.
[215:19.67]Hey now.
[215:23.17]To play music?
[215:28.98]Juice pack.
[215:30.46]Oh, TV.
[215:38.43]Dissect.
[215:46.56]Damages all enemies and removes positive statuses.
[215:49.08]That's pretty good.
[215:54.07]Yo.
[215:55.49]Apparel passion.
[215:56.55]Passion apparel.
[215:58.85]And speaking of apparel.
[216:00.51]GrottoBeast.net
[216:03.29]You can find yourself some hoodies, t-shirts, all with the Grotto Beasts logo or some cool prints on it.
[216:14.46]This, this is my digestion jam.
[216:23.08]Are we actually, can we play music?
[216:26.60]One of our fishes is here.
[216:28.76]Shall I recite the music tutorial?
[216:30.96]Yes.
[216:32.19]Keys one through four play notes and key five to change style.
[216:36.32]What?
[217:15.13]Alright, you play.
[217:51.86]It's kind of like if somebody picks a guitar up.
[217:54.54]So you're a guitarist.
[217:57.02]And you play the guitar pretty well.
[217:59.74]But somebody decides that they're gonna pick it up.
[218:02.44]And be like, oh, you know, I know a little bit.
[218:04.26]I know a little bit.
[218:05.13]Just because they can't stand to be shown up in the same room as you.
[218:09.45]So they pick the guitar up and they play like three chords.
[218:11.25]They know how to play.
[218:12.81]Just to make it seem like that they know how to play the guitar.
[218:15.77]Because like you can't have this.
[218:17.09]Like you can't have this.
[218:17.95]I'm sorry.
[218:18.75]I have this too.
[218:20.42]See?
[218:20.64]I can play that.
[218:26.13]This is a Seinfeld routine?
[218:29.01]Well, whatever.
[218:29.55]In that episode of Seinfeld, it was funny.
[218:31.11]Alright, I'm going to try.
[218:39.38]Alright, here we go.
[218:56.45]What should I do?
[218:58.17]Super Mario?
[218:58.75]Make the other people in the band play?
[219:07.10]I think I already am.
[219:39.49]This is the worst concert I've ever been to.
[219:52.48]Try harder.
[219:53.50]I am.
[219:54.02]I'm trying.
[219:54.56]Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[220:12.82]Is this?
[220:13.24]I want to check out this thing too.
[220:17.04]Yeah, whatever this is.
[220:17.82]Can I do something here?
[220:20.79]No.
[220:25.03]This is a kind of land here.
[220:27.91]What's this place?
[220:38.28]Juice pack.
[220:40.02]TV.
[220:46.33]Illusion form.
[220:51.23]Temporarily change appearance.
[220:52.85]Purely cosmetic.
[221:01.06]Oh, sick.
[221:01.56]Remember that new party?
[221:02.52]Remember we got TV?
[221:04.72]Hey, I got horse food.
[221:08.98]3,000 bucks?
[221:09.46]Yeah.
[221:17.37]Where are the horses and where are the squirrels?
[221:35.15]Squirrels are back at the house.
[221:41.56]Yep, squirrel.
[221:45.00]Give squirrel food.
[221:46.64]Acquired head squirrel.
[221:47.96]Is this a horse?
[221:51.76]Horse food.
[221:52.28]Acquired horse.
[221:55.25]Huh.
[222:03.05]Loyal head squirrel prevents negative status effects.
[222:05.31]That's amazing.
[222:07.39]Increases chance of preemptive attack.
[222:09.09]Raises mightiness.
[222:10.51]Okay, that's a lot.
[222:12.79]Yeah.
[222:23.58]Wait, is that just an item?
[222:28.88]No, it's an outfit.
[222:31.44]Wait, why can I not put it on?
[222:37.00]Oh, it's because of that.
[222:37.68]This is okay.
[222:40.93]What's better?
[222:41.43]Uh, Wayne with the... Axe?
[222:45.35]Should I trade the... I think I'm gonna trade... Concormus.

[223:02.75]Yeah, look at this shit.
[223:03.83]101 mightiness.
[223:10.95]Okay, Wayne's going to be the absolute destroyer.
[223:13.09]Okay.
[223:24.58]Artificial bicep.

[223:41.07]I think this is all good.
[223:43.25]Wait, maybe, nah.
[223:51.11]I think I'm good with this.
[223:53.37]Or is it time to take the combat bell off of to make him a little better?
[224:02.06]What the hell is that emote?

[225:06.51]There's one more place up there.
[225:07.88]It's like a big castle.

[225:47.73]Check in with Claw Man before you head to the lab.
[225:50.03]What?
[225:57.73]You're not allowed to enter the lab without Claw Man's permission.
[226:00.77]Who the hell is Claw Man?
[226:08.67]That would look to be Claw Man, if I were to guess.
[226:20.48]Nice to finally meet you.

[226:42.73]Hope?
[226:48.11]I'm gonna say Pneumatic Art.
[226:50.50]Not that either.
[226:51.18]Stop joking around.

[244:12.26]Ah, damn.
[244:19.15]Is this a sponsored stream?
[244:23.22]Why the hell would this be a sponsored stream?
[244:25.06]This game came out like fucking six years ago.
[244:31.52]What?
[244:33.88]When did this game come out?
[244:34.66]Like 2016?
[244:34.82]2013?
[244:34.88]How long has this game been out for?
[244:37.37]It was eight years ago.
[244:50.37]That would be crazy.
[244:51.39]I'm ready.
[245:19.78]whatever this is we're seeing it you got the sponsorship eight years ago and they were just really lenient on the time frame oh my god that would be awful yeah I mean back when I was in the middle of making youtube videos yeah I just it didn't have a time frame on it it just said at some point in the future and I was like yeah sure
[245:50.02]Always read your contracts.
[245:51.92]That's what I will tell you.
[245:56.26]There was no time frame.
[245:57.68]That would be so fucked up.
[246:00.10]But no, this game's just really cool.
[246:02.26]And we're just hanging out.
[246:04.48]We're just chilling.
[246:05.40]That's it.
[246:07.48]Am I interested in a hot dogs or perhaps a spaceship key?
[246:11.02]Yes.
[246:14.03]I'll take that.
[246:14.87]Look at my money.
[246:15.45]I'm fucking loaded.
[246:16.33]I could buy two if I wanted to.
[246:35.30]oh shit um I want to try this I want to try the super attack I'm going to try the legend of melting see what it does
[246:55.24]Hmm.
[246:55.78]Okay.
[246:59.52]Legend of Melting.
[247:04.94]Alright.
[247:21.03]Cool.
[247:22.41]This is the spaceship, then.
[247:27.18]Spaceship is the endgame.
[247:28.12]Uh... I think... I think I did pretty much anything.
[247:35.90]Everything I could have done.
[247:36.72]Maybe there's probably some secrets I didn't see, but... I think I saw mostly everything.
[247:42.69]Yeah, I think I did everything.
[247:43.77]I've been to every island.
[247:46.37]I went and did everything in the underground.
[247:48.71]Yeah, I did it all.
[247:49.39]Okay.
[247:50.94]Let's turn the spaceship on.
[248:13.85]I'm just gonna buy an absolute shitload of hot dogs.
[248:16.31]Do I need $600,000 for it?
[248:18.93]I'm just gonna buy a thousand of these.
[248:29.25]I'd buy 50 of them.
[248:34.75]Go buy juice in the city.
[248:39.37]Where do you buy juice?
[248:40.35]I didn't find a place to buy it.
[248:47.76]Was there a place in the city to buy juice?
[248:49.22]I didn't see it.
[248:54.44]Juice is only from kills.
[249:00.49]I think I'll be alright.
[249:01.47]I'm gonna buy like 10 of these.
[249:03.09]Or like 20.
[249:03.61]I got $600,000.
[249:05.97]Yeah, let's go.
[249:06.91]Let's do it.
[249:09.89]I'm ready.
[249:10.19]Let's move.
[249:23.34]I have it saved right before this, so...
[249:35.33]Oh.
[249:46.70]Anything else?
[249:58.65]Wait, what about this little thing?
[249:59.65]Can I go this way?
[250:00.29]Nope.
[250:10.91]Have you ever tried Cruelty Squad?
[250:13.29]I have not seen Cruelty Squad.
[250:16.71]Well, I've seen it, but I've not played it.
[250:19.05]I feel like the game I know is awesome.
[250:22.81]I've been told it's fucking awesome.
[250:26.53]But it looks a little harsh.
[250:29.99]Looks like my brain would probably get hurt.
[250:31.41]It would probably give me a headache.
[250:34.51]Let me ask you a question.
[250:36.26]If I can handle this, could I handle Cruelty Squad?
[250:43.41]I heard it's awesome, but yeah, you think so?
[250:50.25]It gave me a headache, gave me a headache.
[250:52.19]Maybe you know what I'll do?
[250:52.93]Maybe I'll jump into it for like 20 minutes or so off stream to see how I feel, because I believe it or not, I do have like audio visual stimulation that sometimes it can actually give me a headache.
[251:04.27]Sometimes I tell you when I'm in the Half-Life 2 boat level, I almost puked and had to lie down on my floor for like 10 minutes in between.
[251:11.18]Bits of that game.
[251:13.52]I remember lying on my back on the floor.
[251:17.10]Should not throw up playing Half-Life 2.
[251:23.36]What is going on here?
[251:24.10]Do I have to fight all these?
[251:32.59]Entering the palace is forbidden.
[251:33.91]Leave now or be destroyed.

[261:38.72]Let's do that.
[261:39.24]157 damage.
[261:41.62]That's a lot.
[261:49.39]Alright, I need to eat that hot dog.
[261:52.79]Why have you not eaten the hot dog yet?
[261:58.36]Eat the hot dog.
[261:59.56]I told you to eat a hot dog.
[262:02.00]Why have you not eaten the hot dog yet?
[262:05.56]Eat the hot dog!
[262:14.60]Finally.
[262:15.00]Why is it taking you so long to eat a fucking hot dog?
[262:22.13]Okay.
[262:22.39]We're just gonna go straight up attack?
[262:33.10]Good.
[262:36.88]Eat the hot dog!
[262:51.68]Alright, much better shape now.
[263:02.45]Okay, the Dallas man is just going to feed people hot dogs.
[263:09.94]That's the only thing he's doing.
[263:18.06]That hurts so bad.
[263:23.79]Alright, hot dog strategy's paying off.
[263:25.69]Oh.
[263:35.33]Poison, good.
[263:39.83]The detonate should be like two or three hundred, right?
[263:53.65]400 damage.
[263:54.81]Can I do it again?
[263:55.67]I cannot, but I'll do this.
[264:05.35]What am I doing?
[264:05.99]All you do is feed people hot dogs.
[264:07.31]That's the only thing I want you to do.
[264:16.56]Status protection.
[264:21.52]Oh shit, that's right.
[264:23.85]Alright, hot dog coming up.
[264:31.89]250 for the poison, holy shit.
[264:34.03]Okay.
[264:34.15]250, that poison is so good.
[264:53.87]Hot dog.
[264:55.81]I think we're getting close.
[265:11.26]Fastest hot dog shooter.
[265:12.36]I don't know, I've never seen anybody do it like this.
[265:15.06]Let's go ahead and do calibration.
[265:30.24]Die.
[265:39.78]This seems like overkill, but I have like 50 of them, so I'm going to do it.
[265:42.80]Detonate.
[265:47.42]Bubbles, because that's going to be poison.
[265:50.71]You eat a hot dog this time and you attack.
[265:53.61]Got it.
[265:58.87]GG.
[265:59.01]GG.
[266:04.76]999,000 bucks.
[266:08.00]Found a hot dog.
[266:10.10]Wayne is now level 63.
[266:12.14]Everybody's level 63.
[266:12.98]Oh, I am defeated.
[266:19.19]Wayne, I'm sorry about everything.
[266:23.55]By the way, I set this moon to explode when I die.
[266:26.57]Say your prayers and purify your vacuums.
[266:30.27]Like being memory-o...
[266:38.50]Sit on the throne.
[266:43.78]Anything?
[266:46.92]Anything?
[266:47.26]I just leave?
[266:48.56]Okay, go.
[266:54.13]Oh no.
[266:58.77]Pick this person up and carry them out.
[267:15.05]Oh, no.
[267:20.65]But Wayne, hideous, luxuriously adrift, witnessed the chemical amidst the delusion vacuum of the government's irradiance renders greatly, so doth her homunculus pilot beside Ray's.
[267:35.07]So ends the tale of the modified beasts who sought to witness yet sort of expansively texturized radiance.
[267:51.19]The lever that I wasn't supposed to touch.
[267:58.84]Interesting.
[268:04.34]The end.
[268:06.24]Wait, what?
[268:07.52]That's what it was?
[268:10.94]Don't touch that lever.
[268:12.36]It makes the... Uh-oh.
[268:22.93]Am I missing something?
[268:31.82]Get the boat?
[268:33.16]I broke it.
[268:47.86]Did I win?
[268:48.30]So what do I do now?
[269:06.23]What about that person that was walking around Act 1, Act 2, Act 3?
[269:08.81]No, spam the lever.
[269:09.40]No, I didn't do it.
[269:34.73]That is the end.
[269:38.74]With apologies?
[269:40.08]Wait, with apologies?
[269:43.76]What was that?
[269:50.14]Remember event position, more self switches, night runners, variable display.
[269:54.12]Oh, I think it's random.
[270:01.91]That was really cool.
[270:02.97]That was a very enjoyable game.
[270:06.44]Oh.
[270:07.46]What's this?
[270:08.88]Well, that's it.
[270:09.34]If there isn't anything more, shall we return to the main menu?
[270:13.05]Okay, let's just chill out here for a while.
[270:23.83]Check your stats.
[270:25.47]1.6 million bucks? ...
[270:36.41]Oh, that's a lot.
[270:42.11]Damn.
[270:44.59]Heal.
[270:44.97]True.
[270:45.97]4, 5,000.
[270:47.01]Damn.
[270:47.33]9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9.
[270:47.98]Damn.
[270:50.18]Cool.
[270:50.52]So what happens if I say yes?
[271:09.90]Is there any, like, super boss that I have to kill?
[271:11.82]Because now I have a ton of HP or something?
[271:15.34]Or is that just kind of it?
[271:21.37]Spell the end with the letters.
[271:25.55]Um, I did.
[271:28.53]That's the game.
[271:29.39]Well, that was cool.
[271:30.03]Alright.
[271:34.05]Well done.
[271:35.91]Let's see what happens.
[271:36.57]Is it going to be... Yeah, there it is.
[271:39.18]That was Hylics 1.
[271:40.14]We are going to absolutely play Hylics 2.
[271:44.22]I like that.
[271:44.64]That was cool.
[271:45.14]I liked it a lot.
[271:55.47]So is Hylics 2 a direct sequel?
[272:00.17]Or is it just Hylics but a different... Is this a...
[272:05.46]Yes, it's a direct sequel.
[272:06.32]I just didn't know if it was some kind of standalone experience or something.
[272:15.16]Do we get any more info?
[272:16.18]Don't tell me.
[272:17.24]It's a dumb thing to ask before playing it.
[272:23.57]But yeah.
[272:24.55]Awesome.
[272:26.73]Hylics.
[272:28.55]Currently $3 on Steam right now.
[272:32.05]Game's been out for a long time, but
[272:35.26]A lot of people have been requesting I play this for a while.
[272:38.76]We'll definitely play the second one, too.
[272:43.66]That's a steal.
[272:47.64]I mean, like, that was a four, like three and a half hour, four hour experience.
[272:53.09]Two bucks.
[272:54.59]Come on.
[272:55.63]Come on, Gwen.
[273:00.71]I liked it a lot.

[273:47.38]Yeah, I... I don't... I can't give this game a rating.
[273:51.03]I don't think it... I don't think I want to.
[273:54.75]I think I would just say this is a recommended experience.
[274:02.87]Because to me...
[274:07.03]It was a great time.
[274:09.99]But I don't think that the experience that I had here, I could be like, well, it was an X out of 10.
[274:14.43]No, no, it was just great.
[274:16.58]It was just really cool.
[274:23.70]Okay, if you want it to be rated, if this has to be a rating for you, this is for the experience.
[274:30.51]For the experience.
[274:31.75]For the experience.
[274:35.21]It is a good plus.
[274:37.65]Good plus.
[274:43.71]I'm not giving this a number rating.
[274:44.95]I don't think you can.
[274:46.29]I think it's just a good plus.
[274:48.66]Which means that was fucking fun.
[274:50.40]That was great.
[275:02.13]This game was in a museum as a demo.
[275:06.35]Yeah, this game was to me was like more of like a art journey and like an experience.
[275:10.87]That was good plus.
[275:24.10]Good plus.
[275:24.86]What about good plus plus?
[275:31.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[275:32.30]This was great.
[275:34.08]This was great plus.
[275:37.42]Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[275:39.26]It was a very wonderful experience.
[275:41.18]Highly recommended.
[275:41.86]It's only $3.
[275:42.14]And I can't wait to play the second one.
[275:49.46]Loved it.
[275:55.41]And that's going to be the end of the stream.
[275:56.35]I think it's a good place to call it.
[275:57.17]I'm going to go eat some pizza.
[276:04.16]Well done.
[276:07.96]But yeah, I will see you guys the next time you will see me is maybe Sunday?
[276:23.01]Sunday, Monday?
[276:23.53]We'll go Sunday.
[276:25.89]Stick around on the weekend.
[276:26.73]I'll go Sunday.
[276:28.45]Sunday night.
[276:35.08]But yeah.
[276:36.98]Take care.
[276:37.26]Not sure what we're going to do on Sunday.
[276:38.46]I don't think we're going to do Hylics 2 on Sunday.
[276:40.54]Change it up a little bit.
[276:42.44]And that's it.
[276:53.68]Play The Long Drive?
[277:01.50]Maybe.
[277:03.35]Maybe.
[277:06.28]We'll see.
[277:06.86]Are you going to do facecam?
[277:12.42]I was on cam today.
[277:15.32]Facecam is not going to be a focus anymore.
[277:20.83]With it off, I can kind of just relax.
[277:23.69]I'm just going to play, hang out.
[277:26.99]Yeah, you'll see me from now on again.
[277:28.65]You'll see me.
[277:29.11]You saw me today.
[277:33.92]It's going back to the way that it was pre, like, 2019.
[277:37.08]Pre-2020.
[277:39.25]Where, yeah, if I'm going to play a horror game, it's going to be on.
[277:44.29]If I'm going to do something where you need to see my face, it's going to be on.
[277:48.13]If I feel like just turning it on one day and playing, it's going to turn on.
[277:52.69]Just not every single day.
[277:54.09]I'm having a lot more... The word's not fun, but I really like this different environment.
[278:05.18]a little bit more comfortable.
[278:10.89]I do like being on facecam, right?
[278:12.33]But I've been enjoying this a lot, so I'm going to keep doing it.
[278:20.14]What about sorcery?
[278:21.06]I know that person's mother is pissed.
[278:43.23]Neon white on Sunday?
[278:44.43]Hmm.
[278:47.99]We'll see.
[278:49.19]I'll be in pre-stream like 30-40 minutes before the stream.
[278:52.67]Figure it out.
[278:53.03]Alright, goodnight guys.
[278:57.03]See you later.
[278:57.86]Take care of yourselves.
[279:02.26]See you Sunday.
[279:09.14]Have a great rest of your evening.
