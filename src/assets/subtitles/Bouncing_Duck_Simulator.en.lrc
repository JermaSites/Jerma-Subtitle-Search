[00:00.66]How's it going?
[00:03.12]What's up?
[00:11.50]How you doing?
[00:15.50]Hi.
[00:18.26]Today, we're gonna play Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[00:21.63]For those of you that watched the Team Fortress 2 man versus machine stream,
[00:29.62]then you would know that Poke gave us a pretty good recommendation to play this game.
[00:38.46]So we'll find out.
[00:40.82]I do trust Poke's game recommendations.
[00:43.88]He plays a lot of interesting stuff.
[00:46.52]So here we go.
[00:51.11]It looks kind of good.
[00:58.60]It looks pretty good.
[01:00.80]I feel like I'm going to have fun with this for a little while.
[01:10.79]I thought you retired.
[01:11.75]I mean, yeah.
[01:17.85]Doesn't mean I'm not going to stream when I feel like it and make YouTube videos still and work it off brand and check in.
[01:25.40]Yeah, what's up?
[01:26.02]I'm here.
[01:26.94]I'm right here.
[01:28.85]I'm right here.
[01:29.73]I'm still here.
[01:35.79]He's a YouTuber now.
[01:45.32]I can still hear him.
[01:46.74]Yeah, because I'm live right now about to play Bouncing Duck Simulator.
[01:51.34]Alright, you guys ready?
[01:55.73]I don't know.
[01:55.99]The stream might not be too long.
[01:57.51]I know Armored Core 6 is the elephant in the room.
[02:01.39]But we'll see.
[02:03.11]I did say I wanted to play this too.
[02:05.83]Maybe I'll try Armored Core 6 on my own.
[02:08.49]Maybe I'll stream it.
[02:09.67]Maybe I won't.
[02:10.99]Maybe we'll play Sorcery.
[02:13.05]I don't know.
[02:17.51]But let's go.
[02:25.15]You guys ready?
[02:26.31]This song, by the way, has been stuck in my head since I was sitting here.
[02:31.73]Listen to the, ready for this song?
[02:33.43]Not the one, I mean, this one's a, this is a banger too, but hold on, listen to this one.
[02:36.37]This one has just been burning in my brain for a full, I want to say 20, 30 minutes of hanging out and getting ready.
[02:45.30]You guys ready to hear this?
[02:56.20]This is what I've been setting up to.
[02:57.40]This thing's great.
[03:02.89]It's great.
[03:13.57]I can't.
[03:14.87]Yeah, this is the game that Poke mentioned.
[03:16.14]Yeah.
[03:21.97]I gotta like DM poke and be like, hey, I gotta give him a review after this.
[03:26.17]I will give him a full review.
[03:29.77]That full review is going to be one sentence, but... Alright, you guys ready?
[03:34.62]Let's just play.
[03:35.12]Let's hang out.
[03:37.94]Make it louder, louder, louder, louder.
[03:41.80]Um, it's alright.
[03:43.20]It's good enough right here.
[03:44.04]I don't know how loud the rest of the game is, so not yet.
[03:46.05]Alright, bouncing duck simulator.
[03:48.95]Start.
[03:49.77]New game.
[03:57.63]Ster would hate this game.
[04:02.21]Oh, that's right, yes.
[04:02.97]Ster would hate this.
[04:08.99]Alright, so we woke up.
[04:10.21]We're in a room.
[04:11.89]Okay, this mouse sensitivity is very high.
[04:17.12]Hold on.
[04:20.80]Give me one sec.
[04:21.86]How do I turn the mouse sensitivity down?
[04:23.30]Okay, wait.
[04:25.98]Can I do it through here?
[04:30.34]How do I change the DPI of my mouse?
[04:32.96]Does anybody know?
[04:37.50]How do I affect the DPI?
[04:39.96]Of my mouse?
[04:45.64]You're a grown-ass man.
[04:46.83]Yeah!
[04:49.49]Wait, do I have to open up my, like, Razer program?
[04:53.75]Okay, Razer.
[04:56.53]This is the thing that I force quit every single time it opens.
[04:59.47]But I'm opening it for real now.
[05:03.77]Okay, here it is.
[05:05.03]Okay.
[05:06.99]Uh... How do I... Performance.
[05:11.50]Okay, sensitivity.
[05:12.58]The number of dots per inch.
[05:14.80]It's currently at... I'm gonna put it at 800.
[05:17.18]See if that helps.
[05:20.68]Holy shit, this sucks.
[05:22.96]How's it in here, though?
[05:26.79]Ooh, that's actually much better.
[05:28.53]It has to be even lower.
[05:29.33]Hold on.
[05:33.21]Even lower.
[05:33.75]Like one... Like 600 probably.
[05:38.06]Oh my god, this is awful.
[05:42.26]Alright, there we go.
[05:43.12]I think that's okay.
[05:44.72]I might have to lower it a little more later.
[05:45.96]Why is this off?
[05:47.42]Okay.
[05:54.27]Okay.
[05:56.00]That's much better.
[05:57.04]Like, a million times better.
[05:58.50]Okay, 13, 5, 6.
[05:58.78]What does this mean?
[05:59.94]Zero.
[06:00.48]What's that?
[06:03.18]Okay, that's turning music on and off.
[06:04.63]I mean, we're going to keep the music on.
[06:10.31]Is there a sprint?
[06:16.34]What do I get by... What do I get a duck?
[06:23.50]Oh, wait.
[06:23.92]We're here.
[06:27.21]Poke is worried that you're gonna hate this and be mad at him.
[06:33.22]That was- okay, this is loud.
[06:34.52]I'm- I'm turning it down.
[06:36.04]Oh, Poke- Poke, our friendship relies on me enjoying this game.
[06:42.83]Uh-oh.
[06:46.51]He's nervous.
[06:47.63]I'm gonna love it.
[06:48.81]It's a game where you- you don't have to play.
[06:51.99]I love these kind of games.
[06:54.84]Hoke, one of my favorite games of all time is a game where you clean houses and hit walls with a fucking sledgehammer.
[07:01.82]It's going to be fine.
[07:07.40]I just got 10 bounces.
[07:08.18]That's got to be a record.
[07:12.63]Okay, so a whole left click and then left go to throw it.
[07:15.61]Okay, what does right click do?
[07:23.56]I'm gonna do the thing.
[07:24.18]I'm gonna take my bouncy ball.
[07:26.06]I'm gonna run, sprint.
[07:28.58]Hop, hop, hop, jump, throw it at the ground as hard as I can.
[07:33.42]Didn't really work.
[07:37.56]Can I spawn more than one?
[07:43.15]No.
[07:43.33]I only have 27 bounces.
[07:45.35]How do I get more?
[07:46.13]Into the corner.
[07:55.68]If I get to 100, I bet it changes.
[08:08.93]I kind of feel like a dog right now, but that's alright.
[08:18.22]What happens when I get to 100?
[08:26.53]99.
[08:26.57]Alright, this is it.
[08:27.87]100.
[08:27.89]I just got it.
[08:33.09]Oh, shit.
[08:33.49]Alright, so now I can press this button.
[08:39.45]I have two... I have two ducks in here now?
[08:41.71]What is this?
[08:45.45]Health?
[08:47.17]What do I do with that?
[08:55.73]Can I feed it to the duck or something?
[09:00.65]Whoa.
[09:01.27]Okay, it's bigger.
[09:01.93]Does this count for more bounces?
[09:09.02]It was a battery.
[09:09.80]Alright.
[09:10.00]Well, alright.
[09:10.40]I get it.
[09:10.68]I get it.
[09:10.86]I get it.
[09:11.12]I know.
[09:11.36]I get the game now.
[09:17.86]Poke, don't ever call me ever again.
[09:19.46]I'm just kidding.
[09:29.51]I think I actually am gonna really like this.
[09:31.61]I get it.
[09:34.35]I get what's going on right now.
[09:35.73]I'm into this.
[09:41.71]I gotta get to two, what, 500?
[09:42.67]I think going in the corner.
[09:50.56]Corner, we'll get at least three or four, right?
[09:52.48]If we stuff it in here and get it glitched.
[09:57.85]That's a good strategy.
[09:58.51]500.
[09:58.85]I'm going for 500.
[10:04.80]Shit.
[10:05.06]Whoa.
[10:05.60]I got more.
[10:09.48]Can I pick up more than one?
[10:10.32]These things are worth two.
[10:16.11]Watch this.
[10:16.43]Can I pick up more than one?
[10:27.59]Okay.
[10:29.05]I love how this game was recommended for me.
[10:32.07]Hey man, I got a great game that I think you'll really like.
[10:35.77]Oh, what is it?
[10:37.09]Baldur's Gate 3.
[10:38.73]Strategy.
[10:40.11]RPG elements.
[10:41.79]There's a lot of decision making.
[10:44.21]Not that one.
[10:45.77]Armored Core 6.
[10:47.05]Action oriented.
[10:48.43]Tons of difficult boss encounters and tons of upgrades to put on your character and make a mech that you can fight with.
[10:55.31]Not that one either.
[10:57.10]Dude, I think you'd be a huge fan of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
[11:00.42]You can explore a vast, incredibly large open world and create any... No, not that one either.
[11:07.01]I like that one of you play with toys.
[11:11.87]Now that one, that's the one for you.
[11:19.80]I'm just chasing around dog toys.
[11:25.04]Is this what Otto feels like?
[11:31.25]He's got auto brain.
[11:33.37]Oh, I got another one.
[11:34.23]Oh, look, another thing to press.
[11:38.29]Yes.
[11:39.73]What is it?
[11:40.05]Alright.
[11:42.26]This is a big deal.
[11:44.10]Do I give the battery to the pink one or to the yellow one?
[11:54.06]Should we keep them the same size or?
[11:59.46]I'm going for that.
[12:01.32]To me, that was the right call.
[12:04.76]Alright, what about like... Wait, I can't pick it up anymore.
[12:09.44]Why can I not pick it up?
[12:13.56]How much is it... Wait, I can't pick it up?
[12:14.88]Uh-oh.
[12:22.69]That's worth 10 now, I think.
[12:24.87]Alright, I got it.
[12:26.91]Just keep throwing shit at it.
[12:34.72]You've ruined it.
[12:35.34]You need to restart.
[12:36.00]No, I'm good.
[12:38.08]I'll be okay.
[12:45.93]Nice.
[12:46.73]Okay, 1,000.
[12:52.93]That one's different.
[12:53.53]Okay, this one is permanently bouncing.
[12:57.11]We're going to have to... Okay, when we get the next level up, we're giving it to that one.
[13:04.38]Also, by the way, I do apologize for anybody that does have a dog in the room and you're listening to this with a speaker.
[13:10.44]I'm... Honestly, there's not much I can do about it.
[13:14.02]It's either that or turn off the volume.
[13:18.13]But I'm probably making a lot of your dog's head tilt at your computer right now.
[13:24.23]And for that, I apologize.
[13:28.50]Alright, we got more.
[13:29.42]Almost at 1,500. 1,500?
[13:33.12]This one's like glass?
[13:35.14]What is this one?
[13:37.80]Can I break this one?
[13:38.58]I'm scared to break it.
[13:41.45]Is this worth a hundred?
[13:42.41]How much is that worth?
[13:45.27]Okay, dude.
[13:46.39]Oh.
[13:46.63]Uh oh.
[13:53.96]I don't know if I did that wrong, but whatever.
[13:58.73]Alright, we have to focus on balancing the big one with the little one.
[14:02.46]That one's just a permanent stat increases, so.
[14:05.34]I'm going to play this for at least a couple hours.
[14:08.76]That's what's happening today.
[14:14.25]Ow!
[14:19.83]Is this a pre-recorded stream?
[14:21.35]No.
[14:23.71]Wait, I can press the button.
[14:28.09]Alright, alright, alright.
[14:28.85]This is really important.
[14:30.59]I'm going to give this to you because I want you to get... That's the right call, right?
[14:38.04]Min-maxing this, you would give them all to this eventually.
[14:40.78]Alright, here we go.
[14:43.60]What's that giving me?
[14:46.50]That's 20 each one.
[14:48.24]Alright, keep that one moving.
[14:49.60]Can I trap that in a corner or something?
[15:02.26]He's going to play this for 52 hours.
[15:04.76]Not that long.
[15:07.62]I do want to get to at least a million bounces.
[15:10.47]Is that going to take a long time?
[15:14.17]Is that going to take more than two hours?
[15:21.24]More.
[15:22.38]More!
[15:25.78]Okay, that one, this one's metal?
[15:27.08]I wonder if this one breaks.
[15:31.41]Is that worth anything?
[15:39.94]I can't tell.
[15:40.34]That's not very much.
[15:41.16]I guess it moves more?
[15:45.96]Heavier?
[15:47.75]Heavier?
[15:59.39]Nice.
[15:59.57]I'm definitely going to get to a million.
[16:04.35]Easy.
[16:08.23]I have so much training playing any video game on the iPad.
[16:11.50]I'm going to be really good at this.
[16:13.78]It kind of sounds like they're like yelling at each other or something.
[16:33.33]He's an iPad, baby.
[16:34.79]I'm already at 10,000.
[16:35.49]You don't think I'm going to get to a million?
[16:37.17]Alright.
[16:42.74]What do I up?
[16:43.28]I'm going to upgrade this one again.
[16:45.06]It's just too consistent.
[16:46.22]I think the game just corrupt.
[16:54.38]Is that going to keep?
[17:00.92]Is that going to keep going the whole time?
[17:06.68]That's not going to stay there the whole time, right?
[17:08.48]Because I don't think I can sit in this room for more than an hour listening to this on loop.
[17:28.13]Well, this one's magical.
[17:31.05]What if I do this?
[17:32.39]Shit.
[17:41.12]Alright.
[17:43.00]I'm going to have to put my own music on.
[17:46.27]I'm going to have to put my own music on.
[17:48.03]Alright, at what point have I won listening to this?
[17:51.29]Does anybody want to tell me?
[17:52.41]At what point have I won?
[17:53.31]30 minutes?
[17:59.84]What if I just do it again?
[18:05.04]Get over here.
[18:14.73]Over here.
[18:25.98]You're doing what every cartoon character in every single piece of media does when they have sugar.
[18:31.42]I don't think I can pick it up.
[18:46.00]Alright, where's the... Where is it?
[18:54.02]No, I lost it.
[18:56.16]Oh my god.
[19:10.71]Shit.
[19:12.35]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[19:13.61]I have to just deal with it.
[19:16.45]I'm giving it to this one.
[19:30.02]If I knew that was going to do non-stop Nyan Cat, we would not be in this scenario right now.
[19:35.69]But here we are.
[19:50.31]50k is going to give me something good probably, right?
[19:54.15]Should I break this?
[20:01.94]Alright, 50k.
[20:07.36]What's this one?
[20:07.90]This one's just a regular one.
[20:10.00]It's a blue one?
[20:18.07]Yeah.
[20:19.88]This thing is somehow not hitting anything in the room.
[20:25.94]What is this giving for points?
[20:27.32]Like 80?
[20:27.50]Alright, we got to actually start to use skill here.
[20:33.01]This feels like an experiment.
[20:39.01]100k is going to get something good, right?
[20:49.09]What's Poke's high score?
[20:54.49]Actually, wait.
[20:54.81]Don't tell me.
[20:55.17]Don't tell me.
[20:55.51]Don't tell me.
[20:55.85]Nobody tell me.
[20:56.57]Nobody tell me.
[20:57.53]Clear chat.
[20:58.05]Mods, clear chat.
[20:58.79]Mods, clear chat.
[20:59.91]Mods, clear chat.
[21:01.57]Mods, clear chat.
[21:02.89]Nobody tell me.
[21:06.43]I have to beat Poke's score, whatever it is.
[21:21.74]72.
[21:21.78]I gotta get to 100k.
[21:30.71]I have to turn this off at some point.
[21:33.15]I personally can't take this.
[21:36.77]I personally don't think I can take this.
[21:39.33]Not the game, this song.
[21:42.51]Look, it's a classic, classic song.
[21:46.00]Wait.
[21:46.10]Wait.
[21:53.18]That's another power-up.
[21:54.62]Alright, can I please feed it to you?
[21:56.34]So you turn into something else.
[21:58.68]Come here, come here, come here!
[22:12.39]I'm just gonna stay still.
[22:13.17]It'll hit me eventually.
[22:20.55]It's giving a lot of points, though.
[22:22.54]Right here.
[22:40.55]I can't track it.
[22:44.15]Just give it to the crystal?
[22:46.57]Oh, I can't.
[22:50.07]Who should I give it to?
[22:52.89]Is this it fully upgraded?
[22:53.80]What about the king?
[22:55.64]No.
[22:55.80]What about blue?
[23:01.90]No?
[23:02.68]Who can I give this to?
[23:07.46]Whoa!
[23:09.72]Somebody should throw pink... Oh.
[23:10.82]Did I just make one?
[23:12.90]Hold on a second.
[23:13.74]I just made... Oh, dear God.
[23:19.34]Oh, dear God.
[23:29.25]Uh, where's... Wait.
[23:36.47]I need both of you over here in the corner.
[23:38.61]No shit.
[23:39.33]Come here.
[23:42.38]Can I crouch?
[23:47.18]100,000 bounces.
[23:47.84]Let's go.
[23:48.14]Okay.
[23:53.60]How much is this one worth?
[23:54.94]That's a lot, I think.
[24:02.25]This... Ah!
[24:03.95]It's a bomb.
[24:04.39]It's a bomb.
[24:04.81]It's a bomb.
[24:05.23]It's a bomb.
[24:05.55]It's a bomb.
[24:05.87]It's a bomb.
[24:06.67]Just leave it over there.
[24:13.07]that off so bad.
[24:23.01]How do I upgrade?
[24:25.06]Who wants to upgrade?
[24:26.20]What about you?
[24:32.86]Get over here.
[24:35.14]Why can't I upgrade anybody?
[24:36.14]Oh shit, that turned gold.
[24:53.09]Should I blow one of these up?
[24:55.57]I'm afraid of this.
[24:56.15]Alright, we need to make more.
[25:05.99]This is so loud.
[25:17.96]I'm so glad I turned it down.
[25:23.04]I think it's all about making, um... I think, honestly, I think it's all about putting on the Plock OST in five minutes.
[25:29.46]You know what I mean?
[25:40.06]I'm into this, though.
[25:41.26]I'm definitely into, uh... I want to keep this going.
[25:44.22]I got to get to a million.
[25:47.29]If you're going to open this game, you'd better get to a million points.
[25:51.11]Otherwise, why did you open it?
[25:53.29]Why did you open the game, right?
[25:55.03]I think that's fair.
[26:02.67]Each one of these bounces from the baby is given at least one.
[26:13.84]He's in the way.
[26:14.34]Let me move him.
[26:27.56]I hate when it flies by my head.
[26:28.92]It's like somebody's zooming by me.
[26:31.82]It's like when a fly flies right next to your head, and it's in full stride, and you get that by your head.
[26:40.87]Oh, imagine if they played Nyan Cat.
[26:46.15]Another one of these.
[26:46.77]150 probably is a milestone somehow.
[27:03.97]I talk about like YouTube shorts.
[27:05.84]Oh yeah, I checked out YouTube shorts the other day and I wasn't a fan.
[27:10.18]And this is what I'm exposing all of you to.
[27:16.81]There's a little bit of hypocrisy there.
[27:40.17]I'm just gonna focus on this.
[27:59.02]Folk said, dude, he just disappeared from my friends list.
[28:09.83]Just like, why is he not online anymore?
[28:12.37]What happened?
[28:13.78]Is he appearing offline?
[28:14.72]What happened?
[28:23.46]Now, if anything, Poke, this strengthened our friendship.
[28:26.53]I just want to make sure you understand that.
[28:32.65]This strengthened our bond.
[28:38.67]What's the goal?
[28:42.09]Well, that's simple.
[28:44.85]Number on right side of screen goes up.
[28:48.21]That's it.
[28:49.53]I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory, I think.
[29:08.08]Number on screen go up.
[29:11.30]I like.
[29:20.04]Oh, will we- will we- will- I can't fucking do it.
[29:24.84]Will we reach 500,000 subs today, guys?
[29:29.50]I don't know.
[29:30.14]I have a feeling it's possible.
[29:34.47]Will we cross 200,000 subs tonight?
[29:43.47]What would I have had to have done to get this many subs immediately?
[29:50.35]What would be causing this amount of people to sub to a channel?
[29:54.87]This fast.
[29:56.27]What would it take?
[30:00.06]This is what happens if I shove the baseball up my ass, somebody said.
[30:14.58]I am not shoving a baseball up my ass until we hit a million subs, right?
[30:19.99]Let's just sit here.
[30:21.29]Just what?
[30:21.75]Just holding it?
[30:22.37]I feel like it would be going down.
[30:33.12]This would be going down.
[30:34.66]This would not be going up.
[30:36.80]This would be going down.
[30:45.84]No, this is very... Hey, hey, hey, everybody in chat, quiet for a second.
[30:50.38]We're talking about a comedic, jokey thing.
[30:53.54]This is not a real thing.
[30:54.78]We're just talking about a jokey thing.
[30:56.47]This is me pretending.
[30:58.51]Please, for the love of God, stop it.
[31:01.59]Stop.
[31:01.91]We already crossed a million followers on the channel like a year ago.
[31:05.13]So, excuse me.
[31:06.37]Alright, we'll check back in on that later.
[31:21.23]Alright, what's the next one?
[31:23.11]Ooh.
[31:23.85]What are we going to upgrade?
[31:25.55]What can I upgrade?
[31:32.95]The bomb?
[31:39.88]I don't think you can upgrade some of them.
[31:42.20]Some of them just cannot be upgraded.
[31:44.68]What about one of the little babies?
[31:45.60]Oh.
[31:58.18]I gotta get my stumps up.
[32:05.92]Oh, I farted.
[32:09.77]It's working, it's working.
[32:21.84]Nothing gonna go down.
[32:27.38]Alright, alright.
[32:28.70]I have to turn this fucking audio off.
[32:30.10]Is it going to explode?
[32:47.36]Honestly, that sounds like a video that would be made in 2023, right?
[32:53.36]On the wall here, I have my sub count.
[32:56.24]I have to be in this room until my subs go over a million.
[33:01.36]I cannot leave the room until it crosses that threshold.
[33:04.18]I need more of these.
[33:16.99]Look at this like stuff.
[33:17.65]Look at this.
[33:17.93]There's something here.
[33:18.88]There's something on this wall too.
[33:19.92]Look.
[33:21.22]See this?
[33:22.54]There's like panels.
[33:23.36]I'll probably get to open them.
[33:24.80]I bet.
[33:27.63]Alright, where's that 250?
[33:28.45]What happens at 250?
[33:31.93]Maybe smash him with the metal duck?
[33:33.77]Okay.
[33:35.13]I mean, that very clearly... It probably... Maybe you upgrade it and it opens to like another button to press?
[33:40.87]Alright, where is... Where is the metal duck?
[33:45.41]Over here.
[33:49.38]That was a... It's so loud.
[33:51.84]So you say smash this against the wall.
[33:56.45]It worked, it worked, it worked, it worked.
[33:57.61]Alright, alright, alright.
[33:58.37]I got something.
[33:58.87]What is this?
[33:59.37]X marks that.
[34:01.15]Alright, what about over here?
[34:05.24]Ooh.
[34:08.96]What's that?
[34:18.73]Yeah, I knew you could open those.
[34:20.47]Is there any more of those?
[34:27.67]This has got to be.
[34:28.15]Wait.
[34:28.71]Bomb.
[34:29.31]Bomb.
[34:29.53]Bomb.
[34:29.71]Bomb.
[34:32.73]Why is this a skeleton?
[34:33.45]I'm going to throw the bomb at this.
[34:36.37]This is absolutely what you have to do.
[34:37.38]Is there one on the roof?
[34:43.10]Oh, there is one right there.
[34:43.86]I don't think I can make that, though.
[34:48.38]Maybe with the... I don't think... I have to, like, get higher.
[34:50.46]Alright.
[34:53.44]Two... We crossed 250.
[34:54.70]No button to press.
[35:08.39]Can I actually upgrade the... This thing still?
[35:11.81]The Nyan one?
[35:15.41]Or will you guys... Upgrade the skeleton?
[35:18.99]Ooh.
[35:19.81]Can I?
[35:21.43]Whoa!
[35:22.13]It worked.
[35:23.23]What does that do?
[35:23.73]It has a face.
[35:26.51]Is it worth anything?
[35:28.31]I can't tell.
[35:33.95]Okay, that's cool.
[35:37.73]We got to keep these things moving.
[35:38.65]If you see one on the ground that's not moving, we have to make it move.
[35:47.46]There we go.
[35:48.00]That's much faster.
[35:48.68]Something broke.
[35:51.20]Whoa.
[35:51.38]What?
[35:51.66]What was that?
[35:54.36]Oh, look at this.
[35:56.32]One of the big ones broke into little ones that are giving me more.
[36:03.90]I think when they break, they give you money.
[36:05.60]But whatever it is.
[36:06.67]Subscribers.
[36:07.37]Oh, whatever.
[36:08.31]Who cares?
[36:08.75]Nice.
[36:16.46]Yeah, alright.
[36:18.10]Bomb on X. Bomb on X. I can't get it to blow up.
[36:20.40]Do I need a fire duck?
[36:22.26]That would make sense.
[36:36.84]You know, if there was a statistic to tell how many people muted the stream, put it on the other monitor, and are doing something else on their other monitor, I think I might have broken the record for this channel.
[36:47.69]Right now.
[36:56.44]Oh!
[36:57.24]Pixel duck!
[37:10.98]Dude, that's every stream.
[37:14.80]You're so funny.
[37:15.78]Alright, we have to blow this wall up with the bomb, but I don't think... We gotta move the big one around more.
[37:34.16]It's worth so much more.
[37:43.19]Where'd it go?
[37:45.85]There we go, look at that, 300k already.
[38:06.47]What is it worth?
[38:08.15]It's hard to tell.
[38:16.58]Alright, everybody minimize the screen for a second.
[38:24.46]Okay, minimize the screen.
[38:27.20]Just don't watch for a second.
[38:28.85]I'm warning you.
[38:29.47]Here we go.
[38:30.15]3, 2, 1.
[38:31.69]It's going to get wild on the screen.
[38:33.95]Are you ready?
[38:34.73]3, 2, 1.
[38:38.31]That actually might be a good strategy.
[38:53.11]I think we just need to do more of this.
[38:57.97]No, I don't want more than 340,000 subs.
[38:59.51]It's going to crash my computer.
[39:01.46]I need to break this.
[39:04.96]Very clearly.
[39:05.62]The last one broke and gave us a lot.
[39:21.41]Throw gold at glass duck.
[39:23.97]I was going to try that after.
[39:24.79]Oh, it's going to work.
[39:34.22]I can hear it.
[39:52.68]okay um alright once we get to half a million I will put on whatever uh mods just hey mods it's hard for me to talk to take to think and talk um can can one of you alright hold on I need to take my headphones up uh can somebody put a poll up of four fun osts to listen to
[40:19.84]And just check and vote on it.
[40:21.82]Mods can determine what they are.
[40:23.38]We're looking for video game OSTs.
[40:24.76]Something good.
[40:28.52]Okay, now I cannot talk anymore.
[40:29.90]I can't think anymore because my headphones are in.
[40:35.26]Can you mute the music?
[40:36.18]I wonder.
[40:36.50]Progress will be saved.
[40:40.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[40:44.35]Hold on.
[40:44.61]Can I mute the music?
[40:47.09]I can't.
[40:49.76]What duck decks?
[40:52.38]Oh, it tells you what you found.
[40:53.46]I'm waking up in the corner of the room.
[41:07.47]No, I don't.
[41:08.81]No, no, I don't.
[41:10.45]I don't.
[41:11.77]I don't care about how many subs I have.
[41:14.55]Why did I do this?
[41:18.42]Why do I give a shit about this?
[41:19.91]I could just be doing anything.
[41:20.99]I could be relaxing on the couch right now.
[41:23.19]I don't care about how many subs come in.
[41:28.17]It's too much.
[41:28.91]It's too much.
[41:29.49]Too many subs.
[41:34.58]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[41:35.58]Welcome back to the video.
[41:36.48]It's me checking out that sub counter.
[41:40.84]As we see here, it's at 400,000 subs.
[41:41.86]Getting there.
[41:47.68]I'd like to see that hit a million.
[41:56.81]Jerry.
[41:58.99]I want to see it at a million subs, Jerry.
[42:06.82]That's never going to happen.
[42:07.72]We are absolutely going to get to a million.
[42:09.30]There's no way we are not.
[42:18.12]Alright, what do we got for, uh... What do we got for, uh, OST voting?
[42:22.88]Blow up the wall?
[42:23.64]I don't know how.
[42:24.14]I was thinking about this.
[42:26.06]Yeah, I was trying to.
[42:26.78]I need to light the fuse.
[42:29.80]See?
[42:30.62]There's a fuse I need to light.
[42:32.46]I was holding that.
[42:40.55]Wait, these are closed again.
[42:53.49]blow up in my face.
[42:54.67]It's gonna blow up in my face and be extremely loud.
[43:01.27]I don't think so.
[43:03.35]I like that one.
[43:30.73]bullet going by my face.
[43:32.69]I don't like that.
[43:45.00]Wait, hold on.
[43:45.68]Can I... Alright, pick an OST.
[43:54.56]The mods have decided on a few.
[43:57.34]Get us in something.
[43:59.42]We'll just chill and play the game.
[44:11.93]I haven't seen an upgrade in a while.
[44:13.03]These are not generating any points.
[44:24.94]They have to be increased.
[44:30.56]What's the diamond?
[44:31.32]Uh, diamond.
[44:34.24]Is it diamond?
[44:42.25]I don't think I can reach anything up there yet.
[44:46.33]I can't throw the metal one that high.
[44:47.39]I can't throw the bomb that high either.
[44:50.15]Maybe the bone?
[44:50.77]No, I don't think I have enough power to throw.
[45:02.08]Maybe this one?
[45:04.12]Oh, I actually might hit it with that one.
[45:05.28]Hold on.
[45:10.30]Shit.
[45:15.51]Damn it.
[45:17.97]Congratulations, everybody.
[45:19.11]Plok has won.
[45:21.57]Give me one sec while I turn this down.
[45:33.85]Okay.
[45:35.23]Alright.
[45:35.59]I feel like my soul just re-entered my body.
[45:41.77]Alright, let's put on Plok.
[45:43.89]Plok OST.
[45:44.83]We listen to this all the time, but it's a good one.
[45:58.50]Alright.
[46:00.00]Yeah, now everybody can relax.
[46:11.44]Now we got a vibe going.
[46:12.34]There we go.
[46:15.72]I'm missing the quacks, but it's fine.
[46:26.80]Turn it up a little louder.
[46:27.51]Got it.
[46:31.73]That's as loud as I'm willing to go.
[46:32.73]Alright, almost at half a million.
[46:38.05]Oh shit, I just turned the stream off.
[46:48.24]I can jam to this and just play.
[46:50.12]I'm into that.
[46:53.94]Alright, here we go.
[46:54.64]We're at half a million.
[46:56.61]Yes!
[47:03.89]Alright, this is an upgrade.
[47:04.75]This one's really important because I don't know who to give this to.
[47:15.57]I think that... Can I give it to anybody besides the skeleton?
[47:18.20]What about the metal one?
[47:19.68]Bomb?
[47:27.66]I don't think I can give it to Bomb.
[47:29.28]Alright, here we go.
[47:31.84]Alright.
[47:32.16]Uh, this one, what did it do?
[47:34.50]Did it give it a pixel duck?
[47:41.22]Oh, shit.
[47:51.50]We're at 515.
[47:52.82]It's going a lot faster.
[47:53.78]Alright, I'm gonna focus.
[47:59.21]I need to start... Look at this.
[48:01.07]Look at how terrible I'm doing.
[48:02.39]Look at all the ducks that are on the ground that are not bouncing.
[48:09.88]What am I... Am I even playing the game?
[48:18.78]I need to be moving this one a lot.
[48:22.32]Yep, there we go.
[48:23.74]Look at that number climb.
[48:29.08]I need to like whack it.
[48:35.72]This does feel like a YouTube short now.
[48:37.62]600, what happens at a million?
[48:51.79]I missed the quacks.
[48:53.87]I missed the quacks too, but removing the quacks also removed for the next three hours straight.
[49:05.24]So, it's a sacrifice we had to make.
[49:14.21]I gotta move, the big one has the most points, so we just have to use the metal one, just continuously move the big one.
[49:22.10]Just play quacking sounds in the background.
[49:26.42]No, no.
[49:27.72]No, I need a break.
[49:28.72]I need a break.
[49:29.16]I've been playing this for like 40 minutes.
[49:30.58]I need a quick break from all that.
[49:33.66]Let me just listen to Pluck and throw things into walls and talk.
[49:36.77]Just for a little bit.
[49:38.81]We need a break.
[49:41.77]Everything's gonna be alright.
[49:56.87]There's a speaker box.
[49:58.51]Yeah, this is the speaker box.
[49:59.79]Unfortunately, it only turns off the music coming out of this.
[50:02.31]It does not turn off the Nyan Cat song.
[50:04.35]Alright, I think I'm just going to go with some growth.
[50:09.94]I think growth makes sense here.
[50:24.97]I'm going to focus on growth for the next 10 straight minutes.
[50:27.83]Alright?
[50:31.67]So, if I do anything besides focus on growth, I would like for you all to yell at me because that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
[50:38.99]So, at one hour streamed exactly is when I'm going to stop focusing on growth.
[50:50.62]And then we'll focus on something else for a little bit.
[51:02.20]If I see one, I'm gonna bounce one.
[51:07.12]How did I miss that close?
[51:09.90]Where?
[51:10.12]Alright, what's the next one?
[51:20.42]It actually is a little too soft.
[51:21.52]Let's put it up a little louder.
[51:32.89]that's a little meatier that's meatier we don't want it too meaty but I'll be able to hear it still hear it alright growth growth yeah I know I gotta get it
[52:04.50]I love the Super Nintendo trumpet sound.
[52:07.44]Or like, what is it, tuba?
[52:22.85]Alright, seven more minutes of this.
[52:25.95]And then... I'll be probably close to a million.
[52:44.20]600,000.
[52:44.92]Stay in the corner.
[52:53.01]This is perfect.
[53:00.51]I wish these would just automatically jump around.
[53:02.07]I need more of those Nyan Cat ones.
[53:19.92]Somebody just said, I don't understand.
[53:22.12]Honestly, I think you do.
[53:31.19]I think you're just afraid to admit out loud that this is what I'm doing today.
[53:36.41]So it's like, no, he's not doing this, right?
[53:42.76]But I'm into it.
[53:43.84]So that's what we're doing.
[53:46.78]You wouldn't get it.
[53:47.72]I mean, there is not very much to get right now.
[53:54.90]But there's such little to get right now that I do understand the, like, what am I looking at here?
[53:59.88]I get it.
[54:19.45]OK, we have five more minutes of this.
[54:21.91]Five more minutes of growth and we'll be good.
[54:23.09]Alright, get moving over here.
[54:36.48]What is going on with this corner?
[54:37.66]Get moving.
[54:58.22]Boss fight, right?
[55:06.69]Shit.
[55:09.45]Shit.
[55:09.69]It's actually going to get hard to pick up the ducks on the ground.
[55:21.46]Oh, this is the one that I did that dance to that I keep seeing the same dance.
[55:27.02]Point, point, point, point, point, point.
[55:30.04]Oh, you know the one.
[55:34.39]Okay.
[55:54.88]Uh, three more minutes.
[55:57.00]We'll be at 700.
[55:57.54]And then after that.
[56:00.99]We're going to bounce around the big King duck.
[56:08.23]And hopefully get to a million pretty quickly.
[56:27.71]Green light?
[56:28.17]Ooh!
[56:28.91]Okay, it's 700k, it's in green light.
[56:30.53]What we got?
[56:35.99]Oh my goodness.
[56:42.43]We're still focusing on growth.
[56:44.79]So...
[57:07.50]Actually starting to get hard to move around.
[57:08.74]A million was going to be easy.
[57:21.27]I really underestimated how easy that was going to be to get there.
[57:25.65]I mean, actually, it's an hour.
[57:26.63]You have to dedicate at least 30 to 40 minutes to doing this.
[57:31.89]I'm into it though, I'm here.
[57:45.81]Oh wait, bitrate, bitrate, bitrate, bitrate.
[57:48.79]Oh no.
[57:49.39]Is this going to be a bitrate stream?
[57:56.42]How bad is it?
[57:59.28]It's not that bad.
[58:00.08]Okay, it's actually fine.
[58:01.32]Okay, okay, okay.
[58:14.13]It's fine.
[58:15.55]I wonder how bad it'll get.
[58:16.45]Like Vampire Survivors.
[58:22.75]I got one more minute of growth.
[58:25.17]And then I'm going to focus on just trying to get points with the big one and the metal.
[58:43.10]Alright, we're pretty much done with growth.
[58:45.10]800,000.
[58:52.08]That electric guitar.
[59:06.66]Why is it darker?
[59:08.64]Oh, one of the lights is out.
[59:10.68]Hold on, did I do that?
[59:11.86]I think I knocked a light out.
[59:12.98]Alright, it's time to focus on a million.
[59:30.19]Let's make sure everything on the ground is moving.
[59:39.34]Pretty much.
[59:39.92]Alright.
[59:44.34]Whoa!
[59:45.13]That had a... I broke the radio.
[59:48.95]Oh, shit.
[59:49.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[59:50.01]What do I give this to?
[59:54.77]Who should eat that?
[60:00.16]Pixel?
[60:00.40]Alright.
[60:01.46]Where's Pixel Duck?
[60:04.48]Over here.
[60:08.28]Oh!
[60:10.26]Is it... Is it gonna be... What's this worth now?
[60:16.22]I like the rainbow.
[60:18.12]Alright, um... Is it gonna do... Is it gonna bounce around like the Nyan Cat or no?
[60:22.26]It's just worth a lot?
[60:29.90]It's probably worth a lot.
[60:30.64]Alright, focus on hitting big one.
[60:42.52]throw the bomb up.
[60:44.08]Yeah, I can't reach that far.
[60:49.57]The roof is still not broken.
[60:50.79]Yeah, I can't reach this far, though.
[60:52.99]Skeleton?
[60:54.71]Can the bone do it?
[61:13.87]Wait, is that?
[61:15.96]That's not a fire, is it?
[61:17.42]That's not like a candle light.
[61:18.90]Is that a candle?
[61:23.38]Wait, this thing's smoking now.
[61:26.71]Does this count as a fire?
[61:34.15]That might count as a fire.
[61:51.10]Wait, maybe I can throw this to the roof.
[61:55.91]I might be able to make it to the roof with that.
[62:02.01]Ah, oh shit, I almost had it.
[62:03.47]Damn it.
[62:15.42]That's hitting it.
[62:15.94]Oh.
[62:22.34]Somebody said, maybe I can do this.
[62:23.72]Let's place this and maybe throw something heavy at it and smush it.
[62:28.69]I don't think that's going to work.
[62:44.06]That's a couple of good direct hits.
[62:46.26]Break the other lights.
[62:47.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:50.82]This is important.
[62:52.66]I'm almost at a million subs.
[62:55.06]Get out of my way, this is MY moment!
[62:59.78]Almost at a million subs, guys.
[63:18.60]I was here.
[63:24.78]Need to unmute for this?
[63:28.37]Did I unmute?
[63:40.12]No, I'm gonna miss it!
[63:40.74]I'm gonna miss it!
[63:44.74]No!
[63:44.88]I'm gonna actually miss it!
[63:57.28]One million subscribers!
[64:00.02]Something's happening now.
[64:07.21]Alright, we need to turn this off, this music off.
[64:13.69]What is going on right now?
[64:16.09]Turn the volume up.
[64:24.24]Did I just beat the game?
[64:32.63]I can't move.
[64:33.13]There's one.
[64:47.00]I can't move.
[64:49.96]I think I have to catch them.
[64:59.13]He's actually walking towards me.
[65:10.68]gonna do like a five minutes freddy's like if I'm just I'm warning you it probably will we're probably there right now you jump scare probably incoming what I didn't beat it the end the game just turned off
[65:44.49]No, that was the good ending.
[65:45.55]I said good ending.
[65:52.04]How do I get the bad ending?
[65:56.86]You had this open for 50 minutes before your stream.
[66:04.42]Yeah, because I was getting my stream ready.
[66:10.04]And it was just sitting on the menu because I was like, I had to get my stream ready.
[66:13.92]I had to have something to eat.
[66:14.88]I didn't want to just close everything.
[66:16.75]Alright, so how do I get the other endings?
[66:20.83]I need to open that thing up there.
[66:27.31]You need to... Okay, skeleton duck.
[66:29.45]But how do I open this thing?
[66:32.17]I need to blow up the wall too.
[66:33.23]Alright, blow the wall up.
[66:36.21]That's important.
[66:41.44]Okay, how do I do that?
[66:43.14]I need the bomb.
[66:45.76]There are multiple endings, apparently.
[66:47.70]I want to get at least a couple of them.
[66:53.85]Upgrade the skeleton all the way.
[66:54.87]I might have to do a new game for that, though.
[67:00.43]Alright, where's Bombduck?
[67:05.63]How do I light Bombduck?
[67:14.07]Break the radio on bomb duck.
[67:23.06]Sparks from the light.
[67:28.41]Yeah, let's break all the lights.
[67:29.47]How do I get more force?
[67:44.06]Do I have to do it with the gold one?
[67:50.32]Maybe I have to get some air.
[67:58.10]Stand on the box?
[68:07.95]Oh wait, I know what you mean.
[68:21.25]Damn it.
[68:25.94]Can you smash the screen?
[68:27.16]Smash the screen.
[68:28.36]Hold on.
[68:28.64]Wait, that might actually work.
[68:39.57]I broke it.
[68:39.95]What did that do?
[68:52.91]I want to open that.
[68:53.63]I want to open the ceiling panel.
[69:00.54]Wall panels might do it.
[69:01.72]That's a good idea.
[69:15.27]Stop knocking it out of my hand.
[69:23.91]Stop.
[69:31.70]This might be fire.
[69:32.52]It actually might be, but how did I break it before?
[69:34.48]Do I have to start over?
[69:42.66]Try to make a spark with the metal one on.
[69:44.24]Yeah, I tried that before.
[69:45.70]It didn't really work.
[69:50.67]Start over.
[69:51.07]Smash the radio with the metal.
[70:05.54]Oh, shit, shit.
[70:06.20]Okay, I got one, I got one.
[70:07.52]Now, who do I give this to?
[70:10.48]The bone?
[70:17.28]Oh, it's not there yet.
[70:21.30]Do I get any more?
[70:23.44]Do I get any more juice to give to the bone duck?
[70:30.68]Bomb?
[70:31.26]I can't give it to the bomb.
[70:32.92]The bomb doesn't take it.
[70:41.33]You might have to restart.
[70:43.33]I think you get one more.
[70:49.33]You have to smash the radio when it's off.
[71:05.05]You'd think this would work.
[71:14.05]Alright.
[71:15.59]I got one more for the bone.
[71:18.76]Ooh!
[71:19.46]Now what?
[71:20.28]What does this do now?
[71:30.51]Maybe I can break the panels now?
[71:37.91]I can't remove the panels with this.
[71:42.47]It's just really cool looking.
[71:44.62]Smash the radio more.
[71:45.44]I feel like a caveman.
[72:10.61]I don't think so.
[72:21.22]I gotta get that panel off.
[72:23.76]Maybe I shouldn't have upgraded the duck.
[72:26.31]I think I... Alright, hear me out on this.
[72:30.53]I might have to start over to get the small duck to break the lights and break the panel off the ceiling.
[72:39.90]You know what I mean?
[72:42.08]Metal duck will create Sparks.
[72:47.27]I can't get it.
[72:52.49]God help us.
[72:59.19]Use the angel for the ceiling.
[73:01.86]Does it have enough weight?
[73:12.72]I'm not sure this has enough weight.
[73:18.73]Break the angel, maybe?
[73:21.05]That's not a bad idea.
[73:28.39]Oh, that was a direct hit.
[73:32.04]That was a direct hit.
[73:32.80]Smash the button.
[73:35.34]Good idea.
[73:51.41]Smash that like button press it a hundred times Oh What just came out what was that I heard something come out What is that it's like a
[74:21.78]potato like a baked potato oh wood this is wood wood makes fire fire makes electricity electricity makes currents currents allows for a bomb to be lit okay here we go come on I need a spark
[74:59.77]This has to work.
[75:02.11]How could I, how would this not light on fire?
[75:04.40]You need fire.
[75:05.60]I need a fire duck.
[75:11.67]Wait, what if we put the fire, the wood right on top of the vent here?
[75:15.75]Can we like roast it?
[75:16.81]Like a marshmallow kind of?
[75:29.18]No, we need, we need a duck that's on fire.
[75:38.64]So the way that you're problem solving is concerning.
[75:40.60]Dude, it's a, it's a duck game.
[75:50.92]I'm not changing a tire.
[76:01.18]You were right the first time.
[76:02.06]Restart.
[76:03.20]Fire.
[76:03.96]Okay.
[76:04.22]Alright.
[76:05.00]We're restarting.
[76:05.58]There's a lot of ducks I haven't seen yet.
[76:09.74]Alright.
[76:12.84]We're going to restart.
[76:16.00]New game.
[76:22.63]Stop bullying Jerma.
[76:23.89]Stop.
[76:24.61]What the heck did I do?
[76:28.57]Thank you.
[76:31.57]You've ruined it?
[76:32.09]I don't think I did.
[76:33.77]I had... Okay, that metal duck was small enough for me to throw.
[76:37.56]I think I need to use the metal duck to break that panel and break the lights.
[76:45.46]Oh, shit.
[76:48.88]I can get them back.
[76:54.83]I'm not getting to a million again.
[76:55.87]I just want to see... I want to see what's behind the panels.
[76:59.05]I want to see the content.
[77:07.87]That's a good strategy for the beginning.
[77:14.97]God damn it.
[77:31.66]Very gently.
[77:48.44]Okay.
[77:54.34]This gives us the metal one?
[77:55.92]No.
[77:56.64]Alright.
[77:58.25]I don't want to use that.
[77:59.37]Okay, keep all the power-ups in the corner.
[78:03.77]Because I don't want to use them until later.
[78:11.88]So now...
[78:36.43]Would you get the wood duck?
[78:37.41]Oh, that's right.
[78:37.95]Alright, wood duck.
[79:02.93]Upgrade the wood, let's see what happens.
[79:13.13]Nothing.
[79:15.11]No upgrade for the wood duck.
[79:19.47]Shit.
[79:20.37]Okay, well, how much is the wood duck worth?
[79:23.41]Nothing?
[79:30.72]Nothing.
[79:34.76]Alright, well, we have to stay with the strategy.
[79:37.10]Strat's going to stay the same.
[79:46.14]What was that?
[79:47.00]Okay.
[79:48.58]Look at the above button?
[79:51.28]Huh?
[79:53.14]Wait.
[79:53.68]What if we get to 1, 3, 5, 6 and just don't do anything?
[80:00.43]Does that make sense?
[80:05.33]Okay.
[80:05.49]1, 3, 5, 6 and then I'm done.
[80:07.38]I'm going to see what happens.
[80:11.08]That's worth 2.
[80:11.40]Alright.
[80:11.66]We're going to do the wiggle strat.
[80:13.58]Yep.
[80:37.05]Alright, keep that power up.
[80:46.67]I probably want all of them over here.
[80:48.29]I have two right now.
[80:50.76]Don't let me forget that because I will.
[80:51.88]1, 3, 5, 6.
[81:14.72]752.
[81:14.76]I don't want anybody bouncing around right now.
[81:29.63]Use the bottom tri-corner.
[81:32.09]I can't really crouch, but that actually worked pretty well.
[81:43.34]I wish I could crouch.
[81:46.44]What's your favorite pasta sauce?
[81:48.24]Uh, that varies.
[81:49.76]Sometimes it's like a tomato, garlic, basil.
[81:51.98]Sometimes it's, um, nothing at all, actually.
[81:56.51]A lot of times it's actually just olive oil and a little bit of salt, a little bit of pepper.
[82:02.47]Uh, that's probably actually my favorite way to eat it.
[82:05.09]My favorite way to eat pasta is just with a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of salt and pepper.
[82:11.86]Maybe sprinkle a little bit of Parmesan, but not necessarily.
[82:16.70]Pesto is amazing too.
[82:29.67]Buttered noodles Andy.
[82:33.07]I would like for all of you to just look up pasta in olive oil and understand that that is a classic dish.
[82:39.95]That is not, that is not like a children's menu dish.
[82:44.05]You actually need to look into that because you've got that wrong.
[82:51.97]This is really upsetting him.
[82:53.30]Alright.
[82:54.62]1, 3, 5, 6.
[83:09.68]Stop bouncing around.
[83:10.48]Yeah, a nice olive oil.
[83:16.90]Pasta.
[83:18.56]Not a whole lot either.
[83:19.38]Just enough to get it coated.
[83:21.19]A little bit, just like a touch of salt.
[83:59.06]he's having fun actually I am actually having a lot of fun alright wait a minute how many bounces to do if I just let it go like right here two three four five six seven oh my god this is gonna be horrible
[85:00.89]Did I get it?
[85:03.40]I don't know what happened.
[85:04.58]I don't understand what I was supposed to do.
[85:17.85]What did I do wrong?
[85:18.83]Nothing happened.
[85:21.74]You understood you just messed it up.
[85:23.36]But what did I do?
[85:24.32]I have to actually restart it?
[85:29.04]You were impatient.
[85:31.62]Do I just stand in the middle of the room at 1, 3, 5, 6?
[85:35.89]You need to click the button.
[85:40.55]It just made the button green.
[85:41.77]Alright, did it actually even do anything?
[85:44.65]Or am I being gaslit?
[86:01.38]3,000.
[86:01.44]What?
[86:02.04]Alright.
[86:04.80]Keep these.
[86:08.83]You lost an upgrade.
[86:09.91]Where's the... Where's the other one?
[86:13.55]Did this thing eat it?
[86:20.70]Okay.
[86:23.24]I want the metal duck, so let's just go ahead and hang out and talk about pasta for another few minutes.
[86:29.46]Alright.
[86:33.07]So... There's the metal one right there.
[86:40.02]Alright, cool.
[86:40.70]Perfect.
[86:48.99]Nice.
[86:49.63]Okay, there's electricity up there now.
[86:52.17]I think that means bomb.
[86:54.83]But let's break everything.
[86:56.77]What happens when I do this?
[87:03.07]You stupid piece of shit.
[87:04.49]You actually got into the corner.
[87:06.11]The DVD menu thing hit the corner.
[87:08.25]It's impossible.
[87:15.43]That's exactly why I placed it all over there.
[87:17.01]Alright, what happens when I do this?
[87:29.26]Okay, that's kind of creepy.
[87:35.76]Don't touch that.
[87:36.48]Okay.
[87:56.55]Now what?
[88:02.23]What was that?
[88:05.98]It's a Satan duck.
[88:06.92]Can I feed it?
[88:14.78]I'm gonna feed the Satan duck.
[88:21.42]You can't.
[88:26.69]Okay.
[88:27.73]So what's the point of this, though?
[88:33.91]Now get the Angel duck.
[88:38.16]Um, okay.
[88:39.06]Angel duck is just... I need points, right?
[88:50.03]What gives a lot of points?
[88:52.05]I gotta catch the, uh... Alright, this is gonna be unbearable.
[88:54.39]I apologize already.
[88:56.05]We have to do this for a minute.
[88:58.09]Uh, I need to grab that and go into the corner and just do the wiggle.
[89:03.51]I need bone duck.
[89:04.41]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[89:09.51]What corner is it in?
[89:10.19]Oh my god.
[89:13.61]Hey, this bone.
[89:27.92]Green button.
[89:32.98]Do not, do not, do not, do not.
[89:35.14]Okay, here we go.
[89:36.78]I think I have enough to do it, don't I?
[89:38.38]Three or four.
[89:40.44]Our angel duck and I have the Satan duck.
[89:44.14]What happens when I put them together?
[90:01.99]Nothing so far.
[90:10.13]I'm glad I have light though.
[90:11.01]Let's put it like right in the middle.
[90:12.03]Alright, there's the blue.
[90:20.11]Hold the bad one?
[90:26.50]Hold on.
[90:35.14]Oh shit, you make them evil!
[90:38.08]Wait.
[90:39.30]Can you do that with the angel duck too?
[90:51.55]You can?
[90:55.35]What is it doing?
[90:57.09]Is it making them just regular size?
[91:05.80]That's an original duck now.
[91:15.39]Make the king evil.
[91:17.21]Can I even upgrade?
[91:19.23]Wrong duck.
[91:28.33]I wish I could see anything.
[91:33.87]Okay, so wait.
[91:35.35]Get over here.
[91:35.73]Does it not do anything?
[91:42.70]Breed the duck decks.
[91:47.51]Dark duck.
[91:49.61]Bomb duck.
[91:51.94]Holy duck.
[91:54.62]Skeleton duck.
[91:55.54]Still missing a few.
[92:00.06]Extra large duck.
[92:00.94]16-bit duck.
[92:04.25]Holy duck.
[92:06.13]Isn't that the one I already have, though?
[92:08.53]Reed.
[92:10.59]Reed.
[92:11.65]I can't, like, open this.
[92:15.10]Throw the wood at the wire.
[92:15.92]I don't want to throw the wood at the wire until I have the bomb.
[92:27.04]That makes sense, doesn't it?
[92:36.14]If I light it right now, will it stay on fire?
[92:45.31]Oh shit, I don't even know where the panel is.
[92:51.37]Not that side.
[92:58.19]Evil duck is removing points.
[92:59.83]That's alright.
[93:05.93]Alright, this is... Alright, here's bomb duck.
[93:09.01]I need to take a second because I need light.
[93:12.33]Where's the bomb panel?
[93:16.96]I just got hit in the head in real life, that felt like.
[93:20.11]Okay, there's this panel.
[93:23.83]The other panel is on the other side, right?
[93:38.47]Where is this panel?
[93:42.74]Where is the panel?
[93:44.63]What side is the panel on?
[93:51.77]Above the button.
[93:52.47]Does that work?
[94:06.98]Hey, dude, do you want to see the burrito I made?
[94:09.56]I'm sure it's delicious, but I'm good.
[94:10.82]Thanks, man.
[94:12.64]There it is.
[94:13.00]Okay, I see.
[94:20.51]Is that it?
[94:26.49]I should have broke this before.
[94:55.99]I want to place that there as a marker.
[94:57.84]Got it.
[95:04.94]Okay.
[95:05.60]Wood duck.
[95:10.10]Where's wooden duck?
[95:12.16]Wooden duck is right here.
[95:15.07]Light wooden duck on fire.
[95:16.33]And then, hold on.
[95:17.71]There's a button to press.
[95:22.31]Okay.
[95:23.29]Put that in the corner over here.
[95:27.11]Okay, where's that bomb panel?
[95:28.99]It's right here.
[95:39.48]Get over here.
[95:48.51]Alright, there it is.
[95:50.97]Can you place instead of throw?
[96:02.83]I don't think you can place.
[96:05.61]I'd like for it to end up hanging out in the corner over there, though.
[96:08.42]Oh, whatever.
[96:08.74]I know where it is.
[96:09.28]Just give it to me.
[96:20.22]I can't just let go of it.
[96:23.90]And when you let go of it, you just whip it against the wall as hard as you can.
[96:26.71]Is it off?
[96:39.22]Okay, it's off.
[96:40.92]Now, I need to just... I have to place this here.
[96:45.20]Like, I have to just figure out how to get it stuck.
[96:50.01]It just bounces way too much.
[96:51.01]We're gonna have to just guess.
[96:54.83]Alright, where's the wood?
[97:13.20]Okay, let's light that.
[97:17.11]Actually, leave that there.
[97:17.95]I'm going to put the bomb right here.
[97:20.17]As close as I can get to this.
[97:23.63]Because it's going to fall.
[97:25.35]And then I need to light it.
[97:26.82]So it's right next to... Okay, it's right here.
[97:29.44]That's probably too close.
[97:46.95]Is that not gonna work?
[97:52.45]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[97:53.93]Okay, okay, okay.
[97:55.15]Where's the bomb?
[97:56.35]Where's the bomb?
[97:58.41]Where's the bomb?
[97:59.68]Where's the bomb?
[98:01.80]How long is that on fire for?
[98:05.76]Get over here.
[98:06.64]Where's the bomb?
[98:13.35]Where-
[98:15.56]Oh my god, you stupid fucking thing.
[98:17.54]I hate that Nyan Cat thing.
[98:19.52]You just ruined everything.
[98:22.18]Where is it now?
[98:24.86]Oh my god, get out of my way.
[98:27.67]Get... Where did it go?
[98:35.85]Where is the... Alright, stop!
[98:42.30]Stop!
[98:44.06]Right there.
[98:44.72]It's directly across.
[98:46.51]No, it's not.
[98:50.21]It's a little bit to the left.
[98:51.45]Alright, here we go.
[98:54.33]I need to grab the bomb.
[98:57.96]It's right here.
[98:59.22]It's not directly across.
[99:08.07]Where did it go?
[99:09.01]Did that stupid Yan Cat thing fucking knock it out of the way?
[99:12.17]I hate that thing so much.
[99:14.66]I don't even know where it is now.
[99:17.60]Where did you knock it?
[99:27.13]Where's the bomb?
[99:28.23]Oh my... Give it to me!
[99:31.11]Oh my god!
[99:42.17]I hate this game.
[99:52.97]Give me my panel back.
[99:59.02]I need one light panel.
[100:05.54]Is it lit?
[100:06.49]Alright, it's lit.
[100:14.84]What is this?
[100:15.24]Is this a purple duck?
[100:17.12]Oh, it's pink.
[100:31.43]Where are you?
[100:32.19]Okay, there he is.
[100:34.43]Now, wait a minute.
[100:35.79]It's right across here.
[100:36.97]I have to... Oh my god!
[100:50.17]Is this gonna be loud?
[100:50.87]Is that in the right spot?
[100:54.69]I got it!
[101:01.63]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[101:05.95]I love this game.
[101:10.56]Okay, now I can break that open with the big metal duck.
[101:17.72]I have power up somewhere, right?
[101:20.44]Oh, do I need a key?
[101:21.20]Do I need a key?
[101:29.40]You have a negative score?
[101:30.51]I just found out you hate him and this game.
[101:41.37]I didn't even want to click on it.
[101:42.59]The Nyan cat pushed it into me.
[101:51.38]break it?
[101:56.22]Do I actually need a key or can I break it?
[101:59.52]I can definitely break it, right?
[102:00.60]Alright, break this.
[102:24.37]I can't.
[102:26.73]Skeleton key duck.
[102:31.50]I already have this.
[102:32.54]I don't have a skeleton anymore.
[102:33.98]Wait, does that actually work?
[102:36.78]Upgrade fire.
[102:41.87]Can't.
[102:44.19]Yeah, skeleton became angel.
[102:49.17]I can't leave without... I gotta at least... I gotta... I can't not open this.
[102:54.47]This is like the big treasure chest of the game.
[102:56.53]Burn it?
[103:04.58]Upgrade the chest?
[103:07.14]Oh.
[103:10.68]You need a negative score.
[103:13.87]Alright, so, alright, alright, alright.
[103:15.19]Let's go, let's go.
[103:15.75]I got it, I got it.
[103:16.61]So we have to make a bunch of devil, um, bunch of devils.
[103:30.34]And that will bring my score negative.
[103:34.12]Is that accurate?
[103:48.55]Alright, this is going to take a little while, so we're going to put a new OST on.
[103:50.97]Can we get a recommendation?
[103:54.44]Maybe make, can you make the Nyan Cat want a devil?
[103:58.26]Um, can I?
[103:58.88]I'm not sure you can.
[104:20.85]Now, I'm not leaving until I open this box.
[104:23.05]This is like the good ending.
[104:24.29]I'm just going to keep making them.
[104:28.91]Can I upgrade them?
[104:36.17]No.
[104:39.92]Alright.
[104:40.80]Yeah, mods get a good four choices.
[104:45.92]Oh.
[104:50.33]And go.
[104:58.88]No one's forcing you to play this.
[105:00.18]I want to play this.
[105:03.06]That's why I'm playing.
[105:09.09]I, not jokingly enough, want to see the end.
[105:25.71]I'm not losing points though.
[105:38.86]Smash the battery again?
[105:40.46]Make a negative battery?
[105:41.90]It sounds a little too complicated.
[105:53.44]I feel like I have to restart to get to the next part.
[105:56.32]But I can't.
[105:59.38]I feel like I gained way too many points with the Nyan Cat one.
[106:02.80]Because I'm going to have to sit here and make a ton of negative scoring ducks, and it's going to take an hour to reverse it.
[106:13.42]I'm going to give it one more try.
[106:16.72]The run's ruined.
[106:17.32]It's alright.
[106:25.82]The key is minus 50K.
[106:27.67]Okay.
[106:30.27]Leaving the lights on this time.
[106:36.99]So this time... The goal is to get... Just don't break the lights.
[106:45.27]Okay.
[106:56.83]You need to break the lights to get devil duck.
[107:00.01]Oh, that's true.
[107:07.01]Need to break the lights eventually.
[107:09.03]Hmm.
[107:14.40]I think.
[107:16.66]Yeah, I think I can get the wood duck first.
[107:19.26]Get the bomb done out of the way.
[107:29.08]Yeah, once I get the chest out, then I can figure that out.
[107:36.70]The bomb will come after the Nyan Cat.
[107:44.75]Hmm.
[107:48.43]Yeah, trying to not get the Nyan Cat to upgrade is the real problem.
[107:58.85]okay what if I do this I'm gonna make a shield so it'll never it'll always have to bounce off of this first it's not gonna ever go in there we need to make a protective box so now it almost physically can't touch it okay
[108:27.61]I'm giving this one more attempt, and then I'm going to open up the Armored Core 6 tutorial and get very angry.
[108:33.75]I don't think I will.
[108:34.27]I think I'll have fun.
[108:42.88]Okay.
[108:44.72]So, what's the order?
[108:45.70]What do you guys think?
[108:47.28]What's the order?
[108:49.24]Wood duck?
[108:52.00]Blow up wall.
[108:53.88]I gotta get metal duck.
[109:02.57]Oh, that's a good idea.
[109:04.49]Hide the batteries in the, where the bone duck was.
[109:20.75]Break one light, make a bunch of children, then once you blow up the wall, turn all the lights out to get the devil and bounce him around.
[109:27.71]Good idea.
[109:28.78]Actually, great idea.
[109:50.77]OK.
[109:52.51]That's about right.
[109:56.85]Alright, we got Hot Wheels Stunt Track coming up.
[110:02.93]Hot Wheels Stunt Track OST.
[110:08.07]What was this for?
[110:08.63]Hot Wheels Stunt Track OST.
[110:14.75]I think this is correct.
[110:24.63]Alright, I'm into this.
[110:32.08]Cool.
[110:44.05]It's like rubber ducky death metal.
[110:57.25]He's saying all kinds of fucked up shit right now.
[111:12.87]This is not death metal.
[111:15.11]Listen to this death metal.
[111:22.23]You need to open poke scream right now.
[111:23.93]It's very important.
[111:26.47]Why?
[111:41.55]Magical healing.
[111:43.57]This warlock thing.
[111:45.99]This warlock.
[111:46.97]This warlock.
[111:49.11]This warlock item.
[111:55.02]He's kind of doing it to the beat.
[111:59.24]Oh, keep going.
[112:01.02]You're cooking right now.
[112:02.60]Just keep farming money.
[112:03.36]It's got a lot of gold.
[112:04.31]We should start investing on items.
[112:08.07]Is it cheating if my viewers send me items and I buy it for a good price?
[112:12.95]Does he have my stream up behind him?
[112:22.49]This sounds like a promo for Poke's stream.
[112:26.99]Like, here's the crazy stuff that Poke gets up to.
[112:37.26]We've been caught.
[112:40.00]Yeah, it was awesome.
[112:43.46]I got to a million points and I'm still working.
[112:45.56]I'm still trying to figure out how to get the box open, which has been pretty interesting so far.
[112:55.53]I can't listen to the stream anymore because I'm listening to myself three times.
[112:59.85]How do I get the box open?
[113:03.29]Well, I'm going to
[113:05.75]I believe in you.
[113:06.31]I'm stealing his content right here.
[113:12.91]Thanks, Jerma, for the content.
[113:22.50]He just starts throwing shit in his room.
[113:25.22]That kind of sounded like he's doing his own duck bouncing.
[113:28.96]He's like, oh, hey, thanks.
[113:30.24]I got some ideas now.
[113:32.06]He just starts picking up shit in his room and throwing it into the walls.
[113:40.08]Alright, let's keep going.
[113:54.52]Hold on a second.
[113:55.45]This is important.
[113:59.47]Let's see if we can get ourselves up on the... Don't say anything to Poke.
[114:39.26]You're sweating?
[114:41.06]Hohohohoho!
[114:58.56]I was not sweating this much when I played Elden Ring.
[115:02.65]It's just my right arm, too.
[115:04.75]My left underarm is perfectly fine.
[115:07.79]Holy shit!
[115:10.03]Alright, well, that was fun.
[115:10.99]Alright, alright.
[115:15.17]Stay with what I was doing.
[115:20.33]What did I get behind him?
[115:28.76]Did I get to be on the screen behind him?
[115:31.66]Good.
[115:32.00]Was it good?
[115:32.36]He's in the middle of like a hard fight in Dark and Darker and I'm just sitting there behind him.
[115:40.60]I'm just not smoking behind him.
[115:46.96]Hold on.
[115:47.22]Here's the clip.
[115:47.84]Hold on.
[115:48.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[115:48.82]This is important.
[115:49.28]I want to see this.
[115:54.53]Where's the clip?
[115:56.63]Let me see.
[116:07.39]I gotta get this on.
[116:08.75]Hold on a sec.
[116:17.27]We gotta get this on the big screen.
[116:18.83]Hold on.
[116:25.26]Oh, where is it?
[116:28.34]Okay.
[116:29.76]Here we go.
[116:44.30]Alright, here we go.
[116:44.82]Let's see.
[116:49.50]Okay.
[116:49.66]Dude, your name's a bad look for me, man.
[116:55.82]I'm just gonna say it right now.
[117:07.13]Guys, I don't know him.
[117:13.03]That's so stupid.
[117:14.61]I love it.
[117:15.57]He's flipping me off.
[117:17.67]Oh, you can see him like pull out.
[117:24.66]Oh, that's great.
[117:27.66]Oh, that's I love that.
[117:29.24]That was amazing.
[117:31.24]OK.
[117:35.59]OK.
[117:36.85]So.
[117:40.07]Uh, let's get back to the game.
[117:48.30]What was I doing?
[117:49.18]I forget what I was doing.
[117:52.44]Back to business?
[117:52.98]Yeah.
[117:55.24]He stayed full screen after that because he was in the middle of a huge... Oh, I need the music.
[118:03.53]I can't just have no music on.
[118:05.39]What's going on here?
[118:16.25]OK.
[118:18.09]So.
[118:20.99]Stay with the plan.
[118:35.30]I'm doing this and this is it.
[118:38.40]I'm having fun with this, but.
[118:43.06]I want to do this tutorial in Armored Core and then turn my stream off.
[118:59.18]the battery in the corner yo yep yep yep yep oh yeah we do not want that nyan duck to touch this hopefully this is a good spot
[119:30.42]We need the metal duck.
[119:37.44]Get wooden duck right now.
[119:41.16]What was the process to get wooden duck?
[119:42.81]I need to break this.
[119:43.51]Let me break it.
[119:45.37]I can't break that without metal duck.
[119:46.57]I think I have to keep going.
[119:52.43]Ah, that's right.
[119:52.79]It's a button.
[119:53.27]Thank you.
[119:53.57]Appreciate it.
[120:05.85]Oh my god, I've lost it.
[120:07.13]Lost my touch here.
[120:07.83]Okay.
[120:15.52]Looking good so far.
[120:16.44]So now...
[120:31.44]now I just need to get enough points to get uh you know dude I that's just putting up like like a lot of the rings
[121:03.22]Would we both get banned?
[121:24.15]Okay.
[121:25.11]I think we're close.
[121:28.18]Alright, do not bounce into the corner.
[121:32.50]At all.
[121:37.20]We're going to continue.
[121:37.88]What do you mean ruined?
[121:39.32]What?
[121:43.60]Upgrade the normal duck.
[121:45.34]Guard the corner.
[121:46.04]No, it is.
[121:47.16]It's blocked over there.
[121:47.78]Okay, we have to hurry up because we need to start.
[121:51.54]We need the blue duck.
[121:56.33]Then we got to get rid of all the lights.
[122:14.52]Did I fuck it up?
[122:21.42]Don't break this.
[122:24.60]Put poke stream in your corner.
[122:26.25]I can't.
[122:29.21]I can't, dude.
[122:30.69]That's... You just broke it?
[122:37.91]I'm paying attention to too many things right now.
[122:42.94]I need the blue duck.
[122:44.14]I'm going with what I know.
[122:54.36]His Sims queue is full right now.
[122:56.52]That is a good way to put it, seriously.
[123:01.91]Actually, a great way to put it.
[123:02.99]Do you ever get that way, though?
[123:05.23]Honestly, no, like joking around.
[123:10.55]Okay, here comes now the strategy that that chatter said.
[123:15.99]Don't you dare touch that.
[123:41.51]You cannot upgrade the wooden one, unfortunately.
[123:43.25]It's not upgradable.
[123:45.51]I think I need like 5000.
[123:52.22]Put Poke's webcam on your stream.
[124:20.31]But that would mean Poke would have to be full cam for me to do that.
[124:27.61]He would have to be full cam pretending to play this game.
[124:31.33]I don't think that's going to happen.
[124:33.19]No, Poke is playing dark and dark.
[124:34.97]He's probably having a good time.
[124:38.75]Crop it so...
[124:50.89]Now you've got me.
[124:51.91]Now you got me interested.
[124:53.07]Alright, hold on.
[124:55.93]This is going to take a minute.
[124:56.89]Don't tell him we're doing this.
[124:57.95]I know you guys are going to rat us out.
[125:22.67]Okay, this is going to take a second because I'm going to have to crop it well.
[125:33.37]Should I just stop talking to him?
[125:36.03]Don't tell him.
[125:38.11]I'm going to stop talking to him.
[125:39.77]This is going to be actually fucking hilarious.
[125:41.97]Hold on a second.
[125:50.99]Nobody blow this because this might be very funny.
[125:54.93]He's going to be talking about the game.
[125:56.35]His game is going to be like, what is he talking about?
[125:58.35]Okay, hold on.
[126:00.96]I need this to be bigger.
[126:12.53]Turn it up.
[126:17.83]I have to do this quick because the background in his stream is going to change.
[126:20.91]Okay, where are we?
[126:30.73]Shit, that's not the right one.
[126:42.20]Okay.
[126:42.48]Give me a sec.
