[00:00.11]I want to thank you guys for being here.
[00:01.23]What's going on, everybody?
[00:02.11]My name is Miz Kiff, and I am your teacher for tonight.
[00:05.48]This guest has been requested probably more than any guest I've ever seen.
[00:09.98]My chat raves for him.
[00:11.20]Many people do, except for this one guy on Twitter who said, who is that?
[00:14.90]But this man is a crowd favorite.
[00:18.06]People are pause champing already for their excitement.
[00:20.75]I can't believe I'm introducing him tonight, and I'm glad he is here.
[00:24.13]Give it up, baby, for the one, the legend himself, Jerma.
[00:30.30]That's quite the introduction.
[00:33.26]You deserve it.
[00:34.70]You deserve it.
[00:35.32]You are a crowd favorite.
[00:36.10]My crowd loves you.
[00:36.84]They think you're great and they believe in you tonight.
[00:40.53]Thanks for having me on the show, man.
[00:41.85]I'm excited.
[00:42.77]Yeah.
[00:43.09]Last time I talked to you was in what, 2017?
[00:45.99]And it was for about five minutes and you were eating a cookie.
[00:49.54]Yeah, you kind of did.
[00:50.46]I was just sitting at a table.
[00:52.00]You kind of sat down.
[00:52.68]You were like, hi.
[00:54.11]I was like, hey, who are you?
[00:55.41]You're like, hey, can I sit down?
[00:57.31]Can I sit down?
[00:57.79]And I'm like, yep, I guess you can sit down.
[01:00.23]How are you?
[01:00.79]Did I really do that?
[01:02.03]Yeah, you just like sat at the table I was sitting at.
[01:04.69]I have no social awareness.
[01:06.09]That is my fault.
[01:06.85]I'm sorry.
[01:07.08]Neither do I. It was perfect.
[01:09.20]Oh, cool, cool, cool.
[01:10.58]Jeremiah, what is your, see, like the thing is, you're so fresh around here.
[01:14.32]What is your background?
[01:15.06]What have you done?
[01:16.76]Surely you're a scholar.
[01:18.68]You mean like education?
[01:20.66]Of course.
[01:22.46]I mean, I've got a PhD.
[01:25.14]Wow.
[01:26.56]Are you serious?
[01:27.26]Talk about it.
[01:28.66]Well, most people don't know about that about me.
[01:30.95]I went to school for engineering.
[01:32.21]You have a PhD in engineering?
[01:35.97]Jesus.
[01:37.70]Jesus Christ.
[01:38.50]You're all fucked.
[01:40.80]Oh, baby.
[01:41.56]He put that one to the chest for a long time.
[01:44.28]He did not let the crowd know that.
[01:45.80]That is insane.
[01:47.58]An engineer, a PhD, Jerma.
[01:49.72]That's right.
[01:50.46]Do you think you have what it takes to win tonight?
[01:53.28]Yes.
[01:54.76]That is incredible.
[01:55.72]Jerma, what is your fun fact about yourself?
[01:58.48]Oh, I'm supposed to have a fun fact?
[02:03.21]thanks for having me what is this shit I asked for a fun fact you had 20 minutes to write it and you drew thanks for having me with a picture of tommy pickles I've got a really I've got a really long neck see look I didn't know I didn't know that's what we're supposed to do I asked I said I said 20 minutes I said you have to just forget it alright we're gonna move on to our next guest uh
[02:27.78]It's fine.
[02:28.18]Just forget it.
[02:28.75]Just forget about it.
[02:29.49]Alright, we're going to move on to our next guest.
[02:30.85]Jerma has completely flunked that.
[02:32.29]It's fine.
[02:32.73]Let's see if he can get past the first grade.
[02:34.53]Whatever, man.
[02:34.89]Are we in the same house?
[02:39.69]We're split personalities, I think.
[02:42.29]We have the same exact shelf.
[02:44.39]Wait, you shop at Ikea, too?
[02:48.14]Look.
[02:48.88]I thought that was a Canada thing.
[02:51.32]No, I love Ikea.
[02:53.38]Let's show Jerma.
[02:54.34]Oh, you guys have the same shelf.
[02:56.16]We're in the same house.
[02:58.10]You even got the light and everything.
[02:59.64]You got the Twitch light behind you.
[03:01.36]Yeah, look.
[03:04.64]Where do you live?
[03:05.22]I live in Vancouver, British Columbia.
[03:07.56]It's like the anti-Las Vegas kind of.
[03:11.44]Yeah, I'm here.
[03:12.46]I have two degrees, so I feel some expectation to make it far.
[03:16.94]Are we all doing the we have degrees joke?
[03:20.70]No, I actually have two degrees.
[03:22.26]I have one degree.
[03:23.30]I didn't know it was a joke.
[03:23.96]I only have half, so.
[03:25.24]You made a joke and culturally appropriated my upbringing, Jerma.
[03:29.74]Wait a minute.
[03:30.13]You're lying, Jerma?
[03:30.85]I thought you were telling the truth.
[03:32.88]No, that was horseshit.
[03:33.92]What are you talking about?
[03:35.76]I thought you were fucking serious.
[03:36.94]I thought you were dead serious.
[03:38.40]Have you seen one minute of any of my streams?
[03:40.47]You think I have a PhD in engineering?
[03:42.45]You're very well spoken.
[03:44.79]I actually believed everything you said.
[03:46.01]That's all a mask, man.
[03:47.09]I watched you power wash, and I was like, that could be PhD levels of power washing.
[03:51.75]What's wrong with you?
[03:53.77]I just met you.
[03:54.55]Maybe it was smarter.
[03:57.32]I don't know.
[03:57.94]Why would you lie to me?
[03:58.72]I'm your teacher.
[03:59.66]I'm your teacher.
[04:00.26]You should not lie.
[04:00.86]I also lied.
[04:03.92]Anybody here considering playing Battleship on their streams?
[04:06.30]I gotta make that really clear.
[04:08.48]No.
[04:09.04]Anybody in this call at all considering Battleship on their streams at all?
[04:13.92]I've considered it.
[04:15.20]You have?
[04:16.20]Yeah.
[04:17.04]Okay.
[04:18.26]I'm just checking.
[04:19.76]That's very important to me.
[04:23.18]Okay, that's it.
[04:24.14]It's like the start of a street magician's trick or something like that.
[04:27.68]I'm nervous now.
[04:28.96]So can I ask why?
[04:30.28]I'm just curious.
[04:31.38]Why do you want to play Battleship?
[04:33.94]No, I just was curious if anybody in this call had a plan to play Battleship on their stream.
[04:41.28]I got a show, man.
[04:42.95]I think I might play Battleship on my stream next time.
[04:45.67]Alright.
[04:47.87]I have a bet with my chat, and it's important.
[04:50.81]I feel like you're starting a new meta right now before our eyes.
[04:53.53]Good luck to you all.
[04:54.63]We are going to start with kindergarten.
[04:56.69]You know, I was thinking about getting all these questions wrong, like as a joke.
[05:02.21]Jeremy, please don't.
[05:03.85]I'd be gone in the fourth grade.
[05:05.80]Jeremy, please don't.
[05:06.38]You're the reason why people are here.
[05:08.20]Jeremy, if you're out, then I'm out, alright?
[05:10.16]Look, let's just end this.
[05:11.28]We're going to go together?
[05:13.08]Let's just watch the Capcom special and get out of here.
[05:15.94]Alright, let's go.
[05:18.49]So even though I'm pretty sure I'm right, it's just that doubt in your mind where you're like, are you wrong?
[05:22.33]Honestly, me too.
[05:24.05]What you write cannot be correct.
[05:25.53]I don't know.
[05:26.79]I really thought I was going to get that wrong.
[05:28.33]I really did.
[05:28.94]I kind of did too.
[05:30.80]Well, you guys should all be very proud of yourselves.
[05:33.02]Let's get some pogs in chat for them and some hearts in chat for Dream.
[05:36.50]We are now into the first grade, which means you guys have passed kindergarten.
[05:40.94]Be proud of yourselves.
[05:41.68]Thank God.
[05:45.62]We did it.
[05:46.00]Alright.
[05:46.88]I keep second, third, and fourth, and fifth guessing this.
[05:49.18]Yeah, I did the exact same thing.
[05:51.43]Yo.
[05:53.39]Rinaldo, your chat keeps calling me sus.
[05:55.73]Would you just fucking tell him?
[05:57.53]Why do you have my chat open out of everyone's chat?
[06:01.25]I just... Rinaldo, stop having your chat spam sus for some stupid-ass reason.
[06:04.83]They're not even... Now they're spamming it.
[06:06.41]They were calling me sus.
[06:07.31]Like, look, I don't know what to tell them, but, you know.
[06:11.43]alright what did you guys put for 30 minus 11. look I didn't want to like bring this up but my noise gate is screwed up so it looks like I'm talking all the time if I don't mute when I'm not talking and then people have like that among us proximity chat like Discord bubble overlay on and they're like why does this guy look like he's talking all the time and it just well I've never had a more chatty our next question and then we get to second grade
[06:35.79]Let's move on.
[06:36.33]We're at second grade already?
[06:37.73]I didn't think I was gonna make it this far.
[06:39.43]Time flies, man.
[06:40.75]Am I stupid?
[06:41.63]No.
[06:43.05]Pause it in.
[06:43.45]I got it.
[06:45.45]Jerma.
[06:46.43]34 plus 56.

[06:47.57]90.
[06:48.95]And that is... Correct, Ludwig.
[06:53.42]Is that a 42?
[06:54.54]I almost wrote 80.
[06:56.68]Fuck, I ain't gonna be here for very long.
[06:58.26]The answer is 90.
[07:01.40]Good job.
[07:02.10]Oh, fuck.
[07:04.80]Ah...

[07:16.32]Weird noise?
[07:17.40]What constitutes a weird noise?

[08:02.12]What does that mean?
[08:03.58]What does PSA mean?
[08:04.84]Pounds per square inch?
[08:07.04]It's the prostate exam.
[08:08.74]Rating matters.
[08:10.34]No, I had one of those recently.
[08:11.78]That's a DRE.
[08:12.72]That's a DRE.
[08:13.36]I know what that is.
[08:16.26]I had one of those.
[08:16.80]Imagine they rated you after a prostate exam.
[08:19.60]Yeah, you have a PSA 10.
[08:20.30]For a butthole attempt.
[08:23.55]The blank is considered to be the powerhouse of the cell.

[08:34.90]Ready?
[08:35.16]Three, two, one.
[08:36.04]The answer is the mitochondria.
[08:37.54]Where did you guys put it?
[08:39.19]I thought it was the nucleus alright I thought too I thought it was nucleus for a second that's the center right and nucleus but the middle like I don't know I thought initially I was like wait is the middle like the most powerful part I don't know the primary colors one was look you all got it right we have to complain can we just keep moving on if you put a fraction up here and I'm just going to draw pictures
[09:00.14]Melaina made 30 beaded bracelets.
[09:03.37]She plans to sell the bracelets at a weekend craft fair.
[09:06.71]She spent a total of $12 on beads and $3 on wire and clasps.
[09:13.16]She sells each bracelet for $20.
[09:16.34]What's her total profit?
[09:18.40]Can you give me a little extra time?
[09:20.16]Can we get like three minutes?
[09:22.07]Can I get a little extra time?
[09:23.61]We'll give you an extra 30 seconds.
[09:25.59]I feel like I'm in the classroom.
[09:27.61]Everyone's just like yelling in my ears and I'm just like being speech jammed.
[09:31.28]I know, Jerma.
[09:31.86]That's exactly how I feel.
[09:32.70]Is it per bracelet or overall?
[09:33.72]It's going to be per bracelet, right?
[09:39.05]You gotta tell us.
[09:39.67]It doesn't clarify.
[09:40.66]What do you mean?
[09:41.34]Are you shaking your head?
[09:42.30]That's true.
[09:43.06]That's all.
[09:43.38]Milena made 30 breeded.
[09:44.70]I know.
[09:45.24]It says a total.
[09:46.36]Breeded.
[09:47.80]Milena made bread.
[09:49.30]Milena made 30 beaded bracelets.
[09:51.12]She plants.
[09:52.28]She plants.
[09:52.93]I gotta start working.
[09:56.33]I haven't comprehended the question.
[09:57.99]I know.
[09:58.89]I'm freaking out.
[09:59.99]Milena made.
[10:00.67]Shut up.
[10:01.25]Milena made.
[10:01.81]Milena made.
[10:03.87]Skip this question.
[10:05.42]But Miz, did she sell them or not?
[10:07.10]Because we don't know what her profit is.
[10:08.84]It says she sells the bracelet.
[10:12.36]That's present.
[10:13.08]That's present.
[10:13.80]That's progressive.
[10:14.78]But we don't know what it is.
[10:16.56]Progressive text.
[10:18.42]You have to skip this one.
[10:20.27]We have to skip it.
[10:22.59]You're wasting so much time.
[10:24.21]Yes.
[10:24.49]That would have been proper.
[10:26.07]Do we know?
[10:26.89]Did she sell them or not?
[10:27.93]What is 200 minus 50?
[10:28.61]There's your answer.
[10:29.61]Go ahead.
[10:30.01]What's 200 minus 50?
[10:33.48]Is that related to the question or not?
[10:35.82]We're moving on to the next question.
[10:37.48]Why do you have numbers in your math equation?
[10:39.64]Arrows were me moving around the room trying to find a quiet place to work.
[10:42.72]I'm going to be honest with you now.
[10:56.45]The interior angles of a triangle always add up to how many degrees?
[11:01.71]Am I the only person that's gonna get this wrong?
[11:04.05]No, you got this.
[11:07.37]The interior angles of a triangle add up to 180.
[11:09.17]What did you guys put?
[11:10.47]Oh, no.
[11:11.33]Oh, they add up?
[11:13.17]Oh, shit.
[11:14.96]When was the last time anyone even thought of a triangle?
[11:16.66]Like a fucking Dorito you ate last week?
[11:18.36]Yeah, no shit.
[11:19.04]Thank you.
[11:21.02]Bullshit.
[11:22.14]What scientific instrument is used to measure air pressure?
[11:25.06]Oh, fuck you.
[11:26.32]Oh, who knows this in fourth grade?
[11:30.05]Are you kidding me?
[11:30.83]My dad is a meteorologist.
[11:32.43]I'm not feeling great about this, but Jerma's confidence is because he's a fucking blue collar East Coast Chad.
[11:37.55]Alright, I'll give you a hint.
[11:40.37]If you just shut up.
[11:41.11]Ready?
[11:42.27]It starts with the B-A-R.
[11:46.15]Oh, I know what it is.
[11:47.19]That's not the fucking answer.
[11:48.87]No, it's not.
[11:49.97]You'll be surprised.
[11:51.69]You're going to be surprised.
[11:52.79]Let's see if they get it.
[11:53.39]What scientific instrument is used to measure?
[11:54.81]I only know this because of the Steve Harvey quote.
[11:56.92]Do you remember that one, Jerma?
[11:58.82]I have no clue.
[11:59.96]I don't want to get extra credit for getting it actually right.
[12:03.26]Yeah, I would appreciate that extra credit for actually getting it right.
[12:05.42]Yeah, me too.
[12:06.58]I don't think that they deserve it.
[12:08.58]I don't think this class deserves anything.
[12:10.38]You wrote the answer on the board.
[12:12.40]You did write the answer on the board.
[12:13.82]Yeah, he did that for the color.
[12:16.92]What is 6.72 times 2.05?
[12:19.48]Are you fucking my ass?
[12:23.33]I'll give you guys an extra minute.
[12:26.01]You got any way more than that, right?
[12:29.90]I don't know what's the question I'm gonna get this wrong it's okay you have time you have time don't freak out way yes time is up oh one was a little challenge although there is a trick to it like Austin said what is 6.72 times 2.05 you all put Pokémon 6.4 did I get it right I don't know
[12:58.53]It is 13.776.
[12:58.85]I would have had it.
[13:01.75]I said less time.
[13:02.45]I just didn't have enough time.
[13:04.21]Who was commonly known... No.
[13:05.90]Extra credit to two.
[13:06.68]Who was commonly known as the last pharaoh of Egypt?
[13:13.14]Well, it's been a pleasure.
[13:14.64]Really nice to see everybody.
[13:16.65]Jerma, come on, buddy.
[13:17.29]You got this.
[13:17.75]Don't think too hard.
[13:20.11]Think of a pharaoh.
[13:23.77]Think of the pharaoh.
[13:28.01]It's the only thing I can think of.
[13:29.55]It's the only thing that comes to my mind.
[13:31.93]There's only one pharaoh that I could think of, and that's the only one I put down.
[13:35.09]And that is your answer.
[13:36.05]I will tell you that is the answer.
[13:38.48]You have too much knowledge.
[13:39.58]I've already buzzed in.
[13:40.38]Did I get it right?
[13:42.10]I can't tell you.
[13:43.86]Poki is the most common pharaoh of them all.
[13:48.36]She is the most common pharaoh of them all.
[13:51.10]Confidence restored.
[13:52.19]Wait, she?
[13:53.07]I'm out.
[13:54.23]See you later.
[13:55.65]Alright.
[13:56.09]It's been a great time.
[13:58.44]Who is commonly known as the last pharaoh of Egypt?
[14:00.90]What did you all put?
[14:02.72]King Tutankhamun.
[14:04.24]King Tut.
[14:05.58]It's Cleopatra.
[14:06.82]Is it?
[14:07.10]Cleopatra, of course.
[14:08.70]She was a pharaoh?
[14:11.10]I thought it was King Tut.
[14:12.76]I thought it was King Tut, too.
[14:14.11]It's the only Pharaoh I could think of.
[14:16.27]Oh, my God.
[14:17.15]Connor and Northernlion hold it.
[14:19.67]Pokimane also getting out fifth.
[14:21.19]And Jerma, baby, no.
[14:22.67]Give us a college question.
[14:23.87]Give us a college question to get it back.
[14:27.50]Okay, you know what?
[14:28.54]It's up.
[14:29.20]Let us finish the grade out.
[14:30.80]Jerma and Pokimane, I'm going to give you two minutes on the clock.
[14:35.02]Sophomore year finance.
[14:37.14]Let's see if your engineering degrees played through.
[14:41.57]What is the total interest made after four years on a simple interest loan that accumulates 13% each year and has original amount was $1,350.
[14:51.28]It's so hard.
[14:57.30]General, what are you doing?
[14:59.48]I'm trying to process.
[15:01.16]Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[15:01.74]Is there like an easy way to do this?
[15:06.71]I don't know.
[15:08.27]The answer is no, there isn't.
[15:11.60]You got to do it.
[15:12.38]It compounds on itself.
[15:13.98]Yeah.
[15:20.31]Both engineers with PhDs.
[15:22.91]I made that up.
[15:23.83]I'm an E clown.
[15:25.13]I don't know anything.
[15:27.01]Why did you lie to me?
[15:27.79]That's all you got on the show.
[15:29.29]Can we get more than that?
[15:31.31]Because, you know, usually you're used to using calculators.
[15:34.33]Yes, queen.
[15:34.91]Alright, give him an extra 30 seconds.
[15:37.08]There's no fucking way I'm going to do this.
[15:40.04]It was a pleasure, everybody.
[15:43.90]Jeremiah looking everywhere but his monitor.
[15:47.00]I literally just got nothing open.
[15:49.34]You'll see by the answer.
[15:50.57]Come on, Jeremiah.
[15:51.11]You can do this.
[15:57.29]I feel like fucking Jim Carrey in that movie where he drove the number 23 a thousand times on his wall.
[16:04.07]The answer is not 23, by the way.
[16:14.18]Jeremiah does not want me to tell him.
[16:15.98]He does not want to listen to the fact that he's going to be eliminated.
[16:19.22]Yeah.
[16:19.52]It's been fun.
[16:21.92]Zero seconds on the clock.
[16:24.37]Okay, wait, wait.
[16:25.17]I think I have an answer.
[16:26.55]And then, and then, yeah.
[16:28.43]And then you got the wrong answer, Poki.
[16:30.41]The answer is $702.
[16:30.97]Wait, but don't you...
[16:35.53]be 2k total 2k something well my process was correct but my end was wrong it was the total interest we were looking for not the total amount oh not the total total my bad uh Jerma yes yeah it was a wild guess it was a wild guess and it was a wild ride having you on my show Jerma I very much appreciate you being here the crowd is booing and very sad right now I
