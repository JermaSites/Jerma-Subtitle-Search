[ve:61.7.100]

[00:00.71]I feel like I'm in a Disney movie where the main character comes into class, and he's late by one second, and he gets detention.
[00:11.94]Let's see what I'm talking about.
[00:12.82]He's got books in his hands.
[00:14.24]He's like, oh, no, my first day.
[00:16.62]Sprinting down.
[00:17.24]Which one?
[00:19.34]102?
[00:19.74]Where's 102?
[00:20.70]Math.
[00:21.44]Oh, shoot.
[00:22.98]He drops a book on the ground.
[00:23.94]He gets in.
[00:25.50]He doesn't sit down.
[00:27.73]Mr. Elbertson, you're late.
[00:31.01]Oh, man.
[00:33.71]And we don't take kindly to late students.
[00:37.86]And they get detention.
[00:42.42]Is that what's happening right now?
[00:44.78]Is it JoJo reference?
[00:47.60]That happens in JoJo?
[00:48.63]Guys, everything happens in a TV show.
[00:51.31]Do you have any idea how many TV shows exist?
[00:55.49]Think of every second of television.
[00:57.93]I'm sure what I'm saying has happened in a hundred different series.
[01:04.39]Yeah, that was a fucking JoJo reference.
[01:07.07]No, it's a human reference.
[01:09.19]Because people are late.
[01:10.36]And then people make references to human behavior in their TV shows.
[01:15.72]I'm never watching it now.
[01:18.36]Wait, is that?
[01:18.88]Oh, that's a meme.
[01:19.48]Okay.
[01:20.08]Sorry.
[01:20.46]Hold on.
[01:20.78]I'll be right back.
[01:22.20]See, I gotta tweet this.
[01:22.96]Be right back.
[01:53.85]Alright, so tonight we're gonna do obviously community content night.
[01:59.43]Make sure I don't hear myself in my own microphone.
[02:01.83]Good thing I don't.
[02:03.69]Let's make sure I don't hear this either.
[02:05.55]Uh, we gotta have a good OST.
[02:10.54]What's a good OST?
[02:13.36]Gonna be ready for more JoJo tonight?
[02:15.58]I have something to tell you, those of you waiting for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video files.
[02:22.36]I don't think there's any.
[02:24.56]I think there might be one reference to it.
[02:26.74]I don't think there's any.
[02:30.11]This is up till March 1st, by the way.
[02:33.85]So this is from late January all through February.
[02:37.94]And we're going to do another catch up here.
[02:40.90]We're going to do a second community content night.
[02:44.14]Probably at some point a week or so from now.
[02:48.93]And we're going to try to catch up through March into April.
[02:52.05]So then we'll be really actually caught up with community content night.
[02:57.45]Boomer content night.
[02:59.45]Come on.
[03:06.69]I didn't like where my mic was.
[03:08.61]I changed it.
[03:10.83]Anyways, yeah, we have... There's a lot of submissions.
[03:13.52]A lot of stuff to go through.
[03:14.90]Gonna hang out and play.
[03:15.66]We have a bunch of subs.
[03:17.28]AmnesticOW.
[03:20.40]Just gave 10 community subs.
[03:21.50]Thank you, Amnestic.
[03:22.32]And TheChef'sCorner.
[03:23.68]I feel like the last few nights, last three or four streams, TheChef'sCorner has opened us up with at least 5 to 10 community subs, so thank you.
[03:32.23]It's a lot.
[03:34.07]Thanks, both of you.
[03:36.89]I missed the pre-stream chat.
[03:38.09]Pepe hands.
[03:38.99]It's okay.
[03:39.95]There'll be plenty more.
[03:42.43]So, tomorrow, after we do this, tomorrow is going to be public domain movie night.
[03:49.75]I have a few things to say about that.
[03:52.19]So, we're going to start with The Gorilla.
[03:56.40]The Gorilla is a public domain movie from 1939 about a killer gorilla.
[04:05.10]Apparently the movie sucks.
[04:06.60]Total ass.
[04:08.48]And it's only an hour long.
[04:10.94]This full movie is one hour long.
[04:13.46]So we're going to be watching another one too.
[04:18.76]I'm trying not to look too hard into this movie.
[04:21.98]But I've heard that it's... It's a horror comedy, if you could believe it.
[04:29.21]And we're gonna open with it.
[04:30.59]And we have to watch the whole thing.
[04:31.99]That's part of this.
[04:33.81]We don't get to skip anything.
[04:35.01]We don't get to change anything.
[04:36.61]We have to stay there and watch it for the hour.
[04:38.87]Well, you don't have to, but I do.
[04:40.25]Because this is my stream.
[04:42.94]It's like, if you think it's stupid, and you're like, nah, I'm fucking out of here, that's fine.
[04:46.32]I have to watch the whole thing.
[04:47.36]So, we'll see.
[04:52.55]But I'll have a second one queued up after that, which will be a mystery movie.
[04:56.87]Speaking of more subs... Nondescript Civilian and Neftwitch.
[05:02.88]Nondescript gave 10 community subs, and Neftwitch gave 5 community subs.
[05:11.56]30 community subs have come in in like the last 30 seconds.
[05:13.70]Thanks, guys.
[05:15.69]VOD viewers will skip.
[05:17.49]The one time we're being a VOD viewer.
[05:21.38]is like, whoa, you got an advantage here.
[05:23.40]I'm telling you.
[05:29.72]Play Yoshi's Island OST.
[05:30.90]Yeah, we got to get a good OST.
[05:35.12]Let's do an OST that we haven't done like a thousand times.
[05:40.43]We keep doing Yoshi's story and stuff.
[05:48.38]Invader is another five community subs.
[05:51.80]Thanks for another five.
[05:54.06]It makes like 40 or 30 or 50.
[05:55.74]I can't even keep track.
[05:57.86]There's just so many.
[05:58.73]You guys give so much money to this stream.
[06:00.37]It's fucking insane.
[06:02.55]Mario Galaxy?
[06:03.75]Mario Galaxy is too upbeat, I think.
[06:06.83]Mario Galaxy is like... That's too... I don't want to be so energetic.
[06:15.73]I need to be relaxed and hanging out.
[06:21.23]Sonic Rush?
[06:21.83]No, that's too much.
[06:22.81]That's a heavy guitar.
[06:24.17]I don't want heavy guitar.

[10:29.22]Whatever.
[10:29.72]I don't care.
[10:31.30]When I turn to the side, you're gonna see.
[10:33.58]Like, this is what it's gonna be like.
[10:36.08]So what the fuck do I care?
[10:37.02]And I know it looks like somebody put melted chocolate on my head.
[10:42.12]But that's just the way it is.

[11:46.46]That's fine, whatever.
[11:48.60]Alright, let's get started.
[11:49.99]I'm going to shrink myself a little bit.
[11:56.60]There's another hundred fucking dollars.
[11:59.48]A hundred more dollars.
[12:01.40]This is like four or five hundred dollars in 15 minutes.
[12:07.64]Holy shit.
[12:08.32]Okay, that's... Boz... Boz... Kirtlar.
[12:14.88]Boz Kirtlar gave a hundred dollars.
[12:17.98]Greetings from Sweden.
[12:18.88]Hello from the United States of America, specifically the Las Vegas City.
[12:23.58]They say, long time viewer, first time donator.
[12:25.32]Oh, and also play Yakuza 0.
[12:26.64]I already did, and I gave up on it because I have the attention span of a fucking 8-year-old.
[12:32.58]But thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[12:36.20]Alright, we got our first JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference.
[12:39.28]Hey, Tona, thanks for the 10 subs.
[12:41.64]I'll just bring in $500.
[12:42.62]Holy shit, guys.
[12:43.34]You're out of your minds.
[12:50.58]We got Gloom Man and the rat.
[12:52.46]And, of course, the BA in the background.
[12:53.66]This is very well done.
[12:55.70]Not to say the last one wasn't well done, but this one is very good.
[12:59.70]Put on clown music.
[13:00.62]What do you mean clown music?
[13:09.74]Oh, no.
[13:10.04]The rat got confirmed for Smash.
[13:16.09]Clown.
[13:16.73]Clown.
[13:17.17]Clown.
[13:17.59]Clown.
[13:19.48]I don't get it.
[13:23.87]What is clown OST?
[13:24.95]That doesn't make any sense.
[13:27.61]Clown OST.
[13:30.73]The first thing that comes up is the Joker movie.
[13:35.55]There's no clown OST.
[13:38.38]A clown doesn't have a CD that he puts in when he goes and does balloon animals at your house.
[13:42.96]By the way, I got a like.
[13:45.12]I'm going to get a little closer to this microphone so you can hear me.
[13:47.16]We've got to change where the webcam is too.
[13:49.64]Alright, there we go.
[13:51.40]What's... Clown OST.
[13:54.45]I don't get it.
[14:00.17]I'm not putting on the Joker.
[14:01.57]I haven't seen that movie.
[14:04.19]Play clown music.
[14:06.95]I don't even know what you taught- what is that even supposed to mean?
[14:09.35]Clown mu- one hour of- I'm not putting- no.
[14:13.49]Circus theme song for ten hours.
[14:15.17]Is this even lined up?
[14:18.43]Really?
[14:20.97]I gotta get out of the way so you can see the whole picture.
[14:29.52]Do it.
[14:31.34]I don't wanna just put on fucking clown music.
[14:38.56]No, I'm not gonna keep this on.
[14:41.16]This is fucking stupid.
[14:43.20]How about just like... One hour of scary clown music.
[14:47.93]One hour of creepy clown music.
[14:56.37]45 minutes of classic circus music.
[14:58.99]I think I've already played this.
[15:02.46]Yeah.
[15:04.12]Yeah, I've played this before.
[15:10.33]Okay, I'm gonna do this as long as I can possibly handle this, but that's it.
[15:14.65]But this is fantastic, though.
[15:15.67]Nice work.
[15:20.63]Ah, this is scary.
[15:23.19]It's me.
[15:23.51]It looks like I've got a knife in my hand.
[15:30.43]I... Why is it happening twice again?
[15:35.99]Why is this happening?
[15:36.98]I changed my thing.
[15:40.64]That's... Hello?
[15:42.48]What the fuck?
[15:46.44]Okay, hold on.
[15:48.28]Here we go.
[15:53.44]There we are.
[15:54.92]Now we got some real clown music going.
[15:59.55]I like the knife.
[16:00.29]I like the knife work that you've got here.
[16:07.07]We can't hear it.
[16:10.30]Yes, you can.
[16:14.54]What's going on up here?
[16:15.35]Is this blood?
[16:16.83]Oh, I, I, why?
[16:17.99]How do I not know?
[16:18.65]This is the spy.
[16:19.59]That's Your Eternal Reward.
[16:20.77]How do I not know this?
[16:24.26]It was disguised.
[16:25.10]Okay.
[16:26.30]I don't know why I'm so fucking dumb.
[16:29.56]I'm a fool, I know.
[16:31.91]Uh, this was, uh, somebody had a birthday?
[16:34.79]Or somebody had a... Um, somebody had a... There was a baby involved or something?
[16:39.83]There was a baby reveal?
[16:41.15]I don't know.
[16:46.12]But this is a... That's a joke?
[16:47.50]Wait, that's from the... I don't... I haven't seen the movie!
[16:57.82]This is a Joker game?
[16:58.82]Game?! !
[17:02.69]This is a good image.
[17:03.61]Hey, look.
[17:03.99]Those of you that don't know, I don't wear two headphones.
[17:13.40]Because when I cover both my ears, I don't know where I am.
[17:17.10]And it fucks with my spatial awareness.
[17:19.84]See, I can't hear myself talk right now.
[17:22.10]And me not being able to hear myself talk right now is being drowned out by clown music.
[17:27.27]So, it's like when a vacuum cleaner's on and you're talking.
[17:32.09]I can't do it.
[17:33.09]I can't do it.
[17:33.49]I have to be able to hear.
[17:34.13]I have to be able to hear and sense the surroundings.
[17:36.94]Otherwise, I lose my mind.
[17:40.54]But no, this is pretty accurate.
[17:42.58]Yo, that's the old hair too.
[17:44.82]Alright.
[17:45.92]One in the chat if you want me to go back to short, free Vegas hair.
[17:50.45]Two in the chat if you want me to let this grow and don't cut it for at least three years.
[18:04.81]Eh.
[18:06.17]I've seen a lot of ones.
[18:10.08]Or three is Shave It Off.
[18:13.44]I can't listen to that song a fourth time.
[18:15.22]I'm sorry.
[18:15.64]We have to put something else on.
[18:20.22]Yoshi's... What was it?
[18:21.04]Yoshi's Story?
[18:21.82]We keep going.
[18:22.66]We always go back to Yoshi's Island.
[18:27.88]Do a poll?
[18:28.84]No, no, no, I'm not going to be like, oh, should I cut my hair?
[18:31.38]Should I dye it fucking orange?
[18:33.38]Or should I cut it off?
[18:34.92]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:36.02]I'm going to decide what I... Cut my finger, by the way, today.
[18:38.66]Of course you see that.
[18:41.17]Do a mohawk?
[18:42.05]No.
[18:45.91]Why did you ask?
[18:49.27]I just, I was just seeing what people thought.
[18:53.82]I said, hey, one-inch hat if you think.
[18:55.84]Two-inch hat if you think.
[18:57.75]It's what I think, though, because it's my hair.
[19:00.05]I was just curious to see how many people would be angry with it.
[19:09.24]Jerma doesn't think.
[19:12.10]Alright, we're gonna do Yoshi's story.
[19:15.72]What's the one for Nintendo 64 where they sing like little kids?
[19:18.90]They go... Where is it?
[19:23.24]It's horrendous.
[19:25.20]Here it comes.
[19:28.25]I remember playing this when I was younger.
[19:30.25]When I say younger, it wasn't that long ago, but it was.
[19:34.23]And it's this ear-piercing like... I'm telling you, it's horrible.
[19:39.51]Where is it?
[19:42.64]No.
[19:43.86]Not this one.
[19:48.88]Where is it?
[19:51.00]Then they say, the end.
[19:54.62]The end of... The end of... Like, it's the end of the story.
[20:02.28]What's it called?
[20:14.84]How come I can't find it?
[20:18.44]On the beach.
[20:19.61]Love is in the air.
[20:20.47]Tough guys don't cry.
[20:22.77]What's that one?
[20:31.17]It's the rat.
[20:36.76]Found in the sewer.
[20:38.50]A small enemy spider.
[20:42.54]That's supposed to be me?
[20:46.62]Chat is a cutie.
[20:48.27]Is this supposed to be you?
[20:51.19]The garbage filth baby arms are because I drew on one layer unintentionally.
[20:56.29]Didn't want to start over like a dum-dum.
[20:59.25]What's wrong with it?
[20:59.85]It's fine.
[21:02.81]What's wrong with it?
[21:03.25]It looks good.
[21:03.64]I think it looks good.
[21:12.18]Trust no one, not even yourself.
[21:20.21]This is just my regular clothes.
[21:26.03]I wear like the same three superhero shirts and then like a few, a handful of Star Wars shirts.
[21:35.55]Jax has a way better fashion sense as you can see.
[21:39.14]He's got a Nightwing shirt on.
[21:40.52]That's it.
[21:42.38]Wow.
[21:44.16]Also a superhero shirt.
[21:48.82]Do I have any real clothes?
[21:50.74]I do, but they just all, okay.
[21:53.72]I have real clothes, but they're all hung up in a, on hangers, and I don't ever take them off the hangers.
[22:00.25]Because it's way easier just to put a t-shirt on than it is to like put a button-up shirt with like a tie on.
[22:09.13]Prove it.
[22:10.77]Prove that I have real clothes?
[22:16.28]No, it has nothing to do with going to Reddit.
[22:18.61]It has to do with... I don't... I like having... It's comfy.
[22:24.77]Do it.
[22:25.05]Let's do a fashion show.
[22:27.52]Hold that thought.
[22:28.48]We got community fucking content.
[22:30.42]Night.
[22:31.32]Although it's kind of still the day.
[22:32.82]I'll prove it.
[22:33.64]I will.
[22:35.03]Life imitates art.
[22:47.63]It sure does.
[22:48.23]Jerma and Jex.
[22:53.58]Two pretty cool dudes here.
[22:54.80]Is this it?
[22:58.70]Nope.
[23:07.15]I thought that was going to be it.
[23:07.99]I was waiting for it.
[23:08.63]Well, there's Jex and Jerma.
[23:11.41]We're both not the same person.
[23:12.97]We both have different... We're both different people, I guess.
[23:16.78]I skipped it already.
[23:17.78]How is that even possible?
[23:20.74]By the way, take this out.
[23:21.58]I can't even hear myself talk.
[23:24.12]I need no headphones.
[23:26.33]You know, I know people that put both headphones in and pump their audio through so they hear themselves talking.
[23:32.71]I would throw up if I had to do that.
[23:34.45]I would actually throw up.
[23:36.59]Like, I would... It would never work.
[23:40.49]It would be impossible.
[23:43.11]This looks like a sticker to me.
[23:44.13]Looks very good.
[23:48.09]The big, thick outlines.
[23:49.45]I like it.
[23:52.23]I would love this on the back of a laptop.
[23:56.63]Alright.
[23:57.43]Get your laptop.
[23:58.15]I think it would look good.
[23:59.84]I think it would look good.
[24:02.64]Like a Redditor.
[24:06.62]Not everything is... You guys are on that recently.
[24:10.12]I don't understand.
[24:11.92]Not everything is based on a news aggregate website.
[24:21.37]What?
[24:22.41]How come you guys aren't like... Oh wow, that's a real CNN thing to do.
[24:26.64]Oh, wow, NBC streamer.
[24:29.41]Nice NBC room.
[24:32.17]Like, I get my news from Reddit.
[24:33.71]I like read like the headlines and see and go to articles on Reddit.
[24:38.19]That's like calling me an NBC guy.
[24:40.80]Or like a, wow, man, that's what a real NBC thing to do, huh?
[24:43.72]Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have a laptop with a sticker on it.
[24:45.62]What are you, fucking CNN?
[24:47.74]I just, I only go to Reddit for news.
[24:53.67]That explains a lot.
[24:54.65]No, it doesn't.
[24:55.44]I don't even watch TV.
[24:58.22]I don't even watch TV.
[24:59.90]I don't watch television.
[25:02.14]I don't listen to music.
[25:03.70]I'm just a fucking weirdo.
[25:04.76]I just sit in a room and stare at a wall.
[25:07.42]I just go like this.
[25:08.22]Wow.
[25:08.62]I make up my own TV shows.
[25:11.26]And my own characters.
[25:12.28]And I let them do their own things in my head.
[25:14.10]I just said that to everybody.
[25:20.43]This is pretty scary.
[25:22.96]You're a psycho?
[25:23.60]No, it's called free entertainment.
[25:27.96]I can't wait to the next episode of... Two Alligators.
[25:33.42]That's the thing I dreamed of last night.
[25:34.78]Two Alligators.
[25:36.82]You made that up.
[25:38.62]I did.
[25:38.90]I did.
[25:40.74]Yeah, good call.
[25:41.56]Good catch.
[25:49.12]Two and a half Alligators.
[25:53.51]This is scary.
[25:55.71]I like the background though.
[25:56.65]Looks good.
[26:02.92]Big screaming mouth.
[26:05.36]Look at this guy.
[26:06.00]Yeah.
[26:06.22]Why are people saying Sour Fleece?
[26:10.88]What is it?
[26:11.24]I don't want to miss out.
[26:12.88]What is it?
[26:21.04]Why are we sour-pleasing the language?
[26:22.90]Sneaking around music.
[26:24.30]That's what this is.
[26:24.92]This is the evil guy.
[26:25.94]He's sneaking around corners.
[26:27.56]This is like the... Hold on.
[26:32.70]This is this music.
[26:33.54]You ready?
[26:33.92]Like, I'm gonna come in frame. ...
[26:55.81]Where's the end?
[26:56.57]985, a story of a madman.
[27:06.60]That was another good internet clown moment.
[27:08.32]I'm not even a madman, these are all like jokes.
[27:15.64]Alright, I can't hear myself breathe.
[27:17.98]These are all, like, jokes.
[27:19.14]I'm not a madman.
[27:19.90]This is a character.
[27:21.02]This is Odd Michael.
[27:22.59]This is me crying and laughing at a fart compilation, so that's me.
[27:27.45]That's also me.
[27:30.25]Um, that's not even me.
[27:31.31]That's Jex.
[27:33.17]That's a TIE Fighter guy.
[27:34.47]That's a clown.
[27:36.03]That's not even me.
[27:36.51]That's a clown.
[27:37.14]And then this is a Ninja Turtle.
[27:40.16]So, sorry.
[27:40.64]These are all characters.
[27:44.09]What's that old saying?
[27:44.73]I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.
[27:47.15]These are characters of mine.
[27:48.43]This is not me.
[27:52.43]Socrates.
[27:53.56]You're a character.
[27:54.68]Ghost fart.
[27:58.58]Thanks for the five subs.
[28:01.42]Oh, so you're a scientist.
[28:02.64]No, I'm not a scientist.
[28:04.82]I love this.
[28:05.26]This is great.
[28:10.76]Getting defensive.
[28:12.68]Eh.
[28:14.45]Not really.
[28:20.52]He's really happy about something.
[28:21.74]And I do appreciate the big ding on the teeth.
[28:25.70]I like the ding.
[28:26.20]Whatever, I don't even know what the song is.
[28:32.30]Here's some Dunkin' Donut because you're epic.
[28:38.07]That really took off, too.
[28:39.13]Like, this Dunkin' Donuts thing...
[28:46.50]Isn't this like a meme from somebody else?
[28:48.12]This is like another meme, right?
[28:53.08]This is like... We've adapted.
[28:56.66]We've taken over and adapted the meme.
[29:01.06]Well, I didn't, but... This is a Reddit meme.
[29:06.48]No, it's not.
[29:12.69]It's not.
[29:13.05]No, it's not.
[29:13.51]It's not mine.
[29:15.36]None of this is mine.
[29:16.52]This is all yours.
[29:18.00]This is community content.
[29:19.06]I almost just burped wicked loud into the microphone.
[29:21.17]I told you how I got this cut from hummus.
[29:30.33]When you eat a lot of hummus, it can boil back up.
[29:35.51]You get gas because of all the hummus gas.
[29:39.16]I don't watch any news.
[29:44.26]No, I do.
[29:45.84]This is interesting because this person is Tony Hawk's underground and they've decided to use that.
[30:01.93]This is the image that all of us have when our parents took the picture of us on our first day of school in the first grade.
[30:12.32]In fact, I could probably ask my mother to send me the picture of this exact thing I'm talking about.
[30:18.50]Even the stance, too.
[30:21.50]The only thing is, add a backpack.
[30:26.25]Huge shoes.
[30:30.83]They are.
[30:31.33]They are fucking huge, aren't they?
[30:40.78]Oh my god.
[30:43.06]Alright, I wasn't gonna include this, but I just did anyways.
[30:46.90]I was gonna just remove this one, but... It's just, it's stupid.
[30:51.08]I just had to put it in.
[30:54.68]Here is, uh, I believe that's fireman.
[30:58.83]Clown shoes.
[31:03.57]I don't, I know everything has to be clown related.
[31:06.07]Why can everything not be clown related?
[31:12.85]EOS, what?
[31:18.02]For a second I thought it was going to be a dick and I'm like, no, this is, what are you talking about?
[31:22.44]Are links still banned?
[31:24.90]I think they are.
[31:25.48]It's a clown Reddit Jojo.
[31:32.51]Anime villain goblin face.
[31:33.87]This is from Sins.
[31:36.39]I know!
[31:37.13]I hate to say sins.
[31:42.90]Saw this last time.
[31:48.08]Fucking like this so much.
[31:49.48]It's gonna be my new profile picture.
[31:56.45]Should this just be my profile picture?
[31:58.53]I feel like that's not gonna help me though.
[32:07.33]Anywhere.
[32:07.63]It would be the other one.
[32:13.31]No.
[32:14.67]Are my eyes close together?
[32:17.05]They kind of are.
[32:21.05]Yeah, kind of, but not- No, it's because I just got a- I got a big, broken, fucked up nose.
[32:31.00]My, like, big bridge of my nose makes my eyes look closer together.
[32:34.70]If I didn't have, like, a big, like, Squidward schnoz, this- I would- I would- It would be fine.
[32:45.40]Bad music.
[32:53.80]Oh, that's why everyone was doing that emo.
[33:01.55]I thought you were saying that's what I looked like.
[33:03.49]I thought it was, yeah, you look like this character.
[33:07.03]Oh, yeah, like your eyes are too close together and your nose is too big.
[33:09.35]You look like an orc streamer.
[33:13.91]God.
[33:14.31]It's both?
[33:21.17]Hold the music for a second.
[33:22.25]We had two huge donations coming.
[33:25.32]We had 5,000 bits from West.
[33:28.24]095.
[33:29.42]They say, I forgot the message, so here's more bits.
[33:33.96]Thanks for the years of entertainment.
[33:35.05]Been watching you since I was in, like, 7th grade.
[33:37.35]That's so long.
[33:39.23]I'm so old.
[33:41.21]And I'm currently in college.
[33:42.71]God, that makes me fucking old.
[33:46.83]That makes me ancient.
[33:51.10]Thanks so much for making a lot of otherwise boring days not boring, especially in a time like this.
[33:54.78]Well, thanks for the $50.
[33:55.54]I'm incredibly happy to have raised you, my son.
[34:02.91]You're in the seventh grade.
[34:10.69]Get all off to college.
[34:13.15]He's such a big boy now.
[34:19.00]But seriously, thank you.
[34:20.68]Thanks for the $50.
[34:22.32]Thanks for watching for that long.
[34:25.60]We also had another 5,000 bits come in.
[34:28.50]$50 from Big Boy Buzz.
[34:29.85]He's gotten so big.
[34:32.69]My big boy.
[34:33.49]I didn't even read that.
[34:34.83]A big boy Eggo.
[34:37.77]Jerma, your streams mean a whole lot to me and have made me smile during some really harsh times.
[34:42.25]Hope you're doing well, and I hope you have a nice day.
[34:44.43]Also, please make a sequel to Demon Lord at Freddy's.
[34:51.68]I can't adhere to that request.
[34:53.08]That's, that's such, I can't do that.
[34:57.92]I can't.
[35:00.02]I can't.
[35:00.56]That's like, that's, I know people say, Jerma, that video's not even that bad, you're overreacting.
[35:05.99]I know, but they'll never, no.
[35:12.91]Need to return that money then.
[35:18.98]No, all sales are final.
[35:22.10]All sales are final.
[35:24.30]Speaking of sales, thanks, Super Bruce.
[35:26.24]Oh, Super Bruce, Super Frog Bruce.
[35:29.36]Thanks for the five community subs.
[35:32.48]Is that written down anywhere, by the way?
[35:33.76]Do I say all sales are final anywhere?
[35:35.94]I probably should.
[35:41.54]But, anyways.
[35:42.63]That's $50 from two different people.
[35:44.73]Thank you, West, and thank you, Big Boy.
[35:46.21]Both of you.
[35:47.59]And thanks, SuperFrog, for those five community subs.
[35:51.39]Let's keep going.
[35:53.35]Let's put that fucking music back on.
[35:55.45]Can I find the end thing?
[35:58.41]Is this it?
[36:03.04]Guys, I think they... I think they omitted this because it was so annoying.
[36:14.44]Yoshi's Story, the end.
[36:15.92]It's not on here.
[36:23.85]No, they removed it.
[36:24.87]Nobody has it anywhere.
[36:27.87]The end of...
[36:32.24]End credits music?
[36:35.32]No, it's been removed.
[36:39.98]Uh, somebody, another 10 subs.
[36:41.58]Harold Elbertson, 985.
[36:43.34]Thanks, thanks, thanks, me.
[36:45.45]For the 10 community subs.
[36:48.69]Thank you, Harold.
[36:53.21]That's 10 subs.
[36:54.27]Where the fuck is this?
[36:56.67]A book opens, it's, it's, it's the intro.
[36:58.95]I had the right song?
[37:03.66]No, it's not.
[37:21.41]Whatever, I have no idea.
[37:24.51]I can't stop worrying about the song.
[37:27.01]This fucking picture.
[37:27.89]Look at this shit.
[37:28.79]Look at how... This is fucking... I want to be this.
[37:33.09]I want to be this.
[37:34.27]So bad.
[37:38.33]Officer Jack's Space Police.
[37:42.37]This is so detailed.
[37:44.17]Big... I cannot be.
[37:56.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:58.02]I don't want to talk about that.
[37:59.32]That's just...
[38:04.52]Let's zoom in on that face for a minute here.
[38:11.14]I love this, though.
[38:11.94]This is fucking fantastic.
[38:16.12]Look at here.
[38:17.16]You've even got the Nightwing.
[38:20.38]You've just successfully, besides that part, I mean, you've just successfully made a cool Nightwing.
[38:29.41]This is just Nightwing, but cool.
[38:31.27]Nightwing is cool, but this is a cool Nightwing.
[38:39.25]It's incredibly detailed, yeah.
[38:42.59]This is fantastic.
[38:47.14]We got... I like that face a lot.
[38:51.66]This is like how I feel when I play Animal Crossing.
[38:54.32]This exact image.
[38:55.42]You know what I mean?
[38:59.51]Like, anybody else feel like that?
[39:00.79]I do.
[39:06.45]Looks great, thank you.
[39:09.61]I hear he's an okay streamer.
[39:11.03]This is from, I believe... Oh, is it WarioWare?
[39:15.01]There are you guys.
[39:18.69]That's me.
[39:23.28]Yoshi's Happy Song, please.
[39:25.10]Is that what it's called?
[39:25.90]Rhythm Heaven?
[39:30.62]There's no way.
[39:31.88]Oh, well, whatever.
[39:32.90]I thought this was not WarioWare?
[39:38.69]Oh, yeah, it's a rhythm happening.
[39:39.61]You're right.
[39:39.89]I fucking hate this picture.
[39:51.32]Why would I?
[39:52.30]Oh, it's so bad.
[39:53.18]It's just... Like, my skin is so blotchy and...
[40:06.44]I feel like I'm sweating.
[40:07.52]My hair's really greasy and stuff.
[40:09.16]That looks just bad.
[40:11.92]I hate this fucking picture.
[40:13.35]You guys don't know that.
[40:14.21]I mean, you do, but you don't.
[40:16.67]Like, I really, really don't like this picture.
[40:20.87]I hate it.
[40:22.09]Look at how many images exist of my face doing something fucking weird.
[40:26.16]This is the only one that I truly don't like.
[40:28.40]I truly hate this picture.
[40:30.98]Truly.
[40:31.50]Not even making a joke.
[40:32.50]Like, no fucking around.
[40:34.12]I hate this photo.
[40:40.52]Every time I see it, I'm just like, oh, it's so fucking gross and shitty.
[40:48.26]I know this life.
[40:50.33]This is me trying to be chili, fast chilies.
[41:01.29]It wasn't fucking completable.
[41:05.11]It wasn't complete.
[41:05.99]This is making me want to click this.
[41:09.67]Happy Yoshi's song.
[41:11.01]Yoshi's happy song.
[41:16.90]Where is it?
[41:17.82]I just typed in happy Yoshi.
[41:20.70]Happy Yoshi's song.
[41:23.46]Yoshi's happy song.
[41:25.28]Is this it?
[41:25.68]This is it.
[41:28.63]This is it.
[41:29.03]You ready?
[41:43.03]So I had... What?
[41:46.31]Eat what?
[42:10.44]Not even fucking close.
[42:11.96]You jokers.
[42:14.00]You jokesters.
[42:15.54]Not even fucking close.
[42:17.06]Not even close.
[42:21.01]I was gonna give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.
[42:23.31]Not even close.
[42:24.67]Not even remotely close.
[42:26.75]Alright, how about, uh... What are the OSD?
[42:31.85]It's literally the same.
[42:33.17]No, it's not.
[42:35.62]E...
[42:39.54]No, you're stretching so far.
[42:43.90]I can hear the first part.
[42:45.46]But the... No, sorry.
[42:53.13]No, you're not even close.
[42:54.69]I'm not going to give that one to you.
[42:55.47]This is... The Six Stages of Fireman.
[43:06.79]We have the six stages of fireman.
[43:09.51]Confusion.
[43:12.23]Confusion.
[43:13.33]Confusion.
[43:14.13]Insanity.
[43:15.51]Lust.
[43:16.83]Depression.
[43:20.85]Wistfulness.
[43:22.03]And suave.
[43:23.22]The six stages of fireman.
[43:29.90]This is great, though.
[43:35.04]How do you get it to look like this?
[43:36.92]That's what I want to know.
[43:40.36]How do you get the eyes to look like that?
[43:47.56]Like the shiny eyes, they look like they're coming out.
[43:51.04]They're bulging.
[43:53.56]What is that technique?
[43:54.60]It's a shading technique.
[43:56.11]It looks insane.
[43:57.65]It's called talent.
[43:58.99]Maybe I should find some.
[43:59.93]Is that what you were going to say next?
[44:05.57]Even if that person is down, that's not what they were going to say next.
[44:08.38]I predicted that's what they were going to say.
[44:09.68]So ban them.
[44:13.83]You're a big rat.
[44:14.77]For you.
[44:15.15]I don't know why I put this one in.
[44:19.12]I don't know.
[44:19.86]I just... Okay, I know I've said that not every submission is guaranteed to get in.
[44:27.58]There's a lot of submissions.
[44:29.88]I don't put them all in.
[44:31.28]And then some people are like, why did you fucking put this in then?
[44:33.88]It's like, I don't know.
[44:35.28]I don't know.
[44:36.56]I don't know.
[44:37.28]I just did.
[44:37.92]I just was like, oh, this one.
[44:39.85]I don't know.
[44:40.31]I don't know.
[44:40.93]Some of them go in.
[44:44.19]I, I try.
[44:44.91]Oh, look at it.
[44:47.85]He ate so much honey.
[44:50.82]What is that?
[44:51.22]Mustard?
[44:52.78]What is that?
[44:53.16]No, it's cheese.
[44:59.28]Because he's a fucking rat.
[45:06.06]Thank you, Mr. Spicy Dude.
[45:11.34]I don't know, the only time you ever see, like, yellow like that is in Winnie the Pooh when he, like, stuffs his hand inside and puts it all over his face.
[45:17.14]No, I don't want to control W. He drank Jurati.
[45:39.69]What?
[45:45.44]This one's not much more sane.
[45:48.22]I just... I don't know.
[45:53.58]It's fucked up.
[45:56.44]And I don't know why I have the rat in a bottle like that.
[45:58.94]It was relevant because it was like the crack streams from the last day or two.
[46:05.69]Why is he screwed in here?
[46:13.14]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[46:16.07]What, what happened?
[46:16.95]What was it?
[46:18.11]What?
[46:18.89]What was it?
[46:19.39]What happened?
[46:20.03]What was it?
[46:20.51]Is there a dick or something?
[46:23.57]Is there a dick on camera?
[46:31.48]Skip it, skip it.
[46:32.32]I don't... It's just me.
[46:33.74]I don't... What?
[46:36.32]Bottom right, bottom right.
[46:37.32]There's no dick on the bottom right.
[46:39.80]It's just like, I have a rat.
[46:41.24]Like, I don't know, like...
[46:43.98]The Fraggles used to do this shit in Fraggle Rock.
[46:46.31]The guy that used to catch the Fraggles.
[46:48.07]What is this?
[46:54.49]Bottom right.
[47:01.21]Funny.
[47:03.31]I don't get it.
[47:03.75]What happened?
[47:05.05]Look at how cool this is.
[47:10.54]Not bottom right on you.
[47:11.48]Bottom right on my screen.
[47:15.84]Oh, here are the eight stages of Jerma.
[47:19.40]Sadness.
[47:20.82]Confusion.
[47:22.38]Pretending to know.
[47:25.04]Adequate.
[47:27.10]Sad.
[47:28.50]Anger.
[47:29.71]Acceptance.
[47:31.65]3D.
[47:34.89]There are the eight stages of Jerma985.
[47:36.47]This is awesome.
[47:48.13]I guess this is what it would be like if I was a real cartoon character.
[47:51.83]Although real and cartoon character don't.
[47:54.51]That's an oxymoron.
[47:56.01]That doesn't make any sense.
[48:00.14]What stage are you in right now?
[48:02.06]Find out.
[48:02.44]Fucking anger.
[48:11.64]Always anger.
[48:13.26]Always.
[48:17.57]Hey, this is me from Rhythm Heaven.
[48:21.53]There are no more stages.
[48:22.81]Anger only.
[48:27.38]This is beautiful.
[48:31.76]With a little golf... With a little golf guy.
[48:35.02]Oh, she just burped on you again.
[48:38.98]Put on the Outer Wilds OST.
[48:41.68]Ooh!
[48:45.86]That's a good one.
[48:47.28]That's a really good one.
[48:49.42]Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for.
[48:50.74]And I won't be listening to it.
[48:56.07]I hope it's good.
[48:57.91]Because I can't, I have to talk to you.
[49:00.75]Music fucks with my brain.
[49:02.19]I can't, like, it messes, it goes into my electrodes on my head, inside my brain.
[49:06.47]I can't, like, talk.
[49:07.87]That's why I don't listen to music.
[49:11.26]This is great, though.
[49:11.86]Okay, we have a fucking animated rat.
[49:16.99]animated rat back and forth.
[49:19.17]He's doing this way, that way, this way, that way.
[49:22.09]Come on.
[49:23.57]Please get some this way, that ways in the chat, please.
[49:26.15]Hey, any this way, that way in the chat?
[49:28.07]Oh, sorry, I'm saying it wrong.
[49:29.29]This way, that way?
[49:33.43]It's Jerma Otto, of course.
[49:37.17]Good heavens, would you look at the time?
[49:38.43]This is the Lord of the Rings video game.
[49:43.24]The ladder mission.
[49:45.00]I just thought it was funny.
[49:49.37]Oh, no, that's what's on the screen.
[49:56.57]Right.
[50:03.70]It's... I don't know.
[50:04.82]It just made me laugh.
[50:07.68]Here's your criteria for how to get on community content night.
[50:11.42]Did I open this and go... That's it.
[50:15.60]Or did I open this and go...
[50:18.49]Or did I open this and go... Or... Huh?
[50:23.55]As long as I hit one of the eight stages of fucking... Jerma grief.
[50:26.54]Whatever it is.
[50:27.02]Eight stages of Gerber baby.
[50:30.02]As long as I turn into a Gerber baby on stream.
[50:31.88]That's how you know.
[50:34.42]The eight stages of Gerber baby.
[50:38.29]That is... I just explained to you what they were.
[50:40.19]I just... That's all baby.
[50:42.32]Sad, confusion, anger, 3D.
[50:46.00]There are no other baby emotions.
[50:56.69]Jex is back for another round in Jex Reloaded.
[51:02.97]Jeremy Elbertson and Willem Dafoe.
[51:07.80]Is Willem Dafoe Jex in this scenario?
[51:18.20]Why are we listening to what?
[51:27.01]There.
[51:27.33]Okay, I changed it.
[51:29.95]Compact Stream Pictures presents Loud P and Cloud Clown Car Films Willem Dafoe Film Jeremy Elbertson Stevens Why is Willem Dafoe Jex Reloaded?
[51:41.93]Music by John Williams
[51:46.03]There are more!
[51:49.31]The adventure comes to an end.
[51:52.19]This is Jex1985.
[51:53.77]Willem Dafoe is in this one too, apparently.
[52:00.50]Well, I love how Xeroxos is just in here too.
[52:10.22]Why is this the end of the stream voice?
[52:12.84]Oh, no.
[52:13.44]I think there's another one.
[52:14.93]Yeah.
[52:16.57]From the director that brought you Socrates, a JermaCraft story.
[52:21.20]Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Elberton is Jex, a JermaCraft story.
[52:39.54]okay like that this is like the if I made the thing you know like when like the YouTuber makes the movie like jex a JermaCraft story that would probably be what it was for me no one would ever give me the money to do that though no I don't think so
[53:03.32]I'm not sure.
[53:04.06]Here's the thing, guys.
[53:04.94]Anytime an investor wants to invest in film production or into a movie, they're anticipating some kind of return.
[53:12.69]I could guarantee that whatever movie that if you were an investor in my movie, you would go negative.
[53:20.25]It would not be a single return.
[53:22.83]You would just be able to watch the movie and go, oh, that was that was kind of that was alright.
[53:29.69]maybe like I could probably reliably guarantee one to two thousand downloads on iTunes like you know and then I could say you know maybe like ten thousand clicks and maybe like one to two thousand iTunes downloads and that's it it would be a flop it would be
[53:53.84]You don't think this movie would be a flop?
[53:58.00]How much money did this cost?
[54:00.43]There are 6,500 people right now.
[54:02.11]If every single person here watched this movie 50 times, that wouldn't even scratch the surface of the last Adam Sandler movie that released on Netflix.
[54:13.40]It would be like one hour of revenue from the latest Adam Sandler movie.
[54:20.17]I don't think it would turn out alright.
[54:21.47]I like it.
[54:21.79]This one made me laugh.
[54:23.49]Hey, Fred.
[54:24.19]Hey, Fred.
[54:25.27]Did you know there are a bunch of cavemen in the car?
[54:28.93]Honey, shut the fuck up.
[54:32.82]Something like that, right?
[54:39.20]This is not horny.
[54:40.40]It better not be.
[54:44.96]Why was he burning?
[54:45.62]What do you mean burning?
[54:48.37]Hey, Fred.
[54:49.43]Did you know there's a bunch of cavemen in the car?
[54:51.93]That's not everybody's Bernie Sanders, guys.
[54:56.09]Hey, Fred.
[54:56.87]Hey, Fred.
[54:57.49]Hey, Fred.
[54:58.34]Hey, Fred.
[54:58.82]Did you know that the banks... Okay, it could be.
[55:02.12]It needs a little bit more.
[55:02.92]It needs a little bit more Bernie pog on it.
[55:05.24]I can see it.
[55:05.84]This is just cute.
[55:09.30]That would probably hurt.
[55:18.49]You're literally on fire.
[55:19.77]I mean, kind of.
[55:21.57]Not literally.
[55:22.37]You've got the hair pretty good, too.
[55:28.79]And you've got my big, like, cheekbones and my, like, fucking eye sink.
[55:34.41]Right?
[55:40.23]Right?
[55:43.02]egomaniac.
[55:43.76]I didn't say, and that makes me fucking irresistible.
[55:48.60]No, I just said that you got my face good.
[55:53.85]But... You know... I didn't even have to...
[56:22.30]I'm not the Joker.
[56:23.13]I'm the Riddler.
[56:25.57]And I know.
[56:25.95]We've gone over this before.
[56:27.27]Everyone that says they're the Riddler is the Joker.
[56:30.26]And everyone that says they're the Joker is Robin.
[56:33.24]I know.
[56:33.64]I get it.
[56:35.00]Trust me.
[56:35.34]We've talked about it.
[56:52.88]But I wasn't crying on that one.
[57:01.27]I wasn't crying.
[57:04.48]I was not crying.
[57:05.60]I was just... I was just stage... I was stage five.
[57:10.82]Confused.
[57:27.34]Change the world.
[57:29.96]I don't know.
[57:30.34]What is this?
[57:31.54]Goodbye.
[57:37.10]My message.
[57:38.32]Change, change, change.
[57:39.32]What?
[57:39.48]What?
[57:39.88]What?
[57:40.12]Do I need the... Okay.
[57:42.21]Do I need some screening?
[57:43.75]Do I need screening on these?
[57:46.59]Have I gotten to the point where I need these to be screened?
[57:52.55]Yes.
[57:52.95]Fuck.
[57:57.65]This is from the... Take a picture of your face with your iPhone and everyone looks like that.
[58:01.25]Yeah.
[58:02.15]What's this, though?
[58:03.73]What's the whole Doug here?
[58:05.33]Is that a Game Boy?
[58:15.70]Oh, that's Hidden Folk.
[58:18.60]Oh, right, right, right.
[58:24.95]This one's just... This one's the kiss...
[58:32.31]This is the kiss.
[58:33.17]Is there any music playing?
[58:34.25]Why does it look like there's no music?
[58:41.17]That's very clever.
[58:47.77]Well, let's get some up- Let's get something upbeat.
[58:51.76]Something upbeat, but still relatively smooth and calm.
[58:57.52]What's another one that's smooth and calm, but upbeat at the same time?
[59:01.98]Mario Galaxy.
[59:03.14]Oh, yeah.
[59:03.64]Let's go.
[59:04.06]Mario Galaxy OST.
[59:08.49]Oh, yeah.
[59:16.11]Perfect.
[59:21.10]This is empty.
[59:21.96]And it's annoying me.
[59:23.02]This is annoying to me.
[59:25.98]You know what I would love to install in this room?
[59:29.54]It's like a fucking spigot.
[59:31.00]That is connected to, like, high sea fruit juice shit.
[59:35.56]Like, it's connected to the ceiling, and there's a pipe that goes all the way, like, around into the fridge.
[59:40.32]And it's just the high sea, like, red juice is just filled in a big bucket.
[59:46.07]And there's a little spigot that comes down right here.
[59:48.55]Like, literally right there.
[59:50.05]And I can just go over here and just go... And fill it up with high sea fruit punch.
[60:00.54]That's a hamster.
[60:02.72]Okay, and have you noticed how just... How well that works?
[60:08.28]If I had... Don't even give me this bullshit.
[60:10.59]If you guys had a hamster feeder in your room, you wouldn't use it?
[60:15.05]It wouldn't be something that you did every day?
[60:17.72]If you were able to just- there was a big thing right there that just always, always gave you never-ending liquid and food.
[60:27.55]I would be okay with this.
[60:29.71]If it turned out that I was just- I was just in like- I was a hamster and there was somebody just feeding me fucking just huge water, I would be like, oh shit, this is free.
[60:38.91]This is awesome.
[60:41.67]Reddit, you're a Reddit hamster manchild.
[60:46.52]Okay, if there was a never-ending supply of water and food right there, huge!
[60:52.62]And all I had to do was go like...
[60:56.57]Wow, it's fucking never-ending!
[60:59.35]And so, and every like, every like few days, a huge hand comes in, and just like, unscrews the fucking thing.
[61:06.40]And then I see another huge hand put it back, and it's just like, I didn't have to do shit!
[61:11.04]I didn't have to do anything!
[61:13.22]You just brought, you gave that to me.
[61:15.72]Oh, let's get another free refill, man!
[61:21.07]You're lazy.
[61:23.35]This is weird, weird, weird.
[61:24.70]What do you mean weird?
[61:25.68]How is this weird?
[61:26.58]This is a... What?
[61:27.76]This is... Why are you doing this?
[61:34.50]This is a... This is a... This is a creepy fetish.
[61:39.44]What?
[61:40.72]No.
[61:41.00]I just wanted... I just thought it would be cool to have this stuff for free.
[61:46.77]Like a never-ending water.
[61:50.43]I just wanted to be like the hamster.
[61:52.29]Is that... What?
[61:53.21]I just wanted to have a big... Alright.
[61:59.95]You know how you can get the water jugs with the water cooler thing?
[62:03.41]A water cooler.
[62:04.06]You can get one of those.
[62:05.24]Imagine if the water cooler was a hundred times the size and it was connected to your garage.
[62:11.58]What's so wrong with that?
[62:14.32]What's wrong with that?
[62:18.79]Would you rather have a place to put your car in your garage or a big water jug that was like 6,000 gallons?
[62:24.29]I don't understand what the problem is.
[62:28.47]This is cool though.
[62:29.14]Nice image.
[62:34.30]This is great.
[62:35.00]I love this one too.
[62:36.48]Auto in the baby carrier.
[62:40.10]You mean tap water?
[62:41.10]No, no.
[62:41.54]Like purified, clean, super quadruple osmosis.
[62:49.21]And then cleaned and then put through another filter.
[62:52.43]Triple water.
[62:54.39]Not tap water.
[62:55.23]No.
[62:56.71]You guys always make fun of boomers.
[62:58.39]Boomers drink tap water.
[63:00.27]That's like a boomer thing.
[63:02.37]I'll take that tap water from the sink.
[63:05.81]That's a boomer thing.
[63:07.75]You guys have more in common than you think.
[63:14.62]Yes, it is.
[63:15.90]You know how I know that?
[63:17.50]Because my grandmother used to have friends over to play bridge.
[63:21.96]And that's where this voice comes from, by the way.
[63:25.18]This is just me doing an imitation of my grandmother.
[63:28.48]This is exactly how my grandmother used to talk.
[63:31.82]This is her exact voice.
[63:34.21]So they would come over, and all of them would drink tap water.
[63:37.85]They'd be like, oh, do you want something to drink?
[63:40.39]Yeah, I'll drink tap water.
[63:42.05]It's fine.
[63:43.69]They would all line up and... I mean, we had... We had sodas.
[63:49.64]We had bottles.
[63:51.08]We had all kinds of... We had, like, juice.
[63:52.86]We had orange juice.
[63:54.32]We had fucking... There were, like, beers.
[63:57.36]No, just tap water's fine.
[64:02.80]It's cute.
[64:05.50]They are zoomers, Jerma.
[64:08.14]water equals boomer no I'm telling you drinking tap water out of like the kitchen sink that's a boomers love that you're a furry how does this make me a furry no not I don't drinking tap water makes me a furry
[64:35.88]This is fantastic, though.
[64:37.23]I love this.
[64:37.83]And I love coffee, too.
[64:40.79]I should just get one of these mugs.
[64:47.07]You are purring.
[64:55.66]Motherfuckers.
[64:57.62]You motherfuckers.
[65:00.55]Because I was doing the water sound.
[65:02.67]Whatever.
[65:09.26]Someone's gonna use that and put it somewhere that I- just how I feel every day.
[65:16.90]Everybody else, get up in the morning, look in the mirror, and this is what you see.
[65:22.39]That's just how I feel when I get- when I'm looking in the mirror in the morning, this is just what I feel.
[65:28.51]Just like- But look at- you've got the- ugh.
[65:41.68]Butthead.
[65:42.90]From Beavis and Butthead.
[65:49.28]Yes, I'm coming to the realization now that I am the combination of both Beavis and Butthead.
[65:57.03]I know.
[65:57.31]I laugh at everything.
[66:09.81]I think the dumbest shit is cool.
[66:12.35]I look like that.
[66:14.19]I know.
[66:14.67]I'm both Beavis and Butthead.

[69:15.50]These hairs on these sideburn hairs, when they stick out, you just look fucking 100 years old.
[69:47.30]You're losing it.
[69:47.88]No, I'm not.
[69:48.26]That's real.
[69:50.34]It was literally the same.
[69:51.28]No, it wasn't.
[69:51.96]It was these sideburn hairs.
[69:53.74]Look at that.
[69:55.64]That increases my age by 10 years by doing this.
[70:01.62]Look.
[70:06.56]I just reduced my age by 10 years.
[70:10.76]You're so self-conscious.
[70:14.65]No, I'm self-awareness.
[70:20.01]Just close these down and you'll look like fucking 20 again.
[70:28.33]You are too self-conscious.
[70:29.91]No, I'm not.
[70:33.02]I just showed my sideburn hair to 6,500 people.
[70:36.04]That's not self-conscious.
[70:37.52]Look at me.
[70:40.10]I believe that's Joel.
[70:43.06]Self-conscious would be like, holy shit, I don't like this.
[70:45.22]Therefore, you'll never see me again.
[70:46.85]No, we're on.
[70:56.52]I remember this.
[70:57.07]This was, uh, this was bad.
[71:00.81]God of War, you motherfucker.
[71:04.57]Yeah.
[71:05.97]Yeah.
[71:07.01]Remember, you have a weird anxiety about social perception.
[71:11.36]I don't think so.
[71:16.74]Hold on.
[71:17.56]Um.
[71:21.40]Let's test that hypothesis.
[71:22.66]Okay.
[71:29.11]Anything interesting written in the chat?
[71:51.34]I think I saw... No, no, nothing.
[71:55.27]I don't think so.
[71:58.21]I didn't see anything about the potential of huge zits that I could have on my forehead.
[72:04.01]Why would anybody write that?
[72:06.15]What an odd social perception that I have.
[72:11.81]I don't want to hear music.
[72:16.17]He's ugly!
[72:20.24]It's a collection of zits.
[72:22.36]No, it's two.
[72:23.14]I don't care.
[72:27.33]Ugly.
[72:28.31]I think I'm beautiful.
[72:30.61]That's all that matters.
[72:41.38]Here's some go-go squeezy.

[73:18.22]It's baby food.
[73:18.82]It's a streamer food.
[73:19.54]And people like to call me crazy for it, but that's fine.
[73:22.50]This was prefaced by saying, Jerma, please play The Sims 1.
[73:36.09]Maybe one day.
[73:40.99]I'll be taking that one.
[73:43.91]Look at this shit.
[73:48.66]oh I love this it's so good it's so detailed this is a great poster take a look make sure you show who did it he's an actual demon I want to get like a bunch of big coins
[74:14.72]Where can I get, like, a big, heavy, like, minted, good, just real, like, coin?
[74:22.56]Like a silver coin.
[74:23.66]I feel like just holding them and moving around.
[74:26.20]Just forge one yourself.
[74:27.98]Go to the bank?
[74:30.74]So if I walk into the bank and I say, what's the biggest coin you guys have here?
[74:34.46]What are they going to say?
[74:41.42]Was it a half dollar?
[74:46.09]Go to Etsy.
[74:47.41]Yeah, but I want it to be, is an Etsy coin fake?
[74:51.07]It's not like real tender.
[74:53.63]You know what I'm annoyed with?
[74:55.55]Why on Earth over the years did I not listen to those commercials that were on always at 2 to 4 o'clock in the morning?
[75:05.55]And this, never before minted, Gold Rhino.
[75:10.67]Only $19.99.
[75:11.79]Two for the price of one.
[75:14.03]Why did I not get a bunch of those?
[75:17.96]This 1917 Golden Rhino was only available for three days.
[75:24.68]Until now.
[75:26.02]We allowed four collectors into the vault to find this one piece.
[75:30.90]And it can be yours for a limited time only.
[75:33.98]The first 1,000 callers will get access to the Golden 1916 Rhino.
[75:41.08]By the way, even if 10,000 people call, you'll all get one.
[75:45.74]This is a way to make old people think they have to hurry the fuck to the telephone to call as soon as possible.
[75:51.81]But by the way, the 800 number will stay the same over the course of 16 weeks that this commercial airs.
[75:59.33]Hurry, get to a phone line now and reserve your 1917 Golden Rhino.
[76:05.28]I wish I did.
[76:08.96]Why didn't I do that?
[76:13.24]I want those now.
[76:17.32]And they were huge.
[76:18.04]They were like this big.
[76:19.68]There was a 1917 golden rhino that was this fucking big.
[76:25.56]Like, if you... You'd break your thumb and it would hurt.
[76:28.84]And you have to be careful.
[76:31.56]You could break a cheekbone with that thing.
[76:33.52]I want one.
[76:39.59]This is penis music.
[76:54.55]Anyways, I want like a big heavy coin.
[76:57.65]I know, like, what do you think you are, two-faced?
[76:59.37]Like, no, I just think I want them.
[77:02.97]I don't care what they are.
[77:03.89]I'll just, I want one.

[88:46.57]Why would spray painting a Wii damage it?
[88:48.07]Would it?
[88:50.15]If I cover the vents, cover the holes, and then spray paint it gold, who cares?
[88:57.33]Oh, the vent.

[89:06.16]Unscrew the plastic first.
[89:07.92]Yeah.

[89:35.50]But I could have showcased it again.
[89:36.70]Everybody loves Murius.
[89:41.64]How could you not like Murius?
[89:43.32]That's my question.
[89:49.69]That's not the name of this.
[89:51.59]The name of this cow is Murius.
[89:55.33]Because...
[89:57.00]Furious is curious, but also furious.
[90:01.13]It's so good.
[90:02.15]Like, it's such a good name.
[90:03.95]You guys are using, like, a meme name that is, like, apparently fucked up.
[90:24.42]Not the cow's name.
[90:26.34]That's not the cow's name.
[90:28.24]This is a great image, but that's not the cow's name.
[90:30.22]The cow's name is Murius.
[90:32.74]Change it.
[90:33.32]I... Okay.

[90:57.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[91:03.49]This is a very, very good image.
[91:08.65]It's great.
[91:12.52]What was the messed up name he's talking about?
[91:16.10]Don't.
[91:16.80]Just don't tell them.
[91:17.98]Because, like, I don't want to be the reason why that person starts searching shit.
[91:22.42]I, like, I don't, the stream is not going to be, like, a place for people to, like, oh, hey, let's talk about, like, fucking weird shit.
[91:33.40]Oh, alright, whatever.
[91:34.26]Don't Google anything.
[91:37.30]Don't Google anything.
[91:38.10]Ever.
[91:44.08]Here's the thing.
[91:44.70]I don't know if that's my face or not.
[91:47.82]Is that me?
[91:48.76]I don't know.
[91:49.30]Is this just the poster?
[91:53.24]I think this is just the poster.
[91:54.56]I don't think that's even my face.
[92:02.84]Although that would be like... I don't know if that would make sense.
[92:04.80]That would be weird.
[92:05.75]The mouth is mine?
[92:08.05]Is it?
[92:08.29]I guess.
[92:16.56]A cast of thousands.
[92:19.78]There were thousands of people in this movie.
[92:23.65]Is this public domain?
[92:24.29]Can we watch this?
[92:29.47]Is it public domain?
[92:31.21]Let's see if it's actually me in that movie.
[92:34.96]I mean, it's not.
[92:35.62]I'm not fucking 90 fucking thousand years old.
[92:47.20]Pretty good.
[92:47.94]Pretty good.
[92:53.54]I like what you did here.
[92:57.58]You skipped the song.
[93:00.96]I did it again.
[93:02.48]Uh, this is fucking awesome, though.
[93:04.48]Mustache hair.
[93:05.18]Nice work, Bloodborne McGate.
[93:13.86]Can I go back to short hair?
[93:21.15]I don't know.
[93:24.85]Let's see what I look, I mean, I'm using this as if this is a real image of my face, but I mean, it's like, I kind of miss this.
[93:35.52]Alright, I'll do a poll.
[93:37.90]Alright, this is a poll.
[94:12.34]Okay.
[94:17.18]What do you think?
[94:25.30]Flip your coin.
[94:26.18]I don't have one yet.
[94:26.92]Okay.
[94:36.32]Wow, this is getting a lot of votes.
[94:41.94]Okay, nice.
[94:43.20]Thousand votes.
[94:44.70]We don't break a thousand votes on these polls, ever.
[94:47.60]Ever.
[94:52.33]Alright.
[94:56.93]Buy the coin and flip it.
[94:58.03]I need to get one first.
[95:01.97]Link it again, link it again, link it.
[95:03.15]Alright, here, here, here, here.
[95:08.90]There, there, there.
[95:09.50]Look, look, look.
[95:11.46]This is going to break, like, 1,500 votes.
[95:12.98]This never happens.
[95:13.56]Okay.
[95:14.56]Almost 2,000 votes.
[95:15.44]You guys are going nuts.
[95:17.84]Alright, 10 more seconds.
[95:19.89]Gold spray paint here.
[95:42.22]Okay.
[95:43.98]And we're going back to short here.
[95:46.26]I'm glad that I put up the meme filter.
[95:48.43]We could get a real accurate statement of what people really thought would be better.
[95:56.09]Going back to short here.
[95:56.71]I was going to anyways, yeah.
[95:59.31]Thanks for the confirmation, Vicer.
[96:00.53]Appreciate it.
[96:07.37]Thanks for the vote.
[96:14.02]This is another one.
[96:15.32]It made me chuckle for some reason.
[96:16.82]I don't know why.
[96:19.77]Look, it made me chuckle.
[96:21.87]This is the BB unit.
[96:22.69]Yes.
[96:23.97]By the way, what the hell?
[96:26.45]Why?
[96:26.85]I guess that's illegal.
[96:30.95]That's illegal.
[96:32.01]The movie came out literally three years ago.
[96:36.42]It just dubbed me over.
[96:38.54]That's illegal.
[96:39.14]Never mind.
[96:39.82]Can't do that one.
[96:42.04]Uh, this is from the Cooking Mama stream.
[96:44.37]It was, uh, they made a pizza and it was a shitload of... shitload... Why do people always use this image too?
[96:52.75]It was a corn and strawberry pizza?
[96:57.77]It's a Bitcoin miner.
[97:00.32]That's false!
[97:01.20]That's fake.
[97:02.34]I don't want to push that because that's not even real.
[97:05.64]But it doesn't matter.
[97:17.40]oh perfect this is the kind of shit that you frame and put on your wall and people just assume that this is something really really interesting oh wow I wonder what that what that is that's oh put that up on your wall and I have a lot of I'm gonna walk by that and be like holy shit that's really interesting and cool to me even though I don't know what that is perfect
[97:46.31]Viewers are plummeting because of this.
[97:47.67]He didn't even talk.
[97:48.35]It's just an image of his face.
[97:58.33]This is great, though.
[97:59.11]I love it.
[98:00.37]This is very frameable.
[98:02.31]Very frameable.
[98:05.33]The music is perfect right now.
[98:13.32]Yeah, it is.
[98:16.30]These are different stances of mine, apparently.
[98:18.48]I just thought they were cool.
[98:20.60]I mean, I dream of having powers.
[98:23.61]Well, everybody does.
[98:24.29]I mean, it's just like, it's cute to me.
[98:36.22]Like, I like it.
[98:38.80]Press Z and wait.
[98:39.78]Dr. Seuss is from Chibi-Robo.
[98:44.88]My eye just, it's irritating.
[98:47.46]Okay, we're good.
[98:50.83]It's adorable.
[98:55.17]Play this again.
[98:55.95]I can't.
[98:57.43]I already did.
[98:58.49]I played it all.
[98:59.23]I beat it all.
[98:59.81]It was so good.
[99:01.53]It was awesome.
[99:07.45]Five years can go by and I can do it again.
[99:10.83]What about the sequel?
[99:11.55]Yeah, but I think you have to get a Nintendo DS, um... Oh, it's a 1920s movie camera.
[99:21.35]Uh, emulated, de-esser thing.
[99:24.71]Um, the thing, a way to play, to put it through to my computer.
[99:30.54]Just emulate it, just emulate it, just emulate it, just emulate it.
[99:35.37]Just emulate it.
[99:36.39]Just get every game for free and just emulate, dude.
[99:39.68]Just do it.
[99:40.84]What do you got?
[99:41.66]Where are you afraid?
[99:42.38]Just emulate everything.
[99:43.22]Just don't buy any games.
[99:44.46]Hey.
[99:49.77]Yes.
[99:50.99]Illegal.
[100:01.90]So what?

[100:15.78]I own it!
[100:20.51]That's a fake.
[100:22.35]You printed that.
[100:23.17]Oh yeah?
[100:28.01]What the fuck?
[100:28.93]What are all these games?
[100:34.14]New Avengers, Captain America, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Young Avengers.
[100:42.15]Who's Young Avengers?
[100:43.15]What game is that?
[100:54.66]Is that a game I can play?
[100:56.56]Did I get scammed?
[100:57.42]No, I didn't.
[100:58.30]I'm...
[101:00.21]Teacher's copy versus what they give you.
[101:05.69]I hate that image even more.
[101:06.73]It's just scary.
[101:14.82]Like, why did you animate the eyes?
[101:18.54]I love this too.
[101:21.74]It's Chibi-Robo and Fireman.
[101:24.26]Together at last.
[101:28.87]At last!
[101:34.26]Look out.
[101:35.00]It's gonna impale him.
[101:38.12]Why?
[101:38.40]What?
[101:43.18]This OST is too stressful.
[101:54.53]Fine.
[101:54.71]I'll put on fucking relaxation music.
[102:00.44]Has this channel ever been offline?
[102:03.36]lo-fi hip-hop beats to relax to this channel I think is live I think it's it's literally never been turned off that's crazy it went offline once only once holy shit how many computers do you have how many fucking computers do you have to be able to keep that going
[102:32.16]Um, relaxing?
[102:33.59]How about flute music?
[102:37.33]Mario music.
[102:40.09]This one has a dog on it.
[102:41.27]Classical music for relaxation.
[102:43.39]For chopping.
[102:45.11]Beethoven.
[102:45.71]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[102:46.49]That's chopping is the... Alright, let's try it.
[103:03.17]Did we go over how this is surgery music?
[103:08.95]I can't listen to classical music because it's surgery music?
[103:16.58]Did we ever talk about that?
[103:18.08]Have I ever gone over this?
[103:18.90]Why?
[103:23.61]I have, right?
[103:24.41]I've never gone over this?
[103:26.61]Explain, explain.
[103:29.85]Okay, so yeah, like dentist music, yeah.
[103:33.61]I had my wisdom teeth pulled.
[103:35.66]And I was kind of put under anesthesia for it.
[103:39.40]And this music was just playing.
[103:42.68]Guy just had classical music playing while he was pulling my teeth.
[103:48.02]And it was crazy because like, obviously you could, when I was getting put under the sedation, it was like, the song, it was scary.
[103:58.71]It was like going... And then it's just classical, classical, classical.
[104:07.66]This is surgery music.
[104:09.58]I've had two procedures.
[104:11.80]And this always plays.
[104:14.73]There's always like a fucking surgery song.
[104:22.35]Yeah, like this is... Like when they like get in there and...
[104:36.23]Hannibal did that.
[104:39.17]See, right?
[104:41.34]He's got a classical music phobia.
[104:50.06]And it gets angry, too.
[104:52.52]You notice how it's like boom!
[104:54.24]You can tell when he fucking pushes wicked hard down on the fucking keys.
[104:57.41]Listen, ready?
[104:59.05]It's like bang!
[105:00.87]You can hear his hands hit the bottom of the wood on the piano.
[105:06.00]Where is it?
[105:09.66]Where is it?
[105:18.55]You can feel the wood getting hit.
[105:33.90]It's angry.
[105:35.76]I don't like it.
[105:36.89]It's wonderful.
[105:39.03]It's created so magically, and the skill that it takes to be able to do that, and the concentration, and how it flows.
[105:46.35]It's like a story in a song.
[105:48.13]I get it, but I've had teeth pulled twice, and the surgery music, and that's all I can think of now.
[106:01.08]It's beautiful.
[106:04.29]Play MF DOOM.
[106:06.39]That's copyright.
[106:10.09]That's copyright.
[106:10.75]I mean, too bad.
[106:16.77]What?
[106:17.01]Hey, play copyright music.
[106:25.71]No, too bad.
[106:26.67]Okay, anything else you'd like me to do?
[106:30.28]Okay, sure.
[106:33.45]Do a movie soundtrack?
[106:34.59]Alright, how about Inception?
[106:48.66]Okay.
[106:51.82]No, this is surgery music.
[106:53.24]I don't like it.
[106:55.47]That's surgery music.
[106:56.13]I don't like it.
[106:57.72]Um.
[106:59.02]That's copyrighted.
[106:59.96]Fuck.
[107:00.38]I know.
[107:00.68]Alright.
[107:01.68]How about put on jazz?
[107:03.72]Jazz royalty free.
[107:08.12]Coffee house jazz.
[107:12.67]Okay.
[107:15.17]Go ahead and pull up to the coffee shop.
[107:20.15]Alright.
[107:22.25]Just find yourself standing in line, ready to order a nice hot cup of coffee.
[107:29.29]You got it.
[107:29.93]What's that smell?
[107:31.43]Cappuccino.
[107:32.67]Freshly brewed.
[107:34.63]You look around the coffee shop, and you look for a place to sit down.
[107:39.23]But something catches your eye.
[107:41.41]In every single available seat is a man or woman with their computer.
[107:48.19]And they may have been sitting there for two to three hours at this point.
[107:54.40]No place to sit.
[107:56.50]Just computers and typing sounds.
[107:58.90]You think to say, how long have these people been here for?
[108:06.99]And is my money worth the same as theirs?
[108:09.65]But you don't.
[108:11.65]You just walk out.
[108:13.79]God, you'd like to have a seat.
[108:16.29]But you can't.
[108:22.07]You sit down.
[108:23.87]And you figure out, how am I going to drink this coffee in this car?
[108:27.47]Gosh.
[108:28.31]You turn the engine on.
[108:30.79]Oh, what's that?
[108:31.51]You put it down in the cup holder.
[108:32.45]A little bit spilt on your hand.
[108:35.75]Dripped on the ground.
[108:38.04]Nice leather.
[108:39.76]Car's got to get detailed now.
[108:42.78]Shucks.
[108:44.24]Really would have liked to see a bad coffee show.
[108:48.40]You repeat in your head over and over again as you drive.
[108:51.36]Angry now.
[108:53.43]Coffee's supposed to relax you and slow you down.
[108:56.19]Except that's absolutely not true.
[108:58.01]Caffeine makes you speed up.
[109:00.37]Slow down.
[109:02.63]It's a red light.
[109:12.16]I don't like that music.
[109:13.18]Alright, that's better.
[109:17.16]He's not insane!
[109:25.23]Would you get the Evangelion figurines?
[109:27.88]Fucking eBay, I don't know, look them up.
[109:31.08]Irma, do funny, do funny, do funny.
[109:33.84]Why is this just like my life?
[109:38.38]Not insane.
[109:39.86]And that's the Spider-Man meme.
[109:45.51]Irma, like 35 minutes into my ass, a gnome is just sitting there.
[109:49.03]But that's out of context.
[109:51.48]We were- that's out of context, I gotta- hold on, let me defend myself on that.
[109:55.16]That's what I was talking about if I streamed my colonoscopy.
[109:59.35]And if elaborate- just elaborately, somewhere on that video, I have to like- because a colonoscopy takes like half an hour.
[110:06.41]That I just put a gnome on- in there.
[110:08.76]Like not in- not obviously not in there, but like on the screen, like there was just a gnome like going through the- colonoscopy is real boring.
[110:15.90]It's just a- it's just a tunnel.
[110:19.59]and all this it's okay it's just we're just in this guy's intestines oh there's a there's a gnome there and they just pass it this needs to be context here I'm not crazy it's context this is great
[110:54.43]Ooh, it got jazzy in here.
[111:00.00]Is this the Hulk?
[111:02.22]Um... I don't think so.
[111:04.86]A Hulk.
[111:06.00]It's green meat.
[111:09.86]It's the Grinch.
[111:10.72]It's not the Hulk.
[111:13.35]It's the Grinch?
[111:17.87]It looks great.
[111:18.79]It looks great.
[111:21.09]Love the eyes.
[111:25.93]Well, I don't know.
[111:27.47]It's Beast Boy.
[111:28.29]It's whoever you want it to be.

[116:43.43]You know, if you guys think about how passive buffs and debuffs would just hurt and life would just suck.
[116:49.53]Can you imagine if you just, all of a sudden, you did some random act or some random reason?
[116:55.02]You had a ring in your inventory that increased, like, your, like, increased your intelligence by plus five randomly.
[117:01.22]Or it could take, you know, minus five or something.
[117:03.30]That would be horrible.
[117:05.69]You'd be walking around.
[117:07.07]You'd be like driving your car and you'd get hit by the debuff.
[117:10.13]And you just wouldn't be able to drive your fucking car anymore.
[117:12.67]You'd have to- I don't know how to do this!

[123:48.99]I didn't have to pretend like... There's no way.
[123:51.59]You know what would've been funny?

[127:28.94]This really was like your grandfather when you're like, hey, grandpa, do this move.
[127:33.04]And he's like, okay, I don't know what that is, but are you sure, son?
[127:43.49]Disable auto-play.

[127:49.92]And it's like 60 videos.
[127:52.06]So I forgot.
[127:52.84]That's too bad for me.
[127:54.18]And for you, apparently, too, because you have to deal with the two.
[127:56.02]I'm sorry about that, but that's the way it is.
[127:57.34]Let's keep going.

[147:01.27]Excellent work.
[147:04.23]Joel checks the bathroom.
[147:11.97]You guys hearing something?
[147:13.63]Shake the bathroom?
[147:19.67]You guys hearing something?
[147:21.33]Shake the bathroom?
[147:29.47]That's pretty quality.
[147:36.05]What is this bath video?
[147:39.93]Only true fans know what that is.
[147:43.04]You'll find it someday.
[147:50.60]Oh, here it is.
[147:51.18]Here's the job interview one that was almost auto-played.
[147:56.26]Just imagine how this guy drank a pint of vodka.
[148:04.50]I gotta keep it like that, though.
[148:05.82]That's so fucking funny.
[148:08.64]Ugh.
[148:08.90]Is he zipped up?
[148:15.23]What?
[148:16.95]Wait, what happened?
[148:19.29]Prepares for a job interview in a locked bathroom?
[148:24.80]Or just imagine I just, like, I drank, like, fucking a pint of vodka.
[148:27.78]Am I in a bathroom?
[148:34.02]It's a mystery.
[148:34.86]What the fuck?
[148:37.03]I haven't... No, I haven't played Deus Ex.
[148:38.53]I don't know what that is.
[148:42.39]This next video could be titled Proof that Jeremy owns other shirts.
[148:47.19]I'm going to have to go get my rack of clothes.
[149:07.81]Why?
[149:08.89]What?
[149:11.09]What?
[149:13.78]Wait, that was so low?
[149:15.02]Hold on.
[149:15.36]I thought it was a deep fake.
[149:29.69]It does look like a deep fake.
[149:35.01]It does.
[149:35.47]It looks like a deep fake.
[149:37.93]Yeah, like, this is a deepfake video, but I remember filming this.
[149:48.07]What is this from?
[149:48.69]It's from, like, a Twitter video.
[149:49.89]I said Happy New Year on Twitter, like, three and a half years ago.
[149:56.10]And, wait, there's another, there's a, oh, this is the April, wait, there's more noise videos?
[150:01.54]Hey, April fools.
[150:05.20]It's a toilet, you know what I mean?
[150:08.34]What the fuck is this?
[150:25.25]Okay, so for those of you that might not, you may not have been here for a while.
[150:30.01]Um, I don't know, like four years ago, three, I don't know, it was a long time ago.
[150:33.43]I filmed this like, look at me, I'm making a joke April Fool's video, haha.
[150:37.50]Funny joke, look, April Fool's toilet, haha, like I'm making a joke, making a joke, making a pretend joke video for Twitter.
[150:45.90]And I dropped the phone in the toilet for real.
[150:48.08]I was doing this thing that I, oh, like I pretend to hit my head on the door.
[150:51.46]And I dropped the phone and it went right into the toilet for real.
[150:57.65]It was not good.
[151:03.47]Coming up next is Jerma's Funniest Home Videos.
[151:11.54]You shouldn't overthink things.
[151:13.24]Of course, underthinking is bad, too.
[151:14.99]You should think just the right amount.
[151:17.87]Am I overthinking this?
[151:18.81]What do you think?
[151:19.89]Anyway, let's check out some folks who fall in the underthink category.
[151:25.85]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[151:27.75]It's a personal best.
[151:29.86]And deadlifting, not walking.
[151:42.85]I guess this is the slip, slide, and disappear.
[151:46.05]Oh, shit!
[151:55.89]What's his degree in?
[151:58.13]Physical comedy?
[152:05.80]Some performers drop a mic.
[152:07.16]Some do this.
[152:18.78]God damn it.
[152:19.62]That was fucking perfect.
[152:21.76]Who wins?
[152:30.27]God damn it.
[152:30.79]That's so good.
[152:32.37]Here's the link.
[152:35.27]Sub performance.

[153:42.11]I'm still- Wait, why is it still driving?
[153:45.12]Ugh.

[157:08.28]This is going to scare you.
[157:10.78]Just be aware.

[164:32.98]It's said to be continued, though.
[164:36.53]Oh, that was fucking... All over the place, if I'm honest.
[164:40.81]All over the place, actually.
[164:41.75]Okay.
[164:50.24]This one, I lost my place.
[164:51.64]I accidentally just grabbed one.

[164:53.18]Where the hell are we?
[164:57.50]Okay, fuck.
[164:58.78]I accidentally just clicked and dragged.
[165:00.36]Okay, this one's called Jerm of the Razor Death Adder.
[165:10.65]Hey guys, it's me Greg from NVIDIA.
[165:13.76]Remember me?
[165:15.34]I used to be a lame-o just like you.

[165:20.11]NVIDIA Death Adder 2.7.
[165:21.23]I got a Death Adder!

[165:58.47]What do you mean nice grip?
[166:01.26]I don't understand.
[166:06.46]Is that a bad grip?
[166:13.30]That's how I grip.
[166:13.92]That's how I grip.
[166:18.42]That's disgusting.
[166:19.93]What's wrong with that grip?
[166:21.29]I don't understand.
[166:25.33]You got sausage hands?
[166:27.01]No, I need a big... I got big hands.
[166:29.03]I need a big mouse.
[166:30.31]That's why I like the Death Adder.
[166:32.06]Well, I don't.
[166:32.64]I actually hate this thing.
[166:35.24]But I used to.
[166:36.48]The Death Adder is like a big, chunky mouse.
[166:41.40]I like big, chunky mice because my hands... I get these big palms.
[166:46.03]I palm a mouse.
[166:51.97]I have to do it like that.
[166:53.23]I got these big, thick hands.
[166:57.68]Coming up next, this is called the rumor.
[167:04.42]Commander, we have received a report that Jerma is trying to stream.
[167:09.25]Shall we deploy the rumor?
[167:11.43]The rumor is already on his way.
[167:14.81]Rumor.
[167:15.47]Status report.
[167:16.83]Are you ready to initiate operation and interrupt the stream?
[167:23.65]and you can start.
[167:25.31]What the fuck?
[167:51.07]267 miles per hour.
[167:52.77]Oh my god.

[168:32.86]Alright, that fucking guy driving the car.
[168:35.82]The guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour.
[168:42.10]It's just screamed in my ear.

[169:07.41]That's good shit.
[169:11.47]Um, by the way, driving a car at 300 miles per hour, I get scared.
[169:15.73]Going like 60, 65, like 65, 68, 70, wouldn't going... That would scare the shit out of me.
[169:28.96]I get scared at 75.
[169:31.17]Like, that's when it's like, slow, I don't want to go, this is too fast, it's scary.
[169:37.95]Like, some people drive 80, 90, 100, like, what the fuck?
[169:42.47]That's scream out loud speeds for me.
[169:50.50]Imagine twice that.

[171:42.10]Who would build a bridge like this?
[171:43.86]Maybe they just wanted to get rid of us.
[171:53.97]Why did it follow?
[171:57.64]Because I'm dumb.
[172:00.06]Well, at least you're not dead.
[172:03.70]Would you like to join me?
[172:04.88]Sure.
[172:05.20]How much does it cost to join you?

[177:38.94]The genius of the crowd.
[177:51.98]There is enough treachery, hatred, violence, and absurdity in the average human being to supply any given army, any given day.
[178:03.43]And the best at murder are those who preach against it.
[178:07.41]And the best at hate...

[180:30.83]uh this is Jerma985 virus on my pc here's your viewing screen the second time today it's the second time today I've had an absolute horrible hack on my pc to the fact that it's not even used the state where it's not even usable I'll show you what's on telly bear's got the swiper watching it's a bit of Star Trek I don't want you god awful ever to make this
[180:51.47]crap all over the country about these awful adverts, all these awful childish adverts about making this awful country.
[180:54.99]I don't want to show you that.
[180:57.41]I've had such a bad hack on my PC, I can't do anything here.
[180:59.37]Look, this is just, I can't even click on Microsoft Edge there, on the task manager.
[181:02.93]This is not working, nothing's working.
[181:04.09]This is the second time today that someone's hacked my PC so badly, I can do nothing on the PC.
[181:07.83]I don't want to be in it, because if somebody, I'd like this to date here, if somebody gets me to America now, United States of America, this second, I'll never come back to this god-awful country where people are allowed to attack my PC and behave in this awful way towards me.
[181:18.66]I can't stand being in this house where people can mess me around
[181:26.08]What in the name of God is going on?
[181:28.14]That was crazy.
[181:32.14]Why did I hack that?
[181:33.00]I didn't do that.
[181:34.68]Oh, spoilers!
[181:42.90]This one's called Penis Streamer.
[181:44.39]I can't wait to delete this one halfway through.
[182:13.31]What?
[182:13.81]What?
[182:15.19]What?
[182:16.67]What did it say?
[182:27.89]Penis music, I guess.
[182:30.71]I don't get it.
[182:31.41]I don't get it.
[182:31.93]I don't get it.
[182:33.31]I don't get it.
[182:33.99]I don't get it.
[182:45.94]I can't even.
[182:47.58]As the FEC fundraising deadline for 2019 approaches, I am once again asking for your financial support.
[182:57.05]Why would you do this?
[182:57.69]Because I think all of you know we don't have a Super PAC.
[183:01.62]I'm not running all over this country raising enormous sums of money from some of the wealthiest people in America.
[183:09.67]I am so proud of all of us that we have up to this point in the campaign received more individual contributions.
[183:18.54]It's the whole video.
[183:19.76]More Americans than any candidate in the history of American politics.
[183:25.63]That's the way we raise money.
[183:27.81]That's why we're going to win this election.
[183:30.07]Alright.
[183:31.56]You spent like $6,000 worth of PC computing power to make this video.
[183:37.79]Now, the truth is we have an excellent chance to win in Iowa, an excellent chance to win in New Hampshire.
[183:46.76]I can't watch the rest of this video.
[183:49.70]Don't tell him.
[183:50.36]Don't tell him.
[183:51.02]Don't tell him.
[183:51.74]Don't tell him.
[183:55.49]I already know.
[183:56.71]You know what I mean?
[183:58.19]Don't tell him.

[184:48.51]That's a real nice car.
[184:54.69]Quality vehicle.
[185:00.37]They last a long time.
[185:01.57]Some of the best mileage of any economy car.
[185:11.20]Why are these right next to each other?
[185:16.44]This is how you know Google algorithms are just... You should be scared.
[185:22.30]Like we should be terrified of the AI overtake.
[185:24.24]Look at this.
[185:33.63]Man of very few voices.
[185:35.17]Jerm of frog detective.
[185:38.65]This rant again.

[185:54.29]Jermonkey.
[186:20.09]You gotta chuckle out of me.
[186:22.73]I believe the next one is a follow-up.
[186:26.96]It is.
[186:28.16]Yeah, it has to be.
[186:33.42]Yeah.
[186:36.52]This is Living with Jerma Sucks.
[186:38.32]All I had to do was put my mouse on it to see a monkey on it.
[186:42.46]This is Living with Jerma Fucking Sucks.

[186:54.82]That's the only image you needed to see right there.
[187:00.34]Do it again.

[188:49.09]I will smite you.
[188:50.83]I will smite you with the fury of a thousand suns.
[188:59.27]Pretty accurate chat.
[189:04.39]That was an accurate depiction of the chat room sometimes.
[189:07.74]I look over and there sometimes are just letters here.
[189:15.70]This next one is called Meet the Jerma.
[189:20.64]Have we seen this before?
[189:21.56]I don't know.

[191:45.70]We're the rats.
[191:50.61]We pray at night.
[191:51.59]We suck at night.
[191:52.83]We're the rats.
[191:53.91]Tiny rat falls off the bridge.
[191:57.17]Who is in the audience laughing at this?
[192:02.19]They get this?
[192:03.01]There's like a full audience laughing.
[192:04.25]I wanna hear the audience.
[192:06.25]Dick, what?
[192:31.35]Holy shit.
[192:32.11]Alright.
[192:34.03]Wait a minute.
[192:34.45]Wait a minute.
[192:34.81]Wait a minute.
[192:35.39]This is a packed crowd of people.
[192:39.16]There's like 600 people in this audience.
[192:50.83]This is so many people.
[192:53.68]Alright, imagine being the person serving the school lunch and peeking in being, I want to see those kids laughing at it here.
[193:00.08]On your A game, we go now.
[193:01.60]Bloody hell.
[193:02.38]Boy, more importantly, since when did we have a rap problem?
[193:05.04]We don't.
[193:05.86]Get in.
[193:07.06]They drive off.
[193:07.80]Cut to interior cafe day.
[193:10.10]Inside the cafe, the chef commands his patrons.
[193:12.36]The man is dancing.
[193:13.56]Yeah, excuse me, sir.
[193:14.58]Yeah, over there dancing.
[193:16.52]It's actually $10 to dance in this building, so you're going to have to give me like a certain amount.
[193:20.12]The gang busts in.
[193:20.50]Chef goes flying.
[193:21.30]Oh, my God.
[193:21.76]We're going to die.
[193:22.54]Ladies.
[193:23.58]I have the attention of the class.
[193:26.12]My name is Dick Dastardly Richards, and I'm here to take that treasure chest that's in the back room.
[193:30.45]Go get it, boys.
[193:31.25]I'll follow you in.
[193:32.27]And let me tell you something, clerk.
[193:34.31]If you don't move a muscle, I'll make sure you stay there.
[193:38.19]Alright, let's go.
[193:38.83]Alright, hold on.
[193:40.53]They do the whole thing.
[193:43.40]...as the chef tries to put the cops off their scent.
[193:46.40]Hello, sir.
[193:47.00]Welcome to the rat cafe.
[193:48.28]There's no rats here.
[193:49.12]Just, uh...

[194:11.02]What are you talking about?
[194:12.72]You know, I could maybe... This is a college.
[194:16.67]Maybe I could come and give a speech.
[194:19.23]There's like 6,000 people in this audience.
[194:21.23]I could probably come and do his speech.
[194:25.07]What if I could... Can I do that?
[194:33.98]He's an egomaniac.
[194:36.44]What if I come and do... No, I can't go there.
[194:39.13]I can't go there.
[194:39.79]I'll...
[194:42.45]This is so surreal for me, and I'll tell you why.
[194:53.58]Knowing that this exists is like, I can't even believe this shit.
[194:58.44]Here's what I can't believe.
[194:59.72]I can't believe that people are doing this, and I can't believe there's an audience of people watching it.
[195:05.12]It's unbelievable to me.
[195:06.68]I can't even fucking believe it.
[195:13.89]Is the video unlisted?
[195:14.89]No, it's not.
[195:16.61]Egomaniac from Lost... Okay, let's get the audience reaction at the end of this here.
[195:20.17]Oh, shit!
[195:20.45]Oh!
[195:38.01]God.
[195:39.27]I can't even believe it.
[195:41.77]Didn't this happen before too?
[195:48.07]I can't even fathom something in Movie Maker.
[195:54.11]There are people watching this and laughing at it and doing it with musical notepads in front of them.
[196:04.78]It was adorable.
[196:07.34]Make a full production Broadway play.
[196:08.95]I actually was going to do a Jerma Rumble play.
[196:13.31]That fell through.
[196:16.25]Then we're going to try to get as many people in the audience as possible.
[196:22.60]We were just going to sell tickets for like a dollar and advertise it in whatever local town or city we were in and just see what happened.
[196:37.03]Hard to do some of these things.
[196:40.49]But that was fucking awesome.
[196:41.89]I don't know what to say.
[196:45.27]It's crazy to see people will do that.
[196:48.51]Because of the video I made.
[196:51.77]Feed his ego.
[196:54.12]No.
[196:54.64]But thank you.
[196:56.82]When are you going to do a live stage show?
[196:58.16]I don't know.
[196:58.72]Maybe.
[196:59.54]It'll be fun.
[197:03.79]Oh, I probably should have warned.
[197:05.53]This has got some flashing lights.
[197:11.97]I didn't realize that.
[197:13.93]Sorry about that.
[197:15.90]There's flashing lights in this one.
[197:24.74]Actually, this hurts my head.
[197:28.35]Okay, flashing lights.
[197:29.21]Here it comes.
[197:30.05]Yeah, I'm serious.
[197:35.69]Go.
[197:36.57]Warning.
[197:48.87]Ow.
[197:50.37]A little bit of blue and black together.
[197:51.81]Alright, now we've got some songs.
[197:58.90]Hey, it's me.
[198:01.28]Hey, it's me, your best friend.
[198:03.26]Oh, no, your best friend.
[198:05.25]I'm just a guy you don't don't what come on look at oh man it's like part of my hair turned into like California
[198:33.31]Cutting it off.
[198:34.37]It's coming off.
[198:35.63]Alright, let's get the songs on here.
[198:38.15]While we say goodnight.
[198:40.43]We'll call it here.
[198:41.43]We'll call it after the songs, obviously.
[198:44.24]Throw the Reddit shelf never again.
[198:49.00]We'll see you tomorrow if you take it off.
[198:50.56]We're going to do public domain movie night.
[198:55.77]As of tomorrow.
[198:59.93]We should be able to watch two, maybe even three public domain movies.
[199:07.19]I'm going to start with the gorilla.
[199:09.09]And we have to watch the whole thing.
[199:10.60]No, we cannot skip a second of it.
[199:17.02]Depends on how long they are.
[199:19.54]The gorilla is one hour long.
[199:24.84]It'll be fun.
[199:26.43]I plan on drinking at least one or two glasses of wine.
[199:28.93]It's going to be a wine night.
[199:34.21]Wine movie night.
[199:38.53]But let's get some songs on while we do the bits.
[199:41.11]I'm going to change up the music for the bits as you probably understand.
[199:45.09]Makes sense that way, doesn't it?
[199:47.13]Thanks for joining us for community content night number five, six.
[199:49.77]I'm going to get drunk, let's be real.
[199:52.82]No, no, no, maybe.
[199:57.90]We'll see you tomorrow.
[200:00.64]And let's check out some of these tracks.
[200:04.52]Thanks again.
[200:06.31]We'll see you soon.
[200:07.93]This one is called, uh, it's a Giant Enemy Spider Guardian.
[200:11.51]Full song.
[200:14.49]Let's take a listen.
[200:16.46]The Giant Enemy Spider.
[200:22.72]Two Glass George.
[200:24.04]What?
[200:25.48]This is actually pretty good.
[200:30.49]This is pretty good.
[200:42.15]This is a battle.
[200:45.93]There's a link to this one.
[200:48.62]I mean, it is a giant enemy spider.
[200:59.00]That's right.
[200:59.70]Hey, thank you, Kootate, for the five dollars earlier this evening.
[201:04.95]Thanks, Kootate.
[201:08.73]They say, hey Jerma, I just want to say thank you for helping me get over a breakup.
[201:12.63]Keep doing what you do.
[201:15.91]Thanks for the five dollars and hopefully, hopefully you do better.
[201:20.61]Good.
[201:22.55]Not better.
[201:23.77]Well, hopefully you do better.
[201:24.49]I hope all of you do better.
[201:31.17]Yeah, well, hold on.
[201:39.56]I realize that putting both headphones in is probably a bad idea.
[201:43.45]Everyone's saying, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[201:47.25]Expect the music.
[201:49.55]This is why I can't wear two headphones.
[202:01.32]The music's frickin', the music's frickin' fantastic, mate.
[202:10.29]Coming up next, we have a giant enemy tree.
[202:16.69]This is an original song, by the way.
[202:21.84]I made this one up.
[202:22.74]Give you a link.
[202:47.09]I didn't make this like I did the original Chilean.
[202:49.63]This is good.
[203:05.80]This is fucking really good.
[203:09.00]This is fantastic.
[203:12.20]This is seriously buff-
[204:34.78]I fucking hate streaming.
[204:36.50]It's like the stupidest.
[204:37.40]I fucking am so done with it.
[204:38.88]It's like not even... Seriously, I'm just not going to do it anymore.
[204:42.89]I'm just done, I think.
[204:47.95]Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
[204:51.75]985 here.
[204:53.25]Saw that I was muted for a little while.
[204:55.20]Sorry about that.
[204:55.96]I'm not sure what happened.
[204:56.76]Something got screwed up.
[204:58.46]But I'm back and I'm ready.
[205:00.62]By the way, that was from me going...
[205:05.48]Nice job.
[205:10.37]Good shit.
[205:14.89]Sad, bad, bad joke.
[205:17.75]I guess you hate us.
[205:20.33]No, of course not.
[205:21.22]Why would I hate anybody?
[205:25.82]That was good.
[205:29.84]Coming up next, we have StreamerDumb.
[205:33.36]Is this one?
[205:36.01]Oh my god, that's you.
[205:41.51]Those eyes just make me jump.
[205:51.31]Is that a piss in my face?
[206:26.21]so much more.
[206:56.30]This is fucking good.
[206:58.96]Link, link up.
[206:59.90]Okay, I got you.
[207:00.82]That was good shit.
[207:07.53]That's called streamer dumb.
[207:11.41]But Kutade, we're going to do a few in between songs here.
[207:14.25]Respect the music, right?
[207:16.83]Sorry to hear about your breakup.
[207:21.67]Thanks for the $5.
[207:22.79]I wish you the best.
[207:25.80]It's never easy.
[207:26.58]Give it a little bit of time.
[207:33.26]Sam, freelance police, thanks for $2.50.
[207:34.68]Hey, Jeremy, remember two months ago when I said I was torn between game design and music and university?
[207:41.42]I do.
[207:43.46]Well, in the meantime, I applied for a semester abroad at a music university in Australia, and I got accepted with a super pug.
[207:50.39]Today I woke up to an email from them saying that international students had their applications withdrawn because of the coronavirus.
[207:56.23]Thanks for being there and cheering us up with your streams during these fucked up times.
[208:05.44]Yeah, I've heard... I have no idea what's going to happen with school and stuff.
[208:13.00]Because a lot of places are still canceling school through the end of the year.
[208:15.96]What happens to the students?
[208:18.66]Is everybody just kind of held back a year?
[208:21.88]Do you do it again?
[208:22.70]What do you do with the group of students?
[208:25.22]Do it online?
[208:27.67]Just do online classes.
[208:29.73]Yeah, I guess.
[208:37.25]All school is on Zoom now.
[208:47.14]That's rough.
[208:51.14]You can't do online classes on everything.
[208:52.92]Yeah, yeah, you... I would imagine a lot of stuff that requires hands-on experience and lab work and... It's gonna be a really, really strange time.
[209:08.21]But hopefully when this is all over with and done and we can go back to normal, hopefully, or at least however we can get there, hopefully...

[209:48.60]Better not hear any complaints from chat.
[209:50.02]I'm treating.
[209:51.34]You can have a slice too, streamer.
[209:53.94]But I bet you like pineapples on yours.
[209:55.74]Ugh.
[209:56.14]Anyway, thanks for all you do.
[209:57.18]I don't.
[209:58.80]I think pineapple is... I love pineapple as a fruit.
[210:01.42]I don't like it on pizza.
[210:06.28]I'm sorry.
[210:07.50]It's fine.
[210:07.98]Y'all know that opinion by now.
[210:11.88]Thanks a lot.
[210:13.76]Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[210:14.82]There's a link.
[210:16.32]Deleted band.
[210:17.20]Really cool to see you bringing back last year's style.
[210:19.58]Not sure what it was.
[210:24.13]Speaking of styles, how about a Giant Enemy Spider epic version?
[210:28.21]The Giant Enemy Spider.
[210:29.79]The Giant Enemy Spider.
[210:43.76]It's like a boss fight in a Castlevania game.
[210:53.41]It's a good game too.
[210:54.13]Coming up next is Giant Enemy Ster.
[211:06.70]It was catchy.
[211:08.98]It was a good one.
[211:10.72]Thanks for those.
[211:37.26]Enemy spiders.
[211:39.44]Don't get the VOD muted.
[211:40.51]I don't think that, that shouldn't mute a VOD.
[211:44.77]Hey, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50.
[211:46.61]I don't have much money, but how much for the clips links to be back?
[211:50.95]They'll be back next week.
[211:53.87]You broke it.
[211:54.67]You guys broke it.
[211:59.72]Links will be back next week.
[212:02.18]With a slight change.
[212:03.42]Uh-oh, what's that mean?
[212:06.73]to the 250 though whole of one zombie thanks for 250 I've been having back issues so I finally decided to augment myself in order to boomer brace hopefully now I'll soon have the posture of a closed door and double as a shelf boomers rise up if you still can that's posture goals right there a door
[212:39.98]Thanks for the $2.50.
[212:41.09]Good luck.
[212:41.59]Hopefully you feel better soon.
[212:44.65]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the $2.50.
[212:46.37]Remember, Jeremy, you silly dog, you're still gonna watch Garf's Sonic Rebuilt video.
[212:50.29]It got canned last Community Content Night in favor of Joel's movie.
[212:54.16]That's true.
[212:55.28]You promised you'd watch it this time.
[212:57.14]Well, that's probably super late for you.
[212:59.32]The movie's like an hour long.
[213:01.50]Y'all know how much Garf likes his naps in the cat box.
[213:04.48]If it's gotta wait till next time, it's still gotta wait.
[213:07.45]Can't take out a lasagna out of the oven before it's cooked.
[213:10.66]But if you do watch, make sure to see the credits in the climax.
[213:13.98]Yeah, I did say I was going to skip through it.
[213:17.26]Watch it tomorrow.
[213:18.96]I'll watch it tomorrow.
[213:20.30]I'll watch it tomorrow.
[213:21.70]I'll watch it.
[213:22.52]I know.
[213:22.92]But here's the thing, right?
[213:24.70]When.
[213:24.94]Alright.
[213:27.04]The community content night maximum video watching is supposed to be five minutes.
[213:33.41]And you tell me this thing's an hour long.
[213:36.11]That is a long time.
[213:40.49]That would be live action, yeah, live action Garfield night.
[213:47.35]Why did you agree to it?
[213:48.78]I don't know.
[213:50.38]See, I just did.
[213:50.98]I said I was going to skim through it, and I still will.
[214:01.03]No viewer gets an hour dedicated to them.
[214:05.38]Well, that... Because then if you don't... If I don't put, like, a cap on it, then... You watch this one-hour video.
[214:11.90]Why won't you watch mine?
[214:13.11]Watch my video.
[214:15.15]Well, I don't want to watch your video.
[214:16.69]Well, why the fuck not?
[214:17.43]You watched Garfield's hour-long video.
[214:19.93]Yeah, I... Oh, I did?
[214:22.13]Okay.
[214:22.81]What's yours?
[214:25.75]Gotta put some kind of cap on it.
[214:30.97]But I will... I promise I will watch at least a handful of the clips.
[214:42.44]One hour long ayaya is mine.
[214:47.99]I will watch it, Garfield.
[214:49.05]I promise.
[214:51.53]Not the whole thing.
[214:52.39]Some of it.
[214:53.07]Pieces of it.
[214:54.13]Lips.
[214:56.49]Hey, Milkistan, thanks for the $10.50 Hyper Light Drifter OST.
[215:00.44]Please, thank you.
[215:01.60]Remember this for next time.
[215:03.40]Next community content night.
[215:04.44]I want that in the chat room, please.
[215:11.00]Remember that one.
[215:13.38]This next one is called Tea Break.
[215:19.08]Tea Break.
[215:19.66]This will probably match up pretty well with what this screen is showing right now.
[215:24.20]So let's just keep it there.
[215:24.96]Keep going.
[215:29.88]This is like perfect background music for what I'm doing right now.
[215:38.42]Thanks for the $10 though, Ilkistan.
[215:44.03]Hole of one zombie thanks to the 250.
[215:48.13]Oh yeah, you should watch Bugleberry Christmas stream at times two speed.
[215:52.79]Talk so slowly the sudden quick outbursts are funny.
[215:55.25]I don't think I want to do that.
[216:12.46]Hey, Potion Dweller, thanks for the $5.
[216:14.18]I'm glad you are moved, friend.
[216:15.78]This message is, however, for Chat.
[216:18.68]Okay.
[216:21.81]Hope you don't mind me using you as a bulletin board for a request.
[216:25.53]Chat, if you have AC and can help me buy turnips tomorrow, please do.
[216:29.65]My turnip stonks are poop and likely going to be $40 per tomorrow.
[216:34.65]I bought a lot of them and need to sell them.
[216:36.90]If you can help me, please DM me on Twitch.
[216:38.62]Anything above $91 will help me break even.
[216:42.74]There you go.
[216:43.70]That was Potion Dweller.
[216:46.48]Potion Dweller, enjoy the 5,000 DMs, half of which will be fake.
[216:51.76]Good luck finding the real friend code.
[216:58.21]Hopefully somebody helps you.
[217:05.55]Hey, thanks to Garfield Propaganda.
[217:07.61]That's an interesting name.
[217:10.36]I was showing my friend some of your stream highlights when her mom walked in wondering what we were watching.
[217:15.00]After watching you for about five minutes, her mom asked us if you were clinically insane.
[217:20.00]I just said, probably.
[217:20.88]Anyways, Jeremy, keep up the great work.
[217:23.18]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[217:30.60]Appreciate it.
[217:35.38]And mom, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
[217:41.31]Moms do be sayin' that shit.
[217:46.21]I wanna let you know that the rat in a jar pic that chat told you to skip was a reference... to a... Oh.
[217:58.74]I'm gonna have to start screenin' these.
[218:05.94]We've done five or six of these?
[218:09.07]It's time to start screening them.
[218:11.65]I'm gonna have to have an academy that screens them.
[218:19.24]Didn't want it to get there, but we've gotten there.
[218:23.90]I'm gonna have to include an academy now.
[218:31.86]God damn it.
[218:34.46]Potion dweller, thanks for the $2.50.
[218:35.82]It is time for your daily hamster pellet feeding.
[218:37.98]Eat up, my little pet.
[218:39.54]Is that a weird... That's a weird thing, too.
[218:41.20]Is that a weird... Party power, thanks for $3.
[218:47.61]What a fucking legend streamer.
[218:49.17]He's just such a... He's just such great company.
[218:51.63]A genuine thank you.
[218:52.57]Well, thank you.
[218:53.83]Party power, $7.
[218:57.80]Thanks a lot.
[218:59.46]This is really... This is good.
[219:00.40]This is a nice... This is a chill song.
[219:02.58]I like this one.
[219:12.24]This is great.
[219:14.30]Nice work.
[219:17.50]Coming up next is, this one's called Father.
[219:19.74]50th anniversary.
[219:24.57]My father was fairly well.
[219:26.03]Right.
[219:27.49]He would sometimes come home and showers, various toys, trinkets, and the like.
[219:35.39]But my father also brought something else into the house.
[219:45.78]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[219:47.58]All of you.
[219:48.16]This works, too.
[220:23.23]Word soup is what it is.
[220:24.61]Let's get the shit out of me.
[220:52.77]You missed the student bits.
[220:54.01]Thanks for playing the Rat Movie Live, your huge inspiration to a small group of us at NEU.
[221:01.08]And if you're wondering, the... If you're wondering, the... It's too much spam.
[221:06.62]I can't read it.
[221:08.41]If you're wondering, the performance was shown at an open mic type venue with 100 people.
[221:13.11]But the video was cut short.
[221:15.43]We were finishing up a little after that.
[221:17.21]David and Jacob.
[221:17.99]Thanks a lot.
[221:18.85]Thanks a lot.
[221:19.39]Seriously.
[221:19.97]100 people.
[221:20.26]I told you there was a huge crowd.
[221:31.75]Thanks a lot, you two.
[221:33.83]I'm shocked and honored that somebody would think that was worth doing in front of people.
[221:38.53]And admitting that you've seen that video, by the way.
[221:40.47]That's like another one that I'm happy.
[221:42.15]Thanks for that, too.
[221:42.79]I can't even.
[221:59.22]Moving on.
[221:59.48]Some of you guys have created such funny shit here.
[222:28.07]Yeah, sure.
[222:28.73]Have I made up a ton of random things for this stream?
[222:31.30]Yeah.
[222:32.82]How many random things have you guys just done that we all react to?
[222:36.46]It happens all the time.
[222:37.12]That was Generate Blue.
[222:42.40]Thanks for the $3.
[222:45.94]Keta Meme.
[222:46.56]Thanks for the $2.50.
[222:47.32]Thanks for the lockdown entertainment.
[222:48.62]It's much better than watching heroin addicts fighting the street.
[222:51.56]Hope you're staying safe.
[222:52.35]Holy shit.
[222:57.16]Like, once a year.
[222:58.10]We talk and we are out on the town.
[223:00.22]We don't talk every day because I have class.
[223:02.42]I have class.
[223:04.32]Who's talking right now?
[223:12.00]Link, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[223:25.79]Hey, Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[223:27.11]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[223:28.92]Grow a mullet.
[223:29.70]They're both short and long.
[223:31.54]Yes, they are.
[223:33.52]Thanks for the $15.
[223:38.44]Hey, Radshley.
[223:39.34]Thanks for the $250.
[223:40.18]Shave head.
[223:40.98]No.
[223:42.84]My face is too rocky for a shaved head.
[223:44.54]We've talked about that.
[223:45.68]Hey, Kin the Swin.
[223:50.55]Thanks for the $5. $5.
[223:54.81]Hey Jim, I love your content.
[223:55.79]I know you're still looking for some public domain movies.
[223:58.83]From my major in history, I've had to watch a lot of old Soviet movies, which are all public domain.
[224:02.94]Battleship Potemkin, Alexander Nevsky, Man with a Movie Camera.
[224:08.28]There's a lot of really good ones from around 1920 to 1930.
[224:10.68]Might be worth checking out.
[224:13.30]Some are pretty crazy and silly.
[224:19.91]Hey, if this goes over well tomorrow...
[224:23.99]I'm going to turn this down for just a second.
[224:25.37]If this goes over well tomorrow, and this is fun, and this isn't just like, well, that sucked.
[224:30.67]Let's never do that again.
[224:32.41]Of course, I want to do it again.
[224:36.58]So, we'll see how it goes tomorrow.
[224:45.72]We also had three dolls from Robofusion.
[224:50.20]I genuinely watch every stream I can in hopes that Bugleberry shows up.
[224:55.58]You're gonna be so happy at some point in the future.
[224:58.54]I can guarantee it.
[225:01.06]GraduallyGrace, thanks for $5.
[225:02.60]You cannot understand the pure fucking hilarity you caused for me by showing my Mega Milk image.
[225:11.81]I wish... Mega... Can I ever get away from this?
[225:19.65]I'm never gonna be able to get away from it.
[225:25.18]I will never be able to avoid that ever again, will I?
[225:27.88]God damn it.
[225:34.71]Well.
[225:37.89]Also, they say, my Mega Milk image, I wish I was sorry, but I'm just not.
[225:46.15]I'm howling, man.
[225:47.41]Absolutely howling.
[225:49.59]So to make up for it, I have the first ever bits I've ever donated in much love from Scotland.
[225:55.00]From a relatively new viewer who wishes they had known you earlier.
[225:58.12]Well, welcome.
[225:59.52]GraduallyGrace.
[226:00.14]Thanks for the five dollars and thanks for the image.
[226:04.14]I'm howling, man.
[226:06.72]Did I catch these five subs from Eased Waffles?
[226:08.60]I don't think I said thanks.
[226:11.34]Five subs from Eased Waffles.
[226:13.25]And then five subs from Jingo Jango Wizard Spy.
[226:18.83]Thanks, both of you.
[226:22.08]Next up on our song list is called... A Giant Enemy Spider Piano Edition.
[226:28.97]Somebody doing it on a piano.
[226:30.95]Take a listen.
[226:33.77]The Giant Enemy Spider.
[226:36.39]Here we go.
[226:51.85]Dentist.
[226:54.73]Hey, Stripes Beast, thanks for the 250.
[226:57.31]That's saloon music?
[227:06.49]Kind of is.
[227:08.45]Thanks, Stripes Beast.
[227:09.49]Hey, Jerma, you think before you die, we should build a terracotta soldier tomb for you so your subscribers can follow you into the afterlife.
[227:17.32]Instead of weapons, we can bring you gamer gear.
[227:20.40]That's freaking me out, man.
[227:23.98]That's funny to a point where if I... I don't know.
[227:27.07]No, that's too weird.
[227:29.03]No.
[227:30.99]No, I want to get cremated.
[227:32.23]I want my ashes to be fucking spread.
[227:34.03]I want my ashes to be spread at a... I don't know.
[227:39.61]And into like a clown shoe.
[227:46.47]Not a gamer tomb, no.
[227:51.99]Don't say that to me.
[227:57.43]Have somebody snort your ashes.
[228:00.62]What, so they can get my power?
[228:04.02]No, no, no, no.
[228:09.99]Omega monkaS. Probably not, though.
[228:14.77]Hey, Rail.
[228:16.75]Rail Puner.
[228:18.43]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[228:19.73]Jermas smell like poopy.
[228:22.46]That's a $10 message to say Jerma smells like poopy.
[228:26.31]That was $10.
[228:26.57]1,000 bits.
[228:27.23]Alright, next we have Biawalk.
[228:52.15]Expensive poopy.
[228:59.44]All these seem to work really well at the end, don't they?
[229:07.74]A thank you to Mars.
[229:11.19]for the $3?
[229:11.61]Jerem, I just wanted to let you know that you made a joke during last night's stream, similar to a joke you made in City Skylines.
[229:18.13]You joked about raising the price of crack to its max for just one day, which is similar to when you said you'd fix every problem in your city by raising all taxes to 100% for a day.
[229:27.16]I just thought you should know this.
[229:29.08]Also, I am high.
[229:35.59]Is that a joke or is that a business strategy?
[229:41.04]Thank you, Mars, for the three dollars.
[229:44.10]Let's link this one here to make sure people can see it.
[229:47.56]It's called Beewa.
[229:48.92]Hey, Erdevious, thanks for the $2.60.
[230:07.36]Jeremiah, I go to Northeastern.
[230:10.63]The school that the rats played.
[230:13.71]The school that did the rats play.
[230:15.49]I can guarantee if you showed up to do a talk, there would be at least like a hundred people who would show up.
[230:20.80]You're really popular here.
[230:23.39]Please come give a TED Talk on Centennial Quad.
[230:32.00]At least a hundred people would go?
[230:41.44]cult leader cult leader god damn it Jerma is actually a celebrity in one place Jerma in 3d yeah
[231:07.22]I'd have to want to do something.
[231:09.00]I wouldn't be able just to come talk about anything.
[231:10.75]I would need a plan.
[231:18.33]That's stupid enough for me to want to do, though.
[231:21.01]Maybe in the future.
[231:21.69]Who knows?
[231:22.09]If they would even let me.
[231:23.89]What about the musical?
[231:30.23]I... I don't think so.
[231:37.40]Go look at me for an hour.
[231:43.94]No.
[231:48.80]It would never let me back in.
[231:54.84]I'm not doing it.
[231:56.96]Thank you, TileGoManiac for three bucks.
[232:02.69]On the topic of schooling, yes.
[232:04.93]Most
[232:06.82]Um, somebody's beating something.
[232:07.80]There's a speedrun in three seconds.
[232:09.38]What the fuck?
[232:13.28]Uh, thank you, Tyler.
[232:14.88]They say, on the topic of schooling, yes, most everything has been moved online.
[232:17.46]It's really interesting how things are being handled.
[232:20.02]But it's hard to stay motivated in the same place where I normally would relax and work on personal projects.
[232:25.55]Motivation is bitch, but we're just all trying our best.
[232:29.63]Thanks to the entertainment, well, this whack-ass shit plays out.
[232:35.22]yeah no that makes it makes total sense separating your work and your play is actually a really good idea and if you can't then you sort of kind of mix them together and it's a it doesn't work out so well for a lot of people I'm one of them I know we make you use that term office but if if I didn't have my computer and my monitors and my desk in a different room
[233:04.39]I'm not... I think it would be kind of fucked up.
[233:07.41]Like, it has to be like this.
[233:08.45]I have to have it in here.
[233:10.31]It has to be, like, in a separate area.
[233:13.67]So I can imagine.
[233:14.71]Especially something like schoolwork, where you need that environment.
[233:24.60]But yeah, hopefully it is over soon.
[233:28.72]Everybody wants this in the rearview mirror.
[233:31.30]So people can try to go back to normal.
[233:34.82]It's just a question of when, how, and logistically, how does that work?
[233:39.46]Hopefully over the coming months, we can figure that out.
[233:44.31]Thanks for the three bucks.
[233:49.60]Thank you, Emoli.
[233:51.64]Okay, thanks for the 250.
[233:53.00]Jerma, I'm Emily.
[233:54.35]Emily, okay, there we go.
[233:56.03]And it's my birthday today, so I brought, I bought you bits as a treat for your birthday.
[234:01.55]Thank you for an awesome stream.
[234:03.45]You bought me on your birthday.
[234:07.55]You should be getting, you should be celebrating your birthday and getting bits on your birthday.
[234:13.08]Hopefully somebody gave you bits for your birthday.
[234:15.62]Did you have a birthday party and have, did somebody send you bits?
[234:26.52]Send them back.
[234:27.76]Send the bits back.
[234:29.83]I don't have the capability to do that.
[234:33.43]What does it say?
[234:34.71]All refunds are final or whatever it was.
[234:38.63]What's the thing I got it right?
[234:40.33]All sales are final.
[234:46.10]Happy birthday, though, Emily.
[234:49.04]Thanks and take care.
[234:51.58]Hope you had a good one.
[234:53.65]A freak out.
[234:54.39]Thanks for the $5.
[234:54.83]Jeremy, have you watched The Sopranos?
[234:56.92]If not, here's the whole series, but only when they say gabagool.
[235:01.62]I'm going to watch that eventually.
[235:04.54]I'm going to watch that eventually.
[235:06.08]I've seen like four episodes of it.
[235:07.38]I'm going to watch it eventually, so I don't want to be spoiled.
[235:10.33]Thanks for the $5.
[235:11.21]I'm not going to watch it.
[235:17.19]Thanks for the $5, freak out.
[235:19.99]Give us the link.
[235:21.67]No, I don't want you to be spoiled either.
[235:26.25]Alright, here.
[235:26.61]I don't know.
[235:27.81]Let me just make sure this is what this is.
[235:30.26]There's not something else.
[235:38.80]Okay.
[235:42.17]I guess that is what it is.
[235:43.01]This is the video.
[235:47.57]Spoilers for the Sopranos, maybe.
[235:49.15]I don't know.
[235:50.79]Thanks for the $5.00.
[235:53.83]Cyrix, thanks for $3.
[235:54.89]Honest opinion on the Mario Galaxy OST.
[235:58.20]I actually love it.
[235:59.24]I love the pivot that Nintendo did with the orchestral mixes they've done for the Mario games since Mario Galaxy.
[236:07.40]Good choice.
[236:07.96]16 seconds of spoilers.
[236:13.63]Probably that's what I'm saying.
[236:14.57]Just be careful.
[236:15.09]Hey, Appleshift, thanks for the $2.50. $2.50.
[236:19.76]Apple Shift.
[236:21.14]School stuff really is wild right now, yeah?
[236:23.60]The rest of my senior year is being done online.
[236:26.21]And my high school graduation was canceled.
[236:28.73]Not to mention, prom and senior breakfast were also canned.
[236:32.77]And I might have to take my first semester of art college online.
[236:36.09]Shit really be sucking.
[236:37.19]Class of 2020 got it rough.
[236:42.13]Yeah, that's... That fucking sucks.
[236:45.71]It really does.
[236:54.46]It's just a total detonation of everybody's lives.
[237:05.23]Do a Roblox prom?
[237:09.02]I mean, people used to get married in World of Warcraft, didn't they?
[237:12.36]Nothing wrong with that.
[237:17.70]Yeah, just do it in, like, Warcraft.
[237:21.59]They still do, yeah.
[237:22.89]It's fine.
[237:28.44]We got a couple more songs to put on here.
[237:30.10]We have, I think, two or three?
[237:31.30]I think this is called Try Another.
[237:34.80]Horn music.
[237:36.98]This is fucking good, though.
[238:02.49]That's pretty good.
[238:03.09]I can't link this one because it was not put anywhere besides in the Discord.
[238:07.74]I do want to stress one more time very, very loudly.
[238:12.86]Please put your images, your links, if you can get them on a website.
[238:19.60]This is my on my computer, I had to download it.
[238:23.40]Get it on a site like a YouTube or a like even like a SoundCloud.
[238:29.66]Or directly in the Discord can work, but it's easier for me if it's on an actual website.
[238:37.85]Turn down your mic.
[238:39.89]No.
[238:42.25]That was good, though.
[238:44.43]This one's called Jerma Nightmare Music.
[238:46.80]I've had nightmares.
[238:48.64]Like, we've fucked up dreams where this song would play in the background.
[238:52.50]Yeah, this is bad.
[238:53.38]Slower.
[238:55.36]And the tempo was decreased.
[239:00.04]Holy shit, this is fucking messed up.
[239:06.25]Oh, you asshole!
[239:08.37]Holy shit, it's exactly the way it is in my nightmare!
[239:40.17]Oh my god, it's harmful.
[239:49.14]I can't listen to this anymore.
[239:50.64]This is exactly what it's like in the nightmare.
[239:59.84]Oh, thank you for that one.
[240:01.36]I don't know who you were, but why?
[240:03.56]I didn't know that there was a boss battle in this.
[240:07.88]Giant enemy spider!
[240:08.96]The giant enemy spider.
[240:11.25]Never playing that one again.
[240:30.93]Thanks for the, uh, clip.
[240:32.15]Appreciate it.
[240:34.91]Moo means moo.
[240:35.49]Thanks for $5 in the spirit of community content night.
[240:38.35]Here's my doo-doo rats remix that I made ages ago before these were a thing.
[240:44.34]Doo-doo.
[240:45.58]Doo-doo.
[240:53.16]Feeling it so far?
[240:53.82]Feeling it?
[240:57.58]Rip VOD?
[240:58.62]This is a VOD ripper?
[241:00.93]Also, rip Vaude.
[241:03.87]Didn't put that in the message.
[241:10.50]Vaude's probably already dead.
[241:18.13]Chef's Corner, thanks for the $5.
[241:19.61]Literally dye your hair green.
[241:21.13]No, I'll never dye my hair any color.

[243:07.04]Anyways, much love and a big hug from Texas.
[243:12.36]Thanks a lot for the $3, Siren, first of all, and happy to be some company for you.

[244:06.14]Stanktron, thanks for 250.
[244:07.44]Hey, since you're coming to schools now, would you come to mine?
[244:11.02]Also, I have a few friends at different schools.
[244:12.86]So if you could come to their schools, that would be so cool.
[244:15.36]I'm not going to do like a college tour.
[244:21.09]No, I ain't even doing this once.
[244:25.83]Come to mind.
[244:26.75]Go do a world school tour.
[244:28.81]How's that?
[244:36.92]And then finally we have X Whimsical Moose.
[244:39.48]Thanks for 250.
[244:41.50]Thank you, Jerma.
[244:41.92]I've been watching for three years now and I've loved every bit of it.
[244:43.94]You've gotten me in the chat through tough times, Jerma.
[244:46.76]Thanks for continuing to watch.
[244:54.82]Thanks for being here.
[244:58.08]And that's the end.
[244:58.74]Thanks for joining us again for another Community Content Night.
[245:02.72]We're going to do the other one sooner than later.
[245:04.08]Because I do want to catch up again all the way through April.
[245:08.10]Or at least all the way through March into April.
[245:15.72]Appreciate it, everybody.
[245:19.08]We had a couple more bits come in right now.
[245:20.74]Appreciate the streams, Jerma.
[245:21.72]This is from Evil Fish. $5.00.
[245:25.69]Thanks a lot, Evil Fish.
[245:27.65]I'm a math and science teacher and have been figuring out how to teach math and science from a distance.
[245:32.39]It's been proper hectic, but have thankfully been able to take a relaxing time the past few days.
[245:39.23]I'm feeling recharged enough to take on the next term.
[245:41.40]I want to thank you and chat for helping me reset.
[245:46.06]All the best, guys.
[245:47.30]Good luck.
[245:48.70]You are in uncharted waters as a teacher.
[245:52.64]You have to redo and rethink literally everything you know about how to teach.
[245:58.98]Oh, by the way, you have three days to figure that out.
[246:02.92]You have like two weeks to figure that out.
[246:05.46]So thanks for doing what you do.
[246:08.42]Keep educating our students.
[246:11.78]You're doing a great thing.
[246:12.70]Thank you.
[246:15.76]There's a link for that one.
[246:16.92]I can give you a link for that one.
[246:24.27]Thank you, Evil Fish.
[246:25.07]Thank you, LagX for the $3.
[246:27.21]I lost my job.
[246:28.05]Found some of your streams online.
[246:29.93]This is the first stream I've been able to go to.
[246:32.67]Thanks for being you.
[246:34.74]Sorry to hear about your job.
[246:37.92]But first stream here, welcome.
[246:44.34]Hopefully this all resets soon and we can get as many people as we can back to normal.
[246:52.31]Thanks for the $3.
[246:53.47]I wish you the best.
[246:59.09]And I will see you tomorrow for Public Domain Movie Night.

[247:14.13]Pacific.
[247:14.61]I'm going to watch The Gorilla.
[247:18.56]And I'm going to have some wine, because I find that's probably an opportune time to have a few glasses of wine.
[247:24.54]Because when you watch a movie from 1939...
[247:30.34]Few more bitches came in right at the end.
[247:31.56]Crypto, thanks for the $4.
[247:33.16]No message, just $4 from Crypto.

[247:43.64]Thank you.
[247:47.03]I just finished my last final right before I joined.
[247:53.24]I aced it, by the way.
[247:54.88]That's good to hear.
[247:56.26]Glad to have it finished, but worried about the future.
[247:58.10]Not going to have anything to do for a long time.
[248:01.46]I'm glad I can spend it with you and chat.
[248:03.64]Very happy to have you.
[248:06.68]Good to hear that you aced that test, by the way.
[248:11.00]Hope we go back to normal soon.
[248:13.16]Everybody wants to.
[248:17.96]Thanks for the five dollars.
[248:20.91]And then finally, Stanktron again, 250.

[249:09.59]It's mostly rock and roll.
[249:14.33]See you at the public domain movie night.
[249:18.17]Words are hard to say.
[249:18.93]See you tomorrow.
