[01:05.09]Hello again.
[01:05.85]Hi.
[01:09.47]Power's on.
[01:10.97]I have electricity.
[01:11.69]We can actually sit in it if not in the dark now.
[01:14.35]Which is good.
[01:18.86]This is like knock on wood because I'm certain that there's going to be issues tonight.
[01:24.94]Now, if I'm so certain...
[01:27.30]The more that I talk about how certain I am, the less likely it's going to happen, and the more that I can prepare you and myself to be ready for it, right?
[01:34.12]So, like, shit's going to go down, technical problems, the internet's going to stop working, I'm going to lose power again.
[01:39.15]Let's just all blanket statement that whole thing, because now it might not happen.
[01:43.85]You know what I'm saying?
[01:47.27]Anyways, hi.
[01:50.19]Sorry I didn't stream on Friday.
[01:53.89]You know, I'll tell you a little quick story.
[01:55.39]Well, you know, wait for people to get in here first.
[01:59.67]I'll see you in like fucking two minutes.
[02:04.69]Oh, by the way, crack the seal on that fresh Gatorade.
[02:11.83]It's expired in October of 2008.
[02:52.39]Okay.
[02:53.37]So, let me make sure there's nothing in the tray here.
[02:56.69]There isn't.
[02:58.99]So, I need to do like a previously on.
[03:02.39]Previously on Jerma985.
[03:05.47]I burnt a CD in my computer blue screen.
[03:08.47]And then I lost power for three days.
[03:11.03]That's what happened.
[03:13.29]The last thing you heard me say was, I wonder what... And then the stream turned off.
[03:17.90]So, let's recap.
[03:20.22]We've been playing Monster Rancher.
[03:22.69]The original one.
[03:25.11]I really like this game.
[03:27.07]This game is a lot of fun.
[03:28.47]I'm having a blast with it.
[03:29.33]That's why we're playing it again.
[03:31.69]Expect to see the other Monster Ranchers on this stream.
[03:36.40]Because there's like six of them.
[03:38.02]There's Monster Rancher 2.
[03:38.80]There's Monster Rancher 3.
[03:39.84]There's Monster Rancher X.
[03:45.11]x-rated no I don't know if that's what it is but you know so hopefully we don't blue screen I don't know what the happened to my computer but I'm terrified now because I haven't been able to turn it on since that happened you understand so I brick my computer by burning a cd and then turn off the computer alright we'll try again tomorrow nope no power
[04:10.95]This is the first time I've had my computer turned off for more than fucking an hour.
[04:14.87]Is right now.
[04:16.37]In three days.
[04:18.35]So, just be aware of that.
[04:20.79]Hi, guys.
[04:21.55]Welcome to Monster Rancher 1.
[04:24.64]The last thing we were going to do... We were going to put in the WWF music album.
[04:34.80]Volume 3.
[04:35.26]Right?
[04:37.92]Let's see.
[04:38.20]Where is it?
[04:41.28]Actually, no, sorry, this is Volume 4.
[04:42.56]Hold on a second, wait, this is important.
[04:50.25]Look at this.
[04:50.67]Alright, alright, look at this.
[04:54.75]So we got WWF The Music Volume 3, right?
[04:59.25]See how, where is it?
[05:00.37]Look in the corner, Volume 3.
[05:01.49]Can you see that?
[05:06.25]And inside is Volume 4.
[05:11.26]How many of these did I own?
[05:13.30]Did I own every single fucking one?
[05:18.30]Apparently.
[05:20.24]But that's going in there now.
[05:21.99]Volume 4 in the Volume 3 case.
[05:25.77]I'll be checking in with you guys every few often, you know what I mean?
[05:28.87]Alright, let's go to the shrine.
[05:31.07]God, I'm so scared.
[05:33.05]This has nothing to do with my computer.
[05:34.82]I'm afraid to open this because I'm going to blue screen my computer.
[05:39.16]Now we need to go to the shrine.
[05:42.39]Oh, wait, you guys need to hear the fucking Tiny Toons music.
[05:46.01]There we go.
[05:47.31]Somebody told me they were going to drive themselves crazy.
[05:49.37]Oh, the hair?
[05:54.47]What do you mean?
[05:56.71]Bring back the forehead.
[06:00.48]Fuck you.
[06:02.30]Fuck you.
[06:03.10]Alright, WWF The Music Volume 4.
[06:05.46]Let's see what we got.
[06:11.96]Brush it?
[06:12.60]I just need a haircut.
[06:13.90]Leave me alone, alright?
[06:15.56]Look!
[06:16.18]I haven't had power in four days!
[06:18.64]You think I'm gonna go get a haircut?
[06:21.62]Without electricity, you think it's possible I can get in my car and go get somebody to cut my hair?
[06:27.43]No!
[06:28.67]They need power there to use the scissors.
[06:31.27]They don't just use scissors, they use buzzers!
[06:34.07]They do like a fade and... I'm not gonna go get a scissors haircut only, are you serious?
[06:41.33]All the businesses are fucking closed.
[06:42.87]It's an electric razor.
[06:52.72]Power scissors.
[06:54.60]That's not how it works.
[06:55.66]All the businesses were closed.
[06:59.47]Here we go, big moment.
[07:00.25]What's in the WWF case?
[07:05.51]Music volume four.
[07:07.15]This is four volumes worth of power.
[07:11.18]Ladies and gentlemen, introducing, from WWE Wefty Music Volume 4, Mankind!
[07:20.06]Oh, it's just one of these shitty things.
[07:22.84]It's the Pokeball with different colors, an eyeball, and a mouth, and a tail, and feet, and fins on his head.
[07:31.13]In fact, it's nothing like the Pokeball.
[07:33.33]I don't know why I'm making that reference.
[07:36.59]It's a Horn Susio Tiger.
[07:40.91]Oh, this guy sucks.
[07:44.27]Ow.
[07:46.73]What a monster.
[07:47.33]Good luck raising him.
[07:48.55]Let's check his stats.
[07:52.56]Uh, what's his name?
[07:53.28]It's gonna be... I'm gonna call him... I'm gonna call him Volume.
[07:59.44]Volume... What's four in Latin?
[08:02.92]How do you say four in Latin?
[08:06.97]You know what I'm saying?
[08:07.55]This would be a code for the V-O.
[08:10.30]What's 4 in Latin?
[08:18.66]Volume IV?
[08:20.28]That's... No, that's Roman.
[08:25.78]That's Roman.
[08:29.98]Volume.
[08:31.20]No, hold on.
[08:31.64]Wait a minute.
[08:32.04]I don't like that.
[08:35.44]That's why.
[08:36.46]Why can't this be fucking Qwerty?
[08:39.87]Volume IV.
[08:40.67]I like it.
[08:44.63]Why can't this be fucking Qwerty?
[08:46.19]Alright, Volume IV.
[08:52.33]Yeah, is it gonna be Volume IV?
[08:55.19]Roman is Latin.
[08:56.21]No, it's not.
[08:56.67]Did you see the spears?
[08:57.69]The difference in the spears?
[09:00.17]Come on.
[09:02.73]See the difference in the helmets?
[09:06.89]Now you're going to tell me that, okay, let's talk about the Pantheons.
[09:09.15]Greek and Roman Pantheons are the same, but they named them different things.
[09:14.27]Like Apollo is not the same in Roman as in Greek Pantheon.
[09:18.18]Come on.
[09:19.24]You see the different spears?
[09:21.94]Now let's freeze this.
[09:22.66]Wait, what kind of data on this guy?
[09:27.40]Go back.
[09:30.14]He actually has really good skill.
[09:31.80]His life is just terrible, though.
[09:40.66]Latin is the language.
[09:42.24]I know.
[09:42.68]I'm just kidding, guys.
[09:43.64]I have a fucking high school degree.
[09:46.44]I have a college degree.
[09:49.62]He's never run away.
[09:51.07]He's not sick.
[09:51.91]We'll freeze him.
[09:52.85]We have some more breeding to do.
[09:57.49]Put this guy in the freezer.
[10:01.15]Because we've got a couple more to do.
[10:02.31]There's at least... Yeah, we're going to get to these.
[10:05.81]There's great ones here.
[10:08.21]I'm curious what we're going to get from these.
[10:10.61]Two of my favorite video games ever made.
[10:12.77]So, let's do it up.
[10:14.33]Try and... Uh, yeah.
[10:17.41]Insert the CD.
[10:18.78]I'll show you what it is.
[10:19.62]Don't worry, we'll get it on camera here.
[10:22.52]The next one going in is... Oh boy, this is a classic.
[10:28.82]Total Distortion.
[10:31.42]One of the best PC adventure games ever made.
[10:33.58]It's going in right now.
[10:38.30]Why don't you cut your hair with a vacuum?
[10:40.71]God, fucking people, man.
[10:45.97]Just lean down and put your head in the vacuum.
[10:51.36]I'm still on camera.
[10:52.84]I didn't want to be on camera.
[10:54.76]Programs were detected that are rarely used by you.
[10:57.08]You may want to... Get out of here.
[10:58.61]What?
[10:58.79]Alright, CD's in.
[11:02.27]Uh-oh.
[11:05.93]No, there we go.
[11:06.27]It's reading.
[11:10.56]I look like a high school student from the 90s.
[11:14.12]I am a 90s kid, man.
[11:15.86]So I'm the only one that'll understand this.
[11:19.31]You know what?
[11:19.71]Fuck it.
[11:20.37]I'm gonna grow it out until it's awful.
[11:22.31]I'm gonna grow it out until you guys can't even recognize me.
[11:24.77]I'm growing out my facial hair.
[11:26.67]I'm gonna grow out my hair.
[11:28.13]Facial hair.
[11:29.33]Eyebrow hair.
[11:30.01]Eyelashes are gonna go up to like fucking here.
[11:32.86]I'm gonna be blinking.
[11:33.52]It's gonna be like a butterfly.
[11:34.58]You know what I'm saying?
[11:35.48]Oh, no way.
[11:36.76]No, no, no.
[11:38.74]You guys are gonna be disgusted in about
[11:41.19]8 to 12 years.
[11:41.61]Let's see what it is.
[11:44.55]Total distortion.
[11:46.75]Somebody just gave $100 and I can't even fucking see it.
[11:49.92]Hold on, this is important.
[11:53.00]Okay, I think I got it.
[11:58.14]We've already had one of these.
[12:00.70]The only difference is this one has a purple heart.
[12:03.11]What color is the heart?
[12:06.91]Is it red?
[12:07.69]Or is it like purple?
[12:09.17]Gel, gel, gel.
[12:13.74]It's a gel, gel, gel.
[12:16.61]This is from Total Distortion.
[12:20.15]C2.
[12:22.17]Anyways, Polo Juice, thanks for the $100, dude.
[12:24.13]Holy shit.
[12:27.27]Please, God, use this money and go to a barber.
[12:30.68]We're being cruel to be kind.
[12:32.86]I'm never getting a haircut ever again.
[12:37.64]Ever again.
[12:41.64]But thank you so much, Polo.
[12:42.86]That's a huge amount of money.
[12:43.76]Thanks for the $100, dude.
[12:56.28]Citos.
[13:02.94]I just have been too... Did I tell you?
[13:05.76]I've been busy for the last few weeks, okay?
[13:07.88]There's been a lot going on.
[13:10.03]Lost power for four days, three days ago.
[13:18.88]But no, honestly dude, thank you so much.
[13:24.12]100 fucking dollars is a lot of money, man.
[13:25.82]Alright, this guy sucks.
[13:27.56]No, I'm just gonna... Can I freeze him and then like inject him?
[13:30.77]Do you know what I mean?
[13:32.99]Can we be humane about this?
[13:34.97]Freeze him and then inject him.
[13:37.33]And then turn him into pig food.
[13:40.79]Because, I mean, 93 speed, at some point, you've got to be like Sayonara, you know what I mean?
[13:50.26]Don't freeze him.
[13:51.38]I'm freezing him.
[13:52.04]We have another one to do.
[13:53.04]You guys are going to want me to do this one.
[13:54.26]It's alright.
[13:57.70]He's a nice cube.
[13:58.52]He'll be fine.
[13:59.88]Alright, last one until we start to play the game for a little while.
[14:04.64]This one is, oh boy.
[14:07.06]Mm-hmm.
[14:09.06]Alright, well somebody's like social security number is on the back of this.
[14:12.28]Might not want to show that.
[14:14.28]What the fuck is this?
[14:16.92]I don't even want to say this.
[14:18.04]I'm afraid to even show this on camera.
[14:20.62]Because this actually might be somebody's social security number.
[14:24.59]I'm not fucking kidding.
[14:27.03]It's ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba.
[14:30.63]This is either a personal cell phone number.
[14:32.57]This might be a personal phone number.
[14:34.27]Because this game is kind of used.
[14:37.49]I'm not gonna show this on camera.
[14:38.67]This is a fucking cell phone social security number.
[14:42.02]And I ain't gonna, I ain't doing that.
[14:48.66]There.
[14:53.57]Alright, hold on.
[14:54.15]No, no, like, social security number's on the front, right?
[14:57.90]What about on the disk?
[14:59.12]So I can prove to the audience.
[15:00.70]It's like a magic trick I have to do right now.
[15:02.34]I have to, like, prove to you guys that I'm putting the CDs in.
[15:05.32]Alright, there's no social in here.
[15:07.56]So we can do it like this.
[15:10.52]Here you go.
[15:13.96]3D Movie Maker.
[15:15.56]Is the next CD that's going in.
[15:17.34]Hold on, let me, like, prove it.
[15:20.64]Stop parting your hair.
[15:22.42]I don't part my... It just naturally does it, alright?
[15:26.65]Here it is.
[15:27.81]3D Movie Maker.
[15:30.43]Let's give it a try.
[15:32.21]I don't fucking part my hair.
[15:33.38]You think I wake up in the morning and do my hair and part it like Farquaad?
[15:37.22]I don't do that.
[15:38.24]It just happens.
[15:39.10]Almost just showed the guy's social security number.
[15:41.48]That was fucking close.
[15:43.98]It's not a CD key.
[15:45.48]That's a phone number.
[15:48.09]I want to look up this area code.
[15:51.19]I want to see if this is a place.
[16:02.44]Yeah.
[16:03.46]Mm-hmm.
[16:04.04]This is a real place.
[16:05.42]This is somebody's phone number on the back of this used disk.
[16:11.84]Not fucking doing that.
[16:13.30]This is somewhere in Canada.
[16:18.04]Alright.
[16:18.72]Alright, shrine.
[16:23.38]Let's see what we get from, let's hopefully, I hope we get a rat out of this.
[16:25.66]I really do.
[16:29.40]I'm not gonna call, what do you think I am?
[16:33.44]I'm not gonna call somebody's fucking phone number on stream.
[16:36.18]What am I gonna be like?
[16:36.90]Oh, hey, what's up?
[16:38.20]What are you doing?
[16:39.26]Yeah, I'm just like calling your house on... I'm a streamer.
[16:42.93]There's like... How many people are even watching?
[16:45.11]I don't even know.
[16:49.29]There's like 1,600 people watching me call you right now.
[16:55.91]Yeah, what's up?
[16:57.31]Don't you think that's funny?
[16:58.05]1,600 people are...
[17:02.59]I guess that's... I'm trying to eat dinner with my family, dude.
[17:07.67]Can I help you with something?
[17:09.64]Yeah, I wonder what kind of CD we'll get from you.
[17:15.00]Hang up!
[17:15.60]Let me break.
[17:22.81]Where's the Monster Rancher CD?
[17:28.32]So many discs.
[17:29.82]There are so many fucking discs on this table.
[17:32.56]I don't know where the Monster Rancher CD is now.
[17:34.54]Where did it go?
[17:37.06]There are 40 discs out just lying around.
[17:39.14]Now that's the Gremlin Special Edition.
[17:42.94]That's Celine Dion.
[17:44.84]What did I do with it?
[17:46.81]Did I have an empty PlayStation 1?
[17:48.57]That's funny.
[17:54.49]Got it.
[18:03.49]Can we load this or what?
[18:09.32]Big moment.
[18:11.06]3D Movie Maker, come on, give us a rat.
[18:16.24]Almost lost Rat Movie.
[18:18.78]It's probably gonna be like another dinosaur.
[18:21.46]No?
[18:22.14]It is, oh baby!
[18:26.28]It's a rat ceratorpus rex!
[18:29.69]It's a rat ceratops!
[18:31.19]Rat ceratorpus!
[18:37.39]Triceratops.
[18:38.55]Rat-ceratorpus.
[18:40.59]Rat-ceratops.
[18:41.49]Am I saying that right?
[18:44.45]What a monster.
[18:45.01]Good luck raising him.
[18:50.31]Okay, rat.
[18:51.75]Triceratops, but he's a rat.
[18:53.81]Rat-ceratorpus.
[18:56.87]Rat-ceratorpus.
[18:59.39]Rat-ceratorpus.
[19:08.68]Ratseratorpus.
[19:11.06]There's no way.
[19:11.58]Is there a P?
[19:18.67]Shit.
[19:20.19]Ratserator.
[19:21.23]Easy.
[19:22.57]Ratserator.
[19:24.59]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[19:25.75]Ratseratops.
[19:29.09]Fuck.
[19:30.29]Ratseratops.
[19:35.16]Oh, my God.
[19:35.84]Am I a child?
[19:37.22]There we go.
[19:44.24]Ratseratops.
[19:47.00]Ratseratops.
[19:47.64]Should it be Ratseratops?
[19:48.40]I want it to be Ratseratorpus.
[19:49.74]This is bullshit.
[19:52.30]It just barely will fit too.
[19:58.23]Ratseratops.
[20:02.39]That added an R there for no reason.
[20:04.37]Alright.
[20:05.23]Data.
[20:08.14]Very fast.
[20:08.82]Very speedy.
[20:10.56]Highly skilled.
[20:12.32]Just really bad defense.
[20:18.24]Alright, let's go make some money.
[20:19.84]We've made... Should I raise him a little bit?
[20:22.73]He sucks.
[20:23.21]He doesn't suck that much.
[20:24.19]He kind of sucks.
[20:26.23]I mean, he sucks, but he doesn't suck that much.
[20:29.37]It's just Sonic the Hedgehog.
[20:31.87]Kind of.
[20:34.84]Sell him.
[20:35.30]Freeze him.
[20:35.96]He sucks.
[20:38.58]Who should I take out instead?
[20:56.57]The worm you want to bring back?
[20:58.04]Alright, let's take a look.
[20:59.76]Who do we want to actually work with?
[21:02.18]We have Free, Jaxrex D-Sponge, Splishio, Volume V, Seedoss, or Rat-Seratorps.
[21:12.38]What is Free?
[21:15.15]Free is actually pretty good.
[21:21.33]Jaxrex...
[21:23.65]Jaxrex is okay.
[21:24.67]You want me to bring back Splishio?
[21:29.35]Well, I think we're going to have to do a poll here.
[21:31.03]We really are.
[21:32.21]You guys can't decide.
[21:34.15]Let's do this democratically.
[21:35.15]Alright, revive.
[21:37.63]Who are we actually going to work with here?
[21:39.37]And yes, all of them are getting put on the poll.
[21:41.41]So you better make it count.
[21:43.80]I'm not doing a second poll, by the way.
[21:45.38]So make it actually count.
[21:49.98]And I'm gonna misspell the fuck out of this, I don't even care.
[21:52.32]Cause we gotta get- we gotta get going.
[21:56.99]Free... Jex... Rex... D-Sponge... Splishio- His name is so fucked up, whatever, you know who it is.
[22:06.89]Volume... Seados... Or... Rat... Ceratops.
[22:16.97]Okay.
[22:17.63]Please vote on this.
[22:19.05]Hopefully you can see it.
[22:19.97]Because sometimes Twitch does this to me where I can't even type in my own chat.
[22:24.78]There you go.
[22:25.92]Who do you guys want to play with?
[22:27.40]We're going to play with this.
[22:29.30]By the way, this character is going to be used for the next hour.
[22:31.42]So don't be a memer about this.
[22:33.80]Don't be like a jokester about this shit.
[22:41.35]Alright, Splishio is currently winning.
[22:43.07]D-Sponge is actually getting some traction though.
[22:49.34]Splishio's probably just gonna take it.
[22:52.45]Worm is just kicking everybody's ass.
[22:53.67]Wait, you're gonna play this game for an hour?
[22:56.77]Yeah, this game's awesome!
[22:59.31]This game is really, actually really fun.
[23:03.61]Plus, um, you know, I haven't been able to prepare anything else, because I've had no power for four days.
[23:12.20]So, this is what we're doing tonight!
[23:15.96]You know?
[23:20.24]Alright, that's it.
[23:21.94]Splishio is winning by way too much.
[23:24.50]He's just taken off with the presidency.
[23:26.56]Thank you for playing.
[23:27.24]Thank you for voting.
[23:29.08]Splishio is the winner.
[23:33.01]Excuses.
[23:34.71]Yeah, let me hook up myself to a generator.
[23:39.39]I need like eight generators to figure out what I'm going to stream on Tuesday.
[23:42.79]Alright, so we got... There he is.
[23:48.01]Our good friend.
[23:49.81]He sucks, man.
[23:51.21]He really does.
[23:51.97]Holy shit, he is awful.
[23:54.17]He is fucking awful.
[23:57.85]He has no redeeming qualities.
[23:59.45]He just has a lot of health.
[24:00.63]That's it.
[24:02.49]Jax Rex is better than him at level 1.
[24:04.35]Oh my god.
[24:13.50]Wake up.
[24:17.34]He's just the cutest one.
[24:18.40]That's why you guys want me to play with him.
[24:21.08]He just happens to be the cutest one.
[24:24.60]Send him back to the ranch.
[24:27.49]Uh-huh.
[24:33.21]He has a D grade.
[24:38.51]He's very well.
[24:39.15]Alright, this is where somebody told me that they... I was laughing.
[24:42.32]Okay, I woke up.
[24:44.00]By the way, I'm gonna like turn the music down here for a second.
[24:47.47]Because I'll stop laughing if I hear it.
[24:51.17]When we streamed this, like, a few days ago, this song, somebody was saying that these songs, they were begging me to turn the sound off.
[25:00.82]Because they were going to hear it in their sleep.
[25:02.84]And they were going to hear it over and over again.
[25:04.18]And it was, like, actually driving them fucking crazy during the stream.
[25:07.35]So, like, I've been in darkness for three straight days and I shit you not, the guy goes to work in Monster Rancher song is all I could hear.
[25:20.29]I was literally going to the fridge and trying to like clean my fridge and all I could hear was that song every time I did a task.
[25:26.32]So that guy was not wrong.
[25:29.62]And I was just cracking up about it.
[25:31.04]Like every time I would go to like shake the flashlight or put in new batteries, that song would play.
[25:39.76]You'll hear, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
[25:41.48]Because you're gonna be able to hear, you're gonna hear it, like, right now.
[25:46.01]This song... Alright, what does he, what does he need?
[25:51.01]He needs power, he needs everything.
[25:52.57]He's so bad!
[25:53.39]This, he's awful!
[25:54.41]Alright, you ready?
[25:57.67]So, I would get up from my seat, whatever I was doing, in total pitch blackness, and hear this song.
[26:20.02]Every fucking time.
[26:22.56]It was driving me fucking crazy.
[26:24.02]And this song too.
[26:25.22]That's why I don't even want to listen to this.
[26:27.22]I might even take out the headphones.
[26:29.42]It's gonna happen again.
[26:30.09]I'm gonna lose power and I'm gonna have to only hear this.
[26:36.37]Now you're cursed.
[26:37.61]Turn up the work song.
[26:38.69]No, I'm not doing it louder than that.
[26:40.66]I'm not driving everybody insane.
[26:44.06]He's definitely not ready for this.
[26:51.15]I mean, he sucks.
[26:52.29]He's not going to be able to fight these guys at D level.
[26:56.67]He's currently a failing monster.
[26:59.09]He's not even a passing monster at this point.
[27:00.91]He's ready.
[27:02.62]You think he's ready?
[27:03.78]Yeah, we're getting another storm tomorrow.
[27:07.64]Yeah, guys, I might not see you for another week.
[27:11.98]You think I can trust him?
[27:14.70]Alright.
[27:16.48]Let's see.
[27:16.85]Participate.
[27:17.31]Let's see if he can do it.
[27:22.85]Believe in him.
[27:25.73]He's going to be outmatched in every single category by everybody.
[27:30.07]Yeah, we're getting like another 10 inches of snow over the whole state of Massachusetts tomorrow.
[27:35.53]Can't wait to stream one time this week.
[27:37.15]It's going to be great.
[27:42.01]Delete the monster that loses?
[27:43.19]Well, then we'd run out real quick.
[27:45.81]Alright.
[27:46.09]Let's see.
[27:47.83]This is six battles, by the way.
[27:54.87]I hope he fails so you can pick D-Sponge, the superior Lovecraftian nightmare creature.
[28:04.22]Let's see the comparison.
[28:05.22]The tail of the tape!
[28:07.60]Well, I can do that better.
[28:08.24]The tail of the tape!
[28:12.30]That's a UFC reference for all you fucking jokers.
[28:14.42]Actually, he is better.
[28:18.00]Than this guy, at least.
[28:21.64]Turn up the music every time a monster loses.
[28:25.17]Why would you want that?
[28:28.47]Alright, let me remember how to play the game.
[28:30.16]Let's move back and forth.
[28:32.44]Yeah, alright.
[28:32.76]Let's go with a... We need a higher percentage here.
[28:38.93]Let him waste his will.
[28:42.35]Sorry, I can take a couple of hits because I'm going to smoke him here in a second.
[28:53.55]Really?
[28:53.85]At least he got confused, too.
[28:55.83]99%, there it is.
[28:58.46]Did I really just get the 1% to not hit?
[29:01.28]It just happened.
[29:01.84]Are you fucking serious?
[29:07.90]Well, that was a huge amount of damage.
[29:13.64]There it is.
[29:15.48]I just glitched him out.
[29:16.12]One more like that, and I got this victory here.
[29:23.92]Stay back.
[29:24.92]I'll get a TKO.
[29:25.66]Why don't you just crit me for a hundred?
[29:32.13]Nope, no TKO here.
[29:33.11]Nice work.
[29:45.13]Didn't see this last time, the game looks surprisingly fun.
[29:47.53]It is, it's awesome.
[29:50.37]That's why I want to play... If not, I don't think I'm going to play all of them.
[29:53.51]Some of them are really badly rated.
[29:55.92]But the first three games... And the ones that go on PlayStation 2 are equally as fun, I guess.
[30:00.98]And they're probably a little more in-depth.
[30:03.60]So, expect you to see... This game, this series, on the channel, for sure.
[30:10.20]Alright, let's go against Mopeto.
[30:17.02]I'm playing this on PlayStation 1.
[30:21.69]Monster Rancher 3 is amazing.
[30:23.41]Yeah.
[30:24.45]This is the one I remember playing when I was younger.
[30:27.43]Monster Rancher 3, though, I don't think I've ever played it.
[30:31.21]He's like a rock tiger.
[30:32.23]This is going to be bad.
[30:32.97]He's going to have huge defense.
[30:36.56]Oh my god.
[30:37.40]Yeah, good luck with this one.
[30:38.20]We lose.
[30:39.68]I just have to... Oh man, look at every category.
[30:42.22]This guy's going to kick my ass.
[30:45.32]I don't even... He is better in every single category except for life.
[30:49.60]I wonder if I can just...
[30:53.76]Nah, this is pretty much a game over.
[30:55.28]I'm going to try.
[31:01.58]I might just want to die.
[31:02.42]He's at 68% already.
[31:08.23]We can try to win.
[31:09.85]Maybe if he runs out of will.
[31:10.79]I'm going to try to hold out until he runs out of will.
[31:16.55]That's our only real opportunity here.
[31:17.91]Because then we can win by percentage.
[31:22.95]Had to hit that.
[31:28.19]Wait a minute here.
[31:29.36]Wait a minute here.
[31:32.00]Ugh!
[31:38.38]Dodge it!
[31:38.88]Come on!
[31:39.38]I need a higher percentage of this!
[31:44.02]Oh, come on!
[31:46.42]Come on!
[31:47.04]I didn't get any of those!
[31:51.88]Well, this is one we were going to lose anyways.
[31:54.14]Don't say that yet.
[31:54.80]Come on.
[31:56.73]Don't say that yet.
[31:57.39]Come on.
[31:58.95]Oh, don't say it yet.
[31:59.67]Come on.
[32:04.29]Oh.
[32:06.11]Oh.
[32:07.15]Yes.
[32:16.15]Wow.
[32:17.09]That was actually pretty lucky.
[32:21.15]That was by far the hardest guy we're probably gonna see.
[32:24.05]Michael has decided to withdraw, so Splishio wins.
[32:30.42]The next opponent gave up, he was scared.
[32:34.46]Michael is just a default skin... of that particular monster type.
[32:40.56]That guy can't even afford a fucking... the... the... in-game currency skin.
[32:45.67]Not the pay-for skin.
[32:51.88]Alright, who we got?
[32:53.40]We got 3-0.
[32:53.86]Who's Gurren?
[32:56.32]Gurren is 2-1.
[32:57.06]Who did he lose to?
[33:02.20]Who did he lose to?
[33:03.68]2-1.
[33:05.62]I can't even see who he lost to.
[33:06.74]I always have trouble with these guys, though.
[33:09.76]They have a lot of health.
[33:16.10]We might actually just take this.
[33:23.74]I lost to... He lost to Whirl.
[33:26.06]Okay.
[33:28.20]I did beat this guy last time, but he's grown in power and grown in size.
[33:32.69]He's definitely much bigger than he was.
[33:35.35]What about his stats?
[33:38.35]Okay.
[33:39.11]He has terrible skill, terrible speed, but man, if you get hit once... Alright.
[33:46.82]I'm just gonna dance around him.
[33:53.50]He hits me with a couple of those kicks.
[33:56.08]Oh boy, oh boy.
[33:57.10]That's exactly what I didn't want to have happen.
[33:59.82]It's alright.
[34:03.27]His defense is so high.
[34:08.03]And one hit is all it took.
[34:13.79]Just don't get hit again.
[34:14.49]46%.
[34:14.51]I don't want to take the swing.
[34:19.42]I don't want to take the swing.
[34:20.46]I don't want to take the swing, but I might have to.
[34:23.07]98%!
[34:23.09]Oh, why are you confused?
[34:32.89]Fuck!
[34:35.83]Fuck!
[34:38.03]Good!
[34:38.49]Don't get hit again!
[34:40.14]Don't get hit again!
[34:48.52]It's like... Like, what was I supposed to do against this guy?
[34:54.15]He just had to hit me with two fucking moves.
[35:01.27]You know what?
[35:01.71]It's still possible to win though.
[35:08.67]That's a lot of damage.
[35:09.63]3-1.
[35:13.82]Whirl is 4-0.
[35:20.34]Why?
[35:22.56]No one has beat Whirl.
[35:26.47]The thing is, I'd rather face the quicker, smaller enemies, because the big guys, if they hit you once, it just sucks.
[35:36.49]We fought this guy.
[35:36.97]Did we lose to this guy last time?
[35:43.42]Hmm.
[35:44.14]Well, I can see why.
[35:45.52]Power is... It's not going to be about the power.
[35:48.18]It's going to be about how much more skill he has.
[35:51.36]He's not that much faster, and I'm more happy... Eh.
[35:54.58]It's doable, but still, percentage-wise, looks like it's not going to go in our favor.
[36:00.24]Okay, I'm going to go with that.
[36:06.28]Okay, that's fine.
[36:10.19]That's not fine.
[36:15.44]Prickly.
[36:15.86]Dickhead.
[36:17.58]Dickhead.
[36:22.66]There it is.
[36:25.20]There it is!
[36:26.08]Twice in a row.
[36:29.56]Don't get cocky.
[36:36.97]Getting cocky right now.
[36:39.31]Okay, I gotta get cocky though.
[36:50.78]God damn it!
[36:53.88]No!
[36:55.82]It's gonna be so close!
[36:57.18]Yes!
[36:57.76]That's it.
[37:05.17]Oh, that's a tie.
[37:07.79]Four and one, four and one?
[37:13.31]I think so, right?
[37:18.74]Oh, the monsters are tied, so we will now have a final showdown.
[37:23.52]Although they are monsters with equal records, Splishio can outfight them one more.
[37:27.43]Alright.
[37:30.43]This is the first place.
[37:33.73]We've got to try to... I'm going to get squished.
[37:42.45]I think I might just go with the spam technique.
[37:45.37]Because honestly, if he gets one good roll, I'm dead.
[37:48.53]So might as well just try to roll the dice, because that's what he's going to be doing.
[37:53.10]This is for a D. We're going to get a passing letter grade if we win this.
[38:02.66]Let's do it.
[38:05.57]Right off the bat.
[38:08.81]Nice dice roll.
[38:12.97]I'm not doing it until I get to 50.
[38:15.37]At least over 50%.
[38:17.17]Got it.
[38:18.55]Alright, slow down, slow down.
[38:22.08]No sense in wasting Will.
[38:29.90]Got it.
[38:30.26]Okay.
[38:32.77]Nice.
[38:32.95]Still hasn't been hit yet.
[38:34.01]Keep the Will up.
[38:35.19]He's at 19%.
[38:35.45]47... 94!
[38:41.55]Okay, that's not good.
[38:43.23]That's not good.
[38:51.49]Damn it!
[38:52.72]Damn it!
[38:53.24]No!
[38:54.18]No!
[38:57.12]No!
[38:58.22]No!
[38:59.96]Oh, I gotta get a hit here.
[39:01.00]I gotta get a big hit.
[39:03.86]No, it's over.
[39:06.26]He's gonna move by percentage, I think.
[39:07.98]Yeah, he is.
[39:12.24]Oh well.
[39:20.85]It's just based on... I had a 40% chance almost the whole time.
[39:28.39]Oh well.
[39:29.25]Don't matter, you still get second place.
[39:30.31]You get tons of money.
[39:35.68]What about my fame?
[39:36.38]35 friends!
[39:39.63]Splishio sucks.
[39:41.79]He kind of does.
[39:43.31]I mean, he's cool.
[39:45.44]But we have, like, four other characters that have, like, 160 in some of their stats.
[39:51.50]I'm gonna encourage him.
[39:55.78]I think I have, like, a pushback move, too.
[39:57.46]Don't I?
[39:57.72]How do I do that?
[40:01.33]Let's just give him fish.
[40:03.95]What's the button to do?
[40:05.07]When you see the two fists, right?
[40:06.51]That's when you can do a combination, I think, and move somebody back.
[40:10.41]Oh, sleep.
[40:17.18]Combine him with the wall?
[40:23.04]He lost because he didn't push.
[40:24.32]Don't blame Wormy.
[40:27.14]Oh, come on.
[40:27.98]The guy had to land two attacks on me for me to lose.
[40:34.12]It's square?
[40:34.74]I'll try to remember that the next time.
[40:38.44]Alright, let's... Will it evolve?
[40:44.36]Uh, you have to combine monsters for them to technically evolve.
[40:53.24]You want to combine them with the wall?
[40:54.62]Should we just combine them with the wall?
[40:59.24]You're being too firm with him.
[41:00.30]I just let him sleep for a week!
[41:03.53]You want a worm wall?
[41:06.92]Ultimate machine of death?
[41:07.94]Alright.
[41:10.78]The game is too loud.
[41:14.34]God damn it.
[41:15.32]Alright, we're gonna combine them with the wall.
[41:16.78]Fuck it.
[41:18.32]Let's do it.
[41:25.03]Worm and wall.
[41:26.69]Going together.
[41:30.37]You want to do a pull?
[41:31.79]Pull?
[41:32.03]Okay.
[41:33.23]This is... Are we combining the worm and the wall?
[41:35.73]Here's the next poll.
[41:36.95]This is going to be a choose your own monster stream.
[41:42.93]I wonder if you... Overwhelmingly.
[41:44.24]I wonder.
[41:45.18]Let's see.
[41:48.00]This is to combine worm and wall.
[41:57.68]Here we go.
[42:06.84]There you go.
[42:10.56]Should we combine the worm and the wall?
[42:15.08]This one I'm actually pretty interested in the outcome of our democracy.
[42:18.57]Wow, nevermind.
[42:19.31]71% say yes.
[42:21.11]Damn.
[42:21.57]I didn't think it was gonna be this far out of reach for the nose.
[42:32.88]Alright, looks like that's what we're doing.
[42:38.37]Lab.
[42:41.50]Freeze them.
[42:42.38]Right?
[42:42.62]So then you combine them when they're frozen.
[42:48.04]Here we go.
[42:48.82]Combine.
[42:51.00]500 gold to combine.
[42:51.98]That's fine.
[42:53.81]Who's going in?
[42:55.75]D-Sponge.
[42:57.85]Proceed.
[43:01.11]And... Splishio.
[43:02.79]Proceed.
[43:04.43]Proceed.
[43:07.77]Sobo and pole worm.
[43:09.81]Do you want to add an item?
[43:10.71]I don't have any items.
[43:16.55]I hope this was a right idea because here it goes.
[43:19.72]A nice combination.
[43:20.44]You'll surely get a better one.
[43:21.56]Proceed.
[43:27.40]Watch us get one of those.
[43:28.30]Watch us get the default skin thing.
[43:30.32]What is it?
[43:31.54]Oh boy.
[43:32.81]It is actually a worm wall.
[43:37.15]It has, plus she has eyes up there.
[43:40.93]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[43:42.20]It's a mono worm.
[43:44.70]You guys didn't want to do this?
[43:46.00]That's a funny looking monster.
[43:52.20]Now it's time to kick ass.
[43:54.16]Alright, we need a good name now.
[44:00.24]Um, Flesh Wall.
[44:05.62]What do you mean RIP Wormy?
[44:07.08]He's here.
[44:08.94]This is his offspring.
[44:11.22]This is his genetic offspring.
[44:16.16]Spongio?
[44:19.95]I like Wormwall.
[44:22.47]Meatloaf?
[44:24.23]Alright, fine.
[44:24.75]Let's go with Raw Meatloaf.
[44:27.31]That name sucks, but I like it.
[44:35.90]Raw meatloaf and peas.
[44:38.50]This has nothing to do with the last two characters we had in here.
[44:47.85]It perfectly fits.
[44:52.06]Raw meatloaf.
[44:57.34]Somehow, the stats are worse.
[45:05.48]Power went down.
[45:06.18]Defense went up.
[45:07.96]Skill went down.
[45:08.96]Speed went down.
[45:14.07]Great.
[45:15.73]I like block a fucking burnt tofu.
[45:19.69]Okay, let me... Let's go back, back, back.
[45:28.52]What's the...
[45:34.52]Body slam, probe attack.
[45:37.30]I just want to see his moves.
[45:40.82]Body slam, tackle.
[45:41.75]These are pretty normal.
[45:42.81]Hit percentage, A, B, and then probe.
[45:45.95]It's a B in damage.
[45:48.49]That's the highest damage I think I've seen.
[45:52.85]Interesting.
[45:53.41]Okay.
[45:54.45]So what does this guy need for stats?
[46:01.10]This is what I want to know.
[46:01.86]What do you think we should do for him?
[46:06.09]Body slam and tackle are the same thing.
[46:08.45]Yeah, they kind of are.
[46:14.92]Just power.
[46:16.28]Just all power.
[46:18.86]So his probe, so his alien probe is more effective.
[46:23.36]Power, one third.
[46:24.14]His power is pretty terrible.
[46:25.39]Let's just work him out.
[46:28.41]All power.
[46:33.74]Alright, let's go.
[46:34.62]Go to work.
[46:35.94]Do I have enough for training?
[46:36.78]Not really.
[46:37.20]I want a power and... Do I give a fuck about speed?
[46:43.32]Yeah, his speed's awful.
[46:44.34]We need... Let's just do some power first.
[46:50.39]Go on, buddy.
[46:55.59]He almost just failed that.
[46:57.15]Lucky.
[47:04.53]Somebody in chat just wrote You know in all lowercase they weren't they weren't really they weren't yelling they weren't mad or anything.
[47:11.73]They just said I don't like him Like yeah, you know I can neither do I he kind of sucks He sucks let's be real to forget about who he's made out of this guy sucks I Don't want this guy
[47:39.95]Do you guys really want to see this for the next hour?
[47:41.67]I mean, his power went up a lot.
[47:48.15]Seems like he's not as tired.
[47:49.27]Let's give him fish.
[47:51.41]Always fish.
[47:54.82]Okay, for a second I thought it just told me that I gave him raw meatloaf.
[47:57.86]I was like, I didn't choose that.
[47:59.50]I didn't give him raw fucking meatloaf.
[48:00.86]That's gross.
[48:06.28]Fuse him again.
[48:07.06]With what?
[48:09.15]What?
[48:17.48]Raw Meatloaf did not finish his work.
[48:19.98]Hold on, wait, did he just go to sleep?
[48:23.70]Just fuse them all.
[48:25.62]Fuse everyone.
[48:26.40]No, I'm not gonna fuse everyone.
[48:27.90]That's not how it works.
[48:41.44]Splishio died for this.
[48:43.14]Splishio did not die, he is here.
[48:47.33]See, did you hear him?
[48:49.01]That was the way that he used to... Remember that?
[48:50.37]Remember that?
[48:50.69]Remember how he used to sound like that?
[48:55.36]Is he actually very tired?
[48:56.68]God damn it, this guy sucks.
[49:10.30]He's... I'm gaining loyalty, but not even doing anything.
[49:14.23]We need to... He needs to have at least 160 power.
[49:15.55]He just does.
[49:18.88]I refuse any... And that's the second time you've failed.
[49:23.32]No, we're not going to punish him twice in a row.
[49:28.14]Although I will tell you, it's odd that... Odd that Splishio was constantly... What is JexRex doing?
[49:41.63]How are you, sir?
[49:45.35]Thank you.
[49:49.08]To Jeremy.
[49:50.78]What could this be?
[49:52.40]Training fees reduced this month only.
[49:54.54]See training office for details.
[49:58.11]Training, maybe it's his time.
[50:02.81]That sounds good.
[50:06.35]You will miss the next official battle.
[50:08.05]That's fine.
[50:08.57]He's not ready.
[50:13.24]Do you see our ad?
[50:14.00]As it says, we're now offering discount rates on our training.
[50:17.00]Please select one.
[50:20.46]Uh, we want power, right?
[50:23.00]Life, skill, and intelligence.
[50:24.36]What do you think?
[50:28.04]Skill?
[50:31.26]Skill or life?
[50:32.96]Which one?
[50:33.96]There's no power.
[50:41.32]Skill.
[50:43.20]Yeah.
[50:45.18]I agree.
[50:49.08]Yeah, there is no speed, but this is discounted, you know what I'm saying?
[50:52.10]We want to see what we can get for the discounted rate.
[50:54.74]That was, that's it?
[50:55.94]That's 50% off.
[50:57.22]Yes, do it, please.
[51:00.90]However, galleon monel monsters don't look like living creatures.
[51:07.43]Well, come to think of it, they can pop out of the, they can pop out of their limbs.
[51:12.57]I wonder if someone's inside.
[51:15.32]Don't be silly.
[51:17.00]Oh, I guess not.
[51:18.60]It's just a rum- are you gonna like deny me service because I have a certain monster type?
[51:27.19]They say ones that don't resemble living creatures have another monster living inside or something.
[51:31.91]I don't care- train my fucking monster.
[51:37.65]Forget it.
[51:37.99]It's just a rumor.
[51:38.95]Happy training.
[51:40.53]What?
[51:42.83]Wormy's in there alive.
[51:46.02]So?
[51:46.32]I know, I combined them.
[51:52.48]That's okay.
[51:55.98]Get it right every time.
[52:00.51]Punish.
[52:06.25]Punish!
[52:08.83]What a fucking waste of money.
[52:14.38]Fucking loser.
[52:16.50]That's a thousand dollars.
[52:18.10]That's a thousand dollars.
[52:34.70]For six skill.
[52:37.48]Yeah, great.
[52:48.82]I could have gotten 6 skill for free.
[52:55.79]What a fucking pain in the ass.
[52:59.67]Good thing that wasn't $2000 like normal.
[53:02.65]That would have been a monumental waste of time.
[53:11.03]Please delete this fucking character.
[53:13.15]It's too late.
[53:14.25]You guys asked for this.
[53:16.17]There was a poll and everything.
[53:17.91]This was you guys, the people voted for this.
[53:21.84]This was a character that... Look, there was probably two hours of game time on Splishio, right?
[53:27.98]Combined with the wall.
[53:29.04]These are the only two characters that have actually fought in a tournament.
[53:32.60]And they're the only ones that I have here.
[53:34.36]We have to go back to square one if you want to do another character.
[53:37.02]This is what we're getting raw meatloaf for the next three hours.
[53:39.74]You guys asked for this.
[53:46.79]He didn't even do his work.
[53:48.31]What the fuck?
[53:49.09]This guy's the worst.
[53:52.17]That's the second time.
[53:53.73]The second time I've told him to go to work and he just went to sleep instead.
[53:57.75]After he just slept for like a full week.
[54:04.62]Fusing with Jax Rex?
[54:05.68]No.
[54:05.94]This is like tainted.
[54:07.68]Tainted.
[54:10.88]This combination is apparently cursed.
[54:16.90]You got raw meat.
[54:17.76]I'm not going to combine raw meat with a living animal.
[54:22.05]Salmonella?
[54:24.19]Right?
[54:25.47]E. coli?
[54:26.97]Tapeworms?
[54:27.67]You ever had a tapeworm before?
[54:29.71]Not good.
[54:34.75]We have to do at least one tournament with him just to see how he is in battle.
[54:37.69]We have to give him a chance.
[54:39.31]It's not fair either way.
[54:41.03]It's hard to give somebody a chance when they fail every time.
[54:44.11]You know?
[54:51.56]As an adult, as a parent, this is my child here.
[54:57.79]Come on, you can't just get Fs.
[55:01.47]At least get a D. Bad parent expect what?
[55:13.11]Because I expect Ds?
[55:17.32]That's pretty lenient, sorry guys.
[55:21.40]Look, just pass.
[55:22.74]As long as you get Ds.
[55:26.94]Oh my God, he can't even get a D. He's failed over and over again.
[55:32.05]We've trained 10 fucking times.
[55:34.11]He's costed me so much money.
[55:39.19]I'm running out of money.
[55:40.65]I'm trying to work for money and I can't get it.
[55:43.47]I'm just spending money on this thing.
[55:50.71]Oh my fucking god.
[55:51.95]Okay, I gotta pee.
[55:53.29]And then I don't know what to do about this.
[56:04.15]I gotta pee.
[56:05.91]You can just watch him be funny for like five minutes.
[56:08.47]I'm gonna take a piss.
[56:16.13]See you in two seconds.
[58:34.81]And we're back from that commercial break.
[58:40.39]Line?
[58:40.83]I don't know.
[58:41.17]Line?
[58:41.51]What's my line?
[58:45.27]I wish that would happen in, like, the news or something.
[58:47.95]Wouldn't that be funny?
[58:51.39]Like, the news anchor is sitting there.
[58:53.53]Got all the lights and cameras, everything's pointing at him.
[58:55.07]He's got, like, cool graphics and stuff pop up.
[58:58.80]He sends it off.
[59:00.88]And more news when we come back from this commercial break.
[59:03.71]See you then.
[59:06.41]The news plays out.
[59:07.25]They see a couple of Ford commercials.
[59:10.37]See a couple of Chevy commercials.
[59:13.03]Then he comes back.
[59:15.22]Comes back to him.
[59:16.54]And he's like, and we're back.
[59:19.26]I don't know.
[59:21.06]What's the next line?
[59:22.86]I don't understand what I do next.
[59:25.95]And he fucking like rips his shirt open, and there's like a huge fucking like dragon tattoo on him.
[59:31.19]I don't know why there'd be a dragon, but... End this joke.
[59:36.30]I'm not making a joke.
[59:37.24]I'm just saying, I'm thinking of funny.
[59:38.70]I'm thinking of, wouldn't it be funny if... Look.
[59:42.58]There's a difference.
[59:43.46]Let me show you something.
[59:50.51]Right?
[59:52.03]Joke versus wouldn't it be funny if is not a joke.
[59:57.20]It's a wouldn't it be funny if.
[59:59.44]They're not the same thing.
[60:08.73]No, okay, I thought he failed again.
[60:09.73]There's making a bad joke and saying a bad joke.
[60:13.37]No, there's making a joke.
[60:16.71]A joke would be like it comes back from the commercial.
[60:22.70]And all of a sudden, the guy starts talking about a priest, a rabbi, and an Englishman all going to the store at the same time.
[60:30.90]And one ducks under the bar, and the other guy hits his head on the bar.
[60:34.16]And then finally, the guy comes out and says, who painted my horse's testicles yellow?
[60:41.82]That's a joke.
[60:43.98]I'm making an observation.
[60:53.19]I don't know.
[60:55.31]Cook the meat.
[60:56.55]No, he doesn't deserve it.
[61:02.29]What a joke.
[61:03.35]Alright, let's do... What is he currently at?
[61:15.98]153 for power.
[61:18.10]Let's do 160 and I'll be comfortable.
[61:20.38]You know what I'm saying?
[61:28.51]This bar of chocolate is the first thing... No, no punishing.
[61:34.49]You can't punish him.
[61:41.73]This guy's just a Hershey bar.
[61:45.21]But really old.
[61:47.13]That was in the wrapper for way too long.
[61:50.91]You know, I should have named this guy Bomb Shelter Hershey Bar.
[61:56.39]Because he would open it up and it would be covered in dust and shit.
[61:59.77]And the two eyes would just mold.
[62:07.48]Well... Let's try this again.
[62:16.10]Good.
[62:19.36]He's intelligent, so I want him to have power for the tackles.
[62:21.66]It's important.
[62:32.67]It's gonna shoot lasers.
[62:33.89]Yeah, we wanted to shoot lasers, and we want the tackles to be incredibly debilitating.
[62:41.73]He should be in good shape.
[62:44.49]Let's do it.
[62:45.19]Battle.
[62:45.59]Let's see what he can do.
[62:46.75]He can only do E. Let's give it a try.
[62:54.25]Don't get KO'd.
[63:01.08]Should have named him Shit Brick.
[63:04.52]What the fuck?
[63:08.98]See, here's the anchor.
[63:10.62]Ladies and gentlemen, they are now beginning the battle.
[63:13.81]A priest, a rabbi, and an Englishman.
[63:17.91]What's my line?
[63:18.55]Alright, raw meatloaf.
[63:21.85]We fought this guy before.
[63:23.07]This guy's terrible.
[63:37.59]We're probably going to own this dude.
[63:43.93]Let's check the stats.
[63:51.76]Oh, scared.
[64:11.57]I don't even have to try.
[64:13.07]Yeah, this is E-level.
[64:24.20]We played against these guys already.
[64:25.62]These guys are terrible.
[64:27.70]Remember Broccoli Horse?
[64:30.29]He wasn't very good.
[64:35.93]Free Wormy.
[64:53.93]The Mario whomp whatever turd block That's it for damage Alright, get confused again I want to do this Let's hope we get it ready
[65:19.10]Going for the move!
[65:19.72]Come on!
[65:20.03]Tackle!
[65:20.79]Attack!
[65:22.69]Nice job!
[65:23.15]Again!
[65:25.43]Hit him again!
[65:27.63]One more time!
[65:29.53]Dammit.
[65:30.51]I didn't get to do my joke!
[65:36.41]Turn the game volume up?
[65:37.63]Oh shit!
[65:38.36]There you go.
[65:43.14]Yeah, sorry.
[65:43.74]I didn't get to do my JOKE!
[66:11.46]Take a shower?
[66:13.00]Why do you guys think I don't clean myself?
[66:15.89]Oh my fucking god.
[66:16.99]Yeah, I'm just a dirty fucking guy.
[66:19.59]I don't even clean myself.
[66:23.99]I haven't had a haircut in a little while.
[66:25.95]Therefore, I don't clean my body.
[66:35.70]Eat shit, buddy.
[66:39.16]No, not the guy that said that.
[66:40.48]I'm talking about the yellow dinosaur.
[66:56.54]The meatloaf is doing well because the meatloaf is currently at way higher tier than these monsters are.
[67:04.44]So he just has to go through the ranks.
[67:06.38]This is just a smurf account, right?
[67:07.70]This is the same idea as if your buddy has League of Legends, and he gets to champion class, and then you get the game, and he's like, oh, don't worry, I'll make an account with you, and he makes a fucking smurf account and stomps the whole lower ranks.
[67:19.71]That's what just happened.
[67:22.21]Like, you and him combine DNA, and then he makes a smurf.
[67:32.57]But why would you need to do that?
[67:33.39]You wouldn't need to... No, you just have to make an account.
[67:35.33]You have to log into LeagueofLegends.com.
[67:37.95]You don't have to, like, swap DNA.
[67:42.48]Yes, congratulations.
[67:43.68]You deserve it.
[67:50.22]Raw Meatloaf seems to be very happy.
[67:56.64]We have 1,200.
[67:57.02]I wonder if the...
[68:03.32]Let me see something here.
[68:07.47]Same style, easy.
[68:11.11]Alright, so how do we get this?
[68:15.61]How do we get that unlock bad move?
[68:17.03]Do we have to move it to a certain slot or something?
[68:22.05]This takes will.
[68:25.35]Is there a way I can replace that with this move?
[68:35.64]Let's get intelligence trained.
[68:45.98]Alright, that doesn't look right.
[68:53.44]You really have to have the arm come out like that with a big bulb on it out of the center of his body.
[69:01.33]You couldn't have that come out of the top
[69:04.17]of his head or something.
[69:05.33]Or out of his mouth.
[69:13.25]No, he's just back to bed.
[69:19.82]Dirty mind streamer.
[69:22.24]Yeah, you get punished for that.
[69:23.10]That's the third time you've done that, asshole.
[69:24.70]No more of that, please.
[69:33.57]Level up intelligence.
[69:34.77]Do it right.
[69:37.25]Thank you.
[69:41.51]Well, 150 is a level up, right?
[69:49.68]Do it again.
[69:50.04]Fuck.
[69:53.68]Used to tired.
[69:56.16]Wait, what?
[69:56.88]I get called out?
[69:57.66]What do I do?
[69:59.90]Why am I getting called out?
[70:12.86]Maybe he'll cooperate now.
[70:15.40]Give him a bunch of food.
[70:16.64]Good food.
[70:17.14]High quality meats.
[70:19.16]Send him to bed.
[70:20.64]Get to work the next day.
[70:21.70]Let's level up.
[70:22.22]Come on.
[70:24.40]Not you.
[70:25.08]He's very well.
[70:28.46]He's well.
[70:30.54]Work.
[70:33.28]Level up intelligence.
[70:36.23]There we are.
[70:41.29]You called out a viewer.
[70:43.21]It is a good joke, good time.
[70:45.00]What did I do?
[70:45.48]Okay, he leveled up his intelligence.
[70:48.98]So now let's take a look at his data.
[70:54.18]Level 3 intelligence.
[70:56.44]Alright.
[71:03.68]What's my skill at?
[71:06.40]He needs more speed and more skill.
[71:10.44]He's called me out two times.
[71:13.45]That's the third time you've done that, asshole.
[71:15.73]Wait, I'm talking about this guy.
[71:17.84]Wait, what happened?
[71:21.47]Fuck you guys.
[71:22.15]I never said- No!
[71:23.75]I didn't just say- This is where we're gonna get weird.
[71:26.37]I didn't just say fuck you guys.
[71:28.07]I said fuck you guys in quotes because Fred Flintstone said it.
[71:30.69]By the way, Fred Flintstone, that's- Yeah.
[71:32.89]His name is fucking real funny.
[71:34.77]I'm not calling- Look, you guys are- I'm talking about the game.
[71:38.76]I didn't say fuck you guys.
[71:40.22]I said fuck you guys was in quotes that the guy was quoting me.
[71:43.40]You want me to do John McCain again?
[71:48.85]You want to do the Western Pennsylvania thing again?
[71:50.35]I don't think anybody wants that.
[71:54.31]Just play that video.
[71:55.15]Because that'll be like the eighth time I've made this reference.
[71:59.11]I'm not doing the John McCain reference again.
[72:05.16]I want 100 speed.
[72:14.08]One more, come on.
[72:14.82]I want 100 speed, come on.
[72:18.60]He seems tired.
[72:19.28]Put him to bed.
[72:23.71]Streamer fights his fans.
[72:27.91]I would lose.
[72:33.99]Why would I fight you guys?
[72:35.73]There are 2,500 people here.
[72:37.41]You think I'm just going to show up with boxing gloves?
[72:40.41]Alright.
[72:41.73]Let's do it.
[72:42.07]2,500 people versus one guy?
[72:47.05]All it takes is one person to throw a heavy object from the crowd and it's going to hit me in the face.
[72:53.13]No, not even that.
[72:54.33]You could get like, 10 of you could walk forward and have your hands out and 200 of you could be throwing rocks.
[73:01.23]And I'm going to be like, I'm dead.
[73:05.85]Why would you think I'm going to fight my fans?
[73:07.09]Are you serious?
[73:16.99]You guys could be throwing bricks.
[73:21.39]Somebody could like shit in a bag and like spin it around and throw it.
[73:23.99]I'm not dealing with that.
[73:25.19]I'm not dealing with somebody throwing shit bags at me.
[73:27.43]Not gonna happen.
[73:33.64]What happened?
[73:34.78]Raw meatloaf has been spoiled.
[73:36.08]Oh, great.
[73:43.06]He's trying to trick us.
[73:47.30]Streamer challenges 2,500 people to fight.
[73:49.34]Yeah, but here's the thing, alright, here's the only way I would do that.
[73:56.43]Is if I was in boxing gloves, and you guys all had to collectively yell, was your move that you were allowed to do.
[74:04.23]That would be fucking hard to deal with.
[74:06.46]You know, if all of you guys, all 2,500 of you, like, look, I got a pair of boxing gloves on, and I'm running at you, and you guys in unison go like...
[74:15.58]it'll make like a shockwave and I won't be able to come near you.
[74:17.73]That's the only thing you guys would be allowed to do.
[74:21.85]It would work.
[74:22.70]But I could still maybe, like, slowly run up there, and somebody- FUCKIN' IDIOT, I TOLD YOU NO ROCKS!
[74:29.26]There's like five trolls here, probably.
[74:31.30]Like, maybe there's probably like a hundred trolls here.
[74:33.62]A hundred of you would still throw a rock at me, even though you've signed the fucking NDA that clearly states you can only yell.
[74:40.47]One of you guys will have, like, a bottle of water and, like, whip it over at me, and that person will be escorted off the premises.
[74:52.35]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[74:53.33]I want speed.
[75:00.64]He thinks Twitch chat could collectively do something?
[75:05.98]Yeah.
[75:07.16]I do.
[75:13.85]The non-disclosure that states... Wait, wait, wait.
[75:15.97]We're not paying attention?
[75:16.87]Alright, what does it need?
[75:23.28]Defense could get to level 3.
[75:26.70]His skill is pretty bad, but... Let's level the defense up, just because we can.
[75:33.61]Just because it's there.
[75:34.45]Oh, he's sleeping on the job.
[75:37.09]Never mind.
[75:44.59]Twitch fights Jerma.
[75:47.34]Yes, punish him.
[75:47.94]He's spoiled.
[75:55.10]Yes, you should feel sorry.
[75:58.87]Defense.
[76:00.43]Is there a defense in life?
[76:02.93]No, I don't want to drop skill.
[76:03.97]There's intelligence as skill that drops defense.
[76:10.69]No, I don't want to do any of these.
[76:12.09]Just do the ones that assure things.
[76:13.27]I don't want to drop stats.
[76:20.59]That's all that has to happen.
[76:21.45]This guy has to just be the equivalent of plugged in.
[76:26.95]Official tournament.
[76:29.20]No, I'm not going to kill him.
[76:31.96]We want to get him to 150 defense.
[76:35.10]So one more time in the defense room.
[76:38.64]And then I think he'll be ready for the tournament.
[76:46.25]Strength doesn't mean anything when you're dead.
[76:54.24]That's true.
[76:54.92]2,500 person rock, paper, scissors.
[77:03.97]How would you, who would win?
[77:04.83]Is it me versus all you guys?
[77:08.12]So look, I'm gonna stand there, there's gonna be 2,500 people across the field.
[77:11.86]We're gonna go rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
[77:14.50]I'm gonna throw out scissors, and every single one of you is gonna do something else, and what am I gonna walk around and have you guys honestly hold out your hands?
[77:21.75]You're gonna just, you're gonna change it by the time I get over there.
[77:25.19]All you guys, like the 700 of you that put out paper,
[77:29.51]even though you're supposed to be like essentially red light green light out you're out you'll you I'm gonna be walking over you're gonna go like this you're gonna change the rock I'm like I can't trust you guys don't fall asleep good you're throwing rocks always throwing rocks you guys defense went up good
[78:02.35]2,400 person red light, green light.
[78:03.51]That would be actually really cool.
[78:06.65]Nah, never mind.
[78:07.65]That would get dangerous.
[78:09.43]Alright, I think I'm ready for a tournament.
[78:14.70]Let's get to 160 power.
[78:19.88]When's the next battle?
[78:22.68]Right here.
[78:23.02]Alright, let's do it.
[78:24.14]2,000 gold.
[78:25.49]I'm ready.
[78:26.25]Level 3.
[78:28.33]Participate.
[78:37.21]25 person... 25 person hopscotch.
[78:39.03]Well, that would be easy.
[78:40.95]Alright, did I get a laser move now?
[78:49.43]Raw meatloaf.
[78:50.05]Okay, Michael, here's where we're... This is the concerning part.
[78:53.76]Michael was scared of Splishio.
[78:57.34]But he's not scared of raw meatloaf.
[79:00.96]That's kind of concerning.
[79:10.80]Switch movesets?
[79:11.98]I might have to just select it and go up and down.
[79:14.56]So what was the button to push back again?
[79:16.10]It was square?
[79:16.58]When you get in close?
[79:24.40]Wow, this guy's actually pretty good.
[79:26.04]This guy's actually really good.
[79:28.37]It's just his health is not that great.
[79:29.67]Let's see what we can do here.
[79:33.99]There we go.
[79:34.61]Alright, let's try it.
[79:37.39]Wait till we get a better percentage and go for it.
[79:40.03]It takes 20 wills.
[79:40.73]It better be... Wow.
[79:43.53]Okay.
[79:48.39]That move is... It's very good.
[79:50.68]That's crazy.
[79:54.54]Two hits.
[79:54.98]He's dead.
[80:02.40]That's not a probe.
[80:04.54]That is a spike wall.
[80:05.58]That is multiple probes at the same time.
[80:11.13]I will take the free 2,000 gold.
[80:19.25]You hell-raised him.
[80:25.88]You can't beat the meat.
[80:27.10]No, you can't.
[80:30.28]Doesn't seem like it.
[80:33.72]Why are there only four monsters in D now?
[80:35.46]I don't know, that's a good question.
[80:40.58]Hmm.
[80:43.47]This guy's pretty much better all around, except for defense.
[80:46.71]Defense.
[80:49.87]It's alright, we're gonna Hellraiser him in a second anyways.
[80:53.73]He's burning all his will right off the bat.
[80:55.14]75 for 70, come on!
[80:57.34]Really?
[81:10.36]Oh, you dick.
[81:17.24]Come on.
[81:17.72]Give me a better shot than this.
[81:24.92]Come on.
[81:25.68]Give me a better shot than this.
[81:34.01]I gotta go for something here.
[81:35.07]We gotta just take a swing.
[81:39.23]Oh my god, he's been confused.
[81:47.01]Wait, wait, wait, we got it.
[81:52.29]I was just storing up will, I just couldn't get higher than like 45%.
[81:55.17]That move is really good though.
[82:09.39]Whirl.
[82:12.33]From what I remember in D, Whirl is pretty good.
[82:25.36]Clutch Meat.
[82:29.24]You know, if he goes 4-0, I kind of have to give him a little bit of praise, right?
[82:36.14]Let's do it.
[82:45.99]I like the high defense.
[82:47.57]It works out pretty well.
[82:50.19]Dammit.
[82:51.15]I went for it.
[82:51.67]Got him.
[82:54.97]Alright, now back it up.
[82:57.89]It's okay.
[83:10.19]Ah!
[83:10.55]I went for it.
[83:11.65]Now we can't mess around now.
[83:18.52]No, why do you have to be confused?
[83:19.91]That was a perfect opportunity.
[83:24.11]We're still gonna get it.
[83:24.71]I'm gonna just dodge a little bit here.
[83:31.41]Back away, back away, back away.
[83:37.87]And we're good.
[83:39.43]Victory.
[83:45.82]Flawless victory across the board.
[83:50.87]I like the high defense.
[83:51.69]It really works.
[83:53.35]In fact, I would have wanted more than offense.
[83:57.98]Raw meatloaf wins.
[84:00.74]$2,000.
[84:01.24]Can't beat the meat.
[84:05.62]No, no, no, no.
[84:06.38]That fucking spinner on.
[84:11.91]No, it's more than that.
[84:12.65]$2,300. $2,300.
[84:15.75]Can't wait to see the fame.
[84:17.45]That's it?
[84:18.55]I didn't lose one match.
[84:19.55]Why would I only get, like, nine fame?
[84:26.51]Just pump defense.
[84:27.97]I'm gonna pump defense and intelligence now.
[84:30.93]Or pump defense and power maybe at this point.
[84:32.73]No, defense and skill.
[84:33.61]He's very happy.
[84:40.48]And now he's very tired.
[84:43.98]Have a well-deserved rest.
[84:45.87]You made daddy two grand.
[84:54.95]Very well.
[84:55.79]Okay.
[84:57.43]3,500.
[84:59.29]This is where we train.
[85:01.57]And hopefully he doesn't fuck this whole thing up.
[85:07.28]Because I wanted skill... Do I want... I need skill.
[85:10.94]Bad.
[85:13.04]He's 110 skill.
[85:13.62]It's awful.
[85:14.92]It is embarrassing how bad that is.
[85:16.74]Let's do skill.
[85:22.00]Two grand.
[85:22.78]Don't mess it up.
[85:26.36]We need the percentages here.
[85:29.70]Don't fail all four of them.
[85:33.04]Thank God.
[85:35.46]He did the same thing last time.
[85:42.18]Four across the board.
[85:43.06]4-0.
[85:43.10]Come on.
[85:44.40]Yes.
[85:47.12]Even if they do it twice or three times, it's worth it.
[85:49.52]Because it's 12 points.
[85:52.73]Come on.
[85:53.35]Yes.
[85:54.69]Three out of four.
[85:59.81]Final week.
[86:01.17]Don't blow it.
[86:03.03]First time ever that I've ever seen it happen.
[86:05.45]Complete training.
[86:07.36]He deserved it.
[86:09.54]And he mastered a new technique.
[86:11.91]Praise him.
[86:15.85]He has a new move?
[86:18.47]What's his new move?
[86:21.41]Oh, shit.
[86:23.43]Sound Wave?
[86:30.72]Okay, so we got Probe Attack, Sound Wave, and Tackle.
[86:36.40]This is hit percentage A, this is also A.
[86:41.74]Yeah, we're going to be using this for the most part.
[86:45.16]So he just screams at you, alright.
[86:46.54]So the will is a little bit better than this one.
[86:48.52]Less damage, but... Cool.
[86:53.28]Oh shit, he learned Chat's attack move.
[86:56.44]The Chat move.
[87:01.96]Alright, let's go to item shop.
[87:06.51]Ah!
[87:07.43]Holly, how do you do?
[87:08.37]Hey!
[87:10.31]Long time no see.
[87:11.25]So who you been working for these days?
[87:15.17]This guy.
[87:15.87]Cool.
[87:16.23]I've never heard of this guy.
[87:17.31]Is he a streamer?
[87:19.88]I don't think I've ever seen him play PUBG before.
[87:23.70]I was hoping to work with a new breeder.
[87:25.02]Yeah, you were?
[87:25.78]Whoa.
[87:27.20]Yeah, see ya.
[87:27.78]Alright, bye.
[87:28.50]Why am I saying bye?
[87:34.40]What do you want?
[87:35.14]Okay, mango.
[87:36.27]The monster's tasty dessert found in the Hartville regions.
[87:42.03]A fattening treat for your monster.
[87:43.55]It's a specialty.
[87:47.90]Helps burn the fat.
[87:48.96]Taffy.
[87:51.32]Full of nutrition will heal fatigue.
[87:54.27]An item found in Salem that'll reduce stress and help your monster relax.
[87:59.17]Monsters hate this strong-smelling roasted snake.
[88:05.58]Prepared by a great chef.
[88:06.54]Manga.
[88:06.90]Alright, so I think these are just like little treats.
[88:09.94]You can use these when you combine monsters.
[88:17.18]Burn the fat.
[88:19.50]Candy.
[88:19.90]What about mint leaf?
[88:21.38]Reduce stress.
[88:24.58]Heal fatigue.
[88:26.50]The snake.
[88:29.18]I don't... That's $500.
[88:35.23]Snake, snake, snake, snake.
[88:36.87]Why do I want to feed him a snake?
[88:40.72]He's already spoiled.
[88:45.50]Why would I do that?
[88:48.92]Do it.
[88:51.22]Do it.
[88:51.77]My god.
[88:53.59]You guys need to relax.
[88:54.59]Do it.
[88:55.49]Do it.
[88:57.45]Feed it.
[88:57.81]Force him to eat it.
[88:58.79]Force it.
[88:59.19]Yes, force him to eat that.
[89:03.38]Like, pump the brakes a couple of pumps.
[89:07.44]Let's make him a fucking T. Teach him a lesson.
[89:16.63]I'm not gonna make him eat this.
[89:18.75]No, why would I be putting you, look, you can't beat the meat, alright?
[89:21.37]How am I gonna, how many more times do we have to say this?
[89:25.25]Let's give him some, let's give him some taffy.
[89:28.30]Let's get him some fresh water taffy.
[89:35.13]Look, we got the brick, a brick to eat.
[89:42.69]We're gonna feed him like a baby version of himself.
[89:51.02]Use.
[89:54.32]That's fucked up.
[89:55.49]I don't know if I like that.
[89:56.37]I'm not sure if I like that.
[90:03.91]Uh, no.
[90:06.18]Now this is creeping me out.
[90:07.34]No, let's go back.
[90:08.88]He doesn't need this.
[90:11.76]He isn't fatigued.
[90:12.52]What does he need to do?
[90:17.01]We can do skill again.
[90:19.85]Skill and power, I'd say.
[90:24.29]Speed and intelligence.
[90:25.75]Skill and intelligence.
[90:27.41]No, let's just do skill.
[90:29.83]We need to get that to level 3 eventually here.
[90:32.07]I'm gonna sneeze.
[90:37.98]I didn't even breathe in.
[90:39.56]I was trying to squelch it.
[90:41.54]Punish him, because yes, he's spoiled rotten.
[90:46.56]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[90:47.42]This time I have to breathe in so I can get it.
[90:53.71]Why am I doing that, man?
[90:54.99]I don't know.
[90:57.17]Something in the water.
[90:57.89]I'm telling you.
[91:00.11]Raw meat loves me to be tired.
[91:01.47]Yeah.
[91:07.53]Skill.
[91:12.73]Go to bed.
[91:17.65]Lame sneeze jokes.
[91:21.79]How is me sneezing a joke?
[91:25.29]Have we gotten that far down this rabbit hole?
[91:28.77]Wait, even if I have to sneeze, it's apparently me making a joke?
[91:33.68]Hold on, I have to sneeze.
[91:35.16]Chew!
[91:36.38]Oh, good joke, Jeremy!
[91:38.26]Come on, you can do better than that!
[91:39.54]What the fuck?
[91:44.52]What a joke.
[91:49.71]You see, the joke would be if I sneezed and shit my pants because of it.
[91:53.17]Now that would be funny.
[91:54.61]That would be a joke.
[91:56.59]What is he doing?
[91:59.21]He just turned into one of those platforms in Mario.
[92:08.00]When's the next fight?
[92:10.04]Not this week.
[92:10.58]We got a little bit more training to do.
[92:14.52]Skill.
[92:16.08]Get it right.
[92:17.85]Get it right.
[92:19.55]Hunt...
[92:21.68]Does that mean it worked apparently that means it worked Do it again you don't think that he's like skip now he tangled himself up in his own tongues No, no punishing
[92:48.74]How you doing, Meatloaf?
[92:49.50]Official tournament.
[92:52.45]He seems to be in shape.
[92:56.13]Let's take a look.
[92:57.75]Battle.
[92:58.27]I'm not so sure he's ready.
[93:03.75]I want him to have more than 135 health.
[93:06.63]Nah, we're skipping it.
[93:12.65]He needs to have... I want him to have at least... He needs to have 150 skill, like 140 health.
[93:19.29]He's not ready.
[93:26.82]Punish him.
[93:27.14]You don't want to be easy.
[93:29.66]Ban, you want me to punish him?
[93:31.24]Well, give him potatoes.
[93:32.36]There he is again.
[93:36.81]Oh, he's got the training.
[93:38.59]He's going to be 50% off.
[93:39.51]Perfect.
[93:40.97]Perfect.
[93:42.13]Look at this bee.
[93:42.83]Training fees this month only.
[93:44.29]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[93:46.59]I have enough, right?
[93:49.15]Uh, he needs to sleep, because he needs to- I want him to be ready for this.
[93:56.15]Do the same one skill.
[93:57.37]Hopefully he gets at least two or three out of four.
[94:03.04]Today is Raw Meatloaf's first birthday!
[94:05.90]Let's sing a song!
[94:07.84]Happy birthday to Raw Meatloaf!
[94:10.78]Get bigger.
[94:13.18]Is he going to grow in size?
[94:15.24]He seems very happy.
[94:18.53]He's very happy.
[94:19.47]He's doing a great job.
[94:23.85]Let's go make him have 150 skill.
[94:27.73]He did.
[94:30.41]Discount rates.
[94:31.05]Let's do skill.
[94:33.79]1,000 gold.
[94:34.29]Don't have this be a waste of money.
[94:36.13]Please.
[94:38.41]Do it.
[94:40.29]No!
[94:40.35]It's alright.
[94:46.69]Just don't do it again.
[94:47.47]Perfect.
[94:54.48]Just do that at least one more time.
[94:56.44]Nice.
[94:58.90]Okay, now it was officially worth doing.
[95:03.74]Skill went up.
[95:05.08]Congratulations.
[95:10.33]Yeah.
[95:14.33]Last one.
[95:20.25]Hey, what's that famous Meat Loaf song?
[95:23.15]Because two out of three ain't bad.
[95:26.17]Maybe two out of four.
[95:27.67]Because two out of... That was a joke and it didn't go... Is that Meat Loaf that does that?
[95:40.04]That's Meat Loaf, right?
[95:41.58]Yes, it is.
[95:42.06]That's Meat Loaf.
[95:54.07]Punisher.
[95:55.55]Borafravimos feels sorry.
[96:02.70]Alright.
[96:03.60]You're running out of cash.
[96:04.86]Work a computer.
[96:05.78]You go broke.
[96:06.28]Can you guys hear this?
[96:12.64]I can't hear it, but I want to see if you guys can.
[96:14.30]No, you can't.
[96:15.11]I was going to play the Meatloaf song, but... At this point, who cares?
[96:25.15]Rest.
[96:27.11]Do the official tournament.
[96:34.14]Punish Jerma, yes or no?
[96:35.50]Why are you punishing me?
[96:40.03]I'd say let's do life and either life and defense or life and power.
[96:49.62]Life and... Ah, this is life and defense.
[96:51.30]It's drop skill, though.
[96:52.34]What's my skill at?
[96:55.68]I don't want to downgrade skill.
[96:57.20]That's the one problem.
[96:58.02]If I could do both, let's just see what happens when I do this.
[97:02.46]How far down does it go?
[97:05.96]I'm not even going to know.
[97:14.13]He's tired.
[97:16.19]I didn't lose skill for that, right?
[97:18.50]Good.
[97:20.22]Rest up.
[97:27.56]Do skill.
[97:28.18]I just did skill.
[97:29.40]I just did a thousand dollars worth of skill.
[97:31.36]We just leveled up skill like seven times.
[97:42.68]He needs more life.
[97:44.24]He's desperate for health.
[97:53.40]I don't like... If you have that high defense, why would you not have more health?
[98:01.79]His loyalty is lower now?
[98:02.95]Yeah, because everyone yelled at me for spoiling him.
[98:04.93]This is his life.
[98:14.15]Hooray.
[98:16.57]Five up.
[98:19.16]Screw life, get defense.
[98:20.10]Well, you need to protect your life.
[98:23.44]You can have a million defense, but if your health pool is tiny, it doesn't even matter.
[98:26.69]You're negating yourself.
[98:29.29]I want 150 health.
[98:29.73]And that's finals.
[98:42.23]One more time.
[98:44.31]Or two more times.
[98:47.73]Do it again.
[98:51.96]He's still using this thing.
[98:53.06]I told you we were going to use this thing for like an hour.
[98:54.74]You thought I was making that up?
[98:58.02]Official tournament this week.
[99:03.59]If Raw Meatloaf gets KO'd, he's thinking he's going to die.
[99:06.87]Then he's not ready.
[99:10.97]Yeah, he's going up against the big boys here.
[99:12.51]I want him to be well rested, and I want him to be ready and loyal.
[99:25.94]No, no Taffy.
[99:26.72]No, I need to have him in a position that I want him to be in.
[99:29.96]I almost just made him sleep again.
[99:37.18]Alright, one more life, and then we're gonna do the defense and... Yeah.
[99:41.82]Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
[99:46.50]We're doing defense and... Where is it?
[99:48.84]Life and defense.
[99:49.50]I'm gonna lose skill here, but it should be fine.
[99:53.72]Get it right or pay the price.
[99:55.50]I told him he was gonna pay the price.
[100:04.41]I was gonna wave my finger at him.
[100:10.92]Please do that again.
[100:12.20]And this time get it right.
[100:19.12]How much do you lose?
[100:20.14]Life up eight.
[100:21.00]Alright, lost four skill.
[100:23.29]We need to do skill again.
[100:24.23]Yeah, his skill went down.
[100:29.13]I know.
[100:30.35]Punish him?
[100:35.25]Ah, his skill went down.
[100:36.87]Punish him.
[100:39.43]That was a lot of health though, so I'm happy where the health is.
[100:41.30]And the defense is okay then, too.
[100:44.22]Yes, if you're just joining us, we combined the worm with the... D-Sponge for the wall.
[100:56.01]But, is Jerm of Mars this wall?
[101:01.37]Why's everybody doing that?
[101:04.33]I mean, it kinda is this.
[101:05.59]I can see that.
[101:07.76]It makes sense.
[101:15.45]Next tournament we're going to participate in.
[101:16.79]Let's see when it is.
[101:23.00]I need to change that emote to Jerma Wall.
[101:27.34]That's not even Mars.
[101:28.30]It never was Mars.
[101:31.76]That just looks like somebody threw dirt on my face.
[101:38.71]Alright, tournament time.
[101:42.89]He's under too much stress.
[101:44.01]Ugh.
[101:48.00]Do you like candy?
[101:48.58]Should I give him some candy?
[101:49.42]Alright, here's the official tournament here.
[101:52.06]Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[101:56.50]We get an extra prize, a CD fragment, if we win this.
[102:01.26]Oh boy, he's going to be ready.
[102:02.74]Okay, what do I need?
[102:04.94]Let's do one more into power.
[102:08.28]Power.
[102:09.58]Sleep.
[102:12.08]Tournament.
[102:15.93]Come on, don't fail it, don't fail, don't fail!
[102:17.55]Yes!
[102:19.54]That gives us more than 160 power.
[102:24.68]Sleep, rest up for the tournament, and then we're gonna try to win that CD fragment.
[102:36.34]He's very, very well.
[102:38.20]There it is.
[102:40.46]Four monsters, it's a level D, you get a CD fragment if you win.
[102:47.27]I'm ready.
[102:48.95]Give him the mint?
[102:51.15]Wait, why give him the mint?
[102:57.05]Tell him you love him.
[103:03.52]Oh, I'm gonna kick.
[103:04.12]Look at all these guys.
[103:04.64]They're gonna kick all their asses.
[103:06.74]Nobody on this list is scary except for Gurren.
[103:10.22]And even he sucks.
[103:11.06]Alright, we're gonna try Twitch chat's special move.
[103:18.95]See how it works.
[103:27.64]He seems to have gotten bigger.
[103:30.38]So have I, though.
[103:34.16]Oh, look at this.
[103:34.90]You had no contest.
[103:37.20]I told you I wanted to be ready.
[103:39.00]Alright, here comes the Twitch chat scream.
[103:40.67]Let's see how it works.
[103:41.45]Alright, you missed.
[103:51.84]Pretty good.
[103:55.14]See, that's what you guys are going to be doing to me!
[103:57.66]Why am I still just doing this move?
[103:59.21]I just used all my will, because I'm an idiot.
[104:02.37]Oh, it's like a dumb joke.
[104:09.59]Alright, we're going to do the Spike Squall here.
[104:16.20]Hopefully kill him.
[104:17.58]Yeah, he's dumb.
[104:19.44]He's toast.
[104:24.61]Get in that CD fragment, man.
[104:26.37]I'm telling you.
[104:35.08]You guys are doing the jermaMars with the thing.
[104:38.78]Hey, Michael has forfeited.
[104:41.62]Get out of here.
[104:42.40]Now you're scared.
[104:44.58]Bring him on.
[104:45.32]Gotta win this.
[104:45.86]Gotta beat Gurren.
[104:50.14]This is where we have to make it work.
[104:59.66]That's so stupid.
[105:01.38]I love it.
[105:03.64]Alright.
[105:04.38]Come on.
[105:04.66]I think I'm going to outclass him here.
[105:12.56]Although the speed thing might be a problem.
[105:16.76]I mean, it's still... I can't fuck around.
[105:19.87]Just don't mess around here.
[105:20.67]71% he loses it.
[105:34.76]Back it up.
[105:36.24]God damn it, really?
[105:49.58]Back up.
[106:00.68]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[106:01.86]Back up!
[106:04.65]Back it up.
[106:08.81]Shit!
[106:09.32]Come on!
[106:11.44]Oh!
[106:14.38]Yes!
[106:15.82]The CD fragment is gonna die!
[106:19.94]Yes!
[106:26.00]Well, that sounded like I was just going out of a window.
[106:36.82]Fusion item.
[106:38.04]Fusion item!
[106:41.52]You killed him for the breaking a CD in half and taking it.
[106:48.62]And $2,300.
[106:51.16]And more fame.
[106:53.06]Ooh, back up to 35.
[106:54.28]That's pretty good, I like it.
[107:02.53]Burn another CD and then fuse them.
[107:06.47]I'm not burning another CD.
[107:08.58]I'm sorry.
[107:09.28]That's never gonna happen.
[107:13.80]I fucking bricked my computer the last time we did that.
[107:17.44]Somebody was saying it'd be funny if I burnt the VOD from last time and then used that.
[107:26.47]Training is half off.
[107:29.34]I wonder what I want to do here.
[107:31.32]What could this be?
[107:32.44]All items are on sale.
[107:34.17]Okay.
[107:35.57]Check that out in a second here.
[107:38.09]Save the game, first of all, because, I mean, like, yikes.
[107:41.01]That would be bad.
[107:47.59]Burn the VOD.
[107:49.23]Break a city in half and then put it in.
[107:53.19]That's not going to work.
[107:56.95]I'll buy a couple of snakes.
[108:02.39]I can't burn the Vaude.
[108:03.77]That's like four hours.
[108:06.83]Do you understand how long it would take to burn a four hour- We're not talking about a DVD.
[108:11.64]We're talking about a CD, by the way.
[108:14.70]Four hours of video needs to be compressed down to under 800 megabytes.
[108:18.60]A CD is like 768 megabytes.
[108:24.87]Four hours of video is like five gigs.
[108:28.93]I would have to compress that file, which would take like 40 minutes, and then put that on, and then burn a fucking full CD.
[108:37.41]That would take like 45- that would take two and a half hours to do that.
[108:41.97]I'm not- it's not gonna happen.
[108:48.01]Give him some minutes.
[108:48.83]Alright, let's go to the item shop.
[108:53.81]Burn the clip of you talking about burning a CD.
[109:00.20]We did the burn the CD joke last night and it turned my computer off.
[109:04.34]We're not doing that again.
[109:05.14]Wow, these things are cheap.
[109:09.52]Alright, mint leaf.
[109:12.55]Let's get like... Let's get like three of these.
[109:20.04]Yeah, let's buy a couple of... Let's buy a snake.
[109:22.54]Because everybody wants me to buy a snake.
[109:24.94]But how is this half off?
[109:31.94]Let's get some... Apple cake.
[109:37.42]Mango.
[109:39.15]Might as well get a couple more pieces.
[109:40.27]No, let's get one more piece of taffy.
[109:44.03]I feel like this is steam, man.
[109:46.35]Like, just because it's on sale doesn't mean you have to buy it.
[109:51.46]Do I really need the fear collection?
[109:54.34]When am I ever gonna play that?
[110:00.17]Do I have to own a Call of Duty that came out six years ago?
[110:04.03]Why?
[110:04.63]No, I don't want that.
[110:06.45]Buy like five mangos.
[110:09.85]I can only buy one, apparently.
[110:12.23]I think my item box is full.
[110:18.69]No, that's it.
[110:19.17]Why not spend any more money?
[110:23.17]I have to pee again.
[110:24.27]This is so stupid.
[110:25.49]How many hours?
[110:26.17]It's been like two... I've had to pee every 50 minutes.
[110:29.19]Because I drank a full Gatorade.
[110:34.99]You know what I'm saying?
[110:35.77]I don't do this.
[110:37.35]I drank a full Gatorade in like an hour and 10 minutes.
[110:45.63]It's just here.
[110:46.76]If I have liquid in front of me, I drink it.
[110:48.16]It doesn't matter what it is.
[110:48.88]How many ounces is this?
[110:52.01]80 oz- No, 80 Calvary's.
[110:55.49]This is 30 oz of liquid.
[110:57.28]In like an hour.
[110:58.80]God.
[110:59.82]I'll be back.
[113:33.40]Okay.
[113:33.58]Let's go ahead and come back.
[113:40.61]Play some more Monster Rancher.
[113:42.45]God damn it!
[113:49.47]Another fucking Gatorade!
[113:53.96]Why?
[113:54.28]What am I doing?
[114:07.16]I don't even drink another fucking full Gatorade.
[114:09.96]Why?
[114:10.34]What if I have bug?
[114:12.42]Am I just attracted to fucking sweet sugary fluids?
[114:18.56]I didn't even want to bring this down here.
[114:20.26]I just did it out of habit.
[114:27.87]What's he doing?
[114:35.70]I don't even know what I want to do here.
[114:42.91]Maybe... Intelligence and power?
[114:47.39]He needs a speed.
[114:48.17]It's so bad.
[114:49.15]I can't have... I can't have that.
[114:52.45]I'm gonna go pay for speed.
[115:01.94]Discount's over, but I...
[115:04.94]Do they even have a speed version of this?
[115:06.26]No, they don't.
[115:11.21]More intelligence, maybe?
[115:12.09]I feel like he can't be that well-rounded.
[115:19.09]Having 150 in every single thing is just not gonna happen.
[115:22.87]I gotta pick something and stick with it.
[115:25.55]Do we want him to be more... Should he have more Twitch chat moves, or should he be powerful?
[115:32.92]Let's do intelligence.
[115:33.70]Let's make him, like, really just stupidly smart.
[115:36.02]Because everyone knows how Twitch chat is fucking so smart, right?
[115:42.08]That was... I said that really condescendingly.
[115:45.08]And that was... I didn't mean it like that.
[115:47.33]I did, though, but, like, that... I don't really mean that, you know?
[115:50.99]That's what I mean.
[115:56.15]Smart loaf.
[115:57.37]Let's do it.
[115:57.81]2,000 bucks.
[115:58.55]Go for it.
[116:03.77]150 IQ chat.
[116:06.81]See how smart you get when you swim?
[116:18.20]What?
[116:18.58]Oh.
[116:19.14]Hey, it's March.
[116:20.36]It's March in real life.
[116:23.81]That's so weird.
[116:24.51]Did it again?
[116:26.23]Good.
[116:30.58]This is eight every time.
[116:31.82]That's awesome.
[116:33.06]The skill one is six.
[116:36.22]He's breezing through this.
[116:37.18]This is amazing.
[116:39.44]Twitch chat is so fucking smart.
[116:40.88]Look at this.
[116:47.41]Four out of four.
[116:49.27]He's at 184.
[116:51.21]He mastered a new technique.
[116:54.35]You guys learned a new... Why am I calling this you guys?
[116:56.47]This is not you guys.
[116:57.35]This is not Twitch chat.
[116:58.29]Why am I doing this?
[117:04.88]You guys have become this character somehow.
[117:11.48]What?
[117:13.35]You're too hard?
[117:13.97]He's gonna pass out.
[117:14.69]What do you mean he's gonna pass out?
[117:15.71]Go to sleep.
[117:23.83]How dare you call me raw meatloaf.
[117:27.51]It's the scream thing.
[117:33.56]He's still tired, damn.
[117:37.26]What did he learn?
[117:39.55]Scratch.
[117:43.61]That takes a lot of will.
[117:46.85]Okay.
[117:49.65]So the damage on this is the same, but this one actually saps will from the person you're attacking.
[117:54.30]I thought all of them do, except for the regular moves.
[118:03.77]This one's just a better version of this, but it hits less frequently.
[118:07.13]I'm probably going to keep this one on permanently.
[118:11.41]Mint, mint, mint, mint, mint.
[118:15.63]Mint, mint, mint.
[118:18.51]Why is everybody freaking out and saying mint, mint, mint, mint?
[118:22.92]Alright.
[118:24.48]Here, take some, give him some mint.
[118:28.28]Take it.
[118:34.01]That was terrifying.
[118:38.16]Mint, mint, mint.
[118:40.16]He's fine.
[118:40.72]Everybody calm down.
[118:47.52]200 intelligence?
[118:48.05]What do you think?
[118:48.77]I think so.
[118:52.65]What's the battle schedule look like here?
[118:56.69]Now let's rest up.
[118:57.41]Let's rest up and enter the battle.
[119:09.08]He's very well.
[119:11.32]Battle D. When's the C cup coming up next time?
[119:15.22]These are for CD fragments as well.
[119:18.81]This is for 2,000 bucks.
[119:20.39]Sure, let's do it.
[119:26.47]200 brick IQ.
[119:30.46]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[119:40.16]Uh, he has decided he's gonna- he's withdrawing.
[119:42.80]He gave up.
[119:46.86]Uh, Michael has decided that he's going to give up as well.
[119:50.21]That's two free victories, cool.
[119:53.91]So, Wuro is the only one that wants to fight us.
[119:56.29]If I win this, I win the tournament.
[120:01.02]It's like in Little League when, you know, you have the kids that are, you know, you can be only 12 years old.
[120:08.17]It's like 10 to 12 years old for Little League.
[120:10.99]And then there's like the 14-year-old that somehow snuck in there, somehow with forged papers.
[120:17.27]And he hits a home run every time.
[120:21.28]I think that's how this is gonna work here.
[120:31.99]Yeah, forge papers.
[120:38.00]Whirl wants revenge the way you screamed him to death last time.
[120:41.06]He's not gonna get it.
[120:41.76]Because we've improved tenfold since then.
[120:45.08]So is he.
[120:45.78]But not as many folds as we have.
[120:52.43]Let's do scratches and screams.
[120:55.61]Hey, Twitch chat in a nutshell.
[120:57.69]Scratches and screams.
[121:05.11]Again, let's get... I want to do the Scratch.
[121:07.08]Take some of his will.
[121:10.20]Sap the life from him, you know what I'm saying?
[121:14.74]I guess we're just gonna do that.
[121:23.23]I'm gonna try the new move.
[121:26.39]That move is fucking stupid.
[121:29.47]I'm gonna lose this because I'm just trying new moves.
[121:39.59]There we go.
[121:40.21]Now we don't lose.
[121:40.93]Gonna be close, though, somehow.
[121:44.08]Okay, now I have to actually hit him with something now.
[121:49.12]Oh, fuck.
[121:49.68]This is gonna be... This is gonna be close.
[121:51.26]This is gonna be real close.
[121:52.08]Right at the last second.
[121:56.03]Bingo.
[121:56.59]Clutch.
[121:58.05]Nice job.
[122:00.19]That would've been real close.
[122:04.75]That may have actually been after the buzzer.
[122:07.27]But I didn't get any penalties on that one.
[122:14.29]That was definitely after the buzzer.
[122:16.65]Without a doubt.
[122:25.20]That's $2,300 for free.
[122:29.24]Gained a few audience members too.
[122:31.24]That's good.
[122:38.58]I'm not sure he's ready for C. I can still participate in C, even if I lose.
[122:48.25]He's very happy.
[122:50.73]He seems well as... Well, that's good.
[122:53.81]Style, easy.
[122:54.19]We've got to change that.
[122:57.43]Speed, maybe some defense in life.
[123:01.69]Yeah, defense in life.
[123:04.15]Speed, defense in life, I would say the number one...
[123:10.00]Let's do... speed.
[123:15.96]Hooray.
[123:23.39]Not speed?
[123:23.99]Why not?
[123:24.81]Even if I get him over a hundred?
[123:27.15]More intelligence.
[123:34.12]Don't fall asleep?
[123:35.28]Yes.
[123:43.70]Defense and intelligence.
[123:47.11]I have a lot of money.
[123:47.75]No, I'm not going to.
[123:49.47]He's too spoiled.
[123:50.81]When's the next?
[123:55.83]Let's go battle.
[123:57.07]Am I not ready for C yet?
[123:58.31]Is that the problem here?
[124:02.11]There is a CD fragment in this one.
[124:03.86]Okay, I'm going to do this one.
[124:04.84]We're going to get the CD fragments.
[124:05.98]We're going to do some magic.
[124:08.38]We're going to do some more CDs.
[124:09.16]We're going to pull some more out.
[124:23.12]He's well.
[124:27.40]Power and life, you know.
[124:30.18]Life and defense, but I don't want to drop down a full level in skill.
[124:33.69]Let's just keep doing it like this.
[124:37.99]Give him the CD fragment?
[124:40.13]It's not gonna do anything.
[124:41.67]Yeah, that's only for fusions.
[124:51.03]Should we just train intelligence again?
[124:59.70]You know, I'm gonna get this out of the way.
[125:02.65]Yep.
[125:04.01]I'm getting this.
[125:04.51]I already paid for it, so nobody can even yell at me.
[125:07.97]We're never doing this ever again.
[125:09.15]We're never doing life ever again.
[125:15.29]I'm gonna get to like 200 health.
[125:20.21]He's not gonna mess it up one time.
[125:24.93]Mint.
[125:25.51]Mint.
[125:25.77]Give us mint.
[125:27.63]He's doing fine.
[125:32.58]You guys didn't even need to have the mint.
[125:34.76]You're at 3 out of 4.
[125:38.84]This was very necessary.
[125:40.00]Remember, it's not about winning with KOs.
[125:45.04]You just need to win, and he 4-0'd it.
[125:46.58]Almost 200 health.
[125:47.80]What do you mean he wasn't successful?
[125:54.83]How is that not successful?
[126:00.22]You're too hard on him.
[126:01.08]Now I'm firm.
[126:02.00]I was just... Okay, it's easier.
[126:03.48]Firm, easy, firm.
[126:04.40]What the hell?
[126:07.05]Here, have some mint.
[126:16.15]Eat some mint, guys.
[126:18.68]Why'd I punish him?
[126:19.36]Because it said I was too easy on him.
[126:26.61]Don't bet.
[126:30.90]Successful means he learns a move.
[126:32.70]Okay, I get it.
[126:36.60]Here comes the tournament.
[126:39.76]Seems a bit vulnerable.
[126:40.78]I don't know.
[126:43.46]Really?
[126:43.74]We're not going to do it then.
[126:58.12]Just rest again.
[127:00.64]Get fully prepared.
[127:04.32]He's gonna die.
[127:05.28]He's not gonna die.
[127:07.85]I'm not gonna make it possible for him to die.
[127:15.53]He's getting a steak.
[127:17.65]Am I still firm?
[127:20.11]Am I still firm on him now?
[127:24.40]Just because I gave him a steak means I'm not firm anymore.
[127:28.78]Where are we at?
[127:31.95]197.
[127:31.97]Let's get to 200 health.
[127:34.17]And then let's dump into intelligence and defense.
[127:38.71]Sounds like a plan.
[127:45.52]He's going to be a logger.
[127:49.64]There he is. 202.
[128:00.42]When's the next battle?
[128:06.31]Right now.
[128:06.69]Let's do it.
[128:07.39]Let's make more money.
[128:08.61]Come on.
[128:12.51]Then we can train intelligence again.
[128:17.31]Mint.
[128:17.77]Mint.
[128:18.28]No, he's not getting any more mints.
[128:21.50]He's fine.
[128:22.16]I'm not gonna get KO'd by any of these guys.
[128:25.20]Half of them are gonna run away from the fight anyways.
[128:28.32]See?
[128:29.56]Michael forfeited.
[128:33.97]Mepeto is apparently ready to fight.
[128:36.77]Good.
[128:44.83]I'm only in it for the money?
[128:47.39]In Monster... I just called this game Monster Breeder.
[128:54.18]It's the same damn thing.
[129:00.52]His power is really high, but his health is terrible.
[129:04.25]This would be a no contest.
[129:08.33]I'm going for the Scratch immediately.
[129:09.69]It's alright.
[129:12.69]Easy, easy, easy.
[129:13.73]Back it up.
[129:14.65]We have to get a successful Scratch.
[129:26.02]What's with my hit percentage here, man?
[129:33.63]That's all it took.
[129:43.17]Dancing around.
[129:50.85]Now we're safe.
[129:53.13]My defense is way too high.
[129:54.15]He's not going to hurt me.
[129:59.86]Now I just have to survive.
[130:01.14]Actually, I might be able to get one more off.
[130:05.24]Oh, yeah, I got 11 here.
[130:06.26]Let's just crush them.
[130:08.07]Oh, 1 HP, really.
[130:09.01]It's not like it matters.
[130:10.79]You don't get any more points.
[130:16.53]Dogs can't eat meatloafs, you fool.
[130:26.52]This game looks sick as heck, to be honest, in five minutes.
[130:28.78]I don't know why they haven't made another one.
[130:32.62]This is a really cool concept.
[130:33.94]It's not Pokémon, right?
[130:36.70]This is Pokémon, but not going out in the wilderness and looking for monsters.
[130:41.53]It's kind of just breeding from a CD and fighting.
[130:47.15]It's a really, really gimmicky, kind of a messy gimmick where you need to pull out a hundred CDs to make a monster that you want to use.
[130:56.25]But it's cool.
[130:57.14]It's a little...
[130:58.91]It's interesting enough, right?
[131:00.49]Back like 20 years ago, this was such a huge deal.
[131:02.69]I remember I was so high on life playing this game when I was like 15, 14.
[131:10.60]I didn't even understand how to play.
[131:11.74]I didn't even play the game.
[131:13.68]I swear to God, I didn't play this part.
[131:15.30]I just wanted to put CDs in.
[131:17.82]That's all I cared about.
[131:24.67]He can't handle the scream.
[131:26.71]It's at 63% pretty much permanently.
[131:28.21]Fuck you.
[131:35.46]Double scream.
[131:37.06]No, never mind.
[131:41.18]Back it up.
[131:41.58]Back it up.
[131:42.10]Back it up.
[131:42.76]Come on.
[131:43.92]Back it up.
[131:47.46]Wow, he won't back it up.
[131:48.78]He won't back off.
[131:55.65]It's alright.
[131:55.91]We're still going to get it.
[132:03.62]Defense is high enough where it's not going to matter.
[132:07.68]There we go.
[132:08.16]Finally.
[132:15.21]Just only do the scream.
[132:16.29]He can't handle it.
[132:23.12]Such a higher percentage to do than the other move.
[132:26.87]I have not seen the claw land once.
[132:30.79]Just has such terrible percentage.
[132:32.09]There we go.
[132:37.54]There's 2,000.
[132:41.02]Happy with that.
[132:49.10]Prize money, and then... 44.
[132:51.50]That's as famous as we've ever been.
[132:57.86]I'm running the most popular Monster Rancher stream right now.
[133:01.44]Let me correct you there.
[133:02.88]I'm running the only Monster Rancher stream right now.
[133:09.22]Or am I?
[133:09.60]I don't know.
[133:09.92]Is anybody else playing this?
[133:11.42]Why would they?
[133:12.58]On like the PlayStation 1?
[133:18.95]Now I'm going to make him train intelligence.
[133:20.33]How old is he?
[133:21.07]Is he going to die soon?
[133:23.63]Should we suck out his DNA and mix him with somebody?
[133:29.38]How old is he?
[133:34.56]He's one years old, right?
[133:38.04]Okay, are monsters in this game like hamsters?
[133:41.04]Is he dead at two or three years old?
[133:45.72]Or what?
[133:48.08]That move sucks.
[133:57.68]It's probably like three to five years, I'd say.
[134:02.75]Let me save it.
[134:04.19]I haven't saved it in a while.
[134:05.03]Depending on stress, I can live from three to five years.
[134:16.03]Okay, that's cool.
[134:17.23]We've got a while.
[134:21.04]Training.
[134:24.14]Intelligence.
[134:31.40]Breeze through it.
[134:36.82]Mint.
[134:38.28]It doesn't need a bit.
[134:41.40]Breeze past 200 intelligence.
[134:45.25]Learn a new move.
[134:49.51]No failures, no failures, no failures.
[134:51.09]Yes.
[134:57.21]Intelligence went up.
[135:00.47]Any new move?
[135:05.05]Yeah, he actually does have 200 IQ.
[135:06.93]Why is that making me laugh?
[135:22.79]Fuck, this is like the third or fourth time he has got a 404.
[135:25.75]No, don't punish him.
[135:33.70]200 IQ, Loaf.
[135:38.29]Oh, that's so dumb.
[135:41.03]That is dumb.
[135:42.19]Why would we be increasing intelligence if he has power moves?
[135:52.12]Well, the scream is intelligence.
[135:54.94]And the theory is... If I keep doing intelligence, he'll get more int moves.
[136:02.38]And what, everything's gonna be on sale right after I do the training?
[136:06.42]Thanks.
[136:08.36]Training fees reduced this month only.
[136:09.89]Okay, this month only.
[136:11.03]We can do it again.
[136:15.57]Uh, how much money do I have?
[136:16.63]670?
[136:16.65]For this month.
[136:18.81]So let's see.
[136:19.21]Okay, if you look at his moveset, this is an intelligence move.
[136:26.96]So he has all power moves except for this one.
[136:30.29]Which, if you notice, when we fought the dinosaur, the dinosaur couldn't really deflect this.
[136:36.33]It had a much higher hit percentage than even this move.
[136:40.69]And it does more damage.
[136:41.71]They don't have as much resistance or damage absorption.
[136:46.45]We're going all in on intelligence.
[136:47.71]Because I want to get the other move that's probably over here.
[136:49.16]It's probably like a laser beam.
[136:51.26]And our power's not terrible where we can go up.
[136:54.86]This music is killing me.
[136:57.02]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[137:00.37]Sorry, I'm sorry.
[137:01.91]Alright, let's look at what we got here.
[137:06.51]Week one, week two, week three.
[137:08.04]We're on the first week.
[137:09.66]Six.
[137:11.28]Seventy, seven seventy, eight seventy, nine seventy.
[137:15.42]No, we're not gonna be able to afford it.
[137:16.60]We have to do one of these.
[137:20.60]We have to do these ones.
[137:22.10]So we're going to do power, we need defense and life.
[137:25.73]Forget about skill for, we need the money.
[137:28.13]I'll train, I'll be there.
[137:29.43]I'll meet you halfway, right?
[137:31.53]We'll do intelligence, we'll do life and defense.
[137:34.79]And then we're going to do skill for our training.
[137:38.25]Because this is the only way we're going to be able to make as much money to be able to do this.
[137:42.53]300, 400, yeah.
[137:44.15]So he just has to be successful every time.
[137:51.33]Okay.
[137:56.77]Don't fail it.
[137:58.77]It's alright.
[137:59.37]We're gonna try and skill anyways.
[138:01.79]Put on different music.
[138:02.72]You want me to just play like a fucking royalty-free playlist instead?
[138:08.56]What is this now?
[138:10.52]The shop.
[138:14.39]The item shop is on sale.
[138:15.75]Why is everything on sale?
[138:18.26]Seems tired.
[138:19.80]This is where we eat the taffy.
[138:25.28]Heal fatigue, right?
[138:26.06]So then we don't have to sleep at all.
[138:29.42]Put it to anything?
[138:30.41]Oh my god.
[138:31.93]I can't even play a royalty-free playlist.
[138:37.41]I can't.
[138:38.07]My, like, sound is off on my computer.
[138:41.29]I can't.
[138:43.17]Please play anything.
[138:45.33]Taffy.
[138:51.30]Sorry, I get this I cannot pump sound through my sound is taken over by that all the devices I have to make the PlayStation 1 work Eat the taffy I don't think I can even turn it off Not anything else Every time I'll turn it down when we come back to like the obnoxious horn.
[139:20.34]Oh
[139:23.32]Alright, don't fail it again.
[139:27.56]Same deal, we're gonna do life and defense.
[139:31.05]Don't fail it.
[139:33.73]Come on.
[139:36.77]Yes!
[139:39.39]Alright, one more time.
[139:44.97]He seems well.
[139:45.77]970.
[139:46.16]What do we got?
[139:51.12]We got today...
[139:55.18]Okay, I just have to do an easy one.
[139:59.78]What's one that he's pretty much guaranteed to do?
[140:01.30]Defense, maybe?
[140:04.50]Okay, last one.
[140:05.34]He has to get it.
[140:09.89]Do it!
[140:13.37]Yes!
[140:14.61]Ha ha!
[140:17.37]We can train for a thousand dollars.
[140:22.73]There's a tournament this week.
[140:23.65]He's not ready.
[140:24.95]He's weak.
[140:26.59]He seems tired.
[140:27.33]I got the cure for that.
[140:31.13]Eat another taffy and then go train.
[140:37.58]We're gaming the system here big time.
[140:43.58]I'm going to use a mint too.
[140:45.06]Mint him up so he's ready.
[140:47.94]Let's mint him up.
[140:53.55]So we can be completely prepared for training.
[140:59.23]No.
[140:59.43]No more snakes.
[141:02.30]Training.
[141:02.92]And we're going to train skill.
[141:13.36]What do you think?
[141:13.84]Skill?
[141:14.40]Or should we just go dump all into intelligence?
[141:17.54]I feel like skill has to... This is percentage.
[141:19.49]We're doing skill.
[141:20.15]We have to.
[141:22.71]I don't want to miss.
[141:23.62]It's annoying to miss everything.
[141:29.40]We won't have to do this again for a while.
[141:39.83]Skill.
[141:40.31]Big skill.
[141:40.97]Skill.
[141:41.31]Put all the money in mints.
[141:49.20]Nice.
[141:49.50]Good.
[141:56.35]Can we buy any more menu music?
[141:58.17]I don't know.
[142:02.69]Buy mute music from the vendor.
[142:10.06]Four out of four again.
[142:12.24]He started off so terrible.
[142:17.22]Don't punish him.
[142:17.80]There's no reason to.
[142:20.73]You want me to turn it up?
[142:25.62]Alright.
[142:27.12]You're running out of cash, work, or computer.
[142:28.86]You're gonna go broke.
[142:31.12]Oh shit, I only have $70.
[142:36.16]When's the battle?
[142:38.64]The next official battle is early next week, and it's a CD fragment.
[142:43.32]Alright, when is the actual move-on cup?
[142:47.55]Official cup is right here.
[142:52.45]Winter D cup.
[142:53.73]Okay, we got a little while.
[142:56.35]Just rest.
[143:03.13]You're gonna hear the theme.
[143:03.97]This is what I told you guys.
[143:04.79]I heard this in my sleep.
[143:07.13]And as I was doing basic tasks.
[143:13.40]Holy shit, I thought I just lost the game.
[143:14.60]I just almost freaked out right there.
[143:15.74]Okay, potatoes.
[143:16.42]What do we need?
[143:22.09]Intelligence... Maybe defense and... defense and intelligence is where I'm gonna focus now.
[143:27.71]Let's do defense.
[143:34.79]Still awake.
[143:36.31]Good job.
[143:40.76]At least we have enough money to buy something.
[143:45.42]Again.
[143:51.58]I don't think he's failed a job or training in like an hour.
[144:02.23]We need money.
[144:03.17]Battle.
[144:03.49]We're going to do the next one here.
[144:06.39]So he's going to sleep, work, battle.
[144:11.44]We need money.
[144:18.55]So after three to five years, we're going to eat him.
[144:20.23]No, we're going to combine him with somebody else.
[144:21.73]We need to have a good candidate, though.
[144:26.66]How old is he?
[144:27.60]He's two years and one month.
[144:28.92]He's going to die in like nine months.
[144:34.86]We better combine him before then.
[144:42.60]What do we have?
[144:43.46]What do we have?
[144:43.84]Time.
[144:44.17]Battle.
[144:46.83]We can do defense one more time.
[144:52.64]Please explain the game.
[144:53.58]I'm so confused.
[144:54.30]Alright, I'm going to do my best to explain what's going on here.
[144:56.34]So, Monster Rancher is a game where you have a monster.
[145:02.39]You breed a monster from a disk.
[145:05.43]So the game says, hey, come to the shrine.
[145:08.37]Please put in any disk you have in your whole entire house.
[145:12.58]Has to be a CD for the PlayStation 1.
[145:14.26]Can't read DVDs.
[145:15.00]I just learned that the hard way three days ago.
[145:18.01]So from the data on a CD, it pulls a random seed.
[145:24.91]Think of like a Minecraft seed.
[145:26.33]It pulls a random seed off of the data on the disk and makes a random monster from that disk.
[145:33.04]Then you train them and you fight them and then they die.
[145:37.10]Or that you combine them into other monsters that you came off of the other CDs.
[145:42.95]Pretty good.
[145:43.25]Alright, let's get some money.
[145:49.86]Everyone's going to be scared of us anyways.
[145:51.03]You're going to have plenty of warning when he's getting old.
[145:57.85]You can relax.
[145:58.67]I'm just kidding.
[146:04.92]Retire the meatloaf after this battle and then work on training a mate for him.
[146:14.20]Yeah.
[146:14.89]Give us the free money.
[146:17.53]Sorry, Mepeto is going to go down.
[146:21.69]The lower their intelligence, the more that I have to use intelligence moves, because that's how you get intelligence defense.
[146:28.45]So there's defense and intelligence, and I'm going to scream in his face every time if he has an intelligence less than like 150.
[146:33.65]Let's see what he's got.
[146:44.66]His defense is actually terrible, though.
[146:48.01]I'm better off just hitting him without intelligence moves.
[146:51.19]Why would he have that high intelligence and not focus on defense?
[146:54.49]What a terrible build!
[146:56.13]Wow!
[146:57.76]What an idiot!
[147:05.90]I want to do the scratch.
[147:06.88]Okay, I gotta slow down.
[147:07.64]Let's build up some will.
[147:17.02]Why am I backseating this wolf?
[147:25.15]We don't even need to... We just need to stay alive.
[147:28.67]I could go for, like, a super probe attack if I wanted to.
[147:31.03]I don't have the will, though.
[147:33.05]Alright, he's... I don't know what he's doing.
[147:36.68]Man, he just got real confused.
[147:38.04]That's it.
[147:41.44]Game over.
[147:45.71]I'm gonna try to get the swipe.
[147:49.94]Holy shit, dude.
[147:50.68]He's doing like 50 moves in a row.
[147:53.90]Can I hit this once, please?
[147:58.58]It's kind of cool, I guess.
[148:04.32]Dogs are usually really good at winning against meatloaf.
[148:06.46]Well, not when it's condensed meatloaf.
[148:07.86]You know, there's probably like four or five servings in here.
[148:17.70]Alright, this guy, Whirl, has a lot of trouble with intelligence, so... Well, I killed him.
[148:25.19]I did?
[148:25.51]I killed him?
[148:29.35]Did I?
[148:31.85]This is a worm blow.
[148:35.95]Yeah, it is.
[148:38.66]Yeah, see, intelligence, we're not going to do any... We're just going to scream.
[148:43.46]Unless we get some higher percentages here.
[148:47.02]Because he can't handle it.
[148:52.69]No.
[148:54.55]Thought I could get a 50-50 there.
[148:56.55]There we go.
[149:02.94]Let's back off a little bit.
[149:04.34]Back it up.
[149:10.20]Mm-hmm.
[149:14.39]That's fine.
[149:18.15]Come on, get over there.
[149:21.27]Get it right here.
[149:25.29]Might not KO him this time.
[149:26.63]Eh, maybe we will.
[149:27.99]No, he dodged it.
[149:31.85]Wow.
[149:34.31]That's a lot of horse shit.
[149:41.19]Wow, that's like... Come on, man.
[149:43.77]62%?
[149:45.19]He's been at a disadvantage the whole time.
[149:46.64]Didn't even matter.
[149:49.09]It's alright, we win.
[149:54.13]Wow, it's just like real life.
[149:55.35]If you scream louder than someone else, you're the smarter loaf.
[150:00.69]Yeah.
[150:03.34]Just like in math class.
[150:06.08]Of course everybody knows that.
[150:07.02]When you go up to do your book report, and every student goes up and tries to scream louder than the last one.
[150:15.46]Okay, Johnny, come up here.
[150:16.81]Your book report was on, what was it?
[150:18.95]Huckleberry Finn, was it?
[150:20.39]Yeah.
[150:20.95]Okay, come on up and give us your book report on Huckleberry Finn.
[150:30.21]My book report on Huckleberry Finn by John Carmichael.
[150:45.70]That was a D you could have gone louder Hopefully that wasn't too loud you failed your book report Johnny, sorry
[151:16.48]I was clenching.
[151:19.04]Just like waiting for it.
[151:29.85]You woke up my cat?
[151:32.37]That was loud?
[151:33.19]It wasn't?
[151:33.63]God, of course it was.
[151:35.97]And we are just regressing.
[151:38.29]Honest to fucking god, let me tell you something.
[151:41.33]We're regressing as a stream.
[151:44.19]That's the third scream joke.
[151:46.82]That's the third time I've screamed to be funny in four days.
[151:52.88]I'm not doing that again.
[151:55.50]I'm not going to scream for like six months.
[152:02.91]We're not regressing back.
[152:04.77]I'm not going to scream for six months.
[152:08.11]There you go.
[152:09.03]Time stamp it.
[152:13.27]Yes, you will.
[152:13.75]No, I won't.
[152:17.19]I'm like over 30 years old.
[152:31.88]It's time to stop screaming.
[152:33.62]You know what I mean?
[152:34.18]This is shit that you learn to not do when you're 11.
[152:38.08]It's time to stop screaming on stream.
[152:40.88]That's my New Year's resolution.
[152:49.49]I gotta hear this.
[152:51.59]I want to see how bad this was.
[152:56.31]Hold on.
[152:56.59]Let me plug my... I want to see how much I should be embarrassed by this.
[152:59.21]Because it's probably like at least 40% embarrassment.
[153:03.19]Let me see.
[153:04.81]Ah, fuck.
[153:05.33]Let's see what we got to work with here.
[153:08.17]Come on.
[153:13.81]Okay, Johnny, come up here.
[153:15.17]Your book report was on, what was it?
[153:17.29]Huckleberry Finn, was it?
[153:18.75]Yeah.
[153:19.31]Okay, come on up and give us your book report on Huckleberry Finn.
[153:22.21]Pretty good at changing between characters, I think.
[153:28.58]My book report on Huckleberry Finn by John Carmichael.
[153:38.37]Shopping on papers, it's funny.
[153:44.09]It was alright.
[153:51.83]I could have gone harder than that.
[153:53.45]You know, I take back my scream ban.
[154:00.13]I don't need to ban the screens.
[154:02.27]That's another New Year's resolution.
[154:04.53]My New Year's resolution should be to get a gym membership and then don't go, like, three days later.
[154:08.45]By the way, that's funny I say that.
[154:09.97]I've been paying for a gym membership for, like, a year and a half now.
[154:14.14]It's ten bucks a month, every month.
[154:16.04]I haven't gone to the gym in more than eight months.
[154:19.46]Thanks for reminding me of that.
[154:21.18]I'm going to cancel that tonight.
[154:25.24]Yeah, comes out every month.
[154:29.07]Alright, let's move back on to the game here.
[154:35.56]On stream.
[154:36.74]Why is that backtracking?
[154:39.60]Oh, it is backtracking.
[154:41.12]That's the definition of the word backtracking.
[154:44.82]Oh, are we going to break this meatloaf's neck on camera or what?
[154:48.06]What are we going to do to him?
[154:50.06]What?
[154:50.46]Why am I... What are you talking about?
[154:51.84]What am I fucking talking about?
[154:54.66]Why did I go there?
[154:56.57]He's fine.
[154:57.09]He's not even two years old.
[155:06.69]Oh my fucking god.
[155:09.10]We're gonna move on quickly.
[155:10.94]Quickly.
[155:13.54]Alright, so, schedule.
[155:17.26]Item.
[155:18.76]I'm lost.
[155:19.68]I'm lost.
[155:20.06]Schedule.
[155:22.33]He needs a little bit more in the defensive department.
[155:24.41]Okay.
[155:29.67]I've become unhinged.
[155:30.85]I've become unhinged.
[155:32.29]It's over.
[155:33.22]The jar came off the pickles.
[155:35.73]And it ain't coming back on.
[155:36.74]He dropped it in the garbage can.
[155:39.98]Did he just sleep twice?
[155:41.02]I don't even know.
[155:42.16]I'm trying to compose myself again.
[155:44.88]Defense and intelligence.
[155:45.76]That's what it was.
[155:47.92]We're gonna do training.
[155:49.19]Defense.
[155:49.73]Training.
[155:50.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[155:52.37]Wait a minute.
[155:52.67]Wait a minute.
[155:52.95]Wait a minute.
[155:54.11]This is the official tournament.
[155:55.11]It's coming up here.
[155:56.57]Okay.
[155:58.41]Let's just do... What's the number one thing I need?
[156:02.58]I would probably say intelligence.
[156:05.92]Let's just try to get it up as high as I can.
[156:12.52]Let's just get it up there.
[156:16.70]And he blew it.
[156:17.46]It's alright.
[156:21.86]Don't punish him.
[156:22.50]He's fine.
[156:23.29]We got a major tournament coming up here.
[156:26.03]He's very happy.
[156:30.22]Season being shaped.
[156:30.88]Should be doing a good showing.
[156:32.32]Alright.
[156:32.70]Raw meatloaf as well.
[156:35.08]Battle.
[156:36.70]Thousand gold.
[156:37.28]Official tournament.
[156:37.92]This gets us into C if we win this.
[156:41.06]Let's do it.
[156:43.72]I pissed out all my brain cells.
[156:45.09]No, I've got plenty of brain cells.
[156:46.43]I'm fine.
[156:49.49]I never was a big drinker.
[156:50.59]Never did any drugs.
[156:56.25]I'm fine.
[156:56.87]I'm going to be completely fine.
[157:01.54]Yeah, he's backing out.
[157:03.38]Good.
[157:05.04]Have them all back out.
[157:08.92]Mopeto has decided to withdraw.
[157:10.36]It's 2-0.
[157:14.70]3-0.
[157:14.86]Do it again.
[157:16.54]Michael has decided to withdraw.
[157:17.88]3-0.
[157:18.96]Right off the bat.
[157:19.70]No challenge at all.
[157:20.47]I'm already number one.
[157:23.59]Alright.
[157:24.31]Gotta beat Gurren, and I gotta beat Whirl.
[157:25.87]Those are the only two they have to beat.
[157:26.95]And I keep beating them over and over again.
[157:29.03]So why would I lose now?
[157:35.87]You lose IQ and you pee.
[157:43.17]Lost my... No, I told you.
[157:45.09]Half the times... Half the times, it's me joking around.
[157:51.14]Look, I drank, like, a large coffee.
[157:54.80]No, I didn't.
[157:55.16]That's a lie.
[157:55.92]I had two Gatorades.
[157:56.90]You watched me drink them.
[157:59.72]So, we're gonna do... His defense is not that bad, but his intelligence is... Just scream in his face a couple times.
[158:12.90]Got some of his will.
[158:13.62]That's good.
[158:15.46]Go for a scream in the face.
[158:19.92]Again.
[158:21.80]Back it up.
[158:22.58]That was a crit.
[158:24.79]I'm fine.
[158:35.31]Kicking his ass.
[158:36.05]He's got nothing.
[158:37.81]Not even a contest.
[158:38.51]You lose.
[158:39.79]I'll see you at C cup.
[158:50.56]Random crits are fun and interactive.
[158:52.46]Are they random?
[158:54.70]I think there's a... one of the stats adds to it, right?
[158:58.46]Maybe?
[159:00.38]Alright, this is the battle to move out of this bracket so we never have to see Whirl again.
[159:04.65]Whirl has not lost.
[159:07.43]So this is going to decide which one of us gets to move on.
[159:22.50]Hopefully, I've beaten this guy like four times in a row.
[159:24.66]This would be an outlier if I lose here.
[159:28.83]No, he sucks.
[159:30.13]I'm gonna scream in his face five times and he's gonna lose.
[159:33.51]Just watch the will.
[159:40.56]Holy shit, that was a lot of damage.
[159:49.14]See, he's just getting desperate now.
[159:55.24]Guaranteed win.
[159:59.48]I don't even want to go anywhere.
[160:00.50]I want to stay right in his face.
[160:04.22]Let's kill him.
[160:05.00]Let's kill him.
[160:05.66]I want to kill him.
[160:07.28]I'm going to crush his head.
[160:08.44]Let's kill him.
[160:13.74]No.
[160:14.44]Is that going to kill him?
[160:15.94]I was trying to crush him.
[160:24.72]Jesus.
[160:26.02]Whoa there.
[160:28.78]He's fine.
[160:29.20]He's still alive.
[160:44.62]So that's 1500 bucks.
[160:47.26]We got a lot of money now.
[160:49.06]Can't wait to see the fame. 65.
[160:57.04]That puts us into the C category.
[161:01.04]Hooray, hooray.
[161:05.39]Go to the next level.
[161:06.13]Praise him.
[161:06.67]Yes.
[161:13.25]Which item do you want to give him this month?
[161:14.57]We have a lot of money.
[161:15.37]I think he deserves a good meal.
[161:20.95]Hi, this must be it.
[161:22.72]Please sign here.
[161:25.10]There you go.
[161:26.70]Thank you.
[161:29.58]It's official.
[161:33.28]Certificate.
[161:33.78]Jeremy, in recognition of your ability, you are promoted to R2.
[161:40.59]I'm not gonna do it.
[161:45.13]You know the next two letters.
[161:46.67]The letter and the number after that.
[161:47.79]I'm not gonna say it.
[161:48.84]I refuse.
[161:53.79]And oh, by the way, has it been 50 minutes?
[161:56.91]It has.
[161:57.43]Okay, time to pee for a third fucking time.
[162:00.78]Has it been 50 minutes?
[162:01.80]Yeah, time to go to the bathroom for a third time.
[162:05.06]Why is this on the clockwork?
[162:06.70]Who is doing this?
[162:08.08]Which one of you guys is casting a spell on me?
[162:13.20]Right on cue.
[162:15.63]It's unbelievable.
[162:16.67]That's what I thought it is.
[162:17.77]It's unbelievable.
[162:30.07]IQ is just pouring out.
[162:33.15]Yeah, who... Somebody casted a bladder spell to make it so my pee is hexed.
[162:38.93]Alright, I'll be right back.
[162:40.67]I'm not going to drink any more liquids after this.
[162:43.33]Ever again.
[162:44.99]I'm only going to eat dust.
[162:47.73]That's how I'm going to survive.
[162:48.57]I'm going to sprinkle cumin, turmeric, and some salad dressing on dust.
[162:53.98]And I'm going to just... I'm going to breathe it in.
[162:57.22]No more liquids for me.
[162:58.36]Be right back.
[165:47.48]You guys know the drill.
[165:49.68]You guys know the deal, man.
[165:51.84]I took one hit in that fight.
[165:54.71]Streamer has to do something fucking crazy, you know what I mean?
[165:56.97]I took one hit of HP.
[166:00.77]I told you it wasn't gonna happen.
[166:04.23]Like, gotta eat raw onion on stream.
[166:10.70]What the fuck?
[166:11.90]Wow.
[166:20.15]Please watch me.
[166:22.49]Please, God, don't leave the channel.
[166:24.21]Please watch me.
[166:28.66]I'm obsessed with viewer counts.
[166:30.12]Please don't fucking leave the stream.
[166:33.68]Okay, uh, let's go.
[166:34.62]Uh, schedule.
[166:45.55]Let's do re- is he tired?
[166:51.43]I'm leaving.
[166:57.58]I forgot.
[166:58.76]Did he rest?
[167:03.32]Yeah, I watched the video.
[167:05.88]Whatever the thing was.
[167:06.68]That was fucking weird.
[167:09.68]You know the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland?
[167:12.58]They made that guy... He turned into a person.
[167:16.51]And they made him say a bunch of words real fast, and there's books around him.
[167:19.11]I watched it.
[167:19.59]You want to hear my reaction?
[167:20.43]That's what you're looking for.
[167:21.55]It's on the Reddit.
[167:24.30]Go to the subreddit.
[167:25.20]The Jerma985 subreddit.
[167:26.58]There's somebody who's like, Jerma, please, I hope you watch this video and talk about it on stream.
[167:29.88]I just did.
[167:30.42]There it is.
[167:35.44]It's a weird video.
[167:37.76]It's a melting person.
[167:41.09]Nice reaction vid.
[167:42.01]Alright.
[167:42.27]Is he tired?
[167:48.43]The library worm video.
[167:49.47]Yeah, somebody wanted me to make a reaction to it.
[167:51.45]So there it is.
[167:51.91]There's your reaction.
[167:56.65]I have no con- By the way, I'm not plugging the subreddit.
[167:59.34]I have no control of that subreddit.
[168:01.02]It just exists.
[168:04.88]And I meticulously go through every single comment.
[168:09.22]Every day.
[168:10.81]I read every line.
[168:11.91]I read every comment on there.
[168:13.23]I need to make sure what people are saying about me.
[168:16.27]What if they say something bad that I don't like?
[168:22.35]What was the bottle noise?
[168:23.19]I'm... I have the Gatorade here, remember?
[168:28.89]Alright, rest.
[168:29.47]I'm gonna make him rest.
[168:30.59]I don't even remember if he slept or not, so he gets double sleep.
[168:36.08]Jeremy goes to downvote every comment.
[168:42.54]Oh, hello.
[168:43.82]Is this Jeremy's residence?
[168:46.28]Yes, it is.
[168:47.84]Hi, my name is Karn.
[168:49.42]I'm an explorer.
[168:51.99]I'm planning to explore the North Salem area to observe Titus Temple located there.
[168:57.46]I was wondering if you would allow raw meatloaf to accompany me.
[169:01.90]The expedition is four weeks.
[169:03.74]Anything found is yours.
[169:05.38]How about it?
[169:07.52]Let me think.
[169:10.30]It may be dangerous, but we may find some unusual items.
[169:15.71]You want me to send my friend with some random old creepy guy?
[169:22.24]And he may never return?
[169:23.36]Let's go.
[169:40.24]Expedition time.
[169:45.77]Are you ready?
[169:47.71]Take care of me.
[169:48.13]We will return after a month.
[169:49.79]Wait, you're taking the girl too.
[169:51.15]This is not right.
[169:52.27]I don't like this.
[169:56.49]Can you fail it?
[169:57.35]What happens if you fail?
[169:58.29]Do you all die?
[170:04.38]What is going on here?
[170:05.84]Okay, finally, is this the entrance to Titus?
[170:09.58]Yes, monsters were worshipped as gods here in Titus.
[170:13.21]Monsters.
[170:15.07]Those monsters rarely exist anymore today.
[170:18.24]We'll find out onward.
[170:22.72]Oh, I'm picking which way to go.
[170:25.12]The gate is broken.
[170:27.48]Do you want to let raw meatloaf handle it?
[170:33.16]Yeah.
[170:37.48]No, he can't break it.
[170:39.53]We can go... We can't go further.
[170:41.27]Should we let Ma... Should we... Break through it!
[170:48.67]He can't break it.
[170:49.87]We can't go further.
[170:51.33]No, okay, why would you give me the option to do that twice?
[170:58.26]No, you can't do that to me!
[171:00.98]What the fuck are you doing?
[171:02.30]You don't tell me to press X to get through the dialog.
[171:07.09]Oh my god, go this way.
[171:09.75]Jesus Christ.
[171:17.74]Let's go up from here.
[171:19.66]I didn't think skipping the dialog was... He's not gonna break it.
[171:21.94]That's a huge rock.
[171:24.12]No, he's not gonna take care of it because he can't.
[171:25.72]This way.
[171:31.92]What are you doing?
[171:34.59]What?
[171:39.55]What was the point of that?
[171:42.07]That didn't do anything.
[171:42.87]Why did he turn immediately around?
[171:47.79]What is going on?
[171:53.13]Okay... What about the rock?
[171:57.72]Can he take care of a rock?
[172:00.28]No, he can't.
[172:02.06]Uh, I can't do anything.
[172:05.02]I literally can't go in any direction.
[172:08.93]Can I go backwards?
[172:13.85]Why did he turn around from here?
[172:14.99]I don't understand this.
[172:15.65]Look, watch.
[172:16.07]Ready?
[172:16.49]What?
[172:16.65]Is this the end of the map?
[172:24.73]I can't break anything.
[172:26.04]I can't go anywhere.
[172:27.94]I guess we're gonna go this way.
[172:30.46]No, we're not.
[172:34.76]Can we just leave?
[172:35.64]Because I can't go anywhere.
[172:49.88]Keep trying to break it.
[172:51.00]Is that gonna actually work?
[172:59.18]I'm just gonna have him try to break it three times and see what happens.
[173:03.04]He can't break it.
[173:07.74]This is a waste of an entire month.
[173:11.47]We only got two days left.
[173:15.67]We can't go any further.
[173:20.21]Oh, you can't break it.
[173:23.73]Try it again.
[173:26.69]If I die on this trip, I'm going to be so mad.
[173:28.27]Alright.
[173:39.88]Into the fryer later, I think.
[173:46.46]Time's up.
[173:49.20]So how'd you like it?
[173:50.98]It went so fast.
[173:52.66]Too bad we didn't get to do all we wanted.
[173:54.70]We didn't get to do anything.
[173:57.69]Don't be.
[173:58.29]Not everyone can be a success.
[174:00.49]That's such underhanded insult.
[174:06.64]I ate that raw onion and now that's all I taste.
[174:08.44]It's gonna make me throw up.
[174:17.30]All I can taste is like somebody's armpit right now.
[174:20.50]I'm going to ruin onions for you guys for the rest of your life.
[174:23.88]Onions just smell like body odor.
[174:27.26]My breath smells like somebody's armpit now.
[174:31.30]I just ruined onions for everybody here.
[174:32.70]Sorry.
[174:33.53]But it's true.
[174:33.95]Rest.
[174:35.87]Rest.
[174:53.71]Oh, here he is.
[174:54.37]Hey, I have a present for you.
[174:56.75]You know that everything's on sale.
[175:00.89]Two raw meatloaf.
[175:03.60]Wait, look what I've got.
[175:06.82]How's it going?
[175:07.32]I've been your greatest fan since your last match.
[175:09.24]You are something else, man.
[175:10.88]I already have tickets to your next match.
[175:12.16]Don't let me down.
[175:12.82]I'll be cheering you on for you.
[175:13.68]I love you.
[175:15.08]Oh, we have fans.
[175:15.84]Uh-oh, isn't that sweet?
[175:19.66]Fry you later.
[175:26.89]Hey, it's me, Mr. Sneak Man.
[175:30.01]Yeah, don't you know every voice is the same voice for me?
[175:37.24]He's almost three years old.
[175:38.24]I got a feeling we should probably put him in the fryer later.
[175:44.54]I could train.
[175:45.80]Train what, though?
[175:46.58]Just go all in on intelligence?
[175:49.80]Yeah.
[175:52.72]Yeah, he read my fan mail on stream.
[175:58.53]Can train on any course.
[176:01.39]Oh, wow.
[176:01.99]We have new courses.
[176:04.97]Okay.
[176:07.44]We can do anything.
[176:08.50]Speed, life, power, intelligence, skill, defense.
[176:13.42]Defense and intelligence are the ones.
[176:18.32]Intimidation is the next upcoming thing to learn.
[176:24.16]Power.
[176:25.32]Big Ravage is the next move.
[176:28.72]No, we gotta do it.
[176:29.58]We're going all in.
[176:30.26]This is an intelligence character.
[176:31.50]We have to stick with it.
[176:32.24]Let's do intelligence.
[176:39.77]We'll do defense after.
[176:51.29]Anybody with over 250 of a stat is insanely dangerous.
[177:03.22]Especially when we're getting up to the C level here.
[177:07.82]You need like 280 and something.
[177:11.79]His int level went up.
[177:12.49]That's good.
[177:16.29]Did you learn a new move yet?
[177:17.63]No?
[177:22.09]What a breeze.
[177:23.33]No failures.
[177:23.91]Good.
[177:28.57]He was not successful.
[177:29.65]Don't punish him for no reason.
[177:36.56]Right in the camera?
[177:38.24]What is it?
[177:39.54]He is going through his most important stage now.
[177:42.18]Take good care of him.
[177:43.20]Uh-oh.
[177:45.60]Give him some rest.
[177:46.30]What do you mean his most important?
[177:47.66]Is that a way to say that he's going to go to a better place?
[177:52.70]His most important stage now.
[177:58.14]That's a nice way to say that, like, they're on the way out.
[178:07.71]He's in his prime.
[178:11.09]He seems to be in shape.
[178:11.85]He should make a good showing.
[178:12.69]What do you think?
[178:16.97]Is he ready?
[178:18.05]For a C tournament?
[178:20.75]Let's give it a try.
[178:22.43]Two thousand bucks.
[178:23.19]There are eight monsters.
[178:24.83]Only two thousand dollars?
[178:26.08]What is this cheap bullshit?
[178:28.48]There's two thousand dollars for the last one.
[178:30.74]Lookit!
[178:31.40]A D tournament's two grand!
[178:35.62]And this is much more tiresome.
[178:40.31]Yeah, save the game.
[178:41.03]You're right.
[178:41.87]Good call.
[178:54.65]He's elderly.
[178:55.31]Don't make him fight.
[178:57.61]No, he's alright.
[178:58.53]He'll be fine.
[178:58.99]We're gonna fuse him with something.
[179:02.13]We're gonna get a couple more CDs and we'll fuse him with something else.
[179:07.80]Let's do it.
[179:12.71]They reach teen, adult, old, and frail.
[179:17.56]We're going to get to see some new participants, I would say.
[179:20.94]Yep.
[179:21.60]There's a lot of monsters here.
[179:24.60]Alright.
[179:26.28]Raw Meatloaf versus Make'em.
[179:34.49]It's probably going to be high speed.
[179:45.02]fuse these two together more evolved music this guy looks a little a little intimidating here he's kind of the same person as me this is a worm that's a worm mixed with a eyeball alright so it's not we don't want to hit him with intelligence maybe not I think we want to do power moves here although not really I'm I outclass him he's 322 health he's gonna outlast me
[180:15.84]Not if I hit him with a few of those.
[180:17.28]Three in a row.
[180:24.83]Good.
[180:25.73]Good damage.
[180:26.23]Alright.
[180:26.43]He's down to my level now.
[180:27.31]Just break it up.
[180:28.21]Break it up.
[180:29.35]Pull it back a little bit here.
[180:36.96]Stay back.
[180:39.50]Yeah, he is intelligence.
[180:40.64]He spits.
[180:45.78]You thought you were prepared to take on me?
[180:48.60]Huh?
[180:49.44]Don't think so.
[180:54.17]Missed.
[180:57.57]It's alright.
[180:59.35]I kind of want to do... I want to end it with... No.
[181:03.23]Do the short thing, man.
[181:04.05]I've been doing intelligence.
[181:04.95]Why would I do anything else?
[181:06.51]His health is so high, I don't want to give him a chance to hit me with some huge crit.
[181:11.47]It's alright, we win.
[181:12.45]That's a V. It's a victory.
[181:22.24]The health poos are getting much larger.
[181:25.60]I gotta focus on health for the next leg of the journey here.
[181:34.70]Ramilov versus Boran.
[181:36.14]Health poos.
[181:44.34]Yes.
[181:46.96]Prepare for victory.
[181:51.95]Looks like 300 is the minimum viable amount you should have, I would assume.
[182:00.13]This guy's 140.
[182:00.97]This guy sucks.
[182:02.74]Wow, that 242 power, though.
[182:04.50]Okay.
[182:06.28]Just like his baby brother, we get a scream in his face until he's dead.
[182:13.62]Yeah, he can't handle it.
[182:14.38]Do it again.
[182:14.76]Quick.
[182:16.08]Don't even give him a chance.
[182:17.36]Again.
[182:19.32]Stunlock.
[182:23.53]Can I flawless victory this guy?
[182:26.11]I might be able to.
[182:27.99]Damn it.
[182:29.35]Oh well.
[182:32.91]Now that I can't flawless, let's just get some will up here.
[182:40.40]Done.
[182:42.03]Why is this guy so good?
[182:47.52]If he had hit me with even two or three moves, that would have been a lot of trouble.
[182:55.12]Gorgon.
[182:55.72]Alright.
[182:59.53]Meatloaf versus Obi-Wan.
[183:06.15]What is Obi-Wan's record?
[183:08.93]One and one?
[183:12.58]He lost to Quartly, who we haven't seen.
[183:14.64]You're the only hope.
[183:27.99]Is that a worm dog?
[183:31.91]This music is terrible.
[183:35.57]Did they get the songs from 3D Movie Maker?
[183:37.56]Jesus Christ, that was bad.
[183:40.33]Somebody just went into GarageBand and put the horn in random places.
[183:43.97]This guy's terrible.
[183:46.37]You are done.
[183:53.61]He does have really high skill, though.
[183:55.51]It's not going to help him.
[183:57.70]It's not going to help you.
[183:59.46]Not going to help you from the two-hit kill scream.
[184:07.54]I already won.
[184:16.47]See you later.
[184:22.18]Who else is... Gorgon is currently 3-0 as well.
[184:25.12]He looks like the challenge here.
[184:26.24]Here he is.
[184:26.58]Here come the two top seeds.
[184:33.71]This dude's gonna have like 300 defense and 500 health or something stupid.
[184:46.20]Is he lightning?
[184:46.76]What is he combined with?
[184:54.11]Oh, his HP is ti- I'm gonna kill him in two hits.
[184:56.75]300 power, but what's with the health?
[185:00.63]Low speed, low- I'm gonna kill him in two hits.
[185:03.85]This guy's dead.
[185:04.99]The same thing's gonna happen.
[185:05.75]I'm gonna crit him right now.
[185:06.75]I'm gonna one-hit kill him.
[185:15.98]99% and you dodged it come on his speed is less than a hundred That was horse shit Give me a break back it up back up back back back back back back back I'm still winning percentage-wise
[185:44.56]I can't get hit by one of those again.
[185:49.71]Come on!
[185:50.79]What the fuck?
[185:54.29]Just stay away.
[185:55.33]Back him up over and over again.
[185:57.87]As long as you don't get hit by one of these huge overhanded swings.
[186:04.28]Three, two, one.
[186:06.04]He's... It's over.
[186:06.92]I win.
[186:11.69]The guy with less than 100 speed dodges every attack when I have a 60% chance to hit him.
[186:29.96]He hits hard?
[186:30.48]Yeah, if I took one or two hits.
[186:34.48]That'd be bad.
[186:35.34]Alright, who's the number one?
[186:37.20]Misha.
[186:37.68]This is a monster I have never seen.
[186:39.34]Okay, Misha.
[186:42.14]By the way, Misha has lost every single fight.
[186:49.47]Misha, you're about to be 0-5.
[186:54.73]So don't be scared of the end here.
[187:08.42]That's just...
[187:10.75]That's just a nicer version of the gremlin woman from Gremlins 2.
[187:18.49]No, the vegetable gremlin.
[187:20.78]That's the vegetable gremlin woman from Gremlins 2.
[187:25.00]Why are you so bad?
[187:25.84]These stats are great.
[187:28.38]Power moves.
[187:29.00]No, don't do any intelligence here.
[187:41.42]Oh, shit.
[187:42.16]Okay, be careful here.
[187:46.66]Oh, fuck.
[187:47.24]I don't want to be the one who has to lose.
[187:53.53]My percentages are so bad right now.
[187:55.07]Why?
[187:55.37]I will... Okay, come on now.
[188:03.69]No more fucking around.
[188:06.09]How did she lose five times?
[188:08.29]She has so many cool moves.
[188:18.00]She's like fucking fire and brimstone and how did you lose this many times?
[188:22.42]I'm gonna lose.
[188:29.84]I'm gonna lose this fight.
[188:34.16]Hit her!
[188:42.99]Yeah, I just, I lost.
[188:43.83]I couldn't hit her with anything.
[188:48.76]I think that's 40% hit percent chance against the person that was 0-4.
[188:52.25]I'm still gonna win.
[189:00.56]Raw Meatloaf versus Qwerty.
[189:03.68]He's 2-3.
[189:05.64]I'm 4-1.
[189:06.42]Anybody else 4-1?
[189:08.90]Yeah, Gorgon is 4-1.
[189:10.35]Of course he is.
[189:10.87]I'm so dumb.
[189:17.15]Should have screamed.
[189:17.89]Well, even if I screamed at her, her intelligence was like 220.
[189:20.69]It wouldn't do any damage to her.
[189:22.75]That trumpet.
[189:36.75]Oh my God, this guy's speed.
[189:39.65]Speed intelligence.
[189:40.71]He's across the board really good.
[189:48.26]I get a sap will from this dude.
[189:52.18]25%.
[189:53.98]What terrible percentages.
[189:55.38]I'm not gonna hit him once.
[190:04.34]I got lucky.
[190:05.04]Two times in a row there.
[190:09.84]Not even worth doing.
[190:10.92]I have to do the intelligence boost.
[190:13.95]I'm gonna sneeze.
[190:14.65]I'm gonna sneeze.
[190:17.97]Oh, it hurt.
[190:18.57]That just hurt my fucking whole head.
[190:20.11]Alright, at some point you have to go for it with less than 30%, you know what I mean?
[190:29.68]And of course, why do I hit this dude?
[190:32.88]But for the life of me, I cannot touch that fairy.
[190:40.57]Like, I just hit 27%, 37%, 35%, 28%.
[190:41.29]I was at like 40-50% against the last person.
[190:55.30]And here it comes down to... Did he lose?
[191:00.23]What's his record?
[191:01.81]Fuck, no, he's 5-1.
[191:04.33]What is it?
[191:04.95]Entau.
[191:06.65]Entau.
[191:09.75]Fuck, he's 5-1 as well.
[191:15.42]There are three of us that are 5-1.
[191:18.58]This is one of them.
[191:23.07]Revenge of the sea.
[191:28.59]Well, that's how percentage chance works.
[191:31.42]That's true.
[191:37.62]Here we go.
[191:37.92]He's going to have really high intelligence.
[191:42.56]His defense is just crazy.
[191:46.03]Yeah, we have to just scream in his face.
[191:48.17]There's nothing else I can do about this.
[191:49.37]His defense is way too high for me to even hurt him.
[191:57.03]Time to scream.
[191:57.73]No, didn't want to do that.
[191:59.93]That was the wrong move.
[192:00.73]I was on the wrong button.
[192:01.55]At least he's not doing that much damage.
[192:07.27]Neither am I. This is going to be a war of attrition here.
[192:13.24]Because we're not going to do any damage to each other.
[192:18.24]It's all about who's... I'm saying it's all about who gets the percentages, and apparently it's this guy this time.
[192:29.33]I've got I can't just spend will I have a dodge a couple times here Dodge thank you.
[192:35.55]Thank God What the fuck that's three times in a row Finally I'm getting good.
[192:50.95]I'm getting good dodge rolls here
[192:57.24]I don't know, what percentage is the, 82?
[193:01.00]Come on!
[193:01.54]That's such bullshit.
[193:12.90]Fucking lost three or four rolls in a row of 64%.
[193:16.79]That's so stupid.
[193:26.84]Try a different move.
[193:28.26]He had 343 defense!
[193:32.49]I have 160 power, he had 343 defense.
[193:36.83]I would be doing 4 damage to him if I hit him.
[193:39.07]And that takes like, that takes 10 to 20 will.
[193:46.62]I still made money, doesn't matter.
[193:54.19]You want me to drop my face on a guy that is gonna not even scratch him if I hit him?
[194:08.68]How did Gorgon win?
[194:09.62]I don't know, that's weird.
[194:14.99]He did his best.
[194:16.15]You want to encourage him?
[194:17.21]Sure.
[194:18.99]Let's be nice.
[194:25.63]have money alright so let's let's talk about what happened there I came in third place I still got money I still have enough money to train I think health is probably pretty important at this point health and maybe some more power or maybe I just do I stay with uh intelligence
[194:56.79]It seemed like INT is the right path because... It's time to take him behind the shed.
[195:08.54]Do speed.
[195:09.08]Yeah, defense is not the problem.
[195:14.41]We'll do speed and intelligence for a little while.
[195:17.53]We'll trade speed.
[195:18.15]We'll actually train speed.
[195:22.41]So we can try to get as many points as possible.
[195:32.09]We can actually do this.
[195:34.80]Breed him.
[195:35.86]You want to breed him?
[195:36.36]Should we combine him?
[195:37.72]Merge him with somebody?
[195:40.54]I don't have any good candidates to merge him with, though.
[195:43.10]I don't like any of them.
[195:43.94]I mean, Jax Rex is stupid.
[195:49.67]Skill would be good, too.
[195:50.49]You want to make a Jax loaf?
[195:57.92]No, I don't want another stupid mattress!
[196:00.90]I want, like, another monster!
[196:08.99]You wanna try a new s- Alright, let's- let's try a new- before we spend any money.
[196:12.43]Let's, uh, let's go to- let's go to town.
[196:14.71]Let's freeze him.
[196:15.79]Let's put a couple more discs in.
[196:17.12]Let's see what else- I gotta go find some more discs.
[196:18.70]I have a bunch of PlayStation 1 stuff over here.
[196:22.59]Uh, I have some PC games here.
[196:24.41]We got True Crime.
[196:25.85]True Crime Streets of LA.
[196:26.75]Let's see what we get.
[196:36.04]He's almost at 100 fame and 100 loyalty.
[196:37.72]He's good.
[196:46.08]Did you buy a handful of CDs at the thrift store?
[196:50.39]True Crime, Streets of LA.
[196:57.60]I wonder what we're gonna get.
[197:03.65]Go, go.
[197:07.23]We'll just get, like, just another wall.
[197:08.81]Uh, I also got... I mean, we'll put, yeah, we'll just do this one, because I wasn't able to even install this game.
[197:17.61]I'll show it to you in a minute.
[197:18.93]Because this one requires the camera to be on so you can see it.
[197:26.93]Yeah, we'll go through all the PC games that I was not able to install when we tried to play them.
[197:32.13]Alright, I was about to just put it in.
[197:33.39]Where's the... Don't lose track of the Monster Hunter.
[197:36.41]Not Monster Hunter, Monster Rancher.
[197:37.97]Alright, this is from the True Crime CD.
[197:43.95]Kidz Bop.
[197:44.55]I don't... Why do you think I have a Kidz Bop CD?
[197:49.60]Like, at least four of you said Kidz Bop.
[197:54.85]Something cool.
[198:01.71]And... It is... one of those eyeballs.
[198:13.40]It's just a... It's a pure Suzy-o.
[198:21.68]Okay.
[198:22.34]Wow, what a monster.
[198:23.16]Good luck raising him.
[198:25.31]He's funny looking.
[198:34.58]Uh, how about... I don't want this thing.
[198:37.02]I don't want to use one of these.
[198:37.86]It's like the di- This is the guy that's on the cover of the disk.
[198:40.68]I don't want to use the cover of the disk.
[199:18.41]Alright.
[199:21.45]Uh, this is the next one we're going to do.
[199:24.03]The next one is going to be, uh, the Men in Black the video game for the PC.
[199:31.34]This was for Windows 95.
[199:32.44]I couldn't even get this to run through a virtual machine, so we're going to put it in here.
[199:41.00]Men in Black the game.
[199:49.54]Make sure we get some good data out of this.
[199:51.20]Let's see what we get.
[200:33.16]Everyone that's asking, why did I do that?
[200:35.94]Uh, well there's a very, very easy reason why.
[200:39.41]Guys, look at the back of this disk, okay?
[200:42.21]You're gonna be angry at me for that?
[200:44.33]Can you see how scuffed up and scratched this disk is?
[200:48.35]This is Monster Hunter.
[200:49.65]Monster fucking rancher, Jeremy.
[200:51.52]I don't know if you can see it or not, but this is destroyed.
[200:56.50]Look at this thing.
[200:57.40]Let me get it in the right light.
[201:05.00]You think that's a problem?
[201:06.94]Plus, it's Men in Black, the video game for Windows.
[201:10.26]The game doesn't physically run anymore.
[201:12.46]You can't get this to work.
[201:14.24]You know how I know that?
[201:15.30]Because I tried to get this to work for two hours.
[201:18.90]It's not going to work.
[201:19.56]This is just a piece of plastic that I own in my house now.
[201:31.31]Let's see what we get.
[201:34.50]Here comes the accent.
[201:38.52]No, it's, it's, wait, we already had this dog.
[201:40.50]At least give us an alien.
[201:47.04]We already had this combo.
[201:50.05]It's a tiger, tiger, tiger.
[201:54.41]What was the name, what were the two guys' names?
[201:56.23]What was Will Smith's name?
[201:57.13]What was Tommy Lee Jones' name?
[201:58.81]It was like, D or something.
[202:00.65]Or like, oh, Agent K. What was it?
[202:05.54]This girl's got KD, right?
[202:07.42]For, like, the kill-death ratio.
[202:24.47]Hmm, not bad.
[202:29.76]Hmm, not bad, though.
[202:31.26]What else we got?
[202:33.67]I want one of those big rock fuckers, you know what I'm saying?
[202:36.99]Alright, Family Feud.
[202:39.57]This is the Louis Anderson Family Feud.
[202:41.26]I feel like we're gonna get something good out of this one.
[202:43.64]We'll freeze him for now, because his lower stats are actually pretty good.
[202:50.32]I want to fuse a rock monster and that worm wall, and we're gonna get something crazy.
[202:54.25]Alright, come on, Louis Anderson.
[203:05.13]You yourself are like a big fat rock wall.
[203:08.47]You better be on this disk.
[203:10.59]And no, I'm not going to scratch this one up for fun because guess what?
[203:12.95]That's a fucking classic video game that works.
[203:19.53]That worm wall has a name.
[203:20.97]Okay.
[203:43.77]And survey says... Louis Henderson already is a monster.
[203:55.65]Wow, dude, come on.
[203:57.82]He's like a classic fucking comedian.
[204:01.60]And he's about to give us the best monster we've seen so far.
[204:05.72]Here it is.
[204:06.08]I can already see it.
[204:09.00]Look at it.
[204:09.30]There it is.
[204:11.89]You didn't think we were going to get something fucking crazy!
[204:15.96]That is like an Egyptian serpent!
[204:23.04]This has got to be rare.
[204:24.48]That is a pure... Wow, what a monster.
[204:30.61]Good luck raising him.
[204:32.69]That's a good looking monster.
[204:33.81]We're going to have to call him Louie, right?
[204:43.28]What is it?
[204:43.74]Louie?
[204:44.86]Is it Louie?
[204:45.42]Louie?
[204:45.66]How do you... Louie.
[204:49.76]What's his name?
[204:51.78]Is it L-U-I-S?
[204:55.16]Or L-O-U-S?
[204:57.00]Like Louie.
[204:57.28]Louie's.
[204:57.72]Louie's.
[204:58.08]Oh yeah, Louie's.
[205:07.67]I like Louie's.
[205:13.15]Alright, that's Louise.
[205:14.09]There he is.
[205:16.31]Louise.
[205:21.70]Oh, boy.
[205:23.50]Ah, yeah.
[205:26.50]Okay.
[205:27.06]160, 150 in skill and power.
[205:34.14]Freeze him.
[205:36.23]We'll come back to you.
[205:39.99]I knew I could always count on Louie.
[205:42.01]Louie Anderson.
[205:43.70]Let's do like one or two more and then just, you know, throw the ones that we don't want into, you know, into a giant hole of fire and just burn them, whatever.
[205:54.71]Alright, we're going to do the American Idol CD.
[206:04.01]We'll do this will be the last one.
[206:06.91]Try him out in battle.
[206:07.55]I don't think I want to merge him.
[206:08.91]That's going to be weird, right?
[206:13.87]I don't think I want to do that.
[206:14.69]I think I want to just train that one.
[206:17.95]American Idol.
[206:25.08]Merge Louie and the Worm.
[206:25.98]I don't think I want to do that.
[206:26.84]I want to train Louie for a while.
[206:35.02]If you touch the goddamn wall, Jerma.
[206:44.22]Okay.
[206:45.84]American Idol.
[206:47.98]Thank you.
[206:53.16]Give us something good.
[206:55.67]This is just an original loot box opening.
[206:58.93]Except you don't have to pay any money.
[207:00.01]Well, I guess you do.
[207:01.61]You could go to your father's old Bruce Springsteen album collection and pull it out.
[207:06.21]And get like 30 CDs.
[207:07.33]You don't have to pay any money.
[207:11.82]American Idol.
[207:16.31]What is it?
[207:25.91]Same... Same exact... What if I fuse them together?
[207:31.41]Both are the exact same.
[207:32.93]Both fucking game shows.
[207:34.27]Rare.
[207:49.25]I have to remember this.
[208:00.58]This guy's just DNA food for somebody else.
[208:09.13]What are his stats?
[208:10.93]The same exact thing.
[208:15.77]Freeze him.
[208:18.41]What if I combine them together?
[208:23.07]Craft DNA.
[208:25.67]Just for the sake of it.
[208:26.71]Because I need to know.
[208:27.63]We're going to do... Who wants to be a millionaire?
[208:31.55]And see if we get a third one.
[208:36.16]Who wants to be a millionaire?
[208:37.08]Third edition CD.
[208:40.90]Maybe the... Maybe like the Naga Serpents are on... It's game shows.
[208:57.80]We'll find out.
[209:07.48]Fire Serpent.
[209:11.10]Oh, they would need to be the different... They would need to be blue, red, orange.
[209:17.60]Did I just put in the fucking WWF CD right now?
[209:21.04]No, I didn't.
[209:21.42]Okay.
[209:21.62]Alright, here we go.
[209:26.06]Are we gonna get three of them in a row?
[209:37.45]There's nothing there.
[209:41.09]What the fuck is that?
[209:47.56]Okay.
[209:49.14]Plant.
[209:52.74]It's a dodo bird.
[209:55.42]With three... Alright, that... I like this thing.
[210:01.42]That's a cool monster.
[210:06.81]Alright, I think I wanna fuse.
[210:08.75]We're gonna call him Philbin.
[210:20.98]This is a pure plant.
[210:22.34]Let's fuse Philbin and one of the- No, I want the plant.
[210:35.41]There's a more clever way I can write this, right?
[210:39.31]Philbin Salad?
[210:43.44]Regis Salad?
[210:45.78]How about just The Salad?
[210:46.98]No, because we're gonna fuse him immediately.
[210:49.04]I'm gonna save the game, I'm gonna fuse.
[210:52.26]Who cares?
[210:52.73]His name just can be The Salad.
[210:54.07]It doesn't matter.
[211:02.70]It can be misspelled.
[211:03.74]It doesn't matter.
[211:04.68]He's gonna get fused.
[211:05.66]Because I want a different type of salad.
[211:11.86]Save the game.
[211:12.38]Just call him Caesar.
[211:17.93]Why would... No, he's not a Caesar salad, though.
[211:27.05]What's a salad?
[211:30.27]Come on, you're just messing with me, right?
[211:34.84]Let's take a look at the various combinations.
[211:37.52]That's a lot of health for a level one monster, like just a zero years old.
[211:46.01]It's almost 200 HP.
[211:49.79]Everything else is really not that great.
[211:51.39]It's an intelligence monster.
[211:52.85]It's a high-int, high-light monster.
[211:54.67]Let's just take a look.
[211:58.59]It turns into a pot.
[211:59.43]That's good.
[212:02.65]Let's take a look.
[212:03.54]And by the way, I also have a CD fragment.
[212:05.18]500 gold, yep.
[212:13.34]This is where it gets tricky.
[212:17.48]So we've got the salad and DNA food.
[212:23.95]Let's see what happens.
[212:29.38]We're gonna get either a bad seed or a jungler.
[212:32.40]There's a 60% chance we're gonna get something called a bad seed.
[212:39.87]Isn't that something I don't... Don't you not want bad seed?
[212:49.85]Now I kind of want to do it.
[212:54.21]What about, should we do an item?
[212:55.75]Should I do a... I have a CD fragment.
[213:00.32]We have a mystic snake and a CD fragment.
[213:03.32]We could put a mango in there too.
[213:04.94]It's a salad!
[213:06.18]Of course it is!
[213:06.98]Of course we're putting a mango in there!
[213:08.63]Oh, come on.
[213:09.49]Fuck you.
[213:16.07]I can't put a snake in there either.
[213:17.39]CD fragment.
[213:19.67]A so-so combination.
[213:21.23]Want to proceed.
[213:29.40]For those of you that are very well seasoned in this game, what does the CD fragment actually do?
[213:38.12]Does it just give you more base stats?
[213:41.76]When I was like 15, I never did this.
[213:44.37]I just laughed while I put in CDs from my parents' collection.
[213:55.39]The fragments give you a rare monster.
[213:59.07]Don't.
[214:00.73]okay let's see okay what if we did the salad and Jack's rex where are they going to get a shrub or an aloha salad and Jack's rex
[214:29.73]No, I like bad seeds so far.
[214:36.41]What about KD and the salad?
[214:41.49]What about raw meatloaf?
[214:42.79]I'm not going to do it.
[214:43.37]I just want to see raw meatloaf and the salad.
[214:46.60]You're talking about a complete meal here, right?
[214:53.52]We're talking about a full dinner.
[214:56.90]New leaf ash rainbow or a usaba?
[215:11.12]What is the rainbow?
[215:13.12]Is it a bird?
[215:18.53]You saved it.
[215:19.55]Do it for the laughs.
[215:20.81]It is saved, but don't do it.
[215:25.47]Rainbow's a worm.
[215:31.83]Save the meatloaf.
[215:32.57]Well, this is like, we have the fucking food here.
[215:36.79]Usaba sounds like it could be, but that's not going to happen.
[215:39.35]It's an 8% chance to happen.
[215:51.14]Do it.
[215:52.02]Should I use a CD?
[215:55.05]Combine the dinner and use the CD.
[216:04.46]Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
[216:09.90]Let's just see what happens.
[216:13.81]A nice combination.
[216:15.35]You'll surely get a better one.
[216:21.73]I'm doing it.
[216:27.33]What is it?
[216:29.11]What is it?
[216:34.33]New leaf, mono plant.
[216:40.43]It's just a piece of watermelon.
[216:42.51]I hate this.
[216:44.43]I don't want this anymore.
[216:50.05]I don't want the watermelon.
[216:51.62]No, god damn it.
[217:04.81]I was gonna call him Rind.
[217:06.13]Let's call him Sweet Rind.
[217:14.39]This sucks, I wanna reload the game.
[217:26.36]Hey, Sweet Rind!
[217:28.24]We- Rewind!
[217:32.11]Sweet Ryan- You want me to rewind Sweet Ryan?
[217:39.54]You want me to do it again?
[217:40.24]Yeah, he sucks.
[217:50.07]I mean, he's not even one years old.
[217:55.95]He's got great stats.
[217:57.13]He sucks.
[217:57.83]He's so dumb.
[217:59.45]What does he have for moves?
[218:02.12]The same ones I had before.
[218:04.08]He's just... Here's the difference.
[218:06.34]He's younger with better base stats and looks like a fucking watermelon.
[218:09.92]That's the only difference.
[218:12.40]We've been playing with a wall for like four hours.
[218:25.94]How do I like get out of here?
[218:28.02]Data.
[218:33.68]How do I just turn off?
[218:34.52]I have to turn the game off.
[218:38.92]Reload.
[218:39.84]No, I have to turn the game.
[218:40.72]I have to press the power button.
[218:44.02]This is PlayStation 1, man.
[218:45.20]There's no, like, load data.
[218:49.43]Just gonna have to reset.
[218:50.29]Okay.
[218:51.77]Watch out for that blue screen.
[218:52.67]It's gonna flash you in the face in five seconds.
[218:54.47]There we go.
[219:05.99]Ah, that crispy sound.
[219:07.79]Remember that sound?
[219:08.40]1995.
[219:10.30]I'm like addicted to this game now.
[219:21.50]Am I going to become a Monster Rancher streamer for the next like month?
[219:25.88]I really wouldn't be surprised.
[219:38.88]Possibly.
[219:47.44]Load game.
[219:57.43]Try to win another monster.
[220:04.72]There he is.
[220:07.39]So let's go back to the lab, freeze him.
[220:12.16]I definitely want a plant, though.
[220:13.34]That seems like the dumbest monster to have in this game, and that makes me want it.
[220:19.60]Alright, so we have... Should I try that again?
[220:22.72]What do I do here?
[220:26.11]There's too many combinations.
[220:29.69]Should I do Bad Seed?
[220:31.95]Or just go for Bad Seed?
[220:34.91]It's either gonna be Rainbow or Bad Seed.
[220:38.19]Jack's Loaf, for the love of God.
[220:41.56]Let's see what we get.
[220:42.22]What are the possibilities here?
[220:47.40]We get Black Rex, Jura Wall, Shell, and a Gecko.
[220:58.13]Salad Meatloaf.
[221:00.95]No, no item.
[221:03.93]The chance to just get another wall...
[221:08.50]It's just going to be a wall that's green, and our T-Rex is going to not be green this time.
[221:14.60]The gecko is a 10% chance.
[221:16.92]No.
[221:18.86]I'd rather go for bad seed.
[221:22.58]The game's having a little bit of trouble here.
[221:27.22]You alright?
[221:28.73]You good, PlayStation?
[221:35.01]Hang in there, come on.
[221:43.27]I want to see what Bad Seed is like.
[221:45.07]I feel like that would be interesting.
[221:49.97]It's got a great name.
[221:54.37]Oh, I see.
[221:55.71]Whoever you put in first has the higher chance.
[221:58.88]Interesting.
[221:59.50]Okay.
[222:09.18]Gecko could be the return of the worm.
[222:14.64]What happens if you do two of these guys?
[222:17.70]Does it become like an ultra?
[222:20.57]Let's see.
[222:22.23]No.
[222:23.13]Hey, I wonder what happens if you put these two in here.
[222:25.75]Oh, you get this thing.
[222:27.97]Bad combination.
[222:28.97]You don't know what you'll get.
[222:30.55]Proceed.
[222:31.31]No.
[222:33.70]So you want to try to go for rainbow.
[222:34.88]Let's see how we can change our opportunity here.
[222:43.47]Rainbow is 20%.
[222:44.05]We're gonna be doing... You want me just to keep reloading until I get the rainbow worm?
[222:56.90]I'll try this a couple... I'll try to get the rainbow worm one more time after this.
[223:03.29]CD fragment.
[223:09.41]Nice combination.
[223:11.11]Rainbow worm.
[223:17.68]Here comes watermelon.
[223:22.58]Fucking goddammit.
[223:27.44]I'm gonna do this one more time.
[223:40.99]I ain't doing this all day to get a 20% roll.
[223:43.45]Not gonna happen.
[223:48.64]It was meant to be.
[223:53.32]Hold on a minute.
[223:53.80]Is this a really stupid idea?
[223:55.10]Shouldn't I level up the salad to C before I combine them?
[224:03.06]Wouldn't I want to have the salad have higher stats to combine with the thing that already has higher stats?
[224:08.53]Is that stupid or that sounds like a correct idea?
[224:12.43]Why would I do this right now?
[224:13.93]Let's go get the salad leveled up and then we'll combine them.
[224:17.54]Doesn't matter.
[224:18.38]It doesn't matter.
[224:24.41]It's probably a fixed seed.
[224:29.63]It is just base stats.
[224:30.57]Okay, so it doesn't matter.
[224:33.44]Dude, you used to be able to bring your memory card over to your friend's house and be like, look what I got, dickhead.
[224:42.90]And your friend would be like, what?
[224:44.64]You have, hold on, you have a rainbow worm?
[224:47.30]You're like, yeah.
[224:48.48]How'd you get so lucky?
[224:49.56]I didn't.
[224:52.22]I just turned off and on my PlayStation 1 250 times.
[224:55.46]Alright, so hold on.
[225:03.92]Is Strike 3, if we get Watermelon again, is that Strike 3 route we have to stick with Watermelon?
[225:08.28]How are we going to play this?
[225:22.83]Absolutely, I mean everyone's saying no, but that's just not fair We're gonna have to go back to sweet rind that's how that's the way we're gonna play it I don't care that we're doing that I'm not gonna do this all night guys Salad meatloaf equals watermelon it's meant to be
[225:51.27]Rainbow is now at a lower percentage chance.
[225:55.51]It was 20% before, now it's 10%.
[225:57.11]You guys wanted me to do this in reverse.
[226:02.84]I thought the goal was to get rainbow.
[226:05.34]Now we've lost 10%.
[226:18.35]Okay, okay.
[226:19.27]Meatloaf?
[226:22.69]Salad.
[226:26.11]There we go.
[226:26.75]Alright, now this is 20- 40% only.
[226:31.32]Use the CD fragment.
[226:37.52]Don't give me meatloaf, because if- Look, okay, if I don't get meatloaf and I get, like, something- I don't know.
[226:48.95]I don't want to use the watermelon.
[226:49.99]Don't make me use the watermelon, please.
[227:09.72]Uh, okay.
[227:19.87]This is just a dumb version of the thing we were just playing with for four hours.
[227:24.95]I can't do it.
[227:28.59]One more try.
[227:29.55]Last one.
[227:31.75]I'm not playing with sweet rind.
[227:33.52]Sorry.
[227:37.36]I'm gonna break my PlayStation 1.
[227:49.11]Bad seed, bad seed.
[227:56.90]Don't we want the rainbow worm though?
[227:58.62]Isn't that what everybody wants?
[228:00.20]It's what I want.
[228:05.30]We'll see what bad seed looks like.
[228:13.02]Bad seed and then combine bad seed with meatloaf is what we want to try.
[228:21.19]I like that idea.
[228:37.75]Sweet rind of riot.
[228:40.63]No.
[228:42.18]Come on, we can't just shoehorn ourselves into using a wall again for another indefinite amount of time.
[228:53.68]Rainbow is ranked second in the game overall.
[228:56.20]Alright, hold on.
[229:01.78]Let's just see what happens if we do Bad Seed.
[229:05.28]So that was the salad.
[229:09.29]And then DNA food.
[229:13.31]Which we get a Bad Seed.
[229:14.89]So we're not using a CD Fragment, right?
[229:16.97]No CD Fragment.
[229:21.29]Do it.
[229:21.41]What do we get?
[229:28.44]Bad seed.
[229:30.31]There he is.
[229:30.69]It's just a purple version.
[229:36.27]That's a cool monster.
[229:37.85]Give him a name.
[229:45.03]Uh... I have no idea what I want to call this.
[229:50.41]Fucking Mr. Eggplant.
[230:00.40]Lame, lame, lame.
[230:01.84]Twitch?
[230:02.38]This is just, this is like Twitch chat.
[230:04.34]Yeah.
[230:05.80]This is chat.
[230:09.06]Like, it's purple, it's got a bunch of heads all talking at the same time.
[230:12.34]Yeah, this is chat.
[230:14.88]This is you guys.
[230:15.54]Here you are.
[230:20.08]This is chat.
[230:22.56]Okay, here we go.
[230:23.22]Stats aren't really that bad.
[230:27.06]You guys are real dumb, though.
[230:30.67]A lot of skill.
[230:32.41]Not that quick.
[230:34.50]You're not that defensive.
[230:36.12]You have a really low IQ here.
[230:43.36]Now what happens if we combine Twitch chat and the meatloaf?
[230:49.51]I'm just wasting money at this point.
[230:54.01]Chat.
[230:56.79]And meatloaf.
[231:05.73]There's a chance to get a fucking watermelon, you see this?
[231:19.18]Don't do it.
[231:22.90]It actually is... fate if we get the watermelon again.
[231:36.64]A nice combination.
[231:37.58]Here we go.
[231:40.10]No watermelon.
[231:46.82]What is that?
[231:49.40]Usaba.
[231:49.84]We got an Usaba.
[231:50.56]I don't know what that means.
[231:52.23]It's just a three-headed chicken.
[231:55.73]What is this thing?
[231:56.43]It was an 8% chance to get this.
[231:58.15]Is this thing rare?
[232:04.39]It's a triple chicken.
[232:05.11]The...
[232:08.86]The tricking.
[232:10.82]The tri-chicken.
[232:12.60]The tricking, because they say he's a trickster too.
[232:14.48]What is his moves?
[232:15.10]What does he got for moves?
[232:26.13]Triple chicken.
[232:32.07]No, not tricking.
[232:34.91]Tricking.
[232:38.04]Like the chicken.
[232:40.34]Not the bad thing.
[232:41.66]Not the thing that you do without the bad guy.
[232:43.70]Not being bad.
[232:45.22]Tricking.
[232:50.34]Here it is.
[232:50.70]Tricking.
[232:52.66]And...
[233:03.26]It's awful.
[233:15.31]That is worse than default Jex Rex.
[233:48.04]Wait, hold on.
[233:48.68]He had the best move in the game?
[233:55.99]He had an S move?
[233:58.01]Did he?
[233:58.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[234:04.97]That was an 8% chance and his stats were terrible.
[234:08.33]But the idea is he has one of the best moves in the whole game that cannot be avoided.
[234:22.84]fuck do you everybody was laughing you see everybody was laughing at him and I was like I had to alright we're gonna get rainbow right now
[235:01.54]No, wrong way, wrong way.
[235:13.91]Give me the rainbow.
[235:15.55]Give me the rainbow worm.
[235:18.23]Seedy fragment.
[235:24.44]Here we go.
[235:26.87]Honest to God, there is a 60% chance to not get the fucking stupid watermelon rind.
[235:34.32]We can get an Usaba.
[235:36.52]Again.
[235:41.32]Rainbow.
[235:44.30]Give us rainbow.
[235:50.75]No, I don't want to use this.
[236:27.37]Hold on, everybody.
[236:36.15]Those stats are good!
[236:37.27]Those stats are real good!
[236:53.37]DNA food.
[236:57.73]And Asphar?
[236:59.61]No.
[237:01.74]No.
[237:02.82]No.
[237:06.22]Get rid of the Starburst.
[237:08.00]Look, I kept trying.
[237:10.08]He's only a 40% chance.
[237:12.56]And it's just ruining everything.
[237:13.98]These are all boxes.
[237:28.30]What is free?
[237:33.05]Look at the stats on free.
[237:36.73]Evil hair.
[237:39.41]We could get an evil.
[237:40.44]We could get an evil person.
[237:41.94]We could get evil a good guy.
[237:43.54]Evil person.
[237:44.36]Good person.
[237:46.80]Good guy.
[238:07.73]Come on.
[238:08.48]Give us a good guy.
[238:33.08]I don't even... This is just... S, G, T, T, G, G, G, I don't care.
[238:38.49]Look at how fucking awful this is.
[238:45.13]You're probably... We're not doing this anymore.
[238:53.24]We're done after this.
[238:54.66]We're gonna try this one last time.
[238:57.12]And we live with what we do.
[239:00.08]We live with it.
[239:04.64]That's it.
[239:07.12]I will accept the watermelon if it happens again.
[239:12.13]Don't use the CD fragment.
[239:13.46]Alright.
[239:13.72]I'm not going to use the CD.
[239:14.74]No CD fragment.
[239:28.55]You said that the last time.
[239:31.69]Live with it.
[239:32.37]You need to sleep in your own bed.
[239:35.05]Well, I can't help RNG.
[239:36.71]I'm trying to weigh the RNG because it's a 40.
[239:40.10]That's not a good chance.
[239:44.26]The majority of people that press that same button do not get sweet rind.
[239:50.25]60%.
[239:52.33]6 out of 10 times.
[239:54.93]We've rolled this at least 5 times.
[240:05.39]There is no RNG.
[240:06.01]What do you mean there is no RNG?
[240:11.53]It's predetermined.
[240:12.31]What do you mean it's predetermined?
[240:16.88]Huh?
[240:18.98]Why would it give me four options?
[240:23.98]If it's not predetermined.
[240:28.72]It's the CD.
[240:40.91]Here's raw meatloaf.
[240:41.71]Here's the salad.
[240:46.98]Seed of newly 40.
[240:48.46]Result but... It's possible that the RNG... Sometimes RNG is based on game state, so if you load the game state, the result will be the same.
[241:01.09]You're reloading the same seed.
[241:13.08]Actually, hold on a minute.
[241:13.84]This is like a game.
[241:14.68]This is like a 20 year old game.
[241:16.06]A 20 year old game.
[241:20.04]No CD, no.
[241:20.84]I'm not gonna put the CD in.
[241:24.02]Try it without the CD.
[241:24.98]Without the CD, it's a different seed.
[241:27.38]You understand?
[241:27.88]I'm not putting a CD in.
[241:34.02]No item.
[241:36.16]We just changed our fate here.
[241:38.02]Going against the timeline.
[241:47.11]Fucking god damn it.
[242:37.19]now cd him with something wait let I need to should I save it I don't know what I'd do here free I'm gonna freeze sweet Ryan now you talk now let's combine sweet Ryan with somebody else with the cd sweet sweet Ryan and who sweet sweet sweet Ryan and free
[243:06.74]Alright.
[243:08.34]This is a- We're putting the CD in- Wait a minute.
[243:13.07]No, we did this already!
[243:13.97]We did this already.
[243:14.87]We got the roomie thing already.
[243:21.43]Sweet Ryan is powerful.
[243:22.49]No, fuck it.
[243:24.89]No.
[243:25.77]We're playing the game with Sweet Ryan for a little bit.
[243:27.45]Sorry.
[243:29.93]I'm gonna get the stupid wall again.
[243:32.55]Let me just- Hold on.
[243:35.48]What about sweet rind and sea dose?
[243:39.74]Ice candy.
[243:46.74]Just a different food.
[243:48.26]We keep going from da food to food.
[243:58.89]Kelp.
[244:04.36]Let's do it the other way.
[244:06.02]A bad combination.
[244:07.54]I'm gonna listen to the dude with the mustache.
[244:14.44]Alright, what about Ratceratops?
[244:17.02]He's got pretty good stats.
[244:17.98]Ratceratops and Sweetrine.
[244:21.88]Velvet, Sponge, Leafy, or Iris?
[244:31.64]Free, then Sweetrine?
[244:34.88]This is a nice combination.
[244:36.02]We might get a sponge.
[244:42.88]Someone just said, go play the game.
[244:44.24]This is the game.
[244:46.45]We are experiencing the game.
[244:48.11]This is like, this is like half the reason why you play the game.
[244:51.89]So you, what, you said do free first.
[245:00.21]Free, let's see if we get a higher chance to get good guy here.
[245:04.14]Holy shit.
[245:04.86]Alright, here we go.
[245:05.97]Bingo.
[245:13.09]CD fragment.
[245:23.17]I'm going to put a CD.
[245:23.79]We're doing the CD fragment here.
[245:24.87]Here we go.
[245:26.03]Whatever the fuck this is, I don't care what it is.
[245:30.63]We're going to get... I don't care what it is.
[245:32.05]We're going to go from here out.
[245:34.34]CD fragment.
[245:35.38]What do you mean no CD?
[245:37.18]No, we want better stats.
[245:39.82]No grooming.
[245:40.56]No grooming.
[245:41.16]No grooming.
[245:41.70]And I'm going to fucking go.
[245:44.68]Save the game first.
[245:45.80]No, it doesn't matter.
[245:47.12]No, we're done.
[245:47.74]We're done.
[245:48.14]Free.
[245:49.20]Do it.
[245:49.64]Go.
[245:50.57]Go.
[245:51.03]Sweet Ryan.
[245:53.55]I don't care if I get the fucking chocolate milk person.
[245:56.95]CD fragment.
[245:58.29]Bingo.
[245:59.29]Do it.
[246:08.93]YES!
[246:12.83]We got Shadow the Hedgehog.
[246:26.98]I got a good name.
[246:37.30]No, that's stupid.
[246:41.12]Name him Liar.
[246:42.18]I miss Sweet Rind.
[246:45.92]Nobody misses Sweet Rind, okay?
[246:49.52]Edgehog?
[246:50.12]Alright, we'll name him the Edgehog.
[247:06.13]There.
[247:14.62]That was a pretty good base stats.
[247:20.96]And he already has a scream.
[247:25.69]Yeah, this is pretty good.
[247:28.61]We need more skill.
[247:30.77]Way more skill, because these hit percent chances are fucking terrible.
[247:44.45]Frogs.
[247:45.23]It really is the re-frog scream thing.
[247:49.93]Take him back to the ranch.
[247:50.61]Let's go.
[247:52.49]I bought it and named him Edgehog.
[247:53.93]I hate this.
[248:06.80]Meatloaf died for this.
[248:12.44]Let's do it.
[248:13.26]Let's work.
[248:14.24]Go to work.
[248:16.54]We need skill.
[248:18.11]Skill and power, right?
[248:23.43]Yeah, let's do skill.
[248:24.83]He needs it bad.
[248:26.91]Where's skill?
[248:27.43]Alright, hunt.
[248:32.87]Sorry, they always fail.
[248:38.84]Firm right off the bat.
[248:45.48]Work, hunt, skill, come on.
[248:48.50]He will wipe the floor with everybody in the first few competitions.
[248:56.18]Aren't the bunnies the worst monster?
[248:58.70]They're the worst monster in the game.
[249:01.27]I miss Sweetrine.
[249:02.69]I miss Badseed.
[249:03.85]Everybody was laughing their ass off at that.
[249:06.91]And hated it.
[249:07.57]You want me to go back and use Sweetrine?
[249:12.11]No.
[249:12.59]Shut.
[249:12.95]Jeremy, stop it.
[249:16.19]work we're getting to we're gonna come don't we're gonna combine edgehog into somebody else don't worry guys we're gonna accidentally get another sweet Ryan anyways I despise everything this monster stands for
[249:50.01]Oh, God.
[249:51.10]God damn it.
[250:21.73]What the fu- I just didn't even do it right.
[250:39.38]Nah, you guys, that's not gonna happen.
[250:43.48]Yeah, the democracy has spoken.
[250:49.20]In the meantime, we're gonna, we're gonna just do a little bit of, we're gonna work more on skill.
[250:58.54]Holy shit, somebody gave $100.
[250:59.39]That's a, that's a lot of bits right there.
[251:05.63]KXC501, thank you for the $100.
[251:11.89]10,000 bits.
[251:13.21]And you say, you made this abomination, now you must live with it.
[251:17.08]L-U-L.
[251:21.21]Thank you, KXZ.
[251:25.91]501 for the $100.
[251:28.81]Appreciate it, man.
[251:31.19]We are.
[251:31.73]We're staying with it.
[251:35.04]Skill again.
[251:40.64]Yep.
[251:40.90]Sorry, guys.
[251:41.62]It's over.
[251:42.30]Poll is now closed.
[251:43.90]53 to 47%.
[251:44.74]No, not rewind to the Rhine.
[251:49.46]It's not going to happen.
[251:53.65]What does he have for skill?
[251:55.01]155?
[251:57.75]He's great though.
[251:58.53]He's not even one years old and he's so, so talented already.
[252:07.12]What game system is this on the PlayStation 1?
[252:14.66]Rewind to the Rhine.
[252:17.10]I missed the worm.
[252:18.16]You can't just attach yourself to every monster.
[252:23.24]Give him potatoes and then we're gonna do real training.
[252:27.44]And then he's gonna just blow through.
[252:28.82]We're gonna get him to C. You guys want to go back to wormy?
[252:36.59]Splisho?
[252:41.03]That you're talking about like six hours ago.
[252:43.09]Yeah, I don't care.
[252:49.67]I want this guy to be unbeatable.
[252:53.53]And we're doing skill again.
[253:02.46]I can't love this monster.
[253:04.66]But you're not supposed to love this monster.
[253:07.48]We're only using this monster for money.
[253:10.88]Once this monster makes us enough money, we will combine him with a stupid... We'll put... We'll put in like fucking Family Feud 2 and we'll get Sweet Ryan again.
[253:25.73]Look, Edge... Can I change his name?
[253:28.19]I don't want to say that name.
[253:36.54]You're not supposed to love him.
[253:37.38]Yes, he's evil.
[253:37.96]That's not why... You don't love the evil one.
[253:39.60]You just... You take the money that they're gonna make.
[253:46.56]Everybody hates this thing.
[253:54.48]Nobody likes Edgehog.
[253:56.62]It's the worst.
[254:00.11]Alright, just go to bed.
[254:06.62]Wait till you see him in battle.
[254:13.73]Even you hate it.
[254:14.61]No, I can't.
[254:15.53]There's a guy, look, remember how every stream I answer to the one person in chat?
[254:21.64]A guy was in here saying, just fucking play the game.
[254:25.78]And I'm sitting there going, you know what, he's right.
[254:27.63]At some point we gotta move on.
[254:29.19]We played, half the game is making the monster, the other half is doing the battles.
[254:33.53]I'm gonna listen to that one guy.
[254:34.63]Am I gonna be able to have enough money to...
[254:43.68]Sweet Ryan had heart.
[254:44.98]Edgehog only wants the money.
[254:46.28]And yes, that's fine.
[254:48.00]But do you understand the delicious DNA that we are going to extract from Edgehog?
[254:54.41]I hate his name.
[254:56.33]I wish it was anything else.
[254:57.11]It could be the letter A. I was so excited because we were trying to get the evil guy, the good guy.
[255:05.07]This was evil hair.
[255:06.68]Just let him fight once and we'll see how we feel after that.
[255:11.31]Just let him get a chance to warm up to you guys.
[255:23.97]His stats are going to be insane.
[255:27.67]He's already almost at 190, 200 skill.
[255:35.16]We'll see how many times you guys PogChamp when he does his first move.
[255:50.39]Punish him.
[255:50.79]I think he's gonna sleep.
[255:54.13]Just give him potatoes so he's not spoiled.
[255:55.71]Oh, here comes Jax Rex with the... Hey, it's half off.
[256:03.62]To Jeremy.
[256:05.00]Yeah, I can't afford it anyways.
[256:06.60]I don't have enough money to do it.
[256:10.01]I can't get there.
[256:11.99]I need to compete.
[256:15.96]Alright, so we got a tournament coming up here in two days.
[256:18.20]Let's rest and then we're going to do one more into skill and go.
[256:20.91]This guy's just DNA bait.
[256:27.41]It doesn't matter.
[256:30.93]Where's the tournament?
[256:31.45]We're going to get this guy to C as fast as possible.
[256:34.79]Summer E cup.
[256:36.13]Summer D cup.
[256:39.15]Where's the official cup?
[256:41.45]Cricket Cup.
[256:42.49]Official Cup.
[256:43.17]Alright.
[256:44.57]He just has to blow through these tournaments.
[256:47.01]Every time there's an official tournament, he's going to do it.
[256:52.24]Every monster is going to forfeit because he has such high stats.
[257:01.23]201.
[257:02.31]New skill level.
[257:09.44]battle just take a look he may it doesn't matter he's and he's not loyal but he'll be fine this is the equivalent of a successful businessman investing their life savings into fidget spinners if you did that two years ago you would pull out eight months ago and have a trillion dollars alright for a second I looked at the names and I saw edgehog and I was like what a terrible name that's my name
[257:41.27]Versus Lambar.
[257:44.51]Here we go.
[257:54.35]Never pull out of it.
[257:55.57]Yes.
[257:59.26]The Bubblegum Dinosaur is not going to have anything on evil hair, okay?
[258:07.24]This is... Good luck.
[258:09.38]Because you're going to lose.
[258:11.39]He's got all these cool punches.
[258:12.40]He's got like one, two rabbit punches and stuff.
[258:14.36]Let's see.
[258:15.72]Guru guru.
[258:16.28]Just wait till you guys see this one.
[258:19.24]Oh.
[258:19.74]But he's terrible though.
[258:21.04]We should delete him.
[258:21.96]Now I'm gonna fucking re-frog scream at him.
[258:24.10]The thing that everybody loves to say in chat.
[258:26.34]You want me to get rid of the thing that you guys love the most?
[258:30.52]This?
[258:46.47]But let's get rid of them, right?
[258:52.80]That was just my burnt CD sped up.
[259:08.20]Yeah.
[259:08.82]I love him now.
[259:09.90]He's great.
[259:10.50]Everybody loves him.
[259:12.56]All it took was you guys to hear the- Oh, I knew that's what it was gonna take for you guys to hear the funny scream.
[259:17.34]And now all of a sudden you don't want me to- We're gonna look- It's gonna grow on you, and then let's rewind to here, when everybody said, delete this fucking guy, and then when I actually try to delete him, everyone's gonna be like, No, don't!
[259:29.11]We love him!
[259:29.73]Remember when he did the funny frog scream?
[259:31.41]And then we're gonna get another chat versus streamer fight.
[259:49.85]Unstoppable.
[259:50.45]He's not even going to take any damage.
[259:54.79]What other moves do I have?
[259:57.46]I can just toy with this guy.
[259:58.48]Like a head jab.
[260:01.18]It's alright.
[260:02.10]Try it again.
[260:03.62]Cool.
[260:03.78]Ah!
[260:18.11]Leave the Rein behind.
[260:19.39]I'll pledge to the edge.
[260:21.95]I like it.
[260:22.41]I like that sentiment.
[260:31.36]He's not gonna lose one fight until C. Guaranteed.
[260:42.88]That is a 100% guarantee.
[260:44.90]If he loses one fight, I will sell him to the market.
[260:49.07]Until we get to see.
[260:55.61]He's just too good.
[261:17.69]Don't get confused.
[261:22.73]Oh shit, he's going to lose.
[261:26.95]No, why is he getting confused?
[261:28.41]I have so much will.
[261:29.36]Please let me use it.
[261:31.40]Scream at him.
[261:31.96]Scream at him.
[261:32.38]Scream at him.
[261:34.20]Scream at him.
[261:41.95]No.
[261:42.69]Back it up.
[261:45.36]Back it up.
[261:46.68]Back up.
[261:47.98]Back up.
[261:49.88]I'm gonna lose.
[261:52.41]Hit him with anything.
[261:54.13]Anything.
[261:54.57]I'm gonna lose.
[261:57.25]Lucky.
[262:00.59]That was the most... That was the luckiest thing ever.
[262:02.67]I just barely won by 1%.
[262:03.57]Yeah, we're fine.
[262:19.91]Edgehog wins.
[262:21.87]He's bad?
[262:22.51]No, he's not bad.
[262:25.27]He's awful.
[262:29.12]But we're just gonna harvest him for his organs.
[262:31.14]12 fame, that's pretty good.
[262:45.20]This game is awful?
[262:46.32]Whoa, whoa, hold on a second there.
[262:48.08]Hold on.
[262:49.76]This game is... fantastic.
[262:52.65]I feel like I'm being taunted here.
[262:58.01]That's just, like, me sneezing.
[263:03.31]Is this game recording me talking?
[263:06.21]What an egomaniac to even... even consider saying something like that, Jeremy.
[263:10.16]Alright, let's, uh...
[263:15.40]Let him rest.
[263:16.40]We're gonna pump power.
[263:26.54]This game is fucking terrible.
[263:28.02]What are you on about?
[263:33.66]This game is so much fun.
[263:36.62]It really is a lot of fun.
[263:43.27]And this is only the first one.
[263:44.33]They probably get way more complex as we go.
[263:46.52]I've never played the other ones.
[263:47.44]I only played this one when I was younger.
[263:51.92]Alright, what do we got?
[263:52.71]We have... Skill is good.
[263:54.87]We need power and probably...
[264:04.50]Power and speed.
[264:06.56]Power and defense.
[264:07.36]Let's take a look.
[264:08.50]Can't do it with training, but... Life and defense.
[264:14.39]Skill goes down.
[264:16.61]Power and life speed goes down.
[264:18.19]That sucks.
[264:27.87]Let's do power for a little bit.
[264:29.33]Play Monster Rancher 2 while I plan on it.
[264:44.45]Power, speed, and skill.
[264:48.91]Sounds like a good plan.
[264:52.21]I can't wait for Monster Rancher World.
[265:01.54]Again, power.
[265:12.49]See, right now, this is... Fuck, there's an official tournament this week.
[265:22.26]Wait, I have items, right?
[265:23.18]Can I... I gotta go buy one.
[265:28.22]What's the one to make you not tired?
[265:32.88]It's the taffy, right?
[265:38.05]Promoted to the second rank.
[265:40.80]Good luck.
[265:41.86]What do you want?
[265:42.32]Does he have more items?
[265:43.30]Let's buy a taffy.
[265:50.53]Heal fatigue.
[265:54.41]Mint is stress.
[265:55.75]Taffy is fatigue.
[265:57.87]I can do them both.
[265:59.43]Eat up.
[266:10.94]No, I don't want anything else.
[266:16.60]Uh, taffy.
[266:19.10]Why did I buy the snake?
[266:20.00]What is it even for?
[266:20.74]Eat the leaf.
[266:35.59]I'm doping right now.
[266:39.39]Schedule.
[266:40.01]Battle.
[266:40.99]Level up.
[266:41.73]Official Cup.
[266:48.78]I miss this series especially, too.
[266:50.08]It was so good.
[266:52.60]I'm surprised they didn't try to do something like this for the... next generation here.
[266:58.90]But, I mean, it would really just turn into loot boxes, wouldn't it?
[267:01.99]Nowadays?
[267:03.97]Monster Rancher 5 would end up being just paying for monsters and boxes.
[267:09.93]Because there really is no gimmick you could do anymore, like the CD gimmick is not cool anymore.
[267:17.65]How would you actually do a DNA harvesting?
[267:25.05]Everyone, we remember this guy, this guy sucks.
[267:33.86]Hard drives.
[267:36.07]Where you drag one of your folders in.
[267:42.01]QR codes, opening up files and shit.
[267:44.43]Yeah, but you know how many people would be so against that?
[267:47.39]For, you know, NSA, like, privacy concerns.
[267:50.09]Yeah, here, please take my folders from my computer.
[267:53.96]Read them.
[267:55.52]What's that?
[267:56.26]That's my tax folder.
[267:57.76]Let's see what monster we get from this.
[268:00.66]Uploading data to Capcom.
[268:19.30]Stop using the move that's not... Just... Just please fight him.
[268:23.31]And kick him in the face.
[268:24.53]Dammit.
[268:33.35]Don't you fucking lose to this loser.
[268:35.55]Don't you lose to the guy that we've never lost to.
[268:38.35]Once.
[268:41.20]Oh my fucking lord.
[268:45.83]Alright, he's dead.
[268:53.60]Good.
[268:57.68]Evil bunny.
[269:01.40]Make monsters from music files?
[269:04.15]No, they'd end up doing a thing where you... There would have to be materials that you collect in the game somehow.
[269:13.43]They'll give you a Squirtle, they'll give you a Charizard at the very beginning, and every time you beat a monster, you get two or three scraps of their DNA, and you put it into the freezer, and you would have to play the game.
[269:25.18]Kind of like Monster Hunter, where you get this monster's stuff, and you can use them in the DNA machine.
[269:31.80]I'm just describing Monster Hunter.
[269:34.10]Except instead of you, you use them as weapons, not as actual monsters.
[269:48.23]Instagram likes?
[269:58.43]Scrumptious O'Leary.
[270:00.90]Well, there's no there's no people in this game, I guess like the fairy was a person the plant vegetable fairy Always started off with the scream you can help it Guru guru That didn't do anything
[270:30.93]Wow.
[270:31.51]Holy fuck.
[270:33.07]Why am I not using that move more often?
[270:41.18]That's a ton of damage.
[270:43.20]Okay.
[270:45.44]That's his evil special move.
[270:52.20]That's how Digimon works?
[270:56.61]Maybe this game just can't live...
[271:00.79]Its whole gimmick was breeding monsters from CDs and DVDs.
[271:04.55]Once you take that away and bring it into the main stream of gaming now, it's just another monster fighting game.
[271:13.90]Digimon, Pokémon, and those games arguably do it way better.
[271:17.56]I don't know.
[271:20.71]I've never played Digimon before.
[271:23.33]But this game was fun because of the CD shit and the molding and melding monsters together.
[271:28.15]It just wouldn't survive now.
[271:38.68]Come on, punch him.
[271:44.28]The DS one was you drew pictures instead?
[271:46.73]That's interesting.
[271:48.65]But even still though, that's still kind of... like... when you draw on the screen and it turns your drawing into a string of... ...mathematic algorithms.
[271:59.27]I think it still do CDs.
[272:09.23]It'd be good to accept Blu-rays, I guess.
[272:18.30]Alright, moving on to D. We could do something with Street Pass on the DS, where you... That's actually a pretty cool idea.
[272:35.15]Coding, algorithms...
[272:41.13]standard deviation what are you talking about nobody uses street fats you just want an emulator and a Monster Rancher to rom that's why rom can't really work with this game can it
[273:06.96]How would you, how would you do the, how do you emulate putting a different CD into the tray?
[273:12.08]Can you do that on an emulator?
[273:15.07]No, no, don't give him the fish, I wanna train him.
[273:17.17]Don't, don't give him the fish.
[273:19.77]Give him the potatoes.
[273:26.91]You can?
[273:28.12]Is it a pain in the ass?
[273:28.86]I feel like that would be kind of annoying.
[273:29.88]Is he tired?
[273:34.48]Let's let him rest.
[273:35.52]Rest and then train.
[273:41.31]Get something like daemon tools or replicated disk drive.
[273:50.85]You just emulate.
[273:52.19]It's not that difficult.
[273:55.13]Well, we're gonna get to do it cheaper.
[273:56.45]Can I do it twice this month?
[273:58.21]Come on.
[273:58.75]It's the stupid item shop.
[274:05.26]No, I don't care.
[274:05.96]I want to train.
[274:14.38]Uh, let's do... What do I have first?
[274:16.84]My life needs to go up.
[274:20.24]Uh, let's do life.
[274:21.69]I can't sit here at a hundred life.
[274:23.17]That's pathetic.
[274:28.09]Get it done, come on.
[274:31.85]You are worthless.
[274:35.90]Don't make this a waste of 2,000.
[274:37.20]If you mess up more... Okay.
[274:40.24]You mess up more than one more time, and I am going to harvest your DNA right now.
[274:49.55]You got one more chance.
[275:01.75]You live another day.
[275:10.28]I would have just dunked him right into the DNA machine.
[275:16.12]Stop moving the goal post.
[275:21.18]When's the next official tournament?
[275:29.63]You know, that is still an option, you're right.
[275:32.03]Battle, let's see.
[275:35.29]Official, looking for the official cup.
[275:36.79]It's right here.
[275:38.70]So let's get him ready for the Official Cup, get him to see, because I should win.
[275:42.33]I need more health, though.
[275:45.75]My current stats are alright, but man, do I need more health.
[275:49.89]Bad.
[275:54.32]Right there.
[275:56.36]Oh my god, you are so bad.
[276:13.84]You can't do a tournament with 110 health.
[276:20.78]Thank God.
[276:22.34]Only three?
[276:23.16]That's not even worth doing.
[276:24.94]I missed Sweet Run.
[276:28.98]What happens if you go broke?
[276:38.35]I'm scared.
[276:41.99]What do I have for Intelligence?
[276:45.92]Alright, let's do intelligence once.
[276:49.46]So I can get to over 150.
[276:50.60]See, he loves those.
[276:53.52]He loves carrots.
[276:54.10]He's a rabbit.
[276:54.58]Of course he's going to do well on this.
[277:00.35]He's leveled up intelligence.
[277:02.43]Cool.
[277:10.03]Official Cup.
[277:10.79]Get to see.
[277:13.95]Scan some CDs, try to get a worm to force a rainbow.
[277:19.87]Not a bad idea.
[277:28.53]One more day.
[277:30.23]What are we desperate for?
[277:31.45]Probably power.
[277:33.81]Yeah, let's do power.
[277:37.44]Get a level 170.
[277:42.20]Opinion on Monster Rancher Evo.
[277:43.74]I've never played it.
[277:45.52]That's the last one they made, right?
[277:54.99]That's the final one, isn't it?
[277:57.97]What's the last one they made for an actual console?
[278:01.58]Monster Rancher 4?
[278:02.28]Or was it 3 on PlayStation 2?
[278:11.97]Get us to C. Four is the last one.
[278:18.95]One of them was really bad.
[278:20.29]Which one was it?
[278:23.17]When I was looking up ratings and how this game did over the years, there was one in particular that did really terribly.
[278:29.34]You played Evo and it was like having a fever dream.
[278:38.84]It was Evo.
[278:39.46]Evo was the bad, the terrible one.
[278:42.88]One of the DS was bad.
[278:50.01]Everything past 2 was bad.
[278:52.47]I thought 3 was good, but didn't people say that 3 was one of the better ones?
[278:57.25]I've heard that 1, 2, and 3 are good.
[279:02.77]And the rest are very hit or miss.
[279:09.95]Diamond and Pearl were the bad ones.
[279:15.28]If you didn't get confused, you would have got a big hit there and you just didn't listen.
[279:25.40]Come on.
[279:26.96]Back it up, back it up.
[279:28.27]Give me a good position here.
[279:29.15]Come on, more than 50%.
[279:29.71]I'm going to have to bring up the scream, I think.
[279:39.15]I have so much will, I can't even spend it.
[279:48.19]Do it again.
[279:51.89]Big kick.
[279:57.42]Dead.
[280:00.68]All the main four are fairly good, to be honest.
[280:07.03]Cool.
[280:07.41]There was a Monster Rancher TV show, wasn't there?
[280:15.42]You can train five monsters at once in four, that's cool.
[280:19.68]So let me ask you this, for those of you that know the series really well.
[280:24.35]Is the difference between 1 and 2 that great where it would be worth getting Monster Rancher 2 and playing it?
[280:32.67]Or are 1 and 2 very much the same and go get 3 and play that on PlayStation 2 because that's like the newer shit and newer stuff.
[280:42.63]I guess what I'm saying is, is it worth me streaming Monster Rancher 2 when we've played Monster Rancher 1 for as long as we have?
[280:51.04]Yes, it is.
[280:51.46]2 is so good.
[280:52.80]Okay.
[280:55.22]So we should just go in a row here.
[280:58.01]Eventually.
[280:59.63]Skip to 4.
[281:00.57]Play 3.
[281:01.13]2 is better.
[281:01.81]2 is fucking nutty.
[281:06.37]Because Monster Ranch 2 is on PlayStation 1, isn't it?
[281:09.52]They're both on the same console.
[281:10.94]Just don't know if there was that much of a huge difference between the two.
[281:15.88]And it's good to know that there is.
[281:21.79]Scream at him.
[281:23.67]Just to get him off guard a little bit.
[281:29.61]You know, that's never not going to be funny.
[281:30.81]I'm sorry.
[281:40.46]This is going to be close.
[281:49.15]Bang.
[281:49.85]Oh, what 99%?
[281:50.31]Why does that keep happening to me?
[281:51.55]Alright, break it up, break it up.
[282:01.31]Move back.
[282:01.69]Back, back, back.
[282:02.29]Break it up.
[282:11.56]I still win.
[282:11.94]How are you realistically expected to beat this in real life?
[282:25.71]You mean the game?
[282:28.33]It's no different than anything else.
[282:29.49]I mean, you keep making new monsters, you combine them, you bring them down to level zero, you know, it's how old they are, do the same thing, get them higher stats, bring them over, recalibrate them, put their DNA into a new monster, bring that person down to zero years old, it's just a series of going back to zero.
[282:50.42]It's still a lot of fun, though.
[282:59.47]Use your special.
[283:02.57]That's the big uppercut, right?
[283:04.31]It's hard to hit it.
[283:10.11]Monsters can die of old age, yes.
[283:12.23]And they can die in fights, too.
[283:17.17]We're not harvesting them now.
[283:25.31]Right after that.
[283:25.75]Two in a row.
[283:26.13]Come on.
[283:33.38]Mmm.
[283:34.00]Gee, yeah, spend all your will.
[283:35.20]That's fine.
[283:43.96]One more hit, and I win.
[283:46.24]Oh, I just got... I got really cocky there.
[283:49.46]Sorry, he still loses.
[283:51.02]Hmm.
[283:54.46]You have the will to live.
[283:56.22]I'll give you that.
[283:58.22]It's not gonna be enough.
[284:09.61]So if you're only generation 50 passing down genes and your monster dies, are you just screwed?
[284:16.51]Yeah, I'm gonna say yes.
[284:20.53]But you would probably have a save point that was well within your period where you would need to change.
[284:26.24]This is gonna be the real test.
[284:31.88]Because big rock guy versus little... This is just David and Goliath.
[284:37.22]I don't understand how David wins in that fight anyways.
[284:41.39]I don't understand how Shadow the Colossus you can beat all those colossi.
[284:46.30]It doesn't make any sense.
[284:48.28]The huge guy with the most power always wins.
[284:50.70]The little guy that can move fast, it doesn't matter if you just cause an earthquake around him, he's dead.
[284:55.96]It's pretty unrealistic.
[285:00.52]This guy's made out of rocks.
[285:03.02]Why would I be able to hurt him?
[285:12.34]Damn it.
[285:12.82]I really... That was... I blew it all.
[285:14.92]That was me going for the gold right there.
[285:16.86]And I'm in trouble.
[285:28.68]Back it up.
[285:29.22]No!
[285:31.96]One of those is going to do a ton of damage to me.
[285:39.70]Like that.
[285:45.36]Nooo!
[285:46.04]This is gonna be over.
[285:46.82]That's it.
[285:49.11]See?
[285:49.47]Goliath always wins.
[285:50.73]I just can't do enough damage to him and he gets one random fucking huge hit on a tiny percentage.
[286:03.54]You have to harvest him now.
[286:15.84]What do you mean, what do you mean I suck?
[286:19.16]We're both rolling dice at each other.
[286:20.74]It's just, he was rolling dice, and when he, his 30% hits, he does like 70 damage to me.
[286:35.39]I don't win that fight.
[286:38.21]Do you ever read the Bible?
[286:42.97]Goliath destroys the whole town.
[286:45.97]David throws a rock at him and it like bounces off of his chest.
[286:48.95]He laughs and he squishes him with his hand.
[286:52.09]It's fucking insane.
[287:02.92]That percentage is so bad.
[287:04.20]I need to stop even doing it in the first place.
[287:18.42]I'm getting so badly screwed here.
[287:20.84]This is not good.
[287:34.33]Can I please hit something?
[287:37.03]Oh my god, why?
[287:42.96]Just scream at him over and over again.
[287:49.13]Honestly, I can't- I can't hit him with anything.
[287:57.82]Guru's at 37- Guru- I got lost.
[288:01.78]He's gone.
[288:03.00]He's dead.
[288:03.58]It's over.
[288:04.18]He's dead.
[288:09.55]The Guru Guru was gonna be the same percentage and it was gonna take way more power, way more will to do.
[288:16.72]This character sucks.
[288:18.68]He's done.
[288:19.84]Goodbye.
[288:20.76]Instantly removing him.
[288:41.11]Give him encouragement because he's about to be fused into somebody else.
[288:54.08]I never lost a tournament with the other guy I was playing with.
[289:00.34]Let's go.
[289:01.02]Come to town.
[289:01.64]Hey, come on to town.
[289:03.61]Yeah, we're going into town.
[289:04.67]We're going to go get you some candy.
[289:06.03]We're going to go to your favorite restaurant.
[289:13.93]Don't you like this place?
[289:15.83]Get in there!
[289:21.51]Alright, let me see something here.
[289:24.31]I don't have enough money to do this.
[289:34.33]I'm pulling out.
[289:35.99]Louise.
[289:40.34]Let's give it a go.
[289:52.12]It was the Easter Bunny.
[289:56.85]Let's take this guy back.
[289:58.89]Get some money.
[290:02.35]How long have I been streaming for?
[290:03.41]Five hours?
[290:08.30]40 intelligence.
[290:09.12]That's alright.
[290:09.68]These guys aren't smart.
[290:14.90]Ivan Ooze.
[290:17.94]Should've stuck with the 8% monster.
[290:19.44]I can't rewind at this point, man.
[290:28.10]I wanna see what this guy can do.
[290:29.08]I'm curious.
[290:39.79]I just killed another iconic holiday character.
[290:46.83]Let's see, you got really good power, really good skill already.
[290:52.64]Groin punch?
[290:54.04]Belly punch, flick, and then stub.
[291:01.13]Kind of underwhelming, actually.
[291:04.17]D damage, D damage, D damage.
[291:06.45]These are terrible.
[291:07.23]Huh.
[291:13.11]This guy's not good.
[291:13.88]I mean, I guess it's only 10.
[291:16.26]It takes 10 will to do these moves.
[291:20.30]They're really cheap, but they suck.
[291:35.51]Alright, let's send him to work.
[291:36.53]Let's just make some money.
[291:43.19]We get to see his new cool animation.
[291:47.09]He's doing a really good job, actually.
[291:49.88]Do it again.
[292:00.48]Work.
[292:03.97]Let's do the same thing, powering life.
[292:06.25]What?
[292:06.63]No, he's just going to sleep.
[292:14.02]No.
[292:15.00]This guy's just DNA bait anyways, so who cares?
[292:20.32]Loaf or rind?
[292:26.01]I don't like the way this guy walks either.
[292:27.51]He reminds me of the Worgen from World of Warcraft.
[292:30.41]Just so goofy looking when he moves around.
[292:37.89]This is the only job you have to do.
[292:39.23]It's really, really good.
[292:41.13]You just stretch out your stretch arm, strong arms.
[292:45.32]You can't lose this one.
[292:46.98]Alright.
[292:49.36]So.
[292:49.56]Let's go to town.
[292:52.50]I have enough money.
[292:54.54]I don't want to... This guy... I don't like the moves.
[292:57.85]They're cheap.
[293:00.31]They don't really do any damage.
[293:01.49]I'm sure after a while you level up.
[293:03.37]We thought this guy was so cool.
[293:05.84]No, it's just a dude in a Halloween costume.
[293:08.76]He sucks.
[293:11.96]Freeze him.
[293:18.70]Alright, let's put another CD in here.
[293:22.36]I'm gonna probably stop streaming here in a little bit.
[293:26.23]Let's put in...
[293:32.05]There's so many games and so many DVDs and shit down here.
[293:36.85]Alright, what about, okay, what's SEGA CD, right?
[293:38.63]What about Wirehead?
[293:42.00]Let's put in Wirehead.
[293:45.44]Oh, no, here's what I got.
[293:46.68]I got Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the SEGA CD video game.
[293:53.42]Let's do it.
[293:59.99]I really like this game.
[294:01.07]I'm having a ton of fun.
[294:02.89]I might stream this game again.
[294:04.23]I'm gonna make sure... I'm gonna go buy all the Monster Ranchers.
[294:08.68]I'm gonna be a Monster Rancher streamer forever.
[294:12.64]None of that's true, but... You know, maybe temporarily.
[294:20.37]I shit you not, I really am enjoying this whole experience.
[294:23.61]It's fun.
[294:30.18]I don't know if it can read the Power Rangers CD.
[294:36.14]It's having trouble.
[294:39.82]Can you hear it?
[294:41.80]It's just... It's not doing it.
[294:55.81]It can't read it.
[294:57.05]It's too scuffed up.
[294:58.09]Alright, what about...
[295:01.83]Where's the wire head?
[295:07.17]Now, remember that terrible butterfly game on the SEGA CD?
[295:09.39]We'll try that one.
[295:11.49]Double switch.
[295:12.79]No, no.
[295:13.07]Is that the... No, that's not the butterfly one.
[295:14.38]That's the one where you drop people down the... Here it comes.
[295:27.95]There we go.
[295:28.45]Alright.
[295:29.89]Let's see what we get from Double Switch, the SEGA CD video game.
[295:36.23]It's going to be such a nightmare to clean all this up.
[295:38.59]I just, I'm taking out discs and not putting them back, taking out discs, taking out discs, putting on the table in front of me, flipping it around, putting out discs.
[295:48.40]It's going to be, I'm going to have to hire a service to come and do this.
[295:57.85]Give me something cool so I can combine with the bunny.
[296:00.07]And we can actually get a cool monster.
[296:03.23]Not the dumbest, shittiest, edgelord bunny.
[296:07.65]That really took the wind out of the sails.
[296:13.82]Something cool, come on.
[296:17.08]It's the same exact Rex that I have.
[296:21.34]It's just a green T-Rex.
[296:22.72]I already have one of these.
[296:29.57]Can I throw him away immediately?
[296:30.81]He doesn't get a name.
[296:49.94]Just pretend like you didn't even see him.
[296:51.88]Because he's gone.
[296:56.34]Alright, let's do...
[297:06.06]This is the Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch Make My Music Video CD.
[297:10.18]Let's see what we get from this.
[297:26.06]Once we get a decent one and we combine, then that's what I'm gonna probably call the stream for today.
[297:35.82]So while there's still people here, we're not going to have everyone trickle out near the end of the stream here.
[297:41.62]Tomorrow.
[297:42.73]Hey, guess what happens tomorrow?
[297:44.09]It's going to be great.
[297:46.25]New England, Massachusetts is getting hit with another awful storm.
[297:51.43]All my power just came back.
[297:54.14]I haven't had it for a few days now.
[297:55.80]Just got it back in the last 24 hours.
[297:58.40]Sweet.
[297:58.92]Awesome.
[297:59.26]That's fantastic.
[298:01.04]It might go out again for like another week.
[298:05.36]So hopefully that doesn't happen, but if it does, obviously I have my cell phone so I can tell you guys if... Hey, power's out again.
[298:18.23]Hope it doesn't happen, but it might.
[298:19.29]I just want to make sure that you're aware that it's possible.
[298:24.79]Now let's see what Marky Mark has generated for us.
[298:30.90]Something good.
[298:33.54]It's a new sponge.
[298:36.21]It's the same sponge we had before.
[298:37.58]It's D-Sponge.
[298:38.22]It's back.
[298:43.26]It's just a solid block.
[298:48.14]Mono.
[298:53.88]Another Monolith.
[298:55.06]Just a standard Monolith.
[299:06.29]Can I get it all the way in?
[299:09.23]Come on.
[299:14.92]Yep, I can.
[299:24.86]D. Sponge is back.
[299:26.96]That's the name.
[299:27.58]D. Sponge is back!
[299:34.32]Okay, let's do one more.
[299:41.60]What's in this one?
[299:48.70]We're gonna do this.
[299:57.35]Is this an FBI game?
[300:00.07]This is called FBI Hostage Rescue.
[300:02.59]Oh yeah, I tried to install this.
[300:03.59]It didn't work.
[300:04.37]Try this one.
[300:12.70]Last one we're gonna do.
[300:13.40]This is it.
[300:14.00]Final one.
[300:20.09]FBI Hostage Rescue for the Play C computer CD-ROM.
[300:35.27]You had a C grade monster, now you only have E monsters.
[300:37.75]You've thrown away your progress.
[300:38.97]Not true.
[300:41.29]Because the monster that I had combined with the other monsters made their base stats better.
[300:52.53]If I'm wrong, please correct me, somebody.
[300:54.33]I don't think I am, though.
[301:03.60]Rewind to the rhyme.
[301:05.06]Now, this is it.
[301:10.66]Why doesn't your computer have two CD trailers?
[301:12.49]I'm using a- I'm using a PlayStation.
[301:15.81]And it's the ori- We're ending the stream with our original creation.
[301:21.15]It's the worm.
[301:21.85]Splish-O's back.
[301:26.78]Is that wrong?
[301:31.58]Is that- Is that wrong?
[301:34.55]Their stats don't carry over to make better base stats.
[301:36.89]It's just whatever the monster is.
[301:38.25]Splishio Jr.
[302:04.55]Space J-R.
[302:05.29]Yes, I can do it.
[302:12.99]So let's see if we combine here.
[302:14.91]Let's take a look.
[302:24.62]Combine.
[302:25.92]Fire and a gold.
[302:27.92]First monster.
[302:28.64]Let's see.
[302:29.02]We got Edgehog.
[302:32.62]Save the game.
[302:33.22]Yes, I will save.
[302:39.06]Meatloaf Jr.
[302:39.88]Let's see.
[302:49.69]Here we go.
[302:53.65]We got Edgehog.
[302:55.65]And let's just see what happens with the D-Sponge's back, baby.
[303:01.12]Okay, this is the worst.
[303:02.96]You're either going to get a default mono, the same thing you already have, or the dumb cow chocolate milk.
[303:09.51]No.
[303:11.41]Don't want to do it.
[303:11.93]A nice combination.
[303:14.41]Fuck off.
[303:14.85]Let's try this.
[303:21.00]And... Splishio Jr.?
[303:26.28]Okay, we get Groucho, Caron, Sobo, or Polwarm.
[303:36.88]Sobo is Meatloaf.
[303:42.80]Nah, I don't like these.
[303:49.29]Uh, let's see.
[303:52.55]Edgehog and... These are all bad.
[303:54.93]What can you be?
[304:00.77]Blue Fur Clay, Ice Candy, or Lava.
[304:05.43]Dinosaur?
[304:13.00]Sweet rind.
[304:15.13]Jax Rex.
[304:16.03]Okay, we could Scalar, Spot, Jura Wall, or Black Rex.
[304:20.81]No, these are all... I don't know what these... I'm gonna end the stream exactly where we started.
[304:31.85]No.
[304:33.07]Um, what about this?
[304:35.42]This weirdo, right?
[304:38.08]Combined with the... with the Edgehog.
[304:41.15]Alright, this is where things are getting a little interesting here.
[304:42.97]Cross-Eye, Woody, Rover, Bloodshot, Sandy, or Pulsar?
[304:54.74]No.
[304:56.60]It's a nice combination.
[304:57.55]Alright, what about... No, no, no, not you.
[305:04.73]Did we even look at this?
[305:05.79]What do these two do?
[305:07.95]Fly Guy, Eye Guy, or Yakuto... Fly Guy or Eye Guy?
[305:13.78]Fly... Hold on.
[305:14.94]Fly Eye Eye Guy.
[305:19.40]Eye Guy?
[305:27.41]I kind of want Eye Guy.
[305:28.85]Let's do it.
[305:36.16]If we get Eye Guy, then we have to keep him for a little while.
[305:42.94]That's Fly Eye.
[305:48.15]Well, he's going to be used for something else.
[305:54.25]What are his stats?
[306:05.15]They're not terrible.
[306:10.87]Fly-eye.
[306:12.97]Combine.
[306:13.60]Fuck!
[306:13.98]I don't have any money!
[306:22.28]Did I save it?
[306:23.40]I saved it, right?
[306:27.30]Did I save it?
[306:32.13]I did.
[306:32.57]Okay.
[306:32.81]I just had a... Same.
[306:35.23]I almost lost an hour of progress there.
[306:39.72]I did.
[306:40.04]Good.
[306:50.42]You saved after wormy.
[306:51.36]Okay.
[306:53.92]Rewind.
[306:54.32]Rewind.
[306:59.03]Progress?
[307:00.19]Progress is just this.
[307:01.41]We're just having fun.
[307:03.87]I got to C. I took a C monster and I combined it with a shit monster and we ended up here.
[307:12.96]With our terrible evil bunny.
[307:22.33]Edge and Luis.
[307:23.19]Let's try that.
[307:29.48]That's what I wanted to do.
[307:30.44]Edge and then Luis.
[307:36.60]Should give us... Okay.
[307:37.58]Amethyst.
[307:39.75]Edgy.
[307:42.79]We're not... Guys, we're not gonna go from Edge Hog to Edgy.
[308:07.44]It's a 32% chance.
[308:07.96]Let's see what happens.
[308:19.97]No, I don't want a snake.
[308:24.16]A bad combination.
[308:30.40]Look, the thing that I don't want the most is what I'm going to end up getting.
[308:35.95]There he is.
[308:38.37]No, there's Amethyst.
[308:41.54]I don't want a rabbit.
[308:48.06]Holy shit!
[308:57.37]Wait a minute, hold on a second here.
[309:00.15]That's 245 skill.
[309:00.75]At base level.
[309:10.21]Okay, let's not do anything hasty.
[309:15.43]And now his name is A. Put him on ice for a minute here.
[309:29.22]No, I don't... I can't combine.
[309:33.88]I don't have any money.
[309:37.83]A for a great boy.
[309:42.38]Let's check his moves.
[309:50.91]He does the same scream, spin kick, one-two punch, and head jab.
[309:54.51]He doesn't have the guru guru.
[310:00.25]But that skill, that's just so much for base level.
[310:05.42]You could get that skill up to like 350 by the time he's like at C level.
[310:14.95]I'm conflicted.
[310:15.49]I don't know.
[310:15.75]Because I hate that the rabbit's so boring.
[310:17.67]It's just a purple rabbit.
[310:18.89]Who cares?
[310:19.65]It's not anything cool.
[310:20.51]Get me out of this.
[310:30.78]Let's just... I'm going to use him.
[310:32.44]His moves are bad, but... We need to use him for a little while just so I can make money.
[310:50.61]Purple is rare.
[310:56.24]We know how to get it.
[310:56.86]We can reload and do other combos.
[310:59.64]Yeah, but it's kind of more fun to just let it happen the way that it is.
[311:03.27]Because this is an old system and you can just game the PlayStation 1 to get whatever you want.
[311:18.11]But I'm going to call it here.
[311:19.49]I've been going for over five hours.
[311:21.13]I'm going to save it.
[311:24.31]We're going to save it here.
[311:27.99]Because... Maybe I can do a new save file.
[311:35.55]It's here.
[311:42.87]Yeah, that's gonna be it.
[311:43.91]We're gonna be five more hours.
[311:45.65]Nah, it's like midnight.
[311:52.14]Fuck you, I came to watch Purple Bunny's fucking fight.
[311:59.52]Don't worry, you'll see more of this.
[312:01.86]Let's talk about this first, though.
[312:03.18]I'm gonna mute this so we can get out of here.
[312:05.19]Let me put this down.
[312:11.78]plug this back in so I can hear what you guys are saying what so I can hear what you guys are saying that doesn't make any sense I'm losing my Marvel um so let me ask you this those of you guys that have been here that have been watching the last you know I'd say what 10 hours of Monster Rancher one would you rather me continue to play the first one for a little while maybe for like another stream
[312:43.20]And then move on to the second game?
[312:44.88]Or do you think that we should just move on to the second game?
[312:47.00]What do you think?
[312:53.16]Just stay on this one until we get to at least another... Play the first one.
[312:58.20]Continue.
[312:59.06]Or do two.
[313:02.29]I'll make a poll.
[313:03.37]Here's what we're going to do.
[313:04.23]We're going to either do one more stream on Monster Rancher 1.
[313:07.19]Or we're going to move on to Monster Rancher 2.
[313:12.18]Let me just put a poll up here.
[313:13.60]Because I am just, I'm curious about what most of you guys, or at least a majority would actually want to see.
[313:20.96]Because there's a lot of content in this game.
[313:25.15]But it's content we've kind of already seen.
[313:28.29]And I am having a ton of fun.
[313:29.91]I want to keep playing this one.
[313:31.75]But if there's more content to see in the later versions, we'll see.
[313:36.15]I don't know.
[313:36.91]I like this one though.
[313:38.69]Make the poll right now.
[313:41.82]But thanks for joining.
[313:43.32]Thanks for joining us.
[313:44.16]Thanks for joining me over the last five or so hours.
[313:48.55]Hope you're having a good day.
[313:51.49]Or as they say, right?
[313:53.53]If you just stuck around for the stream, we're going to do bits and talk and hang out for a little while.
[313:58.43]Thank you for coming up.
[313:59.43]Thanks for showing up.
[314:00.77]And I'll see you next time.
[314:01.51]Thanks a lot for coming.
[314:02.87]Ta-ta.
[314:04.26]But for the rest of you, answer this poll.
[314:06.66]MonsterRancher.
[314:11.08]one more stream of one move on to two here you go for my own curiosity let me know what you guys want to see because I'm down for either one if my power dies
[314:39.66]I don't know when the next stream is going to be, but I'll make them up.
[314:43.56]Right?
[314:43.74]So if I can't stream on Thursday or Friday because of power issues or storm issues, then just assume that Saturday, Sunday, Monday, we'll try to go two, three days in a row.
[314:55.41]Does 2 still have the CD gimmick?
[314:56.83]Yes, it does.
[314:59.19]All of them have the CD gimmick.
[315:01.43]In fact, when you get to 3, that's on PlayStation 2.
[315:06.64]It actually allows DVDs as well.
[315:16.62]Oh, by the way, this is not happening immediately.
[315:23.07]I cannot stream a DS anyway, so I wouldn't be playing them.
[315:25.85]This is not going to happen on Thursday, because obviously I need to buy the game and have it shipped to me.
[315:32.55]So, it looks like most people want to move on to 2.
[315:38.17]Will I play 3?
[315:38.91]Absolutely.
[315:40.76]So, let's just say that I don't cancel any streams because of the storm.
[315:46.31]Monster Rancher 2 would probably end up being like next week because obviously I can't do it immediately.
[315:55.65]What happened to Dreamcast?
[315:58.66]Sitting right here.
[316:01.20]I have a PlayStation 2 and have a Dreamcast sitting right next to me.
[316:05.88]In due time.
[316:06.50]We're trying to get through all the old cool shit, right?
[316:10.76]And I do want to give it the time that it deserves.
[316:15.72]So, it looks like we're gonna do two.
[316:18.09]What are you voting for?
[316:20.83]Oh, for someone that has... You're voting to see, do you want me to continue to play Monster Rancher 1, or do you want me to move on to Monster Rancher 2?
[316:34.68]What was the point of the poll?
[316:35.50]What do you mean?
[316:39.12]Well, the poll... I mean, I wouldn't be playing Monster Rancher 1 on my next stream.
[316:45.78]What would you play on Thursday?
[316:46.68]I would probably do something else.
[316:49.04]I never like to do, like, three streams in a row of the same game.
[316:52.30]I like to mix it up a little bit.
[316:56.54]It's just the next time you see Monster Rancher, which version do you want to see on that poll?
[317:05.67]Where's the never play this series again option?
[317:08.31]Come on, Reaper.
[317:09.39]This is a fun game.
[317:14.06]This game's great.
[317:14.96]It's a classic.
[317:15.90]This game changed the world.
[317:18.26]Alright, let's move over here.
[317:26.48]Let's get through.
[317:27.57]It looks like we're going to move on to two next week.
[317:31.81]But, hey.
[317:33.43]Everybody.
[317:35.19]Thanks for coming to the stream.

[321:30.12]Thank you.
[321:33.28]Now let's move on to the bits.
[321:39.54]Hey, let's start back here.
[321:43.04]Back a while ago.
[321:44.00]This is a long stream.
[321:45.26]We've got a lot of bits to go through.
[321:46.68]Let's just chill and hang out for a little while.
[321:50.59]Thank you Asha108 for the ten bucks.
[321:55.01]Asha says, uh, if I give bits, will your internet stay alive?
[322:00.06]Probably not, unfortunately.
[322:02.18]Thank you for the ten dollars, though.
[322:06.34]I wish there was a magic button I could press to make it so the internet never turned off.
[322:09.36]Oh, my power.
[322:11.22]It sucks, because speaking of power, I just went grocery shopping.
[322:15.34]Not even a day before the power went out.
[322:17.68]All that food has to go in the trash.
[322:19.04]It was the most painful experience.
[322:21.53]Just opening the container, dropping in brand new meats that you just didn't even open out of a package and you have to throw in the trash.
[322:32.48]Awful.
[322:36.96]But thank you, Asha, for the 10 bucks.
[322:38.88]Appreciate it.
[322:41.90]Soup or seal, thank you for the 50 cents.
[322:45.32]And yeah, you can put stuff on ice, and you do that, but there's only so much room you've got in a cooler to have a bunch of bags of ice, and you don't even know how long you're gonna need it for, you have to keep changing the ice out, it was... No.
[323:02.22]No bueno.
[323:04.34]Uh, thanks to those who pursued over the 50 cents.
[323:05.82]People in chat have been waiting, or wanting you to watch this video.
[323:10.23]Yeah, we already talked about that.
[323:11.28]That was like the globulo snake man.
[323:14.62]Yeah, I've seen it.
[323:15.60]We talked about it.
[323:18.94]I'm the globulo gabgalab.
[323:20.98]I love books.
[323:22.66]And this basement is a true treasure trove.
[323:26.18]Mm-hmm.
[323:31.63]Yeah, it's just a really weird video.
[323:33.51]Yeah, the...
[323:40.59]It's a guy that, like, went into Maya for, like, an hour and dragged a bunch of sliders around.
[323:49.33]But, thank you.
[323:49.93]Yes, I have seen it.
[323:51.43]Uh, Dunkey Arison, thanks for the $5.
[323:54.18]Or, Dunkey Horizon.
[323:57.52]Arisen.
[323:58.78]Jeremiah, me and my buds need you to check out a YouTube video called The Gible Glove... Alright, thanks for the $5.
[324:05.52]Appreciate it.
[324:07.08]Thanks for the $5.
[324:08.42]Monty the Moose, thanks for the $1.
[324:09.24]Hi.

[324:29.55]over 14 years straight from 1973 to 1988.
[324:30.45]That's kind of insane.
[324:37.63]Thank you for the little tidbit of information there.
[324:40.23]Sticks, as always.
[324:42.73]Forseti, thanks for the $1.
[324:44.33]I fucking love Jeremy.
[324:47.81]Hey, thanks.
[324:48.19]I appreciate that.
[324:51.16]Of course, from earlier, $100 from Polo Juice.
[324:54.70]Again, Polo Juice.
[324:56.88]Huge, huge cash drop.
[325:00.12]It's a ton of fucking money.
[325:01.00]Thank you so much.
[325:03.10]I wish there was more ways I could say thank you, but...
[325:06.62]Thank you.
[325:08.28]For that.
[325:09.56]Appreciate it.
[325:14.94]That's a lot of money.
[325:19.52]Yes!
[325:21.96]This is a very good game.
[325:23.48]I'm happy that most of you guys... ...agree.
[325:28.77]If you have access to a PlayStation 1, or... ...even if you don't, if you emulate it... ...just don't tell anybody about it, you know?
[325:37.70]If you're going to emulate a game like this, don't tell your friends about it.
[325:44.92]Somebody gets wind of that and they hear about it, you're stealing.
[325:49.81]From a company that may not even exist anymore.
[325:57.11]How dare you.
[326:01.23]Now, emulation's weird, because isn't it... Isn't there a law on the books that says, like, if you bought the game and you own the disk, then emulation is legal?
[326:14.85]Because it's technically a digital copy of the game, or if you make the ROM yourself or something, right?
[326:23.10]There's a weird bunch of weird legality there.
[326:24.76]There's a huge gray area.
[326:29.60]Yeah.
[326:30.22]Yeah.
[326:31.69]Well, there you go.
[326:33.49]I'm sure you... Wait a minute.
[326:35.15]Hold on a second.
[326:35.69]Have you ever bought Monster Rancher?
[326:37.41]I've probably bought this game like three times.
[326:38.85]I think so.
[326:42.67]Something like that.
[326:43.19]But whatever.
[326:45.25]It's a great game to experience.
[326:47.27]If you have an old PlayStation 1 lying around and you get an actual physical version, it's... You know, obviously... There's that route to take.
[326:58.07]But yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[326:59.75]I encourage you to have fun in these games.
[327:04.87]Because that's what they're there for.
[327:07.69]Thank you to Training Book for the $1.
[327:11.14]Volume and Scrumpus.
[327:13.70]No, both of those are gone.
[327:15.30]Volume's deleted, right?
[327:17.60]Maybe.
[327:18.02]Sam!
[327:18.48]Thanks for the two bucks, Sam, man.
[327:19.70]If you dress up like a cowboy, are you ranch dressing?
[327:25.27]I'm gonna just answer this.
[327:26.13]Seems like a yes or no question.
[327:28.41]Regardless of the joke.
[327:30.61]Yes.
[327:32.93]Thank you Anthony 1215 for the one dollar.
[327:35.01]Don't listen to what they say.
[327:36.01]Your hair is perfect.
[327:37.69]You didn't even see the back of my hair.
[327:41.03]I am growing an involuntary rat tail.
[327:45.03]And no, I'm not gonna show you.
[327:46.33]Because that's an image I don't want to ever be shown on the internet.
[327:50.17]I don't ever want to see that image on the internet ever again.
[327:53.61]No.
[327:56.37]Thank you.
[327:57.59]Thank you Alfred Artie for the 15 bucks Hey Germany, if we do some fan art of some of your characters, where can we send it to you so you can see it Twitter?
[328:07.55]Just at me on Twitter
[328:10.47]I check Twitter maybe, like, once or twice a day.
[328:13.57]Sometimes I'm a little bit slow on it, sometimes I check it, like, once every other day, once every couple days.
[328:18.15]I don't do the social media thing, I just don't.
[328:21.16]So many people just do it, and they, like, that's all they do, and they get it, like, uh... Especially, like, in the streamer and YouTuber realm, they're fucking on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, constantly, like, I don't do the social media thing.
[328:33.81]I'm fucking old.
[328:40.80]But I do check.
[328:41.38]I do see what people are saying.
[328:44.38]As much as I don't participate all the time, I do read.
[328:47.90]Sorry, we touched a nerve there.
[328:51.56]No.
[328:53.84]No.
[328:55.40]I'm just saying, I don't really do the social media thing.
[329:07.35]Old man.
[329:08.19]You never had social media.
[329:09.03]You don't regret it.
[329:11.45]I mean, I can see the value in it, I just don't, I can't... I talk way too much, and 140 characters, 200, even 280 characters is not enough.
[329:21.09]If I have something I want to tell you guys, I've tried to make tweets, and it just goes on, and I can't stop.
[329:27.25]And then it gets to like 500 characters, and you have to start deleting words.
[329:32.20]And how can I say that full sentence in three words?
[329:36.10]Hmm.
[329:37.04]Okay, take out all the conjunctions.
[329:38.82]Take out all the consonants.
[329:40.66]Only use vowels.
[329:42.56]No, hold on.
[329:43.86]Take out the periods.
[329:44.88]Take out the... No, I don't do that.
[329:48.66]I don't want to condense my thoughts down, I want to explode them.
[329:52.97]All over your screen, you know?
[329:54.41]I want to just show you everything I got.
[329:57.55]I don't want to speak in like three-letter words to get my point across.
[330:10.46]Twitter's fun for random dumb things.
[330:12.88]And obviously for announcements too, like for me when I'm streaming.
[330:15.70]It's a really easy way for people that aren't either currently following or they're not... I don't even... Twitch is weird, right?
[330:22.79]Like notifications sometimes don't go through.
[330:26.47]And sometimes maybe you're not on your phone, you're on the computer and you're looking at Twitter.
[330:29.81]Oh, okay.
[330:30.29]Like maybe that's how you see where I'm streaming.
[330:32.18]It's a place for me to do like announcements.
[330:35.14]It's easier that way.
[330:44.37]Siphon Filter.
[330:44.99]There's three Siphon Filters if you want suggestions.
[330:46.79]Yeah, I actually was gonna get Siphon Filter, but... No, I think we're done with PlayStation 1 after this.
[330:52.90]After Monster Rancher 2, PlayStation 1 is done.
[330:55.62]Well, I have Dino Crisis.
[330:58.70]I'll throw in a Dino Crisis, like, 30-minute stream somewhere.
[331:01.46]We can laugh at the T-Rex, and then that's it, and turn the game off.
[331:04.32]That's a classic as well.
[331:07.14]A bit.
[331:07.44]What are we doing?
[331:07.98]Okay.
[331:09.24]Um...
[331:11.18]Thank you, but thank you to Alfred already for the 15 bucks.
[331:14.68]Twitter, just at me.
[331:16.88]RD Elite, thanks for the $5.
[331:19.84]You match the description of Farquaad, the hair, the height, and the expelling of memes on the channel.
[331:26.50]And John Lithgow actually is one of my favorite actors.
[331:29.98]So, that's kind of a tough, that's a tough one for me.
[331:34.38]John Lithgow is great.
[331:36.80]So, I don't know, take that as you will.
[331:40.61]Hydro725, thanks for the $1.
[331:42.23]Even with the hair, you could not cosplay Farquaad as he's quite taller than you.
[331:46.37]You went in a different direction with that one.
[331:47.96]Okay.
[331:48.48]Thanks for the $1.
[331:51.06]Thank you to Training Book for the $1.
[331:53.06]Scrumpus.
[331:54.16]Yes, I agree.
[331:56.28]Thank you to Tell Naga for the $0.35.
[331:58.58]Meatloaf.
[332:02.42]Yes.
[332:04.80]No longer with us, unfortunately.
[332:06.74]Quigsy, thanks for the $15.
[332:09.42]Never feed your monster vitamin, pill, steroid, or taffy.
[332:12.70]They'll shave off about five years of their life.
[332:18.28]Uh, I fed my monster that like five times.
[332:23.07]Is that true?
[332:23.63]I hope that's not true, but thanks for the $15, dude.
[332:31.03]Uh, Ryu... Ryu's streams... Ryu's suit...
[332:39.05]Streams.
[332:40.09]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[332:40.91]I'm gonna- I'm butchering your name.
[332:41.95]I'm sorry.
[332:43.35]Spending ten dollars to tell you when you're next to a monster during a fight, you can press a button to shove them the other way.
[332:49.42]Yeah, that's square.
[332:51.04]Took me a fight or two to figure that out, but thanks.
[332:52.80]Appreciate it, Ryu.
[332:57.62]History1970s thanks for the one dollar.
[332:59.90]Tell rawmeatloaf that I love him and don't listen to chat's mean words.
[333:06.99]He's dead.
[333:09.31]Thank you in Adam for the $1.
[333:10.97]Local alchemist performs ungodly experimentation on his pets.
[333:14.49]Live on stream in order to make a tasty dinner.
[333:17.80]We're not eating these people.
[333:20.94]We're combining them to be fighters and Pokemons.
[333:25.12]I don't eat the monsters I make.
[333:27.80]We breed them.
[333:29.52]It is Monster Rancher.
[333:31.29]You know?
[333:33.03]Thank you Hasnain for the $1.
[333:34.81]Put them down, please.
[333:36.25]Talking about meatloaf.
[333:38.74]I am not, thanks for the $1.
[333:40.18]Some guys say if you give him jobs with his best stat, he can do them better, or he can do them.
[333:49.60]So if you do, so if you take the best stat and do jobs at, you get more stats, I'm gonna assume.
[333:56.96]Thank you, I am not, for the $1, for the tidbit of information.
[334:01.77]DeMilk, master, thanks for the $1.
[334:02.81]Are you going to play the remastered edition of Dark Souls when it comes out, or Garfield's card?
[334:06.77]That's the sixth time he's asked this.
[334:10.48]No to that six times no.
[334:13.26]Am I going to play the remastered?
[334:14.40]Yes, I am.
[334:15.72]Whatever platform that comes out on that's easiest for me to connect to and stream, we will play the original Dark Souls one with the remaster.
[334:25.48]Yes.
[334:26.22]Promise.
[334:26.54]I'm actually very heavily looking forward to it.
[334:34.13]Six cubit.
[334:34.97]Thanks for the one dollar.
[334:35.83]Shame on you guys for making fun of Worm while he's doing his best.
[334:40.97]See, you... I just clicked on... I love books.

[335:46.42]Appreciate it I'm so lost I am too I have to
[335:53.57]Fred Flintstone, thanks for the $1.
[335:54.75]Honestly, it takes really high Q to watch a Jerma stream.
[335:57.21]The humor is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp on theoretical clownics, clown physics, most jokes will go over the viewer's heads.
[336:04.23]Yes.
[336:06.98]I agree.
[336:07.86]Thank you, DubskyDude, for the $1.
[336:09.24]Raw meatloaf is your meta have-done joke, isn't it?
[336:11.56]Haha, funny what-if observation streamer.
[336:13.70]Haha.
[336:17.06]I'm glad you felt that.
[336:17.96]See, that's like four jokes in one.
[336:22.28]Let me count them.
[336:24.91]Two.
[336:26.51]Three.
[336:28.16]There are four jokes in here, Dubski.
[336:31.72]Nice work.
[336:34.68]Thanks a lot for the $1.
[336:35.42]Appreciate it.
[336:36.00]Whatever Avenue, thanks for the $6.
[336:38.72]Jerma started the chat... The chat... The chat-racky war?
[336:51.20]Oh, you're talking about, like, a chat... Okay, I see what you're saying.
[336:54.44]Thank you, whatever avenue, for the six bucks.
[336:58.53]Thank you, greater head.
[336:59.71]There's no R. It's eight.
[337:03.98]I'm putting it backwards.
[337:05.42]Thank you, gator head.
[337:07.83]For the $9.80, 10 bucks.
[337:10.83]Wow, just passed a year sub to you, Jebediah.

[337:27.42]Appreciate it, dude.
[337:28.20]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[337:31.10]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[337:32.02]What is your favorite cheese?
[337:33.06]By the way, I hope you read Friday's Bits.
[337:36.07]Yeah, I'm sorry that that's not gonna happen.
[337:37.87]Like, let's go over that quickly.
[337:40.49]Um, I can't, because I was assuming that I was gonna stream on Friday, my recent events still were there, but because I lost power and I couldn't, like, go, I wasn't, I can't pull those back.
[337:53.76]So I'm really sorry to people that gave money and people that subbed on Friday, because I don't even know who the, I don't even know who the fuck it even was or is.
[338:04.75]My stream labs, I can't go back that far.
[338:09.55]I tried to look and it's not there.
[338:10.79]So I'm really sorry that happened.
[338:12.57]It was not my intention.
[338:15.03]But.
[338:16.61]But, but, but.
[338:19.91]What were we just saying?
[338:23.47]I forget.
[338:23.81]Oh, favorite cheese.
[338:26.55]Swiss cheese.
[338:29.12]A nice, good Swiss.
[338:31.92]Yeah, I would say you can put it on anything and it'll make it taste better.
[338:35.78]Not too much, though.
[338:37.02]Too much Swiss cheese can ruin the food.
[338:40.00]No.
[338:40.48]Only one spice.
[338:41.18]Don't go overboard.
[338:42.48]Cheese ain't that great for you anyways.
[338:43.64]Don't eat too much of it.
[338:46.95]Super seal.
[338:47.39]Thanks for the $1.
[338:47.85]Here's some fan art of raw meatloaf.
[338:53.53]Let's take a look.
[338:58.43]It's just a square.
[338:59.43]They just drew a square with a white background.
[339:04.34]That's it.
[339:08.55]That's another one.
[339:10.83]We're going to skip that donation.
[339:13.91]Please play this video.
[339:14.85]Okay.
[339:15.45]Sure.
[339:16.75]I'm kidding.
[339:20.37]I'm just kidding.
[339:21.09]I clicked it to make a quick little observation.
[339:24.57]A what-if scenario of somebody.
[339:25.83]What if somebody were to send me another one of those messages, right?
[339:29.36]And I clicked it.
[339:30.44]Not a joke.
[339:31.60]A what-if scenario.
[339:35.67]Thank you, Hydra, for the $1.
[339:38.51]Velcro, what a rip-off.
[339:41.57]Oh, I get it.
[339:42.01]I like that one.
[339:47.44]Lukam, or Lukam1230, thanks for the $1.5.
[339:50.20]Oh, what a cute wall.
[339:52.02]Yes.
[339:53.52]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[339:54.74]Wash your hair, you filthy swine.
[339:56.60]I wash my hair every day, and I condition it every day.
[340:00.46]My hair, you could eat off my hair.
[340:02.07]It's so clean.
[340:04.86]You can fry an egg on my hair, you know what I'm saying?
[340:06.72]You can crack an egg and fry an egg on my hair.
[340:13.26]Rat Goobers, thanks for the one dollar, can't beat the meat.
[340:17.04]Until it's ground up and added into another person's body and turned into another animal.
[340:22.10]Because that's what we did.
[340:24.44]Hi Lord Nameless, thank you for the one dollar, big skill, thank you.
[340:29.79]Gorgon Cow, thanks for the one dollar, I'm so proud of how much your meat has grown.
[340:36.48]That was cheap, but it was funny.
[340:41.27]Lancelot screams a lot, thanks for the $1.
[340:44.79]King Raw Meatloaf, first of his name, king of the Andals, Rhoynar and the First Men, king of the Seven Kingdoms, the undefeated.
[340:58.28]Thank you.
[340:58.80]Thank you, Mawzy, for the 25 cents.
[341:00.72]Meatloaf needs a bit of encouragement.
[341:06.53]Thanks, dude.
[341:07.51]Thank you, Brainwashed, for the $1.
[341:10.46]Wild Hubuddy for the 25 cents.
[341:12.40]The wall is just going to keep absorbing your monster's essences to prolong its life.
[341:18.26]Thanks, dude.
[341:18.88]Evil Donut, thanks for the $5.
[341:19.96]Farm the hell out of these bits.
[341:23.51]Glad they're going to you.
[341:24.61]Any chance of Rat Movie 3?
[341:27.55]Well, I leaked the plot of Rat Movie 3 a long time ago.
[341:33.91]Think about it like...
[341:36.58]What was the movie?
[341:38.22]Didn't somebody write a big movie and they leaked out the plot and then they never made the movie because everyone already knew the movie?
[341:44.61]Famous writer, right?
[341:45.55]Who did that?
[341:50.39]I want to say Quentin Tarantino.
[341:52.27]His entire script leaked out.
[341:54.19]The whole thing.
[341:55.51]Was it for The Hateful Eight?
[341:57.75]I forget.
[341:58.13]Yeah, it was Tarantino.
[341:59.57]Okay.
[342:04.16]Half-Life Episode 3.
[342:05.60]Yeah, Half-Life 3.
[342:09.48]Yeah, Tarantino, but he made it anyways.
[342:10.86]Yeah, that's true.
[342:11.90]Okay, just making sure I got it right.
[342:15.44]But probably not right now.
[342:18.28]There's too many other dumb things.
[342:19.80]Look, hold on.
[342:20.70]I'm not saying that's dumb.
[342:21.48]I'm saying that other dumb things are going on to prevent that from happening.
[342:26.62]Yeah, it was the rat sponsors.
[342:28.50]It was the sponsored rat video.
[342:31.31]Still might do it.
[342:34.26]Wouldn't that be worth it if I made like $40,000 on sponsorships for this video?
[342:40.05]And it was just the Rat Movie 3 sponsor video?
[342:45.33]Might be funny.
[342:47.57]That'd be cool.
[342:49.01]That'd be cool just to have $40,000 for sponsorships.
[342:52.05]And have them watch the video afterwards and take all the money away from me.
[342:56.24]Or they'll bring me to court.
[342:59.30]That'd be like that.
[343:00.06]Speaking of social media, that'd be a funny tweet.
[343:03.45]It'll go something like this.
[343:05.55]Like, hey guys, I have to remove my video of Rat Movie 3 because I'm getting sued by 19 companies.
[343:13.53]My life is ruined.
[343:16.02]Dot, dot, dot.
[343:19.06]Please retweet this and like this if you like me.
[343:21.70]If you like my videos, retweet this and share this.
[343:25.34]Get me on the front page of Reddit because companies are overstepping their boundaries on me.
[343:29.96]And then I'll get to the front page of Reddit.
[343:31.18]There'll be a huge story about YouTuber makes a video and these fucking companies come in and try to squelch his opinions.
[343:40.04]I'll get 50,000 thumbs up on Reddit.
[343:43.19]And I'll become a goddamn, I'll become a martyr for Reddit and the community.
[343:56.65]YouTuber.
[344:00.81]Well, where do you think it's gonna go?
[344:04.52]Yep, that'll do it.
[344:11.70]What, I said it wrong?
[344:13.15]Amartir.
[344:13.51]Yeah, it's a different term.
[344:17.51]Amartir.
[344:18.91]Amartir.
[344:21.13]That's the plo- I- What do you think the plot to Rat Woobie 3 is?
[344:27.57]You understand?
[344:27.87]Like, the Rat Movie sponsor video was gonna do all this.
[344:31.39]Maybe you'll see it one day.
[344:46.42]Uh, where were we?
[344:47.78]Thank you, Cheese It Up, for the 25 cents.
[344:49.38]Sweet Love, thank you.
[344:52.26]Thank you for your contribution to the stream.
[344:54.40]Appreciate it.
[344:58.91]Thank you to GoldenGuy90 for the $1.
[345:01.83]Sweet Rind is my spirit animal.
[345:03.99]Now isn't everybody so upset that we didn't get to use him?
[345:08.15]He's gone forever.
[345:12.03]Gone, but not forgotten, I guess, right?
[345:16.31]Again, KXE501 with $100.
[345:19.29]Second $100 bit donation of the night.
[345:22.47]Thank you so much, dude.
[345:24.74]Well, it wasn't twice by him, but that's the second time it happened tonight, which is... a lot.
[345:31.17]Thank you, both of you.
[345:33.07]KXE, thank you so much for the $100.
[345:35.97]You rock.
[345:39.73]E Cookie, thanks for the 56 cents.
[345:41.75]You're sitting here arguing whether to play one colored shape or another.
[345:47.77]It's PlayStation 1!
[345:50.71]PlayStation 1 was just a series of blocks and bricks.
[345:53.97]Did you ever see Tomb Raider?
[345:56.82]Lara Croft is made up of two triangles, three rectangles, two circles, and three cylinders.
[346:06.18]It's just shapes on your screen.
[346:10.65]FatSnowManDude, thanks for the one dollar.
[346:13.25]Bring back SweetRind and name him Walter Mellon.
[346:19.05]I don't get the reference.
[346:24.60]But thanks for the $1.
[346:27.16]Gorgon Cow, thanks for the $1.
[346:28.58]Bring back the Rind.
[346:29.72]There's going to be a lot of these.
[346:37.39]I guarantee it.
[346:38.21]A lot of these are going to be in a row about bringing back the Rind.
[346:42.41]They're solely disappointed because it didn't happen.
[346:46.99]This was an hour ago.
[346:49.52]Uh, Aphra... Aphrodarty, thanks for the five bucks again here.
[346:54.04]I donated earlier, but Edgehog's screaming has made me laugh harder than ever.
[346:57.26]Yeah, well, we got the scream back, but we're not playing this again.
[347:04.47]I might just play it again, like, on an off day.
[347:07.57]I don't know, I like this game.
[347:09.51]We'll see.
[347:10.91]KXZ again!
[347:12.03]A hundred and ten dollars here total.
[347:15.84]Thanks for the ten bucks here.
[347:17.00]Pledge to the edge, rind left behind.
[347:23.25]What are you gonna do about purple?
[347:25.55]Pledge to the edge, rhyme left behind.
[347:27.20]It's purple's time to shine.
[347:30.18]There you go.
[347:34.44]Crunchy Jester, thanks for the one dolly.
[347:36.06]It wasn't until I became president that I realized... What?
[347:41.59]What did you realize?
[347:42.23]You cut yourself off.
[347:44.73]You realized the what?
[347:50.39]Wonderful telephone.
[347:51.33]Thanks for the 30 cents.
[347:52.19]Have you considered being a guest on a podcast?
[347:54.03]I'd love to watch you seriously talking with someone.
[347:57.36]There's been talk a couple times.
[348:01.64]Nothing really ever... I never really reached out to any of the people that... There was a few that people wanted me to go on.
[348:08.71]There's been a couple.
[348:11.39]I would do it.
[348:11.93]I'm just like really... I don't know.
[348:16.63]I'm a fucking weirdo, right?
[348:19.37]And I feel like if you put me in a room with like five strangers that don't know me or don't know the things that I say, people are gonna be like, who the fuck is this guy?
[348:29.60]This guy's a weirdo.
[348:31.31]Do we really want him in the same room?
[348:34.72]I'll like sneeze on somebody.
[348:36.04]I'll sneeze on somebody's face and I'll get thrown out.
[348:39.24]I'll be talking and in my head I'll have this funny joke where I sneeze in the guy's face.
[348:44.06]And then halfway through I realize this is a bad idea and then I'm gonna get kicked out.
[348:47.13]They're gonna throw me out by like, they're gonna grab me by my pants and my shirt and they're gonna go one, two and they're gonna just let me go and I'm gonna fly out like in a cartoon.
[348:57.51]I would never sneeze in somebody's face.
[348:58.95]Please, give me a break.
[349:01.38]That's so awful and disgusting.
[349:03.46]That was an observation.
[349:04.26]That was a what if.
[349:05.26]See?
[349:05.98]Not a joke.
[349:06.92]That was a what if I did that situation.
[349:09.45]Are you understanding now?
[349:10.31]You're getting it?
[349:11.85]Should we go?
[349:13.07]We're in comedy school right now.
[349:15.21]That was a what if scenario.
[349:18.02]What if I sneeze directly in somebody's face?
[349:19.88]What might happen to me?

[350:38.21]I didn't mean it.
[350:40.01]What a corporate way of saying- How is that a corporate way of saying things?
[350:43.17]A corporate way of saying things would tell you to stay subscribed, because if you stay subscribed for three months, you're gonna get a fucking magazine sent to your door.
[350:51.29]I'm gonna give you a subscription to a magazine.
[350:53.23]If you stay subscribed for six months, oh, stay subscribed for a year, you're gonna get 30% off in our in-fucking-store.

[351:09.65]What kind of magazine?
[351:12.49]A magazine of me.
[351:15.23]Writing.
[351:15.59]About a bunch of deep shit.
[351:20.72]Five pictures of me in different positions.
[351:23.70]Every month.
[351:25.54]And then tons of fucking just deep shit on every other page.
[351:30.76]Me posing with various objects.
[351:37.84]Maybe I'll do my own funnies.
[351:40.18]The last page will have maybe four or five different kind of comics.
[351:43.41]Three, four panels each.
[351:45.06]I'll make my own funnies.
[351:51.26]Didn't somebody do this?
[351:54.86]Wasn't there a YouTuber that made his own like magazine or book or something and it was like 28 pages and half the pages were like his favorite songs and pictures of his face and it wasn't supposed to be like a joke?
[352:08.55]This actually happened, right?
[352:15.89]Who was that?
[352:16.85]Did this actually happen?
[352:24.96]I feel like this did happen.
[352:32.27]It was on Kickstarter.
[352:39.01]Eat a dirty diaper on stream.
[352:40.51]What are you talking about?
[352:41.52]Why are you saying this?
[352:42.82]Why would you come and say this?
[352:49.76]We're like, we're having a completely different conversation.
[352:52.40]Talking about, hey, what was that?
[352:53.62]What magazine was that?
[352:54.92]Eat a dirty diaper on stream.
[353:00.72]That's, uh, why?
[353:03.99]Why did I read that?
[353:05.01]Why did he write it?
[353:06.99]Why did he write it?
[353:07.97]You know, like, it was fucking funny.
[353:10.65]Because, like, why?
[353:11.61]I don't know, because it was so out of place.
[353:20.98]We're sitting there having a conversation.
[353:22.46]I love when people just open the door.
[353:24.71]It's like, that's okay.
[353:26.49]Imagine if you were at a coffee shop and you were with a bunch of your friends.
[353:31.22]And you're talking about, I don't know, you're talking about politics or something.
[353:34.69]You're talking about the latest game that came out.
[353:36.57]You just got your order.
[353:37.41]You got like a fucking large venti latte with some cherry sauce and soy in there.
[353:42.17]That's fine.
[353:42.57]You sit down.
[353:43.05]We're having a conversation.
[353:44.25]Somebody opens up the door to the Starbucks while you guys are talking about your games of the year for 2017.
[353:49.29]And some random guy, you don't know who this person is.
[353:53.57]And he walks over to your table that you're sitting at with your friends, sits down and goes...
[353:57.59]You guys, all three of you should eat a dirty diaper right now.
[354:01.54]And then he gets up and leaves.
[354:03.72]What would you do?
[354:05.72]What would your reaction be?
[354:07.30]It would be like, why did that guy just do that to us?
[354:10.68]What was the point of that?
[354:11.70]There's no reason for that.
[354:26.71]I would call the police.
[354:28.47]I would ask him for the diaper.
[354:30.57]What?
[354:30.73]So he could prove that he had it?
[354:35.48]He gave a suggestion.
[354:36.58]What?
[354:36.92]Why?
[354:43.52]Eat a dirty diaper.
[354:44.44]I'm calling the cops.
[354:47.52]The police show up.
[354:48.81]You get out your phone, you call the police, dial the number, the police show up.
[354:52.23]What's happening here?
[354:52.95]This guy asked me to eat a dirty diaper.
[354:55.63]It would just be like, what the fuck are we doing here?
[355:03.23]I'm like crying right now.
[355:04.27]This is actually really funny to me.
[355:11.92]The guy's already gone.
[355:16.32]Is that guy still even in the chat?
[355:17.98]I don't even know what his name was.
[355:21.38]Are you still here?
[355:22.03]I hope you are.
[355:24.23]We need a second comment from you.
[355:27.77]We need comment number two.
[355:29.51]Whatever it is, I can't wait for it.
[355:31.33]What is it?
[355:35.47]Does anyone remember who it was?
[355:37.86]Oh, here it is.
[355:38.74]I missed the entire stream.
[355:40.36]It was this guy.
[355:49.65]So you are the guy that came into the Starbucks mid-conversation.
[355:53.87]You are the guy that we are talking about.
[355:57.66]Ugh.
[356:02.02]Alright, let's move on before I fucking have a- get a migraine from laughing at this.
[356:06.92]No, I'm not drunk.
[356:08.44]This whole thing is spiraled out of control.
[356:12.60]Somebody gift him a sub.
[356:16.54]Ugh.
[356:22.33]I keep thinking of a guy just coming up to me and saying that while I'm talking with my friend.
[356:32.68]What would you put on your Starbucks badge?
[356:35.44]Dumbass.
[356:38.44]I don't know.
[356:39.04]That was fucking perfect.
[356:46.41]Starbucks badge.
[356:49.85]Ugh.
[356:51.47]Dreadbeard, thank you for that.
[356:52.67]That was fucking perfect.
[356:55.03]You just made us all laugh.
[356:58.57]You slayed this whole fucking room.
[357:03.43]Bless you.
[357:04.55]God bless you.
[357:12.39]Anyways.
[357:14.48]Let's move on.
[357:15.36]He is a sub.
[357:23.38]Where were we?
[357:23.84]Here.
[357:32.28]No, nobody gets modded.
[357:33.83]He just subbed.
[357:36.35]He just subbed like a minute ago.

[359:36.85]Hey, Jerma, noticed you've been on multiple bathroom breaks.
[359:39.38]Why not try the revolutionary, as seen on TV, product, the Euro Club?
[359:44.73]A patented golf club designed to have a container you can piss into.
[359:47.79]This is an actual product with a commercial.
[359:52.87]If you take out your penis on a golf course, you're going to jail.
[359:55.63]Like, you're going to go to prison.
[359:58.87]Please don't do that.
[360:01.45]Thank you, Sam.
[360:04.62]Thank you, TechnoToast, for the $1.50.
[360:06.76]Thank you for streaming my sweet boy from one person living in Massachusetts to another.
[360:11.56]Good luck in the snowstorm tomorrow.

[360:27.84]Hopefully it's not.
[360:28.68]It's happening tomorrow.
[360:29.62]I'm not streaming tomorrow, so... Who knows, though.
[360:33.98]As the last few days have shown, it's pretty unpredictable at this point, so... We'll see.
[360:40.60]Good luck to you as well.
[360:43.08]Techno toast hope you're safe.
[360:44.36]Stay safe.

[360:51.44]Thanks for the three dollars and 42 cents any chance of a battle block theater co-op italic stream I think you guys would like it also hi mom Battle block theater is one of those games where I From the outside looking in it looks really boring to me.
[361:08.69]I
[361:10.00]It's probably not the case, but I think, I don't know, the way that it looks and the way that it looks like it plays, it's almost like a... Now tell me, this is a completely ignorant opinion.
[361:19.68]Is it like Bloody Trap Land, but made by Tom Fulp?
[361:27.78]Is it a Bloody Trap Land made by Tom Fulp that is in that same kind of realm of, like, kind of Newgroundsy?
[361:43.73]easier.
[361:44.49]It's no, not really.
[361:45.59]Kinda.
[361:47.99]It's comparable.
[361:50.43]It's not that hard.
[361:59.84]It's not as difficult as Bloody Trapland.
[362:01.58]It's more of a puzzle game than a parkour game.
[362:03.36]Okay.
[362:06.29]Pit People is... Pit People is like a strategy game though, isn't it?
[362:10.59]That's a tile strategy game.
[362:12.33]I don't play those.
[362:13.07]I don't.
[362:16.00]I just don't.
[362:16.94]The last tile strategy game that I played was Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[362:22.68]And I would argue that that's the only one you should ever be playing.
[362:27.32]Because I'm an old hipster edgelord.
[362:31.39]I'm an edgehog.
[362:32.01]Thank you, gas station soda.
[362:39.63]Maybe.

[363:27.57]So, don't even worry about that.
[363:28.31]You've contributed a lot of money already.
[363:30.27]So, good luck getting a job.
[363:30.99]Good luck in the storm if you're in the New England area.
[363:33.29]If not, then thank you.
[363:35.21]Appreciate the concern.
[363:55.48]Thank you so much, Grizzly.
[363:56.52]Appreciate it, man.
[363:58.38]JakeGames23, thanks for the $1.
[364:01.48]I would like one t-shirt, please.
[364:03.34]Thanks.
[364:06.42]Uh, they're not for sale yet.
[364:08.56]They will be.
[364:09.92]Oh, they will be.
[364:11.22]Oh, they will be soon.
[364:13.28]TM, soon TM.
[364:14.38]That's a funny joke.
[364:15.54]See, that's a joke.
[364:16.52]That was a joke.
[364:17.96]Soon TM is like, that is a joke that everyone's made a thousand times.
[364:22.77]I'm just making it again.
[364:27.44]Thank you, Fred Flintstone, for the $1.
[364:29.86]Let's have a moment of silence for our fallen sweet rind.
[364:32.36]He will live in our cold hearts.
[364:33.86]Be strong rind heads.
[364:37.03]Thank you, RoboChicken77 for the $1.
[364:39.87]Finally missed a stream.
[364:41.13]I want to let you know I've been going through some rough shit lately.
[364:44.13]And your content makes me feel better.
[364:45.43]Thanks.
[364:46.27]Keep being great.
[364:49.90]Thank you, RoboChicken, for the $1.
[364:51.92]Appreciate it.
[364:53.82]And...
[364:56.35]Every time I hear somebody say this, I just have to say the same thing again.
[365:00.84]Please, stick around in the community.
[365:04.90]Talk to some of the people that are here.
[365:06.14]Go join the Discord.
[365:09.00]Talk to some people in your own life.
[365:11.54]You know, obviously, it's, you know, not everything can be answered by somebody online, right?
[365:16.35]Or in a Discord or something, but... I'm really sorry you're going through some rough shit.
[365:24.18]But thank you for even considering me as somebody that can make you feel better.
[365:30.61]I highly, highly appreciate that, dude.
[365:36.15]Shout out the Discord while we're at it.
[365:37.51]It's a great place.
[365:42.02]Us glueheads don't take kindly to non-glueheads.
[365:45.46]Oh, God.
[365:48.98]And finally, to wrap it up, Jan Goagogo, thanks for the $10 at the very end.
[365:54.96]For the only streamer that fights fans and eats dirty diapers.
[365:58.65]Thank you, Jan Goagogo.
[366:00.77]I appreciate that.
[366:02.21]I'm the only guy on Twitch that can say that he's done that.
[366:05.39]He's fought every one of his fans during a stream and ate a dur- No, I didn't- Wait, hold on.
[366:10.91]I didn't do either one of those two things.
[366:14.72]Those are hypothetical what-ifs funny comedy scenarios.
[366:19.23]By the way, neither one of those are jokes.
[366:25.61]Just making an observation here.
[366:30.67]Thanks, everybody.
[366:31.71]If I don't see you on Thursday...
[366:33.85]Absolutely, I will see you as soon as possible.
[366:36.33]Keep you updated.
[366:36.91]Keep an eye on the Twitter.
[366:38.97]Good night.
[366:39.55]Good luck to you.
[366:41.27]If you're in New England, be safe in the storm, especially middle Massachusetts, like western Massachusetts.
[366:50.02]Be safe, because it's going to be a lot of snow.
[366:53.88]Take care, everybody.
[366:55.90]I'll keep you up to date.
[366:56.74]See you soon.
[366:57.46]Good night.
