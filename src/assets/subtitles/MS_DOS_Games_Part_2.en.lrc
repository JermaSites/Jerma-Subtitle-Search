[00:01.11]Hi.
[00:02.39]Hold on, I gotta grab my... One sec.
[01:04.92]OK.
[01:06.62]Good afternoon everybody.
[01:08.72]Good evening.
[01:12.98]We are going to do.
[01:15.54]It is Saturday.
[01:16.16]So you know what that means the last few weeks.
[01:20.96]That means.
[01:22.84]Microsoft.
[01:25.30]Distributed operating system.
[01:28.48]Microsoft.
[01:31.08]Operating system.
[01:38.86]We ended last night very late.
[01:42.65]So I figured I'd give myself another hour or two.
[01:46.61]Still in the window, though.
[01:50.71]Doink occupied stream?
[01:53.41]Like, doink the clown?
[02:00.64]Did Cox finally fix the internet?
[02:03.10]No.
[02:04.42]Unfortunately not.
[02:09.71]We still have problems.
[02:11.85]But we did change over IPS.
[02:13.46]We have static IP now.
[02:16.54]They know there's a problem.
[02:18.08]They know it exists.
[02:19.46]But I don't think they can fix it.
[02:21.60]Because of a million different things.
[02:26.30]And... I feel like I've been talking about this the last week straight.
[02:32.11]So I'd like to not even think about the internet.
[02:34.59]You know?
[02:34.81]I don't even want to think about it.
[02:37.65]Let's just pretend it's not a problem.
[02:41.18]Until it is one, right?
[02:47.14]Ten years.
[02:51.54]But it was actually, it was alright yesterday.
[02:54.45]Yesterday was fine.
[02:56.67]And then into today, seems like it's okay.
[02:59.89]I mean, probably gonna drop frames, but I don't think it'll be a huge issue.
[03:05.11]Although I've been wrong many times before.
[03:06.87]I'm gonna just make a tweet, and I'll be right back when we get started.
[04:17.73]Alrighty.
[04:19.09]Welcome.
[04:21.49]I'm ready to check out a few more of these games.
[04:27.32]Why not DOS and DOS Nots?
[04:31.24]Because it's Do's and Do's Nots.
[04:33.58]No, it's Do and Do Nots.
[04:37.70]DOS and Do Nots.
[04:40.00]Whatever, the title's not changed.
[04:48.22]What does the title say?
[04:51.42]DOS and Do Nots.
[04:53.16]Yeah, like Do's and Do Nots.
[04:55.72]Some of these are great.
[04:56.44]Some of these are like, I'm not even going to click them.
[05:06.99]Should it be Do's and Don'ts?
[05:09.57]No, then you can't have the S.
[05:14.83]DOS donuts.
[05:16.39]Speaking of DOS, and not necessarily donuts, take a look at that.
[05:22.04]So, the last time we did this, I'll show you.
[05:27.54]We did, we changed categories.
[05:29.27]Instead of, let's see here where we are up here.
[05:31.21]This is where we started.
[05:32.73]I was sorting by views last time, the time before that.
[05:38.33]And then the last time we did this, I just kind of picked a random page.
[05:42.35]So today we're going to go back to like the popular tab.
[05:45.91]And we're going to go down to where we were last time.
[05:49.07]There's Super Mario's Video Game Gallery.
[05:50.89]We can tell that's a good one.
[05:51.73]I already know that's a good one.
[05:56.25]So this is where we ended up two, three weeks ago, right?
[06:03.01]Because I remember Dangerous Dave's Haunted Mansion.
[06:06.37]And then we ended up about here.
[06:09.18]Right here, just about.
[06:11.56]So, because the way that these, they kind of move up and down, they're not in a straight line anymore, I would say the only ones you should be clicking on are the ones that the text is visible.
[06:21.73]Right?
[06:22.33]Don't click on these ones down here.
[06:24.93]Right?
[06:25.13]Because we don't know what they are.
[06:27.18]Visible text only.
[06:31.22]And if you have a moment, I would just love if you would pick the first game we're going to play right now.
[06:45.99]What?
[06:46.51]Okay, you guys clicked so fast that you broke the click thing.
[06:53.13]And no, porn games are not going to be played.
[06:54.91]Remember, this is DOS and DOS nots.
[06:57.17]This is dots and do nots.
[07:00.39]I'll change that title.
[07:01.15]That's better.
[07:10.04]What do we got?
[07:12.23]By the way, the rules have changed.
[07:14.03]We're gonna do three on this list.
[07:18.32]Just pick three, and then we'll move on.
[07:22.34]It looks like I'm gonna play The Hobbit.
[07:28.65]I just, I guess it's the title that everybody, it's, just click on that one, Jeremy, because it says Hobbit in the title.
[07:36.63]Like, bugs to a lamp.
[07:40.44]Alright.
[07:42.52]Can you guys even see my cursor?
[07:45.12]That's odd.
[07:46.20]You should be able to see my cursor.
[07:49.04]Alright, thank you.
[07:49.64]Now I'm going to click on the Hobbit.
[07:52.54]And let's go.
[07:59.13]For some reason you guys are still on the screen.
[08:01.65]Okay.
[08:03.41]This is 1993 from Milbus Software.
[08:09.53]And we need to...
[08:12.71]What do we have to do?
[08:13.25]What are we changing?
[08:13.93]What?
[08:16.15]Why can you guys not see this?
[08:23.38]What the fuck is going on here?
[08:26.58]Oh, right!
[08:27.24]I remember last... Okay, I remember, I remember, because my scene is messed up.
[08:31.28]Because last time we did this, I had to... Remember I zoomed in really far because we couldn't read the text?
[08:37.39]Here, I'll just do this.
[08:39.97]Fix this real quick.
[08:44.26]Yeah, I remember now.
[08:45.98]There we go.
[08:46.72]Okay.
[08:47.48]Alright, here we go.
[08:48.98]Choose monitor type.
[08:51.02]This is mono or color.
[08:53.94]Mono means it's going to be black and white, right?
[08:56.50]So we want to do color.
[09:00.38]Kind of wish I picked the other one.
[09:04.30]The Hobbit.
[09:04.90]Press space to begin the game.
[09:09.33]Choose display width 40 or 80.
[09:14.92]I mean, we have to do 80, right?
[09:17.04]Do you want 8?
[09:18.22]No, no, no, I want 80.
[09:19.28]I don't want 8.
[09:24.24]Do I want pictures?
[09:26.32]Oh my god, what the fuck is happening?
[09:30.52]I didn't pick 8 resolution, did I?
[09:32.26]That's not possible.
[09:33.32]It's 80.
[09:35.54]You are in a comfortable tunnel-like hall with a perfectly round green door like a porthole.
[09:42.80]Ow!
[09:45.46]You are in a comfortable tunnel-like hall with a perfectly round green door like a porthole.
[09:51.46]The walls are paneled, the floors are tiled and carpeted, and there are a number of polished chairs around the walls.
[09:56.72]To the east there is a round green door.
[09:57.95]You can see Gandalf.
[09:58.71]Gandalf is carrying a curious map.
[10:00.21]Thorin, the wooden chest.
[10:01.61]Gandalf gives the curious map to you.
[10:04.73]Thorin, rising to his feet, says to you, Well, Mr. Baggins, it's all ready for our adventure, and I must say they're looking very hopeful.
[10:09.45]Shall we be off then?
[10:10.41]You wait.
[10:10.73]Time passes.
[10:11.31]Gandalf opens the round green door.
[10:12.49]You wait.
[10:12.81]Time passes.
[10:13.33]Gandalf goes east.
[10:14.45]You wait.
[10:14.79]Time passes.
[10:16.71]What do I need to do?
[10:17.23]You wait, wait, wait.
[10:26.03]Dude, I don't see the ring anywhere.
[10:28.59]Wait, what am I supposed to do?
[10:31.69]You wait to... Okay, it freaked me out.
[10:33.97]Go east.
[10:37.32]What?
[10:40.52]You are in a gloomy, empty land with dreary hills ahead.
[10:44.26]Rising higher and higher, dark with trees.
[10:52.60]On some of the hills are old castles that have a very evil look about them.
[10:57.00]To the west there is the round green door.
[10:59.92]Visible exits are east, north, and northeast.
[11:03.51]You can see nothing.
[11:04.65]Thorin enters!
[11:07.11]Thorin?
[11:07.41]Where?
[11:07.80]What do you mean Thorin enters?
[11:08.96]Where is he?
[11:15.77]You attack Thorin, but the effort is wasted.
[11:18.81]His defense is too strong.
[11:20.25]Thorin attacks you, but the effect is wasted.
[11:23.21]Your defense is too strong.
[11:26.49]You have mastered 2% of the adventure.
[11:28.83]You are dead.
[11:30.51]What?
[11:31.61]With one well-placed blow, Thorin cleaves... Cleaves your skull.
[11:42.74]You are dead.
[11:51.28]The story of Bilbo Baggins.
[11:54.86]Oof, a hobbit.
[11:57.40]A wizard is never late, nor is he early.
[12:00.75]A wizard, wait, what, he's dead?
[12:03.05]Who killed him?
[12:04.29]Who killed him?
[12:09.47]Can I restart?
[12:11.95]Oh.
[12:14.24]Yes, of course I do.
[12:15.66]Let's try this again.
[12:16.66]Gary, you're in the green door.
[12:18.20]I'm inside my hobbit place, right?
[12:22.90]Gandalf is carrying a curious map.
[12:24.84]Look at the map.
[12:28.00]Look what?
[12:28.76]Map.
[12:30.12]You look at the curious map.
[12:31.48]It is a map drawn on a piece of parchment of the area around the Lonely Mountain.
[12:35.82]There seem to be some symbols on it, but you cannot read them.
[12:38.85]Gandalf opens the round green door.
[12:41.03]Thorin says, Well, are we going to just stand here all day?
[12:43.97]Okay.
[12:45.53]Gandalf goes east.
[12:47.97]Follow Gandalf.
[12:52.68]Okay, we're back here.
[12:55.88]Gandalf takes the Curious Map.
[12:57.40]Thorin enters.
[12:58.28]Follow Gandalf.
[12:59.10]Okay, talk to Gandalf.
[13:19.11]You talk to Gandalf.
[13:19.95]Gandalf says, fascinating, but I wonder what I could use it for.
[13:24.59]Thorin says, hurry up.
[13:28.28]What is he, what?
[13:29.86]Use map.
[13:43.45]Northeast.
[13:45.29]Go northeast!
[13:46.57]I'm not gonna kill Gandalf.
[13:48.41]Here we go.
[13:49.73]You are on the almost hidden path through the trees.
[13:55.19]On the ground are many trolls' footprints.
[13:57.77]To the north there is the heavy rock door.
[14:00.05]Invisible exits are south.
[14:01.77]You see nothing.
[14:02.47]Just wanna make sure he's still here.
[14:12.40]Oh no, Gandalf's not here anymore.
[14:19.14]Let's go north.
[14:20.24]You cannot go north.
[14:22.72]The heavy rock door.
[14:23.88]South.
[14:24.22]I can't do anything.
[14:26.84]Talk to Thorin.
[14:31.85]You talked to Thorin.
[14:35.95]Where?
[14:39.27]Hi.
[14:40.39]What?
[15:12.54]I do not know the word.
[15:14.00]It's.
[15:18.94]What happened to the word 20?
[15:21.94]You wait.
[15:22.30]Time passes.
[15:23.10]I don't know.
[15:23.38]What do we do?
[15:24.64]What happens in the first part of the movie?
[15:29.79]What happens in The Hobbit?
[15:32.27]I try to open the door.
[15:33.59]The door is locked.
[15:44.52]Alright, south.
[15:47.65]You are in a small clearing, half hidden amongst the trees.
[15:50.03]Yes, yes, yes.
[15:51.95]A hideous troll.
[15:53.01]Uh-oh.
[15:54.85]You can go south, west, south, east, or north.
[15:57.04]You see a hideous troll.
[15:58.40]A troll is carrying the large key.
[16:00.58]And a vicious troll.
[16:02.54]Thorin enters.
[16:03.76]A hideous troll says, Blimey, look at this.
[16:07.21]Can you cook them?
[16:09.15]Yeah, I could try, but I wouldn't make above a mouthful.
[16:13.07]Thorin remarks to you.
[16:15.49]Well, thief, you don't seem to be making a very good beginning to this adventure.
[16:19.58]I hope you have some idea how to get us out of this mess.
[16:22.56]You wait.
[16:23.58]Time passes.
[16:25.04]The hideous troll eats you.
[16:27.56]His foul gluttony has killed a hideous troll.
[16:30.38]You are dead.
[16:34.50]I was too slow?
[16:43.14]Did I have to go faster than that?
[16:44.56]I was reading the text!
[16:52.82]I guess I had to just go immediately.
[16:54.84]Alright, one last try.
[16:55.74]Let's try it again.
[17:01.38]Okay, we're gonna go follow Gandalf.
[17:02.42]What do you mean I can't follow Gandalf from here?
[17:12.36]Oh, Gandalf hasn't left.
[17:17.80]Okay, it's map drawn.
[17:19.02]Gandalf opens the round door.
[17:20.58]We're going to go follow Gandalf.
[17:28.97]I'm doing my slash following.
[17:31.59]Go east.
[17:38.17]Close the door.
[17:41.76]Alright, Gandalf enters.
[17:42.77]Okay, we're east.
[17:44.91]You can go east, north, or northeast.
[17:47.13]Let's go northeast.
[17:49.29]I gotta hurry up, though, because you don't have to look... This is the hidden path.
[17:52.73]No, let's go back.
[17:55.58]Wait, did I go... Go south.
[17:58.46]Alright, here's the trolls.
[18:02.84]Here we go, here we go.
[18:03.36]Ready?
[18:06.02]Go... Go north.
[18:08.32]No, no, no, go south.
[18:12.75]Go, um, hide.
[18:15.27]Hide.
[18:16.87]Run.
[18:18.53]Made it.
[18:22.19]You're on a good path at the brink of a fast-flowing river.
[18:29.71]Alright, here we go.
[18:33.29]Behind a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet crosses the river.
[18:38.36]Ahead you can see the last homely house.
[18:40.62]You can go east and west.
[18:42.61]You can see Elrond, Thorin, hey, hey, Elrond.
[18:45.09]You wait time, but Thorin, with a faraway look on his eyes, starts muttering about gold and treasure.
[18:48.29]Elrond gives him lunch, eat.
[18:51.19]You eat some lunch.
[18:52.01]Thorin says, hurry up, day dawns.
[18:53.71]What?
[18:57.57]Inquire about the ring.
[18:58.71]I don't know, leave, exit, go north?
[19:02.25]Hello?
[19:04.13]Hello?
[19:05.72]You- Hello!
[19:06.72]Time passes!
[19:08.26]Thorin starts singing about gold.
[19:10.24]Elrond gives some lunch to you.
[19:11.52]Eat lunch!
[19:12.64]You eat some lunch.
[19:13.24]It was delicious.
[19:20.71]Talk to Elrond.
[19:24.75]You talk to Elrond.
[19:25.71]Thorin waits.
[19:32.99]There's nothing to eat.
[19:34.31]Okay, let's leave.
[19:38.64]Go north.
[19:40.78]You cannot go north.
[19:42.98]Hurry up.
[19:43.46]What are we hurrying for?
[19:44.51]I can't talk to... Go west.
[19:49.77]You go west.
[19:50.33]The troll's clearing.
[19:51.69]Visible exits are southwest, southeast, north.
[19:54.81]You can see Gandalf.
[19:58.11]The large key.
[19:58.86]Gandalf takes the large key.
[20:00.18]Thorin enters.
[20:00.76]You wait.
[20:01.14]Time passes.
[20:01.60]Gandalf says, what's this, I wonder?
[20:02.82]Take key.
[20:04.24]Take key.
[20:06.18]Gandalf is carrying the key.
[20:07.70]Talk to Gandalf.
[20:10.76]Gandalf gives the large key to you.
[20:12.82]Well, are we going to just stand here all day?
[20:14.44]Alright, uh... Go to the... What was it?
[20:17.38]The heavy door?
[20:19.08]South?
[20:19.46]Go south.
[20:22.52]You cannot go south.
[20:23.22]Go north?
[20:25.32]Go northeast.
[20:27.54]Follow Gandalf.
[20:32.08]Um...
[20:34.68]Leave.
[20:36.72]You leave.
[20:37.24]Time passes.
[20:38.46]Gandalf goes southeast.
[20:39.50]Go southeast.
[20:43.53]Rivendell.
[20:44.23]Visible exits are east, west.
[20:45.49]You can see Gandalf and Elrond.
[20:47.25]Gandalf goes east.
[20:49.13]Thorin enters.
[20:50.11]Elrond says hello.
[20:51.21]Yes, hello.
[20:53.12]You say hello.
[20:53.98]Time passes.
[20:54.64]Elrond gives some lunch to you.
[20:56.16]I guess I'll leave.
[20:57.24]You eat some lunch.
[20:58.02]Thorin says, well, we're gonna just stand here all day?
[21:01.30]Go east.
[21:07.05]You are on a hard, dangerous path in the Misty Mountains.
[21:13.29]The path is marked with white stones, of which many are small and others are half covered with moss or Heather.
[21:17.94]You can go east, north, west, you can go any direction.
[21:20.00]Where's Gandalf?
[21:22.52]Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.
[21:24.04]The mean goblin enters.
[21:24.88]Go Gandalf!
[21:26.32]Go Gandalf!
[21:26.88]Gandalf!
[21:27.61]Go north!
[21:28.51]Go north!
[21:29.67]Go north!
[21:32.95]You are on a narrow path at the top of the valley, which opens suddenly at your feet.
[21:39.84]You are on a narrow path atop a valley which opens suddenly at your feet.
[21:44.16]At the bottom of the valley, trees can be seen poking above the mist, and the sound of running water can be heard.
[21:49.44]You can go east, north, south.
[21:51.44]You see dead Gandalf.
[22:04.01]Attack!
[22:05.07]Attack!
[22:06.31]Attack goblin!
[22:07.45]Who killed Gandalf?
[22:10.04]Attack troll?
[22:13.18]The mean goblin captures you.
[22:14.56]It is too dark to see anything.
[22:18.28]Did Gandalf fall off the mountain?
[22:20.74]Oh, this is so stupid.
[22:23.38]Run!
[22:26.04]You go somewhere, but in the dark you stumble and fall heavily to the ground.
[22:29.06]It is too dark to see anything.
[22:30.49]Hide.
[22:30.77]Pray.
[22:35.19]Pray.
[22:39.34]struggle go east in the dark light use light light you light time passes thorin appears thorin to you thorin asks would it perchance be too much trouble to inquire as to your plans for getting us out of here or are we just going to sit around it all day in this dungeon time passes you hear a noise
[23:09.98]You wait.
[23:10.32]Time passes.
[23:10.84]You hear a noise.
[23:16.37]It's too dark to see anything.

[23:20.67]Listen.
[23:21.97]Um... Walk?

[23:31.72]Run.
[23:34.12]You stumble and fall heavily to the ground.
[23:35.52]It is too dark to see.
[23:36.24]You hear a noise.
[23:44.12]You hear a noise.
[23:45.26]Again.
[23:52.06]Uh... It's too dark to see anything.
[24:00.79]You hear a distant vroom.
[24:02.41]How long are we gonna be in here for?
[24:03.85]Just eat?
[24:05.47]Nothing to eat.
[24:05.95]How long are we gonna be just sitting here for?
[24:09.29]Follow.
[24:10.79]Follow noise.
[24:15.58]Go noise.
[24:18.48]Noise.
[24:20.72]Talk to Thorin.
[24:24.85]I see nothing here.
[24:25.89]What are you talking about?
[24:26.81]Talk?
[24:27.11]Like, it's too dark to talk.
[24:31.55]I can't, it's too dark to talk.
[24:35.24]Call out.
[24:36.82]Yell.

[24:42.60]Run.
[24:44.16]Run.
[24:45.77]I just keep falling down.
[24:46.73]Run.
[24:49.31]I'm just running into walls back and forth.
[24:56.63]Use the light.
[25:00.09]But they don't know the word use.
[25:01.97]Light.
[25:03.79]You light.
[25:04.77]Time passes.
[25:05.67]Run.
[25:06.47]It's too dark.
[25:07.05]You light.
[25:15.70]Take the ring.
[25:19.54]But you can't follow the noise because it's too dark and they don't know what the word noise is.
[25:24.87]Lantern?
[25:26.77]Inventory.
[25:29.99]I can't see my inventory.
[25:32.17]How dark is it in here?
[25:34.45]Wear ring.
[25:37.88]Ring.
[25:39.80]What?
[25:46.99]Open eyes.
[25:47.77]Oh, what if I only had just kept my eyes open this whole time?
[25:51.10]It would have been so much easier.
[25:52.94]Equip ring.
[25:55.64]I don't know what that word means.
[26:04.18]Hear.
[26:06.82]Noise.

[27:46.51]You cannot climb into Thorin.
[27:51.08]Look, a window.
[27:52.08]You can't climb in to Thorin.
[27:57.39]No, I don't think I would like to either, so.
[27:59.07]Yeah, when I say talk Thorin, I can't talk to Thorin.
[28:10.89]Apparently, we cannot talk.
[28:15.27]You sleep.
[28:34.11]I think I'm just dead.
[28:37.09]I don't know how to die.
[28:40.03]Drink empty enter window?
[28:42.96]Enter window?
[28:46.28]You cannot enter the window.
[28:47.62]Break window.

[30:19.78]I can't search because there is no... Look at how many times we have to do this.
[30:37.37]I'm not going to sit there anymore.
[30:40.59]We did every single word, and it didn't know half of them.
[30:47.18]We were on that one for like 20 minutes.
[30:48.52]That's enough time.
[30:50.36]Alright.
[30:51.24]We're back here.
[30:51.70]No, we're not.
[30:53.76]We should be back.

[31:29.28]Why can I not see the clicks?
[31:31.00]Oh, that's why.
[31:39.41]Okay.
[31:42.38]Looks like we got a lot of people that are clicking on the president one.
[31:53.25]I think that's gonna win by what I would just determine this to be a landslide.
[32:00.31]Here comes a politics stream.
[32:05.28]Sort of.
[32:06.60]Maybe.
[32:13.33]Alright, so we're going to call it there.

[35:52.38]Ready?
[35:55.12]You guys can't even see my answers.
[36:07.28]Alright.
[36:09.01]Rate the candidate's poise.
[36:11.17]Under intense pressure.
[36:13.51]Frequently puts foot in mouth.
[36:15.17]Sometimes slips, but not often.
[36:16.61]Extremely cool under fire.
[36:17.89]It's Gandalf.
[36:19.24]What state is the candidate from?
[36:22.89]Middle Earth.
[36:23.81]Is there an M-E?
[36:25.31]Yep.
[36:26.41]What state is the vice president from?
[36:30.89]Also from Middle Earth.
[36:34.35]What is the last name of the Republican candidate?
[36:39.63]No, I can't do that because that's making it evil.
[36:53.43]I don't know, fucking Homer Simpson.
[37:10.56]Candidate's personal magnetism.
[37:13.79]Easy to ignore.
[37:15.53]Average for a, eh, pretty average.
[37:17.81]Rate the candidates poised.
[37:19.37]Ah, yeah, sometimes you have a bit of an issue.
[37:21.04]What state is the candidate from?
[37:22.42]What, Springfield, Ohio?
[37:24.40]No, they never said it.
[37:24.98]They've never said it, ever, in the whole entire run of the whole show.
[37:32.72]It's not Illinois.
[37:36.49]Vice president is gonna be, I don't know, gonna be Marge?
[37:40.13]What is the last name of the third party candidate?
[37:42.43]Oh my God.
[37:45.13]Um... No, it's me.
[37:59.30]Let's get that candidate.
[38:00.64]How do you feel about all the... Right candidate speaking ability.
[38:08.95]I mean, we're talking about like an orator for the ages.
[38:13.68]Uh, right?
[38:14.18]Candidate's personal magnetism.
[38:15.76]A spellbinder.
[38:16.74]Absolutely irresistible.
[38:18.88]Candidate's poise.
[38:19.80]Extremely cool.
[38:20.78]Under five.
[38:21.24]Frequently puts foot in lock.
[38:22.78]What state is the candidate from?
[38:24.73]Well, would he like MA?
[38:27.31]What state is the vice president?
[38:28.33]Vice president is going to be... Um... Who's the vice president?
[38:38.19]Otto.
[38:38.55]Okay, so he's also from MA.
[38:41.35]Which party has been in power for the last four years?
[38:45.25]Well, let's just go for, like, let's go for, like, realism here.
[38:49.17]Is Homer Simpson the incumbent?
[38:50.73]Yes.
[38:52.71]What has the rate of inflation been for the past year?
[38:55.25]I don't know.
[39:02.39]Five?
[39:03.51]Six percent?
[39:04.59]Is it a percent?
[39:05.49]It's six.
[39:05.91]A hundred...
[39:14.55]That would be catastrophic.
[39:16.55]The party in office would certainly be thrown out.
[39:19.57]Yeah.
[39:20.21]If Homer Simpson was the president, we're going to do something more reasonable.
[39:29.14]Alright.
[39:30.20]Something high.
[39:32.60]Like 16%.
[39:34.52]That's fucking crazy.
[39:35.88]What is the latest unemployment figure?
[39:39.46]Well, if Homer Simpson is the president, let's say 94%.
[39:43.35]That would be catastrophic.
[39:45.61]Alright, reasonable.
[39:46.61]I don't know, what's like 68%, 50%, 49%, 45%, 30%, 29%, 28%, 20%.
[39:48.99]Okay, alright, so what is the current rate of GNP growth adjusted for inflation?
[40:20.57]Is the nation at peace or at war?
[40:22.67]We're at war.
[40:24.27]On a scale of 1 to 9, how would you describe the popularity of the war among the voters?
[40:31.05]I... I don't know.
[40:40.23]We're living in fucking hell right now.
[40:44.34]This is actual hell.
[40:46.70]Um...
[40:48.59]World War II?
[40:49.33]I don't know.
[40:50.04]Will Gandalf be managed by the computer?
[40:54.56]Yes.
[40:56.24]Will Homer Simpson be managed by the computer?
[40:59.41]Yes.
[41:00.25]Will Jerma N85 be managed by the computer?
[41:02.45]No.
[41:06.65]Okay, here we go.
[41:10.51]As of the last week, national polls reported the following average projections.
[41:14.95]Gandalf with 38% with 320 electoral votes.
[41:18.31]Homer Simpson with 30% and 81 electoral votes.
[41:21.84]And Germadine85 with 32% of the popular vote, but only 13 electoral colleges.
[41:27.38]Too close to call.
[41:28.98]There are 530 electoral votes of which 270 are needed to win.
[41:32.22]What do you mean that's too close to call?
[41:36.01]Oh, I see.
[41:36.95]Gandalf won already.
[41:42.85]Gandalf leaning or who's leaning Gandalf?
[41:46.71]Who's leaning me?
[41:51.01]Only my home state.
[41:52.29]That's it.
[41:54.95]Massachusetts is leaning me.
[41:59.26]Homer Simpson's got like the middle of America here.
[42:06.92]Gandalf.
[42:07.90]Okay, Nevada is leaning Homer Simpson.
[42:13.81]Alright, let's go.
[42:16.61]Ready to begin campaigning for the week of September 1st to the 7th, starting week one.
[42:20.34]Eight weeks to go.
[42:21.00]Alright, let's go.
[42:23.20]Economic news, economic indicators during the last month showed a modest weakening from the previous month.
[42:29.46]Foreign news, slightly favorable.
[42:32.07]At this time, all campaign staffs must decide whether or not their candidate will visit a foreign country during the campaign.
[42:38.54]Gandalf has decided to send the vice president to a friendly country during week four.
[42:43.75]The trip will last six days.
[42:45.97]Homer Simpson has decided not to take the trip.
[42:48.69]To the Jerma985 staff, do you want to take the trip?
[42:54.51]He sent Frodo to Mordor.
[42:56.91]Sure.
[42:58.09]To a friendly, neutral, or unfriendly country.
[43:00.67]Unfriendly.
[43:01.71]Send vice president or presidential candidate.
[43:05.75]Send the vice president.
[43:06.56]Let's send Otto.
[43:08.02]During which week?
[43:09.80]First week.
[43:12.26]For how many days?
[43:14.32]Cost in PAP 500 plus 50.
[43:18.92]Two days.
[43:21.25]On a scale of 1 to 100, indicate the quality of Jerma985's organization.
[43:25.11]The best would be 100.
[43:25.61]Anything under 75 might be unwise.
[43:30.21]I told you I'm a B plus streamer.
[43:35.25]What's my social, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:36.71]What's my social blade at right now?
[43:38.35]Somebody go check.
[43:39.55]What is my stream Twitch social blade?
[43:43.05]What is it?
[43:47.53]I think it's a B plus.
[43:55.67]There it is right there.
[43:56.37]B plus.
[43:58.58]Done.
[44:01.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:02.16]It just skipped.
[44:02.64]What is it?
[44:02.92]Why did it skip?
[44:08.03]Thank you, Concrete Car, for the five community subs.
[44:11.72]Thank you, Concrete.
[44:14.04]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[44:17.13]Five subs coming in here.
[44:18.93]Coming in hot.
[44:20.69]Alright, here we go.
[44:21.29]I gotta make some choices here.
[44:23.63]Political action points.
[44:24.93]I have 16,000 this week's overhead.
[44:27.01]Alright, wow, political points.
[44:29.15]National campaigning covers entire nation.
[44:32.23]States with more electoral votes will receive proportionately more coverage.
[44:36.94]How much should I spend on nation coverage?
[44:48.02]2,240.
[44:48.64]So I should go all in on the first week?
[44:51.90]That's probably a bad idea.
[44:58.13]Alright, here we go.
[44:58.61]New England.
[45:00.71]Gandalf, Homer Simpson, and me.
[45:02.67]I got Massachusetts.
[45:04.31]I'm pretty close to Connecticut.
[45:07.35]I'm close in Rhode Island.
[45:09.55]I'm losing in Maine.
[45:10.63]I'm losing... I got Vermont.
[45:14.51]Homer Simpson is not in this part of the country.
[45:17.71]Mid-Atlantic.
[45:23.44]Uh...
[45:25.58]I'm not winning in any of these.
[45:28.02]Why is Gandalf so popular?
[45:31.92]In the South.
[45:33.91]Nobody likes me down South.
[45:36.37]Holy shit.
[45:37.65]I have no fans down South.
[45:41.93]Everybody loves Gandalf.
[45:43.55]Around the whole country.
[45:50.12]Fifteen community subs just came in from Ampharic
[45:54.72]Thank you.
[45:55.95]That's a lot.
[45:57.31]Big 15 sub drop here.
[46:00.77]Thank you so much.
[46:06.11]Congratulations to all the people that just got the subs.
[46:08.83]15 of them just came in.
[46:10.02]Thank you so much, Ampharic.
[46:13.84]I have no fans, though.
[46:14.92]I mean, Wisconsin, but Gandalf is winning everything.
[46:19.96]How do we, like, smear campaign Gandalf?
[46:23.91]I got it.
[46:25.60]You went into the middle of nowhere to get a couple of hobbits to go do a fucking mission for you?
[46:31.46]You couldn't just do it yourself?
[46:33.54]They were children, by the way.
[46:39.76]Homer Simpson's got Missouri.
[46:42.00]I got Oklahoma, though.
[46:43.36]Those Oklahomans.
[46:53.20]New Mexico?
[46:53.88]Close.
[46:55.32]Nevada?
[46:56.52]Great state of Nevada?
[46:58.62]Close?
[47:04.39]California.
[47:05.37]Californians love Gandalf.
[47:09.11]Not going to be able to do anything.
[47:11.07]Gandalf refuses to debate.
[47:14.23]Homer Simpson is calling for a debate anytime, anywhere.
[47:16.52]Does Jerma985 wish to debate?
[47:18.00]Yes, I do.
[47:20.71]Do Homer Simpson and Jerma985 agree to a debate at this time?
[47:23.51]Of course we do.
[47:24.41]The candidates have agreed that Gandalf's going to go do his own thing.
[47:28.27]How many questions will be asked during this debate?
[47:30.72]I'll knock them all out of the park.
[47:34.90]The candidates are ready to begin.
[47:37.28]By the luck of the draw, candidate Homer Simpson will answer first.

[47:55.53]Enter the percent of time the candidate will allocate to each line of argument.
[48:00.81]What?
[48:03.41]Hold on, so he... 4% discussed irrelevant considerations, spent half the time stating his own position, spent 19% of the time contrasting position with me,

[48:55.65]No criticizing with witticisms.
[48:59.76]Spend a little bit of time killing time.
[49:01.24]Implying opponent is uninformed.
[49:04.94]Criticize with moral indignation, okay?
[49:09.69]My turn.
[49:24.30]That was just a, you're wrong.
[49:26.74]How should the United States deal with illegal immigration?
[49:41.17]How should the United States deal with, okay, kill time.
[49:43.99]Homer Simpson did the same thing.
[49:51.89]So both candidates don't want to do that.
[49:58.14]Okay.
[50:00.00]My turn.
[50:02.14]Let's clarify our position a little bit here.
[50:05.56]Clarify.
[50:08.29]And then I'm going to give 10% here.
[50:09.79]30% here.
[50:11.99]I'm going to criticize with some, I guess... Is this a new question?
[50:17.99]We're going to imply that... Not imply at all that they're uninformed, but we're going to do some moving around.
[50:22.51]30, 10, 30, 30.
[50:23.05]Oh, fuck.
[50:26.28]I got him against the ropes.
[50:30.36]Dark Soul, thanks for the five community subs.
[50:32.46]Dark Soul 115.
[50:33.30]That's a lot of subs tonight, yeah.
[50:36.48]So Homer is doing like the joke I did in the very beginning.
[50:40.85]He's fucked.
[50:42.31]He's just killing time.
[50:43.17]His eyes are darting back and forth.
[50:46.25]Don't!
[50:46.75]And then everyone laughs and he gets the votes back.
[50:50.89]Are you in support of affirmative actions and programs as a means of bringing minorities and women into the mainstream of the American economy?
[50:58.33]Uh, okay, yeah, so enter the percent of time they can enter.
[51:05.26]Uh, let's discuss relevant considerations.
[51:07.76]Let's give that about, let's give that a, let's give that like 30%.
[51:11.82]We'll go with the 25% here.
[51:14.96]Uh, contrast position with opponents.
[51:17.06]I'm gonna give that, um, I'm gonna give that 10%.
[51:19.96]I'm gonna go with like 40% here.
[51:21.36]Oh, fuck.
[51:21.64]I went over.
[51:26.96]How do I go?
[51:27.40]Oh, I don't go back.
[51:28.38]I went over.
[51:29.08]Did I do minus five?
[51:35.15]Zero?
[51:35.53]I did 105%.
[51:55.61]Candidate tried to exceed time on that last reply and had to be cut off.
[51:59.60]Time has been redistributed so the sum of all five lines does equal 100%.
[52:03.32]Homer Simpson, he's just killing time.
[52:10.96]40% emphasis on your own position.
[52:13.94]41 kill time.
[52:16.83]You are fucked.
[52:19.78]Oh, now you're just killing time.
[52:21.34]Let me give you a 30% on my position.
[52:24.85]Here you go.
[52:26.63]40% on criticizing you.
[52:29.29]Don't need to do that one.
[52:30.59]And then, incredibly uninformed.
[52:32.89]Let's go 30% here.
[52:33.67]Not going to kill any time.
[52:35.89]Right now, I'm beating him.
[52:36.97]Like Muhammad Ali did.
[52:38.39]What?
[52:48.42]Jerma985 has committed a gaffe.
[52:51.27]The questionnaires are looking at each other in amazement.
[52:55.35]What was the gaffe?
[52:59.37]What did I do?
[52:59.95]Am I miked up right now?
[53:02.84]Did they hear what I was saying?
[53:05.18]Are you in favor of tariffs as a means of protecting domestic industries?
[53:13.54]Uh, fucking gaff.
[53:17.11]He gaffed.
[53:17.73]How did I gaff?
[53:19.23]State own position.
[53:22.55]10%.
[53:23.09]Contrast position with opponents, 10%.
[53:25.17]I'm going to back off here.
[53:26.37]Let's go with like 8% and then like 4%.
[53:30.29]I'm backing off.
[53:30.85]I'm just going to kill some time.
[53:32.03]I'm going to get my breath.
[53:43.29]Don't be a gaffe.
[53:46.01]Alright.
[53:48.03]Are you in favor of tariffs as a means of protecting domestic industries?
[53:51.57]No.
[53:53.03]That's a pretty good question for Homer Simpson.
[53:54.89]He didn't really dodge it.
[53:55.81]I did.
[53:56.11]I just wanted to back off a little bit.
[53:57.42]I just had a big gaffe.
[54:02.72]I'm going to clarify.
[54:03.80]We're going to go like 58% clear.
[54:05.98]No.
[54:06.66]Round numbers because I'm stupid.
[54:08.02]We're going to do 60% emphasis clarifying my position.
[54:11.18]I backed off a little.
[54:13.26]I don't need very much criticisms here.
[54:16.12]I'm not going to imply that they're uninformed.
[54:17.52]Maybe 5%.
[54:18.32]And then we'll kill a little bit of time.
[54:19.80]We'll just kill a little bit.
[54:28.11]See?
[54:28.25]50%.
[54:28.33]Now, hold on a minute.
[54:29.69]Let me clarify.
[54:30.89]Excuse me.
[54:34.84]What measures would you take to correct the adverse trends in our balance of trade?
[54:40.46]He had a lot of responses here.
[54:46.40]18% discussed relevant considerations.
[54:48.33]39, 36.
[54:49.67]So he wants to know.
[54:50.59]He's contrasting his positions with mine.
[54:53.89]I'm going after him here.
[54:55.61]Yeah, I'm going after him.
[54:57.46]20%.
[54:58.14]Give you a pin.
[54:58.74]Okay, 30, 20.
[54:59.02]20%, 20%.
[54:59.08]40%.
[54:59.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[55:05.32]ten percent and then fifty percent I'm going after him Jerma has committed a serious gaffe the panel is aghast how unfortunate what do I keep doing what am I doing
[55:35.65]62% clarifying, 22% criticize morally, kill time.
[55:41.99]You're not gonna make any gaffes with like 60%?
[55:46.48]I'm clarifying everything now.
[55:48.86]Clarify, clarify, clarify, clarify.
[55:54.08]What about your policy on nuclear power?
[56:03.89]I don't know.
[56:05.41]I'm not going to gaff.
[56:07.27]Discuss relevant... Let's talk about the relevancy of nuclear.
[56:11.22]State your own position on nuclear.
[56:12.58]Let's go with like 45%.
[56:15.12]Let's state my own position.
[56:16.34]I'm going to be clear here.
[56:18.52]Maybe a little bit of contrasting.
[56:21.04]Not going to attack very much.
[56:22.41]Maybe like 5%.
[56:23.09]No, no, no.
[56:23.97]Like 5%.
[56:25.53]And then we'll spend 20% just kind of moving around and doing some anecdotes.
[56:28.37]I need to start clearing up my shit here.
[56:31.39]Yeah, see?
[56:31.73]They did the same thing.
[56:35.38]My turn.
[56:35.82]Alright.
[56:36.24]Clarify my position again.
[56:37.28]We're going to go hard here.
[56:38.36]No, no, no.
[56:38.68]We're going to go like 45.
[56:40.64]We're going to go like 15 with some criticisms.
[56:43.79]Another like 15.
[56:44.29]I'm going to criticize.
[56:46.29]I'm not going to imply that they're uninformed.
[56:48.05]And we're going to kill a little bit more time here.
[56:53.87]Besides my serious gaffes, I've got them against the ropes.
[56:57.86]In the opinion of the press, the debate went as follows.
[57:04.50]Homer Simpson...
[57:08.05]17, 16, Jerma985, 9, and 2.
[57:10.09]Fuck.
[57:26.44]Nobody else.
[57:27.72]I just have Massachusetts.
[57:30.12]Nobody else likes me.
[57:32.41]God damn it.
[57:34.78]Uh, begin campaigning starting week two.
[57:41.98]Questionable statements.
[57:42.94]Homer Simpson had a questionable statement.
[57:44.66]What'd he do?
[57:48.22]Jerma985's running mate was abroad for two days last week and received mixed reviews.
[57:53.35]Campaign officials are accepting this philosophically, but in any event, it appears the trip will have very little impact on the campaign.
[58:00.07]It's because Otto's a dog and he just walked around and looked cute.
[58:05.13]I'm gonna do two thousand save some of these points covers all states in a region with uh spending alright new England I'm going all in in new England because it's the only place that they like me mid-atlantic 250 it's the south 300 industrial midwest 200 midwest 400.
[58:33.76]West?
[58:35.54]450.
[58:38.06]Pacific coast.
[58:39.58]400.
[58:40.90]Oh, this has to be 2,000.
[58:47.45]I thought... No, no, no.
[58:48.15]I thought this was like a scale of how you want... I didn't know it was like literal.
[58:54.81]So I have 62?
[58:58.68]What the fuck? 15,500.
[59:05.56]5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35.
[59:13.15]And then I want... Dermot gave my phone a virus.
[59:22.84]I did not do that.
[59:24.34]You were downloading something.
[59:25.62]You were downloading something and you got caught with a virus.
[59:28.86]I didn't do it.
[59:31.90]Literally a worse politician than Homer Simpson.
[59:34.56]No, I'm not.
[59:35.56]I'm not a worse politician.
[59:40.68]We're going to do 20.
[59:42.73]I want the Pacific Coast as mine.
[59:47.15]I'm going to do 15.
[59:50.57]I can do 17.
[59:56.02]I feel like I want to just fail this.
[59:58.60]Because I don't want... whatever.
[60:03.36]Alright.
[60:04.20]I went up in Massachusetts.
[60:11.95]140.
[60:12.53]Gandalf is losing the Mid-Atlantic in favor of Homer Simpson.
[60:19.89]No, they're south.
[60:20.73]They're down south.
[60:22.41]It's too far out of reach.
[60:24.93]And I'm a fucking third party candidate.
[60:27.55]I just by default get like 5% of the vote.
[60:31.15]That's what's going on here.
[60:34.25]It's going up in all these other states.
[60:43.90]No, none of them.
[60:44.82]I'm not going to win.
[60:47.50]Oh, wait a minute.
[60:48.36]Hold on.
[60:48.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[60:49.48]California is huge.
[60:52.38]California is like the most important.
[60:55.47]It's like the biggest one.
[60:56.47]Holy shit.
[60:57.07]I might win if I do this right.
[61:01.19]And I got Hawaii.
[61:03.81]And I got Oregon.
[61:05.09]And I got Washington.
[61:05.93]I got the whole Pacific Coast.
[61:10.03]Gandalf refuses to debate.
[61:11.31]No, I'm not debating.
[61:12.17]I don't want to debate anybody.
[61:13.03]I'm not going to have any more serious gaffes.
[61:20.54]Gandalf.
[61:21.30]Alright, I've got 13 there.
[61:22.64]Alright.
[61:25.92]Anybody leaning towards my way?
[61:36.93]Yes, let's go.
[61:38.51]Okay.
[61:39.59]The latest monthly consumer price index showed an increase of 1.7%.
[61:42.91]The rate of inflation for the past six months is now 17.7%.
[61:47.66]Somewhat unfavorable news.
[61:50.26]I would think so.
[61:54.78]Okay.
[61:56.28]National campaigning.
[61:57.90]Covers entire nations.
[61:58.78]States will... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:00.22]Amount to spend.
[62:00.98]I want to spend it all.
[62:01.82]1867.
[62:02.10]Go all in.
[62:08.28]Massachusetts got it locked in.
[62:09.92]Except Homer Simpson.
[62:11.08]Fuck off.
[62:13.10]I got Maine.
[62:20.53]I got Jersey.
[62:23.03]I got Maryland.
[62:25.51]I'm tied with Delaware.
[62:28.07]So how come when we go to the map, why do I only have Massachusetts?
[62:36.22]80, Florida, no.
[62:39.06]43, 52, no.
[62:40.10]When we get to the industrial Midwest, I lose everything.
[62:42.28]I'm not going to get it.
[62:43.68]The Midwest is a toss-up here.
[62:46.67]I got Kansas.
[62:50.23]The West.
[62:52.25]Homer Simpson's got Nevada.
[62:56.59]Pacific Coast.
[62:58.25]I lost it again.
[63:03.09]Gandalf?
[63:03.57]I'm gonna go the... No, no, no.
[63:05.01]I have to debate.
[63:06.37]I gotta debate next week.
[63:09.33]God damn it.
[63:12.17]How do I get another state?
[63:15.21]Third party is hard mode.
[63:16.65]Yeah, why did I do third party?
[63:23.56]Unemployment was 20%.
[63:28.68]Alright, let's debate.
[63:29.48]I'm going for it. 1661.
[63:33.77]I'm spending all my money, but I gotta get a debate in here.
[63:37.01]I have to win some points.
[63:46.06]My only hope is they got California Hail Mary.
[63:51.36]No.
[63:51.78]Gandalf is locking it in.
[63:56.36]Let's go.
[63:56.96]Debate.
[63:57.34]Let's go.
[64:00.29]How many questions would that be?
[64:01.39]Let's do three questions.
[64:05.26]Homer Simpson will answer first.
[64:08.40]Do you intend to follow an environmental policy that will be more or less restrictive on business?
[64:14.58]Homer Simpson says he's going to state his side and he's going to contrast it with mine.
[64:19.90]So we have a very different opinion, apparently.
[64:23.94]We're going to go 20%.
[64:24.42]I'm going to state 30% of my opinions.
[64:28.53]Contrast it about 25%.
[64:30.88]I'm going to say your policies are a little weird.
[64:33.22]I don't know.
[64:33.54]I don't like your policies.
[64:34.43]I'm going to go just kill time.
[64:36.37]That's pretty balanced.
[64:39.47]Now he's clarifying his position and he's killing time.
[64:42.25]He's not criticizing me which means he knows he's wrong.
[64:45.95]Okay.
[64:47.50]So I'm going to clarify mine again and then we're going to criticize.
[64:54.08]So let's get a real good like 35% clarification.
[64:56.04]10% here.
[65:00.92]25% here.
[65:03.74]You're a little bit uninformed on this.
[65:05.64]15% here and then we'll do a little bit of time killing.
[65:08.52]I think that's pretty good.
[65:10.16]What did I do?
[65:13.77]What?
[65:14.87]How is this a gaff?
[65:27.24]What did I gaff?
[65:32.24]You kept Clara... I didn't wear pants to the debate.
[65:35.40]Yeah, I'm at the podium.
[65:42.30]And that's why I think our environment is incredibly important to protect.
[65:45.89]Like, cheering, cheering, yeah.
[65:47.57]I think that we need to be very, very careful with how we do and deal with new industries.
[65:52.09]And I take a little step to the side right of the podium.
[65:55.63]And I also believe I don't have any pants on.
[65:58.15]Oh, what the... I think that we need to be on point here.
[66:02.25]with every part of our environmental lifestyles.
[66:08.14]And I look down and I'm like, what the fuck?
[66:09.92]And I like put both hands down, like that's going to help, like covering me.
[66:13.02]Oh, I'm like covering, even though it doesn't do anything.
[66:15.52]And like I tilt my knees in.
[66:17.12]Oh, oh, oh.
[66:18.12]And I go back, like right, left, left, left, left, left, left over to the podium.
[66:31.06]Stupid.
[66:32.96]Alright, am I in favor of changes?
[66:37.30]Discuss relevant considerations.
[66:41.32]Uh, no, let's go... Contrast, and then attack, and then we'll kill some time.
[66:54.79]I'm contrasting and I'm attacking.
[66:56.09]This is a gaffe.
[66:57.89]Okay.
[67:00.68]So now he has to stay at his own positions.
[67:03.74]And he's killing time.
[67:06.51]So I should now... I should now criticize, or I should imply that they're uninformed.
[67:18.65]Because, like, oh, you're just wrong.
[67:20.23]Everything you just said was wrong, and I've already clarified mine, and you just spent that time clarifying, so you're wrong.
[67:28.22]Let's go with... I already did this, like,
[67:33.05]15% emphasis.
[67:36.73]I'm not going to criticize.
[67:40.70]Let's go with like... 5%.
[67:41.38]5%.
[67:47.80]Implied that they're uninformed.
[67:54.68]50%.
[67:54.90]Like, no, is that going to be a gaffe?
[67:57.85]40%.
[67:58.41]And then we'll just kill around...
[68:02.09]That's a lot of time killing, though.
[68:07.50]That's too much time killing.
[68:13.72]No, it wasn't.
[68:14.90]Okay.
[68:16.91]Clarifying.
[68:18.59]He's saying that I'm uninformed, and he's killing time.
[68:23.25]Alright, well, I think I've won that one.
[68:25.63]No gaff, and look at how fucked up he is right here.
[68:29.49]What thoughts do you have on the situation in South Africa and to what degree should we press our objections?
[68:35.09]He's like, I don't know, I don't know.
[68:36.87]I should just run over there and just shove him.
[68:42.37]Because he didn't take a step to his left.
[68:43.75]He's naked too.
[68:46.70]I'm the only one that can see that.
[68:48.24]So, you know, I should do it.
[68:52.54]Alright, so now I'm going to say...
[68:55.60]Discuss relevant considerations.
[68:56.98]State my positions.
[68:58.44]Bang.
[68:58.94]Contrast positions with opponents and attack.
[69:05.87]Watch this one.
[69:06.31]Ready?
[69:06.49]25%.
[69:07.95]Contrast.
[69:08.63]We're going to go... Let's see.
[69:13.75]25% state my opinions.
[69:15.23]At least one of these has to be big.
[69:17.89]Attack opponent's position probably has to be... I'm trying to think of points-wise.
[69:24.40]Probably 30%.
[69:29.85]30, 30, 10.
[69:31.17]Or 30, 40, 0.
[69:36.98]Oh, no!
[69:37.62]God damn it!
[69:38.52]I... I forgot I did 20 on the first one.
[69:48.68]The one before.
[69:49.34]God damn it.
[69:50.14]Whatever.
[69:50.48]I got my point across.
[69:51.78]C's fucked up anyways.
[69:55.16]I...
[69:59.89]Now he's gonna clarify, and he's implying that I'm informed.
[70:03.25]And you're killing time.
[70:04.10]Okay, well... Now I don't have a shirt on.
[70:10.84]Clarify own positions!
[70:14.53]That was an actual gaffe.
[70:16.95]I thought I did like 10 for some reason.
[70:18.55]I was just going too fast.
[70:27.84]Strip debating.
[70:38.65]Alright, I'm not gonna criticize.
[70:40.55]I'm gonna... Maybe morals.
[70:45.15]We'll do 10.
[70:45.77]10.
[70:47.87]And then we'll do like 60.
[70:49.93]Or 50 and then 20.
[70:50.79]Or 40.
[70:50.97]No, no, no.
[70:51.45]40 and 30.
[70:56.72]This is not gonna be a gaff.
[70:59.14]I came fucking close to on the points.
[71:01.46]God damn it.
[71:03.92]What's this intangibles bullshit?
[71:10.24]How, a 20 to six?
[71:21.50]Fucking playing on third party mode.
[71:23.20]I should've just picked like the Democrat.
[71:24.81]I would've gotten three points.
[71:27.37]I should have picked Republican.
[71:28.35]I would have got like three points already.
[71:31.61]I'm starting with my ass against the wall.
[71:42.21]Gandalf's running mate was abroad for six days last week and received good press.
[71:48.47]They're very pleased.
[71:50.75]I'm almost out of money too.
[71:59.34]I have to go.
[71:59.92]I mean... I'm not gonna win.
[72:02.90]It's not possible.
[72:05.24]I'm not gonna win.
[72:05.98]There's no way I can win.
[72:15.68]Why are these all so close?
[72:16.82]I gotta release a catchy tune.
[72:23.14]Gandalf always refuses to debate.
[72:27.00]I seriously should have listened.
[72:29.10]Oh, I dropped.
[72:29.94]I have... Oh, no.
[72:36.30]My own state left me.
[72:40.73]They went to Gandalf.
[72:42.71]I was naked too many times on stage.
[72:55.05]At this point, you drop out, you know?
[72:56.73]It's like, I concede to my fellow candidates that I wasn't up to the task of running our nation, or apparently... I gotta get one state.
[73:16.63]Oh!
[73:17.87]Gandalf says a debate may be possible this week if the staff can agree on a time.
[73:22.97]Let's, all three of us.
[73:25.80]Do all three candidates agree to debate each other simultaneously?
[73:29.14]Yeah.
[73:30.76]Okay, here comes the big debate.
[73:32.08]I'm supposed to be dropped out.
[73:34.24]Only two questions.
[73:37.38]Homer Simpson always gets to go first by luck of the draw bullshit.
[73:40.81]He's like stuff in the ballot box.
[73:43.15]He's stuff in the ballot box.
[73:53.13]Homer Simpson, do you believe... You know what?
[73:55.39]Because I've already lost, I'm just going to act like a fucking idiot.
[73:59.93]I'm going to attack everybody and kill time every question.
[74:06.04]I've already lost.
[74:07.46]I'm just up there because I'm rich.
[74:09.56]And I can keep blowing money.
[74:10.98]I can keep burning money.
[74:13.54]I have no states.
[74:14.96]I have no votes.
[74:17.02]I'm just the other guy that's there being annoying at this point.
[74:20.28]And I'm going to go fully nude.
[74:23.56]I'm not going to be embarrassed this time.
[74:24.72]I'm going to own it.
[74:26.86]I'm going for it.
[74:27.38]Here we go.
[74:29.75]Do you believe our foreign and domestic competitiveness has been hurt by recent merger and acquisition activity in the private sector?
[74:36.43]Oh, yeah.
[74:36.71]How about this one?
[74:37.85]Yeah, fucking who gives a shit?
[74:40.08]State-owned position.
[74:42.54]I'm smoking a cigarette on stage now.
[74:45.38]Yeah, who gives a fuck?
[74:47.42]By the way, he sucks.
[74:51.52]He's dumb.
[74:52.04]His TV show went on for way too many seasons to a point where it's just sad now.
[74:59.60]Gandalf, do you believe our foreign and domestic competitiveness has been, you know, like the same question to you?
[75:05.92]I think that, yes.
[75:07.48]All these statewide position others.
[75:10.18]Great.
[75:12.61]Homer Simpson's killing time now.
[75:13.81]That's fine.
[75:14.43]Hey, Gandalf!
[75:17.01]Hey, Gandalf!
[75:25.15]Really made that big blunder.
[75:28.27]Sending everybody into the goblin town, didn't you?
[75:31.01]That was a real stupid idea.
[75:35.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[75:41.71]Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, say it, say it.
[75:46.37]Everyone's booing me.
[75:47.15]Look at this, look at me.
[75:52.75]And like they have to fucking sit me down.
[75:54.45]Yeah, yeah, I'll sit down.
[76:01.61]And I'm like kind of freaking everybody up.
[76:07.53]60% emphasis.
[76:09.43]Well, my opponent is really just, these circumstances are just a little too much for me to handle.
[76:17.83]I'm going to just say that we should be more nice to each other.
[76:24.07]What is your stand on the death penalty?
[76:25.65]Do you feel our criminal justice system is overly lenient?
[76:29.30]Well, I think that it's possible we could have two different debates and figure out what this could be.
[76:34.16]And I think this is exactly how I believe.
[76:37.32]Yeah, I think that is... I don't really like this question part.
[76:42.00]So maybe if you get... Oh, yeah, I maybe move on to a new question.
[76:48.25]I think we should kill them both!
[76:50.97]Both of these clowns.
[76:52.85]Right now.
[76:53.55]How's that for a position?
[76:54.81]Yeah.
[76:55.57]Yeah.
[77:05.32]We're not even real characters.
[77:07.06]We're all fictional.
[77:15.43]I think that you are out of your mind.
[77:23.41]Legalize meth.
[77:34.20]Emphasizing my current positions.
[77:37.78]Homer Simpson is really, really distraught over this one.
[77:45.59]My pony doesn't understand, Bart.
[77:48.47]It wear cartoon characters.
[77:52.71]So we can't die anyways.
[77:55.72]They used to die in Tom and Jerry every episode.
[78:02.72]I love Tom and Jerry.
[78:03.74]It was my favorite TV show.
[78:09.58]I especially liked it when they used to hit each other with hammers on the head.
[78:16.23]When I was a kid, I used to laugh at it.
[78:25.70]That is 13.
[78:26.18]I'm probably going to get removed.
[78:34.31]I'm going to get removed.
[78:35.97]How did Homer Simpson win again?
[78:44.77]Unfortunately, it has been... I got 22% of the popular vote, though.
[78:50.56]People are still voting for me.
[78:59.37]Across the country, there's a bunch of just like sickos.
[79:03.25]Hey, let's vote.
[79:03.85]Yeah, I like what he's doing up there.
[79:08.32]I like when he talks shit to Gandalf.
[79:12.56]I love his position on Tom and Jerry cartoons.
[79:16.20]Ah, fuck the other candidates.
[79:24.58]Alright, only two weeks to go.
[79:26.57]We have to see this through.
[79:27.65]Inflation increased by 2%.
[79:29.89]That's so bad.
[79:38.97]Gandalf had a questionable statement.
[79:41.81]Probably because he was talking about me.
[79:46.69]I don't want to be on stage with that maniac anymore.
[79:51.23]He's purely uninformed and possibly insane.
[79:58.31]Oh boy, I dropped out big time here.
[80:04.55]I know what it's like to deal with maniacs.
[80:07.47]Sauron, Saruman, all of them.
[80:12.34]He reminds me of them when they were younger.
[80:19.80]He may as well change his name to Smurma, because all bad guys' names start with an S and end with an O-N.
[80:29.78]He should be Smuron.
[80:43.47]Holy fuck, I'm losing bad.
[80:48.36]How did Homer Simpson... This looks like... This is just a fucking... Like, you hold down tab in an online game.
[80:57.61]Homer Simpson just doing too good to a point where, like, you don't want them in the server anymore.
[81:01.35]You know what I mean?
[81:04.75]You ever, like, hold down tab and you just, like, got 315 points.
[81:07.64]Okay, I'm going somewhere else.
[81:14.12]North Dakota and South Dakota both do not like me at all.
[81:25.14]Who does this even bad?
[81:27.54]It's 408.
[81:29.02]What happened?
[81:32.30]Do I wish to debate?
[81:36.11]Gandalf doesn't want to debate.
[81:37.65]I'm not debating.
[81:38.31]This is the last week.
[81:47.01]One week to go.
[81:47.83]Unemployment was 20%.
[81:54.05]Gaffs committed Homer Simpson.
[81:55.67]They're like, I've... I kind of like detonated the space here.
[81:59.69]Like I said a bunch of crazy shit and now they're like backpedaling, stepping forward, making like gaffs and questionable statements.
[82:06.59]I'm really like... Homer committed a gaff.
[82:14.60]Alright.
[82:15.76]So I got eight.
[82:16.40]Yeah, spend it all.
[82:17.74]Who cares?
[82:19.90]I'm just doing this for fun.
[82:22.32]Massachusetts, 120 points.
[82:23.48]Yeah, I remember when I had Massachusetts.
[82:28.28]They all thought I was awesome.
[82:31.65]And then I read in the newspaper I was naked five times on stage.
[82:38.09]And all those broods didn't like it.
[82:50.30]They all said I should put the clothes on.
[82:52.42]I said, meh.
[82:56.25]During the interview, Jerma985 was also nude.
[82:59.83]Why is it I should have to do that?
[83:15.17]Ed Big Head.
[83:17.57]No, no, you're talking about the other Big Head.
[83:20.13]Big Head!
[83:21.13]That's Ed Big Head.
[83:24.48]Big Head's wife was... What was Big Head's wife's name?
[83:33.49]Bev.
[83:34.23]Yeah, that's Bev Big Head.
[83:37.95]Is unwilling to debate at this time.
[83:41.15]I'm just gonna take the loss and leave.
[83:46.32]No, I don't even want to debate.
[83:48.76]I'm done.
[83:50.73]I give up.
[83:52.71]I'm not debating anymore.
[83:54.59]I'm taking the loss.
[84:00.21]This is the final week.
[84:02.57]Good news.
[84:05.65]Economic indicators are up.
[84:08.09]Yeah, whatever.
[84:08.87]Spend the last $6.56.
[84:09.29]Not like I care.
[84:15.73]Apparently the people of Maine and Rhode Island also do not care.
[84:21.87]Because I have almost 33% of the vote for this week, polling-wise.
[84:31.56]Here's the final debate.
[84:32.30]This is the last, the presidential debate.
[84:38.80]Unwilling is, why would you be unwilling to, yeah, let's go.
[84:43.11]Let's go.
[84:43.59]Yeah, the guy that's running everything, the guy that's winning everything.
[84:48.43]One question.
[84:50.15]Two questions.
[84:50.71]I can only... Two questions.
[84:53.49]Okay, I get to answer first.
[84:59.03]What's this?
[84:59.35]This is interesting.
[85:01.55]Everyone's kind of sitting in their seats right now, looking in sort of confusion.
[85:06.79]Jerma985 has come on stage in a suit with styled hair.
[85:13.70]And looks like he had some work.
[85:15.14]He had, like, green teeth last time.
[85:17.26]Looks like he had some work done on his teeth.
[85:20.88]And he smells considerably better.
[85:22.44]And people are a little concerned about this.
[85:24.20]He's just normal.
[85:26.36]He gets the first question.
[85:27.38]He comes on stage, and he's very just relaxed.
[85:32.51]We can begin the debate now.
[85:35.03]Mr. Elbertson, given recent demographic trends, what is the likelihood of your administration proposing a return to selective service system?
[85:54.28]Well, on further positioning and moving my name around and looking at the facts,
[86:07.53]and trying to find out what is real and what isn't and all of us have different things and different opinions that we all care about and decide that is important and every single day we come together as a group of not not this person this person but as americans
[86:32.11]to gaze upon the beauty of my body!
[86:36.31]Oh, goddammit!
[86:37.15]He ripped his clothes off!
[86:38.47]He fuckin' drip-painted us!
[86:41.66]Goddammit!
[86:42.60]He did it again!
[86:46.20]Yeah!
[86:48.40]Get the fuckin' cops in here!
[86:49.62]I don't care!
[86:52.62]Hey!
[86:53.16]Hey!
[86:54.91]Get off me!
[86:55.93]I don't care if I fuckin' lose!
[86:59.32]Get off!
[87:00.68]I'll rip your head off!
[87:02.73]I'll kill him!
[87:04.61]Get in the car!
[87:09.97]I'm not going down without a fight!
[87:43.26]So who won?
[87:48.16]Silence.
[87:49.73]Gandalf gets the most... Okay, it was hard not to laugh at that.
[87:52.61]Because it said, Gandalf seems to have come out the most from this debate.
[87:56.95]He committed a gaffe.
[88:02.96]He probably was like, fuck you.
[88:04.76]No, I can't say that on TV.
[88:10.00]Project next state, okay.
[88:13.22]So what state is this?
[88:17.21]Ooh, ooh, holy shit!
[88:21.35]I got 634,000 votes!
[88:40.01]Let's just go to the final.
[88:41.31]Fuck this.
[88:44.42]Did I get any states?
[88:48.78]No, I don't think so.
[88:55.18]And the results are in.
[88:57.15]Ladies and gentlemen, your newest president of the United States of America.
[89:05.31]Please welcome to the stage
[89:09.71]Gandalf.
[89:19.61]He wins in a landslide.
[89:22.54]That's so fucking ridiculous.
[89:30.70]Chairman I-95 was last seen being taken to the local penitentiary.
[89:42.50]He said in the back of the squad car, if you let me just open the door and fall out on the highway, pretending, and this is a direct quote, pretending that I escaped, I will deposit a hundred grand into both of your bank accounts.
[90:07.43]He now awaits trial.
[90:16.53]Look at this map.
[90:18.91]There's, like, never been a map like this.
[90:21.21]I think this has happened, like, twice in history.
[90:32.72]You got a fully, fully red, a fully red west and east coast.
[90:39.37]And the middle is blue.
[90:42.95]That very, that doesn't ever happen.
[90:56.47]The colors have flipped.
[90:57.29]No, Homer Simpson was the Democrat, wasn't he?
[91:01.19]Wait, what?
[91:04.41]No, red was... Was Homer Republican?
[91:11.42]Wait, hold on.
[91:12.58]I get invited to the inauguration?
[91:17.46]Why would they do blue Republican and red Democrat?
[91:22.53]That...
[91:24.30]That's been like that for, like, hundreds of years.
[91:26.80]Alright, I get to go to the inauguration.
[91:29.86]I'm in, like, cuffs and, like, an orange suit.
[91:33.30]See president.
[91:34.42]Oh.
[91:41.44]There it is.
[91:42.54]It's time to move on to the next one.
[91:46.60]It's been like that for millions of years.
[91:49.52]That was President Elect, 1988 edition.
[92:04.09]So where to now?
[92:05.87]This is incorrect though.
[92:06.67]This needs to be like this.
[92:08.97]There we go.
[92:10.56]So we were down here.
[92:15.70]You've been invited to the inauguration and with a pair of clothes.
[92:26.36]So it was down here, right here somewhere.
[92:30.12]Right here.
[92:30.42]Alright.
[92:31.42]We've got one more from this list.
[92:40.57]You'll be able to click in just a second.
[92:44.41]Here we go.
[92:44.75]Remember, you have to be able to see the text.
[92:51.40]I'm not doing Leisure Suit Larry.
[92:55.86]No, no.
[93:04.84]Go again.
[93:07.88]It's not a porn game.
[93:10.05]It is the original porn game.
[93:13.05]It's the porn game to create all porn games.
[93:16.94]It's the one that they based all the other porn games off of.
[93:20.22]Every porn game that you've played in the last 10 years is because of the porn game that was Leisure Suit Larry porn game.
[93:42.34]Alright, you ready?
[93:43.36]Ready for this?
[93:45.66]All you guys want are your porn games.
[93:53.87]Stop saying porn game.
[93:58.52]Well, sorry guys.
[94:03.40]Can't play it.
[94:04.44]I tried.
[94:04.96]I clicked it.
[94:14.00]I'll try it again.
[94:15.96]I'll click it one more time.
[94:16.84]We'll see.
[94:23.40]Leisure Suit Larry.
[94:26.87]Land of the Lounge Lizards.
[94:29.23]For total transparency, look.
[94:36.41]God damn it.
[94:38.29]It actually fucking worked.
[94:56.47]First sound in an hour and a half.
[95:06.29]Okay.
[95:07.03]Oh.
[95:07.57]Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards contains some elements of plot which may not be suitable or may not be appropriate for children.
[95:15.85]No, how old are you?
[95:17.49]Oh, okay.
[95:18.75]Oh, it's not a porn game!
[95:20.27]We just have a click, an age verification click thing.
[95:25.19]It's not a porn game, though.
[95:28.74]Hey, look, I still get to click this one.
[95:36.30]Yeah, sure you are.
[95:37.54]To verify your age, please answer the five simple questions.
[95:41.38]Ah, who lost a daughter but gained a meathead?
[95:43.66]I don't fucking know.
[95:51.02]I don't know what this is.
[95:51.82]I don't... Which U.S.
[95:57.32]And there's like boobs back...
[96:00.49]No, that's just like a shirt on.
[96:01.83]Which U.S.
[96:02.31]Secretary of State was born in Germany?
[96:10.72]Who was the inventive genius behind the Apple computer?
[96:15.08]That's Steve Wozniak.
[96:19.66]Close Encounters of the Third Kind is about... Is it creatures from outer space?
[96:27.37]Yes.
[96:29.70]IBM stands for Itsy Bitsy Men.
[96:34.91]It's International Business Machines.
[96:38.61]And now a question that won't tax your memory.
[96:40.49]This question refers to the documentation that came with your copy of the game.
[96:45.53]Okay.
[96:46.25]So we can't play this one.
[96:49.30]The gal sitting around the campfire is playing a what?
[96:53.46]This is your one chance.
[96:54.28]I ain't... I'm not looking it up.
[97:01.40]No.
[97:05.70]I refuse to look this up.
[97:08.67]Is it B?
[97:08.97]B, here's your chance.
[97:13.59]Smart map?
[97:15.05]Uh, hold on, I can't really get it.
[97:16.17]Uh, here you go.
[97:20.09]Smart map.
[97:23.17]This is your shot.
[97:36.68]I can't reset it, because I have to... I'm stuck in this window.
[97:42.88]It looks like it's Harmonica.
[97:49.31]I'm clicking Harmonica.
[97:52.53]You guys, this is why you can't have nice things.
[97:58.68]It's actually B. I looked it up.
[98:00.50]Did you look it up?
[98:01.10]Is this real?
[98:07.32]Thank you, and now slip into your leisure suit and prepare to enter the land of lounge lizards with Leisure Suit Larry.
[98:15.04]Okay.
[98:18.89]I got it ready.
[98:20.79]Alright, there I am.
[98:25.57]I wanna exit this game just because of how slow you move.
[98:28.54]Why is he like an octopus?
[98:31.15]He's like a squid.
[98:35.35]I guess we're gonna go in here.
[98:36.75]This is a bar?
[98:45.44]Nice tuck and roll.
[98:46.56]What?
[98:48.76]So that right click is change.
[98:54.60]Right click changes what you... That's porn music.
[98:58.51]This is porn?
[98:59.83]Okay, we're good.
[99:09.96]Why is Dr. Don back here?
[99:12.38]That's Dr. Dan!
[99:18.10]He has nothing to say, but says it continuously.
[99:21.65]You coyly turn your back and relieve yourself.
[99:23.67]You quickly feel much better.
[99:24.79]The hint of smile... What?
[99:27.83]Did I just piss on the ground?
[99:33.31]This place has no ta- I can like, taste things?
[99:37.43]To you, Lefty has no distinctive smell or taste.
[99:49.64]You greet the bartender with a friendly... Hello!
[99:53.40]What'll it be?
[99:53.98]A round.
[99:56.04]A round for everybody.
[99:58.02]Are you sure?
[99:58.56]It'll cost you $90.
[99:59.68]Do I not have that money?
[100:08.69]Blah blah blah blah.
[100:10.33]Yakety yakety yakety yakety blah blah.
[100:12.57]Because Thursday is your night in the barrel.
[100:19.42]Har har.
[100:20.40]Come on.
[100:27.44]Why am I moving so slow?
[100:35.30]Talk to someone in particular.
[100:36.50]Can I leave?
[100:45.46]Can I speed up this emulator?
[100:47.06]I don't think... I mean, this is just, like, on a website.
[100:48.98]It's like a browser.
[100:50.42]I'm not sure I can do it from here.
[100:56.18]Is there a rat on the guy's head?
[100:59.90]You take pity on the poor drunk and want to help him, but his odor convinces you otherwise.
[101:06.62]Oh, fuck.
[101:07.02]There we go.
[101:19.10]Oh, Jesus.
[101:19.64]That's so much better.
[101:20.40]Alright.
[101:31.25]Wait, we're going up?
[101:32.15]Down?
[101:32.41]Where do we go?
[101:32.81]Into the bar?
[101:33.45]Into the toilet.
[102:24.61]Okay.
[102:29.55]Did it crash?
[102:30.01]I crashed.
[102:30.53]It was like fucked up.
[102:31.41]Something happened.
[102:33.59]I saw Leisure Suit Larry's dick and then like he started shitting.
[102:36.87]So no, we're not going to do that one.
[102:38.19]I'm sorry.
[102:38.61]I'm not doing that one.
[102:39.87]That's not going to happen.
[102:44.89]Nope.
[102:46.45]Sorry.
[102:58.44]We'll get them next time.
[102:59.42]No, vetoing all of them now.
[103:00.84]I'm going to use my actual real veto power.
[103:09.17]Nope.
[103:11.89]Call me a tyrant.
[103:13.17]I'm using my true veto powers.
[103:17.40]So, that brings us to here.
[103:19.90]Now we've done three.
[103:21.86]Let's go down to here.
[103:26.16]Make sure we get the ones with the text only.
[103:29.90]Text only.
[103:30.64]Remember, that's very important.
[103:35.06]And here we go.
[103:40.53]Please click what you'd like to see.
[103:52.27]Wow, this is all over the place.
[104:01.36]This is very, very, very spread out.
[104:04.42]But there is a clear winner.
[104:09.17]Very much so.
[104:17.87]With 35% or 37% of the vote at this point.
[104:25.99]Everyone seems to be changing their mind.
[104:30.53]Thank you for voting.
[104:32.49]That's all we need to see.
[104:34.23]Two spread out.
[104:39.77]Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?
[104:44.09]Thank you for voting.
[104:50.93]1993.
[104:54.03]C is Mount... Whatever that said.
[104:58.70]I think this is the Zoombinis people, by the way.
[105:18.21]I already like this one.
[105:27.78]Where are we?
[105:28.34]Where in the USA are we?
[105:31.06]That's a huge antenna.
[105:36.42]That would be poking you in the mouth and nose and shit.
[105:38.58]That would go up your nose and kill you.
[105:43.48]You would sneeze, and that antenna would go into your nose, through your nostril, into your brain, and you'd die.
[105:55.59]What are we doing?
[106:00.84]Eject, eject.
[106:08.57]Where is she?
[106:10.60]Where did she go?
[106:11.56]She went somewhere in the United States.
[106:13.38]Is this me?
[106:26.23]What?
[106:26.93]Vile, vile.
[106:30.25]Vile, what?
[106:31.09]Is this Carmen Sandiego's group of people?
[106:38.82]You're taking a very long time to do this.
[106:41.14]Why couldn't you just pick them up?
[106:42.86]They're at the airport.
[106:47.00]Okay.
[106:51.24]Acme.
[106:53.00]Okay, gumshoes!

[107:15.51]Can I delete that?
[107:20.05]Where's backspace?
[107:20.79]Is there no backspace?
[107:27.36]Use the keyboard?
[107:29.54]Oh, fuck.
[107:30.34]No, it's cancel.
[107:32.78]Okay.

[108:15.55]All the lights on Broadway have been stolen.
[108:18.69]Let me turn this up for you guys.
[108:22.85]Every light.
[108:25.06]Okay.
[108:27.60]So let's call the Acme Travel Services.
[108:29.92]We're going to get to New York.
[108:35.24]To start your investigation, call Acme Travel Service.
[108:38.96]I was going to click it.
[108:39.60]Where are we going?
[108:48.65]Employee Travel.
[108:49.23]New York.
[108:55.21]We only have one option anyways.
[108:58.23]I can't.
[108:58.57]It's going to just do it.
[109:05.63]Manhattan Island.
[109:07.07]The heart of New York City is connected to the mainland by a number of bridges.
[109:11.37]Perhaps the most famous of these is the graceful, arching Brooklyn Bridge, which links Manhattan to the borough of Brooklyn.
[109:17.82]Speak to student.
[109:20.34]He cried yee-haw as he took off for Omaha.
[109:23.28]Who did?
[109:24.98]Check campus.
[109:30.97]Hmm... Oregon Trail.
[109:31.35]Oregon.
[109:31.55]Alright, Telephone Crime Net.
[109:56.60]What?
[109:56.70]Okay.
[109:56.82]Uh... So we gotta go north of Kansas.
[109:57.88]Um... We don't have... I mean, we could go here.
[110:28.10]Should we go to Lincoln?
[110:30.50]Go to Florida!
[110:34.14]Lincoln, Nebraska.
[110:34.72]Let's go.
[110:40.06]She's going to be in the car and drive off.
[110:43.09]Sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping.
[110:46.67]Nebraska has top-notch hunting, fishing, and camping to attract those who love the great outdoors.
[110:51.55]For those who prefer to take their outdoor recreation sitting down, they're
[110:59.00]That person died.
[111:00.98]There's a multitude of rodeos to visit.
[111:02.54]What is that supposed to be?
[111:10.26]When I think of Nebraska, I don't think of circus performers.
[111:18.97]Okay, so let's speak to the violinist.
[111:22.27]He said he had a capital idea to infiltrate the capitol building of the spud state.
[111:27.93]He asked me if I knew a good mambo teacher.
[111:30.53]That would be Idaho.
[111:33.72]Check the pit.
[111:34.32]Uh, this is the dictaphone.
[111:38.84]Description heard on tape.
[111:40.12]It all boils down to this, small fry.
[111:41.96]When searching for the spud state, look under capital I. Dusted.
[111:48.26]Alright.
[111:50.20]Idaho.
[111:53.36]Keep your eyes peeled for the criminal in the spud state.
[111:57.03]You got it.
[112:01.83]Boise!
[112:08.21]What the fuck is this game?
[112:09.33]It's called Freelance Police.
[112:11.29]Open up.
[112:14.95]Although much of Idaho's mountains terrain is not well suited for agriculture.
[112:26.82]There's ice skating in Idaho?
[112:34.36]Wait, what's going on?
[112:38.32]Okay, um, some parts of the state can successfully support ranches and farms.
[112:42.49]Cattle ranching and dairy farming are both important here, but Idaho's most famous product is the potato.
[112:47.49]Let's talk to the jogger.
[112:51.59]He indicated he'd be transplanting himself to Baltimore for a caper at Johns Hopkins Medical School.
[112:57.56]Beware of anyone who challenges you to a game of go fish.
[113:01.92]It's fucking Mario.
[113:02.80]Super Mario.
[113:04.16]Call it an... Okay, so, but just... Maryland?
[113:11.08]Do we just have to fly back and forth?
[113:17.07]U.S.
[113:17.21]Naval Academy on Chesapeake Bay.
[113:19.13]Yeah, okay.
[113:23.31]So we'll just have to go to Maryland now.
[113:32.81]What day is it?
[113:33.39]Do we have any evidence?
[113:38.48]Enter evidence and press transmit.
[113:41.36]Oh no, oh no no no, wait wait, I didn't want to do this.
[113:47.60]Cancel.
[113:49.00]This game is nonsense.
[113:50.02]A cokehead made this game.
[113:52.62]What?
[113:53.36]What are you talking about?
[113:59.67]Alright, let's go to Maryland.
[114:04.81]Why would you?
[114:06.01]What does that even mean?
[114:09.98]Okay.
[114:12.88]Question jogger again.
[114:14.02]Uh oh.
[114:21.08]Cold teeth.
[114:21.68]Is that him?
[114:34.53]That's the worst one yet.
[114:37.68]That's not how you hide to... Ivan, okay.
[114:41.72]He was determined to lose himself in the largest state in the nation.
[114:44.58]He collected recipes from Paris.
[114:48.64]Okay, um, well I know, mail, hair, hobby, card games, gardening, painting, card games, go fish.
[115:03.80]Did we get my... We should have been doing this.
[115:06.09]Alright, let's enter that into evidence.
[115:09.41]Transmit that.
[115:16.85]Warrant Division.
[115:17.53]Wanda here.
[115:18.62]Oh, no, no, no.
[115:20.16]I don't want to... I don't want to warrant.
[115:21.62]Stand by.
[115:23.90]I know that he's male and likes card games.
[115:26.72]I've sent you a list of possible suspects.
[115:32.29]Uh, every Magic the Gathering convention.
[115:38.60]That's it?
[115:43.54]Hallelujah and Ray Zarumpas are the only two people in the country that are male and like card games.
[115:52.85]Okay.
[115:57.73]Visit the fair city of Fairbanks.
[116:00.63]Alright, biggest state in the, uh, what is it?
[116:04.10]Fucking Alaska?
[116:05.52]Texas?
[116:05.96]Which one is it?
[116:07.88]California?
[116:08.30]Are we talking like volume?
[116:12.89]It's Texas.
[116:17.09]Yeah, let's go.
[116:23.27]What do you mean?
[116:24.55]It is Alaska.
[116:25.53]I had it right.
[116:26.09]Okay.
[116:40.96]What do you mean I didn't know that?
[116:43.96]Are you dumping trash here?
[116:49.20]Why are you dumping trash in Alaska?
[116:53.42]That's not even like, hey, I'm a bad guy spying on you.
[116:56.21]We're just dumping in Alaska.
[117:02.21]What?
[117:02.55]Okay, so let's talk to the actress.
[117:09.17]There are a lot of shady characters lurking around here.
[117:11.05]I'd be careful if I were you.
[117:12.64]By the way, do you have a warrant?
[117:14.86]That's Carmen Sandiego right there.
[117:20.14]Arrest.
[117:21.28]How do you arrest a person?
[117:39.16]File written in large, black letters in the front.
[117:41.57]Okay.
[117:47.13]I just let Carmen San Diego go.
[117:52.74]It's taking a while.
[117:53.46]There they go!
[117:57.28]We're going in the Ghostbusters car!
[118:23.56]Did we get him?
[118:24.12]Did we get... Urgent report.
[118:30.14]Ray Zarumpas has just been tracked to Alaska by Gumshoe Jerma.
[118:36.45]However, the suspect could not be held because the arresting officer did not have a warrant.
[118:43.57]No!
[118:44.75]You're gonna have to try harder.
[118:50.29]Okay, are you ready for another case?
[119:02.03]I don't really want to fly from city to city.
[119:06.13]That was fun.
[119:06.61]That was cute.
[119:07.31]It was fun.
[119:08.01]It was like a game for kids.
[119:14.36]That's gonna be it for that one.
[119:19.94]It was like a game, you know?
[119:21.42]It was like a game for kids.
[119:25.53]Alright, so we got a couple more to do here.
[119:27.29]Let's get the list back on.
[119:35.53]It was right here, if I'm not mistaken, right?
[119:39.65]Right here?
[119:41.77]This looks correct.
[119:43.09]Is it correct or was it down more?
[119:44.81]Like right here.
[119:48.81]Yeah, it was right there.
[119:52.41]Okay, so remember the text on the screen
[119:58.68]Do not click ones that do not have text.
[120:00.26]Like, don't click down here.
[120:01.29]It's not going to be valid.
[120:03.85]Only the places with text.
[120:06.93]Here we go.
[120:07.93]Please click on the screen where you'd like us to go next.
[120:11.41]It's up to you, not up to me.
[120:21.06]Hmm.
[120:22.74]Interesting.
[120:23.72]Interesting selections.
[120:42.37]How many times can you click?
[120:43.33]Once.
[120:45.71]One click per person.
[120:50.53]That's as many.
[120:51.29]It's not going to count if you do it again.
[120:53.05]It's only going to count the first time.
[120:57.61]So we got 32%.
[120:58.13]We're going to burger time.
[121:04.92]Thank you for voting.
[121:07.10]We will come back here and we will do the last one on this list.
[121:11.42]So, yeah, I'm not going to click.
[121:12.84]I'm going to actually open a new window.
[121:17.38]Burger time!
[121:21.68]This is by 1982.
[121:23.28]This is really old.
[121:27.10]Failed to download the metadata.
[121:28.82]Oh, now, why is that?

[126:58.01]No!
[126:58.99]Fuck!
[127:03.78]I got two more lives.
[127:04.62]I'm losing them here.
[127:24.89]Oh, I lost it.
[127:26.38]I can still do it.
[128:02.43]No!
[128:03.39]Ah!

[128:34.10]Fuck!
[128:34.40]I had it too.
[128:36.15]I was doing so well.

[128:41.15]This is the last one.
[129:03.42]Straight up.
[129:03.92]No, come up here.
[129:04.66]Straight up.
[129:21.35]No unnecessary deaths here.
[129:24.29]And then smush him.
[129:28.45]Smush.
[129:30.13]I can't believe I didn't get it.
[129:31.55]I'm fucking done.
[129:32.39]I'm exiting.
[129:34.05]I just... I got too greedy.
[129:39.69]I really did.
[129:40.15]I didn't get that.
[129:41.95]I'm losing it.
[129:45.95]That was greedy too, but it was worth it.
[129:57.44]Too bad I don't have anything to do anything right here, but I can get something right now.
[130:00.73]If I get up there quick enough, I can get at least one of them.
[130:24.39]Stupid.
[130:25.49]Stupid little lettuces, whatever you are.
[130:28.11]Give me the points.
[130:37.02]Alright, last one.
[130:45.82]And then I'm gonna go for the clothes here.
[130:47.48]Oh, fuck.
[130:52.85]I gotta go up.
[130:55.02]Oh, no.
[130:55.42]Pepper.
[130:57.32]That's close.
[131:02.38]They're pickles, you dill.
[131:06.05]What are the other things?
[131:07.57]Onions?
[131:15.56]Ah, too gritty.
[131:16.24]Don't do it.
[131:23.35]I got so greedy.
[131:24.86]I'm too into much pepper.
[131:26.04]I need this pepper.
[131:42.89]I'm going too fast.
[131:43.95]God, dude.
[131:46.11]I'm gonna watch somebody do a full speedrun of this game tomorrow.
[131:50.49]Why tomorrow?
[131:51.41]I don't know.
[131:57.99]Alright, this one, I'm gonna get it perfect.

[132:39.44]What the fuck was that shit?
[132:40.58]He walked to the right.
[132:41.28]What was that little juke to the right?
[133:13.39]I can't fucking believe you went that way.
[133:57.20]Goddammit, that game's a lot of fun, but it's really hard.

[143:20.02]I can't do it again.
[143:26.22]Yeah, okay.
[143:28.86]This is really cool, though.
[143:30.44]But, yeah, I don't want to make everybody puke.

[150:24.68]You get to the restaurant and find your table.
[150:26.32]After taking your order, the waiter returns and accidentally spills soup all over your date's blouse.
[150:32.45]Jen says, ow, that hurts.

[150:57.83]You go out to dinner to a fancy restaurant.
[151:00.17]When you get inside, you see a really hot lady in a low-cut dress.
[151:03.89]You stare intently at her cleavage.
[151:05.95]Jen gives you a dirty look.
[151:13.68]She's not my type.

[152:48.39]I went to 180.
[152:51.45]This person's like a stick bug.
[152:57.09]Skeleton weighs more than that.
[152:59.78]I fucked it up.
[153:11.88]Okay, date list.
[153:15.13]Jesus.
[153:19.30]Go horseback riding.
[153:20.56]That sounds like fun.
[153:24.16]Jean, do you want to go horseback riding?
[153:26.08]I don't think so.
[153:31.24]Go skiing.
[153:34.55]Jean, do you want to go skiing in the Alps?
[153:37.26]Okay.
[153:38.86]You and your girlfriend arrive in Switzerland and you hit the slopes.
[153:41.64]After a very active day of skiing, you retire to the lodge and snuggle up to a warm fire.
[153:46.26]Just the two of you, sitting by the fire.
[153:49.00]Jean says, isn't this romantic?
[153:53.81]It really is.
[153:54.39]I suppose so.
[153:55.05]I guess so.
[153:56.09]Let's just shut up.
[153:57.25]Let's go drink some dark beer.
[154:00.27]Um...
[154:04.41]I suppose.
[154:05.73]You two are sitting together enjoying a moment of great intimacy.
[154:07.61]She looks long in the eye with glazed eyes.
[154:09.19]Then suddenly Jean sighs.
[154:10.21]Let's get married right now!
[154:19.71]You kidding?
[154:20.27]I don't think that would be such a good idea at this time.
[154:22.05]I think we need... You two decide to get married and have your honeymoon right there.
[154:27.49]Jean looks stunning in her beautiful wedding dress.
[154:29.73]She brought the wedding dress with her.
[154:36.28]Oh, shit.
[155:25.75]Go to... How about go... She's an ant.
[155:30.83]Go to the big party.

[155:36.15]No way, I'm not that dumb.
[155:39.05]Do you want to go to the zoo?
[155:40.09]She's going to get licked up by a giraffe.
[155:43.21]No way, I'm not that dumb to go to the zoo.
[155:46.07]You're not stupid enough to go to the zoo.
[155:47.83]What about the opera?
[155:50.81]Do you want to go to the opera?
[155:51.81]I'm not that dumb.
[155:57.21]Do you want to go fly to Vegas for the weekend?

[156:07.59]Go to Hawaii for lunch.
[156:09.63]No way, I'm not that dumb.
[156:11.33]These are all extravagant, incredibly expensive, insanely awesome dates.
[156:16.94]Do you want to come over?
[156:19.36]No way, I'm not that dumb.
[156:22.60]Aren't we dating?
[156:23.62]What are you talking about?
[156:30.85]Go to a... Go to male strip joint.
[156:34.41]No way, I'm not that dumb.
[156:40.02]No, I'm not that stupid.
[156:46.22]Go to dinner.
[156:48.80]No.
[156:49.99]Apparently that's not stupid, it's just no.
[156:53.33]You want to go shopping?
[156:54.63]Forget it.
[156:54.99]You want to go to the bar?
[156:57.55]No, I'm not stupid.
[156:59.09]Would you like to go to a rock concert?
[157:01.69]Some other time, maybe.
[157:03.07]Would you like to go to a Broadway show?
[157:04.91]No, I'm smart.
[157:06.43]Would you like to go to a party at a friend's place?

[157:17.92]Let's play strip Monopoly.
[157:18.96]You want to do that?
[157:19.76]No, Monopoly's dumb.
[157:20.92]It's for dumb people.
[157:21.80]You want to go to a hockey game?
[157:22.71]Hockey's not even...
[157:29.67]She likes hockey.
[157:31.99]You arrive at the hockey game with your date.
[157:33.61]Early in the game, one of the players gets thrown into the boards right near your seat.
[157:37.49]Jessica is startled and puts an arm around you impulsively.
[157:42.37]Oh my fucking god.
[157:46.23]Oh my god.
[157:50.42]Relax, it's fine.
[157:52.90]The game starts to get really exciting.
[157:54.62]Someone almost scores a goal.
[157:56.16]Suddenly two players start fighting.
[157:57.88]Then four players are going at it.
[157:59.04]Then the entire teams are fighting.
[158:00.48]The bench is empty.
[158:02.16]All the players are out on the ice fighting.
[158:04.12]Then the crowd starts fighting.
[158:06.16]A couple of bald guys with beer bellies start punching away nearby.
[158:10.84]One of them is thrown sprawling into you too.
[158:13.22]Jessica starts punching with wild abandon.
[158:22.24]Why?
[158:23.60]Why would I do that?
[158:25.88]What?
[158:26.58]Aren't we on the same team?
[158:28.82]We're on the same team.
[158:37.07]There's no reason for that.
[158:40.33]Just like, oh yeah, here comes a big fight.
[158:42.81]Get him.
[158:43.30]Two bald guys are fighting us.
[158:45.36]Hey, honey.
[158:47.38]Wrong person.
[158:49.25]What the fuck are you talking about?
[158:51.19]We're on the same team.
[158:52.27]She's punching.
[158:53.67]No!
[158:56.30]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[159:02.66]We're on the same damn team.
[159:08.80]That was certainly a messy scene.
[159:10.18]The hockey game is finally over.
[159:11.58]Neither of you has any idea who won.
[159:13.20]Does it really matter?
[159:14.56]You both get back to your car while avoiding the hyper drunk fans.
[159:18.10]Jessica remarks, hockey is really stupid.
[159:20.92]You're a moron.
[159:31.29]Wasn't she just...
[159:33.68]She started fighting before I did.
[159:36.16]She was throwing punches before I even... She was beating people up?
[159:43.57]Hey.
[159:47.19]Wanna come over to my place?
[159:49.85]She thinks over your offer for a moment, then Jessica says, no way.
[159:52.45]I'm not that kind of girl.
[159:56.03]Here, have a flower.
[159:59.18]You pull up in her driveway and shut off the engine.
[160:01.16]She gets out of the car and you follow her and walk to the door.
[160:03.30]She frowns and says, get lost.
[160:05.42]Okay.
[160:09.86]So long.
[160:11.75]So long.
[160:12.25]See you later.
[160:13.39]Whatever.
[160:13.81]I can't win with you.
[160:18.17]I dump her before she dumps me.
[160:19.55]Quick.
[160:20.53]Yes.
[160:20.73]Yes.
[160:30.64]Every idea is stupid.
[160:32.20]I don't want to go to dinner.
[160:33.10]Finally, I want to go to a hockey game.
[160:35.84]She says yes.
[160:38.65]The crowd starts fighting.
[160:39.73]She starts punching people in the face.
[160:41.85]She starts beating people up.
[160:43.79]I join the fray, and I'm like, we're on the same team.
[160:46.49]Hey, that was crazy.
[160:47.25]You're stupid.
[160:47.75]You're a moron.
[160:48.98]Okay, I'll drop you off.
[160:49.96]Loser, get out of here.
[160:51.48]What?
[160:51.62]What?
[161:03.89]I think we're going to close it on that one.
[161:07.69]I feel like we saw the best possible ridiculous scenario.
[161:13.07]One more?
[161:13.43]Alright, we'll do one more.
[161:15.03]One more.
[161:51.99]um eight okay overflow redo I broke the game she's like how tall is that
[162:30.28]Jip.
[162:30.88]I broke it.
[162:31.50]Jip.
[162:31.88]Press any key.
[162:32.76]DL rating is 2.
[162:33.90]Okay, let's see.
[162:40.66]What do you want to do?
[162:43.05]How about let's go fishing?
[162:46.77]Oh, no.
[162:47.37]She's going to be... Fly to Vegas for the weekend.
[162:52.09]No, it's not going to be hockey again.
[162:53.67]Let's go scuba diving.
[162:56.71]I'd love to.
[162:57.20]Here we go.
[162:57.54]Good.
[162:59.46]You and your girlfriend arrive in Cozumel, Mexico and hop on a boat for some exhilarating scuba diving.
[163:05.74]After carefully checking the equipment and reviewing the fundamental rules of diving, you dive off into the deep and do some exploration and practice some buddy breathing.
[163:15.24]After a very active day of diving, she's such an active woman, isn't she?
[163:19.68]During which you both get quite wet.
[163:21.83]You retire to the villa and have a little siesta, just the two of you.
[163:25.27]Jack Set says, isn't this romantic?
[163:32.35]Jack said is also, I think, two to three hundred feet tall.
[163:41.15]Let's go have some, like, beer.
[163:43.91]You two are sitting together enjoying a moment of great intimacy.
[163:46.21]She looks longingly at you with glazed eyes and suddenly Jack said blurts, let's get married.
[163:57.83]You two decide to get married and have your honeymoon right there.
[164:00.01]She looks ridiculous in her rented wedding dress.
[164:05.38]The happy couple lives happily ever after in the suburbs for a while.
[164:08.56]Eventually you both realize that marriage was a mistake.
[164:10.22]You have more and more bitter fights.
[164:11.82]Finally she divorces you.
[164:13.95]Oh well.
[164:28.52]Let's go up four.
[164:36.72]That's fine.
[164:42.33]Why?
[164:51.75]What are you talking about?
[165:02.00]I can't distribute?
[165:02.72]Uh, I don't know.
[165:15.30]30?
[165:15.32]25?
[165:15.34]26?
[165:15.36]Uh, 20... 20?
[165:15.68]23?
[165:18.07]Uh, 25?
[165:18.69]I don't know.
[165:19.85]I don't... There's no such thing as a perfect person, okay?
[165:25.17]I can't... I don't have any points left.
[165:35.92]Okay, let's go to... Let's go bowling.
[165:38.42]That's easy.
[165:40.06]Are you kidding?
[165:40.54]No way.
[165:47.66]Go to a baseball game.
[165:49.36]Sure, okay, baseball.
[165:50.78]There's no fights in baseballs.
[165:54.73]You arrive at the stadium with your girlfriend and sit down in your nice, comfortable box seats on the third base side.
[166:02.77]Perfect.
[166:03.45]Goes off and buys t-shirts and caps and spends 50 bucks.
[166:08.37]Concentrate on the game.
[166:09.25]Concentrate on the blonde a few seats away.
[166:13.56]Concentrate on your girlfriend.
[166:14.66]Read the program.
[166:15.34]Don't concentrate.
[166:15.98]It's too hot for that.
[166:19.32]Let's concentrate on the girlfriend.
[166:23.22]You and your girlfriend are sitting drowsily in the hot sun.
[166:26.32]The game is dragging on.
[166:28.16]A slow reliever is on the mound.
[166:29.80]It takes about 10 minutes to make each pitch.
[166:32.23]He winds up.
[166:33.69]10 minutes later, he pitches.
[166:35.35]It's a well-hit ball.
[166:36.43]Foul up the third baseline.
[166:37.67]The ball is coming right at you.
[166:38.83]And before you can quite realize what's happening, you've caught it.
[166:42.39]Ouch.
[166:42.65]What do you mean, ouch?
[166:48.30]Baseball.
[166:48.66]I like baseball.
[166:49.32]What's wrong with baseball?
[166:50.78]Alright, so I caught the ball.
[166:52.66]Give the ball to your girlfriend.
[166:53.74]How sweet.
[166:54.40]Hurl the ball at her head.
[166:58.56]Keep the ball.
[166:59.44]Hurl the ball at the old lady.
[167:01.75]Three rows away.
[167:03.07]Throw the ball at the blonde.
[167:07.71]Hurl the ball at the third baby.
[167:09.27]Why is this just weirdo fucking psycho simulator?
[167:21.96]Nothing happened.
[167:26.91]We went home.
[167:38.07]I have no idea.
[167:42.45]How about come over and go... Oh, did we drop some frames?
[167:44.62]Yeah, we did.
[167:46.40]Come over and go in the swimming pool.
[167:52.02]I'm sorry, I can't go out with you anymore.
[167:53.46]You've been dumped.
[168:00.08]I don't know.
[168:00.40]Swimette.
[168:02.30]It's in your name.
[168:02.82]You have to like swimming.
[168:05.61]Six?
[168:06.19]Where's six?
[168:07.95]Sure.
[168:09.75]Face negative 14.
[168:14.35]What?
[168:19.67]Come over and go swimming in the pool.
[168:22.55]No way.
[168:25.50]I want to go swimming.
[168:26.74]No way.
[168:31.60]Hot tub.
[168:33.62]This is going to be another one of these.
[168:34.48]I have to restart the game to get somebody to... Okay, I'll restart it.
[168:38.44]Let me just physically go like this.
[168:44.83]You lose status points when you get dumped.
[168:46.97]I see.
[168:47.29]I think I broke it.
[168:51.79]I may have broke the game.
[169:00.56]Alright, here we go.
[169:06.31]New game.
[169:07.73]My first name.
[169:11.77]Okay.
[169:15.53]No, not like Swimette again.
[169:16.53]How about just like... I don't know.
[169:19.98]Um... Uh... Tiffany?
[169:34.17]How about Tiffany?
[169:36.81]OK, Tiffany.
[169:40.99]Tiffany.
[169:41.31]OK, let's get it.
[169:41.96]62, I don't know, 130, and measurement in inches.
[169:46.56]I don't know these.
[169:55.41]Overall ratings of three.
[169:59.85]Okay, you dress, alright.
[170:01.59]Trustworthy.
[170:02.73]Very trustworthy.
[170:03.57]Tiffany doesn't really, no, doesn't get jealous that often.
[170:07.41]Personality.
[170:08.09]Friendly.
[170:09.09]Very friendly.
[170:10.83]Happy.
[170:12.15]How old do you get along with Tiffany's friends?
[170:13.61]Good.
[170:13.77]Along well.
[170:14.89]Alright.
[170:15.99]Let's go.
[170:17.16]I want to go swimming.
[170:22.76]I don't want to go swimming.
[170:25.40]I want to go in the hot tub.
[170:33.69]Uh, let's... Strip Monopoly.
[170:40.95]Local beach.
[170:43.69]Forget it, why?
[170:50.73]Horseback riding.
[170:52.65]Sounds like fun, here we go, finally.
[170:55.41]You go horseback riding with your girlfriend.
[170:58.41]You follow the trails at the Old West Riding Stables.
[171:01.91]You bounce up and down on your horse and your balls start to get sore.
[171:09.02]Your girlfriend seems to be used to it, though.
[171:11.48]She knows her horse well.
[171:12.62]Very, very well, in fact.
[171:14.45]What?
[171:14.83]After riding for a couple hours, Tiffany says, this is so exhilarating, isn't it?
[171:18.71]Sure, whatever you say.
[171:19.81]You're right.
[171:20.31]That's what I think.
[171:22.65]Grab your girl.
[171:25.11]Aren't we on the horse?
[171:28.36]Yeah, you're right.
[171:29.04]That's what I think.
[171:34.36]That's it?
[171:36.40]Let's go horseback riding again.
[171:38.67]Okay, grab your horse.
[171:48.79]Is there any other options?
[171:52.65]I think that's it.
[171:55.79]Let's fly to China for dinner.
[171:58.95]Why would you fly to China?
[172:02.61]To go to dinner.
[172:03.51]What kind of like billionaire are you?
[172:07.17]What better place to enjoy fine Chinese cuisine than China itself?
[172:11.87]You fly to the capital city of China and eat at one of the finest outdoor restaurants in Tiananmen Square.
[172:17.92]You decide to order Chinese food.
[172:21.50]Okay.
[172:22.00]The food arrives and you both dig in.
[172:23.66]Tiffany says, I just love Chinese food.
[172:25.44]I don't get it.

[175:10.05]No mods?
[175:12.01]Oh shit!
[175:18.97]Well, that was, um... I'm a little shocked at the thing that we just witnessed.
[175:30.48]It was fucking kind of ridiculous.
[175:31.82]It was very ridiculous, actually.
[175:34.62]We're moving on from that one.
[175:36.02]I ain't gonna play that one anymore.
[175:42.79]So, let's go.
[175:44.83]Here's the list again, as you see.
[175:54.13]I think we have one more or two, what, two more here?
[176:04.18]So, okay.
[176:11.18]Wait, this is not right.
[176:16.25]Bingo Sunshine, thanks for the five community subs.
[176:18.65]Appreciate it.
[176:21.03]Thank you for that.
[176:27.71]Five community subs coming in.
[176:29.72]Thank you.
[176:30.78]That was Girlfriend Construction Simulator or whatever the hell that was called.
[176:35.84]Girlfriend Construction Set.
[176:40.48]We have, I believe, one more here to do.
[176:46.81]Please vote when you get a chance.
[176:56.44]We just did... I'm not going back and playing that again.
[176:59.42]No.
[177:01.68]I'm not going back and playing it.
[177:02.98]I'm not doing it.
[177:08.08]Not happening.
[177:13.75]I have to pee, too.
[177:20.33]Two more.
[177:20.79]Two more, yeah.
[177:22.35]Alright, whatever it is, I will... It looks like it's going to be Roadrunner.
[177:28.91]So when I come back from taking a piss, we will open up Roadrunner and we'll play it.
[177:35.34]Be right back.
[177:41.71]I ain't going to let you get that.
[177:43.87]I'm not going to leave with the clicks on screen.
[177:46.43]Be right back.
[180:22.09]Alright.
[180:23.57]Here we go.
[180:32.46]Roadrunner.
[180:37.70]Let's get it done here.
[180:41.34]1989.
[180:41.36]This is probably going to be a side-scrolling video game.
[180:53.09]If I were to take a random guess, that's what it would be.
[181:07.21]Best Road Runners.
[181:10.06]Roll?
[181:12.12]Play one using the keyboard.
[181:13.14]Okay, so KP789, what is this?

[181:20.88]So this is, it's the number pad.
[181:26.18]Uh, $50 just came in from Ampharic.
[181:32.37]Thank you so much, Ampharic.
[181:34.07]For the huge amount of money.
[181:35.51]And you had community subs earlier, too.
[181:36.97]Thank you.
[181:39.15]Uh, yeah, we can... What's that?
[181:41.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[181:41.74]What's going on?
[181:43.68]Oh, okay.
[181:45.54]Uh, you can take it off sub only.
[181:46.58]I think we're good.
[181:50.96]But thank you for the 50 bucks, Ampharic.
[181:52.60]Just want to say thanks for the streams and all the content over the years.
[181:54.99]I'm pretty sure I've always almost died from laughter too much during some of these streams, but totally worth it.
[182:00.79]You deserve all the support you get, so keep doing you.
[182:05.08]Thank you.
[182:06.16]I'm gonna keep doing it.
[182:07.10]We're gonna keep doing... I'm gonna keep doing it.
[182:11.28]As long as I possibly can.
[182:13.48]I have to press escape to play the game.
[182:16.69]But thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[182:20.42]It's a lot of money.
[182:22.80]Uh, Wile E. Coyote, and there's me.
[182:24.38]That's a pretty, you know, that's a cute emote version of these characters.
[182:34.75]What is jump?
[182:37.47]Let's get the bird seed.
[182:39.59]Roadrunner, you missed a seed!
[182:40.83]Roadrunner, you missed a seed!
[182:42.35]Did you get hit by a car?
[182:47.33]I know I missed a seed, but what am I gonna do?
[182:54.66]I got five.
[182:55.18]That's why I need five, right?
[183:03.88]Well, he... we both got run over, so... Does that really matter?
[183:09.76]Alright, let me just get the end of this.
[183:22.49]PepoDance.
[183:26.50]It's hard to see.
[183:27.28]The cars just come out of nowhere.
[183:28.64]There's not even a foot in front of the screen to see where the cars are coming from.
[183:35.31]Can you jump the cars?
[183:38.81]Maybe it's just spam jump.
[183:43.69]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[183:45.91]Down!
[183:46.19]Go down, down, down, down!
[183:55.73]That's so hard to do.
[184:04.42]Okay.
[184:05.08]Oh god, again.
[184:17.27]Down, down, quick!
[184:18.81]Get up!
[184:20.23]What's wrong with him?
[184:21.05]Was he drunk?
[184:40.16]And I missed 18 bird seeds.
[184:50.99]No, go this way.
[184:51.63]Why is it going over there?
[184:55.25]This is so fucked up.
[185:37.97]I'm laughing for a very specific reason and I can't even say anything.
[185:44.89]The numpad on the controls... I can't even play this.
[185:51.47]This game is fucking stupid.
[186:04.96]Alright.
[186:07.39]Rude?
[186:07.85]I mean, yeah, rude, but you have nine different buttons for up, down, left, and right.
[186:17.98]Nine.
[186:18.28]Alright, here we go.
[186:26.59]Oh, I fucked it up.
[186:27.33]Sorry.
[186:35.75]I opened it in a tab last time.
[186:36.95]Why did I do this?
[186:39.37]Alright, so we have one more to pick from this list.
[186:44.77]Please pick it.
[186:46.61]I wish you luck.
[186:48.19]Hopefully you pick something good.
[186:51.59]Let's see what you get.
[186:56.24]One, two, three.
[186:59.22]Please vote if you could.
[187:06.86]And remember, only click on something if it is on the screen, like text on the screen.
[187:19.23]So, 20% of you just don't want to be counted as a vote.
[187:24.15]That's okay.
[187:28.19]And you guys want me to play Q-Bert?
[187:33.97]You actually want Q-Bert?
[187:45.09]Dude, I had this sick tattoo I was going to get.
[187:47.16]You guys would have thought it was fucking awesome.
[187:50.26]Dude, is it going to be Q-Bert?
[187:52.54]With, like, weed eyes?
[187:55.40]And he was going to have a joint on his hand?
[187:58.14]It's going to be fucking so awesome.
[188:06.63]Alright, let's play Q-Bert.
[188:18.62]New tab.
[188:22.56]Hubert is a very old one.
[188:25.41]For all you guys making fun of the boomer shit, you certainly do pick the boomer games.
[188:30.83]Alright.
[188:34.72]Press space to play.
[188:37.54]I think it's to jump on the...
[188:41.12]Cupid is... If I remember, you just have to turn the... Yeah, not up.
[188:48.88]You have to turn all the other colors, right?
[188:52.88]Yes, you need to change everything to that.
[188:56.35]So, how do I... How do I move?
[189:02.53]Is it...
[189:09.41]Space?
[189:09.81]How can I not jump?
[189:12.71]Number pad?
[189:17.53]Use your mind.
[189:18.25]Let me try it again.
[189:21.41]I'll try down on number pad.
[189:23.25]Oh, okay, there we go.
[189:23.97]Hold on.
[189:25.93]So it is like the... What's weird?
[189:31.61]It's one and three... One, three... What are you doing?
[189:35.93]Can I...
[189:41.27]Alright, I think it's 1379.
[189:42.27]Let's try it again.
[189:47.48]Yeah, it's definitely 1379.
[189:51.94]Let's go.
[189:52.24]On the numpad.
[189:52.84]Yeah, it is.
[190:07.85]Hubert!
[190:10.61]Oops, I was looking at chat.
[190:22.24]I got really bored for a second.
[190:29.53]I don't know what it was, man.
[190:30.55]It was like ultimate hyperboredom for five tenths of a second.
[190:41.97]Here we go.
[190:46.51]I like to do this technique with Q-Bert.
[190:50.93]Go down in the middle here.
[190:52.31]No, I tried to hit seven.
[190:57.18]Just give me a controller, goddammit.
[191:29.88]I'm sorry.
[191:30.34]I can't play this game with two hands.
[191:33.41]I'm not playing Qbert with two hands on the number pad.
[191:37.95]You know what I mean?
[191:38.61]Like, put your hand on your numpad and like, 7913.
[191:41.97]It's like, I'm like playing the guitar.
[191:53.84]I can do that just fine?
[191:56.14]I don't believe that.
[192:02.23]Because you have to go from 7 to 1, it's a long way.
[192:06.69]If you need to go up and then down left, it's like 7, then you have to go all the way down.
[192:14.12]No.
[192:14.76]No, I didn't play that.
[192:25.57]Put one finger on each button.
[192:28.13]Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[192:28.81]I don't want to do... What do you mean one finger up?
[192:30.91]Do I have to have a claw?
[192:33.49]Like index?
[192:35.29]Thumb?
[192:36.97]Do you want to claw the numpad?
[192:47.86]You're not going to claw the numpad.
[192:49.60]It's not going to happen.
[192:50.87]You're going to accidentally press like two buttons at the same time.
[192:53.03]And then you're going to go, what the fuck?
[192:55.47]What the fuck?
[192:58.82]For one of you, you probably just did it.
[193:05.34]I'm just on camera, so you get to see me do it.
[193:13.21]Thinking about getting, like, a tattoo of Qbert.
[193:15.91]With, like, wicked fucking weed eyes.
[193:17.89]And he's got, like, a fucking Guinness in his hand.
[193:19.81]You know what I mean?
[193:24.82]Where are we going?
[193:31.89]Is anybody clicking?
[193:46.23]I'm not gonna do girlfriend construction set again.
[193:58.21]Okay, we got King's Bounty.
[194:03.25]We got Bruce Lee.
[194:05.60]King's Bounty.
[194:08.28]This is the last one.
[194:14.22]Did three already?
[194:15.22]Did we?
[194:17.35]Did we?
[194:17.93]Oh, no.
[194:18.33]We did Girlfriend Construction.
[194:20.09]Oh, fuck!
[194:21.83]Uh-oh.
[194:25.53]Uh-oh.
[194:30.32]Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna have to go here with...
[194:38.05]Yeah, Q-Bert didn't count.
[194:39.03]That's true.
[194:41.98]We're gonna do Bruce Lee.
[194:42.88]Yeah, I didn't play... Q-Bert didn't count.
[194:53.45]My hands hurt too much when I play it.
[194:54.77]It's too much pain for my fingers.
[194:56.57]Alright, let's do Bruce Lee.
[195:06.13]Weed?
[195:06.77]Oh, yeah, think about getting, like, weed.
[195:09.55]TV set on composite.
[195:10.65]I don't know what that just said, but okay.
[195:18.43]This game sounds like it's underwater.
[195:30.80]Play versus computer.
[195:32.62]Or Terminator.
[195:35.77]Let's just try this.
[195:39.22]Is something wrong with the game?
[195:40.26]Is this thing... Is this thing fighting me?
[196:04.62]This one hurts.
[196:06.08]This one hurts more than Q-Bert.
[196:11.65]I think I lost.
[196:15.71]Can I climb?
[196:21.23]This probably looks better on a CRT.
[196:22.77]Oh, absolutely.
[196:31.20]Just like in the movie!
[196:34.33]Alright, I can't look at it.
[196:35.45]I can't look at it anymore.
[196:40.95]Okay, so.
[196:47.31]It is time.
[196:49.47]To scroll.
[196:52.35]Two games that don't count equals one game that counts.
[196:55.67]Alright, so where are we going?
[196:59.41]We're here, we're going down here.
[197:07.22]Which gets us to this.
[197:15.42]Like right here.
[197:16.82]Should be good.
[197:24.29]And that should get us in a good spot.
[197:32.13]Remember, if there's no text on the screen, it's not going to do anything.
[197:51.89]is this so it looks like Ford simulator 5.0 I don't know why you'd have four other versions of this game
[198:20.66]But it seems like that's where you guys want to go.
[198:26.02]We had, uh, some... Synth Life.
[198:32.35]There's some good ones on here.
[198:34.85]There are some good ones on here, you're right.
[198:36.25]Alright, we're going to do Ford Simulator. 5.0.
[198:54.02]Pretty good graphics for a DOS game.
[198:57.48]Here comes a gigantic advertisement.

[200:24.48]Let's get a Mustang.
[200:27.95]What?
[200:28.35]I don't want a... That's what I want?
[200:29.95]I want a Mustang.
[200:34.09]Paint it.
[200:34.73]Okay, let's see what we can do for colors.
[200:36.27]I think my browser crashed.
[200:40.15]Nope.
[200:45.70]Hmm.
[200:46.26]Alright.
[200:46.56]What about like bumblebee?
[200:56.32]Alright.
[200:56.54]It looks good.
[201:00.28]Hey, I just painted it.
[201:12.97]Paint it.
[201:18.33]Is it painted?
[201:19.54]Canarioa!
[201:34.49]Drive.
[201:36.19]Uh, beginner.
[201:38.17]Do you want sound?
[201:38.93]Of course I do.
[201:40.34]Choose a vehicle.
[201:41.12]Mustang.
[201:47.17]You are on the road and ready to go.
[201:48.53]The objective is to get to Lake Wakatanka as fast as possible.
[201:54.39]Accelerate.
[201:56.91]Up, okay, steer, brake, and then shift is space.
[202:09.72]Why can't I just... I'm trying to shift.
[202:16.48]Gas maps food one mile.
[202:23.43]I'm so hit by a truck!
[202:26.35]Shift up!
[202:27.85]Shift into second gear!
[202:39.76]Oh god!
[202:50.22]Fifth gear, I'm 90.
[202:52.76]They're trying to... I clocked you at 32 miles per hour over the limit.
[202:58.71]I hate to do it, but I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
[203:03.09]Sorry, officer.
[203:04.69]I won't do it again.
[203:05.55]Have a nice day.
[203:28.53]Gonna have to write you a ticket.
[203:29.47]Ah, that's too bad.
[203:38.82]I'm only listening to instructions to get there as fast as possible.
[203:42.86]It didn't say follow the rules of the road.
[203:44.38]It didn't say take your time.
[203:45.84]It said get to Wakatanka as fast as possible.
[203:53.43]I'm sorry, I'm listening to instructions.
[204:05.94]Come on, I gotta go like over 100.
[204:10.06]Come on, 98, 99, 100, 102, 105, 110, 110, 100 and fucking 20.
[204:13.42]Oh, fuck.
[204:14.22]Dammit.
[204:26.81]I clocked you at two miles per hour over the limit.
[204:29.81]I'm gonna get a ticket for going like 35 in a 30.
[204:31.84]Like a 30... what?
[204:37.12]You're gonna clock me at like 32 miles per hour in a 30?
[204:39.58]And you're gonna give me a ticket?
[204:44.32]You were going 42 in a 40.
[204:45.63]What?
[204:45.93]You're gonna get a ticket for that?
[205:03.30]Your average speed was 16 miles per hour?
[205:07.48]No, I don't want to do that again.
[205:08.64]Alright, I've had enough.
[205:11.94]Let's go back.
[205:14.00]I don't need to do any more of this.
[205:22.44]Alright, let's go again.
[205:23.22]Where are we going?
[205:36.62]We've got some good ones here.
[205:40.36]Sim Life, Wheel of Fortune, Doom 2.
[205:51.81]Neuromancer, Sim Earth.
[205:58.12]We seem to be split, but Sim Life.
[206:05.21]I think is going to be the victor here.
[206:08.61]Give it another few seconds.
[206:21.46]Five seconds left.
[206:26.73]I think we're good.
[206:29.09]31% of the vote, that's a lot.
[206:30.65]Sim life.
[206:38.37]This is by Maxis, one of the old ones.
[206:46.39]One of the old Maxis games, alright.
[206:49.98]I don't think I've ever played this before. 1992.
[207:01.18]Uh, this is not, that's not a real animal.
[207:03.96]That is a snake with a grasshopper's body and bird feathers.
[207:09.70]And there's a toucan butterfly.
[207:12.34]This could be good.
[207:13.64]I'm looking forward to this now.
[207:15.95]Oh fuck, this looks like a lot.
[207:20.79]Experimental mode.
[207:21.57]Do whatever you want.
[207:22.53]Craft your own plants and animals and let them loose in a world of your own design.
[207:27.53]Or pick various species from the zoo to inhabit your experiment.
[207:31.73]Can you establish a food chain?
[207:32.93]When will disaster strike?
[207:34.05]You play a scenario.
[207:34.83]Alright, let's, I wonder how hard this is.
[207:42.28]Uh-huh, if you're new to Sim Lite, why not try out the tutorial?
[207:44.50]There's no particular scenario to solve.
[207:46.78]You gotta do the basic features of the game.
[207:50.82]Okay, let's just, you know, let's just check it out.
[207:56.44]Sim Ant.
[207:58.56]Dream a lot about Minecraft VR.
[208:00.16]Five community subs.
[208:01.26]Lots of community subs tonight.
[208:03.99]Thank you, guys.
[208:06.61]And thank you to dream a lot about Minecraft VR for the five drop.
[208:10.94]Thank you.
[208:13.28]Welcome to SimLife Tutorial.
[208:14.42]To quit the tutorials, select new game from the meta menu.
[208:18.73]Use tutorial menu to repeat a message at any time.
[208:21.17]To go to the next message instead of waiting for it.
[208:24.09]Okay.
[208:24.71]So, just, let's go.
[208:26.97]Is that my animal?
[208:28.65]Another five community subs just came in from Night Team.
[208:32.15]Fourteen.
[208:33.95]Five more subs.
[208:35.77]Thank you.
[208:38.39]Five more community subs.
[208:40.87]Fuck yeah.
[208:41.33]Thank you.
[208:43.94]Sometimes I always ask you to click a button, and I'm usually, okay, yeah, sure.
[208:47.88]Alright, so, day, night, it's a day-night cycle.
[208:52.17]Yeah, okay, can you tell me what to do?
[208:56.15]The whole days are going by.
[209:01.21]More!
[209:02.09]Gnarly gave five community subs, even more.
[209:07.08]Yeah, now they're just coming in, like, okay, there's another, there's five from Gnarly, ten from Cyclops Parker.
[209:14.68]Jesus.
[209:16.50]Thank you, all of you guys, for these insane amount of subs.
[209:20.42]Chaining them together.
[209:23.12]Thanks for the 10, Cyclops.
[209:24.64]That's fucking... Thank you.
[209:27.98]Here we go.
[209:32.72]There's a mutagen button.
[209:33.92]Okay.
[209:34.72]Help button is right under the yellow and black mutagen button.
[209:38.28]Yeah, dashboard, whatever.
[209:39.52]It's just like, hey, you can click help and click help and click help and click... What else am I supposed to be doing?
[209:49.19]Ten more just came in from MGS Fan and DJ Kande.
[209:54.19]Thank you, both of you.
[210:02.27]What is going on?
[210:02.83]I thought this was supposed to be a tutorial.
[210:08.53]Five more from Tingy.
[210:11.36]Thank you, Tingy.
[210:17.95]Hold on, let me just... New game for a second, hold on.
[210:23.21]Hold on a second.
[210:27.66]Help.
[210:31.80]Terrible Lizards.
[210:33.92]Let's go see what it looks like.
[210:40.58]Look at all these fucking community subs coming in.
[210:42.44]Oh my god.
[210:44.32]Ten more from JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[210:49.23]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[210:52.59]So you can switch them.
[210:53.69]Alright, so look at this.
[210:54.79]We can make... Oh my god, guys.
[211:00.05]Five more?
[211:02.21]Ten more.
[211:02.77]Five more from Jill Krungus.
[211:05.58]Oh man, look at this thing.
[211:09.20]Like a donkey starfish?
[211:16.64]Low intelligence herbivore.
[211:22.63]Should we do donkey starfish with a snake tail?
[211:29.25]Nading difference.
[211:32.51]This thing's called the triceratops.
[211:35.37]That doesn't... that's not right.
[211:39.34]Food, source, plants, nectar.
[211:42.06]Okay.
[211:42.34]I feel like this is a very elaborate simulation.
[211:47.84]We probably have to be here for a while.
[211:50.59]What about the other animals?
[211:52.07]You guys are still going.
[211:55.07]Nat 5 community subs.
[211:56.19]Multi-trip 5 community subs.
[211:57.43]You guys are still... This is like a legit sub train right now.
[212:04.43]You guys are fucking going nuts.
[212:09.31]Thank you to all of you.
[212:10.73]That's like 100 community subs.
[212:13.13]That just threw in here right now.
[212:15.65]Thank you guys.
[212:16.13]Alright, make it so.
[212:21.80]Let me go back out here.
[212:27.50]What is this?
[212:28.58]Mutagen?
[212:34.06]Build world.
[212:37.54]Click on any of the control names for help messages when you have set parameters that you prefer.
[212:42.24]You can make a new world.
[212:44.58]Add more lakes.
[212:45.26]You can just change the parameters.
[212:46.68]That's interesting.
[212:51.70]Barriers, mutagens, toxins.
[212:56.95]No, I don't want to do that, though.
[213:00.43]Never mind.
[213:00.89]Oh my fucking god.
[213:06.51]Look at this thing.
[213:11.27]I have nightmares about these kind of animals.
[213:13.55]20 community subs from Ampharic.
[213:16.44]Ampharic dropping hundreds of dollars tonight.
[213:24.03]Thank you so much, Ian Farrick.
[213:27.51]20 more.
[213:28.07]What is this?
[213:31.93]You can, like, paint?
[213:37.20]Five more from 420Squid.
[213:40.46]We are just going all out community subs right now.
[213:45.01]You can do custom art.
[213:50.98]Thank you guys, for real.
[213:52.00]Like, this is fucking ridiculous.
[213:53.76]Anytime you guys do this shit, I just can't even believe it.
[213:56.18]Thank you, everybody.
[213:58.76]Big Saturday subs.
[214:00.52]Coming in.
[214:02.46]Uh, I'll be honest.
[214:04.16]I feel like this is gonna take a while to, like, kind of do a lot of stuff.
[214:09.70]This seems kind of like SimAnt, where you need to have, like, some time and just watch things grow and stuff.
[214:18.96]Seems like a fun simulation, though.
[214:23.86]Wait, pterodactyls?
[214:26.14]I can do sea urchins in water.
[214:28.42]Make it so.
[214:29.48]Oh, shit.
[214:33.58]Seems cool, but might take a while to do something interesting.
[214:35.26]Yeah, this seems pretty cool.
[214:40.32]I just think it would take a while for me to figure out what's going on.
[214:45.87]But I'll move on from this one.
[214:49.73]It does seem very interesting, but I think I wouldn't want to stay here and put that much time into it.
[214:56.84]But very, very, very cool.
[215:04.14]Let's come back here.
[215:08.97]Let's do it again.
[215:12.97]That was SimLife.
[215:17.94]Two or... A hundred percent!
[215:21.96]That's a lot.
[215:23.58]For... Wow.
[215:25.70]Here comes the fight.
[215:34.81]Wheel of Fortune, Doom, and Neuromancer.
[215:40.27]Do Neuromancer, you normies!
[215:46.62]Why?
[215:47.06]What is it?
[215:55.05]Why?
[215:56.75]Alright, there's no coming back from this.
[215:58.69]It's 66%.
[215:59.05]There's no way.
[216:01.15]Wheel of Fortune it is.
[216:05.11]This is a DOS version of Wheel of Fortune.
[216:07.01]This could be all over the place.
[216:09.01]It could be really good or really bad.
[216:10.69]Let's find out.
[216:14.46]What is this?
[216:17.54]This is a song.
[216:21.09]Why is this in Wheel of Fortune?
[216:28.35]Hit any key to begin.
[216:29.09]That's what I'm trying to do.
[216:30.81]Okay, here we go.
[216:34.91]How many players won?
[216:38.39]Are you a returning champion?
[216:40.00]No.
[216:40.16]I have to earn it.
[216:42.10]Please enter your name.
[216:52.04]Okay.
[216:53.04]Uh, round one.
[216:56.79]What do we got?
[216:58.01]It's an event?
[217:03.09]Your choice.
[217:03.65]Spin.
[217:04.15]Time remaining.
[217:04.75]Wait, spin.
[217:05.71]Spin it.
[217:12.66]I'm about to lose it on... Alright, enter a letter.
[217:14.64]Let's go with, uh, E. Oh, fuck, you have to buy vowels.
[217:18.56]Oh, no, no.
[217:19.84]Ah!
[217:19.90]Ah!
[217:26.53]I forgot you had to buy bowels in this game.
[217:29.01]And you went bankrupt, Brian.
[217:30.07]Who cares?
[217:36.13]Yeah, this sound kind of hurts.

[218:24.40]I win.
[218:34.66]Turn to the center.
[218:40.66]I got 200 points.
[218:43.56]Round two of 200 points.
[218:45.94]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[218:46.50]It's not about winning.
[218:47.46]It's about getting letters and points.
[218:49.91]Oops.
[218:53.83]So I just look like an idiot.
[218:55.47]I'm just a dickhead.
[218:56.09]Okay, this is people.
[219:02.89]Uh, Don, um... Chris, um... Uh, I don't know.

[220:01.78]No, it's not like run.
[220:07.05]Oh my god, I fucking am so stupid.
[220:14.45]I just forget the rules of this game.
[220:20.60]Run?
[220:21.12]Runner?
[220:23.14]Something runners.
[220:27.60]Run?
[220:27.88]Okay, I got it.
[220:28.52]It's you.
[220:28.98]Go bankrupt.
[220:29.70]Go bankrupt.
[220:32.10]No, give it back to me.
[220:33.44]These people are stupid.
[220:37.36]U is a vowel.
[220:37.90]I'm not going to do that again.
[220:39.08]It's not runners.
[220:47.86]Spin the damn wheel.
[220:53.85]P?

[221:48.31]Texas... This is not people, this is a baseball team!
[222:08.01]Oh, this is people.
[222:09.99]The Texas Rangers.
[222:15.01]Alright, here we go.
[222:19.47]I got 1200 points.
[222:24.41]No, it should have said team.
[222:25.96]This is a title.
[222:28.86]Well, it's definitely the.
[222:39.39]It's gonna be a bunch of T's.
[222:42.63]That's nice.
[222:50.05]The Time of the Lord.
[222:55.96]No, it's not the Lord of the Rings, guys.
[222:58.50]There's a D at the end.
[223:06.27]The Word of the Lord.
[223:10.22]I think it's the word of the Lord.
[223:11.50]I think it is.
[223:21.70]The word of the Lord.
[223:23.00]That's what I'm going with.
[223:26.11]That was only one D. The time of the Lord.
[223:32.73]The land of the Lord.
[223:34.23]No.
[223:44.55]The work of the Lord.
[223:49.87]Why hasn't we done T yet?
[223:50.93]It's free points.
[223:55.93]T is actually free points.
[224:01.27]So let's see if it's the.
[224:02.28]The.
[224:04.26]Something of the.
[224:05.62]So H. We'll do H. Let's just game those points.

[231:33.84]You have to solve it.
[231:37.13]L would be the only thing.
[231:37.93]You're not going to use your free spin.
[231:40.55]Alright, I'm going to go L. Because it's Michael.
[231:44.22]And then the rest of all... It just took vowels.
[231:50.60]There it is.
[231:50.98]Alright, what did I get?
[231:51.72]300 points?

[236:02.52]She's getting really good rolls and guessing.
[236:05.36]She keeps leaning over and going like, I'm just guessing.
[236:07.85]I have no idea what's happening.
[236:10.77]And that A-E-E-A thing, I would have fucked that up too.
[236:14.07]Sorry, Pat.
[236:15.27]Better luck next time.

[240:28.64]Now that the shoe is on the other...
[240:37.88]I would have had that fucking long-ass time ago.
[240:39.66]I just keep forgetting you have to buy the vowel.
[240:47.08]It's like, oh, would you like to buy that vowel?
[240:49.00]It just deletes your turn.
[241:04.65]Alright.
[241:06.45]I want the boat.
[241:09.24]This is a person.

[258:47.83]That was three.
[258:48.91]Ford, Wheel of Fortune, and SimLife.
[258:54.55]And we also did Doom as well.
[259:04.20]Ford sucked.
[259:08.40]Why are we doing three?
[259:09.16]We do three and then we scroll.
[259:11.28]So we gotta follow the rules, guys.
[259:15.13]We gotta follow the rules.
[259:16.99]That means we're gonna scroll.
[259:22.55]Ford sucked, it didn't count.
[259:24.41]I liked Ford.
[259:27.66]Should I just do like a streamer's choice and play this?
[259:31.78]The rules are dumb.
[259:34.28]Chat picks three games that they want to see and then we scroll down.
[259:37.72]There's 4,300 of these.
[259:45.47]Alright, I'll do streamer's choice.
[259:47.35]Because I'm curious what this is.

[265:17.01]Alright, coming back.
[265:33.98]So, that, uh, we're gonna do a scroll.
[265:39.47]So we were here.

[265:53.02]So we've got, RoboCop was not up there.
[265:56.38]So this is what we got here.
[265:57.22]That looks correct.

[266:46.33]Wheel of Fortune's not currently on the list.
[266:48.13]You can't click it.

[267:09.76]Incredible Machine is the one that's being picked.
[267:12.30]So that's what I'm going to do.
[267:15.50]Thank you for voting.
[267:17.74]It's winning by a lot, so I don't think anyone's coming back from that one.
[267:24.90]The Incredible Machine.
[267:32.54]Oh, this is where you make the Rube Goldberg, right?
[267:39.42]Original Sierra game.
[267:45.76]Okay.
[267:52.92]It's like Mousetrap.
[267:53.64]We're gonna make... Let's make Mousetrap.
[267:59.30]Puzzle 1 tutorial.
[268:00.22]Put the ball in the hoop.
[268:02.44]Make the basketball go through the hoop.
[268:06.43]Sure thing.
[268:07.82]Okay, so... Let's play it.
[268:11.12]Make... This is the hoop, I'm assuming, right?
[268:12.52]Make basketball go into the hoop.
[268:18.02]So we need... Do we just place them?
[268:20.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[268:25.75]What are the controls here?
[268:26.93]It's a ramp.
[268:37.68]Like this?
[268:41.74]Do you make this bigger?
[268:44.10]Now, first of all, how do I, like, start machine?
[268:46.52]Okay, let me just see what it does already.
[268:48.18]Alright, so that's what that does already.
[268:49.56]So, like, let's clear it.
[268:55.23]So, this has to land.
[269:00.43]And, like, knock into this one.
[269:02.65]Wait, what does this one do?
[269:06.74]What is this?
[269:07.14]Is this like a machine?
[269:09.20]Power?
[269:12.72]What do I need power for?
[269:14.34]Does it have these bands?
[269:18.28]This is to move the balls, right?
[269:23.59]So this is to power a generator.
[269:26.33]And then do I have to attach the bands here?
[269:29.15]You know what I'm saying?
[269:30.13]Like, does this... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[269:34.25]So...
[269:39.61]Does this have to be attached to here or something for it to work?
[269:51.09]Okay, how do I turn this on?
[269:52.25]How do I power that?
[269:54.47]Oh, damn.
[270:00.62]Okay, hold on.
[270:01.46]Is this for wine?
[270:10.22]So then now this has to go... I have two of these.
[270:13.55]Okay, so I get it.
[270:33.95]Got to be closer.
[270:34.55]No, no, no.
[270:35.77]What the hell?
[270:37.71]Why?
[270:38.07]Alright, don't ever right-click.
[270:41.17]So now it's going to be bang, he rolls over there, bang, he rolls over there, bang, and that.
[270:44.89]Okay.
[270:45.89]There's the only difference, though.
[270:46.67]This is not... This has got to be closer.
[270:47.93]How... Does it have to hit the top or can it hit anywhere?
[270:50.38]No, that works.
[270:53.36]Alright, and then you go like this.
[271:03.58]You go like this.
[271:05.57]Done.
[271:06.19]Started.
[271:09.83]Into the hoop.
[271:12.79]Ding, ding.
[271:15.73]New password.
[271:19.93]Do you want to advance to the next puzzle or replay your solution?
[271:23.26]Advance.
[271:23.62]I know.
[271:24.00]I'm kind of getting the idea here.
[271:29.87]Alright, put both bowling balls into the metal baskets.
[271:33.39]To solve this puzzle, you must place and flip the mouse cage, and then hook up the pulley belt to the conveyor belt.
[271:42.83]Place and flip the mouse cage, and then hook up the pulley and the conveyor belt.
[271:47.25]Okay.
[271:50.00]So you get these both have to go in here.
[271:51.12]This one's already going.
[271:52.44]So that's, that's it.
[272:06.10]So now the bolsters go in, right?
[272:08.02]Oh, no, somebody... Yeah, no, no, no.
[272:09.02]I have to drop this here.
[272:12.02]This is easier than the tutorial.
[272:18.33]I did it!
[272:28.89]You must pop all the balloons!
[272:33.68]Alright, so let's just see what these do.
[272:38.14]So the ball hits the... You gotta blow it into the scissors.
[272:43.06]Okay, so we need one of these down here.
[272:53.24]Flip it.
[272:57.72]And then this one's gotta do the same thing.
[272:59.14]Flip this one.
[273:01.60]Because this thing can get destroyed by the wheel?
[273:06.96]I know.
[273:09.12]Yes.
[273:11.58]Oh, flip it!
[273:17.16]You've achieved IQ up 68 to 69.
[273:18.43]Hey, good!
[273:18.61]Hooray!
[273:29.47]My IQ leveled up.
[273:30.61]That's great.
[273:32.16]Make the bowling ball fall off the bottom of the screen.
[273:35.58]That's the bowling ball.
[273:36.28]What happens right now?
[273:38.02]So we boink.
[273:39.64]And that boinks.
[273:42.30]Yeah, I think I understand what you want me to do here.
[273:44.16]And then get this one down here.
[273:50.10]Uh, how, what, what?
[273:55.60]No, no, no.
[273:55.96]Stop right there.
[274:00.09]So... Let's see if that goes sparring.
[274:02.69]How far does the last one go?
[274:07.33]And then... knock that one, and then do it again.
[274:11.03]Okay.
[274:13.85]So this has to be flipped.
[274:18.17]The music's pretty awesome, though.
[274:23.02]This is good shit.
[274:26.10]This is really good shit.
[274:41.27]Alright, let's see.
[274:48.74]Oh!
[274:50.38]We might be off a little bit on the physics here, maybe.
[274:53.00]No, I think we're okay.
[274:56.69]And out!
[274:58.21]Yeah!
[275:01.77]Sounds like Donkey Kong Country 3.
[275:02.73]Yeah, I'm getting Donkey Kong Country vibes, you're right.
[275:11.14]Use the boxing gloves to punch the baseball up to the metal pipes.
[275:16.31]Punch the baseball up to the metal pipes.
[275:18.77]What happens right now?
[275:20.03]This rolls.
[275:21.85]That punches.
[275:26.96]So we got, let's see.
[275:29.02]Basketball punches that ball.
[275:30.64]This ball goes down here.
[275:34.22]This ball needs to be punched.
[275:37.37]So actually, hold on.
[275:38.91]Can I move things?
[275:41.95]No.
[275:43.99]I can't pick anything up that's already there.
[275:50.64]Can I put this here?
[275:52.18]Because that drop's gone.
[275:58.59]I almost feel like I should put this up.
[276:06.47]Should it just go up and over?
[276:13.72]What does this do?
[276:20.99]No, not quite.
[276:22.31]What do I do with this thing?
[276:29.62]Because it has to be activated to punch.
[276:34.74]It has to go up over there, because then this has to punch this one, right?
[276:45.44]I hate when it does that.
[276:49.01]Can I flip this?
[276:50.11]Like, where can this go?
[276:52.85]No, I can only go left and right.
[276:58.75]So wait, that was probably, that was correct, but it just needs to go higher?
[277:01.33]I just learned this?
[277:03.68]Last puzzle?
[277:16.85]Literally one IQ, I'm just like... Yeah, I just did it.
[277:25.69]But like, this has to go, doesn't it have to go up?
[277:29.43]Hold on, what if I do it here?
[277:31.29]Can I do it up and like over again?
[277:32.71]Like, what if I do this?
[277:38.92]No, stop!
[277:55.67]I didn't think I could fit it here.
[277:58.53]I tried to put it here before.
[277:59.73]I didn't think I could even fit it.
[278:00.93]Yeah, I would have done that first.
[278:04.49]It's just I didn't think it would even... It looked like it didn't fit.
[278:12.97]Yeah, I didn't think that was going to fit down here.
[278:15.34]Look at... See the white?
[278:17.82]It's like going over the... I didn't think that was going to fit.
[278:21.58]Alright, well now...
[278:28.07]and then you go like this punch the ball go for it too far just prone up
[279:04.05]Make Mort the mouse run in his cage!
[279:08.64]Spring.
[279:09.38]Let's just put him right here.
[279:14.68]Just doing random placement.
[279:22.06]You gotta use all four.
[279:24.76]Where do they bounce to?
[279:25.44]Let's see.
[279:25.82]Right... There!
[279:28.38]Right there.
[279:34.61]Further in.
[279:37.77]Further in.
[279:38.81]Yes.
[279:50.76]Is that gonna reach?
[279:51.34]I don't think that's gonna reach.
[279:56.72]Oh, fuck, it's not.
[279:59.06]Okay, so it's gonna be a little bit further.
[280:02.74]Can I move this one a little bit?
[280:06.78]Each one's, like, one to the right?
[280:08.10]Hmm, not really.
[280:09.76]Lower?
[280:10.82]Lower?
[280:23.01]Now does it... I wonder, does it matter how far it falls?
[280:29.31]Okay, there we go.
[280:36.34]No, I don't think steeper is gonna be better.
[280:38.62]Yeah, it's definitely lower.
[280:56.91]How far does it go the first time?
[280:57.97]No, so there's actual physics in the game.
[281:03.49]That's what I was wondering.
[281:04.17]So it will fall... The more it falls... It's a DOS game.
[281:08.38]I don't think it had actual real physics in this.
[281:20.16]That should do it.
[281:25.16]Alright, we'll do one or two more.
[281:36.54]Make the Jack in the Box break the fishbowl.
[281:38.44]You got it.
[281:42.18]Jack in the Box.
[281:42.86]Let's just see what happens right now.
[281:43.88]Okay.
[281:47.19]There he goes.
[281:49.77]So we just have to make the Jack in the Box happen.
[281:52.97]Goes up.
[281:53.49]We got two Jack-in-the-boxes here.
[281:58.77]What does this do?
[282:03.54]pretty good hamburger music, yeah.
[282:05.82]So then this jumps up, and that bounces over here, which will turn this... Let's see here.
[282:15.07]Oh, God.
[282:16.39]Okay, why even have a right-click?
[282:18.63]No, come here.
[282:24.29]That's it.
[282:36.44]Oh, no.
[282:37.76]Right here.
[282:39.52]Do it again.
[282:43.99]Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[282:46.45]Break the tank.
[282:51.97]We killed the fish.
[282:54.32]Alright, a couple more.
[282:56.38]One or two more.
[282:59.08]That's it.
[283:01.72]Pop the balloon.
[283:02.78]Note that you must flip the windmill to select which direction it turns.
[283:07.72]Pop the balloon.
[283:08.58]What happens?
[283:11.22]Okay, we've got a windmill.
[283:14.88]Are windmills just wind?
[283:16.84]Sure it is, Jeremy.
[283:19.50]There's no power here, though, so you have to do... I wonder if there's a way... Wait, can I connect this to this now?
[283:33.01]Every genre.
[283:33.63]There's a lot of tracks in this game, strangely enough.
[283:36.35]What does this do?
[283:38.62]Do I need to place this in this particular place?
[283:40.66]Because do I have to like hit it with something?
[283:42.08]Does it have to spin?
[283:43.42]It does.
[283:44.76]Okay, so you need to have the wind spin.
[283:46.32]So we have to put one of these down here.
[283:47.46]Which will spin that.
[283:54.99]You have to hit it with something.
[283:58.09]So this has to go over here and then push this for that to move over here.
[284:05.14]I'm generating clean energy.
[284:06.46]Alright, well I can move this one.
[284:09.30]Doesn't really do anything.
[284:16.33]Another windmill to push that all the way?
[284:19.09]Will this move?
[284:25.26]Hold on a second here.
[284:26.10]Let me just do this.
[284:27.70]Can I move this one too?
[284:28.60]No, just that one.
[284:32.40]Because then this has to be tied to this windmill, right?
[284:35.40]I'm going to bring this back over here.
[284:41.61]Which moves it that way.
[284:43.89]So I need to flip this.
[284:46.99]You go all the way over there.
[284:48.03]That drops.
[284:49.15]And then in the meantime, that will hit this windmill.
[284:52.57]Well, not windmill.
[284:54.94]This thing.
[284:55.42]Spin it that way.
[284:59.32]Attach the cord.
[285:02.74]And we should have a finished product.
[285:06.54]No, no we won't.
[285:08.14]Wrong way.
[285:15.97]Now it's a finished product.
[285:21.87]Aww, it was in the right spot at the beginning.
[285:34.22]Nice.
[285:37.30]This is fun.
[285:39.84]This is a fun little game.
[285:45.82]Your goal is to lower all three buckets.
[285:47.70]To do this you must cut both ropes with the scissors.
[285:50.47]So we're going to cut all the ropes with the scissors.
[285:55.61]We're going to drop the buckets.
[285:58.85]What happens?
[285:59.89]It just drops.
[286:01.69]Lower the buckets.
[286:02.55]Cut the rope.
[286:04.89]So just out of curiosity, will that cut if I... Okay, so that cuts two of them.
[286:13.62]So we need to have... Hmm.
[286:18.41]Are scissors here?
[286:20.23]Gotta cut them both, so we need...
[286:29.57]Like this.
[286:30.56]Because that'll just drop, right?
[286:32.18]I think that's it.
[286:33.10]That's it.
[286:33.64]You're right.
[286:34.12]Every genre of music is in the game.
[286:36.46]Gun.
[286:36.56]Alright.
[286:36.90]Bang.
[286:37.18]Bang.
[286:37.52]You must shoot all three guns.
[286:43.26]Shoot the guns.
[286:45.60]You have to pull the...
[287:00.48]Okay, that shoots.
[287:02.62]So we have... You have to tie the gun... To... A rope.
[287:11.06]And then a rope to something else.
[287:13.70]Oh, look at all that.
[287:17.61]To a bucket.
[287:18.79]I mean... Let's see, you gotta get this to here.
[287:23.51]To there.
[287:25.05]And then we have one more of these.
[287:26.51]There aren't any more buckets, though.
[287:28.23]Alright, so what happens first?
[287:31.34]Oh, that just shoots.
[287:32.32]That's it.
[287:33.21]Hold on.
[287:33.97]Wait a minute.
[287:36.85]Can I just, like, fuck this whole thing up and just do it stupidly?
[287:39.23]Too far away?
[287:44.59]I wonder if I can just do this just dumb.
[287:49.08]Oh, you can only have one.
[288:03.25]Go here?
[288:07.06]That should work, right?
[288:12.48]No, not quite.
[288:13.34]Something has to weigh this down.
[288:15.20]Other side?
[288:15.62]There's this balloon.
[288:17.16]What's the balloon for?
[288:33.36]How do I... I want to get this back.
[288:34.82]There we go.
[288:39.50]Is this enough tension to do this?
[288:44.26]On the other side?
[288:44.80]There it is.
[288:46.44]Yeah!
[288:46.92]Alright.
[288:47.56]I'll do a couple more.
[288:48.70]And then we're going to move on.
[289:03.68]So this is a turn on all the fans.
[289:07.05]You must flip the light switch to provide power to the electrical plug.
[289:10.29]The initial state of all plugs is off.
[289:14.07]So we have to turn on all the fans.
[289:16.19]Power is power.
[289:17.28]Okay, so we got to do this.
[289:25.78]I mean, we've got to bounce the ball because it's turning it off.
[289:30.71]and then where does that go a fan maybe because that's just going to flick it on and then the fan will well you probably will this blow into here
[289:48.18]What if I... I need power for this though, don't I?
[289:54.23]I don't have to connect these?
[289:56.79]What happens if I do this?
[289:58.59]Hmm.
[289:59.11]Oh, okay.
[290:00.33]There we go.
[290:19.09]So that flicks that up, that flicks that up, and then the ball... is... gets blown.
[290:29.72]Alright, well how do I get that?
[290:35.46]It's almost like the ball... Because then this blows over here, but what do I do with that?
[290:51.15]The ball powers this, which blows the balloon, which then knocks into there.
[290:58.16]Well, how do I get this one to stay on?
[291:00.22]Can I just blow this from here?
[291:01.94]No, I can't.
[291:02.50]Maybe I can.
[291:05.58]Let's see if it'll just do it.
[291:09.04]That's flicking it.
[291:09.68]Wait, that's... Oh.
[291:14.18]I thought it was turning it off.
[291:17.35]Never mind.
[291:26.71]Okay.
[291:30.69]They all started off.
[291:31.53]Yeah, but when you see it in practice, it's like, wait.
[291:35.22]Shouldn't the foot switch me up?
[291:36.42]Alright, this is the last one.
[291:44.47]And then we're going to move on.
[291:45.75]We'll do like one or two more games.
[291:51.02]Okay, so... Going, going.
[291:51.68]So I need... More cowbell.
[291:53.14]Uh, actually, hold on.
[291:53.78]Go...
[292:21.84]Can I not move that?
[292:22.44]Can I have another fan?
[292:24.06]Oh, excuse me.
[292:24.88]Uh, alright.
[292:25.82]No, no, no.
[292:26.60]Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[292:27.72]Not enough?
[292:50.67]Not enough power to get that to blow this way.
[292:52.67]I mean, it kind of is, but not really.
[292:57.31]Um... Windmill?
[293:03.74]Windmill connected to here.
[293:06.32]The thing is, though, I knew... What did these do again?
[293:13.35]I kind of just glazed over when I was reading that.
[293:28.42]Windmill to power the generator.
[293:30.44]But... Hold on.
[293:31.96]Back it up.
[293:32.35]I want to read that again.
[293:34.75]I just read it out loud without even comprehending what was going on.
[293:37.39]How do I go back?
[293:38.19]Is there a way to go back?
[293:46.89]Because there's two new items and I just didn't even comprehend what they were doing.
[293:53.34]I can't do it.
[293:54.02]Hmm.
[294:07.55]Right.
[294:07.75]Alright, make the tennis ball fall down.
[294:12.34]Generators will take turning motion and provide electricity.
[294:17.86]The motor, okay, so this is a running then.
[294:22.90]So this is a generator.
[294:23.82]So what the hell is this?
[294:25.26]Electric motor?
[294:31.54]Which one of these is, what is, this is a motor now.
[294:50.45]Alright, so this one is powered already.
[294:53.29]So I don't need this because it's plugged in.
[295:02.83]So will this spin?
[295:04.32]That spins this.
[295:07.20]Does this need to be... Do I actually need to connect this?
[295:12.38]So the windmill turns from here.
[295:15.32]Which in turn, will that turn... No.
[295:17.14]Oh my god.
[295:24.63]Get this off.
[295:30.13]Because then that probably... Okay, now this will power that, which then will power... the- this?
[295:50.13]What is this thing for?
[295:56.81]This powers the switch.
[295:58.53]Does this need to be plugged in?
[296:00.37]What does this thing do?
[296:02.73]What's the other fan for?
[296:08.45]Ball.
[296:08.67]The ball needs to be... Because now this is powered.
[296:20.22]So that's a generator, and then this now has power for me to attach to this, which will then knock that other one.
[296:31.77]It's got to be the other way.
[296:35.24]Which then hits that, which then bounces.
[296:40.28]Okay, so then this... Do I need them?
[296:46.18]No.
[296:51.66]that because now the rat runs but just can I pow I can't power the fan with the rat can I no
[297:20.69]And this needs to be near a switch.
[297:22.09]To work.
[297:22.57]Oh, this comes with a plug.
[297:24.45]I didn't think this came with a plug.
[297:26.78]I thought you just had to pump it in.
[297:28.82]Okay.
[297:29.30]Well, that makes it... That's... Alright.
[298:03.70]Okay.
[298:06.32]Come over here.
[298:10.32]That was fun.
[298:10.84]We did it!
[298:15.83]Hooray!
[298:16.37]Alright, that's it.
[298:21.07]That's it for Bad Rats, the prequel.
[298:26.27]I just, uh, for some- I didn't think there was gonna be an outlet attached.
[298:34.04]We are going to do one more.
[298:41.32]Don't compare this to bad rats.
[298:42.92]I mean, it's just... I'm just kidding.
[298:53.79]Let's go over here.
[298:58.91]Alright, let's do... We have, what?
[299:00.85]Was that the first one?
[299:01.55]Probably two more then.
[299:06.72]Because that was the first one in that list.
[299:08.94]So we'll do two more.
[299:12.94]That should take us to about six hours.
[299:17.16]Which is where I was probably going to end it anyway.
[299:25.09]Alright.
[299:31.51]Here we go.
[299:33.68]That was the Incredible Machine.
[299:34.84]It was fun.
[299:35.64]A little interesting little game.
[299:40.11]So we've got these here, right?
[299:44.85]I feel like these are... I feel like it's moving.
[299:46.71]Alright, here we go.
[299:50.95]One of the final two of the night.
[299:57.27]Which one is it going to be?
[300:14.73]Big business is where the scroll is on.
[300:24.26]Chat just always clicks girl.
[300:25.98]37%, how many votes are in?
[300:36.46]Alright.
[300:41.42]Looks like we're going to big business.
[300:45.82]Thank you for voting.
[300:49.30]Let's try it.
[301:01.89]Digitech Software presents.
[301:05.09]Making fucking cash.
[301:10.38]All I need is 50 bucks.
[301:12.75]I'll turn that $50 into $50,000.
[301:14.37]I'm just going to invest in gold.
[301:20.99]And then wait 500 years.
[301:22.29]Does this game work?
[301:30.18]No.
[301:31.52]Big business.
[301:32.36]Off the wall productions.
[301:37.34]Desk.
[301:37.86]So I'm the chairman.
[301:41.25]Hey, what if you have a halo above your head?
[301:42.85]You're obviously a bad guy Somebody somebody just what's gonna wipe it for falling.
[301:48.77]Why why are people falling?
[301:51.59]Why are people doing that?
[301:55.77]Okay desk about beep is Alright Do you are freaking me out start game the fortune three player one has $24,000
[302:10.60]We all start with $24,000.
[302:13.14]Wake up, it's your turn.
[302:18.28]Is this a board game?
[302:19.15]Do I have to... Why is it three minutes on the clock?
[302:24.29]Too much caffeine can make you nervous.
[302:27.97]Oh no.
[302:30.39]Borrow, repay, profit, losses.
[302:33.98]You left the vault open and someone took $35,000.
[302:35.80]What?
[302:41.51]What?
[302:42.03]Who did?
[302:42.55]Do I have no money?
[302:46.93]Raw material purchase.
[302:48.25]Gravel.
[302:51.63]Sand.
[302:52.15]Lime.
[302:54.33]Uh... I have.
[302:56.63]I've lost so much money.

[305:49.56]Player 3.
[305:50.58]Production.
[305:54.84]I'm losing.
[305:55.39]Yeah, I'm losing because somebody robbed my vault in the first 10 seconds of the game.
[306:05.26]Oh my god.

[306:36.72]Is that me in the top left?
[306:40.90]I have no idea what this is doing.
[306:45.83]I don't get a hand.
[306:51.73]Trading for sand.
[306:52.49]Here we go.
[306:57.80]How do I make my hand go up?
[307:06.82]This is the oddest way to teach anybody about like stocks and bonds and trading.
[307:14.59]I can't even raise my hand.
[307:23.43]Trading for lime.
[307:24.30]Alright, am I gonna get to raise my hand this time or are we gonna have to sit here like an idiot?
[307:30.70]Have to tap?
[307:41.20]I'm just... I'm just confused.
[307:46.01]It's him mashing buttons like an idiot.
[307:52.39]At least we got to see the vault get robbed.
[307:55.88]Which was funny.
[307:57.62]I guess it was funny.
[307:58.40]Alright.
[308:01.02]We'll do one more.
[308:01.70]Maybe I'll do one more streamer's choice.
[308:04.60]That sounds like a good idea.
[308:05.46]Alright.
[308:14.13]Restart.
[308:21.50]I already see streamer's choice, by the way.
[308:23.48]It's not even on this list.
[308:37.79]Lemmings 3D.
[308:43.11]Lemmings is a... It's a great game.
[308:47.59]It's kind of all over the place, though.
[308:50.49]We'll do it.
[308:50.81]We'll try it for a little while.
[308:58.64]Yeah, 50... There's tons of clicks.
[309:02.40]50% of the vote going to Lemmings.
[309:04.02]Thank you for voting.
[309:04.97]I don't think anybody is going to be able to pull that back. 47%.
[309:15.54]Here we go.
[309:27.57]So lemmings is you have to, they just walk in a line and you can't stop them, right?
[309:33.49]You just have to have each one of the lemming classes do something to get the, all the lemmings to the other side.
[309:40.99]This is 3D, right?
[309:47.74]Jelly Belly, the original Jelly Bean.
[309:49.96]They were the original sponsor of this game?
[309:52.04]Alright.
[309:58.18]So, uh, play, if I remember correctly how this works.
[310:04.85]They just walk forward and you have to have them do things, right?

[312:19.20]I can't, like, go anywhere.
[312:21.90]I need to get that one frame to, like, actually turn the camera.
[312:30.88]Oh boy, yeah.
[312:32.58]I gotta can this, unfortunately.
[312:39.61]Yeah, that would have been fun.
[312:41.45]Lemmings, especially Lemmings 3D.
[312:46.87]Because I'm not sure any actions will even work unless I catch it right in the frame.
[312:51.21]The one frame that I can do anything.
[312:54.13]See what I mean?
[312:54.51]No.
[313:00.02]No, alright.
[313:00.86]That's it.

[319:12.29]No.
[319:17.37]Thanks for the- thanks for the salty bucks.
[319:19.17]I figured it would be, like, numpad or, like, slash, dash.
[319:31.12]I tried clicking the mouse.
[319:34.32]Google the manual.
[319:35.36]Do you think that would be anywhere?
[319:39.15]Let me try this one more time.
[319:56.74]I mean, hold on.
[319:59.16]I'm doing like something weird.
[320:04.28]I'm like blocking.
[320:12.17]Am I doing that too?
[320:13.03]Am I throwing him?
[320:13.87]This is so confusing.
[320:25.70]He's just stomping on me.
[320:27.83]Maybe I should have been the cube guy.
[320:29.35]Alright, I... I can't do anything.
[320:33.83]I'm on the ground, just dead.
[320:43.70]Alright, streamer's choice again!
[320:45.02]That was... streamer's choice again.
[320:59.01]We'll do another one.
[321:01.81]I picked that one because the thumbnail was insane.
[321:03.67]It was called Tongue of the Fat Man.
[321:07.63]You don't think I'm going to click that one?
[321:14.55]Okay.
[321:16.39]Here is my other streamer's choice.
[321:23.03]This one's not going to be very long.
[321:32.10]Everyone's going to be so mad that this is the end of the stream here.
[321:34.52]You're going to be furious.
[321:44.45]Oh!
[321:47.51]How do I change that back?
[321:49.25]I don't want it to be Game Boy.
[321:52.61]No, I don't have a joystick.
[321:54.58]How do I say no?
[321:56.42]Champs.

[323:19.25]This one... This one looked fun.
[323:21.89]People were picking this one too earlier.
[323:31.45]Didn't get to go through, though.
[323:37.07]Here's the actual streamer's choice.

[326:42.65]He allowed a group of pirates to enter the castle and free criminals.
[326:47.65]Okay.
[326:50.27]Let's go.
[326:52.12]So we gotta get that guy.
[326:55.12]I got my boat there.
[326:55.98]Cool.
[326:57.28]Rent a boat and sail the seas.
[326:58.60]Explore the easy way.
[326:59.68]Yeah, I did just rent one.
[327:03.12]Continentia.
[327:05.35]Well, we gotta find Continentia.
[327:09.97]Oh.
[327:10.79]That's a big person.
[327:12.75]Your scouts have sighted a few skeletons, a few zombies, a few orcs.
[327:18.06]How many men do I have?
[327:21.82]This is Might and Magic.
[327:24.12]Holy shit.
[327:26.12]It actually is Heroes of Might and Magic.
[327:32.51]Skeletons move.
[327:33.95]I have 30 peasants?
[327:39.70]Orcs shoot peasants?
[327:40.42]Yeah, you lose a few.
[327:41.54]That's how many peasants I have, by the way.
[327:47.32]Is there a way I can attack?
[327:49.02]No, that's pass.
[327:51.18]Peasants retaliate.
[327:52.16]Alright, how do I peasants M mouse 1?
[328:01.63]Options?
[328:05.49]Okay, yeah, because you have to get close enough to attack.
[328:07.35]There, you're just going after the peasants.
[328:11.88]Okay.
[328:13.96]Why does the bow have explosions?
[328:15.24]That's a really good question.
[328:21.79]Better than Final Fantasy XIII.
[328:23.17]Alright, well, everyone's dead.
[328:24.07]I think I'm about to lose.
[328:38.80]Uh, so the way Might and Magic works... is, uh, you gotta get an army first.
[328:46.41]250 peasants are available, 10 each.
[328:48.43]You may recruit up to 40.
[328:50.65]Recruit 40.
[328:55.92]So, we gotta build an army up first.
[329:02.78]Ooh, treasure.
[329:04.08]The sign reads, Treasure Island.
[329:06.11]No shit.
[329:07.67]After scouring the area, you fall upon a hidden treasure cache.
[329:10.01]You may take the 400 gold, distribute the gold to the peasants, increasing your leadership by 8.
[329:15.73]Let's get some good, uh, morale.
[329:18.41]Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is one of the best games, like, ever.
[329:23.25]I bet, you know what?
[329:28.49]What do you guys think for a Heroes of Might and Magic 3 stream?
[329:32.62]I love those games.
[329:35.28]I feel like there's a lot of material for us to have a lot of fun there.
[329:41.70]Oh, yeah.
[329:42.60]Absolutely.
[329:47.68]Heroes of Might and Magic is a great, great, great game.
[329:55.74]We're just playing a very, very, very early suit.
[329:58.60]Is this about the same people, possibly?
[330:06.19]The Ring of Heroism.
[330:07.21]Add a piece of the map to Stolen Scepter.
[330:09.07]This just makes me want to play Heroes Might and Magic.
[330:14.71]Yeah, we'll do that very soon.
[330:17.15]We could have a lot of fun on that stream.
[330:22.73]There's a lot of material, like we were saying.
[330:24.49]I'm not ready for that
[330:27.25]I need some more minerals and shit.
[330:30.85]Now I want to play that.
[330:39.76]Get a new contract, cancel boat rental.
[330:43.68]No, didn't they?
[330:44.26]They've remade Might and Magic 2, didn't they?
[330:46.52]And it was kind of a flop.
[330:48.74]Didn't they come back with a remaster or something?
[330:53.70]Do it right now.
[330:54.60]I can't do it right now.
[330:55.40]I'm about to stop streaming.
[331:01.78]Okay, actually I have to pull up a calendar for next week.
[331:04.14]I gotta figure out what's going on here because of my colonoscopy.
[331:06.01]Let's see what's going on.
[331:07.79]The remaster was bad.
[331:08.89]Yeah, I remember they kind of redid it.
[331:14.33]Let me just... Hold on, I gotta look at a calendar.
[331:19.98]Today's Saturday.
[331:22.40]So we went Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[331:24.38]I need to take three days off from my colonoscopy.
[331:28.00]You know what?
[331:28.32]Here's what we'll do.
[331:36.05]So this, exactly one week from today, is my appointment.
[331:42.11]The day before, I can't do anything.
[331:44.89]And maybe, potentially, it depends on how I feel about the day after.
[331:48.29]It should be okay.
[331:49.68]But at least Friday and Saturday, I won't be live.
[331:53.92]So what we'll probably end up doing here is I'll come back on...
[332:02.67]We'll do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[332:06.00]And then probably Sunday.
[332:12.91]That sounds about right.
[332:17.23]I just need to look at it on a calendar.
[332:18.95]Tuesday, Wednesday, because then they'll give me the day there.
[332:25.14]So Tuesday, I can tell you exactly what we're doing.
[332:28.58]Tuesday, we're gonna finish Sam & Max.
[332:31.06]At least try to get, you know, a couple episodes in.
[332:34.18]Because I was supposed to do it yesterday and the day before, but all the internet bullshit stopped it from happening.
[332:40.45]That was really the start of when it got real bad.
[332:46.37]And then Wednesday and Thursday... Maybe I'll play Might and Magic.
[332:54.28]Now I'm really into that.
[333:03.48]Those of you that don't know what it is, it's really interesting.
[333:13.61]Yeah, so then we'll do Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday.
[333:17.79]That's probably what's going to happen.
[333:22.11]Alright.
[333:24.13]Let me zoom back in here, because I was gonna go tomorrow too, but I feel like taking the days off would... Because then I would be, that would be four days in a row.
[333:35.68]And that's what I, but then the fucking shit next weekend, and then all the internet bullshit.
[333:39.76]I think that plays out better doing it here instead, in the middle.
[333:45.87]This guy's just fucking following me around.
[333:55.20]Today is Saturday.
[333:55.76]Well, it's getting late here.
[333:58.51]I don't want to attack.
[333:59.19]No.
[333:59.75]No, no, no.
[334:00.07]Don't attack either.
[334:01.45]Well, I have to because I can't go anywhere.
[334:04.61]A few orcs.
[334:06.93]I can't wait until we fucking play that.
[334:09.91]You guys are going to love that game.
[334:11.32]I guarantee it.
[334:12.10]Do you think Heroes 2 is on the archive?
[334:22.06]Probably not.
[334:33.96]I wish I had audio.
[334:34.62]That'd be great.
[334:35.12]Does hit the road in the archive?
[334:40.24]Wait, Sam and Max hit the road?
[334:41.52]I don't think so.
[334:44.51]Yeah, I want to do this.
[334:45.23]I want to do the real deal with this one.
[334:51.01]Alright, guys.
[334:51.69]I think that's good.
[334:53.73]I think that's it for tonight.
[334:59.92]Aren't you glad you gave them 400 gold?
[335:02.20]Now you got me excited.
[335:10.26]End of the stream voice.
[335:12.28]Yeah, that's it for tonight.
[335:19.13]Yeah, I'm looking forward to Heroes of Might Magic.
[335:20.41]It's going to be fucking awesome.
[335:23.79]We're going to get through so much cool shit in that game.
[335:30.85]But that was DOS Saturday.
[335:41.35]Hope you enjoyed it.
[335:42.05]I did.
[335:42.27]Let me see.
[335:51.89]Cool.
[335:54.65]This should do... The bits and the subs and everything should take us to six hours, which is exactly what I wanted.
[335:59.97]Was it good for you?
[336:00.60]It was great for me.
[336:01.52]I hope it was great for you, too.
[336:06.70]I will see you guys again on...
[336:11.96]What are we doing here?
[336:13.32]It's Tuesday, right?
[336:14.38]Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?
[336:21.63]That sounds about right.
[336:23.69]That sounds right to me.
[336:31.87]Next time on Dragon Ball Z.
[336:42.33]Somebody in chat just said that.
[336:43.45]Why don't we get this up here?
[336:45.61]Sounds good.
[336:51.07]How long has this been on for?
[336:52.07]No, not for... Did I just turn it back on?
[336:55.75]Hopefully I don't flake out on Sam and Max.
[337:03.09]No, I wouldn't have.
[337:06.05]The only reason why it happened is because the internet was so bad, I just couldn't even stream it.
[337:10.43]And I'm not- I don't want to power through a game like that that requires... You know, tons of dialogue, tons of choices, tons of things to pay attention to, and it, you know, the internet just drops to fucking zero.
[337:26.36]And I'm gonna be honest with you here, the internet problem is gonna be a potential long-term issue for a while.
[337:35.15]Because it's just at the point right now, with us changing to a few things and then doing something, we're at 9,300 drop frames in about six hours.
[337:47.00]Which is... That's not unbearable, but it's not good.
[337:49.74]We're just barely at that level where it's not unwatchable.
[338:00.77]And hopefully... I mean, what we're hoping is...
[338:05.39]that we either get through this couple weeks of just terrible internet for some reason, or they actually do catch one of the noise problems or packet problems, whatever it is, and they get it fixed.
[338:22.90]So, are we probably gonna have to just deal with 1%, 2% potentially dropped frames?
[338:30.34]Probably for a little while.
[338:36.24]LOL.
[338:40.89]Oh, it's all those Call of Duty players.
[338:43.89]No, it's all good.
[338:45.85]But, I'll see you later.
[338:47.13]Have a great rest of your weekend, guys.
[338:50.81]The last few days have been very, very fun.
[338:52.61]I've had a fucking blast on these three days here.
[338:57.07]I'll see you for another three days in a row on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday!
[339:05.42]Get some rest, get some food.
[339:09.97]Here's hoping that over the next couple of days... I'm gonna be running tests.
[339:16.09]I'm just gonna be streaming to the test servers all tomorrow.
[339:18.55]And I'm gonna try to catch a bad moment.
[339:21.73]So I can just immediately fucking call this person.
[339:24.93]I'm gonna go for it.
[339:25.59]We'll see if I can get it.
[339:28.47]So, let's do the bits.
[339:30.30]Go back about six hours ago, we had five dolls from Dr. Steen.
[339:33.60]Thank you, Dr. Steen.
[339:36.00]It's been at least a few years since I've seen these movies.
[339:38.28]I read the book, like, years ago.
[339:39.81]I kind of don't remember who you... Oh.
[339:42.23]Talking about The Hobbit.
[339:48.85]Thank you, Dr. Steen, for the $5.
[339:52.01]We had a ton of community subs today, guys.
[339:53.79]Thank you.
[339:54.25]That was a lot.
[339:54.81]It was like 100-something.
[339:56.31]At least like 150 or something.
[339:57.99]That's a lot of fucking subs.
[339:59.27]Thank you.
[340:02.13]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[340:03.05]You guys are fucking too kind.
[340:04.79]Seriously.
[340:08.15]Thank you.
[340:09.86]We also had 250 from C4G.
[340:11.66]Thank you, C4G.
[340:12.56]You will be kissed on the nearest possible Friday by the love of your life.
[340:15.86]Tomorrow will be the best day of your life.
[340:18.06]Now that you've started reading this, don't stop.
[340:20.46]This is so freaky.
[340:22.30]But if you read this and ignore it, you will have very bad luck.
[340:28.96]Send this to 15 people in 144 minutes.
[340:31.66]When you're done, press spacebar and your crush's name will appear in big letters on the screen.
[340:35.30]And this is so freaky, it works.
[340:44.92]I mean, does it work if I send it to 2,000 people?
[340:53.47]Because, I mean, I just did.
[340:59.91]Yeah, it has to work now.
[341:01.05]Like, 2,000 people got that.
[341:05.50]Thank you, C4G, for the $2.50.
[341:08.38]Hey, Groove Wizard!
[341:09.20]Thanks for the 250, Groove Wizard.
[341:11.36]Jeremy, I just want to give you some thanks to, you know... Give some thanks to you now that I have some bits money.
[341:17.17]This year's been the worst year of my life, as I've recently been doing very bad in school, and ended in a long-term... and ended a long-term relationship.
[341:24.40]I only recently started watching you, and I BWD well almost every stream.
[341:28.88]As the year has gone on, watching your streams, I'm slowly getting my life back together.
[341:33.38]I passed all my classes this semester, and have a somewhat stable job working for my dad.
[341:37.96]So thanks for keeping me sane.
[341:39.88]I'm really glad to hear that things are turning around.
[341:49.92]Much love to you.
[341:51.96]Welcome to the stream.
[341:56.28]You said you only recently started watching.
[341:59.03]We're glad to have you.
[341:59.73]Welcome to the community.
[342:00.41]I don't know how long you've been around, but thank you.
[342:06.83]We have a lot of... There's a lot of good people here.
[342:08.65]A lot of fun, interesting, funny people.
[342:14.14]You'll fit right in.
[342:14.96]Everything's great here.
[342:17.52]And much love to you.
[342:19.72]Anytime somebody says something like this, I always just think about...
[342:25.33]You're getting your life back together, and that's so good.
[342:29.63]That's really good.
[342:31.43]That's very good.
[342:34.47]If I had even a tenth of a percent of something to do with that, I'm floored.
[342:41.18]I'm fucking grateful.
[342:42.48]I'm thankful that that can happen.
[342:47.34]So thank you.
[342:51.99]That was Groove Wizard.
[342:53.10]Thank you, uh, Tibay, for the five dollars.
[342:56.92]You should hire some Russians.
[343:05.53]Rig the debates.
[343:06.95]Okay.
[343:10.73]Yeah, I stepped on, like, the gas.
[343:13.29]I'll be honest with you.
[343:15.49]Sometimes I do this.
[343:16.75]The first, like, two to three hours of the stream, I was, like, a hundred miles per hour.
[343:23.31]And then I just like... All the air got let out of the balloon like an hour ago.
[343:32.92]Sometimes it happens.
[343:36.76]But yeah.
[343:38.52]That was a lot of fun though.
[343:43.17]Thank you for the $5.
[343:43.73]I appreciate it.
[343:46.27]Jermaline about Taco Bell.
[343:47.41]Thanks for the $2.50.
[343:51.79]JNN exclusive report.
[343:53.99]Psychotic politician Jeremy 985 Elbertson has made shocking gains in the polls recently in the state of Rhode Island.
[344:01.11]The Jerma News Network dispatched a reporter to interview a hardcore Elbertson supporter, Big Dave Mority.
[344:08.55]Mority had to say this.
[344:09.89]Elbertson?
[344:10.61]I friggin' love that guy.
[344:11.83]One time I saw him in a Taco Bell.
[344:13.15]He screamed at the manager and shit on the floor.
[344:15.50]I smoked meth with him a couple times.
[344:17.22]He's actually that crack house over there.
[344:18.98]Ha ha ha.
[344:22.93]Thanks for the $2.50.
[344:23.97]And I love how you put Taco Bell in here, and it's in your name, too.
[344:27.13]That's a good one.
[344:29.62]Thank you.
[344:29.90]Thank you, Vellamy, for the $10.
[344:33.74]Thanks for the $10, Vellamy.
[344:35.18]Jerma, you have to take things slow with a giantess.
[344:41.26]That game was insane.
[344:42.72]That was, like... That was too much for me to handle, that one.
[344:48.65]Thank you for the $10.
[344:52.79]Smelly boy thanks for the 250.
[344:54.21]Just like how active combat can lead to... Just like how active combat can lead to a feeling of uninspired by daily civilian life, you experience with a girlfriend construction set will make all of the forms of media insufficient.
[345:21.95]Are they talking about building the girlfriend?
[345:30.54]He's saying it wasn't fun.
[345:34.08]I mean, I thought it was fun for like... 10 minutes?
[345:46.05]I thought it was fun for like 24 minutes, however long it was.
[345:53.55]That game's fucked.
[345:55.47]Thank you, though, for the 250.
[346:00.38]Then we had a ton of community subs.
[346:04.90]A lot.
[346:05.80]Hundreds.
[346:06.56]There was a hundred and something, at least.
[346:13.02]Let's put them on the screen because it's gonna fly by.
[346:20.09]Your generosity never ceases to amaze me, guys.
[346:22.11]Thank you.
[346:26.41]Look at this.
[346:28.24]Just flying up the screen.
[346:34.16]That's fucking insane.
[346:41.16]The end of that was just so out of fucking... I couldn't even... I couldn't handle it.
[346:46.01]I was like, I'm not doing this shit.
[346:50.05]But to all the community subs, all the people that are
[346:53.22]subbed not from community subs just on their own right thanks all of you I look forward to each day that we get to hang out and get to laugh at and have a good time I look forward to it every time
[347:19.25]And then we had JermaLiedAboutTacoBell again for $2.50.
[347:21.97]Let's see.
[347:22.43]We've got Mike, Debra, and you, you, you, you, you, you.
[347:25.86]The Adam Sandler noise.
[347:27.40]I wonder which one is Jerma.
[347:47.12]Oh, I can't believe it.
[347:48.42]Like, I got so embarrassed.
[347:50.71]Like, the EA thing.
[347:51.77]Everyone's like, you're so dumb and shit.
[347:53.61]Like, fuck, man.
[347:55.95]I just, like, wasn't thinking quickly.
[347:57.73]That's sad.
[348:05.03]Like, the thing is, I don't have a rebuttal there.
[348:07.35]You know, hey, shut up, you guys.
[348:09.65]Leave me alone.
[348:10.82]I don't have a rebuttal.
[348:11.46]I didn't have a rebuttal for that.
[348:14.74]There is no, like, what am I gonna say?
[348:16.82]You're wrong?
[348:17.86]No.
[348:18.16]I was just so, I was just defeated.
[348:20.40]Ugh.
[348:24.51]You can't fight back with that one.
[348:25.83]You have to just be like, you gotta take the loss.
[348:28.11]And I took it hard.
[348:35.43]It's alright, though.
[348:37.41]We all make mistakes.
[348:39.33]Some of us just admit them completely, like I am right now.
[348:42.37]Made a mistake.
[348:43.17]It's okay.
[348:47.53]Imagine spelling a word wrong.
[348:49.17]Yeah, I know, I know.
[348:50.71]Alright.
[348:54.36]Hope you guys had fun.
[348:55.06]We did!
[348:55.84]It was very fun, Kim.
[349:01.30]Uh, only a few more bits to do.
[349:02.50]We had JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[349:03.96]I want to touch upon, like, the... How many subs did JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR give tonight?
[349:09.05]Like, 50?
[349:11.01]40?
[349:11.81]Something like that?
[349:13.15]It was a lot.
[349:17.54]So, thank you.
[349:18.56]You came in like an hour ago and did a huge one, so... If you're still here... Thanks a lot, man.
[349:25.81]Flugboy!
[349:26.47]We had 250 from Flugboy.
[349:27.65]So, I'll have you know, Jerma, that last night I had a fever.
[349:29.53]It was pretty much passed out when you were rambling about some Game of Thrones shit.
[349:33.85]And I fully, like, fever-dreamed... Brawn walking into my room... With you behind him...
[349:47.26]and him slapping the piss out of me.
[349:50.34]I woke up crying because I thought it was real.
[349:53.38]I still have a fever.
[350:01.82]Oh, that's some, that is some next, that's some low-key next level insult.
[350:15.13]Think about that.
[350:16.63]For those of you that are Game of Thrones fans, think about that for a second.
[350:23.44]Even if it wasn't.
[350:24.62]Even if you actually had that dream.
[350:39.18]That's fucking hilarious.
[350:41.57]Thank you, Flugboy, for the 250 and the insane dream.
[350:45.17]I wouldn't want anyone to hurt you.
[350:48.71]See, what I do is I drink, and I know things.
[350:51.67]That's what I do.
[350:55.48]Hey, Bingo Sunshine, thanks for the $5.
[350:58.74]Hope everything goes well, man.
[351:01.62]Dot, dot, dot.
[351:02.42]Hashtag play Oblivion again in 2K19.
[351:04.80]No rush.
[351:07.56]Go Bruins.
[351:08.68]Go Bruins.
[351:09.64]Fuck yeah.
[351:16.42]And finally, we had InvaderZ for $2.55.
[351:19.28]Thanks for the $2.50.
[351:22.50]I wanted to thank you because you always cheer me up when I'm down, even if I'm only able to watch pre-recorded stuff.
[351:27.77]Thank you, Jerma, really.
[351:29.01]Thank you.
[351:31.89]Every time I turn the stream off, I hope that everyone just had a good time.
[351:37.89]And I hope that people thought things were funny, things were fun.
[351:44.76]It's all I care about.
[351:45.44]Don't care about really anything else.
[351:47.82]And however I can make that happen is how I try to.
[351:58.53]So thank you for watching.
[352:00.15]Thanks for being here.
[352:00.99]Thanks for choosing to spend your time on this channel with me.
[352:09.00]You guys are fucking incredible.
[352:10.94]Thank you.
[352:11.94]Again, from the bottom of my heart,
[352:14.42]I will see you all very soon.
[352:15.50]See you on Tuesday.
[352:18.29]Sam and Max.
[352:20.17]We're gonna... I'm gonna just restart the episode because we got, like, 20-30 minutes in and it was all fucked up and I got, like, I was irritated, so... Uh, we're gonna just start it over.
[352:30.45]We'll try to get two in.
