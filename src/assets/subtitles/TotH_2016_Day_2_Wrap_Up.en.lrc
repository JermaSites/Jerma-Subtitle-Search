[02:09.75]He is the voice actor that does the scout in TF2.
[02:13.77]Also a content creator, Twitch streamer, cool guy, and he's with us in Discord for the pub section.
[02:19.74]So hi.

[02:22.24]Oh, hi.

[02:25.23]So how's it going, man?
[02:26.01]So are you... No, we don't have the pub up and running yet.
[02:29.67]Welcome to the show.
[02:31.01]How are you doing?
[02:32.65]you I'm doing good doing good I feel like yelling into my microphone every time I talk for some reason well we've been doing it we've been screaming yeah why stop now so um have you uh what have you been doing the weekend have you had chance to watch any of the event yet or not
[02:51.16]Yeah, I've been watching off and on today, and I watched a little at work yesterday, because we do that at work.
[02:56.91]Yeah?
[02:58.03]So what do you do?
[02:59.19]Is your workplace somewhere that would frown upon you watching Twitch, or they're super cool with it?
[03:04.75]No, they're cool with it.
[03:05.59]That's cool.
[03:06.17]That's good.
[03:06.77]A lot of people have been saying that to us this weekend, is that they have a cool enough job that they can just watch Mr. Slinn eat a banana at their work, and no one does anything, which is nice.
[03:16.82]Yeah, I watch Slinn eat bananas from time to time.
[03:20.61]Who didn't?
[03:21.65]I mean, I've got it on my phone sometimes when I'm just going to sleep.
[03:25.62]Where is Slyn right now?
[03:26.72]You just have to see Slyn eat that banana.
[03:28.62]Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[03:30.14]I'm going to buy him a glass of wine later probably and just, you know, see what happens.
[03:34.71]Can I have that?
[03:35.79]I'm really hungry.
[03:36.39]I haven't eaten any pizza.
[03:37.39]Somebody has to eat that.
[03:39.18]What are you doing?
[03:40.48]What is going on over on this side of the couch?
[03:44.18]Something weird.
[03:45.20]What?
[03:46.26]Yeah.
[03:47.04]Wow.
[03:47.82]So, Nathan, I mean, you obviously, you're not someone that's new to TF2.
[03:52.78]Is Tip of the Hat something that you've watched in the past, or were you aware of it at least, or?
[03:58.09]heard about it but honestly I'm I'm not new to the game but I'm fairly new to like kind of being involved with the community and stuff it's pretty cool sure yeah yeah because I mean you started streaming on Twitch like I mentioned a lot of people know you from that and you've got uh using your youtube channel and stuff like that and so uh you know people like Reddit and whoever the heck else on the internet have kind of uh gotten on board with you more so uh in the past uh I don't know when did you really get into the heavy streaming it's been within the past year right
[04:28.31]Yeah, I've streamed off and on over the past four years, but it's never really stuck.
[04:32.20]Yeah.
[04:33.38]And then I started going hardcore about April.
[04:37.42]So just like six months-ish.
[04:39.75]Cool.
[04:40.01]But it's going well, though.
[04:40.83]I mean, a lot of us obviously stream as well.
[04:42.99]We have our own channels, and we see you on there.
[04:45.87]Because Valve, you know, Valve doing that thing.
[04:47.78]Valve putting those streamers on the main menu.
[04:49.56]That works out.
[04:50.50]Thanks, Valve.
[04:51.28]Let's be honest.
[04:52.04]That's probably one of the best features for a streamer ever.
[04:54.63]That's like the coolest thing.
[04:55.77]Yeah.
[04:56.15]Yeah.
[04:56.61]And we got a $100 donation, by the way, from CC Storm Warning, donating for the snazzy medal.
[05:03.25]And it says, keep up the great work, guys.
[05:04.77]So thank you, Storm.
[05:05.73]Thank you very much.
[05:06.49]We appreciate that.
[05:07.33]And we got the shirts and the pins still available, guys, as well.
[05:12.77]Kurt, he's got a shirt.
[05:15.34]That rhymes.
[05:16.48]Wyatt, he's got a pin.
[05:17.95]That doesn't rhyme as much.
[05:19.01]No, I don't.
[05:20.49]That doesn't rhyme.
[05:22.52]Play along, my man.
[05:23.80]You got these real-life jaunty pins?
[05:26.64]Got it on my pants.
[05:28.43]I'm covering it up for no reason.
[05:31.83]It's being covered up.
[05:33.45]Just pierced your skin.
[05:34.75]So we've got some players as well.
[05:38.03]What's up, gamers?
[05:39.11]I see Gentleman Josh over here.
[05:41.54]Gentleman Josh, founder of Marketplace.tf, cheaper than the Steam Market.
[05:45.62]No trade holes.
[05:47.44]No trade holes.

[06:07.35]What map is this?
[06:08.81]Oh, it's just gold rush Great classic gold rush.
[06:12.43]It was cool of valve to give us one map in the game this weekend We got a 50 dollar donation from dinner 198
[06:21.10]who says massive thanks to everyone who puts in the time and effort to make tip of the hats happen every year TF2 holds a special place in my heart and to see the community coming together for such a great cause is impressive to say the least keep being awesome
[06:33.22]How about you keep being awesome?
[06:34.76]You keep being awesome.
[06:36.04]Yeah, you.
[06:36.50]You are.
[06:36.86]No, you.
[06:37.55]You do.
[06:37.99]You do it.
[06:38.63]And we also have a $20 donation from Dr. Cube who says, can we get a comparison between Kurt and Nathan's bonk so we can know whether or not they are the same person?
[06:49.55]Wow.
[06:49.65]We have to wait until tomorrow.
[06:51.05]We have to hit the donation incentive.
[06:53.01]Thank you, Dr. Cube.
[06:53.97]We hit it.
[06:54.86]Now, Kurt, maybe you could give us your bonk for free.
[06:57.58]No.
[06:59.78]No, that was the no command.
[07:01.18]Maybe you give me your bunk later after the stream goes offline.
[07:04.73]Yeah.
[07:05.41]If you know what I mean.
[07:07.43]And then $100 from Large Frenzy, who says, those kids need this way more than I ever will.
[07:13.24]Thank you, Large Frenzy.
[07:13.90]Thank you so much.
[07:14.42]Thank you.
[07:15.16]That's really cool.
[07:15.98]Large Frenzy.
[07:18.05]So, Nathan, I'm going to try not to ask you all those annoying questions that you get a trillion times in that, but...
[07:25.18]I don't know if we've seen you in the pub here yet.
[07:27.74]Do you have a main class that you like to pub with the most?
[07:30.26]I know a lot of people would expect the Scout, but I feel like that's probably not the case.
[07:34.01]I see you playing Hoovy a lot.
[07:35.15]There you are.
[07:36.35]Yeah, before I answer your question, I want to answer it with a question of my own.
[07:39.47]Sure.
[07:40.73]Why does everyone think that I would play the Scout just because I've lost the Scout?
[07:44.82]Well, I don't know.
[07:45.86]Some people are small-minded and they assume things.
[07:49.52]Well, you know what happens when you assume?
[07:51.59]What happens?
[07:52.97]Sometimes you could be in error, yeah.
[07:55.33]That's a wrong, yeah, yeah.
[07:56.75]Sometimes you weren't right.
[07:57.88]But I've seen you play the heavy.
[07:58.96]Actually, I saw a video recently where you had the bread fists on as the heavy in real life.
[08:04.29]You were cosplaying the bread fist heavy.
[08:06.73]So are we to believe maybe you're a heavy kind of dude?
[08:10.86]I identify as a fat man.
[08:13.70]Yeah.
[08:15.50]Why is that?
[08:16.56]What is it about the fat?
[08:19.21]Winter.
[08:20.24]Yeah.
[08:20.88]Oh, so just sort of like you can consume the fat to sort of for energy.
[08:25.31]And your clan tag is barbecue.
[08:28.24]Yeah.
[08:28.54]So that works too.
[08:29.94]Yeah.
[08:30.74]Stupid.
[08:31.20]Sometimes I use that name.
[08:32.45]It's not that I use it, but I get called it sometimes.
[08:36.59]So taking the oops here right off the bat.
[08:40.00]Let's see here.
[08:41.02]So there's something about this opening moment here that's just so magical, isn't it?
[08:45.76]On the Dust Bowl.
[08:47.08]When the gates open and everyone runs through.
[08:49.25]Something just so lovely about that.
[08:51.43]What do you like about that?
[08:52.88]I don't know.
[08:54.36]I mean, some people run in and they die immediately.
[08:56.52]You'd have your standard Ubers that come out.
[08:59.05]I usually wait five or ten seconds for the stupidity to clear away a little bit.
[09:04.68]Make my way out.
[09:05.44]I love just going right out there.
[09:06.80]Use the flank entrance.
[09:09.35]We don't waste any time.
[09:10.67]The gate opens and you just go.
[09:13.77]It doesn't matter what you're playing as.
[09:15.35]Get out there.
[09:15.94]Get it.
[09:17.26]Go get it.
[09:18.76]You're going to respawn in like three seconds anyway.
[09:20.82]That's true though.
[09:21.30]That's a good point.
[09:21.88]Not a big deal.
[09:22.40]What if you get out?
[09:23.23]Raze is giving people the business right now.
[09:25.47]The family business.
[09:26.65]Yes.
[09:27.07]Give them the business.
[09:28.43]It's a family business.
[09:29.53]Yeah, you're still gonna have good aim with that family business, though, but I think Big Raze has got us covered.
[09:33.22]That is you on your own name, isn't it, Raze?
[09:35.38]What, Big?
[09:36.36]Raze at Fire?
[09:37.45]Oh, yes, yes, hello, that's me.
[09:39.39]This medic, completely oblivious, he just ran in and dropped the medic and got away almost.
[09:45.16]Amazing.
[09:46.54]How's the gameplay been on, uh, what's the level of, you know, intelligence and skill of the players on here without offending people watching, of course?
[09:55.29]And that's open for anybody.
[09:56.39]I think it's above average.
[09:57.55]I'm gonna give these guys some credit, Mike.
[09:59.01]Yeah?
[09:59.27]Yeah.
[09:59.39]I think it's above average.
[10:00.09]We got some of our guys in there.
[10:01.23]We got, uh, Nathan, of course, we mentioned.
[10:02.93]We got Whisker, Raze, Geel.
[10:05.42]Uh, I can't vouch for, uh, I don't know everyone in there.
[10:08.46]There's Big Juicy Jim.
[10:10.26]He's in the DH.
[10:11.74]A designated hitter.
[10:15.92]I believe that's what that stands for.
[10:17.16]We got $30 from Celenda, who says, hi, first time donating, and I really love what you guys are doing.
[10:22.97]Thank you.
[10:23.45]Thank you very much.
[10:24.43]I've heard a lot of those first time donators, which is really cool.
[10:26.77]A lot of people who are saying, for example, that they've watched in the past, but they haven't had a job maybe, for example, or they've been in school, and now they finally can, which is so cool.
[10:35.44]People are always thinking about this event, which is awesome.
[10:38.56]It's amazing.
[10:40.91]So we, boy, that cart kind of moved real quick.
[10:43.57]We can't see here on our screen.
[10:45.36]We can't see where the payload is at, but that cart, boy, oh boy, getting pushed.
[10:49.68]It's a Gold Rush anomaly, really.
[10:51.85]Oh, yeah.
[10:52.37]Cart gets pushed that fast.
[10:53.83]Yeah, it kind of really is.
[10:55.05]Have you guys heard my bit on Gold Rush being a slow map?
[10:57.95]What's the deal with Gold Rush?
[11:00.74]Oh, my gosh.
[11:03.35]Instantly tradable.
[11:07.92]Speaking of Geel, tipofthehats.org just donated $100.
[11:12.31]How is that possible?
[11:13.67]How is that possible?
[11:16.19]Apparently you did.
[11:18.44]Wait a minute.
[11:18.84]This is Jerma985.
[11:20.32]What the hell?
[11:24.59]That's what it says on the thing.
[11:26.49]This is my obituary.
[11:28.48]What the heck?
[11:29.70]We're on the next phase of the map.
[11:31.13]The next phase.
[11:32.47]This is tomorrow's newspaper.
[11:38.12]No trade holds.
[11:39.98]Instantly tradable, as Kurt put it.
[11:43.08]Have you guys spent a lot of time thinking about your obituaries?
[11:45.70]Like, have you thought about what you wanted to say?
[11:47.58]It's just taking a dark turn.
[11:49.40]No, I mean, in a good way.
[11:50.93]All of a sudden.
[11:51.73]I don't mind to be like, Geal, he never held a trade.
[11:54.93]Never held a trade.
[11:55.67]That's it.
[11:56.83]Yeah.
[11:57.77]No trade holds.
[12:00.62]This guy was cheaper than the Steam market.
[12:04.04]I don't know.
[12:04.86]I hope mine mentions my UGC league history on mine.
[12:09.89]I'll give my parents my member page on UGC, perhaps.
[12:13.03]Just link them your Steam profile.
[12:14.47]You got your resume there.
[12:15.47]Yeah.
[12:15.91]There you go.
[12:16.50]That's true.
[12:17.08]I do it.
[12:17.94]I do that.
[12:19.34]Do it.
[12:19.56]I do that.
[12:20.16]Do that.
[12:21.28]We passed 109.
[12:22.02]109.
[12:23.59]Hi.
[12:24.07]So, again, we have this magical moment at the spawn doors where everything happens, nothing happens.
[12:28.23]Oh, come on.
[12:28.57]Get out there.
[12:29.03]Alright, Nathan.
[12:29.65]Get it.
[12:29.98]Yeah, come on.
[12:30.54]Get right down the throat, Nathan.
[12:32.28]Jump down the throat.
[12:33.50]I'm in the hole.
[12:35.16]I'm in the hole.
[12:36.79]You got medics on you.
[12:37.73]That's the nice thing about people knowing who you are in a pub is you got the medics.
[12:41.31]Look at this.
[12:41.97]Spawn Camperino.
[12:43.45]Jump spin up over the Devilman.
[12:45.30]Oh, wait, wait a minute.
[12:46.22]Oh, boy.
[12:46.60]Wow.
[12:47.70]We got some invite tactics.
[12:49.16]That demo tried to jump over.
[12:50.60]That jump rev might get Sean Bud's jump revs to run for his money, you know?
[12:54.15]Might have to have a jump rev race.
[12:56.05]And the jump off, that'll be, yeah, the jump rev will be later on this evening.
[13:00.52]The jump spin up competition.
[13:02.91]I think I learned that at valve.
[13:04.48]That's how that that's how they gave it.
[13:05.98]Oh, yeah So when you walk in valve do you have to do a jump spin up around the corner?
[13:10.46]How do you get through the door?
[13:11.88]Yeah, it's all 90-degree angles Don't they have like a giant sentry in the lobby or something you can't just go in unprepared Eat a puff you know you need a buck you need a buff They give you that like before you go through the doors.
[13:25.18]Yeah, you need a buff.
[13:25.82]That's a good point kind of like life.
[13:28.34]Oh
[13:29.24]We have $7 from Anonymous, who has a very heartfelt message here.
[13:33.34]It's, sorry I couldn't donate more, but I felt I really needed to do at least something.
[13:37.71]My grandmother passed away from cancer and other conditions not two weeks ago, and it's been hard.
[13:42.52]It's not until someone close to you is affected that it really starts to feel real to you.

[13:58.64]One thing about numbers, they have a way of adding up.
[14:00.82]That's what we keep saying, you know?
[14:03.43]It's true.
[14:03.91]I mean, that's just math.
[14:04.77]That's the nature of math, you know?
[14:07.47]Mathematicians just found that out right before the event.
[14:10.56]Mathematicians hate them.
[14:12.80]All these numbers add up.

[15:25.62]Do you ever get- Do you ever feel like you're the only one doing all the work on a pub team?
[15:29.69]No, see, I feel like a lot of people feel like that, but, you know, you've got to give the gamers the benefit of the doubt.
[15:36.12]Everyone's trying their best in here, and, you know, we've got differing skill levels, but it's alright.
[15:41.35]That's true.

[15:47.21]Remember that one?
[15:48.30]Tom Hanks.
[15:49.86]That's a book, actually.
[15:51.80]You've Got Mail is a book.
[15:53.28]Wait, that was a book?
[15:54.16]Yeah, by Tom Hanks.
[15:55.29]Wait, Tom Hanks wrote the book?
[15:56.81]No, he starred in the book.
[15:58.47]Oh, I thought you were talking about it's Tom Hanks wrote the book, You've Got Mail, and then starred in the movie on the book, You've Got Mail.
[16:03.48]He wrote his own book, Tom Hanks.
[16:05.82]Congratulations.
[16:06.38]We're proud of you.
[16:07.47]I think we have a donation from a friend.
[16:09.87]Do we?
[16:11.78]Is that Ster 37?
[16:15.01]There's no way that's... Ster 37?
[16:16.73]No.
[16:17.47]He wouldn't put a 37.
[16:18.47]Oh, no, no, no.
[16:19.23]Our tracker appends.
[16:19.96]There's a thing where it adds numbers to the answer.
[16:22.56]Yeah, our tracker appends.
[16:23.12]That is Ster.
[16:24.54]Ster 37.
[16:27.29]New alias.
[16:28.59]Okay, he's new alias.
[16:29.86]$300 from Ster.
[16:31.22]And he says, traitor.
[16:33.34]Well, you guys know the numbers in his Battle.net account now.
[16:36.19]Yeah.
[16:36.83]Add them up.
[16:37.55]Ster.
[16:38.07]Hashtag 37.
[16:39.45]It's only two of them.
[16:40.52]37th account.
[16:41.04]37th account.
[16:43.76]Usually there's four numbers, but not this time.
[16:47.83]I don't know.
[16:48.17]That's making me laugh so much.
[16:50.24]37th.
[16:51.91]Is he 37?
[16:52.95]Don't eat it yet.
[16:53.91]He might be.
[16:54.27]We weren't supposed to say his age.
[16:55.77]Don't eat it yet.
[16:57.38]Keep it going.
[16:58.60]Hopefully, yeah.
[17:01.32]Are you going to eat that, Mike?
[17:03.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:04.73]You're just going to let it flop around?
[17:06.93]It seems like the gravity is taking over, man.
[17:09.01]There's so much comedy going on.
[17:11.74]I can't take it.
[17:14.08]Now, you switched over to demo there now.
[17:15.50]Nathan, what was that all about?
[17:17.99]You feel like the heavy wasn't doing it?
[17:19.82]Well, here's the thing.
[17:22.42]Skill is related to the color of your weapons.
[17:24.76]I have two golds on this character, so I was just trying to impress the stream.
[17:28.23]That's true.
[17:28.69]There you go.
[17:29.59]I'm impressed.
[17:30.15]Listen, buddy, you already have us impressed.
[17:32.63]With gold or not, you could have been using a bronze weapon.
[17:35.58]Do they have those?
[17:37.08]No.
[17:37.30]Bronze.
[17:38.76]Okay, well, we'll look into that for next year.
[17:40.86]We'll try to get some of those bronze weapons.
[17:44.07]Here we go.
[17:44.83]Take him to Krixarino.
[17:46.89]Now those sentries though, those pesky sentries.
[17:49.86]That's a head.
[17:51.55]That's a head.

[18:52.67]We'll be getting burgers.
[18:54.18]Is that a place?
[18:56.01]Ray's just got a collateral on Rick Flame.
[18:58.72]I don't think I've ever done that in the history of this game ever.
[19:01.53]A legend of the sport.
[19:06.87]Boy, try talking TF2 without Rick Flame.
[19:11.26]Good luck.
[19:11.74]This guy's getting roasted for no reason.
[19:14.78]Oh, by the way, PS3IA, the guy that donated $500, says, oops, I typed an extra zero.
[19:21.57]Darn it.
[19:22.85]Too bad.
[19:23.79]No takebacks.
[19:25.71]Thank you very much.
[19:26.91]No takesie-backsies.
[19:29.66]So many players that have been inspired by Rick Flame, guys, all jokes aside.
[19:36.20]I feel like we should really keep blushing this joke out here.
[19:39.21]Let's keep running with this joke.
[19:40.47]Are we still on Gold Rush?
[19:41.99]Richard Flame.
[19:42.79]Is anybody going to vote for the next map after this round ends, or are we just going to do some Z rush?
[19:46.77]Let's just do Gold Rush.
[19:48.19]What's the big plan with that banana there?
[19:49.91]Where is this going to end up?
[19:51.84]Are you going to try fitting it into the sprite there?
[19:56.20]Please.
[19:58.60]Well, I don't have an answer to that that I can say on the stream.
[20:04.05]Not allowed to answer that question.
[20:06.59]Not allowed to.
[20:08.21]The next map being set to Upward.
[20:10.30]I bet people are going to be rocket jumping on that one.
[20:13.76]But my money's on anything at all.
[20:16.12]Game Boo.
[20:16.78]$10 from the old Razzle Dazzle who says, gave as much as I can from working a part-time job in college and selling crafts on the side.
[20:24.77]Glad it's going to a good cause.
[20:26.05]Also, I just want to hear Nate say the old Razzle Dazzle.
[20:30.11]Wait, did she say crafts?
[20:33.58]Crafts on the side.
[20:35.59]Spell that, please.
[20:36.71]I think I'm mishearing you.
[20:37.79]C-R-A-F-T-S.
[20:39.57]Crafts.
[20:40.11]Like arts and crafts.
[20:41.55]Crafts.
[20:42.09]Yeah, yeah.
[20:42.77]Crafts.
[20:43.33]Not crack.
[20:44.32]Not crack.
[20:45.34]No.
[20:45.46]Crafts.
[20:45.70]Alright.
[20:46.92]I got it.
[20:48.38]I got it.
[20:48.96]The old razzle dazzle.
[20:50.40]Yeah.
[20:50.92]There you go.
[20:51.46]There it is.
[20:52.20]There you go.
[20:52.60]There's the money.
[20:53.73]Good night, everybody.
[20:54.39]Show me the money.
[20:54.79]Thank you.
[20:55.13]Yeah, it was by the old razzle dazzle.
[20:56.69]Show me the money.
[20:57.79]Hey, do you guys remember TMA?
[20:59.23]He just donated a dollar.
[21:00.23]I saw him.
[21:00.61]A buck.
[21:00.99]Yeah.
[21:01.87]Thank you, TMA.
[21:02.82]TMA 101.
[21:03.22]Now, what does that stand for?
[21:05.00]Kurt.
[21:08.89]What does it stand for?
[21:10.63]What does it stand for, Kurt?
[21:11.79]Too many analogies.
[21:12.85]Too many analogies.
[21:15.84]70 Dollars from Anonymous says, nice job, guys.
[21:17.94]Keep it up.
[21:18.52]Are you sure?
[21:18.98]Thanks.
[21:21.37]I saw one there as well from Muselk.
[21:24.15]Now, I know people like to use people's names, so I don't know.
[21:27.58]It seemed like 100 bucks, yeah.
[21:29.06]Is it on there?
[21:29.62]Muselk, $100 from Muselk says, eat the damn banana already.
[21:33.16]I can't take this anymore.
[21:34.71]Thank you, Muselk.
[21:35.47]Who do you figure he's talking to?
[21:37.13]Somebody on the couch.
[21:39.85]Wyatt, eat the banana.
[21:42.49]Jerk.
[21:44.74]So, guys, we've moved on.
[21:45.76]We're on PL Upward now.
[21:47.36]Is this Upward?
[21:49.38]Yeah, this is the new Upward skin.
[21:50.96]It looks just like Badwater.
[21:52.14]Wow, that's cool.
[21:52.95]Wait, why is it Badwater?
[21:54.77]Yeah, I don't know.
[21:56.07]I thought it was going to be Upward.
[21:57.87]Dude, is this the first episode of Glitchers?
[22:00.05]Glitchers?
[22:00.85]We just glitched the server.
[22:02.52]Whoa.
[22:03.16]Dude, check it out on YouTube.
[22:04.52]New glitch.
[22:05.14]There's a joke two people get.
[22:08.68]What?
[22:09.99]How is that confusing?
[22:11.11]Guys, that's me and Kurt's YouTube series coming up, Glitchers.
[22:15.48]Yeah, we planned it out four years ago.
[22:17.54]Glitchers.
[22:18.34]We shot test footage, and I bought a lav mic for nothing.
[22:22.59]That's what we do.
[22:23.25]Just two dudes that love glitching.
[22:25.11]That's normal.
[22:26.05]And TMA.
[22:27.21]Yep.
[22:28.29]TMA.
[22:29.23]I think we'll figure it out later what it stands for.
[22:32.09]So maybe we are moving too upward, guys.
[22:34.44]I was right and you were wrong.
[22:36.50]We actually have a donation from, a serious donation from Femme Fatale, who says, today was the memorial service for my friend Will, who died of a rare form of bone cancer called osteosarcoma.
[22:49.81]I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[22:50.99]Here is a small donation in his honor, $30.
[22:53.17]Thank you so much.
[22:53.83]Thank you.
[22:55.39]Nice.
[22:55.98]It appears we're going to Hydro.
[22:58.52]Oh, great.
[22:59.40]Here we go.
[23:00.67]Boy, I'm glad we skipped Badwater for Hydro.
[23:04.13]This is the map that everybody says they love.
[23:06.10]Alex Van Camp giving me a big old double thumbs up.
[23:10.97]feeling extra good double thumbs up there you go you guys play the beta of this game you might have played this map before that yeah if you ever played this and if you ever played a pub in 2008 you play this all night this is the only map
[23:26.31]Seriously, Bill Nye, the science guy, used to get spammed in voice chat a lot in those days.
[23:31.10]Oh, yeah.
[23:31.62]Anyone remember that?
[23:33.30]No.
[23:33.98]Bill Nye.
[23:34.88]Bill, Bill, yeah.
[23:36.24]Can't do that anymore.
[23:37.40]Can't do that on television.
[23:38.43]That seems really, really particular.
[23:40.35]Like, why Bill Nye?
[23:41.59]And only Bill Nye.
[23:42.65]Well, memes.
[23:43.07]Memes were a thing then, too.
[23:44.21]You just didn't call them memes.
[23:45.67]Just being annoyed.
[23:46.72]Yeah.
[23:47.86]Briefings.
[23:48.96]Yeah.
[23:50.06]If I may?
[23:51.26]Sure.
[23:52.33]As a contractually obligated Valve voice actor, I would just like to say that I love this map.
[23:59.08]Oh.
[23:59.90]That sounds believable.
[24:02.93]Oh no!
[24:03.69]Contractually obligated.
[24:05.35]Something happened over here.
[24:08.98]Oh, well.
[24:11.42]There we go.
[24:12.68]It was really a ticking time bomb, Mike.
[24:14.59]Let's be honest.
[24:15.69]We all knew what was going to happen to that banana.
[24:17.30]So you're going to eat it or what?
[24:18.36]What happens next is up in the air.
[24:21.05]You've taken it out of the wrapper at this point.
[24:23.11]Just throw it up there and swallow it.
[24:27.40]No!
[24:28.78]No!
[24:29.06]We have $100 from Anonymous who says, Hi, just wanted to say hi and thanks to everyone for all the great videos you guys make.
[24:36.01]And an extra thank you to Jerma for the Shadow of Mordor video he made a year or so ago.
[24:40.89]I was on one of the QA teams and got a huge laugh out of watching it.
[24:44.72]And here's a fun fact.
[24:45.82]I was the only person whose real life name is actually from Lord of the Rings.
[24:49.40]Twilight Zone shit here that person lives in Washington State
[25:03.36]Really?
[25:04.06]How do you know that?
[25:05.68]Because I know where the studio is because I used to work at it.
[25:09.03]Oh, you do?
[25:10.57]Interesting.
[25:10.99]That's actually cool.
[25:13.24]$120.
[25:17.33]$120 from Leather Jacket.
[25:18.77]That's a mod in my stream is Leather Jacket.
[25:22.06]It says, hey guys, hey Gemma, I look forward to Toph every year more than any calendar holiday.
[25:27.06]I was going to buy a new laptop, but it can wait.
[25:29.95]The kids need it more than I do.
[25:31.03]Thank you.
[25:31.33]Leather jacket for $120.
[25:32.69]Thank you.
[25:33.69]Thank you for modding my stream.
[25:36.30]You're a good mod.
[25:38.00]Because a laptop is a material good.
[25:40.70]Yeah.
[25:41.10]Camp is an immeasurable experience.
[25:44.53]What if you bought a camp?
[25:46.39]We're going to buy a camp maybe next year, Nathan.
[25:48.59]We didn't think of it.
[25:49.75]We didn't think of it for this year.
[25:51.85]But next year, we can have that.
[25:55.10]Buy a camp.
[25:56.80]Buy a camp.
[25:57.84]Kevin Hispone with $5 says, that banana is very gross, Getawayl.
[26:03.57]Maybe give it to Tag.
[26:05.97]Rude.
[26:08.33]Why would you give it to Tag if it was gross?
[26:10.18]That was the first bite.
[26:11.70]Jerk.
[26:12.14]Sounds a little malicious.
[26:13.20]I know.
[26:13.56]That sounds malicious.
[26:15.28]Delicious.
[26:17.56]So you switched over to the pyro now.
[26:19.28]We got Nate doing his back.
[26:20.50]Oh, look at this.
[26:21.56]Oh, boy.
[26:22.86]Front burning that sentry, though.
[26:24.57]Boy, did anyone out there think that sentry had a chance?
[26:26.65]Because I sure didn't.
[26:27.43]Nope.
[26:28.01]Front burning.
[26:28.87]Are you just slowly eating that banana?
[26:31.15]Oh, he just took a bite.
[26:32.88]Have you been beating it?
[26:33.60]I haven't even been watching.
[26:35.66]Have you been beating it?
[26:39.90]My lips parsed, and I said eating, so it was beating.
[26:44.71]Yes.
[26:47.11]That was a disgusting noise.
[26:52.24]Alright, $10,000, get Mike to stop doing that.
[26:57.21]That's our new donation incentives, is to get people to stop doing things.
[27:00.66]Get him to stop.
[27:02.38]So we're on to the next part of this beautiful map.
[27:05.12]We've got Funk in the house.
[27:06.64]I saw him top scoring.
[27:08.28]Yeah, Funk's pwnin'.
[27:09.38]Or funky as people like to say if they just like to pronounce things as verbosely as they can.
[27:15.77]Well, now I feel like an idiot because I was saying something about him earlier and said funky four times.
[27:21.35]So there you go.
[27:22.38]Sounds like a personal problem.
[27:24.38]$70 from cmat17 with no message, but thank you for the $70.
[27:33.66]I very much appreciate it.
[27:38.53]We got 111 over there?
[27:39.73]$111,245.
[27:41.45]Wow.
[27:44.66]What do you think that means?
[27:48.74]Now what's the significance of that number?
[27:52.75]That is where we currently stand.
[27:54.57]Nice.
[27:55.27]So, yeah.
[27:56.24]That's very, very cool.
[27:56.76]We'll tell you what, the cool thing about that is, is this is only day two.
[27:59.50]We actually have a full day tomorrow, another 12 hours.
[28:03.79]Not a lot of people knew that.
[28:04.77]Some people are sort of used to us going through the night, and it's a 36-hour thing, but we're doing 12 a day this year.
[28:11.36]12 more tomorrow.
[28:13.07]Absolutely.
[28:13.69]And coming up tomorrow, we have a great donation incentive with Nathan here if you want to tell the good folks at home about it.
[28:19.50]Yeah, Nathan.
[28:21.02]Well, I mean, Nathan, do you want to talk about it?
[28:23.94]Yeah, sure.
[28:24.40]I was just busy, you know, carrying the game, but... Yeah, if we do hit that goal tomorrow, we're going to bust out one of these pubs and I will play the infamous Team Fortress 2 Scout character in the voice of the Scout and I will talk...
[28:43.66]Scout stuff while I talk trash to people as I carry the game.
[28:47.01]Yeah.
[28:48.07]Call people Chuckle Nuts.
[28:51.31]Perhaps.
[28:52.45]That could be a preview.
[28:54.50]That was my impression of the Scout.
[28:56.50]He's pretty good.
[28:57.30]Nonchalant conversation.
[28:58.42]Gotcha, Chuckle Nuts!
[28:59.34]Chuckle Nuts.
[29:00.57]Good day, Chuckle Nuts.
[29:01.87]$30 from Shotix184, who says, Mila, can you please just say Poodis?
[29:06.65]That's all I want.
[29:09.38]I'll say it, but not right now.
[29:10.64]Not under all this pressure.
[29:12.84]Not when all the cameras are on me.
[29:14.46]He'll say it in his natural habitat.
[29:17.85]When it happens.
[29:18.57]When I see something with a heavy on the screen happen, I'll say it.
[29:22.01]And also, I just wanted to mention, if you saw it down there, 5,000.
[29:25.19]So we're halfway to Nathan's donation incentive goal.
[29:28.74]Halfway.
[29:29.26]Close, getting close.
[29:31.18]Let's get it.
[29:31.92]Ooh, I just kicked the table.
[29:33.26]Now, Nathan, uh, Nathan, I'm... We'll see.
[29:36.31]Nathan, I'm getting a request from the powers that be here in my ear, uh, that we'd like to hear some sort of preview of the scout voice, if you could.
[29:45.18]Okay.
[29:46.30]Um, I have a question.
[29:47.26]Sure.
[29:48.90]Who's in your ear?
[29:50.87]Listen, it's my, it's my bosses, so don't, don't, don't do it to me.
[29:56.12]The people who are running the show want to get just a bit of a preview, something.
[30:00.45]Could be a word.
[30:00.99]I thought it was like Jesus or something.
[30:02.67]Oh, yeah, no.
[30:04.39]God.
[30:04.61]God lives inside me.
[30:06.21]Can you get him to give us a quick little preview?
[30:08.14]What?
[30:09.84]Somebody turn my monitor off.
[30:10.86]Can you hit us with something, a little, a tiny little thing?
[30:14.78]Yes, yes, yes.
[30:16.36]Let's see.
[30:21.03]Thinking of a line.
[30:21.69]What's that?
[30:26.06]Kind of put him on the spot there, huh?
[30:27.48]Yeah.
[30:27.92]A little bit.
[30:28.60]Okay, I got this.
[30:29.22]Hang on.
[30:29.62]You ready?
[30:30.22]Yep.
[30:31.13]I just have to warm up.
[30:32.05]It takes a second.
[30:32.73]Yeah.
[30:34.09]You can do the warm-ups on stream.
[30:36.43]Yeah.
[30:36.55]We can talk about the warm-ups in a second.
[30:37.58]I hear you have an interesting warm-up routine.
[30:39.32]Gatoel always talks about it with me.
[30:41.50]Yeah, but it's not... It's not camp-friendly.
[30:45.03]Yeah, you can't say that.
[30:46.97]Who gives a heck about glass?
[30:52.04]So, yeah.
[30:52.70]Give me like two minutes.
[30:53.62]I'll do it.
[30:53.88]I just gotta get in the character.
[30:55.86]See, this is what it takes, man.
[30:58.02]Yeah.
[30:59.17]Well, that's what I like about it is it's legit.
[31:01.31]There's a little bit left of the banana.
[31:02.61]Oh, okay.
[31:03.23]He was hiding.
[31:04.29]The cool thing is it's not just his own regular voice, you know what I mean?
[31:08.38]That's what's cool about it to me.
[31:10.11]Anyone else think that bananas are really shy?
[31:12.55]They're always hiding under the peel, you know?
[31:14.67]Well, then they show their true selves.
[31:18.24]And then you consume them.
[31:20.24]While Nate is warming up here, we have a couple of donations here.
[31:33.21]One from Tricky Wee, $150, who said, I accidentally clicked anonymous a few donations before because I'm a shpee.
[31:41.54]But he says cancer can get rough and painful lost my grandmother to it This stream is amazing, but 150 more dollars for the children and the attractive Nate voice You should let his Twitch again for the good of humanity.
[32:03.73]Yeah, so thank you tricky We can do that.
[32:06.57]We like to link twitches.
[32:08.17]We'll do that in chat
[32:09.76]And then another $50 from Kronkodile, who says, why not?
[32:13.34]Another $50.
[32:14.40]Also, if we hit 150,000, I will make a new team service announcement video.
[32:18.91]And if we get to 200,000, I'll make three in a row.
[32:21.73]Holy cow.

[32:24.62]Dangerous.

[32:28.62]That's not even possible.
[32:30.60]Can that many videos fit on the site?
[32:32.39]Three videos?
[32:33.71]You might have to call YouTube about bandwidth.
[32:35.95]I have to call Greg YouTube about that one.
[32:38.58]Ask him for the bandwidth.

[35:46.08]Yeah, well, tearjerker sounds normal, but jerking my tears sounds like something else.
[35:53.97]You can't flip it.
[35:54.91]You're not allowed to flip it that way.
[35:56.43]Can we have one segment go by where there's not some banana joke?

[37:57.59]We thought he would even show up.
[37:58.99]Rick.
[38:00.03]We haven't seen him for years.
[38:01.27]He was playing with Puda Spencer.

[38:22.15]I just love that.
[38:22.81]I'm a big Die Hard fan, Nate, so when I saw that that was your preparation, I'm way into it.
[38:29.10]I watch it every night before we record.
[38:31.80]Anytime I have to record, it's my ritual.
[38:33.88]I watch it the night before.
[38:34.84]Oh, really?
[38:35.98]When you're doing the actual... Oh, wow.
[38:37.47]That's cool, actually.

[38:43.47]I also watch it on Christmas.
[38:44.51]I mean, it's a good movie.
[38:45.60]I watch it a lot.
[38:46.22]I mean.
[38:46.58]Yeah, of course.
[38:47.56]I watch it in the shower.
[38:49.22]Yeah.
[38:50.12]TV in the shower.
[38:51.91]That would be amazing.
[38:53.09]Invent it.

[39:01.08]Flip book.
[39:01.98]Just like, wait.

[39:05.95]Yes.
[39:06.01]Draw the whole movie?
[39:08.31]Every frame.
[39:09.07]That would be like 700,000 pages.
[39:13.12]That would stand this high.
[39:16.08]How do you flip it?
[39:16.68]Your hand would get tired.
[39:17.68]Nate, that is so impressive.
[39:20.01]Nate, tell me more.
[39:21.75]Let's really dig into this thick book.
[39:25.83]Who published it?
[39:27.19]Seems illegal.
[39:29.82]It's going to be a copyright issue there.
[39:31.43]It's like the Yellow Pages.
[39:35.75]Dictionary.
[39:37.79]Barbecue, stupid, eaten up.
[39:40.69]Fill up, my man.
[39:41.51]It's actually, is it still the full moon in TF2?
[39:43.85]I think it is, isn't it?
[39:45.52]People are wearing their Halloween garb.
[39:47.36]Yeah.
[39:48.16]Any bug engineers?
[39:50.02]That's my favorite one.
[39:50.98]Yeah, I like the flies.
[39:51.82]That's my absolute favorite.
[39:52.82]The voice lines change.
[39:55.15]They get really high.
[39:56.53]Yes.
[39:56.97]It's pretty freaky.
[39:57.87]It's super weird.
[39:59.03]Freaky mansion.
[39:59.75]You might get scared.
[40:01.36]Don't.
[40:01.72]Nobody put it on.
[40:02.48]Guys, don't get too scared here.
[40:03.80]If anybody puts it on, I'm going to freak.
[40:05.66]I'm going to get real scared.
[40:06.30]I won't be able to look at the screen.
[40:10.03]Now, Nate, we never did get to the secret thing.
[40:12.28]Is it possible to get to it on different stages of Hydro, do you think?
[40:16.96]The problem is, it's such a secret, I don't even actually know where it is.
[40:22.21]It's like the cameras will shut off.
[40:23.95]You know how you can't photocopy money because it'll pick it up and just shut down?
[40:27.85]Maybe the cameras in all the games will shut down if you get to it.
[40:31.30]It detects that you're there.
[40:32.58]Hold on, you can't photocopy money?
[40:33.90]You didn't know you can't photocopy money?
[40:35.74]Guys, let's get a photocopy.

[40:37.84]Okay, you literally can't get up front try it donation there.

[41:09.89]Don't be so foolish there.
[41:11.93]All you need is a scanner and a computer.
[41:14.52]You can make millions of them.
[41:17.67]And then we got $10 from FreakyGhostBed who said, one last donation for the weekend from my meager college student funds.

[44:31.37]He says, the Bite Me Geel donation wasn't meant to be read out loud.
[44:34.66]He's my friend.
[44:35.48]Also, here's some money.
[44:36.56]Bite Me Funky.
[44:37.65]We're not friends.
[44:38.51]I don't know why you'd say that.
[44:39.51]If you don't want it read, then don't enter it in.
[44:42.47]Apparently.
[44:44.16]That's a personal issue.
[44:46.50]It's on you, my man.
[44:50.27]Yep.
[44:51.71]So we got Rick Flame here, of course.
[44:54.28]Head and shoulders above.
[44:56.60]I am out of the loop on this one.
[44:58.46]Somebody explain this to me.
[45:00.28]Explain like I'm five.
[45:02.04]It's a random name.
[45:03.50]We don't know who it is.
[45:04.25]I'm sure he's a great guy.
[45:05.85]We're just running with the joke of him being a legend.
[45:08.61]It's just Rick Flame.
[45:09.49]Just a random guy.
[45:10.95]I'm Rick Flame.
[45:11.71]Rick Flame, we're not making fun of you.
[45:13.36]We love you.
[45:14.42]I'm sure you were a great dude.
[45:16.34]We certainly mean no harm with it.
[45:18.56]It's just funny.
[45:19.82]We like to make laughter.
[45:22.12]There's rays exploding.
[45:24.37]A puff of smoke.
[45:25.75]You know who I died to?
[45:26.79]Rick Flame.
[45:28.21]No surprises there.
[45:29.30]Could have guessed.
[45:31.30]Rick Flame.
[45:32.14]Legend of the sport.
[45:34.71]Rick, if you're listening, could you make that your name on Steam?
[45:38.14]Rick Flame.
[45:39.50]Can you guys tell Rick in game chat to change his Steam name to that?
[45:43.00]I'd love it.
[45:45.24]Legend of the sport.
[45:46.57]Legend of the sport.
[45:47.51]That would be wicked.
[45:49.09]That's the best line.
[45:50.15]Can we also... I think he's doing it.
[45:52.09]Can we whitelist Rick Flame's Steam ID personal request?
[45:55.46]Can we not boot him from the pub?
[45:57.24]Do we have enough funds to fly him here right now?
[46:00.46]Get him here by tomorrow.
[46:01.55]Can we redo the MGE tournament?
[46:03.53]We got a seat for you, my man.
[46:04.83]He's doing it.
[46:05.43]Oh, maybe not.
[46:06.23]He's probably getting a bunch of Steam messages.
[46:08.90]I'd say game chat's blowing up right now.
[46:10.76]Question mark from Rick Flame.
[46:12.34]Yeah, in the chat.
[46:13.69]He's like, are they talking about me?
[46:16.01]Legend of the Spork.
[46:16.87]Do it, Rick.
[46:17.79]They're all going for it.
[46:19.62]Raze and Geal and everyone, change your name to... Not Spork.
[46:24.15]Come on, guys.
[46:24.73]Spork, Legend of the Spork.
[46:26.19]Am I a meme now?
[46:27.09]Thank you, Nate.
[46:27.79]He's made it.
[46:28.89]At least he knows.
[46:30.55]Yep.
[46:31.33]I hope he does.
[46:32.83]Uh, just say like, uh, it's the stream wants, I don't know, say it in a nice, try to say it in a way that'll encourage him to actually do it.
[46:41.52]Ten bucks from Haunted Indigo, who says, I wish I could donate more, but this is all I can do right now.
[46:47.37]I hope this helps in some way or another.
[46:49.10]We have the legend of the no trade holds.
[46:51.80]Now, who would that be, I wonder?
[46:53.44]What an interesting name that is.
[46:58.33]So Nate, how's it going here?
[46:59.33]Is this a stalemate situation or talk us through this?
[47:02.57]I'm AFK right now because I need to change my name.
[47:05.83]Here it comes.
[47:06.36]It's coming.
[47:07.00]You can't handle the Rick Flame thing, can you?
[47:09.60]It's just like a perfect amount of syllables, you know?
[47:12.84]It has a great ring to it.
[47:14.95]It has a beautiful name to it.
[47:16.93]He can do anything.
[47:18.71]And just have that name.
[47:20.31]Rick Flame.
[47:22.40]He could be a baseball pitcher.
[47:25.00]Rick Flame.
[47:25.38]He's got like a 2.4 ERA.
[47:27.16]Stuntman.
[47:27.84]He could be a surgeon.
[47:28.85]Like Rick Fl- Nate has changed his name to Rick Flame.
[47:35.22]I'm Rick Flame.
[47:36.06]That's Nathan.
[47:36.56]Now we have multiple Rick Flames.
[47:37.82]He has assumed the alias.
[47:40.89]You know how they have those commercials where everyone says, like, I am, and they all say, like, you know, like,
[47:46.01]They pick some celebrity or something.
[47:47.76]Yeah, like, I'm Spartacus, whatever.
[47:48.94]But it's like, you know, it's like, I'm Michael Jordan.
[47:50.68]And someone else is like, I am Michael Jordan.
[47:52.32]And then they go to the end and they got Michael Jordan.
[47:54.49]I think we can do that with Rick Flame.
[47:56.73]Yeah.
[47:57.37]I'm Rick Flame.
[47:58.19]Can we get Rick Flame in the Discord?
[47:59.79]No, I'm Rick Flame.
[48:02.32]He's going to be like, what's wrong with you guys?
[48:04.42]Rick's just crying this whole time.
[48:08.69]Let's get a cutaway to Rick's camera.
[48:11.07]Just a single tear falls.
[48:13.68]Rick.
[48:14.80]I just wanted to play.
[48:17.25]Don't need to get us to stop talking about Rick's playing.
[48:21.24]Good luck.
[48:21.90]There he is, the man, the myth.
[48:25.08]Spamming that angle.
[48:28.44]We're losing our markets.
[48:31.27]If the stream shuts down, that's because Dashner fell on the computer.
[48:34.85]We are losing our minds here in Chicago.
[48:37.77]Dinner24 donates $50.
[48:39.47]It says, donating again because all of you guys put on such an enjoyable show.
[48:44.14]I have to burp, but I'm laughing so hard and it really hurts.
[48:48.46]Donating again because all you guys put on such an enjoyable show and because that darn tracker is making like a calculated mathematician
[48:54.85]and adding numbers to my name.
[48:57.32]Dinner 24!
[48:59.83]Hey, you can eat 24 hours a day.
[49:01.87]It's a service.
[49:02.59]Isn't there a service that you can eat?
[49:04.17]Now, that might just be dinner.
[49:05.39]The 24 might have been added by the track.
[49:08.74]Oh, God.
[49:09.64]What is it?
[49:10.72]Am I allowed to shout it out?
[49:11.98]Can I say it?
[49:12.68]We don't shout here.
[49:14.26]I'm shouting right now.
[49:15.42]You're too late.
[49:17.98]What are you talking about?
[49:19.43]Finish the joke.
[49:20.23]I'm on the edge of my seat.
[49:22.45]Eat 24.
[49:22.99]Don't they deliver food?
[49:24.49]I'm edging my seat here.
[49:25.85]Nobody gets these jokes.
[49:27.01]They're so good.
[49:28.10]Jerma, I like it.
[49:28.92]Can someone burp me?
[49:31.48]Do you know what?
[49:32.12]Admirable got burped at a recent LAN in England.
[49:36.69]Five for Life burped Admirable like a little baby, didn't she?
[49:40.30]Didn't she, James?
[49:41.72]I'm like half being serious.
[49:42.48]You might not remember that.
[49:43.44]He was drinking grown-up Soty.
[49:46.50]Can I burp him?
[49:48.19]Can I burp him?
[49:49.67]Drinking adult.
[49:50.65]He had his adult ice.
[49:52.13]Grown-up Soty.
[49:53.13]He's got his grown-up ice.
[49:57.90]Guys, this is a charity event, as you can tell.
[50:02.14]And we love... Boy, let's keep this going.
[50:07.26]Shout out to Jeff Infusino and the whole staff of Children's Oncology Services.
[50:12.17]My face is tingling.
[50:17.60]Did you even eat pizza?
[50:20.99]I thought you didn't even eat pizza.
[50:23.97]We did foul things.
[50:25.89]Guys, can we get on the Rick cam, please?
[50:28.60]Can we get a Rick cam?
[50:34.15]I understand that this segment was supposed to be mostly about Nathan Vetterlein, but we found a new idol.
[50:40.94]Rick.
[50:41.60]Turn the donation award into getting Rick Flame to appear.
[50:47.03]Nathan, we don't need you anymore, Nathan.
[50:49.33]Goodbye.
[50:50.81]Standing right next to him.
[50:53.36]I need to take a quick drink.
[50:55.20]Look at this guy.
[50:56.54]He's just ducking.
[50:57.12]He's crouching in the corner.
[50:59.04]He can't handle the fame.
[51:00.53]Rick Flame basking.
[51:01.97]He doesn't know how to handle his newfound life.
[51:04.47]You know you laugh so much and you get the pins and needles in your face.
[51:08.06]You blow chunks.
[51:09.60]Nice.
[51:11.67]I swear, Dashner just losing it just got me, man.
[51:18.14]We are losing our minds.
[51:19.68]Our headphones are sound canceling, and when you can hear someone over it, Dashner's headbutting his keyboard.
[51:29.69]Wow, is that a good sign or a bad one?
[51:31.46]Dropped a face smash.
[51:33.66]$30 from Anonymous who says, I can't wait for my friend Rise to beat John D and jump Tom Brady tomorrow.
[51:41.61]Tom Brady's gonna be here tomorrow?
[51:47.01]Can we delete that donation, please?
[51:52.50]Tom Brady's showing up tomorrow.
[51:54.14]He's gonna throw a couple of footballs.
[51:55.54]Oh, Rick just killed himself.
[51:57.27]Rick Flame versus Tom Brady.
[52:00.99]I'm calling it now.
[52:01.69]Guys, all jokes aside, Rick Flame on a tear here.
[52:04.98]He's gonna take down two sentry guns.
[52:07.04]Oh, darn it.
[52:08.64]He stormed that sentry nest with his Huntsman bow and arrow.
[52:12.53]We got water coming.
[52:14.15]How about that?
[52:14.57]Thank you, William.
[52:15.89]Oh, he's throwing it on the skateboarder.
[52:17.93]You know, I'll take it.
[52:19.92]I'm going to slam it.
[52:21.38]Are you ready for a slam?
[52:22.38]Here we go.
[52:23.08]Slam down.
[52:23.96]How do you drink a water bottle in under one second?
[52:26.69]You think you can do it in one second?
[52:27.87]$10,000 and I'll do it.
[52:29.51]Okay, he said he can do it in one second.
[52:31.95]Now you've got that iPad there.

[53:32.78]Well, guys, bottoms up.
[53:35.46]Oh, it hurts a little.
[53:37.21]Peanut butter soda.
[53:38.27]Well, here you go.
[53:41.21]Throw on your headset there, Curtis.
[53:44.77]That might have reached the clock over there.
[53:48.68]Is there like a little bit of drip on that clock?
[53:51.80]Free nasal drip.
[53:54.46]So meanwhile, we are pubbing here.
[53:56.57]We are collecting money.
[53:58.45]Can you believe this is a charity event that's been going on for two days?
[54:01.59]Alright, the event.
[54:02.56]$100.
[54:05.34]Are you hydrated?
[54:07.20]You know what?
[54:08.43]No.
[54:08.79]I feel pretty good right now.
[54:09.93]That was a good hydration.
[54:11.85]$100 for him.
[54:12.69]Am I saying this name right?
[54:13.52]Rhymes?
[54:13.98]Rhymes?
[54:15.12]Thanks, Tag, for wrenching my attention away to watch Tip of the Hat.
[54:18.98]Now, guys, look at this who's pushing the cart.
[54:21.33]You're right next to him, Nate.
[54:22.57]It's Rick Flame.
[54:24.61]Where?
[54:25.38]Rick, right behind you.
[54:26.90]The Rick Flame.
[54:29.26]Oh, boy.
[54:29.80]I can't find him.
[54:30.69]Oh, my God.
[54:31.01]He's got Stabby here.
[54:32.03]He's going to try to get Stabby with the...
[54:34.37]Alright, Rick's still in the mix here.
[54:35.91]This is really an age-old matchup, Rick Flame versus Stabby Stabby.
[54:39.34]You know, remember UGC season one?
[54:41.68]It was Rick's team versus Stabby's team.
[54:44.93]And one that will go down sort of... And that also even goes back to the PGL days when Rick Flame stormed the nest.
[54:53.32]Oh, my God.
[54:53.84]You might be able to find that on XTV in the old archives from 2007.
[54:58.04]Remember on ComFT when that Rick Flame video got a million hits?
[55:02.11]And that was a lot at the time.
[55:03.73]Yeah.
[55:03.85]That was the first TF2 video that got a million hits, and that's a little known fact.
[55:08.46]We got HumaHuma.
[55:09.38]We know her.
[55:09.94]Huma doing it.
[55:11.29]HumaX2.
[55:11.67]$10 from Squiddy, who says, I hope those kids in the camps have a wonderful time.
[55:18.66]So thank you, Squiddy.
[55:19.40]$10.
[55:20.01]I think they will.
[55:20.61]In fact, I know they will.
[55:22.61]Very nice of you.
[55:23.43]Thank you.
[55:25.23]How are we on the incentive?
[55:28.10]Where are we at on the incentive?
[55:29.60]I don't know.
[55:29.96]Let's ask Rick.
[55:30.74]Let's wait until it pops up.
[55:33.50]Where are we on that incentive?
[55:36.27]Do we have Rick's availability yet?
[55:39.15]Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a look at what that incentive is at as soon as it pops up on the screen.
[55:45.66]Because I'm too dumb to get it on the iPad.
[55:48.14]Nope.
[55:48.68]I hope other people are finding this funny.
[55:51.32]I really do.
[55:52.31]If it's just the four of us, I'm okay with that.
[55:56.03]I just laughed and I felt the water like the water just like move the water all over my face.
[56:02.22]Get the Blarf camera.
[56:03.56]It's like a wave pool.
[56:05.32]That water just like went over here.
[56:07.29]That wave tank is moving.
[56:09.49]Just flowing through your intestines.
[56:10.63]I just saw 200 bucks come in there.
[56:12.15]We might get a message on that.
[56:13.56]Really?
[56:14.44]Oh, boy.
[56:15.22]Two Benjamins.
[56:16.30]Two bones.
[56:18.52]Yep.
[56:19.41]So we got Legend of the Sporks here.
[56:20.95]I don't know what that means.
[56:23.39]Rick Flame, Legend of the Sporks.
[56:30.04]Now, Raze, how come you haven't moved over to a Rick Flame-related name?
[56:33.49]You have too much dignity.
[56:35.49]I mean... It's just intimidating to think of.
[56:37.39]It really is, dude.
[56:39.20]See, you're worried that if you change your name and then you don't perform at his level, like, you know, people will get the wrong idea, you know?
[56:45.76]Nate's cracking me up just having that name.
[56:47.83]It's killing me.
[56:49.85]Well punctuated, dude.
[56:51.37]We got a $27 donation from James, or Tao, who says, I have a friend with cancer going through an operation as I type this.
[56:58.68]Can I get a shout-out for...
[57:00.44]Hema Fernandez.
[57:01.84]Yep.
[57:02.32]Hema Fernandez, stay strong.
[57:04.39]We're there with you.
[57:05.39]Keep at it.
[57:06.81]That was $27, by the way.
[57:08.03]Thank you so much.
[57:08.87]Thank you.
[57:09.71]Thank you very much.
[57:10.31]We wish you the best.
[57:11.01]That'll stop you in your tracks, hey?
[57:14.20]Supernova, rickoftheflame.org.
[57:19.28]I'll never forget when I first started playing Team Fortress 2, Rick took me aside and he said, Nathan, it's all about...
[57:31.42]Precision.
[57:32.59]Precision was his tip.
[57:34.83]And the flame as well.
[57:36.05]Sounds like Jonathan Wendell.
[57:39.54]Okay.
[57:39.66]Practice.
[57:41.48]This is a very relevant donation from Milu.
[57:45.99]I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[57:47.37]$200.
[57:48.40]Was planning on starting by matching my last year's donation, but doubled it for Rick Flame.
[57:53.99]Darn it.
[57:54.41]How about that?
[57:55.07]Darn it.
[57:55.45]Darn it.
[57:55.91]Darn it.
[57:56.35]The legend of the sport.
[57:57.39]Dag nab it.
[57:58.20]$200 for Rick Flint.
[57:59.80]There he is.
[58:00.74]His eyes.
[58:01.78]He's always thinking ahead.
[58:03.73]I felt like he just looked at me.
[58:06.05]That's freaky.
[58:07.38]I'm never showering ever again.
[58:09.36]You ever see the scene in the ring where the girl comes through the TV?
[58:12.88]It was kind of like that.
[58:13.68]I feel like I'm watching the Beatles.
[58:15.71]I want him to throw his shirt to me.
[58:17.87]I want to catch his shirt and be like, give me that.
[58:19.89]Jerome, I don't mean to freak you out, but there was a red laser dot on your forehead there for a second.
[58:26.06]What?
[58:27.56]I don't mean to freak you out.
[58:28.66]I don't mean to freak you out, but there was a laser on you.
[58:31.52]Laser.
[58:33.15]So Rick's obviously posting up there in his classic spot.
[58:36.41]We all...
[58:37.83]So we all know Rick knows all the ways of donating, but let's introduce the ways of donating to the viewers.
[58:46.40]Oh, absolutely.
[58:47.24]Well, if you've been a part of the event in the past, you know you've got your option of using a PayPal account to just sort of use money.
[58:54.07]You have monetary donation.
[58:55.73]First year ever, though, as we see here are some headshots going down.
[58:59.39]Rick just trying to pick out that perfect shot.
[59:03.18]You can use TF2 items for the first time ever, including...
[59:07.00]And if you're using those items, for example, something as small as a key, a crepe key, an MVM ticket, or things, like I say, as big as Unusuals or Australian weapons, you can donate them through our donation link, tipofthehats.org slash donate.
[59:23.93]It'll get converted magically to money, which will go directly to...
[59:34.65]to One Step Camp.
[59:36.15]It makes that noise if you donate, so go ahead and donate.
[59:40.74]What's up, Nate?
[59:42.90]Jesus Christ, man.
[59:45.77]Were you trying to say something, Nathan?
[59:47.59]That was me.
[59:48.55]Oh, sorry.
[59:49.43]I'm sorry.
[59:50.21]Some of us have similar voices.
[59:52.46]My mistake.
[59:54.12]What a great segment this has been.
[59:56.12]Yeah, this was unexpected.
[59:59.15]Mmars11 with $100 says, it was either this or buying something special for someone special.
[60:04.84]Now, was this the right choice?
[60:06.51]Hmm, perhaps.
[60:08.04]Much love.
[60:09.26]Ray is love.
[60:10.87]Yeah.
[60:11.25]Thank you for the $100.
[60:11.83]A little Ray shout out there.
[60:13.07]A little Ray shout out there.
[60:14.09]Shout out to Ray's there.
[60:15.27]I don't want to tell you what to do, but it's a virtual item.
[60:18.10]And then $10.
[60:18.72]$10 from Anonymous who says, not much, but I want to help any way I can.
[60:23.38]So thank you, Anonymous, for the $10.
[60:24.83]And you can help in many ways.
[60:26.39]You should count.
[60:26.99]There are many, many ways.
[60:27.87]You don't even have to donate if you don't have money.
[60:29.65]You can just tell other people about this.
[60:31.09]Yes.
[60:31.33]That's a good point.
[60:31.96]Tell them.
[60:32.98]Go outside.
[60:33.84]Ring your neighbor's doorbell.
[60:35.64]Go door to door.
[60:36.46]Yeah.
[60:36.98]Go bring your neighbors to it.
[60:40.97]Hey!
[60:41.65]Let me tell you about tip of the hat.
[60:44.21]Better than nothing.
[60:44.98]Do you have a moment to listen to the story?
[60:48.76]It's a very personal approach, but you also can tweet it on Twitter or even just message your Steam friends that might have played TF2 in the past and
[60:56.14]want to check out a wonderful TF2 event you can put it in your name as well tip of that store a lot of people have done that in the run-up to the event as they always have in years past uh I like it didn't mind not trying to flex so the next time we get an item uh donation on the screen can you make that noise again Mike sure I sure will okay
[61:16.67]That's just the sound of the digital, the bits moving around.
[61:20.46]We have to back up and understand that electrons are moving.
[61:23.60]That's what happens when the two computers talk to each other.
[61:26.99]It's like the dial-up noise.
[61:29.75]It happens when the money printer talks to the computer.
[61:33.72]Whoa, callback.
[61:35.10]Oh, yeah, call back to the money printer.
[61:37.28]20 minutes ago.
[61:38.48]Now, guys, I've lost track of who the real Rick Flame is.
[61:40.79]Do we have the Steam IDs?
[61:41.87]Can we get the real Rick cam?
[61:43.83]He has a genuine anger.
[61:45.93]I know that.
[61:46.45]A green one.
[61:47.20]At real Rick Flame.
[61:48.66]Bet you that's been taken on Twitter already.
[61:50.88]Real Rick Flame.
[61:53.78]Flick Ream.
[61:54.63]That's not him.
[61:56.03]Anonymous donated $30, and they say Q. Get some Qs in the chat, boys.
[62:01.37]Can we get some Qs in the chat, please?
[62:03.06]Ultimate.
[62:03.68]Ultimate.
[62:04.38]How many did they ult?
[62:05.40]Ulti.
[62:07.88]Q is a pretty good letter.
[62:09.42]Play of the game.
[62:12.59]There it was.
[62:13.15]He feigned death.
[62:15.63]That's it.
[62:16.84]Yeah.
[62:18.36]Boy.
[62:19.42]Someone should make that a YouTube video.
[62:22.54]That hasn't been done.
[62:27.06]Pride, with a $20 donation, just says, read this.
[62:31.30]Thank you, Pride.
[62:32.11]Dude, you got tricked.
[62:33.63]It worked on you.
[62:34.81]Did he trick me?
[62:35.69]Stupid.
[62:36.17]He tricked me?
[62:37.58]You stupid.
[62:38.58]Oh, you missed it.
[62:39.72]What happened?
[62:40.12]Was it Pepsi Man?
[62:41.70]Dang it.
[62:42.44]Pepsi Man.
[62:43.55]Pepsi Man.
[62:45.89]Oh.
[62:47.65]Next time.
[62:48.12]Okay, sorry.
[62:49.64]Next time.
[62:50.54]Pepsi man.
[62:52.21]We just got a bunch of item donations and we missed them all.
[62:54.83]Thank you guys so much.
[62:55.83]Thank you everybody for the item donations.
[62:57.42]The noise printer didn't work.
[62:58.98]Yeah, that's money there.
[62:59.86]Jesus Hoovy with one dollar.
[63:02.85]Thank you, Jesus.
[63:05.41]This dollar here.
[63:07.45]Poot dollar here.
[63:09.30]Jesus really cracked Wyatt's funny bone.
[63:14.20]Boy, that hit the spot.
[63:20.01]Check, please.
[63:22.69]Viper with $10 says, first time donating.
[63:24.73]Glad to do anything I can.
[63:25.85]Hashtag photo kids.
[63:27.43]Thank you, Viper.
[63:28.43]This is for kids, isn't it?
[63:30.06]Yes, it is.
[63:30.80]Yeah, I remember that.
[63:32.62]For them.
[63:34.38]How many kids do you have now?
[63:36.19]How many kids do I have?
[63:37.55]Yeah, yeah.
[63:38.13]What's it up to?
[63:41.06]Does a dog count?
[63:42.92]Because that would be fun.
[63:43.95]If you gave birth to it, yeah.
[63:47.91]I gave birth to my dog.
[63:50.67]That's how it works.
[63:51.33]Well, we don't need to put you on the spot with an answer.
[63:53.55]We can start talking about something else.
[63:56.34]We can start talking about something else if you don't want to reveal that lie.
[63:59.48]I've got five kids.
[64:00.27]John, Jason, Jerry, Jonathan.
[64:03.15]Jingle.
[64:04.13]Jeremiah.
[64:05.37]They're all J's.
[64:06.32]Jeremy 2, Jeremy 3, Jeremy 4, Jeremy 5.
[64:09.96]Didn't even go with Junior.
[64:11.36]Didn't even go with Junior.
[64:12.20]That's so 1992.
[64:14.97]There's no law against that.
[64:16.77]You can just name your kids numbers.
[64:19.19]You can name your kids just about anything, actually.
[64:21.42]Jeremy Junior.
[64:22.68]One cool thing is name your kids 1, 3, and 4 and let them loose in the high school.
[64:28.06]And everyone will be looking for 2.
[64:29.65]Let them loose?
[64:32.59]Go to school, kids.
[64:35.17]That was our senior prank that we did.
[64:37.87]You all changed your names?
[64:40.87]Seriously, folks.
[64:42.86]I come from a weird neighborhood.
[64:45.38]A lot of bad apples.
[64:48.07]So your senior prank was you released children into a high school.
[64:51.57]Yep.
[64:52.71]How about that?
[64:53.17]Joke's on you.
[64:54.01]Kooky.
[64:55.35]There's a bunch of kids.
[64:56.44]Kooky.
[64:57.96]And they all attended the school anyways.
[64:59.82]Yeah.
[65:00.44]I wasn't thinking about that one before I started talking.
[65:07.13]Believe it or not, that joke wasn't planned.
[65:09.47]Hasn't been crafting that one for hours.
[65:11.15]We're thinking that one through.
[65:12.09]The backstory, full of holes.
[65:15.69]Sorry, you've got plenty of plot armor.
[65:17.74]You're good.
[65:19.56]$30 from Anonymous that just says, hey, hey, hey, $30 Anonymous.
[65:23.84]Thank you very much.
[65:24.40]That's a good message.
[65:26.48]We've got hey, Q.
[65:28.90]Yeah.
[65:29.84]Thank you.
[65:30.31]Boy, what else are we going to see here tonight?
[65:32.07]What else can you see?
[65:33.39]I'm getting whiplash from these donation comments.
[65:35.50]How many words and letters left?
[65:37.46]That's almost all of them.
[65:38.44]$10 from Quanton, who says, I'm confused.
[65:41.81]Did this go through?
[65:42.99]Yes.
[65:43.63]It did.
[65:44.09]Thank you for your $10.
[65:46.54]It did.
[65:48.26]Another $10 from Miss Chandler.
[65:51.58]Miss Chandelier?
[65:52.64]Chandler Bong?
[65:53.45]Chandler Bong.
[65:54.41]That's a Friends reference.
[65:55.55]Okay.
[65:55.89]You should know that.
[65:56.63]You're old like me.
[65:57.61]Yeah, you're old enough.
[65:58.33]I never watched Friends.
[65:59.63]Yeah, Nate knows.
[66:00.23]Nate's on board, right?
[66:01.05]I know.
[66:01.44]I wasn't a Friends watcher.
[66:03.00]No one was, but it doesn't mean that you don't know it.
[66:05.48]That's true.
[66:05.98]That's kind of true.
[66:06.84]Nobody was a Friends watcher, but everyone did see it.
[66:09.65]Excuse me.
[66:11.13]Alright.
[66:11.45]Do it.
[66:13.25]They just say boop with a smiley face.
[66:15.47]Boy.
[66:15.73]Oh, yeah.
[66:16.61]Thank you.
[66:17.32]Boop.
[66:17.76]Boop.
[66:18.89]Boop.
[66:19.81]Boop.
[66:19.93]Rick Flame.
[66:20.45]Boop.
[66:21.49]Is the genuine Rick Flame here?
[66:24.19]Yeah, if anyone's tuning in just to the stream now, we've got to tell you that's not actually Rick Flame.
[66:29.50]I think that's the actual one.
[66:31.26]There he is.
[66:32.25]Real legend.
[66:32.79]So real legend is him.
[66:34.19]Yep.
[66:34.69]Nathan Vetterlein, the scout's voice actor, of course, is the one wearing the Rick Flame Legend of the Sport name.
[66:42.00]Right.
[66:42.58]Now, come on, Nate.
[66:43.36]We like you good enough.
[66:44.32]You don't have to pretend to be Rick.
[66:47.25]Let's see, I don't, I don't... Sometimes we all need something to aspire to, and for me, it's Rick.
[66:56.38]We're at 13k, we just got there.
[66:58.19]Do you think we can get to 15k before the, uh, 115k before the half stream ends?
[67:03.73]Definitely.
[67:04.67]Guys, if we can get to 115k tonight, we're gonna shave Kurt's beard and glue it to Admirable's head.
[67:09.98]That's what we're going to do.
[67:11.54]That's true.
[67:13.12]That's an absolute fact.
[67:14.46]We're actually doing that.
[67:16.15]Yep.
[67:17.23]Jesus Hoovy with $69 says, Jesus Hoovy versus Rick Flame in Jerma Rumble 5.
[67:22.76]Now, that's a strange number he used.
[67:26.24]That is a strange number.
[67:27.51]Yeah.
[67:28.01]But it's funny.
[67:29.11]Thanks.
[67:29.37]Thank you for that number.
[67:30.13]Jerma Rumble was great, by the way.
[67:31.55]I don't know if we've mentioned it because I was having a nap, but that was a cool little video, Jerma.
[67:35.94]It was a fun video.
[67:37.44]A little video.
[67:38.82]It was a fun one to make.
[67:39.79]I'm glad you like it.
[67:41.63]It was definitely something I've always wanted to do, at least for the last couple of years.
[67:46.91]It's fun to do.
[67:48.01]Cool, man.
[67:49.18]Do you know what video I liked when we were talking about this?
[67:50.71]The one where you had an Ethernet phone port on the back of your head.
[67:53.37]Oh, back notes?
[67:54.87]Yeah.
[67:54.99]Yeah, they shrunk me.
[67:55.69]I even said that to him earlier, too.
[67:57.68]They shrunk me.
[67:58.84]Me and Wyatt think alike.
[68:00.74]We like the same kind of Ethernet-related humor.
[68:06.07]Boy, in fact, that's how we met.
[68:07.29]Ethernet-related humor.
[68:08.31]Yeah, at the Ethernet convention.
[68:12.37]What booth were you guys at?
[68:14.91]Tactician42 with $50 says, Dear Derm is still waiting on that Dr. Pepper.
[68:26.07]Lucky for you, I wanted to donate anyway.
[68:27.81]How about talking about that pick-your-own-adventure book you're making?
[68:31.11]Oh, he brought up the book.
[68:33.07]What do I do?
[68:34.42]Play me out.
[68:35.96]We'll play da-da-da-da-da-da.
[68:38.46]We'll pause the stream for a moment.
[68:40.66]The real question is who's going to get that Dr. Pepper?
[68:43.51]That Dr. Pepper is sitting on that Walgreens show ready to get purchased.
[68:46.90]We can get lost in Chicago.
[68:48.94]Three nights in a row.
[68:49.84]Maybe they got a shipment.
[68:50.97]Did you guys just get a shipment?
[68:53.15]They got a huge shipment of Dr. Pepper.
[68:55.14]Dude, Walgreens is having trucks come in.
[68:57.24]Minute after minute with shipments.
[69:00.47]Really something else.
[69:01.63]$30 from ItsWeenie$30 says, Every year, Tip of the Hats makes me very happy for bringing the community together.
[69:07.18]Doing good and great work, guys.
[69:09.12]Keep it up.
[69:10.31]Good and great.
[69:11.31]Very great.
[69:11.71]Thank you, ItsWeenie$30.
[69:13.33]Thank you.
[69:13.85]We'll try.
[69:14.86]We'll try.
[69:15.42]You guys see there's someone named FlickRame.
[69:18.62]Dude!
[69:19.92]They transposed the letters!
[69:22.03]It's amazing!
[69:23.77]Oh, ba-bow.
[69:24.71]Yahtzee.
[69:26.48]How did they do that?
[69:27.10]Did anybody have Yahtzee?
[69:28.40]How did they do that?
[69:29.42]Oh, I so badly want to roll Yahtzee right now and just get all you guys, you know what I mean?
[69:32.89]How did they do that?
[69:33.45]I have Yahtzee.
[69:34.03]I've played Yahtzee.
[69:34.77]I like Yahtzee.
[69:36.39]You're a Yahtzee head?
[69:38.72]How fast could you get to Chicago?
[69:41.97]Who said that?
[69:44.35]Virtual games.
[69:45.25]How fast could you get on that plane to get to Chicago?
[69:51.82]Blackbird not found.
[69:52.80]$1.70 items.
[69:58.77]Beautiful.
[70:00.91]So we're, yeah.
[70:02.28]How did Valve manage to make all these pixels worth so much money, Mike?
[70:05.92]Boy, glad you asked.
[70:09.33]I'm very glad you asked.
[70:10.37]Let's figure this out.
[70:12.46]Now, Nate, how much do you know about pixels?
[70:16.47]Define pixel.
[70:17.84]So nothing.
[70:19.70]It's a movie with Adam Sandler.
[70:23.64]Is that what it was called?
[70:24.95]Adam Sandler made that movie.
[70:26.07]That one where Pac-Man comes from space or something?
[70:29.99]That was a terrible depiction of Pac-Man, by the way.
[70:32.86]Not realistic at all.
[70:35.06]Not realistic at all.
[70:36.66]Come on.
[70:37.10]The real Pac-Man would not be able to be intelligent enough to get up there and be in the sky.
[70:41.65]And Pac-Man, everyone knows Pac-Man is not from space.
[70:45.03]No.
[70:45.79]He's actually from Europe.
[70:47.54]He's from like a little hut in the woods.
[70:49.08]Europe.
[70:49.68]We just got a warning.
[70:50.66]Somebody just is busting into our set here.
[70:53.55]Now what's that?
[70:54.35]I don't recognize him.
[70:55.33]So we were supposed to have a step and repeat with our logo on it.
[71:01.46]And that was supposed to show up today.
[71:02.76]But instead what we got...
[71:04.53]is this.
[71:08.34]Guys, wait till you see this joke.
[71:10.30]It's better the second time.
[71:12.09]CVS.
[71:12.61]So thanks to CVS, I guess, for sending us their banner.
[71:16.12]And I guess CVS has our step and repeat.
[71:20.29]So, if you work at CVS and you have a tip of the hat, step and repeat, please send it to us.
[71:26.06]That is a classic mix-up right there.
[71:28.97]You can get Dr. Pepper there, I bet.
[71:30.53]You can probably get some Dr. P there.
[71:31.75]Go get your flu shot.
[71:32.85]That's my segment, everyone.
[71:33.96]Six dollars for your flu shot.
[71:35.52]Now, not a lot of people know CVS Pharmacy's mission.
[71:38.36]Now we do know.
[71:40.97]CVS Pharmacy.
[71:42.47]That's so funny.
[71:44.43]Thanks to our sponsor, CVS.
[71:46.04]They've done nothing for this.
[71:47.16]You should just keep it in here.
[71:48.18]Just keep it up over here.
[71:49.58]Thanks to CVS for putting us up in this beautiful hotel.
[71:52.91]It's so loud.
[71:54.09]Not Children's Oncology Services, ain't certainly.
[71:57.23]Well, that's a mix-up.
[71:58.53]How about that?
[71:59.69]We got the wrong step and repeat.
[72:02.14]Norm G. with $50 says, Didn't know Tip of the Hats was happening, but I'm glad I caught the stream.
[72:07.24]I'm happy to pitch it.
[72:08.26]Thank you, Norm.
[72:09.65]Thank you.
[72:10.45]Mark your calendar next time.
[72:12.25]Good timing there.
[72:13.17]You still got another day to watch.
[72:15.01]Full day tomorrow.
[72:16.35]Can you believe that?
[72:17.24]Three days.
[72:18.36]And guys, let's remind you, we're up over $6,000 now on the Scout Voice Actor Pub.
[72:24.38]So Nate's going to be with us tomorrow.
[72:25.59]Hopefully, as long as we hit 10K, we're going to have the Scout.
[72:29.43]We're getting a bit on the Guitar Hero Pyro, too.
[72:31.59]You see that?
[72:32.29]Pyro Hero.
[72:33.39]That's a Pyro Hero I've heard.
[72:34.91]When I heard it described to me, I imagined it a certain way.
[72:38.32]And then when I heard about how it works, apparently the strumming part
[72:42.20]is what you use to burn which I got more on board with it for some reason like rocking I don't know I think it'll be cool I'm into it check it out give us money how about that give us money hey retrospect with ten dollars okay it says here's another ten dollars oh you guys are awesome and tell Nate to punch a spy in the face for me okay thanks for after I got you fam
[73:04.75]Well, let's see it.
[73:05.47]I think he's been doing it the whole time.
[73:07.01]Has he been punching spies in the face?
[73:08.77]I think so.
[73:09.52]I mean, I've been punching at them.
[73:12.38]In the general direction of spies.
[73:13.62]The general affinity.
[73:14.76]But I see you with those bread fists.
[73:16.25]I mean, it seems like you really want it.
[73:18.75]It's more for style.
[73:19.85]Yeah.
[73:20.67]I do like it.
[73:21.37]I like the animation.
[73:22.32]I like how they do their own thing, you know?
[73:24.32]They're kind of like looking at one another, moving their mouth.
[73:29.09]They're sentient, those gloves.
[73:31.46]Look at them there.
[73:33.22]Those things are awesome.
[73:34.44]I do like them.
[73:35.71]Yeah.
[73:36.97]Actually, Retro, who just donated, gave me these.
[73:40.21]Oh, nice.
[73:40.53]Really?
[73:41.39]Cool.
[73:41.51]How about that?
[73:42.08]Talk about a small fucking room.
[73:43.44]Oh, F-bomb.
[73:44.42]Sorry.
[73:45.44]It's okay.
[73:45.94]I didn't hear what you said.
[73:46.86]The stream's going down.
[73:47.96]We'll see you later.
[73:48.74]See you tomorrow, guys.
[73:50.13]Nathan just farmed on stream.
[73:51.67]That was the last tip of the hats ever.
[73:55.25]Five bucks from the Spy Lobster who says, donated earlier and want to make sure it went through.
[73:59.70]So glad to see Jerma playing again.
[74:01.54]Love you guys and the great cause.
[74:02.94]Also, technically, Jerma's not playing right now.
[74:05.73]Yeah, you're not playing at all.
[74:07.07]I told you I have telekinetic telekinesis.
[74:08.71]Take that donation back.
[74:11.10]I was just playing.
[74:13.48]Also, I want to see Q equals skill in chat.
[74:17.82]Oh, you don't have to do that.
[74:18.89]I mean, you can if you will.
[74:19.99]You don't have to do that.
[74:21.53]You can if you care.
[74:23.29]Maybe post OP OP instead.
[74:25.19]Yeah, OP OP is pretty strong.
[74:26.80]Let's get some Franker Zs.
[74:28.94]What about PogChamp?
[74:31.44]Let's get some MV game Jcan styles.
[74:33.84]$100.
[74:34.51]Oh, Jcan style, dude.
[74:36.07]Yes.
[74:36.47]Big brother.

[74:41.94]You can do it.
[74:44.24]I just went, he, he, he, he, he.
[74:46.87]I didn't even mean to.
[74:47.59]That was actually a laugh.
[74:49.83]$100 from Anonymous who says, Hey, here's my donation.
[74:53.39]Thank you to everyone at the Tip of the Hats team for putting on this amazing event.
[74:56.83]It's amazing to see a whole community gathered for such a great cause.
[75:00.14]Shout out to all the behind-the-scenes organizers.
[75:02.38]I know how much work is required for an event like this.
[75:05.28]P.S.
[75:06.00]Hope to see Jerma vs. Snur action this weekend.
[75:09.15]We want to see this happen.
[75:10.89]Well, I'll do it in real life.
[75:13.39]I'll just go like, I'll just like, you know, I'll give him one of those...
[75:16.36]Hopefully that's not that loud.
[75:18.04]That doesn't transmit through the mic very well.
[75:21.78]You know, it kind of emphasizes what you're going to do.
[75:25.31]I won't do the noise this time, but you can put it in.
[75:26.99]Don't do the noise.
[75:28.29]We'll tell you, we're winding down on the pump here, but a good time to remind people, I mean, we're kind of in prime time hours here, especially maybe for people out west.
[75:37.57]All the kind of stuff you can do.
[75:39.43]We still got shirts.
[75:40.73]The shirts aren't going anywhere.
[75:42.21]And I think, I mean, they're...
[75:44.22]I like them better not nothing against last year's but I like the new yeah uh jazz butts beautiful design she's very uh talented in what she does yeah I made the graphics so that's uh teespring.com 2016 I believe I'm very curious to how many we've sold yes you are correct with the url earl I call it yeah uh as well uh we had a second batch of pins are those all gone
[76:09.31]We'll check into that.
[76:11.75]Of course, you guys have been donating cash all the way through.
[76:14.52]You can see the little cash icon, Pobo.
[76:16.78]Yeah, there have been a lot of last-minute donations here tonight.
[76:20.81]We might actually extend the pub a bit just because you guys are being so generous.
[76:25.15]Yeah, that would be good.
[76:26.12]How about that?
[76:27.44]But of course, yeah, you know, we have the cash donations, and then on top of that, item donations.
[76:33.49]I went in, it's very easy.
[76:34.95]If I can do it, anyone can do it.
[76:38.48]I can do it.
[76:40.10]I have to ride a three-wheeled bike because I can't do the two-wheel.
[76:43.35]Can you drift?
[76:46.95]Well, what do you mean?
[76:48.53]Like in Mario Kart, just like, yeah.
[76:51.52]Then you wiggle and get the speed boost.
[76:53.34]I forgot about the speed boost.
[76:55.42]What a trick.
[76:56.72]What I was trying to say before I was interrupted is you can donate in-game TF2 items.
[77:02.89]I donated some keys.
[77:05.19]I watched Sideshow.
[77:06.92]That's Geo that I pointed to, but he looks like Sideshow.
[77:09.68]They both wear shirts.
[77:11.02]Uh, you can donate Australian weapons.
[77:13.20]I saw he had a, uh... Oh!
[77:15.61]Wow, boy.
[77:16.61]Shroud Lord again.
[77:19.19]Golly.
[77:19.65]Hi.
[77:19.79]Hi.
[77:20.07]Shroud Lord.
[77:20.83]500.
[77:20.99]500 bucks.
[77:21.51]We might get to that message in a sec.
[77:22.85]But anyway, if your item in TF2 is gold, you can probably donate it, including all Australians, keys, MBM tickets, Unusuals can be donated.
[77:32.98]Oh, my.
[77:33.81]Aaron.
[77:34.27]Aaron, please.
[77:35.83]Aaron getting a big shot there.
[77:37.13]Unusuals can be donated the first time ever in four years.
[77:40.52]They will get converted to their value in money and go straight to One Step Camp, which is friggin' cool.
[77:46.59]Geal9, thank you for that.
[77:48.51]Yeah, he worked on it all this morning and passed out immediately after.
[77:53.62]Yep.
[77:54.04]He thought the floor was shaking.
[77:55.36]We mentioned that already.
[77:57.39]But, uh, Unusuals, they'll get converted to their value in money and go to the charity, which I think is freaking sweet.
[78:03.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:04.37]They're supposed to go to charity?
[78:05.85]Geel, don't do this to me.
[78:07.98]By the way, that $500 donation from Shrublord says...
[78:11.42]I'm going to miss Jump tomorrow, so I'm donating now.
[78:14.30]Can we get a spam of fish, fish, fish when my boy Fishy runs?
[78:18.96]Oh, and expand pub.
[78:21.05]So thank you very much, Shrublord.
[78:22.57]I've heard about the Fishy runs before.
[78:24.59]Yeah, we should probably get 128 slots into this pub.
[78:27.73]That's how many people I want to see playing Payload Frontier.
[78:30.22]Yep.
[78:30.72]So we're just under 115,000 now.
[78:33.18]We are extending the pub by about 15 minutes.
[78:36.52]What do you think about that, Nate?
[78:38.52]I think I'm going to play Pyro.

[79:07.96]Boy.
[79:08.22]I hate to see it happen.
[79:09.30]Pardon the pun on that one.
[79:12.30]I like this $10 donation from Bloodsire.
[79:14.47]Eight foot CVS banner.
[79:16.27]Almost as long as CVS receipts.

[79:33.38]Oh, going down.
[79:34.53]Oh, that's not Rick Flame.
[79:36.07]No.
[79:36.21]That's not Rick Flame.
[79:37.45]Doing some front burning there.
[79:40.08]Back burning, front burning.
[79:41.84]Let's call the whole thing off.
[79:43.43]I learned that from Rick.
[79:44.33]He taught me that one.
[79:45.15]Here he is.
[79:45.73]Rick's here with the... There he is.
[79:47.27]Let's see his plan.
[79:48.20]He's wearing his, uh... That right... Oh!
[79:50.90]Okay, well... Spies can kill anyone.
[79:53.25]You're not killed by one Rick flame.
[79:56.29]Legend of the Jorts.
[79:57.54]Now, what's that?
[79:58.12]I believe that's a sort of a portmanteau for Jean shorts.
[80:02.71]Yes.
[80:04.71]You like Jean shorts?
[80:05.31]Yeah, I think you're right.
[80:06.37]Jorts.
[80:07.34]Well, that's what my pants turned into, remember?
[80:09.28]They just fell apart.
[80:10.46]How about that?
[80:10.92]Now, there was a cool joke.
[80:12.11]We had $100 come in from anonymous.
[80:15.73]You're allowed to make jokes, and so are other people.
[80:18.29]Everyone's allowed to make jokes.
[80:19.49]We're all jokesters.
[80:20.22]I'll tell you when you're older.
[80:21.72]But we did have a $100 donation come in from anonymous.
[80:23.90]It says, hey, guys, donating in honor of an older sister.
[80:26.64]I lost cancer.
[80:27.54]Keep up the good work.
[80:28.95]Thank you, anonymous, for your $100 donation.
[80:31.25]Much appreciated.
[80:32.93]Thank you very much.
[80:34.41]Rick.
[80:35.83]This one is a $20 donation from Kilo Ton.
[80:40.26]Oh, air shot by Bobby Basketball.
[80:43.48]There's a callback.
[80:44.68]Did that happen?
[80:45.38]That's an old, old highlight.
[80:47.56]There's a video of me screaming.
[80:49.47]Bobby Basketball.
[80:51.29]1999.
[80:51.45]There's a video of me screaming.
[80:53.37]That's it.
[80:53.81]That's the whole video.
[80:54.73]It's the internet's mentor.
[80:56.15]Rick Flame has tweeted.
[80:57.75]Now, I doubt severely that it's the real guy.
[81:01.26]Oh.
[81:01.30]At Rick flamed legend it is the real guy So Rick now with his sniper avatar he's gonna market garden his teammate and
[81:27.22]He's got a murder card and a dead body.

[81:30.48]Come on.
[81:30.98]Come on.
[81:31.36]I need to see him.
[81:32.34]He just got a kill on one of the jumpers in the jump sack bin.
[81:35.97]Now, Jerma, I think you were wanting to get a selfie next to the TV, weren't you, with Rick on the screen?
[81:41.54]Wow.
[81:42.28]Did we see those items?
[81:43.96]Whoa.
[81:44.30]That was inappropriate.
[81:46.20]That was Rick's backpack.
[81:47.43]We're trying to see if we can hook something up with a sponsorship.
[81:52.29]A bird with $10 says, today was good.
[81:55.20]Looking forward to the shenanigans of tomorrow.
[81:57.20]And then in parentheses, he, he, he, he, he.

[82:41.79]Hey, guys, what's up?

[84:00.27]Work is work, but it's cool to see everyone.
[84:02.41]It's nice to get together.
[84:03.73]It's absolutely fantastic for everybody involved.
[84:06.41]That's why this event is so awesome.
[84:08.18]Yep.
[84:09.30]Is it really 11 o'clock?
[84:11.14]P.m.. No way yeah, I feel like it's like 4 in the afternoon 1104 well.
[84:16.89]It was 4 a.m.. Yeah, we've been here all night I can keep I could go all that germans Tuesday
[84:25.11]What's wrong with you?
[84:26.08]It's Tuesday.
[84:27.16]We've been trying to get you out of that seat.
[84:29.26]You won't leave.
[84:30.48]That's impossible.
[84:31.36]Jerm has been dead for 40 years.
[84:36.09]What?
[84:37.54]I don't even understand what that even means.
[84:40.06]Now, Rick, that's short for Richard, I believe.
[84:42.14]Is that correct?
[84:44.20]Wyatt?
[84:46.02]I thought he was talking to me.
[84:46.98]We need to get Rick Flame in this one.
[84:48.26]I'm not a namology.
[84:49.06]Oh, oh, Rick Flame.
[84:49.97]I think we've got him on the line, actually.
[84:51.19]Are you there, Rick?
[84:51.89]Hello?
[84:52.81]Hi.
[84:53.07]No, we don't.
[84:54.79]Who's that?
[84:55.17]You?
[84:55.55]That's what Rick Flame sounds like.
[84:56.69]It's me, Rick Flame.
[84:57.65]I wonder if Rick knows the clocks.
[84:59.58]It's me.
[85:00.44]I like that his voice was, hoi.
[85:04.32]Alright, what's going on?
[85:07.11]Hoi.
[85:07.33]Yeah.
[85:08.14]Rick Fraud.
[85:08.88]Oh, look at this.
[85:09.30]We got a staff.
[85:09.96]Chainsaw.
[85:10.40]Chainsaw.
[85:10.82]Chainsaw.
[85:11.38]Chainsaw.
[85:12.12]He didn't chant it hard enough.
[85:13.48]Now, Nate, other than Rick Flame, are there any other MVPs?
[85:16.69]And other than you, of course, are there any other MVPs in this pub that you want to shout out?
[85:21.04]Legends of the sport, perhaps?
[85:23.10]No, absolutely not.
[85:24.18]Absolutely not.
[85:25.34]We'll get new people in here.
[85:26.26]That would take away from what Rick has accomplished here today.
[85:29.51]Truly, we were actually talking earlier about the TF2 Hall of Fame.
[85:32.93]Of course, he was one of the first members in that.
[85:36.46]The original member, if I recall correctly, in Bellevue, Washington, right next to the airport.
[85:42.21]Yeah, there's actually a signed portrait in Valve on one of the walls of Rick, and it says, stay classy, Valve.
[85:50.49]It says, I'm Rick Flame, and it's a quote.
[85:57.18]I'm Rick Flame!
[85:59.44]Man, I loved when he used to say that.
[86:01.33]Remember his famous line?
[86:05.05]Fishy238 with $30 says, Donating another $30 for the best cause of the year run by the best people in the world.
[86:11.46]Let me get a shrub, shrub, shrub in chat from my fellow moderator at Jump Academy and my boy Shrublord for donating like $1,000 today.
[86:19.93]Yeah.
[86:20.35]And then in brackets.
[86:21.13]He really did.
[86:21.87]He, he, he.
[86:23.15]He, he, he.
[86:23.64]Thank you so much, guys.
[86:24.38]Thank you, Fishy.
[86:25.26]I'm Rick Flame.
[86:27.12]I'm the only one that thinks that one's funny.
[86:30.40]I think I laughed as hard as I possibly could.
[86:34.91]His famous catchphrase.
[86:35.83]There was a lot of goofy goofs.
[86:38.41]I like the idea of Rick Flame sending autographed pictures with the quote, I'm Rick Flame.
[86:44.70]What would his picture be?
[86:46.60]Just the picture of the sniper?
[86:50.50]I can hear that becoming a real business right now as we speak.
[86:55.87]Signed Rickflamephotos.com.
[86:58.86]I'd buy one.
[86:59.92]Yep.
[87:00.48]I'd buy one.
[87:01.92]So here's Rick.
[87:02.56]He's trying to figure out how to do the dance and spawn, but he's Rick.
[87:06.51]He doesn't have time for dancing.
[87:07.91]He's got a market garden and someone.
[87:09.86]He's got to bring himself down to 41 HP and spawn.
[87:13.26]He got head-shooted.
[87:14.08]And he'll still take on the whole other team.
[87:16.71]Oh, boy.
[87:17.01]Even lifted his finger.
[87:18.09]He'll be great.
[87:18.85]You know, it's the same kind of thing that happens to, you know, any of us.
[87:21.77]I mean, Nathan, you probably know this one.
[87:23.74]When people realize Rick Flame is in the pub, they're just aiming and shooting for him directly.
[87:28.94]He's really being ganged up on is what I'm saying.
[87:31.43]The incredible thing that Rick's been able to do here tonight is pretty much in light of that fact.
[87:36.30]Because when you put a target on your back that huge.
[87:40.44]Yeah.
[87:42.21]Yeah.
[87:42.94]No, I hear you.
[87:43.80]I mean, it's like he's like an elite wide receiver.
[87:46.08]You know, he's got three or four guys covering him at all times.
[87:49.94]And he's doing this in triple, quadruple coverage.
[87:53.07]Wow.
[87:54.35]Just a legend.
[87:55.33]Legend of the sport.
[87:56.17]$11.11 from Newton Meters, who says, Both parents are cancer survivors.
[88:02.75]Loving the great work, boys.
[88:04.01]Second year watching and first year donating.
[88:06.54]All the way from Down Under, doing it for the kids.
[88:08.56]Now, that's great.
[88:09.44]Can we pull that tweet up again, by the way?
[88:11.62]I don't understand.
[88:12.72]Rick Flame's tweet reads as follows.
[88:14.68]My ringtone is a train whistle, so I can be constantly reminded that I'm not a conductor.
[88:19.93]In the early 1940s, train conductors were actually regarded as undraftable.
[88:37.84]You couldn't bring them into the military, so they were terrible shots.
[88:41.32]Because trains were such an integral part of the American economy.
[88:43.93]Make sure to tune in tomorrow at 1 Eastern for our train discussion.
[88:47.59]Train roundtable.
[88:50.06]Live here in Chicago.
[88:52.02]We are almost at our donation incentives, I believe, for the voice actor.
[88:58.74]Do you go by Nate or do you not like that?
[89:00.40]Do you prefer Nathan?
[89:02.62]I go by Rick Flame.
[89:04.73]Stupid question.
[89:07.09]Boy, dumb question there.
[89:08.01]You know what they say about stupid questions.
[89:09.75]Are we going to keep this going tomorrow?
[89:13.22]I can hold on to it for quite a long time.
[89:15.22]Who wants to think of a new joke anyway?
[89:17.31]I sincerely hope other people find this funny.
[89:19.99]I am enjoying it, but...
[89:22.01]I mean, every tip of the hats, we've had some big kind of jokes that are the most memorable.
[89:27.64]I mean, Jeremy, you were part of the Pretty Good last year, of course.
[89:30.32]That was a big deal, yeah.
[89:31.63]And the Ideal Hat.
[89:33.05]Classic.
[89:33.37]What is your ideal hat?
[89:34.31]What is your ideal hat out of one of these?
[89:37.55]What happened?
[89:38.50]Did we get breached?
[89:39.76]You thought, like, the mumble got, like, breached.
[89:43.16]There's a sniper on the roof.
[89:44.06]There's, like, some guy in there.
[89:45.97]Yep.
[89:46.07]That was hilarious.
[89:48.03]Now, $30 from Squishy Dude, who says, what you're all doing is great.
[89:52.26]Keep it up.
[89:52.92]Making jokes.
[89:53.48]Thank you, Squishy Dude.
[89:54.79]Being morons.
[89:56.01]Making jokes.
[89:57.95]Doing the jokes.
[89:58.59]Deep breaths.
[89:59.83]What you're all doing.
[90:02.58]Just a group of idiots.
[90:04.50]What are you all doing?
[90:07.30]That's not my question.
[90:08.41]$10 from Varsa, who says, thank you guys for all that you do.
[90:12.12]Toth is a great cause and keeps the community together.
[90:14.52]This is my third year watching.
[90:16.04]Also, shout out my team, Truckaraptor.
[90:20.98]Truckaraptor.
[90:21.48]Yeah, I sponsored her team in open this season.
[90:25.36]Cool.
[90:25.63]Really cool.
[90:26.09]Very, very interesting.
[90:28.77]A bunch of people from my stream became friends over the years, and they're deciding to go into competitive ESEA this season, so it's decided I'd like to sponsor them.
[90:38.02]Cool.
[90:38.60]Nice.
[90:38.88]Best of luck to them.
[90:39.71]Good luck.
[90:40.25]Varsa, also known as Vart for short.
[90:42.59]Yeah, of course.
[90:43.69]We all know that.
[90:45.27]Were you still planning on sponsoring my team?
[90:49.88]Yeah, what's your team name?
[90:52.00]Of course.
[90:52.40]I'll sponsor you.
[90:52.98]Reclaim.
[90:54.34]Come on, it's like Quiplash.
[90:56.04]Everybody just says fish.
[90:58.85]Rick in the flames.
[91:01.77]When we played Quiplash on my stream, everybody was spamming Harambe's.
[91:05.92]That's all we got.
[91:06.52]Boy, that'll never get old.
[91:09.47]I don't think.
[91:11.38]I don't think that will ever.
[91:12.92]Harambe!
[91:14.08]How does a joke just manage to be funny every time?
[91:16.46]Does anybody else think dabbing is hilarious?
[91:18.63]What's up?
[91:20.29]Remember that?
[91:21.85]That was the original me.
[91:23.37]Yeah, the what's up guys will be on tomorrow, so that'll be cool.
[91:26.26]From the Budweiser commercial in 1998.
[91:29.28]Those guys are all like 55 years old now.
[91:37.01]That was an entire commercial.
[91:38.59]30 seconds of just that.
[91:40.36]I got a tattoo of the was up, guys.
[91:42.02]I don't regret it.
[91:43.32]Remember the frogs?
[91:45.58]Who's that?
[91:47.84]The Budweiser frog.
[91:49.02]Budweiser.
[91:50.93]Schrodinger with $100 says, here's half my paycheck for this great cause.
[91:55.91]Can't wait for the jump segment tomorrow.
[91:57.61]Shout out to some of my favorite streamers, TruckTruck, Tag, and RaiseFire.

[92:31.75]Jerma and I are turning 31 this week.
[92:36.36]You guys realize I got you both beat, right?
[92:39.57]Yeah, but you're the Scout voice actor.
[92:41.01]31.
[92:42.95]Right.
[92:43.47]You're the Scout's age all the time.
[92:46.02]You're the Scout's age all the time.
[92:47.54]How old is he?
[92:48.08]Like 24, 23?
[92:49.38]The Scout is six, I think, isn't he?
[92:51.91]Six.
[92:53.53]He's six years old.
[92:55.15]No wonder he has so many OP unlocks.
[92:56.90]He just can't.
[92:57.56]Control them.
[92:58.14]I was reading your character sketch.
[92:59.60]It was enlightening.
[93:02.30]Six.
[93:03.27]Yeah, we do have some birthdays.
[93:04.97]I am turning 31.
[93:06.19]He got me with that one.
[93:09.10]Turning 24.
[93:09.46]The reason I'm saying this is because I am right after.
[93:13.92]This guy's old.
[93:16.00]Well, we are reaching $115,000 at the end of day two here.
[93:22.37]Can we make it?
[93:23.27]That is the question.
[93:24.37]I think we are going to.
[93:25.68]What do you guys think?
[93:27.62]I mean, if Rick Flame can come back in such a strong way, I believe.
[93:31.75]Yeah, I think Rick Flame is going to be the one to make it past the landmark.
[93:36.07]I think he's just waiting.
[93:36.97]He's waiting to pick his spot.
[93:38.32]He's got those unusuals ready to plunk down.
[93:41.65]He's gonna plunk him.
[93:42.61]Plunk.
[93:43.12]He's getting ready to plunk.
[93:44.84]Here comes Rick.
[93:46.35]Long stance.
[93:48.35]He's got his finger held over that plunk button.
[93:50.30]He's about to pop.
[93:52.91]He's about to pop.
[93:56.37]Once you plunk.
[93:57.67]Once you plunk, you never suck.
[94:00.54]Dollar 35 from Zapkin, who says, Donating the rest of my PayPal account because food is for suckers.
[94:06.15]I love your cause.
[94:06.95]Keep the dreams alive for the kids.
[94:08.39]Now, you don't have to donate your whole account.
[94:13.30]Keep your login and password to yourself.
[94:16.51]We don't need that.
[94:18.39]This person's name is, is Rick Flame still funny?
[94:20.89]Can we ban them?
[94:21.79]Let's get rid of that person.
[94:23.09]Yeah, get rid of that.
[94:24.51]I enjoy it.
[94:25.23]We don't need naysayers on the stream.
[94:28.48]Mr. D, sir, with $50, says, let's hit that 115,000.
[94:31.44]Polish Toaster.
[94:34.46]By Polish Toaster.
[94:35.65]And the rest of you guys are all coming in here.
[94:37.47]Or Polish Toaster.
[94:39.07]All glory to Rick Flame, is what he says.
[94:41.09]Perhaps.
[94:42.23]Could be Polish.
[94:43.63]Flopping.
[94:44.88]Polish Toaster.
[94:46.12]Polish.
[94:49.45]Polish Toaster says, $100.
[94:52.70]Smith, now that's a Polish name, isn't it?
[94:56.37]Always love to see you guys do this.

[94:59.09]Winky face.
[95:00.13]Heart sign, Heart Emotocon.
[95:02.74]And then in brackets, he, he, he, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho.
[95:06.04]Are you sure that's not the tracker just putting that in there at the end?
[95:09.91]The tracker's flipping out.
[95:11.09]The tracker's losing his mind.
[95:12.79]Who's messing with the tracker?
[95:14.23]But $115,000.
[95:16.20]We did it.
[95:16.62]Too bad that the joke had to be Rick Flame and not he, he, he.
[95:20.08]Thank you so much to everybody that's been donating.
[95:22.00]The running joke is he, he, he.
[95:23.03]It's going to be done tomorrow, that joke, and we'll have a new one.
[95:27.09]I hope so.
[95:28.25]Boy, do I hope so.
[95:28.97]There will be a new joke, so tune in tomorrow for now.
[95:31.76]If we hit the donation goal, there'll be a new joke.
[95:35.52]We'll be racking our brains all night just trying to think of one more joke.
[95:38.87]Well, some of us will.
[95:41.53]What does that mean?
[95:43.75]I don't know.
[95:44.87]Boy, where are we going with that?
[95:49.50]Hmm.
[95:50.38]Hmm.
[95:50.48]Well, the time marches on.
[95:52.76]We got Stabby still in here.
[95:54.12]We've got Rick, of course, of the Flame, the Family Flametongue.
[95:59.95]I don't know what that means.
[96:01.17]That's a totem in Warcraft.
[96:02.87]It is, yeah.
[96:03.43]Flametongue.
[96:03.89]Flametongue total.
[96:04.99]It's an alright card.
[96:05.94]It's an okay card.
[96:07.42]Nathan, are you a WoW player at all?
[96:09.48]Recovering.
[96:11.06]Recovering?
[96:11.70]I'm glad to hear.
[96:12.48]That's really brave to admit.
[96:15.09]I hit 285 days logged in on my main through TBC.
[96:21.42]So just through this first expansion.
[96:22.84]Yikes.
[96:24.34]The Burning Crusade.
[96:25.53]Wow.
[96:26.49]That's a lot of days.
[96:27.15]Was that Rick just getting a market?
[96:28.53]No, he didn't get a market garden kill.
[96:29.93]I'm sure he'll get 20 of them in a second, though.
[96:33.15]Retrospect again with $10.
[96:35.02]Here's some more cash.
[96:35.90]First time watching Tip of the Hats.
[96:36.94]Having a blast.
[96:37.50]Chili of Destiny stream represent.
[96:39.21]Thank you retrospect again for your cash.
[96:42.15]What up?
[96:43.26]What up?
[96:43.96]What up, dog?
[96:46.61]Legion's pretty good, though.
[96:48.31]I don't want to... I don't want to...
[96:50.82]I saw you were playing it the other day.
[96:52.80]It's fun.
[96:53.69]Not that I stalk you.
[96:56.79]Wow.
[96:56.89]Checks in the mail.
[96:58.26]Checks in the mail.
[97:00.96]You guys have collaborated before, Jerma and Nate, right?
[97:03.37]At least once.
[97:03.95]We streamed together a few times.
[97:05.41]Yeah, we streamed a few times.
[97:06.37]That's cool.
[97:07.62]Collab.
[97:08.04]But Jerma...
[97:09.26]Jerma and I had the falling out.
[97:11.59]Yeah, big falling out.
[97:12.37]Yeah, we all knew about that, of course.
[97:13.87]Yeah, huge falling out.
[97:14.87]Yeah.
[97:15.31]He called me a dummy, and I said, how dare you?
[97:17.46]And I never spoke to him again.
[97:18.70]Can't call you a douchebag on the air.
[97:22.41]I'm too sensitive.
[97:25.01]Yeah.
[97:25.71]Okay, for one second, I'm looking at the screen here, and I was turning over here to talk to you.
[97:32.22]I was like, what do you have to say to me?
[97:35.32]Guys, I'm worried about Jerma.
[97:36.78]I'm worried about Jerma, guys.
[97:39.07]Can we get him looked at?
[97:41.37]I see he's on the right over here, and I'm like, let me tell you something.
[97:47.81]Wrong guy.
[97:48.13]So we got FineGiant with $10.
[97:50.69]Great cause.
[97:51.51]Benefit from this community daily.
[97:53.65]Only wish I could give more.
[97:54.62]Thanks, guys, from FineGiant.
[97:56.44]I think his name is FineGant.
[97:59.16]Oh, yeah.
[98:00.12]It's actually FineGant.
[98:00.92]His name on Twitch.
[98:02.27]It's Finnegan.
[98:03.67]It's Finnegan.
[98:04.45]It's my eyes.
[98:04.99]I wanted to explain.
[98:06.69]Sorry.
[98:07.13]You do it, Kurt.
[98:07.75]It's really good.
[98:08.70]Okay.
[98:08.98]His name is FinneganTF2 on Twitch.
[98:15.03]We'll see you tomorrow on Tip of the Pants.
[98:17.51]That's it.
[98:17.91]That's the whole thing.
[98:18.69]His name's FinneganTF2.
[98:19.55]We call him Fine Gant, though, which is funnier to us.
[98:21.57]Yeah, because it's funnier, and we don't know how to read.
[98:23.74]I said Fine Giant because my eyes are bad, and I saw it on the screen.
[98:27.74]It's okay.
[98:28.40]Daddy needs his medicine.
[98:29.69]But thank you, nonetheless, Gant.
[98:31.19]Thank you so much.
[98:32.57]So Rick here going... Rick still... Oh, there's Geo Banana Peel, another $100.
[98:38.12]Oh, my goodness.
[98:39.32]How did he do that?
[98:40.52]He's been sitting here the whole time.
[98:42.28]He's got a robot set up at the house.
[98:47.04]Rick is going for the challenge here.
[98:51.02]Market gardening.
[98:52.14]He's gotten two so far.
[98:53.32]$10 from MK, who says, working on the i58 video with the stream in the background and loving every bit of it.
[99:01.01]I'll donate another $10 if Admirable says, welcome to Insomnia 58, the only time crowns successfully pushed.
[99:10.54]Maybe I'll render a short teaser.
[99:12.23]Let's get over here.

[99:14.69]He's got a headset.

[100:26.74]Where did everybody go?
[100:29.02]$100 from Gio Banana Peel.
[100:33.69]I wanted to donate earlier, but I couldn't gather the courage.
[100:36.49]Just wanted to say that I respect Admirable for playing, regardless of his skill level.
[100:41.32]It's truly wonderful to see even new players playing boldly.
[100:46.39]So there you go.
[100:48.56]Beautiful.
[100:48.78]Got him.
[100:49.30]Well.
[100:50.74]Passive aggressive.
[100:52.45]That's how Jill talks.
[100:54.97]Well, and there's a little tweet.
[100:57.41]Niagara Falls in a barrel.
[100:58.60]Someone has animated.
[100:59.70]Look at that fish.
[101:00.92]That's a beautiful SFM poster.
[101:03.07]Yeah, wow.
[101:03.57]Fish.
[101:04.15]It's great.
[101:04.95]Get that on Reddit.
[101:05.63]I'll updude it.
[101:06.37]Reddit, get in here.
[101:07.89]Lurkers.
[101:08.55]Reddit, get in here.
[101:10.28]Listen, Nathan, we've got to close up the segment here.
[101:13.98]But, well, we want to thank you for being here this evening with us.
[101:17.49]But we'll hopefully, as long as we hit that donation thing, we'll be able to have you back tomorrow.
[101:21.61]If not, don't expect a phone call.
[101:25.80]All jokes aside, Nathan, thank you so much for being here with us on the pub, and we'll see you tomorrow, my man.
[101:34.37]Cool.
[101:34.61]Thanks for having me, guys.
[101:35.45]Yeah, thank you.
[101:37.17]And so hopefully we will hit that incentive, guys, again, if we hit 10,000.
[101:40.50]And I believe, even though we're going off the air here shortly, people will be able to donate.
[101:44.96]That's an important thing, actually.
[101:46.17]We got, I think, about 1,000 bucks or something overnight last night.
[101:50.03]So if maybe you're watching the VOD, you're in a weird time zone or you're working or something like that, you got to see what you can get together to donate.
[101:57.68]You can do that even while we're not here.
[101:59.58]Another tweet there, some more fan art.
[102:01.26]Yeah, that's so good.
[102:02.20]Guys, keep tweeting.
[102:02.86]That's beautiful.
[102:03.60]Keep tweeting under that hashtag, Toth2016.
[102:06.31]We are going to be putting them up on the screen more and more.
[102:09.19]But anyway, so 10 grand.
[102:11.67]Tomorrow, we'll have the Scout voice actor.
[102:14.49]What was that?
[102:15.05]Was that your hand?
[102:15.82]150 bucks?
[102:16.28]Oh, yeah.
[102:17.06]$150.
[102:20.02]Just hanging out.
[102:22.41]Into the robot machine that causes that noise.
[102:25.91]Red hot.
[102:26.97]Into that computer talking noise that we all love.
[102:29.92]So that's one of our many challenges.
[102:31.26]You can see there again as well, we have the pipe launcher jump race and whatnot.
[102:34.90]If you've got a challenge that you think we should do or a challenge even, hit it up.
[102:39.71]But we're at 6,800, seven bucks.
[102:42.28]I feel confident we will have the voice of the Scout with us yesterday.
[102:46.72]Almost $7,000.
[102:47.62]Tomorrow in the pub.
[102:49.78]As for us, we're winding down.
[102:52.81]But again, you know, money, unusuals, items.
[102:55.19]They all go to the charity.
[102:56.17]That'll be available overnight.
[102:57.87]How about tomorrow?
[102:58.59]We got the schedule.
[102:59.76]We have our jump section, of course, tomorrow.
[103:01.62]That'll be a big deal.
[103:02.96]We have keep talking and nobody explodes.
[103:05.04]That'll be a cool thing.
[103:06.28]Hopefully we can get that.
[103:08.15]The speech jammer.
[103:09.07]I've never used a speech jammer.
[103:10.37]Have you used it?
[103:11.15]I have used one.
[103:12.27]I think it's just, if you just Google speech jammer, you'll get it.
[103:15.28]If you want to test it on yourself, it is unbelievably hard to talk.
[103:19.18]It puts us very funny.
[103:20.17]It puts like a very slight delay of your own voice in your ear and your brain freaks out.
[103:26.18]You can't do it.
[103:26.72]It's really funny.
[103:28.88]It's actually really hard to say any word.
[103:31.55]We actually should demo it in some way just to show people what it is.
[103:36.13]Are we able to do that live production?
[103:39.63]I don't know if we can do it right now.
[103:40.82]That's kind of a lot of pressure on production because they have to finagle the audio.
[103:45.06]We should probably do that because we'll have an anxiety attack.
[103:48.86]So that's a little preview of what we have.
[103:51.01]The full schedule, of course, is online at tipofthehats.org.
[103:54.33]That's where you can donate as well, tipofthehats.org.
[103:57.35]donate.
[103:58.27]I don't know.
[103:58.61]Do we have anything else we wanted to cover?
[104:00.54]Donations?
[104:01.44]Thank you guys so much for donating.
[104:03.78]It's been a tremendous event so far.
[104:08.57]George, you'll be back tomorrow?
[104:10.31]I will be back tomorrow.
[104:11.53]George will be here.
[104:13.16]He'll be top bragging.
[104:15.16]So listen, we had a ton of fun today.
[104:16.60]If you liked today,
[104:17.80]Tomorrow's the ending, the banger ending.
[104:20.21]And we'll be looking to top it tomorrow.
[104:22.35]And let's see what we can do with that money.
[104:23.87]You know what I mean?
[104:24.51]When we end the stream here now, I'll see what I can contribute.
[104:27.04]And I'm going to beat up Kurt if he doesn't contribute.
[104:29.80]I'll beat him up bigger than him.
[104:32.63]No, you're not.
[104:34.45]I was going to say that you guys are clearly the same size.
[104:37.93]You measured yesterday.
[104:39.30]No, I don't know what that means.
[104:42.24]Well, anyway, we are closing out day two.
[104:46.89]We got 12 more hours tomorrow.
[104:49.07]Like I said, donations are open overnight.
[104:51.65]If you want to come and play with us tomorrow, you certainly can.
[104:54.02]We'll have the pubs and whatnot.
[104:55.98]Let's end it off there.
[104:57.60]Thank you for being here with us for day two.
[104:59.51]We'll see you tomorrow for day three right here on twitch.tv/tip of the hats.
[105:06.42]Good night.
[105:14.67]A whole year to come back.
[105:20.28]I'm Caelid.
[105:21.32]When I was just about out of treatment, my nurse practitioner recommended camp to me.
[105:26.30]I just thought it was really fun that I could go somewhere where everybody would know what I've been through.
[105:30.71]When I'm talking to people who aren't involved with camp about camp, I could talk four or five hours about it.
[105:36.36]Outside in what I call the real world, they're kids with cancer, but here they get to be kids for two weeks.
[105:41.74]We were just playing paint twister, and then it really escalated into a giant paint fight.
[105:47.41]just put all the cares of the world away.
[105:49.42]There's still the medical things in the background that we help take care of to make sure they're safe and still being treated if they need to be treated, but it's not up front.
[105:56.89]Up front, you're a kid, you're having fun, you're doing things that other kids do at summer camps that these kids don't always get to do.
[106:02.85]My favorite thing to do is go swimming and play with my friends.
[106:06.30]Baking, fishing, arts and crafts.
[106:09.84]Archery, softballs.
[106:12.47]I've met so many great people here, just campers and counselors that I can relate to.
[106:17.77]We completely forget about our cancer and we just go along with it and we treat everybody the same.
[106:24.28]I am an attending physician at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and I'm one of the medical directors of the Children's Oncology Services.
[106:31.71]We have nurses and physicians and advanced practice nurses out in the programs with the children so that all the medical needs can be taken care of.
[106:39.29]I take care of a lot of these kids in the clinic.
[106:41.41]And to be able to see them out here interacting with their peers, having a blast is the best.
[106:47.20]There's no need to sort of halt any treatment.
[106:49.81]Things can go on as normal.
[106:51.53]And the best part about it is that it's sort of seamless so that they don't feel like they're missing out on anything.
[106:56.42]Come even if you are nervous about it because everybody here really gets you.
[107:02.05]Everyone loves each other and would do anything for each other.
[107:05.81]It makes you comfortable then talking to just regular people that really probably doesn't really understand your situation.
[107:12.00]And you don't have to explain every little thing like about the treatments because they just know what's going on because they've been through the same thing.
[107:18.04]Everyone's so much fun and we all act like family and I can be myself around everyone.
[107:22.65]It's a family that extends beyond this week.
[107:24.79]You get such a close bond with someone who shares something so intimate as a disease that even after camp's over,
[107:31.63]You end up keeping in touch with these people.
[107:33.75]One Step has so many different programs throughout the year that you get to see your friends more often.
[107:37.82]I never want to leave this camp.
[107:39.68]This is the best place to be.
[107:42.02]It's like a second home to me.
[107:43.40]I tell my sisters and my mom and my dad when I get back, I have too much fun that I forget about them.
[107:50.81]I've heard many campers say this, that they wouldn't actually give up having cancer because without cancer, they wouldn't have camp.
[107:57.26]Sometimes people think, oh, since you had cancer, you can't do these things, but just watch me and I will.
