[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.56]Hey, what's up?
[00:06.01]Dropping some frames here right in the beginning.
[00:09.69]That's not a good sign.
[00:15.47]Stable now, I guess.
[00:18.27]Uh-oh.
[00:19.57]Now, how you guys doing?
[00:22.57]What are we doing?
[00:23.07]Today we're going to be doing something that's not the Nintendo vibe.
[00:26.52]I'm sorry.
[00:27.88]The vibe has not come in completely yet.
[00:31.23]It'll all be here tomorrow.
[00:34.27]According to Amazon.org.
[00:36.79]Because I bought some extra stuff.
[00:43.04]My room is not really... I can't just have the default Vive setup.
[00:49.16]I had to get... Fuck, we're dropping frames again.
[00:53.43]I had to get those stands.
[00:56.65]Because this room is not really... I can't really mount those things anywhere.
[01:05.39]So I'm gonna have two stands that are in the corners pointing down.
[01:11.45]And they're not here.
[01:15.20]On the ceiling?
[01:15.76]No, they're two, like, tripod stands.
[01:18.86]That I have to screw those, um, what are they called?
[01:21.32]The trackers?
[01:23.02]Not the trackers.
[01:23.66]They're like little squares.
[01:25.36]They're like boxes.
[01:27.07]I don't know what HTC calls them.
[01:32.69]The lighthouses.
[01:33.47]Okay.
[01:34.11]Yeah.
[01:36.20]But I'm excited.
[01:37.24]I'm excited to, like, VR my room for real.
[01:39.86]Because... The PSVR was fun, but it was very... It was very limited.
[01:45.80]I had to, like, be sitting down.
[01:47.10]I had, like, that small cord.
[01:48.64]I did have a lot of fun with PSVR.
[01:52.82]But I'm excited to kind of graduate to the big boy machine.
[01:57.27]Like, the Vive.
[02:00.17]The Vive looks better.
[02:01.75]It's more comfortable.
[02:02.93]And it's more versatile.
[02:04.79]So I'm looking forward to it.
[02:06.83]So here's the plan.
[02:09.29]I got a new schedule here for you.
[02:12.07]If we can stream today... I don't know why I'm dropping so many frames.
[02:16.43]Let me make sure nothing weird is going on here.
[02:20.09]I don't understand.
[02:26.26]No, I'm like, I got nothing going on.
[02:28.54]It just kind of happens.
[02:30.86]But, the plan is today... Remember that species evolution game I was talking about?
[02:38.34]Like a few days ago?
[02:40.10]Where you have to like make spore creatures and they eat each other and mate and they evolve?
[02:46.14]It looks really fun.
[02:48.84]It's called Species Artificial Intelligence Real Evolution.
[02:54.95]I think.
[03:04.85]Oh, the second channel finally got to the Boston to Vegas arc?
[03:11.34]Yes, it did.
[03:19.82]They're on a different timeline.
[03:26.28]Is this the game with the annoying stalk splash sound effect?
[03:29.08]No, no, no, no, no.
[03:30.04]This is a PC game.
[03:31.34]It's on Steam.
[03:32.99]There's just no... It's not a category on Twitch.
[03:36.81]So I can't... I can't even change the category.
[03:42.13]Because it's not on the Twitch's directory or whatever.
[03:52.50]But we have kind of a different problem here.
[03:55.84]And that is... I guess it's one of those days where I'm going to drop 10% of every frame.
[04:03.99]It's been, what, five minutes?
[04:05.07]That's why I'm kind of just sitting here.
[04:07.19]I'm, like, waiting.
[04:09.37]To see if this corrects itself.
[04:12.69]But.
[04:14.51]Uh, so, I've, look, let me get, like, I gotta give you some, uh, some information here.
[04:18.65]So, the Vive did not come completely yet.
[04:22.22]I'm still waiting on it.
[04:24.58]I... am going to do the Vive stuff...
[04:29.63]On Valentine's Day.
[04:31.41]So from Valentine's Day, which is Thursday.
[04:35.51]So today is Tuesday.
[04:36.61]Yeah, so Thursday, Friday, Saturday is going to be the Vive stuff.
[04:40.07]Because tomorrow is my anniversary with Kim.
[04:45.82]For two years.
[04:47.58]So we're going to go have some fun.
[04:49.92]We're going to go do something.
[04:52.36]And so Valentine's Day, we're kind of doing like a dual Valentine's Day thing here.
[04:56.91]Where it's anniversary and Valentine's Day, but it's not Valentine's, not yet.
[05:01.17]So.
[05:02.45]That's where I'm going to be tomorrow.
[05:04.94]And I'm trying to just swallow my anger right now.
[05:07.90]Like as deeply into my stomach as I can.
[05:12.42]Fucking internet.
[05:14.76]I'm like eating this anger.
[05:17.00]I'm eating it.
[05:20.09]It's like a monster that keeps coming out of my mouth and I keep chewing him and swallowing him back down.
[05:27.75]He's getting really angry at his fucking anniversary.
[05:31.27]No.
[05:38.23]Just let it all out.
[05:42.83]No, it's not worth turning the stream off.
[05:50.22]Try getting two ISPs at once.
[05:57.02]Somebody, like, pissed on the box or something, wherever it is.
[06:02.68]How do you beat Orphan of Kos?
[06:05.04]There's a point where he goes... And you have to run away, because he's going to make the whole place electricity.
[06:13.54]Don't attack him when he does that.
[06:19.04]A lot of people just go in for the kill when he does that, and the whole place becomes electrified.
[06:22.60]You don't want to do that.
[06:23.92]That's how you get yourself killed.
[06:31.88]Alright, I'm going to attempt.
[06:34.56]I'm going to attempt here.
[06:39.04]To open up the game.
[06:41.86]God damn it.
[06:43.80]But yes.
[06:46.62]Hey look, there it is.
[06:49.10]Nothing tomorrow.
[06:49.82]Anniversary with my girlfriend.
[06:52.06]And then we're going to do Thursday, Friday, Saturday with the Vive.
[06:56.24]And then next week
[07:00.60]I've got a PS3 game that I'm incredibly excited for.
[07:04.14]It's a safari game where you take pictures of animals.
[07:07.20]That's the whole game.
[07:07.88]It's not Pokemon Snap.
[07:09.87]It's for PS3.
[07:10.65]It's called Africa.
[07:13.31]With a K. I'm excited for it.
[07:20.00]But this game in particular, this is called Species Artificial Life Reel Filler for Vive.
[07:27.46]Is what this one's called.
[07:32.26]No, no, no, I kid.
[07:33.14]This is gonna be fun, this is gonna be cool.
[07:37.86]So, how this works, I've kind of done a very basic look at this game.
[07:43.35]You get a randomly generated seed, randomly generated world, and you have to essentially watch and take care of and watch over slugs.
[07:54.64]These slugs then evolve
[07:58.11]over the course of the game into anything.
[08:00.83]They mate with each other, they eat each other, and they can turn into fucking anything.
[08:05.41]If you've seen the trailer of this game, I recommend you do.
[08:08.95]Because it looks wild.
[08:12.86]Yeah, that's how I feel right now.
[08:15.88]Yeah.
[08:17.56]That is a germ of Pluto right there.
[08:18.74]That's how I feel right now with the internet being a piece of shit.
[08:24.92]That actually does look like it.
[08:30.42]They could smell how, they could just, I'm telling you, the computers can hear this shit.
[08:37.42]But world style, we're gonna just kind of do whatever the defaults are for now.
[08:42.33]We might go a little deeper.
[08:47.40]But it's kind of been on the radar for a little while since it came.
[08:49.67]It's an early access game, which I don't really like to play early access games.
[08:55.27]Especially on stream, because they could be void of content.
[08:58.57]There could be like nothing here.
[09:00.43]That's why I don't really like to do them.
[09:01.49]But it looked interesting enough where we could have a little bit of fun.
[09:05.36]And it's freaking out.
[09:08.14]It is, it is, it is.
[09:11.94]Why does my screen look like it's melting?
[09:15.26]It shouldn't.
[09:18.27]So I'm going to have to save frequently.
[09:19.92]We're going to save frequently and get this gone.
[09:27.78]Fucking internet, man.
[09:28.56]This is just like Happy Gilmore situation where like Bob Barker.
[09:35.91]I'm just like, ugh.
[09:43.11]Why is the screen all red?
[09:44.13]Is it?
[09:44.35]Is it?
[09:47.19]Actually, I gotta make a text here.
[09:48.78]Hold on.
[09:50.94]Let me just text.
[09:51.82]I gotta text somebody.
[09:54.86]I'm gonna give somebody a warning here.
[10:08.39]Texting in 2019.
[10:16.40]Now, I'm giving italics a warning.
[10:18.96]Because I think he was potentially starting his stream in like a little bit here.
[10:22.32]And it's like, well, I don't know.
[10:23.66]Be careful with that.
[10:27.77]Texting and streaming.
[10:28.79]Yep, sometimes.
[10:30.49]But alright, let's go.
[10:31.19]Let's just try.
[10:31.69]I can't sit here and cry over spilt... I almost just said something that I would have regretted.
[10:40.20]You can probably fill that in.
[10:41.08]I'm getting better at that.
[10:43.50]I'm getting better at that.
[10:47.03]Don't cry over spilled... milk.
[10:50.07]Right?
[10:50.27]But I was gonna say cocks.
[10:52.11]Don't- I've been- I've been getting very good at that.
[10:55.19]Just has to happen enough times.
[11:00.63]Alright.
[11:00.95]Alright, so I like- so far I like it.
[11:08.93]Pretty- pretty default.
[11:12.13]Oh god.
[11:13.17]This is a little too loud.
[11:15.05]Didn't I turn the music down?
[11:20.39]I can't adjust it now.
[11:25.25]All right, so here we go, here we go.
[11:26.40]So it starts out like this.
[11:28.60]We've got, all right.
[11:44.37]Okay, that's manageable.
[11:48.53]So new world.
[11:52.12]It's the same one we were just on.
[11:55.66]To me this is not evolution music.
[11:58.10]I'll be honest.
[12:01.70]This is like going down the tunnel.
[12:06.22]In a third person driving crime game.
[12:09.80]That is not Grand Theft Auto.
[12:19.64]Alright, so I got controls.
[12:20.78]I got time acceleration, which is 1, 2, 3.
[12:22.72]This is what I got to work with here.
[12:25.08]So everything starts off as a slug.
[12:28.25]As you can see, everybody has like a Sims meter.
[12:31.03]So this is health, this is food, and this is stamina.
[12:34.63]Let's take a look and see where we want to go.
[12:41.39]I think everybody starts off with the same thing, and I get to choose kind of who mates with who.
[12:49.82]The music just kind of abruptly stopped.
[12:51.31]That was a little odd.
[12:52.65]But, okay.
[12:53.95]I think we're good.
[12:56.81]That was really jarring.
[12:59.91]Alright, so take a look.
[13:01.63]We got species.
[13:02.35]Uh, I can do... I think I can, like, look at... There we go.
[13:09.62]Number of creatures, survival, not... Uh, I don't know.
[13:13.64]Age, 60.
[13:13.96]How are they aging this fast?
[13:16.97]I don't like the... Okay, there we go.
[13:18.47]Health capacity...
[13:20.32]Age out of 90?
[13:21.44]How long do they live?
[13:24.56]Cold-blooded.
[13:25.20]28 optimal temperature.
[13:27.50]What temperature is it outside right now?
[13:29.91]Gluttony.
[13:32.03]Angry.
[13:32.31]He's about to die!
[13:34.51]Feed him!
[13:34.89]Quick!
[13:35.23]I can feed him.
[13:36.21]Food.
[13:36.47]Alright, so food's going good.
[13:39.83]No, don't kill.
[13:42.79]When do they mate?
[13:44.09]Alright, get these tutorials off the screen.
[13:51.27]There they are.
[13:52.75]What happens at 90?
[13:53.65]Do they all just die?
[13:58.55]Physiology.
[13:59.15]Okay, this is just a few of the values defining physical structure.
[14:02.81]So this shows how long the creature is before it dies, how tall it is, the volume, the mass, the head scale.
[14:08.69]Okay, we got a save point.
[14:13.09]Let's see.
[14:13.57]Overview.
[14:15.23]62.
[14:15.81]They're very sleepy.
[14:17.88]Anybody else, like, alive over here?
[14:22.46]Alright, I don't want to play with those guys.
[14:23.62]They're gonna die.
[14:24.90]What about these ones?
[14:27.88]Starving.
[14:28.42]Oh god.
[14:29.40]Okay, these are... I gotta feed them.
[14:40.62]There we go.
[14:41.00]Alright.
[14:41.52]So, we're gonna deal with these over here.
[14:45.69]How do I make, like, food bins?
[14:49.39]Oh, you just can do it.
[14:50.19]How many times can I do this?
[14:52.39]How many times can I do this?
[14:55.48]Okay.
[14:57.14]Because this is their hunger meter.
[14:59.78]This is stamina meter.
[15:04.18]Ten community subs just came in from WhiffWhiffSci.
[15:06.62]Thank you, WhiffWhiffSci.
[15:09.20]Ten community subs.
[15:11.01]Whoa, whoa, this one's got bigger.
[15:12.03]This one got bigger.
[15:15.81]How did this one get bigger?
[15:18.27]Oh, they...
[15:20.40]Look, we have, okay, okay, okay, this is good, this is good.
[15:22.26]Forget about everybody else in the whole planet.
[15:25.28]Sniffs.
[15:25.72]Oh, hold on.
[15:27.54]They're multiplying.
[15:30.74]Omnivore.
[15:31.50]They eat grass.
[15:33.70]So what happens when they run out of grass?
[15:43.46]Potato slugs.
[15:47.02]Wait, wait, wait, I think we have, no, they're just multiplying.
[15:51.22]Energy.
[15:51.72]Okay, so stamina.
[15:55.46]Draining its stamina somehow.
[15:56.46]I think they're just impregnating themselves.
[15:59.40]Yeah.
[15:59.68]They're like a single-celled organism.
[16:02.49]Genetics.
[16:03.65]A, C, G, T, T, T, G, T, T, T, G, G, G, G, T, T, T, T, T. I don't know what that means.
[16:09.09]Uh, it's a placeholder.
[16:11.09]Okay.
[16:13.47]Okay.
[16:13.97]A more thorough explanation of the genetic system will be implemented at a later date.
[16:16.24]It's a placeholder.
[16:18.34]Creature energy, health, food, stamina.
[16:22.03]Alright, that sounds good.
[16:26.63]It's just a hash.
[16:28.09]It's somebody's password.
[16:31.19]What happens when they come over to this species over here?
[16:33.47]They're all the same species, right?
[16:36.23]This one dying?
[16:39.33]We have to focus on, like, just the big ones, I think.
[16:45.10]Alright, hold on.
[16:45.42]Genetic engineering.
[16:46.22]Oops.
[16:51.17]Uh, well I killed that one.
[16:52.79]Why would you have feed next to kill?
[16:56.29]Genetic engineering.
[16:59.57]Draw bones.
[17:00.31]Animation.
[17:04.36]Skin type.
[17:05.58]Secondary saturation.
[17:06.64]Alright, hold on.
[17:10.02]What about like a brain?
[17:12.76]This one's gonna have a brain.
[17:16.34]Gluttony?
[17:17.02]Oh, I can change how they- how they feel.
[17:20.02]Aggression?
[17:22.95]Hold on, head.
[17:24.57]Neck length.
[17:26.81]Neck.
[17:28.45]Neck length.
[17:31.51]Oh no.
[17:34.77]Alright, let's not get too carried away yet.
[17:36.65]We need to have, this has to be natural.
[17:46.07]Now I can't make him like a tetherball, not yet.
[17:52.16]Just five.
[17:53.52]That's fine.
[17:58.89]It's got to be natural.
[18:00.69]Head scale.
[18:06.75]You can do anything you want, huh?
[18:08.62]But I need them to evolve into each other.
[18:10.24]So head type.
[18:11.06]Ooh, I can add... I definitely have to have the underbite.
[18:14.64]I like the underbite.
[18:17.52]Yeah, underbite.
[18:23.81]No, that doesn't look right.
[18:28.07]We have to start easy.
[18:29.51]I don't want it just to go crazy.
[18:33.24]Okay, number of features.
[18:35.00]Number of facial features.
[18:43.22]Face?
[18:43.56]Uh-oh.
[18:49.18]What if I drop this back down to where it was?
[18:54.07]Alright, face.
[18:55.23]Feature type 1.
[18:56.01]A horn?
[19:00.14]Texture.
[19:01.32]Size.
[19:07.88]Okay, we'll get a horn.
[19:09.36]Alright, the next thing, I'm gonna make Spider-Man, I think.
[19:14.83]No, stop!
[19:15.69]Just do it normal.
[19:16.51]Do it regular.
[19:17.19]Not yet.
[19:17.57]It's been like 20 minutes.
[19:24.43]There they go, he's got eyes.
[19:27.83]Just keep... We're gonna do slug and slug, okay?
[19:31.87]Tail... Um... Give him a tail too.
[19:35.50]Give him like a little... Like sausage casing for a tail.
[19:45.22]That's alright, it's like a little snake thing.
[19:47.44]I'm gonna make the neck a little thicker too.
[19:51.28]Size... Maybe a little bigger?
[19:55.38]Okay.
[19:57.50]Limbs?
[19:58.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[19:59.86]We have to... We're gonna go make another person over here, and we're gonna give them arms.
[20:07.29]Uh, this is gonna be called... Gotta think of a good initial creature name.
[20:17.43]It's like Slugonius... Uh...
[20:26.97]Slugoni is Hornopolis.
[20:28.37]Whatever.
[20:28.67]Who gives a shit?
[20:30.78]This is our first creature.
[20:31.76]The game crashed.
[20:42.20]God damn it.
[20:44.39]When did it save?
[20:45.37]I had a creature made, too.
[20:46.73]That sucks.
[20:49.37]Where was it?
[20:55.67]It was too OP.
[20:56.83]No, it was this guy right here.
[20:57.87]Alright, I can do it again.
[21:00.39]Did it save it?
[21:02.73]There it is, right there.
[21:04.67]We're good.
[21:04.97]It crashed again.
[21:09.43]Shit.
[21:17.60]God damn it.
[21:18.40]Really?
[21:23.45]Is it too cursed?
[21:24.63]No, it can't be.
[21:28.31]Try it on somebody else.
[21:31.82]Export creature.
[21:33.30]Slugonius Hornopolis.
[21:34.66]Generate.
[21:37.60]Did it work?
[21:43.92]Is this... Did it turn into... I don't see it.
[21:45.84]No, this is... This is not it.
[21:48.79]That's not it, right?
[21:49.39]Are you going to evolve into that?
[21:59.39]I don't... So I overrit... Alright, hold on a second.
[22:11.52]Let's fucking do this one more time.
[22:16.58]I overwrote it.
[22:17.46]Alright, well, let's try this again.
[22:30.32]This has so much potential if it worked.
[22:33.89]You understand?
[22:34.29]This is like... There's so many options.
[22:35.99]There's so much to do.
[22:39.33]If I didn't crash the game five times in ten minutes.
[22:42.59]Alright, let's go with that.
[22:47.40]I just want to see if I can get it to work.
[22:48.76]Alright, that looks good.
[23:00.46]I'll give it a tail, too.
[23:04.71]And a long tail.
[23:06.43]There we go.
[23:06.71]All right, generate.
[23:11.11]Slugonius Horopolis.
[23:12.29]It doesn't matter if it doesn't have a horn.
[23:18.86]How about this one?
[23:29.97]I don't know.
[23:30.81]Whatever.
[23:32.31]Crashed again.
[23:33.19]Fuck!
[23:36.33]Hold on.
[23:36.91]Let me try something else here.
[23:45.40]I'm gonna, like, go to, like, a different version.
[23:53.66]I had, like, the new, like, update.
[23:56.68]And I'm gonna just try to do it without that update.
[24:03.31]Let's try it again.
[24:05.73]Just do something easy.
[24:11.12]Just make it like a fucking tube sock, for all I care.
[24:15.02]Generate.
[24:17.10]Shlomo char, who cares.
[24:19.50]Alright, it worked, right?
[24:26.40]Which one was it?
[24:26.82]It was this one right here, right?
[24:33.39]I can't tell.
[24:33.91]Did it do anything?
[24:37.72]Oxygen.
[24:38.28]Needing... It needs oxygen!
[24:40.20]Are there too many people?
[24:41.16]There's too many bugs!
[24:48.08]Speed up the time.
[24:48.88]Alright, which one was it?
[24:49.56]It was this one right here, right?
[24:50.34]Let me look at the genetics.
[24:54.88]Overview.
[24:58.42]Swim stamina... Why is it dying?
[25:01.98]Why is this thing dying?
[25:04.36]What the fuck was that?
[25:05.24]Why did that just happen?
[25:06.54]Did you just kill it?
[25:10.34]They were eating each other.
[25:11.70]You just killed my creation.
[25:21.95]When you've got a creature selected, you can see their state over there.
[25:25.39]People are just dying.
[25:32.58]What?
[25:38.36]Genetics.
[25:39.80]Physiology.
[25:40.46]This is just how hard and long it is.
[25:44.30]Energy.
[25:45.30]This is how hungry it is.
[25:46.44]Okay.
[25:54.10]Creature energy.
[25:55.28]I read these already.
[25:59.33]Creature genetics.
[26:00.15]This is a base for- yeah, yeah.
[26:03.28]This is the premium specimen.
[26:05.40]This is like the original of this one here.
[26:07.70]Gene editor.
[26:09.14]Design creatures by specifying their genetic values.
[26:12.34]Synthetic genomes can be exported and used as target genomes in the nursery.
[26:16.99]Okay, hold on.
[26:17.47]Where's the nursery?
[26:20.85]Nursery, nursery, nursery, nursery!
[26:24.22]Alright.
[26:25.00]Welcome to the nursery.
[26:25.84]Here you can experiment with artificial selection pressures.
[26:28.90]Drop in a creature or two and then design or import a target genome with the gene editor.
[26:34.70]The nursery will encourage creatures similar to the target to breed while humanely killing off the rest.
[26:41.14]Drag a creature in here.
[26:43.88]Capture a creature with the move tool.
[26:45.36]Okay.
[26:45.60]Why are they on fire?
[26:49.37]Why are they all burning?
[26:51.35]What?
[26:53.17]That's not the music you should be playing.
[27:03.15]There are too many of them.
[27:04.13]We have to just find the one that's going to survive.
[27:06.79]Alright, it's definitely not these ones.
[27:09.87]Is everybody dead?
[27:14.64]No, there's a whole thriving colony over here of burning insects.
[27:18.18]I have to drop the temperature?
[27:21.26]Cool it down.
[27:27.28]Why are they just burning?
[27:33.52]Delicious meat.
[27:36.10]They've been burnt, apparently.
[27:37.58]Alright, I need to at least make one monster.
[27:39.92]So, here's the nursery.
[27:44.84]So, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:46.68]Where's the healthiest one?
[27:48.98]Alright, you look pretty healthy.
[27:50.24]Come here.
[27:54.28]Get over here.
[27:56.35]Welcome to the nursery.
[27:56.95]Here you can experiment with artificial light.
[27:58.13]Yeah, I know.
[27:59.25]I'm trying to grab somebody.
[28:00.11]Okay.
[28:06.09]No.
[28:06.35]I don't want... I want the one underneath you.
[28:07.47]I want the one that's on fire.
[28:11.39]It's too hot.
[28:13.95]Alright.
[28:14.17]You look good.
[28:14.93]Come here.
[28:17.15]In nursery.
[28:17.61]Alright.
[28:17.83]We've got a drone coming over here.
[28:18.91]I need another one.
[28:21.05]How are you doing?
[28:21.82]You're almost dead, but we'll keep you alive a little longer.
[28:26.72]I'm not gonna stop breeding in the nursery.
[28:29.56]Wait a minute.
[28:32.54]Where the fuck did you come from?
[28:33.52]How did you get that mouth?
[28:36.04]What the fuck?
[28:37.04]Why?
[28:37.48]Why are they exploding?
[28:39.80]Why can they not live in here?
[28:42.26]What?
[28:43.32]It's too hot.
[28:48.83]I made that mouth.
[28:52.79]Oh my god.
[28:53.61]Okay, nursery.
[28:56.11]Applied radiation.
[29:01.75]Edit target.
[29:02.57]Okay.
[29:07.29]Let's just go for a long neck again.
[29:09.56]I can't even see what it looks like, but whatever.
[29:13.66]Generate it.
[29:16.64]Everyone exploded.
[29:17.34]And there's no sounds.
[29:22.42]Are the drones smashing into everybody?
[29:28.91]Is it still too hot?
[29:31.39]Why do you want it at negative two?
[29:33.95]Now it's too cold.
[29:35.63]And now it's too hot.
[29:40.58]I need land fertility.
[29:45.14]Increase the fertility of the land.
[29:46.46]They need more- They've been eating too much!
[29:54.43]We need oxygen!
[29:57.56]I told you we're looking into the petri dish.
[30:02.58]So we need more fertile land.
[30:05.80]Increase water fertility.
[30:07.22]Look, we're just gonna raise the water level.
[30:10.22]No, no, no, no, lower the water level.
[30:11.50]That'll kill everybody.
[30:15.44]Okay, we'll do more land fertility.
[30:17.24]Eat it as soon as it gets here.
[30:20.59]It's just overpopulation.
[30:26.27]I don't have any more.
[30:30.03]Alright, how do I get a- how do I do, like, a plague?
[30:33.83]They're breeding too fast!
[30:36.34]And this is just one section of the island.
[30:37.98]Alright, what about these?
[30:40.10]Look at these guys.
[30:41.26]These guys look okay.
[30:45.02]Let's manually feed these guys.
[30:47.12]I'm gonna get this.
[30:47.90]I'm gonna figure this out.
[30:49.80]Chode diagram.
[30:53.45]Rover.
[30:53.85]Allow you to drive rovers.
[30:54.93]Okay, rovers.
[30:56.51]Add a rover.
[30:58.34]Alright, this is the fucking what I'm looking for here.
[31:00.25]Feed.
[31:02.01]Feed creatures with high stats and big size.
[31:10.47]What?
[31:15.31]What the fuck is this?
[31:18.08]No, no, no.
[31:19.00]High stats.
[31:20.16]Size.
[31:20.98]Drive.
[31:21.30]Go.
[31:23.76]Go.
[31:26.77]Okay, let's make like fucking four of them.
[31:29.05]No, kill population when total creatures are higher than 200.
[31:34.73]We gotta start to mitigate some of this.
[31:49.92]Statistic, okay, when there's two, drive that around, go.
[31:54.22]Feed the creatures with low hunger, right?
[32:02.57]So somebody's feeding them to keep them alive, and one of them's killing them when there's too many.
[32:08.07]This is very counterproductive, I think.
[32:13.94]Uh, feed with stomach high, stomach low.
[32:19.82]Stamina diet.
[32:23.06]Reach, Mass, Armor, Insulation, HP, Energy.
[32:28.57]Energy low, right?
[32:29.69]That's what we're looking for.
[32:30.53]I got the wrong game listed because this game is not on Twitch.
[32:40.53]I cannot make this game a selectable game in the directory.
[32:44.99]So it's Dagmont with the closest damn thing I could.
[32:47.13]All right, low energy.
[32:50.25]Go.
[32:55.22]What the fuck?
[32:55.82]Hold on.
[32:57.68]I have to drive this thing?
[33:04.47]No, it's already dead.
[33:05.93]How do you feed?
[33:06.63]I have to... Why wouldn't I just use my mouse?
[33:18.56]Don't damage them.
[33:19.26]They're very expensive.
[33:20.06]Alright, well get me out of this.
[33:21.74]Let them do it on their own.
[33:26.62]Okay, so we've got a lot of issues.
[33:29.51]Okay, yeah, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good.
[33:31.61]See?
[33:32.71]They're killing and... Hold on, I need to see that from a different angle.
[33:43.78]Details and stats.
[33:45.38]How do I get out of the fucking rover?
[33:52.52]I gotta get out of the rover.
[33:56.87]Diagram, nursery, rovers, ecosystem mode, okay.
[34:01.74]There we go.
[34:05.14]Species selection mode.
[34:08.06]Creature selection mode.
[34:14.34]How do I get the fuck out of the rover?
[34:17.96]Toggle indirect, okay.
[34:19.16]Toggle camera mode.
[34:20.10]There, oh wait, what the fuck?
[34:21.78]All right, we're good.
[34:26.33]Showing thoughts, all right.
[34:28.71]So now, I got a rover blasting around, feeding and killing.
[34:33.99]How we doing over here?
[34:34.59]This thing is murdering everybody.
[34:45.51]This doesn't seem correct.
[34:50.09]Maybe I should just put this one on... No, no, okay.
[34:51.91]I need to put this one on feed because this one is killing them before they even have a chance.
[34:55.65]No, stop that.
[34:56.27]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[34:57.77]How do I control you?
[34:58.84]Stop.
[35:01.38]Which one is killing?
[35:03.84]No, feed.
[35:06.40]When creature count... No, no, no, no.
[35:09.80]Feed trees.
[35:12.78]With low energy.
[35:13.83]Feed trees.
[35:15.77]Do it.
[35:15.99]Okay.
[35:18.77]Alright, they're not going to be killing them anymore.
[35:20.31]I need to... I want to make something!
[35:23.66]How you doing?
[35:24.52]This one looks healthy.
[35:25.46]What about in the nursery?
[35:27.54]Oh, wait a minute.
[35:28.06]We got a mutation here.
[35:33.24]This one's bigger.
[35:34.24]This one's really big.
[35:35.78]Why the fuck did it just die?
[35:42.83]Keep this one alive.
[35:44.77]How's it doing?
[35:45.57]Fatigue needs sleep.
[35:48.21]How you doing on temperature?
[35:54.61]Build a fence.
[35:57.62]Place a... Climate control.
[36:02.18]These can be used to heat, cool... Alright, fuck this.
[36:21.38]What's wrong with that fence?
[36:23.64]I need to keep one person alive.
[36:25.46]Okay.
[36:31.61]And a climate control device.
[36:34.97]Temperature.
[36:35.99]Target value of zero.
[36:38.49]In here.
[36:39.91]Create it.
[36:42.01]Alright.
[36:42.85]Now, fertility.
[36:44.95]Target value of...
[36:48.19]Um, I don't know.
[36:49.97]That's fine.
[36:50.57]Does this guy get an ecosystem in here?
[36:53.77]Now it's time for a germ or rumble.
[36:54.99]No, it's time for, like, I need one person to live.
[36:59.27]So I can turn them into... How are we ever going to make Spider-Man?
[37:03.05]That's never going to happen.
[37:06.61]This much pollution?
[37:08.23]Uh, three fertility.
[37:11.59]They're both fertility.
[37:14.34]Do I have to, like, change that?
[37:19.54]Are they both fertility now?
[37:23.40]Look at all this fucking pollution.
[37:24.60]Look.
[37:24.98]Okay.
[37:25.56]Look at it.
[37:25.80]Look at it.
[37:26.58]We got like a cookie monster here.
[37:27.60]Alright.
[37:28.40]Feed him.
[37:28.85]Feed him.
[37:29.09]How do I feed?
[37:29.49]Get off.
[37:29.95]Out.
[37:33.13]Come here.
[37:35.99]Alright.
[37:36.43]You're... You're in the fence.
[37:39.71]Good.
[37:41.62]We have two cookie monsters.
[37:43.02]Why are you dead?
[37:43.68]Why did you just eat him?
[37:45.88]The baby just ate the adult.
[37:47.44]The baby just ate the fucking adult.
[37:50.43]And now, I gotta keep these guys alive.
[37:53.75]More fertility.
[37:58.60]Why are you eating each other?
[37:59.52]I don't understand.
[38:00.10]Okay, now, let's go to genetic engineering.
[38:05.32]You eat him, and I'm fucking gonna throw you in the river.
[38:08.04]Don't even look at me like that.
[38:08.98]Did you just look?
[38:09.52]Did you know what you were doing?
[38:13.29]Needs oxygen.
[38:14.89]How do I increase the oxygen?
[38:20.16]Artificially inseminate the selected creature with save DNA from another creature.
[38:23.82]You got it.
[38:26.00]Don't crash.
[38:27.64]We're going with... Long neck?
[38:33.58]No, the one with legs.
[38:35.67]Target number to import.
[38:36.79]Ready?
[38:36.99]Did it work?
[38:55.56]I don't think it worked.
[38:57.22]Let's do times two speed.
[39:03.86]It's got legs.
[39:06.18]A species has split into two species.
[39:07.96]This happens nat- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:12.24]A species has split into two species.
[39:13.62]This happens naturally when there are no longer any members of either population that can breed with members of the other.
[39:24.43]One of your wild species encompasses a lot of biodiversity.
[39:27.59]Being part of the same species doesn't necessarily mean two creatures are capable of breeding.
[39:32.00]Rather, it means that they are connected by a chain creature that can.
[39:36.76]When creatures at either end of the chain are genetically incompatible, the species is known as a ring species.
[39:44.95]Okay.
[39:46.43]Well, I didn't do that, though.
[39:48.29]I gave him legs, and I gave him a tail instead.
[39:52.31]I need to increase the fertility here.
[39:53.53]They're dying.
[40:00.48]Target value of... Oh my god, we used... Why are you doing this?
[40:06.92]Uh... 10.
[40:12.37]What?
[40:12.95]No.
[40:13.23]What?
[40:14.99]Temperature.
[40:15.59]No.
[40:15.95]Of 10.
[40:16.35]Fertility.
[40:16.95]That's good.
[40:17.59]Whatever.
[40:18.05]What?
[40:19.35]I'm so confused.
[40:24.30]Let him out.
[40:24.66]Let him out.
[40:24.96]Okay.
[40:25.40]Okay.
[40:25.66]We got a first mutation.
[40:26.96]What's going on over here?
[40:33.31]no one has evolved they just cut green that's all that happened because they've been eating too much grass what a mutation this is the equivalent of when you eat too many carrots it's just a bunch of fucking mouse turds all right how do I go from mouse turd to spider-man
[41:01.18]No?
[41:01.44]Okay, I'm gonna- I'm gonna release them.
[41:03.02]You ready?
[41:06.88]They're free.
[41:08.50]Go.
[41:10.18]Keep an eye on this one.
[41:17.83]This one's got legs!
[41:18.49]This one's got legs!
[41:19.13]Feed this one!
[41:21.89]He's cold!
[41:22.31]They're cold!
[41:22.89]They're cold!
[41:23.19]They're cold!
[41:23.73]They're a little cold!
[41:27.07]I'm gonna sneeze.
[41:28.61]I fucking couldn't get it, whatever.
[41:31.16]Where is he?
[41:31.50]Where is he?
[41:31.74]Where is he?
[41:32.22]Oh, this one's got a neck!
[41:35.12]Okay, we're starting to get necks.
[41:37.14]A species has lo- Hold on.
[41:42.24]A species has been lost forever.
[41:44.52]Extinction is a fact of life.
[41:45.82]In the long term, only a very small percentage of species will survive.
[41:49.50]Even for those lucky few, survival is often a pyrrhic victory.
[41:54.60]The chances that their descendants will even resemble them are slim at best.
[42:04.16]What species was eradicated?
[42:09.60]We need to keep the ones alive that are... not the... okay.
[42:11.86]The ones that are eating each other.
[42:14.86]Here's a good leg curve with the frog right here.
[42:19.36]God damn it.
[42:20.10]That's why you need to keep them in a pen!
[42:22.17]Because you can't control what's going on!
[42:26.21]I need an overview here.
[42:27.33]Hold on.
[42:29.77]Give me like a... give me like a fucking... a chart.
[42:39.20]head scale genetics no species what about over what about over here yeah these are all part of the same species hi what are they doing over here are they developing into something else no because I haven't been with them over there all right where the hell where am I
[43:06.45]No idea.
[43:10.37]Where the fuck was I?
[43:12.95]Can I, like, quick go to this person?
[43:19.26]Here it is.
[43:19.50]Alright, what about the nursery?
[43:22.08]I need to, like, fucking... What, what we got?
[43:23.86]We got a new, uh, color scheme here?
[43:25.80]Ooh, alright.
[43:27.33]Alright, genetic engineering.
[43:30.65]Let's... I need to make something.
[43:39.60]We get the watermelon creature.
[43:43.22]Let's go with... Let's go with torso.
[43:46.02]Hold on.
[43:50.02]Torso.
[43:54.35]Chest height.
[44:03.21]I need to start making people with legs.
[44:06.05]Otherwise they're going to keep going like this forever.
[44:16.58]Okay, the head has to be higher.
[44:18.17]There we go.
[44:23.91]We're going to make like a praying mantis.
[44:26.81]The head needs to change.
[44:27.79]Do we have a neck?
[44:33.99]Hold on.
[44:40.35]It's got like claws, stingers.
[44:44.09]Alright.
[44:44.91]Limb step size.
[44:46.95]That's how big it is.
[44:49.48]Limb 11.
[44:50.08]Okay, limb type.
[44:50.92]Let's see.
[44:54.72]Oh, shit.
[44:55.20]Okay.
[44:56.20]Hold on.
[44:59.36]Here we go.
[44:59.68]There we go.
[45:00.74]I'm gonna name this one the Boxer.
[45:07.43]Limb length.
[45:08.37]No, no, no.
[45:10.27]Wrong, wrong, wrong.
[45:10.87]It's this one.
[45:25.44]Too much, too much, too much.
[45:34.70]I'm having a Silent Hill monster.
[45:36.57]Um... We need some, like, shoes.
[45:38.77]I don't even know which one this is.
[45:48.25]Oh, God.
[45:48.81]Okay.
[45:51.77]Limp Tip.
[45:52.43]Here we go.
[45:53.63]Needs to have shoes.
[46:02.27]Barbecue shoes?
[46:06.05]Limb tip.
[46:08.36]I need to get a different limb tip.
[46:18.12]Hooves.
[46:18.66]Oh yeah, for sure.
[46:21.41]I gotta get rid of the... This looks awful.
[46:23.81]Limb... What's it?
[46:24.39]Limb 21?
[46:24.51]Limb 21's gotta go.
[46:25.11]That's better.
[46:33.65]Alright, so this is gonna be called... We just need to... We gotta throw some weird shit in here.
[46:38.68]We gotta get this going.
[46:40.66]Generate.
[46:41.84]This one's gonna be called... Uh... I... Okay, where is my shoes of rocket?
[47:02.97]Right here, right?
[47:05.87]So we're in the nursery.
[47:07.59]So let's go to the nursery.
[47:10.98]And we're gonna apply this.
[47:13.78]Select target.
[47:15.60]Target is shoes of rocket.
[47:18.80]Import.
[47:21.96]Okay.
[47:23.76]There it is.
[47:24.14]Let's see if it happens.
[47:26.49]Applied radiation.
[47:27.61]Apply like fucking three times radiation.
[47:32.13]Okay, that's good.
[47:34.54]Is it dead?
[47:36.54]Is that one dead?
[47:37.64]That one's dead.
[47:42.85]Is it?
[47:43.09]Are these... Okay, why are they just exploding?
[47:52.07]Where's my Sims meter?
[47:57.19]They're suffocating.
[48:00.70]Get some oxygen in here!
[48:03.59]How do I get oxygen inside of here?
[48:06.67]What the fuck are the rovers even doing?
[48:09.64]Where's my rovers?
[48:11.66]Feed creatures with high size.
[48:14.18]Feed.
[48:14.54]It's all feed.
[48:16.80]They're feeding them.
[48:19.16]They're not killing them.
[48:19.78]They're not supposed to be.
[48:22.10]Feed the trees.
[48:26.38]How do I get more trees?
[48:41.16]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[48:42.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:42.64]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[48:43.44]Freeze time.
[48:46.50]Nursery.
[48:47.72]Got it.
[48:48.16]Right there.
[48:48.72]Get the radiation down.
[48:50.20]Target is selected.
[48:51.84]Go for it.
[48:52.58]You need to survive.
[48:57.68]This one's coming out.
[48:58.36]Come on.
[48:59.40]What the fuck?
[49:02.64]What is happening?
[49:03.92]Why do you keep blowing up into...
[49:07.97]They come out and explode!
[49:09.65]I didn't give them explosion.
[49:10.93]Okay, they got feet though.
[49:15.85]They do have feet.
[49:17.08]Need oxygen.
[49:17.96]How the fuck do I get oxygen in here?
[49:20.46]How do I get more trees in here?
[49:26.34]Alright, I'm getting you out of here.
[49:32.06]Need more fertility.
[49:44.50]You guys alright?
[49:45.12]Everybody like... No, he's just dying.
[49:59.37]They keep coming out and they keep fucking instantly dying.
[50:03.11]Cold, bask in sun, walk to location.
[50:09.51]Feed the trees.
[50:13.63]Look at all these trees have maximum energy.
[50:17.85]There's like plenty of trees in here.
[50:19.15]Look at all the energy they have.
[50:23.56]Max energy, max energy, max energy.
[50:25.90]Alright, I'm getting you out of here.
[50:36.99]Time to get to the real world.
[50:41.99]Oxygen, oxygen.
[50:42.85]We need more fertility.
[50:48.32]Is it too cold?
[50:51.44]He's drowning himself in water.
[50:53.70]No, stop drowning.
[50:54.90]Why are you drowning yourself?
[50:56.81]Get out of there!
[50:59.29]No, why?
[51:00.07]What are you doing?
[51:01.19]Why are you doing that?
[51:12.80]out of the simulation.
[51:16.36]I took him out.
[51:17.58]Instantly, just instantly goes into the water to die.
[51:24.37]Oxygen, seeking oxygen.
[51:28.05]What am I missing here?
[51:29.51]Hold on, genetics, energy, excess pregnancy.
[51:40.11]Okay, diet is an omnivore.
[51:42.89]lukewarm blooded optimal temperature is 24 it's aerobic okay I've yet to have a meaningful evolution except for I this they're just that's why they explode when they have babies is that what it is are they having are they getting too pregnant
[52:17.37]I'm just gonna ultra fast forward.
[52:18.57]Uh oh.
[52:31.85]Sorry about that lag.
[52:33.05]It's apologizing for the lag.
[52:37.93]Yeah, it's very CPU intensive.
[52:39.35]Do we have anybody else that's like mutating correctly?
[52:47.10]I need to put a species cap.
[52:52.12]I think it was on the default.
[52:53.66]Okay, should I make like a new world and... Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[52:58.06]This is gonna take like 40 in-game days.
[53:00.98]To get what I want.
[53:05.55]There are just too... Yeah, there are too many rabid shits.
[53:09.15]This thing doesn't even have a head.
[53:10.31]Oh yeah, it does.
[53:18.57]Okay, hold on.
[53:18.98]Somebody's gotta set all the mutation settings in the world creation menu to maximum if you want actual results.
[53:25.10]Oh, okay.
[53:26.84]Well, that was a fun, interesting, like, how does this game work?
[53:30.40]Let's try it again.
[53:33.25]Number of creatures.
[53:35.27]Uh, let's go with like a hundred?
[53:37.99]Fifty.
[53:40.05]What's the maximum that I should have?
[53:41.27]Fifty?
[53:41.59]Okay, mutation rate.
[53:50.91]What is the maximum?
[53:52.45]This mutation rate is high enough to completely obscure the effects of natural selection.
[53:55.51]Offspring may not resemble the parents at all.
[54:00.19]Three.
[54:05.48]God damn it, it's like being at the gas station.
[54:14.22]Got it, okay.
[54:15.92]A high mutation resulted in a lot of genetic drift?
[54:17.88]Okay, breeding range.
[54:20.64]The maximum genetic distance a creature can be from another creature while still allowing them to mate.
[54:26.85]Put this a little higher then, right?
[54:28.61]Like 40?
[54:29.95]50?
[54:37.79]Automatic population control is on.
[54:40.58]Okay.
[54:46.00]Anyone can just mate with anyone, right.
[54:48.80]Tree growth rate.
[54:52.23]Yeah, I want more of these fucking things.
[54:55.35]Forest density.
[54:56.15]A little bit more density.
[54:58.65]Temperature sensitivity.
[55:01.84]Fertility sensitivity.
[55:07.28]Speed multiplier, this is fine.
[55:08.54]Damn, aging rate is one.
[55:10.26]Temperature loss.
[55:12.08]I think these are fine.
[55:14.18]So we got much better... Temperature noise map.
[55:19.46]Temperature average...
[55:22.84]It's that fertility average.
[55:24.98]Should I make this higher?
[55:25.66]Yeah, I got like way more vegetation and shit.
[55:35.77]Lower the creature cap even more.
[55:37.73]To what, like 20?
[55:39.65]25?
[55:39.67]What if they die?
[55:51.14]You're making an ice world?
[56:01.57]Max efficiency.
[56:02.41]I think this is okay.
[56:04.47]Oh, okay.
[56:05.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[56:05.93]I see what you're saying.
[56:07.57]Creature cap is at 3,200.
[56:09.69]Yeah.
[56:15.06]That's a lot.
[56:16.70]How about, like, 100? 200?
[56:23.02]100 How many starting creatures are on the map let's go with like 10 And let's have like 500 or a lot World size that's fine get 10 starting creatures.
[56:40.86]I'm ready to get my chip together This looks good all right turn off the tutorial messages.
[56:49.05]I don't think I need them anymore max fertility
[57:01.72]350.
[57:05.48]Starting creatures.
[57:07.82]Ooh.
[57:10.51]We have a choice here.
[57:11.89]Predator and prey, aquatic, random, or blank.
[57:18.47]Is it going to be random shit?
[57:20.32]Oh my god!
[57:30.56]I mean, do I really want to work with random?
[57:35.77]Not yet.
[57:36.33]Not yet.
[57:36.67]Let me just try doing it with, like, me really trying.
[57:41.63]That's gonna make fucking all kinds of fucked up characters.
[57:45.13]We'll do that later.
[57:47.63]I need to try to make my own creature.
[57:52.26]So, what was the last thing?
[57:54.78]Breeding range.
[57:55.44]Lower it a little bit.
[57:57.48]To, like, what? 20?
[58:02.83]God damn it.
[58:03.17]Whatever.
[58:03.81]$19.99 is what you pay in, like, the Steam store for 80% of all the games anyways.
[58:06.87]Alright, let's go.
[58:07.33]You ready?
[58:08.97]Hire a mutation.
[58:12.04]We'll get there gradually.
[58:14.14]Here we go.
[58:18.80]So where are this ten?
[58:21.44]Here they are.
[58:25.96]Already, they're like, already, already dying in the ocean.
[58:31.84]I got three.
[58:33.80]Where are the other ones?
[58:38.72]Did they spawn in a random place?
[58:40.48]Fuck them, who cares.
[58:41.68]We'll have... Here we go.
[58:44.72]Seeking oxygen.
[58:46.88]Well, get out of the fucking water then.
[58:48.64]You can feed them all like that.
[58:56.12]Where are the other ones?
[59:02.01]Is there...
[59:05.70]Alright, found one.
[59:07.12]Get over here.
[59:14.29]Okay, we got sleeping.
[59:16.15]It's a little too hot.
[59:17.37]Wants to go swimming.
[59:18.85]Wants to go swimming.
[59:21.11]Oh, they're getting bigger.
[59:21.85]What about the ones over here?
[59:23.39]All of you get, like, in the same spot.
[59:24.93]There's too many of you already.
[59:30.12]They're already breeding in extreme levels.
[59:39.18]temperature up a little where are they going all right so let's try let's get some of you oh it's because the fertility rate they're just going to overpopulate this immediately
[60:07.18]Just let them do whatever they're gonna do?
[60:12.29]Seeking oxygen, seeking oxygen, seeking oxygen.
[60:16.59]They've already ruined the earth here.
[60:24.10]It's just a virus.
[60:24.90]Alright, get in here.
[60:28.82]Let's make some stuff happen in here.
[60:31.56]At least the tru- Alright, no, no, this is ridiculous.
[60:33.54]Hold on.
[60:34.00]I gotta do this one more time.
[60:34.98]New world.
[60:36.00]Fertility rate.
[60:38.70]Oh my god.
[60:47.90]I picked that slug up, put it in the den, and 15 babies came up.
[60:56.45]No, this is- Wait, this is fertility of the land, isn't it?
[61:04.95]Variation.
[61:05.65]Let's keep it at 1.
[61:09.38]This is vegetation.
[61:13.80]Breeding range.
[61:15.84]Ecosystem modifiers.
[61:18.82]World size creature detail.
[61:20.22]0.05 will not work.
[61:26.81]Mutation rate up.
[61:31.22]Oh, they can make it so they have to be sexual to reproduce.
[61:35.12]So they're reproducing just on their own.
[61:36.54]Okay.
[61:39.70]So they're self-reproducing.
[61:52.53]So now we have 10.
[61:54.73]They have to mate to do anything at all.
[62:00.85]This is gonna keep the numbers low.
[62:03.35]We brought the fertility down.
[62:06.15]Tree efficiency can stay on.
[62:10.62]Mutation rate is good.
[62:16.04]Alright, let's try it again.
[62:18.76]Good luck.
[62:24.01]They have to have sex.
[62:28.73]I'm looking for one.
[62:29.71]I have ten here.
[62:30.91]I should just have two.
[62:33.63]Where are they?
[62:37.31]Okay, they're... This one's eating.
[62:41.01]Alright, that's good.
[62:45.40]What's wrong with you?
[62:47.80]Armor-ness?
[62:49.12]Armor-ness.
[62:50.84]What does armor-ness mean?
[62:54.76]Cold, basking in the sun.
[62:56.02]Hmm.
[63:01.87]Okay, the tropical rainforest.
[63:08.51]Looking for others.
[63:11.70]There are others.
[63:14.36]But where are they?
[63:15.04]There they are.
[63:20.86]How are you guys doing over here?
[63:25.09]Okay.
[63:27.77]Somebody already had sex?
[63:32.55]No, don't do that.
[63:35.37]Okay, so you exploded and out came... No, no, don't just... Well, you are having a lot of children over here.
[63:54.20]Much more than over here.
[63:55.32]Alright, let's try to make something happen.
[64:00.60]We could just watch...
[64:07.13]No, let's get... Let's get somebody... I'm... Come here.
[64:10.23]You.
[64:12.35]Get inside of the nursery, wherever the hell it is.
[64:15.67]Come here.
[64:17.81]Get over here.
[64:20.18]You.
[64:21.24]Genetic engineering.
[64:27.12]I'm gonna make something.
[64:27.98]We're gonna have it be a target.
[64:33.12]Make it bigger.
[64:35.60]Like, maybe like a three.
[64:42.07]Five, maybe?
[64:43.73]Let's make it a different color.
[64:48.73]That didn't really work, okay.
[64:50.01]What about, no, that's not doing anything.
[64:54.05]Whoa!
[64:55.12]Okay, we're gonna have like a caterpillar.
[64:56.90]Caterpillar fuzz, that looks good.
[65:07.12]Optimal temperature is like fucking one.
[65:15.11]Torso.
[65:18.86]Chest height.
[65:19.46]Alright, now I'm gonna get- I'm gonna make something.
[65:24.98]I'm gonna make Stingray.
[65:35.47]Or a broom.
[65:44.45]No, I'm not... That doesn't look right.
[65:47.39]Stomach... I gotta make it wider.
[65:50.98]It's disgusting.
[65:52.06]It's not done.
[65:58.24]It's grotesque.
[65:59.08]Well, it's part of the evolutionary process.
[66:02.77]Length of pregnancy.
[66:04.39]That's fine.
[66:05.59]Litter size.
[66:06.83]That's fine.
[66:10.21]Positive values are carnivoys.
[66:12.53]It's gonna eat things.
[66:14.67]Torso rotation.
[66:17.25]Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[66:18.31]Okay.
[66:20.35]Hip height, stomach width.
[66:22.91]Limbs.
[66:23.29]Alright.
[66:32.83]I gotta change those.
[66:37.41]Looks good.
[66:39.48]Limb Ending type.
[66:47.14]What's the thing from Half-Life?
[66:48.30]I'm gonna make those things from the... The... Oh, greetings to you!
[66:54.58]The guys that do magic powers.
[67:02.00]The Vortigaunts?
[67:04.26]Yeah.
[67:05.00]I'm gonna make the Half-Life 2 magic power monsters.
[67:10.95]Okay, this would be a little thicker.
[67:17.72]Triceps are a little bigger.
[67:19.22]Biceps are a little bigger.
[67:20.28]Alright, Lim 11.
[67:23.82]Let's go.
[67:24.20]Why is it Lim 11?
[67:25.52]It's a weird name for it.
[67:34.42]I changed my mind.
[67:34.92]I'm going to make General Grievous now.
[67:53.26]Which one was more grievous?
[67:54.32]28?
[68:00.44]No.
[68:00.58]That looks... No.
[68:04.78]It's like an elephant.
[68:07.00]The first one I had was pretty grievous.
[68:11.12]That's kind of grievous.
[68:15.54]Make it a little longer.
[68:24.41]Okay.
[68:25.41]It's gonna be more upright, though.
[68:29.09]Rotation.
[68:31.56]Where's the rotation there?
[68:32.82]Torso, right?
[68:36.22]Torso, rotation.
[68:38.80]Oops.
[68:40.76]Okay.
[68:43.19]Uh, that's- this is the legs now.
[68:44.79]Yeah, this is the forest giant boss.
[69:12.39]Check this out.
[69:17.39]Watch this.
[69:23.54]Oh, no, never mind.
[69:25.02]Shit.
[69:29.71]How do I get back to... I need to rotate these.
[69:33.49]I need to rotate these.
[69:48.39]Please stop.
[69:50.39]Burn the computer.
[69:52.76]Just wait, hold on.
[69:58.92]Holy fuck, that looks horrible.
[70:02.28]Ugh!
[70:03.28]Alright, I like that.
[70:04.68]That's not bad.
[70:06.36]Neck.
[70:08.16]Has a neck.
[70:11.03]Neck length.
[70:16.41]Where's this neck?
[70:19.00]Do you guys see a neck here?
[70:26.78]Uh... Oh, this is the limbs.
[70:35.49]Oh, it's fucking with me.
[70:40.23]I clicked on neck.
[70:45.53]Neck.
[70:46.05]Okay, there we go.
[70:50.97]Neck length.
[70:54.21]Has neck.
[70:54.93]I think it's just one.
[70:55.75]Yeah.
[70:56.85]Okay, I need to make the thickness of the neck bigger.
[71:01.88]Stop making it do that!
[71:09.04]Okay.
[71:09.90]Neck slope.
[71:12.66]Oh, you guys are going to hate this.
[71:19.42]It's just one of those snakes, the firework snakes.
[71:27.45]Bring it down.
[71:36.63]Even more, even more, even more.
[71:37.75]Okay, so it's like that.
[71:39.39]Good.
[71:44.96]It uses his neck as another limb.
[71:49.99]Looks good.
[71:50.63]Head.
[71:53.19]Head scale.
[72:00.67]You can just make a giant ball.
[72:04.37]Head type.
[72:08.08]I feel like there are actual bugs and shit in the world that look like this.
[72:11.76]That one's horrifying.
[72:12.58]Look at the eye.
[72:12.94]That's eyes and mouth.
[72:14.08]Yep.
[72:21.33]Pretty great dead space character you got here.
[72:23.83]Brain.
[72:26.51]Let's see.
[72:28.09]Sex drive.
[72:31.83]Climate sensitivity, no, you're fine.
[72:34.14]Empathy.
[72:37.40]Reduces the chance, yeah, like give it some empathy here.
[72:39.62]Risk taking.
[72:41.20]High risk, high reward food sources, okay.
[72:44.86]Laziness, aggression.
[72:50.50]No, it's not a coward.
[72:51.48]It's not that aggressive.
[72:52.72]It's not that lazy.
[72:54.02]It's not that gluttonous.
[72:56.50]Okay, number of features, facial features.
[72:58.52]We got a couple here, right?
[73:00.38]Let's go with two.
[73:02.69]Feature one.
[73:07.21]Which one is it, though?
[73:12.23]Feature... What is it looking at here?
[73:13.98]Feature size, feature type two.
[73:15.76]I think it's just not big enough.
[73:21.79]Holy shit.
[73:22.53]Okay, it's got a giant hat on.
[73:27.56]Okay, well, it's wearing a shell on its head.
[73:34.28]Make it very aggressive and very lazy.
[73:46.19]Why is it all these weird shells?
[73:49.57]Does it get a birthday hat on?
[73:54.57]Alright, it's gonna wear a birthday hat.
[74:01.77]Okay.
[74:02.93]Face, that's good.
[74:04.21]I think this is a good start.
[74:09.56]It'll mutate into something else.
[74:10.98]Generate.
[74:14.78]Did it work?
[74:23.48]I can't tell.
[74:32.18]That's never going to successfully exist.
[74:38.39]Did that not do anything?
[74:42.07]Hold on.
[74:47.45]I don't get it.
[74:48.99]We're in the nursery, right?
[74:50.64]There it is.
[74:51.26]Okay, so it's going from here... It's trying!
[74:54.76]It's looking like it's trying.
[74:55.92]It's going to make this weird crab birthday monster.
[74:59.40]Okay.
[75:03.49]Go back.
[75:07.11]So the question is... I need to... No, get out of here.
[75:11.96]Can I, like, feed?
[75:12.76]Alright, hold on, we got another mutation going on?
[75:22.62]The drones are killing the ones that are not genetically similar.
[75:25.44]That seems kind of unfair.
[75:31.52]I just want the crab birthday monster to come up.
[75:33.56]Alright.
[75:34.74]Nope.
[75:38.99]It's just killing them if it's not correct!
[75:51.78]It's just browsing.
[75:52.66]Alright, I'm gonna... Turn off the royalty-free YouTube tutorial music.
[76:05.20]That's not my decision.
[76:07.52]Like, come on.
[76:08.18]Somebody grow.
[76:08.94]Alright, well, you keep doing that.
[76:11.10]While I go check out the other people in the wild here.
[76:14.78]How are they doing?
[76:19.82]Is everybody even alive?
[76:27.60]Okay.
[76:27.84]How are we doing?
[76:32.82]We have a couple of changes, it looks like.
[76:38.55]They've started to change color and have little tails and little legs.
[76:46.59]The population's getting too high.
[76:51.85]Can I please get a mutation going?
[76:58.27]Nuke the island.
[77:03.56]Come on!
[77:05.60]Somebody evolve!
[77:14.48]Sleep.
[77:14.88]Seeking oxygen.
[77:15.89]Eating.
[77:16.65]Corpse.
[77:19.71]Premium species has gone extinct.
[77:21.99]Has gone extinct.
[77:22.97]They've gone extinct.
[77:24.62]Premium Egesium has gone extinct.
[77:28.68]Lucarius specimen has mutated.
[77:38.87]Oh, the drone's killing the ones that are mutating.
[77:41.09]Let me just take... I don't have any.
[77:42.85]I don't think they are.
[77:44.15]I think they're, like, controlling the population.
[77:53.30]Evolve, dammit.
[77:54.82]Evolve!
[78:08.42]The one of you will evolve!
[78:09.78]I have a better idea.
[78:28.08]Okay.
[78:39.92]Rude.
[78:42.10]What do you mean rude?
[78:57.13]What the fuck?
[79:01.27]The web of life.
[79:11.24]Where the fuck are these people?
[79:12.39]What?
[79:15.17]How did you guys do all this without me?
[79:21.39]Hold on a minute.
[79:21.95]They're like progressing.
[79:24.80]They got hands, they got mouths, they have weird little eyes.
[79:35.00]Feed them.
[79:35.54]Feed them all.
[79:39.52]So, hold on.
[79:40.82]I can see where it's gonna go.
[79:42.20]What about these weird ones?
[79:44.70]What's this one?
[79:45.16]Where are you?
[79:48.93]Oh, shit.
[79:49.39]There you are.
[79:49.77]They're just, like, skating around.
[79:53.79]Oh, no!
[79:58.77]It wants to go swimming.
[80:00.89]It's gonna die.
[80:03.35]Well, it's extinct.
[80:06.57]Don't feed them.
[80:09.68]So where does that web end up?
[80:13.06]Go down here.
[80:13.98]We've got major species partially player-owned.
[80:18.08]Minor species... Alright, you're still going.
[80:23.00]My controlled environment's not doing well.
[80:32.09]Cold.
[80:32.95]Alright, let's kick up the temperature.
[80:37.67]That's so cool, though.
[80:40.97]What the fuck is that?
[80:43.55]Where is that?
[80:44.01]Alright, right there.
[80:49.83]It's rapidly exhausted.
[80:51.09]It's a hairy arm.
[80:59.20]It's a thing from Ah!
[81:00.30]Real Monsters.
[81:02.66]Apply radiation.
[81:05.26]Oh god, okay.
[81:08.97]What the hell?
[81:11.90]Alright, I'm gonna do radiation.
[81:15.18]Times, like, 2.3.
[81:15.94]This dopey fuck.
[81:23.17]Look at how much fun this one's having!
[81:30.45]They swim upside down.
[81:31.79]I love this one.
[81:33.51]I hope this one never dies.
[81:43.59]Where are you going?
[81:46.03]It wants to walk to location, over here, to like hang out by the tree.
[81:53.22]And now it wants to go swimming again.
[81:58.03]Looks like a tongue.
[81:59.95]Yeah, it does.
[82:00.41]Alright, hold on, we got more species shit going on.
[82:02.85]Look, look at this one, look at this one.
[82:04.41]You just gotta let it happen, right?
[82:06.99]Oh, God.
[82:08.27]This is extinct.
[82:09.61]This is... Okay, like the brown rabbit turd is now extinct.
[82:12.87]So that's kind of good.
[82:14.97]Here we are.
[82:15.39]Any others?
[82:21.48]Yep, we got plenty over here.
[82:22.54]Oh, that one's coming up.
[82:29.38]So how am I gonna introduce mine into the world?
[82:36.20]My stupid tripod monster.
[82:39.42]Have you still not evolved yet?
[82:43.80]You asshole!
[82:46.62]Hurry up and evolve!
[82:47.38]Alright, we need to make it a little warmer.
[83:00.05]Turn off the drones.
[83:01.17]I can't.
[83:02.33]I don't have any, like, that are here.
[83:05.10]Unless I can, like, turn them off in the nursery.
[83:06.78]I think they just do their thing, right?
[83:14.99]Increase radiation.
[83:18.81]These ones are not... Why?
[83:19.97]Come on.
[83:20.51]How come they get, like, cool ones and I don't get cool ones?
[83:24.28]Oh, shit.
[83:24.54]They're burning.
[83:24.94]They're burning.
[83:25.26]They're burning.
[83:25.84]They're burning.
[83:26.18]They're burning.
[83:26.56]They're burning.
[83:26.94]They're burning.
[83:27.62]Oh, fuck.
[83:27.88]The whole place is burning.
[83:30.10]This one just evolved!
[83:33.99]This is involved into like a- like a crusty booger.
[83:39.68]It's- Turn it down.
[83:40.82]Temperature down.
[83:41.36]Down.
[83:41.66]Down.
[83:42.78]No, stop it!
[83:43.62]Down.
[83:53.05]Oh, for the love of God, I'm fucking torturing everybody.
[84:01.27]It was fine.
[84:02.01]Well, the stupid dumb ones in the nursery were like, it's cold.
[84:10.78]So I literally started killing everyone on earth to appease like six people in the nursery.
[84:18.92]All right, we're down to 20.
[84:20.77]Everyone's fine now.
[84:24.81]40 degrees Celsius, 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
[84:27.63]Yeah, I know, but I was appeasing.
[84:30.30]You know what?
[84:30.58]Why don't I just fucking put you in here?
[84:32.32]Here, give me the cow.
[84:33.18]God damn it.
[84:42.75]Speed this up.
[84:54.68]Go on.
[84:56.46]No!
[84:56.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[84:59.88]I hate this thing.
[85:01.92]And now it's extinct.
[85:07.23]And we still haven't evolved at all.
[85:10.39]This control group doesn't have any water.
[85:15.37]How?
[85:17.01]Should I like put a fertility box in here?
[85:20.72]Or like an oxygen box?
[85:26.26]These guys haven't done anything.
[85:28.93]They're killing the ones that are not mutations.
[85:36.23]Get a drone to kill the drones.
[85:42.08]I have to raise the radiation in the nursery again.
[85:44.40]Oh god, is that gonna be bad?
[86:00.69]Come on, give me the fun music.
[86:04.25]Get them out of the nursery.
[86:05.37]Alright, I'm gonna take, like... I'm gonna take this one.
[86:09.34]And put it out of the nursery.
[86:10.94]This is the control group over here.
[86:17.52]Right here.
[86:18.90]Come on out.
[86:19.26]Alright, this is the control group.
[86:24.16]It's been radiated.
[86:30.57]This is like patient zero right here.
[86:37.29]Uh-oh.
[86:39.64]Are we going to infect everybody now?
[86:40.82]You just died in the water.
[86:41.98]Well, a couple of kids just went out into the open.
[86:47.24]Oh, boy.
[86:47.88]Here it begins.
[86:53.39]They're going to infect everybody now.
[86:56.19]There they are.
[87:04.14]How many more generations need to pass?
[87:07.85]So many texts.
[87:10.27]Yeah, somebody's blowing my phone up right now.
[87:17.67]We got some weird looking motherfuckers right now.
[87:19.37]Because lookit.
[87:20.39]That's what the target was, right?
[87:23.13]With the long arms in the front.
[87:25.13]What about over here?
[87:25.71]How's the nursery doing?
[87:29.89]No, you still haven't got it.
[87:33.53]Not ready yet.
[87:40.77]I wonder when they're going to start walking upright.
[87:42.57]That's what I'm waiting for.
[87:50.12]Nursery is killing all mutations.
[87:54.28]Why is it doing that?
[88:07.87]Fuck it.
[88:08.45]Let's introduce more.
[88:10.61]Get in there.
[88:11.97]Good luck.
[88:18.24]The nursery preserves a species.
[88:20.10]Alright, well, okay, but... If... Isn't this what it's supposed to be making?
[88:28.78]Ten creatures in nursery.
[88:30.33]Edit the target, right?
[88:31.35]The target is this.
[88:33.69]Isn't that the point?
[88:34.31]Okay.
[88:37.58]It's the purity zone.
[88:44.02]Nursery.
[88:45.26]This is not the nursery here.
[88:49.90]It will only spare the mutations.
[89:03.27]Just blast them.
[89:07.61]Well, I dropped some over here.
[89:09.21]I think we're going to start to see some interesting things now.
[89:14.15]They're starting to get legs.
[89:18.88]Do they fight?
[89:21.50]They're starting to turn into crabs.
[89:26.56]This one's doing like the handstand.
[89:29.61]Nice handstanding dog.
[89:44.54]Well, there we go.
[89:50.04]We're gonna follow this one.
[89:51.16]Herbivore is starving.
[89:57.72]Holy shit, what's going on over here?
[89:59.28]Is that where I am?
[89:59.93]Are these- are they friends?
[90:16.19]Yeah, it's an unpeeled potato.
[90:20.69]Hunger.
[90:21.17]Browsing.
[90:21.81]It's just browsing around.
[90:29.08]This one's fucked up too.
[90:32.76]Hot desert.
[90:33.98]How you doing?
[90:36.36]How much oxygen?
[90:37.34]Well, stop doing that!
[90:38.52]Get out of there!
[90:39.60]What's wrong with you?
[90:43.00]Why would you bury your head in the water for no reason?
[90:45.54]I need oxygen, might as well put my head in the water.
[90:47.50]I wanna see what comes out of this one.
[90:55.68]It's just basking in the sun.
[90:57.56]Oh, hold on.
[91:01.42]I don't know if he peed on him, or if this is him basking in the sun.
[91:10.15]I'm not entirely sure.
[91:13.82]Look at this guy!
[91:18.51]Hunger, scanning.
[91:20.97]He's gonna eat this one.
[91:29.95]They're gonna get so fucked up.
[91:32.64]Dude, this is my favorite.
[91:33.74]What's this one called?
[91:34.64]Primarius Animerk.
[91:41.76]Ooh!
[91:44.15]No, not as interesting as this guy.
[91:45.39]They're eating from the same tree.
[91:50.19]I'm gonna pull out here in a second.
[91:52.61]Bring him to a new island so he can take it over.
[91:57.56]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[91:58.32]Alright, uh, but how do you produce?
[92:03.18]Pause it here, I need to see this.
[92:06.46]This is Primarius Amorex.
[92:08.16]Statistic Physiology.
[92:09.59]Hold on.
[92:11.63]Averages.
[92:13.88]It's an herbivore.
[92:15.54]Does it need to have sex to survive, though?
[92:25.69]Well, I think we already got that.
[92:27.53]Alright, these two?
[92:28.87]No, we have to bring two together.
[92:33.59]Age 2,000 out of 70.
[92:35.13]Okay, well, it's capable of warm-blooded, optimal internal temperature.
[92:40.69]Hairy.
[92:44.80]It's a decent, it's a decent animal.
[92:47.79]Okay, let's go.
[92:48.67]Litter size 1.
[92:49.25]We're gonna get you to a secluded place.
[92:54.03]You can just, you can keep living your life for a minute, but... Who do we combine him with?
[93:03.09]I need to be the, okay, you need to, I need to be able to pay attention to you.
[93:05.39]Come with me.
[93:09.86]We need a secluded part.
[93:11.92]This is pretty secluded.
[93:15.05]Down here.
[93:18.79]Make sure you're fed.
[93:19.55]Just bask in the sun for a little bit.
[93:21.37]Alright, you're down there.
[93:22.13]Now who the hell do we combine you with?
[93:32.84]They're all binding of Isaac faces.
[93:34.72]It's like I just walked into the secret room.
[93:43.09]This one's kind of cool.
[93:47.47]Wish I could get a good look.
[93:51.24]Are you that green?
[93:53.04]Look at how green this is!
[94:00.96]Is this the mate?
[94:01.46]I think it's green.
[94:04.29]Yeah, green boy.
[94:19.32]Where the fuck did I put him?
[94:21.96]Over here, right?
[94:27.10]Right here.
[94:28.96]Alright, you two, you ready?
[94:31.40]Now play nice.
[94:49.96]You doing good?
[94:50.58]A little bit uncomfortable, but it's okay.
[94:54.93]Now you go over here.
[95:02.69]Stop resting!
[95:03.57]Come here.
[95:06.79]Come over and like, enjoy this person that's on the island with you.
[95:11.43]They'll figure it out.
[95:13.81]It's not the same species.
[95:16.21]So with the... It's too cold for them.
[95:20.21]Alright, come on.
[95:26.59]Scanning... They're just eating.
[95:29.55]They aren't the same species.
[95:30.65]They won't reproduce.
[95:33.12]Well... Fuck.
[95:41.40]What about one of these weirdos?
[95:44.82]Okay, so this is Primarius Anemic.
[95:48.97]Is this an Anemic?
[95:52.79]Taurorus Anemic.
[95:58.91]I need to... Okay, so that... No, wait, wait, wait.
[96:00.33]Hold on.
[96:00.49]That was a Primaurus.
[96:04.84]So this one can be blended.
[96:08.26]So I need a Primaurus.
[96:10.54]This one's fucked up.
[96:14.84]Alright, what about you?
[96:15.62]Content.
[96:16.54]Basking in the sun.
[96:21.10]Don't breathe this.
[96:22.34]What do you mean, don't breathe this?
[96:23.34]Come here.
[96:29.64]Okay, you guys are the same species.
[96:32.69]You should be good friends.
[96:37.57]Going to take a swim in the water.
