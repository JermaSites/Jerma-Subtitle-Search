[00:01.58]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.81]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:08.91]Let's do this.
[00:09.45]Alright.
[00:10.99]So, uh, no, no Mini-Sentry?
[00:13.75]Oh shit.
[00:14.09]No Mini-Sentry.
[00:15.47]Okay.
[00:16.33]Yeah, no Mini-Sentry this time.
[00:17.97]Okay.
[00:18.65]Alright, what color are we?
[00:19.79]Same colors, right?
[00:20.97]I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna go.
[00:21.79]You're gonna start digging up?
[00:23.56]Yeah.
[00:26.00]That's mine.
[00:27.16]That's my, that's the beginning of the hole.
[00:31.36]Why is Shibby always in good spots?
[00:32.92]Look at him being down in the hole over there.
[00:35.38]That's not necessarily that good.
[00:37.50]Oh yeah, get a native.
[00:39.64]You're done.
[00:41.01]You're done.
[00:43.65]No Mini-Sentry, huh?
[00:45.83]Nice, Shibby.
[00:46.43]It's going to be hard to get put in the water this time.
[00:52.73]Yeah, you're going to have to make a hole down the bottom.
[00:55.02]Whoa, what was that with that backflip?
[00:59.12]That's not going to work.
[01:00.06]Left shift.
[01:01.50]That's not going to work.
[01:03.90]It's going to hurt you more than it hurts me.
[01:07.06]Wow.
[01:11.74]Okay.
[01:12.14]Just keeping you guys honest.
[01:13.14]Alright.
[01:14.77]Alright.
[01:15.33]Alright.
[01:15.71]Say, Doctor.
[01:17.19]Burgah Boy, I hate to do this to you.
[01:18.43]Because you know you're one of my best friends and all, but... Burger.
[01:22.37]Oh, wait.
[01:22.97]You can sue me, too.
[01:24.25]Oh, you can sue me, and I didn't know this.
[01:26.65]Yeah.
[01:29.00]What you got for him?
[01:29.92]He's waving.
[01:30.42]Burgah Boy's having a great time.
[01:32.37]Oh, are you going to whack him in the face with a fish?
[01:35.85]I'm going to whack you in the face.
[01:38.19]Burgah Boy.
[01:39.01]Oh, you missed!
[01:42.03]Are you kidding me?
[01:43.27]Are you kidding me?
[01:44.41]You are the worst at this game.
[01:46.07]You are the worst at this game.
[01:47.79]You get better at swinging a baseball bat, you prick.
[01:52.25]Burgah Boy's untouchable.
[01:54.29]Okay.
[01:54.83]I missed that.
[01:57.34]Stick up.
[01:57.82]What is this?
[01:59.71]I'm gonna try this.
[02:00.33]I don't know what this is.
[02:03.68]What?
[02:05.36]I don't know what this is.
[02:07.76]Maybe you steal coins from them, probably?
[02:09.84]I don't think anything happened right there.
[02:12.24]Oh, you steal items.
[02:12.94]An item has been stolen.
[02:15.54]A-ha!
[02:16.26]Yeah, that was it.
[02:17.68]I meant to do that.
[02:18.84]Alright, Burgah Boy's pissed!
[02:21.18]Oh, don't worry.
[02:22.00]I just missed you at deep, close range of the baseball bat.
[02:25.59]You don't have to get closer.
[02:26.73]What are you doing?
[02:27.29]Oh, look at the leaves swinging by.
[02:28.83]Alright.
[02:29.17]So pretty.
[02:29.83]Pretty.
[02:30.15]Batter up!
[02:31.37]Hope you missed, too.
[02:32.55]No, this'll be right on your dome.
[02:35.51]Ugh!
[02:36.31]How much damage is that?
[02:38.63]Should be 30.
[02:38.87]30, I think?
[02:39.27]Yeah, 30.
[02:42.45]30 damage.
[02:43.45]Get away from me.
[02:44.17]Oh, MLG Grandpa's going to be going for that.
[02:47.45]Alright, who have I got here?
[02:50.03]Stick up.
[02:53.24]Alright, we're going to do some action here.
[02:57.72]Oh.
[03:01.22]See, Jerma knows how to ninja hook.
[03:03.04]Yeah, what are you... Oh, yeah, he does.
[03:06.88]Oh.
[03:08.22]Oh, shit.
[03:10.71]Oh, look at that.
[03:11.61]That was fancy.
[03:16.57]Oh, eat it.
[03:19.09]What?
[03:20.29]What?
[03:21.81]Oh, that could have been way worse.
[03:23.19]I would have fell on that flaming barrel.
[03:25.99]That was a pretty good round right there, I'm not going to lie.
[03:28.62]I really thought I was going to fall.
[03:33.06]What do I have for you, fellas?
[03:35.06]A little bit of a cluster situation.
[03:37.56]What if I just...
[03:39.83]Let's hope you don't miss.
[03:41.82]Shut up.
[03:42.64]I'm just gonna go full force to the back of the wall and hopefully bounce back some guys.
[03:47.76]Oh god, it just failed.
[03:48.74]What's going on here?
[03:50.06]Oh god.
[03:51.54]Here we go.

[06:41.78]That could have seriously been hurtful.
[06:44.36]I was trying to... Yeah, I was trying to get over there quickly.
[06:47.58]Alright, Orbeez.
[06:51.90]Oh, this would be a big nade if you drop that in there.

[07:25.40]Oh, God.
[07:26.52]Wow.
[07:28.07]Alright, interesting play by Orr.
[07:32.23]Alright, Burgah Boy.

[07:37.35]Oozy shotgun.
[07:38.79]Oh, God.
[07:43.15]Oh, fantastic.
[07:46.90]Awww.
[07:47.64]Goodbye, everybody!
[07:48.80]Hey!
[07:50.20]Shit!
[07:52.34]The survey says... Are these my only two guys?
[07:57.51]No, I got three.
[07:58.33]I got that guy on the right.
[07:59.97]Yeah.
[08:00.37]Jeremy, you're just... This is a bad time for you right now.
[08:03.59]Oh, no, it's not.
[08:04.57]It's a bad time.
[08:06.37]Why would you drop the dynamite?
[08:08.39]Why would you drop the... Alright, now, doctors, you're just... This is the... You're killing yourself here.
[08:12.39]Yeah.
[08:16.04]What a terrible move.
[08:18.64]Yeah, that was pretty bad.
[08:20.02]Oh, was it?
[08:21.48]What was it?
[08:24.03]I'll take the suicide kamikaze death machine.
[08:27.45]Wow.
[08:28.59]Wow.
[08:29.67]Now I can go out in style.
[08:33.53]Wow.
[08:35.95]Okay.
[08:36.39]Interesting play by Jerma.
[08:37.61]I don't know about that one.
[08:41.54]Okay.
[08:42.44]Let's see, I'll get away with it.
[08:44.92]Really?
[08:46.80]Because I can.
[08:48.77]I hope this just blows up at your feet.
[08:52.29]It probably will.
[08:54.81]How did that not hurt you?
[08:57.27]It hurt me.
[08:59.91]How did that not blow up the mine that's right there?
[09:05.17]It's a precision missile, Gerber.
[09:08.78]Ooh, I want that.
[09:10.22]No wait, it's gonna be J- No, it's gonna be Yermas' turn.
[09:12.94]He's gonna steal his box.
[09:15.38]I'm gonna get that box.
[09:17.50]This is ammo.
[09:18.22]Why do you need ammo?
[09:18.88]You need to, like, survive.
[09:21.62]Hey, you don't think I have a plan?
[09:23.99]Please, just miss.
[09:27.17]I don't know how you would miss that.
[09:29.57]I'm just making moves.
[09:32.65]That hurt a bit, not gonna lie.
[09:33.71]Alright, alright, you know.
[09:34.77]It was a safe play.
[09:37.31]What do you gotta do, Gemma?
[09:38.41]What are you gonna do?
[09:42.03]This is so risky, what are you doing?
[09:43.41]Are you trying to form an alliance with the shibby up there?
[09:45.77]I'm trying like, oh, I can't like, hold on.
[09:48.96]I'll settle it back.
[09:52.64]Oh shit, oh, this is the middle.
[09:55.70]Land right on that mine.
[09:57.93]Oh no, that would've been sweet.
[10:00.67]What?
[10:01.87]What?
[10:05.72]What?!
[10:06.20]What?!
[10:06.80]Wow, what a play.
[10:07.76]Is that a kill?
[10:09.42]I don't think so.
[10:36.01]22 damage.
[10:37.07]I'm still alive.
[10:38.21]Yeah, I'm dead next time.
[10:40.59]Shit.
[10:42.21]It's looking good.
[10:43.17]Looking pretty good here for blue team as you guys just annihilate each other.
[10:47.92]Wow.
[10:49.60]Alright, I gotta, do I have any ninja rope left?
[10:53.38]Because if I have a chance to still live, I have to get the hell out of here.
[10:57.85]If you hit this.
[10:59.29]If you hit this.
[11:02.74]Oh, no!
[11:04.30]So close.
[11:05.48]That was pretty damn close.
[11:08.48]Almost had the drop shot.
[11:09.58]Alright, Jerma, finish him.
[11:13.58]I'm so low on every treasure.
[11:15.34]Alright, here's your move, Jerma.
[11:16.46]Oh, a teleport.
[11:18.48]What a play.
[11:19.66]What a play.
[11:21.86]What a play, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:26.36]Have fun, guys.
[11:28.66]okay what is your health up 16 alright I'm still in this toss a grenade up there he's got a hundred health over there how do I got a toss to grenade all the way up there it's just go go over there to the right there's no way you land that no
[11:56.51]Look at this bitch.
[11:57.99]Taste of rain.
[11:58.85]That was way too hard.
[12:02.63]That should have been a cluster bomb, though.
[12:04.73]That would have been sweet.
[12:06.05]That was a pretty nice grenade toss.
[12:11.46]I played on the circuit, dude.
[12:12.88]I play competitive.
[12:15.02]I know what's up.
[12:16.86]I feel like I'm dead.
[12:18.74]I feel like I'm dead.
[12:20.72]Teleport up to Jerma and kill him.
[12:23.20]Hey, if you teleport up to me, I'm teleporting somewhere else.
[12:27.84]You only have one, I think.
[12:29.21]Oh, that's right.
[12:31.97]Please survive.
[12:32.43]Oh, you're toast.
[12:34.29]Oh, yeah, he's bone.
[12:36.71]God damn it.
[12:38.67]Gosh darn it.
[12:40.18]Gosh darn it.
[12:43.06]Well.
[12:45.20]What do I have here?
[12:46.96]If I would have been you, I know exactly what I would have done.
[12:51.35]I'm not going to tell you, man.
[12:52.19]I'm not going to spoil the tactics.
[12:54.28]What?
[12:54.88]Why?
[12:56.44]What are you going to do?
[13:00.80]Come on, get down there.
[13:02.18]Get down there, my little friend.
[13:04.98]Wow.
[13:06.04]I was trying to have him drop down from above.
[13:09.75]Now I'm going to shoot up a rocket and kill you.
[13:11.91]If you can be that good, then I will... No, there's no way.
[13:15.69]Oh, he's dead!
[13:19.37]What?
[13:20.23]What?
[13:23.03]I thought this would be a teleport, no?
[13:24.75]You have to, like, pick a spot on the map.
[13:28.07]But I don't see a cross or anything.
[13:31.49]You should be able to see it.
[13:33.50]I see nothing.
[13:35.30]Oh, too bad.
[13:36.12]Seven seconds.
[13:37.42]Journal lives for another day.
[13:38.70]God damn it.
[13:45.64]I didn't have a cross or anything.
[13:46.92]I didn't see.
[13:47.76]Really?
[13:48.57]Yeah.
[13:48.75]That's weird.
[13:49.73]I had nothing.
[13:52.29]I definitely don't.
[13:53.68]Go for Jerma, okay?
[13:54.68]Teleport up and kill Jerma.
[13:56.30]Okay.
[13:56.98]Hey, if you use a teleport, you waste a turn.
[13:59.48]Yeah, I see that.
[14:02.02]You get up to Jerma, okay?
[14:04.70]You're not gonna hit.
[14:05.32]Who's to say I won't like baseball bad boy?
[14:07.66]Skills!
[14:08.37]Sorry.
[14:08.57]You're done.
[14:12.49]You're garbage.
[14:13.57]Damn, talking some smack.
[14:15.01]Uh-huh.
[14:15.35]Okay.
[14:17.13]Let's see here.
[14:20.94]Go down and kill him.
[14:22.12]Gemma.
[14:23.56]That's not gonna work, though.
[14:25.54]It's not gonna work.
[14:28.98]I like the play.
[14:31.08]Oh my... What?
[14:32.68]Did that not hit you?
[14:34.22]Oh, that was awesome.
[14:35.06]That didn't do any damage?
[14:36.88]That was like a perfect grenade.
[14:39.04]What the hell just happened?
[14:40.14]Yeah, that was a perfect grenade.
[14:42.14]Oh man, screw that.
[14:53.02]Thank you.
