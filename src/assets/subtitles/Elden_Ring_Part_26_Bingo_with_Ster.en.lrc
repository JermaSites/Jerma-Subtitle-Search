[00:48.25]Can you give me mod in your chat?
[00:49.41]Do I have mod?
[00:50.01]Can I start banning people that are saying I'm quiet?
[00:52.29]No, nobody gets mod in my chat.
[00:53.99]That's restricted.

[01:30.49]So Volume 2, we have a whole... By the way, whole new game board.
[01:35.62]None of you... Like, nothing you've ever seen before.
[01:38.56]You want me to show the board?
[01:40.42]I haven't even seen the board yet.
[01:41.66]Hold on, I gotta get my... I'm not prepared.

[01:45.30]You're ahead.

[01:48.85]I'm pressing pause.
[01:49.81]Okay, pause.
[01:50.21]Pause.
[01:51.53]Which I prefer to call unplay.
[01:54.07]That's fine.
[01:55.28]I can sit here for a minute.
[01:56.36]I didn't even do an intro, so we're good.
[01:58.60]My audio isn't synced.
[02:01.14]Uh, I think you're lying.
[02:06.50]I think that's a lie.
[02:10.98]It could be, it could not be a lie.
[02:13.89]Hello.
[02:14.45]Hello.
[02:14.99]Hello.
[02:15.49]Hello.
[02:16.01]Hello.
[02:17.59]It is desynced.
[02:18.43]How does that even make any sense?
[02:20.93]Hello.
[02:22.27]One, two, three.
[02:23.54]No, it is not desynced at all.
[02:26.06]Sometimes it happens on Twitch now and they may have to refresh on their end.
[02:33.66]I thought he was bald.
[02:34.58]I'm going bald.
[02:35.72]Just wait another few years.
[02:40.20]Okay, I accepted that I was going to be bald five and a half years ago, so I'm fine.
[02:47.70]I don't even care like I know that I'm going to be bald in less than five years so I've already accepted it so I don't care however long this goes we're good have I gone on my rant with you about how great it would be to be old yeah we talked about this not really but I I could see this the sentiment well I think you would get it my chat doesn't get it I was saying when you're young
[03:13.24]Like, you know, young age up to teenager, your character build sucks.
[03:16.96]You don't know what you're doing.
[03:17.83]You don't understand anything.
[03:18.87]You're trying to figure shit out.
[03:20.51]And then you do like a whole middle-aged build and it's like, whatever, you're still trying to like get your life in order.
[03:24.77]And then I feel like once you get to be old person, your character class changes and you get a full respect and you can like, there is like new options.
[03:32.63]There are prestige classes available to you that you just never even had before.
[03:38.87]Like you can't be like creepy old circus guy when you're 21.
[03:46.74]Creepy old circus guy.
[03:49.71]You know what I'm saying?
[03:50.59]Creepy old circus guy?
[03:52.61]What do you mean circus guy?
[03:54.57]Like who has the hat and twirls it down?
[03:57.01]You like doing like circus dress ups, but you can't do creepy old guy yet.
[04:01.35]Circus guy.
[04:02.71]You're like fun.
[04:04.51]You're like Willy Wonka.
[04:05.97]Jump around.
[04:07.25]But you're not like, oh, welcome into my circus.
[04:10.19]You can't hold on a second.
[04:11.61]Do you remember the the the dancing old guy from Six Flags?
[04:16.56]What about what about that?
[04:18.96]Um, I mean, I think that just snapped your whole oh my god, I just almost knocked.
[04:23.22]No, that doesn't snap the argument.
[04:24.74]I'm just saying that these new characters are available.
[04:27.48]Okay.
[04:33.09]Okay, I agree.
[04:34.15]When you get to... But how old is that?
[04:36.75]Is it 70?
[04:38.13]Is it 60?
[04:38.95]What is this age bracket here that you're talking about?
[04:42.25]I don't think there's a set age.
[04:43.63]I think it is strictly based on appearances.
[04:48.83]So when you get a certain age and you... Okay, do you look like an old guy?
[04:53.85]Society needs to perceive you differently.
[04:56.10]So you need to be perceived as that guy's old.
[04:59.92]Yeah, you kind of need the...
[05:03.02]I don't know, like, like a rugged skin, disheveled, like graying.
[05:08.33]Okay, it doesn't have to be disheveled.
[05:09.67]I'm saying that's what I'm excited for, is that I get to be like a crunchy old guy.
[05:14.37]Maybe you don't want to be crunchy.
[05:16.55]Maybe you want to be the jump around six flags guy.
[05:18.89]Are you ready to get embarrassed for like the next three hours?
[05:21.10]I'm trying to set it up.
[05:24.66]I need to make sure bingo is in exactly the right spot.
[05:28.12]Okay.
[05:29.70]Can I show the board?
[05:32.06]Yes.
[05:32.66]Yes, I'm ready.
[05:33.20]I'm going to show the board.
[05:34.42]I'm going to show the board.
[05:35.87]Are you prepared to show the board?
[05:37.43]I'm prepared to show the board.
[05:39.19]Ladies and gentlemen.
[05:41.35]Board reveal.
[05:41.99]Where is your board reveal?
[05:44.89]Got some interesting things up there.
[05:49.18]I'll take the top row.
[05:50.32]Kill a death knight.
[05:52.88]Those are the DLC death knights down in the catacombs.
[05:55.92]Yes.
[05:56.16]I'm assuming.
[05:57.12]Those are the DLC death knights.
[05:59.76]Nature photographer.
[06:02.02]At least three birds as the subjects of a photo.
[06:05.40]Uh-huh.
[06:07.34]I have to admit, are we talking just screenshot again?
[06:11.00]Yeah, we're talking just like as long, okay, as long as you get them in the frame and you go like click, you just have to make a click sign.
[06:18.10]That's all you do.
[06:18.56]Okay, do you have to throw apples at them to get them to do anything?
[06:21.84]I mean, that's fine, yeah.
[06:25.53]Alright.
[06:27.89]Um, goadfroy, up to interpretation.
[06:32.36]Okay, I think I understand that.
[06:34.10]That makes sense to me.
[06:35.94]I get it.
[06:36.26]Okay.
[06:37.84]Kill a boss blindfolded.
[06:40.46]Again.
[06:40.70]A returning.
[06:43.80]It's classic.
[06:44.90]It should be on there.
[06:46.27]It's good.
[06:47.13]Quizmaster, pass the official Elden Ring quiz.
[06:51.75]Which we got a link there for our convenience.
[06:53.53]Yeah, the official Elden Ring quiz is actually very hard.
[06:58.29]It's not easy.
[07:02.20]Uh, melee kill a giant dragonfly, unarmed, barehanded.
[07:05.90]That is so qualified.
[07:08.26]It's unarmed, but I know there's unarmed attacks now, so it's barehanded.
[07:12.45]Is there a reason why you're reading the second row and not me?
[07:17.05]Okay, well, go ahead.
[07:18.15]I'm sorry.
[07:18.55]You start over.
[07:19.25]You read the first one.
[07:20.45]Melee kill a giant dragonfly, unarmed, barehanded.
[07:25.45]I think I did that a little better than you.
[07:30.39]Have a hostile mob kill another hostile mob.
[07:32.43]So an enemy has to kill another enemy.
[07:35.95]Doesn't matter how.
[07:37.11]You just can't be... You just... You know what?
[07:40.84]You shouldn't be able to do any damage to the mob at all.
[07:42.70]How do you feel about that?
[07:46.08]Okay.
[07:46.50]That's fine.
[07:47.20]Okay.
[07:49.08]Kill the Skadootree avatar.
[07:52.33]Challenging.
[07:53.11]Interesting.
[07:54.91]Watch Vaddy's latest video and give three facts.
[08:00.39]And then, uh, play two horns.
[08:03.32]Whatever.
[08:03.70]Play two horns.
[08:04.28]Whatever that could mean, right?
[08:06.22]Do flutes count?
[08:08.18]It's not a horn.
[08:10.24]Okay.
[08:10.76]Well, okay.
[08:11.28]Hold on.
[08:13.18]If you can blow into it and it goes, well, then you're good.
[08:20.27]Okay.
[08:23.01]Alright, I'm going to lose that one because I know you have like a closet behind you full of trumpets.
[08:27.02]It's just how long it'll take you to get out of the couch.
[08:29.18]So maybe I can go find some.
[08:33.22]The swear jar swore the least at 35 minutes.
[08:37.23]Do you want to make this an hour?
[08:41.01]You should ask the people that are the fact checkers if they want to count swears for an hour.
[08:46.93]What is that?
[08:47.55]What does the council think?
[08:53.99]Should the council, does the council want to decide should it be an hour?
[08:56.45]Should it be 40 minutes?
[08:57.39]I'm telling you, what happens if, okay, I'm going to be on my best behavior today.
[09:02.82]What happens if neither one of us says a swear?
[09:05.84]Is that possible?
[09:10.92]What happens if we both- I don't think I'm capable.
[09:13.66]You don't think so?
[09:14.18]I think I'll forget.
[09:16.06]And by the way, does this also include-
[09:20.41]Damn?
[09:21.83]Oh.
[09:22.17]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[09:23.75]We're on Twitch.
[09:25.91]Yeah, take that potty mouth over to kick if you want to start saying that.
[09:31.11]Okay.
[09:32.17]What about like crap?
[09:34.10]Oh, you're about to lose your sponsorship.
[09:36.64]Your partnership is gone.
[09:40.34]Stop.
[09:40.96]Stop.
[09:41.68]Alright.
[09:42.64]Where's your line?
[09:43.80]Is it damn it?
[09:45.14]Is it...
[09:46.59]Shit.
[09:47.51]This don't count, by the way.
[09:49.05]I'm winning right now.
[09:50.69]No, no, this doesn't count.
[09:51.33]We haven't even started the game.
[09:52.39]This doesn't count.
[09:53.07]Doesn't count.
[09:53.93]Everyone's saying no over here.
[09:54.79]No, no, no.
[09:55.33]It does not count.
[09:56.09]We have not started the game yet.
[09:57.33]Does not count yet.
[09:58.47]I don't, you know what?
[10:01.43]What if we just, you know, up to interpretation and we leave it to them?
[10:06.57]Okay.
[10:06.91]To the counters.
[10:08.87]Anything that you, okay, anything you wouldn't say in front of your grandmother?
[10:12.03]Would you say damn it in front of your grandmother?
[10:13.78]I wouldn't.
[10:18.48]Well, she's not going to hear it.
[10:20.04]Okay.
[10:21.32]There's no way I lose this, by the way.
[10:22.80]Like, I am going to be on my absolute best behavior.
[10:25.11]I'm not going to say a single bad word.
[10:26.95]Not a single one.
[10:28.83]Okay.
[10:29.35]Keep going.
[10:33.31]Bug collector.
[10:34.53]The most bugs in inventory at 30 minutes.
[10:37.70]We're stacking a lot of 30 minutes, you think?
[10:41.60]The last one was the squishies, an hour, and you want to bump this back to an hour?
[10:45.12]You want to do this to an hour?
[10:48.84]You know what I was trying to say.
[10:52.40]Yeah, because I want to get a lot of bugs.
[10:55.26]And I think based on our last one, where it took me two hours to go putrid night, we're going to be in there for a while.
[11:00.13]Okay.
[11:00.93]So let's make it an hour.
[11:01.81]At one hour, who has the most bugs in their inventory?
[11:05.11]There's a lot of bugs in Elden Ring.
[11:07.25]Plenty of them.
[11:08.57]Could be...
[11:10.41]I'm not going to say anything because I don't want to give you any hints.
[11:12.45]Could be Bugs Bunny.
[11:15.04]We made the middle space not given to Ster for free because he could play Binding of Isaac and I couldn't.
[11:22.10]Why couldn't you?
[11:23.38]My computer was fucked up and my controller was fucked up and my keys weren't pressing and my buttons weren't pressing and I had a headache on my fucking head hurt.
[11:30.74]Yeah, now that makes sense.
[11:31.78]Now this is kill a DLC Remembrance boss with no emotion.
[11:37.69]This is not a dungeon boss.
[11:38.67]This is a DLC remembrance boss.
[11:42.42]Good luck with that.
[11:43.50]And by the way, that means happy as well.
[11:45.84]You can't say anything.
[11:47.24]You can't be mad.
[11:48.10]You can't be excited.
[11:49.72]You have to sit there like this.
[11:52.82]And if you laugh too, you have fucked up.
[11:54.64]That's it.
[11:54.98]You might as well just... Well, I want to be clear on this one.
[11:58.70]Okay.
[11:59.46]Is this throughout the whole fight or like after the victory?
[12:04.61]No, this is when you traverse the boss door.
[12:09.21]You are no emotion until the bosses HP goes to zero.
[12:14.70]And at least two or three seconds have gone by after the bosses health goes to zero.
[12:19.50]And now that's content that this is traverse the door.
[12:23.38]No emotion.
[12:24.93]You last hit.
[12:28.25]You're good.
[12:28.49]Okay, now you can go for some motion.
[12:33.86]uh slay a wild hippo which is directly next to kill Messmer I know you could kill a hippo you could kill Messmer which one are you gonna do well that's a wild hippo that's not the golden hippo yeah no I know what you mean that's why it's even funnier to me
[12:54.84]Oh, you slay a hippo?
[12:56.16]Kill Messmer.
[12:56.90]Also, why is it not slay Messmer?
[12:58.72]This inconsistency is throwing me off.
[13:01.58]Because I don't know.
[13:02.44]Alright.
[13:03.68]Let's just be honest with you.
[13:05.50]Let's be honest with each other.
[13:07.26]Yeah.
[13:08.86]Neither one of us are going to.
[13:10.22]Neither one of us is doing this.
[13:11.58]Not neither one of us will do it.
[13:13.85]That's not going to happen.
[13:14.69]It just isn't happening.
[13:15.59]We put this on here to make like the Elden Ring kind of fans and Elden Ring players be like, you know, glance over and be like, are these fucking losers doing?
[13:22.75]Oh, okay.
[13:23.11]Messmer's on there.
[13:23.93]Okay.
[13:24.53]That's the only reason why it's on there.
[13:25.89]Oh.
[13:26.29]Yeah.
[13:27.75]I like the Messmer fight.
[13:29.42]It is just really far into the DLC compared to some of these other things.
[13:37.72]You could do it though.
[13:38.60]You could actually go for it and do it.
[13:40.78]mean hey man you know what you could do the next row uh I want to change this one and I know you don't want to but like I okay make a tuber rage face thumbnail in front in front of Malenia's boss door after getting Malenia to phase two at least it's okay it says at least three times how about just if you get Malenia to phase two
[14:05.56]after phase two you have you you that you take the thumbnail in front of the door and what I mean by thumbnail is you don't have to actually take a picture and make the thumbnail you just need to like get set to do you know like here it is like okay look what's behind me what like like okay oh I would prefer that you make a thumbnail and you you and it only constitutes as a thumbnail if you put a red arrow in it okay well do you want it to be actually make a thumbnail
[14:33.56]Because I'll just do it.
[14:34.60]Okay, that works for me.
[14:36.52]I'll just do it like baked into my OBS.
[14:39.62]That works for me.
[14:40.25]Yeah, that's fine.
[14:41.25]I mean, whatever the thumbnail of the video would really be.
[14:43.85]Alright.
[14:46.29]So then what constitutes a finished thumbnail?
[14:48.51]When you say I'm done, like this is my submission?
[14:51.29]When you're like, if you are just doing it on your stream and you're going to do a pose and you're going to set up your whole stream and you just say like, hey, this is it, guys, like screen cap this, that's fine.
[15:02.51]I okay I need to I need to I think I'm gonna be able to I'm gonna do it like on here well I I'm not going that way you don't know what I'm doing I know that you've done I know that on your stream you've spent an hour making a thumbnail for the video that was the thumbnail what
[15:24.09]One time, I swear, you just kept adding more and more stuff to the screen for it to be a thumbnail.
[15:30.05]Yeah.
[15:31.43]So there's a precedent being sent already.
[15:33.69]Yeah, you would do that.
[15:34.73]I see.
[15:36.00]Alright.
[15:36.46]Eat Grandma's stew.
[15:38.56]Grandma, the Grandam from... She's like, here, have my soup.
[15:42.82]You do have to beat Divine Beast for this to make any sense.
[15:47.14]So this effectively, you could say this is kill Divine Beast.
[15:50.66]Dancing Lion.
[15:52.79]Who knows?
[15:54.09]Make a Christmas tree out of rainbow stone arrows.
[15:58.72]So you need to make what is a passable Christmas tree with rainbow stone arrows.
[16:03.50]Visit five Mikolas crosses.
[16:06.82]And then kill any enemy with fall damage.
[16:13.52]Want to do the last one?
[16:15.24]Yeah, yeah, no, I was deep in thought, entranced.
[16:18.74]Least fall deaths at 40 minutes.
[16:20.80]We joked about this earlier, like when we were planning it, that neither of us were going to have fall deaths.
[16:27.19]Last run, I had like five.
[16:29.17]Yeah.
[16:30.93]I'm actually kind of terrified about this one because there's plenty of places to die from falling, even if you don't even mean to.
[16:36.55]Not like, oh, I fell off a cliff.
[16:38.55]There's tons of fall damage that I'm afraid of.
[16:41.11]And what happens if we're tied?
[16:43.75]Well, that's the thing.
[16:45.07]What happens if we're tied on any of these?
[16:48.21]Then OK, if that's the case, then.
[16:54.78]Maybe we just keep it there and the next person to die from a fall death loses.
[17:01.94]OK, unless it comes down to that being like a final one that matters, then we could figure something out.
[17:06.93]Then we could play like connect four.
[17:08.15]Yeah, because then that's falling into the correct place to block your opponent.
[17:13.39]Kill six enemies with one dance.
[17:18.29]That's a good one.
[17:18.99]You got the new dancing swords.
[17:20.79]Yeah, that's, I feel like, interesting.
[17:23.25]I don't know.
[17:24.61]I'm kind of concerned about that one.
[17:27.29]And I'll tell you why.
[17:28.27]Because... You can't dance.
[17:31.75]Well, not that you can't dance.
[17:35.03]My concern is that...
[17:37.17]That thing, I'm imagining I know what it is, and I know what it is.
[17:41.82]You came up with this so you know what this thing is anyways.
[17:45.62]This is going to be at level one.
[17:46.88]We're going to have to upgrade it.
[17:48.90]You could take it into the base game.
[17:51.58]You could, but yeah.
[17:54.20]Where there's a will, there's a way.
[17:55.48]I actually didn't think about what I would do.
[17:57.50]I just thought it was a fun one.
[17:58.66]Okay.
[18:00.46]You know, I don't have, like, oh, you want to talk about, like, getting the advantage on the other person putting Kill Putrid Knight when you know I can't Kill Putrid Knight on the list.
[18:09.12]Yeah, but I put on Get the Wandering Nobles to plus 10 and I ruined my own game, so.
[18:13.68]True.
[18:16.00]And then?
[18:16.40]True.
[18:17.16]What else?
[18:17.52]What do we have after that?
[18:19.32]Duplicate a Remembrance.
[18:22.40]So you got to kill them, get a Remembrance, you got to dupe it.
[18:26.74]Are we talking...
[18:29.23]No, we're not talking, uh, kill Fire Knight.
[18:33.29]Queeline twice.
[18:34.97]I hate dude.
[18:35.59]Why is this one on here?
[18:37.84]Why this is again?
[18:38.64]I told you I told you.
[18:42.58]I don't know who that is and I don't know where they are.
[18:45.50]You don't know who Queeline is and I don't know where I think I know where you fight them.
[18:49.76]Maybe one time.
[18:52.12]How did you not come across Queeline twice?
[18:57.20]Uh, I don't know.
[18:59.65]Okay.
[19:00.53]Well, you still have to beat him twice.
[19:02.59]I guess you don't know where that is.
[19:05.59]Did he play the DLC?
[19:07.33]I did.
[19:10.34]Write a haiku about your last boss encounter.
[19:13.64]That one's mine.
[19:15.14]And I want you to get that square.
[19:21.24]Do I, do I need to like, just pretend to be like, I don't know what, oh, I don't, I'm Jerma.
[19:25.60]I don't know.
[19:26.08]I'm Jerma.
[19:26.66]I don't know anything.
[19:27.94]What's a haiku?
[19:30.15]What is that?
[19:31.15]No, no.
[19:31.61]I want to, I want to see an expression of your inner soul.
[19:35.21]I want you to really take a moment to feel it.
[19:37.69]If you just go like, oh, I beat the boss.
[19:40.71]Like if you just start like printer machining out, it's not, it doesn't count.
[19:44.29]Okay.
[19:45.47]You need to really reach in your soul.
[19:47.43]575, right?
[19:47.99]We're talking syllables.
[19:50.59]And it needs to be about your last... Okay, so you have to kill a boss.
[19:54.84]Reflect.
[19:55.74]You need a moment to reflect.
[19:57.34]Whatever your last boss kill was, right?
[19:59.90]It could be... It doesn't necessarily need to be... Like, oh, you get bosses held to zero?
[20:06.40]That boss was very hard, right?
[20:08.48]It could even be Ludwig.
[20:12.04]What?
[20:14.86]Like, you're talking about your last boss.
[20:16.32]Like Ludwig from Bloodborne?
[20:20.02]Like, I've beaten Ludwig before?
[20:23.30]Why are you bringing up Ludwig?
[20:24.83]I'm talking about killing your boss.
[20:29.45]What are you talking about?
[20:30.55]Okay, never mind.
[20:31.95]It's over your head.
[20:34.15]No, it's plainly in view.
[20:36.21]I happen to like my boss, though, unfortunately for you.
[20:40.73]Okay.
[20:43.78]well that's the that's the bringo board he says he's not the dumb one oh it's so funny I'm telling you I'm telling you if I wasn't in this seat oh you think you're so funny I would get up there and I would I would come that oh my god I'm actually here
[21:07.79]what is the situation on our starting equipment same deal as last time you get five things that could be a sword that could be an axe that could be two axes that could be freaking I don't we're not we can swear still we have not started let's make that clear before I continue to say any other words I'm probably going to lose that square
[21:32.50]I think I will.
[21:33.60]Okay.
[21:34.16]I don't know.
[21:34.62]I'm interested in the results, I guess.
[21:36.56]That could be.
[21:38.54]Swords, axes, bows, we have everything you need right here.
[21:44.05]If you need something to crush someone's skull, or a helm to protect your own, we have everything here.
[21:50.42]What was your question?
[21:54.90]Uh, master works all.
[21:55.88]You can't go wrong.
[21:57.56]Mine was way more... Mine was so much more dated for the back, therefore I win.
[22:02.98]Okay.
[22:03.14]Which one is... Wait, what's yours from?
[22:09.75]I don't even know.
[22:10.39]I don't know that one.
[22:11.75]Baldur's Gate, Dark Alliance.
[22:16.95]Oh.
[22:19.11]Fake fan.
[22:20.31]Okay, so I would like to begin the festivities by simply saying good luck to you.
[22:29.15]We haven't begun.
[22:30.57]We are going to make our characters.
[22:32.83]I'm not going to make the same mistake I made last time, but yeah, you can pick.
[22:36.51]Talismans exist.
[22:37.67]You have to pick five items.
[22:39.21]Let's not joke and go over it.
[22:41.87]We're allowed to pick five items to start the game.
[22:45.43]that means any combination of five you could pick four talismans in one weapon you could pick two weapons one talisman and like two spells or something right we have access to all the spells we have access to all the incantations all the weapons every weapon is maxed out we're not going through that we just have maxed out weapons whatever we want
[23:06.14]That is what we are locking in.
[23:08.10]You can, during the course of your playthrough, if you find another weapon or you find an item, you absolutely can use it, go for it, but you still have to upgrade the gosh darn thing.
[23:17.93]That's all there is to it.
[23:20.54]I wish you the best.
[23:23.24]Let's have a good clean fight.
[23:25.30]Let's not pull any tricks.
[23:28.06]We need to be able to shake hands at the end of this and feel good about the result.
[23:33.29]I beat you last time and I'm going to beat you one more time.
[23:36.55]I mean, you probably will.
[23:37.27]You're the one that plays video games.
[23:39.01]I'm the one that fucking does the clown horn noises.
[23:41.15]You've played more Elden Ring than me.
[23:42.37]You've played more Elden Ring than me.
[23:43.49]You have played more Elden Ring than me.
[23:45.18]Okay.
[23:46.46]Okay, that does not mean anything.
[23:48.68]Just because I've played more Elden Ring than you, doesn't mean I'm a better video gamer than you.
[23:53.74]That's not how this works.
[23:56.70]You could... Okay.
[23:58.36]Like, what if... What's a... We're not doing this.
[24:00.98]We gotta go.
[24:01.48]We gotta go.
[24:01.88]I'm not gonna talk about... Wait, wait.
[24:02.88]I wanna know what you were gonna say.
[24:04.20]Okay, like, how do you... How is your, like, chef skills?
[24:07.98]Do you cook a lot?
[24:08.68]Oh, man.
[24:09.56]Oh, God.
[24:10.00]I have the perfect story from yesterday.
[24:12.50]I made, uh, so, like, white rice and some pork, and I let Ashley, my wife, have some, and she was like, oh, that was really good.
[24:20.86]And then she was like, I'm still hungry.
[24:21.98]Do you, like, I'm gonna make some more myself.
[24:24.14]Yeah, there's more pork.
[24:25.18]You can make more.
[24:26.20]And then hers was not as good, and she said it wasn't as good, and she said mine was more like it was from a restaurant.
[24:34.59]You think you're gonna be able to go up against my fucking baked salmon?
[24:38.27]Also, the pork today was undercooked intentionally so I can get worms while playing Elden Ring again.
[24:45.37]You think you can go up against my salmon?
[24:47.55]Your salmon is disgusting.
[24:48.91]I don't care how well you cook it.
[24:50.21]Dude, salmon is such a dog water food.
[24:53.03]You don't even have to cook it.
[24:54.85]You put that in a sushi.
[24:55.95]You just roll it up next to like seaweed.
[24:58.17]You'd be like, oh, check out my salmon.
[25:00.41]I did a great job on this.
[25:01.74]Yeah, somebody else got it from the ocean.
[25:03.78]Like a bear grabbed it as it came down the river and you're getting the credit for it.
[25:09.37]Have you ever thought about meditation?
[25:12.03]What about it?
[25:13.53]Instead of being so angry at how bad you perceive other people's food.
[25:20.75]How are you cooking your salmon?
[25:21.97]Tell me the dish.
[25:22.55]Tell me the full dish.
[25:23.27]It's a pan-seared salmon.
[25:24.71]It's not in the oven.
[25:25.39]I said that just to bait you to get that rage out of you.
[25:28.79]Wait a minute!
[25:30.09]You're the one trying to make me angry.
[25:32.25]Oh, you're a fucking idiot.
[25:33.39]Have you tried meditating on that?
[25:39.36]Okay, let me let me intentionally get this guy mad and then like tell him to meditate.
[25:44.96]Yeah.
[25:47.38]Oh, classic.
[25:50.84]Okay, so hand seared.
[25:53.28]Why are we doing this?
[25:54.24]We have a fucking game to play.
[25:55.46]It's been 25 minutes.
[25:57.16]This is important.
[25:58.16]You're going to act like this isn't part of the stream that is important.
[26:01.48]Hand seared salmon.
[26:03.66]Skin side down.
[26:04.74]I actually don't remember how to make it.
[26:06.54]I actually do it in the oven.
[26:10.62]I don't.
[26:11.32]I actually don't remember how to do it.
[26:14.12]Okay.
[26:15.68]Never go skin side down.
[26:20.97]What was the point in the beginning?
[26:22.67]I don't even remember.
[26:23.51]I really don't.
[26:24.67]I think there's a square on the bingo board that says cook the better salmon.
[26:29.46]That would be actually really funny.
[26:33.56]Okay.
[26:34.74]Somebody just said, I'm insufferable.
[26:36.74]Me or him?
[26:38.06]Which one are you talking about?
[26:39.06]Why are you here if you think that?
[26:40.42]If they said I'm insufferable, they were talking about themselves.
[26:43.62]And it was just a weird self-report.
[26:45.47]You're both insufferable.
[26:48.29]Okay.
[26:48.47]Let me tell you something.
[26:52.41]I'm ready to battle.
[26:54.96]Same.
[26:56.46]Are you ready to make your character?
[26:57.40]Yeah, let's mute.
[26:58.64]Pick your five things.
[27:00.06]I was doing my hairstyle while we were talking.
[27:03.10]Me too.
[27:03.91]I was trying to get it to look like slicked back.
[27:06.29]I'm doing like a murder face.
[27:14.57]Alright, see ya.
[27:19.61]Don't look at us?
[27:20.55]Why not don't look at us?
[27:22.33]I'm looking over here.
[27:24.20]Yeah, okay.
[27:25.18]You're in like three spots.
[27:26.96]You're here.
[27:28.06]This is chat.
[27:29.24]That's also chat, right?
[27:30.92]That's all your... What?
[27:32.12]Look, my hands look huge.
[27:36.06]Hey, you over there.
[27:40.17]I'm talking to you.
[27:42.45]Listen up.
[27:44.39]Okay.
[27:45.87]What am I playing as?
[27:47.13]That's a great question.
[27:53.64]I think this time I'm going strength and I think I'm going to use the giant fucking turkey leg.
[28:03.38]Is the turkey leg good?
[28:06.38]Like just the huge turkey leg.
[28:11.44]Is it OK?
[28:12.01]Is it really good or what?
[28:18.07]You should get five bug items.
[28:23.14]OK.
[28:24.60]So.
[28:26.34]What do I want to do?
[28:29.66]The hell?
[28:29.88]I don't want to do that.
[28:32.40]What do I want to do?
[28:35.78]Wait.
[28:36.94]Oh my God.
[28:39.37]I gotta like disable the mouse before we start.
[28:41.69]That's going to be a huge problem.
[28:42.71]I already know it.
[28:44.55]Alright.
[28:50.23]Five items.
[28:51.17]What is an item I want first?
[28:54.56]You know, Throwing Hammer might not be bad.
[28:59.07]What do we got for huge weapons here?
[29:02.17]Something like a Strength of Dex.
[29:03.57]Nothing fancy.
[29:04.47]No bullshit.
[29:09.17]Throwing Hammer is fun.
[29:12.52]Ster is shit-talking you.
[29:13.64]Mad shit-talking you.
[29:14.48]I wouldn't take that if I were you.
[29:17.42]I'll see him on the battlefield.
[29:22.86]Okay, Ster and I do have a gentleman's agreement that we're not going to do.
[29:27.17]What?
[29:27.87]You're swearing?
[29:28.45]We haven't started.
[29:28.95]Have we started?
[29:34.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[29:35.74]Have we started yet?
[29:36.44]Hey, hey, hey, council.
[29:39.28]Council.
[29:39.72]Have we started?
[29:42.96]Have we started?
[29:50.15]Because my chat is telling me that I can't say any bad words right now.
[30:03.00]They told me that.
[30:07.30]They over here, they told me.
[30:09.44]Okay.
[30:09.82]Once you say go.
[30:10.96]Got it.
[30:12.50]So we're not there yet.
[30:13.16]Okay.
[30:14.74]Important.
[30:15.83]Important.
[30:23.36]Do I just take the turkey leg?
[30:34.99]Where is it?
[30:37.91]Spiked club?
[30:39.19]Is this?
[30:39.67]No, this isn't it.
[30:40.39]This is the little one.
[30:43.61]Okay.
[30:45.18]Large club.
[30:46.36]Should I use the large club?
[30:52.00]I kind of feel like I want to take this.
[30:55.08]And just smush people.
[31:03.31]Oh, what about the curved gray club?
[31:14.15]Oh, what about the brick hammer?
[31:22.42]Alright, is the brick hammer?
[31:23.50]Is this a one hander or two hander?
[31:28.36]I think this is only a one hander.
[31:34.84]Let me let me just.
[31:37.20]Let me try it.
[31:37.70]Let me let me try it.
[31:38.34]Let me try it.
[31:38.68]Let me go somewhere where I can actually attack.
[31:51.67]Okay, it is just kind of like a big mallet.
[31:55.77]I'm into this.
[31:56.85]I think this is going to be one of them.
[32:04.04]That's pretty good.
[32:11.45]Take two of these?
[32:12.55]You think I should?
[32:13.27]No, no, no.
[32:18.66]It's super simple.
[32:19.78]It just gets the job done.
[32:20.92]I just want to hit.
[32:22.22]Dodge.
[32:23.34]Whack.
[32:24.76]I think I like it a lot.
[32:27.96]Do double.
[32:29.36]Do Giant-Crusher.
[32:30.12]I'm begging you.
[32:32.21]We did have a gentleman's agreement that we can't use crazy overpowered weapons.
[32:35.57]So.
[32:38.15]I kind of.
[32:39.75]Well, we don't have two of each thing though.
[32:47.58]Hmm.
[32:51.30]I think I'm going that.
[32:54.46]And I need to free up the talismans.
[32:56.96]What about the great club?
[32:57.80]Yeah, let me try great club.
[32:59.54]There's large club where... I could try this.
[33:08.76]Let me just mess around with them for a minute.
[33:20.15]OK, let's just take a look.
[33:23.87]OK, same move set.
[33:33.84]Can you throw this thing?
[33:37.32]OK, that's pretty cool.
[33:48.89]That's cool.
[33:55.39]What does it scale off mostly?
[33:59.59]OK, strengthen everything else weirdly.
[34:01.67]OK.
[34:08.62]Do both.
[34:47.49]Heavy infusion?
[34:52.44]Okay, wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything.
[34:55.10]The council is over here.
[34:56.58]You're over here.
[34:57.72]You're up there.
[34:58.62]Council's over here.
[35:00.02]Bingo board here.
[35:01.01]Like, I've got an entire space station around me, okay?
[35:05.21]Like, you're everywhere.
[35:07.99]Alright.
[35:08.67]I don't know if I want to take two weapons, though.
[35:11.01]I feel like I would be happiest.
[35:16.60]I'll take...
[35:22.71]Yeah, let me look at the talismans.
[35:30.88]Because the talismans is where I got... I didn't really have... What about Asher War too?
[35:37.24]Is there a better Asher War to put on this thing?
[35:39.16]Or no.
[35:41.24]Something heavy.
[35:43.46]Something that's like fun.
[35:47.23]Wait, wait.
[35:48.01]Let's focus though.
[35:49.25]Alright, talismans.
[35:53.69]Okay, I know I want the two-handed.
[35:56.59]I want this.
[35:58.04]This thing, I'm gonna always take this.
[36:02.46]That's one.
[36:06.48]Where's the, where is it?
[36:08.10]Can't you just get this really easily?
[36:10.33]I, I, no, no.
[36:13.69]You can get these, you can, can't you get this one easily?
[36:19.21]The two-handed?
[36:28.92]You have to kill Rolana for it.
[36:30.28]I'll just take it right off the bat then.
[36:32.76]Okay.
[36:34.57]So, what about... Maybe... Do you know where it is?
[36:44.91]I actually don't know where it is.
[36:48.19]Oh, we actually... We got another gentleman's agreement.
[36:50.47]We gotta... I gotta ask him this.
[36:56.02]Hey, Ster.
[36:57.04]Excuse me.
[36:59.41]Yeah?
[37:00.68]Um, I have a quick question about... Um... Shit, what was my question?
[37:06.56]God damn it.
[37:07.02]Path of Exile?
[37:08.38]No, no, no, no.
[37:09.18]What was it?
[37:09.54]What was it?
[37:09.88]I was gonna ask him something.
[37:10.60]What was I gonna ask him?
[37:12.62]Shit!
[37:13.10]I was too busy.
[37:13.68]I was looking at the fucking bingo board.
[37:15.76]What was it?
[37:19.69]I don't know what it was.
[37:20.63]Oh, right.
[37:20.93]Okay, wait.
[37:21.35]So, gentleman's agreement.
[37:23.11]Yeah.
[37:23.47]Do you... What was the... What the hell was I even just talking about?
[37:28.21]No, like what the hell?
[37:29.11]I don't know.
[37:29.96]I don't know.
[37:32.16]Gentlemen's agreement.
[37:33.80]Would you mind if we both... I got a space station here.
[37:37.28]You didn't even tell us.
[37:38.72]I didn't even tell my chat.
[37:39.58]I don't know.
[37:39.88]Never mind.
[37:41.16]Okay.
[37:41.42]Gentlemen's agreement.
[37:42.22]Talisman.
[37:42.92]Talisman?
[37:44.34]No, no.
[37:44.86]I'll get it.
[37:45.26]It'll come back to me.
[37:46.28]What if the swear jar was like physical chunks of your flesh?
[37:52.31]What the hell?
[37:52.83]Alright.
[37:54.85]I'm done.
[37:55.21]I'm ready.
[37:55.83]Oh.
[37:56.59]I'm not ready.
[37:57.15]I need another two minutes.
[38:00.87]Okay, no, you're good.
[38:02.17]What was I going to ask you?
[38:02.89]Just trying to remember that one thing you thought of a moment ago.
[38:06.59]I had it in my head and then I looked over here and then I saw somebody say something and then I looked over there and then I saw the council talking and then I saw the bingo board.
[38:14.16]What the hell was it?
[38:16.24]Yes.
[38:16.72]That is it.
[38:17.22]Okay.
[38:18.28]Ster.
[38:18.81]Gentleman's agreement.
[38:19.59]I have, I figured it out.
[38:21.37]Oh, Hey.
[38:23.85]Can your chat help you?
[38:25.65]Like, are you allowed to like take advice from chat?
[38:29.87]Yeah.
[38:30.41]Yes.
[38:30.91]Okay.
[38:31.85]Cause I was avoiding that last time.
[38:34.05]So we're, we're okay with looking over here and being like, Hey, where is this?
[38:36.94]Help me.
[38:38.14]Yes.
[38:39.08]Okay.
[38:39.92]Okay.
[38:40.10]So, so Alpers are allowed.
[38:45.04]Appreciate it.
[38:45.42]Thank you.
[38:46.52]Gentlemen's agreement.
[38:47.54]Yes.
[38:51.25]Cool.
[38:51.35]Alright, give me five minutes.
[38:54.65]OK, I got I gotta hurry up.
[38:59.73]Two handed weapon with the OK, there's yeah, there's a. Where is it?
[39:05.09]OK, I need helpers.
[39:10.14]You want the jar?
[39:11.48]I do.
[39:12.00]I think I want the jar talisman, right?
[39:16.18]or is it?
[39:21.31]No alpers.
[39:22.17]What are you talking about?
[39:23.01]Okay, but do I really want this?
[39:30.15]I got my Smithscript hammer.
[39:35.10]Smithscript talisman.
[39:36.24]Yeah, where is it?
[39:36.96]What does it look like?
[39:49.63]No, do this, not this.
[39:51.01]Do this.
[40:03.52]Yeah, well, I don't, I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[40:05.48]Okay, there it is.
[40:06.60]Enhances weapon throwing attacks.
[40:10.78]Cool.
[40:14.25]So that's three items.
[40:17.09]Now I have to think about how am I feeling about this.
[40:20.34]I have three- I have two more spots.
[40:23.54]I think I'm gonna take this.
[40:31.41]And then I'm gonna look at the ashes.
[40:34.77]This also is very easy to get.
[40:36.73]I don't remember.
[40:37.25]I think it's down when you jump down heading towards Santrino.
[40:43.37]Like down that area, I think.
[40:45.07]There's like a little cave you go in and it's in a cave system.
[40:52.12]Do enhanced charge attacks.
[40:54.56]I don't want to get completely married to that idea.
[40:57.72]Because what if I don't like it?
[41:01.64]Do the dragon crest.
[41:09.01]Yep.
[41:09.65]I'm always going to take this.
[41:10.47]Okay.
[41:11.11]I can take one more item.
[41:14.55]I have my Smithscript.
[41:21.60]And then take the health one.
[41:23.96]Crimson Seed.
[41:29.04]I could, but is that... No, no.
[41:30.42]I need a different Asher War.
[41:31.66]Because I can always throw this.
[41:35.44]So what do I want to put on this?
[41:37.97]Something cool.
[41:42.27]I don't want something that's try-hard, though.
[41:44.73]Something good, but not ultra try-hard.
[41:49.56]Will you lose the throw?
[41:50.40]I think the throw is just R2, not L2.
[41:59.24]Royal Knight's Resolve.
[42:03.92]What about Overhead Stance?
[42:15.29]What about Raging Beast?
[42:19.11]Royal Knight's Resolve is cool.
[42:21.95]Yeah, I don't know.
[42:22.81]I don't want to use this one.
[42:24.17]Royal Knight's Resolve.
[42:28.95]Where is it?
[42:42.13]Greatly powering up your next attack.
[42:44.97]Just one?
[42:47.28]Oh, you can't.
[42:51.60]Okay.
[42:53.06]It's alright, though.
[42:59.62]Ster already started?
[43:00.44]No, he didn't.
[43:03.26]I don't even think I care about the Ash of War.
[43:08.43]Wait, let's just see if it even works.
[43:13.20]Like, can I even do it?
[43:14.40]Because I don't think I have access to Beelda.
[43:28.63]Oh, we don't have the infusion for it.
[43:31.59]Oh, shit.
[43:39.74]Alright, alright.
[43:40.66]Well, we don't need that then.
[43:42.96]I'll do the butt slam.
[43:44.30]Yeah, butt slam it is.
[43:47.90]Butt slam it is.
[43:48.54]We're going for it.
[43:57.93]Where is it?
[44:07.61]Trolls roar.
[44:08.67]There it is.
[44:09.01]Okay, ground slam.
[44:12.46]I'll go for it.
[44:20.00]That's my one stupid dog shit item, okay?
[44:25.20]We've seen ground slam?
[44:26.66]You have?
[44:27.12]Did Ster do this last time?
[44:29.14]No, he didn't.
[44:39.56]It's boring.
[44:44.09]But it's fun though.
[44:52.09]Okay.
[44:52.31]It looks like your skin's being dragged behind you.
[44:57.84]Okay.
[45:00.60]You mean like the bug from Men in Black?
[45:05.06]Alright, I think I'm good.
[45:06.06]Let me just go over it again.
[45:09.46]I gotta put these away, but yes.
[45:12.36]Let's do my build.
[45:13.36]I need to do my build.
[45:16.83]Hold on.
[45:17.35]This thing's all the way up.
[45:20.59]Hello?
[45:21.57]God, that scared the shit out of me.
[45:24.49]Hello?
[45:27.47]I'm almost done.
[45:29.78]Quick tip.
[45:30.64]Sure.
[45:31.20]Pro tip.
[45:32.30]I gave us both the telescope and our inventory.
[45:35.58]You should put on a hot bar so you can zoom in on some birds.
[45:44.11]You know what I'm saying?
[45:46.41]Oh, I see what you mean.
[45:47.47]And is the D-pad forward to zoom in when you got the telescope?
[45:52.91]And you said it's in the... Hold on.
[45:57.65]It's in your inventory, not the stash.
[46:00.54]We already both had it, so I am letting you know.
[46:02.94]Because I want good bird pics.
[46:05.70]My chat was like, no, don't tell them.
[46:06.84]Don't tell them.
[46:07.57]I want good pics from you.
[46:09.05]Okay.
[46:09.59]Well, I want to see the whole bird.
[46:12.09]I might not even be going that way.
[46:13.35]You don't know.
[46:15.91]Okay.
[46:16.35]I am pretty much ready.
[46:17.67]I need... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:19.23]Are you routing right now?
[46:20.98]Are you spending this time routing?
[46:22.58]No.
[46:23.42]Ask my chat.
[46:23.94]I've been freaking out.
[46:26.84]Chat, has he been freaking out or is he routing?
[46:28.70]Does this guy have a whole plan?
[46:33.82]I need to respec, which is going to take me not very much time at all.
[46:37.41]Don't worry.
[46:37.83]Okay.
[46:40.23]I'm ready.
[46:42.23]Okay, so we're ready.
[46:43.19]Are you saying you're ready?
[46:47.11]Yeah.
[46:47.77]I'm not quite there.
[46:48.77]Give me one moment.
[46:50.75]Oh, because you're routing.
[46:52.49]I'm not doing any routing.
[46:53.63]I don't have any plan.
[46:54.69]I haven't even like considered that we're playing Elden Ring.
[46:57.70]I think we're doing something else.
[46:59.40]I'm explaining to my chat like my cool TikTok video idea.
[47:05.39]Alright, get out of here so I can talk to my chat about what I'm doing.
[47:08.64]Okay, I know you just forgot what you were talking about 30 seconds ago.
[47:11.72]No, trust me, I need help.
[47:13.90]I'll be back.
[47:15.14]Trust me, I need help.
[47:17.76]Okay, we're just doing every fucking point in strength.
[47:19.76]You know what I mean?
[47:20.20]I'm going 80 fucking points.
[47:21.46]80 points in strength.
[47:32.69]Okay, we're going 30 endurance.
[47:34.05]I don't need any mind.
[47:34.87]Who cares?
[47:37.11]30 endurance, 60 Veigar, and 7 at 80 strength.
[47:44.96]60 is the hard cap?
[47:45.84]I don't give a shit.
[47:51.20]Wait, a good idea is to see, what does this need?
[47:54.18]Actually, you can put it on.
[47:54.96]Okay, I need 10 decks.
[48:01.56]10 decks?

[48:33.48]You are a one-trick pony motherfucker, aren't you?
[48:35.56]This is the first time I've ever used a strength weapon on stream in the five FromSoftware games that I've played.
[48:48.39]Huh?
[48:53.98]We're going 40 endurance.
[48:55.78]I don't even give a shit we're doing this.
[49:06.95]60, 33, 75.
[49:07.66]Should I put points in dex?
[49:13.26]No, that's not doing shit.
[49:16.44]You need 11 dex?
[49:18.62]No, it was 11 in faith, 11 int.

[54:00.12]Let's do this right.
[54:01.70]I know this fragment here.
[54:02.68]There's a fragment here or here or here.
[54:08.60]I gotta be good about this.
[54:10.04]I can't fuck around.
[54:11.34]He cleaned up.
[54:16.09]Last game.
[54:26.34]If I see bugs, I'm picking them up too.
[54:37.28]Shit.
[54:44.87]No!
[54:45.57]I'm actually so mad at myself right now.
[55:02.18]Over here.
[55:02.74]Come on.
[55:03.12]I know that everyone's... I'm getting some fragments.
[55:06.45]So I can be ahead of the game.
[55:09.25]We're on a fragment collection.
[55:14.63]I thought he just killed me.
[55:23.98]Sturges farted into the lighter.
[55:25.80]Oh, no.
[55:27.40]Can't be.
[55:29.16]Okay.

[55:37.91]Oh, I'm getting.
[55:38.52]Come on, come on, come on, come on, hurry up.
[55:42.98]There's one there.
[55:43.56]There's one there.
[55:45.06]He's beating you.
[55:45.68]He hasn't done anything.
[55:49.58]He's probably freaking out as much as I am right now.
[55:51.14]He's I don't see any claims over there.
[55:52.50]OK, I know this one here here.
[55:58.27]I need the lantern too.
[56:08.63]How can I not see anything?
[56:12.11]What is going on with this view distance right now?
[56:21.48]Yep.
[56:21.70]Okay.
[56:22.04]This one here.
[56:23.08]And then I'm going to go.
[56:24.38]I'm going to go try to kill the death knight.
[56:29.62]I think I know exactly where it is.
[56:33.63]You notice how he mentioned that?
[56:40.67]I have to be good and I have to... I... He's like, oh, death knight?
[56:45.21]Death knight.
[56:45.51]He mentioned that.
[56:46.08]Okay.
[56:51.14]Now, where is it?
[56:53.08]I know there's a fragment here.
[56:54.18]I feel like there's a Grace here too.
[57:03.72]It's like along the edge.
[57:15.67]I wish I could see anything.
[57:18.75]Is it not right here?
[57:19.69]I thought there was a fragment over here.
[57:33.36]I'm wasting time.
[57:35.48]It's a painting, not a fragment.
[57:38.84]Ster just became the Elden Lord.
[57:40.87]Oh, no way, man.
[57:43.54]Where is it?
[57:44.17]I know there's a fragment right here.
[57:45.75]I swear this, whatever.
[57:50.78]Isn't it like along the coast?
[57:53.22]It's more west.
[57:54.46]It's too late.
[57:54.88]It's too late.
[57:55.55]I don't know.
[57:56.53]And I can't get it.
[57:59.52]If it wasn't literally blue.
[58:02.45]The whole screen is blue.
[58:04.55]My entire video game is blue.
[58:06.59]I don't think I've ever even seen it like this.
[58:08.91]I've never played the DLC and seen a blue fucking screen like this.
[58:12.17]Period.
[58:12.93]Ever.
[58:13.97]Ever.
[58:15.37]Ever.
[58:15.69]Have you ever seen the game like this?
[58:18.87]What?
[58:21.37]Alright, now I'm angry and I need to settle down.
[58:29.24]Okay, I've already fucked it up.
[58:30.80]Stop swearing.
[58:34.07]Isn't there a gr- Okay, I can see the game now.
[58:36.93]What?
[58:37.07]Are you kidding me?
[58:40.59]What was that?
[58:41.47]I couldn't- I couldn't see anything.
[58:43.53]Anything.
[58:44.13]Zero.
[58:44.51]Okay.
[58:54.33]Now that I can actually see, I'm going over there.
[58:57.43]I gotta move this.
[58:58.49]I hate it there.
[59:08.68]No, it's not.
[59:09.72]I know it's like a group.
[59:10.80]I remember it.
[59:21.20]I can't not get it now.
[59:22.55]I know it's like along this cliff.
[59:27.71]I'm losing my mind.
[59:29.85]Where is this?
[59:32.11]It has to be lower then.
[59:35.15]I need to pivot.
[59:36.34]Sunk cost, I know, I know, I know!
[59:38.64]Ugh!
[59:39.88]I can't play Bingo, I can't do it.
[59:41.96]I just, I get so obsessed with every little detail.
[59:44.10]Like, it's like 500 movies playing in my head at the same time.
[59:46.52]And all of them, I can't change the channel.
[59:48.21]Okay, let's go.
[59:54.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, there, there, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[59:58.43]There it is, there he is, there he is, got it.
[60:00.86]Go, go, go, out, out, out, out, out.
[60:08.31]Okay.
[60:09.89]Then there's one.
[60:10.80]I know how it works.
[60:21.43]Leave me alone.
[60:26.58]Okay, is that enough?
[60:27.52]Do you think I've had enough?
[60:29.70]I gotta go to the cross over here.
[60:31.92]Let's go up the road.
[60:39.54]Yeah, I know there's one at- there's two crosses here.
[60:41.84]Why do you look like a bald eagle today?
[60:46.48]Because that's my spirit animal.
[60:47.62]You figured it out.
[60:50.65]Ster got- Wait, Ster passed the quiz already?
[60:54.79]Wait, what?
[60:57.04]Ster past the quiz.
[60:59.08]He did the Elden Ring quiz?
[61:02.08]I gotta move now.
[61:07.30]No more daily dallying.
[61:08.40]I have to go now.
[61:09.60]And you all know what I have to do.
[61:10.64]I know exactly where I'm going.
[61:17.12]Do not stream hop.
[61:18.34]Time to lock in.
[61:34.23]Here.
[61:35.61]And then I think it's like here somewhere.
[61:39.11]Let's go.
[61:55.34]Alright, don't take unnecessary damage here.
[62:04.42]Dude, I might just go get Bernal's armor.
[62:12.30]I need a full armor set.
[62:25.96]Okay, good.
[62:34.33]Okay.
[62:38.27]You all know where I'm going.
[62:44.31]Okay.
[62:47.07]It's like up here.
[62:50.85]I'm almost certain that there's a death knight up here.
[62:56.62]You can tell he's annoyed when he touches his nose.
[63:05.56]What's my character's lore?
[63:09.58]Ah, hold that thought because I need to go now.
[63:13.58]I did this on stream.
[63:17.06]You should watch the Vaddy video.
[63:20.10]Actually, hold on.
[63:21.37]I need to...
[63:24.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:24.70]I'm not ready.
[63:25.44]I'm not ready.
[63:25.86]Not yet.
[63:26.38]Not yet.
[63:26.66]Not yet.
[63:26.94]Not yet.
[63:27.24]I'm going to play it at like times three speed.
[63:32.30]Is this the right way?
[63:32.88]This is definitely the right way.
[63:34.57]I remember specifically doing this on stream.
[63:41.07]Oh my God.
[63:41.49]Is this wrong?
[63:42.71]Oh, thank God.
[63:43.21]It's right.
[63:43.49]Okay.
[63:49.87]Batty's latest vid is 45 minutes long.
[63:54.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:56.04]Is this right?
[63:56.62]Where's the entrance?
[63:59.39]I need to calm down.
[64:00.27]I can never calm down when I do this.
[64:02.07]I need to go like smoke a bowl right now.
[64:06.30]It would probably help.
[64:42.11]Okay, an Elden Ring movie, Children of the Scarlet Rock.
[64:45.66]Okay, coming up.
[64:50.20]Oh my god, I'm dead!
[65:18.36]I can't pay attention to this.
[65:24.12]I can't hear anything he's saying.
[65:28.18]I can't hear anything.
[65:30.84]This is the epicenter of the blue, where Malenia once fought with Radahn.
[65:32.98]With the help of the dancer in blue, she had trained to resist the call of the Scarlet Rot.
[65:36.41]But in this fight, she was pushed to the brink and was forced to sacrifice her pride in order to win.
[65:39.91]She needed to kill Radahn and send on his soul, no matter the cost, so that the lion could become Miquella's consort.
[65:44.73]But Radahn was only weakened until we came to Caelid.
[65:47.53]To finish the job.
[65:48.05]Alright, so we came to Caelid to finish the job.
[65:54.83]When the tarnished arrives, it's been an age since Caelid was first decimated by the Scarlet Rot.
[65:59.24]And it's the worst at the center of Caelid, where Malenia once bloomed.
[66:03.60]Malenia once bloomed in the center of Caelid.
[66:06.02]An offshoot of Malenia's bloom rises.
[66:07.82]Millicent, a red phantom.
[66:09.66]Instinctively driven, perhaps, to- Whoa!
[66:26.87]Stop me fighting!
[66:28.76]What the fuck?
[66:29.66]Stop me attacking!
[66:53.18]I think a version of Millicent that we fight here is a projection of herself, and herself is currently plagued by the Scarlet Rock.
[66:59.26]Millicent is doing a projection in Caelid, and it's who the first invaders you fight is.
[67:09.78]Even the dress is a comment to the Scarlet Rod.
[67:12.12]The local wildlife runs rampant in unending war against Redan's stoic warriors, who stave off these rot-crazed beasts with fire, and the pale pests crawl through the land, abandon the children of the Scarlet Goddess.
[67:23.51]They possess a keen intellect, and have even managed to tame the local wildlife, as has the one who lives in this shack just outside the main town.
[67:37.80]Oh, a pleasure to see you.
[67:39.16]A pleasure indeed.
[67:40.50]I am a great savage.
[67:42.68]In my day, anyway.
[67:43.98]I'd hoped to ask a favor when one of your ilk came along.
[67:46.45]A strapping young tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aenia.
[67:50.81]Don't fret.
[67:51.57]I'll provide fine recompense.
[67:53.43]Should you accept, I will teach you the secret of Senia, the town you see there.
[67:59.45]Gowrie teaches you the secret of Celia.
[68:04.17]I need your help to heal a certain young girl.
[68:06.99]Her name is Millicent.
[68:09.26]You will find her beyond Celia, resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness.
[68:16.76]I thought that was in my game!
[68:32.35]The center of the swamp is defended by Commander O'Neil.
[68:43.12]It's hard to say who he once fought for, but even after his lord was fled, O'Neil continued to brandish his flag in the devastation of the rot-eaten field of battle.
[68:50.14]He was the sole veteran that remembered this battle with pride.
[68:55.71]Perhaps his ability to resist the Rot can be credited to a certain honorable need.
[68:59.60]For here, Commander O'Neil refuses to die, even amidst the Rot.
[69:04.05]Even though he has nothing more than the dead to command.
[69:07.21]At least, until you come along.
[69:20.42]This dungeon fucking sucks.
[69:23.24]You found the unalloyed gold needle.
[69:25.58]As promised, I've detailed the secret of Celia right here.
[69:29.74]Go on.
[69:30.76]It's yours.
[69:32.36]Now let me have a look at the needle.
[69:35.02]I have no armor.
[69:35.82]I have to beat him with no armor.
[69:37.76]Well, well, this is a Marvel indeed.
[69:39.72]The work of a true artisan.
[69:41.02]A meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life.
[69:44.17]Where's my mouse?
[69:44.67]Can you give me some time with this?
[69:46.09]Where's my mouse?
[69:46.67]As well made as it is, she won't be much much snapped in half, will it?
[69:51.47]Okay.
[69:53.11]This needle was made by a demigod.
[69:54.89]By Miquella, the unalloyed.
[69:56.29]Twin brother to Malenia.
[69:56.97]Miquella made the needle.
[69:59.39]Malenia's plight led Miquella to unalloyed gold.
[70:02.11]A substance that could resist the meddling of the outer gods.
[70:04.39]So it was that he created weaponry.
[70:06.00]Prosthetic limbs and needles that could lessen his sister's sorrow.
[70:09.10]But none of them cured his illness entirely.
[70:11.76]Indeed, Miquella's tragedy is his innocent intention.
[70:14.60]Full of hopes, yet never, it seems, to see things through to the end.
[70:19.69]I have awaited your return.
[70:21.61]The middle is repaired.
[70:23.25]Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure.
[70:26.35]Will you give it to the girl, Millicent?
[70:28.49]I will reward you in power.
[70:31.32]Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff beyond Selya, the town of Mordor.
[70:35.72]Tended to by the woodless pests who worship her, the rotting sickness is a god, a wretched fate indeed.
[70:42.26]The poor girl, she never wished for any of this.
[70:53.05]I'm going to finish the video later.
[71:01.37]I got this right now.
[71:02.72]Everybody chill.
[71:06.68]Do I have to watch the whole video?
[71:09.90]Or does it count if I don't want to?
[71:11.78]Thank God.
[71:12.24]Okay, here we go.
[71:14.45]Lock in.
[71:24.52]Thank you.
[71:55.02]I had no stamina!
[71:56.22]Shoot!
[71:57.84]I had no stamina.
[72:13.77]so so
[72:29.05]so so so so
[73:06.11]I forgot about that one.
[73:11.01]I forgot about that one.
[73:13.19]Let me try it one or two more times.
[73:18.06]He does the big, big spin.
[73:20.22]Okay.
[73:20.94]I think I got it.
[73:21.42]I think I got it.
[73:43.37]Thank you.
[74:03.51]so
[74:56.93]Dang.
[74:57.93]Dang it.
[75:01.23]I haven't seen this guy in a long time.
[75:02.81]I got it.
[75:03.61]I'll get it.
[75:06.45]Oh, man.
[75:07.01]That was close.
[75:10.19]Okay, I will definitely get this.
[75:12.13]It's just getting the timing on that combo.
[75:14.63]It's like one, two, and then he immediately does it again.
[75:17.57]Alright, let's go.
[75:21.43]That's a bad start.
[75:46.76]Weird!
[75:52.20]Weird!
[76:20.31]The wall was right behind me.
[76:29.11]I think I got to lock in and get this.
[76:31.36]Alright, lock in, lock in.
[76:36.90]This is it.
[76:37.32]I got him.
[76:45.27]I got crossed up.
[76:47.37]It's okay.
[77:24.80]Thank you.
[77:49.51]That's a lot of damage.
[78:16.11]so so
[78:45.27]Let's go.
[78:47.25]Sniped him.
[78:56.17]Sniped him.
[78:59.63]I gotta go to Millenia right now.
[79:07.63]I gotta get to Millenia.
[79:10.21]I gotta get to Millenia to do my thumbnail.
[79:24.16]Hold on right now.
[79:28.24]Okay.
[79:38.98]Haiku, haiku, okay.
[79:44.01]Okay, okay, okay.
[79:48.09]The night of death shines.
[80:01.29]The night of death shines.
[80:06.88]Underground here they perish.
[80:21.24]The night of death shines.
[80:23.56]Underground here they perish.
[80:32.64]Will the, will we ever, will there be any, will there be mercy?
[80:42.89]Done.
[80:48.05]Done.
[80:48.45]There it is.
[80:53.94]The night of death shines.
[80:55.86]Underground here they perish.
[80:58.46]Will there be mercy?
[81:07.17]That's a third square.
[81:10.91]That's a third square.
[81:16.49]Keep it going.
[81:16.91]I gotta get to Millenia right now.
[81:17.95]Okay.
[81:30.10]Okay.
[81:32.57]I am currently cooking.
[81:38.58]That looks good to me.
[81:39.48]Okay, Millenia.
[81:44.22]Let me turn this off.
[81:45.81]I gotta go make a YouTuber raid.
[81:47.37]I gotta get to Millenia phase two.
[81:49.57]Oh, that's gonna be fucking impossible.
[81:53.55]I hope he's swearing a lot.
[81:55.28]How do you even get to Millenia?
[82:05.52]I don't even remember how to get down here, but we're going to try.
[82:08.58]Alright, the Halleck tree enemies are actually really, really strong.
[82:25.13]Oh, my video, my video.
[82:27.51]Ask that I stab myself with the needle to quell the scarlet rot.
[82:31.03]But how?
[82:35.03]Never mind.
[82:36.29]I've decided I would rather trust you than simply continue to spoil from within.
[82:41.34]Would you mind averting your eyes a little?
[82:49.57]It feels like I'm watching something.
[82:52.21]Oh.
[82:52.39]I gotta.
[82:53.66]I. I will.
[82:55.42]This.
[82:56.90]I can't talk.
[82:57.66]There's too many things happening.
[82:59.08]I don't even know how to get to Malenia.
[83:04.00]I don't know how to get to Malenia.
[83:08.91]Spent three years!
[83:10.03]I didn't get anything.
[83:25.87]I'm considering leaving.
[83:27.89]On a journey with a needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly, my destiny.
[83:34.62]It's all thanks to you.
[83:36.13]My name is Millicent.
[83:37.37]I pray fate permits us meet again.
[83:39.75]Millicent is... Millicent lost her memories after...
[83:59.38]No, that's a... I don't need a shortcut right now.
[84:27.38]Oh, you noticed, did you?
[84:29.38]Indeed, Millicent did visit this hobgoblin home.
[84:32.24]It seems the memories... I feel like I'm catching up for a book report that's due tomorrow.
[84:36.22]However, she has no need of me anymore.
[84:37.84]No, no, no.
[84:38.36]It's due in an hour.
[84:39.52]...on her journey and still have fate in the eye.
[84:42.36]I mustn't impede.
[84:43.64]As I've aged, I've found the best way to make a young... Please be certain that little Millicent has her home.
[84:52.58]Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior...
[85:02.84]I vow to pass on my knowledge of the last sorcerers of the symbiotics descendants of the Eternals.
[85:08.61]It is, however, already something is very off with Garen.
[85:13.56]This is his tale.
[85:14.38]He teaches us the secret techniques, the way of essence.
[85:19.18]In the name of the peculiar, I choose to serve the Golem.
[85:30.03]But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.
[85:32.75]I doubt the tune was the first thing.
[85:33.98]But when I was getting older, I didn't always worry so much.
[85:41.04]So, Gowri is known as the foster girl.
[85:43.81]He's raising her in the image of Malenia.
[85:45.67]In the name of the beauty she represents.
[85:47.73]But beauty means something very important to him.
[85:59.12]I can't hear anything.
[86:00.08]This video is 45 minutes long.
[86:01.92]Oh my god, it's going to take an hour.
[86:03.00]Where am I?
[86:03.26]Okay, that's not that bad.
[86:03.99]I actually have flasks.
[86:23.26]It's 45 minutes long.
[86:29.02]I'll get back to it.
[86:29.52]Alright.
[86:35.14]I'll get it.
[86:35.44]I'll get it.
[86:35.68]I'll get it.
[86:37.38]Is this take the shortcut?
[86:39.35]I don't know.
[86:39.69]I don't have time for that right now.
[86:41.37]There's no reason why I should die too, Loretta.
[86:48.46]Take the shortcut for real though.
[86:51.54]Is that actually wait?
[86:52.20]It is right here.
[86:52.60]You're right.
[86:52.86]You're right.
[86:53.30]You're right.
[86:53.56]You're right.
[86:53.82]You're right.
[86:54.22]You're right.
[86:54.72]You're right.
[86:55.06]You're right.
[86:55.34]I'll do it.
[86:56.20]Good call.
[86:57.18]Good call.
[87:02.60]Pause what you're doing.
[87:04.36]Pause what you're doing.
[87:06.04]Everybody stop.
[87:08.36]Everybody stop.
[87:09.44]I'm paused.
[87:09.84]I'm paused.
[87:10.22]I'm not doing it.
[87:10.82]Stop the count.
[87:12.80]Me there.
[87:14.30]It is swear jar time.
[87:15.66]Oh, it's time for the swear jar.
[87:17.70]It is swear jar time.
[87:19.26]We get a count.
[87:21.04]How many?
[87:23.18]How many?
[87:24.17]I definitely lost this one.
[87:25.39]It's unfortunate.
[87:28.79]It's unfortunate?
[87:29.87]There's nothing anyone could do to prevent it.
[87:32.15]I cannot believe.
[87:33.29]How many times did I swear?
[87:34.07]It was at least a few.
[87:35.87]At least.
[87:36.82]You beat me.
[87:37.78]What do you mean I beat you?
[87:38.94]You beat me.
[87:39.30]You did apparently...
[87:41.82]The tally says Jerma 6, Ster 8.
[87:47.00]You better get your ass to Malenia right now.
[87:54.33]Fuck!
[87:55.55]You better get to Malenia right now.
[88:04.18]Nine.
[88:04.52]There's nine for you guys.
[88:05.70]What, you want a tenth?
[88:06.70]Fuck!
[88:10.43]Are you good?
[88:11.49]I was panicking there for a lot.
[88:14.20]I was very panicky.
[88:14.70]I have so much stuff almost ready to be done.
[88:18.94]But not quite.
[88:20.44]Dude.
[88:20.76]I mean, you have a fall death, don't you?
[88:23.88]Let's be honest.
[88:25.83]I actually might have one.
[88:28.95]I actually might have one, but now... I don't think I... If I've not... I cannot fall off a cliff.
[88:38.75]I cannot...
[88:41.72]That is going to be the hardest task of the entire day.
[88:44.33]You know what?
[88:44.85]If you go to kill Miquella or you go to kill Malenia, our closest one is up in like the tree area.
[88:52.43]You're going to go down to fight her and you're going to get a fall death.
[88:58.77]Well, you're not playing right now, right?
[89:00.83]I know I said go, go.
[89:02.05]Oh, go, go, go.
[89:03.11]Yeah.
[89:03.55]Sorry.
[89:03.83]Sorry.
[89:05.61]Alright.
[89:05.91]Well, I'll check back in with you a little bit later.
[89:09.95]Good luck.
[89:11.65]We're both going to be making two for thumbnails.
[89:16.35]Alright.
[89:16.59]Are you guys good?
[89:17.91]Let me lock back in.
[89:19.30]I'm at an advantage right now.
[89:20.52]This is what it feels like to be at an advantage.
[89:24.14]This has never happened in my whole life.
[89:30.06]I cannot do any falls.
[89:36.13]You know it's possible, but I got to just get through this.
[89:38.43]Alright.
[89:39.09]I'm not going to get cocky.
[89:40.85]Focus.
[89:42.34]Just focus.
[89:44.68]I'll listen to him.
[89:45.80]Focus on the prize.
[89:47.92]I forgot to tell him that the Vaati video is 45 minutes long.
[89:50.48]What the fuck?
[89:52.33]He's unmuted.
[89:55.79]Oh, why did I just go all the way around, dude?
[90:00.71]No!
[90:05.77]He's talking!
[90:06.51]He's distracting me!
[90:09.52]Does that count as a fall?
[90:13.15]Dude, he's like, he's talking in my ear.
[90:15.33]I thought he had something important to tell me.
[90:16.93]Oh my God.
[90:17.69]Alright.
[90:19.45]Where's the, where's the shortcut?
[90:22.30]I don't even have a Grace for the shortcut.
[90:29.38]Is it here?
[90:35.97]It's behind you.
[90:39.15]Guys, when there's a million things going on, I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[90:45.37]I think it's here.
[90:48.70]Somebody talking.
[90:49.76]A bingo.
[90:50.44]A fucking device.
[90:52.02]A thing popping up.
[90:52.76]A sound effect.
[90:53.48]I may as well be in eight different bodies.
[90:56.34]Okay.
[90:57.48]So now where the fuck is it?
[91:02.98]We're good.
[91:03.26]We're good.
[91:03.52]We're good.
[91:03.86]I just need to slow down.
[91:05.34]I am winning right now.
[91:07.68]There's no way.
[91:11.30]There's only exactly one thing going on right now.
[91:13.86]I have like nine windows open across three screens.
[91:18.44]What are you on about?
[91:20.68]What are you talking about?
[91:22.62]Huh?
[91:24.02]Let's go.
[91:30.21]That sounds like a you issue.
[91:34.58]Okay.
[91:34.90]Let's win.
[91:54.16]I didn't know that did damage until right now.
[92:31.48]So,
[93:05.93]I still have to get Malenia to phase two, which I don't know if that's going to happen, guys.
[93:12.71]Malenia is actually my least favorite fight.
[93:15.03]This is fall death check time.
[93:16.61]What?
[93:16.97]What?
[93:17.29]What do you mean?
[93:17.91]Fall death check, Jerma.
[93:19.53]What are we looking at here, boss?
[93:20.93]What do you mean?
[93:21.47]It's fall death now?
[93:23.11]It is 40 minutes.
[93:24.19]Least fall deaths at 40 minutes.
[93:25.73]We are 40 minutes in because we just did the 35 minute swear check.
[93:32.55]How many do you have?
[93:34.27]Zero.
[93:36.14]You have one fall, tell me about it Tell me about it, you have one fall It's unbelievable
[93:44.04]Dude, I went to the Haligtree, and what happened was I muted, and you kept talking.
[93:51.58]You kept talking.
[93:53.24]You didn't mute, and I got hit by a beam, and I fell off the edge.
[93:58.47]So you get to win that.
[94:00.07]Do you want to know what's actually hilarious about that?
[94:02.35]What is it?
[94:02.79]Because I didn't mute, I tried to mute while something was attacking me, and I died trying to mute for you.
[94:10.87]did you fall I didn't fall I got smashed by one of the boys but I didn't fall oh well it looks like looks like another uh interesting looks like nobody's gonna go to Malenia unless we've got a cross there
[94:32.92]I cannot believe that I fell literally a minute after.
[94:35.08]Dude, it was so stupid.
[94:37.02]I even said don't fall in the Haligtree.
[94:39.23]I warned you.
[94:39.89]I know, but then people were talking shit to me and I looked over at the chat and somebody yelled at me and then I heard you talking and I thought you were trying to pause again and then I fell off.
[94:52.04]Okay.
[94:52.30]That's embarrassing.
[94:54.08]How are you feeling about the state of this board?
[94:57.88]I first tried the Quizmaster.
[94:59.38]I can't believe you did that.
[95:04.83]You built it up.
[95:05.43]You said it was going to be very difficult.
[95:08.25]I thought it was hard.
[95:10.01]I thought it was like... Is that why you didn't try it?
[95:13.31]No, I was... You already did the nature photography thing.
[95:16.59]Well, no, you didn't.
[95:17.14]You did that first, didn't you?
[95:20.06]Uh, pretty... No, I did the Quizmaster before that.
[95:24.38]Okay.
[95:26.30]I... Okay.
[95:29.28]Okay.
[95:31.80]You thinking about what you're doing?
[95:33.20]I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do here because I think we both have a very similar thing.
[95:39.57]Do we?
[95:41.87]Yeah.
[95:42.77]When are you ready?
[95:45.43]I'm ready now.
[95:49.33]Good luck.
[95:50.43]Good luck.
[95:52.83]I cannot believe that he actually got it.
[95:56.81]I got this Grace, right?
[95:59.41]I have to go... I gotta go get the dance item.
[96:04.09]Okay, I have this Grace.
[96:06.02]The dance item, dance item, dance item is... It's like here.
[96:14.18]I think it's literally right here.
[96:15.46]And you go... One thing though, it's down here, right?
[96:20.40]The entrance is like here somewhere.
[96:25.71]It's either here, here, here.
[96:27.73]This is absolutely... This is the way to go, right?
[96:29.26]I can ask chat.
[96:31.86]It's the island.
[96:32.42]Yes, it is.
[96:32.90]Okay.
[96:33.80]It's a mausoleum, isn't it?
[96:36.14]It's the tree.
[96:36.64]Alright.
[96:36.84]Alright.
[96:37.96]He said we could have... Alright.
[96:40.08]Now I got to get down there.
[96:44.04]It's here.
[96:47.76]Like this way I can go.
[96:49.10]Okay.
[96:50.30]I know where I'm going.
[96:54.65]We gotta go now, though.
[96:56.41]Now, hurry up, hurry up.
[96:57.42]It's from here, and I think it's down this way.
[97:02.10]I think that's right.
[97:03.18]That's right, right?
[97:04.52]You go down, you go down the waterfall.
[97:17.33]It's... Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[97:19.33]I know where it is.
[97:20.21]I know where it is.
[97:24.37]put the Vaati video back on.
[97:25.51]I don't think Vaati video is going to... I don't think the Vaati video helps right here.
[97:34.86]He could go... Yeah, he could go diagonal.
[97:36.98]I need to play the rest of it.
[97:47.52]Shine her sisters.
[97:49.65]Okay.
[97:50.35]No, no, no, no.
[97:51.17]It's up here.
[97:51.55]I need bugs.
[97:52.03]Yep.
[98:12.22]What the fuck are you talking about?
[98:17.70]What just killed me?
[98:31.54]That did... That killed me.
[98:32.62]Alright, just... It's like here.
[98:33.56]Just go.
[98:33.84]... ... ... ...
[99:00.14]dude I can't do three things at once thank you I am in your debt yet again I think if the arm serves well enough it might be possible for me to wield the sword again
[99:26.07]So Congress, I don't know the border crisis.
[99:29.39]I don't I just want to watch the video Is it
[99:44.95]When Millicent receives her new arm, we learn that she inherited her mother's swordsmanship.
[99:48.19]When Millicent gets her arm, she inherits her mother's swordsmanship.
[99:55.31]She inherits it through the arm.
[99:57.41]Big fact.
[99:59.47]So, when we report back to Gowrie, we bring good news.
[100:02.65]So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement.
[100:04.99]This is a wonderful development.
[100:06.36]Thank you for your kindness.
[100:07.88]Now, Millicent may fully realize her true warrior's potential, like her beautiful mother.
[100:14.49]Then this way
[100:42.40]I have to watch the scary... Okay, I'm going the right way.
[100:44.64]Okay, Millicent inherits the arm.
[100:54.51]When she has the arm, she inherits the power with the golden arm.
[100:57.73]Okay.
[101:18.47]Okay, I did We need something in the background represents a horrific future the Lands Between it's no wonder that many are afflicted with frenzy Tempted by the desire to burn it away
[101:33.89]Millenia is... Stop screaming so loud I can't hear the video.
[102:01.51]To think we'd meet in such a place.
[102:02.61]What could your purpose possibly be?
[102:03.69]No.
[102:03.77]I don't know who you are.
[102:06.93]And what I know is good enough for me.
[102:07.88]Call upon me again.
[102:08.80]In battle.
[102:09.72]Should you have the need.
[102:11.66]I'm searching for you.
[102:12.16]He beat... What?
[102:13.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:14.04]He... He beat... He ate grandma's stew.
[102:21.83]There's no way he's gonna get through this video and give you three facts.
[102:24.95]There's no way he's gonna get through this fucking 45 minute video and give you three facts.
[102:28.63]I'm already way ahead of him.
[102:30.15]He was given a medallion.
[102:31.59]I'm 23 minutes in at times two speed.
[102:33.81]There's no way he gets it.
[102:35.38]No way he gets it.
[102:38.98]Here, at Castle Sol, Mikkola tried to resurrect Godwyn, his brother, whose soul was eviscerated by destiny.
[102:43.04]Mikkola tried to resurrect Godwyn at Castle Sol.
[102:45.54]There's two.
[102:46.02]But they were never set eyes upon it before the ritual effect.
[102:54.05]He ate IRL stew.
[102:56.47]Mikkola's promises are luring.
[102:57.69]I doubt you that commanding the army was one such act, for he was given half of a medallion that would have opened a path to Eilidh Tree, had he acquired the other half.
[103:03.61]In the end, Mikkola had nowhere to fade away to, and so refused to die.
[103:06.15]In the end, until you gave up.
[103:10.94]Miquella tried to resurrect Godwyn at Castle Sol.
[103:14.46]Millicent takes the power from the golden arm.
[103:18.35]She inherits the power.
[103:19.37]The reason why those hoofy guys with the horns blow it is to usher in a new lord.
[103:24.05]That's what it means.
[103:25.69]That's three.
[103:40.35]Godwyn was resurrected.
[103:41.39]Miquella tried to resurrect Godwyn at Castle Sol.
[103:43.80]When Millicent inherits the arm, she inherits the power as well.
[103:46.78]And then...
[104:03.80]Millicent is truly our super-Millenia.
[104:05.42]She is a scarlet bug.
[104:06.36]Millicent was found in Ionia, after Millenia's bloom.
[104:08.04]She was the most promising part of many, in fact.
[104:10.34]But bugs like Millicent aren't Millenia's only children.
[104:12.30]They're also pests, the kindred of rot.
[104:14.16]Millenia's abandoned children.
[104:15.76]We always knew these pests were intelligent, but our adventures with them shadowed us with their crafty, dark, which makes it all the more tragic when we have to kill half of their mother.
[104:26.62]I didn't notice you there.
[104:27.64]Welcome.
[104:27.82]How may I help you?
[104:28.20]My apologies, though.
[104:28.84]You hardly needed to see me like that.
[104:52.07]Oh, it's just, I realized that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and my eyes began to well.
[104:56.77]She is to meet them very soon, her sisters, and when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.
[105:02.23]Which is why, if you happen to be present for the girls' fight with her sisters, I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.
[105:08.16]It must be done by your hand.
[105:09.36]Gowrie wants you to side with the sisters, and that's not a fact, that's just like a statement of betrayal about who flowered most vividly.
[105:16.53]When Millenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.
[105:19.68]When Millenia ascends to godhood, Millicent also becomes reborn too.
[105:23.82]That's how it works.
[105:25.60]I beg of you, kill her with your own two hands.
[105:30.20]As her mother once did, Millicent needs to be pushed to the brink.
[105:32.50]That's a factor.
[105:33.58]Do not kill me right now.
[105:35.50]I know it's here.
[105:35.96]Along the edge.
[105:36.96]But he's wrong.
[105:50.56]What's all over me?
[105:51.68]What is it?
[105:52.12]Why did I just fall into like a fucking haystack?
[105:59.22]This is it, right?
[105:59.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[106:05.68]These sounds are not happening in my game.
[106:08.88]The sounds are not happening in my game.
[106:10.84]Oh, hello.
[106:12.40]Thank you for lending your hand.
[106:13.52]Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet.
[106:16.06]I feel as if I've been in a debt from beginning to end.
[106:17.96]Thank you.
[106:18.88]With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.
[106:23.72]But this is where things end.
[106:25.52]I paused to even tell you, but I took out the needle myself.
[106:29.08]Tell whoever put you up to this that if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.
[106:37.99]Oh shit, where was the video?
[106:40.67]I don't even remember where it was.
[106:44.69]I gotta focus right now.
[107:36.39]That's a lot of damage.
[108:20.51]I have no stamina!
[108:52.79]What are you talking about, dude?
[108:54.71]I can't hit with this thing at all.
[109:04.99]Nope, there's no movement over here.
[109:06.41]We're good.
[109:15.67]I accidentally clicked off the video.
[109:16.64]It was like 23 minutes.
[109:17.94]Right here.
[109:18.38]No!
[109:18.46]What the fuck, dude?
[109:19.12]What the fuck is going on?
[109:21.02]My mouse is...
[109:38.03]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[109:41.63]I wish I could just disable the mouse in the game.
[109:44.29]I'm actually mad about that.
[109:46.63]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[109:49.52]Mouse is sitting right next to me and I... That's so annoying.
[109:52.28]You sure you don't want the mouse to fucking just be if you touch it?
[109:56.16]Oh my god.
[110:08.35]That's the second time I've been screwed this playthrough.
[110:10.97]Just absolutely screwed.
[110:11.95]Where is it?
[110:31.74]Millicent is truly an offshoot of Malenia.
[110:33.34]She is a scarlet bud.
[110:34.24]The Millicent was found in Aeonia after Malenia's bloom.
[110:36.40]She was the most promising bird of many.
[110:37.56]In fact, but buds like Millicent aren't Malenia's only children.
[110:40.28]They're also pests, the kindred of rot.
[110:42.02]You gotta be kidding me.
[110:43.55]We always knew these pests were intelligent, but our adventures in the Realm of Shadow have also revealed that they're crafty.
[110:47.31]I have to get this.
[110:48.01]Which makes it all the more tragic that we have to kill them on the path to their mother.
[110:54.50]I am so seething from that, you have no idea.
[111:01.56]If the game detects your mouse, even for a second, it's just, now you're WSD!
[111:07.33]I didn't notice you there.
[111:15.15]Welcome.
[111:15.67]How may I help you?
[111:16.61]My apologies, though.
[111:17.64]You hardly needed to see me like that.
[111:20.01]Oh, it's just, I realized that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and my eyes began to well- Oh, God, this is gonna kill me.
[111:26.55]And when she dies, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.
[111:29.13]Jerry!
[111:30.17]Which is why, if- Oh, I just, I'm full tilt right now because of this.
[111:36.09]It must be done by your hand, no other.
[111:37.97]Millicent trusts you.
[111:40.30]I was way further in the video.
[111:42.02]Hold on, let me grab my mouse.
[111:48.08]It was right here.
[111:49.06]But, he's wrong.
[111:51.37]don't don't don't touch the mouse put the mouse shove the mouse up your ass because I I don't touch it if it detects it so
[112:18.76]Without your help, I could not have been able to protect you.
[112:21.26]I feel as if I've been in debt from the front end.
[112:24.69]Thank you.
[112:24.97]With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.
[112:28.69]I feel this is what I've always felt.
[112:31.33]I paused to even tell you, but I took out the needle myself.
[112:34.35]Tell me, and I'll correct you after this.
[112:37.33]If I had to fly into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am now.
[112:42.87]Alright, don't nobody touch anything I
[113:01.18]Gary was wrong about everything.
[113:02.42]For Millicent exceeded even her mother's call.
[113:03.86]She accepted defeat, instead of allowing the scarlet rot to thrive in the name of victory.
[113:07.50]Tragically, she accepts death in the roots of the haylick tree, right before meeting the mother she so desperately wanted to know.
[113:12.51]But in a way, Millicent's a new girl, because she came to know herself.
[113:15.23]And unlike her mother, she even died with predictability.
[113:17.41]She lived away for her own sake, not for Gary, an out-of-god, or an imperial.
[113:21.05]Maybe, on the other hand, holds to the promise of Nicholas Huss, before waking from a dream that she's been having for almost how long.
[113:38.19]I dreamt for so long.
[113:40.41]My flesh was now gold, and my blood rotted.
[113:44.13]Corpse after corpse, as I needed his return.
[113:55.08]Hear my words.
[113:56.04]I am Elenia.
[114:13.96]Stop backstepping!
[114:39.46]Wait.
[114:39.76]The scarlet blue flowers once more.
[115:09.08]Alright, come on, come on, come on.
[115:09.92]I need that dance.
[115:10.52]I need that dance.
[115:11.30]I have to, okay, I have to kill six enemies with this?
[115:18.08]I need 20 Jex to fucking use it.
[115:19.26]I have to respec.
[115:19.88]Can I still do the move?
[115:43.76]Okay, okay, okay.
[115:44.48]I can still do it.
[115:44.92]I can do it.
[115:45.22]I can do it.
[115:45.80]I need to kill six enemies.
[115:48.38]Where?
[115:52.22]I gotta go the... Okay, I know where to go.
[115:54.62]I know where to go.
[115:55.04]I know where to go.
[115:55.58]I know where to go.
[116:02.26]Oh, it's bug time.
[116:04.48]It's bug time?
[116:11.06]Hey, pause everything.
[116:11.88]Pause everything.
[116:12.42]It's bug time.
[116:13.04]It's bug time.
[116:14.44]Pause everything.
[116:16.34]It's time for bugs.
[116:20.28]Oh, sorry.
[116:20.84]Sorry.
[116:21.08]I was just finishing watching Vaati's video and giving three facts to my chat.
[116:25.44]How did you watch Vaati's latest video in that amount of time?
[116:30.96]Uh, ask my chat.
[116:31.64]What are you talking about?
[116:33.18]I was chilling.
[116:33.78]I was eating my grandmother's stew while just watching the video.
[116:39.02]How did you watch a 45 minute video?
[116:42.20]Well, let's just- let's just say, uh, Vaati video left ear, Chinese Bible right ear.
[116:48.58]You can only do- How many bugs you got?
[116:49.72]You can only do x2 on YouTube, what are you talking about?
[116:53.26]I... put that shit in Sony Vegas.
[116:57.17]You downloaded the video?
[116:58.81]I downloaded the video off the internet, and I put it in Sony Vegas to speed it up.
[117:04.59]Yes.
[117:05.43]You got me.
[117:06.39]How did you- excuse me, how was it possible that you could even hear anything?
[117:13.16]Because I, because it was, he was talking.
[117:18.89]And I could see like the visual, his visual cues are really good.
[117:21.71]He doesn't, you know, not a lot of credit on the lining up the information with the visuals.
[117:26.81]It takes a lot of work to do that.
[117:28.19]Okay.
[117:28.73]Okay.
[117:29.71]As a tuber, we can all recognize that.
[117:31.79]I appreciate the creativity with that one.
[117:34.81]Okay.
[117:35.29]Yeah.
[117:36.55]How many bugs do you have?
[117:38.10]How many bugs do you have?
[117:39.02]I want to hear it from you first.
[117:40.24]I want the count. 0.0.
[117:44.13]You have zero bugs.
[117:45.27]I think I have 0.0.
[117:46.91]What have you been doing?
[117:48.47]Killing fucking bosses.
[117:51.41]Why?
[117:51.69]Don't you know this is our bingo?
[117:54.75]That there's no boss squares?
[117:57.49]Which category are bugs in?
[117:59.08]I have... 20.
[118:03.26]I have zero.
[118:04.92]So you can take that one too.
[118:06.82]Okay, I'll take that one.
[118:08.08]Oh, I am in deep trouble.
[118:12.84]You sure are.
[118:16.62]Okay, I have to change everything.
[118:20.47]So you're going to kill six enemies with one dance or what?
[118:23.79]I hope so.
[118:26.77]I'm thinking maybe.
[118:31.65]What were the facts, by the way?
[118:33.85]Did I hear the three facts?
[118:35.11]Fact number one was what Malenia whispered in Radon's ear when she killed him, we now know is about sending him to Miquella.
[118:43.10]Yeah, I told you that two, three weeks ago, didn't I?
[118:46.04]It's in the video!
[118:46.94]I told you that three weeks ago.
[118:48.44]What do you mean?
[118:49.22]I'm supposed to watch the video, and if I know anything, I'm just supposed to... Well, Vaati, I already knew that.
[118:55.23]I told him that.
[118:56.17]I told him that enough.
[118:57.93]Thumbs down, Vaati.
[118:59.11]Try again.
[118:59.77]Oh, 20 facts about Elden Ring?
[119:02.97]I only didn't know one of those.
[119:04.15]Maybe next time you should write one fact you don't know and 19 other dumb things.
[119:08.93]uh there's a lot of info you get from fanny don't you don't how dare you by the way speak okay yeah well fact two fact two I learned that uh Caelid got blown up because of the first bloom I was a little confused on that and it corrected me because I thought she had bloomed three times already okay and I learned that display is an awesome place um there's a discount code you can use to get some really cool soulslike uh displays up on your wall
[119:35.95]Okay.
[119:36.41]What's the third one?
[119:37.65]That was the third one.
[119:38.83]I said the bloom.
[119:40.23]What Malenia said that the bloom was Caelid and that Displate.
[119:44.84]Okay.
[119:47.36]I'm going to let you have this one.
[119:50.90]I'll let you have this one.
[119:51.98]I think that it's, I think it's funny and fair that you did it that way.
[119:55.38]That's hilarious.
[119:56.12]I love it.
[119:57.58]It's alright.
[119:58.48]How far were you on the video?
[119:59.88]Uh, 38.
[120:00.08]Dude.
[120:01.30]Okay.
[120:06.98]I assumed you were doing it, so I just wanted to, like, step in front of you.
[120:11.83]Yeah, well, alright.
[120:13.61]Are you ready?
[120:14.73]Get ready for you to get stepped in front of, mister.
[120:18.07]Good luck.
[120:19.99]Bastard.
[120:20.75]I mean, the board isn't looking great for you.
[120:22.65]No, it's not.
[120:23.73]It is not looking great for me at all.
[120:27.15]But that doesn't mean I'm out.
[120:28.75]That's unfortunate that you couldn't not fall one time.
[120:32.83]I...
[120:36.08]I was... The Halleck Tree sucks ass.
[120:38.40]It's just like a gigantic fall.
[120:41.03]It's the whole map.
[120:41.91]You knew it was going to happen at least once.
[120:43.53]Dude, I didn't even realize.
[120:44.93]I'm set up for two different bingos right now.
[120:47.19]Okay, go get your bingo.
[120:48.83]Go get your bingo and have some fun, alright?
[120:50.77]Alright, I'll see you later.

[121:09.71]No, it's alright.
[121:10.19]It's alright.
[121:10.47]We don't need it.

[122:16.48]I'm not even going to be able to hurt this sheep.
[122:18.02]I have to have 20 decks or I can't hurt anything.
[122:24.16]Oh, come on.
[122:32.51]Who cares?

[123:56.08]This six here.
[124:02.68]This is going to be fucking unbearable.

[124:15.61]And without stopping.
[124:18.63]Oh my God, I have to go to like the water.
[124:21.57]Go to the Demi humans or something.
[124:25.37]Go to the Mohgwyn farm area.
[124:26.69]I can't even hurt those things at a plus zero weapon.
[124:32.93]Wait, hold on.
[124:34.12]I got to get a Diagro.
[124:37.46]Shit.
[124:42.70]I'm not in combat.

[125:51.43]This is so hard.
[125:54.23]Wolf pack?
[125:55.39]I don't know where six wolves are.
[125:56.87]Okay.
[126:09.19]I can't fucking believe I'm gonna lose this.
[126:16.25]I don't know where anything else really is.
[126:18.15]Agil Lake?
[126:19.27]Like just the random dickheads wandering around over here?
[126:21.82]There's a bunch- Agil's gonna come kill them.
[126:31.16]He's gonna get it.
[126:34.87]Dude, with no poise and no damage, this is un-fucking-bearable.
[126:48.10]Poison land squirts?

[127:12.31]That's too many people.
[127:14.71]Let me try this first.
[127:16.11]Because these guys are fucking useless.
[127:29.12]Get them in one shot.
[127:30.56]I'm going to have to.
[127:31.27]Okay, how many people are here?
[127:37.73]One, two, three, four, five.
[127:40.61]There's a lot of people here.
[127:41.61]I can't fuck this up.
[127:58.30]I'm not fighting dogs right now.
[127:59.86]Alright, get over here.
[128:02.20]One, two.
[128:05.20]Get over here.

[128:29.55]Four!
[128:36.00]YOU PIECE OF SHIT!
[128:45.31]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[128:48.33]I'm getting so fucking screwed.
[128:49.71]It's unbelievable.
[128:51.27]It's unbelievable.
[128:53.19]I... Okay.
[128:54.19]I feel like I have to do this.
[128:59.55]What are you trying to do?
[129:00.65]I have to kill six enemies in one dance.
[129:05.66]And you can't get hit.
[129:08.92]The Kalid zombies?
[129:11.76]I feel like I can do this.
[129:16.43]Alright, where are the Landsports?
[129:20.42]Like, I'm just going to sit here.
[129:21.70]Are the Landsports right here?
[129:23.16]I know there's like a hundred of them, like lined up like right here.
[129:27.50]It's like right here, right?
[129:32.45]They're in a guild.
[129:33.15]There's like a huge bunch of them.
[129:36.73]They're so tanky.
[129:37.73]I think I have to get this.
[129:39.23]I think I have to do the lake.
[129:40.97]That was four.
[129:42.27]I can definitely do it.
[129:45.00]I got to lock in right now.
[129:45.82]3, 2, 1, go.
[129:50.72]I don't want to spawn Agil.
[129:53.46]I could do it right there, but Agil spawns and I have to kill him.
[129:55.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[130:01.89]1.
[130:01.91]2. 3.
[130:17.71]Three.
[130:19.39]Four.
[130:21.55]I've ran out of fucking stamina.
[130:27.11]You can't be serious right now, man.
[130:30.18]You cannot be serious.
[130:37.64]You can not be serious.
[130:49.15]I am furious right now.
[130:52.05]Like I could put this controller in my mouth and eat it.
[131:03.13]I hope, I hope he's probably killing the remembrance boss.
[131:06.53]So I thought I was going to get this done in like 10 seconds.
[131:10.45]This is one of the hardest things in the whole fucking bingo board and I'm the one doing it.
[131:14.75]I'm about to get angry.
[131:20.77]Okay.
[131:22.27]It's easy.
[131:23.65]It's not.
[131:24.25]I'm telling you it's not.
[131:25.37]If you go do it and then you'll be like, oh shit, this sucks actually.
[131:37.84]Six.
[131:40.16]Alright.
[131:40.50]Fuck you game.
[131:41.26]That's six.
[131:51.38]Alright, I blocked him there.
[131:52.24]I gotta go kill a Remembrance boss right now with no emotion.
[131:56.22]Who's the closest DLC Remembrance boss?
[132:05.96]Oh.
[132:08.77]I hate it.
[132:09.57]Okay.
[132:09.71]I have to respec first.
[132:14.45]Okay.
[132:15.45]The Dancing Lion?
[132:21.70]This is close.
[132:22.40]This is closer than I want it, but we're alright.
[132:30.97]Honestly, Lion's probably easier.
[132:32.17]I'll try to do Lion.
[132:37.34]I do want gear though, bad.
[132:39.00]I'm just gonna go get something.
[132:55.38]Lion's going to be rough with the... Actually, I have... I do have gear.
[132:59.36]It's not the best gear, but I have it.
[133:03.90]Go buy Loretta's armor.
[133:06.35]Oh, that's right.
[133:06.81]I could... Is it at the thing?
[133:08.87]Let me see what's here.
[133:15.33]Are you ironed?
[133:22.07]I don't care about Elden Ring's fingers right now.
[133:24.66]I need my helmet.
[133:25.92]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[133:49.68]I don't think I even have enough to buy one piece.
[133:51.18]Okay, I'm buying the chest.
[134:03.77]Oh, I look pretty good.
[134:10.83]Alright.
[134:13.07]I'm going to get some... Let me calm down.
[134:14.83]I know there's a couple of fragments here.
[134:17.19]I'm going to get some more fragments.
[134:18.67]I got to go all in on this.
[134:38.28]Check this out.
[134:38.84]I'm going to lock in the most I've ever locked in in my whole life.
[134:52.88]Would a base game boss be easier?
[134:54.48]It would, but this is a DLC remembrance boss right in the middle.
[135:00.09]I might lose right here, but you know what?
[135:01.63]I gave it a good fight.
[135:11.25]I gave it a good fight but I'm I'm I think I'm alright okay so that gets me to three three blessings for a lion there is a Grace though okay I gotta calm down
[135:36.64]Avatar might be faster.
[135:38.70]I have to block him.
[135:39.54]Yeah.
[135:41.32]I could go to the Avatar.
[135:49.83]Do I pivot to the Avatar?
[135:53.03]Let me try.
[135:53.45]I'm already here.
[135:57.09]The Avatar is definitely easier.
[135:58.35]Alright.
[136:02.31]Well, let's just go.
[136:02.91]See if I can remember how to even get there.
[136:09.60]Okay, we're good.
[136:12.96]It's with no emotion though.
[136:13.92]That's alright.
[136:17.66]We do have the Frenzied Flame.
[136:26.16]Somebody just said he can't do it.
[136:29.39]Okay, we'll see.
[136:30.85]I'll try.
[136:40.59]Sturge has smoked a bowl?
[136:42.83]Oh, shit.
[136:45.30]It's over then.
[136:45.86]Alright, where do I go?
[136:52.88]I have not done this zone in a long time.
[136:55.52]This way.
[137:01.83]Alright, everybody give me your energy to beat the Divine Beast on first try.
[137:09.29]It's going to take a lot out of me to do it, but I'm going to give it my go.

[159:12.42]Dude, I'm shaking.
[159:17.86]Okay.
[159:19.48]You got to go around here.
[159:21.13]Dude, take a massive rip of a bong.
[159:38.56]Okay.
[159:40.32]How bad is Ster seething on his stream right now?
[159:47.49]Did he scream?
[159:58.65]The dude is traumatized.
[160:03.04]He's traumatized.
[160:06.74]I love how in the middle of this, somebody says, he seems fine.
[160:10.74]He seems fine.
[160:11.44]Alright, how many crosses is this?
[160:21.17]Well, he didn't scream.
[160:22.33]I only have two crosses.
[160:27.35]One, two, three.
[160:30.86]Yeah, I only have three.
[160:35.42]We have more important things to do right now, though.
[160:43.33]I need to get down here.
[160:58.23]Wait, does the divine beast have a remembrance?
[161:03.33]Yes, OK.
[161:14.66]You need to do the Christmas tree let.
[161:17.52]This will this.
[161:18.34]This will block him as well.
[161:20.02]Don't worry.
[161:20.38]I don't even know how to make a Christmas tree.
[161:57.78]I do need to block, though.
[161:58.92]Five.
[161:59.68]Okay, there's one by Theolia.
[162:01.49]I need one more.
[162:06.91]Shit.
[162:07.45]I may have made a big mistake here.
[162:09.41]I'm closer to Malenia than he is, though.
[162:10.91]Okay.
[162:28.59]He can still win.
[162:32.72]Even if I do the crosses or the thumbnail.
[162:39.30]I know what I can do.
[162:40.44]Very good.
[162:40.77]He doesn't even know where that guy is.
[162:47.95]He got the fall damage square.
[162:50.09]Oh shit.
[162:50.67]He did.
[162:51.75]Okay.
[162:52.05]Okay.
[162:52.29]Alright.

[162:56.75]Christmas tree.
[162:57.63]I don't know.
[162:57.97]What's the recipe for the Christmas tree?
[163:15.66]Duplicated.
[163:23.84]Okay?
[163:25.08]I need... We need to make a Christmas tree, or... Nope.
[163:30.05]I don't know if this time... I don't know if this time for me to make a Christmas tree, I might have to go do the Malenia thumbnail right now.
[163:40.22]Alright, the Olié is... Down... Where the fuck is the Olié?
[163:45.94]Okay.
[163:52.44]Tree is quicker.
[163:54.00]Where's the recipe?

[164:13.08]Just wait.
[164:13.50]Just hold on.
[164:16.27]Is it, which one is it?
[164:16.93]I gotta go to, I gotta go to Malenia.
[164:19.19]I gotta get a thumbnail ready.
[164:30.06]Is this even the right one?
[164:34.96]I don't know which is the right one.
[164:39.69]There we go.
[164:40.07]Go.
[164:40.13]Alright, you just have to get to Milenia to phase two.
[164:42.59]Dude, how do I get down from here?
[164:51.71]How did I miss this?
[164:54.38]Do the tree?
[164:55.54]It's going to take him a while to figure that out.
[164:58.70]Do you think this is throwing?
[165:03.67]I think it's going to take him a while to figure that out.
[165:05.59]I'm already... He has to come all the way down here.
[165:10.15]He has to come all the way down here.
[165:14.02]He still has a vertical win?
[165:17.28]Yeah, he doesn't even know where quee line is.
[165:19.68]And I do.
[165:22.32]Tree is in your bingo line.
[165:26.08]Yeah, but I'm playing for squares now.
[165:28.98]Guys, I'm playing for squares.
[165:31.97]If there can be no bingo, we add up all the squares at the end.
[165:37.83]How do, what do you mean how do I know?
[165:39.15]We made up the rules a week ago.
[165:48.91]Do the tree?
[165:49.51]I don't, you guys don't understand.
[165:53.05]Even if I do the tree, he's gonna, I need to, I have to do what I know how to do.
[165:58.68]You can do Malenia after.
[166:02.41]Alright, where is it then?
[166:04.19]Alright, if you're going to backseat me to a point where you're covering my eyes in the driver's seat, you tell me where to go.
[166:24.49]It's in Stormvale.
[166:25.93]Okay, where?
[166:27.55]Do I have to kill Margit and Godrick?
[166:34.93]No.
[166:35.24]Only Margit.
[167:06.23]Should have just went for the Rage Phase Dubnail.
[167:08.59]You guys are going to be the reason why.
[167:10.95]You guys gave me this bad advice.
[167:12.65]He's going to claim this in like two minutes.
[167:15.07]And then now I have to rush back to Millenia.
[167:20.22]This is on you.
[167:25.14]Do Blindfold and Margit.
[167:29.80]I need a Blindfold.
[167:38.66]outside the castle.
[167:46.37]Just pull your shirt over your eyes.
[167:47.42]That works.
[167:49.00]You don't have to beat Margit.
[167:50.40]Where is it then?

[168:43.98]How do you get up here?
[168:46.38]I can't look at the map because I'm in permanent combat.
[168:49.89]I hate that feature so much.
[168:51.07]I wish they would throw it away.
[168:52.59]The worst thing ever.

[170:23.63]Alright.
[170:23.91]That's fine.

[170:30.30]So what was your Goldfroy bit?
[170:32.65]What do you mean, Goadfroy?
[170:33.88]You've been talking about a lot of Goadfroy.
[170:35.82]I was gonna just call... Dude, it got way too fucked up.
[170:40.36]I was gonna be in a call with you and just turn to the camera and say, you'd be in a wicked fucking Goadfroy right now, and then claim the space.
[170:49.67]What does that mean?
[170:53.41]What?
[170:55.07]It was Joke's face.
[170:56.77]Oh, Jerma, you're being a wild hippo right now.
[170:59.42]Slay!
[170:59.96]Hey, were you going to fart into a lighter?
[171:02.54]No one's claiming that.
[171:03.52]I have told my chat, do not forget that I did that to you the other night in a private call.
[171:12.30]Do not forget that.
[171:13.96]You didn't fart into a lighter.
[171:15.64]You just farted wicked loud.
[171:16.62]How do you know there was no lighter?
[171:17.98]We didn't have webcams.
[171:19.32]You just farted wicked loud.
[171:21.92]That's all that happened.
[171:22.58]Yeah?
[171:23.75]Well, I had a lighter.
[171:24.55]You just couldn't see it.
[171:25.33]Are you serious?
[171:28.51]Dude, how do you feel about that middle... Let's put it on.
[171:32.37]How do you feel about that middle space being sniped?
[171:36.55]I feel like I really should be able to defeat one boss in this game.
[171:42.19]After Putrid Night took me two hours.
[171:45.31]I really feel like I'm... Oh, you were talking about how I'm a better gamer.
[171:49.99]Are you...
[171:51.71]You play less games than me.
[171:53.31]Again, you've played more Elden Ring than I have.
[171:58.07]So what you're saying is you're going to go kill Messmer?
[172:01.45]No.
[172:02.47]I don't want to do that.
[172:04.59]I mean, there's no more... Wait, there is one more available bingo.

[172:37.07]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[172:38.81]I have my bow.
[172:40.29]I don't care about shooting arrows.
[172:42.43]I need to go get ruined fragments.
[172:45.19]Where can I get ruined fragments?
[172:46.87]Right... Right now.
[172:50.20]Right now.
[172:53.31]It's on like the little thingies like these, right?
[172:56.53]Like these things go to the beginning area.

[173:04.78]Right?
[173:09.57]Yes.
[173:10.49]Let's go.
[173:34.32]Bingo on screen.

[173:41.34]That ain't happening right now.
[173:42.50]Time is of the essence.
[173:44.38]Time is of the essence.
[173:48.56]You can have a good refresher.
[173:49.44]Alright, and I need to pick a good tree to make a Christmas tree with.
[174:12.37]The hell was I going?
[174:13.41]Alright, there should be some up here, right?

[174:19.87]Usually.

[176:02.91]I am devastated.
[176:15.33]What am I missing?
[176:17.63]Wait, I need one more.

[178:02.77]I know I have to kill Queline now.
[178:05.13]Sturs does not know where that guy is.
[178:10.72]I don't.
[178:11.06]I just don't know where I might start.
[178:12.60]I might start from the beginning.
[178:21.25]I just don't know.
[178:22.29]I don't know.
[178:22.75]And I can't leave.

[179:11.18]Up or left?
[179:16.59]Up and then right down?
[179:20.63]Okay, I know where it is.

[179:52.15]so so
[180:18.80]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[180:21.20]Okay.

[180:33.89]I know where the Rolana skip is now.
[180:38.03]It's right here.
[180:38.67]It's like right here.
[180:41.23]Hurry up.
[180:53.89]Right over here.
[180:55.31]You go down and then you go around and then you go to the Spirit Spring.
[180:58.19]I know where to go.
[181:00.07]We're blocking Ster.
[181:01.17]He's going for a Hippo right now.
[181:04.93]Oh my goodness.
[181:08.71]I've been super high, strong and high energy today.
[181:11.47]Sorry.
[181:12.79]But when you're going up against Ster, there's something on the line here.
[181:20.17]There's something on the line.
[181:35.99]You high right now?
[181:36.87]No.
[181:37.97]I tell you.
[181:38.45]Hey, I tell you what's going to happen after this if I win this.
[181:41.49]Smoking a fat bull tonight.
[181:43.41]I don't smoke bulls.
[181:44.81]I don't even know how to do that.
[181:53.19]I don't even, I don't know, I don't know what a bowl is.
[181:55.63]Smoke a bowl?
[181:56.13]Like what, like a bowl of Cheerios?
[181:57.53]Yuck, what are you talking about?
[181:58.49]What's wrong with you?
[182:06.42]He is going to be so mad about the Queer Lion thing.
[182:14.78]He's going to be like, I don't know what that is.
[182:16.74]You know what that is.
[182:17.88]And he did take the Goldfroy, right?
[182:20.31]He did take Goldfroy.
[182:21.17]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[182:22.03]Am I going the right way?
[182:26.43]This is still the right way, right?
[182:33.89]Yep, there it is.
[182:36.03]I think it's right here.
[182:37.85]It's either straight ahead or it's right there.
[182:40.85]Right there.
[182:45.37]He got the hippo.
[182:48.55]It's okay.
[182:53.32]We don't need the hippo.
[183:02.19]he's cheating what do you mean he's cheating what how did he cheat what happened he killed a hippo in scribble knots and then we got to go up down and around I am prepared for this I am prepared for this I have to get the hell out of here
[183:38.06]And then do the avatar after quay line.
[183:39.52]That's the plan.
[183:40.96]That is the plan.
[183:46.16]Straight through here.
[183:55.37]And then you have to go down.
[183:56.86]I remember you have to go down like a hole somewhere.
[184:03.72]That wasn't a wild hippo.
[184:05.96]He summoned... You know what?
[184:08.76]It's all good.
[184:09.54]We're just doing it for fun anyways.
[184:10.84]It's okay.
[184:18.29]While I have a second, I know... Oh, I wish you could look at the map in combat.
[184:34.25]I know for a fact there's a fragment there, and I know for a fact there's a fragment here.
[184:55.76]I remember one being here precisely right.
[184:58.06]Yep.
[184:58.64]I knew it.
[184:59.26]I told you.
[184:59.96]Don't question me.
[185:08.40]Go to the church.
[185:09.10]Go to the church.
[185:15.82]Give me a sec.
[185:16.22]Give me a sec.
[185:16.56]Give me a sec.
[185:19.66]I know there's one right here too.
[185:20.52]You're wasting time.
[185:28.49]You're wasting time.
[185:29.43]I'm not.
[185:29.87]Trust me.
[185:30.23]Because if I'm going to the avatar after this, I want another level.
[185:32.87]Okay, now I need to go right there.
[185:48.90]Alright, Quinline, let's go.
[185:50.56]Let me block this shit right now.
[185:53.12]And then I'm going to go for the avatar.
[185:57.19]This is going to be close.
[185:58.23]This is close as hell.
[185:59.59]Look at how close this is.
[186:01.19]Holy, this is close.
[186:07.41]Once if you get Quinline, it has to come down to majority.
[186:10.79]Damn, really?
[186:19.21]There's a cross right here, but I'll get it.
[186:20.73]I'll get it later.
[186:21.21]I'll get it later.
[186:22.15]Just don't fuck up and kill Quillen.
[186:24.17]I need the Grace.
[186:24.89]I have to do it.
[186:26.23]I'm ahead.
[186:28.73]If I die to this, that's so far away.
[186:31.78]It would be such a bad idea.
[186:33.40]It would be such a bad idea.
[186:34.64]If Ster gets one more square, he gets majority.
[186:48.36]Oh, no.
[186:57.61]Oh, no.
[186:59.54]Do the horns?
[187:01.04]I know what to do.
[187:01.52]I know what to do about that.
[187:03.82]Kill queen line.
[187:04.50]And then I know what to do.
[187:11.77]He has... I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[187:14.45]This would be ten.
[187:15.67]And he has eleven.
[187:23.08]No!
[187:24.02]It's alright.
[187:28.11]Get the lighter quick!
[187:39.34]I'll beat his ass right here again, don't worry.
[187:46.70]Thou shalt not evade the flame of Messmer.
[187:55.87]Just bully, bully!
[187:57.93]Make him drink.
[187:58.39]I have no stamina!
[188:32.35]Walked him.
[188:40.86]Okay.
[188:42.52]I need to do two horns of the avatar.
[188:44.96]I'm going to go do two horns.
[188:46.56]I know exactly how to do this.
[188:48.08]Check this out.
[188:48.62]Ready?
[188:48.80]This is going to take a little bit of time.
[188:52.92]Oh no, he just needs one.
[188:57.79]He just needs one and it's over.
[189:00.95]Avatar, Malenia, the horns I can do.
[189:03.69]The horns I can do.
[189:09.39]Okay, I think I got a plan.
[189:13.41]Here's my plan with the horn.
[189:14.57]Oh, but I have to get a drop rate for that.
[189:19.48]Shit.
[189:22.30]Play horns in real life.
[189:23.30]I don't have any horns here.
[189:28.45]I could go do Malenia right now or just do the avatar because I know how to get there.
[189:38.18]Go do your car horn!
[189:41.46]I can't.
[189:43.54]Hold on a second.
[190:04.55]Can you hear me?
[190:04.91]Can you guys hear me?
[190:07.28]Can you guys hear me?
[190:07.80]Can you hear me?
[190:35.19]Did you guys hear it?
[190:37.13]Did you guys hear it?
[190:37.81]Did you hear it?
[190:38.47]Yeah!
[190:38.85]Alright, alright, alright.
[190:52.80]I gotta play one more.
[190:57.28]I just have to play one more horn.
[190:59.10]And I know where to go.
[191:01.78]I know where to go, I know where to go.
[191:08.08]I'm ready.
[191:08.30]I know where to go.
[191:14.99]Trombone?
[191:20.64]Cheeto's not a horn.
[191:24.02]I know where to go.
[191:25.13]Okay, I think I just gotta get lucky.
[191:34.78]Okay.
[191:36.06]Here's my plan.
[191:37.00]The plan is... I'm just gonna go to the finger runes.
[191:42.62]Which are... I got the Grace.
[191:44.94]Right there.
[191:49.62]Shit.
[191:50.40]Okay.
[191:50.76]I gotta go this way.
[191:55.15]That way, that way, that way, that way.
[191:56.09]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[191:57.43]Wait a minute.
[192:03.39]I have a better idea.
[192:23.60]Where are they?
[192:27.18]I know there's a few weirdos over here.
[192:45.91]Nothing.
[192:51.35]It's a bad spot.
[192:52.47]There's the gargoyle.
[192:53.39]I just, they just need to die.
[192:58.54]Any more?
[192:58.88]There's like, yeah, there's two.
[192:59.84]Okay, there's a few right here.
[193:03.28]Come on, man.
[193:04.00]Come on, give it to me.
[193:09.78]Shit.
[193:11.36]It's okay.
[193:16.53]Back to the halog tree?
[193:19.83]I don't have the... We don't have the Grace and I can't get there, I don't think, because you fall down.
[193:36.80]Alright.
[193:39.54]Do a ton of item discovery.
[193:44.10]I do... What do you want right now?
[193:46.52]Do a horn sound.
[193:47.20]I'll get it.
[193:48.18]Look, I'm going to get so lucky right now.
[193:51.02]Just watch.
[194:25.18]Go to the first Grace.
[194:26.74]Yeah, trying to run backwards from here.
[194:33.20]I have no idea how to get back from here.
[194:35.52]This place is so confusing.
[194:43.91]You can open Trombone Champ.
[194:45.15]I don't even have Trombone Champ downloaded.
[194:47.21]Discord has a horn?
[194:54.62]How do I do it?
[194:58.82]This is going to be really loud for him.
[195:01.04]Hey, uh, Ster?
[195:01.90]Yeah?
[195:03.64]I just want to let you know, like, just turn me down, because this is probably going to be very loud.
[195:07.36]Oh, no, you, no, no, no, no.
[195:09.30]Just turn it down.
[195:10.28]Just turn me down.
[195:11.36]Okay.
[195:12.58]And I have to turn everything down here.
[195:21.45]That's the second horn.
[195:24.29]That, you're really going to count that?
[195:27.45]You're really going to count the womp, womp, womp?
[195:30.57]Should we count you opening Scribblenauts and killing a hippo in a different game and it's not even a wild hippo?
[195:38.41]You had to summon it?
[195:40.79]Okay, your chat can't read.
[195:42.97]Everybody you send over here to watch me and spy on me can't read and has no comprehension of reality.
[195:49.92]Because in Scribblenauts, you can spawn anything.
[195:52.06]So I spawned a literal and I quote, wild hippo.
[195:55.40]Okay.
[195:57.78]If you can spawn pregnant babies in Scribblenauts, you can spawn a wild hippo.
[196:02.69]Okay.
[196:06.37]Just was checking to see.
[196:08.09]Okay.
[196:08.43]So are you not counting that one?
[196:11.23]No, it's fine.
[196:11.97]You did it.
[196:13.45]I felt bad doing it because I did get a wild hippo.
[196:16.30]So you're correct.
[196:17.12]You're correct.
[196:20.22]I did my actual car horn to the other one, by the way.
[196:25.52]Could chat hear it?
[196:26.83]Yeah.
[196:28.85]Thankfully, they could hear it.
[196:32.46]Okay.
[196:32.86]Well, congratulations.
[196:34.52]Okay.
[196:36.86]Where are we at now?
[196:38.46]You got to mark it.
[196:41.84]Alright.
[196:42.50]No playing.
[196:43.24]Pause everything.
[196:44.78]What?
[196:44.96]Do you want to pause everything to go over?
[196:46.88]Because this is getting really juicy.
[196:50.61]We're pausing.
[196:52.15]Yeah, but you want to pause?
[196:53.61]We should pause chasing me.
[196:55.35]Okay, well, you don't want to pause because this is this is an incredibly wild thing we got going on here.
[197:02.02]I need Okay, I can I think I can pause here pausing my timer is broken.
[197:06.74]Also, that's fine.
[197:08.52]Okay.
[197:10.08]So
[197:11.54]As it stands right now, first of all, what a game.
[197:14.48]This has been a lot of fun.
[197:16.26]You have been unbelievable.
[197:17.44]What an unbelievable competitor Sterz.
[197:19.58]What a great opponent.
[197:20.98]Great opponent.
[197:21.48]We really have filled out this whole tree.
[197:24.53]Uh, so here's where it gets interesting because I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[197:29.69]You have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[197:34.71]If you, you, you have won the game if you do any of these.
[197:40.72]So I have to do all three of them before you do one.
[197:44.48]Yes.
[197:44.70]You're going to do it.
[197:47.76]You're going to kill the, the, the shadow avatar and Messmer.
[197:53.25]I mean, I could go... I could force you to go fight Messmer.
[198:02.90]Maybe.
[198:04.36]And then maybe try to trickle in because you're going to die like 100 times and then I'm going to die 150 times.
[198:09.01]No, Messmer's a loser.
[198:15.31]Especially the Sunflower, the easiest boss.
[198:20.81]I'm confident I could kill the sunflower, but it's very far away.
[198:25.79]Yeah, so are you going to go get to it or are you just going to yap?
[198:29.96]I just wanted to take a breather.
[198:31.42]I feel like I've been clenching for three or four hours.
[198:34.74]I don't know how long it's been.
[198:36.66]Yeah, it has been.
[198:38.52]I think it's seven.
[198:39.30]A seven hour run.
[198:41.17]Damn.
[198:44.30]Okay.
[198:45.24]Are you ready?
[198:46.46]Good luck.
[198:47.58]It's been a blast.
[198:48.76]We gotta end it.
[198:50.26]I'm going for it.
[198:52.50]Good luck, man.
[198:53.33]This has been awesome.
[198:54.33]Have a good time.
[198:55.45]You're gonna beat me.
[198:57.43]I'm not gonna beat him.
[199:01.89]Let me make sure I can see everything.
[199:03.11]Okay.
[199:09.67]I am...
[199:12.57]We're locking in.
[199:13.63]I have to go to... I'm going to Malenia.
[199:19.68]If I can do Malenia right now and then get to the Avatar before he does, he might just go for Messmer.
[199:25.48]I don't know what his plan is.
[199:26.36]I really don't.
[199:27.94]Okay.
[199:29.52]So... Let's move.
[199:37.52]Lock in.
[199:41.07]Thanks for watching!
[200:26.26]What I'm doing is insane!
[200:49.43]Oooooooooo.
[201:43.75]How you gonna beat Millenia like this?
[201:45.03]Because I'm locked in.
[201:51.22]Based jump attack.
[201:57.05]You gotta do what you gotta do to win.
[201:58.79]That's all I'm saying.
[202:01.49]Based jump attack.
[202:03.31]Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to win bingo.
[202:05.81]That's all I'm gonna say.
[202:08.92]Okay, now it's this way and you go all the way around.
[202:12.20]I gotta lock in because I have to beat Malenia.
[202:15.30]I gotta get through phase one.
[202:30.51]Oh shit, I'm looking at chat.
[202:44.42]Dude, I don't even know where the f- Where am I going?
[202:46.18]Where is Malenia?
[202:47.15]I don't remember any of this.
[203:03.18]Over there.
[203:30.43]I can do phase one.
[203:31.49]I can.
[203:32.66]Sit here.
[203:35.49]I thought this was your favorite game ever.
[203:37.91]It probably is.
[203:53.30]There is another.
[203:54.14]It's a whole long way to go to get to Millenia.
[203:55.88]I forget how far it is all the way down the Hallow Tree.
[204:09.70]Where do I go?
[204:10.93]Oh, God.
[204:16.55]No, don't.
[204:24.21]I think I'm making it.
[204:25.78]Let's go.
[204:27.44]Phase one.
[204:27.98]I just got to dodge two water fowls and that's it.
[204:30.80]Okay.
[204:40.21]Let's go.
[204:42.71]Turn the audio back up.
[204:53.56]Is it not up?
[204:54.26]There you go.
[205:13.35]Thank you.
[205:50.33]Thank you.
[206:20.69]Thank you.
[207:13.93]Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.
[207:16.95]No, what the fuck?
[207:18.21]Oh, dude, this game sucks.
[207:45.56]I swear to God, this fucking game is such a stupid piece of fucking shit, man.
[208:10.94]I'm going to take a screenshot.
[208:12.00]I need a screenshot of that.
[208:13.28]Hold on.
[208:13.97]Wait, what if I just, what if I hold?
[208:15.23]Hold on.
[208:15.73]Wait, wait, wait.
[209:05.67]I need an arrow.
[209:48.67]It needs to be.
[209:50.53]Give me a second.
[210:25.33]I got it.
[210:25.77]I got it.
[210:26.23]I got it.
[210:26.81]That's it right there.
[210:27.75]That's it right there.
[210:28.45]That's a thumbnail.
[210:29.37]You just saw it.
[210:30.21]Literally impossible.
[210:30.97]I'm freaking out, pointing at the door.
[210:32.25]That's a thumbnail.
[210:32.81]I just went.
[210:34.19]Well, that's it.
[210:34.71]I got it.
[210:36.17]That's a win.
[210:36.79]Look at my hair.
[210:37.23]What is my hair doing?
[210:38.89]Why do I have, like, what's going on with my hair back here?
[210:43.84]What is happening to my head?
[210:45.22]Here we go.
[210:55.29]Oh my God.
[210:55.73]I can't even see.
[210:56.43]Okay.
[211:03.80]Hold on.
[211:07.14]Where'd it go?
[211:07.78]It's on my map.
[211:09.28]It's on my screen somewhere.
[211:20.59]Oh shit.
[211:21.19]Come on.
[211:21.77]Let me show it on screen.
[211:30.44]Okay.
[211:31.65]It's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
[211:42.25]There you go.
[211:46.68]Oh my god, I hate using OBS.
[211:49.30]I hate everything today.
[212:06.10]this person does not give a shit about their youtube channel alright let's claim it now I have to go kill the avatar right now
[212:31.76]There it is.
[212:32.50]There's where it is right now.
[212:33.88]He could be killing the avatar right now.
[212:40.92]This is so stupid.
[212:42.02]I love it.
[212:42.44]Okay.
[212:42.96]Alright.
[212:43.16]You ready?
[212:43.54]Let's go.
[212:44.94]I can't, I gotta, I gotta make my screen smaller.
[212:47.18]Hold on.
[212:55.25]Let's move.
[213:03.35]Okay.
[213:03.71]So I gotta go like down here.
[213:06.63]This is a long way.
[213:09.32]This is a long way away.
[213:22.59]It's up.
[213:25.23]I'm pretty sure it's this way.
[213:28.27]You go here.
[213:30.57]through there's like a little hole in the ground here.
[213:32.64]I think that's right.
[213:33.42]Let's go.
[213:37.09]This has been so stressful, but it's been so much fun.
[213:39.73]I hate this, but I love it at the same time.
[213:41.23]Is that weird?
[214:02.44]It's good for your ADHD brain.
[214:04.14]It actually, I don't think is good at all for my ADHD brain.
[214:10.15]I think it's the worst thing ever.
[214:11.19]I think I have enough to do it again.
[214:15.91]Okay, I think six is more than enough to kill both Messmer and the Avatar.
[214:26.84]But holy shit, killing Messmer is such a huge pain in the ass.
[214:29.26]That's what it's going to come down to.
[214:33.08]OK, I know it's a drop down.
[214:35.78]Is this one that's bait?
[214:36.98]That's what I remember.
[214:37.74]There's a bait drop down.
[214:41.10]This is the bait one.
[214:41.96]This is you can't get down there from here and if you can.
[214:44.10]I don't know how because I try.
[214:46.64]I remember trying.
[214:47.40]OK, this is it right here.
[215:03.36]Good idea.
[215:03.70]Hey, can we get a pause?
[215:07.40]Yep.
[215:11.10]I have pause.
[215:12.60]What's happening?
[215:15.46]My stream is one FPS.
[215:17.88]One FPS?
[215:19.08]Yeah, so there's some giga lag going on.
[215:21.18]Okay.
[215:21.60]Do you want to just restart?
[215:25.90]Restart the whole bingo board?
[215:27.58]Well, just the game so you can get back in.
[215:30.32]Well, I don't know what my problem is, because I'm talking to you just fine, I think.
[215:34.92]Is it just Elden Ring that's messing up, or is it something else?
[215:40.91]I'm going to check to see, like, hey, I'm going to go watch, like, an original Jerma video and see how quick it loads.
[215:47.15]Nice.
[215:55.54]They make speed tests, actually.
[215:58.11]I actually started typing in Jerma985 that'll test my internet oh wait do you mean like your internet is is your like stream is not doing well yeah oh my upload is 0.8 right now oh no yeah uh I have Jerma chatters
[216:19.82]I apologize for saying that you don't know how to spell a four-letter word, that it wasn't a wild hippo.
[216:26.86]I want to rescind my earlier comments.
[216:28.86]I was in the heat of the moment.
[216:29.90]We're in a very competitive game right now.
[216:31.86]I appreciate the creativity.
[216:33.26]I think it's great.
[216:36.98]Yeah, that is a 0.4 megabytes upload.
[216:40.18]Have you been having internet problems like recently or no?
[216:42.50]Or is it just like right now?
[216:44.24]First one in a long time.
[216:47.73]Do you want to try just to reset your stream and try to connect to a different server?
[216:55.57]It's not the server.
[216:56.89]It's my internet.
[216:59.81]Well, you want to try to restart your computer?
[217:06.28]What do I want?
[217:08.18]I'm good to chill, if you want.
[217:09.66]Or if you want to... At first, I just want to wait like five minutes and see if it gets better.
[217:14.74]No, it's all good.
[217:15.82]The restarting.
[217:16.88]It is two megabytes.
[217:18.38]You're climbing.
[217:19.99]You're climbing.
[217:21.37]I mean, we could always talk about like... Yeah, I think it's getting better.
[217:26.29]What do you want for Christmas?
[217:27.83]It's coming up again.
[217:28.51]I think I would like a... EDF session.
[217:34.73]With Sterk.
[217:36.24]That's for my birthday.
[217:37.40]That's already for my birthday.
[217:38.74]Well, I want it for my Christmas present, so you're going to have to play it twice.
[217:43.41]I think we're back.
[217:47.87]We can give it a few minutes.
[217:50.13]No, I think we are.
[217:51.03]My stream says I was 14,000 kilobytes a second, which you are not allowed to do on Twitch.
[217:59.57]So I'm a little confused.
[218:02.49]Do you stream with like CBR or VBR?
[218:07.86]uh cbt I don't know what either of those are it's back down again see a variable would make you jump around which is a variable frame rates variable bit rate how did you get down to Malenia so fast how do you think I lost the bottom left square by falling to my death true you beat you like you beat Loretta and ran all the way down there
[218:37.82]I did that a long time ago.
[218:39.40]That was actually one of the things I did early.
[218:41.01]Oh, that's why.
[218:42.15]I just beat Loretta and I was like, holy, he got there quick.
[218:45.45]Yeah, I did that.
[218:46.97]I pivoted once I saw that you were, I think you got three squares in one of these verticals.
[218:54.44]And I was like, oh no, I have to leave.
[218:56.04]I think that's when I pivoted to the dance.
[218:59.32]I was like, I have to do this.
[219:01.20]Otherwise, he's just going to claim the whole row.
[219:05.01]Yeah, at that point I should have danced.
[219:06.30]I knew it because I was right near where the sword is.
[219:10.42]It was honestly that was really hard.
[219:12.92]That took me a long time.
[219:15.94]That was a really good square.
[219:17.10]That was a really good idea.
[219:18.02]That was a good Ster idea, by the way.
[219:20.12]Because that was actually horrible.
[219:23.68]Because in one dance.
[219:25.08]Yeah, because in one dance, if you get hit by anybody and the six people around you.
[219:30.45]You're going to get staggered out.
[219:31.71]You're going to get just like poise broken out.
[219:33.75]Yeah.
[219:34.69]It was awful.
[219:38.16]But it was, it was, it took me a little while to do it.
[219:41.72]That's why I was, I thought you're going to snipe it.
[219:42.94]I was like, oh my God, I was so pissed off.
[219:45.08]I was sitting here seething.
[219:46.20]I thought you were doing it.
[219:47.14]And like, you were doing way better than me.
[219:48.32]And like, that was making me really mad.
[219:49.83]You know what I mean?
[219:50.71]Like, like I got here first and I got the item first and he still beat me.
[219:56.81]That's what was playing a thousand times in my mind.
[219:59.97]Yeah.
[220:00.17]So like when I got to Rinala first,
[220:03.67]and was fighting R'Nalla first and just can't beat a boss in Elden Ring?
[220:10.97]I didn't even go for R'Lana, dude.
[220:12.35]I killed the Divine Beast.
[220:13.77]The Lion?
[220:14.61]Yeah.
[220:15.77]Oh, that makes a lot more sense.
[220:17.09]I was thinking while I was doing it that I wish I went for the Lion instead, but I had already gotten so close to R'Lana that I went for it.
[220:24.88]I would rather fight the Divine Beast than R'Lana.
[220:28.06]Yeah, I'd rather beat Divine Beast like three times in a row.
[220:32.56]Yeah.
[220:34.30]I was thinking of just going to the avatar, but that middle spot, you could have made bingo like four different ways if I didn't do that.
[220:47.17]If I did not do that, you would have won an hour ago.
[220:50.55]I mean, I would have won when I took the square instantly.
[220:56.75]You would have.
[220:59.72]I'll show it on screen.
[221:02.46]okay here's the deal here's the deal here's the deal here's the deal um I don't want to hold up everything because of my internet it's coming up and down and up and down um we only have like one thing left so maybe I don't know if you were planning on doing another bingo board after this if you were up for it or we could just like try and finish this and I'll just I'll stay with the laggy stream and we only got like two more squares um how about this
[221:29.81]I have not, we've not really taken a break.
[221:32.43]Do you want to take a break and like, I'll get some water.
[221:34.46]And I mean, cause we're going down to the finish line here.
[221:36.52]So if we can wait it out for like five, 10 minutes, I'm cool with that.
[221:39.60]That's fine.
[221:44.24]Um,
[221:49.58]already won anyways it I okay without you telling me what you're doing I mean well here's the thing you could just tell me what you're about to do I mean because if you take if you take any of these it's over so if you if you're gonna kill the avatar like right now then you're gonna win I'm not close to either of them okay like at all I haven't been to that castle that leads to both of them yet and I haven't killed vernala so I don't have the easy way to get there
[222:18.97]Or you haven't killed Rinala either.
[222:21.21]I have not.
[222:22.17]We're like in the exact same spot.
[222:23.83]You just have to do two and I have to do one.
[222:26.73]I have to kill both these bosses before you kill one of them.
[222:29.03]Yes, that's a sad state of affairs for me.
[222:32.67]I don't know.
[222:33.13]At this point, it's looking doable.
[222:37.44]Well, I don't mind.
[222:40.62]What about... What if you just reset your router or something or reset your stream?
[222:49.08]Yeah, I'm gonna restart my computer.
[222:50.54]Yeah, we how it is.
[222:52.11]But if it's not good, then we should just like, do it.
[222:56.65]Okay.
[222:57.95]Okay, I'm gonna restart.
[223:01.73]Okay.
[223:02.75]Okay.
[223:03.59]That works.
[223:03.98]Yeah, we can just chill.
[223:06.82]Okay, I'll be right back.
[223:08.12]Do a handstand or something cool.
[223:09.70]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[223:13.56]Pray for your internet.
[223:16.17]OK.
[223:17.39]Alright.
[223:17.65]Well, that's fine.
[223:18.17]That's alright.
[223:19.15]That doesn't bother me.
[223:21.72]As somebody that's had a million Internet problems in my life, I get it.
[223:25.14]It sucks.
[223:26.04]And it's like, oh, no, it's not his fault.
[223:28.68]It's fine.
[223:30.12]It's OK.
[223:31.72]It happens.
[223:32.10]It happens.
[223:32.42]It's alright.
[223:34.58]So.
[223:38.57]I have to.
[223:39.35]Yeah, I got to figure out how confident I am.
[223:44.03]with this I think I honestly the hammer I know it's like jumping r2 spamming fucking loser uh I feel like I've sprinkled in a lot of other moves you should do Messmer first
[224:06.14]I wonder I I don't know I guess that but no because if he knows that I'm doing Messmer he's probably gonna go for the avatar let's just let's be honest it's gonna come down to who kills the avatar first so alright let me take a break I'll be right back I will see you guys in a minute and maybe like five minutes we'll give it a few minutes see you in a few
[231:49.10]Okay.
[231:49.58]Hello.
[231:52.00]I am back.
[231:59.11]How are we doing?
[231:59.55]Let's start doing.
[232:07.43]Hello.
[232:07.95]How are you?
[232:08.45]How you doing?
[232:11.81]Think good.
[232:14.71]Cool.
[232:24.39]I'm ready when you are.
[232:28.24]Oh, okay.
[232:28.78]Yep.
[232:32.70]I'm just doing good.
[232:36.44]Although he, um, got to figure out something with him.
[232:40.74]He's been, he's been sneezing a lot.
[232:42.72]Took him to the vet and he was on an antibiotic and he's still, I think he got better, but he's still like sneezy.
[232:51.91]He's like sneezing a lot.
[232:55.14]Um, so I'm going to have to, yeah, it's, it's weird though, because he's never had that problem before.
[233:06.94]You know, he's like, oh, I'm like sneezing.
[233:08.83]I'm sneezing.
[233:09.39]And it's like, well, you got to figure out what's going on.
[233:11.49]I don't know if he, um, it doesn't look like he's like anything's up there or anything.
[233:17.15]And he was on an antibiotic and, um, yes, it is.
[233:25.75]They can hear you now.
[233:29.95]You are now audible.
[233:32.41]You could have developed allergies.
[233:34.12]It's something like that.
[233:35.08]Yeah.
[233:38.06]Maybe as he's gotten older.
[233:39.12]Most likely.
[233:41.04]Replace your furnace filter.
[233:42.98]I do that.
[233:46.07]I'm on top of that every 30 to 60 days.
[233:49.25]I do it every time.
[233:51.93]Okie dokie.
[233:52.78]I am ready to lose this.
[233:56.58]Bingo.
[233:57.58]Well, once my controller turns on.
[234:00.06]I am just telling you that you have to just kill one boss.
[234:04.01]I have to kill two and one of them is Messmer.
[234:07.15]So... But Messmer is like the easiest boss in the DLC.
[234:10.73]You keep saying that, but I don't think you mean that.
[234:15.07]Don't you just like dodge?
[234:21.69]Turn your Windows audio back up.
[234:23.15]You turned it way down during the horn bit.
[234:25.47]Oh, yeah, I did.
[234:29.97]My stream's been so quiet for like an hour.
[234:36.81]Alright, are you good?
[234:38.57]I'm good.
[234:39.00]Are you good?
[234:40.98]Let's go for it.
[234:44.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[234:46.58]No.
[234:47.60]What?
[234:47.84]Wait, my stream is not working.
[234:50.08]Oh, it's not working.
[234:52.65]Like I said, I think... I don't know.
[234:55.09]We can kind of honor system.
[234:57.49]I don't know.
[234:58.09]I don't know if I'd even bother streaming with it being as bad as it is.
[235:04.82]It's alright.
[235:06.16]Do you want to just stay in the call and take a screenshot?
[235:11.14]I'm just going to end and we can talk about it.
[235:16.47]I turned it off.
[235:17.65]Let's just play.
[235:18.25]Alright.
[235:19.71]Hey, what's up?
[235:21.84]Uh, so, you need to go kill the Avatar and, or Messmer.
[235:29.28]Yes.
[235:29.48]But, like, should you just stay muted?
[235:32.40]I feel like you should, should we just hang out a bit?
[235:34.49]But if, but you can distract us by talking.
[235:37.79]Uh, but you don't think that you're going to distract me by talking?
[235:40.41]That's very true.
[235:44.03]Okay.
[235:45.67]Uh, I'm ready to go when you are.
[235:47.35]I'm, I, we know what we're doing.
[235:48.99]We know what we have to do.
[235:50.85]Alright.
[235:51.71]Tree.
[235:52.71]Two.
[235:53.65]Oh, two, three, go.
[235:55.21]It's going to be even.
[235:55.95]I don't remember how to get there.
[235:58.85]I'm on a few of these.
[236:00.39]So, like, before I had chat help.
[236:03.57]Oh, chat, you can help Ster.
[236:05.69]Just open my chat.
[236:12.95]Okay, chat, I'm going to hand you guys the controller.
[236:16.52]Yeah, you guys can help, sir.
[236:18.64]You can help.
[236:18.98]Look, we're at the very end.
[236:20.72]We got this last little bit we have to do.
[236:24.00]We could use the help.
[236:25.50]We really could.
[236:26.01]It's been a grueling four hours.
[236:31.67]Absolutely grueling Elden Ring.
[236:35.49]It's been grueling.
[236:37.18]Prepare to die.
[236:38.60]This is the hardest game ever made.
[236:41.56]No, it's the hardest game at Walmart.
[236:45.08]Because, like, Boshi exists.
[236:47.06]Can't buy that at Walmart.
[236:48.40]This is the hardest game at Walmart.
[236:50.14]Want to know, is Sekiro harder?
[236:53.24]Uh, yeah.
[236:55.66]So Sekiro is still the hardest game at Walmart?
[236:59.20]Is Sekiro at Walmart?
[237:01.45]Yeah, I think so.
[237:02.99]Are they selling physical copies of these games?
[237:07.39]Somebody just said Sekiro is not hard.
[237:09.53]Ban that person for one minute and make them have to sit there and look at it for 59, 58, 56, 54, 50.
[237:16.83]There's other numbers that come before and after it.
[237:22.08]Yeah, and tell me their name and they'll be banned for one minute in my channel as well.
[237:26.08]I don't even, I don't know who it was.
[237:27.56]I just see colors and then text.
[237:28.90]Well...
[237:37.37]I'll just do a slash ban all and see if I get them.
[237:40.94]No, you don't have mod on my channel, do you?
[237:43.96]No, on my channel.
[237:46.18]Oh, you just made me shit my pants.
[237:49.30]I don't think there is a ban all command.
[237:52.16]Ban all people.
[237:54.21]You know what?
[237:54.77]One guy said something I didn't really like.
[237:56.59]I'm going to reset the channel.
[237:58.37]That's so funny.
[237:58.85]I'm going to get a whole new community.
[238:01.53]I only want new viewers.
[238:06.51]Slash ban space all.
[238:14.55]No, you don't trust me with mod on your channel, apparently.
[238:19.19]I don't trust anybody with mod on my channel.
[238:22.09]Oh, it's sacred ground hollowed.
[238:23.83]Blessed by the paladins.
[238:32.69]Yeah.
[238:40.55]Hey, bros!
[238:42.11]Bros, what?
[238:43.93]What was that?
[238:47.05]The fuck?
[238:47.53]I thought that was you.
[238:48.25]I was about to be pissed at you.
[238:50.15]Me?
[238:50.57]What?
[238:51.07]Never mind.
[238:51.60]Don't worry.
[238:54.64]What?
[238:55.50]I thought you just screamed in my ear.
[238:58.58]Playing Devil May Cry over there?
[239:01.94]Getting another noise?
[239:03.54]I'm so fucked up right now.
[239:04.99]There's too many noises.
[239:08.82]I've been on edge all day.
[239:10.68]I feel like I've been operating.
[239:12.54]Why?
[239:13.68]I don't know.
[239:15.24]Is this stressing you out?
[239:16.68]Yeah, it does.
[239:18.52]Big time.
[239:19.62]But I love it.
[239:20.45]But I hate it.
[239:34.88]I mean, for progress's sake, because there's no continuity anymore with my stream down.
[239:40.69]I have just done the Rolana skip.
[239:43.05]So I am past Rolana and heading towards the castle.
[239:48.59]Could you please not tell me any more updates?
[239:50.55]You're going to get me so fucked up.
[239:52.97]I'm going to think you're right behind me.
[239:54.69]Hey, update.
[239:55.75]I am at Messmer's door.
[239:57.07]Freddy Dredd?
[240:02.35]Oh, Freddy Dredd was here.
[240:04.91]Freddy Dredd.
[240:05.91]Everybody loves Freddy Dredd.
[240:06.89]Come on.
[240:08.25]What's up, Freddy?
[240:12.91]Yeah, I don't know.
[240:13.47]I like Johnny Joy.
[240:17.13]I want you to take back what you said earlier about Vaddy.
[240:21.77]What did I say?
[240:22.59]Wait, I don't think I said anything bad.
[240:24.49]You said that I wasn't learning anything good or a thing.
[240:28.73]You said I wasn't learning anything.
[240:31.21]I've seen that video.
[240:33.92]you've seen all that you've you talk about that channel you like drop that channel don't let him fool you well I I that's what I want to clarify I said I didn't learn anything because I've already seen it and the the rules were watch the latest one and I watched the latest one and chat's like well if you had it on speed how did you even learn it well I learned it before
[240:53.87]It wasn't to learn.
[240:54.59]It was to give three facts, and I did.
[240:56.05]Honestly, half of these are just total, complete dog shit.
[241:00.63]So it doesn't matter.
[241:01.93]It's just for fun.
[241:04.63]It's just for fun.
[241:05.45]We're just having fun.
[241:07.37]Did you have fun?
[241:09.03]Yeah.
[241:09.31]Are you continuing to have fun?
[241:11.38]I'm continuing to have fun.
[241:13.36]I'm just a little worried about... I've been on autopilot the whole time, and I miraculously have found my way over here.
[241:22.19]I feel like out of nowhere, you filled up half the board.
[241:24.99]Like it was really bad for you and we chatted and then I went and did my own thing and you had like half the board.
[241:32.47]Um, you could say I really.
[241:39.30]Why didn't you just take the goat for a space?
[241:42.60]Like you had planned.
[241:48.04]Dude, I got you.
[241:51.52]I guess.
[241:53.34]uh something bad just happened to me yeah I'm seeing a lot of mega lols per minute are indicating that you're not doing so good hey guys so that I'm on the same page of what's happening if if Jerma does something good can we do like I don't know cat jam oh you have the chat open too because they're helping you as well that's right yeah I'm seeing that things may not be going well not right there no
[242:29.36]If I get to a boss, you better believe I need to lock in and he's going to sit here and start.
[242:34.14]He's going to make a bunch of sound effects.
[242:36.98]Oh, so like when I was fighting Verlana and my entire chat wasn't spamming like text-to-speech read-alouds of like the Path of Exile campaign plot.
[242:47.11]That was a choice for you to have on your stream.
[242:51.89]You could have disabled it for that moment.
[242:53.97]Well, it was a choice to have me in your life.
[242:56.49]How's it going?
[242:59.34]Actually, kind of good.
[243:01.42]I think you've been a net positive on my life.
[243:03.64]I think so.
[243:05.02]That's where I aim to be.
[243:06.10]Like a couple of points above neutral.
[243:08.12]No, I think it's more than that.
[243:10.40]Well, I'm saying that's where I aim.
[243:11.66]Like if I've overshot, like that's great.
[243:16.04]But I would like to stay net neutral.
[243:18.54]A little bit above.
[243:23.48]I think I forget where to go.
[243:27.20]Yeah, me too.
[243:27.66]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[243:29.58]I just got to the Hippo, but I don't think you have... Do you have to fight the Hippo to do both of these?
[243:35.96]I think... No, you do not.
[243:38.12]I'm going to give you your hand here.
[243:39.45]Chat was telling me there was a bony village.
[243:42.37]You do not.
[243:44.23]There is another way to get into the castle.
[243:56.07]You better not.
[243:56.69]Not when I'm right here.
[243:58.85]Uh, yeah.
[244:07.23]That's correct.
[244:08.19]You have to go through that, like, Bonnie Village area.
[244:11.07]You're correct.
[244:13.13]I want you to know where you're going.
[244:16.86]Yeah, I have a general idea.
[244:33.65]That's not safe?
[244:34.99]I thought it was safe.
[244:37.27]I don't even know why I jumped.
[244:39.85]Well, I'm fine.
[244:40.75]Okay, I need to go... Where the hell do I go?
[244:59.92]What was your weapon, by the way?
[245:01.12]The Smith's Ripped Hammer.
[245:05.55]Oh, you're a wild style.
[245:08.19]I was throwing some shit around.
[245:09.71]I wish I could see my map.
[245:13.39]It's like... I know you take...
[245:26.96]Okay, is it cheating if I'm looking at a video that is explaining a speedrun skipped into Bunny Village?
[245:32.53]No.
[245:33.73]No, you're alright.
[245:35.19]Okay.
[245:36.61]I don't even know if I can do this.
[245:51.14]I don't know where to go!
[245:56.26]Why is my game a thousand times louder now?
[246:00.08]Oh, I know why.
[246:00.74]I'll fix it.
[246:04.42]I turned it up at Millenium.
[246:15.59]That's better.
[246:25.56]Where the hell am I going?
[246:27.66]I see.
[246:31.70]Oh, there we go.
[246:34.81]He looks really evil today.
[246:35.83]Well, what do you want me to tell you?
[246:40.15]Okay.
[246:54.00]I am about to fight a boss.
[246:55.92]I'm not going to tell you which one.
[247:04.21]You look like Malfoyle.
[247:05.45]Wait, you got to one of them?
[247:09.35]I may have.
[247:13.06]I may have.
[247:14.48]I mean, I can just... I've got all the time in the world to just, like, look.
[247:20.28]You could just look.
[247:25.62]uh your chat is looking for an update they want an update my update is I was trying to do a speedrun skip to bony village and I died that's pretty good that's a pretty good update right this is this is gonna be a Messmer type game I might as well get the reps in by the way
[247:51.62]I'm going to do some... I'm going to just talk to my chat for a second here without talking.
[247:56.65]Yeah.
[248:04.49]You understand?
[248:11.00]Alright, I am having some fun.
[248:17.64]I bet you are.
[248:24.63]Come on.
[249:28.65]Oh, my finger slipped.
[249:49.27]Whoo!
[249:51.09]Nope.
[250:19.40]Falling apart now.
[250:23.15]Falling apart.
[250:45.25]Alright, I got it.
[250:50.74]I'm going to be so quiet now.
[251:06.79]I have accomplished something.
[251:10.40]You've accomplished something.
[251:13.24]I killed the hippo.
[251:44.40]That saves a lot of time.
[251:45.54]It seems to shortcut to get there.
[252:47.73]Stop!
[253:12.87]Come on, man!
[253:31.49]Oh, my God, you're fucking killing me right now.
[254:09.16]Where is his head?
[254:37.86]Ah!
[255:18.93]Fuck!
[255:24.99]I keep following the same fucking move, I know.
[255:45.13]I don't even know where to get that move that everyone is spamming in the chat.
[255:48.25]I have no idea where you get it.
[255:51.64]Can I just go?
[255:53.64]Wait, wait, wait, Esther.
[255:54.60]We need an update from you.
[255:56.46]Yeah, how are you doing?
[255:58.94]I'm in the storehouse specimen storehouse.
[256:01.03]I don't really know where I'm going.
[256:07.27]This whole area is a blur.
[256:09.09]Yeah, it is.
[256:09.97]But I think from here you can even go down to the Skado tree.
[256:14.77]I think so.
[256:17.83]But I'm not too clear on how that pathing works.
[256:25.56]So I think it's onwards and upwards.
[256:34.46]Which one is even better?
[256:35.64]Probably this one.
[256:38.38]actually no hey I'm having I'm having trouble trying to get to where I'm going to I thought uh for me the sunflower felt like the easiest boss in the whole thing sunflower boss is easy it's just it's just like every other boss in this game you just gotta some of the bosses do like
[257:04.88]You know, it's like, here comes a swing.
[257:07.02]And then the other one's a little bit later than you think it is.
[257:09.04]I mean, it also doesn't help us.
[257:14.02]We're good.
[257:14.68]We got it.
[257:15.10]I don't know, dude.
[257:19.75]It sounds like you're not going to be able to do this.
[257:21.41]I don't know.
[257:39.20]I mean, at this rate, you're going to get to Messmer before I can even find him.
[258:03.39]Stamina is what I need.
[258:29.56]Oh shit, he was a little closer.
[258:39.53]Dammit.
[258:59.64]Oh, my God.
[259:57.73]This is the hard part right here, honestly.
[261:06.23]Avatar is dead.
[261:11.16]Now one of us just has to kill Messmer.
[261:15.66]Find him.
[261:18.98]I ran all the way to the Green Hill Zone by accident.
[261:21.82]I didn't even know you could get there without fighting Messmer.
[261:24.83]Who is going to kill Messmer?
[261:26.61]I don't know who's going to actually beat this.
[261:32.03]That's my favorite boss in the game.
[261:34.41]It's that one.
[261:36.53]I also like the Divine Beast.
[261:41.03]I think Divine Beast is my favorite.
[261:43.08]Next to...
[261:46.71]um honestly yeah probably avatar and divine beast honestly yeah well my favorite's Messmer is it actually yeah dale is really cool too what in the the throne room lister the tormentor
[262:20.39]Pretty good.
[262:21.19]Okay.
[262:22.35]This is where we both are going to have a really bad time.
[262:32.87]Why?
[262:33.11]Wait, why?
[262:34.05]I hope people realize that for the remainder of the stream, whoever kills Messmer wins.
[262:43.08]I can't believe it's this close after how it started.
[262:45.86]Honestly, I am shocked that we're here.
[262:49.84]This has been crazy.
[262:53.06]And we didn't plan any of this, honestly.
[262:54.60]Like, it was just... This was not like, oh, yeah, let's make sure we have it beat mesmers, the last thing we do.
[262:59.81]No, this is just kind of crazy how it worked out this way.
[263:02.85]Is this, like, one of the only...
[263:05.13]the the avatar and Messmer are the only two bosses on like both of our bingo sheets from even the last time we played I know honestly it really is like only two names
[263:20.64]Okay.
[263:22.54]Well, good luck to me.
[263:23.54]Yeah, I'll take it off.
[263:26.25]Before I... I gotta find... I'm not fighting anybody.
[263:30.39]I'm here just to run around and look for Messmer's room.
[263:33.13]Which I think I... If I can get to the storeroom, I think I know where to go.
[263:38.33]Good luck.
[263:39.02]This is gonna be so awful for everybody watching.
[263:41.08]No, they're gonna love it.
[263:44.02]Content.
[263:44.22]Content.
[263:44.78]Content.
[263:46.74]I don't think I can get there from here.
[263:51.52]I mean, I'm running in circles in the storeroom at this point.
[263:58.56]Can I get there through here?
[264:07.00]I might have to start from the other one.
[264:20.85]You can get there this way?
[264:23.09]Oh my god.
[264:28.12]I didn't even know it was physically possible to die right there.
[264:42.45]I found the right way but I jumped and my front toe slipped and I fell all the way down to the bottom again.
[264:48.66]happens I was like I was on it you know what I mean I was on one alright be honest you thought you were gonna win I thought I thought you were gonna win when you claimed um the least fall deaths I was like that's it it's over that's my only way I can go
[265:11.58]I was very confident.
[265:13.14]Like, I almost didn't want to win so fast because I knew I was collecting bugs and I knew I was going to beat you on bugs.
[265:19.54]And I think whatever the row of bugs was, I was like, I got that easy.
[265:23.75]Well, I mean, I was going to until I couldn't kill Rolana.
[265:26.27]I had like 20 minutes before you even tried it.
[265:29.47]How bad did you rage?
[265:30.99]Dude, I was raging earlier.
[265:33.51]I reset so many times because I walked in and my chat was like, oh, your eyes looked up and down.
[265:39.28]That was emotion.
[265:41.20]Oh, you got called out from... I got called out once or twice.
[265:43.78]I was desperately, desperately trying to make absolutely no faces, though.
[265:53.32]I don't want to leave any room for debate.
[265:58.57]Absolute bug munchers?
[266:02.63]Okay, so how the do you get in here?
[266:07.69]I think it's this way.
[266:12.96]I'm almost there, I think.
[266:29.50]In the embrace of Messmer's flame.
[266:33.25]Though stripped of the Grace of gold shall all meet death.
[266:36.95]In the embrace of Messmer's flame.
[267:03.75]Who did you kill blindfolded?
[267:06.39]I did exactly what you did when I did Margit.
[267:08.87]Oh yeah.
[267:10.43]But it took me like four tries.
[267:11.76]I walked off three times.
[267:15.12]So you win again.
[267:16.26]You got him first try and they won't let me forget it.
[267:19.93]Looks like you're the bigger man again.
[267:21.81]Looks like you're going to have to just like dumb me.
[267:24.70]Don't you know...
[267:28.53]Don't you know that the reason why that's happening is because they're just piling on top of you to make it because you're like so good at so many things.
[267:39.08]They're just piling on top.
[267:40.60]And I like don't ever win.
[267:42.16]So people are like, oh, yeah, we got to like Jerma.
[267:44.04]Like, you can't even kill the bug, dude.
[267:46.58]You know what?
[267:48.88]Every time there's been like a Souls game.
[267:52.75]um I don't know I I feel like you have consistently always been better than me at them I don't know I don't know about that honest to goodness really I think where all your gamer energy like comes out and then you're like okay you're not like insane I'm not saying you're like a souls master but I'm saying you step it up for a souls game compared to your your other endeavors
[268:25.11]I heard we were going to get a Demon's Souls remake playthrough.
[268:27.75]Somebody said that to me at some point.
[268:31.21]You said you're going to send me a PS5.
[268:34.54]I was serious.
[268:35.26]Do you need a PS5?
[268:37.16]If you send me the PS5, I'll stream it.
[268:39.46]Okay.
[268:42.82]I believe we talked about this, but I don't think you realized that I was genuine.
[268:47.00]Okay.
[268:56.93]Oh, get fucking dominated!
[268:58.97]Maybe I'll get with the PS5.
[269:10.93]chat says rich streamer it's not about that it's that he's not using it because there are no games on a ps5 and he's already beaten Demon's Souls and I haven't I might I honestly could just send you the one that I use you can hey you might get my ps5 with all your files on it
[269:28.89]I do.
[269:29.13]I got a lot of crazy.
[269:30.26]I have like a thousand fucking clips.
[269:33.00]Don't watch them because they're like there for me and for me to show the strength.
[269:38.36]I thought you had like one you like.
[269:41.09]I don't know because you watch everything on.
[269:44.69]I thought you did everything on Xbox.
[269:46.67]Maybe I'm just remembering wrong.
[269:47.93]It depends.
[269:48.33]It depends on what it is.
[269:48.99]Alright, I. Think this is correct.
[270:01.70]Wait, no, no, no, no, no, it's not.
[270:04.05]It's down there.
[270:04.85]And then... It's down again.
[270:15.18]No, it's not.
[270:16.26]Wait, no, no, no.
[270:16.80]I think it's just on the corner now.
[270:19.04]If a bat kills me, I'm gonna...
[270:24.16]You got to do it.
[270:25.66]Whatever you're going to do, you got to do it now.
[270:42.21]I feel like this is what happens when you show an old lady an R-rated movie.
[270:46.70]Oh.
[270:48.26]Oh.
[270:48.56]There's blood in this, Jeremy.
[270:51.36]There's blood in this.
[270:57.81]Am I even going the right way?
[270:58.67]Chat, help me.
[271:00.27]Am I going the right way?
[271:10.32]Sort of.
[271:11.32]Oh, boy.
[271:12.04]That doesn't help.
[271:16.38]No, it's outside.
[271:18.42]It's outside, like, around the edge of the building.
[271:23.40]I remember.
[271:24.21]It's like a little wraparound.
[271:28.81]It's not down there.
[271:30.36]Where is it?
[271:33.42]Please don't tell him.
[271:34.50]Tell me.
[271:36.18]I'm not even that far ahead of you.
[271:38.46]Tell me.
[271:38.98]Help.
[271:42.42]Not this way.
[271:43.20]Gotta go up top.
[271:47.52]Wrong way.
[271:48.54]You had it.
[271:53.58]You have to go down.
[271:55.84]One person just said that and I don't think they're lying.
[272:01.15]Oh no, I am.
[272:03.86]Equally lost.
[272:07.88]No, no, no, no.
[272:10.77]Wrong.
[272:12.37]God.
[272:17.83]Chat, you are, all of you are aware that there's like a five second delay from what I see on my screen to what you view on your stream.
[272:25.80]So when you say turn around, I may have turned around already.
[272:30.08]You need to give me coordinates.
[272:40.95]Don't.
[272:46.59]Do not tell him the longitude.
[272:48.47]He is one longitude away from winning.
[272:50.21]Oh, look.
[272:55.45]I found a Grace.
[273:06.44]Shit, I need another one.
[273:10.42]Turn left when you see the McDonald's.
[273:13.70]Alright.
[273:15.48]You have to go up this way.
[273:17.96]I actually kind of remember this part.
[273:20.16]Okay, coming from this direction, I know where to go.
[273:23.10]Isn't that crazy?
[273:23.98]What's crazy is you had to kill a whole boss before I got here.
[273:36.41]I just got to Messmer's door.
[273:42.20]Bro, I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[274:09.48]No, don't do this right now.
[274:12.04]I am so locked in.
[274:17.90]Okay.
[274:27.69]It's coming back to me a little bit.
[274:37.48]And then it's like behind me over there.
[274:42.74]I don't know, dude.
[274:44.48]I don't know, dude.
[274:51.31]Oh, I gotta pull the lever.
[274:53.11]I don't even know where the lever is.
[274:54.13]I have no idea where the lever is.
[275:25.54]Can we vote this worst area ever in a FromSoftware game?
[275:29.39]Nope.
[275:30.07]No.
[275:32.33]I don't know what it is, but it can't be this.
[275:34.81]It's this.
[275:44.68]not uh Dark Souls to scholar the first sin where they all shoot projectiles at you when you walk through that like shrine of amana no I don't even care that just run through it and scholar you can I I just run through that I don't even fight anything
[276:08.23]Oh wait, the Dark Souls 2 snow area.
[276:11.09]The DLC area was unbelievably unbearable.
[276:14.96]It was unbearable.
[276:20.88]OK, so then now I have to go back up.
[276:27.20]274.
[276:27.72]Painted World, yeah.
[276:36.36]OK.
[276:47.57]Dude, I hate this place.
[276:49.29]I hate this place.
[276:50.89]I fucking hate this place.
[276:55.32]There's stairs and books and stairs and books and stairs and books and stairs and books and stairs and books and stairs and books.
[277:11.61]Dude, why am I trying to skip this?
[277:13.75]It's just like I'm so lazy.
[277:19.49]I'm so lazy.
[277:21.13]I'm so lazy.
[277:21.97]I can't stop it.
[277:23.77]I'm so lazy.
[277:25.05]I just can't walk down those stairs.
[277:27.45]I can't do it.
[277:28.35]I hate it.
[277:28.91]I can't.
[277:30.06]I can't stop it.
[277:33.36]I'm telling you I can't stop.
[277:34.56]I have to.
[277:35.10]I can't do it.
[277:41.62]You deserve it.
[277:42.52]I deserve to lose.
[277:43.16]Yeah.
[277:43.85]Because, like, I just don't.
[277:46.11]And I'm going to miss this.
[277:46.79]Watch.
[277:47.01]Oh, yeah.
[277:52.41]He's just over there grinding Messmer right now, silent.
[277:55.07]He's going to win in 10 seconds.
[277:56.69]Where do I go from here?
[277:59.37]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[278:28.86]Oh shit.
[278:34.84]Wait, I don't even, do I, I don't fight this?
[278:36.20]I don't know.
[278:52.90]I know, I know, I know, you, I'm doing something very, very specific.
[278:57.53]I want enough room to do the animation and not get killed by the Fire Knight.
[279:06.53]You see what I'm talking about?
[279:07.31]I need to open the door now.
[279:09.88]And... Open it, dude.
[279:21.74]I needed it.
[279:23.66]Oh, he's right here.
[279:31.97]And I got that sneaky little fragment, which is going to put me at a good spot.
[279:37.10]Alright, Ster.
[279:38.64]We're both at Messmer.
[279:41.06]Yeah, it's not going good.
[279:42.40]I don't think it's going to go good for me either.
[279:44.08]What am I drinking?
[279:47.22]Just water.
[279:53.19]I have to change the affinity of my weapon.
[280:00.15]I don't think I'm gonna skip the cutscene.
[280:01.92]I think I'm gonna watch it because, like, I got some time to chill.
[280:05.16]I don't think Ster's gonna beat this in, like, the next hour.
[280:13.32]So if I chill and, like, relax for a minute and then come to it, because he's stressed.
[280:18.89]Yeah, just, yeah, no, no, waste time is a good strategy.
[280:23.02]Well, I'm not wasting time.
[280:24.40]I am self-mediating.
[280:27.50]I am self-meditating.
[280:28.58]My favorite line.
[280:30.60]And he said it so perfectly.
[280:59.09]He says it the same way every time.
[281:03.29]He said it first because it's from him.
[281:30.45]That's it.
[281:58.63]Yikes.
[282:43.89]Shit!
[282:44.45]Oh, I almost had him face too.
[282:51.11]I know, I gotta change the weapon.
[282:52.37]That was a good first try though.
[283:08.82]Take that weapon infinity off and I will devour him.
[283:12.23]Oh no.
[283:12.71]I think I got this.
[283:35.25]change affinities at the Grace can you I thought don't you have to unlock it oh I guess I could alright I'm walking in I should be unlocked
[284:07.41]I mistimed it.
[284:11.51]That grab, it's very long and I drank at a bad time.
[284:19.20]Okay.
[284:24.50]Walking in.
[284:26.38]Best part is it's right here and one of us is going to do this eventually.
[284:33.33]I'm doing so bad.
[285:00.17]Fuck.
[285:00.83]That first attempt.
[285:01.57]It's always the first attempt.
[285:02.83]It really is.
[285:05.53]I gotta put my headphones in.
[285:06.77]I can't hear anything.
[285:07.57]It feels like I'm underwater.
[285:09.61]They weren't even in.
[285:10.23]It feels like I've been in a tin can.
[285:12.27]Now I can hear.
[285:12.99]Lock in.
[285:13.81]Lock in.
[285:47.40]It was not the one.
[285:56.09]Wasn't meant to be.
[285:59.89]Do you think we're going to beat this before one of us has to turn the stream off?
[286:04.41]Well, you already did.
[286:05.55]What, your mom's gonna call you?
[286:07.05]I said before one of us has to turn the stream off.
[286:09.53]I can't hear him underwater.
[286:12.55]Yeah, I did.
[286:13.15]I did have to turn the stream on.
[286:17.75]That little delay is so awful.
[286:24.67]All the delays are driving me fucking crazy.
[286:41.82]Fuck, it takes so long for him to swing his fucking weapon.
[286:46.01]He's old.
[286:52.15]And then sometimes he like... Oh, it's scraping the ground for two seconds.
[286:59.74]Get that fucking out of here.
[287:19.30]What the hell are you talking about, game?
[287:46.39]You know what's so funny?
[287:48.94]This is my least favorite boss in the whole game.
[287:52.94]Why is that?
[287:54.78]I just think he's too slow.
[287:57.50]That's why he's like the only boss you can react to.
[288:00.76]No.
[288:03.26]No.
[288:08.98]For how like flashy he is, he deceptively like just, he shows everything he's gonna do.
[288:14.21]I think this is the worst boss in the game.
[288:16.32]Whoa.
[288:21.22]It actually is not, by the way.
[288:23.29]Whoa.
[288:24.67]Who's the worst in the DLC?
[288:27.03]Who's the worst in the DLC?
[288:28.95]Yeah.
[288:29.55]Rillanna.
[288:33.51]Really?
[288:35.21]I hate Rillanna.
[288:35.88]I think it's the worst fight ever.
[288:40.34]Cavalry Knight guy.
[288:43.90]I actually didn't hate that one that much.
[288:47.82]Alright, I gotta lock in.
[289:00.01]Doesn't he do another one?
[289:04.83]I gotta take these out.
[289:08.49]It's like, drives me insane putting both headphones in.
[289:16.23]The Mikalafite?
[289:17.29]The Mikalafite is just, you can just cheese it.
[289:31.75]Oh my god, that damage was so awful.
[289:33.91]Oh my god, I died.
[289:36.13]Fucking one hit, two hits.
[289:37.01]How many fragments do you have right now?
[289:45.07]um I think six yeah me too so
[290:23.08]Oh, this is the worst boss to fight after doing this for five hours.
[290:27.94]True.
[290:28.48]Actually, no.
[290:31.08]You played through the... You stressed out about all the weird shit we're doing in Elden Ring.
[290:37.17]Now do this.
[291:15.15]Oh!
[291:19.54]Oh, that little delay on the swing, I thought I had it.
[291:27.58]Well, I mean, dude, it seems like we have time to go get, like, 30 Skadootry fragments.
[291:32.65]Why are we even fighting them with five?
[291:35.17]What the hell are we doing?
[291:38.76]If you want to go take a lap... I actually just might go do that.
[291:48.03]You're welcome to it.
[291:56.87]It's so funny, my chat is only doing the, like, Crypt of the Grace of Gold thing, because it's the only thing they've been seeing.
[292:02.80]It's been that animation, and then I die, I come back, he does the same thing.
[292:07.90]There's no time for them to even say anything else.
[292:13.58]Checked out.
[292:17.85]I'm starting to get it.
[292:18.83]I'm starting to remember the timings.
[292:22.09]I'm getting it, but I want to fucking eat food.
[292:41.30]Sounds like code for please beat him.
[292:43.94]I really hope you just win.
[292:45.88]We'll be here.
[292:46.20]We're gonna be for like three hours if you don't.
[292:51.44]I think I'm getting pretty close.
[292:53.60]I hope you just win.
[293:03.02]I gotta lock in.
[293:04.74]I locked in on the first attempt and then all the fucking gas left my body.
[293:08.90]I'm done.
[293:09.60]I'm toast.
[293:19.73]You know what's funny is I'm not even playing right now.
[293:22.63]What?
[293:23.39]You're not playing?
[293:24.73]What do you mean you're not playing right now?
[293:26.81]What are you talking about?
[293:28.09]I haven't been playing the whole time.
[293:29.79]What?
[293:30.85]No, you liar.
[293:32.23]What?
[293:32.57]I've been playing against nobody?
[293:39.99]playing okay to be clear I'm playing I just thought that was funny that I would like make you sit here and do this and you're like man I hope he wins like this is gonna be hard to be here for hours and I'm like having a bowl of ice cream watching your stream I wish you weren't lying I feel like you probably did do that alright this is the one right here I guarantee it
[294:12.46]guys if you think it's going to be this stream that beats Messmer
[294:33.95]without like any fucking items well if it's gonna be a stream it's gonna be yours if you want me to fight Vesper with five skidoo fragments with a fucking goofy hammer and and not even 14 flasks moon moon did it
[295:00.20]Moonmoon did it.
[295:10.50]Moonmoon was rune level one.
[295:14.91]God, look at how terrible I look compared to the fucking greatest gamer.
[295:19.21]The god gamer himself.
[295:24.05]In fact, I'm disgusted with myself for even saying his name in Vanduul.
[295:34.21]Shit, I can't do this.
[295:41.93]Somebody said, you are glazing him right now.
[295:44.48]In the embrace of Messmer's flame.
[295:57.77]alright do you think open up my stream and give me some pointers okay I mean I've just been sitting here you fucking eating ice cream
[296:21.66]Fuck this guy!
[296:22.65]And fuck his... When I jump in the air, I don't get to sit there for five seconds, by the way.
[296:27.87]I'm a normal human.
[296:31.11]You're not.
[296:31.77]You're like the chosen, tarnished one.
[296:48.33]And by chosen, I mean kind of just like the random one that does it.
[297:06.68]Bros dying in two hits?
[297:11.43]Because you're supposed to have like 15 skidoo fragments at this motherfucker.
[297:15.93]I have five or six.
[297:18.04]My first phase two.
[297:20.03]Good.
[297:20.45]Please just beat him.
[297:21.79]Can you just lie and say you won?
[297:25.21]Just take a screenshot from somebody that randomly like killed him somewhere.
[297:29.17]There's a facecam on the stream.
[297:31.53]Someone else is there playing.
[297:35.17]Yeah, I got him.
[297:37.35]I actually got him like 25%.
[297:38.15]It's getting there, dude.
[297:45.70]I think I got this.
[297:55.44]Thank you.
[298:31.18]I'm dodging all the stuff I'm feeling it stop no more talking
[299:08.97]I had no stamina.
[299:10.01]I had false stamina.
[299:10.97]I don't know what happened, but I hate this game.
[299:12.73]I don't know what happened, but I hate this game.
[299:15.81]This is literally the worst game ever.
[299:16.85]This is the worst boss in any FromSoftware game.
[299:18.55]This is the worst FromSoftware game.
[299:20.24]This is worse than Dark Souls 2 Demake.
[299:24.18]Dark Souls 2 Demake is better than this.
[299:26.14]Elden Ring is not game of the year.
[299:27.34]It's game of the century.
[299:36.88]I stunned him.
[299:38.54]I'm shunning him.
[299:39.62]I dodged everything.
[299:40.49]I stunned him phase two.
[299:41.69]I'm dead.
[300:00.03]I'm dead.
[300:48.51]Oh, it's so long!
[301:27.42]Fuck you!
[301:28.24]It's an extra 10 seconds!
[301:43.13]that last swing is just like I'm getting closer though people are saying I should summon you and whoever gets the last hit wins
[302:06.19]That's actually pretty funny.
[302:07.83]Oh, I don't... Dude, you think we're not going to be able to kill him?
[302:12.82]Do you want me to summon you?
[302:15.92]I want to get this.
[302:17.38]I'm so close.
[302:18.60]I'm still alive.
[302:21.20]How am I still... What?
[302:25.06]This is shocking.
[302:26.84]Oh.
[303:20.31]God dammit, he just never stops fucking swinging.
[303:24.35]Can you please do phase two?
[303:31.24]Bro, this is hard mode.
[303:32.44]And you know what?
[303:33.22]I'm actually very proud of myself.
[303:35.90]I would normally be here with 40 Skadoo tree fragments.
[303:41.67]With three summons.
[303:44.49]And I would eat a bowl of ice cream.
[303:51.15]That hitbox lasts a full week.
[303:57.15]In the embrace of Messmer's flame.
[304:00.94]Ster's going to beat it, and then I can just hit the end stream button the second I hear I won.
[304:07.75]That you... Wait, I'm going to beat it, and you're going to end stream when you hear that you win.
[304:11.61]No, that you win.
[304:13.61]You've got to use those words.
[304:15.18]Oh.
[304:22.78]It's going to get me every single time.
[304:24.40]My brain will never, ever, ever be able to dodge it.
[304:27.69]And I mean, ever.
[304:30.23]Ever.
[304:33.11]What are you using for a weapon?
[304:35.61]Zamor sword.
[304:37.33]Zamor sword.
[304:39.51]It's the ice circle one that you get pretty early from a jail.
[304:45.48]I have to wait for the believers.
[304:46.58]I am not in a position to beat Messmer right now, but I'll try.
[305:15.70]I even waited, like, a full half second longer.
[305:20.47]Dude, I'll beat Divine Beast Dancing Lion with, like, fucking eyes closed at, like, one fragment.
[305:26.39]But, like, I cannot fight this guy.
[305:28.41]Under any circumstance.
[305:38.18]You doubt it?
[305:38.90]I did it an hour ago!
[305:41.72]I already did it!
[305:42.22]What the hell just happened?
[306:03.03]10% HP, dude.
[306:04.57]Please just kill him.
[306:05.43]Please, for the love of God, kill him.
[306:07.33]I've died.
[306:07.93]I would love to kill him.
[306:10.47]There's so many variants of the coffee pasta.
[306:20.28]Just get fragments, dude.
[306:21.76]In the time it's going to take me to run around for like 40 minutes to go collect fragments.
[306:27.60]He's going to beat him.
[306:36.88]Ugh!
[306:38.26]I hate it!
[307:02.79]What is happening?
[307:37.00]You beat him yet?
[307:50.37]You're so desperate!
[307:53.83]Dude, I'm gonna go get the ice cream and just... I'm gonna get the ice cream and just... You can just do like a play.
[307:58.43]Just speak what you're doing.
[308:04.49]At this point, I don't know.
[308:10.14]Where is he even swinging?
[308:22.08]Glad I picked the fucking hammer that I threw seven times in seven hours.
[308:31.87]There's a lot of fun DLC weapons that you will never get to use the ability the whole DLC.
[308:36.13]If anybody matters.
[308:41.63]Oh my God, he delays every attack.
[308:45.00]In the embrace of Messmer's flame.
[308:56.76]If every attack is delayed, are any of them delayed?
[308:59.16]Yeah.
[309:02.83]Yeah, they are.
[309:06.93]This dude's got a snake on him.
[309:09.29]Why are you moving so slow?
[309:11.71]Snakes are like... Not snakes.
[309:17.43]The snakes are chilling under the heat lamp, not moving 99% of the time.
[309:24.20]This guy's flames are just the heat lamp.
[309:40.46]Oh my God.
[309:41.68]And that move is delayed.
[309:46.35]Yeah, I know, dude.
[310:18.38]Dude.
[310:21.36]I'm so mad at this.
[310:25.01]Every time he drops that fucking spear, I'm going to just close my eyes.
[310:31.23]Delay your attacks too.
[310:32.87]Okay.
[310:33.81]I'm going to delay all of my stuff.
[310:42.09]You piece of shit.
[311:11.98]Is Elden Ring getting us?
[311:16.78]Yeah, I can hear you, but I saw your stream.
[311:22.19]I had to like disconnect image for a sec.
[311:36.27]Normal for me to have internet problems.
[311:44.57]We're good?
[312:04.53]It's so slow and then it's so quick.
[312:27.60]It's not abnormal for me to have internet problems.
[312:32.98]Sometimes it just happens around like 8, 9 o'clock.
[312:38.74]I'd rather just watch TV than do this.
[312:42.75]you still hear me start yeah yeah okay do you want me to just oh oh I killed him he's dead somebody just said this is my TV what he's dead dude no are you serious no I'm just saying things apparently you want to hear
[313:09.82]Also, keep in mind, we're like level 110.
[313:12.20]Aren't you supposed to be like 160 at this height?
[313:15.34]Like 150?
[313:15.60]I have no idea.
[313:16.30]I think so.
[313:16.52]100, greater than 150.
[313:35.76]Just go somewhere else.
[313:38.07]Unfortunately, we are both on this.
[313:41.53]This is the last possible bingo square.
[313:45.46]We should have just made this fart into a fucking lighter, dude.
[313:47.94]Why would we put Messmer on here?
[313:51.16]Why did we put Messmer on this thing?
[313:54.84]I think I asked it to be here.
[313:58.37]I said, isn't the whole point of an Elden Ring stream to play Elden Ring and we could have at least one real boss fight on the list?
[314:05.31]That's true.
[314:05.97]And then we added Messmer.
[314:09.92]And now we're both just stuck here forever.
[314:27.48]I'm like sweating.
[314:28.68]I haven't eaten.
[314:31.06]There's no way I beat him right now.
[314:32.95]It's not going to come down to you.
[314:34.47]Congratulations on Elden Ring Bingo.
[314:37.67]Nice job.
[314:38.83]You did it.
[314:39.99]You got him to 10%?
[314:41.23]I got him to like 36%.
[314:47.54]that wait that would imply you got phase two well like 36 percent health removed yeah that's why do you swing weirdly sometimes in the embrace of Messmer's flame
[315:18.66]uh let's do it together screw this let me just you know the reason my stream is off because my internet isn't working oh right his internet doesn't work never mind hey some people take like five some people take like weeks you get me in here with 12 to 15 screw fragments level 150.
[315:47.48]This motherfucker's dead.
[315:48.26]I've killed him already.
[315:49.62]I beat this game.
[315:51.00]I beat the game, obviously.
[315:53.46]You give me that shit, and not at the bingo stuff, and he's dead.
[315:58.78]How are you on Discord?
[316:04.05]That's true.
[316:06.43]I don't know.
[316:07.73]Discord takes, like, the no internet.
[316:09.51]I'm sure, like, dodging attacks, I'm not going to, like, be rubberbanding around a video game Connecto thing.
[316:16.02]I'm offline mode.
[316:21.52]so so
[317:18.66]No!
[317:31.88]What the hell am I doing?
[317:53.73]That was a smart face too.
[318:00.94]God damn it, dude.
[318:02.54]What the fuck?
[318:03.58]I just had no time to drink.
[318:04.84]That was the Half-Life 2 death sound.
[318:32.63]I don't think I I I cannot dodge it okay I could dodge it I could dodge it if I like you know I wanted to okay when you get you know like when you're screaming and like the screaming curse because you are like 40 worse at every single thing you do yeah do you get that you understand that yeah you feel that way too right
[318:51.30]Yeah, no, I've demonstrated this on many occasions.
[318:58.43]It might even be 50%, honestly.
[319:09.03]It's called Pope?
[319:09.99]No, this is a documented phenomenon.
[319:13.34]The streamer tax?
[319:15.60]Yeah.
[319:16.86]For some reason, you are just like 90% unavailable to do anything.
[319:21.62]You have 10% brainpower for everything else besides like streaming.
[319:26.68]For me, it's more like 4% brainpower.
[319:30.61]And I need those extra neurons, okay?
[319:32.35]Okay.
[319:59.13]I thought that was the end of the combo.
[320:06.49]It is never the end of a mesmerist combo.
[320:13.82]By the embrace of mesmerist combo.
[320:23.12]Thank you for watching.
[320:53.95]I can't see anything.
[320:56.96]Your whole string is covered in fire and you can't even see anything.
[321:01.70]I'm not killing him fast enough either.
[321:14.21]Got him!
[321:15.33]Did you actually win?
[321:17.68]Got him.
[321:18.18]Got him.
[321:18.52]Got him.
[321:18.78]Got him.
[321:19.04]Got him.
[321:19.50]Got him.
[321:19.74]Got him.
[321:20.00]Got him.
[321:20.28]Did you just free us?
[321:21.06]This is not a lie.
[321:21.86]This is Demigod.
[321:23.54]This is Demigod Feld.
[321:25.18]This is Demigod Feld.
[321:27.11]Not a false alarm.
[321:29.71]A real alarm.
[321:30.73]I've got the proof is in the pudding.
[321:33.89]I'm setting you free.
[321:35.07]Oh, now watch me do it.
[321:36.29]Watch me do it.
[321:36.77]Watch me do it.
[321:37.49]My turn.
[321:37.85]Okay.
[322:30.68]Fucking hate that move more than anything in the whole game.
[322:55.71]Ah!
[323:35.61]Let's go!
[323:57.09]Oh, my God.
[324:44.72]Fuck no!
[324:45.34]What?
[324:46.07]Wait, what?
[324:47.77]I didn't dodge through that?
[324:50.37]Oh, come on, dude.
[324:51.35]What?
[324:53.73]He like... That was... He like... What was that?
[324:57.29]He like clipped forward and grabbed me.
[325:00.45]What?
[325:00.71]Did you see how far away he was?
[325:03.30]What the fuck?
[325:06.96]Holy shit, he just like came out of nowhere.
[325:10.37]I thought it was going to be absolute cinema.
[325:13.83]It was about to be.
[325:15.07]Oh, I know.
[325:16.17]It's too bad.
[325:16.93]Let me try it one more time.
[325:26.36]This weapon is actually horrible.
[325:28.82]Because if you accidentally press R2, you are... You do this like... I can't use this weapon.
[325:40.25]Dude, if you press R2, even if you don't even mean to, you just... Go in the stash.
[325:45.26]Go in the stash.
[325:45.94]Go in the stash.
[325:47.70]No, I gotta... I just had it right there.
[325:53.32]You're free?
[325:54.20]I know I'm free, but I almost just beat him right there.
[325:56.16]I was waiting for the stagger.
[326:00.10]I just didn't get it.
[326:10.47]God, I fucking hate this game.
[326:45.41]I was waiting so long just because it takes forever.
[326:48.17]This is a bad run.
[327:41.56]Thank you.
[328:33.17]Just put the fries in the bag?
[328:35.09]What do you mean fries in the bag?
[328:39.23]If I stick to it, I will beat him.
[328:43.88]Ster, you won.
[328:45.56]You're free to go.
[328:47.78]Yeah, I'm here for the ride.
[328:50.47]I really think once you get his phase one down, phase two is easier.
[328:54.93]I'd rather him do the snake attacks than any of his like elongated jab.
[328:58.85]I agree.
[329:33.04]That move is his worst combo for me.
[329:35.04]I'm in trouble.
[329:46.57]Ah, it's a hard block.
[329:58.96]I'm dead?
[330:00.40]Holy shit, how did it kill me?
[330:04.55]You go, grab, grab, grab.
[330:06.49]I'm going to do it.
[330:07.35]I'm going to do 10 more attempts and then I'm going to leave.
[330:11.37]I'm going to do it in 10 attempts.
[330:14.72]Messmer has a few attacks that I don't know how you dodge them in like a no hit.
[330:21.76]he like swings I don't know he's just accept that you take like like 10 of your health and damage because he does like a extra backswing sometimes
[330:45.43]This combo is the worst.
[330:47.07]That's the biggest problem I have.
[330:48.45]It'll hit me every time.
[330:49.42]How did I not dodge that?
[330:58.38]One.
[330:58.58]How did I not dodge it?
[330:59.24]That's one.
[331:08.90]I'm turning all my monitors off.
[331:10.24]Like, chat is flying by.
[331:11.52]I'm closing chat.
[331:12.28]I'm closing every window.
[331:13.98]I'm literally just going to play the game.
[331:15.03]Alright, dude, bro, bro.
[331:15.79]I got you, bro.
[331:16.51]Slash ban all.
[331:20.31]They're gone.
[331:21.73]I'm just, I can't see anything.
[331:23.09]I don't, there's no windows.
[331:25.05]There's no like text scrolling in my peripheral right here.
[331:28.58]Wish me luck, chat.
[331:29.28]I got nine attempts.
[331:30.00]I'm going for it right now.
[331:43.24]I tried to jump.
[331:44.10]It didn't work.
[331:48.62]Worst combo.
[331:49.62]Worst combo.
[331:50.70]It hits me every fucking time.
[332:07.36]If it wasn't going to happen on that time when I got him to like 20%, 10%, it's not going to happen now.
[332:43.12]What turn will you fucking turn and fight me instead of like swinging at me from behind your back?
[333:00.01]I'm full tilt.
[333:01.17]It's over.
[333:01.53]I'm full tilt.
[333:03.41]I need to restart.
[333:04.75]It's full tilt.
[333:06.53]It's literally impossible for me to beat him.
[333:10.00]It's full tilt.
[333:13.08]It's over.
[333:16.88]Thanks everybody for watching.
[333:17.80]Appreciate it.
[333:18.92]This has been Elden Ring Bingo.
[333:20.89]You've got more.
[333:23.19]You've got a couple more.
[333:25.85]Chin up, bucko.
[333:27.78]Strap in.
[333:29.16]Fight him with a fucking like random ass hammer.
[333:32.36]I don't even like hammers.
[333:33.40]Why did I pick it?
[333:42.40]Dude, what the fuck?
[333:53.79]I'm sorry.
[334:44.86]Where even is he?
[334:51.42]Is he up there?
[335:00.08]I'm not entirely sure where he is.
[335:02.20]Let me have the camera.
[335:03.93]That sounds fun to me.
[335:13.17]You didn't do him on stream the first time, right?
[335:15.43]No, I didn't.
[335:16.97]Then you beat him first, probably off screen.
[335:19.01]I actually took about 50 or 60 attempts to beat him.
[335:27.74]Honestly, I would rather fight a full health bar phase 2.
[335:42.60]I would rather fight 10 health bar phase 2s than one phase 1.
[335:48.90]No, let's make it 50.
[335:49.70]I'd rather fight 50 phase 2 bars.
[335:53.90]Let's make it 100.
[335:59.50]What number is that one?
[336:01.06]Four?
[336:02.83]Five.
[336:13.49]I'm so tired.
[336:17.80]I'm tired.
[336:18.52]I don't want to fight Messmer with six Spitter Tree Fragments and level 100.
[336:22.40]We're underleveled.
[336:32.78]You know, I don't even give a fuck.
[336:33.86]I'm turning my goofy shit on too.
[336:37.30]No, I can't even turn it on.
[337:09.28]I don't know.
[337:40.81]Oh.
[338:29.90]That was fucking weird, man.
[339:01.95]This one's for the bugs!
[339:55.57]Oh, my God.
[341:01.87]I can't see!
[341:07.85]Whoa!
[341:32.44]I can't do it.
[341:33.64]I can't do it.
[341:35.80]I can't do it.
[341:39.07]I can't do it.
[341:40.31]I can't do it.
[341:41.43]You did it.
[341:42.15]I can't do it.
[341:42.73]You did it.
[341:43.33]You did it.
[341:43.93]I beat him.
[341:44.97]You did it.
[341:50.37]Wow, I did it.
[341:51.31]I can't believe it.
[341:52.13]We both won bingo.
[341:54.31]We both finished at the exact same time on the same square.
[341:57.87]I say that's a draw.
[342:01.25]Oh, that was so hard.
[342:03.27]That's a fun boss.
[342:04.01]I like that one.
[342:05.45]You just said it was the worst.
[342:07.53]That was a lie.
[342:08.41]I have a tier list.
[342:10.79]Oh.
[342:11.27]Messmer is an A boss.
[342:13.27]I think S tier is reserved for Divine Beast.
[342:16.75]I can't even see the chat.
[342:19.83]Oh, I closed the window.
[342:21.67]I actually can't even see them.
[342:23.67]Chat is spamming every single person.
[342:26.43]It's unanimous.
[342:27.45]There is no different message.
[342:28.69]It's like they're all bots.
[342:29.45]They're all saying for the bugs.
[342:36.18]Sometimes you got to do it for the bugs.
[342:39.36]Oh, I closed out of the... Hold on.
[342:41.15]Let me open the bingo.
[342:43.29]Oh, well, we are.
[342:44.53]We know where it is.
[342:49.84]That was for the bugs.
[342:55.48]Hey, you have to, the thing about these games, you have to complain.
[342:58.70]You have to talk about how this is too hard.
[343:01.08]This is, can you believe how they made it like this?
[343:03.54]See how long he floats in the air?
[343:04.74]You have to complain to cope with the fact that you're going to make it eventually.
[343:08.22]I did not think I was going to make it.
[343:13.62]I am surprised I didn't get hit in the last two seconds there.
[343:18.18]But, get it.
[343:20.78]The last like four hits were a scramble.
[343:24.36]Honestly, the animations got all messed up.
[343:27.16]I was just doing it from counting.
[343:30.24]When the snake showed up and like bumped into the wall and then kind of disappeared, I was just like, I think I know when the snake does this shit.
[343:38.12]It's like one, two.
[343:39.88]I was just counting and I knew it was like about two and a half seconds.
[343:45.91]Oh, my God.
[343:46.75]How many people just made points there?
[343:48.91]Oh, my God.
[343:50.27]There was so many doubters.
[343:51.21]It's unbelievable.
[343:56.43]Well, Ster.
[343:59.20]That was the Elden Ring bingo.
[344:02.26]How do you feel?
[344:02.70]You know, I feel good.
[344:04.19]That was fun.
[344:04.73]I think that's a really fun format for for stream.
[344:07.37]It's fun.
[344:11.71]I think I'm really curious.
[344:14.37]I'm upset that I swore more times than you.
[344:17.58]I really wanted to not do that.
[344:20.02]I cannot believe I died from fall damage.
[344:22.66]I couldn't.
[344:25.08]Especially after you saying, don't do it.
[344:27.04]Don't do it.
[344:27.68]It's just like, I'm like a little kid.
[344:32.47]Like, don't do that.
[344:33.79]Don't do that.
[344:35.45]I do it.
[344:36.39]Like, no, don't do it.
[344:37.51]Don't do that.
[344:40.29]Yeah, we did every single square.
[344:45.80]Yeah, didn't expect that.
[344:48.00]Ster gets the W, but in parentheses, we're going to say tie.
[344:52.74]That's Ster, Ster, W, dash, tie.
[345:00.87]No, you like beat, you beat the sunflower and then still got to Messmer at the same time I did.
[345:08.65]like like a 30 second like you were not far behind I did like two attempts and you showed up I was so lost that was crazy it's so funny because there are two ways this stream ends the the stream ends with me at 10 deaths not doing it and and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be so I would be so depressed
[345:36.92]I would be like, alright, guys, see you later.
[345:38.24]Thanks for watching the stream.
[345:39.29]Alright.
[345:40.31]Take it easy, everybody.
[345:41.69]Have a good one.
[345:43.01]End stream.
[345:44.07]And I would just be like, I can't fucking believe I didn't fucking do it.
[345:46.91]I didn't fucking do it.
[345:48.09]How did I?
[345:49.05]Messmer's moves are so fucking annoying.
[345:51.21]Oh, I would have been.
[345:51.74]I would have been like that for like six hours.
[345:55.52]Days.
[345:58.98]I don't know if you're like this too, but when I when I start to go tilt.
[346:04.16]It's like the whole machine is shaking and it's going to take for like a day after the earthquake before I'm going to be able to do anything.
[346:14.65]Yeah.
[346:20.13]I forget.
[346:22.09]I just get, it's so hard for me to like get, when like the train derails for me, it's like, it's so hard to get back on the track because I'm just sitting there like,
[346:33.09]The train, look at the train!
[346:34.11]I, look!
[346:35.47]It just, it fell over!
[346:37.67]What am I supposed to do?
[346:39.05]I don't, I don't know.
[346:40.03]I can't, I can't do it.
[346:41.55]No, you get out there.
[346:42.21]I'm going to pick that train up with my bare hands.
[346:44.03]I'm going to lift it up over my back.
[346:45.58]I'm going to carry that train back onto the train tracks.
[346:48.96]I'm going to put that train back on the tracks.
[346:51.32]And I'm going to, I'm going to push it from behind and push it to its destination.
[347:02.07]That's awesome.
[347:04.60]Somebody just called me a drama queen.
[347:08.70]I lost track of where that was going.
[347:11.99]Oh, oh, so you guys, you guys, you know, you stay mad, right?
[347:14.55]Like, oh man, it takes me, I get so angry and I get on full tilt, but I just push the train and I'm suddenly on like, I'm on a train track.
[347:23.43]No, I, you do, I said when I derail, it's really easy for me to derail and how to get the train back on.
[347:31.30]You have to just like, I think you, I think you derailed that explanation.
[347:46.97]Oh, alright, dude.
[347:49.55]Thanks for doing bingo.
[347:51.23]It was good time.
[347:52.71]It was a crazy time.
[347:54.82]Feel like it was a wild and I think this one was way way more intense than the first one.
[348:01.62]Oh yeah, in the first one was crazy too.
[348:04.60]Except for the part where I was, uh, I was, uh.
[348:07.87]Eating stew while watching a body video at 8 times speed, except that.
[348:14.23]I mean, that sounds pretty pretty funny to me.
[348:16.09]I mean, that was I'm saying that was chill.
[348:17.97]That was the chill part, OK?
[348:22.12]But yeah, thanks so much.
[348:22.76]It was fun and hopefully we could play EDF soon when we get scheduling figured out.
[348:27.48]Yeah, pretty much today.
[348:29.20]Today is Wednesday.
[348:36.86]You want to try to get something?
[348:38.64]Vinny was saying Monday, but I don't want to confirm any times on stream right now because it's probably going to change at this point.
[348:45.59]Let's just like call it like that week.
[348:47.85]Like at some point, like from the 5th, like forward, like at some point, just keep an eye on it.
[348:52.15]We're going to play some EDF.
[348:54.36]EDF 6.
[348:58.05]uh yeah dude always pleasure thanks for uh hey and by the way guys like we we kind of came up with all those spaces you know me Ster Holly Ashley we kind of like put our brains together and we're just like what could we do that's funny or fun so very much huge huge thanks to uh everybody that you are not seeing right now like the my mods are over here actually isn't um there's a few other people over here too isn't there we we had some some support over here
[349:28.61]Who else is in this, uh, this group?
[349:33.43]Oh, Ronnie was over here.
[349:34.65]Ronnie was over helping like keep track of stuff.
[349:39.40]So that's awesome.
[349:40.26]Thanks.
[349:40.70]Uh, everybody obviously like, uh, all the people from my end that have been helping.
[349:48.96]Yep.
[349:49.24]Thanks everybody.
[349:49.88]I'm going to hop out so you can say goodbye.
[349:51.54]Goodbye.
[349:52.46]See you later.
[349:56.59]I think we had VRJosh.
[350:00.13]Dr. Clay was over here.
[350:01.19]Ronnie.
[350:04.63]I think... Wait, was Camping Campfire over here?
[350:11.05]I think he was.
[350:14.44]He was here the first day.
[350:16.18]And I think a little bit of this one, too.
[350:18.90]Oh, yeah, Leather Jacket was here, too.
[350:21.92]Appreciate it, guys.
[350:22.56]Seriously.
[350:23.52]It's kind of like an endeavor.
[350:24.84]He just said I didn't do shit.
[350:29.19]Well, you were moral support.
[350:34.01]But I appreciate it.
[350:34.65]Thanks, everybody.
[350:37.09]And I'll be live at some point when we do EDF.
[350:41.10]Not going to give time like Ster was saying, but I need to eat something.
[350:47.34]I'm hungry.
[350:48.16]I want to do this.
[350:49.08]I don't want to do that.
[350:50.90]You can tell how when it's so fucking funny, you can always tell when I am with and this is the doubters.
[350:57.60]I'm going to give you a little bit of advice.
[350:58.80]If we ever do something like this again, if you need to bet against me, I agree with you bet against me every time, every single time.
[351:06.85]I'm going to lose almost every time.
[351:09.09]When I start to complain about an encounter, when I start to talk shit about the game, when I'm like, I don't know, the game is kind of like, it's stupid, isn't it?
[351:19.92]Don't you think this part of the game is really stupid?
[351:23.10]I'm like within 20 minutes of beating it.
[351:31.61]When that train goes off the rails, you should be betting, you should be believing at that point.
[351:37.35]Now it might take two or three hundred failures to get there.
[351:48.44]Lil Aggie is streaming right now if anyone's curious about it.
[351:50.77]Yeah, and this whole thing was... It was inspiration from that Elden Ring bingo, like I said last time.
[352:00.51]We had StarZeroChris.
[352:02.43]I reached out.
[352:03.37]We talked about it a little bit.
[352:04.37]I was like, how do you guys even do this?
[352:06.41]It's a really cool community.
[352:07.99]Bingo Brawlers.
[352:12.00]Yeah, Lil Aggie.
[352:12.70]I think Captain Domo is the three that do a lot of the setup.
[352:17.18]I think there's plenty others as well in that community.
[352:19.73]They're all awesome.
[352:21.29]Go check it out.
[352:22.27]Bingo Brawlers.
[352:23.85]They do this all the time.
[352:27.10]Check it out if you thought that was cool.
[352:29.32]Yeah, Captain Domo is the originator.
[352:30.59]Yeah.
[352:32.11]Well, thanks for coming up with something cool.
[352:35.99]Because it was fun to do.
[352:45.76]Alright.
[352:46.72]I am going to go.
[352:47.42]I'll see you guys when I see you.
[352:49.12]I'll update the Sasa at some point next week.
[352:52.60]I'm glad it ended that way.
[352:53.64]I would have been sad if I couldn't do it.
[352:56.72]But I did it.
[352:58.56]I just swallowed the hatred and just went for it.
[353:06.95]Yeah, thanks again, Ster.
[353:09.23]Always fun to hang out with Ster.
[353:11.29]Ster's a really funny, really, really sweet dude.
[353:14.84]So, it's always a pleasure.
[353:25.15]Alright, everybody.
[353:25.71]Take care of yourselves.
[353:28.03]See you soon.
[353:29.69]Good night.
[353:30.21]Goodbye.
[353:30.67]Call your mother.
[353:31.29]You know what to do.
[353:45.68]On a scale of 1 to 10, how high was my anger?
[353:49.48]How far did we go?
[353:51.72]Honestly, it felt like a 6 or a 7 for me.
[353:56.94]Yeah, we were approaching an 8, but no.
[354:01.13]I feel like it was about a 7.
[354:02.59]About a 6 or 7.
[354:05.83]It was a 7.
[354:07.79]Yeah, 7.5.
[354:08.39]You were going to ban all of us.
[354:11.66]No, I wasn't.
[354:19.60]How did you convince Vinny to play EDF or anybody else?
[354:24.69]Okay, let me just be very clear here.
[354:28.00]A month ago, we had like a little group chat and we were like, hey, maybe we should play EDF.
[354:33.72]That was like a month and a half ago.
[354:36.68]So we need to make sure everyone still wants to do it.
[354:43.28]Because we didn't realize it didn't come out until like a week ago.
[354:46.28]We thought it came out a month ago.
[354:58.41]What about Etalyx?
[355:00.39]Actually, I gotta reach out to Etalyx.
[355:03.26]I've been in that mode where I kind of shut, like, down.
[355:06.78]You know, sometimes you just go into those modes where you're like, I don't really... I don't really talk into too many people.
[355:13.91]Just kind of doing my own thing and chilling.
[355:17.03]But, yeah, there's people I would like to kind of reach out to and do some more stuff with.
[355:29.67]Return of the soundboard.
[355:30.79]You're going to do another Elden Ring bingo?
[355:36.59]We have another board.
[355:37.47]I would say I wouldn't expect it at this point.
[355:43.15]But we do have a third board.
[355:47.09]What about Poke?
[355:47.75]Poke was part of the people we were... Yeah, Poke was down a while ago.
[355:57.34]Yeah, I want to start by kind of reaching out to people and just... It's interesting because... I kind of always like did my own thing for a long, long time.
[356:08.00]You know, for almost 10 straight years, I didn't, you know, only like a couple people I ever really collabed with or talked to or whatever.
[356:17.46]But over the last few years, I really dialed up like the amount of people I was talking to and networking and reaching out to this person and this person and doing this and doing that and talking to you and talking to you.
[356:27.54]And I know that I've, you know, obviously said that I'm kind of done in the streaming department in regards to doing it all the time or having it be like a career choice, which, you know, call that what you will, right?
[356:39.93]Effectively, it's just I don't have a schedule and I'm only streaming like maybe once or twice a month.
[356:45.11]But I've also started kind of slowing down talking to people too.
[356:53.94]So, I'm, uh... I think I'm getting pretty good balance.
[357:01.04]I'm having a good time.
[357:02.11]Things are going good.
[357:05.29]You're turning into a recluse?
[357:06.61]No, no, nothing like that.
[357:08.95]But I can definitely feel myself just sort of slowing down even in my own personal life, too.
[357:19.70]Slowing down for hibernation, yeah.
[357:22.77]But yeah, things are going well.
[357:25.87]I am going to go.
[357:26.91]See you guys later.
[357:28.57]Thanks for watching.
[357:29.65]That was a crazy finish.
[357:31.64]And now I don't have to go run from one end of my room with my head down to the other end of my room doing a juggernaut kind of bowl move and putting my head through the drywall.
[357:44.38]So I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore.
[357:46.30]I was considering it.
[357:49.38]Okay.
[357:49.96]Good to know.
[357:52.46]Take care.
[357:53.10]See you guys later.
[358:51.06]So,
[359:25.89]you
