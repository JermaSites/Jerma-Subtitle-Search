[00:00.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[00:01.95]Alright everybody, here it is.
[00:03.05]This is the Go!
[00:03.91]Go!
[00:04.21]Nippon squiggly line.
[00:05.62]My first trip to Japan squiggly line.
[00:07.84]Can you make an entertaining video about this game?
[00:11.50]Challenge.
[00:13.20]Jerma, do you think it can be done?
[00:15.16]I don't think it can be done.
[00:16.38]I don't think it can be done.
[00:17.77]Two sisters show you around Japan with the same two poses.
[00:20.81]You don't think there's a video here?
[00:22.21]If you successfully complete the Nippon Go!
[00:24.61]Go!
[00:25.03]Japan Tour Challenge video,
[00:28.27]I don't even know.
[00:28.91]I don't even know what I can say.
[00:29.99]If I watch this video and I'm like, holy shit, that was fucking humble.
[00:33.81]That was a great video.
[00:36.65]You win the challenge.
[00:37.48]Like, I don't know what I'm going to give you.
[00:38.76]You win the challenge.
[00:40.62]Like, I'll go on record as the Go Go Nippon challenge winner.
[00:44.62]Yeah.
[00:45.74]You'll get a medal.
[00:47.63]Not even photographs of Japan.
[00:49.33]This isn't, like, this isn't any real value.
[00:51.93]Like, I'm actually curious.
[00:53.53]I'm going to Japan soon.
[00:54.69]No, these are drawings of, like, there's a picture of food in the... It's not real food.
[01:04.06]These noodles are, like, doused with pubic hairs.
[01:06.82]I don't know.
[01:07.24]I'm going to Japan.
[01:08.36]I'll see you later.
[01:09.84]We will now be entering Japanese airspace.
[01:15.00]Please buckle your seatbelts.
[01:17.10]Welcome to Nippon, yeah!
[01:18.88]Japan, Nippon, yeah!
[01:20.10]That was a pretty quick plane ride.
[01:23.11]Wow!
[01:24.63]My beloved Japan!
[01:26.57]I swear to make the most of my time here, I'm already moist.
[01:29.63]I'll be staying with two brothers I met in the chatroom, Makoto and Akira.
[01:33.13]But they're actually both girls!
[01:36.62]What?!
[01:37.88]I could've sworn they were boys.
[01:39.14]Oh, wait a minute.
[01:41.92]What if you are both boys?
[01:47.04]Excuse me, sorry to bother you, but are you Barack Obama?
[01:53.54]She knows.
[01:54.26]Her parents aren't here.
[01:57.62]Her parents aren't here?
[01:58.94]Oh, so... Um, what did you just say?
[02:03.46]They will be gone for two weeks.
[02:05.76]I can't handle this.
[02:07.47]Uh, sure.
[02:09.65]You go do that.
[02:10.63]I'm gonna...
[02:11.95]The parents aren't here.
[02:13.35]They won't be back until after I'm gone.
[02:14.99]The whole time I'm in Japan, the only ones in the house will be Makoto, Akira, and I?
[02:21.58]This is escalating too quickly.
[02:22.90]It's not like I've done anything to feel guilty about, but I'm gonna touch those titties.
[02:27.64]I'm not gonna think about that stuff anymore.
[02:29.22]I have to repress my anime teenage angst.
[02:32.87]I have to.
[02:33.77]If I don't, just imagine the person I could turn into.
[02:36.43]Gurugamesh!
[02:38.65]I love anime!
[02:41.56]And manga!
[02:44.24]And gaming!
[02:47.96]Day one.
[02:49.20]Wait, then what was yesterday?
[02:50.86]Here we go.
[02:51.38]I'm pressing the toilet button.
[02:53.68]Oprah!
[02:55.50]Switch on.
[02:57.28]Didn't do anything.
[02:58.46]What was that?
[02:59.00]What is this?
[03:00.26]It's like a warm breeze blowing up from deep inside.
[03:03.40]Why does this toilet blow wind at me?
[03:05.36]I'm going to press another switch.
[03:07.76]Take this!
[03:08.18]What?
[03:11.38]Now there's a nozzle rising up in... A SQUEEZE BLOWING WATER UP MY ASSHOLE!
[03:18.28]NO!
[03:19.44]SOMEONE MAKE IT STOP!
[03:24.10]Jerma, this is all actually happening.
[03:26.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:28.42]Wait, what?
[03:29.28]Wait, hold on.
[03:29.92]Wait, this whole time that you haven't been... Wait a second, wait a second.
[03:34.55]We're in a maid cafe!
[03:35.85]Yay!
[03:36.99]Oo-goo.
[03:38.93]Hi.
[03:40.01]Here's your menu.
[03:41.19]Please tell me when you've made a choice.
[03:43.77]Oh yeah, what a frickin' pun!
[03:45.31]Sock it to him!
[03:46.25]Yeah, you do it!
[03:47.13]Obama bringin' the house down!
[03:48.61]I was actually just thinking about how these really creepy maid cafes are actually really classy because they give you a glass of water before you even order.
[03:55.36]I've never had water in America.
[03:57.16]Yeah, water, tea, and a hand wipe after the maids are done with you are the basics of Japanese hospitality.
[04:02.96]Oh yeah, you know, I could see that.
[04:04.22]You know, Japan is really attentive to your needs.
[04:09.53]What absolutely ridiculous Japanese propaganda game am I playing right now?
[04:13.86]Where the whole game, not just this, they're talking about how America sucks, Japan's so much better, there's this whole scene about how their train system just destroys us and they're technologically advanced.
[04:22.15]Well you know what, screw you.
[04:23.29]At least America doesn't make propaganda video games.
[04:26.45]Whatever.
[04:27.23]Screw you.
[04:28.45]Obese out.
[04:29.35]I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of the United States of America in close combat.
[04:38.91]Day two!
[04:40.33]Oh, it's morning.
[04:41.41]I wonder where they're gonna take me today.
[04:43.13]I bet it's gonna be fun.
[04:44.81]But first, I better just, you know, wash my face, wake up, you know, go to the bathroom.
[04:51.89]Huh?
[04:52.79]Is that what I think?
[04:53.97]Oh my god, wow, that is a laundry machine in the bathroom.
[04:57.29]I actually never thought about even doing that, but that makes complete sense.
[05:01.37]You don't need, like, a hamper to put your clothes in, because the laundry machine is, like, right there.
[05:06.94]Japan is so advanced.
[05:10.27]Day 3.
[05:10.55]This video's gonna suck.
[05:17.48]I've been playing for like an hour now!
[05:18.88]Well like, all the places you go they're like explaining a lot of things and like how the train system works and like all this boring shit in between.
[05:29.43]But like behind all that, will I ever be able to confess that I'm like a huge pervert?
[05:39.48]Yeah, I know.
[05:40.28]I'm skipping a lot of it too, but maybe you could just hear how depressed I am.
[05:45.02]I'm gonna be honest, I just don't know what happened before.
[05:52.07]I already see where this is going.
[05:54.73]How could this not be where this is going?
[05:57.31]I'm gonna entertain the idea and go wake her up, sure.
[06:00.52]But I gotta tell you, I didn't come all the way from Sweden to, you know...
[06:04.71]She's in this room, and oh, guess what?
[06:07.05]I just wanted to learn about Japan.
[06:08.53]I'm gonna be real right now.
[06:09.63]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[06:10.75]I just wanted to learn about Japan.
[06:11.89]You guys are twisted.
[06:16.81]I don't know what to do.
[06:17.35]They just keep coming at me.
[06:18.46]I don't know what to do.
[06:19.60]They just keep... Wait, what?
[06:21.20]I have no eyes?
[06:22.04]You see, this is actually day five now.
[06:24.10]I don't know what happened to day four.
[06:26.14]Yes, unlike Akira, I've always been bad about saying what I really feel.
[06:31.39]Ever since I was a child, I've been unstable.
[06:33.29]I put my feelings into honest words.
[06:36.03]Are you there, Jerma?
[06:39.15]Um, hello?
[06:41.17]What's going on?
[06:42.77]I thought you were Jerma.
[06:44.51]You don't understand.
[06:46.05]Was he, like, here and left?
[06:47.76]Or did you think I was going to be him?
[06:51.00]I thought you were him.
[06:52.66]No!
[06:53.24]Alright, well, um, I can relate to this game a little bit better now.
[06:57.70]Pretty awkward.
[06:59.52]Final destination.
[07:04.53]Makoto!
[07:08.01]I love you.
[07:09.77]I'm in love with you.
[07:12.09]Processing emotion.
[07:14.69]I thought you were a robot for a little while, to be honest, but I feel the same way.
[07:23.24]Kiss.
[07:26.96]I'm so glad I came to Japan to see you.
[07:28.76]This has been amazing for me.
[07:31.52]Kiss me again.
[07:35.87]Exterminate!
