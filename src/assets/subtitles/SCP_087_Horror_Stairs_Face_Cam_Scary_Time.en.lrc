[00:08.53]Hey, what is going on, guys?
[00:10.31]Jerma here with SCP-087.
[00:14.02]Now, if you don't know what this game is, this is a freeware game.
[00:18.40]The link will be in the description.
[00:20.48]It's a horror game, and apparently it's one of the scariest damn games ever made.
[00:26.31]Now, I don't do well with these types of games, and as you can see, I'm down the first flight of stairs and I already don't want to play.
[00:33.32]But I have to.
[00:34.50]And I figured it would be fun to have the face cam there in case something crazy happens, which I know it will.
[00:40.17]So, let's get started.
[00:42.29]And to try not to psych myself out while I do this, I'm going to give you the backstory of the game.
[00:50.29]So, pretty much, this game... I already don't want to do this.
[00:58.55]So pretty much this game was made in two days by a guy, some programming designer or something.
[01:04.95]He said he did it on coffee breaks.
[01:07.15]And it's a stairway... Somebody's coming behind me right now.
[01:15.79]I don't want to look up there.
[01:18.11]It's a stairway simulator game where this is really all you do.
[01:23.65]God.
[01:24.37]God damn it.
[01:26.49]Get me out of here.
[01:30.95]Like, I can't stop moving now.
[01:32.17]I don't know how long I do it.
[01:37.66]This could last, like, less than three minutes.
[01:39.48]Like, this could end.
[01:40.38]I might just rage to quit.
[01:57.51]God.
[01:58.91]Damn it.
[01:59.49]I hate this.
[02:02.13]But you go down a series of stairs over and over again.
[02:06.69]And that's the game.
[02:11.07]And the goal is to see how far you can go down, how many stairs you can go down.
[02:15.75]I'm at floor number six, and I'm almost ready to just quit this game.
[02:22.51]And it messes with you, too.
[02:24.23]I keep on repeating myself, probably, but that's because I am terrified right now.
[02:29.27]I can't even play, like, Resident Evil without having somebody else in the room with me.
[02:33.13]Let alone a game like this.
[02:43.90]Floor eight.
[02:47.48]I really, I, you know what, I need, like, ten people in the room with me to all be, like, hanging out.
[02:52.09]Because this is just, this is me by myself with headphones on.
[02:54.75]The hell was that?
[02:59.76]Law number nine.
[03:00.62]Wait, wasn't I already on?
[03:01.73]The stuff is getting louder, too.
[03:07.21]That's the worst part about this.
[03:08.59]The stuff is getting just loud and horrible.
[03:20.33]See, it's so much repetition that you're doing the same thing over and over again, and you know at some point...
[03:31.00]Something horrible is going to happen.
[03:34.46]You just don't know when.
[03:40.57]So I'm going to... If you hit escape, you end the game.
[03:44.55]Hitting escape ends it.
[03:46.57]And that's going to happen.
[03:47.53]Definitely. 19...
[04:00.13]It's actually, it's really... OH!
[04:15.95]You knew it was gonna happen at some point, you just didn't know when.
[04:18.22]I'm at floor 20.
[04:18.68]I wanna, I'm done.
[04:26.91]Can't give up that easily.
[04:28.62]This stuff is going to get much... I don't even want to go down.
[04:38.42]God... God... You bastard.
[04:44.38]You son of a bitch.
[04:54.16]I don't think I'll be able to...
[04:56.33]I don't think I'll be able to go past 30.
[04:58.46]Somebody's right there.
[04:59.22]That was something.
[05:00.00]What is that?
[05:00.78]No, it's the shadow.
[05:01.66]It's the shadow of the... I think that's the first time I saw that.
[05:09.58]That is the first time. 27.
[05:22.57]See, the shadows are really starting to mess with you now.
[05:25.33]The shadows are really starting to kick in and really start to freak you out.
[05:29.91]Because I didn't notice them before.
[05:31.23]I can't even look at the screen.
[05:44.16]I can't.
[05:45.34]I seriously can't look at the screen.
[05:49.06]My whole body hurts right now from what just happened.
[05:57.13]What is that?
[05:57.87]That's a face!
[05:59.09]OH MY GOD!
[06:10.38]Okay.
[06:16.88]See you next time.
