[00:07.61]Doing good?
[00:08.65]Me too.
[00:09.63]I'm doing good too.
[00:13.71]Hey, still in school?
[00:15.75]Good.
[00:17.03]Still at that job?
[00:18.67]Good.
[00:20.91]Still hanging out with, uh... Good.
[00:23.79]Cool.
[00:32.29]Still eating salmon?
[00:34.09]Good.
[00:35.08]Good.
[00:43.28]No, no.
[00:45.92]3 AM stream.
[00:46.82]There's a light one.
[00:48.19]But there's a reason for that.
[00:50.21]Told you guys I was gonna go four days in a row.
[00:55.19]Because...
[00:56.98]I got a lot of stuff planned.
[00:58.18]I'm taking a vacation.
[01:00.89]And I'm not talking about, oh, I'll be gone for three days.
[01:03.53]I'm taking a real... I ain't gonna be around for like a week.
[01:10.73]I'm gonna be... I'm disconnecting from the internet for a little while.
[01:14.88]My mother is coming up.
[01:17.42]And I'm gonna spend time with my mom.
[01:25.35]It's been a long time since I've seen her.
[01:27.87]We have a lot of activities planned.
[01:29.35]We're going to do some mother-son things.
[01:33.07]And there's also some other family that are coming up as well.
[01:37.36]So I'm going to be tied up for a while.
[01:42.46]I will return.
[01:44.88]You'll see me again.
[01:47.60]Probably on... We'll probably go, depending on what we do today.
[01:52.09]This stream was just kind of a hangout sesh.
[01:55.31]You know?
[01:57.75]Yesterday we played Gunslinger.
[02:00.71]It was great.
[02:01.73]Had a lot of fun.
[02:03.29]Today there's not a whole lot of plans.
[02:06.43]I just knew that I was not going to be live for at least five days.
[02:11.16]So I kind of wanted just to hang out a little bit longer.
[02:15.94]So what we've decided to do is we're going to play Sam & Max.
[02:20.48]It's been one of the most requested
[02:26.23]Games for me to stream on this channel.
[02:31.31]There's been one guy in particular.
[02:33.30]I'm more like two one guys.
[02:36.38]I've been really, really looking forward to it.
[02:40.44]This Doki Doki, but I already told you I wasn't going to play Doki Doki.
[02:49.01]But no, we're just going to hang out.
[02:51.39]Play a little Sam & Max, relax.
[02:53.85]After we do this, we might do an episode.
[02:56.19]Depending on if people want to keep seeing it.
[02:58.51]Maybe we'll do another episode.
[03:01.23]I want to watch a couple videos.
[03:03.62]I want to... There's a few things I want to... There's another game on Steam that I was looking at.
[03:08.74]It looked cool.
[03:11.80]This is just a... There are no cares in the world on this stream today.
[03:17.46]I don't have a plan.
[03:18.30]We're just going.
[03:25.10]But let me make a tweet about it.
[03:27.90]Because I am live, so.
[03:29.75]See you guys in a minute.
[05:24.91]Hey!
[05:27.17]So why don't we switch over to it?
[05:31.09]It's currently bright here.
[05:32.90]Hopefully it captures bright.
[05:37.02]And did it?
[05:38.48]Oh god, I don't think it did.
[05:39.78]Yeah, it did.
[05:42.58]So I don't know very much about this game besides that it's a point-and-click game and we're in a point-and-click mood.
[05:50.63]This is not Doki Doki Literature Club.
[05:54.35]This is Sam and Max on the road again.
[06:01.71]A classic.
[06:02.43]I've never played.
[06:04.25]You ready?
[06:09.35]Actually playing... New game.
[06:13.79]This might be a little loud.
[06:14.83]We can adjust the volume.
[06:16.17]But just be prepared.
[06:16.97]You might get a little bit of like a blast.
[06:19.87]An audio blast.
[06:26.60]What?
[06:27.47]Already 10 out of 10.
[06:30.11]Anytime a saxophone presents itself in a video game, it's already a fucking 8 or a 9 at least.
[06:55.62]Uh-oh.
[07:16.96]Hey, Jesus.
[07:19.00]When are we going to get another case, Sam?
[07:20.74]Surely the local lawbreakers must miss our esoteric brand of personalized criminal justice.
[07:25.10]Patience is a sharp razor to swallow, little buddy.
[07:28.34]Okay, don't scream this time.
[07:31.68]I got it.
[07:32.20]I got it.
[07:32.78]Hello?
[07:35.42]What?
[07:36.18]Leave Swiss cheese by the rat hole or you'll never see your precious phone alive again.
[07:41.30]Jiminy Christmas Eve in a padlocked sweat box.
[07:43.93]Some misguidedly ballsy felons napped our phone.
[07:46.93]Eerie.
[07:47.53]I just went cheese shopping.
[07:49.03]How did they know?
[07:50.21]Be sure it's Swiss cheese, right?
[07:52.73]And be quick about it.
[07:54.90]We got some rats already.
[07:56.46]Okay.
[07:57.00]So this is the two characters.
[07:58.38]This is Sam and this is Max.
[07:59.38]I only know that because not only is it telling me this, I remember the thing from Team Fortress.
[08:03.44]Max's head.
[08:04.50]They're worth a lot of money.
[08:25.73]So we gotta get cheese.
[08:27.65]This is a point-and-click adventure game.
[08:28.73]You get your cardboard box inventory.
[08:30.05]Let's turn it down a little.
[08:33.02]I already tried.
[08:34.36]How's that?
[08:34.86]That's probably alright.
[08:35.66]Voice there?
[08:36.06]That's fine.
[08:36.48]Wait, he's talking about me.
[08:55.61]Louder Louder louder put it on low graphics.

[09:31.13]Hey, Max.
[09:32.25]When is it, Sam?
[09:34.47]Where's the cheese?
[09:35.09]You sure you don't remember where you put that cheese, little buddy?
[09:37.95]Sheesh, you'd think I'd forgotten my pants or something.
[09:40.69]It's here in the office someplace.
[09:42.16]Pants?
[09:42.56]He's looking for his pants.
[09:44.64]Let's get to work.
[09:45.72]I couldn't agree more.
[09:47.10]Okay, looking for his pants.

[09:50.52]This might come in handy.
[09:52.87]Don't do that again.
[09:53.65]Alright, we got a boxing glove.
[09:55.39]Can I see it?
[09:57.23]I got a gun and a boxing glove.

[10:51.74]Uh, what about the desk?
[10:53.42]VCR, television... Lava lamp.
[10:54.82]This thing looks like a regular Nintendo.
[11:15.96]I bought that VCR at the supermarket.
[11:18.20]So you know it's a good one.
[11:19.70]Still smells like asparagus, though.
[11:21.66]Oh.
[11:24.02]Open, uh, lush vegetation.
[11:25.88]I think Hubert could use some water, Max.
[11:28.52]I'm training him to fetch it himself.
[11:32.74]Out the window.
[11:35.30]Cheese?
[11:36.50]It looks like cheese right there.
[11:37.48]The cheese ball is like cheese curds, right?
[11:41.57]Look at curds, cheese curds.
[11:45.10]They say graffiti is the poetry of our time.
[11:47.40]Just what we need.
[11:48.46]More lame poetry.
[11:59.53]Cheese.
[12:02.79]Look at the cheese.
[12:05.55]In the closet?
[12:08.35]There's a lot of cheese.
[12:11.39]That's too much cheese.
[12:12.39]I thought that was gonna be like a piece of cheese.
[12:15.36]Why?
[12:16.00]Oh, okay.
[12:16.30]Well, that was... That's not it.
[12:17.80]That's a gag.
[12:19.16]Okay.
[12:19.70]Swiss cheese.
[12:44.24]I want Swiss cheese.
[12:45.76]Well, can we go to the supermarket?
[12:47.04]2002 was a great year for calendars.
[12:51.76]This is old.
[12:52.20]I'm glad we stocked up.
[12:53.30]We've been going through them at a rate of about one a year since then.
[13:00.98]Pizza?
[13:01.74]There's no Swiss cheese on pizza, right?
[13:04.07]What do I have for items?
[13:06.91]Bowling ball, boxing glove, big gun.
[13:10.21]Okay, he takes it out.
[13:12.45]Wait, I can aim the gun?
[13:14.69]Tempting sometimes, but I've become fond of the little guy.
[13:20.89]Whoa.
[13:22.64]How many bullets are in here?
[13:23.48]Alright, he has infinite ammo.
[13:33.97]What about the boxing glove?
[13:37.69]I'd rather punch other things.
[13:44.77]Just cover the hole.
[13:47.05]Apart from the holes, I don't think it looks much like Swiss cheese.
[14:06.82]Take that, you law-breaking dairy product.
[14:09.04]Got it.
[14:09.36]Sam, no!
[14:10.10]The cheese was innocent!
[14:11.20]I got it.
[14:11.68]Yeah, it's a cartoon.
[14:12.96]I think not.
[14:14.76]Yep.
[14:15.92]You gotta think like a cartoon.
[14:16.78]He read chat.
[14:17.54]He read chat.
[14:18.06]I didn't fucking do that.
[14:18.69]What the fuck he's doing?
[14:19.79]I didn't fucking do that.
[14:42.15]Greetings.
[14:43.15]The members of the Benevolent Brotherhood of Vermin would like to thank you for your offering.
[14:48.09]The members of Sam and Max would like their phone back now.
[14:51.37]If you don't mind.
[14:53.01]I regret to inform you the situation has changed, and I am unable to comply with your request.
[14:59.49]A list of additional demands for the return of the phone is as follows.
[15:07.96]Now, let's discuss this calmly.
[15:10.20]Let's debone the smarmy little skis and see if the phone's in there.
[15:13.83]I ain't talking, coppers.
[15:15.39]Jimmy Tootie ain't no rat.
[15:17.35]Uh, well, I ain't talking.
[15:20.85]So wait, I can decide?
[15:22.91]How about I'll feed you broken glass?
[15:25.10]I'm thinking about stuffing a light bulb down your throat, perp.
[15:27.98]Go ahead.
[15:28.78]I've been a little hungry.
[15:30.04]Hey, dogface, your partner's giving me a headache.
[15:36.80]No, we're gonna do good cop, bad cop.
[15:40.45]Good cop, bad cop.
[15:43.95]You can't just go full bad cop.
[15:45.77]I'm gonna strangle you.
[15:47.55]I'm gonna feed you glass.
[15:49.55]No, we have to, like, bring you a cake or something, right?
[15:54.04]You mentioned a headache.
[15:54.96]Would you like some aspirin?
[15:56.28]Oh, and while I'm at it, is there anything else I can do to make you comfortable?
[15:59.60]Are you thirsty, perhaps?
[16:01.02]Light's too bright?
[16:02.01]Well, that's sportin' of you.
[16:03.75]Now you mention it, I really don't like being up here so high.
[16:07.01]I got me a thing about heights.
[16:08.39]They make me nervous, you know?
[16:10.21]Oh, really?
[16:12.31]I could adjust the lights.
[16:13.75]Would you like some... a smoothie?
[16:15.73]I can make that for you, too.
[16:16.93]I like that, but I almost dropped my whole coffee.
[16:21.91]Uh, how about, okay, let's, let's let him out.
[16:24.53]Alright, let's help me help you.
[16:25.75]Now tell me.
[16:26.41]Okay, uh, he wants to get, how do we put him down?
[16:51.76]We'll go half easy on you if you'll just cough up the phone.
[16:55.06]Yeah, yeah.
[16:56.18]Never happened, pig.
[17:01.92]We've met your demands.
[17:02.88]We got you the cheese.
[17:04.24]Any honorable rodent would hold up his end of the bargain and give back our phone.
[17:08.14]Us rodents is not known for being particularly honorable.
[17:10.52]I was going to put him down.
[17:11.62]I want to put him down on the ground.
[17:14.60]Don't like heights, eh?
[17:15.96]How'd you like it if I dangled your greasy hide out the window?
[17:18.94]Hey, you wouldn't.
[17:21.76]I warn you, I'm known for my fuzzy white butterfingers.
[17:25.11]It's true.
[17:26.03]You should see him trying to tie an ascot.
[17:28.07]Alright, alright.
[17:29.07]Have mercy.
[17:30.23]I've had mercy.
[17:31.25]It was unpleasantly gooey.
[17:32.49]Like, well, like things that have fallen onto pavement from a great height.
[17:35.63]I give up.
[17:36.63]Take your phone and let me go.
[17:40.64]He has the phone up.
[17:42.58]I wish I could unsee that.
[17:43.98]Hello?
[17:47.32]Yes?
[17:49.04]You throw him out the window?
[17:51.06]He killed that guy.
[17:51.86]He dropped that guy out the window and murdered him.
[17:59.18]Okay, well that... Get down to the corner store.
[18:18.41]Okay.
[18:41.25]Yeah, this is cool so far.
[18:43.89]When I got this thing, I thought it would be useful.
[18:46.31]Where else would we keep the pieces of paper that we're never going to look at again?
[18:50.46]Alright, let's make sure I saved it.
[18:52.42]We'll pick it up another day.
[18:54.88]Maybe like I'm thinking about a few weeks or something.
[19:06.06]I'll see you guys later.
[19:06.79]That's it.
[19:07.17]20 minutes.
[19:11.14]Imagine if I streamed for like 15 minutes a day.
[19:15.10]20 minutes a day.
[19:24.04]20 minutes a week?
[19:25.34]You would never get anything done.
[19:28.92]It would be unbearable.
[19:29.98]You wouldn't be able to do anything.
[19:32.22]If you streamed for like fucking 20 minutes a week?
[19:40.81]Alright money wait, but there was something over here Remember I looked at the window and there's something on the ground I told you oh it's trash I don't think I can do anything about that We gotta go to the corner store I don't I really don't mean to keep hitting you like that.
[20:05.85]But what's that?
[20:06.29]Remember our old car max?
[20:08.35]I said I was sorry
[20:11.11]Oh, you ran into it.
[20:12.11]Well, look where you're going, dumpster.
[20:14.15]I once ate in that dumpster.
[20:15.07]Fresh food in there.
[20:16.11]Aging gorilla.
[20:17.19]I still don't know how she got out of the office.
[20:19.29]I was sure it locked the door.
[20:26.07]That was like what the YouTube used to be like.
[20:27.91]Yeah, but the thing about the YouTube videos was, okay, so, like, for instance, if I played Sekiro, like, three or four streams, and I condensed it down to, like, one or two videos, that's, like, how it worked.
[20:41.85]What is this guy doing?
[20:43.17]Say there, unfashionably dressed street urchin.
[20:46.36]Oh, you made me mess up.
[20:48.46]Now I have to start all over.
[20:49.92]Yeah, I had to edit it.
[20:51.14]You are one ugly kid.
[20:52.88]Hey, I know you.
[20:54.18]Oh, that's right.
[20:55.70]You're one of the lovable scamps from that old TV show about the singing soda jerks.
[21:00.30]It's called the Soda Poppers.
[21:03.10]And the 70s are not old.
[21:05.22]Specs, it's you.
[21:06.52]Wow, an actual celebrity vandalizing our neighborhood.
[21:09.94]This is great.
[21:12.31]Remember when you were famous?
[21:13.65]Remember when you were famous?
[21:16.01]You're under arrest!
[21:20.52]Look, I don't care who you are.
[21:22.48]I don't care what you're doing, where you've been.
[21:25.74]You are committing a crime.
[21:27.40]You're under arrest.
[21:28.18]What?
[21:28.62]That's not how it works.
[21:40.60]You're under arrest because you're doing that.
[21:42.66]That's why you're under arrest.
[21:44.88]Seriously, you're under arrest.
[21:46.78]Come along quietly and no one gets hurt.
[21:49.08]Actually, I prefer that you don't come quietly.
[21:51.50]Must finish painting.
[21:54.02]Alright, well, I guess you're not under arrest.
[22:01.87]Boy, you sure were a famous, oddly underdeveloped teen celebrity at one time.
[22:06.03]I'm still famous.
[22:07.71]Are you?
[22:08.75]Um, like a million point one times more famous than you.
[22:11.85]More famous than me?
[22:13.23]Well, you're really more known in the 18 to 34 year old repeat criminal demographic.
[22:19.34]I like that.
[22:19.78]That was a pretty good joke.
[22:22.80]Say, how about an autograph for my pal?
[22:24.86]You can sign my butt.
[22:26.20]Make it out to Squinky.
[22:27.74]I don't sign butts anymore.
[22:29.85]People get ticklish and they move and it gets all messed up.
[22:33.77]I'll risk it.
[22:34.21]What the fuck?
[22:34.79]Sorry, I can't stop painting.
[22:36.97]This has to be perfect.
[22:40.81]1834 repeat criminal demographic is my demographic.
[22:45.66]What, you guys saying you're all repeat criminals?
[22:50.31]So Specs, what are you up to these days?
[22:52.59]Any new projects?
[22:53.93]Yes.
[22:54.61]I have a new light in my life and his name is Brady Cultures.
[22:58.59]He's the genius behind the Eyebo's ocular fitness program.
[23:02.90]You really should try one of his videos.
[23:06.18]Where can I get the video?
[23:07.02]Where can I find a copy of the video?
[23:08.98]They carry them over at Bosco's.
[23:10.93]You should get it.
[23:11.49]Okay.
[23:16.38]Ibo sounds like an electronic archery toy.
[23:19.10]Ibo is the truly visionary ocular fitness program.
[23:22.80]Try the video today.
[23:24.88]Sure thing, we'll try.
[23:25.68]I love that voice.
[23:28.27]I'm gonna get, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get that done.
[23:32.47]Sounds fascinating, but enough about that.
[23:35.13]You can never get enough of Brady Culture's Ibo.
[23:38.83]Do I need money?
[23:39.39]Alright, we'll see.
[23:43.18]Well, that's nice.
[23:46.57]Now you're under arrest.
[23:48.51]Wait, what is he doing?
[23:49.01]What is this?
[23:49.41]What is it?
[23:49.83]Yeah, but why are you painting it?
[23:51.09]That's a good idea, Max.
[24:14.58]Sounds fascinating.
[24:15.52]That's a really good idea.
[24:17.22]You can never get enough.
[24:19.32]Alright, see you later.
[24:20.36]Well, we'll leave you to it.
[24:21.61]But you have to agree to paint me next.
[24:23.85]Sorry, I only paint Brady Culture.
[24:26.91]Max, you've got the TV schedule memorized.
[24:29.17]Weren't the soda poppers going to be featured on one of those grim celebrity tell-alls today?
[24:33.89]Oh, yeah, on Channel 173, the child star expose network, which we only get when it's convenient.
[24:42.01]Radio culture.
[24:44.13]Bosco's inconvenience.
[24:45.79]What about the paper box?
[24:46.61]Let's see.
[24:46.91]It says they've bred a horse with eight legs.
[24:49.43]Does it run twice as fast?
[24:51.32]No, but it does eat twice as much.
[24:55.78]That's good.
[24:56.54]It says cloning rights activists are cloning themselves to create a bigger voting bloc.
[25:01.06]It works for locusts.
[25:01.76]That's pretty good.
[25:06.81]It looks like he's got Boston baked beans in there.
[25:08.87]Oh, watch it, baby.
[25:09.63]Watch it.
[25:09.95]They stay fresh.
[25:11.07]They don't.
[25:14.23]Guns, beer, meat, and candy.
[25:16.77]The four food groups.
[25:29.43]Have no fear, simple citizens.
[25:31.45]The freelance police are here to... So we're not actual police, is that what I'm getting?
[25:37.28]It's just you two?
[25:38.84]Where's the SWAT team?
[25:40.16]Where's the National Guard?
[25:41.58]Where's NASA?
[25:43.19]NASA?
[25:44.01]Hold on, Bosco.
[25:45.31]What's the problem?
[25:46.61]What's the problem?
[25:47.77]It's a terrorist.
[25:48.87]A munchkin terrorist.
[25:50.37]He'll be the death of us all.
[25:54.07]What munchkin terrorist?
[25:55.85]What audience?
[26:13.33]Remain calm.
[26:14.19]What's he doing?
[26:14.89]I think we got it.
[26:16.47]What's he doing?
[26:16.91]Remain calm.
[26:17.99]Video dumping.
[26:41.08]Any other complaints?
[26:41.88]Have you seen this Ivo video?
[26:44.10]What's on the video?
[26:44.74]Have you actually witnessed this Ivo video with your own eyes?
[26:49.02]Only a fool would watch a strange video.
[26:51.58]You watch it.
[26:56.31]Any other heinous terrorist activities to report?
[26:58.85]Yes, he keeps using my bathroom.
[27:01.35]Who knows what he's doing in there?
[27:03.45]I think I know.
[27:04.57]So, we've got an unloaded video dumper and serial leak taker.
[27:09.07]Not even the National Guard can help us now.
[27:13.27]Okay, so that's it.
[27:14.94]So all this wizard character's doing is delivering videos.
[27:19.06]And abusing his bathroom.
[27:20.62]That's it?
[27:21.52]Did he steal any of your overpriced merchandise or at least try to disembowel you with a sharpened spork?
[27:26.78]No way.
[27:27.68]I've got BTAD, the single most technologically advanced security system ever conceived by the human mind.
[27:35.36]Alright.
[27:35.66]What is, what is, hold on.
[27:37.00]What is BTADS?
[27:38.40]Why are these all weird?
[27:39.42]AIBO.
[27:40.06]BTAD.
[27:41.38]BTADS?
[27:42.34]Is that one of those acronym things I've been hearing so much about?
[27:45.22]Yep.
[27:45.69]Bosco Tech Automated Defense System.
[27:48.73]I made it myself.
[27:50.61]Wow.
[27:50.95]I always wanted to automate my defense.
[27:52.91]How does it work?
[27:54.09]Just pull a weapon.
[27:55.23]You'll see.
[27:56.39]Or try and walk out of here with something.
[27:58.48]Go ahead.
[27:58.98]I dare you.
[28:00.02]Maybe we will.
[28:00.60]Alright.
[28:06.08]I've had enough of you.
[28:07.12]I think we got it.
[28:08.36]Okay.
[28:09.02]Anything else?
[28:10.90]I've had enough.
[28:14.10]Out of you.
[28:14.72]We'll chat more later, Bosco, but right now it's time to get up close and personal with that oversized evildoer.
[28:19.73]We need to now find out what's going on with you.
[28:26.23]Did he just steal something?
[28:27.17]What is... Why are you so fast?
[28:29.25]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[28:33.15]Free videos?
[28:34.11]Don't mind if I do.
[28:35.65]Brady Coulter's Eye Bowl for Ocular Fitness.
[28:38.95]The revolutionary eye-symmetric exercise.
[28:42.24]What's so revolutionary about it?
[28:44.36]See through walls and clothing.
[28:46.24]Roll your eyes at lightning speed.
[28:48.24]Lose five pounds of eyeball fat.
[28:50.82]Oh, good.
[28:51.46]I can never seem to lose that last five pounds.
[28:54.07]What do you say we start off this movie night a little early today?
[28:56.91]So let's get rid of these and watch it.
[29:01.80]Alright, eyeball video.
[29:02.78]Do I have to buy one, or do I have to, can I steal it?
[29:05.20]Why would I steal one?
[29:06.62]I can get it from you.
[29:08.08]My coffee machine.
[29:09.36]I think it's the tinge of green that makes this coffee especially appealing.
[29:13.38]I take my coffee green, like my men.
[29:15.30]I don't even know.
[29:22.16]With 100% all natural sludge.
[29:24.68]This week's flavors, wheatgrass and meatloaf.
[29:27.95]Wheatgrass and meatloaf smoothies.
[29:29.89]Alright, I'll tell you.
[29:32.35]one of those doesn't sound too bad I'm not going to tell you which one it could be either one of them max I've got a great idea involving you a microwave and six feet of aluminum foil go on maybe another time am I implying that I'm gonna put that rabbit in the microwave and turn it on nachos they're mine nachos
[29:57.00]Oh, yuck.
[29:58.10]Yuck.
[29:59.38]That was a yuck joke.
[30:00.82]I need to hear it again.
[30:01.48]Oh, yuck.
[30:02.39]Purple stuff.
[30:03.17]Purple ketchup?
[30:05.39]Bring it back.
[30:06.17]I remember it was cool.
[30:20.75]Your brain made it taste like, um, it tasted like blueberries.
[30:25.97]Your brain made you taste it.
[30:28.27]It was like blueberry ketchup.
[30:29.30]Even though there was no blueberry in it, your brain just made it taste that way.
[30:33.24]Hey there, Mr. Whizzer.
[30:34.68]No need to be formal.
[30:36.20]My friends just call me Whizzer.
[30:38.26]And so do my enemies and lots of people like you I've never met.
[30:42.03]Everyone calls me Whizzer.
[30:43.89]It was the chemicals.
[30:45.55]Yeah, I know.
[30:46.73]I'm not saying it wasn't.
[30:50.73]Everybody loves your show.
[30:52.40]My cousin's wife's dentist loved your show.
[30:55.10]Oh, yeah.
[30:55.80]We've always been a big hit with the dentists.
[30:58.66]Gee, I wonder why.
[30:59.98]Hey, kids, guzzle soda like the soda poppers, and you'll need so much expensive dental work, you can kiss college goodbye.
[31:06.46]So these are the soda poppers.
[31:07.22]Max, your unbridled cynicism is like a breath of fresh air on a crowded subway.
[31:13.20]Are you anything like your character?
[31:14.86]So are they like the, is this like Snow White and the seven soda poppers?
[31:25.19]Any chance we could get you to sing the song from your old show?
[31:27.97]Yeah, the theme song.
[31:29.23]What was it called?
[31:30.44]It was called More Than Jerks.
[31:32.48]But I can't sing it.
[31:33.90]I'm too embarrassed.
[31:34.80]Let's do it.
[31:38.16]Come on, sing the Soda Popper theme song.
[31:40.94]No, I don't think so.
[31:42.92]Do the voice.
[31:43.55]Do the character.
[31:44.59]Do it.
[31:44.91]How about an autograph for my pal, Max?
[31:49.52]Huh.
[32:10.94]Are you anything like the character you played on the TV show?
[32:13.82]Yeah, like do you really have to hit the John every five minutes?
[32:16.86]Sometimes every three minutes.
[32:18.73]It's like having a superpower.
[32:21.05]Pee every three minutes?
[32:23.79]This really is me.
[32:25.73]Well, that's nice.
[32:27.01]What is?
[32:30.35]What exactly are you doing here?
[32:32.29]Delivering videos.
[32:33.59]Take one.
[32:34.19]They're free.
[32:35.27]Here we go.
[32:38.81]What's the story with these videos?
[32:40.92]Brady Cultures Eyebow is the ocular fitness regimen for people on the go.
[32:45.76]It's gonna be like a hypnotizing program where you get like all fucked up and it makes you paint, um... I was gonna say giraffes, but it's graffiti, that's the word.
[32:55.79]There's a lot of G's and a lot of F's in both those words.
[33:01.17]What can you tell me about Eyebow?
[33:04.69]Yeah, giraffe feeding.
[33:06.75]Giraffe feeding.
[33:07.81]Alright.
[33:23.93]Who exactly is this Brady Culture fellow supposed to be?
[33:26.87]And what kind of steroids does he use on his hair?
[33:29.49]Brady Culture is a genius, and his eyeball program is a boon to all mankind.
[33:34.13]Settle down, Jeremy.
[33:34.81]You got the fucking, you got the intelligence like a large glass of water.
[33:39.29]12 ounce IQ.
[33:41.41]That's mine, by the way.
[33:43.44]I said that in pre-stream chat.
[33:44.96]It's a child star bonanza.
[33:50.66]I failed it.
[33:51.14]I was waiting.
[33:53.56]I was waiting for an opportunity to use it.
[33:57.28]Hey, you know, you're brilliant.
[33:59.08]No, you're brilliant.
[33:59.76]You got the fucking IQ like a glass of water.
[34:01.67]And then they're going to be like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[34:04.51]And then on the car ride home, the car ride home, they're going to be going, whoa, fucking like 16 ounces, that motherfucker.
[34:18.38]Well, that's nice.
[34:19.82]What is?
[34:24.22]If you'll excuse us, we've got shopping to do.
[34:26.62]Take a copy of the AIBO video while you're at it.
[34:29.62]It will change your life.
[34:31.06]We were talking about that in the pre-stream chat.
[34:33.36]I'm glad I got a chance to say it.
[34:38.46]12 ounce IQ.
[34:39.10]Alright, so did I get a video?
[34:44.53]Alright, good.
[34:50.68]That joke is horrible.
[34:51.82]It doesn't matter.
[34:52.44]I needed to say it.
[34:53.96]I am not getting in that thing again.
[34:56.22]It took me weeks to get the fishy smell out of my fur.
[35:01.44]Tongues placed on freezer become property of Bosco.
[35:03.94]I got quite a few tongues that week.
[35:08.95]Public restrooms.
[35:10.07]Unholy temples to all things unsanitary.
[35:12.85]I wouldn't go in there for all the tea and tea-landia.
[35:15.27]I'll do it.
[35:16.49]Tea-landia.
[35:20.11]Lots of terror.
[35:23.13]He's gonna pee his pants?
[35:26.11]Extreme terror.
[35:27.91]Alright, well, hold on.
[35:30.62]He's not over here anymore.
[35:32.36]Can we go over here?
[35:35.06]I mean, he's in the bathroom right now.
[35:36.72]I wonder if I can do something.
[35:50.51]Grandma only uses... I don't... I don't like to use public restrooms, actually.
[35:55.76]Landmines?
[35:56.30]What the fuck?
[35:56.94]Children preserve fluids.
[35:58.84]I wonder if Bosco used the fluid sample I submitted.
[36:02.10]I hope not.
[36:02.68]So what would I go... I got... Boxing glove bowling ball.
[36:15.63]Yeah, hold on.
[36:17.63]Get back, uh... Get back in there.
[36:19.69]Ooh, fun!
[36:30.44]Can I put like a bowling ball in here?
[36:36.74]Like weigh him down?
[36:37.54]I was trying to like plant the gun in there.
[36:42.62]I don't know why.
[36:57.13]Why would I want to, like, plant a gun?
[36:58.75]Never mind.
[37:02.47]Okay, so... I'm not sure I can do anything here.
[37:05.35]Because... That's what he used to deliver...
[37:26.53]I think I'm gonna have to probably do... I'm probably gonna have to put a tape... Okay.
[37:35.38]I'm gonna have to put a tape in here.
[37:37.48]So he delivers it somewhere, right?
[37:45.03]Oh, hold on.
[37:45.65]Sliced cheese.
[37:47.29]Well, it is on special.
[37:52.50]Did I take it?
[37:54.65]Cheddar cheese this time.
[37:56.01]Okay.
[37:56.71]A cheese sign on an empty table.
[37:58.65]The tantalizing promise of cheese crushed by cruel reality.
[38:04.93]Lottery tickets.
[38:06.51]$1 lottery tickets.
[38:07.23]$2.
[38:07.43]I'm feeling lucky already.
[38:13.73]Hmm.
[38:13.99]Is that clock correct?
[38:15.85]Well, it's only got one hand, so probably not.
[38:17.89]No, there was a minute hand.
[38:23.41]No trash?
[38:23.71]Hot weenies.
[38:24.05]Have I ever played Monkey Island?
[38:25.03]I have played Monkey Island before.
[38:28.46]What do we have here?
[38:29.50]Organ trader?
[38:29.94]Self-loading weekly?
[38:30.42]Oh, let me see that.
[38:31.56]Hey Bosco, what can I do for you?
[38:49.53]Alright, uh, we wanna, we wanna buy something.
[38:50.63]Uh, the cheese plate.
[38:51.13]I just already, wait, I already bought it.
[39:13.80]What have you got?
[39:14.84]Well, I still got that big sale on cheese.
[39:17.83]Oh, yeah, cheese.
[39:18.69]I want that.
[39:19.79]And I might have another item of interest behind the counter.
[39:23.67]What do you got behind the counter?
[39:24.71]What spot is it?
[39:25.47]I accept your thinly-veiled invitation to ask about the item behind the counter.
[39:29.88]Oh, it's just a little something I like to call a tear gas grenade launcher.
[39:33.38]Tear gas grenade launcher?
[39:34.94]Oh yeah, I really want that.
[39:36.94]It's the latest in Bosco tech innovation.
[39:39.57]It'll clear out a room of militant college students in no time.
[39:43.21]Guaranteed.
[39:44.43]I feel really close to you right now.
[39:49.23]You sell cheese and a tear gas grenade launcher.
[39:55.68]Do you have any weasels on a stick?
[39:57.84]Nope.
[40:01.41]Do you have any two-handed broadswords?
[40:03.77]Nope.
[40:05.43]Do you have any vegetables in the shape of famous naturalists?
[40:09.01]Nope.
[40:10.99]Do you have any candy pink fat boys?
[40:13.39]Nope.
[40:14.89]Do you have any exiled political dissidents?
[40:17.43]Nope.
[40:19.05]Do you have any weapons of mass destruction?
[40:21.49]Who's asking?
[40:24.85]Topical!
[40:25.57]Topical humor!
[40:27.95]Topical!
[40:28.83]I've run out of ideas.
[40:30.29]Well, you can always just start over again.
[40:32.45]Good idea.
[40:32.89]Start over.
[40:33.87]Do you have any weasels on a stick?
[40:39.41]Nope.
[40:41.87]2002, 2004 topical.
[40:48.33]I already took the cheese, though, didn't I?
[40:49.81]Did I have to pay for it?
[40:55.91]Okay, Mac, we want this cheese.
[40:57.85]Okay.
[40:58.65]Standard cheese background check.
[41:00.33]I'll need to see at least six forms of ID, a valid federal cheese license, a completed organ donor card, a written release signed in the presence of a notary public, and your school report cards from the 9th through 12th grade.
[41:11.22]Uh-oh.
[41:12.26]I can do all of those except for the last one.
[41:14.16]It's okay, Sam.
[41:15.36]I can be brave.
[41:16.54]We'll just have to struggle cheeselessly onward.
[41:18.98]Do you guys remember bringing in your report card into Chuck E. Cheese?
[41:25.49]You guys ever have that deal?
[41:26.53]Where if you had, like, A's?
[41:31.06]Yeah, Chuck E. Cheese used to do this thing, like 10, 20 years ago, where if you brought in your report card and you had A's,
[41:38.82]Straight A's.
[41:40.36]They would give you free tokens.
[41:42.25]They would give you bonus tokens.
[41:45.47]So... But what they didn't tell you is that really didn't matter.
[41:49.99]Because they didn't want anybody to feel bad.
[41:51.87]So we would go in.
[41:52.85]My mother... I was a bad student.
[41:54.69]So I didn't get like A... It wasn't A's and B's, by the way.
[41:57.50]It was like S or something for satisfactory needs improvement.
[42:02.36]There were only like three grades.
[42:04.04]A for like accomplished or something.
[42:06.66]So I had a terrible report card, but we still wanted to go to Chuck E. Cheese and we would go and my mother would still try to get them to give the bonus credits for having a good report card.
[42:17.49]And the guy behind the counter just didn't give a shit.
[42:19.58]So they felt bad because they would get my brother's report card and be like, oh, he's doing great.
[42:24.34]Free, 20 free tokens.
[42:26.46]And then they'd get mine, and you could see the guy's face just be... Ugh... Hey!
[42:33.05]Syke, uh, good for you!
[42:35.09]20 free tokens!
[42:38.49]I just got- I got them just because they felt that.
[42:44.83]And I don't know, maybe- maybe my mother was like, You- you give him both that, you understand?
[42:50.74]I don't want him thinking that he's, like, fucking inadequate.
[42:54.60]And the guy's just like, okay.
[43:00.63]But yeah, Chuck E. Cheese actually used to do that.
[43:05.75]We'd like that tear gas grenade launcher.
[43:07.70]That's really sad.
[43:08.92]What?
[43:09.02]10,000 bucks?
[43:09.90]Is it sad?
[43:10.72]I want to give out like a million tickets.
[43:14.12]But I didn't know.
[43:15.02]I just thought we got free tokens.
[43:16.30]White collar crime drive.
[43:18.12]Where corporate criminals go to rejoice in their ill-gotten gains.
[43:22.20]After we blow this popsicle stand, we can go hunt us up one of those starchy cesspiles and hit them where it hurts the most.
[43:28.14]Right in the pocketbook.
[43:29.68]That's not what I thought you were gonna say, but that's good too.
[43:37.52]The man got his tokens, still a victory, that's right!
[43:41.18]I still got the tokens!
[43:45.30]Look, my brother was really smart, and he like, paid the token toll.
[43:49.00]And then we just, we're all part of the same family, same group, just give it to us all, whatever!
[43:56.12]Alright, so I can't... Okay.
[43:58.00]Nothing for us right now.
[43:59.40]I got the cheese.
[44:00.54]Can I put the cheese in here?
[44:01.70]See you later, Bosco.
[44:03.11]Remember... What conversation?
[44:05.91]The conversation we just had.
[44:07.29]I just accidentally skipped that.
[44:09.03]He's leeching off his brother.
[44:11.52]What conversation?
[44:13.02]Oh, brother.
[44:18.55]This is like a dumb, like, $4 extra promotion to Chuck E. Cheese 20 years ago.
[44:25.01]Oh, wow, I can't believe he did that to his brother.
[44:27.05]Unbelievable.
[44:30.13]He, like, conned his brother out of tokens.
[44:34.11]Uh-oh.
[44:41.35]Time out for number one.
[44:45.51]Alright, can I put the cheese in here?
[44:52.26]If you really love someone, give them the cheese.
[44:54.48]What does that do?
[44:56.06]I just can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets it.
[45:03.70]Oh, he's trying to leave.
[45:05.14]I get it.
[45:05.72]Time out for number one.
[45:08.84]We're saved!
[45:10.28]That's a whole lot more entertaining when it's not happening to me.
[45:13.14]It's pretty entertaining either way.
[45:16.30]Is that Sam?
[45:17.96]I was like, what the fuck?
[45:19.42]Let me help you out here.
[45:20.20]Did it for you.
[45:57.54]Actually evil.
[46:00.84]So is it- that's it?
[46:02.38]I don't want to wake him up.
[46:03.86]I got the- we have to go watch the tape.
[46:06.94]Nothing else I can do over here?
[46:10.32]Bosco's got a lot of interesting, if questionable, products in here.
[46:13.76]I think it's the only store in town where they carry those albino monkey crackers I got hooked on in Borneo.
[46:20.40]I'll let you get back to your shopping.
[46:22.72]Or whatever it was you were doing.
[46:24.65]Sometimes it's best not to ask.
[46:27.79]I'll let you get back to doing what you're doing.
[46:29.37]Or whatever it is you do back there.
[46:32.97]Hey, Boschko, how are you?
[46:34.17]No, that's like Owen Wilson.
[46:36.09]Hey, Boschko.
[46:37.18]Hey, you just gonna leave him there?
[46:45.06]Close.
[46:45.70]I'll get it.
[46:47.80]Um, how about a reward?
[46:49.10]You know, we did put the kibosh on that whole terrorist operation, so... How about some free stuff?
[46:54.76]Is that why you did this?
[46:56.52]For free stuff?
[46:57.70]Was this all a part of the plot?
[47:00.88]Yes, a labyrinthine scheme in which we paid off a former child star to deliver videos to your store just so that we could knock him out via your own security system and claim an undeserved reward.
[47:10.49]So you admit it.
[47:11.87]Conspiracy humor may be lost on this crowd.
[47:16.61]So we don't get anything.
[47:18.96]Nice place you got here.
[47:19.74]Where's our stuff?
[47:20.48]What's so nice about it?
[47:22.96]Nice... name.
[47:24.40]Nice security measures.
[47:25.38]Hey, you got a good security.
[47:26.44]What's with the maximum security prison motif?
[47:29.06]You'd been robbed as many times as I have, you do the same.
[47:32.73]I've never been robbed, actually.
[47:34.19]But then I typically point a large firearm at anyone who approaches me.
[47:37.85]You crack me up, little buddy.
[47:41.99]Why- that's a- that's- that... He didn't even laugh.
[47:49.66]I know, I mean, that's the line.
[47:51.06]I've heard, he said the line, right?
[47:52.84]I've heard that before.
[47:54.24]But he didn't laugh.
[47:59.36]Not even like a, ha ha ha.
[48:01.90]You crack me up, little buddy.
[48:03.44]No, no, no, he didn't laugh.
[48:04.80]He's a liar.
[48:06.40]What were we talking about?
[48:08.50]He's a liar.
[48:09.64]No, he's a liar.
[48:10.82]Sleep with two eyes open.
[48:13.25]He was being sarcastic?
[48:16.89]Oh, I didn't, I didn't!
[48:19.84]I get it!
[48:20.96]I get it!
[48:22.90]He's a liar.
[48:25.28]This game looks like Borderland.
[48:30.96]Hey, Specs.
[48:32.88]Hey, remember when we were friends?
[48:35.46]Um, okay, but let's watch the tape.
[48:36.71]Excuse us, we've got a- Don't we all?
[48:45.75]Any other things to click on?
[48:46.99]That's the office.
[48:47.71]What about over here?
[48:50.44]One way.
[48:51.48]One way, dead end.
[48:52.92]Street signs are such fitting metaphors for the human condition.
[48:56.23]Remind me to refill your prescriptions.
[48:59.57]Dead end sign.
[49:00.45]Let's go watch the tape.
[49:04.76]They say graffiti is the poetry of our time.
[49:06.86]I keep seeing giraffe, like giraffe-y giraffe.
[49:11.64]I see the word giraffe.
[49:12.48]It's the font that's making me do that.
[49:19.25]It's the same word.
[49:22.39]Without the T's or something.
[49:27.58]Or something.
[49:29.40]Let's watch the tape before I make a fool out of myself even more.
[49:34.40]Okay, Max.
[49:35.22]Ready for that ocular workout?
[49:36.66]No!
[49:37.18]Stop!
[49:38.22]We don't have any popcorn.
[49:39.66]Sweet alligator dentures soaking in formaldehyde.
[49:41.78]That was close.
[49:42.96]Quick, before it starts.
[49:46.60]Hello, I'm Brady Culture.
[49:48.92]You may remember me from Culture's Clubhouse, the massive worldwide television hit that ran for six episodes in 1970.
[49:57.49]What you are about to see will change your life forever.
[50:02.11]So watch closely.
[50:04.49]Listen up, you tasteless Philistines!
[50:08.45]I knew, I told you it was gonna be a hypnosis thing.
[50:10.25]You adore me.
[50:12.51]You want to name all your children after me.
[50:16.75]I love you.
[50:18.75]I adore you.
[50:20.77]I want to name all my children after you.
[50:24.07]Sam, look!
[50:25.05]Ocular fitness, my eye.
[50:26.89]That videotape hypnotized Jimmy Two-Teeth.
[50:29.55]I think I like him better this way.
[50:31.25]We've got to find this brainy culture and stop it before he hypnotizes every consumer of cheap self-help videos.
[50:37.61]Can I have his hair when we're done?
[50:39.36]Only if you keep it on a leash.
[50:40.50]Alright.
[50:43.45]Now time for some investigative work here.
[50:46.17]Let's check the answering machine.
[50:48.41]Can I call somebody?
[50:52.44]Can I call the chief?
[50:55.28]You know, that's been a meme ever since the Ninja Turtles.
[51:04.21]Anchovies on pizza.
[51:06.49]But I've been told that it's actually fantastic.
[51:16.44]That's the joke, right?
[51:17.74]Anchovies!
[51:18.44]Blah!
[51:19.46]Apparently it's really, really good.
[51:27.92]Okay, so what?
[51:28.60]Can I take the tape back out?
[51:29.92]This is evidence, right?
[51:33.93]I need to hold on to this.
[51:36.21]Alright, so we know that this is a plot to hypnotize everybody and cause problems, so...
[51:43.88]Anchovies on pizza are very normal here in Italy, and are one of the classic pizzas in Napoli.
[51:48.35]Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying.
[51:49.23]Like, I don't know where this meme joke came from.
[51:52.05]Uh, okay, there's another, uh, there's another giraffe, there's another giraffe-ity over there.
[52:09.11]Fishes are stinky and yucky, mean no want.
[52:13.33]They say graffiti is the poetry of our time.
[52:15.87]Just what we need.
[52:16.93]More lame poetry.
[52:20.73]It's not a meme.
[52:21.69]They just don't taste good.
[52:26.29]Meme is the word that everybody uses now.
[52:28.49]I would... I'm just trying to fit in.
[52:33.42]This place used to be Lefty's tool rental shop.
[52:35.92]Good old Lefty.
[52:37.10]I'll miss him.
[52:38.18]You couldn't stand Lefty.
[52:39.64]He once poked him in the eye with a number three socket spanner.
[52:42.54]exactly good times how do you do fellow kids spray paint hey a can of spray paint and it's not even empty so are we gonna go with these paintings spray over it this could use a little improvement
[53:16.06]Okay, so that takes me away from the other one.
[53:24.69]What was he doing on the other one?
[53:26.55]Was he guarding something?
[53:35.16]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[53:36.96]I don't know.
[53:37.90]They say graffiti is the poetry of our time.
[53:40.74]You guys, like, got me all messed up with that.
[53:48.81]I keep seeing that, and I just remember how many times I said it.
[53:51.33]Okay, so I can move him around.
[53:55.67]So he's going to fix that one.
[53:57.75]He'll run over and fix this one.
[54:12.13]Okay, so in Stand Here, he goes really fast.
[54:14.43]I'm going to hold the boxing glove out, and he's going to run into my fist.
[54:18.09]And he's going to break his, like, he's going to fall down, and it's going to hurt him.
[54:21.77]But I didn't do it, though.
[54:22.71]He just wasn't looking where he was going.
[54:36.16]Let's go first.
[54:36.68]Let me go in here first.
[54:40.16]Tempering with the mail is a federal offense punishable by fine and imprisonment.
[54:44.64]As we found out after the incident with the garden hose, our memories... I heard it was a little loud, so I'm turning it down.
[54:59.02]Okay, mailbox.
[55:00.64]This is Sybil's Piercings Tattoo Psychic Therapy.
[55:07.96]Save it?
[55:11.65]Okay.
[55:14.16]Now it's too quiet.
[55:18.00]Oh, let me check the alleyway here.
[55:22.76]Is there any alley?
[55:23.52]No?
[55:24.58]No.
[55:31.17]There's a car.
[55:38.81]Let's go give a ticket to a rich criminal.
[55:44.11]Let's go cruise for lawbreakers, Max.
[55:46.13]Drive around?
[55:46.73]Are we getting a full letter grade here?
[55:49.91]Is that possible?
[55:58.16]No.
[55:59.30]By the way, Sam, I'm not sure if I mentioned this, but I may have accidentally chewed through our brake lines.
[56:04.56]No, I don't think you did mention that.
[56:06.76]I guess we'll just have to slow down by violently rear-ending other motorists.
[56:10.81]Already planning on it, little buddy.
[56:18.08]How do I... Oh, no, it is plus a full letter grade.
[56:23.41]Okay.
[56:23.67]Is there any consequences?
[56:29.95]Are there no consequences?
[56:37.23]Hey, why can I do this?
[56:44.45]What?
[56:44.77]This is so... Where am I supposed to go?
[56:46.31]Okay, I just crashed into that guy.
[56:52.17]I'm just on the other side of the road.
[57:19.09]Office.
[57:20.23]I don't have anywhere else to go.
[57:21.33]You can use the keyboard to move.
[57:26.36]WASD doesn't do anything.
[57:28.38]Up, down, left, right doesn't do anything.
[57:29.72]I think this is... I don't have a... I only have one destination, which is the office area.
[57:49.37]Alright, that was pretty sick.
[57:52.17]We just drove around in a circle.
[57:57.64]Okay.
[57:59.94]So I gotta deal with this guy.
[58:01.36]Somehow.
[58:05.34]Can I go?
[58:05.82]I'm gonna go into Sibyl's.
[58:13.43]Liver and onions live.
[58:17.39]Not a great name.
[58:26.18]Another one.
[58:29.24]Welcome.
[58:30.14]You look like you could use some therapy.
[58:32.76]Not from a wide-eyed circus freak like you.
[58:35.23]Hey, it's another one of the soda poppers.
[58:37.49]Me?
[58:38.63]Right.
[58:39.05]You're, uh... Peepers.
[58:40.87]I don't know what you're talking about.
[58:43.69]My name is Sybil Pandemic, licensed psychotherapist.
[58:50.47]Fine.
[58:50.81]Prove about a little analysis.
[58:52.67]Certainly.
[58:53.87]Tell me what's bothering you.
[59:02.93]It's not me, it's Max.
[59:04.55]Hey!
[59:05.37]He thinks he's a rabbit.
[59:06.99]I am a rabbit!
[59:08.29]See?
[59:09.01]Yes, well, I would recommend Brady Culture's AIBO video for this situation.
[59:14.14]Good eye health helps combat delusions.
[59:17.84]I'm a rabbit!
[59:18.92]AIBO?
[59:19.60]Yes, my runny, poached, egg-like eyes could use a workout.
[59:23.18]You won't regret it!
[59:26.70]okay well we already know what this is who's this lady culture person brady brady culture he's only the most insightful and amazing man of the planet that's all it's not Sean penn not anymore I'm so disillusioned
[59:45.51]Alright.
[59:46.09]I know.
[59:46.55]I got the video.
[59:47.13]Let me just... Have you got a copy of this cockamamie video?
[59:50.39]I'm all out, but they probably still... Yeah.
[59:54.03]Yeah.
[59:55.31]Well, you're not Sybil.
[59:56.59]Are you sure your name is Sybil, not Peepers?
[59:59.42]Absolutely.
[60:00.94]Sybil Pandemic, licensed psychotherapist.
[60:03.86]That's me.
[60:05.02]He's trying to pull a fast one, Sam.
[60:06.78]Where's your gun?
[60:08.08]Violence is not the answer.
[60:10.58]Those eyes.
[60:11.72]Sam, we're dealing with a dangerously delusional psychotic here.
[60:15.57]Obviously.
[60:19.19]Uh, we'll do all the options.
[60:21.01]Sybil's normally a girl's name, isn't it?
[60:23.17]Must have been tough while you were growing up.
[60:25.40]Why do you think I became a licensed psychotherapist?
[60:28.24]You have any ID?
[60:30.52]Could we see your driver's license or some sort of ID?
[60:33.65]Sybil.
[60:34.47]My psychotherapy license is hanging over there on the wall.
[60:38.41]How about something with a picture on it, you obvious lunatic, you?
[60:41.91]I could draw one on there if it would put your mind at ease.
[60:45.56]Draw one.
[60:46.10]Oddly, I don't think it would.
[60:49.30]You sure look like Peepers.
[60:50.94]You're a Dead Ringer for Peepers from that old Soda Popper show.
[60:54.32]I get that a lot, but I'm civil pandemic licensed psychotherapist.
[60:59.25]Right.
[61:03.25]Excuse me for a minute, would you?
[61:04.82]Let's take a look around.
[61:08.86]Diplomas.
[61:10.48]Tattoo chair.
[61:11.44]What do I have for items?
[61:14.90]Punching bag.
[61:15.60]Bowling ball.
[61:18.46]Spray paint.
[61:21.08]It's eerily lifelike for a fake plant.
[61:23.36]The same could be said for a lot of our friends.
[61:28.70]It's eerily lifelike for... Yep, yep, yep.
[61:31.55]Alright.
[61:31.87]What about the desk?
[61:34.52]Newton's balls?
[61:38.19]Can I play with that?
[61:39.59]Ah, it's good exercise for the eyes, but Brady Culture's Eyebow video is better!
[61:46.65]Can I play with that?
[61:47.77]Ah, it's- That voice is, uh, familiar.
[61:55.16]Ah, the tiki.
[61:56.14]Pulled over from the days when you could sell all kinds of cheap crap without a successful children's television show.
[62:01.66]Envious?
[62:02.54]A little.
[62:03.82]okay intercom hello is anybody there can't check the desk uh what about okay I want to go in the in the closet there I think those might be iron-ons convenient and painful a surefire hit with the average consumer iron on tattoo that looks comfortable oh it is how would you know you don't have a tattoo don't I
[62:31.16]Relax.
[62:31.70]That may be the least relaxing sign I've ever seen.
[62:34.05]Relax.
[62:34.51]How about the one at the barbershop that says low fatality rate?
[62:38.09]I stand corrected.
[62:39.53]I would never let somebody shave me.
[62:41.65]I have this extreme fear of being shaved by somebody.
[62:45.29]No.
[62:45.67]Uh-uh.
[62:46.21]I don't think so.
[62:47.25]Skin art.
[62:48.39]Is that art for skin or art made from skin?
[62:52.16]Your ideas are effervescent pustules, Max.
[62:54.56]I have this extreme fear.
[62:56.54]And it's completely irrational.
[62:57.78]And you can judge me all you want.
[62:59.64]But I imagine myself sitting in the barber chair.
[63:02.43]And talking to whoever it is that's shaving me.
[63:05.37]Currently.
[63:06.73]And they just like... And I'm just dead.
[63:11.63]I don't know why.
[63:12.31]I just always think about that.
[63:20.35]It's completely irrational.
[63:25.90]Sweeney Todd, yeah, there's too many forms of media of that.
[63:34.85]Plus, I have a very sensitive face.
[63:37.79]I gotta be very careful, like... I use a very specific particular razor.
[63:45.36]If I go and do, like, a hot shave, and they're just like, here we go, and...
[63:52.73]I cut up there.
[63:53.91]I cut easily on my face.
[63:55.17]No, no.
[64:00.08]They get like the thing.
[64:01.62]They have a towel and they have that piece of leather that they take the big knife.
[64:07.15]It's like a machete and they go.
[64:11.75]Put your head back.
[64:21.84]It's scary.
[64:23.12]I'm sure it's nice.
[64:26.68]Thank God!
[64:27.50]I've been locked in that closet so long I was starting to invent life stories for the mothballs!
[64:31.54]The leather is the skin from the last guy they shaved.
[64:33.98]Oh my God!
[64:34.90]He's still here?
[64:35.94]Call a cop!
[64:36.72]You're in luck, ma'am.
[64:37.92]Sam and Max.
[64:38.98]We're freelance police.
[64:40.41]What the fuck?
[64:41.11]Civil pandemic.
[64:41.95]Licensed psychotherapist.
[64:43.03]Nice to know ya.
[64:44.01]Arrest that lunatic immediately!
[64:47.77]But he's my pal!
[64:51.40]What's the charge?
[64:52.56]Assault!
[64:53.30]Kidnapping!
[64:53.99]Identity theft!
[64:55.57]Those are good charges.
[64:57.05]Some of my favorites!
[64:58.21]And what about Mopary?
[64:59.74]He locked me in the closet, and he's been pretending he's me!
[65:03.98]Gadzooks.
[65:04.92]Why?
[65:05.84]Well, these cases can be very complicated and delicate.
[65:09.50]There may be repressed feelings of inadequate transference, or latent, unwarranted hypochondriac Freudianism.
[65:16.22]Come again?
[65:17.14]He's a complete whack job.
[65:18.86]Although, actually, now that I look closely, I think he's been hypnotized.
[65:24.32]Ooh, really?
[65:26.42]What can we do?
[65:27.12]Are there steps we can take?
[65:28.66]Soothing music, or perhaps some sort of invasive surgery?
[65:32.00]Shock treatment!
[65:32.84]Shock treatment!
[65:33.92]Typically, a hypnotic state can be revised after rendering the subject susceptible to new input.
[65:40.10]Sorry, I don't speak psychotherapist.
[65:42.40]You've got to knock them unconscious to bring them out of it.
[65:45.67]Knock them unconscious?
[65:46.89]Now you're talking!
[65:48.17]I can demonstrate on this guy if you'll knock him out for me.
[65:51.21]Consider it done.
[65:54.05]I thought he was just gonna go do it.
[65:54.93]Alright, so here.
[65:56.85]This is what we got this for.
[65:58.07]I can see you!
[66:00.56]Whoa!
[66:01.64]Where'd he go?
[66:02.30]Hey, there he is!
[66:03.98]You attacked a licensed psychotherapist?
[66:07.18]How could you?
[66:08.86]Just comes naturally, I guess.
[66:16.00]Okay, so we gotta knock him out.
[66:18.16]How do we knock you out?
[66:25.22]Whip the door open really fast and hit him right in the head with it?
[66:36.45]He runs?
[66:57.10]I can see!
[66:58.14]Whoa!
[66:58.74]Where'd he go?
[66:59.70]Hey, there he is!
[67:00.84]Alright, how do we keep him here?
[67:02.56]How do we keep him from moving?
[67:15.55]Where's he running to?
[67:16.39]I can see you!
[67:21.73]Please, stop!
[67:32.57]What can you tell me about this?
[67:34.19]Oh, it's marvelous.
[67:35.65]Changed my life.
[67:36.89]You should watch it as soon as you possibly can.
[67:39.37]I have the strangest urge to redecorate.
[67:46.00]Fight it, Sam.
[67:46.94]Fight it.
[67:47.30]Okay, let's spray him.
[67:53.78]I don't think that would be...
[67:59.18]Alright, well, what else are you gonna tell me?
[68:00.90]Hello!
[68:02.38]I meant the other Sybil.
[68:03.74]So, you guys gonna take care of this imposter, or what?
[68:06.72]Just throw the phone at him.
[68:11.74]I think there may be other victims of hypnosis besides yours lurking around the neighborhood.
[68:16.06]How'd it make that really, really cool phone-hitting sound?
[68:17.80]Well, see if you can knock them unconscious as well.
[68:19.92]Oh, boy!
[68:20.64]More gratuitous violence!
[68:21.30]When it comes off the latch, it goes like...
[68:25.75]It's a great audio cue for a lot of things.
[68:30.47]What happened to your tattoo business?
[68:32.43]Don't tell me they actually enforce those health code violations.
[68:35.71]No, no, of course they don't.
[68:37.36]But a guy came in here and asked me to put a ship on his chest and I misheard him and, well, I decided to hang it up after that.
[68:44.74]Okay.
[68:50.12]I don't think I've ever been in here.
[68:51.80]You're right across the street from us and I don't think I've ever been in here before today.
[68:55.78]Your friend has.
[68:56.92]He's always trying to con me into giving him some kind of weird tattoo for free.
[69:01.64]You could put a line on my head and some eyes on my butt and I'd look like I was upside down.
[69:06.41]For the last time, no.
[69:11.65]Excuse us, we've got work to do.
[69:13.55]I'll say.
[69:14.09]Alright, let me, what about the couch?
[69:18.69]Let me look at the couch.
[69:22.28]You crack me up sometimes, Max.
[69:32.30]You make me laugh, Max.
[69:34.17]Alright, let's get out of here.
[69:34.93]Let me try to deal with the other guy.
[69:39.29]I think I need something else.
[69:49.72]What do I have for items?
[69:51.45]Bowling ball, boxing glove, videotape, spray paint.
[69:54.63]So I can spray paint that.
[69:58.21]Can I go faster?
[70:03.03]Somebody said that I could double click.
[70:04.65]I can't.
[70:05.15]I'm not doing it.
[70:06.33]Because he's here and then he runs that way.
[70:18.03]What is he standing on here?
[70:19.01]Can I, like, drop him through this?
[70:25.38]Shift-click.
[70:27.24]No.
[70:32.75]Well, let me paint the graffiti here.
[70:34.77]Let's see what happens.
[70:36.77]That gets him away from there.
[70:42.96]But I'm not sure what that does.
[70:45.21]Because that just gets him over here.
[70:47.29]I think he missed his spot here.
[70:54.71]Excuse me.
[70:55.90]I thought I said... Okay.
[70:58.40]So now... I can't just, like, punch him in the back of the head.
[71:05.12]Caffeine rush!
[71:07.29]So they move so fast.
[71:08.39]Alright, so then...
[71:40.63]There's another one.
[71:41.27]Wait, there's two of them.
[71:42.07]There's one here, too.
[71:48.78]Okay, so there's three.
[71:56.65]Okay.
[71:57.07]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[72:10.79]I didn't, uh... I didn't see this.
[72:15.48]I forgot this one existed.
[72:16.32]Because then that means now he's over here.
[72:19.82]Okay, yeah.
[72:21.04]Watch this.
[72:32.41]Yep.
[72:33.21]He's gonna be right here.
[72:36.01]And that's when we shoot him.
[72:39.25]I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[72:41.20]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[72:47.78]Can you believe we get paid for this?
[72:50.72]I love this country.
[72:53.48]This would actually kill somebody.
[72:54.86]Like, he's dead.
[72:55.48]You made me mess up.
[72:58.04]That's the last words that person's ever gonna say.
[73:01.46]Now this is quality television.
[73:05.67]Except, hold on.
[73:07.49]My evil plan is in jeopardy.
[73:09.67]That person's skull crushed down into their spine.
[73:12.83]And their brain was disintegrated.
[73:14.59]That was pretty good.
[73:17.39]Better, better.
[73:18.99]Well, we've admired our handiwork long enough.
[73:21.45]Maybe just one more second.
[73:23.05]Okay, let's go.
[73:23.81]That's two.
[73:27.86]How do I knock out the third one?
[73:34.66]What do I got?
[73:36.78]It's definitely something to do with this.
[73:38.82]Something to do with the boxing glove.
[73:41.60]Put it somewhere that he runs into, or... Let me go look at the body.
[73:54.77]Whee!
[73:58.73]He'll be out for a good while.
[74:01.81]Yeah, forever, actually.
[74:03.87]It'll be out forever.
[74:04.81]Is there anything else down here?
[74:14.70]Takes me back to my childhood.
[74:16.60]Okay, we got more.
[74:17.60]We got Stinky's.
[74:22.12]Stinky's Diner.
[74:23.02]I can't go there.
[74:23.62]What about the van?
[74:24.58]Hmm.
[74:38.89]This guy's dead, too.
[74:39.85]What are you doing?
[74:44.01]Hey, Bosco.
[74:45.03]Hey, you just gonna leave him there?
[74:48.23]Uh... We wanna buy something.
[74:53.22]What do you got your eye on?
[74:56.74]We'd like that tear gas grenade launcher.
[74:58.78]That'll be $10,000.
[74:59.66]Oh, are you serious about that?
[75:02.42]It's a bargain.
[75:03.36]Trust me.
[75:03.94]Trust me.
[75:04.90]I never trust a man that says, trust me, twice.
[75:07.33]We gotta find an illegally wealthy motorist, and quick!
[75:12.34]Nothing for real.
[75:13.32]Okay.
[75:14.32]So we gotta go arrest somebody for money, and then get the money and get the tear gas.
[75:25.96]How am I gonna get $10,000 in tickets?
[75:39.48]Just one big ticket.
[75:42.57]Where are we going, Sam?
[75:43.21]That's a lot.
[75:44.51]Alright, let's go get a ticket.
[75:45.63]That's what that's for.
[75:46.29]Let's go Crucial Operators, Max.
[75:47.85]Goody!
[75:49.75]Alright, here we go.
[76:00.90]OK, so we've got to pull over somewhere by running into them.
[76:06.10]Like this guy.
[76:08.24]Alright, you're under arrest.
[76:10.08]Click on the report card.
[76:14.65]Get tokens!
[76:15.35]Hideously broken taillight.
[76:35.22]Indecent exposure.
[76:37.56]We're booking you, sorry Hyde, for indecent exposure.
[76:40.64]What are you talking about?
[76:42.18]I'm fully clothed.
[76:43.86]Except your face.
[76:45.00]Get a veil, please.
[76:46.34]Let's go, Max.
[76:47.35]Having that face is punishment enough.
[76:51.73]That's two cops.
[76:52.99]Did two police officers say that to you?
[76:55.19]No one seems to be breaking the law today.
[76:57.03]I know.
[76:57.93]What's the problem?
[76:59.05]Start committing some crimes, you sick bunch of reprobates.
[77:02.34]Hey, you're naked.
[77:03.38]No, I'm not.
[77:04.24]Well, you're ugly.
[77:04.96]Bye.
[77:05.92]Okay.
[77:06.90]Have a nice day, officer.
[77:07.92]Jesus.
[77:18.77]What about you?
[77:26.54]I just ran something over him.
[77:32.43]Greetings, anonymous motorist.
[77:34.51]If you were planning to bribe us, now would be the appropriate time.
[77:37.81]What's the chart?
[77:41.40]Uh, hideously broken... Worshipping false idols.
[77:44.04]Ferret impression.
[77:45.96]This is no nothing at all.
[77:47.48]Uh, broken taillight.
[77:48.42]Your taillight's busted.
[77:49.96]No, it isn't.
[77:51.12]Well, maybe it should be.
[77:52.52]Mental note.
[77:53.42]Try to pull over suspects who are actually guilty of something.
[78:06.15]What terrible cops.
[78:09.39]Imagine a cop had to make a mental note out loud in front of you that you didn't do anything wrong and they need to call the people that did things wrong.
[78:20.16]Well, how am I supposed to tell?
[78:21.16]Who's doing something illegal?
[78:26.60]We're doing illegal shit.
[78:28.60]Nobody else is.
[78:34.56]I can't, like, break it?
[78:35.60]That didn't break his taillight?
[78:42.88]How is me crashing into somebody not break their taillight?
[78:45.34]Sam 1, taillight 0.
[78:56.59]Wow.
[78:56.73]I could do this all day.
[79:05.45]Pull over, you have two broken taillights.
[79:14.06]Pull over!
[79:15.02]Don't worry, we just want to talk.
[79:22.50]Hello, sir.
[79:23.34]Or madam.
[79:24.37]You're in big trouble, mister.
[79:25.97]Or miss.
[79:26.97]Or what?
[79:30.11]Your taillight's busted.
[79:31.61]you're the ones who broke it your point being hmm what's the fine for a broken taillight ten thousand dollars ten thousand dollars what are you crazy what oh wow one moment allow me to confer with my legal counsel my attorney has advised me to pay the fine wait what kind of inflation economy to do thanks sucker
[80:05.38]What a bad... Jesus.
[80:10.59]Alright.
[80:16.65]Got ten grand.
[80:24.44]Yeah, you gotta figure, if you would just pay that fine, something fucked up is really going on in your current life.
[80:33.72]You will have to be, like, a super criminal.
[80:36.96]This is probably, like, $500,000 worth of cocaine in that person's car or something.
[80:45.17]I got a million dollars in fucking, like, cocaine in this car.
[80:49.21]That'll be $10,000.
[80:49.51]Okay, yeah.
[80:50.03]Does it mean you're gonna leave me alone?
[80:52.51]Yeah.
[80:53.07]Okay, bye.
[80:58.83]That's the only reason why that makes sense.
[81:05.32]We want to buy something.
[81:06.90]What do you got your eye on?
[81:10.18]We got your tear gas money right here.
[81:12.36]Really?
[81:13.11]Alright, here you go.
[81:14.31]One tear gas grenade launcher.
[81:17.59]This is a salad shooter filled with onions.
[81:20.39]But it works.
[81:21.17]Trust me, trust me.
[81:22.49]Now put that away before someone gets hurt.
[81:24.79]What do you need?
[81:28.36]The 10,000 just covered the cost of materials, you know.
[81:31.32]Oh, I'm sure.
[81:32.20]It's okay, everybody.
[81:33.74]I'm alright.
[81:37.06]Well, you knew there was a kind of, there had to be a gag there somewhere.
[81:45.81]It's an onion.
[81:46.95]It's a salad.
[81:47.77]It's an onion shooter.
[81:50.13]It's tear gas.
[81:53.17]It'll make you cry.
[81:54.21]And then we shoot this at the, shoot the onion at the pauper's face.
[82:02.17]Watch him cry and then punch him.
[82:11.03]Is this just going to be a one-off, or am I going to play the rest of the game?
[82:15.55]I'm open to play the rest of the season.
[82:22.71]This is cool.
[82:23.23]I'm just hanging out.
[82:25.09]It's like a relaxing little experience.
[82:26.76]Yeah, I like it.
[82:29.64]Oh, Sybil?
[82:30.54]Yes?
[82:31.70]The other Sybil.
[82:32.80]What is that?
[82:34.08]Don't worry.
[82:34.64]This won't hurt a bit.
[82:35.42]No!
[82:39.55]But it will make you cry.
[82:43.63]He's already crying.
[82:50.65]I can see you.
[82:52.41]What?
[82:53.21]There he is.
[82:55.23]You attacked a licensed cycle.
[82:57.92]Just comes naturally.
[83:00.84]They got a big failsafe in the game's engine here to make that not possible.
[83:06.60]Oh, Sybil.
[83:08.28]Please, Sam, allow me.
[83:19.72]Now, Peepers, this is going to hurt us a lot more than it's going to hurt you.
[83:23.46]Just kidding.
[83:24.32]It'll definitely hurt you more.
[83:27.00]Sweet dreams, Peeps.
[83:29.34]I can see you.
[83:31.94]Oh, my, that was great.
[83:33.64]That was great.
[83:35.50]Wait a second.
[83:36.98]My evil plan is in ruins.
[83:39.30]The dog and bunny will rue the day they crossed me.
[83:42.88]Rue the day, I say.
[83:44.96]That was good.
[83:49.89]Nice work, you two.
[83:51.63]Now I can try to bring him out of his hypnotic state.
[83:55.31]Take control of your mind.
[83:57.19]I don't think he can hear you.
[83:59.30]Sure he can.
[84:00.30]He's unconscious, not dead.
[84:02.72]Minor detail.
[84:03.96]Destroy the intruder in your dreams.
[84:06.70]Regain control.
[84:08.70]What?
[84:09.37]Hey, what am I doing here?
[84:11.85]What's going on?
[84:13.94]Can we get him to sing the song?
[84:15.24]My name's not Sibyl, it's Peepers!
[84:19.44]Yes, it is.
[84:20.80]Are you okay?
[84:21.72]How do you feel?
[84:23.00]I've got a bit of a headache.
[84:25.36]I had the weirdest dream.
[84:28.04]And there was someone unusual in your dream, wasn't there?
[84:32.17]Yes, Brady Culture was there.
[84:34.67]He kept telling me to do stuff.
[84:37.95]Five o'clock shadow?
[84:38.97]I thought he was like huffing spray paint.
[85:08.48]Witness him.
[85:09.58]Alright, let's do it.
[85:10.78]So wait, isn't there anything else I can do in here?
[85:38.63]Do you have anything else for me?
[85:39.57]Hey, Doc.
[85:40.49]Hey, Sam.
[85:41.23]Thanks for taking care of that wacko.
[85:43.43]Uh, we could use another 10 grand.
[85:46.33]Have you got 10 grand?
[85:47.63]I'm new at this.
[85:48.53]I have a lot of student loans.
[85:50.49]Great!
[85:50.97]Loan us a student.
[85:52.03]I can ride it around like a pony.
[85:53.95]It's nice to see you show such enthusiasm.
[85:56.46]Security.
[85:59.68]You don't have security back there.
[86:01.28]That button's not connected to anything.
[86:04.20]Max might like a tattoo.
[86:05.74]Ooh, yeah!
[86:06.42]I want a map of the Netherlands on my Netherlands.
[86:09.54]I get the cold shivers just thinking about remembering hearing you say that.
[86:13.11]I'm out of the tattoo business anyway.
[86:15.27]I'm a licensed psychotherapist.
[86:18.85]Can you fix cars?
[86:20.21]Ours sometimes makes a noise like an orangutan with the dry heaves.
[86:23.69]Um, that's my fault.
[86:24.86]I've been keeping an orangutan in the trunk.
[86:27.14]Oh, never mind.
[86:28.48]I'm not much of a mechanic anyway, except with unicycles.
[86:33.96]I suppose you could psychoanalyze me.
[86:36.32]Hey, yeah, I could count your marbles for you.
[86:38.82]I have a license, you know.
[86:40.18]Will this be painful?
[86:41.76]Only if we do it right.
[86:43.22]Now, there are a couple things we can try.
[86:44.94]We could look at some inkblots.
[86:46.44]We could try some free association.
[86:48.32]I could interpret your dreams for you.
[86:51.42]Uh, let's try inkblot.
[86:52.77]How do inkblots work?
[86:54.09]And can we make them ourselves?
[86:55.61]It's easy.
[86:56.49]I just show you some pictures and you tell me what you see.
[86:59.93]Your responses can reveal things like obsessions or obsessions.
[87:05.67]Let's get psychoanalyzed on stream.
[87:06.96]Take a look at this and tell me what you see.
[87:08.98]Uh, that's Goro from Mortal Kombat.
[87:14.56]About to do a fatality to me.
[87:16.44]It's a point of view.
[87:20.80]See?
[87:21.32]He's like fucking running at me.
[87:24.43]Okay.
[87:24.81]Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime.
[87:29.03]I don't see... A pair of oxen boxing in a rowboat.
[87:34.77]I don't see that either.
[87:36.03]Susan Lucci holding an Emmy.
[87:39.40]I don't see that either.
[87:40.22]The results of the last time I let Max drive.
[87:44.64]I mean, that could be like flat...
[87:51.95]Okay, without even looking... This is two old ladies.
[88:03.24]These are two old ladies with their hands up.
[88:05.30]So they see, like, the big bun hair, two cigarettes, two old ladies, back-to-back, about to do a duel with cameras.
[88:11.96]The selfie dueling.
[88:14.24]That's what I see first of all, first and foremost, before I look at anything.
[88:19.07]Okay, a bunch of bacteria playing basketball.
[88:20.93]I don't see that.
[88:22.19]Pigeons on at the marquee at a man's Chinese theater.
[88:27.95]No.
[88:28.39]An SUV crashing into an opulent mansion.
[88:32.04]No.
[88:33.00]The St.
[88:33.34]Valentine's Day.
[88:34.48]No, I don't see any.
[88:36.26]I see, like, a mustache.
[88:43.77]No, none of this is right.
[88:47.55]Pigeons on the Marquee?
[88:48.96]No.
[88:54.24]SUV... I would probably... Pigeons, I guess.
[89:06.14]Pigeons on the Marquee at Mann's Chinese Theater.
[89:10.00]And this?
[89:13.98]Alright, what do I see first of all without looking at it?
[89:16.77]This is... This looks like some type of Satan or something.
[89:21.65]See like the face, two eyes, nose.
[89:25.15]Just looming, hovering over what looks to be potentially... This is maybe a body.
[89:32.96]Like it's a goat head, goat Satan.
[89:35.02]Goat, it's just Satan.
[89:35.98]Because there's like the legs and like the arms and shit.
[89:39.94]Or it could be multiple entities at the same time.
[89:49.07]Or like a scorpion or something.
[89:58.31]A squirrel that got run over twice.
[90:00.63]Now this one.
[90:01.09]What do you see?
[90:04.38]Okay, this one, again, I see two.
[90:08.28]It's either, okay, it's either Oros from World of Warcraft, like the light things.
[90:16.51]Some of you will get that.
[90:17.39]Or there's another, it's the nose, the face, his hand coming out, like two dancing, like dueling dancing.
[90:28.21]Two, like, circus performers or back-to-back here doing selfie duels.
[90:40.10]the exhaust manifold of a bread truck.
[90:43.30]And this one?
[90:47.49]Uh, it's a Pokémon.
[90:49.89]This is when it goes like, doo-doo-doo!
[90:52.85]And it zooms in.
[90:57.25]And then it fades into color, and they go like, Woo-ja-do!
[91:04.38]That's the only thing I can see.
[91:07.67]There's been so many fucked up Pokemons, I guarantee if you superimpose a Pokémon that looks like this on... They're out of like the 16,000 Pokémon that exist now, one of these matches.
[91:24.61]Pokémon is The Simpsons of monster character creation.
[91:30.09]If you think you made up something, they already have done it.
[91:33.63]It's just that joke.
[91:35.93]Do you, oh, you have like an original monster animal thing that you've drawn?
[91:39.67]No, there's a Pokémon.
[91:40.65]There's already like 30,000 of them.
[91:41.99]Database has been made.
[91:42.79]A war between two teams of abstract shapes.
[91:52.16]You seem fairly focused on cars.
[91:55.16]But it's probably nothing to worry about.
[91:57.18]Any more?
[91:57.52]Thanks, Doc.
[92:01.54]Wait, what?
[92:01.80]Say a word.
[92:03.66]Okay.
[92:03.80]Vegas.
[92:36.10]Eucalyptus.
[92:37.24]Eucalyptus.
[92:38.20]Interesting.
[92:39.34]Now try this one.
[92:40.76]Crown.
[92:41.46]King.
[92:41.66]Just do or say whatever comes naturally.
[92:48.62]Frozen concentrated orange juice.
[92:50.98]I see.
[92:52.26]Comb.
[92:53.26]Hair.
[92:54.50]It's not so basic.
[92:57.66]A pomade.
[92:58.61]Promenade.
[92:59.57]I have a dream.
[93:00.11]Okay, I want to do...
[93:23.63]Does this exist?
[93:24.39]Can I take, like, a total, like, evaluation somewhere online?
[93:28.46]I want to do this whole thing in, like, three hours.
[93:29.80]Yeah, I want to stream it.
[93:47.76]Remember your dream.
[93:48.52]My dreams always start in the office.
[93:50.64]But this time, things were different.
[93:53.40]Mmm, yes, I can picture it.
[93:55.15]Tell me what happened.
[93:57.03]It's called BuzzFeed Quizzes.
[94:02.53]No, I'm talking about, like, a real.
[94:04.49]Like, this costs money, and I go get analyzed with a bunch of blots and ink tests and questions and that kind of fast responses, and we'll see what they do.
[94:16.18]Uh, this is me.
[94:17.64]It was me.
[94:18.88]You?
[94:19.24]Hmm.
[94:20.82]I think you represent yourself.
[94:24.02]I didn't even realize that was possible.
[94:26.16]Oh, sure.
[94:26.84]Any crazy thing's possible in psychoanalysis.
[94:30.12]Tell me, did the other you say or do anything unexpected?
[94:34.54]No, the usual.
[94:35.80]Hi, Sam.
[94:36.26]How are you?
[94:37.26]I'm fine, Sam.
[94:38.12]And yourself?
[94:39.16]Not too shabby.
[94:40.40]Fascinating.
[94:41.70]Where does your mind come up with this stuff?
[94:45.16]See, I told you about me and Sam.
[94:46.50]I get that.
[94:48.30]Vibe completely with this, because, you know, like, hair, comb.
[94:57.26]I didn't notice anything on... Then why do you mention it?
[95:00.53]I don't know.
[95:01.87]Interesting.
[95:03.35]I wanted the trash.
[95:05.95]Me, then trash, then... Uh... Bored?
[95:11.71]I noticed something bizarre in the closet.
[95:14.09]Yes, we put things in the closet we want to hide away, things we're ashamed of.
[95:18.38]Please, Sam, what's in your closet?
[95:21.36]A bunch of shit-stained underwear that I don't want anyone to see.
[95:26.32]A whole stack of lottery tickets.
[95:28.58]Interesting.
[95:29.50]Perhaps you feel you don't really earn your money.
[95:32.17]Don't worry, lady.
[95:33.13]We get paid to crack skulls, and by that measure, we ought to be millionaires.
[95:43.54]I noticed something bizarre in the closet.
[95:46.14]Ah, something you're ashamed of.
[95:47.80]What was it?
[95:50.96]No, that's fine.
[95:51.44]Lottery tickets.
[95:51.90]A whole stack of lottery tickets.
[95:54.35]Don't worry, lady.
[95:55.17]Alright, what else?
[95:59.05]I tell you, sometimes I forget that I'm just, like, live, that I just... that I'm streaming.
[96:06.42]I remembered that I'd just gotten something from the bakery.
[96:09.69]Oh, sounds like you and your special guest there were having a little celebration.
[96:13.49]What did you get?
[96:14.25]I was thinking about them.
[96:16.53]I got a birthday cake, a wedding cake, a fruit cake, a cheesecake.
[96:19.65]Cheesecake.
[96:23.80]It was a cheesecake.
[96:25.26]And I mean literally a piece of cheese in a cake.
[96:28.32]What does that represent?
[96:29.66]No, that doesn't mean anything.
[96:30.94]It's just random nonsense.
[96:32.60]That's good.
[96:36.92]One cheesecake for every death in Sekiro.
[96:39.68]Sounds good, Sam.
[96:44.32]What else is here?
[96:44.90]Out the window?
[96:46.14]Yes.
[96:47.00]Let's examine my obsessions with inkblots.
[96:49.09]Let's examine my... Okay, hold on.
[97:05.29]Wait, didn't I already do this?
[97:06.01]Oh, and more ink blots?
[97:07.03]Oh, we already did it.
[97:08.73]Never mind.
[97:09.17]Oh, shit.
[97:09.55]How do I get out of here?
[97:11.75]And this?
[97:11.99]Now this one.
[97:13.59]And this one.
[97:42.18]I got them all.
[97:46.08]Let's go.
[97:46.84]Okay.
[97:50.26]So now.
[97:56.51]We can get out of here.
[97:57.53]Probably.
[97:59.61]That's it for the three.
[98:02.15]That's the wrong way.
[98:03.19]He's instinctively going over there.
[98:04.93]His dream.
[98:05.27]Remember the lottery tickets?
[98:06.15]You guys have fucking analyzed.
[98:09.05]Stop analyzing me.
[98:12.19]Get out of here.
[98:13.23]Get out of my head.
[98:18.40]Okay.
[98:21.92]So now, back to the office?
[98:36.91]He thinks he's streaming right now.
[98:38.63]Interesting.
[98:41.95]Hmm, they're very weird.
[98:43.49]Hmm.
[98:45.04]He's talking out loud while lying down on his back.
[98:50.36]In the bed.
[98:53.50]Is he still hypnotized?
[98:54.26]Uh, anything on TV?
[99:04.78]I don't really believe...
[99:07.15]On this week's edition of Oh, Is He Still Alive?, we look at the stars of the 1970s television hit The Soda Poppers.
[99:15.29]I love shows that destroy all our cherished delusions about the stars we once loved.
[99:19.85]He's dead.
[99:21.61]During The Soda Poppers' heyday, Young Specs was the role model for obsessive neat freaks all over the globe.
[99:27.89]Ticker-tape-free ticker-tape parades were thrown in honor of The Soda Popper, who never missed a spot.
[99:33.59]Backstage, though, things were quite a bit dirtier.
[99:36.90]Speck's obsession with perfection caused massive delays in shooting and infuriated coworkers.
[99:42.38]He famously demanded over 11,000 retakes of the line, You Made Me Mess Up, made all the more annoying because of his tendency to repeat the line immediately after reading it.
[99:53.21]Following the show, Specs was rarely seen in public, although he did make one ill-fated venture into celebrity tag team mud wrestling, getting pinned in a record three seconds as he desperately tried to wipe down the ring with a dishrag.
[100:06.54]The meltdown utterly enraged his tag team partner and good friend, the Dog from My Mother the Dog, who stormed out of the arena without a word.
[100:15.04]They haven't spoken since.
[100:16.72]Coming up next, the Soda Popper who couldn't always keep it in.
[100:24.00]Well, that was okay.
[100:27.02]Mother of the Dog for Jerma Rumble.
[100:31.04]Hey, settle down, alright?
[100:32.76]Not everybody has to join.
[100:43.27]Settle down, alright?
[100:44.23]Let's waste precious time driving around aimlessly.
[100:53.77]Got a pretty... Sam and Max tag team, though.
[100:58.19]That seems really possible, doesn't it?
[101:01.17]If it's good enough.
[101:01.91]If I like it.
[101:02.77]Alright, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[101:16.54]Do I drive to a new area?
[101:25.36]Is this the only three locations I can do right now?
[102:01.71]Where did the popper go?
[102:19.25]Where's the popper?
[102:22.24]What is this one?
[102:24.64]Take control of your mind.
[102:25.84]Is it working?
[102:27.32]I don't know.
[102:28.38]Destroy the intruder in your dreams.
[102:30.87]Alright, let's go wake up Whizzer.
[102:56.44]What am I doing?
[103:27.34]Oh, sorry.
[103:27.68]I was doing Donald Duck.
[103:28.65]I was trying to for a second.
[103:29.71]Take control of your mind.
[103:31.45]Destroy the intruder in your dreams.
[103:33.01]It's not going to happen, though.
[103:33.85]Nicely done, Sam.
[103:34.95]You're a natural.
[103:37.19]Where am I?
[103:39.19]Who are you?
[103:40.59]Don't worry.
[103:41.08]We're freelance police.
[103:42.48]Police?
[103:43.44]Oh, no!
[103:45.58]Hey!
[103:48.18]He's getting away in that truck!
[103:50.60]Quick, follow that Soda Popper.
[103:54.35]Oh, okay.
[103:55.59]Driving sequence.
[103:58.57]Is he dropping trash?
[104:04.07]It's actually kind of hard to tune with the mouse.
[104:31.19]Come here!
[104:37.20]Take the wheel!
[105:01.57]Got it.
[105:02.81]Yes!
[105:13.68]Don't shoot!
[105:14.92]Aside from the fact that we just plugged your truck, why would you think we'd shoot you?
[105:18.81]Except for the obvious sport value, of course.
[105:21.23]It's just, you always see cops on the news beating up some guy just because he's a former child star.
[105:27.61]We would never dream of hurting former child stars.
[105:30.61]We just need to find the home where Brady Culture keeps them.
[105:33.62]Oh, why didn't you say so?
[105:35.56]It's right over there, across the street.
[105:38.52]Jumping elephant fleas.
[105:40.40]How devilishly convenient.
[105:42.32]Thanks.
[105:46.10]Um, does anyone know where I can find a bathroom?
[105:52.97]Here we go.
[105:55.77]Brady Culture's home for former child stars.
[106:02.21]Hmm.
[106:05.04]Where to go first?
[106:06.40]Mole Man.
[106:06.80]Looks like a shifty character to me.
[106:08.86]Don't they all?
[106:11.42]I think someone was sitting here.
[106:13.40]And leaking.
[106:17.32]Okay, one minute.
[106:17.96]Other door, admission forms.
[106:19.22]I went to the dentist today.
[106:21.06]I went to the dentist today.
[106:48.22]Teeth are fucking clean.
[106:49.92]They're beautiful.
[106:50.82]They're perfect.
[106:52.81]I have two cavities I have to get a root canal.
[106:54.69]And I have to change out one of my teeth.
[106:58.11]One of them is completely broken and rotten in the back.
[107:00.71]So, I mean... Hmm.
[107:05.51]It's order.
[107:06.23]Apparently... Disturbing little monkey.
[107:14.56]No, my teeth are fine.
[107:15.54]I had one once.
[107:16.76]You're a monkey?
[107:17.96]Essentially.
[107:21.04]I guess this is where you stick your admission form.
[107:23.10]We need an admission form.
[107:24.55]So can I take an admission form?
[107:27.71]Symptoms form.
[107:34.51]It didn't like it.
[107:35.55]I bet we have to get that officially filled out.
[107:37.93]Trust me.
[107:39.15]Okay.
[107:39.61]So we gotta bring this form back to Sybil.
[107:44.70]Home for former Gerber Rumble stars.
[107:46.98]Alright, we got the form.
[107:50.58]Let's bring it back to Sybil.
[107:51.82]Just click on everything.
[107:54.14]We got the form.
[107:55.00]Let's go ahead and add inflection.
[107:58.63]At the end of every sentence.
[107:59.73]Let's get in the car.
[108:05.67]That'll bring us to where we are now.
[108:18.25]Sybil's office?
[108:22.66]Is it time for a pee break?
[108:23.76]Not yet.
[108:24.88]It will be very soon, though.
[108:26.18]I've got news for you.
[108:31.62]Somebody said shut the fuck up.
[108:35.25]You're gonna be in big trouble if you keep that up.
[108:37.77]Big trouble.
[108:44.07]Big trouble.
[108:48.07]Do you think I might have artificial personality disorder?
[108:51.15]Hmm, interesting.
[108:53.55]Symptoms include, let's see, obsession with money, violent reactions to dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's peers getting older.
[109:02.27]Hey, I know.
[109:02.95]I could psychoanalyze you.
[109:04.95]You already did.
[109:06.19]No, I already did this.
[109:09.07]This took like 25 minutes.
[109:11.11]Do it.
[109:11.63]Let's save the psychoanalysis.
[109:14.15]Oh, goddammit.
[109:17.04]Symptoms include obsession with money, violent reactions to dentistry, and an unconscious desire to see one's... Okay, so we have to see.
[109:24.46]Hey, doc.
[109:25.36]Hey.
[109:29.18]How'd you like to shrink my head a little?
[109:30.92]Of course.
[109:31.92]What?
[109:33.10]Okay, ink blots.
[109:33.84]Can we do some more ink?
[109:35.14]Sure.
[109:35.56]Take a look.
[109:37.00]Okay, so what was the first thing?
[109:38.00]It was reactions to money.
[109:40.34]Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime.
[109:43.34]Pennies on the eyes of a dead mime.

[110:53.69]Debit card.
[110:54.77]A debit card fed through a document shredder.
[110:57.53]Well, judging by your responses, you seem to be fairly obsessed with money.
[111:01.05]That's a symptom of artificial personality disorder.
[111:04.07]I'd better mark it on your chart.
[111:05.83]Jerma's obsessed with money.
[111:08.95]Very interesting.
[111:10.93]We should test you for the other symptoms of APD.

[111:17.80]I'm a psychotherapist.

[114:20.35]I was trying to click on Max.
[114:22.15]Am I sane?
[114:22.99]Do you think I might?
[114:24.53]Maybe.
[114:26.96]Let's try some more free association.
[114:29.08]A major clusterfuck this game.
[114:32.82]A punch.
[114:34.64]Of money.
[114:36.38]Great job.
[114:37.28]You just scared the money out of my wallet.
[114:39.50]Have a good night.
[114:44.37]Thank you for the... Thank you so much for the money.
[114:48.61]Major clusterfuck.
[114:49.53]Actually, that's a fucking lot of money.
[114:50.55]Seriously.
[114:51.01]Thank you.
[114:55.12]Have a good night as well.
[114:57.00]Major clusterfuck.
[114:58.20]Fluoride.
[114:58.76]Fluoride.
[114:59.08]Travesty.
[114:59.26]Fluoride.
[114:59.78]Fluoride.
[115:00.16]Travesty.
[115:00.38]Teasing.
[115:24.44]Aquamarine interest.
[115:26.08]Well, this has been, am I the, do you think I might maybe, no, let's try that.
[115:32.68]We'll tell you.
[115:33.68]Remember I'll ready, ready, ready as a roof.
[115:35.96]Interesting choice of word.
[115:40.10]Let's go.
[115:40.48]Okay.
[115:43.34]Let's try.
[115:44.64]I see.
[115:45.92]Polish, Polish.
[115:54.23]Whoa, don't shoot.
[115:55.31]Violent reaction.
[115:56.19]Violent reaction.
[115:57.65]You should see him at Thanksgiving.
[115:58.97]Hmm.
[116:00.34]Violent reaction to the word.
[116:02.30]Very interesting.
[116:05.16]Polish.
[116:06.22]Just do or say whatever comes naturally.
[116:13.89]Sample size.
[116:15.63]Sample size.
[116:17.57]Alright.
[116:18.91]Yes?
[116:19.65]Your responses lead me to believe that you have... It could be symptomatic of artificial personality disorder.
[116:28.14]I'd better mark this on your chart.
[116:31.04]What is it, Doc?
[116:32.32]Sample size.
[116:33.54]You have two of the symptoms listed on this form.
[116:36.42]Am I deranged?
[116:37.72]I don't want to alarm you, but probably.
[116:40.28]Uh-oh.
[116:40.90]Can I have your hat when they commit you?
[116:42.84]Sure, little buddy.
[116:46.02]I'd like to tell you about another mundane but strangely compelling dream I had.
[116:50.18]Alright, let's examine your disturbing subconscious desires a bit further.
[116:57.05]Okay, tell me what happened.
[117:00.41]You're scared of other people getting older.
[117:07.70]I realized there was someone else in the room with me.
[117:10.90]Oh, who was your special guest?
[117:14.93]So it's not me.
[117:15.65]Who would it be?
[117:20.41]Other people?
[117:21.14]It would be Max, right?
[117:27.18]It was Max.
[117:28.76]Ah, yes, your imaginary friend.
[117:30.58]Not you getting older, other people.
[117:31.66]Excuse me, I'm standing right next to you, lady.
[117:34.19]In your dream, was Max doing anything unusual?
[117:37.93]Well, he was saying the Pledge of Allegiance to the tune of Camptown Races.
[117:41.94]I pledge allegiance to my gun, doodah, doodah.
[117:45.64]But that's not unusual.
[117:47.92]Okay.
[117:49.80]What was Max doing?
[117:52.31]What was Max doing?
[117:56.59]I had just gotten something new from the bakery.
[117:59.39]For a celebration, perhaps?
[118:01.23]What did you get?
[118:01.83]A birthday cake.
[118:08.13]they're getting older it was an overly frosted birthday cake wait a second the birthday cake your friend you subconsciously want to see your peers get older I could have told you that this is a definite symptom of artificial personality disorder yes I mean I hope it's not serious I'd better mark this on your chart
[118:32.17]Mark it on your chart.
[118:33.01]Boston.
[118:34.17]I've been doing the Boston thing a lot lately, haven't I?
[118:37.01]I would do that more frequently.
[119:03.54]God, that's the wrong door.
[119:06.05]It's just so close.
[119:06.87]Alright, so I got it.
[119:08.85]Symptoms form.
[119:11.09]Let's go turn it in.
[119:20.63]Where we going, Sam?
[119:36.40]back to Brady Coulter's home for former child stars.
[119:39.54]Oh, okay.
[119:58.96]Put it in.
[120:07.25]You've been accepted.
[120:14.41]Come on, little buddy.
[120:15.39]There's justice to be served.
[120:17.24]Can we get ice cream afterwards?
[120:18.98]Justice makes me hungry.
[120:25.38]This reminds me of that place where Aunt Judy lives with the medicine smell and the rubber sheets and the enormous mute Indian.
[120:31.68]Sounds like a million laughs.
[120:33.14]Yeah, mostly after medication time.
[120:35.28]Where is everybody?
[120:38.96]There he is.
[120:41.62]Uh-oh.
[120:42.44]Pulchritude above doubts.
[120:45.00]This is Culture's clubhouse.
[120:47.45]Jumping Lon Chaney in a Bothell Frightwig.
[120:50.91]Brady Culture, I presume.
[120:53.51]You know who I am?
[120:55.25]Wow.
[120:56.17]Evil plans really do work.
[120:58.27]Don't get too excited, Stretchpants.
[121:00.19]The freelance police are here.
[121:02.21]Yes, actually.
[121:03.51]I've been waiting for you.
[121:07.77]Really?
[121:08.67]Next time, try leaving the front door open.
[121:10.91]Save us all some grief.
[121:13.22]Allow me to explain.
[121:15.12]Uh-oh.
[121:17.75]I think we just triggered a soliloquy.
[121:19.68]Good thing I have the attention span of a pint of yak butter.
[121:22.72]I never wanted much.
[121:25.14]Just to be universally loved, that's all.
[121:28.40]And to be number one in the TV ratings for the 1971 fall season.
[121:32.80]But no, those worthless hacks, the soda puppies, with their matching shirts and their cute little jingles, they came on opposite me and stole my audience.
[121:45.19]It's an organ.
[121:45.55]Just mash your face against it.
[121:46.55]It'll sound good.
[121:48.01]You know what?
[121:48.63]That's true.
[121:49.01]Some of the best organ songs are just mashing.
[122:12.09]I'm afraid you'll just have to take their places.
[122:16.00]In your dreams, culture!
[122:17.80]No, my friends.
[122:20.20]In yours.
[122:23.22]Hey, that tickles!
[122:24.50]Become... Video Delivery Man.
[122:37.99]What?
[122:39.21]What's happening?
[122:40.29]Oh, no!
[122:41.07]Oh, no!
[122:42.65]What are you doing?
[122:44.91]I don't know.
[122:45.53]I... You were in on it all along.
[122:48.57]I told you it was a conspiracy.
[122:50.38]I told you, but then you already knew, didn't you?
[122:54.06]No, Bosco.
[122:54.84]I must deliver videos.
[122:57.86]Call the CIA!
[122:58.92]Call Interpol!
[122:59.98]Call Mickey Rooney!
[123:01.70]Must deliver Mickey Rooney videos.
[123:04.42]Mickey Rooney?
[123:08.12]So we have to deliver the videos?
[123:10.42]Where's Max?
[123:16.47]I must deliver videos.
[123:22.19]Hey, my beloved weapons are gone.
[123:28.95]I must deliver videos.
[123:31.19]You mean the cheese?
[123:32.35]Too far.
[123:33.33]Too far.
[123:36.89]I tried to get the cheese.
[123:39.26]Alright, give me the cheese.
[123:40.44]Oh, don't even try it!
[123:45.64]I love that part.
[123:46.68]Now somebody come in and tell me that everything's... Hey, just tell me.
[123:49.20]Talk to me.
[123:50.94]Do the spell.
[123:51.66]The reverse spell.
[123:52.36]Uh-oh.
[123:58.92]Either I just walked into the Salvador Dali Memorial Wax Museum, or I'm dreaming.
[124:04.45]You love me.
[124:05.69]You adore me.
[124:07.11]Become Video Delivery Man.
[124:11.75]Do my evil bidding and so forth.
[124:16.19]Holy brains in a blender.
[124:17.59]I'm still hypnotized.
[124:19.09]If only I could remember what Sybil told me to do.
[124:22.37]Destroy the intruder in your dream.
[124:27.03]Oh, yeah.
[124:28.14]Hey, Sam, I'm up here.
[124:29.94]Oh, hi, little buddy.
[124:30.96]So I got to put everybody back together again?
[124:32.20]You stole my body.
[124:33.22]I hate when people do that.
[124:34.66]You got to get me down from here.
[124:36.64]Okay, little guy, I'll save you.
[124:38.04]Alright, so first things first.
[124:43.65]Let's take your head off.
[124:46.69]Oh, and it feels good, too.
[124:49.83]I just love my new furry paws and cute little tail.
[124:53.64]Hey, don't touch my tail, you psychopathic body stealer.
[124:56.58]Ooh, just let me at him.
[124:58.12]Alright, do I have any items?
[125:01.54]I could, gun.
[125:07.61]It's Brady Culture on TV.
[125:09.81]Yes, right where I belong.
[125:12.57]Everyone watch me.
[125:14.69]Me!
[125:25.37]Shooting TV stars only makes them stronger.
[125:28.55]Is that?
[125:30.57]I don't know, but I don't know if I believe that.
[125:34.65]Didn't hurt.
[125:41.79]I don't want to pop him.
[125:47.79]Smoke.
[125:49.43]Alright, I didn't even know this was over here.
[125:50.89]Hold on.
[125:51.21]It's just a dream, Sam.
[125:52.95]Bicycle pump and the rat.
[125:55.71]Is it Bicycle Puppet?
[125:59.84]Oh, now we get a giant rat.
[126:01.00]Uh, oh.
[126:01.22]Interesting.
[126:03.54]What about the closet?
[126:04.00]He's in the closet too with the cheese.
[126:20.54]I will be number one in the ratings now.
[126:23.38]Hey, Brady Cheese.
[126:24.68]What is it, fool?
[126:26.32]I'd like to introduce you to a little friend of mine.
[126:28.77]Make him big so he gets in there and eats him.
[126:31.85]Only has like a couple seconds to do it though.
[126:33.85]No, the cheese must stand alone.
[126:40.37]And another one bites the cheese.
[126:41.82]Alright, so what did that do?
[126:48.54]Is it empty?
[126:51.35]Alright.
[126:54.24]The smoke probably does something.
[126:59.82]I will be universally strange.
[127:02.02]What does he say about... I didn't click on that.
[127:10.18]Don't worry little buddy.
[127:11.06]I'll get you.
[127:11.99]Hurry Sam!
[127:12.79]I've got an itch I can't scratch!
[127:17.91]Gun's not gonna do anything.
[127:18.95]What about the window?
[127:21.16]TV.
[127:21.90]Can't shoot the TV.
[127:26.70]Bicycle pump.
[127:27.82]Enigmatic.
[127:29.53]What's he pointing at?
[127:38.85]Why is he pointing at me?
[127:54.59]He's just following me around.
[127:55.47]You want to name every single one of them?
[127:57.95]God.
[128:11.24]He's not doing it now.
[128:13.16]Dance, Puppet, dance.
[128:17.38]Turn the lights off?
[128:17.82]I think someone needs to turn the lights out on your career, Brady.
[128:21.32]What?
[128:21.78]No!
[128:24.42]Oh, that Brady culture.
[128:25.72]He turns the world off with his smile.
[128:27.64]A coat rack is a pencil.
[128:32.28]Interesting.
[128:32.88]Can I pick it up?
[128:34.04]It's just a dream, Sam.
[128:37.58]I cannot pick it up.
[128:38.90]So how do I get your head off of that body?
[128:45.41]What is this doing here?
[128:46.85]Hey, it's loose.
[128:49.01]Down?
[128:51.10]Whoa.
[128:51.72]Oh, OK.
[128:53.20]That was the most fun I've had since I lost my body.
[128:55.72]Oh, I got to get his head.
[128:56.36]Let's do it again, Sam.
[128:57.16]I got to get his head off.
[128:57.74]What now?
[128:58.26]Yay!
[128:58.72]I got to move him over here or get his head off.
[129:00.28]That was great.
[129:00.96]But Sam, if you'll know.
[129:02.01]OK, hold on.
[129:02.69]Alright, how do I get?
[129:04.83]Can I push you over?
[129:06.01]Brady's stolen Max's.
[129:07.77]Just let me at him.
[129:14.05]How do I get?
[129:14.69]How do I move you this way?
[129:20.66]I may not show it much, but I love you, Sam.
[129:24.11]Now go wash my car.
[129:29.64]Should I break this open?
[129:30.98]Weird.
[129:32.02]I may not.
[129:45.98]Can I turn it the other way?
[129:47.75]Does it have to go down?
[129:48.95]Can I move it to the other side?
[129:50.37]So it goes left or right?
[130:00.45]Okay, hold on.
[130:10.80]whoa gotcha yay oh alright I thought I could how do I get your head off can I just tear it off with my bare hands I don't think max would like me sticking his head there no no not like not like shove your head down his your pants I'm talking like here oh Mr. culture I have a surprise for you really for me

[130:41.70]Oh my.
[130:42.66]I did it.
[130:43.38]Do I need to release them?
[130:46.58]Wash my car.
[131:10.52]How do I get the TV off?
[131:14.40]I can't shoot the TV now.
[131:15.54]Can I shoot the TV now that his brain is gone?
[131:18.02]I think I've done... The smoke is the only thing that's interactable, I think, still.
[131:37.11]The hand.
[131:37.65]I will strange.
[131:42.39]Is there a plug?
[131:42.95]I wonder what would happen to the picture quality if I gave this a tug.
[131:48.79]This is essentially pulling the plug.
[131:50.21]I must be on TV for all eternity.
[131:52.41]No!
[131:56.25]Oh, yes.
[131:56.73]That's much better reception.
[132:02.08]You got it.
[132:03.48]Oh, no.
[132:04.24]He's awake.
[132:05.02]We're done for.
[132:05.94]Save the girlish histrionics, Bosco.
[132:08.00]I'm alright.
[132:09.00]Hmm.
[132:09.94]Hermitini finally has a use.
[132:10.86]Why is Sam Robin from the 60s Batman?
[132:12.12]Lightning Rider just gave five community subs.
[132:13.94]Thank you for the five subs.
[132:40.32]Coming in with five.
[132:42.30]Thank you.
[132:45.00]Brady Culture?
[132:46.40]Ibo-Man?
[132:47.33]Stay away from him.
[132:48.27]He's got it in for me.
[132:49.79]Sorry, Bosco.
[132:50.51]No can do.
[132:51.51]I've got to save my furry little pal.
[132:55.35]Can you help me?
[132:56.03]I don't suppose you have a Bosco tech device that stymies hypnosis-inducing energy beams.
[133:00.72]A hypnosis blocker?
[133:02.34]I thought about making one of those, but I wouldn't even know where to begin.
[133:05.92]I've got to find something quick.
[133:16.23]No, don't take the cheese.
[133:21.15]Can I just go walk back in the front door?
[133:29.39]Do I have a... No, my car is gone, right?
[133:32.68]Technically.
[133:37.18]I guess I drove back.
[133:40.95]How did I drive the car back?
[133:42.76]I'm not going back to that asylum until I've got a working defense against that dastardly hypnotist.
[133:47.90]Okay, I need a... What about over here?
[133:49.52]Maybe Sybil will give me something.
[133:55.69]Speaking of community subs, Ert.
[133:57.45]Thank you, Ert, for the five community subs.
[134:00.57]Ert.
[134:02.47]110.
[134:02.53]Thank you.
[134:07.82]Doc.
[134:10.46]max is gone well most of us outgrow our imaginary friends eventually no that megalomaniac brady culture's got him I see of course how do you get picked for a community sub I think it's just random it randomly just picks a non-sub in the chat and they get it hang on were you implying that max is imaginary
[134:35.53]I wasn't implying anything, though he does seem a little improbable.
[134:40.28]Singularly.
[134:41.88]True, but then I'm a psychotherapist.
[134:46.16]I've got to find some way to block a hypnotic ray.
[134:49.54]I don't suppose you, as a brain specialist of sorts, would know anything.
[134:52.90]I've been monitoring people for months to choose who to pick.
[134:56.50]Great suffering labyrinth.
[134:58.04]You do know something.
[134:59.68]Out with it.
[135:00.24]Before my synapses fuse into a milky puddle of swag.
[135:03.86]Well, it's a gross breach of doctor-patient privilege for me to even tell you about it.
[135:09.25]But one of my more technologically inclined patients drew me a diagram of a contraption he claimed will block hypnosis.
[135:17.12]That's just the sort of ridiculously lucky break I need.
[135:20.06]Make a device note.
[135:21.40]Engineering.
[135:44.82]Okay.
[135:46.26]Hey, PilotGuy.
[135:47.70]Five more community subs from PilotGuy.
[135:49.72]Five more community subs from GermanLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[135:56.36]Terosophilia, five community subs.
[135:59.00]And here comes the rollout of gifted subs.
[136:02.65]Thank you, guys.
[136:06.15]I'm gonna go give this to Bosco.
[136:07.73]It's not that way.
[136:11.92]Oh, Jesus.
[136:13.76]Fa... I can't... They're coming out too fast.
[136:17.91]Gnarly thanks to the five community subs.
[136:20.37]PikaBanana, five.
[136:21.95]PixelMike, five.
[136:22.99]Drosophilia, five.
[136:23.99]It's a lot, thank you guys.
[136:40.90]What a generous bunch of people.
[136:52.95]Even more coming in.
[136:55.63]Flugboy.
[136:56.51]Gnarly.
[136:58.60]Did Gnarly give another five?
[136:59.70]Flugboy with five.
[137:04.94]Who now isn't a sub?
[137:08.52]Everybody's a sub at this point.

[148:20.02]I tried to send you semaphore signals with my ears, but you know how I always get the K and the V mixed up?
[148:25.14]You crack me up, little buddy.

[148:53.26]It's great to be on your show, Myra.
[148:54.84]I'm a huge fan.
[148:56.20]I just can't seem to stop watching for some reason.

[149:57.81]We'll bring it back, we'll do episode two.
[150:01.23]They're all like two, two and a half hours, so that's a good time.
[150:16.08]So we're gonna do season one, episode two.
[150:21.97]That drunk guy at Pate cannot killing us.
[150:25.93]What?
[150:28.56]Who was that?
[150:28.94]Was that somebody in the credits?
[150:31.55]That was somebody's job description?
[150:42.73]Oh, special thanks, I see.
[150:49.69]Well, uh, that's episode one.
[150:51.91]I'm gonna save it.
[150:52.38]Oh.
[150:55.08]Well, I already beat it, so it don't matter.
[150:58.64]Episode 2 is its own separate game.
[151:00.68]So we're gonna open it.
[151:02.86]I'll be right back.
[151:04.26]Gonna grab a water.
[151:06.06]Gonna pee.

[155:59.06]But I also wanna make this clear, make sure everyone knows it's existing, that after today, you are not gonna see me for a week, I'm out.
[156:16.08]I'm out of here.
[156:18.88]I will be back around this time next weekend.
[156:25.54]I'm going on a mom vacation.
[156:29.80]I will not be around.
[156:32.18]Just make sure everybody knows.
[156:39.34]Talked about it a bunch, but I want to make sure nobody misses it.
[156:43.66]It's going to be the title of my stream for a week.
[156:47.48]It's going to be, Mom is here.
[156:49.78]See you next week.
[156:54.17]Jerma's average dong comes in with 10 community subs.
[157:03.35]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[157:04.87]Jerma's average dong.
[157:07.37]I'm going to mute this because it's probably going to be pretty loud.
[157:10.61]What's episode 2 called?
[157:15.65]Situation Comedy is Episode 2.
[157:20.17]Interesting.
[157:23.80]Are they all, like, two, two and a half hours long?
[157:28.78]Or is it one of those scenarios where... Because it seems like each one is its own game.
[157:32.58]Okay.
[157:36.23]Okay.
[157:45.15]Five more community subs from Frodeon Weapon.
[157:48.63]Thank you, Frodeon.
[157:52.17]Thank you, all of you.
[157:55.01]Listen how loud this is.
[157:58.67]You can hear that shit.
[157:59.65]This is the gym playlist.
[158:09.06]I had to take them out.
[158:10.88]Headphones are out.
[158:15.15]More community subs from Jerma's average dunk.
[158:20.47]Oh my god.
[158:21.69]Thank you.

[158:30.30]I gotta get to the menu.
[158:36.36]More community subs.
[158:37.48]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[158:38.90]Five more community subs.
[158:44.77]You guys look- Somebody get that phone!
[158:48.82]Oh wow, a 15 sub dong.
[158:50.86]Okay, here we go.
[158:52.92]I'm gonna have to restart it.
[158:58.42]The resolution's all wrong.
[158:59.71]It's all wrong.
[159:02.05]Alright, that's better.
[159:07.65]Uh, gotta turn full screen off, because I cannot capture it, otherwise it'll lag.
[159:14.21]Apply the resolution.
[159:16.83]And let's cap the screen.
[159:20.05]What do you say?
[159:20.55]Let's get this over with, huh?
[159:24.99]Hey, there we are.
[159:31.50]Okay, new game.
[159:33.84]Yes, I do want to make a new game.
[159:42.07]Alright.
[159:43.13]Let's do episode 2.
[159:53.18]This is cool, though.
[159:57.30]It's fun just to sit and play and hang out.
[160:03.70]I said this yesterday, but it's kind of been a while since we've just relaxed and played a game together.
[160:10.37]Just watched and hung out.
[160:12.53]Talked about stuff.
[160:15.93]It's good to do.
[160:16.77]We did it yesterday.
[160:20.34]10 more community subs from my average dung.
[160:23.18]Jerma's average dung.
[160:24.06]That's... 10, 20, 30 plus community subs.
[160:28.74]Thank you so much.
[160:29.28]We got a duel to start this one.
[160:41.63]I remember that gun.
[160:43.63]That thing was worth a lot of money too.
[160:49.92]Yes.
[160:50.73]That's the, what's it called?
[160:51.83]The Lugamore, right?
[160:52.91]Sweet mother of double Jeopardy packs, stroking and butterscotch.
[160:56.39]We're on our way.
[160:59.52]Who was it?
[161:00.18]The Girl Scouts lawyers again?
[161:02.14]That was the commissioner.
[161:03.58]You will never guess which unduly famous TV personality made the most wanted criminals list this week.
[161:08.81]Phyllis Diller?
[161:09.57]Gavin McCloud?
[161:10.65]Wink Martindale?
[161:11.69]Close.
[161:12.63]Myra Stump.
[161:13.73]The darling hawk of daytime talk.
[161:15.51]Isn't that a hypnosis thing?
[161:16.67]As in America's mom?
[161:17.93]The woman who told Tom Hanks to get a haircut?
[161:20.64]Surely you jest.
[161:22.00]She's holding her audience hostage and giving them valuable gifts against their collective will.
[161:26.96]I don't normally endorse the use of the word dastardly, but this is clearly dastardly!
[161:31.91]Pre-refined for Lugermore.
[161:32.95]I think we've got to drive over to the station right away.
[161:35.23]We're at our earliest convenience.
[161:36.77]Great!
[161:37.67]I've been itching to bust some skulls since they cancelled my so-called life.
[161:42.65]The voice actor changed?
[161:46.16]Why?
[161:48.36]The other voice actor did episode one?
[161:50.76]And that's it?
[161:53.76]More dong!
[161:55.35]More, 10 more dongs.
[161:58.45]Thank you so much for the 10 community subs.
[162:00.73]10- Not so average anymore.
[162:04.27]Not such an average dong.
[162:09.79]Local streamer gets rich off own genitals.
[162:15.34]But yeah, if you're taking off, I know it's late.
[162:17.46]I started really late.
[162:18.16]I told you on Twitter that we've gotten another case so close on the heels of the last one.
[162:22.13]But we're gonna go for a little longer.
[162:25.53]We'll do episode 2, we'll chill.
[162:29.06]We'll probably go pretty late.
[162:33.72]So if it's, uh, I know I started at like 7 o'clock.
[162:36.66]Pacific.
[162:38.66]But I did want to go live today because I knew it wasn't gonna be live for a while.
[162:41.21]So if you're gonna take off, see you soon.
[162:42.45]See you next week.
[162:44.09]The sauce will be set to the day.
[162:45.55]And me and my mother will have a good time.
[162:49.59]But for people that are sticking around, we'll go, I'm assuming, past midnight tonight.
[162:56.61]Pacific.
[162:57.75]At least.
[163:01.51]Sam and Max 2.
[163:02.49]Here we go.
[163:04.19]Well, well.
[163:05.03]Iris Stump holding her audience hostage.
[163:07.61]You watch that particular bit of daytime fluff occasionally, don't you, Max?
[163:11.45]Whenever our TV's out of hot.
[163:13.11]For some reason, I can't get enough of her sharp-toothed maternal ranting.
[163:18.74]Holy shit, Jerma's average dong.
[163:21.99]Jerma average dong is trying to reach Jerma's massive dong status.
[163:28.63]More community subs.
[163:30.07]Thank you for ten more.
[163:32.97]Oh my god.
[163:33.23]Well, there's that.
[163:44.27]I am the massive dong.
[163:46.03]Oh god, they're the same person.
[163:54.79]This is all secret plot for me to talk about my dong.
[163:58.91]It's incredibly generous though, it really is.
[164:19.24]They're all the same person.
[164:20.42]It leads back to me.
[164:21.90]No.
[164:24.94]Seriously, whoever you are, thank you.
[164:26.20]It's a lot of money.
[164:28.30]Alright, so is it the same town?
[164:31.88]Same people?
[164:32.46]Same things?
[164:34.33]Just new adversary?
[164:36.59]What's this?
[164:36.85]Is it cheese in the closet still?
[164:38.81]Nope.
[164:40.91]Oh, it's the hair.
[164:41.73]Okay.
[164:41.97]Here's the hair.
[164:43.35]It makes for an unwieldy but oh-so-enchanting memento of our first case in a long while.
[164:48.99]He howled like a sick wallaby when I shaved it off him.
[164:52.15]Quick times.
[164:55.05]It's the hair.
[165:02.60]More.
[165:03.72]More subs.
[165:06.22]The dong money laundering scheme continues.
[165:09.42]Ten more.
[165:11.99]90 subs already.
[165:15.33]Oh my god.
[165:25.89]Let's go.

[165:31.01]Newspaper.
[165:31.47]Newspaper.
[165:32.87]He finally found a way to become famous.
[165:36.49]The police blotter.
[165:40.71]How do you report dick money to the IRS?
[165:46.55]Oh my god.
[165:46.87]Bringing Jerma up to a higher tax bracket.
[166:06.74]Samuel?
[166:07.66]Maximilian?
[166:09.14]And don't forget about Adventure Dan with five more community subs.
[166:12.86]Thank you.
[166:13.62]Not really.
[166:15.44]It's me, Bosco.
[166:18.79]What's with the slanted shirt strainer, Bosco?
[166:21.43]Bosco?
[166:23.15]I know not that moniker.
[166:25.45]I am Lord Reginald Rumpelbottom, Earl of Dukedom, with her.
[166:31.10]Sam, what language is he speaking?
[166:33.54]I'm not sure, Max, but I think it might be English.
[166:38.27]Local streamer writes off penis on tax form as a dependent.
[166:47.57]Imagine trying to pull some... I mean, what would you... Okay, if you were at the IRS and you saw that,
[166:58.84]What would you do?
[166:59.82]Would you laugh or would you be, like, annoyed?
[167:01.56]I'm not sure.
[167:02.64]Oh, they'll never find me now.
[167:09.51]Clever clogs.
[167:27.40]Alright, so what's the problem?
[167:28.58]Six forces of evil are bedeviling you this time.
[167:31.09]It's the skin bodies, man.
[167:32.51]They're after me.
[167:34.13]Skin bodies?
[167:35.23]Sounds like a pack of belligerent nudists.
[167:37.49]Oh, no.
[167:38.15]The skin bodies are like skinheads, but 10 times worse.
[167:42.01]Sure they're not 100 times worse?
[167:44.05]Yeah, maybe 100 times, maybe a million.
[167:51.45]These skin bodies, what exactly are they doing to you?
[167:54.92]They're stealing my, I mean, pinching my shaving cream.
[168:00.78]Of all the things of yours they could pinch, why the shaving cream?
[168:04.99]So they can shave their bodies, of course.
[168:07.63]Of course?
[168:08.51]They shave their whole bodies?
[168:11.43]Yeah, what happened to your security?
[168:12.51]Not to be rude, but why is it the best in the world?
[168:14.51]Best security in the world.
[168:17.14]Well, after the whole video delivery conspiracy, I figured I better build something to keep people from bringing stuff into my store.
[168:24.71]So?
[168:25.49]So, I needed to borrow some of the high-tech detective parts from BTEC.
[168:30.51]Meaning nothing's stopping people from taking stuff out of the store anymore.
[168:34.11]Dash it all.
[168:35.95]I knew I forgot something.
[168:38.20]More don't subs.
[168:42.60]I think we're at over 100.
[168:48.32]What did you say those skin bodies were doing?
[168:50.94]They're pinching my skin.
[168:53.77]Thank you so much, Jerma's Average Dong.
[168:57.21]Hundred Dongs.
[169:01.65]Too many Dongs.
[169:05.06]Thanks, Bosco.
[169:06.14]Pip-Pip!
[169:06.94]Honey Nut Chili!
[169:07.84]Please don't ban me.
[169:10.66]I'm not gonna ban you.
[169:13.30]Stay out of the loo!
[169:16.39]It's Nakat!
[169:22.70]Too many dongs too little time.
[169:32.05]Alright, shaving cream.
[169:32.93]Is this it?
[169:33.25]What?
[169:33.35]Ugh.
[169:33.47]Whipped liverwurst?
[169:34.99]That's fucking gross.
[169:47.48]So I can take the shaving cream.
[169:48.90]Why are they shooting the gun in here?
[169:51.64]They just... Alright, that was insane.
[170:16.59]Speaking of insane, we had 10 more coming right there.
[170:20.71]Holy shit.
[170:21.16]Uh, did I put the volume too low?
[170:24.62]I think that's alright.
[170:43.91]We gotta chase down those hairless rats.
[170:47.11]Oh wait, what about buying things?
[170:52.23]It's for your vacation.
[170:53.99]Oh, I appreciate that.
[170:54.81]This is in the rat movie.
[170:57.93]Wait, wait, what?
[170:58.82]No!
[170:59.02]I can't.
[170:59.32]No, I can't.
[170:59.64]I have to go.
[171:25.50]Is that them?
[171:26.38]Alright, well, their car probably is very, very slow.
[171:29.71]I get in my car.
[171:32.61]Or can I just grab them when they drive by?
[171:34.17]Extra dongs.
[171:38.03]Ten more dongs.
[171:45.79]It's not an average dong anymore.
[171:50.36]It's too... It's too big.
[171:53.14]No, I just said that.
[171:54.24]No, but listen.
[171:56.24]It's a lot of money.
[171:57.40]I just hope that you're financially able to... How do those laughingly small wheels move so fast?
[172:03.69]It's too many dung.
[172:04.85]How do I drive?
[172:06.19]Take the wheel, little buddy.
[172:10.04]I thought you'd never ask.
[172:26.00]Tires?
[172:26.46]Trying to drive him into something?
[172:31.05]Grandpa Simpson!
[172:34.89]That was a bad Grandpa Simpson, but it's very loud.
[172:57.35]Grandpa Simpson.
[173:07.24]That's a good, that was a pretty good take on that one.
[173:12.24]Alright, so what the hell, why, what's the deal with that?
[173:21.71]Can I now go back in here?
[173:31.19]They rule these streets.
[173:34.47]Took care of your rat problem now.
[173:36.17]Sell me some cheese.
[173:36.99]Is this gonna be another tear gas?
[173:57.68]What peculiar device are you so eager to pawn off on us this time?
[174:01.20]It's the latest in Bosco tech innovation.
[174:04.24]A delightful invention I like to call a chemical-based voice modulator.
[174:09.30]Voice modulator?
[174:10.28]What's that?
[174:11.30]I do believe it's self-explanatory.
[174:14.56]We don't really have time to explain it to ourselves.
[174:17.34]Why don't you just explain it to us?
[174:19.40]Well, it alters the frequency of your voice molecules.
[174:23.78]Very useful, very useful.
[174:27.85]Can we just have it?
[174:28.51]Or is it 10 grand?
[174:30.11]Is everything 10 grand in this game?
[174:31.75]That would be 30 shillings.
[174:34.08]Yeah, I left our shillings in my other pants.
[174:36.46]How much in dollars?
[174:38.04]Let's see here.
[174:40.52]30 shillings would be about 1 million American dollars.
[174:45.34]A million bucks?
[174:46.48]No way are we giving out that many tickets.
[174:49.41]I think we'll have to find an entirely new revenue stream if we want that voice modulator.
[174:54.11]Worth every shilling.
[174:55.31]Trust me, trust me.
[174:57.69]okay so no let's say that again we'd like that that will be we'll be back later once we find out now we need to become millionaires nothing for uh what does this do hands in the air bosco you're coming with us good heavens what is we're taking you in for masquerading as a man of class and distinction what the devil surely you chest
[175:24.64]Yes, surely we do.
[175:26.38]On the bright side, now you can add the release to your long list of paranoia-induced nightmare subjects.
[175:32.57]Alright, see you later, Bosco.
[175:35.89]Thanks, Bosco.
[175:36.99]Hello, sir.
[175:37.81]There's another option?
[175:48.38]We want to buy something.
[175:49.94]Oh, is it different this time?
[175:52.42]Do you have any complimentary fresh garlic?
[175:55.20]No.
[175:57.66]Do you have any fine leather jackets?
[176:00.44]No.
[176:02.68]It's different every time.
[176:03.36]Do you have any gumballs the size of your head?
[176:06.54]No.
[176:08.98]Do you have any +2 plate armor of limitless squeezability?
[176:16.24]Do you have any Pez dispensers with the head of infamous Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa?
[176:22.16]Nope.
[176:24.70]Do you have any ketchup?
[176:27.55]Nope.
[176:28.49]Oh, wait.
[176:29.15]Got you.
[176:30.69]Blast.
[176:31.55]Drat.
[176:32.39]Dash at all.
[176:35.67]Can I have it?
[176:37.49]Nothing for us right now.
[176:39.00]Let's go back the other way.
[176:39.96]How's the psychoanalyst doing?
[176:43.12]Thanks, Bosco.
[176:52.60]Bombs?
[176:53.70]Rope?
[176:54.70]Lamp oil?
[176:56.89]It's all yours, friend.
[176:58.61]As long as you have enough rubies.
[177:02.57]That's an old one.
[177:08.09]Isn't it beautiful?
[177:15.09]Garden.
[177:20.76]Those are old
[177:23.22]That's seriously one of my first experiences with memology, you know what I mean?
[177:33.85]What?
[177:34.30]What?
[177:44.28]She's gonna change careers every episode.
[178:00.29]So you're a publisher now?
[178:01.67]What happened to psychotherapy?
[178:03.29]I've always had a fascination with the suppressed and the sensual, and for telling people too much about both.
[178:08.91]Publishing the Alien Love Triangle Times is a logical extension of all my previous careers.
[178:14.00]Except maybe Vatican spokesperson.
[178:19.56]You don't do psychotherapy anymore.
[178:21.24]Are you doing any psychotherapy on the side?
[178:23.71]Only on space aliens.
[178:25.67]I guess that narrows your clientele quite a bit.
[178:28.21]No, not really.
[178:31.65]What was it you said about a photo?
[178:33.61]My new tabloid, the Alien Love Triangle Times, needs a cover photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity, or alien as the unwashed masses calls them, caught getting cozy with some of the locals.
[178:46.48]Sybil, I'd like the record to show that although I support you as a friend, your latest project makes my skin decidedly crawly.
[178:53.49]Me too.
[178:54.31]And I like that tie.
[178:55.21]I like that tie.
[178:59.05]I want this tie as a shirt.
[179:03.59]I'd wear it.
[179:08.83]Psychoanalyze me again.
[179:12.63]Oh, alright.
[179:13.97]Think of a number between one and four.
[179:16.99]Two.
[179:17.77]Two.
[179:18.47]You're selectively audio-averse.
[179:21.34]I don't like the sound of that.
[179:22.40]Alright, what do you need to do?
[179:28.52]You're looking for a cover photo of little green men canoodling, right?
[179:32.13]Yeah, though I'm kind of desperate at this point.
[179:34.55]Basically, I can use anything as long as there are three beings in the shot and at least one of them's an alien.
[179:40.53]It is the Alien Love Triangle Times, after all.
[179:42.25]So I need three people in a picture, and one's going to be an alien.
[179:46.88]There's nothing like good, hard-nosed journalism.
[179:49.74]You said it.
[179:51.00]It's time to find out the real answers to the real questions.
[179:55.92]Like what did those poor cattle do to deserve that?
[179:58.71]No.
[179:59.51]What do aliens do for romance?
[180:01.93]Do they love?
[180:03.15]How do they get their otherworldly thrills?
[180:06.56]By playing slots in Kino?
[180:08.24]That'd explain why they're always seen in Nevada.
[180:11.96]No, you got me, Wokka.
[180:13.22]Except fuck Kino.
[180:16.60]Kino sucks.
[180:19.29]Have you learned anything interesting since you started this magazine?
[180:23.19]I learned why Elvis had such an otherworldly voice.
[180:26.39]You are right.
[180:26.86]Is that the fir- Luke, is that the first thing you've written all stream?
[180:55.93]Who else is an alien?
[180:56.98]Is anybody else an alien that we might not know about?
[180:59.80]Dr. Phil.
[181:00.96]Well, that goes without saying.
[181:04.88]I can see that.
[181:05.38]That makes sense.
[181:09.30]Dr. Phil really does come off as the kind of guy that, after the show, and that's the whole thing.
[181:14.51]See you next time when we enlist someone else.
[181:16.83]Get off of here.
[181:17.35]Get out of here.
[181:19.13]You're a dumb idiot.
[181:19.93]Get out of here.
[181:20.89]And he goes backstage and like, his skin just fucking falls off of him.
[181:26.77]And he, like, gets in a bath.
[181:32.15]An alien bath.
[181:39.21]I can see it.
[181:40.79]In fact, if I had to name you, like, ten people that I think might be an alien... Dr. Phil would be in number eight.
[181:48.22]I think.
[181:53.70]This is... They knew what they were doing.
[181:57.83]What's in an alien bath?
[181:59.23]It's a regular bath.
[182:00.53]Except there's an alien in it this time.
[182:05.27]And they add, like, other, like, spices in it and shit.
[182:11.41]We'll be back.
[182:12.58]Keep watching the supplies.
[182:18.44]There's, like, coriander and, like, cumin and fucking, like, cilantro.
[182:26.49]Alright, let's look at some of this stuff.
[182:28.53]There's, like, oregano in it and... Tabasco sauce and shit.
[182:30.45]They put, like, all kinds of weird stuff in it.
[182:32.82]There's nothing weird.
[182:33.90]Like, stuff's, like, good.
[182:34.72]What am I talking about?
[182:36.04]A Memeograph!
[182:36.44]I love Solange, really.
[182:37.42]Yeah, I do.
[182:37.88]It's so good.
[182:58.60]Okay, so we need a picture.
[182:59.55]What, mayonnaise?
[183:05.13]This is not the exit!
[183:06.37]God damn it.
[183:07.81]I do it every time.
[183:08.93]Cilantro just tastes like I'm eating grass and chemicals.
[183:26.31]Yeah, only us aliens know how to take it.
[183:28.73]You have to be an alien to like cilantro.
[183:45.00]It's kind of weird because cilantro... The way cilantro smells... I don't want it near me.
[183:50.40]It's kind of like the way that I think a mosquito feels.
[183:53.24]When you have off on your body.
[183:56.54]If cilantro comes near me, I'm like, no, get that away.
[183:58.90]I don't want it near me.
[184:04.84]But I like to have it the way it tastes.
[184:11.58]Oh, there's actually new gumballs in here.
[184:12.82]It looks like candy, but I'm pretty sure it's fish tank gravel again.
[184:16.77]Yeah, cilantro smells like a mosquito field when they're approaching somebody with off on their body.
[184:25.85]You know you can just sense something, that something's wrong, and you just don't want to be near it?
[184:30.85]There is people repellent.
[184:33.37]Off.
[184:33.75]O-F-F.
[184:34.53]Off.
[184:35.01]You don't know what off is.
[184:36.32]Off.
[184:37.04]The spray.
[184:37.66]The mosquito spray.
[184:39.54]You put it all over your body.
[184:42.56]Off.
[184:44.44]O-F-F.
[184:45.50]It's the number one name brand mosquito repellent in the world, probably.
[184:51.08]You don't use raid on your body.
[184:52.56]You use off.
[184:57.64]Off and cilantro smell the same.
[184:59.12]Are you trying to tell us you don't like this?
[185:07.54]No, don't use raid.
[185:09.80]Raid money!
[185:10.68]Alright, what am I doing?
[185:13.10]I need a picture.
[185:15.76]Can I go anywhere to get this?
[185:16.78]Okay, picture.
[185:17.65]I need a photo.
[185:20.71]Photo of aliens.
[185:23.39]There was another place over here that I didn't get to see before.
[185:30.79]Zoomers don't use bug spray.
[185:38.48]What do you mean?
[185:40.86]What do you do?
[185:45.74]What do you do instead of bug spray?
[185:49.99]Light a couple of candles?
[185:55.23]Where we going, Sam?
[185:59.09]The TV studio.
[186:01.80]You guys do cilantro candles?
[186:03.80]No, what's it called?
[186:04.52]It's got a certain name.
[186:06.50]Cilantro candles.
[186:07.73]They're all the same thing.
[186:08.51]They smell the same.
[186:09.77]Citronella.
[186:10.37]Cilantro.
[186:11.35]Citrus cilantro-nella.
[186:12.27]I thought citronella was citrus.
[186:14.21]No, it's cilantro.
[186:29.33]Mysteriously so.
[186:30.89]Well, let's find this Myra character and smack some good old-fashioned sense into her.
[186:35.90]I don't care if we smack it into her or smack it out of her, just so long as there's smacking involved.
[186:40.98]You crack me up, little buddy.
[186:44.42]Citrine candles burn into plasma.
[186:48.21]Don't do that.
[186:48.97]Be careful.
[186:50.15]Need a broom, little buddy?
[186:51.95]I don't use brooms, Sam.
[186:53.71]I necessitate the use of them.
[187:04.52]Director's chair.
[187:05.22]Let me sit in that and see how it feels.
[187:06.42]It's got a falling star.
[187:08.94]Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
[187:11.05]Feels pretty good.
[187:12.01]How I wonder how you'll crash and burn.
[187:15.79]Uh, yeah.
[187:17.61]No, no, don't make me do it.
[187:19.27]Don't make me do it.
[187:23.13]No!
[187:26.32]Alright, I died.
[187:30.02]I got it.
[187:30.36]I'm fine.
[187:33.47]Stand aside, casually attired stagehand.
[187:36.33]We're Sam and Max, freelance police.
[187:38.99]Fight it, fight it.
[187:39.65]We've come to save some pathetic hostages from the clutches of... Okay, I'm going to stop you right there.
[187:44.21]Number one, I'm not a stagehand.
[187:45.84]I am the director.
[187:46.96]The director.
[187:47.82]Number two, we're no longer holding the auditions for animal cops with crippling mental disabilities and a lust for dance.
[187:54.86]Oh no, we're not actors.
[187:56.58]You got that right.
[187:57.48]I don't think I've ever seen worse acting in my entire life.
[188:00.14]And yes, I have seen Keanu Reeves' performance in Toast, the musical.
[188:04.22]Sam, I think my hypersensitive ego may need stroking.
[188:07.79]Don't look at me.
[188:08.93]Next?
[188:09.65]Who's next?
[188:13.99]Uh, we're the police.
[188:15.03]You don't seem to understand.
[188:16.81]We're highly untrained police officers.
[188:19.67]Look, hats off for dedication, guys, but I'm just not buying the police act.
[188:23.86]I feel so invalidated.
[188:27.34]Where is it?
[188:28.38]We're looking for Myra Stump.
[188:29.66]Myra Stump.
[188:31.04]Do not mention that name in my presence.
[188:34.22]Which name?
[188:34.98]Myra or Stump?
[188:36.51]Either and or both.
[188:38.69]What's your beef with Myra?
[188:40.19]Let's just say Myra and I have creative differences.
[188:43.17]I'm creative and she isn't.
[188:47.49]I'm sorry.
[188:48.25]What was your question?
[188:52.18]Why don't you like Myra?
[188:54.16]Why the hate?
[188:55.24]Look, Myra runs her show her way, and I run every other show my way.
[188:59.20]If she doesn't want me on her set, I could care less.
[189:01.86]You mean you couldn't care less.
[189:04.00]If you could care less, then you do care some, which doesn't really... No, I was right.
[189:08.65]I could care less, because I care even less about what you're saying right now.
[189:12.81]Oh, bang!
[189:14.33]Quiet, knucklehead.
[189:16.39]Knucklehead?
[189:19.24]What are you doing here anyhow?
[189:20.92]What am I doing here?
[189:22.34]I'm holding auditions for Midtown Cowboys.
[189:24.45]What are you doing here?
[189:26.33]Midtown Cowboys?
[189:27.63]The critically panned but publicly adored sitcom about two cattle ranchers trying to make it in Midtown Manhattan?
[189:33.13]Yes, well summarized.
[189:35.07]You're hiring extras?
[189:36.88]No, I'm hiring the stars.
[189:38.88]The two main characters went on Myra a couple days ago and I haven't heard from them since.
[189:43.01]I need replacements ASAP.
[189:45.13]Sam, did you hear that?
[189:46.51]If we can pass one lousy audition, sitcom stardom will finally be ours!
[189:51.45]Rocketing to fame for the most insubstantial of reasons.
[189:54.65]That truly is the American dream.
[189:58.02]We would like to audition, please.
[189:59.14]Would you like to apply for that instant stardom you promised?
[190:02.11]You want to audition?
[190:03.57]Well, if there were anybody else here, I'd tell you to forget it, but okay.
[190:08.64]Alright!
[190:09.86]What do we do?
[190:10.86]I'm going to have you play a scene from Old Yeller.
[190:13.42]Tell me you've seen it.
[190:15.15]I'm not into horror movies.
[190:17.83]Oh, horror movies.
[190:18.67]I forgot to tell you guys this.
[190:19.77]Alright, alright, alright.
[190:21.15]I want to get a second.
[190:22.29]Listen to this.
[190:24.01]This is a dentist story.
[190:24.62]What's my motivation?
[190:25.64]Um... Grr.
[190:44.02]No!
[190:44.58]Dig deep!
[190:45.46]You should be just... ...throthing mad!
[190:48.93]Hmm...
[190:58.14]What are you doing?
[190:59.24]Sorry, I'm not hiring a dog who can't even do a simple rabidity scene.
[191:03.27]I don't know.
[191:04.29]I don't know.
[191:04.91]I was feeling rabid.
[191:06.15]You look pretty disease-ridden to me.
[191:08.01]Come back after you've taken a few thousand acting classes.
[191:10.12]I was acting rabid.
[191:11.18]Alright.
[191:12.54]Well, listen.
[191:12.94]Hold on.
[191:13.14]This is important.
[191:13.70]Anyways.
[191:14.92]So, I'm at the dentist today, right?
[191:18.69]Sit down, we're going over some stuff, I do some x-rays, and I'm lying back, and they have a TV on the wall.
[191:26.65]Some dentists do this now, they have monitors in each room.
[191:32.40]So I'm sitting there, and there's Netflix on it.
[191:36.07]And they're like, oh, okay, cool, this is actually a pretty cool idea.
[191:39.05]You just can have, like, TV there?
[191:41.61]Like, that's fucking ridiculous.
[191:42.79]That's really, really awesome.
[191:45.06]So, the dentist is just like, hey man, like, yeah, while you're waiting, while you're chilling around, while we're doing some stuff, you know, you can just browse and put on whatever you want.
[191:52.62]I'm like, okay, cool.
[191:56.48]And, you know how you can see, like, what people have seen already on Netflix?
[192:01.65]And the queue of stuff that has already been watched?
[192:07.40]One of the last things that was on was a bunch of horror movies, like Friday the 13th, like Freddy.
[192:14.74]Why the fuck would you ever watch Friday the 13th when you were getting dental work?
[192:19.24]That's terrifying.
[192:22.64]It was like at least two or three fucking messed up horror movies.
[192:26.44]I'm just sitting there going, imagine lying there and watching like Jason tear somebody in half with like a chainsaw while there's a guy in your mouth.
[192:40.09]With dentist tools And I don't know if anybody else is like this But I have this weird thing where I don't want anyone to know the things that I want to watch on TV Is that weird?
[192:55.92]I hovered over a show about wine And I didn't want to put it on Because it was like a wine documentary
[193:06.49]And I just felt like people were going to judge my taste or something.
[193:09.21]I'm trying to think of what's the most normal background thing I could possibly put on.
[193:15.16]I'm scrolling through.
[193:16.72]You've got home fiction and then sell it.
[193:21.38]But I'm like, that's too normal.
[193:22.52]That's like too weird.
[193:23.42]Why would I watch that show?
[193:25.46]I'm like, oh, like a food show.
[193:27.64]Those are really easy.
[193:29.39]Just put on like a food documentary about like sushi.
[193:32.73]But why would I watch that while I'm getting my teeth looked at?
[193:36.45]No.
[193:37.59]It was freaking me out.
[193:39.39]I'm just sitting in the chair.
[193:40.19]I don't know what to put on.
[193:41.21]And then I scrolled over, like, animation.
[193:42.71]Like, what's, like, is it an animated show?
[193:44.01]No, like, what if I put on, like, a kid's show?
[193:45.45]I don't want to put on, like, a kid's show.
[193:46.71]Why are you watching, like, a kid's show?
[193:50.17]What, are you weird?
[193:51.45]No, no, I just, I don't know what to put on.
[193:54.32]Maybe that is why people put on horror movies.
[193:56.20]Seriously, it was crazy.
[194:04.55]But yeah, the last thing that somebody watched, they were trying to get on Friday the 13th.
[194:12.96]How it's made, but, and what, okay, what, and then I was thinking how funny it would be if I did, if I put on, like, a dentist documentary.
[194:21.62]I'm trying to think, wouldn't that be funny?
[194:24.60]He's at the dentist, he's like, oh yeah, go ahead and put on whatever you want, and I put on, like, a dentist thing?
[194:28.82]Like a dentist show?
[194:30.26]Would that be weird?
[194:30.92]Would they think I was fucking crazy?
[194:39.26]Like, oh, like, tooth exam.
[194:40.95]Go to, like, the app and just type in, like, tooth examinations and see if there's, like, a tooth exam miniseries.
[194:51.19]What's a- what is a fucking dentist show?
[194:55.63]There is no dentist show.
[194:56.87]I'm just- that's a whole nother question.
[194:59.09]First of all, there's a ton of doctor shows.
[195:02.00]House.
[195:03.02]Uh, Nip Tuck.
[195:04.26]You got ER.
[195:05.44]Where are the dentist shows?
[195:10.76]Why is there no big dentist drama?
[195:22.01]There should be.
[195:25.49]Sweeney Todd was a dentist.
[195:26.65]No, he was a shaver.
[195:34.39]Hello again.
[195:35.47]Yes?
[195:37.91]Can we take another crack at that audition?
[195:39.71]But no, I thought it was funny that somebody decided to put on a horror movie while they were getting their teeth worked on.
[195:50.38]Cut!
[195:50.92]Quit stalling and act... Oh, and she said... She said the word rabbit.
[195:56.67]So I clicked on the rabbit.
[195:58.81]I heard rabbit.
[196:01.29]Hello again.
[196:02.39]Yes?
[196:04.35]Can we take another crack at that audition?

[196:38.50]Thank you, thank you.
[196:40.44]First off, I'd like to thank all the little people who... It's different.
[196:44.88]Okay, Max.
[196:45.70]Just realized your dog is walking death, and you'll have to put him down for the sake of society.
[196:50.81]Really?
[196:51.67]You're sad!
[196:52.49]You're despondent!
[196:53.51]You're grief-stricken!
[196:54.75]Now!
[196:55.23]Uh, boo-hoo?

[197:24.23]Perfect.
[197:24.89]Now, the fateful moment has arrived.
[197:27.38]Despite your immense grief, you must put your beloved companion out of his misery.
[197:32.18]Okay.
[197:33.20]Uh-oh.
[197:38.66]Idiot.
[197:39.46]What demonic force possessed you to do that?
[197:41.93]The demonic force called acting, Sam.
[197:44.73]You should try it sometime.
[197:46.27]Good thing I had my anti-hypnosis helmet built into my hat, or I'd have one too many holes in the head.
[197:52.23]Okay.
[197:52.35]You did actually shoot me.
[197:53.87]That's where there's no joke.
[197:55.29]Scaffold.
[197:55.80]Scaffold.
[198:18.55]Hey, even the scaffold is just a prop.
[198:21.13]Scaffold?
[198:21.45]Yeah, from that show about the TV crew that solves crimes around the station using advanced forensics and overly dramatic reenactments.
[198:28.13]Come on.
[198:28.89]Whoever heard of a crime at a TV station?
[198:32.73]I'm getting pretty good at it.
[198:38.26]The Barrel Haven.
[198:40.02]From whence comes this storybook set?
[198:42.30]From whence comes this storybook set?
[198:43.60]Clearly from a work of unparalleled artistic vision and emotional expressiveness.
[198:47.66]No wonder I haven't seen it.
[198:57.84]Once used for apples, now used for derrieres.
[199:02.76]Sitcom Room Midtown Cowboys.
[199:07.15]Midtown Cowboys that away Alright people let's get the stage set up celebrity host will be here any minute oh right audible boredom no I'm just hanging out I'm not bored I'm not really not this is actually fun I'm not bored I'm not bored
[199:37.71]Weren't you just... I think she just defied the laws of physics.
[199:41.91]Sorry.
[199:42.39]You'd be amazed how many times a day I have to do that.
[199:44.54]Things tend to be hectic here.
[199:46.34]Doesn't bother us a bit.
[199:47.80]Sam and Max, consummate professional actors, reporting for duty.
[199:52.66]You said duty, Sam.
[199:54.56]I knew you guys were ripe for this show.
[199:57.06]Speaking of which, could you perhaps explain the show a bit?
[200:00.24]Okay, here's the drill.
[200:01.35]On Midtown Cowboy, you play a pair of cattle ranchers trying to raise a herd in an apartment in Manhattan.
[200:06.69]My uncle Ernie did that, except it was pigs.
[200:09.33]And not in an apartment.
[200:10.97]I only see one cow.
[200:12.57]It's a small herd.
[200:13.59]You're struggling, okay?
[200:15.33]Okay.
[200:16.29]You've got this landlord, Mr. Featherly, who has a very strict no-cows policy.
[200:20.68]Devilishly inconvenient.
[200:22.54]I begin to see from whence the hilarity sprouts.
[200:25.86]Yes, Featherly is always barging in, and you try to hide the fact that you have a cow in the apartment.
[200:30.08]Lots of sight gags, usually something gross winds up happening.
[200:33.14]Simple enough?
[200:34.26]Great.
[200:34.86]Where's the script?
[200:36.27]Well, there's a slight hitch.
[200:37.83]The cow ate most of the script, so you're going to have to ad-lib the show.
[200:40.97]Perfect.
[200:41.47]I'm good at doing that.
[200:42.49]Yes, make it up as you go.
[200:44.01]Improvise.
[200:44.92]I can do that.
[200:45.64]I guess our regular life has given us plenty of practice.
[200:48.76]Don't worry.
[200:49.28]You'll be working with Philo Pennyworth, who plays Featherly.
[200:51.96]He's a brilliant actor, classically trained.
[200:54.24]Globe theater and all that.
[200:55.60]Just set him up to do something funny, and he'll handle it from there.
[200:58.72]Check.
[200:59.40]Anything else?
[201:00.72]actually yes we did save one line from the script and it's really important to work it in because it's the product placement that pays for the whole show one of you will have to say the line me me pick me alright max your line is this better get the serious toothpaste oh you're gonna go to jail I like it already
[201:22.89]What's this show about again?
[201:28.30]Midtown Cowboys is about two cattle ranchers raising a herd in a Manhattan apartment that has a strict no-cows policy.
[201:35.52]Your basic visual hijinks and occasional gross-out humor ensue as they concoct elaborate ruses to keep their cow hidden from their landlord, Mr. Featherly.
[201:44.20]Alright.
[201:45.52]And Max's line is, better get the serious toothpaste.
[201:49.52]Oh, yeah.
[201:51.27]Let's go.
[201:52.26]We're as ready as we're ever going to be.
[201:54.00]Let's start taping the show.
[201:55.74]Okay, now remember, your landlord's at the door, and you don't want him to know you've got a cow in the house.
[202:00.64]Ready?
[202:00.94]Action!
[202:02.28]Hey, what's up?
[202:04.18]No, it's not me.
[202:04.87]It's them doing it.
[202:06.35]They're probably hiding a cow.
[202:10.29]Open up in there.
[202:11.69]I know you're hiding a cow.
[202:14.73]Hey, bossy.
[202:15.65]Hey, bossy.
[202:16.99]Hey!
[202:19.36]I don't care if it is just a problem.
[202:21.17]Open up.
[202:24.91]Open up in there.
[202:26.32]I know you're hiding a cow.
[202:30.74]Somebody has to hide the cow, though.
[202:32.85]Hey, bossy.
[202:42.68]I didn't hide the cow.
[202:45.36]Yeah, well, how am I supposed to hide the cow?
[202:47.18]With a couch?
[203:08.74]There's like poo on the ground, books, television.
[203:11.22]How convenient.
[203:12.56]And if the show they're watching is the show of themselves watching, the universe could fold in on itself and explode.
[203:17.36]When I click on the camera, it just goes, hey, boss.
[203:18.70]Best leave it turned off then.
[203:20.74]Okay, cactus window.
[203:22.32]Embarrassing idle door.
[203:24.04]TV camera.
[203:24.58]What's embarrassing idle door?
[203:26.14]Hi, mom.
[203:30.14]I think they put a drape on it or something.
[203:34.43]What's in here?
[203:41.08]I just don't see how you can sing and be a judge.
[203:43.52]I don't think the public would swallow that.
[203:45.64]Hey, Sam, do my eyes deceive me, or are those our formerly hypnotized former child star acquaintances, the soda poppers?
[203:53.37]Sweet jellyfish paced on a stick, you're right.
[203:56.17]What are the odds?
[203:57.65]Could we find another judge?
[203:59.71]What about one of those guys?
[204:02.85]Hmm, I don't suppose either of you would be interested in being a judge on Embarrassing Idol, the hearty show where we make uncomfortable entertainment out of people's misplaced faith in their own seniority.
[204:12.49]Oh, me, me.
[204:13.17]I promise I'll be completely unbiased in my abuse of the contestants.
[204:17.21]Fine, fine.
[204:18.05]Take a seat.
[204:19.91]Goody, I get to sing.
[204:23.01]Welcome back to Embarrassing Idol.
[204:25.03]The judges are chomping at the bit, so say hello to our first contestant, Peepers.
[204:31.44]You drop into a shark Well that was a bit sloppy, but I particularly like how you hit that high note that always impresses me I think you'll get my vote I
[204:49.37]I'm definitely voting for you.
[204:51.33]After all, you are my brother.
[204:54.31]Very impressive.
[204:55.61]You sound almost exactly like a sick cat being dragged through rusty farm machinery.
[204:59.96]But this is a singing contest, so I think I'll have to vote for someone else.
[205:04.54]Um, is there anyone else?
[205:06.50]Not so far.
[205:07.66]Yay!
[205:14.41]Um, what about me?
[205:21.29]It's acid brain freeze.
[205:23.21]Don't you ever watch the show?
[205:27.14]Hey, can I try my pipes out on this thing?
[205:29.32]Go right ahead.
[205:30.32]Frankly, we can use all the contestants we can muster.
[205:32.84]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our next contestant, Sam.
[205:40.28]Hello, I'd like to do a little show.
[205:42.76]No, no.
[205:46.11]Busted downhound dog blues.
[205:48.99]Love has a thorny backside.
[205:51.21]Bottleneck on the freeway of doom.
[205:52.87]Just like someone else's song, only somehow better.
[205:55.65]Bottleneck on the freeway of doom.
[205:57.64]Bottleneck on the freeway of doom.
[206:03.94]I am in a terrible torment.
[206:06.04]I am unbelievably happy.
[206:07.42]I am cryptic and therefore deep.
[206:09.69]I am more successful than you.
[206:11.43]Chomping on a crunchy silver spoon.
[206:18.48]My girl's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[206:19.96]My girl's cheating on me.
[206:21.72]I've solved life's greatest mystery, but I'm not telling.
[206:23.70]I'm cooler and hipper than you will ever be.
[206:28.60]She's at brunch today with some baboon.
[206:34.56]Pity me, admire me.
[206:35.56]Let me remind you that I write songs.
[206:38.50]I will say anything to make it rhyme.
[206:41.20]Blowing like a zephyr on a dune.
[206:46.86]And let's hear from our judges.
[206:49.95]Bravo!
[206:50.83]Your wobbly tenor is way better than Peepers' shrill squawking.
[206:55.11]Your stylings are quite interesting, but I noticed you never really hit a high note.
[207:00.16]Peepers is still getting my vote.
[207:02.81]It's like your best friend.
[207:03.63]What?
[207:03.87]So you're always gonna vote for your brother.
[207:05.97]So I have to hit a high note.
[207:35.56]Okay, just like Feathers and Fur- Busted Down Dog Blues.
[207:38.76]Hey, it's me, your brother!
[207:41.00]That's it.
[208:08.79]It's me, your brother.
[208:09.45]I think I'm gonna have to do, like, Helium or something.
[208:34.26]And let's hear from our judge.
[208:36.10]I admire your courage even more than your singing.
[208:38.92]Thanks, little.
[208:39.92]Nice, but I'd like to see some technical proficiency.
[208:42.58]I know.
[208:45.32]He's my brother, so I have to vote for him.
[208:48.12]Excuse me, Mr. Simpson, you gotta get out of here or you can't be in that aisle.
[208:51.94]You have to stop talking during the movie.
[208:54.75]Oh, Rick!
[208:55.71]Rick!
[208:55.95]Rick!
[209:08.78]Rick.
[209:09.26]Hey, Peepers.
[209:10.04]Well, well, Peepers.
[209:11.34]You underdeveloped former non-psychotherapist, you.
[209:14.60]What a treat to run across you again.
[209:17.16]I'm not sure if I ever properly thanked you for hitting me over that recently.
[209:20.86]I played virtual Rickiality.
[209:22.87]No gratitude necessary.
[209:24.31]Way too tired to even turn it on in the first place.
[209:26.69]It was the worst stream of 2019.
[209:27.83]How do you hit those high notes?
[209:34.38]How do you manage to hit those eardrum scarring high notes?
[209:37.77]If you're implying that I use any artificial vocal enhancements, I don't.
[209:43.06]What you hear is pure peepers.
[209:45.96]That's almost exactly what I would have said.
[209:49.09]The stream was fine.
[209:50.65]I had a lot of fun on that stream.
[209:52.90]That was a Minecraft stream, that was great.
[209:55.52]But going into that VR, going into Rick and Morty Virtual Rickality brought it down like eight letter grades.
[210:02.64]And as you know, there's only five potential letter grades you can get before an F. A, B, down to C, down to D, down to F, well A counts as one, I guess.
[210:11.51]A, B, C, D, F. And it was three under F at that point.
[210:20.75]I'm dying to know.
[210:21.90]Is there any truth to the rumors about lip-syncing on the old Soda Popper TV show?
[210:26.42]We only did that on the released version.
[210:31.37]That clip will be around until I am dead.
[210:32.95]You know what I mean?
[210:34.33]Think about that.
[210:40.49]Your lyrics have an intriguingly vapid quality.
[210:43.61]Did you write them yourself?
[210:45.41]Of course!
[210:47.01]Any similarity to lyrics from other wildly popular songs is meant as homage, not theft.
[210:52.97]The QRS clip will exist unless the internet turns off.
[211:01.98]It's worming its way into the stream every five minutes.
[211:05.96]Really?
[211:06.42]Is there any trick to hitting the high notes like you do?
[211:08.46]It's going to outlast me.
[211:10.93]I don't use any artificial vocal enhancement, and I resent the implication.
[211:16.86]I have a gift, that's all.
[211:19.50]Liar.
[211:20.90]I'll leave you to whatever.
[211:22.22]Good luck.
[211:23.72]I can smell the live breath.
[211:25.90]It stinks.
[211:29.56]Can I look at these?
[211:30.48]Sure, take them.
[211:32.74]I've got them memorized.
[211:35.10]Am I blue?
[211:36.10]Who are you?
[211:37.20]Can I fly?
[211:38.96]Very impressive.
[211:42.05]Oh, so we're going to change the lyrics is what we're saying here.
[211:46.63]Is that your mug?
[211:48.11]No, it was here when I got here.
[211:49.95]Last week.
[211:51.55]Ew.
[211:53.19]Once used for apples.
[211:55.32]Here he is.
[211:56.92]Here he is.
[211:58.76]Hey, hey, Mr. Hey, Mr. Excuse me.
[212:14.23]How do I talk to you?
[212:17.87]Tell me, old judge, what gruesome qualities do you look for in a singing performance?
[212:22.51]Fraternity.
[212:23.63]I'm voting for Peepers no matter what.
[212:26.34]He's my brother.
[212:27.90]The one who didn't forget my birthday today, I might add.
[212:31.24]Well, there you go.
[212:32.30]I said I was sorry.
[212:35.70]Oh, birthday.
[212:37.61]Hey, happy birthday.
[212:39.35]Happy birthday.
[212:40.83]Thanks.
[212:41.53]I'm glad somebody remembered.
[212:43.33]I said I was sorry.
[212:45.41]What more do you want?
[212:47.37]A tree would be nice.
[212:49.69]Isn't this also St.
[212:50.63]Boniface Day?
[212:51.89]Patron saint of carnivorous plants and spiky things?
[212:54.69]I think that's next week.
[212:55.61]Gotta get him.
[212:56.93]Okay, so I need to make my voice high and get him a present.
[213:02.30]Enjoy your judging.
[213:03.57]Catch you later.
[213:04.77]Carl Weezer?
[213:06.57]Oh, Jimmy Carl.
[213:09.23]I don't think that's gonna work.
[213:10.69]I'm close.
[213:11.39]I'm close.
[213:12.05]Real close tonight on a few of these.
[213:13.51]If I worked on them a little.
[213:15.93]It's the first time I've ever tried that.
[213:22.07]Alright, um... What do I have here?
[213:33.64]What do I do with your lyrics?
[213:36.28]Can I just, like, put his head back and say, hey, whipped cream!
[213:38.89]And just put the shaving cream in his mouth?
[213:40.75]He's too stupid to know.
[213:45.79]Okay, I don't think I can do this yet.
[213:47.27]Let's get out of here.
[213:48.33]But what about the cow thing?
[213:54.57]I don't have any money.
[214:03.37]I need a million dollars to make my voice change.
[214:09.85]Um... I'm trying with the cow again.
[214:19.40]The TV studio.
[214:20.82]Goody.
[214:36.35]Just become a millionaire.
[214:45.61]Green?
[214:46.49]Is this an alien?
[215:02.77]Remember, those are socks.
[215:06.92]What?
[215:07.46]Oh, I get it.
[215:19.03]Never make that noise again.
[215:20.07]Is this one okay?
[215:24.48]Let's have another go at that scene, shall we?
[215:26.72]Okay, now remember, your landlord's at the door and you don't want him to know you've got a cow in there.
[215:31.54]Ready?
[215:32.03]Alright, hide the cow.
[215:36.53]Punch the wall down.
[215:38.39]Spray paint.
[215:38.69]I got spray paint.
[215:41.50]Oh, that's not spray paint.
[215:43.60]It's a plate?
[215:44.70]Okay, I got a plate.
[216:05.47]Can I move a... Hide a cow.
[216:06.83]That's not a cow.
[216:07.83]That's our great Aunt Tilde.
[216:10.20]Well, well, well.
[216:10.56]Who's your guest, boys?
[216:34.18]There it is.
[216:34.70]I told you.
[216:35.68]This is every show on Nickelodeon.
[216:37.76]Every live action show on Nickelodeon.
[216:39.78]I think I saw this on Nickelodeon like 10 years ago.
[217:08.12]So I did it.
[217:08.54]I win.
[217:14.25]Better get the serious toothpaste.
[217:16.21]Wait, uh, hold on.
[217:18.43]But why do I have to say that?
[217:29.20]Alright.

[218:37.48]Wait, that is gross humor.
[218:44.20]That's disgusting.
[218:44.98]Didn't you say I want you to do something disgusting?
[218:46.54]Holy shit, okay.
[219:01.57]This is the French chef we hired to satisfy our inexplicable, insatiable craving for omelettes and duck all around.
[219:27.13]and frog's legs.
[219:28.43]I like mine extra crispy.
[219:30.39]Oh, a French chef, eh?
[219:33.60]I love French bread.
[219:34.84]I'm not skipping.
[219:35.46]I'm not pressing anymore.
[219:37.50]I went to Gapery one time myself, you know?
[219:41.17]It was back in my army days.
[220:01.27]goodness who left this lying here plate on the ship and then put shaving cream on it and pretend it's whipped cream is this actually what I'm supposed to do is make it like a pie for him to eat say what's this I'm sorry what was that you said

[220:41.06]Either one of these, right?
[220:45.46]The food.
[220:46.75]He said, moo goo bang bang.
[220:48.75]It's a French dish the chef has just made.
[220:51.29]Oh, super.

[220:57.77]So it actually is feed this person shit.
[221:06.55]This is not, like, Nickelodeon funny anymore.
[221:09.32]They don't, like, feed each other shit in Nickelodeon.
[221:11.92]There's a familiar flavor.
[221:14.22]Fennel, maybe?
[221:15.24]Kentucky bluegrass, I think.
[221:20.68]This Moo Moo whatever stuff is really good.
[221:24.58]What's it called in English?
[221:26.49]Cow pie.
[221:27.55]Really?
[221:28.15]Well, that's funny.
[221:30.21]It sounds just like... Hog champ.
[221:41.30]Hog champ.
[221:45.54]Now?
[221:46.40]Now.
[221:48.38]Better get the serious toothpaste.
[221:51.10]Zoom in.
[221:51.48]And cut.
[221:52.46]That was comic cool.
[221:55.50]The network
[221:57.07]Network's actually gonna shut it down.
[221:58.60]And your show's gonna get cancelled.
[222:02.08]Because nobody can air somebody eating shit on TV.
[222:05.66]Just to let you know.
[222:06.54]It was plastic?
[222:07.68]Doesn't matter.
[222:08.16]Disgusting.
[222:08.54]Revolting.
[222:09.54]Want nothing to do with it.
[222:11.82]Disgusting.
[222:25.14]Okay, so this is how they used to clip it.
[222:27.24]This is how they used to clip stuff back then.
[222:32.44]Alright, so where's my money?
[222:35.20]Midtown Convoy, where's my money?
[222:51.38]Cooking show.
[222:54.40]Where's my fucking money?
[222:56.82]Cooking without looking.
[222:57.81]Okay, there's lard.
[223:04.31]That's enough lard to clog the arteries of a major metropolis.
[223:08.39]Or start a circus of greased squirrels.
[223:11.17]I rue the day you lost your NEA funding, Max.
[223:18.60]Bridge, pot, pan, plate.
[223:20.16]Alright, it's just... That should be easy.
[223:26.47]What's the story with this show?
[223:27.65]How are you always everywhere before us?
[223:29.45]Alien, how do you keep it so clean in here?
[223:31.69]What's the story with this?
[223:32.43]What's the story with this show?
[223:34.29]Cooking without looking?
[223:35.44]It's a cooking show aimed at Motorhead bachelors who have never seen the inside of a grocery store.
[223:39.94]Is there a big demand for that?
[223:41.52]You'd be amazed.
[223:45.24]Uh, where's the host?
[223:45.90]Where's the host?
[223:47.08]Is he in watching the Myra show?
[223:48.94]No, he's one of the few who isn't.
[223:50.52]He got food poisoning while he was taping last week's show.
[223:53.24]Right in the middle, in fact.
[223:55.10]Was it gruesome?
[223:56.31]Yes, and unfortunately, this show goes out live.
[223:59.39]Live?
[224:03.65]How do you keep it so clean in here?
[224:05.27]The cooking stream went through.
[224:11.75]Tell me this then, lady.
[224:12.41]Trade secret, honey!
[224:40.04]This one.
[224:40.48]Can we get a tape of the show?
[224:42.19]This one?
[224:42.89]No.
[224:43.31]It's broadcast live.
[224:44.19]We don't tape it.
[224:48.61]See ya.
[224:49.54]Probably.
[224:55.62]Welcome to Cooking Without Looking, the cooking show for the typical bachelor kitchen, containing no fruits, vegetables, or healthy ingredients of any sort.
[225:03.67]The show where we take a random assortment of condiments and barely edible items and create a meal within minutes.
[225:10.27]Filling in for Chuck Flagon this week, these guys.
[225:15.47]Just go with it.
[225:17.46]Oh, um, hello.
[225:19.10]Welcome to the show.
[225:20.18]Thanks, Sam.
[225:21.80]It's great to be here.
[225:22.84]Not you, buckethead.
[225:24.14]The audience.
[225:25.81]Oh, greetings, worshipful fans.
[225:28.75]Remember, the only reason I'm on TV is because I'm better than you.
[225:32.97]We've got some furious cooking to do, so let's get right to it.
[225:36.51]What are we making, Sam?
[225:37.65]A casserole.
[225:39.77]A cake.
[225:43.88]Today we're baking a cake.
[225:45.84]Let's visit our rack of ingredients.
[225:47.52]I'm so fucking pumped up right now.
[225:48.98]I've got to slow.
[225:49.88]I've got to calm down.
[225:50.48]I'm fucking hyped up.
[225:51.86]Max, let's leave the cooking to me and the eating to you.
[225:56.08]How do you make a cake?
[225:56.83]None of this makes cake.
[226:10.94]Lard?
[226:11.66]Lard.
[226:12.14]Asbestos.
[226:28.81]Sulfuric acid.
[226:29.67]Asbestos, sulfuric acid, and lard.
[226:31.77]This is a cake you're not giving somebody on their birthday.
[226:35.02]You're trying to kill them.
[226:36.20]And red dye too, to make it look pretty.
[226:56.08]If there's not at least some possibility of malignant tumors, it's not real bachelor cooking.
[227:02.19]And... Is that it?
[227:04.23]And then cook it.
[227:05.11]Now do we broil it, Sam?
[227:06.99]Right you are, little buddy.
[227:08.73]Into the oven it goes.
[227:10.33]And, through the magic of TV cooking show time, one gorgeous, delicious cake.
[227:15.69]Ready to be binged upon or shared amongst friends.
[227:18.66]Oh boy, let's take it with us!

[227:52.60]Max, we both know a pot is what you and I fight over when we play poker.
[227:56.77]This is the only... Alright, this is just going to be hair gel.
[228:01.21]Of course, you're going to want a few dashes of hair gel.
[228:04.41]Don't worry, bachelors.
[228:05.87]As long as you use it only for cooking, no one will think you less of a man.
[228:09.51]You go to a fine French restaurant and you order foie gras.
[228:13.93]It's got a bunch of sides.
[228:15.85]And this motherfucker comes out with a plate of hair gel.
[228:19.67]We've already got that thing we made before.
[228:22.29]No, I ate it while you were looking at the ingredients.
[228:24.79]Now do we broil it, Sam?
[228:26.10]Wait, what?

[233:46.90]As the president doubting Thomas of this crime-fighting duo, I consider it my civic duty to say, prove it.
[233:54.12]Okay.
[233:55.02]Think of something.
[233:56.00]Anything.
[234:02.53]Six million three hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred eleven.
[234:05.77]Point nine eight.
[234:06.72]Point eight.
[234:07.14]Go fuck yourself.
[234:08.66]Lucky guess.
[234:09.80]Was it?
[234:10.94]Think of something else.
[234:13.02]Um... Hublis is a big fat charlatan!
[234:19.04]Was he right?
[234:19.66]Well, we found the alien.
[234:21.07]Everyone thinks that.
[234:22.95]Oh?
[234:24.65]Found the alien.
[234:26.49]pennies on the eyes of a dead mime.
[234:29.72]Well?
[234:30.76]I must have been silently mouthing the words.
[234:33.44]Really?
[234:34.50]Think of something else.
[234:38.60]Enough of this ridiculous farce.
[234:41.16]Stop it.
[234:43.02]Do me, do me.
[234:47.25]Oh, oh my.
[234:48.81]And that's unspeakably depraved.
[234:51.73]Yeah, you got it.
[234:53.11]Wow, you're amazing.
[234:58.83]Got it.
[234:59.01]What?
[234:59.11]Chocolate covered puppies.
[235:24.56]Why would you do that?
[235:25.10]I hate this guy
[235:41.18]What's your business with Myra?
[235:42.98]I'm to be a guest on her show, silly.
[235:45.56]Yeah, silly.
[235:46.80]I'm spreading the word about my new book, Emetics, the handbook for multicolored happiness.
[235:52.64]Take a copy when you leave.
[235:54.14]Can you just give us the ten-word summary and stuff?
[235:56.18]I'm gonna read it.
[235:56.74]We're on a pretty tight schedule.
[235:58.78]Ten words.
[235:59.80]Oh, my.
[236:00.66]How about prismatology is the answer.
[236:04.78]Unicorns are pretty and rainbows, too.
[236:08.92]That's ten.
[236:11.06]Prismatology.
[236:12.68]What's the story on this, Prismatology?
[236:14.56]Yeet this guy into the sun.
[236:15.78]Prismatology is only the greatest intellectual, emotional, and spiritual revolution ever to grace this fair planet.
[236:22.92]Thank goodness we have someone who can get an impartial assessment.
[236:26.82]Tell us more.
[236:28.34]Join Prismatology today and you too can experience the magic of true bliss.
[236:35.22]That goes against everything I've ever hoped for.
[236:37.64]And yet now I'm strangely attracted to the notion.
[236:40.73]Snap out of it, little buddy.
[236:42.21]We've got a case to solve.
[236:48.19]Dazzle us with a feat of ledger domain, why don't you?
[236:51.22]Okay, I'll show you the magic of prismatology in action.
[236:55.10]Pick a color, any color.
[236:57.50]Ochre, ochre.
[236:58.72]No, mauve.
[237:00.62]Sand three.
[237:02.48]How about a color I've heard of, hmm?
[237:04.98]Pick a color, as long as it's red, green, or blue.
[237:12.10]Do blue, Hugh.
[237:17.36]Now we take the photo.
[237:19.38]Green.
[237:19.84]Alien.
[237:20.22]Photo.
[237:27.66]I challenge you to change colors again.
[237:29.94]Okay.
[237:30.73]Pick a color.
[237:32.05]Any color.
[237:34.51]It's not easy being green.
[237:36.39]Oh, but it is.
[237:37.49]With magic.
[237:46.25]How about another picture, Hublis?
[237:48.06]How about this?
[237:49.34]Instead of a new picture, we'll just recycle the old one.
[237:52.98]Save the Earth.
[237:53.86]Alien.
[237:54.22]Sure, whatever.
[237:55.64]Gather round.
[237:58.02]Got him.
[237:58.44]Exposed.
[238:00.81]Ladies and gentlemen, we got him, right?
[238:05.23]Remember that one?
[238:09.82]Sorry to interrupt your little joy fest, but I've got a situation here.
[238:13.05]Never fear, pretty lady.
[238:14.83]Hugh Bliss is here.
[238:16.13]Seen that video before.
[238:18.22]And he still hasn't come out.
[238:19.32]Think he can fill in till he gets back?
[238:21.56]Can a butterfly fly?
[238:27.15]You're 12 months late.
[238:28.39]I'm doing it.
[238:28.99]I'm doing an ironic bit about how like if everyone knows that and it's in a bunch of videos and stuff.
[238:31.97]It's irony.
[238:56.04]You guys wouldn't know irony.
[238:57.22]Only thing you know about irony is ironing your clothes in the morning or something.
[239:04.68]That's where I'd stand if I were the host, which I'm not.
[239:14.79]We've got a contestant, people!
[239:16.53]Hit it!
[239:19.47]From somewhere deep within the bowels of WARP, it's Who's Never Going to Be a Millionaire with special guest host, Hugh Bliss.
[239:30.28]Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[239:32.50]Our first contestants are a pair of professional freelance police officers.
[239:36.54]They enjoy firing their guns randomly and running over things.
[239:40.12]Please welcome Sam and Max.
[239:42.49]Still says episode one?
[239:43.35]Oh, shit, you're right.
[239:43.81]I'm going to change it.
[239:45.98]Listen, Sam, they love us.
[239:48.58]Welcome.
[239:49.80]You know the rules.
[239:50.98]If you can answer one question correctly, you'll walk away a millionaire.
[239:57.57]Start loading the armored cars, Hugh, because my brain's stuffed with enough worthless trivia to power a small Chilean village for decades.
[240:05.01]It's true.
[240:07.66]OK, are you ready?
[240:08.92]Why is he still green?
[240:12.49]Oh, happy day.
[240:13.95]It's an easy one.
[240:15.09]This is to answer one question right.
[240:16.69]If a man sets out from the Horsehead Nebula in a spaceship traveling at thrice the speed of light and his father leaves from Rigel II at the same time going half the speed, how many nanoseconds will it be before time paradox causes the first man never to have been born?
[240:33.83]Eight.
[240:36.18]No idea, no chance, no hope, no hope.
[240:38.78]I'm not sure, but I'll say false.
[240:42.38]That's not really a valid answer.
[240:44.78]You lose.
[240:49.78]This is an outrage.
[240:51.06]I demand a recount.
[240:52.88]We do have a fabulous consolation prize.
[240:55.88]A copy of Emetics by me, Hugh Bless.
[241:01.12]No thanks.
[241:01.59]I'm content to leave with just my burning shame and newfound sense of inadequacy.
[241:07.05]Okay.
[241:08.57]Find out which poor schmuck will be the next to blow his chance at millions right after these messages.
[241:14.41]Okay, so give me your book.
[241:22.23]I think now's the time to go in.
[241:23.44]Go in from the jungle.
[241:24.72]He just blew his three.
[241:25.86]Go in, go in, go in.
[241:26.48]Go in.
[241:26.66]Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[241:28.04]Good.
[241:28.82]Stun him.
[241:31.40]Nice job, man.
[241:33.32]He's got blue.
[241:33.70]Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[241:40.58]Give me, can I have his?
[241:41.68]Bye.
[241:45.81]Emetics.
[241:46.97]Life troubling your digestion?
[241:49.33]Reality blocking your passages?
[241:52.27]Expel your troubles with Emetics, the handbook for multicolored happiness.
[242:00.34]Already got a copy.
[242:01.76]I read it every morning on the can.
[242:03.60]Multicolored happiness indeed.
[242:05.08]You didn't like that one?
[242:06.80]I thought you guys were going to like that one.
[242:09.73]Okay.
[242:12.75]So I can't... I have... I could probably go back.
[242:19.75]Bye!
[242:19.95]Can I go in here?
[242:23.71]It's polite to knock.
[242:25.19]You do know we're taping a show here.
[242:27.28]Great day in the morning.
[242:28.64]It's Myra Stump herself!
[242:30.64]Yourself.
[242:33.21]Release the hostages.
[242:34.47]Can we come in?
[242:36.01]Are you feeling okay?
[242:37.11]Your eyes look a little spirally.
[242:39.24]Are you feeling alright?
[242:40.66]Of course I am, sweetheart.
[242:42.46]By the way, when was the last time you brushed your teeth?
[242:45.02]And you should really be flossing.
[242:46.82]You certainly sound like your normal self.
[242:49.22]But why are you keeping everybody in there?
[242:51.47]I'm just doing what I always do.
[242:53.37]Slave and toil to put on the best show possible.
[242:56.33]It's just, after opening presents from Wellwishers, I felt so compelled to make this show extra special.
[243:07.64]Fortnite, yes.
[243:08.00]Oh my god, fucking buddy.
[243:09.56]Wait, what is that from?
[243:31.91]How about letting your hostages go now?
[243:33.89]What do you say?
[243:34.87]Hostages?
[243:35.73]They're my guests.
[243:36.95]You know, if there's one that fries my burger, it's the rampant victim culture in American media today.
[243:42.72]Oh, boo-hoo.
[243:44.10]Myra's audience all got luxury minivans.
[243:46.90]Now they have to worry about where they're going to park.
[243:49.32]Bah.
[243:50.36]I know what you mean, Myra.
[243:51.92]It's like I'm always telling people, don't think of it as a bullet wound.
[243:55.71]Think of it as a transfusion opportunity.
[244:01.07]Can we go in?
[244:01.75]Can we come in and see the show?
[244:03.35]Can you?
[244:04.33]Don't you mean... May we come in and see the show?
[244:08.50]That's much better.
[244:10.08]No, we're at full capacity.
[244:12.00]The only people getting in now are famous people who are appearing on the show.
[244:17.18]Can I be guests on your show?
[244:21.06]May we appear as guests on your show?
[244:23.20]I excel at talking about myself!
[244:25.62]Are you famous?
[244:26.84]Perhaps.
[244:27.70]In an internet petition, or there ought to be a law kind of way.
[244:30.98]Not good enough.
[244:32.14]I'll need evidence of your explosive star power.
[244:35.36]I blew up a public restroom last week.
[244:37.61]I want to see a copy of your recording contract for one thing.
[244:40.75]Well, what if we... Recording contract and a clip from your hit TV show.
[244:45.65]You're not anybody these days if you don't act and sing.
[244:48.79]Recording contract, TV clip.
[244:50.59]Got one of them.
[244:51.01]Piece of cake.
[244:52.51]No cake.
[244:53.27]I'm on a diet.
[244:54.19]But I will naturally need evidence of the latest juicy scandal you've been involved in.
[244:58.95]We have to be scandalized?
[245:00.69]Of course.
[245:01.69]What kind of show do you think this is?
[245:04.23]Are you sure you want us to answer that?
[245:06.13]Look, it's very simple.
[245:07.81]Show me a recording contract, a clip from your TV show, and some evidence of a scandal, and I'll squeeze your head.
[245:13.71]Evidence of a scandal.
[245:14.77]Is that all?
[245:15.83]We're almost there.
[245:17.98]As it happens, we brought a clip of our wacky hit sitcom, Midtown Cowboys.
[245:22.20]We're the stars.
[245:23.42]Well, I'm certainly impressed with how far standards for entertainment have fallen in this country.
[245:29.16]Um, thanks.
[245:31.24]But, you're also going to need a recording contract and a nice, juicy scandal.
[245:35.74]Oops.
[245:38.08]Alright, see you later.
[245:38.64]I'm gonna go get my autograph book.
[245:40.46]It's too nice to stay indoors.
[245:42.51]You boys should go play outside.
[245:44.31]And you should stop making that face, dear.
[245:46.69]It'll stick if you're not careful.
[245:48.39]Sam and Max have been around for a long time.
[245:50.31]I just never really thought to care about it.
[245:53.75]I got a scandal.
[245:54.37]I got the picture.
[245:58.09]Really?
[246:00.43]Game show questions.
[246:01.39]Apparently, WARP can't afford armed guards for their game show questions.
[246:06.33]That's cheating, Sam.
[246:07.97]Good thinking.
[246:08.51]Don't get your pretty long ears in a twist, little buddy.
[246:11.19]The answers aren't on here.
[246:12.21]What do you mean they're not on here?
[246:13.41]In life, there are no answers.
[246:15.55]Only questions.
[246:16.99]Another prismatology credo?
[246:19.26]No, I read that in a cereal box.
[246:21.32]I'm seriously deficient in riboflavin, by the way.
[246:23.82]You're seriously deficient, alright.
[246:27.10]So I have to... Game show questions.
[246:31.30]Can I... I can't see how anybody would ever be able to answer any of these questions.
[246:35.30]Can I change the questions?
[246:52.44]We've got another contestant!
[246:53.75]Ah, fuck.
[246:55.03]Oops.
[246:55.57]Oh my, the questions have vanished!
[246:58.55]Welcome back to... Stay in commercial, stay in commercial!
[247:01.86]What?
[247:02.34]He can't just make something up?
[247:06.33]Alright, go in now.
[247:08.79]Go in now.
[247:09.05]Do you have it up?
[247:12.33]Yeah.
[247:20.92]Wait.
[247:21.90]Does that fit?
[247:25.88]Alright.
[247:29.20]Let's do it.
[247:32.09]We've got another contestant.
[247:34.25]I'm just kidding.
[247:35.01]Welcome back.
[247:35.94]Our next contestants are these guys again.
[247:40.50]Okay.
[247:41.20]Are you ready?
[247:47.88]The question is, am I blue?
[247:55.35]Um...
[248:11.46]I don't think so.
[248:11.96]No, Hugh.
[248:12.54]You're not blue.
[248:14.46]Oh, dear.
[248:15.42]Oh, me.
[248:15.82]Oh, my.
[248:18.34]That's absolutely right.
[248:23.71]Yes.
[248:25.13]Congratulations.
[248:27.09]You're a millionaire.
[248:32.83]I don't know if the game may have thrown a curveball at me and it's like he's sad.
[248:35.67]He's so happy.
[248:37.21]Look at how happy he is.
[248:39.40]It's not.
[248:39.98]One.
[248:40.20]Two.
[249:02.88]3 174 175 999 999 and a million let's go spend it sam it's burning a hole in my pocket it's putting quite a bulge in mine

[249:42.58]What?
[249:42.78]I'm making an irony.
[249:47.27]I don't know what that is.
[249:53.39]Okay, so now I can go get the thing.
[249:56.78]Let's go back.
[250:02.09]I'm glad you're making fun of chat for that.
[250:04.82]No, I mean, I just, I know what's gonna happen, okay?
[250:09.42]I've been around a long time.
[250:11.06]I know what you guys are going to do.
[250:19.68]Make a cake, I already did.
[250:25.31]Oh, he's calling, oh, calling out chat.
[250:28.09]He's calling out chat.
[250:34.96]We're so predictable.
[250:39.75]What a toxic environment.
[250:43.07]Streamers making fun of chat.
[250:45.45]I'm not making fun of chat.
[250:47.20]I'm taking the piss, mate.

[251:31.75]Blimey!
[251:32.89]Food stamps.
[251:34.37]I suppose I must accept them.
[251:37.13]Oh, the Danish government conspiracy.
[251:40.63]It's hogwash.
[251:41.69]Complete codswallop.
[251:44.49]Codswallop.
[251:46.23]Here, then, is your chemical-based voice modulator.
[251:49.76]This is a helium balloon strapped to an inhaler.
[251:52.64]But it works.
[251:53.48]Trust me, trust me.
[251:57.63]Holy chipmunk, Ari is warbling out of a souped up 78 speed turntable.
[252:01.33]It works.
[252:03.11]Thanks, Bosco.
[252:06.58]Can you guys fucking believe that they made an entire franchise?
[252:08.94]An entire four, three, four decade long franchise around people singing like that and then pitch shifting up to be chipmunks?
[252:36.31]And they brought it back too, and it was still as popular.
[252:42.73]It hurts to listen to that.
[252:48.55]It's like, my fucking god, I can only take it for ten seconds.
[252:50.99]They made four movies.
[252:56.10]High pitch shifted loud singing?
[253:03.38]That had to have been some...
[253:06.22]Crack Tug Studio Executive.
[253:08.12]Goodie!
[253:09.40]I thought it was funny.
[253:10.26]Alright, so let's try this again.
[253:31.33]Cocained out.
[253:33.11]So is he still... Is he my friend?
[253:34.81]Do I have to do this again?
[253:36.25]Because I said happy birthday and gave him the cake.
[253:47.22]He should vote for me now, right?
[253:48.34]Alright, let's do the balloon.
[253:54.53]Testing.
[253:55.55]One, two, three.
[254:00.98]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our next contestant, Sam.
[254:07.49]Hello.
[254:08.31]I'd like to do a little song I call... It doesn't matter what it is.
[254:13.79]Bottleneck on the freeway of doom.
[254:15.99]May the starfish justice not infuse.
[254:28.65]Thinking about the rings on the Great Raccoon All the girlies hear me and they slew They made vinyls?
[254:42.40]And let's hear from our judges!
[254:45.50]Your moribund crooning is far less offensive than Peeper's excruciating slaughterhouse squalor.
[254:51.42]Well, let's put it this way.
[254:54.42]How many of you guys would like to listen to all the Yoshis sing Barbie Girl?
[255:02.44]I don't think you do.
[255:04.68]Oh, fucking please.
[255:06.76]What do I have to put tomatoes in?
[255:09.54]I need to get a tomato.
[255:31.65]He said no tomatoes.
[255:32.55]No, didn't he say I want you missing tomatoes?
[255:41.50]Put shit in it.
[255:42.40]No, I can't do that.
[255:43.24]Alright, is there any tomatoes?
[255:49.82]Tomatoes.
[255:50.52]Tomatoes?
[255:51.04]Tomatoes.
[255:54.31]I gotta pee.
[255:59.23]Alright, I gotta pee.
[255:59.73]I'll be right back.
[259:01.44]Good evening.
[259:04.76]I've returned.
[259:10.73]Can you wait a bit longer?
[259:12.09]I gotta pee now, I'll be quick.
[259:13.45]Hurry up, let's go.
[259:14.79]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[259:23.93]Gotta do this real quick, bring it back.
[259:26.81]Welcome once again to Cooking Without Ian's What Food Po- What are we making there?
[259:32.83]Well, click!
[259:35.55]I'm not going, I'm waiting, I'm gonna wait for... I didn't even click, I clicked back into the window and it clicked in the game.
[259:43.37]I'm not gonna, I'm gonna wait.
[259:56.55]That's good.
[259:58.19]You're already back?
[259:58.99]Did you pee into the air?
[260:01.56]What?
[260:01.88]Did you just, like, go?
[260:05.60]That was down in five to ten seconds!
[260:15.28]Alright, let's get going.
[260:18.11]So I've gotta come up with, um... What do I need to come up with here?
[260:27.33]What was I doing?
[260:28.61]Right, I gotta go back.
[260:29.23]Okay, go back and get my Scandal.
[260:31.88]And then I've got to do something with the game show questions.
[260:33.76]Is there any tomatoes?
[260:38.22]Are there any tomatoes in this room?
[260:47.61]What about the cooler?
[260:48.29]What about the oven?
[260:58.37]This is quite realistic.
[261:00.10]Like that animatronic kid on the Cosby show!
[261:05.62]Come in the window.
[261:06.72]It's like a scene from Heidi.
[261:08.82]How does that fr- No, no, no, no, it's wrong!
[261:15.93]Well, I'm gonna- let me go do the scandal.
[261:19.33]Let me just get that out of the way, let's exit.
[261:31.78]Oh, and also, I gotta change the... to part two.
[261:35.94]I gotta save it.
[261:36.66]This has been, like, fucking two hours here.
[261:41.03]That would have been a blunder.
[261:42.47]Alright, let me, uh, change the title.
[261:46.33]Well, not this one.
[261:47.03]Just chilling with the dog and the hair is fine.
[261:49.45]This is episode two, though.
[261:53.63]Called Situation Comedy.
[261:55.09]There it is.
[261:56.29]So we don't give people the wrong idea.
[262:03.94]Alright.
[262:12.52]Let's go back and give the photo.
[262:17.43]Wait.
[262:17.77]No, I went that way.
[262:18.55]No, this is the right way.
[262:20.53]Exit's right back here, right?
[262:29.50]Are you allowed just to set it to Sam and Max?
[262:32.49]Um, I think so, but if you're in the directory and it's there, you know, people will be able to see it.
[262:40.88]Oh, he's on episode two!
[262:41.76]Let's go to the scanner.
[262:55.90]Who will that help?
[262:56.62]I don't know.
[262:58.89]The random person that maybe sees Sam and Max in the directory and they go, oh, Sam and Max.
[263:03.91]What episode?
[263:04.77]Episode two?
[263:05.13]Ah, there it is.
[263:06.75]Why is there even a directory in the first place?
[263:16.22]Sam, this is perfect.
[263:17.70]This photo is a capstone.
[263:19.70]It succinctly summarizes over 30 years of extraterrestrial related photographic evidence.
[263:25.66]Siri.
[263:25.76]There it is.
[263:26.04]Do I get a copy of it?
[263:26.82]Or do I have to go newsstand?
[263:28.56]Alright, so, I... Let's leave.
[263:56.56]So we need to get to a newsstand.
[263:57.88]Is it in Bosco's?
[264:19.57]No news?
[264:20.04]Oh, here we go.
[264:25.22]We are famous.
[264:27.49]Cool.
[264:39.62]I speedrun Sam and Max professionally.
[264:41.26]Don't miscategorize them in the directory.
[264:43.68]Is it wrong?
[264:45.36]No, it's not.
[264:46.40]This is Episode 2 Situation Comedy.
[264:49.02]I got it right.
[264:49.48]Alright, do you got... Do you have tomatoes in here?
[264:59.56]Ketchup, mustard, and purple stuff.
[265:03.28]As vaguely referred to on TV.
[265:06.74]Give me the ketchup.
[265:16.87]Oh, I need to put it on the cake.
[265:18.67]Well, shit.
[265:27.19]Cake, cake, cake, cake.
[265:32.77]Backtracking.
[265:33.79]Back and forth.
[265:35.75]Point-and-click adventure games.
[265:43.09]Unoptimal speedrun.
[265:44.23]Yeah, unoptimal route.
[265:45.99]I'm just gonna reset.
[265:46.59]Goodie!
[266:00.82]The Jupiter in the chat.
[266:17.11]This chat is now in Kenshi-only mode.
[266:25.87]What are you talking about?
[266:34.95]What?
[266:35.41]Oh, the frog.
[266:38.85]I forgot.
[266:39.39]I love these little pineapple juice cans.
[266:48.64]They're so good.
[266:50.20]I love those little juice cans.
[266:56.63]welcome once again to cooking without looking the show where we use absolutely nians whatsoever and food poison chuck thank you and welcome to the show what are we making this time food poison a cake today we're baking a cake and we're gonna use max it doesn't matter asbestos of course who could forget the asbestos sprinkles this stuff isn't just for school lunches real kitchens use it too
[267:26.39]And, uh, tweed.
[267:27.67]Of course, it wouldn't be real bachelor cooking without tweed.
[267:31.45]Bachelors, here's a tip.
[267:33.29]Tweed isn't just for cooking.
[267:35.19]It also makes a great toupee.
[267:37.81]And MSG.
[267:38.15]Every chef has a signature ingredient that no one has ever heard of or used.
[267:42.99]Mine's MSG.
[267:44.75]If you put it enough that you feel a burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms, and chest, you're just about there.
[267:52.71]Make sure to include red dye number two.
[267:55.92]Get it in there.
[267:56.40]Put ketchup on it, come back, and let's go.
[267:58.52]Isn't MSG not even that bad for you?
[268:01.34]Um... I don't know.
[268:01.88]Isn't that one of those things?
[268:03.70]I think we talked about this before.
[268:31.77]MSG can like... Didn't MSG cause headaches in one person?
[268:51.29]MSG makes you retain crazy water.
[268:56.45]Yeah, the thing about MSG, wasn't there a one-guy scenario?
[269:00.75]Where somebody said, MSG gave me a headache and made me sick and stuff, and they did a whole thing on it?
[269:19.78]Hello?
[269:23.06]I mean, the moral of the story is don't use too much salt or any additive on anything.
[269:34.14]A little ketchup is always good on a cake.
[269:38.77]Don't put too much salt, too much sugar.
[269:40.87]Bring your body down towards more natural approach.
[269:49.19]Moral of the story, just lower your intake of salt and sodium.
[269:54.29]Don't eat too much cheese.
[269:55.71]You can eat a bunch of it.
[269:56.71]Eat a fucking ton of it.
[269:57.73]Don't eat too much of it.
[270:01.77]Make sure you're thoroughly cooking your food.
[270:08.29]Where are we going, Sam?
[270:11.17]The TV studio.
[270:12.69]Goody!
[270:19.41]Paleo?
[270:19.99]No, eat like a fucking hamburger.
[270:21.32]Go to McDonald's, go to the drive-thru right now and get like two Big Macs.
[270:23.68]Do it now.
[270:24.70]Do it right now.
[270:25.48]If you can.
[270:26.38]If you're able to.
[270:26.82]If you're hungry, get it.
[270:30.46]But don't eat it every day.
[270:40.18]Happy birthday.
[270:42.02]Oh boy!
[270:43.56]Birthday cake!
[270:45.78]That red frosting looks tasty!
[270:50.77]MSG, yeah, it's monosodium glutamate.
[270:52.69]If you're sensitive to a gluten-based product, then don't do it.
[270:57.05]Don't eat it.
[270:57.37]That was really... Oh, really... Uh-oh.
[271:03.82]Time out for number two!
[271:08.82]What the darn it?
[271:09.96]He better not be going to see Myra.
[271:12.02]Well, anyway, we can't wait.
[271:13.52]We'll just have to finish the show with only two judges.
[271:15.54]Whatever you guys agree on goes.
[271:17.55]Vote for me!
[271:21.55]Yeah, if you're, like, able, you know, your sound body and sound mind, go grab a kickback or something.
[271:30.48]It's up to you.
[271:40.26]No, don't do too much of that.
[271:42.28]He's getting, uh-oh, he's getting, like, addicted to it.
[271:48.35]That's not good.
[271:49.09]I don't want to do that again.
[271:51.66]I'd like to do a little song I call... Busted Down Hound Dog Blues.
[272:03.29]Shiny like a new mylar balloon.
[272:10.82]Thinking about the rings on the great raccoon.
[272:19.31]And so I wrote this extremely catchy tune.
[272:24.73]Okay.
[272:25.09]And let's hear from our judges.
[272:28.19]Bravo.
[272:29.05]Your wobbly tenor is way better than Peepers' real squawky.
[272:31.35]You chose the same one each time.
[272:32.77]I don't know.
[272:33.39]You really nailed that high note.
[272:35.90]And you're less sloppy than my brother is.
[272:38.50]You got my vote.
[272:40.42]Hey!
[272:42.42]All of the remaining judges have agreed.
[272:44.44]We have a winner.
[272:48.20]Congratulations, Sam.
[272:49.32]Here's your recorded contract.
[272:52.15]Got it.
[272:53.27]It's like a dream come true.
[272:55.27]Specs, I'll get you for this if it's the last thing I do.
[273:00.05]Right after I get back from Mount Rushmore.
[273:02.67]Rushmore?
[273:03.75]I'd better go after him.
[273:05.29]I just remembered.
[273:06.21]I have to feed my goldfish.
[273:07.81]Are we still taping?
[273:09.33]Be sure to join us next time on Embarrassing Idol.
[273:16.43]I could probably get to the first round.
[273:20.94]I'm dead serious.
[273:23.56]I could definitely, if I waited in line for 16 hours for American Idol, I could probably get through the first round.
[273:32.74]It would be a debate, you know, between Paula and Simon.
[273:38.20]Paula would vote for me and Simon would vote for me too.
[273:43.51]I would just go in there and just, I would just fucking give my all.
[273:46.17]And I would give him a crazy story.
[273:47.85]I'd go in there with a guitar wrapped around my neck.
[273:49.13]I wouldn't even play it.
[274:05.24]I think I could do it, though.
[274:06.38]I really do.
[274:08.40]Get past that first round.
[274:18.38]Just go in there and play Minecraft VR.
[274:21.00]Okay, what do I got everything?
[274:25.41]Recording contract.
[274:28.61]Love triangle.
[274:30.69]The game show?
[274:31.39]These... Why do I still have these?
[274:32.90]Well... Uh...
[274:47.72]How do we do?
[274:48.24]I have it.
[274:50.38]What if we have video games?
[274:52.56]Those things will ruin your eyes.
[274:54.20]They're awful.
[274:56.38]Recording contract.
[274:56.94]We do have a recording contract.
[274:58.88]In bottom records.
[275:00.02]Take a look.
[275:00.82]You should have us on as guests.
[275:03.04]What would I even sing?
[275:03.54]Something classic.
[275:04.22]Something easy.
[275:04.80]Some timeless that everybody knows.
[275:06.23]And don't forget to watch Behind Your Ears first.
[275:20.44]Actually, we graced the cover of the current edition of the Alien Love Triangle Times.
[275:24.96]How's that for a scandal?
[275:26.66]You will have us on your show now, yes?
[275:28.80]Oh, I suppose so.
[275:30.42]If only so I can talk about America's lamentably endless fascination with depravity.
[275:35.01]Stop skipping.
[275:36.17]I'm just, my pan naturally expects to be on the right side and be on my, and I hit right, click.
[275:42.19]My finger goes there.
[275:43.61]And use your indoor voice.
[275:48.22]what about while you're on my show you stay in your seats at all times you do not interrupt me when I'm talking and you treat the audience with the utmost respect even if you become less sure with each passing year that they deserve it now I'll call you on stage in a minute gosh max celebrity is just a never-ending set of arbitrary goals one accomplishes to appease a dismissive and distracted if not entirely absent authority figure
[276:13.93]I don't know if I agree, Sam, but I've begun my decadent slide into a depraved personal hell just in case.
[276:21.95]Okay.
[276:27.27]Give her a hand, everyone.
[276:28.67]Betsy Bovine reading from her new book, The Heart Has Four Summits, Ruminations on a Life in Hollywood, out now in all major bookstores.
[276:38.27]This microphone is starting to spark from overuse, but that doesn't mean we're ready to pack it in.
[276:43.74]We've got the stars of the not-quite-cancelled sitcom Midtown Cowboys, who also happen to be the winner and judge of TV's Embarrassing Idol.
[276:52.92]Ladies and gentlemen, Sam and Matt.
[277:01.62]Hold the hayride, little pal.
[277:03.56]That bear seems more than slightly hinky, in the mesmeric sense of the term.
[277:08.23]Shadier than a fat man's ankles.
[277:10.34]Let's take it down like ducks in a gutter.
[277:15.99]Hold it!
[277:17.15]My guest sit at that end.
[277:18.71]But that bear has got you.
[277:20.06]Sit.
[277:20.90]We'll just sit where you want us to, ma'am.
[277:23.28]Lovely.
[277:24.50]What gives, Sam?
[277:25.74]Why can't we just grab the bear?
[277:27.46]It would appear that the laws of physics are different on the set of a talk show, little buddy.
[277:32.62]You're gonna have to play along.
[277:33.96]Sit.
[277:34.38]Sam and Max, you're talented, hot new celebrities who've taken the entertainment world by storm.
[277:39.08]So naturally, we all want to hear everything about your involvement in the scandal detailed in the Alien Love Triangle Times.
[277:47.00]Uh... I'd rather talk about midtown cowboys.
[277:50.27]I'd rather leave my embarrassing... How about that picture in the Times?
[277:53.87]Okay.
[277:54.61]There's something you should know about that picture in the Times.
[277:57.69]I'm not sure I want to know anything more.
[277:59.91]Maybe you think Hollywood thinks it's funny to flaunt your polyplanetary pickups, but the rest of us find alien love triangles, frankly, disgusting.
[278:08.12]But the photo is not quite what it seems.
[278:11.22]How so?
[278:18.37]It's not us.
[278:20.05]We just used it to get on here.
[278:22.35]That's no alien.
[278:23.27]It's Hugh Bliss.
[278:25.29]There was someone else involved.
[278:32.33]It's not a picture of an alien at all.
[278:34.27]That's Hugh Bliss.
[278:35.71]Hugh Bliss?
[278:36.69]The highly respected founder of prismatology?
[278:39.70]Don't be ridiculous.
[278:41.16]Why, I've had him on my show before, and he certainly isn't green.
[278:44.54]What are you really hiding?
[278:48.85]How much I'm scared of being buffeted by another gust of Hurricane Myra?
[278:52.77]Flattery will get you nowhere, mister.
[278:54.92]I don't know about you, audience, but as a girl, I was taught that flattery was the worst possible way to blah, blah, blah, yak, yak, yak.
[279:02.77]I was gonna shoot the bear.
[279:04.69]You can hear her laugh.
[279:06.07]Did you hear that?
[279:07.07]She was breaking into the studio.
[279:33.69]Listen.
[279:48.00]Ah yes, where were we?
[279:48.96]I think we were discussing the alien love triangle times and that nasty scandalous affair of yours.
[280:22.50]I'd like to sing if I may.
[280:25.48]Is that wise?
[280:26.26]Howling at that drippy old honka moo.
[280:32.59]Broke it.
[280:33.33]Whoa.
[280:33.95]No, I didn't break the bear?
[280:35.63]That was wonderful.
[280:37.01]I'm so moved, I almost don't have a long-hectaring screed in me.
[280:40.39]Oh, no, wait.
[280:41.34]There it is.
[280:42.18]My goodness.
[280:43.42]Self-referential songwriting is a dangerously blah, blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack.
[280:47.92]No, no, no.
[280:49.44]Blah, blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack, yack.
[280:52.24]Puddle.
[280:52.52]I think it's getting the bear away.
[280:53.70]Yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety, yack, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[280:59.39]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[281:00.85]Yak, yak, yak, yak.
[281:02.22]Bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody.
[281:03.66]Yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yak.
[281:06.46]Blah, blah, blah.
[281:07.89]Blah, blah.
[281:09.52]Okay, I have to move the microphone.
[281:11.78]He's gonna die.
[281:13.20]Fuck, you're getting my hand off the thing.
[281:34.00]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[281:35.48]Yak, yak, yak, yak.
[281:36.84]Bloddy, bloddy, bloddy, bloddy.
[281:38.31]Yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety.
[281:40.47]Why can't we sit over there?
[281:42.35]You'll sit where you are and like it, mister.
[281:45.41]Yes, ma'am.
[281:46.33]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[281:47.79]Yak, yak, yak, yak.
[281:49.16]Bloddy, bloddy, bloddy, bloddy.
[281:50.62]Yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yakety, yak.
[281:53.38]Blah, blah, blah.
[281:54.78]Blah, blah.
[281:56.55]I have to get him.
[282:27.10]ah yes where were we I think we were discussing the alien love triangle times in that nasty scandalous affair of you okay uh I'd rather talk about that bear I'd like to talk about that charming yet mildly insidious looking bear on your desk can I see it I don't know sam can you
[282:47.94]May I see it, please?
[282:50.02]No, you may not.
[282:51.04]And if I may say so, if there's one thing that grills my chicken, it's how our culture is in a state of modal decay.
[282:57.08]Can is not the same as may.
[282:58.86]Should is not the same as blah, blah, blah.
[283:00.95]Yackety, yackety, yackety, yackety.
[283:02.53]Hopefully she'll be off on her tri-state nagging spree for a while.
[283:07.31]Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[283:08.75]Yack, yack, yack, yack.
[283:10.13]Bloddy, bloddy, bloddy, bloddy.
[283:11.57]Yackety, yackety, yack.
[283:14.15]Ah, yes.
[283:15.03]Where were we?
[283:15.77]Scandal...
[283:20.14]I'd rather talk about our smash-hit sitcom, Midtown Cowboys.
[283:23.69]Okay, let's talk.
[283:24.93]You two have become the new breakout stars of a flaccid, dissolute sitcom in its final days.
[283:30.29]How wonderful for you.
[283:32.53]Thanks.
[283:32.95]We brought a clip.
[283:34.27]You certainly did.
[283:35.59]I had a chance to watch it, and I refused to show it to my audience.
[283:39.86]Why?
[283:40.18]It has a shocking joke involving a cow pie.
[283:43.74]It's a sad commentary on today's culture when the cow pie, once a staple of the American diet, blah blah blah blah yak yak yak yak.
[283:52.49]I see why Myra only lets big stars on her show.
[283:55.41]They're easier targets?
[283:56.83]If you're big enough, there still might be something left when she's finished.
[284:00.43]Blah blah blah blah yak yak yak yak bloody blah.
[284:05.41]Ah, yes.
[284:05.69]Scandalous.
[284:11.19]I like to talk about me.
[284:12.21]I like to talk about- What's with you and the alien- Okay, she so badly wants to talk about the alien love triangle, and when I bring it up she says nobody wants to hear about it.
[284:22.51]That's what she said.
[284:37.92]I'd like to mention my pal Sam and something that happened the other day.
[284:41.38]Anecdotes about other celebrities, even ones as dubious as you two, are always welcome.
[284:47.27]Well, I was battering this person at you with a broken parking meter and screaming, die!
[284:51.73]Why won't you die?
[284:52.93]And Sam said, you crack me up, little buddy.
[284:55.81]The point being, I crack Sam up.
[284:59.31]Are you sure you wouldn't rather talk about your alien love triangle shenanigans?
[285:02.95]Jesus Christ.
[285:09.32]There's more you should know about that picture in the Times.
[285:12.34]What's that?
[285:16.31]It doesn't tell the whole story.
[285:17.77]There's someone else involved.
[285:19.27]Someone the picture doesn't show.
[285:23.47]How shocking.
[285:24.93]Who?
[285:35.60]Bessie the cow?
[285:38.00]One of the paupers?
[285:40.15]I don't know who this is.
[285:47.71]One of the soda poppers.
[285:51.55]Oh my!
[285:52.73]Which one?
[285:54.57]Peepers?
[285:55.73]Peepers.
[286:01.25]Peepers is the one... Peepers is like the weird one, right?
[286:06.06]Peepers.
[286:08.29]Peepers is backstage.
[286:11.04]Here we go.
[286:11.82]This is where you hear a bunch of fucking swears.
[286:13.84]Censored.
[286:14.90]I knew it.
[286:15.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[286:38.89]She just put the mic over here.
[286:40.37]What about the puddle?
[286:41.59]I think it's getting the bear wet.
[286:44.09]She just put the microphone in the puddle.
[286:49.80]Ah, yes.
[286:50.26]Scandalous.
[286:52.34]Wouldn't the microphone get shocked in the puddle?
[286:59.18]There's more.
[287:02.25]There are still... Incredible.
[287:07.53]bessie bovine our co-star on midtown cowboys oh my audience shall we bring her back out again alright what why did it happen that should have happened already right obvious comment that was shocking is she breathing a little
[287:29.98]But the creepy teddy bear was toast.
[287:32.50]Nuts.
[287:33.14]I wanted to ask it a few questions.
[287:34.93]And maybe use it to hypnotize Katie Couric.
[287:37.19]Another glorious dream bangs its chin on the dirty pavement.
[287:41.62]On the bright side, the audience is free to go home.
[287:45.82]Aw, I was just getting warmed up.
[287:47.66]You think Myra will have us back on the show again soon?
[287:50.24]Um, speaking of unlikely, did you notice we just had two cases in a row involving hypnotic mind control?
[287:55.92]Complete coincidence?
[287:57.92]Yes, I think so.
[287:59.34]The cogs of the universe synchronize in ways we're not meant to see.
[288:03.14]Speaking of things we're not meant to see, there's a new restaurant at the zoo where you can eat what they feed the animals.
[288:08.42]Empty popcorn cartons and cigarette butts?
[288:10.98]And processed bread logs loaded with tranquilizers and antidepressants.
[288:14.45]Yeah, she's dead.
[288:15.08]Episode 2!
[288:15.32]Situation Comedy.
[288:16.54]That was fun.
[288:43.02]New World Record speedrun.
[288:49.13]Episode 3?
[288:50.33]Nah, I can't.
[288:51.67]We can't do episode 3 tonight.
[288:56.81]It's gonna... It's mid... It's almost midnight.
[288:59.27]I'm not... The stream's not over.
[289:01.63]But... I don't know if another two... They're about two and a half hours each.
[289:12.14]So that would be like 2 to 3.
[289:14.14]That'd be like almost 3 a.m.
[289:15.34]Pacific.
[289:28.66]They get better as it goes on.
[289:29.68]Do you think it'll continue?
[289:30.52]Yeah, definitely.
[289:33.70]I might even just come back with this.
[289:35.58]We'll just keep doing it.
[289:36.32]We'll get through at least season one.
[289:48.74]Episode 3 is actually an hour shorter.
[289:51.18]That's no... That's not a joke.
[289:55.28]Really?
[289:56.62]What do you mean?
[290:02.92]Am I falling for it?
[290:03.70]Is that for real?

[290:48.87]Let's take a look.
[290:49.65]How long?
[291:01.05]Kind of hard to search for these.

[292:13.87]Alright, let's do it.

[294:23.90]Let's just see what happens.
[294:38.13]Was it actually 5 o'clock in the morning?
[294:48.02]Yeah, but that was a true super investment.
[294:52.67]Because I wasn't going to turn that shit back on ever again.
[294:57.53]Something like this, it's episodes and I can go back and forth and I can do it, I can do a season!
[295:03.44]Then come back like in a week or two, do the other season or something, right?
[295:06.77]That's not, Seaman was, I was never going to put the disc back in that tray ever again.
[295:14.93]I have to wait until this gets to the menu.
[295:18.54]I cannot skip it.
[295:19.66]I have to wait until it gets to the menu and then exit and redo it.
[295:32.75]Okay.
[295:33.63]This is called the Moldemob and the Meatball.
[295:35.49]I can't get to the menu until I get in the game, so just give me a second.
[295:55.21]Alright, come on.
[295:55.73]This is a long intro.
[295:56.45]Let's go.
[296:02.37]put it to 1280 by 960 graphics on full screen off alright apply that okay you should be able to hear it now there you go alright new game

[296:33.39]Just make sure it is.
[296:34.11]Alright, late night, late night, late night.
[296:44.39]Going late tonight.
[296:46.77]Game time.
[296:53.47]I remember game time.
[297:06.14]Okay, we'll see where we are.
[297:22.31]After about 45 minutes of playing an hour or so, we'll see if we're getting to the end of the episode.
[297:29.83]If we're not, you know, and there's like an hour or two to go, we can just save it and come back.
[297:36.34]It's not a big deal.
[297:38.80]Because I don't want this to be like a 3-4 AM stretch.
[297:44.72]I think I just gave birth to a bouncing baby hernia.
[297:47.48]I got it, I got it!
[297:54.24]Hello?
[297:55.08]Yes, Commissioner?
[297:56.36]Holy cap, we're in Catfish, blabbing a crime beat.
[297:58.69]We're on our way.
[298:00.93]Did he get the notes I sent him?
[298:02.41]Yes, but he said to stop carving them into the suspects.
[298:05.10]He can't read them without his bifocals.
[298:07.26]what if I just write bigger forget that max we're after the most infamous organized crime outfit in the city the toy mafia the cutthroat killers with no respect for human life but an odd predilection for delightful children's toys the same I love those guys commissioner has reason to believe that the toy mafia's secret headquarters are located in the one place no one would ever suspect teddy bear's mafia free playland and casino
[298:33.58]The sallowest place on Earth?
[298:35.64]Oh, boy.
[298:36.84]Well, it's not going to be all laps and dispersal, little chum.
[298:39.72]It's a rescue op.
[298:40.96]The commissioner sent an undercover mole to investigate if he hasn't reported in weeks.
[298:45.29]Our job is to make contact with the mole and see if he needs help.
[298:49.09]Is he a large star-shaped mole or more of a beauty mark?
[298:52.67]No idea, Max.
[298:53.83]To find him, we're supposed to give the code phrase, does the carpet match the drapes?
[298:59.80]Somebody said, hey, let me guess, the undercover mole is actually a mole.
[299:13.57]It's a little loud.
[299:18.53]You would probably be right.
[299:20.25]You would... Yeah, you are, you're right.
[299:22.49]It's definitely gonna be that.
[299:24.70]Or they'll do the complete 180 and it'll be like a gorilla or something.
[299:42.13]To infiltrate the casino.
[299:55.08]The casino!
[299:55.80]Alright, Bosco still exists.
[299:59.14]That's right, I forgot.
[300:13.92]He didn't hesitate for a second.
[300:15.20]He saw the word casino.
[300:16.08]Welcome to Teddy Bear's Mafia Free Playland and Casino.
[300:20.90]That face.
[300:22.50]My name's Lovey Bear.
[300:24.90]Boy, do we have some fun and games for you.
[300:28.82]Here, take this token amount of tokens as our way of saying welcome and go spend a lot of money.
[300:36.84]It's the bear from the last episode.
[300:43.32]Good thing we had a good report card.
[300:44.48]Is there a mole in here?
[300:46.39]I hear you have a mole problem.
[300:48.51]Hey, it's a genetic condition.
[300:50.67]You should have seen my father's back.
[300:53.35]Holy cow, I'm actually being too subtle.
[300:56.24]First time that's ever happened.
[300:58.04]Maybe I should just stick to the code phrase.
[301:04.01]Holy domesticated persons, Max.
[301:06.15]Lovey Bear here's got the same head as that hypnotic teddy bear from Myra's talk show.
[301:10.23]You think that little talk show bear had a litter of giant babies?
[301:14.91]I don't know, Max.
[301:16.11]Call it canine intuition, but I think our mole discovered something about these teddy bears he shouldn't have.
[301:22.55]We've got to find him and get to the bottom of this.
[301:25.70]You're lucky this mask doesn't have ear holes, or I might have heard that secret conversation you just had right in front of me.
[301:32.63]What?
[301:33.74]Sorry, I wasn't listening.
[301:37.52]Do we say the thing?
[301:39.70]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[301:41.88]If Don Teddy Bear says so, they do.
[301:45.66]Don Teddy Bear?
[301:47.02]I thought this place was mafia-free.
[301:48.98]That's right, kiddies.
[301:50.30]100% mafia-free.
[301:52.66]No mafia anywheres.
[301:54.72]Come on, true.
[301:59.45]You give tokens to first-time customers?
[302:01.91]That's right.
[302:02.87]Go on, enjoy.
[302:04.45]Live a little.
[302:06.00]It just seems like bad business sense.
[302:08.34]The guy behind you had a crazed face.
[302:11.40]When you're trying to pawn your little friend here to pay off the vig, we can talk then about bad business sense.
[302:18.36]Okay, we'll come back then.
[302:21.76]We're looking for somebody who works here.
[302:23.72]Look, I just greet the guests.
[302:25.86]You want to know who works here?
[302:27.21]Don Ted Ebert.
[302:27.95]He's in charge.
[302:31.29]Where's the Don?
[302:32.60]He's got, uh, business in the back room.
[302:36.52]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[302:37.80]What kind of business?
[302:39.42]Yeah, the kind of business that gets said like it's got quote marks around it, so's you know not to ask.
[302:47.76]Alright.
[302:48.70]Thanks, Levy Bear.
[302:49.78]Enjoy, and remember, if you're not losing, we're not winning.
[302:57.93]Whack da rats.
[302:59.87]Whack da rats rules.
[303:02.86]They get to make all the rules, so what are you talking about?
[303:07.08]He actually gets to play blackjack?
[303:13.36]Back room guard.
[303:14.83]What else is in here?
[303:15.85]Buffet is closed.
[303:18.99]Buffet closed for semi-annual food change.
[303:21.75]Sorry, Max.
[303:24.85]Semi-annual food change.
[303:28.38]One-armed bandit slot machine.
[303:30.00]Can I just pull it?
[303:33.26]I don't have any money.
[303:34.56]Oh, I have to... I have to have free money.
[303:43.20]I did it.
[303:44.24]Yeah, we won, but there's no prize.
[303:47.92]You gotta hand it to Teddy Bear.
[303:49.78]He really puts the bandit in one-armed bandit.
[303:52.88]Hold it.
[303:53.48]What's the password?
[303:55.20]It's a seven.
[304:00.99]Why is there no money?
[304:01.65]That doesn't make any sense.
[304:03.13]What?
[304:04.51]How do you have a casino when it doesn't pay out anything?
[304:11.69]Disturbing bear heads.
[304:12.61]That's terrifying.
[304:30.12]These rats are gonna pop up, see?
[304:32.06]If the rat's keeping his mouth shut, you don't touch him.
[304:34.54]But if that rat's singing, you put a bullet in his head.
[304:38.01]Jesus Christ.
[304:38.47]I was on this trial and I win a souvenir magnet.
[304:43.71]Look, Max, it's a beloved carnival game with a delightful mobster twist.
[304:48.13]What better way to relax than by offing fake rodents in the most violent way imaginable?
[304:53.07]Note, please supply your own firearm.
[304:55.76]We always do.
[304:57.26]Insert token to play.
[305:00.52]Alright, we'll put one in.
[305:06.86]I can't put a token in?
[305:09.60]I used my only token!
[305:10.80]Hold on, what about these guys?
[305:18.39]Who are we playing?
[305:29.98]The name's Steak Charmer.
[305:31.66]Leonard Steak Charmer.
[305:33.34]And let's just say I didn't rack up 10 million tokens by getting lucky.
[305:38.19]How'd you get him then?
[305:39.35]By cheating.
[305:40.83]Look, Rabbit, Leonard Steak Charmer's no cheat.
[305:43.77]He's just that good.
[305:45.13]What's the game?
[305:45.71]Okay, what's the game, Steak Charmer?
[305:47.52]Blackjack, poker, back around.
[305:50.30]Indian poker.
[305:54.10]How exactly does one play poker at the Indian Persuasion?
[305:57.81]You know you're off to a good start when your opponent doesn't even know how to play.
[306:01.82]You ever consider that we might be card sharks?
[306:04.84]Or shark sharks?
[306:06.24]You know, the kind that eat people for being overconfident?
[306:09.40]Whatever.
[306:10.08]Look, it's simple.
[306:11.24]We both get dealt a card which we put on our forehead without looking at it.
[306:15.30]So we can see each other's card, but not our own.
[306:17.96]I need to guess if your denomination's higher than theirs.
[306:22.00]Oh, yours is, yeah.
[306:22.70]That's it?
[306:26.96]Let's play.
[306:27.72]We have guns too, so...
[306:56.84]Am I higher or lower?
[306:59.44]Probably lower.
[307:02.78]Is he looking at the card?
[307:04.06]I got 10 million tokens says I got a better card than you.
[307:07.27]I'm betting it all.
[307:08.73]Sweet second mortgages on a summer home.
[307:10.93]We can't match that.
[307:12.73]Tell you what, pooch.
[307:14.13]I'm feeling so confident.
[307:15.61]I'll give you 10 million to one odds.
[307:18.01]Just bet one token and you can win the whole pot.
[307:21.30]Those are mighty good odds.
[307:23.20]No, they ain't, deputy dog.
[307:25.26]Because I never lose.
[307:26.24]Million to one.
[307:27.24]You bet one token on that?
[307:28.66]That's so dumb.
[307:31.50]Let's bet.
[307:32.28]Sure.
[307:32.62]We'll bet a token.
[307:34.50]Sorry.
[307:34.97]I didn't see the card.
[307:35.75]Wait, I just saw the card.
[307:37.69]Stick Chama wins.
[307:39.47]Mama was wrong.
[307:40.11]What was the card?
[307:40.67]Gambling does pay.
[307:42.44]I'd say better luck next time, but it'll take more than luck to beat me.
[307:46.81]Yeah, to take a sturdy oaken staff to really do the job.
[307:51.45]What was my card?
[308:02.35]Deal.
[308:03.49]Alright.
[308:11.67]You get a four.
[308:12.39]My card is definitely way higher than yours.
[308:17.63]So we're betting... What?
[308:20.15]No 10 million token bet?
[308:21.97]Nope.
[308:22.76]I just always know when I got the lower card.
[308:25.22]Call it my sixth sense.
[308:27.20]Or seventh, if you count my sense of humor.
[308:29.96]We doubt.
[308:30.96]Well, we're certainly never getting rich at this rate.
[308:36.00]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[308:38.17]No, it's stained with tobacco juice.
[308:41.03]What?
[308:41.21]Not squalid, yet candid.
[308:42.81]Normally, I like that in a gambler.
[308:44.97]But for you, we'll make an exception.
[308:47.66]That's fucking kind of gross.
[308:50.70]Leonard's steak charmer, huh?
[308:52.68]You don't look like a Leonard's steak charmer.
[308:55.08]Oh, yeah?
[308:56.08]What do I look like?
[308:57.66]You look more like, uh, Boris Krinkle.
[309:00.87]That's what everyone says.
[309:04.80]Okay, uh, what else we got?
[309:06.98]Dialogue options.
[309:08.58]Yeah, I'm a wooden Indian.
[309:11.18]As in, wouldn't bet against me if I was you.
[309:14.10]I'll kill him.
[309:15.36]Not yet.
[309:17.15]Kill him.
[309:19.25]Yeah, why would anybody even play you?
[309:20.19]How do you get anyone to gamble with you?
[309:22.07]Frankly, you seem shady.
[309:23.67]I offer great odds, and I possess a certain subtle charm.
[309:28.15]I hate to break it to you, but non-existent and subtle are two different things.
[309:32.49]Maybe charm is a euphemism for gum disease.
[309:35.35]Look, I'm here to play poker.
[309:37.33]Are we going to get this dog and bunny show on the road or what?
[309:40.95]No.
[309:42.97]Leonard, you give new meaning to the phrase, a face only a mother could love.
[309:46.59]That escalated kind.
[309:47.47]My mama said I was beautiful.
[309:52.85]That's enough for now.
[309:54.15]Okay.
[309:54.95]Although I could have sworn you were a dog, not a chicken.
[309:57.89]A common mistake.
[310:00.07]Alright, let's go.
[310:03.93]What about the dealer?
[310:04.57]Hello there, freaky bear head wearing card dealer.
[310:07.20]Hello.
[310:07.80]I'm Cuddly Bear.
[310:09.28]Want to play cards?
[310:12.68]No.
[310:13.56]Talk to you later.
[310:14.72]Want to play cards?
[310:16.08]No.
[310:16.68]No, I just said no.
[310:17.38]Alright.
[310:18.94]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[310:21.79]Hold it, Mugs.
[310:23.31]Not Mugs.
[310:24.49]Max.
[310:25.57]I don't care if it's Teddy Ruxpin.
[310:27.57]No one gets in without a password.
[310:29.71]I have a password.
[310:30.59]That would be what again?
[310:32.35]Why don't you tell me?
[310:36.26]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[310:38.36]I don't know.
[310:39.20]I set fire to the drapes.
[310:40.90]I love to watch things burn.
[310:42.54]That's not the password?
[310:43.16]Hey, me too!
[310:44.38]I'm sorry I asked.
[310:46.82]That's not the password.
[310:48.80]The password is swordfish.
[310:51.34]Nope.
[310:54.79]The password is rosebud.
[310:57.68]Nope.
[311:02.22]The password is password.
[311:04.90]Nope.
[311:07.28]Let us in.
[311:08.28]Only Toy Mafia allowed in.
[311:10.46]Not that there's any mafia here.
[311:12.61]Okay, we'd like to sign up for the Toy Mafia, please.
[311:16.04]Talk to Chuckles.
[311:17.34]He's the head of Mafia Admissions.
[311:19.66]Where's Chuckles?
[311:21.02]Right behind this door.
[311:22.78]This is what it would be like if Catch-22 had a meaner older brother.
[311:26.68]Look, I don't make the rules.
[311:28.74]I just blindly enforce them.
[311:31.68]Alright, well.
[311:33.30]Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia?
[311:35.58]Nope.
[311:37.14]I've come to Grandma's funeral?

[311:45.79]I am the Wallace?
[311:47.19]Nope.
[311:47.47]How many guesses did I have?
[311:48.83]You remind me of this shopkeeper I know.
[311:51.41]Nope.
[311:53.07]I give up.
[311:53.91]Will you let me in, please?
[311:55.61]Nope.
[311:57.17]The password is?
[311:58.51]Nope.
[312:00.21]We'll be back.
[312:01.21]Like I care.

[315:46.79]I can't do anything about Buffet.
[315:48.84]Buffet closed for semi-annual.
[315:50.44]Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[316:12.58]Peepo hands.
[316:13.74]PepoDance.
[316:16.53]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[316:18.67]Want to play cards?
[316:20.21]We asked first.
[316:21.83]Want to play cards?
[316:22.73]Is he going to do anything else?
[316:27.08]We're looking for someone who works here.
[316:29.16]Want to play cards?
[316:30.30]Fine.
[316:30.70]Sounds like someone played a game of 52 card pickup and lost.
[316:35.62]We'd like to develop a gambling addiction starting now.
[316:38.62]Back for a little more public humiliation?
[316:41.40]Just a little more.
[316:43.56]No, no.
[316:44.18]We'll be back.
[316:45.20]Just remember.
[316:51.34]Alright, let's take, let's, we haven't done anything else besides this.
[316:53.81]Let's go, let's go to the store.
[316:58.21]There are songs in this episode and in episode 4 that are striked by Twitch and YouTube.
[317:02.09]The teddy bear is one of them.
[317:06.10]Well, that's scary.
[317:07.62]Wait, what?
[317:09.64]How do you know that?
[317:12.16]Where'd you get that info?
[317:24.45]It's okay.
[317:24.95]Telltale is dead now.
[317:26.65]Yeah, Telltale doesn't exist anymore.
[317:28.85]Hey, Bosco.
[317:30.03]Nice flapjack.
[317:31.61]Son of Cordon Bleu.
[317:33.59]Who is this, uh, Bosco?
[317:37.03]Hey, guys, it's me, Bosco.
[317:39.56]No.
[317:40.64]But you may call me Jean-François Sissypants, the cowardly French anarchist.
[317:49.96]He changes, like, accents every single episode.
[317:56.58]Sibyl changes professions.
[317:59.30]Everyone's out of their mind.
[318:01.28]We want to buy something.
[318:02.19]Oui, oui, monsieur.
[318:06.17]What do you got?
[318:07.03]Ooh la la.
[318:08.25]Behind the counter, I have the latest in Bosco Tech innovation.
[318:12.66]A device nonpareil on chocolate.
[318:14.66]Congrats, you get the joke.
[318:15.70]Is that good?
[318:16.82]Oui, oui.
[318:17.66]This I call a miniature listening device.
[318:21.52]It can fit in any cravat under any chapeau.
[318:25.26]What's it do?
[318:26.42]It listens.
[318:27.56]You can use it to hear secret conversations, no?
[318:30.94]No.
[318:31.43]I mean, yes.
[318:33.85]Alright, so I need 10 million dollars.
[318:35.19]Probably need to win that at the casino.
[319:01.63]Do you have any straight huffs of Sasquatch hair?
[319:04.83]No.
[319:06.51]Do you have any hats in the shape of a cow udder?
[319:09.94]No.
[319:11.88]Do you have any rubber chickens with a pulley in the middle?
[319:15.82]No.
[319:17.44]Do you have any amulets of protection against greater hypnosis?
[319:21.67]No.
[319:22.39]We have to hear them all, right?
[319:23.93]Do you have any... How do you know what he was gonna... Okay.
[319:29.52]That's probably it.
[319:30.68]Do you... Do... Do you... Do you... Oh my god.
[319:37.44]Alright.
[319:37.78]Alright.
[319:52.13]Does the carpet match the drink?
[319:53.51]Let's ask you.
[319:55.09]And you know why?
[319:56.27]Because the man doesn't want them to.
[319:58.69]He's threatened by their potential unification.
[320:07.52]Look outside.
[320:08.32]It's the toy mafia.
[320:09.56]What?
[320:10.08]Where?
[320:10.80]Fools.
[320:11.48]There is no one.
[320:13.46]Sorry, Bosco.
[320:14.38]Just yanking your chain, amigo.
[320:16.52]Sacre bleu.
[320:18.22]I could do this all day.
[320:19.70]And I intend to.
[320:22.22]Why the French disguise?
[320:23.74]Let's listen to it.
[320:25.20]So Bosco, why'd you get Frenchified?
[320:27.56]They saw right through my British disguise.
[320:30.59]I don't know how they did it, but they found me.
[320:34.13]Who?
[320:34.97]The Mafia.
[320:35.87]The Toy Mafia.
[320:37.07]They've got an in for me.
[320:38.83]Take a number, guys.
[320:41.71]So now what's the Toy Mafia up to?
[320:42.97]Nightmarish atrocities has the Toy Mafia committed against you.
[320:46.62]What's this guy in deliveries?
[321:08.17]Another delivery conspiracy?
[321:10.13]What could a band of ruthless toy mongers possibly want to put in here?
[321:13.83]I don't know.
[321:15.81]But it is no matter.
[321:17.32]They will never be able to deliver anything to my store.
[321:20.66]Or my name is not Jean-Francois Sissypants.
[321:24.96]But your name's not Jean-Francois Sissypants.
[321:28.72]They don't know that.
[321:32.71]What's keeping the Toy Mafia from making a delivery?
[321:35.11]Well, for one, I am watching always.
[321:37.47]They will never sneak past me.
[321:39.79]Yeah, just like Whizzer couldn't sneak past you.
[321:42.64]And two, even if they do get past me, I got a failsafe.
[321:46.42]It's the greatest invention the world has seen since... Get grenades behind him now.
[321:50.52]I call it the Bosco Tech Anti-Delivery System.
[321:54.28]What's the acronym for that?
[321:56.18]Uh, also BTAD.
[321:58.15]It is BTAD's party!
[322:02.90]Used to be just cigarettes back then.
[322:09.03]Now it's... grenades.
[322:11.75]He keeps switching the accents in.
[322:13.19]Really?
[322:13.41]Okay.
[322:33.49]So he's got a camera here now.
[322:34.75]Alright.
[322:34.93]This is your camera.
[322:36.19]Anti-delivery camera.
[322:36.99]No, I'm not trying to deliver something.
[322:39.16]Alright, I got this magnet.
[323:08.87]What am I supposed to do with the magnet?
[323:09.85]Holy shit.
[323:14.51]What the fuck?
[323:14.89]Alright.
[323:17.51]So.
[323:17.61]Sybil!
[323:17.79]What are you up to in this episode?
[323:42.89]What have you changed into?
[323:44.67]Who are you now?
[323:54.44]Still alien?
[323:57.36]Still alien?
[323:58.52]Okay.
[323:58.82]Uh...
[324:13.54]What exactly is a professional trial witness?
[324:16.03]Oh, it's great.
[324:17.69]We give dramatic testimonies, sequester in ritzy hotels, and order room service in the name of truth and justice.
[324:25.51]Did her voice change?
[324:27.12]Sounds like a different actress.
[324:31.08]Do you have a problem with that, Mr. Freelance Police?
[324:34.46]Yeah, why didn't we think of it?
[324:38.49]Alright, what's the case?
[324:39.55]Do you have your first case yet?
[324:41.28]No, but I'm waiting for a call from the district attorney.
[324:44.20]He says he's got something I'd be perfect for.
[324:46.02]Guy Fieri curtains.
[324:47.02]You don't feel uncomfortable getting a case first and then being a witness for it?
[324:50.34]It really is.
[324:50.98]Not at all.
[324:51.88]You see, the problem with most trials is that crimes are witnessed by someone who's unprepared for what's going to happen.
[324:57.99]Or who doesn't have sufficient training or skill to accurately remember or relate what happened.
[325:02.95]With my background and widely varied skill set, I'm perfect.
[325:06.80]I know what that means.
[325:07.94]But I don't know how.
[325:12.86]It's like a Guy Fieri.
[325:15.00]Is his shirt?
[325:16.10]Or his car?
[325:16.78]Is that tattoo?
[325:20.46]That image is just synonymous with Guy Fieri and I can't put on to why.
[325:25.06]His shirt?
[325:29.54]He wears like the fire bowling shirts?
[325:33.43]Right, okay.
[325:34.39]For some reason, I didn't think that was the case.
[325:37.97]You know, he drives it on a... It doesn't have fire on the car.
[325:41.35]It's the official flag of Flavortown.
[326:14.19]relax relax relax relax hey does god fear he got ferret is the carpet badge the drapes oh that's killer oh that's out of the park man
[326:42.84]Mmm, we got it.
[326:43.38]This charred pile of scrap serves as a touching reminder of the fun we had at WARP TV.
[326:48.78]I've determined that whether for food or for sport, I just really enjoy frying things.
[326:59.23]Alright, I need to go back to the casino.
[327:03.75]I need to go back there.
[327:06.27]In real life.

[329:14.26]I'd rather keep it to myself.
[329:16.88]What?
[329:20.57]That is one shiny nose.
[329:22.65]Almost as shiny as yours.
[329:24.59]Keep it up and you'll get a shine or two.
[329:26.39]Wait a minute.
[329:28.63]That is one shiny nose.
[329:30.87]He can see his card.
[329:32.65]Keep it up and you'll get a shine or two.
[329:37.57]Isn't that interesting?

[330:24.89]I need to get in that chair.
[330:29.69]Turn reflections off in this setting.
[330:32.79]How do I move him?
[330:38.38]Or block it.
[330:39.72]Like a blanket or a drape or something.
[330:58.72]Use a carpet or the drapes.
[331:08.20]Oh, I'm getting tired.
[331:11.00]Stuff like that's really fucking doing it for me.
[331:23.25]Let's go.
[331:27.69]Why are Grillmaster Barbecue's emotes not allowed in here?
[331:30.51]Because that guy sucks.
[331:38.13]Are you serious?
[331:39.11]Do I have to explain that?
[331:40.17]A very disturbed individual sits here.
[331:45.85]Jimmy Two-Teeth.
[331:46.99]Fence.
[331:48.05]It's a sad day when hard-working rodents have to make their living as a freestanding form of enclosure.
[331:53.86]I think that's fence in the buys-and-sells-stolen-goods sense of the word.
[331:57.62]Beat it!
[331:58.14]You're getting in the way of my customers!
[332:00.34]You running an illegal casino in here?
[332:03.36]Jimmy Two-Teeth.
[332:04.86]Beat it!
[332:06.67]Hey, an ace.
[332:07.79]An extra card up your sleeve and it never hurts.
[332:10.75]Except when the other guy catches you with it and decides to riddle every inch of your body with high caliber bullets and then dump your mutilated corpse in an empty field.
[332:17.78]How am I supposed to do this?
[332:19.12]I don't know why I thought that wasn't going to do anything.
[332:33.33]So I can cheat here.
[332:35.19]So let him win, because he knows he's going to.
[332:48.26]Where are we going, Sam?
[332:50.82]Teddy Bear's Mafia III Playland and Casino.
[332:54.14]Goody.
[332:56.28]Goodies.
[332:56.86]Wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee wee.
[333:04.07]Welcome to teddy bears mafia free.
[333:07.19]You know what?
[333:13.05]Is it against the rules to bring your own cards?
[333:15.72]Sure, but everybody does it anyhow.
[333:17.64]Hey, I'm about to cheat.
[333:19.16]Excuse me, guard.
[333:20.40]I'm bringing in an ace and I'm going to use it at this table over here.
[333:23.14]I just want to make sure you're aware.
[333:25.76]Alright, so... What about... Hold on.
[333:30.88]What do I do with this magnet?
[333:35.64]I'd rather keep it to myself.
[333:51.81]Can I put the card up there?
[333:59.39]Wow, it sticks.
[334:03.15]So he's gonna think it's an ace every time.
[334:07.74]Hello, cuddly bear.
[334:09.42]Want to play cards?
[334:11.20]Yes.
[334:12.55]We want to play cards.
[334:13.93]Back for a little more public humiliation?
[334:16.69]Just a little more.
[334:19.23]Deal.
[334:20.41]Alright.
[334:23.77]So he thinks he has an ace.
[334:27.62]He does have an ace.
[334:28.56]He has a four.
[334:29.48]Okay.
[334:32.22]Would you look at that?
[334:36.45]I'm betting all 10 million, and you only got to bet one.
[334:40.80]So, you in or out?
[334:45.38]In.
[334:46.12]Sure, we'll bet a token.
[334:50.22]Sorry, Fido.
[334:51.48]You lose.
[334:52.78]The dog wins.
[334:54.54]What?
[334:55.92]You cheated me.
[334:57.32]What are you talking about, Leonard?
[334:59.22]How did we cheat?
[335:00.79]You pay up, steak charmer.
[335:03.35]Mama, why weren't you watching over me?
[335:06.27]That's kind of sad.
[335:07.09]So I got 10 million.
[335:08.61]Which gives me a thing to listen.
[335:09.43]Which I assume I have to put on the door.
[335:11.23]And I can hear the password through the door.
[335:12.61]Let's go get the- Let's do it.
[335:35.49]That was all he had.
[335:38.39]Well, don't fucking cheat people.
[335:41.63]You got ten million of them.
[335:44.90]Stash a million in your pocket and then be a dickhead with nine million.
[335:48.74]I don't care.
[335:56.38]Go put a million in the bank and then you can do whatever you want.
[336:06.46]Why don't I double-click to run?
[336:08.26]Because it's not in this game.
[336:11.44]It is not in Salmon Max Season 1.
[336:15.24]Unfortunately.
[336:15.86]T. T. Alright, let's take it.
[336:31.59]The guy that's running the convenience store here, he's making millions of dollars.
[336:38.59]Okay, Stinky Pants, here's your 10 million.
[336:41.30]By the sacred state of St.
[336:43.18]Gainsbourg, these are not American dollars.
[336:46.98]No, but there are 10 million of them.
[336:49.28]Hmm.
[336:50.46]Well, the prizes at Teddy Bear's can be quite useful.
[336:54.46]I accept.
[336:55.46]And in return, I give you the miniature listening device.
[337:01.65]This is a bug.
[337:02.95]Precisement.
[337:04.62]Does this thing really work?
[337:06.44]Does this thing really work?
[337:08.30]That answer your question?
[337:10.06]Now listen up, maggots.
[337:11.74]I am a bug.
[337:13.42]Drop me in enemy territory and I will get all the information you need.
[337:18.55]You just make sure to pick me up again and I will repeat every word.
[337:23.13]Every word.
[337:23.81]This one's actually worth $10,000.
[337:24.59]We'll be putting you in some situations that could be quite precarious.
[337:28.39]Think you can handle it?
[337:30.13]I was a non-boy.
[337:31.59]You don't want to know what I've been through.
[337:33.69]They slaughtered ladybugs.
[337:35.99]Ladybugs!
[337:37.04]The last one was a balloon with helium in it.
[337:39.22]This is a talking animal.
[337:42.48]Larvae!
[337:45.08]So yeah, I think I can handle it.
[337:47.31]Now I need some shut-eye before the mission.
[337:49.57]Put me in your pocket.
[337:50.79]In your pocket!
[337:51.71]Move, maggot!
[337:52.39]Sir, yes sir!
[337:58.88]you are a talking animal right but that's where they're probably worth a lot of money where are we going sam
[338:24.07]We're probably worth a huge amount of money.
[338:26.75]If somebody said, hey, you know, we have dogs here.
[338:40.22]Yeah, we have dachshunds.
[338:50.93]Oh, cool.
[338:51.59]How much is a dachshund?
[338:53.07]Well, $450... $425.
[338:54.07]Well, that's kind of expensive, but okay.
[338:57.15]Any of them talk English?
[339:02.93]Yes, this one does.
[339:04.41]I would expect it would be at least a million to ten million.
[339:10.06]That's what I'm saying.
[339:10.70]Alright, let's draw the bug here.
[339:16.02]Get in there.
[339:26.86]Do I have to... Hold on.
[339:28.30]Somebody opens the door, right?
[339:35.26]Alright.
[339:36.58]So I gotta put the bug on him.
[339:40.24]Alright, I see.
[339:40.94]Is he gonna notice this and be annoyed at this, or what?
[340:01.47]A talking dog without human intelligence would be kind of useless though, don't you think?
[340:07.42]I mean, but that doesn't matter though, it can still talk.
[340:10.94]Yeah, it would say one word, it would just be... P!
[340:14.26]Outside!
[340:15.28]Poo!
[340:29.95]Actually, that would be bad though, because you would hear all kinds of weird fucked up shit.
[340:33.28]Now listen up.
[340:34.12]Here's what they said.
[340:35.66]Hold it.
[340:36.26]What's the password?
[340:38.00]That's gotta be, what, a hundred times I've come through that door today, and you still don't recognize me?
[340:44.04]It's the bareheads, boss.
[340:45.73]They all look alike.
[340:48.27]Leave the gun.
[340:49.17]Take the cannolis.
[340:50.67]You may enter.
[340:52.15]Now get me in that pocket.
[340:53.95]Move!
[340:54.91]Sir, yes sir.
[340:57.73]Imagine if all dogs were still dogs, but they walked upright like Sam.
[341:03.46]That would be really fucking weird.
[341:06.36]They're just normal dogs, but they walk around as people.
[341:12.78]Oh, that would be really messed up.
[341:17.37]Because then they could go in the fridge.
[341:19.21]They would be able to open the fridge and eat.
[341:21.07]They'd get like the mustard out and stuff.
[341:23.95]Imagine the dog opening up the fridge and getting his face in there and just eating like a whole birthday cake.
[341:35.99]Still no thumbs.
[341:36.63]That doesn't matter.
[341:37.23]They can just put their hand in and pull.
[341:50.36]Where would they eat?
[341:51.28]Would they eat on the ground still?
[341:53.12]Or would you have to put... Would you have to put a plate on a table and sit them at the table?
[341:59.04]They stand up and lean down?
[342:01.68]Would they put, you know, but usually a dog bowl is on the ground.
[342:07.63]Leave the gun.
[342:08.43]Take the cannolis.
[342:09.89]You may enter.
[342:11.05]Would the dogs be able to float?
[342:13.61]What?
[342:20.81]This is it?
[342:21.77]Where's the food?
[342:22.89]Surely there's a buffet back here.
[342:24.79]Hey, look.
[342:25.59]That must be Teddy Bear.
[342:27.49]Where do you wise guys think you're going?
[342:30.69]Who, us?
[342:31.75]We were just browsing.
[342:33.19]We frown on that around here.
[342:35.17]I'm Chuckles, the casino pit boss.
[342:37.99]I've had my eye on you.
[342:39.21]Uh, how long have you been watching us?
[342:42.59]Long enough.
[342:43.43]Do I look any taller than I did ten minutes ago?
[342:46.43]Your win at poker was, shall we say, creative.
[342:50.83]Why, whatever, are you insinuating?
[342:52.95]That was nice work.
[342:54.37]You also somehow got the password to let you into this room.
[342:57.89]Very clever.
[342:59.25]I'm impressed.
[343:00.17]Where's the mole?
[343:00.83]The Toy Mafia can use guys who are long on brains and short on scruples.
[343:05.37]Are you interested?
[343:06.30]Uh...
[343:12.38]Great, once we're in, we can find that mole.
[343:14.42]Sounds good.
[343:15.10]I can't think of anything I'd rather do.
[343:16.76]At least not for the next five minutes.
[343:18.58]I've always wanted to be a thug.
[343:20.46]Officially, I mean.
[343:22.00]The fact that you've already got your own animal costume shows great initiative.
[343:26.28]But before we can accept you into the family, there are two jobs I need you to do.
[343:31.92]Chuckle.
[343:32.50]Bad news.
[343:33.28]The original meatball sandwich has been stolen.
[343:35.78]There are three jobs I need you to do for us.
[343:38.90]What kind of jobs?
[343:40.67]Oh, the usual.
[343:42.05]I want you to lean on somebody, I want you to whack somebody, and I want you to recover a small item that belongs to us.
[343:51.19]Who do you want us to lean on?
[343:53.65]A local shopkeeper who's been refusing to stock our products.
[343:57.32]Take these special teddy bears and make sure he displays them on the sale table in the front of his store.
[344:02.79]No problem.
[344:04.15]The store is called Bosco's Inconvenience.
[344:08.39]No problem.
[344:13.01]Who do you want us to kill?
[344:13.90]Who do you want us to whack?
[344:15.18]We're having trouble with a witness who refuses to see things our way.
[344:19.38]I want you to silence a certain civil pandemic.
[344:23.26]Silence as in gag her?
[344:25.23]Gag her with a pistol.
[344:27.71]Jesus.
[344:28.74]He want us to kill Sybil.
[344:30.96]Make it messy as a message to other potential witnesses.
[344:33.98]Messy murder.
[344:34.70]We have her under surveillance, so we'll be watching.
[344:38.04]Yikes.
[344:41.50]Okay.
[344:42.70]How are we supposed to... Wait.
[344:45.41]What is it that you want us to recover?
[344:47.25]It's that rotting old sandwich, right?
[344:49.25]The original meatball sandwich has great sentimental value to our organization.
[344:54.23]I want you to track it down before the disrespectful slimebag who stole it manages to fence it to some other lowlife.
[345:01.50]Sounds detective-y.
[345:03.22]Deal with the thief as you see fit.
[345:05.28]We'd like to preserve plausible deniability on this one.
[345:11.12]Okay.
[345:12.06]I think we've got it.
[345:13.46]Do these three things, Sam and Max, and you shall be as we are.
[345:17.10]We never said our names.
[345:18.21]Verbally overwrought?
[345:19.69]Members of the Toy Mafia.
[345:22.11]Oh, right.
[345:26.31]We want to talk to your boss.
[345:27.93]Nobody talks to Don Teddy Bear, the head of the Toy Mafia.
[345:32.07]Doesn't he get lonely?
[345:33.21]Except other members of the Toy Mafia.
[345:36.59]Oh, that'd explain it.
[345:41.29]Does the carpet match the drapes?
[345:43.31]The drapes?
[345:45.64]Oh, I'll tell you about the drapes, my friend.
[345:48.78]No, that's okay.
[345:50.18]Maybe his hobby is interior decorating, Sam.
[345:52.90]Let's not chance it.
[345:54.68]Alright.
[345:56.20]We'll be back.
[345:57.24]A word of advice, because I like you two.
[345:59.91]When you walk away from the Toy Mafia, watch your back.
[346:06.51]So, we need to kill Sybil.
[346:11.62]Do not enter under pain of death.
[346:13.12]What's behind that door?
[346:14.80]None of your business.
[346:20.36]Looks like you can monitor the whole casino floor from there.
[346:23.65]And a few other places besides.
[346:26.65]Or you could watch Mary Tyler Moore.
[346:28.71]Who told you about that?
[346:31.03]Ooh, Mary Tyler Moore.
[346:34.83]That's a show.
[346:36.21]That's a show that was on television.
[346:37.81]Alright, what about Workstation?
[346:40.49]What is this thing?
[346:42.03]Mine.
[346:42.81]Stay away from it.
[346:45.03]Alright, what about any of these people?
[346:48.54]What is Ted?
[346:50.18]Where do you think you're going?
[346:52.02]Back there?
[346:53.06]No one may approach Don Teddy Bear except for other members of the Toy Mafia.
[346:58.20]It's Jeff from Psychology!
[346:59.82]Alright, let's go.
[347:11.37]I'm a little frustrated I wasn't able to work the word glockenspiel into our conversation, but you're welcome How am I going to kill Sibyl?
[347:22.30]I have to fake it, right?
[347:29.34]How do you kill somebody?
[347:33.77]Teddy toy box?
[347:35.43]Magnet?
[347:39.75]Let's figure this out
[347:50.25]I mean, I know I have a gun, but I'm not gonna actually go kill Sibyl.
[347:52.57]Well, let's get a plan.
[348:09.70]No.
[348:24.96]Howdy, Sybil.
[348:25.98]No, no, you've got the wrong person.
[348:28.12]I mean Dame.
[348:29.06]I mean Dame person.
[348:30.26]Isn't Dame person that big-chin puppet used to scare children?
[348:34.25]Oh, Sam, Max, thank goodness it's you.
[348:38.01]I thought it was someone come to kill me.
[348:40.49]Yes, well... You seem, understandably, a little tense.
[348:47.14]Maybe you should switch to decaf.
[348:49.06]What?
[348:49.60]Oh, yes.
[348:50.40]The coffee cup.
[348:51.56]I'm out of coffee, but I'm so nervous I keep trying to drink it anyway.
[348:54.75]It's funny how stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes.
[348:59.95]Is that what happened to me?
[349:01.39]Wouldn't it be wonderful to think so?
[349:05.76]How's it working?
[349:06.22]How's that new profession working out?
[349:08.46]Oh, Sam.
[349:09.54]The life of a professional witness isn't all courtroom theatrics and finger pointing.
[349:14.30]The toy mafia told me if I testified against them, they'd rub me out.
[349:19.12]They tried to buy you off with a Swedish massage?
[349:22.15]No, Max.
[349:23.45]I think they meant murder.
[349:27.97]Alright.
[349:30.87]Time's up.
[349:31.87]It's been 45 minutes.
[349:40.15]It's been 45 minutes.
[349:47.29]We got our task.
[349:48.49]We got our thing that we're gonna do.
[349:56.56]Yeah, it's getting late.
[350:02.02]Daylight savings.
[350:02.94]You're an hour slow.
[350:04.58]Make it an even six hours?
[350:05.70]Well, it's going to be, because we're gonna do some stuff.
[350:08.19]We're gonna watch a video.
[350:10.34]This video is, I think, 20 minutes long.
[350:13.66]We're going to do the bits.
[350:14.42]We're going to hang out.
[350:18.80]So the stream's not over.
[350:26.17]Let me save the game.
[350:27.37]Yeah, this is probably a good stopping point.
[350:29.23]We got through the casino.
[350:30.45]We stopped here.
[350:31.69]We got the task.
[350:36.52]We'll be back.
[350:40.37]So, Sam and Max, on the stream when I come back from my vacation, will probably... will pick this back up.
[350:59.36]This might not be the first thing coming back, because there's a couple things that I would like to do.
[351:06.50]But we're going to finish Season 1.
[351:08.68]I promise.
[351:09.56]Guaranteed.
[351:12.42]I want to see how this goes through.
[351:14.76]It might be the first thing that happens when we come back.
[351:16.34]It might be a day later.
[351:21.51]We'll see.
[351:25.95]Season 2 is where it gets really good.
[351:29.19]I'm all for it.
[351:30.03]I'm all just to hang out and play.
[351:33.86]Again, I want to start incorporating more of these just chill streams where we play a game.
[351:41.58]We dial it up to like a thousand sometimes on this stream, so it's nice to pull it back a little.
[351:51.31]But that is going to be the end of this portion.
[351:54.79]I'm going to save it before it gets to be too late.
[352:05.55]Monster Rancher 4 is another one that I have to continue.
[352:13.21]And these are all episodic.
[352:14.95]So this is saved, right?
[352:19.81]Alright, so now... Let me transition to over here.
[352:23.57]If you've taken off, I will say see you soon.
[352:30.39]I'm not going to be live for about a week.
[352:34.18]What is today?
[352:34.70]Today's technically, this is Saturday.
[352:36.98]So I'm probably, you're probably not going to see me until somewhere around Friday.
[352:42.74]I'm going to be gone for almost a full week.
[352:47.37]Don't forget about me.
[352:48.31]You're not going to forget about me, right?
[352:51.81]You're not going to, I'll be back, I'll be back real soon, not even a week.
[353:08.80]Don't you forget about me.
[353:09.98]Well, I'm not going to forget about you guys.
[353:16.41]We'll be watching Grillmaster.
[353:21.99]You cracked me up, little buddy.
[353:24.46]Alright, so now let's... There's a video that we're going to watch.
[353:29.14]Let me get it.
[353:31.00]Because it's very intriguing.
[353:37.56]If you're going to bed, the stream is at a close at the moment.
[353:42.92]We're just going to hang out, do the bits like we normally do.
[353:45.32]If you want to stick around and watch this community-made video about the rumbles.
[353:55.85]Let me get it.
[353:58.99]And, you know, let's take a final break.
[354:02.23]So I'm going to go pee.
[354:03.93]We'll do a final break, come back, and we'll probably go for like another hour.
[354:08.15]Maybe.
[354:08.59]This is about 20 minutes and then we'll do the bits and everything.
[354:10.56]So I'll be back.
[354:12.98]Final break of the night.
[354:15.04]See you in a moment.
[354:18.24]I'm also going to pull this up too.
[354:21.41]See you in a sec.
[358:23.02]Wait, I didn't... I'm not back?
[358:25.66]I just pressed the button.
[358:26.64]I've been talking for like a full minute.
[358:29.36]Well, that's annoying.
[358:34.40]I've been talking this whole time.
[358:44.89]Let's get this here.
[358:45.81]Alright, so this is, I don't know, I really don't know what this is.
[358:50.82]This is a fan community movie, short film kind of project.
[358:56.60]It looked really interesting, so figured why not give it a look and see how it is.
[359:03.87]Gonna put it on the screen here in just a second.
[359:18.05]Should... work?
[359:20.93]Is that gonna work?
[359:24.11]Let's see if I can pull it through here.
[359:28.39]Why am I still streaming?
[359:29.47]Well, because I started at like 7 o'clock Pacific.
[359:33.52]And... you know.
[359:35.32]I'm gonna be gone for quite a while.
[359:43.02]You will not see me for a week.
[359:44.96]So I wanted to, you know, stay up, stream later, stream like four straight days in a row.
[359:49.14]And I'm gonna be gone for a while, so, you know.
[359:54.83]Here we go, this is called Rumble.
[359:56.19]This is a short film.

[361:15.45]trench coat.
[361:19.41]How many people are in there?
[361:20.99]How many characters?
[361:23.23]Talker Tim, that's not a Rumble character.
[361:25.55]Oh, there's Daffy Daffy the Richard.
[361:32.47]Let's see.
[361:35.67]Yeah, yeah, I'll see you in a bit.
[361:45.48]Jeremy, my boy.
[361:46.73]How the devil are you?
[361:47.99]Pretty good, thanks.
[361:48.65]Yeah, whatever.
[361:49.09]Sit down.
[361:53.33]Jeremy, I need your help.
[361:55.07]Go on.
[361:55.69]People who fuck with me get fucked, right?
[361:57.93]What?
[361:59.27]Derek.
[362:00.05]You know Derek, right?
[362:01.17]No.
[362:01.79]Derek the fucking thief.
[362:04.65]He stole my fucking briefcase, he did.
[362:06.43]What briefcase?
[362:07.37]My briefcase.
[362:09.65]Look, I need you to find him, get the briefcase, but don't look in it.
[362:13.78]It's a very crucial part.
[362:14.64]Do not look inside the briefcase.
[362:16.92]And then when you've got it, bring it back to me.
[362:19.34]Alright?
[362:19.77]Understood.
[362:20.11]Also, you're going to have to kill him.
[362:22.45]OK.
[362:24.75]If that's alright with you.
[362:26.67]Yeah, I guess.
[362:28.87]My best friend, Derek.
[362:34.96]So where's he going to be?
[362:36.32]Well, he's trying to escape as we speak, probably.
[362:38.02]But he's at Shay's, the strip joint, normally.
[362:40.70]Can you do this for me?
[362:41.90]You got it.
[362:47.06]Sorted.
[362:47.52]Oh, and don't forget, don't look in the briefcase.
[362:52.40]It's Joe, my boy.
[362:53.80]He's got your mannerisms down.
[362:58.03]I act like that?
[362:58.67]Is this piss?
[363:19.89]Derek?
[363:21.21]Yes.
[363:23.18]That belongs to Richard.
[363:25.72]Briefcase.
[363:28.62]Yeah.
[363:29.40]You gonna give it to me or what?
[363:30.90]No.
[363:32.92]Give me the briefcase.
[363:34.29]Listen to me.
[363:35.15]Richard is a bad man.
[363:36.59]He didn't deserve the money.
[363:40.37]I didn't do this.
[363:40.95]This is not based on reality, by the way.
[363:42.55]Money?
[363:44.04]Didn't tell you, huh?
[363:45.88]£199,787 to be exact.
[363:49.90]Why such a specific amount, huh?
[363:52.04]A small amount has already been spent.
[363:54.08]When the time comes, he'll take your view just like he's getting rid of me now.
[364:05.63]As soon as you give it back to him, he'll kill you to tie up loose ends.
[364:10.33]Richard wouldn't kill me.
[364:12.59]Whatever.
[364:20.08]That's what we dick-tasked with the Richards?
[364:22.11]I'm trusting.
[364:24.20]Beware.
[364:48.85]Are you gonna give me some panting answers or I'm gonna blow your fucking balls off?
[364:52.05]Capisce, sunshine?
[364:53.25]Who's this?
[364:54.91]What to do?
[364:58.47]Don't shoot him.
[364:59.03]Don't do it.
[365:04.02]Hang on a second.
[365:10.08]That's his intro.
[365:10.92]Bonjour.
[365:11.74]Hi, Richard.
[365:12.50]It's Jeremy.
[365:13.90]I've got the briefcase.
[365:15.52]Good word.
[365:16.80]And Eric?
[365:19.78]He's dead.
[365:22.78]Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.
[365:27.06]This isn't even a movie.
[365:27.93]They're just framing you for murder.
[365:28.99]I've got a few loose ends to deal with.
[365:35.13]Yeah, yeah, I'll bring the money to you now.
[365:40.34]Money?
[365:41.82]Jeremy, you didn't look inside the briefcase, did you?
[365:44.44]Uh-oh, he broke the one fucking rule.
[365:48.94]Whoa!
[365:49.12]Who was that?
[365:55.32]What character was that?
[366:24.54]I've heard a lot about you.
[366:25.36]If you do this for me, you'll be rewarded handsomely.
[366:29.68]You've got till three.
[366:31.40]Then I'll be sending reinforcements.
[366:34.47]Get it done.
[366:48.73]Ari, what money is that?
[366:49.93]How much is that?
[367:21.69]That was me.
[367:24.10]Yeah.
[367:25.04]Oh, my god.
[367:33.92]What the heck?
[367:45.09]Oh, no.
[367:45.23]He's got VR reloading speed.
[367:50.09]Holy shit.
[368:08.45]That's two murders!
[368:22.04]Who is this character?
[368:23.52]Hi Tim, I can't explain.
[368:25.58]Can I stay around yours?
[368:27.64]Yeah, just make sure you wipe your feet before you come in.
[368:31.92]Um, yeah, sure, okay.
[368:34.70]I'll see you tonight.
[368:35.62]New character.
[368:40.68]It's 20, it's 20 minutes long.
[368:47.30]They do have the signature, that is true.
[368:50.02]The gray shirt and jeans.
[368:51.62]Listen, you're my last hope.
[368:52.48]I need you to go to Jeremy's house, alright?
[368:54.09]That shit has my briefcase.
[368:55.59]And find out what happened to that Vier guy as well.
[369:18.76]Don't make me kill somebody else in this movie.
[369:36.91]Where did you even get that picture from?
[369:40.65]Hey, uh, it's Tim.
[369:42.31]Before you come over, get me some Doritos or something, yeah?
[369:58.51]What the fuck?
[370:00.65]What?
[370:01.37]What?
[370:01.69]That was supposed to be a tweet that I put out?
[370:28.93]I killed two people.
[370:30.27]They're fucking dead.
[370:34.75]IRL scream in the woods.
[370:42.01]Where's this tree?
[371:10.85]Bits.
[371:13.52]I love how it's in a laptop bag.
[371:16.18]I think I have that laptop bag.
[371:17.76]I'm coming, Tim!
[371:24.94]Hey, is this Mickey's Pizza Place?
[371:28.46]Yeah, can I order a pizza?
[371:31.65]Yeah, yeah.
[371:32.49]Can I get like ham and cheese?
[371:37.27]Maybe some beef as well.

[371:41.47]Yeah, yeah, just all of the sides as well.
[371:45.10]Pepperoni.
[371:46.96]Yeah, that'd be great.
[371:49.20]That'd be so great.
[371:50.18]Thank you.
[371:51.64]Thank you.
[371:52.04]What is this pizza?
[372:07.34]Is this- does this imply that like I'm going over Tim's house and like get- like getting all fucked up or something?
[372:13.12]That was fast.
[372:23.42]Hey man, I'm- I got the ten pounds.
[372:26.64]It's a- Hey man.
[372:34.52]Is that me doing that?
[372:40.58]Ah, Tim!
[372:41.60]You know your front door's open, mate.
[372:43.14]You can't really just be doing that.
[372:45.52]Thanks for letting me stay, but... What the fuck's that smell?
[372:53.12]Look, man, I'm gonna be honest with you.
[372:54.75]I'm in some trouble with some people.
[372:56.99]I stole this thing, and I just came from burying it, and I should have told you before I asked to stay over.
[373:04.09]I'm really sorry.
[373:09.33]I got this gun.
[373:11.28]I think you'll need it for protection.
[373:13.68]So I think it might put you in danger, Tim.
[373:15.36]I'm really sorry.
[373:16.06]I'm just gonna leave.
[373:19.51]Oh no, but I don't even know.
[373:20.73]I don't know Tim.
[373:21.73]I think he's just sleeping.
[373:29.30]Check, check him.
[373:30.62]Are you actually going to let me leave?
[373:32.32]Check him.
[373:32.76]Look, I'm sorry I put you in danger and I shouldn't have, but don't give me a silent treatment, please.
[373:37.70]Just let me stay one night, one night, and then I'll be out of your hair by tomorrow.
[373:42.16]Please, Tim, don't be like this.
[373:51.19]You want to hear it?
[373:52.29]I'm sorry.
[373:52.87]What's that?
[373:53.79]I'm sorry for putting you in danger.
[373:55.15]I wasn't thinking straight.
[373:59.69]But please, can I just stay for one night?
[374:02.40]Then I'll be out of your hair by tomorrow morning.
[374:04.58]Please.
[374:08.58]Tim, talk to me, man.
[374:10.14]Oh, that got loud.
[374:10.92]Take me to the briefcase.
[374:12.66]Yeah.
[374:12.90]Why am I walking like this?
[374:30.44]Okay.
[374:39.81]I would be like fucking wicked confident.
[374:43.01]I'd be like, it's over here, relax.
[374:45.11]There it is.

[376:06.08]Oh, here comes the big reveal.
[376:12.20]Fuck you, Richard!
[376:13.14]It's over!
[376:15.15]Well, now that's ridiculous.
[376:16.41]Jaren, my boy.
[376:17.63]Why do this?
[376:18.91]I trusted you.
[376:24.59]You are the reason Tim's dead.
[376:26.47]Oh, shit happens.
[376:28.38]But you, you're a son to me.
[376:31.98]I barely know you.
[376:33.24]I'm an errand boy for you.
[376:36.12]I've killed three people today because of you.
[376:38.08]What's one more going to do?
[376:39.78]Pull the trigger.
[376:40.40]Shoot me right here in my fucking heart.
[376:51.28]Don't do it.
[376:51.76]You can't do four.
[376:54.10]You can get away with this and not suffer the consequences.
[376:58.02]What are you going to do about it?
[377:00.37]I'll tell you what I'll do.
[377:01.65]I'll have ten men, twenty men, thirty men, and I'll find you, and I'll fucking kill you.
[377:07.19]Well, if I kill you, then you can't send anyone after me, can you?
[377:22.27]You've got no frame!
[377:23.67]God dammit!
[377:24.27]Drop me!
[377:48.62]Well, that's a pretty terrible day.
[378:04.35]You're good at something.
[378:05.43]Whoa, what's going on?
[378:06.53]What?
[378:06.65]Bright light said it gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire.
[378:16.90]Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn, so get those stakes up higher.
[378:23.34]There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there.
[378:26.63]Is this how I got here?
[378:27.61]Is this the story?
[378:29.43]And I'm just a devil with love to spare.

[379:39.64]Alright, now at this point, this is where this lowers down, and you get the coming up next on Netflix.
[379:42.98]Well, is there an after credits scene?
[379:44.66]There might be.
[379:59.29]That's pretty good.
[380:00.33]That was pretty good.
[380:01.15]We watched the whole thing.
[380:02.65]We watched the whole thing.
[380:29.40]So you look at Matt like he just said, you're dick.

[380:46.85]That's the after credits scene.
[380:51.79]Well, if you'd like to watch that again... That was... That was a journey.
[380:59.69]It's apparently why- how I moved to Vegas.
[381:06.58]Piece of, uh, fun piece of fiction.
[381:16.49]But that was fucking- that was really well done.
[381:19.55]That was very well made.
[381:28.03]I can't believe that somebody would, you know, have loosely base something around this community and this channel.
[381:35.80]That's like, that was a 20 minute short film.
[381:44.33]So, thank you for that.
[381:46.17]It was fucking, that was wild.
[381:52.20]Let me give you a link.
[381:53.78]I think I did already do.
[381:54.58]Make sure I get the right one here.
[381:55.98]There it is.
[381:56.30]It's called Rumble.
[382:02.17]And with that, my American accent's going really well, yeah.
[382:19.77]It is now 1.15am Pacific.
[382:25.07]Now there's new Jerma OC characters.
[382:28.81]Yeah, have fun with it, whatever.
[382:31.33]If you're having fun with it, then fucking, that's great.
[382:36.60]It's very late.
[382:40.94]I will see all of you.
[382:46.12]Next weekend.
[382:48.84]Saturday.
[382:49.80]Technically, I'll see you next weekend.
[382:51.27]It is Saturday.
[382:55.49]Let's do the bits.
[382:57.91]And that was a bunch of money.
[382:59.81]Streamlabs is currently off for... Let's see.
[383:02.91]No, it's not on anymore.
[383:04.18]What's going on here?
[383:06.36]We just gave 50 bucks.
[383:08.34]PikaBanana, $50.
[383:09.04]No, $70.
[383:09.48]I'm going to be corrected here.
[383:15.98]Thank you for the $70, PikaBanana.
[383:22.46]Uh, I will.
[383:22.66]I will.
[383:22.80]My mother is fantastic.
[383:23.28]One of the reasons why I turned out the way that I did and the person that I am is because of my mother, so...
[383:53.10]I cannot wait to spend some time with her.
[383:55.94]It's been a long time.
[383:56.68]It's the first time I've ever... We talked about it a little bit, but... This is the first time I've ever been far enough away from my family where I physically do not see them.
[384:10.72]At all.
[384:11.82]For more than, you know, six plus months, seven months at a time.
[384:16.97]So, I was always close enough.
[384:20.27]Always.
[384:20.81]Wherever I lived.
[384:22.65]Where it wouldn't be that far.
[384:24.23]So, it's going to be great to see her.
[384:31.15]But, PikaBanana, thank you.
[384:33.53]For the huge amount of money here.
[384:37.84]And we're happy to have you.
[384:38.84]So, thank you.
[384:40.62]You've contributed a lot.
[384:41.52]So, thank you so much.
[384:45.26]And we're going to go back now to about six and a half hours ago.
[384:49.23]This shouldn't take us very long.
[384:54.43]We had Peaceful Hailey with $2.50.
[384:55.47]Thanks for the $2.50, Peaceful Hailey.
[385:01.25]Hey Jeremy, I'm back from my vacation in Texas.
[385:04.29]See, I'm about to go on vacation and you're coming back.
[385:08.69]Wow, I had a really good time.
[385:11.09]I went to a convention.
[385:12.06]I met Chris Sabat, the voice of Vegeta.
[385:15.80]And it really opened my eyes.
[385:16.84]It made me realize how much I want to be a voice actress.
[385:21.40]I was debating it in my head.
[385:23.88]You know, like how I do.
[385:26.24]Do I really want this?
[385:27.76]And doubting myself about it.
[385:29.16]And I want to give up on the dream.
[385:30.99]But after meeting all these cool people, maybe really, really, really want it.
[385:34.39]Love you, Jerma in chat.
[385:37.45]Yeah, go for it.
[385:39.53]Do your best.
[385:46.00]If it's something you really want to do, try it.
[385:48.36]There's no reason not to try and do it.
[385:56.23]That's the thing about dreams.
[385:59.17]They're great to have.
[386:02.51]But they're even better to try and do.
[386:07.11]As long as you're going with the mindset that nothing is certain.
[386:11.27]And always have a backup.
[386:12.78]Always have another plan.
[386:15.26]You can make your dream into something else.
[386:17.56]Always.
[386:19.96]Be realistic.
[386:22.66]Set goals for yourself.
[386:27.77]And go for it.
[386:34.15]I'm glad you had a good time in Texas.
[386:39.43]And it's good to hear.
[386:45.38]Backup plan is gamble in Vegas.
[386:47.56]No, not that kind of backup plan.
[386:51.22]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[386:53.12]Smelly Boy coming in.
[386:55.81]And it is just a YouTube link.
[386:59.01]What is this YouTube link?
[387:04.34]This is people eating fried chicken?
[387:07.68]Content aware... it's a... I don't even know, what the fuck is this?
[387:21.95]Content Over Scaling Remix.
[387:24.46]This is just giving me a headache.
[387:30.68]The video is shaking around and underwater.
[387:33.08]I mean, this is the video.
[387:42.78]Be careful.
[387:43.24]If you get sensitive to underwater movies shaking.
[387:51.77]Thank you for the video.
[388:00.49]Thank you, Smellyboy.
[388:01.41]Hey, thank you to Greg Nightmare for the $5.50.
[388:04.07]Salmon Max is my favorite adventure series of all time.
[388:08.24]You have no idea how happy it makes me to see anybody play it these days.
[388:12.34]PogChamp.
[388:16.12]Yeah, I think it's great.
[388:20.88]I'm absolutely gonna finish at least Season 1.
[388:27.12]I like the cartoon.
[388:28.00]I like anything toon, you know?
[388:32.99]So, it's cool.
[388:33.77]I knew I was gonna like it, I just didn't have a spot to start it.
[388:38.92]You know what I mean?
[388:40.36]It's hard to... Let's put it this way.
[388:42.79]Alright, guys.
[388:44.19]VR.
[388:45.11]We're gonna do some crazy shit in VR.
[388:47.02]You ready?
[388:47.54]Oh, my God.
[388:48.26]Look at all this fucking crazy stuff in VR.
[388:50.36]Sekiro.
[388:51.06]Oh, it's fucking so hard.
[388:52.16]Now we're gonna play Sam and Max.
[388:55.84]It's just hard to place it because it's slowing it down, it's a lot more... It's an experience that you let happen in front of you.
[389:05.12]It's not some, you know, crazy, ridiculous thing that I'm gonna stream.
[389:10.09]So it's hard to find a place to put it sometimes.
[389:13.71]But like I said, I want to start to pull in more of these... Just hanging out and doing something streams.
[389:25.23]But it was always hard to place, because it always, like, was either right before or right after something that was, like, really high energy.
[389:37.65]Did he play episode 3?
[389:38.75]I left because he said he wouldn't.
[389:40.21]Well, I played, like, 40 minutes of episode 3.
[389:49.03]But it looks like people took this kind of stream well.
[389:53.31]Right?
[389:53.53]Because I'm always curious of what people think or how many people are going to watch.
[389:57.83]What are they going to say?
[389:59.23]Move on.
[389:59.71]This is boring.
[390:00.59]Right?
[390:02.01]But I think it was great.
[390:04.67]I thought it was great.
[390:09.61]So you'll definitely see it again.
[390:14.27]Uh, thank you to the true Michi for the three dollars.
[390:16.87]Jeremy, just want to remind you, you did forget me again, as I predicted.
[390:20.67]You wanted to hit me up on Discord, Mr. Forgetful.
[390:24.81]I know, I'm so fucking bad.
[390:26.19]I really am.
[390:26.71]There's, like, a handful of people that I'm, like, supposed to contact on Discord, and it's just, like... My mind is... just wipes every time.
[390:38.19]I really have, like, a fucking boomer memory.
[390:39.97]It's ridiculous.
[390:45.66]Even important shit, even, like, in my own family and friends.
[390:54.30]But, I'm sorry about that.
[391:00.27]Okay, yeah, stream legends, I will, don't worry, before the stream ends.
[391:11.88]Is Ace Attorney still on the to-do list or has it been shelved?
[391:14.10]It has been shelved.
[391:17.00]Temporarily until I find out if it's something I want to stream.
[391:21.34]I'm going to have some time here over this mom vacation.
[391:26.77]Where me and my mother are going to do a bunch of stuff, but I'll have some free time.
[391:30.85]I'm probably going to play a little bit of the first case and then determine if it's something I want to stream.
[391:40.33]Because when I went into that house, I said I wanted to do it.
[391:44.84]It was not the game that I thought it was going to be.
[391:47.86]It's a lot more elaborate.
[391:48.98]It's like an investigative game where you do like detective work.
[391:52.81]I thought it was just kind of like a courtroom argument simulator, but that's not what it is.
[391:57.89]It's like a 40 hour long game.
[392:00.79]I just want to make sure that I don't... What I don't want to do, and I want to stop doing this, and I've been alright with it recently, is starting something that a lot of people want to see, and then realize kind of 20% of the way through it that I really don't think I want to do it anymore, and then don't do it.
[392:20.10]So I really want to start to pick and choose if you're going to see a game that's on the stream, we're going to try to complete it.
[392:32.96]So, I want to try to do that more.
[392:40.18]We'll see.
[392:46.71]But thank you, Frodeon Weapon, for the five dollars.
[392:49.01]They say, ka-chow, what's up, fellow Jermamites?
[392:52.95]It's your boy Frodeon back at it again with the drunk bit messages.
[392:56.77]But seriously, Jerma, hope your mom has a fun and safe trip to Vegas.
[393:00.68]You crack me up a little, buddy.
[393:05.03]Yeah.
[393:09.48]I will see her very soon.
[393:11.60]Looking forward to it.
[393:14.26]When you move to his thing, when you move to a new city, and you have friends or family come over, it's just awesome to kind of vicariously live through their new experiences that you've already had, but you get to watch them have it now.
[393:28.15]Oh, we're going to go to the Strip.
[393:29.61]Oh, yeah.
[393:30.07]Hey, well, look at that.
[393:31.51]Oh, that's the Bellagio.
[393:32.89]Oh, yeah.
[393:33.22]Take a look at that.
[393:33.84]And you see them interact with it.
[393:35.40]We're going to go downtown.
[393:37.78]There's something to be said about showing somebody a city or really anything.
[393:54.50]Can I take her to Hash House at Go-Go?
[393:56.40]Probably.
[393:57.34]That's my favorite restaurant in the whole city.
[394:01.20]But it'll be great.
[394:04.24]Jess, you got it.
[394:04.82]Thanks for the 250, Jess.
[394:06.82]A psychoanalyst stream would be gold.
[394:08.61]I'd love to hear what a professional has to say about your dogshit enhanced stream.
[394:15.89]I want to just go get like a full personality test done with the blots, with the ink stuff, with the questions.
[394:22.25]They would have to be comfortable doing that though, because... I told you about the lie detector shit, how people did not think that was cool.
[394:30.16]I think that whole story is on video.
[394:33.00]And it's been watched a bunch of times.
[394:35.26]About how it was absolute hell to... Everybody hated us when we tried to get the lie detector thing going.
[394:43.81]There's a whole stream about how we were like avoided.
[394:48.67]People thought we were, like, dicks for, like, wanting to make, like, a comedic piece about lie detecting.
[394:57.00]We called every fucking lie detector, you know, firm or attorney in two or three states.
[395:09.08]And they all fucking hated us.
[395:10.22]So...
[395:14.15]You don't, you never want to, like, be... Hey, you're, like, a therapist, or you're, like, a psychoanalyst, or you're, like, a scientist.
[395:22.33]Hey, we're gonna do a joke where, like, you analyze me on stream.
[395:26.07]Funny, huh?
[395:27.17]And then they're like, no, that's not funny.
[395:29.59]Oh.
[395:31.24]Okay.
[395:33.84]Call somebody else.
[395:35.70]It's hard to do that.
[395:39.16]But it's definitely worth a shot, I think.
[395:48.32]Because you never really, I mean, make a joke out of somebody's profession.
[395:51.50]You know what I'm saying?
[395:52.32]That's not what my intentions ever are.
[396:02.19]It'll be interesting.
[396:02.79]That would be very interesting.
[396:05.27]We'll see.
[396:06.70]Hey, Mobling, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[396:08.21]Thanks for playing one of my favorite series.
[396:09.35]You should check out Sam & Max Hittin' the Road if you plan on doing more.
[396:13.13]Have a nice break with your mom.
[396:15.21]Thank you for the $10, Mobling.
[396:17.17]And if we're still going and Sam & Max is still something people want to see after Season 1, and it's something that I'm having fun with and I'd like to do again, we'll just keep going.
[396:26.89]I'll do them all.
[396:32.48]Because games like that, I like games like that, that give the breaks in them that are more of a hangout session where we can just kind of talk about whatever the fuck we want.
[396:44.67]They're fun.
[396:47.75]Freudian Weapon, thanks for $2.50 again.
[396:50.07]Here's some more bits to fuel your obsession with money.
[396:52.34]And they say LUL.
[396:58.58]Thank you.
[397:01.52]Go to a fortune teller in Vegas?
[397:07.38]See, that's the kind of IRL stream I want to do.
[397:09.30]I want to do like, go get psychoanalyzed, go get your fortune told.
[397:14.91]That's the kind of IRL you'll see on this stream.
[397:18.69]Taking a lie detector, right?
[397:25.12]Uh... AdventureMFDan, thanks for the $5.
[397:28.00]Hey Jerma, I just got back from a trip from Vegas and I gotta say there was a severe lack of you impersonators.
[397:35.53]I stood on the strip for hours yelling Jerma985, but nothing happened.
[397:41.11]Love you, bud.
[397:43.77]No, not very many Jerma impersonators.
[397:47.84]I don't think very many people would want a picture with me.
[397:56.55]But thank you, hope you had fun.
[397:58.27]Vegas is a very fun city, lots to do.
[398:00.65]Tons to do.
[398:03.03]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the $5, Gnarly62.
[398:05.09]Five bucks.
[398:08.35]Hey Jerma, love your content, thanks for being funny for the last five years.
[398:11.41]Hopefully that doesn't change.
[398:12.91]You make me laugh, little streamer.
[398:17.26]I... hope you still think it's fun and funny.
[398:23.06]I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing.
[398:26.32]changing it up every now and then, adding things, trying new things.
[398:30.98]I hope you still do think it's interesting.
[398:36.59]Here's to another few years.
[398:38.17]Five years.
[398:38.77]Here's to another five years.
[398:39.83]Let's see what happens.
[398:44.84]Don't you dare stop being funny.
[398:51.00]I'm just gonna keep doing me.
[398:54.10]And if that means people think it's cool and fun, then... I'm gonna keep doing it.
[399:01.72]I don't really know how to beat anybody else.
[399:05.14]There you go.
[399:09.23]Uh, we also... Jerma's Average Dong and a bunch of other people gave a ton of community subs.
[399:18.41]I think there were, like, more than a couple... There was, like, 150, 200 community subs just tonight.
[399:24.90]So that's out of fucking control.
[399:26.88]I'm sure when we do the credits here in a second, you'll see.
[399:31.46]They are probably going to scorch by.
[399:34.94]Why don't we take a look?
[399:36.36]Here are all the new subs and resubs tonight.
[399:38.82]And here they go.
[399:43.69]Sometimes this goes so fast.
[399:48.37]And here it comes.
[399:49.45]I'm going to read them all.
[399:52.29]I used to try to do that.
[399:55.01]Thank you, everybody.
[399:56.38]Thank you for the huge amount of community subs.
[399:58.50]Not even community subs.
[399:59.68]If you still... If you just subbed to the channel for some reason.
[400:05.00]You know, it's not just about the community subs.
[400:07.14]It's about everybody.
[400:09.34]A lot of you guys have been subbed on your own for fucking three, four years.
[400:15.02]That's a long time to be supporting somebody and their channel.
[400:20.28]And some of you guys just decided you were going to sub today because you wanted to.
[400:24.03]Thanks.
[400:30.51]That means a lot.
[400:31.49]I hope you still think it's fun.
[400:34.71]And I hope as the months progress, I hope you still think it's worth paying for.
[400:40.99]Thank you.
[400:45.78]We also had $4.
[400:46.94]$4 from Tank, Mr. Skeletal, for the $4.
[400:53.60]Yo Jermbo, just wanted to let you know I've been a fan since 2012 and I'm leaving for basic training on Tuesday.
[401:00.05]And your streams have helped me with the stress and anxiousness I've been dealing with lately.
[401:04.17]Thanks to my heart.
[401:07.11]I wish you the best of luck.
[401:10.28]Take care.
[401:17.10]Much love to you.
[401:20.24]Thank you for being part of this community for so long.
[401:24.50]We look forward to when you come back.
[401:33.65]Thank you for the $4.
[401:35.81]Sorry, $5, actually.
[401:43.15]As I said, also, I hope you have fun on vacation with your mom.
[401:46.50]jermaHeart.
[401:47.46]Thank you.
[401:56.42]I'll say it again.
[401:57.98]Much love to you.
[402:00.40]Take care of yourself.
[402:07.92]And thank you again for being a part of the community for that long.
[402:11.50]That means a fucking ton.
[402:17.99]Good luck at basic training.
[402:22.87]We have a few more come in.
[402:24.05]We have... $5.10 from... PH from Frike?
[402:30.95]From Pike?
[402:31.85]Mr. Pike?
[402:33.97]We won't forget...
[402:37.20]What are we not forgetting?
[402:45.68]We won't forget.
[402:46.48]What are we not forgetting?
[402:52.11]Oh, you!
[402:52.79]You!
[402:53.33]Oh, okay.
[402:53.77]Right, right, right.
[402:54.37]Okay.
[402:56.03]I forgot!
[402:56.97]Oh, shit.
[402:57.39]I forgot about me.
[403:02.58]No, I don't, I don't take, I mean, I think the longest, besides October.
[403:07.22]Because October was all the internet problems and moving across the country, right?
[403:12.62]So I was gone for like, you know, in that balloon.
[403:16.70]I was gone for like three weeks.
[403:18.97]But before that, I'm not sure I've ever, at least streaming-wise...
[403:25.37]For the last three or four years.
[403:26.39]I'm not sure I've ever been away for that long.
[403:28.42]For more than like four or five, six days in a row.
[403:31.26]Maybe a convention or something.
[403:33.66]So it'll be nice to kind of take some time.
[403:35.28]You know, everybody needs time.
[403:42.79]Doesn't matter who you are.
[403:55.62]Yeah, when am I gonna come back?
[403:57.52]Probably Friday night is when I will stream again.
[404:02.64]So, like, this coming next, like, Friday before the weekend.
[404:07.12]And I'll be, I'll be live Friday, uh, the 26th.
[404:13.20]Oh, wait, that's, wait, that's fucking... I ain't gonna see that movie on opening night.
[404:21.41]No, we're gonna do, like, a I'm not seeing Endgame stream.
[404:31.63]Because I don't go to movies on opening night.
[404:33.29]I go, like, later.
[404:37.69]And that stream is going to be in, like, fucking question marks only mode.
[404:45.04]We are locking that on, because I'm seeing it in, like, a day after that or so.
[404:48.88]We're going to be in, like, exclamations and, like, dot, you know what I mean?
[404:55.91]We're going to be in, like, this mode.
[404:57.81]Or you can only do symbols mode.
[405:01.07]for that whole string.
[405:05.77]Not even emotes.
[405:06.45]Somebody's gonna put together spoilers with emotes.
[405:09.52]They will put together a string of like 15 spoilers as emotes.
[405:14.10]They'll do it somehow.
[405:16.10]People are smart and they're clever on this platform.
[405:18.63]They'll do it.
[405:22.02]Yeah, like, somebody will do a string of, like, emotes like that, like sawdust bunny, right?
[405:28.10]It'll be, like, 12, 15 emotes long.
[405:31.09]Mm-mm.
[405:31.59]Nope.
[405:32.01]Symbols only on Friday.
[405:40.38]Jerma lied about Gway.
[405:41.60]Thanks for the $5.
[405:42.70]Love you, Jerry.
[405:44.08]Thank you, Gway.
[405:45.44]Appreciate it.

[406:29.18]I'm able to do that because you guys watch.
[406:36.81]And I don't like to treat this like work.
[406:42.66]It's not, I don't treat this like a business.
[406:45.62]As much as it's to, you know, potential ups or downs financially, right?
[406:49.86]If I treat it like a business, maybe, oh, I'd make more money or something, but I don't want to treat it like a business.
[406:57.89]You're fired.
[406:58.66]Fuck!
[407:00.08]This was the interview!
[407:07.10]But no, I'm forever grateful that I'm about to have my mother come into my new city and take her around and enjoy the town and hang out with her for a week.
[407:20.39]That's only possible because of you.
[407:22.25]And I'm talking about you.
[407:24.97]Yeah, you.
[407:28.23]That's right.
[407:31.56]But thank you, Aeroparadox.
[407:33.66]You mean gamble?
[407:34.52]No, my mother doesn't gamble.
[407:37.24]And neither do I. It's fucking... It's stupid.
[407:40.58]Why would you ever do that?
[407:42.02]No.
[407:42.46]My mother doesn't gamble and neither do I. I eat celery.
[407:50.31]And drink pineapple juice.
[407:52.55]I don't do anything else.
[407:56.19]I sit in a chair and I eat celery.
[407:58.21]I'm a good boy.
[408:06.35]You just said you lost 100 bucks at roulette.
[408:12.65]Nah, that's not me.
[408:14.75]I've changed.
[408:17.23]As of yesterday, I sit there and I eat celery and I fucking read books.
[408:27.72]Reformed.
[408:30.96]No, I'm just fucking around.
[408:33.60]But thank you, Shalashka, for the 250.
[408:36.17]Hey, Jerma.
[408:38.65]King Roger came back and has started a therapy hotline to talk with people about their issues and help them.
[408:44.62]I don't know if this is crazy, but I think you're really good at giving advice.
[408:49.64]Perhaps you could collab.
[408:51.34]You seem like the kind of person who likes to help people.
[408:54.37]That's awesome that they're doing that.
[408:57.63]But I've said the same thing about collaborations I've said in the past.
[409:01.34]They just kind of happen.
[409:02.40]I usually just do my own thing on this platform and on any platform.
[409:08.42]Collaborations are, they just sort of organically will happen with people that I, you know, randomly talk to or come across or, hey, there's a project that I'd like to do.
[409:17.67]I don't really plan out my collaborations.
[409:24.59]But that's pretty awesome that they're doing that.
[409:34.32]A lone rat is what he is.
[409:36.54]Rat solo.
[409:38.22]For the most part, yeah.
[409:41.52]And we've gone over whole 20-30 minute segments of streams where I've talked about why.
[409:47.63]Not to be like a broken record or anything.
[409:50.45]But, yeah.
[409:53.89]Good for them, though.
[409:54.35]That's fucking great.
[409:56.21]Do a cooking stream.
[409:59.77]Summer.
[410:01.01]Summer is gonna have so much shit on this channel.
[410:02.77]You have no idea.
[410:05.23]Summertime is gonna be, like, there's gonna be so many fucking things that are gonna be streamed.
[410:09.86]I can't wait.
[410:12.84]It's gonna be great.
[410:14.78]It's gonna be so much fun.
[410:16.92]CoolerSniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[410:18.26]Enjoy your vacation.
[410:20.76]I will.
[410:22.67]I definitely will.
[410:25.85]Tyler Mike, thanks for the 250.
[410:26.84]That's what I love about you and Vinny, you don't treat us like a business opportunity, you treat us like family, just hanging out playing video games.
[410:37.84]Yeah, I mean, and look, when I started doing this, on YouTube and Twitch, I don't wanna, I don't care about fucking, like, making a bunch of money that I'm already making a bunch of money.
[410:55.85]You know what I mean?
[410:56.43]Like, I don't care.
[410:57.37]That's not, and it doesn't do it for me.
[411:03.09]Like, I don't, like it, I would rather have people enjoy the streams and want to be part of the community than turn everybody into these money churning numbers that I present to fucking companies and present to people to make as much money as I possibly can.
[411:21.60]I don't care about that.
[411:23.74]I never have and I never will.
[411:24.84]I'm just the person that I am.
[411:28.20]I'm not going to say that streaming and turning your stream into a business and treating it like a business and trying to make a bunch of money on your business is wrong or bad.
[411:38.57]It's just something I don't do.
[411:44.49]Because when I used to watch stuff...
[411:48.88]I didn't want to be treated as a viewer, as a number that was just kind of a way to make somebody money.
[411:56.79]You know, I wanted to be like, oh, this is a place I like to watch and hang out, and I don't even want you guys to feel like you're being used to make me more money.
[412:11.11]And it's not like, and I know a lot of people have said that that wouldn't be the case, but I don't even know where the hell I would start with that.
[412:28.37]Yeah, the way that I've answered that question and talked about that is kind of like what you're saying, is instead of it being you and I are here and we're friends, it's all of us are here.
[412:53.57]It's not a you and I scenario.
[412:56.79]It's a collective community of people.
[413:00.69]That all are here and we're all around for the same things.
[413:11.52]We are many.
[413:12.76]You are vessel.
[413:14.48]But that's kind of true though.
[413:16.62]You know, that's kind of the way it is.
[413:18.15]That's the way it kind of should be.
[413:20.85]We are all collectively here.
[413:23.76]We are venom.
[413:25.86]We are venom.
[413:27.83]I'm pretty good at that, too.
[413:29.11]I've been pretty good at making impressions today.
[413:32.75]Don't view yourself as a vessel.
[413:33.95]No, I mean, I know that's a joke, but... I'd rather us collectively enjoy things than have it be a personal one-on-one you-and-I relationship.
[413:50.69]I think it's healthier that way.
[414:01.12]But, to put a cap on that conversation, no, I... I treat this the same way I treated this when I started making YouTube videos.
[414:08.07]Let's start with A, B, and C. A. Do I want to do this today?
[414:15.19]No.
[414:16.43]Then I'm not gonna do it.
[414:17.07]I'll see you tomorrow.
[414:19.52]Do I want to do this today?
[414:21.22]Am I, like, do I have something planned?
[414:22.50]Do I have something I want to do?
[414:23.40]Do I have something fun to try?
[414:24.58]Yes.
[414:25.26]Yeah, then let's go.
[414:26.40]B.
[414:31.86]No, no, no, no.
[414:32.72]I'm not saying, like, that's the end.
[414:33.96]Like, no.
[414:34.54]I'm saying, like, on a day-to-day basis, week-to-week basis.
[414:42.25]It's not like, do I want to do this?
[414:44.15]No.
[414:44.63]Not, like, the whole thing as a whole.
[414:48.77]No, you're stuck in ABC.
[414:53.65]No, it's like, do I want to do this?
[414:54.99]Will I have fun?
[414:55.73]And am I currently having fun while I'm doing it?
[414:59.07]You know, I've answered that question.
[415:01.43]Each stream.
[415:02.13]I sit here.
[415:03.98]Before a stream starts.
[415:07.20]The day before.
[415:08.26]Two days before.
[415:08.90]What do I want to do?
[415:10.24]What could be fun?
[415:10.86]Let's try that.
[415:11.86]Do I want to do that?
[415:13.24]Yeah.
[415:13.66]Alright, let's go.
[415:14.20]Let's do it.
[415:23.78]You sit here for two... I sit in the chair for two days.
[415:28.54]Don't move and I just end up falling asleep my chin hits my chest and I fucking fall asleep and I wake up screaming Okay, what are we doing?
[415:42.96]Yeah, sometimes it's like a detriment right like for instance like I built a birdhouse on this stream I just somebody was like wouldn't that be fun?
[415:49.02]It's I don't I'm gonna fucking do it.
[415:50.50]I'm gonna do that.
[415:51.30]I don't give a shit Well, that's what we're doing
[415:54.27]Even if it might not be, like, the best idea if I build a labo while drunk.
[416:00.23]It's just, I'm gonna do it.
[416:03.23]Nothing else is in that equation besides, does that sound like fun to me?
[416:09.77]Do the ideas land completely every time?
[416:12.68]No, that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop doing them.
[416:16.14]Absolutely not.
[416:23.91]I've been watching the archive.
[416:25.11]My first livestream was the gamer birdhouse stream.
[416:35.01]VRJosh, thanks a lot, man.
[416:36.44]Like, that... Imagine that's your first stream.
[416:45.72]Yeah, but that's...
[416:48.97]I want it to be fun because I want to have fun too, you know?
[416:52.09]It's really... It's a symbiotic relationship as a collective unit of people.
[416:59.56]Because I want to have fun too.
[417:01.90]I want to turn on this stream and I want to do something fun and I want to interact and come up with shit and play off you guys.
[417:08.38]What you guys are saying.
[417:09.52]You guys having fun.
[417:10.32]That's why I do this.
[417:21.57]We go over this frequently, right?
[417:23.39]Because... I obviously want to make sure I'm holding up that end of the bargain, too.
[417:28.56]Frequently.
[417:29.22]And we have discussions and talk about... Hey, stay to the channel.
[417:32.06]How are things going?
[417:34.44]I never wanted to be... A bunch of people that are like... No, this sucks now.
[417:38.14]I don't like it.
[417:39.75]How would I want that?
[417:40.59]I don't want you to say that, like, for real.
[417:42.55]And I know, like, we're gonna see it right now.
[417:44.41]It's gonna be like, oh, this sucks, right?
[417:46.80]Right, I know, I know.
[417:48.54]But I don't want that to be the case.
[417:51.00]And when that gets to be the case, that means I'm probably not fucking having fun anymore.
[417:57.23]And I'm doing it because I just to do it.
[418:01.27]I'm doing it because I fucking like I have to, right?
[418:03.59]No, no.
[418:04.19]I want this to stay just how it is.
[418:06.67]I'm having fun.
[418:07.41]Are you having fun?
[418:09.13]Do we have any interesting things we want to do?
[418:11.57]Yeah, let's do them.
[418:18.04]And that's the way it is.
[418:18.68]That's the way it's going to continue to be.
[418:21.02]Because that's the only way that I can stream.
[418:22.38]That's it.
[418:23.10]I can't do it.
[418:23.52]I can't do it any other way.
[418:32.13]But we got two more bits to do.
[418:36.08]Or one more, actually.
[418:36.78]But that was Tyler Mike for 250.
[418:39.76]And I talked about Vinny, too.
[418:40.68]And Vinny has been, at least in this kind of sense...
[418:45.31]Um, that's been very inspirational to me, the way that Vinny treats his Twitch channel.
[418:50.51]When I was just starting out, you know, I had a YouTube audience, I had a large YouTube audience, right?
[418:55.42]We moved over here to Twitch, and I was looking around, who's who, and who's doing what, and what are they doing?
[419:01.12]And the whole, like, Vinny doesn't treat his fans like money numbers, and doesn't read subs, and I'm like, that's interesting, that's... Why, you know, why is that?
[419:12.97]So that's one of the reasons why I like Vinny a lot, you know, he's... He gets it, you know?
[419:21.23]Large?
[419:22.33]With quotes?
[419:22.83]What are you talking about?
[419:23.45]Hey, Castle Griffin State has like fucking 2 million views.
[419:26.73]Jerma Rumble Live Action got like a million views.
[419:30.55]I'm a million view YouTuber.
[419:32.30]I can say that.
[419:35.76]Grab That Auto 5 has like 6 million views.
[419:38.80]I'm a million view YouTuber.
[419:41.30]I can say that.
[419:42.08]I've been on the front page of Reddit more than once.
[419:46.42]I'm a million view streamer.
[419:48.04]I mean, a million view.
[419:49.70]I'm a million view YouTuber and front page of Reddit video maker.
[419:53.59]That's on my resume.
[419:54.41]I swear to God, I'll pull it up right now.
[420:04.53]he's gonna be the grandpa's gonna be doing this you should have seen when I was young I had four videos get to the front page of reddit with 10 000 upvotes on them what do you do now can somebody turn grandpa around he's talking at the wall again just spin him around
[420:37.35]largest youtube community just ask anybody all fantastic people tremendous videos very high quality I I know what that is and like it's
[420:52.84]largest YouTube community.
[420:54.26]Just ask anybody.
[420:55.66]All fantastic, fantastic people.
[420:57.90]Tremendous videos.
[420:59.09]Very high quality videos.
[421:00.93]Just great.
[421:01.53]Absolutely beautiful.
[421:03.51]Tremendous channel.
[421:09.25]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[421:11.59]But all jokes aside, though, I did came over here with a group of people that were watching the YouTube videos and we started streaming and I didn't know who any of these people were.
[421:20.48]I knew some of them were just because they were so popular or so famous to begin with that everybody just knows their name, right?
[421:28.06]But no, that's... Vinny's a great streamer.
[421:32.48]Vinny's a great dude.
[421:34.22]Hung out with him multiple times.
[421:38.32]Yeah.
[421:44.07]But with that, Internet Jorge, thanks for the $15.
[421:48.64]$15 coming in.
[421:51.08]Love you lots, Jeremy.
[421:51.82]You really are one of the most genuine and amazing streamers around.
[421:54.40]Give your mother a kiss from me.
[421:58.66]I will.
[422:09.09]Thank you.
[422:16.58]Have you seen the clip of Vinny saying that he highly respects you?
[422:21.38]Yeah, I mean, we have... That's fucking incredible to hear that, right?
[422:25.52]Like, it's... Anytime somebody sends me a clip of somebody saying something like that, I internalize it.
[422:32.03]And I go, is that real?
[422:34.47]I want to make sure that's actually... Is that true?
[422:38.51]Can I do better?
[422:40.39]I'm always striving to do better.
[422:44.31]And it's...
[422:55.33]It's an amazing feeling, knowing that there's other people that think so highly of you, but I want to keep myself grounded as well, because I want to make sure that I can keep doing the things that people like about the channel.
[423:09.34]And I think that if you get too much into your own head about it, that's how you start to have... you can really get in your own way.
[423:25.44]But no, it means a lot.
[423:26.34]It's... It means a lot.
[423:43.43]Close this out.
[423:44.27]We got like a... Why do I have so many tabs open?
[423:50.39]But it is 2 a.m.
[423:51.83]Pacific.
[423:52.59]I'm keeping so many people.
[423:54.59]It's very late for all of you.
[423:59.73]There's still a thousand people.
[424:01.62]I'm not sure where you are.
[424:02.36]If you're just waking up.
[424:05.22]Or if you're just going to bed.
[424:07.74]Have a great one.
[424:10.44]I will see you guys next weekend.
[424:12.62]I'm going to take some time off.
[424:15.68]Vacation.
[424:17.48]I'm going to stream Legends Feed, everybody.
[424:24.08]Take care of yourselves, guys.
[424:25.46]Don't forget about me.
[424:26.18]I'm still around.
[424:26.72]I'll probably pop in the Discord and give you like a mom update, you know?
[424:32.45]I'm going to do stream legends and then we're going to bed.
[424:41.16]Keep an eye on the sus.
[424:42.64]I will update it to the day... I would keep an eye... Put your ear to the ground somewhere around like Wednesday or Thursday of this coming next week.
[424:55.28]Because then I'll have a good indicator of exactly when I'll be live again.
[424:58.32]Probably Friday.
[425:03.47]But you'll see a good indicator around Wednesday or Thursday.
[425:06.41]Let me get to...
[425:12.12]Streamlabs.
[425:13.12]Not Streamlabs.

[425:35.11]We doing good?
[425:39.00]Are we like one of the highest guild levels on the platform?
[425:41.90]We better be.
[425:43.52]I've been dumping gifts here.
[425:48.74]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[425:51.60]The guild is falling apart.
[425:52.99]What?
[425:55.03]Alright, this is gonna be the last thing you guys hear me say for a week.
