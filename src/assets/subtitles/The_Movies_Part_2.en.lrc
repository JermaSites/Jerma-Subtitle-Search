[00:29.94]News flash.
[00:31.03]An attempt to climb Everest ended in tragedy today when British adventurer Sir Toxteth Smythe Smith O'Reilly died just inches from the peak's summit after suffering a fatal nosebleed.
[00:44.67]The upside of all this is that the coast's now clear for one of our boys to conquer the mountain first instead.
[00:53.08]Hi.
[00:57.00]Yeah, I'm not quite ready to go.
[00:59.92]I was in the process of building my park.
[01:03.28]My theme park.
[01:04.90]My movie studio.
[01:05.78]Get it right.
[01:06.22]Gosh darn it.
[01:08.36]Movie hype.
[01:09.62]That's right.
[01:09.96]We're going to try to make some movies tonight.
[01:11.30]I don't know how many we're going to get through, but we're going to try to make as many as we can.
[01:17.11]But I'll be right back.
[01:18.03]Give me one minute.
[01:18.69]I just want to grab my phone and we'll get started.
[01:32.57]So I said to him, I'll kill you if you look at my wife again.
[01:35.81]And I hit him with about a... Oh, are we on air?
[01:40.00]Uh, we'll be back after this.
[01:48.74]Your attention, please.
[01:50.36]A star from Arrival Studio has just joined our stage school line.
[02:20.81]Yeah.
[03:02.23]Here's a word of advice from KMVS.
[03:05.02]Buy a car.
[03:06.39]They're the future.
[03:32.17]I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.
[04:10.06]There we are.
[04:13.08]Good evening.
[04:13.80]Happy Thursday.
[04:15.36]Welcome.
[04:19.85]My name is Jerma.
[04:20.75]We're going to be playing some movies.
[04:25.33]Let me turn this down.
[04:29.95]Alright, let me just do one more thing real quick.
[04:36.61]Instant Movie is on.
[04:39.09]I remade the park.
[04:43.16]Don't have to worry about that tonight.
[04:46.04]Connecting to Apple TV.
[04:47.20]What the fuck is my phone doing?
[04:52.80]Hold on a second.
[05:13.36]Wait, what?
[05:15.56]What?
[05:18.06]So I've been watching people play Final Fantasy XV.
[05:21.56]Is that game any good?
[05:23.76]It looks like it's kind of fun.
[05:25.40]Should I get it or should I not get it?
[05:26.58]Okay.
[05:36.33]Wait, what?
[05:37.41]Let me get my ass in the right fucking spot.
[05:40.55]Why is there a blanket down here?
[05:41.75]It doesn't make any sense.
[05:45.19]Should I put the blanket on my legs?
[05:46.67]They're kind of chilly.
[05:52.11]Get it?
[05:54.53]Okay, here we go.
[05:56.95]This... Alright, so... The park is pretty much already built.
[06:07.11]I kind of just need to... Make the movies at this point.
[06:13.21]This is the expansion.
[06:14.01]It's all installed.
[06:14.83]The stunts and effects.
[06:16.37]Let me get this right.
[06:19.13]The movie's stunts and effects expansion pack.
[06:22.97]What this adds is apparently like... Shit can light on fire now.
[06:29.08]There's like chase scenes, car scenes.
[06:30.70]There's a lot of shit to add.
[06:33.80]So let's fucking just do it.
[06:35.90]I'm not going to waste any goddamn time.
[06:42.47]These are all new actors.
[06:44.63]We're going to see what the fuck we can do.
[06:48.85]Oh, nice.
[06:49.19]The director of 8th edition is still around.
[06:52.28]Technically, I guess.
[06:55.72]We're going to try to tap into our creative spectrum here.
[07:01.50]We're going to make a new movie.
[07:03.16]This one's going to have stunts.
[07:07.08]8th edition 2.
[07:11.41]No 8th edition 2.
[07:13.31]Not yet, at least.
[07:14.01]We're going to try something simple.
[07:17.88]Let's go with an action movie.
[07:21.76]Because I want to just get a feel for the new stuff in the expansion.
[07:29.00]So this is going to be like a car chase.
[07:30.80]We're just going to do a very simple car movie.
[07:35.75]Guy, girl drives car.
[07:38.51]They get pulled over, and it's like a Bonnie and Clyde.
[07:41.33]They try to escape.
[07:44.12]So here we go.
[07:44.48]We're going to call it... Catch Me If You Can.
[07:50.28]No, that's like an Elijah Wood movie.
[07:52.86]Or what's his name?
[07:55.96]Abernathy?
[07:57.23]Leonardo DiCaprio.
[07:59.09]Uh...
[08:11.13]Far away.
[08:11.95]Gas is the limit.
[08:13.41]Action movie.
[08:15.35]Our lead actress.
[08:16.57]Okay, we want to, yeah.
[08:17.23]We're going to have them in different costumes here.
[08:23.30]No, it can't be fucking apes.
[08:26.56]I really don't want to do apes again.
[08:34.26]Should they be in spacesuits?
[08:39.84]Fart jokes incoming.
[08:40.89]No, no fart jokes.
[08:44.51]Are they going to be in like fucking World War II uniforms?
[08:50.31]Uh, sure.
[08:53.35]Here's our first actress.
[08:55.99]Here's the supporting actor.
[08:57.32]Okay.
[09:02.16]There's going to be a werewolf.
[09:04.10]No chicken suit, no apes.
[09:05.64]They've already showed up at least a couple times.
[09:10.16]And somebody in a bathrobe.
[09:18.24]Fat lady.
[09:19.71]Fat old lady.
[09:22.11]Don't know what you're going to be doing, but you'll be doing something.
[09:26.57]Freeform editing.
[09:27.71]Far away.
[09:28.35]Gas is the limit.
[09:29.23]No, no.
[09:29.83]Gas is the limit.
[09:32.28]That just sounds like a badly translated title.
[09:42.85]No, fucking gas is the limit.
[09:46.41]Here we go.
[09:47.17]We have a bunch of new scenes to work with.
[09:50.97]The expansion's installed.
[09:52.45]Wild West traveling vehicle.
[09:55.81]We have automobile traveling vehicle.
[09:58.24]It starts off... How's it going to start off, guys?
[10:04.16]Dress up my extras.
[10:05.24]There's no extras in this one.
[10:06.28]We're just getting a feel for it.
[10:10.66]There's going to be three actors in this movie.
[10:14.92]I'm going to start in the automobile.
[10:19.29]Gas is the limit three.
[10:20.49]Okay.
[10:26.29]There's a lot here.
[10:28.71]It's definitely going to start with like it opens up and she's like smashes the gear change.
[10:38.09]That's way too fast.
[10:44.07]Fine, yeah, that's fine.
[10:49.55]Alright, starts with that, and then... Now we're gonna have them... We're gonna have the car speed off.
[10:59.30]The car just crashes immediately.
[11:03.88]No, no, wait, wait, wait.
[11:06.00]We can't have the car crash immediately.
[11:09.48]Maybe we can.
[11:12.34]Should the car just fucking crash?
[11:16.57]Why are these two in the car together?
[11:17.89]I'm not sure.
[11:25.03]And then it ends.
[11:25.85]No.
[11:26.45]No, no, no, no.
[11:27.13]I'm going to keep that there for now.
[11:31.66]No, no, no.
[11:32.06]I'm going to move this forward.
[11:33.14]We're going to do automobile.

[30:47.45]I don't know why this is his costume.
[30:53.96]Wait.
[30:54.16]Speaking of costume.
[30:54.86]Let me look at that one more time.

[31:20.92]I have no idea what it was.
[31:22.54]We're going to keep that.
[31:24.92]I think she's going to speed off.
[31:34.33]Oh, no.
[31:34.69]It would just be...
[31:43.64]Hold on, the car.
[31:45.60]Car, no, not chase.
[31:47.16]Fuck.
[31:48.30]He can't be in the car again.
[31:49.58]Although she does look concerned there.
[31:54.12]Okay, hold on.
[32:07.34]Get him out of the car.
[32:08.88]He can't be in this.
[32:12.48]She needs to just speed off.
[32:21.40]OK, what the hell?
[32:22.74]A traveling vehicle.
[32:24.51]Wild West.

[32:55.61]Okay, that looks good.
[32:56.77]And, of course, at the very end, at the very end, she's just gonna crash.
[33:11.39]Except like this guy's in it again for some reason.
[33:13.30]No, I'm going to move the camera much closer to her.
[33:22.86]Alright.

[36:20.12]We had a couple of burps too while we were at it.
[36:28.61]Just in case you weren't sure what they were doing.
[36:43.11]They already get in an accident and then they beep.

[51:48.40]Oh, boy.
[51:49.06]Okay, hold on.
[51:49.72]No.
[51:49.82]No.
[51:53.82]What are these fucking costumes?
[51:57.90]This is fine, right here.
[51:59.58]He's also a fat guy.
[52:00.50]Okay, this is the murderer, so they always have to be in their murderer costume, which is what, like... Chicken murderer?
[52:18.48]Vampire?
[52:22.92]No, not the werewolf.
[52:24.94]The gorilla?
[52:25.80]No, it's the mummy.
[52:26.68]Of course it's the mummy.
[52:33.26]He said it's very critical.
[52:41.57]Untransformed werewolf?
[52:43.85]Alright, fine.
[52:44.67]It'll be the gorilla.
[52:46.01]This is gonna be so stupid.

[52:58.37]That's a terrible movie monster.
[53:03.22]And the supporting actress is going to be... It doesn't... Whatever.
[53:09.26]You can be anything.
[53:10.36]I don't care.
[53:10.78]I'm not going to put you in a World War II... Wild West dress.
[53:14.93]Whatever.
[53:16.39]You're also fat.
[53:19.07]Okay.
[53:19.83]We have our cast.
[53:22.05]Red Dutch.
[53:24.16]Alright, so these people aren't going to exist.
[53:30.19]He's just reading his novel.
[53:34.23]His romance novel that he's really into.
[53:35.89]Okay.
[53:39.43]And then in fucking breaks the murderer.
[53:48.45]Pick up weapon.
[53:49.21]The door just gets smashed down.
[53:53.82]With the axe.
[53:54.32]I think I can just type in axe.
[53:59.48]Axe door.
[54:00.38]Okay.
[54:08.31]These sounds are really cheesy.
[54:10.59]You'd think it'd be a little bit louder.
[54:11.73]Okay.
[54:18.31]That's fine.
[54:21.65]Next scene is same thing.
[54:27.75]Enter axe.
[54:35.48]No, he just broke that door down.
[54:39.02]Wait, I can't change that?
[54:43.98]No, he fucking just smashed this door down.
[54:46.24]He needs to be, like, interior, not exit.
[54:47.92]It's gotta be interior.
[54:52.94]Shack?
[54:53.24]Okay, shack interior.
[54:54.30]There we go.
[54:56.53]And it's right, where is it?
[54:57.85]It's axe again, right?
[55:02.90]Yeah, axe the door.
[55:03.62]Because now we're inside.

[120:54.40]I'll take you all to die!
[120:55.42]What do you think?
[121:01.20]What do you think?
[121:02.65]I forgot about you?
[121:03.17]You think I forgot about you?

[122:45.77]He was just reading a fucking stupid, he was reading a story.
[122:48.11]That's it.
[123:02.19]You can pinpoint exactly where things went to dog shit.
[123:04.87]I know.
[123:07.83]Shit's on the toilet, dude.
[123:08.93]That last, like, shit that changes frame.
[123:11.75]Okay, he he puts it in gear and steps on the gas and immediately pulls the parking brake Fucking god this guy loves this game.
[123:22.91]This game is too fun.
[123:35.84]I Didn't even know you could do that shit
[123:43.74]Ayayay.
[123:50.16]My god.
[123:51.34]Alright, let's go again.
[123:53.90]We need a new theme.
[123:54.78]We're doing like an action, like stunt movie.
[124:00.36]Alright!
[124:05.55]Well, I'll take this opportunity to say thanks to the people that have been subbing and stuff.
[124:11.43]Ugh.
[124:13.23]Holy shit.
[124:15.91]You just gave a fucking hundred bucks.
[124:19.83]Holy fuck.
[124:22.81]Air North with the 10,000 bits.
[124:26.73]My goodness, dude.
[124:27.55]Thank you for the 10,000.
[124:29.55]It's $100, man.
[124:31.09]Experimental garbage.
[124:32.40]No, it's just like I knew it was coming, too.
[124:35.30]Like, just the car crashes at the end.
[124:36.88]I knew they were coming.
[124:37.96]We just put them in there just to be fucking idiots.
[124:40.22]And it just makes me laugh every time.
[124:42.40]The fact that, like, imagine if that was a real movie.
[124:44.59]Imagine if that's, like, you were seeing that in the theaters.
[124:46.71]And, like, that happened.
[124:49.47]I thought we deleted the guy.
[124:50.85]Why were there two gorillas in there sometimes?
[124:55.67]But, thanks, man.
[124:56.67]Aronoth, that's really kind of you.
[124:58.70]Thanks for the hundred bucks, dude.
[125:02.18]Put these all on the main channel.
[125:04.50]God, imagine if I put these just back to back to back.
[125:06.76]Like, 12 minutes of these.
[125:10.85]Oh my god, but yeah, Aaron North, huge props to you, dude, thanks a lot, man.
[125:16.00]And while we're on that front, not only did Aaron North give a large amount of bits, but also Stortles with the 500 bits, thank you, Stortles.
[125:24.64]Somebody else did too, back there.
[125:26.76]Female Jesus gave 500.
[125:30.21]That's, oh, there's a fucking extreme horrific horror scene with some smooth jazz, just how loud the jazz music was, my god.
[125:38.72]That was just too much, but thank you, Female Jesus, for the 500.
[125:40.76]And then Joseph of Arimathea.
[125:44.55]Thank you for the 335, dude.
[125:47.77]And there's a bunch of people giving 100.
[125:48.67]The Man of Straw with 1,000.
[125:52.45]Do I think I'll ever go back to Fistful of Frags?
[125:55.05]It was one of the few games you don't suck at.
[125:58.72]Well, thank you for the thousand, dude.
[126:01.54]And, um... I played it fairly recently.
[126:05.46]I played it on a stream less than a year ago.
[126:11.52]You made me laugh harder than last night.
[126:13.26]My one complaint is there wasn't enough dogs.
[126:17.95]Yeah, that was an adventure.
[126:19.75]But there you are again, female Jesus.
[126:22.81]Thank you for the $2,500.
[126:23.29]That's $25.
[126:24.89]Thanks a lot.
[126:26.81]Ugh.
[126:28.11]But anybody else?
[126:28.64]Did I miss any other bits that were... Here we are.
[126:32.46]Uh, the man of straw.
[126:35.78]I got the man of straw.
[126:36.46]He's the one that asked about Fistful of Frags.
[126:38.16]Cigarette spaghetti with $1,000.
[126:38.96]Thanks for the $10.
[126:39.96]Did somebody say cigarette?
[126:41.14]I just did.
[126:42.72]Much appreciated, dude.
[126:43.39]Thanks for the $10, man.
[126:43.97]Ugh.
[126:49.11]And sub-wise, there were quite a few subs, actually.
[126:53.87]Hold on, let me just get out of this.
[126:54.94]I love that these movies are actually making money.
[126:59.36]That's funny to me.
[127:00.80]And all my people are getting very, very excited for the next one.
[127:06.69]We actually have to have a guy breaking through a window or something.
[127:12.42]But let's get some of these subs.
[127:13.98]There were a bunch that I kind of have the last, like, 20 minutes of.
[127:16.97]I got, like, zoned into working on that for the last, like, 20 minutes or so.
[127:20.85]But thank you, Captain Gobbles.

[129:24.39]I hope you guys are enjoying the stream.
[129:27.53]So, let's make another one.
[129:32.96]Yeah, I've been told to upload that to the main channel without any context at all.
[129:36.80]And, man, that would actually be kind of funny.
[129:41.26]People are gonna be so fucking mad at that, though.
[129:43.58]Can you imagine how mad people would get at that?
[129:46.55]We talked about this last night, but with that with no context... Is... Like, how dare you upload this shit?
[129:57.47]Shit.
[130:01.55]What about my five times bits?
[130:03.55]Well, here's the thing with bits, right?
[130:06.57]I kind of read out the ones that are more than 100 bits.
[130:12.02]Not because I don't appreciate people that give 100.
[130:15.16]But it's sometimes it can be a lot to read out.
[130:20.12]No one would be mad.
[130:20.88]Why would they be mad?
[130:21.60]Well, because like I promised people like high quality, extremely high quality production value content on that channel.
[130:35.27]Who would be angry at that?
[130:38.15]105 new minimum.
[130:43.00]Sellout streamer.
[130:43.88]No, I mean, you guys see sometimes like you'll see like the 100 bit thing pop up potentially like dozens of times.
[130:52.43]And it's hard to kind of go through and just say hi to everybody.
[130:56.69]but if you give a hundred or a thousand that's like I've never expected but it's highly appreciated so don't feel don't feel like I don't care that you're giving a hundred bits at a time because I do very much so alright let's do another one do you not call that quality
[131:26.11]Oh, you gave 500.
[131:26.85]How the fuck am I missing that then?
[131:28.83]I'm sorry.
[131:32.49]You're putting much effort into this.
[131:33.73]Alright, this one is going to... We're not going to go for comedy on this one.
[131:37.15]We're going for pure action.
[131:40.96]This one's going to be called... Sling it in.
[131:54.69]Sling it in Sector 7.
[132:01.42]Sci-fi?
[132:02.62]Let's do sci-fi.
[132:03.98]We haven't done any aliens or anything like that.
[132:06.68]Sling it in Sector 7.
[132:09.16]Let's get this guy again.
[132:10.44]This guy's happy.
[132:11.52]This guy's not happy, but who gives a shit?
[132:14.50]They're all unhappy, but who cares?
[132:21.86]No, no.
[132:22.34]Okay, here's the rule with this movie.
[132:23.66]You guys ready?
[132:26.47]No farts, no burps, no car crashes.
[132:31.45]Okay?
[132:33.67]No farts, no burps, no car crashes allowed.
[132:38.41]If you see me doing that, abruptly stop me.
[132:41.58]Do you remember the years passed us by?
[132:46.68]Ape Edition took years to make.
[132:48.06]It doesn't get any higher quality than that.
[132:50.26]Well, cigarette, it's... I might just do it and say, fuck it, who cares?
[132:55.85]Alright, this is sci-fi.
[132:56.81]We've got to have these people in sci-fi clothes.
[133:00.46]Are there no aliens?
[133:02.68]I figured, why would there be a sci-fi category without aliens?
[133:12.18]No farts, no views.
[133:19.67]Alright, these two are going on an adventure.
[133:23.46]And we gotta have a monster.
[133:24.54]There has to be a monster in every movie, apparently.
[133:28.14]This is like the closest thing we can come to.
[133:29.82]Like a scary alien or something.
[133:37.02]No, no more apes!
[133:38.92]We've done the ape thing like four times.
[133:44.23]Alright, I need to use one of these expansion places.
[133:52.60]Here's my money for a movie ticket.
[133:53.92]Thanks, Jeremykins.
[133:55.20]Haven't laughed so hard in a decade.
[133:57.54]Well, thank you, Kat Yusha.
[133:59.36]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[134:03.47]I'm happy.
[134:03.97]Here's the thing, right?
[134:05.19]I'm really happy that I'm enjoying myself as much as I am.
[134:09.43]I never expected I was going to like this this much.
[134:12.49]But this is a bunch of fun.
[134:15.58]Alright, where is it?
[134:17.61]But thank you again, Sim.
[134:19.17]That's very nice of you.
[134:20.01]Very kind of you.
[134:21.57]Starship Bridge.
[134:28.18]Okay, Starship Bridge.
[134:29.52]It's gonna open.
[134:30.16]We need a static shot first of space.
[134:34.44]Hold on.
[134:35.44]We're gonna go with... We're gonna try with this one.
[134:39.13]We're not gonna do any goofy dog shit.
[134:42.13]We're gonna try...
[134:48.29]Okay, we're gonna do asteroid belt like, you know, we're gonna get like a static shot All these people aren't gonna be here don't worry And we're gonna have Epic music play right there.
[135:03.20]It's gonna fade into this scene.
[135:06.64]I wish these people would shut the fuck up Okay, there needs to be a lot of extras
[135:17.02]Okay, we need some, like, crew.
[135:24.34]Wait, wait, wait, where'd you get the alien costume?
[135:25.91]Where'd you get this costume?
[135:29.15]Where did you get this?
[135:32.39]Huh?
[135:38.14]That is not on this list.
[135:43.32]I am confused.
[135:47.77]Anybody else as confused as I am?
[135:52.71]I want you to be like... What?
[135:54.97]You have to research packs to unlock it to use it yourself?
[136:02.52]Really?
[136:02.80]Hold on.
[136:03.60]You got my... You piqued my interest for a second here.
[136:08.92]That movie doesn't count.
[136:12.38]How do I... Where's the research?
[136:13.74]How do I research packs?
[136:16.36]It's like a facility I have to build?
[136:26.56]Is that like in finances or something?
[136:37.05]Studio charts.
[136:40.11]It's in the lab.
[136:45.40]What the fuck is the lab?
[136:46.46]Oh, that was one serious movie.
[136:51.29]Finances?
[136:51.95]No.
[137:02.63]Make a completely normal movie and then have it end with the gorilla reading a book again.
[137:08.98]Yeah, how do I research that?
[137:10.00]Because I kind of want to get those things, but thank you, Pajagallo.
[137:14.28]The 10 bucks, man.
[137:15.84]Much appreciated.
[137:16.66]There always has to be the gorilla reading the book.
[137:21.51]You have to hire them?
[137:23.49]Is that even possible?
[137:26.83]You got to play in a recent decade, so we just got to not be in the 50s, apparently.
[137:39.45]When does it end?
[137:40.01]Well, then we're going to make a western.
[137:43.34]We're going to make a western action movie.
[137:47.08]No fucking around.
[137:47.82]I'm going to try.
[137:53.20]So let's do it.
[137:55.89]Star Wars.
[137:57.05]We can recreate Star Wars.
[137:58.01]Alright, we're going to do an action.

[138:54.80]Cowboy.
[138:55.32]And a cowgirl.
[139:02.19]Clip of the gorilla reading the book should appear at the end of every stream from now on, no matter what the game is.
[139:11.01]I guess.
[139:13.86]Wild West.
[139:15.20]We're going to have multiple cowboys.
[139:18.72]Cowboys and cowgirls.
[139:21.42]Action.
[139:21.80]Spittooey Saloon.
[139:22.70]Alright.
[139:25.78]So this is going to start.

[139:28.60]Wild West Traveling Vehicle.
[139:31.14]Okay, static.
[139:31.74]It's going to be the train pulling into the station.
[139:33.42]We need...
[139:39.37]this shit to be moving.
[139:41.71]There we are.
[139:48.19]Oh, jeez.
[139:48.57]Fahrenheit 616.
[139:49.20]Can I see what this is?
[139:56.00]I'll pause these horses fucking sprinting in a circle.
[139:59.31]Fahrenheit 616 with a hundred bucks.
[140:01.47]Jeez, dude, thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[140:03.69]It says, Jerma, my psychological service dog died back in October and it's been really hard getting over his death.
[140:11.85]I'm really glad you're streaming so often, having so much fun.
[140:14.16]Your content makes it so easy to just stop thinking about the world for a while and have a ton of laughs.
[140:18.58]Keep it up, my friend.
[140:20.48]Well, I'm terribly sorry to hear that, dude.
[140:23.72]Oh, but
[140:25.84]I mean, we all love our animals, and I'm sure he meant a huge amount to you, especially because he was a service dog.
[140:31.60]So much love to you, dude.
[140:34.37]That's very kind of you to give me $100.
[140:37.13]And I'm going to be doing this for as long as I can, man.
[140:41.75]As long as I keep having fun and you guys are having fun, then I'm going to keep doing it.
[140:46.98]So keep your head up.
[140:50.78]And I hope to do this for much longer.
[140:54.26]Much love to you, dude.
[141:00.55]static where do we want to do what do we want to do this standing in place no look at this look at this chat this chat is look at you guys are fucking awesome giving those positive vibes man what do I do outside of youtube uh I eat food I relate too much
[141:31.08]Yeah, I mean, you guys, I'm sure you guys have been talking like in the chat.
[141:34.62]A lot of you guys probably have made friends with each other and some of you probably even hang out outside the streams.
[141:40.43]I see you guys in the chat sometimes talking and yeah.
[141:47.81]Get those positive vibes going.
[141:49.19]Because we're about to make a fucking great Wild West movie.
[141:58.43]This is a great opening shot, by the way.
[141:59.81]Can you imagine, like, the Wild West?
[142:01.29]Like... We're gonna do that same thing again.
[142:08.08]This time, I'm gonna change the shot.
[142:09.42]I'm gonna show you my... Fuck, I went to film school, guys.
[142:11.42]I went to fucking film college.
[142:13.42]You think I don't know where to put the camera?
[142:14.70]You think I don't know, like, where to fucking, like, do, like, an awesome close-up cut?
[142:28.49]Like right there.
[142:31.58]Make sure that they're running still.
[142:39.66]Look at that.
[142:41.10]We open up here.
[142:41.92]Look at that.
[142:45.46]Who's this?
[142:46.42]This is going to be the guy riding into town.
[142:48.52]This is going to be Brandon Miller making his way into town.
[142:51.16]I think it already was him.
[142:54.47]I minored in art.
[142:55.31]Yeah, I did.
[142:58.72]If I went to film college to explain the 180 rule, it's a sight line thing.
[143:02.73]Because if you break 180 degrees, then it looks like the person flipped what side of the screen they were on.
[143:09.01]It's why they film football from one side.
[143:13.41]If they filmed football from more than one side, you would think that they were running in two different directions.
[143:20.16]There you go.
[143:20.96]Did I get a pass?
[143:21.72]Did I get an A for that one?
[143:22.88]A plus?
[143:27.12]I think so.
[143:33.64]Alright, um, that's fine.
[143:35.75]Background moves.
[143:38.31]Well done.
[143:42.45]Look at this shot!
[143:44.01]This is gonna win me awards.
[143:49.98]If you did art in college, explain your emotes.
[143:51.84]I was an art minor.
[143:52.98]I was a minor in art because I didn't know what else to fucking minor in.
[143:59.46]Alright, that's the next scene.
[144:00.38]Again, they do this.
[144:05.65]driver mount driver dismounts exit stage left help enter stagecoach shoot pull up zoom one I wish there was a stagecoach crash god I would fucking love it okay this is gonna
[144:34.57]Alright, so we're going to cut from here.
[144:36.21]There's a conversation in here.
[144:41.49]The two actors are going to be angry about something.
[144:54.82]Let's see how that goes.
[144:56.54]I'm going to do the voices for this, don't worry.
[145:10.28]This is going to be great.
[145:13.70]I don't like that.
[145:14.30]I don't like that.
[145:16.90]Conversation.
[145:18.02]Left actor.
[145:18.76]Focus.
[145:19.24]Both actors.
[145:23.60]We're going to stay that cold.
[145:29.40]I'm telling you.
[145:33.85]I can't wait to steal the gold.
[145:35.43]This is going to be fun.
[145:36.11]Alright, so they pull up to the saloon.
[145:46.46]I don't have any stunts available.
[145:53.44]Is that because I'm not in the 60s yet or something?
[146:00.97]We need to like speed this up and get to like the fucking 60s.
[146:03.09]You know what I'm going to do?
[146:05.81]I wonder if I can make it go faster into the 60s.
[146:11.63]Because I think that's why I can't do stunts.
[146:18.96]Hold on just a minute.
[146:20.26]Let me see.
[146:27.56]Make the 2000s movie.
[146:31.38]You got to advance and research stuff.
[146:33.80]I mean, we're in 1950s costumes.
[146:37.22]Advanced horror.
[146:38.22]Goddamn.
[146:40.96]At least just take time.
[146:41.96]Is there like a time skip cheat?
[146:43.70]Does anybody know what the cheat is?
[146:44.99]If there is a cheat?
[146:45.59]Because I'll do it right now.
[146:49.83]Start in the 60s.
[146:50.63]I couldn't select it in sandbox mode.
[146:53.29]I can only start in the 1950s.
[146:59.27]Let me just go back.
[147:01.63]I didn't get very far in this anyway.
[147:02.91]Let me see something here.
[147:08.56]I'm going to save this.
[147:18.46]Is there a console?
[147:19.08]There's no console in this game, is there?
[147:22.76]Okay.
[147:23.44]Exit to main menu.
[147:28.60]game see like this is quick start jump straight into the 60s but it's not sandbox mode we have to like wait I can't like skip like new game skip tutorial no I mean I can do that but we're gonna have to wait for there's no fast forwarding really
[147:54.24]Because when I do sandbox, watch, ready?
[147:56.10]What year do I want to start at?
[147:57.16]I can only do 1950.
[147:58.02]I can't go past 1950.
[147:59.53]Because that's what I did last time.
[148:06.35]Like, see, stuntmen, like, I had all these things pretty much checked.
[148:16.72]See, like, click here to indicate that you want stunts and stuntmen enabled.
[148:20.44]But you have to get to, like, the 60s before you can even do it.
[148:29.43]Don't do it.
[148:31.56]Yeah, that's I mean, I guess they kind of didn't in the sandbox mode.
[148:34.36]They didn't retroactively change it.
[148:38.84]We could just do this.
[148:43.66]Press enter during game and type set set to unlock sets.
[148:52.58]Really?
[148:55.38]Is that true?
[148:58.42]Set set.
[149:01.36]Alright, give me the cheat codes, guys.
[149:02.58]We're cheating.
[149:06.04]Alright, let's see.
[149:11.66]I don't think that's doing anything.
[149:17.79]No, there's no developer console.
[149:19.57]Set set to set the sets.
[149:23.15]Let's just do the quick start one.
[149:27.45]Because that will put us at least in the 60s immediately.
[149:34.25]What a cheater.
[149:39.05]Yeah, we'll just do the quick start.
[149:40.91]And I'll just skip all this shit and we'll just go right to making our own script.
[149:52.20]If you start quick start and then go to sandbox.
[149:53.72]I already did that though.
[149:55.78]If I start quick start and then go to sandbox.
[149:58.02]I did the whole tutorial kind of in.
[150:01.84]Let's go.
[150:02.38]Let's just do it again.
[150:05.34]yeah yeah yeah who cares go back quick start uh wait I want to turn the previous menu main menu yeah open the game files uh let's just do quick start uh t rash studios
[150:41.01]Start with an empty lot?
[150:43.17]No.
[150:43.75]Just give me all this shit for free.
[150:47.29]Polar Autumn 201, thanks for the thousand bits, dude.
[150:50.06]Will I be doing anything Christmassy for Twitch?
[150:53.18]I don't know.
[150:55.20]Maybe.
[150:56.08]It depends.
[150:57.86]I did already do this, though, so I kind of understand how it works.
[151:01.72]Build a stunt school when you're ready to begin the stunts tutorial.
[151:06.18]This guy's going to really...
[151:09.36]Stunt school, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[151:12.44]Now we gotta wait for shit.
[151:14.62]God damn it.
[151:18.78]Edit the save in the game files to cheat.
[151:20.74]Alright, where's the custom script?
[151:26.58]Can I just do it immediately and just skip all this shit?
[151:28.68]I think I can.
[151:33.02]Script office.
[151:33.78]Advanced movie.
[151:34.28]Here we go.
[151:35.50]Fuck off.
[151:36.08]Fuck the tutorial.
[151:39.15]Alright, here we go.
[151:41.45]Hopefully we have it unlocked now.
[151:47.49]Just fast forward the sandbox.
[151:48.73]We'll be sitting there for a while.
[151:50.07]We have to sit there and fast forward like seven years.
[151:54.12]It's going to take like 25 minutes.
[151:56.26]We'll see if we can do it here.
[152:07.85]Okay, this guy, fine.
[152:09.25]Whatever.
[152:09.69]What can we do here?
[152:10.33]I got a fucking towel.
[152:17.17]Sure thing.
[152:19.45]Gotta do regedit.
[152:21.06]Regedit to change the game files.
[152:22.72]That sucks.
[152:27.08]Santa.
[152:33.82]And you.
[152:46.42]Wild West Sheriff.
[152:47.24]Alright.
[152:52.50]Action.
[152:53.26]Freeform.
[152:54.02]All-out war.
[152:54.76]Let's see what we can do now.
[152:57.36]Rural field.
[152:58.77]Bombed street.
[153:00.67]Alright.
[153:01.25]It's all-out war.
[153:02.83]Shabby hotel room.
[153:07.05]Okay.
[153:07.41]Let's just go with bombed street.
[153:11.67]Stunts.
[153:13.09]Oh, you fucking assholes.
[153:19.83]Covering fire.
[153:23.99]Medics arrive.
[153:25.35]Boarding helicopter.
[153:28.15]Gas tank explosion.
[153:29.77]Throw fire bomb.
[153:35.40]Why are stunts grayed out?
[153:36.96]Hold on, I might have to... What a pain in the ass.
[153:43.26]I think I have to actually build the studio and shit.
[153:46.00]Okay.
[153:46.14]Where's that casting office?
[154:08.94]As you can see from the script's stunt script, lead the script.
[154:11.98]Assign your new stuntman as the lead roles double by dropping them onto now.
[154:16.74]Assign the director and remaining cast members as usual.
[154:22.53]Going real fast through this shit.
[154:25.29]I need a roll and assign.
[154:27.85]Drop the script into the shoot-it room once rehearsals are finished.
[154:32.25]Sure thing.
[154:32.97]Oh, the actual game.
[154:34.83]I know.
[154:37.09]Probably fast forward this stuff
[154:39.96]Thank you JuicyBagel21, FoxoSoro, Grizzly1620, GokuDog, TreeFitty71, thanks for the new subs.
[154:50.17]Alright.
[154:52.03]Shoot it.
[154:53.31]Yeah, you can like fail the stunts and stuff like that.
[155:12.25]Get it going.
[155:14.75]Go, go, go.
[155:17.99]I wish sandbox mode actually meant sandbox mode.
[155:29.36]Ow.
[155:30.96]Great.
[155:31.83]Your first stunt was a success.
[155:34.21]This will improve movie quality and the stunt skill of your stuntman.
[155:37.75]God damn it.
[155:39.03]I didn't.
[155:46.91]You can usually predict the outcome of a stunt by its difficulty.
[155:50.23]Yeah, okay.
[155:51.05]However, with the cameras rolling and the adrenaline pumping, adding stunts to your movies isn't... Now, let's wait for shooting to finish.
[156:03.28]Quality.
[156:10.06]Thank you, Handshoes, for the 500 bits.
[156:11.12]Have you ever thought about making a Discord for subs?
[156:13.40]I'd chill out there all day.
[156:15.80]Yeah, I just don't know how it works.
[156:19.04]I don't use Discord, so I don't really know how it works.
[156:25.11]Did I miss a movie?
[156:26.13]Probably not.
[156:29.47]If you want to use the stuntmen, all you got to do is just wait for them to be done shooting.
[156:37.45]Then put your stuntmen inside of the studio.
[156:41.97]Okay.
[156:45.78]Oh, remember when I hit you with that log in the head?
[156:51.05]Let's drink to that.
[156:52.01]What's going on?
[157:00.85]Okay.
[157:02.46]Cut.
[157:02.72]That's a wrap.
[157:04.54]Now moving to the casting department.
[157:07.20]This guy's fucking drunk.
[157:12.45]If you want to watch this?
[157:20.40]Alright, let's watch this shitty movie they made.
[157:23.16]You guys ready?
[157:26.36]Here comes the shitty default movie.
[157:28.70]Where the guy gets hit in the face with a giant log.
[157:30.95]And here we...
[157:38.12]Go.
[157:38.38]This is two and a half stars.
[157:39.28]You're telling me this movie is two and a half fucking stars?
[157:41.80]And the one that I just made is not?
[157:44.89]Okay.
[158:09.61]who is that that's not it wasn't even the same person
[158:40.21]I'm disgusted that that got two stars.
[158:43.13]That got more than any of my movies.
[158:46.83]Unbelievable.
[158:51.13]You've given audiences a taste and they're banned.
[158:53.73]Unfortunately, there's no more scripts.
[158:56.09]Pick up a script writer and hover them over a script office.
[159:01.26]Oh, Buddhist script writer right here.
[159:02.92]Notice the stuntman icon in the corner of each genre room.
[159:06.98]Choose a genre and drop your script writer to save the stuntman from harm.
[159:11.50]Script writers will only create stunt scenes suited to the stunt skill of your hired performers.
[159:16.76]So it's vital to improve with a custom script writing office.
[159:20.64]You can select stunts of any difficulty you wish.
[159:23.72]Just don't be surprised if you end up with some horribly wounded stuntmen.
[159:27.92]While waiting for script writing to finish, you can improve.
[159:31.18]Build a training Spartan torture facility on your lot.
[159:35.31]Make a torture chamber?
[159:36.41]Is that what he just said?
[159:39.65]Fast forward.
[159:41.81]Thankfully, it'll be like the 70s by the time we're done with this.
[159:46.37]But, as I was saying... As I was saying...
[159:51.95]Hover your stuntman over the training facility, and an interact icon will appear.
[159:57.35]Drop your stuntman on this icon to make them train.
[160:00.33]Training is a great way for performers to gain stunt skill, but there's no gain without pain, so they'll also lose some condition.
[160:09.46]You're real good at this.
[160:14.90]That's superhuman.
[160:20.89]Spartan torture is designed for inexperienced stuntmen.
[160:25.25]Once they have it mastered, they'll need a more advanced... Although a stunt performer's condition... Build a hospital to mend your stunt performers when things go belly up.
[160:39.54]Where's the hospital going?
[160:40.50]Come on, right... That's fine.
[160:51.40]Get in there.
[160:54.52]Okie dokie.
[160:57.13]Hurry it up.
[160:58.01]What else do you want me to build?
[160:59.93]What do you want me to build here?
[161:00.69]I just did it.
[161:01.73]Fuck off.
[161:04.97]Spartan Torture.
[161:05.97]If I theoretically got a deal to do something on TV, would I do it?
[161:10.02]Oh, absolutely.
[161:19.70]If they're pulled out too early, great.
[161:22.28]You've completed the stunts tutorial.
[161:24.67]You should now be able to hire- Finally, you're ready to hear about the latest invitation we've received from the Lionhead- It seems they've dreamed up a set of stunts- Hover over this button to check your progress through your current rank of stunt achievements.
[161:40.00]Okay.
[161:40.30]Alright, can we do it now?
[161:44.32]Can I do this?
[161:47.86]Have I unlocked stunts?
[161:51.38]That looks like we did.
[161:54.38]Okay.
[161:55.04]I think we did.
[161:56.26]Stuntman feature unlocked.
[161:58.52]Alright.
[161:59.30]We're ready to go for it.
[162:00.48]But we're not ready to go for it.
[162:02.32]I was just fucking with you.
[162:03.66]Thought we were going.
[162:06.86]Sorry.
[162:07.30]Time for a tea break.
[162:13.72]See you guys in one minute.
[164:17.04]And we're back.
[164:18.80]Alright, let's do some stunts.
[164:23.58]Let's get some stunts here.
[164:24.86]Okay, this is going to be... What was this again?
[164:26.35]It's going to be... What was the name of the Wild West movie we were doing?
[164:36.20]Wait, what?
[164:38.28]What?
[164:50.40]I don't care that it's... Bella's big diamond.
[164:58.25]Spelled wrong.
[165:00.93]Who cares?
[165:01.45]Ninja costume?
[165:13.72]Spitoui Saloon.
[165:14.60]That's what it was.
[165:15.32]Okay.
[165:17.91]Bella's Big Damon.
[165:20.73]Bella's Big Damon.
[165:37.58]Okay.
[165:38.86]These guys are all going to do their own stunts, by the way.
[165:41.09]I don't care about their well-being at all.
[165:44.27]No, not Santa Claus.
[165:45.19]What the hell am I doing?
[165:48.89]No, it is going to be Santa Claus.
[165:52.13]Who gives a shit, right?
[166:00.04]You can just have like creepy mustaches.
[166:02.64]Whatever, there's Santa.
[166:13.04]He's got lipstick on, too, apparently, for some reason.
[166:15.28]Okay.
[166:17.58]What should she be dressed in?
[166:40.85]No apes.
[166:42.87]No apes.
[166:48.15]Straight up west and wild west.
[166:54.52]Freeform, Spittooey Saloon.
[166:55.78]They're going to do their own stunts because I don't, like I said, don't care about their well-being at all.
[167:00.39]Spittooey Saloon.
[167:02.75]Now let me see.
[167:10.29]Wild West Bank, Wild West Desert, Wild West Saloon.
[167:14.07]Okay.
[167:16.43]Stunts.
[167:18.33]Head impact.
[167:20.71]Explode.
[167:21.45]Okay, now we're getting into some real shit, guys.
[167:30.18]Now we're getting into the weeds here.
[167:31.98]Okay.
[167:42.43]Oh, goodness.
[167:51.41]The first scene is Santa strangling somebody.
[168:02.52]This is gonna be like a shitty extra.
[168:07.34]Well, I just wanna see what like is possible.
[168:10.58]Head impact.
[168:14.68]They can smash the head.
[168:16.85]Injured.
[168:18.25]Shock.
[168:21.73]I'm trying to get somebody hurt.
[168:28.65]No, it's got to be the actors come on in.
[168:32.03]Two shitty extras.
[168:37.24]Are on the path, right?
[168:43.21]Wait, what was... No, there's no stunts there.
[168:44.98]Okay.
[168:49.54]Rural field.
[168:50.38]No, it was the... Hold on.
[169:02.42]I gotta disable my notifications.
[169:09.89]Yeah.
[169:13.57]Alright.
[169:14.15]Sorry.
[169:14.61]My phone was just like blowing up there.
[169:15.93]Alright.
[169:17.41]What was it called?
[169:19.03]It was a wild saloon bedroom traveling vehicle.
[169:23.43]There are stunts here.
[169:24.39]Stagecoach fight.
[169:28.96]Traveling violence.
[169:30.00]Alright.
[169:31.02]No stunts.
[169:34.04]We're going to have them pull up.
[169:36.56]They pull up and when they get there, Santa's strangling somebody to death.
[169:44.63]Static one.
[169:46.86]It was just it moving, right?
[169:48.52]Speed canter.
[169:49.82]I want it to be camera two.
[169:56.40]There it is.
[169:59.70]I'm going to put a bunch of hay noises in there and shit.
[170:03.21]Static one again.
[170:04.07]This time I'm going to use my fucking skills.
[170:11.17]Get like right here.
[170:12.13]This is where it was before.
[170:17.55]Like that.
[170:19.93]You got to be moving though.
[170:21.19]Okay.
[170:33.89]They have the conversation inside.
[170:43.96]It's traveling conversation.
[170:50.20]No, not Santa.

[171:40.11]I refuse.
[171:41.71]This dress.
[171:45.28]Where's the E guy?
[171:46.08]He's right here.
[171:46.62]See, watch.
[171:48.66]I'm gonna do the voiceover.
[171:49.62]It's gonna be like, Eeeeee.
[171:52.88]And that's why we gotta steal that gold from Santa.
[171:55.40]He's inside of the saloon right now.
[171:57.62]Don't you understand?
[171:58.66]Yes, it's funny to me.

[209:47.85]Yes, you do get the purple suit.
[209:52.63]This is going a little bit faster than before.
[209:54.23]This is on scene three already.
[209:59.81]But, Pajagallo, thanks for the thousand bits.
[210:03.97]Yeah, like I said before, the gorilla is kind of just, has to be in every movie now, I guess.
[210:09.23]You're right.
[210:09.63]Thank you, Todd.
[210:11.69]Todd, he knows for 500 bits.
[210:14.97]Add a fart noise after the explosion.
[210:16.71]I can't, I promised no fart noises.
[210:20.06]Never promised no burps, though.
[210:22.22]So, we'll see where that goes.
[210:28.51]But somebody asked, Polar Autumn, you asked if I was going to do anything Christmassy.
[210:33.32]Um, probably not.
[210:35.10]Just because I don't really ever do anything holiday related.
[210:41.48]Oh wait, this is important.
[210:42.74]Hold on.
[210:44.66]If I were to do something, it would be something small.
[210:48.86]Alright, where are they right now?
[210:52.52]Right here.
[210:52.82]Alright, this has potential for disaster.
[210:56.66]So let's watch and see if they can even film this.
[211:02.55]Is this like an actor?
[211:03.24]Are you in this scene?
[211:07.20]Okay, here comes a stunt.
[211:11.02]Are they going to survive the first stunt?
[211:16.51]I wonder.
[211:18.49]He chokes this guy.
[211:19.35]Does this guy live?
[211:37.02]You alright?
[211:39.32]Wow.
[211:42.70]He's alright.
[211:44.26]Okay.
[211:45.83]He's not hurt.
[211:54.18]The one thing, though, when the explosions happen, it's not going to work.
[211:58.80]I can't foresee that actually happening.
[212:03.22]Ooh, a stunt.
[212:04.00]Wait, what's this?
[212:04.80]Who is this?
[212:05.24]What is this?
[212:05.76]Is this a new... I don't remember putting this in.
[212:27.59]What the f- Oh shit This guy like broke his neck Oh god Wait I think- Is this guy okay?
[212:53.46]Is he gonna be able to continue filming?
[213:09.47]He's okay.
[213:13.53]Which, where?
[213:16.11]Oh, right here?
[213:16.59]Okay.
[213:19.05]Looking forward to this one.
[213:19.83]He broke his leg.
[213:26.87]Yeah, they're not important.
[213:27.81]Who cares?
[213:34.07]Filming canceled.
[213:34.69]That'd be horrible.
[213:42.99]Wait, this isn't supposed to happen, right?
[213:45.87]That's not supposed to happen right now.
[213:47.31]They're all getting fucking really hurt.
[213:57.67]Wait, hold on.
[213:59.43]Why is that happening now?
[214:04.36]Isn't that supposed to happen later?
[214:09.68]Every single person is limping.
[214:16.95]There's like three more explosions.
[214:23.26]He's in bad shape.
[214:29.92]It's alright.
[214:30.26]You only got like 30 more scenes to film.
[214:33.35]Your attention please.
[214:34.67]A stunt is about to be filmed on set.
[214:45.43]Why don't they just film them all back to back?
[214:49.05]Why are they putting themselves through this much torment?
[214:57.12]What happened to the place being on fire?
[214:58.66]I don't care.
[215:03.22]Skip this, skip- I got more important shit to do.
[215:09.30]What happened to this place being on fire?
[215:15.97]Remember like I made his face, like zoomed in on his face?
[215:17.95]Oh, somebody else got hurt.
[215:32.88]Wait.
[215:34.64]They both got seriously injured.
[215:35.98]They have to go to the hospital.
[215:38.34]Fuck.
[215:49.14]No.
[215:51.66]No.
[215:52.65]I'm sorry.
[215:53.11]What's the next scene?
[215:53.81]What's the next scene?
[215:55.09]Wild West Traveling Vehicle.
[215:56.35]Why are they shooting this all out of order?
[216:15.12]We're done.
[216:15.80]There's nothing more to teach you, but you got plenty to think about, so get to it.
[216:20.85]Good luck.
[216:23.07]That was the end of the tutorial.
[216:26.45]Everybody's in agony, apparently.
[216:30.31]Is this guy's assistant?
[216:37.40]No, I want them to do the movie.
[216:45.09]I don't care how fucking hurt you are.
[216:48.72]Who else needs to be?
[216:49.66]Just him?
[216:51.04]Well, the girl too, right?
[216:58.28]Who are you?
[216:58.76]Why is this so out of order?
[217:03.65]I'm going to have to go in and change a couple things around when it's done.
[217:31.49]These coin sounds do not stop.
[217:44.80]I'm so sorry about the coin sounds.
[217:48.15]It's a new stunt.
[217:54.53]Who else is here?
[217:55.09]Who else needs to be here for this?
[217:59.95]Nobody?
[218:02.59]Where's the director?
[218:07.05]Shoot it!
[218:08.65]Come on, you only got like 20 more fucking scenes to shoot.
[218:11.15]That is really dangerous.
[218:19.00]I kind of feel bad now.
[218:32.23]I love how he broke a bone doing that.
[218:35.92]He broke an ankle or something.
[218:39.38]He can't even move.
[218:41.50]He's dumbfounded.
[218:44.30]Well, sorry to tell you, dude.
[218:45.36]You kind of have to sit there again.
[218:46.52]Now, what's that?
[218:50.45]You're going to get burnt again?
[219:01.02]Yep, yep, yep.
[219:02.00]Go for it.
[219:04.68]Alright.
[219:10.45]Here we go again.
[219:12.15]Get back in that fire, Santa.
[219:20.86]Oh, wow.
[219:25.32]He sprained his ankle.
[219:37.92]If you don't fix your money, it's gonna- I'm bleeding money?
[219:41.16]Well, what do I do?
[219:45.18]Just start firing people?
[219:50.63]How do I stop bleeding money?
[219:56.03]Alright, what's next?
[220:00.17]Hurry up.
[220:00.75]We gotta finish this movie quick.
[220:03.44]20 more scenes to shoot and we- Oh my god, we're losing money fast.
[220:09.71]Slow it down.
[220:10.27]We need money.
[220:12.75]Can I take out a loan from the bank?
[220:15.92]Balance income studio.
[220:19.30]How do I take out a loan?
[220:22.38]Oh, sorry, honeys.
[220:24.22]Sorry, my honeys.
[220:26.42]No, your salaries are dropping.
[220:33.12]Sorry, all you honeys.
[220:41.83]Okay.
[220:42.83]They're not terrible.
[220:47.26]Okay, we're still bleeding money.
[220:51.36]Everybody's pay is getting docked.
[220:52.72]That's fine.
[220:53.72]Go.
[220:57.28]We're almost halfway through this.
[220:59.80]Almost there.
[221:04.00]Trying a tantrum about his pay cut.
[221:07.50]Stop saying honeys.
[221:08.63]I said it like three times.
[221:10.31]Come on.
[221:15.21]Send them to the hospital before they die?
[221:18.27]What was this?
[221:26.87]We're not bleeding that much money anymore.
[221:28.27]We got... We're almost halfway there.
[221:34.56]Heal your actors?
[221:36.92]They're gonna be fine.
[221:44.02]Where's the hospital?
[221:47.20]Alright, get him to the hospital.
[221:49.46]It's a wrap.
[221:50.78]It's a wrap.
[221:52.20]Everybody can have a day in the hospital.
[221:54.14]One day in the hospital.
[222:02.89]You hear that?
[222:03.75]You get one day in the hospital.
[222:18.93]Hey, they did one right.
[222:20.11]Look at that.
[222:27.21]Okay, you're... Now you're healed.
[222:34.29]Look at you.
[222:34.81]You feel better.
[222:37.59]Waiting at the trailer.
[222:39.77]Get in the hospital, please.
[222:41.31]Heal her.
[222:42.89]And then Santa's going up next.
[222:54.01]Santa's pretty integral, though.
[222:58.79]He needs to be in, like, every scene.
[223:01.83]How many scenes left?
[223:03.79]Like, 17?
[223:04.73]Something like that? 16?
[223:16.40]Hey, you're back.
[223:17.06]Alright, what are you doing?
[223:18.96]Throwing a tantrum.
[223:20.46]Well, now you're in the hospital.
[223:25.37]What, are we shooting right now?
[223:28.89]Waiting for what?
[223:30.09]This guy.
[223:31.01]Everyone's recovering.
[223:31.87]Everyone's going to be fine.
[223:37.00]And then everyone can get back to work.
[223:41.86]Bankruptcy court.
[223:42.60]No, we're going to be alright.
[223:44.18]Don't worry.
[223:48.15]If we really need to, we can make a Stuntman.
[223:53.23]Just have him on call.
[223:55.81]Alright, Santa's fine.
[223:56.65]Alright, Santa.
[224:01.23]You're throwing a tantrum currently.
[224:02.55]That's just great.
[224:05.73]I believe he is needed over here.
[224:07.86]Maybe not.
[224:08.78]Alright, here we go.
[224:16.14]The scene...
[224:25.44]He just got out of the hospital.
[224:28.88]Stop.
[224:29.52]Fuck, I just hired that guy.
[224:30.82]Why did I hire him?
[224:31.56]Alright, we gotta stop cutting people.
[224:35.97]Janitors.

[226:29.66]Come on, hurry up.
[226:31.96]Get over here.
[226:32.66]You think I was just in the hospital?
[226:35.50]I took him out of the hospital bed.
[226:41.61]Now what scene is this?
[226:42.41]Do you see how, like, out of order they're filming these scenes?
[226:49.91]I'm very confused.
[226:50.97]Okay, we're doing good.
[227:00.99]The studio's going down over a shitty tier B list straight to Walmart bargain bin.
[227:10.13]What happens if I get to zero dollars?
[227:13.43]This movie has to be made.
[227:19.22]It's... Pause the game.
[227:31.39]Pause it.
[227:33.91]What happens if I get to zero?
[227:40.24]Expenditures.
[227:42.50]Staff stars custom script writing.
[227:46.82]Fuck.
[227:59.32]We kind of just have to let it ride out.
[228:05.22]Use a cheat code?
[228:14.23]We gotta go.
[228:15.39]You've gotta fucking go.
[228:16.87]Where's the director?
[228:18.09]Get the fuck in the director chair.
[228:19.27]Stop drinking.
[228:19.95]This is why we do sandbox mode.
[228:26.11]Because our grandiose ideas.
[228:27.53]I don't know how to cheat.
[228:35.72]We've got a good, like, 15 minutes before this is gone.
[228:46.39]And then we're fucking screwed.
[228:52.60]Hold on a second.
[228:54.92]I'm legitimately looking up if there are cheat codes for this game.
[229:07.35]Give me a second.
[229:16.09]Fuck, you gotta edit like a game file.
[229:22.88]They're not gonna kick me out, are they?
[229:30.72]Dude, if this guy would just stop fucking leaving.
[229:34.92]Who are we missing?

[229:53.14]I have three of them in the... We don't have time for this.
[230:15.20]Don't have time.
[230:15.84]Go.
[230:16.00]17 out of 31.
[230:24.92]How many explosions in a row are they going to do?
[230:27.35]Fuck.
[230:33.69]We're getting even closer.
[230:35.13]We're getting up to less than 10 in a minute here.
[230:40.93]I'm going to save the game and we can break it later.
[230:47.24]Save it, save it, save it.
[230:48.00]Go, quickly.
[230:48.24]We'll get there, don't worry.
[230:49.10]Yeah, these scenes are really easy.
[230:52.29]Santa's crying.
[231:18.14]Hurry up!
[231:23.08]Is that the Easter Bunny?
[231:27.26]Dude, this movie... It's like people fucking seriously hurting themselves.
[231:32.59]Okay, now we gotta fire more stuff.
[231:47.83]This is, um... I can't fire the extras.

[232:43.58]What is this?
[232:45.36]Oh, fuck.
[232:46.18]This guy's threatening... Who's that guy?
[232:47.80]This guy's threatening to quit.
[232:50.67]Hold on.
[232:53.57]Give me some more money.
[232:57.48]Hold on, hold on, hold on.

[237:15.02]No fucking awards for me, apparently.
[237:23.87]Couple more.
[237:28.15]I think we're gonna get it.
[237:28.81]Everybody's crying.
[237:31.03]Every people are crying, people are screaming.
[237:55.47]Go!

[238:05.90]We have $200,000 left and we need to film like six more scenes after this.
[238:10.92]They already have trailers.
[238:12.48]That was a fucking other explosion.
[238:17.02]Go!
[238:19.70]What's next?
[238:22.18]May I have your attention, please?
[238:26.07]Here we go.
[238:29.93]We just need the director too.
[238:31.27]That's it.
[238:31.51]These guys can do whatever the fuck they want.
[238:35.07]I don't care.
[238:38.25]1970, June, May, Mar- J-Jerry, March, May, June.
[238:42.46]Hold on.
[238:42.78]Hold on.
[238:43.00]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[238:43.62]Slow down.
[238:43.92]Bring him to the fucking hospital.
[238:49.26]Because we're filming this right now.
[238:53.50]Go to the bar.
[238:57.02]Shit.
[239:00.20]Fuck.
[239:02.72]How did she get hurt?
[239:03.54]This place is on fire.
[239:09.12]Why is this place on fire?
[239:11.83]What's next?
[239:17.39]So close.
[239:18.79]We got plenty of money.
[239:19.57]Get back to finances.
[239:21.37]Come here.
[239:26.28]This guy's about to quit.
[239:27.38]I don't even have any money.
[239:28.10]I can't.
[239:28.34]We're gonna have to recast this guy.
[239:29.34]Who's here?
[239:29.68]This guy quits.
[239:30.14]Do we have to recast him?
[239:31.60]Is it a different actor?
[239:57.22]He's gonna quit, but the movie's almost done.
[240:00.32]We're so close!
[240:01.72]Only five more scenes!
[240:06.02]Go!
[240:06.26]Hurry!
[240:06.46]Not much now.
[240:10.64]Go!
[240:27.30]Before he quits, get all the scenes filmed before he quits.
[240:39.17]I got money.
[240:42.67]He's hurt again.
[240:47.98]I gotta bring this guy to fucking finances.
[240:50.74]No, I can't.
[240:53.72]What, if you have less than $200,000, you can't?
[240:58.29]I don't think I can.
[240:59.25]We're going to have to recast him.
[241:02.21]Where's he?
[241:10.56]Go.
[241:13.98]Four more scenes.
[241:15.22]This guy's going to quit.
[241:17.10]After this explosion, he's going to be dead.
[241:23.06]After that explosion.
[241:24.00]That took number four.
[241:27.42]Oh no.
[241:30.70]I think that fucking crew got hurt too.
[241:35.46]He quit.
[241:37.10]Okay.
[241:38.48]He needs to be recast.
[241:40.77]Easy.
[241:42.75]Weighs a random fucking bum on the street.
[241:44.87]I don't even care.
[241:45.99]Who are you?
[241:47.53]Who is this guy?
[241:49.65]You wanna work in Hollywood?
[241:51.95]Who wants to work in Hollywood?
[241:58.05]You?
[242:00.51]Come here.
[242:07.26]What?
[242:07.70]What?
[242:13.42]What?
[242:17.32]I need to film like two scenes.
[242:21.72]Who are you?
[242:26.35]I can't hire anybody.
[242:30.93]Why is everything red?
[242:33.95]Why is everything red?
[242:36.27]Every building is broken.
[242:37.27]Okay, we need, uh... Slow it down.
[242:44.25]Slow this shit down.
[242:45.61]Hold on.

[242:59.79]There's not much time.
[243:00.55]Everything is red.
[243:08.68]We need to shoot three scenes.
[243:10.86]We need to shoot three scenes.
[243:13.26]You are going to be huge.
[243:15.84]Emma.
[243:16.38]Emma, you're going to be huge one day.
[243:18.10]Trust me.
[243:28.95]you've been recast where is it attention everyone a star has just quit oh off they all have to get recast it's all broken I'll wait for them to repair and then we can finish this movie with three completely different actors may I have your attention there's a building
[243:56.61]I can't do anything until they're all repaired.
[243:58.53]I'm going to lose all my money.
[244:00.21]It's all done.
[244:02.09]It's over.
[244:04.75]Okay, there's that one.
[244:09.72]Rehab.
[244:10.38]No, we need two people, right?
[244:16.06]Create actor.
[244:16.68]Create director.
[244:17.28]Where do I go to do this?
[244:19.14]Director.
[244:19.74]Okay.
[244:20.06]Lead roles.
[244:26.35]Oh, do I have to pull this over here now?
[244:27.77]What?
[244:28.33]What?
[245:01.03]I wonder if, like, this works.
[245:05.39]Okay.
[245:05.91]Rehearsing the script.
[245:07.25]Okay.
[245:21.62]Do we already have this shit shut?
[245:23.74]Or no?
[245:36.71]I'm curious.
[245:37.43]Because I have it saved.
[245:38.35]I have like two save files.
[245:48.62]Nope.
[245:53.45]I do not want to save my current game.
[245:55.45]Alright, it was fuck and then fuck this, right?
[245:57.49]I need to cheat.
[246:05.05]We're not in sandbox mode.
[246:06.45]I didn't have enough money to make this like 30 fucking scene production.
[246:11.64]I'm going to edit that fucking config file.
[246:14.14]Because I have this still.
[246:16.08]This was during shooting, right?
[246:17.62]2305 2251
[246:24.30]It was this one.
[246:26.41]I have it saved.
[246:27.17]We're cheating.
[246:28.65]Because I was playing as if I was playing.
[246:34.63]It's the fight on the carriage?
[246:35.71]Are you sure?
[246:36.14]Are you sure about that?
[246:39.10]It didn't look like it.
[246:41.64]Just for curiosity's sake, I will humor you.
[246:48.91]I can't even use it yet.
[246:54.23]No, this is scene 1 of 31.
[246:55.39]I'm cheating.
[247:00.66]Let me just make sure this is in the right spot.
[247:07.38]So this is 2251.
[247:09.14]I believe they're in the middle of shooting.
[247:13.48]Gotta finish this fucking movie.
[247:15.90]Yes, they're in the middle of shooting this.
[247:17.96]18 out of 31.
[247:18.54]I actually think I might be able to salvage this.
[247:24.15]If I make sure these people don't quit.
[247:26.42]And I don't fire every... Here's what happened.
[247:29.06]I fired every single fucking builder, and I didn't realize that they can't repair anything.
[247:33.64]So here's what's gonna happen.
[247:35.04]I had $100,000.
[247:36.02]I have enough money.
[247:39.39]We're gonna make sure these people are all happy.
[247:43.27]Repair them.
[247:44.51]Make them happy.
[247:46.13]Don't fire every builder.
[247:47.58]Fire the janitors for all you fucking... I don't care.
[247:51.76]This is going to get done.
[247:54.66]Let's go through and make sure we fire the... These are all crew members.
[247:59.88]Don't fire them.
[248:02.80]It's a janitor.
[248:03.62]The researchers can go.
[248:05.70]Get these researchers out of here.
[248:14.92]In the meantime... Make sure these people all stay happy.
[248:18.44]And it can be done.
[248:20.90]I'll be fine.
[248:23.36]I just don't want to fire the builders.
[248:25.04]Repair the actors.
[248:27.48]Make sure I still have... Okay, I still have two builders.
[248:30.90]We're not going to bleed.
[248:32.14]We're going to be bleeding the fuck out of our bank account.
[248:34.82]But not nearly enough where it's going to be an issue.
[248:38.02]I'm not going to fire any more people.
[248:41.46]I'm just going to let people do whatever the fuck they want.
[248:44.58]Overeating.
[248:45.92]Like getting drunk.
[248:46.74]Like go do it.
[248:47.48]Do whatever you want.
[248:49.58]Go have at it for like a day.
[248:52.47]And then come back strong.
[248:58.64]Where are you?
[249:01.30]All janitors are fired, yeah.
[249:04.88]Where's the hospital?
[249:05.80]Okay, let's... Recovery in progress.
[249:12.65]This movie's getting finished.
[249:26.51]I don't care what it takes.
[249:29.55]Uh, really?
[249:32.45]Because I fired my researchers.
[249:33.67]Bullshit.
[249:36.47]Alright, don't put this guy right back to work.
[249:39.69]You're in bad condition.
[249:40.69]Go to the hospital.
[249:42.35]Where's Santa?
[249:45.67]Where is Santa?
[249:52.62]Okay, this guy...
[249:55.47]He's currently going to the set.
[249:56.71]Where is he?
[250:00.20]He didn't get hurt.
[250:00.88]Thank God.
[250:02.08]Bring this guy to the bar.
[250:05.38]He wants to quit.
[250:09.92]We lucked out there.
[250:11.09]Kind of lucked out.
[250:12.13]Bring him to the bar.
[250:13.09]Enjoy yourself.
[250:25.34]Shut up.
[250:26.08]I got hurt.
[250:27.40]It's a wrap.
[250:28.22]Thank you.
[250:28.82]We're going to be fine.
[250:33.00]This movie is not even worth it either.
[250:34.46]This movie sucks.
[250:36.40]It's not even a good movie.
[250:37.76]A stunt has gone wrong, injuring the performers.
[250:42.01]We just had an auto-save right there.
[250:43.31]He's still going to quit.
[250:49.83]He's happy.
[250:51.25]Go to finances.
[250:52.05]Come here.
[250:52.37]Newsflash.
[250:55.11]Let's give this guy a raise.
[251:00.16]I have to give them at least a couple of them raises, I think.
[251:02.48]I'm going to quit.
[251:03.16]He's not going to quit anymore.
[251:04.48]20 out of 31.
[251:04.76]Don't even worry about the money.
[251:06.72]Where is everybody else?
[251:18.99]Okay.
[251:20.71]Currently waiting at the trailer.
[251:22.11]On set.
[251:24.95]Alright.
[251:25.79]They're going again.
[251:26.35]And action.
[251:35.03]Snap.
[251:36.43]That's a wrap.
[251:36.93]Thank you.
[251:39.03]It's a wrap.
[251:40.97]Thank you.
[251:45.08]That's 21.
[251:48.29]Save it.
[251:49.79]Save it under, fuck this.
[251:59.38]People are at least happy.
[252:04.56]Is the money gonna last?
[252:08.12]That's the real question.
[252:11.73]Look, we can go into extreme overdrive mode.
[252:15.17]Once this gets down to $100,000 is when I start dropping everybody's income.
[252:19.84]And then by the time they want to quit, too late.
[252:21.76]You're already here.
[252:23.66]Not going to happen, you know?
[252:25.78]Yeah.
[252:28.98]It's a wrap.
[252:29.80]Thank you.
[252:32.56]There's still two more explosions.
[252:36.97]What's wrong with her?
[252:37.71]Throwing a tantrum.
[252:40.23]Today's the big awards day.
[252:42.89]The studio head's presence is required
[252:46.75]Yeah, I'm not gonna win a damn award.
[252:50.29]Not even one nomination.
[252:54.77]Get back to work.
[252:59.55]I'm actually getting some pretty good RNG right now, considering that no one has broken a bone in like three shots.
[253:05.35]We're getting closer.
[253:06.03]Yeah, throw a tantrum.
[253:17.95]Jerma accidentally made a challenge run.
[253:21.80]Another stunt successful.
[253:23.20]Blowing right by.
[253:24.92]We've still got plenty of money.
[253:28.77]Just let him get it done.
[253:33.83]This game seems like a fun game.
[253:35.01]It is.
[253:36.63]For all the bullshit and bullfuckery that I'm doing right now, it's actually a very fun game.
[253:42.08]Highly recommend it.
[253:43.90]Although you can't get it on Steam.
[253:46.30]You have to buy this from Amazon or eBay.
[253:48.92]You have to get a boxed copy of it.
[253:52.10]Because apparently there was some licensing issue with Activision.
[253:55.74]Oh fuck, there was the explosion.
[253:58.41]It's okay.
[254:00.01]Is he hurt?
[254:00.65]How hurt is he?
[254:03.15]Let's save it right now.
[254:09.44]Oh boy, he's really hurt.
[254:15.73]Alright, go to the hospital.
[254:16.79]I'm fine.
[254:23.19]24 to 31.
[254:23.71]We haven't freaked out yet.
[254:34.23]This is the... This is the girl's stunt here.
[254:38.41]Where she falls out of a window.
[254:42.65]Did I have any issues getting it to run?
[254:44.35]No.
[254:45.99]The only issue I had was I had to run it in the window to stream it.
[254:50.09]Because it doesn't count as a game capture.
[254:52.32]So I'm just capping my window.
[254:53.82]My monitor kind of right now.
[254:58.66]After her... Okay, after she... She got hurt again.
[255:05.25]She is going... He's going to the bar, and then she's going right into the hospital after he's out.
[255:11.86]Why do they make them do their own stunts?
[255:15.66]Every single shot is somebody getting hurt.
[255:17.26]Oh, my God.
[255:22.32]Is she going to the hospital?
[255:24.44]Well, you are now.
[255:28.76]Your attention, please.
[255:30.10]A stunt is about to be filmed on set.
[255:33.86]Getting there.
[255:35.28]25 out of 31.
[255:35.70]Okay, last time we were at 25 out of 31, I was in total disarray.
[255:43.71]This was a nightmare back then.
[255:46.75]And I'm still over 100,000.
[255:47.69]We're gonna get there.
[255:51.66]I wish they would make movies too.
[255:54.06]It'd be amazing.
[255:55.62]There's so much potential for this genre.
[256:00.89]Alright, everyone's okay.
[256:02.19]Back on the set.
[256:02.93]Everyone seems to be happy again.
[256:04.53]I think this is where we start dragging people over here.
[256:07.95]It is.
[256:11.36]Go.
[256:16.62]Once we're in this last stretch here with four or five scenes left to shoot, it's time to drag these fucking people around.
[256:23.74]It's okay.
[256:27.39]You can go fuck yourself.
[256:28.31]You're staying here on set.
[256:29.29]You're not going to go anywhere.
[256:30.03]You're staying here.
[256:34.28]This is where we speed run this right now.
[256:36.60]And we just ball through the wall.
[256:41.39]Because if you want to quit, it's going to take a little bit too much time.
[256:45.87]And the movie will be done.
[256:47.77]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[256:50.63]This movie is not even fucking good.
[256:52.57]This movie sucks.
[256:54.41]This movie sucks.
[256:56.88]Something's gone wrong.
[256:59.12]That's why she beats the fuck out of his face.
[257:01.84]Cut.
[257:02.34]Alright.
[257:02.70]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[257:05.86]Go ahead.
[257:06.68]Threaten me.
[257:12.66]Go.
[257:19.08]Hurry up.
[257:20.91]Who else?
[257:21.31]This guy right here.
[257:21.99]Hurry up.
[257:22.71]Go, go, go.
[257:25.25]27 out of 31.
[257:26.41]We're gonna get there.
[257:27.73]We're gonna do it.
[257:29.89]And then we can watch the movie.
[257:31.13]Oh, no.
[257:31.31]We have to do post-production.
[257:32.33]Oh, shit.
[257:34.03]Doesn't
[257:38.76]Fuck, why is there that many explosions?
[257:43.87]Nobody's threatening to quit and nobody's dead.
[257:46.03]That's it for her.
[257:48.39]That's it for him.
[257:49.31]Go.
[257:49.45]28 out of 31.
[257:49.77]$113,000.
[257:49.81]Why is he on a horse?
[258:08.82]Oh, right.
[258:11.04]It's a wrap.
[258:16.42]Thank you.
[258:18.00]Oh, my fucking stomach hurts.
[258:21.28]I've just been so giggly the whole time we've played this shit.
[258:24.06]Alright, where's the next scene?
[258:25.92]Last couple scenes.
[258:26.60]Here they are.
[258:33.19]Hurry up.
[258:34.51]Come on, bring the cameras.
[258:36.41]Get those cameras over here.
[258:39.79]Somebody just wrote, I've been masturbating this whole time.
[258:42.10]Well, that's fucked up.
[258:45.82]Go!
[258:53.77]What's the other?
[258:54.49]Oh shit, the monkey, the gorilla, the monkey scenes.
[258:58.27]Do we have the gorilla actress?
[258:59.69]Go!
[259:00.01]Hurry!
[259:09.01]Already there waiting.
[259:09.83]Look at that professional actor.
[259:12.43]You guys want to talk about a fucking professional actor?
[259:14.74]Was on set, ready to go for the gorilla scene.
[259:19.82]That's what we call a pro.
[259:20.84]No temper tantrums, no bullshit.
[259:25.54]One more scene after this, it's the car crash.
[259:30.50]You guys could have guessed that the number one employee was the gorilla.
[259:38.88]And that's it.
[259:40.16]One more scene.
[259:41.71]Go.
[259:42.77]Come on.
[259:45.39]$72,000.
[259:47.61]Stop fucking clapping and finish the movie.
[259:57.18]Go, hurry up.
[259:58.34]Get over here.
[260:02.94]Where's the gorilla?
[260:03.84]Doesn't the gorilla come here?
[260:07.16]What is this?
[260:10.39]I can't let go of you.
[260:13.09]Okay.
[260:13.77]Who are you waiting for?
[260:14.67]We got it.
[260:17.13]We got it.
[260:17.89]Go!
[260:18.07]Okay, I have $55,000 for post-production.
[260:18.89]Can I even do it?
[260:19.49]It's a wrap.
[260:19.89]We get 50 grand in the bank.
[260:38.81]This is where we fire every single person in the studio.
[260:41.85]Done deal.
[260:45.09]Okay, now I'm gonna sell everything.
[260:53.56]Post-production.
[260:57.18]Where is it?
[260:58.14]Where's the post-production fucking... Where is it?
[260:59.70]Do I even have the... Do I have this fucking thing?
[261:07.53]I don't think I even have a post-production office.
[261:10.50]Oh, fuck.
[261:15.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[261:17.08]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[261:20.72]Where is it?
[261:22.18]Post-production.
[261:39.60]Oh, shit!
[262:19.68]What the fuck?
[262:22.98]It's alright.
[262:23.66]Here we go.
[262:28.94]That's not what I wanted.
[262:29.66]What?
[262:30.79]What the fuck is going on here?
[262:31.57]2314.
[262:33.91]It was this one.
[262:34.97]Yeah, okay.
[262:35.49]It was fuck this.
[262:35.93]It was 2322.
[262:40.53]Okay, yeah.
[262:41.01]It was this one.
[262:54.00]Yeah, we just gotta wait for them to film a couple more scenes while I build a fucking post-production studio.
[263:01.94]You dickburger game.
[263:03.56]Give me a break.
[263:16.90]What if it corrupts my fucking saves?
[263:20.62]That's what I'm scared of.
[263:24.03]Well, that's a risk we're gonna take.
[263:28.31]How do I fucking cheat?
[263:30.72]Because the stupid-ass sandbox mode in this game doesn't allow you to start in the 60s.
[263:38.32]Which is horse dick.
[263:45.55]Why didn't I play sandbox?
[263:46.63]Because I couldn't.
[263:48.79]Because if I played Sandbox, I had to play from like 10 fucking years prior because they didn't update the game to Sandbox mode for the expansion.
[264:00.35]So we're going to add money.
[264:06.37]Tone it back, Jerma.
[264:07.29]Tone it back.
[264:07.97]I'm toning it back.
[264:15.47]Let's edit some INI files so we can watch our movie for crying out loud.
[264:23.48]Okay.
[264:24.22]I got the cheats right here.
[264:25.70]I have like 200 ads on this page, though.
[264:31.80]Hold on.
[264:38.38]Okay.
[264:38.72]Unlocking.ini file.
[264:41.57]Gain experience.
[264:42.55]Better ground.
[264:43.73]Less stress.
[264:47.85]I need the money.
[264:48.65]I just don't understand.
[264:58.10]I mean, the game's like 10 years old and it's a great game, but... If you have an expansion, why not make the sandbox mode where the expansion starts if you want to?
[265:07.08]What is up with that?
[265:08.26]I don't get it.
[265:11.84]Okay.
[265:12.20]Okay.
[265:23.40]I need the money cheating coward.
[265:25.60]I just wanted to play in sandbox mode, but we had to do like the quick start.
[265:39.61]Can go to the year 2000 in the INI file.
[265:43.23]Well, okay, we will remember that for next time.
[265:49.67]And app data.
[265:56.63]I can't believe it, like, didn't give me that shit.
[266:06.08]Alright, let me see here.
[266:10.82]Oh, that's the wrong thing.
[266:11.80]Hold on.
[266:20.30]I mean, but I want to watch that movie.
[266:22.41]That movie that we spent that much time working on.
[266:26.45]It's not, like, retroactive, so... Let me just see something.
[266:34.46]I'm curious.
[266:35.84]If I go to sandbox now... No.
[266:39.44]That's so fucking stupid!
[266:42.95]Why call it sandbox mode if you can't go past 1950?
[266:46.27]You have to edit a fucking INI file.
[266:50.49]That's dog shit.
[266:55.05]Alright, well, here's the deal.
[267:03.27]Okay.
[267:06.81]We're watching this movie.
[267:08.59]I don't care what it takes.
[267:09.34]We're doing whatever it takes to watch it.
[267:10.70]I wonder if any of these will work.
[267:20.22]Let's see.
[267:23.81]I actually think it might be okay if we go back.
[267:31.39]Yeah, I have to quit out and edit a couple things here.
[267:36.33]Grass, niceness, better ground.
[267:42.64]I don't see an actual add money thing, though.
[267:49.30]It's a lot of stress reduction stuff.
[267:53.87]think we're gonna be okay as long as I do yeah config changes won't reflect but if I do a config change it's there's no like money config change the five stages of grief I just want to watch my movie reload save straight to release movie watch with post without post production better than nothing yeah but post production makes the movie like the movie
[268:29.24]I'm going to try this one last thing.
[268:30.66]Because I'm just going to go from where we were, but there was only like five more scenes to shoot.
[268:36.76]Then see if we can get it done.
[268:40.71]Which was 2314.
[268:41.57]Which one is it?
[268:43.67]This one, right?
[268:50.91]Because if that's the case, I know Cheat Engine would be perfect.
[268:56.14]If I just build the post-production office and then fire everybody, I had enough money where I think it's gonna be okay.
[269:03.49]So, we're just gonna give it a minute here.
[269:06.47]And I think, actually, I can fucking screw everybody over right now at this point.
[269:11.93]Let's build the office.
[269:16.17]I thought it was already here.
[269:17.91]Because, remember when we did the quick start?
[269:19.91]It was like, oh, get right into it if you know how to play.
[269:22.53]I was assuming that they had already one of these built.
[269:26.60]Let's just see, out of curiosity's sake, if we can get it done.
[269:33.91]No, he's, like, practicing shit now.
[269:35.39]Alright, where we going?
[269:36.93]Over here.
[269:39.13]Let's just, we're gonna force people to work now.
[269:42.99]Everybody's already there.
[269:44.13]We're gonna save it every, like, fucking, every, after every scene, we're gonna save it.
[269:51.65]And hopefully we're bleeding money at a slow enough rate where, ah, she broke her neck.
[269:54.93]Okay.
[270:02.85]Thank you, Patrick Gallo, by the way, for the thousand.
[270:08.18]Stunt has gone wrong.
[270:09.26]It doesn't matter.
[270:09.92]These people, they can't quit fast enough and they won't die.
[270:13.94]So just get everybody, as many people over here as we can.
[270:18.66]Save it.
[270:23.44]This is the one.
[270:26.40]This is the one.
[270:29.21]I'm going to be so happy when this movie releases.
[270:30.93]We're so close to it being a thing.
[270:34.95]I don't care about the rival studio.
[270:38.97]Make sure this is actually built.
[270:40.71]Post-production.
[270:41.29]It's here.
[270:47.41]Okay.
[270:47.59]25 to 31.
[270:48.05]We're getting there.
[270:48.83]Close.
[270:49.21]We're forcing everybody to work.
[270:53.10]Next scene.
[270:59.33]Because like I said before, even if they want to quit, they're not going to be able to do it fast enough before the movie is done.
[271:05.41]This movie sucks, I know.
[271:13.77]We'll get it.
[271:17.51]We're going to be down to like $10,000, but we're going to get it.
[271:24.21]Now we can start firing people.
[271:29.76]and fire one of these builders.
[271:30.90]Drop the salaries.
[271:38.36]Drop everybody's salaries by, like, a huge amount.
[271:43.84]Where is it?
[271:45.26]Finances.
[271:46.82]Yeah, like, fuck you all.
[271:50.17]Go ahead and threaten to quit.
[271:51.59]The movie will be done.
[272:02.15]Getting close.
[272:04.93]Go, go, go, go.
[272:08.77]Get over there.
[272:10.45]Get it started.
[272:14.84]Save it.
[272:22.58]There's only a few more scenes.
[272:24.07]We're gonna get down to like $5,000.
[272:31.13]At least we'll be able to release it and watch it.
[272:37.72]And go again.
[272:38.62]That was good.
[272:39.32]That was good.
[272:40.34]That was a good quick run.
[272:42.08]We're almost there.
[272:42.90]Drag him.
[273:00.91]He's hurt.
[273:01.97]Now we move on to this, and then we just have the monkey.
[273:04.37]It doesn't matter if these people leave.
[273:11.24]Final train scene.
[273:21.54]Go!
[273:22.22]Get the crew here quick!
[273:23.97]Two more scenes!
[273:25.35]We're almost there.
[273:26.05]Save it!
[273:39.25]I hope it's not a post-production office.
[273:42.87]No, it's not.
[273:43.59]It's still... Okay, we're good.
[273:48.66]These actors don't matter anymore.
[273:49.72]Move on to the next scene.
[273:52.54]$70,000.
[273:52.56]We're good.
[273:58.60]You guys, thank you for your support.
[274:02.17]Miss Santa Claus, quit if you fucking feel like it.
[274:05.69]I don't care.
[274:06.13]Film it.
[274:12.89]One more scene.
[274:13.97]Post-production and we're good.
[274:19.35]I wish I wasn't stupid and put these closer together.
[274:26.82]We're gonna have about $50,000 or $60,000.
[274:28.72]We'll be fine.
[274:31.38]Game crash.
[274:31.88]I would shit my pants.
[274:32.60]Don't fire them.
[274:32.98]One of them is a gorilla.
[274:33.54]And the final shot.
[274:34.14]This is it.
[274:34.56]Let's save it.
[274:35.50]Just in case.
[274:35.98]You know what I'm saying.
[274:37.84]Jeez.
[275:00.91]Alright, get over here.
[275:02.33]Who are the other actors?
[275:04.36]It's like different people.
[275:06.48]Then we drag this immediately to post-production and then we can watch it.
[275:15.90]Yes!
[275:17.12]It actually worked.
[275:17.78]What a fucking disaster.
[275:18.62]What a nightmare.
[275:19.28]Still got some money.
[275:31.45]Done.
[275:32.65]Bring this stupid thing over to post-production as soon as I possibly can.
[275:40.02]There it is.
[275:44.24]Yes!
[275:44.58]Okay, good.
[275:51.09]We did it.
[275:52.73]We got there.
[275:55.83]Alright, Spitoui Saloon.
[276:01.10]Sorry about that, by the way.
[276:05.26]Wasn't prepared for this.
[276:06.46]Alright, we gotta have some good music.
[276:07.54]It's gonna be good.
[276:08.14]Let's see what this music is.
[276:10.16]That's fucking awful.
[276:15.63]This music is not gonna be here at all.
[276:18.93]I don't want, like, porn music on my Wild West movie.
[276:24.83]We need... Lone Fight.
[276:28.97]Let's see how this one sounds.
[276:35.63]No, I don't like that one either.
[276:36.43]I will record the dialog, don't worry.
[276:41.75]Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[277:14.35]Are we going to get some horse nays?
[277:35.68]Get away from me!
[277:36.66]Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
[277:39.14]That's from the other one.
[277:41.14]Well, let's go.
[277:41.62]I want to get that dialog first.
[277:52.28]Let's see how that sounds.
[278:28.16]Okay, hold on, we need her talking now.
[278:45.61]The music is fucking me up.
[278:56.16]Oh, fuck.
[278:56.89]No, it's still there.
[278:58.85]Shit, how do I get rid of it?
[279:00.29]I can't, like... There we go.
[279:07.06]I mean, I'm lowing it as low as I can get it.
[279:13.77]Fucking terrible I Got what the fuck do I say here?
[279:18.31]It's too quick.
[279:18.89]I need like a moment to prepare for that hold on I
[279:44.03]So what do you think of the scenery?
[279:45.59]I think it's the best in the world here in Westwood, California.
[279:50.56]Yeah, I know.
[279:51.72]Me too.
[279:52.72]So are you ready to fight the bad guy or what?
[279:55.44]He's bad.
[279:56.62]You gotta look at me straight, son.
[280:00.74]We need to take him out.
[280:02.30]He's a bad man.
[280:08.51]Horses are too loud.
[280:16.53]This whole thing's going in the trash can by the way.
[280:45.54]I'm changing it to this.
[281:13.62]Let's get her back here.
[281:15.48]So much work for this dumb fucking thing.
[281:24.02]You don't know the secret.
[281:26.23]I don't fucking even know.
[281:27.37]What am I even doing?
[281:28.17]The secret?
[281:30.85]What the fuck about the secret?
[281:36.23]You don't know the secret.
[281:37.83]I don't fucking even know.
[281:39.59]What am I even doing?
[281:47.38]I fucking didn't even know, what am I even doing?
[281:50.03]My mouth isn't moving.
[281:53.17]Your mouth is not moving.
[281:54.37]Hold on.
[282:06.80]This is all wrong now.
[282:17.38]I don't know.
[282:17.80]I have no idea.
[282:18.48]It's like too late for me to be doing this right now.
[282:47.04]You don't know the secret.
[282:48.18]I don't fucking even know.
[282:50.40]What am I even doing?
[282:51.74]What are we doing?
[282:52.74]I can't believe he's such a bad guy.
[282:54.62]We need to stop him.
[282:55.62]Don't you understand this?
[282:57.81]It's not funny.
[282:58.99]He has the strongest army in all of Central... I don't know.
[283:14.79]Central sus.
[283:17.15]It's just staying.
[283:17.87]I don't even care.
[283:18.61]We're not staying here all day.
[283:20.87]We're moving on.
[283:27.97]Get away from me!
[283:28.93]Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
[283:30.69]I'll take everybody on!
[283:32.37]It's the same dialog from the other one.
[283:38.34]Get away from me!
[283:39.30]Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
[283:41.08]I'll take everybody on!
[283:42.46]I'll kill you all!
[283:43.80]That's it, you're all gonna die!
[283:45.26]Alright, that's fine.
[283:46.88]That works.
[283:47.70]The same clip works.
[283:48.62]Yeah.
[283:55.88]The same clip.
[284:02.29]No, I don't like it.
[284:03.31]I don't like it.
[284:03.93]I don't like it there.
[284:05.33]No rehashing.
[284:06.81]No rehashing.
[284:10.62]I'm just going to add some screams.
[284:18.79]Animal sounds.
[284:23.19]How is that an animal sound?
[284:28.99]Also, keep in mind, remember, every single take, somebody got seriously injured.
[284:59.69]Stop it!
[285:09.63]That's it, acting.
[285:18.83]What ha- Why does they-
[285:23.95]No, this has to change.
[285:26.25]This is all fucked up.
[285:27.40]I knew it was fucked up.
[285:30.90]They get out of the trolley here.
[285:32.64]This has to move.
[285:34.60]Quit fucking with my game, man.
[285:36.10]Alright, so hold on.
[285:42.75]He kills that guy, throws him out.
[285:45.49]They get out of the van.
[285:53.07]And then he goes in.
[285:53.93]Oh my god, this is all so wrong.
[286:02.15]Right here.
[286:06.40]So he lights the place on fire.
[286:11.78]This wasn't this messed the hell up when I did it before, was it?
[286:15.36]I don't remember it being like this.
[286:25.04]Yeah, because then it cuts back.
[286:26.06]He's on fire.
[286:27.12]Yep.
[286:27.66]Alright.
[286:28.74]I think.
[286:30.94]Alright.
[286:31.30]Then he gets in.
[286:31.94]When does he go in?
[286:35.65]Okay.
[286:51.25]I need some noise here.
[287:00.61]No, that's not going in don't worry
[287:31.69]Can't believe we waited fucking like two hours for this shit.
[287:35.02]Yeah, because then it blows back.
[287:52.93]And I'm not sure what the hell that was.
[287:56.19]Because then he takes him outside.
[288:03.49]Alright, we need new music.
[288:16.04]No, that's too short.
[288:19.30]Too short.
[288:24.99]Dr. Moore's Evil Lab.
[288:34.73]No, too slow.
[288:37.15]Just remove the music.
[288:38.33]No, you need the music.
[288:40.20]It's important.
[288:41.82]Here we go.
[288:42.18]Yeehaw.
[288:42.56]I'm sure this will be at least makes sense, right?
[288:48.60]Alright, that's good.
[289:03.38]Or is it?
[289:04.24]Is it good enough?
[289:05.40]No.
[289:10.45]Eerie House Foolabout Mono.
[289:20.82]Alright, that's better.
[289:33.84]Okay, that explosion is not... Where's this from?
[289:39.25]What is the knife fight for?
[289:46.03]He carries him out.
[289:47.11]They have a knife fight?
[289:53.42]Why?
[289:53.70]I can't figure out why that's there.
[290:03.78]Okay, well.
[290:10.56]Okay, we need some sound effects here.
[290:16.85]We need man coughing, right?
[290:30.41]Man coughing.
[290:31.39]Where is it?
[290:35.63]Achoo!
[290:38.73]Who cares?
[290:39.15]Yeah, he saves him.
[290:59.01]And then... This is what it means.
[291:07.53]Wait, didn't he just do this?
[291:14.37]I'm so confused right now.
[291:18.27]They already did a knife fight already.
[291:20.21]Alright, we're just going to watch this shit because this is all fucked up.
[291:28.89]Boo.
[291:29.43]Boo.
[291:29.51]Boo.
[291:46.78]Okay, this is gonna be fucking so dumb.
[291:51.07]Alright, we need some screams.
[291:54.13]No, I don't like that.
[292:16.31]You sure all these voices aren't you?
[292:18.17]I've been hearing that.
[292:20.87]They're not me.
[292:21.77]Only these shitty ones are.
[292:22.81]I need screams from a female.
[292:47.57]No, I don't like it.
[292:55.64]There it is, right here.
[293:01.33]She screams.
[293:05.45]Why does she smile?
[293:07.91]She gets a big smile.
[293:40.22]I'm not supposed to put that in.
[293:42.94]I was not supposed to put it in.
[293:44.04]Ah.
[294:30.42]Boo!
[294:31.24]No, no more farts.
[294:37.30]Ah!
[294:52.16]I can't fucking do it anymore.
[294:54.14]This is it.
[294:54.72]After this, I gotta go to fucking bed, man.
[294:56.76]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[294:57.74]I know I'm gonna fucking laugh my ass off at this one.
[295:01.50]Let's just end it with this stupid happy music who gives a shit.
[295:21.59]That's the one we have to use.
[295:32.70]This game has broken me completely.
[295:35.94]And it's going to get worse.
[295:37.22]I know it is.
[295:37.78]What about... No, not turbo power.
[295:42.72]Where does it go?
[295:43.24]Happy, where is it?
[295:48.30]Happy stride.
[295:56.35]No, that's going to be like where it ends here.
[296:03.48]This is long, too.
[296:04.44]This is like the longest one I think we've done.
[296:21.33]Happy stride. 2050.
[296:36.08]These aren't even like music files.
[296:42.02]A big package.
[296:43.26]I feel like this isn't gonna be it.
[296:48.56]Alright, that's fine.
[296:50.68]Save it.
[296:55.31]Spitoui Saloon.
[297:11.91]And we're done.
[297:14.56]Let's go.
[297:15.10]Let's watch this fucking stupid piece of shit.
[297:17.22]I hope you guys are ready to watch.
[297:22.94]Wait, wait, we didn't do the intro.
[297:27.50]Intro's very important.
[297:34.59]Ha!
[297:40.23]Ugh.
[297:44.83]There it is.
[297:45.17]Alright, let's go.
[297:47.41]It's Patoowee Saloon.
[297:50.83]It's ready to watch.
[297:53.64]People died for this.
[297:55.78]Lots of them.
[297:59.08]Release this fucking movie.
[298:05.73]Release it.
[298:07.35]Re-lease!
[298:10.85]Ooh!
[298:13.57]That is our first three star ever.
[298:16.87]And y'all didn't think it was going to be a good movie.
[298:22.87]This is the best one we've made since... Look at this.
[298:25.79]Are you kidding me?
[298:29.61]Alright, here you go.
[298:31.01]This is the fruit of our labor.
[298:33.43]Ladies and gentlemen.
[298:35.24]Spitoui Saloon.
[298:47.75]Ha!
[298:49.64]Ugh.
[299:14.96]You don't know the secret?
[299:15.90]I don't fucking even know.
[299:18.35]What am I even doing?
[299:19.39]Yes, what are we doing?
[299:20.59]I can't believe it.
[299:21.21]He's such a bad guy.
[299:22.49]We need to stop him.
[299:23.47]Don't you understand this?
[299:25.64]It's not funny.
[299:26.84]He has the strongest army in all of Central... Self... Sense... Sense...
[300:01.05]That's a fucking music change
[300:38.71]This is fucking so stupid.
[300:43.52]No, it's on fire!
[301:08.43]Gun.
[301:52.78]I did this.
[301:53.44]I fucking did this.
[302:04.09]I fucking already died.
[302:10.37]Kill him.
[302:38.71]What?
[303:08.16]Ah!
[303:08.30]Ah!
[304:20.97]Oh my god.
[304:46.25]best part about that whole thing was that they did the knife fight and he like fucking slashed him in the stomach and it's disgusting he's on top of them with the fucking knife and he fucking stabs him Santa gets up and grabs him by the neck and then there's an explosion what a fucking fantastic game
[305:17.64]Oh, man.
[305:19.92]This game is like, seriously, like a fucking straight up 10 out of 10.
[305:23.13]This game is unbelievable.
[305:28.07]What a game that was before its time, seriously.
[305:33.33]Okay, hold on.
[305:33.85]Let me just see how many people got hurt.
[305:38.03]We got a rating boost because they all did their own stunts.
[305:44.00]The explosions were just transitions.
[305:57.52]It's like, I didn't know what to put to transition between things happening, so the fucking screen blows up.
[306:06.40]Yeah, I have, like, tears in my eyes right now.
[306:10.22]It was, like, kind of funny.
[306:11.36]Like, I thought it was, like, kind of fucking funny.
[306:14.92]The whole fire there was like, okay, that's kind of funny.
[306:17.09]But when he started choking and he got picked up, once the first explosion happened, it was just done.
[306:21.51]It was over.
[306:23.93]and then the girl coming out too and she like fucking shit her pants like I didn't want to put I forgot I even put that in oh if you get a chance to pick this game up for any reason I please get it nothing was even blowing up the characters would just explode I don't even know why yeah I love when Santa went from being dragged the caravan to driving it
[306:56.76]What a great 94 months.
[307:02.80]Dude, that was the hardest.
[307:05.20]When they switched, I could feel all the air leave my lungs.
[307:12.13]That's the longest it's ever taken in this game so far.
[307:18.17]And I think that's where I'm going to call it.
[307:22.97]It's clear that the cast and director got on well.
[307:27.36]Helen made a poor attempt at doing the stunts.
[307:29.60]Next time, look at me, mom.
[307:31.44]Hire a stunt professional.
[307:35.04]I thought they were actually saying, look at me, mom.
[307:38.42]Next time, look at me, mom.
[307:39.70]Hire a stunt professional.
[307:47.29]Oh, man.
[307:47.89]Alright.
[307:49.67]Before I get out of here.
[307:50.53]Hey, remember that money problem we were having?
[307:53.99]It's about to go completely the other direction.
[307:58.57]Oh, let me pause this.
[308:02.92]That was great fun.
[308:11.72]uh before I get out of here though very special thanks to all you guys watching and of course the new subs that came in masonite big meaty claws nudge suffy for three months ragnam thanks ragnam yeah I'll probably make like 500 600 000 from that we can keep playing that movie was six hours long uh Mr. face thanks for the sub

[308:47.06]I'm delirious right now.
[308:48.32]After the second movie, because like last night, we did a first movie, which was just like the test shitty one that was still kind of funny.
[308:55.68]Second one was funny.
[308:56.55]That one put me over the edge.
[308:58.21]I'm like just, I'm exhausted right now.
[309:02.83]Exhausted.
[309:03.79]So please bear with me while I talk very tiredly talk.

[310:43.58]Tuesday of next week is going to be Last Guardian.
[310:47.42]But we're thinking a little too far ahead at that point.

[310:53.17]But thank you guys for the bits.
[310:54.33]Thanks, Renegade Coaster, for the $10.

[311:32.57]Again, if you want to play this game, if you have a urge to play it,
[311:39.77]I recommend Amazon or eBay I would probably say Amazon because I don't know eBay can get kind of weird with like used copies the uh I think I bought these both new I believe will sarcasm thanks for the 1500 my lungs heard that was incredible yeah you'll you if you will go back and watch that the part where the knife turned for no reason when he like got stabbed and then was on top of Santa
[312:08.32]is like I couldn't even control it all the Eric left left my body but thanks a lot dude and yeah Amazon the movies and the movies stunts and effects expansion I think the movies base game is not more than 15 bucks at this point might be less it might be more depending on where you buy it from if you buy it from like a reseller

[313:21.70]It saps all my energy completely from my body.
[313:25.63]Then I have to go to sleep before I get to go away.
