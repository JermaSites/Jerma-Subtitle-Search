[14:47.95]Oh!
[14:49.92]Hello everybody!
[14:50.68]Hello!
[14:51.59]Welcome to the cockpit of a 737-NG aircraft.
[14:56.41]I will be your captain today.
[14:58.13]Welcome to our all-new show, Flight, in which we put our lives in danger flying a real commercial jet.
[15:05.44]Today, to my right, assisting me is somebody who has no experience and actually they applied to be a flight attendant, but we decided we'd fast track them right up to the cockpit because that's what we like to do at Austin Show Airlines.
[15:19.91]Jerma, why don't you introduce yourself to everybody?
[15:22.19]It's a little nerve-wracking.
[15:23.45]I did apply to be a flight attendant.
[15:24.77]I also said I asked if I was just going to be making balloon animals.
[15:28.22]That's what I thought I was going to be doing, but apparently I was told, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to upgrade you to captain.
[15:33.22]And I said,
[15:34.16]Oh, I don't need my clown costume?
[15:35.94]Yeah.
[15:36.26]You said leave that at home.
[15:37.51]I did, I did.
[15:38.05]I said leave that at home.
[15:40.29]And we ordered these fantastic uniforms here, but unfortunately they send us ship captain uniforms.
[15:45.57]Yeah, these are... You're supposed to have four stripes, but unfortunately we only have two on each shoulder.
[15:55.22]Now folks, I want to let you know something before we get started, okay?
[15:59.32]What we're about to do is extraordinarily dangerous.
[16:02.91]And typically, you see professionals doing this kind of thing.
[16:07.93]Of course.
[16:08.53]But in this particular case, it's a gentleman by the name of Austin and a gentleman by the name of Jerma.
[16:15.00]Operating with only experience that you learned a little bit on YouTube yesterday, didn't you?
[16:18.46]So I downloaded Microsoft Flight Simulator.
[16:21.56]Okay.
[16:22.00]Perfect.
[16:22.74]It's about 400 terabytes, whatever it is.
[16:24.58]Right.
[16:25.22]And I took off.
[16:26.48]It took about 10 minutes in the game.
[16:28.06]Yeah.
[16:28.80]And I didn't really understand how to put the wheels up.
[16:31.85]Right.
[16:32.11]But I think that was enough.
[16:33.37]I think that's enough.
[16:34.39]And then I uninstalled it.
[16:35.41]Right.
[16:35.61]And then you uninstalled it, as any true gamer does when you give up on a game.
[16:40.53]Now, folks, I've got a little bit of experience in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
[16:44.05]Some of you may have watched Hoscord Streams.
[16:47.18]That is where I do most of my flights on Microsoft Flight Sim.
[16:50.31]Now, before we get into...
[16:53.90]the actual flight, we've got something very special that we're doing through the course of these four streams.
[16:59.75]Now, Jeremiah, you're my first co-pilot in this series.
[17:03.33]Tomorrow's gonna be Ludwig, and then December 16th and 17th, we're actually flying the A320.
[17:08.19]Through the course of these four episodes, we're actually, every stream that we're doing is going to be benefiting a charity by the name of the Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation.
[17:21.12]And there's a gentleman here by the name of Ron, who's the founder of the foundation, who I'm going to bring in to talk about it.
[17:28.04]But I think this stream is an excellent opportunity to promote a wonderful cause.
[17:34.77]I'm not going to talk any more about it.
[17:36.09]I want to bring in the founder right here.
[17:38.17]His name is Ron.
[17:39.09]Let's give him a round of applause.
[17:40.31]Thank you.
[17:40.93]Bring him into the cockpit.
[17:42.39]I don't work on my balloon animals.
[17:45.67]in Jerma spot right here.
[17:47.35]So chat, I'm going to have Ron talk about Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation real quickly.
[17:53.62]But so you know, if you miss Ron's speech,
[17:58.07]or you can't hear us for some reason, Exclamation Point Charity has all the information.
[18:03.13]I believe we've got the charity extension running, so you can donate on the screen right there.
[18:07.56]But Ron, I'm gonna turn it over to you.
[18:08.98]Can you tell me a little bit about what Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation, number one, is, and how you found it, and why you do it?
[18:16.90]First of all, thanks for having me.
[18:18.17]Yeah, no worries.
[18:18.75]So, what happened was, I was actually coming to work here in Vegas.
[18:22.61]I actually live in California, so I fly myself, I got my plane, got here, and I completely forgot my phone.
[18:28.01]Oh, no.
[18:28.63]Which, you know, in this day and age, you don't keep numbers up in your head.
[18:32.54]It's in your phone.
[18:33.40]And this black kid comes up to me and says, hey, do you mind if I talk to you?
[18:37.66]I said, no.
[18:38.84]What's going on?
[18:39.58]He goes, you know, I try to talk to all minorities I see at the airport because there's so few of us.
[18:45.01]And I was like, really?
[18:46.43]What do you mean?
[18:47.35]He goes, you know, less than 3% of all airline pilots are black and less than 1% are women.
[18:54.03]I really did not know that.
[18:55.53]And it really stunned me.
[18:56.55]And I said, well, you're talking to the right guy.
[18:58.53]Because what I do for a living is teach airline pilots how to fly.
[19:02.98]And so I brought him to my facility here.
[19:05.42]This is his facility, by the way.
[19:06.80]He owns this plane right here.
[19:08.62]This is all of what I do.
[19:10.66]And so I took him here and showed him around.
[19:13.68]But after he left, it really bothered me.
[19:16.38]Because realistically, you only need a high school degree to become an airline pilot and then go to basically trade schools.
[19:22.62]And the airlines used to require a college degree, but they no longer require that either.
[19:27.15]So if you come here, you train, you learn to become a pilot, and you can get a job that pays $200,000 a year on average.
[19:35.72]So it's a good paying job.
[19:36.88]So I said, if we can go to kids in the inner city and let them know that this is even a possibility for them.
[19:41.72]Because so many kids, they don't know that they can become an airline pilot because they've never been exposed to this.
[19:47.46]So we're going into the schools and talking to these kids.
[19:50.21]And a lot of these kids, you know, they're going to school because they have to, not because they think it will actually lead to a really good living.
[19:56.71]So we're telling them, hey, listen, you get your high school degree.
[20:00.53]Now they're more motivated to go to finish school.
[20:03.13]And we'll pay for you to become an airline pilot.
[20:05.25]That's what the foundation's all about.
[20:06.47]That's wonderful.
[20:07.05]So when people donate and they contribute, it goes to grants to be for education.
[20:13.74]It goes to grants for flight training to get them all the way up to this level.
[20:18.44]Yeah, which when I heard about it, I thought it was a tremendous opportunity and a very natural fit.
[20:22.52]We're flying today.
[20:24.67]to support a good cause.
[20:26.37]So not only this broadcast, but every subsequent broadcast in this series of four, we're going to be supporting Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation.
[20:34.96]Thank you so much.
[20:35.48]With Ron, which we're really super excited for.
[20:37.54]So folks, today we're going to be shouting out your donations.
[20:40.32]So if you'd like to contribute, I believe you can contribute through the Twitch extension, as well as Exclamation Point Charity in the chat.
[20:47.57]To support this wonderful foundation around we really do appreciate you coming on to talk about it Ron's an actual pilot.
[20:53.13]Okay, he's an actual captain He knows what he's doing and he decided he's gonna step off the aircraft and let us fly and let them crash it.
[21:00.33]Yeah Thank you Ron, I appreciate it.
[21:03.21]Give it up for Ron.
[21:03.85]Hearts in the chair.
[21:05.05]Good luck.
[21:07.73]So Yeah, yeah, alright step in the cockpit.
[21:11.48]Let's get let's get things going Alright, so
[21:19.00]So folks, in the chat here, we're going to get things going.
[21:24.04]So today, I'm going to go through my pre-flight here.
[21:31.42]That's better?
[21:32.16]Yeah.
[21:32.67]Maybe we should turn the lights just a little, just dim them a little bit.
[21:36.17]Or do you like that?
[21:37.09]Okay, so very, very important first question I have for you, Austin.
[21:40.35]Yeah.
[21:40.91]How do you put the seatbelt on here?
[21:44.56]Jerma, really?
[21:45.36]You don't know how to put the seatbelt on?
[21:46.56]How do I put the seatbelt on?
[21:47.86]You know what?
[21:48.28]Don't worry about that just yet.
[21:49.88]What?
[21:50.29]I'm going to take you through the cockpit.
[21:51.81]Oh, okay.
[21:52.09]I'm going to give you a little quiz.
[21:53.03]I want to see to what degree, what knowledge you have here.
[21:57.15]Jerma, what is this?
[21:58.75]That is the throttle.
[22:01.73]Nice job.
[22:02.35]That's what I'm talking about.
[22:03.51]Right here, what is this?
[22:04.75]That is the flaps.
[22:06.97]That is the flaps.
[22:07.97]Nice job.
[22:08.57]That's what I'm talking about.
[22:10.09]What's this?
[22:11.35]That is the...
[22:14.64]Landing gear.
[22:15.38]No, that is not the landing gear.
[22:17.76]This is the landing gear right here.
[22:19.46]So what is that?
[22:20.20]This is the speed brake.
[22:21.30]You know that little flappy thing that comes up on the wing when you land?
[22:23.84]Oh, okay.
[22:24.40]That's what that is, right?
[22:25.98]So the brake is down here, right?
[22:27.48]The brakes are right here.
[22:28.42]So they're actually on your toes right here.
[22:29.96]You actually, oh, you just released the parking brake.
[22:32.28]What did I do?
[22:32.86]You just released the parking brake.
[22:33.98]You can't do that.
[22:34.44]We're at the gate right now.
[22:35.30]As you can see, we're at the gate right now.
[22:36.90]Can't release the parking brake.
[22:38.12]That's what happens when you push your toes down.
[22:41.64]So the brakes are down here.
[22:42.94]Hey, Austin.
[22:44.00]Yeah.
[22:44.58]What's that?
[22:45.08]Don't touch it.
[22:46.17]Pressurization right here.
[22:47.37]What's that?
[22:48.11]That is the engine generators.
[22:50.03]What's that?
[22:51.01]Hydraulic pumps.
[22:51.73]What's that?
[22:54.71]Radio stack.
[22:55.43]This is for your instrument landing.
[22:57.23]What's that?
[22:58.68]I'll be honest, I don't know what the hell that is.
[23:00.18]Yeah, you got four out of five.
[23:01.82]Okay, four out of five.
[23:03.80]Here are the lights right here.
[23:05.88]Lights are over here.
[23:07.00]You start the engines with this.
[23:08.64]Oh, hey, you remember that seatbelt sign?
[23:10.69]Yes.
[23:11.21]Hit that right in.
[23:15.57]Isn't that awesome?
[23:16.87]Hey, also hit this one too, Trevor.
[23:18.99]What's this?
[23:20.21]That's no smoking.
[23:21.85]Don't smoke on the airplane.
[23:23.45]You can just leave that off.
[23:24.73]You know what I mean?
[23:25.48]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:26.28]One more time.
[23:28.96]That's fun.
[23:29.60]Yeah, isn't that great?
[23:30.30]So wait, that's and it goes to the whole plane.
[23:31.96]Yeah, obviously.
[23:33.24]Everybody's right now going like, what the fuck is that?
[23:38.88]Seatbelts on, seatbelts off.
[23:41.36]So let me tell you a little bit about what we're doing today so everybody knows.
[23:44.47]So today we are flying this beautiful 737.
[23:47.63]We are currently in Las Vegas, Nevada right now.
[23:49.51]We're sitting at the gate.
[23:50.69]We are going to fly this beautiful bird over to San Francisco, California.
[23:56.80]And as far as the flight is concerned, I think everything should be pretty smooth.
[24:01.62]We have smooth sailing?
[24:02.40]But as I always say with every flight, things can happen.
[24:06.20]You've got to be prepared.
[24:06.90]You've got to be prepared for everything, which is why you have me in the cockpit.
[24:09.45]So first things first, folks.
[24:11.61]Jerma, pay attention here.
[24:12.87]We're gonna program what this is called, Chad, this is called the flight management computer.
[24:18.41]This computer right here,
[24:22.27]Does a lot of cool things that I don't really know.
[24:24.16]I just know it kind of works.
[24:25.22]There you go.
[24:26.08]There you go.
[24:26.46]Now you got your primary flight display showing.
[24:28.72]So here, we're going to put in our route, okay?
[24:30.54]So we're going to Las Vegas, right?
[24:32.76]And we're going to go to KSFO.
[24:35.55]That's San Francisco, California.
[24:37.51]We're going to be taking off from runway 26 right in Las Vegas.
[24:40.49]I thought those were radio stations.
[24:41.91]No.
[24:42.31]Oh, right.
[24:42.57]Yeah.
[24:45.77]No.
[24:46.09]We're going to listen to K-Low.
[24:47.73]No.
[24:48.09]What would this one be called?
[24:53.03]KSFO.
[24:53.99]KSFO.
[24:54.49]The morning show.
[24:56.63]99.3.
[24:56.75]Morning, morning, morning show.
[24:58.13]KSFO.
[25:00.55]Let's put in all this.
[25:02.79]You know, I'm not even going to bother explaining most of this.
[25:05.05]This is our zero fuel weight here.
[25:06.88]Going to do all these fancy calculations.
[25:08.26]You've got a lot of drawings over there.
[25:09.48]Yeah, I've got all these.
[25:10.18]These are charts here, Jerma, that we're going to need right here.
[25:13.40]Wait, I'm the navigator, right?
[25:15.28]Do I need to see these?
[25:15.76]Yeah, you're going to need these in a second here, Jerma.
[25:18.16]I need one of them here.
[25:20.80]They look like you've used them.
[25:22.04]You drew these in a print.
[25:25.00]I don't know what these are.
[25:28.50]Oh, you know what?
[25:30.64]I think I have them over here.
[25:31.80]Austin, I'm looking at this and it's making me want to puke just reading it.
[25:35.32]Well, Jerma, you've got to study up because we're about to be flying here.
[25:39.91]I think in the chat, I'm reading the chat right now, there seems to be a lot of confidence in our ability to... Where are we right now?
[25:47.33]Are we here?
[25:48.39]We are, no, don't worry about, that's the wrong airport, Jerma, actually, that is San Francisco.
[25:53.73]But where are we going to be?
[25:56.09]We're gonna be in San Francisco.
[25:57.57]Can you show me on this map?
[25:59.21]We are landing right,
[26:02.92]I want to see what side.
[26:04.12]We're landing right.
[26:07.56]It's upside down, Austin.
[26:08.80]Oh, that's right.
[26:09.34]Excuse me.
[26:09.96]You're supposed to be the person that knows.
[26:11.68]I couldn't see.
[26:12.34]That was the test, and you failed it.
[26:14.08]2.8 right.
[26:14.62]I'm getting out of here.
[26:15.46]2.8 right.
[26:15.66]No, no, no, no.
[26:16.14]No, no, no, no.
[26:17.24]That was a test, and you failed it.
[26:18.34]We're going to be alright.
[26:19.10]Don't worry.
[26:19.42]Don't worry about it.
[26:20.44]OK.
[26:20.60]Alright.
[26:20.98]It's 112.7.
[26:21.14]I'm going to put 4 there.
[26:22.36]Cost index of 25.
[26:23.60]That's how efficient we are.
[26:31.78]I feel like you're taking orders at a restaurant.
[26:33.64]It is, basically.
[26:34.34]It's a lot of stuff.
[26:35.32]I don't know what altitude we're going to be at.
[26:36.85]Let's see.
[26:37.83]We'll do 32,000 feet.
[26:39.71]That sounds good to me.
[26:41.71]This is what pilots do.
[26:42.65]They just say, that sounds good to me.
[26:45.70]And then they do it.
[26:47.45]And then that's what happens.
[26:48.53]Do we need these or should I put these away?
[26:50.37]Well, it is a hot one.
[26:51.37]It is 67 degrees.
[26:53.01]No, that's not.
[26:54.01]Is that why I'm sweating?
[26:54.75]No, that's not what I meant.
[26:55.75]Alright, I'm going to stick these in a place where we know where they are.
[26:59.07]So, Jerma, you have little experience.
[27:02.10]I don't even know how to put the seatbelt on.
[27:03.68]Microsoft Flight Simulator.
[27:05.22]Yeah, you don't have to put the seatbelt on in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
[27:08.36]Well, we're going to go through a seatbelt tutorial in just one second once we program the plane.
[27:13.15]I'm wrong with my posture.
[27:14.53]Okay.
[27:14.69]Okay.
[27:15.23]Just let me program the flight management computer.
[27:17.47]This is critical chat so that we know
[27:22.35]Exactly where we're going.
[27:23.71]Okay, so let's put in our route here.
[27:25.73]So we're going to go depart.
[27:27.15]So this is what we're programming right here is the departure.
[27:29.99]It's called a SID.
[27:30.71]It's called a Standard Instrument Departure.
[27:32.35]Standard Instrument Departure.
[27:33.29]As you can see here on this map.
[27:35.92]That's us.
[27:36.60]That's us.
[27:37.14]This is the route we're going to take.
[27:38.28]Do you see how it's populating here?
[27:40.10]Yep.
[27:40.28]This is the route we're going to take out of Las Vegas, okay?
[27:42.22]This is the runway we're going to take off from.
[27:43.80]Runway 26 right.
[27:44.08]Select that one.
[27:49.31]your route activate execute okay now Jerma uh wants you to come over here you got it I want you to type this in type it in here no uh you can type it in here yeah what would you like me to press I want you to go here to the only to type uh alright uh type this out for me are you ready is it is it two is it numbers and letters or just letters where'd my paper go I put them on the floor okay
[28:15.13]Where's the one with the writing on it, Jeremy?
[28:16.77]You lost the one with the writing on it.
[28:18.69]You threw the bat.
[28:20.73]This is very critical.
[28:21.83]We can't get out of here without the... Okay.
[28:23.72]Alright, you ready?
[28:24.32]R U
[28:27.40]Hold on, let me see.
[28:30.69]R-U-S-M-E.
[28:36.97]Okay.
[28:37.97]And then hit that button right there.
[28:39.09]Put it right there.
[28:39.49]This second one?
[28:40.21]Yep.
[28:40.85]Okay.
[28:41.13]There you go.
[28:41.91]Now, that's the next.
[28:43.37]And then I want you to go to departure slash arrivals.
[28:46.70]Okay.
[28:47.22]Hit that one right there.
[28:48.28]Arrivals?
[28:48.78]Third one or second one?
[28:49.60]Second one.
[28:50.12]Okay.
[28:50.42]Right there.
[28:51.30]And then hit this one, diamond five.
[28:53.44]There's a light on here.
[28:55.12]Yep.
[28:55.44]We'll ignore that for a second.
[28:57.11]We're going to go ILS 28 right.
[28:58.65]Yep.
[28:59.07]And we're going to just make one of these.
[29:00.97]Oh, ILS 28 right.
[29:01.47]Yeah, of course.
[29:02.33]Yeah, absolutely.
[29:03.05]You knew that.
[29:03.45]I just want to see.
[29:04.79]Yeah, I understand.
[29:09.58]And then I think we'll route out.
[29:11.70]Does it make phone calls?
[29:13.46]Yes.
[29:13.96]You can make phone calls from here?
[29:17.30]What?
[29:17.74]Yeah, you're talking to it.
[29:19.78]Hello?
[29:20.44]Yeah, so they can hear you in the back.
[29:22.84]Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make sure to understand that if you could just make sure to keep all your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.
[29:32.34]Thank you for choosing Universal Studios for all of your entertainment needs.
[29:38.14]Somebody laughed back there, I think.
[29:39.70]No, I think it was fantastic.
[29:41.42]I think it was wonderful.
[29:43.16]Okay, so we'll go diamond here.
[29:47.27]Execute.
[29:47.87]I don't want to drop this.
[29:50.35]No, here.
[29:50.79]I'll fasten it in for you.
[29:54.25]I want to be like the fun co-pilot.
[29:56.13]You want to be the fun one?
[29:57.66]Like the cool parent?
[29:58.92]Yeah.
[29:59.28]You want to be the cool parent?
[30:00.70]Okay.
[30:01.48]Well, Jerma?
[30:04.92]Dispatch, it says our V-speeds are unavailable.
[30:11.21]I'll give you V-speeds.
[30:12.85]Okay.
[30:13.39]Can you give us our V1?
[30:15.95]B1, 136.
[30:16.07]Okay.
[30:16.41]Yep, B2, VR.
[30:16.67]VR, 137.
[30:16.79]Okay.
[30:22.94]Yep.
[30:26.48]It is hot in California today.
[30:30.78]Yeah, no, isn't it?
[30:31.88]No, that's terrain.
[30:33.30]That's terrain.
[30:34.06]So right there is terrain.
[30:36.98]Okay, Jarman, you ready to get your seatbelt on?
[30:39.66]I'm ready to put my seatbelt on.
[30:40.82]Okay, guys, chat, you ready?
[30:42.52]We're just going to get the plane pretty much all the way configured for the most part.
[30:47.04]We just got to do some stuff up here to get ready to take off.
[30:52.89]Alright.
[30:54.23]So Jerma, right here is your seat.
[30:57.25]I got this part, right?
[30:58.35]Yeah.
[30:58.73]So here, make sure you're in the right position.
[31:00.59]Are you in?
[31:01.43]How close should my parotial area be to the unit?
[31:06.13]Just make sure you're comfortable on the rudder pedals.
[31:09.56]So put your feet down there and make sure you can touch the pedals.
[31:13.20]Can you touch the pedals comfortably?
[31:14.76]Wait, there are pedals?
[31:15.54]Yeah, they're pedals.
[31:16.28]I can't reach them.
[31:17.06]You can't reach them?
[31:17.98]Are you serious?
[31:19.40]No, I can't.
[31:19.88]You're joking, right?
[31:21.34]No.
[31:21.62]You can pull your seat forward.
[31:23.90]You can put, you can't reach the pedals.
[31:25.02]Can you like show him doing some cool things with these knobs?
[31:27.22]Yeah, yeah.
[31:28.82]Here, this one right here, see?
[31:31.09]This, and then go in.
[31:32.45]There you go, like that, see?
[31:34.45]And get to a comfortable level.
[31:37.47]are pedals back here?
[31:38.95]Yes.
[31:39.51]Where are they?
[31:40.02]I can't feel them.
[31:41.24]They're right here.
[31:41.84]Oh, I'm going underneath them.
[31:43.24]No.
[31:44.18]Oh, okay.
[31:44.78]I'm better.
[31:46.62]I'm way too close.
[31:47.94]Did you see where my phone went?
[31:49.06]My legs were going underneath.
[31:51.14]You dropped it on the side somewhere.
[31:52.80]I dropped my phone on the side.
[31:54.71]Crisis averted.
[31:55.53]I'm not like four feet, five feet tall.
[31:58.39]Let me get the, where's the phone at?
[32:01.22]You see a phone, Chad?
[32:02.34]Chad, did you see his phone?
[32:03.56]Where?
[32:04.08]It's on the... I just want to get Chad up because one of the number one rules of flying is you got to be able to see Twitch chat, right?
[32:11.61]I want to be able to see Twitch chat.
[32:13.75]Alright.
[32:14.83]Alright.
[32:15.03]Where's my seatbelt?
[32:16.57]Okay, here we go.
[32:17.83]Your seatbelt's like this.
[32:18.59]So, hey, you got shoulder straps, right?
[32:20.77]Uh-huh.
[32:21.53]Go like this.
[32:22.38]Here, pull from the center here.
[32:23.64]From the center?
[32:24.24]Wait, where's my... Okay.
[32:26.02]Is this like a car seat?
[32:27.08]Yeah, it's...
[32:28.83]It is.
[32:29.21]It's like a big car seat.
[32:33.30]It's like a car seat.
[32:34.30]It is.
[32:35.12]So you basically just plug yourself into all the slots.
[32:38.46]So here, Jeremiah, look at this.
[32:40.46]Shoulder straps.
[32:41.84]OK.
[32:43.58]How does that go in here?
[32:44.48]Well, you just go like, just figure it out.
[32:48.29]Be honest.
[32:49.05]It's difficult.
[32:50.51]They don't teach you this in flight simulators, right?
[32:52.85]No, I'm telling you.
[32:53.59]It wasn't in the tutorial.
[32:54.89]No.
[32:55.65]Let's see here.
[32:57.13]Let's get a little bit.
[33:01.52]I'll be honest.
[33:02.02]I don't know how to get the dang seatbelt on either.
[33:03.82]You having trouble with the crotchal area?
[33:05.34]Yeah.
[33:05.64]Well, let's see here.
[33:07.10]Let's get all these.
[33:08.98]Is there maybe a depress down, depress a button?
[33:10.96]Well, no.
[33:11.20]You have to like twist it to release it, I think.
[33:13.90]But I can't get the crotch open.
[33:15.24]This is not good, Jerma.
[33:16.34]We can't even get our seatbelt on.
[33:19.93]I don't know what to do.
[33:20.71]I was supposed to be picking balloon animals back there.
[33:24.61]Well, you know what?
[33:25.99]I think here.
[33:27.24]There we go.
[33:27.64]I got mine on.
[33:29.44]And then there's a crotch one, too.
[33:32.14]Here, let me buckle you in.
[33:34.93]Can you help me?
[33:36.55]I'm strapped in, too, so I can't hear.
[33:38.31]Yours isn't coming out.
[33:39.19]How come mine isn't coming out?
[33:40.11]Well, here.
[33:41.13]Sorry.
[33:41.43]You do what you need to do.
[33:47.74]I'm being buckled into my closet.
[33:49.22]Here, pull that one over there.
[33:50.28]I promise I'm over the age of 30.
[33:51.68]Here, pull that one over here.
[33:53.62]There's two.
[33:58.97]There's over on your right-hand side.
[34:00.55]Is there a lock?
[34:01.63]Yeah.
[34:04.59]Yeah.
[34:05.13]I got these two in.
[34:07.44]This one's... It's almost like it's caught.
[34:12.24]So, let's see here.
[34:14.16]We'll work it out here, Jeremiah.
[34:15.04]Do it at the same time?
[34:15.86]Yeah, I'm going to work on this overhead panel while you work that out, okay?
[34:18.66]Yeah, we got to make sure the pressure's open.
[34:19.88]Yeah, no, it's all okay.
[34:21.04]Don't worry.
[34:22.40]Okay.
[34:23.00]Chat, just ignore what I'm doing.
[34:24.36]This is all...
[34:26.26]There we are.
[34:27.60]Alright.
[34:28.38]Okay, here we go.
[34:29.66]Perfect.
[34:30.14]Alright, you figured it out?
[34:31.36]I got it.
[34:31.82]Okay, now just put those in the slots there, and we'll all be good to go.
[34:36.32]Alright.
[34:37.62]I'm going to do a couple things here and just program the plane to, you know, work.
[34:45.57]Alright?
[34:47.15]So the two go in here?
[34:49.31]Oh, it goes across like this?
[34:52.65]Where did yours go in here?
[34:53.75]Right in here.
[34:56.48]Right in here.
[34:57.04]Okay.
[35:00.82]Let me spend 40 minutes putting a seatbelt on.
[35:02.98]You got it.
[35:04.37]Don't worry.
[35:05.69]We're under control.
[35:06.47]You know, I had this problem last time where I couldn't quite get the APU started.
[35:13.71]Let me go in here.
[35:20.46]Could you take off a glance over here, Captain?
[35:22.62]Yeah, yeah.
[35:23.68]Do I have this wrong?
[35:25.02]Oh, sorry.
[35:25.46]Excuse me.
[35:27.12]I'm so sorry.
[35:28.18]Don't file a complaint with HR.
[35:29.78]That was very inappropriate.
[35:32.04]I need help.
[35:32.70]No, it's all good.
[35:35.26]Austin, I need help.
[35:37.00]There you go.
[35:37.84]But no, where does this one go?
[35:39.16]Oh, wait.
[35:39.80]The shoulder strap?
[35:43.78]Well, you should have...
[35:46.07]You just gotta put them in the holes.
[35:48.05]Are there other holes here?
[35:48.99]There's other holes, yeah.
[35:51.03]I tell you what, Jerma, we're not gonna get very far if you can't get your... Okay, I just pulled them out.
[35:54.47]There it is.
[35:55.01]There's that.
[35:56.15]There should be two holes here.
[35:57.23]There should be two, right?
[35:57.83]Yeah.
[35:59.13]Where the heck are these two holes?
[36:00.58]Well, you know what?
[36:01.98]Worst case, you know what?
[36:03.20]I think you'll be fine with just a lap belt.
[36:06.04]It's like your... Oh, no, it's upside down, isn't it?
[36:08.42]Well, yeah, maybe.
[36:09.54]Is it upside down?
[36:11.88]Austin, it's upside down.
[36:13.62]Oh, is it?
[36:14.08]Oh my goodness, okay.
[36:15.36]You just gotta twist it.
[36:16.32]No, no, no, we're good, we're good.
[36:17.88]You got it?
[36:18.44]Oh yeah, Austin, the whole thing is upside down.
[36:20.02]Okay.
[36:21.64]Alright.
[36:23.48]Okay, I think we're...
[36:27.53]I think we're good for pushback here.
[36:29.71]We're going to put on the, hey, flip that anti-collision light on here.
[36:33.57]There we are.
[36:34.13]Not worried.
[36:34.87]Alright.
[36:35.65]Alright.
[36:36.35]Dispatch, we are ready for push and start.
[36:39.88]So how do we do that?
[36:40.80]Don't worry.
[36:41.58]Dispatch.
[36:42.02]I don't want to touch this.
[36:42.86]Don't touch it.
[36:44.66]Parking brake off.
[36:45.90]Good.
[36:47.84]There we go.
[36:48.52]So we don't want to go that way.
[36:50.20]Nope.
[36:50.46]Don't worry.
[36:51.02]We're going to push back.
[36:51.71]Alright, Jerma.
[36:52.71]So we're going to start the right engine first.
[36:54.39]You got it.
[36:55.07]I'm going to have you flip up this lever when I tell you.
[36:57.95]And it's going to be a little out.
[36:58.97]Don't pull too hard, but it's going to be a little up and out.
[37:01.48]Okay.
[37:01.74]We're going to start the right engine.
[37:04.12]Okay.
[37:05.10]Give it a second.
[37:06.34]And this is going to start to...
[37:08.52]It right here is gonna when this hits 20% when it's 20 20% I want you to pull this pull it out and up.
[37:16.28]Let Yeah, you'll see in a second.
[37:17.65]Alright now out and up all the way.
[37:19.59]Yep, all the way.
[37:20.63]Right.
[37:21.05]Oh, there you go.
[37:22.51]Right.
[37:22.93]Nice job.
[37:23.67]Yes.
[37:24.17]Germany, everybody.
[37:26.25]You're doing a great job.
[37:28.49]You're doing a great job.
[37:29.81]Okay.
[37:30.33]Beautiful.
[37:33.19]Beautiful.
[37:37.17]So the pullback here is going back at a nice speed.
[37:40.45]Yep.
[37:40.71]I like the speed of the car.
[37:42.23]Perfect, yep.
[37:43.17]Okay, now the right engine's starting.
[37:45.45]How fast is it going to go?
[37:47.21]Oh, you just wait.
[37:48.85]It's going to go really fast?
[37:50.85]Yeah.
[37:51.65]Now, Jeremy, if you'd excuse me, we need another engine, okay?
[37:54.29]Oh, there we go.
[37:55.17]We're starting the left one now.
[37:56.63]When this gets to 20%, I want you to flip this one up.
[38:00.23]You got it.
[38:03.27]You want a taxi?
[38:06.17]They're like, to leave?
[38:10.61]They're like, no.
[38:11.59]20, 20, 20%, 20%.
[38:11.97]There you go, flip it up.
[38:14.08]Good thing you caught that, because if you don't turn it on, it'll explode.
[38:18.34]It's true.
[38:19.50]It's very true.
[38:20.56]I thought you were like, hey, you want a taxi, man?
[38:22.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[38:24.60]We're going in the air, Jeremy.
[38:25.58]This is going to be quite the experience.
[38:27.94]Oh, my goodness.
[38:31.32]Alright, so we are pulling back.
[38:34.10]Okay, there we go.
[38:34.92]I'm going to flip those to continuous here.
[38:37.32]Second engine is going to be activated.
[38:39.26]It's already on.
[38:40.62]We need to flip the generator.
[38:42.56]So right now we're flipping the generators from the APU.
[38:44.46]It's the auxiliary power unit in the pack.
[38:47.78]Now the engines are running, so we can turn that APU off.
[38:51.00]Alright, we need to turn our hydraulics on.
[38:52.98]Okay, you got that?
[38:54.28]Turn our packs on.
[38:54.98]This is so our passengers can breathe, okay?
[38:57.36]Make sure to put the seatbelts on.
[39:00.90]Oh, you know what?
[39:01.42]Hey, you want to call the ladies back there?
[39:03.18]Poor guys.
[39:05.01]There you go.
[39:06.13]Boom.
[39:07.53]Alright, cool.
[39:08.15]That's when you call the... Alright.
[39:09.63]Okay, Jerma, I need you to give me flaps five, please.
[39:11.67]Flaps five?
[39:12.13]What's that mean?
[39:13.55]This to five degrees.
[39:14.84]To five degrees.
[39:15.78]So this is how you do it.
[39:16.50]I'll show you.
[39:20.97]right okay just pretend I did yeah okay so that when I tell you flaps that's what you're gonna do I feel like this is like a tie fighter it's like yeah it's pretty cool so let me give you a little I didn't even tell you how to do this alright so this this goes right right feel that okay now turn it left
[39:40.79]Don't push.
[39:41.37]That's what it feels like.
[39:42.49]Now push forward all the way.
[39:44.69]That's nose down.
[39:45.88]Pull back.
[39:46.90]That's nose up.
[39:47.62]I remember this.
[39:48.42]Okay.
[39:48.94]Remember this from flight sim?
[39:50.40]Okay.
[39:50.90]Now if you want to trim the airplane.
[39:56.88]So look at my hand.
[39:57.72]See my hand?
[39:58.24]That was scary.
[39:58.92]You have one too.
[39:59.79]Wait, I can do that?
[40:01.81]What does that do besides make a fun noise?
[40:03.53]It trims.
[40:04.21]So you know what an elevator is?
[40:06.55]Yeah.
[40:07.15]Not like the one that you ride in.
[40:08.25]Oh.
[40:10.46]On a plane, it's like, okay, I might be stupid, but I'm not that stupid.
[40:14.54]There's a rudder, elevator, right?
[40:19.71]So when you trim it,
[40:22.04]I think this is right.
[40:23.72]I don't know.
[40:24.06]It could be wrong.
[40:25.20]But when you trim it, you trim the elevator so it's not so difficult to pull back.
[40:29.88]Right.
[40:30.34]Right?
[40:30.57]So if I press down here, it'll... Right.
[40:32.17]So we're trimming it.
[40:33.31]You see where this... Do you have one on your side?
[40:35.63]Yeah, you do.
[40:36.27]See where it says 5?
[40:36.87]Yep.
[40:37.19]So we're trimming it to 5.0.
[40:38.33]So it makes it a little easier for us to take off.
[40:41.83]Okay?
[40:42.31]This is really... This is like one of the coolest things I've ever done in my whole life.
[40:46.00]Yeah, isn't this amazing?
[40:46.90]This is... It's awesome.
[40:48.28]And you didn't even need anything to... Oh, I forgot to set this up.
[40:50.66]This is our...
[40:52.53]I probably should do this.
[40:53.35]This is our autopilot right here, which we're going to definitely use because God knows I want to fly the whole thing.
[40:58.73]What radio station do you want on?
[40:59.81]Don't worry about it.
[41:00.85]Don't worry about the radio.
[41:02.74]You can flip to whatever you want to listen to.
[41:04.46]What kind of music do you like?
[41:08.52]I like a little bit of classic rock.
[41:10.06]A little classic rock?
[41:11.92]Okay.
[41:12.26]92.3 I think is what we got.
[41:13.30]A little classic rock here.
[41:15.38]This is not going to cause us a dangerous scenario.
[41:18.22]No.
[41:18.50]No.
[41:18.62]Worst case scenario is we all crash and die.
[41:20.38]It's okay.
[41:21.58]Everything will be alright.
[41:22.46]Don't worry about it, Jeremiah.
[41:23.40]I mean, I've done this before.
[41:24.50]Okay.
[41:25.26]We did it with a son.
[41:27.24]And it was perfectly okay.
[41:29.45]So, are we taking off?
[41:32.97]Well, we got a taxi.
[41:34.11]Oh, right, right, right.
[41:34.91]Okay.
[41:35.11]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:35.79]That would make any sense.
[41:36.49]Before we taxi, can you turn on the taxi lights, please?
[41:46.36]That's pretty good.
[41:47.26]You are pretty good.
[41:47.88]Are you ready to taxi?
[41:49.66]I'm ready.
[41:50.82]Okay.
[41:51.50]Parking brake is off.
[41:53.20]Oh, that's the auto brake.
[41:55.95]So if we pull back the throttles on takeoff, we have to reject the takeoff.
[41:58.83]The brakes will automatically come on for us.
[42:00.47]Okay.
[42:00.99]Okay.
[42:01.31]Let's get... Oh, you know what?
[42:06.47]They're talking to us.
[42:07.27]We need to put our headsets on.
[42:08.67]Oh, what are you doing over here?
[42:19.45]Alright.
[42:21.13]Sir, he said we're clear to taxi.
[42:22.64]Is that what I heard?
[42:23.38]Yeah.
[42:23.76]Flight, Austin Show Airlines 101.
[42:26.04]Clear to taxi runway 26R via Charlie.
[42:29.34]Can we get that altimeter?
[42:31.08]What did he say?
[42:34.04]Altimeter 2992.
[42:34.56]Altimeter 2992.
[42:36.20]Austin Show Air 0101.
[42:37.38]Okay.
[42:39.82]You ready?
[42:40.48]You ready, Jerva?
[42:41.29]I'm ready.
[42:47.00]So how are you doing that?
[42:48.88]That's the throttle.
[42:49.50]That's the throttle.
[42:50.54]And I'm actually steering with this right here.
[42:53.50]Oh, you're steering with that.
[42:54.64]So I'm actually steering with, this is a, they call it a tiller.
[43:02.20]So that's the gas.
[43:03.88]No, this is the gas.
[43:05.16]Not on your feet.
[43:05.96]Normally on a car, your gas is... So what are these two things down at both feet?
[43:10.46]That's to control the rudder.
[43:12.71]So we're actually turning here.
[43:16.95]We're trying to get to taxiway Charlie.
[43:18.95]You know what it feels like?
[43:19.97]It feels like my whole body is in a VR machine.
[43:23.22]I feel like my whole body is surrounded by a bunch of units.
[43:28.12]Yeah, that's what real life is, Jerma.
[43:31.23]That's what real life is.
[43:34.19]You know what I mean?
[43:35.64]That's how you know you've been playing too many video games.
[43:38.30]When you're outside in nature and you're like, oh my god, this feels like I'm in a full body VR.
[43:50.09]It does, and you know what, it's being up in the cockpit like this.
[43:54.04]Right.
[43:54.40]Never had that experience before.
[43:55.80]No.
[43:56.10]It's always, as a passenger, and it's like, okay, but being up here in the front of this aircraft is, now we're going a little faster.
[44:03.52]Yeah, don't worry, don't worry, we're just, we're taxiing down to the end of the runway here.
[44:06.82]So the runway's off to our right here, and we're here in Las Vegas.
[44:11.24]Las Vegas, Nevada, most known for gambling, and what else?
[44:16.88]It's a beautiful mountain range.
[44:17.89]Is somebody running an ad?
[44:19.21]Oh yeah, Mods, you gotta run an ad throughout the shows?
[44:23.28]Or throughout the show?
[44:26.27]And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, before we take off, I do want to let everybody know that we are supporting a wonderful foundation, the Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation.
[44:34.67]You can donate via the Twitch extension, exclamation point charity, to find out more.
[44:40.73]Sending underrepresented folks through getting the proper education to become an airline pilot because the airline industry is a little bit...
[44:51.62]There's a lot of under-representation in the airline industry, so it's a great foundation.
[44:55.10]Exclamation point.
[44:56.36]Charity.
[44:57.68]In the chat.
[45:00.11]And by the way, for the record, the Wi-Fi these days is phenomenal, which has enabled us to stream this all the way up to 32,000 feet.
[45:07.81]Which is unbelievable.
[45:08.91]Yeah, it's crazy.
[45:10.49]Alright.
[45:10.84]So we're going this way?
[45:12.24]Yeah, we're going this way.
[45:13.62]Whoa, hello.
[45:17.18]Whoa, got to get new tires, you know what I mean?
[45:19.88]Whoa, here we go.
[45:20.66]Looks pretty good here.
[45:21.90]Whoa, yeah.
[45:22.54]So we're going to stop, and then we're going to ask for takeoff clearance.
[45:25.04]Alright.
[45:26.70]Put on the brakes.
[45:27.34]There we go.
[45:27.78]Alright.
[45:28.30]Alright, Jerma, why don't you say Austin Show Airlines, short of runway 26R, ready for takeoff?
[45:38.41]Austin Show runway is ready for takeoff.
[45:40.39]Jerma, Jerma, you're making that announcement to the cabin.
[45:43.29]Shouldn't they know, too?
[45:44.57]Well, no, but they don't need to know that you're taking off.
[45:46.61]This is what you need to do.
[45:50.08]Flight attendants, please be seated for departure.
[45:51.78]Please be seated.
[45:52.40]That's exactly what you need to do.
[45:53.52]That was perfect.
[45:54.30]You need to talk to the air traffic controller.
[45:56.00]What do I need to say?
[45:56.78]You need to say, uh, Austin show, 101...
[46:00.83]Requesting takeoff clearance runway 26R.
[46:03.61]Austin show 101 requesting takeoff clearance from uh... uh... uh... street number two... what was the number again?
[46:13.58]26R.
[46:13.72]26R.
[46:13.82]That's close enough.
[46:14.82]Austin show 101 cleared takeoff runway 26R.
[46:18.48]The card has filed.
[46:24.76]Uh, then you read it back.
[46:26.02]So you say clear for takeoff 26R.
[46:27.14]Clear for takeoff 26R.
[46:28.14]Uh...
[46:32.53]That's good.
[46:33.77]That's good.
[46:35.75]Don't say that.
[46:36.93]No, no, don't say everything that I say.
[46:39.06]Just know the difference between, you know what I mean?
[46:42.62]You're doing all of my chores.
[46:45.56]I'm just sitting here like, alright, you ready?
[46:47.54]You ready to take off?
[46:48.36]I'm ready.
[46:48.58]I'm ready.
[46:48.84]Go for it.
[46:49.26]Let's go for it.
[46:49.76]Alright.
[46:50.06]We got to get on the runway here.
[46:59.97]So Jerma, I want to, I want to, I'm going to have you push the button.
[47:04.65]It's called Toga.
[47:05.65]Toga.
[47:06.27]Not like, you know, have you heard Toga before?
[47:08.57]I've heard the word.
[47:10.43]Like Toga.
[47:11.53]Toga.
[47:12.61]It's not like that.
[47:13.79]So Toga in aviation stands for takeoff go around.
[47:17.19]Alright.
[47:17.43]And it basically sets the throttle to the pre-calculated percentage that you put in this flight management computer.
[47:22.41]So takeoff thrust that we calculated here in the flight management.
[47:24.97]Takeoff thrust.
[47:25.87]Right.
[47:26.71]So we're going to go straight.
[47:27.51]You see this?
[47:28.23]Yeah.
[47:29.57]Alright, Jerma, you ready to go?
[47:32.07]I'm ready.
[47:34.65]Alright.
[47:35.01]Ready, Captain.
[47:35.73]Alright, so we're going to get up to about 40%, and then I'm going to have you... You see this button right here?
[47:40.79]Let me make sure we're all good.
[47:41.73]Okay.
[47:43.45]Do you see this button right here?
[47:47.68]It's right here.
[47:48.14]It's the black one.
[47:48.64]That button right there?
[47:49.60]Yeah, I'm going to have you push that when we get to a certain point, okay?
[47:53.08]I'm really good at pressing buttons.
[47:54.60]Yeah, that's good.
[47:56.40]Alright.
[47:56.80]Alright, Jerma, go ahead and push that button.
[47:59.30]Press the button?
[47:59.82]Yep.
[48:00.26]And watch what happens.
[48:01.23]Look.
[48:01.73]Whoa.
[48:03.53]Okay, now put your hand with me.
[48:05.47]Hand with me on the... There we go.
[48:07.11]Perfect.
[48:07.71]That's about as good as we're going to get, Jerma.
[48:09.47]Alright.
[48:10.15]Make sure we're still on the runway.
[48:11.55]Yeah, don't worry.
[48:12.13]I'm going to keep it steady, okay?
[48:15.04]See that pink line?
[48:16.42]That's what we're going to follow.
[48:17.64]Pink line.
[48:18.18]When we hit V1, we're going to take our hands off of the throttle and put both hands on the yoke.
[48:24.63]Alright.
[48:25.05]Okay.
[48:25.47]The yoke is this.
[48:26.39]V1.
[48:26.55]Yep.
[48:27.05]Alright.
[48:27.67]V1.
[48:28.17]V1.
[48:28.53]Ready to rotate.
[48:30.15]There we go.
[48:31.35]Alright.
[48:31.67]I have control.
[48:32.95]Rotated.
[48:33.47]There we go.
[48:34.19]We're up.
[48:34.65]Now let's bring it up to the center of the pink line there.
[48:37.35]Okay.
[48:37.75]Gear up.
[48:38.17]There we go.
[48:39.43]Gear up.
[48:39.87]Landing gear up.
[48:40.67]Okay.
[48:41.03]There we go.
[48:41.53]Now we're out.
[48:42.31]Okay.
[48:42.59]We're flying.
[48:43.39]We're flying.
[48:44.09]We're up.
[48:44.87]We're up.
[48:46.29]We are up.
[48:47.09]Wait.
[48:47.23]We're up.
[48:47.83]We are up.
[48:48.89]We're up.
[48:49.53]We're up.
[48:50.93]We are up!
[48:51.77]Wow!
[48:52.67]Oh my gosh, isn't that great?
[48:54.95]It really wasn't that hard, was it?
[48:56.45]No, that was really hard.
[48:57.37]It really wasn't that hard.
[48:58.83]It's super easy.
[49:00.55]Especially on such a smooth day in Las Vegas, Jerma.
[49:03.03]Can you imagine if this was going over the radio?
[49:06.16]Yeah.
[49:07.08]Oh wow, it's that easy!
[49:09.20]That's kind of easy.
[49:09.96]What's that do?
[49:10.58]Alright, give me Flaps 1, please.
[49:12.32]Flaps 1.
[49:13.06]Flaps 1.
[49:13.60]Flaps 1.
[49:15.26]That's what I'm thankful for.
[49:17.26]Flaps 5.
[49:17.60]Flaps 1.
[49:17.90]Okay, you know, bring them all the way up for me, Jerma.
[49:20.96]That's how Vegas is you know because the mountains you know and everything it just makes it so difficult to
[49:40.29]So there we go.
[49:41.35]So right now it feels like you go to the arcade and you play the arcade machine that you have to sit down and drive the car machine and you put it on automatic and it just kind of drives the car for you.
[49:55.02]I'm flying it right now though.
[49:57.24]Oh, yeah.
[49:57.80]Wait, that's, oh.
[49:58.78]Yeah.
[49:59.40]I mean, watch.
[49:59.96]You're doing that.
[50:02.67]I just did that.
[50:03.99]It feels like I'm flying.
[50:04.85]Yeah, I'm flying.
[50:05.35]Wow.
[50:05.51]Yeah, I'm flying it right now.
[50:08.05]You're good at this.
[50:09.03]Yeah.
[50:09.51]You want to fly for a second?
[50:10.21]Sure.
[50:10.45]Alright.
[50:11.11]So do you see the, I mean, it's pretty easy.
[50:13.68]You see the, keep that little black thing in the middle of that diamond, or the pink, what do you call it, the flight director?
[50:22.90]Right there?
[50:23.56]Yeah, turn right.
[50:24.32]Now it's going to start to see the map there.
[50:27.58]Okay.
[50:28.80]Alright.
[50:29.44]Don't fight me on it.
[50:31.50]I want to throw the Xbox.
[50:33.45]No.
[50:34.27]No, don't fight me on it.
[50:35.21]Alright, you see that black thing?
[50:38.32]She got the two things going out like that.
[50:40.32]Uh-oh.
[50:40.92]Traffic.
[50:42.61]We've got traffic here.
[50:44.49]It means there's another aircraft coming.
[50:46.69]Do you see that out there, Jerma, right out there on the windscreen to the left?
[50:49.95]See the green and red lights?
[50:51.43]That's a plane that we probably should be avoiding.
[50:53.78]Yes, we should.
[50:56.26]And it's descending right into us.
[50:58.72]What?
[50:59.32]Yeah.
[51:00.22]So, I actually don't know.
[51:02.58]What do you mean it's descending into us?
[51:05.85]Okay, we're going to...
[51:08.73]What was that?
[51:09.37]I don't know, but we need to get... Oh, shoot.
[51:10.99]We're coming right... It's right over there.
[51:13.23]Austin, that is a... That's an Airbus A380.
[51:16.23]Okay, we're clear of it.
[51:17.67]Holy hell.
[51:19.19]Okay.
[51:20.37]Oh, my God.
[51:21.09]That was scary.
[51:22.33]That was scary.
[51:24.27]I tell you what.
[51:25.77]Can we go that way and wrap around?
[51:27.91]No, so we're heading to San Francisco right now.
[51:30.41]Okay.
[51:33.15]Alright, Jerma, let's kick on the autopilot here.
[51:36.28]Okay.
[51:37.46]uh here just let go really really cool so that's pretty easy huh that was exhilarating so now we're now we're up let's take a look at the chat here real quick oh I think my phone's right here Austin thank you Chad how you doing back there oh you know what the autothrottle came off you're going a little too fast yeah but you know what right now so right now there's there's altitude restrictions uh
[52:05.92]So let's try to get clear to 32,000 feet.
[52:08.09]Las Vegas departure, request flight level 320.
[52:11.59]Clear to 320.
[52:11.97]So we're going to delete these altitude restrictions right here.
[52:23.06]We're going to go straight up to, oops, sorry.
[52:25.76]Delete to 320.
[52:28.24]Boom.
[52:30.58]You know what, Jerma?
[52:33.84]One thing I'm so happy about is that we don't have any rough air.
[52:40.00]That is actually really nice.
[52:42.62]That's really nice.
[52:43.58]In fact, I think I'm going to turn off the seatbelt sign.
[52:45.74]I think people could ask me.
[52:47.38]Right.
[52:47.64]Move about the cabin.
[52:49.43]Hey, when you're on an airplane, what do you order on an airplane for a drink?
[52:53.51]When I order what?
[52:54.39]What do you order on an airplane for a drink?
[52:57.57]Like Sprite?
[52:58.97]I usually order a little bit of a... Why is it the L down?
[53:02.87]Oops.
[53:04.29]I feel bumps.
[53:05.51]Oh yeah, we are getting, it is getting a little bumpy.
[53:08.93]But not too bad, right?
[53:10.00]I mean, it's not too bad.
[53:11.16]Las Vegas is windy.
[53:12.22]Yeah, it's a little bit.
[53:13.34]It's not too...
[53:14.89]I mean, it's definitely a little bumpy, actually.
[53:18.01]Let's make sure.
[53:20.81]This thing is spinning all kinds of ways.
[53:23.67]This thing is making silk.
[53:25.79]Yeah, so it's auto-trimming the airplane right now.
[53:29.15]So it's trimming the plane.
[53:30.37]So what that means is it's getting it into a position, adjusting the nose and everything like that to make it so... What do you call it?
[53:42.21]It's just doing what we want it to do.
[53:44.75]Does that make sense?
[53:47.37]Yeah.
[53:47.55]So, yeah, and this is literally what pilots do.
[53:50.66]They get up to cruise altitude, and they just let it do its thing.
[53:55.10]You know what I mean?
[53:55.90]You know, honestly, I'll be really, really completely upfront.
[53:58.84]Yeah.
[53:59.44]This is actually an unbelievable experience.
[54:02.92]Really?
[54:03.44]Because you just don't know what's going on up here in a plane.
[54:07.95]You just don't know.
[54:08.79]Aviation is actually, this is very, very, very cool.
[54:12.61]Isn't this cool?
[54:13.17]This is really cool stuff.
[54:14.55]I think you are unlocking a new interest.
[54:17.11]You think you're going to become an airline pilot?
[54:19.67]Look what we're doing right now.
[54:20.75]Yeah, I know.
[54:21.33]That's what I'm saying.
[54:22.48]This could be you.
[54:24.00]Let's see what the chat's saying.
[54:25.22]Austin Air, please correct to your desired flight plan.
[54:32.72]Roger, we'll get on our... Oh, yeah.
[54:33.96]Sorry about that.
[54:35.87]Sorry about that.
[54:37.83]Let's correct here to our... We need to get on that.
[54:41.27]Get intercepted.
[54:42.09]Where are we?
[54:43.73]Are we on the wrong path?
[54:45.13]I don't know where the hell we are, but let's get to a better path.
[54:47.61]We're just driving in a straight line.
[54:49.94]We were going the wrong way is what we were doing.
[54:52.44]But now we're good.
[54:54.39]Yeah, I think we're doing... I think we're good.
[54:57.45]Alright.
[54:57.81]Oh, you know what?
[54:58.51]I didn't even turn my... That makes so much sense.
[55:03.79]I didn't have my transponder on.
[55:06.02]No transponder?
[55:06.92]What's a transponder do?
[55:08.40]A transponder is... Oh, I just disconnected the auto.
[55:16.34]We're good.
[55:16.94]We're good.
[55:18.58]We're good.
[55:20.88]What was that?
[55:21.44]That's the autopilot.
[55:22.94]That wasn't the cow from the thing that you, the little, the kid's toy?
[55:25.97]Nope, it's all good.
[55:26.79]You know the thing, you pull the thing and it goes... Yep.
[55:30.81]Okay.
[55:33.55]Oh, man.
[55:34.39]Jerma, we are on our way.
[55:36.34]It's on our way to San Francisco.
[55:37.68]What's the flight time from right now to San Francisco?
[55:41.12]Uh...
[55:43.23]I think we're going to increase the speed so we get there a little faster.
[55:46.89]We're going to go faster?
[55:48.02]Yeah, we're going to go a little faster.
[55:49.50]Okay.
[55:50.02]So, I'm going to make sure that we clock this baby about as fast as we possibly can go.
[55:54.88]Are we going to go astronaut speed?
[55:56.02]Probably about twice the speed that you're normally supposed to go.
[55:58.46]Two and a half times the speed that you're normally supposed to go to.
[56:01.71]Chad, what do you think about that?
[56:03.17]Is that okay for our organs?
[56:05.35]What do you guys think about that?
[56:07.17]What are they saying?
[56:08.47]They say, MonkaW, light speed.
[56:13.29]Hyperdrive, Wicked.
[56:15.57]What is it, a hyperdrive?
[56:18.32]You want to go, okay.
[56:20.92]And how we doing, chat, with donations?
[56:23.22]I can't see them on my phone here.
[56:25.87]Yeah, how we doing?
[56:26.57]But I'd like to take a look here how we're doing with donations.
[56:30.83]We have raised $6,000 for Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation.
[56:35.47]That is awesome, guys.
[56:37.21]Wow, that is great.
[56:38.79]That is so cool.
[56:40.49]Oh, my God, we got a $5,000 donation.
[56:43.18]That's unbelievable.
[56:45.40]Wow, that's awesome, guys.
[56:46.96]Thank you so much.
[56:48.80]If you're just joining in, this broadcast is supporting Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation.
[56:55.80]which is an amazing foundation that helps underrepresented minorities and folks that are underrepresented in the uh in aviation get educated and get the uh the proper requirements to be able to become an airline pilot and they do great they do great work they do wonderful work and in smooth flights like this Jeremiah like to go like this turn off that seat belt sign let them let them chill and roll around the cabin
[57:20.11]But also be ready to switch that back on.
[57:22.65]Anything happens.
[57:23.45]Any moment.
[57:24.75]It seems like every time we switch it off, it starts to get bumpy.
[57:28.52]Are you turning on turbulence?
[57:30.36]Oh, my God.
[57:32.58]Actually, yeah.
[57:33.98]Every time we turn it on.
[57:35.92]That would be so frustrating if you were in back of the main cabin.
[57:38.97]Oh, fuel.
[57:39.91]Since I'm getting a fuel notification.
[57:41.49]Oh, fuel?
[57:42.95]Oh, yeah, we ran out of fuel.
[57:44.83]So now what?
[57:45.57]Now we just lost one in one of the tanks.
[57:47.43]We're good.
[57:48.35]Don't worry.
[57:49.29]How many tanks does a plane have?
[57:51.22]A few.
[57:52.99]They've got a few tanks.
[57:54.09]So they've got center tanks here, and they've got side tanks and tanks here as well.
[58:01.00]There's a fan?
[58:02.00]You know what, Jerma?
[58:02.98]I'm going to give you the chance to push any button you want to push.
[58:06.59]Any button in the whole cockpit?
[58:07.69]Any button you want to push in the whole cockpit.
[58:11.39]This is actually a huge opportunity.
[58:13.93]I'm not going to tell you what it does, but I'm just going to let you push it.
[58:18.00]Okay.
[58:19.44]You know, I always see people do this.
[58:21.04]They like kind of flip.
[58:21.98]They flip this, right?
[58:22.96]Yeah.
[58:23.48]They flip that.
[58:24.52]Okay.
[58:26.43]What?
[58:27.41]They flip this thing and they go like.
[58:28.85]Okay.
[58:29.47]What happened?
[58:36.89]That's, you just, you don't want those.
[58:39.65]That's the emergency lights.
[58:41.28]We want to make sure that those are armed.
[58:43.72]Okay, that was a good flip, a good button flip.
[58:49.50]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[58:52.62]Dude, what if I just went like... I mean, that would be something.
[58:56.74]That would be absolutely something.
[59:00.07]Yeah, no, this is not the... Well, it's a little smoother.
[59:05.09]So, chat, normally we would cruise and we're at Mach .7, but we're gonna probably, I think we're gonna go a little faster, because I don't want you guys to be sitting here watching us go to San Francisco at the normal speed, so we're gonna,
[59:21.89]Speed it up just a little bit.
[59:23.51]This is kind of nice.
[59:24.62]Do you like this little nice cruise speed?
[59:26.32]This is nice.
[59:26.96]This is a nice cruise speed.
[59:28.84]It's very nice.
[59:29.54]But if you want to take us to Mach 5 or whatever it is.
[59:33.26]Mach 5 would be an unrealistic speed to sustain.
[59:36.56]Okay.
[59:38.08]So do you have any questions, Jeremy, about what's going on?
[59:40.30]A hundred.
[59:41.14]Okay, a hundred.
[59:42.25]Give me your first question.
[59:43.41]First question I have.
[59:44.29]It's a very important question.
[59:45.31]Okay.
[59:46.60]These, this here, this pink line, that is essentially our GPS navigation system.
[59:52.53]That is it, yeah.
[59:53.49]So, one of the things that I was always curious about airplanes was, how do the pilots know exactly where the hell they're going?
[60:00.49]Because everything is so open.
[60:01.77]Like, we, honestly, the visibility... Yeah, it's a perfect example.
[60:04.51]It's not like driving on a road, right?
[60:06.12]Yeah.
[60:06.62]So it's like, oh yeah, take a left on this street, and then a right down... You have to know where you're going.
[60:10.38]Well, the cool thing is that I see PogChamps...
[60:13.65]coming through the chat here.
[60:14.83]A lot of PogChamps.
[60:16.91]Is it before the flight when I was programming into the computer?
[60:21.13]Look at this.
[60:21.95]This is our entire route that we programmed all the way to San Francisco.
[60:26.02]You see that?
[60:26.46]If you want to zoom yours out, you can do that too.
[60:30.06]Boom.
[60:31.02]Like that as well.
[60:32.00]But I guess I never realized just how
[60:35.29]intricately detailed the navigation system is in.
[60:37.71]Yeah, so there's like different intersections as we go.
[60:40.13]So right now we're going to Deadpool, I think.
[60:45.08]I love that guy.
[60:46.02]Yeah, and they name a lot of these intersections after like, I don't think that's actually called Deadpool.
[60:51.36]but but anyhow they name a lot of intersections off of certain things so like like uh the the the departures like out of Las Vegas is like the joker really there's a Portland one the timbers which is named after the soccer team it's it's pretty cool so so as we get to this kind of
[61:11.64]There's a plane here on this.
[61:13.84]Is that another plane?
[61:15.12]No, that's not another plane.
[61:16.43]It's shaped like a plane.
[61:18.47]Should we encounter some traffic up here, which I think could be likely given how, you know,
[61:26.51]It'll appear on the screen.
[61:28.09]Because this is San Francisco, Vegas, there's planes in and out.
[61:30.67]Yeah, there's planes kind of silly in and out.
[61:32.62]So if you were to have multiple planes on this, which very well could happen, a lot of times that happens at cruise altitude.
[61:38.98]When you see planes and they'll appear on a, you remember what happened when we took off, right?
[61:44.60]Is there was a, it'll appear as a diamond, and the plane has this thing called TCAS, Traffic Collision Avoidance System.
[61:52.59]Really?
[61:53.01]Yeah.
[61:53.39]And so it'll, it'll, oh, see, there you go.
[61:55.63]Just like, you see that +2 six?
[61:58.73]That means there's a plane right here.
[62:00.35]That was a choo-choo train.
[62:01.61]Yeah.
[62:02.15]See, +2 four, it's 2,300 feet.
[62:04.70]It's right over there.
[62:06.88]Uh, actually, I don't know where it is.
[62:09.36]Uh, it's, it's descending.
[62:11.48]It's up here.
[62:12.56]Yeah, and it's descending towards us.
[62:16.32]See?
[62:16.54]Uh-huh.
[62:17.72]So should we, should we go left?
[62:19.06]Traffic, traffic.
[62:21.18]Uh...
[62:22.40]I actually am not sure what to do.
[62:23.74]Descend.
[62:24.46]Descend.
[62:25.48]Okay, that's... What?
[62:26.59]Whoa!
[62:27.39]Hold on, hold on.
[62:28.11]You have to... Austin!
[62:29.97]Austin!
[62:30.83]It's telling me to descend.
[62:31.87]We have to descend.
[62:34.05]There's a train coming.
[62:35.47]Adjust vertical speed.
[62:37.39]What do you mean?
[62:39.01]Oh, Jesus.
[62:41.36]Oh, shit.
[62:41.70]Hold on, hold on.
[62:42.50]I got control.
[62:43.46]You got it?
[62:43.84]I got control.
[62:44.66]I did a little too much there.
[62:46.48]Too much thrust.
[62:47.22]Admittedly, a little less thrust.
[62:48.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:49.42]Shh, shh.
[62:51.45]You've got to stabilize it here.
[62:53.51]Hold on.
[62:54.11]You've got to stabilize it.
[62:55.15]Okay.
[62:56.31]Now that plane's... Stabilize it.
[62:57.21]Hold on.
[62:57.43]Okay.
[62:59.21]That was a little too aggressive on my part.
[63:01.83]Okay.
[63:02.21]Admittedly.
[63:03.11]Okay, it's still a little aggressive.
[63:04.35]We're going to go on a boat.
[63:06.03]We're just getting there.
[63:07.39]We're on a cruise ship.
[63:08.33]We're dressed like cruise ships.
[63:09.61]I know.
[63:09.87]We're on a cruise ship.
[63:10.77]I need to get the plane under control.
[63:12.08]Alright.
[63:14.06]Let's just... There we go.
[63:17.68]Okay.
[63:17.78]Okay.
[63:17.90]That was a little scary.
[63:19.96]So a lot of times what happens when you are flying, there are some situations in which you have traffic.
[63:39.72]Crossing, right?
[63:40.77]Crossing traffic.
[63:42.91]And you need to descend to avoid colliding with them.
[63:46.69]Okay?
[63:47.19]Not like this.
[63:47.93]Not like that.
[63:49.13]Not like that.
[63:49.91]Right?
[63:50.19]That was a little dangerous.
[63:53.13]Admittedly, a little bit dangerous, but it's okay, because we got it under control.
[63:58.17]Oops.
[63:58.73]Sorry.
[63:59.38]Okay, did you do that?
[64:00.44]Yeah.
[64:01.18]Okay.
[64:01.78]I pressed the button a little hard.
[64:03.20]Did you press the button a little hard?
[64:04.46]I pressed it a little too hard.
[64:05.42]Don't worry about it.
[64:06.24]Don't worry about it.
[64:06.80]We're going to get our speed back here and make sure we're back on track.
[64:13.22]Ladies and gentlemen, we do apologize for the turbulence there.
[64:17.60]There was a choo-choo train sound.
[64:19.12]We had to avoid the choo-choo train sound.
[64:22.05]Things are getting completely back to normal here.
[64:25.29]A little bit of light turbulence that you may have just had.
[64:42.29]Jerma!
[64:42.53]A little bit of light turkey, that's what it is, yeah.
[64:45.48]It should get us cleared up here, and a lot of tents will come approved with a great thing.
[64:50.48]Thank you for flying off tonight.
[64:54.90]God, that was terrifying, Jerma.
[64:56.30]I'm going to be honest with you.
[64:58.29]What happened to my phone?
[65:00.77]I'm constantly losing it over here.
[65:02.39]Hey, we need to go left.
[65:03.73]Yeah, we're going.
[65:04.29]Don't worry.
[65:04.61]Alright.
[65:06.31]Don't worry.
[65:06.65]Chad, how are you doing back there?
[65:10.49]Doing good.
[65:11.10]Good?
[65:13.29]Alright.
[65:13.71]That was probably one of the more terrifying things that's happened to me.
[65:17.86]Honestly.
[65:18.92]It was one of the more... I didn't realize that you can't just do that.
[65:22.62]You know what I mean?
[65:23.50]You can't just do that.
[65:24.22]You can't just do that.
[65:25.18]You can't just do that.
[65:26.24]That's right.
[65:26.62]Going as fast as we're going, you can't just do that.
[65:30.48]You know?
[65:32.18]Like, it's just not safe to do that.
[65:33.82]It's very unsafe.
[65:34.85]Very unsafe.
[65:36.11]So... Why don't we go a little faster?
[65:37.95]Okay.
[65:40.09]Did you just move the...
[65:42.20]yeah careful careful I am gripping I don't like it I I'm kind of starting to think that you're the one that did that I did I I mean was autopilot on okay Jeremy you yeah you can't so we keep turning off course because we keep the plane when you move the yoke yeah
[66:02.26]It'll turn us off course.
[66:04.24]Oh.
[66:04.54]So every time you move the yoke, you'll override the lateral navigation on the autopilot.
[66:08.86]I feel like a really, really, really old person that does not trust the technology.
[66:13.44]Right?
[66:14.12]Like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[66:15.50]Oh, it's navigating?
[66:16.78]I don't know.
[66:17.62]I don't think it is.
[66:19.06]I don't know.
[66:19.76]I'm going to have to keep my hands on this.
[66:22.13]Now, you're doing great, Jerma.
[66:23.93]I need to find my phone.
[66:25.49]Did it go underneath the whole thing?
[66:28.99]Oh, I got it.
[66:30.47]Yeah, you got it.
[66:31.19]I got it.
[66:33.70]Oh, no.
[66:35.22]Grandpa, it's designed to be that way.
[66:37.44]Yeah, yeah, of course.
[66:39.34]Yeah, you know what it's designed?
[66:41.28]This is designed really well up here, too.
[66:42.98]Yeah, yeah.
[66:44.30]Alright, you know what?
[66:46.00]Let me call air traffic control real quick to get us cleared to a, I'd say, two and a half speed.
[66:51.91]Okay.
[66:53.67]Los Angeles Center, Austin Show 101 looking for a 2.5X.
[67:03.20]Oh, maximum velocity, great, wonderful.
[67:05.68]Roger.
[67:05.90]Okay, we're already set.
[67:07.48]We're going fast?
[67:08.28]We're going as fast as we possibly can.
[67:09.94]In fact, but I could do this.
[67:12.82]Check it out.
[67:14.62]You're going overdrive?
[67:16.18]I could go overdrive.
[67:17.46]Oh, no.
[67:18.18]Actually, let me set it over here.
[67:22.23]Let me go .80.
[67:28.82]Go to the developer console.
[67:29.98]Look at that.
[67:30.34]See, watch the throttle move on its own.
[67:31.78]I'm not even touching it.
[67:32.90]Can you believe that?
[67:33.53]You used, like, cheats to do this.
[67:35.47]Yeah.
[67:36.35]This is a cheat code.
[67:37.15]Yeah.
[67:37.95]Absolutely.
[67:40.35]So, how fast are we going?
[67:41.87]So, Jerma, we are going a lot very fast.
[67:46.10]Faster than a car.
[67:47.14]Jerma, I need to go over some stuff with you.
[67:48.84]Sure.
[67:49.94]Where are those charts?
[67:52.82]Jerma, you had one job, and that's the charge.
[67:55.18]Okay, Jerma.
[67:55.62]What do you need?
[67:55.98]So what's gonna happen?
[67:56.90]Okay, you got it.
[67:57.58]We're gonna be flying into San Francisco, California.
[67:59.92]Is that the right one?
[68:01.38]Uh, that's not it.
[68:02.38]I need the other one.
[68:03.40]The other one?
[68:04.86]Is this light okay, Mauricio?
[68:06.64]Give it up for Mauricio, our camera guy.
[68:08.59]Woo!
[68:11.45]In chat, we'll get updates on donations and things like that.
[68:16.21]So, folks, that's San Francisco.
[68:19.23]So we're gonna... Oh, that's Las Vegas.
[68:24.86]That's San Francisco.
[68:27.09]So here's the deal.
[68:28.79]Show me.
[68:29.35]Teach me.
[68:29.95]We are going to be flying into San Francisco.
[68:32.27]We're going to be landing on that runway.
[68:34.73]Right?
[68:35.00]Runway 28 right.
[68:36.40]Coming in this way.
[68:37.26]Yeah, coming in this way.
[68:38.16]Right?
[68:39.88]Now, I did get a weather report in San Francisco.
[68:42.50]They told me that there are storms.
[68:44.69]There's storms?
[68:45.27]There's storms in San Francisco.
[68:46.79]So what do we do about that?
[68:49.27]We've got all the equipment aboard here to be able to handle the storm.
[68:52.31]Can you put the cheats in to make it so the storm doesn't happen?
[68:54.76]No, we can't do the cheats.
[68:56.18]The storm is definitely happening.
[68:57.52]Unfortunately, one thing you can't control is Mother Nature.
[69:00.96]But the beauty of Mother Nature is she gives us smooth air sometimes.
[69:04.62]So we turn off that super, right?
[69:07.91]How are we gonna get there?
[69:09.37]Here's our route into San Francisco, okay?
[69:12.55]We're gonna start at this intersection called Resume, or whatever the hell that is.
[69:17.83]Then we're gonna go to Diamond, then we're gonna go to Lane, then we're gonna go to Always, Hefley, R2, Adam,
[69:24.46]Every time I turn the seatbelt sign off, it seems like the turbulence gets worse.
[69:29.28]Should we just tell them, just everybody sit down?
[69:31.34]Yeah, yeah.
[69:32.12]Can you make that announcement?
[69:33.29]Make that announcement, please.
[69:37.65]I've lost the radio.
[69:38.65]There it is.
[69:41.39]Alright.
[69:42.15]Make that announcement for me, Jordan.
[69:45.33]Sit down.
[69:47.39]That's a good way to do it.
[69:48.30]That's a good way to do it.
[69:50.74]Alright.
[69:51.26]Well...
[69:53.44]There we go.
[69:53.76]It's like in and out.
[69:54.68]It's like in and out.
[69:56.61]Alright.
[70:01.09]So let's get back to this here.
[70:02.55]Yeah, yeah.
[70:03.07]We need more of this.
[70:03.85]So we're going to go to Diamond, OK?
[70:05.95]And we're going to Lane, Always, Heathley, R2, Adam, Cougar.
[70:11.20]OK.
[70:11.54]Alright.
[70:14.54]Berks.
[70:15.52]That's going to take us straight into the runway 2A run.
[70:17.82]So what are all of those spots?
[70:20.14]They're like little intersections.
[70:22.57]Like little intersections.
[70:23.51]And at these intersections, we have to cross them at certain altitudes.
[70:26.71]So we have to go across these at that certain... And by the way, altitude, if you don't know, is the height of the... The elevation.
[70:31.68]Right now, we are at 30,000 feet.
[70:33.30]So if you can see right here, we're at 30,000 feet.
[70:36.28]Marisa, if you can show them right here.
[70:38.32]We're at 30,000 feet.
[70:40.06]We're cruising at a speed of Mach .795, which is 302 knots.
[70:42.90]As you get higher in the air, the air gets thinner.
[70:49.06]So it's a little bit easier.
[70:51.72]So that's why you see pilots, planes fly so high.
[70:55.45]It's more efficient.
[70:56.41]The air is thinner.
[70:57.51]You can go faster.
[70:58.51]A lot of things work better, except you can't breathe, which would stink.
[71:02.89]That would be bad.
[71:03.61]That would suck if they weren't pressurized.
[71:05.41]Yeah, and altitude is the height of the plane.
[71:07.63]That's where all the eight-year-olds are.
[71:08.89]So we are coming up here on our top of descent.
[71:12.49]See that green thing right there?
[71:14.03]That's our top of descent.
[71:15.01]So we're going to be.
[71:15.55]Wait, we're about to descend?
[71:16.47]We're going to descend here very shortly.
[71:18.67]Now, this is what I want to do.
[71:20.63]We're going to, because of the bad weather, we're going to be on an instrument landing.
[71:23.63]Okay.
[71:24.09]Alright.
[71:25.30]So the instrument landing is right here.
[71:29.76]I keep turning the lights on.
[71:32.52]So the instrument landing is right here.
[71:37.94]No, Jerma, don't touch those.
[71:39.08]Don't touch those, big time.
[71:40.82]Alright.
[71:42.52]Instrument landing right here.
[71:46.32]So the plane is going to fly itself.
[71:47.84]So we need a 111.7.
[71:49.56]I'm sorry.
[71:51.00]I'm surrounded by like ADHD toys.
[71:52.80]You know what I mean?
[71:54.10]It's like old buttons and switches.
[71:55.75]You don't have one of those?
[71:56.53]You use one of those things?
[71:57.33]Yeah.
[71:57.79]That's so funny.
[71:58.71]Yeah.
[71:59.47]That's why you should be an airline pilot.
[72:01.49]Because it would just keep you distracted the entire time.
[72:05.19]Okay.
[72:05.59]So 111.7 and 284.
[72:06.21]Alright.
[72:06.81]Alright.
[72:10.63]Hit that 284.
[72:11.85]So that's the course, right?
[72:12.97]So that's the, that's the, what they call the...
[72:16.86]The course of the runway, that's like the direction of the runway.
[72:20.28]So this frequency right here is the frequency of the localizer.
[72:24.48]The localizer is what lines the plane up straight with the runway.
[72:28.18]There's two parts to a full ILS approach.
[72:30.52]There's the localizer and then there's the glide slope.
[72:33.16]The localizer is what lines you up with the runway.
[72:35.41]The glide slope is what tells the plane at what altitude and what distance to be as they're approaching the runway.
[72:42.45]You could have just told me those were Destiny 2 weapons and I wouldn't believe you.
[72:48.07]Really?
[72:48.25]What was it called again?
[72:49.11]Did you know that every 737 is equipped with nuclear weapons?
[72:53.19]What?
[72:54.47]Yeah, it's that button right there.
[72:55.91]See these buttons right here?
[72:57.74]Nuclear weapons.
[72:59.82]That's right.
[73:00.20]Do you believe me, Chad?
[73:02.50]By the way, Chad, we have raised $7,000 for Minority Pilot Advanced Foundation.
[73:10.01]Yep.
[73:10.73]Thank you so much for contributing.
[73:13.08]I do appreciate it.
[73:14.10]Wow, the clouds are real cloudy here.
[73:15.64]It did just get cloudy.
[73:16.58]It did just get very cloudy.
[73:18.12]So we're getting up to our top of descent here.
[73:20.08]Pretty smooth flight so far, right?
[73:21.78]Yeah.
[73:22.04]Other than a couple of incidents.
[73:23.68]Yeah, that's to be expected, though.
[73:25.06]Yeah, absolutely.
[73:26.07]Right?
[73:27.79]Okay.
[73:29.20]Couple things so as we as we're gonna we're gonna do a nice steady descent here And we're gonna let the plane start to descend when we hit our top of descent So this is very interesting to me because I did not know how this out has worked You are changing the altitude of the plane with that knob
[73:46.61]Yes, and also this knob.
[73:48.13]You can control.
[73:48.79]I always thought it was like, okay, we're going down now, right?
[73:52.17]You can do both.
[73:52.89]You can do both.
[73:53.63]Right?
[73:54.15]This knob, this is the command that you're given to the altitude that you'd like on the autopilot, right?
[74:02.17]Yeah.
[74:04.05]And then if you hit, this is vertical navigation, so the plane is actually controlling.
[74:09.36]So you can put whatever number you want here and it will, as it changes.
[74:13.28]If you want it instantly, use vertical speed.
[74:16.10]If you want the, because VNAV is on, it's doing what the computer tells it to do.
[74:21.51]I see, alright.
[74:22.05]So right now, it's, do you see where it says T slash D?
[74:25.81]Yep.
[74:27.49]That means that's when our descent's going to start.
[74:29.93]So you'll see when we hit T slash D that the aircraft will start descending on its own.
[74:34.28]Okay.
[74:34.64]And it'll go to the commands of the computer.
[74:38.66]So we're about to make the announcement about the descent, right?
[74:40.72]Yeah.
[74:41.08]So go ahead and make the announcement.
[74:42.18]I'll make that announcement.
[74:49.07]Oh, it has started.
[74:51.89]It's starting to descend?
[74:52.67]Yep.
[74:52.77]Am I going to make that announcement?
[74:54.15]Yeah.
[74:54.51]I'm going to leave this up.
[74:55.79]Okay.
[74:59.44]Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our initial descent into San Francisco.
[75:03.40]Please, all of you, take out your phones and aim them out the window for your fucking vlog that you're going to make on this trip.
[75:11.60]Make sure you aim it directly out the window and keep it there until the plane lands so you can time lapse that part in your video.
[75:19.07]Thank you so much for flying.
[75:20.13]I'll give you an update on our final descent, but we'll be arriving shortly.
[75:24.55]Thank you.
[75:25.91]Oh, drag required, so we need to pull this out a little bit.
[75:28.65]Whoa.
[75:32.68]So we're descending.
[75:33.36]You see this right here?
[75:36.70]We are descending.
[75:37.38]Yeah.
[75:38.22]Yeah, we're descending.
[75:42.42]In ATC, we can get back to our normal speed there.
[75:45.67]Alright.
[75:48.25]Alright.
[75:48.91]Alright.
[75:49.41]Okay.
[75:51.53]One thing I'm thankful for, Jerma, is just a smooth flight and a safe flight.
[75:56.43]Oh!
[75:57.33]Oh, my God, Jerma!
[76:00.51]That's a cabin, that's a cabin depressurization.
[76:02.97]A cabin depressurization?
[76:04.85]Yes, you need to put on your oxygen mask.
[76:07.34]Uh, Jerma, press G. That comes from here.
[76:08.74]No, it doesn't.
[76:09.48]What?
[76:09.90]Hold on, no, uh, Jerma, no, no, it's, no, it's not here, you're, you're a pilot.
[76:13.86]I've only been a passenger.
[76:14.82]Look to your right, look to your right.
[76:16.76]Right, you see that?
[76:17.48]That's your oxygen mask.
[76:18.46]This?
[76:18.86]Yes.
[76:19.38]Pull it out.
[76:21.06]Alright.
[76:21.34]That looks like the Bane mask?
[76:22.50]Yes, put it on, Jerma.
[76:25.36]Put it on.
[76:27.81]Okay, put it on.
[76:28.65]Please just do you, do yours for assisting others.
[76:32.97]How does this go on?
[76:33.87]Just do it.
[76:34.63]We didn't have a flight attendant come up and tell us.
[76:36.85]Why didn't we pay attention all those times?
[76:38.73]Dad, thank you.
[76:39.35]Here you go.
[76:42.61]You got to get it all in.
[76:44.26]Dad?
[76:44.40]Dad?
[76:48.24]Can you hear me?
[76:50.46]Dad?
[76:50.74]I hope you're okay.
[76:54.24]I wish you all the best.
[76:57.63]I was born in the boxers.
[76:58.93]Alright, John.
[76:59.77]We need to get the safe habitat.
[77:03.13]Safe habitat?
[77:04.05]Well, we need to do it really quickly.
[77:05.83]How quickly?
[77:07.05]Alright, so hold on.
[77:10.18]Hurry up.
[77:11.70]That's a little too quickly.
[77:14.30]Oh, did this come out?
[77:16.00]Ah, a cow!
[77:17.48]Ah, a cow!
[77:23.85]A cow from the children's toys.
[77:28.06]Alright, we're gonna, we're gonna set pretty rapidly here.
[77:36.60]Alright, hold on, girl.
[77:38.06]Don't worry, when we get to 10,000 feet, it's gonna be safe.
[77:43.83]I'm not even talking to you, dude.
[77:45.33]I'm not talking to you.
[77:47.23]Don't worry, girl.
[77:49.31]We're going over to 10,000 feet.
[77:52.25]Don't worry.
[77:52.87]It's like I'm playing Modern Skyrim, man.
[77:58.44]Alright.
[77:59.62]Alright.
[78:05.04]Alright.
[78:05.76]Alright.
[78:24.19]Are you doing it?
[78:26.19]Yeah, we're doing it.
[78:27.03]We're going to increase our descent a little bit more.
[78:33.36]Okay.
[78:36.66]Okay.
[78:38.54]Okay.
[78:39.50]Okay.
[78:43.64]I'm really glad that my roommate is talking to me through the wall in the apartment that we have.
[78:51.81]What are you talking about?
[78:54.81]I can't hear anything.
[78:55.63]We're getting there, Joe, but there's deeper shit to get in.
[79:14.21]Can you hear me?
[79:14.91]Oh, I know, we're going that way.
[79:19.07]We're going that way.
[79:20.53]That way.
[79:21.86]Oh, don't look at your phone!
[79:22.88]Put your phone down!
[79:24.88]Your phone!
[79:26.92]Okay, look.
[79:28.68]How much money have you raised to minority pilot advancement program?
[79:31.14]Okay.
[79:31.86]We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going.
[79:40.55]Okay, we're about to get down there.
[79:46.19]I don't know where this is going.
[80:09.02]Alright, here we go.
[80:10.68]We're going to start pulling up, okay?
[80:17.64]10-2, 10-2.
[80:17.86]10-2, 10-2.
[80:18.10]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:18.52]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:18.80]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:20.44]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:21.02]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:21.64]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:24.35]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:26.31]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:28.53]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:28.91]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:30.83]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:32.13]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:32.57]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:33.03]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:33.53]10-2, 10-2, 10-2.
[80:35.47]10-2, 10-2, 10-2
[80:39.48]Alright, just set that off to the right there.
[80:41.00]Wow!
[80:43.02]Oh my God.
[80:43.49]I heard every single word you said.
[80:45.47]Did you?
[80:45.99]Yeah, it was very clear.
[80:47.11]Alright.
[80:48.65]Oh my God, that was very dangerous.
[80:50.99]Let me tell you what happened.
[80:52.14]What just happened?
[80:56.72]Whoa.
[81:03.91]Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
[81:06.67]What you just experienced is a rapid depressurization.
[81:10.69]Everything is okay.
[81:11.57]We've descended to a safe altitude of 10,000 feet, where we will be experiencing breathable air.
[81:18.32]We will be landing at San Francisco, which is your original destination, and we'll be able to get you down there safely.
[81:26.28]Flight attendants, please be seated for the remainder of the flight, as we're anticipating the rest of the flight to be quite bumpy.
[81:33.20]Quite bumpy?
[81:33.92]Yeah.
[81:36.70]Sometimes I like to turn off the seatbelt sign and turn it on again.
[81:40.02]Do it again.
[81:40.72]Alright.
[81:42.12]That was an experience.
[81:44.22]That was a huge experience.
[81:45.74]Alright, Jerma.
[81:46.56]The rest of this flight is going to be quite bumpy.
[81:48.74]Okay.
[81:49.16]So I need you to stay strapped in.
[81:50.80]I am.
[81:51.64]We're going to be on an ILS approach to runway 28 right.
[81:57.61]And we're going to probably, we're already down, I mean at this point in the arrival, usually we're like a little bit higher, okay?
[82:04.15]But since we had a cabin rapid depressurization, we're at 10,000 feet, okay?
[82:09.07]Because we can breathe down here.
[82:10.75]We can't get any higher than this because any higher than this we can't breathe.
[82:13.79]Okay, so that's a very interesting educational point.
[82:17.03]Right.
[82:18.63]So I always wondered, why do the oxygen masks come down?
[82:23.73]And that's because you can't breathe the air up.
[82:26.32]If there's a deep pressure, there's no oxygen.
[82:30.38]There is oxygen here, though.
[82:32.20]We are at 10,000 feet, and currently the aircraft is pressurized with the outside air.
[82:40.18]The cockpit is pressurized to the altitude at which you're, you know, it's pressurized lower so you can breathe, right?
[82:47.56]So that's why you can breathe in a plane.
[82:49.04]Right.
[82:49.56]But in that particular situation, we lost the cabin depressurized.
[82:54.65]So we have to get to a point where we can breathe the outside air.
[82:57.59]See, I actually, that's new.
[82:59.37]I never really knew the mechanics behind that.
[83:02.23]That's very interesting.
[83:03.35]Yep.
[83:03.57]Very interesting.
[83:04.05]Yep.
[83:04.49]Alright.
[83:06.91]So things are going to get real intense.
[83:08.97]Alright.
[83:09.91]So we'll get our landing lights on here.
[83:11.97]Okay.
[83:14.67]And let's do auto brake two.
[83:17.00]And Jerm, I hope you're paying attention because the next flight you're going to be flying.
[83:21.98]I'm not even going to touch it.
[83:23.28]Nice.
[83:24.60]That is if we land safely.
[83:27.42]We better.
[83:28.08]We better.
[83:31.14]If we land safely... I think I have a basic idea of how to do that.
[83:35.24]You think so?
[83:36.22]I think so.
[83:36.66]Okay.
[83:37.28]Alright.
[83:38.10]You're going to watch me, and then you're going to have to essentially... Interpret what you're doing.
[83:43.08]Exactly.
[83:47.98]So this is... That circle here, that's where we are landing, right?
[83:51.47]No, that's not.
[83:52.47]That's if we go around.
[83:54.29]Oh.
[83:55.15]Yeah.
[83:56.95]Air traffic control, Huffman...
[84:00.50]NorCal approach, what's the altimeter in San Francisco?
[84:03.24]Austin Air 101, current altimeter 299.2 299.2, okay, we're already settled there.
[84:13.56]Good, good.
[84:14.32]Here we go.
[84:15.50]You know, it's not as bumpy as I thought it was going to be.
[84:18.74]Sometimes that happens.
[84:20.79]Sometimes that happens where you don't get the turbulence.
[84:25.19]You ever been on a plane when the turbulence is so bad that... I've never puked on an airplane, ever.
[84:31.71]But I've come close because of extraordinary turbulence I had one time.
[84:37.97]Kind of like we're starting to experience right now.
[84:42.39]This is lighter.
[84:42.95]Is there a puke bag up here?
[84:44.19]No, I think you're good.
[84:46.41]No, I'll be fine.
[84:46.91]You can handle it.
[84:48.53]I'll be fine.
[84:49.51]You can handle it.
[84:53.26]oh keep her straight there but this is nothing right so for those of you that are afraid of flying this is nothing this sort of turbulence is is the aircraft can handle even if it gets really violent it's pretty normal it's very normal and easy to look like if as you can tell look here look at the speed yeah look how it's how steady it's it stayed uh well
[85:19.86]I mean, give or take, it's pretty steady, right?
[85:25.55]And then, you know, look at the altitude.
[85:26.87]It's able to hold, right?
[85:28.23]It's very safe, okay?
[85:30.53]Alright, so let's get down to 8,000 feet, Trevor.
[85:32.51]We're gonna start, or just sit down here.
[85:33.99]See how it wants us to cross this intersection at 8,000 feet?
[85:36.07]Something a lot of people don't realize is just what an airplane is capable of taking and handling.
[85:42.77]When they do testing on these things, they test them well beyond even any limit that would ever exist.
[85:49.48]Right, yeah, absolutely.
[85:50.96]This could survive a nuclear attack.
[85:55.29]It is getting a little dicey.
[86:00.73]Alright.
[86:03.77]I actually used to be afraid of flying.
[86:05.71]Did you?
[86:05.91]A long time ago.
[86:06.71]Really?
[86:07.07]But now, not anymore?
[86:08.43]No.
[86:08.65]I mean, I'm flying a plane with you?
[86:10.87]What was that?
[86:17.28]What does that sound like?
[86:18.88]Oh, that's thunder.
[86:20.54]That's rain.
[86:21.06]Is that lightning?
[86:22.36]Oh, my god.
[86:22.70]That's actual lightning.
[86:23.92]That is real lightning.
[86:26.18]So what are we doing with the event of the lightning storm?
[86:29.94]Well, oh my God, honestly, my training doesn't really account for this.
[86:33.72]You've never flown in a thunderstorm?
[86:35.22]No.
[86:36.10]This is actually my first time.
[86:37.94]Oh.
[86:38.16]It's a little, yeah, but Jerma.
[86:41.54]What's the protocol?
[86:46.56]Just hold on.
[86:47.64]Just let the autopilot do its thing.
[86:50.77]We need to slow down just a little bit.
[86:54.43]And we need to make sure that we're...
[86:59.44]We need to slow down because we're going a little too fast.
[87:01.60]We're going too off?
[87:02.06]Coming in too off?
[87:02.82]We're coming in a little too off.
[87:04.26]So I'm going to pull this.
[87:04.94]This is a speed brake.
[87:05.70]We're going to slow down just a little bit.
[87:06.78]Slow it down.
[87:10.68]Yeah.
[87:10.82]Oh, God.
[87:11.38]Don't worry, Trevor.
[87:12.02]We got it under control.
[87:14.86]I will tell you, if it's any consolation, you're a little better of a pilot than Hassan Paikin.
[87:20.72]Go.
[87:21.29]I'll take it.
[87:21.81]The first part of a great pilot is his ability to stay calm under pressure.
[87:26.63]And Jerma, from the moment you got into this cockpit, you've been nothing but calm.
[87:32.11]A little bit of lightning?
[87:33.41]A little bit of lightning, no problem.
[87:34.95]Not a big deal.
[87:35.51]You've seen it before.
[87:37.15]It's not a big deal.
[87:38.37]Not a big deal at all.
[87:40.21]Notice how it gets a little bumpier as we start fighting through those clouds, as we descend through those clouds here.
[87:45.66]Alright, Jerma, I'm going to need you to eventually, I'm going to need you to do the flaps.
[87:54.18]Not yet.
[87:54.90]Not yet.
[87:55.44]Not yet.
[87:58.28]So we're on an instrument landing approach chat, so the computer's going to help us fly this plane in.
[88:02.96]Staying calm and collected throughout the entire series.
[88:11.72]You're not even going to sweat, Jerma.
[88:13.52]This is what your training has prepared you for.
[88:16.48]I don't know why we went off... Oh, Jerma, remember how the... Don't turn it.
[88:20.82]Take your hands off for a second.
[88:24.34]Oh, it's the instrument guy.
[88:25.82]Yep, yep.
[88:27.38]You know, look, you're a mature guy.
[88:31.30]You don't trust computers.
[88:33.06]That's right.
[88:34.54]You could do that the whole way.
[88:35.90]Did Hassan scream?
[88:37.40]He did scream.
[88:38.24]Yeah.
[88:38.46]We're going to GERD.
[88:39.92]We're a little too fast to slow down.
[89:01.04]Don't scream.
[89:01.56]Don't scream.
[89:03.44]Don't scream, Jerma.
[89:04.22]We've got to slow down, though.
[89:05.02]We're having a hard time.
[89:11.99]We're having a little bit of a hard time here slowing down.
[89:14.03]Oh, now the speed's coming down.
[89:16.25]Austin Air, clear.
[89:18.45]We're going to a right.
[89:21.09]Wind's calm.
[89:23.31]Some wind shear has been reported in the area.
[89:27.64]Oh boy.
[89:27.94]Roger, cleared runway 28R, Austin Air 101.
[89:32.12]Wind shear is when wind comes and pushes your plane to the ground very violently.
[89:36.39]Okay, right.
[89:37.75]Austin Air frequency for 28R is 111.7. 111.7.
[89:47.88]Oh, yeah, we got it.
[89:48.42]We got it.
[89:48.90]We got it here.
[89:50.62]Yep.
[89:50.82]And, uh, SoCal, uh, or NorCal, excuse me, NorCal, uh, approach, we are going to need, uh, fire trucks and emergency services on the ground.
[90:00.67]We lost a flight attendant.
[90:02.63]I didn't want to tell you, but we lost a flight attendant when you, uh, when I did my little action.
[90:09.05]Oh, yeah, she died.
[90:10.23]What?
[90:10.49]Unfortunately, yeah.
[90:11.93]Brute force trauma to the head.
[90:14.19]It was very violent.
[90:15.17]She hit her head on one of the snack baskets.
[90:17.88]when I did that little maneuver.
[90:21.02]But we decided to keep it.
[90:23.26]She didn't make it.
[90:32.28]Oh my goodness.
[90:32.95]Oh, we're going to move this.
[90:34.89]What is it, 11.17?
[90:35.55]Yep.
[90:38.43]Alright.
[90:39.99]OK.
[90:40.49]Jerma, we need to start configuring, because we're a little bit.
[90:43.39]Where do I go?
[90:43.71]Where do I go?
[90:44.21]Flaps.
[90:44.57]Give me flaps five.
[90:49.94]Flap 5, check.
[90:51.00]Okay, give me flaps 10.
[90:52.06]Flaps 10?
[90:52.64]No, not yet.
[90:53.26]Oh.
[91:02.29]I don't like that voice.
[91:05.29]That was a concern.
[91:06.51]Hold on.
[91:07.45]We're going to be landing.
[91:09.19]Flaps 30, 140.
[91:09.85]Alright, give me flaps 10, please.
[91:13.89]Flaps 10, check.
[91:14.93]Alright.
[91:15.29]That was not a, uh.
[91:16.56]That was a, uh.
[91:17.32]Alright.
[91:18.96]Uh.
[91:20.10]Flaps 15.
[91:20.52]There's another one.
[91:25.46]Don't worry.
[91:26.52]That's to the ground.
[91:27.17]That's where we're going next.
[91:28.77]Flaps 15, Jerma.
[91:30.95]Gear down.
[91:32.41]Flaps 15.
[91:33.43]Check.
[91:33.81]Gear down.
[91:34.41]Gear down.
[91:35.07]What is that?
[91:35.61]This?
[91:35.97]Pull it.
[91:36.55]Push it down.
[91:37.35]Pull and then down?
[91:38.06]Yep.
[91:39.60]Landing gear.
[91:40.16]Heading down.
[91:41.30]Okay.
[91:41.66]Here we go.
[91:42.38]Give me flaps 30, Jerma.
[91:43.30]Flaps 30.
[91:43.72]You got it, Captain.
[91:45.18]Thank you.
[91:48.04]Okay, hold on.
[91:48.58]Well, holy, holy shit.
[91:51.50]Oh my God.
[91:52.08]Don't worry, Jerma.
[91:52.70]We got it under control.
[91:53.54]Where's the runway?
[91:54.70]It's out there somewhere, but the plane is going to help us out.
[91:58.06]We're on a full ILS approach, Jerma.
[92:00.02]Okay.
[92:00.72]A little lightning.
[92:01.74]Don't worry about it.
[92:03.40]Hey, I'm not going to scream, though.
[92:04.82]Oh, but I'm going to voice crack and feel bad.
[92:07.06]And careful, don't touch the yoke, okay?
[92:09.22]I mean, you can put your hands on it, just don't move it.
[92:11.19]Alright.
[92:11.85]We're just going to arm the speed brake there.
[92:14.39]We're going to get to our final approach, which is... Alright.
[92:17.91]There we go.
[92:18.47]We've hit the glide slope.
[92:20.05]Excuse me.
[92:20.57]Can't see it.
[92:26.74]There we go.
[92:30.85]We're going to be able to see it at the last minute, okay?
[92:35.81]2,500.
[92:36.41]That's 2,500 feet above the ground.
[92:37.85]We're 2,500 feet above the water right now.
[92:39.63]Alright, landing checklist.
[92:41.58]Speed brake arm.
[92:43.14]Speed brake arm.
[92:44.44]Flaps.
[92:46.46]Flaps at 30.
[92:47.32]30.
[92:47.60]Landing gear.
[92:48.22]Landing gear down.
[92:48.90]Three green.
[92:50.44]All that other shit.
[92:52.60]Landing checklist.
[92:53.26]All that other shit.
[92:53.83]Landing checklist complete.
[92:54.95]Complete.
[92:55.93]Okay.
[92:57.30]Jerma, as soon as I see the runway, I'm going to take control.
[92:59.92]Okay.
[93:00.06]Then we're going to land.
[93:00.88]It's going to come right through the clouds right here.
[93:02.68]Okay.
[93:02.82]I'm pretty confident.
[93:04.96]Alright.
[93:06.00]Okay.
[93:09.94]Make it through the storm.
[93:11.10]Yeah.
[93:12.18]Very.
[93:13.04]We're starting to peek through the clouds here.
[93:14.38]You see?
[93:14.72]I can see.
[93:15.14]There it is.
[93:15.68]Alright.
[93:17.32]I see.
[93:17.80]Yep.
[93:19.26]Alright.
[93:20.14]I see land.
[93:21.18]Yep.
[93:21.44]Land is over here.
[93:23.75]We're a little too fast, though.
[93:28.14]There's the runway right here.
[93:29.08]You see it poking through the clouds here?
[93:30.64]Yep.
[93:32.28]I'm going to take control once we... You see the lead lights, the lights that are leading us in?
[93:37.88]So that's the, like, come land the plane here.
[93:40.86]Yep.
[93:41.32]That's it.
[93:41.68]That's like, come hither.
[93:44.30]Alright.
[93:48.94]You see it, Chad?
[93:51.90]How's Chad doing?
[93:52.96]Chad's good.
[93:53.86]Doing good?
[93:54.48]Oh, there it is.
[93:55.00]Okay.
[93:55.28]There we go.
[93:55.86]Oh, my God.
[93:56.38]Just like clear as day.
[93:57.38]Alright.
[94:03.20]We good?
[94:03.70]We're good.
[94:06.79]Don't worry.
[94:10.29]There's the runway right there, straight in front of us.
[94:14.55]So you see this, you see that pink line?
[94:17.81]I do.
[94:18.59]That's what we want to try to stay on.
[94:19.98]You want to keep the crossing.
[94:21.56]1,000 feet.
[94:26.83]It's going to stay right in the middle.
[94:28.33]Oh boy, it's right in the middle.
[94:29.65]Yep, right in the middle.
[94:31.75]Oh, this thing is moving.
[94:33.23]Yeah, it's me.
[94:34.07]I'm moving it.
[94:35.13]It's not Autoland anymore.
[94:36.35]It's me.
[94:40.35]That lightning's still there, isn't it?
[94:42.19]It's above us, thankfully.
[94:43.49]Yeah, we're a little too fast.
[94:52.89]I like lightning, though.
[94:54.77]It's a cool piece of nature.
[94:56.15]I don't like it when it's near me.
[94:58.31]I mean, it's nice to see in the cockpit, you know what I mean?
[95:01.73]If you don't mind, I've got a blog to make.
[95:03.93]Oh, do you?
[95:04.21]Alright, we're about to touch down here, I think.
[95:22.14]We're a little low.
[95:30.90]Okay, Jerma.
[95:32.26]Look forward, we're about to land.
[95:36.57]Yeah, I got it.
[95:39.75]50.
[95:40.73]40.
[95:40.91]30.
[95:42.23]20.
[95:42.25]10.
[95:43.95]Are you kidding me?
[95:45.83]Are you kidding me?
[95:46.71]Are you kidding me?
[95:48.77]Are you kidding me?
[95:49.71]That was unbelievably smooth.
[95:51.55]Are you kidding me?
[95:52.29]That deserves applause.
[95:53.51]That's a clap landing right there.
[95:54.82]That is a clap landing.
[95:56.00]Are you kidding me?
[95:56.62]That was unbelievable.
[95:58.34]Are you kidding?
[96:00.16]That was a perfect landing.
[96:01.94]That was textbook.
[96:03.06]Oh.
[96:03.90]We need a break.
[96:05.06]We need a break to play.
[96:06.84]I think we blew a tire.
[96:08.26]What the hell was that?
[96:09.32]Why are we blowing tires?
[96:11.00]What the hell was that?
[96:14.32]Did we blow a tire?
[96:16.18]I don't know.
[96:16.98]Austin, that was actually impressive.
[96:19.29]Was that a good one?
[96:20.03]I don't know what the hell that was.
[96:21.71]Did we blow a tire?
[96:22.83]Did we celebrate a little too early?
[96:24.31]Oh, my God.
[96:27.07]It's terrifying.
[96:28.87]Good Lord.
[96:29.51]Was that a good landing?
[96:32.70]That was actually really good.
[96:34.52]Oh, you should be actually proud of that.
[96:37.04]Okay, well, we landed here.
[96:43.02]Alright, put those flaps all the way up to, very slowly, up to zero.
[96:48.85]Zero?
[96:49.29]Yep.
[96:50.29]And ladies and gentlemen, welcome to San Francisco.
[96:53.21]Alright, now Jerma.
[96:57.39]Is that one?
[96:58.63]Jerma.
[96:59.53]How do I get it to zero?
[97:02.67]Jerma, I think it's time for your turn.
[97:06.52]My turn?
[97:07.42]I think it's time for you to fly this thing
[97:11.30]down to one of my favorite cities, Los Angeles, California.
[97:15.74]I'll go for it.
[97:18.00]It's like a horror movie.
[97:19.62]It's like a 1970s horror movie.
[97:22.20]You're going to say something scary.
[97:26.13]And you know what I heard?
[97:27.89]The weather in Los Angeles is even worse.
[97:31.05]There's a storm.
[97:33.25]Oh no.
[97:33.95]Yeah.
[97:35.39]And can I phone a friend at some point?
[97:38.55]You're gonna take off and you're gonna land.
[97:41.83]Okay?
[97:44.21]You're gonna take off and you're gonna land.
[97:45.77]Let me see if I can get the lightning right.
[97:46.81]Let me see if I can get the lightning.
[97:47.79]Okay.
[97:49.95]And that's when they found the bodies hidden underneath the floorboards of the house.
[97:59.87]I got it!
[98:01.99]It's close!
[98:04.08]Alright, first things first, before we get Jerma up in the air here, how much money have we raised for minority pilots so far?
[98:13.37]Are we close to 10 grand?
[98:17.19]Where are we at?
[98:20.50]Where are we at?
[98:23.27]$7,500 from Minority Pilot.
[98:26.25]We can get $10,000.
[98:30.13]For those of you who are just tuning in and wonder what Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation is, we're supporting this foundation.
[98:41.31]It helps
[98:43.83]pay for education, and start the careers of underrepresented minorities in the aviation industry.
[98:51.14]Because right now, there's a lot of underrepresentation.
[98:54.86]And this program helps bring folks, and we talked to Rod about it earlier, from the inner cities, provides them a pathway and a great education to be able to become a commercial airline pilot.
[99:07.77]So it's a great foundation.
[99:10.08]And it's a great thing to contribute to.
[99:12.88]I think we can hit $10,000 if we can.
[99:15.54]Donate today.
[99:16.28]You can donate via the Twitch extension.
[99:18.88]I think people are donating.
[99:19.80]Rap King Bob just donated $1.
[99:22.95]Octave donated $5.
[99:25.51]Right there.
[99:25.93]Keep it rolling.
[99:26.45]Amazing.
[99:27.25]Keep it rolling.
[99:28.17]In the meantime, Jerma, I'm going to get you programmed here.
[99:33.50]We're going to go to Los Angeles, okay?
[99:35.64]Can somebody help me find this telephone we're filming?
[99:38.33]I can't reach it.
[99:38.87]I think it's like directly under the center of the sea.
[99:41.83]Oh, is it?
[99:42.70]I think so.
[99:46.30]Alright.
[99:47.12]Wow, there's a lot of bad weather.
[99:49.00]I'm looking at the map right now.
[99:50.28]It's not good.
[99:51.50]It's not good?
[99:52.08]How long is the flight from here to there?
[99:53.58]It's faster.
[99:55.72]Even faster than what we did before, I think.
[99:59.16]Is it not there?
[99:59.76]Did my phone get lost?
[100:04.76]For a second, I thought that was your phone shining a light down.
[100:08.33]Okay.
[100:09.09]Thank you so much.
[100:09.59]I appreciate that.
[100:10.11]I'm just going to do real quick.
[100:12.59]I'm going to put in the route.
[100:13.57]I'm not going to do too much.
[100:19.87]Hey, guys, the intersection on this departure is sussy.
[100:24.21]Oh, you know what I got to do?
[100:24.89]It was one zero left.
[100:25.85]Okay, that works.
[100:27.73]So what was our flight time right there?
[100:29.90]That was about an hour, wasn't it, Chad?
[100:31.72]How long was that flight?
[100:33.61]So we're in some change.
[100:34.95]Yep.
[100:37.63]I'm just programming the route right here.
[100:40.94]Okay.
[100:42.44]Virgil.
[100:43.00]Virgil.
[100:45.64]Okay.
[100:47.58]Virgil.
[100:48.10]Virgil.
[100:49.54]And, uh, Iron Man too.
[100:51.04]Okay.
[100:52.80]It's just cool names.
[100:53.80]Yeah.
[100:54.10]Iron Man too.
[100:55.02]Yep.
[100:55.34]That's the, that's into Los Angeles.
[100:56.88]That's the arrival.
[100:57.66]And we're going to be landing on a two, four left.
[101:01.19]Okay.
[101:01.99]Runway 2-4, or 2-4 right.
[101:05.12]Runway 2-4 right.
[101:05.98]That's your runway.
[101:06.84]It's going to be an ILS approach into 2-4 right, only this time the weather's going to be even worse.
[101:12.26]And I'm the one that's landing the plane in the worst weather?
[101:13.94]You are landing the plane, and you're taking off.
[101:15.90]And I'm taking off the plane?
[101:17.15]Yep, that's what's... Your training has prepared you for this moment.
[101:20.93]Honestly, I think I'll be okay.
[101:22.25]Chad, do you think he's going to be alright?
[101:23.53]What do you think?
[101:24.25]What do you think, Chad?
[101:25.07]Think I can do it?
[101:26.45]What do you think, guys?
[101:27.57]What do you guys think, huh?
[101:29.98]One's in the chat if you think I can take off the airplane.
[101:31.96]I think you'll be fine.
[101:35.26]Dispatch, south altitudes are positive or negative?
[101:41.53]Don't you know?
[101:43.81]I should know.
[101:44.29]Negative.
[101:44.67]Okay.
[101:45.59]Alright.
[101:46.79]He's like, you're the pilot.
[101:48.29]You're supposed to know that.
[101:50.07]We'll go to 29,000 feet.
[101:53.25]Alright.
[101:55.79]And then can we get our CG dispatch?
[102:02.19]Or not CG, or yeah, or CG.
[102:06.77]Your CG is 21.5.
[102:08.87]21.5, okay.
[102:09.72]Alright, Jeremy, you ready?
[102:13.62]Yeah, so when everyone's putting their bags in the overhead and everything.
[102:17.42]Give me flaps five.
[102:18.50]This is, so when people are putting their bags in the overhead and stuff here, this is what the pilot's doing up here.
[102:24.57]They're just like putting all this stuff in there.
[102:28.89]Oh, the parking brake.
[102:30.03]Excuse me.
[102:30.47]Oopsie daisy.
[102:33.01]Alright, so I'm taking off.
[102:36.83]Yep, you're going to be taking off here.
[102:38.11]We're going to go up to 29,000 feet.
[102:41.85]Let me get to the runway first.
[102:43.17]We've got to get to the right runway.
[102:47.24]And yeah, it's going to be easy, Jerm.
[102:48.76]I think you got this.
[102:49.92]I think I'll be alright at takeoff.
[102:51.00]Takeoff should be fine.
[102:51.90]I think it should be fine.
[102:53.52]I'm concerned about the landing.
[102:55.84]I think you'll be alright.
[102:57.70]Chad, what do you think?
[102:58.38]Press 1 in the chat if you think Jerma's going to be able to land the plane successfully.
[103:06.30]I don't think very many people have confidence in my ability.
[103:08.20]What about takeoff?
[103:08.86]I think you'll be fine on takeoff.
[103:10.24]You know what?
[103:11.56]I'm going to be good on both.
[103:13.32]I think you're going to land it.
[103:14.78]So Jerma, do you know what to do on takeoff?
[103:18.82]Oh, I was using the rudder.
[103:20.40]This push up, this pull back.
[103:23.36]What?
[103:24.39]This push up, this pull back.
[103:26.21]And you've got to keep your hand on it the entire time.
[103:28.07]Yeah, we go like that.
[103:28.91]Okay, yeah, exactly.
[103:31.09]Exactly right.
[103:34.41]You're going to be... I'm ready.
[103:35.87]You've got this.
[103:36.76]I'm getting into the internal zone.
[103:39.64]The only thing that could take you out is an engine failure.
[103:46.98]Great work.
[103:51.45]Why did you say that?
[103:52.65]No, honestly, I think it's going to be fine.
[103:54.57]This plane has been recently... The only thing they could take out is an engine failure.
[104:00.70]The lightning should have struck.
[104:01.88]We definitely want to go to Los Angeles.
[104:04.12]We definitely, yeah.
[104:05.16]I think the storm's cleared up, hasn't it?
[104:06.92]Or is it... You know, these poor passengers...
[104:12.43]These poor passengers just got on the ground and they're taking off again.
[104:16.81]We didn't even let them deplane.
[104:18.05]No, we didn't.
[104:18.59]We just said, you're going to LA with us.
[104:20.09]You're going to LA too.
[104:23.03]That's what we said.
[104:25.35]It's going to be okay.
[104:27.85]Let us off, they're saying.
[104:29.39]I see the chat and they say, let us off.
[104:31.57]You can hear them in the back.
[104:33.43]You know what I like to do?
[104:34.73]I like to just, in order to drown them out, I just turn up the volume of the plane.
[104:39.81]You hear back there?
[104:41.31]Just turn up the volume of the plane.
[104:43.27]See that?
[104:43.65]Hear that?
[104:45.13]That is the volume.
[104:47.35]That's the runway.
[104:48.23]Is that right there?
[104:49.19]Yep.
[104:53.81]This thing doesn't turn.
[104:56.12]It's not like a go-kart.
[104:57.90]It needs a lot of time.
[105:02.90]About the best driver in the world.
[105:04.00]I do apologize.
[105:06.10]That's...
[105:08.30]We're getting there.
[105:08.96]We're getting there.
[105:09.52]Don't worry about it.
[105:10.98]Okay, so you're just going to fly runway heading here, and then we're going to get you on course.
[105:18.57]Okay.
[105:19.09]Alright.
[105:19.69]Runway heading is 1-0-0, roughly.
[105:21.81]Or 0-0-0, rather.
[105:22.85]Sorry.
[105:23.75]3-5-0, or 1-0-0-0.
[105:25.34]Okay, I'm going to straighten out.
[105:28.00]Straighten this plane out for God's sake.
[105:30.18]And then you're going to actually...
[105:40.69]Okay.
[105:41.51]Make sure I'm not sweating anymore.
[105:43.33]Okay.
[105:43.93]Alright, Jerma.
[105:44.97]Okay.
[105:46.97]Straight on the runway.
[105:48.01]Okay.
[105:48.63]I'm going to keep the plane straight for you.
[105:51.80]When I say rotate.
[105:53.18]Rotate.
[105:53.74]Okay.
[105:54.36]You're going to pull the back, and you're going to follow the pink lines.
[105:57.72]I don't know if that's working.
[105:58.98]The pink lines you need here.
[106:01.54]Yeah, hold on.
[106:02.06]Pink lines up here.
[106:03.12]Where do you need pink lines?
[106:04.77]Pink lines here?
[106:06.97]Hold on.
[106:07.21]Just give me a second.
[106:14.87]I need to get that off.
[106:15.83]There's probably something.
[106:21.57]Okay.
[106:22.03]Alright.
[106:25.87]It's just go straight and then lift up and just keep it steady.
[106:31.03]Okay, that's not working.
[106:31.99]So... Is it discontinuity?
[106:39.94]Oh.
[106:42.42]Oh, here we go.
[106:48.09]Hold on.
[106:48.59]Make sure everything's... Yeah, I'm just making sure everything's good here.
[106:55.19]Everything's correct.
[106:56.27]Yeah, I think there's something that's missing in here.
[106:59.29]You're not doing anything on my side or just your side?
[107:01.19]Just my side.
[107:04.50]Okay.
[107:05.10]Okay.
[107:17.31]Ladies and gentlemen, this is your co-captain speaking.
[107:25.49]I just want to make sure everyone's interested in what's going on.
[107:28.55]I left my phone at the Los Angeles airport.
[107:31.84]We just figured it out that that's where it was.
[107:33.50]So I'm just going to go get it real quick.
[107:35.94]And we'll get you on your way.
[107:38.12]Dispatch, do we know why VNAV's not coming on?
[107:53.08]Great call.
[107:54.60]Great call.
[107:57.16]I don't think it does.
[107:59.46]It's a great call.
[108:01.20]Sometimes the plane forgets where it's at.
[108:03.64]Where are we?
[108:04.76]Do we need to reset them?
[108:07.56]Dispatch?
[108:11.41]KSFO to KLAS.
[108:12.51]I mean, it knows, right?
[108:14.79]Uh, but you're...
[108:17.99]Recycle these?
[108:18.83]Do we need to recycle?
[108:20.69]I didn't press any buttons.
[108:22.31]Okay, hold on guys.
[108:26.58]Chad, we need to do something real quick.
[108:31.44]Okay.
[108:43.96]Okay.
[108:47.72]Enter IRS position.
[108:54.34]Coordinates.
[108:55.84]It should be on there.
[108:56.66]Go to your present position page.
[109:01.39]That's POS?
[109:01.87]Or, uh... Is that, uh... From your master index page, I believe it's the second one down, POS.
[109:12.03]Gotcha.
[109:12.31]And then...
[109:17.10]Okay, it looks like it's set here.
[109:24.44]IRS position.
[109:35.31]Enter IRS position.
[109:36.53]Okay, we're good there.
[109:37.49]Navigating.
[109:44.91]Let's see.
[109:58.41]Well, you know what?
[109:59.95]Who needs VNAV anyway?
[110:02.45]Who needs it, right?
[110:03.49]We know where we're going?
[110:05.68]Yeah, Los Angeles.
[110:06.70]We'll figure it out, right?
[110:08.08]Alright, let's get out of here.
[110:09.88]That's what pilots do, right?
[110:12.34]They just figure it out on the way.
[110:14.16]We got LNAV.
[110:15.40]We're good?
[110:17.66]Boston Air 101, you mentioned reset your auto brake system.
[110:32.48]Alright, we're cleared for takeoff.
[110:38.50]There you go.
[110:39.08]Okay, Jerma, put your hands on the throttle.
[110:42.28]Okay.
[110:42.96]And then when you get to that point, hit that button, that black button.
[110:45.68]Up to 40%.
[110:46.00]Up to 40%.
[110:46.22]There you go.
[110:47.55]The percentage is where?
[110:50.39]Is right here.
[110:51.79]Nice and slow, don't want to go too fast.
[110:56.33]And then hit that black button when you're ready.
[111:02.41]There you go.
[111:02.93]And now this goes up.
[111:05.74]And then we go straight here.
[111:08.12]I'm keeping it straight for you.
[111:09.30]You're keeping it straight?
[111:10.60]Yep.
[111:10.94]So now I don't have to keep my hands on this?
[111:12.88]No, keep your hands on it until I say V1.
[111:16.28]Then put both hands on the wheel.
[111:18.34]Alright, B1.
[111:19.12]B1.
[111:19.44]Alright.
[111:20.52]Now start pulling back.
[111:21.70]Pulling back.
[111:22.72]Start pulling back.
[111:23.54]Here we go.
[111:24.06]Nice job.
[111:25.00]Get it up to that pink.
[111:25.99]Nice job.
[111:27.17]Keep it steady.
[111:28.01]Keep pulling up.
[111:29.09]Put that in the crosshairs, the pink.
[111:31.37]Yeah.
[111:31.63]Alright.
[111:32.05]Don't pull up too much.
[111:32.95]You're pulling up too much.
[111:34.63]Oops.
[111:35.51]Push it down to below 20.
[111:36.95]You're pulling up too much.
[111:38.21]Push down.
[111:38.63]Push down.
[111:39.17]Push down.
[111:40.03]Quite aggressively, actually.
[111:41.59]Push down.
[111:41.85]You're up at almost 30 degrees.
[111:44.49]Push it down.
[111:45.07]Push it down.
[111:45.63]Push it down.
[111:47.07]There you go.
[111:47.91]You see the degree marks where it's between 10 and... There you go.
[111:50.53]There are a lot of numbers on the screen.
[111:52.61]Yeah, I know.
[111:53.15]I know.
[111:53.69]You're good.
[111:54.93]You're doing great.
[111:55.75]Hey!
[111:56.58]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[111:58.10]Take your hands off.
[111:59.60]There you go.
[112:00.04]Keep it in the... Keep it steady.
[112:02.54]You see where... You see between...
[112:04.50]You see the crosshairs there?
[112:05.66]Right there.
[112:06.76]Keep it, no, yeah.
[112:08.34]Right here, right?
[112:08.90]Yeah.
[112:09.02]You're up a little too high.
[112:10.72]A little bit?
[112:11.42]A little too high.
[112:12.48]Push it down.
[112:13.04]Push it down?
[112:13.92]Below 20, preferably.
[112:15.59]Below 20?
[112:16.21]Yeah, and do it aggressively.
[112:18.01]You see your speed dropping rapidly?
[112:20.09]Yeah, that's not good.
[112:20.97]We good?
[112:21.31]Yeah, you're good.
[112:22.41]Now, I want you to start making a left-hand turn.
[112:26.57]There you go.
[112:26.97]Left.
[112:27.33]Aggressively or no?
[112:29.85]That's good.
[112:30.31]That's good.
[112:31.11]Okay.
[112:31.33]Do you see your black, the black crosshair right there?
[112:34.15]Yeah.
[112:34.29]I want you to move that black square in between the center of where the pink line intersects.
[112:40.59]Easy.
[112:40.88]Does that make sense?
[112:41.82]I got it.
[112:42.28]Just follow that and keep it right there where they're intersecting.
[112:46.22]You're doing amazing.
[112:47.76]You're doing amazing.
[112:48.86]See?
[112:50.30]Are you kidding me?
[112:54.46]I really, honestly, I haven't seen anything like it.
[112:56.89]I think landing this plane is going to be easy.
[112:59.43]You think so?
[112:59.89]I think you're going to do great, Jerma.
[113:05.25]And by the way, can you put your hands, make sure there's no magic trick, no strings here, no strings here.
[113:11.71]Can you help me, please?
[113:13.97]Hands off, chap.
[113:15.00]No, no, there's no strings on mine.
[113:17.92]No strings above, no strings below, right?
[113:21.68]Although I am kind of... Okay, you see, you gotta follow the lines there, Jerma, but that's okay.
[113:26.46]Keep it at 15 degrees, that's alright.
[113:29.16]Okay, so I'm pushing down then.
[113:31.34]Yeah, you should be pushing down.
[113:32.70]See how you're drifting up?
[113:34.80]That's too high.
[113:36.74]So one thing you gotta keep in mind is your speed, okay?
[113:40.35]And where is the speed?
[113:41.43]It's right here.
[113:42.19]On the left?
[113:43.93]It's right here, there's the speed right there.
[113:45.89]Oh, 190, okay.
[113:46.51]Yep.
[113:49.57]You sure it's ready?
[113:50.15]Alright, just keeping it there, keeping it there.
[113:52.49]Chat says they're scared.
[113:54.41]But you know what?
[113:55.01]Relax.
[113:55.53]The beauty is we got really smooth air.
[113:57.88]So I'm going to turn off that seat belt sign.
[114:00.12]Right now?
[114:00.66]Yeah.
[114:00.92]It's alright.
[114:03.06]We're smooth.
[114:07.52]You're making it a little more difficult, I see.
[114:11.56]OK.
[114:11.66]So you put all those pink crosshairs.
[114:14.44]We're going to go direct to Susie.
[114:25.65]You know, uh... I hate to report this, but, um... What?
[114:30.11]The flight management computer's not really working for us.
[114:36.35]So what does that mean?
[114:37.67]Well... I hope we can get to Los Angeles.
[114:40.78]Are we going the right way?
[114:43.62]Yeah, I think so.
[114:50.62]Just keep it steady there, Jonah.
[114:52.26]Keep it steady.
[114:53.18]Don't do too many dramatic movements.
[114:55.76]I'm trying to keep it as steady here as I can.
[115:03.52]Really, this is just a game of put square in center of pink lines.
[115:08.88]Yep.
[115:09.85]That's it.
[115:10.69]That's it.
[115:19.34]101, did I hear a report of loss of FMC?
[115:22.32]Yes, we've got a loss of FMC.
[115:25.24]We've lost all navigation on our FMC.
[115:27.41]Follow that big line.
[115:30.93]We've lost the control of our FMC.
[115:35.33]It doesn't seem to know where we are.
[115:38.33]So we've got a pink line that we can follow.
[115:42.33]That's about as close as we can get.
[115:43.89]I'm just, are we gonna circle?
[115:46.35]Just keep following the pink line, Jeremy, you got it.
[115:54.15]Oh, Roger that.
[115:54.87]Alright, he's gonna give us vectors.
[115:56.49]Screw the FMC.
[115:57.76]Okay.
[116:03.78]Okay, right at 135, I'm sitting at 101.
[116:06.68]Alright, turn it right.
[116:08.58]So you see that dash line?
[116:11.83]Jerma, I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm gonna turn on the other side.
[116:15.47]Let go.
[116:18.29]You're doing fantastic.
[116:19.27]Did I do a bad job?
[116:20.33]No, you did a great job, but we're about to stall.
[116:24.81]So I need to give control back to the autopilot.
[116:27.29]You can't say.
[116:28.75]You're doing a great job.
[116:30.16]Oh, by the way, we're about to stall.
[116:32.16]No, but see the speed?
[116:33.00]We're about to actually, like, you see how it's getting to the yellow right there?
[116:37.20]Yeah.
[116:39.96]The throttle's on.
[116:44.56]There we go.
[116:45.34]There we go.
[116:45.84]But don't worry.
[116:46.42]Here we go.
[116:46.84]We've got our vertical speed.
[116:47.93]Okay.
[116:50.45]Let's see.
[116:51.21]We're using a different function this flight.
[116:53.27]Oh, I see.
[116:53.75]I get it.
[116:54.47]I get it.
[116:54.85]I get it.
[116:55.05]Alright.
[116:56.07]Full speed ahead to Los Angeles.
[116:57.61]That's pretty good.
[117:00.34]Hey, nice job.
[117:01.62]Chad, what do you rate his takeoff out of 10?
[117:03.08]Rate my takeoff.
[117:03.64]I want to know.
[117:07.46]Chad, what do you think?
[117:11.29]That was at least a six.
[117:12.91]It was good.
[117:14.15]I actually think that you performed better than anybody that I've seen as a first-time pilot.
[117:19.55]Okay.
[117:20.22]Good.
[117:20.60]So you did great.
[117:21.70]I'll take it.
[117:22.38]You did fantastic.
[117:25.34]I see a lot of 7.5 out of 10s.
[117:26.78]That's better than a five.
[117:31.18]Yeah, much better than an F. Where are we at with Minority Pilot?
[117:34.69]How much have we donated so far?
[117:39.55]Yeah, you're a prodigy.
[117:42.47]I'd like to hear.
[117:50.09]Good.
[117:50.61]We've raised almost $8,000 for Minority Pilot.
[117:53.26]Unbelievable.
[117:53.90]Nice claps in the chat.
[117:55.88]Thank you, guys.
[117:57.54]Can we get to $8,000?
[117:58.68]$50.
[117:59.00]We just got $50.
[118:00.08]I think we're getting to $10,000.
[118:07.81]If we get to $10,000, I will crash this plane!
[118:10.97]I'm just kidding.
[118:11.53]No, don't.
[118:11.99]I'm kidding.
[118:13.64]Hey, I'm the one in control.
[118:15.16]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[118:15.68]We got traffic.
[118:16.66]What?
[118:17.54]See?
[118:19.58]What's that?
[118:25.35]Oh.
[118:25.55]Oh, I'm sorry.
[118:28.35]That was scary.
[118:29.09]It was a little scary.
[118:30.01]Sometimes those things happen.
[118:34.19]This plane is coming in here.
[118:36.97]It's no conflict.
[118:37.79]It's about 1,300 feet.
[118:38.85]Oh, there it is right there.
[118:39.84]See?
[118:41.00]It's right there.
[118:42.92]No worries.
[118:43.66]Hey, wave.
[118:44.78]Hey, how you doing?
[118:46.50]Traffic.
[118:47.52]Traffic.
[118:48.10]Forget about it.
[118:48.72]It's okay.
[118:49.38]It's 1,000 feet above us.
[118:50.80]We're good.
[118:51.70]It's 1,000 feet.
[118:52.30]It's not an issue.
[118:54.02]It's all good.
[118:55.74]Very good.
[118:56.26]Very good.
[118:57.86]Uh, Los Angeles Center, we're going to need vectors and descent instructions when required into LAX, as well as ILS information for runway 24R.
[119:07.99]Are we almost there?
[119:17.99]Roger.
[119:18.31]101.
[119:18.33]That's a quick flight.
[119:19.83]Are we almost there?
[119:20.51]No, we're not almost there, but we are going to be traveling at a faster speed to make sure that we get there a lot faster.
[119:26.30]I'm actually going to increase the speed here.
[119:29.70]Chad, you having a good time back there?
[119:33.18]Oh, I want to add, so when you're a passenger in a plane, and you order a drink, whatever it is, you were asking me this question before we encountered life-threatening conditions.
[119:44.25]Oxygen masks.
[119:45.47]Just give me the can of pineapple juice.
[119:50.13]Can of apple juice?
[119:51.09]Pineapple juice.
[119:51.63]I don't want the cup.
[119:52.29]I don't want the ice.
[119:53.01]You just want the can of pineapple juice.
[119:56.67]What do you do?
[119:57.68]For a drink.
[119:58.56]Yeah.
[120:00.66]My favorite drink on a plane is water.
[120:08.32]Okay.
[120:09.20]Your choice.
[120:09.76]Or a stiff glass of Coca-Cola.
[120:12.68]Both phenomenal choices.
[120:14.14]Or Pepsi.
[120:14.66]Yeah, whatever they have.
[120:16.38]Whatever they got.
[120:16.90]Right.
[120:17.08]I do cranberry juice too.
[120:18.28]Cranberry juice is good.
[120:19.57]Cranberry juice is good too.
[120:21.45]I also, when I'm feeling a little anxious, when we get turbulence, which...
[120:26.69]Thank God we don't have any.
[120:30.13]Wait for it.
[120:30.91]Every time you say it, it happens.
[120:32.55]I order a Bloody Mary.
[120:34.85]Really?
[120:35.32]Yeah.
[120:36.30]Bloody Mary.
[120:37.00]I can't drink on an airplane.
[120:38.32]You can't drink on an airplane?
[120:40.02]No, it makes me feel like shit.
[120:41.80]Really?
[120:42.12]Yeah, I just feel awful.
[120:43.84]Really?
[120:43.98]I think it's the altitude.
[120:46.18]The only place I can drink is really on an airplane.
[120:48.39]Really?
[120:48.81]Yeah.
[120:49.33]Wow.
[120:50.53]It's great.
[120:53.95]Ooh, Dr. Pepper's great.
[120:56.12]That's a good choice, too.
[120:58.06]Both phenomenal choices.
[120:59.44]Both phenomenal choices, absolutely.
[121:04.10]Chat, what's your favorite drink on a plane?
[121:06.38]You know, we're getting a little turbulence.
[121:08.20]Would you mind turning on the seatbelt sign this time?
[121:14.82]Oh, one more.
[121:19.02]I thought I did it the first time.
[121:21.72]Are they alright?
[121:23.38]That's a little epic.
[121:24.52]We are approaching Sussie, you're right.
[121:26.62]See, it's a little Sussie.
[121:28.18]Let me see if I can pull that up over here.
[121:30.56]No, we can't.
[121:33.61]Oh yeah, there it is, right there.
[121:35.13]It's either Susie or Sussie.
[121:36.97]Susie or Sussie, I don't know which one.
[121:39.47]Susie.
[121:43.86]So chat says whiskey.
[121:45.02]I see somebody say whiskey in the chat.
[121:47.40]Yeah, too harsh.
[121:48.20]Yeah, very much.
[121:48.88]A little too harsh.
[121:49.82]Very much.
[121:50.20]Absolutely.
[121:52.60]You know what?
[121:55.41]You know what I realized, Jermis?
[121:56.87]We didn't fuel up the week before we left.
[122:04.73]Yeah, we didn't.
[122:07.58]Yeah, we did.
[122:08.00]Did we?
[122:08.79]No, I'm just saying it to make sure that we... I'm using the power of, like, yeah, we did, so then it's like, yeah, actually, we did.
[122:15.49]But we didn't.
[122:17.39]No, we did.
[122:17.91]Didn't we?
[122:19.45]Did we?
[122:22.37]How do you tell?
[122:22.89]But because you said that I have confidence that we did.
[122:26.25]Where's the indicator?
[122:28.36]Where's, like, the E?
[122:30.40]Oh, like on a car?
[122:31.82]Yeah.
[122:32.16]Does that have one?
[122:32.84]No.
[122:34.01]It's right here.
[122:36.19]17,600 pounds of fuel.
[122:38.50]8,670 pounds in the left tanks, 8,670 pounds on the right, and none in the center tanks.
[122:44.92]So watch.
[122:45.54]There's none in the center tanks.
[122:46.60]Watch what happens when I turn these on.
[122:47.84]It's going to say, it's going to pop up and say flight controls.
[122:53.01]It's not true.
[122:55.59]Jeremy, you want to know what it's like to operate a plane without hydraulics?
[123:01.25]Do I want to say yes to this question?
[123:03.32]Chad?
[123:06.73]You want to see what it's like to operate a plane without hydraulics?
[123:10.57]Now, what environment would this happen in?
[123:14.83]Any environment in which you lose hydraulics.
[123:16.94]So what do the hydraulics do for the plane?
[123:19.71]Well, okay, so imagine this, right?
[123:21.85]You're in your car.
[123:22.43]In your car.
[123:23.35]And you have power steering.
[123:24.61]Power steering.
[123:24.99]And you run out of power steering fluid.
[123:26.97]Right.
[123:27.29]Right?
[123:27.85]What happens?
[123:28.83]It's really hard to move.
[123:30.11]You've got to manually turn the wheel.
[123:31.59]Imagine that, but with a commercial airliner.
[123:34.63]Sounds terrifying.
[123:35.55]Yeah.
[123:36.19]So we're flying a Boeing 737-800NG, new generation.
[123:41.29]This is not the MAX, right?
[123:44.39]So a little lesson here, folks.
[123:48.24]This is the NG.
[123:49.88]The MAX is what had the MCAS situation.
[123:52.07]This plane does not have MCAS on board.
[123:55.23]MCAS was the system that caused a lot of problems with the MAX.
[123:58.90]This is the NG.
[124:00.86]I don't know why I was telling you.
[124:03.14]But anyway, this is 737-800.
[124:03.86]It's good context.
[124:05.74]The Boeing plane, I believe, it's like a pulley system.
[124:10.13]So these are actually, there's like a steel cable, right, that's connected to this yoke right here that actually literally is connected to the elevators and the rudders and everything like that.
[124:20.65]So when you lose hydraulics, you actually have to use your man's strength or woman's strength or whatever strength you've got.
[124:27.93]Hold on.
[124:28.81]to pull it and try to make sure that you keep the plane steady.
[124:33.65]So we won't do it now, but upon our descent into Los Angeles, I'll cut the hydraulics for a minute and I'll have you try to manage.
[124:42.25]See what it's like?
[124:42.83]Yeah.
[124:43.37]Okay.
[124:44.92]Alright.
[124:45.82]You're adding mods.
[124:46.50]Yeah, absolutely.
[124:48.84]You're adding variables.
[124:50.54]Now, Jerma, I just want to let you know, I trust you so much.
[124:55.76]to land this plane safely.
[124:57.26]And you should because I'm going to land this safely.
[124:59.79]Do you have any questions about how do you land a plane?
[125:03.57]So I'm going to control the throttle for you.
[125:06.91]You're going to keep that black thing in between those lines and you're going to look out at the runway.
[125:11.48]Make sure we're in the right spot.
[125:13.26]Right before landing, 50, 40, 30.
[125:15.32]You're going to pull back so you can flare to make it soft.
[125:20.98]Okay.
[125:21.34]Okay.
[125:22.89]One thing that you don't want to do is... So when you say pull back, you mean like physically pull back?
[125:27.37]Yes.
[125:28.98]To 30?
[125:29.18]No, not 30 degrees.
[125:30.28]You'll tail strike.
[125:30.78]Okay.
[125:31.48]I'm just saying pull the nose back slightly.
[125:33.32]Okay, like... So basically you're going like this, right?
[125:37.96]And then you want to go like this.
[125:39.34]And you slow your descent right at the end.
[125:41.08]Okay.
[125:41.70]And then you land like that.
[125:43.72]Sounds good.
[125:44.08]Austin Airways.
[125:50.04]Want you to do it for me?
[125:51.49]Turn left heading 115, Austin Air 101.
[125:55.73]115, turning left.
[125:56.31]So you see the plane is turning left?
[125:58.87]Ooh, that's nice.
[125:59.51]Isn't that nice?
[126:00.77]Yeah.
[126:01.45]This is literally what pilots do.
[126:02.95]I don't have to make anybody throw up?
[126:04.66]No.
[126:05.72]This is literally what pilots do.
[126:08.84]Now, uh...
[126:17.04]Ladies and gentlemen, please, flight attendants, please be seated.
[126:20.54]Oh, excuse me, flight attendants, please be seated.
[126:25.04]Whoa.
[126:25.26]By the way, I've never landed a plane before.
[126:26.94]No, don't tell them that.
[126:28.02]Don't tell them that?
[126:28.70]No.
[126:28.88]Are you kidding me?
[126:31.06]Could you imagine if you heard that coming from the back?
[126:33.86]I've never landed a plane before.
[126:35.29]Hold on, let me.
[126:37.47]He's just kidding.
[126:38.57]He's just kidding.
[126:39.11]Just kidding.
[126:40.03]It's a good joke.
[126:40.79]Our first officer is a real jokester.
[126:45.95]That was actually kind of scary.
[126:47.21]Yeah, that would be very, very scary.
[126:49.92]This is relaxing.
[126:52.40]It's very nice and relaxing.
[126:54.36]Oh.
[126:54.46]Oh, that's it.
[126:54.86]That was the damn problem.
[126:58.14]What happened?
[126:59.54]That was the problem the whole time, I think.
[127:07.42]Wrong coordinates?
[127:08.52]Yep.
[127:10.04]Well, let's see if it fixes it.
[127:16.20]No, I didn't.
[127:18.42]So we are, we're off course here, right?
[127:21.11]No, we've got, we've got, we've got a ATC is guiding us in.
[127:25.21]And so everything's all good.
[127:27.49]So this is the route this way where we were supposed to be in this pink line, right?
[127:32.63]Yeah, but we're on a new route.
[127:34.49]We're going the same direction.
[127:35.51]We're going south to Los Angeles.
[127:38.31]And we're at a rapid pace.
[127:40.56]We're flying a little faster than you normally would.
[127:50.96]Roger, Austin Air 101.
[127:51.90]Roger that.
[127:54.12]He's got us 133 miles from the airport.
[127:57.66]Why don't you give a cabin announcement?
[127:59.82]Make sure the flight attendants start getting things prepared.
[128:02.20]You know what?
[128:02.94]Instead of that, give them an announcement of what they can expect.
[128:05.68]You know how the captains say we're 133 miles from Los Angeles?
[128:08.86]What time we're landing?
[128:09.64]What game we're parking at?
[128:10.46]You know all that information.
[128:11.12]I'm going to give them an announcement.
[128:12.84]Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently about to start our, not quite yet, but our descent into Los Angeles, coming up here soon in 115 miles.
[128:22.35]I will make sure to let you know exactly when that time is, but just be prepared, that will be being announced imminently.
[128:28.54]Also, I want to just say really quickly, if you had a chance on your in-flight movies to watch Hubie Halloween, it was available, and it is quite the film.
[128:38.00]I know some of you have been asking about when it would return to our in-flight entertainment systems.
[128:43.82]It is there.
[128:44.98]You have about, I want to say, maybe 25 minutes or so to skim through the whole movie, which I think is probably best.
[128:53.23]But yeah, it's available for you there.
[128:54.83]We'll make sure to update you.
[128:55.59]If you look out your right side window, by the way, you can see...
[128:58.17]We are currently flying over.
[129:01.59]That is the Southern California desert space.
[129:06.51]And there is, very famously, Death Valley is there.
[129:10.40]Which, if you don't know what Death Valley is, big desert, probably the hottest place in the entire world in Death Valley.
[129:16.32]If you didn't know that, that's just a little, you know, a little bit of pilot fun for you.
[129:21.44]Also, too, I want to make sure to...
[129:24.61]I also want to make sure that people understand that we are going to be descending, and your gate, your gate for your luggage, I don't know yet.
[129:34.54]I actually, I was told one thing and then another, and then, I mean, it's been kind of an annoying day, I'll be honest with you.
[129:41.10]I woke up at, I don't know, at 9 o'clock this morning.
[129:44.42]I was supposed to get up at 8.
[129:45.48]It was really irritating.
[129:46.40]I just seriously had, like, a bad headache.
[129:49.71]I just needed to, I took some Tylenol, so I think I'll be alright.
[129:53.13]But I...
[129:55.47]Alright, what do we... Long story short, we'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 25 minutes.
[130:02.78]And have a nice day.
[130:07.22]Don't you hate when you're on a plane and you're watching a movie and you get an announcement and it says announcement in progress and it interrupts the programming that you're trying to watch and they just won't shut up.
[130:22.58]They're just sitting there like...
[130:24.30]And I'd like to take this moment to tell you about the Delta Airlines credit card.
[130:27.37]Right, but important information comes through there.
[130:30.17]Yeah.
[130:30.29]Very important information comes through.
[130:31.93]I mean, sometimes.
[130:33.23]I also love when you can't hear it because it's so low that you can't even hear what the pilot is saying.
[130:38.38]Right, or it's too loud.
[130:39.64]Oh, yeah.
[130:40.38]Or it's just like, you know, a lot of feedback.
[130:41.72]I'm just going to apologize about that.
[130:45.49]Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make sure I say I apologize for interrupting your movie or your TV program.
[130:52.34]It's been a long day.
[130:53.24]I just want to make sure you understand that.
[130:54.96]And by the way, hey, the Sprite is free on me today.
[131:04.12]It's always free.
[131:04.95]It's always free.
[131:07.01]Always free.
[131:08.65]Should I give him a coupon?
[131:09.27]Yeah.
[131:34.22]This is so crazy.
[131:35.40]Isn't this nuts?
[131:37.34]I keep forgetting that I'm actually sitting up here doing this.
[131:41.16]Yeah, I got it.
[131:43.86]Yep, I got it.
[131:46.67]Alright, so I need you to hit 108.5 over here.
[131:50.55]108.5.
[131:50.79]Yep.
[131:51.85]That's .5?
[131:52.13]Oh, I thought you meant 108.5.
[131:54.27]No, no, no, here.
[131:56.13]Jerma, so this is what you do.
[131:57.82]So this one's for this side, the top knob, and then the bottom knob.
[132:03.54]And then, Jerma, you know what we want to do?
[132:05.46]We want to make it active.
[132:06.42]So what do we do?
[132:07.26]Press the activate button.
[132:10.06]Holy shit.
[132:11.41]Would you look at that?
[132:13.79]Would you look at that?
[132:15.84]Smooth air.
[132:17.26]Smooth sailing all the way into the airport.
[132:19.64]That's right.
[132:20.16]God, every time.
[132:25.76]Every time we turn on that seatbelt sign.
[132:27.80]Should I let him know?
[132:28.57]Yeah, let him know.
[132:30.95]Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for the interruption again, but there is turbulence.
[132:34.31]I want you to make sure you stay in your seats.
[132:36.03]Seatbelt sign is active.
[132:37.43]Oh, let him know there's no more turbulence.
[132:39.55]And there is no more turbulence as of right now.
[132:41.43]You are free to go back to what you were doing.
[132:44.65]Actually, sit back down again.
[132:46.41]It's very important that you sit.
[132:48.47]We're just experiencing a little bit more turbulence.
[132:51.13]Please put your seatbelts on if you have them.
[132:52.89]Again, no smoking.
[132:55.04]You can stand up if you'd like.
[132:56.08]Stretch your legs a little bit.
[132:58.00]I know it gets a little long on these planes.
[132:59.44]Sit down immediately.
[133:01.44]I don't want anybody to see you standing.
[133:02.78]We can see you back there, so do not stand up.
[133:05.34]Sit down immediately.
[133:07.27]Thank you.
[133:07.59]I appreciate it.
[133:09.38]And if you could, please, now's the time to use the bathroom.
[133:11.99]Now's the time for you to get up and you have to, you know, use the toilet.
[133:15.87]It's a good time to do it.
[133:17.24]And I want to make sure to let everybody know here that after the plane lands, I will be... I will.
[133:31.39]We're 50 miles from the airport.
[133:33.27]Just want to make sure we haven't got that ear there.
[133:36.50]But when we land, I will be performing at the local Two Swigs is the name of the bar.
[133:44.82]And it's a performance art that I do.
[133:47.70]I do a little bit of singing and dancing.
[133:52.35]Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
[133:54.19]I'd like to apologize.
[133:56.03]We're about to start our initial descent into Los Angeles.
[133:59.55]where the weather is currently 70 degrees and monsoon-like conditions.
[134:06.32]I'm hearing that there's a huge possibility for record winds and lots of bad, bad weather, hail, snow, sleet.
[134:16.30]Why are you looking at me?
[134:18.32]He's like, yeah, that's what's happening.
[134:20.16]You're telling me this.
[134:21.00]We're going to ask the flight attendants to secure the cabin early to ensure their safety.
[134:27.49]We know you have many choices when you fly.
[134:28.77]We do appreciate you choosing Austin Show Airlines.
[134:30.55]We'll be on the ground in about 20 minutes.
[134:33.59]Alright, dispatch.
[134:34.41]For those of you that were sleeping, good morning.
[134:36.63]Alright, dispatch, Austin Show Air 101.
[134:43.45]Looking forward to send instructions when able.
[134:49.29]Fucking annoying airline pilot.
[134:53.98]Do you think everybody on this plane after that gives a one-star review?
[134:58.67]You know, it's like airlines like spirit.
[135:04.31]Yeah.
[135:04.57]I don't know why people can flip on it.
[135:15.60]All this routine.
[135:16.14]Play level 1-0, we're down to 10,000 feet.
[135:21.27]Lost your show 101.
[135:21.83]Alright, Jerma, we're going to start our descent.
[135:26.01]Now, like last time, we're anticipating quite a few bumps, quite a bit of weather.
[135:30.99]So I'll have you make that cabin announcement shortly.
[135:34.11]Oh, yes.
[135:35.04]Yes.
[135:35.50]So what we do need to do is start our descent here.
[135:40.60]So we're going to slowly start descending about 2,500 feet per minute.
[135:45.50]And I'm going to have you flip on that seatbelt sign.
[135:49.32]And I like... No, no.
[135:51.64]Not yet.
[135:52.65]Do the whole, you know the flight captain thing?
[135:55.17]Where the captains go, ah, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
[136:01.88]Ah, we're just about to begin our initial descent, so we're going to turn on that seatbelt sign.
[136:09.44]Do ask you to get in your seat, says seatbelt sign's going to remain on for the rest of the flight.
[136:15.54]You know what I mean?
[136:16.26]How they, in the middle of their speech, they flip on the seatbelt.
[136:19.46]So me doing this, we did this twice.
[136:21.06]Right.
[136:21.24]Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please take your seats.
[136:25.72]We're going to just put the seatbelt sign on here.
[136:28.72]There you go.
[136:30.16]Our descent will be in about, I want to say, 60 seconds.
[136:34.83]We'll be starting our descent.
[136:36.67]We're already starting it.
[136:37.77]Well, we're going to be finishing our descent in about 60 seconds.
[136:40.43]No way.
[136:41.91]Whatever that time frame may be, I'm being told a few different things from some people in the cockpit, which is annoying.
[136:50.78]And we can see a little bit of lightning here.
[136:52.62]That's good.
[136:57.50]That's good.
[136:57.92]That's good.
[136:59.44]We're descending.
[137:00.24]We are descending.
[137:05.08]Alright, Jerma.
[137:05.58]Is it time?
[137:07.50]No.
[137:08.63]No, it's not.
[137:10.01]We're very, very quickly, he's gonna give us instructions here.
[137:14.55]But look, Jerma, I'll let you know when it's time, but you got your hands in the right position.
[137:19.30]We're just descending right now.
[137:27.14]Should I land play like an old grandma?
[137:28.98]You have kits?
[137:31.02]Good.
[137:33.52]Good.
[137:35.96]That's good.
[137:37.84]He's trying to get a good fuse.
[137:45.30]Oh, yeah, there's a bit.
[137:47.63]Can't quite see the landing station yet.
[137:52.25]Oh, you go.
[137:54.73]You can go.
[137:58.87]Oh, man.
[138:00.33]Being a pilot's easy.
[138:02.85]This actually... It's really intimidating.
[138:05.88]Traffic.
[138:06.58]Traffic.
[138:07.12]Oh, shit.
[138:08.88]Okay, that is coming.
[138:09.86]Where are they coming from?
[138:11.00]Are they descending into us?
[138:12.04]Climb.
[138:12.30]Climb.
[138:12.80]Oh, shit.
[138:13.86]Wait, climb?
[138:16.45]I got control.
[138:17.13]I have control.
[138:19.37]I have control.
[138:22.69]No, you don't beatbox!
[138:38.14]That was very, very close.
[138:43.25]That was extremely close, Jerma.
[138:45.73]Holy shit.
[138:46.55]You get interrupted in just a minute.
[138:57.15]Okay.
[138:59.31]Don't worry.
[139:00.23]So chat, that is a TCAS warning, traffic collision avoidance system.
[139:03.85]Every commercial aircraft is equipped with it.
[139:06.29]So if you have a fear of flying, there are systems in place.
[139:09.48]One of your fears is aircraft collision, something like that.
[139:12.78]They've got systems in place to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[139:17.12]First of all, it's not going to happen because air traffic controllers are directing to make sure traffic doesn't hit each other.
[139:21.97]But the event that air traffic control fails to do that, there is a fail safe.
[139:27.04]Seeing how all this stuff works really does put it into perspective.
[139:39.73]Right heading 180, down to 8,000 feet.
[139:41.19]Boston Shooter.
[139:55.92]Roger will expect a spiraling approach We don't want to see this is you don't want to pull this past this point watch what happens That's not that was not good.
[140:09.01]That's not weird.
[140:09.47]Yeah You don't want to do what I was gonna say was yeah airplanes are very intimidating Yes, they're big.
[140:20.03]There's all kinds of stuff up here all these
[140:23.08]It's almost like it seems impossible that somebody could do this.
[140:27.26]But I think sitting up here actually does give you a lot of perspective as to the systems that are really in place on an airplane.
[140:35.38]It's actually been a great educational experience.
[140:37.78]It actually makes my flights that I take going forward, I feel like that much more interesting because I kind of know what's going on up here.
[140:45.53]And you know what's even crazier, Jerma, is the fact that you and I
[140:50.23]have been able to successfully land at least once.
[140:53.43]That's right.
[140:55.15]And from takeoff to touchdown with no guidance from anybody but me and you.
[141:02.78]And it's truly remarkable.
[141:05.30]With proper training and proper licensing and all that.
[141:10.56]I do want to say, I do want to say,
[141:19.15]We haven't successfully landed the second time.
[141:21.26]No.
[141:22.76]But no matter what happens on this landing, you're a hell of a pilot.
[141:28.30]You're a hell of a pilot as well.
[141:30.44]But don't worry, I got this.
[141:32.24]You got it?
[141:32.54]I got this.
[141:33.06]Okay.
[141:34.38]I'm going to make this a smooth landing.
[141:38.40]You know what I realized?
[141:39.02]I heard a chuckle.
[141:40.20]You know what I just realized?
[141:41.18]That we've been carrying around the body of a flight attendant.
[141:46.77]Oh, you did say that.
[141:48.62]You said that like an hour ago.
[141:50.16]All because you left your phone at LAX.
[141:52.24]I've been... How selfish.
[141:55.88]I've been beatboxing into that thing.
[141:58.30]Yeah, you were beat... I mean, it's really incredible.
[142:04.12]Like, we've just been... It's just the body of a flight attendant back there.
[142:08.38]Thank goodness.
[142:10.00]We are descending at a very rapid pace.
[142:11.66]Should we pull it up a little?
[142:13.01]I got it.
[142:13.25]Go ahead.
[142:18.55]How are we doing on donations?
[142:19.93]Oh, yeah, let's check.
[142:20.69]How are we doing on donations?
[142:28.81]Let's see where we're at.
[142:32.71]Oh, $5.
[142:32.93]Here we go.
[142:33.81]$8,200.
[142:34.21]Can we get to $10,000 before Jerma lands?
[142:36.29]Before I land this plane.
[142:37.51]$10,000 for a minority pilot.
[142:44.22]Can we hit that before I land this plane?
[142:46.55]Before we land this plane.
[142:47.77]I'm going to land this plane.
[142:50.25]Yep.
[142:50.79]Five dollars.
[142:51.71]It's all it takes.
[142:52.39]Just a little bit.
[142:57.97]Well, we got a kiss for her.
[142:59.63]What was it?
[143:02.15]They're very, they're a homoerotic chat.
[143:04.17]Okay.
[143:05.61]They always want men.
[143:07.52]It's crazy.
[143:09.08]It's crazy.
[143:11.74]We're about to overspeed.
[143:13.04]That's great.
[143:19.33]Left hang 1-6-0.
[143:19.99]Customs check.
[143:21.17]Turn left.
[143:23.01]Should I operate this vehicle?
[143:26.81]Down to 6,000.
[143:27.55]Get that down to 6,000.
[143:28.71]Get us down to 6,000 square feet.
[143:30.33]Nope.
[143:30.87]Square feet.
[143:31.99]What was that?
[143:38.64]Lightning.
[143:41.30]It's a stormy day across the Pacific.
[143:45.05]You know, actually, I'm hearing there's snow in Los Angeles right now.
[143:50.89]That would be very strange.
[143:51.97]Yes.
[143:52.15]That would be an interesting thing.
[143:54.45]Yes.
[143:57.27]Very interesting.
[144:04.36]Whoa, what's going on here?
[144:07.38]Oh, we're losing altitude and things are happening very quickly, but we're back on track there.
[144:19.77]Alright, we're getting through the clouds here, Jerma, so it's going to get pretty violently bumpy.
[144:24.49]And when I say violent, I mean more than you've ever experienced so far today.
[144:35.05]I think we'll be alright.
[144:36.72]I think we'll be alright.
[144:38.70]Uh, Jeremiah, I need you to set your course to 251 here.
[144:41.96]251.
[144:42.06]Right over here.
[144:47.97]Left heading 09011.
[144:48.55]09011.
[144:48.57]Here, can you finish that for me?
[144:52.33]09011.
[144:52.51]Activated.
[144:52.87]You want a little foot air?
[145:03.44]Is that what that is?
[145:04.24]Yeah, pull that a little bit, but don't pull it too much.
[145:08.33]How far out?
[145:10.39]That's about good.
[145:15.01]Okay.
[145:16.03]Alright.
[145:16.29]Oh, you know when you're passing 10,000 feet?
[145:18.09]Yeah.
[145:18.59]See a little chap, 10,000 feet?
[145:20.25]You know when you're in a plane and you hear that?
[145:21.67]10,000 feet.
[145:33.12]I like how Jerma, even with the autopilot, is like this.
[145:35.32]The whole time.
[145:38.26]You know, I feel like with all this storm, I feel like there should be a guy, like a fishing boat captain back here, being like, oh, yeah, we're going to get through this storm.
[145:47.93]Oh, my God, my tie fell off.
[145:49.91]With a big pipe.
[145:53.43]Oh, these waters are crazy.
[145:57.49]It was here when a Criken came out.
[146:01.59]It's like, sir, can you sit back down in your seat?
[146:06.53]What are they doing in the cockpit?
[146:07.91]Austin Air 1-1-2, further left at 8-0-7-0.
[146:16.51]Left at 8-0-7-0, Austin Air 1-1-2.
[146:17.57]Alright.
[146:17.89]Alright.
[146:24.43]Continue.
[146:28.28]Adding 360.
[146:28.60]Could you finish that 360 to the left?
[146:30.58]There you go.
[146:35.09]There you go.
[146:35.73]0, 0, 0.
[146:36.11]That's 360.
[146:37.39]Wait.
[146:37.85]Oh.
[146:38.21]That's 360.
[146:39.19]Oh, OK.
[146:41.09]360 is directly north.
[146:42.29]In fact, let's increase our bank right over here.
[146:47.63]Bank.
[146:50.70]Is that it?
[146:55.02]You got it?
[146:55.80]Yep, I just got it.
[146:58.36]So it'll go to max bank here.
[147:00.42]This is max bank.
[147:01.66]Max bank.
[147:02.70]Right, 30 degrees.
[147:03.38]If you go any more than this, it'll go bank angle, bank angle.
[147:06.84]It will?
[147:07.32]Yeah, watch.
[147:09.50]No, I don't want to do it.
[147:14.45]No?
[147:14.55]Bank angle, bank angle.
[147:15.67]I was going to lip sync it.
[147:17.21]Yeah, bank angle, bank angle.
[147:20.17]We're getting close, Jerma.
[147:21.11]7,200 feet.
[147:22.45]Alright.
[147:24.77]I gotta get, I gotta maybe move in a little.
[147:26.91]Yep, get, get, get, get yourself in there.
[147:29.55]I gotta get in here.
[147:36.32]Caution, terrain.
[147:37.92]What?
[147:38.12]Terrain.
[147:41.56]Caution, terrain.
[147:42.20]What do you mean terrain?
[147:46.38]Terrain?
[147:46.64]What kind of terrain?
[147:49.33]2,500.
[147:49.39]Huh?
[147:49.47]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[147:51.19]I got it.
[147:56.69]I got it.
[147:57.01]I got it.
[147:57.66]You got it?
[147:58.08]Yeah, just keep it steady.
[147:59.02]I need to stop being so violent on it.
[148:03.88]Terrain is when you're about to crash.
[148:05.68]When you're about to crash.
[148:08.46]Excuse me?
[148:09.26]When you're about to hit terrain, that's when it says terrain.
[148:13.87]Can you set this to 10,000 for me?
[148:15.43]Yeah, I can.
[148:26.76]Okay, can you hit 330 over here?
[148:28.50]330, yep, got it.
[148:54.64]Alright, we got that set.
[148:55.82]We got our app set.
[149:00.01]Let's see here.
[149:02.67]I didn't know there were mountains over here.
[149:05.29]We can't really see them.
[149:06.69]They're not really visible.
[149:09.53]Not at all.
[149:10.07]And it's raining.
[149:10.79]It's snowing.
[149:12.13]That is snow.
[149:13.09]That is snow.
[149:15.77]Oh, my God.
[149:16.35]It's a Christmas miracle, Jeremy.
[149:17.72]It's snowing in Los Angeles.
[149:19.74]Is Santa up here?
[149:20.92]I don't know.
[149:21.62]I mean...
[149:27.82]That's the way you hear the sleigh bells.
[149:30.99]Oh, yeah.
[149:35.09]Do we go into a wormhole?
[149:36.67]I don't know what's happening here.
[149:40.73]I feel like this is what happens right before you get the game over screen.
[149:50.84]Yeah, no, don't worry.
[149:52.26]We're still flying.
[149:55.40]We're okay.
[149:56.16]Everything's good to go.
[150:03.26]We're good, I think.
[150:07.48]Oh, there's the snow.
[150:08.26]Look at that snowfall.
[150:10.74]Looks like we're going through space.
[150:11.72]Oh, there we go.
[150:13.38]It's alright.
[150:13.86]Sometimes... It seems like sometimes the audio from the camera cuts out.
[150:21.28]Ah, that's what it is.
[150:23.36]Makes sense, right?
[150:24.52]Sometimes that happens.
[150:25.61]An audio problem.
[150:26.53]Right, audio problem with the camera.
[150:30.17]Makes complete sense.
[150:31.43]We're okay.
[150:37.38]We're going through space right now.
[150:38.54]Yeah, well, don't worry.
[150:40.34]It's going to be rain.
[150:41.22]It's going to be raining, I think, or something.
[150:43.24]There's definitely severe weather.
[150:46.70]Snow or whatever it is, it's going to be severe.
[150:56.42]280.
[150:56.44]280.
[150:56.76]There you go.
[150:59.63]Zero, do I press a button?
[151:01.09]No, it's already selected.
[151:03.96]Now, Jerma, as we get closer, it's going to really... Okay, okay.
[151:06.78]Probably shouldn't have eaten the double large burrito before.
[151:39.98]Hey Dispatch, we got motion.
[151:41.06]It's very fun, man.
[151:50.21]It is fun.
[151:53.41]Oh!
[151:56.70]Did you just call the flight attendant?
[151:58.20]Flight attendant, me too.
[151:59.54]I just like to mess with them.
[152:01.18]I like to hear sounds.
[152:02.64]Yeah.
[152:03.87]Air conditioning?
[152:04.95]Is it wrong for the air conditioning?
[152:06.19]Oh, is there?
[152:07.45]It says air conditioning.
[152:12.41]Well, that sucks.
[152:13.93]You know what I mean?
[152:15.17]Does that mean there's no AC?
[152:16.30]I don't know how to handle that.
[152:18.56]Okay, alright, alright.
[152:19.20]I'm going to be honest with you.
[152:20.56]I don't know how to handle no air conditioning.
[152:24.35]Alright, Jerma, we're getting close.
[152:35.33]Pressurization pin?
[152:41.89]I think we'll be good with our air conditioning on, right?
[152:46.40]I think so.
[152:48.20]I think we'll be good.
[152:50.78]Alright.
[152:52.95]Okay.
[152:54.01]Okay, Jerma.
[152:54.61]I'm going to scream.
[152:55.65]Don't scream.
[152:57.13]I'm going to be collected.
[153:01.52]I'm going to be the best pilot that's landing this plane out of any guest that's ever, ever been on this show.
[153:09.94]Let's go ahead and make that statement.
[153:12.19]I think I'm going to land this very well.
[153:13.87]You think you're going to land this well?
[153:15.05]Chad, what do you think?
[153:15.79]Any takers?
[153:17.58]Okay, we're about to intercept the localizer, Jerma, so don't touch the yoke just yet.
[153:21.84]Just have your hands on it, but don't move it at all.
[153:24.04]Let it move itself.
[153:26.13]So when you do your tier list for best co-pilots, I'm going to be up in S. Yep.
[153:42.13]Alright, here we go.
[153:56.85]Can you tell the flight attendants to please be seated?
[153:58.89]Flight attendants, please be seated.
[154:05.93]Destination coming up, getting ready to land.
[154:07.57]By the way, enjoy Los Angeles.
[154:12.59]While you have a chance, if you look out your window, you will see nothing.
[154:16.56]Because we're in the middle of a gosh darn storm.
[154:20.45]Got it under control, though.
[154:21.25]I'm going to land this.
[154:22.05]It's going to be an S-tier pilot, by the way.
[154:24.11]When you all do your reviews, I want you to say thanks for the S-tier landing.
[154:27.28]And have a great rest of your evening.
[154:29.56]Landing short.
[154:31.64]Okay.
[154:32.92]Oh, my God.
[154:33.70]Okay.
[154:34.00]Okay.
[154:34.46]Okay.
[154:34.90]Don't worry.
[154:35.48]Don't worry.
[154:36.86]Everything's going to be fine.
[154:39.07]Just focus.
[154:40.27]Okay.
[154:42.21]Alright.
[154:42.93]S-tier.
[154:43.43]S-tier landing.
[154:44.01]Alright.
[154:45.23]We're going to start slowing down here.
[154:53.53]On two-four right is where we're going for.
[154:56.53]Two-four right.
[154:58.31]Oopsie.
[154:59.13]Do I get to get some here?
[155:00.87]Oh, we're on approach.
[155:01.99]The localizer is taking control.
[155:05.60]So the computer is, you don't need to move, don't move this.
[155:08.94]Just let it happen.
[155:09.98]Okay.
[155:10.94]I'm going to control your flaps.
[155:12.70]I'm sure the pilot in control.
[155:14.02]You got it?
[155:14.38]Alright.
[155:18.10]So let's see.
[155:20.92]Alright.
[155:21.78]So what you need to do, Jerma, when you turn off the autopilot, what you're going to do is you're going to keep that thing right in the middle.
[155:34.35]You see where the black things that go out like this?
[155:36.63]Yeah.
[155:37.23]Right?
[155:38.60]keep it level and keep the black square in the center of the crosshairs.
[155:44.86]And it's also going to lower and go up and down based on your glide slope.
[155:50.95]You see this little purple triangle here?
[155:57.60]You see how that's getting lower?
[156:00.22]That's your glide slope.
[156:03.22]When it hits, that's rain.
[156:05.16]That's snow.
[156:06.12]That is snow.
[156:06.96]Is it every single weather happening at the same time?
[156:10.20]Yes.
[156:10.54]It's snow.
[156:12.50]Be thankful it's not that bumpy.
[156:13.86]That's all I can say.
[156:14.96]I'd just like to call him just to let him know.
[156:24.55]A polar vortex?
[156:25.63]I don't even know what that is.
[156:26.93]A polar vortex?
[156:27.55]I'm going to be honest, I don't know what that is, but we're prepared for it.
[156:32.06]It's a League of Legends ultimate.
[156:33.66]Yep.
[156:34.30]There's a polar vortex in the area, Jerma.
[156:36.86]Okay.
[156:38.18]I'm not taking over for you, though.
[156:40.36]Only if we're about to die, we'll take over.
[156:42.21]Only if we're about to die.
[156:44.17]What's a polar vortex?
[156:45.25]I have no idea.
[156:46.03]Well, whatever, flat 12.
[156:49.03]Where's the runway?
[156:49.70]Austin Air 101 on course on Glideslope.
[156:54.38]On course on Glideslope.
[156:57.80]Austin Air 101, Los Angeles Tower with you.
[157:03.63]Where's the runway?
[157:05.03]It will be in front of you.
[157:06.11]Oh, it's about to peek through the clouds here.
[157:10.99]Right now, the plane is descending to the runway right now.
[157:15.17]So let's slow down here.
[157:16.14]Do you see it?
[157:17.88]It's straight ahead.
[157:21.31]It's so snowy.
[157:22.77]Actually, it probably should have the anti-ice on it.
[157:29.29]Oh, that doesn't help.
[157:31.03]That made it worse.
[157:32.34]Oh, boy.
[157:32.68]Jerma, don't worry.
[157:35.16]The plane is controlling itself.
[157:36.90]Okay.
[157:37.18]I think this is the polar vortex they were telling us about.
[157:43.16]I still got it.
[157:57.30]You're down flaps full.
[158:04.56]Okay.
[158:06.18]Oh, that's the autopilot.
[158:10.39]Okay.
[158:10.67]That's the autopilot.
[158:12.31]Here, let go of the stick.
[158:13.97]Okay.
[158:14.53]Let go, let go.
[158:15.41]I'm letting go.
[158:16.07]Let the plane take over.
[158:17.75]Because you moved it, so it disconnected the autopilot.
[158:19.99]Oh, right, right, right.
[158:21.44]So let it control itself for now.
[158:27.07]So, Jerma, right now you can't see anything.
[158:30.04]No.
[158:30.26]So there's nothing humanly you can do.
[158:32.38]Alright?
[158:33.10]You need to let the plane do its thing.
[158:36.72]Oh, boy.
[158:38.66]Yeah?
[158:40.25]Jerma, just let it do its thing, okay?
[158:42.13]Okay, it's doing its thing.
[158:43.23]Oh, boy.
[158:44.15]This is really rough.
[158:45.23]This is rough?
[158:45.93]This is really violent.
[158:47.71]Okay?
[158:47.87]Honestly, this is going to be a challenge for you.
[158:49.87]Just let the plane...
[158:53.12]Just let it do its thing, okay?
[158:54.54]We're going to be fine, okay?
[158:56.37]We're going to be fine, Jerma.
[159:00.45]Austin, I'm controlling it with my mind.
[159:02.23]Yes.
[159:04.21]Okay, I may have to take control of the throttles here.
[159:10.90]So, we're at an ILS approach.
[159:12.90]Yeah.
[159:13.32]So, Jerma, you're going to have to be fighting.
[159:15.52]When you disconnect the autopilot, you're going to be fighting the plane.
[159:18.02]Fighting the plane.
[159:18.80]To keep it within those crosshairs.
[159:20.50]You got it.
[159:20.96]Okay?
[159:21.20]I'm going to fight it.
[159:22.32]Okay?
[159:22.46]Okay.
[159:29.18]God, you'd think that... The current weather is blizzard.
[159:37.27]Blizzard condition.
[159:40.83]Sealing is at 2,000 feet.
[159:41.47]Blizzard condition, ceiling's at 2,000 feet, Roger.
[159:43.57]Are we sure we're in the right place?
[159:47.11]No, look, there's the map right there.
[159:49.12]We're headed right for the runway.
[159:50.22]The plane is doing a lot of great work.
[159:55.24]It actually is.
[159:57.12]I will tell you, this is building all of my confidence for ever flying in an airplane.
[160:01.36]Yeah, this is about, this is a condition.
[160:03.66]Whoa, okay.
[160:06.58]Alright.
[160:07.56]Just hold on there, Jerva.
[160:08.62]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[160:10.52]Hold on.
[160:13.36]Let it do its thing, okay?
[160:14.34]I ain't touching anything.
[160:15.54]The plane's going to handle it, right?
[160:20.54]We're in a polar vortex, is what they said.
[160:29.69]You're doing great, Jerma, isn't he doing?
[160:31.31]2,500.
[160:31.47]It's 2,500.
[160:31.69]We should be breaking through the clouds here.
[160:34.04]That's what they said the ceiling was.
[160:35.68]If we don't, that's okay.
[160:36.54]The plane's got it under control.
[160:37.44]Alright, landing checklist.
[160:40.60]Gear?
[160:41.64]Gear down.
[160:42.42]Three green.
[160:43.14]Flaps?
[160:43.98]30.
[160:44.08]249.
[160:44.10]111.1.
[160:45.42]Alright.
[161:04.47]Oh my God.
[161:05.71]Jerma?
[161:06.27]Yeah?
[161:06.91]If we don't make it out of this one... Yep?
[161:08.79]I just want to let you know, you're a great pilot, okay?
[161:12.87]Thank you so much.
[161:14.07]This may require both of us, alright?
[161:17.87]And by the way, I've got a bag under my bed that has 50 grand in it.
[161:21.40]What?
[161:21.58]I'm just trying to make sure somebody knows.
[161:23.76]50 grand?
[161:24.00]50 grand in a bag under my bed.
[161:25.16]Why is that much cash under your bed?
[161:26.78]I don't know.
[161:27.20]It's the case.
[161:28.02]Okay.
[161:28.92]For what?
[161:29.74]It's the case.
[161:30.28]I don't know.
[161:31.04]Alright.
[161:33.97]Oh my god.
[161:34.75]Well, actually, I've tapped into it a few times.
[161:36.25]It's probably more like $12 under there now.
[161:38.09]$12 grand?
[161:39.33]Maybe $11.
[161:39.91]Why'd you even tell us?
[161:40.69]Maybe like $5, actually.
[161:42.09]Alright.
[161:42.67]There's $5 grand under my belt.
[161:43.89]There's $5 grand under your belt?
[161:44.80]OK.
[161:44.86]Alright, Jerma.
[161:50.78]I may help you with this.
[161:51.84]OK.
[161:52.00]Just a little bit.
[161:52.90]But we're going to be doing it together if we have to.
[161:54.46]We'll do it together if we have to.
[161:56.14]We're just, we can't crash.
[161:58.62]No.
[161:59.06]Right?
[162:04.99]I don't know.
[162:06.43]What is that?
[162:07.67]That's an airport, not the one that we're looking for.
[162:09.71]That's the wrong airport?
[162:11.03]We're starting to peek through the clouds here.
[162:12.69]You see there's a runway over there?
[162:13.97]That is the same airport, just the other side of it.
[162:16.40]Okay.
[162:18.62]1,000.
[162:18.64]1,000 feet.
[162:23.08]Okay.
[162:26.19]Jerma, when we see the runway, I'm going to disconnect the autopilot.
[162:28.63]The plane will be under your control.
[162:30.86]Understood.
[162:31.66]Okay?
[162:32.40]Alright.
[162:32.80]Did you see the runway poking through?
[162:33.86]I have really sweaty hands.
[162:35.08]You see the runway poking through?
[162:36.32]There it is.
[162:36.72]There it is.
[162:37.18]Okay.
[162:38.22]Okay, the autopilot's disconnected.
[162:39.34]You have control of the plane.
[162:41.36]Jerma, Jerma, keep it within the pink thing.
[162:43.90]You're already going too high.
[162:44.74]That's alright.
[162:45.12]I got it under control.
[162:45.70]Push it down.
[162:46.26]Push it down.
[162:46.74]I'm under control.
[162:47.34]Push it down into the pink, in between the pink.
[162:49.77]Follow that pink line.
[162:50.45]I don't want to go too quickly.
[162:51.45]No, you're good.
[162:51.91]You're right.
[162:52.31]You're right.
[162:53.07]You're right, Charlie.
[162:54.55]Okay, now we can't see the runway anymore, just follow the pink line.
[162:56.93]You're off to the, you're off, you're off center, Jerma.
[162:59.58]You're off center, you see?
[163:01.96]Yep.
[163:02.58]Does that go up?
[163:04.31]No, no, no.
[163:05.09]Turn to the right.
[163:06.72]Go down.
[163:07.38]Go down.
[163:08.76]Yeah, your way, you see how you're going for the taxiway?
[163:12.59]Here, let's, here.
[163:13.39]Alright, there it is.
[163:14.81]Move to the left, because you're right in the middle.
[163:16.93]The left runway seems to be something that you're closer to.
[163:18.99]Oh, okay, so left runway right here?
[163:20.45]Yeah, yeah, but descend, descend.
[163:21.73]Go lower, lower, lower, lower.
[163:22.95]Push the nose down.
[163:23.81]Pretty aggressive.
[163:25.45]And to the, yeah, to the right now, right?
[163:28.23]Then you go straight down on this runway right here.
[163:31.02]Straighten out?
[163:31.64]Yep, straighten out.
[163:32.94]Keep it in that pink line.
[163:34.18]You're doing great.
[163:34.78]To the left.
[163:36.05]To the left a little bit.
[163:37.51]Alright, to the right now.
[163:38.67]Just stay straight.
[163:40.19]Okay.
[163:40.71]Sync rate.
[163:41.33]Okay, pull back just a little bit.
[163:45.13]50.
[163:45.21]40.
[163:45.23]Push back.
[163:45.78]Oh, boy.
[163:46.68]Okay, push back.
[163:47.60]Okay, hold on.
[163:48.56]To the side.
[163:49.62]There you go.
[163:51.28]30.
[163:51.30]40.
[163:51.38]Oh, my God. 10.
[163:55.65]Alright, we're okay!
[163:56.65]We're alright, we're alright!
[163:59.09]Alright!
[164:00.39]Oh my god!
[164:01.80]Oh my!
[164:02.18]We're doing it!
[164:04.14]We're on the ground!
[164:05.42]Well, we made it!
[164:06.36]We're on the ground!
[164:07.02]We made it!
[164:08.60]Oh my god!
[164:09.66]I may have smushed my balls, but it's okay.
[164:14.22]Oh my god!
[164:17.42]We made it!
[164:20.48]Oh, we just missed the light.
[164:22.20]I'm so glad!
[164:23.14]Oh my god, I do...
[164:25.42]Oh, we did it.
[164:27.32]We did it.
[164:29.43]We did it.
[164:29.81]We made it.
[164:30.49]We made it.
[164:30.91]Anything broken?
[164:31.85]No.
[164:32.69]We made it.
[164:34.39]We made it.
[164:37.79]Wow, it's a beautiful day all of a sudden.
[164:43.11]Oh, that snowstorm seems to be gone completely.
[164:47.49]No snow anymore.
[164:48.50]Alright.
[164:51.06]We have an update on the commercial flight that went off course earlier.
[164:54.49]The two pilots, Captain Show and another hero we've yet to identify, have brought the plane to a safe landing.
[165:01.49]All passengers are healthy and in good spirits.
[165:04.80]Now, some might call this a miracle, but I'm hearing reports that Captain Show is just that good.
[165:11.22]Tune in tomorrow morning for traffic updates with Don.
[165:14.24]Have a good night.
[165:20.12]What was your first experience like flying a plane?
[165:25.45]Actually, completely honestly, I thought that was going to be way, way, way scarier and way more terrifying and harder.
[165:33.03]Really?
[165:33.56]Yeah.
[165:33.88]So you actually think it's easier?
[165:35.18]No, no, I have 100% not easier.
[165:37.44]Like not easy, but just way less scary.
[165:42.32]So all the tools that the plane has at its disposal, it's almost, I never realized just how much
[165:49.07]Assistance and support there is in the cockpit.
[165:51.06]Yep.
[165:51.50]I always imagined like just two people up here like alright Like the right spot.
[165:56.06]Okay similar to your landing similar to just like yeah.
[165:59.28]Yeah, I mean that is a drama I'm gonna be honest with you.
[166:02.58]What do I get for a grade?
[166:05.05]Jerma that was I've I've flown a few times, huh?
[166:09.81]And that was probably the worst landing I've ever experienced in the cockpit.
[166:13.59]I'm not even joking.
[166:14.73]I
[166:16.16]I'm not even joking.
[166:18.04]Wait a minute.
[166:19.50]I think that was the worst landing.
[166:22.24]Polar vortex.
[166:23.64]Polar vortex.
[166:24.34]Ice crystals all over the plane.
[166:26.32]Winds.
[166:27.02]Turbulent winds blowing in every direction.
[166:30.10]I didn't have a sunny day.
[166:31.66]The sun shining and a perfectly just... I couldn't even see the runway until about 15 seconds before we landed the plane.
[166:37.60]You know what, Jeremy?
[166:38.08]You got a point.
[166:39.40]At the end of the day, we learned a valuable lesson.
[166:42.00]Any landing that you can walk away from is a good one.
[166:46.94]Hey, was that an F?
[166:48.76]You know what?
[166:49.56]It was a C. It was passing.
[166:51.04]Okay, that was a C. Because look, we're still in one piece.
[166:54.35]We're in one piece.
[166:54.89]We're sitting here, we're taxing to the Austin Show Airlines gates.
[166:58.59]Yeah, but I wanted an S, shit.
[167:00.03]Right?
[167:01.35]We're taxiing to the gates.
[167:03.41]Everything is normal.
[167:06.60]We may have done some damage.
[167:08.60]I think people may have had air off the seats.
[167:12.54]We may have done some damage to the aircraft.
[167:16.03]I did try to pull up and save the landing to make it a little softer, but it was too late.
[167:22.29]It was definitely too late.
[167:23.89]Bouncy house.
[167:24.91]Yeah.
[167:26.07]But if I got a C, in brackets, there needs to be like a B, right?
[167:31.20]Because of all the weather.
[167:33.52]There was so much weather.
[167:34.56]You know, I'll be honest.
[167:36.50]You did deal with some really intense weather conditions.
[167:40.46]But the weather seemed to be manageable by the time we got to the approach.
[167:45.11]Let's hear what Dispatch has to say.
[167:46.49]What does Dispatch say?
[167:47.45]Dispatch, how would you rate that last landing?
[168:01.69]I just want to make sure, just in case I need to know, what is the damage to the plane in dollar amounts?
[168:07.87]Boston Air 101 has reported that you've hit 10,000.
[168:10.73]$10,000!
[168:10.75]Oh my gosh!
[168:11.07]We have just raised $10,000 in one stream of flight for the minority pilot.
[168:15.05]And for a safe landing?
[168:16.54]I'll throw $1,000 at them.
[168:29.47]Jerma's going to donate $1,000 for a safe landing.
[168:32.91]Unbelievable.
[168:34.41]Give it up for Jerma, everybody.
[168:36.59]Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation, thank you so much for all the donations you've raised.
[168:41.84]Now over $11,000.
[168:43.18]Jerma's going to throw $1,000 in at his leisure because we'll be raising money through all the four episodes.
[168:48.50]By the way, folks, like I said, Minority Pilot Advancement Foundation helps put people through school, get them the education they need.
[168:57.12]to become an airline pilot, especially those that are underrepresented in the aviation industry.
[169:04.76]Like African-American men and women, as well as women in general, are underrepresented in the airline industry.
[169:12.07]Jerma, we're about to pull in the gate right here.
[169:14.44]I'm going to have you.
[169:15.98]That was, thank you so much for the invite.
[169:20.00]This was like an unbelievable experience.
[169:21.62]It's just like one of the coolest things I've ever done.
[169:23.06]Yeah, you are absolutely welcome.
[169:24.69]Thank you so much for joining me, Jerma.
[169:26.47]I've got to get the damn parking brake off.
[169:28.47]And liabilities for the, what was it, maybe $175,000 in damage to the airplane?
[169:32.53]Well, yeah, why don't you ask the dispatch how much damage we did?
[169:35.77]What's the damage dollar amount?
[169:36.93]Just to make sure I know.
[169:43.30]Nothing that can't be repaired.
[169:44.10]Nothing that can't be repaired.
[169:45.00]I'm trying to get the brakes.
[169:47.18]I'll send you the bill.
[169:49.62]Yes, send the bill.
[169:50.76]He's a jokester, isn't he?
[169:52.16]But honestly though, I'm concerned about the dollar amount.
[169:55.32]Yeah, yeah.
[169:56.08]Alright, flip off that seatbelt sign for me.
[169:58.22]This one here?
[169:59.38]Yep.
[170:00.70]We'll switch to the APU.
[170:02.32]Alright, now power down the engines.
[170:04.14]This one here?
[170:04.73]No, that's the brake.
[170:05.35]That one there?
[170:05.93]Nope, that's the red.
[170:06.75]That's the brake that... This one here?
[170:08.39]Nope, this one right here.
[170:09.39]It's this one right here.
[170:09.99]Alright.
[170:10.51]And I push it down.
[170:11.31]No, you pull very slightly.
[170:12.69]Don't pull too much.
[170:13.41]And then pull it down.
[170:14.17]And I do this to both of them?
[170:15.33]Yep, you do it to both.
[170:16.81]There you go.
[170:21.62]Am I doing it wrong?
[170:22.38]You did it perfectly right.
[170:23.46]Ground power is available.
[170:24.48]You were like, go, man.
[170:25.52]Yeah.
[170:25.98]No, let's... Now let's... You can take your seatbelt off.
[170:29.18]Whew.
[170:30.74]Let's make sure everything's all settled up here.
[170:33.48]Let's shut down the airplane.
[170:38.42]Alright.
[170:39.10]Let's see here.
[170:40.42]Oh, my nerves are up, too.
[170:41.38]That was intense.
[170:41.86]Whoa!
[170:42.00]It's alright.
[170:45.19]The ground crew.
[170:46.35]He did that.
[170:46.81]Ground crew.
[170:47.41]He did that.
[170:47.97]Ground crew was doing it.
[170:49.21]Hey, it's alright.
[170:50.17]We'll go 50-50.
[170:50.69]Yeah, we'll do 50-50.
[170:51.47]Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for watching.
[170:55.72]the first episode of flight.
[170:57.36]I hope you sincerely hope you enjoyed it.
[171:00.50]Um, give it up for Jerma.
[171:02.04]Everybody who did a fantastic job.
[171:04.54]He can't, he can't, he's really trying to keep it cool, but he can't figure out how to get out of his seat.
[171:08.89]I actually don't.
[171:09.57]I actually don't.
[171:10.07]Yeah.
[171:10.25]He does no idea how to get out of his seatbelt.
[171:12.59]Um, I really am.
[171:13.77]Yeah.
[171:14.25]Yeah.
[171:14.67]Give it up for Jerma who did a fantastic job on the first episode of flight.

[171:47.82]I mean, I'm hearing the skies are going to be smoother.
[171:50.68]But you never know when you fly, right?
[171:52.09]You never know.
[171:52.55]Things could happen.
[171:53.23]I'm curious how his landing is going to be.
[171:55.41]We'll have to see.
