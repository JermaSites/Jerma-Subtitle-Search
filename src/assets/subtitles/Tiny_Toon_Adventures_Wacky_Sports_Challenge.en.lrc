[00:01.57]Hi.
[00:06.49]Welcome back.
[00:08.67]To another day, another stream.
[00:16.19]Today, as you know, we're gonna be playing Tiny Toons Wacky Sports.
[00:23.71]One of my favorite Super Nintendo games.
[00:27.39]I probably have as many hours in Tiny Toons Wacky Sports for the course of my life as I do in Team Fortress.
[00:35.98]We're talking thousands of hours from the ages of like 13 to 17.
[00:42.02]This is one of the only games I owned for the Super Nintendo.
[00:50.88]I owned when I was younger.
[00:57.14]Oh no, he referenced it again.
[01:00.78]Tiny.
[01:04.04]Oh, funny.
[01:09.33]What about the Mickey game?
[01:10.49]Yeah, the Mickey game's good too.
[01:11.81]I'm sorry, excuse me.
[01:13.89]The magical quest starring Mickey Mouse.
[01:18.15]He's just in that game.
[01:20.47]It's the magical quest starring Mickey Mouse.
[01:28.02]He better be so fucking good at this game.
[01:29.88]Oh, I'm going to be real good at this game because it's about hitting a button as fast as you can.
[01:37.44]And we all know I've come close to that record.
[01:39.02]Remember when I beat that guy live on stream?
[01:42.69]That guy was like number 10 in the world.
[01:48.79]I became number 9.
[01:49.69]Is this where it all began?
[01:56.41]No, maybe not.
[01:59.04]Here's some, uh, some personal lore for you guys.
[02:02.90]Uh, friends of mine used to hand me the controller when you needed to press a button really fast.
[02:10.75]In Metal Gear Solid 1, there's a point in the game where you have to press the button as fast as possible.
[02:17.55]And it is insanely difficult.
[02:19.79]And, in fact, it could, it could, you... What do I mean, spoilers?
[02:22.83]You have to press a button real fast?
[02:25.69]It could mean anything!
[02:28.51]But I used to get handed the controller.
[02:31.29]Uh, dude, I need you to do this.
[02:33.53]And I'd be like, hold on, don't worry, I got this.
[02:35.11]And I'd crack my knuckles and just go... And then I would give it back.
[02:42.46]Because I'm a one-trick pony.
[02:44.90]I don't have any other tricks.
[02:49.75]If I was a MOBA character, I'd have one move.
[02:52.56]It would be unload entire clip in three seconds.
[02:56.74]And it would just do like 6,000 damage, and then it would be like a two-hour cooldown.
[03:00.74]You'd only be able to use it once a game.
[03:06.17]That's just Tracer.
[03:10.87]I wouldn't even have an auto-attack.
[03:13.89]You just have to I just have to walk around and that one team fight that is really really important Just get me in there and give me the controller and I'll just spam that button But then I need like a fucking two-hour break do it up.
[03:25.23]I'm going to bed You can't walk that's a second move what movement is not a move Anyways, let's play This is a game button.
[03:39.80]It's a minigame game
[03:42.22]Can't say this is gonna be a long stream.
[03:44.46]I'm gonna adhere to what we're supposed to be doing.
[03:48.24]Not 8 hour streams like last night.
[03:50.08]Gonna play this for a little while, see what happens.
[03:58.27]This game fucking sucks.
[03:59.79]You can't just use that when you want to.
[04:03.81]You can't just say this game sucks.
[04:08.95]Alright, here we go.
[04:10.59]I'm looking forward to this.
[04:12.17]Hopefully I have my button spam capabilities ready, because you have- there are so many cases where you have to spam the button.
[04:21.72]I'm probably gonna get exhausted in the first 40 minutes.
[04:24.38]I'm not gonna lie to you.
[04:27.16]Here we go.
[04:28.48]Is everybody ready?
[04:31.02]Oh, I hear the music!

[05:35.65]Ladies and gentlemen, Montana Max's Sports Festival opens grand prize of one million dollars.

[06:43.29]These are all their kids.
[06:47.13]Buster and every- these are all their children.
[06:50.67]Plucky Duck, this is Daffy Duck's son.
[06:52.61]Dizzy Devil, this is Tasmanian Devil's son.
[06:54.72]Babs Bunny, this is... Uh, wait, are they- no, they're not.
[07:02.05]This- this- this- they were supposed to be the new generation of... Here's what happened.
[07:05.75]Let me explain.
[07:07.12]Looney Tunes came out, and then they said, fuck, we need a new generation of cartoon Looney Tunes.
[07:12.26]It's been like 75 years.
[07:14.32]Let's have like young, oh, here's like the new generation.
[07:16.99]Plucky Duck instead of Daffy Duck.
[07:18.91]Dizzy Devil.
[07:20.49]And then they did it again, which you don't know, in the last probably five years, with the Teen Titans.
[07:25.81]Teen Titans are now the Looney Tunes of the current generation.
[07:31.04]That's Robin is Plucky Duck's son.
[07:43.66]What is Mike?
[07:46.84]The games are about to begin.
[07:48.62]Let's go.
[07:49.42]I'm ready to spam.
[07:50.28]I'm ready to fucking spam.
[07:53.48]The first event is Ice Cream Pro at Wacky Land.
[07:56.91]Wait, this is not a spam one.
[07:58.25]Instant loss.
[08:03.46]Throw the ice cream at the targets as they come out.
[08:06.68]If you hit them in a row without missing, you'll get the big points.
[08:12.76]Okay.
[08:16.50]It's throw, throw, ice cream, move.
[08:18.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:20.74]I'm ready.
[08:21.15]I gotta get 250 points to qualify.
[08:22.93]I'm ready.
[08:23.25]And then it goes... The best song.
[08:26.89]Where's the OST for this shit?
[08:34.20]Not this one, I mean... I wanted the X's.
[08:39.75]I just defeat these fucking losers, that's all I... That's all I'm at.
[08:43.57]See?
[08:43.75]What an idiot.
[08:44.09]And I'll fire it!
[09:01.72]Sorry, that's why I scream.
[09:05.16]Oh my god.
[09:05.68]Okay, this is fucking hard.
[09:06.69]I forgot how hard this was.
[09:08.03]I need 250, right?
[09:16.28]Alright, I smoked them all.
[09:17.54]I'm good.
[09:22.06]There we go.
[09:22.38]I just had to get... Look at this.
[09:23.60]Are you kidding me?
[09:24.76]This is like what happens when, like... I'm like a 16-year-old playing in the Little League.
[09:33.24]Like, my parents lied about my age.
[09:37.24]Oh, he has 60 home runs this year?
[09:39.16]Yeah, he's 12.
[09:41.88]Oh.
[09:43.80]Are you sure he's not like 15?
[09:45.94]No.
[09:46.88]That's my son.
[09:47.66]He's good.
[09:53.82]Wow.
[09:54.30]Zero points.
[09:55.06]Bad.
[10:01.11]Come on.
[10:01.41]It's like... Usually I'm the one over there in that next ranking.
[10:08.41]You know what I mean?
[10:08.95]Usually I have to look at the guy next to me that has a thousand points.
[10:11.43]Not this time.
[10:19.64]I think this is, if I remember, this is like Mario Party, where they give out points at the end for like how many times you got hit in the head or something.
[10:28.21]Oh, I think I know what this one is.
[10:29.94]Imagine a game where they launched you at a cliff and you had to stop.
[11:00.48]Here we go.
[11:28.12]Alright.
[11:28.64]Stop!
[11:28.90]Okay, be cautious this time.
[11:34.66]Second try.
[11:35.42]Okay.
[11:36.12]It's 250 to qualify.
[11:37.60]I have to get 250.
[11:38.56]Maybe I should- I'm not gonna go that fast.
[11:48.30]That was the problem.
[11:48.82]I went into red.
[11:57.97]How did I actually attack 290?
[11:58.69]I'm good.
[11:59.15]I'm good.
[12:11.88]Chicken Dash.
[12:13.56]290.
[12:15.28]Speed bonus.
[12:16.38]Boopy Prize.
[12:22.00]Okay, wait.
[12:22.78]Buster's getting up kind of quick.
[12:24.04]I don't like where he is.
[12:26.69]Third event is weightlifting at the TV station.
[12:29.47]Good luck.
[12:30.53]Alright, I gotta listen up for this one.
[12:35.21]It's all about spamming that power game.
[12:37.41]Lift the barrel before the others.
[12:38.61]You make three lifts, you get the top points.
[12:42.75]If you're too slow, you're out of the competition.
[12:44.74]Save up a lot of strength or you'll drop the barbell.
[12:49.22]Yeah, you just have to power.
[12:50.96]Just lift.
[12:51.44]Okay, I'm ready.
[12:58.21]It's not about getting the little ones.
[12:59.37]It's about getting one huge one.
[13:00.73]Here we go.
[13:21.50]Fuck outta here, I win.
[13:27.96]Oh, hand me the controller, Jerby!
[13:29.02]Look at how fucking huge- that's- that's how huge I am.
[13:34.82]But he's just a Hulk.
[13:39.82]110?
[13:39.84]Oh wow, Buster failed.
[13:42.62]Buster couldn't even do it.
[13:53.79]750 subs.
[13:54.77]Wait, what?
[13:55.41]Do we have to do it twice?
[13:59.43]Okay, well it doesn't even matter.
[14:00.37]I destroyed it.
[14:01.59]Let me see if I can get it in one go.
[14:07.94]Shit Don't matter you got to get it right on that needle Buster didn't even try
[14:41.91]Can we do it again?
[14:42.75]Should I just not even pick it up?
[14:46.12]I've already qualified for the playoffs.
[14:48.20]Oh, it's just me and her.
[14:48.96]I just threw that thing into the ceiling.
[15:11.84]That's guaranteed that I win.
[15:16.96]Oh my god.
[15:17.76]No, just challenge.
[15:18.22]What do you mean challenge?
[15:20.84]My arms are already tired.
[15:21.80]How did I do this when I was a kid for like fucking six straight hours?
[15:38.72]Ah!
[15:42.94]Dude, how did I do this when I was a kid?
[15:44.38]How?
[15:47.40]My arms, I already need to be like, I need to be relieved already.
[16:00.56]Ratchet out.
[16:03.99]Okay, I've won.
[16:05.19]I don't... Okay, I'm gonna just... I did so well in the first few competitions that... Saucer throw.
[16:12.09]Okay, then I can just literally throw this one to the ground and I just still win.
[16:20.29]Power gauge and go around in a circle.
[16:21.75]Decide the angle and let it go.
[16:23.97]Don't throw it out of bounds.
[16:28.21]Go to the bathroom.
[16:29.29]I'm good.
[16:30.53]Alright, they have all... 321.
[16:35.46]Here we go.
[16:35.84]How much time do I have?
[16:39.16]There we go!
[16:59.67]That's not coming back.
[17:01.15]That thing's gonna get picked up by gravity.
[17:16.12]Okay, I don't want it second try.
[17:17.78]Oh my god.
[17:21.08]Why did I think I still had a 14 year old body?
[17:24.79]I was like growing up.
[17:25.97]I was growing.
[17:26.53]My bones were strong.
[17:27.51]I was drinking milk every day.
[17:30.32]I was like 15, I was strong!
[17:33.61]16, I can pick up a fucking car!
[17:36.15]Sorry.
[17:38.53]Midlife crisis?
[17:57.46]No, there's no such thing as... There's no such thing as a midlife crisis for me.
[18:06.65]Alright, I'm... This is...
[18:14.49]I win.
[18:15.36]Fifth event is Obstacle Course at Acme Acres.
[18:18.44]Good luck, everyone.
[18:20.38]Thing is, though, I have to destroy this because... It keeps getting up.
[18:25.18]It keeps ramping up in difficulty.
[18:28.22]And the events change to be way harder.
[18:31.93]Okay.
[18:32.67]Run, collect as many items as you can.
[18:35.19]Pump your opponents.
[18:36.01]Avoid Elmira.
[18:38.89]Hits by jumping.
[18:39.69]Oh, fuck.
[18:40.41]How do you jump?
[18:41.47]Wait, how do I control it?
[18:44.23]How do you control?
[18:45.27]Just run?
[18:46.31]I don't, I don't understand.
[18:55.18]How do you, I don't know how you run.
[19:13.29]Why do I keep falling back?
[19:16.81]Is it A?
[19:27.64]Why do I keep falling backwards?
[19:30.16]Why do I have to press?
[19:32.04]It's X. It's fucking X. Okay.

[20:09.10]That's all I care about.
[20:13.18]I have to beat this fat guy.
[20:16.00]Did I win?
[20:16.90]Oh.
[20:17.86]I can't brah.
[20:18.59]Whatever.
[20:18.91]It's okay.
[20:29.93]It don't matter.
[20:30.79]I can cheer it.
[20:31.53]I didn't get a jump bonus?
[20:36.97]Trip bonus.
[20:40.83]Oh, I fell down the most times.
[20:44.58]Okay, Buster.
[20:45.20]Buster, you can't even sniff my score.
[20:48.34]That's how far away I am.

[22:03.69]Wait, can I do it?
[22:07.83]Wait, I'm trying to land it.
[22:20.73]Cut it!
[22:21.15]Cut it!
[22:22.37]Cut the wheel!
[22:34.78]Why didn't I take the parachute out?
[22:39.04]Why wouldn't I take the... Wait, was I just going to... I would just die.
[22:49.85]What was I expecting to happen there?
[22:52.67]Smash into his ceiling and instantly die?
[22:58.67]I gotta figure, I mean, I don't... What would have happened?
[23:02.52]It's not like... He lost because he lived.
[23:15.42]Alright, number one.
[23:16.66]Made it.
[23:20.43]Izzy doesn't even get a place on the board, though.
[23:26.05]Password!
[23:27.91]Okay, someone remember that.
[23:28.79]Write that down.
[23:31.13]It's, um... Wile E. Coyote Jr., Road Runner Jr., and Montana Max.
[23:38.68]Alright, someone remember that.
[23:42.50]Here we go.
[23:46.16]Next, try the normal course.
[23:48.02]Do your best.
[23:50.12]We keep upgrading.
[23:51.46]The first event is Ski Race.
[23:54.02]Let's do our best.
[23:54.98]It's just move and jump.
[23:59.47]That's it.
[24:18.66]Hey, nothing else.
[24:19.12]Just move around and just collect flags.
[24:20.80]Get out of here.
[24:33.82]Don't fall off the edge.
[24:37.95]Minus 30 points, but what?
[24:39.89]Alright, now be conservative with this one.
[24:42.85]I'm destroying them.
[24:43.52]Dude, I'm fucking liking this song.
[24:55.90]Put your hand down.
[24:58.32]I can't!
[24:58.60]I can't fucking put my hand down.
[25:01.79]Oh wow, I just destroyed her.
[25:15.45]This is a generic bass line.
[25:18.97]Yeah, I mean it's... It is because you can always tell when there's a really generic bass line when the bass guitar is just counting to seven.
[25:32.30]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[25:34.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[26:03.60]I remember the log-cutting one.
[26:05.30]It was just a wood-cutting composition, eventually, and it... It always fucked me up, and I always got so angry.
[26:11.33]Oh my god, I... Maybe, like, a thousand points.
[26:22.44]Pick up a fucking flag, man.
[26:25.26]What the fuck?
[26:25.86]I want 500 points.
[26:27.92]500 points or I'm gonna uninstall game.
[26:31.25]It's not like on Steam.
[26:32.76]I'm gonna get a Steam refund.
[26:36.66]Come on, speed it up a little bit.
[26:38.88]Let's get that baseline.
[26:40.90]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[27:03.56]You can count to eight.
[27:05.30]Am I?
[27:07.34]What does the booby bonus mean?
[27:10.66]Booby prize.
[27:11.74]No one gets it.
[27:15.23]What is it?
[27:22.13]Chicken race.
[27:22.99]Oh, no.
[27:25.33]Okay.
[27:26.93]This one's 300 to qualify.
[27:30.95]This is the run killer.
[27:37.35]Yep, this is the run killer.
[27:38.31]I need 300.
[27:38.69]Oh yeah, we got it.
[27:39.89]Nice.
[28:07.06]So the max is 400.
[28:09.94]Hey, super frog.
[28:11.62]Thank you Burnout for that.
[28:12.64]I don't know why I even said that.
[28:15.14]I'm so used to just doing that.
[28:16.30]Thanks for the five community subs, Burnout.
[28:18.38]I don't know why I did that.
[28:23.98]Thank you Burnout for the five subs.
[28:34.80]350, good.
[28:36.98]That's not super brutal though.
[28:42.19]0 and 0, poor Dizzy.

[53:09.83]swimming race I don't remember this one at all swim skillfully and grab as many items as you can be careful or you'll run out of breath you won't be able to swim and catch the big air bubbles you can get a whole breath of air while still underwater

[53:50.53]Oh my god, why are you guys not getting the points?
[53:58.01]Buster is dying.
[53:59.13]Did you actually get hit by the shark on the bottom of the screen?
[54:12.52]Give me that ammo.
[54:21.14]Pearl?
[54:22.18]Too much water!
[54:27.75]Oh my god, I'm winning by so much, it's not even who cares.
[54:37.14]Holy shit, you dropped everything!
[54:40.95]I was downwind.
[54:42.23]It was perfect.
[54:43.43]I'm going to have all the points.
[54:45.11]I'm going to win by a landslide.
[54:46.89]What am I trying?
[54:52.97]Did I lose everything?
[54:55.01]What happened?
[54:56.81]I drowned.
[54:58.31]Wait.
[54:59.27]I had like 500 points.
[55:00.41]What?
[55:08.32]Get it all.
[55:09.27]Pick it all up.
[55:10.33]Who's cat even has anything left?
[55:20.79]I drowned again.
[55:22.48]How do you drown twice?
[55:26.66]Breathe.
[55:27.48]Breathe, Bucky.
[55:30.80]Go for air, quick.
[55:32.36]Bucky, you need air.
[55:45.06]Okay, I don't think any of us won.
[55:47.93]I mean, I had the most points, but who fucking cares?
[55:54.07]It's 300?
[56:02.01]It's 400.
[56:05.55]What happens if nobody wins?
[56:07.97]Speed bonus?
[56:10.06]Iron Man bonus?
[56:12.11]Boggart bonus?
[56:15.14]No.
[56:15.38]Okay, let's do this again.
[56:25.69]Why won't you say booby prize?
[56:26.83]Because no one ever gets it.
[56:27.63]It's at zero every time.
[56:33.97]Alright.
[56:35.15]So here's the plan.
[56:36.32]The plan is...
[56:38.83]They're going to die multiple times.
[56:40.91]Just be there to get the scraps when they come back.
[56:44.31]Because it dumps out of their body.
[56:46.55]So just stay alive and just sit at the bottom like a fucking lobster.
[56:53.74]BC algae.
[56:56.36]I mean, if they're going to be idiots, then... They're going to be fucking idiots.
[57:07.07]400, right?
[57:12.15]See?
[57:12.51]See?
[57:12.89]Alright, just stay back.
[57:21.12]Get these.
[57:23.86]And now stay back.
[57:24.64]I don't have any points to lose.
[57:29.26]How am I supposed to get money from them if they don't have any money?
[57:34.00]I have all the money.
[57:37.90]I have to lose.
[57:40.84]So then I can collect my own money.
[57:50.27]I have everything.
[57:51.53]I own everything.
[57:55.77]I have... I own everything.
[57:57.44]Okay, now I don't.
[57:59.40]Give it to me.
[57:59.84]Give me, give me that.
[58:02.16]Give me that money.
[58:10.52]Get it out.
[58:15.57]I want them all at zero.
[58:21.69]Wait!
[58:27.39]Fucking come on!
[58:30.17]All those points get deleted!
[58:32.85]They get deleted!
[58:34.55]That's not how it works!
[58:36.92]Holy shit!
[58:40.64]I still win.
[58:41.20]Okay, don't get hit by anything.
[58:47.12]What?
[58:47.38]If you lose... If you get caught by the... If you die, somebody just burns all your money in a backyard?
[58:52.27]That doesn't make any sense.
[58:57.57]I win.
[58:57.77]Good.
[59:06.39]I'm gonna be honest with you.
[59:07.09]Uh, the blue numbers, that's like air, water.
[59:11.23]That's not a point number.
[59:12.56]Yellow, red, orange, point number.
[59:16.42]Like, that's an oxygen number.
[59:17.68]You know what I mean?
[59:19.36]Like, the blue is an oxygen number for me.
[59:28.77]She's right.
[59:31.69]Thank you, one person.
[59:33.25]That apparently doesn't think I'm insane for saying that.
[59:36.13]Thank you one person for agreeing that the color blue is synonymous with water.
[59:41.17]Just thank you for agreeing with that.
[59:42.39]Apparently we have a bunch of people that think water is orange.
[59:46.15]Alright, sausage roll.
[59:47.29]Use the power gauge.
[59:58.04]Okay, 350.
[59:58.68]It's gotta be good.
[59:59.82]This is gonna be real good.
[60:02.08]Do a Taz impression now.
[60:03.20]No.
[60:05.80]What is the color?
[60:07.72]What is the color that I say it is?
[60:10.44]Water?
[60:10.88]Wait, what?
[60:11.32]Hold on.
[60:11.80]I gotta pay attention.
[60:13.67]Now that's gonna be damn good.
[60:17.47]It's right on target, straight ahead.
[60:21.69]Good angle, too.
[60:32.76]Damn That couldn't have been much better 30-50 though, I'm good I don't care if I have second place I'm going for overall, not one event
[61:06.73]Look at that high angle, too.
[61:07.83]Tons of power.
