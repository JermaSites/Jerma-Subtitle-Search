[00:00.94]Did that just crash?
[00:07.21]Hello?
[00:07.91]Um...
[00:31.37]Hello?
[00:33.45]Well done.
[00:36.67]Am I in your game?
[00:38.37]Yes.
[00:40.09]Are you a pirate man?
[00:43.53]How come there's no music?
[00:44.91]I don't know.
[00:47.33]I want to be like a pirate ogre.
[00:50.01]Okay, really, there's no sound in my game.
[00:56.68]Leave and come back.
[01:00.36]I might have messed something up too.
[01:01.68]Hold on.
[01:21.11]I need two more Books of Magic, then I can play with the Battlemage.
[01:25.81]I need a blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I wanna play with the Battlemage.
[01:31.08]I keep letting you take all the books.
[01:36.42]Good!
[01:43.96]Okay, Dremel wants to let everyone know first, before we get started, that he has to leave in ten minutes.
[01:49.95]So we only have ten minutes to beat a run.
[01:51.87]Ten minutes.
[01:52.49]Uh, invite me.
[01:54.45]Ten minutes, yeah.
[01:55.51]Yeah, once ten minutes are up, he's outta here.
[01:58.42]We have to get this in quick.
[02:00.86]There's an achievement to beat this game in less than 30 minutes, so it's possible.
[02:05.95]That's still more than 10 minutes.
[02:10.89]Well, you can go fuck yourself.
[02:13.31]That was really mean.
[02:20.09]Wonk Ronnie gave me $10 because I came back.
[02:22.71]That's why I came back.
[02:23.63]I'm ending the stream now.
[02:25.95]Later.
[02:26.37]Later.
[02:29.93]awful of a person would you have to be?
[02:31.99]Well, you are a pretty awful person, so... You.
[02:35.36]I suppose.
[02:36.10]I have to... Hold on.
[02:37.54]Move a few things around on my other monitor.
[02:39.00]Why don't I do this before I start streams?
[02:41.10]I don't know.
[02:41.56]I don't know.
[02:42.08]You always, like, start a stream, and then you're like, hold on, give me, like, 40 minutes while I make sure I set up my stream.
[02:47.82]I do do that.
[02:48.82]Come on!
[02:52.46]You see how angry my guy is?
[02:54.86]He's ready to unload on you.
[02:57.42]I don't.
[03:00.14]Ow, that was very bloody.
[03:07.06]Okay, I think... No, I'm pumping up that music.
[03:11.70]We're jamming.
[03:12.68]I'm ready.
[03:13.52]Yeah, I could be a pirate too.
[03:14.36]Do you want to both be pirates?
[03:17.18]Probably a bad idea.
[03:19.97]Probably.
[03:21.69]I want to be a barbarian man then.
[03:24.15]Okay.
[03:24.97]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:25.91]Before we go any further.
[03:26.99]Yeah?
[03:27.85]You hate barbarian men.
[03:29.84]Why?
[03:31.27]You've, like, said, like, I don't like Barbarian, so just remember you said those words.
[03:35.83]No, I looked back at his stats, and he has extra strength, so he hits people harder.
[03:40.61]I thought he, like, just had a sword.
[03:42.19]That breaks shields, yeah.
[03:45.17]That does break shields, that's cool.
[03:53.65]I think it's been ten minutes.
[03:55.80]Oh, see ya, gotta go.
[03:59.97]Dude, what are you talking about?
[04:00.69]Perfect Man, he's a good man.
[04:04.87]So the pirate attacks people too, right?
[04:07.57]Yeah, I forget why.
[04:08.57]Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.
[04:11.25]You fully heal when you're drunk and you always have rum.
[04:14.01]Well done.
[04:16.93]That's the other thing about pirate.
[04:18.81]When you're drunk, you heal yourself.
[04:21.25]You, like, slowly regenerate or something.
[04:23.37]Oh, cool.
[04:24.95]So, like, it's good for you to be drunk.
[04:26.47]Have fun with that.
[04:27.19]Okay.
[04:34.41]How's everyone doing?
[04:35.56]If you don't know what this game is, leave now.
[04:37.96]You're not a very nice guy, are you?
[04:47.90]There's no streamer that's just a bad person.
[04:52.19]I feel like sometimes I have to fill that niche.
[04:57.88]um whatever you say how many does he want 10 really you take that every time let me guess you're gonna get the spell books too gold of course I have the gold you can do it too can't you no what one use and then it's over same thing like with the cards with the the devil it's it's one and go I can't see because your pirate hat your parrot
[05:29.98]Yeah, you take that.
[05:30.68]I have rum.
[05:32.58]I don't want it.
[05:33.46]Oh yeah, you can't even drop the rum.
[05:35.32]No.
[05:37.44]So I'm only allowed to have rum.
[05:41.68]Yeah, you can only have rum.
[05:44.05]And the rum heals you while you're drunk.
[05:46.21]Cool.
[05:50.73]Whoops.
[05:53.47]Okay.
[05:54.99]That kind of sucks that only one of us can actually hold a healing thing, but I guess you don't need it.
[05:59.24]Yeah, I don't need it.
[06:00.70]Is your cannon actually good?
[06:02.24]You got a good cannon there?
[06:04.96]I don't think it does a whole lot of damage.
[06:06.44]I think it just does probably the same as if you were doing a dash tech.
[06:11.50]Oh, you get a free item for destroying all these.
[06:13.30]And I think that you don't have the achievement.
[06:17.44]Thanks everyone for resubbing, but I mean, that's kind of too nice.
[06:24.07]I actually don't like, um, the cannon that much.
[06:27.01]It makes you too vulnerable.
[06:28.07]You just have to stand still for, like, three straight seconds.
[06:30.73]Don't you have to do that with the dash?
[06:33.17]Yeah, but you move with the dash.
[06:34.35]You don't move with the cannon.
[06:35.83]See, like, I just, like, stand still.
[06:37.69]I would have already been, like, across the screen.
[06:38.99]If somebody was behind me, I'd be in trouble.
[06:41.35]I guess.
[06:41.67]You just get a wall behind you.
[06:45.55]I can't pick that up.
[06:46.85]I would drink it or take it or whatever.
[06:48.65]It's a fun game to watch.
[06:49.45]I agree, this game probably is, like, awesome to watch, because it has a lot of the same random stuff as, uh, like, Isaac would have.
[06:55.55]You have to destroy all these.
[07:00.41]I like this game a lot.
[07:02.15]Like, surprisingly, a lot.
[07:04.28]Hmm, do you now?
[07:05.46]Hmm.
[07:07.22]It's pretty good for a shitty iPad game.
[07:09.18]Yeah, I mean, what did you say, specifically, when I told you to check out this game?
[07:14.06]Oh, wait, wait, I'm gonna take the Thief's Mask.
[07:17.38]And you can get the armor because I can't wear it.
[07:19.86]Yep.
[07:21.17]That's immunity to fire.
[07:22.15]Yeah.
[07:24.15]There's so many health potions.
[07:26.91]Mmm, yeah.
[07:27.27]This game is really fun, Highstar.
[07:29.57]Oh, hmm, hmm.
[07:31.66]Are you gonna make me play a shitty iPad game?
[07:36.86]Dude, look at this game right now and tell me it doesn't look like a shit game.
[07:42.34]I thought it looked good.
[07:47.76]Well, you're wrong.
[07:51.09]Both have 411.
[07:52.05]4-11.
[07:58.86]Let me get most of the gold, because I have the thief mask.
[08:02.18]Yes.
[08:10.80]I wonder if your pirate's going to attack those.
[08:12.70]I keep calling him your pirate.
[08:16.04]Your parrot.
[08:16.63]Are you drunk right now, dude?
[08:17.99]You drunk right now?
[08:19.51]How does the parrot attack people?
[08:22.73]He just said murder time.
[08:23.75]I think there is a reason why he attacks.
[08:27.91]Do I have to be drunk for him to attack?
[08:29.98]I don't remember.
[08:30.66]I don't know.
[08:31.50]I was reading through it earlier.
[08:35.15]Cannon's probably really good for these giant guys.
[08:37.35]Yeah, it does a lot.
[08:39.43]I don't know what you're talking about, that not doing a lot of damage.
[08:43.24]Well, it does 22, 23, same as it normally would.
[08:45.88]Each hit.
[08:46.56]Oh, it does three hits.
[08:50.15]You just don't appreciate anything.
[08:53.95]Cannon away.
[08:54.63]Okay.
[08:56.69]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[08:57.73]I should have brought the health potion, so the curie.
[09:00.81]The cure-all.
[09:03.81]The pirate is also a pirate?
[09:05.21]I guess that's true.
[09:06.68]Get your ass kicked, dude.
[09:18.08]Nice work, haha.
[09:19.22]Nice work, haha.
[09:21.14]I had my chat open twice.
[09:27.75]You do this.
[09:28.21]I'm gonna close the other chat.
[09:36.39]Poisonous.
[09:39.61]You got a poison blade?
[09:41.32]Hey look, what's that?
[09:42.40]Book of Spells.
[09:44.92]Oh, you fucking cheater.
[09:45.96]At least I got the health.
[09:50.62]Get the, uh, the big guy thing.
[09:52.86]Well, the cure.
[09:54.36]If you wanna, like, cure your drunkenness you could take that, I guess.
[09:59.37]No, you can't.
[10:00.43]Never mind.
[10:01.73]Well, let's leave that there.
[10:02.59]Let's go.
[10:09.46]I was afraid to shoot.
[10:10.98]Whoops.
[10:12.70]Yeah, I... It looked like we both wanted to pick it up and we both tried.
[10:18.12]Yeah, that was very odd.
[10:19.28]I'm taking way too much damage for this early.
[10:35.26]Oh.
[10:37.72]I'm gonna drink this and cure it.
[10:42.74]We're good.
[10:43.68]We good.
[10:44.34]We good.
[10:45.02]I think you being a pirate is really helpful.
[10:46.77]Just because you don't use all the healing stuff and I can use it all.
[10:50.05]I'm a barbarian, man.
[10:51.75]Yeah.
[10:53.15]That's why you shouldn't have also been a pirate.
[10:55.05]Because none of us would have been able to take any items.
[10:57.49]Yeah.
[11:01.09]You should be breaking up on most of these crates if you're Mr. Money Man.
[11:05.27]Mr. Money Bags?
[11:06.05]I already did it.
[11:06.99]I already did it.
[11:09.36]Let's go up to the shop, up to the brewery.
[11:14.18]What's this week's tavern brawl?
[11:15.88]Okay, if you do get the devil card, I was playing again, yes, you get a curse.
[11:19.94]That's why you might want to stop.
[11:22.56]And why this might suck.
[11:23.64]Because the curses are really, really brutal.
[11:25.63]I had a curse earlier that was...
[11:28.84]You always take one damage, it's one damage, one damage, one damage.
[11:31.93]But every time you hit someone you get health and you attack faster, but it was not worth it.
[11:35.27]So yeah, good luck with this.
[11:37.99]That's really good.
[11:39.95]You're fucked.
[11:40.33]Curse beggar.
[11:41.49]Oh, I can't pick up gold.
[11:42.29]I haven't seen these dragons.
[11:45.83]So it is bad.
[11:48.81]Well.
[11:50.87]Stealing my item.
[11:52.83]Dude, these guys have a lot of health.
[11:56.69]I'm gonna die and you have him.
[12:06.68]I guess the enemies are harder because you did the card game really bad.
[12:13.06]That's what I'm gonna guess.
[12:15.86]Oh, dude.
[12:17.32]Actually, can I just fill this back?
[12:19.06]Do I always have rum?
[12:20.18]Yeah, you always have rum.
[12:24.06]No, I don't.
[12:26.74]What do you mean?
[12:27.70]It's not there anymore.
[12:28.80]Does it recharge or something?
[12:31.02]I guess, because it said you can't get rid of your rum.
[12:35.44]It's gone.
[12:36.69]Alright, well, whatever.
[12:38.83]Dude, that's interesting.
[12:44.62]We'll figure it all out.
[12:51.80]This music's getting me jazzed up.
[13:00.63]So when are we gonna do the co-op speedruns?
[13:04.80]Umm... What's a nice way to say never?
[13:07.44]Uh, I think he just said it.
[13:22.99]I thought I was gonna hit you there.
[13:25.35]All that armor's yours, so let me get the... Well, you have the spell power already.
[13:28.59]Like, you already fucking, like, stole the spell power.
[13:32.31]So I guess you get everything.
[13:35.47]Have fun with everything.
[13:37.19]Thanks.
[13:40.23]The short sword's not that good, so... Yeah.
[13:45.36]Well... Maybe for you.
[13:49.16]I mean... This weapon is huge range, but it does, like, no damage.
[13:55.14]I think I'm cool with that.
[13:56.04]I'm gonna... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:57.32]Did we leave something on the ground?
[13:58.33]No, that was one of the bubbles coming off your head.
[14:00.13]Okay.
[14:00.27]Okay.
[14:08.04]Dude, we cool.
[14:09.28]We good.
[14:09.62]Because I can just stand here and swing and no one can touch me.
[14:24.64]How long can you hold people like that for?
[14:26.76]Up in the air?
[14:27.76]Yeah.
[14:28.82]I think forever.
[14:29.54]I don't think you ever drop them.
[14:31.22]They don't get out of it or run away or anything?
[14:33.12]They don't, no.
[14:33.72]I've never seen them pop out of your hands.
[14:35.21]Okay.
[14:39.07]I've carried some people pretty far to try and drop them in caves and stuff.
[14:47.85]You were just hammering the shit out of me.
[14:51.11]That's what I'm here for.
[14:52.05]I'm a barbarian, dude.
[14:53.03]Can you not?
[14:55.55]Can you please?
[14:57.43]No, Ms.
[14:57.81]Pauling said I'm doing good.
[15:00.27]What does Ms.
[15:00.63]Pauling say to you?
[15:02.18]Nice work.
[15:05.80]I love that sub sound.
[15:09.26]Oh, soft boys.
[15:10.90]Do you know that soft boys love watching me?
[15:15.34]I did not.
[15:16.34]No, you do.
[15:19.20]We're in the dark castle.
[15:23.31]Remember not to pick up money.
[15:24.21]You can't even do it.
[15:25.43]I know, but it sometimes just grabs you.
[15:27.59]Because it lands right on top of you.
[15:29.77]Here's the teleport thing.
[15:31.15]You might want that.
[15:32.55]I do.
[15:32.93]I like that a lot.
[15:36.25]You know how you're complaining about coins dropping on top of you?
[15:39.93]Maybe you shouldn't be the one to break all the barrels then.
[15:42.99]Well, I have obsessive compulsive disorder.
[15:45.80]I have to break them, sorry.
[15:49.22]I guess I can't really argue.
[15:50.24]I'm a very obsessive person.
[15:52.00]Is that rum being drunk awesome for you, by the way?
[15:55.27]You seem like you're never hurt.
[15:57.71]I have the armor on.
[15:59.21]Oh, that too.
[16:07.15]See, I didn't even move.
[16:08.55]If I had moved, I would have picked up some of that.
[16:11.79]Okay, I just picked up that.
[16:13.01]I picked it up.
[16:14.57]I have that now.
[16:16.31]Yeah, I don't think you're supposed to be able to do that.
[16:18.65]I thought, like, Pirate was supposed to always have the room.
[16:23.22]I don't know.
[16:25.54]Damn it.
[16:25.80]I'm sorry.
[16:27.54]It's just compulsive.
[16:28.96]It's on the ground.
[16:29.98]I have to get it.
[16:36.62]Yeah, I can pick up all this stuff.
[16:39.25]Yeah, alright.
[16:39.65]Well, whatever.
[16:41.61]Maybe it's just for that first time?
[16:44.09]I don't know.
[16:45.77]I'm gonna teleport.
[16:46.53]You dare me?
[16:48.05]I don't dare you.
[16:48.87]It actually worked.
[16:53.17]Nice work!
[16:54.55]Thank you, Ms.
[16:55.33]Falling!
[16:56.91]It's always so well-timed!
[17:00.31]Yeah, don't stand in front of me.
[17:02.09]I'm gonna be doing that.
[17:05.32]Well, you can.
[17:06.10]It's over now.
[17:10.14]I love you.
[17:16.42]Not you.
[17:19.02]But you know.
[17:19.94]Okay, this looks awful.
[17:22.83]By the way.
[17:30.29]Focus belts.
[17:33.27]And what do you know?
[17:34.27]Guess what I get to play with now.
[17:35.55]Turns you into a Berserker.
[17:38.31]Damage is doubled, health is halved.
[17:41.19]Do I want that?
[17:44.39]Yes.
[17:45.17]Critical damage plus 100%, by the way, on this axe.
[17:47.29]I'm gonna take that, and then I'm gonna get the plus max health.
[17:51.39]And get the... This thing does 100% more crit.
[17:54.56]Like, 100% crit damage.
[17:57.50]You would be crazy not to pick that up as well.
[17:59.10]I have 5% crit.
[18:01.16]That's 100% crit damage.
[18:02.28]You just took a thing that made you do more damage.
[18:04.31]That's more damage.
[18:05.21]Take it up.
[18:06.17]No!
[18:06.47]Can you leave me alone?
[18:10.09]Do you understand how this game is played?
[18:13.55]Have fun.
[18:16.03]Oh, great.
[18:16.53]I don't have a double jump either.
[18:21.78]I was gonna hit you.
[18:23.00]That would've been really bad.
[18:25.64]I keep picking up the fucking coins, you loser.
[18:28.18]Mm-hmm.
[18:36.64]Haha.
[18:47.19]Oh, you think that's so funny?
[18:48.03]Coin.
[18:50.71]I have 180 coins.
[18:51.97]And actually, look, the achievement is for 1,000 coins.
[18:55.75]You even had to keep going.
[18:56.79]Did that not hurt you?
[18:57.55]Or no, are you still healing it because you're drunk?
[19:00.22]I don't even... No.
[19:11.02]Alright.
[19:14.24]Tiny room.
[19:18.36]Those cannons actually don't knock me down.
[19:20.10]It doesn't look like.
[19:21.76]They just... Oh my goodness gracious goodness.
[19:25.34]I was running to get this guy's head.
[19:26.58]That was scary.
[19:33.27]Even if I take a curse thing, it won't take off the money curse?
[19:36.33]No.
[19:38.49]That's unfortunate.
[19:41.56]Yeah, I can take, that's very strange.
[19:43.73]Maybe that's like a bug or something.
[19:48.77]We're just gonna have to read the class again and figure out pirate.
[19:53.82]It's the first time playing pirate, man.
[19:55.60]Leave us alone.
[20:13.80]I, um... For a weapon with five attack, I'm doing a lot of damage.
[20:18.91]You know what I mean?
[20:21.45]I don't think you do know what I mean.
[20:23.61]Can you just get the thing?
[20:25.51]Yeah, I did just get the thing.
[20:26.53]That's my point.
[20:27.17]You got the thing, it gives you more damage, yeah.
[20:28.63]So, come on, what are you talking about?
[20:30.49]That's the curse removal again.
[20:44.11]I'm just gonna, let's just, for fun.
[20:45.88]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:48.48]You fucking idiot.
[20:50.18]What?
[20:51.64]You have the thing that heals and gives you a disease, and the thing that cures curses, and I'm hurt over here, and I'm just kind of wishing I had something that healed me.
[20:58.71]And some way to cure the curse.
[21:00.37]But you know, you just wanted to drink it for no reason.
[21:03.73]I just wanted to drink it because I wanted to get rid of the... That's cool, I'm buying the fucking, like, Doom Sword.
[21:09.65]I forgot what this does, and I had to buy it before you got it.
[21:13.33]13 damage for every active curse or disease.
[21:14.77]I have zero gold, by the way.
[21:16.57]Yeah.
[21:16.81]Do you want the sword, actually?
[21:17.65]Do you have any curses?
[21:19.57]Oh, yeah, you have the curse, so you take that.
[21:21.07]I do have the curse.
[21:23.71]And that's spell damage.
[21:24.77]It gives random curse.
[21:26.55]I wish I could buy that for you.
[21:28.93]But I'm pretty sure once you buy that, I use it.
[21:33.15]What does it say?
[21:33.83]Okay, it is.
[21:34.85]And I can't buy that for you, either.
[21:39.26]Oh, that's too bad.
[21:40.48]I could use those pizza spots.
[21:41.44]Oh yeah, you holding the sword and the sword is red.
[21:43.20]A little bit.
[21:45.22]Yeah, that's cool.
[21:49.55]I don't want a random curse.
[21:50.77]I want to win this game.
[21:53.69]So let's not do the unnecessary things.
[21:56.19]Okay.
[21:56.69]That was a really shitty shot.
[21:59.88]It wasn't.
[22:00.48]It's just shitty that you can't actually buy them.
[22:04.28]Or I can't buy it and just have you pick it up.
[22:08.44]Well, maybe that's why they wanted to make it so it's very punishing if you actually get this curse thing.
[22:14.70]The rocks do drop.
[22:15.98]It's not terrible.
[22:23.11]You picking up the rocks?
[22:27.09]Well, I haven't been picking up very much gold, so no.
[22:34.53]This pirate is fucking annoying.
[22:37.91]His chat bubble fills up the screen.
[22:40.23]Yeah, he kind of sucks.
[22:43.87]Let's go.
[22:52.58]How much damage are you doing?
[22:53.42]30 to 40.
[22:57.00]Oh yeah, I can see how much you do.
[22:58.53]35, 30.
[23:07.02]Am I the Hamburglar?
[23:07.90]The fucking lumberjack burglar.
[23:11.66]You're the Hamburglar that lived a much healthier lifestyle.
[23:15.20]He stopped stealing hamburgers and was like, you know what?
[23:17.74]He stopped stealing hamburgers, went on like a strict protein diet and started lifting.
[23:32.16]He probably still can eat the burgers, but...
[23:37.33]Ow.
[23:43.69]I'm taking, uh, the Klee gain.
[23:53.86]Blocks all hits, immune to poison.
[23:55.84]Sure.
[23:58.52]What was that?
[24:00.00]Blocks all hits and I'm immune to poison.
[24:02.76]I... Do you want the mini-demon?
[24:04.54]I, like, hate that that shoots...
[24:08.13]You take it.
[24:09.09]I mean, I've already got an annoying familiar walking around.
[24:11.17]Might as well make it two.
[24:12.79]Yeah.
[24:15.55]Alright.
[24:20.83]I hope I hit for a zillion damage now.
[24:25.52]Oh, bomb guys.
[24:29.38]Later, bomb guy.
[24:32.56]I'd be careful.
[24:34.34]Trying to knock him off.
[24:38.52]Watch out.
[24:45.33]Wow, that's like the first time you've actually used your pirate ability.
[24:48.47]The hell are you talking about?
[24:50.63]I've been doing it like all the time.
[24:52.36]Have you?
[24:53.36]Yeah.
[24:53.86]I feel like you're not really benefiting from being a pirate that much.
[24:57.68]I feel like you're just not paying attention.
[25:00.74]And you're also a dummy.
[25:08.45]Oh, nice pirate ability there.
[25:09.55]Uh, later.
[25:10.51]See ya.
[25:14.79]That's really helpful.
[25:31.84]I just got a devilish something achievement?
[25:34.80]I don't know why.
[25:35.38]I don't know what I did.
[25:38.20]I don't really feel like I was doing anything special.
[25:43.18]Also keep in mind the, uh, the pirate shot has like a 10 second cooldown on it.
[25:46.94]Oh, does it?
[25:47.82]Yes.
[25:50.21]Kill Danny Trejo real quick.
[25:52.13]I will.
[25:52.91]When he jumps over.
[25:56.77]Or you'll do it.
[25:57.95]Either one.
[26:00.83]I have a lot of bombs.
[26:01.67]Come on, come back, bridge.
[26:04.48]I don't feel like jumping.
[26:05.24]I have a lot of bombs and not a lot of health.
[26:11.85]Wheel of misfortune.
[26:14.05]Well, this is where our run dies, right?
[26:16.22]Yep.
[26:18.16]I'm not going to get a fucking unusual.
[26:19.68]I never do.
[26:27.51]Come on, give us something cool.
[26:29.97]Not the room full of ogres again.
[26:31.27]That was horrible.
[26:32.55]Not again.
[26:32.99]Buff guy, buff guy.
[26:37.12]oh wow that's pretty good that seems like a good one can you press uh press select and see what your spell damage is at 20. I think they gave us five of all of those yeah pirate I don't know because my health is halved can I to make this pirate go do something else while we play is it actually hitting things
[27:05.97]I don't know.
[27:07.13]I don't think so.
[27:08.45]He might be.
[27:10.17]Either that or he's just being annoying to people and that does damage.
[27:18.46]Oh.
[27:19.52]Oh, that's... We found this before and didn't realize it was the best thing ever.
[27:24.52]I really want that teleport.
[27:25.86]Dwarven contraption.
[27:27.50]It automatically unlocks chests, makes bridges, or puts people in a box.
[27:34.01]Sounds kind of cool.
[27:35.08]It's the Skyrim weapon.
[27:36.64]I really want to teleport, though.
[27:40.49]I like to teleport.
[27:41.75]I am going to have to make a decision.
[27:43.99]I want to be a teleporter guy.
[27:47.15]I'd recommend that, though.
[27:48.73]You throw it a couple feet, and then whatever it hits is a multi-tool kind of thing.
[27:55.05]So if you throw it over an edge, it'll make a bridge.
[27:58.75]I think it's a multi-tool.
[27:59.65]Yeah, you know.
[28:02.19]Alright, let's try this multi-tool.
[28:05.03]Alright, cool.
[28:07.83]How often can you use it?
[28:09.55]Oh, all the time.
[28:10.23]Okay.
[28:10.87]Yeah, that thing is really, really good.
[28:14.91]Yeah, remember I threw it on the ground and it did this and we were like, what's the point of that?
[28:17.71]And then I got rid of it.
[28:19.45]We were like, that thing's stupid.
[28:20.85]It just puts like a Sonic the Hedgehog spring.
[28:24.28]You can't even jump anywhere?
[28:25.70]Yeah, no, it's really good.
[28:42.03]Oh yeah, I have the slow weapon.
[28:43.23]What if I throw it on those spikes?
[28:44.48]Anything?
[28:45.76]No.
[28:46.20]I mean, I guess you could jump out there and... Ow.
[28:54.20]Ow!
[28:55.38]You waited too long.
[28:57.33]See?
[28:58.23]You waited too long again.
[28:59.07]You got lucky.
[29:04.15]Wasn't much in there.
[29:10.30]Dwarven.
[29:16.24]What are you doing, dog?
[29:16.92]What are you doing?
[29:22.16]Those overhead smashes, I'm just gonna keep doing that.
[29:24.50]Otto, what are you doing, dog?
[29:29.78]Otto?
[29:30.44]Otto?
[29:31.08]Otto, what are you doing, Otto?
[29:34.26]How about you play a game with your friend?
[29:36.18]What am I doing?
[29:38.48]More damage than you?
[29:40.04]More gold collected?
[29:41.14]Wow.
[29:43.48]What am I supposed to do?
[29:44.88]I have the curse that makes... Okay, it's this guy again.
[29:47.18]So if I do this, what happens if I do this?
[29:51.74]Can he come out?
[29:55.13]I guess only one can be out of the time.
[29:56.51]I don't know how long those last either.
[29:59.41]I have the giant strength thing again, so let's kick this guy's ass.
[30:13.77]Die.
[30:24.02]I forgot I had that.
[30:25.04]Might as well use it.
[30:26.20]Yeah, I guess might as well.
[30:27.24]Can you destroy this?
[30:29.76]Yep.
[30:31.66]I'm killing him.
[30:34.28]I wonder if they can't get in the hole.
[30:36.73]Oh, wow.
[30:37.73]No, they can't.
[30:39.07]Game over.
[30:40.71]They cannot go anywhere.
[30:44.31]that's awesome dummies yeah that's a great item to use here wow learn the strats oh well he comes back when he comes back he okay oh no he has to die he only comes back to die because we killed them all yeah but still just be careful when you're doing that oh what are you doing dog
[31:07.32]noice it's like we've played this game before and we're getting better at it yeah um dirty those dirty big enemies and bosses that's like the boss killer I guess I kind of want to take it minus one damage I think oh I like this a lot yeah that one that's the one I was using that's really good
[31:33.64]Um, I feel like the Dwarven machine is good, but I don't know.
[31:39.06]I kind of like Lightning Man.
[31:42.16]Yeah, I'm gonna use this axe for sure.
[31:46.02]The I kill boss axe?
[31:47.38]Yeah.
[31:48.40]It's only one damage less than the other big one.
[31:50.52]What is that frickin... Oh, scroll.
[31:55.24]Is the scroll to give a curse?
[31:56.80]Yeah, I don't want that shit.
[31:58.30]I should probably take that.
[31:59.67]If you want the spell damage.
[32:01.54]Well, and curse, because I am curse man.
[32:04.17]Oh yeah, and your sword will do more damage.
[32:06.45]Curse of Midas?
[32:07.25]That has something to do with gold, and you can't pick up food.
[32:11.47]Food turns into gold on touch.
[32:13.73]I can no longer pick up food.
[32:15.27]Well, take Santa Claus, too, because I don't want any of those fucking flyy guys.
[32:18.81]We're doing really well.
[32:19.75]I still have, like, the one-up guardian.
[32:22.96]Yeah, you do.
[32:24.44]Alright, let's go.
[32:24.98]Okay, let's move.
[32:27.97]Otto, do you have to go out?
[32:29.47]Yeah, you probably do.
[32:31.85]Jerm has to go in 10 minutes.
[32:34.09]I actually do.
[32:35.85]Once we lose here, I'm going to take my dog out.
[32:39.63]So I don't touch food.
[32:43.00]I can't touch anything at this point.
[32:45.18]But you're still going to keep opening everything.
[32:51.80]That's doing a lot of damage.
[32:53.64]I have so much spell damage, that's really good.
[32:59.67]You better frickin' unlock Battlemage.
[33:02.59]I'm sorry.
[33:03.17]I have too many things.
[33:08.70]Another spell book.
[33:10.64]Should I get this thing?
[33:13.16]Which spell book?
[33:14.62]It's a book of magic.
[33:15.70]Spell damage plus five.
[33:17.00]Oh, yeah.
[33:18.80]Even more spell damage.
[33:20.17]What the hell is this?
[33:21.83]Multiplies thrown weapons.
[33:24.03]Makes them weaker.
[33:28.24]um you got to take the armor too because I can't wear it alright yeah okay watch out for the round men yep
[33:52.25]I just had to say round men again.
[33:53.51]Dude, this weapon's crazy good.
[33:55.49]This like has the range of the fantasy sword.
[33:59.81]But like a billion times more damage.
[34:03.67]The fantasy sword.
[34:09.75]If only I could spend this money.
[34:11.74]So, when we get to like an area where we can stop for a minute, I need to let this dog out.
[34:17.84]I need to go walk my dog.
[34:19.76]Wow.
[34:20.66]Wow, big surprise.
[34:21.92]I'm going to the shop.
[34:24.80]Oh boy, this is not a shop.
[34:26.98]This is not a shop.
[34:31.76]Oh, dude!
[34:33.36]You throw three things.
[34:34.84]I thought as you pick up more, you actually throw three bombs in an arc.
[34:41.17]They do less damage, though.
[34:42.07]They're weaker.
[34:44.55]Yeah, I just thought it multiplied what you picked up, not what you actually threw.
[34:49.06]So you're going to be playing this game solo for about 10 minutes.
[34:51.23]I hope you realize that.
[34:55.39]I want more diseases.
[34:57.09]Dude, your damage has to be, like, insane.
[35:00.17]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[35:02.85]Okay, so this is where we chill out for a minute.
[35:06.21]Am I getting one of these?
[35:08.78]Oh, you already have one.
[35:10.08]Yeah, I do.
[35:12.05]There, you take these other, like, you take another Santa.
[35:14.33]Can I have two of these?
[35:15.33]Can you?
[35:16.73]There's an achievement for having seven things following you as well that maybe we can get you up to.
[35:20.35]Yeah, that's another one of those following things.
[35:22.36]And that one, yeah.
[35:24.34]They're annoying!
[35:25.20]They're so annoying!
[35:27.72]This is not even, I don't even like this.
[35:29.85]This sucks.
[35:31.49]Alright, uh, I... You're gonna have to give me like 5-10 minutes.
[35:34.42]You can either hang out in here, tell a funny story, or go play the game by yourself, like in Toronto today.
[35:40.28]Nah, I'm gonna tell a funny story, you just hurry, I'm back.
[35:42.54]Okay, you tell a funny story, I'll be back.
[35:46.00]Alright, let's go.
[35:47.54]Well guys... Here's the story.
[35:51.52]I got some lemonade.
[35:53.02]I'm pouring the lemonade.
[35:56.32]You like these sound effects?
[36:00.27]Probably was pretty loud lemonade.
[36:01.63]I'm drinking the lemonade.
[36:08.45]I don't think I have any stories.
[36:10.97]I was trying to think earlier today, like I just moved.
[36:13.00]Like I know I had a ton of moving stories and now I can't think of any of them.
[36:19.50]I know a homeless guy tried to ask to like help us move us in.
[36:23.98]That's not even a story though.
[36:25.10]That's just like, we're in a city.
[36:28.54]Homeless guy sees you moving, wants to help, even though he is... He's a very frail man.
[36:35.40]You can't carry no boxes.
[36:38.09]Homeless people are never muscular.
[36:41.05]You know, like, people in prison have nothing to do, so they work out all day, do push-ups, do whatever.
[36:45.59]You'd think homeless people would be doing more push-ups and just be, like, really jacked.
[36:49.37]I guess it's, like, a health thing.
[36:51.58]I don't know what they eat.
[36:52.32]I don't think they know what they eat.
[36:56.91]I don't have that many homeless people stories.
[36:59.07]I'm still in Boston.
[36:59.77]Yeah, I'm not far from where I was.
[37:01.17]It's much nicer here.
[37:03.09]I am, like, stress level dropped a billion percent just from, like, not being where I was.
[37:11.95]And my bathroom is in the jungle, so I don't get to tell that story.
[37:14.87]Now the only story related to my bathroom is that the toilet is, like, a foot off the ground.
[37:20.21]It's the smallest toilet ever.
[37:24.08]They ate Pringles?
[37:24.78]That's true, I guess.
[37:25.64]I mean, that guy could be doing, like, push-ups all day, handjobs, or whatever he was doing.
[37:30.86]He'd have, like, a... Has anyone ever seen a buff homeless dude?
[37:36.41]I'm sorry to go back, but has anyone?
[37:42.73]I would think there'd be more.
[37:43.77]It's not like they have Bowflexes, but, I mean, what else are they doing?
[37:54.71]I'm gonna do a research paper.
[38:00.94]A lot of splash from peeing?
[38:02.84]Not really.
[38:04.96]It's much less of an inconvenience than I thought it would have been.
[38:17.89]Hardened street life?
[38:18.79]I feel you.
[38:23.37]Um...
[38:27.96]I don't know
[38:31.59]Oh, dude, what I wanted to tell everybody, dude, like, I've put all this shit behind me.
[38:35.93]Like, when I moved from New Jersey to Boston in the first place, like, everything that happened in my life while I lived in New Jersey is, like, I don't remember what happened.
[38:45.10]That's all in the past.
[38:47.04]Like, moving is a big deal for me.
[38:49.22]So I already forgot.
[38:50.68]The day we were moving out of my last apartment, people might remember me complaining.
[38:54.90]There's many things I complained about.
[38:56.22]The radiator, the jungle bathroom, um...
[39:00.69]You know, whatever.
[39:03.31]But the elevator in that building was broken for like eight months.
[39:07.05]And it was, it was brou brou because I was on the sixth floor and we had to walk up and down six flights of stairs over and over again.
[39:13.24]So they completely redid the elevator so that it'd be ready for the new people to move in so that they couldn't be like, dude, I'm not renting an apartment in this building that has like no elevator.
[39:22.80]So they fixed up the elevator.
[39:24.77]Every single part was replaced.
[39:26.65]They worked on it for like two months.
[39:28.27]It took them forever.
[39:29.31]That thing was built to be impervious.
[39:32.87]Punchline is, of course, the day we're moving out and I'm up on the sixth floor, the elevator is broken again.
[39:39.97]And everyone who's moving out can't use the elevator.
[39:42.99]The sign on the bottom floor on the elevator door just said, Need repairs.
[39:49.89]Missing parts.
[39:52.06]That was the biggest bullshit ever, because the building manager who lived there, who probably put that side in there, moved out three days ago.
[40:00.44]Surely knowing that that wouldn't affect him.
[40:04.74]You know, just in time for that darn elevator to break.
[40:09.44]So that was like the last big fuck you from my apartment.
[40:13.16]It was pretty fun.
[40:16.08]It was really just needs parts.
[40:17.34]It wasn't specific parts...
[40:19.51]And it had a will be fixed by date on it, and it was like the day after.
[40:23.23]Like, this will be fixed by tomorrow, don't worry.
[40:25.85]But today is the day where everyone is actually going to need it.
[40:30.18]So...
[40:33.92]That's the day when everyone in Boston moves.
[40:36.32]Because there's a lot of colleges in Boston, so for the new semester they have everyone move around September 1st.
[40:41.76]It's like, oh, everyone's moving out.
[40:46.36]Looks like you can't scratch up my precious, shitty, closet-sized elevator.
[40:56.13]My whole building evacuated?
[40:57.45]No.
[40:57.91]I mean, a whole bunch of people were moving out, though.
[41:11.96]Um, those accusations, Jabroni, those are false.
[41:16.06]I'm not a buff homeless man.
[41:19.36]You know, actually, I'm gonna go with that.
[41:21.60]That's why every time I stream, it's like the first time I streamed and I have to redo all the audio settings, because every time it's someone else's computer.
[41:29.64]I'm breaking in people's windows.
[41:30.90]I'm like the most successful homeless streamer.
[41:37.39]I always thought as a joke it'd be really funny to put a computer like out in the woods and like hook it up to a generator and then record a video from there.
[41:44.78]Or something.
[41:45.90]But it's so impractical that I've like thought that was funny for at least three years now and it's never gonna happen.
[41:52.79]Who's gonna bring a computer and like a desk and a whole setup and like set it up out in a forest?
[41:59.01]Me, the homeless dude.
[42:06.38]Y'all help each other in a collective fuck-off to the landlord?
[42:08.84]No.
[42:09.26]He'd already moved out.
[42:11.48]He knew.
[42:13.46]And... Well, not the landlord, the building manager, which is different, but... It's all behind me.
[42:20.09]I've moved.
[42:20.65]It's very, very far behind me.
[42:23.31]And again, if you're just joining us, we're waiting on Jerma to walk his dog, because that was really important for him to do right at this moment.
[42:30.26]So it wouldn't pee everywhere, I suppose.
[42:32.12]Pee is bad.
[42:37.58]Moving boxes sucks though At the same time it didn't part of me like we hired movers and I was like These dudes are making so much money today And they're getting so much exercise.
[42:51.13]They're getting paid a ridiculous amount to go to the gym.
[42:54.61]I
[42:58.15]It seemed like a good life, man.
[43:00.81]It's not like the people, the movers, are really, really buff.
[43:03.93]Like, dude, we do this all the time.
[43:05.41]We're so big.
[43:07.67]All we do is push-ups.
[43:08.63]We're basically not homeless people.
[43:11.12]They're just kind of average dudes that made a lot of money one day.
[43:18.86]It is exhausting, but the second movers we had Ashley saying in chat that the first movers refused to talk at all just so they could get it done.
[43:26.31]The second movers...
[43:29.33]I don't know.
[43:29.94]If you get into a groove, you energy drink up, you get in the mood for it.
[43:33.94]He was, like, by the time we were done moving our shit and he had to, like, wait around for a ride, he was so, like, jazzed and, like, you know, in the mood to keep doing physical activity.
[43:43.01]He, like, helped the neighbors move in a little bit, too.
[43:45.17]He, like, just ran over there and was like, hey, I'll carry these, like, four boxes up for you and just, like, kept moving things.
[43:52.26]Those guys are pretty cool.
[44:03.62]How old am I?
[44:05.56]I'm 25 now.
[44:09.85]I lost 10 pounds.
[44:12.35]Wow.
[44:13.69]What a guy.
[44:14.27]I don't know when I lost them.
[44:17.49]Because I weighed myself for the first time in like a month or two yesterday.
[44:21.77]Because me and Ashley moved in together and we've inherited each other's stuff, which means I have like... I can weigh myself now.
[44:29.67]What are those things called?
[44:30.61]I was gonna call it a thermostat.
[44:34.30]Oh, where?
[44:34.92]Man, I inherited that.
[44:49.70]A scale.
[44:50.30]Dude, that's too easy.
[44:51.24]That can't be it.
[44:54.02]Where's Jerma?
[45:00.86]I think I just heard his door.
[45:02.64]A thermostat, yeah.
[45:09.90]Man, that was a funny story.
[45:11.64]Yeah, that was good.
[45:12.62]We talked about moving a bit.
[45:14.53]Yeah.
[45:16.23]Okay.
[45:18.77]You ready?
[45:20.03]I am ready.
[45:20.47]My dog has... Get it fresh in your brain that you shouldn't be picking up gold.
[45:27.93]Uh, do what now?
[45:29.11]Pick up gold.
[45:29.93]Got it.
[45:30.19]Hey Jerma, when you stand on something to weigh yourself, what is that called?
[45:35.86]Scale.
[45:38.64]Fuck you.
[45:40.06]You're supposed to say thermostat.
[45:44.22]Oh, I didn't know there was a funny joke involved.
[45:47.46]It wasn't a funny joke, it was like proving me right.
[45:49.44]Those are called thermostats.
[45:53.89]Like, where are you compared to how many things are following you?
[45:58.29]I actually am having trouble even knowing where I'm standing.
[46:02.48]That's the same trouble I just had, looking at you.
[46:05.06]I feel like I'm playing a mid-90s action RPG.
[46:12.68]Like, Earthbound.
[46:13.61]Well, not action, but RPG.
[46:15.19]Earthbound, Secret of Mana.
[46:17.55]All the people that just follow behind you.
[46:20.31]Um, wish me luck.
[46:21.75]Good luck.
[46:22.71]Oh, fuck you.
[46:24.89]Hey, wish me and all of my friends luck.
[46:27.53]Yeah, there are no enemies here, you just have to jump a lot.
[46:32.53]Isn't this the best magic in the game?
[46:33.67]I'm scared I'm gonna get shot by my own stuff.
[46:35.73]I don't think your own things can shoot you.
[46:37.85]That's good.
[46:39.13]This room BLOWS.
[46:41.05]I just hit you with every one of those, by the way.
[46:43.80]Nice random.
[46:52.38]Jeez.
[46:53.66]I can't touch food either.
[46:54.73]I'm gonna die.
[47:06.99]Jeez.
[47:08.19]Oh, you throw three, but it only uses one.
[47:10.07]I thought it also used three.
[47:11.09]This is really bad.
[47:12.79]I'm doing decent.
[47:15.73]I'm stuck back here.
[47:19.29]I'm stuck in this area.
[47:22.20]Oh, boy.
[47:23.12]I think I just hit you down.
[47:24.48]Yeah, you did.
[47:24.92]I'm dead.
[47:25.99]But it's okay.
[47:27.01]Where am I?
[47:27.57]Where?
[47:27.99]Oh.
[47:28.87]I, like, lost track of myself.
[47:30.03]There's too many, like, useless shits over there.
[47:32.93]That guy's gotta die.
[47:33.89]That guy's seriously ruining my whole night.
[47:35.79]Got him.
[47:38.17]I can't move from this spot, really, unless I jump over like this, but I'm gonna pick up all your gold.
[47:43.04]Whatever.
[47:44.38]I have 200.
[47:47.12]Any rooms with those mages are the worst rooms in the game.
[47:50.02]Yes, they're.
[47:51.20]Oh, god.
[47:55.33]Just cut that guy's head off.
[47:57.69]Dude, like, go away!
[47:58.95]I don't want all of those things near me.
[48:01.17]You think I want them near me?
[48:03.21]That's so annoying!
[48:05.11]It really is, like, the worst.
[48:11.24]I, like, lose track of everything.
[48:12.86]Like, you're not gonna go get that cheese, are you?
[48:15.66]I can't.
[48:16.06]I can't touch food.
[48:18.20]Food turns to gold.
[48:19.40]I'm gonna... Your thing already shot me.
[48:22.79]Yeah, it did.
[48:25.39]I'm not getting it.
[48:26.41]It's not worth the 5 health.
[48:28.69]What is that?
[48:30.06]Sacrifice 10 gold.
[48:33.76]Well, that's good for you.
[48:35.20]You don't have any gold to have done that?
[48:37.20]I can't.
[48:37.78]I don't have any money.
[48:39.04]Money does not exist on this character.
[48:42.77]Only, like, friends exist.
[48:46.57]Yeah.
[48:47.91]That ass face.
[48:48.99]Oh, yeah.
[48:53.04]These things are so dark.
[48:54.61]Oh, that thing fully healed me.
[48:56.71]What did?
[48:57.45]That altar.
[48:58.35]Oh, that's good.
[48:59.21]That was really helpful.
[49:03.31]Sorry.
[49:18.32]Ow.
[49:18.82]I dashed at you and you kicked me out of it.
[49:23.42]Is that the only level, though?
[49:24.74]I think so.
[49:26.00]Hey, don't let me get the gold or anything.
[49:27.40]Fucking cheapskate.
[49:28.94]Just have your, like, purple hookbeard.
[49:30.77]Got a problem?
[49:33.33]I could really use a potion.
[49:41.53]Yeah, you're gonna die.
[49:43.63]I'm in a bad, bad place right now.
[49:46.79]Watch out for the Bart Simpsons.
[49:53.36]That's funny.
[49:55.32]Because it's true.
[49:57.70]I also feel like they'd... They'd be in, like, a really, like, shitty, like, teach you how to spell book.
[50:04.25]Like, F is for Frankenstein, and, like, this is the guy.
[50:07.39]Yeah.
[50:09.33]That is a really good F is for Frankenstein character in a book.
[50:18.33]Jeez.
[50:20.17]I don't want to do that, because I don't want to knock you off the edge.
[50:22.39]Yeah, please don't.
[50:28.82]Remember, pick Y to just throw them.
[50:30.92]And make sure you don't hit the other person, because I've done that to you like twice.
[50:33.82]Alright, just get away from me, because you will get knocked off by these assholes.
[50:42.59]Oh, there's another curse.
[50:44.53]I'm leaving, so you can look at that stuff.
[50:48.16]10 damage against big enemies and bosses.
[50:51.02]Obviously I'm taking that because I'm like boss killer man.
[50:53.40]There's health here for you.
[50:54.42]What is that?
[50:56.82]Plus 22 damage, 50% damage to undead.
[50:59.38]Killing an undead spawns soul missiles.
[51:03.10]That's really good.
[51:04.04]But I want to keep my like, I'm the boss killer build.
[51:07.45]Yeah, I'm going to keep my... I mean, you can get another curse if you want.
[51:12.37]There's another scroll.
[51:14.17]Yeah, let me just... I'll do that first.
[51:16.76]And then take- wait, what if you like can't- Mighty foot?
[51:20.74]Oh!
[51:28.13]Oh no.
[51:29.01]Oh no.
[51:32.21]Oh no, it's over.
[51:35.26]I'm not coming near- oh my god, there are enemies over here.
[51:38.10]There's a ton of enemies over here.
[51:39.60]Get up!
[51:39.92]Dude, all your familiars can just like go kill everyone.
[51:45.75]Dude, the foot's gonna stomp and it's gonna kill everybody.
[51:49.33]Here we go.
[51:49.67]Watch this.
[51:53.37]It's awesome.
[51:54.61]You don't even have to do anything.
[51:55.51]Just stay over there.
[51:56.99]Stay over there.
[51:57.61]Everybody will die.
[51:59.85]Oh, no, no, no.
[52:00.52]Watch your move.
[52:03.92]I killed them all.
[52:06.10]I'm just gonna trust you.
[52:08.84]Dude, you just stay dead.
[52:10.74]You are going to be so useful as a dead person.
[52:13.00]It's unreal.
[52:13.58]And I have a guardian.
[52:16.41]Is there anything over there?
[52:18.41]Um... Besides enemies.
[52:21.19]Can I teleport over there and not die?
[52:23.23]There's nothing over here.
[52:24.80]Is there like a wall I can... Okay.
[52:26.54]There's a wall over here in the top right.
[52:28.32]God, that foot thing is gonna be bad.
[52:30.20]Yeah, you wanna like AFK and walk your dog now?
[52:37.66]Do I have to come back?
[52:38.86]Yeah.
[52:42.02]I just am waiting for the foot to hit you out of the air too.
[52:46.06]I'm not going near you.
[52:47.92]Just stay away from me.
[52:48.60]Oh, you see the red indicator?
[52:50.08]There is like an indicator.
[52:52.39]I'm at all times going to stay very far behind you.
[52:55.05]Okay, keep running around in circles, dude.
[53:00.73]Please give me a curse.
[53:03.29]Removes a random curse, holy water.
[53:04.62]Get that, get it.
[53:06.11]No, I don't even want to be cursed guy.
[53:09.01]I think you want to get rid of at least one of these, dude.
[53:12.37]I think your sword maxed out too, because it was already full.
[53:15.11]Well, here we go.
[53:17.27]What are we hoping for?
[53:21.12]No, foot stays.
[53:24.24]The foot stays.
[53:25.64]Rum, take that.
[53:26.42]I should probably take that.
[53:29.18]We got rid of the... I can actually pick up food now.
[53:34.57]I can pick food up, but what does it matter when there's a gigantic leg that's going to, like, mom's foot that's going to stomp me?
[53:41.58]That's the refills every room heal for 10.
[53:47.52]Oh, now you can't drop the rum.
[53:48.68]Yeah, now I can't.
[53:49.68]Oh.
[53:51.06]Maybe it's only if you actually pick up rum.
[53:53.60]I don't know.
[53:55.04]Okay, well, that is gone.
[53:56.14]I don't know.
[54:00.09]I'm gonna use the replenishing potion.
[54:01.58]Go.
[54:01.90]I don't want to get stepped on.
[54:03.48]Oh boy.
[54:03.88]Just keep away from me.
[54:08.04]I'm doing a lot of damage.
[54:09.12]And watch out, I make banana peels now.
[54:11.38]Oh, that's right.
[54:15.04]I mean, we're really powerful.
[54:17.38]There's just a foot trying to kill you.
[54:19.10]Yep.
[54:22.82]Going on the other side of the room.
[54:23.98]I'm doing sooo damage.
[54:29.23]So we're going to get to the end, and it's going to be, oh, look at how good we are and how awesome this run is, and the foot's going to kill us both.
[54:35.23]Yeah.
[54:36.97]It's going to knock us off into a cliff or something.
[54:39.55]Ooh!
[54:43.55]Well, this room seems... Owie.
[54:57.32]Mm-hmm.
[55:02.51]There's so many bananas!
[55:03.73]Hey, what is causing these bananas?
[55:06.53]Whenever I crit, I make a banana.
[55:08.47]And I'm critting a lot.
[55:10.03]What's my crit chance?
[55:10.96]I have to, like, wait and look.
[55:16.02]You stay the fuck away from me.
[55:17.94]I'm not gonna go over there.
[55:20.36]You take care of it.
[55:21.54]My crit chance is 5%.
[55:22.74]Maybe it was something else making... Oh!
[55:23.94]I know what...
[55:28.75]Did you get hit by it?
[55:29.59]What is that?
[55:31.09]Arcane missiles.
[55:33.79]No, that's different.
[55:35.81]What is it?
[55:40.45]Ooh.
[55:41.81]That's kinda cool.
[55:42.97]You can take it.
[55:43.51]Actually, I want that.
[55:44.53]There's other ones too, random.
[55:45.69]Because I will end up hitting you off a cliff.
[55:47.95]Okay, remember you have to hold it and you charge it and shoot it.
[55:51.66]While you slow walk, remember you're gonna get stepped on.
[55:55.86]Okay.
[55:57.31]Okay, kill this quick.
[55:58.47]I'm doing so much damage.
[56:02.51]Foot, foot, foot, foot!
[56:03.97]Wait, no, those are the same indicators for feet.
[56:07.03]And it's their... That's a lot of damage.
[56:13.27]Ow!
[56:15.44]Get the hamburger.
[56:20.36]Oh, come on.
[56:24.22]Okay, you stay here for...
[56:27.81]You want to know what happened there?
[56:28.67]Let me stay there for a second.
[56:31.61]No, I don't.
[56:32.95]You got stomped by a foot.
[56:34.39]Did you get frozen?
[56:36.01]Why did I get stomped?
[56:37.01]Did you get frozen?
[56:38.27]I slipped on like two of your bananas.
[56:42.97]We're really good at like killing ourselves.
[56:46.35]I just ran back for a health potion real quick.
[56:48.51]I'll be back.
[56:49.63]You can walk in the door now.
[56:51.21]Remember, I'm dead guy.
[56:52.77]Yeah.
[56:54.43]Oh, that's good.
[56:59.14]As dead guy, you can probably clear this next room, so like... Oh, yeah.
[57:03.17]Never mind, you're not dead now.
[57:07.41]I believe the foot is an instant kill, by the way.
[57:09.74]It hits you.
[57:10.16]It hit me.
[57:10.94]It didn't kill me.
[57:11.98]How much damage did it do?
[57:13.36]Almost all of my health.
[57:14.70]I was left with like 10.
[57:15.66]I don't know what health I was at.
[57:25.94]Dude, like, I feel like I can win this run, but not with you playing.
[57:34.47]Joe, foot, foot.
[57:41.61]Especially, like, against these bigger enemies, I'm doing so much damage.
[57:47.10]These things explode or something, what's going on there?
[57:48.82]No, they pop out of the beholders when they die.
[57:52.93]They're just like bonus annoyances.
[57:54.55]Why do I just drop the foot on you right now when you're doing that?
[57:58.07]I would not like that.
[57:58.93]I'm sorry.
[58:04.99]I'm sorry.
[58:06.47]Okay, let's go.
[58:06.93]I'm going to leave that there for now.
[58:11.36]I'm sorry.
[58:12.14]I can't control this.
[58:13.60]Look at how long that leg is.
[58:29.78]God.
[58:30.22]Oh my god, I can't even see where I am.
[58:41.53]The blood on the ground is masking that thing.
[58:50.00]This is not good.
[58:53.50]Did you slip on a banana, dude?
[58:55.22]Yeah, I did.
[59:05.14]What was that?
[59:06.38]Oh my god!
[59:07.55]There's so much shit everywhere!
[59:09.43]I'll go over here.
[59:12.15]I'll just fight this guy.
[59:16.39]How many enemies have hit you in this room?
[59:18.54]Like, how much of the damage have you taken because of us?
[59:22.62]It's not the enemies, yeah.
[59:24.96]It's my own stuff is hurting us.
[59:30.45]Can we like do different rooms?
[59:33.93]Oh, goblin wares.
[59:35.12]Oh, like a fucking giant hammer.
[59:38.22]That seems awesome.
[59:42.06]It's really nice looking.
[59:43.38]Critical hit chance plus 10%.
[59:44.58]I can buy both of these.
[59:48.31]What does the hammer do?
[59:50.01]Um, read it.
[59:50.51]Grand swing throw spectral hammer.
[59:53.43]Critical cast lightning.
[59:55.79]And I have a higher crit chance now.
[59:57.41]15% crit.
[60:04.55]Ooh!
[60:06.12]One of these times, that's gonna get you.
[60:07.28]Yeah, okay, I am Thor now, let's go.
[60:09.26]Wait, what's this?
[60:10.10]I wanna just see if this actually does more damage.
[60:12.82]It does not.
[60:15.11]This still does more damage, the curse thing.
[60:17.69]Okay.
[60:20.41]And I'm also drunk, and there's banana peels everywhere.
[60:22.60]Oh, and we have, like, a doom room.
[60:30.10]Also, by the way, I can no longer open up chests because I'll get killed by the stone.
[60:35.22]Are we doing this?
[60:36.96]We have really good gear.
[60:38.14]Do we even need it?
[60:40.22]I don't know.
[60:41.20]All I'm saying is I can't open that because it'll kill me.
[60:43.64]Because that'll step on me by the time I'm done.
[60:49.27]Wow, it really would.
[60:50.67]You have to open up every chest from now on.
[60:52.57]And even if you're dead, I don't think I can open them.
[60:59.85]Pick up that armor on the ground.
[61:00.91]Blocks all enemy missiles, it said.
[61:02.43]Yep.
[61:13.70]This hammer seems really good.
[61:16.81]What is that?
[61:17.23]What is that?
[61:18.07]I don't know what that does.
[61:19.27]I don't know what's going on.
[61:22.71]Why are they all feet people?
[61:23.79]I don't know.
[61:26.74]Something happened.
[61:27.64]Something happened that I don't know what it is.
[61:29.06]Do they get, like, buffed and have, like, faster run speed?
[61:31.46]That's my only guess.
[61:34.80]That has to be it, because they're running very fast.
[61:41.22]Whatever it is, I don't like it.
[61:42.80]Whatever it is, there's fucking banana peels everywhere, because my crit chance is higher.
[61:47.78]I keep slipping on them.
[61:50.87]Watch out.
[61:53.25]I don't know where I am.
[61:58.86]I don't think you can get this far in the game without having like like this happen though from everything we've seen like event like you just start having like an awful run yeah the last thing I want right now is the jumping disease what's left nothing jump attack changes the element of the weapon that's a really high damage one too alright immune to explosions or immune to missiles
[62:28.71]immune to... Missiles, I would say.
[62:31.43]Explosions.
[62:32.03]No, there's too many TNT rooms you walk into where it's right there that it's too useful to be immune to explosions.
[62:36.91]Yeah, but think of all, like, the people that do the ranged damage.
[62:39.07]I don't know.
[62:40.01]Do whatever you want.
[62:40.63]I'm going to the next room, like, when you're fucking, like, over here.
[62:44.11]I don't know.
[62:46.01]Does enemy missiles include spells, or is that just things that have to fly in the air?
[62:50.28]I'm gonna do that one.
[62:51.04]I'm gonna do it.
[62:51.54]Probably spells.
[62:52.18]There are a lot of the shitty mages, and who knows what's in these later areas, because we haven't really gotten this far.
[63:03.10]Can I keep holding this if I go in the next room?
[63:07.29]No.
[63:09.35]Come on.
[63:10.09]You didn't see that coming?
[63:11.83]I was trying to walk through the door, but I was like, why?
[63:13.83]And it wouldn't let me because I was holding this.
[63:17.67]I'm just, I'm going to pretend you're not playing.
[63:20.89]If you're holding onto this thing, you cannot go through a door.
[63:24.40]It's good to know that.
[63:30.26]I'm good over here.
[63:31.18]You're ruining this for everyone.
[63:34.20]Hey, we're fine.
[63:35.24]We're about to get to the second boss.
[63:38.72]Watch out.
[63:42.27]Good thing I didn't move to him.
[63:47.17]What is that?
[63:47.59]Cures diseases?
[63:49.97]Do you want it?
[63:51.71]No.
[63:52.87]No.
[63:54.05]No.
[63:57.27]This is not good.
[63:58.67]I have to get away from you.
[64:01.52]I'm going up here.
[64:02.64]Good luck.
[64:02.96]When you say good luck, does that mean like don't slip on your own bananas?
[64:11.53]Yes.
[64:15.50]God.
[64:15.72]I don't even know what just hit me.
[64:31.78]This is so bad.
[64:37.09]There's bananas.
[64:38.27]My crit chance is too high.
[64:39.45]Why did I do that?!
[64:40.29]I don't know.
[64:42.11]There's fucking bananas everywhere!
[64:43.55]This foot is gonna drive me crazy.
[64:52.31]How many bananas am I hearing?!
[64:56.94]So many.
[64:58.20]So many it's not even funny.
[65:00.43]I don't know why I'm laughing, this is not funny.
[65:06.16]There's bananas everywhere.
[65:11.42]One of us is gonna roll off a cliff with that.
[65:13.87]No, fuck, don't.
[65:15.27]What?
[65:16.51]I get to drink a potion every level, and I didn't get to do it in that room, because you left.
[65:20.23]Oh, well, whatever.
[65:21.19]It's good.
[65:22.01]We're only gonna do what we've never seen before.
[65:23.62]The foot almost... The foot was inside the room.
[65:28.81]They got Xenomorphs.
[65:31.11]I feel like they're gonna come out.
[65:35.57]Seriously, if we just suddenly start fighting like aliens and predators... What is... I... This guy will not stop whirlwinding.
[65:43.41]Is that his thing?
[65:45.47]Is this a boss?
[65:47.40]No.
[65:47.56]I don't think so.
[65:48.84]They're just the best enemies in the whole game?
[65:52.30]Apparently.
[65:56.40]Oh my lord.
[66:05.35]What the hell is he doing?
[66:06.85]What the fuck is he doing?
[66:07.85]Looks like a boss to me!
[66:16.12]What a terrible place to fight a boss.
[66:27.95]Yikes.
[66:28.41]I don't like this.
[66:29.49]No, neither do I.
[66:35.95]Why is he a pig?
[66:42.21]May or may not have just hit you with that.
[66:43.61]Yeah, you do.
[66:51.45]That does a hundred damage.
[66:52.55]That's pretty crazy.
[66:59.68]Oh my god.
[67:00.74]Of course he has like 16 phases.
[67:03.16]I'm just slipping on bananas over here like a fucking moron.
[67:06.25]Oh my god.
[67:07.23]Catch me if you can.
[67:07.95]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[67:10.93]We're pretty close to the end then.
[67:12.07]Hold on.
[67:12.41]Go back a room.
[67:13.69]Yeah, this is probably like the boss.
[67:15.25]I want to make sure we didn't miss anything in here.
[67:18.74]There's only one room.
[67:21.18]This is the only room.
[67:21.92]Both of you, we're both... At least you have a guardian.
[67:24.81]So when I inevitably die, I can still be useful?
[67:27.33]Yes, you will get stepped on by the foot.
[67:29.65]Well, inevitably when that happens.
[67:31.43]At least... Well, it looks like they're preparing us.
[67:33.67]Do you mind if I take this potion?
[67:40.51]Removes a random curse from there if you want that.
[67:43.62]The holy water.
[67:45.82]I would do it.
[67:46.30]I think you're still like two curses over what you need to have your sword at max.
[67:49.04]Well, let me do this.
[67:49.66]Let me...
[67:51.96]Alright, the foot?
[67:54.22]No, the foot is still here.
[67:55.40]Great.
[67:57.86]Okay, I think this is like a flying section.
[67:59.64]Jump on button, mount.
[68:00.66]Yeah, you didn't have to grab a mount.
[68:05.02]What the hell?
[68:05.90]How do we... Wait, wait, get the controls here.
[68:08.02]Is this Earthworm Jim?
[68:10.18]Okay, you can still... Is the foot still going to be here when it has nothing to hit?
[68:14.81]Yeah, of course it is.
[68:16.35]So your X is your random regular swing, and then you shoot with A.
[68:22.35]Okay.
[68:23.35]Hold on, what does B do?
[68:24.58]Same thing.
[68:25.76]What does the pickup button do?
[68:28.18]Nothing.
[68:28.58]Let's just go.
[68:29.46]Okay, let's go.
[68:30.02]Let's go play Earthworm Jim.
[68:34.26]Or like one of the Rayman Legends sections.
[68:37.13]Battletoads.
[68:37.53]One of many things.
[68:38.63]Dude, is there going to be an indicator to when we get stomped?
[68:42.65]Is that foot still going to come down?
[68:44.68]If it does, it's going to be so far behind us because we're scrolling.
[68:47.94]I would hope.
[68:48.88]It's like a bullet hell game.
[68:50.62]This is so weird that this is in here.
[68:52.70]Oh, and there's like health pickups on the ground.
[68:57.86]The controls are like really floaty.
[69:00.10]Yeah, they are.
[69:02.99]This hammer does like a million times more damage than these spells for me.
[69:05.53]I don't know about you.
[69:07.71]Get that health.
[69:09.29]Get them both.
[69:10.07]I'm going to keep going in for the slams.
[69:13.56]Nato.
[69:16.14]Nato, what's the problem?
[69:17.32]I just let him out.
[69:19.31]Nato, what's the matter?
[69:21.41]You hungry?
[69:21.83]Want some food?
[69:26.35]That does a lot of damage.
[69:27.45]Did we just beat the game?
[69:28.39]I don't know.
[69:30.49]Yeah, we did.
[69:31.35]That's the last boss.
[69:32.29]We win.
[69:33.23]We win?
[69:34.09]We win.
[69:34.73]We win?
[69:35.71]We win?
[69:36.35]We win?
[69:36.71]We got the golden crown.
[69:38.81]We win?
[69:40.32]Yeah.
[69:41.40]See?
[69:41.82]Victory.
[69:42.54]Yeah, we were really buff that game.
[69:44.99]We did it.
[69:49.71]We did it.
[69:51.47]We beat the game.
[69:52.89]We did it.
[69:53.67]We did it.
[69:58.12]We became stupendously rich.
[70:00.38]Wow, rip off of Borderlands.
[70:07.87]Okay, so.
[70:08.89]Does that mean we just kind of
[70:10.90]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[70:12.86]Uh, ShieldsBot, can I take a second?
[70:15.37]ShieldsBot says, wow, that seemed too easy.
[70:17.59]Fuck you.
[70:19.73]Try and get, try and slip on a banana and see how it feels.
[70:23.28]I've slipped out of an item before.
[70:24.82]I think the boss was just easy because I had all the boss killer items, like all the plus increased crit against him, more damage against him.
[70:31.10]I had a lot of that, so when I just went and hit him with the hammer, he was like, it was like 200 damage a swing, when everything else in the game does like 30 or 40.
[70:38.53]Alright, well, let's, uh, let's, let's get to the, let's see what happened.
[70:42.15]What did we unlock?
[70:44.65]Oh, we unlocked hard mode.
[70:45.39]Oh, I had battle mage.
[70:47.11]I still don't have battle mage, so you're gonna have to let me take spell power next time.
[70:50.13]I can be the guy with all the fucking shitty curses.
[70:53.74]Okay, so I am a battle mage now.
[70:56.40]Let me read what it says.
[70:59.56]Battle mage.
[71:00.04]Spell damage 10, vitality 80.
[71:02.08]Use evade button to cast magic.
[71:06.27]Yeah, there were a bunch of different magics you could do.
[71:08.95]By like... There were different controls, weren't there?
[71:12.91]Battle mage seemed to really complicate it.
[71:14.37]Like the gauntlet mage.
[71:16.65]Evade and jump is a teleport.
[71:18.38]Oh, okay.
[71:19.86]Like each button with invade is something else.
[71:24.58]That's pretty cool.
[71:25.78]He seems good.
[71:27.70]So you can't go, like you said, that makes you fatigued with everything.
[71:32.02]So you can't go by that, right?
[71:33.06]Can you jump over it?
[71:34.32]No.
[71:35.52]That's very good.
[71:38.44]Yeah, it is.
[71:39.83]So how do you, you just have to, I would have to get every spell damage thing, right?
[71:44.43]Because how else would you even play the game that way?
[71:47.69]I mean, does your like swing still do the same amount of damage?
[71:51.89]think so, but I don't have an evade.
[71:55.45]Like, I can't dodge.
[71:56.19]At least I still have that.
[72:00.27]Okay.
[72:02.11]Yeah, it's pretty normal, but let's see what this does.
[72:06.60]14.
[72:06.62]14.
[72:08.06]Let's see what a normal swing does.
[72:12.62]Yeah, it's kind of just like normally swinging at somebody.
[72:16.12]Maybe a little bit worse.
[72:20.96]Yeah, it kind of sucks.
[72:25.01]The teleport, I think, by itself is good.
[72:27.61]Dude, that teleport to the other side of the room spell that I had was kind of the best thing we had.
[72:33.97]So think of it like this.
[72:35.53]You replace your dodge roll with I can just teleport whenever I want.
[72:40.72]The other stuff is kind of useless.
[72:43.50]I don't know, starting with a fireball seems pretty helpful for killing the big guys that are hard in the beginning.
[72:48.75]Yeah, but I'm just thinking about, like, as you play on, like, after the first, like, ten rooms.
[72:52.19]Yeah, it's too bad, like, you have to leave.
[72:54.76]And we can't play another.
[72:58.58]That's really too bad.
[72:59.40]You know what I mean?
[73:02.56]Let's go, let's go.
[73:03.54]If you're gonna be like that, let's go.
[73:04.78]If you're gonna be like that, you know.
[73:09.20]What's the, what are the warlock things to get?
[73:10.92]Warlock, like, summons demons and shit.
[73:13.25]I wanna be warlock, man.
[73:15.07]What do I have to do?
[73:16.99]Tell me which ones it is.
[73:18.60]On the highway to hell.
[73:20.86]That's the one you need to do.
[73:21.80]Because I want to be warlock, dude.
[73:26.25]You need to complete a devilish rock off, exorcist, and elder wands.
[73:30.37]Did you kill 10 enemies with the mighty foot?
[73:33.69]Because now your stomp does plus 20 damage.
[73:36.72]That seems good for you.
[73:38.38]I don't know, did I?
[73:39.66]You must have.
[73:40.72]There's no way you didn't kill 10 things with that foot.
[73:43.30]Yeah, you probably might.
[73:52.88]These are all really important to do.
[73:56.86]Yeah, some of these are extremely important.
[73:59.45]Like Safety Dance.
[74:00.75]Clear 100 rooms without being hit.
[74:03.15]I have 81.
[74:03.39]That's 25% crit damage across the board.
[74:07.80]Yeah.
[74:08.52]Like, just kill 100 giants, then you do 10% more damage to giants.
[74:11.64]It's one of those, like, you'll be, like, infinitely stronger than you were at the start.
[74:16.56]Plus 5 crit chance, kill 25 enemies in a row without being hit.
[74:19.56]Yeah, some of these are actually extremely necessary.
[74:23.05]Like, plus 20 kick damage, what?
[74:34.75]have a thousand gold in your pocket, and you start with 25 gold.
[74:38.39]Yeah, these all, like, almost require 20% more gold from chests.
[74:44.39]To be able to play on the higher difficulties, you definitely have to have a majority of these unlocked.
[74:49.72]Yeah, like, break 200 shields.
[74:51.48]Breaking shields does damage and creates a shockwave.
[74:54.88]Like, how helpful would that be?
[74:58.89]Yeah.
[75:00.29]I just, okay, what's the warlock shit?
[75:03.23]I haven't seen it yet.
[75:05.02]The warlock shit is... Use 5 altars.
[75:14.14]I have to remove a curse for myself.
[75:15.63]I still haven't done that.
[75:17.33]And... There's one more.
[75:22.25]Devilish Rock Off.
[75:24.37]Kill 100 demons.
[75:26.43]I think... Kill 100 demons, use 5 altars, and remove a curse.
[75:30.76]I used the five altars, I think I've killed 100 demons, I think all I have to do is remove a curse.
[75:34.86]I need three altars.
[75:36.44]Yeah, that's all I have to do.
[75:38.04]No, I did that last run.
[75:39.56]Okay.
[75:41.94]So all I have to do is remove a curse and I can play Fun Class instead of Sword Man.
[75:47.11]Well, hold on, we got new hats too, that's the most important thing.
[75:49.81]I already put mine on!
[75:50.81]Ugh, can we play?
[75:52.97]Well, no, you can't.
[75:55.35]I messed up my headset real bad.
[75:56.67]Alright, I like the Executioner.
[75:59.85]Okay, I'm gonna run like a 30 minute ad right now while Dremoth changes his stats.
[76:07.22]Hold on, I gotta be like troll man.
[76:08.60]Okay, does the alchemist do anything yet?
[76:12.72]No.
[76:13.18]Is it just standard that you need one?
[76:16.76]I don't know.
[76:20.12]You can do it on hard.
[76:21.44]No.
[76:22.68]Let's like unlock some shit first and come back so we still have something to do.
[76:25.78]Okay.
[76:32.11]I think we got lucky for block.
[76:34.81]Y for... Okay, and then that's teleport.
[76:38.81]It's gonna take me a minute to figure all that out.
[76:52.39]I really have to do the hit seven enemies with the throwing axe thing.
[76:56.91]I added apparently a ton of damage to your thrown weapons.
[77:02.03]So I'm gonna try and do that.
[77:07.43]Money.
[77:09.03]Money.
[77:09.37]How much damage does this do?
[77:13.37]Oh, actually, it knocks him up.
[77:15.30]That's pretty good.
[77:17.62]Oh, you got an OTG?
[77:18.40]I have a knockout now.
[77:22.12]It's gonna be hard to use this when you're in my way at all times.
[77:30.62]Duplicates the random item.
[77:32.92]Book of Magic, that's obviously for you.
[77:35.48]Well, let's duplicate it then.
[77:36.88]No, no, no, no.
[77:37.70]Wait.
[77:37.90]What do you want to duplicate?
[77:41.37]I mean, we can just hold on to the duplicate.
[77:43.85]Can't you?
[77:45.77]Yeah.
[77:47.21]I'm going to hold on to it for a while.
[77:48.45]Because this is one of the shittier books, isn't it?
[77:50.66]Yeah, it is.
[77:51.06]Okay, I'm just going to hold on to that.
[78:01.82]Wow, thanks, Ms.
[78:02.42]Pauling.
[78:06.26]See how I beat that boss there, Ms.
[78:07.64]Pauling?
[78:08.78]We can swing through that, by the way.
[78:12.18]Are you stuck in there?
[78:13.74]No, I gotta walk out.
[78:15.08]I need that axe.
[78:17.35]I need the chief, man.
[78:23.91]Adel, come over here.
[78:24.77]Can you come up here?
[78:26.33]Come on, Kimiko.
[78:31.93]What cartoon was Kimiko from?
[78:33.41]Was that?
[78:33.73]No, that was the five people with the Shaolin showdown.
[78:39.59]Kimiko.
[78:40.17]No idea what you're talking about.
[78:41.65]Yeah, I'm just saying words.
[78:43.21]Don't really worry about it.
[78:44.69]It didn't have anything to do with anything.
[78:53.92]Can this go through that?
[78:55.68]I'm assuming.
[78:57.20]That's the whole point.
[79:03.38]It seems unnecessarily complicated for a very little game.
[79:08.18]This?
[79:08.90]Yeah.
[79:09.74]How do I knock people's shields off?
[79:11.06]Can I?
[79:11.40]Does that actually knock them off?
[79:13.29]No, I just did it with the jump attack.
[79:15.87]Oh, I guess I can still do this.
[79:17.03]Yeah, I can still do that.
[79:20.07]I guess.
[79:20.99]I guess.
[79:21.91]I have to get all the money.
[79:31.15]Your turn.
[79:34.64]Your turn.
[79:47.85]Dog?
[79:48.67]I just took you out and I just fed you.
[79:51.75]What's the matter?
[79:52.55]What do you want?
[79:53.93]What do you want?
[79:54.34]Come here.
[79:54.70]Come over here.
[79:55.22]Get over here right now.
[79:56.00]Come on.
[79:57.66]Is Shallon Showdown on Netflix?
[79:59.12]I remember like a year ago there was a whole bunch of people from the Gags2Gang.
[80:02.76]That must have been more than a year ago.
[80:03.88]We're all watching Shallon Showdown together.
[80:06.26]We're getting so much money.
[80:17.71]I actually do have a lot of money for only coming out of the forest.
[80:28.08]So I'm assuming this can only go left and right.
[80:31.38]The... Yes, only... You can only do it left and right.
[80:39.70]Yeah.
[80:44.76]Part of me now is like, why were we having such a hard time when we first started playing this game?
[80:48.65]But at the same time, I know how much, like, bonus shit we've gotten from doing achievements.
[80:53.83]Yeah.
[80:55.07]Starting out in this game was really rough.
[80:57.76]Remember like the first time we went into the forest and we couldn't get through it?
[81:02.26]Like four rooms in and we couldn't go any further?
[81:04.68]Oh, there's some choices that need to be made here.
[81:11.65]Random armor.
[81:15.75]I think you take the random armor.
[81:17.31]Do any of us want Coldjaw?
[81:23.38]I don't think I want it.
[81:24.14]I kind of want to buy things in the shop.
[81:27.18]It's nice to have, but I don't think I want it.
[81:29.12]I think I'm going to take it then.
[81:31.36]We need at least one shop buyer, because usually one person can buy everything.
[81:35.30]Yeah.
[81:36.32]What about the weapons?
[81:38.82]I guess I'll take the book, right?
[81:41.38]Or do you want to take a few?
[81:42.62]How many books do you need to unlock?
[81:45.80]A few.
[81:46.48]Probably a lot, actually.
[81:48.20]Is it, like, more than a couple, or is it, like, seven?
[81:51.74]It might be, like, seven.
[81:52.64]Alright, well then, forget it.
[81:53.93]Let's just, like, beat the game again.
[81:58.67]I want to unlock Warlock, that's the thing, so I want to get cursed and remove it.
[82:02.91]That's my deal.
[82:05.29]How did you remove... Oh, the Holy Water.
[82:06.67]Yep.
[82:08.33]Okay.
[82:24.63]Holy water.
[82:28.99]I'm so excited for holy water.
[82:34.66]Me too.
[82:37.40]I mixed it up at that time.
[82:44.73]Well, remember that that's in here, the elven cure thing.
[82:49.01]I have the heal for 50, gain a disease thing as well.
[82:51.91]That's too bad that that hits you.
[83:02.22]It's too bad that everything hits everyone.
[83:10.00]It seems like Battlemage sucks in, like, solo, uh, like, multi-person play.
[83:16.12]Well, it's... Look, it's gonna be probably pretty useful later on when I can block people from coming near us for an extended amount of time.
[83:27.13]More heals.
[83:28.79]There's so much healing shit around.
[83:31.66]Uh, just be careful.
[83:45.60]Why are the knives couldn't go through it?
[83:46.64]You're taking this shit out of me.
[83:49.22]Well, I have a long sword for that.
[83:50.66]I figured... I might as well swing through it.
[83:54.64]Oh, boy.
[83:55.17]Yeah, you can.
[84:12.16]Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't dude what a bunch of regular old beat-em-ups we are now Hi
[84:36.17]That, like, doesn't do any damage, even though you've gotten spell power as well.
[84:39.59]It feels like it all just sucks.
[84:41.69]Yeah.
[84:43.12]Maybe.
[84:43.52]I haven't... Maybe later, like, we really maybe should dupe some of the spellbooks for you.
[84:47.64]I don't know.
[84:49.34]If we see them again, I'll dupe them.
[84:50.74]I don't know.
[84:52.26]I don't know if it's worth doing that.
[84:53.40]I don't know if it's worth doing that.
[85:03.12]They can kind of just walk around the wall, too.
[85:06.78]Oh, I can do more than one, I guess.
[85:13.36]Ow!
[85:13.56]If only there wasn't all this health laying around.
[85:31.07]Yeah, he can hit you through.
[85:38.02]mysterious potion.
[85:39.06]There's this giant scary thing.
[85:41.40]Do you want this thing?
[85:44.14]Well, it's yours now.
[85:44.82]I guess.
[85:48.84]I mean, I can drink this and go back and cure it as well.
[85:52.31]I'm gonna go do that.
[85:55.71]You fiddle around with your shit.
[85:57.05]You walk your dog.
[85:57.89]You do what you gotta do, man.
[85:59.73]He's alright.
[86:01.63]He's being a weirdo, but he's kind of a weirdo.
[86:06.11]Oh, I just got ass disease.
[86:06.99]I don't even have to cure it.
[86:09.41]Have we figured out what that actually does?
[86:12.76]I'm still convinced it does nothing.
[86:14.60]It's just like a joke.
[86:16.28]Well, I have the Ninja Turtle armor.
[86:18.60]Where'd you get that?
[86:20.26]When I did the random armor effect thing.
[86:27.54]It drops pizza when I get hit.
[86:31.20]Yikes.
[86:32.59]Get all the way to the end.
[86:34.19]Yeah.
[86:35.26]Alright, now turn around.
[86:38.42]Okay, well that was... That was a teleport.
[86:41.28]That was good.
[86:41.78]Alright, turn around again.
[86:42.60]Haha.
[86:47.72]It only took like a fucking hour to set up.
[86:51.58]I'm just scared I'm gonna block you.
[86:55.30]Yeah, go get him.
[86:59.62]My spells can't go through that.
[87:00.66]Come on, now.
[87:04.18]Wish I could've dodged.
[87:11.56]Battlemage seems like they suck.
[87:13.68]But, you know, what do I know?
[87:15.90]Uh, take that.
[87:16.42]You're gonna have much more use from that than me.
[87:18.40]I'm gonna take that.
[87:21.67]Let's go!
[87:30.29]Alright, boss is on a full run.
[87:31.38]What was it, three?
[87:32.02]I said I think it was three, if I remember.
[87:37.02]There's not a lot of bosses, but there's a lot of rooms.
[87:40.68]I'm sure it depends on what difficulty you're on as well.
[87:43.36]I don't think so.
[87:44.52]Well, on normal, it's... I don't know.
[87:47.41]Yeah, run.
[87:50.09]That was a great wall.
[87:57.06]I'm just making obstacles for us.
[88:07.40]I'm trying to put another wall down.
[88:14.02]Why does it feel like I'm fighting, um, what's his name?
[88:16.92]Gas coin.
[88:19.25]Uh, from Bloodborne.
[88:20.73]Guys, I finally got to play Bloodborne for a little bit.
[88:26.59]That was... That was okay.
[88:36.03]There's pizza over there.
[88:39.32]That's great.
[88:59.15]Why am I so flaccid today?
[89:05.48]That's a Necronomicon.
[89:10.80]What?
[89:12.42]Uh, you take the dumb fucking dwarf thing.
[89:15.19]I'll take the dwarf thing.
[89:16.27]Hey, the dwarf thing has spell damage anyway.
[89:17.69]Why did I have it?
[89:18.93]You throw it at someone, it like poisons them while they're in the box.
[89:22.79]Oh.
[89:22.95]Oh god, didn't even know they were there.
[89:24.41]Didn't even pay attention.
[89:26.36]Well, they're in this room too.
[89:27.34]Pay attention.
[89:30.42]Oh boy, let me keep a wall up here.
[89:32.40]This is gonna be impossible to get a wall up.
[89:38.47]Man.
[89:50.13]How does that work?
[89:51.13]Are they cursed or not?
[89:53.27]Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
[89:58.29]I can't... I'm gonna trust you can do this.
[90:07.15]You can't do it to the big guys.
[90:08.46]Oh my god, you're gonna fucking kill yourself.
[90:10.44]I'm not.
[90:14.92]Um...
[90:16.97]Don't have to wait that long.
[90:18.49]I don't think I'm gonna be able to kill this stuff.
[90:21.30]Really?
[90:22.58]Dude, that weak and, like, useless?
[90:24.90]I'm pretty weak, yeah.
[90:27.16]Wow, I really should have duped the spellbooks for you, I guess.
[90:31.66]I was only doing, like, 25, 28 or something per hit.
[90:35.40]It wasn't even lighting it on fire or anything.
[90:37.94]It just seems like it's, like, you see, look it, you see, like, the time up there?
[90:41.56]I can't spam these, right?
[90:43.10]And when I do this one, watch this.
[90:45.70]I can't do any moves.
[90:47.32]That one is really not good.
[90:50.46]Even that too.
[90:51.21]When I put up a wall.
[90:54.63]I guess it's just you're not supposed to actually cast spells.
[90:57.83]You're supposed to do it randomly at random times.
[91:02.05]You're a battle mage.
[91:02.99]Battle mages also use swords in the lore, dude.
[91:07.38]Out of all of them, I kind of...
[91:09.94]So far, I don't know.
[91:11.70]I kind of like the assassin the most.
[91:13.10]Well, play him.
[91:17.12]Yeah, I kind of like the assassin.
[91:21.06]The assassin's probably my favorite so far.
[91:22.46]I just want to unlock Warlock, man.
[91:25.00]Oh, no, whatever.
[91:26.12]I like my crown.
[91:32.77]I feel like I'm a champion.
[91:34.59]It gives me confidence.
[91:38.53]That way I'm not so flaccid.
[91:39.85]This is the thing that strikes you, right?
[91:48.18]The lightning?
[91:48.58]Yeah.
[91:49.26]Half health.
[91:51.02]We should be fine, though.
[91:52.38]Is it worth taking that?
[91:53.36]The freezing orb?
[91:54.12]Is the freezing orb really not that good?
[91:56.68]I mean, if... Oh, you're not a battle mage anymore.
[91:59.02]I wouldn't even care.
[92:00.46]No, I think that item's not that great.
[92:08.68]It's not.
[92:09.64]Just takes too long to do.
[92:12.78]I mean, I don't know.
[92:15.56]We'll find another.
[92:16.78]We'll find another.
[92:17.99]I'll find another.
[92:19.87]Reference.
[92:21.83]Whoever gets that reference first wins a free trip to Malibu.
[92:24.91]If you type anything in chat about the reference, though, you will be timed out.
[92:29.23]There is no trip to Malibu.
[92:30.17]You're not thinking bombs?
[92:32.55]No.
[92:35.23]You always assume I'm bomb guy.
[92:47.14]I'm gold guy.
[92:49.40]I decided I'm the one who gets the gold.
[92:58.16]I'm the one who can't see his own character.
[93:02.94]I've also decided I'm that guy as well.
[93:06.38]I'm trying to assassinate him.
[93:08.60]Fuck off.
[93:10.38]Got him.
[93:10.67]Fuck off.
[93:11.97]I got him.
[93:12.75]I killed him, not you.
[93:14.43]I assassinated him.
[93:18.90]Dude, talk about RNG.
[93:20.32]What about it?
[93:23.20]Dude, talk about it.
[93:25.81]So, depending on where the two numbers, the minimum and maximum number, it will go... Let's say you have a minimum number of four, or like one and a maximum of twelve.
[93:37.83]It'll choose one in between there.
[93:41.23]Depending on how they've set the game up.
[93:43.15]Talk about it.
[93:44.59]I just did.
[93:47.18]Oh.
[93:47.64]Whiskey.
[93:49.32]Oh, pass the whiskey.
[93:54.52]No, I was going to say, it kind of sucks if you don't get the graveyard.
[93:56.92]Graveyard is like so much money and a bunch of free stuff.
[94:02.98]When you go through the forest and you didn't get graveyard.
[94:04.96]Reset run.
[94:12.20]There's a gold coin in the abyss.
[94:13.62]Go get it.
[94:17.45]There's two now.
[94:18.47]I want it.
[94:18.83]I was about to just do my dash move thing, but I did not want to kill you.
[94:26.95]Because I would have just guaranteed killed you.
[94:29.34]Absolutely.
[94:31.10]You don't want to do that?
[94:31.82]No.
[94:40.17]Well, there's only a duper we can carry for a bit.
[94:45.43]Your vitality raises every time you clear a room without being hit.
[94:49.96]I'll take the duper and this is just a default regular short sword.
[94:53.24]I'm assuming I should take that because you're gonna use the long one for now.
[94:56.64]Yep.
[94:58.76]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[95:00.26]Come on, we have to beat it in 30 minutes.
[95:12.14]That is a challenge.
[95:13.36]You'd have to sprint through rooms and you can't even pick up money or anything.
[95:15.67]Well, I mean, these early rooms, you don't have to kill people.
[95:20.05]No.
[95:21.61]There's a shop coming up.
[95:31.23]Nice gap achievement.
[95:33.32]Why is it raining in here?
[95:34.40]I thought we were in a castle.
[95:38.78]Well, we're outside the castle now.
[95:41.12]Oh, we're in the fjord?
[95:42.96]Yeah.
[95:47.70]Oh, I need you in here.
[95:48.64]I need you!
[95:49.04]What do you want?
[95:57.92]Um, honey!
[95:58.86]Need you!
[95:59.18]I'm killing things, I'm doing work.
[96:03.79]What kind of work?
[96:04.23]Your big ass sword just keeps on killing me.
[96:06.75]Keeps knocking me down.
[96:08.88]I just got an achievement.
[96:10.44]I think that gives my kick, like, plus 20 damage.
[96:13.58]Yeah, I just got that one.
[96:15.60]Really?
[96:15.84]We both got it at the same time?
[96:18.20]Cool.
[96:18.40]What's this?
[96:20.56]Transforms all the items.
[96:23.08]Oh.
[96:25.02]Superman potion is always good to have.
[96:27.08]I'm saving my money for when there's a shrine and I can remove a curse because that's all I care about.
[96:35.05]This demonic armor would be kind of good if I wasn't this character because I'd have 40 health.
[96:41.78]What does this do?
[96:42.28]I thought this was the fire armor.
[96:44.46]No.
[96:46.12]Oh, that would be really good.
[96:47.36]You can't afford it.
[96:49.10]It's a hundred and forty-two.
[96:51.58]Again, you assume I'm money guy again.
[96:55.35]What, you can't afford that?
[96:59.67]What, you can't afford it?
[97:06.11]Look at money guy over here.
[97:08.77]How much money do you have?
[97:10.39]Forty-four.
[97:12.78]There's going to be like 300 golds in his chest.
[97:16.76]That may be true.
[97:21.74]I got cocky.
[97:22.78]No.
[97:25.19]Show off.
[97:25.77]Do it.
[97:26.45]Do it.
[97:27.21]Shut up.
[97:27.65]I got it.
[97:28.03]Show it off.
[97:29.83]Show us what you got.
[97:32.21]Show us what you got, man.
[97:33.93]Everyone's waiting.
[97:34.53]I can't do it when you talk into my ear like that.
[97:36.31]I can't do it.
[97:36.72]I have a little spell book for you.
[97:40.95]Yeah, let me take those just so I can get Battlemage.
[97:45.07]You swing all weapons really fast.
[97:48.96]What?
[97:49.26]Took it.
[97:50.54]What was it?
[97:51.92]It was a belt.
[97:52.52]You swing all weapons really fast.
[97:55.93]As big sword guy, I am gonna do that.
[97:58.23]Yeah, that seems pretty good.
[98:12.40]I don't think 30 minutes is very hard for the length of the game.
[98:16.26]We were actually trying to, like, get through these rooms and, like, not fight things.
[98:22.29]Like, do we really want to kill this asshole?
[98:25.33]Yeah.
[98:25.61]I mean, do we really want to kill this asshole?
[98:34.13]Is that a trick question?
[98:38.12]Get rekt.
[98:39.12]See, lookit.
[98:40.92]All money for me.
[98:45.75]Oh, go get that money.
[98:47.17]Oh, look at that.
[98:48.37]Go get it.
[98:48.99]Get it.
[98:49.37]Get it.
[98:49.79]Get it.
[98:50.27]You run faster.
[98:55.22]Did I overjump it?
[98:55.98]Is that what happened?
[98:56.72]Yeah.
[98:57.64]If you had a double jump, you should have went this way to make it easier.
[99:01.34]I just honestly did not know that that was a character.
[99:05.46]I forgot you had double jump as that character.
[99:07.75]I really, really, truly did not think that that ended where that was.
[99:10.79]I thought that was the one.
[99:11.55]Yeah, there's another room I actually did that in when I was playing alone before.
[99:16.74]where it looks like it shouldn't end, but it does end.
[99:20.42]Just the wrong depth perception there.
[99:22.07]No, good one.
[99:23.55]I kinda look like a chicken.
[99:33.37]You kinda do!
[99:36.69]I didn't even think about why that was funny.
[99:43.74]But, like, I identify it as, well, you look like a chicken.
[99:47.50]I didn't think about it too hard.
[99:49.12]It's just the red head and the big white feathery body.
[99:57.79]Dude, swinging this weapon fast is, like, I have to put no effort in.
[100:03.45]No, zero effort.
[100:07.29]Things just get stunlocked further away than they can attack.
[100:10.80]I need that axe.
[100:12.16]Please.
[100:12.44]I have to do the achievement.
[100:13.84]There's another dart there if you want it.
[100:16.72]I'll go back, maybe.
[100:20.37]Maybe.
[100:20.57]That's a long way.
[100:21.31]Yeah, you know, I kind of don't even care.
[100:26.72]Let's go.
[100:34.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:36.03]Can we go to the bottom left corner?
[100:37.23]I want to get this achievement out of the way.
[100:39.10]Like, try and line them all up.
[100:40.44]Achievement?
[100:40.88]What the hell are you talking about?
[100:41.82]What are you talking about?
[100:42.52]You're going to kill us.
[100:44.56]I've got to hit seven things with an axe.
[100:49.92]That was not it.
[100:50.59]No, that was not it.
[100:51.61]Okay, I have no more axes.
[100:57.47]Get stunlocked.
[100:58.07]He's stunlocking me in there.
[101:03.11]What is with these, like, these gang guys?
[101:06.05]Still, I don't get it.
[101:11.70]Like, even when there are people that are, like, have desks for bodies, and they're giant muscle people, I still think those, like, gang people are more random.
[101:23.61]Goblin wares.
[101:24.61]That's new.
[101:26.36]Magic.
[101:26.74]I'm two gold off from being able to buy this.
[101:30.36]Cast reflection of a thrown weapon backwards.
[101:33.96]So it just reflects damage.
[101:35.24]Reflects thrown things.
[101:39.60]That sucks.
[101:42.39]I'm going to get it.
[101:42.97]Mom's eye.
[101:45.23]I'm just curious.
[101:47.01]Might be okay.
[101:48.33]Don't roll in that hole.
[101:49.33]That's not a hole.
[101:49.87]Never mind.
[101:51.49]I don't have a roll.
[101:54.45]I'm gonna go away from you.
[101:56.14]Look at this.
[102:05.42]Look at this.
[102:07.33]Yeah, they can't do anything.
[102:08.07]I hope they throw something.
[102:09.21]Yeah, he's gonna throw that.
[102:10.88]What?
[102:11.26]What?
[102:17.45]What?
[102:18.77]I just spent 60 gold to make sure that that didn't happen anymore.
[102:22.69]You're a chicken.
[102:27.34]Am I insane?
[102:28.20]What happened?
[102:29.47]Do you not understand?
[102:31.45]Juggler's magic.
[102:32.27]I just bought the thing.
[102:33.69]No, when you throw a weapon, one also goes behind you.
[102:37.13]What did you think that did?
[102:38.67]I thought it like bounced back and hit them.
[102:40.77]No.
[102:41.73]When you throw a weapon, one comes out of the back of your head as well.
[102:45.35]I thought it was like a mirror facing and it was like... No, it's a mirror so you can see behind you for when you throw.
[102:50.45]You almost knocked me off.
[102:56.28]I thought that was a reflect.
[103:00.99]He's gonna throw that, and then he does, and you're dead.
[103:04.17]I was waiting for it to happen.
[103:06.76]I was assuming it was gonna go back at him.
[103:10.52]You're just not that bright.
[103:12.16]Hey, you ever look in a mirror?
[103:13.92]What does it do?
[103:15.69]Looks right back at you.
[103:16.73]Yeah, looks right back at you.
[103:18.55]You just died.
[103:21.95]Maybe if I had a chicken helping me.
[103:28.38]At least I died in an honorable way.
[103:30.07]I thought I was going to bounce off the mirror and then go backwards.
[103:35.73]You fucking moron.
[103:36.87]If you face it, the person in the mirror is looking at you.
[103:41.37]But they're the one throwing the mirror at me.
[103:43.57]They can see it as well.
[103:45.77]That's a mirror facing them too?
[103:47.01]Look at it.
[103:47.33]See?
[103:47.73]You're looking at yourself.
[103:52.24]What boots did you just put on?
[103:54.62]Oh, I kind of like that.
[103:56.50]What is that?
[103:58.04]More damage?
[104:00.09]70% extra damage if there's more than three enemies around.
[104:02.41]There's always more than three around.
[104:04.57]Yes, there is.
[104:05.29]I have explosion immunity and I can walk on traps because I took all the good stuff.
[104:08.71]There's that really great rain of arrows.
[104:10.80]It wasn't that good.
[104:11.48]Do you want it?
[104:12.08]No.
[104:13.46]I'll take it, even though it's not good.
[104:25.40]You know what?
[104:28.23]Maybe she's just not that into you.
[104:29.49]I don't know.
[104:36.91]Yeah, that really great Rain of Arrows.
[104:38.31]How good was that?
[104:39.37]It's pretty good.
[104:49.25]I like Fast Swing Guy.
[104:50.33]This is, like, really good.
[104:51.85]I haven't even gotten any damage ups.
[104:55.78]Oh, well.
[104:57.86]See, we're blazing it.
[104:59.82]Think we're at the boss already?
[105:01.00]I think so.
[105:01.94]Alright, now one more.
[105:06.98]I need... Yeah, yeah, you want to throw axes at me.
[105:09.70]I have seven bombs, and I'm bomb guy.
[105:11.52]I need one more.
[105:14.00]Yeah, you are bomb guy, aren't you?
[105:19.92]Let me pick up the next gold.
[105:45.67]Oh god, fuck.
[105:53.42]I guess I really... I'm so fucking tired right now.
[105:57.58]Why did that just open?
[106:00.28]Did I just kick that open and not even have to do the thing?
[106:04.30]Oh, no, you have the boots.
[106:05.36]You have the iron boots.
[106:06.34]The iron boots do that?
[106:07.66]The iron boots kick open every chest.
[106:09.80]Oh.
[106:10.10]So, I don't know.
[106:11.26]I just realized that, too.
[106:12.30]Yeah, it's a good thing you... You're not doing very well.
[106:17.83]Well, this is why I said I only wanted to play for like an hour.
[106:21.03]This isn't why you said that.
[106:22.17]It is.
[106:23.67]It really is.
[106:25.38]I'm tired, and... Why are you tired?
[106:28.00]What did you do today?
[106:28.70]What was so important to you?
[106:29.52]I was at, like, a cookout and shit.
[106:31.70]You missed out on so many souls by, like, not even coming in this room.
[106:35.67]Oh.
[106:36.07]You wanna, like, help me with that again?
[106:38.47]Like, last time when you helped?
[106:39.61]Yeah, that was fun.
[106:54.92]Watch him jump into me.
[106:57.00]Watch him jump into me.
[106:58.00]Get out of here.
[107:00.04]How many souls do you need?
[107:01.58]Four.
[107:03.10]Let's do that and then do the Iron Juggernaut.
[107:05.52]So could you actually please come to this next room, please?
[107:07.64]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[107:09.06]Please?
[107:09.76]Please?
[107:10.36]Oh god.
[107:11.52]It's like people trying to talk to me.
[107:12.88]Hold on.
[107:13.28]So you enter the next room and go AFK.
[107:15.53]Alright, I go.
[107:18.61]You have to enter the next room.
[107:22.22]I thought we were... I'm in the... Didn't you want to do the Juggernaut room?
[107:25.66]No!
[107:26.12]I said let's get you revived and do the Juggernaut.
[107:29.62]Okay.
[107:30.96]You got it.
[107:31.48]Get your fucking chicken head over here.
[107:34.18]I'm fucking... Ow!
[107:37.64]It hurts.
[107:38.08]No, do whatever you were doing!
[107:39.70]Like, don't even play.
[107:41.46]You can't die.
[107:42.14]You're, like, a chicken.
[107:48.12]I can die, though.
[107:49.68]Yeah, because...
[108:00.37]You just kick it open.
[108:06.00]What is this?
[108:08.50]Get the darts.
[108:11.40]Let's go fight the Iron Juggernaut.
[108:13.04]Unless you have like, oh, someone's like calling me.
[108:16.39]Like I'm too busy right now.
[108:18.69]Shut up.
[108:32.84]I don't remember it spawning this many people.
[108:34.94]Yeah, it did.
[108:41.32]I don't think any of them were giants last time.
[108:43.00]Yeah, no.
[108:43.50]No, it did.
[108:44.12]No, there's one with them.
[108:45.50]Okay, there's a Hamburglar there.
[108:47.56]Be aware of the Hamburglar.
[108:54.69]Did you get the Hamburglar?
[108:58.21]Jeez.
[109:09.77]Ladies and gentlemen of the chat, this guy is a one-hit kill.
[109:13.67]I can see this.
[109:17.01]We're at least like a 50% or something.
[109:25.81]Saved you a life.
[109:30.09]Did he hit you?
[109:33.43]He ran into me, but he didn't kill me.
[109:35.71]It didn't actually do that much.
[109:37.47]Well, he didn't hit me with his hammer.
[109:39.69]Oh.
[109:42.25]That's good.
[109:44.08]Break shield.
[109:48.86]And I'm gonna take this.
[109:56.45]I get to be run guy for a few rooms.
[109:58.81]Wasn't there a cure-all potion?
[110:00.94]I think there was.
[110:02.12]I'll run to get it.
[110:03.24]I think that was in a different area, though.
[110:05.55]Actually, you're right.
[110:06.33]Yeah.
[110:06.93]Let's just go.
[110:07.77]I'll deal with it.
[110:08.25]It's fine.
[110:09.85]There's not enough bananas, so this is too easy, they're saying.
[110:13.91]We didn't, like, get anything from that juggernaut, by the way.
[110:16.47]There was a free scroll that I used in that room because it was dumb, and we got the dumb old hammer.
[110:23.02]I'm gonna crush the spikes for you.
[110:25.78]That would be swell, wouldn't it?
[110:46.33]Oh, great.
[110:49.03]That is just great.
[110:51.50]They're all done?
[110:52.46]Spikes are all gone, right?
[110:53.72]Yeah.
[110:56.70]Watch out.
[110:57.82]I threw that for you.
[111:04.00]Sounds annoying.
[111:08.18]I kind of missed my giant sword already.
[111:11.74]Actually haven't been that many enemies around.
[111:19.31]Whatever, we'll find a better one.
[111:25.41]I'm glad the fire doesn't hurt you.
[111:28.27]Watch out, man.
[111:30.83]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[111:31.53]Don't use this.
[111:33.16]I was going to blow these up.
[111:34.78]Yeah, blow those up.
[111:37.44]You get all that.
[111:43.21]So this is the warlock shrine, right?
[111:45.89]Well, they cleanse curses when you use them, I think.
[111:49.91]Oh.
[111:50.90]Don't they?
[111:51.46]Yeah, they do.
[111:52.64]But I, like, don't have a curse.
[111:53.84]So let's see if in this area, if we can, like, get me cursed.
[111:58.16]And then we'll come back and do that.
[112:02.08]Take that food.
[112:03.89]Whoops, that's a bomb.
[112:07.23]Take the cheese.
[112:07.67]I don't eat the cheese.
[112:09.51]Oh, well, I ran over that accidentally.
[112:13.11]Whatever.
[112:16.38]That's the exit.
[112:20.36]I guess you do the altar because you haven't done... Oh.
[112:26.86]Oh, this is just monies dropping everywhere or something?
[112:30.35]I don't even think that removed curses.
[112:33.05]No, it didn't.
[112:37.79]It's dropping a lot of money though, which is good.
[112:43.30]How long does this last?
[112:45.71]Um, about that long.
[112:47.41]Cool.
[112:52.73]Alright!
[112:57.51]I did really good that run.
[112:59.16]That was a great round for me.
[113:00.74]It looks like the Rhino from Marvel.
[113:02.84]Woah.
[113:03.62]I do.
[113:04.50]Uh, we haven't fought this yet.
[113:05.34]Dinosaur egg?
[113:08.62]Uh, ready?
[113:08.94]Uh, I'm ready.
[113:12.41]I'm so... Oh.
[113:15.35]Cerberus.
[113:18.17]I guess you take the right one.
[113:21.27]I'll take the left one.
[113:22.81]Let's try and get one off at a time.
[113:25.24]I don't think we should bunch up because that... Yeah, don't bunch up.
[113:29.50]That's not a good idea.
[113:38.44]Of course.
[113:38.76]Okay, this just got a lot harder.
[113:40.32]Yep.
[113:42.58]This sword is ass.
[113:44.06]I don't know why I took it.
[113:44.92]This left one's almost gone.
[114:00.69]At least the two middle ones and the right one are pretty close too.
[114:04.97]Watch out for the bombs!
[114:07.88]Uh, those aren't bombs, that's called Dragon Breath.
[114:11.39]Well, then watch out for the Dragon Breath.
[114:14.21]Oh, the fire's still there.
[114:16.13]Ew!
[114:22.70]This guy is just doing that right now.
[114:25.30]Watch out for the Dragon Breath!
[114:28.03]This reminds me of the, uh, the guy's head from Ghouls and Goblins.
[114:32.05]That shoots the fire.
[114:33.59]It does.
[114:35.00]The way it's kind of moving around.
[114:37.36]And staring blankly into my face.
[114:40.26]Being run guy really actually sucks here.
[114:44.85]Wow, I run fast.
[114:46.39]Wah, wah, wah.
[114:58.27]We did it.
[114:59.39]That was actually a lot easier than the other ones we fought in.
[115:01.93]It was pretty straightforward.
[115:03.34]Just boot it.
[115:04.86]That's kind of big and... Has a chance to drop an Arcane Meteor.
[115:11.86]Uh, you take the Swing Fast.
[115:13.04]Well, I like the Swing Fast.
[115:14.64]I'm just going to hang out over here.
[115:16.86]You just tell me what it all does.
[115:17.78]Because I'm not going over there right now.
[115:23.23]Which one of us was taking spellbooks?
[115:24.99]That was me, right?
[115:25.59]Okay, I'm gonna take that.
[115:26.85]You come take this belt.
[115:28.21]What does it do?
[115:30.65]10 damage against big enemies and bosses.
[115:33.11]Okay, cool.
[115:33.87]And what about the sword?
[115:37.71]I'll keep the hammer.
[115:40.35]For now.
[115:41.37]Let's go.
[115:46.80]Arcane Meteor does sound awesome.
[115:49.84]I hope it doesn't hurt us.
[115:52.01]Thankfully, this is only here for another one room.
[115:55.44]Does it hurt us?
[115:56.86]Nope.
[115:57.02]No.
[115:57.66]Thank God.
[115:58.32]I know, right?
[116:00.20]Thank God.
[116:00.98]We need some healing.
[116:02.99]I need to get out of Runguy.
[116:06.17]Why did you turn into Runguy in the first place?
[116:07.73]I forgot.
[116:08.77]I drank a potion.
[116:10.33]One of those, you know, the please don't drink me, but they heal you.
[116:13.72]Well, I'm like dying already.
[116:29.19]We're both very close to dead people.
[116:31.93]But one more room.
[116:33.60]If one guy wasn't fucking dying all the time.
[116:35.46]I'm over that.
[116:38.00]Oh, these eyeball guys.
[116:39.52]They kill each other, by the way, too.
[116:43.31]The eyeball guys will shoot each other.
[116:44.73]Like the gluttony beam.
[116:46.55]Yeah.
[116:58.18]Wow, be careful.
[116:59.51]I'm immune.
[116:59.99]Oh, that's right.
[117:01.59]There's so many people right there just like, oh my god, watch out for the bombs, you idiot!
[117:06.31]Fucking dumbass streamer.
[117:07.51]Is that just a fucking chair?
[117:12.53]Is that seriously just a chair?
[117:14.86]Where?
[117:15.66]The third one, what is that?
[117:16.96]No, no, that's the guardian angel.
[117:18.10]Oh, I can't see the guardian angel.
[117:19.42]I'm buying guardian angel.
[117:20.44]Uh, do I want to have a troop of people following me again?
[117:25.14]I don't know if I do.
[117:26.62]It is pretty helpful.
[117:31.49]sure thing you know this whole time I've had the thing that cures curses you dumbo yeah the whole time the whole time hey man we all have those days
[118:02.39]Yeah, some days we just, like, let people throw daggers at us because they think a mirror in our face.
[118:08.14]Yeah, I thought the mirror reflected stuff and you held on to that thing the whole game.
[118:12.76]So, you know, we all have our faults.
[118:15.82]Back up, dude.
[118:28.25]Bye.
[118:31.88]go go jumping disease did you ever overcome that yeah I did that you did okay that jumping disease potion is there for the achievement and you'll never ever use that ever again no it's not worth it hey look I'm gonna alter
[118:55.88]I don't have a curse yet.
[118:56.72]There hasn't even been a chance to get a curse, so wait on this.
[118:59.29]Are you sure it's a random?
[119:02.43]I think it's a random thing.
[119:05.03]No, we're going to find if a curse first.
[119:07.37]Okay.
[119:08.89]And if a curse thing drops, it's going to be from here, so let's go.
[119:20.22]Watch out, exploding bad guys.
[119:24.64]Watch out eyeball guys.
[119:26.18]And Satan.
[119:28.32]Watch out Satan!
[119:30.20]Watch out, like, Demon Lord Xeroxo showed up.
[119:37.09]It's so hard to see in these red rooms.
[119:38.55]It really is, especially when these guys are shooting the red beams as well.
[119:43.07]I have five health.
[119:44.63]I have ten.
[119:57.12]I got two of these lightning guys now.
[119:58.78]No, I don't.
[119:59.24]I'm dead.
[120:00.34]Well, you still have them.
[120:01.84]I still do have them.
[120:02.50]Alright, I'll keep Satan in the corner over here.
[120:08.62]Okay.
[120:12.22]Well, he's running.
[120:12.76]He's trying to.
[120:18.70]I'll kill everything.
[120:25.18]Alright, Satan's dead.
[120:30.56]Okay, cool.
[120:31.00]Hi.
[120:35.02]Give us a random blessing.
[120:36.84]Really, give us a random... We're finding those instead of the ones that give you curses.
[120:40.76]So take that.
[120:41.74]You take the blessing.
[120:42.64]I don't want it.
[120:48.39]I also picked up this, by the way.
[120:50.65]What?
[120:51.53]That thing.
[120:52.49]The dupe?
[120:53.55]That dupe stuff.
[120:55.01]Let me hold on to that.
[120:56.87]Righteous Strike.
[120:57.91]Cool.
[120:58.89]I kind of want to dupe this sword that I have for you.
[121:00.49]It's really good.
[121:04.51]What does it do?
[121:05.41]Drops some meteors when you hit people.
[121:07.95]Look at it.
[121:13.04]Yeah, it does seem kind of cool.
[121:16.02]It's better really well.
[121:17.56]I would... I don't know.
[121:18.50]I don't know.
[121:19.28]Hold on to the dupe because it might be something later on that we absolutely need to dupe.
[121:22.32]Not like a... Yeah, not like a... Yeah.
[121:25.64]You use this as well.
[121:31.12]Levitation.
[121:34.51]I guess I can float.
[121:37.39]My eyes hurt from these, Redworm.
[121:39.31]Yeah, go look over at your chat.
[121:41.49]Yeah, I know.
[121:41.95]Like, when I turned and looked at my other monitor, my vision's all fucked up.
[121:45.79]Yep.
[121:46.87]Actually, it hurts.
[121:47.59]I mean, that's what it's like when you go to hell.
[121:52.37]That's why you need to stay in school.
[122:02.17]These meteors are really good, by the way, if you haven't noticed.
[122:05.33]They are very good.
[122:07.46]There's a lot of them.
[122:08.78]Yeah, that was a huge amount of them.
[122:12.26]That's why that, like, huge group of enemies, I was just crushing them.
[122:32.35]um I just got another achievement okay cool cool story the rum is uh for an emergency it's a good thing Jerma's only gonna play for like an hour
[122:59.21]I was planning on, like, just taking it easy and going to bed.
[123:04.19]Isn't this taking it easy?
[123:05.71]No, this is intense and hard.
[123:09.95]Just let me play.
[123:11.11]Taking it easy would be if we were playing, like, Tavern Brawl in Hearthstone.
[123:19.27]Oh, that's a scary area.
[123:28.43]I hate these guys.
[123:29.39]It's such a fucking clusterfuck.
[123:32.95]Yeah, I don't even- I don't know what's happening.
[123:39.82]I can understand one of them in a room.
[123:53.59]This thing is so slow.
[123:55.15]This weapon.
[124:02.17]You die?
[124:02.99]I have the Guardian.
[124:04.49]Oh.
[124:12.23]There's a room you're gonna die in, this was it.
[124:14.74]Yep, this is probably it.
[124:16.20]What's up?
[124:30.34]There's your rainy day room.
[124:32.94]Rainy day rum?
[124:34.04]No.
[124:35.10]Yeah.
[124:36.56]For a rainy day.
[124:40.67]I'm into that.
[124:42.73]You're already wicked fast.
[124:43.73]Might as well be really strong, too.
[124:46.09]I would take the fireball.
[124:47.01]I don't know what you have.
[124:49.75]I have the, um... Yeah.
[124:51.63]Fireball's much better.
[124:53.45]Yeah.
[124:53.97]Plus I can shoot him behind me, too.
[124:55.72]Wait, the arrow's not going behind you?
[124:57.78]Wait, is this not going behind me?
[125:00.67]It was occasionally I did see like what what what it's not all of them Well, what a ripoff of the boys of Isaac Yeah on This is not a worst item in the game That is that's what this is supposed to do hold on I want to do a full mana bar I
[125:28.65]That was your minion.
[125:29.29]No, no, no, that was my minion.
[125:30.25]What does this do?
[125:33.99]Are you sure that's what this is supposed to do?
[125:36.57]I don't know anymore.
[125:38.58]No, I don't think... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you are the idiot.
[125:42.98]It's not spells, it's thrown items.
[125:48.80]Fuck.
[125:53.73]You had me all mixed up.
[125:56.43]That's like when someone tells you how to spell a word all wrong and you can't spell it anymore.
[126:05.83]I thought it meant projectiles.
[126:07.49]Like, I'm doing this.
[126:08.97]I'm throwing this.
[126:09.87]It should be.
[126:10.41]I mean, it'd be nice if it was.
[126:12.01]It's a weapon that's kind of like ass either way.
[126:23.05]Come on, come on!
[126:29.00]Oh, the chef.
[126:29.72]Let me get the killing blow on him.
[126:31.26]Get a hat.
[126:33.20]I don't even have it either.
[126:35.88]Didn't we kill him before, though?
[126:37.88]We did, but I don't know why.
[126:38.74]I don't think we got the achievement for it, strangely enough.
[126:47.37]Well, might as well hurry up and kill him.
[126:49.83]Did you get it?
[126:50.91]Yeah.
[126:52.36]How did I not get it before?
[126:53.30]I don't know.
[127:08.03]There's like not been a lot of stuff to buy from shops.
[127:10.03]I can't believe all I have to do is cure a curse and it's like impossible to even get cursed.
[127:17.28]All the other runs we've done we've been like had three of them at least.
[127:20.00]Yeah.
[127:26.42]This horn takes a long time to recharge.
[127:29.20]This is like Buff Banner slow.
[127:39.07]Got him.
[127:39.73]Oh, no, no, I didn't.
[127:44.59]That's a lot of knives.
[127:45.25]Yeah, wish I could throw them behind me as well.
[127:48.96]Hey, go stomp all over those.
[127:57.37]Oooooh!
[127:57.77]What happened?
[128:01.52]What'd you get?
[128:01.86]Oh, that's a... that's a very large axe.
[128:04.60]Alright, what are the ones you stomped on?
[128:07.52]I'm like trying to see.
[128:08.24]Uh, you take my old sword.
[128:12.06]Oh, and there's the curse.
[128:12.66]What's that thing even do?
[128:13.46]When you kill someone, it shoots out fireballs in like every direction.
[128:17.41]Wow.
[128:18.01]Critical hit chance plus 10%.
[128:21.73]I'll take that.
[128:22.23]Puts me at 25.
[128:23.39]I would take that.
[128:24.03]Uh, and this gives me a curse.
[128:30.15]Um, so, I feel like this run, uh, you're, like, unstoppable, and I'm just kind of the guy that's hanging out with you.
[128:37.95]Curse of Darkness, that's not even bad.
[128:41.82]I can't get to these boots.
[128:43.04]Oh, Fire Carcass.
[128:43.76]Every 10 seconds, your jump explodes.
[128:45.86]Immune to explosions.
[128:46.76]Take those.
[128:47.16]I'm already immune to explosions.
[128:53.23]Yeah, I'm kind of a buff man.
[128:58.83]So my jump explodes?
[129:00.27]Yeah.
[129:01.43]Every 10 seconds.
[129:02.57]Oh, when you landed it blew up.
[129:03.87]Okay.
[129:04.63]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[129:10.01]Spin it.
[129:11.07]Spin it!
[129:15.53]I don't like this thing.
[129:16.90]We're gonna get a chest, and it's gonna be four chests.
[129:23.52]You didn't want it?
[129:24.16]Come on, stay there, mystery.
[129:25.52]Mystery box.
[129:26.86]Mystery box.
[129:28.39]No!
[129:29.25]No!
[129:35.26]Oh, come on!
[129:38.92]The mystery was our game's over.
[129:44.70]Fuck.
[129:45.60]Let's go.
[129:46.20]Well, at least you get the achievement now.
[129:50.08]At least I can kick these open, because there's no way we'd ever open a chest.
[129:52.86]Oh my god, I just got hit by your foot.
[129:55.08]No, that was yours.
[129:56.27]No, it wasn't.
[129:58.10]Mine just fell right there.
[129:59.46]Oh my god.
[129:59.92]Yours is about to fall.
[130:01.02]Okay, well, if there were ever a time to need to cure a curse, now is the time.
[130:12.51]You're the guardian?
[130:14.13]No.
[130:14.89]No, you heal.
[130:15.45]You're the one that's, like, worth keeping alive.
[130:17.31]Hey, look, a curse thing.
[130:18.21]Is that... No, that's for diseases.
[130:20.99]Oh, that's too bad.
[130:22.67]Let's just go.
[130:24.79]You have levitate.
[130:35.45]Why did I listen?
[130:36.11]Why did I believe you?
[130:37.59]I, like, believed you.
[130:45.98]I'm an asshole.
[130:48.04]You have... Why did I just immediately just not even question what you just said?
[130:53.33]Last run, you actually had Levitate.
[131:02.10]Dude, think of it this way.
[131:02.88]I'm healing you.
[131:04.68]You have levitate.
[131:06.30]Oh, I do.
[131:06.76]Because I, like, kind of remember picking it up.
[131:08.92]Yeah.
[131:09.12]Honestly, I thought you did have it.
[131:10.88]I wouldn't have done that if you didn't just say, you have levitate.
[131:16.06]What is that?
[131:16.72]Oh, just, like, a slow axe.
[131:18.42]Watch out.
[131:19.82]Oh, my.
[131:20.38]I didn't realize it was two.
[131:22.00]Can you fucking stand somewhere else?
[131:26.08]This game is so dumb.
[131:27.20]I love it.
[131:29.22]Oh, get out of here.
[131:29.88]What are you doing?
[131:33.80]That's the strength you have- no.
[131:35.92]No, you have to drink the strength.
[131:38.44]And it always does that.
[131:40.08]I thought that killed you.
[131:45.49]I'm one- I am one health.
[131:49.11]You just need to kill three people and come back.
[131:51.07]Don't get killed by a foot.
[131:52.91]I'm gonna!
[131:54.63]One more, one more.
[131:56.42]I'm waiting for my foot.
[131:57.64]I'm coming, here I come.
[131:59.44]Oh my god, this foot is the worst.
[132:07.14]You're an idiot!
[132:11.50]There's no time for that!
[132:16.48]I hate that I have to keep track.
[132:17.78]We both have to keep track of two of them now.
[132:19.60]Yeah, we have to keep track of our own fucking feet.
[132:22.24]We have to keep track of where you were standing before.
[132:26.09]Not just yourself.
[132:34.21]I don't even know what time frame yours is on.
[132:36.27]This is bad.
[132:38.57]This is really bad.
[132:40.90]Ours are like one after another.
[132:42.14]I think mine goes down, then yours is like a second... I don't know.
[132:46.18]It seems like pretty random.
[132:47.48]I'm going up here in case this is a shop.
[132:51.36]It is.
[132:52.30]Voxel, enemy missiles.
[132:54.94]Mighty Crab Warrior, I'm not doing that.
[132:57.98]An Elven Sword.
[133:00.06]I can't take the... I can't get the armor.
[133:01.62]I have 200.
[133:02.42]I just can't do it.
[133:05.19]I can't buy it.
[133:06.83]Elven sword, it's the same as this.
[133:11.11]WATCH OUT!
[133:11.51]Like, I'm, I'm, I'm, easy!
[133:15.08]You were gonna, you were just standing there!
[133:16.54]I'm leaving.
[133:16.96]I'm gonna go fight more.
[133:18.26]Watch out!
[133:23.12]That was like, you were about to get hit by a fucking car.
[133:26.14]That was really worried about you.
[133:30.48]That really was, that really was, be careful, you're going to get hit by a car.
[133:35.91]Oh shit!
[133:36.77]WATCH OUT!
[133:38.61]That's the worst spot I've ever... I'm done.
[133:44.13]I can't... Come on!
[133:48.37]There was no... Where was I supposed to go?
[133:50.31]You tell me.
[133:50.85]I couldn't even see what you were doing.
[133:52.45]I'm just like pissed off at the situation, man.
[133:56.33]Don't stand near me!
[133:58.41]I can't go anywhere.
[134:05.43]Uh...
[134:07.23]Don't come near me!
[134:08.83]You're a ghost!
[134:10.43]I had the foot comes down still no matter what.
[134:18.23]I'm gonna get hit by a car.
[134:22.64]I didn't even cleanse it.
[134:26.30]What do these do?
[134:26.96]You can only pick one by the way.
[134:29.08]Choose wisely.
[134:31.26]I'm choosing the one we haven't seen before then.
[134:36.71]What does it do?
[134:38.23]Changes my face into an eye laser.
[134:41.45]That seems really good.
[134:42.13]You get to do the, you get to do the, it's brimstone.
[134:44.11]Yeah, I have brimstone.
[134:47.94]Good luck.
[134:49.02]I can't stand still.
[134:50.82]Nope.
[134:51.62]I'm, uh, I can't.
[134:53.00]I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.
[134:54.28]I'm going to the corner.
[134:55.98]Just try and, like, get it to land on them.
[134:59.02]It's gonna land on you.
[135:01.20]See?
[135:01.42]Alright, I'm back.
[135:14.20]I don't even know where they're going to be landing right now.
[135:15.76]It's blood all over the ground.
[135:17.26]On top of me, I'm dead.
[135:19.82]Oh, it's frozen.
[135:22.30]This is over.
[135:24.04]This is not over.
[135:29.03]Pretty much over.
[135:30.57]Don't even hit them, just run away.
[135:31.65]I'm going to get the foot to land on them.
[135:42.01]Oh, when I kill things, they still blow up.
[135:44.69]Do they really?
[135:48.65]God.
[135:53.42]How many?
[135:54.48]Seven.
[135:55.02]Seven?
[135:56.06]Seven?
[135:56.90]Oh, boy.
[136:08.57]Hey, look, we got the achievement.
[136:12.24]You did.
[136:12.50]Did you?
[136:13.10]I didn't.
[136:13.38]Oh, I didn't.
[136:22.06]God.
[136:24.83]Like, all my feet are missing this guy.
[136:26.73]You died.
[136:27.11]No.
[136:28.29]What?
[136:28.75]I played the sound like you died.
[136:31.51]I'm very much still alive.
[136:34.05]Watch out, watch out!
[136:35.44]I saw it.
[136:38.25]Five souls.
[136:39.35]Oh no, if you beat this level, the next one is the level over.
[136:42.13]It's just this guy.
[136:46.85]Drop a foot on him.
[136:54.80]Go, go, go, go.
[136:55.62]Out the door.
[136:57.86]Oh my god.
[137:00.97]If we beat this in fucking foot mode, we have to fight the boss now in foot mode?
[137:05.39]Oh boy, watch out.
[137:08.96]Oh, we're at the final boss area.
[137:11.02]Is it?
[137:12.22]Yeah.
[137:13.04]Well, easy, easy, easy.
[137:16.50]Easy.
[137:17.45]Easy.
[137:17.71]Alright, let's go.
[137:23.11]This is the final boss area, you're right.
[137:24.51]Oh, there's health here.
[137:26.85]I still haven't found a way to get rid of my curse, man.
[137:28.76]Hey, the foot doesn't matter.
[137:31.84]It doesn't fly with us.
[137:33.58]Yeah, well, you have to do this first.
[137:35.48]I walked in the door and I got killed.
[137:37.39]I walked in the door.
[137:38.61]Yes, I noticed.
[137:39.67]And died from your foot.
[137:41.95]Yes.
[137:42.91]In the fucking door.
[137:43.71]Walked in the door.
[137:44.73]I didn't even... Not even a tenth of a second to react.
[137:47.15]I died.
[137:48.75]My game loaded and I was on the ground.
[137:54.54]Your foot had to get dropped right in the worst possible fucking place.
[138:02.56]I can, like, stand in them.
[138:06.90]My things will electrocute them.
[138:09.94]I'm helping.
[138:10.36]You're knocking me.
[138:10.80]You're just knocking me over.
[138:11.88]Look what I just did.
[138:12.52]I just helped you.
[138:16.93]My weapon does so much damage, you're actually, like, like, don't hit when I go in.
[138:26.47]We're gonna be able to do this.
[138:29.13]Uh, you, I mean, you will, because I'm, I'm, you have to kill ten things.
[138:34.67]I'm just hoping that I land on him with a foot.
[138:41.73]Alright, well here he goes.
[138:46.93]Catch me if you can.
[138:47.62]Oh yeah, he flies away.
[138:50.14]Alright, guys.
[138:51.00]Watch out, watch out.
[138:54.34]I bet there's a lot of good foot puns going on.
[139:01.08]Is that a Nazi unicorn?
[139:03.78]What?
[139:06.15]Right at the last second, holy water.
[139:09.53]I can play Warlock.
[139:10.35]Let's play with our Nazi unicorns.
[139:14.43]Alright, bye.
[139:16.37]Can I fly like this?
[139:17.59]Can you get on one?
[139:18.31]Why is my screen flashing?
[139:19.71]I don't... No.
[139:21.85]Oh, okay.
[139:22.33]Let's go.
[139:22.99]I can get in the trash can.
[139:27.53]Can I shoot?
[139:29.51]My screen is going nuts.
[139:31.13]I'm sorry if anyone's having a seizure right now and it's my fault.
[139:37.39]But I am also having a seizure.
[139:40.41]What's going on?
[139:41.07]Your screen is flashing?
[139:42.53]A lot.
[139:42.95]What the hell is that?
[139:52.14]I don't know.
[139:52.60]A shield or something?
[139:58.24]This is really hard to dodge.
[140:01.16]Last time was easy.
[140:01.88]You just gave us a bunch of health.
[140:05.12]Kill the little shits so I can come back.
[140:10.80]How many more?
[140:11.18]Two.
[140:12.22]One.
[140:12.98]One just died.
[140:16.79]Oh dear, you're... Okay, here I am.
[140:18.21]Hello.
[140:22.37]Oh, I think I know what you're talking about now.
[140:23.57]My screen's doing it too.
[140:24.67]It's like the forest flashing.
[140:26.07]Yeah, I thought it was me because I had the... Like, the bottom left is flashing a ton.
[140:29.35]Yeah.
[140:30.87]That just started happening to me too.
[140:33.73]This area is actually really easy.
[140:35.25]The amount of health it gives you is insane.
[140:37.43]Yeah.
[140:39.05]And you're usually pretty buff by now.
[140:43.76]Kill me now!
[140:44.10]What?
[140:44.22]I'm reading the chat.
[140:46.83]Is that what he says?
[140:48.19]No.
[140:57.14]Oh my god, dude.
[140:58.14]I'm playing this.
[140:59.08]Remember that, guys.
[141:03.15]Fuck.
[141:03.71]Who cares about getting hit?
[141:04.51]Just kill him.
[141:06.07]Like, let's have this be done with.
[141:08.79]Jeez.
[141:10.09]I can't believe we did that.
[141:11.37]We actually beat that after all the stupidness that happened.
[141:14.64]I think we've gotten the game figured out a bit.
[141:18.74]We probably could go on hard.
[141:24.80]Nice.
[141:25.86]Okay.
[141:26.90]Warlock.
[141:27.35]What does he do?
[141:35.73]I don't know.
[141:36.01]How do I do it?
[141:38.12]It at least uses demons to fight and survive.
[141:40.86]It doesn't say how to actually summon the demons.
[141:48.54]When at least one demon reaches its final stage, Warlock is protected from death.
[141:52.78]Yeah, but I don't know how to summon the actual demons.
[141:56.41]So you cannot have a familiar.
[141:58.85]Yeah.
[141:59.97]I don't know.
[142:00.25]I don't know.
[142:05.97]I don't know.
[142:10.98]These guys, like, do they always have aura?
[142:15.24]Hold on.
[142:16.12]Let him leave alone for a second.
[142:18.66]This guy's kind of just, like, walking.
[142:20.40]Walk over here.
[142:21.81]I think these guys are yours.
[142:23.53]No, they're the tutorial guys.
[142:25.19]They don't fight you.
[142:27.27]Oh, well.
[142:29.85]Alchemist?
[142:30.41]Okay.
[142:31.17]Just want to check.
[142:46.81]I don't know.
[142:48.93]Let's just go find out.
[142:51.99]You really want to keep playing?
[142:53.94]I want to see what Warlock does.
[142:56.00]Let's see what it does.
[142:59.78]I'm kind of feeling like when I kill something, something might happen.
[143:03.34]We'll do some kills.
[143:09.48]I was hoping... Summoning a demon.
[143:18.91]Maybe it's just as you... Yeah, so as you kill things, it gets bigger.
[143:22.71]And then when that gets to level 3, you can't die.
[143:24.72]Apparently.
[143:27.82]I guess.
[143:28.70]Or max level.
[143:29.26]I don't know what max level is.
[143:30.22]Too bad I have like 40 health otherwise.
[143:37.41]You have 40 health?
[143:38.29]Oh, that's not good at all.
[143:39.17]I don't know.
[143:42.59]I feel like the level 3 demon will probably be really good though.
[143:46.71]Maybe I'll turn into the demon?
[143:48.23]I don't know.
[143:50.41]I don't want you to kill these guys.
[143:52.41]So we can see.
[143:52.97]Okay.
[144:01.46]He's not quite there.
[144:02.58]Oh, he shoots three?
[144:04.20]Three balls?
[144:13.22]Oh, what are these?
[144:14.62]Oh, I like those.
[144:16.07]What do they do?
[144:16.89]The fire feet.
[144:18.95]Well, these, you can't pick up familiars.
[144:21.39]That doesn't seem like very much of a downside considering the familiars.
[144:23.69]Yeah, I never pick them up anyway.
[144:25.35]I imagine if you're playing alone, it's just annoying when they hit your friend.
[144:40.50]Let's go, demon!
[144:42.20]Let's go, let's be friends forever!
[144:43.82]Kinda looks like you.
[144:49.75]The demon?
[144:50.71]Yeah.
[144:52.17]Oh yeah, look.
[144:53.61]It's a spinning image.
[144:54.60]Okay.
[144:59.07]Kill him.
[144:59.69]I want you to get all the kills so we can see.
[145:01.35]Immortality.
[145:02.57]Oh, so that's what that means.
[145:03.65]So that's the max level demon.
[145:05.71]I guess.
[145:07.31]You now cannot die.
[145:09.40]So go die.
[145:10.00]These fireballs are homing.
[145:12.72]Let's see what happens.
[145:13.82]Take a killing blow.
[145:15.34]See if it consumes the demon.
[145:18.68]I don't want to waste my demon, though.
[145:20.48]Well, I thought we were done playing.
[145:22.56]We just wanted to see what he did.
[145:23.77]I guess.
[145:24.77]Well, let's go into an area where we can see my character, then.
[145:29.87]Sure.
[145:31.21]That makes sense.
[145:33.37]Well, no, it says right now I have two lives.
[145:36.41]And I'm getting another demon after that.
[145:38.83]This guy seems really strong.
[145:40.49]Yeah, that seems crazy.
[145:42.02]So yeah, I'm gonna assume it just resurrects me when I die, because I have the two hearts.
[145:50.44]Can't pick that up.
[145:51.44]Health potion down there.
[145:56.90]Yeah, that's probably...
[145:59.14]40 health is bad, but who actually cares?
[146:02.46]Hey, how about, like, you kind of want to finish playing, let's just, like, let's run through all these areas and try and see if we can be fast people.
[146:09.47]Okay.
[146:12.25]Whoops.
[146:13.65]I was told to run.
[146:14.99]I was picking up that potion.
[146:16.33]Big chest here.
[146:17.03]Oh yeah, let's get this chest and then run, because this is, like, the only big chest that's ever in this area.
[146:35.52]I just twirled you off, didn't I?
[146:37.42]Yep, you did.
[146:40.44]See ya.
[146:41.23]That was not even on purpose.
[146:44.69]Well, I'm alive.
[146:45.33]Okay, well, hi.
[146:50.81]Is this us going fast?
[146:53.27]Yeah, this is us going- Oh my god.
[146:56.30]God, would you- Was that your Santa Claus?
[146:59.44]No, my Santa Claus wouldn't do that to you.
[147:02.70]He's no dick.
[147:08.52]This is going really well.
[147:11.74]What's this?
[147:13.84]So fast.
[147:15.15]So fast.
[147:16.01]I just saw in the chat.
[147:17.69]That's permanent.
[147:18.89]Oh no, that's seven rooms.
[147:22.15]Never mind, I'm just so fast.
[147:24.23]Let's go.
[147:26.19]Skip this room.
[147:28.14]Test.
[147:30.70]Skip it.
[147:31.76]But what if it was in there?
[147:34.62]By the way, you going fast, I'm never going to come back to life.
[147:40.04]Okay, I'll get you back to life and I'll grow my demon.
[147:45.30]You can't- I thought you didn't want to play, that's what this is about.
[147:50.34]You do, but like I'm trying to be like the good friend and look out for you.
[147:54.98]You're trying to kill me.
[147:58.16]Bleh, I'm a demon.
[148:00.35]I'm also a demon.
[148:01.37]Oh, I'm Jerma, I'm gonna drink the murky water.
[148:03.41]Haha, you have an ass for a face.
[148:06.83]Oh my god.
[148:12.59]Play cards.
[148:14.95]This run would probably be a really good one too.
[148:23.55]Geez.
[148:27.41]Well there's a bunch of explosions, look out!
[148:37.87]I'm just, look how big I am!
[148:39.77]Yeah, you're too big.
[148:47.95]Watch out, guy with the shield.
[148:49.63]Watch out, guy with the shield.
[148:52.66]I don't think it matters.
[148:53.64]I'm like the size of the screen.
[148:55.02]I think my demon's max level.
[149:01.98]Let's go.
[149:02.30]I don't need to wait for you.
[149:05.84]I'm dead.
[149:06.99]Oh my god.
[149:07.59]What killed me?
[149:08.89]I think my demon shot one of those- Oh, hi.
[149:15.83]A lot of bomb barrels.
[149:16.93]No, you're blowing them up by walking into them.
[149:19.71]Oh, yeah, that.
[149:21.33]They, like, weren't on the ground yet, though.
[149:23.31]They landed on me.
[149:25.55]What am I doing?
[149:26.15]I don't know.
[149:33.24]Let's go!
[149:33.72]Is there a reason why you're doing that?
[149:35.42]Let's go!
[149:44.97]Why are there- OH!
[149:46.79]My curse.
[149:47.69]I have a curse.
[149:50.45]I was gonna say... That is such a bad curse.
[150:02.13]Unless you had bomb immunity.
[150:03.49]It'd be really good.
[150:06.67]I can't pick them up or do anything with either.
[150:09.71]Whatever happened to us?
[150:10.75]Oh, we can't.
[150:11.79]No, we can't do that anymore.
[150:19.48]Dude, by now you could have like, unless there's a limit on demons.
[150:29.91]Bye.
[150:30.11]That's the dummy.
[150:41.46]You get it.
[150:44.44]You're the fucking dumb one here.
[150:50.59]Hey, you're the one that twirled me off this game.
[150:52.83]I'm not the dumb one this game.
[150:57.56]That was by far, like, the best magic.
[151:00.60]In terms of hitting things.
[151:03.10]Yeah, it is.
[151:07.49]How come you don't- where's your other demon?
[151:09.47]I died.
[151:09.73]Did you have, like, a second?
[151:10.59]Ah, that's right, you died.
[151:21.48]Shit.
[151:24.34]We actually are getting pretty far, considering how we're playing.
[151:34.16]Yeah, those trolls, if you do the dash attack into them, they like stumble backwards far enough to always fall off.
[151:44.74]I almost have two demons.
[151:48.04]Most.
[151:57.91]Get him.
[152:00.14]Throw him over here.
[152:01.80]Throw him over here.
[152:03.38]Play catch.
[152:07.20]You suck.
[152:10.13]I wasn't trying to throw him back to you.
[152:11.47]I just wanted to play catch.
[152:13.85]I suck.
[152:14.53]You almost just flew backwards.
[152:15.93]You're lucky.
[152:16.83]Open it.
[152:20.36]You wish you could do that.
[152:28.15]That's cute.
[152:32.84]Gonna take the shield breaker, or?
[152:36.90]Am I gonna take the shield breaker?
[152:38.32]I'll take the shield breaker, sure.
[152:45.33]God, that stupid fucking thing.
[152:50.13]Because I have things that automatically shoot.
[152:51.83]Yeah.
[152:53.31]And I am, my feet are on fire.
[152:56.22]Come on.
[152:59.41]There's so many ways for those to activate.
[153:00.73]Found one.
[153:04.03]Those things activating, there's a million and one ways for that.
[153:06.29]Oh, it gets rid of all of your demon progress when you die.
[153:07.85]It got rid of both of them.
[153:10.27]I wonder, maybe you get like a buff or something when it's all said and done.
[153:14.37]Maybe if we weren't playing like idiots, we'd find out.
[153:19.93]I just got like triple ran over.
[153:30.36]Small, tiny room.
[153:36.39]Oh, I came in.
[153:37.03]Hey, there's barrels.
[153:37.73]I'm dead again.
[153:41.85]Like, actually dead.
[153:42.33]That's good.
[153:47.27]I appreciate the help, but these guys are like little shit enemies.
[153:49.78]Yeah, I'm just gonna hang out.
[153:53.04]While he hits you to death.
[153:54.44]Yeah, I noticed.
[154:03.39]Like, didn't even happen.
[154:04.91]You're an old wise man.
[154:06.05]Oh, we got my hamburger.
[154:18.29]Only got to kill two, man.
[154:23.54]Welcome back to the living in two seconds.
[154:26.74]Yeah, the other demon wasn't finished, so maybe it would stay if...
[154:32.31]It was finished.
[154:32.99]I don't know.
[154:44.50]Wow.
[154:44.92]We're so good.
[154:48.38]Only had 11 minutes.
[154:50.18]I mean, if we actually get to the last boss, we might be able to do the 30 minute.
[154:54.84]Oh my god.
[154:55.68]Holy shit, dude.
[154:57.82]You died.
[155:02.78]Alright.
[155:03.78]Well, good.
[155:07.78]Don't worry about it.
[155:09.22]We might be able to do this in 30 minutes.
[155:17.14]You're kicking their ass.
[155:18.02]I need three more.
[155:18.70]One more.
[155:28.95]Why am I so flaccid today?
[155:31.63]I don't know.
[155:32.49]You're pretty flaccid.
[155:33.39]You know what I mean?
[155:36.19]It's like, get it up.
[155:40.42]Oh, I catch you.
[155:44.04]Is that what it's really like?
[155:46.96]What?
[155:48.08]Get it up.
[155:48.92]Like, everyone wants me to get it up.
[155:52.68]Oh, Christ.
[155:55.40]Otto.
[155:55.84]Otto did not like that.
[156:00.14]I almost let him hit me again.
[156:05.94]One of your barrels is bada- don't come over here yet.
[156:08.50]One of your stupid barrels is right when you're gonna jump.
[156:11.85]Okay, you're free to come over here.
[156:14.81]Ooh!
[156:16.13]Your thing hit me.
[156:18.39]Ooh!
[156:20.65]Oh, come on!
[156:23.75]Why'd you even walk near them?
[156:27.00]Because I wanted to open the chest, I was greedy.
[156:29.82]That's a new sword.
[156:36.60]Fiery weapon.
[156:38.20]You can be fireman.
[156:42.95]I guess we could use that somewhere.
[156:45.49]You take that scroll.
[156:51.51]I have 20 health.
[156:54.25]What is the deal here?
[156:56.43]There's another guy back there.
[156:57.55]You go kill him.
[157:03.88]Ato!
[157:04.93]Ato, I wanna go outside again- I thought that was you.
[157:08.29]I really thought that was you.
[157:10.15]I don't think he wants to go outside again, he's been out- I think- do you want a snack?
[157:15.09]You want a snack, dog?
[157:15.75]I think he maybe just wants me to pay attention to him, because I'm not paying attention to him.
[157:21.47]And then he's down here, he's like, why are you not looking at me?
[157:26.26]I am like all fire, man.
[157:27.88]Hey.
[157:29.20]I'm looking at you right now, hi.
[157:36.62]What a whiny little dog.
[157:40.12]Don't say that about my dog, don't dare you!
[157:42.64]That's the funny, like, I hit my friend joke.
[157:44.74]Yeah, really funny.
[157:48.77]Alright, well, I'm gonna go see what he needs.
[157:51.49]Real funny.
[157:52.17]Hit my friend joke.
[157:53.23]Really funny.
[157:55.55]You can't control it.
[157:59.25]Come on, Otto!
[158:01.68]I can get it.
[158:06.18]Alright, after this room is clear, I need to go see what he wants.
[158:11.18]I'm going to go and go, hey, what do you want, Doug?
[158:14.54]What do you want?
[158:15.58]And he tells you?
[158:16.20]He goes, hey, I'm just kind of hungry.
[158:19.16]Can you give me a snack?
[158:27.13]Got it.
[158:32.12]This armor is going to carry me to the endgame.
[158:35.05]It's really, really broken.
[158:36.69]Don't.
[158:37.11]Be careful.
[158:37.65]I'll be back.
[158:38.93]Don't be careful.
[158:40.08]Be careful.
[158:41.32]Oh, let's go.
[158:42.80]It's the Wheel of Misfortune, dude.
[158:45.99]Well, you're gonna have to wait.
[158:47.03]Just hang out there and tell another funny story.
[158:49.21]Did you spin the wheel?
[158:50.67]No.
[158:51.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[158:52.93]Let me get in there.
[158:54.43]Oh, my God.
[158:55.61]Alright, I'll be right back.
[158:56.79]Okay, hurry up.
[158:57.67]Tell another story.
[158:58.27]Okay, guys, here's the story all about how I'm really thirsty.
[159:04.17]I'm gonna drink more lemonade.
[159:12.77]Is two health a lot in this game?
[159:13.85]Not really.
[159:14.27]Now, the reason this armor is so broken, as you can see at the top, I have four armor right now.
[159:18.99]I think it goes up to five.
[159:21.61]Every time you kill someone, you gain a durability back.
[159:25.96]Um... And every time you... Yeah, so you kill an enemy, you gain durability back, and you don't get hurt for each durability.
[159:33.42]So, like...
[159:36.52]You can keep this on forever and never actually take damage, even though it makes your health really, really low.
[159:42.18]So as long as I don't do anything stupid, I'll probably be fine.
[159:45.92]I already have a demon, so I have an extra life.
[159:48.37]Warlock seems really, really, like, hands down, without any question, the best class in the game.
[159:57.15]From what I've seen so far.
[160:00.07]Like, you can't die.
[160:08.70]Is that not a curse?
[160:09.56]I thought that was a curse the other day.
[160:11.32]Is it because he went AFK or something?
[160:14.28]I don't know.
[160:18.25]No, it's Lemonade.
[160:20.93]When will I play Nuclear Throne?
[160:22.17]I-Jerome said he was only gonna play for an hour.
[160:24.07]I don't know how long we've actually been playing.
[160:28.03]It's-it's certainly cut into my time.
[160:30.73]But I'm willing to stream.
[160:31.54]What time is it?
[160:34.98]10.30.
[160:36.26]I've really been wanting to go to bed early.
[160:59.13]Come on, dude.
[161:09.14]We've really been playing this for like three hours?
[161:14.29]That's the power of a game that you find fun.
[161:16.19]I actually had a dream the other day that Overwatch beta was leaked.
[161:22.36]Like it was like someone leaked like a fake version, like weird old version of Overwatch and Blizzard was like, no one's allowed to play this.
[161:28.06]Like we'll ban you from all Blizzard games if you play this beta.
[161:32.44]So I was playing it.
[161:35.22]The whole video was weird.
[161:36.24]I didn't want to make a video on it because Blizzard didn't want people to play it at all.
[161:41.72]So I felt guilty opening this hack to Overwatch client.
[161:44.85]And it wasn't even Overwatch.
[161:46.03]It was a third-person Tribes Ascend-style game.
[161:50.61]With this really, really broken wall running instead of Tribes how you surf.
[161:54.27]You could just zoom across the whole map.
[161:56.77]The point is... The point of this whole dream story...
[162:03.61]So I really want to play Overwatch.
[162:06.69]Dream Me was like so hype.
[162:08.75]It was all I wanted to do.
[162:09.79]And I was like, shh, they're not gonna fucking ban me.
[162:14.98]If they do it'll last for like a day.
[162:19.00]You can't ban me, dude.
[162:20.08]I don't know, didn't make any sense.
[162:24.24]It was a terrible story, but um... I'm excited for that game.
[162:28.98]Still.
[162:34.23]It is Labor Day tomorrow, yeah.
[162:39.73]I think that September 23rd beta thing was already, like, someone officially denied it from Blizzard.
[162:46.42]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[162:56.62]Man, I wanna...
[163:01.46]Am I bedtime enforced by the dork girl?
[163:03.22]No, she's the first offender to the bedtime ruiner.
[163:08.14]I'm the enforcer of the bedtime.
[163:10.66]I guess I messed it up last night by streaming too late.
[163:15.36]We've been good so far.
[163:16.34]Excited about Dark Souls 3.
[163:22.34]That's actually pretty soon.
[163:23.36]I am excited about it, but... I've gotten too good at not getting hyped about games.
[163:31.96]Video game hype is very dangerous.
[163:34.38]I'm just hitting L on one of his things.
[163:39.28]When was, uh, Dark Souls 3 actually?
[163:41.68]Was that November?
[163:42.80]Or what?
[163:52.41]Overwatch is supposed to come out... soon.
[163:58.95]It's in the realm of soon now.
[164:00.81]I'm still assuming it's gonna be in November.
[164:06.11]But they haven't really said anything new about it.
[164:15.98]Jerma left to- his dog was crying and he was like, I'm gonna go touch my dog.
[164:23.51]Or something.
[164:28.57]Whatever.
[164:34.49]Can't wait anymore.
[164:35.91]If we both die, I don't care.
[164:45.16]Oh, a free Guardian.
[164:49.10]If I take that, will that save me from losing one of my demons?
[164:54.48]I don't know.
[164:54.90]We'll find out.
[164:55.60]Oh, I can't take it because it's familiar.
[165:00.70]Charma!
[165:06.84]If it was the foot curse again, I'd lose my mind.
[165:13.26]You can't spin the wheel twice now.
[165:14.76]The door opens and everything's over after that.
[165:31.94]I was guessing... I guessed November 10th, and that's why it was the joke.
[165:36.03]Because it made sense as a date to begin with, so I just said fall 10th in the video, considering that November 10th probably was a pretty reasonable date.
[165:46.66]Blizzard lately has... Whenever they say something's coming out, like if you look back at Hearthstone, they said...
[165:54.80]Last expansion Grand Tournament.
[165:56.52]It's coming out in August!
[165:57.80]Of course they wait until the very end of August.
[166:00.52]So when they say fall, Overwatch Beta is in the fall, expect it to come out like November 29th.
[166:10.09]I think there'd be a lot of really upset people if it came out even like December 1st or something like that.
[166:16.13]It wasn't... When does fall end?
[166:20.65]That's not how it works.
[166:23.02]I was considering December 1st, the start of winter, but that's not how it actually works.
[166:27.50]I don't know.
[166:30.70]December 20th is the end of fall?
[166:32.44]Really?
[166:32.68]Someone just said December 20th.
[166:37.62]I don't even know if that's in response to that question yet.
[166:39.85]I don't know.
[166:43.45]Yeah, okay, it is December 20th.
[166:45.83]That's odd.
[166:47.79]Alright, well, we just confirmed it then.
[166:49.49]Overwatch beta for December 10th.
[167:02.27]The Yogscast?
[167:03.79]I don't know why everyone's taking the Yogscast as the most credible source for Overwatch beta.
[167:15.30]Dude, Yogcast said it.
[167:17.72]Blizzard Activision is going to listen to them.
[167:20.10]They make YouTube videos.
[167:34.87]Come on- I'm playing the game, fuck him.
[167:40.63]I already... ...walked on- I'm an idiot?
[167:46.05]I'm going to die and I don't care!
[167:47.43]It's like it's about time- my title has said for a long time now... ...that I'm gonna play... ...Nuclear Throne.
[167:56.15]I know there's been people that have been waiting for that, so I don't care if I die.
[168:05.50]I would love for this network desync to come off my screen though.
[168:24.68]I can't see anything!
[168:29.46]Pretty please.
[168:33.26]Ah, and that's the end of the level.
[168:34.42]Like, Jerma needs to come back and get that Guardian.
[168:36.62]I'm gonna, like, be sad if he doesn't.
[168:43.17]Yeah, 30 minute completion run.
[168:44.43]Yeah, that's out the window.
[168:45.61]I forgot about that.
[168:46.39]Fuck him.
[168:49.66]This is a single player run now.
[168:53.96]I have to cl- He has- HE HAS TO BE HERE!
[169:14.35]This is the moment I realized Jerma's dog is more important than me.
[169:19.43]So, I guess we're just gonna leave the game and go play Nuclear Throne.
[169:30.20]Alright.
[169:34.30]Okay.
[169:34.54]I'm gonna change my stream title.
[170:03.96]I don't even want to hear it.
[170:04.82]I close the game.
[170:13.14]Wow, abandoning Jerma.
[170:15.20]It could be looked at that way.
[170:16.38]And that's how he's going to look at it.
[170:17.54]Alright.
[170:22.27]Let's put this controller away.
[170:28.35]That's usually when you expect someone to come back right that second.
[170:30.73]Like, oh, I'm back.
[170:31.45]What happened?
[170:38.95]Is that set up right?
[170:39.75]We good?
[170:42.84]Good for some nuclear throwing dudes.
[170:50.32]Um, I guess I'm just gonna... Hold on, I have to get back in the game.
[170:54.10]Uh, I guess I'm just gonna do the daily and see what's new and... I don't think I'm gonna play too much.
[171:02.48]We played that game way longer than I expected to.
[171:04.62]So...
[171:10.70]I'm just kinda gonna wanna die.
[171:12.26]I think I haven't been playing much Nuclear Throne lately in general.
[171:18.20]I think it's the frickin' options now.
[171:23.03]Can't get it from there.
[171:38.29]We good?
[171:39.85]We good?
[171:41.16]Is horror viable?
[171:42.10]Horror is still one of the best characters.
[171:44.86]Maybe second best now behind Chicken, but Chicken got nerfed a little bit.
[171:48.18]Horror is very, very good.
[171:49.22]I don't know what I want to play.
[171:51.66]I think they buffed Fish's throne butt roll a little bit, which is pointless, but Fish is my man, so we're going to play Fish.
[172:04.85]Oh, not that one.
[172:09.48]They changed it a lot in today's patch.
[172:13.38]I haven't played this in hella long.
[172:16.40]They made it so loops aren't gimmick messes, which I've complained about since this game for a very long time.
[172:25.40]They kind of normalized loop enemies.
[172:30.70]And they fixed the throne boss.
[172:35.75]Fix something else big, I don't know.
[172:37.87]The loot thing is the thing that matters, so hopefully we don't die.
[172:40.17]Did you, like, beat the level?
[172:42.87]Um, I got so bored.
[172:44.59]I beat the level, I went out the door, and I still had to wait for you to press X, so I quit playing.
[172:51.93]You quit the game?
[172:52.63]I'm playing Nuclear Throne now, yeah.
[172:55.15]Oh.
[172:55.65]You were gone for a very long time.
[172:58.15]Uh, I'm sorry, the dog needed to be attended to.
[173:01.93]Yeah.
[173:03.48]Now people are accusing me of abandoning you.
[173:06.79]Oh, you kind of did.
[173:09.41]I believe it to be quite the opposite.
[173:10.95]That's kind of unnecessary, what you did.
[173:15.71]What did you even do with Otto?
[173:17.65]Took him out, and then I gave him some food.
[173:20.23]You've never done that for me before.
[173:24.77]Yeah, you're right.
[173:25.71]I've never taken you out on a leash so you could poo in the background.
[173:29.13]No, you've never taken me out to a nice restaurant and eaten.
[173:33.57]We have.
[173:36.37]Confirmed it here.
[173:37.99]We've been out before, like... Confirmed on stream, JermaSTERMA.
[173:40.79]Whatever you say.
[173:52.86]I like the way I said that.
[173:53.82]It had a good ring to it.
[173:56.34]So you're still playing?
[173:58.31]Yeah.
[173:59.39]Okay, have fun.
[174:01.03]Dude, I got a guardian angel on the ground for you there, too, because I rolled the wheel.
[174:07.17]I can't go backwards.
[174:08.77]You completed the level.
[174:09.85]Oh, yeah.
[174:10.95]Well, that's what it was.
[174:12.07]It wasn't speed or anything.
[174:13.83]Yeah, well, good luck.
[174:15.43]I mean, I was really, really strong, and I had a lot going for me.
[174:19.19]But it's just like my friend was just like, I don't think we're done now.
[174:23.63]I think more priority is to... And I have to pay attention because I'm on the daily run for Nuke Throne.
[174:31.59]So I don't want to die like a noob, you know what I mean?
[174:33.59]Have you ever been a noob before?
[174:36.32]Oh yeah.
[174:40.04]Of course I have.
[174:41.94]Have you?
[174:43.60]No.
[174:46.22]That is such a star thing to say.
[174:55.16]Right in front of your mics.
[174:57.18]You want one of these?
[175:02.04]No?
[175:03.84]What is it?
[175:07.24]Pretty good.
[175:07.88]Can I judge your chip choice?
[175:09.10]What is it?
[175:11.35]You know what I really like recently?
[175:12.67]Let's talk more about you.
[175:15.03]Sure.
[175:20.04]I forget what show I was watching that was like a very British show and in Britland they call Like I think it was cookies and that kind of stuff they call them biscuits like a cookie is a biscuit Right, and I think I'm adopting that into my life Because calling like a cookie a biscuit makes you feel like way less of a fat fuck.
[175:45.97]Like, I'm gonna treat myself with a biscuit right now, and then it feels, like, light, and, like, I'm just, like, having one.
[175:50.69]I'm just having a biscuit real quick.
[175:54.71]Yeah.
[175:56.71]Although, then, you can't say, what, are you gonna have biscuits and gravy?
[175:59.98]What do you say, I'm gonna have cookies and gravy?
[176:02.22]No, you don't reverse those words.
[176:04.14]Why not?
[176:05.06]You're a fool!
[176:12.58]Okay, I really need to pay attention.
[176:20.72]I would like to not die.
[176:21.90]Well, apparently vans also don't run you over every 10 seconds in loops.
[176:26.76]That'll be neat to see.
[176:44.68]Like, what are these awful weapons I'm finding?
[176:50.41]Yes, there's vultures.
[176:51.43]If you haven't seen this game before, people would compare it to, because it has to be compared to other games.
[176:57.25]Hotline Miami, Binding of Isaac.
[177:00.51]You die very, very, very, very quickly.
[177:02.53]You go through levels, kill bosses.
[177:07.38]Level up.
[177:08.94]Become a hero.
[177:11.22]Get mutations.
[177:13.32]Listen to somebody's chips.
[177:15.24]Yeah.
[177:19.65]Yeah.
[177:20.74]Okay.
[177:23.20]Alright, I'll, uh, I'll relay the information to him.
[177:27.36]Okay.
[177:28.80]Yeah, Star, sorry.
[177:29.60]Uh, you gotta stop playing Nuclear Throne.
[177:32.08]Why?
[177:33.69]Obama just called me.
[177:35.51]Oh, shit.
[177:36.37]Again?
[177:36.73]Heard he was playing Nuclear Throne.
[177:38.71]Uh, that's gotta stop.
[177:39.97]He's gotta get back on, uh, Rampage from his friend.
[177:43.09]And, uh, make sure...
[177:45.73]And he finds that item that he dropped.
[177:47.93]Okay, have a nice day.
[177:49.55]And I hung up and I was like, oh my god, I was just a pregnant!
[177:53.22]And if he is going to play Nuclear Throne, please play Meltem.
[177:56.34]It's my favorite character.
[177:58.18]No, he's not playing Meltem.
[178:01.90]I don't know why.
[178:04.02]That's it.
[178:05.74]That's it.
[178:10.34]Obama's back from Nippon.
[178:13.44]Nippon.
[178:14.46]Excuse me.
[178:15.52]I haven't brushed up on my French.
[178:17.14]Hello, Otto.
[178:21.66]How's life?
[178:24.64]Yeah, yeah.
[178:25.58]For a guy who, like, loves his dog more than me, like, wow.
[178:29.37]Like, wow.
[178:30.05]Like, wow.
[178:30.47]Like, likes his dog.
[178:31.53]Like, wouldn't sell his dog for any amount of money, as we've determined.
[178:35.65]How much would you sell me for?
[178:38.60]Terrorists have me, and you have to give them money.
[178:42.80]Oh, no, no.
[178:47.04]Wait, no, wait, no.
[178:48.27]Wait, no, it was the other way around.
[178:50.49]You are my captor, and you have the choice to sell me to terrorists.
[178:57.85]I'm ready to go.
[178:59.55]So I've got you, and I'm literally getting phone calls to the highest bidder, people that want to pay me for you.
[179:05.99]You can pretty much sell me for any amount that you want.
[179:13.62]That's a test.
[179:14.08]You know what?
[179:15.66]No, I couldn't.
[179:16.52]I don't think I could.
[179:17.34]It would have to be... No, I don't think I could do that.
[179:20.82]It would have to be probably like a couple hundred dollars.
[179:27.00]Well, that means you could do that.
[179:29.54]That was a joke.
[179:30.20]We got that one.
[179:33.72]Just fucking hide behind your jokes like you always do.
[179:41.55]I like that.
[179:51.03]What's new?
[179:56.13]I'm dying.
[179:56.79]I don't have, whatchamacallit yet, any sort of health ability.
[180:04.57]A couple hundred for Ster, I'll take 20.
[180:06.17]There we are.
[180:07.77]Here's where I'd say, you know, you have the, I would never, absolutely not, and then the, I'm listening.
[180:14.06]So the, I'm listening, is when someone would be like, five million.
[180:19.17]That's when I'm like, I'm listening.
[180:21.52]Yeah, but that doesn't that doesn't mean it's gonna happen.
[180:23.46]That doesn't mean like the big scary guy.
[180:26.08]They need to add sweeteners.
[180:27.18]If I learn anything from TF2 trading is you add big five million and then you have to add.
[180:31.70]Where's ads?
[180:32.35]Give ads.
[180:33.51]Like Mayor McCheese calls me and he's like, I demand star.
[180:36.99]I will pay any top dollar.
[180:39.15]Any top dollar.
[180:40.33]He says five million.
[180:41.19]I go, I'm listening.
[180:43.31]And then it better be way more than that.
[180:45.73]That I'm listening is like you've got kind of kind of my attention.
[180:50.60]Not really, though.
[180:52.92]That's going to go up to like 100 million.
[180:56.54]What do you do with 100 million dollars?
[180:59.19]Hire a team of extremely good... Certain skills.
[181:05.15]Yeah, I would hire a bunch of Navy SEALs to go get you.
[181:08.13]And that probably wouldn't be more than 10 million.
[181:09.95]So then we'd split the 80, 90 million.
[181:14.35]Okay, no.
[181:14.85]The people who are buying me, like the terrorists, they say within five minutes of acquiring me, they're going to kill me.
[181:21.49]No.
[181:23.42]No, of course not.
[181:24.62]Absolutely not.
[181:26.00]But it's death by snoo-snoo.
[181:29.12]What?
[181:31.31]I mean, there's some consideration there.
[181:33.39]If Mayor McCheese calls, no.
[181:36.41]I would hand you over to Mayor McCheese, not some organization.
[181:40.59]I think I could do away with you for 15 grand.
[181:43.19]No way.
[181:55.69]I love this weapon.
[181:57.55]Doesn't get enough love.
[181:59.29]Gotta love it.
[182:00.65]You know that's, um, that's Jay-Z's weakness?
[182:04.57]Love?
[182:07.10]I left, I came back, and now you're like a weirdo.
[182:09.20]What happened?
[182:10.00]What?
[182:10.20]What are you talking about?
[182:12.40]You're talking about like Jay-Z?
[182:13.98]You're talking about like selling me to like the... Come on, man, what happened to you?
[182:18.61]I'm just talking about his weakness.
[182:24.34]Death by Snoo Snoo.
[182:28.69]I love... I love South Park.
[182:31.65]Futurama, you fuck!
[182:33.35]No, that's a South Park joke.
[182:34.63]I love South Park.
[182:35.95]That's a great joke.
[182:40.34]I feel like the last time you did this joke, I was playing Nuclear Throne.
[182:43.88]So it's kind of special.
[182:44.76]I love that show.
[182:48.44]I love that Family Guy.
[182:49.40]That's a great show.
[182:51.96]Death by Snoo Snoo's Family Guy is a great show.
[182:55.53]That, like, pisses people off, you know?
[182:57.18]Like, when you give something credit that, like, really doesn't deserve it.
[183:00.18]It doesn't even matter if they're, like, a fan of one or the other.
[183:02.24]It's like, dude, like, when you know that that's not where that's from, I'm, like, really mad now.
[183:07.56]Oh, I know.
[183:08.72]I'm aware.
[183:09.26]I know.
[183:11.48]I'm just saying.
[183:11.98]That's, like, that's such an unusual way to, like, guarantee to really piss somebody off.
[183:18.76]Yeah.
[183:20.48]I know.
[183:22.68]I know!
[183:23.06]I'm just saying it's funny!
[183:25.34]I know, I got you.
[183:27.26]Yeah, you know!
[183:27.94]Hey, got ya.
[183:31.22]Sing bibbidi-bop-bop-bee-zip-bop-boom.
[183:33.00]That was another one.
[183:35.23]Dude, this guy has too many zips.
[183:37.45]I got way too many zips and zops.
[183:39.11]Come on.
[183:49.33]What's your favorite zip?
[183:55.84]Yeah, I thought so.
[184:01.79]Use the Force, Harry.
[184:02.95]Gandalf.
[184:07.99]That's great.
[184:09.59]Use the Force, Harry.
[184:10.81]Oh, that was a quote by Gandalf.
[184:15.35]I'm already mad.
[184:21.69]Wow, this sucks.
[184:23.30]Why are there so many?
[184:33.61]So much ammo on that I Like don't like the light the this gun anymore.
[184:43.06]Yeah energy.
[184:45.22]I can't say words right now.
[184:46.58]Fuck I was really tired like three hours ago when you asked me to play that game and now I'm like beyond tired
[185:00.28]The bullet spread on this is like, it's not worth it for me.
[185:03.44]But I felt like people were going to complain that I... I don't know.
[185:07.18]Chat runs my life.
[185:10.68]They're like, why are you still using the energy pistol?
[185:12.04]There was a minigun.
[185:12.82]Because the scum is... In the long run, because I'm probably going to get fish's thing where I don't use ammo.
[185:19.25]Like, yeah, this will be fine.
[185:21.13]But right now, I'm not happy with my life.
[185:24.05]So I moved.
[185:26.43]That's pretty good.
[185:28.44]I found like a good week, Jerma.
[185:29.72]Have you?
[185:32.32]Yeah.
[185:33.14]That's good.
[185:35.52]I found the secret path today.
[185:36.85]Secret path.
[185:39.67]We got 666 kills right now.
[185:40.93]That's a lot.
[185:45.35]Yeah.
[185:45.77]For someone like you.
[186:10.58]Dormitoo quiet?
[186:11.30]That's because he's shy.
[186:12.06]Yeah.
[186:14.84]Yeah, that's why.
[186:19.50]Shoutout to Star for his good week.
[186:21.88]Thanks, dude.
[186:27.87]I actually, like... I actually really enjoyed moving.
[186:32.77]Like, the whole, like, lifting boxes and... It's, like, a lot of work.
[186:37.63]But, like, just getting out was fun for me.
[186:43.44]Being in this place is just very different.
[186:47.25]Jerm is up to something.
[186:50.63]You kind of sound like you are.
[186:52.27]Why am I up to something?
[186:53.27]What do I do?
[186:53.63]I don't know, but you definitely are.
[186:58.79]I can take a Super Bazooka.
[187:01.75]What am I up to?
[187:04.99]I don't want to take the Super Bazooka.
[187:07.72]I was thinking about going to get some food.
[187:09.08]Did I take the super bazooka?
[187:13.32]I don't think I need it.
[187:17.43]Shout out to Star for dealing with Jerma, thank you.
[187:20.39]What?
[187:21.35]What?
[187:22.37]Come on now.
[187:24.17]Dealing with me?
[187:25.89]It's the other way around.
[187:26.71]I have to deal with him.
[187:34.90]Sure.
[187:37.08]Just put everything on me.
[187:38.82]Yeah.
[187:40.20]Just fucking lean back and, like, rely on your jokes like you always do.
[187:46.66]Watch this.
[187:51.69]Try and have a real conversation, like, okay, like, keep doing your jokes.
[188:01.93]This is a relaxation hotline.
[188:03.59]Yeah, I think I do.
[188:10.08]I'm sad I didn't make a Dark Souls video just because there's no relaxation hotline in video format.
[188:16.62]Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[188:18.04]But whatever.
[188:19.00]I might go back and get just that.
[188:20.86]Oh my god, it's pulling my gun.
[188:22.96]It does that now?
[188:25.26]Never used to do that.
[188:26.76]Okay, oh, that's big.
[188:27.84]Apparently this boss is different now too, so get ready for whatever's different here.
[188:35.36]And by that I mean, get hype!
[188:38.36]Yeah.
[188:42.62]Wow, that boss was really different.
[188:53.88]Oh, what are those?
[188:54.68]Oh, those are the maggot shooters on loop.
[188:58.12]Because loops are different now.
[188:59.80]Okay, now's where we get into some of the new content.
[189:02.08]You guys here just spec out some of this new content.
[189:04.59]You're trying to do good on today's daily.
[189:06.19]You want to see what you're in for, dude.
[189:08.07]This is what you're going to be up against.
[189:09.71]You got some guys up at the top.
[189:10.93]You got some vans coming in?
[189:12.83]No, those aren't.
[189:13.43]That's a fucking van!
[189:16.63]Calm down.
[189:18.62]No, that really actually kind of sucked.
[189:22.17]I couldn't tell which one was the van.
[189:23.45]I'm sorry.
[189:23.83]I'm not used to my mic yet either.
[189:25.57]Like, that yelling is probably really loud.
[189:27.07]I gotta learn how to, like, be a normal guy.
[189:32.63]I don't know if these are giving you, like, free kills on those maggots or not.
[189:44.17]That's cool that they're here now, though.
[189:45.25]I always thought those enemies, like the enemies that show up in some of the secret areas, would be awesome to see in loops, because they're just pretty badass.
[189:57.79]Yeah.
[189:59.07]Vans do 20- yeah, Vans didn't insta-kill me that time.
[190:01.46]Alright, chat.
[190:06.54]Time for what should I eat for food.
[190:08.20]It's a game show.
[190:12.14]Should I eat salmon?
[190:16.56]Grill it up?
[190:18.28]Nice and sweet?
[190:20.70]Should I eat hummus with some pita bread?
[190:28.12]Or... What else do I have?
[190:32.07]Buffalo chicken tenders?
[190:33.13]Lean into one of those.
[190:38.27]Eggs?
[190:39.21]I got plenty of eggs.
[190:40.77]Plenty of eggs.
[190:41.37]Dude has plenty of them.
[190:44.46]Dude, I need to get, like, tomorrow apparently was supposed to be really hot or something.
[190:47.28]I need to actually get, like, some stuff to cook tomorrow.
[190:52.68]Maybe, like, the first time I actually cooked in my kitchen besides the artichokes that I totally butchered.
[190:56.70]That doesn't count.
[190:57.94]Captain Crunch, also, by the way, that's on the menu.
[191:04.90]That's saying chicken, too.
[191:05.73]That's so, like...
[191:10.64]I need a lot of, uh, I need a lot of eggs.
[191:14.15]You know what?
[191:15.01]That does sound nice.
[191:15.77]Yeah, it kinda does.
[191:16.97]A couple of over-easy eggs?
[191:20.15]That doesn't sound bad at all.
[191:22.07]Like, like a nice, a nice brinner.
[191:25.68]Uh, that's, this wouldn't even be dinner.
[191:28.26]This is more like a, like a brack, like a snack breakfast.
[191:32.26]Oh, and just some, just some eggs?
[191:34.65]Just a couple of eggs, that's it.
[191:45.04]How dare you not having Captain Crunch for every meal, Jerma?
[191:50.40]Captain Crunch is great.
[191:51.82]I'd love that stuff.
[191:53.63]I will absolutely be like a 60 year old man and still eat Captain Crunch.
[191:58.19]I don't see why I wouldn't stop.
[192:02.02]don't eat it all the time but like if somebody if I'm in a room and I'm kind of hungry somebody walks up to me and they say hey would you like some captain crunch I'm just like you know what abso-fucking-lutely absolutely I would love some of that that'd be weird gotta admit well no it's like I knew obviously I just don't know the person
[192:24.20]So, when are you coming over here for some Cap'n Crunch?
[192:27.08]Cap'n Crunch omelette.
[192:29.48]Oh god, that'd be... That'd be gross.
[192:34.62]Cap'n Crunch does not cut the roof of your mouth.
[192:36.48]I've been eating it for years.
[192:37.56]It's never happened once.
[192:38.82]Except for that one time.
[192:42.20]And that was my own fault.
[192:51.87]I was playing a game.
[192:52.77]How much Captain Crunch can I fit in my mouth at the same time?
[192:57.41]That's not a fun game to play.
[192:58.41]Don't play that game.
[193:03.09]Don't ever play that game.
[193:05.03]This area is definitely harder than normal.
[193:07.04]I am in some shit right now, man.
[193:28.03]dog food?
[193:28.93]No.
[193:30.55]This isn't like a challenge!
[193:34.51]Yeah, it's like, hey, what's the grossest thing I can eat?
[193:44.98]Oh, that!
[193:46.34]I tried to fit between those.
[193:49.28]I kind of wasn't expecting all the things that were in there.
[193:57.66]funny stuff people are writing some weird funny thing loops are definitely different I was just playing my game man you know how I am dog food and captain crunch omelette yikes shout out to germans dog for eating dog food he eats pretty good dog food I buy him like the best I can buy pretty much he's my best friend of course I would
[194:26.90]That was fast.
[194:32.86]Actually, I want um... Jeremiah, all your opinions are wrong.
[194:51.59]How does that make you feel?
[194:52.67]That I just said your opinions are wrong?
[194:55.61]I disagree with you.
[194:57.28]You made me so angry.
[195:02.44]So then I had to disagree with you about stuff too.
[195:05.14]No!
[195:05.75]Big fight.
[195:07.03]No!
[195:07.87]Dude.
[195:08.93]Yeah, and then no one's happy.
[195:11.01]I am.
[195:14.56]I'm really sad they nerfed Fisch, by the way.
[195:17.47]His ultramutation.
[195:20.13]I was like the fucking only person that abused it.
[195:24.37]And only one weapon is actually good with it.
[195:26.97]Like, that weapon should have been taken out of the game instead of Fisch getting nerfed.
[195:33.35]IMO.
[195:34.61]It's openly rude to start.
[195:41.16]Jerma, are you excited for Dark Souls 3?
[195:43.82]Yeah.
[195:44.08]Do you actually care?
[195:45.34]Yeah, I mean, if it's more like Bloodborne, which it looks like it is, then absolutely.
[195:55.95]I'm excited to see what, like, the weapon skills are.
[195:58.63]Jerma, what's the grossest thing you would do for Cap'n Crunch?
[196:01.23]Nothing.
[196:01.61]I'd go buy a box for $3.
[196:02.95]So that's that answer.
[196:14.02]Yep.
[196:17.78]You should treat yourself to a nice serving of macaroni and cheese mixed with salsa on queso.
[196:21.07]I actually haven't had it.
[196:23.11]With a tortilla- that, you know... If I had salsa, that doesn't sound too terrible.
[196:28.83]That sounds pretty good.
[196:31.78]That's discussing.
[196:34.54]You're dissing and cussing.
[196:41.91]The sweet rads.
[196:43.33]Generic store brand crunch?
[196:44.61]No, no way.
[196:45.25]It's got to be the real deal.
[196:46.93]I've eaten all the off-brand cereals, they're just not the same.
[196:50.47]Have you?
[196:50.87]It's got to be the real deal.
[196:51.83]Oh, yeah.
[196:54.89]You like the cartoons?
[196:57.41]I've eaten the store brand versus, well, not store brand, like the...
[197:02.98]the generic brand, just generic.
[197:05.80]Versus the real deal.
[197:07.24]I like generic Frosted Flakes.
[197:09.76]Come at me.
[197:11.30]They're like the same.
[197:13.20]Those are probably pretty similar.
[197:19.49]So come at me.
[197:21.21]What's another one that the generic brand is just not even close?
[197:24.39]Oh, what is it?
[197:27.25]Maybe Smacks?
[197:28.12]Isn't there like a generic Smacks that's not that good at all?
[197:30.62]Like the real deal Smacks are the good ones.
[197:33.02]I think I've had generic smacks, too, in Arrow, right?
[197:35.40]Really?
[197:36.92]I have no problem with generic shit, though.
[197:39.43]I'm actually a huge supporter of the generic brands.
[197:44.31]You know, don't, like, don't ask me to testify.
[197:47.33]Fuck you, off-brander.
[197:49.69]That's when you hang up, right?
[197:50.61]No.
[197:53.35]That was a good place to hang up, but it didn't... Fuck you, off-brander!
[198:08.03]There actually are a couple of generic brands that are kind of good for various things, not necessarily cereal.
[198:17.82]That's such a vague fucking statement.
[198:21.14]There are some generic brands for some things that are good.
[198:24.47]Foods, like generic... Like pizza, like frozen pizzas.
[198:31.35]Yeah.
[198:33.01]There's like generic frozen pizza brands.
[198:35.55]Usually they're pretty good.
[198:36.79]Sometimes they're even better than the other ones.
[198:40.51]Most frozen pizzas are gross.
[198:44.22]Hold on just a second.
[198:45.82]Hold your horses there, sir.
[198:47.02]What did you just say?
[198:47.82]Have you ever had Dr. Oetker's?
[198:49.90]I don't believe I have.
[198:51.22]You've never had Dr. Oetker's frozen pizzas?
[198:54.83]I don't know.
[198:55.43]I'd know if I saw the box, but I don't think I have.
[198:58.33]It doesn't sound very familiar.
[199:00.93]Dr. Oetker's?
[199:02.84]is pretty damn good.
[199:05.66]Alright.
[199:06.52]I might just be a connoisseur of that type of like crispy thin crust frozen pizzas.
[199:14.12]I might just like it.
[199:15.44]I really liked those for a while.
[199:17.33]Maybe it was even Dr. Okra's.
[199:19.05]I don't know because I really don't even remember what the brand was.
[199:21.63]I did like them for a while but like...
[199:26.12]Doctor, uh, it's just... We're talking about frozen pizzas.
[199:29.44]I've never had a frozen pizza that was as good as Dr. Oaker's.
[199:32.04]And yes, Dr. Oaker's is a brand name, but we were just in the middle of talking about bread pizza.
[199:36.75]What's he a doctor of?
[199:37.35]I don't know.
[199:38.61]He's probably like a heart surgeon.
[199:39.93]I don't know.
[199:40.51]He's probably like a weight loss guy.
[199:42.27]Who knows?
[199:42.69]He's a doctor.
[199:43.35]Trust him.
[199:46.39]Was this pizza?
[199:48.61]Oh my god.
[199:49.50]I need to get a new chair.
[199:51.32]As soon as I sort out my address, I'm ordering another Staples hiking chair.
[199:58.96]If you put it in the oven, don't put it in the microwave.
[200:01.16]You don't do that with a Dr. Oakers.
[200:04.84]You put that thing on the middle rack in the oven and you follow directions.
[200:09.24]It is extremely good.
[200:14.44]Jeremy the fucking salesman strikes again.
[200:16.66]How many people are going to go out?
[200:18.49]I will be the salesman for things that are actually good, that I really like.
[200:23.09]I'll talk about Captain Crunch.
[200:25.31]I'll talk about Dr. Oakers.
[200:28.37]I actually physically like them.
[200:35.30]Dr. Oakers, if you're listening right now, you've got some great pizza.
[200:39.08]We'll talk.
[200:42.48]He just laughs.
[200:43.44]No, he won't.
[200:47.29]It's like, are you serious?
[200:48.59]Fuck off, dude.
[200:49.23]I'm not gonna sponsor you.
[200:50.85]You suck.
[200:53.91]Who is this fucking loser?
[200:56.73]You're gonna try to talk to me, Dr. Oatker?
[200:59.16]Do you know who the fuck I am?
[201:01.14]This is like a list of the best mutations in the game.
[201:03.46]I don't know what I want to do.
[201:07.02]I gotta spell it.
[201:08.56]I'm seeing all kinds of spellings.
[201:09.70]I gotta make sure people get the right one.
[201:11.12]Well, kinda.
[201:11.89]Kinda the best.
[201:13.97]These are all very good.
[201:15.31]It's, let's see, let me make sure that's the right way, because I don't know.
[201:18.81]Yes, I do.
[201:21.32]This is it.
[201:23.44]This is how you spell it, for those of you that were curious.
[201:27.46]Dr. Oetkers.
[201:29.62]He's a pizza doctor.
[201:36.09]He's a pizza, he's a doctor of pizzas.
[201:41.85]Yeah.
[201:46.30]Fuck it.
[201:47.24]And back muscle.
[201:49.10]No.
[201:51.48]Yes.
[201:52.34]Yes.
[201:52.62]I might go make one right now.
[201:53.60]I have one more in my freezer.
[202:09.87]Hold on.
[202:10.99]Dr. Ochre sells cereal too.
[202:14.55]I might have to give it a try.
[202:19.24]No joke.
[202:20.04]He, like, invented baking powder.
[202:24.23]That's fucking awesome.
[202:27.25]Dr. Oetker apparently, like, created baking powder.
[202:31.33]See?
[202:31.73]You can trust him.
[202:32.39]Okay.
[202:33.24]How old is the dude?
[202:34.24]He's like the grandfather.
[202:35.58]He's probably dead.
[202:37.60]Wow.
[202:38.02]That's too dark.
[202:38.62]I don't want to eat it anymore.
[202:40.04]You don't invent baking powder and still be alive.
[202:43.34]That was back in, like, 1910.
[202:46.33]Or something.
[202:46.81]Who knows?
[202:47.09]Let's find out.
[202:49.35]And he's been making frozen pizzas for that long?
[202:51.53]Do they even have refrigeration?
[202:54.07]No, no, he was like a pudding guy.
[202:55.37]He's a pudding guy.
[202:56.08]So why have they put his, like, would he be pissed off if he knew his name was on a frozen pizza?
[203:06.92]Probably.
[203:09.78]He probably!
[203:10.90]Holy shit, it really is Dr. Oaker. 1903.
[203:16.58]They're using me for fucking frozen pizza.
[203:19.12]How dare they.
[203:20.63]Can I get some fucking shotgun shells over here, dude?
[203:25.25]August Oetker.
[203:27.81]See, and you guys didn't think you could trust him.
[203:31.47]Or trust his, like, 17th grandson that's using his aim.
[203:34.74]Really, really, when was he born?
[203:41.69]I don't know.
[203:41.97]It was 1903 when he made it, so the dude's dead.
[203:48.07]1903.
[203:48.11]Really?
[203:48.39]Was there refrigeration in his lifetime?
[203:51.99]Probably, but like late?
[203:53.79]Not in 1903.
[203:55.29]Was there?
[203:56.19]Who knows?
[203:56.67]I don't know.
[203:57.89]Someone play Civilization and figure out when you get that tech.
[204:02.11]Somebody play Civilization and play as Dr. Oatker.
[204:11.38]What was he a doctor of?
[204:17.07]Frozen pizza.
[204:20.09]If anyone hasn't seen this area before, it's really hard.
[204:22.45]I'm going to have my ultra mutation soon because you kill a lot of stuff.
[204:28.72]He was a Jerma pharmacist.
[204:31.68]He created a recipe for baking powder in 1891.
[204:40.97]I like the guy who kind of got my joke.
[204:44.95]Growing up, I always looked at when I got technologies in Civilization to try and see if it lined up with the actual years, and the guy's just saying, I got guns in 2000.
[204:56.24]It never works out.
[204:57.66]That's funny.
[205:00.04]Okay, let's see.
[205:02.20]I'm glad someone could relate to that experience, though.
[205:08.63]Oh my god, is this the dude?
[205:10.80]This has got to be the guy, right?
[205:13.28]Oh man, yeah.
[205:14.82]This is the dude.
[205:15.64]You try to tell me.
[205:17.30]I want somebody in this chat to try to tell me that this guy... Oh, did I get a good image?
[205:27.91]Oh my god, you're talking about this guy for so long.
[205:30.35]Dude, this guy's awesome.
[205:31.83]He looks like Wilford Brimley.
[205:38.03]Isn't everyone?
[205:38.56]Why can I not get the image link for this?
[205:43.66]Just type in August Ochre into Google.
[205:46.53]He's the guy with the mustache.
[205:47.59]You don't think you can trust that guy with the frozen pizza?
[205:49.51]That guy made a frozen pizza for me right now.
[205:51.43]I'd eat it.
[205:53.64]He looks like he means business.
[206:09.69]I'm having a hard time.
[206:10.25]I don't think I'm having a hard time picking up ammo.
[206:12.19]I'm having a hard time finding fucking shotgun ammo every time it's bolts.
[206:17.16]99 bolts.
[206:31.75]I have to like look at that picture when I'm done streaming.
[206:34.61]Apparently it's a hit.
[206:35.37]It's pretty funny.
[206:41.31]Dude, like, if people are linking a picture of you with the quote, like, it's pretty funny.
[206:49.21]Like, come on.
[206:53.04]Show some respect to the late Wilford Brimley.
[206:55.50]Dr. Ochre.
[207:03.35]What else does he make?
[207:04.05]What else has he made in his life?
[207:08.74]Because one technological advancement is chump change.
[207:12.52]You had to have done more, right?
[207:13.87]That's not it.
[207:14.39]You didn't fucking waste your whole life, right?
[207:17.71]I mean, if you invented baking powder, you probably did some other cool shit.
[207:21.91]I don't know, dude.
[207:22.39]I already did something today.
[207:26.55]I'm done.
[207:32.00]I think I'm gonna take the B mutation, because I could still get Rhino Skin.
[207:36.20]Actually, do I even give a shit about Rhino Skin?
[207:38.48]He didn't do anything else.
[207:41.78]He just invented Baking Powder and then just cached in.
[207:48.99]I'm on his wiki page right now, it's like one paragraph.
[207:52.73]He made Baking Powder and then he cached in, is how this really reads to me.
[207:57.75]A mutation is obviously the better one.
[208:01.56]But I always take this one.
[208:04.26]I don't know.
[208:13.81]Just invented baking powder.
[208:16.53]Yeah, I feel like we're not given that... Whatever.
[208:18.69]Let's have a decent melting run.
[208:20.17]If it goes well, I can end after this.
[208:23.51]You keep talking about it, though.
[208:25.25]No, it's an interesting topic.
[208:29.61]I did not know that the guy whose company makes my favorite frozen pizza is the guy that invented one of the most important things in all of cooking and baking ever.
[208:38.13]I didn't know that.
[208:46.98]You want to know why you don't know that?
[208:48.10]Because you, like, don't have an education.
[208:49.72]Come on, sit down.
[209:04.20]He earned his PhD in deliciousness.
[209:06.22]Yeah, he did.
[209:12.43]He made baking powder and died.
[209:14.01]Did he really?
[209:15.79]Is that like... That was his crowning achievement?
[209:17.77]He didn't get... Wow.
[209:18.69]Is that real?
[209:19.29]That's sad.
[209:21.72]He's like holding up the flask.
[209:23.38]I did it.
[209:24.34]I've created the most... I kind of don't feel good.
[209:28.68]And he dies when he goes... Like immediately after.
[209:31.66]Yeah.
[209:32.52]Yeah.
[209:34.41]He's got like the bubbling flask in his hands and all of a sudden he's just like goes pale.
[209:38.13]He's like, shit, I don't, something's wrong here.
[209:40.43]Let me just let him rest in peace.
[209:51.71]You see kids, if you don't go to school, you'll make baking powder and die.
[209:59.74]Death by inventing baking powder.
[210:01.90]That's what killed him.
[210:03.72]The invention itself, like the excitement or something, something related, that's what got him.
[210:17.01]Smoke making?
[210:19.71]No, yeah, don't, don't do that.
[210:27.02]See, this is why we took the A mutation.
[210:35.02]well if there's any any summarization of this the pizzas are very good there you go you suggesting people buy a pizza or like try a frozen pizza led into the life story of the man who made it yeah good and he didn't even actually
[210:58.49]Yeah, but he made the baking powder that was responsible for part of that dough.
[211:02.39]No, and he's shaking his fist because one of his shit-like sons that inherited his millions that he didn't want to have it stole his name and is using him to sell pizza.
[211:13.26]Or, see, or, or, on his deathbed, his son leaned in and he grabbed him and pulled him in and was like, I've always wanted to make pizzas.
[211:23.38]And he dies.
[211:24.70]So the son's like, we gotta make pizzas.
[211:29.52]I took that the other way around.
[211:32.56]The son pulled him forward while he's dying and said, I've always wanted to make pizzas, and, like, Dad, like, you never let me.
[211:39.56]And then he spent the rest of his life ruining his name making pizzas.
[211:43.00]Like, that's the way you phrased it.
[211:45.76]The other way around.
[211:47.02]Oh, my head.
[211:47.60]I always wanted to make pizzas, Dad.
[211:53.53]Fuck you.
[211:54.21]And then he dies.
[211:56.67]No, no, it was supposed to be, like, Dr. Oetker was like, listen, son, the secret recipe for pizza is, like, underneath my fucking cabinet.
[212:03.84]It's cheese and bread.
[212:15.97]This is getting really stupid.
[212:18.43]It's cheese.
[212:19.99]It's the secret recipe.
[212:21.77]It's cheese and bread.
[212:23.77]And the son's just like, son's sitting there like, uh, yeah, I know.
[212:29.25]It's the easiest fucking thing to make on Earth.
[212:34.61]Did he look Italian?
[212:35.77]Did the guy look Italian at least?
[212:37.80]No, not really.
[212:38.74]He's Jerma.
[212:42.34]Then fuck that guy.
[212:45.65]The recipe is on the computer.
[212:47.43]They didn't have computers in like 1903.
[212:51.77]I think he did.
[212:52.47]He was one of the elite.
[212:54.95]That's funny.
[212:55.67]I love funny things.
[212:58.42]Oh, me too.
[212:58.88]I adore funny things.
[213:03.76]I always wanted to make pizzas.
[213:05.20]The secret recipe is cheese and bread.
[213:09.42]It's extremely secret.
[213:11.93]Nobody knows about this.
[213:14.31]Except you do now.
[213:15.94]My son.
[213:19.54]Wow, like elderly dementia is funny.
[213:23.96]Like a Joe over here, like a bad guy making fun of people with Alzheimer's.
[213:28.76]What?
[213:29.48]This is us?
[213:30.73]Whatever.
[213:41.75]Where does the tyranny end?
[213:46.73]We might actually get to see what changed in the throne fight after this.
[213:50.36]That'd be cool.
[213:59.63]I personally have not seen that.
[214:01.19]And wow, this really pulls you now.
[214:04.61]It's pretty hard to go back for your gun.
[214:06.01]You have to be a ways back.
[214:17.27]I wonder, I really do wonder what the story is or why that they started using his name for pizza.
[214:22.70]I wonder what that, like, how do you go from baking powder to pizza?
[214:25.84]Yeah, that's different.
[214:28.20]I don't know, he uses baking powder to make the pizza.
[214:30.79]I don't know, we'll look it up.
[214:43.37]So Dr. Oaker is gonna be in the next Jermaine.
[214:45.75]Yeah, you know, he has to be at this point.
[214:48.95]No one's gonna get the reference.
[214:50.89]I don't care.
[214:52.97]I'll just do like an ad for Dr. Oaker.
[214:54.81]I don't even care.
[214:55.81]I'm gonna do like an ad for Dr. Oaker's pizza, and he's gonna come out.
[214:58.60]I hope this song shows up.
[215:08.72]I wonder what would happen.
[215:09.38]Would I get, like, sued?
[215:10.44]I don't think so.
[215:12.44]If I, like, use the box and everything, like, Dr. Oakers.
[215:15.40]Ristorante pizza.
[215:16.72]Crispiest crust.
[215:17.88]I mean, it's possible.
[215:18.86]Do you think I'd get sued?
[215:20.50]I don't think you would.
[215:23.56]What are the... If we're talking, like, percentage-wise, like, 100% is you are being sued, and 0% is you are not being sued.
[215:28.88]Where's it at? 20%?
[215:37.79]That's a little high.
[215:41.90]Even 20 seems a little high actually.
[215:43.66]With Bloodlust and being able to kill everything like that, I really like this melting build.
[215:58.65]This is what I should have done for freaking daily.
[216:08.41]I'm kind of in between like I don't know who my favorite character in this game is anymore.
[216:12.45]Everything I liked got nerfed.
[216:15.41]Oh, I gotta read that, somebody wrote something funny.
[216:21.23]It's about how the guy, it's like a family of doctors.
[216:26.35]They're all doctors.
[216:27.63]Except for the one son who grabbed him in his deathbed and said, I wanted to make pizza.
[216:32.86]The R. Oetker is a family-owned enterprise which is headed in the fourth generation by Dr. H.C.
[216:39.30]August Oetker.
[216:40.74]And he says, what the fuck is the doctorate hereditary?
[216:46.66]They just, uh... They just, you know, maybe they all followed their father's footsteps.
[216:54.89]Look, I fucking love the Oetker family.
[216:57.43]If they make pizzas this good, love you.
[217:00.59]Love them.
[217:05.60]I don't really care much for him.
[217:06.60]I'm like talking like I know them.
[217:15.06]You like just found out he's a real person.
[217:18.37]Yeah, I just found out 25 minutes ago that this was a real person, a human being.
[217:24.05]I thought it was like Betty Crocker or something.
[217:25.65]Betty Crocker is real too, right?
[217:28.33]Wait.
[217:29.87]Is Betty Crocker real?
[217:31.01]Is Betty Crocker a real person?
[217:34.16]Oh, there's new enemies in here, by the way, guys.
[217:35.76]If you're, like, not seeing them behind the explosions, there's, like, much bigger alligators that spawn in the loop now.
[217:41.62]Yeah, but Betty Crocker's not a real... There's no real... There's no Betsy Crocker that exists.
[218:03.10]Oh, fuck!
[218:07.67]Isn't there another one?
[218:08.41]Who's the other one?
[218:09.31]There's, like, a couple of them, right?
[218:10.54]Can I, like, not get past this area?
[218:13.68]What's the other one?
[218:14.16]It's, like, a pastry name.
[218:15.30]It's, like, a person's name for, like, pastries.
[218:18.36]Oh, I knew that was going to happen.
[218:19.50]Those guys are kind of rough.
[218:21.24]We're talking about, like, every time you're on my stream and I play, like, Nuclear Throne, we're always talking about two different things.
[218:28.03]Why didn't you just ask?
[218:29.51]This is extremely important.
[218:30.75]There's, like, the other names of, like, the people, like, for pastries and cakes and stuff.
[218:34.97]Papa John isn't real.
[218:37.45]No, come on, come on, help me out here.
[218:39.75]Betty Crocker.
[218:41.79]You're getting the big ones already.
[218:43.89]No, no, there's another one, there's another really big one.
[218:47.15]Aunt Jemima.
[218:48.41]Aunt Jemima.
[218:49.23]Aunt Jemima.
[218:50.33]Uncle Ben, there's another one.
[218:51.73]Uncle Ben.
[218:52.25]Hey, Aunt Jemima is... Uncle Ben's dead.
[218:56.33]We're talking about Little Debbie.
[218:57.95]Is Little Debbie real?
[219:03.32]I think so.
[219:04.08]Paula Deen.
[219:08.31]The Michelin Man.
[219:11.49]No, the Michelin Man isn't real.
[219:13.74]Didn't you try and make him for the Jerma Rumble and it didn't work out or something?
[219:17.86]Yeah, it didn't work out.
[219:19.14]Pillsbury Doughboy or something.
[219:21.50]No, I wanted to make the Michelin Man.
[219:23.24]It just wasn't possible.
[219:24.40]You couldn't get a guy with that many rings in him?
[219:27.66]You just don't.
[219:28.24]Not possible.
[219:29.24]It would have been really, really funny if I could actually get it to work, though.
[219:33.83]He would have looked so stupid, too.
[219:35.29]Like, can you imagine, like, just a guy with a bunch of rings around him?
[219:38.07]Like, it wouldn't even look anything like the Michelin Man.
[219:41.87]Mr. Clean?
[219:42.47]Is Mr. Clean real?
[219:45.39]No.
[219:46.71]Did a guy have the last name Clean and go like, oh, this is what I must do?
[219:51.28]Didn't they actually use a live- There was an actual guy that was in the commercials.
[219:55.42]He became the Clean guy.
[220:03.08]Okay, Mr. Clean is actually named different things in different parts of the world.
[220:09.53]In Spain, he is Don Limpio.
[220:13.37]What?
[220:15.45]Yeah, his name is Don Limpio in Spain.
[220:19.55]In Mexico, he's Maestro Limpio.
[220:22.11]Maestro Limpio.
[220:24.15]Maestro Proper.
[220:26.94]I like that one.
[220:28.58]What's with the Canada one?
[220:30.02]MrCleanM.net
[220:33.91]What?
[220:34.55]Mr. Clean Mnet.
[220:36.57]Why not just call him Mr. Clean, Canada?
[220:38.23]What's going on?
[220:38.85]What's going on there?
[220:39.37]Why do you add an Mnet to that?
[220:40.39]I don't know.
[220:44.97]It's a good question.
[220:47.24]Mr. Clean Mnet.
[220:57.26]That doesn't even sound real.
[221:00.82]Limpio means I clean.
[221:02.86]So Don, I clean.
[221:04.06]Okay, that's cool.
[221:06.41]I clean Don's.
[221:08.35]You have a Don, I clean it.
[221:11.73]Good joke.
[221:14.35]Oh, I don't have, um... Anybody in Canada?
[221:16.73]Any Canadians watching that can confirm that it's MrCleanMNet?
[221:20.68]And do they have any kind of Canadian explanation why?
[221:26.46]Well, we're out here in Canada.
[221:28.30]Canada.
[221:30.13]That's the explanation.
[221:34.25]Oh, okay.
[221:34.89]Mr. Clean and Mr. Net.
[221:37.21]Mr. Net for the French Canadians.
[221:39.66]Okay.
[221:40.70]Oh, there you go, dude.
[221:41.92]I get it now.
[221:43.42]You're a moron.
[221:45.28]What?
[221:46.10]No.
[221:47.84]You're the one doing your, like, fake people research.
[221:50.94]Like, get it right.
[221:57.22]Mr. Clean Jingle.
[222:01.62]Alright, Star, I'll give you $1,000 right now.
[222:03.58]You have 10 seconds.
[222:04.34]Do the whole Mr. Clean jingle.
[222:05.82]$1,000.
[222:06.10]$1,000.
[222:06.12]Go.
[222:07.12]Can't do it.
[222:09.17]You've lost.
[222:11.99]I've lost.
[222:15.19]And if I got that $1,000, I would make you do the full something jingle.
[222:21.18]I don't even know.
[222:21.78]What's another jingle?
[222:24.42]There's a lot of them.
[222:28.21]Wasn't the Mr. Clean one pretty long, though?
[222:30.17]I feel like there's multiple parts to it that I couldn't think of.
[222:33.03]It wasn't very long.
[222:35.15]I was guaranteed to not have to pay you $1,000 because there's no way any human being would even... Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[222:43.95]Is that it?
[222:45.17]Kind of.
[222:45.61]The ad agency that did this probably, if you pulled one of those guys over and were like, excuse me, sir, I just got a license and registration.
[222:52.45]Do the Mr. Clean song.
[222:54.21]They wouldn't even know.
[222:56.37]License registration, Mr. Cleansong.
[223:01.50]You can't do it.
[223:02.46]You must be drunk.
[223:03.34]Put him in lockup.
[223:09.58]Imagine that was like staple.
[223:11.42]License registration, please.
[223:12.76]Mr. Cleansong.
[223:15.16]Mr. Cleansong backwards.
[223:17.84]And they do it, it's like, okay, alright, sir.
[223:20.42]Get out of here.
[223:21.44]I know I'm not the only one who's really thought about that before.
[223:24.59]Like, the drunk test doing the alphabet backwards.
[223:27.93]I can't get past, like, three.
[223:29.11]Uh, Z, X, Y, Z, Y, X, W. No, done.
[223:34.86]I lost.
[223:35.78]I can't, I can never think of the W.
[223:39.61]I don't know if they just like... Their standards of how smart a human being are beyond me.
[223:46.29]I don't know.
[223:47.15]I feel like really stupid.
[223:49.97]And it keeps me up at night.
[223:53.37]I wouldn't be able to get... I don't know.
[223:55.62]No way.
[224:01.40]I think this might be the last run, by the way, folks.
[224:04.42]It's getting late, and I want to keep my bedtime.
[224:06.66]And I can already tell I'm playing like I don't really give a shit.
[224:11.59]The moment I picked up the lightning rifle, I was like, yeah, I don't think I care.
[224:14.53]But we're going to try and go as far as we can on this run.
[224:21.17]And then I'm going to go to bed.
[224:23.09]I'm also sweating in here again.
[224:28.30]When's the last time you, like, sweat so much you can see the sweat stains in your armpits?
[224:33.42]Um... I don't know, a lot.
[224:36.20]Really?
[224:37.12]Yeah, cause I'm, like, outside with a t-shirt on, like, running around doing all kinds of shit.
[224:42.03]I guess I don't do much.
[224:46.25]Well, this would be twice today.
[224:48.63]I fucking sweat through shirts, though, like, I'm just, like, a sweatball.
[224:52.07]Like, I'm, like, a sweaty guy.
[224:54.87]I'm just a ball, you know like the ball of spiders in Hearthstone?
[224:57.94]I'm a ball of sweat.
[225:00.08]Yeah, I needed to know Hearthstone to get that.
[225:03.80]When I was, uh, we were moving all the boxes and everything, I really don't, I can't remember another time in my life that this happened.
[225:08.96]It probably has.
[225:10.38]But like, I had the full, like, your back of your shirt, and you're sweating a lot.
[225:15.23]You need help.
[225:16.91]Like, stop for a bit.
[225:19.23]Like, your whole back is sweating.
[225:21.23]My back doesn't sweat.
[225:24.54]I just like, I could be sitting there just doing nothing and all of a sudden I'm just like, why am I like, what's going on here?
[225:29.62]Karma does things, I know.
[225:30.80]What do you do?
[225:34.53]Um, a lot of things.
[225:36.87]Wouldn't you like to know?
[225:38.15]I would.
[225:39.83]I want some proof.
[225:45.34]Okay.
[225:46.66]Today I got up.
[225:49.20]I walked up the stairs, I got some food.
[225:52.54]I went immediately back to bed.
[225:53.88]And then I was sweating.
[225:55.48]I thought that's where you were going to start sweating.
[225:59.92]I went upstairs and got some food.
[226:01.12]By the time I was done eating, I was out of breath from eating this food.
[226:07.61]It's not like, oh man, I stink.
[226:10.99]No, it's just like water.
[226:13.19]Water comes out of me.
[226:14.61]Don't know why.
[226:17.45]Is it red?
[226:19.92]No.
[226:21.22]Is someone cutting you?
[226:23.66]Water just comes out of me.
[226:24.74]I don't understand.
[226:26.36]Yeah, sometimes I'll go into the bathroom and water comes out of me.
[226:29.78]It's so weird.
[226:30.38]Are you urinating?
[226:35.92]Is that what it's called?
[226:38.56]Oh.
[226:40.05]I thought I was just sweating out of my face.
[226:46.87]Oh!
[226:47.53]Oh, that's what that is.
[226:48.89]Along with your, like, I don't know what a sneeze joke.
[226:52.04]Where you, like, love that I don't know what a sneeze is joke.
[226:55.28]What do you, what, what?
[226:58.48]Where you, like, sneeze and ask to go to the hospital.
[227:00.46]Oh, I love that.
[227:01.10]Because you don't know what a sneeze is, and you're, like, scared.
[227:03.30]I love that joke.
[227:04.56]That's one of my favorite gags.
[227:07.43]It doesn't translate well.
[227:08.85]No, no, no, it's not I don't know what a sneeze is, it's I sneezed and something really bad happened.
[227:14.21]Oh.
[227:15.06]Like, you like ruptured your spleen and you're like, hospital.
[227:19.50]That's all you can say before, you know, you sneeze again.
[227:26.45]Hospital.
[227:29.07]You're in a shitty situation if all you can say is hospital.
[227:35.99]Yeah, you're in pretty bad shape.
[227:38.59]The only thing you can say is hospital.
[227:41.60]That's the only word that gets out.
[227:45.63]Then yeah, damn.
[227:46.55]You're getting your point across, aren't you?
[227:49.31]Yeah, you are.
[227:51.06]But your point is a dire situation.
[227:53.62]Why would you... What, are you going to reach out if you're in pain and be like, Look, excuse me, sir.
[227:59.28]I have to go to the hospital.
[228:00.74]No, that's too much.
[228:01.72]Just hospital.
[228:04.16]I understand everything you're telling me.
[228:06.64]If you come up to me and you look in a dire situation and you say hospital, I know exactly what you mean.
[228:10.28]Then I'm sprinting in the other direction.
[228:13.94]Go ahead.
[228:14.46]I don't need to know you.
[228:16.02]Like, you're trying to involve your problems into my life.
[228:18.10]I have enough problems, kid.
[228:21.75]Well.
[228:24.53]Well, now we all know the kind of person Star is.
[228:27.25]Don't say hospital to him.
[228:28.35]He'll just, like, walk away from you.
[228:31.43]See, I'll load you up in my car, and we'll go right to that hospital.
[228:35.31]I'm taking all of these the wrong way!
[228:39.07]I was like, I'll load you up in my car and, like, you're not making it out alive.
[228:44.58]I don't know why I just... I don't know, I just started thinking about Hannibal Lecter or something.
[228:48.52]Like, he puts the girl in the back with the couch.
[228:52.77]So you just translated me saying that I was going to help someone and drive them to the hospital to I'm Hannibal Lecter.
[229:00.17]Yeah, because I noticed they have that Hannibal show that has, like, two or three seasons, and I was, like, thinking, like, oh, maybe I should watch that the other day.
[229:06.87]So, like, you said you're putting someone in the back of your car.
[229:09.25]I'm like, oh, fucking getting Hannibaled.
[229:13.45]Sorry.
[229:17.57]Different folks for different strokes.
[229:20.87]Stroke and folks.
[229:23.41]You know, this downstairs area, this is a really good Kinect area.
[229:28.64]Just realized that.
[229:30.88]Dude, my living room, I would never buy a Kinect, but I sat there for a second and I was like, I could actually own one of those.
[229:41.10]I have enough room.
[229:42.14]How big of a dork do you have to be to gauge how much space you have in your house by if you can own a Kinect or not?
[229:50.92]I've never been able to utter out loud, hey, wow, a Kinect could work in here.
[229:57.83]Now I can.
[229:58.91]I'm so glad that we can relate on this.
[230:01.77]Because I don't think anyone else gets us right now.
[230:04.33]They don't even get us.
[230:06.82]We're talking about you!
[230:07.84]I should have taken the shotgun for this.
[230:20.61]Oh shit, I'm getting Hannibaled.
[230:27.27]Yeah, man.
[230:28.87]Dude's gonna eat you.
[230:32.47]Oh wait, no, that wasn't even Hannibal who did that.
[230:36.91]That was, uh, that was Buckaroo Joe.
[230:39.21]Or whatever his name was.
[230:41.97]What the fuck are you talking about?
[230:43.61]In the show, in the movie, Hannibal.
[230:45.87]The Silence of the Lambs.
[230:47.58]Buffalo Bill?
[230:48.38]Buffalo Bill, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[230:50.04]Buckaroo Jones.
[230:52.30]I was close.
[230:53.06]Okay, we were talking about, like, you just said, like, the off-brand Buffalo Bill.
[230:58.66]I see Buckaroo Jones on the shelf, and it's filled with fucking Froot Loops.
[231:08.61]We're a dynamic duo, man.
[231:11.75]That's all I got to say about that.
[231:15.37]He doesn't even, like, get us.
[231:16.67]Fuck a rude Jones.
[231:22.17]I can hear Ashley laughing in the other room.
[231:25.73]Like, what has she caught up to and thought was funny?
[231:27.81]I don't know.
[231:36.90]I can hear, yeah, she's just a little... Yeah, she's just, now she's, now I know for a fact she's laughing that we heard her laugh.
[231:43.20]That's the kind of thing she would find funny.
[231:44.96]And now she's gonna- like she's- gets in like laughing fits.
[231:47.52]I don't know how to stop her.
[231:48.38]Sometimes I just get a hammer.
[231:56.24]She's- I can still hear her.
[232:04.31]Oh god, I'm moving on with my life.
[232:07.91]That's- my door is closed!
[232:14.14]That's run over.
[232:18.23]You have any closing statements?
[232:19.77]Because I'm done.
[232:22.27]Open my door a little.
[232:23.79]My closing statement is I love y'all.
[232:28.27]Have a very good night.
[232:29.27]Wow.
[232:31.82]That's a really nice one.
[232:33.26]Very positive.
[232:34.24]Very positive.
[232:37.23]That van still showed up really fast, by the way.
[232:39.90]I just wanted to say that before.
[232:41.54]That's my closing statement.
[232:42.82]Like, that van really showed up.
[232:49.05]And they're gonna put me in the back of it, I suppose.
